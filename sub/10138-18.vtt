07:15.143 --> 07:16.644
Absolutely, you-you guys..

07:15.143 --> 07:16.644
You-you were..

07:16.686 --> 07:18.105
You were total,

07:16.686 --> 07:18.105
You were deaf, you were fresh

07:18.146 --> 07:21.066
you were chillin',

07:18.146 --> 07:21.066
you were flyin'..

07:21.108 --> 07:23.735
You kids, uh, actually use

07:21.108 --> 07:23.735
any of those hip words still?

07:23.777 --> 07:25.528
Yeah, we do.

07:23.777 --> 07:25.528
But I'm gonna stop.

07:27.281 --> 07:28.656
Alright, grown-ups,

07:27.281 --> 07:28.656
come on, out of the room.

07:28.698 --> 07:30.242
Let's go. We gotta

07:28.698 --> 07:30.242
rehearse some more.

07:30.284 --> 07:31.701
- Thank you.

07:30.284 --> 07:31.701
- Alright. Have fun, you guys.

07:31.743 --> 07:33.412
Alright, guys, let's

07:31.743 --> 07:33.412
take it from the top.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.205
Come on,

07:33.453 --> 07:35.205
Uncle Slavedriver.

07:35.247 --> 07:36.415
Can't we take a break?

07:36.456 --> 07:38.208
We've been

07:36.456 --> 07:38.208
rehearsing forever.

07:38.250 --> 07:40.460
Look at this. My blisters

07:38.250 --> 07:40.460
are getting blisters.

07:40.501 --> 07:42.129
- I realize that--

07:40.501 --> 07:42.129
- Come on! Please.

07:42.170 --> 07:44.131
Guys, please,

07:42.170 --> 07:44.131
if you wanna be a good band

07:44.172 --> 07:45.840
you gotta rehearse,

07:44.172 --> 07:45.840
rehearse, rehearse

07:45.882 --> 07:47.217
until you get it perfect.

07:47.259 --> 07:48.843
How can someone so mean

07:48.885 --> 07:50.511
have such great hair?

07:52.889 --> 07:54.808
Alright, what the heck?

07:52.889 --> 07:54.808
Take five.

07:54.849 --> 07:57.144
- Alright, let's hit the mall.

07:54.849 --> 07:57.144
- Yeah.

07:57.185 --> 07:59.646
We can pick out cool outfits

07:57.185 --> 07:59.646
to wear for the contest.

07:59.687 --> 08:02.816
Now, guys, I-I said five..

07:59.687 --> 08:02.816
That's five minutes.

08:02.857 --> 08:04.359
Alright, take ten minutes.

08:02.857 --> 08:04.359
What the heck?

08:04.401 --> 08:07.279
You said nice things

08:04.401 --> 08:07.279
about my hair.

08:07.321 --> 08:09.864
Or let's just call it lunch.

08:07.321 --> 08:09.864
Let's just have a little lunch.

08:11.658 --> 08:12.826
[indistinct chatter]

08:15.203 --> 08:17.705
Okay, everybody,

08:15.203 --> 08:17.705
let's work on our look.

08:17.747 --> 08:20.041
It should be vulnerable,

08:17.747 --> 08:20.041
yet tough.

08:23.462 --> 08:24.629
Tougher!

08:27.424 --> 08:30.135
Come on, Tanner, can't you

08:27.424 --> 08:30.135
get any tougher than that?

08:30.177 --> 08:33.263
Not without spraining my face.

08:33.305 --> 08:35.265
- Let's work on our hair.

08:33.305 --> 08:35.265
- Yeah.

08:39.644 --> 08:42.897
We better go.

08:39.644 --> 08:42.897
It could be contagious.

08:42.939 --> 08:45.359
We're practicing how to pose

08:42.939 --> 08:45.359
for our album cover.

08:45.400 --> 08:47.610
Sorry, we thought

08:45.400 --> 08:47.610
you had cooties.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.364
Actually,

08:49.029 --> 08:50.364
we're here because

08:50.405 --> 08:53.700
we maybe of some assistance

08:50.405 --> 08:53.700
to your ensemble.

08:55.494 --> 08:58.205
Look, unless you're

08:55.494 --> 08:58.205
here to help the band, get lost.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.708
Kimmy, stay with me on this.

09:01.749 --> 09:03.626
Derek and Lisa

09:01.749 --> 09:03.626
are great singers.

09:03.668 --> 09:05.045
If you let them in the band

09:05.086 --> 09:07.755
you'd definitely

09:05.086 --> 09:07.755
win the contest.

09:07.797 --> 09:09.257
Excuse me when I say.

09:09.299 --> 09:10.675
Bwaha ha ha ha.

09:12.927 --> 09:14.221
I was afraid of this.

09:14.262 --> 09:15.930
The risk of humiliation

09:15.972 --> 09:18.058
has borne bitter fruit.

09:19.767 --> 09:21.269
Alright, Michelle, you

09:19.767 --> 09:21.269
and your friends, beat it.

09:21.311 --> 09:22.770
I gotta work with the band.

09:22.812 --> 09:24.856
You can start on

09:22.812 --> 09:24.856
their personalities.

09:27.192 --> 09:29.152
Alright, troops, break's over.

09:27.192 --> 09:29.152
Let's hit the studio. Come on.

09:29.194 --> 09:31.946
Uncle Jesse, we've already

09:29.194 --> 09:31.946
got the music part down.

09:31.988 --> 09:34.032
Now we need to work on our look.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.616
You already got the look.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.616
You look like four girls

09:35.658 --> 09:37.577
who need to rehearse.

09:37.618 --> 09:40.288
Look, I'm not gonna be on

09:37.618 --> 09:40.288
the side of that stage callin'

09:37.618 --> 09:40.288
out chords to you guys.

09:40.330 --> 09:42.582
Oh, like we can't

09:40.330 --> 09:42.582
remember three chords?

09:42.623 --> 09:43.750
A, E..

09:47.045 --> 09:48.213
...I, O, U.

09:50.173 --> 09:52.259
Come on, Uncle Jesse,

09:50.173 --> 09:52.259
what's the big deal?

09:52.300 --> 09:54.261
Dad and Aunt Becky

09:52.300 --> 09:54.261
said, we were great.

09:54.302 --> 09:55.595
Yeah, they said

09:54.302 --> 09:55.595
we were great--

09:55.636 --> 09:57.180
Of course they did.

09:55.636 --> 09:57.180
They're family.

09:57.222 --> 09:58.890
I'm your manager.

09:57.222 --> 09:58.890
I'm gonna tell you the truth.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.808
The truth is you just

09:58.932 --> 10:00.808
wanna boss us around.

10:00.850 --> 10:02.561
The truth is, you guys

10:00.850 --> 10:02.561
made a million mistakes.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.521
- Now let's hit the studio.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.521
- Name one.

10:04.563 --> 10:06.314
Alright,

10:04.563 --> 10:06.314
let's start with you.

10:06.356 --> 10:08.108
You missed about three

10:06.356 --> 10:08.108
or four chord changes.

10:08.149 --> 10:09.692
You were flat

10:08.149 --> 10:09.692
on the first verse.

10:09.734 --> 10:11.652
Your guitar playing slowed

10:09.734 --> 10:11.652
the whole song down--

10:11.694 --> 10:13.696
I said one.

10:13.738 --> 10:15.407
I mean, give us

10:13.738 --> 10:15.407
a break, Uncle Jesse.

10:15.449 --> 10:16.950
- It sounded, okay.

10:15.449 --> 10:16.950
- 'Okay?'

10:16.991 --> 10:18.618
Okay is not gonna cut it,

10:16.991 --> 10:18.618
alright?

10:18.659 --> 10:20.954
You guys aren't ready

10:18.659 --> 10:20.954
to perform in front of people.

10:20.995 --> 10:22.789
Now what you gotta do is,

10:20.995 --> 10:22.789
practice over and over

10:22.830 --> 10:25.375
and, over again, till you can

10:22.830 --> 10:25.375
play this stuff in your sleep.

10:25.417 --> 10:27.794
- Any other complains?

10:25.417 --> 10:27.794
- Yeah, you have a bad attitude.

10:27.835 --> 10:29.879
Well, that's because

10:27.835 --> 10:29.879
you're a bad manager.

10:31.881 --> 10:33.758
Steph, I don't..

10:31.881 --> 10:33.758
I don't really need this.

10:33.800 --> 10:36.970
- Well, we don't need you.

10:33.800 --> 10:36.970
- Really?

10:37.011 --> 10:38.846
So you guys are firing me?

10:38.888 --> 10:41.141
We can't fire you!

10:38.888 --> 10:41.141
You quit!

10:42.601 --> 10:44.102
Kimmy, I'll handle this.

10:44.144 --> 10:45.520
You know, Stephanie,

10:44.144 --> 10:45.520
I'm sorry I got involved

10:45.562 --> 10:46.813
in your little band

10:45.562 --> 10:46.813
in the first place.

10:46.854 --> 10:48.398
Not as sorry

10:46.854 --> 10:48.398
as we are.

10:48.440 --> 10:52.360
Yeah. Pack it up,

10:48.440 --> 10:52.360
Uncle Hairboy.

10:52.402 --> 10:55.489
You know, Kimmy, I think

10:52.402 --> 10:55.489
<i>I won't</i> miss you most of all.

10:58.450 --> 11:00.994
That's it.

10:58.450 --> 11:00.994

11:14.257 --> 11:16.009
I'm checking right now, partner.

11:16.050 --> 11:19.638

11:16.050 --> 11:19.638
Oh!

11:19.678 --> 11:20.972
What?

11:19.678 --> 11:20.972
Wh-what happened?

11:21.014 --> 11:24.017
- It's down six points.

11:21.014 --> 11:24.017
- That's awful.

11:24.058 --> 11:25.101
Well, it could've

11:24.058 --> 11:25.101
been a lot worse.

11:25.143 --> 11:26.645
How?

11:26.685 --> 11:30.398
I could've invested

11:26.685 --> 11:30.398
as much money as you did.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.317
Hey, guys, do you have

11:30.440 --> 11:32.317

11:32.359 --> 11:33.692

11:32.359 --> 11:33.692

11:40.200 --> 11:41.451

11:40.200 --> 11:41.451
- Yeah.

11:41.493 --> 11:43.161
- Good thing.

11:41.493 --> 11:43.161
- It's a good thing.

11:52.295 --> 11:53.838
Yeah. We practiced all day.

11:53.880 --> 11:56.757

11:56.799 --> 12:00.178
No, we practiced

11:56.799 --> 12:00.178
our choreography.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.639

12:00.220 --> 12:02.639
you need to practice.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.735
What're you talkin' about? It

12:54.441 --> 12:56.735
went down six points yesterday.

That's when I bought it,

12:56.775 --> 12:59.028
at it's all time low.

12:59.070 --> 13:00.697
It went up 20 points today.

13:00.739 --> 13:02.990
So I sold it and made

13:00.739 --> 13:02.990
a tidy, little profit.
