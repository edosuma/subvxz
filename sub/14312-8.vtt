WEBVTT

00:37.626 --> 00:39.545
<i>Lasers. How original.</i>

01:13.620 --> 01:17.207
<i>Identity confirmed:
Menken-comma-Donald.</i>

01:22.462 --> 01:26.133
Trust me, kid.
You don't want no part of this.

01:26.300 --> 01:27.634
Wow. Sorry.

01:27.801 --> 01:29.720
I had no idea Tombstone
was bidding.

01:29.886 --> 01:31.930
No harm, no foul, kitten.

01:32.097 --> 01:35.642
But this little chew toy
is strictly for the big dogs.

01:35.809 --> 01:39.354
So scat, Cat.

01:49.906 --> 01:53.452
Now, gentlemen,
shall we get down to business?

02:57.099 --> 02:58.850
Our final bidder should arrive soon.

02:59.017 --> 03:00.519
Wait a minute, Menken.

03:00.686 --> 03:03.063
You said this was a closed auction.

03:03.230 --> 03:06.108
Nothing's closed
to Silvio Manfredi's daughter.

03:06.274 --> 03:08.735
You should know that by now,
Hamster.

03:10.696 --> 03:14.574
Little Sable, all grown up.

03:14.741 --> 03:17.953
- A girl grows up fast in this company.
- Yeah.

03:18.120 --> 03:20.789
Welcome to the freak show.

03:20.997 --> 03:24.126
Gentlemen and lady,
do you know why we're here?

03:24.292 --> 03:26.294
Shall we open the bidding
at 500,000?

03:26.461 --> 03:29.548
It'll make such a nice homecoming gift
for my father.

03:29.715 --> 03:31.341
- Six hundred.
- Seven hundred.

03:31.508 --> 03:32.759
Eight hundred.

03:32.926 --> 03:33.969
- Nine hundred.
- A mil!

03:34.136 --> 03:35.679
- One-point-five.
- Two.

03:35.846 --> 03:39.474
- Two million dollars and one cent!
- Fifty million.

03:39.641 --> 03:41.685
Why drag this out?

03:41.852 --> 03:43.228
Mr. Kingsley, I'm afraid
your bid exceeds...

03:43.395 --> 03:45.689
...the amount deposited
in your bidding account.

03:45.856 --> 03:48.066
In fact, it exceeds everyone's.

03:48.233 --> 03:51.153
I'll transfer the balance
when the bank opens in the morning.

03:51.319 --> 03:52.487
- We'll do the same.
- Yeah!

03:52.654 --> 03:54.364
Then we'll resume tomorrow night.

03:57.784 --> 03:59.911
Someone needs to watch your back.

04:00.078 --> 04:02.622
That's why all our officers
have partners in the field.

04:02.789 --> 04:05.876
For example, if Mr. Thompson
and Mr. Parker shared a squad car--

04:06.042 --> 04:07.794
Couldn't I have
a police dog instead?

04:07.961 --> 04:09.838
You know, for the extra IQ points?

04:10.005 --> 04:14.634
Wisecracks don't save lives, Pete.
As I'm sure you know.

04:17.971 --> 04:20.223
Sorry, Hobie. Hold that thought.

04:22.017 --> 04:24.686
Dude!
Is that an OsCorp OzBerry?

04:24.853 --> 04:27.355
GPS, Internet, holographic display.

04:27.522 --> 04:30.025
This is a prototype.
It's not even on the market yet.

04:30.192 --> 04:31.651
Yeah, your dad gave it to me.

04:32.944 --> 04:35.614
To keep track of me, I guess.
It's a mentor-mentee thing.

04:35.781 --> 04:40.035
- I never use it--
- It's cool, Pete. I'm used to it.

04:42.037 --> 04:46.249
- Petey! Italian or French?
- Spanish, actually.

04:46.416 --> 04:48.251
- Next period.
- Hello?

04:48.418 --> 04:49.920
For our dinner tonight?

04:50.086 --> 04:52.339
Oh, man!

04:52.506 --> 04:56.176
I promised Mr. Foswell
I'd stop by the <i>Bugle</i> after school.

04:56.343 --> 05:01.264
But I'm sure I'll be done in time to pick
you up, say, 7-ish?

05:01.431 --> 05:04.017
You'll be late.
But if you actually show up this time...

05:04.184 --> 05:05.894
...I'll consider it a victory.

05:15.278 --> 05:18.156
No, no, no, and furthermore, no!

05:18.323 --> 05:23.078
But boss, Silvio "Silvermane" Manfredi
is getting out of prison this month.

05:23.245 --> 05:26.581
The auction's how he's taking his
criminal empire back from the Big Man!

05:26.748 --> 05:29.000
Foswell, you've got Silvermane
on the brain!

05:29.167 --> 05:31.962
I'm not risking another dime
on this crazy story.

05:33.129 --> 05:37.175
Guy wins a Pulitzer for his
Silvermane exposÃ© 12 years ago...

05:37.342 --> 05:40.512
...and all he's gotten since
is lazy.

05:45.976 --> 05:48.687
Mr. Foswell?
Couldn't help overhearing...

05:48.854 --> 05:50.480
...you know, at Jonah-volume.

05:50.647 --> 05:53.275
You wanted some photos
for your Silvermane-Big Man story?

05:53.859 --> 05:55.986
I'm not sure there is a story anymore.

05:56.653 --> 05:58.488
<i>I'm not sure there is one either.</i>

05:58.655 --> 06:00.824
<i>But if the Big Man's involved,
I want in.</i>

06:02.617 --> 06:05.579
Maybe pictures would change
the jolly one's mind.

06:13.670 --> 06:17.132
Hey, what gives?
I wanna bid for my boss.

06:17.299 --> 06:19.259
I think not. Your mystery employer...

06:19.426 --> 06:21.761
...withdrew all the money
from his bidding account.

06:21.928 --> 06:23.471
Beat it, small fry.

06:33.732 --> 06:37.569
<i>Hey, I know that guy.
Or Spidey does anyway.</i>

06:39.946 --> 06:42.115
Hey, Pete.
Thanks for meeting me.

06:42.282 --> 06:45.035
<i>Does everyone have
a secret identity?</i>

06:45.201 --> 06:47.621
I believe Mr. Kingsley's last bid
was 5O million.

06:47.787 --> 06:50.874
<i>- Fifty one million.
- Fifty two.</i>

06:51.041 --> 06:52.250
<i>Fifty five.</i>

06:53.501 --> 06:55.712
Patch planted a bug on Menken.

06:55.879 --> 07:00.133
That's great, Mr. Foswell.
But why do we care?

07:00.300 --> 07:02.552
Silvio Manfredi ran this town...

07:02.719 --> 07:05.430
...until the feds put him away
and the Big Man took over.

07:06.014 --> 07:08.141
But now that Silvermane's
getting out...

07:08.308 --> 07:10.644
...there'll be a gang war
for control of the city.

07:10.810 --> 07:13.730
Silvermane's old guard versus
the Big Man's status quo...

07:13.897 --> 07:17.484
...versus Doc Oak's new breed
of weirdos in costumes.

07:17.651 --> 07:20.487
- So, what are they all bidding on?
- The keys to the city.

07:20.654 --> 07:22.739
The specs to mass-produce an army...

07:22.906 --> 07:25.533
...of Rhino-armoured
super-mercenaries.

07:25.700 --> 07:27.953
<i>Starting to see why we care.</i>

07:31.247 --> 07:34.084
A hundred mil.
Top that, princess.

07:34.250 --> 07:36.920
- One twenty five.
- One fifty!

07:37.087 --> 07:39.089
Five hundred million.

07:39.255 --> 07:41.424
I have 500 million dollars bid.

07:41.591 --> 07:43.969
Going once, twice...

07:44.761 --> 07:48.014
Sold to Roderick Kingsley.

07:49.933 --> 07:52.644
Doesn't this Kingsley guy
own a perfume company?

07:52.811 --> 07:55.563
- How does he fit in?
- Don't know.

07:55.730 --> 07:57.857
<i>Mr. Kingsley, you may claim
the jump drive...</i>

07:58.024 --> 08:01.027
<i>...with the specs in one hour
at a Tribeca warehouse...</i>

08:01.194 --> 08:03.947
<i>...116 Hudson Street.</i>

08:04.114 --> 08:08.034
I should go now, score a prime-time
spot to snap some pics.

08:08.201 --> 08:09.828
Okay, kid. But keep your distance.

08:09.995 --> 08:13.081
I'm calling in the cops and don't want
you caught in the crossfire.

08:46.448 --> 08:48.825
Step out of the limo
with your hands up!

08:48.992 --> 08:50.118
<i>Well, that's a relief.</i>

08:50.285 --> 08:52.245
<i>Maybe I'll make my date
with Liz after all.</i>

08:53.997 --> 08:55.790
<i>Or not.</i>

09:53.556 --> 09:55.850
Sable Manfredi?

09:56.726 --> 09:58.770
Call me Silver Sable.

09:58.937 --> 10:02.148
Now, I believe you have
something for my father?

10:02.315 --> 10:05.276
We paid for this fair and...

10:32.303 --> 10:34.848
And all this time, I thought
they called you Hammerhead...

10:35.014 --> 10:37.559
-...because you had a thing for sharks.
- Steel plated.

10:55.577 --> 10:58.580
I said it before
and I'll say it again...

10:58.746 --> 11:01.708
...don't mess with the big dogs.

11:01.875 --> 11:05.420
- For me? You shouldn't have.
- I didn't.

11:05.587 --> 11:07.547
Some things never change.

11:17.640 --> 11:19.017
Get me out of here!

11:33.656 --> 11:36.367
Not me! The box!

11:37.952 --> 11:40.496
Although I'm tempted
to let you two take each other out--

11:40.663 --> 11:42.582
And don't get me started
on the entertainment value...

11:42.749 --> 11:44.667
...of a kick-line of Rhinos
at Radio City.

11:44.834 --> 11:47.795
--I'm thinking we keep this tech
under wraps.

11:56.304 --> 11:59.307
<i>At least Doc Ock
decided not to play.</i>

11:59.974 --> 12:04.229
Indeed, I thought
you'd want to know.

12:18.785 --> 12:22.914
- Still using the same dirty tricks?
- Oh, I have new ones too.

12:26.834 --> 12:29.254
You're good, princess.

12:29.420 --> 12:30.880
I had a good teacher.

12:33.800 --> 12:35.551
And that's why I broke up with you.

12:35.718 --> 12:38.471
I could never get anything
through your thick skull!

12:38.638 --> 12:41.683
The way my skull remembers it,
I dumped you!

12:41.849 --> 12:43.643
Whoa, whoa. You two dated?

12:45.186 --> 12:47.563
He keeps getting in the way.

12:47.730 --> 12:51.276
How about we partner up one last time
to delete him from the equation.

12:51.442 --> 12:54.028
Finally, something we can agree on.

12:55.655 --> 12:58.199
Whoa, Hammy,
what did you see in her?

12:58.366 --> 13:02.453
We had a lot in common.
Like hating spiders.

13:08.293 --> 13:11.879
So glad I could bring you
two kids together.

13:15.091 --> 13:16.676
- EmPtY?
- EmPtY!

13:23.141 --> 13:26.227
- Kingsley! He tricked us.
- He tricked you.

13:26.394 --> 13:28.771
Took the gizmo
and handed you an empty box.

13:46.956 --> 13:49.125
Sorry, gotta swing!

13:51.669 --> 13:53.629
And there goes my story.

14:07.226 --> 14:08.728
Bait and switch.

14:08.895 --> 14:12.774
Sometimes the classics
really are the best.

14:13.983 --> 14:16.486
- You!
- The one and only.

14:16.652 --> 14:20.281
And I plan on keeping it that way.

14:35.296 --> 14:37.590
Hate to horn in, but--

14:40.593 --> 14:42.261
Hey!

14:43.221 --> 14:45.807
I got the thing on the thing.
What do I win?

14:45.973 --> 14:49.435
- You.
- I win me? That makes no sense.

14:53.773 --> 14:54.816
I need the police.

14:56.025 --> 14:59.904
- New York will belong to Silvermane!
- To the Big Man!

15:00.405 --> 15:04.325
Good. Let them hug it out.
I've got bigger, uglier problems.

15:05.076 --> 15:06.786
This is gonna hurt.

15:37.817 --> 15:39.485
Sorry about your ride, Hamster...

15:39.652 --> 15:41.612
...but you shouldn't have
taken my drive.

15:46.325 --> 15:50.329
My drive.
I mean, the Big Man's drive.

15:51.289 --> 15:55.460
No one's drive.
No more Rhinos.

16:02.091 --> 16:04.552
Don't you just hate
being interrupted?

16:08.848 --> 16:12.477
So, needle-nose, just to be clear,
you want to destroy the specs too?

16:12.643 --> 16:15.271
Yeah. I don't need no competition.

16:16.147 --> 16:17.815
I know I'll regret this...

16:17.982 --> 16:20.693
...but do you want to partner up
to destroy it?

16:26.032 --> 16:31.162
Okay. But first,
we get them down here.

16:41.005 --> 16:42.131
Not big on subtle, huh?

16:58.689 --> 17:02.401
I want that drive.
Get the point?

17:02.568 --> 17:05.320
Look, if we're gonna work together,
you gotta get better material.

17:33.683 --> 17:36.185
- Wow, they really have issues.
- Yeah.

17:36.352 --> 17:39.313
- Wanna get in there?
- Hey, I'm a professional pest.

17:45.319 --> 17:46.654
Nice one, partner.

17:46.821 --> 17:49.949
Sorry, I'm dismembering
our partnership.

17:55.955 --> 17:58.416
What? No high fives?
No kumbayas?

17:58.583 --> 18:00.293
I'm shocked.
Shocked, I tell you!

18:02.420 --> 18:05.089
Daddy was so right to fire you.

18:05.256 --> 18:08.634
That's what I get for taking pity
on the boss's daughter.

18:44.587 --> 18:46.088
Missed again.

18:47.381 --> 18:50.009
Not aiming at you.

18:51.010 --> 18:54.263
Man, tell me I did not just fall
for a gag I once used on Shocker.

19:26.796 --> 19:28.756
Got the idea from Ms. Manfredi.

19:28.923 --> 19:32.343
Figured if it worked on me,
it would work on mindless over there.

19:32.510 --> 19:34.512
Good call. Thanks.

19:34.679 --> 19:37.890
Hey, never hurts to have
someone watch your back.

19:38.057 --> 19:42.144
Leastways,
that's what I tell my students.

19:45.272 --> 19:48.567
Those are some lucky students.

19:50.152 --> 19:52.822
I'm sorry, Mr. Kingsley.
We gave you the merchandise.

19:52.988 --> 19:54.824
Securing it was your concern.

19:54.990 --> 19:57.118
No refunds.

19:59.161 --> 20:00.204
Yes.

20:00.371 --> 20:02.707
Everything went exactly
as you planned.

20:02.873 --> 20:06.711
So no one knows you gave Kingsley
a fake drive in the first place?

20:06.877 --> 20:07.920
<i>No, sir.</i>

20:08.087 --> 20:10.715
<i>You have half a billion dollars
in an unmarked account...</i>

20:10.881 --> 20:12.133
<i>...to use as you see fit.</i>

20:12.299 --> 20:15.553
<i>Plus the original to re-sell later,
or use yourself.</i>

20:15.720 --> 20:17.555
Very good.

20:22.017 --> 20:25.062
Liz, I am so, so sorry.

20:25.229 --> 20:28.691
But I can show you pictures to prove
I was helping Mr. Foswell.

20:29.775 --> 20:30.943
I'm not mad.

20:31.110 --> 20:36.157
Okay, sure, it's too late to go out
but at least you showed this time.

20:37.283 --> 20:39.827
I kind of don't deserve you.

20:39.994 --> 20:42.538
You kind of don't.
But we'll work on that.

20:45.583 --> 20:48.461
<i>Wow, Gwen is so cool.</i>

20:48.627 --> 20:51.464
<i>I mean, Liz! Liz!</i>

20:53.340 --> 20:55.760
Enough with the gang war already!

20:55.926 --> 20:59.096
Auction this! Jump drive that!
No one cares!

20:59.263 --> 21:02.141
Police report says the web-head
teamed up with Rhino!

21:02.308 --> 21:06.103
- Rogue Spidey-- That's our lead story!
- They're the same story!

21:06.270 --> 21:07.730
Got your pictures, partner.

21:07.897 --> 21:09.732
Rhino and Spidey
fighting Hammerhead...

21:09.899 --> 21:12.151
...and Silver Sable
to destroy the jump drive...

21:12.318 --> 21:13.569
...and prevent a gang war!

21:14.612 --> 21:18.073
They were? They did?
Foswell, where's that story?

21:22.369 --> 21:25.456
What do you want, another Pulitzer?
I got breaking news to publish.

21:25.623 --> 21:28.417
Out! Out! Out!
