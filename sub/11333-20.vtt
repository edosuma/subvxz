00:00.918 --> 00:02.711
Previously on 90210:

00:02.753 --> 00:04.463
Dad?

00:04.505 --> 00:05.798
I'm thinking about opening up
a tackle shop

00:05.840 --> 00:08.592
down by the marina. Just need
a little seed money, is all.

00:08.634 --> 00:10.594
They're from my stepdad's
coin collection.

00:10.636 --> 00:11.720
Use the money to open

00:11.762 --> 00:12.930
the tackle shop and
get your own place.

00:12.972 --> 00:14.974
Tonight, we're stealing
the SATs.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.642
Dude, no, no.

00:16.684 --> 00:18.853
As of now, your life outside
of school is over.

00:18.894 --> 00:20.312
DEBBIE:
What is going on?

00:20.354 --> 00:21.522
All this bitterness,
all this sniping...

00:21.563 --> 00:23.565
Harry, I think that we
should go to counseling.

00:23.607 --> 00:25.734
What?
I kissed another
man, okay?

00:25.776 --> 00:26.861
I'm Teddy's girlfriend.

00:26.902 --> 00:27.820
Teddy has a girlfriend?

00:29.363 --> 00:30.238
So, are we okay?

00:30.280 --> 00:31.740
No.

00:31.782 --> 00:33.742
We're definitely not okay.

00:33.784 --> 00:35.828
You moved here?
You're back?

00:35.870 --> 00:37.329
Call me Karma, babe.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.707
And Karma is a bitch.

00:51.760 --> 00:52.887
Hey.

00:52.928 --> 00:54.763
What's wrong?

00:54.805 --> 00:56.431
(sighs)

00:56.473 --> 00:58.475
My life is over.

00:58.517 --> 00:59.727
I'm sure you did
fine on the SATs.

00:59.768 --> 01:02.646
Jen's back.

01:02.688 --> 01:04.565
She's back in LA?

01:08.402 --> 01:09.695
You know what?

01:09.737 --> 01:10.946
She's not our problem.

01:10.988 --> 01:12.489
Everything is
going to be okay.

01:12.531 --> 01:13.741
But it's not.

01:13.782 --> 01:15.158
She bought
the Beach Club.

01:15.200 --> 01:18.537
She's taken my Beach Club
away from me.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.205
So, we'll hang out
somewhere else.

01:20.247 --> 01:22.917
A man can only eat
so many Yucatán chicken wraps.

01:22.958 --> 01:24.459
No, but I love it there.

01:24.501 --> 01:27.337
They come around and mist me
while I'm tanning.

01:27.379 --> 01:28.463
(sighs)

01:28.505 --> 01:29.882
Jen's trying
to ruin my life again.

01:29.924 --> 01:30.966
Stay out of her way.
Don't engage.

01:31.008 --> 01:32.384
Don't go anywhere near her.

01:32.426 --> 01:34.177
But...
I'll mist you.

01:35.679 --> 01:37.765
You'll mist me?

01:37.806 --> 01:40.392
Sure. I'll mist you.

01:40.434 --> 01:41.476
Oh.

01:42.728 --> 01:45.022
Come on.

01:51.403 --> 01:53.280
Hey.

02:00.746 --> 02:01.914
Is that a, uh,
portrait of me?

02:01.956 --> 02:04.165
It's an abstract, Teddy.

02:04.207 --> 02:07.586
I-I'm sorry about what
happened with my dad.

02:07.628 --> 02:08.836
I really am.

02:08.878 --> 02:11.006
I was completely humiliated.

02:11.048 --> 02:13.425
I should have told
him about you,

02:13.467 --> 02:15.010
but the thing is,
my dad, he's...

02:15.052 --> 02:17.220
he's tricky.

02:17.262 --> 02:18.931
He's got a big personality,
and he can be

02:18.973 --> 02:20.181
kind of judgmental, and...

02:20.223 --> 02:21.558
And you don't think
he'll like me.

02:21.600 --> 02:24.144
No! No. I-I do.

02:24.185 --> 02:26.105
I mean, he will.
I really want him to like you.

02:26.187 --> 02:27.940
And this
is new to me.

02:27.982 --> 02:29.357
You know, I haven't done this.

02:29.399 --> 02:31.819
I've never known a girl
that mattered enough to me

02:31.860 --> 02:32.945
to introduce
to my father.

02:32.987 --> 02:35.697
And... I want to do it right.

02:37.491 --> 02:39.534
So...

02:39.576 --> 02:41.787
Come over and have dinner
with me and my dad?

02:41.829 --> 02:43.872
And break bread
with your kind-of-judgmental

02:43.914 --> 02:45.040
mega-movie-star dad?

02:48.752 --> 02:50.545
"Okay," she says,
immediately regretting it.

02:50.587 --> 02:52.047
"Thank you,"

02:52.089 --> 02:54.299
he says,
getting ready to kiss her.

02:55.926 --> 02:57.552
(both laughing)

02:57.594 --> 02:59.429
(chuckles)

03:01.932 --> 03:03.892
FINN:
Yeah. Three dimes.

03:03.934 --> 03:06.561
I was thinking
more like 18.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.647
But come on up.
Have a look

03:08.689 --> 03:10.524
for yourself.
We'll settle on something fair.

03:10.565 --> 03:11.817
Uh-huh.

03:11.859 --> 03:12.901
I'm staying at the, uh,

03:12.943 --> 03:14.486
Pacific Waves Motor Hotel.

03:14.528 --> 03:16.071
(chuckles)

03:16.113 --> 03:18.740
Every bit as luxurious
as it sounds.

03:18.782 --> 03:20.534
Yeah, two hours. Okay.

03:22.452 --> 03:23.996
So?

03:24.038 --> 03:27.499
So, my boy, we got a broker
in Redondo who thinks

03:27.541 --> 03:30.044
they may only be worth $15,000.

03:32.295 --> 03:36.091
This is-this is really
gonna happen, huh?

03:36.133 --> 03:38.093
The tackle shop and you
and me living together?

03:38.135 --> 03:39.219
Thanks to you.

03:39.260 --> 03:43.057
Dad, what do you say
we celebrate, hmm?

03:43.098 --> 03:44.725
Rent a boat or something.
Do some fishing.

03:44.766 --> 03:46.185
That sounds good.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.687
Yeah. Let me take care
of my business, and we'll...

03:48.729 --> 03:49.730
we'll hit the high seas.

03:49.771 --> 03:50.814
All right.
Oh!

03:58.113 --> 04:00.074
(upbeat music playing)

04:03.702 --> 04:05.746
(lowers volume)

04:05.787 --> 04:08.040
(cell phone rings)

04:08.082 --> 04:09.791
Is it okay if I make a call?

04:09.833 --> 04:11.710
That's cool, Grizz, take five
and then we'll get busy, okay?

04:11.752 --> 04:14.462
All right. Thanks.

04:14.504 --> 04:15.714
Hi.

04:15.756 --> 04:17.173
Take five?

04:17.216 --> 04:18.926
That's, like, actual
recording studio talk.

04:18.966 --> 04:20.219
(both laugh)

04:20.260 --> 04:21.887
I am so excited.

04:21.928 --> 04:24.932
Well, I'm excited
you're excited, sweetie.

04:24.973 --> 04:26.100
Mmm.

04:26.141 --> 04:27.768
Speaking of exciting...
Mm-hmm?

04:27.809 --> 04:29.228
What would you think

04:29.269 --> 04:31.688
about maybe recording
a duet with Javier?

04:31.730 --> 04:33.732
It was the label's
idea, but I...
Javier?

04:33.774 --> 04:36.568
As in, um...

04:36.610 --> 04:38.862
Javier-Javier?

04:38.904 --> 04:40.822
Javier-Javier-Javier.

04:40.864 --> 04:41.990
(laughing)

04:42.032 --> 04:43.825
Okay, that's insane.

04:43.867 --> 04:45.744
I am, like,
his biggest fan ever.

04:45.786 --> 04:46.912
I have his
Christmas album.

04:46.954 --> 04:47.829
I have his
kids' album.

04:47.871 --> 04:48.997
(both chuckle)

04:49.039 --> 04:50.916
Anyway, slight snag.
Mm-hmm?

04:50.958 --> 04:52.042
Javier's about ready
to go out on tour,

04:52.084 --> 04:53.293
so this needs to happen fast.

04:53.334 --> 04:55.254
I can be anywhere, anytime.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.005
Scheduling? Not the snag.

04:57.047 --> 04:59.133
Check this out.

Right?

05:18.735 --> 05:20.028
Oh...

05:20.070 --> 05:21.071
I'm out to four
different writers,

05:21.113 --> 05:22.823
praying for something better.

05:22.864 --> 05:24.783
I could write it.

05:24.825 --> 05:27.661
I mean, I'd like to try.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.206
Why not?

05:31.248 --> 05:33.167
I mean, if you have
something ready

05:33.208 --> 05:34.209
by Wednesday,
we'll listen to it.

05:34.251 --> 05:36.837
Okay. Yeah. Cool.

05:46.345 --> 05:48.223
(line ringing)

05:48.265 --> 05:49.808
MAN (on phone):
Yup. Pacific Waves.

05:49.850 --> 05:52.144
Uh, yeah. Hi.
Finn Court, please.

05:52.186 --> 05:53.687
Not here.

05:53.728 --> 05:56.148
Excuse me?

05:56.190 --> 05:58.441
Checked out about an hour ago.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.536
(music playing on radio)

06:09.577 --> 06:10.787
Hey!

06:10.829 --> 06:12.664
(music stops)
Hey!

06:12.706 --> 06:14.249
Excuse me.

06:14.291 --> 06:15.959
What are you doing?

06:16.001 --> 06:17.752
Why are you waving your tape
measure in front of my house?

06:17.794 --> 06:19.129
Uh, my house.

06:19.171 --> 06:20.922
Norman, I think we need to
take a look at the gutters

06:20.964 --> 06:23.842
on the other side.

06:23.884 --> 06:26.011
Well, I pouted a little
and Olivier bought it for me.

06:26.053 --> 06:27.846
Well, for weekends.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.681
A sort of country house.

06:29.723 --> 06:30.891
You can't do this.

06:30.932 --> 06:32.100
I already have.

06:32.142 --> 06:33.810
I live here, Jen.

06:33.852 --> 06:36.938
For 29 more days,
as stipulated by California law.

06:36.980 --> 06:39.398
But if the construction
is going to bother you,

06:39.440 --> 06:41.609
feel free to vacate sooner.

07:17.187 --> 07:20.065
(line ringing)

07:20.107 --> 07:22.067
Oh, my God. You must have ESP.

07:22.109 --> 07:23.443
I was just about to call you.
I have to talk to you.

07:23.484 --> 07:25.946
Yeah, I need
to talk to you, too.

07:25.987 --> 07:27.739
Some pretty messed up stuff
just went down with my dad.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.074
Well, did he evict you?

07:29.116 --> 07:31.368
Did he give you 29 days
to get out?

07:31.410 --> 07:33.412
Jen just bought my house, Liam.
The one I live in.

07:33.453 --> 07:34.913
What?

07:34.955 --> 07:36.539
Now I'm going to kill her.
I-I'm going to.

07:36.581 --> 07:38.166
No. No. You can't
engage with her, Naomi.

07:38.208 --> 07:39.418
She's like a rattlesnake.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.253
You can't go poking her
with a stick.

07:41.295 --> 07:42.337
You'll find a new place to live.

07:42.379 --> 07:44.589
Oh, really? Really? How?

07:44.631 --> 07:46.425
I don't know.
We'll find you something.

07:46.466 --> 07:49.177
Just promise me that you'll
stay away from her. Okay?

07:49.219 --> 07:50.720
She's toxic.

07:50.762 --> 07:52.431
Okay.

07:52.472 --> 07:55.183
So, I gave my dad these coins,
right? And...

07:55.225 --> 07:56.184
I'm gonna go,

07:56.226 --> 07:57.477
eat some ice cream,

07:57.518 --> 07:58.770
calm myself down.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.314
I'll call you back, babe.

08:07.070 --> 08:08.780
NAVID:
What? Javier Luna?

08:08.822 --> 08:10.157
That's seriously amazing.

08:10.198 --> 08:11.241
I know. Double amazing?
Get this.

08:11.283 --> 08:12.492
Laurel, my producer?
Yeah?

08:12.533 --> 08:14.119
She's letting me try
to write the song.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.912
What?
(laughs)

08:15.954 --> 08:17.998
I could be
"singer-songwriter."

08:18.039 --> 08:19.207
Wow, I am so
proud of you.

08:19.249 --> 08:21.501
Come here. Oh, I've got
to go to the Blaze.

08:21.542 --> 08:22.794
Uh, we'll talk more.
I'll see you later?

08:22.836 --> 08:23.711
Yeah. See you.

08:23.753 --> 08:25.964
Bye.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.132
Well, well, well.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.300
The plot thickens.

08:28.342 --> 08:30.385
What is that
supposed to mean?

08:30.427 --> 08:33.138
Why are you wiggling
your eyebrows?

08:33.179 --> 08:35.265
He's my friend.

08:35.307 --> 08:37.058
He just got
a girlfriend.

08:37.100 --> 08:38.434
Okay, don't kill me.

08:38.477 --> 08:39.977
Do you wish he didn't?

08:40.020 --> 08:41.520
Okay, look.

08:41.562 --> 08:46.318
Navid will always be
very special to me.

08:46.360 --> 08:47.402
But he's with Lila
now and he's happy.

08:47.444 --> 08:49.946
So I respect that.

08:49.988 --> 08:51.572
And he totally
deserves to be happy

08:51.614 --> 08:53.367
after everything I
put him through, so...

08:53.408 --> 08:55.285
Okay. Just had to ask.

08:55.327 --> 08:56.577
Okay, I got
a question for you.

08:56.619 --> 08:58.288
Is it an eyebrow-wiggling
type question?

08:58.330 --> 09:00.415
Nope. What's Teddy's dad like?

09:00.457 --> 09:02.083
I have to go over there
tomorrow night for dinner,

09:02.125 --> 09:04.085
and I just want to know
what I'm in for.

09:04.127 --> 09:05.337
Whoa. You're meeting Spence?

09:05.379 --> 09:07.255
Why do you say it like that?
Is he scary?

09:07.297 --> 09:09.257
He's just really intense.

09:09.299 --> 09:11.426
He either loves people
or hates people.

09:11.468 --> 09:13.803
And when he hates people,
oh, boy.

09:15.180 --> 09:16.931
Wait, are you nervous?

09:16.973 --> 09:19.476
Uh, now I am.

09:22.270 --> 09:25.106
DIXON: I think I almost died
in Mr. Cline's class.

09:25.148 --> 09:26.900
Hold on. Hey.
What's up?

09:26.941 --> 09:28.193
Not much.

09:28.235 --> 09:32.030
Uh, are you pissed at me?

09:32.072 --> 09:33.948
No, Dix, I'm not pissed
at you, okay?

09:33.990 --> 09:35.534
I'm just...

09:35.575 --> 09:37.869
I'm just not really into this
whole getting blown off thing.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.496
But I'm not.
I'm not blowing you off.

09:39.538 --> 09:41.873
I just really appreciate
direct communication.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.041
Okay? So...

09:43.083 --> 09:45.335
if you don't like me,
or you don't like blondes,

09:45.377 --> 09:46.878
or you don't like the
way I chew, or whatever...

09:46.920 --> 09:48.213
Ivy, stop.

09:48.255 --> 09:49.381
You're getting the wrong idea.

09:51.216 --> 09:53.427
All I want to do
is hang out with you,

09:53.468 --> 09:56.137
but you know I'm grounded.
So...

09:56.179 --> 09:58.306
call me when you
can, I guess.

09:58.348 --> 09:59.974
Wait.
What?

10:02.185 --> 10:04.229
That doesn't mean that you
can't come to my house, right?

10:06.189 --> 10:07.190
I mean, am I allowed to?

10:07.232 --> 10:09.067
I don't know.

10:09.109 --> 10:12.153
But, uh, what I do know is my
parents are going out tonight.

10:12.195 --> 10:14.197
And, uh...

10:14.239 --> 10:16.908
I can't wait any longer
to hang out with you.

10:20.370 --> 10:21.496
All right.

10:21.538 --> 10:22.997
All right?

10:23.039 --> 10:24.040
Yeah, all right.

10:24.082 --> 10:25.459
(laughs)
All right.

10:25.500 --> 10:27.377
(both chuckling)

10:34.259 --> 10:37.178
No more wraps
or mozzarella sticks.

10:37.220 --> 10:38.472
I want to class
this place up, Tio.

10:38.513 --> 10:40.432
¿Comprende?
I want more...

10:40.474 --> 10:42.058
European flair.

10:42.100 --> 10:46.187
Oh, how does a coq au vin
chopped salad grab you?

10:46.229 --> 10:48.482
Good. We have
a good selection now...

10:48.523 --> 10:51.067
Oh, hold that
thought, Tio.

10:51.109 --> 10:52.277
Uh, you know what?
To be continued.

10:56.239 --> 10:57.532
What do you want?

10:57.574 --> 10:59.367
Other than world peace?

10:59.409 --> 11:00.952
Oh, my God.

11:00.994 --> 11:03.037
(clears throat, sighs)

11:05.290 --> 11:07.375
You can have any house
in Beverly Hills,

11:07.417 --> 11:09.419
and you had to have mine.

11:09.461 --> 11:10.962
Something doesn't smell right.

11:11.004 --> 11:12.713
Well...

11:12.755 --> 11:15.049
I think that's probably
Tio's aftershave.

11:15.091 --> 11:17.051
You want something, Jen.

11:17.093 --> 11:19.513
(sighs):
Yes, as a matter of fact,

11:19.554 --> 11:21.806
I do want something.

11:21.848 --> 11:24.309
Look, while I was in France,
Olivier and I, we...

11:24.351 --> 11:26.186
we fell back in love.

11:26.227 --> 11:28.229
It took time, but...

11:28.271 --> 11:30.482
I knew I had to forgive
him for his indiscretions

11:30.524 --> 11:32.984
and learn to
trust him again.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.152
(sighs)

11:34.194 --> 11:36.363
And we are more
in love than ever.

11:36.404 --> 11:37.696
(groans)
Waiter, barf bag.

11:37.738 --> 11:39.115
Which is why I can't

11:39.157 --> 11:41.117
allow you to tell him
what happened last year.

11:41.159 --> 11:43.620
He could never
handle the thought of
me with another man.

11:43.662 --> 11:45.497
He's very jealous.
(laughs):
Oh, you don't want me

11:45.539 --> 11:47.582
to tell him what
a big tramp you are?

11:47.624 --> 11:48.833
Exactly.

11:50.460 --> 11:52.337
(exhales)

11:52.379 --> 11:54.255
You know what?

11:54.297 --> 11:55.923
Do whatever you want?

11:57.342 --> 12:00.345
I owe you a very big apology.

12:00.387 --> 12:02.263
I have done some
terrible things

12:02.305 --> 12:04.391
to you.

12:04.432 --> 12:07.101
And I am really
truly very sorry.

12:07.143 --> 12:10.104
You can have the house.

12:10.146 --> 12:11.565
I'll give it to you.

12:11.606 --> 12:14.192
But what I would
really like...

12:14.234 --> 12:16.611
is another chance with you.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.614
Really?

12:19.656 --> 12:22.492
You're the only sister I've got.

12:25.203 --> 12:27.038
Please give me another chance.

12:27.080 --> 12:29.666
And I would love for you
to get to know Olivier.

12:29.708 --> 12:31.626
Join us for dinner
tomorrow night.

12:31.668 --> 12:33.253
Please.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.513
Guess who?

12:43.555 --> 12:45.014
(fake gasp)
Hillary Clinton?

12:45.056 --> 12:46.307
Close.

12:46.349 --> 12:48.142
Uh... Tila Tequila?

12:48.184 --> 12:49.394
Mm, closer.

12:49.436 --> 12:50.645
Ooh, Lila, is that you?

12:50.687 --> 12:51.646
Hi.

12:51.688 --> 12:52.689
Hey.

12:52.731 --> 12:53.732
Mwah.

12:53.772 --> 12:55.149
All right...
(clears throat)

12:55.191 --> 12:56.735
so, I have a story idea.

12:56.775 --> 12:58.361
Everyone's talking
about Adrianna and Javier.

12:58.403 --> 12:59.571
We should do a piece.

12:59.613 --> 13:02.532
Well, I thought you were, um,

13:02.574 --> 13:03.658
sensitive about the Ade thing.

13:03.700 --> 13:05.868
(sighs)
I was. I mean,

13:05.910 --> 13:08.162
my chest basically turned
to concrete at the mention

13:08.204 --> 13:10.582
of her name.
I don't know.

13:10.624 --> 13:12.709
Maybe it's 'cause we've
been hanging out so much,

13:12.751 --> 13:14.753
or maybe it's 'cause
we've gotten closer.

13:14.793 --> 13:17.589
But recently, no concrete.

13:17.631 --> 13:19.382
That's cool.
That is cool.

13:20.550 --> 13:22.427
(loud rock music playing)

13:26.723 --> 13:28.266
(knocking)

13:33.854 --> 13:36.149
Hey.

13:36.190 --> 13:37.567
Hey! Sorry.

13:37.609 --> 13:39.444
I, uh, tried knocking, but...

13:39.486 --> 13:41.154
(loud music continues playing)

13:41.195 --> 13:42.697
Hey, Liam!

13:42.739 --> 13:44.282
(chuckles)

13:44.324 --> 13:46.367
(turns off music)
Hello? I'm not doing

13:46.409 --> 13:47.577
this Matthews' project
by myself.

13:47.619 --> 13:48.662
I barely know

13:48.703 --> 13:50.455
who Vivaldi is.
I mean...

13:52.499 --> 13:54.125
(pants)
Are you okay?

13:56.210 --> 13:57.671
(exhales)

13:57.712 --> 14:00.214
Uh... where did you
get the boat?

14:00.256 --> 14:01.633
I built it.

14:01.675 --> 14:03.802
You built a boat?

14:03.842 --> 14:06.513
That's what I do when I want
to blow off some steam, okay?

14:06.554 --> 14:08.515
Okay.

14:12.101 --> 14:13.436
So...

14:13.478 --> 14:15.188
uh...

14:15.229 --> 14:16.731
what got you
all steamed up?

14:16.773 --> 14:19.317
You can talk to me.

14:19.359 --> 14:21.569
I mean, come on,
you were there

14:21.611 --> 14:23.488
when I found out
my parents

14:23.530 --> 14:25.239
were all messed up,
so you can

14:25.281 --> 14:26.073
definitely trust me.

14:29.910 --> 14:32.497
(exhales)

14:32.539 --> 14:36.417
My dad meant a lot to me
when I was a kid.

14:36.459 --> 14:39.170
And, um, we were,
like, really close,

14:39.212 --> 14:41.506
and we went sailing, you know?

14:41.548 --> 14:43.800
Sailing was
our thing.

14:43.842 --> 14:46.678
Anyway, he hasn't been
around for a while,

14:46.720 --> 14:48.805
and just recently...

14:48.847 --> 14:52.726
out of the blue,
he showed up, and...

14:52.767 --> 14:55.353
like an idiot,
I got all excited

14:55.395 --> 14:58.022
thinking he was
gonna stay.

14:58.064 --> 15:01.609
As soon as he got what
he wanted, he took off.

15:01.651 --> 15:05.279
And, uh...

15:05.321 --> 15:07.281
Just whatever, so...

15:09.576 --> 15:11.870
Hey, I haven't
really told anybody

15:11.911 --> 15:14.205
about my dad, so if you...

15:14.247 --> 15:15.206
What about Naomi?

15:15.248 --> 15:17.291
Yeah,

15:17.333 --> 15:20.002
well... no.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.339
Well, you should tell her.

15:23.381 --> 15:26.092
I mean, she is
your girlfriend.

15:28.219 --> 15:29.345
Yeah.

15:36.686 --> 15:37.978
Jack, neat,

15:38.020 --> 15:40.607
and, uh, let me have one
of those local beers

15:40.648 --> 15:41.816
you're always touting.

15:41.858 --> 15:43.943
Yeah. Just
a ginger ale for me.

15:43.984 --> 15:47.071
Ooh.
Come on, I'm getting
a little old

15:47.113 --> 15:49.031
for vomiting and hangovers,
don't you think?

15:49.073 --> 15:51.576
No. You're never too old
for vomiting and hangovers.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.494
Says you.
(laughs)

15:53.536 --> 15:56.414
(phone rings)

15:56.456 --> 15:58.541
Thanks.
Ugh. It's a
work thing.

15:58.583 --> 16:01.210
Cross your fingers they're not
dragging me back to the studio.

16:02.378 --> 16:03.463
Yeah?

16:04.756 --> 16:05.965
(chuckles quietly)

16:12.388 --> 16:13.514
Ryan?

16:17.560 --> 16:19.562
Jen.

16:19.604 --> 16:21.188
Hi.
Hello, darling.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.693
OLIVIER:
Can I say two words to you?

16:25.735 --> 16:26.778
Signature umbrellas.

16:26.820 --> 16:28.362
That's what this place needs.

16:28.404 --> 16:29.739
JEN (laughs):
That's a good idea.

16:29.781 --> 16:31.991
Um, this is
Ryan Matthews,

16:32.032 --> 16:34.285
uh, Naomi's teacher.

16:34.327 --> 16:35.703
Ryan, this is Olivier,
my husband.

16:35.745 --> 16:37.747
OLIVIER:
Uh-huh. An educator.

16:37.789 --> 16:38.957
It's a pleasure to meet you.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.792
Uh, drinks on the house.

16:40.834 --> 16:42.460
Oh, that's okay.
It's no skin
off my face.

16:42.502 --> 16:43.544
You know, we own the Beach Club.

16:43.586 --> 16:45.630
Uh... wow.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.381
Th-that's a great thing

16:47.423 --> 16:48.758
to own.

16:48.800 --> 16:50.426
It's not the Dodgers, but...

16:50.468 --> 16:51.886
JEN:
Um, darling, we should

16:51.928 --> 16:53.805
get to our table.
(speaks French)

16:53.847 --> 16:56.307
Ryan, it was
lovely to see you.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.058
Indeed, it was.
Great meeting you.

16:59.393 --> 17:00.311
Pleasure was mine.

17:06.693 --> 17:10.029
Can I get a little whiskey
in the, uh, ginger ale?

17:12.740 --> 17:14.617
Make it a double.

17:19.622 --> 17:20.915
Whoa, hey,

17:20.957 --> 17:23.751
watch the, uh,
carbon footprint.

17:23.792 --> 17:25.837
I can't write.
I can't.

17:25.878 --> 17:28.631
I have lost my ability
to string words together.

17:28.673 --> 17:30.633
This was it,
this was my big chance,

17:30.675 --> 17:31.843
and I'm totally
blowing it.

17:31.885 --> 17:33.427
Nah, you've written
songs before.

17:33.469 --> 17:34.888
Yeah, but not like this.

17:34.929 --> 17:36.055
I don't know what's happening.

17:36.096 --> 17:37.640
Everything I write is terrible.

17:37.682 --> 17:38.725
And the more I write,

17:38.766 --> 17:40.768
the terribler it gets.

17:40.810 --> 17:41.769
"Terribler."
Listen to me.

17:41.811 --> 17:43.479
I totally can't even talk.

17:43.521 --> 17:45.023
No, let me see.

17:45.105 --> 17:47.859
You're probably just
being hard on yourself.

17:47.901 --> 17:48.943
(exhales)

17:55.825 --> 17:57.869
Oh, my God, I'm ruined.

17:57.911 --> 17:58.953
No, you're not.
Just, uh, just,

17:58.995 --> 18:00.997
you got to get out of your head.

18:01.039 --> 18:02.707
And how do I do that,
by banging it against the wall?

18:02.749 --> 18:03.791
'Cause I already tried that.

18:03.833 --> 18:07.211
I'll figure something out.

18:11.007 --> 18:12.800
TEDDY:
I'm sorry. It was supposed

18:12.842 --> 18:15.678
to be just us, but my dad
invited a few friends.

18:15.720 --> 18:17.889
Oh, okay.
My half-sister Kate
might be here.

18:17.931 --> 18:19.390
You'd like Kate.
She's really nice.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.017
Like, obsessed with horses,
but really nice.

18:21.059 --> 18:22.685
Yeah?
SPENCE:
Arthur, please,

18:22.727 --> 18:23.978
if you keep asking me questions
about this contract,

18:24.020 --> 18:26.355
I'm gonna throw you up here
on the grill.

18:26.397 --> 18:28.900
Have it your way, but
if the deal doesn't close,
don't call me crying.

18:28.942 --> 18:30.693
No, I'll call you screaming.
Whatever.

18:30.735 --> 18:32.946
Yeah, well...
Hey, Dad,
you remember...

18:32.987 --> 18:35.073
Hey, listen, and don't bill me
for this hour, either, Arthur.
Yeah, yeah.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.491
Hey, Dad, this is Silver
from the match.

18:37.533 --> 18:38.659
Hi, Silver.

18:38.701 --> 18:40.244
What an
unusual name.

18:40.286 --> 18:42.747
Oh, actually, it's, um...
I hope you're hungry.

18:42.789 --> 18:43.998
Take a look at
this piece of meat.

18:44.040 --> 18:44.958
Is this not
gorgeous?

18:44.999 --> 18:46.751
Come on. Peter Luger.

18:46.793 --> 18:48.127
Whoo.
(laughs)

18:48.168 --> 18:50.129
Uh, actually,
Silver's a vegetarian.

18:50.170 --> 18:52.090
Does she eat chicken?

18:52.131 --> 18:55.426
Uh, n-no, not... not so much.
No?

18:55.468 --> 18:56.844
Well, let's see,
maybe I've got

18:56.886 --> 18:58.679
a veggie burger
with your name on it.

18:58.721 --> 19:00.848
Ah, Silver.
Put it right there.

19:00.890 --> 19:02.558
Perfect.
So, Teddy says

19:02.600 --> 19:03.601
you don't play tennis.

19:03.643 --> 19:06.562
Oh, um, no, sadly I don't.

19:06.604 --> 19:08.606
Um, but I-I...

19:08.648 --> 19:10.357
Silver's really
into the Blaze.

19:10.399 --> 19:12.568
What-what is that?
Is that a junior arsonist club?

19:12.610 --> 19:13.694
SILVER:
No, it's, uh,

19:13.736 --> 19:15.071
it's like a magazine.

19:15.113 --> 19:17.115
I mean, it's like a, um,
it's like a newspaper,

19:17.156 --> 19:19.575
but actually,
it's more of a news...

19:19.617 --> 19:20.827
Silver's a journalist.

19:20.868 --> 19:22.120
Yeah? Well,
in my field,

19:22.161 --> 19:23.788
I've met hundreds
of journalists,

19:23.830 --> 19:25.832
and I never
liked one of them.

19:25.873 --> 19:26.791
(chuckles)

19:33.131 --> 19:34.882
(laughing)

19:39.137 --> 19:40.847
Dr. Fun to the rescue!

19:40.888 --> 19:42.140
I don't see how
playing Skee-Ball

19:42.181 --> 19:43.891
is gonna get
this song written.

19:43.933 --> 19:45.101
Trust me, if you
aren't inspired

19:45.143 --> 19:47.311
and out of your
head in one hour,

19:47.353 --> 19:49.480
I will release you
from my clutches. Deal?

19:49.522 --> 19:50.815
Deal.
All right.

19:50.857 --> 19:51.983
Um, Dr. Fun?

19:52.025 --> 19:53.609
See that homeless man

19:53.651 --> 19:54.652
in the white shirt?
Yeah.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.154
I think that's
Mr. Matthews.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.155
No.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.990
Uh, yeah.

19:59.032 --> 20:01.200
Uh... Mr. Matthews?

20:01.241 --> 20:03.911
Oh, hey, uh...
(hiccups)

20:03.953 --> 20:05.830
I got into a
little tussle

20:05.872 --> 20:07.874
with this chili dog,
and I have to admit
defeat, 'cause just...

20:07.915 --> 20:10.209
look at it.
(chuckles)

20:10.250 --> 20:12.837
It's a worthy adversary.
Uh...

20:12.879 --> 20:14.463
hey, Mr. Matthews, are you cool?

20:14.505 --> 20:16.507
Yeah.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.009
Why, don't I look cool...

20:18.051 --> 20:20.178
hanging on to
the trash can.

20:20.219 --> 20:22.847
Are you sure
you're okay, Mr. Matthews?

20:22.889 --> 20:25.099
Guys, please.
This "Mr. Matthews,"

20:25.141 --> 20:27.351
it's so formal,
you know?

20:27.393 --> 20:30.021
When we're outside of school,
try... try something

20:30.063 --> 20:33.191
like "Mr. Ryan...
Matthews."

20:33.232 --> 20:34.942
Well, I'm gonna
hit the road.

20:34.984 --> 20:37.111
Papers to grade.

20:37.153 --> 20:39.030
You're both
getting A's.

20:40.156 --> 20:41.741
(quietly):
All right.

20:41.782 --> 20:43.034
Uh, wait, are you,

20:43.076 --> 20:45.078
uh, are you
calling a taxi?
Taxi.

20:45.119 --> 20:47.538
Taxi Driver.

20:47.580 --> 20:48.873
Great movie!

20:48.915 --> 20:50.416
(whispers inaudibly)

20:50.457 --> 20:52.043
(like De Niro):
You talkin' to me?
Huh?

20:52.085 --> 20:53.086
ADRIANNA:
What?

20:53.127 --> 20:54.128
You talkin' to me?

20:54.170 --> 20:55.546
No.

20:55.588 --> 20:56.714
You know, from the thing.

20:56.756 --> 20:57.798
The movie.

20:57.840 --> 20:58.841
Right.

21:14.857 --> 21:16.692
So, are you having
an okay time?
Yeah.

21:16.734 --> 21:18.819
I'm sorry I'm so tongue-tied--
I feel like I'm making

21:18.861 --> 21:20.071
a horrible first
impression.
No, no.

21:20.113 --> 21:20.905
You're doing great.
Yeah?

21:20.947 --> 21:22.949
Yeah.
Hey, Teddy.

21:22.990 --> 21:24.242
Oh, hey.
Sorry
I'm late.

21:24.283 --> 21:27.036
Hey, you're, uh,
the horse lover.

21:27.078 --> 21:28.996
It's Kate, right?
Teddy's sister?

21:29.038 --> 21:32.166
Uh... actually, Heidi here
is my dad's girlfriend.

21:34.043 --> 21:36.129
HEIDI:
Yeah, we met on set.

21:36.170 --> 21:38.631
That's right, and in
a very good movie, too.

21:38.672 --> 21:39.882
Into Arabia.

21:39.924 --> 21:40.925
Did you ever see that film,

21:40.967 --> 21:41.926
Silver?

21:41.968 --> 21:43.094
Uh, yes, I did.

21:43.136 --> 21:44.971
Great film, no?
Great film.

21:45.012 --> 21:45.888
Great film.

21:45.930 --> 21:47.974
(chuckles)

21:48.015 --> 21:49.142
You didn't like it.

21:49.183 --> 21:50.768
No. No, no.

21:50.810 --> 21:53.312
I mean, it's kind of just
a diff... erent...

21:53.353 --> 21:54.772
Hmm?

21:54.814 --> 21:56.732
Actually, no,
I didn't like it.

21:56.774 --> 21:59.610
It employed a bunch
of played-out,

21:59.652 --> 22:01.112
fear-mongering
stereotypes of
Arab people.

22:01.154 --> 22:03.239
The female characters,

22:03.281 --> 22:04.740
they were offensively
sexist and idiotic,

22:04.782 --> 22:06.909
and, I mean, frankly, it was
a waste of your talent.

22:11.747 --> 22:13.958
Well, to tell you the truth...

22:14.000 --> 22:15.417
I don't think you're wrong.

22:15.459 --> 22:17.253
That woman, that
astrophysicist character...

22:17.295 --> 22:19.421
By the way what was
she doing in Lebanon?

22:19.463 --> 22:21.882
I don't remember.
Rocking her gold lamé
bikini as I recall.

22:21.924 --> 22:23.009
(laughter)
Exactly.

22:23.050 --> 22:24.177
That's exactly right.

22:24.218 --> 22:25.261
Funny girl.

22:36.189 --> 22:37.731
ADRIANNA:
Get me off this ride

22:37.773 --> 22:41.401
before I get all Mr. Ryan
Matthews on that trash can.

22:41.443 --> 22:43.361
Yeah, funnel cake
wasn't the wisest move.

22:43.403 --> 22:46.824
No. (groans)

22:46.866 --> 22:47.992
No, we should go.

22:48.034 --> 22:49.952
No.

22:49.994 --> 22:51.829
No, this was
really nice of you,

22:51.871 --> 22:52.913
but honestly,
it's pointless.

22:52.955 --> 22:54.748
I'm so stupid

22:54.790 --> 22:56.292
for thinking I could actually
write a real song.

22:56.334 --> 22:58.376
No, hey, will you
just cut it out?

22:58.418 --> 22:59.753
I'm not gonna
listen to you

22:59.795 --> 23:00.963
beat yourself up
about this.

23:01.005 --> 23:01.964
Now I have three minutes,

23:02.006 --> 23:03.132
and I say we hit
the bumper cars.

23:03.174 --> 23:04.967
No. No, bumper
cars, okay?

23:05.009 --> 23:06.844
Just let it go, please?

23:06.886 --> 23:08.179
No.
What? Why?

23:08.221 --> 23:10.181
Because, Ade...

23:10.223 --> 23:11.891
you can do this.

23:13.059 --> 23:15.061
I know you can.

23:15.102 --> 23:17.395
I believe in you.

23:17.437 --> 23:19.982
I see you like this,
all depressed

23:20.024 --> 23:21.734
and down on yourself,

23:21.775 --> 23:24.402
it hurts.

23:24.444 --> 23:27.865
It's like the worst feeling
in the world.

23:27.907 --> 23:30.159
Seeing you happy,

23:30.201 --> 23:32.745
that means everything to me.

23:38.042 --> 23:39.835
(phone rings)
Navid...

23:39.877 --> 23:42.880
Aw...
Um...

23:42.922 --> 23:44.924
I gotta take this.

23:44.965 --> 23:46.342
Yeah.
Okay.

23:48.010 --> 23:50.428
Lila, hey.
(chuckles)

23:50.470 --> 23:53.182
No, I-I had a lot of work
at the Blaze,

23:53.224 --> 23:55.393
so I'm just hanging out
at the pier.

23:55.433 --> 23:57.853
Okay, I'll meet you
at the Beach Club.

24:00.522 --> 24:03.317
(sighs)

24:03.359 --> 24:04.818
Sorry about that.

24:04.860 --> 24:05.861
It's fine.

24:05.903 --> 24:07.238
So, where were we?

24:07.280 --> 24:08.781
Leaving.

24:08.822 --> 24:10.324
(chuckles)

24:10.366 --> 24:12.410
Your plan actually worked,
Dr. Fun.

24:12.450 --> 24:14.703
I'm inspired. I really want
to go home and write.

24:16.372 --> 24:19.708
Let's hit the road.

24:19.750 --> 24:22.544
Okay.

24:22.586 --> 24:26.382
GIRL:
That looks like so much fun!
Let's go! Whoo!

24:26.424 --> 24:29.051
Oh, wait, should we get
some dessert?

24:29.093 --> 24:32.012
Mmm, I don't know.

24:32.054 --> 24:37.268
Oh, are you trying
to prolong dinner?

24:37.310 --> 24:41.897
Sadly, I do not see your
sister coming, Jennifer.

24:41.939 --> 24:43.316
No, no, she'll be here.

24:43.357 --> 24:45.067
She's just late.

24:45.109 --> 24:47.194
Trust me, I know my sister,

24:47.236 --> 24:50.488
and I know she'll come.

24:50.530 --> 24:52.450
Well, I could try
the mango sorbet.

24:52.490 --> 24:54.785
Okay.

24:54.827 --> 24:56.454
Oh, here she is.

24:56.494 --> 24:59.206
Ah, you must be Naomi.
I am Olivier,

24:59.248 --> 25:00.958
your brother.
Oh, please,
don't kiss me.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.251
And sit back down.

25:02.293 --> 25:04.878
I'm not gonna be
here that long.

25:04.920 --> 25:06.422
I think there are
a few things

25:06.464 --> 25:07.881
you deserve to know
about my sister.

25:09.549 --> 25:11.218
I'm sure Jen
probably told you

25:11.260 --> 25:12.970
she spent last year
pining for you,

25:13.012 --> 25:14.596
but the truth is

25:14.638 --> 25:17.266
she was pretty much slutting
it up with any semi-rich guy

25:17.308 --> 25:18.767
who would look halfway
in her general direction.

25:18.809 --> 25:19.517
Naomi!

25:19.559 --> 25:20.311
What?

25:20.353 --> 25:22.104
Oh, yeah, and you might

25:22.146 --> 25:24.023
find this interesting:
she also slept

25:24.064 --> 25:25.316
with my boyfriend.

25:25.358 --> 25:26.608
He was, what, 16 at the time?

25:28.277 --> 25:30.863
Is... (clears throat)
is this true?

25:30.904 --> 25:32.365
(stammers)

25:32.406 --> 25:34.950
No, of course it's not true.

25:39.997 --> 25:41.165
You disgust me.

25:41.207 --> 25:42.791
No, Olivier!
No!

25:44.043 --> 25:45.878
C'est fini.

25:45.919 --> 25:49.256
Au revoir.

25:49.298 --> 25:51.008
As they say in French.

25:51.050 --> 25:52.550
So I'm gonna head
back home and pack.

25:52.592 --> 25:53.969
Bye.

25:58.974 --> 26:01.477
Ladies first.

26:01.519 --> 26:03.896
Thank you.

26:03.937 --> 26:07.233
Dixon,

26:07.274 --> 26:08.526
this is unreal.

26:08.566 --> 26:10.694
(chuckles)
Well, uh...

26:10.736 --> 26:12.446
you know, I thought I
went a little overboard,

26:12.488 --> 26:14.614
but, uh, I just hope

26:14.656 --> 26:15.573
you're not wearing anything
flammable.

26:15.615 --> 26:17.993
No, way. Are these kogi
short rib tacos?

26:18.035 --> 26:18.994
Yeah, they are.

26:19.036 --> 26:20.578
I mean, I know

26:20.620 --> 26:22.081
they're
you're favorite.
(chuckles)

26:22.122 --> 26:23.999
I've been chasing
the truck all day
on Twitter.

26:24.041 --> 26:25.418
I made it to Abbot Kinney
and back.

26:25.459 --> 26:26.626
Of course, I had to go

26:26.668 --> 26:28.504
to a different taco truck
for the cokes.

26:28.546 --> 26:30.506
(laughs)
And you got Mexican cokes.

26:30.548 --> 26:32.007
Of course.

26:32.049 --> 26:33.675
Dixon, you...

26:35.511 --> 26:37.096
(car approaches)

26:37.137 --> 26:38.222
Dude, what was that?

26:38.264 --> 26:40.516
Uh...

26:40.558 --> 26:42.268
(car doors closing)

26:42.309 --> 26:43.852
My parents.

26:50.067 --> 26:51.609
Shh.

26:53.446 --> 26:55.573
Mom? Dad?
HARRY:
Hey, buddy,

26:55.613 --> 26:58.158
Mom forgot her wallet!

26:58.200 --> 26:59.993
What would you
like me to say, huh?

27:00.035 --> 27:01.495
That Mom forgot the slip
of paper

27:01.537 --> 27:03.289
with the marriage counselor's
address on it?

27:03.330 --> 27:04.957
I just...
I just feel like

27:04.998 --> 27:06.542
you think everything
is my fault.

27:06.584 --> 27:08.961
Like this whole thing
is... is my fault.

27:09.002 --> 27:10.003
You know I...

27:10.045 --> 27:11.964
You know what?

27:12.005 --> 27:13.299
Save it for Dr. Silla.

27:13.340 --> 27:14.258
What's going on in here?

27:14.300 --> 27:16.260
Oh, uh, you know,

27:16.302 --> 27:18.220
I just, I-I forgot
my wallet.

27:19.346 --> 27:21.890
What is going on?

27:21.932 --> 27:22.475
Nothing.

27:22.516 --> 27:23.976
Why?

27:24.017 --> 27:25.394
You gotta be kidding me, right?

27:25.436 --> 27:27.645
Nothing? Really?

27:27.687 --> 27:30.149
I'm not an idiot, you guys.

27:32.067 --> 27:32.901
ANNIE:
Dixon!

27:32.943 --> 27:33.902
Annie!

27:38.698 --> 27:40.576
Be right back.
Dixon, I have

27:40.618 --> 27:42.369
to talk to you right now.

27:42.411 --> 27:46.332
Uh, right now
isn't the greatest time.

27:46.373 --> 27:48.417
Annie, Annie, talk to us.

27:48.459 --> 27:50.628
Talk to you? Fine!

27:50.668 --> 27:53.130
I know that you two
have been fighting.

27:53.172 --> 27:56.091
And I know it's because
Mom kissed some guy.

27:56.133 --> 27:57.050
Oh, my God.
Annie...

27:57.092 --> 27:58.093
What?!

27:58.135 --> 28:00.554
Look...

28:02.181 --> 28:06.101
Mom and I have
been having some problems,

28:06.143 --> 28:07.520
that's true.

28:07.561 --> 28:09.355
We didn't want to say anything

28:09.396 --> 28:11.231
to you guys until
we understood what was

28:11.273 --> 28:12.525
going on ourselves.

28:16.570 --> 28:19.031
We've been seeing
a counselor.

28:19.072 --> 28:21.450
A marriage counselor?

28:21.492 --> 28:24.161
Yes.

28:24.203 --> 28:25.663
We don't have
dinner plans tonight.

28:25.703 --> 28:27.289
We have a session.

28:27.331 --> 28:30.125
Wait. So Mom kissed who?

28:30.167 --> 28:33.212
That's not important,
and it's not all Mom's fault.

28:33.253 --> 28:35.797
The problems are mutual.

28:35.839 --> 28:39.092
But we don't want you
two to worry about it.

28:39.134 --> 28:44.181
Okay, so... so then there's
nothing to worry about.

28:44.223 --> 28:46.517
You know, you promise that
everything's gonna be okay.

28:53.357 --> 28:54.733
Oh, my God.

28:57.277 --> 28:59.446
Look, we love you guys

28:59.488 --> 29:02.074
and we're doing the
best that we can.

29:07.705 --> 29:10.416
We need to get
to our appointment.

29:12.459 --> 29:13.627
Guys, this is us trying.

29:15.795 --> 29:17.631
We'll talk about it later, okay?

29:19.132 --> 29:20.342
Okay.

29:26.139 --> 29:28.350
I feel like
I'm gonna throw up.

29:28.392 --> 29:31.437
I mean, I'm confused.

29:31.478 --> 29:32.938
What are we supposed to feel
about this now?

29:34.856 --> 29:36.858
What are we gonna do?

29:40.696 --> 29:45.033
Um, can we talk
about this later?

29:45.075 --> 29:46.785
What?

29:49.622 --> 29:52.374
Fine. Whatever.

30:05.638 --> 30:10.517
Hey, uh...
sorry about that.

30:10.559 --> 30:12.603
Uh, family's a little crazy,
I guess. (chuckles)

30:12.645 --> 30:14.480
You okay?

30:14.521 --> 30:17.357
Uh, yeah, yeah.

30:17.399 --> 30:18.484
Um, sorry, about that.

30:18.525 --> 30:20.402
I don't even know what that was.

30:20.444 --> 30:21.820
Okay, Dixon,
just stop apologizing.

30:21.861 --> 30:23.155
I mean, that was...

30:23.196 --> 30:24.406
Messed up.

30:24.448 --> 30:26.617
Yeah.

30:26.659 --> 30:28.535
Yeah.

30:37.877 --> 30:40.130
(knocking)

30:40.172 --> 30:43.300
NAOMI:
Liam!

30:43.342 --> 30:45.511
To the victor
go the spoils.

30:45.552 --> 30:48.597
(chuckles)
Can I pour you a glass?

30:48.639 --> 30:50.349
No, I'm good.

30:50.390 --> 30:52.267
What's going on?

30:52.309 --> 30:54.353
The dragon is slain.

30:54.394 --> 30:56.522
Jen?

30:56.563 --> 30:58.940
I thought you said you were
gonna stay away from her.

30:58.982 --> 31:00.734
I know, I know,
but Jen is a rattlesnake,

31:00.776 --> 31:02.861
you said so yourself,
and you don't let a rattlesnake

31:02.902 --> 31:04.571
slither around screwing
up your life.

31:04.613 --> 31:06.365
You chop off its ugly head.

31:06.406 --> 31:10.035
You should have
seen her face

31:10.076 --> 31:13.121
when I told Olivier about how
she's been whoring around town.

31:13.163 --> 31:15.874
It looked like a pen exploded
onto her Kelly bag.

31:15.915 --> 31:18.377
That's good.

31:18.418 --> 31:20.713
Naomi, something's been
going on with me, and I...

31:20.754 --> 31:21.797
Oh, my God!

31:21.839 --> 31:23.965
What if Olivier's
so pissed at her

31:24.007 --> 31:25.925
that he locks her out
and she has to stay

31:25.967 --> 31:27.678
in a cabana at the
Beach Club or something?

31:27.720 --> 31:29.680
Can you imagine? Ew!

31:29.722 --> 31:30.889
(laughing)

31:30.930 --> 31:32.808
Ew.

31:40.607 --> 31:43.402
Hey. How was the pier?

31:43.443 --> 31:46.905
Uh... it was okay.

31:46.946 --> 31:49.282
Went with Ade.

31:49.324 --> 31:51.660
Navid, it's totally cool,

31:51.702 --> 31:52.786
you know that.
Lila, there's something

31:52.828 --> 31:54.413
that I have to tell you.

31:54.454 --> 31:56.331
I think you're
so amazing,

31:56.373 --> 32:00.419
uh, and you're brilliant
and-and so much fun.

32:00.460 --> 32:01.920
Uh-oh.

32:01.961 --> 32:03.963
Those sound like
bad compliments.

32:10.429 --> 32:12.765
I realized tonight that I still
feel something for Ade.

32:12.806 --> 32:15.434
I don't even know
what it means

32:15.475 --> 32:17.770
or what I'm even
gonna do about it,

32:17.811 --> 32:19.730
but I know it's
not fair to you,

32:19.772 --> 32:21.815
and I think we
should break up.

32:21.857 --> 32:24.610
Wow. Okay.

32:24.651 --> 32:27.195
I-I really am sorry, Lila.

32:35.829 --> 32:37.456
(door opens)

32:37.497 --> 32:39.458
Hey.

32:39.499 --> 32:41.877
What's up?

32:41.919 --> 32:45.589
I'm sorry.

32:45.631 --> 32:47.299
I don't know why I'm here,

32:47.340 --> 32:49.718
but I'm here

32:49.760 --> 32:55.766
and I had a really rough night,

32:55.808 --> 32:58.811
and I needed to blow off
some steam.

32:58.852 --> 33:00.896
Okay.

33:00.938 --> 33:02.564
Can I help?

33:06.693 --> 33:07.861
Do the stern.

33:10.322 --> 33:11.406
Actually...

33:11.448 --> 33:12.658
the other end.

33:12.699 --> 33:14.159
Oh.

33:31.551 --> 33:33.553
It's just ironic.

33:33.595 --> 33:36.974
All these years, I...

33:37.015 --> 33:39.768
I've spent trying
to relax, you know.

33:39.810 --> 33:42.562
Just-just trying to believe

33:42.604 --> 33:45.899
that life can be stable.

33:45.941 --> 33:48.610
That just because my family
was always falling apart

33:48.652 --> 33:50.946
when I was little, doesn't mean
it's going to fall apart now.

33:50.988 --> 33:53.740
Right?

33:53.782 --> 33:55.826
Then when I finally relax...

33:58.495 --> 34:00.330
...it falls apart.

34:08.505 --> 34:11.717
Damn. I must have been rambling.

34:11.757 --> 34:13.467
It's been, like, an hour.

34:13.510 --> 34:15.679
I feel like I owe you
100 bucks or something.

34:15.721 --> 34:17.138
Give me a break, Dixon.

34:17.179 --> 34:19.016
You can't get good
therapy for 100 bucks.

34:19.056 --> 34:20.726
(laughing)

34:20.766 --> 34:26.105
Well, but, Dixon, you have
nothing to apologize for.

34:26.147 --> 34:28.859
I'm actually really
honestly flattered

34:28.900 --> 34:31.069
that you feel like
you can talk to me.

34:33.071 --> 34:36.574
Well, uh, you're just
easy to talk to.

34:39.202 --> 34:42.080
And, look, I know you told
me not to apologize,

34:42.121 --> 34:45.833
but this has got to be
our worst date yet.

34:45.876 --> 34:48.003
I don't think so.

34:48.045 --> 34:51.840
I mean, dates are
for getting to know
each other, right?

34:51.882 --> 34:53.507
Mm-hmm.

34:53.550 --> 34:56.511
And I am getting
to know you.

34:56.553 --> 34:58.764
And I'm

34:58.805 --> 35:00.807
liking what I'm knowing.

35:18.909 --> 35:20.619
Hey, Dad.

35:20.660 --> 35:21.954
Hey.

35:21.995 --> 35:25.540
Silver's a, uh, charming girl.

35:25.582 --> 35:27.793
And she rides a motorcycle.
How cool is that.

35:27.834 --> 35:30.003
Well, a Vespa, but...
Yeah, she is cool.

35:30.045 --> 35:31.004
I'm glad you
think she's cool.

35:33.214 --> 35:35.050
You know you're my favorite,
don't you?

35:35.092 --> 35:37.970
I'm not supposed to say
that, but it's true.

35:38.011 --> 35:40.680
Thanks, Dad.

35:40.722 --> 35:42.557
I'm so proud of you.

35:42.599 --> 35:44.893
I know you can take this
tennis all the way

35:44.935 --> 35:47.145
if you just started taking
it a little more seriously.

35:47.186 --> 35:50.189
Dad, I'm at practice
like ten times a week.

35:50.231 --> 35:55.528
Right, and now you're at
a point where you have
to make a decision.

35:55.570 --> 35:56.905
You going to go pro,

35:56.947 --> 35:59.116
or you going to give out lessons
at the Beach Club.

35:59.157 --> 36:00.450
I want to be Federer.

36:00.492 --> 36:01.785
You know that.
That's all I want.

36:01.827 --> 36:03.703
Then it's settled.

36:03.745 --> 36:05.664
No more distractions.

36:05.705 --> 36:08.792
No more girlfriends.

36:08.834 --> 36:10.085
Break up with her, Teddy.

36:29.646 --> 36:30.981
Hey, superstar.

36:31.023 --> 36:32.816
Hey.

36:32.858 --> 36:35.986
What do you say to a matinee
before your match tonight?

36:36.028 --> 36:38.530
A movie? You're kidding, right?

36:38.571 --> 36:40.657
Um... yes?

36:40.699 --> 36:43.743
Yeah, and I'll just bring
a tub of popcorn to my match.

36:43.785 --> 36:46.663
Look, I don't just
show up, Silver.

36:46.705 --> 36:48.247
I've got to warm up,

36:48.289 --> 36:49.916
I've got to talk to my coach,
I've got to mentally prepare.

36:49.958 --> 36:51.626
I have to focus.

36:51.668 --> 36:53.086
Okay. I'm sorry,
I didn't realize
how involved...

36:53.128 --> 36:55.588
Look, I got to get to class.

37:03.972 --> 37:06.141
Rise and shine, pet.

37:06.183 --> 37:07.726
What the hell are
you doing here?

37:07.767 --> 37:09.102
Oh, I'm just here

37:09.144 --> 37:12.230
to thank you for making me
ten million Euro richer.

37:12.271 --> 37:15.067
That's approximately
$16 million U.S.

37:15.108 --> 37:16.234
Croissant?

37:16.275 --> 37:20.155
What are you talking about?

37:20.197 --> 37:22.657
Last night, your performance
was truly magnificent,

37:22.699 --> 37:24.659
and absolutely predictable.

37:24.701 --> 37:27.370
Olivier was so distraught

37:27.412 --> 37:30.082
he went running straight into
the, shall we say, arms

37:30.123 --> 37:31.124
of another woman.

37:31.166 --> 37:34.002
Which is exactly
what he's done

37:34.044 --> 37:36.046
every other time he's
gotten jealous in the past.

37:36.088 --> 37:37.839
You wanted him to cheat on you?

37:37.881 --> 37:39.883
When we got back together,

37:39.925 --> 37:41.885
we added a fidelity clause
to our prenup.

37:41.927 --> 37:44.637
A few choice snaps
from my PI,

37:44.679 --> 37:46.806
and voila, I'm 16 mill richer.

37:46.848 --> 37:48.266
You're disturbed.

37:48.307 --> 37:51.186
Now, now.
Let's not get nasty.

37:51.228 --> 37:53.230
You know, you really should be
a little nicer to me

37:53.271 --> 37:54.647
now that I'll be handling
your finances.

37:54.689 --> 37:57.150
What?

37:57.192 --> 38:00.237
Well, I felt obliged
to tell Daddy

38:00.278 --> 38:02.864
how you've been blowing
through your trust fund.

38:02.906 --> 38:05.075
The poor guy,
he started panicking.

38:05.117 --> 38:06.952
Luckily, I offered to help.

38:06.993 --> 38:08.620
This is not happening.

38:08.661 --> 38:09.871
This is a nightmare.

38:09.913 --> 38:11.998
Naomi, aren't you hungry?

38:27.097 --> 38:29.266
You beat him in straight sets.

38:29.307 --> 38:31.226
I told you, all you
got to do is focus.

38:31.268 --> 38:32.894
Give me this thing.

38:32.936 --> 38:34.604
We'll put it in
the trophy room.

38:34.646 --> 38:35.730
Wimbledon,
here we come.

38:47.700 --> 38:49.244
Hey, Silver.

38:49.286 --> 38:50.620
Hey.

38:50.662 --> 38:53.039
Let me get this for you.
Thanks.

38:53.081 --> 38:55.167
I was actually just on my
way over to your place.

38:55.208 --> 38:56.042
Look, I've got
to apologize.

38:56.084 --> 38:57.585
I was thoughtless...

38:57.627 --> 38:59.587
No, no, no, I'm the one
who should apologize to you.

38:59.629 --> 39:01.840
I was stressed and I shouldn't
have taken it out on you.

39:01.881 --> 39:02.799
I'm really sorry.

39:02.841 --> 39:03.967
So we're even?

39:04.009 --> 39:05.051
Even.

39:05.093 --> 39:06.344
How was your match?

39:06.385 --> 39:09.722
I won in straight sets.

39:09.764 --> 39:10.932
Wow. I assume that's good.

39:10.974 --> 39:12.892
As you know, I'm not
exactly a tennis buff,

39:12.934 --> 39:14.686
but winning's winning, right?
Yeah.

39:14.727 --> 39:17.105
Except no.

39:17.147 --> 39:19.316
I thought winning today
would make me happy,

39:19.398 --> 39:22.235
but when I won
and I didn't have you,

39:22.277 --> 39:25.030
I realized it doesn't
mean anything if you're
not there, 'cause...

39:27.365 --> 39:28.825
Because...

39:28.867 --> 39:31.369
Because...

39:31.410 --> 39:33.121
Because you're
falling in love?

39:34.247 --> 39:36.291
Because I am in love.

40:55.912 --> 40:58.248
Take five.
Thank you.

40:58.290 --> 41:01.167
Damn, you wrote this
song in two days?

41:01.209 --> 41:02.252
This single's gonna be huge.

41:02.294 --> 41:04.462
It's got a great hook.

41:04.503 --> 41:06.423
Did you write it
for your boyfriend?

41:06.464 --> 41:09.301
No, I don't have
a boyfriend.

41:09.342 --> 41:11.136
Uh, hi.
Hey.

41:11.177 --> 41:13.012
I'm here to see Adrianna.

41:13.054 --> 41:14.306
Oh, she's inside.

41:14.347 --> 41:16.057
Cute flowers.

41:16.099 --> 41:19.311
A beautiful girl like you
doesn't have a boyfriend?

41:19.352 --> 41:22.855
Um, no. I don't.

41:22.897 --> 41:25.066
There's no one,
no special guy...

41:25.108 --> 41:26.484
no one.

41:29.362 --> 41:30.571
I'm glad.
