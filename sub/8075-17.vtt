[music playing]

00:03.771 --> 00:06.607
[theme music]

00:08.642 --> 00:11.812
Well, last day
on the job, boys.

00:11.845 --> 00:13.781
So tomorrow when we come
in to have our free coffee

00:13.814 --> 00:17.785
and donuts, it won't
technically be legal.

00:17.818 --> 00:19.087
Hey, Dan, I just
wanna thank you

00:19.120 --> 00:21.155
for taking me with you and
Bob on this new drywall job

00:21.189 --> 00:22.290
that you got.

00:22.323 --> 00:25.593
Well, Mark, we looked
at a lot of applicants.

00:25.626 --> 00:29.763
We found out you were the only
one married to my daughter.

00:29.797 --> 00:33.033
So [sigh] I guess I better
pack up all my personal stuff

00:33.067 --> 00:33.867
to take it home.

00:37.505 --> 00:38.306
There.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.111
You gonna miss
this place, Dan?

00:43.144 --> 00:44.878
I don't know, Bob.

00:44.912 --> 00:46.514
I have my memories.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.349
Like this.

00:48.382 --> 00:51.552
I bet I've stapled 1,000
office memos with this thing.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.826
And how many times have
you guys come in here

00:58.859 --> 01:03.231
and caught me using this
crazy tape dispenser?

01:03.264 --> 01:04.432
I've never seen you use that.

01:08.869 --> 01:12.005
Pens, pencils, paper clips.

01:12.039 --> 01:15.143
Memories, memories, memories.

01:15.176 --> 01:17.345
Well, guess that about does it.

01:17.378 --> 01:19.046
I'm gonna call Rosie, tell
her I'm on my way home.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.784
Tell you one thing, Mark--

01:23.817 --> 01:28.556
the city of Lanford is losing
a great asset right there.

01:28.589 --> 01:30.057
I'm sure they can get
another stapler, Bob.

01:33.161 --> 01:34.795
Hey honey.

01:34.828 --> 01:37.064
Yeah, we're just
about done here.

01:37.097 --> 01:39.900
I just wanted my last call
from the office to be to you.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.001
I love you.

01:41.034 --> 01:41.902
[aw]

01:41.935 --> 01:44.405
OK, bye-bye.

01:44.438 --> 01:47.208
[applause]

01:50.678 --> 01:54.014
Guess that about does it.

01:54.047 --> 02:00.221
This is Dan Conner,
punching out.

02:00.254 --> 02:03.123
[applause]

02:09.129 --> 02:13.234
I can't believe we forgot this.

02:13.267 --> 02:16.170
[theme music]

03:06.153 --> 03:07.588
Hey, Rosie?

03:07.621 --> 03:08.989
Come here, I wanna
show you something.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.958
OK, OK, but this
better be good,

03:10.991 --> 03:12.326
because they're
showing that "Full

03:12.360 --> 03:14.662
House" where they think one of
those little twins is dying.

03:17.998 --> 03:21.369
Lookee here-- this is our
massive accumulation of bills.

03:21.402 --> 03:22.336
I'll get the lighter fluid.

03:22.370 --> 03:25.038
No, no, no no.

03:25.072 --> 03:27.575
See, I've sorted them by
when they were received--

03:27.608 --> 03:30.378
Clinton, Bush, Reagan.

03:30.411 --> 03:34.047
[applause]

03:34.081 --> 03:36.884
See here where it
says amount enclosed?

03:36.917 --> 03:39.487
I thought it might be fun
to put a number in there.

03:39.520 --> 03:40.388
Why?

03:40.421 --> 03:41.822
Because we can.

03:41.855 --> 03:45.726
Look at this, not only did
they give me last week's pay,

03:45.759 --> 03:48.429
but I got my unused
vacation time

03:48.462 --> 03:50.698
and drew the money out
of my pension fund.

03:50.731 --> 03:51.965
If I'd have known
all you had to do

03:51.999 --> 03:53.667
to clean up like this
was quit your job,

03:53.701 --> 03:56.136
I'd have done it long ago.

03:56.169 --> 03:59.006
I've never even seen a
check for that amount of money

03:59.039 --> 03:59.873
before.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.575
Wh-- what does that comma mean?

04:04.412 --> 04:07.481
You know, if we
pay everything off,

04:07.515 --> 04:10.183
we'll finally be debt-free.

04:10.217 --> 04:11.919
So we gotta be smart here.

04:11.952 --> 04:13.554
I say we pay half
the bills then split

04:13.587 --> 04:15.823
the rest between an
aggressive money market

04:15.856 --> 04:17.257
and a conservative mutual fund.

04:26.534 --> 04:31.339
I-- I was practicing
that all the way home.

04:31.372 --> 04:32.773
Yeah, but you know, I thi--

04:32.806 --> 04:34.174
I think you're right.

04:34.207 --> 04:35.643
We shouldn't, uh-- if
we're gonna invest it,

04:35.676 --> 04:38.446
we shouldn't put it
all in one place.

04:38.479 --> 04:41.315
I say we put half of
it into the mattress,

04:41.349 --> 04:43.784
and then the other
half in tomato cans

04:43.817 --> 04:46.420
buried under bush
in the back yard.

04:46.454 --> 04:49.357
Well, wherever we put it,
it's gotta be safe and secure.

04:49.390 --> 04:52.225
We really do have to make a
mature decision about this.

04:52.259 --> 04:54.194
Yeah.

04:54.227 --> 04:55.829
I wanna go to Paris!

04:55.863 --> 04:58.466
I hear that the French
people are really rude

04:58.499 --> 04:59.933
and they hate Americans,
so I will, like,

04:59.967 --> 05:01.101
totally fit right in there.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.238
Roseanne.

05:05.272 --> 05:07.408
Yeah, I know, that's stupid.

05:07.441 --> 05:08.642
But what about England?

05:08.676 --> 05:12.746
Or, uh, you know, Italy
or China or even Canada?

05:12.780 --> 05:15.649
But not Canada, because we can
already buy their bacon here.

05:15.683 --> 05:17.518
I know!

05:17.551 --> 05:19.052
I've got it!

05:19.086 --> 05:20.488
I've got it.

05:20.521 --> 05:23.557
There's some place we could
go to see all of these places

05:23.591 --> 05:25.158
at once.

05:25.192 --> 05:28.496
International
House of Pancakes.

05:28.529 --> 05:30.964
No, but I'll give
you two hints--

05:30.998 --> 05:36.103
Florida and the
happiest place on earth.

05:39.973 --> 05:43.544
We're going to Gator World!

05:43.577 --> 05:45.513
No, you idiot!

05:45.546 --> 05:47.214
Disney World!

05:47.247 --> 05:50.718
It's perfect, because they have
that Epcot Center thing, OK?

05:50.751 --> 05:52.786
So like, say you're in Italy
and you get really bored.

05:52.820 --> 05:55.456
You just walk right
over to China, OK?

05:55.489 --> 05:58.091
I know, for real, that
in the real world,

05:58.125 --> 06:01.028
that would actually take days.

06:01.061 --> 06:04.331
We can't blow my hard-earned
cash on a vacation.

06:04.364 --> 06:08.335
I hear they have something
called a beer garden.

06:08.368 --> 06:09.202
Hot dog!

06:15.042 --> 06:16.209
It'll be so great!

06:16.243 --> 06:17.511
We'll take the whole family.

06:17.545 --> 06:18.345
Oh.

06:20.948 --> 06:23.050
Them.

06:23.083 --> 06:24.351
No, think about it, Dan.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.520
Um, Becky's applying for
college and Darlene's

06:26.554 --> 06:27.788
gonna be graduating soon.

06:27.821 --> 06:29.423
This is probably the
last chance we will

06:29.457 --> 06:31.725
ever get for a family vacation.

06:31.759 --> 06:33.994
Well, we could sleep
on it, I guess, and--

06:34.027 --> 06:35.128
Hey, everybody!

06:35.162 --> 06:40.734
Cancel next week, we're
going to Disney World!

06:40.768 --> 06:42.703
We can discuss
it in the morning.

06:42.736 --> 06:46.073
[applause] [theme music]

06:49.610 --> 06:52.446
Can we just do this
meeting without Becky?

06:52.480 --> 06:56.416
In fact, while we're at it, can
we do everything without Becky?

06:56.450 --> 06:57.751
No, she's part of this family.

06:57.785 --> 06:59.553
We're not having a family
meeting without her.

06:59.587 --> 07:01.321
Besides, I just called her.
She'll be here any minute.

07:04.558 --> 07:05.526
Did I hear right?

07:05.559 --> 07:07.695
We're going on vacation?

07:07.728 --> 07:09.362
NARRATOR: Ladies and
gentlemen, the role of Becky,

07:09.396 --> 07:11.832
originally played by Lecy
Goranson, then by Sarah Chalke,

07:11.865 --> 07:13.266
then by Lecy Goranson,
will be played

07:13.300 --> 07:15.469
this evening by Sarah Chalke.

07:15.503 --> 07:18.171
The taking of flash photographs
or use of recording devices

07:18.205 --> 07:22.009
is strictly prohibited.

07:22.042 --> 07:23.376
Disney World?

07:23.410 --> 07:25.513
I've always wanted to go there!

07:25.546 --> 07:27.515
Aren't you glad that
you're here this week?

07:35.756 --> 07:37.157
Wait, isn't that
the place where

07:37.190 --> 07:40.293
happy families go to have fun?

07:40.327 --> 07:42.630
We're not letting
that stop us.

07:42.663 --> 07:45.465
Can Mark go?

07:45.499 --> 07:47.334
Damn.

07:47.367 --> 07:49.570
He is family.

07:49.603 --> 07:51.238
Sure.

07:51.271 --> 07:52.906
What about aunt Jackie?

07:52.940 --> 07:54.942
Of course, she's family.

07:54.975 --> 07:58.512
I'll be in the
basement, I guess.

07:58.546 --> 08:03.450
(SINGING) When you
wish upon a star.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.553
Oh, David, get a grip.

08:05.586 --> 08:07.120
Of course you're family.

08:07.154 --> 08:08.355
Oh, I love Mickey Mouse!

08:08.388 --> 08:10.090
I love Mickey Mouse!
(SINGING) I love Mickey Mouse!

08:10.123 --> 08:10.991
I--

08:11.024 --> 08:12.059
You will stop that now.

08:16.597 --> 08:19.032
Your job is to
contact a travel agent

08:19.066 --> 08:22.936
and make sure you get us a
really good package deal.

08:22.970 --> 08:26.406
OK, we've got a lot of prep
work that needs to be done

08:26.439 --> 08:27.675
before we can make this happen.

08:27.708 --> 08:29.376
For instance, we need
to pack our clothes.

08:29.409 --> 08:31.612
Darlene, go down to
the luggage store,

08:31.645 --> 08:35.616
look in the dumpster in the
back, bring us the boxes.

08:35.649 --> 08:37.618
Becky, your job-- get
to the airport early,

08:37.651 --> 08:39.820
collect a lot of
those carts, and turn

08:39.853 --> 08:42.389
the quarters over to me.

08:42.422 --> 08:44.057
What about the baby?

08:44.091 --> 08:47.595
Oh, yeah, well, somebody does
need to take care of the baby.

08:47.628 --> 08:50.097
Now, that person will not be
able to go on any of the rides

08:50.130 --> 08:51.832
and will have to sit
there every single day

08:51.865 --> 08:53.901
listening to the rest of
us talk about how much fun

08:53.934 --> 08:54.802
we're having.

08:54.835 --> 08:56.336
So that's gonna be pure torture.

08:56.369 --> 08:57.137
We'll get mom.

09:00.407 --> 09:01.775
What's my job?

09:01.809 --> 09:04.044
Cancel the paper.

09:04.077 --> 09:05.846
You mean cancel
the neighbor's paper?

09:05.879 --> 09:08.548
Well, that would
be the paper, Dan.

09:08.582 --> 09:09.850
OK.

09:09.883 --> 09:11.518
While I'm at it I'll
also shut down the gas,

09:11.551 --> 09:12.720
electricity, the water.

09:12.753 --> 09:14.788
We're not moving.

09:14.822 --> 09:18.191
Well, sorry, I've
never done this before.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.126
OK.

09:19.159 --> 09:21.194
Well, we're all set.

09:21.228 --> 09:22.896
Mom?

09:22.930 --> 09:27.034
Oh, yeah, uh, start
practicing your limp,

09:27.067 --> 09:30.804
'cause we're gonna wanna
park close to the terminal.

09:30.838 --> 09:32.005
No, school.

09:32.039 --> 09:34.541
I mean, I don't think my
teacher's gonna let me go.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.209
I'm supposed to make a
model out of something

09:36.243 --> 09:38.712
from ancient Greece
by next week.

09:38.746 --> 09:41.548
I don't think I could live with
myself if I just blew it off.

09:46.253 --> 09:50.758
Well, you are not going to
spoil our family vacation, OK?

09:50.791 --> 09:52.660
You are a Conner.

09:52.693 --> 09:55.195
You are skipping school,
blowing off that project.

09:55.228 --> 10:03.603
Now you sit down here,
turn on that television,

10:03.637 --> 10:07.975
watch it, and think
about what you just said.

10:08.008 --> 10:10.878
[theme music]

10:12.946 --> 10:15.716
OK, Mrs. Conner, I found
us a great fare to Orlando,

10:15.749 --> 10:18.151
but they only have six
seats and we need eight.

10:22.756 --> 10:24.725
So, uh, should we
go ahead and order

10:24.758 --> 10:28.595
pet carriers for DJ and Mark?

10:28.628 --> 10:31.765
Children, children, children,
pay very close attention here.

10:31.799 --> 10:34.434
I'm about to pass on
a old family secret.

10:40.908 --> 10:42.142
Hello?

10:42.175 --> 10:45.312
Uh, yes I'm going to need
to cancel my reservations,

10:45.345 --> 10:49.983
uh, for the 4:15 flight
on Sunday to Orlando.

10:50.017 --> 10:51.218
Uh, my name is Smith.

10:54.688 --> 10:55.622
Oh.

10:55.655 --> 10:56.456
Man.

11:04.631 --> 11:09.569
Yes, hello, this is, uh,
Mrs. Miller, and, uh, I'm

11:09.602 --> 11:13.340
going to need to cancel my
reservations for the 4:15

11:13.373 --> 11:17.277
flight on Sunday to Orlando.

11:17.310 --> 11:19.579
It's not?

11:19.612 --> 11:23.483
Uh, well perhaps it's, uh,
booked under my maiden name.

11:23.516 --> 11:26.419
Uh, Habib.

11:26.453 --> 11:27.554
Yes, that's right, Habib.

11:27.587 --> 11:29.322
Yes, that is me.

11:29.356 --> 11:32.726
[applause]

11:32.760 --> 11:34.294
Cool, thank you very much.

11:34.327 --> 11:37.064
Oh, no, I won't need
to reschedule at all.

11:37.097 --> 11:37.898
Praise Allah.

11:41.434 --> 11:42.302
Call him back.

11:42.335 --> 11:45.806
I think they got an opening now.

11:45.839 --> 11:49.176
Yet another federal offense
I've witnessed in this house.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.544
Man, everything is
totally coming together.

11:51.578 --> 11:52.445
And why?

11:52.479 --> 11:56.884
Because I am the puppet master.

11:56.917 --> 11:59.686
Roseanne, don't kill me.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.488
Everybody wants
something from me.

12:01.521 --> 12:02.555
Big trouble.

12:02.589 --> 12:03.857
I've been going over
the diner schedule.

12:03.891 --> 12:05.525
There's no way we can
get out of our shifts.

12:05.558 --> 12:06.827
Leon can't work extra hours.

12:06.860 --> 12:10.697
Nancy's taking off to go to
the erotic cartoon festival.

12:10.730 --> 12:14.234
I tried calling former
employees, temporary agencies.

12:14.267 --> 12:15.869
There's nothing we can do.

12:15.903 --> 12:17.805
Damn it.

12:17.838 --> 12:22.776
Wait a minute, I'm surprised I
didn't think of this earlier.

12:22.810 --> 12:27.714
[exhaling deeply]

12:27.747 --> 12:28.916
There.

12:28.949 --> 12:30.517
What's you do?

12:30.550 --> 12:33.020
I just made our problem
into Leon's problem,

12:33.053 --> 12:34.454
so I hope he handles
it better than we did.

12:34.487 --> 12:38.291
So how is the, uh,
reservations there, David?

12:38.325 --> 12:39.860
We are all booked to
Orlando, Mrs. Conner.

12:39.893 --> 12:40.760
Woo!

12:40.794 --> 12:41.761
Or should I say, Mrs. Habib?

12:41.795 --> 12:43.430
Ooh-hoo-hoo!

12:43.463 --> 12:45.398
Well, grab your veils, gals.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.968
We are going to Disney World!

12:48.001 --> 12:49.436
Woo!

12:49.469 --> 12:52.339
[theme music]

13:03.783 --> 13:07.587
Look, I told you the pilot said
he's flying as fast as he can.

13:12.225 --> 13:13.894
No, it's not about that.

13:13.927 --> 13:16.830
It's just that my family is
spread out all over the place.

13:16.864 --> 13:20.767
Do you think you could ask
this nice lady if she'd move?

13:20.800 --> 13:23.603
No, and thank you for
making us your airline.

13:26.406 --> 13:27.507
Well, where are
we gonna go first?

13:31.644 --> 13:32.512
Uh, Dan?

13:32.545 --> 13:33.646
Hm?

13:33.680 --> 13:35.015
Could you take him to
see mom for a minute?

13:35.048 --> 13:36.649
Yeah, sure.

13:36.683 --> 13:39.419
Excuse me.

13:39.452 --> 13:42.755
Whoa, he's gained weight
since this morning.

13:42.789 --> 13:43.891
Pardon me, sorry.

13:47.760 --> 13:51.431
Hey, did I miss a
belt loop back there?

13:51.464 --> 13:52.933
Hey, hey, Dan?

13:52.966 --> 13:53.901
Yeah?

13:53.934 --> 13:54.968
How come we're
not all weightless?

13:57.770 --> 13:59.172
We are.

13:59.206 --> 14:01.875
I'm just wearing special shoes.

14:01.909 --> 14:05.045
There's my little Jerry!

14:05.078 --> 14:06.713
Oh, what's wrong, honey?

14:06.746 --> 14:08.882
Give me the juice, Roseanne!

14:08.916 --> 14:09.782
Yeah.

14:09.816 --> 14:10.783
David, head's up.

14:14.087 --> 14:17.925
Man, Disney World is huge!

14:17.958 --> 14:19.292
Uh, Jackie?

14:19.326 --> 14:22.762
The blue part is the water,
and the brown part is the land.

14:22.795 --> 14:25.265
Why don't we make
this home base?

14:25.298 --> 14:26.967
Yeah, that's a good idea.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.302
OK everybody, listen up, now.

14:29.336 --> 14:32.205
If we get separated or you
get lost from the herd,

14:32.239 --> 14:35.442
we'll all meet up
in Fantasy Land.

14:35.475 --> 14:41.081
Wait, wait, what do you
mean, if we get separated?

14:41.114 --> 14:43.183
I mean this is a
family vacation, Darlene.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.085
We have to all stick together.

14:45.118 --> 14:46.453
You're kidding, right?

14:46.486 --> 14:49.189
I mean, I'm not flying
1,000 miles with you people

14:49.222 --> 14:51.291
just to sample waffles
from around the world.

14:54.394 --> 14:56.363
I don't believe her.

14:56.396 --> 14:59.599
You will stick with
the herd, young lady.

14:59.632 --> 15:02.435
Come on, dad, we
have to split up.

15:02.469 --> 15:05.105
So what are you telling me,
that you all feel like this?

15:05.138 --> 15:07.707
Hey, I have felt
that way since I was 4.

15:13.846 --> 15:16.516
Can you believe my kids
not wanting to be with me?

15:16.549 --> 15:17.350
That is shocking.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.222
I'll be with you, honey.

15:22.255 --> 15:24.157
Damn it, Dan.

15:24.191 --> 15:25.725
I took care of
every single problem

15:25.758 --> 15:28.828
that would have ruined our
family vacation except one--

15:28.861 --> 15:30.964
our family.

15:30.998 --> 15:33.300
I gotta go check on my baby.

15:33.333 --> 15:38.905
Here, guard these pretzels
as if they were potato chips.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.041
So mom, is he OK?

15:41.074 --> 15:44.311
Yes, but I think
he misses his mommy.

15:44.344 --> 15:46.679
Excuse me, if you slide into
that seat right there, then

15:46.713 --> 15:48.415
maybe I can get by.

15:48.448 --> 15:49.316
[crack]

15:49.349 --> 15:51.184
[gasp]

15:51.218 --> 15:52.652
Oh, man, I'm sorry.

15:52.685 --> 15:56.156
I hope that was a
Cheeto I stepped on.

15:56.189 --> 15:59.926
Whatever it was, it
doesn't work anymore anyway.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.795
[applause]

16:04.397 --> 16:05.665
Come on, Jer.

16:05.698 --> 16:08.001
Come and take a walk with momma.

16:08.035 --> 16:09.069
Oh, there's mommy.

16:16.076 --> 16:18.645
I think it's so wonderful that
men like you have found a niche

16:18.678 --> 16:19.712
in the airline industry.

16:24.351 --> 16:28.021
Your brothers and sisters
are a buncha ingrates.

16:28.055 --> 16:29.722
Now I know how that
Queen Mother feels.

16:33.460 --> 16:36.296
Wow!

16:36.329 --> 16:40.133
Hey now, this is living!

16:40.167 --> 16:43.103
Look at the size of these seats!

16:43.136 --> 16:44.404
I knew I wasn't dreaming.

16:44.437 --> 16:46.839
It's true-- rich people are fat.

16:46.873 --> 16:49.442
[baby crying]

16:51.344 --> 16:54.013
Oh, look at this,
it's got a foot rest.

16:54.047 --> 16:56.583
And the best magazines.

16:56.616 --> 16:58.585
Man, this is like Supercuts!

16:58.618 --> 17:01.421
[theme music]

17:08.795 --> 17:12.432
Hey, have you
seen your mother?

17:12.465 --> 17:13.500
No.

17:13.533 --> 17:16.969
But hasn't this been
a wonderful flight?

17:17.003 --> 17:19.772
Guys, she went that way
through those curtains.

17:19.806 --> 17:20.773
Through those curtains?

17:20.807 --> 17:23.210
The first class curtains?

17:23.243 --> 17:27.214
No Conner's ever been through
those curtains before.

17:27.247 --> 17:30.250
Yeah, well, that's
where she went.

17:30.283 --> 17:34.121
Well, better go after her.

17:37.390 --> 17:38.191
How do I look?

17:45.332 --> 17:48.701
Oh, boy, mom and
dad up in first class.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.937
Guess they won't be taking
any pictures for the brochures

17:50.970 --> 17:53.473
on this flight, huh?

17:53.506 --> 17:54.374
What's going on?

17:54.407 --> 17:55.575
They're still up there.

17:55.608 --> 17:57.076
Why hasn't that flight
attendant kicked them out?

17:57.110 --> 17:58.245
Well, it's probably
a little hard

17:58.278 --> 18:00.580
to do when you're hog tied.

18:00.613 --> 18:03.450
They probably got
arrested and handcuffed

18:03.483 --> 18:06.253
the minute they went up there.

18:06.286 --> 18:07.787
Mark, go check on them!

18:07.820 --> 18:08.621
OK.

18:14.561 --> 18:15.928
Yeah, good idea, Jackie.

18:15.962 --> 18:19.999
Send a lifeless probe up
to make sure it's safe.

18:20.032 --> 18:21.801
God, I can't believe
you guys are trying

18:21.834 --> 18:23.270
to get my husband in trouble.

18:23.303 --> 18:24.571
Why wouldn't you believe it?

18:24.604 --> 18:26.606
I was the one that put the
plastic gun in his carry on.

18:34.747 --> 18:36.115
Still nothing.

18:36.149 --> 18:36.983
Ha!

18:37.016 --> 18:37.817
Bye.

18:40.520 --> 18:45.258
Maybe there's no front to
this plane and they're just--

18:45.292 --> 18:49.329
they're just walking
off the edge.

18:49.362 --> 18:50.663
(SARCASTICALLY)
Well, in that case,

18:50.697 --> 18:54.033
I'd better get on air phone
and warn the village below!

18:54.066 --> 18:55.768
Come on, David.
- Darlene, no!

18:55.802 --> 18:56.836
Come on, David!

18:56.869 --> 18:58.805
Isn't there a cover
charge or something?

19:02.642 --> 19:04.110
If they're all sitting
up in first class,

19:04.143 --> 19:06.379
I'm gonna sneak up there, too.

19:06.413 --> 19:09.816
I'm joining you!

19:09.849 --> 19:12.285
Ro, mom!

19:12.319 --> 19:13.820
Mom!

19:13.853 --> 19:14.654
Mom!

19:19.659 --> 19:22.529
[theme music]

19:27.534 --> 19:30.303
Oh, steward, my towel's
beginning to cool.

19:35.475 --> 19:40.079
Ooh, ooh, ow, ow, ow, ow,
ow, ow, ow, ow ow, ow, ow!

19:40.112 --> 19:41.514
[hisses]

19:41.548 --> 19:43.015
No, no, not for my hands.

19:43.049 --> 19:46.386
I want that one on my feet.

19:46.419 --> 19:48.855
Sir, sir?

19:48.888 --> 19:52.525
You actually cut the
crusts off of these?

19:52.559 --> 19:53.360
Can I have them?

19:58.931 --> 20:00.700
Mom, what is this?

20:00.733 --> 20:03.270
Oh, well that's
what fish looks

20:03.303 --> 20:07.840
like before they cut it up into
sticks and deep fat fry it.

20:07.874 --> 20:11.043
I wouldn't eat it if I was you.

20:11.077 --> 20:12.178
Hey, bud!

20:12.211 --> 20:15.582
Bud, you sure it's OK
for us to stay up here?

20:15.615 --> 20:16.549
Oh, yes.

20:16.583 --> 20:21.654
The other passengers
all took a vote

20:21.688 --> 20:23.923
and insisted that
you stay up here.

20:23.956 --> 20:28.695
Isn't that great, Dan?
We make friends wherever we go.

20:28.728 --> 20:29.929
I love it up here!

20:29.962 --> 20:34.934
This is my 10th glass of
fresh-squeezed orange juice.

20:34.967 --> 20:37.236
My stomach kinda hurts.

20:37.270 --> 20:40.006
You know, this is
pretty great, mom.

20:40.039 --> 20:41.073
Yeah, listen.

20:41.107 --> 20:42.008
You know, we were
thinking that maybe it

20:42.041 --> 20:43.410
would be kinda
cool if, you know,

20:43.443 --> 20:46.746
we spend a little time together
as a family once we get there.

20:46.779 --> 20:49.616
Yeah, you know,
not the whole time.

20:49.649 --> 20:53.152
You know what they
say-- nothing in excess.

20:53.185 --> 20:57.056
No, real-- people
really do say that.

20:57.089 --> 21:00.192
Oh, you guys, that is so nice.

21:00.226 --> 21:03.095
I'm so excited we're going
on a family vacation!

21:03.129 --> 21:05.264
Man, it's totally awesome!

21:05.298 --> 21:06.198
Ooh!

21:06.232 --> 21:07.133
Everybody!

21:07.166 --> 21:08.668
Channel 12 on your headsets!

21:08.701 --> 21:09.502
Nipsey Russell!

21:15.908 --> 21:17.610
[laughter]

21:29.088 --> 21:29.956
He's funny!

21:29.989 --> 21:33.259
[theme music]
