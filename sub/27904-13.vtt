00:02.567 --> 00:04.526
Previously on
Man with a Plan...

00:04.569 --> 00:06.876
My little sister's here.Hey, Kelly.

00:06.919 --> 00:09.444
Why did you--
When did you come here?

00:09.487 --> 00:11.533
They fired you? What happened?

00:11.576 --> 00:14.405
I embezzled a tiny bit of money.

00:14.449 --> 00:16.103
I'm jealous of you.

00:16.146 --> 00:18.540
I guess this is like
The Tortoise and the Hare.

00:18.583 --> 00:23.023
I'm the sleek, sexy bunny

00:23.066 --> 00:26.504
losing to you,
the slow, scaly turtle.

00:31.205 --> 00:32.858
Thanks for coming by.
We wanted you here

00:32.902 --> 00:34.512
because we're having
an intervention.

00:34.556 --> 00:37.341
Okay, hold on, a lot of people
drink wine at lunch.

00:37.385 --> 00:40.518
No, Marcy, it's
not for you.

00:40.562 --> 00:43.173
Oh, this better not be
about me and the dog track.

00:43.217 --> 00:45.784
You said you weren't going
to the track anymore.

00:45.828 --> 00:47.177
I'm not.

00:47.221 --> 00:50.441
Look, the intervention
is for Lowell.

00:50.485 --> 00:51.442
Kelly's got
her hooks

00:51.486 --> 00:53.270
in him and
it's my fault.

00:53.314 --> 00:57.970
Oh, honey, we're not assigning
blame out loud.

00:58.014 --> 01:00.364
Look, we need your help
convincing Lowell to dump her

01:00.408 --> 01:02.671
because she's
bad for him.

01:02.714 --> 01:04.499
Yeah. And me. Since Kelly
moved in with him,

01:04.542 --> 01:06.109
Lowell hasn't been
at work all week.

01:06.153 --> 01:09.765
He's got stacks of whatever
he does piling up.

01:10.983 --> 01:12.115
The longer this goes on,

01:12.159 --> 01:13.464
the worse it's gonna be for him

01:13.508 --> 01:15.597
when she breaks his heart.
He's my friend.

01:15.640 --> 01:17.642
I can't sit by
and let that happen.

01:17.686 --> 01:20.819
We're in. These things
are open bar, right?

01:22.821 --> 01:24.823
I'm asking
for a friend.

01:25.955 --> 01:27.087
Hey, Dad.

01:27.130 --> 01:28.523
Hey, your mother told me

01:28.566 --> 01:30.264
you're having an intervention.

01:30.307 --> 01:33.005
Are we straightening out
the boozer or the gambler?

01:38.489 --> 01:40.752
Okay, that's Lowell. Wait,
wait, wait, one more thing,

01:40.796 --> 01:43.451
I have watched every episode
of Intervention,okay?

01:43.494 --> 01:46.845
It is intense, emotional,
and almost never works.

01:47.977 --> 01:49.587
Good luck, everybody.

01:52.590 --> 01:54.288
Hey, Lowell.

01:54.331 --> 01:57.204
Oh, you got a little
something all over here.

01:57.247 --> 01:59.771
I grew a goatee.

01:59.815 --> 02:01.512
Oh, well, that makes sense.

02:01.556 --> 02:03.035
You love animals
and now your face

02:03.079 --> 02:04.689
looks like a raccoon
walking away.

02:06.561 --> 02:08.302
It was Kelly's idea
and I like it.

02:08.345 --> 02:11.043
I get to stroke it
when I think about stuff.

02:11.087 --> 02:12.349
That sounds fun.
Maybe I'll grow a...

02:12.393 --> 02:13.872
No, baby.

02:13.916 --> 02:16.832
Don, why don't you get
Lowell a glass of wine?

02:16.875 --> 02:18.529
Oh, actually, Kelly's
gotten me into scotch.

02:18.573 --> 02:20.009
At first
it was awful,

02:20.052 --> 02:23.578
but now that it burned off
all my taste buds, I love it.

02:23.621 --> 02:27.756
Okay, buddy, h-have a seat.

02:32.064 --> 02:35.024
Why is everyone
so serious?

02:35.067 --> 02:39.202
Is it my goatee? It does
set a mood of sexy danger.

02:40.899 --> 02:44.207
No, no. No,
we're serious

02:44.251 --> 02:47.210
because we're having
an intervention.

02:47.254 --> 02:49.212
Oh.

02:49.256 --> 02:52.563
Well, I think Marcy
drinks a normal amount.

02:52.607 --> 02:56.176
It's not for Marcy.

02:56.219 --> 02:58.569
Although, we should probably
put one on the books for her.

03:00.397 --> 03:01.877
No, it's for you.

03:01.920 --> 03:05.446
Lowell, we love you,

03:05.489 --> 03:07.709
and we feel like
we're losing you.

03:07.752 --> 03:09.232
They say that every
time on the show.

03:09.276 --> 03:10.451
It's how you
kick things off.

03:11.800 --> 03:14.194
What are you talking about?Kelly.

03:14.237 --> 03:16.631
We're worried that you're
happier than us

03:16.674 --> 03:19.242
because she's so foxy.

03:19.286 --> 03:20.461
No.

03:22.245 --> 03:23.986
We're worried
because you are a good,

03:24.029 --> 03:26.728
trusting person,
and Kelly is,

03:26.771 --> 03:28.164
well, the devil.

03:28.208 --> 03:31.559
She will ruin you.
You got to end it with her.

03:31.602 --> 03:34.649
No. I'm grateful for all the
things she brought into my life.

03:34.692 --> 03:37.304
Before her, I never knew
I loved scotch.

03:42.309 --> 03:44.528
Like an angel's tears.

03:47.139 --> 03:51.013
Look, Kelly is my sister, and
I know her better than anyone.

03:51.056 --> 03:53.494
I don't think so.
I know Kelly intimately.

03:53.537 --> 03:56.236
Only 64 other men
in the world can say that.

03:58.455 --> 04:02.633
Boy, it sounds like people are
having a lot of fun out there.

04:02.677 --> 04:04.853
Kelly and I
exchanged stats.

04:04.896 --> 04:07.551
If we compare how many women
we've been with, we're tied.

04:10.511 --> 04:12.687
Okay, fine.
If you won't listen to us,

04:12.730 --> 04:15.994
then listen to him. Dad,
go ahead. Scare him straight.

04:16.038 --> 04:18.214
All right!

04:18.258 --> 04:20.303
Listen here, Lowell.

04:20.347 --> 04:23.872
You've made a lot of changes.
Let's start with the beard.

04:23.915 --> 04:25.177
I like it.

04:26.744 --> 04:28.006
Dad.

04:28.050 --> 04:29.878
I thought we were fixing
the old Lowell,

04:29.921 --> 04:32.184
but this one's hairy
and drinks scotch.

04:33.490 --> 04:35.405
Rolling around town
with a cute broad.

04:35.449 --> 04:38.495
I enjoy you, son.
I used to be you.

04:38.539 --> 04:41.411
Thank you, Joe.

04:41.455 --> 04:45.197
Lowell, I got your text.
Are you okay?

04:45.241 --> 04:47.809
No, they want to break us up.

04:47.852 --> 04:49.463
Is this true?

04:49.506 --> 04:53.336
In our defense, we were trying
to do it behind your back.

04:53.380 --> 04:56.383
Should've known you were coming.
I saw a bat fly by the window.

05:08.917 --> 05:10.440
Why would you try
to break us up?

05:10.484 --> 05:12.790
Look, I don't like
confrontation,

05:12.834 --> 05:15.532
but I'll just come out
and say it. Adam, say it.

05:15.576 --> 05:19.362
I'll say it. You're not
good enough for him.

05:19.406 --> 05:22.191
What with you being
the devil and all.

05:22.234 --> 05:24.498
You know, when I started
dating Lowell,

05:24.541 --> 05:28.023
I wasn't good enough for him,
but he changed me.

05:28.066 --> 05:31.853
I've never had a man
so supportive and tender,

05:31.896 --> 05:36.031
and then not tender when it's
"not tender time."

05:36.074 --> 05:39.208
And there's someone else
I haven't been good enough for,

05:39.251 --> 05:41.863
and that's you, Andi.

05:41.906 --> 05:43.517
I have been a terrible sister,

05:43.560 --> 05:45.867
but I don't want to compete
with you anymore.

05:45.910 --> 05:47.521
I just want to love you.

05:47.564 --> 05:49.392
OTHERS:
Aww!

05:49.436 --> 05:52.003
Aww?

05:53.265 --> 05:56.704
We are not aww-ing,
we're boo-ing.

05:56.747 --> 05:59.184
She's never said anything
like that to me before.

05:59.228 --> 06:01.926
We are supposed
to be a team.

06:01.970 --> 06:03.798
We are a team, but--
I don't know--

06:03.841 --> 06:05.626
we lost them.
Read the room, man.

06:08.106 --> 06:09.281
Okay, well, Lowell,

06:09.325 --> 06:11.327
I have some information
that will show you

06:11.371 --> 06:13.068
what kind of person
Kelly really is.

06:13.111 --> 06:15.636
She told us that
she's just using you

06:15.679 --> 06:17.594
to get an instant family.
Try to deny it.

06:17.638 --> 06:19.553
I don't.She already told me.

06:19.596 --> 06:21.729
I see.

06:23.557 --> 06:26.951
Well, that was my big finish.

06:28.475 --> 06:31.216
Now I got nothing left except
I think you dress too fancy.

06:32.261 --> 06:34.002
Too fancy, am I right, guys?

06:35.482 --> 06:39.137
I like it. She's classy
like Lady Bird Johnson.

06:40.487 --> 06:42.271
Oh, come on.

06:42.314 --> 06:46.536
You guys aren't really buying
this new Kelly, are you?

06:46.580 --> 06:49.234
I admit it's hard to believe,

06:49.278 --> 06:52.716
but without love and honesty,
you can't be happy.

06:52.760 --> 06:54.718
That's just another life lesson

06:54.762 --> 06:57.591
I learned from my
furry little friend.

06:57.634 --> 07:00.985
OTHERS:
Aww!

07:01.029 --> 07:02.857
Stop doing that.

07:02.900 --> 07:04.859
You stop.

07:04.902 --> 07:06.643
Yeah, leave these
two kids alone.

07:06.687 --> 07:08.384
Yeah, why can't you
let people be happy?

07:08.428 --> 07:10.865
You've never done that
once in your life.

07:10.908 --> 07:13.955
I know, but I like to watch it.

07:15.043 --> 07:17.001
Guys, don't
gang up on Adam.

07:17.045 --> 07:20.048
He was just trying to do what he
thought was best for his friend,

07:20.091 --> 07:22.529
and I think
that's amazing.

07:22.572 --> 07:24.618
All right.

07:24.661 --> 07:29.231
This is over. I am intervening
on this intervention.

07:29.274 --> 07:30.493
Everybody go home.

07:30.537 --> 07:32.321
How about a hand

07:32.364 --> 07:33.844
for a very brave man

07:33.888 --> 07:36.717
who stood up for
what he believed in?

07:38.109 --> 07:40.764
Go home, or I'm gonna
call the cops.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.640
Adam, I believe
Kelly's changed.

07:46.683 --> 07:50.034
You believe that because you've
always wanted a sweet sister.

07:50.078 --> 07:53.124
A good con man sells you
what you already want to buy.

07:53.168 --> 07:55.431
Yeah, but if she has

07:55.475 --> 07:58.695
the nice, pretty thing I want
to buy, why can't I buy it?

07:58.739 --> 08:00.741
One of my favorite things
about you

08:00.784 --> 08:02.656
is that you always see
the best in people,

08:02.699 --> 08:05.354
but it's also why you
bought a case of candy bars

08:05.397 --> 08:07.399
from a 30-year-old
claiming to raise money

08:07.443 --> 08:09.706
for his high school
baseball team.

08:09.750 --> 08:12.056
He was dyslexic.
They held him back.

08:12.100 --> 08:13.710
14 times?

08:15.756 --> 08:18.062
You need to wise up, lady.

08:18.106 --> 08:21.805
Okay, i-if you're so wise,
then what's my sister's motive

08:21.849 --> 08:24.634
for pretending to be a good
person and care about Lowell?

08:24.678 --> 08:26.462
She just got fired.

08:26.506 --> 08:29.465
She's looking for
a soft landing, and Lowell

08:29.509 --> 08:32.337
is a walking
marshmallow.

08:32.381 --> 08:35.819
There is no way she's all of
a sudden a different person.

08:35.863 --> 08:39.170
She wasn't completely rotten
when we were kids.

08:39.214 --> 08:41.216
You know, one time she found
a three-legged kitten

08:41.259 --> 08:42.826
and she nursed it
back to health.

08:42.870 --> 08:44.567
Oh, really?
How do you know that kitten

08:44.611 --> 08:46.569
didn't have four legs
when it met her?

08:46.613 --> 08:50.878
Honey, I just don't want
to see you get hurt

08:50.921 --> 08:52.923
when Kelly goes back
to her old ways,

08:52.967 --> 08:56.710
which you know she's gonna do.
She doesn't care about family.

08:56.753 --> 08:58.886
The first time she held
our daughter in her lap,

08:58.929 --> 09:01.236
Katie was ten.

09:01.279 --> 09:04.369
That's too late and weird.

09:04.413 --> 09:07.416
Look, I'm happy to have Kelly
back in my life.

09:07.459 --> 09:11.246
Great, now I got you
and Lowell to worry about.

09:11.289 --> 09:13.378
You know what?
If you won't listen to me,

09:13.422 --> 09:15.685
I'll go find someone else
to talk some sense into you.

09:15.729 --> 09:16.904
Honey.

09:16.947 --> 09:18.558
You're at the bottom of a hole

09:18.601 --> 09:20.211
and you're trying to get out
by digging deeper.

09:20.255 --> 09:22.344
That's the Adam Burns way.

09:22.387 --> 09:25.303
I'll dig so deep I'll hit water
and shoot back up to the top.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.394
"Shoot back up
to the top"?

09:29.438 --> 09:31.962
It's a hole,
not a cartoon fire hydrant.

09:32.006 --> 09:34.225
Will you just talk
to Andi, please?

09:34.269 --> 09:36.401
Tell her you agree with me?

09:36.445 --> 09:38.795
I don't agree with you.
I like Kelly.

09:38.839 --> 09:42.712
I get tired of looking at the
same nine people every day.

09:42.756 --> 09:45.062
Then do it for me
because I'm your son.

09:45.106 --> 09:47.456
Sorry, boy, I'm Team Kelly.

09:48.457 --> 09:50.241
You need somebody
more pliable,

09:50.285 --> 09:51.852
that you can manipulate.

09:52.940 --> 09:53.810
Don!

09:53.854 --> 09:56.639
Just the guy
I'm looking for.

09:56.683 --> 09:58.989
Listen, I'm worried
about Andi,

09:59.033 --> 10:01.078
and I'm worried
about Lowell.

10:01.122 --> 10:05.387
I think you and I need to band
together and get rid of Kelly.

10:05.430 --> 10:07.041
Oh. This is awkward.

10:07.084 --> 10:07.911
What?

10:07.955 --> 10:09.565
Here you go. Oh.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.611
Hey, Adam. Hey.

10:11.654 --> 10:13.264
What's she doing here?

10:13.308 --> 10:15.832
I asked him to take me
to the dog track,

10:15.876 --> 10:17.747
show me the ropes.

10:17.791 --> 10:19.749
She cares about
my interests, Adam.

10:19.793 --> 10:21.229
Plus, she's willing
to say she's a diabetic

10:21.272 --> 10:22.404
to get the good seats.

10:23.710 --> 10:24.928
Oh-ho, you're good.

10:24.972 --> 10:27.017
Nobody cares about
hisinterests.

10:27.061 --> 10:29.716
All right, I'll let you two
have some brother time.

10:29.759 --> 10:31.239
All right,
see you later, Kel-Bell.

10:31.282 --> 10:33.937
Kel-Bell?

10:33.981 --> 10:35.896
Yeah, and she calls me Don-Don.

10:35.939 --> 10:37.680
We're Kel-Bell and Don-Don.

10:37.724 --> 10:39.769
This isn't gonna work.

10:39.813 --> 10:41.597
She already charmed you.

10:41.641 --> 10:44.644
I need somebody with
a heart of stone!

10:44.687 --> 10:47.559
Marcy, there
you are.

10:47.603 --> 10:49.387
I've been looking
all over for you.

10:49.431 --> 10:50.693
Oh, hey, Adam.

10:50.737 --> 10:52.608
Oh, come on.

10:52.652 --> 10:55.611
We just keep
running into each other.

10:55.655 --> 10:56.917
Why are you with her?

10:56.960 --> 10:58.919
Kelly showed up
at my pottery class.

10:58.962 --> 11:01.269
And you don't think
that's suspicious?

11:01.312 --> 11:04.446
It's never suspicious
when someone likes pottery.

11:04.489 --> 11:06.622
It's the world's
oldest hobby.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.624
Isn't that right,
Kellybean?

11:08.668 --> 11:11.279
What happened to Kel-Bell?
You a bell or a bean?

11:11.322 --> 11:13.281
You can call me "sis."

11:13.324 --> 11:14.804
Never.

11:16.153 --> 11:17.328
Wh...?

11:17.372 --> 11:18.634
Seriously?

11:18.678 --> 11:20.505
Oh, hey, Adam.

11:20.549 --> 11:22.159
How did you get
here so quick?

11:22.203 --> 11:24.945
I knew I shouldn't have
stopped at Arby's.

11:24.988 --> 11:27.295
My sister brought me
flowers in a vase

11:27.338 --> 11:29.297
she made herself.

11:29.340 --> 11:30.777
It's just a
little token

11:30.820 --> 11:32.822
to show how much
you mean to me.

11:32.866 --> 11:34.781
Aw, I've missed you,
Kelly-Belly.

11:34.824 --> 11:37.261
Oh, now the bean bell
has a belly.

11:37.305 --> 11:39.611
Well, I better go.

11:39.655 --> 11:42.745
I'm volunteering
at the animal hospital.

11:42.789 --> 11:45.139
Hey, you know who
Adam reminds me of?

11:45.182 --> 11:46.923
That kitten I took in.

11:46.967 --> 11:49.534
He was a brave little guy
just like you.

11:51.319 --> 11:53.800
How many legs that kitten have
when you met it?

11:55.540 --> 11:57.847
Adam, stop it.
She's being sweet.

11:57.891 --> 11:59.806
Let me tell you something.
Look, all day,

11:59.849 --> 12:02.112
I have been going to our friends
to enlist their support,

12:02.156 --> 12:04.506
and you know who's been there
every time doing the same thing?

12:04.549 --> 12:06.551
Kell-Bell, Kellybean,
Kelly Belly!

12:07.857 --> 12:10.033
What kind of crazy person
does that?

12:10.077 --> 12:11.600
You just said you do.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.037
Look--

12:14.081 --> 12:15.473
Come on, honey,
don't you think you're

12:15.517 --> 12:17.432
starting to spin out a little?

12:17.475 --> 12:19.695
I mean, maybe she's just going
to see our friends

12:19.739 --> 12:21.566
because she wants
relationships with them.

12:21.610 --> 12:23.830
Or...

12:23.873 --> 12:25.788
she's tracking me.

12:25.832 --> 12:28.225
I'm under
surveillance, Andi.

12:28.269 --> 12:30.053
What?Tracking devices.

12:30.097 --> 12:32.490
Aren't you listening?

12:32.534 --> 12:33.970
I bet she is.

12:35.929 --> 12:38.061
I'm on to you, Kelly.

12:53.337 --> 12:54.948
What's all this?

12:55.992 --> 12:57.951
Adam, we love you

12:57.994 --> 13:00.562
and we feel like
we're losing you.

13:01.998 --> 13:03.565
What?

13:03.608 --> 13:05.393
It's an intervention, man.

13:05.436 --> 13:08.091
You're too upset
because Kelly's so foxy.

13:09.614 --> 13:11.181
Thanks, Don-Don.

13:12.400 --> 13:14.532
You're having an
intervention for me?

13:14.576 --> 13:16.708
We want to talk about
how you're treating Kelly.

13:16.752 --> 13:20.234
We like Kelly.
We like her more than you.

13:20.277 --> 13:22.540
I appreciate that
you're looking out for me,

13:22.584 --> 13:24.673
but I love being
Kelly's boyfriend.

13:24.716 --> 13:26.849
I'm darn proud to be number 65.Oh.

13:28.242 --> 13:30.548
And I love having
my sister back.

13:30.592 --> 13:31.985
You know how sometimes you just

13:32.028 --> 13:33.900
go along with things
to make me happy?

13:33.943 --> 13:35.553
Do that now.

13:35.597 --> 13:39.688
Okay, if she's so wonderful now
and really cares about Lowell,

13:39.731 --> 13:41.733
then she'll be able to answer
a simple question about him.

13:41.777 --> 13:43.866
Kelly, when's Lowell's birthday?

13:43.910 --> 13:45.476
February 11.

13:45.520 --> 13:46.869
February 11, huh?

13:46.913 --> 13:48.697
Is that right, Lowell?

13:50.264 --> 13:52.527
I don't know, is it, Adam?

13:52.570 --> 13:56.183
Okay, I got out
over my skis on that one.

13:56.226 --> 13:57.532
How about this?

13:57.575 --> 13:58.881
When is Andi's birthday?

13:58.925 --> 14:00.013
June 15.

14:00.056 --> 14:02.319
You better not ask
me if that's right.

14:02.363 --> 14:05.061
Okay, this is a waste of time.

14:05.105 --> 14:08.499
I know I know what I know
and I'm not wrong about her.

14:08.543 --> 14:10.066
You're all the wrong ones.

14:10.110 --> 14:11.328
Wrong, wrong, wrong,

14:11.372 --> 14:13.548
wrong, evil, wrong.
Right!

14:17.030 --> 14:20.642
That intervention
was a dirty trick.

14:20.685 --> 14:23.210
Hey, you were talking
to flowers.

14:23.253 --> 14:25.516
I mean, they put people
in hospitals for that.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.605
I'm sorry.

14:27.649 --> 14:29.738
I just don't believe
people change.

14:31.044 --> 14:32.915
You did.
What?

14:32.959 --> 14:34.351
Before we got married,

14:34.395 --> 14:36.136
you never talked
about your feelings.

14:36.179 --> 14:38.965
Well, I don't want
to talk about that.

14:39.008 --> 14:40.705
And you had a hard time
admitting when you were wrong.

14:40.749 --> 14:43.186
I disagree.

14:43.230 --> 14:46.146
And you had a real black
shoe, white sock problem.

14:46.189 --> 14:48.409
I was into Michael Jackson.

14:50.193 --> 14:52.239
But I stuck with it
too long.

14:53.544 --> 14:55.503
Right, when you see
evidence that you're wrong,

14:55.546 --> 14:57.157
you-you always
come around.

14:57.200 --> 14:59.550
So give Kelly a chance.

14:59.594 --> 15:01.204
Oh, God...

15:05.948 --> 15:07.254
I'll think about it.

15:09.821 --> 15:10.997
Hey, Kelly.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.520
Uh, thanks
for stopping by.

15:12.563 --> 15:14.609
Uh, here,
have a seat.

15:14.652 --> 15:15.958
No problem.

15:16.002 --> 15:19.353
The new me always comes
when family calls.

15:19.396 --> 15:21.442
But I hope you're not gonna
say anything hurtful,

15:21.485 --> 15:23.705
because the new me's heart
is much more sensitive.

15:23.748 --> 15:25.185
Oh, no, no.

15:25.228 --> 15:26.969
No, actually...

15:27.013 --> 15:28.666
I wanted to apologize.

15:28.710 --> 15:30.712
A-And as a peace offering,

15:30.755 --> 15:32.192
I got you some hummus.

15:32.235 --> 15:35.282
Which, I am told, is
yogurt for fancy people.

15:36.892 --> 15:38.633
Here's a spoon.

15:38.676 --> 15:43.159
Oh, I just had
a tub of hummus, but thanks.

15:44.247 --> 15:45.901
Ah, o-okay.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.729
Well, okay,
here's the thing.

15:47.772 --> 15:48.991
Um...

15:49.035 --> 15:53.343
I was judging you
on past behavior

15:53.387 --> 15:56.999
and Andi pointed out
that people can change.

15:57.043 --> 15:59.697
So, I wanted
to look you in the eye

15:59.741 --> 16:02.570
and tell you I'm sorry.

16:02.613 --> 16:04.180
Thank you.

16:04.224 --> 16:05.703
That really means a lot.

16:05.747 --> 16:08.532
Good. A-And, and I hope
we can put all this

16:08.576 --> 16:10.360
behind us and start fresh.

16:10.404 --> 16:11.796
Of course.

16:11.840 --> 16:13.363
We're family.

16:13.407 --> 16:16.105
We're gonna be
in each other's lives forever.

16:16.149 --> 16:17.977
And it's just nice
to think that

16:18.020 --> 16:21.197
when I sit across from you
at Thanksgiving,

16:21.241 --> 16:23.373
I will know...

16:23.417 --> 16:25.419
that I owned you.

16:29.249 --> 16:30.424
What?

16:30.467 --> 16:33.514
I got to admit,
you were tough.

16:33.557 --> 16:35.864
I knew after
the intervention

16:35.907 --> 16:38.736
that you were the only one
that wouldn't buy the new me.

16:38.780 --> 16:40.695
I haven't changed at all.

16:40.738 --> 16:44.264
In fact, I'm probably
a little worse.

16:46.831 --> 16:48.094
So I was right.

16:48.137 --> 16:51.053
Yeah, but I got you
acting so crazy

16:51.097 --> 16:53.360
that you've lost
all credibility.

16:53.403 --> 16:55.536
Which is why
I feel comfortable

16:55.579 --> 16:57.712
sharing the truth
with you now.

16:57.755 --> 17:00.062
No one will believe you.

17:02.847 --> 17:04.197
Wow.

17:05.937 --> 17:08.157
That's right.
Drink it in.

17:08.201 --> 17:10.638
Oh, and another thing.

17:10.681 --> 17:14.424
Hummus isn't yogurt,
you country bumpkin.

17:15.686 --> 17:19.734
Oh, well, um, I'm sorry,
I-I didn't know, I...

17:20.996 --> 17:23.390
Well, since you didn't eat it,
I guess...

17:23.433 --> 17:25.392
I'll just make you
eat your words.

17:29.744 --> 17:31.659
Andi.

17:31.702 --> 17:34.618
Maybe you did
pull that kitten's leg off.

17:36.707 --> 17:40.494
I-- He thinks he tricked me,
but I knew you were in there.

17:40.537 --> 17:43.018
I just said that stuff

17:43.062 --> 17:45.760
so you could see that he didn't
really mean his apology.

17:45.803 --> 17:47.544
He drugged me.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.375
This is so fun.

17:53.507 --> 17:56.901
You see, what I did was,
I convinced Andi

17:56.945 --> 18:00.035
to listen to make sure
I did a good job apologizing.

18:00.079 --> 18:02.342
But I knew
you couldn't resist

18:02.385 --> 18:04.083
rubbing it in
once I caved.

18:04.126 --> 18:06.215
People don't change.

18:06.259 --> 18:08.391
I wear white socks
when you go out of town.

18:10.219 --> 18:12.091
Adam Burns for the win.

18:13.222 --> 18:14.876
Yeah, that's right.
You may have fooled me,

18:14.919 --> 18:17.313
but the man I married is
pathologically suspicious

18:17.357 --> 18:19.837
and sometimes
that comes in handy.
Mm-hmm.

18:19.881 --> 18:22.536
And I know what hummus is.

18:22.579 --> 18:25.191
I was just trying to make
you eat it 'cause it's expired.

18:26.757 --> 18:28.933
Now everyone
will believe me.

18:28.977 --> 18:31.022
And-- Wait.
Where's Don and Marcy?

18:31.066 --> 18:32.937
I told them to wait
in the pantry, too.

18:36.202 --> 18:38.073
How much longer do we
have to be in here?

18:39.553 --> 18:40.858
I don't know.

18:40.902 --> 18:42.599
Adam just said
wait in the pantry.

18:50.607 --> 18:52.696
Lowell, we're sorry Kelly's
not who you thought she was.

18:52.740 --> 18:55.351
Thank you.Yeah.

18:55.395 --> 18:58.311
Maybe during this difficult
time, you'll find some comfort

18:58.354 --> 19:00.530
in the fact
that I was right all along.

19:01.575 --> 19:03.185
I can't believe this.

19:03.229 --> 19:05.187
I changed so much for her.

19:05.231 --> 19:06.710
I grew hair on my face

19:06.754 --> 19:09.322
and got rid of it
everywhere else.

19:09.365 --> 19:12.934
My whole body's
a five-o'clock shadow right now.

19:13.935 --> 19:16.546
Lowell.

19:16.590 --> 19:18.113
Kelly.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.115
I've come to say good-bye.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.378
I meant what I said.

19:22.422 --> 19:24.641
I haveloved our time together.

19:24.685 --> 19:28.079
Is not being a good person
really a deal breaker?

19:29.298 --> 19:30.952
Historically,
it's been important.

19:32.127 --> 19:33.911
Although you set
a high bar sexually,

19:33.955 --> 19:36.958
so maybe from time to time
we could just...

19:37.001 --> 19:38.089
No.

19:38.133 --> 19:39.482
Maybe just sexy Skype?ADAM: No.

19:39.526 --> 19:42.703
Lowell, go upstairs
while we secure the premises.

19:42.746 --> 19:44.879
Maybe use my razor and shave.

19:44.922 --> 19:47.273
Just the face.

19:48.317 --> 19:49.927
I'll be outside.

19:49.971 --> 19:52.800
I am very sorry
for all the hurt I...

19:52.843 --> 19:55.585
Oh, wait, I don't have
to be nice anymore. Bye.

19:58.109 --> 20:00.068
Well, you were right.

20:00.111 --> 20:02.201
She is never gonna change.

20:02.244 --> 20:04.464
Yeah. You can't pick
your family.

20:04.507 --> 20:07.031
You are stuck with them.

20:07.075 --> 20:10.121
But the good news is
I got to pick you,

20:10.165 --> 20:13.081
and I definitely got
the good sister.
Aw.

20:13.124 --> 20:16.084
And only 96 other
men can say that.

20:16.127 --> 20:18.042
Hmm. What?

20:18.086 --> 20:19.566
I'm kidding.

20:19.609 --> 20:21.220
That's not funny.
I don't like that.
