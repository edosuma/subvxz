00:19.419 --> 00:23.623
Hey, you! Stay there! Stop!

00:23.690 --> 00:26.626
-Get after him!
-Yeah,
shout at him, brilliant!

00:29.729 --> 00:32.432
-You found anything?
-Got it! In there!

00:33.833 --> 00:36.870
Stop! Please! I can help you!

00:41.441 --> 00:42.509
Please!

00:45.145 --> 00:48.848
It's okay.
You're safe. You're safe!

00:50.984 --> 00:56.956
A time fissure.
We're staring into time.
It's beautiful.

00:57.023 --> 00:59.459
That poor boy
must have wandered in
and ended up here.

00:59.526 --> 01:02.796
It's happened before.
Missing people, lost in time.

01:02.862 --> 01:08.234
But if we stepped
through there, we could
travel in time. Amazing!

01:08.301 --> 01:09.936
Uh-uh! It's not safe.

01:11.271 --> 01:13.406
We'll send the kid home.

01:13.473 --> 01:17.177
Then I'll use the converter
to reduce the energy ratio
and close the gap. I hope.

01:17.243 --> 01:19.546
Like a time
puncture repair kit?

01:20.680 --> 01:22.982
Yeah. Exactly like.

01:23.049 --> 01:25.618
-Sarah Jane! We got him.
-RANI: What's going on?

01:25.685 --> 01:28.354
Don't worry,
everything's
going to be all right.

01:28.421 --> 01:32.158
-Hello. What's your name?
-Oscar. Who are you lot?

01:32.225 --> 01:34.294
-Where am I?
-Don't worry about that.

01:34.360 --> 01:36.062
You're going home, Oscar.

01:39.232 --> 01:41.067
Just step through.
You'll be safe.

01:41.134 --> 01:42.902
There's nothing
to be scared of.

01:42.969 --> 01:45.805
-Go through.
I promise you'll be safe.
-No.

01:46.706 --> 01:47.740
I'm scared.

01:48.641 --> 01:50.143
-(BEEPS)
-Luke.

01:50.210 --> 01:53.146
Come on,
it's all going to be fine.

01:53.947 --> 01:55.081
I promise you.

01:56.449 --> 01:57.884
Back in two ticks.

02:06.860 --> 02:08.794
And this is home, yes?

02:08.862 --> 02:13.600
Yes. I was just going
for a walk, suddenly I was
in that strange place.

02:13.666 --> 02:16.169
Forget it ever happened.
Forget me. Okay?

02:22.041 --> 02:24.744
No. No, it can't be.

02:26.946 --> 02:31.751
-What's
the name of that place?
-Foxgrove. It's where I live.

02:31.818 --> 02:34.320
What year is this?
Please tell me the date.

02:34.387 --> 02:37.891
It's 1951. July, 1951.

02:38.791 --> 02:41.628
No! Go, go, go!

02:45.832 --> 02:46.966
No.

02:48.134 --> 02:50.537
Oh, no,
you don't, Sarah Jane Smith.

03:01.814 --> 03:03.950
Did I do it properly, sir?

03:04.017 --> 03:07.353
You did it beautifully.

03:07.420 --> 03:13.660
Soon, I will do battle
once more with
Sarah Jane Smith.

03:13.726 --> 03:18.364
She will return here,
the one time and place

03:18.431 --> 03:20.433
that she cannot resist.

03:20.500 --> 03:25.838
And this time,
the triumph shall be mine!

03:25.905 --> 03:27.907
(LAUGHING)

03:44.490 --> 03:47.694
-How did it go?
-Fine, just fine.
I sent Oscar home.

03:47.760 --> 03:50.964
-What about you? How are you?
-Fine. Why shouldn't I be?

03:51.030 --> 03:52.599
What's on
the other side of that?

03:52.665 --> 03:54.701
Yeah, what was it like?
Did you see anything?

03:54.767 --> 03:57.837
Nothing much.
This place used
to be countryside.

03:57.904 --> 04:00.340
Right, better close it up.

04:00.406 --> 04:03.543
We could go through there
into another time.

04:03.610 --> 04:06.145
We might never get
the chance again.

04:06.212 --> 04:08.381
Can't we just have a look?
Five minutes?

04:08.448 --> 04:11.718
No. I'm sorry, Clyde.
But it's too dangerous.

04:11.784 --> 04:13.586
Have you seen it
in the movies?

04:13.653 --> 04:16.656
You go back,
change one tiny thing,
it has terrible consequences.

04:16.723 --> 04:18.825
But you've
travelled through time
in the TARDIS.

04:18.891 --> 04:22.362
With the Doctor, who knew
what he was doing,
most of the time.

04:22.428 --> 04:25.031
This is different
and I'm closing it up forever.

04:28.468 --> 04:30.403
Job done. Let's go home.

04:47.153 --> 04:48.821
-Bye, Sarah Jane.
-Yeah.

04:48.888 --> 04:51.324
-See you tomorrow?
-Bye, Rani.

04:51.391 --> 04:53.026
She's no good at hiding
how she feels, is she?

04:53.092 --> 04:55.061
She said she was fine.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.497
She spent the whole ride
back staring straight ahead,
not saying anything.

04:57.563 --> 04:59.999
She didn't even complain
when Steve Wright
came on the radio.

05:00.066 --> 05:01.901
Yeah, not even when
he played the Hoosiers.

05:01.968 --> 05:04.070
Something happened
when she went back in time.

05:04.137 --> 05:07.140
And it's up to you,
my young Padawan,
to find out the whole story.

05:08.341 --> 05:09.409
<i>Ciao.</i>

05:13.312 --> 05:17.150
MR SMITH:
<i>The energy spike registers</i>
<i>minimal activity, Sarah Jane.</i>

05:17.216 --> 05:20.620
<i>-The fissure is</i>
<i>no longer active.</i>
-Thank you, Mr Smith.

05:23.423 --> 05:26.959
Can you give me the details
of the area over
the last century?

05:27.026 --> 05:29.962
In particular,
a village called Foxgrove.

05:30.029 --> 05:32.432
<i>The village of</i>
<i>Foxgrove was sited here.</i>

05:32.498 --> 05:35.702
<i>It was mainly noted</i>
<i>for the ruins of</i>
<i>a Cistercian abbey.</i>

05:35.768 --> 05:39.806
<i>The entire village was</i>
<i>demolished in 1964 to make</i>
<i>way for an A road.</i>

05:39.872 --> 05:43.276
<i>The area now comprises</i>
<i>housing on the edges</i>
<i>of the Broughton New Town.</i>

05:43.342 --> 05:48.781
It's right there.
Oh, why didn't I realise?

05:48.848 --> 05:51.617
<i>I'm sorry, Sarah Jane,</i>
<i>I don't understand</i>
<i>your question.</i>

05:51.684 --> 05:55.655
-I was talking to myself.
<i>-I see. Sorry I spoke.</i>

05:55.722 --> 05:58.991
<i>Sarah Jane, forgive me,</i>
<i>but is there anything</i>
<i>else I can help you with?</i>

05:59.058 --> 06:00.960
-No, thanks.
<i>-Are you sure?</i>

06:02.562 --> 06:04.063
Positive! Goodbye for now!

06:23.816 --> 06:25.985
Oh, no, you don't, my girl.

06:27.153 --> 06:30.022
I can't.
I mustn't. And I won't.

06:31.390 --> 06:33.960
Mum? What's the matter?

06:34.160 --> 06:38.064
I'm fine!
Why is everybody asking
if there's anything wrong?

06:38.131 --> 06:40.900
Rani, you, even the computer.

06:40.967 --> 06:43.903
I've gotta say, Mum, you're
very, very unconvincing.

06:43.970 --> 06:46.005
Oh! It's that bad?

06:47.106 --> 06:48.908
Oh, Luke, I'm sorry.

06:50.443 --> 06:51.511
LUKE: Who are they?

06:52.945 --> 06:54.881
Barbara and Eddie Smith.

06:55.782 --> 06:56.883
My mum and dad.

06:58.851 --> 07:02.054
LUKE: They died when you
were just a baby.

07:02.121 --> 07:04.157
What exactly happened?

07:04.223 --> 07:06.859
We lived in
a village called Foxgrove.

07:06.926 --> 07:09.028
That's where I was born.

07:09.095 --> 07:11.631
One afternoon,
in August, 1951,

07:11.697 --> 07:14.534
they got in their car,
drove off,
and they never came back.

07:14.600 --> 07:16.469
There was an accident?

07:16.536 --> 07:19.806
A tractor had
broken down in the lane.
They went straight into it.

07:21.707 --> 07:23.643
You got out okay.

07:23.709 --> 07:26.579
I wasn't with them.
They left me behind,

07:26.646 --> 07:30.116
in my pram, at the side
of the road, alone.

07:30.183 --> 07:32.318
They must have had a reason.

07:32.385 --> 07:35.454
To leave
a three-month-old baby
on its own?

07:36.589 --> 07:38.958
So your Aunt
Lavinia brought you up?

07:39.025 --> 07:42.995
Dad's sister,
the family genius.
She did the best she could.

07:43.062 --> 07:46.766
But she was always so busy.
Never in one place long enough
to lick a stamp.

07:46.833 --> 07:51.070
She always said my mum and dad
were the best
parents in the world.

07:51.137 --> 07:55.174
But I couldn't help thinking,
"Was she
covering up for them?"

07:55.241 --> 07:58.911
Because that day
they just upped
and left their baby alone.

07:58.978 --> 08:01.113
Left me behind.

08:01.180 --> 08:02.715
Where were they going
in the car?

08:02.782 --> 08:04.984
Nobody knew.
They just took off.

08:07.820 --> 08:09.956
I've never told anybody this.

08:11.023 --> 08:13.759
Not even the Doctor.

08:13.826 --> 08:16.829
All these years,
I've tried to forget,
to pretend it didn't matter.

08:16.896 --> 08:19.465
And then, today,
we found that time fissure.

08:19.532 --> 08:22.702
It leads right
there to Foxgrove,

08:22.768 --> 08:26.505
July, 1951,
a month before they died.

08:26.572 --> 08:29.675
I actually saw the village.

08:29.742 --> 08:33.712
-My mum and dad,
they're down there.
-You want to go back.

08:33.779 --> 08:37.482
Well, why not?
Just for a moment,
just to see them?

08:39.784 --> 08:45.725
I can't! Stepping back
in time into your own
past is so dangerous.

08:47.326 --> 08:49.962
And think about it.
It's all too convenient.

08:51.697 --> 08:55.001
-It could be a trap.
-Or a coincidence.

08:55.067 --> 09:00.206
No, it must be a trap,
which is another
reason for not going.

09:00.273 --> 09:03.676
Somebody's been very clever,
but not clever enough.

09:03.743 --> 09:06.679
They've put the idea
in my head,
put the bait on the hook,

09:06.746 --> 09:08.881
but this one's not biting.
I'm strong enough to say no.

09:40.780 --> 09:42.815
I must be out of my mind.

09:54.260 --> 09:58.831
Mum, I know where you're going
and I'm coming with you.

09:58.898 --> 10:00.299
No, I won't let you risk it.

10:00.366 --> 10:02.501
I just want to make sure
you're all right.

10:02.568 --> 10:03.903
Oh, Luke.

10:07.573 --> 10:09.175
Not a school
night either, is it?

10:09.241 --> 10:12.411
Straight there, straight back
and we won't tell anybody.

10:14.347 --> 10:16.515
-Where did you
get the clothes?
-Back of my wardrobe.

10:16.582 --> 10:19.118
Simple,
classic, it'll do the job.

10:19.185 --> 10:20.886
You used to wear that?

10:21.887 --> 10:23.356
Seriously?

10:23.422 --> 10:25.558
Listen, kid,
the '50s came
back in the '70s.

10:25.624 --> 10:28.060
I remember when this
was quite the thing.

10:35.301 --> 10:36.769
(DEVICE BEEPING)

10:40.206 --> 10:43.009
I can still change my mind.
I can still walk away.

10:44.910 --> 10:47.546
I could meet myself as a baby.
That's so dangerous.

10:47.613 --> 10:49.982
If I touched her,
there could be
a huge explosion.

10:50.049 --> 10:54.220
But you know that,
so you won't.
It's your choice.

10:54.286 --> 10:56.822
It's only dangerous
if you change something.

10:56.889 --> 10:58.724
And you're not going to.

10:58.791 --> 11:02.061
-What would you do?
-I'd go.
Any normal person would.

11:03.362 --> 11:05.498
I think even I'm normal enough
to know that.

11:05.564 --> 11:09.802
And if it is a trap, this is
the only way to find out
who's behind it.

11:09.869 --> 11:13.506
That sounds like a good,
rational reason I can
give myself anyway.

11:15.741 --> 11:17.543
There you go.

11:17.610 --> 11:21.981
Thank you. You know something?
You're brilliant.

11:27.019 --> 11:29.188
The fissure should stay open
for about an hour,

11:29.255 --> 11:31.123
but I'll be back before then.

11:34.326 --> 11:37.463
Mum, it's closing. No! Mum!

11:42.201 --> 11:44.703
(LAUGHING)
<i>The trap is closing.</i>

11:47.840 --> 11:50.242
Luke!
What on earth are you doing?

11:50.309 --> 11:52.878
I had to come through.
It was closing up.
I had no choice!

11:52.945 --> 11:56.515
-It's gone, Mum.
-Don't panic.
Give me the converter.

11:56.582 --> 12:00.186
It's okay.
Time fissures,
they can be erratic.

12:00.252 --> 12:04.590
But it's still active,
I can open it again.
We can get back.

12:04.657 --> 12:07.860
We're back in time. 1951.

12:08.894 --> 12:12.064
It's incredible. It's daytime!

12:12.131 --> 12:15.401
That's time travel.
Jet lag you wouldn't believe.

12:16.368 --> 12:17.703
LUKE: The village.

12:18.604 --> 12:20.339
You should go back.

12:20.406 --> 12:23.576
Mind you,
every time I use this,
it weakens the link.

12:23.642 --> 12:26.312
Oh, well. Now you're here,
you might as well
come with me.

12:26.378 --> 12:28.214
LUKE: Is that okay?

12:28.280 --> 12:30.583
SARAH JANE:
You're part of the family,
too, aren't you?

12:30.649 --> 12:32.618
She did it.

12:33.853 --> 12:35.020
(DOORBELL RINGING)

12:36.889 --> 12:37.890
Come on.

12:41.494 --> 12:42.561
Luke!

12:46.265 --> 12:47.533
Lukey-boy!

12:54.573 --> 12:58.177
Rani! Rani!

12:58.244 --> 13:01.313
RANI: Mum, it's a Saturday!

13:01.380 --> 13:03.849
-You've got a visitor.
-RANI: What?

13:04.783 --> 13:07.520
I'm having a lie-in!

13:07.586 --> 13:12.558
Can't keep trouble away.
Good job your
dad didn't see him.

13:12.625 --> 13:16.061
Their phones are off
and me and Luke
are meeting up.

13:16.128 --> 13:18.164
He never, ever forgets.

13:19.431 --> 13:21.233
I tell you,
my Clydey sense is tingling.

13:21.300 --> 13:25.304
-They might've just gone out.
-Or what if Sarah Jane's
been grabbed?

13:25.371 --> 13:28.073
Right. We'll make a list
of all her enemies.

13:28.140 --> 13:31.110
Great idea.
Shouldn't take us
more than 15 years.

13:31.177 --> 13:32.845
Mr Smith, I need you!

13:39.185 --> 13:40.819
Where are Sarah Jane
and Luke?

13:40.886 --> 13:42.354
MR SMITH:
<i>I have no information.</i>

13:42.421 --> 13:44.523
Come on, did she say
where they've gone?

13:44.590 --> 13:46.625
<i>No, Rani. She did not.</i>

13:46.692 --> 13:50.596
See! That's weird.
What if it's aliens?

13:50.663 --> 13:53.199
They've been abducted.
They could be
being probed right now.

13:53.265 --> 13:55.968
<i>There are no signs</i>
<i>of alien activity.</i>
<i>In fact...</i>

13:56.168 --> 13:58.404
In fact what? Spit it out.

13:58.470 --> 14:00.506
<i>It is not my</i>
<i>function to venture opinion</i>

14:00.573 --> 14:03.108
<i>or to prognosticate</i>
<i>the behaviour of humans.</i>

14:03.175 --> 14:07.046
<i>But I have</i>
<i>a theory about where</i>
<i>they've gone. Or rather, when.</i>

14:07.880 --> 14:09.281
Oh...

14:09.348 --> 14:11.483
Didn't like how
that sentence ended up.

14:11.550 --> 14:13.752
Mr Smith, give us your theory.

14:13.819 --> 14:17.056
<i>Sarah Jane was born here,</i>
<i>in the village of Foxgrove.</i>

14:17.122 --> 14:20.960
<i>She lived there as</i>
<i>a baby at the exact period</i>
<i>to which the fissure leads.</i>

14:21.026 --> 14:23.395
Her mum and dad!
They were alive then.

14:23.462 --> 14:26.265
-She's gone back to see them.
-Whoa! Obvious trap!

14:26.332 --> 14:28.701
Like if it was you,
you wouldn't go?

14:28.767 --> 14:31.203
<i>Information.</i>
<i>Energy pulse detected.</i>

14:31.270 --> 14:33.072
-Energy pulse? Where?
<i>-Behind you.</i>

14:34.373 --> 14:35.441
(BEEPING)

14:35.507 --> 14:37.543
Oh, no. Bad news.

14:38.244 --> 14:39.778
Tell me.

14:39.845 --> 14:42.281
Last year, some really
weird stuff went down.

14:42.348 --> 14:44.116
I never got my head 'round it.

14:44.183 --> 14:48.754
But some alien thing
took Sarah Jane
out of time completely.

14:48.821 --> 14:52.558
But Maria could
still remember her
because she had this box.

14:52.625 --> 14:56.962
It protects you against some
other alien, little midget
thing, the Graske.

14:57.029 --> 14:59.698
And bad time
things in general.

14:59.765 --> 15:01.967
How does it protect you?

15:02.167 --> 15:07.139
I don't know.
With its boxy goodness?

15:07.206 --> 15:10.376
We can remember Sarah Jane
and Luke, nothing's changed.

15:10.442 --> 15:12.778
Something's
making it flash though.

15:12.845 --> 15:14.780
We've gotta get
after them, warn them.

15:15.681 --> 15:17.750
She'll have taken
the converter.

15:17.816 --> 15:19.285
We can't get
through the fissure.

15:19.351 --> 15:21.020
We can try and that
might help us.

15:21.086 --> 15:22.755
It's only half
an hour on the train.

15:29.295 --> 15:30.629
Nobody about.

15:33.332 --> 15:36.402
Look, they must be down there.

15:38.070 --> 15:39.071
Come on then.

15:43.709 --> 15:46.145
I just want to look.
I just want to see them,
that's all.

15:46.211 --> 15:47.880
I know. Me, too.

15:49.048 --> 15:50.816
(LAUGHING)

15:50.883 --> 15:52.785
But, Luke, they abandoned me.
What kind of people are they?

15:52.851 --> 15:56.488
-Do I really want
to know the answer?
-You can't turn back now.

15:59.625 --> 16:03.362
MRS KING: <i>Everybody,</i>
<i>could I have your attention,</i>
<i>please?</i>

16:03.429 --> 16:09.068
<i>The raffle prizes</i>
<i>will be announced</i>
<i>at 5:00 sharp. Thank you!</i>

16:11.704 --> 16:14.873
LUKE: These people,
they look so excited.

16:14.940 --> 16:18.243
SARAH JANE: It's 1951.
They're still on rations
after the war.

16:18.310 --> 16:21.747
No mobile phones, no TV.

16:21.814 --> 16:25.351
I see.
This is what old people call
making your own entertainment.

16:25.417 --> 16:26.985
BARBARA: Sarah Jane!

16:28.253 --> 16:31.623
Look what Mummy's got for you,
Sarah Jane.

16:32.725 --> 16:34.660
It's her, my mum.

16:34.727 --> 16:36.562
(BABY CRYING)

16:36.628 --> 16:38.864
Sarah Jane.

16:38.931 --> 16:43.102
-And that must be...
-I know. Me.

16:47.573 --> 16:49.842
Looks like a pretty good mum.

16:49.908 --> 16:52.911
-So why did she leave me?
-You can hardly go up and ask.

16:54.546 --> 16:57.549
-I can if I'm careful.
-That wasn't the plan.

16:57.616 --> 16:59.118
You wanted to see her.
Now you have.

16:59.184 --> 17:02.888
Plans change. It's her.
My mum.

17:04.723 --> 17:07.859
-Hello.
-Oh, hello.

17:07.925 --> 17:11.829
Sorry. I thought you were...
I thought I knew you.

17:11.896 --> 17:15.634
Oh, that's all right.
Lovely baby.

17:15.701 --> 17:19.204
Yeah, thanks, she is. Come on.

17:19.271 --> 17:21.906
Guess how many gobstoppers
in there, penny a go.

17:25.444 --> 17:29.181
I'd say it was 676.

17:29.248 --> 17:33.085
-You what? What did you say?
-676.

17:33.152 --> 17:35.220
If you take the cubic volume
of the jar in centimetres,

17:35.287 --> 17:36.955
then divide by
the size of each sweet,

17:37.022 --> 17:39.458
allowing for the approximate
spaces in between.

17:39.525 --> 17:41.660
Just put your name down there.

17:42.928 --> 17:45.497
Centimetres?
You from abroad?

17:45.564 --> 17:47.900
No. We're from London.
What's she called?

17:48.667 --> 17:49.902
Sarah Jane.

17:51.303 --> 17:53.772
-You look like you adore her.
-Yeah.

17:55.174 --> 17:57.643
Eddie!
Made it eventually then?

17:57.709 --> 17:59.878
Oh, had to leave the car up
by the memorial.

17:59.945 --> 18:02.080
Ruddy horse box parked
outside the house.

18:02.147 --> 18:04.082
-Hello.
-EDDIE: Hello, strangers.

18:04.149 --> 18:07.419
Welcome to the village fete.
Fate worse than death!

18:07.486 --> 18:09.021
You staying over the pub?

18:09.221 --> 18:10.823
No, just passing through.
A little holiday.

18:10.889 --> 18:13.358
Oh, well, lovely day for it.

18:13.425 --> 18:17.396
-Eddie Smith.
-I'm... I'm Victoria Beckham.

18:17.463 --> 18:19.965
-And I'm David Beckham.
-Nice to meet you.

18:20.165 --> 18:21.533
I'm Barbara.

18:21.600 --> 18:24.436
How's my little darling?
She been behaving herself?

18:24.503 --> 18:27.372
BARBARA: Quiet as a lamb.
EDDIE: Beautiful, ain't she?

18:27.439 --> 18:31.276
Oh, Mrs King says
can you help out in the tent?
They're a bit shorthanded.

18:31.343 --> 18:33.645
-Go on, I'll mind the stall.
-Righty-o.

18:33.712 --> 18:36.415
Bye-bye, bye-bye.

18:36.482 --> 18:38.617
I'll help out if you like.
If you need another
pair of hands.

18:38.684 --> 18:40.319
No, that's all right.

18:40.385 --> 18:41.920
-Oh, I like to make
myself useful.
-Mum, are you sure?

18:41.987 --> 18:44.590
-We should be
getting back soon.
-I'll only be a moment.

18:44.656 --> 18:47.759
-Okay.
-SARAH JANE: Meet you
back at the square.

18:47.826 --> 18:51.897
EDDIE: How many sweets in
the jar? Come on,
lovely prizes, step up.

19:07.813 --> 19:12.184
Thank you so much, Mrs Smith.
We can always rely on you.

19:12.251 --> 19:15.254
That's all right, Mrs King.

19:15.320 --> 19:18.590
Where's Mr Beckham today then?
Your husband?

19:18.657 --> 19:20.192
I'm not married.

19:20.259 --> 19:22.794
-But David's your son?
-I adopted him.

19:22.861 --> 19:25.030
You can adopt
even if you're on your own?

19:25.097 --> 19:28.233
-I thought you
couldn't do that.
-You going to have more kids?

19:28.300 --> 19:30.536
A couple more.
That's always been the plan.

19:30.602 --> 19:34.506
Don't want her
growing up on her own,
nobody to play with.

19:34.573 --> 19:38.277
Here, I was doing this
when I first met Eddie.

19:38.343 --> 19:40.445
In a canteen, um,
or something?

19:41.246 --> 19:42.948
The NAAFI, yeah.

19:43.015 --> 19:47.753
Eddie came in every afternoon,
3:00 on the dot,

19:47.819 --> 19:50.455
milky tea and a teacake.

19:50.522 --> 19:54.626
He used to leave
me silly notes,
"Miss Wilson, be mine."

19:54.693 --> 19:56.495
"Miss Wilson, I adore you."

19:56.562 --> 20:01.500
Then, one day, "Miss Wilson,
will you be Mrs Smith?"

20:01.567 --> 20:03.802
So I sent one back,
"Mr Smith, I will".

20:06.605 --> 20:08.574
We still do it, look.

20:11.777 --> 20:16.515
"Mrs Smith, chips for tea,
please." You probably think
we're soft, Victoria.

20:16.582 --> 20:18.550
I don't. I think it's lovely.

20:21.486 --> 20:22.921
(DEVICE BEEPING)

20:26.024 --> 20:29.561
The fissure's closed.
Try the box.

20:29.628 --> 20:32.431
-What am I supposed to do?
-I don't know. Hold it up.

20:36.602 --> 20:37.903
Hocus pocus!

20:39.671 --> 20:40.906
Open sesame!

20:42.140 --> 20:44.409
Oh, I don't know.
(GASPS) Jumanji!

20:47.980 --> 20:53.085
-I feel like a right fool.
-Look at that.
It's going crazy.

20:53.151 --> 20:55.020
It's trying to
tell us something.

20:57.889 --> 21:00.058
Watch out, here comes madam.

21:05.130 --> 21:09.735
Look at her. So peaceful.
What's she thinking?

21:09.801 --> 21:12.504
Thinking about
her tea, I reckon.

21:12.571 --> 21:15.073
Eddie thinks
she's gonna turn out
like his sister,

21:15.140 --> 21:18.944
-the brain of Britain.
-I'm sure
she'll turn out fine.

21:19.011 --> 21:22.147
You wonder sometimes though,
don't you, Victoria?

21:22.214 --> 21:24.983
What kind of world
is she gonna grow up in?

21:25.050 --> 21:26.785
Russians and the Yanks

21:26.852 --> 21:29.888
letting off H-bombs
left, right and centre.

21:29.955 --> 21:34.359
All these men with big ideas
on how to live your life.

21:34.426 --> 21:36.995
I think the future
will be better than that.

21:37.062 --> 21:38.897
Well, that's why
we moved out here.

21:38.964 --> 21:42.901
You see, our generation,
we had all the upheaval,
the danger.

21:42.968 --> 21:46.071
But Sarah Jane's gonna have
a better life.

21:46.138 --> 21:49.241
She's the best
little girl in the world.

21:49.307 --> 21:52.177
We'll always be there for you,
won't we, darling?

21:52.244 --> 21:56.148
I'd better go.
It was nice meeting you.

21:56.214 --> 21:59.584
No, it was incredible.
Goodbye.

22:03.021 --> 22:04.456
She's a funny one.

22:17.969 --> 22:22.474
Mum, it's time to go home.
Now.

22:22.541 --> 22:25.877
Yes. I'll never know
why they left me that day.

22:25.944 --> 22:27.879
But I do know
that they loved me.

22:33.085 --> 22:36.254
I thought I'd take this back
to show Clyde and Rani.

22:36.321 --> 22:38.857
-A souvenir, if that's okay?
-Why not?

22:41.093 --> 22:41.893
No.

22:44.329 --> 22:48.300
-No, it can't be.
-What's the matter? Mum?

22:48.366 --> 22:50.902
Today's date. August the 18th.

22:50.969 --> 22:53.305
It's the day they died.

22:53.371 --> 22:56.341
The boy, Oscar.
He told you it was July.
Why would he lie?

22:56.408 --> 22:59.511
They drive off today.
They leave me today.
This afternoon.

22:59.578 --> 23:01.747
-No.
-We've got to go back home.

23:03.381 --> 23:06.818
There! That's the car.

23:06.885 --> 23:10.388
My dad said...
You heard him, he parked it
by the memorial.

23:11.123 --> 23:12.891
We're going home, now!

23:14.025 --> 23:15.827
I could save them
with the sonic.

23:17.095 --> 23:18.463
I could put
the car out of action.

23:18.530 --> 23:20.966
Then wherever they were going,
they'd never leave.

23:21.166 --> 23:23.902
But it's
a fixed point in time.
We know it happened.

23:23.969 --> 23:28.874
-But why?
Why them? It's so unfair!
-You know you can't do it.

23:28.940 --> 23:31.143
Luke, I have saved the lives
of so many people.

23:31.209 --> 23:34.679
People I didn't even know.
I don't know.
Miners on Peladon.

23:34.746 --> 23:37.215
All the people
drinking Bubble Shock!
without a second thought.

23:37.282 --> 23:40.919
-But this is my mum and dad!
-You know you're not meant to.

23:40.986 --> 23:44.389
Why? Why not? Why shouldn't
I save them, too?

23:44.456 --> 23:46.158
What about the way
you were brought up?

23:46.224 --> 23:48.627
If you changed it, then
what if you never meet
the Doctor?

23:48.693 --> 23:50.695
What if you never meet me?

23:50.762 --> 23:52.831
I only want to look
through the fissure,

23:52.898 --> 23:55.233
see what my life becomes
if they survive.

23:55.300 --> 23:57.836
If there's anything wrong,
we come back and
set it right again.

23:57.903 --> 23:58.937
Unless this is the trap!

24:00.572 --> 24:03.074
Why do we have to think
this is something terrible?

24:03.141 --> 24:06.745
What if this is a good thing?
All these years I've been
putting other people first.

24:06.812 --> 24:08.513
There has to be something
at the end of it,
doesn't there?

24:08.580 --> 24:09.581
Something for me.

24:09.648 --> 24:11.883
What if this is it? My reward?

24:14.252 --> 24:17.956
-Please.
Stop for a moment. Think.
-If I do, I'll change my mind.

24:18.023 --> 24:18.890
(CLUNKING)

24:21.660 --> 24:25.030
There.
I've disabled the engine,
now they can't go anywhere.

24:25.096 --> 24:27.299
You always said
changing time
was so dangerous.

24:27.365 --> 24:31.536
Back to the fissure. Now!
Maybe the whole
world will be better.

24:31.603 --> 24:33.872
It's just an experiment.
I have to see.

But there's no clouds,
that's weird.

24:58.363 --> 25:00.498
It's happening.

collect my prize.

25:08.106 --> 25:10.809
What?
I don't like this at all!

25:15.647 --> 25:17.482
-It's Luke! Luke!
-No!

25:19.985 --> 25:23.922
It's not him.
It's that kid, Oscar.

25:24.789 --> 25:26.725
Oscar, what's wrong?

25:26.791 --> 25:29.227
Where's Sarah Jane,
the lady who helped you?

25:29.294 --> 25:32.297
So stupid. Humans.

25:32.364 --> 25:34.666
I really don't like where
that sentence ended up either.

No, think.
It must be the Graske thing
and that'll protect us.

Let's not split up.

-I'm going through.
-Wait for me!

to be a success?

-It was you!

27:28.179 --> 27:31.349

to walk this world.

27:42.627 --> 27:46.231
But he hasn't manifested
himself yet. That's about
to happen here, in 1951.

27:46.297 --> 27:49.901
We're in
an alternative timeline.
Our world never existed.

27:49.968 --> 27:52.804
The Trickster walked through
the Abbot's Gateway

27:52.871 --> 27:54.906
and sucked
the life out of the world.

27:54.973 --> 27:58.910
Too late!
I'm growing stronger.
