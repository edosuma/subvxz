WEBVTT

00:11.470 --> 00:17.184
- Okay, here we go.
- Okay, okay. Family movie night, guys.

00:17.184 --> 00:18.268
- Yeah.
- What we gonna watch?

00:18.268 --> 00:21.438
- We've all gotta agree on something.
- I wanna watch <i>The Emoji Movie.</i>

00:21.438 --> 00:23.982
- Okay.
- Oh, come on. You've seen it 8,000 times.

00:23.982 --> 00:26.818
Yeah, sweetie, I really don't think
I can watch <i>The Emoji Movie</i> again.

00:26.818 --> 00:28.487
But that's what I wanna watch.

00:28.487 --> 00:29.571
What about <i>Inside Out</i>?

00:29.571 --> 00:31.532
- It's so cute. It's not for me.
- Okay.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.325
- I think you'll like it.
- You just wanna watch it again.

00:33.325 --> 00:34.660
You always tear up.

00:34.660 --> 00:36.370
<i>Emoji Movie, Emoji Movie</i>!

00:36.370 --> 00:38.038
- How about <i>John Wick</i>?
- What?

00:38.038 --> 00:40.040
- We're not watching <i>John Wick,</i> Simon.
- No. We're not watching--

00:40.040 --> 00:41.917
- How do you-- No.
- What? No.

00:41.917 --> 00:43.877
Well, maybe there's something new
that came out. Let me check.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.128
Good idea.

00:45.128 --> 00:48.131
- Okay.
<i>- Emoji Movie, Emoji Movie</i>!

00:48.632 --> 00:49.633
Oh, whoa.

00:50.509 --> 00:51.510
- What?
- What?

00:51.510 --> 00:53.554
- Will's getting a divorce.
- Who's Will?

00:53.554 --> 00:56.598
- Will's getting a divorce?
- Yeah. Audrey just posted it on her Insta.

00:56.598 --> 00:58.809
- Who's Will?
- Wait, you didn't know that?

00:58.809 --> 01:01.436
- No. I haven't spoken to him for so long.
- Who's Will?

01:02.229 --> 01:03.772
He's a old friend of mine, honey.

01:03.772 --> 01:06.066
There was a time when Will
was Mommy's best friend.

01:06.066 --> 01:08.527
- Like, an ex?
- No. Just a friend.

01:08.527 --> 01:10.153
With benefits?

01:10.153 --> 01:13.073
- No. Ew. What? No benefits.
- No.

01:13.073 --> 01:16.535
Yeah. In fact, Will was your mom's
maid of honor at our wedding.

01:16.535 --> 01:18.954
What are we watching
for family movie night?

01:18.954 --> 01:20.706
<i>- Emoji Movie, Emoji Movie.</i>
- I can't. I--

01:20.706 --> 01:23.000
I can't watch <i>The Emoji Movie</i> again.
I just can't.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.377
- Oh, babe, why do you care?
- It's a movie about fonts.

01:25.377 --> 01:26.628
- How about <i>Halloween</i>?
- No.

01:26.628 --> 01:27.880
- It doesn't matter.
- Talking fonts.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.423
- Poop emoji!
- It's wrong.

01:29.423 --> 01:31.466
We have so little time together.

01:31.466 --> 01:33.343
- Poop emoji!
- What about <i>Dahmer</i>?

01:33.343 --> 01:34.636
- No.
<i>- Dahmer</i>?

01:34.636 --> 01:36.096
Why not? We should watch <i>Dahmer.</i>

01:36.096 --> 01:37.222
<i>- Dahmer</i>? Okay.
- Yeah.

01:37.973 --> 01:39.099
I know what we're gonna do.

01:42.811 --> 01:43.979
Poop emoji.

01:48.358 --> 01:51.028
- You should call Will.
- I'm the last person he'd wanna hear from.

01:51.028 --> 01:53.739
You're overthinking it.
He probably really wants to hear from you.

01:54.990 --> 01:57.492
I don't know. We literally haven't spoken
to each other in years.

01:57.492 --> 02:00.245
We parted on the worst terms.
His wife hated me.

02:00.245 --> 02:02.372
- You hated her.
- Well, it wasn't that simple.

02:02.915 --> 02:05.125
I told him I thought Audrey
was terrible for him,

02:05.125 --> 02:06.210
and then he married her.

02:06.210 --> 02:08.044
Well, looks like he came around.

02:09.338 --> 02:11.381
Well, it definitely
wasn't worth losing a friend over.

02:11.381 --> 02:12.633
Yeah, so call him.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.260
- It'll just be weird.
- Why?

02:15.260 --> 02:16.345
I don't know.

02:16.345 --> 02:19.681
Men and women don't really hang out
with each other at our age.

02:19.681 --> 02:21.433
- That's not true.
- Come on.

02:21.433 --> 02:22.726
All our friends are couple friends,

02:22.726 --> 02:25.062
and you talk to the men,
and I talk to the women.

02:25.062 --> 02:26.688
Yeah, I guess that is true.

02:26.688 --> 02:29.525
When did it become so hard
for men and women to socialize?

02:29.525 --> 02:33.195
- After we got married? After we had kids?
- Well, you and Will predate all that.

02:33.195 --> 02:36.865
I guess. Poor Will.
He's probably pretty lonely.

02:36.865 --> 02:39.618
Call him. That's what friends do.

03:52.649 --> 03:55.569
- Hi. Oh, my God.
- Hey. Look at you.

03:55.569 --> 03:58.238
- How are you?
- I'm great. How are you?

03:58.238 --> 04:01.033
- You look well. This--
- I am. Feeling good.

04:01.033 --> 04:04.453
- Your T-shirt's good. It's nice. Yeah.
- Yeah, thank you.

04:05.037 --> 04:07.414
You look like a '90s grunge clown.

04:10.501 --> 04:13.587
Gosh. How is it go--
How's the beer business?

04:13.587 --> 04:14.671
Very good, yeah.

04:15.214 --> 04:17.757
I'm actually the brewmaster
at my own bar now.

04:17.757 --> 04:20.260
- What? Congratulations.
- Thank you.

04:21.220 --> 04:22.304
- Yeah.
- Very cool.

04:22.304 --> 04:24.890
I'm actually-- We're having a party
at the bar this weekend.

04:24.890 --> 04:26.892
- Okay.
- Yeah. If you're around--

04:27.476 --> 04:29.436
If you're around this weekend,
stop by the bar.

04:29.436 --> 04:31.730
- I'd love to. Yeah.
- Yeah, I'll send you the details.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.276
Are you still lawyering?

04:36.902 --> 04:39.613
Charlie just made partner,
and I-- I help him out.

04:39.613 --> 04:40.697
Oh, wow.

04:40.697 --> 04:43.450
So, you work at the firm
with Charlie still?

04:43.450 --> 04:45.536
We've been doing a lot of work.
It's been great.

04:46.245 --> 04:49.873
You and Charlie are currently employed
at the same law firm?

04:50.457 --> 04:51.792
I am not on salary.

04:53.043 --> 04:54.294
But that's society for you.

04:56.713 --> 04:58.131
I do not work currently.

04:58.131 --> 05:00.717
I see. You are unemployed currently.

05:02.261 --> 05:04.012
You still got that family of yours?

05:04.012 --> 05:05.347
Yeah. You wanna see a photo?

05:06.265 --> 05:07.307
Yeah.

05:10.018 --> 05:11.019
Wow. There they are.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.939
Cool. Wow.

05:15.399 --> 05:16.400
Cool.

05:18.235 --> 05:19.444
Look healthy.

05:21.363 --> 05:27.411
Well, look, I just wanted to apologize
for how I handled things with your wife.

05:28.161 --> 05:33.333
I felt-- Especially saying
that you shouldn't marry her.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.377
I regret that.

05:37.629 --> 05:38.672
Well...

05:39.965 --> 05:40.883
What?

05:40.883 --> 05:41.842
Nothing.

05:42.593 --> 05:45.596
- What's-- You-- Yeah? You good?
- Nothing. No, I'm just telling you.

05:45.596 --> 05:46.972
Yeah, great, no.

05:48.599 --> 05:50.809
- All right. I appreciate that.
- Yeah.

05:51.476 --> 05:53.645
Well, she's my ex-wife now, so...

05:55.522 --> 05:58.025
- Oh, no! When did that happen?
- Yes.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.526
Just a few months ago. Yeah.

06:00.152 --> 06:02.070
- Oh, no.
- Yep.

06:02.070 --> 06:04.990
How did that happen?
What happened between you guys?

06:05.782 --> 06:09.453
Nothing. It was mutual.
It was very amicable and mutual.

06:09.453 --> 06:11.705
- Okay.
- We're still friends. We hang out.

06:12.331 --> 06:15.000
- Wow. That's very evolved.
- Yes, very amicable.

06:15.667 --> 06:19.213
And, yeah, you know, conscious
uncoupling and all that. All that shit.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.674
Well, divorce is hard.

06:22.674 --> 06:24.092
Let's not.

06:28.514 --> 06:30.849
- Well, this has been a blast.
- This has been so nice to see you.

06:30.849 --> 06:33.685
Yeah. This has been a blast.
This has been so fun.

06:34.811 --> 06:35.646
All right.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.483
- Okay.
- Yeah. If you're around this weekend,

06:39.483 --> 06:40.567
- come to the party.
- For sure.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.152
- I'll send you the details.
- Yeah, definitely.

06:42.152 --> 06:43.946
- Yeah. Great.
- I'll get a babysitter. Okay.

07:05.008 --> 07:06.677
I'm trying to wrap my head around this.

07:06.677 --> 07:09.012
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- She's gone for five years,

07:09.012 --> 07:11.181
- and now she's coming to our party?
- Yes.

07:11.765 --> 07:12.850
That's a little fucked up.

07:12.850 --> 07:14.852
- Why is that fucked up?
- You know, she never liked Audrey.

07:14.852 --> 07:16.979
Now Audrey's out of the picture,
she's back.

07:16.979 --> 07:18.272
Feels a little fucked up to me.

07:18.272 --> 07:21.650
I actually don't think her hating Audrey
has anything to do with her return.

07:21.650 --> 07:24.862
She actually didn't even know that we were
divorced when she asked me out to coffee.

07:24.862 --> 07:27.531
Wait, go back. Who's this chick
that hates my sister so much?

07:27.531 --> 07:31.827
She's a friend of mine. And also,
Audrey, my ex-wife, not your sister.

07:31.827 --> 07:32.911
She's your stepsister.

07:32.911 --> 07:34.955
And as far as I know, your parents
got married when you were, like,

07:34.955 --> 07:37.374
almost out of high school,
so it's pretty weird how close you are.

07:37.374 --> 07:39.334
Also, you don't have to be here.

07:39.334 --> 07:41.044
We run the bar. You're an investor.

07:41.044 --> 07:44.131
You can stay home
and defraud Seth Green out of NFTs, okay?

07:44.131 --> 07:46.091
- Look, I get what's happening here.
- What?

07:46.091 --> 07:48.510
- You can't be friends with a girl.
- That is absolutely not true.

07:48.510 --> 07:50.762
The whole movie <i>When Harry Met Sally</i>
is dedicated to proving

07:50.762 --> 07:52.389
the fact that you can be friends
with a woman.

07:52.389 --> 07:54.391
No, Will. That's a bad example.
Harry marries Sally.

07:54.391 --> 07:55.809
- They fuck. They're not friends.
- Fact.

07:55.809 --> 07:58.103
That movie should be called
<i>When Harry Fucked Sally.</i>

07:58.103 --> 08:00.981
You can only be friends with a woman
if she's not hot. Double fact.

08:00.981 --> 08:01.982
That is not true.

08:01.982 --> 08:04.443
- That's not what I said. Didn't say that.
- No. Fellas, I agree with Will.

08:04.443 --> 08:06.904
Because I'm best friends with my aunt,
and she's a perfect ten.

08:06.904 --> 08:09.239
- Nice.
- There you go.

08:09.239 --> 08:12.367
I have met your aunt,
and she is hot. Fact.

08:14.244 --> 08:16.538
- That's yucky.
- Yeah, it's weird. Anyways.

08:16.538 --> 08:18.123
So, do you think she's gonna come or what?

08:18.123 --> 08:20.542
No. I do not think she'll come.
She lives in Culver City.

08:20.542 --> 08:22.794
She has three or nine children.

08:22.794 --> 08:23.879
I can't remember, honestly,

08:23.879 --> 08:25.964
but it'll be logistically too hard
for her to pull off.

08:25.964 --> 08:27.132
I just invited her to be polite.

08:27.132 --> 08:28.592
Couldn't tell with that body.
Good for her.

08:29.259 --> 08:31.011
I don't think you can tell
how many kids someone has

08:31.011 --> 08:33.138
just from the way their body looks.

08:33.138 --> 08:35.599
I mean, consider for a moment,
the termite queen.

08:35.599 --> 08:39.436
You wouldn't know by looking at it that it
has thousands and thousands of offspring.

08:40.479 --> 08:43.482
Think we're gonna move you
to the back of the house, Omar.

08:50.656 --> 08:51.657
- Bye.
- Bye.

08:51.657 --> 08:53.116
Mommy, don't come with me.

08:53.825 --> 08:55.619
- What?
- I'm not a baby anymore.

08:55.619 --> 08:57.913
I'm in kindergarten.
You don't have to come with me.

08:57.913 --> 09:00.249
I know, but I love to walk you
to your classroom--

09:00.249 --> 09:01.375
Stay.

09:05.754 --> 09:06.964
Okay.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.258
I forgot my water bottle.

09:11.718 --> 09:12.719
Yes!

09:13.303 --> 09:14.847
Like it's any worse for him
than a juice box.

09:14.847 --> 09:16.306
Did you see what just happened?

09:16.306 --> 09:19.059
Maeve didn't want me to walk her
to her classroom anymore.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.269
You had a good run.

09:20.269 --> 09:22.145
It's just so abrupt.

09:22.145 --> 09:24.064
I've been a full-time mom
for the past 13 years,

09:24.064 --> 09:27.192
and now no one even wants to be seen
with me on the schoolyard.

09:27.192 --> 09:28.277
I do.

09:28.944 --> 09:30.153
Yeah, I thought I'd feel relieved

09:30.153 --> 09:32.322
when Maeve finally
went to kindergarten, you know?

09:32.322 --> 09:33.699
Have some time to myself.

09:34.199 --> 09:35.617
Have a shower. Make a salad.

09:35.617 --> 09:37.077
You were never gonna make a salad.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.663
And now I feel like everybody's
just looking at me, going,

09:39.663 --> 09:41.248
"What are you gonna do
with the rest of your life?"

09:41.248 --> 09:44.710
No, no. No one is looking at us.
We're invisible.

09:44.710 --> 09:47.087
We're-- We're middle-aged women. Watch.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.299
Hi. Morning, guys. How was the--

09:51.008 --> 09:52.718
- No.
- This is a midlife crisis.

09:52.718 --> 09:55.262
This is how a woman experiences
a midlife crisis.

09:55.262 --> 09:56.930
You know what I'm thinking you should do?

09:56.930 --> 09:58.849
- Please don't say it.
- Etsy.

09:58.849 --> 10:01.393
- I was a lawyer. I have a law degree.
- I always forget that.

10:01.393 --> 10:04.521
Remember how I told you I was
catching up with that old friend of mine?

10:04.521 --> 10:08.150
He asked me what I did,
and I showed him a picture of my kids.

10:08.734 --> 10:09.568
- Brutal.
- Right?

10:09.568 --> 10:12.237
He couldn't get away from me fast enough.
And I don't blame him.

10:12.237 --> 10:16.283
Honestly, he's, like, this hipster,
brewpub, kind of fashion guy,

10:16.283 --> 10:17.367
and I'm, like, a...

10:18.076 --> 10:20.746
He's hosting a party
at his bar in the Arts District.

10:20.746 --> 10:22.497
We should go!

10:22.497 --> 10:24.791
What? No, no.
No, it's not for people like us.

10:24.791 --> 10:28.545
Maybe I'll meet somebody.
I have had such a long dry spell.

10:28.545 --> 10:30.255
Yeah, that's where
you're gonna meet someone.

10:30.255 --> 10:32.049
But who are you gonna meet
at a downtown brewpub?

10:32.049 --> 10:35.552
- Shia LaBeouf.
- Again? Still with the Shia LaBeouf?

10:36.386 --> 10:40.349
I'm sorry. I just happen
to like them small and angry and crazy.

10:40.349 --> 10:42.601
And you know he's good at fucking.

10:42.601 --> 10:44.520
- No.
- No, you know that he is.

10:44.520 --> 10:46.605
Come on. Let's just go to the party.
Who cares?

10:46.605 --> 10:48.273
This could be the last party
before we die.

10:49.024 --> 10:50.567
- Can't argue with that.
- No.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.152
Bye.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.445
- Oh, my God. Bye, guys!
- Bye.

10:53.445 --> 10:55.072
- See you at pickup.
- Bye.

10:57.533 --> 11:00.035
- Pickpocket them, huh? I'm here.
- Yes! Happily.

11:00.035 --> 11:01.620
- Yeah. I'm here.
- Can't you see me?

11:01.620 --> 11:05.165
- You don't see this? You don't see this?
- I'm here. You don't see this?

11:09.294 --> 11:10.295
Do I look okay?

11:10.295 --> 11:13.674
I feel I dress like a literal cougar.
Like, it's leopard though.

11:13.674 --> 11:16.677
- I mean, do I look divorced and desperate?
- No, you look great.

11:16.677 --> 11:20.013
Oh, holy shit!
Everyone here is Frances's age.

11:20.013 --> 11:24.184
Oh, my God. Is that guy wearing a T-shirt
and no pants? Is that cool now?

11:24.184 --> 11:26.353
Don't ask me. I know as nothing as you.

11:26.854 --> 11:27.980
Well, I'll tell you this.

11:27.980 --> 11:29.815
We may not be young,

11:29.815 --> 11:33.777
but we have life experience
that none of these bitches have.

11:33.777 --> 11:37.281
Oh, yeah.
Like-- Like how to swaddle a newborn.

11:37.281 --> 11:38.407
- Okay. Yeah.
- Right?

11:38.407 --> 11:42.035
I'll tell you this much.
We got better credit than anybody in here.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.120
- Better credit!
- Credit!

11:43.120 --> 11:49.960
<i>- Better credit, better credit
- Better credit, better credit</i>

11:49.960 --> 11:51.295
<i>Better credit...</i>

11:51.295 --> 11:53.046
Sorry for existing.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.966
I just-- This feels like it's gonna be
awkward. I don't know.

11:55.966 --> 11:57.259
We could just go.

11:57.259 --> 11:58.594
Why don't we go and go somewhere else

11:58.594 --> 12:00.053
- and get a glass of wine--
- Okay, yeah. Sure.

12:00.053 --> 12:02.264
- Hey!
- Hi-- Hi!

12:02.264 --> 12:04.433
Oh, my God. He saw me. Hi! Hi!

12:04.433 --> 12:06.351
I don't wanna be here.
I don't wanna be here.

12:06.351 --> 12:08.562
- Hi. Hey!
- Hey! You made it.

12:08.562 --> 12:10.564
- Yeah. Congrats.
- Good to see you.

12:10.564 --> 12:13.108
- Thank you so much. Yeah. Hey.
- Yeah, of course. This is Katie.

12:13.108 --> 12:15.152
- Hi. Hi.
- Katie, Will. Andy.

12:15.152 --> 12:16.236
- Hi.
- Katie.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.614
- Sylvia.
- Hey, man. Congratulations, you guys.

12:18.614 --> 12:21.283
- This is such an achievement.
- So cool. It's so hip.

12:21.283 --> 12:23.202
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Yes.

12:23.202 --> 12:25.078
Will couldn't have done it
without your support, Sylvia.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.247
- Okay. Great.
- I'm gonna-- I'm gonna get us some drinks.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.917
Okay. Listen, I'm not gonna say no,
'cause, you know, it's your thing.

12:29.917 --> 12:31.418
- Okay.
- I can get you to the front.

12:31.418 --> 12:32.586
- Thanks. Thanks.
- Yeah. Yeah.

12:32.586 --> 12:33.921
This is amazing.

12:33.921 --> 12:36.715
- You've really made this work.
- We did it. Yeah, it's cool.

12:36.715 --> 12:39.092
- I have an idea for your next venture.
- Yeah? What is it?

12:39.092 --> 12:41.470
Yes. A wine pub.

12:41.470 --> 12:44.765
A wine pub? Yeah.
Like a place that serves wine and food?

12:44.765 --> 12:46.350
- Yes.
- That's called a restaurant.

12:46.350 --> 12:49.061
- Yeah, not enough of those around, right?
- I'm just saying.

12:49.061 --> 12:52.940
I could be sitting a-- on a chair having
a glass of wine in this very spot.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.191
- That's very true.
- So--

12:55.859 --> 12:57.694
Sorry to interrupt your story.

12:57.694 --> 13:00.113
The lady from <i>LA Times</i> is by the tanks
if you want to talk to her.

13:00.697 --> 13:01.532
Yeah, sure.

13:01.532 --> 13:02.866
- I'll be right back.
- Yeah, cool.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.994
This is so good!
I know you worked so hard on this and--

13:05.994 --> 13:09.873
I don't know what you think you know,
but the divorce is still fresh, okay?

13:09.873 --> 13:11.083
So be careful with my guy.

13:11.083 --> 13:13.460
You talked just as much shit
about her as I did,

13:13.460 --> 13:16.129
but I got blamed and cut out.
That's not fair. That's sexist.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.840
Don't Susan B. Anthony me, okay?

13:17.840 --> 13:20.801
Just 'cause you got your Hillary Clinton
white pantsuit on.

13:20.801 --> 13:23.303
- Wow.
- Listen, I don't make the rules.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.471
I just respect 'em.

13:24.471 --> 13:25.889
I don't know what you're talking about.

13:25.889 --> 13:27.975
- That doesn't make any sense--
- You know what I'm talking about.

13:27.975 --> 13:28.892
- So yeah.
- Well, I don't.

13:29.768 --> 13:31.895
- Sorry. Little do-si-do.
- Okay.

13:31.895 --> 13:34.982
Sorry. That was weird. Congrats.

13:34.982 --> 13:36.358
- Thank you.
- There you go.

13:36.358 --> 13:39.069
- Hey!
- So, I met a guy at the bar.

13:39.069 --> 13:40.779
- What? Tell me everything.
- Yeah!

13:40.779 --> 13:42.573
Well, I couldn't hear anything
that he said.

13:42.573 --> 13:46.493
- Not a word, 'cause it's so loud in here.
- Right. It's very loud.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.453
And I couldn't see him very well.

13:48.453 --> 13:49.538
I don't have my glasses on.

13:49.538 --> 13:52.207
- But it's fun to be out! Yeah.
- That's cute.

13:52.207 --> 13:55.002
Okay, well, I think we should--
We can get outta here.

13:55.002 --> 13:56.378
- Don't tear me away.
- Okay.

13:56.378 --> 13:58.463
Yeah, I'm so fucking tired.

14:01.717 --> 14:03.218
Well, that was a bummer.

14:03.218 --> 14:05.762
- Yeah, I don't know. What did you expect?
- I don't know.

14:05.762 --> 14:07.264
It's just so weird
to be close with someone,

14:07.264 --> 14:09.808
and then all of a sudden
you're complete strangers.

14:09.808 --> 14:13.145
Your friendship with Will is not built
for this phase of life.

14:13.145 --> 14:16.190
I have a lot of male friends.
I mean, I did.

14:16.190 --> 14:17.733
- I used to.
- Yeah, so did I.

14:17.733 --> 14:21.111
My best friend in college,
his name was Oren.

14:21.111 --> 14:22.571
- What happened? You still in touch?
- Yeah.

14:22.571 --> 14:24.031
I talk to him on the phone every night.

14:24.031 --> 14:25.032
- Well, there you go.
- What?

14:25.032 --> 14:27.159
Of course not! What do you think happened?

14:27.159 --> 14:30.162
- What?
- No! No, I don't talk to him every night.

14:30.162 --> 14:31.246
What's wrong with you?

14:31.246 --> 14:34.374
We got very drunk, had sex,
and then we never spoke again.

14:35.459 --> 14:38.462
This thing with you and Will,
it's just more trouble than it's worth.

14:38.462 --> 14:40.130
He's from your past.

14:40.130 --> 14:42.382
- He's like acid-washed jeans.
- Well, they're back in fashion.

14:42.382 --> 14:44.968
- No. Stop.
- They are. Frances told me. They're back.

14:44.968 --> 14:46.637
Goddamn it.

14:46.637 --> 14:49.806
What the f-- I just, just gave them away.

14:49.806 --> 14:51.892
- Chill.
- Shut up. Hey, how dare you?

14:51.892 --> 14:53.894
What the fuck is your fucking problem?

14:53.894 --> 14:56.772
Oh, no. Oh, my God. That's Audrey.
That's his ex-wife.

14:56.772 --> 15:01.068
Bringing a date to my bar?
In what world is that okay?

15:01.068 --> 15:03.153
- That's the ex-wife?
- Yeah.

15:03.153 --> 15:04.279
Geez, she's hot.

15:04.279 --> 15:06.156
- Oh, my God.
- She's a-- She's gorgeous.

15:06.156 --> 15:07.449
She's just gorgeous.

15:07.449 --> 15:09.701
You have everything.
You have the whole world.

15:09.701 --> 15:12.079
I have one place! This place!

15:12.079 --> 15:14.873
And you bring a fucking Nazi to my bar?

15:14.873 --> 15:17.251
- Get this fucking guy out of here.
- But I am from Norway

15:17.251 --> 15:21.672
where a social democratic alliance
has controlled parliament for many--

15:21.672 --> 15:23.590
Don't pretend your family likes Jews.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.133
How fucking dare you?

15:25.133 --> 15:28.178
I know you guys are used to invading
other people's territories,

15:28.178 --> 15:29.555
but this is my bar!

15:29.555 --> 15:31.515
This is my place!
I get this in the divorce.

15:31.515 --> 15:33.600
This is not yours. It's my brother's bar.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.018
He's your fucking stepbrother.

15:35.018 --> 15:37.396
Why do you fixate on that detail?
It's so weird.

15:37.396 --> 15:39.690
Because I think it's weird
how close you are, if I'm being honest.

15:39.690 --> 15:40.649
I think it's weird!

15:40.649 --> 15:43.068
Your stepbrother, by the way?
Not the only owner of this bar.

15:43.068 --> 15:46.280
I own 24.5% of this fucking place!

15:46.280 --> 15:47.364
And meanwhile,

15:47.364 --> 15:50.242
you're bringing Leni Riefenstahl's
fucking key grip in here.

15:50.242 --> 15:53.745
Oh, no, Will. Oh, dear. He's unhinged.
This is awful.

15:53.745 --> 15:55.289
This is so fun.

15:55.289 --> 15:58.542
- I love her shoes.
- My God. That top.

15:58.542 --> 16:02.629
Okay, it was a mistake to bring him,
but you need to cool down.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.548
- You think? I won't cool down.
- Take it down a notch.

16:04.548 --> 16:08.177
In this place, I can be as uncool
as I want. I'll bring it up 20 notches!

16:08.177 --> 16:09.553
That's how-- That's what I'm gonna do.

16:09.553 --> 16:11.597
- Yeah. Go back to the bunker.
- Hey.

16:11.597 --> 16:12.890
Auf Wiedersehen.

16:12.890 --> 16:14.516
That was completely unprofessional, man.

16:14.516 --> 16:16.476
No fucking shit it was!
Do you think I'm happy?

16:16.476 --> 16:18.312
- Completely.
- I know!

16:19.021 --> 16:22.232
This is... I g-- I can't-- I have to stay.

16:22.232 --> 16:23.692
No, don't.

16:23.692 --> 16:25.861
No, no, no, it's not a big deal.
He's just-- He looks so sad.

16:25.861 --> 16:26.945
No, I actually don't care.

16:26.945 --> 16:28.655
So I will see you
at morning assembly tomorrow,

16:28.655 --> 16:29.865
- at 8:15.
- Okay. Okay.

16:30.574 --> 16:33.702
- Jesus Christ. It's 10:15.
- Okay.

16:33.702 --> 16:35.412
Yeah, I-- That's why I'm going home.

16:35.913 --> 16:36.955
Okay.

16:38.999 --> 16:40.501
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey.

16:40.501 --> 16:41.585
You okay?

16:42.711 --> 16:47.216
No. I need to get outta here.
Do you wanna get a drink somewhere else?

16:47.216 --> 16:48.884
- Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

16:50.636 --> 16:52.930
I thought you guys ended
on friendly terms.

16:52.930 --> 16:54.765
That-- That didn't seem very friendly.

16:54.765 --> 16:58.185
Can you tell me what happened?
Like, why it ended and...

16:59.645 --> 17:02.272
She just started to, you know,

17:02.272 --> 17:06.484
think I was not ambitious enough
and not a serious person.

17:06.484 --> 17:07.819
And she thought I drank too much.

17:07.819 --> 17:10.531
- Which is, like, literally your job.
- Literally my job.

17:10.531 --> 17:13.742
I'm working right now. I'm killing it.
Putting in overtime, you know?

17:13.742 --> 17:14.826
But--

17:14.826 --> 17:18.829
And then she kinda moved up
in the world as an art dealer

17:18.829 --> 17:21.458
and she just started to look at me
like I was a fucking loser.

17:21.458 --> 17:25.462
And so I did the mature, responsible thing

17:25.462 --> 17:28.757
and I hooked up with a rando one night.

17:30.759 --> 17:34.888
- So you really are the hero of this story.
- I think I look pretty good, right?

17:35.597 --> 17:36.640
Coming out on top.

17:36.640 --> 17:38.642
- Yeah, you crushed it.
- Yeah, yeah.

17:39.685 --> 17:43.522
Well, there's a lot of pretty lasses here, huh?

17:44.106 --> 17:45.732
Maybe you just need
to be with someone else.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.901
I don't think-- That is not what I need.

17:47.901 --> 17:52.239
I don't mean like a life partner,
but just someone for a bit of fun.

17:52.239 --> 17:54.491
You know, I could do my whole thing again.

17:54.491 --> 17:58.161
I could dust off my wings
and be your wing-lass.

17:58.161 --> 18:00.372
It's okay. Are you drunk?
How many drinks have you had?

18:00.914 --> 18:02.916
I've had two beers, so yes, I am.

18:02.916 --> 18:06.211
This is not a "meet people" bar.
This is a trauma bar, okay?

18:06.211 --> 18:07.421
Where you going?

18:11.925 --> 18:13.886
Hi. Hi, ladies.

18:14.928 --> 18:17.556
He has a lot of tattoos.
I see you have some tattoos, huh?

18:17.556 --> 18:19.600
- Yeah. I do.
- What does this one mean?

18:19.600 --> 18:22.227
It's a tribute to my boyfriend
who was murdered a year ago.

18:22.227 --> 18:24.980
Do you mind me asking what happened?
I've never met anyone who was--

18:24.980 --> 18:26.356
Well, he was stabbed.

18:26.940 --> 18:28.817
Okay, thank you. Nice meeting you.

18:28.817 --> 18:30.819
- It was lovely to meet you.
- Bring it in.

18:30.819 --> 18:32.362
Cheers. Bye.

18:32.362 --> 18:34.281
- Sorry.
- Jesus.

18:34.281 --> 18:37.910
She seemed really sweet
but I think she had a lot of baggage.

18:37.910 --> 18:40.579
You think?
At least if I'm with her, I know if I die,

18:40.579 --> 18:42.289
I'll be honored in the form
of a tramp stamp.

18:42.873 --> 18:44.374
I can't be dating right now.

18:44.374 --> 18:46.877
It is humiliating. I'm 40 years old, okay?

18:46.877 --> 18:50.339
I-- The thought of it is--
gives me a panic attack, you know?

18:50.339 --> 18:53.467
Look. Look at this guy.
Look at this cutie.

18:53.467 --> 18:57.346
Remember him?
He was the king of pussy town!

18:57.346 --> 18:58.847
We don't really say that anymore.

18:58.847 --> 19:02.893
I'm sorry, he was the emperor
of pussy town.

19:02.893 --> 19:06.563
The president of the pussy.
P-town-- P-town daddy.

19:06.563 --> 19:07.689
- All jokes aside...
- Come on.

19:07.689 --> 19:09.858
...look how young and virile I am.

19:09.858 --> 19:16.114
And my look almost seems as though it
is single-handedly being pulled together

19:16.114 --> 19:19.243
through this amazing golden <i>chai</i> necklace.

19:19.243 --> 19:21.787
- Oh, God. Here we go.
- My beautiful <i>chai.</i>

19:21.787 --> 19:23.580
This was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

19:23.580 --> 19:26.708
And now-- Honestly, now that I think
about it, my entire life went downhill

19:26.708 --> 19:30.379
the moment my <i>chai</i> necklace
was thrown away.

19:30.379 --> 19:33.715
I am not gonna apologize
for getting rid of that thing.

19:33.715 --> 19:35.592
Men can't wear gold necklaces.

19:35.592 --> 19:36.677
That was so ugly.

19:36.677 --> 19:39.513
- Tell that to Mel Gibson.
- Exactly.

19:39.513 --> 19:42.516
Literally you have to tell him,
'cause he will not talk to Jewish people.

19:42.516 --> 19:45.018
- All right. That's it. Let's go.
- Where we going?

19:45.018 --> 19:47.062
I'm gonna get you a new <i>chai</i> necklace.

19:47.062 --> 19:49.022
- A <i>chai</i> necklace?
- A <i>chai</i> necklace.

19:49.022 --> 19:52.568
I don't know if there's any 24-hour
Judaica stores in the neighborhood,

19:52.568 --> 19:54.486
- but we'll find one.
- Come on, Mel. Let's go.

19:54.486 --> 19:56.113
Thank you. Good to see you.

19:58.782 --> 19:59.825
Here we are.

20:04.246 --> 20:07.541
- Hello. Hi, hi, hi.
- Hello. We request access.

20:07.541 --> 20:08.709
- Yeah.
- Come in.

20:09.960 --> 20:11.336
- Hello.
- Hello.

20:13.255 --> 20:16.216
- You looking for a guitar?
- No.

20:16.216 --> 20:18.510
'Cause this one belonged to Mick Jagger.

20:19.761 --> 20:21.388
What? How much is it?

20:21.388 --> 20:22.514
A thousand.

20:23.348 --> 20:25.934
That seems like a bargain
for Mick Jagger's guitar.

20:25.934 --> 20:28.312
We could buy it and sell it for a profit.

20:28.312 --> 20:30.689
- It's not Mick Jagger's guitar.
- I'm just saying.

20:30.689 --> 20:34.067
- That might be Rick Jagger's guitar.
- Well, I have an interested buyer.

20:34.651 --> 20:35.819
We're good.

20:36.445 --> 20:37.446
What the fuck?

20:40.699 --> 20:42.075
Look at that. I want that.

20:42.075 --> 20:43.243
The dog?

20:43.243 --> 20:46.246
No, not that. The-- The "W" hanging off
the collar. "W."

20:46.246 --> 20:48.874
Will. I'm Will. That stands for Will.

20:48.874 --> 20:51.460
That's sterling silver. Fifty bucks.

20:51.460 --> 20:53.086
- Wow.
- Fifty dollars.

20:53.086 --> 20:56.798
- Sterling silver. Really?
- That deal. Sterling silver, $50.

20:56.798 --> 20:57.883
Okay.

20:57.883 --> 20:59.134
Come on. Look at that!

20:59.134 --> 21:01.512
- Okay. Sold.
- You got a deal, sir.

21:01.512 --> 21:02.763
Thank you.

21:02.763 --> 21:03.931
Go on and get it now.

21:04.431 --> 21:06.975
- Pardon me?
- I'm not taking anything from Wrestler.

21:07.851 --> 21:12.105
Okay, all right. Thank you, sir.
I would like a refund.

21:13.607 --> 21:17.361
Come on, man. You just took my money,
like, just then.

21:17.903 --> 21:19.112
Yo.

21:20.030 --> 21:22.282
- We got this.
- I can't steal the-- I can't--

21:22.282 --> 21:24.826
I've-- I'm a married woman.
I have three children.

21:24.826 --> 21:27.204
I can't get attacked by a Doberman.

21:27.204 --> 21:30.165
- Why did you come out tonight?
- I wanted to see you, catch up.

21:30.165 --> 21:34.294
No. No, no, no. That is not why
you came out. You came out to have fun.

21:34.294 --> 21:36.672
- I did.
- So why don't we have fun?

21:36.672 --> 21:37.589
- Let's do it. Come on.
- Okay.

21:37.589 --> 21:39.466
Your kids will think it's cool
if their mother's missing an ear.

21:39.466 --> 21:41.426
Plea-- No, no, no. Come on.

21:41.426 --> 21:43.720
Just--
You calm the beast as I approach him.

21:43.720 --> 21:45.514
- How? How-- What shall I--
- Just-- I don't know.

21:46.640 --> 21:51.144
<i>Ring around the rosy
Pocket full of posies...</i>

21:51.144 --> 21:52.813
I feel like I'm in
a fucking horror movie now.

21:52.813 --> 21:54.231
<i>- ...A tissue, a t--</i>
- That's not helping.

21:54.231 --> 21:55.315
Just do something else.

21:55.315 --> 22:00.821
Hi, sweet girl. Hi. I paid for this.

22:01.321 --> 22:03.657
Stay. Thank you.

22:05.075 --> 22:08.912
Okay. Okay. Okay.

22:10.080 --> 22:11.415
Go, go, go!

22:14.459 --> 22:15.669
Okay.

22:16.295 --> 22:18.505
- Go!
- Right, go, go, go.

22:20.465 --> 22:23.635
- Yes! Yes! Worth it!
- Oh, my God. Yes! We got it! Yes!

22:23.635 --> 22:24.845
- Oh, God.
- Yes!

22:24.845 --> 22:28.390
- You want a weed gummy?
- Yes! Oh, yes, I do.

22:28.390 --> 22:29.725
- Let's go.
- Thank you.

22:38.442 --> 22:42.196
- Pretty okay fries, am I right?
- It's good.

22:43.405 --> 22:44.239
So good.

22:45.908 --> 22:48.243
I forgot you get like this
when you're high.

22:48.243 --> 22:49.411
I'm not that high.

22:49.411 --> 22:50.579
Not that high.

22:52.247 --> 22:55.626
So what's it like to be
in a healthy marriage? Is that cool?

22:56.210 --> 22:57.377
- It's good.
- It's good?

22:57.961 --> 22:59.213
Charlie was always pretty perfect.

23:00.172 --> 23:02.257
He's great.
And he just-- he just gets happier.

23:02.257 --> 23:03.967
He's-- Just gets happier.

23:04.468 --> 23:05.719
- That's a nightmare.
- It's like,

23:05.719 --> 23:08.138
- this is really his moment, you know?
- This is his moment.

23:08.722 --> 23:11.225
- Loves being a grown-up.
- He loves being a grown-up.

23:11.225 --> 23:14.394
- So good at being a dad.
- He's good at being a dad.

23:15.896 --> 23:17.606
I didn't understand that at all.

23:18.106 --> 23:20.275
He just makes it look easy and--

23:21.276 --> 23:23.487
You know, I kinda look like a--
like a mess next to him.

23:23.487 --> 23:26.406
You? It makes you look like a mess?

23:27.282 --> 23:28.283
You?

23:28.867 --> 23:30.244
Impossible.

23:30.244 --> 23:33.580
No one in a napkin bib can be a mess,
by definition.

23:33.580 --> 23:35.123
You've taken preventive measures.

23:37.668 --> 23:42.506
How are your... relations?

23:43.674 --> 23:45.384
There is one thing
about the sex that's like--

23:45.384 --> 23:47.010
Okay. There you go.

23:47.010 --> 23:49.555
What is it? Good sex? Bad sex?
Not enough sex?

23:49.555 --> 23:52.182
No. Just a little bit time-consuming.

23:52.182 --> 23:53.600
Time-consuming sex.

23:54.685 --> 23:56.562
- What are we talking about, time wise?
- Half an hour.

23:56.562 --> 23:58.146
- Half an hour?
- Yeah, half an hour.

23:58.146 --> 24:01.191
That's like <i>Modern Family</i>
with commercials.

24:01.191 --> 24:03.569
If I lasted half an hour,
I would throw a parade.

24:03.569 --> 24:08.866
It's too long. It really is too long.
Here's-- Exactly. Wrap it up.

24:08.866 --> 24:10.325
- What are we doing here?
- Wrap it up.

24:10.325 --> 24:11.910
I-- Here's a little secret.

24:11.910 --> 24:14.955
I was with a lady once,
and we were having sex.

24:14.955 --> 24:17.875
I was very drunk so I was not--
I couldn't finish.

24:18.834 --> 24:23.046
She did this thing where she, like,
punched me in the back,

24:23.046 --> 24:25.465
kind of in the lower back,
lower kidneys kind of.

24:25.465 --> 24:28.969
And I don't know what it did. It, like,
flipped some jizz switch in my body,

24:28.969 --> 24:31.346
and I came instantaneously.

24:31.346 --> 24:33.098
- What?
- Yes.

24:33.098 --> 24:36.310
- Is it-- Show me. Where is the button?
- The cum button?

24:39.146 --> 24:41.398
This area right here. I think.

24:41.398 --> 24:42.983
- Right in this area.
- All right.

24:44.276 --> 24:46.236
Well, I don't-- I don't want
anything to happen.

24:46.236 --> 24:48.614
- Don't worry. That's disgusting.
- I don't care.

24:48.614 --> 24:50.324
- This is a medical lesson.
- I don't want--

24:50.324 --> 24:52.576
Don't flatter yourself. Come on.

24:52.576 --> 24:53.660
Now punch my cum button.

24:53.660 --> 24:55.245
All right, I'm doing it. Okay.

24:55.996 --> 24:57.289
There you go.

24:57.289 --> 24:59.833
Except you hit my fart switch
instead of my cum button.

24:59.833 --> 25:01.293
- The fart switch?
- Oh, yeah.

25:01.293 --> 25:04.213
They're right next door,
so you gotta be careful.

25:06.215 --> 25:07.633
All right. What do you wanna do now?

25:07.633 --> 25:09.301
Let's get-- Let's go to Korean barbecue.

25:09.885 --> 25:11.637
No. Oh, no, no, no. I'm going home.

25:11.637 --> 25:14.973
What? Come on. I thought
you were in this with me.

25:14.973 --> 25:18.852
- I am. I'm totally in this with you. I am.
- I'm so depressed. I need you. Don't go.

25:18.852 --> 25:22.814
But I just have so many things tomorrow
and they all start so early.

25:23.398 --> 25:24.316
Fair-weather friend.

25:24.316 --> 25:25.526
- Fair-weather friend?
- Yeah.

25:25.526 --> 25:27.236
The minute I heard, I called you.

25:27.986 --> 25:28.820
Wait, what?

25:28.820 --> 25:31.323
I said the minute I heard about you
and Audrey, I got in touch.

25:31.323 --> 25:33.909
- I ain't no fair-weather friend.
- Wait, that's why you got in touch?

25:34.618 --> 25:37.996
Yeah, well, and I mean, I got in touch
to apologize to you, which I did.

25:37.996 --> 25:41.708
It was a pity call? You knew?
You knew we were divorced?

25:42.876 --> 25:44.545
What's wrong with that, if it was?

25:44.545 --> 25:46.797
I-- You're my friend, I heard the news,

25:46.797 --> 25:49.049
I got in touch,
and I was worried about you.

25:49.049 --> 25:50.133
Okay.

25:51.176 --> 25:53.637
Let's get into it, huh? Shall we?

25:53.637 --> 25:55.931
We were friends
and then you threw that friendship away

25:55.931 --> 25:57.808
because you didn't like
the woman that I was gonna marry.

25:57.808 --> 25:59.726
And then you heard
we were getting divorced,

25:59.726 --> 26:02.062
and you come back around
to do a fucking victory lap.

26:02.062 --> 26:04.189
My position remains unchanged.

26:04.189 --> 26:06.733
She was terrible for you.
And look what happened.

26:06.733 --> 26:08.443
I just-- I was in love,

26:08.443 --> 26:10.737
and I just wanted you to support me.
That's all I wanted.

26:10.737 --> 26:12.739
I was just being honest
because I love you.

26:12.739 --> 26:14.783
And you didn't wanna hear it,
so you ditched me.

26:14.783 --> 26:17.411
I didn't-- I ditched you 'cause it's hard
to be friends with someone

26:17.411 --> 26:19.037
who you know hates your wife.

26:19.037 --> 26:21.456
Isn't honesty what you want
from your closest friends?

26:21.456 --> 26:24.251
- No! Not when it's bad.
- Andy didn't love Audrey,

26:24.251 --> 26:26.628
but you didn't hold that against him,
did you? What's that about?

26:26.628 --> 26:29.173
It's different with men
than it is with women.

26:29.173 --> 26:31.425
- Men, they're-- they're-- He's a l--
- Fuck off.

26:31.425 --> 26:33.343
- They're more mellow about this shit.
- That's bullshit. That's s--

26:33.343 --> 26:36.805
That's ridiculous. And it's fucking
bullshit, and it's insulting.

26:36.805 --> 26:38.515
Sometimes the truth is insulting.
Men are more mellow.

26:38.515 --> 26:39.975
- That doesn't make sense.
- Don't know what to say.

26:39.975 --> 26:42.519
Yeah, men are really mellow.
You know who starts wars? Men.

26:42.519 --> 26:45.939
You think George W. Bush was really
fucking mellow when he invaded Iraq?

26:45.939 --> 26:47.691
Ever heard of Mary Queen of Scots?

26:47.691 --> 26:50.444
Please tell me one thing about
Mary Queen of Scots.

26:50.444 --> 26:51.945
Bloody Mary. That's what they call her.

26:51.945 --> 26:53.655
And you don't get that name
by being mellow.

26:53.655 --> 26:55.532
Margaret Thatcher,
she was a fucking asshole.

26:55.532 --> 26:59.036
That Cara Delevingne,
she seems like a fucking mess.

26:59.036 --> 27:00.787
- Okay?
- Okay, see you later.

27:01.371 --> 27:03.207
- See you later. Have a good one.
- Yeah. Yeah.

27:03.207 --> 27:04.958
- Keep it real.
- Okay.

27:04.958 --> 27:07.044
And by the way, that shit,
that's from 20 years ago.

27:07.920 --> 27:08.921
So is this.

27:10.005 --> 27:11.006
That's a good one.

27:16.011 --> 27:18.347
- Bye. Fuck you.
- Yeah, fuck you.

27:18.347 --> 27:20.724
Hello, sir. Thank you so much.

27:26.396 --> 27:27.523
What do I even do now?

27:54.925 --> 27:57.845
- Hi.
- Hi, baby.

27:57.845 --> 27:58.929
How was it?

27:59.805 --> 28:02.933
It was just the same old shit
with a bunch of drama.

28:04.560 --> 28:06.061
You smell like french fries.

28:07.229 --> 28:08.689
Yeah, we went to Denny's.

28:10.691 --> 28:11.817
I missed you.

28:12.359 --> 28:13.443
Missed you too.

28:25.789 --> 28:26.957
Hi.

28:26.957 --> 28:28.542
- Hi.
- Hi.

28:32.629 --> 28:33.630
Oh, yeah.

28:34.590 --> 28:36.717
Let's take our time tonight.

28:43.182 --> 28:44.183
What was that?

28:44.683 --> 28:47.811
Sorry. Sorry,
it was just an arm spasm. I'm sorry.

28:47.811 --> 28:50.022
Jesus, you really got me there, champ.

28:50.564 --> 28:51.565
Sorry, I just--

28:52.858 --> 28:54.151
You good?

28:54.151 --> 28:57.237
No, I think the moment kinda passed.

28:57.237 --> 28:59.198
- Yeah. Yeah, I get it.
- Okay.

28:59.198 --> 29:00.282
Okay.

29:00.824 --> 29:02.784
- Sorry. Okay.
- It's okay.

29:02.784 --> 29:04.620
- I got one in the post.
- It's okay.

29:04.620 --> 29:05.704
Night.

29:25.557 --> 29:27.434
<i>Back punch did not work, asshole.</i>

29:27.434 --> 29:29.561
<i>- You actually tried that?
- Of course I did.</i>

29:29.561 --> 29:31.063
<i>I made that up.</i>

29:31.063 --> 29:32.397
<i>- You're a liar.
- I am.</i>

29:32.397 --> 29:35.192
<i>You're gonna pay for this.
You're gonna pay for this so hard.</i>

29:35.192 --> 29:36.610
<i>Well, bring it on.</i>

29:37.319 --> 29:38.737
<i>So, what are you doing now?</i>

29:38.737 --> 29:40.864
<i>I'm bidding on Garbage Pail Kids on eBay.</i>

29:41.698 --> 29:42.950
<i>Did you get anything good?</i>

29:42.950 --> 29:44.868
<i>I got an Adam Head in mint condition.</i>

29:44.868 --> 29:46.078
<i>I'm kidding. I don't care.</i>

29:47.663 --> 29:50.791
<i>What are you doing? Online shopping
for a fifth pair of high-waisted jeans?</i>

29:50.791 --> 29:52.793
<i>Fuck off. And yes. How did you know?</i>

29:52.793 --> 29:54.002
<i>Should we hang out again?</i>

29:54.002 --> 29:56.255
<i>Sure, how about, like,
five years from now?</i>

29:56.255 --> 29:59.424
<i>Cool. But Tuesdays are bad
'cause your mom comes over.</i>

30:01.510 --> 30:04.388
<i>Thank you for capitalizing her name.
Very respectful.</i>

30:04.388 --> 30:07.307
<i>She's a working dominatrix,
so she demands respect.</i>

30:07.307 --> 30:09.852
