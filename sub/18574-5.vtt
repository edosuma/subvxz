WEBVTT

00:03.280 --> 00:06.648
Space. The final frontier.

00:12.920 --> 00:16.242
"Final" because it wants to kill us.

00:17.360 --> 00:19.681
Sometimes we forget that.

00:19.760 --> 00:22.161
Start taking it all for granted.

00:22.280 --> 00:25.329
The suits, the ships,
the little bubbles of safety,

00:26.320 --> 00:28.288
as they protect us from the void.

00:31.160 --> 00:34.289
But the void is always waiting.

00:42.400 --> 00:45.404
This isn't the best timing, I know that.

00:45.480 --> 00:47.164
But, typical me.

00:48.600 --> 00:49.806
Maybe it's because...

00:49.880 --> 00:51.484
Oxygen levels critical.

00:51.560 --> 00:53.881
Everything is so messed up,

00:54.680 --> 00:58.241
the trivial stuff just falls
away.

01:00.480 --> 01:05.281
You realise life can be so brief.

01:05.920 --> 01:10.403
And so, I just want to tell you,
if we do get through this...

01:12.640 --> 01:15.450
I want to have a baby with you.

01:25.920 --> 01:28.969
And as soon as my radio's fixed

01:29.920 --> 01:31.160
I'm going to tell you just that.

01:31.240 --> 01:33.004
Mag boots on.

01:38.200 --> 01:39.361
Mag boots on.

01:44.280 --> 01:46.965
Nearly there.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.803
Can you hear me? Ivan?

01:55.000 --> 01:57.606
I still can't hear you, love.
You're wasting your breath.

02:01.240 --> 02:03.686
The one thing we can't waste.

02:25.800 --> 02:27.325
Need to bypass it.

02:42.640 --> 02:44.642
No! No! No! No!

02:44.720 --> 02:46.449
No! No! No!

02:53.160 --> 02:54.286
Yeah!

03:05.040 --> 03:06.565
No!

03:06.640 --> 03:07.971
No!

03:53.040 --> 03:54.849
So how does space kill you?

03:57.560 --> 03:58.686
I'm glad you asked.

04:00.280 --> 04:02.681
The main problem is pressure.

04:04.440 --> 04:05.487
There isn't any.

04:06.040 --> 04:08.407
So don't hold your breath
or your lungs will explode.

04:09.680 --> 04:11.444
Blood vessels rupture.

04:12.840 --> 04:15.127
Exposed areas swell.

04:16.360 --> 04:17.361
Fun fact...

04:17.959 --> 04:22.409
The boiling temperature of water
is much lower in a vacuum.

04:22.480 --> 04:23.606
Which means...

04:25.160 --> 04:26.161
that your sweat

04:26.360 --> 04:28.727
and your saliva will boil.

04:30.160 --> 04:32.128
As will the fluid around your eyes.

04:33.800 --> 04:35.882
You won't notice any of this

04:36.040 --> 04:37.610
because 15 seconds in,

04:37.680 --> 04:40.809
you passed out as oxygen bubbles
formed in your blood,

04:40.880 --> 04:42.006
and 90 seconds in...

04:47.480 --> 04:48.686
You're dead.

04:51.320 --> 04:52.367
Any questions?

04:55.760 --> 04:56.761
Yes.

04:57.720 --> 04:59.324
What's this got to do
with crop rotation?

05:01.080 --> 05:03.924
Er, I don't know.
But space is great, isn't it?

05:04.200 --> 05:05.281
You're missing it, aren't you?

05:05.840 --> 05:08.207
- Crop rotation?
- Space.

05:10.840 --> 05:13.650
I'm worried you're thinking
about taking another trip, sir.

05:13.960 --> 05:15.724
I'm here, I'm guarding the vault.
What do you want from me?

05:16.480 --> 05:17.561
The truth.

05:18.240 --> 05:19.571
Don't be unreasonable.

05:29.760 --> 05:30.807
Space.

05:31.240 --> 05:34.050
Going to space is exactly like camping.

05:34.560 --> 05:36.562
- Is it?
- Er, or no.

05:37.080 --> 05:38.730
- Okay.
- Well, in a way, yes.

05:39.280 --> 05:41.726
- Great.
- Too much between you and the outside

05:41.800 --> 05:43.131
and you might as well stay home.

05:43.200 --> 05:44.201
To really feel it,

05:44.280 --> 05:47.045
you need the space equivalent
of a wafer-thin sleeping bag

05:47.120 --> 05:49.009
and a leaky two-man tent.

05:49.080 --> 05:50.081
So, pick a campsite.

05:51.840 --> 05:53.569
- Got any reviews?
- What?

05:53.960 --> 05:55.007
You know, like for restaurants.

05:55.240 --> 05:57.527
"Waiter was a bit handsy,
lasagne gave me the trots. Two stars."

05:57.600 --> 05:58.601
Strangely, no.

06:00.320 --> 06:02.288
Oh, I don't know. That one.

06:02.440 --> 06:04.807
Ah, yes.
Well, er, possibly we could go there

06:04.880 --> 06:06.530
and pitch our tent next
to the toilet block.

06:06.720 --> 06:08.722
How about something a bit more exciting?

06:11.560 --> 06:13.369
What's that?

06:13.440 --> 06:15.249
That is my theme tune.

06:16.200 --> 06:18.328
Otherwise known as a distress call.

06:18.400 --> 06:19.731
You like distress calls?

06:19.880 --> 06:22.360
You only really see
the true face of the universe

06:22.440 --> 06:23.965
when it's asking for your help.

06:24.040 --> 06:26.361
Haven't seen my true
face in years.

06:26.960 --> 06:28.450
Swapped it for this one on the run.

06:28.520 --> 06:31.091
Oh, look, Bill. It's Nardole.
What a lovely surprise.

06:32.120 --> 06:34.168
I thought I sent you to Birmingham
for a packet of crisps.

06:34.240 --> 06:36.447
Yeah, I saw through your cunning ruse.

06:36.520 --> 06:38.841
Yes, well, if you will go thinking
for yourself. What do you want?

06:38.920 --> 06:40.251
I was given strict instructions

06:40.680 --> 06:42.284
to keep you at the university.

06:42.760 --> 06:44.046
- Who by?
- You.

06:44.440 --> 06:46.090
Well, you're not doing
a very good job, are you?

06:46.160 --> 06:47.207
I'll overlook it this once.

06:47.720 --> 06:49.085
Do you know what this is?

06:49.560 --> 06:50.971
If it is not crisps, you're sacked.

06:51.080 --> 06:52.923
Fluid link K-57.

06:53.040 --> 06:55.930
Removed it from the TARDIS
the other night after your lecture.

06:56.240 --> 06:58.208
That is very untrusting.

06:58.320 --> 06:59.731
You took an oath, sir.

06:59.800 --> 07:01.529
The vault cannot be unguarded.

07:01.760 --> 07:02.761
Listen to Mr Boring.

07:02.960 --> 07:04.450
I'm acting under your orders.

07:04.600 --> 07:05.601
See how reliable I am?

07:05.920 --> 07:07.001
What's a fluid link?

07:07.080 --> 07:10.129
No idea. But the TARDIS
can't go anywhere without it.

07:10.600 --> 07:11.840
- Who told you that?
- You did.

07:11.920 --> 07:13.206
Exactly.

07:13.840 --> 07:16.047
- What...
- Teach you to trust me.

07:16.560 --> 07:17.561
No.

07:17.760 --> 07:18.921
I'm docking your pay for this.

07:37.760 --> 07:39.888
- I'm a bit cross with you, sir.
- Noted.

07:40.520 --> 07:41.681
Scored out and forgotten.

07:42.760 --> 07:44.728
Wait. There's no oxygen.

07:44.960 --> 07:46.007
What?

07:46.480 --> 07:47.481
Well, how come we're breathing?

07:47.640 --> 07:49.483
Air shell around the TARDIS. Hang on.

07:54.640 --> 07:57.007
Now there's a really big air shell
around the TARDIS.

07:57.560 --> 07:58.721
HOW big?

08:05.200 --> 08:06.440
Big enough for a stroll.

08:08.200 --> 08:09.326
So cocky.

08:14.440 --> 08:15.601
Why aren't we floating?

08:15.680 --> 08:16.806
Artificial gravity.

08:25.080 --> 08:26.445
Doesn't feel like space.

08:30.680 --> 08:31.681
Ah!

08:35.760 --> 08:38.081
Now it feels like space.

08:39.159 --> 08:41.811
Look at this classic design.

08:42.240 --> 08:43.684
Pressure seals.

08:44.320 --> 08:45.321
Hinges.

08:46.640 --> 08:48.529
None of that "schuck-schuck" nonsense.

08:49.040 --> 08:51.247
Space doors are supposed to go
"schuck-schuck."

08:51.800 --> 08:53.564
Not "Mmm..."

08:56.120 --> 08:57.884
- Are you gonna be like this all clay?
- Yeah.

08:57.960 --> 08:59.644
Till you're back where you should be.

08:59.720 --> 09:00.721
Er, guys.

09:01.800 --> 09:03.370
Hmm?

09:06.760 --> 09:07.886
Hello?

09:30.480 --> 09:31.641
He's dead.

09:32.040 --> 09:34.008
Well, how can he be dead?
He's standing up.

09:35.640 --> 09:36.641
Er, no.

09:36.840 --> 09:38.080
His suit's standing up.

09:38.680 --> 09:40.887
- He's just along for the ride.
- Oh, God.

09:42.280 --> 09:43.486
What, it's standing for him?

09:43.760 --> 09:47.765
Gyro stabilisers, magnetic boots,
gloves, on-board computer.

09:47.840 --> 09:49.683
It could run, jump and update
his Facebook.

09:51.760 --> 09:53.444
Death, where is thy sting?

09:54.280 --> 09:55.327
So...

09:55.400 --> 09:56.925
Back to the TARDIS?

09:57.480 --> 09:58.527
Yeah, can you turn it off?

09:58.600 --> 09:59.806
Turn what off?

10:00.000 --> 10:01.650
The suit. just... just please.
Just turn it off.

10:01.960 --> 10:03.086
Why?

10:03.160 --> 10:04.321
It's just standing there.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.889
It's sick. It's disrespectful.

10:07.360 --> 10:08.885
Tell you what's disrespectful.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.047
Whatever killed him.

10:12.080 --> 10:14.242
Well, there was no oxygen, right?

10:15.040 --> 10:16.041
Before we got here?

10:17.040 --> 10:19.042
Didn't he just suffocate?

10:19.560 --> 10:21.927
Well, his tank's full.

10:22.560 --> 10:23.721
And...

10:26.800 --> 10:27.881
His field's up.

10:28.120 --> 10:29.201
His what?

10:29.400 --> 10:30.845
Force field. Keeps the air in.

10:31.040 --> 10:32.849
Well, look, can't we just, like,
lie him down or something?

10:32.920 --> 10:35.127
- I mean, this isn't right.
- No, it isn't.

10:35.480 --> 10:36.481
Or is it?

10:37.120 --> 10:39.885
Mining station. Chasm Forge. Crew of 40.

10:40.520 --> 10:44.002
I've got 36 records of life
signs terminated.

10:44.320 --> 10:47.164
Last log entry,
"Station declared non-profitable."

10:47.640 --> 10:49.722
Yeah, your workers all dying
will do that for you.

10:55.440 --> 10:58.842
Okay, then. Back to the TARDIS.
Lovely in there.

10:59.040 --> 11:01.042
- Nice and cosy.
- Yeah, yeah, he's right.

11:08.440 --> 11:09.441
Doctor, you listening?

11:10.720 --> 11:11.721
Forty minus thirty-six.

11:12.320 --> 11:13.446
- Sorry, what?
- Equals what?

11:13.520 --> 11:14.931
Oh, no, I was just saying
that Nardole was...

11:15.000 --> 11:16.081
Four.

11:16.440 --> 11:17.566
Four, Bill.

11:18.800 --> 11:19.961
Four survivors.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.365
One distress call.

11:23.520 --> 11:26.091
The universe show its true face
when it asks for help.

11:26.160 --> 11:28.561
We show ours by how we respond.

11:35.720 --> 11:36.721
Any questions?

11:37.640 --> 11:38.687
Good.

11:39.560 --> 11:40.846
Mmm-mmm.

11:56.400 --> 11:57.401
Hello.

12:16.120 --> 12:17.451
Has he got his tunes on?

12:17.800 --> 12:18.881
Not exactly.

12:24.280 --> 12:25.441
Calm down, it's empty.

12:25.560 --> 12:27.642
And you couldn't just tell us?

12:27.720 --> 12:28.801
Are you trying to scare us?

12:28.920 --> 12:30.285
I'm maxing out your adrenaline.

12:30.480 --> 12:32.482
Fear keeps you fast. Fast is good.

12:32.560 --> 12:34.642
- Do people ever hit you?
- Well, only when I'm talking.

12:36.160 --> 12:37.685
So it's basically a robot?

12:37.760 --> 12:39.603
- Er, well.
- Ew.

12:39.680 --> 12:41.409
Sort of. Fairly dumb.

12:41.960 --> 12:43.200
Capable of simple tasks.

12:43.280 --> 12:45.123
You better watch your step.
You could be out of a job.

12:45.680 --> 12:47.842
And... Ah! Speech.

12:49.440 --> 12:50.487
Hello, suit.

12:50.560 --> 12:53.006
Good morning. How may I assist?

12:53.080 --> 12:54.969
Ooh, I recognise that voice.

12:55.640 --> 12:57.722
Yes, nice girl. Actress.

12:58.160 --> 13:00.891
Bit orange.
Left me for an AI in a call centre.

13:00.960 --> 13:02.405
What killed the crew of this station?

13:02.480 --> 13:04.881
I am unaware of any recent deaths.

13:04.960 --> 13:06.962
What about the oxygen?
Where did it all go?

13:07.040 --> 13:09.964
There has never been
any oxygen in this station-

13:10.520 --> 13:11.931
No? Listen to that.

13:12.440 --> 13:14.920
- Still saucy after all these years.
- Explain.

13:15.440 --> 13:19.843
Oxygen is available for personal use
only at competitive prices.

13:20.960 --> 13:22.086
It's only in the suits.

13:23.120 --> 13:24.246
Personal use.

13:24.360 --> 13:27.523
They only have oxygen
in the suits themselves.

13:27.680 --> 13:31.162
Any unlicensed oxygen
will be automatically expelled

13:31.240 --> 13:32.730
to protect market value.

13:32.840 --> 13:34.251
Charging for the air
you breathe?

13:34.680 --> 13:37.081
She hasn't changed. What was her name?

13:37.160 --> 13:38.161
Hang on.

13:38.840 --> 13:40.330
Didn't we just feel the space with air?

13:40.640 --> 13:43.166
Yes, I suppose we did.

13:43.280 --> 13:44.281
Because...

13:45.040 --> 13:46.451
It said "expelled."

13:48.240 --> 13:49.241
What's that?

13:55.320 --> 13:56.321
It's decompressing!

13:56.440 --> 13:57.441
What?

14:24.960 --> 14:26.450
Sir.

14:26.520 --> 14:29.410
The TARDIS is on the other side of that.

14:29.480 --> 14:31.801
Yes, I was really hoping
that someone would state the obvious.

14:31.880 --> 14:34.611
Vacuum behind it. Can't open it.

14:34.680 --> 14:36.011
Oh, you're on a roll.

14:36.080 --> 14:39.209
And if we could,
we'd be sucked out into space.

14:41.680 --> 14:42.681
What's that?

14:43.160 --> 14:44.161
Er...

14:44.840 --> 14:45.841
Nothing to worry about.

14:46.040 --> 14:47.280
Really?

14:47.360 --> 14:49.044
Yes, not for several minutes.

14:49.120 --> 14:50.485
Well, don't stress early.

14:50.600 --> 14:52.443
- It's a waste of energy.
- Stress about what?

14:52.640 --> 14:55.041
Occupants of repair
station, please identify.

14:55.160 --> 14:57.401
Occupants of repair station,
please identify.

14:58.280 --> 15:00.282
Hello, there. You first.

15:00.360 --> 15:03.125
- I'm sorry?
- Well, all your crew mates are dead.

15:03.200 --> 15:05.521
So either you're extremely lucky
or you killed them. Which is it?

15:05.600 --> 15:09.446
This is Drill Chief Tasker
and I haven't killed anyone. Yet.

15:09.680 --> 15:12.047
- Now, who is this?
- Doctor, plus two.

15:12.800 --> 15:14.290
You sent out a distress call.

15:14.960 --> 15:16.928
You should be expecting company.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.401
Now tell me, what happened to the crew
of this station?

15:19.600 --> 15:22.001
Hang on.
You 're in the repair bay, right?

15:22.080 --> 15:23.764
Get out of there. Now.

15:23.840 --> 15:24.841
Why?

15:24.920 --> 15:26.160
There are suits in there.
For Gods sake...

15:26.960 --> 15:28.325
Stay away from the suits.

15:50.240 --> 15:52.288
- Doctor!
- It's fried. Should be safe.

15:52.360 --> 15:53.725
Well, you thought you were safe before.

15:53.800 --> 15:55.962
Yes, well, I'm bound
to be right eventually, aren't I?

16:00.160 --> 16:01.400
Get me some history.

16:02.240 --> 16:04.208
You okay?

16:04.280 --> 16:07.409
Yeah. just...
just a little freaked, I think.

16:07.480 --> 16:09.528
Try not to breathe so fast.

16:10.760 --> 16:13.366
A single line of instruction
was sent to all suits.

16:13.760 --> 16:15.683
"Deactivate your organic component."

16:16.680 --> 16:17.966
- "Organic component"?
- Yeah.

16:18.040 --> 16:19.121
As in, people?

16:19.200 --> 16:20.884
- Ooh.
- Interesting.

16:21.320 --> 16:23.049
They were killed by their own suits.

16:23.320 --> 16:24.401
Can you fry those ones, too?

16:25.040 --> 16:26.485
Possibly.

16:26.560 --> 16:27.925
But we have another problem.

16:28.240 --> 16:31.244
Opening the airlock
was the station's Plan A.

16:31.440 --> 16:35.081
Plan B, filtering out all the oxygen.

16:35.480 --> 16:37.084
So they can sell it back to us.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.162
Capitalism in space.

16:41.400 --> 16:44.563
If we want to keep breathing,
we have exactly one option.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.490
Buy the merchandise.

16:47.960 --> 16:50.122
Oxygen levels
are seriously depleted.

16:50.360 --> 16:54.410
Please step on board your Ganymede
System Series 72 smart suit.

16:54.840 --> 16:57.286
Engage pressure pad
to activate customised robing.

16:58.160 --> 16:59.764
You said those things
were gonna kill us.

16:59.840 --> 17:01.205
Well, on the bright side,
we're dying already.

17:01.280 --> 17:02.566
How does this help?

17:02.640 --> 17:05.371
We know that they killed their occupants
on specific orders.

17:05.440 --> 17:07.840
I think these ones
are off-network for repairs.

17:07.920 --> 17:09.365
So they can't receive commands.

17:09.440 --> 17:10.441
What if you're wrong?

17:10.520 --> 17:12.363
Well, we'll be horribly murdered.

17:12.599 --> 17:14.170
- What?
- Let's say I'm right.

17:14.240 --> 17:17.561
Doctor, if those suits
have killed 36 people,

17:17.640 --> 17:20.769
that means there's 36 corpses
walking about this station.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.281
You know,
that really doesn't matter right now.

17:23.359 --> 17:24.724
Correction. Yeah, it does.

17:25.280 --> 17:26.884
Because I think there's something
moving out there.

17:30.600 --> 17:31.601
Ooh.

17:36.080 --> 17:37.684
Suits. Now.

17:42.200 --> 17:45.488
Welcome to the Ganymede System
Series 12 smart suit.

17:45.560 --> 17:47.244
Oxygen field engaged.

17:48.840 --> 17:53.607
At current levels of exertion,
you have 2,500 breaths available.

17:54.040 --> 17:55.041
Breaths?

17:55.240 --> 17:56.844
They couldn't just give it
to me in minutes?

17:56.920 --> 17:57.921
It don't work like that.

17:58.200 --> 18:00.168
When you panic, you breathe quicker.

18:00.240 --> 18:01.321
You die quicker.

18:01.400 --> 18:04.404
Yeah, the scareder you are,
the faster you suffocate.

18:04.600 --> 18:06.329
So, relax or die.

18:06.680 --> 18:07.806
Sorry.

18:07.880 --> 18:09.245
Probably not the most helpful thought.

18:09.680 --> 18:11.330
So, er... Breathe in.

18:11.400 --> 18:12.606
Huh?

18:13.960 --> 18:16.531
- Breathe out.
- Drill Chief Tasker, do you read me?

18:16.600 --> 18:18.011
- Read you, Doctor.
- Breathe in...

18:18.080 --> 18:20.686
You need to take Corridor
12 to Processing.

18:20.760 --> 18:21.841
- Quickly.
- Come on.

18:21.920 --> 18:23.490
We better go. Come on.
But keep breathing.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.330
They're here!

18:29.400 --> 18:30.561
Come on, this way.

18:30.640 --> 18:32.449
You look like you're trying to run.

18:32.520 --> 18:34.090
Would you like some help with that?

18:34.160 --> 18:37.642
- Can you shut your girlfriend up?
- Velma, that was her name.

18:37.720 --> 18:40.564
Confirmed. My name is now Velma.

18:53.720 --> 18:56.121
We've hit a sealed door at the end
of Corridor 12. No way through.

18:56.480 --> 18:57.845
My suit's really called Velma?

18:57.920 --> 18:59.763
Correct. My name's Velma.

19:00.400 --> 19:01.401
Tasker, come in.

19:01.600 --> 19:02.681
Oh, they're through.

19:02.760 --> 19:04.171
Anyone?

19:04.640 --> 19:06.642
Breathe in, breathe out.

19:06.840 --> 19:08.649
- Hello.
- Breathe in, breathe out.

19:09.280 --> 19:11.647
- Breathe in, breathe out.
- Anybody?

19:11.720 --> 19:12.721
Tasker!

19:16.040 --> 19:17.041
Tasker.

19:17.400 --> 19:18.526
Breathe out!

19:19.720 --> 19:21.688
Breathe out! Help me!

19:24.760 --> 19:26.000
Deadlock the door.

19:26.640 --> 19:28.449
Cutting it a bit fine, weren't we?

19:28.520 --> 19:30.284
There was some debate over
whether to open it at all.

19:31.760 --> 19:33.649
Er, sorry.

19:34.040 --> 19:35.883
I wasn't expecting...

19:38.360 --> 19:39.361
Hello.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.445
Great, we rescued a racist.

19:41.560 --> 19:42.561
What? Excuse me?

19:42.680 --> 19:44.842
- And you are?
- We got your distress call.

19:45.920 --> 19:47.888
Sorry.
It's just that I haven't seen many...

19:48.520 --> 19:50.409
Well, any of your people.

19:50.840 --> 19:51.841
It shows.

19:52.040 --> 19:54.008
- They're from the union.
- The union's a myth.

19:54.200 --> 19:55.201
Take a look.

19:56.440 --> 19:59.091
Yeah, we're from the mythical union.

19:59.440 --> 20:00.487
Dahh-Ren.

20:00.920 --> 20:01.921
We're here to help.

20:02.840 --> 20:03.921
Sorry, is your name Darren?

20:04.120 --> 20:05.281
Dahh-Ren.

20:05.840 --> 20:08.730
Oh. Makes more sense.

20:09.120 --> 20:11.361
Ah, that's not me.
That... That's not me.

20:11.800 --> 20:13.609
It's just glitching. Ivan.

20:13.960 --> 20:14.961
Take a look.

20:18.240 --> 20:20.720
Look, for the record,
I'm not prejudiced.

20:20.800 --> 20:23.280
- I'm usually on the receiving end.
- Oh, why?

20:24.040 --> 20:25.166
What, you really don't know?

20:25.240 --> 20:28.323
Would you like to give feedback
on your experience so far?

20:28.400 --> 20:30.528
- Would you class...
- Right, where's your ship?

20:30.600 --> 20:32.648
Er, we're parked just off
your repair station.

20:32.720 --> 20:34.324
Then you might as well be on the moon.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.528
- They're swarming round there now.
- It's just maths now.

20:36.880 --> 20:38.484
Oxygen divided by bodies.

20:39.080 --> 20:41.560
None of us have more
than 3,000 breaths left.

20:41.680 --> 20:42.681
Then stop wasting them.

20:42.920 --> 20:44.410
I need a map of the base.

20:44.480 --> 20:46.164
And a full rundown
of what happened here.

20:46.240 --> 20:47.526
Who the hell put you in charge?

20:47.720 --> 20:48.926
I'm here to save your lives,

20:49.000 --> 20:50.889
but if you don't want me to,
just raise your hand.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.730
Abby. Get the man a map.

21:03.440 --> 21:04.601
All right?

21:06.880 --> 21:08.006
Some of my best friends are bluish.

21:16.080 --> 21:18.287
- Why is Velma the only one that talks?
- Velma?

21:19.000 --> 21:20.001
My suit.

21:20.600 --> 21:24.127
The others do sometimes.
Mostly to say, "Here's the bill."

21:24.640 --> 21:27.166
Is there a mute button?

21:28.080 --> 21:30.003
Yours isn't working.

21:30.080 --> 21:32.287
Suit's a mess.
Needs a complete overhaul.

21:35.280 --> 21:36.520
Thanks, mate.

21:37.200 --> 21:38.361
Don't mention it.

21:39.840 --> 21:42.047
"Deactivate
your organic component."

21:42.120 --> 21:44.122
All the suits got
the same command.

21:44.200 --> 21:45.964
Best guess, someone hacked the network.

21:46.080 --> 21:48.128
- And you survived how?
- We were off-network.

21:48.960 --> 21:50.724
You have to be to repair the conveyors.

21:50.800 --> 21:52.643
It was just dumb luck.

21:53.600 --> 21:55.090
The measurements.

21:55.160 --> 21:57.811
- Are these in metres?
- Average breaths.

21:57.880 --> 22:00.850
- The only unit worth a damn out here.
- Of course they are.

22:00.920 --> 22:02.445
Forty breaths to the dorms.

22:02.520 --> 22:03.567
One-twenty to the core.

22:04.160 --> 22:06.481
That's where we're headed.
It's the safest place.

22:06.560 --> 22:09.131
Are there more suits
inside the base, or out?

22:09.200 --> 22:10.531
Outside is suicide.

22:10.760 --> 22:14.924
Inside we can move faster than them.
Outside, they have the edge.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.843
- Which means we're dead.
- What are you mining?

22:17.160 --> 22:18.685
Is it worth stealing?

22:18.760 --> 22:20.000
You think this is a robbery?

22:20.080 --> 22:21.730
Well, killing you'd be a good
start if it was.

22:21.800 --> 22:23.131
It's how I'd do it.

22:24.120 --> 22:28.091
If I was to do that sort of thing,
which, actually, I probably wouldn't.

22:28.160 --> 22:29.685
So, please don't worry.

22:29.760 --> 22:31.410
Well, they picked a fine day for it.

22:31.840 --> 22:34.207
This is the least productive
we've all been for months.

22:34.720 --> 22:35.960
Look, we're mining copper ore.

22:36.040 --> 22:39.249
You'd need to steal a mountain
to make it worth your while.

22:41.120 --> 22:42.963
Your employers.

22:43.040 --> 22:45.281
- Any help from them?
- They're too far away.

22:45.400 --> 22:46.561
Not that it matters.

22:47.320 --> 22:49.527
Whoever hacked the suits
also cut the radio.

22:50.200 --> 22:52.885
- So your distress call...
- Was a botch.

22:52.960 --> 22:54.883
I boosted a suit radio through the dish.

22:56.840 --> 22:57.921
Good job.

23:09.240 --> 23:10.924
What about the brains
of these suits?

23:11.560 --> 23:12.561
The AI.

23:13.080 --> 23:14.127
They're dumb as rocks.

23:15.680 --> 23:17.170
But can they learn?

23:17.280 --> 23:18.566
Evolve, grow?

23:19.440 --> 23:21.681
Maybe get tired
of carrying pesky humans around?

23:22.360 --> 23:23.361
Know the feeling?

23:23.440 --> 23:24.441
Yeah.

23:24.600 --> 23:26.887
They've got limited problem-solving
and that's it.

23:27.800 --> 23:29.404
I'm missing something.
What am I missing?

23:29.840 --> 23:30.841
Oxygen.

23:32.200 --> 23:33.406
That's what we're missing.

23:33.800 --> 23:35.006
Maybe find some of that,

23:35.080 --> 23:36.525
and leave the big picture
till later, yeah?

24:01.680 --> 24:03.967
They're fixing the lock.

24:04.040 --> 24:05.530
Well, then it's time to go.

24:05.600 --> 24:07.762
Limited problem-solving, eh?

24:09.000 --> 24:10.365
West corridor is free.

24:10.880 --> 24:12.689
Forty breaths to the core. Let's move.

24:24.520 --> 24:26.170
Quick! They're through.

24:27.640 --> 24:29.642
Instruction received.

24:29.720 --> 24:32.200
Organic component will be deactivated.

24:32.480 --> 24:35.802
Please remain calm while
your central nervous system is disabled.

24:35.880 --> 24:37.644
Your life is in our hands.

24:37.720 --> 24:38.881
Airlock!

24:54.520 --> 24:56.648
Airlock. Helmets on.

25:00.280 --> 25:01.691
- Where are we going?
- Outside.

25:01.920 --> 25:03.365
Well, didn't they say
that was a bad idea?

25:03.440 --> 25:04.566
It is.

25:05.800 --> 25:06.847
But I know a worse one.

25:08.880 --> 25:10.803
Wait. Why do I need that?

25:10.880 --> 25:13.611
What about the air force field thing?

25:13.680 --> 25:15.409
Not strong enough for a vacuum.

25:15.480 --> 25:16.481
Trust me.

25:26.720 --> 25:28.245
What happens if I throw up in my helmet?

25:28.880 --> 25:30.723
Colour and smells.

25:31.480 --> 25:33.403
Don't throw up in helmet. Check.

25:42.760 --> 25:44.649
Warning. Helmet malfunction.

25:44.720 --> 25:45.960
Er, Doctor?

25:46.040 --> 25:47.644
Please advise local technician.

25:47.880 --> 25:48.881
Somebody, stop it!

25:50.040 --> 25:52.361
- Put it back on!
- Doctor, that's not me doing that.

25:52.440 --> 25:54.124
- Put it back on!
- I'm trying.

25:54.480 --> 25:55.527
I can't move my arms.

25:57.320 --> 25:58.367
Stop the cycle.

25:58.440 --> 26:00.602
We can't stop it. It's automated.

26:00.920 --> 26:02.809
Then we know
why your ship was being repaired.

26:02.880 --> 26:04.405
Bill. Bill!

26:04.680 --> 26:06.648
You're about to be exposed
to the vacuum of space.

26:07.160 --> 26:08.366
Oh, God.

26:08.480 --> 26:10.084
So don't hold your breath.

26:10.560 --> 26:11.846
Or my lungs will explode.

26:11.920 --> 26:13.729
You were listening. Well done.

26:17.680 --> 26:18.920
What are we gonna do?

27:42.360 --> 27:44.328
Argh.

27:56.680 --> 27:57.681
Suit.

27:58.880 --> 27:59.961
Suit!

28:00.720 --> 28:02.404
- Velma.
- Good morning.

28:02.880 --> 28:04.450
- How may I assist?
- Shh. Shh.

28:05.320 --> 28:06.321
I can't move.

28:06.400 --> 28:10.325
This suit is currently offline
for diagnostic purposes.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.810
Oh, Nardole, Ivan, thank God!

28:22.360 --> 28:24.488
You're awake. Told you.

28:24.600 --> 28:25.601
Are you okay?

28:26.160 --> 28:27.161
No.

28:28.480 --> 28:29.845
What happened? I can't move.

28:31.120 --> 28:33.726
Well, your suit is set to auto.

28:34.080 --> 28:35.844
The Doctor hacked it and walked you out.

28:35.920 --> 28:37.649
Ah,
and you've got oxygen deprivation,

28:37.720 --> 28:39.131
which is why you feel...

28:39.200 --> 28:40.929
- Like you feel.
- Have you looked down there?

28:41.000 --> 28:42.001
Hmm?

28:42.520 --> 28:43.965
Ah, no, they're fine.

28:44.520 --> 28:45.521
What?

28:46.240 --> 28:48.242
Are we safe? What's stopping them?

28:48.520 --> 28:49.806
This whole area's new.

28:50.560 --> 28:51.971
It's not in their mapping system.

28:52.040 --> 28:53.451
Hmm, see?

28:54.520 --> 28:57.808
You know, like when your satnav
doesn't know a new road.

28:58.280 --> 28:59.441
So they can't come here?

28:59.600 --> 29:00.761
Not without a floor plan.

29:02.600 --> 29:03.601
Good.

29:04.280 --> 29:05.725
What happened to the Doctor?

29:05.800 --> 29:07.086
- I thought I saw...
- Yeah, he...

29:07.640 --> 29:09.210
The Doctor took you to safety.

29:09.280 --> 29:10.611
He gave you his helmet.

29:11.200 --> 29:12.850
- He died?
- He should have done.

29:13.960 --> 29:15.166
Don't know how he survived.

29:18.480 --> 29:19.970
Listen. About the Doctor...

29:20.480 --> 29:23.643
He walked in a vacuum for far too long.

29:23.720 --> 29:25.210
He's mostly okay,

29:26.400 --> 29:27.401
but he paid a price.

29:27.480 --> 29:28.481
What do you mean?

29:28.920 --> 29:30.160
He's in Section 12.

29:43.680 --> 29:44.681
Doctor?

29:48.440 --> 29:49.441
Bill.

29:50.560 --> 29:51.561
You're up.

29:51.720 --> 29:52.721
You're blind.

29:52.800 --> 29:56.009
I am? Oh, that explains
the bruised shins.

29:57.200 --> 29:59.168
Oh, don't go all gooey on me.

29:59.920 --> 30:00.921
It's temporary.

30:01.000 --> 30:02.411
- Really?
- Yeah.

30:03.040 --> 30:04.804
- Once we get back to the TARDIS...
- The TARDIS?

30:05.240 --> 30:07.481
Mmm. I've got stuff in there
that'll cure anything.

30:07.840 --> 30:10.286
Failing that, I think I've got some
spare eyes somewhere.

30:10.400 --> 30:11.731
They're from a lizard,
but I'm sure they'll fit.

30:12.760 --> 30:14.842
So, erm, until then...

30:15.200 --> 30:16.201
Until then what?

30:16.600 --> 30:18.443
You really think
this is going to slow me down?

30:19.160 --> 30:21.447
I do most of my best work
ordering other people around.

30:21.520 --> 30:24.444
You do know we're still here, right?

30:24.520 --> 30:26.124
Mining station Chasm Forge...

30:26.200 --> 30:27.850
Didn't I send you out to get me a latte?

30:29.480 --> 30:30.641
So what's the plan?

30:31.280 --> 30:34.841
Well, we've all been trying to get
a radio working and the Doctor's been...

30:36.480 --> 30:37.481
Thinking.

30:37.680 --> 30:40.160
Don't mean to hurry you,
but in 700 breaths, I'll be dead.

30:40.960 --> 30:42.166
I need to think.

30:49.600 --> 30:51.489
He really doesn't like help.

30:55.440 --> 30:56.487
It's a transponder.

30:57.320 --> 30:58.526
From a ship.

31:08.760 --> 31:10.967
Doctor, you okay?

31:14.000 --> 31:17.288
Bill, I've got no TARDIS, no sonic,
about 10 minutes' oxygen left,

31:18.040 --> 31:19.121
And now I'm blind.

31:20.160 --> 31:22.970
Can you imagine how unbearable
I'm going to be when I pull this off?

31:23.520 --> 31:24.646
Don't do this.

31:25.080 --> 31:26.206
You always do this.

31:26.480 --> 31:27.481
Do what?

31:27.760 --> 31:30.411
Make jokes to distract me
from whatever's about to kill us.

31:30.840 --> 31:32.001
What else are jokes for?

31:32.080 --> 31:33.127
Doctor!

31:33.280 --> 31:35.009
There's a rescue ship on the way.

31:35.080 --> 31:37.082
We've picked up a company transponder.

31:37.160 --> 31:38.525
If there's a rescue ship
on the way,

31:38.600 --> 31:40.568
then how can the rescue ship
already be here?

31:40.800 --> 31:42.006
Too many rescue ships.

31:42.640 --> 31:43.641
It's a first world problem.

31:43.880 --> 31:44.881
Who are you?

31:50.680 --> 31:51.681
I'm the Doctor.

31:52.160 --> 31:55.004
I will do everything in my power
to save all your lives, and when I do,

31:55.520 --> 31:57.648
you will spend the rest of them
wondering who I was,

31:58.120 --> 31:59.246
and why I helped you.

32:00.560 --> 32:02.369
If anyone's offering a better deal,
be my guest.

32:02.640 --> 32:03.926
You didn't save Tasker, did you?

32:04.640 --> 32:05.641
And he believed you.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.650
Trusted you.

32:07.720 --> 32:08.801
And now he's dead.

32:10.040 --> 32:13.681
Can you give me one good reason
why you shouldn't join him?

32:13.760 --> 32:15.967
Whoa, whoa, we're all getting
a little punchy here.

32:16.040 --> 32:18.088
It's the oxygen thinning.
It's making it harder to think.

32:18.160 --> 32:19.321
Instruction received.

32:19.400 --> 32:20.890
- You get out of my way.
- Complying.

32:20.960 --> 32:23.930
Please remain calm while
your central nervous system is disabled.

32:24.360 --> 32:26.567
Your life is in our hands.

32:26.640 --> 32:28.290
Head to the reactor core. Run!

32:29.200 --> 32:30.929
- What's happening?
- Guess.

32:36.360 --> 32:37.930
They knew we were there somehow.

32:38.360 --> 32:39.805
Voice rec. Had to be.

32:41.560 --> 32:43.164
Doctor? Doctor, my suit!

32:43.400 --> 32:44.481
It's doing it again.

32:44.840 --> 32:46.126
I... I can't move.

32:47.560 --> 32:50.006
The sequencer'sjammed.
Needs a reboot.

32:50.080 --> 32:51.889
- How long will that take?
- Too long.

32:52.120 --> 32:54.009
Okay, we'll pick her up, come on.

32:55.120 --> 32:57.248
Warning.
This is an illegal manoeuver.

32:57.320 --> 32:59.129
The suit won't let us.
Health and safety.

32:59.200 --> 33:00.281
Health and safety?

33:01.000 --> 33:02.001
Doctor?

33:02.080 --> 33:04.560
Okay, get her out of the suit.
Give her mine.

33:04.640 --> 33:07.041
The sequencer controls the release
clamps. We can't get her out.

33:07.120 --> 33:08.690
Well, we can't leave her here.
They'll kill her!

33:08.760 --> 33:11.764
Please do not interfere
with the operation of this suit.

33:11.840 --> 33:13.001
Fines may be incurred.

33:13.080 --> 33:14.809
Great, I get fined for dying.

33:14.920 --> 33:16.160
Fined for dying.

33:18.480 --> 33:19.481
Doctor?

33:19.760 --> 33:21.569
What if there was never a hack?

33:22.320 --> 33:25.688
What if this is just business?
Business as usual?

33:26.080 --> 33:27.206
What do you mean?

33:28.400 --> 33:30.402
Bill. Bill, do you trust me?

33:30.480 --> 33:31.811
Why are you saying that?

33:31.880 --> 33:33.291
We're gonna have to leave you here.

33:33.840 --> 33:34.887
What?

33:35.320 --> 33:36.845
- I'll die.
- You're not gonna die.

33:37.040 --> 33:39.088
But I won't lie to you.
This will not be good.

33:39.160 --> 33:40.525
We have to go, now.

33:40.840 --> 33:41.921
You will go through hell.

33:42.000 --> 33:44.401
But you will come through it
and I will be waiting on the other side.

33:44.480 --> 33:45.845
But if I was going to die...

33:45.920 --> 33:48.321
- You are not going to die!
- Wouldn't you just say exactly the same?

33:50.400 --> 33:52.323
I will see you soon.

33:53.360 --> 33:55.408
Could you just tell me
a joke before you go?

33:57.560 --> 33:59.289
Would you just tell me a joke?

34:00.800 --> 34:02.609
He didn't tell me a joke.

34:03.520 --> 34:05.124
Is that a good thing or a bad thing?

34:05.640 --> 34:07.005
Mum, answer me!

34:14.400 --> 34:16.687
Instruction received. Complying.

34:17.199 --> 34:19.885
Please remain calm while
your central nervous system is disabled.

34:21.159 --> 34:23.242
Your life is in our hands.

34:52.280 --> 34:54.282
Doctor, this isn't gonna work.

34:54.360 --> 34:55.600
Isn't it?

34:56.440 --> 34:57.487
Why, what do you think I'm doing?

34:58.240 --> 34:59.287
Electrolysis.

34:59.360 --> 35:00.930
Splitting water into hydrogen
and oxygen.

35:01.360 --> 35:02.725
Oh, that's clever.

35:02.920 --> 35:04.285
I wish I could see me doing that.

35:04.560 --> 35:06.608
Doctor, that water is cooling
the nuclear core.

35:07.000 --> 35:11.005
We'd enjoy five minutes of oxygen before
the whole thing overheated and blew.

35:11.120 --> 35:14.249
Yes, five whole minutes.

35:15.480 --> 35:16.970
We could boil the hell out of an egg.

35:18.800 --> 35:20.211
Stop being such a quitter.

35:21.160 --> 35:23.925
Doctor, it wasn't your fault.
You couldn't have saved her.

35:25.520 --> 35:27.170
Do you know what's wrong
with this universe?

35:27.480 --> 35:29.642
Believe me, I've looked into it.

35:30.640 --> 35:34.440
Everyone says it's not their fault.

35:34.800 --> 35:37.007
Well, yes, it is.

35:37.400 --> 35:40.802
All of it. It's all your fault.

35:40.880 --> 35:42.166
So what are you gonna do about it?

35:42.240 --> 35:44.891
There's nothing we can do. She's dead.

35:46.560 --> 35:50.201
She's no more dead than you are,
than I am,

35:50.600 --> 35:52.284
than everyone on this station is.

35:53.520 --> 35:54.726
Get me to a keyboard.

35:54.800 --> 35:56.086
What? Why?

35:56.160 --> 35:57.969
Because I'm not trying
to make oxygen. Keyboard.

35:58.320 --> 35:59.970
Now. Please.

36:01.080 --> 36:02.445
You think you have a plan?

36:02.920 --> 36:04.490
We've got exactly one plan left.

36:04.560 --> 36:06.244
- What plan?
- The big one.

36:06.480 --> 36:08.244
The one that you've been waiting for
all your life.

36:08.320 --> 36:09.560
What's he doing?

36:09.640 --> 36:11.005
Cooling system again.

36:11.400 --> 36:14.006
Yes.
I've rejigged it a tiny little bit.

36:14.280 --> 36:15.964
Either that, or I've really
screwed up the plumbing.

36:16.040 --> 36:17.087
It's tough when you're blind.

36:17.160 --> 36:18.321
We need to know about this plan.

36:18.400 --> 36:19.606
Uh-huh.

36:19.680 --> 36:22.445
The nice thing about life is,
however bad it gets,

36:22.520 --> 36:25.000
there's always one
last option available.

36:27.200 --> 36:28.247
Dying well.

36:28.920 --> 36:29.921
No.

36:30.720 --> 36:31.721
No!

36:31.800 --> 36:33.290
- What? What is it?
- Our life signs.

36:33.360 --> 36:34.930
He's wired them to the cooling system.

36:35.120 --> 36:36.770
If we die, it vents.

36:37.800 --> 36:39.882
When the suits kill us,
and they are going to kill us,

36:40.280 --> 36:43.284
the core will blow
and the whole station will be destroyed.

36:43.360 --> 36:44.691
One very big boom.

36:45.600 --> 36:47.170
Is that really the best you've got?

36:47.320 --> 36:48.367
Revenge?

36:48.840 --> 36:50.683
Not just revenge.

36:51.400 --> 36:53.289
It's revenge as bright as the sun.

36:54.600 --> 36:57.171
It's revenge you can
see across galaxies.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.207
Not bad for a blind man.

37:00.640 --> 37:02.085
He's locked us out of the subroutine.

37:02.200 --> 37:03.725
Oh, I'm sorry, I just thought
I was tweeting.

37:04.080 --> 37:05.286
They're through the third lock.

37:05.480 --> 37:06.527
Open the doors.

37:06.720 --> 37:07.801
Are you out of your mind?

37:08.520 --> 37:11.000
Ah, yes. Completely.
But that's not a recent thing.

37:11.280 --> 37:14.170
Listen.
All we've got left is a good death.

37:14.720 --> 37:17.087
This is the moment you've been waiting
for since the day you were born.

37:17.560 --> 37:18.686
Don't screw it up now.

37:18.760 --> 37:20.285
There's rescue ships on the way.

37:20.360 --> 37:21.361
No, there isn't!

37:22.560 --> 37:23.561
No, there isn't.

37:25.720 --> 37:27.768
There never was a rescue ship.

37:28.120 --> 37:29.121
What are you talking about?

37:29.200 --> 37:30.201
There was no hacking.

37:30.280 --> 37:31.281
No malfunction.

37:31.360 --> 37:35.684
The suits are doing
exactly what they were designed to do.

37:35.760 --> 37:38.001
What your employers
are telling them to do.

37:38.080 --> 37:39.081
And what would that be?

37:39.480 --> 37:42.086
Save the oxygen that you are wasting.

37:42.520 --> 37:44.045
You've become inefficient.

37:45.040 --> 37:46.166
You even told me.

37:47.360 --> 37:48.566
Your conveyors are down.

37:49.200 --> 37:50.440
So everyone had to die?

37:50.640 --> 37:54.326
Ha. Well, you are just organic
components

37:54.400 --> 37:55.970
and you're no longer efficient.

37:56.080 --> 37:57.650
So you're being thrown away.
You don't believe me?

37:58.440 --> 38:00.442
Check on that rescue ship.
Access the log.

38:00.520 --> 38:01.726
No, not true.

38:01.800 --> 38:03.643
None of it. You...
You are just a lunatic.

38:04.560 --> 38:05.800
It is true, Abby.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.445
The ship...

38:08.520 --> 38:10.602
It set off before the distress call.

38:12.520 --> 38:13.601
They're not your rescuers.

38:14.240 --> 38:15.366
They're your replacements.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.570
The end point of capitalism.

38:18.520 --> 38:19.681
The bottom line,

38:19.760 --> 38:22.604
where human life has no value at all.

38:23.200 --> 38:24.725
We're fighting an algorithm.

38:25.440 --> 38:26.566
A spreadsheet.

38:26.880 --> 38:28.530
Like every worker, everywhere.

38:29.120 --> 38:30.326
We're fighting the suits.

38:30.440 --> 38:32.329
They're nearly through!

38:33.560 --> 38:34.607
Open up.

38:35.200 --> 38:36.247
Let's send them a message.

38:36.320 --> 38:38.607
Let's teach them a lesson
they will never forget.

38:39.720 --> 38:41.484
If they take our lives,

38:41.560 --> 38:44.609
we take their station, and every penny
they will ever make from it.

38:45.240 --> 38:46.401
Die well.

38:46.760 --> 38:48.046
It's the finish line.

38:48.440 --> 38:49.521
It's winning.

38:51.240 --> 38:52.241
Open it.

39:02.840 --> 39:04.080
Doctor.

39:04.800 --> 39:06.040
- Doctor.
- What?

39:06.680 --> 39:07.886
It's Bill.

39:08.600 --> 39:09.840
Of course, it's Bill.

39:10.360 --> 39:12.169
Fate and me, we have a thing.
Hello, suits!

39:14.360 --> 39:16.806
Our deaths will be brave
and brilliant and unafraid,

39:17.720 --> 39:20.405
but above all, suits,
our deaths will be...

39:21.200 --> 39:22.486
Expensive!

39:27.880 --> 39:29.211
Check your readings.

39:29.880 --> 39:33.805
We die, your precious station dies.

39:34.240 --> 39:35.685
The whole thing will blow.

39:36.440 --> 39:39.330
The company will make
the biggest loss in its history.

39:40.040 --> 39:42.611
A moment ago,
we were too expensive to live.

39:42.920 --> 39:44.684
Now we're more expensive dead.

39:44.960 --> 39:46.371
Welcome to the rest of your lives.

39:46.800 --> 39:48.245
But you said that we were gonna die.

39:48.480 --> 39:51.643
Ah, technically,
I said you were as dead as Bill.

39:51.920 --> 39:54.241
Probably should have mentioned,
Bill's not dead.

39:59.400 --> 40:01.050
I saw earlier,
her suit battery was too low.

40:01.720 --> 40:03.404
Not enough for a lethal close.

40:03.480 --> 40:05.130
I know what it takes to kill someone.

40:06.120 --> 40:07.121
Ellie.

40:11.600 --> 40:12.726
What are they doing?

40:13.320 --> 40:14.321
Relax.

40:14.920 --> 40:16.365
They're giving us their oxygen.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.161
Good for business.

40:18.240 --> 40:20.242
Well, I'm not sure
I'm very happy about it.

40:28.200 --> 40:29.361
Thank you.

40:34.720 --> 40:35.721
It worked.

40:36.520 --> 40:37.567
- Doctor.
- Yeah.

40:38.160 --> 40:39.207
I think I'm alive.

40:39.840 --> 40:42.047
Yep, you do seem to be
under that impression.

40:53.240 --> 40:54.401
Glad, though.

40:58.200 --> 41:00.362
Okay, keep your eyes open.

41:01.200 --> 41:03.248
Keep them open up there. That's it.

41:03.760 --> 41:06.366
You could have told us
your actual plan in the first place.

41:07.240 --> 41:10.210
I could have told Bill
her battery was too weak to kill her.

41:10.640 --> 41:11.971
But the suits would have heard.

41:12.720 --> 41:15.121
I try never to tell the enemy
my secret plan.

41:15.560 --> 41:17.642
Ah. Better?

41:18.760 --> 41:19.761
Hmm.

41:21.440 --> 41:22.441
Ah.

41:22.840 --> 41:25.002
We're back in the TARDIS.
When did that happen?

41:26.520 --> 41:27.601
Thank you, Doctor.

41:28.520 --> 41:29.567
For all that you've done.

41:29.880 --> 41:31.484
I'm sorry that I didn't have
more faith in your methods.

41:31.560 --> 41:32.641
Ah, don't mention it.

41:33.160 --> 41:37.051
Now, I can set you down on a hub-world
outside of corporate control.

41:37.640 --> 41:39.483
Or anywhere, really.

41:40.360 --> 41:42.522
The universe is your crustacean.

41:45.200 --> 41:47.567
Head Office.
We've got a complaint to make.

41:49.560 --> 41:51.005
I think we can arrange that.

41:55.400 --> 41:56.526
Promise me you'll be loud.

41:56.840 --> 41:58.046
Promise.

42:14.840 --> 42:16.080
Does it work?

42:16.160 --> 42:17.241
Does what work?

42:17.720 --> 42:18.881
Making a complaint to Head Office?

42:19.360 --> 42:20.964
No idea. I've never had a Head Office.

42:22.120 --> 42:24.487
But as far as I remember,
there's a successful rebellion

42:24.560 --> 42:25.607
six months later.

42:26.360 --> 42:28.203
Corporate dominance in space is history.

42:29.120 --> 42:30.531
And that about wraps it for capitalists.

42:30.640 --> 42:31.766
Hey.

42:31.840 --> 42:34.571
Then the human race
finds a whole new mistake.

42:35.840 --> 42:36.966
But that's another story.

42:37.280 --> 42:38.884
- Can't wait.
- But you will.

42:40.960 --> 42:41.961
Laters.

42:44.160 --> 42:45.161
Laters.

42:51.880 --> 42:53.041
Never again.

42:54.760 --> 42:56.171
Stop talking. Now.

42:56.520 --> 42:57.646
I'm serious.

42:57.720 --> 43:00.200
We were so close to not making it back.

43:00.920 --> 43:02.046
Then what happens to the vault?

43:03.480 --> 43:05.130
You know what's at stake here.

43:05.960 --> 43:07.246
Really, stop talking.

43:07.920 --> 43:09.001
What if you got killed out there?

43:09.440 --> 43:11.920
Huh? What happens
to your precious Earth then?

43:12.840 --> 43:16.845
You need to be here and you need
to be ready if that door ever opens.

43:17.760 --> 43:19.000
- Look at me.
- I can't.

43:19.560 --> 43:22.006
What if you came back injured? Or sick?

43:22.800 --> 43:25.565
You really think our friend down there
won't know that?

43:25.640 --> 43:26.721
Won't sense it?

43:28.400 --> 43:29.447
Look at me!

43:29.520 --> 43:31.329
Nardole, I can't. I really can't.

43:33.800 --> 43:36.531
I can't look at anything ever again.

43:37.440 --> 43:39.283
I'm still blind.

44:11.360 --> 44:14.603
The Pope requests most urgently
a personal audience.

44:15.280 --> 44:17.647
The Veritas contains a secret.

44:17.800 --> 44:20.531
Everyone who worked on the translation
is now dead.

44:20.640 --> 44:23.041
You're blind
and you don't want your enemies to know.

44:23.120 --> 44:25.009
But why does it have to be a secret
from Bill?

44:25.280 --> 44:26.361
You happy in those shades?

44:26.440 --> 44:27.680
In darkness we are revealed.

44:28.320 --> 44:30.926
Very few know this place exists.

44:31.400 --> 44:32.401
The Haereticum.

44:32.560 --> 44:34.528
Something's coming, Bill.
Something very big.

44:35.440 --> 44:38.091
And something possibly very, very bad.

44:38.400 --> 44:40.721
How can I save them
when I'm lost in the dark?
