Czy nie mo¿emy po prostu wys³aæ kierowcê?

02:41.528 --> 02:43.735
To S¹ przyjaciele,nie goœcie.

02:43.797 --> 02:45.538
Did you remind Tim
that the people are coming

02:45.599 --> 02:47.010
with the new furniture?

02:47.067 --> 02:48.569
Oh.

02:48.635 --> 02:52.549
Sweetie, can you pretend
that we're running a business?

02:52.606 --> 02:56.645
If I wanted to work, I would
have stayed in New York.

02:56.710 --> 02:59.714
I'm going
I'm going

03:19.332 --> 03:24.645
Hey buddy, the new furniture
should be here in about an hour.

03:24.704 --> 03:26.706
You're gonna have
to sign for it, okay?

03:26.773 --> 03:28.081
Okay.

03:43.223 --> 03:47.433
You know, I don't know
why someone who spent

03:47.494 --> 03:52.671
4 years in pre-med would wanna
become a doctor of divinity

03:52.732 --> 03:56.111
instead of a real doctor.

03:56.169 --> 03:58.581
You could really help
some people, you know?

03:58.638 --> 04:02.609
I wanna help
people with this.

04:06.746 --> 04:13.459
I tell ya what, why don't
you just forget everything,

04:13.520 --> 04:16.500
stay with us here
in paradise?

04:21.661 --> 04:25.006
I wanna help other
people find paradise.

04:25.065 --> 04:28.740
Yeah, stepped in it
that time, huh?

04:28.802 --> 04:32.113
Oh, there's my
master's voice.

04:32.172 --> 04:33.617
See ya later.

04:35.442 --> 04:36.716
Christopher!

04:36.777 --> 04:38.757
Yup, yup,
yup, yup, YUP

04:40.180 --> 04:42.057
Sorry, honey.
I told him.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.061
See ya, son.

06:02.162 --> 06:03.436
Chu.

06:03.496 --> 06:06.238
I got him.

06:06.299 --> 06:08.711
He's outside of Deville's.

06:08.768 --> 06:10.714
<i>You have a positive ID?</i>

06:10.770 --> 06:12.841
<i>Yup.</i>

06:12.906 --> 06:15.079
<i>It's him.</i>

06:15.141 --> 06:18.645
Is he
carrying any suitcases?

06:18.712 --> 06:20.282
No.

06:20.347 --> 06:21.917
<i>Well, you hold your position.</i>

06:21.982 --> 06:23.518
I'll have a team there
in a half-hour.

06:23.583 --> 06:26.120
<i>Half an hour?
He could be gone in 5 minutes.</i>

06:26.186 --> 06:27.460
Let me take him now.

06:27.520 --> 06:29.591
<i>That's a negative.</i>

06:29.656 --> 06:32.603
<i>I only want this guy
carrying drugs or money.</i>

06:32.659 --> 06:34.002
<i>That's not necessary.</i>

06:34.060 --> 06:35.334
<i>We've got
a fugitive warrant.</i>

06:35.395 --> 06:37.238
He's been indicted
on two RICO cases.

06:37.297 --> 06:39.140
And he's gonna
walk on both.

06:39.199 --> 06:40.507
I want this guy.

06:40.567 --> 06:42.103
<i>We need hard evidence.</i>

06:42.168 --> 06:43.875
<i>I want him in jail.</i>

06:43.937 --> 06:47.578
You stay in your car
and you just watch him.

07:15.835 --> 07:17.143
<i>What's up?</i>

07:19.806 --> 07:21.786
See that guy
over there?

07:26.112 --> 07:27.386
<i>What guy?</i>

07:27.447 --> 07:28.824
<i>The white
guy with the beard</i>

07:30.984 --> 07:34.898
I think you and I are the
only two whites around here.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.992
What's wrong?
Someone you recognize?

07:37.057 --> 07:39.435
No.

07:39.492 --> 07:41.529
But he seemed
to know me.

08:41.187 --> 08:45.363
This is all you'll need.

08:45.425 --> 08:50.431
<i>Cameron will meet you
at the Anantara Resort.</i>

08:50.497 --> 08:53.137
<i>It's a lovely place, although
it's taken on the stench</i>

08:53.199 --> 08:55.645
of death as of late.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.579
Cameron will provide you
with police protection

08:57.637 --> 09:02.245
as long as you're
in the providence.

09:02.308 --> 09:05.289
But once you're out of here,
you're on your own.

09:07.614 --> 09:11.221
I hear that this is
your last shipment.

09:11.284 --> 09:13.594
May I ask why?

09:13.653 --> 09:16.224
I had enough.

09:16.289 --> 09:18.291
You've had enough?

09:18.358 --> 09:22.898
Well, that makes you
a very dangerous man, Bruno.

09:22.962 --> 09:27.069
<i>Our entire society's
built on having more,</i>

09:27.133 --> 09:32.242
<i>bigger house, faster car,
more beautiful woman.</i>

09:32.305 --> 09:35.081
<i>What if everyone decided
they'd had enough?</i>

09:35.141 --> 09:39.112
<i>Our entire world order
would come tumbling down.</i>

09:41.347 --> 09:44.226
The day you have enough, Bruno,
is the day you die.

09:44.284 --> 09:48.130
<i>If I didn't
know you better...</i>

09:48.188 --> 09:51.169
I'd call that a threat.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.462
Sound like a threat
to you, Charlie?

09:54.527 --> 09:56.871
Sounds like a threat
to me, Bruno.

09:56.930 --> 10:01.845
<i>I bet you want
more, Charlie, don't you?</i>

10:01.901 --> 10:04.882
A little more
never hurt anybody.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.249
White man.

10:10.076 --> 10:11.384
It's Caperna.

10:17.917 --> 10:19.897
See you around, Deville.

10:21.554 --> 10:22.862
Bye, Bruno.

10:34.968 --> 10:36.743
<i>Vaya con Dios.</i>

11:10.270 --> 11:11.613
Here,
take the phone.

11:11.671 --> 11:12.945
Wait for me
at the hotel.

11:13.006 --> 11:15.179
- Here, you take this.
- No, you keep it.

11:15.241 --> 11:17.380
Go ahead.

13:36.215 --> 13:39.128
What took you so long?

13:49.495 --> 13:50.769
Release him.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.104
What, what?
Wait, wait.

13:52.165 --> 13:53.906
What do you-
what do you think you're doing?

13:53.967 --> 13:55.241
I'm releasing this man.

13:55.301 --> 13:56.837
We have no evidence
he's committed any crime

13:56.903 --> 13:58.177
in this country.

13:58.237 --> 13:59.978
He's wanted in the
United States of the America.

14:00.039 --> 14:05.011
<i>Do you have an
international arrest warrant?</i>

14:05.078 --> 14:07.024
I'm sure we do,
back at the office.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.060
But you don't
have it here.

14:12.151 --> 14:13.824
Sir,
you're free to go.

14:13.886 --> 14:15.331
Thank you.

14:15.388 --> 14:16.765
See ya around,
Ricky boy.

14:16.823 --> 14:18.427
Wait, you can't
release him!

14:18.491 --> 14:20.562
I've been chasing
him for 5 years!

14:20.626 --> 14:21.900
You bring me
the right paperwork,

14:21.961 --> 14:23.463
I'll pick him up
for you.

14:23.529 --> 14:24.803
How much is he
paying you?

14:24.864 --> 14:26.138
You're under arrest.

14:26.199 --> 14:27.473
Arrest me?
Arrest you!

14:27.533 --> 14:28.807
How much are
they paying you?!

14:28.868 --> 14:30.313
Take him away.

14:30.370 --> 14:31.678
Ugh!

14:51.724 --> 14:53.226
Well, that didn't
take long.

14:53.292 --> 14:57.172
We need to be packed up
and out of here in 5 minutes.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.675
Let's go.

15:13.579 --> 15:14.853
<i>Where is it?</i>

15:14.914 --> 15:16.188
There isn't any more.

15:16.249 --> 15:17.523
You've got
to get me some.

15:17.583 --> 15:19.529
Next week you'll have enough
to dive into head first,

15:19.585 --> 15:21.531
but rig ht now I need you to
pull yourself together.

15:21.587 --> 15:22.930
<i>We have to get
out of here.</i>

15:22.989 --> 15:24.730
Don't you care
that I'm hurting?

15:24.791 --> 15:27.465
Come on, Mimi,
I don't have time to explain!

18:07.920 --> 18:10.730
It's been longer
than a half-hour.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.428
You should consider
yourself lucky

18:12.491 --> 18:14.368
<i>that they're letting
you go at all.</i>

18:14.427 --> 18:16.998
<i>You punched
a police inspector.</i>

18:17.063 --> 18:20.567
Yeah, well,
he was corrupt.

18:20.633 --> 18:22.704
You try pulling it.

18:26.172 --> 18:27.742
Where's my gun?

18:27.807 --> 18:31.482
<i>It's con?scated.</i>

18:31.544 --> 18:36.823
But here's your flight
to Los Angeles.

18:39.652 --> 18:42.360
It's a condition
of your release.

18:42.421 --> 18:46.369
<i>And if you ever want this back,
you will get on that plane.</i>

18:46.425 --> 18:49.497
I'm not letting him
slip away again.

18:49.562 --> 18:53.032
He's long gone.

18:53.099 --> 18:56.205
I'll see about that.

18:58.170 --> 19:01.947
Get back here.

19:02.008 --> 19:03.646
Get back-

19:08.614 --> 19:11.254
Consider yourself suspended.

19:17.657 --> 19:20.729
<i>Ah, Special Agent Caperna,</i>

19:20.793 --> 19:25.640
<i>or should! say former
Special Agent Caperna?</i>

19:25.698 --> 19:27.678
Can I get you a drink?

19:29.435 --> 19:30.914
No, thanks.

19:30.970 --> 19:32.643
That's rig ht.

19:32.705 --> 19:34.946
You don't drink.
You don't smoke.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.509
You don't gamble.

19:36.575 --> 19:41.854
Your only vice is your
hatred of drug dealers.

19:41.914 --> 19:47.523
<i>I'm just wondering what you
plan to offer me for Bruno.</i>

19:47.586 --> 19:53.593
You're under suspension, so you
can't offer me legal immunity.

19:53.659 --> 19:57.539
You don't have a gun,
so you can't threaten me.

19:57.597 --> 20:00.544
<i>Ha, ha, ha.</i>

20:00.599 --> 20:03.239
Cheer up,
today's your lucky day.

20:03.302 --> 20:07.250
Mr. McGrilly has outlived
his usefulness for me

20:07.306 --> 20:11.220
<i>so I can offer you a sizable
discount in the hopes that we</i>

20:11.277 --> 20:17.250
can have a more permanent
relationship in the future.

20:24.824 --> 20:28.362
This is on the house.

20:44.944 --> 20:48.687
<i>Sometimes
I just love my job.</i>

20:48.748 --> 20:51.194
<i>Ha, ha, ha,
ha, ha, ha.</i>

22:07.593 --> 22:09.732
Have you seen Chris?

22:20.339 --> 22:22.615
<i>It's coming.</i>

22:22.675 --> 22:23.983
Yeah.

22:25.811 --> 22:30.521
It'll be here
in a couple hours.

22:30.583 --> 22:32.563
I'll be with you soon.

22:34.420 --> 22:36.457
Dad-

22:36.522 --> 22:38.502
One way or another.

22:43.028 --> 22:44.735
<i>Christopher!</i>

22:49.134 --> 22:50.670
Christopher!

22:54.874 --> 22:56.581
Christopher!

23:02.381 --> 23:05.885
Christopher-

23:05.951 --> 23:08.898
You're impossible.

23:08.954 --> 23:11.628
Aroon took the rest of the
staff to the evacuation center.

23:11.690 --> 23:16.537
He'll be back for
us in 20 minutes.

23:16.595 --> 23:19.667
<i>I'm not going.</i>

23:19.732 --> 23:23.703
The storm is gonna
tear this place apart.

23:37.383 --> 23:43.356
Well, I'm going, but not
to the evacuation center.

23:45.024 --> 23:47.561
I'm going to Bangkok.

23:47.626 --> 23:52.871
I'm gonna take the first
flight out to New York

23:52.932 --> 23:56.903
and I'm gonna
file for divorce.

24:00.773 --> 24:05.745
<i>Helen, reopen our
house in Los Angeles, huh?</i>

24:08.013 --> 24:11.290
Community property laws
are better there.

24:29.335 --> 24:32.805
It's okay.

24:32.871 --> 24:35.852
We're not gonna
get divorced.

24:39.111 --> 24:41.990
I have something
else in mind.

25:06.572 --> 25:09.018
<i>Don't give up hope.</i>

26:31.323 --> 26:33.963
Don't worry, son.

26:34.026 --> 26:37.235
She'll get over it,

26:37.296 --> 26:40.539
same way she
got over you.

26:53.379 --> 26:55.689
<i>Put the gun down.</i>

27:12.898 --> 27:16.436
You okay, baby?

27:16.502 --> 27:20.450
<i>Mimi?</i>

27:27.980 --> 27:29.653
Ric's gonna be there.

27:29.715 --> 27:33.356
Just let him take out Bruno
and then you kill him,

27:33.419 --> 27:36.059
and then it's
all yours, Charlie.

27:38.690 --> 27:40.328
Who is it?

27:40.392 --> 27:44.431
<i>It's no one, just a girl.</i>

27:44.496 --> 27:46.032
Which one?

27:46.098 --> 27:48.669
You mean they have
individual names?

28:25.037 --> 28:26.482
Are you an American?

28:26.538 --> 28:28.848
Yeah, what are
you doing here?

28:28.907 --> 28:30.181
<i>My name is Ric Caperna.</i>

28:30.242 --> 28:32.654
I'm special agent with the
Drug Enforcement Administration.

28:32.711 --> 28:33.985
You have any
guests here now?

28:34.046 --> 28:37.653
No, we evacuated our guests
yesterday and our staff today.

28:37.716 --> 28:38.990
Can you
show me around?

28:39.051 --> 28:41.429
Sure, this way.

29:07.179 --> 29:10.319
<i>Charlie,
check out the place.</i>

29:43.882 --> 29:45.190
Get down!

30:22.487 --> 30:25.195
<i>Helen, we've
gotta get out of here.</i>

32:33.485 --> 32:38.298
<i>Ric, don't make
me hurt these nice people</i>

32:47.766 --> 32:49.905
<i>Put the gun down, Ric.
Come on.</i>

32:59.110 --> 33:01.090
<i>Put your gun down!</i>

33:06.384 --> 33:07.920
<i>Come on.</i>

33:27.505 --> 33:28.813
<i>That's right.</i>

34:03.708 --> 34:06.780
<i>Not so tight, Charlie.</i>

34:06.845 --> 34:10.257
<i>I'd hate for Ric
to be uncomfortable.</i>

34:10.315 --> 34:13.295
May I ask
what's going on?

34:14.819 --> 34:18.527
What's going on
is irrelevant.

34:18.590 --> 34:21.571
What you really want to know
is if you and your wife

34:21.626 --> 34:25.574
are gonna be safe,
and the answer is yes,

34:25.630 --> 34:29.304
provided you do exactly
as you're told.

34:29.367 --> 34:31.313
What about him?

34:31.369 --> 34:33.645
Let me worry
about him.

34:33.705 --> 34:35.981
You ought to be worrying
about yourself, Bruno.

34:36.041 --> 34:37.349
Shut up, Caperna.

34:38.710 --> 34:40.018
Charlie!

34:48.786 --> 34:52.257
Ricky boy, behave yourself.

34:52.324 --> 34:55.237
You might just survive
this afternoon.

34:55.293 --> 35:00.538
Look,
let's all be friends.

35:00.599 --> 35:03.944
<i>I'm Bruno.</i>

35:04.002 --> 35:06.175
My wife, Mimi.

35:06.238 --> 35:09.879
<i>The over-eager,
Ric Caperna.</i>

35:09.941 --> 35:14.219
<i>My good friend Charlie.</i>

35:14.279 --> 35:16.020
And who are you?

35:16.081 --> 35:20.223
<i>Chris.
This is my wife, Helen.</i>

35:20.285 --> 35:21.559
<i>This your place?</i>

35:21.620 --> 35:23.793
- Yeah.
- Oh, nice.

35:23.855 --> 35:26.028
You did very nice.

35:26.091 --> 35:28.367
Don't worry,
we're not staying long.

35:28.426 --> 35:30.804
A few hours at most.

35:54.052 --> 36:00.833
<i>III</i>

36:00.892 --> 36:03.964
Chris, come here.

36:04.029 --> 36:05.337
Come here.

36:06.698 --> 36:08.678
Yeah, okay.

36:15.140 --> 36:17.746
Any of your staff
still around?

36:17.809 --> 36:19.117
No.

36:21.746 --> 36:23.054
You see that guy,
right?

36:31.489 --> 36:36.962
Who is he?

36:37.028 --> 36:40.237
The angel of death.

36:40.298 --> 36:45.077
He was here before the tsunami.
Now he's back again.

36:45.136 --> 36:46.809
Angel of death, huh?

36:46.871 --> 36:48.817
All right, go sit down.
Go ahead. Thanks.

36:48.873 --> 36:50.147
I'm gonna
take care of this.

36:50.208 --> 36:52.188
Yeah, be careful,
will ya?

36:57.082 --> 37:00.495
<i>What's wrong?</i>

37:00.552 --> 37:02.532
We're gonna die.

37:04.456 --> 37:08.427
It's not them
I'm worried about.

37:24.276 --> 37:27.553
<i>Sit down.
Just sit down.</i>

37:27.612 --> 37:29.592
<i>Have a seat, please.</i>

37:42.661 --> 37:44.641
Hi, Mimi.

37:49.567 --> 37:50.841
How'd you know
her name?

37:50.902 --> 37:52.404
<i>He knew mine too.</i>

37:52.470 --> 37:53.778
Hey.

37:56.741 --> 37:58.049
<i>Who are you?</i>

37:59.978 --> 38:02.219
I am that I am.

38:02.280 --> 38:04.021
You work for Kamal?

38:04.082 --> 38:07.222
<i>Let's ask an expert.</i>

38:07.285 --> 38:12.735
<i>Do I look like
a drug dealer, Ric?</i>

38:12.791 --> 38:16.399
Deville.

38:16.461 --> 38:19.874
<i>So that's where you got
your information, huh?</i>

38:19.931 --> 38:21.274
<i>Deville.</i>

38:21.333 --> 38:23.176
<i>You sold me out.</i>

38:23.234 --> 38:27.808
Your so-called friend has
only one love: bloodshed.

38:27.872 --> 38:33.481
And if he has his way,
none of you will survive today.

38:33.545 --> 38:36.287
- Let me kill this creep now.
- No, no, Charlie, no, no.

38:36.348 --> 38:37.793
<i>We don't even know him.</i>

38:37.849 --> 38:39.795
No, we don't.

38:39.851 --> 38:41.592
You have to nothing
to fear from me, Chris.

38:41.653 --> 38:45.362
I'm not the
angel of death.

38:45.423 --> 38:47.960
<i>Ask your wife, Helen.</i>

38:48.026 --> 38:49.699
<i>She knows me.</i>

38:49.761 --> 38:51.900
I've never
seen you before.

38:51.963 --> 38:55.877
<i>Well, that's
true you've never seen me,</i>

38:55.934 --> 38:59.177
but on the 137th day
of your 12th year,

38:59.237 --> 39:03.447
you gave your life to me,
small Presbyterian church

39:03.508 --> 39:08.150
<i>on Hartford Road
and Evergreen Avenue.</i>

39:08.213 --> 39:12.161
<i>Oh, since then you allowed
yourself to become</i>

39:12.217 --> 39:15.721
<i>a little strangled
by the cares of this world</i>

39:15.787 --> 39:20.327
<i>and the deceitfulness
of human wealth,</i>

39:20.391 --> 39:26.239
<i>but I never lost
sight of you, Helen.</i>

39:26.297 --> 39:30.268
<i>And I know the day is coming
when you will ?ourish.</i>

39:34.572 --> 39:37.109
<i>Come on, Bruno, let me
pop this guy now He's a loony.</i>

39:37.175 --> 39:39.849
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Charlie, please.

39:39.911 --> 39:42.721
<i>Don't pretend you've
never heard my voice, Charlie,</i>

39:42.781 --> 39:44.055
though it was
always filtered

39:44.115 --> 39:46.823
through your mother
and grandmother.

39:46.885 --> 39:48.421
<i>When you came forward
in your 9th year;</i>

39:48.486 --> 39:52.093
<i>you loved the smiles
on their faces,</i>

39:52.157 --> 39:56.663
but your heart proved to be
such rocky soil, Charlie.

39:56.728 --> 40:02.269
<i>Your friends called you sissy,
and you just caved in.</i>

40:02.333 --> 40:06.304
<i>You were always very prideful,
Charlie, even as a kid.</i>

40:10.008 --> 40:11.419
All right, come on.

40:11.476 --> 40:14.457
What's your game,
pal, huh?

40:14.512 --> 40:16.321
You work for
Deville or not?

40:16.381 --> 40:22.161
No, I don't work for Deville,
nor does Deville work for me.

40:22.220 --> 40:26.066
<i>He was outside the prison
yesterday when I was released</i>

40:26.124 --> 40:29.230
<i>You used
the wrong verb tense, Ric.</i>

40:29.294 --> 40:31.433
I wasn't outside
the jail yesterday.

40:31.496 --> 40:37.845
I am outside the jail now,
even as we speak.

40:37.902 --> 40:44.751
<i>The same way that I am on the
street outside Deville's of?ce.</i>

40:44.809 --> 40:50.191
Tell Charlie how you saw me,
"the bearded white guy. "

40:50.248 --> 40:52.159
I don't know what I saw,

40:52.216 --> 40:56.363
and I'm tired
of playing 20-Questions.

40:56.421 --> 40:57.729
Who are you?

40:59.757 --> 41:05.537
<i>III</i>

41:05.597 --> 41:06.905
I'm Jesus.

41:10.835 --> 41:12.143
<i>Chris t.</i>

41:15.273 --> 41:18.186
<i>Yeah, and I'm
the Virgin Mary.</i>

41:27.819 --> 41:30.299
That's it. That's it.
I've had enough.

41:30.355 --> 41:31.629
Calm down.
Calm down.

41:31.689 --> 41:32.963
What do you mean
calm down?!

41:33.024 --> 41:36.233
It's obvious he's escaped
from the local loony bin.

41:36.294 --> 41:39.104
You know, you're lucky
my mother's not here.

41:39.164 --> 41:42.543
She wouldn't let anyone
blaspheme, not even me.

41:42.600 --> 41:45.706
You're right, your mother's
a very Godly woman

41:45.770 --> 41:50.719
and she prays for you to come
to me every day, Charlie.

41:50.775 --> 41:53.085
Don't break your
mother's heart, Charlie.

41:53.144 --> 41:55.055
Shut up!
Just shut up!

41:55.113 --> 41:57.093
Give me your gun,
Charlie.

41:57.148 --> 41:58.650
<i>Give me your gun.</i>

42:01.719 --> 42:03.494
<i>Who is it?</i>

42:03.554 --> 42:04.862
Wrong number.

42:14.933 --> 42:20.906
Chris, you've done a great
job of restoring this hotel.

42:24.142 --> 42:27.385
It was Helen.

42:27.445 --> 42:30.551
If I had my way,
I would have left it a ruin,

42:30.615 --> 42:33.824
<i>a monument
to God's cruelty.</i>

42:33.885 --> 42:38.231
Do you think that's
the way Timothy sees it?

42:38.289 --> 42:42.965
<i>Anywhere he looked,
he saw my love.</i>

42:43.027 --> 42:45.667
I don't wanna
talk about him.

42:45.730 --> 42:48.734
<i>It's not true, Chris.</i>

42:48.800 --> 42:52.771
You've been wanting to talk
to me about him for years.

42:56.541 --> 42:58.487
You know, if you were
who you say you are,

42:58.543 --> 43:01.524
I'd punch you
square in the face.

43:04.515 --> 43:07.052
What happened?

43:07.118 --> 43:11.533
<i>Our son was killed
in the tsunami in 2004.</i>

43:11.589 --> 43:13.125
<i>That's terrible.</i>

43:13.191 --> 43:17.196
<i>How old was he?</i>

43:17.261 --> 43:19.537
He was 22.

43:19.597 --> 43:21.838
<i>$0 young.</i>

43:21.900 --> 43:25.109
<i>I don't think
I could bear that.</i>

43:25.169 --> 43:28.309
The only thing you can do
is just remind yourself

43:28.373 --> 43:30.216
that the pain
isn't real.

43:33.645 --> 43:36.489
<i>Mimi spent time in a
monastery where she was taught</i>

43:36.547 --> 43:40.256
<i>that all pain and suffering
are illusions.</i>

43:40.318 --> 43:43.788
Isn't that right, Mimi?

43:43.855 --> 43:45.163
Yes.

43:47.759 --> 43:52.936
Mimi, do you believe this pain
you're feeling now is real?

43:52.997 --> 43:54.271
No.

43:54.332 --> 43:56.608
Isn't real.

43:56.668 --> 44:00.707
But you feel it.

44:00.772 --> 44:05.221
Only because I haven't
achieved enlightenment yet.

44:05.276 --> 44:11.022
<i>Mimi, I am Jesus,</i>

44:11.082 --> 44:13.153
and I'll never tell you
that you're not hurting

44:13.217 --> 44:15.788
when you really are.

44:15.853 --> 44:20.825
I don't deny your pain,
and I'll never ignore it.

44:23.528 --> 44:28.238
I think it's better
if pain is just an illusion

44:28.299 --> 44:31.405
because if I thought what
I was feeling was real,

44:31.469 --> 44:34.211
I would kill myself.

44:34.272 --> 44:37.276
<i>Hey, baby, you don't have
to live like this, you know?</i>

44:37.341 --> 44:40.345
You can always
go back to rehab.

44:40.411 --> 44:43.756
Maybe she needs
a reason to face reality.

44:43.815 --> 44:46.762
What do you know?

44:46.818 --> 44:49.128
I know pain.

44:49.187 --> 44:51.861
It breaks my heart.

44:51.923 --> 44:56.565
<i>My hope for humankind was never
pain, suffering, and death.</i>

45:00.464 --> 45:03.741
<i>It's Kamal, your supplier.</i>

45:03.801 --> 45:07.749
<i>He's running late
because of the storm.</i>

45:07.805 --> 45:10.843
Oh, and don't worry
about the storm.

45:10.908 --> 45:13.889
<i>It's going to hit further
north along the coast.</i>

45:15.980 --> 45:17.960
This is him.

45:24.422 --> 45:26.402
Will you still
be here today?

45:29.527 --> 45:31.507
<i>Couple hours?</i>

45:36.133 --> 45:38.875
I can't wait a couple hours.
I'm dying.

45:38.936 --> 45:40.381
Look, I know you’re
hurting, baby.

45:40.438 --> 45:43.612
Look-listen to me, you're
halfway through detox now.

45:43.674 --> 45:46.416
If we stay the course
we can start again.

45:46.477 --> 45:50.653
We can start again clean.

45:50.715 --> 45:52.023
I'm gonna die!

45:52.083 --> 45:54.063
You're not going to die!

46:07.198 --> 46:10.645
What's wrong, Mimi?

46:10.701 --> 46:15.013
He doesn't understand
how badly I hurt.

46:15.072 --> 46:17.985
<i>That's too bad because
if he doesn't understand</i>

46:18.042 --> 46:19.612
the depth of your pain,

46:19.677 --> 46:25.059
he'll never appreciate
the height of your victory.

46:25.116 --> 46:28.620
What is victory?

46:28.686 --> 46:30.859
<i>Your triumph over drugs.</i>

46:30.922 --> 46:34.836
And more importantly,
finally finding the peace

46:34.892 --> 46:40.843
<i>and the security that you've
sought after your whole life.</i>

46:40.898 --> 46:43.879
Can I tell them
about your life?

46:46.404 --> 46:50.477
Mimi was born
in a tiny village.

46:50.541 --> 46:52.145
You could say
that even from birth

46:52.210 --> 46:55.214
she was a victim
of the drug trade.

46:55.279 --> 46:57.190
<i>Her father worked
in the poppy fields</i>

46:57.248 --> 47:01.924
<i>while her mother worked
in the processing plants.</i>

47:01.986 --> 47:04.626
They had no choice.

47:04.689 --> 47:06.828
We were so poor.

47:06.891 --> 47:12.739
You either worked the fields
or you starved.

47:12.797 --> 47:17.769
But-
they were good people.

47:17.835 --> 47:20.372
They loved me.

47:20.438 --> 47:23.817
They send me to school
at the monastery

47:23.874 --> 47:27.151
<i>so I would have
a better life.</i>

47:27.211 --> 47:28.849
<i>You loved it there.</i>

47:28.913 --> 47:30.586
<i>Yes.</i>

47:30.648 --> 47:32.628
<i>It's wonderful.</i>

47:38.356 --> 47:40.495
<i>What happened?</i>

47:40.558 --> 47:42.936
<i>Mimi's father
was wrongly accused</i>

47:42.994 --> 47:46.840
by the drug lord
of stealing.

47:46.898 --> 47:52.871
<i>The only payment
he would accept was Mimi.</i>

47:55.606 --> 47:57.244
They dragged her out
of the monastery

47:57.308 --> 47:59.686
and sold her to
a Bangkok brothel.

47:59.744 --> 48:02.691
<i>Don't tell them
about it, please.</i>

48:02.747 --> 48:05.887
<i>I won't.</i>

48:05.950 --> 48:07.930
<i>We skip to Bruno?</i>

48:10.922 --> 48:14.631
<i>For Bruno, it was
love at first sight.</i>

49:36.073 --> 49:39.646
<i>He couldn't bear
to see you working there,</i>

49:39.710 --> 49:44.716
<i>so he bought you
from the gangster.</i>

49:58.863 --> 50:04.313
At first I wasn't sure
what he was going to do.

50:04.368 --> 50:09.613
Whether he would
be like the others.

50:09.673 --> 50:12.620
I belong to him.

50:12.676 --> 50:18.490
He can use me, beat me,
put me on the street,

50:18.549 --> 50:23.726
but instead he freed me.

50:23.788 --> 50:25.927
<i>And the drugs?</i>

50:25.990 --> 50:31.463
<i>Dealers usually hook their
women so they can control ‘em.</i>

50:31.529 --> 50:34.510
Isn't that right, Bruno?

50:36.567 --> 50:41.107
Another word out of you,
I put a bullet in your head.

50:41.172 --> 50:43.152
<i>It's about time.</i>

50:44.775 --> 50:50.817
<i>Bruno wasn't to blame,</i>

50:50.881 --> 50:52.292
not directly anyway.

50:52.349 --> 50:55.860
Call it insecurity.

50:55.920 --> 51:01.893
Bruno, Mimi never quite felt
comfortable around your friends.

51:04.762 --> 51:08.335
They all look at me
like I was some dumb Bai girl.

51:08.399 --> 51:13.144
When Bruno wasn't around,
then they talk about my accent,

51:13.204 --> 51:18.950
the way I dress,
the way I walk, everything.

51:19.010 --> 51:22.287
<i>You thought you'd be happy
if you were as sophisticated</i>

51:22.346 --> 51:27.694
and worldly as they were.

51:27.752 --> 51:30.631
<i>So when your friend Louise
invited you to do heroin</i>

51:30.688 --> 51:34.101
<i>with her,
you couldn't say no.</i>

51:34.158 --> 51:37.662
<i>You told yourself you couldn't
get hooked the first time,</i>

51:37.728 --> 51:41.608
<i>especially if you
snorted it.</i>

51:41.665 --> 51:46.114
<i>Louise was so smart
and so happy,</i>

51:46.170 --> 51:48.150
<i>maybe you'd be too.</i>

51:53.877 --> 51:56.084
<i>But it didn't last.</i>

51:56.147 --> 52:01.096
That hole in your heart,
it remains.

52:01.151 --> 52:03.825
Stop romanticizing it.

52:03.887 --> 52:06.868
<i>You think that helps?</i>

52:06.924 --> 52:09.871
She's not an addict
because of some deep

52:09.927 --> 52:14.706
phycological
or spiritual need.

52:14.765 --> 52:17.302
She's an addict
because she used heroin.

52:17.368 --> 52:19.507
It's that simple.

52:19.570 --> 52:22.346
It's an addictive drug,
and once you start using it,

52:22.406 --> 52:24.852
you can't stop.

52:24.909 --> 52:27.947
That's why it's a
multibillion-dollar business.

52:28.012 --> 52:30.117
<i>Why did she take
it in the ?rst place?</i>

52:30.180 --> 52:33.218
Did you ever ask her?

52:33.284 --> 52:34.957
Are you blaming me?

52:35.019 --> 52:36.521
Do you blame yourself?

52:36.587 --> 52:37.861
No.

52:37.922 --> 52:40.334
That's good.

52:40.391 --> 52:44.567
Because even if Mimi
had never met you,

52:44.628 --> 52:47.165
<i>despair would have eventually
driven her to drugs.</i>

52:47.231 --> 52:50.235
<i>Her environment
was so corrupt.</i>

52:50.301 --> 52:53.282
Did you know
Ric was a twin?

52:55.306 --> 52:56.717
You mean
there's two of them?

52:56.774 --> 52:59.687
Was.

52:59.743 --> 53:04.692
<i>She died when
they were just 18.</i>

53:04.748 --> 53:06.091
<i>She?</i>

53:06.150 --> 53:10.064
He's got a chick twin?

53:10.120 --> 53:14.091
I guess his parents forgot
which one to put the dress on.

53:16.760 --> 53:23.234
And Bruno, if he has his way,
he's going to kill you.

53:38.849 --> 53:44.925
<i>Is that true, Ricky boy?</i>

53:44.989 --> 53:49.062
Are you gonna kill me?

53:49.126 --> 53:51.106
If there's any justice.

53:54.164 --> 54:00.137
Fortunately, Ric and I
define justice differently.

54:03.440 --> 54:08.082
It's not my will that
any of you die today.

54:08.145 --> 54:14.118
<i>I came to give you life,
life more abundantly.</i>

54:15.686 --> 54:18.428
Tell that to my son.

54:18.489 --> 54:23.461
Chris, does your
son still exist?

54:24.995 --> 54:29.637
Helen, does he?

54:29.700 --> 54:33.944
<i>That pan of you that hears
my voice knows deep inside</i>

54:34.004 --> 54:37.110
<i>that Timothy is in a much
better and more glorious place,</i>

54:37.174 --> 54:42.283
<i>and one day you'll be
reunited with him.</i>

54:42.346 --> 54:46.021
That's why Chris
despises you.

54:46.083 --> 54:48.689
<i>Your small
but lingering hope</i>

54:48.752 --> 54:53.792
<i>that one day you'll
see Timothy again.</i>

54:53.857 --> 54:56.201
<i>It's an affront to him.</i>

54:56.260 --> 54:58.672
<i>He resents you for it.</i>

54:58.729 --> 55:03.371
<i>In his eyes you traded
true pain and mourning</i>

55:03.434 --> 55:06.608
<i>for some self-comforting
religious fantasy.</i>

55:06.670 --> 55:12.985
In his eyes Timothy
just blinked away,

55:14.745 --> 55:20.991
<i>never to be again, no heaven,
no hell, no nothing.</i>

55:21.051 --> 55:25.898
But Chris, that's not a very
emotionally satisfying

55:25.956 --> 55:28.766
kind of atheism, is it?

55:28.826 --> 55:32.501
You can't rage against a void
because a void can't hear you.

55:32.563 --> 55:34.474
A void can't be hurt
or punished.

55:34.531 --> 55:35.805
You needed someone.

55:35.866 --> 55:41.782
<i>You needed something to
direct all that anger at.</i>

55:41.839 --> 55:43.512
You needed God.

55:43.574 --> 55:47.545
I'll direct it against you
if you don't shut up!

55:53.717 --> 55:57.859
<i>Chris, I wish
that you believed</i>

55:57.921 --> 56:02.995
half of what you once
said you believed.

56:03.060 --> 56:08.840
<i>Chris once was very publicly
proud of being a man of faith.</i>

56:08.899 --> 56:11.903
<i>He could name it and claim it
with the best of them,</i>

56:11.969 --> 56:16.918
so revered as one of the
company's moral compasses.

56:16.974 --> 56:19.454
One that-

56:19.509 --> 56:23.184
Oh, Chris had no problem

56:23.247 --> 56:27.491
marketing sub-prime
mortgage packages.

56:27.551 --> 56:30.054
You knew they were bad
from the beginning.

56:30.120 --> 56:32.498
That's nonsense!
Nonsense!

56:32.556 --> 56:35.332
<i>I had plenty of them in
my own personal portfolio.</i>

56:35.392 --> 56:38.373
<i>You sold them all
for a substantial pro?t</i>

56:38.429 --> 56:40.705
before they collapsed.

56:40.764 --> 56:45.042
<i>You used the pro?t to
help buy this hotel.</i>

56:45.102 --> 56:48.083
<i>I thought! was a crook.</i>

56:51.408 --> 56:57.484
It is easier for a camel to
pass through the eye of a needle

56:57.548 --> 57:02.520
<i>than for a rich man to enter
the kingdom of God.</i>

57:05.722 --> 57:09.295
Why don't you just
leave the guy alone?

57:09.359 --> 57:11.236
Why don't you leave
Bruno alone?

57:11.295 --> 57:12.603
<i>Yeah!</i>

57:13.263 --> 57:16.244
Why are you treating me
like the bad guy?

57:16.300 --> 57:19.804
You know how many people
his heroin kills every year?

57:19.870 --> 57:23.818
Yes, and I know
every one of their names.

57:23.874 --> 57:26.855
So you should hate him
as much as I do.

57:26.910 --> 57:29.186
<i>Burl don't.</i>

57:29.246 --> 57:32.693
Sadly, if he doesn't repent,
I will be forced

57:32.749 --> 57:35.889
by that decision of his
to judge him.

57:35.952 --> 57:40.332
But don't think that I take
pleasure in that, I don't.

57:40.391 --> 57:44.134
So what are you saying?
He can go to heaven?

57:44.194 --> 57:47.141
Yes, if he repents.

57:47.197 --> 57:50.906
<i>I'd be thrilled.</i>

57:50.968 --> 57:54.609
<i>Well, count me out then
because I ain't going anywhere</i>

57:54.671 --> 57:58.953
where he's going except maybe
to prison to visit him.

57:59.009 --> 58:05.221
<i>Ric, can I
ask you a question?</i>

58:05.282 --> 58:07.387
Can I stop you?

58:07.451 --> 58:14.027
Is all this anger
and hatred,

58:14.091 --> 58:17.072
is it going to bring
your sister Michelle back?

58:24.535 --> 58:26.515
What happened to her?

58:30.307 --> 58:33.618
<i>Overdose.</i>

58:33.677 --> 58:34.951
<i>Heroin.</i>

58:47.591 --> 58:49.696
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

59:06.443 --> 59:11.415
That's rich
coming from you.

59:11.481 --> 59:13.461
People like you
killed her.

59:21.792 --> 59:25.706
<i>So now you're
going to kill him?</i>

59:25.762 --> 59:27.742
<i>If that's what it takes.</i>

59:27.798 --> 59:32.110
- To do what?
- To bring him to justice!

59:32.169 --> 59:35.048
<i>Ric, you love
that word justice.</i>

59:35.105 --> 59:36.379
<i>You don't know
what it means.</i>

59:36.440 --> 59:39.717
<i>Justice has no place
for illegal wire-taps,</i>

59:39.776 --> 59:42.450
planted evidence,
perjured testimony.

59:42.512 --> 59:47.188
<i>Hey! I'm just trying to
level the playing field here.</i>

59:47.251 --> 59:49.527
Guys like Bruno have
all the money they need

59:49.586 --> 59:56.367
<i>to hire the best lawyers,
buy half the judges and juries.</i>

59:56.426 --> 01:00:01.500
<i>If we didn't cut some corners,
we wouldn't make case one.</i>

01:00:01.565 --> 01:00:04.808
<i>The ends don't
justify the means.</i>

01:00:04.868 --> 01:00:06.142
Says who?!

01:00:06.203 --> 01:00:08.114
You?

01:00:08.172 --> 01:00:11.415
Your way doesn't work.

01:00:11.475 --> 01:00:14.513
The meek didn't
inherit the earth.

01:00:14.578 --> 01:00:20.654
They got chewed up
and spit out.

01:00:20.717 --> 01:00:23.698
<i>Is your way working, Ric?</i>

01:00:23.754 --> 01:00:30.672
Has all your anger
gotten you any peace?

01:00:30.727 --> 01:00:33.708
<i>You haven't had one moment
of peace since the day</i>

01:00:33.764 --> 01:00:39.237
you walked in the door and found
your sister Michelle like that.

01:00:39.303 --> 01:00:41.783
<i>But it's not
too late, Ric.</i>

01:00:41.838 --> 01:00:44.375
Behold me.

01:00:44.441 --> 01:00:49.288
<i>I stand at the door of
your heart, and I knock.</i>

01:01:00.590 --> 01:01:05.562
<i>It's your supplier, again.</i>

01:01:06.730 --> 01:01:08.004
This is him.

01:01:08.064 --> 01:01:09.372
Hello?

01:01:16.173 --> 01:01:18.153
Will you still
be here today?

01:01:20.310 --> 01:01:23.291
<i>But you still will be
here today, right?</i>

01:01:26.816 --> 01:01:30.127
Late r?

01:01:30.187 --> 01:01:31.495
<i>All right.</i>

01:01:35.692 --> 01:01:37.000
<i>Not til later.</i>

01:01:41.097 --> 01:01:42.440
I don't like this,
Bruno.

01:01:42.499 --> 01:01:44.638
This whole thing's
going south fast.

01:01:44.701 --> 01:01:45.975
I mean, the storm.

01:01:46.036 --> 01:01:48.175
Come on.
Who is this guy?

01:01:48.238 --> 01:01:51.651
He knows too much.
He's dangerous.

01:01:51.708 --> 01:01:54.484
I know.
I know.

01:01:54.544 --> 01:01:59.459
He's the guy with the beard
I saw outside of Deville's.

01:01:59.516 --> 01:02:01.518
<i>He's not Jesus Christ.</i>

01:02:01.584 --> 01:02:03.723
If you know what's good
for you, you'll go over there

01:02:03.787 --> 01:02:06.927
and put a bullet in his head
right now, right now.

01:02:17.901 --> 01:02:19.209
You Okay?

01:02:25.676 --> 01:02:27.747
Mimi?
Mimi?

01:02:27.811 --> 01:02:31.588
I'm dying, Bruno.

01:02:31.648 --> 01:02:33.628
<i>Got to help me.</i>

01:02:43.994 --> 01:02:47.567
No, trust me.

01:02:47.631 --> 01:02:50.134
She can go into
cardiac arrest.

01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:52.646
Trust me.

01:03:22.466 --> 01:03:27.438
<i>Mimi, I know
what you really want.</i>

01:03:31.041 --> 01:03:36.389
This can maybe heal you
for a couple of hours,

01:03:36.446 --> 01:03:41.327
but I can heal you
for eternity.

01:03:41.384 --> 01:03:47.062
Which will it be?

01:03:47.123 --> 01:03:49.330
Eternity.

01:04:20.924 --> 01:04:25.236
How do you feel?

01:04:25.295 --> 01:04:27.275
Healed.

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:33.010
<i>Am I healed forever?</i>

01:04:33.069 --> 01:04:39.281
Your body is healed,
but not your soul.

01:04:39.342 --> 01:04:41.754
Can you heal that too?

01:04:41.811 --> 01:04:44.485
Yeah.

01:04:44.547 --> 01:04:48.324
And unlike what you learned
at that monastery,

01:04:48.384 --> 01:04:52.127
<i>I won't force you to suffer
through a thousand lifetimes</i>

01:04:52.189 --> 01:04:56.160
<i>of war and sorrow
and death.</i>

01:04:58.628 --> 01:05:02.132
The work has already
been done.

01:05:02.199 --> 01:05:04.702
Do you know howl died,
Mimi, on the cross?

01:05:04.768 --> 01:05:09.444
Have you ever
heard of that?

01:05:09.506 --> 01:05:12.487
Do you know what
I did there?

01:05:14.845 --> 01:05:18.759
I sacrificed myself
for your sins,

01:05:18.815 --> 01:05:21.762
for the sins
of the world.

01:05:21.818 --> 01:05:24.958
I took it all
upon myself.

01:05:25.021 --> 01:05:29.993
<i>I paid the penalty so
that you don't have to.</i>

01:05:33.063 --> 01:05:40.038
Mimi, today, if you
desire, you are free.

01:05:42.472 --> 01:05:45.214
What do I have to do?

01:05:45.275 --> 01:05:47.653
Believe in me.

01:05:47.711 --> 01:05:52.182
Trust me.

01:05:52.248 --> 01:05:55.354
I do.

01:05:55.418 --> 01:05:57.329
I know you do.

01:05:57.387 --> 01:06:03.235
I can see inside
your heart.

01:06:03.293 --> 01:06:05.273
Mimi...

01:06:05.328 --> 01:06:10.277
Today you are my precious,

01:06:10.333 --> 01:06:12.677
precious daughter.

01:06:40.797 --> 01:06:45.940
You see,
never give up hope.

01:07:03.453 --> 01:07:08.129
<i>Bruno, I've been healed.</i>

01:07:08.191 --> 01:07:09.727
I feel it.

01:07:09.792 --> 01:07:11.100
Oh, that's terrific.

01:07:11.161 --> 01:07:12.799
I know it's true.

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:14.899
Oh, that's great,
baby.

01:07:14.964 --> 01:07:17.410
That's great.

01:07:17.467 --> 01:07:19.242
<i>Bruno.</i>

01:07:19.302 --> 01:07:22.749
Listen-

01:07:22.805 --> 01:07:25.342
would you get me
some coffee?

01:07:25.408 --> 01:07:26.682
- Sure.
- Yeah?

01:07:26.743 --> 01:07:29.383
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:07:29.445 --> 01:07:31.322
You got a kitchen
here, right?

01:07:31.381 --> 01:07:32.655
Yeah.

01:07:32.716 --> 01:07:34.059
<i>Would you
mind just, you know</i>

01:07:34.117 --> 01:07:36.222
getting some coffee,
some sandwiches?

01:07:36.286 --> 01:07:38.892
You know, we're gonna be
here a couple hours more.

01:07:38.955 --> 01:07:43.233
Don't worry.
I'll pay you.

01:07:43.293 --> 01:07:46.638
<i>You know just treat us
like any other guests</i>

01:07:46.696 --> 01:07:49.939
who held you hostage.

01:07:54.237 --> 01:07:57.582
<i>We need to talk.</i>

01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:59.142
<i>Yeah, everything's
under control.</i>

01:07:59.209 --> 01:08:00.483
<i>Go with them, huh?</i>

01:08:00.543 --> 01:08:02.989
Make sure
she stays healed.

01:08:03.046 --> 01:08:08.046
<i>III</i>

01:08:15.892 --> 01:08:18.462
You still smiling, huh?

01:08:18.528 --> 01:08:19.836
Have a seat.

01:08:26.803 --> 01:08:31.548
You know, under normal
circumstances,

01:08:31.608 --> 01:08:38.457
any man who messes
with my wife's mind dies.

01:08:38.515 --> 01:08:43.897
<i>But since you managed
to calm her down,</i>

01:08:43.953 --> 01:08:48.328
I'm gonna give you
a pass this time.

01:08:48.390 --> 01:08:51.861
Bruno, what do you think
just happened?

01:08:51.928 --> 01:08:57.606
Was it just words?
Or did she really change?

01:08:57.667 --> 01:09:00.580
You never experienced
firsthand

01:09:00.636 --> 01:09:06.212
the destruction that
your product causes

01:09:06.276 --> 01:09:08.620
<i>until Mimi.</i>

01:09:41.711 --> 01:09:47.184
You are sorry, Bruno,
but sorry isn't enough.

01:09:58.628 --> 01:10:01.404
What do you expect
me to do?

01:10:01.464 --> 01:10:04.445
He's not gonna stop.

01:10:07.971 --> 01:10:12.442
I am ready
to forgive you.

01:10:12.509 --> 01:10:16.480
The price is true
repentance.

01:10:19.783 --> 01:10:22.389
This is my last deal.

01:10:22.452 --> 01:10:24.796
I'm getting out
of this.

01:10:24.854 --> 01:10:27.357
<i>That's good.</i>

01:10:27.424 --> 01:10:30.371
<i>You should walk away.</i>

01:10:30.427 --> 01:10:36.309
<i>But Bruno, is walking away
going to make you clean?</i>

01:10:39.302 --> 01:10:42.943
<i>Did it work for you,
Chris?</i>

01:10:43.506 --> 01:10:48.114
You're comparing me
to him now?

01:10:48.178 --> 01:10:49.680
<i>I was a respectable
businessman.</i>

01:10:49.746 --> 01:10:52.488
He's a criminal.

01:10:52.549 --> 01:10:54.551
Yet, you walked away
from your work.

01:10:54.617 --> 01:10:56.494
Why?

01:10:56.552 --> 01:10:58.429
Because I had enough.

01:10:58.488 --> 01:11:01.401
I was sick of the greed
and materialism.

01:11:01.457 --> 01:11:03.459
Whose Chris?

01:11:03.526 --> 01:11:05.028
<i>Society's or yours?</i>

01:11:05.094 --> 01:11:07.597
Does it matter?

01:11:07.664 --> 01:11:10.804
<i>I knew it was wrong
and I left.</i>

01:11:10.867 --> 01:11:12.278
<i>Who told
you it was wrong?</i>

01:11:12.335 --> 01:11:14.576
No one, I just knew.

01:11:14.637 --> 01:11:18.107
<i>No, you didn't,</i>

01:11:18.174 --> 01:11:24.284
not until you walked in front
of the wrong mirror, Chris.

01:11:24.347 --> 01:11:27.021
Timothy.

01:11:27.083 --> 01:11:29.529
What are you
talking about?

01:11:29.586 --> 01:11:33.693
You loved being the moral
compass of your company,

01:11:33.756 --> 01:11:39.502
but then Timothy gave his life
to me and everything changed.

01:11:39.562 --> 01:11:44.875
His faith was so alive,
so vibrant, so selfless

01:11:44.934 --> 01:11:47.505
<i>that you knew deep inside
you didn't really believe</i>

01:11:47.570 --> 01:11:50.107
what he believed-

01:11:50.173 --> 01:11:54.144
that your God
wasn't God at all,

01:11:57.213 --> 01:12:03.186
and that what you really
worshiped was success.

01:12:05.889 --> 01:12:09.063
If I really worshiped
success,

01:12:09.125 --> 01:12:12.436
<i>why'd I throw it all away
and come here, huh?</i>

01:12:12.495 --> 01:12:15.499
It's the ultimate show
of success,

01:12:15.565 --> 01:12:21.447
thumbing your nose at
cut-throat corporate greed

01:12:21.504 --> 01:12:25.543
<i>and coming here to sit
on a beach in paradise,</i>

01:12:25.608 --> 01:12:30.853
<i>proving once and for all
your moral superiority.</i>

01:12:30.913 --> 01:12:34.690
<i>Am I right?</i>

01:12:34.751 --> 01:12:39.791
<i>I'm not answering
any more of your questions.</i>

01:12:39.856 --> 01:12:42.097
Neither can I answer
your question.

01:12:42.158 --> 01:12:45.537
Which is?

01:12:45.595 --> 01:12:48.405
"Why did my son die?"

01:13:11.921 --> 01:13:13.332
<i>How much longer?</i>

01:13:13.389 --> 01:13:15.369
I'm almost done.

01:13:26.636 --> 01:13:28.877
Tell me something.

01:13:28.938 --> 01:13:32.818
Are we in danger?

01:13:32.875 --> 01:13:36.482
You and your husband
and Jesus are okay,

01:13:36.546 --> 01:13:40.187
but I'm worried
about the policeman.

01:13:40.249 --> 01:13:43.162
I have to trust
Jesus about him.

01:13:43.219 --> 01:13:46.098
He's not really Jesus.

01:13:46.155 --> 01:13:47.862
Yes, he is.

01:13:47.924 --> 01:13:50.564
Look at me.
I'm healed!

01:13:50.626 --> 01:13:52.765
He says you know him too
when you were 12.

01:13:52.829 --> 01:13:59.508
When I was 12...
... everything seemed possible,

01:13:59.569 --> 01:14:03.608
even a God who took an active
interest in everything you did.

01:14:03.673 --> 01:14:05.949
You don't believe
that any more?

01:14:06.008 --> 01:14:09.285
No, I don't.

01:14:09.345 --> 01:14:13.760
And even if I did, what
difference does it make?

01:14:13.816 --> 01:14:19.823
Where do you go when
the worst thing happens?

01:14:19.889 --> 01:14:22.392
I lost a son.

01:14:36.639 --> 01:14:39.779
I get it.

01:14:54.223 --> 01:14:55.600
Do you want something?

01:14:55.658 --> 01:14:56.966
<i>Thank you.</i>

01:15:02.932 --> 01:15:06.345
Can I untie him so I can
give him something to eat?

01:15:06.402 --> 01:15:09.679
<i>What do you say, Jesus?</i>

01:15:09.739 --> 01:15:13.152
Can I trust him
to behave himself?

01:15:13.209 --> 01:15:17.021
<i>You know the
answer to that question.</i>

01:15:17.079 --> 01:15:18.888
<i>You bet I do.</i>

01:15:18.948 --> 01:15:22.896
<i>If he wants something,
give it to him there.</i>

01:15:28.057 --> 01:15:31.038
<i>Is that what it's
gonna take to stop you?</i>

01:15:34.530 --> 01:15:38.774
Tell him, Jesus.

01:15:38.834 --> 01:15:42.441
<i>It was never my intention
to kill him.</i>

01:15:42.505 --> 01:15:48.478
I'd be more than happy
if you had just walked away.

01:15:48.544 --> 01:15:50.524
Live and let live, Ric.

01:15:56.953 --> 01:15:58.694
But you're going
to kill him now.

01:15:58.754 --> 01:16:00.028
<i>No!</i>

01:16:00.089 --> 01:16:02.330
<i>Don't listen to him.</i>

01:16:02.391 --> 01:16:08.103
I'm gonna let Ricky boy sit
right there, tied to that chair

01:16:08.164 --> 01:16:10.144
as we go on
our merry way.

01:16:11.834 --> 01:16:17.409
<i>Knowing full well
that Kamal will do it.</i>

01:16:17.473 --> 01:16:21.649
It's not my responsibility
what happens after we leave.

01:16:21.711 --> 01:16:26.751
Yes, Bruno, it is.

01:16:26.816 --> 01:16:28.853
What do you expect
me to do?

01:16:28.918 --> 01:16:31.091
He's not gonna stop.

01:16:31.153 --> 01:16:33.633
Give yourself up.

01:16:33.689 --> 01:16:35.930
It's not fair.

01:16:35.992 --> 01:16:38.472
<i>Is it fair that I
had to leave heavenly glory</i>

01:16:38.528 --> 01:16:42.874
<i>to bear the punishment
for your sins?</i>

01:16:42.932 --> 01:16:46.004
<i>No, it wasn't fair.</i>

01:16:46.069 --> 01:16:50.279
But Bruno, sometimes
love trumps fairness.

01:16:50.339 --> 01:16:54.310
Bruno, I've been waiting all
your life for the moment

01:16:54.377 --> 01:16:59.952
when you would finally lay down
the burden of all the sins

01:17:00.016 --> 01:17:01.996
that you've committed.

01:17:05.554 --> 01:17:09.764
<i>It weighs so heavy
on you, Bruno.</i>

01:17:09.825 --> 01:17:12.806
<i>Give that burden to me.</i>

01:17:12.862 --> 01:17:14.842
<i>I'll take it for you.</i>

01:17:18.734 --> 01:17:20.372
I can't.

01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:23.313
<i>I can't.</i>

01:17:26.041 --> 01:17:28.317
<i>I don't know why you
went through all that trouble.</i>

01:17:28.377 --> 01:17:32.348
I could have told you
what he was gonna say.

01:17:45.461 --> 01:17:48.408
Don't say it.

01:17:48.464 --> 01:17:50.967
Say what?

01:17:51.033 --> 01:17:52.671
That I should do it.

01:17:57.306 --> 01:18:03.746
If I go with him,
I could end up injail.

01:18:03.813 --> 01:18:06.794
Maybe you have to
go to jail to be free.

01:18:09.385 --> 01:18:11.831
I love you.

01:18:11.888 --> 01:18:14.869
Then do it for me,
please.

01:18:26.802 --> 01:18:29.783
<i>I told you he wasn't
gonna fall for your line.</i>

01:18:33.576 --> 01:18:34.919
It's very hard
to except the truth

01:18:34.977 --> 01:18:38.948
when you've been living
a lie all your life.

01:18:44.053 --> 01:18:50.527
<i>Sometimes it's easier
just to die.</i>

01:18:50.593 --> 01:18:52.834
Isn't that rig ht,
Chris?

01:18:52.895 --> 01:18:56.104
I never lived a lie.

01:18:56.165 --> 01:18:59.146
<i>But you
are ready to die.</i>

01:19:01.604 --> 01:19:05.643
One of the saddest
things that I see

01:19:05.708 --> 01:19:10.919
is the way couples tear each
other apart in anger and guilt

01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:15.326
instead of pulling together
when they lose a child.

01:19:15.384 --> 01:19:19.764
<i>I tried.</i>

01:19:19.822 --> 01:19:24.464
But he built this
little shrine to Tim,

01:19:24.527 --> 01:19:27.508
and he didn't let anybody
else in, not even me.

01:19:29.932 --> 01:19:34.472
Helen, your marriage wasn't
going to end in divorce.

01:19:34.537 --> 01:19:37.074
<i>If you don't like the way
we react to children's deaths,</i>

01:19:37.139 --> 01:19:39.050
stop killing them!

01:19:54.990 --> 01:19:58.199
<i>Are you going
to tell her, or am I?</i>

01:19:58.261 --> 01:20:03.261
<i>III</i>

01:20:08.404 --> 01:20:13.376
Chris was going to
take his life today.

01:20:15.578 --> 01:20:20.049
He was going to wait
for the storm to hit

01:20:22.818 --> 01:20:27.733
<i>and then walk out
into the waves</i>

01:20:27.790 --> 01:20:30.771
<i>and shoot himself.</i>

01:20:35.831 --> 01:20:37.811
<i>Is that true?</i>

01:20:41.904 --> 01:20:44.885
You were gonna
do that to me?

01:20:46.675 --> 01:20:49.849
I wasn't doing it
to you.

01:20:49.912 --> 01:20:55.157
After everything that we've
been through with Tim,

01:20:55.217 --> 01:20:59.996
you were gonna
do that to me?

01:21:00.055 --> 01:21:01.534
I wasn't.

01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:03.661
That's so selfish.

01:21:03.726 --> 01:21:05.364
Just get off me!

01:21:05.427 --> 01:21:07.634
No, come on, Helen!

01:21:07.696 --> 01:21:09.004
Please!

01:21:10.132 --> 01:21:12.112
<i>I talk to her.</i>

01:21:15.838 --> 01:21:17.613
<i>You want
me to stop her?</i>

01:21:17.673 --> 01:21:19.914
<i>No.</i>

01:21:27.083 --> 01:21:29.529
I didn't want
to hurt her.

01:21:29.585 --> 01:21:31.565
<i>I know.</i>

01:21:39.462 --> 01:21:41.442
Why did Tim have to die?

01:21:45.968 --> 01:21:48.710
He died for you.

01:22:08.457 --> 01:22:11.438
Helen, are you okay?

01:22:14.897 --> 01:22:16.205
No.

01:22:21.303 --> 01:22:24.716
Everything I had
is gone.

01:22:24.774 --> 01:22:28.244
But you have hope.

01:22:50.566 --> 01:22:54.605
Your son was
a fine young man

01:22:54.670 --> 01:22:57.776
<i>and loved me
very much.</i>

01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:04.553
His goal was to share me
with the whole world.

01:23:04.613 --> 01:23:07.890
Then why'd you
take him?

01:23:07.950 --> 01:23:12.399
<i>Chris, you keep
crediting me with his death,</i>

01:23:12.454 --> 01:23:15.264
but that's not the case.

01:23:15.324 --> 01:23:18.635
<i>I created
a perfect world,</i>

01:23:18.694 --> 01:23:25.669
<i>paradise without death
or disease, any of those things.</i>

01:23:26.702 --> 01:23:30.809
Then I created man.

01:23:30.873 --> 01:23:36.346
<i>I gave him a wondrous
but very dangerous gift:</i>

01:23:36.412 --> 01:23:39.655
free will.

01:23:39.715 --> 01:23:44.164
And soon paradise
was lost

01:23:44.219 --> 01:23:49.134
<i>and fell to murder,
war, greed,</i>

01:23:49.191 --> 01:23:53.640
<i>pride, terrible things,</i>

01:23:53.696 --> 01:23:58.543
all of which sprung
from the heart of man.

01:23:58.600 --> 01:24:02.173
<i>I didn't create
one of them.</i>

01:24:02.237 --> 01:24:04.217
But you let ‘em happen?

01:24:07.910 --> 01:24:09.218
Yes.

01:24:10.012 --> 01:24:12.822
But you're not responsible?

01:24:12.881 --> 01:24:15.919
I gave you freewill.

01:24:15.985 --> 01:24:18.192
What a cop-out!

01:24:18.253 --> 01:24:21.564
If I sawa guy raping
a girl in an alley,

01:24:21.623 --> 01:24:23.660
<i>I could never live
with myself if I didn't</i>

01:24:23.726 --> 01:24:26.104
<i>do something about it.</i>

01:24:26.161 --> 01:24:27.606
But you're just
fine with it?

01:24:27.663 --> 01:24:29.301
No.

01:24:29.365 --> 01:24:33.472
<i>I cry a billion rears
across the world every day.</i>

01:24:33.536 --> 01:24:35.777
Then why don't you
do anything about it?

01:24:35.838 --> 01:24:40.583
I did, 2,000 years ago
on a wooden cross,

01:24:40.642 --> 01:24:43.248
and I continue today
crying out into the hearts

01:24:43.312 --> 01:24:46.725
and the consciences of
every man and every woman,

01:24:46.782 --> 01:24:49.763
the same way
I'm crying out to you.

01:24:52.187 --> 01:24:55.657
<i>Light has come
into the world,</i>

01:24:55.724 --> 01:25:00.195
but the oh-so-tragic
reality

01:25:00.262 --> 01:25:04.335
<i>is that men
love the darkness.</i>

01:25:04.400 --> 01:25:07.711
<i>Ultimately, I take every bit
of it and I turn it around</i>

01:25:07.769 --> 01:25:12.149
<i>for the bene?t of my
Father's kingdom.</i>

01:25:12.207 --> 01:25:19.056
<i>How did my son's
death bene?t your kingdom?</i>

01:25:19.114 --> 01:25:22.095
By bringing you into it.

01:25:28.123 --> 01:25:34.096
<i>Chris, Timothy knew that
you didn't really believe in me.</i>

01:25:35.764 --> 01:25:39.735
<i>He became very concerned
for your soul.</i>

01:25:46.709 --> 01:25:48.689
The tsunami.

01:25:51.346 --> 01:25:57.262
When man fell in
the Garden of Eden,

01:25:57.319 --> 01:26:00.732
the whole world
fell with him.

01:26:00.789 --> 01:26:05.465
Disasters like the
tsunami are all echoes

01:26:05.527 --> 01:26:10.374
of that initial cataclysm.

01:26:10.432 --> 01:26:17.008
<i>But remember,
I never let evil win.</i>

01:26:17.072 --> 01:26:19.518
And so I'm here,

01:26:19.575 --> 01:26:24.422
answering the prayers
of a wonderful young son.

01:26:24.480 --> 01:26:30.487
<i>For his beloved father,
that one day he would come</i>

01:26:30.552 --> 01:26:33.965
<i>into a relationship
with me.</i>

01:26:34.022 --> 01:26:37.492
New life in me.

01:26:43.598 --> 01:26:48.809
<i>Bring him back, please.</i>

01:26:48.871 --> 01:26:54.287
<i>Chris, I can bring him back.</i>

01:26:54.343 --> 01:26:57.756
But if you could see
what he's seeing now,

01:26:57.813 --> 01:27:01.226
if you could feel
what he's feeling,

01:27:01.283 --> 01:27:04.389
<i>you wouldn't even dream
of calling him back</i>

01:27:04.453 --> 01:27:09.630
<i>to this fallen world,
not even for a second</i>

01:27:09.691 --> 01:27:16.006
<i>And I guarantee you,
if you put your faith in me,</i>

01:27:16.064 --> 01:27:23.004
you'll be reunited with
Timothy forever... there.

01:27:34.249 --> 01:27:35.819
I will.

01:27:42.024 --> 01:27:43.332
I will.

01:27:44.126 --> 01:27:49.126
<i>III</i>

01:27:55.504 --> 01:28:00.385
So sorry I haven't
been there for you.

01:28:00.442 --> 01:28:02.718
Can you forgive me?

01:28:02.778 --> 01:28:05.088
Only if you can
forgive me.

01:28:23.398 --> 01:28:26.072
Thank you, Lord.

01:28:26.134 --> 01:28:30.276
<i>It's nice to hear
you call me Lord again.</i>

01:28:30.339 --> 01:28:34.082
<i>Don't lose it.</i>

01:28:41.950 --> 01:28:44.931
<i>I have so much in store
for you both.</i>

01:28:48.123 --> 01:28:53.505
<i>Oh, now ain't that sweet?</i>

01:28:53.562 --> 01:28:56.702
<i>Yes, it is.</i>

01:28:56.765 --> 01:28:59.143
I worry about you.

01:28:59.201 --> 01:29:00.942
<i>Haven't you ever felt
there was something missing</i>

01:29:01.003 --> 01:29:03.108
in your life?

01:29:03.171 --> 01:29:05.117
Nothing he can offer me.

01:29:05.174 --> 01:29:06.482
<i>Amen.</i>

01:29:09.211 --> 01:29:11.953
Don't you find it odd
to find yourself

01:29:12.014 --> 01:29:14.995
<i>in agreement
with Charlie?</i>

01:29:18.053 --> 01:29:20.033
Not on that.

01:29:25.994 --> 01:29:27.268
Charlie Doles.

01:29:27.329 --> 01:29:28.637
Shut up!

01:29:29.698 --> 01:29:34.044
<i>I don't need you reading back
a list of my so-called sins.</i>

01:29:34.102 --> 01:29:37.811
Let's just stick to the first
man I killed: Dwayne Weiss.

01:29:37.873 --> 01:29:39.819
You were 15 years old.

01:29:39.875 --> 01:29:43.118
<i>Yeah, and if
you know that much,</i>

01:29:43.178 --> 01:29:45.658
<i>then you know the
last words he spoke.</i>

01:29:45.714 --> 01:29:49.958
"Please, God, don't. "

01:29:51.486 --> 01:29:54.092
He called me God.

01:29:54.156 --> 01:29:56.136
<i>He wasn't
referring to you.</i>

01:29:56.191 --> 01:29:58.865
Oh, yeah?
You sure about that?

01:29:58.927 --> 01:30:01.066
I was the only man in
that room with the power

01:30:01.129 --> 01:30:04.201
to let him live
or let him die.

01:30:04.266 --> 01:30:05.836
<i>Isn't that what being
God is all about?</i>

01:30:05.901 --> 01:30:11.613
Having the power
over life and death?

01:30:11.673 --> 01:30:17.021
Bruno used to be a great
god until he got weak

01:30:17.079 --> 01:30:19.355
and started
being merciful,

01:30:19.414 --> 01:30:22.452
letting people live
who should have died.

01:30:22.517 --> 01:30:26.431
<i>And that's why we're in
this situation we're in now</i>

01:30:26.488 --> 01:30:29.196
<i>You're in this
situation you are now</i>

01:30:29.257 --> 01:30:33.967
because I wanted to give you
another chance at salvation.

01:30:34.029 --> 01:30:35.804
<i>Don't you worry about me.</i>

01:30:35.864 --> 01:30:37.844
You worry about yourself.

01:30:41.736 --> 01:30:43.738
<i>Don't Charlie.</i>

01:30:43.805 --> 01:30:46.285
Put the gun down.

01:30:46.341 --> 01:30:47.649
<i>No.</i>

01:30:49.678 --> 01:30:53.285
I've had enough of you.

01:30:53.348 --> 01:30:56.727
<i>You give me your gun.</i>

01:30:56.785 --> 01:30:59.163
Give me your gun now.

01:31:16.471 --> 01:31:18.451
Now give me the bag.

01:31:23.979 --> 01:31:27.256
Didn't have to happen
this way, Bruno.

01:31:27.315 --> 01:31:29.522
Yes, it did.

01:31:29.584 --> 01:31:32.121
I couldn't go through
with the deal, Charlie.

01:31:32.187 --> 01:31:36.260
<i>Those days are over.</i>

01:31:36.325 --> 01:31:39.101
I'm going with him.

01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:40.503
You're crazy.

01:31:40.562 --> 01:31:42.599
You're gonna spend the rest
of your life in jail.

01:31:42.664 --> 01:31:45.474
Maybe.

01:31:45.534 --> 01:31:49.778
<i>But I don't think our Lord
would lead us astray.</i>

01:31:49.838 --> 01:31:53.081
Maybe I have to go
to jail to be free.

01:31:53.141 --> 01:31:55.121
It would be
a small price to pay.

01:31:59.414 --> 01:32:02.884
<i>Your will be done.</i>

01:32:06.254 --> 01:32:08.234
What happened
to you, man?

01:32:10.759 --> 01:32:14.639
Ric-

01:32:14.696 --> 01:32:17.370
The moment has come.

01:32:17.432 --> 01:32:19.207
For what?

01:32:19.267 --> 01:32:21.577
For you to decide if you're
going to follow my will

01:32:21.637 --> 01:32:25.608
to eternal life
or your own to destruction.

01:32:30.211 --> 01:32:33.192
I think you know
the answer.

01:32:37.485 --> 01:32:39.021
Would it affect
your answer to know

01:32:39.087 --> 01:32:43.763
that Michelle is with me?

01:32:43.825 --> 01:32:48.638
<i>Her tragic cause of death didn't
mean that she wasn't saved</i>

01:32:48.697 --> 01:32:50.335
Michelle accepted
that for herself

01:32:50.398 --> 01:32:54.278
<i>when she was
14 years old.</i>

01:32:54.336 --> 01:32:58.546
<i>Now she stands in the very
presence of Father God himself.</i>

01:32:58.606 --> 01:33:02.110
Her face glows with
joy and contentment

01:33:02.177 --> 01:33:05.181
<i>beyond comprehension.</i>

01:33:05.246 --> 01:33:07.453
I want you to
see her there.

01:33:07.516 --> 01:33:11.054
If you surrender to me
and my will,

01:33:11.119 --> 01:33:15.590
you will spend
eternity with her.

01:33:15.657 --> 01:33:18.297
Helen accepted me
as a child.

01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:23.400
Today she was joined by
Chris, Mimi, even Bruno.

01:33:23.465 --> 01:33:26.844
Michelle was killed
by a heroin overdose,

01:33:26.902 --> 01:33:30.076
<i>but I promise you
hatred kills more people</i>

01:33:30.138 --> 01:33:32.744
<i>every year than heroin.</i>

01:33:32.807 --> 01:33:35.378
<i>And it's the hardest
drug of all to kick.</i>

01:33:35.443 --> 01:33:40.415
But I'll help you do it
if you embrace my love.

01:33:54.663 --> 01:33:56.643
Never

01:34:46.514 --> 01:34:47.822
Sorry, Bruno.

01:34:55.090 --> 01:34:57.127
Are you gonna be okay?

01:34:57.192 --> 01:35:01.231
<i>No, Mimi.</i>

01:35:01.296 --> 01:35:04.277
I'm not gonna make it.

01:35:09.137 --> 01:35:12.584
<i>Baby...</i>

01:35:12.641 --> 01:35:15.451
I love you.

01:35:15.510 --> 01:35:18.252
I love you too.

01:35:18.313 --> 01:35:21.783
<i>It's gonna
be okay, Mimi.</i>

01:35:21.850 --> 01:35:26.629
I'd rather die today
and live with you forever

01:35:26.688 --> 01:35:33.196
than go on the way
we were going.

01:35:33.261 --> 01:35:35.969
<i>I'm happy-</i>

01:35:44.806 --> 01:35:46.786
Bruno...

01:35:49.043 --> 01:35:54.043
<i>III</i>

01:36:04.059 --> 01:36:06.699
<i>Don't worry, Bruno.</i>

01:36:06.761 --> 01:36:09.605
I'll take care of her.

01:38:01.075 --> 01:38:02.782
Stay down, Caperna.

01:38:02.844 --> 01:38:05.051
I'm gonna send you
to meet your sister.

01:40:21.883 --> 01:40:23.191
<i>Ric.</i>

01:40:25.653 --> 01:40:27.291
Hey.

01:40:27.355 --> 01:40:29.494
Great work, man.

01:40:29.557 --> 01:40:30.865
Thanks.

01:40:33.761 --> 01:40:39.837
You'll never believe this, but
Bruno actually kept a notebook.

01:40:39.901 --> 01:40:42.313
<i>Has everything in it.</i>

01:40:42.370 --> 01:40:47.820
<i>His suppliers, his customers,
old corrupt of?cials</i>

01:40:47.875 --> 01:40:51.220
<i>in like a dozen
different countries.</i>

01:40:51.278 --> 01:40:55.249
It's gonna keep a lot of people
busy for a very long time.

01:40:58.086 --> 01:41:00.066
Are you up to
leading the team?

01:41:02.690 --> 01:41:05.500
It sounds like fun.

01:41:26.781 --> 01:41:29.455
I'm gonna have a lot
of fun with this one.

01:41:29.517 --> 01:41:30.825
Ha, ha.

01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:36.093
<i>You had a lot
of fun with Bruno, too,</i>

01:41:36.157 --> 01:41:38.137
but he came to me.

01:41:40.461 --> 01:41:45.433
So did Helen
and Chris and Mimi.

01:41:45.500 --> 01:41:47.446
Everywhere they go,
they'll spread my love

01:41:47.502 --> 01:41:51.473
<i>and shine a cleansing light
in your darkness.</i>

01:41:56.677 --> 01:41:59.419
It's not over yet.
