WEBVTT

00:20.788 --> 00:23.557
<i>What do you do
with your secrets?</i>

00:25.025 --> 00:26.527
My secrets?

00:26.627 --> 00:28.096
And do you and Sharon

00:28.196 --> 00:31.399
tell each other everything,
or do you keep secrets?

00:31.499 --> 00:32.933
I mean, even from
each other.

00:33.033 --> 00:37.138
Well, it's happened more often
than we'd like it to,

00:37.238 --> 00:39.773
but, um, we work through it.

00:39.873 --> 00:42.143
No, no, no, I don't, I don't
mean the little ones.

00:42.243 --> 00:46.280
I mean, like, big secrets.

00:46.380 --> 00:50.518
Ugly ones that are hard
to admit, even to yourself.

00:50.618 --> 00:54.021
What-what do you do
with those?

00:56.624 --> 00:59.693
What are we talking
about here, Jake?

01:02.029 --> 01:03.231
Nothing. Nothing.

01:03.331 --> 01:04.965
Um, it's all good, Chief.

01:05.065 --> 01:08.869
You know you can
always talk to me, right?

01:08.969 --> 01:12.072
I know. Thanks.

01:12.173 --> 01:15.876
Come on, Manny, rise and shine
before Vince gets back.

01:15.976 --> 01:18.078
Sharon, what gives?

01:18.179 --> 01:19.547
Come on.

01:19.647 --> 01:21.215
Come on,
I was up till 2:00 a.m.

01:21.315 --> 01:22.850
at that landfill fire
last night.

01:22.950 --> 01:24.885
Yeah, but Erika's
coming back.

01:24.985 --> 01:26.887
Erika?
Yeah.

01:26.987 --> 01:29.357
Come on. Assistant Chief
Erika Snow on the hunt

01:29.457 --> 01:30.758
for a serial arsonist.

01:30.858 --> 01:32.293
She's gonna see
that evidence against Jake

01:32.393 --> 01:33.694
and then pursue him
as a suspect

01:33.794 --> 01:35.996
while there's a real
arsonist out there.

01:36.096 --> 01:37.865
We have to be prepared.
We have to protect him.

01:39.867 --> 01:41.769
I knew it.

01:41.869 --> 01:43.704
I knew you were
hiding something.

01:43.804 --> 01:47.408
I didn't imagine
it'd be this bad.

01:48.542 --> 01:49.910
But it might explain
the very weird

01:50.010 --> 01:52.380
and cryptic breakfast
I just had with Jake.

01:52.480 --> 01:53.847
Chief, for the record,

01:53.947 --> 01:56.049
I begged her
to tell you about it.

01:56.850 --> 01:59.520
He was being cryptic?
There's evidence against him?

01:59.620 --> 02:02.290
Circumstantial evidence only.
Mm-hmm.

02:02.390 --> 02:04.458
I mean, he's the only one at 42
who doesn't have an alibi.

02:04.558 --> 02:06.560
And there's proof that
he was in Drake County

02:06.660 --> 02:07.561
when the fire started.

02:07.661 --> 02:09.363
And I need to not

02:09.463 --> 02:11.899
be part of this.

02:11.999 --> 02:14.235
I mean, I am trying
to get my life straight.

02:14.335 --> 02:15.436
I can't do it.

02:15.536 --> 02:16.804
We shouldn't be in this either.

02:16.904 --> 02:19.907
Don't make me state
the obvious.

02:20.007 --> 02:22.943
What? Come on. He was a kid.
That was a long time ago.

02:23.043 --> 02:26.747
A kid who started a fire
that you and I...

02:26.847 --> 02:28.282
you and I covered up.

02:28.382 --> 02:29.883
No, we didn't.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.852
We made an assessment
and decided he wasn't a threat.

02:31.952 --> 02:33.921
Well, what if we were wrong?
What if we didn't just

02:34.021 --> 02:36.857
cover up a mistake, we covered
up an arsonist's first time?

02:36.957 --> 02:39.827
No, no, come on, stop.
This is Jake.

02:39.927 --> 02:43.431
This is...
our Jake.

02:43.531 --> 02:46.767
He's a... he's a hero.

02:49.002 --> 02:51.605
Isn't that the
exact profile?

02:55.376 --> 02:57.645
I've been trying, you know.

02:57.745 --> 02:59.179
I've tried to call Jake
pretty much every day

02:59.280 --> 03:01.282
since the kidney donation
thing went sideways.

03:01.382 --> 03:03.551
It's like he's just--
It's like he's dodging me.

03:03.651 --> 03:05.586
I mean, you two are
still good, right?

03:05.686 --> 03:08.256
Yeah, I think so.

03:08.356 --> 03:09.923
It's why I volunteered
to come work here today,

03:10.023 --> 03:11.659
so I could try
and talk to him.

03:11.759 --> 03:14.528
And here I thought
you were trying to hang with me.

03:14.628 --> 03:17.231
Always. Hey, hey.
Come on. Always.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.569
It's not like him
to be late, huh?

03:21.669 --> 03:23.837
Well, not to work,
but he's been flaky.

03:23.937 --> 03:25.806
I mean, who passes up bowling
and beers with your girl?

03:25.906 --> 03:28.609
He did that?
Nobody.
The answer is nobody.

03:28.709 --> 03:30.844
Nobody.
Right.

03:35.516 --> 03:37.618
I-I got it.
I got it.

03:37.718 --> 03:40.187
I know you do.

03:40.288 --> 03:43.391
I need to throw a
ladder unassisted.

03:43.491 --> 03:44.992
It's one of the skills
I have to master

03:45.092 --> 03:47.861
to graduate from
being a probie.

03:47.961 --> 03:49.530
Look.

03:50.698 --> 03:52.300
Look at all these
blank boxes.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.835
But look at
all the completed ones.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.871
Your dad said
I should have patience,

03:57.971 --> 04:00.541
that it usually takes
probies two years

04:00.641 --> 04:03.043
to check off all the boxes.

04:03.143 --> 04:06.680
I told him that patience wasn't
what got me into the Olympics.

04:06.780 --> 04:09.550
It was practicing until
my lungs got bruised.

04:09.650 --> 04:11.352
I bet he liked that. Yeah.

04:11.452 --> 04:15.589
He did say he was gonna give me
more opportunities in the field.

04:15.689 --> 04:17.791
Jake. Hey. Hey, man, what's up?

04:19.126 --> 04:21.729
Same old same old.

04:25.333 --> 04:28.168
How's your morning going?

04:30.237 --> 04:31.805
Fine.

04:33.574 --> 04:35.643
Still processing

04:35.743 --> 04:39.680
the whole failed
kidney transplant.

04:39.780 --> 04:43.417
Did you know that
only one in 20,000 people

04:43.517 --> 04:47.220
actually have that level
of anesthesia intolerance?

04:47.321 --> 04:50.090
Did you know that
only one in a billion would be

04:50.190 --> 04:52.993
ashamed about it rather than
proud of their bravery?

04:53.093 --> 04:55.696
That's right.
How you coping?

04:56.497 --> 04:57.631
I'm coping fine.

04:57.731 --> 05:01.101
And where'd you go after
to recover?

05:01.201 --> 05:02.703
Home.

05:04.838 --> 05:06.507
I know you were in Drake County.

05:06.607 --> 05:10.478
Yeah, evacuating the prison
with the crew. No.

05:10.578 --> 05:11.912
I know you went there
the week before.

05:12.012 --> 05:13.381
And before you answer,
you have to know that

05:13.481 --> 05:15.549
we love you and we have
your back no matter what,

05:15.649 --> 05:18.318
but I need you
to tell me the truth now.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.688
Uh, Assistant Chief Snow
is here.

05:20.788 --> 05:22.356
She said she has an
important announcement to make.

05:30.764 --> 05:33.367
All right, Three Rock, line up.

05:36.637 --> 05:38.406
Good morning.

05:38.506 --> 05:41.809
The department is on the hunt
for a serial arsonist,

05:41.909 --> 05:45.178
and we've narrowed the search
down to this station.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.449
You think one of us
is a firebug?

05:48.549 --> 05:49.950
Yeah, but don't take
that personally.

05:50.050 --> 05:52.319
No, take this personally.

05:53.120 --> 05:55.188
The Wallace Development fire,
the Hill fire,

05:55.288 --> 05:58.258
the Drake County fire
were all intentionally set.

05:58.358 --> 06:03.363
One person is making fools
of the rest of you.

06:03.464 --> 06:06.834
So get angry, stay alert.
Help smoke them out.

06:06.934 --> 06:08.769
What should we look for?

06:08.869 --> 06:11.004
Anything out of character
is a red flag.

06:11.104 --> 06:13.641
Whoever you are,
it's not a question

06:13.741 --> 06:15.909
of if we catch you but when.

06:36.797 --> 06:40.501
Wait, is-is that why you were
asking me about Drake County?

06:42.235 --> 06:43.604
You suspect me?

06:43.704 --> 06:46.139
No, I do not,
but your Bell pass shows

06:46.239 --> 06:48.408
that you were in Drake County
the day the fire started.

06:48.509 --> 06:49.843
Yeah, well, it wasn't me.

06:53.781 --> 06:55.282
Oh, really?

06:55.382 --> 06:57.718
Don't nobody want to step up
and chime in to have my back?

07:00.087 --> 07:01.088
Chief, you know me.

07:01.188 --> 07:02.389
We do. We absolutely do.

07:02.490 --> 07:03.657
Tell me why
you were in Drake County

07:03.757 --> 07:05.158
and this whole thing goes away.

07:05.258 --> 07:07.595
I can't believe
I have to explain myself

07:07.695 --> 07:09.863
in order for you to believe me.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.142
Do I have to say it?

07:22.242 --> 07:23.577
I'm not the arsonist.

07:23.677 --> 07:25.846
Sounds like something
an arsonist would say.

07:29.216 --> 07:30.718
All right, Lee,
you got something

07:30.818 --> 07:32.553
you want to say to me?
Get it off your chest.

07:32.653 --> 07:33.821
Are you responsible for...

07:33.921 --> 07:36.690
Hey.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

07:42.229 --> 07:44.364
Why? Why, Bode?

07:44.464 --> 07:47.200
How come I'm guilty
until proven innocent?

07:47.300 --> 07:48.435
You know me, man.

07:48.536 --> 07:50.137
I would never do
anything like that.

07:50.237 --> 07:51.905
I know.

07:52.906 --> 07:54.041
You believe me?

07:54.141 --> 07:55.609
I believe you.

07:56.409 --> 07:58.278
We got two simultaneous calls.

07:58.378 --> 08:00.881
Jake, you take 1591
to the medical.

08:00.981 --> 08:02.282
I'll cover the fire.

08:02.382 --> 08:04.117
Wait, you're putting me on
the lower priority call?

08:04.217 --> 08:06.887
Every call is a priority.

08:07.655 --> 08:10.223
Chief, you're benching me
for something I didn't do.

08:10.323 --> 08:11.525
I'm not benching anybody.

08:11.625 --> 08:12.993
I'm sending you out
to do your job.

08:22.135 --> 08:23.470
Was Jake a perfect boyfriend?

08:23.571 --> 08:26.006
No, but he never lied to me.

08:26.106 --> 08:27.541
That I know of.

08:27.641 --> 08:29.543
He lied to me for years
about Riley.

08:31.111 --> 08:33.480
Did I just date
a serial arsonist?
No. Stop.

08:33.581 --> 08:36.283
We're firefighters,
not investigators. Let's go.

08:36.383 --> 08:38.285
Greencrest, we have
a two-story commercial lodge

08:38.385 --> 08:40.387
with a working fire
on the first floor,

08:40.487 --> 08:42.389
possible extension
to the second.

08:42.489 --> 08:43.657
Setting up for interior attack.

08:43.757 --> 08:45.793
I'll be assuming IC.
You the owner?

08:45.893 --> 08:47.661
Yeah.

08:47.761 --> 08:49.496
Anybody left inside?
Any guests. No.

08:49.597 --> 08:51.098
Thankfully, lodge is
vacant right now.

08:51.198 --> 08:53.033
How'd this fire get so big
without the alarm going off?

08:53.133 --> 08:54.668
I'm so sorry.

08:54.768 --> 08:56.236
My late husband-- he handled
alarms and stuff like that.

08:56.336 --> 08:58.706
So you were the only one inside?

08:58.806 --> 09:00.507
No, and my... and my two kids
are behind me.

09:00.608 --> 09:02.375
Mom, Danny's still up there!
He wouldn't come out!

09:02.475 --> 09:03.877
I tried, but there was
fire in the stairwell,

09:03.977 --> 09:05.445
and I'm sorry I left him.
Babe, it's okay.

09:05.545 --> 09:06.780
Firefighters are gonna
get him out, okay?

09:06.880 --> 09:08.381
Perez, throw a ladder
up that window.

09:08.481 --> 09:10.584
Get the kid out.
On it, Chief.

09:10.684 --> 09:12.753
Eve, you're on Attack,
division 1.

09:12.853 --> 09:14.655
Fire's on the alpha side,
living room.

09:14.755 --> 09:16.590
Got you. Probie?
Hey.

09:16.690 --> 09:19.159
Thought you were off shift.
I was close.

09:19.259 --> 09:20.928
Thought you could use the help.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.563
Yeah, all right,
suit up.

09:23.664 --> 09:25.132
Eve, take the nugget.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.566
Come on.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.572
You suspect Crawford.

09:34.041 --> 09:36.443
Sharon, you had a
public conversation.

09:36.543 --> 09:38.378
People talk.

09:38.478 --> 09:41.514
Yeah, but are you here
for suspicions or facts?

09:43.283 --> 09:46.153
I am not doing this twice.

09:46.253 --> 09:48.822
I will not bend
the rules again.

09:48.922 --> 09:52.025
This investigation
is by the book, no exceptions.

09:52.125 --> 09:53.426
Good.

09:53.526 --> 09:55.996
I will honor any truth
that you find here,

09:56.096 --> 09:57.765
even if it breaks my heart.

09:57.865 --> 10:00.801
Does that mean you're gonna
honor the deal we made?

10:02.369 --> 10:04.672
Here it is--
the list of personnel

10:04.772 --> 10:07.174
who were not on shift
in the timeline you gave me.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.542
And I'll email that over,
as well.

10:11.011 --> 10:13.613
I don't see Jake Crawford's
whereabouts on here.

10:13.714 --> 10:16.717
Because he wasn't on shift,
so that's all I know.

10:16.817 --> 10:18.385
Because like you said,

10:18.485 --> 10:21.088
I don't tuck my people
into bed at night.

10:29.262 --> 10:30.964
How are you doing?

10:31.064 --> 10:35.335
Well, you saw
what went down today.

10:36.369 --> 10:40.774
Oh, and, uh, on top of that,
I just came back from a call

10:40.874 --> 10:43.143
where the owner of a pet boa
argued with me

10:43.243 --> 10:45.612
because I wouldn't perform CPR
on his dead snake.

10:45.713 --> 10:48.982
So, how you think
I'm doing?

10:52.285 --> 10:54.154
My parents suspecting you.

10:54.254 --> 10:57.390
What, all-all this because
you were in Drake County

10:57.490 --> 10:59.126
when that fire was started?

10:59.226 --> 11:01.094
Yeah, well,
it doesn't help that I lied.

11:01.194 --> 11:04.531
Why-why would you lie
about that?

11:07.434 --> 11:08.736
I can't tell you, Bode.

11:08.836 --> 11:10.804
I wish I could,
but I can't.

11:10.904 --> 11:14.407
Okay, fine, man,
you don't have to tell me.

11:14.507 --> 11:16.309
But that's it?

11:16.409 --> 11:17.577
That's all they have?

11:17.677 --> 11:19.112
Nothing else?

11:19.212 --> 11:20.781
Yeah.

11:21.581 --> 11:24.151
That's... that's bull, man.

11:24.251 --> 11:26.119
Bode Leone?

11:27.120 --> 11:28.621
Can we talk?

11:30.023 --> 11:31.658
Yeah.

11:53.246 --> 11:54.614
Hold up.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.116
Let me give you
a hand here.

11:56.216 --> 11:58.018
Uh...
I got this.

12:05.292 --> 12:07.227
You don't know Jake.

12:07.327 --> 12:09.763
He's the good one, all right?
I-I'm the bad seed.

12:09.863 --> 12:13.733
You believe people
are good or bad, no in between?

12:14.534 --> 12:19.106
I believe that Jake would never
intentionally set a fire.

12:19.206 --> 12:20.774
No way.

12:22.375 --> 12:24.778
Remember the fire that
almost burned down his house

12:24.878 --> 12:26.179
when you were kids?

12:27.380 --> 12:28.715
Mm-hmm.

12:28.816 --> 12:30.984
Yeah, it was sixth grade.

12:31.084 --> 12:34.888
The Crawfords were new to town,
and that's how our families met.

12:35.688 --> 12:38.158
Jake's admitted
he started that fire.

12:42.729 --> 12:44.965
We're clear!

12:45.065 --> 12:47.500
Move in!

12:47.600 --> 12:49.536
Let's knock
these flames out, Collin!

12:51.071 --> 12:52.605
Next one.

12:55.876 --> 12:57.978
Can you imagine what Jake's
going through right now?

12:58.078 --> 12:59.046
Not now, probie.

12:59.146 --> 13:00.713
Let's just focus
on the work, man.

13:03.483 --> 13:06.019
I thought I knew Jake.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.655
I-I was... I was sure
that he couldn't have done this.

13:10.023 --> 13:12.792
But the secrets
that he's hid from me.

13:13.593 --> 13:15.562
Look...

13:15.662 --> 13:17.898
I know what you know.

13:19.132 --> 13:21.734
About Jake starting that fire
when he was a kid.

13:23.336 --> 13:25.205
Your mom told me.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.274
And I wish she hadn't.

13:27.374 --> 13:30.643
And I wish I wasn't caught up
in all this mess, but she did,

13:30.743 --> 13:32.212
so here we are.

13:33.013 --> 13:34.614
If he hid something
that big from me,

13:34.714 --> 13:36.083
what else could he hide?

13:37.484 --> 13:39.786
You can't know for sure.

13:39.887 --> 13:43.356
But you either trust someone
or you don't.

13:43.456 --> 13:45.692
You know?

13:48.628 --> 13:50.597
Fire department!

13:56.069 --> 13:57.837
Danny?!

13:58.771 --> 14:01.608
Danny! My name is Gabriela.

14:02.575 --> 14:04.744
I'm a firefighter.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.980
It's not safe in here.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.182
I need you to climb
through this window

14:09.282 --> 14:12.652
and climb down the ladder
while I'm spotting you, okay?

14:12.752 --> 14:16.223
Hey, Danny,
you can play this outside.

14:16.323 --> 14:17.958
Okay? But we got to go now.

14:20.793 --> 14:22.362
Come on. Come on.

14:27.800 --> 14:30.003
Go! Come on!
Get down!

14:30.103 --> 14:31.771
Come on, come on! Down, down,
down, down, down! Get down!

14:33.506 --> 14:35.442
Chief, flames hit some ammo!

14:35.542 --> 14:37.945
And it must be
a box of bullets or something.

14:38.045 --> 14:39.846
Copy that, Eve.
Get out of there.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.050
Live ammo inside.
Everybody, out now.

14:43.150 --> 14:44.851
Means you, too, Perez.

14:44.952 --> 14:46.553
Chief, I almost
have the patient!

14:50.790 --> 14:54.294
Danny, Danny, I know that the
gunshots can be startling, okay?

14:54.394 --> 14:57.364
It's okay to be scared,
but we got to go. Come on.

14:57.464 --> 14:59.699
Danny, your house
is on fire.

15:00.500 --> 15:04.004
Chief, patient's not engaging
or cooperating.

15:04.104 --> 15:05.805
Ladder's not
a viable exit route.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.874
Neither is the stairwell inside.

15:07.975 --> 15:09.342
Describe conditions in the room.

15:09.442 --> 15:11.444
Sealed off and protected.
All right.

15:11.544 --> 15:14.881
I got an SCBA en route. Put it
on the kid and come down now.

15:14.982 --> 15:17.750
Eve, what's your status?

15:17.850 --> 15:19.987
On our way out, Chief.

15:21.955 --> 15:24.324
Perez!

15:27.527 --> 15:28.828
Thank you.

15:28.928 --> 15:32.132
All right, Danny,
I'm gonna put this on you, okay?

15:32.232 --> 15:35.802
But I can't get you down that
ladder if you won't help me.

15:38.805 --> 15:41.141
Breathe. Breathe.

15:43.977 --> 15:45.612
Move, move, move, move!

15:51.184 --> 15:53.520
Hey, those windows
could blow!

15:53.620 --> 15:56.256
Move away! Move away!
Move away now!

16:08.801 --> 16:10.137
Pull that line over
to the window,

16:10.237 --> 16:11.404
start knocking down
the fire from there.

16:11.504 --> 16:13.206
Got you, Chief.

16:13.306 --> 16:14.907
Ma'am.

16:15.708 --> 16:17.677
Is there any more
ammo inside?

16:17.777 --> 16:20.547
Um... yes.
It's a hunting lodge.

16:20.647 --> 16:22.849
How much?
Uh, a lot.

16:22.949 --> 16:25.252
I'm expecting
a bachelor party this weekend.

16:25.352 --> 16:28.421
Enough for 20 guys
for three days.

16:28.521 --> 16:29.756
Where is it located?

16:29.856 --> 16:31.291
I don't know why
we didn't get rid

16:31.391 --> 16:32.659
of everything
when Dad died.

16:32.759 --> 16:34.561
Okay, it was an accident,
okay, honey?

16:35.695 --> 16:38.831
All over the house.
Please get my son out. Please.

16:38.931 --> 16:40.067
Yeah.

16:40.167 --> 16:42.001
Chief?
Yeah, I know.

16:42.102 --> 16:44.071
You're anxious
to get that kid out, okay?

16:44.171 --> 16:45.472
But nobody's
going back inside

16:45.572 --> 16:47.607
till we locate all the ammo,
till I say so.

16:47.707 --> 16:48.908
All right?
Did you see him?

16:49.008 --> 16:51.144
Is he okay?
Danny's safe for now.

16:51.244 --> 16:52.479
There's no fire in his room,

16:52.579 --> 16:53.980
and we left him with
a breathing device.

16:54.081 --> 16:55.248
We still need

16:55.348 --> 16:57.584
to get him out sooner
than later.

16:57.684 --> 17:00.287
Has your son been
diagnosed with PTSD

17:00.387 --> 17:03.156
or anything like that?

17:03.256 --> 17:04.857
No. Why?

17:04.957 --> 17:08.261
He just had a very strong
reaction to the gunshots,

17:08.361 --> 17:11.731
and he wouldn't move to
safety when there's a fire.

17:12.532 --> 17:14.501
Danny witnessed
a hunting accident

17:14.601 --> 17:16.203
that killed his... his dad.

17:16.303 --> 17:19.372
The gunshots must've
brought it back.

17:21.108 --> 17:23.310
I don't think he's climbing
down that ladder.

17:23.410 --> 17:24.677
He must be terrified.

17:24.777 --> 17:25.912
But you're gonna
get him out, right?

17:26.012 --> 17:27.514
We'll get him out
from the inside

17:27.614 --> 17:29.649
as soon as we get
control of the fire.

17:29.749 --> 17:31.118
Yeah. Oh.

17:31.218 --> 17:33.086
Did the glass hit you?

17:34.387 --> 17:35.788
Mom.

17:35.888 --> 17:39.392
You're bleeding?
What? No, no.

17:39.492 --> 17:41.894
No, it doesn't hurt.
No, it doesn't hurt.

17:41.994 --> 17:45.332
Okay, well, we should get it
dressed before it gets infected.

17:45.432 --> 17:47.500
This way. Come here.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.068
Yo, Chief.

17:49.169 --> 17:51.070
There are spot fires
behind the structure,

17:51.171 --> 17:53.773
about an acre, acre and a half
from hitting the tree line.

17:53.873 --> 17:56.709
Greencrest, we now have
a vegetation fire

17:56.809 --> 17:58.445
in addition
to the structure fire.

17:58.545 --> 18:02.182
I need Engine 1591
and Three Rock.

18:02.282 --> 18:04.751
Tell 1591 to bring Kevlar.

18:08.621 --> 18:10.290
Sorry this took a minute.

18:10.390 --> 18:11.724
The drip coffee here
is terrible,

18:11.824 --> 18:13.393
but I have a French press
in my office.

18:13.493 --> 18:16.663
All this stalling is ridiculous
and useless. Forensics called.

18:16.763 --> 18:18.565
With actual evidence?

18:18.665 --> 18:21.501
An almost literal smoking gun.

18:21.601 --> 18:22.902
Part of the drip torch

18:23.002 --> 18:25.272
we think the arsonist used
to start the fire.

18:25.372 --> 18:27.274
They were able
to lift a print off it.

18:27.374 --> 18:29.909
Hold on. You think the
arsonist is a firefighter

18:30.009 --> 18:31.944
who handled a torch
without gloves?

18:32.044 --> 18:34.681
Well, this arsonist
replaces the fuel

18:34.781 --> 18:36.716
with their own
extremely flammable accelerant

18:36.816 --> 18:38.518
by disassembling the torch.

18:38.618 --> 18:41.087
It's much easier to do
without gloves.

18:41.188 --> 18:46.493
And why are you so sure that
this torch came from Station 42?

18:47.460 --> 18:49.196
This is the serial number.

18:49.296 --> 18:50.763
It's one of a batch of eight

18:50.863 --> 18:53.065
issued to this station
18 months ago.

18:54.334 --> 18:55.835
Now, if I were you,

18:55.935 --> 18:58.004
I'd want to find out who was
in charge of engine checkouts

18:58.104 --> 19:01.574
when that torch went missing
without anyone noticing.

19:03.009 --> 19:04.611
Yeah.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.521
You got your vest on.
That's good.

19:14.621 --> 19:16.289
Might need you inside.

19:16.389 --> 19:18.591
Right now, you're
on the pump.

19:18.691 --> 19:20.993
Don't do anything
unless I tell you to.

19:21.093 --> 19:23.996
I never do anything
unless you tell me to.

19:25.232 --> 19:26.132
Hey, Jake.

19:26.233 --> 19:27.534
Hey.

19:27.634 --> 19:29.168
How am I supposed
to have your back

19:29.269 --> 19:30.537
if you hide stuff from me?

19:30.637 --> 19:32.939
What the hell
are you talking about now?

19:33.039 --> 19:36.209
About this fire
that you started as a kid.

19:37.410 --> 19:39.512
Chief Snow told me.

19:41.914 --> 19:43.883
My parents know,
don't they?

19:43.983 --> 19:46.253
Yeah, yeah, but...
And you didn't think
this was worth

19:46.353 --> 19:48.087
bringing up when I...
when I asked you point-blank

19:48.187 --> 19:50.223
if there was anything else
they had on you?

19:50.323 --> 19:52.925
You suspect me, too, huh?

19:54.126 --> 19:57.230
Because of a
mistake I made...

19:57.330 --> 19:58.531
as a kid?

19:58.631 --> 20:01.501
I don't want to...
Then don't, Bode.

20:02.969 --> 20:07.607
Man, I got everyone here
looking at me like I did it.

20:08.575 --> 20:11.043
I didn't start those fires.

20:12.612 --> 20:14.381
Okay.

20:14.481 --> 20:17.083
But if you didn't, then...

20:17.183 --> 20:19.085
what is happening?
I don't know, man.

20:19.185 --> 20:22.255
How did Chief Snow even
find out about my past, huh?

20:23.590 --> 20:25.191
Who else knew?

20:26.359 --> 20:29.462
Bode, that's not exactly
something that I advertise.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.130
I mean, some of my...

20:31.230 --> 20:32.565
Let's grab some gear
from the back.

20:32.665 --> 20:34.166
We'll meet you back here,
all right?

20:36.503 --> 20:37.937
O'Reilly?

20:38.037 --> 20:39.572
Yeah, what's up?
Did you tell
the fire investigator

20:39.672 --> 20:41.774
that I started
that fire as a kid?

20:41.874 --> 20:44.844
Did you?
Y-Yeah. Why?

20:45.645 --> 20:47.179
You don't do that.

20:47.280 --> 20:48.415
I'm sorry.
No, no.

20:48.515 --> 20:50.182
We were bonding
over our dads.

20:50.283 --> 20:52.719
That's something
that I told you in confidence.

20:52.819 --> 20:54.721
We did bond, dude.
I'm sorry, okay?

20:54.821 --> 20:56.222
I just figured
you would've told her yourself.

20:56.323 --> 20:59.058
Yeah.
We got... we got
to be transparent here.

20:59.158 --> 21:01.961
Okay? We got to clear our names
so that we can find the guy.

21:02.061 --> 21:05.965
I gave Snow my phone.
I told her to dig all she wants.

21:06.899 --> 21:09.235
My dad always played cards up
during an investigation,

21:09.336 --> 21:12.639
and I-I just kind of figured
you would do the same.

21:13.873 --> 21:16.876
Jake! I was trying to help!

21:16.976 --> 21:18.378
Jake!

21:18.478 --> 21:20.246
O'Reilly.

21:20.347 --> 21:22.382
I know you don't know me,
man, but I promise

21:22.482 --> 21:24.183
I was just trying to help.

21:24.283 --> 21:28.588
No, I-I... I just... I want
to say that I-I get it.

21:29.389 --> 21:30.990
You know, I...

21:31.090 --> 21:33.726
I remember the firebug they
caught in Hesby 15 years ago.

21:33.826 --> 21:35.895
I'm sure that your dad

21:35.995 --> 21:38.931
was just as pissed
as my parents were. Mm.

21:39.031 --> 21:41.233
It was all he talked about
for weeks.

21:43.370 --> 21:45.605
You did the right thing.

21:45.705 --> 21:47.474
Thank you.

21:47.574 --> 21:49.175
Yeah.

21:50.843 --> 21:52.845
Seriously.

21:55.014 --> 21:58.518
Now isn't the time
to go down memory lane, Bode.

21:58.618 --> 22:00.653
I wasn't, Cap.

22:03.490 --> 22:05.157
Only a few minutes

22:05.257 --> 22:07.093
from having a clear path
to the stairwell.

22:07.193 --> 22:09.161
Sounds like we're getting
to Danny real soon.

22:11.998 --> 22:14.200
I don't know. Maybe
I should've sent him to therapy.

22:14.300 --> 22:16.669
I just... I thought
it would make things worse.

22:16.769 --> 22:18.371
It's not your fault.

22:18.471 --> 22:19.739
It was nobody's fault.

22:19.839 --> 22:21.307
See? This is why
we shouldn't talk about it.

22:21.408 --> 22:22.642
I don't mean to pry,

22:22.742 --> 22:25.412
but maybe you need
to talk about it,

22:25.512 --> 22:26.879
even if it's painful.

22:26.979 --> 22:29.215
I tried at first, but it seemed
to just make him hurt.

22:29.315 --> 22:32.184
Hmm.
And then he wouldn't
come out of his room.

22:33.420 --> 22:35.087
Sometimes you got to keep
asking questions.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.957
When do you take no
for an answer?

22:38.057 --> 22:41.127
After a month? Six months?

22:41.227 --> 22:42.729
A year?

22:42.829 --> 22:44.797
Hold on. How long
has Danny been in there?

22:46.399 --> 22:49.902
All right, my boys,
you make sure that fire

22:50.002 --> 22:51.504
doesn't get to the tree lines.
You got that?

22:51.604 --> 22:52.605
Copy that.

22:52.705 --> 22:53.873
Hey, Cap.
What's up?

22:53.973 --> 22:56.208
You get cell service out here?
Why?

22:56.308 --> 22:58.511
Look up Collin O'Reilly.

22:58.611 --> 22:59.646
Ah, come on, Bode.

22:59.746 --> 23:00.947
We're working, man.

23:01.047 --> 23:02.449
Captain, Jake's rep
is on the line.

23:02.549 --> 23:04.016
Maybe his career. I know...

23:04.116 --> 23:05.685
I know you don't want
to be in on this, but you are.

23:05.785 --> 23:07.687
Look, man, there can
literally be thousands

23:07.787 --> 23:09.121
of Collin O'Reillys.

23:09.221 --> 23:10.923
Yeah, but there's only
one Kirk O'Reilly

23:11.023 --> 23:13.292
that's a Cal Fire legend.

23:13.392 --> 23:16.128
Can't be that hard
to look up his kid.

23:18.498 --> 23:20.032
Fine.

23:22.602 --> 23:24.236
Hey, Bode.

23:24.336 --> 23:26.172
This spot.

23:30.042 --> 23:31.911
Soon as it's safe,
I'm gonna send you two in,

23:32.011 --> 23:34.246
but stay clear
of this area right here.

23:34.346 --> 23:35.748
That's where most
of the ammo is stored.

23:35.848 --> 23:37.650
Chief,

23:37.750 --> 23:39.218
Danny's PTSD is worse
than we thought.

23:39.318 --> 23:41.688
He hasn't been out of
that room in three years.

23:41.788 --> 23:43.122
What?

23:43.222 --> 23:44.724
How is that even possible?

23:44.824 --> 23:46.759
And why didn't the family
tell us that?

23:46.859 --> 23:48.260
Talking's not their thing.

23:48.360 --> 23:50.296
Oh, it took a fire
for them to open up?

23:50.396 --> 23:52.999
Apparently. Kid's had zero help
dealing with his trauma.

23:53.800 --> 23:56.936
Huh. Locking himself up in that
room is him begging for help.

23:57.036 --> 23:59.071
All right, Lee, Norris,

23:59.171 --> 24:01.273
be prepared to bring
this kid out any way you can,

24:01.373 --> 24:02.575
on or off his feet.

24:02.675 --> 24:04.176
Yes, sir.
Oh, hey, Chief?

24:04.276 --> 24:07.446
You know an uncooperative
patient is a liability.

24:07.547 --> 24:10.182
Okay. You got a pitch?

24:10.983 --> 24:13.986
I understand
what Danny's going through.

24:14.086 --> 24:16.388
I feel like I understand
how to get him to come out.

24:16.489 --> 24:17.724
Send me.

24:17.824 --> 24:19.759
I've been inside before.

24:19.859 --> 24:20.860
I know the layout.
I can guide him.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.895
All right. Do it. Go.

24:25.798 --> 24:27.967
Hey, according to the Internet,

24:28.067 --> 24:29.769
Kirk O'Reilly
didn't have any children.

24:29.869 --> 24:32.271
I knew it.

24:32.371 --> 24:35.074
There was no Hesby arson.
I made it up.

24:35.174 --> 24:37.877
Why would you do that?
Collin's a liar.

24:37.977 --> 24:40.547
Why would he lie about
being Kirk O'Reilly's son?

24:42.081 --> 24:44.617
Cap, the truck's on fire.

24:44.717 --> 24:45.785
Whoa, whoa.

24:45.885 --> 24:47.353
Command, this is
Three Rock.

24:47.453 --> 24:49.689
We got a vehicle on fire
on the Charlie side.

24:49.789 --> 24:51.457
Is anyone in it?

25:18.084 --> 25:20.386
Come on. Who are you?

25:25.391 --> 25:27.393
Turn around.

25:27.493 --> 25:29.962
Let me see your face.

25:30.062 --> 25:33.032
Don't be Jake. Don't be Jake.

25:52.685 --> 25:55.054
All right, Three Rock,
put out those spots!

25:55.154 --> 25:57.790
Let's go! Let's go!

25:57.890 --> 26:00.159
Cars don't just burn like this.

26:01.160 --> 26:02.929
One car did recently.

26:03.029 --> 26:05.765
That developer's SUV from
the Wallace Development fire.

26:05.865 --> 26:09.902
Arsonist put some sort
of accelerant under it.

26:11.037 --> 26:13.205
Who has a drip torch
in their personal vehicle?

26:13.305 --> 26:15.074
I don't know, man.

26:15.174 --> 26:17.109
Cap...

26:17.209 --> 26:19.679
I think this is
the arsonist's truck.

26:19.779 --> 26:22.348
All right, that's it, boys!

26:22.448 --> 26:24.784
Don't let these flames grow!

26:25.551 --> 26:26.886
You got it, Cap.

26:28.621 --> 26:30.389
Hey, Danny!

26:30.489 --> 26:31.891
Danny!
Hold on, hold on.

26:31.991 --> 26:33.592
Danny, can you hear me?

26:33.693 --> 26:35.662
Down this way.
Down this way. Here.

26:36.763 --> 26:38.597
Hey, Danny,
we're coming to you.

26:38.698 --> 26:40.099
Hey, on your move.

26:42.969 --> 26:44.036
Take this.

26:44.136 --> 26:46.906
Okay, get ready.
Hit it!
Go! Go!

26:47.006 --> 26:49.809
Move. Move. Hit it!

26:52.444 --> 26:54.046
Danny, Danny, Danny,
hey, hey, listen.

26:54.146 --> 26:56.282
My name is Jake. That's my buddy
Collin over there, okay?

26:56.382 --> 26:57.784
We're here to help you.

26:57.884 --> 27:00.853
Jake, we got to go!
We don't have a lot of time!

27:00.953 --> 27:04.290
Danny.
Danny, can you hear me?

27:04.390 --> 27:06.759
I hear... gunshots.

27:06.859 --> 27:09.361
Nah. No, no, no,
buddy, not anymore.

27:09.461 --> 27:10.830
Listen. Listen, buddy, hey.

27:10.930 --> 27:13.099
Can you tell me
where are you right now?

27:13.199 --> 27:14.500
What?

27:14.600 --> 27:16.535
Well, you're not
with your dad.

27:16.635 --> 27:18.938
And you're not
handling guns, okay?

27:19.038 --> 27:20.606
Uh-huh.
Tell me, how about this?

27:20.707 --> 27:23.642
You tell me what you...
what you see and what you hear

27:23.743 --> 27:24.877
in this room right now.

27:26.445 --> 27:27.714
I see a window.

27:27.814 --> 27:29.581
Okay.
Books.

27:29.682 --> 27:31.784
Mm-hmm.
And... and a lamp.

27:31.884 --> 27:34.486
Good.
Okay, fire!
Do you see the fire?!

27:34.586 --> 27:36.188
Hey. Focus.

27:39.191 --> 27:41.027
Danny, good job.
Right here. Look at me.

27:41.127 --> 27:43.963
Good job.
Tell me, what do you feel?

27:44.063 --> 27:45.364
Huh? What do you feel?
Yeah.

27:45.464 --> 27:48.400
I feel the floor,
its warmth.

27:48.500 --> 27:49.601
Jake, we really got to go!

27:49.702 --> 27:51.570
We have to move!

27:51.670 --> 27:54.240
Last thing I need from you.
Can you tell me what you hear?

27:54.340 --> 27:56.075
I hear...

27:57.676 --> 27:59.111
The gunshots are gone. Exactly.

27:59.211 --> 28:00.747
They're gone, which means
it's safe for us to move, okay?

28:00.847 --> 28:02.048
Okay.
And my buddy Collin is right.

28:02.148 --> 28:03.816
We got to get out of here quickly.

28:03.916 --> 28:05.952
So, this is where
you're gonna help me out.

28:06.052 --> 28:08.855
Take my hand and let's move.
Come on, buddy.

28:08.955 --> 28:10.790
It's on my left side!
Got you.

28:18.330 --> 28:20.632
Okay, you're gonna
follow right behind him,

28:20.733 --> 28:21.968
and he's gonna take
you out of here. Go!

28:22.068 --> 28:24.036
All right! Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

28:24.136 --> 28:26.338
Stay low!
Move, move, move!

28:26.438 --> 28:29.208
Yeah, boys, you got this!

28:36.916 --> 28:39.585
Doing great, boys.
You're doing great.

28:40.386 --> 28:43.856
Hey, Collin's off today,
but he's on scene.

28:43.956 --> 28:46.658
So?
He must've driven himself here.

28:46.759 --> 28:48.961
Cap, I-I think
this is his truck.

28:49.061 --> 28:50.496
Wait, just because
he lied about his dad,

28:50.596 --> 28:51.798
you think he's the arsonist?

28:51.898 --> 28:53.265
No, no, that's not
just a random lie.

28:53.365 --> 28:55.401
Collin transferred
here from Arizona.

28:55.501 --> 28:57.603
How many people do you know
that live in Edgewater

28:57.703 --> 28:59.438
that have Arizona
license plates?

28:59.538 --> 29:01.073
Uh, I-I don't know.

29:01.173 --> 29:03.675
He wants to be... he wants to be
seen as something that he's not:

29:03.776 --> 29:05.211
a hero with hero's blood.

29:05.311 --> 29:07.479
This is the kind of
mentality of someone

29:07.579 --> 29:10.516
who sets fires so they can be
praised for putting them out.

29:10.616 --> 29:12.084
And he ratted out Jake.

29:12.184 --> 29:14.086
Why else would he do that?
All right, all right.

29:14.186 --> 29:15.754
I got a friend in the sheriff's
department, all right?

29:15.855 --> 29:17.289
I'll see if she can run
those plates for us.

29:17.389 --> 29:20.692
In the meantime, get back
to work and help out your boys.

29:22.494 --> 29:24.663
Damn it.

29:25.431 --> 29:26.899
All right, just down the stairs,
and we're home free!

29:26.999 --> 29:29.235
You hear that, Danny?
We're almost out.

29:30.702 --> 29:31.971
Move!

29:35.441 --> 29:36.943
Jake!

29:37.043 --> 29:39.578
Yeah, I'm okay, but I'm trapped.

29:39.678 --> 29:41.848
You get Danny out.

29:46.518 --> 29:48.787
Danny.
Oh, thank God.

29:48.888 --> 29:50.689
Are you okay?
Perez?

29:50.789 --> 29:52.324
Medical assessment.

29:52.424 --> 29:54.393
I got him, Chief.

29:55.895 --> 29:57.596
Mayday, Chief.

29:57.696 --> 30:00.632
I'm trapped
with limited visibility.

30:00.732 --> 30:03.735
Copy that. On the second.
Sending help now.

30:03.836 --> 30:05.071
I'm going back in.
Hey, hey!

30:05.171 --> 30:06.738
Wait!
Wait? Whoa, whoa.

30:06.839 --> 30:09.375
What do you mean, wait?
You're not going in alone.

30:09.475 --> 30:11.643
Two in, two out, probie.

30:11.743 --> 30:13.245
Mask up. You're going with him.

30:13.345 --> 30:14.780
Go!

30:16.115 --> 30:18.417
Is Jake still inside?
I thought I heard a mayday.

30:18.517 --> 30:20.819
Not for long.
We're going to get him.

30:21.921 --> 30:24.056
What?
There's real evidence now.

30:24.156 --> 30:26.292
I don't know
how long it is

30:26.392 --> 30:29.795
until they tie his fingerprints
to the scene, but it's coming.

30:29.896 --> 30:31.797
We got to get him to come clean,
to tell us everything

30:31.898 --> 30:33.966
so we can help,
so we can get him a lawyer.

30:34.066 --> 30:36.302
Hey, Jake's being set up.

30:36.402 --> 30:39.605
No, Bode. There's too
much evidence now.

30:39.705 --> 30:42.208
No, Mom, Cap and I
looked into it.

30:42.308 --> 30:46.312
Why can't anybody in this family
just stay out of it?

30:47.379 --> 30:48.547
It's not Jake.

30:48.647 --> 30:50.182
He was at the scene,

30:50.282 --> 30:52.151
and he lied to me about it, and
then he looked the other way

30:52.251 --> 30:54.786
when a drip torch went missing
from the station that ended up

30:54.887 --> 30:57.589
on the scene.
Drip torch?

30:58.657 --> 31:00.259
It certainly could be
one of ours.

31:00.359 --> 31:02.995
I'm telling you, Collin's
lying about who he is.

31:03.095 --> 31:04.596
He pointed the
finger at Jake,

31:04.696 --> 31:07.266
and his car is packed with
accelerant and drip torches.

31:07.366 --> 31:09.135
His personal car.

31:09.235 --> 31:11.070
Why-why is he
even here today?

31:11.170 --> 31:13.439
Are we sure that's his car?

31:16.775 --> 31:18.810
Yeah, those plates came back.

31:18.911 --> 31:20.913
Truck's registered
to Alex Shawcross.

31:21.013 --> 31:23.115
That name supposed
to mean something to me?

31:23.215 --> 31:24.850
No.

31:25.717 --> 31:27.419
But his picture will.

31:40.899 --> 31:42.401
Jake, we're en route.

31:42.501 --> 31:45.071
Can you confirm your location?

31:45.171 --> 31:46.905
Cut off.

31:48.007 --> 31:49.541
Second floor, Delta side.

31:49.641 --> 31:51.710
Attempting a wall breach.

32:15.067 --> 32:16.702
Jake?!

32:18.237 --> 32:20.006
Jake, where are you?!

32:20.106 --> 32:21.140
Jake?

32:21.240 --> 32:23.342
Yeah, I'm here.

32:23.442 --> 32:25.077
Jake, are you okay?

32:25.177 --> 32:28.814
Yeah. I nearly was a newspaper
headline, but I'm all right.

32:28.914 --> 32:30.582
Yeah, I got you, I got you.
No, no, no, no.

32:30.682 --> 32:32.851
Go, go, go. I'm good.
Come on, let's
get out of here!

32:32.951 --> 32:35.554
Come on, come on,
let's go! Move!

32:35.654 --> 32:37.123
Assistant Chief Snow.

32:37.223 --> 32:38.790
AFIS got a hit
on the fingerprint.

32:38.890 --> 32:41.060
You'll be happy to know
it's not Crawford's.

32:41.160 --> 32:44.196
Let me guess. They belong
to Collin O'Reilly,

32:44.296 --> 32:46.398
aka Alex Shawcross?

32:47.499 --> 32:49.201
Always one step ahead of me.

32:49.301 --> 32:51.303
Well, you had your
investigation, we had ours.

32:51.403 --> 32:54.540
There's some evidence here
that you're gonna want to see.

32:54.640 --> 32:55.941
I'm on my way.

32:56.042 --> 32:57.976
CHP should beat me there.

33:05.617 --> 33:08.554
We got to Jake just in time.

33:08.654 --> 33:11.923
What? No, we didn't.
He got himself out.

33:12.958 --> 33:14.860
Get him some O2.

33:14.960 --> 33:16.328
Come on!

33:16.428 --> 33:19.031
No.
Hey, hey, hey, back up,
back up, back up.

33:20.032 --> 33:21.400
O'Reilly,

33:21.500 --> 33:23.102
Captain Perez
is gonna check you

33:23.202 --> 33:24.503
for smoke inhalation.

33:25.337 --> 33:26.738
Go.

33:30.442 --> 33:32.611
Got to check you out,
Collin. Turn around.

33:32.711 --> 33:34.613
Or, uh, do you prefer Alex?

33:34.713 --> 33:37.449
Oh, whoa! What's going on, man?!

33:37.549 --> 33:39.785
Who's Alex?
The arsonist.

33:39.885 --> 33:40.652
What?

33:40.752 --> 33:41.953
Come on, man!

33:42.054 --> 33:43.089
What's going on?!

33:45.791 --> 33:47.326
I promise it's just a mistake.

33:47.426 --> 33:48.727
No, this is not a mistake.

33:48.827 --> 33:50.596
Our only mistake
was hiring you

33:50.696 --> 33:52.998
and taking you at face value
that you were a nugget.

33:53.099 --> 33:54.633
Hey.

33:54.733 --> 33:56.102
He's not Kirk O'Reilly's son?

33:56.202 --> 33:58.170
Not even close.

33:58.270 --> 34:01.973
He's just a guy who gets off
on trying to be the hero, right?

34:02.841 --> 34:04.076
Excuse me! Behind you!

34:12.651 --> 34:14.720
You manufactured evidence
to point at Jake.

34:14.820 --> 34:17.723
You inventing a trauma

34:17.823 --> 34:20.559
just to bond over is sick, man.

34:21.427 --> 34:23.095
You're sick.

34:29.335 --> 34:32.238
I welcomed you into my house.

34:32.338 --> 34:35.374
You messed
with my family.

34:35.474 --> 34:38.410
Made us question
one of our own?

34:38.510 --> 34:40.779
No.

34:40.879 --> 34:43.615
Actually, that one's on me.

34:45.016 --> 34:46.518
Jake...

34:46.618 --> 34:48.787
I am sorry.

34:53.492 --> 34:56.027
You know, you're
just a coward.

34:56.128 --> 34:57.896
You had to know
that at some point,

34:57.996 --> 34:59.631
somebody was gonna see
Kirk O'Reilly's obituary

34:59.731 --> 35:01.967
and figure out that
he didn't have any kids.

35:02.067 --> 35:04.436
What can I say?

35:04.536 --> 35:07.038
The bigger the lie,
the bigger the thrill?

35:08.807 --> 35:10.842
Get him out of my face, Manny.

35:10.942 --> 35:14.180
Pleasure, Chief. Let's go.

35:19.084 --> 35:23.689
So the real arsonist was
under your nose the whole time,

35:23.789 --> 35:27.259
but you two accused me.

35:30.162 --> 35:32.531
Why?

35:34.132 --> 35:38.470
One lie and a mistake I made
as a kid makes me an arsonist?

35:38.570 --> 35:40.306
Negates all of the trust

35:40.406 --> 35:41.640
that I've built with you?

35:41.740 --> 35:43.074
No, no! I hated
every minute of this,

35:43.175 --> 35:45.143
but those clues--
they just kept coming.

35:45.244 --> 35:48.046
Why... why were you
in Drake County? Why?

35:52.951 --> 35:55.621
You're still asking
the wrong question.

36:07.433 --> 36:10.336
Checked off
18-foot ladder today.
Oh, but for what?

36:10.436 --> 36:11.970
I mean, I pulled it off,
and all anybody could see

36:12.070 --> 36:13.872
was how I failed
to save Danny.

36:13.972 --> 36:17.276
Well, I hate to break it
to you, probie,

36:17.376 --> 36:19.378
but literally nobody saw that.

36:19.478 --> 36:21.213
What do you mean?

36:21.313 --> 36:23.449
I went up
and came back down without him.

36:23.549 --> 36:26.418
That's your story,
not the story.

36:26.518 --> 36:28.987
Danny's story is
he didn't die today.

36:29.087 --> 36:32.958
His mom's story is
she almost killed her son

36:33.058 --> 36:36.127
because she refused
to talk about this tragedy.

36:36.228 --> 36:38.264
For me,

36:38.364 --> 36:41.233
just another day at work.

36:41.333 --> 36:44.536
And Jake?

36:45.871 --> 36:48.574
Nobody's looking at you, Gabs.

36:48.674 --> 36:50.976
Everybody's inside
their own story.

36:58.149 --> 37:01.287
Cap's famous burritos?
What's...

37:01.387 --> 37:02.788
What's the occasion?

37:02.888 --> 37:04.856
Oh, no. You're moving out,
aren't you?

37:04.956 --> 37:07.526
Yes, ma'am, I am, but...

37:07.626 --> 37:09.160
not until
I actually find a place.

37:10.529 --> 37:12.331
No. This, uh...
this arson investigation,

37:12.431 --> 37:17.569
it made me realize
just kind of how enmeshed I am

37:17.669 --> 37:19.438
in everything Leone, you know?

37:19.538 --> 37:21.440
Ah, and you don't love that?
I mean...
Well, uh, yeah...

37:21.540 --> 37:24.376
Yeah, I'm just saying that...
I tried to focus on work today,

37:24.476 --> 37:27.513
and I just kept getting sucked
back into the personal,

37:27.613 --> 37:30.882
and I think... you know, uh,
it's time to draw a line.

37:30.982 --> 37:33.785
Well, boundaries
are a good thing.

37:33.885 --> 37:35.621
Mm-hmm.
Exactly.

37:35.721 --> 37:39.090
And that's why sleeping
in your boss's living room is

37:39.190 --> 37:41.393
the exact opposite,
so I got to go.

37:46.398 --> 37:47.799
Look, you...

37:47.899 --> 37:51.303
you guys know that
Jake will forgive you, right?

37:51.403 --> 37:53.271
He will. You just...

37:53.372 --> 37:56.308
You got to give him some time.
That's all.

37:56.408 --> 37:58.344
Okay.

38:01.212 --> 38:03.315
Come on, let's eat
while it's still hot.

38:03.415 --> 38:05.150
Smells so good.

38:09.321 --> 38:11.790
You know, when you and I
were growing up, man,

38:11.890 --> 38:13.359
we were so close.

38:13.459 --> 38:16.862
Everybody always said
we were like brothers.

38:16.962 --> 38:19.365
Family's...
family's never easy.

38:19.465 --> 38:22.901
Yeah, well, I kept saying
I wasn't the arsonist.

38:24.536 --> 38:26.338
And I wasn't.

38:27.673 --> 38:29.074
Pretty easy.

38:30.442 --> 38:32.778
And I had faith in you,

38:32.878 --> 38:35.414
no questions asked,
wh-which you deserve,

38:35.514 --> 38:38.984
but, uh, then I'm-I'm
blindsided by this secret

38:39.084 --> 38:40.686
that you started a fire
as a kid...

38:40.786 --> 38:43.288
Yeah, exactly, as a kid, Bode.

38:44.089 --> 38:47.092
But what have I done
since then to deserve this?

38:47.192 --> 38:51.863
Anyway, Jake, what...
what else don't I know?

38:55.434 --> 38:57.469
A lot, Bode.

38:57.569 --> 38:59.805
A lot.

39:00.806 --> 39:02.908
It's not that I don't appreciate

39:03.008 --> 39:06.912
that your parents
covered up the fire I started.

39:08.514 --> 39:10.048
It's just that I wish

39:10.148 --> 39:13.051
someone would've asked me
why I did it.

39:15.220 --> 39:17.756
Why did you set the fire?

39:26.598 --> 39:28.033
I had just found out

39:28.133 --> 39:31.269
that my dad was having a baby
with another woman.

39:32.070 --> 39:37.175
Man, I was terrified...
that he was going to leave us.

39:42.914 --> 39:45.083
So the fire was
a cry for help?

39:46.885 --> 39:49.855
I never told anyone that, man.

39:49.955 --> 39:51.957
Because when you're 11

39:52.057 --> 39:55.326
and you learn
your dad's secret...

39:56.595 --> 39:59.230
...but then he dies...

40:01.032 --> 40:03.234
...you keep that, Bode.

40:04.603 --> 40:05.871
And ever since then,

40:05.971 --> 40:08.239
I really don't know
the line between

40:08.339 --> 40:11.777
what to keep and what to share.

40:22.788 --> 40:24.756
I'm so sorry.

40:24.856 --> 40:27.258
Ask me why
I went to Drake County.

40:29.695 --> 40:32.864
I-I... I don't care, man.
No, I believe you.

40:32.964 --> 40:34.299
No. Come on.

40:34.399 --> 40:37.335
Sit down, please. Bode, please.

40:48.079 --> 40:50.816
Listen, man, when I...

40:50.916 --> 40:54.385
failed to save your mom...

40:56.622 --> 40:58.557
...that broke me, Bode.

40:58.657 --> 41:00.992
Yeah, I know.

41:01.092 --> 41:06.031
Your mom said she would never
take your kidney,

41:06.131 --> 41:10.001
so I don't know why,
but I thought that...

41:10.101 --> 41:12.838
well, hey, since I was a match,
maybe this kid

41:12.938 --> 41:16.742
that my dad fathered
would be, too.

41:16.842 --> 41:18.977
It's magical thinking.

41:20.812 --> 41:23.549
That is so unlikely.
I know.

41:23.649 --> 41:27.586
But I tracked him down anyway.

41:27.686 --> 41:31.156
He lives in Drake County.

41:35.694 --> 41:38.129
B, I saw this kid.

41:40.031 --> 41:42.467
I matched
the pictures online.

41:43.669 --> 41:48.406
And a part of me
always wanted to find him.

41:50.008 --> 41:53.511
Maybe that's why I was
expecting to feel like...

41:55.513 --> 41:57.382
...that's my brother.

42:02.554 --> 42:05.023
But he was a stranger.

42:07.793 --> 42:10.195
So, between that...

42:13.031 --> 42:16.067
...and, well,
everything that I've done

42:16.167 --> 42:18.436
to protect this house...

42:20.739 --> 42:22.540
...and everyone in it...

42:25.476 --> 42:29.848
...to look up today and not see
one of them have my back?

42:30.682 --> 42:34.252
I've never felt
so alone in my life.

42:37.823 --> 42:40.358
All right, hey.

42:42.661 --> 42:44.796
You have a brother in me.

42:44.896 --> 42:48.366
Always.
