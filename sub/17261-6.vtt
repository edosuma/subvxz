THE WAY THEY ARE, GUV'NA."

09:04.543 --> 09:07.296
- I SOUND NOTHING LIKE THAT.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.674
DWAYNE, I WANT TO GO BLONDE.

09:09.757 --> 09:10.883
NOT JUST BLONDE.

09:10.967 --> 09:11.842
PLATINUM.

09:11.926 --> 09:14.178
[both gasp]

09:14.262 --> 09:16.847
- [whispers]
I'LL GET THE BLEACH.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.814
- HELLO, STRANGER.

09:29.235 --> 09:31.570
I KNOW.
IT'S A BIT DIFFERENT.

09:31.654 --> 09:32.947
THE STYLIST THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE BETTER

09:33.030 --> 09:34.699
IF MY EYEBROWS AND EYELASHES
MATCHED, BUT I--

09:34.782 --> 09:35.700
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

09:35.783 --> 09:37.201
YOU GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE.

09:37.285 --> 09:38.995
YOU LOOK LIKE AN ALBINO,
AND DEBBIE'S COMING.

09:39.078 --> 09:40.329
- SO?

09:40.413 --> 09:42.498
WHAT DOES DEBBIE HAVE
TO DO WITH THIS?

09:42.581 --> 09:43.749
- THAT.

09:47.712 --> 09:50.006
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
SHE WAS AN ALBINO?

09:50.089 --> 09:54.051
- BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE GOING TO <i> BE</i> AN ALBINO.

09:54.135 --> 09:55.845
BESIDES, IT SOUNDED RACIST.

09:55.928 --> 09:57.388
- IS IT A RACE?

09:57.471 --> 10:00.224
- SHH.

10:00.308 --> 10:01.976
- HEY, OWEN.

10:02.059 --> 10:04.520
- DEBBIE, THIS IS MY MOM, JOY.

10:04.603 --> 10:05.646
- HI.

10:05.730 --> 10:07.857
DON'T WORRY.
THIS WAS A MISTAKE.

10:07.940 --> 10:08.941
BE BACK TO NORMAL SOON.

10:09.025 --> 10:10.026
NOT "NORMAL."

10:10.109 --> 10:11.485
YOU LOOK NORMAL,

10:11.569 --> 10:13.237
IF NORMAL IS
INCREDIBLY BEAUTIFUL.

10:13.321 --> 10:15.489
GOSH, I'D GO OUT WITH YOU IF--

10:15.573 --> 10:17.533
IF YOU WEREN'T DATING MY SON
AND I WAS GAY AND YOU WERE.

10:17.616 --> 10:19.493
WHY DOESN'T SOMEBODY ELSE TALK?

10:21.787 --> 10:24.248
- YOU KNOW, I'M GETTING KIND OF
A WEIRD VIBE HERE, OWEN.

10:24.332 --> 10:27.376
I'LL SEE YOU BACK AT WORK.

10:34.800 --> 10:36.260
- SO...

10:36.344 --> 10:39.388
ANYONE ELSE AT THE OFFICE
YOU LIKE?

10:46.145 --> 10:49.398
- ELKA, ARE YOU BREAKING UP
WITH ME?

10:49.482 --> 10:52.902
- DON'T ACT LIKE
IT WAS MORE THAN IT WAS.

10:52.985 --> 10:57.573
WE WERE JUST
ENEMIES WITH BENEFITS.

10:57.656 --> 11:00.117
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

11:00.201 --> 11:03.245
IT'S BEST
FOR BOTH OF OUR CAREERS.

11:03.329 --> 11:08.959
- NO MORE SEXY TEXTS
DURING COUNCIL MEETINGS.

11:09.043 --> 11:11.379
- NO MORE LETTING OUR HANDS

11:11.462 --> 11:14.632
LINGER ON THE SHOVEL
AT GROUND-BREAKINGS.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.426
- GO NOW.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.220
DON'T LOOK BACK.

11:38.531 --> 11:39.657
- WOW, YOU REALLY DID IT.

11:39.740 --> 11:43.661
- YES, BUT ONLY BECAUSE YOU
AND VICTORIA WERE IN MY HEAD.

11:43.744 --> 11:46.080
AND THEN I SAW OWEN, AND HE
WAS ON A DATE WITH DEBBIE.

11:46.163 --> 11:47.623
- YAY!
- NO, MELANIE.

11:47.706 --> 11:48.958
NOT YAY.

11:49.041 --> 11:50.584
DEBBIE'S AN ALBINO.

11:50.668 --> 11:53.754
- OH, MY GOD,
AND YOU LOOK LIKE AN ALBINO.

11:53.838 --> 11:54.755
DID SHE NOTICE?

11:54.839 --> 11:57.925
- YEAH, SHE DID.

11:58.008 --> 11:59.635
- OH, MY GOD.

11:59.718 --> 12:01.303
- I KNOW.
MY HAIR.

12:01.387 --> 12:05.141
- JOY, THIS IS NOT ABOUT YOU
AND HOW TERRIBLE YOU LOOK.

12:05.224 --> 12:06.976
I HAVE TO SLEEP IN A CAVE

12:07.059 --> 12:09.603
BECAUSE YOU TWO SAID THAT
I DIDN'T READ CONTRACTS.

12:09.687 --> 12:12.648
OH, HOW THE HELL
AM I GONNA SURVIVE IN THE WILD?

12:12.731 --> 12:15.693
I CAN BARELY MAKE IT
THROUGH A NIGHT AT THE RADISSON.

12:15.776 --> 12:18.028
- SEE, THIS IS THE PROBLEM
WITH WOMEN LIVING TOGETHER.

12:18.112 --> 12:19.321
WE'RE IN EACH OTHER'S HEADS.

12:19.405 --> 12:20.656
OUR MIND CYCLES ARE SYNCED.

12:20.739 --> 12:21.657
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

12:21.740 --> 12:23.325
WE HAVE PMS.

12:23.409 --> 12:25.661
PERSISTENT MENTAL...

12:25.744 --> 12:27.455
SOMETHING.

12:27.538 --> 12:28.581
WHAT DO WE DO?

12:28.664 --> 12:30.708
- WHAT WOMEN HAVE DONE
FOR CENTURIES:

12:30.791 --> 12:33.669
DRINK, EAT CHOCOLATE, AND TRY
TO STAY AWAY FROM EACH OTHER.

12:33.752 --> 12:37.256
- AND STAY AWAY FROM ME
WHILE YOU'RE AT IT.

12:38.716 --> 12:41.427
- WAIT, WHOSE HEAD IS SHE IN?

12:46.557 --> 12:50.519
- HI, I'M BEAR THOMAS,
AND THIS DARK, DAMP, REMOTE CAVE

12:50.603 --> 12:53.522
IS GONNA BE VICTORIA CHASE'S
BEDROOM FOR THE NIGHT.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.649
ALL THAT STANDS BETWEEN HER
AND THE ELEMENTS

12:55.733 --> 12:59.195
IS A SLEEPING BAG
AND A BOTTLE OF PALEO VODKA.

12:59.278 --> 13:00.863
I'M GONNA LEAVE HER NOW.
- WHAT?

13:00.946 --> 13:02.865
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

13:02.948 --> 13:06.452
YOU HAVE TO PROTECT ME
AGAINST ALL THIS NATURE.

13:06.535 --> 13:07.870
- THE WHOLE POINT
OF THE PROMOTION IS

13:07.953 --> 13:10.706
YOU HERE AGAINST THE ELEMENTS.

13:10.789 --> 13:14.084
THE GOOD NEWS IS, ALL THE BUGS
IN THIS CAVE ARE EDIBLE.

13:14.168 --> 13:15.211
OH, AND THE BATS WON'T COME OUT

13:15.294 --> 13:17.463
UNLESS YOU MAKE A SUDDEN
MOVEMENT OR SCREAM IN FEAR.

13:17.546 --> 13:18.422
- [whimpers]

13:18.506 --> 13:20.674
- SEE YOU TOMORROW.

13:20.758 --> 13:22.134
- [whines]

13:22.218 --> 13:24.720
[bats chitter and flutter]

13:30.100 --> 13:33.062
- OH.
I'M SO ALONE.

13:33.145 --> 13:35.564
THE ONLY VOICE IN MY HEAD
IS MY OWN,

13:35.648 --> 13:39.902
SAYING, "WHY DIDN'T YOU READ
YOUR [bleep] CONTRACT?"

13:39.985 --> 13:42.947
OH, I WISH
MELANIE WAS IN MY HEAD.

13:43.030 --> 13:44.698
SHE'D KNOW WHAT TO DO.

13:44.782 --> 13:47.409
- HEY, HOW COME YOU DIDN'T
WANT ME IN YOUR HEAD?

13:47.493 --> 13:48.702
- BECAUSE I'M BETTER
IN A CRISIS.

13:48.786 --> 13:50.204
IF YOU CAN'T DRINK IT
OR SLEEP WITH IT,

13:50.287 --> 13:51.747
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

13:51.830 --> 13:53.123
- GOOD ONE, VICTORIA.

13:53.207 --> 13:54.708
- THAT WAS MY LINE.

13:54.792 --> 13:57.086
- NO, BUT I'M THE ONE
IMAGINING YOU SAYING IT.

13:57.169 --> 13:58.921
NOW, HELP ME.

13:59.004 --> 14:00.297
HOW AM I GONNA GET
THROUGH THE NIGHT?

14:00.381 --> 14:02.591
- YOU'RE AN ACTRESS.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.718
all: AN ACADEMY AWARD-WINNING
ACTRESS.

14:04.802 --> 14:07.888
- I NEVER GET TIRED
OF THINKING IT.

14:07.972 --> 14:10.266
- JUST ACT LIKE
YOU'RE NOT IN A CAVE.

14:10.349 --> 14:13.811
YOU'RE IN THE CAVE ROOM
OF AN EXCLUSIVE OUTDOOR SPA.

14:13.894 --> 14:15.604
GWYNETH TRIED TO BOOK IT BUT WAS
TOLD YOU WERE MORE IMPORTANT.

14:15.688 --> 14:17.565
- THERE'S NOBODY HERE
TO IMPRESS,

14:17.648 --> 14:19.275
SO YOU DON'T HAVE
TO PRETEND TO READ A BOOK.

14:19.358 --> 14:21.652
AND INSTEAD OF CUCUMBER WATER,
YOU HAVE...

14:21.735 --> 14:23.571
- VODKA.

14:25.239 --> 14:27.658
OH, I LIKE
THE WAY I'M THINKING.

14:31.537 --> 14:33.664
- I AM SO SORRY
ABOUT THE OTHER NIGHT.

14:33.747 --> 14:35.165
- THAT'S OKAY.

14:35.249 --> 14:38.586
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, I HAVE
NOT HAD SEX WITH WOMEN BEFORE.

14:38.669 --> 14:40.129
- [laughs]

14:40.212 --> 14:41.338
- DO YOU WANT TO COME AROUND
AGAIN TONIGHT

14:41.422 --> 14:44.800
FOR A NICE EVENING IN?

14:44.883 --> 14:47.011
- OR...

14:47.094 --> 14:49.305
WE COULD BE NAUGHTY AND DO IT
RIGHT NOW IN THE BATHROOM.

14:49.388 --> 14:50.806
- [shouts]
THE BATH--

14:50.889 --> 14:52.558
[whispers]
THE BATHROOM?

14:55.060 --> 14:56.020
I'VE NEVER DONE IT
IN PUBLIC BEFORE.

14:56.103 --> 14:57.104
- [mouths words]

14:57.187 --> 14:58.647
- BACK IN NEW ZEALAND,

14:58.731 --> 15:02.192
I HAD A SENSUAL ENCOUNTER
AT A BUS STOP ONCE.

15:02.276 --> 15:06.155
BUT IT WAS INTERRUPTED BY SHEEP.

15:06.238 --> 15:07.531
- MEET ME
IN THE HANDICAP BATHROOM.

15:07.615 --> 15:09.199
FIVE MINUTES.

15:09.283 --> 15:10.284
- SOUNDS NAUGHTY.

15:10.367 --> 15:11.869
- OH, SUPER NAUGHTY.

15:11.952 --> 15:14.622
BECAUSE IF WE GET CAUGHT
IN THE HANDICAP BATHROOM,

15:14.705 --> 15:15.873
WE HAVE TO PAY A FINE.

15:15.956 --> 15:17.750
- [gasps excitedly]

15:28.594 --> 15:32.014
[toilet flushes]
- OH!

15:32.097 --> 15:33.849
OH, HOW DO YOU MAKE
A BATHROOM SEXY?

15:33.932 --> 15:35.184
I WISH JOY WERE HERE.

15:35.267 --> 15:37.686
- WHY DID YOU THINK OF ME FIRST?

15:37.770 --> 15:40.022
- EXACTLY.
I'VE HAD SEX IN BATHROOMS.

15:40.105 --> 15:41.649
- YEAH, BUT ADMIT IT.

15:41.732 --> 15:44.693
YOU THINK OF JOY FIRST.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.320
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

15:46.403 --> 15:49.073
- I JUST CAME BY TO SAY THAT.

15:52.493 --> 15:54.036
- OKAY, YOU GUYS, WHAT DO I DO?

15:54.119 --> 15:55.871
- WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
YOU HAVE TO BE DRUNK ENOUGH

15:55.954 --> 15:58.499
TO FORGET
YOU'RE IN A PUBLIC BATHROOM.

15:58.582 --> 16:01.043
- I'M NOT DRUNK.
IT'S LUNCHTIME.

16:01.126 --> 16:03.045
- OH, MELANIE, THIS ISN'T YOU.

16:03.128 --> 16:06.048
AND NOT BEING YOURSELF IS
THE WORST SEX OF ALL.

16:06.131 --> 16:08.217
- I THOUGHT YOU SAID NICE SEX
WAS THE WORST SEX OF ALL.

16:08.300 --> 16:09.718
- WHAT DO WE KNOW?
WE'RE NOT NICE.

16:09.802 --> 16:12.096
WE'VE NEVER HAD NICE SEX.

16:12.179 --> 16:13.222
MAYBE IT'S GOOD.

16:13.305 --> 16:14.765
- IT IS GOOD.
- [knocks]

16:17.601 --> 16:19.395
OOH, ROOMY, ISN'T IT?

16:19.478 --> 16:23.232
- [chuckles]
- LOTS OF SPACE FOR SEX.

16:23.315 --> 16:25.567
AND, OF COURSE, BACTERIA.

16:25.651 --> 16:27.611
- JACK, I'M SORRY.
THIS ISN'T ME.

16:27.695 --> 16:29.363
AND I'M--I'M SENSING
THIS ISN'T YOU EITHER.

16:29.446 --> 16:30.906
- MM.

16:30.989 --> 16:33.242
- AND NOT BEING YOURSELF
IS THE WORST SEX OF ALL.

16:33.325 --> 16:37.413
- WELL, ACTUALLY, NOT HAVING SEX
IS THE WORST SEX OF ALL.

16:37.496 --> 16:39.373
SHALL WE GO BACK TO MY PLACE?
- YES, PLEASE.

16:39.456 --> 16:40.833
- AND IF YOU STILL WANT
TO SPICE THINGS UP,

16:40.916 --> 16:43.877
I DO HAVE A SCENTED CANDLE
CALLED "MOROCCAN SUNDAYS,"

16:43.961 --> 16:46.588
WHICH WOULD BE RATHER NAUGHTY
TO LIGHT, AS TODAY'S TUESDAY.

16:46.672 --> 16:48.215
- [laughs]

16:48.298 --> 16:49.883
- HI, DEBBIE.

16:49.967 --> 16:51.427
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

16:51.510 --> 16:53.637
- OH, MY GOD,
HOW DID YOU KNOW I WAS HERE?

16:53.721 --> 16:55.431
- I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING YOU
ALL DAY

16:55.514 --> 16:58.726
BUT NOT IN A CREEPY WAY.

16:58.809 --> 17:00.436
- HOW IS THAT NOT CREEPY?

17:00.519 --> 17:03.564
- BECAUSE MY SON NEEDS
A COMPANION SATURDAY NIGHTS,

17:03.647 --> 17:06.023
AND IT CAN'T BE ME ANYMORE.

17:06.108 --> 17:07.608
LOOK...

17:07.693 --> 17:10.445
I'VE TEXTED OWEN.
HE'S ON HIS WAY HERE.

17:10.529 --> 17:12.823
AND I WAS HOPING
TO SMOOTH THINGS OVER WITH YOU,

17:12.906 --> 17:14.366
SO YOU'D GIVE HIM
ANOTHER CHANCE.

17:14.450 --> 17:16.076
- NO, YOU ARE CRAZY.

17:16.160 --> 17:19.121
LEAVE ME ALONE,
OR I'M CALLING THE POLICE.

17:19.204 --> 17:21.707
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.
I'M LEAVING.

17:26.086 --> 17:27.296
- YOU CAN'T GIVE UP LIKE THAT.

17:27.378 --> 17:28.964
HAVE SOME CONFIDENCE.

17:29.048 --> 17:32.092
- NOW GET BACK IN THERE,
AND DO WHAT I DO WITH MY KIDS.

17:32.176 --> 17:33.302
WHEN WE'VE HURT EACH OTHER,

17:33.385 --> 17:34.803
WE START ALL OVER AGAIN

17:34.887 --> 17:36.638
AND DO IT THE WAY
WE WISH WE'D DONE IT.

17:36.722 --> 17:38.974
WE CALL IT A DO-OVER.
THIS ONE TIME WITH JENNA--

17:39.057 --> 17:40.476
- YOU DO REALIZE THAT
YOU CAN MAKE HER STOP TALKING

17:40.559 --> 17:42.144
AT ANY TIME.

17:47.733 --> 17:50.277
- HELLO, I'M JOY SCROGGS.

17:50.360 --> 17:52.654
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

17:52.738 --> 17:55.324
- I'D LIKE TO TRY A DO-OVER.

17:55.407 --> 17:58.744
I'M SORRY FOR THE WAY
THINGS STARTED WITH US.

17:58.827 --> 18:01.497
MY SON REALLY LIKES YOU.

18:01.580 --> 18:06.502
HE SAYS EVERY OTHER WOMAN
PALES IN COMPARISON TO Y--

18:06.585 --> 18:10.339
NOT PALES.

18:10.422 --> 18:13.050
LOOK, OWEN IS A GREAT GUY,

18:13.133 --> 18:15.177
AND YOU SHOULD GIVE HIM
ANOTHER CHANCE.

18:15.260 --> 18:17.179
- MOM, WHAT'S GOING ON?

18:17.262 --> 18:20.849
DEBBIE, I AM SO SORRY.
THIS WOMAN IS CRAZY.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.643
- OH, SHE IS CRAZY,

18:22.726 --> 18:25.687
BUT SHE ALSO SAID THAT I SHOULD
GIVE YOU A SECOND CHANCE.

18:25.771 --> 18:27.981
AND BESIDES,
A NICE GUY LIKE YOU

18:28.065 --> 18:30.108
SHOULDN'T BE SPENDING ALL OF HIS
SATURDAY NIGHTS WITH HIS MOTHER.

18:30.192 --> 18:32.694
- WHA--

18:32.778 --> 18:35.155
YOU TOLD HER THAT?

18:35.239 --> 18:38.033
- WOULD YOU LIKE
TO JOIN ME FOR A DRINK?

18:38.116 --> 18:39.159
- I WOULD.

18:43.121 --> 18:45.499
- OH, THIS IS SO CUTE.

18:45.582 --> 18:46.500
- MOM.

18:46.583 --> 18:49.169
- GOING.
TOTALLY GOING.

18:51.255 --> 18:53.257
BUT SO CUTE.

18:58.470 --> 18:59.388
- YOU KNOW, JOY,

18:59.471 --> 19:01.056
I'M REALLY STARTING
TO GET USED TO THE HAIR.

19:01.139 --> 19:02.182
- I'M LOVING IT.

19:02.266 --> 19:03.433
- I'M CHANGING IT BACK TOMORROW.

19:03.517 --> 19:06.854
- OH, THANK GOD.
- IT'S HIDEOUS.

19:06.937 --> 19:10.607
- GROW YOUR MUSTACHE OUT,
YOU'LL LOOK LIKE MARK TWAIN.

19:14.278 --> 19:16.947
- SO HOW'D THINGS GO WITH JACK?

19:17.030 --> 19:19.241
- WELL, MY FRIENDS,
THERE IS A REASON

19:19.324 --> 19:21.785
THAT VANILLA IS THE MOST POPULAR
FLAVOR OF ICE CREAM

19:21.869 --> 19:23.745
