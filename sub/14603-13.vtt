WEBVTT

00:00.720 --> 00:04.230
Before there was sex,
before there was the city,

00:04.265 --> 00:07.540
there was just me-Carrie.
Carrie Bradshaw.

00:07.575 --> 00:09.122
And lots of things are changing...

00:09.157 --> 00:10.635
Larissa said that if I do a good job,

00:10.670 --> 00:13.100
she might hire me as her
full-time assistant over the summer.

00:13.135 --> 00:14.065
For all of us.

00:14.100 --> 00:16.020
- Do you like me?
- I do like you. So what?

00:16.055 --> 00:17.385
I like you too.

00:17.420 --> 00:18.320
Is that Mr. Bradshaw?

00:18.330 --> 00:20.220
Yeah,it is.
Let's go.

00:20.230 --> 00:23.670
We made out in your car
and got coffee a couple times.

00:23.705 --> 00:25.635
Kids don't really know
that I'm dating you.

00:25.670 --> 00:28.665
Admit it. It's always more fun
when you're with me.

00:28.700 --> 00:30.030
Did you give me that book
so I'd want to have sex with you?

00:31.030 --> 00:33.045
- No.
- I've been thinking about it a lot.

00:33.080 --> 00:35.070
Why do you have to think
so much about evything?

00:35.105 --> 00:36.342
Because that'who I am.

00:36.377 --> 00:37.545
If that's the way you feel

00:37.580 --> 00:39.450
then mabe we should just break up.

00:39.485 --> 00:41.740
If that'what you want, fine

00:45.000 --> 00:46.865
There's a brief moment when you wake up

00:46.900 --> 00:50.450
where you have no memories-
a blissful blank slate,

00:50.610 --> 00:52.240
a happy emptiness.

00:52.290 --> 00:53.825
But it doesn't last long,

00:53.860 --> 00:55.795
And you remember
exactly where you were

00:55.830 --> 00:57.695
and what you
were trying to forget-

00:57.730 --> 01:00.700
totally painful
gutly-wrenching break up.

01:02.160 --> 01:03.540
And the worst part-

01:03.680 --> 01:06.790
you have no one to be angry
with except yourself.

01:07.550 --> 01:09.330
Now the only thing
i could remember

01:09.340 --> 01:10.695
about me and Sebastian

01:10.730 --> 01:12.050
was how happy I was..

01:16.510 --> 01:17.980
And now I wasn't.

01:23.420 --> 01:24.955
Please!
You were not happy.

01:24.990 --> 01:26.640
You are always complaining
about him.

01:26.675 --> 01:27.880
And miserable.

01:27.890 --> 01:29.490
Absolutely miserable!

01:29.525 --> 01:30.145
I was?

01:30.180 --> 01:33.260
Totally, because he was
so needy and demanding

01:33.295 --> 01:35.032
and not even that cute.

01:35.067 --> 01:36.770
He's ugly, really. Oops.

01:37.050 --> 01:38.020
You went too far.

01:38.030 --> 01:38.855
Too far with what?

01:38.890 --> 01:40.135
We don't actually believe
any of these stuff.

01:40.170 --> 01:41.890
We're just trying to make you
feel better about the breakup.

01:41.925 --> 01:42.912
We feel awful for you guys.

01:42.947 --> 01:43.865
You were great together.

01:43.900 --> 01:46.870
- And right before prom.
- Breaking up before prom might

01:46.905 --> 01:49.840
actually be worse than getting dumped
near Valentine's Day.

01:50.240 --> 01:53.720
It's like walking to a giant spotlight
of pain and embarrassment.

01:53.800 --> 01:54.745
"Look at me, everyone.

01:54.780 --> 01:57.390
I have pretty dress
and no one to share it with"

01:57.425 --> 01:59.610
- Did you already buy the dress?
- I did.

01:59.645 --> 02:00.867
Maybe Mouse could ask some of

02:00.902 --> 02:02.261
West's cute basketball buddies

02:02.296 --> 02:03.620
what they're doing for prom.

02:03.770 --> 02:05.465
I'm not going to prom with West.

02:05.500 --> 02:08.350
Wait. Did I miss something?
Are-are you guys breaking up?

02:08.384 --> 02:11.530
No. It's because of my parents.

02:11.540 --> 02:12.665
Do they not like West?

02:12.700 --> 02:14.180
They do not know there is a West,

02:14.200 --> 02:16.180
and I would like
to keep it that way.

02:16.430 --> 02:17.735
They will never approve.

02:17.770 --> 02:20.590
I'm not exactly sure
how to ask this, but...

02:20.840 --> 02:22.600
Are your parents racist?

02:22.635 --> 02:24.360
Duh! Of course they are.

02:24.760 --> 02:26.365
Against anyone who isn't Chinese.

02:26.400 --> 02:27.870
How come we've
never heard about this?

02:27.905 --> 02:29.870
Because it sounds crazy.

02:29.880 --> 02:31.055
But my Chinese heritage is

02:31.090 --> 02:33.600
even more important
to them than Harvard.

02:33.635 --> 02:36.427
We're direct descendants
of the Qing Dynasty.

02:36.462 --> 02:39.220
- Okay, who cares?
- My parents, that's who.

02:39.840 --> 02:42.535
If I am ever allowed to date-

02:42.570 --> 02:44.675
and that probably can't happen
until after Harvard-

02:44.710 --> 02:48.000
then it has to be someone
who's also from the Qing Dynasty,

02:48.100 --> 02:50.510
like my parents'best friends' son...

02:51.360 --> 02:53.860
Eugene

02:54.030 --> 02:55.720
Eugene.
That does not sound promising.

02:55.755 --> 02:56.465
Trust me...

02:56.500 --> 02:58.910
when I say it is
the opposite of promising.

02:58.945 --> 03:01.320
- Does West know?
- I haven't told him.

03:01.355 --> 03:03.100
But I'm sure he'll understand.

03:03.350 --> 03:05.690
So none of us are going to the prom?

03:05.830 --> 03:08.460
Maybe we could still go-
the three of us.

03:08.630 --> 03:09.830
It could still be fun.

03:10.040 --> 03:11.115
Yeah, maybe.

03:11.150 --> 03:14.160
Like a trouple.
We'd make a very cute trouple.

03:14.170 --> 03:15.740
We would.

03:19.140 --> 03:20.440
Wait. Is that...

03:25.200 --> 03:26.200
Yeah.

03:29.010 --> 03:30.010
Simon

03:30.350 --> 03:32.810
Hi. I'm Noelle, Simon's fiancee.

03:33.250 --> 03:34.320
Maggie.

03:35.230 --> 03:36.640
Congratutions.

03:36.840 --> 03:39.550
Thanks. Super excited.

03:40.050 --> 03:41.800
Maggie's the chief's daughter.

03:42.800 --> 03:45.540
I don't wanna keep you guys
from your lunch, so...

03:45.575 --> 03:46.690
Of course.

03:47.590 --> 03:48.650
We'll see you around. Bye.

03:52.950 --> 03:54.710
Are you okay?

03:54.745 --> 03:56.470
I'm fine. Fine.

03:57.340 --> 03:58.405
Let's talk about prom plans.

03:58.440 --> 04:01.470
We should probably ask Walt
if he wants to come with us also.

04:01.570 --> 04:04.120
Yeah. Yeah.
We'll make it a party.

04:04.155 --> 04:05.570
I like the sound of a party.

04:12.590 --> 04:13.490
Heading to the gym?

04:13.525 --> 04:14.450
Yep.

04:14.590 --> 04:15.710
Is that cologne?

04:16.850 --> 04:19.930
Yeah. Yeah.
Drakkar noir.

04:20.240 --> 04:21.839
You're wearing cologne to the gym?

04:22.950 --> 04:25.250
Thers a guy there
who smells really bad.

04:25.285 --> 04:26.395
serious kills me.

04:26.430 --> 04:27.825
I just do my best to survive.

04:27.860 --> 04:29.480
That's why you'll never
catch me at the gym.

04:29.490 --> 04:32.680
Working out-not for me
but I'm glad you're joying it.

04:32.715 --> 04:33.370
I am.

04:33.380 --> 04:34.725
After I take the meditation class

04:34.760 --> 04:36.840
I realize how important
it is for me to have an outlet.

04:36.875 --> 04:38.920
You know, some place
where I can real go and just...

04:39.970 --> 04:40.690
let it all out.

04:40.725 --> 04:41.850
Oh, god.

04:46.270 --> 04:47.360
That is...

04:47.950 --> 04:50.080
That is so much better than the gym.

04:50.780 --> 04:52.110
It better be.

04:53.580 --> 04:55.120
I'd like to think
i'm a little more fun

04:55.155 --> 04:56.860
than free weights.

04:59.400 --> 05:00.080
You're trying
to leave me already?

05:00.100 --> 05:02.080
We just finished.

05:02.370 --> 05:05.390
For the third time.

05:07.600 --> 05:10.050
As much as I'd love to
have you spend the night,

05:10.085 --> 05:11.630
it's getting late.

05:12.160 --> 05:14.440
I mean, the gym has to close
at some point, right?

05:14.475 --> 05:15.820
I don't want you kids
to get suspicious.

05:15.855 --> 05:17.330
No, you're right I should get going.

05:17.365 --> 05:18.940
Don't wanna get busted.

05:19.050 --> 05:20.340
No, you're right.

05:21.110 --> 05:23.110
We are like couple of horny teenagers

05:23.145 --> 05:24.725
trying to get a quickie in.

05:24.760 --> 05:27.440
I hope the difference
between teenager time and adult time

05:27.475 --> 05:30.140
is that...
I'm not too quick.

05:30.175 --> 05:31.485
You are just right.

05:31.520 --> 05:33.280
I wonder how long we can keep it up.

05:33.315 --> 05:35.360
Or how long we should.

05:35.370 --> 05:36.400
What do you mean?

05:36.680 --> 05:39.595
Well, I... as much as I like

05:39.630 --> 05:41.750
being the other woman
to your little women,

05:41.785 --> 05:44.512
I... I just wonder if maybe we should-

05:44.547 --> 05:47.240
- Tell our kids that we're datin?
- Yeah.

05:47.410 --> 05:50.630
My girls lost their mom
less than a year ago.

05:51.260 --> 05:53.640
I mean, all they have now
are memories of us,

05:54.060 --> 05:56.525
and I just don't want them to

05:56.560 --> 05:58.640
feel like I'm disrespecting
those memories.

06:00.180 --> 06:03.410
And while one person was focused
on honoring the past...

06:04.230 --> 06:05.925
Another was diving into it.

06:05.960 --> 06:08.300
I can't believe you are going
to Kyoto for the summer

06:08.335 --> 06:09.415
to learn to be a geisha.

06:09.450 --> 06:11.600
Darling, in order to
embrace being a modern woman,

06:11.610 --> 06:13.950
you have to know the ways
of the traditional woman.

06:14.020 --> 06:15.820
And I hear they really know
how to pleasure a man.

06:15.830 --> 06:18.085
That is a skill
that every woman should know.

06:18.120 --> 06:20.960
Why do I have a feeling
you'll be teaching them a thing or two?

06:20.970 --> 06:22.530
Because you know me so well.

06:22.980 --> 06:23.535
I'm gonna miss you.

06:23.570 --> 06:26.470
Oh, please,
you are gonna "all about Eve" me.

06:26.505 --> 06:27.902
By the time I get back in July,

06:27.937 --> 06:29.265
you will have taken over my job

06:29.300 --> 06:31.655
and ensconced yourself in my office.

06:31.690 --> 06:33.700
I'd settle for getting to use
that phone of yours.

06:33.735 --> 06:36.210
I'd rather you take my job.
Hide this.

06:36.270 --> 06:38.160
So you'll keep an eye
on everyone for me

06:38.170 --> 06:39.825
while I'm gone, be my spy?

06:39.860 --> 06:41.445
And answer the phones.

06:41.480 --> 06:43.830
I still don't know
where that silly receptionist went.

06:43.865 --> 06:45.102
You went to her good-bye party.

06:45.137 --> 06:46.305
She move back to Dallas, remember?

06:46.340 --> 06:49.290
Oh, right. I always forget people
who don't like the city.

06:49.325 --> 06:50.595
They're just not worth remembering.

06:50.630 --> 06:52.580
Thanks to her,
i get to work here all summer

06:52.615 --> 06:54.905
as a real full-time receptionist.

06:54.940 --> 06:57.240
Hello? "Interview" magazine.
How may I help you?

06:57.275 --> 06:59.092
We're not paying.
You know that, right?

06:59.127 --> 07:00.875
I know.
I think I'll end up losing money

07:00.910 --> 07:03.060
having to take the train every day,
but I don't care.

07:03.095 --> 07:03.695
It's worth it.

07:03.730 --> 07:06.160
Sweets, you should stay
at my loft while I'm gone.

07:06.195 --> 07:08.200
The neighborhood is so skunge.

07:08.235 --> 07:08.755
It would be great

07:08.790 --> 07:10.545
to have someone
look after the place for me.

07:10.580 --> 07:12.510
Somehow I don't think
my dad would be too psyched

07:12.545 --> 07:13.735
about skungee, but...

07:13.770 --> 07:16.130
Say it's a gorgeous downtown loft

07:16.140 --> 07:18.860
with oodles of space for you
and the gorgeous Walt.

07:18.895 --> 07:20.412
You could live there together.

07:20.447 --> 07:22.093
That is such a generous offer.

07:22.128 --> 07:23.705
But I don't think I'm really

07:23.740 --> 07:26.370
ready to abandon
Castlebury entirely this summer.

07:27.100 --> 07:28.810
Haven't given up on the hair god?

07:29.270 --> 07:31.920
Don't fret.
The viking obviously adores you.

07:31.955 --> 07:33.302
Why else would he come to Manhattan

07:33.337 --> 07:35.393
and hang with a bunch
of fabulous gays

07:35.428 --> 07:37.450
and the hags who love them
if he didn't?

07:37.680 --> 07:39.940
And while I wished I wasn't alone...

07:39.950 --> 07:41.980
Are you serious?
I can't believe that.

07:42.015 --> 07:43.940
It appeared my sister wasn't.

07:44.030 --> 07:45.060
I actually forgot we did that.

07:45.095 --> 07:46.190
So funny.

07:46.660 --> 07:48.190
Carrie, hey.

07:50.790 --> 07:52.470
Carrie, hey.

07:54.000 --> 08:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:02.380 --> 08:03.930
Hope it's okay I stopped by.

08:04.610 --> 08:05.465
Of course.

08:05.500 --> 08:07.630
So we should probably
head upstairs.

08:07.710 --> 08:08.395
Totally.

08:08.430 --> 08:09.220
You don't have to.

08:09.230 --> 08:10.950
Oh, we want to.

08:11.310 --> 08:12.770
Not be a buzz kill or anything,

08:12.805 --> 08:14.230
but you better leave the door open.

08:14.265 --> 08:16.090
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

08:17.390 --> 08:18.460
So, uh...

08:19.070 --> 08:20.845
- Nice bump into you again.
- The same.

08:20.880 --> 08:22.675
Kinda funny
we both like Bradshaw girls.

08:22.710 --> 08:24.470
I think it means
we have very good taste.

08:24.770 --> 08:27.820
Blah, blah, blah.
Let's get out of here or I'll leave.

08:32.450 --> 08:33.595
Well...

08:33.630 --> 08:35.330
Don't really know where to begin.

08:35.730 --> 08:38.110
How about with, "I'm happy to see you"?

08:38.480 --> 08:39.490
I am.

08:39.730 --> 08:40.905
But how do you even know Miller?

08:40.940 --> 08:43.059
Oh, we went to the same
private school for a bit.

08:43.095 --> 08:44.970
The one I got kicked out
of for pot smokin'.

08:45.005 --> 08:46.620
So, uh, Miller isn't in our grade?

08:46.630 --> 08:48.075
Actually a senior.

08:48.110 --> 08:49.800
So Dorrit's with someone
older than us?

08:49.835 --> 08:50.665
Miller's all right.

08:50.700 --> 08:53.100
He's super smart, but he doesn't really care
much about it.

08:53.135 --> 08:54.155
Or anything.

08:54.190 --> 08:55.485
And he's exactly Dorrit's type,

08:55.520 --> 08:57.370
and I don't mean that in a good way.

08:58.000 --> 08:59.240
Shs seems happy.

09:01.360 --> 09:02.410
She does.

09:04.310 --> 09:06.720
Wow, my sister's happy.

09:07.130 --> 09:08.090
It was strange to think

09:08.100 --> 09:09.960
my sister was happy and in love,

09:09.995 --> 09:11.120
and I wasn't.

09:12.120 --> 09:13.310
I miss you.

09:14.600 --> 09:16.100
And I'm sorry.

09:17.450 --> 09:18.610
Me, to.

09:18.920 --> 09:20.750
I'm sorry I let you break up
with me.

09:20.785 --> 09:21.625
I didn't want that.

09:21.660 --> 09:23.780
I'm sorry I said
it in the first place.

09:24.040 --> 09:26.165
I hate that everything I think, I say,

09:26.200 --> 09:28.255
even when it's not what I... want.

09:28.290 --> 09:30.020
And I hate that
I don't say what I think,

09:30.055 --> 09:30.565
even when I should.

09:30.600 --> 09:33.710
I hate that I feel so vulnerable
and then lash out at you.

09:33.745 --> 09:35.980
I hate that
you don't feel safe with me.

09:35.990 --> 09:37.700
I hate that I sabotage things
when they're good,

09:37.735 --> 09:40.160
because I think everything
good goes away.

09:40.210 --> 09:41.760
I hate that I grew up
around so much drama

09:41.795 --> 09:42.785
that I don't know any different.

09:42.820 --> 09:45.150
I hate that your parents
said that to you.

09:46.820 --> 09:48.130
You know what I don't hate?

09:48.680 --> 09:49.630
What?

09:50.380 --> 09:51.380
You.

09:52.340 --> 09:53.470
I love you.

09:54.710 --> 09:56.710
You couldn't possibly love me

09:57.050 --> 09:58.710
as much as I love you.

10:09.290 --> 10:11.350
I love you, Sebastian Kydd,

10:11.980 --> 10:14.430
so much, my heart hurts.

10:30.920 --> 10:32.500
Dorrit, stop.

10:32.870 --> 10:35.090
Why? My dad's not at home.

10:35.370 --> 10:37.475
Yeah, but your sister is.

10:37.510 --> 10:39.580
So? No time let her know.

10:42.390 --> 10:44.000
Why are you rushing this?

10:44.970 --> 10:46.860
I kinda just want get it over with.

10:47.220 --> 10:49.285
Is it because you'r scared
it's gonna hurt?

10:49.320 --> 10:53.030
Maybe. I just keep thinking
about it and thinking about it.

10:53.065 --> 10:55.887
If it'll hurt,
if I'll feel different afterward.

10:55.922 --> 10:58.710
I just don't wanna wondering anymore.
I wanna know.

10:59.000 --> 10:59.975
Even if it's bad.

11:00.010 --> 11:01.450
It's not gonna be bad.

11:01.980 --> 11:05.010
It might hurt,
and maybe you'll feel different.

11:05.045 --> 11:06.080
I don't know.

11:06.900 --> 11:10.760
But... one thing's for sure-
I will like you afterward.

11:12.020 --> 11:12.720
Promise?

11:12.730 --> 11:13.920
I promise.

11:14.660 --> 11:16.870
And I promise that
it's gonna be special.

11:18.000 --> 11:19.400
That's why I wanna wait.

11:24.910 --> 11:27.020
So you're not mad that
i'm going to prom with Sebastian?

11:27.055 --> 11:28.385
Of course not.
I'll be fine.

11:28.420 --> 11:30.380
Although I don't think he'll appreciate
your sparkly dress

11:30.390 --> 11:31.455
as much as I would.

11:31.490 --> 11:32.520
Uh, that may be true.

11:32.770 --> 11:34.760
But I bet he'll enjoy
getting you out of it.

11:34.770 --> 11:35.445
Mags!

11:35.480 --> 11:37.830
What? I'm right.
Walt, aren't I right?

11:37.865 --> 11:39.417
Ha ha! I'm going to say nothing.

11:39.452 --> 11:40.970
- Good choice.
- Ugh, please.

11:41.010 --> 11:44.230
Proms are for getting drunk,
getting laid, getting in fights.

11:44.490 --> 11:46.035
Well, I was going to ask you to prom,

11:46.070 --> 11:49.040
seeing as we're both solo,
but now... not so sure.

11:49.330 --> 11:50.400
Seriously?

11:51.420 --> 11:53.940
Well, prom is also
for dancing up a storm

11:53.975 --> 11:55.275
and being a really, really fun date.

11:55.310 --> 11:57.710
And since I don't expect
a steak dinner, a cheap one.

11:58.010 --> 11:59.300
It wouldn't be...

11:59.460 --> 12:01.550
Romantic?
Duh. We're way past that.

12:02.500 --> 12:04.890
But I like the idea
of you and me at prom.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.602
Yeah. Me, too.
For old times' sake.

12:06.637 --> 12:08.280
We could double
with Mouse and Eugene.

12:08.340 --> 12:09.065
Who's Eugene?

12:09.100 --> 12:10.970
Some loser Mouse's parents
are making her to go prom with.

12:11.005 --> 12:12.085
What about me and Sebastian?

12:12.120 --> 12:13.515
Why don't you guys
wanna double with us?

12:13.550 --> 12:16.140
Because you two
are gonna be all... lovey-dovey.

12:16.175 --> 12:17.817
We don't need to be a part of that.

12:17.852 --> 12:19.460
I'm gonna be lovey-dovey at prom.

12:20.020 --> 12:21.580
I'm so happy for you.

12:21.770 --> 12:23.525
Sebastian is such a great guy.

12:23.560 --> 12:25.280
- He is, isn't he?
- Totally.

12:25.290 --> 12:26.905
He knows you.
He wants to protect you.

12:26.940 --> 12:29.350
I wish I could meet a guy
who wants to protect me from stuff.

12:29.385 --> 12:30.710
What do you mean
protect me from stuff?

12:30.720 --> 12:32.990
Just he... he looks out for you.

12:33.025 --> 12:34.370
He wants you to be happy.

12:34.750 --> 12:36.210
Protects me from what?

12:36.400 --> 12:39.090
From-from...
the cold and-and stuff.

12:39.180 --> 12:41.270
Like w-when he gave you
his jacket.

12:41.960 --> 12:42.855
What?

12:42.890 --> 12:44.850
Mags, your eyes just darted in,
like, three directions.

12:44.885 --> 12:46.700
I know you're hiding
something from me.

12:48.570 --> 12:49.880
Are you guys hiding
something from me?

12:49.915 --> 12:52.130
No, I'm not. I swear.

12:53.540 --> 12:54.055
Mags?

12:54.090 --> 12:55.910
Okay, it's nothing, really.
It's...

12:55.945 --> 12:57.730
Well, if it's nothing,
just say it.

12:58.310 --> 13:00.860
You better say it.
She's not gonna stop until you do.

13:00.895 --> 13:03.510
Ugh. It-it's really
not a big deal.

13:03.630 --> 13:06.240
When Sebastian and I
met up to get my fake I.D.-

13:06.275 --> 13:08.170
Which is awesome, by the way-

13:08.205 --> 13:10.270
Uh, we saw your dad.

13:10.305 --> 13:11.270
Okay.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.350
With a lady.

13:13.810 --> 13:15.100
Like a date?

13:15.340 --> 13:16.615
I think so.
It-it might have been.

13:16.650 --> 13:18.920
It was-it was hard to tell
'cause it was kinda dark.

13:19.770 --> 13:21.450
It was probably a date.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.300
Sebastian just thought that...

13:23.550 --> 13:25.720
I shouldn't know about my dad?

13:25.920 --> 13:27.320
He wanted to protect you.

13:27.770 --> 13:29.105
You did it to protect me?

13:29.140 --> 13:30.710
Yeah. I thought you'd be upset.

13:30.745 --> 13:32.340
I am, at you.

13:32.410 --> 13:35.000
How could you keep
something like this from me?

13:35.035 --> 13:37.277
Because I knew you'd be upset,
which you are.

13:37.312 --> 13:39.520
I would never keep
something like this from you

13:39.555 --> 13:40.945
if I had seen your mom
with someone.

13:40.980 --> 13:43.410
Carrie, I've seen my mom
with lots of "someones. "

13:43.460 --> 13:44.765
And my dad, for that matter.

13:44.800 --> 13:46.525
So it wouldn't really
be much of a shock to me.

13:46.560 --> 13:48.215
But I figured hearing your dad
was making out

13:48.250 --> 13:51.080
like some horny teenager
in his car would bum you out.

13:52.800 --> 13:55.390
I thought they were just at dinner.

13:56.140 --> 13:57.930
I figured Maggie
told you everything.

13:59.360 --> 14:00.835
No, not everything,

14:00.870 --> 14:04.180
But now I have every last
visual in my head.

14:04.570 --> 14:05.735
how could he move on already?

14:05.770 --> 14:07.195
This is why I didn't want to tell you.

14:07.230 --> 14:08.585
Because you thought
i couldn't handle it.

14:08.620 --> 14:11.030
Because I know it's hard to see
your parents as people.

14:11.065 --> 14:13.430
I have to deal with it all the time.
I get it.

14:13.440 --> 14:15.620
It'd be easier not to have to
think of your dad that way.

14:15.655 --> 14:18.220
Sebastian, it's been less than a year.

14:18.560 --> 14:20.315
My parents had a real love affair.

14:20.350 --> 14:23.170
You-you don't just move on
from that like it was nothing.

14:23.205 --> 14:24.320
I don't think that's what he's doing.

14:24.355 --> 14:25.145
You wouldn't understand.

14:25.180 --> 14:27.510
Unlike your parents,
mine had a good marriage.

14:28.290 --> 14:29.990
We have very different histories.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.770
Well, maybe we're just too different.

14:34.090 --> 14:35.610
You know, where we come from,

14:36.140 --> 14:38.840
How we were raised,
how we see the world.

14:39.330 --> 14:40.340
Just...

14:41.250 --> 14:43.540
No matter what,
it seems like we end up here.

14:43.575 --> 14:45.632
Because you wanna overthink
every moment.

14:45.667 --> 14:47.690
Or because you don't want to
think at all.

14:48.150 --> 14:51.130
I mean, you smoke pot
with Donna to let loose.

14:51.160 --> 14:52.595
You got drunk at that book party

14:52.630 --> 14:54.460
because you were upset
about your mom.

14:54.790 --> 14:56.380
I'm trying to cope, okay?

14:56.415 --> 14:58.100
So am I, every day.

14:58.950 --> 15:02.620
Look, I know it's complicated for us.
Between us.

15:02.710 --> 15:04.880
But that doesn't mean
it's not worth it.

15:04.980 --> 15:06.280
Maybe it does.

15:07.970 --> 15:11.840
I- I love you so much,
my heart hurts.

15:13.070 --> 15:15.290
Is that what love
is supposed to feel like?

15:15.340 --> 15:16.850
Like pain?

15:18.110 --> 15:19.270
I... I don't know.

15:19.820 --> 15:21.670
I don't want to live in pain.

15:22.670 --> 15:24.060
Or love that way.

15:26.430 --> 15:28.350
I'm sorry, Sebastian.

15:35.280 --> 15:36.820
Carrie.
Carrie, are you okay?

15:37.680 --> 15:39.210
Why didn't you tell me?

15:39.420 --> 15:41.800
You guys didn't have
any right to keep this from me.

15:41.810 --> 15:43.035
You're right, totally.

15:43.070 --> 15:45.360
What happened with you and Sebastian?
Do you wanna talk or...

15:45.395 --> 15:46.400
No.

15:46.740 --> 15:49.190
For once, I do not want to talk at all.

15:49.225 --> 15:51.130
I wanna be by myself, okay?

15:55.940 --> 15:57.525
I am so sorry. I had no-

15:57.560 --> 15:59.610
No idea you'd wreck
my chances with Carrie?

15:59.645 --> 16:00.725
It j-it just slipped out.

16:00.760 --> 16:02.190
You just happened to blurt out

16:02.200 --> 16:04.350
the one thing we agreed
not to tell Carrie?

16:05.010 --> 16:06.890
Yeah, I gotta wonder. Are you one
of those girls who's just jealous

16:06.925 --> 16:08.202
when her friends are with someone.

16:08.237 --> 16:09.480
No! I was happy for you and Carrie!

16:09.490 --> 16:11.810
I mean, clearly you can't find
happiness with a guy.

16:12.300 --> 16:13.530
That-that's not true.

16:14.370 --> 16:15.750
Walt and I were happy.

16:17.120 --> 16:18.550
Okay. Okay, fine.

16:19.340 --> 16:21.780
Fine. Um, it sucks...

16:22.400 --> 16:24.500
That nothing ever works out
for me sucks.

16:25.200 --> 16:27.090
But I would never sabotage
Carrie's happiness.

16:27.125 --> 16:29.440
I- just wanna find my own.

16:30.890 --> 16:32.300
I don't know what I'm doing wrong.

16:34.310 --> 16:36.260
You're not doing anything wrong.

16:36.340 --> 16:38.260
Then why doesn't anybody
wanna be with me?

16:39.390 --> 16:41.670
It must be me.
Is-is something wrong with me?

16:43.420 --> 16:45.575
I- I-I'm gonna do you a favor,

16:45.610 --> 16:48.920
Because no one else will tell you the truth,
and you deserve to know.

16:51.310 --> 16:54.450
Walt was never gonna love you
in any real way.

16:54.810 --> 16:55.810
Ever.

16:56.090 --> 16:57.450
I don't understand.

16:58.140 --> 16:59.300
Think about it.

17:01.240 --> 17:03.030
I don't think Walt likes girls.

17:05.630 --> 17:07.770
I was really excited
about going to the prom.

17:07.805 --> 17:09.335
Why don't you come with me
and Maggie?

17:09.369 --> 17:11.670
We're going as friends anyway.
There she is.

17:13.010 --> 17:14.060
Is it true?

17:14.220 --> 17:15.210
What?

17:16.079 --> 17:17.800
Are you... gay?

17:19.339 --> 17:20.390
Are you?

17:22.030 --> 17:23.609
You're homo, aren't you?

17:23.645 --> 17:25.190
Mags, don't do this.

17:25.224 --> 17:26.305
Did you know?

17:26.339 --> 17:28.800
Was everyone just hiding this
from me and laughing at me?

17:28.835 --> 17:29.725
No.

17:29.760 --> 17:32.810
You have some nerve,
talking to me about secrets,

17:32.845 --> 17:34.370
when all along you knew this.

17:34.405 --> 17:35.295
Mags, stop.

17:35.330 --> 17:37.650
Why you think you're
the only person in the world

17:37.685 --> 17:38.320
that deserves the truth?

17:38.355 --> 17:39.272
I don't.

17:39.307 --> 17:40.190
Mags

17:41.330 --> 17:42.650
You deserve the truth.

17:42.780 --> 17:44.605
If.. maybe we could
go somewhere to talk?

17:44.640 --> 17:46.165
Apparently I didn't deserve
the truth

17:46.200 --> 17:47.655
when you wouldn't
have sex with me

17:47.690 --> 17:49.385
and you made me feel
like crap about myself.

17:49.420 --> 17:51.140
You made me feel
like something was wrong with me

17:51.175 --> 17:53.530
when actually something's
wrong with you.

17:54.350 --> 17:55.400
I can't believe
i ever loved you.

17:55.435 --> 17:56.790
You make me sick.

18:13.880 --> 18:16.320
"Heave"?
More like "heaven help us. "

18:16.380 --> 18:18.295
Just say it.
It's gonna be hell...

18:18.330 --> 18:20.110
which is why
i'm so happy we're not going.

18:20.145 --> 18:21.850
I am so sorry, Walt

18:21.970 --> 18:23.175
For what? It's not your fault.

18:23.210 --> 18:26.210
Well, it kind of is.
Not that I ever said anything to him,

18:26.245 --> 18:28.330
but it was Sebastian
who told Maggie.

18:28.380 --> 18:30.320
I'm not mad at him.
You shouldn't be either.

18:30.355 --> 18:31.880
I can still be mad at him.

18:31.900 --> 18:34.120
For your own stuff,
but not for me, okay?

18:35.950 --> 18:37.740
So I'm off to the gym.

18:38.800 --> 18:40.135
You smell nice.

18:40.170 --> 18:41.435
Uh... sure.

18:41.470 --> 18:44.040
Yeah. So I see you decided
to go to prom.

18:44.075 --> 18:44.545
That's great.

18:44.580 --> 18:47.140
No. Actually, Walt and I
are heading into the city.

18:47.175 --> 18:48.700
A little going-away party for Larissa.

18:48.710 --> 18:51.980
Well, I hope you guy don't regret
missing your junior prom.

18:52.015 --> 18:55.250
- I don't think we're gonna regret that choice.
- Definily no.

18:55.530 --> 18:57.120
So what time do you think
you'll be home tonight?

18:57.155 --> 18:58.620
Can I talk to you about that?

18:58.850 --> 19:01.610
I was hoping I could sleep
over at Larissa's tonight.

19:01.645 --> 19:03.280
She's leaving for Kyoto
tomorrow evening,

19:03.315 --> 19:04.542
And I was gonna help her pack.

19:04.577 --> 19:05.735
Uh... I don't know, Carrie.

19:05.770 --> 19:07.295
Walt would stay, too,
so I'd have someone

19:07.330 --> 19:08.820
to take the train back
with in the morning.

19:08.855 --> 19:10.500
Are you and Walt...
Dating?

19:10.535 --> 19:12.167
What? N-no.

19:12.202 --> 19:13.800
No. Never.

19:13.810 --> 19:15.475
Carrie, never say never.

19:15.510 --> 19:18.295
Sometimes friendships
have a way of changing.

19:18.330 --> 19:20.960
Dad, trust me on this one.
That will never happen.

19:20.995 --> 19:22.200
If you say so.

19:22.260 --> 19:23.650
I definitely say so.

19:24.090 --> 19:26.300
So is it all right if we stay?

19:26.710 --> 19:28.650
Sure.
Yeah, it's okay.

19:29.390 --> 19:30.460
You won't,

19:30.470 --> 19:32.600
uh, be lonely
without me and Dorrit here?

19:32.610 --> 19:33.470
Since she has a sleepover?

19:33.480 --> 19:34.235
I'll be fine.

19:34.270 --> 19:35.490
You know, when I get back
from the gym,

19:35.525 --> 19:37.105
I'm so tired, I just crash anyway.

19:37.140 --> 19:39.660
That gym really seems
all-consuming for you.

19:39.695 --> 19:41.130
I've been enjoying myself.

19:41.250 --> 19:42.410
That's great.

19:43.310 --> 19:46.480
But you've really been spending
a lot of time there.

19:46.560 --> 19:48.040
And at night, at dinnertime,

19:48.050 --> 19:50.210
which I like to think
it's family time, not gym time.

19:50.245 --> 19:51.810
Maybe you should
spend more time with us.

19:51.845 --> 19:54.950
Me and Dorrit...
We need you.

19:57.900 --> 20:00.040
Got it. Right.

20:00.120 --> 20:01.720
Totally hear you, Carrie.

20:01.840 --> 20:04.680
And it's not like
the gym won't understand.

20:05.030 --> 20:06.290
It's just a gym.

20:06.690 --> 20:07.770
Good.

20:11.180 --> 20:12.640
Can I open them yet?

20:12.870 --> 20:13.900
Not yet.

20:14.540 --> 20:15.730
Now?

20:16.140 --> 20:17.100
Now.

20:34.170 --> 20:35.470
Is this for me?

20:35.910 --> 20:37.780
This is why I wanted us to wait.

20:38.010 --> 20:40.030
I wanted it to be perfect for us.

20:40.510 --> 20:41.640
For you.

20:51.780 --> 20:53.490
From one unhappy girl

20:53.920 --> 20:55.195
to another...

20:55.230 --> 20:56.760
So you know Dorrit?

20:57.520 --> 20:59.350
Carrie's sister?
Sure.

20:59.550 --> 21:00.990
She's in my class.

21:01.550 --> 21:02.890
Cool.

21:03.950 --> 21:05.590
We'll both be at
the high school next year.

21:05.625 --> 21:06.750
Awesome.

21:07.270 --> 21:09.700
I don't know what's
taking my dad so long.

21:09.900 --> 21:12.100
I'm sorry you have to go
with me to your prom

21:12.135 --> 21:14.500
and that my mom has to drive us.

21:14.870 --> 21:16.130
What?

21:16.360 --> 21:17.145
I'm sorry. Just-

21:17.180 --> 21:20.000
I can't believe this
is my junior prom.

21:20.560 --> 21:21.585
No offense.

21:21.620 --> 21:24.510
I would rather be home playing
"Dungeons & Dragons. "

21:24.545 --> 21:25.565
No offense.

21:25.600 --> 21:26.505
It's so annoying

21:26.540 --> 21:29.480
my parents only want me to be
with someone who's chinese,

21:29.515 --> 21:30.925
even if she's too old for me.

21:30.960 --> 21:34.710
I know! And all because
our parents are Chinese royalty.

21:34.745 --> 21:35.865
We're not royalty.

21:35.900 --> 21:38.740
Of course we are,
from the Qing Dynasty.

21:38.910 --> 21:41.530
No. Our parents are from
the same farming village.

21:41.540 --> 21:45.550
We're, like, third cousins or something,
making this date even weirder.

21:45.585 --> 21:47.427
Well, I just did my family tree.

21:47.462 --> 21:49.270
- For a school project? - For fun.

21:49.650 --> 21:50.950
I like you, Eugene.

21:50.960 --> 21:53.385
And we come from a long line
of peasants and farmers.

21:53.420 --> 21:56.540
- Are you sure?
- A thousand years of hard labor and back-breaking work.

21:56.575 --> 21:57.695
That cannot be.

21:57.730 --> 21:59.500
I can bring over the tree if you like.

21:59.535 --> 22:00.640
It's very detailed.

22:00.675 --> 22:01.800
So...

22:02.220 --> 22:04.665
All along, I've played
by my parents' rules

22:04.700 --> 22:07.110
and respected their
traditions and for what?

22:07.640 --> 22:10.580
To protect the lineage of peasants?

22:11.310 --> 22:13.285
And I said "No"
to going to the prom

22:13.320 --> 22:15.260
with my really,
really hot boyfriend

22:15.295 --> 22:15.815
to please my parents,

22:15.850 --> 22:19.100
when I am the best thing
that's ever happened in this family.

22:19.135 --> 22:20.980
In a nutshell?
Yes.

22:27.330 --> 22:30.710
And after this little soiree,
it's off to danceteria.

22:30.910 --> 22:32.770
It's gonna be marvous.

22:35.460 --> 22:36.745
I'm proud of you, Walt.

22:36.780 --> 22:39.130
Even acknowledging
you're gay is huge.

22:40.010 --> 22:41.510
I'm not telling many people.

22:41.640 --> 22:44.600
Mm. Well, you're taking
baby steps out of the closet,

22:44.635 --> 22:45.720
and that's a big deal.

22:45.980 --> 22:47.455
I just wish I didn't feel like

22:47.490 --> 22:49.325
I ran out and forgot
to put clothes on.

22:49.360 --> 22:51.160
Well, you'll feel
like that for a while.

22:51.170 --> 22:53.225
Just don't beat yourself up
if there's moments

22:53.260 --> 22:56.070
when you wanna run back in
and never come back out again.

22:57.540 --> 22:58.710
I knew this would be hard for me.

22:58.745 --> 23:00.720
I- I just feel awful

23:00.880 --> 23:02.930
that I dragged Maggie through it, too.

23:03.540 --> 23:06.490
If I'd just been honest
with myself earlier...

23:06.525 --> 23:08.375
Walt, we don't live in a world

23:08.410 --> 23:10.480
where people are that accepting of us.

23:10.510 --> 23:12.325
I mean, there's pockets
like New York,

23:12.360 --> 23:14.140
but then there's also places like...

23:14.175 --> 23:14.855
Castlebury

23:14.890 --> 23:16.540
Exactly.
Where being honest

23:16.575 --> 23:18.155
often means being shunned.

23:18.190 --> 23:19.860
Did your friends
from home accept it?

23:19.880 --> 23:21.630
Some did. Some didn't.

23:21.650 --> 23:24.100
My best friend Ritchie
acted like I'd lied to him.

23:24.135 --> 23:25.655
Like somehow
our camping trips growing up

23:25.690 --> 23:28.120
had been an excuse for me
to get into a tent with him.

23:28.155 --> 23:30.250
So what happened?
Are you friends still?

23:30.720 --> 23:31.770
No.

23:32.270 --> 23:34.420
He could never see me
in the same light again.

23:34.640 --> 23:35.725
So be prepared.

23:35.760 --> 23:37.830
You know you're not
just taking on a new future.

23:37.865 --> 23:40.550
In a way, you're also creating
a new past.

23:43.950 --> 23:45.360
I knew you weren't ready.

23:46.400 --> 23:48.340
You don't have anything
to prove to me.

23:48.700 --> 23:50.100
All right, I don't mind waiting.

23:50.135 --> 23:51.215
But I am ready.

23:51.250 --> 23:53.310
You burst out into tears.

23:53.340 --> 23:55.260
That doesn't feel like
a good thing.

23:56.870 --> 23:59.690
When my mom died, I didn't cry...

24:00.400 --> 24:01.670
Once.

24:02.400 --> 24:05.230
I think because, in a way,
i've been numb ever since.

24:06.540 --> 24:07.990
But not tonight.

24:08.780 --> 24:12.350
I felt everything. I felt happy.

24:12.640 --> 24:15.360
So happy I just
couldn't handle it for a second.

24:16.650 --> 24:18.040
But I'm ready.

24:19.110 --> 24:20.870
To feel erything.

24:38.720 --> 24:41.235
Well, well, well,
if it isn't Sebastian Kydd.

24:41.270 --> 24:43.750
Oh, look. It's the girl
who screwed up my life.

24:43.785 --> 24:45.870
Same can be said of you for me.

24:45.950 --> 24:46.915
Wanna sit?

24:46.950 --> 24:48.670
Not really,
but I could use a drink.

24:48.780 --> 24:50.100
What do you want?
I'm buying.

24:50.135 --> 24:51.490
You bet you are.

24:51.800 --> 24:54.105
Ohh. That's a shame, darling.

24:54.140 --> 24:57.370
The hair god actually
seemed worth all the work.

24:57.420 --> 24:59.020
It's just got too complicated.

24:59.120 --> 25:01.120
Too many fights.

25:01.360 --> 25:02.665
How hard is it to be happy?

25:02.700 --> 25:03.970
Oh. It's near to impossible.

25:04.005 --> 25:05.465
Well, people are happy.

25:05.500 --> 25:07.725
Ohmm, for, like, one second.

25:07.760 --> 25:09.950
Blowing out birthday candles.

25:09.985 --> 25:12.130
Petting a... panda.

25:12.200 --> 25:14.750
Those are moments of joy,
but there is a difference.

25:14.810 --> 25:16.950
A good relationship is hard work.

25:16.985 --> 25:18.332
Practically slave larbor.

25:18.367 --> 25:19.645
Do you think I'm stupid

25:19.680 --> 25:21.010
for wanting to be happy
with someone?

25:21.045 --> 25:22.450
Oh, an absolute dumbbell.

25:22.750 --> 25:24.240
Look, people...

25:24.340 --> 25:27.380
Well, people like us-
we're always restless.

25:27.940 --> 25:29.620
So we're a little bit unhappy.

25:29.830 --> 25:31.315
Being with someone doesn't change that.

25:31.350 --> 25:33.650
It just makes it that
much more complicated.

25:33.670 --> 25:35.390
Maybe I just want something simple.

25:35.400 --> 25:37.290
Simple is some nice boy who is dull

25:37.325 --> 25:38.995
and doesn't challenge you.

25:39.030 --> 25:41.770
I can just see you bored out
of your mind in the suburbs.

25:41.805 --> 25:43.250
You'd kill yourself.

25:43.320 --> 25:44.440
I'll kill you.

25:45.030 --> 25:46.880
But I think I want that.

25:47.190 --> 25:49.645
When imagine my future,
i'm married,

25:49.680 --> 25:51.990
living in a house
with my garden and my kids.

25:52.030 --> 25:53.760
That is not your life,
Carrie Bradshaw.

25:53.795 --> 25:54.745
That is your mother's.

25:54.780 --> 25:57.370
Well, there's nothing wrong
with wanting what my parents had.

25:58.260 --> 26:00.470
Let me tell you a little bit
about the tribe I'm from.

26:01.090 --> 26:02.430
I'm... sorry. What?

26:02.500 --> 26:04.830
My father was the king of our tribe.

26:04.865 --> 26:06.080
I'm from Ghana

26:06.310 --> 26:10.240
And I was supposed to be married
to my mother's second cousin

26:10.275 --> 26:12.450
and become the wife
of the next ruler.

26:13.740 --> 26:15.495
I was 14 when I ran away.

26:15.530 --> 26:18.400
There was no way that these hips
were bearing children

26:18.435 --> 26:21.270
or that I'd be carrying water
in a jar on my head.

26:21.600 --> 26:23.230
How did you get
from there to here?

26:23.250 --> 26:24.650
With a lot of spunk...

26:24.810 --> 26:27.405
And a very handsome British lord
as a sugar daddy

26:27.440 --> 26:30.000
to look after me
until I could stand ony own.

26:30.090 --> 26:31.075
I never looked back.

26:31.110 --> 26:33.190
But you know what I took
from my old life?

26:33.630 --> 26:34.625
No.

26:34.660 --> 26:36.790
That I the daughter of a king,

26:37.080 --> 26:38.920
which makes me a princess!

26:39.690 --> 26:41.010
You certainly are.

26:41.900 --> 26:45.310
It is okay to love the things
that your parents give you.

26:45.410 --> 26:46.295
Treasure them.

26:46.330 --> 26:48.830
But you have to remember that
you are not your parents.

26:49.290 --> 26:51.160
You are you, Carrie Bradshaw.

26:52.060 --> 26:54.680
But what if me doesn't end up
with a white picket fence

26:54.715 --> 26:55.870
and a station wagon?

26:55.930 --> 26:59.150
There are millions of girls
out there who will marry a nice boy

26:59.185 --> 27:01.800
and drive one
those station wagon thingys.

27:01.810 --> 27:03.490
But you, you.

27:04.050 --> 27:05.595
You will never be satisfied

27:05.630 --> 27:08.380
that a man who sits at home
and asks you what'for dinner.

27:08.415 --> 27:10.005
- Takeout. - Exactly.

27:10.040 --> 27:12.180
You want a man who gets that
and gets you.

27:12.570 --> 27:13.920
Does Sebastian?

27:13.955 --> 27:15.270
He challenges me,

27:15.750 --> 27:17.320
makes me look at myself.

27:17.710 --> 27:19.880
I'm madly in love with him.

27:20.230 --> 27:22.400
Mad is wonderful!

27:22.750 --> 27:23.610
I better get out of here.

27:23.645 --> 27:25.230
Yes, you should.

27:27.010 --> 27:28.070
Have a great trip.

27:28.105 --> 27:29.130
Why, thank you.

27:31.610 --> 27:33.340
Hey, I never had a chance.

27:34.280 --> 27:35.995
There's-the's no money
to go college.

27:36.030 --> 27:38.590
I'm attracted to guys
who don't even like me.

27:39.200 --> 27:41.420
My own parents don't even think
i'll amount to anything.

27:41.455 --> 27:43.700
I'm probably gonna end up
a loser waitress

27:43.735 --> 27:45.010
at this loser bar.

27:46.540 --> 27:47.660
No offense.

27:49.850 --> 27:50.980
I'm sorry.

27:51.330 --> 27:53.240
Oh, that my life
is such a disaster?

27:53.280 --> 27:55.085
No, if I hadn't told you
about Walt,

27:55.120 --> 27:57.290
you'd be at the prom,
having a good time.

27:57.420 --> 27:58.835
Well, same for you,

27:58.870 --> 28:00.900
if I hadn'been all blabbermouy.

28:03.220 --> 28:04.240
Here's to...

28:04.610 --> 28:06.610
two loose-lip losers

28:06.650 --> 28:08.270
who created their own messes.

28:09.220 --> 28:10.950
Here's to being alone.

28:16.210 --> 28:17.840
I don't want to be alone tonight.

28:45.230 --> 28:47.010
Can I come in?

28:47.170 --> 28:48.940
Sure. Of course.

28:52.180 --> 28:53.850
Um... are you all right?

28:55.120 --> 28:57.640
Yeah. I'm more than all right.
I'm happy.

28:58.170 --> 29:00.070
Oh, good. I'm glad.

29:00.100 --> 29:01.835
I like the idea
of you being happy.

29:01.870 --> 29:05.150
I like the idea of being happy...
with you...

29:06.170 --> 29:07.700
and being unhappy with you.

29:07.710 --> 29:09.600
I lii-I like the idea
of being with you...

29:09.635 --> 29:11.655
Carrie, I-I have to say something.

29:11.690 --> 29:13.900
Don't. I know it's not going
to be easy.

29:13.935 --> 29:15.640
It never is with us.

29:15.880 --> 29:17.370
But I don't care.

29:17.810 --> 29:19.740
All I care about
is that we're together.

29:28.210 --> 29:32.720
I can't believe we get to spend
the whole night together.

29:33.810 --> 29:34.880
Yeah.

29:35.600 --> 29:37.155
Would you rather not?

29:37.190 --> 29:38.820
You're worried we might get caught.

29:38.855 --> 29:40.450
I'm worried that we already have.

29:43.680 --> 29:45.210
I think Carrie knows.

29:49.360 --> 29:51.370
Maybe this is a good thing.

29:52.170 --> 29:54.560
We wouldn't have to sneak
around anymore,

29:54.670 --> 29:57.750
and we could see what this is
maybe out in the open.

29:57.930 --> 29:59.920
I don't think she's ready
for me to date.

29:59.955 --> 30:01.910
- Did she say that?
- She didn't have to.

30:01.930 --> 30:03.275
I know my daughter,

30:03.310 --> 30:04.840
and she is not a selfish kid.

30:06.130 --> 30:07.700
If she's not ready..

30:09.140 --> 30:11.020
maybe it's just not time

30:12.320 --> 30:14.130
But maybe in a few months?

30:14.730 --> 30:16.810
When things have died down
a little bit?

30:23.260 --> 30:25.920
Can you at least...
stay tonight?

30:25.955 --> 30:28.580
That would make me very happy.

30:36.310 --> 30:37.320
What?

30:38.050 --> 30:39.390
I am so lucky.

30:39.940 --> 30:41.330
We both are.

30:42.130 --> 30:44.080
I wanna have sex with you.

30:45.630 --> 30:47.010
I want that, too.

30:47.045 --> 30:48.422
But when it happens,

30:48.457 --> 30:49.800
I want it to be perfect.

30:49.980 --> 30:51.110
It will be.

30:52.360 --> 30:54.490
I just wanna lie here tonight
with youn my arms.

30:54.525 --> 30:55.640
Is that alright?

31:04.340 --> 31:06.230
I've been looking for you everywhere.

31:07.040 --> 31:09.530
- How was the prom?
- I didn't go.

31:09.720 --> 31:11.400
Well, I went by to see if you
were there, but you weren't,

31:11.435 --> 31:14.090
so I stopped by your house,
the basketball courts.

31:14.125 --> 31:15.390
Well, you get the point.

31:15.430 --> 31:16.630
I don'understand.

31:16.730 --> 31:18.700
What happened to your date Eugene?

31:18.860 --> 31:21.650
I didn wanna go to the prom
with some geek in braces.

31:22.510 --> 31:25.490
I wanna go to the prom
with my hot geek boyfriend,

31:25.580 --> 31:27.450
which is exactly
what I told my parents.

31:27.485 --> 31:28.980
You told your parents about me?

31:30.090 --> 31:32.070
And how'd it go?

31:32.130 --> 31:34.600
Well, they're going to kill me.

31:35.120 --> 31:37.050
But I'll worry about that
another day.

31:37.200 --> 31:38.430
Tonight...

31:41.170 --> 31:43.580
I wanna dance with my boyfriend

31:43.630 --> 31:45.140
on prom night.

32:55.090 --> 32:56.460
I was happy..

32:57.410 --> 32:58.580
Hello?

32:59.400 --> 33:00.510
I'm home.

33:01.060 --> 33:02.210
And alone.

33:05.910 --> 33:07.090
Mags.

33:09.490 --> 33:11.000
Is everything ok?

33:13.420 --> 33:14.795
Larissa's gonna shame us

33:14.830 --> 33:16.230
for leaving the club so early.

33:16.740 --> 33:18.740
It's 7:30 a. m.

33:19.250 --> 33:21.390
In Larissa's world,
the party just began.

33:21.910 --> 33:24.790
Oh! I love this city.

33:24.980 --> 33:26.350
We're coming home
from a night of clubbing,

33:26.385 --> 33:28.070
and that guy's just starting s day.

33:28.100 --> 33:29.750
There's room here for everything.

33:29.850 --> 33:32.000
It's pretty amazing to know

33:32.035 --> 33:34.150
the city exists for all of us.

33:34.510 --> 33:35.990
Makes me feel safe.

33:36.090 --> 33:37.470
You are safe, Walt.

33:46.610 --> 33:48.200
I- I can't, Walt.

33:48.750 --> 33:50.700
Oh. Are you... not-

33:50.710 --> 33:53.950
No, it's not that
i don't want to. I can't.

33:53.985 --> 33:54.850
You're 17.

33:54.940 --> 33:57.140
I- I feel like I'd be taking
advange of you.

33:57.175 --> 33:58.425
I'm old enough to know what I want.

33:58.460 --> 34:01.220
And when you're not jailbait,
i'll want that, too.

34:01.390 --> 34:03.300
I turn 18 at the end
of the summer.

34:03.380 --> 34:05.050
I will be counting the days.

34:05.820 --> 34:06.685
So now what?

34:06.720 --> 34:08.010
Now we're friends.

34:08.070 --> 34:09.065
Friends?

34:09.100 --> 34:10.780
Being friends will be fun.

34:10.900 --> 34:12.850
The end of the summer feels
a long way away.

34:12.920 --> 34:14.350
Summer will fly by,

34:14.429 --> 34:16.800
plus my roommate Stanford
is a party promoter.

34:16.889 --> 34:18.770
He'll get us into the hottest clubs.

34:19.469 --> 34:20.909
That does sound like fun.

34:21.449 --> 34:22.920
And it was nothing.

34:23.350 --> 34:24.710
We-we both-
we both realized...

34:24.745 --> 34:26.070
that we knew that it was wrong

34:26.239 --> 34:27.469
and it was nothing.

34:27.639 --> 34:29.850
You already said that... twice

34:30.300 --> 34:31.405
I know you're not with him anymore,

34:31.440 --> 34:33.375
but... I just wanted
to be honest with you.

34:33.409 --> 34:35.310
I wouldn't wanna hide anything
from you.

34:35.550 --> 34:37.000
You don't deserve that.

34:37.800 --> 34:40.550
I- I didn't even know if i should
come over here and tell you.

34:40.739 --> 34:43.060
I was up all night
thinking and crying.

34:43.094 --> 34:44.150
I just feel so awful.

34:44.185 --> 34:45.455
Like as if I-

34:45.489 --> 34:48.909
I don'know why I do these things
before I think.

34:49.770 --> 34:51.790
I guess I just feel so alone

34:51.830 --> 34:52.790
and so scared.

34:52.800 --> 34:55.670
And all of this has just been way
too much for me,

34:55.690 --> 34:56.760
and-and I don't know why these things
keep happening to me,

34:56.795 --> 34:58.290
- but i-
- Stop.

34:59.340 --> 35:01.410
You're not the victim here.

35:01.840 --> 35:02.705
I know. I know.

35:02.740 --> 35:04.000
I'm not trying to make it about me.

35:04.030 --> 35:07.580
It's alway about you.
Always.

35:08.760 --> 35:10.920
Ever since we were in kindergarten.

35:11.040 --> 35:12.940
Your need for attention,

35:13.310 --> 35:14.655
to make drama

35:14.690 --> 35:16.480
so that you can be
at the center of it,

35:16.730 --> 35:20.680
and never, not once,
have I judged you.

35:20.715 --> 35:22.450
I didn't make Walt gay.

35:23.040 --> 35:23.975
Okay?
And I'm sorry

35:24.010 --> 35:26.730
that I-I don't have parents
that believe in me like you do.

35:26.740 --> 35:27.930
Did.

35:27.990 --> 35:29.535
I can't help
what I've been through.

35:29.570 --> 35:31.850
You're blaming your past
and what you've been through

35:31.885 --> 35:33.310
for what you did to me.

35:34.140 --> 35:35.395
You're not even blaming it.

35:35.430 --> 35:37.640
You're excusing
your behavior with it.

35:38.400 --> 35:40.960
You know, Mags,
we've all been through stuff.

35:41.510 --> 35:42.900
Hard stuff.

35:44.050 --> 35:46.990
Stuff that has made us
make choices we might regret.

35:48.210 --> 35:50.930
And now you're going to have
to live with that.

35:51.080 --> 35:54.410
I will make it up to you.
I swear.

35:56.220 --> 35:58.400
We've been friends for a long time.

35:58.435 --> 36:00.590
I know. That means something.

36:00.610 --> 36:03.220
Maybe all it means that
it's been a long time,

36:03.640 --> 36:06.450
because it certainly doesn't
mean you're a good friend.

36:08.240 --> 36:09.760
You should go.

36:51.930 --> 36:53.010
Carrie.

36:53.490 --> 36:54.860
Are you okay?

36:54.895 --> 36:56.277
I don't think so.

36:56.312 --> 36:57.660
Did something happen?

36:58.120 --> 36:59.420
Something awful.

36:59.490 --> 37:01.030
With Sebastian?

37:04.260 --> 37:05.570
I'm sorry.

37:06.870 --> 37:08.080
Thanks.

37:11.970 --> 37:13.670
So how was Audrey's?

37:13.750 --> 37:15.010
Amazing.

37:15.830 --> 37:17.750
You weren't at Audrey's,
were you?

37:17.785 --> 37:18.890
No.

37:19.150 --> 37:20.720
Miller seems nice.

37:21.950 --> 37:24.850
It just... he's a lot older than you,

37:24.860 --> 37:27.920
and I just hope you're being
careful with everything,

37:28.110 --> 37:29.300
including your heart.

37:29.335 --> 37:30.490
I love him, Carrie.

37:31.430 --> 37:32.860
And he loves me.

37:34.450 --> 37:36.730
Guess sometimes it's just that simple.

37:37.720 --> 37:39.150
So you're happy?

37:39.460 --> 37:40.820
Really happy.

37:42.090 --> 37:43.540
I'm glad for you.

37:46.090 --> 37:47.795
Is that gonna be...

37:47.830 --> 37:49.500
Sebastian?
I think so.

37:49.770 --> 37:51.180
What do you want me to say?

37:51.215 --> 37:52.390
That I'm not home.

37:52.425 --> 37:53.760
Done.

37:55.500 --> 37:58.520
Where's dad?
Has he asked about me?

37:58.880 --> 38:00.630
No. Um...

38:01.510 --> 38:04.180
I think he's at... the gym.

38:04.810 --> 38:06.950
He spends a lot of time there.

38:07.480 --> 38:08.750
Does it bother you?

38:09.040 --> 38:11.015
Nah. I want dad to have a life.

38:11.050 --> 38:13.240
That way, he won't be
in our faces all the time.

38:16.850 --> 38:18.000
Hey, Dorrit.

38:18.110 --> 38:19.335
Carrie's not home.

38:19.370 --> 38:20.925
Not home or won't see me?

38:20.960 --> 38:22.560
I don't know what's going on
with you two,

38:23.200 --> 38:24.650
but you'll work it out.

38:25.380 --> 38:26.790
This time, I'm not so sure.

38:27.840 --> 38:30.120
Just tell her I wanna see her, okay?

38:30.620 --> 38:33.490
Letting go of people
or traditions is hard

38:33.510 --> 38:35.540
because you invest so much in them,

38:35.610 --> 38:37.560
that to let go can be scary.

38:38.150 --> 38:40.180
But it can also be liberating...

38:43.590 --> 38:46.000
Or even essential to your happiness.

38:48.480 --> 38:50.780
If you don't let go,
you can find yourself

38:50.815 --> 38:52.480
in a dark place...

38:56.930 --> 38:59.570
Unable to kick your worst habits.

39:02.110 --> 39:04.850
And sometimes,
if we truly love someone,

39:04.885 --> 39:06.550
we have to be okay with letting go.

39:10.360 --> 39:13.070
So... what I said
about the gym yesterday...

39:14.050 --> 39:16.760
I'm not sure
i was totally being fair.

39:16.795 --> 39:19.470
No. You are entitled
to your feelings...

39:20.310 --> 39:21.325
about the gym.

39:21.360 --> 39:23.650
But you like it,
and it makes you happy.

39:24.100 --> 39:25.665
And I know mom would want that.

39:25.700 --> 39:28.130
And it's not like Dorrit
and i don't want you to have

39:29.460 --> 39:30.910
a, uh... gym membership.

39:31.390 --> 39:32.610
We do.

39:33.830 --> 39:34.980
Really?

39:35.550 --> 39:37.100
God, you're a great kid.

39:38.090 --> 39:39.215
Right.
So it's settled.

39:39.250 --> 39:40.770
You will be going to the gym.

39:41.580 --> 39:43.120
And I-hope it's okay.

39:43.280 --> 39:44.790
I- I'sure the gym is very nice.

39:44.825 --> 39:46.150
I just, uh...

39:46.660 --> 39:48.520
maybe don't need to meet the gym...

39:48.590 --> 39:49.345
Right now.

39:49.380 --> 39:52.250
Sure. No, I get it.
Yeah. Makes perfect sense.

39:54.070 --> 39:56.270
It's kinda weird how things
are changing for us.

39:56.510 --> 39:58.015
You know, next year
around this time,

39:58.050 --> 39:59.485
I'll be getting ready
to go to college.

39:59.520 --> 40:01.680
I don't want to even imagine you
being gone.

40:01.715 --> 40:02.145
I mean, are you sure

40:02.180 --> 40:04.270
you don't wanna go
to the Community College Nearby

40:04.305 --> 40:06.510
and just... live here forever?

40:06.545 --> 40:07.730
I'm sure.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.490
But I was thinking maybe
we could get the summer

40:10.710 --> 40:11.880
to get used to it?

40:11.930 --> 40:13.850
Me being gone, like a test run.

40:14.610 --> 40:16.200
What did you have in mind?

40:16.530 --> 40:19.130
Well, Larissa will be going to Kyoto
for part of the summer

40:19.165 --> 40:20.945
and said I could stay in her loft.

40:20.980 --> 40:23.060
And since I will be working
at "interview" full-time,

40:23.095 --> 40:24.195
it would be an easier commute,

40:24.230 --> 40:27.530
- So also a practical idea.
- I don't know, Carrie.

40:27.610 --> 40:29.460
I mean, the city
can be a dangerous place

40:29.495 --> 40:30.980
for a girl living all alone.

40:30.990 --> 40:32.800
I wouldn't be alone.
I'd have Walt.

40:32.850 --> 40:34.055
He's just been going through a lot,

40:34.090 --> 40:36.830
and so he's kind of
looking for an escape, too.

40:36.840 --> 40:38.260
Is Walt in some sort of trouble?

40:38.295 --> 40:40.155
No. It just might be good

40:40.190 --> 40:42.600
for him not to spend
the whole summer in Castlebury.

40:42.750 --> 40:44.870
As I can attest to,
it can feel like a pretty small town

40:44.905 --> 40:46.490
when you're struggling with stuff.

40:47.350 --> 40:48.760
Let me think about it.

40:49.020 --> 40:51.150
You living alone in New York
would be a big deal.

40:51.490 --> 40:52.590
So it's not a "no"?

40:54.000 --> 40:55.320
It is not a "no"

40:56.140 --> 40:57.280
I'll take it.

41:00.120 --> 41:03.280
Geoffrey Chaucer wrote,
"time heals all wounds. "

41:06.820 --> 41:08.365
But what he failed to mention

41:08.400 --> 41:10.760
was the scars those wounds leave behind.

41:11.290 --> 41:13.420
The painful things
that happen to us permanently

41:13.455 --> 41:14.900
leave their mark.

41:17.870 --> 41:19.705
They don't necessarily hurt anymore

41:19.740 --> 41:23.270
but they're always there
as a reminder, as a memory.

41:28.580 --> 41:29.815
And as time passes,

41:29.850 --> 41:32.070
maybe the memory gets a little fuzzy.

41:37.570 --> 41:40.440
But we always have the scar
to remind us it happened...

41:41.550 --> 41:44.810
that we lived through it,
that we survived.

41:47.740 --> 41:50.150
And maybe I had some scars on me,

41:51.180 --> 41:53.175
but I felt like I was now ready

41:53.210 --> 41:55.170
to leave my mark on the world.

41:56.305 --> 42:02.244
