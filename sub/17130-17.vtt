WEBVTT

00:02.936 --> 00:04.772
HOW WAS YOUR FIRST BIKE RIDE
WITH MY DAD?

00:04.772 --> 00:06.006
I'M BEAT.

00:06.006 --> 00:08.276
I HAD NO IDEA
GEORGE COULD GO SO FAST.

00:08.276 --> 00:10.611
HE LEAD ME
THE ENTIRE TIME.

00:10.611 --> 00:12.613
THAT'S 'CAUSE I DIDN'T WANNA
BE SEEN WITH YOU.

00:12.613 --> 00:14.615
TONIGHT,
I'M GONNA HAVE NIGHTMARES

00:14.615 --> 00:17.218
ABOUT BEING CHASED BY A GIANT
BANANA WITH A MUSTACHE.

00:18.886 --> 00:20.521
HELLO.

00:22.290 --> 00:24.758
ERNIE, YOU MAY
BE A LITTLE SLOWER,

00:24.758 --> 00:28.629
BUT I AM SO PROUD YOU'RE GETTIN'
OUT THERE AND EXERCISING.

00:28.629 --> 00:29.897
YEAH.

00:29.897 --> 00:31.399
ANGIE, HE NEVER MADE IT.

00:31.399 --> 00:33.901
HE FELL ASLEEP
STRETCHIN' ON THE LAWN.

00:33.901 --> 00:37.105
WE'LL HAVE TO REPLANT THE GRASS
WHERE HE WAS LAYING.

00:37.105 --> 00:38.806
THEN WHY ARE YOU SWEATING?

00:38.806 --> 00:41.509
OH, THAT'S NOT SWEAT.
THE SPRINKLERS WOKE ME UP.

00:41.509 --> 00:44.645
YEAH. YEAH.
I WAS HAVING A NIGHTMARE

00:44.645 --> 00:46.714
THAT I GAINED A WHOLE BUNCH
OF WEIGHT. (laughs)

00:46.714 --> 00:49.417
WHAT A RELIEF
WHEN YOU WOKE UP.
MM-HMM.

00:52.320 --> 00:54.322
HEY, UNCLE GEORGE,

00:54.322 --> 00:55.823
I'M REALLY GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

00:55.823 --> 00:57.991
I WANT YOU GUYS TO SEE
THESE HANDBAGS I DESIGNED.

00:57.991 --> 01:00.928
I'M GONNA TRY TO SELL 'EM
TO SOME OF THE LOCAL BOUTIQUES.

01:00.928 --> 01:05.399
YOU KNOW WHAT, VERONICA?
THESE SKETCHES ARE PRETTY GOOD.

01:05.399 --> 01:07.835
YOU'VE GOT SOME TALENT.

01:07.835 --> 01:09.537
(Veronica) THANK YOU.

01:09.537 --> 01:11.439
WHOA...

01:11.439 --> 01:13.674
HOW COME YOU NEVER TOLD ME
I HAD TALENT

01:13.674 --> 01:15.676
WHEN I WAS A KID?
OH, I'M SORRY, GEORGE.

01:15.676 --> 01:19.180
I SHOULD HAVE TOLD YOU.
YOU DID HAVE A SPECIAL TALENT.

01:19.180 --> 01:22.082
NO ONE CAN WET THE BED
LIKE YOU.

01:24.385 --> 01:27.721
I'M GONNA USE THAT TALENT
TO WATER YOUR GRAVE.

01:29.857 --> 01:33.227
YOU KNOW, UP UNTIL NOW,
MY GRANDDAUGHTER HAS JUST BEEN

01:33.227 --> 01:35.028
A SPOILED PARTY GIRL.

01:35.028 --> 01:37.231
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
I'VE SEEN HER SHOW AMBITION,

01:37.231 --> 01:39.667
AND YOU TWO
SHOULD BE PROUD OF YOURSELVES.

01:39.667 --> 01:43.304
YOU TWO? LOOK, I'M THE TRUSTEE
OF VERONICA'S ESTATE.

01:43.304 --> 01:45.306
MY NIECE'S LIFE
IS IN MY HANDS.

01:45.306 --> 01:47.308
BEFORE ME,
SHE WAS LIKE A BABY HORSE

01:47.308 --> 01:49.910
WHO DIDN'T KNOW
HOW TO USE HER LEGS,

01:49.910 --> 01:51.212
AND SHE WENT LIKE THAT.

01:51.212 --> 01:53.914
(telephone rings)

01:53.914 --> 01:56.750
AHEM. EVERYONE...

01:56.750 --> 01:59.653
ALLOW ME TO PRESENT

01:59.653 --> 02:02.923
THE DEBUT
OF "PURSES BY VERONICA." BOOM.

02:02.923 --> 02:05.859
**

02:11.932 --> 02:14.034
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

02:14.034 --> 02:16.237
YOU GET THE CLUTCH.
I GET THE ONE WITH THE STRAP.

02:16.237 --> 02:17.571
WE AGREED.

02:19.507 --> 02:20.808
GO AHEAD, VATO.
STAND UP

02:20.808 --> 02:23.143
AND FIGHT FOR YOUR PURSE
LIKE A MAN.

02:24.745 --> 02:28.616
GEORGE, CAN I TALK TO YOU
FOR A SECOND?

02:30.284 --> 02:32.286
THAT WAS MY BROTHER
ON THE PHONE.

02:32.286 --> 02:35.623
HE'S ON HIS WAY OVER HERE.
I THOUGHT ONE OF RAY'S SCAMS
WENT BUST

02:35.623 --> 02:37.625
AND HE HAD TO FLEE THE COUNTRY.
BUT THAT WAS YEARS AGO.

02:37.625 --> 02:40.328
WHY IS HE POPPING UP HERE
ALL OF A SUDDEN?

02:40.328 --> 02:43.331
I DON'T KNOW, ANGIE.
HE'S A CON MAN,

02:43.331 --> 02:45.333
HIS DAUGHTER INHERITED
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS,

02:45.333 --> 02:47.134
I'M IN CHARGE OF HER MONEY.

02:47.134 --> 02:50.771
MAYBE HE'S HERE BECAUSE
THE LEMONS ARE RIPE ON THE TREE.

02:50.771 --> 02:53.907
MAYBE HE'S HERE
BECAUSE HE FEELS BAD

02:53.907 --> 02:56.109
ABOUT MISSING
HIS EX-WIFE'S FUNERAL,

02:56.109 --> 02:57.911
AND HE'S HERE FOR VERONICA.

02:57.911 --> 02:59.313
(doorbell rings)

02:59.313 --> 03:01.315
THERE YOU GO AGAIN
BEING ALL SOFT AND FORGIVING.

03:01.315 --> 03:03.317
ANGIE, WE GOTTA BE HARD.
HEY, SHOW RAY

03:03.317 --> 03:06.754
HE CAN'T JUST WIN US OVER
BY BEING ALL CHARMING.

03:09.156 --> 03:11.559
ANGIE.

03:20.734 --> 03:22.002
RAY.

03:22.002 --> 03:24.405
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

03:26.073 --> 03:27.608
GEORGIE.

03:33.847 --> 03:35.649
GIMME A HUG.

03:40.087 --> 03:41.489
YOU LOOK GREAT.

03:41.489 --> 03:43.491
HAVE YOU BEEN
ICING YOUR HEAD?

03:43.491 --> 03:45.493
IT LOOKS A LOT SMALLER.

03:45.493 --> 03:49.397
THANK YOU, BUT NO.
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' HERE, RAY?

03:49.397 --> 03:51.965
I CAME TO MAKE UP
FOR EVERYTHING. THANK YOU.

03:53.200 --> 03:56.737
THIS IS FOR YOU.
THIS IS FOR YOU.

03:56.737 --> 03:59.607
RAY, A CRYSTAL CANDY DISH
DOES NOT MAKE UP

03:59.607 --> 04:01.809
FOR RUNNING OUT
ON YOUR DAUGHTER.

04:01.809 --> 04:04.312
A HIGH-DEF CAMCORDER!
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!

04:04.312 --> 04:06.447
WELCOME TO MY HOUSE, RAY!

04:10.351 --> 04:13.487
(War's "Low Rider" playing)

04:16.557 --> 04:19.693
* ALL MY FRIENDS

04:19.693 --> 04:21.261
* KNOW THE LOW RIDER

04:32.105 --> 04:35.476
YOU LOOK GOOD, RAY.
NOW IS THAT THE SUIT YOU WORE

04:35.476 --> 04:38.178
WHEN YOU WERE SELLING CONDOS
THAT DIDN'T EXIST?

04:38.178 --> 04:40.080
THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO,
GEORGIE.

04:40.080 --> 04:42.450
I'M A DIFFERENT PERSON NOW,
BUT THANKS AGAIN

04:42.450 --> 04:45.353
FOR THE DEPOSIT ON THAT
OCEANFRONT PENTHOUSE.

04:45.353 --> 04:46.954
WHAT?

04:46.954 --> 04:49.657
YOU DIDN'T SEE THE BROCHURES.
IT WAS BEAUTIFUL.

04:49.657 --> 04:52.426
EVERYONE'S ON THE BEACH
LAUGHING, PLAYING VOLLEYBALL,

04:52.426 --> 04:55.429
WHITE PEOPLE SERVING DRINKS...

04:56.830 --> 04:58.566
THAT'S WHAT GOT ME.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.102
WOULD IT MAKE YOU FEEL
ANY BETTER

05:02.102 --> 05:04.705
IF I TOLD YOU THAT MONEY
WENT TO CHARITY?
DID IT?

05:04.705 --> 05:07.575
WELL, HER MIDDLE NAME
WAS CHARITY, BUT...

05:10.210 --> 05:11.845
HEY, WHAT'S TAKING SO LONG?

05:11.845 --> 05:15.383
VERONICA'S WAITING
WITH HER PURSES.
PAPI.

05:20.020 --> 05:21.522
PAPI, UH...

05:21.522 --> 05:24.592
I SEE MOM'S NOT PICKING OUT
YOUR CLOTHES ANYMORE.

05:26.360 --> 05:28.061
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

05:28.061 --> 05:30.197
YOU KNOW, YOU LOOK
A LOT LIKE MY SON RAY,

05:30.197 --> 05:34.802
BUT IT'S BEEN SO LONG,
I'M NOT SURE. LET ME SEE.

05:34.802 --> 05:40.273
YEP, THERE'S THE TRAIL OF SLIME
ON THE GROUND BEHIND YOU.

05:40.273 --> 05:41.709
IT'S YOU.

05:41.709 --> 05:43.711
DAD, I KNOW I'VE DONE
SOME BAD THINGS IN LIFE,

05:43.711 --> 05:47.247
AND, LISTEN, I'VE TAKEN MONEY
FROM OLD PEOPLE,

05:47.247 --> 05:51.885
KIDS, THE FEEBLEMINDED--AGAIN,
SORRY ABOUT THAT CONDO.

05:55.055 --> 05:57.991
BUT I JUST CAME BACK
TO MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

05:57.991 --> 06:01.294
HERE'S A CASHIER'S CHECK
FOR ALL THE MONEY

06:01.294 --> 06:03.431
I'VE TAKEN FROM YOU
OVER THE YEARS.

06:07.401 --> 06:09.302
AND HERE'S A CHECK FOR YOU.

06:09.302 --> 06:11.171
YOU DON'T OWE ME ANYTHING.

06:11.171 --> 06:13.173
WELL, YOU REMEMBER
YOUR BEST FRIEND SUSAN?

06:13.173 --> 06:16.143
WELL, SHE WASN'T THE ONE WHO
STOLE YOUR BABY-SITTING MONEY.

06:16.143 --> 06:17.545
YOU TOOK IT?

06:17.545 --> 06:20.013
I TOLD HER OFF
AND NEVER SPOKE TO HER AGAIN.

06:20.013 --> 06:22.015
I KNOW, AND SHE WAS VERY UPSET.
SO I WAS TRYING TO CHEER HER UP.

06:22.015 --> 06:24.017
SO I TOOK THAT MONEY
I STOLE FROM YOU

06:24.017 --> 06:26.954
AND I RENTED A HOTEL ROOM
AND SLEPT WITH HER.

06:28.522 --> 06:30.791
AGAIN, DIFFERENT PERSON.

06:30.791 --> 06:33.561
WAIT, YOU GUYS
CAN'T JUST TAKE HIS MONEY.

06:33.561 --> 06:35.529
IT COULD BE DIRTY
FOR ALL YOU KNOW.

06:35.529 --> 06:38.131
THIS SHOULD COVER THAT
$500 DEPOSIT YOU GAVE ME

06:38.131 --> 06:39.933
FOR THAT OCEANFRONT CONDO.

06:39.933 --> 06:41.935
WHERE DID YOU GET
THIS MONEY, RAY?

06:41.935 --> 06:43.771
AND DON'T BE VAGUE.
I WANT THE TRUTH.

06:43.771 --> 06:45.506
INVESTING?

06:45.506 --> 06:46.940
GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.

06:49.543 --> 06:52.980
WELL, IT'S NOT
GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.

06:52.980 --> 06:56.083
DAD, I'M LEGIT NOW.

06:56.083 --> 07:00.521
I RAISE VENTURE CAPITAL
TO START NEW BUSINESSES.

07:00.521 --> 07:02.322
I STILL TALK PEOPLE
OUT OF THEIR MONEY,

07:02.322 --> 07:05.459
BUT I DON'T HAVE TO DYE MY HAIR
AND PRETEND I'M GREEK. OPA!

07:05.459 --> 07:09.597
(singing in Greek)

07:09.597 --> 07:11.198
THAT'S FUNNY,

07:11.198 --> 07:13.467
AND NOW YOU'RE HERE
PRETENDING THAT YOU'VE CHANGED.

07:13.467 --> 07:15.102
BULL CRAP!

07:15.102 --> 07:17.037
(singing)

07:18.539 --> 07:20.774
I HAVE CHANGED.

07:20.774 --> 07:23.243
LAST YEAR,
I WOKE UP IN--IN JAIL.

07:23.243 --> 07:25.045
I HAD ONE PHONE CALL,

07:25.045 --> 07:27.047
AND WHEN MY OWN SISTER
WOULDN'T COME TO THE PHONE,

07:27.047 --> 07:29.617
I REALIZED THAT
I HAD PUSHED EVERYONE AWAY.

07:29.617 --> 07:31.151
(George) OH, THAT'S RIGHT.

07:31.151 --> 07:35.155
YOUR BROTHER CALLED LAST YEAR.
HE NEEDS YOUR HELP RIGHT AWAY.

07:38.692 --> 07:40.861
I TOLD YOU TO PUT
A PAD BY THE PHONE.

07:40.861 --> 07:44.264
I CAN'T REMEMBER
THOSE THINGS.

07:44.264 --> 07:48.301
WHAT IS THE HOLDUP?
YOU GUYS ARE TAKING FOR--

07:48.301 --> 07:50.504
DAD?

07:50.504 --> 07:53.006
MY GOODNESS, VERONICA,
YOU'RE ALL GROWN UP.

07:54.174 --> 07:56.209
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS

07:56.209 --> 07:58.612
WHEN YOU HAVEN'T SEEN SOMEONE
IN FIVE YEARS.
I KNOW.

07:58.612 --> 08:00.013
I-I'VE BEEN
A TERRIBLE FATHER,

08:00.013 --> 08:02.015
AND I DON'T EXPECT YOU
TO FORGIVE ME.

08:02.015 --> 08:04.017
I JUST WANNA LET YOU KNOW
THAT I...

08:04.017 --> 08:05.653
I WANNA BE PART
OF YOUR LIFE AGAIN.

08:05.653 --> 08:08.856
WELL, LET ME
THINK ABOUT IT.

08:08.856 --> 08:10.658
NOPE.

08:12.292 --> 08:16.630
IS IT DECEMBER ALREADY,
BECAUSE THAT WAS A COLD SNAP.

08:16.630 --> 08:19.567
YES. SHE'S HARD LIKE ME,

08:19.567 --> 08:21.869
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN
TAKING HER UNDER MY WING.

08:21.869 --> 08:24.304
ANGIE, CAN YOU PLEASE
TALK TO HER FOR ME?

08:24.304 --> 08:26.106
SHE'S NOT GONNA DO IT EITHER,

08:26.106 --> 08:29.376
BECAUSE Â¿SABESQUÃ©?
SHE'S UNDER THE OTHER WING.

08:29.376 --> 08:31.945
I'LL GO TALK TO HER.

08:31.945 --> 08:36.717
ANGIE, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
HEY, GET BACK UNDER MY WING.

08:38.385 --> 08:43.223
VERONICA, IT SEEMS LIKE YOUR DAD
IS TRYING TO MAKE AMENDS.

08:43.223 --> 08:45.859
HOW WILL YOU EVER KNOW
HE'S CHANGED

08:45.859 --> 08:47.728
UNLESS YOU TALK TO HIM?

08:47.728 --> 08:49.362
NO, DON'T LET HIM HURT YOU
AGAIN. KEEP YOUR HEART HARD

08:49.362 --> 08:52.065
LIKE THERE'S A SHELL AROUND IT,
L-LIKE A LOBSTER.

08:52.065 --> 08:55.068
THEN THE ONLY WAY PEOPLE CAN
HURT YOU IS TO CRACK YOUR SHELL

08:55.068 --> 08:58.772
AND GET AT YOUR MEAT
WITH A TINY LITTLE FORK.

09:01.609 --> 09:03.611
I KNOW YOUR FATHER
HAS HURT YOU,

09:03.611 --> 09:05.913
BUT DEEP DOWN,
HE DOES HAVE A GOOD HEART.

09:05.913 --> 09:09.449
IF YOU DON'T GIVE HIM
A CHANCE TO PROVE HIMSELF,

09:09.449 --> 09:12.152
YOU MIGHT ALWAYS REGRET IT.

09:13.486 --> 09:17.791
ALL RIGHT. I GUESS I CAN HEAR
WHAT HE HAS TO SAY.

09:20.227 --> 09:21.662
(sighs)

09:21.662 --> 09:24.698
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA STOP
BEIN' SO SOFT?

09:24.698 --> 09:26.700
PLEASE, I'VE SEEN YOU CRY
AT A COMMERCIAL

09:26.700 --> 09:30.070
WHEN THE FATHER AND SON
PLAY CATCH, LOBSTER BOY.

09:32.773 --> 09:36.644
MY SON'S MODELING PURSES.
YOU DON'T KNOW MY PAIN.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.049
WHERE'S VERONICA?

09:42.049 --> 09:44.251
SHE'S OUT WITH RAY AGAIN.

09:44.251 --> 09:46.253
I DON'T LIKE THIS, ANGIE.

09:46.253 --> 09:48.656
HE'S BEEN WORKIN' HER ALL WEEK
JUST SO HE COULD GET HER MONEY.

09:48.656 --> 09:50.658
(sighs) GEORGE,
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

09:50.658 --> 09:52.459
MY BROTHER'S
GOT HIS OWN MONEY NOW.

09:52.459 --> 09:55.663
HOW CAN YOU TRUST RAY AFTER
ALL HE'S DONE TO YOUR FAMILY?

09:55.663 --> 09:59.667
BECAUSE I TRY
TO FIND THE GOOD IN PEOPLE.

09:59.667 --> 10:03.804
WELL, THAT'S A REALLY
ANNOYING HABIT.

10:03.804 --> 10:06.139
YOU CAN'T ADMIT
YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT RAY

10:06.139 --> 10:09.810
BECAUSE YOU CAN NEVER ADMIT
YOU'RE WRONG ABOUT ANYTHING.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.712
WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE
WHENEVER I DO, YOU DO THIS--

10:11.712 --> 10:13.046
"THAT'S ANOTHER ONE FOR ME,"

10:13.046 --> 10:15.716
LIKE YOU'RE KEEPIN'
AN IMAGINARY SCORE.

10:15.716 --> 10:21.454
IT'S NOT IMAGINARY.
THE SCORE IS 72-0.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.390
HEY.
(Ray imitates horse)

10:25.759 --> 10:27.560
(Ray) VERONICA,
TELL THEM THE GOOD NEWS.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.362
OH, YEAH. SO DAD AND I

10:29.362 --> 10:33.333
ARE GONNA START
A HANDBAG BUSINESS IN MIAMI.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.268
I NEED MY INHERITANCE.

10:37.938 --> 10:42.743
THAT'S 72--
WATCH OUT--TO ONE.

10:49.683 --> 10:51.852
TO START THE BUSINESS,
BUT HE'S WILLING

10:51.852 --> 10:55.255
TO PUT UP $2 MILLION
OF HIS OWN MONEY.

10:55.255 --> 10:57.257
I HAD THE FINANCE GUY
AT MY FIRM

10:57.257 --> 11:00.360
DRAW UP A BUSINESS PLAN.
YOU SHOULD LOOK IT OVER.

11:00.360 --> 11:01.862
HEY, IT LOOKS GREAT.

11:01.862 --> 11:03.897
ANGIE, YOU WANNA COME
IN THE LIVING ROOM WITH ME,

11:03.897 --> 11:06.666
HELP ME FIND THE TRUST FUND
CHECKBOOK?
IT'S RIGHT HERE.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.301
OH...

11:08.301 --> 11:10.904
YEAH, I FORGOT.
OH, COME WITH ME ANYWAYS,

11:10.904 --> 11:13.240
'CAUSE I GOTTA HELP
FIND MY READING GLASSES.

11:13.240 --> 11:15.843
SINCE WHEN ARE YOUR EYES SO BAD
YOU NEED READING GLASSES?

11:15.843 --> 11:17.410
OH, CHALE,
JUST COME WITH ME.

11:17.410 --> 11:18.812
(Ray) GEORGE...

11:18.812 --> 11:21.949
I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA
TALK ABOUT ME IN THERE.

11:21.949 --> 11:24.451
SO WHATEVER
YOU'RE GONNA SAY TO ANGIE,

11:24.451 --> 11:26.686
JUST SAY IT TO MY FACE.

11:28.688 --> 11:31.058
ANGIE, RAY'S BEEN HERE A WEEK,

11:31.058 --> 11:33.326
AND HE'S ALREADY GOT VERONICA
ASKING FOR HER MONEY.

11:33.326 --> 11:36.196
IT'S OBVIOUS
HE'S TRYING TO RIP HER OFF.

11:36.196 --> 11:38.398
I'M SO SORRY
YOU FEEL THAT WAY, GEORGE.

11:38.398 --> 11:40.400
NEXT TIME, I'LL BE
A LITTLE BIT MORE SENSITIVE

11:40.400 --> 11:43.436
AND MAKE UP THE BUSINESS PLAN
OUT OF MACARONI AND GLITTER

11:43.436 --> 11:46.339
SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND IT.

11:46.339 --> 11:49.810
LOOK, I KNOW
WHAT THIS CON IS, OKAY,

11:49.810 --> 11:52.512
AND I KNOW THAT YOU KNEW
THAT I'D BE SUSPICIOUS

11:52.512 --> 11:54.414
IF YOU SUCKED UP TO ME,

11:54.414 --> 11:56.416
BUT DID YOU KNOW
THAT I KNEW THAT YOU KNEW

11:56.416 --> 11:58.852
THAT I'D KNOW WHAT YOU KNEW?
GEORGE.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.422
I'M ABOUT TO CRACK THIS THING,
ANGIE. BACK OFF.

12:02.422 --> 12:04.191
OKAY.

12:04.191 --> 12:06.927
OKAY, LET'S TALK
ABOUT THIS RATIONALLY.

12:06.927 --> 12:09.262
GEORGE, I WILL SAY,

12:09.262 --> 12:11.464
MY BROTHER IS PUTTING UP
HIS OWN MONEY,

12:11.464 --> 12:13.233
AND HE HAS A BUSINESS PLAN.

12:13.233 --> 12:16.236
THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE
THE OLD RAY TO ME.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.238
AND I BROUGHT MY BANK STATEMENT
AND BUSINESS REFERENCES.

12:18.238 --> 12:21.374
PLUS, TO PROVE TO YOU
THAT I HAVE CHANGED,

12:21.374 --> 12:24.845
HERE'S A PHOTOGRAPH OF ME
AND AN UGLY WOMAN I'M DATING.

12:26.246 --> 12:29.850
I CAN NEVER GET MY SIDEBURNS
TO GROW LIKE THAT.

12:29.850 --> 12:34.487
SHE SHOULD NEVER
TAKE A PICTURE AFTER 5:00.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.829
UNCLE GEORGE,

12:41.829 --> 12:43.831
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT

12:43.831 --> 12:45.833
BEING AMBITIOUS
AND WORKING HARD.

12:45.833 --> 12:47.835
WELL, THIS BUSINESS
IS MY DREAM,

12:47.835 --> 12:50.203
AND I CAN'T DO IT
WITHOUT MY DAD.

12:51.671 --> 12:53.306
ALL RIGHT, LOOK,

12:53.306 --> 12:56.109
I DON'T WANNA STAND IN THE WAY
OF YOUR HAPPINESS...

12:56.109 --> 12:58.345
BUT I'M NOT WRITIN'
A CHECK THIS BIG

12:58.345 --> 13:00.780
TO A 20-YEAR-OLD GIRL.
RAY...

13:00.780 --> 13:02.582
YOU HAVE
THE BUSINESS EXPERIENCE.

13:02.582 --> 13:04.584
I'LL MAKE IT OUT
TO YOUR CORPORATION.
YES!

13:04.584 --> 13:07.720
OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH!
MY BUSINESS IS GONNA BE HUGE!

13:07.720 --> 13:09.489
I PROMISE! OH!

13:09.489 --> 13:13.994
CAN YOU BELIEVE YOU'RE WRITING
A CHECK FOR $2 MILLION?

13:13.994 --> 13:15.395
ANGIE, PLEASE,
I RUN A FACTORY.

13:15.395 --> 13:17.998
I DEAL WITH THIS KIND
OF MONEY ALL THE TIME.

13:20.100 --> 13:22.435
TAKE A PICTURE OF ME
HOLDING THE CHECK.

13:35.415 --> 13:38.151
YOU WOULDN'T BE TRYIN'
TO SKIP OUTTA TOWN

13:38.151 --> 13:40.420
WITH THE CHECK,
WOULD YOU, RAY?

13:40.420 --> 13:42.489
WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT?
I'M GOIN' FOR A WALK.

13:42.489 --> 13:43.790
A LITTLE EXERCISE.

13:43.790 --> 13:45.358
WITH YOUR SUITCASE?

13:45.358 --> 13:48.395
WELL, I LEFT
MY DUMBBELLS IN MIAMI.

13:49.562 --> 13:51.464
(car horn honks)

13:51.464 --> 13:53.366
AND THE CAB OUT FRONT?

13:53.366 --> 13:55.368
YOU KNOW LANCE ARMSTRONG,
WHEN HE TRAINS,

13:55.368 --> 13:57.871
YOU KNOW, HE'S GOT A VAN
THAT FOLLOWS HIM AROUND.

13:57.871 --> 14:00.273
I PREFER A CAB.

14:05.445 --> 14:09.016
MAN, I KNEW YOU'D TRY TO SNEAK
OUTTA HERE WITH THE CHECK.

14:09.016 --> 14:11.284
GEORGIE, COME HERE.

14:11.284 --> 14:14.687
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE A LOT SMARTER
THAN I THOUGHT YOU WERE...

14:14.687 --> 14:17.090
BUT ARE YOU SMART ENOUGH
TO LOOK THE OTHER WAY

14:17.090 --> 14:19.392
FOR HALF A MILLION DOLLARS?

14:19.392 --> 14:21.394
ARE YOU TRYING
TO BRIBE ME WITH MONEY

14:21.394 --> 14:23.230
YOU'RE STEALING
FROM YOUR OWN DAUGHTER?

14:23.230 --> 14:27.000
OH.
YES, AND YOU PASSED
THE TEST.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.136
GOOD THING
YOU'RE HONEST, GEORGE,

14:29.136 --> 14:31.138
BECAUSE MONEY
CORRUPTS PEOPLE,

14:31.138 --> 14:33.974
AND I'M JUST TRYING
TO SAVE VERONICA FROM THAT.

14:33.974 --> 14:36.076
AND BY THE WAY...

14:36.076 --> 14:39.913
BOATS DON'T CORRUPT PEOPLE.

14:39.913 --> 14:43.150
WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO BUY YOU A BOAT?

14:43.150 --> 14:45.152
YOU'RE NOT BUYING ANYTHING
WITH THAT CHECK.

14:45.152 --> 14:47.420
MAN, I KNEW YOU'D PULL
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

14:47.420 --> 14:49.689
SO I CANCELED IT,
AND JUST IN CASE,

14:49.689 --> 14:53.160
I SIGNED IT "CARLOS SANTANA."

14:56.496 --> 14:58.165
YOU KNOW, I BET
YOU NEVER HAD ANY MONEY.

14:58.165 --> 15:00.100
YOU MADE UP ALL THAT STUFF
ABOUT BEIN' A SUCCESS

15:00.100 --> 15:01.901
JUST SO YOU COULD SET US UP.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.237
GEORGIE, YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'VE BEEN GOIN' THROUGH.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.239
I OWE A LOT OF MONEY
TO PEOPLE

15:06.239 --> 15:08.241
YOU DON'T WANNA
OWE MONEY TO.

15:08.241 --> 15:11.278
THEN HOW DID YOU COME UP
WITH THE CASH TO PAY VIC BACK?

15:11.278 --> 15:13.580
I HAD AN ESTATE SALE.

15:13.580 --> 15:16.016
IT WASN'T MY HOUSE,
AND THE PEOPLE WERE ON VACATION,

15:16.016 --> 15:18.285
BUT IT WAS SUCCESSFUL.

15:20.653 --> 15:22.389
YOU KNOW WHAT'S WORSE

15:22.389 --> 15:24.524
THAN STEALING MONEY
FROM YOUR DAUGHTER?

15:24.524 --> 15:27.194
IS YOU ACTUALLY MADE HER THINK
YOU CARED ABOUT HER.

15:27.194 --> 15:29.062
DON'T MAKE A MISTAKE.
I LOVE MY DAUGHTER.

15:29.062 --> 15:30.397
THEN PROVE IT.

15:30.397 --> 15:32.399
YOU STAY THE NIGHT,
YOU COME DOWN FOR BREAKFAST,

15:32.399 --> 15:34.401
AND YOU TELL VERONICA
YOU HAVE TO LEAVE.

15:34.401 --> 15:36.703
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOUR EXCUSE
IS, BUT YOU MAKE HER BELIEVE IT,

15:36.703 --> 15:38.905
BECAUSE I'M NOT GONNA
LET YOU BREAK HER HEART.

15:38.905 --> 15:40.207
OKAY, GEORGIE.

15:40.207 --> 15:43.110
I'M GONNA DO THAT
FOR VERONICA.

15:45.178 --> 15:47.214
I WISH I COULD
DO SOMETHING FOR YOU.

15:49.216 --> 15:51.151
HEY, GEORGE, DO YOU KNOW
THAT BUFFALO MEAT

15:51.151 --> 15:54.087
IS A LOT LEANER THAN CATTLE?

15:54.087 --> 15:58.091
I'M NOT INVESTING
IN A RANCH, RAY.

16:00.893 --> 16:03.096
A PILL THAT MAKES YOU TALLER?

16:05.065 --> 16:06.466
UPSTAIRS.

16:09.269 --> 16:11.471
A BULLET TRAIN
FROM HERE TO VEGAS?

16:11.471 --> 16:13.106
GO!

16:18.145 --> 16:20.880
YOU WANT SOME HELP
WITH THE DISHES?

16:20.880 --> 16:23.016
NO, THAT'S OKAY.
I GOT IT.

16:26.086 --> 16:28.155
(sighs) OKAY.

16:28.155 --> 16:29.356
I DON'T WANNA
MISS MY FLIGHT.

16:29.356 --> 16:30.723
THIS SUCKS.
I KNOW.

16:30.723 --> 16:32.459
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU HAVE TO GO RIGHT NOW.

16:32.459 --> 16:34.994
I KNOW. I'M SORRY, HONEY.

16:34.994 --> 16:38.098
I HAVE AN EMERGENCY
SHAREHOLDER'S MEETING.
SOUNDS LIKE ENOUGH
INFORMATION FOR ME.

16:38.098 --> 16:40.567
YOU'D BETTER GET GOIN'.

16:40.567 --> 16:42.635
CALL ME
WHEN YOU GET TO MIAMI,

16:42.635 --> 16:44.571
AND WE'LL GO OVER
THE BUSINESS PLAN.

16:44.571 --> 16:46.406
I HAVE SOME BAD NEWS
ABOUT THAT.

16:47.774 --> 16:50.477
I CAN'T COME UP
WITH MY END OF THE MONEY.

16:50.477 --> 16:52.612
OH...

16:52.612 --> 16:54.747
WHAT IF I PUT UP
ALL THE MONEY?

16:54.747 --> 16:57.517
GIMME A MINUTE. GEORGIE...

17:02.122 --> 17:05.158
WELL, I-I COULDN'T
LET YOU DO THAT.

17:05.158 --> 17:06.926
(car horn honks)

17:06.926 --> 17:09.762
I GOTTA GO. LISTEN TO ME...

17:09.762 --> 17:12.299
JUST KEEP WORKING
ON YOUR DESIGNS. YOU'RE...

17:12.299 --> 17:15.435
YOU'RE A VERY TALENTED GIRL,
AND I'M VERY PROUD OF YOU.

17:16.403 --> 17:18.638
I'LL SEE YOU SOON.
OKAY.

17:18.638 --> 17:22.342
WHY DON'T I HELP YOU
WITH YOUR BAGS, RAY?
OKAY.

17:23.810 --> 17:25.612
OH. WAIT A MINUTE.

17:25.612 --> 17:28.248
I WANT YOU TO LOOK GOOD
FOR YOUR SHAREHOLDER'S MEETING.

17:28.248 --> 17:31.784
GEORGE TOLD ME EVERYTHING.
YOU DISGUST ME.

17:31.784 --> 17:33.420
OH.

17:35.222 --> 17:37.224
I'VE HAD A LOT OF WOMEN
TRY TO CHOKE ME.

17:37.224 --> 17:38.725
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO DO A LOT BETTER THAN THAT.

17:38.725 --> 17:39.859
OH.

17:39.859 --> 17:43.396
UNH. (whispers)
THAT'S BETTER.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.972
SOMETHING'S NOT RIGHT.

17:52.972 --> 17:56.476
MY DAD COULDN'T EVEN LOOK ME
IN THE EYE AT BREAKFAST.

17:56.476 --> 18:00.079
WELL, YOU KNOW, HE'S GOT
THAT BIG MEETING ON HIS MIND.

18:00.079 --> 18:02.081
WHAT'S GOING ON,
UNCLE GEORGE?

18:02.081 --> 18:03.383
AND TELL ME THE TRUTH.

18:03.383 --> 18:06.153
ALL RIGHT,
YOU WANT THE TRUTH?

18:06.153 --> 18:09.589
HERE IT IS--
PURPLE'S NOT YOUR COLOR.

18:11.958 --> 18:16.396
YOU LOOK LIKE A BIG GRAPE.
THERE, I SAID IT. LET'S MOVE ON.

18:16.396 --> 18:19.866
HE HAD THAT SAME LOOK
ON HIS FACE

18:19.866 --> 18:21.301
WHEN HE LEFT FIVE YEARS AGO

18:21.301 --> 18:23.670
WITH ALL THE MONEY I GOT
FROM MY QUINCEAÃ‘ERA.

18:25.272 --> 18:29.142
OH, MY GOD.
HE HAS THE CHECK.

18:29.142 --> 18:31.077
HE'S LEAVING TOWN
WITH MY MONEY!

18:31.077 --> 18:32.579
NO, HOLD ON.

18:32.579 --> 18:35.782
HE TRIED TO SKIP OUT OF HERE
LAST NIGHT WITH THE CHECK,

18:35.782 --> 18:37.717
BUT I STOPPED HIM.

18:39.319 --> 18:41.321
IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER,

18:41.321 --> 18:43.323
I TAPED A DIGITAL CLOCK
TO A COUPLE OF ROAD FLARES

18:43.323 --> 18:46.226
AND HID IT IN HIS SUITCASE.

18:47.594 --> 18:51.531
THAT OUGHTA START THE PARTY
AT AIRPORT SECURITY.

18:52.532 --> 18:54.534
HE WAS JUST USING ME.

18:54.534 --> 18:56.536
HE NEVER REALLY
CARED ABOUT ME.

18:56.536 --> 18:59.172
NO, DON'T SAY THAT. LOOK,
HE LOVES YOU AS MUCH AS HE CAN.

18:59.172 --> 19:00.507
HE'S JUST MESSED UP.

19:00.507 --> 19:03.776
I CANNOT BELIEVE
THAT I FELL FOR THIS AGAIN.

19:03.776 --> 19:05.345
WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?

19:05.345 --> 19:07.647
NOTHING'S WRONG WITH YOU.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.649
LOOK, WHEN MY DAD LEFT,
I BLAMED MYSELF,

19:09.649 --> 19:12.585
BUT THAT WAS A MISTAKE,
SO DON'T DO THAT.

19:12.585 --> 19:17.390
MY MOM'S DEAD,
MY DAD'S SCUM. I GOT NO ONE.

19:17.390 --> 19:20.527
YOU DON'T EXACTLY
HAVE NO ONE.

19:22.695 --> 19:25.498
THANKS FOR LOOKING OUT
FOR ME.

19:27.267 --> 19:30.237
SEE, THAT'S WHAT I DO.
I PROTECT MY FAMILY.

19:30.237 --> 19:32.239
AS LONG AS
YOU'RE IN THIS HOUSE,

19:32.239 --> 19:34.407
Â¿SABES QUÃ©,
YOU'RE UNDER MY WING.

19:34.407 --> 19:36.609
HEY, WHERE'S RAY?

19:36.609 --> 19:39.646
WE'RE GOING FISHING
ON OUR NEW LAKEFRONT CABIN.

19:39.646 --> 19:41.714
OH, MAN, HE FOUND
SUCH A GOOD DEAL.

19:41.714 --> 19:45.485
HE CALLED ME LAST NIGHT,
AND I WIRED HIM THE DEPOSIT...

19:47.019 --> 19:50.457
AND THE BEST PART IS
WITH THE VIEW FROM MY CABIN,

19:50.457 --> 19:53.460
I CAN SEE MY BUFFALO RANCH.

19:57.430 --> 19:59.432
HE DOESN'T
LIVE IN THIS HOUSE.

19:59.432 --> 20:01.434
SO HE'S ON THE OUTSIDE
OF THE WING.

20:01.434 --> 20:03.636
WHEN I FLY, HE FALLS OFF.

20:08.308 --> 20:10.277
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

20:10.277 --> 20:12.479
PUTTING THESE
STUPID PURSES AWAY.

20:12.479 --> 20:14.481
LOOK, I'VE BEEN THINKIN'.

20:14.481 --> 20:16.483
YOU'VE GROWN UP A LOT
THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS,

20:16.483 --> 20:18.518
AND JUST 'CAUSE YOUR DAD
BAILED ON YOU DOESN'T MEAN

20:18.518 --> 20:21.721
YOU SHOULD GIVE UP
ON YOUR DREAMS.
YEAH, WELL,
I CAN'T DO IT ON MY OWN.

20:21.721 --> 20:24.324
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT RUNNING A BUSINESS.

20:24.324 --> 20:25.692
HMM...

20:25.692 --> 20:27.694
IF THERE WERE ONLY
SOMEPLACE YOU COULD GO

20:27.694 --> 20:30.630
FOR FOUR YEARS
WHERE THEY TEACH YOU THINGS.

20:36.536 --> 20:39.606
IS THIS YOUR WAY OF SAYING
I SHOULD GO TO COLLEGE?

20:39.606 --> 20:42.108
BECAUSE I WOULD LOVE
TO STUDY DESIGN.

20:42.108 --> 20:44.311
LOOK, I'LL TAKE ENOUGH MONEY
OUT OF YOUR INHERITANCE

20:44.311 --> 20:46.446
TO PAY FOR YOUR TUITION,
ROOM AND BOARD.

20:46.446 --> 20:48.615
OH, MY GOD! I ALREADY KNOW
WHERE I WANNA GO.

20:48.615 --> 20:51.951
THE BEST DESIGN SCHOOL
IN THE WORLD IS IN MILAN.

20:51.951 --> 20:53.753
OH, MY GOD, THAT'S SO GREAT,

20:53.753 --> 20:56.456
BUT YOUR ASS
IS GOING TO PASADENA.

20:58.491 --> 21:01.761
UNCLE GEORGE, YOU DON'T KNOW
HOW MUCH IT MEANS

21:01.761 --> 21:05.532
TO HAVE SOMEONE
ACTUALLY BELIEVE IN ME.

21:05.532 --> 21:07.967
THERE'S ONE CONDITION.

21:07.967 --> 21:11.037
WHEN THIS STUFF
GOES INTO PRODUCTION,

21:11.037 --> 21:13.373
I DO ALL THE RUNWAY WORK.

21:15.408 --> 21:18.545
**

21:21.748 --> 21:31.691
WAAPAHH!
