Hi, can I, uh...
can I help you?

01:07.401 --> 01:09.802
I'm not sure if
I have the right place.

01:09.804 --> 01:12.604
A handsome gentleman
promised me an evening

01:12.606 --> 01:14.606
of romance and fine dining.

01:14.608 --> 01:16.742
Huh, okay, well,
I can, uh...

01:16.744 --> 01:18.444
I can definitely help you
with one of those.

01:18.446 --> 01:21.413
I hope it's dinner,
because I'm starving.

01:32.626 --> 01:35.294
Um, excuse me, Kiani?

01:35.296 --> 01:37.162
I'm sorry to interrupt.

01:37.164 --> 01:38.730
I just need to borrow
my son for a second.

01:38.732 --> 01:40.499
Dad, we're in the middle
of a practice test.

01:40.501 --> 01:41.533
It's only gonna take
a second, come on.

01:41.535 --> 01:43.402
Hey, Grace.

01:43.404 --> 01:44.570
How you doing?

01:44.572 --> 01:45.704
Good.

01:45.706 --> 01:47.840
I just got off the
phone with your dad.

01:47.842 --> 01:49.842
Apparently, your grandfather's
surgery went well.

01:49.844 --> 01:51.777
Yeah, Danno said he should
be coming home soon.

01:51.779 --> 01:52.845
Oh, that's nice.

01:52.847 --> 01:54.213
Well, you just remember

01:54.215 --> 01:56.348
our house is your house.

01:56.350 --> 01:58.150
You can spend as much time
over here as you want

01:58.152 --> 01:59.418
while your father's
away, okay?

01:59.420 --> 02:00.352
Thanks, Mr. Grover.

02:00.354 --> 02:01.420
All right.

02:01.422 --> 02:03.489
Come on.

02:05.126 --> 02:06.592
Dad, you know we only get
an hour with the tutor, right?

02:06.594 --> 02:07.826
Yeah, I know.

02:07.828 --> 02:10.896
I'm the one that's
paying for it, remember?

02:10.898 --> 02:12.164
Listen, Grace
seeing anybody?

02:12.166 --> 02:14.433
What?

02:14.435 --> 02:16.835
Look, her father seems
to be convinced that

02:16.837 --> 02:18.904
she's got a boyfriend
on the low,

02:18.906 --> 02:22.274
so he asked me to ask you
if you've heard anything.

02:22.276 --> 02:23.308
Uh, no.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.210
No, no, sorry.

02:25.212 --> 02:26.512
Hey, whoa, whoa,
wait a minute now.

02:26.513 --> 02:27.813
I hardly get to
see you anymore.

02:27.815 --> 02:29.581
Come on, now.
Can you find out?

02:29.583 --> 02:31.350
Uh...

02:31.352 --> 02:32.151
What?

02:32.153 --> 02:33.152
Well, it's just that,

02:33.154 --> 02:34.453
you know, you--

02:34.455 --> 02:35.721
You want me to be a narc.

02:35.723 --> 02:36.822
Hey.

02:36.824 --> 02:38.757
Narcs are heroes.

02:38.759 --> 02:39.925
Don't forget that.

02:39.927 --> 02:41.277
Okay, well,
if Grace's dad wants to know

02:41.278 --> 02:42.628
who she's dating,
why can't he, you know,

02:42.630 --> 02:44.496
just... ask her?

02:44.498 --> 02:47.933
Uh-huh.

02:47.935 --> 02:49.768
So she is seeing somebody.

02:49.770 --> 02:51.837
No, I-I didn't say that,
okay?

02:51.839 --> 02:53.939
Again, why can't he just ask her?
Because...

02:53.941 --> 02:56.909
he doesn't want her to
think he doesn't trust her.

02:56.911 --> 02:57.910
Well, it's pretty obvious
that he doesn't.

02:57.912 --> 03:00.179
Stop arguing with me!

03:00.181 --> 03:01.880
You haven't any idea
what it's like

03:01.882 --> 03:03.916
to raise a daughter,
believe me.

03:03.918 --> 03:06.451
Come on, man, you
can't do this for me?

03:06.453 --> 03:08.487
We're supposed
to be a team.

03:10.558 --> 03:11.523
All right, all right.

03:11.525 --> 03:13.659
All right, my man.
Yes, sir.

03:13.661 --> 03:15.427
Remember this when
I ask for the Xbox.

03:15.429 --> 03:17.496
Hey, don't try
to bribe the police.

03:17.498 --> 03:19.198
It's a felony.

03:24.605 --> 03:26.872
Well, when I was
eight years old,

03:26.874 --> 03:28.507
he took me out
to Barber's Point.

03:28.509 --> 03:31.210
And that was
my very first time.

03:31.212 --> 03:32.844
And you know what?

03:32.846 --> 03:34.913
I caught a six-pound wahoo.

03:34.915 --> 03:37.349
Whoa.
Whoa is right.

03:37.351 --> 03:39.952
But you know what, that
fish was a real fighter.

03:39.954 --> 03:41.920
And after a while,
I yelled to my dad,

03:41.922 --> 03:43.822
I said, "Dad, help!"

03:43.824 --> 03:45.924
You know what he said?

03:45.926 --> 03:48.860
He said, "No way,
you're on your own."

03:48.862 --> 03:50.262
That's mean.

03:50.264 --> 03:52.397
I know, right?
(chuckles)

03:52.399 --> 03:53.932
But you know what I found out

03:53.934 --> 03:57.603
is that he wanted that moment

03:57.605 --> 03:59.838
to be all mine.

03:59.840 --> 04:03.642
So I struggled
and I struggled.

04:03.644 --> 04:05.544
I yanked and yanked,
and then

04:05.546 --> 04:07.879
pulled that fish
out of the water

04:07.881 --> 04:09.881
and brought it
onto the boat.

04:09.883 --> 04:11.850
Will you take me
fishing someday?

04:11.852 --> 04:14.786
Of course, sweetie.

04:14.788 --> 04:16.622
I would love
to take you fishing.

04:16.624 --> 04:18.624
And you know what?

04:18.626 --> 04:19.858
I bet with those
strong arms

04:19.860 --> 04:21.793
you'd be really
good at it, too.

04:21.795 --> 04:24.396
All right, you,

04:24.398 --> 04:25.631
story time's over.

04:25.633 --> 04:27.432
Bedtime now, okay?

04:29.737 --> 04:30.969
Good night, sweetie.

04:30.971 --> 04:33.305
Sweet dreams.

04:37.878 --> 04:40.045
Thanks for babysitting.

04:40.047 --> 04:41.747
We had fun.

04:41.749 --> 04:44.316
Though she refused to go
to bed until you got home.

04:44.318 --> 04:45.684
Yeah, that sounds
about right.

04:45.686 --> 04:46.685
(both chuckle)

04:46.687 --> 04:48.287
I'll take over.

04:49.857 --> 04:51.490
Thanks.

04:51.492 --> 04:55.060
So, how'd it go?

04:55.062 --> 04:57.429
You know,
it's hard to say.

04:57.431 --> 04:59.665
I made my case.

04:59.667 --> 05:01.867
I tried to explain that
blocking or delaying

05:01.869 --> 05:03.935
Sara's adoption was warranted.

05:03.937 --> 05:07.306
The problem is that the court

05:07.308 --> 05:10.809
doesn't want to intervene
unless there's hard evidence

05:10.811 --> 05:12.911
that the child's welfare
could be endangered.

05:12.913 --> 05:15.681
Her uncle's phone number
was found on a cell phone

05:15.683 --> 05:16.882
of a known drug trafficker.

05:16.884 --> 05:18.200
The judge thinks
that makes sense,

05:18.201 --> 05:19.517
considering the fact
that Morales is already

05:19.520 --> 05:20.986
a criminal defense attorney.

05:21.989 --> 05:24.990
(sighs)

05:24.992 --> 05:26.425
Every time I tuck her in,

05:26.427 --> 05:28.393
I think it might be the last.

05:31.832 --> 05:32.964
When are they gonna
let you know?

05:32.966 --> 05:35.434
Most likely in the morning.

05:35.436 --> 05:37.035
(sighs)

05:37.037 --> 05:38.737
But if the adoption
goes through,

05:38.739 --> 05:41.606
she could be on a plane
to Mexico within 48 hours.

05:42.976 --> 05:44.409
Let's hope it
doesn't come to that.

05:48.949 --> 05:52.584
Mmm, my brain is
telling me to stop,

05:52.586 --> 05:54.019
but my stomach's
saying, "Keep going."

05:54.021 --> 05:56.455
You should listen
to your stomach because

05:56.457 --> 05:57.989
we have dessert
coming up.

05:57.991 --> 05:59.424
Yeah? What you got?

05:59.426 --> 06:03.028
Homemade Chantilly cake
with macadamia nuts.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.763
That is impressive.

06:04.765 --> 06:06.465
I better pace myself.

06:06.467 --> 06:08.967
Hey, I love the new haircut.

06:08.969 --> 06:10.769
Yeah?

06:10.771 --> 06:11.904
Yeah, I do.

06:11.905 --> 06:13.038
I think the bangs
are super cute.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.740
Cheers.
Cheers.

06:14.742 --> 06:16.141
I'll go get some more wine.
No, no, no.

06:16.143 --> 06:19.544
You just relax.

06:19.546 --> 06:21.079
You've done enough.

06:29.923 --> 06:31.022
(whispers):
I'll be back.

06:31.024 --> 06:33.825
Okay. I'll be here.

06:33.827 --> 06:34.826
(Lynn chuckles)

06:34.828 --> 06:37.162
(cell phone ringing)

06:41.468 --> 06:42.467
Hello?

06:42.469 --> 06:44.970
WOMAN: Steve?

06:44.972 --> 06:46.405
Catherine?

06:46.407 --> 06:47.739
Yeah, it's me.

06:47.741 --> 06:50.175
Can you talk?

06:50.177 --> 06:51.877
Uh, kind of.

06:51.879 --> 06:53.512
You all right?

06:53.514 --> 06:54.980
Oh, I-I'm fine, I'm fine.

06:54.982 --> 06:56.114
Steve, listen,
there's something going on

06:56.116 --> 06:57.516
that you need to know about,

06:57.518 --> 06:59.117
but, uh, I can't really
get into it

06:59.119 --> 07:00.752
over an open line.

07:00.754 --> 07:01.987
Catherine, what are
you talking about?

07:01.989 --> 07:04.990
I'll explain everything
in a minute.

07:10.564 --> 07:12.998
I couldn't decide.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.132
You okay?

07:16.670 --> 07:19.070
Yeah, um...

07:19.072 --> 07:20.105
something's going on.

07:20.107 --> 07:22.007
I'm not quite sure what it is.

07:22.009 --> 07:23.442
(knocking)

07:24.077 --> 07:25.710
You expecting someone?

07:25.712 --> 07:27.579
No, I wasn't, uh...

07:27.581 --> 07:28.980
She just decided to drop in.

07:28.982 --> 07:30.182
"She"?

07:30.184 --> 07:32.117
Catherine.

07:32.119 --> 07:33.885
"Catherine"?

07:33.887 --> 07:36.021
Like<i> Catherine,</i>
Catherine?

07:36.023 --> 07:38.123
Yeah, uh...

07:38.125 --> 07:41.860
I'm sorry, could you, uh,
excuse me for just a second?

07:50.804 --> 07:53.071
(sighs)
Hey.

07:53.073 --> 07:54.973
Hey.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.876
Come on in.

07:58.979 --> 08:00.045
Oh!

08:00.047 --> 08:01.246
Sorry.

08:01.248 --> 08:03.482
I didn't, um...

08:07.120 --> 08:08.787
Lynn, this is
Catherine.

08:08.789 --> 08:11.790
Catherine, Lynn.

08:11.792 --> 08:13.158
Hello.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.160
It's nice to meet you.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.996
I'm sorry to barge in like this,

08:17.998 --> 08:19.164
but it couldn't wait.
Okay.

08:19.166 --> 08:20.632
STEVE:
What's going on?

08:23.136 --> 08:24.703
It's about your mother.

08:26.206 --> 08:27.639
My mother?

08:27.641 --> 08:29.908
She's in trouble.

08:32.913 --> 08:35.981
<i> (Hawaii Five-O </i>
theme song plays)

09:05.312 --> 09:07.145
Okay, look, I know
I have a lot to explain

09:07.147 --> 09:10.582
with my leaving
the CIA, all of it.

09:10.584 --> 09:12.083
And-and that is
a conversation

09:12.085 --> 09:15.320
that I want to have with you.

09:15.322 --> 09:17.088
But we're really pressed

09:17.090 --> 09:18.290
for time here, so...
Yeah, yeah, all right.

09:18.292 --> 09:20.209
What's going on?

09:20.210 --> 09:22.127
All right, so,
last night, Doris

09:22.129 --> 09:25.564
tried to break Wo Fat's father
out of a CIA blacksite.

09:28.135 --> 09:29.868
The op went sideways.

09:29.870 --> 09:32.070
(grunts)

09:33.707 --> 09:35.340
Word is is that
they're holding her

09:35.342 --> 09:37.042
until they decide what
they're gonna do with her.

09:37.044 --> 09:39.811
And I'm trying to get
more information.

09:39.813 --> 09:42.113
No one's talking,
and I don't even know

09:42.115 --> 09:43.848
what country
the site is in.

09:43.850 --> 09:44.649
Morocco.

09:44.651 --> 09:46.685
I'm sorry?

09:46.687 --> 09:47.886
It's in Morocco.

09:47.888 --> 09:48.920
How would you know that?

09:48.922 --> 09:50.355
Because I've been there.

09:51.592 --> 09:53.124
<i> A couple of months ago,</i>
<i> I had a,</i>

09:53.126 --> 09:54.859
<i> a sit-down with Yao Fat.</i>

09:54.861 --> 09:57.245
<i> And now,</i>

09:57.246 --> 09:59.630
I'm realizing that Doris must
have orchestrated that meeting

09:59.633 --> 10:01.166
so she could
follow me out there

10:01.168 --> 10:02.601
and learn
the location of the site.

10:02.603 --> 10:05.203
She used me.

10:08.875 --> 10:10.709
We got to do something.

10:10.711 --> 10:12.711
We got to figure a way
to get her out of there.

10:12.713 --> 10:14.279
No way.

10:14.281 --> 10:16.281
Steve.

10:18.852 --> 10:22.253

22:54.006 --> 22:56.073
(guards shouting)

22:57.076 --> 22:58.509
GUARD:
Hey, get those generators going!

22:58.511 --> 23:01.045
Get the lights back on!

23:02.148 --> 23:04.448
Someone call Rogers
and see what's going on!

23:07.520 --> 23:09.153
(guards shouting)

23:16.162 --> 23:18.028
(guards shouting)

23:38.618 --> 23:40.718
Yeah, I've got nothing.

23:40.720 --> 23:43.454
Backup should kick in any sec.

23:50.797 --> 23:54.031
All right, buddy,
keep me posted.

23:54.033 --> 23:55.166
KONO:
Be aware.

23:55.168 --> 23:56.700
Backup generators coming on.

23:57.703 --> 23:59.570
There it is.

24:23.896 --> 24:25.463
All right,
Holloway said that

24:25.465 --> 24:26.931
Doris's cell was
in the next building over.

24:26.933 --> 24:29.200
Keys.

24:29.202 --> 24:30.234
There's your path

24:30.236 --> 24:31.235
right there.
STEVE: Yeah.

24:31.237 --> 24:32.603
All right, you guys keep an eye

24:32.605 --> 24:33.604
on these monitors,

24:33.606 --> 24:34.738
I'll go get Doris.

24:34.740 --> 24:36.507
Do me a favor,
tie this guy up.

24:39.078 --> 24:41.145
(guards shouting)

24:42.248 --> 24:44.615
CATHERINE:
Steve, hold your position.

25:06.038 --> 25:08.105
♪ ♪

25:29.295 --> 25:31.262
(grunts)

25:33.199 --> 25:34.865
(grunts)

25:40.540 --> 25:41.572
Hey, Mom.

25:41.574 --> 25:43.107
Steven.

25:43.108 --> 25:44.641
What the hell
are you doing here?!

25:44.644 --> 25:45.809
Gee, Ma, I don't know.

25:45.811 --> 25:47.278
Why don't you take a guess?

25:47.280 --> 25:48.746
You shouldn't have come.

25:48.748 --> 25:49.980
(groaning):
Oh, yeah, I'm starting

25:49.982 --> 25:51.148
to regret that myself now.

25:51.150 --> 25:52.283
Are you okay?

25:52.285 --> 25:54.652
(grunts)
Yeah.

25:54.654 --> 25:56.120
Yeah.

25:56.122 --> 25:57.922
I'll be fine.

25:57.924 --> 25:59.189
We got to get out of here.
We got to get out of here, yeah.

25:59.191 --> 26:02.893
Chin, Cath...
what's the word?

26:02.895 --> 26:03.994
Better hold your position.
There's another guard

26:03.996 --> 26:05.663
in the area.

26:05.665 --> 26:07.331
Copy that.
We got to sit tight.

26:07.333 --> 26:09.166
Wait, Chin and Catherine are here?
Yeah.

26:09.168 --> 26:10.200
And Kono and Lou Grover.

26:10.202 --> 26:11.835
Who's that?

26:11.837 --> 26:13.604
Oh, you haven't met Lou.
No.

26:13.606 --> 26:14.672
Great guy.
You'll love him.

26:14.674 --> 26:16.640
You brought
a lot of backup.

26:16.642 --> 26:18.175
Yeah, I did.

26:18.176 --> 26:19.709
Only an idiot would break
into this place alone.

26:19.712 --> 26:22.613
Okay, I deserve that.

26:29.221 --> 26:30.287
I'm sorry.

26:30.289 --> 26:31.355
I'll be fine, come on.

26:31.357 --> 26:34.058
Oh, no, I'm sorry for...

26:34.060 --> 26:35.092
(sighs)

26:35.094 --> 26:36.994
I should've told you
about Wo Fat.

26:36.996 --> 26:38.762
You know what, Ma?

26:38.764 --> 26:40.631
Not really the time for that talk.
It's the perfect time.

26:40.633 --> 26:42.666
I mean, we're both kind of
stuck here, right?

26:42.668 --> 26:44.201
Okay.

26:44.203 --> 26:47.338
Fine. Why didn't you tell me
about Wo Fat, Mom?

26:47.340 --> 26:48.372
Because I didn't

26:48.374 --> 26:49.707
think you'd understand and

26:49.709 --> 26:52.142
I was too afraid to find out.

26:52.144 --> 26:53.911
It was just easier
for me to go

26:53.913 --> 26:55.613
than to face you,
so I left.

26:55.615 --> 26:59.316
Went back to the only thing
I was ever really good at.

26:59.318 --> 27:02.086
And three years ago,
when you looked me in the eye

27:02.088 --> 27:04.822
and you promised me you'd stay,
but you left anyway,

27:04.824 --> 27:06.657
you knew you were gonna
do that, too, didn't you?

27:06.659 --> 27:08.058
Huh?

27:08.060 --> 27:09.727
You knew and I knew, too.

27:09.729 --> 27:11.695
You want to know how I knew?
No, how did you know?

27:11.697 --> 27:13.263
'Cause you did it exactly
the same way you did it

27:13.265 --> 27:15.899
all those years before when
you left me and Dad and Mary.

27:15.901 --> 27:18.669
Exactly the same way.

27:22.942 --> 27:24.041
Bye, mom.

27:24.043 --> 27:26.110
Bye.

27:31.250 --> 27:32.683
Steven, wait!

27:32.685 --> 27:34.118
What?

27:35.087 --> 27:37.287
Nothing, just... come here.

27:40.660 --> 27:42.393
(boys laughing)

27:47.800 --> 27:50.401
I love you
and I'm so proud of you.

27:50.403 --> 27:53.437
I love you, too, Mom.

28:02.748 --> 28:04.882
Yeah, I remember every second
of that day.

28:04.884 --> 28:06.450
All right?

28:06.452 --> 28:09.353
I thought it was gonna be
the last time I'd see you.

28:09.355 --> 28:10.688
It was the last time...

28:10.690 --> 28:13.023
for a really long time.

28:13.025 --> 28:16.026
(crying):
I'm sorry.

28:16.028 --> 28:17.461
I'm so sorry, Steven.

28:17.463 --> 28:19.730
I... for everything.

28:22.802 --> 28:24.702
(sniffles)

28:24.704 --> 28:25.703
It's all right, Ma.

28:29.008 --> 28:30.307
It's okay.

28:30.309 --> 28:31.842
And, uh...

28:31.844 --> 28:34.044
(whispering):
thank you for coming to get me.

28:35.748 --> 28:37.098
You're welcome.

28:37.099 --> 28:38.449
(whispering): Why don't you thank
me when we get out of here?

28:38.451 --> 28:39.750
Okay, I will.

28:42.354 --> 28:43.454
Put that on.

28:43.456 --> 28:44.822
Okay.
Chin, Cath,

28:44.824 --> 28:45.823
what's the word?

28:46.792 --> 28:47.825
All clear.

28:47.827 --> 28:48.926
STEVE:
All right, everybody,

28:48.928 --> 28:50.027
exfil in 90 seconds.

28:50.029 --> 28:51.028
Roger that.

28:51.030 --> 28:51.962
But wait, wait, wait.

28:51.964 --> 28:53.497
We can't leave yet.

28:53.499 --> 28:54.865
What are you talking about?

28:54.867 --> 28:56.500
Yao. We have to take him with us.
Hey, hey.

28:56.502 --> 28:58.769
I came here for you
and I got you.

28:58.771 --> 28:59.870
And I came for him.

28:59.872 --> 29:01.138
And you failed,
which is why I'm here.

29:01.140 --> 29:02.506
We got to go.
I'm not going anywhere.

29:02.508 --> 29:05.242
Mom.
No, listen to me.

29:05.244 --> 29:06.544
(whispering):
That man lost his family.

29:06.545 --> 29:07.845
He lost the last 20 years
of his life.

29:07.847 --> 29:09.080
He's suffered enough.

29:09.081 --> 29:10.314
I am not leaving
him behind.

29:10.316 --> 29:11.348
Mom.

29:11.350 --> 29:13.050
I'm not going.

29:13.052 --> 29:14.118
You're impossible. Impossible.

29:38.811 --> 29:40.911
STEVE:
Hey, man.

29:40.913 --> 29:42.079
What are you
still doing here?

29:42.081 --> 29:43.480
I thought you were
gonna rotate out.

29:43.482 --> 29:44.782
What are you talking about?

29:44.784 --> 29:45.916
Who sent you?

29:45.918 --> 29:47.785
What's that?
I said

29:47.787 --> 29:48.886
who sent you?

29:48.888 --> 29:50.320
Would you mind
lowering that thing?

29:50.322 --> 29:52.022
Oh, yeah, sure, no problem.

29:52.024 --> 29:53.991
Put your hands where
I can see them.

29:53.993 --> 29:55.793
Lower your weapon.
Put it on the ground.

29:55.795 --> 29:57.861
Slowly.

29:59.331 --> 30:00.898
Stand up.

30:00.900 --> 30:01.932
Hands behind your head.

30:01.934 --> 30:03.233
Interlock your fingers.

30:03.235 --> 30:04.568
Turn around.
Face the wall.

30:04.570 --> 30:06.236
Turn around.

30:32.498 --> 30:35.365
I didn't think
I would ever see you again.

30:35.367 --> 30:38.402
I never stopped looking for you.

30:40.606 --> 30:41.605
STEVE:
Get in there.

30:41.607 --> 30:43.207
Against the left wall,
right here.

30:43.209 --> 30:44.241
Get on your knees.

30:44.243 --> 30:45.375
On your knees.

30:45.377 --> 30:47.611
Cover him, Ma, cover him.

30:49.215 --> 30:50.881
What are you doing?

30:50.883 --> 30:53.116
I got no zip ties.

30:53.118 --> 30:54.585
What, seriously?

30:54.587 --> 30:55.986
You didn't
bring restraints

30:55.988 --> 30:57.287
and you've been on
how many ops now?

30:57.289 --> 30:58.589
You know what, Ma?

30:58.591 --> 30:59.923
I thought I was coming in,

30:59.925 --> 31:01.491
getting you and getting out,
okay?

31:01.493 --> 31:02.759
I didn't think

31:02.760 --> 31:04.026
I was gonna be tying up
bad guys,

31:04.029 --> 31:05.596
all right?
Who raised you?

31:07.199 --> 31:09.099
CATHERINE:
Guys, we got a problem.

31:10.402 --> 31:12.169
There's a guard
in Doris's cell.

31:14.006 --> 31:16.540
He's calling it in.

31:18.510 --> 31:19.543
We need to get
out of here now.

31:19.545 --> 31:22.012
(alarm blaring)

31:22.014 --> 31:23.547
Come on,
let's go. Go.

31:23.549 --> 31:25.916
I want this place locked down!

31:25.918 --> 31:27.050
Let's go!

31:31.924 --> 31:33.090
GROVER:
I hate to state the obvious,

31:33.092 --> 31:35.392
but, uh, this is bad.

31:37.930 --> 31:39.997
(guards shouting)

31:42.368 --> 31:45.535
Chin, Cath, they're probably
on their way to you.

31:45.537 --> 31:47.170
Abandon your position right now.

31:47.172 --> 31:48.238
We're already
on our way out.

31:48.240 --> 31:49.206
What about you guys?

31:49.208 --> 31:50.641
DORIS:
Don't worry.

31:50.643 --> 31:51.642
I have a plan.

31:51.644 --> 31:53.577
You have a plan?
Yeah.

31:53.579 --> 31:54.978
Contrary to what
you might think,

31:54.980 --> 31:56.513
I didn't just show up here
and wing it.

31:56.515 --> 31:58.415
I had an exit strategy.

31:58.417 --> 31:59.616
Okay.
Okay.

31:59.618 --> 32:00.684
Chin and Catherine,

32:00.686 --> 32:01.919
can you guys make it

32:01.921 --> 32:03.487
to the north tower?

32:03.489 --> 32:04.521
I think so, why?

32:04.523 --> 32:05.956
On my way in, I hid a small

32:05.958 --> 32:07.457
C-4 charge inside

32:07.459 --> 32:08.692
an electrical panel.

32:08.694 --> 32:10.260
Copy that.
We're on our way.

32:10.262 --> 32:11.428
I was gonna trigger it

32:11.430 --> 32:13.263
to create a distraction,
get the guards

32:13.265 --> 32:14.965
running one way,
while Yao and I went the other.

32:14.967 --> 32:16.266
Yeah, that's great, Ma.

32:16.268 --> 32:17.601
I don't think that
plan's gonna work now.

32:17.603 --> 32:19.169
No, but if we can get
our hands on that explosive,

32:19.171 --> 32:20.971
we can use it to dynamite
our way out of here.

32:20.973 --> 32:22.940
How do you figure?

32:22.942 --> 32:25.542
One level down on the east side,
there's an old sewer tunnel

32:25.544 --> 32:27.344
that was sealed off years ago.

32:27.346 --> 32:28.378
Goes all the way to the river.

32:28.380 --> 32:30.314
If we can retrieve that charge,

32:30.316 --> 32:31.381
we can maybe blast it open.

32:31.383 --> 32:32.649
I figure we'll have

32:32.651 --> 32:36.620
30 seconds tops
before the guards show up.

32:36.622 --> 32:38.689
(alarm continues wailing)

32:55.708 --> 32:57.374
Let's go.

32:57.376 --> 33:00.744
(men yelling indistinctly)

33:00.746 --> 33:02.746
GUARD:
Freeze right there!

33:02.748 --> 33:04.715
All right, all right.

33:04.717 --> 33:05.983
All right, all right!
(guns cocking)

33:21.100 --> 33:22.165
How many are with you?

33:24.136 --> 33:26.103
I came alone.

33:26.105 --> 33:29.272
Put him in the chair.

33:29.274 --> 33:33.210
I take it you're familiar
with this process.

33:33.212 --> 33:35.178
I've never been on the
receiving end of it myself,

33:35.180 --> 33:38.081
but it always looks
quite unpleasant.

33:38.083 --> 33:41.084
No, it's not too bad.

33:41.086 --> 33:43.286
Let's get started.

33:43.288 --> 33:44.421
I'll ask you again.

33:44.423 --> 33:46.623
How many are with you?

33:46.625 --> 33:49.326
(distant grunting,
blows landing)

33:49.328 --> 33:51.061
Looks like you're about
to find out.

33:51.063 --> 33:52.262
(men grunting)

33:57.169 --> 33:59.403
(gun cocks)
Stay down, stay down.

33:59.405 --> 34:00.437
Don't move.

34:00.439 --> 34:01.805
You must be insane if you think

34:01.807 --> 34:03.273
you're just gonna
walk out of here.

34:03.275 --> 34:05.142
Yeah, we'll see.
(door opens)

34:05.144 --> 34:07.744
STEVE:
Hey.

34:07.746 --> 34:09.613
Hey.
Thought you needed some help.

34:09.615 --> 34:10.814
We did.

34:10.816 --> 34:12.282
Two minutes ago.
Let's go, Ma.

34:12.284 --> 34:14.084
Out, out, out, out.

34:14.086 --> 34:16.153
Out.
Don't move.

34:20.259 --> 34:21.391
Hello, Mrs. McGarrett.

34:21.393 --> 34:24.161
Nice to see you again.

34:24.163 --> 34:25.095
Did you find the charge?

34:25.097 --> 34:26.129
Right where you said.

34:26.131 --> 34:27.230
Let's go.

34:30.569 --> 34:33.203
This way!

34:39.645 --> 34:40.577
Give me the charge.

34:43.582 --> 34:46.483
Do not let them leave the
premises! Let's go! Go, go!

34:47.686 --> 34:49.286
Okay, go, find cover.

34:49.288 --> 34:50.554
Let's go, take
cover, guys, go, go, go.

34:52.191 --> 34:54.224
(beeps)

34:57.262 --> 34:58.562
(beeps)

34:58.564 --> 35:00.130
Let's go, Ma.

35:06.305 --> 35:08.238
(detonator blips)

35:24.289 --> 35:27.157
You, uh, you sure
this is gonna work?

35:27.159 --> 35:29.226
There are a lot of
secrets in that man's head.

35:29.228 --> 35:30.193
A lot of people at the CIA

35:30.195 --> 35:31.828
who still consider him a threat.

35:31.830 --> 35:34.865
It's why they've kept
him locked up all this time.

35:34.867 --> 35:38.602
So, long as he's out
there, they can't touch me.

35:38.604 --> 35:40.504
Or any of you guys
for that matter.

35:40.506 --> 35:42.506
All right.

35:42.508 --> 35:44.174
So, uh, what happens after that?

35:44.176 --> 35:45.542
Then what?

35:45.544 --> 35:48.378
Then I'll be able to come home.

35:48.380 --> 35:50.213
Oh. Okay.

35:50.215 --> 35:51.748
Seriously, I might...

35:51.749 --> 35:53.282
even get a place just
down the street from you.

35:53.285 --> 35:56.253
Oh, trust me, you are never
gonna be able get rid of me.

35:56.255 --> 35:57.254
I bet.

35:57.256 --> 35:59.890
(laughing):
Come here.

36:11.537 --> 36:15.639
I want you to know that...

36:15.641 --> 36:19.609
everything I did,
every decision...

36:19.611 --> 36:21.311
I made them for
the right reasons.

36:21.313 --> 36:22.579
I-- no, no, listen.

36:22.581 --> 36:24.781
I, at least I thought
so at the time.

36:24.783 --> 36:26.383
You know?

36:26.385 --> 36:29.953
But if you ever want
to know more about me,

36:29.955 --> 36:33.456
about who I was before,

36:33.458 --> 36:35.592
the answers are...

36:35.594 --> 36:38.228
waiting for you at home.

36:38.230 --> 36:41.364
What do you mean?

36:41.366 --> 36:43.567
Ten paces from the
far wall in the study,

36:43.569 --> 36:44.868
there's a loose floorboard.

36:44.870 --> 36:46.603
Under that, there's a lock-box.

36:46.605 --> 36:50.640
The combination is 90268.

36:50.642 --> 36:55.278
Inside... you'll
find all the answers.

36:58.650 --> 37:00.483
Take care of yourself.

37:00.485 --> 37:02.552
Okay?

37:05.524 --> 37:06.590
What?

37:09.328 --> 37:10.961
Being a spy wasn't
the only thing

37:10.963 --> 37:13.763
you were ever good at, Mom.

37:22.741 --> 37:25.875
I love you.

37:37.656 --> 37:40.207
Hey.

37:40.208 --> 37:42.759
So, uh, I'm gonna be
hitching a ride with them.

37:42.761 --> 37:44.794
I got a... a new assignment,

37:44.796 --> 37:47.297
and Doris is gonna
drop me off on the way.

37:47.299 --> 37:48.365
Do me a favor,
tell me something.

37:48.367 --> 37:51.001
What's that?

37:51.003 --> 37:52.702
Are you happy?

37:52.704 --> 37:56.506
Doing what you're doing?

37:56.508 --> 37:58.808
Yeah.

37:58.810 --> 38:01.478
I am.

38:01.480 --> 38:03.780
All right, good.

38:03.782 --> 38:05.515

I'm not in your life,

38:21.867 --> 38:25.402
doesn't mean I don't still
care about you.

38:29.975 --> 38:32.909

38:54.366 --> 38:55.865
It was a, it was an accident.

38:55.867 --> 38:56.933
She didn't mean to.

39:00.572 --> 39:03.807
I'm sorry.

39:08.914 --> 39:12.682
Just, uh, you know,
out of curiosity,

39:12.684 --> 39:16.519
if I'd have asked,
what would you have said?

39:19.491 --> 39:23.560
I would've said yes.

39:38.610 --> 39:39.843
Hey.

39:39.845 --> 39:43.113
Lynn...

39:43.115 --> 39:45.582
