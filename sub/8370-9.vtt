01:01.113 --> 01:03.081
_

01:20.490 --> 01:21.573
Hyena attack!

01:21.624 --> 01:22.741
Hyena attack?

01:22.792 --> 01:23.876
Hyena attack?

01:23.910 --> 01:25.878
Hyena attack!

01:25.912 --> 01:28.830
Panic and run!
Panic and run!

01:33.753 --> 01:35.637
Everybody calm down!

01:35.672 --> 01:37.756
Who saw the hyenas?
Where are they?

01:37.807 --> 01:39.758
In, in the grass!

01:41.428 --> 01:43.478
Hyenas! We know
you're in there!

01:44.764 --> 01:46.682
Lion Guard,
spread out!

01:46.733 --> 01:48.517
You're surrounded,
hyenas!

01:49.770 --> 01:51.436
Come on out!

01:54.908 --> 01:57.659
Don't hurt us!
We're not really hyenas!

01:57.694 --> 02:00.445
Uh, yeah.
We can see that.

02:00.496 --> 02:03.448
Why were you
trying to scare everybody?

02:03.450 --> 02:05.784
We weren't! We were
just playing Lion Guard!

02:05.835 --> 02:08.419
Playing Lion Guard?

02:08.454 --> 02:10.405
And it was our turn
to be the bad guys!

02:10.455 --> 02:11.673
It was all
Mtoto's idea!

02:13.459 --> 02:14.626
Are you Mtoto?

02:15.712 --> 02:17.846
Mmm-hmm.

02:17.880 --> 02:19.615
Ono, want to give
the all clear?

02:19.649 --> 02:21.550
Affirmative.

02:22.769 --> 02:25.637
False alarm everyone!
No hyenas here!

02:25.688 --> 02:27.389
- Kids!
- Really!

02:27.440 --> 02:29.808
So you guys were pretending
to be the Lion Guard?

02:29.810 --> 02:33.478
Oh, yeah! We each take turns
being different members!

02:33.529 --> 02:36.531
Except Mtoto,
he's always Beshte!

02:36.566 --> 02:38.817
Really? Me? Poa!

02:38.819 --> 02:40.619
Who gets to pretend to be me?

02:40.653 --> 02:42.821
You know,
whoever is last.

02:42.872 --> 02:44.539
Say what?

02:44.574 --> 02:45.824
Well, little Lion Guard,

02:45.875 --> 02:48.877
this isn't the best time
to pretend to be hyenas.

02:48.911 --> 02:52.664
I saw Janja and his hyenas sneaking
into the Pride Lands yesterday.

02:52.715 --> 02:54.583
And they're still
around here...

02:54.634 --> 02:55.667
Somewhere.

02:55.718 --> 02:58.503
So you can see
why everyone got so upset.

02:58.554 --> 03:00.472
We never meant
to scare anybody!

03:00.506 --> 03:02.591
We won't do it again!
Promise!

03:03.843 --> 03:05.510
Hi, little guy.

03:08.815 --> 03:11.683
Uh... Did you want
to ask me something?

03:11.685 --> 03:12.684
Uh...

03:12.735 --> 03:13.852
How's it feel
to be so strong?

03:13.854 --> 03:15.570
What's it like
to fight bad guys?

03:15.605 --> 03:17.572
Can you really knock down
a tree with your head?

03:17.607 --> 03:19.574
How's it feel to
be a real live hero?

03:20.693 --> 03:23.445
Oh, well,
I'm not really.

03:23.496 --> 03:25.530
It's the whole team.
Not just me.

03:25.581 --> 03:29.701
Hey! Maybe the real Lion Guard
could play Lion Guard with us!

03:31.705 --> 03:32.838
Sounds like fun.

03:32.872 --> 03:34.623
But with hyenas on the loose,

03:34.674 --> 03:36.425
we need to stay sharp.

03:36.459 --> 03:38.427
Lion Guard!
Time for some training.

03:38.461 --> 03:39.878
<i>- Sounds good!
- Zuka Zama!</i>

03:41.764 --> 03:43.882
Well, I'd better
get going.

03:43.884 --> 03:45.550
Aw.

03:45.552 --> 03:47.719
Can't you stay just
a little longer, Beshte?

03:47.721 --> 03:48.804
Please?

03:48.855 --> 03:50.722
Hmm.

03:50.773 --> 03:53.558
Say, Mtoto, how'd you like
to come watch us train?

03:53.560 --> 03:56.445
Poa! That'd be awesome!

03:56.479 --> 03:59.448
Okay! C'mon,
Mtoto, let's go!

04:00.650 --> 04:02.401
I can't believe it.

04:02.452 --> 04:05.704
I'm gonna train with
the real live Lion Guard!

04:05.738 --> 04:08.407
So you really do like
the Lion Guard, huh?

04:08.409 --> 04:10.625
Who doesn't?
You guys are the greatest!

04:10.660 --> 04:12.577
Kion is a great leader.

04:12.628 --> 04:14.746
And Fuli's just so fast!

04:14.748 --> 04:17.632
Bunga's not afraid
of anything. And Ono...

04:17.666 --> 04:20.502
But you're the biggest
reason I like the Lion Guard!

04:20.553 --> 04:22.721
Well, I guess
I am the biggest...

04:22.755 --> 04:24.756
Not like that, Beshte.

04:24.807 --> 04:26.842
I think you're the best!

04:26.893 --> 04:29.761
Uh, well... Thanks.

04:29.812 --> 04:31.646
I don't know what to say.

04:31.681 --> 04:32.848
Hey, look!

04:32.899 --> 04:36.485
There's Kion and the others!
Come on!

04:36.519 --> 04:39.771
We need to be ready to chase
down Janja wherever we find him.

04:39.773 --> 04:42.774
I'm always ready.

04:42.776 --> 04:44.860
Hey, guys.
Sorry I'm late.

04:44.911 --> 04:48.780
I, uh, invited Mtoto
to come along.

04:48.831 --> 04:50.449
Okay.

04:50.451 --> 04:52.784
Well, we were just about
to run an obstacle course.

04:52.835 --> 04:55.504
Poa! Can I run it, too?
Whoa!

04:55.538 --> 04:57.789
Sure, I guess.

04:57.791 --> 04:59.591
Stick with him, Beshte.

04:59.625 --> 05:02.461
Ono, keep an eye out for hyenas
while we're running this one.

05:02.463 --> 05:03.712
Affirmative!

05:03.763 --> 05:06.465
The sky's probably
the safest place to be.

05:06.467 --> 05:07.632
Everybody follow me!

05:10.803 --> 05:12.687
Boulder jump! Go!

05:14.524 --> 05:15.640
<i>Zuka Zama!</i>

05:20.530 --> 05:22.364
I usually just
run around 'em!

05:22.398 --> 05:24.733
Oh! Uh, okay!

05:24.784 --> 05:26.485
You're gonna
love this, Fuli.

05:27.570 --> 05:28.620
Argh!

05:35.545 --> 05:37.546
You'll do anything to
stay dry, won't you?

05:37.580 --> 05:38.747
You know it.

05:38.798 --> 05:40.415
<i>Zuka Zama!</i>

05:43.553 --> 05:46.505
Huh. Not as deep
as I thought.

05:46.556 --> 05:48.507
Whoa!

05:55.765 --> 05:59.568
Oh, no!
I'm, I'm sorry!

05:59.602 --> 06:03.355
Yeah, well...
it's just water.

06:03.357 --> 06:05.524
Told you the sky was
the safest place to be.

06:05.575 --> 06:08.693
Yeah, why don't we try
something totally different.

06:08.695 --> 06:10.445
Oh, okay!

06:10.496 --> 06:12.447
I'll do a lot better
this time! You'll see!

06:12.498 --> 06:14.366
Sure you will, Mtoto.

06:16.416 --> 06:19.201
Hmm, let's run
a stealth surround drill.

06:19.252 --> 06:21.286
Yeah, yeah!
Where we practice sneaking up

06:21.337 --> 06:23.372
on bad guys and
surround them.

06:23.374 --> 06:26.208
- Haven't done that in a while.
- Sounds good to me.

06:26.210 --> 06:28.343
I always ace this one.

06:28.378 --> 06:31.296
Okay, I'll go to the other
side of that big rock pile.

06:31.347 --> 06:33.215
The rest of you try to sneak up,

06:33.266 --> 06:35.217
without me seeing or hearing you.

06:35.219 --> 06:38.303
Ono? Keep watch for hyenas
while we're running this one?

06:38.354 --> 06:39.296
Affirmative!

06:40.053 --> 06:42.271
You know the drill.
Wait till I'm out of sight.

06:42.305 --> 06:45.190
- Then try to surround me.
- You got it, Kion.

06:48.394 --> 06:50.362
Okay.
I'll approach from this side.

06:50.396 --> 06:53.148
You two go in from that side.

06:53.199 --> 06:55.450
Kion'll never see me coming!

06:55.485 --> 06:58.320
Sneaking up on someone
isn't so easy for us hippos.

06:58.371 --> 06:59.488
Unless we're in the water.

06:59.539 --> 07:01.323
Aw, you'll be great at it!

07:01.374 --> 07:03.075
You can do anything!

07:03.126 --> 07:04.326
I don't know about that,

07:04.377 --> 07:07.045
but we'll give it
our very best try!

07:20.476 --> 07:23.395
Hey, Kion, how's it going?

07:23.429 --> 07:26.431
Got me.
You're good, Fuli.

07:26.482 --> 07:28.400
I know.

07:28.434 --> 07:30.319
Walk softly...

07:30.353 --> 07:32.020
Easy does it...

07:39.245 --> 07:40.445
I don't think Kion heard.

07:40.447 --> 07:42.030
Let's keep moving.

07:44.500 --> 07:47.202
Hey, Beshte, what about going this way?

07:52.342 --> 07:53.458
<i>Zuka Zama!</i>

07:55.378 --> 07:57.095
Gotcha!

07:57.130 --> 08:00.132
Bunga, what happened
to sneaking up on me?

08:00.134 --> 08:02.050
Eh, I got
tired of that!

08:02.101 --> 08:04.219
Running right at ya's more my style.

08:04.270 --> 08:06.221
So, that just
leaves Beshte.

08:06.272 --> 08:07.472
And Mtoto.

08:09.309 --> 08:12.144
You're really good at this, Mtoto.

08:12.195 --> 08:14.146
I can't even hear you.

08:16.115 --> 08:17.149
Mtoto?

08:18.401 --> 08:20.285
Guys, guys!

08:20.320 --> 08:21.370
Beshte?
What's wrong?

08:21.404 --> 08:24.323
It's Mtoto! I can't
find him anywhere!

08:24.325 --> 08:26.074
I'm right here, Beshte!

08:26.125 --> 08:27.492
I was just sneaking, uh...

08:27.494 --> 08:30.245
- Mtoto!
- Whoa!

08:30.296 --> 08:32.381
Hang on, Mtoto!
I'm coming!

08:32.414 --> 08:33.498
Oh...

08:33.500 --> 08:35.217
It's not gonna hold.

08:38.505 --> 08:41.390
Mtoto, are you okay?

08:41.424 --> 08:43.174
I think so...

08:43.177 --> 08:46.261
I'm okay too.

08:46.312 --> 08:48.480
Mtoto? Why didn't
you stay with me?

08:48.514 --> 08:50.515
I wanted to show you
I could do a good job

08:50.517 --> 08:52.351
sneaking up on Kion.

08:52.353 --> 08:54.186
Sorry, I messed up.

08:54.237 --> 08:56.188
Again.

08:56.190 --> 08:58.240
We're just glad
you're not hurt, Mtoto.

08:58.274 --> 09:01.076
But I think it's time
for you to head home.

09:01.110 --> 09:03.028
Yeah. I guess so.

09:03.079 --> 09:04.363
I'll walk you.

09:04.365 --> 09:06.248
Okay.

09:06.282 --> 09:08.250
Bye, everybody.

09:13.373 --> 09:15.374
I don't think he saw us.

09:16.292 --> 09:19.011
Yeowch! Watch it!

09:19.045 --> 09:21.463
But he could still
hear us, fur brain!

09:21.514 --> 09:23.215
Yeah!

09:23.266 --> 09:26.468
They don't call Ono "The
ears in the sky" for nothin'!

09:26.519 --> 09:29.221
That's not what
they call him!

09:29.223 --> 09:30.272
They don't?

09:30.306 --> 09:32.474
Come on.

09:32.525 --> 09:35.027
Sorry, you had
to rescue me.

09:35.061 --> 09:37.112
Well, I should've
kept an eye on you.

09:37.146 --> 09:39.448
But you're okay.
And that's what counts.

09:39.482 --> 09:42.367
I really messed up, didn't I?

09:42.402 --> 09:45.454
It was your first time training
with the Lion Guard, Mtoto.

09:45.488 --> 09:47.406
You'll get better
if you keep practicing.

09:47.457 --> 09:49.241

<i> # It's there within you #</i>

11:50.196 --> 11:52.280
<i> # Your hero inside #</i>

11:52.331 --> 11:54.249
<i> # Just look within you #</i>

11:54.283 --> 11:56.501
<i> # Your hero inside #</i>

11:56.536 --> 11:58.253
<i> # No need to worry #</i>

11:58.287 --> 12:00.505
<i> # Hold your head up with pride #</i>

12:00.540 --> 12:02.457
<i> # Believe in yourself #</i>

12:02.508 --> 12:05.177
<i> # There's no need to hide #</i>

12:05.211 --> 12:07.429
<i> # It's there within you #</i>

12:07.463 --> 12:11.584
<i> # Your hero inside #</i>

12:12.218 --> 12:15.387
<i> # Your hero inside #</i>

12:17.557 --> 12:21.109
So you really think I have
what it takes to be a hero?

12:21.143 --> 12:23.278
Sure! Just don't give up.

12:23.312 --> 12:25.113
You've already
got some moves!

12:25.147 --> 12:26.314
I do?

12:26.365 --> 12:29.117
Like that water spraying thing
you did with your trunk?

12:29.151 --> 12:31.069
Seriously poa!

12:31.071 --> 12:33.371
- Really?
- Oh, yeah!

12:33.406 --> 12:36.408
Just, uh, be sure to use it
on bad guys from now on!

12:36.459 --> 12:39.127
Thanks, Beshte. I will!

12:39.462 --> 12:41.129
And who knows?

12:41.163 --> 12:43.415
Maybe you'll join the
real Lion Guard someday.

12:43.466 --> 12:47.135
- When you're older.
- Wow!

12:47.169 --> 12:50.088
I-I'd better head back.
Take care, Mtoto.

12:50.139 --> 12:51.423
Bye, Beshte!

12:51.425 --> 12:53.308
Mtoto, where've you been?

12:53.342 --> 12:56.261
Oh, you know.
Training. With Beshte.

12:56.312 --> 12:57.395
And the Lion Guard.

12:57.430 --> 13:00.181
Wow!
 Did they make you a member?

13:00.233 --> 13:02.434
Not officially, but...

13:02.485 --> 13:06.438
So you probably don't want to play
pretend Lion Guard anymore, huh?

13:06.489 --> 13:08.273
You kidding?

13:08.324 --> 13:11.076
Beshte said I should
keep practicing my moves!

13:11.110 --> 13:13.161
Let's play right now!
I'll be...

13:13.195 --> 13:14.446
<i>Beshte!</i>

13:14.497 --> 13:18.033
- We know, we know!
- Wait'll I show you this great trick

13:18.084 --> 13:20.085
I came up with when I was
training with the Guard!

13:20.119 --> 13:24.339
Till the Pride Lands end,
Lion Guard defend!

13:24.373 --> 13:26.291
<i>Twende kiboko!</i>

13:26.293 --> 13:28.376
<i>Zuka Zama!</i>

13:29.211 --> 13:32.264
<i>- Hapana!
- Huwezi!</i>

13:32.298 --> 13:34.299
<i>Heyvi kabisa!</i>

13:36.136 --> 13:39.220
Gosh! This isn't
as much fun as usual.

13:39.272 --> 13:42.357
Yeah, 'cause we promised
not to be hyenas.

13:42.391 --> 13:44.526
It's always more fun
with somebody to chase.

13:44.560 --> 13:47.312
Maybe we can't be
the hyenas...

13:47.314 --> 13:49.064
But they can!

13:49.115 --> 13:50.532
<i>Yeah!</i>

13:53.286 --> 13:55.487
Yeah, you better run,
you bad guys!

13:55.538 --> 13:58.406
You won't get away
from me, Janja!

13:58.457 --> 14:02.098
Huh?
 Somebody call my name?

14:02.495 --> 14:05.330
Hey, boys.
Look what we have here.

14:05.381 --> 14:09.134
Appetizers!

14:09.168 --> 14:12.003
Yeah! Bite-sized!

14:14.507 --> 14:16.474
Great job on the obstacle course!

14:16.509 --> 14:19.010
Now time for some speed training!

14:19.061 --> 14:22.097
On your mark, get set... Go!

14:26.352 --> 14:29.020
Whoo! I can't
believe I beat her!

14:29.071 --> 14:31.156
Um... Actually,
you didn't.

14:31.190 --> 14:32.357
Huh?

14:32.359 --> 14:35.243
Did you really think
you were faster than me?

14:35.277 --> 14:37.078
Well...

14:37.113 --> 14:39.280
As long as you're both
faster than the hyenas,

14:39.332 --> 14:40.498
I'm good.

14:40.533 --> 14:42.334
Speaking
of hyenas...

14:42.368 --> 14:44.452
Ono, could you take another look around?

14:44.503 --> 14:46.287
You bet!
Thanks!

14:46.339 --> 14:49.040
Oh, and maybe look for
Beshte while you're up there?

14:49.091 --> 14:52.093
Good idea! He should've
gotten back by now!

14:52.128 --> 14:56.097
I mean, how long can it take
to walk a little elephant home?

14:56.132 --> 14:58.383
What is the point of living
in the Pride Lands,

14:58.434 --> 15:01.136
if we have to run from
hyenas all the time?

15:01.187 --> 15:02.387
I mean, really!

15:02.438 --> 15:04.022
Don't worry.

15:04.056 --> 15:05.440
The Lion Guard
is on the job.

15:05.474 --> 15:07.108
We'll find those hyenas

15:07.143 --> 15:09.144
and chase them back
where they belong!

15:11.447 --> 15:13.231
I'm gonna get you, Janja!

15:13.282 --> 15:16.034
You, too, Cheezi and Chungu!

15:16.068 --> 15:21.239
- Wait. Are they really chasing us?
- Huh? I hope not!

15:21.290 --> 15:24.325
Fur brains!
They're playing pretend!

15:24.377 --> 15:28.213
But it's about to get real.
C'mon.

15:32.468 --> 15:34.419
Argh! They got away!

15:34.470 --> 15:37.305
- What do you want to chase now?
- I got an idea!

15:37.339 --> 15:40.225
How's about we chase you?

15:40.259 --> 15:42.143
<i> Hyenas! Ah!</i>

15:52.521 --> 15:54.189
Jump on me!

15:56.275 --> 15:59.277
Ow! No fair. Kicking!

15:59.328 --> 16:03.198
Just you and me now, kid!

16:06.252 --> 16:07.452
Boulder escape training.

16:11.458 --> 16:14.092
Janja! They're
gettin' away!

16:14.126 --> 16:16.428
And that little
zebra's mean!

16:16.462 --> 16:17.462
Doesn't matter.

16:17.513 --> 16:20.014
There's still
the little elephant.

16:20.049 --> 16:23.051
And he's the slowest one.

16:25.387 --> 16:28.389
Seriously. There's no
reason to be afraid.

16:28.441 --> 16:29.474
Maybe not for them!

16:29.525 --> 16:32.193
But zebras are the
most delicious animals

16:32.228 --> 16:35.063
in the Pride Lands and
the hyenas know it!

16:36.198 --> 16:38.316
It's true.
Deal with it.

16:38.318 --> 16:40.151
<i>Beshte! Beshte!</i>

16:40.153 --> 16:42.203
We need your help!
Please!

16:42.238 --> 16:44.322
Whoa, kids!
What's the kerbubble?

16:44.324 --> 16:46.074
And where's Mtoto?

16:46.125 --> 16:49.327
Mtoto's being chased! 
By the hyenas!

16:49.378 --> 16:52.163
Oh, not again!

16:52.165 --> 16:54.382
Don't listen to these
little troublemakers!

16:54.416 --> 16:57.385
This time it's true!
Mtoto's in danger!

16:57.419 --> 16:59.337
And he's all alone!

16:59.388 --> 17:02.056
Not for long!
Stay here!

17:02.091 --> 17:06.060
Oh, now, really!
Who's going to protect me?

17:19.407 --> 17:21.242
Well? Anything?

17:21.277 --> 17:23.494
Well, the good news is,
I didn't see any hyenas.

17:23.529 --> 17:27.031
The bad news is,
I also didn't see Beshte.

17:27.082 --> 17:28.333
Hmm.

17:28.367 --> 17:31.419
It's not like Beshte to
wander off when we're on alert.

17:31.453 --> 17:33.121
Something's wrong.

17:33.172 --> 17:35.039
C'mon. We've
gotta find him.

17:36.458 --> 17:40.512
Won't be long now.
He's getting tired.

17:40.546 --> 17:43.181
Me, too!

17:43.215 --> 17:45.183
All right, fellas.
Let's get him.

17:50.105 --> 17:53.057
Hey, little buddy!
Looking for help?

17:53.108 --> 17:56.060
It's no use.
Nobody's coming.

17:56.062 --> 17:58.530
Just you and us.

17:58.564 --> 18:02.233
So which do you prefer, boys?
Leg or trunk?

18:02.284 --> 18:07.071
I like the ears!
They're chewier!

18:07.122 --> 18:10.325
Chewy ears!
That sounds funny!

18:11.611 --> 18:14.078
And delicious!

18:14.296 --> 18:15.997
Uh...

18:16.465 --> 18:18.333
<i>Twende kiboko!</i>

18:21.170 --> 18:23.388
Beshte!
You came for me!

18:23.422 --> 18:26.007
Sure, I did!
You can swim, right?

18:26.058 --> 18:29.310
- Mom hasn't taught me yet.
- Then hop up!

18:29.345 --> 18:31.012
Now hang on!

18:33.399 --> 18:36.150
What do we do now?

18:36.185 --> 18:37.435
Follow that hippo!

18:40.272 --> 18:42.023
I don't see Beshte anywhere.

18:42.074 --> 18:44.025
Or his little elephant buddy.

18:44.076 --> 18:45.443
Aren't those Mtoto's friends?

18:47.413 --> 18:49.113
Have you guys seen Beshte?

18:49.164 --> 18:52.033
- He went to save Mtoto!
- From the hyenas!

18:52.084 --> 18:53.201
- What?
- Where?

18:53.252 --> 18:56.421
That way! Janja and
the hyenas chased us!

18:56.455 --> 18:59.123
We got away but Mtoto didn't!

18:59.174 --> 19:01.960
- Ono, we have to find them!
- I'm on it!

19:08.467 --> 19:11.436
C'mon, boys!
We're catching them!

19:12.438 --> 19:14.355
Hey! They passed us!

19:14.390 --> 19:16.357
Maybe they're just going
in the same direction!

19:18.060 --> 19:21.145
- Or maybe not?
- Mtoto, duck!

19:24.483 --> 19:26.234
Uh-oh!

19:26.285 --> 19:30.204
Here dinner, dinner, dinner...

19:30.239 --> 19:32.123
Whoa!

19:33.158 --> 19:36.127
Whoa!
That was awesome!

19:38.080 --> 19:39.464
The current's slower through here.

19:39.498 --> 19:43.334
I should be able to make better time.
Almost home, Mtoto!

19:43.336 --> 19:45.420
Uh-oh! Look!

19:45.471 --> 19:49.090
- What do we do now?
- I've got an idea.

19:55.147 --> 19:56.180
<i>Hapana!</i>

19:56.231 --> 19:58.349
Crocodiles ahead!
Hyenas behind!

19:58.351 --> 20:00.101
That's never a good thing!

20:00.152 --> 20:02.115
I need to tell the rest of the guard.

20:02.521 --> 20:07.075
- Mtoto, ready for stealth mode?
- You bet, Beshte.

20:17.453 --> 20:19.420
Little elephant.

20:25.461 --> 20:27.295
So much for stealth mode.

20:30.299 --> 20:32.300
They're getting closer!

20:32.351 --> 20:34.435
Hey, Mtoto!
Remember your trunk trick?

20:34.470 --> 20:36.270
Oh, yeah!

20:36.305 --> 20:38.189
Hey!

20:38.223 --> 20:42.276
- Take that, meanie!
- Poa! Nice shot!

20:42.311 --> 20:44.112
Oh, no!

20:44.563 --> 20:46.564
Aw, ya came back!

20:46.566 --> 20:49.400
And you brought your little friend!

20:49.402 --> 20:50.568
Wrong, Janja!

20:50.570 --> 20:54.238
He brought all his friends!
Ono, you're with me!

20:54.289 --> 20:56.124
Till the Pride Lands end,

20:56.158 --> 20:58.576
<i>Lion Guard defend!</i>

21:07.469 --> 21:10.421
Kion!
I sure am glad to see you!

21:10.472 --> 21:13.057
I'm just sorry we
couldn't find you sooner!

21:13.092 --> 21:14.425
Better late than
never, right, Big B?

21:14.476 --> 21:16.310
You said it, Little B.

21:18.397 --> 21:21.482
Swim, fur brains! Swim!

21:21.517 --> 21:24.068
You know, they'd
stand a better chance

21:24.103 --> 21:25.353
if they just got out of the river.

21:25.404 --> 21:27.271
Well, I'm not gonna tell 'em.

21:31.243 --> 21:33.444
So I just kept spraying
'em right in the face

21:33.495 --> 21:37.331
- while Beshte swam like the wind!
- Amazing!

21:37.366 --> 21:41.202
You kids had quite an adventure today.
And you know what?

21:41.253 --> 21:44.455
I think you've all earned
the Mark of the Guard.

21:47.459 --> 21:48.509
Wow!

21:48.544 --> 21:52.096
