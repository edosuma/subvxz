It's from
a diagnostic lab.

We should send his death

what this test was for.

final credit-card purchase

11:04.698 --> 11:07.632
before he fell off the grid
was last September 2nd --

11:07.634 --> 11:12.804
a charge of $9.73 at Vermont
grinds -- it's a coffee shop --

11:12.806 --> 11:16.541
uh, with an address one block
north of fountain on Vermont.

11:16.543 --> 11:19.277
Oh, right across the street
from where Tate's BMW was towed.

11:19.279 --> 11:20.679
Flynn:
Yeah, that's two doors down

11:20.681 --> 11:22.814
from the largest aa meeting
in Hollywood.

11:22.816 --> 11:27.118
So you think that our rapist
was getting sober, lieutenant?

11:27.120 --> 11:28.253
Could be, captain.

11:28.255 --> 11:31.723
Uh...So, um...

11:31.725 --> 11:33.591
$9.73, you say?

11:33.593 --> 11:35.994
Seems like a lot of money
for one cup of coffee.

Or he was at Vermont grinds
with someone, sir.

your curiosity, captain?

12:06.593 --> 12:07.826

of life did someone lead

Mark: He may have misjudged
many things in life,

12:28.081 --> 12:31.082

Tate is an alcoholic.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.685

to get 90 days.

but he went the long way 'round.

Mm. I've been on the other side
of an amends once or twice.

13:10.590 --> 13:13.158
In my experience,
saying "I'm sorry"

13:13.160 --> 13:15.527
doesn't always
get you off the hook.

13:15.529 --> 13:17.862
Did Tate put together
a list of people

13:17.864 --> 13:19.664

13:19.666 --> 13:22.267
There were 20, 25 names.
Sure.

specifically?

they weren't too open
to his apology.

Yeah. See, they -- they try

15:58.658 --> 16:00.158
He claimed to have been sober
for a month,

Mm-hmm.

39:39.745 --> 39:42.712
A-and it's not cheap.

39:42.714 --> 39:46.349
And I didn't pick it out.

39:46.351 --> 39:51.755
And I like it better than
anything I have ever had here.

39:51.757 --> 39:53.189
Really?

39:53.191 --> 39:54.657
Oh, yeah.

39:54.659 --> 39:56.626
Yeah, I do.

39:56.628 --> 39:58.395
It just...

39:58.397 --> 40:00.563
It looks great.

40:00.565 --> 40:01.765
Yes!

40:01.767 --> 40:03.433
Ah.

40:03.435 --> 40:07.303
But now my poor, old recliner
doesn't fit, does it?

40:07.305 --> 40:12.008
Yeah. Uh, I was wondering
about that, too.

40:12.010 --> 40:16.146
But since you got rid
of your duck lamps for me,

40:16.148 --> 40:19.015
I thought
I would give your chair

40:19.017 --> 40:21.217
a facelift.
Ah.

40:21.219 --> 40:23.753
I thought
a nice, soft leather might do.

40:23.755 --> 40:25.955
Leather?
Yeah. What do you think?

40:25.957 --> 40:27.290
My treat.

40:27.292 --> 40:28.858
Oh, your treat?
Mm-hmm.

40:28.860 --> 40:31.628
[ Chuckling ] Oh, well,
you know the way to my heart.

40:31.630 --> 40:32.896
Yes.
[ Laughs ]

40:32.898 --> 40:34.297
Patrice,
I, uh [Clears throat]

40:34.299 --> 40:37.400
There's something
that I need to tell you.

40:37.402 --> 40:38.435
Oh?

40:38.437 --> 40:41.137
About my duck lamps

40:41.139 --> 40:43.773
and my other stuff
that you tagged.

40:43.775 --> 40:45.241
It's okay, Louie.

40:45.243 --> 40:47.811
I know that you paid rusty
to put your things in storage.

40:47.813 --> 40:50.780
He told you?

40:50.782 --> 40:52.015
[ Laughing ] No.

40:52.017 --> 40:53.883
No, but his --
his cute, little friend

40:53.885 --> 40:55.819
said that he didn't think
everything would fit

40:55.821 --> 40:57.086
where they were taking it.

40:57.088 --> 40:59.022
And then rusty
just hopped all over him,

40:59.024 --> 41:01.191
saying he was certain
that goodwill had a warehouse.

41:01.193 --> 41:03.359
And it was
really kind of funny

41:03.361 --> 41:05.528
watching them
walk it all back.

41:05.530 --> 41:07.096
You don't mind?

41:07.098 --> 41:10.166
Mind?
[ Breathes deeply ]

41:10.168 --> 41:12.235
I put my things
in storage, too.

41:13.805 --> 41:15.605
I mean, what can I say?

41:15.607 --> 41:19.075
You just never know.
Right?

41:19.077 --> 41:23.213
So, you trust your partner,
and you cut the cards.

41:23.215 --> 41:25.782
That's just how I roll,
baby.

41:25.784 --> 41:27.484
[ Chuckles ]

41:27.486 --> 41:29.519
Mm.
Oh.

41:31.189 --> 41:33.723
Oh.

41:33.725 --> 41:35.658
