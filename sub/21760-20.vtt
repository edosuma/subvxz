Oh, Roger,
it's not exactly

01:26.290 --> 01:28.710
the most beautiful day
for a cruise on the river.

01:28.710 --> 01:31.170
Uh, a cruise?

01:31.170 --> 01:33.330
Ah, fresh sea air...

01:33.330 --> 01:35.460
Midnight buffet...

01:35.460 --> 01:38.420
A chance to see river pirates.

01:38.420 --> 01:40.330
It'll clear up
in no time.

01:41.880 --> 01:43.080
Hmm.

01:44.080 --> 01:46.040
Can't find your keys, right?

01:46.040 --> 01:49.580
I'll get us invited
on this cruise.

01:52.420 --> 01:55.210
Hey, it's my own
"Lucky" horseshoe.

01:55.210 --> 01:56.920
Hey, you know where
my keys are, boy?

01:58.080 --> 02:00.420
Okie dokie, partner.
Go get 'em!

02:02.290 --> 02:04.290
You know,
I'm beginning to think

02:04.290 --> 02:07.830
we're actually gonna get away
from old Halloween hair.

02:07.830 --> 02:09.120
Roger!

02:09.120 --> 02:10.620
Oh, sorry, honey.
I mean...

02:10.620 --> 02:12.210
Cruella.

02:12.210 --> 02:14.380
It doesn't seem possible.

02:14.380 --> 02:17.750
Oh hey, not even
Cruella can hurt us
if she's not around.

02:17.750 --> 02:20.170
Oh no! It's her!

02:20.170 --> 02:21.210
She's got me!

02:23.080 --> 02:24.250
I'm seeing spots
before my eyes!

02:24.250 --> 02:27.460
Uh, Roger, don't quit
your day job.

02:30.040 --> 02:31.250
What did I tell ya, honey?

02:31.250 --> 02:32.960
Lucky never fails me.

02:32.960 --> 02:34.250
Do ya, boy?

02:35.710 --> 02:37.830
Well, I just hope
it doesn't rain.

02:39.330 --> 02:42.000
Hey, they didn't invite us.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.170
Hey, they didn't not invite us.

03:05.120 --> 03:06.250
Whoa...

03:10.380 --> 03:11.750
Oh, what do you know,

03:11.750 --> 03:14.170
looks like we got
some stowaways.

03:14.170 --> 03:15.500
Aww!

03:15.500 --> 03:17.830
I guess they wanted
to get away from it all, too.

03:24.040 --> 03:26.710
It wouldn't dare.

03:26.710 --> 03:29.330
Nothing had better
upset our day away

03:29.330 --> 03:33.420
from those hideous Dearlys
and their disgusting dogs.

03:34.540 --> 03:36.170
Right, schnookums?

03:37.880 --> 03:38.920
Aah!

03:38.920 --> 03:41.330
Now where's the rest
of my luggage?

03:41.330 --> 03:43.460
Huh? Ow!

03:43.460 --> 03:45.960
That boat isn't going
to wait all day.

03:48.120 --> 03:51.920
Horace is bringing
the last batch now, Ms. de Vil.

03:58.750 --> 04:01.290
If-- if you don't mind
me saying so, ma'am,

04:01.290 --> 04:04.750
this seems like
a lot of luggage
for a three-hour tour.

04:06.580 --> 04:09.540
I do mind
your saying so.

04:12.210 --> 04:15.170
Besides, who knows
what a girl may need

04:15.170 --> 04:17.580
to convince a man
he's fallen in love with her?

04:17.580 --> 04:20.120
Eh, schnookums?

04:20.120 --> 04:22.120
Even on a three-hour tour.

04:24.710 --> 04:26.170
Now let's get going.

04:26.170 --> 04:28.040
The sun will be out any moment.

04:28.040 --> 04:30.000
I can feel it
in my bones.

04:44.210 --> 04:45.920
Oh, papa.

04:47.040 --> 04:49.040
We're gonna sail
in this weather?

04:49.040 --> 04:52.040
Of course not.
It's way too dangerous.

04:52.040 --> 04:53.750
And I have new pants.

04:53.750 --> 04:57.210
Bad weather, danger, pants--

04:57.210 --> 05:00.670
nothing stops
the great white whale.

05:00.670 --> 05:02.960
A great white whale?

05:02.960 --> 05:05.620
Don't pay any attention to him.

05:05.620 --> 05:07.290
It's a family thing.

05:07.290 --> 05:08.920
Roger...

05:08.920 --> 05:10.380
I don't like this.

05:10.380 --> 05:11.960
Oh, relax, honey.

05:11.960 --> 05:14.000
We're, you know,
having an adventure.

05:18.040 --> 05:21.000
Ugh. Dog hair.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.330
What?

05:22.330 --> 05:25.290
Avast, thar she blows.

05:29.830 --> 05:32.750
Ooh! Hello, sailor.

05:32.750 --> 05:34.210
What do you say
you and I find

05:34.210 --> 05:37.710
a little island
to get stranded on

05:37.710 --> 05:41.000
Okay, boys.
Just leave my essentials
with half-pint here.

05:42.040 --> 05:43.210
Aah!

05:45.710 --> 05:49.420
And I'll be back
after this three-hour tour.

05:54.250 --> 05:55.250
Oh!

06:05.920 --> 06:07.540
The big river.

06:07.540 --> 06:11.170
-Metaphor for
the soul's pilgrimage.

06:11.170 --> 06:13.420
Yoo-hoo, Captain!
Can I steer?

06:13.420 --> 06:14.880
Huh
Can I

06:25.750 --> 06:27.580
-Cruella: What a lovely display.

06:27.580 --> 06:31.330
Let's just see
what other hot dishes
are available on this tub.

06:31.330 --> 06:33.290
Besides you, of course.

06:38.710 --> 06:40.670
Oh look, you fed my Scorch.

06:40.670 --> 06:41.830
And you even thought
of dessert.

06:48.830 --> 06:51.620
I go for a man
that takes care of ferrets.

06:51.620 --> 06:54.120
This is going to be
a perfect cruise.

06:54.120 --> 06:58.750
Uh, excuse me, but I have to
go swab the... poop deck.

06:58.750 --> 07:00.790
And which deck is that?

07:00.790 --> 07:04.960
With all the dogs on board,
it could be any of 'em.

07:04.960 --> 07:06.500
Dogs?

07:06.500 --> 07:08.330
What dogs?

07:10.920 --> 07:12.120
Oh! Aah!

07:19.170 --> 07:22.460
Boring.
Not a river pirate in sight.

07:22.460 --> 07:23.830
Huh?

07:26.460 --> 07:28.330
Ferret!

07:30.120 --> 07:31.830
Scorch?

07:32.960 --> 07:35.250
I don't know which
is making me queasier,

07:35.250 --> 07:38.750
the storm
or that woman.

07:38.750 --> 07:40.670
Ugh.

07:44.420 --> 07:45.920
Hey! Uh, sit!

07:45.920 --> 07:46.960
Heel!

07:46.960 --> 07:48.380
Come on, Cap.

07:48.380 --> 07:51.460
Let go of your
neurotic need for control.

07:51.460 --> 07:53.880
Give me the wheel.

07:53.880 --> 07:55.830
Avast timber lay,
you mongrel!

07:55.830 --> 07:59.080
-Whee!

07:59.080 --> 08:00.710
Whee!

08:16.830 --> 08:19.540
Hey, let go of my pants!

08:19.540 --> 08:20.790
Aah!

08:20.790 --> 08:23.170
Nooooo!

08:23.170 --> 08:25.500
Oh dear, what'll I do,
what'll I do?

08:25.500 --> 08:29.330
What would a dog do,
dog do, dog do, dog do, dog do?

08:30.750 --> 08:34.580
Here goes nothing!

08:34.580 --> 08:37.500
Hey, watch your pushin',
weasel face!

08:56.830 --> 08:57.880
Lucky...

09:22.920 --> 09:25.040
Whew. We made it.

09:25.040 --> 09:27.710
No thanks
to your dead weight.

09:39.620 --> 09:40.710
Great.

09:40.710 --> 09:43.000
I wasn't planning on
calling this rock home,

09:43.000 --> 09:44.620
especially with you.

09:44.620 --> 09:46.210
This is all your fault!

09:46.210 --> 09:48.790
Now I'm stuck here
with a ferret.

09:59.540 --> 10:03.000
I'd better come up with a plan
before it starts raining again.

10:04.170 --> 10:05.920
-Oh!

10:05.920 --> 10:06.960
Huh?

10:10.380 --> 10:12.250
Oh, just great.

10:12.250 --> 10:14.380
Well, I'm not stickin' around.

10:14.380 --> 10:18.170
I'm building me a raft
and getting off this
stinkin' puny island.

10:23.960 --> 10:27.120
Gotta find somethin'
I can use to build a raft.

10:28.330 --> 10:29.330
Bingo!

10:29.330 --> 10:32.170
Oh man, those will be perfect!

10:38.460 --> 10:41.250
Now all I need is somethin'
to tie them together.

10:44.830 --> 10:46.710
Hey, those vines will work.

10:46.710 --> 10:48.460
Toss 'em down, Scorch?

10:48.460 --> 10:50.000
Uh-uh.

10:51.670 --> 10:53.580
Come on! I need 'em!

10:53.580 --> 10:54.880
Uh-uh.

10:54.880 --> 10:57.540
Please?

10:58.670 --> 10:59.750
No.

10:59.750 --> 11:02.670
Give me that vine!

11:11.750 --> 11:14.960
Well, so much for
gettin' off this island.

11:24.710 --> 11:27.330
Lucky

11:27.330 --> 11:29.250
As in not on board anymore?

11:29.250 --> 11:31.210
I've got to jump in
and save them!

11:36.040 --> 11:39.120
Uh, maybe we should
tell our pets instead.

11:39.120 --> 11:43.580
Rolly, sometimes
being a coward is
the right choice.

11:43.580 --> 11:45.540
Thanks... I think.

11:48.580 --> 11:50.830
I could be stranded
here for days.

11:50.830 --> 11:52.500
Months. Years.

11:52.500 --> 11:54.120
Leap years!

11:54.120 --> 11:55.500
Ugh.

11:55.500 --> 11:58.120
Well, gotta
build me a shelter.

11:58.120 --> 12:00.920
Let's see,
what are my resources?

12:00.920 --> 12:02.250
Hmm.

12:02.250 --> 12:06.500
Sand, sand, and more sand!

12:07.790 --> 12:10.290
Oh well.
Here goes.

12:23.920 --> 12:25.460
Huh?

12:34.500 --> 12:36.460
Huh?

12:36.460 --> 12:38.170
Huh?

12:49.580 --> 12:52.960
Mmm! Yum, yum!

13:10.460 --> 13:12.170
Now look what you've done.

13:12.170 --> 13:15.080
I'd have a lot better chance
at surviving without you.

13:16.920 --> 13:19.420
Anita:
Lucky, Scorch overboard?

13:19.420 --> 13:21.580
As in not on board anymore?

13:21.580 --> 13:24.420
Wow, they totally
understood your barks!

13:24.420 --> 13:27.290
Gee, I thought that
only happened on TV.

13:27.290 --> 13:28.330
Cruella:
Scorch?

13:28.330 --> 13:29.420
Scorch?

13:29.420 --> 13:31.170
Overboard?

13:31.170 --> 13:32.710
Oh, it was so awful.

13:32.710 --> 13:36.170
He absolutely destroyed
my best pants.

13:36.170 --> 13:37.920
We've gotta jump in
and save them.

13:39.250 --> 13:41.580
Maybe we should tell
the captain instead.

13:41.580 --> 13:45.500
Cruella, sometimes being
a coward is the right choice.

13:45.500 --> 13:47.420
Thank you. I think.

14:03.500 --> 14:04.500
Huh?

14:16.120 --> 14:18.500
Huh?

14:23.500 --> 14:24.670
Shoot.

14:24.670 --> 14:26.040
Huh?

14:34.330 --> 14:36.120
Food!

14:36.120 --> 14:37.330
Whoa!

14:53.460 --> 14:54.620
Mine!

14:57.250 --> 14:58.500
Oh, no you don't!

15:06.710 --> 15:08.000
Oh, swell.

15:08.000 --> 15:10.670
If we weren't fighting,
we could have had lunch.

15:11.920 --> 15:16.290
Uh, Scorch, how are we gonna
get down out of this tree?

15:30.290 --> 15:32.460
I sure hope
you can dog paddle.

15:44.580 --> 15:46.040
Cruella:
Captain!

15:46.040 --> 15:48.830
Turn this boat
around immediately!

15:48.830 --> 15:50.330
You won't be able
to stop and dictate

15:50.330 --> 15:52.460
to me through
a locked door.

15:57.380 --> 15:59.000
-Aah!
-You!

15:59.000 --> 16:00.420
Cruella, wait!

16:05.420 --> 16:08.460
I'm sure the captain
is a reasonable man.

16:08.460 --> 16:12.710
Okay, Captain,
a puppy and a ferret
have fallen overboard.

16:12.710 --> 16:15.120
We need to turn back
and retrieve them.

16:15.120 --> 16:17.460
What do they have to do
with the call

16:17.460 --> 16:19.540
of the great white whale?

16:19.540 --> 16:21.080
Clear the decks!

16:21.080 --> 16:23.830
Man the harpoon guns, ya swabs!

16:23.830 --> 16:26.330
Very effective, Rashid.

16:26.330 --> 16:28.580
Now we do it my way.

16:28.580 --> 16:31.420
-No, business.

16:31.420 --> 16:36.790
Suppose, Captain, I buy you
your very own whale.

16:36.790 --> 16:40.290
My very own whale?

16:40.290 --> 16:43.170
-I'll paint it myself.

16:44.170 --> 16:45.330
Hmm...

16:45.330 --> 16:46.460
No deal!

16:46.460 --> 16:50.000
-I want my Scorch!

16:57.250 --> 17:00.170
I guess I'll have to
take charge.

17:00.170 --> 17:01.170
Roger?

17:04.290 --> 17:05.750
Come on.

17:05.750 --> 17:09.170
Can't we all just get along?

17:09.170 --> 17:10.380
Both:
Butt out!

17:13.040 --> 17:15.460
That's not what
I had in mind.

17:15.460 --> 17:19.330
Oh, Cadpig, what's gonna
happen to Lucky?

17:19.330 --> 17:21.790
Well, he's always been lucky.

17:21.790 --> 17:24.830
All we can do is hope
that hasn't changed.

17:34.170 --> 17:35.620
Give me a break.

17:35.620 --> 17:36.620
Hey look!

17:43.080 --> 17:45.250
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

17:45.250 --> 17:47.170
You got a better idea?

17:53.290 --> 17:55.290
Cruella:
Take that, you runt!

17:55.290 --> 17:56.380
Captain:
No fair! Pinching!

18:01.710 --> 18:03.120
Don't make me...

18:04.210 --> 18:05.290
Look out!

18:13.620 --> 18:15.000
It's jammed!

18:15.000 --> 18:17.080
Then nobody's driving the boat!

18:22.620 --> 18:25.210
Cruella:
Ooh, you make me so angry!

18:25.210 --> 18:27.080
Quick, follow me!

18:28.120 --> 18:32.790
-Just a smidge more!

18:32.790 --> 18:36.250
Why do I always
end up on the bottom?

18:38.330 --> 18:39.960
Got it!

18:43.790 --> 18:47.580
Time to steer
a course to destiny!

18:50.670 --> 18:53.080
First, back to
Lucky and Scorch!

18:59.080 --> 19:03.290
All: Whoooa!

19:08.960 --> 19:11.170
Here we come, Lucky!

19:13.420 --> 19:15.380
No, you lean left!

19:15.380 --> 19:17.290
Whoa!

19:17.290 --> 19:19.120
Whoa!

19:20.170 --> 19:21.960
Whoa!

19:21.960 --> 19:24.830
You know, instead of fighting,

19:24.830 --> 19:26.880
maybe if we just
hung on together,

19:26.880 --> 19:30.080
we wouldn't get pitched
all over the place.

19:33.420 --> 19:35.500
You lie across the life wreath,

19:35.500 --> 19:37.170
then I'll lie over you.

19:37.170 --> 19:39.330
This ought to stabilize us.

19:39.330 --> 19:41.000
Whoa!

19:42.540 --> 19:43.960
Aah!

19:45.120 --> 19:47.290
Hang on.
We'll make it.

19:56.540 --> 19:59.210
Great, now that
the storm is breaking,
we'll find them!

19:59.210 --> 20:01.290
Do you see 'em, Cadpig?

20:01.290 --> 20:03.620
No, I-- wait!

20:03.620 --> 20:06.170
Yes! There they are!

20:07.620 --> 20:09.080
Oh look!
There they are!

20:09.080 --> 20:12.500
They're safe!
Oh, they're safe!

20:12.500 --> 20:14.000
Scorchy!

20:14.000 --> 20:16.290
Oh, Scorchy!

20:16.290 --> 20:18.580
Are you all right, pookums?

20:18.580 --> 20:23.120
Hey, it's the great white whale
disguised as a life ring!

20:25.670 --> 20:27.710
He can't fool me.

20:31.880 --> 20:33.040
Hmm...

20:34.210 --> 20:38.080
Ah. Thar she blow!

20:38.080 --> 20:39.250
Where?

20:43.830 --> 20:48.040
Stop the boat,
you tiny, whale-crazed...

20:50.580 --> 20:53.080
Say, who's driving this thing?

20:54.250 --> 20:56.210
♪ Sailing, sailing ♪

20:56.210 --> 20:58.000
♪ Over the bounding main ♪

21:09.960 --> 21:12.120
Just a bit more.

21:13.080 --> 21:16.210
Well, at least I got
my life ring back.

21:16.210 --> 21:19.920
Oh, Scorch!
Oh, Scorchums!

21:19.920 --> 21:21.920
Mummy missed you!

21:23.040 --> 21:25.040
How many times
do I have to tell you?

21:25.040 --> 21:27.040
Stay away from those dogs!

21:29.040 --> 21:30.670
Hey, Lucky.

21:30.670 --> 21:32.920
Yeah, you're lucky
your luck didn't run out, huh?

21:32.920 --> 21:35.080
Oh, good boy.

21:41.080 --> 21:43.330
Am I glad
to see you guys!

21:56.920 --> 21:59.080
I couldn't have done it
without you.

21:59.080 --> 22:00.960
Put it there.

22:02.540 --> 22:05.080
Uh, you better get
that leak fixed

22:05.080 --> 22:07.040
or you might run out
of hot air.
