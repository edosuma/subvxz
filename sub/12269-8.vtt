WEBVTT

00:02.073 --> 00:03.134
(Emily) MY FATHER
 WAS AN INNOCENT MAN,

00:03.134 --> 00:04.775
DESTROYED BY POWERFUL PEOPLE.

00:04.775 --> 00:06.777
THE GRAYSONS ARE BEHIND THIS,
AND THEY'RE GONNA PAY.

00:06.777 --> 00:10.041
I'VE DEDICATED MY LIFE
 TO AVENGING HIS DEATH.

00:10.041 --> 00:11.512
EVENTUALLY, SOMEONE'S
GONNA FIND YOU OUT.

00:11.512 --> 00:15.086
AND I WON'T STOP UNTIL
 THEY'VE ALL PAID THE PRICE.

00:15.086 --> 00:17.718
WORD IS THAT CONRAD GRAYSON
IS WRITING HIS MEMOIRS.

00:17.718 --> 00:20.121
I WOULD LOVE
TO TALK MORE ABOUT IT.

00:20.121 --> 00:22.053
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
 CONRAD GRAYSON SENT ME.

00:22.053 --> 00:24.195
IF YOU WANT ANY FUTURE
WITH YOUR SON, YOU LEAVE NOW.

00:24.195 --> 00:26.597
YOU CAN'T DENY THAT
WE'VE MADE A GOOD TEAM.

00:26.597 --> 00:28.659
I'M DECLARING MY INDEPENDENCE.

00:28.659 --> 00:31.362
YOU CAN'T DO THIS ALONE.
 GET THE HELL OUT OF MY HOUSE.

00:31.362 --> 00:34.405
DANIEL WANTS HIS EX-GIRLFRIEND
TO MAKE OUR WEDDING CAKE.

00:34.405 --> 00:35.706
DO YOU SUSPECT
SOMETHING'S AMISS?

00:35.706 --> 00:37.238
I THINK THAT YOU MAY BE
THE ONE FOR DANIEL.

00:37.238 --> 00:40.141
PERHAPS WE COULD WORK TOGETHER
TOWARDS A COMMON GOAL.

00:40.141 --> 00:42.413
(Nolan) LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE ABOUT
TO REKINDLE THEIR PAST.

00:42.413 --> 00:45.176
THEN I HAVE TO MAKE SURE
THEY HAVE NO FUTURE.

00:46.177 --> 00:49.220
(Emily) SECRECY CAUSES
 EVEN THE SIMPLEST TRUTH

00:49.220 --> 00:52.483
TO SEEM WONDROUS, MYSTERIOUS.

00:52.483 --> 00:54.225
IT HAS THE POWER
 TO FUEL PASSION

00:54.225 --> 00:57.828
AND SEDUCE YOU INTO BECOMING
 SOMEONE YOU'RE NOT.

00:57.828 --> 00:59.590
WE SHOULD GET GOING SOON.

00:59.590 --> 01:01.762
YOU DID TELL YOUR PARENTS
I WAS COMING, RIGHT?

01:01.762 --> 01:03.094
(laughs)

01:03.094 --> 01:04.765
OR THAT I EXIST?

01:04.765 --> 01:06.237
I THOUGHT WE'D SURPRISE THEM.

01:06.237 --> 01:07.598
BUT WHAT IF YOUR MOTHER
HATES ME?

01:07.598 --> 01:09.370
SHE WON'T. (kisses)

01:09.370 --> 01:11.442
AND EVEN IF SHE DOES,
I'LL PROTECT YOU.

01:12.743 --> 01:16.177
BUT NO MATTER HOW WE TRY
 TO GUARD OUR SECRETS,

01:16.177 --> 01:18.149
TO KEEP THEM CLOSE...

01:18.149 --> 01:19.310
(giggles)

01:19.310 --> 01:21.652
THEY ALL COME OUT EVENTUALLY.

01:29.760 --> 01:32.223
(turns off shower)

01:39.300 --> 01:41.172
(sighs)

01:43.434 --> 01:45.276
I WAS HOPING TO GET IN THERE
WITH YOU.

01:45.276 --> 01:47.508
I CAN'T.
I'M--I'M RUNNING LATE.

01:47.508 --> 01:50.311
YOU'VE BEEN GOING IN EARLIER
AND EARLIER ALL WEEK.

01:50.311 --> 01:52.643
MAYBE WE COULD
GET LUNCH TODAY.

01:52.643 --> 01:55.716
FIND A SECLUDED SPOT
ON THE DOCK, HAVE A PICNIC...

01:55.716 --> 01:57.488
YEAH. I, UH...

01:57.488 --> 01:59.250
I CAN'T TODAY.
I GOT TOO MUCH TO DO.

01:59.250 --> 02:02.293
I PROMISE... I'LL MAKE IT
UP TO YOU TOMORROW.

02:02.293 --> 02:04.255
(chuckles) I WOULD HOPE SO.

02:04.255 --> 02:06.727
OUR BRIDAL SHOWER
IS TOMORROW.

02:06.727 --> 02:08.799
RIGHT.

02:08.799 --> 02:11.202
I STILL DON'T GET WHY MY MOTHER
INSISTED IT BE CO-ED.

02:11.202 --> 02:15.766
OH, EVERYONE KNOWS YOUR MOTHER
PREFERS THE COMPANY OF MEN.

02:15.766 --> 02:18.239
I'M JUST HAPPY YOU'LL BE THERE
TO PROTECT ME FROM HER.

02:19.139 --> 02:21.642
YEAH.

02:27.218 --> 02:29.280
THAT WILL BE PERFECT, ROHAN.

02:29.280 --> 02:32.152
I'M ON PINS AND NEEDLES.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.754
(chuckles)

02:33.754 --> 02:36.527
THAT MEANS I'M EXCITED
TO SEE YOU.

02:36.527 --> 02:38.158
YES, PERFECT.

02:38.158 --> 02:40.931
CALL ME WHEN YOU LAND.
BYE-BYE.

02:40.931 --> 02:42.933
WOULD YOU JUST, UH,
DRY-CLEAN THE SILKS, PLEASE?
 (cell phone beeps)

02:42.933 --> 02:44.565
YES, MA'AM.
 THANK YOU.

02:44.565 --> 02:48.168
WELL, I SEE YOU'RE STILL TAKING
ADVANTAGE OF OUR AMENITIES.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.770
WHO WAS ON THE PHONE?

02:49.770 --> 02:52.403
OH, JUST A LITTLE SURPRISE
I'M PLANNING FOR THE SHOWER.

02:52.403 --> 02:53.574
WELL, SINCE YOU'VE SUDDENLY

02:53.574 --> 02:55.175
GOTTEN INTO THE SPIRIT
OF THINGS,

02:55.175 --> 02:57.748
MAYBE YOU WANNA MAKE
THE WELCOME TOAST?

02:57.748 --> 02:58.909
I LOST MY PHONE.

02:58.909 --> 03:00.311
WHICH RELATES HOW?

03:00.311 --> 03:01.552
WELL, I HAD THE SPEECH FOR EMILY
SAVED ON THERE,

03:01.552 --> 03:03.254
AND I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO RECOMPOSE IT.

03:03.254 --> 03:04.415
MM.

03:04.415 --> 03:05.816
PROBABLY FOR THE BEST

03:05.816 --> 03:08.289
SINCE I DIDN'T INHERIT YOUR
TALENT FOR FAKING SINCERITY.

03:08.289 --> 03:09.890
IT'S CALLED BEING POLITE.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.292
AND PERHAPS WE WOULDN'T
HAVE TO BE

03:11.292 --> 03:13.394
IF SARA HAD RESPONDED
TO MY APPEAL.

03:13.394 --> 03:14.965
I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HER
ALL WEEK.
 (cup clatters)

03:14.965 --> 03:18.269
MAYBE BECAUSE SHE'S TOO BUSY
SNEAKING AROUND WITH DANIEL.

03:18.269 --> 03:20.801
I NOTICED HER TEXTING
WITH HIM THIS MORNING,

03:20.801 --> 03:23.804
SO WHATEVER CARROT YOU DANGLED,
IT SEEMS TO BE WORKING.

03:23.804 --> 03:24.975
(chuckles)

03:24.975 --> 03:26.777
(Jack) SHE WON'T STOP DIGGING.

03:26.777 --> 03:28.239
MARGAUX'S DETERMINED
TO WRITE THIS EXPOSé.

03:28.239 --> 03:29.980
SHE'S CONVINCED IT'LL HELP
 "VOULEZ'S" SALES.

03:29.980 --> 03:32.443
YEAH, BUT WHAT EXACTLY
DID SHE DISCOVER?

03:32.443 --> 03:34.245
NOTHING YET,
BUT SHE'S RESEARCHING ARTICLES

03:34.245 --> 03:37.418
ON GRAYSON GLOBAL, CONRAD,
THE ACQUISITION OF NolCorp, YOU.

03:37.418 --> 03:39.290
OH? (chuckles)

03:39.290 --> 03:42.222
DID SHE HAPPEN TO SEE
THAT I MADE, UH,

03:42.222 --> 03:44.255
"PEOPLE'S" SEXIEST MEN ALIVE
LIST,

03:44.255 --> 03:45.956
RIGHT BEHIND JOEL McHALE?

03:45.956 --> 03:51.362
SO WHAT IF MARGAUX MANAGES
TO SNIFF OUT SOME TRUTH?

03:51.362 --> 03:54.405
YOU KNOW, MAYBE IT'S TIME
THAT A LITTLE GETS OUT THERE.

03:54.405 --> 03:56.767
NOT WHEN
IT INVOLVES CONRAD.

03:56.767 --> 03:58.939
ALL I'M ASKING IS THAT
IF SHE CONTACTS YOU,

03:58.939 --> 04:00.311
DON'T GIVE HER ANY LEADS.

04:00.311 --> 04:01.972
ALL RIGHT.

04:03.314 --> 04:05.245
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

04:05.245 --> 04:07.378
ROOMMATE-PROOFING.

04:07.378 --> 04:09.249
AIDEN MATHIS IS MOVING IN.
 (tapping pen)

04:09.249 --> 04:10.421
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

04:10.421 --> 04:11.822
HE'S A DECENT GUY.

04:11.822 --> 04:13.284
WHO CAUSED ME
TO SEND MY SON AWAY.

04:14.785 --> 04:18.329
WELL, MAYBE THAT'S NOT
A BAD THING.

04:18.329 --> 04:20.430
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT CARL'S SAFETY

04:20.430 --> 04:23.664
TILL THE WEDDING'S OVER,
AND WHEN IT IS, THEY'LL LEAVE,

04:23.664 --> 04:26.667
AND YOU WON'T EVER
HAVE TO SEE AIDEN AGAIN.

04:27.938 --> 04:30.841
HE'S...
HE'S LEAVING WITH EMILY?

04:32.903 --> 04:35.546
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
THEY WERE TOGETHER.

04:35.546 --> 04:36.847
(thud)

04:36.847 --> 04:38.579
EMS.

04:38.579 --> 04:41.382
DIDN'T HEAR YOU SNEAK IN.

04:41.382 --> 04:42.983
JUST BROUGHT A FEW THINGS
FOR AIDEN.

04:42.983 --> 04:44.485
THANKS AGAIN
FOR HELPING US OUT.

04:46.717 --> 04:49.820
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THAT
THAT WAS YOUR PLAN?

04:49.820 --> 04:51.291
YOU KNEW I WAS LEAVING.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.464
WITH THE GUY WHO TRIED TO
STRONG-ARM ME OUT OF TOWN?

04:53.464 --> 04:55.065
YOU CONVENIENTLY LEFT
THAT PART OUT.

04:55.065 --> 04:56.767
YOU GAVE ME A DEADLINE
TO END THIS.

04:56.767 --> 04:58.899
YOU DON'T GET TO PASS JUDGMENT
ABOUT WHAT I DO WHEN IT'S DONE.

04:58.899 --> 05:02.032
YOU'RE RIGHT.

05:02.032 --> 05:03.374
I DON'T.

05:15.816 --> 05:18.789
HEY. LEAVING SO SOON?

05:18.789 --> 05:22.393
I HAVE A FEW MORE THINGS
TO CHECK OFF MY LIST.

05:22.393 --> 05:25.396
(indistinct conversations)

05:37.107 --> 05:38.609
OH.
 (laughs)

05:38.609 --> 05:40.040
SAW IT FIRST.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.613
NOW BECAUSE I'M A GENTLEMAN,
I'LL HAND IT OVER.

05:42.613 --> 05:45.846
A GENTLEMAN OR A STALKER?

05:45.846 --> 05:47.077
YOUR TEXT SAID
YOU'D BE HERE,

05:47.077 --> 05:49.580
BUYING INGREDIENTS
FOR MY WEDDING CAKE.

05:49.580 --> 05:50.621
THAT WASN'T AN INVITE?

05:50.621 --> 05:52.853
NO?
 (chuckles)

05:52.853 --> 05:55.526
ALL RIGHT, I'LL GO.
 (laughing) NO.
DON'T, DON'T. DON'T.

05:55.526 --> 05:57.057
I KNOW EMILY WANTED LEMON,

05:57.057 --> 05:59.990
BUT, UH, I WAS JUST TOYING
WITH A STRAWBERRY LAYER.

05:59.990 --> 06:02.993
BUT YOU KNOW YOUR FIANCéE
BETTER THAN I DO.

06:02.993 --> 06:04.995
YOU THINK
SHE'LL PUT UP A FIGHT?

06:04.995 --> 06:06.997
SARA...
 (chuckles)

06:06.997 --> 06:09.500
WHAT AM I DOING?

06:09.500 --> 06:11.071
(sighs) I'M SORRY.

06:11.071 --> 06:12.102
I JUST, UH...

06:12.102 --> 06:15.005
THIS ISN'T LIKE ME, DANNY.

06:15.005 --> 06:16.947
MY FATHER DITCHED MY MOM
FOR ANOTHER WOMAN.

06:16.947 --> 06:19.610
I DO NOT WANT TO DO THAT
TO EMILY.

06:19.610 --> 06:21.011
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE
TO GET YOU OUT OF MY HEAD

06:21.011 --> 06:22.583
SINCE THE 4th OF JULY.

06:22.583 --> 06:25.015
YEAH, WELL... YOU NEED TO.

06:25.015 --> 06:26.417
WE BOTH DO.
 DO WE?

06:26.417 --> 06:28.459
I MEAN THAT, HONESTLY.

06:28.459 --> 06:30.721
IF WE COULD JUST
TALK ABOUT ALL THIS--
 TALK ABOUT IT?
YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED--

06:30.721 --> 06:32.793
YOU'RE GETTING MARRIED
IN TWO WEEKS, DANNY.
 I KNOW--

06:32.793 --> 06:33.924
YOU SHOULD BE TALKING TO
YOUR FIANCéE.
 YOU'RE RIGHT.

06:33.924 --> 06:35.596
I KNOW. I KNOW.

06:36.767 --> 06:38.999
I JUST CAN'T...

06:38.999 --> 06:41.702
HELP BUT WONDER WHY YOU'VE COME
INTO MY LIFE WHEN YOU DID.

06:44.905 --> 06:47.608
WELL, UH...

06:47.608 --> 06:49.079
IT WAS GOOD TO SEE YOU.

06:49.079 --> 06:50.911
(bill rustling)

06:50.911 --> 06:52.443
KEEP THE CHANGE.
 THANK YOU.

06:54.144 --> 06:55.786
(sets down strawberries)

06:57.488 --> 07:00.621
DANNY! WAIT.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.853
I'LL BE HERE SUNDAY...

07:02.853 --> 07:04.054
IN CASE YOU'RE FREE.

07:04.054 --> 07:06.927
OKAY.

07:06.927 --> 07:09.129
(starts engine)

07:09.129 --> 07:10.631
SEE YOU.

07:20.871 --> 07:32.553
HELLO, SARA.

07:36.627 --> 07:38.228
(voice breaking) I SHOULD'VE...

07:38.228 --> 07:41.231
GOTTEN THE HINT WHEN DANNY
BLEW ME OFF THIS MORNING.

07:42.633 --> 07:44.665
(inhales deeply) I CAME TO
SURPRISE HIM FOR LUNCH.

07:44.665 --> 07:46.767
WHEN I SAW HIM PULLING OUT
OF HIS PARKING LOT,

07:46.767 --> 07:48.138
I FOLLOWED HIM HERE.

07:50.470 --> 07:51.942
HOW LONG
HAS IT BEEN GOING ON?

07:51.942 --> 07:53.604
THIS ISN'T WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE,
EMILY.

07:53.604 --> 07:54.845
REALLY? SO IT'S JUST
A COINCIDENCE THAT YOU...

07:54.845 --> 07:56.577
(inhales deeply)
RAN INTO EACH OTHER HERE,

07:56.577 --> 07:58.048
JUST LIKE AT THE BAKERY AND--
 NO, EMILY,

07:58.048 --> 08:00.751
YOU HAVE MISUNDERSTOOD
THIS WHOLE SITUATION.
 HAVE I REALLY?

08:05.215 --> 08:07.888
(crying)

08:09.760 --> 08:11.822
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S WRONG
WITH ME.

08:11.822 --> 08:15.666
I GUESS IT'S JUST THE STRESS
OF THE WEDDING.

08:15.666 --> 08:16.997
AND GOD, VICTORIA--

08:16.997 --> 08:20.601
SHE CONSTANTLY T-TREATS ME LIKE
I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

08:20.601 --> 08:21.802
OH, SHE DOES THAT TO EVERYONE.
 NOT YOU.

08:21.802 --> 08:23.974
I'M SURE YOU'RE THE KIND
OF GIRL A MOTHER LOVES.

08:23.974 --> 08:25.505
(sighs)

08:25.505 --> 08:27.778
THAT'S WHY I FEEL
SO THREATENED BY YOU.

08:27.778 --> 08:28.939
(sniffles)

08:32.182 --> 08:33.614
(sighs)

08:33.614 --> 08:34.745
THANKS.

08:34.745 --> 08:38.518
I AM NOT PERFECT. OKAY?

08:38.518 --> 08:41.792
BUT YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.
I AM NOT A HOME WRECKER.

08:43.293 --> 08:45.596
(inhales deeply) GOD, I'M SORRY
FOR BREAKING DOWN ON YOU.

08:45.596 --> 08:47.658
IT'S OKAY.
 (exhales deeply)

08:47.658 --> 08:49.159
DO ME A FAVOR--
DON'T TELL DANIEL.

08:49.159 --> 08:51.632
I'M EMBARRASSED ENOUGH
AS IT IS.

08:51.632 --> 08:53.163
YOU SHOULDN'T BE.

08:53.163 --> 08:55.105
THANK YOU.

09:04.144 --> 09:06.647
WE WANT THAT TO BE HERE.

09:06.647 --> 09:07.818
MM-HMM.
YEAH, THAT SHOULD WORK.

09:07.818 --> 09:09.079
MR. GRAYSON.

09:09.079 --> 09:10.621
I WASN'T EXPECTING YOU.

09:10.621 --> 09:13.053
I DIDN'T THINK I'D GET
TO READ PAGES SO SOON.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.925
SADLY, YOU DON'T.

09:14.925 --> 09:17.728
IN FACT, YOU'LL HAVE TO WAIT
UNTIL THE BOOK HITS THE SHELVES.

09:17.728 --> 09:19.760
SINCE
OUR PRELIMINARY DISCUSSION,

09:19.760 --> 09:21.732
I WAS OFFERED
A MORE LUCRATIVE DEAL

09:21.732 --> 09:23.634
FROM ANOTHER PUBLISHING COMPANY.

09:23.634 --> 09:26.196
YOU USED MY GENEROSITY
TO START A BIDDING WAR.

09:26.196 --> 09:28.068
OH, NO. NO, NO. I JUST...

09:28.068 --> 09:30.140
CREATED MY OWN MARKETPLACE.

09:30.140 --> 09:33.143
IT'S A LESSON EVERY
YOUNG ENTREPRENEUR SHOULD LEARN,

09:33.143 --> 09:36.747
AS REFERENCED IN MY PROLOGUE.

09:36.747 --> 09:38.308
DON'T FORGET TO PREORDER.

09:42.713 --> 09:44.014
OOH.

09:44.014 --> 09:47.317
HOW YOU MUST MISS THE GRANDEUR
OF YOUR LAST OFFICE.

09:47.317 --> 09:49.089
OH, WHAT WE LACK IN SPACE,

09:49.089 --> 09:51.992
WE ALSO LACK
IN ILLEGAL ACTIVITY.

09:51.992 --> 09:53.263
(chuckles)

09:53.263 --> 09:54.925
YOU'RE NOT STILL GOING FORWARD
WITH MARGAUX?

09:54.925 --> 09:57.227
I TOLD YOU, SHE'S BEEN
INVESTIGATING LAST YEAR'S EVENTS

09:57.227 --> 09:58.729
AND WHAT HAPPENED IN '93.

09:58.729 --> 10:00.270
I TOOK YOUR ADVICE
AND I MOVED ON.

10:00.270 --> 10:01.802
THESE ARE FOR YOU.

10:01.802 --> 10:04.604

 SINCE YOU'VE ALWAYS
FANCIED YOURSELF A WRITER,

10:04.604 --> 10:06.637

HELP ME BRAINSTORM A TITLE.

10:06.637 --> 10:08.739
SURE, BUT NOT TODAY.
I CAN'T. I'M SWAMPED.

10:08.739 --> 10:10.180
OH.

10:10.180 --> 10:13.814
AND YET, YOU STILL FOUND TIME
TO SHOP FOR ORGANIC BERRIES.

A FRIEND.

TO MAKE YOUR WEDDING CAKE.

I THOUGHT THAT AN ODD CHOICE.

10:36.106 --> 10:38.769

GET HER BACK ON HER FEET, OKAY?

14:12.522 --> 14:14.454

I'M HEARING OF IT?

15:02.902 --> 15:05.335
YOU HAVEN'T YET EARNED YOUR SPOT
IN THE CLUB.

15:05.335 --> 15:08.108

THIS FROM MOM

15:13.483 --> 15:14.644
WHEN WE WERE IN THE RED?

15:14.644 --> 15:16.916
BECAUSE THE DEED IS
SOLELY IN MY NAME,

15:16.916 --> 15:19.449
GIVEN TO ME BY MY FATHER,
WHOSE FATHER GAVE IT TO HIM.

15:19.449 --> 15:23.093
NO MRS. GRAYSON HAS EVER
KNOWN ABOUT IT.

15:23.093 --> 15:24.394
YOU SEE, CONTRARY
TO WHAT THEY SAY,

15:24.394 --> 15:28.358
THE SECRET TO STAYING
HAPPILY MARRIED IS SECRECY.

15:28.358 --> 15:31.061
I'M NOT KEEPING THINGS
FROM EMILY, DAD.

15:31.061 --> 15:32.132
SO I GUESS SHE KNOWS ABOUT

15:32.132 --> 15:34.164
YOUR LITTLE TRIP
TO THE FARMERS' MARKET.

15:34.164 --> 15:38.268
LOOK, DANIEL, EVEN TITANS NEED
A SAFE HARBOR FROM THE STORMS--

15:38.268 --> 15:40.610
PROFESSIONAL OR PERSONAL.

15:40.610 --> 15:43.443
AND YOU CAN
TRUST ANDERSON HERE

15:43.443 --> 15:47.477
TO KEEP THE NATURE OF YOUR
ESCAPADES CLOSE TO HIS VEST.

15:49.419 --> 15:51.021
I DON'T WANT
TO CHEAT ON MY WIFE.

15:51.021 --> 15:53.053

DANIEL.

15:53.053 --> 15:55.986
LOOK, I'M GONNA PUT THIS TO YOU
AS MY FATHER PUT IT TO ME

15:55.986 --> 15:59.059
WHEN HE FIRST BROUGHT ME HERE--
DO NOT MARRY YOUR MISTRESS.

15:59.059 --> 16:01.331
EMILY IS YOUR PERFECT MATCH.

16:01.331 --> 16:03.663
SO IF YOU GET BORED, YOU KNOW,
SWITCH PARAMOURS, NOT WIVES.

16:03.663 --> 16:06.166
FOR ONE THING,
IT'S FAR MORE COST-EFFECTIVE.

16:06.166 --> 16:09.139

ARE CHEAP.

I MET THIS GUY.

19:28.368 --> 19:30.200
A PHOTOGRAPHER.

19:30.200 --> 19:32.872
THINGS HAPPENED,
AND HE TOOK SOME...

19:32.872 --> 19:35.675
ARTISTIC SHOTS OF ME.

19:35.675 --> 19:36.846
NUDE.

19:36.846 --> 19:38.878
I WAS IN AN AWFUL HEADSPACE.

19:38.878 --> 19:41.381
SOME CREEP STOLE MY PHONE,
FOUND THE PHOTOS,

19:41.381 --> 19:43.182
AND NOW HE'S BLACKMAILING ME.

19:43.182 --> 19:44.884
YOU DO KNOW I DON'T WORK
FOR YOUR PARENTS ANYMORE, RIGHT?

19:44.884 --> 19:47.717
GOOD. THIS CAN'T GET BACK
TO THEM.

19:47.717 --> 19:50.220
OR ANYONE ELSE,
FOR THAT MATTER.

19:50.220 --> 19:51.861
OKAY. WELL, HOW DID HE
CONTACT YOU?

19:51.861 --> 19:54.624
BY E-MAIL.

19:54.624 --> 19:56.326
HE WANTS 40 GRAND.

19:56.326 --> 19:59.229
CAN YOU MAKE IT GO AWAY?

19:59.229 --> 20:01.331
(sighs)

20:01.331 --> 20:02.832
LOOK, I'M--I'M ALREADY LATE
TO MY BROTHER'S SHOWER, SO--

20:02.832 --> 20:05.505
NO. UM, GIVE ME YOUR...
COMPUTER.

20:05.505 --> 20:09.309
I'LL, UM... ESTABLISH CONTACT.
I'LL TAKE IT FROM THERE.

20:09.309 --> 20:10.840
(exhales)

20:10.840 --> 20:12.211
HOW MUCH IS IT GONNA
COST ME?

20:12.211 --> 20:13.383
NO, DON'T SWEAT IT.

20:13.383 --> 20:14.984
FIRST ONE'S FREE.

20:17.317 --> 20:18.488
(mouths words)

20:18.488 --> 20:19.989
MM-HMM.

20:24.994 --> 20:26.756
(exhales)

20:28.698 --> 20:30.360
(woman) CAN'T WAIT TO SEE IT.
 (man) YEAH.

20:30.360 --> 20:32.962
I'M SURPRISED YOU GOT
MY MOTHER A HOSTESS PRESENT.

20:32.962 --> 20:34.264
YOU PLAYING NICE?

20:34.264 --> 20:35.465
NOT FOR HER.

20:35.465 --> 20:37.236
(piano playing light jazz)

20:37.236 --> 20:39.809
I THOUGHT... (chuckles)
I THOUGHT WE SAID NO GIFTS.

20:39.809 --> 20:42.772
WELL, NOW I FEEL LIKE A JACKASS.
I-I LEFT YOURS AT HOME.

20:42.772 --> 20:45.715
OH, YOU CAN GIVE IT
TO ME LATER.

20:45.715 --> 20:48.648
(guests murmuring)

20:48.648 --> 20:50.750
OH, WELCOME, DARLINGS.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.422
I HOPE THAT EVERYTHING
PLEASES YOU.

20:52.422 --> 20:55.254
NO EXPENSE WAS SPARED TO MEET
ALL OF YOUR EXPECTATIONS, EMILY,

20:55.254 --> 20:57.327
AND ALL OF YOUR DESIRES,
DANIEL.

20:57.327 --> 20:58.788
IN FACT,

20:58.788 --> 21:01.691
I HIRED MS. MUNELLO
TO HANDLE TODAY'S FESTIVITIES.

21:03.333 --> 21:04.834
AFTER ALL,

21:04.834 --> 21:08.938
IT ISN'T THE WORST IDEA TO GET
A TASTE OF WHAT'S TO COME.

21:15.875 --> 21:16.976
IT TOOK SOME TIME FOR MY BROTHER

21:16.976 --> 21:18.047
TO FIND SOMEONE
WHO'D PUT UP WITH HIM.

21:18.047 --> 21:20.650
AND I GET THAT.
HE CAN BE ANNOYING.

21:20.650 --> 21:22.752
(laughter)

21:22.752 --> 21:24.614
BUT HE'S STILL MY BEST FRIEND.

21:25.815 --> 21:27.817
SO, EMILY, BE GOOD TO HIM,

21:27.817 --> 21:29.659
OR YOU'LL HAVE ME TO DEAL WITH.

21:29.659 --> 21:31.521
(laughter)

21:31.521 --> 21:33.062
TO DANIEL AND EMILY.

21:33.062 --> 21:34.724
(all) TO DANIEL AND EMILY.

21:34.724 --> 21:35.995
(man) CHEERS.

21:35.995 --> 21:37.697
(laughter,
indistinct conversations)

21:37.697 --> 21:39.599
I SEE YOU DRANK TO THAT.
 (Daniel) MM.

21:39.599 --> 21:40.770
REFILLS?

21:40.770 --> 21:42.031
I'LL GET US ALL ONE.

21:42.031 --> 21:44.834
THAT WAS LOVELY, CHARLOTTE.
THANK YOU.

21:44.834 --> 21:46.976
I MEANT EVERY WORD.

21:46.976 --> 21:50.810
MS. GRAYSON?
SOMEONE PHONED FOR YOU.

21:57.717 --> 21:59.419
EXCUSE ME.

22:02.021 --> 22:05.024
(indistinct conversations)

22:08.458 --> 22:10.029
WELL,
 NOW WHO'S THE STALKER?

22:10.029 --> 22:12.632
(sighs) WELL, AT LEAST
I HAVE A LEGITIMATE EXCUSE.

22:12.632 --> 22:14.604
DO YOU?
WHEN I SAW YOU YESTERDAY,

22:14.604 --> 22:16.035
YOU DIDN'T MENTION
YOU'D BE WORKING THE PARTY.

22:16.035 --> 22:18.438
WELL, UH, IT WAS
A LAST-MINUTE OFFER,

22:18.438 --> 22:20.740
AND, WELL, I COULDN'T AFFORD
TO SAY NO.

22:20.740 --> 22:22.412
MM.

22:22.412 --> 22:23.743
WELL, JUST SO LONG AS YOU'RE
WORKING FOR MY MOTHER

22:23.743 --> 22:24.944
AND NOT WITH HER.
 (chuckles)

22:24.944 --> 22:26.646
WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT?

22:26.646 --> 22:29.449
BECAUSE SHE SEEMS
ABNORMALLY GIDDY TODAY,

22:29.449 --> 22:32.051
AND THAT USUALLY MEANS
SHE'S UP TO SOMETHING.

22:32.051 --> 22:34.053
(whispers) I SHOULD GET BACK
TO WORK.

22:34.053 --> 22:36.586
IT'S NOT LIKE WE CAN'T TALK
TO EACH OTHER, SARA.

22:36.586 --> 22:37.687
WE'RE NOT DOING
ANYTHING WRONG.

22:37.687 --> 22:39.589
IT'S THE FACT
THAT WE WANT TO.

22:39.589 --> 22:40.860
HELLO AGAIN, SARA.

22:40.860 --> 22:42.792
EM, CAN YOU BELIEVE
THESE LITTLE THINGS?

22:42.792 --> 22:44.894
THEY'RE LIKE CAKES FOR ELVES.
 (chuckles)

22:44.894 --> 22:46.736
WOW. SARA REALLY CAN DO IT ALL,
CAN'T SHE?

22:46.736 --> 22:49.939
THANKS TO YOU, I KNOW
OUR WEDDING'S GONNA BE PERFECT.

22:49.939 --> 22:51.941
(Victoria)
GATHER AROUND, EVERYONE.

22:51.941 --> 22:53.943
WE'RE GOING TO PLAY
A LITTLE GAME.

22:53.943 --> 22:56.646
CONRAD, DANIEL, COME HERE.

22:56.646 --> 22:58.848
SINCE WHEN DOES MY MOTHER
PLAY GAMES?

23:01.681 --> 23:05.785
(indistinct conversations)

23:05.785 --> 23:07.617
I KNOW YOU WERE EXPECTING
SOMEBODY FAR PRETTIER,

23:07.617 --> 23:09.519
BUT CHARLOTTE SENDS HER REGRETS.

23:09.519 --> 23:11.761
(clears throat) I TAKE IT
YOU BROUGHT THE PHONE?

23:11.761 --> 23:13.593
LOOK, MAN,
MY DEAL'S WITH THE GIRL.

23:13.593 --> 23:15.895
WELL, I'M HER REPRESENTATIVE.
YOU CAN GIVE IT TO ME.

23:15.895 --> 23:17.727
NOT UNTIL I SEE THE MONEY,
I'M NOT.

23:17.727 --> 23:19.128
OKAY, $40,000, RIGHT?

23:19.128 --> 23:20.530
UH-HUH.

23:20.530 --> 23:22.802
YOU SEE, I'M NOT SURE THAT
THAT'S VERY FAIR.

23:22.802 --> 23:26.606
OH? WELL, SEE, UH, TMZ,
THEY'RE--

23:26.606 --> 23:28.107
THEY'RE WILLING TO PAY
ALMOST AS MUCH.

23:28.107 --> 23:31.581
YOU KNOW, THEY PAY TOP DOLLAR
FOR CELEB NUDIE PHOTOGRAPHS.

23:31.581 --> 23:33.643
YEAH, BUT WHAT'S THE PRICE
FOR A GIRL'S INNOCENCE?

23:33.643 --> 23:35.515
(chuckles) THAT SLUT
IS ANYTHING BUT INNOCENT.

23:35.515 --> 23:37.817
YOU KNOW THAT'S SOMEONE'S
LITTLE GIRL.

23:37.817 --> 23:38.988
THAT'S SOMEONE'S SISTER.

23:38.988 --> 23:41.851
(laughs) WHATEVER
YOUR THING IS, I DON'T--

23:41.851 --> 23:44.724
(grunting)

23:44.724 --> 23:46.425
AAH! AAH!

23:46.425 --> 23:48.598
HEY, HEY, HEY! BREAK IT UP!
BREAK IT UP!
 (man) TAKE IT EASY!

23:48.598 --> 23:51.631
REMEMBER WHAT I SAID ABOUT
COMPLICATIONS, JACK?

23:51.631 --> 23:52.802
DON'T BE ONE.

23:52.802 --> 23:56.435
JACK, LEAVE HIM ALONE.

23:56.435 --> 23:58.468
(crowd murmuring)

23:58.468 --> 23:59.639
(sniffs)

23:59.639 --> 24:00.770
UHH!

24:04.744 --> 24:06.175
(man panting)

24:06.175 --> 24:09.178
(crowd continues murmuring)

24:11.120 --> 24:12.482
WHILE I'M NOT THE TYPE

24:12.482 --> 24:14.954
TO PARTAKE
IN WEDDING SHOWER GAMES,

24:14.954 --> 24:16.856
MY WIFE INSISTED.

24:16.856 --> 24:20.630
AND AS MY SON WILL SOON LEARN,
YOUR WIFE NOT ONLY DICTATES

24:20.630 --> 24:23.132
THE GAMES YOU PLAY
 AND THE RULES,

24:23.132 --> 24:25.935
BUT SOMEHOW SHE ALWAYS WINS.

24:25.935 --> 24:27.637
(laughter)

24:27.637 --> 24:30.570
AND TODAY,
SHE HAS CONJURED UP

24:30.570 --> 24:33.072
HER OWN MODEST VERSION
OF "THIS IS YOUR LIFE."

24:33.072 --> 24:34.904
AND WE INVITE YOU

24:34.904 --> 24:39.078
TO TAKE A TRIP WITH DANIEL
DOWN MEMORY LANE.

24:39.078 --> 24:41.911
(woman) UH-OH.
 (laughter)

24:41.911 --> 24:44.614
NOW AS MANY OF YOU KNOW,
I'M WRITING MY MEMOIRS--

24:44.614 --> 24:46.556
AH, HOW'S THAT FOR
A SHAMELESS PLUG?

24:46.556 --> 24:48.487
(laughter)
 AND IN DOING SO,

24:48.487 --> 24:51.090
I'VE BEEN RECALLING
DANNY'S MANY NICKNAMES.

24:51.090 --> 24:54.263
HE WAS "GRAYSTROKE"
AT HARVARD,

24:54.263 --> 24:56.726
"BOONE" AT SUMMER CAMP,

24:56.726 --> 24:59.799
AND IN HIGH SCHOOL,
HIS LACROSSE TEAM DUBBED HIM...

24:59.799 --> 25:03.102
"ANKLE BREAKER," 'CAUSE HE BROKE
MINE DURING J.V. PLAYOFFS.

25:03.102 --> 25:04.704
(laughter)
 JAMES DENNIS.

25:04.704 --> 25:07.176
(woman) AHH!
 (applause)

25:07.176 --> 25:08.708
HOW YOU DOING?

25:08.708 --> 25:10.940
(laughs) GOOD TO SEE YOU.

25:10.940 --> 25:12.141
WELL DONE.

25:12.141 --> 25:15.284
CONRAD SCREWED ME OVER.

25:15.284 --> 25:17.787
A FEELING YOU MUST BE
ALL TOO FAMILIAR WITH.

25:17.787 --> 25:19.919
SEEMS ALL
YOUR HARDSHIPS BEGAN

25:19.919 --> 25:22.752
AFTER GRAYSON GLOBAL'S
ACQUISITION OF NolCorp.

25:22.752 --> 25:27.296
MY PROBLEMS STARTED
LONG BEFORE THAT, KITTEN.

25:27.296 --> 25:31.731
AND AS MUCH AS I WOULD LOVE
TO SCAPEGOAT CONRAD FOR THEM,

25:31.731 --> 25:33.733
IT'S NOT MY STYLE.

25:33.733 --> 25:38.938
BUT TAKE IT FROM SOMEONE
WHO WAS ON THE INSIDE--

25:38.938 --> 25:40.970
THERE'S NOTHING
ABOUT GRAYSON GLOBAL

25:40.970 --> 25:44.073
THAT'S WORTH WRITING
IN A BATHROOM STALL,

25:44.073 --> 25:45.745
LET ALONE IN A BOOK.

25:45.745 --> 25:48.247
END OF STORY.

25:48.247 --> 25:49.819
(Conrad) SHE WAS
YOUR NINTH GRADE LATIN TEACHER.

25:49.819 --> 25:50.880
TOO BAD.

25:50.880 --> 25:54.223
IT SEEMS IT'S TIME
I MOVED ON.

25:54.223 --> 25:57.086
SMART GIRL.
 (applause)

25:57.086 --> 25:58.888
(woman) I AM JUST SO HAPPY
TO BE HERE.

25:58.888 --> 26:00.960
(Daniel) GOOD TO SEE YOU.
THANKS SO MUCH FOR COMING.
 I'M SO PROUD.

26:00.960 --> 26:02.031
TAKE CARE.

26:02.031 --> 26:04.063
EMILY, COME JOIN ME,
WILL YOU?

26:04.063 --> 26:05.564
MM.

26:05.564 --> 26:10.239
(indistinct conversations)

26:10.239 --> 26:13.102
AH. WELL,
IT BREAKS MY HEART

26:13.102 --> 26:15.705
THAT EMILY HAS SO FEW FRIENDS
AND FAMILY,

26:15.705 --> 26:18.778
ESPECIALLY SINCE
MOMENTS LIKE THESE

26:18.778 --> 26:20.710
SHOULD BE SHARED
BY LOVED ONES.
 HMM.

26:20.710 --> 26:24.614
FINDING SOMEONE TO PARTICIPATE
TODAY WAS NO EASY FEAT,

26:24.614 --> 26:29.689
BUT... I DID STUMBLE UPON
A VERY OLD ACQUAINTANCE.

26:29.689 --> 26:32.061
HE'S VERY HANDSOME,

26:32.061 --> 26:34.293
A BIT OF A SILVER FOX,

26:34.293 --> 26:35.925
AND EXTREMELY WEALTHY.

26:35.925 --> 26:38.097
SURELY YOU HAVEN'T
FORGOTTEN THAT.

26:38.097 --> 26:40.830
HMM? AFTER ALL...

26:40.830 --> 26:43.833
HE WAS YOUR HUSBAND.
 (murmuring)

26:43.833 --> 26:45.635
WHAT?

26:45.635 --> 26:48.107
KYA HAAL CHAAL HAI, EMILY?

26:48.107 --> 26:50.980
ROHAN.

26:50.980 --> 26:52.812
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

26:52.812 --> 26:54.343
(lowered voice)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, VICTORIA?

26:54.343 --> 26:56.816
(Hindi accent)
NEVER DO YOU WRITE OR CALL.

26:56.816 --> 26:58.117
I SEE NOW WHY.

26:58.117 --> 27:01.290
HOW BUSY YOU MUST BE
WITH THIS YOUNG ONE.

27:01.290 --> 27:03.793
HOW I MISSED YOU SO.

27:03.793 --> 27:05.124
(kisses)
 (chuckles)

27:05.124 --> 27:06.956
THIS IS A JOKE, RIGHT?

27:06.956 --> 27:08.798
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.

27:08.798 --> 27:10.299
IT WAS A MARRIAGE
OF CONVENIENCE.

27:10.299 --> 27:12.732
OH. I HADN'T REALIZED THAT.

27:12.732 --> 27:15.164
IT WASN'T MY MOST HONEST MOMENT,
BUT... (inhales deeply)

27:15.164 --> 27:17.306
I DID IT TO HELP ROHAN.
 OH? WITH WHAT?

27:17.306 --> 27:18.868
TRUE LOVE.

27:18.868 --> 27:20.670
I WAS BEING IN DANGER
OF DEPORTATION,

27:20.670 --> 27:22.942
AND I HAD JUST FALLEN
FOR SOMEONE.

27:22.942 --> 27:25.775
I HELPED ROHAN OBTAIN
HIS GREEN CARD

27:25.775 --> 27:28.377
SO THAT HE COULD STAY WITH HIS
PARTNER BENNY. HI! (chuckles)

27:28.377 --> 27:29.819
(mouths word)

27:29.819 --> 27:31.150
(chuckles) YOU TOLD ME
ON THE PHONE

27:31.150 --> 27:32.651
THAT THE MARRIAGE WAS A DISASTER
AND LEFT YOU PENNILESS.

27:32.651 --> 27:33.823
YOU SAID THAT?

27:33.823 --> 27:35.685
WELL, MY ENGLISH
SOMETIMES UP AND DOWN.

27:35.685 --> 27:37.857
IT WAS RO WHO ALMOST
BLED ME DRY

27:37.857 --> 27:39.658
IN THE BRIEF TIME
THAT WE WERE TOGETHER.

27:39.658 --> 27:41.090
HE'S NEVER BEEN GOOD
WITH MONEY.

27:41.090 --> 27:42.862
HE STILL ISN'T.

27:42.862 --> 27:44.033
(laughter)
 BUT ENOUGH OF ME.

27:44.033 --> 27:46.435
TO EMILY, WHO HELPED ME
FIND LOVE.

27:46.435 --> 27:49.168
HOW HAPPY I AM
THAT SHE HAS FOUND HERS.
 OH.

27:49.168 --> 27:52.702
I AM ON THE PINS AND NEEDLES
FOR YOU AND DANIEL.

27:52.702 --> 27:54.744
IT MEANS "EXCITED," YES?

27:57.046 --> 27:58.748
(guests) HEAR, HEAR.

27:58.748 --> 28:00.379
VICTORIA,
WHAT A THOUGHTFUL GIFT.

28:00.379 --> 28:02.051
I MUST FIND A WAY TO REPAY YOU.

28:02.051 --> 28:05.014
(indistinct conversations)

28:05.014 --> 28:07.286
(sighs) DANIEL,
I SHOULD'VE TOLD YOU.

28:07.286 --> 28:09.719
JUST BY THE TIME WE WERE
ENGAGED, I...

28:09.719 --> 28:10.790
I FELT AWKWARD
BRINGING IT UP.

28:10.790 --> 28:12.091
I SHOULD'VE KNOWN THAT

28:12.091 --> 28:14.193
YOUR MOTHER WOULD TRY
TO USE IT AGAINST ME.

28:14.193 --> 28:15.795
WELL, YEAH,
THAT'S WHAT SHE DOES.
 MM.

28:15.795 --> 28:17.767
YOU TOOK IT IN STRIDE,
THOUGH.

28:17.767 --> 28:19.929
WELL, I GUESS
I'M GETTING USED TO IT.

28:19.929 --> 28:22.431
MM.
 (breathes deeply)

28:22.431 --> 28:23.472
I'D LOVE FOR YOU TO
MEET ROHAN.

28:23.472 --> 28:26.475
YES.

28:35.184 --> 28:37.486
SO NOW YOU'VE SEEN HER ABILITY
TO SPIN THE TRUTH.

28:37.486 --> 28:39.088
HERS OR YOURS?

28:39.088 --> 28:41.250
(scoffs) I SHOULD NEVER
HAVE COME HERE.

28:41.250 --> 28:43.722
I WAS NAIVE... OR HOPEFUL.

28:43.722 --> 28:46.395
YEAH, MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT THAT
EMILY AND DANNY WON'T WORK OUT,

28:46.395 --> 28:48.027
BUT IT WON'T BE HER FAULT.

28:48.027 --> 28:50.499
YOU CANNOT BE FOOLED
BY THAT GIRL.

28:50.499 --> 28:52.461
YOU THINK YOU'RE PROTECTING
YOUR SON...

28:52.461 --> 28:56.806
(scoffs) BUT YOUR PSYCHO
OBSESSION'S ONLY HURTING HIM.

28:56.806 --> 28:58.838
LET HIM GO.

28:58.838 --> 29:00.870
I'M GONNA DO THE SAME.

29:02.772 --> 29:04.373
GOOD-BYE, VICTORIA.

29:18.287 --> 29:21.260
(speaking Japanese)

29:25.264 --> 29:27.496
(speaks Japanese)

29:27.496 --> 29:30.339
SO... RO,

29:30.339 --> 29:32.872
YOU WERE SCHOOLED
IN REVENGE, TOO?

29:32.872 --> 29:37.176
WHEN I FIRST WENT TO JAPAN,
ROHAN WAS TRAINING WITH TAKEDA.

29:37.176 --> 29:39.849
HE'S SINCE COMPLETED
HIS MISSION.

29:39.849 --> 29:42.051
OH. WELL, HOW DID YOURS END?

29:42.051 --> 29:46.215
IS THE PERSON WHO WRONGED YOU
IN JAIL?

29:46.215 --> 29:47.516
DEAD?

29:47.516 --> 29:49.088
WORSE?

29:49.088 --> 29:51.220
(American accent) WE'RE TAUGHT
ONCE OUR GOAL'S COMPLETE

29:51.220 --> 29:52.421
NOT TO MENTION IT AGAIN.

29:52.421 --> 29:55.064
DON'T BRAG AFTER A SHAG.

29:55.064 --> 29:56.465
GOT IT.

29:56.465 --> 29:58.828
THOUGH THE WHOLE
GREEN CARD THING,

29:58.828 --> 30:01.100
I ASSUME THAT WAS PART
OF TODAY'S ACT.

30:01.100 --> 30:02.972
NO, NO.

30:02.972 --> 30:05.004
EMILY ACTUALLY DID THAT
FOR ME.

30:05.004 --> 30:07.937
THANKS TO HER, I FOUND
HAPPINESS AFTER REVENGE.

30:07.937 --> 30:10.039
I HOPE SHE'LL FIND THE SAME.

30:10.039 --> 30:12.111
SO YOU WERE MARRIED,

30:12.111 --> 30:13.843
BUT YOU WEREN'T A GOLD DIGGER?

30:13.843 --> 30:16.485
NO, NO. ROHAN MADE HIS FORTUNE
LONG BEFORE WE MET.

30:16.485 --> 30:19.148
NOT BY DIGGING GOLD,
BUT MINING RUBIES.

30:19.148 --> 30:21.190
OOH, I ALMOST FORGOT...

30:25.394 --> 30:28.057
YOU BOUGHT THE SEAFARER. RAD.

30:28.057 --> 30:29.228
I WAS HOPING
YOU COULD SET IT

30:29.228 --> 30:31.500
IN SOMETHING MORE SUITABLE
FOR A BRIDE.

30:31.500 --> 30:33.262
A RUBY, PERHAPS?

30:33.262 --> 30:35.334
RED IS HER FAVORITE COLOR.

30:35.334 --> 30:38.037
IT'LL BE MY WEDDING PRESENT
TO YOU.

30:38.037 --> 30:40.109
(whispers) BENNY'S WAITING.

30:40.109 --> 30:42.341
THANK YOU. BYE.

30:44.413 --> 30:46.175
WHEN YOU CONFESSED
TO BIZZY PRESTON

30:46.175 --> 30:47.977
ABOUT YOUR MARRIAGE,

30:47.977 --> 30:50.079
YOU KNEW THAT VICTORIA
WOULD TAKE THE BAIT

30:50.079 --> 30:52.581
AND SPEND THE NEXT TWO WEEKS
CHASING HER TAIL.

30:52.581 --> 30:54.123
AND ANYONE
WHO WAS THERE TODAY

30:54.123 --> 30:56.555
CAN TESTIFY TO HOW DESPERATE
VICTORIA WAS

30:56.555 --> 30:58.427
TO DESTROY MY ENGAGEMENT.

30:58.427 --> 31:01.530
THE EVIDENCE DOES
KEEP PILING UP.

31:01.530 --> 31:04.934
THIS IS GONNA BE
ONE HELL OF A WEDDING.

31:06.996 --> 31:08.167
(doorbell rings)

31:08.167 --> 31:09.538
(closes box)

31:09.538 --> 31:11.200
(sets down box)

31:15.474 --> 31:17.506
I WASN'T SURE
YOU GOT MY TEXT.

31:17.506 --> 31:21.210
(fire crackling)

31:21.210 --> 31:22.912
DANNY. UM...

31:24.353 --> 31:27.186
I ONLY CAME TO SAY THAT I WON'T
BE MAKING YOUR WEDDING CAKE.

31:27.186 --> 31:30.459
AND... GOOD-BYE.

31:30.459 --> 31:32.191
WHAT?

31:32.191 --> 31:33.362
IS THIS--IS THIS BECAUSE

31:33.362 --> 31:35.224
I ACCUSED YOU OF WORKING
WITH MY MOTHER?

31:35.224 --> 31:36.665
IF--IF SO, I'M SORRY.

31:36.665 --> 31:39.668
NO, NO. PLEASE DON'T BE.
YOU WEREN'T WRONG.

31:39.668 --> 31:41.100
OKAY, FOR THE PAST TWO WEEKS,

31:41.100 --> 31:42.131
SHE'S BEEN TRYING
TO SNAKE CHARM ME

31:42.131 --> 31:43.432
INTO COMING BETWEEN
YOU AND EMILY,

31:43.432 --> 31:45.304
AND--AND I COULDN'T DO THAT.

31:45.304 --> 31:46.605
ESPECIALLY AFTER
WHAT I SAW TODAY.

31:46.605 --> 31:48.037
OH, WELL, AFTER WHAT I SAW,

31:48.037 --> 31:49.638
I DON'T THINK I CAN GO THROUGH
WITH THIS WEDDING.

31:49.638 --> 31:52.211
AND IT TOOK UNTIL TODAY
TO REALIZE

31:52.211 --> 31:54.013
THAT EMILY AND MY MOTHER
ARE THE SAME PERSON,

31:54.013 --> 31:55.985
AND I DO NOT WANNA MARRY
MY MOTHER.

31:59.248 --> 32:01.450
CAN I SHOW YOU SOMETHING?

32:11.430 --> 32:14.663
REMEMBER THIS?

32:14.663 --> 32:18.007
I GAVE IT TO YOU
THAT SUMMER.

32:20.239 --> 32:23.272
I NEVER TOLD YOU, BUT...

32:23.272 --> 32:26.115
AFTER THE ACCIDENT,
I THOUGHT I'D LOST YOU.

32:26.115 --> 32:29.518
I SPENT THAT NIGHT PACING
THE HOSPITAL HALLS.

32:31.250 --> 32:34.283
BY THE TIME THE DOCTORS CAME BY
TO TELL ME THAT YOU WERE STABLE,

32:34.283 --> 32:37.486
THE DIAMOND HAD CUT INTO MY PALM
FROM CLENCHING IT SO TIGHTLY.

32:37.486 --> 32:40.129
I MEAN, I DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE
THE E.M.T.s HAD GIVEN IT TO ME.

32:42.131 --> 32:44.093
YOU HELD ONTO IT
ALL THIS TIME.

32:44.093 --> 32:45.594
I NEVER...

32:45.594 --> 32:48.037
THOUGHT YOU'D ALLOW ME
THE CHANCE TO RETURN IT.

32:48.037 --> 32:51.140
WE CAN'T UNDO OUR PAST,
DANNY.

32:51.140 --> 32:53.102
I KNOW.

32:53.102 --> 32:54.573
I JUST DON'T WANNA
FORGET IT, EITHER.

32:58.177 --> 32:59.348
CAN I?

33:05.254 --> 33:08.217
I'M NOT ASKING YOU
TO COMMIT TO ANYTHING.

33:08.217 --> 33:10.489
I JUST CAN'T COMMIT
TO EMILY,

33:10.489 --> 33:13.262
NOT WHEN I FEEL THIS WAY
ABOUT YOU.

33:13.262 --> 33:14.423
(exhales)

33:14.423 --> 33:15.564
(whispers) I WON'T RISK
LOSING YOU AGAIN.

33:25.334 --> 33:27.236
MM. NO. NO, NO, NO.

33:27.236 --> 33:29.508
NO, WE CAN'T DO THIS.

33:29.508 --> 33:32.111
OKAY? NOT UNTIL
YOU'VE SPOKEN TO HER.

33:32.111 --> 33:33.582
WE WON'T. WE WON'T.

33:35.214 --> 33:36.615
(whispers) I JUST DON'T WANNA
SAY GOOD NIGHT.

33:46.195 --> 33:48.557
SOMEONE HAD THE DAFT IDEA

33:48.557 --> 33:50.399
OF SENDING THESE HERE
AFTER THE SHOWER.

33:50.399 --> 33:52.201
AND I THOUGHT THAT YOU MIGHT
WANT TO TAKE THESE HOME

33:52.201 --> 33:54.763
SO YOU COULD GET AN EARLY START
ON YOUR THANK-YOUS.

33:54.763 --> 33:56.165
IT SEEMS YOU COULD'VE
HAD YOUR STAFF

33:56.165 --> 33:57.336
BRING THEM DOWN TO MY HOUSE.

33:57.336 --> 33:58.737
OH, YES,

33:58.737 --> 34:01.410
BUT THERE'S ONE GIFT I WOULDN'T
TRUST ANYONE TO DELIVER.

34:01.410 --> 34:04.173
BUT YOU'VE ALREADY GIVEN ME
THE GREATEST GIFT, VICTORIA.

34:04.173 --> 34:06.715
IT WAS LOVELY
TO SEE ROHAN AGAIN.

34:06.715 --> 34:08.617
HMM. EMILY...

34:08.617 --> 34:09.648
HAD I KNOWN
THAT YOU WERE KEEPING

34:09.648 --> 34:11.480
SUCH A SECRET FROM DANIEL--

34:11.480 --> 34:13.652
THAT IS WHAT YOU WERE
BANKING ON, ISN'T IT?

34:13.652 --> 34:19.228
YES. YOU'VE ALWAYS KNOWN THAT I
DOUBTED YOUR DEVOTION TO MY SON.

34:19.228 --> 34:22.591
AND I'VE NEVER QUESTIONED HIS
UNTIL NOW.

34:22.591 --> 34:25.793
WHAT'S THIS?

34:25.793 --> 34:27.766
YOU SEE, FOR YEARS,

34:27.766 --> 34:30.099
THE GRAYSON MEN HAVE
HAD A LITTLE PIED-à-TERRE

34:30.099 --> 34:31.469
NEAR THE MET.

34:31.469 --> 34:34.273
AND THEY'VE PASSED IT DOWN
FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION,

34:34.273 --> 34:37.505
ONE AFTER ANOTHER
HAVE STRUTTED AROUND,

34:37.505 --> 34:40.349
THINKING THEIR WIVES WERE
CLUELESS ABOUT THEIR LIAISONS.

34:40.349 --> 34:42.581
BUT WE'VE ALWAYS KNOWN
IF WE WISHED TO.

34:42.581 --> 34:44.213
AND WE'VE PASSED
THAT LITTLE CARD

34:44.213 --> 34:46.585
TO EACH
NEW FUTURE MRS. GRAYSON

34:46.585 --> 34:48.317
AS A SORT OF WEDDING GIFT.

34:48.317 --> 34:50.219
WELL, I APPRECIATE THE GESTURE,
VICTORIA,

34:50.219 --> 34:53.222
BUT DANIEL AND I ARE
NOTHING LIKE YOU AND CONRAD.

34:53.222 --> 34:54.862
WE'RE MORE ALIKE
THAN YOU THINK.

35:04.273 --> 35:05.434
GO ON.

35:05.434 --> 35:07.736
SEE FOR YOURSELF.

35:10.739 --> 35:12.311
(beep, dial tone)

35:12.311 --> 35:14.783
(dialing)

35:14.783 --> 35:17.216
(line rings)

35:17.216 --> 35:18.247
(line connects)

35:18.247 --> 35:20.189
HELLO AGAIN, MRS. GRAYSON.

35:20.189 --> 35:21.790
IT SEEMS YOUR SON
AND HIS LADY FRIEND

35:21.790 --> 35:23.292
HAVE SETTLED IN FOR THE NIGHT.

35:23.292 --> 35:25.224
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

35:25.224 --> 35:27.696
(intercom buzzes)
 (Daniel) Anderson, can we get
some more ice, please?

35:27.696 --> 35:30.429
(click)
 RIGHT AWAY, MR. GRAYSON.

35:30.429 --> 35:32.461
NO.

35:32.461 --> 35:34.303
THAT'LL BE ALL.

35:35.804 --> 35:37.606
(beep)

35:47.446 --> 35:49.918
(waves crashing)

35:49.918 --> 35:52.451
(knock on door)

35:54.853 --> 35:56.355
(sets down box)

36:01.660 --> 36:03.362
(wind chimes tinkling)

36:03.362 --> 36:04.533
HEY.

36:04.533 --> 36:06.395
YOU ALONE?

36:06.395 --> 36:08.437
YEAH. DANIEL'S IN THE CITY.

36:08.437 --> 36:11.300
GOOD, 'CAUSE I WANNA TALK
TO YOU. IT'S ABOUT YOUR SISTER.

36:11.300 --> 36:12.501
OKAY.

36:14.703 --> 36:16.605
SOME GUY STOLE HER PHONE.

36:16.605 --> 36:18.907
HE WAS APPARENTLY
BLACKMAILING HER WITH IT.

36:18.907 --> 36:21.410
IS SHE OKAY?
 SHE'S FINE,

36:21.410 --> 36:25.183
BECAUSE YOUR BOYFRIEND BEAT
THE HELL OUT OF HIM IN MY BAR.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.715
AIDEN DID?
 BRUTALLY.

36:26.715 --> 36:29.458
AND I CAN SEE FROM YOUR REACTION
THAT HE HASN'T TOLD YOU.

36:29.458 --> 36:30.959
NOW YOU TOLD ME
IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS

36:30.959 --> 36:32.491
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THIS IS
ALL OVER.

36:32.491 --> 36:33.962
BUT HOW WELL
DO YOU KNOW AIDEN?

36:33.962 --> 36:35.894
I THOUGHT THIS WAS ABOUT
MY SISTER.

36:35.894 --> 36:37.226
WHERE DID YOU MEET HIM?

36:37.226 --> 36:39.568
WE TRAINED TOGETHER.

36:39.568 --> 36:41.530
WE'RE A LOT ALIKE.
HE LOST HIS FAMILY, TOO.

36:41.530 --> 36:43.372
SO I HEARD.

36:43.372 --> 36:44.703
WHAT DO YOU WANT, JACK?

36:44.703 --> 36:46.275
I WANNA KNOW THAT
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

36:46.275 --> 36:47.436
OF COURSE I DO.

36:47.436 --> 36:48.507
WOULD YOU EVEN TELL ME
IF YOU DIDN'T?

36:51.640 --> 36:54.683
YOU WERE ALWAYS SECRETIVE.

36:54.683 --> 36:56.214
(sighs)

36:56.214 --> 36:59.488
EVEN WHEN WE WERE KIDS,
AND YOU'D SEE A SHOOTING STAR,

36:59.488 --> 37:03.252
YOU'D NEVER TELL ME
WHAT YOU WISHED FOR.

37:03.252 --> 37:05.724
I REALIZE NOW IT'S NOT
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T THINK

37:05.724 --> 37:08.657
IT WAS GONNA COME TRUE.
IT'S BECAUSE...

37:08.657 --> 37:09.798
YOU'RE AFRAID.

37:09.798 --> 37:11.229
OF WHAT?

37:11.229 --> 37:12.431
OF LETTING PEOPLE IN.

37:12.431 --> 37:15.764
YOU KNOW, MAYBE I WAS
A LOT SMARTER THEN,

37:15.764 --> 37:17.606
BECAUSE HAD I NOT TOLD YOU
THE TRUTH, WHO I REALLY AM,

37:17.606 --> 37:19.608
MAYBE YOU WOULDN'T HATE ME
RIGHT NOW.

37:19.608 --> 37:22.010
I COULD NEVER HATE YOU.

37:23.512 --> 37:25.414
AND NOT FOR LACK OF TRYING.

37:25.414 --> 37:28.477
IT'S JUST, AFTER SEEING
AIDEN TODAY, I... (sighs)

37:28.477 --> 37:30.419
I THINK YOU DESERVE MORE
THAN YOU'RE GETTING.

37:30.419 --> 37:31.880
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW HIM.

37:31.880 --> 37:33.352
(sighs)

37:33.352 --> 37:36.485
AND TO BE HONEST,
YOU DON'T KNOW ME.

37:36.485 --> 37:37.926
NOT ANYMORE.

37:37.926 --> 37:39.358
YOU'RE RIGHT.

37:47.496 --> 37:49.468
YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT
I USED TO WISH FOR?

37:51.500 --> 37:53.502
THAT NOTHING
WOULD EVER CHANGE.

38:00.609 --> 38:04.313
(footsteps depart)

38:10.819 --> 38:14.493
YOU DIDN'T CALL FIRST.
WHAT IF I HAD HAD COMPANY?

38:14.493 --> 38:16.765
WELL, LOOKS LIKE YOU ALREADY
GOT RID OF THEM.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.373
OR YOU DIDN'T.

38:24.373 --> 38:26.335
SHOULD I BE CONCERNED?

38:26.335 --> 38:27.836
TURNS OUT I DIDN'T NEED
TO BE INSIDE GRAYSON MANOR

38:27.836 --> 38:29.378
TO PLAY MY PART.

38:29.378 --> 38:32.481
I BORROWED CHARLOTTE'S LAPTOP,
GOT HER I.P. ADDRESS,

38:32.481 --> 38:34.443
Wi-Fi CODE,
MUMMY'S CREDIT CARD DETAILS.

38:34.443 --> 38:36.785
NOW YOU TELL ME. BUT...
THAT'S EVERYTHING WE NEED

38:36.785 --> 38:39.348
TO SET UP VICTORIA AS THE BUYER
OF THE MURDER WEAPON.

38:39.348 --> 38:43.492
I, UH, ASSUME EMILY KNOWS
YOU TOOK ADVANTAGE

38:43.492 --> 38:44.623
OF HER BABY SIS?

38:44.623 --> 38:46.495
I MERELY TOOK ADVANTAGE
OF AN OPPORTUNITY

38:46.495 --> 38:47.796
WHILST HELPING CHARLOTTE.

38:47.796 --> 38:49.327
THERE WAS NO NEED TO PESTER
EMILY WITH THE DETAILS.

38:49.327 --> 38:50.429
LOOK, THIS ISN'T GONNA BE
A THING, IS IT?

38:50.429 --> 38:51.730
YOU GIVING ME GUILT ABOUT

38:51.730 --> 38:53.462
HOW I NEED TO OPENLY COMMUNICATE
WITH MY GIRLFRIEND?

38:53.462 --> 38:55.734
NO. I JUST--
 GOOD,

38:55.734 --> 38:57.436
BECAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED YOU TO DO,

38:57.436 --> 38:58.807
AND IT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT.

38:58.807 --> 39:01.740
THIS STAYS BETWEEN
YOU AND ME.

39:05.414 --> 39:06.615
(Victoria)
"THE CHOICES WE MAKE"?

39:06.615 --> 39:08.517
MM-HMM.

39:08.517 --> 39:11.420
DANIEL, UH, CHOSE IT.

39:11.420 --> 39:13.852
(scribbling)
 SIMPLE BUT PROFOUND,

39:13.852 --> 39:17.386
CONSIDERING THE LESSON I'VE BEEN
TRYING TO PASS DOWN TO HIM.

39:17.386 --> 39:18.887
AND WHAT IS THAT EXACTLY?

39:18.887 --> 39:21.029
DISCRETION...

39:21.029 --> 39:24.533
IS ESSENTIAL
IN ALL FACETS OF LIFE.

39:24.533 --> 39:25.894
YOU KNOW, I MAY HAVE
SINGLE-HANDEDLY SAVED

39:25.894 --> 39:27.836
DANIEL'S RELATIONSHIP
WITH EMILY.

39:27.836 --> 39:29.498
HMM.

39:29.498 --> 39:31.800
I THINK THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE
SOME REWRITES TO DO

39:31.800 --> 39:33.702
ONCE HE CALLS OFF
THIS WEDDING.

39:33.702 --> 39:36.505
(laughs)
ARE YOU STILL IN DENIAL

39:36.505 --> 39:39.648
ABOUT HOW YOUR TRANSPARENT
SHOWER STUNT BACKFIRED?

39:39.648 --> 39:43.412
OH, COME ON. I KNOW YOU WERE
ROOTING FOR THE OTHER WOMAN.

39:43.412 --> 39:46.985
NOT SURPRISING,
CONSIDERING YOU WERE ONE.

39:46.985 --> 39:49.718
MM. THANK GOD THOSE DAYS
ARE OVER.

39:49.718 --> 39:53.391
HMM. DO YOU REMEMBER THAT
TERRIBLY OBVIOUS BACHELOR PAD

39:53.391 --> 39:54.392
YOU TOOK ME TO?

39:54.392 --> 39:56.064
OH, I...

39:56.064 --> 39:58.527
I GOT RID OF THAT PLACE
YEARS AGO.

39:59.968 --> 40:02.070
I'M ALL YOURS NOW, DARLIN'.

40:02.070 --> 40:04.433
PITY.

40:08.607 --> 40:11.480
(inhales deeply)

40:11.480 --> 40:14.913
(exhales deeply)

40:16.044 --> 40:17.486
WE NEED TO TALK.

40:17.486 --> 40:18.647
ME FIRST.

40:28.126 --> 40:29.828
BUT YOU ALREADY GAVE ME
A WATCH.

40:29.828 --> 40:32.501
WELL, THIS WASN'T PLANNED.

40:34.032 --> 40:36.905
(sighs deeply)

40:36.905 --> 40:38.667
BUT BEFORE YOU OPEN IT,

40:38.667 --> 40:41.139
I HAVE SOMETHING TO CONFESS
TO YOU, DANIEL.

40:41.139 --> 40:45.443
I FOLLOWED YOU.

40:45.443 --> 40:48.617
I SAW YOU AND SARA AT
THE FARMERS' MARKET YESTERDAY.

40:48.617 --> 40:51.720
AFTER YOU LEFT,

40:51.720 --> 40:55.554
I CONFRONTED HER.

40:55.554 --> 40:57.756
AND I BROKE DOWN
ON THAT POOR GIRL.

40:57.756 --> 40:59.858
(breathes deeply)

40:59.858 --> 41:03.031
YOU KNOW I TRUST YOU.
I JUST...

41:03.031 --> 41:06.064
COULDN'T GET A HOLD
OF MY EMOTIONS.

41:06.064 --> 41:08.937
IT WAS SO UNLIKE ME THAT

41:08.937 --> 41:11.670
I REALIZED SOMETHING ELSE
MUST BE GOING ON.

41:11.670 --> 41:15.003
SO I WENT TO THE DOCTOR.

41:15.003 --> 41:17.646
ARE YOU OKAY?

41:17.646 --> 41:19.247
(whispers) I'M GREAT.

41:19.247 --> 41:23.552
(normal voice)
AS IT TURNS OUT...

41:23.552 --> 41:24.883
WE'RE PREGNANT.

41:27.155 --> 41:28.987
LOOK. (laughs)

41:38.767 --> 41:39.868
(chuckles)

41:39.868 --> 41:43.131
HEY. SORRY I MISSED YOU EARLIER.

41:43.131 --> 41:45.804
YOU WANT TO, UH, YOU WANNA
COME BY TONIGHT?

41:45.804 --> 41:49.207
I CAN'T. I HAVE A LAST MINUTE
MEETING IN THE CITY.

41:49.207 --> 41:52.240
THAT SOUNDS MYSTERIOUS.
 It is.

41:52.240 --> 41:55.243
SOMEONE CONTACTED ME, CLAIMING
TO KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT CONRAD

41:55.243 --> 41:57.546
TO FILL A BOOK OF THEIR OWN.

41:57.546 --> 42:00.919
PROBABLY SOME LUNATIC
LOOKING FOR CASH.

42:00.919 --> 42:03.752
AFTER MY DISAPPOINTING CHAT
WITH NOLAN ROSS TODAY,

42:03.752 --> 42:05.794
MY FERVOR FOR THE STORY
IS DYING.

42:05.794 --> 42:07.225
WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD.

42:07.225 --> 42:09.858
WELL, NOT IF IT MEANS MORE TIME
FOR NIGHTCAPS WITH YOU.

42:09.858 --> 42:11.730
Good night, Jack.
 GOOD NIGHT.

42:11.730 --> 42:14.202
(footsteps approach,
cell phone beeps)

42:14.202 --> 42:16.264
AH, YOU MADE IT.

42:16.264 --> 42:18.937
THANKS FOR MEETING WITH ME,
MS. DAVIS.

42:18.937 --> 42:20.639
IT'S LYDIA.

42:20.639 --> 42:24.312
AND BELIEVE ME,
THE PLEASURE IS ALL MINE.
