I always wanted to do that

Let's go, let's go.

Hey, DUFF queen, wanna show me
some of them moves?

ARTHUR: Bianca?
BIANCA: Yes.

58:10.600 --> 58:12.921

58:13.080 --> 58:15.970

Step into my hallway.

58:21.640 --> 58:25.087
I don't play favorites,
but you're my favorite.

58:26.240 --> 58:29.767
You ever heard the phrase
"The pen is mightier than the sword"?

58:29.920 --> 58:31.763
Yeah, and in this case,

58:31.920 --> 58:34.969
a bunch of kids anonymously typing
whatever comments they want

58:35.120 --> 58:36.645
feels like an atomic bomb,

58:36.800 --> 58:39.770
and that's definitely mightier
than a sword.

58:39.920 --> 58:43.561
So make your writing
have a positive effect.

58:43.720 --> 58:46.530

that's due.

58:46.680 --> 58:49.047
Oh, please, Mr. Arthur,

58:49.200 --> 58:51.601
the last thing I wanna do
is go to a place

58:51.760 --> 58:53.922
where everybody hates me
and then write about it.

58:54.080 --> 58:55.969
I picked you for a reason.

58:56.120 --> 59:00.091
And whatever you write, I'm running it
as our lead, so make it count.
