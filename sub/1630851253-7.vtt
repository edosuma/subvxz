00:14.791 --> 00:16.250
[crickets chirping]

00:34.875 --> 00:36.416
[gasps]

00:38.000 --> 00:39.041
[breathing heavily]

02:15.875 --> 02:17.833
[hesitating] Did it hurt you?

02:20.541 --> 02:21.375
Yes.

02:21.458 --> 02:22.500
[Father Paul sighs]

02:29.000 --> 02:30.250
[banging at door]

02:42.791 --> 02:43.958
[man screams]

02:44.833 --> 02:46.291
[all grunting]

02:47.416 --> 02:50.041
-[exclaims]
-[man continues screaming]

02:51.041 --> 02:52.125
[clamoring]

02:55.375 --> 02:56.333
[bites]

03:04.458 --> 03:05.875
[clamoring continues]

03:07.416 --> 03:08.541
[woman 1 screeches]

03:12.875 --> 03:15.875
No! No!

03:20.333 --> 03:21.708
[woman 2 screams]

03:26.291 --> 03:27.916
[woman 3 exclaims]

03:30.708 --> 03:32.375
[man grunts]

03:39.916 --> 03:41.166
[indistinct shouting]

03:46.166 --> 03:47.500
[man screams]

03:49.375 --> 03:51.166
They're pulling people
out of their houses.

03:51.250 --> 03:53.541
-We've got to get out of here.
-Where are we gonna go?

03:53.625 --> 03:56.875
To the church to get my son.
He's still in the church.

03:56.958 --> 03:58.958
-What did they do to him?
-Eddie--

03:59.041 --> 04:00.500
-What happened to Dad?
-What did they do?

04:00.583 --> 04:03.083
-I don't know.
-You said you studied this thing.

04:03.166 --> 04:04.375
You said you had samples.

04:04.458 --> 04:06.625
-[Sarah] I didn't. I don't know.
-Be quiet. Quiet.

04:08.250 --> 04:09.958
[woman screaming in distance]

04:18.333 --> 04:20.000
[screaming continues faintly]

04:27.541 --> 04:28.916
Does anyone have service?

04:36.500 --> 04:39.416
No. They must've knocked
the cell tower out.

04:39.500 --> 04:41.541
[Annie] And they sent the ferries away.

04:42.166 --> 04:44.416
[Sarah] Sturge was messing with the boats.
We saw him today.

04:44.500 --> 04:48.166
Boats, phones, power.
They're cutting us off.

04:48.250 --> 04:51.875
-Boats.
-I have a canoe by the Uppards.

04:52.833 --> 04:55.333
I mean, I don't think
it gets anybody to the mainland,

04:55.416 --> 04:57.291
but off the island, at least.

04:57.375 --> 05:01.125
My parents… They're out there.
They'd have to come with us, right?

05:02.041 --> 05:03.791
Get them to a doctor. There's room.

05:03.875 --> 05:07.083
-On the fishing boats, there's room.
-That's not what I'm talking about.

05:07.166 --> 05:08.833
She's not talking about leaving.

05:08.916 --> 05:11.125
[Erin] 'Cause they'd come after us,
like Bev said.

05:11.708 --> 05:13.375
That's why they didn't sink 'em.

05:13.458 --> 05:17.208
That's why they just pulled some plugs.
Because they need the boats.

05:18.416 --> 05:22.000
So they can leave… after.

05:25.250 --> 05:27.166
Sarah, you said it was a contagion.

05:28.708 --> 05:32.375
If just one of them,
just one of them makes it to the mainland…

06:05.875 --> 06:07.083
What's this gonna do?

06:09.625 --> 06:12.166
What's any of this gonna do?
The guns and knives?

06:15.166 --> 06:16.250
They get back up.

06:17.458 --> 06:20.375
You saw, they… This isn't the way.

06:21.208 --> 06:22.458
This is never the way.

06:23.833 --> 06:24.833
[Erin] Maybe not.

06:27.416 --> 06:29.000
Maybe it buys us a few more minutes.

06:30.333 --> 06:31.791
A few more minutes alive.

06:31.875 --> 06:32.833
[gun cylinder clicks]

06:33.958 --> 06:35.791
[Erin] And it might
come down to just minutes.

06:37.708 --> 06:38.708
Maybe seconds.

06:42.583 --> 06:44.291
[Annie] Never made much sense to me.

06:46.125 --> 06:47.541
We all say there's a heaven.

06:48.833 --> 06:50.083
And it's waiting for us.

06:51.958 --> 06:55.375
Then we claw, fight, beg

06:56.583 --> 06:58.458
for a few more minutes at the end.

06:59.958 --> 07:00.958
Minutes.

07:02.625 --> 07:04.125
It isn't about us anymore.

07:07.250 --> 07:08.916
It's about everyone else in the world.

07:12.458 --> 07:14.375
Dying for people we haven't even met.

07:16.958 --> 07:18.291
No greater love than that.

07:19.333 --> 07:21.166
What the Good Book says, isn't it?

07:24.708 --> 07:27.541
[sighs] First things,
we have to get you kids to safety.

07:27.625 --> 07:28.708
-No, we can help.
-No.

07:28.791 --> 07:31.041
-No.
-Please, no.

07:32.416 --> 07:35.416
What if we head to the beach
and hug the shoreline to the Uppards,

07:35.500 --> 07:37.500
and you take the canoe
and you paddle out--

07:41.333 --> 07:42.333
Again.

07:48.416 --> 07:49.708
Erin Greene!

07:50.333 --> 07:53.125
I'd like to finish our discussion!

07:55.166 --> 07:57.166
-Maybe she's not--
-She's in there.

08:02.916 --> 08:04.000
[exhales]

08:15.958 --> 08:16.958
No.

08:18.500 --> 08:21.291
You go. You get those children to safety.

08:22.416 --> 08:24.000
I'd like a word with Bev.

08:24.083 --> 08:24.958
Mom!

08:27.500 --> 08:30.000
-I love you.
-Mom!

08:30.083 --> 08:32.208
-So much.
-Mom!

08:32.875 --> 08:33.791
Go.

08:39.333 --> 08:40.333
[exhales]

08:45.375 --> 08:47.500
No quarrel with you, Annie Flynn.

08:48.250 --> 08:50.833
I just want to have
a little chat with Erin Greene.

08:50.916 --> 08:52.750
And Sarah Gunning.

08:53.375 --> 08:56.916
Maybe that terror-loving sheriff,
if he's still with them.

08:57.000 --> 08:59.708
Yeah. They're all in there.

09:01.208 --> 09:04.208
-Two children too.
-[Bev] The children will be fine.

09:04.875 --> 09:06.416
They're already saved.

09:07.208 --> 09:11.041
You don't think I would put those children
in any real danger, do you?

09:12.833 --> 09:15.958
What's that for, Annie?
Please don't tell me that's for us.

09:16.041 --> 09:18.375
-We're past all of that now.
-[Annie] It's not.

09:21.958 --> 09:23.583
Bev, I want you to listen to me.

09:25.208 --> 09:27.875
Because your whole life,
I think you've needed to hear this.

09:29.041 --> 09:30.583
You aren't a good person.

09:34.208 --> 09:35.250
Well…

09:36.833 --> 09:38.083
That was uncalled for.

09:38.166 --> 09:40.708
God doesn't love you
more than anyone else.

09:42.208 --> 09:43.458
You aren't a hero.

09:44.375 --> 09:48.041
And you certainly,
certainly aren't a victim.

09:48.666 --> 09:50.458
I wouldn't lecture, Annie Flynn.

09:51.333 --> 09:55.791
Not until you pull the plank
from your own eye, as it were.

09:55.875 --> 09:59.875
I hate to speak ill of the dead,
but if Riley Flynn,

10:00.541 --> 10:03.541
a drunk and a murderer,

10:03.625 --> 10:06.250
was evidence
of the quality of his parenting--

10:06.333 --> 10:07.333
He was.

10:09.333 --> 10:10.750
Every part of him.

10:13.916 --> 10:15.416
God loves him.

10:17.083 --> 10:19.041
Just as much as he loves you, Bev.

10:21.500 --> 10:23.416
Why does that upset you so much?

10:25.041 --> 10:30.041
Just the idea that God loves everyone
just as much as you.

10:30.625 --> 10:32.875
She's stalling. Check around back.

10:37.291 --> 10:38.291
[Bev] Jesus!

10:39.083 --> 10:42.083
[shushes] It's okay.
You're gonna be all right, Annie.

10:42.166 --> 10:45.375
Look at me.
You'll be up and about in no time.

10:45.458 --> 10:46.375
You'll be…

11:17.166 --> 11:18.250
[Father Paul] Sparrows.

11:18.958 --> 11:22.791
In the Bible it says,
"The sparrow will not fall to the ground,

11:22.875 --> 11:27.875
not even a sparrow, without God knowing."
He feels every death.

11:31.000 --> 11:35.750
I was in South America,
in my youth, on a mission,

11:35.833 --> 11:37.833
and I stood beneath this

11:39.375 --> 11:40.958
great waterfall.

11:42.416 --> 11:46.041
The scale of it. The weight of it…

11:49.458 --> 11:52.583
The roar of it, it drowned out
every noise in the jungle.

11:52.666 --> 11:57.166
Every bird and every voice.
And then when I was older,

11:57.250 --> 12:01.666
I thought about death,
how many deaths occur every second…

12:04.250 --> 12:07.041
There's people, animals, sparrows.

12:07.833 --> 12:12.750
If every drop of water
in that waterfall were a death,

12:13.416 --> 12:18.000
I thought, "Oh. That must be
what it's like for God."

12:21.958 --> 12:25.916
Every moment of every hour
of every day, a deluge of death,

12:26.000 --> 12:28.958
so loud, how could he hear

12:29.958 --> 12:35.416
my whispered prayers
over that thundering roar of deaths?

12:35.500 --> 12:39.083
When I saw what I'd been given, I thought,

12:39.166 --> 12:43.958
"Oh. Well, this is the end of that.
It's the end of the roar."

12:46.208 --> 12:47.333
No more death.

12:53.416 --> 12:57.583
But if I'm honest, and there's no point
in being anything else anymore,

12:57.666 --> 12:58.791
it was you.

13:01.250 --> 13:04.791
It was you. And Sarah.
That's why I did it.

13:05.750 --> 13:08.750
[sniffs] That's why
I put that thing in that trunk.

13:08.833 --> 13:11.791
That's why I bribed and lied
and smuggled it back here.

13:11.875 --> 13:15.416
That was the reason. [voice breaking]
I didn't want you to die.

13:26.791 --> 13:30.208
The rest of them too, of course, but, no…

13:31.666 --> 13:35.875
I didn't want you and Sarah…

13:36.458 --> 13:38.625
I mean, our whole lives have been wasted.

13:39.125 --> 13:42.000
[crying] You know,
just staring across the church.

13:42.875 --> 13:45.125
Too scared to come down and be with you.

13:45.208 --> 13:48.000
I mean, too scared
to tell our own daughter the truth.

13:48.083 --> 13:49.083
[sniffles]

13:51.750 --> 13:54.041
And it never felt like a sin,
that was the thing.

13:54.125 --> 13:58.125
You never felt like a sin,
and our daughter, she was never a sin.

13:58.208 --> 13:59.833
She was never a mistake.

14:01.041 --> 14:02.083
Never.

14:05.791 --> 14:06.666
[inhales sharply]

14:08.750 --> 14:10.750
-What could we have done?
-Mmm-hmm.

14:12.333 --> 14:13.166
John.

14:14.541 --> 14:17.041
-It was a different world.
-Well…

14:18.041 --> 14:19.291
[hesitating]

14:20.083 --> 14:23.083
I used to tell myself…
I'd tell myself, um…

14:25.083 --> 14:28.750
on those hard nights
when you were so close,

14:28.833 --> 14:32.083
sleeping beside the man
you were supposed to be with, that you…

14:35.083 --> 14:36.208
that you…

14:36.291 --> 14:40.708
If you would just show up and ask me,
I would have taken this collar off

14:41.458 --> 14:43.208
and I would have gone with you.

14:45.333 --> 14:47.291
I would go with you anywhere in the world.

14:50.958 --> 14:53.458
I was never going to do that, John.

14:55.416 --> 14:58.166
Not to you. Or to her.

14:58.250 --> 14:59.250
[sniffles]

15:00.000 --> 15:03.291
And not to him. Not after the war.

15:04.125 --> 15:06.333
I wasn't gonna ruin four lives.

15:09.958 --> 15:12.000
But that's over now, John.

15:13.833 --> 15:15.500
We made our choices.

15:16.500 --> 15:17.875
We lived our lives.

15:19.416 --> 15:24.375
She grew up and we faded away,
and that's how it's supposed to work.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.458
It's supposed to be over.

15:32.583 --> 15:34.125
Yeah, but another chance?

15:36.791 --> 15:40.250
Now that we can be a family this time.

15:42.500 --> 15:48.000
Can you think of a miracle
more amazing than that?

15:48.083 --> 15:52.708
I mean, curing… Cure blindness, sure.

15:52.791 --> 15:54.375
Or part the seas, all right.

15:54.916 --> 15:58.541
But a second chance? [chuckles softly]

16:00.625 --> 16:02.166
That's a real miracle.

16:10.791 --> 16:12.625
[angel roars]

16:13.250 --> 16:14.458
[wings flap]

16:20.000 --> 16:23.125
-[glass shatters]
-[man screams]

16:27.250 --> 16:30.666
[woman] Help! Someone help!

16:30.750 --> 16:34.416
-My husband! Help me!
-[shushes]

16:34.500 --> 16:36.625
-Quiet.
-[woman] Help! Help me!

16:36.708 --> 16:38.958
-[Sarah] We have to go. Now.
-[woman] Someone help me!

16:39.583 --> 16:42.083
-[man] Hey, Flynn.
-[woman] Help me, please!

16:43.375 --> 16:44.541
[man] You guys smell good.

16:45.875 --> 16:48.500
Like… you smell amazing.

16:48.583 --> 16:49.666
Back up.

16:52.625 --> 16:53.541
Raghead.

17:00.291 --> 17:02.625
[woman] Help! Help me!

17:03.250 --> 17:06.708
Help! Help!

17:08.875 --> 17:09.833
[screams]

17:11.958 --> 17:14.000
[roars]

17:14.083 --> 17:15.541
[woman screeches]

17:19.000 --> 17:21.166
-[Wade] Leeza.
-Daddy?

17:22.291 --> 17:23.333
Daddy.

17:24.291 --> 17:25.375
[Erin] Run!

17:27.333 --> 17:28.750
[Leeza screams]

17:28.833 --> 17:30.000
[man exclaims]

17:30.083 --> 17:31.208
[Hassan exclaims]

17:34.125 --> 17:35.458
Go, run!

17:36.708 --> 17:37.875
[Hassan] Run!

17:59.791 --> 18:01.333
Why did she do that?

18:01.416 --> 18:02.500
It doesn't matter.

18:05.708 --> 18:07.083
[Sturge] We gotta put out this fire.

18:10.666 --> 18:11.750
I don't know.

18:14.083 --> 18:16.000
If it gets goin' too big, it could…

18:17.541 --> 18:21.166
I mean, the whole island.
With this wind it's like a tinderbox.

18:21.250 --> 18:23.541
The whole thing
could burn to nothin' like in '84.

18:23.625 --> 18:26.250
Not the whole island.
It'd take more than the west bank

18:26.333 --> 18:28.291
to do the whole thing, and even then…

18:30.625 --> 18:33.000
I mean, the church didn't burn in '84.

18:39.791 --> 18:40.916
Revelation.

18:43.416 --> 18:47.791
"The first Angel blew his trumpet
and there came hail and fire

18:47.875 --> 18:50.791
mixed with the blood,
and they were hurled to the Earth."

18:50.875 --> 18:56.625
"And a third of the Earth was burned up,
and a third of the trees were burned up,

18:56.708 --> 19:00.416
and all of the green grass was burned up."

19:00.500 --> 19:05.583
"As for the cowardly, the faithless,

19:05.666 --> 19:10.791
the polluted, the murderers,
the fornicators, the sorcerers,

19:10.875 --> 19:16.083
idolaters and all of the liars,
their place will be in the lake that burns

19:16.166 --> 19:21.291
with fire and sulfur,
which is the second death." Let it burn.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.875
Let all of it burn.

19:29.041 --> 19:30.208
A new flood.

19:32.541 --> 19:39.250
A flood of fire,
and St. Patrick's will be the ark.

19:40.708 --> 19:43.833
The citizens of Crockett,
the good citizens,

19:43.916 --> 19:46.625
they know where to go in a storm.

19:48.333 --> 19:50.291
Pick that up. Come with me.

20:35.708 --> 20:36.791
What's the point?

20:40.166 --> 20:41.166
Minutes.

20:57.750 --> 21:01.625
In case there's a boat,
maybe with an engine.

21:01.708 --> 21:03.333
A speedboat or something.

21:04.291 --> 21:05.625
We're gonna be okay.

21:05.708 --> 21:07.250
You think we're gonna make it?

21:08.958 --> 21:12.625
That's not what I said.
I'm saying, either way,

21:13.625 --> 21:14.750
we're gonna be okay.

21:16.583 --> 21:17.416
Okay.

21:46.208 --> 21:47.250
[indistinct chatter]

21:53.791 --> 21:55.041
[Annie panting]

21:59.750 --> 22:01.041
[sobs]

22:11.250 --> 22:12.458
It's all mine.

22:13.166 --> 22:15.666
Same. It's all mine too.

22:16.708 --> 22:19.666
They're… What they're doin' to people…

22:20.250 --> 22:21.416
But not you.

22:21.500 --> 22:24.750
-No, not me.
-Of course not.

22:27.791 --> 22:29.791
I can feel it already though, Ed.

22:31.833 --> 22:34.125
-My stomach hurts.
-I know.

22:35.583 --> 22:36.583
I feel it.

22:40.000 --> 22:43.875
Is that what I'll become,
just an animal who can't resist?

22:45.000 --> 22:46.416
When I saw them at the church,

22:46.500 --> 22:49.125
I thought it was something
they really couldn't help.

22:50.375 --> 22:54.583
Like… something impossible not to do.

22:55.458 --> 22:56.958
But it isn't, Annie.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.250
I feel it too.

23:01.875 --> 23:04.041
I'm starving too,

23:05.208 --> 23:07.875
but I didn't. I didn't.

23:09.291 --> 23:10.916
Whatever this is,

23:12.125 --> 23:13.625
it don't change who you are.

23:14.208 --> 23:15.833
-[woman screams]
-[Annie gasps]

23:17.958 --> 23:19.500
[exclaims]

23:24.583 --> 23:25.791
[Sarah] They're burning it down.

23:27.750 --> 23:30.208
Why would they do that?
That doesn't make any sense.

23:46.583 --> 23:48.416
I hope the kids made it to the boat.

23:50.083 --> 23:51.291
I hope so too.

23:54.666 --> 23:56.125
We're never gonna know, are we?

23:57.166 --> 23:58.166
Probably not.

24:00.791 --> 24:01.708
They did.

24:04.583 --> 24:06.125
I'm deciding they did.

24:37.625 --> 24:39.708
[wind blows]

24:43.833 --> 24:45.000
[Wade] Leeza!

24:46.791 --> 24:49.625
Leeza, honey, it's Daddy!

24:51.583 --> 24:54.500
If you can hear me,
follow my voice! Leeza, please!

24:57.000 --> 24:58.000
[Dolly] Leeza!

24:59.583 --> 25:01.000
Leeza, honey!

25:05.708 --> 25:07.833
-Leeza, honey!
-[Wade] Leeza, honey, please!

25:07.916 --> 25:10.333
-[Leeza coughs]
-[man] It's okay. You can come out.

25:13.500 --> 25:16.125
-[flies buzzing]
-[Warren groans]

25:37.166 --> 25:38.458
[breath trembling]

25:46.416 --> 25:47.833
[angel slurping]

25:55.333 --> 25:56.458
[Leeza gasps]

25:57.333 --> 25:58.500
[woman sobs]

26:09.583 --> 26:10.750
[softly] Stop it. Stop.

26:19.000 --> 26:20.791
[Leeza breathing heavily]

26:20.875 --> 26:22.416
[woman continues sobbing]

26:25.875 --> 26:27.375
[growls]

27:11.833 --> 27:13.708
[angel screeches]

27:21.375 --> 27:22.416
[Sturge] Leeza Scarborough!

27:23.875 --> 27:25.416
Your father's worried sick.

27:26.625 --> 27:27.500
Leeza!

27:38.125 --> 27:41.791
Spread the word.
Anyone not in the rec center by sunrise

27:41.875 --> 27:43.250
won't see another.

27:44.291 --> 27:47.916
Hit the empties,
the trailers, everything. All of it.

27:48.916 --> 27:50.083
Dawn's a-comin'.

28:36.666 --> 28:37.875
[fire blazes]

29:01.625 --> 29:02.916
[bell tolling]

29:16.666 --> 29:18.041
[tolling fades]

29:25.833 --> 29:27.458
Oh. You're up.

29:28.250 --> 29:29.291
Praise be.

29:30.666 --> 29:31.875
And you too.

29:33.500 --> 29:36.791
Monsignor, you are a stronger soul than I,

29:36.875 --> 29:41.333
but if you forgive men their trespass,
the Heavenly Father will also forgive you.

29:41.416 --> 29:43.500
So who am I to judge?

29:44.791 --> 29:46.083
Still, though.

29:46.583 --> 29:49.208
-You let them out.
-[Bev] Of course I did.

29:50.500 --> 29:52.500
Come. Let me show you.

30:03.416 --> 30:06.791
"He blotted out every living thing
on the face of the ground."

30:06.875 --> 30:12.833
"Human beings, animals, creeping things,
birds of the sky. They were blotted out."

30:12.916 --> 30:16.833
"Only Noah was left
for those who were with him on the ark."

30:17.375 --> 30:21.750
St. Patrick's isn't just a church,
Monsignor. It's an ark.

30:22.916 --> 30:25.708
I set up cots in the rec center
for those who were chosen.

30:25.791 --> 30:28.875
We will take to our ships,
to our vessels, and then,

30:28.958 --> 30:30.708
like sheep among wolves, like you said,

30:31.625 --> 30:33.666
we will spread the good word.

30:33.750 --> 30:36.958
And… and who will decide who is chosen?

30:38.125 --> 30:40.375
We will. You and me.

30:41.416 --> 30:45.041
-And what happens to the rest?
-Well, I don't much know.

30:45.750 --> 30:47.125
That isn't up to me.

30:48.083 --> 30:50.041
It's between them and God, isn't it?

30:51.250 --> 30:52.083
No.

30:53.291 --> 30:54.125
I'm sorry?

30:55.000 --> 30:56.333
No, we got this wrong.

30:56.833 --> 30:59.583
-Don't be ridiculous.
-No, Beverly, please look at them.

31:00.166 --> 31:02.791
-We are the wolves.
-[Bev] No.

31:04.666 --> 31:08.708
No, please. Not you too.
Not you, Monsignor.

31:09.666 --> 31:14.375
I was wrong. We were wrong.
We are wrong. And this needs to stop.

31:15.083 --> 31:16.166
They need leadership.

31:16.833 --> 31:20.750
Look at them. They're lost
without a leader, without a shepherd.

31:20.833 --> 31:25.750
That must be you, Monsignor.
It has to be you. It has always been you.

31:25.833 --> 31:28.958
No! It was never me.
That's the thing about priesthood.

31:29.041 --> 31:32.625
It's never supposed to be about me.
It's supposed to be about God!

31:42.416 --> 31:45.750
Well, I suppose it isn't you anymore.

31:47.708 --> 31:49.458
Of course, he told us that, didn't he?

31:50.583 --> 31:54.083
Jesus himself. He warned us
against the scribes, against the priests.

31:54.708 --> 31:58.250
In Matthew. "Do not call
anyone on Earth 'father,'

31:58.333 --> 32:01.208
you have one father, and he is in heaven."

32:02.833 --> 32:07.708
"Woe to you,
scribes, Pharisees, hypocrites!"

32:07.791 --> 32:09.375
Viper's brood.

32:10.375 --> 32:13.041
But you, Monsignor…

32:16.375 --> 32:19.791
Monsignor Pruitt,
did it have to be true of you?

32:22.000 --> 32:26.666
I suppose virtue isn't a virtue
if it doesn't cost you anything.

32:28.666 --> 32:31.125
And it was always going this way.
You were always…

32:32.500 --> 32:36.375
You were always gonna be the last,
the hardest, test of my faith. You.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.583
"Get thee behind me."

32:44.541 --> 32:46.833
"You are a stumbling block to me,

32:46.916 --> 32:52.500
for you are setting your mind not
on divine things, but on human things."

32:54.750 --> 32:56.166
Babylon the Great.

32:57.416 --> 33:01.666
Mother of whores
and all of Earth's abominations.

33:02.708 --> 33:07.416
I truly hope you two enjoy the sunrise.

33:30.458 --> 33:31.750
-[Sturge] What's wrong?
-Nothing.

33:33.791 --> 33:36.750
We're ready for them.
Hold them outside a few more minutes.

33:36.833 --> 33:38.208
We need an accurate head count

33:38.291 --> 33:40.083
so we know how many boats
we need tomorrow.

33:40.166 --> 33:41.375
They burned the boats.

33:43.416 --> 33:44.416
They what?

33:45.583 --> 33:46.916
They burned 'em.

33:49.625 --> 33:51.541
That's… no matter.

33:52.875 --> 33:57.208
Wade will call back the ferries.
He'll just call them back when it's time.

34:00.583 --> 34:01.583
They who?

34:13.041 --> 34:14.291
[distant explosion]

34:23.541 --> 34:26.875
I love you, Mom. I love you, Dad.

34:31.041 --> 34:32.000
[exhales]

34:33.833 --> 34:36.375
Lord, keep them safe.

34:37.833 --> 34:38.750
And watch over them.

34:41.041 --> 34:45.541
And touch their hearts,
and make it so they won't worry.

34:48.666 --> 34:51.791
Lord, bring my parents peace.

34:56.291 --> 34:57.291
Amen.

34:58.875 --> 34:59.875
My mom.

35:02.250 --> 35:03.416
And my dad.

35:07.375 --> 35:09.791
And my brother.

35:13.041 --> 35:14.708
They're all gone, aren't they?

35:15.916 --> 35:16.833
Yeah.

35:20.541 --> 35:22.583
[Warren] I would have…

35:25.125 --> 35:28.041
If I'd known at that dinner,
the last dinner,

35:28.125 --> 35:30.166
-I would have been different.
-They know.

35:33.875 --> 35:34.875
They know.

35:42.541 --> 35:43.708
[canoe thuds]

35:59.416 --> 36:01.000
Hey. Who's that now?

36:02.500 --> 36:03.583
Is that Howard?

36:04.875 --> 36:06.250
Howard Hobbs.

36:06.875 --> 36:10.041
Look at the state of you.
Must have had a hell of a time of it,

36:10.125 --> 36:11.958
you poor man.

36:12.458 --> 36:17.583
You know, I don't think
I ever saw you at mass a day in your life,

36:17.666 --> 36:21.458
and yet you were
blessed tonight, weren't you?

36:22.208 --> 36:23.208
Saved.

36:23.916 --> 36:27.125
Baptized, I take it. You?

36:28.791 --> 36:30.750
I killed my Julie tonight.

36:32.125 --> 36:33.375
[Bev] You killed your wife?

36:34.250 --> 36:36.958
[Howard] And my boys. I killed my boys.

36:37.916 --> 36:39.083
[sobs]

36:41.083 --> 36:45.750
You know, I hate to tell you this,
but you could have brought them back,

36:46.333 --> 36:48.958
just as Sturge
apparently brought you back,

36:49.041 --> 36:53.375
which was something we discussed
only doing in rare and specific…

36:53.458 --> 36:57.375
It's fine. But, yes,
you could have saved them.

36:57.458 --> 37:02.041
Easily, in fact,
if you had been a man of faith.

37:03.875 --> 37:06.458
I don't know what's happening.
What's happening?

37:07.041 --> 37:08.500
It's the end, Mr. Hobbs.

37:09.500 --> 37:10.916
The end of all things.

37:11.000 --> 37:14.875
And all those days
you decided not to worship,

37:14.958 --> 37:17.791
all those days
you turned your back on God.

37:17.875 --> 37:22.166
Well, the tools for your salvation
were always there.

37:22.250 --> 37:25.208
The doors were
always open, but you didn't…

37:26.166 --> 37:27.000
[sighs]

37:28.125 --> 37:30.000
Well, you just didn't.

37:30.750 --> 37:36.500
So, yes, in the critical hour,
you didn't know.

37:38.583 --> 37:39.916
They're with God now.

37:41.250 --> 37:42.416
Take heart in that.

37:44.166 --> 37:47.625
I wish you peace and God's mercy.

37:50.583 --> 37:52.583
No room for him inside, I'm afraid.

37:54.166 --> 37:55.791
I saved him, Bev.

37:58.333 --> 37:59.750
He was always nice to me.

38:08.708 --> 38:11.208
I'm sorry, Howie. I'm sorry.

38:13.166 --> 38:14.750
I was thinkin' maybe, um,

38:16.375 --> 38:18.125
just go for a walk?

38:19.541 --> 38:22.708
Down by the shore? You like the water.

38:23.708 --> 38:25.750
I know you do. Maybe…

38:28.750 --> 38:32.166
That you can just watch the sunrise.

38:33.333 --> 38:34.208
Huh?

38:35.250 --> 38:36.333
[sobs]

38:43.041 --> 38:45.500
[Sturge] God'll be with you,
Howie, I promise.

38:46.083 --> 38:47.166
This is monstrous.

38:47.250 --> 38:49.125
[Howard continues sobbing]

38:52.458 --> 38:54.458
[woman] Hey. Hey.

38:56.083 --> 38:56.916
Bring him in!

38:59.416 --> 39:00.791
You follow me, son.

39:02.083 --> 39:04.000
You're welcome in St. Patrick's.

39:05.083 --> 39:06.250
All are welcome!

39:07.875 --> 39:10.958
All have to be welcome
or this isn't really God's house!

39:11.958 --> 39:13.375
[liquid splashing]

39:13.458 --> 39:15.125
[breathing heavily]

39:32.625 --> 39:33.458
Good.

39:37.750 --> 39:40.541
You go out the back,
through the vestibule. Head for the water.

39:42.166 --> 39:43.500
That was the idea.

39:46.000 --> 39:47.416
God, am I proud of you.

39:47.500 --> 39:51.375
I'm sorry that we never told you,
your mother and I, but I…

39:52.625 --> 39:53.958
I love you so much.

39:54.791 --> 39:56.541
And I've been so proud of you,

39:56.625 --> 40:00.291
and I just wish
that we had gotten to know each other.

40:04.458 --> 40:05.458
Me too.

40:08.166 --> 40:10.583
-Head out the back. I'll take care of--
-[gunshot]

40:18.458 --> 40:19.750
[Sturge] She was gonna…

40:21.625 --> 40:22.625
[grunts]

40:25.541 --> 40:26.625
[both grunting]

40:39.500 --> 40:40.541
John.

40:44.708 --> 40:45.791
John?

40:54.375 --> 40:55.666
[woman exclaims]

40:55.750 --> 40:59.208
Baby! Honey! Oh, my God! No!

41:00.000 --> 41:03.375
[sobbing] No! Sarah! Sarah!

41:03.458 --> 41:07.500
Look at me. No. Sarah, baby.

41:07.583 --> 41:08.541
[sobs]

41:15.833 --> 41:16.666
John.

41:21.083 --> 41:23.541
It's okay. There. There.

41:23.625 --> 41:24.833
[gurgles]

41:25.458 --> 41:27.666
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

41:27.750 --> 41:29.625
-It's okay.
-[spits]

41:31.833 --> 41:33.041
[sobs]

41:33.125 --> 41:34.416
[Sarah breathing heavily]

41:38.666 --> 41:39.958
[woman gasps]

41:42.916 --> 41:45.500
No! No! No!

41:47.625 --> 41:50.916
My baby girl. Oh, God.

42:01.916 --> 42:03.583
When she was a little girl…

42:05.625 --> 42:11.500
her favorite place on the whole island
was that little bridge by the marsh.

42:14.375 --> 42:16.583
That little… That little bridge.

43:00.083 --> 43:01.583
[Bev] Stop!

43:03.041 --> 43:04.291
[Hassan groans]

43:06.041 --> 43:08.291
[Bev] You disgusting viper!

43:08.958 --> 43:11.166
You would burn us in our homes?

43:11.250 --> 43:14.166
I knew the day you set foot
on this island,

43:14.250 --> 43:17.375
of course you would, of course you would.

43:18.125 --> 43:19.166
Terrorist.

43:21.208 --> 43:24.125
[Hassan] I just can't let you have
that building. That's all.

43:25.458 --> 43:28.500
[groans] I'm pretty sure
it's the last one left.

43:30.500 --> 43:31.541
[breathing heavily]

43:37.208 --> 43:38.250
Hungry, huh?

43:40.416 --> 43:41.750
Dirty blood.

43:43.333 --> 43:44.291
Wow.

43:44.375 --> 43:46.875
Surprised you didn't wait
till we were all inside,

43:46.958 --> 43:48.750
so you could really have your fun.

43:49.666 --> 43:52.541
Surprised you made your move
when it was empty, coward.

43:53.666 --> 43:55.000
It's not though, is it?

43:56.125 --> 43:57.291
Empty, I mean.

44:02.875 --> 44:04.875
[angel roars]

44:07.416 --> 44:08.958
[Erin screams]

44:09.041 --> 44:10.416
No!

44:11.125 --> 44:12.125
[screams]

44:14.958 --> 44:17.041
[slurping]

44:29.625 --> 44:30.541
Hey.

44:34.583 --> 44:35.416
Boy.

44:35.500 --> 44:37.125
[panting]

44:39.750 --> 44:40.583
[Bev] No.

44:42.083 --> 44:43.333
[crowd gasps]

45:00.583 --> 45:04.333
[Hassan] There's this verse in the Bible,
just kind of stuck with me.

45:05.416 --> 45:08.791
"He makes the sun rise
on the evil and the good."

45:08.875 --> 45:10.125
-[gunshot]
-[gasps]

45:10.875 --> 45:11.791
[Ali] Dad!

45:13.458 --> 45:14.375
Dad.

45:16.083 --> 45:17.125
Dad, get up.

45:17.208 --> 45:18.708
[Erin breathing heavily]

45:42.875 --> 45:44.041
[angel grunts]

45:54.916 --> 45:56.125
[Hassan grunting]

46:00.666 --> 46:04.625
[Bev] There's gotta be somewhere…
There's gotta be somewhere else.

46:04.708 --> 46:07.250
No, Bev. No. There's nowhere else.

46:08.625 --> 46:12.666
-You burned it. You burned it all.
-[Bev] No, no, I…

46:14.333 --> 46:18.083
We should be looking for Leeza.
Let's go find Leeza.

46:21.125 --> 46:22.041
Leeza.

46:23.916 --> 46:25.333
[indistinct chatter]

46:27.875 --> 46:29.541
Where else can we go?

46:29.625 --> 46:31.333
-There's got to be somewhere else.
-There's not.

46:32.791 --> 46:35.958
-[Bev] The boats!
-[Sturge] Boats are gone, Bev.

46:43.833 --> 46:44.833
Hey, kid.

46:47.833 --> 46:48.833
Kid, you okay?

46:54.208 --> 46:55.125
I don't think so.

46:57.875 --> 46:59.041
I think I…

47:01.833 --> 47:03.958
I don't know, but I think I killed my mom.

47:06.625 --> 47:11.833
Yeah. I done some stuff tonight
that I feel… [clicks tongue]

47:15.208 --> 47:16.375
I done some stuff.

47:19.000 --> 47:20.291
Will you forgive me, kid?

47:24.500 --> 47:25.500
I'll forgive you.

47:29.625 --> 47:32.708
[Sturge] Come on. You too, Howie, come on.

47:43.916 --> 47:45.250
[Erin groans softly]

47:57.000 --> 47:58.083
[angel growls]

48:11.083 --> 48:12.625
[roars]

48:22.458 --> 48:23.375
[Ali] Just hang on.

48:24.958 --> 48:28.125
-[Hassan groans]
-[Ali] Dad. Dad.

48:31.375 --> 48:33.000
[Hassan breathing heavily]

48:36.875 --> 48:38.666
[angel roars]

48:47.583 --> 48:48.583
There.

48:50.833 --> 48:51.833
[angel roars]

48:53.416 --> 48:54.458
It's heading west.

48:56.166 --> 48:57.166
It's running.

48:57.916 --> 48:59.500
It's running from the sunrise.

49:01.083 --> 49:03.916
Do you think it can make it?
Before the sunrise?

49:06.166 --> 49:07.375
Thirty miles?

49:08.958 --> 49:10.666
I mean, that thing can barely fly.

49:13.541 --> 49:15.375
No, I… I don't think it can.

49:18.708 --> 49:20.000
[wind blows]

49:23.583 --> 49:24.750
[fire crackling]

49:33.833 --> 49:34.666
[Riley] What happens?

49:37.291 --> 49:38.500
[chuckles softly]

49:43.291 --> 49:44.125
What?

49:45.166 --> 49:46.083
[Riley] When we die.

49:47.416 --> 49:48.416
What happens?

49:50.875 --> 49:52.375
Yeah, what the fuck happens?

49:54.250 --> 49:56.500
So what do you think
happens when we die, Erin?

50:00.125 --> 50:01.375
Speaking for myself?

50:03.708 --> 50:04.916
Speaking for yourself.

50:12.041 --> 50:12.958
[sighs]

50:16.291 --> 50:20.333
Myself. My self.

50:22.083 --> 50:23.416
That's the problem.

50:24.583 --> 50:27.125
That's the whole problem
with the whole thing.

50:28.125 --> 50:30.958
That word, "self."

50:32.000 --> 50:33.541
That's not the word.

50:34.458 --> 50:36.166
That's not right, that isn't…

50:38.500 --> 50:39.750
That isn't.

50:41.375 --> 50:43.041
How did I forget that?

50:43.875 --> 50:45.208
When did I forget that?

50:47.708 --> 50:53.291
The body stops a cell at a time,
but the brain keeps firing those neurons.

50:54.208 --> 50:57.750
Little lightning bolts,
like fireworks inside,

50:57.833 --> 51:02.333
and I thought I'd despair or feel afraid,
but I don't feel any of that.

51:03.416 --> 51:04.416
None of it.

51:05.666 --> 51:07.041
Because I'm too busy.

51:08.250 --> 51:11.583
I'm too busy in this moment. Remembering.

51:15.625 --> 51:16.500
Of course.

51:17.583 --> 51:22.416
I remember that every atom in my body
was forged in a star.

51:24.791 --> 51:29.041
This matter, this body is
mostly just empty space after all,

51:29.125 --> 51:30.625
and solid matter?

51:31.458 --> 51:36.000
It's just energy vibrating very slowly
and there is no me.

51:36.708 --> 51:37.791
There never was.

51:40.125 --> 51:42.958
The electrons of my body mingle and dance

51:43.041 --> 51:47.583
with the electrons of the ground below me
and the air I'm no longer breathing.

51:48.750 --> 51:49.958
And I remember

51:51.500 --> 51:56.125
there is no point
where any of that ends and I begin.

51:59.500 --> 52:03.166
I remember I am energy. Not memory.

52:04.291 --> 52:05.291
Not self.

52:06.541 --> 52:10.083
My name, my personality,
my choices, all came after me.

52:11.250 --> 52:14.166
I was before them and I will be after,

52:14.750 --> 52:18.416
and everything else is pictures,
picked up along the way.

52:19.166 --> 52:24.291
Fleeting little dreamlets
printed on the tissue of my dying brain.

52:24.916 --> 52:30.875
And I am the lightning that jumps between.
I am the energy firing the neurons,

52:32.666 --> 52:34.208
and I'm returning.

52:35.333 --> 52:39.041
Just by remembering, I'm returning home.

52:42.333 --> 52:45.333
And it's like a drop of water
falling back into the ocean,

52:47.625 --> 52:50.291
of which it's always been a part.

52:51.916 --> 52:54.791
All things… a part.

52:55.291 --> 52:58.333
All of us… a part.

52:58.416 --> 53:02.875
You, me and my little girl,
and my mother and my father,

53:02.958 --> 53:08.625
everyone who's ever been,
every plant, every animal, every atom,

53:08.708 --> 53:11.958
every star, every galaxy, all of it.

53:13.708 --> 53:17.166
More galaxies in the universe
than grains of sand on the beach.

53:17.250 --> 53:21.750
And that's what we're talking about
when we say "God."

53:22.750 --> 53:23.666
The one.

53:24.958 --> 53:28.958
The cosmos and its infinite dreams.

53:30.750 --> 53:34.250
We are the cosmos dreaming of itself.

53:35.083 --> 53:38.958
It's simply a dream
that I think is my life, every time.

53:41.041 --> 53:43.791
But I'll forget this. I always do.

53:45.333 --> 53:47.083
I always forget my dreams.

53:51.000 --> 53:55.500
But now, in this split-second,
in the moment I remember,

53:55.583 --> 54:00.083
the instant I remember,
I comprehend everything at once.

54:01.458 --> 54:04.750
There is no time. There is no death.

54:05.416 --> 54:06.541
Life is a dream.

54:09.166 --> 54:10.166
It's a wish.

54:11.333 --> 54:13.250
Made again and again and again

54:13.333 --> 54:16.916
and again and again and again
and on into eternity.

54:18.416 --> 54:19.583
And I am all of it.

54:20.708 --> 54:22.666
I am everything. I am all.

54:26.125 --> 54:28.041
I am that I am.

54:39.000 --> 54:40.458
[inhales]

55:03.458 --> 55:05.166
[singing]

56:11.083 --> 56:13.208
[both praying in Arabic]

56:44.041 --> 56:45.500
[all singing]

56:58.541 --> 57:00.000
[singing continues]

58:17.916 --> 58:19.458
[sobbing]

58:23.666 --> 58:24.833
[screaming]

58:52.958 --> 58:53.875
Forgive me.

59:12.000 --> 59:13.750
[screaming]

59:20.750 --> 59:22.000
[singing stops]

1:00:07.250 --> 1:00:08.375
I can't feel my legs.

1:00:14.625 --> 1:00:15.625
[laughs softly]

1:00:27.125 --> 1:00:29.125
[water lapping softly]
