00:04.116 --> 00:06.420
- Previously on ER...
- We're closing down.

00:06.433 --> 00:08.388
- It's only temporary.
- How do you know?

00:08.443 --> 00:10.627
Old boys running around here
checking for cracks in the ceiling,

00:10.640 --> 00:11.818
and now we're having some dinner.

00:11.833 --> 00:14.378
Kovac probably just wants
to boost morale.

00:14.407 --> 00:16.908
How are we affording such a fancy place?
It's not Ladokern, is it?

00:16.917 --> 00:20.217
- Finally get things sorted out with Neela?
- There's nothing to sort out, man.

00:20.234 --> 00:23.316
Neela, I want you to say hi to Mae Lee Park.
She's our new surgical med student.

00:23.333 --> 00:25.077
- Hi! Nice to meet you.
- Heard a lot about you.

00:25.096 --> 00:28.800
I can smell a wedding a mile away,
Archie. It's like a sixth sense.

00:28.814 --> 00:31.463
It's in your eyes. You have
the glow. I can't wait for the glow.

00:31.477 --> 00:33.823
- It's the only on thing that he asked me.
- I can't wait to try on wedding dresses...

00:34.294 --> 00:36.222
If you tell anyone, I'll kill you.

Man, what you swinging at?
We're closed.

01:13.518 --> 01:15.172
Yeah, uh, I work here.

01:15.305 --> 01:18.133
Then you oughta know the ER's
shut down until further notice.

01:19.176 --> 01:22.501
I'm an R3. I left something
in my locker, do you mind?

01:25.208 --> 01:27.601
Go on.
You might need this.

02:14.255 --> 02:15.611
Just a second.

02:15.636 --> 02:18.063
Come on, Mayday,
we're gonna miss the canapes.

02:23.775 --> 02:25.910
- What are you doing here?
- I thought we'd go to this, uh...

02:25.965 --> 02:27.981
- ER shindig together.
- Oh.

02:28.876 --> 02:30.583
Or not. Wow.

02:30.607 --> 02:33.230
You look, uh... wow.

02:35.236 --> 02:36.722
Listen, I know things have been...

02:36.775 --> 02:39.651
a bit crazy with me and
our relationship is undefined but...

02:39.678 --> 02:41.863
Yeah, uh... we should talk.

02:42.155 --> 02:43.981
Yeah, maybe, um...

02:45.246 --> 02:47.540
I don't know maybe we can talk at dinner.

02:47.737 --> 02:49.373
Yeah, um...

02:50.127 --> 02:52.310
let me just get my stuff.

03:10.135 --> 03:11.513
Why are we here so early?

03:11.536 --> 03:14.970
Well, I'm the chief,
I thought I should be here first.

03:15.287 --> 03:16.871
You were the chief.

03:17.076 --> 03:19.582
Well, consider this my last official act.

03:20.055 --> 03:22.581
- The department dinner is here?
- Yep.

03:24.167 --> 03:27.831
Haven't been in a neighborhood like this since
the last time I tried to score some crack.

03:31.425 --> 03:34.571
- Budget cuts are getting serious, huh?
- Come on. It's different.

03:34.667 --> 03:36.671
- That's for sure.
- See this?

03:36.918 --> 03:38.502
Pretty cool, huh?

03:40.146 --> 03:45.020
- Is this a restaurant?
- No, no, it's a... it's a rental space.

03:45.138 --> 03:47.300
- A patient told me about it.
- Oh.

03:49.428 --> 03:52.670
And was she by any chance a porn star?

03:53.348 --> 03:56.703
- He is a music producer.
- Oh, so it is a drug den.

03:57.017 --> 03:59.331
And since when did
these things get so formal?

03:59.357 --> 04:01.361
It's fun -- people like
to dress up. And...

04:01.407 --> 04:02.361
- you know...
- Good evening.

04:02.376 --> 04:04.212
Doctor Kovac, Doctor Bobek's in back,

04:04.236 --> 04:07.210
and she needs you to make
a decision about the centerpieces.

04:08.268 --> 04:09.643
Big night, huh?

04:10.256 --> 04:12.693
- What's he talking about?
- Uh, Hope is here.

04:12.707 --> 04:15.121
She helped set everything up.

04:17.296 --> 04:19.411
What do you mean helped
set everything up?

04:20.817 --> 04:22.592
What do you think?

04:23.238 --> 04:26.152
Yay! Yay! Yay!

04:26.836 --> 04:28.152
- A wedding.
- No.

04:28.178 --> 04:29.171
- Are you the bride?
- Nope.

04:29.205 --> 04:32.533
This is Sophie, her dad's the caterer,
Abby, she's gonna be your flower girl.

04:32.555 --> 04:34.411
- Like hell she is.
- Abby!

04:34.857 --> 04:37.583
You're sure kidding me, right?
I mean you've got to be kidding me.

04:37.606 --> 04:40.230
- Can we just please talk about this?
- How do I get out of here?

04:40.245 --> 04:42.603
You're just nervous, that's why I did
it this way. It saves you the stress.

04:42.628 --> 04:45.111
Really? Do you think I look
particularly un-stressed right now?

04:45.128 --> 04:46.571
The cake's coming up,
where do you want it, doc?

04:46.587 --> 04:47.611
Check, check with Hope.

04:47.625 --> 04:50.232
How could you have ever imagined
I'd want to do it like this?

04:50.278 --> 04:53.280
Planning it was freaking you out, this
way, it's like ripping off a Band-Aid.

04:53.297 --> 04:56.041
Oh, man, you really know
how to melt a girl's heart.

04:56.078 --> 04:58.102
This is something we both want.

04:58.506 --> 05:00.240
Luka, it's crazy.

05:00.275 --> 05:03.071
We can do something for
our families later, tonight is for us.

05:03.088 --> 05:05.481
Yeah, what and a bunch of people from work?

05:05.505 --> 05:07.133
- Our friends.
- And look, what about the food,

05:07.147 --> 05:09.841
and what about the music and look at
this place it's like getting married

05:09.857 --> 05:11.813
- in a Meat Loaf video.
- I took care of everything.

05:11.837 --> 05:13.821
- Hope helped me.
- It's a labyrinth in here.

05:13.835 --> 05:16.671
Hey, hey, hey.
I love you.

05:17.066 --> 05:20.392
You love me.
Let's make it forever.

05:22.876 --> 05:24.332
Let's get married.

05:35.346 --> 05:38.030
Wow. ER rocks!

05:38.046 --> 05:40.801
We're gonna party like it's
New Year's in Mozambique.

05:40.835 --> 05:44.011
- Looks like somebody already started.
- Which way's the bar?

05:44.276 --> 05:47.512
- Uh, back there.
- I hope they got margaritas.

05:48.508 --> 05:50.280
Uh... this is nice.

05:52.637 --> 05:54.211
- Luka, look, I...
- Just give me ten minutes.

05:54.245 --> 05:56.221
Hey, hey, ten, ten minutes.

05:56.367 --> 05:58.060
Let me show you what I've done.

05:58.316 --> 06:00.982
If... if you don't like it, I'll take
you home. I promise.

06:10.006 --> 06:11.060
Come on.

06:13.146 --> 06:15.351
One foot after the other.

06:25.757 --> 06:27.623
Kinda looks like a Victoria's Secret ad.

06:27.635 --> 06:31.661
Oh, it's so pretty.
I love the way ER people do things.

06:31.776 --> 06:33.512
Is there something going on here we don't know about?

06:33.537 --> 06:35.851
Uh, no, you guy... hi.
Not, not over there.

06:35.875 --> 06:38.703
- I'm gonna set you up back here.
- Wait, Morris, what's the deal, man?

06:38.718 --> 06:41.062
- What's going on?
- Well...

06:41.276 --> 06:44.403
- tonight is the night.
- What are you talking about?

06:44.547 --> 06:48.033
- Abby and Luka, they're getting married.
- You were right!

06:48.056 --> 06:50.422
I told you: Abby and Luka are getting married.

06:50.437 --> 06:52.583
Seriously?
Doctor Kovac and Doctor Lockhart?

06:52.608 --> 06:55.123
- Yes siree.
- That is so dope.

06:55.276 --> 06:56.811
A surprise wedding.
How novel.

06:56.978 --> 06:59.333
That doesn't sound like Lockhart's style.
Does Abby even know?

06:59.366 --> 07:00.631
It's gonna be awesome! Isn't it?

07:00.658 --> 07:03.880
We're just running a tad bit behind.
We've hit an itty bitty snag.

07:03.907 --> 07:07.251
- Do you need help with anything?
- Small case of cold feet.

07:07.365 --> 07:11.761
It's a logistical issue. We will be sealing
the deal within the hour. Excuse me.

07:11.987 --> 07:14.573
- I know what you think.
- Oh, really? That this is a paternalistic,

07:14.606 --> 07:17.312
controlling manipulation that makes me
question our entire relationship?

07:17.336 --> 07:19.231
Maybe it's a symbol of
how much I love you,

07:19.275 --> 07:22.652
how well I know you, how deeply
we're meant to be together.

07:23.506 --> 07:24.940
Oh, jeez.

07:25.488 --> 07:29.603
- What kind of ring do you think I got?
- I... I-I have no idea what kind of...

07:29.648 --> 07:30.970
- It's not bad.
- Okay, the music.

07:31.006 --> 07:33.610
I don't want to ruin the surprise,
but there will be no Celine Dion,

07:33.635 --> 07:36.802
- no Air Supply, and no boy bands.
- Really, not even a little bit of Menudo?

07:36.827 --> 07:38.901
The food is international.
You name the country, we got it.

07:38.916 --> 07:41.151
Okay, so, what am I gonna wear-- this?
I'm supposed to wear this?

07:41.176 --> 07:42.772
You mentioned it one morning.

07:42.868 --> 07:46.342
I was half-asleep and you were
flipping through the magazine.

07:46.588 --> 07:49.922
You thought
I wasn't paying any attention.

07:55.878 --> 07:58.910
- That's not going to fit.
- Hope sized it off some of your other things.

07:58.976 --> 08:01.600
- Hope, Hope, Hope, Hope, Hope...
- Her cousin's a tailor.

08:01.648 --> 08:04.901
She's got him on standby
if it needs any adjustments.

08:14.288 --> 08:17.532
Croatian tentation
pulls a rabbit out of the hat.

08:19.665 --> 08:21.162
I just...

08:21.486 --> 08:24.620
wanted to make the wedding that
I thought is going to make you happy.

08:24.645 --> 08:28.552
- Luka...
- Oh, no, don't say no, not now--

08:28.575 --> 08:31.303
- not after everything.
- It's too weird.

08:32.125 --> 08:36.630
It's too sudden. You just want to just do
it on the spur of the moment like this?

08:39.226 --> 08:44.773
If there was ever anything
that was not rushed into,

08:45.425 --> 08:48.541
it's you and me promising
to be together forever.

08:56.545 --> 09:01.191
You know, Ray, thank you, weddings are
great opportunities for guys like us.

09:01.205 --> 09:04.063
- Weakens a woman's defenses, you know?
- Sure.

09:04.785 --> 09:08.900
- You ever think about settling down?
- Sometimes, I guess.

09:09.058 --> 09:11.352
- You?
- Me?

09:12.286 --> 09:13.572
No. Never.

09:13.755 --> 09:16.032
- If I did, I would never admit it.
- All right.

09:20.087 --> 09:21.681
Well, the bar's right there.

09:25.676 --> 09:28.320
Bartender... give my friend another.

09:28.374 --> 09:30.833
The energy is sagging, Archie,
you have to do something!

09:30.847 --> 09:32.273
Here, have a drink.

09:36.304 --> 09:40.142
Timing, momentum, flow-- they're,
they're crucial to an event like this...

09:40.159 --> 09:42.120
Hope, calm down.
Everybody's having a good time.

09:42.137 --> 09:46.492
It is sagging, damn it,
don't tell me to calm down!

09:46.745 --> 09:49.763
Thank you, okay, okay,
this is easy, this is easy.

09:49.777 --> 09:52.571
Excuse me. Do you have
a playlist that I can see?

10:15.575 --> 10:20.092
Look, it's sweet, it really is.
And I, I love that you did it. But...

10:20.118 --> 10:24.480
this should be something that we plan
together, something we both want.

10:24.518 --> 10:26.291
What else do you want?
I'll get it.

10:26.898 --> 10:28.210
Luka...

10:29.266 --> 10:32.812
We could put this off forever. There's
always gonna be some reason not to do it,

10:32.878 --> 10:37.312
but we want it, we deserve it-- so let's
stop stalling and dive in the ocean.

10:37.358 --> 10:38.710
'Jump into the pool.'

10:38.805 --> 10:41.803
- It's been seven years, Abby.
- I know how long it's been.

10:56.107 --> 10:59.031
- Let's just do this one thing.
- I never...

10:59.117 --> 11:02.541
It's fast and easy and right.

11:05.605 --> 11:09.550
Let's get married, right here,
right now. Tonight.

11:25.277 --> 11:29.071
What about Joe?
We can't get married without Joe.

11:29.245 --> 11:31.213
My secret weapon.

11:38.335 --> 11:40.320
Saved the best for last, huh?

11:50.488 --> 11:52.270
That's Pretty kooky, huh?

11:53.647 --> 11:55.743
Them getting married, like this.

11:57.007 --> 11:59.303
Yeah, it's pretty kooky.

11:59.906 --> 12:02.612
- How's it going down there?
- Oh, they're getting ready.

12:06.675 --> 12:07.771
What's this?

12:08.935 --> 12:10.482
It's for you.

12:12.248 --> 12:15.811
I started doing a little bit of
recording again, on my own.

12:16.035 --> 12:18.733
And it's got some songs
I've been working on.

12:19.255 --> 12:21.323
Really? That's great.

12:22.007 --> 12:24.832
There's one about you-- but
you'll have to figure it out--

12:25.216 --> 12:26.571
plus a few others I burned.

12:26.825 --> 12:29.562
You know, some songs we used
to listen to when we were roommates.

12:31.067 --> 12:34.122
- I'm sorry, Ray.
- About what?

12:35.375 --> 12:39.991
I thought I was coming alone, and he just
turned up. I didn't know what to do.

12:40.236 --> 12:42.901
No offense, but, um...

12:45.166 --> 12:47.842
not knowing what to do
has become your baseline.

12:49.386 --> 12:51.591
This isn't easy for me, Ray.

12:52.738 --> 12:55.862
I've had a pretty hard time,
ever since...

12:59.865 --> 13:03.161
losing Michael; I still haven't quite...

13:03.208 --> 13:05.862
- Yeah, I know.
- I mean, Tony was new.

13:06.186 --> 13:07.843
There was no history.

13:08.207 --> 13:11.173
He didn't make me think
about things from before.

13:12.985 --> 13:16.942
Maybe I rushed into it
because it made moving on easier.

13:21.908 --> 13:24.432
So I feel like history to you?

13:25.778 --> 13:29.003
I couldn't separate you from Michael.

13:29.885 --> 13:32.841
I couldn't be with you and not feel guilty.

13:36.176 --> 13:37.492
What about now?

13:38.776 --> 13:39.920
Now?

13:43.146 --> 13:45.693
I'm not sure all that matters anymore.

13:49.486 --> 13:50.832
Meaning...?

13:52.797 --> 13:54.653
Ah! There you guys are.

13:54.857 --> 13:58.633
Neela, Abby needs to see you
before the ceremony. Come on.

14:04.248 --> 14:06.393
- I got to go.
- Okay.

14:21.427 --> 14:23.810
- This is so nutty.
- Tell me about it.

14:23.835 --> 14:27.001
- It's great; everyone's so excited!
- Listen, I have to ask you a question.

14:27.177 --> 14:29.952
What do you need?
Something borrowed, something blue?

14:30.006 --> 14:32.653
I mean, Chuny has a scarf. It's kind of
aqua in color, but it might do the trick.

14:32.677 --> 14:35.340
Yeah, can you just sit down
for a second? Sit down.

14:42.005 --> 14:44.892
You know, first of all, I know this has
been a really rough year for you,

14:44.918 --> 14:48.220
and I don't think I have been
around as much as I should,

14:48.247 --> 14:51.583
- and I feel bad about that.
- Oh, you don't have to.

14:56.965 --> 14:59.472
But you've always been a great friend to me.

14:59.858 --> 15:01.030
So...

15:04.426 --> 15:05.872
So...

15:07.688 --> 15:09.403
I was wondering,
if you didn't mind too much,

15:09.436 --> 15:11.042
do you think you could lead the way

15:11.076 --> 15:13.672
and stand up there with me
when we do this?

15:15.605 --> 15:17.060
You mean, uh...

15:17.557 --> 15:19.243
like, be your maid of honor?

15:19.457 --> 15:25.032
Well, I hate to put that kind
of conventional term on it...

15:26.258 --> 15:27.553
but yes.

15:30.785 --> 15:32.490
I'd be honored.

15:34.375 --> 15:35.603
Thank you.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.972
Okay, well, your first job is figure out
how I put these in my hair.

15:41.088 --> 15:42.443
- Hair?
- Yeah.

15:42.535 --> 15:45.803
It's a Croatian thing. I don't know--
they belonged to Luka's mother.

15:55.917 --> 15:57.203
Okay.

15:58.206 --> 16:00.853
Okay, stop it. Don't start now.

16:02.256 --> 16:04.852
- Oh, God.
- I know.

16:10.178 --> 16:11.291
Come in.

16:15.798 --> 16:18.883
There he is.
Dead man walking.

16:19.395 --> 16:20.592
Very funny.

16:20.645 --> 16:23.171
What, what, you're not
getting cold feet, are you?

16:23.236 --> 16:25.061
'Cause you know, I could find
a back way out of here.

16:25.116 --> 16:28.023
I'll have you at a gentlemen's club
across town in under 20 minutes.

16:28.076 --> 16:29.140
Pratt.

16:29.896 --> 16:33.162
I'm just teasing you, man.
So, um...

16:33.398 --> 16:36.302
Hope said you wanted to talk to me,
said it was important.

16:37.456 --> 16:39.701
We've had our moments, Pratt.
And...

16:39.736 --> 16:44.903
I haven't always liked the things you've
done or the way you've done them, but...

16:45.117 --> 16:47.822
I've always respected your reasons.

16:48.768 --> 16:49.943
Thanks.

16:50.957 --> 16:56.700
I had to supervise you, which wasn't
always easy for either of us, but, uh...

16:56.776 --> 17:00.583
I think we've managed to reach a place
where, at the end of the day,

17:00.767 --> 17:02.812
we're also friends.

17:03.095 --> 17:05.390
Yeah, I feel the same way.

17:09.895 --> 17:11.820
Would you stand up for me?

17:16.047 --> 17:18.050
What, you mean like...?

17:18.855 --> 17:20.501
Be my best man.

17:23.847 --> 17:25.800
Anytime, anyplace.

17:33.146 --> 17:35.602
- Don't lose that.
- No, I won't.

17:35.678 --> 17:38.880
It's go time, my brother.
Are you ready? 'Cause it's go time.

17:39.248 --> 17:40.650
Let's do it.

17:43.528 --> 17:46.113
- Oh, your tie's crooked; let me fix that.
- I'm fine, Morris.

17:46.337 --> 17:47.862
- All right, there you go.
- Morris, Morris, leave me alone.

17:47.875 --> 17:50.080
- Okay, okay, sorry.
- Stop pointing that thing at me.

17:50.105 --> 17:52.670
- I'm emotional.
- Okay, everything's good,

17:52.778 --> 17:55.321
everything's under control,
there's just been one minor change.

17:55.736 --> 17:58.641
The justice of the peace couldn't
make it, so he sent a replacement.

17:58.676 --> 18:01.163
- Someone else is doing the ceremony?
- He's very experienced.

18:01.206 --> 18:04.771
- It will be lovely.
- Okay, go. Go, go, go.

18:04.837 --> 18:06.450
Go, go.

18:31.708 --> 18:32.953
Okay.

18:37.966 --> 18:39.300
- Ready? - No.
- She'll be fine.

18:39.316 --> 18:40.680
- Here, take this.
- I don't want that.

18:40.705 --> 18:42.092
Abby, do you want
to make Sophie cry again?

18:42.115 --> 18:44.242
Sophie, I'm sorry,
but I'm really not ready.

18:44.275 --> 18:47.311
- Why do you have to be such a whiner?
- Why do you have to be such a crybaby?

18:47.315 --> 18:49.942
Yeah, okay, Sophie.
Come on, honey.

20:23.138 --> 20:24.581
Welcome.

20:25.178 --> 20:28.060
I understand from my notes...

20:28.328 --> 20:31.370
- Luka and Abigail...
- Um, it's Abby.

20:31.475 --> 20:36.103
...have no patience for the normal rituals--
which I find a little meshuggeh,

20:36.176 --> 20:39.720
but, hey, if that's how you want it,
we'll get right to it.

20:41.365 --> 20:45.370
"Today, you become a man."
No, sorry.

20:45.415 --> 20:48.282
Bar Mitzvah this morning.
Kid was such a schnook.

20:48.356 --> 20:54.231
Here. "Marriage is an important step,
a great responsibility,"

20:55.676 --> 21:01.093
"coming together of souls..."
Yada-yada, yada-yada.

21:01.668 --> 21:05.141
- Any readings?
- Uh, no, no.

21:05.625 --> 21:09.462
No readings? Oh, come on,
readings are a nice touch, classy.

21:09.505 --> 21:11.380
- I've got one.
- You do?

21:11.577 --> 21:14.112
Yeah, it's a Punjabi tradition.

21:27.955 --> 21:30.790
That's beautiful.
What is it?

21:31.557 --> 21:37.520
It's about love, faith and devotion.
It's kind of a blessing.

21:39.685 --> 21:40.791
All righty.

21:41.257 --> 21:45.132
Next thing:
any jilted ex-lovers out there

21:45.176 --> 21:47.433
want to say something about
why these two shouldn't be married?

21:47.478 --> 21:50.452
- Okay, moving on.
- Okay. Vows.

21:50.578 --> 21:51.522
No vows.

21:51.605 --> 21:54.841
Can you just skip ahead to
the "I now pronounce you" thing?

21:54.988 --> 21:56.352
No vows?

21:57.485 --> 21:58.922
You have vows?

22:07.966 --> 22:09.701
Be my wife.

22:10.518 --> 22:15.161
I offer myself,
with all my faults and strengths.

22:16.567 --> 22:18.843
We'll help each other when we need help

22:19.316 --> 22:21.900
and work together to raise our son.

22:23.977 --> 22:29.533
I choose you as the person I will love
and honor for the rest of my days.

22:34.298 --> 22:35.590
Abigail.

22:37.518 --> 22:41.073
Well, it's not really fair,
because you got to practice.

22:41.518 --> 22:43.431
Yeah, it's not fair
because he had time to practice.

22:43.485 --> 22:44.961
- Abigail.
- It's Abby.

22:49.227 --> 22:52.363
Um, well, okay.

22:53.107 --> 22:55.050
Uh, okay, um...

22:58.015 --> 22:59.601
First of all...

23:00.397 --> 23:02.330
First of all, I love you.

23:03.968 --> 23:05.401
I do.

23:06.936 --> 23:10.552
And you've helped me through a lot.

23:11.876 --> 23:17.230
And we got here together
with a beautiful little boy.

23:21.998 --> 23:26.281
And, uh, I-I was thinking of a poem...
a poem for, actually, um,

23:26.518 --> 23:31.061
before when I was getting ready,
and I think... I think it starts...

23:34.038 --> 23:37.722
"I carry your heart in my heart.

23:38.988 --> 23:40.972
"I am never without it.

23:43.405 --> 23:46.380
Anywhere I go, you go."

23:49.496 --> 23:53.501
I'm probably messing the whole
thing up, but I think, uh...

23:54.358 --> 23:57.100
I think the end goes...

23:58.765 --> 24:02.420
"And this is the wonder
that keeps the stars apart.

24:03.578 --> 24:05.473
"I carry your heart.

24:06.317 --> 24:08.500
I carry it in my heart."

24:13.505 --> 24:18.970
So, I guess what I'm saying is, let's
just try to love each other, and...

24:20.816 --> 24:22.471
persevere.

24:32.397 --> 24:33.632
Jeez.

24:34.618 --> 24:36.710
For two people who want
to cut to the chase,

24:37.287 --> 24:38.940
you sure know how to go on.

24:41.617 --> 24:42.780
Rings?

25:12.908 --> 25:14.302
Humor me.

25:16.717 --> 25:20.933
By the power vested in me by
Cook County and the State of Illinois,

25:21.235 --> 25:24.530
I hereby pronounce you husband and wife.

25:24.946 --> 25:27.112
Step on the glass and kiss that girl.

25:30.007 --> 25:31.341
Mazel tov!

25:48.875 --> 25:51.761
Attention. Attention, please.
Quiet! Shut up!

25:51.878 --> 25:56.990
Uh, I have been asked to kick off the
party portion of tonight's festivities.

25:57.978 --> 25:59.160
Thank you, thank you.

25:59.307 --> 26:02.030
Uh, and, you know, I'd just
like to say that this is, uh...

26:02.115 --> 26:05.280
This is clearly a marriage
made at County.

26:05.467 --> 26:08.070
Yes. 'Cause if we worked
at Northwestern or Rush,

26:08.108 --> 26:10.371
there'd be better food
and a lot more booze.

26:11.237 --> 26:14.691
The top shelf stuff, right, Lucien?
Relax, big guy.

26:16.178 --> 26:19.280
Hey, you know, I'm not...
I'm not saying that-that Kovac is cheap,

26:19.396 --> 26:23.450
but he did try to get Murray
the Roach Coach guy to cater this thing.

26:25.495 --> 26:29.383
Anyway, the kids have rested up
and are ready for their first dance,

26:29.417 --> 26:35.120
so I give you Abby Lockhart,
Luka Kovac, married couple.

27:20.236 --> 27:23.751
It was so beautiful what you said.
It really...

27:23.948 --> 27:29.490
- added an ethnic spice to the ceremony.
- I was just trying to do my part.

27:30.257 --> 27:31.663
What did it mean?

27:34.558 --> 27:38.802
- I wasn't really prepared.
- Oh, don't be so modest.  You were great!

27:40.846 --> 27:43.331
Well, it meant, um...

27:45.168 --> 27:48.340
"I went to the market
to buy some meat, but the...

27:49.806 --> 27:54.691
butcher wasn't there,
so I got fish instead."

27:56.075 --> 27:58.672
It was the only Punjabi
I could come up with in a pinch.

27:59.745 --> 28:00.930
Okay.

28:01.908 --> 28:04.573
Let's just keep that between ourselves.

28:22.738 --> 28:27.313
- Stevie Wonder, huh?
- I told you-- I hear everything you say.

28:29.706 --> 28:31.002
I-I know, sweetheart.
You know what?

28:31.065 --> 28:32.861
Just try to go to sleep,
and if you need me,

28:32.875 --> 28:35.273
or you just want to talk to me,
you call me, okay?

28:35.417 --> 28:39.172
It doesn't matter what time-- just
call me, and I'll be here, all right?

28:39.528 --> 28:40.641
Okay.

28:41.477 --> 28:43.983
I love you, too.
Bye.

28:44.537 --> 28:46.252
Missing the first dance.

28:49.197 --> 28:51.731
Sarah called.
She's having a rough night.

28:53.505 --> 28:54.653
She all right?

28:55.537 --> 28:57.090
She's a tough kid.

28:57.447 --> 28:58.493
Mostly.

28:59.505 --> 29:01.583
Sometimes, she's just a kid.

29:02.138 --> 29:05.212
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

29:05.417 --> 29:08.712
I'm happy for them. This is good.
This is... a beautiful night.

29:09.445 --> 29:10.580
I'm fine.

29:11.315 --> 29:12.503
Tony.

29:13.545 --> 29:16.043
I just... I just don't get it sometimes.
You know, I don't...

29:16.306 --> 29:17.693
Why did she do this?

29:17.935 --> 29:21.123
I mean, I think, you know,
I'm handling it fine most of the time,

29:21.155 --> 29:23.330
but then other times,
I get so damn angry at her.

29:23.545 --> 29:26.310
I mean, how could she leave
a beautiful kid like this?

29:26.345 --> 29:28.690
How could she... How could she mess
with our minds like this?

29:28.716 --> 29:30.490
- How could she lie to us?
- It's okay.

29:30.518 --> 29:34.631
- It's not okay, it's not okay!
- It's okay to be angry.

29:34.828 --> 29:37.142
It is? She's dead.

29:37.965 --> 29:39.683
I'm angry at Michael.

29:40.297 --> 29:42.732
Still. I'm not sure I'll ever get over it.

29:47.445 --> 29:48.440
I...

29:51.028 --> 29:52.782
I haven't been a good friend.

29:53.055 --> 29:54.512
I know that.

29:55.947 --> 29:57.590
I screwed up, and...

30:00.016 --> 30:02.503
...I want to make it right,
I want to make it better.

30:07.236 --> 30:08.583
Can I have another chance?

30:11.055 --> 30:12.063
Tony...

30:15.585 --> 30:18.542
...I don't think this is the time
or the place for this.

30:19.486 --> 30:22.640
- It seems perfect to me.
- I, uh...

30:25.587 --> 30:27.330
Maybe we should talk about
this another time.

30:27.358 --> 30:30.251
Uh, maybe we can go for coffee
or something this weekend.

30:30.428 --> 30:33.922
Coffee ?
People get back together over dinner.

30:34.228 --> 30:36.103
They break up over coffee.

30:36.646 --> 30:40.722
I just... need to get back inside.

30:50.107 --> 30:52.360
All right, all right, all right.
Please just give me a few minutes.

30:52.375 --> 30:54.073
I know you're having a good time.
You were lovely.

30:54.178 --> 30:56.291
Pardon me, twinkle toes.
You did a great job out there.

30:56.318 --> 30:58.761
All right. Just give me a few seconds,
a few seconds.

30:58.827 --> 31:01.291
Listen, first and foremost,
I have to, uh,

31:01.336 --> 31:03.580
thank Luka for inviting us
all here today.

31:03.607 --> 31:05.701
It's not like we had a choice.

31:05.958 --> 31:08.400
And I think I speak for everyone,
including Frank,

31:08.437 --> 31:12.741
when I say that it is an honor and a
privilege to be here on your special day.

31:12.925 --> 31:14.752
Hear! Hear!

31:14.915 --> 31:18.011
Now, I mean, you guys know me--
I've never been married before, so...

31:18.056 --> 31:20.113
But he's dated women who were.

31:21.195 --> 31:23.251
Leave your mom out of it, Morris.

31:25.076 --> 31:28.361
Okay, okay, what's the difference
between an ER nurse and a Porsche, Sam?

31:28.476 --> 31:31.793
Okay, okay, whoa, whoa, whoa,
all right, listen, listen.

31:31.805 --> 31:34.231
I can't believe you guys
save lives for a living.

31:34.747 --> 31:39.443
No, but really, I've had the great pleasure
of working with Abby and Luka,

31:39.476 --> 31:41.591
both of whom I consider friends.

31:41.675 --> 31:46.310
And I see them working together,
sharing a life, sharing a family.

31:46.768 --> 31:48.773
You know, tonight's been a great night.

31:48.788 --> 31:52.271
And I know, we all know,
that this can't last forever, but...

31:52.397 --> 31:55.520
I think that we all do agree that
the love between you two will.

31:55.548 --> 31:59.193
And I know it will.
And hopefully, with some luck,

31:59.218 --> 32:02.622
maybe some of that love will
rub off on all of us here, and

32:02.645 --> 32:05.441
help us find someone
as special as you two have.

32:05.705 --> 32:11.912
Someone to spend the rest of your
lives with, as friends and as lovers.

32:14.388 --> 32:15.952
To Abby and Luka.

32:16.125 --> 32:18.940
And love and friendship.
Hear! Hear!

32:20.308 --> 32:22.382
D.J., you know what to do.
Come on, now.

32:22.985 --> 32:25.300
Oh, here we go.
Marquez?

32:42.056 --> 32:45.373
- Hey, baby.
- Who are you talking to?

32:45.647 --> 32:47.531
The hottest nurse in the ER.

32:54.457 --> 32:58.343
Don't take a plate away without making
sure that the guest is finished eating,

32:58.368 --> 33:01.790
and make sure that there are no empties,
and-and don't forget to crumb the tables.

33:01.975 --> 33:04.473
And you, button your vest up, please!

33:05.075 --> 33:07.073
- Hope.
- What are you doing here?

33:07.117 --> 33:08.602
No, you should be out there.

33:08.637 --> 33:11.213
No, the bride cannot be back
here with the hoi-polloi.

33:15.905 --> 33:18.141
I want to thank you for all of this.

33:19.796 --> 33:21.421
- You do?
- Yes.

33:24.976 --> 33:28.670
- You're not going to... hurt me?
- No.

33:34.625 --> 33:35.831
What's wrong?

33:37.278 --> 33:40.013
You just look so beautiful.

33:48.507 --> 33:49.843
Luka.

33:50.746 --> 33:52.252
Hey, you seen Abby?

33:52.416 --> 33:54.971
Congratulations, Luka,
you're a lucky guy.

33:55.317 --> 33:57.430
- No, really, Abby's great.
- I know.

33:57.476 --> 33:59.723
- Don't ever hurt her.
- Excuse me?

33:59.938 --> 34:01.852
- I mean it.
- Okay.

34:10.106 --> 34:11.199
Chuny.

34:11.956 --> 34:14.850
Anybody ever told you you was
the hottest nurse in the ER?

34:14.878 --> 34:15.952
Yeah.

34:18.475 --> 34:21.003
No, no, no, seriously, I'm sorry,
you're great. You'd never hurt her.

34:21.038 --> 34:23.431
I know that.
What was I thinking?

34:23.536 --> 34:28.291
But if you did, I would hunt
you down like a cheetah.

34:38.647 --> 34:44.362
- Lucien, having fun?
- Yeah, it's fun, it's a lot of fun.

34:45.367 --> 34:47.701
I went to a surgery wedding once.
It was such a bore.

34:47.775 --> 34:50.463
All they did was talk, talk, talk.

34:50.797 --> 34:54.933
ER weddings have... you know, spunk.

34:54.966 --> 34:57.720
Yeah, um, you know, they're serving
coffee right now if you...

34:57.808 --> 34:59.122
What about you? You having fun?

34:59.178 --> 35:02.131
- Yeah.
- It is fun, isn't it? It's just a lot of...

35:08.315 --> 35:09.452
Fun.

35:10.458 --> 35:13.663
Uh, I have to go to the bathroom.

35:16.758 --> 35:19.101
Um, I'm looking for...

35:20.685 --> 35:23.093
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

35:30.475 --> 35:32.452
Has everyone gone bonkers?

35:44.227 --> 35:47.710
- You all right?
- I always cry at weddings.

35:49.265 --> 35:50.792
I'm alone.

35:52.108 --> 35:55.461
Oh, well, um, that's all right.

35:58.475 --> 36:04.062
I just want to say I appreciate
all the mentoring you've done.

36:04.305 --> 36:07.012
Have I... done that?

36:07.526 --> 36:11.913
And I totally admire you a lot.

36:13.705 --> 36:15.040
And...

36:22.498 --> 36:29.103
I just really wanted you to know that.
Really, really know it.

36:38.237 --> 36:41.801
Yo, there's some freaky stuff
going on in here, man.

36:41.828 --> 36:43.952
Yeah, probably something in the water.

36:44.018 --> 36:46.372
Timmy told me I was
the hottest nurse in the ER.

36:47.696 --> 36:50.011
What do you want from me,
a second opinion?

36:58.668 --> 37:03.230
Hi. I'd like a, uh, dry dirty martini
and a tequila sunrise, please.

37:04.395 --> 37:05.930
Hey, Ray, what's shakin'?

37:06.665 --> 37:08.503
Dry and dirty?

37:08.675 --> 37:10.690
I should have figured that one out.

37:11.508 --> 37:17.691
Actually, I, uh, I prefer the tequila
sunrise because of all the pretty colors.

37:18.676 --> 37:19.750
Asshole.

37:19.955 --> 37:23.090
Gates, what are you doing, man? Save
some liquor for everybody else, all right?

37:23.118 --> 37:25.342
Bartender, another one, please,
vodka and cranberry.

37:25.377 --> 37:27.430
Hey, Ray, I don't know if you noticed,
but there's a party going on here.

37:27.468 --> 37:29.763
Everybody's having a good time, dancing,
so any time you feel like, you know,

37:29.776 --> 37:32.512
jumping in, you know, just get
off your little stool and, uh...

37:32.535 --> 37:37.041
Bartender, uh, hot coffee for him.
Keep it coming, fast and black, won't you?

37:37.605 --> 37:39.312
You're a real prick, you know that?

37:41.985 --> 37:44.172
- Problem?
- Not yet, but soon.

37:50.896 --> 37:55.133
What's, uh, what's your damage, Ray?

37:58.236 --> 38:03.052
My damage is you walked into our ER
like you owned the place.

38:04.266 --> 38:05.952
I don't appreciate that.

38:06.815 --> 38:08.260
Nobody else does.

38:09.926 --> 38:12.483
Ray, I realize that you don't like me,

38:13.227 --> 38:16.370
but sooner or later, you're going to
have to get used to living with me...

38:17.356 --> 38:19.653
'cause I ain't going nowhere.

38:20.067 --> 38:22.630
You want to leave a mess wherever
you go, that's up to you.

38:24.216 --> 38:27.733
But there are two things
I will not let you screw around with.

38:27.748 --> 38:30.110
That is patients' lives and...

38:30.546 --> 38:33.892
- And what, Ray?
- And her.

38:34.147 --> 38:36.942
Hey, I care about her,
you sulky little pissant.

38:36.977 --> 38:38.613
I bet you almost have yourself
convinced about that.

38:38.635 --> 38:41.832
But the problem is you're
the only one that buys it.

38:41.856 --> 38:45.320
- Come on, Ray, let's go for a walk.
- W-Wait, l-l-let me just say, Ray, Ray.

38:45.528 --> 38:47.113
You know that thing you guys
had in the past?

38:47.305 --> 38:49.321
- It's over, finished, done.
- Tony.

38:51.278 --> 38:54.481
- You don't know how to take care of her.
- Ray, please.

38:57.628 --> 39:02.872
- Well, Ray, at least I'm trying, huh?
- That's right, that's right.

39:02.968 --> 39:06.331
- Like you took care of Meg, huh?
- Okay. Hey, hey, let it...

39:06.337 --> 39:09.332
- Come on, man. You've had enough.
- Let it go, he's drunk. That's it, it's fine.

39:15.776 --> 39:16.822
Stop it!

39:22.927 --> 39:24.171
All right, let's go.

39:35.196 --> 39:37.920
Hey, come on.
What's wrong with you?

39:37.976 --> 39:39.222
Okay, I'm good, get off me.

39:39.248 --> 39:41.123
What are you trying to do?
You trying to ruin it for Abby and Luka?

39:41.148 --> 39:42.940
Just get the hell off of me, man!

39:43.176 --> 39:45.130
Hey, Ray, what's going on with you, man?

39:45.788 --> 39:48.060
I think you get it, Greg.
You know?

39:50.986 --> 39:53.352
Every time I think I'm turning a corner

39:53.537 --> 39:56.553
and I feel like I know what I'm doing,
I end up falling backwards again.

39:56.575 --> 40:00.151
Look, it's a wedding, you're drunk,
and you're hooked on a girl.

40:00.445 --> 40:02.742
Just go home. You'll feel better
about it in the morning.

40:02.778 --> 40:06.340
- I don't want to go home.
- Well, you're done here, okay?

40:06.436 --> 40:08.940
- So just catch a cab.
- Pratt.

40:09.555 --> 40:10.870
Go home, Ray.

40:11.478 --> 40:13.022
I'm not kidding.
Go home.

40:15.818 --> 40:17.480
You know what I love about you, Gates?

40:17.787 --> 40:20.871
Just when I get worried that
maybe I'm being a little tough on you,

40:20.907 --> 40:22.853
you do something to prove
what an ass you are.

40:22.878 --> 40:26.623
Me? I was being perfectly civil until
that alcoholic O.C. reject went off on me.

40:26.645 --> 40:28.051
You should have kept walking.

40:28.108 --> 40:30.773
Morris, as my role model
Kenny Rogers once said,

40:30.808 --> 40:32.391
sometimes you have to fight
when you're a man.

40:32.407 --> 40:35.233
Oh... that's deep, that's... Gates.

40:35.276 --> 40:38.091
Don't worry, I'm not going back in.
I just want to talk to her.

40:40.215 --> 40:42.551
- Neela.
- Not right now, Tony.

40:42.686 --> 40:45.623
- Can't you see she's upset?
- Chuny, I just want to talk to her, okay?

40:47.546 --> 40:50.680
Uh, it's all right, I'm fine, Chuny.
Thank you so much.

40:56.188 --> 40:57.791
I'm sorry that happened.

40:58.815 --> 41:00.622
You know, Abby and Luka were
in the other room, thank God.

41:00.648 --> 41:02.422
- They don't even know about it.
- There's no excuse.

41:02.435 --> 41:05.393
- No, Tony, there isn't.
- I wasn't looking for trouble. The guy...

41:05.466 --> 41:07.872
- he just wouldn't back down.
- Oh, right, and there was no other way

41:07.907 --> 41:10.232
for that conversation to end
without him backing down.

41:10.246 --> 41:11.392
What do you mean?

41:12.518 --> 41:17.213
Well... with men, you have to win,
and with women... well

41:17.245 --> 41:20.893
with women, you have to feel like
you've done right by them,

41:21.155 --> 41:25.272
even if all you're doing is causing them
pain or, at best, wasting their time.

41:25.306 --> 41:28.120
Is that what you think I'm doing,
wasting your time?

41:31.247 --> 41:32.901
You know, I think...

41:33.806 --> 41:36.530
we both got into this because
we knew it had no future.

41:36.578 --> 41:39.172
It was just a bridge from one part of our life into another.

41:39.185 --> 41:42.501
- I think it's a lot more than that.
- I don't love you.

41:46.267 --> 41:48.753
And I don't think you love me
and I don't see

41:48.778 --> 41:51.610
much chance of that changing
any time soon.

41:57.837 --> 41:59.421
So that's it?

42:00.056 --> 42:01.522
We're done?

42:04.056 --> 42:04.943
Yeah.

42:06.497 --> 42:09.221
- Because Ray couldn't get over you?
- No.

42:11.087 --> 42:16.721
Because... you can stand there as
if you're listening to what I'm saying

42:16.777 --> 42:19.853
and still believe that none
of this is your fault.

42:47.106 --> 42:49.072
Got any bourbon?

42:57.556 --> 42:59.193
Can you make it a double?

43:03.057 --> 43:05.711
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I just...

43:06.476 --> 43:08.463
wish that hadn't happened though.

43:09.408 --> 43:11.300
- You did a really good job tonight.
- No, no, no, no.

43:11.335 --> 43:13.983
You did an awesome job.

43:16.737 --> 43:19.480
Aw, they look so happy.

43:19.686 --> 43:22.861
I got them the honeymoon suite
at the Ritz for a few nights,

43:23.137 --> 43:25.812
but they say they can't use it
on account of Joe and everything.

43:25.847 --> 43:27.792
Yeah, I can see that.

43:28.816 --> 43:29.981
It's too bad.

43:30.358 --> 43:32.380
I... really don't want
the room to go to waste.

43:32.556 --> 43:34.082
Yeah.

43:34.655 --> 43:36.532
I don't either.

43:37.566 --> 43:41.193
- Really, y-you don't?
- No, of course not.

43:43.166 --> 43:45.710
Are you suggesting
what I think you're suggesting?

43:46.125 --> 43:49.233
- Oh, it's go time.
- It's...

43:50.185 --> 43:53.323
C-Can I get that on record, please?
Say, say that again.

43:56.847 --> 43:59.403
So you quit your job and
get married in the same week?

43:59.578 --> 44:01.752
- I'm a new guy now.
- Is that so?

44:02.657 --> 44:06.933
Being chief was going just me spending
less time with my wife and baby.

44:14.085 --> 44:17.343
Well, I have to admit I don't think
I could have planned a better wedding.

44:17.547 --> 44:19.913
- You don't?
- I don't.

44:28.616 --> 44:32.430
Uh... Abby, it was a really nice wedding.

44:34.755 --> 44:38.493
Luka, what I said before
about hurting Abby...

44:39.018 --> 44:40.541
I meant it.

44:44.055 --> 44:48.683
I'm not really sure why I'm here,
but I'm very happy to be invited.

44:50.656 --> 44:55.180
- I don't really know these people.
- Okay, let me just put this down.

44:55.678 --> 44:59.222
- Oh, there's Morris with the thing.
- Yep.

45:00.318 --> 45:02.673
- Come over here, Morris.
- Shh-shh-shh, here we go, here we go.

45:02.706 --> 45:07.330
Hey, we just want to say, uh,
congrats to our fearless leader here.

45:07.375 --> 45:10.742
Yes, yeah, a-and we wish him a life of,
of contentment and joy.

45:10.787 --> 45:13.653
- And love.
- Yes, yes, uh, what else?

45:14.215 --> 45:17.283
Oh, oh, uh, sleeping with only one woman.

45:17.315 --> 45:18.533
- Ever again.
- Forever.

45:18.568 --> 45:19.912
Without end.

45:21.735 --> 45:26.403
Everybody's real nice. I hope
they'll be real happy together. I do.

45:26.626 --> 45:28.260
Even the bride.

46:57.075 --> 47:00.103
Uh, Ray.
Can you call me when you get this?

47:00.236 --> 47:04.660
Uh, I thought maybe we could go out
for breakfast or coffee or something.

47:04.875 --> 47:08.571
Uh, listen, I'm sorry about tonight.

47:53.717 --> 47:55.582
It's a pretty amazing night.

47:55.747 --> 47:59.090
Uh, I guess it just makes
you look forward to a time

47:59.116 --> 48:02.902
when you get to be as happy as
Abby and Luka are right now, so...

48:02.948 --> 48:04.691
Good, good job.
Okay, Ray, we got to go.

48:04.778 --> 48:07.572
Hey, dude, dude, can you,
uh, can you get this for us?

48:33.038 --> 48:38.330
