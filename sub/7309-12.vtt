WEBVTT

00:25.730 --> 00:28.930
Oh, crap.

00:41.700 --> 00:44.530
You gotta be kidding me.

00:50.630 --> 00:51.630
Hello?

00:51.750 --> 00:53.015
I'm from next door.

00:53.039 --> 00:54.314
I locked myself out.

00:54.460 --> 00:57.245
Uh, I just need you
to call the front desk.

00:58.269 --> 01:01.340
Hello?

01:04.104 --> 01:07.101
Holy Mother of God.

01:57.168 --> 01:58.938
Ziva, I'm not secretive.

01:58.998 --> 02:00.144
Did you hear that, Tony?

02:00.168 --> 02:01.774
McGee just said he's not secretive.

02:01.798 --> 02:03.014
Hmm, let's see: Wrote a novel.

02:03.038 --> 02:04.414
- Didn't tell us.
- Got it published.

02:04.438 --> 02:06.214
- Didn't tell us.
- Made substantial amounts of money

02:06.238 --> 02:07.744
- from said novel.
- Hmm, didn't tell us.

02:07.768 --> 02:09.214
- Anything else?
- Bought a Porsche.

02:09.238 --> 02:11.214
Didn't tell us. Can you see
how people might begin to think

02:11.238 --> 02:13.074
there was a pattern of
secretive behavior emerging here,

02:13.098 --> 02:14.114
Probie? Okay, look.

02:14.138 --> 02:15.344
I might have been hiding stuff.

02:15.368 --> 02:16.974
But it was not secretive, it was just...

02:16.998 --> 02:18.144
- Deceptive?
- Sneaky?

02:18.168 --> 02:19.868
Self-preservation.

02:19.938 --> 02:20.914
If I'd told you guys
I was writing a novel,

02:20.938 --> 02:22.144
you would have laughed at me.

02:22.168 --> 02:24.098
- True.
- True.

02:24.168 --> 02:25.214
Besides, everyone has secrets.

02:25.238 --> 02:26.644
I bet you two have some doozies.

02:26.668 --> 02:28.398
No.

02:29.968 --> 02:32.138
Ha?! What 'ha'? I said 'no.'

02:32.198 --> 02:33.344
You said no too quickly.

02:33.368 --> 02:34.274
He did, didn't he?

02:34.298 --> 02:35.398
What dark,

02:35.468 --> 02:36.944
dirty little secrets do you have

02:36.968 --> 02:39.573
that are making you so uncomfortable?

02:40.268 --> 02:43.116
Does she have a name?

02:43.190 --> 02:44.656
Lieutenant Brana SHAHEEN.

02:44.680 --> 02:47.606
Her death is really a
lost for the Marines.

02:47.630 --> 02:48.414
Marine Corps Intelligence?

02:48.438 --> 02:50.168
Three years.

02:50.238 --> 02:51.614
I've personally known her for two.

02:51.638 --> 02:52.844
She's an interpreter.

02:52.868 --> 02:54.974
Born in Kuwait, emigrated
when she was a kid.

02:54.998 --> 02:56.838
Working anything sensitive?

02:56.898 --> 03:00.414
Just routine, nothing classified
since we got back from Iraq.

03:00.438 --> 03:01.946
Ironic, isn't it?

03:02.014 --> 03:03.231
You last saw her Friday.

03:03.255 --> 03:05.644
She said she was going to
the country for the weekend.

03:05.668 --> 03:06.494
Didn't say where.

03:06.518 --> 03:09.112
I've got the impression
she was gonna meet someone.

03:09.136 --> 03:11.098
Edenvale.

03:13.638 --> 03:15.444
Where the hell is Edenvale?

03:15.468 --> 03:16.644
Keep scrolling, probie.

03:16.668 --> 03:18.074
I'm scrolling, I'm telling you,

03:18.098 --> 03:19.344
I can't find it.

03:19.368 --> 03:20.614
It's not on the map.

03:20.638 --> 03:21.698
Boondocks.

03:21.768 --> 03:23.598
Boondocks, boss.

03:23.668 --> 03:24.814
Pack a toothbrush.

03:24.838 --> 03:26.198
What are boondocks?

03:54.298 --> 03:56.014
Don't get a lot of murders out here

03:56.038 --> 03:57.314
in Edenvale, Agent Gibbs.

03:57.338 --> 03:58.444
Got the whole town talking.

03:58.468 --> 04:00.138
Well,

04:00.198 --> 04:01.374
you all wanna come on inside,

04:01.398 --> 04:02.774
I've set up the conference room for you.

04:02.798 --> 04:04.474
Crime scene first, Sheriff.

04:04.498 --> 04:07.114
Uh, that'd be the Edenvale, uh,

04:07.138 --> 04:08.714
Motel U. S. 29. A ten-minute drive.

04:08.738 --> 04:11.218
Not much to see out there, though.

04:11.868 --> 04:14.338
Except the crime scene.

04:14.398 --> 04:16.798
Well, yeah, room eight.

04:16.868 --> 04:18.574
Shot twice in the chest.

04:18.598 --> 04:20.538
Bled out under the door.

04:20.598 --> 04:23.514
Sheriff, the sooner we
get to work on the body,

04:23.538 --> 04:25.674
the sooner we'll be out of your way.

04:25.698 --> 04:27.738
You wanna work on the body?

04:29.068 --> 04:30.673
Preliminary examination.

04:30.698 --> 04:33.368
I'll do the autopsy back at D. C.

04:35.398 --> 04:38.244
Agent Gibbs, uh, I think
we have what you might call

04:38.268 --> 04:40.498
a breakdown in communications.

04:42.368 --> 04:44.498
She was found three days ago.

04:44.568 --> 04:46.514
Booked in under a false name.

04:46.538 --> 04:47.638
Paid cash.

04:47.698 --> 04:49.514
No pocketbook, no driver's license.

04:49.538 --> 04:50.538
No vehicle.

04:50.598 --> 04:52.444
Took the best part of two days

04:52.468 --> 04:54.344
to get her prints up to
Washington and processed.

04:54.368 --> 04:55.374
Soon as we found out

04:55.398 --> 04:56.414
she was a Marine, we called you.

04:56.438 --> 04:58.538
By that time,

04:58.598 --> 05:00.044
Harry had done the autopsy.

05:00.068 --> 05:01.844
Harry Lawson, the coroner.

05:01.868 --> 05:03.074
He's a good man.

05:03.098 --> 05:04.743
Well, I'll bet he is.

05:04.798 --> 05:09.178
He's also the funeral director
and owns the furniture store.

05:09.638 --> 05:11.498
Old country tradition.

05:13.438 --> 05:14.944
What about the crime scene, Sheriff?

05:14.968 --> 05:16.774
Uh, turned back to the motel.

05:16.798 --> 05:17.898
Cleaned up?

05:17.968 --> 05:19.474
And I'm guessing already occupied.

05:19.498 --> 05:20.568
Evidence?

05:20.638 --> 05:22.414
Oh, yeah, got plenty of that.

05:22.438 --> 05:24.644
Uh, you'll wanna talk to Ruby.

05:24.668 --> 05:27.074
If it was loose, I bagged it.

05:27.098 --> 05:29.598
Hairs, fibers, shell casing,

05:29.668 --> 05:31.444
gum wrappers, used tissues,

05:31.468 --> 05:35.644
uh, even an old French fry the
cleaning lady must have missed.

05:35.668 --> 05:37.274
It was right up under the headboard.

05:37.298 --> 05:39.668
Anybody would have missed it.

05:39.738 --> 05:42.314
Um, everything's been
tagged, numbered, indexed

05:42.338 --> 05:43.474
and photographed.

05:43.498 --> 05:45.344
I did the indexing by hand

05:45.368 --> 05:47.214
on account of the printer not working.

05:47.238 --> 05:48.438
Blood samples?

05:48.498 --> 05:50.344
I took multiples, sent some

05:50.368 --> 05:53.023
ho the lab, kept the rest as backup.

05:54.568 --> 05:56.268
Sorry... my fault.

05:56.338 --> 05:58.614
No, it, it does that all the time.

05:58.638 --> 05:59.914
Well, that's everything.

05:59.938 --> 06:02.268
Um, except

06:02.338 --> 06:04.368
one teeny-tiny little thing.

06:04.438 --> 06:05.938
She was shot twice.

06:05.998 --> 06:08.833
But I could only find one shell casing.

06:09.438 --> 06:10.614
Maybe he picked it up.

06:10.638 --> 06:11.339
Yeah, maybe.

06:11.363 --> 06:14.313
You said you had an office we could use?

06:21.968 --> 06:23.998
Here you go.

06:26.638 --> 06:29.298
Home sweet home.

06:29.368 --> 06:31.114
I'll stir up some coffee for you.

06:31.138 --> 06:33.318
Oh, uh, we do have a suspect.

06:35.104 --> 06:36.374
When were you gonna tell me that?

06:36.398 --> 06:38.014
Well, I'm telling you now.

06:38.038 --> 06:39.998
Tyler. Yeah?

06:40.068 --> 06:41.368
Bring me that

06:41.438 --> 06:43.074
suspect's file, would you?

06:43.098 --> 06:44.144
Yeah, the victim made one

06:44.168 --> 06:45.474
phone call from the motel.

06:45.498 --> 06:47.914
Local guy by the name of Masoud Tariq.

06:47.938 --> 06:48.998
Only been

06:49.068 --> 06:50.274
in town a few months.

06:50.298 --> 06:51.314
He's an Iraqi.

06:51.338 --> 06:52.514
Same as the victim.

06:52.538 --> 06:53.714
She's from Kuwait, actually.

06:53.738 --> 06:56.798
And where are you from?

06:56.868 --> 06:58.168
The city.

06:58.238 --> 07:00.838
Well, unfortunately, this guy

07:00.898 --> 07:02.814
Masoud Tariq, he's disappeared.

07:02.838 --> 07:04.074
So I got a search warrant.

07:04.098 --> 07:06.474
We found her lipstick
in his living room.

07:06.498 --> 07:08.698
Ruby got a fingerprint match.

07:08.768 --> 07:10.774
We've got a BOLO out for him,

07:10.798 --> 07:12.344
but he's got a couple days start.

07:12.368 --> 07:14.214
Now, he comes back, we'll catch him.

07:14.238 --> 07:17.078
You need anything else, you just holler.

07:21.538 --> 07:23.314
Did you see their name plates?

07:23.338 --> 07:24.468
Both Barretts.

07:24.538 --> 07:25.538
Brothers?

07:25.568 --> 07:26.568
Cousins?

07:26.638 --> 07:27.638
Boondocks.

07:27.698 --> 07:30.074
I'll take the body back to D. C., Jethro.

07:30.098 --> 07:33.514
But I'm afraid we're gonna have
to rely on this autopsy report.

07:33.538 --> 07:34.674
Can't do another one?

07:34.698 --> 07:36.414
Well, if I think it's necessary,

07:36.438 --> 07:38.744
but there'd be so much missing
that you can't get back.

07:38.768 --> 07:41.344
Blood patterns, position of the body,

07:41.368 --> 07:42.774
and of course you'll be missing

07:42.798 --> 07:44.844
all the usual pieces that
have gone off for testing.

07:44.868 --> 07:46.244
She comes down

07:46.268 --> 07:47.614
from D. C. For the weekend,

07:47.638 --> 07:49.244
books into a motel under a false name,

07:49.268 --> 07:50.844
pays cash and calls a man.

07:50.868 --> 07:51.933
Jealous spouse?

07:51.968 --> 07:53.174
She's not married.

07:53.198 --> 07:54.318
Neither was he.

07:54.368 --> 07:55.544
Moved here six months ago.

07:55.568 --> 07:56.644
Which is about the time.

07:56.668 --> 07:58.214
Lieutenant Shaheen got back from Iraq.

07:58.238 --> 07:59.168
Nice timing.

07:59.238 --> 08:00.614
DiNozzo, drive back with Ducky.

08:00.638 --> 08:01.998
Talk to Lieutenant.

08:02.068 --> 08:03.074
Shaheen's commanding officer.

08:03.098 --> 08:04.914
Find out what she was
working on in Iraq.

08:04.938 --> 08:06.774
Okay, back to the big
city suits me, boss.

08:06.798 --> 08:08.314
I got the Boondock Blues already.

08:08.338 --> 08:09.898
McGee. Boss?

08:09.968 --> 08:11.168
Crime scene.

08:11.238 --> 08:13.044
Take that forensic woman with you.

08:13.068 --> 08:13.998
Ruby.

08:14.068 --> 08:16.338
Ruby, yeah.

08:16.398 --> 08:17.868
Ruby.

08:19.338 --> 08:20.878
Check her methodology.

08:20.938 --> 08:21.974
See what she missed.

08:21.998 --> 08:24.243
Maybe she didn't miss anything.

08:25.898 --> 08:27.538
Right.

08:27.598 --> 08:29.338
What do you need, Duck?

08:29.398 --> 08:31.198
Just the body.

08:31.268 --> 08:34.168
That leaves you and me...

08:34.238 --> 08:36.238
with Masoud Tariq.

08:46.438 --> 08:48.568
Sleepy.

08:48.638 --> 08:50.468
Not quite.

08:50.538 --> 08:52.568
That's Daryl Hardy.

08:52.638 --> 08:56.244
The sort of nosy neighbor
gives small towns a bad name.

08:56.268 --> 08:58.444
He thinks Tariq is a terrorist.

08:58.468 --> 09:01.074
Like a terrorist'd ever come
live in a little town like ours.

09:01.098 --> 09:02.614
He file complaints?

09:02.638 --> 09:04.814
Nothing ever amounted to anything.

09:04.838 --> 09:07.044
Just spread a lot of bad
feelings among people, is all.

09:07.068 --> 09:08.574
Tariq kept out of trouble.

09:08.598 --> 09:10.314
Paid his bills, obeyed the law.

09:10.338 --> 09:11.474
Least up until now.

09:11.498 --> 09:13.098
We're being watched.

09:13.168 --> 09:14.523
That kind of town.

09:22.298 --> 09:24.168
Lacking a woman's touch?

09:25.268 --> 09:27.268
Wouldn't know.

09:42.898 --> 09:44.373
You wanna take mine?

09:45.568 --> 09:47.474
I didn't mean anything
by what I said earlier.

09:47.498 --> 09:49.098
Yes, you did.

09:49.168 --> 09:50.868
You find something?

09:50.938 --> 09:54.838
The sooner you leave me
alone, the sooner I'll know.

09:56.398 --> 09:59.053
Well, I guess a photo can wait, huh?

10:24.798 --> 10:25.798
Gibbs.

10:27.698 --> 10:30.114
I think someone's been
making modifications.

10:30.138 --> 10:31.068
Diesel fuel.

10:31.138 --> 10:32.374
And a positive indicator of nitrates.

10:32.398 --> 10:34.198
Probably ammonium nitrate.

10:34.268 --> 10:36.944
Mix with diesel oil and all you
have to do is add a detonator,

10:36.968 --> 10:40.874
and a cell phone if you
want to set it off remotely.

10:40.898 --> 10:44.388
I think we just found
ourselves a bomb factory.

10:54.258 --> 10:57.164
I thought the local
constabulary searched the house.

10:57.188 --> 10:58.864
Not for a bomb factory.

10:58.888 --> 11:00.458
Hard to miss.

11:01.888 --> 11:04.673
Maybe the neighbors were more observant.

11:08.788 --> 11:10.558
You're from Washington?

11:10.628 --> 11:11.904
Special Agent Gibbs.

11:11.928 --> 11:12.988
NCIS.

11:13.058 --> 11:15.788
NCIS? That like the FBI?

11:15.858 --> 11:17.564
Navy and Marine's version.

11:17.588 --> 11:19.328
About time.

11:19.388 --> 11:21.658
- You found something?
- Maybe.

11:21.728 --> 11:24.188
I knew it.

11:24.258 --> 11:26.104
Sheriff didn't wanna know.

11:26.128 --> 11:27.788
No one did.

11:27.858 --> 11:29.334
It's one of them sleeper cells

11:29.358 --> 11:31.804
they warn us about
on the news, ain't it?

11:31.828 --> 11:33.264
What makes you think that?

11:33.288 --> 11:35.104
I don't think it. I know it.

11:35.128 --> 11:36.658
Wait there.

11:45.558 --> 11:48.434
Waste of time giving
it to that son-of-a-b.

11:48.458 --> 11:50.458
Here.

11:50.528 --> 11:51.828
Good luck.

11:57.558 --> 11:59.328
Nice neighbor?

11:59.388 --> 12:02.004
He thinks he uncovered a sleeper cell.

12:02.028 --> 12:04.358
- Does he have proof?
- Maybe.

12:05.858 --> 12:07.428
Send it to Abby.

12:09.588 --> 12:12.334
So what's your biggest secret? Shock me.

12:12.358 --> 12:13.634
When I was 11 years old,

12:13.658 --> 12:16.034
I had a paper route
and I got sick of it.

12:16.058 --> 12:17.664
So I used to hide the papers

12:17.688 --> 12:20.804
and then I only deliver
to people that complained.

12:20.828 --> 12:22.328
That was you?

12:22.388 --> 12:23.788
No, I mean

12:23.858 --> 12:25.864
like a certain probie who secretly

12:25.888 --> 12:28.004
wrote a not-so-
secret bestseller.

12:28.028 --> 12:29.628
Oh, you mean a MOAS.

12:29.688 --> 12:31.904
Like a mother of all secrets. Yeah.

12:31.928 --> 12:33.104
Everybody has one.

12:33.128 --> 12:35.734
I'm not going to tell
you mine. What's yours?

12:35.758 --> 12:37.558
Ha! Nice try.

12:37.628 --> 12:40.388
I'm sitting on my MOAS.

12:40.458 --> 12:42.034
I thought there was only one shooter?

12:42.058 --> 12:43.704
So did the Boondock Probie.

12:43.728 --> 12:46.488
Maybe she was wrong.

12:46.558 --> 12:49.228
Well, find out soon enough.

12:49.288 --> 12:51.304
How do you live with the
Mother Of All Secrets?

12:51.328 --> 12:52.388
You don't.

12:52.458 --> 12:53.534
It consumes you.

12:53.558 --> 12:55.104
It eats you like a
cancer, from the inside.

12:55.128 --> 12:57.328
First there's the guilt.

12:57.388 --> 12:59.204
And then there's the excruciating urge

12:59.228 --> 13:01.034
to blab your secret, although you know

13:01.058 --> 13:04.088
that it's gonna spell your doom.

13:04.158 --> 13:05.804
Have you gotten at that stage yet?

13:05.828 --> 13:09.264
No. It's a hypothetical
situation we're talking about.

13:09.288 --> 13:12.003
You're still in the guilt stage, huh?

13:12.158 --> 13:14.134
And then, you know, eventually,

13:14.158 --> 13:16.264
you can't take it anymore,
it drives you insane,

13:16.288 --> 13:17.904
so you blab your secret

13:17.928 --> 13:20.164
to your best friend or your mother

13:20.188 --> 13:21.804
or your lover and it sets you free.

13:21.828 --> 13:23.628
- It does?
- Yeah.

13:23.688 --> 13:25.664
Of course, you lose all your friends

13:25.688 --> 13:27.364
and your family and maybe even your job

13:27.388 --> 13:28.904
depending on what the
secret is, but, yeah.

13:28.928 --> 13:30.558
Great.

13:34.428 --> 13:37.988
Masoud Tariq has another name:

13:38.058 --> 13:40.328
Wasim Al Fulani.

13:40.388 --> 13:42.558
Oh, this is bad.

13:42.628 --> 13:44.704
He was in the Republican Guard.

13:44.728 --> 13:48.273
Yeah, it's a long way
from Baghdad to Edenvale.

13:48.428 --> 13:51.428
I hate giving Gibbs bad news.

13:51.488 --> 13:53.188
Yeah, got it.

13:53.258 --> 13:54.804
He dropped off the planet,
like, two years ago, boss.

13:54.828 --> 13:57.504
Ziva just sent over photos
of two men with Tariq

13:57.528 --> 13:58.904
both Middle Eastern, same deal.

13:58.928 --> 14:01.488
"Masoud Tariq" is an alias.

14:01.558 --> 14:03.364
His real name is Wasim Al Fulani,

14:03.388 --> 14:05.264
former captain, Republican Guard,

14:05.288 --> 14:06.904
disappeared off the radar two years ago.

14:06.928 --> 14:09.204
Hmm, we know where he's
been for the past six months.

14:09.228 --> 14:11.134
Just need to figure out where he is now.

14:11.158 --> 14:13.638
Yeah, and whether he packed a bag.

14:17.328 --> 14:19.304
Okay, thanks for the bad news.

14:19.328 --> 14:21.158
Yeah. Bye.

14:21.228 --> 14:23.704
They found explosive
residue in Tariq's garage.

14:23.728 --> 14:25.104
Well, that's not good.

14:25.128 --> 14:27.134
Yeah, I dusted for
prints in that garage.

14:27.158 --> 14:28.734
Well, sometimes we miss things.

14:28.758 --> 14:31.064
Like that second shell
casing we still can't find

14:31.088 --> 14:33.128
and probably never will?

14:33.188 --> 14:35.128
This is my first.

14:35.188 --> 14:36.728
- First?
- Murder.

14:36.788 --> 14:40.034
I'd only ever done
break-ins and stolen cars.

14:40.058 --> 14:42.634
We get a lot of stolen cars in Edenvale.

14:42.658 --> 14:43.658
I bet.

14:43.688 --> 14:45.358
I'm so excited.

14:45.428 --> 14:46.608
My first murder.

14:46.658 --> 14:48.364
I mean, it's sad and everything, but...

14:48.388 --> 14:49.964
No, it's okay to be excited.

14:49.988 --> 14:51.404
Helps us do our job.

14:51.428 --> 14:53.464
Well, it sure didn't help me, did it?

14:53.488 --> 14:56.758
Look, you might've
missed something, okay?

14:56.828 --> 14:58.634
But, next time, you might see something

14:58.658 --> 14:59.834
that someone else doesn't.

14:59.858 --> 15:02.334
And they might see
something that you don't.

15:02.358 --> 15:04.288
You can't do it all.

15:04.358 --> 15:05.604
Can't be right every time, Ruby.

15:05.628 --> 15:08.388
I'd settle for just once.

15:18.928 --> 15:20.504
Never thought I'd see
a grown man so happy

15:20.528 --> 15:21.564
to break a hundred.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.064
This coming from the girl who rolled

15:23.088 --> 15:24.588
an 86.

15:24.658 --> 15:25.728
Eighty-nine.

15:25.788 --> 15:27.628
Whatever.

15:27.688 --> 15:29.828
Competitive. I like it.

15:29.888 --> 15:31.964
I have a question to ask you. Yeah?

15:31.988 --> 15:36.134
What are the chances of my sneaking
you away for a little dinner?

15:36.158 --> 15:39.158
Two of the interns called in sick, so...

15:39.228 --> 15:40.988
Whoo, that's not good.

15:41.058 --> 15:43.864
You look cold and we can't
have you getting sick.

15:43.888 --> 15:46.464
Mm-hmm. There... it's a little chilly.

15:46.488 --> 15:49.553
And it's a good thing
that I am prepared.

15:54.788 --> 15:56.258
Signorina...

15:56.328 --> 15:59.058
What are you doing?

16:03.088 --> 16:04.834
It's easier than it looks.

16:04.858 --> 16:06.128
Yeah, okay...

16:07.158 --> 16:08.828
This is not a sundial.

16:13.228 --> 16:14.828
There we go.

16:20.488 --> 16:21.988
What is all this?

16:22.058 --> 16:26.128
This, Miss Benoit, is a Penne

16:26.188 --> 16:27.388
a la DiNardo.

16:27.458 --> 16:28.734
I don't know what to say.

16:28.758 --> 16:29.958
Well...

16:30.028 --> 16:31.264
you could say, Grazie,

16:31.288 --> 16:32.364
"you're a god among men,

16:32.388 --> 16:34.158
a prince among thieves."

16:34.228 --> 16:37.118
This is like a scene from an old movie.

16:37.988 --> 16:40.904
Wait a second is this a
scene from an old movie?

16:40.928 --> 16:43.588
Uh, well, that really depends.

16:43.658 --> 16:44.988
On...?

16:45.058 --> 16:46.504
Have you ever seen a movie called.

16:46.528 --> 16:48.004
Strangers in the Night, with Cary Grant?

16:48.028 --> 16:49.204
No, I don't think so.

16:49.228 --> 16:51.234
Then no, this is a
completely original idea

16:51.258 --> 16:53.853
that I came up with, all by myself.

17:15.328 --> 17:17.758
It's not even close, Abigail.

17:21.958 --> 17:23.028
Shalom.

17:23.088 --> 17:24.358
Morning.

17:24.428 --> 17:25.733
You brew that in your room?

17:25.758 --> 17:27.088
Yeah.

17:27.157 --> 17:29.779
You know, it's not even real coffee.

17:29.803 --> 17:30.634
It's coffee.

17:30.658 --> 17:31.734
I read the label.

17:31.758 --> 17:33.734
"Roasted chicory," whatever that is.

17:33.758 --> 17:34.804
It's a flower.

17:34.828 --> 17:36.264
It's got a taproot like a dandelion.

17:36.288 --> 17:38.634
Dried and roasted, it makes
for a cheap coffee substitute.

17:38.658 --> 17:40.164
Well, that's what you're drinking,

17:40.188 --> 17:41.734
cheap motel coffee substitute.

17:41.758 --> 17:43.764
Does that smell like a
cheap coffee substitute?

17:43.788 --> 17:46.404
- Well, you brew it in your room.
- Well, yes, I did.

17:46.428 --> 17:49.104
With my own grind that
I brought from home.

17:49.128 --> 17:52.664
You bring your own coffee
grind on investigations?

17:52.688 --> 17:54.168
Only on overnighters.

17:55.988 --> 17:58.304
Did you hear from Tony last night?

17:58.328 --> 17:59.628
No.

17:59.688 --> 18:01.343
How about this morning?

18:02.328 --> 18:03.564
The only reason I'm asking you

18:03.588 --> 18:04.904
is because I called him
last night to update him

18:04.928 --> 18:06.304
and he didn't pick up the phone.

18:06.328 --> 18:08.934
He didn't answer this morning either.

18:08.958 --> 18:12.228
Ah, you two got married
and didn't tell me.

18:12.288 --> 18:15.488
No. I know this may sound a bit strange,

18:15.558 --> 18:16.434
coming from me, but...

18:16.458 --> 18:17.464
More than a bit, Ziva.

18:17.488 --> 18:18.958
He's my partner,

18:19.028 --> 18:20.364
and I'm concerned. Yeah, okay. So?

18:20.388 --> 18:22.264
So you sent him back for other reasons

18:22.288 --> 18:25.369
than to question Lieutenant
Shaheen's commanding officer.

18:25.393 --> 18:27.403
Did I miss the announcement?

18:29.146 --> 18:32.258
No, I was not made Director of NCIS.

18:32.328 --> 18:34.804
I was thinking more like
Secretary of the Navy,

18:34.828 --> 18:37.704
because the Director of
NCIS would know damn well

18:37.728 --> 18:39.634
not to ask me such a stupid question.

18:39.658 --> 18:43.634
Look, Tony's been very
secretive lately, and for a man

18:43.658 --> 18:45.734
who can't keep what he
had for breakfast a secret,

18:45.758 --> 18:47.104
I think it's scary.

18:47.128 --> 18:48.904
What's scary is your persistence.

18:48.928 --> 18:50.758
Sorry!

18:52.258 --> 18:56.513
So the only reason you sent
him back was what you said...

19:02.528 --> 19:04.458
Can I talk bullets?

19:04.528 --> 19:08.404
No, you can't, but you can
listen to me talk bullets.

19:08.428 --> 19:10.204
Now, the first bullet, bullet "A".

19:10.228 --> 19:11.928
Yes, that's it

19:11.988 --> 19:15.534
it penetrated the body here,
just below the rib cage.

19:15.558 --> 19:17.828
All soft tissue, no bone.

19:17.888 --> 19:20.004
But once it punched through the skin,

19:20.028 --> 19:22.258
it stopped no kinetic energy.

19:22.328 --> 19:23.653
Unlike bullet "B".

19:23.688 --> 19:25.664
Yeah, that's the little devil

19:25.688 --> 19:26.664
which according to this,

19:26.688 --> 19:28.564
punched right through the sternum,

19:28.588 --> 19:30.264
gouged its way through the heart muscle,

19:30.288 --> 19:31.734
took a chip out of the eighth

19:31.758 --> 19:32.904
thoracic vertebrae

19:32.928 --> 19:34.964
and finally sputtered to a stop

19:34.988 --> 19:37.204
in Lieutenant Shaheen's
right latissimus dorsi.

19:37.228 --> 19:38.348
In other words,

19:38.388 --> 19:40.904
it did exactly what
it was designed to do

19:40.928 --> 19:42.264
in all its brutal efficiency.

19:42.288 --> 19:44.334
Which begs the question, Abby...

19:44.358 --> 19:46.364
How were they fired
from the same weapon?

19:46.388 --> 19:48.934
Yeah, one high velocity,
one low velocity.

19:48.958 --> 19:51.064
I was thinking, could it be a ricochet?

19:51.088 --> 19:54.164
No, there were no layer
deposits on the slug,

19:54.188 --> 19:55.534
so it didn't hit anything. Ah.

19:55.558 --> 19:57.934
And their weight and lead
composition's the same,

19:57.958 --> 19:59.734
but it's almost as if...

19:59.758 --> 20:01.504
it was fired from another weapon.

20:01.528 --> 20:03.204
And if it was a revolver,

20:03.228 --> 20:07.028
that would explain
finding only one casing.

20:07.088 --> 20:09.004
Two weapons means two shooters, Duck.

20:09.028 --> 20:10.464
I don't think Gibbs is going

20:10.488 --> 20:13.213
to appreciate me doubling his workload.

20:21.788 --> 20:23.088
Morning.

20:23.158 --> 20:25.868
So, you going to call 'em or will I?

20:26.928 --> 20:28.128
The FBI.

20:28.188 --> 20:32.164
I'm beginning to think Daryl
Hardy was right, after all.

20:32.188 --> 20:33.734
Still NCIS jurisdiction.

20:33.758 --> 20:37.628
Till he sets off a
bomb in the local mall.

20:37.688 --> 20:39.304
That'd be a good time for it to be

20:39.328 --> 20:43.118
under someone else's
jurisdiction, wouldn't you say?

20:46.828 --> 20:49.258
That's him. That's Tariq!

20:49.328 --> 20:50.788
Stop right there!

20:51.728 --> 20:52.728
Cease fire!

20:53.958 --> 20:56.258
Hey! Cease fire!

20:56.328 --> 20:57.788
Put it down!

21:30.222 --> 21:32.698
Hey... it's a circus out there.

21:32.722 --> 21:34.758
Every deputy in the county
is either in the E. R.,

21:34.782 --> 21:35.858
the building or the parking lot.

21:35.882 --> 21:37.458
Everyone loves a shooting.

21:37.482 --> 21:38.628
Except the shootee.

21:38.652 --> 21:40.682
Is that a word?

21:40.752 --> 21:42.528
Sounds like a word.
Do you want to spell?

21:42.552 --> 21:44.522
S- H-O-O-T-E-E.

21:44.582 --> 21:46.798
No, no, no, no, no.
Uh,"spell: As in "rest."

21:46.822 --> 21:48.177
Oh, no. Thank you.

21:50.822 --> 21:52.998
They're going to hold him here
for a couple of hours, then we're

21:53.022 --> 21:54.728
moving him back to D. C.

21:54.752 --> 21:57.528
Check his clothes and the
pickup for explosive residue.

21:57.552 --> 21:59.317
I can get Ruby to help.

22:00.882 --> 22:02.482
Or not.

22:08.582 --> 22:09.922
Did you shoot me?

22:09.982 --> 22:11.022
No.

22:11.082 --> 22:13.622
Did she? No.

22:13.682 --> 22:14.822
Sheriff Barrett?

22:14.882 --> 22:15.952
Possibly.

22:16.022 --> 22:17.182
His brother?

22:17.252 --> 22:18.652
Probably.

22:20.552 --> 22:22.022
Why'd you run?

22:22.082 --> 22:25.698
In Baghdad, when you see men
with guns, you go the other way.

22:25.722 --> 22:27.322
It's what you do.

22:27.382 --> 22:30.222
You all seemed very eager to shoot me.

22:30.282 --> 22:32.482
You were armed.

22:32.552 --> 22:35.562
You couldn't see it.
And it was unloaded.

22:36.922 --> 22:38.358
Where have you been for the past

22:38.382 --> 22:40.282
four days? Deer hunting.

22:40.352 --> 22:43.487
Rana Shaheen was shot
dead over the weekend.

22:44.922 --> 22:48.407
Right after she came to
see you in your house.

22:49.022 --> 22:51.622
Of course.

22:51.682 --> 22:53.658
That means I must be a murderer.

22:53.682 --> 22:55.028
At least in this town.

22:55.052 --> 22:56.552
I'm curious.

22:56.622 --> 22:58.698
What else are they accusing me of?

22:58.722 --> 23:01.298
We found traces of
explosives in your garage.

23:01.322 --> 23:04.058
So now I am the monster
that scares them at night.

23:04.082 --> 23:06.182
Al-Qaeda come to kill them.

23:08.022 --> 23:09.398
Do you believe this?

23:09.422 --> 23:10.728
I don't know what to believe,

23:10.752 --> 23:12.782
Wasim Al Fulani.

23:18.229 --> 23:19.382
Lab.

23:19.482 --> 23:21.128
Give me some good news, Abby.

23:21.152 --> 23:22.522
I'm not pregnant.

23:22.582 --> 23:24.422
Too much information.

23:24.482 --> 23:25.998
I'm just kidding. Not
that there's anything wrong

23:26.022 --> 23:27.128
with being pregnant; I love kids.

23:27.152 --> 23:29.458
Doesn't mean that I'm trying, you know.

23:29.482 --> 23:31.328
And even if I were
trying, it doesn't mean

23:31.352 --> 23:32.698
I know anybody that I
would want to try with.

23:32.722 --> 23:33.728
Am I being trying, Gibbs?

23:33.752 --> 23:34.782
Affirmative.

23:34.852 --> 23:35.928
My guess is that you want to know

23:35.952 --> 23:37.158
about the two guys in the photos.

23:37.182 --> 23:38.898
That's a good guess, Abby.

23:38.922 --> 23:41.422
Well, don't hold your breath.

23:41.482 --> 23:43.228
There are three-quarter
profiles, no full face.

23:43.252 --> 23:45.228
Not really good for a match.
I think we're out of luck.

23:45.252 --> 23:46.828
Evidence turning up anything?

23:46.852 --> 23:50.582
Um, I'm beginning to
think that she was shot

23:50.652 --> 23:51.898
with two different weapons.

23:51.922 --> 23:55.817
They're both nine mils,
but I can't match the slugs

23:55.852 --> 23:58.098
and Ducky said they hit the
body at two different velocities.

23:58.122 --> 23:59.358
Like, really different.

23:59.382 --> 24:01.458
Like, the difference between
a howitzer and a BB gun.

24:01.482 --> 24:02.658
Maybe not that different,

24:02.682 --> 24:04.958
but Ducky's really
puzzled about it, too.

24:04.982 --> 24:06.598
You telling me there were
two different shooters?

24:06.622 --> 24:07.622
Maybe.

24:07.652 --> 24:08.952
Or maybe not.

24:09.022 --> 24:09.998
I haven't figured it out yet.

24:10.022 --> 24:11.452
When you do, Abs...

24:11.522 --> 24:13.258
You will be the first to know.

24:13.282 --> 24:15.028
Actually, technically,
you'll be the second to know

24:15.052 --> 24:16.098
because I'm doing the testing,

24:16.122 --> 24:18.717
but you will be the second to know.

24:19.182 --> 24:20.682
Gibbs?

24:20.752 --> 24:22.728
We don't normally open
these files to just anyone.

24:22.752 --> 24:25.422
I guess NCIS isn't "just anyone."

24:25.482 --> 24:26.898
Lieutenant Shaheen had

24:26.922 --> 24:28.828
a certain amount of
autonomy, Agent DiNozzo.

24:28.852 --> 24:31.328
Sounds like a Marine covering his butt.

24:31.352 --> 24:32.828
Marine officers don't cover their butts.

24:32.852 --> 24:35.198
I've uploaded the files
on the work we did in Iraq.

24:35.222 --> 24:36.898
Code name was "Operation Cauldron."

24:36.922 --> 24:38.222
Classification?

24:38.282 --> 24:41.297
Top secret, strictly
a need-to-know basis.

24:41.322 --> 24:43.498
Lieutenant Shaheen was
one of the best I had.

24:43.522 --> 24:45.252
You find who did this.

24:45.322 --> 24:48.182
Working on it.

24:55.682 --> 24:58.298
Do you have any more indicator spray?

24:58.322 --> 25:01.228
I hope this doesn't
count as helping you.

25:01.252 --> 25:02.758
I'd hate to get you in trouble.

25:02.782 --> 25:04.182
Thanks.

25:04.252 --> 25:07.677
I bet he didn't even
read my evidence report.

25:08.082 --> 25:11.082
Did you read my evidence report?

25:12.822 --> 25:14.482
Sorry. Not yet.

25:14.552 --> 25:15.682
Not ever.

25:15.752 --> 25:17.998
I promise I will read
your evidence report.

25:18.022 --> 25:19.522
What, and grade me?

25:21.052 --> 25:23.198
Look, I'm sorry that you're
not allowed to help me.

25:23.222 --> 25:24.552
It's just...

25:24.622 --> 25:26.098
He doesn't trust me.

25:26.122 --> 25:29.498
Well, see, he would
if-if he got to know you.

25:29.522 --> 25:33.022
It's just, um, he's hard to get to know.

25:33.082 --> 25:36.852
Make sure you do inside
his trouser pockets.

25:36.922 --> 25:41.122
People put their hands in
their pockets to get their keys

25:41.182 --> 25:42.998
and the explosive residue rubs off.

25:43.022 --> 25:45.352
Gonna read your evidence report.

25:45.422 --> 25:46.582
I promise.

26:05.282 --> 26:06.322
Yeah. Gibbs.

26:06.382 --> 26:07.622
Hey, boss,

26:07.682 --> 26:10.128
Lieutenant Shaheen worked
on Operation Cauldron

26:10.152 --> 26:11.452
in Iraq.

26:11.522 --> 26:13.098
In return for high-quality intel

26:13.122 --> 26:14.328
about terrorist bombers,

26:14.352 --> 26:17.852
Uncle Sam relocated
informants to the U. S.

26:17.922 --> 26:21.098
Kind of a witness relocation
deal for born-again bad guys.

26:21.122 --> 26:24.682
Anyway, Wasim Al Fulani was one of them;

26:24.752 --> 26:26.798
Relocated here six months
ago, new name, passport,

26:26.822 --> 26:27.928
whole nine yards.

26:27.952 --> 26:30.228
Lieutenant Shaheen was his case officer.

26:30.252 --> 26:31.628
Yeah, and there's something else.

26:31.652 --> 26:33.928
Two other guys relocated
at the same time,

26:33.952 --> 26:35.728
but their computer
files have been deleted.

26:35.752 --> 26:37.052
Hard copies?

26:37.122 --> 26:38.398
Both unaccounted for.

26:38.422 --> 26:40.428
Last person to sign him
out was Lieutenant Shaheen

26:40.452 --> 26:41.458
and you'll never guess when.

26:41.482 --> 26:43.498
The day she went to Edenvale.

26:43.522 --> 26:44.952
You guessed.

26:49.052 --> 26:50.682
You're a Jew.

26:52.882 --> 26:53.822
Yes.

26:53.882 --> 26:55.922
Israeli?

26:58.282 --> 26:59.722
Mossad, then.

26:59.782 --> 27:01.258
I'm working with NCIS.

27:01.282 --> 27:03.322
So, yes.

27:03.382 --> 27:04.782
So, now,

27:04.852 --> 27:08.092
I am as suspicious of
you as you are of me.

27:10.152 --> 27:12.628
Is it always going to be this way?

27:12.652 --> 27:15.522
At least in our lifetime.

27:16.652 --> 27:18.622
Ooh, cozy.

27:18.682 --> 27:20.852
Can I help you?

27:20.922 --> 27:25.082
You know, couple of
more inches to your right

27:25.152 --> 27:28.582
and our martyr here
could've been living it up

27:28.652 --> 27:30.628
with all those vestal virgins.

27:30.652 --> 27:32.598
You know, it truly is
a screwed-up religion

27:32.622 --> 27:34.858
where you got to blow yourself up

27:34.882 --> 27:36.682
just to get lucky.

27:38.782 --> 27:41.428
When you insult his religion,
you insult mine and your own.

27:41.452 --> 27:44.382
Tell him you're sorry.

27:44.452 --> 27:45.822
Sorry.

27:47.282 --> 27:49.228
I don't think he heard you.

27:49.252 --> 27:52.222
I'm sorry.

27:52.282 --> 27:53.782
Apology accepted.

27:59.152 --> 28:01.052
There a problem?

28:01.122 --> 28:03.198
I was telling the deputy here

28:03.222 --> 28:04.877
where the bathroom was.

28:05.882 --> 28:08.182
I know about Operation Cauldron.

28:08.252 --> 28:12.822
Good. Then you know that I'm
not in your country illegally.

28:12.882 --> 28:16.182
Lieutenant Shaheen
was your case officer.

28:16.252 --> 28:18.998
Yes. She was the only American
I ever met whom I trusted.

28:19.022 --> 28:20.798
So you kept in touch with her?

28:20.822 --> 28:22.922
No, it was forbidden.

28:22.982 --> 28:24.598
I gave them information,
they gave me a new life.

28:24.622 --> 28:26.158
She came to visit you

28:26.182 --> 28:27.698
I did not invite her.

28:27.722 --> 28:28.958
Why did she come?

28:28.982 --> 28:30.798
An unmarried woman visiting
a Muslim man's home?

28:30.822 --> 28:32.482
It was not for that.

28:32.552 --> 28:33.758
So you were disappointed,

28:33.782 --> 28:35.358
and that's why you followed
her back to the motel.

28:35.382 --> 28:36.958
No. Maybe she saw something

28:36.982 --> 28:38.858
in your garage you
didn't want her to see.

28:38.882 --> 28:40.728
A bomb perhaps, Agent Gibbs?

28:40.752 --> 28:42.928
Explosives. Somebody put 'em there.

28:42.952 --> 28:44.752
Not me.

28:44.822 --> 28:47.498
Why don't you go talk to
Mr. Hardy, my good neighbor?

28:47.522 --> 28:50.412
Maybe he put them there or saw who did.

28:53.082 --> 28:55.758
My wife and daughter
were killed buying fruit

28:55.782 --> 28:56.758
in a Baghdad market,

28:56.782 --> 28:57.782
Agent Gibbs.

28:57.822 --> 29:00.182
I've seen enough bombs.

29:00.252 --> 29:03.352
That's why I did what I did.

29:03.422 --> 29:06.552
That's why I left.

29:06.622 --> 29:08.652
Boss, you got a minute?

29:14.882 --> 29:16.622
Found something.

29:22.982 --> 29:25.498
It doesn't look like
explosive residue, McGee.

29:25.522 --> 29:26.782
It's Ruby's.

29:26.852 --> 29:28.928
She uses a red florescent
powder to dust for prints.

29:28.952 --> 29:30.482
So?

29:30.552 --> 29:31.682
So we don't.

29:31.752 --> 29:33.158
The only way this could've gotten

29:33.182 --> 29:34.458
on the back of the cell phone,

29:34.482 --> 29:36.658
is if it was planted after
she dusted for prints.

29:36.682 --> 29:39.422
Someone set him up, boss.

29:39.482 --> 29:41.858
I don't like what you're
getting at, Agent Gibbs.

29:41.882 --> 29:43.098
Do you have a better explanation?

29:43.122 --> 29:44.098
People like living here.

29:44.122 --> 29:45.328
They go to church on Sundays

29:45.352 --> 29:46.598
and they obey the law, mostly.

29:46.622 --> 29:48.998
And they believe every
person, even a stranger,

29:49.022 --> 29:50.658
is guilty until proven innocent.

29:50.682 --> 29:53.298
You mean innocent until proven guilty.

29:53.322 --> 29:55.198
Yeah, well, that's the
way it used to be before...

29:55.222 --> 29:56.782
Masoud arrived?

29:56.852 --> 29:59.482
Before everyone got so damn scared.

29:59.552 --> 30:02.798
Well, then you know why
I asked the question.

30:02.822 --> 30:04.522
Have a seat.

30:04.582 --> 30:08.198
Look, half the town would
have planted those explosives

30:08.222 --> 30:09.458
just to get rid of Masoud.

30:09.482 --> 30:11.528
Half the town didn't
have a key to his house.

30:11.552 --> 30:13.158
The house was leased. The owner?

30:13.182 --> 30:15.582
Martha Hollingway, 84 years old.

30:15.652 --> 30:16.522
Unlikely.

30:16.582 --> 30:18.682
Who else had access to it?

30:20.922 --> 30:24.322
Oh, my Lord.

30:24.382 --> 30:26.322
You think I killed her?

30:26.382 --> 30:27.152
Did you?

30:27.222 --> 30:28.328
I was radio officer

30:28.352 --> 30:29.998
the night she was murdered.

30:30.022 --> 30:32.058
I didn't leave the conference
room the whole night.

30:32.082 --> 30:33.682
Tell him, Tom.

30:33.752 --> 30:34.682
It's true.

30:34.752 --> 30:37.682
You big-time Washington, D. C. Guys,

30:37.752 --> 30:39.598
you blow in here so smart.

30:39.622 --> 30:42.222
Think you got all the answers.

30:42.282 --> 30:43.858
You don't know squat about this town.

30:43.882 --> 30:45.682
Educate us.

30:45.752 --> 30:47.652
Everyone knows he did it.

30:47.722 --> 30:50.428
Nobody's trusted this guy
since the moment he got here.

30:50.452 --> 30:52.082
She was at his house.

30:52.152 --> 30:54.217
Maybe they're getting it on.

30:54.252 --> 30:55.698
They had a fight. Who knows?

30:55.722 --> 30:59.498
Or maybe... maybe she figured
out what he's really up to.

30:59.522 --> 31:00.822
Making bombs?

31:00.882 --> 31:04.652
Doesn't surprise me.

31:09.252 --> 31:11.352
Our country is at war.

31:11.422 --> 31:14.928
Alert-level orange, in case
you happened to not notice.

31:14.952 --> 31:18.352
We are told to keep an eye on people

31:18.422 --> 31:19.598
who are behaving suspiciously.

31:19.622 --> 31:22.322
I was doing my job.

31:22.382 --> 31:24.958
I told you we needed to keep
a better eye on that Iraqi.

31:24.982 --> 31:26.982
You never listened to me.

31:27.052 --> 31:29.198
Is that why you planted explosives?

31:29.222 --> 31:32.382
I didn't plant any explosives.

31:32.452 --> 31:33.582
McGee?

31:35.752 --> 31:38.982
Deputy, please take off your trousers.

31:40.782 --> 31:42.298
You know what? Screw you, McGee.

31:42.322 --> 31:43.522
Tyler.

31:43.582 --> 31:46.182
If you prefer,

31:46.252 --> 31:49.912
I can get Officer David
to take 'em off for you.

32:17.022 --> 32:20.022
Guess that's not your favorite color.

32:24.022 --> 32:26.928
I was just getting him before he got us.

32:26.952 --> 32:31.447
It's too bad you weren't getting
Lieutenant Shaheen's killer.

32:43.381 --> 32:44.987
Doctors released Masoud.

32:45.011 --> 32:45.987
He's in the car.

32:46.011 --> 32:46.941
Hey! McGee.

32:47.011 --> 32:48.901
Yeah, ready to roll, boss.

32:54.781 --> 32:56.481
Uh, you're leaving?

32:56.541 --> 32:59.311
Yeah, back to D. C.

32:59.381 --> 33:00.857
Thank you for your help.

33:00.881 --> 33:03.011
Yeah, some help I was.

33:03.081 --> 33:04.817
No, no, no, you were. Honest.

33:04.841 --> 33:06.281
We, uh,

33:06.341 --> 33:08.887
found some bomb residue
on the deputy's pants.

33:08.911 --> 33:11.511
Same pocket where he keeps his keys.

33:12.481 --> 33:14.841
I, uh, have your report.

33:14.911 --> 33:16.457
I will read it; I promise.

33:16.481 --> 33:17.841
Bye, McGee.

33:17.911 --> 33:20.281
Bye.

33:22.741 --> 33:24.957
Well, no one could ride Blackie.

33:24.981 --> 33:29.081
He was a warm-blood, stood
18 hands at the withers.

33:29.141 --> 33:32.087
I don't know what I
measure at the withers.

33:32.111 --> 33:34.001
We can measure me tonight.

33:34.041 --> 33:36.141
What time do you get off?

33:36.211 --> 33:37.757
Uh... I gotta go.

33:37.781 --> 33:38.787
I'll see you then.

33:38.811 --> 33:40.657
You have a tape measure at your place?

33:40.681 --> 33:41.611
Good.

33:41.681 --> 33:42.981
Hey. Hey.

33:44.441 --> 33:46.011
Taking calls again?

33:46.081 --> 33:47.681
Never stopped, boss.

33:47.741 --> 33:49.387
Why? Did I miss your call?

33:49.411 --> 33:51.011
No, not mine.

33:51.081 --> 33:52.387
What'd you find out about Masoud?

33:52.411 --> 33:53.557
This guy was good, boss.

33:53.581 --> 33:55.946
Gave the Marines some hard intel.

33:55.981 --> 33:57.117
IED factories, weapons caches,

33:57.141 --> 33:58.987
and the names of more than 50 bad boys.

33:59.011 --> 34:01.081
He deserves a medal.

34:01.141 --> 34:03.017
Got a U. S. Passport instead.

34:03.041 --> 34:05.187
What about the other two
who relocated with him?

34:05.211 --> 34:06.887
Yeah, low level stuff mostly.

34:06.911 --> 34:08.607
Nothing to get excited about.

34:08.630 --> 34:10.317
Couple of names, a weapons cache.

34:10.341 --> 34:13.487
But good old Uncle Sam gave
'em both passports anyway.

34:13.511 --> 34:14.866
He's ready, Gibbs.

34:16.181 --> 34:18.581
DiNozzo, run these plates.

34:18.641 --> 34:19.981
Sure thing, boss.

34:22.011 --> 34:24.481
Why didn't you answer my calls?

34:24.541 --> 34:26.757
Gibbs just asked me that.
I think I had it on silent.

34:26.781 --> 34:29.380
Your other phone is never on silent.

34:36.341 --> 34:38.657
Don't tell me, probie, let me guess.

34:38.681 --> 34:41.041
Research for the next book?

34:41.110 --> 34:42.817
No, it's Ruby's evidence report.

34:42.841 --> 34:45.281
Ah, another work of fiction, then.

34:45.341 --> 34:47.357
If it is, she's a
better writer than I am.

34:47.380 --> 34:48.380
Probie,

34:48.411 --> 34:50.087
I have a pimple on my left buttock

34:50.110 --> 34:51.717
that is a better writer than you are.

34:51.741 --> 34:53.110
Ruby, it's McGee.

34:53.181 --> 34:55.016
You need to get to Washington.

34:55.041 --> 34:56.187
I do? When?

34:56.210 --> 34:58.511
Now.

34:58.581 --> 35:01.217
Why did Lieutenant Shaheen come to you?

35:01.241 --> 35:03.741
She was investigating someone.

35:03.811 --> 35:06.111
Who?

35:06.181 --> 35:08.287
Two Iraqi men who relocated with me.

35:08.311 --> 35:10.987
I didn't meet them un...
until I left Baghdad.

35:11.011 --> 35:12.317
They were on the same flight.

35:12.341 --> 35:14.741
When did you last see them?

35:14.811 --> 35:18.786
Lieutenant Shaheen asked me
precisely the same question.

35:22.141 --> 35:23.856
Edenvale, two weeks ago.

35:26.841 --> 35:29.281
This them?

35:29.341 --> 35:31.641
Yes.

35:33.381 --> 35:34.941
They were nervous.

35:35.011 --> 35:37.057
They wanted to know what
information I passed on

35:37.081 --> 35:39.611
to the Marines in Baghdad.

35:39.681 --> 35:41.781
You told them?

35:41.841 --> 35:43.881
No, I lied.

35:43.941 --> 35:45.957
I told them I gave them bad information.

35:45.981 --> 35:47.511
They believed me.

35:47.581 --> 35:50.657
They said they had passed
on bad information, too.

35:50.681 --> 35:52.981
Why did you lie?

35:53.041 --> 35:57.041
Because I trust no one, Agent Gibbs.

35:58.541 --> 36:00.857
Why was Lieutenant
Shaheen investigating them?

36:00.881 --> 36:02.471
She wouldn't tell me.

36:05.981 --> 36:07.341
Names.

36:07.411 --> 36:10.011
I don't know.

36:10.081 --> 36:14.141
Did these men kill Lieutenant
Shaheen, Agent Gibbs?

36:16.141 --> 36:18.681
Yeah, I got it, thanks.

36:18.741 --> 36:21.911
Hey, Major Raines gave
us their names, boss.

36:21.981 --> 36:23.557
Asad Al Qutaji and Youssef Zidan.

36:23.581 --> 36:25.917
They're sharing a house in Washington.

36:25.941 --> 36:27.817
No record of employment
since they arrived.

36:27.841 --> 36:29.657
Abby thinks there could
have been two shooters.

36:29.681 --> 36:31.217
Get Major Raines in here.

36:31.241 --> 36:32.457
Already on his way.

36:32.481 --> 36:33.981
McGee.

36:34.041 --> 36:35.117
Get down here.

36:35.141 --> 36:36.581
I think Ruby...

36:36.641 --> 36:38.611
Thanks.

36:38.681 --> 36:40.211
Boss.

36:40.281 --> 36:43.057
Think there's something you need to see.

36:43.081 --> 36:45.217
It was in the report,
only no one read it.

36:45.241 --> 36:46.411
What report?

36:46.481 --> 36:47.457
Ruby's report.

36:47.481 --> 36:48.887
She just got here. Hey, Ruby.

36:48.911 --> 36:50.091
Hi, Agent Gibbs.

36:51.341 --> 36:53.617
Uh, bear with us here for a second.

36:53.641 --> 36:54.817
You're gonna love this, Gibbs.

36:54.841 --> 36:56.557
- Ready?
- Okay.

36:56.581 --> 36:58.757
So the shell casing I
collected from the crime scene

36:58.781 --> 37:01.617
had quite a lot of
undischarged powder in it.

37:01.641 --> 37:05.611
It was all kind of clogged
inside, so I did a test.

37:05.681 --> 37:07.517
This is the same amount of powder found

37:07.541 --> 37:09.966
in a normal nine millimeter shell.

37:10.981 --> 37:13.381
And this is similar

37:13.441 --> 37:16.511
to the powder I found
in our shell casing.

37:19.111 --> 37:21.311
A bit like my last boyfriend.

37:21.381 --> 37:22.687
The powder was degraded

37:22.711 --> 37:23.987
by some type of oil.

37:24.011 --> 37:25.757
The first round didn't
even leave the barrel,

37:25.781 --> 37:27.441
so he fired again.

37:27.511 --> 37:29.087
The second round hit the first,

37:29.111 --> 37:31.087
and they both left the barrel in tandem.

37:31.111 --> 37:32.481
Which is why

37:32.541 --> 37:34.617
the first round was at low velocity

37:34.641 --> 37:37.017
and the second round was all mashed up

37:37.041 --> 37:38.581
and unrecognizable.

37:38.641 --> 37:40.987
I'm surprised the barrel didn't rupture.

37:41.011 --> 37:41.976
Maybe it did.

37:42.011 --> 37:44.187
Not two weapons, boss, just one.

37:44.211 --> 37:46.281
One weapon, one shooter.

37:46.341 --> 37:48.141
That's good work.

37:48.211 --> 37:51.441
Tell DiNozzo I need
another search warrant.

37:59.511 --> 38:01.281
Agent Gibbs.

38:01.341 --> 38:03.911
Ah. Thanks for coming, Major.

38:03.981 --> 38:06.181
Have a sit.

38:06.241 --> 38:08.117
Came down to give you what I could.

38:08.141 --> 38:09.157
Their files are missing.

38:09.181 --> 38:11.341
Oh, I know where they are.

38:11.411 --> 38:12.941
You do?

38:13.011 --> 38:14.887
Lieutenant Shaheen's briefcase.

38:14.911 --> 38:16.881
You found it. Not yet.

38:16.941 --> 38:18.811
Bad luck.

38:18.881 --> 38:20.781
Not for you.

38:20.841 --> 38:22.941
I'm sorry?

38:23.011 --> 38:25.041
Operation Cauldron

38:25.111 --> 38:28.157
relocated three Iraqi men from
Baghdad to the United States

38:28.181 --> 38:29.157
after they supplied intelligence

38:29.181 --> 38:31.381
on the insurgency in Baghdad.

38:31.441 --> 38:32.641
That's right.

38:32.711 --> 38:34.917
Masoud Tariq gave you
first-class intelligence.

38:34.941 --> 38:37.487
In comparison, the other ones
gave you far less, Major Raines,

38:37.511 --> 38:38.817
but they still came to America.

38:38.841 --> 38:40.741
Lieutenant Shaheen...

38:40.841 --> 38:41.957
Wasn't investigating them.

38:41.981 --> 38:44.041
She was investigating you.

38:46.141 --> 38:48.057
How much did they pay you
for their new life in America?

38:48.081 --> 38:50.457
I don't know what you're
talking about, Agent Gibbs.

38:50.481 --> 38:53.417
For an intelligence officer,
you're not very intelligent.

38:53.441 --> 38:55.757
What's your license plate number?

38:55.781 --> 38:57.981
I drive a Pentagon car.

38:58.041 --> 38:59.957
Kilo-echo-four-
seven-one-three-nine.

38:59.981 --> 39:02.241
You signed it out last Friday.

39:02.311 --> 39:04.387
Masoud had suspicious neighbors

39:04.411 --> 39:07.041
looking for terrorists, found you.

39:07.111 --> 39:08.487
You followed Lieutenant Shaheen,

39:08.511 --> 39:11.457
parked the car down the street,
and waited while she met Masoud.

39:11.481 --> 39:13.211
Not very smart.

39:13.281 --> 39:14.996
Neither was killing her.

39:17.881 --> 39:20.081
All right, so I followed her.

39:20.141 --> 39:21.857
Because it was me investigating her.

39:21.881 --> 39:23.587
She's the one who got paid off.

39:23.611 --> 39:25.087
I didn't say anything

39:25.111 --> 39:27.417
because I didn't want her
name ruined after she was dead.

39:27.441 --> 39:29.041
Take off your gloves.

39:29.111 --> 39:31.781
- What?!
- Gloves! Off!

39:39.611 --> 39:41.787
I had a minor accident over the weekend.

39:41.811 --> 39:43.887
The barrel on your weapon exploded.

39:43.911 --> 39:45.257
Guess you tossed it in the river.

39:45.281 --> 39:48.611
You should have tossed your ammo, too.

39:48.681 --> 39:49.681
McGee.

39:52.011 --> 39:54.941
Found them in Major
Raines' garage, boss.

39:55.011 --> 39:56.257
Served the warrant to his wife.

39:56.281 --> 39:58.346
I hate it when that happens.

40:00.041 --> 40:02.641
What's that, sump oil?

40:02.711 --> 40:04.657
Well, I'm sure we'll be
able to tell you exactly

40:04.681 --> 40:08.996
after we match it to the casing
found at the murder scene.

40:09.511 --> 40:11.241
How much?

40:15.381 --> 40:16.941
How much?

40:20.141 --> 40:22.081
Half a million.

40:22.141 --> 40:23.257
Lieutenant Shaheen always suspected.

40:23.281 --> 40:24.457
It could've been anyone

40:24.481 --> 40:26.287
criminals, insurgents, Al-Qaeda.

40:26.311 --> 40:29.441
You think I didn't check them out?

40:29.511 --> 40:31.057
Just a couple of rich kids who wanted

40:31.081 --> 40:35.157
to get the hell out of there
and come party in America.

40:35.181 --> 40:37.117
Just rich kids, that's all.

40:37.141 --> 40:40.456
P.T. Lieutenant Shaheen
had to pay the price.

40:49.811 --> 40:51.887
Gibbs, about this morning...

40:51.911 --> 40:55.317
- Come on, are you starting this again?
- It's my Mossad training.

40:55.341 --> 40:57.387
They drummed it into us.
Push, push, push, push, push,

40:57.411 --> 40:59.657
push, push, never give up
until you get to the truth.

40:59.681 --> 41:01.957
Or get your ass kicked.

41:01.981 --> 41:04.241
Right.

41:05.381 --> 41:07.517
I thought you sent Tony
back because of his, um,

41:07.541 --> 41:09.711
illness.

41:09.781 --> 41:11.441
His illness?

41:11.511 --> 41:15.187
He has two cell phones, makes
furtive calls to a hospital,

41:15.211 --> 41:18.317
goes missing for hours, always
lies about where he's been.

41:18.341 --> 41:20.257
I mean, he doesn't even
talk about women anymore.

41:20.281 --> 41:22.541
The only logical explanation

41:22.611 --> 41:24.917
is that he's receiving
outpatient treatment

41:24.941 --> 41:27.911
for a serious medical problem.

41:27.981 --> 41:30.286
That's not the only explanation.

41:34.181 --> 41:35.111
You know,

41:35.181 --> 41:37.381
for a couple of rich kids,

41:37.441 --> 41:41.881
Asad and Youssef aren't
exactly living it up.

41:49.911 --> 41:51.857
Do you think they'll be deported?

41:51.881 --> 41:53.011
Yeah, probably.

41:54.211 --> 41:55.911
Youssef! Youssef!

42:07.941 --> 42:09.381
Turn around.

42:22.881 --> 42:24.081
Gibbs.

42:43.741 --> 42:46.881
How could I possibly believe all that?

42:46.941 --> 42:48.017
It's all true.

42:48.041 --> 42:49.311
The roses?

42:49.381 --> 42:50.311
True.

42:50.381 --> 42:52.881
Mm... the runaway horse?

42:52.941 --> 42:54.711
I still have the scars.

42:54.781 --> 42:56.111
Where?

42:56.181 --> 42:57.981
Okay.

43:00.981 --> 43:02.411
Right there.

43:03.841 --> 43:04.781
Yes.

43:04.841 --> 43:06.957
Shall I kiss it and make it better?

43:06.981 --> 43:09.017
You do whatever you
think is best, doctor.

43:09.041 --> 43:10.457
I'm not going to stop you from...

43:10.481 --> 43:12.617
This is illegal in some
Southern states, you know.

43:12.641 --> 43:14.811
Oh... pager.

43:15.981 --> 43:17.857
Well, just tell them you're performing

43:17.881 --> 43:19.357
a delicate emergency procedure

43:19.381 --> 43:20.587
and you'll call them back later.

43:20.611 --> 43:22.157
I couldn't do that to them.

43:22.181 --> 43:23.681
I could.

43:26.281 --> 43:31.011
You... did not just do that.

43:33.381 --> 43:34.132
You like it, don't you?

43:34.232 --> 43:35.888
Greedy.
