01:14.141 --> 01:15.474
[John]
<i>The door is closed.</i>

01:15.476 --> 01:18.277
[Young Sera] <i> A basic force</i>
<i>dynamic expression.</i>

01:18.279 --> 01:21.280
<i>The presence of two force
exerting elements.</i>

01:22.116 --> 01:23.615
<i>The expression,
"the door is closed"</i>

01:23.617 --> 01:25.284
<i>is force dynamically neutral.</i>

01:25.553 --> 01:26.585
[John] <i> Good.</i>

01:27.555 --> 01:29.088
The door cannot open.

01:29.223 --> 01:30.556
[Young Sera]
<i>There's a recognizable</i>

01:30.558 --> 01:32.224
<i>force dynamic pattern.</i>

01:32.393 --> 01:34.326
<i>The door has some tendencies
toward opening</i>

01:34.328 --> 01:36.228
<i>but there is another force</i>

01:36.230 --> 01:37.763
<i>preventing it
from being opened.</i>

01:38.833 --> 01:41.200
And what opens the door?

01:41.202 --> 01:42.734
[Young Sera]
<i>To open the door requires</i>

01:42.736 --> 01:44.436
<i>an opposing
dynamic force.</i>

01:44.438 --> 01:45.571
[John] Which is?

01:45.573 --> 01:46.772
[Young Sera]
<i>The antagonist.</i>

01:46.774 --> 01:49.341
<i>A force entity with
the intrinsic force tendency</i>

01:49.343 --> 01:50.576
<i>towards action.</i>

01:50.578 --> 01:52.511
Is the antagonist
always visible?

01:52.513 --> 01:54.396
[Young Sera] <i> No.</i>

01:54.397 --> 01:56.280
<i>A gust of wind made the pages
of my book turn.</i>

01:56.584 --> 01:58.550
Okay, now you're just
showing off.

02:01.188 --> 02:02.221
Sera.

02:03.457 --> 02:04.756
<i>Can it be opened?</i>

02:05.593 --> 02:06.792
[Young Sera] <i> Yes.</i>

02:10.431 --> 02:12.164
What opens the door?

02:13.567 --> 02:14.766
[Young Sera] <i> Afraid.</i>

02:15.736 --> 02:17.136
[John]
<i>Sera, what do you see?</i>

02:17.638 --> 02:19.438
- [Young Sera] <i> People.</i>
- [man screams]

02:20.207 --> 02:21.473
<i>They're screaming.</i>

02:22.276 --> 02:23.675
Sera, who's screaming?

02:24.845 --> 02:26.245
- [Young Sera] <i> Everyone.</i>
- [screams]

02:26.447 --> 02:27.679
[gasps]

02:27.681 --> 02:28.914
Shut it down.

02:30.918 --> 02:32.284
Shut it down!

02:33.220 --> 02:36.722
[machine whirring slowing]

03:55.469 --> 03:56.735
[squelching]

03:57.438 --> 04:00.272
[Zack] Jesus, baby,
don't you ever get tired?

04:05.579 --> 04:06.979
What the...

04:07.815 --> 04:09.348
[Zack] Where am I?

04:12.920 --> 04:14.519
[squelching]

04:16.724 --> 04:18.890
[whooshing]

04:21.894 --> 04:24.496
[grunts]

04:24.498 --> 04:26.265
[Zack] Son of a bitch!

04:29.003 --> 04:31.536
Fuck. [whimpering]

04:32.006 --> 04:33.672
[whooshing]

04:36.443 --> 04:37.876
Who the fuck are you?

04:38.746 --> 04:39.845
[groans]

04:41.515 --> 04:44.349
Hey! I'm talking to you!

04:44.351 --> 04:46.818
- [indistinct chatter]
- [electricity surging]

04:48.622 --> 04:50.656
Well, would you say
something for fuck sake?

04:54.762 --> 04:55.761
Fuck.

04:55.763 --> 04:59.431
Oh, fuck, oh, fuck,
oh, fuck, oh, fuck, oh, fuck.

05:00.367 --> 05:02.434
[Zack] Oh, just calm down.

05:03.504 --> 05:07.039
This isn't real.
This isn't real, it can't be.

05:07.908 --> 05:09.574
No, it's just a dream.

05:10.311 --> 05:11.610
Just a very...

05:12.379 --> 05:13.478
bad...

05:13.981 --> 05:15.080
dream.

05:15.516 --> 05:18.383
[breathing heavily]

05:20.454 --> 05:21.553
[whooshing]

05:21.922 --> 05:23.088
[grunts]

05:39.773 --> 05:40.972
[assistant] General.

05:44.411 --> 05:46.378
We've lost
Sera's transmission, sir.

05:49.683 --> 05:50.749
Damn.

05:52.619 --> 05:54.786
Well, I guess that's that.

05:57.624 --> 05:59.391
Thank you.
You're dismissed.

05:59.693 --> 06:02.694
Sir, we've actually received
a second transmission...

06:03.397 --> 06:04.896
coming from the same location.

06:05.065 --> 06:07.032
They're waiting for you
down in science.

06:08.969 --> 06:10.702
Tell them I'm on my way.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.571
Will do. One more thing, sir.

06:13.507 --> 06:15.974
Agent Brighton has disappeared.

06:18.846 --> 06:19.845
Shit.

06:33.627 --> 06:34.826
[Zack] Hello?

06:36.730 --> 06:37.996
[woman sobbing]

06:37.998 --> 06:39.531
[Zack] Hello?

06:42.603 --> 06:44.536
[Zack] So, are you gonna
at least say something?

06:45.072 --> 06:47.072
[woman whimpering]

06:52.579 --> 06:54.413
[Zack] Can you at least
tell me your name?

06:55.015 --> 06:55.847
Sera.

06:59.853 --> 07:00.919
[grunts]

07:01.822 --> 07:03.422
[whooshing]

07:05.426 --> 07:06.925
This wasn't part of the plan.

07:13.634 --> 07:15.167
Who the hell are you?

07:20.541 --> 07:21.506
John.

07:22.042 --> 07:23.208
[Zack] I'm Zack.

07:24.178 --> 07:25.444
Sera.

07:25.913 --> 07:27.512
Sera, do you know who I am?

07:34.721 --> 07:36.888
[electricity surging]

07:37.624 --> 07:38.623
[John] <i> Sera, it's me.</i>

07:41.028 --> 07:42.561
It's Agent Brighton.

07:43.664 --> 07:44.663
[John] The door.

07:46.900 --> 07:48.066
Is it open?

07:56.176 --> 07:57.876
Something about this
isn't right.

08:00.814 --> 08:03.148
Why send her up incognizant.
It doesn't make sense.

08:04.518 --> 08:05.617
Unless...

08:06.887 --> 08:08.687
Zack, have they made contact?

08:08.689 --> 08:09.888
What? No.

08:10.057 --> 08:12.023
It could indicate
a remote interface.

08:12.559 --> 08:13.925
[John] No, no,
that doesn't follow,

08:13.927 --> 08:15.760
the interface
requires a hardwire.

08:17.965 --> 08:19.598
[whooshing]

08:20.100 --> 08:21.566
[Zack moans]
Call me Zack Chase.

08:21.568 --> 08:23.034
- [woman moans] Zack Chase.
- [Zack] Yeah.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.036
[both moaning]

08:25.172 --> 08:28.240
[rock music playing on radio]

08:37.618 --> 08:38.817
Mm.

08:39.586 --> 08:41.720
Devil got you good.
[chuckles]

08:43.590 --> 08:46.858
Amber, you classy gal.
[chuckles]

08:47.594 --> 08:49.127
I'm your classy gal.

08:50.964 --> 08:53.064
[groans]

08:55.035 --> 08:56.301
What's happening to her?

08:58.305 --> 09:00.272
[Sera groans]

09:00.641 --> 09:02.073
Devil got you good.

09:03.744 --> 09:04.943
What did she say?

09:04.945 --> 09:08.013
- Sera, can you understand me?
- Uh, how'd she do that?

09:08.015 --> 09:11.016
- [John] Do what?
- I'm your classy gal!

09:11.018 --> 09:12.617
- That!
- Sera.

09:12.619 --> 09:13.952
I wanna know how she did that!

09:13.954 --> 09:15.020
Zack, calm down.

09:15.022 --> 09:16.154
[Zack] Calm down?

09:16.156 --> 09:18.189
Don't tell me
to fuckin' calm down!

09:18.625 --> 09:20.792
Hey! I'm talkin' to you!

09:20.794 --> 09:23.028
- God. Let me out.
- [whooshing]

09:23.030 --> 09:25.063
[Rhonda] Let me out. Let me out!

09:26.767 --> 09:28.033
[Rhonda gasps]

09:28.035 --> 09:30.268
Let me out, let me out,
let me out!

09:30.270 --> 09:31.836
[whooshing]

09:32.906 --> 09:34.773
Let me out, let me out,

09:34.775 --> 09:36.141
- let me out!
- Miss, listen to me.

09:36.276 --> 09:37.776
You have to remain calm.

09:37.778 --> 09:40.612
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God! [gasps]

09:41.048 --> 09:42.914
Let me out,
let me out, let me out!

09:42.916 --> 09:45.650
Lady, please, you're just--
You're making it worse, okay?

09:45.652 --> 09:46.918
Too late, she's flooding.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.153
What the hell is flooding?

09:48.722 --> 09:51.289
Let me out, let me out,
let me out!

09:51.291 --> 09:52.724
- That.
- [whooshing]

09:53.193 --> 09:54.326
[gasps]

09:54.928 --> 09:56.728
- [electricity surges]
- [whooshing]

09:57.197 --> 09:59.331
Lady, please,
just you gotta listen to--

09:59.333 --> 10:01.232
No. Let it happen.

10:01.234 --> 10:02.667
Let what happen?

10:02.669 --> 10:03.735
[gasps]

10:03.737 --> 10:04.869
[John] Good.

10:06.340 --> 10:08.073
- That's good.
- Good?

10:08.075 --> 10:09.674
How can that be good?

10:09.676 --> 10:11.743
Lady, please, just listen to me,
all right?

10:11.745 --> 10:13.328
Just trust me on this one.

10:13.329 --> 10:14.912
What part of let it happen
didn't you understand?

10:17.918 --> 10:18.883
That's it.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.654
That's it, come on.

10:30.030 --> 10:32.097
[whooshing]

10:32.099 --> 10:33.298
Attagirl.

10:34.334 --> 10:35.967
Are you outta
your fucking mind?

10:35.969 --> 10:37.135
Now, you listen to me.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.421
Unconscious is a hell
of a lot better than dead.

10:39.422 --> 10:41.706
A few seconds more
and her spine would have snapped

10:41.708 --> 10:43.041
like a pencil, you got that?

10:43.377 --> 10:45.877
Now, shut up,
and let me think, goddammit.

10:46.647 --> 10:49.414
Sera, I don't know
what they've done to you,

10:49.416 --> 10:52.117
but if you're inside this thing,
I need you to open the door.

10:52.119 --> 10:54.386
What the fuck is going on?

10:54.388 --> 10:56.655
Goddammit, Sera,
open the door!

10:59.993 --> 11:02.027
[Borland]
<i>I don't understand, Doctor.</i>

11:02.029 --> 11:05.263
I need you
to explain it to me. When?

11:05.265 --> 11:07.332
I don't know.
Just before he left.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.267
That was, what,
ten years ago?

11:18.879 --> 11:20.211
Dammit, John.

11:23.717 --> 11:24.883
How does it work?

11:25.018 --> 11:27.886
Sera's transponder
generates a stabilized

11:27.888 --> 11:30.689
density matrix that sends
a pulse over to John's,

11:30.691 --> 11:32.290
telling it to generate
the same frequency.

11:32.292 --> 11:34.225
Because they share
a confluent timeline,

11:34.227 --> 11:35.794
even from variable
reference points,

11:35.796 --> 11:37.896
they both could draw
into the same quantum subsystem.

11:37.898 --> 11:40.765
[chuckles]
It's pretty, uh, groovy, huh?

11:44.771 --> 11:47.872
So you're saying
that they arrived together.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.475
We set a radial distance
of twelve and a half feet,

11:50.477 --> 11:52.310
so, yeah.

11:52.312 --> 11:54.312
I don't understand,

11:54.313 --> 11:56.313
why did it take so long
to pick up his signal?

11:56.316 --> 11:58.750
She's been gone
for more than 48 hours.

11:58.752 --> 12:01.286
But the transmissions
were in phase, sir.

12:01.288 --> 12:03.321
It wasn't until the frequency
dropped an amplitude

12:03.323 --> 12:05.223
that we even realized
that there were two.

12:05.225 --> 12:08.727
I mean, it's been ten years,
and to be honest,

12:08.729 --> 12:09.994
I wasn't even sure
it was gonna work.

12:09.996 --> 12:11.930
Back engineering
isn't an exact science,

12:11.932 --> 12:13.998
especially with technology
this advanced.

12:15.035 --> 12:16.735
It's ironic, I know.

12:19.306 --> 12:20.872
Keep me posted.

12:23.944 --> 12:25.944
Goddammit, John.

12:27.481 --> 12:30.281
What the hell
have you gotten yourself into?

12:31.518 --> 12:33.752
[John] Sera, I don't know
what they've done to you,

12:33.754 --> 12:36.321
but if you're inside this thing
I need you to open the door.

12:37.824 --> 12:39.190
[John] What do they want, Sera?

12:39.993 --> 12:41.159
Why are they here?

12:41.962 --> 12:43.495
It's obvious
they need something from us

12:43.497 --> 12:45.063
otherwise we'd already be dead.

12:45.065 --> 12:46.297
[Zack] What the fuck?

12:47.901 --> 12:49.167
[Perry] Wallace!

12:49.169 --> 12:50.869
[John] I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

12:52.339 --> 12:53.772
You're only making it worse.

12:54.441 --> 12:57.308
Yeah?
And who the fuck are you?

12:58.011 --> 12:59.177
My name's John.

12:59.179 --> 13:01.913
Well, John,
when I want your opinion,

13:02.048 --> 13:04.115
I'll give it to ya! Yeah?

13:05.786 --> 13:08.052
Fuck. Fuck.

13:08.221 --> 13:09.354
[grunts]

13:09.823 --> 13:10.889
Bugger.

13:11.558 --> 13:12.857
Shit!

13:12.993 --> 13:14.192
What the hell are these things?

13:14.194 --> 13:15.927
Perhaps you'd like
to give me my opinion?

13:17.964 --> 13:19.497
It's an auto-response mechanism.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.966
So if you like the idea
of spending the last few minutes

13:21.968 --> 13:23.468
of your life
minus your extremities,

13:23.470 --> 13:25.236
by all means,
keep doing what you're doing.

13:25.238 --> 13:26.371
- You what?
- [John] Of course,

13:26.373 --> 13:28.373
it all depends on how long
it takes for you to bleed out,

13:28.374 --> 13:30.374
and my guess is
you've got high blood pressure,

13:30.377 --> 13:31.943
not to mention
all that straining.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.512
Anyway, its fine by me.

13:34.514 --> 13:35.864
You've barely
been awake a minute

13:35.865 --> 13:37.215
and you're already
giving me a headache.

13:37.217 --> 13:38.216
[chuckles]

13:40.020 --> 13:41.119
Who's the poofter?

13:41.321 --> 13:42.987
The name's Zack, asshole.

13:42.989 --> 13:44.389
Oh, is there a difference?

13:52.833 --> 13:54.499
So, where the fuck are we, lads?

13:55.502 --> 13:58.102
Don't look like no shovel
and pick I've ever seen.

13:58.271 --> 14:00.071
Yeah, I'll bet
you've seen a few.

14:01.942 --> 14:03.374
As a matter of fact I have.

14:04.177 --> 14:06.978
Busted out of half as many
I've been in, pleased to say.

14:06.980 --> 14:08.213
[John] Let's start again.

14:09.049 --> 14:11.516
My name is John.
You are?

14:13.453 --> 14:14.753
Perry.

14:14.754 --> 14:16.054
What's the last thing
you remember?

14:16.489 --> 14:17.622
I don't know.

14:19.259 --> 14:20.859
Pukin' my guts out I reckon.

14:22.429 --> 14:23.995
- [banging]
- Guard!

14:25.465 --> 14:27.098
[Perry gasping]
Did you bring the doc?

14:29.603 --> 14:31.002
[doctor] Mr. Bulmer.

14:31.004 --> 14:32.237
[Perry] You gotta help me, Doc.

14:33.039 --> 14:34.906
[groans]
My guts feel rotten.

14:34.908 --> 14:36.875
[doctor] Open your mouth,
please, Mr. Bulmer.

14:39.145 --> 14:40.311
[wretches]

14:42.949 --> 14:44.148
[John] <i>I was sick as well.</i>

14:44.517 --> 14:46.885
Clearly a side effect
of transport.

14:46.887 --> 14:49.520
Transport?
What do you mean transport?

14:49.522 --> 14:52.223
It means this is some
right fine magic.

14:53.260 --> 14:55.460
Right, magic. Hilarious.

14:56.630 --> 14:58.029
Roger that.

14:58.365 --> 15:01.032
Of the extra-terrestrial
variety.

15:02.469 --> 15:03.568
Okay.

15:03.570 --> 15:07.238
Everyone who agrees
with Dumbledore over here,

15:07.240 --> 15:08.373
raise your hand.

15:08.675 --> 15:10.642
[Zack] Huh? Anyone?

15:11.411 --> 15:12.543
Anyone?

15:12.545 --> 15:14.178
Take a good look around.

15:14.581 --> 15:17.015
You find me one single thing

15:17.150 --> 15:19.183
that looks like something
we could've built.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.287
[Perry] You see, my old man was
in tool and die

15:22.289 --> 15:24.022
for near 50 years.

15:24.024 --> 15:25.456
So I know machines.

15:25.458 --> 15:28.026
I know machines as well
as I know thieving', boy.

15:28.028 --> 15:30.461
And believe me,
I know thieving'.

15:31.698 --> 15:35.233
One man's magic
is another man's genius,

15:35.235 --> 15:38.069
and I ain't never seen
no genius like this.

15:39.205 --> 15:40.338
So...

15:40.340 --> 15:45.343
if it ain't built by man
and you don't believe in magic,

15:45.712 --> 15:48.212
then something else
must have built it.

15:48.548 --> 15:50.081
Come on, dude.

15:50.083 --> 15:53.584
What, you're saying we've been
abducted by, like, aliens?

15:53.586 --> 15:57.121
Nah, nah, don't be daft.
Pygmies.

15:57.524 --> 16:00.525
You fucking twat,
of course, fucking aliens.

16:01.261 --> 16:02.593
Jesus Christ,

16:02.595 --> 16:04.562
I think the transporter's
leaving brains behind.

16:04.564 --> 16:06.397
We've know about them
for some time,

16:06.399 --> 16:09.567
but why they're here
and what they want,

16:10.370 --> 16:12.303
I'm afraid that's still
part of the mystery.

16:12.439 --> 16:13.705
Well, now,

16:13.707 --> 16:17.108
I knew there was more to you
than meets the eye, Johnny boy.

16:18.178 --> 16:20.511
What? You think
I was born orange?

16:21.648 --> 16:25.416
There was a time
when certain organizations

16:25.418 --> 16:28.653
found my particular
set of skills quite useful.

16:31.057 --> 16:33.191
[Perry] I worked with lots
of blokes like you, Johnny boy.

16:34.627 --> 16:37.161
If I was blind,
I could smell ya.

16:37.163 --> 16:38.329
[sniffs]

16:38.331 --> 16:40.498
Hmm. So, what's your poison?

16:40.767 --> 16:42.667
CIA? NSA?

16:43.737 --> 16:45.136
FBI?

16:47.540 --> 16:48.706
Defense.

16:50.543 --> 16:51.642
[Zack] So...

16:53.013 --> 16:54.545
how long they been
doing this?

16:55.615 --> 16:56.748
Taking people?

16:57.350 --> 16:58.683
We believe a long time.

16:59.519 --> 17:01.552
My team allocated
considerable resources

17:01.554 --> 17:03.588
into tracking
bona fide abductees.

17:04.424 --> 17:05.589
Wasn't easy.

17:06.393 --> 17:08.226
People go missing
all the time.

17:08.228 --> 17:11.561
Fuck. Shit, this is--
This is like <i> Fire in the Sky!</i>

17:17.270 --> 17:18.435
D.B. Sweeney?

17:19.472 --> 17:21.239
[Zack] He got home okay.

17:21.674 --> 17:23.107
That's good, right?

17:24.544 --> 17:26.577
Though they did
fuck him up first.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.000
That's not so good.

17:32.001 --> 17:33.284
We thought, if we could
isolate commonalities,

17:33.286 --> 17:35.586
that might help us understand
what we're dealing with...

17:36.689 --> 17:38.256
help us to stop it.

17:39.793 --> 17:43.494
Okay, so, what,
we're talking, like,

17:44.130 --> 17:46.330
little green men here, right?

17:47.400 --> 17:48.599
They're not green.

17:49.702 --> 17:51.369
And they're definitely
not little.

17:55.075 --> 17:58.342
[gasps, screams]
No!

17:58.344 --> 17:59.410
[whooshing]

17:59.412 --> 18:01.212
Miss, it's incredibly important

18:01.214 --> 18:03.281
that you listen to me
and remain calm.

18:03.283 --> 18:04.582
I can't.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.184
Miss, I know you're afraid,

18:06.186 --> 18:07.652
but if you do exactly
as I say,

18:07.654 --> 18:09.620
we can get through this,
do you understand?

18:10.557 --> 18:11.656
Good.

18:12.192 --> 18:13.724
Now, I want you
to close your eyes.

18:13.726 --> 18:15.476
I'm claustrophobic!

18:15.477 --> 18:17.227
Miss, I need you to trust me,
close your eyes.

18:22.102 --> 18:24.702
My name's John.
What's yours?

18:25.305 --> 18:27.138
- Rhonda.
- [John] Rhonda, I want you

18:27.140 --> 18:28.406
to take a deep breath.

18:28.675 --> 18:30.775
And release it slowly,
you understand?

18:31.277 --> 18:32.844
[takes deep breath]

18:33.279 --> 18:34.278
Good.

18:35.148 --> 18:36.314
That's good.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.620
- [whooshing]
- [Rhonda] No, no, no, please.

18:42.622 --> 18:43.888
- Rhonda.
- [Rhonda] Please let me out.

18:43.890 --> 18:46.390
[Perry] Rhonda, love.
Listen to me.

18:47.494 --> 18:49.827
I know
what you're going through.

18:50.263 --> 18:51.529
Believe me, I do.

18:53.199 --> 18:54.899
I've spent a lot of years
in cells

18:54.901 --> 18:59.137
not much bigger than myself,
so I understand, all right?

18:59.806 --> 19:01.672
But you've got to calm down.

19:02.575 --> 19:05.276
We all want to get out of here
alive, now, don't we?

19:05.545 --> 19:06.677
Yeah?

19:07.614 --> 19:10.548
You need to close your eyes
and breathe.

19:10.917 --> 19:13.651
Come on, now,
trust me on this one, love.

19:16.156 --> 19:17.288
All right.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.624
Now, I want you to imagine

19:20.226 --> 19:23.161
your most favorite place
in the whole wide world.

19:23.530 --> 19:27.331
Maybe it's a real place,
maybe it's not,

19:27.333 --> 19:29.634
maybe it's a little spot
you got tucked away

19:29.636 --> 19:31.603
in the back of your mind.

19:31.604 --> 19:33.571
But either way, and this is
the important thing, Rhonda,

19:34.574 --> 19:37.875
this place is yours
and yours only.

19:37.877 --> 19:39.377
And when you're there,

19:39.546 --> 19:42.513
you're completely
and utterly safe.

19:44.651 --> 19:47.552
No one and no thing
can ever get ya.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.321
It's your safe place.

19:51.357 --> 19:54.292
Everything else
just disappears.

19:56.529 --> 19:57.862
[Perry] You got that place now?

19:58.498 --> 19:59.497
[Perry] Good girl.

20:00.500 --> 20:01.899
Now, if you don't mind,

20:02.569 --> 20:05.269
I fancy carrying on talking.
[chuckles]

20:05.271 --> 20:07.338
- Is that all right with you?
- Mm.

20:08.641 --> 20:11.442
So what's a lovely girl like you
do for a living, Rhonda?

20:12.278 --> 20:13.678
I'm-- I'm a teacher.

20:13.680 --> 20:15.346
- [Perry] You don't say.
- Mm.

20:15.548 --> 20:18.449
My mom was
a primary school teacher

20:18.451 --> 20:19.784
in South East London.

20:19.786 --> 20:21.786
Fucking tough gig that, eh?
[chuckles]

20:22.288 --> 20:24.689
- High school.
- Oh, Jesus.

20:25.458 --> 20:27.458
You deserve a king's
commendation for bravery

20:27.460 --> 20:29.393
- for that, don't ya? [chuckles]
- [laughing]

20:30.663 --> 20:32.363
What about yourself, love?

20:32.565 --> 20:34.365
You got any little'uns
of your own?

20:34.867 --> 20:36.000
A little girl.

20:37.337 --> 20:40.004
Hannah. She's eight.

20:40.006 --> 20:41.906
Ah, that's a lovely age, innit?

20:42.542 --> 20:44.909
- They still need ya at eight?
- [Rhonda] Mm.

20:46.980 --> 20:50.648
My oldest is, uh,
nineteen now.

20:54.487 --> 20:57.955
When the blokes start coming,
it's a different story, innit?

20:57.957 --> 20:58.956
[Rhonda chuckles]

21:00.927 --> 21:02.393
Anyway...

21:03.730 --> 21:05.563
in a couple of seconds,

21:05.565 --> 21:08.633
I'm going to ask you
to open your eyes, all right,

21:08.635 --> 21:11.902
but you've got to be able
to create a strong tether

21:12.405 --> 21:13.938
to that place in your mind.

21:14.641 --> 21:16.507
Because whatever happens here,

21:16.509 --> 21:18.576
you need to be able
to get back there

21:18.745 --> 21:20.678
as quick as you can,
you understand?

21:21.614 --> 21:22.680
All right.

21:23.883 --> 21:26.350
Go on then.
Open your eyes.

21:28.921 --> 21:31.322
All right, keep looking at me,
I'm right here.

21:31.691 --> 21:32.790
All right?

21:33.593 --> 21:34.659
There you go.

21:36.062 --> 21:37.695
All right, now, listen,

21:38.431 --> 21:40.464
I reckon we're a long way
from home,

21:40.466 --> 21:42.667
but I promise you
we are gonna get back.

21:43.803 --> 21:45.903
But you got to keep strong.

21:46.572 --> 21:48.005
Keep your wits about ya.

21:48.675 --> 21:50.374
Yeah, you think
you can do that?

21:52.478 --> 21:53.944
[whooshing]

21:57.016 --> 21:59.583
Okay. Now, the first thing
we need to figure out

22:00.053 --> 22:01.786
is what's the
common denominator.

22:02.555 --> 22:03.654
Why us?

22:03.656 --> 22:06.757
Well, maybe we're just lucky.

22:07.927 --> 22:09.827
Rhonda, what's the last thing
you remember?

22:10.063 --> 22:12.596
I-- I-- I don't know. I...

22:15.802 --> 22:19.603
[sighs]
No. Wait.

22:20.073 --> 22:23.541
I... I was on my way to work

22:23.543 --> 22:27.478
and I just dropped off
Hannah at school,

22:27.814 --> 22:30.047
and I started to feel nauseous,

22:30.049 --> 22:33.551
and I felt this
really horrible pain,

22:33.953 --> 22:35.653
then here.

22:35.655 --> 22:37.121
[squelching]

22:37.590 --> 22:39.090
[Rhonda] But how
is that possible?

22:39.092 --> 22:41.359
[Alex groans]

22:42.495 --> 22:44.462
[whooshing]

22:44.897 --> 22:45.930
Jacques!

22:46.132 --> 22:47.431
Jacques!

22:47.700 --> 22:49.066
Miss, listen to me.

22:49.702 --> 22:51.369
[speaking French]

22:52.638 --> 22:53.971
[whooshing]

23:19.465 --> 23:20.731
[knocks]

23:32.044 --> 23:33.177
[speaking French]

23:47.894 --> 23:50.694
- [bed squeaking]
- [man grunts]

23:52.999 --> 23:54.598
[knocking on door]

24:00.573 --> 24:01.839
[man]

24:07.180 --> 24:10.047
[Jacques]

24:10.917 --> 24:13.551
[man]

24:13.786 --> 24:15.519
[indistinct arguing]

24:19.959 --> 24:21.192
[Alex grunts]

24:21.794 --> 24:22.860
[speaking English] Miss!

24:23.062 --> 24:24.195
Jacques!

24:24.197 --> 24:28.866
[speaking French]

24:29.669 --> 24:33.571
[Rhonda speaking French]

24:34.807 --> 24:36.106
[speaking English]
We're all alone.

24:37.977 --> 24:40.144
[whooshing]

24:41.481 --> 24:43.514
[speaking French]

25:05.004 --> 25:06.103
Alex.

25:09.642 --> 25:12.676
[breathing heavily]

25:15.848 --> 25:17.581
[speaking English]
What are these things?

25:17.583 --> 25:18.916
They're auto-responsive.

25:19.585 --> 25:20.851
I don't understand.

25:20.853 --> 25:22.186
What he's trying to say, love,

25:22.188 --> 25:24.255
is if you struggle,
it'll rip your arms off.

25:25.124 --> 25:26.824
Subtle. Nice.

25:27.727 --> 25:29.293
Who the fuck are you?

25:29.295 --> 25:31.595
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm Father Christmas,

25:31.597 --> 25:32.830
these are me elves.

25:32.832 --> 25:34.164
Oh, and that one there...

25:34.834 --> 25:36.634
[whispering]
He wants to be a dentist.

25:36.769 --> 25:37.801
Fuck you.

25:41.173 --> 25:42.273
I know you.

25:42.275 --> 25:43.741
[John] Zack,
you know this woman?

25:43.743 --> 25:46.076
Know her?
How would I know her?

25:46.078 --> 25:48.045
She just said she knew you.

25:48.047 --> 25:49.747
[Zack] Yeah,
so what's your point?

25:49.749 --> 25:51.749
Oh, shit.
You're Zack Chase.

25:51.751 --> 25:52.950
Zack, what's going on?

25:52.952 --> 25:56.787
Look, it's just the way
it is, all right?

25:56.789 --> 25:58.889
Just because somebody says
they know me,

25:58.891 --> 26:00.591
it doesn't mean they know me.

26:07.066 --> 26:08.265
Wait a minute.

26:09.769 --> 26:13.137
You have absolutely
no idea who I am,

26:14.040 --> 26:15.139
do you?

26:15.141 --> 26:16.674
[laughs]

26:16.676 --> 26:19.109
Uh, Zack Chase.

26:21.047 --> 26:22.580
[Zack] Mossy Ledge?

26:24.784 --> 26:25.983
It's a band.

26:26.319 --> 26:27.885
[chuckles]
Don't look at me, mate.

26:27.887 --> 26:29.853
Do I look like I do boy bands?

26:29.855 --> 26:31.188
It's a rock band, you shithead!

26:31.190 --> 26:34.291
You were a famous popstar
when I was little.

26:34.293 --> 26:36.994
Rockstar, and what do you mean
when you were little?

26:38.864 --> 26:39.964
You died.

26:39.966 --> 26:42.333
[Zack] Okay, yeah,
and you're obviously still high.

26:42.335 --> 26:43.767
I'm not fucking high!

26:43.769 --> 26:46.103
- Do I look dead to you?
- Hey, get off my ass,

26:46.105 --> 26:48.205
I'm just saying
what I know, okay?

26:49.008 --> 26:50.808
- When a big popstar...
- Rockstar!

26:50.810 --> 26:52.743
...gets murdered
by his fiancée,

26:52.745 --> 26:55.212
uh, people talk about it!

26:55.214 --> 26:57.348
What the fuck
are you talking about, murdered?

26:58.117 --> 27:00.084
It was all over the news.

27:00.286 --> 27:03.253
I was just a kid,
but I remember my sister

27:03.255 --> 27:05.356
really loving your shit.
[chuckles]

27:07.326 --> 27:09.293
Anyway, it was a big trial,

27:09.829 --> 27:11.862
your fiancée
was found guilty

27:11.864 --> 27:13.831
and they put her in jail
for life.

27:14.000 --> 27:15.065
Amber.

27:15.067 --> 27:17.267
She made up
some bullshit story

27:17.269 --> 27:20.838
about you disappearing
in a big flash of light.

27:20.840 --> 27:21.905
[laughs]

27:22.108 --> 27:24.074
You had to be fucking crazy

27:24.310 --> 27:26.744
to think anyone
is going to believe that shit.

27:27.880 --> 27:30.648
Anyway,
they never found the body.

27:31.250 --> 27:33.951
Yeah, well, obviously
there was no body.

27:33.953 --> 27:35.653
Alex, how long ago was this?

27:36.288 --> 27:37.855
I don't know, uh...

27:38.691 --> 27:40.124
Maybe fifteen years.

27:40.126 --> 27:42.192
- Cut the bullshit!
- Alex, what year is it?

27:43.429 --> 27:44.928
[chuckles]
Really?

27:51.103 --> 27:53.871
Alex, the year.

27:56.142 --> 27:57.441
2018.

28:00.212 --> 28:04.014
See? What'd I tell ya?
Out of her fucking mind.

28:04.016 --> 28:07.051
I'm not an idiot, asshole,
I know what year it is.

28:07.053 --> 28:08.252
Here's a little tip.

28:09.288 --> 28:10.954
Lay off the scag.

28:11.991 --> 28:15.025
Oh, and Alice Cooper called,
he wants his makeup back.

28:16.262 --> 28:18.962
[speaking French]

28:24.303 --> 28:25.369
[speaking English]
What?

28:25.371 --> 28:29.039
Well, for starters, love,
you're about thirty years out.

28:29.041 --> 28:31.875
[chuckles]
What are you talking about?

28:32.211 --> 28:33.711
It's 2050, innit?

28:34.914 --> 28:36.380
Right.
[chuckles]

28:36.382 --> 28:38.415
Okay, seriously,
is everyone losing their minds?

28:38.751 --> 28:40.050
Why, what did I say?

28:40.820 --> 28:42.886
- It's 2001!
- Bugger off.

28:43.155 --> 28:46.290
That's not possible, it's 1977.

28:46.492 --> 28:49.493
Okay.
You guys, this isn't funny.

28:50.129 --> 28:52.129
John, c'mon,
tell em' what year it is.

28:54.366 --> 28:55.866
1969.

28:56.769 --> 28:58.068
Oh, and we're fucked.

28:58.370 --> 29:00.204
It's gonna get a lot worse

29:00.406 --> 29:03.006
Really?
And just how could it get

29:03.008 --> 29:04.441
any worse than this?

29:05.177 --> 29:07.077
[growling]

29:11.083 --> 29:12.149
Fuck.

29:12.818 --> 29:15.018
Oh, fuck, it's worse.

29:19.024 --> 29:21.024
[whooshing]

29:22.428 --> 29:23.827
John.

29:37.243 --> 29:38.375
John!

30:00.432 --> 30:03.934
No! No! No! No! No!

30:04.136 --> 30:06.436
- [muffled screaming]
- [whooshing]

30:30.396 --> 30:32.896
Shh.

30:33.032 --> 30:37.034
[Christmas music
plays over radio]

30:49.148 --> 30:50.113
[chuckles]

30:51.217 --> 30:52.549
[Rhonda] What is this?

30:54.353 --> 30:57.988
H-- How-- How is this possible?

30:59.592 --> 31:01.024
Safe place.

31:02.261 --> 31:03.460
[Rhonda gasps]

31:03.996 --> 31:05.529
[Zack] What's it doing to her?

31:06.432 --> 31:08.198
Is she breathing in that thing?

31:19.478 --> 31:20.978
[Rhonda] It's me.

31:24.216 --> 31:25.349
Gran?

31:27.286 --> 31:30.420
[wheezing]

31:31.523 --> 31:32.990

31:33.359 --> 31:34.591
Rhonda.

31:35.527 --> 31:37.027
African.

31:38.230 --> 31:39.429
Female.

31:40.332 --> 31:42.900
Offspring, one.

31:43.636 --> 31:46.403
Slight abnormality
in the right atria.

31:47.640 --> 31:54.244
You have functioned for
12,589 days.

31:56.048 --> 31:59.082
Soon,
you will cease to function.

32:03.188 --> 32:05.188
[voice distorts]
You don't belong here.

32:05.391 --> 32:06.690
[gasps]

32:11.163 --> 32:13.463
Whoever you are, please,

32:13.666 --> 32:15.399
I have to get home
for my daughter,

32:17.703 --> 32:19.470
she'll be waiting for me.

32:19.471 --> 32:21.238
I'm afraid you won't
be seeing Hannah again, dear.

32:21.440 --> 32:25.575
Please, I have to go home.
I can't leave my little girl.

32:26.078 --> 32:27.344
No, please.

32:28.047 --> 32:30.213
I have to go home,
she'll be waiting for me.

32:32.418 --> 32:35.118
Please, whoever you are,
I'm begging you, please.

32:35.120 --> 32:36.253
Let me out.

32:39.091 --> 32:40.357
Goodbye.

32:52.538 --> 32:55.472

No, no, no, no.

32:55.641 --> 32:58.075
Please. Please.

33:00.479 --> 33:01.645
[screams]

33:02.348 --> 33:04.214
Sera, what do you see?

33:08.587 --> 33:10.053
[Young Sera] <i> People.</i>

33:10.055 --> 33:11.321
What people?

33:12.391 --> 33:13.991
[Young Sera]
<i>They're screaming.</i>

33:14.626 --> 33:16.193
Sera, who's screaming?

33:16.562 --> 33:17.594
[Young Sera] <i> Everyone.</i>

[muffled screams]

33:25.404 --> 33:26.570
Shut it down.

33:27.773 --> 33:29.139
Shut it down!

33:30.509 --> 33:32.175
[gasps]

33:41.086 --> 33:43.120
Come on, Sera,
stay with me.

33:44.490 --> 33:45.689
Stay with me!

33:46.658 --> 33:48.091
[gasps]

33:50.562 --> 33:51.762
They're coming.

33:55.434 --> 33:58.568
[screaming]

34:08.781 --> 34:10.047
Fuck me.

34:17.723 --> 34:23.393
What... the... fuck!

34:25.197 --> 34:26.530
[Zack screams]

34:32.670 --> 34:35.138
What the fuck
was that thing, Johnny boy?

34:36.507 --> 34:38.175
I honestly don't know.

34:39.143 --> 34:41.411
[speaking French]

34:41.413 --> 34:42.712
[whooshing]

34:42.848 --> 34:44.681
[screams]

34:47.085 --> 34:48.351

Alex, listen to me.

34:48.353 --> 34:49.553
[screams]

34:49.554 --> 34:51.755
[speaking French]

34:59.565 --> 35:00.864
[speaking English]
Alex, look!

35:02.301 --> 35:04.501
Look around you! Look!

35:10.843 --> 35:12.209
It's fear.

35:15.581 --> 35:16.646
Fear?

35:17.449 --> 35:18.515
[John] Yes.

35:19.651 --> 35:21.618
I think it's harnessing energy.

35:23.822 --> 35:28.725
[speaking French]

35:34.333 --> 35:36.833
[speaking English] I swear,
I'll never do drugs again.

35:36.835 --> 35:38.168
[Zack] Are you kidding?

35:38.170 --> 35:42.305
We get out of this,
the first thing I'm gonna do,

35:42.307 --> 35:45.909
drugs! Lots and lots of drugs.

35:46.478 --> 35:49.212
Zack, remember when Rhonda
first gained consciousness?

35:49.414 --> 35:51.715
Her claustrophobia put her
in a completely different class

35:51.717 --> 35:53.216
of fear than the rest of us.

35:53.218 --> 35:56.353
The electrical activity
behind her chair was enormous,

35:56.355 --> 35:57.854
but it waned
when she hyperventilated

35:57.856 --> 36:00.390
and then stopped completely
the moment she passed out.

36:01.160 --> 36:03.226
This last surge
was most aggressive.

36:03.729 --> 36:05.428
When Rhonda was most afraid.

36:05.831 --> 36:07.631
And then just now, with Alex.

36:07.633 --> 36:10.867
I'm not afraid, okay?
I'm just pissed.

36:11.370 --> 36:13.904
You hear that, motherfuckers,
I'm just pissed!

36:13.906 --> 36:15.438
- [whooshing]
- There it is.

36:16.909 --> 36:18.475
I'm on to you, dammit.

36:19.444 --> 36:20.911
[John] That's not a coincidence.

36:20.913 --> 36:23.313
This whole time I assumed
it was coming from the ship.

36:23.315 --> 36:24.381
It isn't.

36:25.918 --> 36:27.417
It's coming from us.

36:27.419 --> 36:31.388
So, what,
you're saying we're, like, fuel?

36:31.390 --> 36:32.856
That's precisely
what I'm saying.

36:34.426 --> 36:35.859
It wants us to be afraid.

36:38.263 --> 36:39.529
It needs us to be.

36:39.932 --> 36:42.699
We're feeding
this son of a bitch.

36:43.702 --> 36:45.569
We're fucking fuel!?

36:45.571 --> 36:47.604
We knew they were
harvesting us for a reason,

36:47.606 --> 36:49.339
we just didn't know
what that reason was.

36:51.843 --> 36:52.909
Until now.

36:54.913 --> 36:56.346
Who are you?

37:02.654 --> 37:04.387
I work for the War Department.

37:05.824 --> 37:06.957
At least I did.

37:06.959 --> 37:09.893
Twenty-two years ago,
we uncovered the remains

37:09.895 --> 37:11.561
of an unidentified
flying object

37:11.563 --> 37:13.496
just outside
of Roswell, New Mexico.

37:13.699 --> 37:16.233
I was called in ahead
of the first response team.

37:16.235 --> 37:17.968
Fuck me, it's true.

37:18.470 --> 37:20.537
We managed to recover
most of the craft,

37:20.539 --> 37:22.806
including the occupant,
who died in the crash.

37:25.244 --> 37:26.843
[John] <i>We surmised early on</i>
<i>that the E.T.</i>

37:26.845 --> 37:29.246
<i>had a technopathic link
to his vessel.</i>

37:29.381 --> 37:31.348
<i>There was no throttle
or steering mechanism</i>

37:31.350 --> 37:32.749
<i>that we could identify,</i>

37:33.318 --> 37:35.252
<i>and when we dissected
the propulsion system</i>

37:35.254 --> 37:37.654
<i>we were unable to identify
an energy source.</i>

37:39.858 --> 37:41.324
<i>You see,
the creatures mind</i>

37:41.325 --> 37:42.791
<i>didn't just control
the craft,</i>

37:43.428 --> 37:44.761
<i>it powered it.</i>

37:44.963 --> 37:47.397
<i>It was hardwired
into the vessel.</i>

37:48.734 --> 37:50.734
<i>Somehow his species
had discovered a way</i>

37:50.736 --> 37:52.836
<i>to convert thought
into a viable form</i>

37:52.838 --> 37:54.771
<i>of kinetic energy.</i>

37:55.540 --> 37:58.575
I was to learn later
that Roswell wasn't the first.

37:59.511 --> 38:01.411
And it certainly
wasn't the last.

38:02.414 --> 38:04.714
A similar crash had occurred
in Pinos Altos

38:04.716 --> 38:05.949
a couple of years earlier.

38:07.019 --> 38:09.319
That discovery launched
the most comprehensive

38:09.321 --> 38:10.954
research program
ever undertaken

38:10.956 --> 38:12.422
by the U.S. government.

38:13.959 --> 38:16.726
Truth is, we didn't even know
what we were looking for.

38:18.030 --> 38:19.629
But what we found...

38:23.769 --> 38:25.102
changed everything.

38:25.103 --> 38:26.436
There was widespread
sporial contamination.

38:26.571 --> 38:28.305
Not just at the crash site,

38:28.307 --> 38:30.774
but throughout
the surrounding area,

38:30.776 --> 38:32.809
including a local
mining community.

38:33.679 --> 38:35.645
[John] <i> We tested everyone</i>
<i>in the town,</i>

38:35.647 --> 38:37.747
<i>men, women, children.</i>

38:37.749 --> 38:40.517
<i>All under the hospices
of possible contamination</i>

38:40.519 --> 38:42.385
<i>from a nearby
chemical spill.</i>

38:43.488 --> 38:44.954
<i>Not a single person
exhibited</i>

38:44.956 --> 38:46.690
<i>any signs of illness.</i>

38:47.059 --> 38:49.459
<i>No physical
or psychological illness,</i>

38:49.461 --> 38:51.861
<i>no mutagenic effects,
nothing.</i>

38:52.864 --> 38:54.764
<i>We detained them
for as long as we could,</i>

38:54.766 --> 38:57.400
<i>a town that small,
it's easy to raise suspicion.</i>

38:58.337 --> 39:00.537
<i>In the end,
we had to let them go.</i>

39:01.907 --> 39:03.106
<i>All but one.</i>

39:05.110 --> 39:07.944
Turned out one of the miner's
wives was pregnant.

39:08.814 --> 39:10.680
A blood sample
taken in utero

39:10.682 --> 39:12.949
revealed a hemoglobin
abnormality

39:13.685 --> 39:14.951
we'd never seen before.

39:16.655 --> 39:19.055
The child was confiscated
by order of the War Department

39:19.057 --> 39:20.957
and sent to Raven Rock
for further testing.

39:20.959 --> 39:22.692
What's Raven Rock?

39:22.694 --> 39:24.928
It's a top-secret
research facility.

39:27.733 --> 39:30.600
Like I said, mate,
wasn't born orange.

39:32.437 --> 39:34.404
Was it a boy or a girl?

39:35.841 --> 39:36.973
It was a girl.

39:38.977 --> 39:40.910
What happened to her parents?

39:45.450 --> 39:46.583
We switched it out.

39:46.584 --> 39:47.717
With a baby whose mother
had died in child birth.

39:49.788 --> 39:51.054
Her parents never knew.

39:51.790 --> 39:53.056
[speaking French]

39:53.058 --> 39:55.658
[John speaking English]
The hemoglobin abnormalities

39:55.660 --> 39:57.060
were only the beginning.

39:58.463 --> 40:00.497
<i>Brain scans showed
electrical activity</i>

40:00.499 --> 40:01.631
<i>so far off the charts</i>

40:01.633 --> 40:03.666
<i>they had to create
new systems of measurement.</i>

40:05.604 --> 40:07.937
<i>Visual and spatial acuity
were beyond anything</i>

40:07.939 --> 40:10.407
<i>we'd seen up to that point
or since.</i>

40:11.643 --> 40:13.410
<i>When the child
was 12 years old</i>

40:13.412 --> 40:16.946
<i>she manifested
an extraordinary ability.</i>

40:18.450 --> 40:20.083
<i>We called it
techlepathy.</i>

40:20.752 --> 40:22.118
The ability of the human brain

40:22.120 --> 40:24.587
to interface
with electrical based systems.

40:24.589 --> 40:26.423
<i>No doubt
a mutagenic response</i>

40:26.425 --> 40:28.091
<i>from sporial
contamination.</i>

40:28.927 --> 40:31.561
Of course, we didn't know
half of what we know now.

40:32.431 --> 40:34.531
Reverse engineering
their technology was slow

40:34.533 --> 40:36.866
and rather difficult.

40:38.637 --> 40:40.637
<i>Later, the mutagenic response
to the spores</i>

40:40.639 --> 40:42.038
<i>enabled the child
to communicate</i>

40:42.040 --> 40:43.873
<i>with the vessel
in the same way.</i>

40:44.209 --> 40:45.842
[Alex] <i> What did she do?</i>

40:46.778 --> 40:48.144
She opened the door.

40:50.048 --> 40:51.648
<i>That was the term
our team used</i>

40:51.650 --> 40:53.516
<i>for initializing
the vessel.</i>

40:54.886 --> 40:56.453
<i>She only did it once.</i>

40:57.689 --> 40:59.172
<i>Never would have
believed it</i>

40:59.173 --> 41:00.656
<i>if hadn't I seen it
with my own eyes.</i>

41:01.460 --> 41:02.992
<i>But for a few seconds,</i>

41:03.995 --> 41:06.062
<i>she was in techlopathic
communication</i>

41:06.064 --> 41:07.897
<i>with an alien technology.</i>

41:09.534 --> 41:10.867
<i>One that nearly
killed her.</i>

41:12.771 --> 41:14.037
<i>What she saw...</i>

41:15.740 --> 41:17.173
that's anyone's guess.

41:17.175 --> 41:18.741
She wouldn't talk about it.

41:18.743 --> 41:23.046
Apparently top brass felt
I was too close to the project.

41:24.749 --> 41:27.617
Too emotionally invested,
they said.

41:29.554 --> 41:31.020
<i>They were probably right.</i>

41:32.123 --> 41:33.156
[John] Sera.

41:34.993 --> 41:38.161
[John] Sera, I need you to tell
me when you can see the door.

41:39.764 --> 41:40.997
[Young Sera]
<i>I see it.</i>

41:44.102 --> 41:45.502
Good.

41:47.839 --> 41:49.672
Sera, I need you
to open it.

41:50.742 --> 41:52.008
[Young Sera] <i> Afraid.</i>

41:52.644 --> 41:53.676
[John] I know.

41:53.678 --> 41:56.779
I know, everything
is going to be okay.

41:57.816 --> 41:59.849
- I promise.
- [Young Sera] <i> Afraid.</i>

41:59.851 --> 42:01.584
Sera, honey,
listen, I need you to--

42:01.586 --> 42:02.719
Jesus, John.

42:04.022 --> 42:06.289
She's not
your goddamn daughter.

42:06.791 --> 42:09.526
She's a weapon.
Our weapon.

42:10.695 --> 42:12.295
The only one we've got.

42:15.300 --> 42:16.566
Sera.

42:17.903 --> 42:20.003
Activate the vessel, Sera.

42:21.873 --> 42:24.807
The world
is counting on us.

42:25.844 --> 42:28.545
[Borland] Do you understand
that, Sera?

42:29.314 --> 42:30.680
The world.

42:38.557 --> 42:39.923
- [electricity surges]
- [groans]

42:42.727 --> 42:46.329
Now, activate
the goddamn machine!

42:48.767 --> 42:49.832
Again.

42:50.635 --> 42:52.035
- [electricity surges]
- [groans]

42:52.037 --> 42:53.136
<i>Do it.</i>

42:56.007 --> 42:58.875
- General.
- Again.

42:59.044 --> 43:00.243
[electricity surges]

43:00.645 --> 43:02.211
- That's enough.
- Belay that order.

43:02.213 --> 43:05.281
General, look at her.
God damn it, Allister,

43:05.283 --> 43:06.983
you're gonna kill her,
that's enough.

43:12.090 --> 43:13.156
Go home.

43:13.925 --> 43:15.658
Don't come back

43:15.660 --> 43:18.361
until you have
your priorities figured out.

43:22.801 --> 43:25.935
I'm sorry about what happened
to your family, John.

43:26.271 --> 43:27.604
I am.

43:28.106 --> 43:30.707
But I've got a family too,
we all do.

43:31.309 --> 43:33.843
And I'll be goddamned
if I let those bastards

43:33.845 --> 43:35.612
take them away from us.

43:49.227 --> 43:51.894
[panting]

43:53.365 --> 43:54.631
I'm sorry.

43:54.633 --> 43:58.201
[John] <i> I was transferred</i>
<i>to Washington shortly after.</i>

43:59.904 --> 44:01.371
<i>But I made a promise.</i>

44:01.906 --> 44:04.140
<i>I wasn't about to let them
send a 12-year-old girl</i>

44:04.142 --> 44:06.142
<i>all alone
into an alien vessel.</i>

44:06.711 --> 44:08.461
<i>A colleague of mine</i>

44:08.462 --> 44:10.212
<i>had reverse engineered
the alien technology</i>

44:10.215 --> 44:12.081
<i>and so before I left</i>

44:12.083 --> 44:14.150
<i>we made certain
of one thing.</i>

44:15.086 --> 44:18.154
<i>If Sera went,
so would I.</i>

44:19.024 --> 44:20.423
[Young Sera]
<i>Do you have to leave?</i>

44:22.861 --> 44:23.993
Yeah, I do.

44:26.131 --> 44:27.764
Will you come back and visit?

44:29.834 --> 44:31.801
I'm afraid
it doesn't work like that.

44:33.271 --> 44:34.904
I don't want you to go.

44:39.244 --> 44:45.014
Hey, have I ever told you
how blue whales communicate?

44:45.150 --> 44:46.182
Uh-uh.

44:46.184 --> 44:47.750
It's pretty amazing.

44:48.386 --> 44:50.420
They can actually send
each other messages

44:50.422 --> 44:51.954
across the ocean.

44:51.956 --> 44:53.022
For real?

44:53.024 --> 44:54.207
[John] Oh, yeah.

44:54.208 --> 44:55.391
And I'm not talking
half the ocean,

44:55.393 --> 44:57.694
I'm talking the entire ocean.

44:58.263 --> 45:00.229
They send out
this little frequency pulse

45:00.231 --> 45:02.365
that travels
for thousands of miles.

45:03.368 --> 45:05.201
[mimics whale song]

45:07.038 --> 45:09.038
[John] Anyway, the nanites
in these transponders

45:09.040 --> 45:10.239
do kind of the same thing.

45:11.109 --> 45:13.142
Only they travel a lot further.

45:14.045 --> 45:15.344
How much further?

45:15.780 --> 45:17.313
Far enough that if anyone
ever tries

45:17.315 --> 45:20.116
taking you away from here,
they'll have to deal with me.

45:20.852 --> 45:22.118
And trust me,

45:22.387 --> 45:24.087
they don't want
to deal with me.

45:25.390 --> 45:26.723
Promise?

45:29.894 --> 45:30.960
Promise.

45:32.163 --> 45:34.397
You go, I go.

45:38.803 --> 45:39.936
It's ready, sir.

45:43.942 --> 45:45.875
[John] <i> That was the last</i>
<i>I saw her.</i>

45:47.011 --> 45:48.077
Until now.

45:49.881 --> 45:53.416
Specialized Extraterrestrial
Reconnaissance Agent.

45:57.355 --> 45:59.522
Sera for short.

46:02.460 --> 46:04.460
God knows
what they've done to her.

46:05.363 --> 46:06.896
[John] Still, she's here.

46:07.332 --> 46:09.465
Which means
they know something I don't.

46:10.335 --> 46:12.368
They wouldn't have sent her up
if they didn't think

46:12.370 --> 46:13.970
she could destroy
this damn thing

46:13.972 --> 46:15.938
or work her way
into its programming.

46:16.441 --> 46:17.774
Corrupt it.

46:17.776 --> 46:20.977
It's been our contingency
since the beginning.

46:23.248 --> 46:24.914
We called it Project Ithaca.

46:25.517 --> 46:27.483
[Perry]
Maybe they just got desperate.

46:27.485 --> 46:29.786
Who knows what happened
after you left.

46:30.789 --> 46:33.322
What I do know is,
that pony there,

46:33.558 --> 46:35.224
Odysseus she ain't.

46:36.394 --> 46:40.229
So...
we're all from different times.

46:41.099 --> 46:42.398
What year is it?

46:43.001 --> 46:44.333
[John]
It's impossible to say.

46:45.136 --> 46:47.136
We don't know if we've been
lying here in stasis

46:47.138 --> 46:49.906
or if this ship exists in some
kind of temporal anomaly.

46:49.908 --> 46:52.875
I think we have bigger problem.

47:00.919 --> 47:02.185
[whooshing]

47:06.391 --> 47:08.024
Oh, shit.

47:09.260 --> 47:10.326
Sera.

47:17.902 --> 47:19.836
[growls]

47:25.410 --> 47:27.977
[machine beeping]

47:27.979 --> 47:30.046
[doctor]
Her burns are severe, John.

47:32.016 --> 47:35.017
All we can do now is watch her,

47:35.920 --> 47:38.054
see how she responds
to the treatment.

47:40.225 --> 47:41.958
[doctor] But she's a fighter,
John.

47:43.194 --> 47:45.228
If anyone
can pull through this,

47:46.064 --> 47:47.296
it's Elizabeth.

47:52.337 --> 47:53.536
Of course,

47:54.172 --> 47:56.272
you know that everything
I'm saying

47:56.908 --> 47:57.974
is a lie.

48:00.612 --> 48:01.878
What?

48:04.148 --> 48:06.182
[voice distorts]
Elizabeth is gonna die, John.

48:08.486 --> 48:13.289
And even if there was some...
miracle,

48:14.626 --> 48:18.594
she would wish,
each and every day,

48:19.998 --> 48:21.330
that she had died.

48:23.234 --> 48:26.235
Because survival
means the worst pain

48:26.237 --> 48:28.938
you could possibly imagine.

48:33.511 --> 48:35.611
Not to mention
living without a face.

48:37.315 --> 48:40.583
Such a pretty girl.
It's a damn shame.

48:43.321 --> 48:45.354
And it's all because of you,
isn't it, John?

48:47.125 --> 48:51.661
Because you're a selfish,
stubborn, son of a bitch.

48:54.499 --> 48:56.465
Maybe you wanted
to stop at a motel.

48:57.268 --> 48:58.434
Do you remember?

48:59.270 --> 49:01.103
"John, stop, it's getting late,"

49:01.105 --> 49:03.506
but, no,
you had to drive,

49:03.975 --> 49:05.474
you had to keep going.

49:06.044 --> 49:09.078
The world
according to Agent Brighton.

49:10.315 --> 49:12.381
Mr. Big Shot!

49:12.650 --> 49:14.951
[chuckles]

49:15.420 --> 49:17.687
Mr. Government Man.

49:17.689 --> 49:20.022
[machine beeping quickly]

49:20.024 --> 49:22.491
No. No.

49:24.996 --> 49:26.062
No.

49:26.397 --> 49:28.331
[machine flat lines]

49:29.467 --> 49:30.533
No.

49:33.371 --> 49:36.238
[whooshing]

49:36.708 --> 49:38.607
[muffled groans]

49:48.252 --> 49:49.318
Well, now.

49:51.723 --> 49:53.356
Happy Christmas, love.

49:57.762 --> 50:00.062
And who the fuck might you be?

50:00.465 --> 50:01.664
Dad, it's me.

50:02.734 --> 50:04.000
It's Sammy.

50:05.103 --> 50:06.168
Really?

50:09.540 --> 50:11.273
Listen to me, you dumb cunt.

50:12.110 --> 50:16.012
I ain't your father,
and you ain't my sweet pea.

50:16.280 --> 50:19.148
So if you're trying to get
inside my fucking head,

50:19.150 --> 50:20.683
you can fuck off!

50:26.691 --> 50:30.292
I put that demon to rest
a long time ago.

50:31.362 --> 50:33.562
If you really wanted
to fuck me up,

50:35.099 --> 50:37.533
you'd have shown up
as my ex-wife.

50:41.472 --> 50:43.773
[voice distorts]
Bulmer. Perry Carrol.

50:44.642 --> 50:49.445
You have functioned
for 18,988 days.

50:49.447 --> 50:51.347
You are a primitive life form.

50:53.051 --> 50:54.817
Go fuck yourself!

50:54.819 --> 50:56.519
Fucking is irrelevant.

50:56.521 --> 50:59.055
Ah, see, that's
your first problem, innit?

51:00.658 --> 51:02.158
Are we done now?

51:02.693 --> 51:04.660
Soon you will cease to function.

51:05.696 --> 51:07.063
Right then.

51:08.366 --> 51:09.432
Well, in that case,

51:09.434 --> 51:11.367
I might as well
get some shut eye.

51:12.703 --> 51:15.604
Seeing as though
I can actually lie down.

51:26.350 --> 51:27.416
Mm.

51:39.497 --> 51:41.797
[man speaking French]

51:42.266 --> 51:43.432
[man chuckles]

51:49.507 --> 51:50.506

52:37.555 --> 52:38.621
Alex!

53:24.202 --> 53:25.267
[thud]

53:38.950 --> 53:40.249
[Sera] <i> John.</i>

53:47.825 --> 53:48.924
You're not real.

53:50.361 --> 53:51.627
[Sera] It's me, John.

53:53.931 --> 53:54.997
It's Sera.

54:04.976 --> 54:06.242
How?

54:06.244 --> 54:09.778
I isolated a channel
in your pre-frontal cortex

54:09.780 --> 54:12.248
<i>so we can communicate
without them knowing.</i>

54:12.250 --> 54:13.949
[Sera] The sensation is odd,
I know.

54:15.419 --> 54:16.819
What is this place?

54:17.255 --> 54:18.520
[Sera] An echo.

54:18.889 --> 54:20.356
[John] Why here?

54:22.426 --> 54:24.026
It's Rhonda's safe place.

54:27.298 --> 54:28.631
A powerful memory.

54:34.839 --> 54:36.005
Peaceful.

54:40.344 --> 54:41.910
I can see why she chose it.

54:43.814 --> 54:44.880
Now that she's gone,

54:44.882 --> 54:46.849
it's no longer
important to them.

54:46.851 --> 54:48.817
They won't think
to look for us here.

54:52.556 --> 54:54.290
I know what they want, John.

54:54.792 --> 54:56.425
But we don't have much time.

54:56.761 --> 54:58.394
What did they do to you?

54:59.830 --> 55:01.063
What they had to.

55:03.367 --> 55:05.301
[Sera] <i> General Borland</i>
<i>wanted assurances</i>

55:05.303 --> 55:06.835
<i>that his plan
to destroy the vessel</i>

55:06.837 --> 55:08.971
<i>wouldn't be uncovered
by an alien technology</i>

55:08.973 --> 55:10.773
<i>capable
of reading minds.</i>

55:11.709 --> 55:13.509
<i>Erasing my memory
was the only way</i>

55:13.511 --> 55:15.978
<i>of ensuring I wouldn't
be perceived as a threat.</i>

55:17.048 --> 55:19.715
Once aboard, it was hoped
that the sporial nanites

55:19.717 --> 55:21.050
would automatically interface

55:21.052 --> 55:22.851
with their corresponding
technology

55:22.853 --> 55:24.386
and repair the damage.

55:25.056 --> 55:27.856
It was a calculated risk
that seems to have worked.

55:28.959 --> 55:30.759
Even now I can feel
my connection

55:30.761 --> 55:32.728
<i>to the vessel growing stronger.</i>

55:33.731 --> 55:34.830
What is it?

55:34.832 --> 55:36.398
[Sera] <i> A biomechanoid.</i>

55:36.400 --> 55:38.334
<i>Governed
by a highly advanced</i>

55:38.336 --> 55:40.469
<i>artificial
super intelligence.</i>

55:40.805 --> 55:42.104
[John] <i> And the door?</i>

55:43.407 --> 55:44.473
Ajar.

55:44.475 --> 55:49.078
[Sera] You were right, John.
They're harvesting energy.

55:49.080 --> 55:50.346
Why?

55:50.348 --> 55:52.781
They're protecting
a digitized life form,

55:52.783 --> 55:55.851
suspended in an electrified,
plasmic matrix.

55:56.087 --> 55:58.954
It requires
a unique energy signature.

55:58.956 --> 56:00.022
Us.

56:00.024 --> 56:02.691
It's tapping our emotions
as a food source.

56:02.693 --> 56:04.126
[Sera] That's not all.

56:04.562 --> 56:07.429
Their secondary purpose
is to harvest enough energy

56:07.431 --> 56:09.531
to open
an interdimensional portal.

56:09.533 --> 56:10.833
They're transferring ships?

56:11.102 --> 56:12.634
Not only ships.

56:13.838 --> 56:14.903
Bodies.

56:16.006 --> 56:17.606
Their bodies.

56:18.676 --> 56:20.776
This ship was designed
to create a stabilized

56:20.778 --> 56:23.078
density matrix
allowing it to exist

56:23.080 --> 56:24.980
along multiple points in time.

56:24.982 --> 56:26.648
[John] That explains things.

56:26.984 --> 56:29.118
But I don't understand,
why would it do that,

56:29.120 --> 56:32.721
- the energy expenditure alone--
- They're looking for something.

56:33.090 --> 56:35.924
- What are they looking for?
- Me.

56:36.894 --> 56:39.628
Sera, I don't understand,
why are they looking for you?

56:42.733 --> 56:43.932
Something's wrong.

56:50.608 --> 56:52.841
[Gran] Thought we could use
a moment alone.

57:02.720 --> 57:04.753
She's a bad seed that one.

57:05.823 --> 57:08.190
You'd do well
to stay away from her.

57:09.126 --> 57:10.459
What are you?

57:10.461 --> 57:14.196
Oh, Atticus.
We are old.

57:14.765 --> 57:15.831
Tired.

57:17.001 --> 57:19.935
Tired of fighting,
tired of traveling.

57:20.938 --> 57:23.172
[Gran] Some of us just
wanna go home.

57:24.542 --> 57:26.175
Isn't that what you want?

57:26.944 --> 57:28.644
What all of yous want?

57:29.146 --> 57:30.579
To go home?

57:32.116 --> 57:33.549
How do you know my name?

57:33.551 --> 57:35.984
[Gran] Brighton, Atticus John.

57:36.754 --> 57:39.021
Oh, we know plenty about you.

57:40.024 --> 57:41.590
For instance,

57:41.859 --> 57:44.526
did you know
that you've been functioning

57:44.528 --> 57:48.964
for 18,537 days,

57:49.099 --> 57:52.935
four minutes and ten,

57:52.937 --> 57:55.637
eleven, twelve...

57:56.507 --> 57:58.173
Well, you get the picture.

58:00.077 --> 58:03.479
You know, we seen all kinds,

58:04.582 --> 58:07.816
and in the grand
ol' scheme of things,

58:08.085 --> 58:10.152
humans ain't nothin' special.

58:11.055 --> 58:14.556
Well, we don't mean that
in no disparaging way,

58:15.125 --> 58:17.192
just is what it is.

58:18.562 --> 58:23.899
In fact, most yall ain't worth
the sack of skin ya came in.

58:26.170 --> 58:30.038
But you, Atticus,
you're different.

58:30.975 --> 58:33.008
We got our eyes on you.

58:34.545 --> 58:37.212
[Gran] <i> Yes, sir. We sure do.</i>

58:43.721 --> 58:46.122
What is this?

58:46.123 --> 58:48.524
[Gran] <i> Why, Atticus,</i>
<i>this is our moment.</i>

58:49.260 --> 58:51.894
<i>You see,
some of us understand</i>

58:51.896 --> 58:54.997
<i>that sometimes
you gotta break the rules.</i>

58:55.299 --> 58:57.766
<i>Sometimes
for the greater good,</i>

58:57.768 --> 59:01.069
<i>you even gotta go up
against your own kind.</i>

59:01.272 --> 59:02.938
<i>Help the helpless.</i>

59:03.173 --> 59:06.808
<i>In our case,
that means helping you.</i>

59:11.015 --> 59:12.965
[man] Once activated...

59:12.966 --> 59:14.916
[Gran] <i>Ever since your wife</i>
<i>and daughter died,</i>

59:14.919 --> 59:17.586
<i>you been chasin'
forgiveness.</i>

59:18.055 --> 59:19.922
<i>Isn't that right, Atticus?</i>

59:20.824 --> 59:24.593
<i>Chased it all the way down
to that there little girl.</i>

59:25.563 --> 59:28.830
<i>That's good.
Sera needs you.</i>

59:29.033 --> 59:30.699
<i>And you need her.</i>

59:33.270 --> 59:35.604
<i>You go, I go.</i>

59:35.839 --> 59:38.173
<i>Now, there's
a lovely proposition.</i>

59:39.043 --> 59:43.612
<i>But, you see, technology's
a funny thing, Atticus.</i>

59:44.114 --> 59:48.750
<i>Imperfect machines
made by imperfect men.</i>

59:49.186 --> 59:53.121
<i>All them scientists
so pleased with themselves.</i>

59:53.123 --> 59:55.657
<i>That unbeknownst
to y'all,</i>

59:55.659 --> 59:59.995
<i>a power surge goes
and blows it all to hell.</i>

01:00:07.805 --> 01:00:11.039
<i>Your transponder failed,
Atticus.</i>

01:00:11.041 --> 01:00:12.374
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

01:00:12.910 --> 01:00:16.278
<i>Isn't fate
just the damnest thing?</i>

01:00:20.651 --> 01:00:23.752
[pants]

01:00:26.023 --> 01:00:27.873
[Sera] You should know by now

01:00:27.874 --> 01:00:29.724
that struggling
isn't in your best interests.

01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:32.961
You.

01:00:34.832 --> 01:00:36.031
You're talking?

01:00:36.867 --> 01:00:37.933
As are you.

01:00:39.970 --> 01:00:41.837
Like a normal person.

01:00:53.717 --> 01:00:54.783
We...

01:00:56.053 --> 01:00:59.655
We all thought you were, uh,
you know, batshit crazy.

01:01:00.758 --> 01:01:03.859
- Batshit?
- Crazy.

01:01:05.029 --> 01:01:07.195
I'm fully cognizant
of our situation.

01:01:10.734 --> 01:01:12.100
What did they do to you?

01:01:13.837 --> 01:01:15.103
What they had to.

01:01:18.008 --> 01:01:20.342
- Did it hurt?
- [Sera] Yes.

01:01:23.147 --> 01:01:24.746
But it was necessary.

01:01:26.950 --> 01:01:28.150
I'm sorry.

01:01:37.094 --> 01:01:38.193
I...

01:01:40.831 --> 01:01:42.931
I wanted to say thank you.

01:01:46.870 --> 01:01:49.071
I was only 11
when it happened

01:01:49.073 --> 01:01:51.440
- and my mother, she--
- [Sera] You're welcome.

01:01:55.412 --> 01:01:58.346
You know, I always fantasized
about doing that.

01:02:02.453 --> 01:02:03.852
So is it true?

01:02:04.922 --> 01:02:06.054
What John said?

01:02:06.056 --> 01:02:09.791
That, uh, you can really speak
to this thing?

01:02:11.295 --> 01:02:14.229
The nanites provide
a stabilized neural interface,

01:02:14.231 --> 01:02:15.297
yes.

01:02:16.867 --> 01:02:19.101
So you can get us out of here?

01:02:20.137 --> 01:02:21.269
I don't know.

01:02:21.271 --> 01:02:24.940
I don't understand.
I thought you just said that--

01:02:24.942 --> 01:02:27.776
- They severed the link.
- But...

01:02:31.148 --> 01:02:34.015
They sent you up here
to help us, right?

01:02:34.952 --> 01:02:39.020
I mean, uh, isn't that
why they sent you up here?

01:02:40.357 --> 01:02:41.423
Yes.

01:02:49.099 --> 01:02:52.100
I don't want to die, you know?

01:02:52.503 --> 01:02:55.403
I know I spent
my whole bloody life trying,

01:02:56.306 --> 01:02:58.907
but I don't, not really.

01:03:00.844 --> 01:03:02.911
You're not going to die,
Alex Gauthier.

01:03:04.414 --> 01:03:06.782
- You just said you can't.
- Look at me.

01:03:08.018 --> 01:03:09.384
You're not going to die.

01:03:10.454 --> 01:03:11.820
Not here.

01:03:12.389 --> 01:03:13.822
Not in this thing.

01:03:15.893 --> 01:03:17.225
How do you know?

01:03:18.796 --> 01:03:19.995
I just do.

01:03:29.406 --> 01:03:30.472
Sera.

01:03:31.208 --> 01:03:32.941
John. Are you all right?

01:03:32.943 --> 01:03:34.576
Sera, they know
about the transponder.

01:03:34.578 --> 01:03:35.977
[Sera] Yes.

01:03:35.979 --> 01:03:37.179
What transponder?

01:03:37.181 --> 01:03:38.880
Then you know
it shouldn't have worked.

01:03:38.882 --> 01:03:40.816
- What?
- [John] I saw it, Sera.

01:03:40.818 --> 01:03:42.551
My transponder
was never calibrated.

01:03:42.553 --> 01:03:43.852
It was never initialized.

01:03:43.854 --> 01:03:45.086
What transponder?

01:03:45.088 --> 01:03:47.022
[Perry] Jesus, mate.

01:03:47.023 --> 01:03:48.957
C'mon, just a couple of seconds.
Shut your gob.

01:03:48.959 --> 01:03:50.158
It wasn't initialized.

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:51.960
No, that's impossible.

01:03:52.896 --> 01:03:54.429
You go, I go, remember?

01:03:57.201 --> 01:04:00.068
There was an accident.
Human error.

01:04:03.507 --> 01:04:05.006
They knew about you.

01:04:08.178 --> 01:04:09.377
About Ithaca.

01:04:12.216 --> 01:04:13.315
They knew about everything.

01:04:13.317 --> 01:04:15.050
So much for your Trojan Horse.

01:04:15.352 --> 01:04:16.918
Don't you see, Sera?

01:04:18.555 --> 01:04:20.055
[John] They brought me here.

01:04:21.625 --> 01:04:22.958
<i>They</i> brought me here.

01:04:25.095 --> 01:04:26.161
Why?

01:04:30.334 --> 01:04:33.168
Back at Raven Rock, when you
initialized the craft...

01:04:36.406 --> 01:04:37.539
what did you see?

01:04:39.243 --> 01:04:40.308
Death.

01:04:41.945 --> 01:04:43.011
Rhonda's death.

01:04:45.616 --> 01:04:47.415
- What?
- [Perry] Fuck me.

01:04:48.485 --> 01:04:50.118
You saw the future?

01:04:50.921 --> 01:04:52.487
In a manner of speaking.

01:04:52.656 --> 01:04:54.055
In a manner of speaking.

01:04:55.626 --> 01:04:58.293
You saw a woman's death 10 years
before it happened, love.

01:04:58.495 --> 01:05:00.028
What other manner is there?

01:05:00.197 --> 01:05:02.163
And what about the rest of us?

01:05:02.666 --> 01:05:04.466
I didn't see anything else.

01:05:05.369 --> 01:05:09.004
Listen, if what Johnny boy says
about you is true,

01:05:09.006 --> 01:05:12.674
then I think now would be
a brilliant time to prove it.

01:05:13.010 --> 01:05:15.110
Yeah?

01:05:15.111 --> 01:05:17.211
So how about you do
whatever it is you do,

01:05:17.214 --> 01:05:20.982
and, um, I don't know,
get us the fuck outta here.

01:05:21.318 --> 01:05:24.352
I can't.
They severed the interface.

01:05:25.255 --> 01:05:29.457
Um, slight problem.
We're on a ship, right?

01:05:30.093 --> 01:05:31.393
In outer space.

01:05:31.962 --> 01:05:34.162
I mean, even if we get out
of this, then...

01:05:34.164 --> 01:05:36.932
Then what, 'cause, you know,
it's fucking space.

01:05:37.367 --> 01:05:38.433
[Perry] Right.

01:05:39.469 --> 01:05:41.136
- She does have a--
- [whooshing]

01:05:41.271 --> 01:05:42.704
[groans]

01:05:47.544 --> 01:05:49.177
[Gran] Beautiful, isn't it?

01:05:50.714 --> 01:05:51.980
Peaceful.

01:05:51.982 --> 01:05:56.284
Hard to believe
all of those horrible things

01:05:56.286 --> 01:05:58.586
could be happening
just a few feet away.

01:06:00.524 --> 01:06:02.123
[groans]

01:06:03.493 --> 01:06:07.495
Strapped down
in those ghastly ol' things.

01:06:09.232 --> 01:06:10.598
But they are.

01:06:12.302 --> 01:06:15.170
Yes, Miss Sera,
they most certainly are.

01:06:21.044 --> 01:06:22.243
What are you?

01:06:23.981 --> 01:06:25.180
Well, dear...

01:06:25.649 --> 01:06:29.117
I've always maintained
that what we are

01:06:29.653 --> 01:06:33.488
isn't anywhere near
as important as who we are.

01:06:34.591 --> 01:06:36.157
[groans]

01:06:41.064 --> 01:06:42.430
Stop what you're doing.

01:06:44.034 --> 01:06:46.518
Let us go.

01:06:46.519 --> 01:06:49.003
Oh, I couldn't do that
even if I wanted to.

01:06:51.375 --> 01:06:52.674
Tell me, Miss Sera,

01:06:54.077 --> 01:06:57.345
how many people you reckon
are aboard this vessel?

01:06:58.181 --> 01:06:59.280
Thousands.

01:06:59.282 --> 01:07:01.116
[Gran]
You can feel them, can't ya?

01:07:01.785 --> 01:07:07.088
All those souls,
crying out, suffering.

01:07:08.091 --> 01:07:09.758
Just like your friends
are suffering.

01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:13.695
[groans]

01:07:14.164 --> 01:07:18.166
I used to always wonder
why you cared so much.

01:07:18.668 --> 01:07:21.569
You ain't never been treated
well by nobody.

01:07:21.705 --> 01:07:23.071
Except John.

01:07:24.341 --> 01:07:26.441
You don't owe these people
nothing.

01:07:27.811 --> 01:07:31.646
But I know you now, Miss Sera.

01:07:32.382 --> 01:07:35.183
Yes, ma'am. I sure do.

01:07:36.686 --> 01:07:40.522
[screams]

01:07:41.391 --> 01:07:45.326
Oh, we're coming on
dreadful times, Miss Sera.

01:07:46.129 --> 01:07:47.429
Dreadful times.

01:07:48.265 --> 01:07:51.332
Of course,
you already know that.

01:07:53.603 --> 01:07:57.205
Was it just some accident
that your momma was infected

01:07:57.207 --> 01:08:00.341
by those spores that
made you what you are?

01:08:01.278 --> 01:08:02.477
I don't rightly know,

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:05.413
but I've been around
a long time.

01:08:06.183 --> 01:08:07.649
A long time.

01:08:08.785 --> 01:08:13.621
Long enough to know that fate
is one fickle bitch.

01:08:16.158 --> 01:08:17.425
Is that it?

01:08:17.594 --> 01:08:18.760
[snarls]

01:08:18.761 --> 01:08:20.795
Is that all you fucking got?

01:08:21.298 --> 01:08:23.363
You fucking wankers!

01:08:23.366 --> 01:08:26.768
What the hell are you doing?
Stop provoking them, man.

01:08:27.671 --> 01:08:29.804
Oh, sweetheart,
I didn't know you cared.

01:08:29.805 --> 01:08:31.473
[shrieks]

01:08:31.707 --> 01:08:35.143
We've been going round
and round and round

01:08:35.145 --> 01:08:36.644
with you, Miss Sera.

01:08:38.515 --> 01:08:41.616
A good many of us
are just plain tired.

01:08:43.153 --> 01:08:44.685
We just wanna go home.

01:08:45.589 --> 01:08:47.522
You're not making any sense.

01:08:48.457 --> 01:08:49.691
Why are you here?

01:08:49.693 --> 01:08:51.392
Why, Miss Sera?

01:08:52.462 --> 01:08:53.595
To help ya.

01:08:53.596 --> 01:08:54.662
[cries]

01:08:56.133 --> 01:09:00.801
You got power in you.
Real power.

01:09:01.671 --> 01:09:03.770
More than they care to admit.

01:09:05.242 --> 01:09:06.908
You make em' afraid.

01:09:07.877 --> 01:09:10.278
And they ain't used
to being afraid.

01:09:11.747 --> 01:09:14.149
You can get out of here
if you want to.

01:09:15.752 --> 01:09:17.318
Save your friends.

01:09:18.354 --> 01:09:19.587
Always could.

01:09:20.724 --> 01:09:21.923
Tell me how.

01:09:22.526 --> 01:09:26.426
Well, now,
only you can answer that.

01:09:28.365 --> 01:09:32.567
All you have to ask yourself,
Miss Sera, is

01:09:32.903 --> 01:09:35.569
what opens the door?

01:09:36.907 --> 01:09:39.741
[Zack screams]

01:09:44.514 --> 01:09:46.281
No!

01:09:46.716 --> 01:09:50.718
[screams]

01:09:51.488 --> 01:09:54.322
[Zack screaming]

01:10:01.865 --> 01:10:07.869
You are different
from the others.

01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:11.973
Like us.

01:10:14.344 --> 01:10:17.745
But not like us.

01:10:18.381 --> 01:10:19.981
[gasping]

01:10:20.383 --> 01:10:21.883
Tell us...

01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:26.721
what are you?

01:10:26.723 --> 01:10:27.989
[sobbing]

01:10:29.392 --> 01:10:30.758
What...

01:10:31.695 --> 01:10:33.361
are...

01:10:33.830 --> 01:10:35.530
you.

01:10:36.466 --> 01:10:37.632
Leave her alone.

01:10:48.311 --> 01:10:49.544
You.

01:10:51.014 --> 01:10:55.650
You will die.

01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:02.523
They will die.

01:11:03.693 --> 01:11:08.396
Your entire species...

01:11:09.366 --> 01:11:11.633
will die.

01:11:11.835 --> 01:11:13.368
We'll fight.

01:11:15.505 --> 01:11:21.042
It'll make no difference.

01:11:25.615 --> 01:11:26.814
[groans]

01:11:28.752 --> 01:11:29.984
We might surprise you.

01:11:29.986 --> 01:11:34.389
You are...

01:11:35.525 --> 01:11:37.892
ordinary.

01:11:39.763 --> 01:11:42.030
Here I thought you knew
everything about us.

01:11:43.767 --> 01:11:46.834
We're human beings,
you murderous son of a bitch,

01:11:47.537 --> 01:11:49.404
we're anything but ordinary.

01:11:53.710 --> 01:11:57.445
- [snarls]
- [grunts]

01:11:58.748 --> 01:12:01.482
The world is counting on us.

01:12:02.752 --> 01:12:05.386
If you're inside this thing,
I need you to open the door.

01:12:07.090 --> 01:12:08.690
<i>She only did it once.</i>

01:12:08.692 --> 01:12:10.858
[Gran] <i> You got power in you.</i>

01:12:10.994 --> 01:12:12.460
[snarls]

01:12:14.931 --> 01:12:16.364
[Sera] <i> Sera.</i>

01:12:17.467 --> 01:12:18.866
<i>Sera, I need your help.</i>

01:12:21.338 --> 01:12:22.737
Sera, what do you see?

01:12:24.474 --> 01:12:25.973
[Young Sera]
<i>I see...</i>

01:12:27.744 --> 01:12:30.011
<i>- you.</i>
- [screams]

01:12:31.881 --> 01:12:34.615
[Alex] So is it true?
What John said?

01:12:34.784 --> 01:12:37.018
You can really speak
to this thing?

01:12:37.587 --> 01:12:40.421
[Sera] The nanites provide
a stabilized neural interface.

01:12:40.423 --> 01:12:41.689
[Sera and Young Sera]
Yes.

01:12:41.691 --> 01:12:45.093
[Alex] <i>They sent you up here</i>
<i>to help us, right?</i>

01:12:45.795 --> 01:12:49.964
I mean, uh, isn't that
why they sent you up here?

01:12:49.966 --> 01:12:51.132
[Sera and Young Sera]
Yes.

01:12:51.134 --> 01:12:53.334
[John] <i>We don't know if</i>
<i>we've been lying here in stasis</i>

01:12:53.335 --> 01:12:55.535
or if this ship exists in
some kind of temporal anomaly.

01:12:55.538 --> 01:12:57.505
- It's 2050.
- It's 2001!

01:12:57.507 --> 01:12:59.224
- It's 1977.
- 1969.

01:12:59.225 --> 01:13:00.942
[Sera] <i>The ship is designed</i>
<i>to create a stabilized</i>

01:13:00.944 --> 01:13:03.010
<i>density matrix,
allowing it to exist</i>

01:13:03.012 --> 01:13:04.779
<i>among multiple points</i>
<i>in time.</i> [echoes]

01:13:08.752 --> 01:13:12.553
[John] <i> Sera.</i>
<i>What opens the door?</i>

01:13:14.057 --> 01:13:15.523
[Sera and Young Sera]
We do.

01:13:47.157 --> 01:13:48.823
[speaking backwards]

01:14:17.821 --> 01:14:19.020
They're coming.

01:14:19.889 --> 01:14:21.823
Sera, what was that?
What did I just see?

01:14:22.892 --> 01:14:24.926
You have everything you need
to stop them.

01:14:26.496 --> 01:14:27.962
Sera, I don't understand.

01:14:30.934 --> 01:14:32.200
Goodbye, John.

01:14:32.969 --> 01:14:34.035
What?

01:14:37.941 --> 01:14:40.942
No. Sera, don't.

01:14:42.679 --> 01:14:45.546
You go, I go. Remember?

01:14:46.916 --> 01:14:48.816
You go, I go.

01:14:49.085 --> 01:14:50.818
It doesn't work like that.

01:14:51.521 --> 01:14:53.020
[John] No, Sera, don't.

01:14:54.824 --> 01:14:56.157
You can't do this.

01:14:58.761 --> 01:15:00.728
Goddamn it, Sera, no!

01:15:03.166 --> 01:15:04.565
Goodbye.

01:15:06.536 --> 01:15:08.269
No!

01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:43.070
[Sera] <i> They've been</i>
<i>taking us for years.</i>

01:15:47.076 --> 01:15:49.043
<i>They take us
against our will.</i>

01:15:54.150 --> 01:15:55.816
<i>From our homes...</i>

01:15:58.121 --> 01:15:59.787
<i>and from our families.</i>

01:16:02.959 --> 01:16:04.792
<i>But there are those
among us</i>

01:16:04.794 --> 01:16:06.961
<i>with the ability
to fight back.</i>

01:16:11.768 --> 01:16:13.701
<i>To level
the playing field.</i>

01:16:18.341 --> 01:16:20.641
<i>Until now,
we were unknown to them.</i>

01:16:24.914 --> 01:16:27.081
<i>Until now, they thought
we were helpless.</i>

01:16:34.724 --> 01:16:35.890
<i>We're not.</i>
