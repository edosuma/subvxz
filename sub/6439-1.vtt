WEBVTT

00:19.687 --> 00:22.127
Spartacus:
There is but one path...

00:22.022 --> 00:23.481
we kill them all.

00:23.649 --> 00:26.484
(screaming)

00:26.652 --> 00:28.027
(woman screaming)

00:28.195 --> 00:30.196
(men grunting)

00:34.618 --> 00:36.369
I am your dominus!

00:36.537 --> 00:38.788
I will have your fucking hearts!

00:38.956 --> 00:40.623
Quintus.

00:43.669 --> 00:45.086
Lucretia.

00:47.172 --> 00:49.799
What would you do

00:49.967 --> 00:53.469
to hold your wife again,

00:53.637 --> 00:57.849
to feel the warmth of her skin,

00:58.016 --> 01:00.184
the taste of her lips?

01:00.352 --> 01:03.479
How many men would you kill?

01:05.816 --> 01:07.692
Quintus: I left the deed
in Barca's hands.

01:07.860 --> 01:09.902
Now you're free.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.822
Quintus: We are betrayed by
the Beast of fucking Carthage.

01:16.452 --> 01:18.911
You are beneath me.

01:19.079 --> 01:21.789
Lucretia:
He is a magistrate.

01:21.957 --> 01:25.251
Solonius: One can never know
who is plotting violence, can one?

01:25.419 --> 01:28.004
Quintus: Or when they may
commit the act.

01:30.799 --> 01:34.177
Your wife... she moves ever closer
even as we speak.

01:34.344 --> 01:37.847
My word is kept.
They're reunited.

01:42.060 --> 01:45.730
Lucretia: You will become
the greatest lanista in the Republic.

01:47.441 --> 01:50.943
Quintus: Under such a title
we will climb beyond our station,

01:51.111 --> 01:53.404
beyond Capua,

01:53.572 --> 01:57.617
perhaps to the very steps
of the Senate itself.

01:59.077 --> 02:01.329
(crowd shouting)

02:12.841 --> 02:15.635
The fights are particularly
entertaining today.

02:15.803 --> 02:18.054
You'd enjoy them more
viewed from the pulvenus.

02:21.809 --> 02:22.975
Fucking shit-eater.

02:23.143 --> 02:25.311
Let Vettius preen like a woman.

02:25.479 --> 02:28.940
You'll school him in the ways of men
when Gannicus takes to the sands.

02:29.107 --> 02:30.942
Absent Tullius and the magistrate
to bear witness,

02:31.109 --> 02:33.194
what's the fucking purpose?

02:33.362 --> 02:35.488
One man in today's games,
one only,

02:35.656 --> 02:37.532
and the seats needing to impress
stand empty

02:37.699 --> 02:40.117
as Vettius' fucking head.

02:45.791 --> 02:47.667
Get up!
(shouts)

02:48.877 --> 02:50.586
Get up!

02:58.303 --> 03:00.721
Solonius, what news?

03:00.889 --> 03:03.724
Tullius and the magistrate were delayed
with pressing business,

03:03.892 --> 03:04.892
but arrive shortly,

03:05.060 --> 03:07.979
as long as this current match
continues.

03:11.525 --> 03:13.359
No. Get up!

03:13.527 --> 03:14.944
Capua!

03:15.988 --> 03:18.489
Get up, get up, you fuck.

03:19.783 --> 03:23.077
(people shouting)

03:30.502 --> 03:32.837
Vettius begins the match
without proper introduction.

03:33.005 --> 03:34.213
- Proper?
- Capua!

03:34.381 --> 03:36.716
Quintus: Vettius and the word
are of distant relations.

03:36.884 --> 03:39.176
I, for one, am grateful
to be spared his oratory.

03:39.344 --> 03:41.971
The man's voice
causes skull to ache.

03:42.139 --> 03:44.599
Arghh!

03:44.766 --> 03:46.100
Gannicus takes position.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.942
(crowd cheering)

04:07.873 --> 04:09.916
Now there's a fucking gladiator!

04:33.982 --> 04:36.150
Man:
Tear his fucking face off!

04:41.281 --> 04:42.573
Man #2:
Fucking kill him!

04:42.741 --> 04:43.950
Begin.

04:51.875 --> 04:53.876
(Gannicus laughing)

04:57.089 --> 04:58.923
(laughing)

05:14.898 --> 05:17.692
Is your man
ever of a serious note?

05:17.859 --> 05:21.070
He can strip naked and fight
with his cock, as long as he wins.

05:21.238 --> 05:24.073
Gannicus, I love you!

05:26.827 --> 05:28.411
(gladiator yelling)

05:32.958 --> 05:34.667
(laughing)

05:34.835 --> 05:36.210
(yelling)

05:43.969 --> 05:45.928
What's he doing, Quintus?

06:47.407 --> 06:48.783
Fucking kill him!

06:51.828 --> 06:54.038
No. Wait for the magistrate.

06:54.206 --> 06:55.539
Kill kill kill!

06:55.707 --> 06:59.919
Gannicus, do not kill him!

07:00.087 --> 07:03.923
Do not kill him yet!

07:27.948 --> 07:31.700
Oh, now they arrive.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.246
A victory regardless.

07:35.413 --> 07:37.289
Won in dewy morn.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.500
None of the important
matches happen

07:39.668 --> 07:41.627
till after the midday sun
has passed.

07:41.795 --> 07:45.047
Consider yourself fortunate
to have a man in the games at all.

07:45.215 --> 07:48.425
Good Solonius stands
with empty hands.

07:51.555 --> 07:54.974
Come then, let us see them
filled with drink.

07:55.142 --> 07:57.476
Tell Doctore to see Gannicus
back to the ludus

07:57.644 --> 08:00.646
and have him properly
rewarded for his showing.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.523
Lucretia: Can we not stay
for the rest of the games?

08:02.691 --> 08:04.483
Vettius' men command
the prominent matches.

08:04.651 --> 08:06.694
He has more than enough eyes
to watch him stroke his cock.

08:06.862 --> 08:08.863
I would not add ours
to the sight.

08:09.865 --> 08:12.783
Gannicus:
Now you want me, Capua.

08:12.951 --> 08:15.119
(Gannicus laughing)

08:15.287 --> 08:17.788
Doctore.

08:21.168 --> 08:23.627
Dominus orders Gannicus
returned to the ludus,

08:23.795 --> 08:25.379
and seen to reward.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.967
Perhaps one day
the pretty little bitch

08:30.135 --> 08:31.760
will fight later
in the afternoon,

08:31.928 --> 08:33.679
with the rest of the men.

08:33.847 --> 08:37.558
You and your tiny cock
best pray that day never come.

08:37.726 --> 08:40.186
(kisses)

08:40.352 --> 08:41.854
(grunts, spits)

08:42.022 --> 08:44.523
Save blood for the fucking
sands, Gannicus.

08:44.691 --> 08:47.318
What seized fucking brain,

08:47.485 --> 08:49.528
releasing your swords
in the arena?

08:49.696 --> 08:53.532
I could have killed the man
absent an arm and both fucking legs.

08:53.700 --> 08:55.618
Hubris...

08:55.785 --> 08:57.494
a fine quality

08:57.662 --> 09:00.789
often possessed by cunts
who perish from it.

09:00.957 --> 09:02.875
(screaming)

09:03.043 --> 09:04.919
Did you catch
the manner of his eye

09:05.086 --> 09:06.795
as he gazed down
from the pulvenus?

09:06.963 --> 09:09.298
Fucking Vettius...

09:09.466 --> 09:11.133
barely free
of his mother's tit,

09:11.301 --> 09:14.511
yet he carries himself above lanistas
of more deserving years.

09:14.679 --> 09:16.722
Lucretia: Youth often imagines itself
swollen beyond worth.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.933
Solonius: Time will cure him
of the condition,

09:19.100 --> 09:20.851
as it does
all foolish young men.

09:21.019 --> 09:22.978
Time is what he holds
in abundance.

09:23.146 --> 09:25.314
The new arena will be finished
in but a handful of months.

09:25.482 --> 09:27.316
If we are excluded
from the opening games...

09:27.484 --> 09:29.818
Vettius is but shit
from a shit town.

09:29.986 --> 09:32.196
How can Tullius
and the magistrate

09:32.364 --> 09:34.698
favor a boy from Nola
over one of Capua's own sons?

09:34.866 --> 09:36.116
Well, how do they do it now?

09:36.284 --> 09:38.410
We must prove ourselves
in the more important bouts

09:38.578 --> 09:40.871
in the old arena
and secure position.

09:41.039 --> 09:43.415
To fight later in the day,
we must first distinguish ourselves

09:43.583 --> 09:45.834
against Vettius' men.
Yet Vettius' men only fight...

09:46.002 --> 09:47.211
Together:
Later in the day.

09:47.379 --> 09:48.921
A vexing conundrum.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.297
Lucretia?

09:50.465 --> 09:53.050
- Gaia. Gaia.
- (laughing)

09:53.218 --> 09:55.678
Will you come to Capua
without telling me?

09:55.845 --> 09:57.888
I have only
this moment returned,

09:58.056 --> 09:59.807
with intentions
of seeking you out.

09:59.975 --> 10:01.475
Do you travel
with your husband?

10:01.643 --> 10:04.895
He takes to road no more,

10:05.063 --> 10:06.939
not in this life at least.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.482
Apologies.

10:08.650 --> 10:11.360
None required.
It was his time.

10:13.029 --> 10:14.989
Are you occupied?

10:15.156 --> 10:17.741
I'm fit to bursting
with stories of my adventures.

10:17.909 --> 10:19.702
Quintus?

10:19.869 --> 10:21.954
What man dares stand
between women and gossip?

10:22.122 --> 10:25.040
You must tell me everything.
Secret no detail.

10:25.208 --> 10:28.585
Removed from the ears of men,
my lips willingly part.

10:28.753 --> 10:31.171
Gaia returns unencumbered

10:31.339 --> 10:33.924
and in enticing form.

10:34.092 --> 10:37.803
Huh, that woman is
a force of fucking nature,

10:37.971 --> 10:40.889
one that has blown many
an unsuspecting man to his ruin.

10:41.057 --> 10:42.683
You require someone
more refined

10:42.851 --> 10:45.728
to grace arm
as our fortunes rise.

10:48.106 --> 10:50.065
Have eyes ever beheld
such a marvel?

10:50.233 --> 10:54.445
A sight to put the Circus Maximus
in Rome to bitter shame.

10:54.612 --> 10:56.196
We will be the ones shamed

10:56.364 --> 10:59.533
if grand ceremony passes
absent our gladiators.

10:59.701 --> 11:02.453
We must force advantage
before opportunity slips from grasp.

11:02.620 --> 11:04.288
No, we must be patient.

11:04.456 --> 11:06.874
Your father would venture forth
with respect and caution.

11:07.042 --> 11:09.001
Then a blessing
he is not present.

11:09.169 --> 11:12.379
Perhaps we should send word
to him in Sicilia, petition advice?

11:12.547 --> 11:14.506
I can already divine
the content of his reply,

11:14.674 --> 11:17.593
which is why he never rose
above his humble station.

11:17.761 --> 11:20.429
Fuck patience.

11:20.597 --> 11:22.598
Look to Tullius for the way.

11:22.766 --> 11:24.516
He seizes opportunity
by the balls

11:24.684 --> 11:26.977
while lesser men
are left holding cock.

11:27.145 --> 11:29.188
A simple merchant,

11:29.356 --> 11:31.982
yet he gives honored counsel
to the magistrate

11:32.150 --> 11:34.276
and all the rest of the noble
shit-eaters of Capua.

11:34.444 --> 11:37.696
Truth told,
yet at excessive volume.

11:37.864 --> 11:39.907
I would shout his praise
to the fucking heavens.

11:40.075 --> 11:41.575
His hands shaped events

11:41.743 --> 11:43.744
resulting in the erection
of the new arena.

11:43.912 --> 11:45.829
He supplies slaves

11:45.997 --> 11:48.582
from the farthest reaches of
the Republic to speed its completion.

11:48.750 --> 11:50.959
Through the ambitions
of Tullius,

11:51.127 --> 11:53.087
Capua is elevated...

11:53.254 --> 11:56.673
a lesson to be studied
and reproduced in kind.

11:56.841 --> 12:01.011
Is that all?
A simple task then, Batiatus.

12:03.181 --> 12:04.890
- Slave: Dominus.
- Between us,

12:05.058 --> 12:07.351
we have the greatest
gladiators in Capua...

12:07.519 --> 12:10.938
Barca, Acadeus, Gannicus...

12:11.106 --> 12:13.357
men forged into something
beyond their worth,

12:13.525 --> 12:16.527
beyond anything that smug
little piss Vettius

12:16.694 --> 12:18.362
could ever hope to offer.

12:18.530 --> 12:20.197
(men grunting)

12:23.076 --> 12:24.660
Perhaps Tullius
should not have strayed

12:24.828 --> 12:26.995
so far abroad
in acquiring his slaves.

12:27.163 --> 12:28.163
Man: What's he doing?

12:28.331 --> 12:30.874
Pick him up.

12:32.127 --> 12:34.294
Crixus,

12:34.462 --> 12:36.463
you know the rules...

12:36.631 --> 12:39.091
no one breaks the line.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.259
Quintus: Hold.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.219
Is this one
of good Tullius's slaves?

12:42.387 --> 12:43.637
It is.

12:43.805 --> 12:45.556
- I would make purchase.
- Purchase?

12:45.723 --> 12:48.725
- What's the man's worth?
- He is not for sale.

12:48.893 --> 12:50.436
50 denarii.

12:50.603 --> 12:53.063
- What are you doing?
- Seizing balls.

12:53.231 --> 12:54.440
The man is barely worth 10.

12:54.607 --> 12:57.109
Why would you pay
such a sum for a shit Gaul?

12:57.277 --> 12:58.527
Shit?

12:58.695 --> 13:00.404
Do you not see
the promise in his eyes,

13:00.572 --> 13:02.948
the spark smoldering
in his breast?

13:03.116 --> 13:05.325
I would give it tender,
to ignite in the arena.

13:07.996 --> 13:09.037
50.

13:09.205 --> 13:11.206
Add another five
to weight your own purse.

13:11.374 --> 13:13.959
Lend me 20 denarii.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.420
You pay too much for the man.

13:16.588 --> 13:18.005
Quintus:
The man is nothing.

13:18.173 --> 13:20.757
I pay to gain favor
with Tullius.

13:23.595 --> 13:25.179
A waste of coin.

13:25.346 --> 13:28.307
The shit fuck
will never be a gladiator.

13:28.475 --> 13:32.060
Quintus: Even the lowest man
can rise beyond the heavens,

13:32.228 --> 13:35.272
if tempted
with the proper reward.

13:55.960 --> 13:58.003
(grunting)

15:07.949 --> 15:10.492
(women laughing)

15:14.414 --> 15:16.164
He was well satisfied?

15:16.332 --> 15:17.874
Very well.

15:18.042 --> 15:19.918
Dominus will be pleased.

15:20.086 --> 15:21.962
Not as much as I am.

15:22.130 --> 15:25.090
When are you not so,
especially with yourself?

15:25.258 --> 15:26.800
It is a curse,

15:26.968 --> 15:29.011
being blessed
with so much to offer.

15:29.178 --> 15:31.847
And so few interested
in sharing it.

15:32.015 --> 15:34.141
(laughs)

15:38.146 --> 15:40.606
See yourselves well scrubbed.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.733
I would not
have you smell of goat.

15:42.900 --> 15:44.693
Goat?

15:44.861 --> 15:46.278
A dead one.

15:46.446 --> 15:50.240
(laughs)
The smell of victory, brother.

15:50.408 --> 15:51.575
Well-earned.

15:51.743 --> 15:53.243
The men all speak
of your triumph.

15:53.411 --> 15:55.996
As they will of yours,
when you return to the arena.

15:56.164 --> 15:58.874
The crowd will come
in great geysers,

15:59.042 --> 16:01.918
drenching the gods
gathered to witness

16:02.086 --> 16:04.588
Oenomaus once more
upon the sands.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.591
I would have words
with my wife,

16:07.759 --> 16:10.802
absent your cock,
which has escaped you.

16:12.680 --> 16:15.057
It will be missed.

16:18.436 --> 16:19.978
Has Dominus spoken
of my return?

16:20.146 --> 16:21.772
I have not heard it.

16:21.939 --> 16:23.982
More than a year has passed
since I faced Theokoles.

16:24.150 --> 16:25.859
Perhaps Dominus
does not intend...

16:26.027 --> 16:27.736
You were the only one
to ever stand

16:27.904 --> 16:29.571
against the Shadow of Death
and live.

16:29.739 --> 16:31.823
Batiatus would be a fool
to keep you from the arena.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.909
Or I am the fool

16:34.077 --> 16:35.869
for ever dreaming
of such a thing.

16:36.037 --> 16:38.830
You are many things.
Foolish is not among them.

16:38.998 --> 16:41.124
Batiatus waits
but for the perfect day

16:41.292 --> 16:43.418
for his champion
to retake glory.

16:53.680 --> 16:57.140
Is it true that his thing is
as large as a horse's?

16:57.308 --> 16:58.600
Diona!

16:58.768 --> 16:59.851
Are you not curious?

17:00.019 --> 17:01.895
Is Gannicus really that big?

17:02.063 --> 17:03.647
(laughing)

17:03.815 --> 17:05.398
Where is Domina?

17:05.566 --> 17:07.442
In the triclinium with her guest.

17:07.609 --> 17:09.736
Diona, see the girls bathed.

17:09.904 --> 17:11.279
Yes, Melitta.

17:14.032 --> 17:17.868
It is exciting
speaking of such things, is it not?

17:18.037 --> 17:20.830
I was of a similar age
not so long ago.

17:20.998 --> 17:23.583
I know the giddy enticement
of the subject.

17:23.751 --> 17:26.837
Yet you and Diona
should turn thought from it.

17:27.003 --> 17:29.840
Soon enough your flowers
will be plucked.

17:30.007 --> 17:32.134
Hastening the moment
will only result

17:32.301 --> 17:34.469
in bruising of the petals.

17:34.637 --> 17:36.638
Yes, Melitta.

17:38.224 --> 17:40.183
And in regards to Gannicus,

17:40.351 --> 17:42.477
I've seen bigger.

17:44.313 --> 17:47.858
Well, you don't seem overly
distraught at his passing.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.777
How would you present,

17:50.945 --> 17:53.780
after years enduring
withered flesh groping at you?

17:53.948 --> 17:56.742
But when you left Capua
I thought you madly in love.

17:56.909 --> 18:00.036
I was... with his purse.

18:01.122 --> 18:04.708
Sadly his fortunes went dry
towards the end.

18:04.876 --> 18:09.004
And did you aid
in their evaporation?

18:09.172 --> 18:11.006
What can I say?

18:11.174 --> 18:13.467
I am the glorious sun...

18:15.011 --> 18:17.220
returned to bless loving rays

18:17.388 --> 18:19.890
upon favored friend.

18:20.057 --> 18:22.976
(Lucretia gasps)
Gaia.

18:23.144 --> 18:26.021
I have far too many baubles
brought from Rome,

18:26.189 --> 18:29.816
along with other pleasures
to be shared.

18:41.078 --> 18:42.996
It suits you.

18:43.164 --> 18:46.082
It would dazzle Venus herself.

18:48.628 --> 18:51.671
I fear I have nothing
so exquisite to give in return.

18:51.839 --> 18:54.841
Your company
is all I ever desire.

18:57.261 --> 18:59.054
And?

18:59.222 --> 19:02.265
And I would not refuse the comforts
of a well-appointed villa

19:02.433 --> 19:04.976
until I manage
other arrangements.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.229
Involving a ripe purse?

19:07.396 --> 19:09.397
(laughs)

19:09.565 --> 19:11.399
I shall ask Quintus
when he returns.

19:11.567 --> 19:13.360
Ask?

19:13.528 --> 19:16.279
Women do not ask
their husbands for permission.

19:16.447 --> 19:19.241
They maneuver them
to proper answer

19:19.408 --> 19:21.701
before question
is ever put to tongue.

19:21.869 --> 19:23.537
Oh, Gaia.

19:23.704 --> 19:26.665
So many years have passed,
and yet nothing has changed.

19:28.209 --> 19:31.711
Everything has changed,

19:31.879 --> 19:34.047
and for the better,
by the judging of it.

19:35.758 --> 19:37.801
When last we parted,

19:37.969 --> 19:40.095
this house was but a tomb

19:40.263 --> 19:43.974
haunted by the living specter
of your husband's father

19:44.141 --> 19:47.060
and you,
forced to smile and cater,

19:47.228 --> 19:50.230
bringing him his
honeyed wine every evening.

19:50.398 --> 19:51.982
I thought the crusty
old bastard

19:52.149 --> 19:53.900
would never succumb
to the afterlife.

19:54.068 --> 19:56.152
He is not yet so far removed,

19:56.320 --> 19:58.446
merely retired to Sicilia
for his health.

19:58.614 --> 20:01.992
So he yet controls the ludus?

20:02.159 --> 20:04.703
No. My husband does

20:04.871 --> 20:06.746
as his proxy.

20:06.914 --> 20:08.999
Was Gannicus
well-attended then?

20:09.166 --> 20:11.001
He was, Domina.

20:11.168 --> 20:12.502
Gannicus?

20:12.670 --> 20:15.005
That Celt

20:15.172 --> 20:19.009
with the ridiculously
charming smile?

20:19.176 --> 20:21.052
He has risen to prominence
in the ludus

20:21.220 --> 20:23.513
ever since Oenomaus was
injured against Theokoles...

20:25.224 --> 20:27.017
In an amazing display
of bravery.

20:27.184 --> 20:31.104
Gaia:
Gannicus, Oenomaus...

20:31.272 --> 20:34.983
all the hard, rippling men
right beneath our feet.

20:35.151 --> 20:38.069
One moistens at the thought.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.906
Gaia. They are but slaves.

20:41.073 --> 20:42.532
Please.

20:42.700 --> 20:45.702
In all the years
you've called this ludus home,

20:45.870 --> 20:48.371
you've never once considered
fucking one of them?

20:49.916 --> 20:53.376
The very thought of that
turns my stomach.

20:53.544 --> 20:56.630
I would never lay with any man
besides my husband,

20:56.797 --> 20:59.758
let alone a filthy gladiator.

21:03.429 --> 21:05.472
Man: Fucking Gaul.

21:05.640 --> 21:08.934
Ashur: Another sacrifice
to the gods of the arena.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.729
(speaks foreign language)

21:14.607 --> 21:16.274
Dagan thinks you of a form,

21:16.442 --> 21:18.360
giving odds in your favor.

21:18.527 --> 21:20.320
Odds?

21:20.488 --> 21:22.030
Do you know
where you are, friend?

21:22.198 --> 21:24.991
The House of Batiatus,
trainer of gladiators.

21:25.159 --> 21:28.870
Yes. You stand among
his latest recruits.

21:29.038 --> 21:30.997
Bound by pain and blood,

21:31.165 --> 21:33.458
together we toil
beneath the cruel sting

21:33.626 --> 21:35.293
of Doctore's whip.

21:35.461 --> 21:37.295
There were eight of us
when training began.

21:37.463 --> 21:39.631
Now we're but three.

21:39.799 --> 21:41.424
Four.

21:47.390 --> 21:50.433
And how are we so blessed
by a swelling number, hmm?

21:51.477 --> 21:54.562
By what means do you find yourself
among such storied company?

21:54.730 --> 21:56.940
My own.

21:57.108 --> 22:00.485
I was bound to Appius the slaver,

22:00.653 --> 22:04.239
carrying stone toward purpose
at the new arena.

22:04.407 --> 22:09.244
I saw Batiatus and knew him
by his words of gladiators.

22:11.288 --> 22:13.498
So I gained his attention.

22:13.666 --> 22:15.917
You willingly present ass
for fucking?

22:16.085 --> 22:18.044
No.

22:18.212 --> 22:20.422
No, young Indus.

22:20.589 --> 22:23.049
Do you not see it in his eyes?

22:24.927 --> 22:28.930
This is a man with dreams
of blood and glory.

22:29.098 --> 22:30.974
I doubt he'll live to see the test.

22:31.142 --> 22:32.559
Test?

22:32.727 --> 22:34.269
Ashur: Our last trial.

22:34.437 --> 22:36.771
We must all face
one of the seasoned men

22:36.939 --> 22:39.524
and demonstrate to the dominus
what we have learned.

22:39.692 --> 22:43.278
Live, and receive
the mark of the Brotherhood,

22:43.446 --> 22:46.114
proving yourself
worthy of the arena.

22:46.282 --> 22:49.159
I will stand upon its sands.

22:49.326 --> 22:51.202
(speaking foreign language)

22:55.374 --> 22:57.709
Oh, he longs to call you brother

22:57.877 --> 23:00.003
and join you as gladiator.

23:00.171 --> 23:01.963
(laughs)

23:02.131 --> 23:06.134
Tell him the feeling
is well shared.

23:07.136 --> 23:10.889
Quintus:
Oh, Jupiter's cock.

23:11.057 --> 23:13.641
50 denarii

23:13.809 --> 23:15.894
for a fucking stone hauler.

23:16.062 --> 23:17.937
Lucretia:
Coin well spent.

23:19.440 --> 23:21.357
Was it?

23:21.525 --> 23:23.610
Word surely has reached
Tullius's ear,

23:23.778 --> 23:25.528
yet none of gratitude return.

23:25.696 --> 23:28.323
50 denarii.

23:28.491 --> 23:30.158
Solonius was right.

23:30.326 --> 23:32.410
I should temper patience
as my father would.

23:32.578 --> 23:35.705
You're not your father,

23:35.873 --> 23:38.249
nor would I have it so.

23:40.086 --> 23:43.004
Perhaps tomorrow you will find
yourself in the market,

23:43.172 --> 23:44.923
where, you have
often mentioned,

23:45.091 --> 23:47.050
Tullius frequents
upon a certain hour

23:47.218 --> 23:49.177
overseeing his concerns.

23:49.345 --> 23:51.304
A chance encounter
to gauge reaction?

23:51.472 --> 23:54.015
Lucretia:
Certain to be favorable,

23:54.183 --> 23:57.685
as I know your reply
to my request will be.

23:59.105 --> 24:01.022
Give it voice
and see it considered.

24:01.190 --> 24:04.734
I would have Gaia
remain with us,

24:04.902 --> 24:06.194
just for a few days,

24:06.362 --> 24:08.363
until she can manage
other arrangements.

24:08.531 --> 24:09.989
The request does not surprise.

24:10.157 --> 24:12.408
Is that a yes?

24:12.576 --> 24:15.453
Ask for the moon and I would
wrest it from the heavens.

24:15.621 --> 24:17.997
Gaia will be so pleased
at your answer.

24:19.166 --> 24:23.002
Let her keep company
with her wine a moment longer.

24:26.882 --> 24:29.634
Has a wife ever had
such a husband?

24:29.802 --> 24:31.928
He but honors her

24:32.096 --> 24:35.431
and the gods
for guiding her to his arms.

25:17.266 --> 25:20.393
(men grunting)

25:35.492 --> 25:36.576
(laughs)

25:36.744 --> 25:39.245
Crixus, you lower your shield
when you thrust.

25:39.413 --> 25:43.291
See it raised, or your fucking
brains on the sand.

25:43.459 --> 25:45.043
Yes, Doctore.

25:47.296 --> 25:48.296
A lucky blow.

25:48.464 --> 25:51.591
A blow well-struck.
I will not make the same mistake.

25:57.264 --> 25:58.932
Ha ha! Good.

25:59.099 --> 26:00.725
Again.

26:07.024 --> 26:09.359
Doctore.

26:09.526 --> 26:11.945
I would work the palus
in the shade.

26:15.282 --> 26:17.158
I would not let gaze linger.

26:17.326 --> 26:19.577
Gannicus is a fucking fool,
yet one of deadly skill.

26:19.745 --> 26:23.373
He's often rewarded
for his victories with wine and cunt.

26:23.540 --> 26:25.124
Gain Dominus's favor,

26:25.292 --> 26:27.252
and such delights
could be yours.

26:31.090 --> 26:34.008
Drink and women
are not my concern.

26:34.176 --> 26:36.344
Ah, more for me then.

26:38.430 --> 26:40.556
Fucking recruits...

26:40.724 --> 26:43.643
smaller and smaller each year.

26:46.647 --> 26:48.648
Apologies.

26:57.491 --> 26:59.284
Oenomaus,

26:59.451 --> 27:02.495
you return to form.

27:02.663 --> 27:04.872
Pair with Crixus
and bring him up to speed.

27:07.459 --> 27:08.793
Dominus.

27:20.264 --> 27:22.974
Gratitude for your instructions.

27:26.395 --> 27:28.354
Lesson one...

27:28.522 --> 27:30.857
never drop your fucking guard.

27:34.278 --> 27:35.945
Do you lay eyes?

27:36.113 --> 27:37.864
No. Perhaps Tullius
did not come today.

27:38.032 --> 27:39.115
He always arrives,

27:39.283 --> 27:41.034
and seldom departs
before noonday sun.

27:41.201 --> 27:43.703
Are you his shadow now,
adhered to each footstep?

27:43.871 --> 27:45.997
I but study my subject,
as any proper student would

27:46.165 --> 27:48.249
in the pursuit of knowledge.

27:48.417 --> 27:50.293
Tullius' man.

27:51.337 --> 27:53.671
I seek your master... good Tullius.
Would he be within?

27:53.839 --> 27:56.090
Yeah.

27:56.258 --> 27:57.925
I wish to express
my gratitude

27:58.093 --> 28:00.178
for allowing me to purchase
his slave Crixus.

28:00.346 --> 28:03.765
The Gaul shows great promise
towards the arena.

28:03.932 --> 28:07.935
Perhaps you could pass
word of my presence.

28:12.816 --> 28:14.942
You owe me a few of those,
if you recall.

28:15.110 --> 28:18.154
A costly enterprise
for us both.

28:18.322 --> 28:20.114
That one prays will turn profit.

28:20.282 --> 28:22.575
(pigs squealing,
sheep bleating)

28:22.743 --> 28:24.827
Good Batiatus.

28:24.995 --> 28:26.829
The gods answer.

28:29.166 --> 28:30.458
In mocking tone.

28:30.626 --> 28:32.543
Tullius: I hoped for occasion
to give gratitude

28:32.711 --> 28:34.587
for relieving me
of that troublesome Gaul.

28:34.755 --> 28:35.963
Think nothing of it...

28:36.131 --> 28:38.299
a gesture of respect
for a man deserving of it.

28:38.467 --> 28:40.134
Received with all intentions.

28:40.302 --> 28:42.512
Yet I fear you have overpaid.

28:42.679 --> 28:45.973
A common mistake for those
with no head towards business.

28:46.975 --> 28:50.895
50 denarii, minus the 10
of the Gaul's actual worth.

28:51.063 --> 28:52.230
Well...

28:52.398 --> 28:55.400
I do not ask for its return.
Fair bargain was struck.

28:55.567 --> 28:57.693
Fair?
A clumsy maneuver

28:57.861 --> 28:59.529
to gain position
for your ill-trained men.

28:59.696 --> 29:01.572
- Vettius.
- Ill-trained?

29:01.740 --> 29:04.242
Any one of my men could
best yours fucking blindfolded,

29:04.410 --> 29:05.910
you pissy little shit.

29:06.078 --> 29:08.121
- Listen how the rooster crows.
- Let us calm ourselves.

29:08.288 --> 29:10.248
You doubt my words?
Test them.

29:10.416 --> 29:13.334
Request the match
in the next month's games.

29:13.502 --> 29:16.254
Why delay?
Let us see it here in the morning,

29:16.422 --> 29:18.506
the people to judge
who holds the better man.

29:18.674 --> 29:20.967
In the market?
Surely the magistrate

29:21.135 --> 29:23.136
would not approve
such disruption.

29:23.303 --> 29:25.263
Good Tullius has his ear.

29:25.431 --> 29:27.265
The magistrate could be
swayed to allow it,

29:27.433 --> 29:29.183
if that is what you wish.

29:29.351 --> 29:32.311
It is, and long past due.

29:32.479 --> 29:34.605
Tomorrow then.

29:34.773 --> 29:38.317
A friendly rivalry
well-settled.

29:40.737 --> 29:42.363
You press beyond advantage.

29:42.531 --> 29:46.033
No, I fucking press towards it.

29:47.077 --> 29:48.953
You should have seen
young Vettius,

29:49.121 --> 29:51.456
so easily goaded
into making challenge,

29:51.623 --> 29:53.291
the fucking child.

29:53.459 --> 29:56.210
All men are reduced in years
when faced with superior mind.

29:56.378 --> 29:57.879
Superior in all accounting...

29:58.046 --> 29:59.547
a fact Tullius
and the rest of the city

29:59.715 --> 30:01.132
will bear witness to
in the marketplace.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.384
Sleep will come
with difficulty tonight.

30:03.552 --> 30:05.887
It's been ages
since I've seen a decent match

30:06.054 --> 30:08.556
or Tullius.
In the blush of youth,

30:08.724 --> 30:10.892
he was forever attempting
to slip beneath my robes.

30:11.059 --> 30:13.728
Ha! You should have
fucking let him.

30:13.896 --> 30:15.771
Tullius has grown
to be a man of worth,

30:15.939 --> 30:18.816
one to be emulated and admired.

30:18.984 --> 30:21.402
And who will you choose
to impress him?

30:21.570 --> 30:24.363
Vettius's foolishness
presents rare opportunity.

30:24.531 --> 30:28.367
The question begs
careful consideration.

30:35.167 --> 30:37.251
I have news to lift the heart.

30:37.419 --> 30:39.378
Vettius has made challenge.

30:39.546 --> 30:43.257
- The coward finds his cock.
- And I would see it shriveled.

30:43.425 --> 30:45.968
My best man is to meet his dog
in the marketplace come morning.

30:46.136 --> 30:47.595
The market?

30:47.763 --> 30:49.430
Eh, detail of no consequence.

30:49.598 --> 30:51.265
My question to you is plain...

30:51.433 --> 30:54.185
is our man prepared
for such a vital match?

30:56.605 --> 30:57.730
Yes, Dominus.

30:57.898 --> 31:00.441
I long to honor
this house once again.

31:02.528 --> 31:05.154
I fear you have
mistaken intentions.

31:05.322 --> 31:07.323
I speak of Gannicus.

31:10.953 --> 31:13.454
Gannicus?

31:16.041 --> 31:18.334
The question is better put
to Doctore.

31:20.337 --> 31:21.921
Leave.

31:23.840 --> 31:27.260
His counsel is always valued,

31:27.427 --> 31:30.388
yet he is my father's man,

31:30.556 --> 31:32.431
his judgment clouded

31:32.599 --> 31:34.475
through a haze
of outdated traditions.

31:34.643 --> 31:37.478
I seek a more visceral
assessment.

31:37.646 --> 31:39.772
You and I practically
grew up together in this ludus.

31:39.940 --> 31:44.068
You have witnessed the rise
and fall of a dozen champions.

31:44.236 --> 31:48.364
What now does your gut
tell you of Gannicus?

31:48.532 --> 31:51.200
Is he worthy of the mantle?

31:53.912 --> 31:55.329
I believe it so.

31:57.416 --> 31:59.417
He must truly be,
for you to offer support

31:59.585 --> 32:02.503
despite your own desires.

32:02.671 --> 32:05.923
I would not give false tongue
to gain advantage.

32:07.301 --> 32:09.844
There are few
that would stand with you so.

32:10.012 --> 32:12.054
Your wife's weekly visit...
two nights hence?

32:12.222 --> 32:13.889
Yes, Dominus.

32:14.057 --> 32:15.766
I would see her to your bed
tonight as well

32:15.934 --> 32:18.352
in gratitude
for honest thoughts.

32:18.520 --> 32:20.771
Dominus.

32:26.612 --> 32:29.071
Oenomaus: Do the gods
ever answer your prayers?

32:29.239 --> 32:31.657
They often reveal
their leanings,

32:31.825 --> 32:34.619
though not in words...
much like my husband.

32:36.747 --> 32:40.374
Dominus summoned me
to ask of Gannicus.

32:40.542 --> 32:42.668
Gannicus?

32:42.836 --> 32:45.421
He has chosen him
as champion.

32:45.589 --> 32:50.092
He is to face Vettius's man
in the marketplace tomorrow.

32:50.260 --> 32:52.803
And this is why you sulk?

32:52.971 --> 32:54.555
The streets are no place

32:54.723 --> 32:57.516
for the mighty Oenomaus
to make his return.

32:57.684 --> 32:59.894
The arena will be home
to your triumphs

33:00.062 --> 33:01.729
when the time comes.

33:01.897 --> 33:04.899
And I will be there
to witness it.

33:44.606 --> 33:46.524
I will dream of your touch.

33:46.692 --> 33:50.319
As I dream of yours every night.

34:01.873 --> 34:05.626
Gannicus: ♪ Blood rains down
from an angry sky ♪

34:05.794 --> 34:09.922
♪ My cock rages on,
my cock rages on ♪

34:10.090 --> 34:13.884
♪ Blood rains down
from an angry sky ♪

34:14.052 --> 34:17.763
♪ My cock rages on,
my cock rages on. ♪

34:17.931 --> 34:19.473
Gannicus.

34:19.641 --> 34:22.810
Brother. Brother,
come drink, join me.

34:22.978 --> 34:25.521
Lower voice.
If the guards were to hear you...

34:25.688 --> 34:28.524
The guards have already passed
and were well plied with wine

34:28.692 --> 34:31.025
to keep nose
from fucking business.

34:31.194 --> 34:33.446
Tomorrow you fight
for the honor of this ludus.

34:33.612 --> 34:35.197
Now is not the time for drink.

34:35.364 --> 34:37.949
Every night is a time for drink,

34:38.118 --> 34:41.579
for the morning sun
may greet you

34:41.746 --> 34:43.706
with your last

34:43.873 --> 34:46.333
fucking day.

34:46.501 --> 34:48.753
(laughing)

34:52.215 --> 34:54.216
Fall to your bed,

34:54.384 --> 34:56.802
or risk steeper plummet
against Vettius's man.

34:56.969 --> 34:59.597
Words of wisdom
well-received,

34:59.765 --> 35:01.932
well... well-received.

35:05.395 --> 35:06.604
Oenomaus.

35:09.316 --> 35:11.817
It should be you tomorrow.

35:22.996 --> 35:25.206
Where is good Vettius?

35:25.373 --> 35:26.582
Is he among you?

35:26.750 --> 35:28.375
Or did he come to his sense

35:28.543 --> 35:31.128
and remain within the warm safety
of his bed?

35:31.296 --> 35:33.339
Ah, there he stands,

35:33.507 --> 35:35.424
fresh and young
as a newborn calf.

35:35.592 --> 35:37.885
The fool at last shows himself.

35:38.053 --> 35:39.428
Batiatus.

35:39.596 --> 35:41.764
We had begun to fret
on your arrival,

35:41.932 --> 35:44.975
although I see you arrive
with unexpected gift.

35:46.353 --> 35:48.604
It has been too long, Gaia.

35:48.772 --> 35:49.897
And grows longer still.

35:50.065 --> 35:51.649
Apologies for my delay.

35:51.817 --> 35:55.486
I had much difficulty
in the choosing of a man...

35:55.654 --> 35:57.738
an imposing task,

35:57.906 --> 35:59.740
when each among my stable
stands a titan.

35:59.908 --> 36:02.535
Perhaps young Vettius

36:02.702 --> 36:04.870
should have taken more time
with the choosing of his own.

36:05.038 --> 36:08.499
Words fall from your mouth
as shit from ass.

36:08.667 --> 36:12.378
Let us not become mired
in base exchange.

36:13.547 --> 36:15.714
We are gathered
this glorious day

36:15.882 --> 36:18.676
to witness honorable contest

36:18.844 --> 36:21.846
between respected rivals.

36:22.013 --> 36:23.764
Clear space!

36:26.935 --> 36:29.228
The years have favored Tullius.

36:29.396 --> 36:31.272
And his purse.

36:31.439 --> 36:34.608
A brawl in the streets?
Where is the honor in such a thing?

36:34.776 --> 36:37.862
Fuck honor.
This is business.

36:38.029 --> 36:41.031
Gratitude to Magistrate Sextus...

36:41.199 --> 36:43.409
The event turns
larger than expected.

36:43.577 --> 36:46.203
- Your mad schemes may yet bear fruit.
- For allowing such thrilling event...

36:46.371 --> 36:48.247
Enough for both of us
to feast upon.

36:48.415 --> 36:50.916
...in the streets
of the great city of Capua!

36:54.504 --> 36:56.797
Batiatus, present your man.

36:56.965 --> 37:00.175
In honor of the magistrate,

37:00.343 --> 37:02.428
esteemed Tullius

37:02.596 --> 37:04.722
and the good people of Capua,

37:04.890 --> 37:07.641
I give you the fiercest Celt

37:07.809 --> 37:10.644
ever to take up arms
in the arena,

37:10.812 --> 37:13.731
slayer of beasts,

37:13.899 --> 37:16.525
conqueror of giants.

37:16.693 --> 37:19.028
Behold Gannicus,

37:19.195 --> 37:21.864
Champion of
the House of Batiatus!

37:22.032 --> 37:24.033
Arghh!

37:29.205 --> 37:31.832
A fine choice.

37:32.000 --> 37:34.752
Vettius, present your man.

37:34.920 --> 37:37.588
I have no tongue
for overripe embellishment,

37:37.756 --> 37:39.506
nor is it required.

37:39.674 --> 37:41.800
Otho, stand forth.

37:43.637 --> 37:45.721
(roars)

37:48.683 --> 37:50.809
Your day finally comes.

37:50.977 --> 37:52.645
And yours ends.

37:52.812 --> 37:56.649
Gratitude to Batiatus and Vettius.

37:56.816 --> 38:01.236
Now let us judge
who stands the better house.

38:07.118 --> 38:08.911
Apologies, Magistrate.

38:09.913 --> 38:12.706
There appears to be
something missing.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.335
Where is your man's blindfold?

38:16.503 --> 38:18.212
(crowd muttering)

38:18.380 --> 38:20.381
Blindfold? What the fuck?

38:22.008 --> 38:24.802
That was your boast,
was it not...

38:27.263 --> 38:30.766
that your gladiator could best
any of my men

38:30.934 --> 38:32.893
absent sight?

38:37.691 --> 38:40.275
You did voice such challenge.

38:40.443 --> 38:43.112
A simple figure of speech,
not meant to be...

38:43.279 --> 38:44.571
good Tullius...

38:44.739 --> 38:46.782
If Batiatus does not wish
to honor terms,

38:46.950 --> 38:51.328
he should remove himself
with tail between legs.

39:02.465 --> 39:04.717
Doctore.

39:06.761 --> 39:08.262
Come.

39:09.806 --> 39:12.182
The task should not be
that difficult.

39:12.350 --> 39:15.686
I need only direct my blades
towards the smell of shit.

39:16.980 --> 39:20.274
Gannicus, ever the fool.

39:27.949 --> 39:30.534
Are you going to
allow this, Quintus?

39:30.702 --> 39:32.995
The choice has been
removed from my hands.

39:37.333 --> 39:38.834
Begin.

39:39.002 --> 39:41.003
(yelling)

40:02.108 --> 40:03.984
Yes!

40:12.911 --> 40:14.661
How thrilling.

40:14.829 --> 40:16.705
I have never seen
such a thing.

40:16.873 --> 40:17.956
For good reason.

40:48.029 --> 40:49.988
A noble attempt.

40:50.156 --> 40:52.324
To be remembered
only in its failing.

41:24.566 --> 41:27.025
Get up!

41:32.615 --> 41:33.824
Yes.

41:35.118 --> 41:36.201
Get up.

41:46.212 --> 41:47.212
Yes!

41:54.137 --> 41:55.637
Fucking kill him!

41:59.058 --> 42:00.392
Yes!

42:15.074 --> 42:18.785
Have you ever
fucking seen the like?

42:20.246 --> 42:24.750
Perhaps good Vettius should pit
a man less prone to death

42:24.918 --> 42:26.960
against the mighty Gannicus.

42:27.128 --> 42:28.837
An impressive display,
Batiatus,

42:29.005 --> 42:30.380
one not soon forgotten.

42:31.591 --> 42:34.301
Gannicus is truly a wonder.

42:34.469 --> 42:37.429
One deserving more prominent
position in the games.

42:37.597 --> 42:39.681
You gaze upon
my very thoughts.

42:39.849 --> 42:41.892
Commitments beckon.

42:42.060 --> 42:44.228
Join me at Nestor's shop
after the market closes

42:44.395 --> 42:46.605
and we shall discuss
your man at length.

43:02.664 --> 43:07.000
Only mad Gannicus could
win contest fucking blindfolded.

43:07.168 --> 43:09.544
Barca could do the same.

43:09.712 --> 43:12.798
And I would kill you
for being a fool.

43:12.966 --> 43:14.967
Oenomaus:
Auctus speaks truth.

43:15.134 --> 43:19.388
Facing Vettius's man absent sight
was beyond foolish.

43:19.555 --> 43:23.475
The gods must have taken pity
on your addled brain.

43:23.643 --> 43:26.144
The gods had naught
to do with it.

43:26.312 --> 43:29.898
Otho... he grunts like a stuck pig
before each attack.

43:30.066 --> 43:33.068
His squeals...
they gave away position.

43:33.236 --> 43:34.528
(laughing)

43:34.696 --> 43:36.321
Your victory lifts the heart.

43:36.489 --> 43:40.242
You will not be rid
of Gannicus so easily, brother.

43:41.953 --> 43:46.164
Dominus... he rewards me
with all the wine that I can drink.

43:46.332 --> 43:48.875
And I would share it
with my brothers.

43:49.043 --> 43:51.420
(cheering)

43:51.587 --> 43:53.171
Those that bear the mark.

43:53.339 --> 43:55.257
(men laughing)

43:56.843 --> 43:58.635
One day.

44:00.763 --> 44:04.599
Gannicus' victory
forges path to greater glory.

44:04.767 --> 44:06.768
With Tullius's support,

44:06.936 --> 44:09.479
we can finally gain
proper position in games.

44:09.647 --> 44:12.190
Lucretia: Maybe a place in the opening
ceremony of the new arena.

44:12.358 --> 44:14.693
After such a magnificent showing,
I have no doubt

44:14.861 --> 44:17.404
Gannicus will be offered
a place in the primus.

44:17.572 --> 44:19.114
Primus?

44:19.282 --> 44:20.824
Yeah.

44:20.992 --> 44:23.618
I favor the fucking sound
of that.

44:25.330 --> 44:26.788
Expect late return.

44:26.956 --> 44:29.207
I would seek out
Solonius afterwards

44:29.375 --> 44:32.294
to discuss extending advantage
to his house as well.

44:34.255 --> 44:36.465
Send Tullius my regards

44:36.632 --> 44:39.843
and gauge his response
in remembering me.

44:40.011 --> 44:42.596
(laughs)
How could he fucking forget you?

44:46.267 --> 44:50.687
It staggers mind...
the change in him.

44:50.855 --> 44:52.314
Change?

44:52.482 --> 44:53.690
You know my meaning.

44:53.858 --> 44:57.277
He always seemed
so demure and cowed.

44:57.445 --> 44:59.196
And now he
positively burns.

44:59.364 --> 45:02.032
He has always done so.

45:02.200 --> 45:05.369
His light was merely muted
by the shadow of his father.

45:05.536 --> 45:08.747
The man could turn day to night
with disapproving frown.

45:10.917 --> 45:14.252
He never cared much for me

45:14.420 --> 45:18.632
or, I suspect, anything
that smacked of enjoyment.

45:21.302 --> 45:23.303
And what might this be?

45:23.471 --> 45:25.347
More gifts from Rome.

45:27.183 --> 45:29.184
The finest opium,

45:29.352 --> 45:31.728
carried from Cyprus.

45:34.482 --> 45:38.068
I have not partaken
in many years.

45:39.320 --> 45:40.529
My husband...

45:40.696 --> 45:42.906
Will be gone
most of the night.

45:49.455 --> 45:51.164
Good Batiatus.

45:51.332 --> 45:54.501
Word of Gannicus's victory
has spread throughout the city.

45:54.669 --> 45:57.838
His name, and yours,
fall from every mouth.

45:58.005 --> 46:01.466
May they always find
the taste pleasing.

46:01.634 --> 46:04.261
Everyone clamors
to see your man again,

46:04.429 --> 46:06.346
with exception of poor Vettius.

46:06.514 --> 46:08.140
He is fit for seizure
from the ordeal.

46:08.307 --> 46:10.475
Unfortunate that he
could not provide

46:10.643 --> 46:12.686
a more worthy opponent.

46:12.854 --> 46:14.938
His stock is well known
to be of inferior quality,

46:15.106 --> 46:16.690
as is the boy himself.

46:16.858 --> 46:18.608
The manner in which
he tends the ludus...

46:18.776 --> 46:21.278
the child has no fucking
talent for it.

46:22.321 --> 46:25.240
You surprise me, Batiatus.

46:25.408 --> 46:27.159
Your disposition
towards business

46:27.326 --> 46:29.995
is much more aggressive
than your father's.

46:30.163 --> 46:33.081
We are of diverging
temperament

46:33.249 --> 46:35.083
and desires.

46:36.127 --> 46:38.503
How does he fare in Sicilia?

46:38.671 --> 46:42.299
The clime is more agreeable
to various conditions

46:42.467 --> 46:44.759
brought about
by the passing of the years.

46:44.927 --> 46:48.138
How did the magistrate take
to Gannicus' display?

46:48.306 --> 46:52.017
Ignited by it,
as was the crowd.

46:52.185 --> 46:55.770
He even broached subject
of retaining the man

46:55.938 --> 46:57.355
for the opening games
of the new arena.

46:57.523 --> 47:02.277
Gannicus in the opening games?

47:02.445 --> 47:04.279
If you could aid
in such a thing,

47:04.447 --> 47:06.490
I would forever be
in your debt.

47:06.657 --> 47:09.284
It merely requires a word
in the proper ear.

47:09.452 --> 47:11.703
All that remains
is to agree upon a price.

47:11.871 --> 47:14.414
Well, of course

47:14.582 --> 47:16.291
I would be happy
to see coin to your hand

47:16.459 --> 47:18.460
in exchange for assistance.

47:18.628 --> 47:21.463
What sum
did you have in mind?

47:22.465 --> 47:24.341
(laughs)

47:24.509 --> 47:26.426
You misunderstand, Batiatus.

47:26.594 --> 47:28.428
I do not offer
to broker arrangement.

47:28.596 --> 47:31.097
I offer to purchase your man.

47:33.559 --> 47:35.143
Purchase?

47:35.311 --> 47:38.730
But why would you want a gladiator?
You're not a lanista.

47:38.898 --> 47:41.316
Jupiter's cock, no.

47:41.484 --> 47:43.443
Yet I have many
vested interests

47:43.611 --> 47:45.529
in shipping,
goods and services,

47:45.696 --> 47:47.572
this very shop

47:47.740 --> 47:51.243
and young Vettius's ludus.

47:55.581 --> 47:58.375
Vettius:
Look at the little fuck now,

47:58.543 --> 47:59.876
about to shit himself.

48:00.044 --> 48:01.586
Tullius:
Still your tongue.

48:01.754 --> 48:03.838
The grown-ups are talking.

48:06.676 --> 48:09.135
200 denarii...

48:09.303 --> 48:10.929
a generous offer

48:11.097 --> 48:13.807
in respect of your father.

48:13.975 --> 48:16.017
Apologies.

48:16.185 --> 48:18.353
I would not part with the man.

48:21.941 --> 48:24.234
I allow you

48:24.402 --> 48:26.486
to purchase
one of my slaves,

48:26.654 --> 48:28.738
yet now you deny me
the same opportunity?

48:28.906 --> 48:32.033
Gannicus is not for sale.

48:34.370 --> 48:37.414
Everything is for sale, Batiatus.

48:37.582 --> 48:39.624
The question is but price.

48:43.421 --> 48:46.006
(yelling)

48:51.470 --> 48:54.431
(Gaia laughing)

49:16.078 --> 49:18.455
(grunting)

49:55.451 --> 49:57.827
I make fair offer

49:57.995 --> 50:02.332
and you produce cock
to piss on me?

50:03.376 --> 50:06.503
Do you know what that
feels like, Batiatus?

50:13.928 --> 50:16.596
(chuckling)

50:26.732 --> 50:29.442
Reconsider your answer

50:29.610 --> 50:32.612
or be excluded
from the games forever.

50:40.871 --> 50:44.624
(Tullius laughs)

50:54.927 --> 50:57.137
(theme music playing)
