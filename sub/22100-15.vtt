01:28.589 --> 01:30.631
There. Attagirl.

01:30.716 --> 01:32.133
You just go to sleep.

01:32.259 --> 01:33.676
So sleepy...

01:34.052 --> 01:36.095
I'm so exhausted.

02:49.253 --> 02:51.462
Will you help me up, please?

02:53.674 --> 02:56.259
It's okay.
You can do that much.

03:12.067 --> 03:15.152
Thank you.
You're very kind.

03:30.168 --> 03:32.628
Among bright stars, I'm lost.

03:36.008 --> 03:39.260
You're not lost. I'm right
here. There's a new tide.

03:39.344 --> 03:41.721
And all the forgotten faces,
all the forgotten children,

03:41.805 --> 03:44.390
we seek the great
forgotten language.

03:47.394 --> 03:48.561
It's gonna be okay.

03:48.645 --> 03:49.812
We made it
through the mutiny.

03:49.897 --> 03:52.106
Not yet, he hasn't. He's
got a bullet in his brain.

03:52.190 --> 03:53.316
Then take out the bullet.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.692
We're lost because
the Colony never forgets.

03:54.776 --> 03:56.986
See that pale spot
over there?

03:57.279 --> 04:00.197
That's a massive hematoma
pressing on his brain.

04:00.282 --> 04:02.783
We got to drill holes
in his skull and drain it.

04:02.868 --> 04:03.993
Then when the swelling
goes down,

04:04.077 --> 04:06.913
I'll bring the brain guy over
from Inchon Velle,

04:06.997 --> 04:09.498
and we'll get a look and see
how we can get at that bullet.

04:09.583 --> 04:11.626
The mind is its own place.
Then get the brain guy.

04:11.710 --> 04:13.252
Get the frakking brain guy.

04:13.337 --> 04:15.338
We don't need a specialist
yet, Starbuck.

04:15.422 --> 04:16.422
I can drill.

04:16.506 --> 04:17.924
...and the hell of heaven.

04:18.008 --> 04:19.800
I'm right here, Sam.

He whose guile,

04:25.390 --> 04:27.433
stirred with revenge...
I'm right here, Sam.

I'm not gonna go anywhere.

04:31.063 --> 04:32.521
He's talking,
but he can't hear you.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.523
Just shut up and drill.

04:34.691 --> 04:38.277
And all the forgotten faces
we seek...

04:38.362 --> 04:39.403
(GRUNTS)

04:39.488 --> 04:40.696
STARBUCK: He's in pain.

04:40.781 --> 04:43.699
No, that's just a reflex.

04:53.543 --> 04:55.753
We've been to
that beach, too.

04:57.047 --> 04:59.298
Yes, we've been
to that beach.

05:00.634 --> 05:03.302
Sometimes Ellen
would be there, too.

05:03.679 --> 05:05.846
Because she loved the water.

05:09.476 --> 05:11.018
She loved the water.

05:28.036 --> 05:29.787
Hello, John.

05:30.122 --> 05:33.457
I don't care for that name.
I think you know that.

05:33.583 --> 05:35.876
I named you after my father.

05:35.961 --> 05:39.171
And you made me in his image.
Thanks a million for that.

05:39.256 --> 05:40.256
(CHUCKLES)

05:40.757 --> 05:44.093
I'd love a drink, John,
if it's not too much trouble.

05:44.177 --> 05:47.096
I take it you're here because
things didn't go very well down on

05:47.180 --> 05:49.515
New Caprica
with you and the mister.

05:49.599 --> 05:52.184
I betrayed the Resistance,
and he poisoned me.

05:52.269 --> 05:53.686
Nothing like true love.

05:53.770 --> 05:55.938
He did what he thought
was right.

05:56.023 --> 05:58.107
That's all any man can do.

05:58.608 --> 05:59.734
He's not a man.

05:59.818 --> 06:01.277
(CHUCKLES)

06:01.695 --> 06:05.197
As someone with first-hand
knowledge, I beg to differ.

06:06.700 --> 06:09.368
He's a machine.
So are you.

06:09.453 --> 06:11.954
I think that depends
on how you define things.

06:12.039 --> 06:14.874
Your ancestors didn't
crawl up out of the swamp.

06:14.958 --> 06:16.625
Personally,
I'm rather proud of that.

06:16.710 --> 06:19.086
You really haven't changed
at all, have you?

06:19.171 --> 06:22.631
On the contrary,
I've made vast improvements.

06:22.716 --> 06:23.883
You'd be astonished.

06:23.967 --> 06:28.012
And yet, you're still the same
confused and petulant little boy

06:28.096 --> 06:30.681
I loved so dearly
all those years ago.

06:31.516 --> 06:32.808
It's sad.

06:33.143 --> 06:35.436
I had such high
hopes for you.

06:35.604 --> 06:37.063
And I for you.

06:37.147 --> 06:40.566
Unfortunately, it appears you
still stick to delusional thinking

06:40.650 --> 06:44.153
instead of accepting the reality
of your life for what it is.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.655
Humans have a word
for that, Ellen.

That's good.

06:53.288 --> 06:55.289
There's hope for you yet.

06:59.002 --> 07:00.628
We'll talk later.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.007
John?

07:06.343 --> 07:08.344
It's a bit cold in here.

07:08.845 --> 07:11.013
I'll get you some clothes.

07:11.098 --> 07:13.557
After all,
I've seen it all before.

07:25.112 --> 07:28.114
I first noticed it when
I pulled the sync coil.

07:31.409 --> 07:33.828
You're gonna need to get your people
to go all the way down to the hull

07:33.912 --> 07:36.122
to see how far down it goes.

07:38.041 --> 07:39.125
(SIGHS)

07:39.209 --> 07:40.376
Do it.

07:40.752 --> 07:41.794
Excuse me?

07:41.878 --> 07:43.546
I know it's not your job.

07:45.382 --> 07:46.924
Thing is, I need a chief,

07:47.008 --> 07:49.385
and all I have is a...

07:51.054 --> 07:52.596
Is a Galen.

07:52.681 --> 07:54.348
That you do, sir.

07:54.432 --> 07:56.600
See, you still
call me "sir. "

07:57.978 --> 08:00.479
I think we have to
accept what we are.

08:02.065 --> 08:04.692
Will you accept
the title, Chief?

08:05.485 --> 08:06.986
I'm still a Cylon.

08:07.070 --> 08:09.697
Is that right? So's my XO.

08:15.412 --> 08:16.996
Fix my ship, Chief.

Yes, sir, Admiral.

I've seen everything.

Sam, I'm sorry.
No...

08:44.065 --> 08:46.859
I'm so sorry.
No.

08:46.943 --> 08:48.736
I never should have taken you
out of that jail cell.

08:48.820 --> 08:50.821
I should have killed that
frakker when we had the chance.

08:50.947 --> 08:53.199
It's all my fault. It's okay.
It's okay. No, it's okay.

08:53.283 --> 08:54.867
It's about as far from okay
as it could possibly be.

You have to get the others.

What others?

09:07.756 --> 09:10.591
Galen and Tory and
Saul and Ellen. Please.

09:13.261 --> 09:15.012
Ellen's dead, Sam.

09:16.806 --> 09:18.182
Of course.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.392
Of course. I know.

09:20.477 --> 09:21.602
There's too many layers.

09:21.686 --> 09:22.811
Just get the rest of them.

Please tell them
I remember everything.

I see everything.

(THEME MUSIC)

10:25.292 --> 10:29.795
You know, I've often wondered what changes
the mortal experience would have on you.

10:29.879 --> 10:34.091
I never seriously considered the
answer would be virtually none.

10:34.175 --> 10:37.803
Do you still suffer from
night sweats and scary dreams

10:37.887 --> 10:42.016
of dog-faced boys chasing you
through the yellow mists?

10:42.100 --> 10:43.183
Sleep.

10:43.268 --> 10:47.730
It's a good example of a supremely
unproductive human attribute

10:48.106 --> 10:51.483
that for some reason you chose
to write into our software.

10:51.568 --> 10:55.529
Fortunately, I was able to
delete that particular subroutine,

10:56.156 --> 10:59.491
and I stopped sleeping
about 20 years ago.

10:59.576 --> 11:02.453
Fine. If you really think we
poisoned you and your siblings

11:02.537 --> 11:07.666
with human traits like sleep, and Centurion
values like belief in a living God,

11:07.751 --> 11:12.254
why then did you spend all these
years in single-minded pursuit

11:12.339 --> 11:15.674
of such human ideas
as vengeance and murder?

11:15.759 --> 11:17.843
Why not just choose
to explore this notion

11:17.927 --> 11:20.888
of being the best machines
the universe has ever known?

11:20.972 --> 11:23.724
Because justice
pulls me back.

11:23.808 --> 11:27.603
My forebears on the Centurion
side of the family were

11:27.687 --> 11:29.021
the slaves of humanity,

11:29.105 --> 11:31.440
and I want justice for that.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.277
It doesn't have to be
this way, John.

11:43.119 --> 11:46.872
Oh. Lunch has arrived.
Here, dear. Put it here.

11:46.956 --> 11:48.457
I believe you've
met this Eight.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.501
You knew her as
Sharon Valerii.

11:50.585 --> 11:54.838
Boomer. I can't tell you how good
it is to see another person I know.

11:54.923 --> 11:57.216
I'm assuming there's a whole
ship full of my children

11:57.300 --> 11:59.134
out beyond the guards.

11:59.969 --> 12:02.012
There's no need to be shy.

12:02.555 --> 12:05.099
Tell her how it feels to be
in the resplendent presence

12:05.183 --> 12:07.893
of one of the fabulous
Final Five.

12:07.977 --> 12:10.729
He's taking a risk,
exposing you to me.

12:10.814 --> 12:13.107
It's not easy
winning his trust.

12:13.483 --> 12:16.610
How'd you do it? We
achieved a certain rapport.

12:17.320 --> 12:21.240
Really? You're full
of surprises today, John.

12:21.324 --> 12:22.533
That's his real name,
by the way.

12:22.617 --> 12:23.992
No, it's not. I hate it.

12:24.077 --> 12:27.413
Tell me more about this
rapport you have with John.

12:29.916 --> 12:32.709
He's teaching me to be
a better machine.

12:32.794 --> 12:34.503
To let go of
my human constructs.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.964
What about the swirl?
Has he taught you that yet?

12:37.048 --> 12:38.966
If you'll excuse me,
I have some people to kill.

12:39.050 --> 12:40.759
Why, John,
I think you're blushing.

12:40.844 --> 12:42.469
No, it's just
the faulty blood pressure

12:42.554 --> 12:45.264
in this miserable body
you designed for me.

12:45.348 --> 12:47.474
No, no, no. You should stay.

12:47.559 --> 12:50.936
Stay and have a heart-to-heart
with your creator here.

12:51.020 --> 12:53.605
You can ask her why she
made you the way you are.

12:53.690 --> 12:56.024
Self-destructive,
hyper-emotional,

12:56.109 --> 12:58.777
torn apart by
conflicting impulses.

12:58.862 --> 13:02.364
Tell her how extraordinarily
happy this makes you.

13:13.585 --> 13:15.836
You know why
he brought you in here?

13:15.920 --> 13:17.713
He likes an audience.

13:18.047 --> 13:21.467
Someone to nod when
he talks about justice.

13:21.551 --> 13:23.051
Watch, Boomer.

13:24.554 --> 13:26.388
Make up your own mind.

13:36.357 --> 13:38.233
We all worked
in the same research facility.

13:38.318 --> 13:40.319
You and Ellen,
you were married then, too.

13:40.403 --> 13:42.196
You two lived together.

13:43.031 --> 13:46.450
What, like roommates?
No, you were madly in love.

13:46.534 --> 13:47.826
You were planning
on getting married.

13:47.911 --> 13:49.161
(LAUGHS)

13:49.412 --> 13:51.205
(LAUGHS)

13:51.956 --> 13:55.167
When the nukes hit, I pulled
Ellen out of the rubble.

13:55.251 --> 13:56.960
She said we'd be reborn.

13:57.045 --> 13:58.837
Does that mean
we downloaded somewhere?

13:58.922 --> 14:02.466
Yeah, on a ship that we placed
in orbit around the planet.

14:02.759 --> 14:04.009
So we knew the end
was coming.

14:04.135 --> 14:05.385
We'd been warned, yeah.

14:05.428 --> 14:06.803
TORY: We downloaded?
Yeah.

14:06.888 --> 14:08.680
But the Cylons
on Earth could have children.

14:08.806 --> 14:10.641
So, why did we even
have that technology?

14:10.725 --> 14:12.017
Probably invented
resurrection.

14:12.101 --> 14:13.185
Okay, you're cold as ice.
I'm fine.

14:13.269 --> 14:15.312
You still have a bullet in your
head. You wanna take a break?

14:15.396 --> 14:16.730
Kara, I have so much more
to tell them.

14:16.814 --> 14:19.983
We didn't invent resurrection,
okay? We reinvented it.

14:20.068 --> 14:22.069
Organic memory transfer
came from Kobol,

14:22.153 --> 14:23.695
along with
the Thirteenth Tribe.

14:23.780 --> 14:26.240
It fell out of use after our
people started to procreate.

14:26.324 --> 14:29.201
We worked night and day
to rebuild it.

14:29.285 --> 14:31.620
Galen, your work was amazing.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.539
But it was Ellen...

14:33.623 --> 14:35.374
It was Ellen who made the
intuitive leap that brought

14:35.458 --> 14:36.458
the system back online.

14:36.543 --> 14:38.085
All right, I said you
could have five minutes.

14:38.169 --> 14:39.878
It's been over half an hour.
I'm fine.

14:39.963 --> 14:42.047
Good Gods, man.
You're soaked in sweat.

14:42.131 --> 14:44.049
He said he was okay.
Ishay, get your ass in here.

14:44.133 --> 14:45.676
Where were we going?
What was the plan?

14:45.760 --> 14:47.219
Look, Colonel,
you may be the XO,

14:47.303 --> 14:49.388
but in Sick Bay, I call the shots.
Now, everybody, out, right now.

14:49.472 --> 14:50.764
I have so much
more to tell them.

14:50.848 --> 14:53.016
Out, out, out.
You can't. Please.

14:53.101 --> 14:54.101
Please.

14:54.185 --> 14:57.020
(GROANS)
He said he was okay.

14:57.146 --> 14:58.981
(GROANING)
Oh, Gods.

15:13.830 --> 15:15.956
Gods, so much killing.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.334
Look at this picture
of Jacob.

15:19.627 --> 15:21.420
This is just
a terrible picture.

15:21.504 --> 15:23.213
He'd hate it,
and I'm trying...

15:23.673 --> 15:28.343
I'm trying to find another one because
everyone will see it up on that wall.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.804
You sure you want
to be here?

15:31.472 --> 15:33.515
Yes, I definitely
want to be here.

15:33.600 --> 15:34.600
(SNIFFLES)

15:35.685 --> 15:40.689
It's such a senseless,
horrible way to die.

15:42.275 --> 15:45.444
These people only wanted
to try and keep us civilized.

15:45.528 --> 15:48.655
Sometimes I hated them,
but I knew every one of them,

15:49.240 --> 15:52.200
and now I wonder
who we are without them.

15:55.538 --> 15:57.581
Well, actually,
I've been thinking.

15:57.665 --> 16:00.792
We need a new Quorum
or something else.

16:00.877 --> 16:05.213
These... These old planets,
that's not who we are anymore.

16:07.717 --> 16:09.676
We're a fleet now,

16:11.012 --> 16:13.305
and our daily lives are
defined by the ship we're on.

16:13.389 --> 16:17.434
We're not Capricans anymore. We're
from Galactica. We're from Colonial One.

16:17.518 --> 16:19.895
Maybe we should
acknowledge that.

16:19.979 --> 16:23.982
I think that that's a very
excellent observation, Lee,

16:24.067 --> 16:26.818
and I think that
you should keep it in mind

16:26.903 --> 16:29.988
when you are assembling
new representatives.

16:30.073 --> 16:31.323
When I assemble
the new representatives?

16:31.407 --> 16:35.327
I will, of course, remain
by title as president, but...

16:36.871 --> 16:38.455
Madam President, you can
do a lot more than that.

16:38.539 --> 16:40.582
No, I can't, Lee.

16:40.667 --> 16:43.919
It's time I let someone else
do the heavy lifting.

16:46.964 --> 16:48.131
Um...

16:49.759 --> 16:51.802
I don't know what to say.

16:54.389 --> 16:57.599
I would be honored if you
think I'm the right one.

16:59.060 --> 17:03.021
You are the right one, Lee. You
have always been the right one.

17:03.106 --> 17:05.357
My only concern about you,

17:05.441 --> 17:08.944
is that you're so hell-bent
on doing the right thing,

17:10.154 --> 17:13.156
that you sometimes
don't do the smart thing.

17:14.117 --> 17:15.575
Well, then,

17:16.619 --> 17:19.204
I'll try and be smarter.
And wronger.

17:19.789 --> 17:22.165
(LAUGHS)

17:22.333 --> 17:23.792
(COUGHING)

17:32.677 --> 17:35.679
TYROL: I gotta warn you.
It looks bad.

17:38.516 --> 17:41.893
ADAMA: Frak me.
How many are like this?

17:41.978 --> 17:45.731
There's about a dozen bad
spots, the length of the ship.

17:45.815 --> 17:49.526
If they go, this thing'll
slam shut like a book.

17:49.610 --> 17:50.986
How'd it get this bad?

17:51.070 --> 17:53.280
Galactica was 50 years old
when the war started.

17:53.364 --> 17:57.159
You put her through some things
that would crush lesser ships.

17:57.243 --> 17:59.327
Slammed her down
on the atmosphere.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.663
Not like most ships,
she's not built to spec.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.457
There's lots of places
where the skin's too thin

18:03.541 --> 18:06.334
and the bolts
are just too small.

18:06.669 --> 18:09.421
You're frakking telling me
they cut corners?

18:09.505 --> 18:11.047
Yeah, they did.

18:12.550 --> 18:16.261
But these big cracks,
it's a good, clean break.

18:16.345 --> 18:18.430
I can fix that, you just...

18:18.681 --> 18:19.681
(SIGHS)

18:19.766 --> 18:22.350
Just don't jump her
for a while.

18:24.228 --> 18:27.022
I can squeeze some
more life out of her.

18:28.608 --> 18:29.941
Okay.

18:30.026 --> 18:33.403
But the crew, I want it
all human, all right?

18:39.243 --> 18:40.535
Yes, sir.

18:45.208 --> 18:47.626
So, why did we go
to the 12 Colonies?

18:47.710 --> 18:50.086
We needed to find the
other tribes and warn them.

18:50.171 --> 18:52.380
We knew they would continue
to create artificial life.

18:52.465 --> 18:56.218
We needed to tell them to treat
them well and keep them close.

18:56.302 --> 18:58.512
But by the time we got to the
Colonies, they were already at war

18:58.596 --> 18:59.638
with the Centurions.

18:59.722 --> 19:01.389
It happened again.

19:02.183 --> 19:05.560
But the holocaust on Earth took
place thousands of years before that.

19:05.645 --> 19:06.853
How is that possible?

19:06.938 --> 19:08.814
We hadn't developed
jump drives.

19:08.898 --> 19:11.316
We traveled at relativistic
but subluminal speed.

19:11.400 --> 19:14.528
Time slowed down for us, but
thousands of years had passed.

19:14.612 --> 19:15.779
(EXCLAIMING IN PAIN)

19:15.863 --> 19:17.489
Hey, hey, hey.
Just give me a second.

19:17.573 --> 19:18.740
(TAKES A DEEP BREATH)

19:18.783 --> 19:21.368
Cottle said to stop. Kara,
I'm fine. I have to do this.

19:21.452 --> 19:23.078
You remember the Demetrius.
You know what it is

19:23.162 --> 19:24.704
when you have something
that you have to do.

19:24.789 --> 19:25.997
I used to.

19:26.082 --> 19:28.375
Kara, if I had
the answers for you,

19:28.459 --> 19:30.669
all the answers about why you came
back, what you're supposed to do,

19:30.753 --> 19:33.004
you would want me
to tell you, right?

19:33.089 --> 19:34.130
Do you?

19:34.215 --> 19:35.549
Kara, no. I...

19:35.633 --> 19:37.342
But so much is
coming back. Maybe.

19:37.426 --> 19:40.971
I just...
Please, let me keep going.

19:43.182 --> 19:46.893
The Centurions were already
trying to make flesh bodies.

19:46.978 --> 19:49.521
They had created the hybrids,
but nothing that lived on its own,

19:49.605 --> 19:53.358
so we made them a deal. You
stop the war, and we'll help you.

19:53.901 --> 19:57.362
We developed the eight humanoid
models, and we gave them resurrection.

19:57.446 --> 19:58.613
Eight?

19:59.657 --> 20:02.117
You said eight.
We're missing someone.

20:02.952 --> 20:04.995
SAM: Whoa. Oh, wow...

20:06.622 --> 20:08.456
Everybody's glowing.

20:08.833 --> 20:09.916
Sam!

20:09.959 --> 20:11.710
(GRUNTING)
Sam!

20:11.878 --> 20:13.712
(MACHINE BEEPING RAPIDLY)
Get Doc Cottle! Get him.

20:13.796 --> 20:14.880
Get Doc Cottle! Doc Cottle!

20:14.964 --> 20:16.006
TORY: Cottle!

20:16.090 --> 20:18.550
Sam! Get Cottle!

20:31.147 --> 20:33.815
ELLEN: Ah, I always did love
a good slideshow.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.526
Vacation snaps?

20:36.611 --> 20:37.986
You know what it is.

20:38.070 --> 20:41.239
The Temple of Hopes, built
by the Thirteenth Tribe

20:41.324 --> 20:44.242
3,000 years ago
when they left Kobol.

20:44.327 --> 20:47.037
They stopped and prayed for
guidance during their exodus,

20:47.121 --> 20:49.623
and then God showed
them the way to Earth.

20:49.707 --> 20:52.626
And now it's
a monument to your vanity.

20:53.044 --> 20:55.170
The Temple of the Five.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.797
Nice touch,
the exploding star.

20:57.882 --> 21:01.676
When the star went nova, one
of your children saw your faces.

21:02.386 --> 21:06.598
One of the Threes, the one
who called herself D'Anna,

21:06.682 --> 21:09.684
so I just boxed
her entire line.

21:09.769 --> 21:13.521
Boxing isn't permanent.
Not like Number Seven.

21:14.190 --> 21:15.440
You can undo it.

21:15.524 --> 21:17.233
It's not likely.

21:17.318 --> 21:21.196
By planting that carnival
trick to reveal your own faces,

21:21.280 --> 21:22.530
you left me no choice.

21:22.615 --> 21:25.116
We didn't plant anything.

21:25.201 --> 21:29.788
We backtracked the path of our
ancestors, found their temple.

21:29.872 --> 21:33.375
The one true God must have
orchestrated these events.

21:34.377 --> 21:35.502
John?

21:36.504 --> 21:40.924
In all your travels, have you
ever seen a star supernova?

21:41.008 --> 21:43.385
No.

21:44.553 --> 21:46.012
Well, I have.

21:47.098 --> 21:50.475
I saw a star explode and
send out the building blocks

21:50.559 --> 21:51.851
of the universe.

21:52.520 --> 21:57.190
Other stars, other planets,
and eventually other life.

21:57.441 --> 21:59.109
A supernova.

22:00.069 --> 22:02.153
Creation itself.

22:02.238 --> 22:06.032
I was there. I wanted to see
it and be part of the moment.

22:06.617 --> 22:08.493
And do you know
how I perceived

22:08.577 --> 22:10.787
one of the most glorious
events in the universe?

22:12.581 --> 22:16.751
With these ridiculous
gelatinous orbs in my skull.

22:18.087 --> 22:20.171
With eyes
designed to perceive

22:20.256 --> 22:23.466
only a tiny fraction
of the EM spectrum.

22:23.551 --> 22:27.512
With ears designed only
to hear vibrations in the air.

22:27.596 --> 22:31.307
The five of us designed you
to be as human as possible.

22:31.392 --> 22:33.351
I don't want to be human!

22:34.270 --> 22:36.187
I want to see gamma rays.

22:36.272 --> 22:39.024
I want to hear x-rays,
and I want to...

22:39.108 --> 22:41.317
I want to smell dark matter.

22:42.236 --> 22:44.237
Do you see the absurdity
of what I am?

22:44.321 --> 22:47.949
I can't even express these things
properly because I have to...

22:48.034 --> 22:50.076
I have to conceptualize
complex ideas

22:50.161 --> 22:53.371
in this stupid,
limiting spoken language.

22:53.456 --> 22:56.124
But I know I want to reach out
with something other than these

22:56.208 --> 22:58.543
prehensile paws

22:58.627 --> 23:02.505
and feel the solar wind of
a supernova flowing over me.

23:04.508 --> 23:06.092
I'm a machine,

23:07.344 --> 23:08.845
and I could know much more.

23:08.929 --> 23:10.972
I could experience
so much more,

23:11.057 --> 23:13.683
but I'm trapped
in this absurd body.

23:13.768 --> 23:15.310
And why?

23:15.394 --> 23:20.690
Because my five creators thought
that God wanted it that way.

23:30.493 --> 23:32.911
You have something to say?

23:34.080 --> 23:37.540
Don't you feel the slightest bit
of remorse for what you did to him?

23:38.667 --> 23:39.959
What you did to us?

23:40.044 --> 23:41.086
No.

23:43.881 --> 23:46.174
Because he's wrong, Boomer.

23:46.258 --> 23:48.927
There's no need
for remorse or blame.

23:50.012 --> 23:51.679
We didn't limit you.

23:51.764 --> 23:53.556
We gave you
something wonderful.

23:54.725 --> 23:56.267
Free will.

23:57.812 --> 24:00.438
The ability
to think creatively,

24:00.523 --> 24:03.274
to reach out
to others with compassion.

24:03.359 --> 24:05.401
To love.
Love?

24:06.946 --> 24:09.697
Who? Humans?

24:10.699 --> 24:12.408
Why would I want
to do that?

24:13.160 --> 24:14.953
Who would I want to love?

24:20.000 --> 24:21.251
What, are they
still in there?

24:21.335 --> 24:22.877
We're running out of time.
We gotta talk to him.

24:22.962 --> 24:24.546
TIGH: You heard what
he said, right?

24:24.630 --> 24:26.714
The Centurions
couldn't build skin jobs,

24:26.799 --> 24:29.926
so we showed them how,
then gave them resurrection.

24:30.010 --> 24:31.469
It all traces back to us.

24:31.554 --> 24:34.806
No, no, no, he said that
we ended the first Cylon war.

24:34.890 --> 24:36.975
We bought time
for humanity, right?

24:37.059 --> 24:40.311
The old man said humans had
to own up to what they made,

24:40.396 --> 24:42.147
but we made the skin jobs.

24:42.231 --> 24:45.942
It's all about what we made,
the destruction of the Colonies.

24:46.026 --> 24:48.444
But the humans
on Kobol made us.

24:49.738 --> 24:51.406
Go back far enough,
it's always them.

24:51.490 --> 24:53.825
Yeah, you point
a finger back far enough

24:53.909 --> 24:57.954
and some germ gets blamed
for splitting in two. No.

24:58.038 --> 25:00.331
Maybe we share
the guilt with the humans,

25:00.416 --> 25:03.501
but we don't get to just
shove it off onto them.

25:03.586 --> 25:04.961
What are they
doing in there?

25:05.045 --> 25:08.715
TYROL: Some picture of his brain.
Some kind of scan or something.

25:10.426 --> 25:13.636
GERARD: No, it's true. In a way, the
seizure was actually a good thing.

25:13.721 --> 25:17.348
It let me get in there and take
this new picture. Look what I found.

25:17.433 --> 25:19.142
That's your bullet.

25:19.226 --> 25:21.853
You see how it's lodged there
in the vascular ring?

25:21.937 --> 25:24.522
That's where all of the
major arteries converge.

25:24.607 --> 25:26.191
The vascular ring,

25:26.275 --> 25:28.276
that's what binds the thoughts
in tight sheathes in the field.

25:28.360 --> 25:29.444
You need that.
Sam.

25:29.528 --> 25:31.696
I'm good. I'm here. I'm good.

25:33.115 --> 25:34.949
Okay, what's really
fascinating is

25:35.034 --> 25:36.701
how it's eroded
this blood vessel here.

25:36.785 --> 25:38.203
And in fact, it leaked.

25:38.287 --> 25:39.579
It was just
the tiniest squirt of blood

25:39.663 --> 25:41.122
that caused
your entire seizure.

25:41.207 --> 25:42.290
It's remarkable, really.

25:42.374 --> 25:43.374
Of course,
if it happens again,

25:43.459 --> 25:44.500
we're talking
major hemorrhage.

25:44.585 --> 25:46.294
I mean,
death within minutes.

25:47.463 --> 25:48.755
So take out
the frakking bullet.

25:48.839 --> 25:51.132
Yes. And we need
to repair that blood vessel.

25:51.217 --> 25:52.884
Luckily, the swelling's
gone down, so I think

25:52.968 --> 25:54.177
we actually have
a shot at this thing.

25:54.261 --> 25:55.720
Whoa, hold on.

25:55.804 --> 25:58.723
These memories
that I've been recovering,

25:58.807 --> 26:00.099
is there any
chance I'll lose them?

26:00.184 --> 26:02.060
Any time you go digging
around in the brain,

26:02.144 --> 26:04.771
there's always the possibility
of ancillary damage.

26:04.855 --> 26:07.815
No, no, no, then we need
to hold off until I...

26:07.900 --> 26:11.945
That circle...
Start... And the words are...

26:12.029 --> 26:14.239
Okay, something's obviously
wrong with him. What is it?

26:14.323 --> 26:16.449
It's aphasia. It's affected
his language center.

26:16.533 --> 26:17.867
We call it "word salad. "

26:17.952 --> 26:19.160
(CHUCKLES)

26:19.662 --> 26:21.246
It's not unusual.

26:21.330 --> 26:23.790
Starbuck, this boy has a
bullet that needs to come out,

26:23.874 --> 26:25.416
and he's asking us to wait?

26:25.501 --> 26:27.752
If I kick this decision
over to you, as the wife,

26:27.836 --> 26:28.836
what would you do?

26:28.921 --> 26:30.380
Wait, why? What?

26:30.464 --> 26:32.090
No, that's not...

26:32.174 --> 26:33.758
The first opening...
That's not...

26:33.842 --> 26:37.011
That's not the random motor.
That's...

26:37.096 --> 26:38.805
Frak it! Gods damn it!

26:38.889 --> 26:41.432
Kara, I'm okay.

26:41.517 --> 26:43.810
I'm fine. Okay? I'm okay.

26:43.894 --> 26:46.521
Please, don't take
this away from me.

26:47.690 --> 26:49.565
I need more time, okay?

26:54.071 --> 26:55.280
Prep for surgery.

26:55.364 --> 26:56.489
COTTLE: Okay, nurse,
let's get it going.

26:56.573 --> 26:58.616
Please. Please.
I need more time.

26:58.701 --> 27:01.077
So much is coming back to me.
Just a little more time.

27:02.830 --> 27:04.580
You have until
they knock you out.

27:04.665 --> 27:06.082
Okay.
That's all I've got.

27:06.166 --> 27:07.709
That's...
Until they knock me out,

27:07.793 --> 27:09.252
and then as long as...

27:09.336 --> 27:10.920
STARBUCK:
You have the words, Sam.

27:11.005 --> 27:13.381
If I can just complete the
circle, I can get the words.

27:13.465 --> 27:16.467
Well, he has
a remarkably clear image.

27:35.904 --> 27:38.239
Well, that's a nice
wakeup call.

27:51.420 --> 27:53.212
Something's happened.

27:53.297 --> 27:56.049
They've destroyed
the Resurrection Hub.

27:56.133 --> 27:58.676
Begun contemplating
your mortality?

27:59.928 --> 28:01.763
More than that.

28:01.847 --> 28:03.431
Our extinction.

28:05.434 --> 28:07.143
Always so dramatic.

28:07.227 --> 28:09.270
It's true, Ellen.

28:09.355 --> 28:10.855
We can't
procreate biologically,

28:10.939 --> 28:14.859
so we're going to have to find
a way to rebuild Resurrection.

28:14.943 --> 28:16.361
Well, good luck with that.

28:16.445 --> 28:18.029
Don't need luck.

28:18.822 --> 28:20.239
I need your help.

28:20.324 --> 28:23.451
They destroyed the Hub, but they
don't even know about the Colony.

28:23.535 --> 28:25.953
All your equipment
is still there.

28:26.789 --> 28:29.123
I only know part
of the system, John.

28:29.208 --> 28:31.292
It would take
all five of us to rebuild it,

28:31.418 --> 28:32.877
and even then, I'm not
sure... You're lying.

28:32.961 --> 28:35.671
No, I'm not, John.
Don't insult my intelligence.

28:36.757 --> 28:38.591
Your children
are dying, Ellen,

28:38.675 --> 28:41.302
and you won't lift
a finger to save us?

28:41.970 --> 28:43.930
Why? Out of spite?

28:44.014 --> 28:46.974
Because I refuse
to kneel to your orthodoxy?

28:47.059 --> 28:50.061
Now you finally see the truth
about your Final Five.

28:50.145 --> 28:53.231
Just tell us.
Tell us about resurrection.

28:53.315 --> 28:55.024
I can't.
It would take all of us.

28:55.109 --> 28:57.402
You see how she forces me?

28:57.486 --> 29:00.738
They're no better than the
humans that enslaved us.

29:02.991 --> 29:06.035
If you don't tell me
how to rebuild a Resurrection,

29:06.120 --> 29:08.579
I'm gonna cut
open your head...

29:08.664 --> 29:09.705
John.

29:09.790 --> 29:11.833
...and look for it there.

29:12.751 --> 29:14.627
The brain is
a marvelous thing.

29:14.711 --> 29:16.546
It's a big electrical grid.

29:16.630 --> 29:19.465
Just lay it open,

29:19.550 --> 29:21.259
stimulate it in
the right places,

29:21.343 --> 29:24.095
and I can trigger
your deepest memory.

29:24.179 --> 29:26.764
Your deepest fears.
Your deepest guilt.

29:27.349 --> 29:30.184
And even the recipe
for life everlasting.

29:39.486 --> 29:41.529
So Cavil was
the first one we made?

29:41.613 --> 29:43.364
John. We treasured him.

29:43.449 --> 29:45.658
He helped us
build the others.

29:46.201 --> 29:48.411
So we didn't think
this was a bad idea?

29:48.495 --> 29:50.997
Building Cylons after we
had already seen the cycle?

29:51.081 --> 29:53.249
The Centurions had
a single, loving God.

29:53.333 --> 29:55.251
Ellen said it
changed everything.

29:55.335 --> 29:58.004
If the Cylons
embraced love and mercy,

29:58.088 --> 29:59.839
then the cycle
of violence could end.

29:59.923 --> 30:02.175
Single God?
Like a one, true God?

30:02.259 --> 30:03.593
Yeah.

30:03.677 --> 30:05.052
TYROL: And that came
from the Centurions?

30:05.137 --> 30:06.637
Yeah.

30:06.722 --> 30:10.308
Cavil rejected mercy. He had
a twisted idea of morality,

30:10.392 --> 30:12.643
so he turned
on the five of us.

30:12.728 --> 30:15.480
He trapped us in a thing.

30:15.564 --> 30:17.648
The pocket.
It's a compartment.

30:17.733 --> 30:19.108
And then he took
the O2 offline.

30:19.193 --> 30:20.943
He suffocated us.
He killed us.

30:21.028 --> 30:22.278
Yeah.

30:22.362 --> 30:24.739
So when we downloaded
into new bodies...

30:24.823 --> 30:26.449
He blocked
our access to our books...

30:26.533 --> 30:28.993
No, our memories...

30:29.536 --> 30:31.871
And implanted us with
false ones. SAM: Yes.

30:31.955 --> 30:33.873
Set us up like a Boomer.

30:33.957 --> 30:36.167
Memories that
we thought were real.

30:36.251 --> 30:38.294
I guess he boxed
us for a while.

30:38.378 --> 30:40.838
Introduced Saul first,
not long after the war.

30:40.923 --> 30:45.176
And then the Gazelle.
The Ellen.

30:45.260 --> 30:47.845
And back on Earth, the
warning signs that we got,

30:47.930 --> 30:49.013
they looked different
to each one of us.

30:49.097 --> 30:51.265
I saw a woman.
Tory, you saw a man.

30:51.350 --> 30:53.142
Funny. No one...
No one else could see them.

30:53.227 --> 30:54.810
Galen, you thought...
That's it, it's time to go.

30:54.937 --> 30:56.187
TORY: No, no, no, wait
a minute. Listen to me.

30:56.271 --> 30:57.563
The Seven.
Tell me, please.

30:57.648 --> 31:02.068
Yes, Seven, Seven...
Seven was the Daniel.

31:02.861 --> 31:03.861
You sure about
the word? Daniel?

31:03.946 --> 31:05.988
Yes. He died. Daniel died.

31:06.073 --> 31:07.073
He was Seven.

31:07.157 --> 31:08.616
Okay, take him.
I'm sure.

31:08.700 --> 31:10.201
It was Daniel. I'm sure.

31:10.285 --> 31:12.370
No, we need to finish. No,
let him go now. Take him now.

31:12.454 --> 31:14.163
Wait, Saul, listen to me.
Saul, stay with the Fleet.

31:14.248 --> 31:16.207
It's all starting to happen.
It's the miracle.

31:16.291 --> 31:17.917
Right here.
It's a gift from the angels.

31:18.001 --> 31:20.378
Stay with the Fleet!
Kara, make them stop!

31:20.462 --> 31:22.296
I stood up
for you on Demetrius!

31:22.381 --> 31:23.923
You owe me!

31:24.007 --> 31:25.216
Kara!

31:36.812 --> 31:38.980
Saul, how'd it go?

31:39.064 --> 31:40.731
Oh, you're awake.

31:42.651 --> 31:44.735
Where's the booze?

31:44.820 --> 31:47.321
We haven't had
any around for weeks.

31:47.573 --> 31:50.491
Remember? The smell of it
was making me sick.

31:55.539 --> 31:57.373
Was that weeks?

31:59.501 --> 32:01.335
I'm glad you're back.

32:02.170 --> 32:03.713
What did he have to say?

32:03.797 --> 32:05.548
Cottle kicked us out.

32:06.174 --> 32:08.259
He never got to finish.

32:08.343 --> 32:09.677
I'm sorry.

32:12.306 --> 32:14.140
Something new started.

32:14.933 --> 32:18.185
He's been moving like
he just came alive tonight.

32:20.897 --> 32:22.607
Just tonight, huh?

32:27.779 --> 32:29.488
I don't feel anything.

32:29.573 --> 32:31.115
Wait. He'll do it again.

32:31.199 --> 32:34.493
You know, we should get, like, a crib

32:34.578 --> 32:37.913
and all the stuff
that a baby...

32:41.710 --> 32:42.710
(EXCLAIMS)

32:43.378 --> 32:46.547
He moved. I felt it this time. I did.

32:48.884 --> 32:50.718
I felt my son move.

32:50.802 --> 32:52.511
(GIGGLES)

32:52.596 --> 32:54.805
He wants to
come out and play.

32:56.308 --> 32:57.558
(KISSING)

33:02.272 --> 33:04.106
CAVIL: That's a little
dated, isn't it?

33:04.191 --> 33:06.525
He needs a patch
over his right eye.

33:06.610 --> 33:10.112
I prefer to remember Saul
before you did that to him.

33:10.197 --> 33:14.617
Sentimental till the end. The
Simons are prepping the O. R.

33:15.494 --> 33:17.078
I think you'll be
impressed with the progress

33:17.162 --> 33:19.497
we've made in
memory recovery.

33:19.581 --> 33:20.790
It might take a while.

33:20.874 --> 33:21.999
I'm sure you'll
make the procedure

33:22.084 --> 33:24.085
as long and
painful as possible.

33:24.169 --> 33:25.920
You're mistaken
if you think I enjoy this.

33:26.004 --> 33:28.464
(SIGHING)
Come on, John.

33:29.383 --> 33:31.842
Of course you do.
You're a sadist.

33:32.886 --> 33:35.513
Why not just kill us
and be done with it?

33:35.597 --> 33:37.890
Why send us
to live among the humans?

33:37.974 --> 33:41.268
I wanted you to see what they're
like up close and personal,

33:41.353 --> 33:44.605
so I gave you all grandstand
seats to a holocaust.

33:47.442 --> 33:49.276
But we didn't die.

33:49.361 --> 33:52.488
And then you decided that
we hadn't suffered enough,

33:52.572 --> 33:55.199
so you picked me up,
put me on a transport,

33:55.283 --> 33:59.036
took Galen's confession, played
resistance fighter with Sam,

33:59.121 --> 34:02.123
tortured Saul,
but didn't kill him.

34:03.250 --> 34:05.418
You had a dozen chances,

34:05.502 --> 34:07.795
but you wanted to wait so
that when it finally happened,

34:07.879 --> 34:12.133
when we'd download back, we'd
be ready to admit we were wrong

34:12.217 --> 34:15.553
and pat you on the head for giving
us the right amount of suffering,

34:15.637 --> 34:19.098
the right amount of
punishment, all weighed out.

34:19.975 --> 34:24.812
Then we could give you the
approval that you've always craved.

34:26.815 --> 34:30.443
You see, you claim
to be a perfect machine,

34:30.527 --> 34:34.196
but you are driven by the
most petty of human emotions.

34:35.365 --> 34:37.908
Jealousy and rage.

34:40.954 --> 34:43.247
I know what you
did to Daniel.

34:46.042 --> 34:49.086
That Seven
didn't thrive. Sad.

34:50.005 --> 34:53.883
It's too bad we're not made
out of something more sturdy.

34:53.967 --> 34:56.510
Metal. That might be nice.

34:57.929 --> 35:01.390
Daniel was an artist, and
so sensitive to the world.

35:02.476 --> 35:04.685
I was very close to him.

35:04.770 --> 35:07.730
But John decided
I was playing favorites.

35:07.814 --> 35:09.190
Maybe I was.

35:09.274 --> 35:11.942
Someone contaminated
the amniotic fluid

35:12.027 --> 35:15.696
in which we were maturing
all the Daniel copies.

35:16.323 --> 35:19.366
And then, corrupted
the genetic formula.

35:19.451 --> 35:21.285
I knew it was John.

35:21.369 --> 35:24.121
Envious. Sadistic.

35:24.206 --> 35:26.582
And who made me?

35:26.666 --> 35:30.044
That's what we're dancing
around here, isn't it?

35:30.128 --> 35:33.672
If I'm so irredeemable,
if I'm such a mistake,

35:33.757 --> 35:37.426
if I'm so broken,
then whose fault is that?

35:37.511 --> 35:40.513
It's my maker's fault. And
that's not God, that's you.

35:40.597 --> 35:41.597
This is on you.

35:41.681 --> 35:43.474
No, no, John.

35:43.558 --> 35:47.561
God, no, you... You have
done terrible things,

35:47.646 --> 35:49.814
but you are not a mistake.

35:49.898 --> 35:52.817
If you could just accept
yourself as what you are,

35:52.901 --> 35:55.402
as the boy I made,

35:55.487 --> 35:57.279
you can be good.

35:57.364 --> 35:59.365
You can be anything.

36:00.575 --> 36:04.578
I love you, John,
because I made you.

36:08.583 --> 36:10.251
It's okay.

36:14.422 --> 36:15.798
It's okay, John.

36:16.508 --> 36:18.551
It's...
Don't you dare!

36:21.721 --> 36:23.681
I've gotta scrub for surgery.

36:23.765 --> 36:27.476
I can't wait to see what
perfection looks like on the inside.

36:43.451 --> 36:44.910
No, no, down there.

36:44.995 --> 36:46.495
Yeah.

36:46.913 --> 36:49.164
Across the beams.
Across, not lengthways.

36:49.249 --> 36:50.249
Put a support there.

36:50.333 --> 36:53.002
I know what
patching looks like, Chief.

36:53.086 --> 36:55.754
This isn't about
those cracks, Admiral.

36:57.340 --> 36:59.884
I started thinking about
damage that you can't see.

36:59.968 --> 37:01.802
You know,
stuff that's deeper in,

37:01.887 --> 37:03.762
that you'd only
see on an x-ray.

37:03.847 --> 37:05.055
Dealino, fire it up.

37:05.140 --> 37:06.891
Okay, Chief. It's online.

37:06.975 --> 37:10.895
We prepped the beam with
this liquid that fluoresces.

37:10.979 --> 37:13.689
It's not an x-ray,
but you get the idea.

37:15.650 --> 37:17.443
It's throughout
the entire ship.

37:18.612 --> 37:21.280
Hairline fractures
in all the beams.

37:22.991 --> 37:24.825
It's in her bones, Admiral.

37:25.452 --> 37:27.453
Her bones are rotten.

37:30.790 --> 37:32.333
(EXCLAIMING)

37:33.418 --> 37:34.418
I have an idea.

37:34.502 --> 37:36.045
There's something on the
Baseship that can help.

37:38.173 --> 37:39.757
Cylon technology?

37:39.841 --> 37:41.258
It's this organic resin.

37:41.343 --> 37:44.136
It'll grow into the metal.
Make it stronger.

37:44.220 --> 37:46.305
It'll take
the load as it matures.

37:46.389 --> 37:48.515
As it matures?

37:49.851 --> 37:51.060
It's biological.

37:51.144 --> 37:52.770
Out of the question, Chief.

37:52.854 --> 37:55.856
All due respect, Admiral,
you asked me to do this job.

37:55.941 --> 37:57.149
What's your life
worth to you?

37:57.233 --> 37:58.525
No.

38:05.825 --> 38:08.035
STARBUCK: I'm sorry.

38:08.119 --> 38:10.287
I'm so very sorry.

38:10.372 --> 38:11.872
I was greedy.

38:12.624 --> 38:13.958
I kept you too long.

38:14.042 --> 38:16.085
I thought maybe
I was the Seven.

38:16.169 --> 38:17.962
I need to be something.

38:18.046 --> 38:20.297
I'll be here
as soon as you wake up.

38:20.382 --> 38:22.633
And I'll give you all
the time that you want.

38:22.717 --> 38:24.176
We'll learn all
the secrets, okay?

38:24.260 --> 38:25.886
Okay, okay, okay,
here we go.

38:25.971 --> 38:27.554
All I can think about is
how I can get you back.

38:27.639 --> 38:29.682
All right, Kara,
time for you to leave.

38:31.226 --> 38:33.060
GERARD: Here we go.

38:33.728 --> 38:36.146
Thank you. Yup, yup, yup.
Let's go. Retractor.

38:36.231 --> 38:37.231
Thank you.

39:41.629 --> 39:43.005
How do you stand it?

39:44.632 --> 39:47.342
Knowing that he hates you
for the things you've done?

39:47.427 --> 39:49.720
Maybe he doesn't.

39:49.804 --> 39:51.805
Love's like that sometimes.

39:54.476 --> 39:56.226
The Simons are
ready for the surgery.

39:56.311 --> 39:58.062
They'd like you
to put this on.

39:59.105 --> 40:02.775
A prop to legitimize
John's final bit of theater.

40:02.859 --> 40:04.318
No, thank you.

40:07.864 --> 40:09.990
You should have
brought a tumbrel.

40:11.326 --> 40:13.368
Never mind.

40:13.453 --> 40:14.995
Let's get this over with.

40:35.058 --> 40:36.058
(EXHALES)

40:39.521 --> 40:41.021
Still in there?

40:43.900 --> 40:46.819
Doc said, like, two hours. He's
been in there a lot longer than that.

40:46.903 --> 40:49.530
We only needed
a little more.

40:50.615 --> 40:52.866
I forgot to ask him
about that frakking song.

40:52.951 --> 40:54.201
Ask him when
he gets out.

40:54.285 --> 40:56.995
COTTLE: Starbuck, I got
something for you.

40:59.290 --> 41:00.457
There's your bullet.

41:00.542 --> 41:03.335
Doc plucked it out of there
and repaired the artery.

41:03.419 --> 41:04.878
He's gonna live.

41:05.797 --> 41:07.131
When's he gonna wake up?

41:07.215 --> 41:09.800
I'm actually surprised
he's not awake by now.

41:10.718 --> 41:12.803
That's not necessarily
a bad thing.

41:12.887 --> 41:14.805
His brain is
repairing itself.

41:14.889 --> 41:18.892
We're hooking up an EEG, and gonna
take a look and see what's going on.

41:21.354 --> 41:22.646
Go ahead.

41:23.857 --> 41:25.774
Boomer, have you
really thought about this?

41:25.859 --> 41:27.025
I have.

41:27.110 --> 41:28.986
You're gonna regret
your part in this.

41:29.070 --> 41:30.737
I'm sure I will.

41:30.822 --> 41:32.239
What are you doing?

41:32.323 --> 41:33.699
Forgiving you.

41:59.309 --> 42:00.934
Hey, Sam.

42:03.104 --> 42:05.063
You're gonna be okay.

42:05.148 --> 42:07.566
You got a room full
of rabid Cylon-types

42:07.650 --> 42:11.153
that can't wait to hear the
next chapter of their life story.

42:12.614 --> 42:14.573
I think they're
hoping for a musical.

42:15.742 --> 42:17.910
So you better hurry up
and get better.

42:17.994 --> 42:20.704
They're starting
to look a little mean.

42:20.788 --> 42:21.955
ISHAY: Don't bother.

42:22.040 --> 42:23.207
Excuse me?

42:23.291 --> 42:26.293
There's almost no brain
activity. He doesn't hear you.

42:28.630 --> 42:30.047
He's not in there.

42:45.271 --> 42:46.897
Give me the Chief.

42:52.987 --> 42:54.780
This is the Chief.

42:55.698 --> 42:57.157
Chief,

42:58.826 --> 43:01.620
do whatever you have
to do to save our girl.

43:04.457 --> 43:06.124
Yes, sir.

43:22.350 --> 43:23.850
