00:13.173 --> 00:15.790
<i>time stopped.</i>

00:15.792 --> 00:17.992
This might be the worst
thing I've ever done.

00:17.994 --> 00:19.610
Hey, now,

00:19.612 --> 00:22.346
you weren't at the top of your
game, but it was still pretty...

00:22.348 --> 00:23.681
Oh, my God!

00:23.683 --> 00:25.066
I just cheated
on Kevin.

00:25.068 --> 00:26.985
He is the nicest guy ever.

00:26.987 --> 00:28.987
I'm a terrible person.

00:28.989 --> 00:30.154
It's okay.

00:30.156 --> 00:31.456
We both cheated.

00:31.458 --> 00:34.459
What's that saying about
two wrongs making a right?

00:34.461 --> 00:36.127
"Two wrongs don't make a right"?

00:36.129 --> 00:38.830
No, that's not it.

00:38.832 --> 00:40.465
Oh, my God.

00:40.467 --> 00:41.916
I just cheated on Nora.

00:41.918 --> 00:43.701
How could I do this to her?
What are we gonna do?

00:43.703 --> 00:44.585
I don't know.

00:44.587 --> 00:46.087
Well...

00:46.089 --> 00:49.090
Can I ask you, did
this mean anything?

00:49.092 --> 00:50.558
Of course it did.

00:51.310 --> 00:52.760
Of course it didn't.

00:52.762 --> 00:55.379
Which one are you looking for?
I could see it going either way.

00:55.381 --> 00:57.398
It meant nothing.
It meant nothing!

00:57.400 --> 00:58.766
How could you say
it meant nothing?!

00:58.768 --> 01:00.101
Of course it meant something!

01:00.103 --> 01:02.020
- No, it didn't! It can't.
- (groans)

01:02.022 --> 01:06.824
Okay? You're with Nora,
and I'm with Kevin and...

01:06.826 --> 01:08.109
I have to go.

01:08.111 --> 01:09.410
Wait, what are
we gonna tell them?

01:09.412 --> 01:10.411
Nothing.

01:10.413 --> 01:12.613
God! We made a
horrible mistake.

01:12.615 --> 01:14.065
But it-it is over now.

01:14.067 --> 01:16.701
There's no reason to hurt more
people by talking about it.

01:16.703 --> 01:20.038
You're asking me to lie?

01:20.040 --> 01:22.373
That's... fine.

01:22.375 --> 01:23.458
Damn it.

01:23.460 --> 01:25.209
Nora and I have that work cruise
tomorrow night.

01:25.211 --> 01:26.511
We're all supposed
to go together.

01:26.513 --> 01:30.381
Okay, I know this is thinking
way, way out of the box,

01:30.383 --> 01:33.134
but what if-- and hear me out--

01:33.136 --> 01:34.635
we don't go?

01:34.637 --> 01:36.220
No.

01:36.222 --> 01:39.090
I just want this whole night
to fade into history,

01:39.092 --> 01:41.559
so we have to act like
it never happened.

01:41.561 --> 01:42.760
We should go.

01:42.762 --> 01:44.762
I mean, it's a three-hour
boat ride--

01:44.764 --> 01:45.863
what could happen?

01:45.865 --> 01:49.404
I'm sure that's what Gilligan.

02:14.737 --> 02:16.553
Ah, to really
take us back,

02:16.555 --> 02:20.357

02:26.699 --> 02:28.382
...nated steak subs.

02:28.384 --> 02:29.800
Oh, yeah!

02:29.802 --> 02:34.138
Well, as future parents,
we'll pass on the sandwiches.

02:34.140 --> 02:36.223
How could you even suggest
such a thing, Ted?!

02:36.225 --> 02:38.308
(whispers): I better
get my 60 bucks back.

02:38.310 --> 02:39.727
No sandwich?

02:39.729 --> 02:41.762
Marshall, it's a palooza.

02:41.764 --> 02:43.814
We've eaten sandwiches
at every palooza.

02:53.075 --> 02:55.492
before Lily gets here,
let's fire this up.

02:55.494 --> 02:58.228
No way. I promised Lily
that I would be responsible.

02:58.230 --> 02:59.663
You're not getting
your 60 bucks back.

02:59.665 --> 03:01.448

holding up?

03:11.427 --> 03:14.044
Well, I'm about to be
trapped on boat all night

03:14.046 --> 03:16.630
with the guy I cheated on,
the guy I cheated with

03:16.632 --> 03:19.082
and the girl that the guy
I cheated with cheated on.

03:19.084 --> 03:20.384
So, not super.

03:20.386 --> 03:21.585
Hi, Sandy.

03:21.587 --> 03:22.803
You're welcome.

03:22.805 --> 03:24.855
I did not say "Thank you."

03:24.857 --> 03:26.756
Oh, you're too kind.

03:26.758 --> 03:28.525
Too kind.

03:28.527 --> 03:30.310
Excuse me, I
should really try

03:30.312 --> 03:32.062

03:37.570 --> 03:40.988
<i>And he'd found a clever way</i>
<i>to never spend a cent.</i>

03:40.990 --> 03:42.439
Up next, another four deaths

03:42.441 --> 03:45.442
in Arizona's record-breaking
heat wave.

03:45.444 --> 03:47.878
You want real

03:47.880 --> 03:52.716
Try Kristoff's Jalapeño

03:56.422 --> 03:57.754

03:57.756 --> 03:59.506
are gonna be here any minute.

03:59.508 --> 04:01.592
I thought I could handle this,
but I can't.

04:01.594 --> 04:03.010
Okay, um, here's the plan.

04:03.012 --> 04:05.312
We'll grab one of the
lifeboats, get back to shore,

04:05.314 --> 04:06.897
destroy the tape
of us doing it...

04:06.899 --> 04:08.065
There's a tape of us doing it?

04:08.067 --> 04:09.600
...and we'll start
a new life together.

04:09.602 --> 04:12.903
Somewhere simple and homey,
like Vermont or Dubai.

04:12.905 --> 04:14.938

04:14.940 --> 04:17.074

KEVIN:
Hey, Robin.

04:18.142 --> 04:20.194
Oh, God, I really
can't do this.

04:20.196 --> 04:22.529
Don't worry. Just follow my lead
and keep cool.

04:22.531 --> 04:23.780
Hey, guys!

04:23.782 --> 04:25.699
(whispers):
They know!

04:25.701 --> 04:28.985
Oh, no.

04:28.987 --> 04:33.590
I think that sandwich was
laced with other stuff.

04:33.592 --> 04:35.092
Like, hard meats.

04:35.094 --> 04:36.052
What do you mean?

04:36.394 --> 04:40.114
Well, usually after a sandwich,
I feel paranoid. But I'm not.

04:41.433 --> 04:42.933
Why am I not
feeling paranoid?!

04:42.935 --> 04:44.935
What do you mean?
Calm down, dude!

04:44.937 --> 04:46.770
We'll be fine.

04:46.772 --> 04:48.972
Lily's gonna know.

04:48.974 --> 04:51.341
Listen to me.

04:51.343 --> 04:55.028
Whatever we were just
talking about...

04:55.030 --> 04:56.980
we'll be fine.

04:56.982 --> 04:58.982
You're right, she
won't find out.

04:58.984 --> 04:59.950
Hey, guy

04:59.952 --> 05:02.286
(whispers):
She knows!

05:02.288 --> 05:03.453
Good evening.

05:03.455 --> 05:06.290
A special welcome
our four new interns:

05:06.292 --> 05:08.709
Erika... and so on.

05:08.711 --> 05:10.911
One safety matter:
life preservers are

05:10.913 --> 05:13.163
on the side rails,
in case anyone falls overboard.

05:13.165 --> 05:16.199
That's it.
Have a good night.

05:16.201 --> 05:17.584
Don't drink too much.

05:17.586 --> 05:18.886
Or do.

05:21.139 --> 05:23.206
Beautiful night,
huh, gang?

05:23.208 --> 05:25.559
Yeah, Robin and I
were just cheating--

05:25.561 --> 05:27.978
chatting about
how warm it is.

05:27.980 --> 05:30.547
I'm breaking a
trust-- sweat

05:30.549 --> 05:31.565
in here.

05:31.567 --> 05:33.183
(chucks)

05:33.185 --> 05:35.986
And I thought
we'd be cuckold.

05:35.988 --> 05:38.071
I know why you're
so nervous, Barney.

05:38.073 --> 05:39.556
You do?

05:39.558 --> 05:41.942
You're meeting Nora's parents
tomorrow night, right?

05:41.944 --> 05:42.993
(laughs)

05:42.995 --> 05:44.828
That's it!
That's it!

05:44.830 --> 05:45.662
Let's dance!

05:45.664 --> 05:47.414
Bah!
Whoo!

05:50.785 --> 05:53.453
(whispers):
Lily has no idea I'm high.

05:53.455 --> 05:54.871
You're high?

05:54.873 --> 05:57.574
I'm sorry.

05:59.877 --> 06:03.046
(whispers):
Lily has no idea I'm high.

06:03.048 --> 06:04.798
Okay, well, if
your pregnant wife

06:04.800 --> 06:07.134
has to sit here
sober all night,

06:07.136 --> 06:10.020
she's gonna need
some of them nachos.

06:10.022 --> 06:11.722
You got it.

06:11.724 --> 06:13.223
Hey, dude, fork over
some of them nach...

06:13.225 --> 06:14.391
No, not his.

06:14.393 --> 06:15.925

I can't believe that our
last Groovapalooza was,

what, 12 years ago?

07:56.537 --> 07:58.487
I mean, time is

07:58.489 --> 08:00.689

08:22.179 --> 08:24.179
We've been walking
for, like, an hour

08:24.181 --> 08:25.848

found the nachos.

08:28.269 --> 08:31.904
Yo, you want
my nachos, bro?

08:31.906 --> 08:33.989
Thank you.

08:33.991 --> 08:37.409
My husband's been gone an hour
looking for these.

08:37.410 --> 08:40.913
If he can't even do that,
how can I trust him as a father?

08:40.914 --> 08:43.782
You can't, bro.
You can't.

09:17.184 --> 09:19.318
Oh.

09:23.656 --> 09:24.990
So, how'd it go with Kevin?

09:24.992 --> 09:27.493
Well, I was just about
to tell him...

09:27.495 --> 09:28.961
ok, Kevin...

09:28.963 --> 09:31.463
Erika, I've been meaning
to speak with you all night.

09:31.465 --> 09:32.864
Really?
What about

09:32.866 --> 09:35.217
About me bending your hard
little body over the railing

09:35.219 --> 09:37.369
of this boat
and copulating furiously

09:37.371 --> 09:40.005
while I admire
the New York City skyline.

09:40.007 --> 09:43.175
Or, if you're feeling dirty,
we can always face Jersey.

09:43.177 --> 09:44.393
Thoughts?

09:46.012 --> 09:48.096
(screams)
Jalapeño!

09:48.098 --> 09:49.881
And just a hint of coconut.

09:49.883 --> 09:51.216
(screams)

09:52.852 --> 09:55.270
Kevin hit his head,
he might have a concussion.

09:55.272 --> 09:58.023
So obviously
I couldn't tell him.

09:58.025 --> 09:59.274
What about you?

09:59.276 --> 10:01.893
Something even worse
happened to her.

10:01.895 --> 10:04.947
I got a tiny spot of wine
on my sleeve.

10:07.367 --> 10:09.368
I couldn't pile on.

10:09.370 --> 10:11.169
I'm not a monster.

10:12.038 --> 10:13.338
Where are they?

10:13.340 --> 10:15.591
Come on, forget
the nachos.

10:15.593 --> 10:17.909
Everyone here
is having fun.

10:17.911 --> 10:19.845
Look, even these guys.

10:19.847 --> 10:21.513
Check it out.

10:21.515 --> 10:25.667
Wow, music really does
bring people together.

10:25.669 --> 10:27.853
Ted? Ted!

10:27.855 --> 10:30.022
Creepy guitar guy
is following us.

10:30.024 --> 10:32.257
(ominous music plays)

10:32.259 --> 10:35.894
(both screaming)

10:35.896 --> 10:37.696
(panting)

10:37.698 --> 10:39.147
We did a whole nother lap.

10:39.149 --> 10:41.483
Oh, man, we missed like,
half the concert now.

10:41.485 --> 10:42.567
Come on, let's just go
back to our seats.

10:42.592 --> 10:43.792
Ted, Ted, Ted.

10:43.937 --> 10:45.737
The nacho line
was right here all along.

10:45.739 --> 10:47.422
(both laughing)

10:47.424 --> 10:50.542
So stupid.

10:50.544 --> 10:53.412
As soon as we dock,
I'm taking Kevin to the E.R.

10:53.414 --> 10:57.299
God, wish last night
never happened.

10:57.301 --> 10:59.668
(sighs)

10:59.670 --> 11:01.587
I don't.

11:01.589 --> 11:04.006
What do you mean?

11:04.008 --> 11:05.641
What if this whole thing,

11:05.643 --> 11:09.177
it isn't the story of how we
both made a horrible mistake

11:09.179 --> 11:11.063
and ruined our relationships,

11:11.065 --> 11:16.301
what if it's actually the story
of how we got back together?

11:16.303 --> 11:19.271
Okay, I'm gonna ask you
one last time.

11:19.273 --> 11:21.573
Is this what you want?

11:21.575 --> 11:23.241
It's what we both want!

11:23.243 --> 11:26.161
Why else are we rushing
to tell them what we did?

11:26.163 --> 11:28.747
On a boat!
That is a terrible idea!

11:28.749 --> 11:31.483
Barney, we tried this
and we failed.

11:31.485 --> 11:33.201
Why try again?

11:33.203 --> 11:35.253
Because I haven't stopped
thinking about you

11:35.255 --> 11:37.322
and you haven't stopped
thinking about me.

11:39.792 --> 11:41.510
It's such a mess.

11:41.512 --> 11:43.161
Why...

11:43.163 --> 11:45.263
Why do you even like me?

11:48.167 --> 11:49.935
I guess...

11:49.937 --> 11:53.855
'cause you're almost
as messed up as I.

11:57.677 --> 12:00.145
Well, there's the small issue

12:00.147 --> 12:02.114
that we're currently dating
other people.

12:02.116 --> 12:04.232
How about this?

12:04.234 --> 12:09.688
After we dock, let's each do
what we have to do,

12:09.690 --> 12:14.042
and then meet up at MacLaren's
at midnight and...

12:14.044 --> 12:16.294
talk about us.

12:18.915 --> 12:23.418
Don't forget
your mystery gift bags!

12:23.420 --> 12:25.337
They're condoms.

12:27.306 --> 12:29.808
We just went all the way
around again!

12:29.810 --> 12:31.009
Where the hell
are these nachos?!

12:31.011 --> 12:32.644
Who cares
about nachos?

12:32.646 --> 12:33.979
Oh, I love nachos, man!

12:33.981 --> 12:35.397
You gotta relax, man.

12:35.399 --> 12:38.433
You keep worrying about stuff
like nachos,

12:38.435 --> 12:40.235
you're gonna give yourself
a heart attack.

12:41.154 --> 12:43.105
- I'm going back in.
- Fine!

12:43.107 --> 12:46.191
Ha! Joke's on you!

12:46.193 --> 12:49.661
The nacho line was right here
all along!

12:55.168 --> 12:57.369
NARRATOR: <i>Robin and Barney</i>
<i>were finally off the boat.</i>

12:57.371 --> 12:59.121
<i>so they both assumed</i>
<i>it was going to be a lot easier</i>

12:59.123 --> 13:01.423
<i>to admit</i>
<i>what they had done.</i>

13:01.425 --> 13:03.175
Kevin...
Me first.

13:03.177 --> 13:05.260
Look, I don't want
to make too much out

13:05.262 --> 13:07.412
of saying "I love you"
for the first time.

13:07.414 --> 13:09.080
Any way I can jump in
with my thing?

13:09.082 --> 13:12.384
Robin... I love you.

13:13.469 --> 13:15.253
Okay, Nora, lo...
(gasps)

13:15.255 --> 13:16.755
NORA:
Mom! Dad!

13:16.757 --> 13:19.691
Hi, Nora, we
got in early!

13:20.760 --> 13:24.029
BOTH:
Should've done it on the boat.

13:30.963 --> 13:31.912
Ah!

13:31.914 --> 13:34.382
Hey, where's your friend?

13:34.384 --> 13:38.603
We missed almost the entire show
because he put his stupid quest

13:38.605 --> 13:41.222
for nachos ahead of our
friendship, so I bolted.

13:41.224 --> 13:44.192
Well, I'm just a creepy old
guitar player,

13:44.194 --> 13:47.195
but isn't any time spent
with a friend a blessing?

13:47.197 --> 13:49.897
And if nachos is all you seek...

13:49.899 --> 13:52.150
take mine, brother.

13:52.152 --> 13:54.402
Wow!

13:54.404 --> 13:55.820
Thank you.

13:55.822 --> 13:58.272
It's a sign, bro.

13:58.274 --> 13:59.574
It is.

13:59.576 --> 14:01.542
It's a sign
I should go find Marshall!

14:01.544 --> 14:03.211
(laughs)

14:03.213 --> 14:04.796
Marshall! Marshall!

14:08.050 --> 14:11.719
So, Barney, Nora's told us
so much about you,

14:11.721 --> 14:14.204
but we want to know everything.

14:14.229 --> 14:16.029
Uh, let's see. Suit, laser tag.

14:16.059 --> 14:17.809
I say "wait for it" a lot.
That's about it.

14:17.811 --> 14:18.976
You two must be exhausted.

14:18.978 --> 14:20.061
I'll make coffee.

14:21.597 --> 14:23.798
I'm so glad to see how happy
you both are.

14:23.800 --> 14:26.967
When you meet
the right person,

14:26.969 --> 14:28.519
you know it.

14:28.521 --> 14:30.304
You can't stop
thinking about them.

14:33.809 --> 14:35.326
They're your best friend...

14:37.656 --> 14:38.936
and your soul mate.

14:40.115 --> 14:43.367
<i>You can't wait to spend the</i>
<i>rest of your life with them.</i>

14:43.369 --> 14:47.138
No one and nothing else
can compare.

14:47.140 --> 14:50.541
Now, where the hell
is that coffee, eh?

14:50.543 --> 14:51.992
(chuckles)

14:54.463 --> 14:58.432
Look, Nora, there's something
I have to tell you.

15:00.719 --> 15:02.804
(ominous music plays)

15:02.806 --> 15:05.056
(groans)

15:05.058 --> 15:06.841
Heart attack.

15:06.843 --> 15:08.810
Oh, God, Ted was right.
I have to relax!

15:08.812 --> 15:09.894
Ted!

15:09.896 --> 15:11.479
- Marshall!
- Ted?

15:11.481 --> 15:13.147
Ted!
Marshall!

15:13.149 --> 15:14.515
Oh, Ted! Oh, Ted!

15:14.517 --> 15:16.818
I'm so sorry! You were right.

15:16.820 --> 15:19.237
No, Marshall, you...
Yeah, I was right.

15:19.239 --> 15:20.488
But look, nachos!

15:22.023 --> 15:24.108
Come on. Let's
go back inside.

15:24.110 --> 15:25.743
(audience cheering)

15:25.745 --> 15:27.528
That's it.

15:27.530 --> 15:29.363
It's over.

15:29.365 --> 15:31.799
We missed the whole show.

15:33.535 --> 15:35.903
So...

15:35.905 --> 15:38.506
yup, I love you.

15:38.508 --> 15:41.142
Look, Kevin...

15:41.144 --> 15:44.512
there's something
I have to tell you.

15:44.514 --> 15:45.847
I cheated on you.

15:47.366 --> 15:51.152
I don't even know
how to react.

15:51.154 --> 15:53.220
I am so sorry.

15:54.389 --> 15:57.391
I know I don't get
any second chances,

15:57.393 --> 16:00.862
but you will always be...

16:00.864 --> 16:03.164
Was this a one-time thing?

16:05.284 --> 16:08.252
Can you tell me
it didn't mean anything?

16:10.255 --> 16:12.173
No.

16:22.050 --> 16:24.585
I'm sorry, Ted.

16:24.587 --> 16:29.857
I still want to have fun,

16:29.859 --> 16:31.592
There's just not
enough time, you know?

16:31.594 --> 16:32.593
I know.

16:32.595 --> 16:36.931
It's all going by
so damn fast.

16:37.900 --> 16:39.283
Lily!

16:39.285 --> 16:42.236
Hey! Oh, Lily,
I'm so sorry

16:42.238 --> 16:44.739
that we ruined our night.
Yeah.

16:44.741 --> 16:46.123
What are you guys talking about?

16:46.125 --> 16:48.159
You've been gone less
than two minutes.

16:48.161 --> 16:50.628
NARRATOR:
<i>Kids, she was right.</i>

16:54.299 --> 16:55.883
TED:
My hand.

16:55.885 --> 16:57.635
Whoa!

16:57.637 --> 16:59.119
Ah! concert!

16:59.121 --> 17:00.805
Nachos! Ah!

17:02.758 --> 17:04.809
(laughs)
Music!

17:06.511 --> 17:07.895
(both scream)

17:10.632 --> 17:12.132
- Time!
- Nachos!

17:15.136 --> 17:16.136
Thank you!

17:16.137 --> 17:18.856
It's a sign, bro.

17:18.858 --> 17:20.441
Oh, oh...

17:20.443 --> 17:22.304
Heart attack!
Marshall!

17:22.329 --> 17:23.529
Marshall!

17:27.316 --> 17:29.166
BOTH:
Time...

17:33.121 --> 17:36.374
BOTH:
Lily!

17:36.376 --> 17:38.709
Marshall, do you get
what this means?

17:38.711 --> 17:40.294
Life isn't moving
too fast.

17:40.296 --> 17:42.213
We-we still have time
for everything

17:42.215 --> 17:43.931
And we're not gonna miss
the concert!

17:45.467 --> 17:46.834
I'm freaking out right now.

17:46.836 --> 17:49.520
- We gotta get out of here.
- Yeah.

17:49.522 --> 17:51.973
Do you guys know where
the ladies' room is?

17:51.975 --> 17:54.308
- No idea.
- Haven't seen it.

17:57.012 --> 17:59.480
Hey! How's it going?

17:59.482 --> 18:02.233
Oh, not great.
Nora and I broke up.

18:02.235 --> 18:04.318
Oh, my God, what happened?

18:04.320 --> 18:07.321
I don't really feel like getting
into it, but...

18:07.323 --> 18:09.189
I think the worst part is over.

18:12.577 --> 18:14.695
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:14.697 --> 18:16.080
- Hey, Kev.
- What's up, Kev?

18:16.082 --> 18:17.381
KEVIN:
How's it going, buddy?

18:17.383 --> 18:18.632
ROBIN:
Hey, guys.

18:18.634 --> 18:20.835
There's something
I have to tell you.

18:20.837 --> 18:22.036
Then don't.

18:22.038 --> 18:23.587
What?

18:23.589 --> 18:25.923
If there's one thing I've
learned as a therapist,

18:25.925 --> 18:29.760
it's that just because something
needs to be told

18:29.762 --> 18:32.179
doesn't always mean
it needs to be heard.

18:32.181 --> 18:36.183
Kevin, I did something bad.

18:36.185 --> 18:38.352
We've all done bad things.

18:38.354 --> 18:40.321
Doesn't mean we're bad people.

18:41.423 --> 18:42.656
Look, I don't care

18:42.658 --> 18:44.442
about every detail
from your past,

18:44.444 --> 18:46.610
and I hope you don't care
about mine either.

18:46.612 --> 18:49.330
What I do care about is you,

18:49.332 --> 18:54.234
and that from tonight forward,
you're in this as much as I am.

18:55.787 --> 18:57.455
What do you think?

18:57.457 --> 19:01.258
I'm such a mess.

19:03.078 --> 19:05.763
Why do you even like me?

19:05.765 --> 19:06.914
Come her

19:08.083 --> 19:12.353
I am constantly amazed
by the things you say,

19:12.355 --> 19:15.389
entranced by the things you do,

19:15.391 --> 19:19.977
and unlike a certain Jalapeño
Coconut Vodka martini,

19:19.979 --> 19:22.262
you're easy on the eye

19:23.899 --> 19:25.866
And if we're together
long enough,

19:25.868 --> 19:30.121
I hope that one day you see
yourself the way I see you.

19:33.909 --> 19:36.494
That's a pretty good answer.

19:36.496 --> 19:39.080
NARRATOR: <i>Sometimes hours</i>
<i>can feel like minutes</i>

19:39.082 --> 19:42.917
<i>and sometimes a single second</i>
<i>can last a lifetime.</i>

19:42.919 --> 19:47.671
<i>For Barney, the second that</i>
<i>would never end was this one.</i>

19:47.673 --> 19:49.757
(ticking)

19:52.761 --> 19:54.845
(ticking stops)

20:05.473 --> 20:08.142
Well, um, I should go.

20:08.144 --> 20:10.194
Tough night.

20:10.196 --> 20:11.245
I'm so sorry.

20:11.247 --> 20:13.280
Don't be. It's nothing.

20:16.484 --> 20:17.952
It feels good to be sober again.

20:17.954 --> 20:21.755
Man, how long have we been
sitting here, right?

20:21.757 --> 20:23.841
12 seconds and you're
in the wrong booth.

20:30.665 --> 20:32.466
I should go to bed.
