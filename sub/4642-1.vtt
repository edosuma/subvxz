00:19.698 --> 00:23.484
My name is Jerry Hartfeld.

00:23.485 --> 00:27.378
I run a video production company,
here in Anaheim, California.

00:28.110 --> 00:31.827
We focus mainly on
reality television shows.

00:31.862 --> 00:36.562
If you ever seen the show,
"Tornado Trackers", it's one of ours.

00:36.897 --> 00:39.360
A tape arrived in the mail.

00:39.530 --> 00:44.300
It was a pilot episode of a new reality
series called "Grave Encounters".

00:44.335 --> 00:47.978
And it was by a young
producer named Lance Preston.

00:48.113 --> 00:52.602
The idea was that him and his
group of paranormal investigators,

00:52.637 --> 00:57.507
would investigate ghost sightings and
hauntings and things of this nature.

00:57.542 --> 00:59.119
And this was, you know, years before

00:59.154 --> 01:01.955
all the other ghost haunting
shows that are out there now.

01:02.090 --> 01:04.497
I mean, I really felt
he was ahead of his time.

01:06.025 --> 01:07.967
My name is Lance Preston.

01:08.002 --> 01:10.461
When I was a boy my
family moved into a house

01:10.496 --> 01:12.192
that I soon discovered was haunted.

01:12.327 --> 01:15.427
The things I encountered,
have stayed with me forever.

01:15.462 --> 01:18.979
Ever since then, I have been
obsessed with trying to capture proof

01:19.014 --> 01:20.878
that these things were real.

01:21.013 --> 01:24.625
Come along with me and my team
of skilled paranormal investigators

01:24.653 --> 01:28.806
as we dare to venture into some of the
most haunted locations known to man.

01:29.053 --> 01:32.244
Spending the night, and
capturing everything on camera.

01:32.279 --> 01:35.364
If you're ready, it's
time to have some

01:35.399 --> 01:38.161
GRAVE ENCOUNTERS

01:38.396 --> 01:40.882
And everything was... you
know, going really smoothly.

01:40.917 --> 01:45.582
I mean, the edits that were coming back
were great.  We were very excited.

01:45.617 --> 01:47.628
We really had some thing, you know.

01:50.735 --> 01:53.784
And then of course, they
got the Episode 6.

01:53.819 --> 01:56.391
<i>Uh, do you have anything
else you want to say?</i>

01:57.484 --> 02:00.595
Yeah!  I want to be
very clear about this.

02:00.730 --> 02:02.535
What you're about to
see is not a movie.

02:02.570 --> 02:03.419
Okay?

02:03.420 --> 02:08.269
This is been assembled from some 76 plus
hours of raw mini DVD source footage

02:08.304 --> 02:09.803
that was shot for Lance's show.

02:11.126 --> 02:14.571
Not a frame of this had been doctored,
hasn't been manipulated in any way.

02:15.129 --> 02:19.105
This is just raw footage,
it's been edited strictly for time.

02:31.060 --> 02:32.189
Cut!

02:34.122 --> 02:35.777
Hello! Hello!
Testing! Testing.

02:35.982 --> 02:37.382
Lance Preston!

02:37.491 --> 02:40.704
Keep a good portion of this
in the back the whole time.

02:40.739 --> 02:42.277
I'm gonna move a little bit, but...

02:42.312 --> 02:44.084
- Are you ready then?
- I'm ready.

02:44.420 --> 02:47.305
You're still in the shot.
I can... I want to get you clean.

02:47.840 --> 02:50.734
- One step back.
- Well, good?

02:51.343 --> 02:52.188
Good evening!

02:52.189 --> 02:54.883
And welcome to another
episode of Grave Encounters.

02:54.918 --> 02:56.704
I'm your host,
Lance Preston, as always.

02:56.739 --> 02:59.257
And tonight I am very
excited to take you inside

02:59.292 --> 03:02.504
one of the most terrifying
locations I have ever seen.

03:02.639 --> 03:05.802
Behind me sits the
Collingwood Psychiatric hospital.

03:05.837 --> 03:08.840
It's one of six buildings
spread over 80 acres of land,

03:08.843 --> 03:09.940
just outside ...

03:12.668 --> 03:15.504
We are gonna pick it up from there.
I'm not gonna do from beginning part again.

03:15.539 --> 03:21.851
And between the years 1895 and 1960,
it played home to more than 80,000

03:21.852 --> 03:25.873
of Maryland's most mentally ill
and disturbed individuals.

03:25.908 --> 03:31.147
After its closure in 1963,
reports of ghostly apparitions,

03:31.182 --> 03:34.935
objects moving on their own.
And sometimes even the lunatic

03:34.936 --> 03:38.322
laughter of the patients
condemned to roam these halls.

03:38.357 --> 03:44.700
Tonight, my crew and I will be
performing an 8 hour lock down.

03:44.735 --> 03:48.613
Trapped inside, during the
peak hours of dead time.

03:48.614 --> 03:51.647
Using the most sophisticated
in ghost hunting equipment

03:51.682 --> 03:54.905
we will be in search of
what's become known as

03:55.042 --> 03:59.024
the ghost of the
Collingwood Psychiatric Hospital.

04:00.236 --> 04:01.535
- Cut.
- Nice!

04:01.661 --> 04:02.460
Yeah?

04:02.685 --> 04:03.848
- Morgan!
- Hi

04:03.849 --> 04:05.173
- Morgan Turner! How are you?
- Yeah.  Hi.

04:05.208 --> 04:07.176
- Oop! Perfect.
- Thanks for coming up man.

04:07.211 --> 04:08.889
Especially to make
you drive all the way.

04:08.924 --> 04:10.530
That's okay.
I'm really happy to do it.

04:10.532 --> 04:13.616
- Is um... is this going to be on TV?
- Yeah, that's what we hope.

04:13.651 --> 04:15.001
Hey, not this part.
I'm just shooting this.

04:15.036 --> 04:16.581
Oh, don't worry about it,
she shoots everything.

04:16.616 --> 04:19.577
I'm here with Morgan Turner,
local town historian.

04:19.577 --> 04:23.936
Morgan is here today to shed some
light on the institute's dark past.

04:24.425 --> 04:27.364
Morgan?  Can you tell us when
the institute was first built?

04:27.652 --> 04:32.752
Well! The history of Collingwood is fairly
typical of similar hospitals of the era.

04:32.787 --> 04:38.303
It was built in 1893... to
address the sort of growing

04:38.338 --> 04:41.616
over crowding problem at the
state hospital in Denver's County.

04:41.651 --> 04:45.059
Mental illness, of course at that time
was not very well understood and

04:45.152 --> 04:46.930
treatments were
still in their infancy.

04:47.178 --> 04:50.903
Psychiatric hospitals like this were
seen as sort of a dumping ground

04:50.938 --> 04:53.200
for embarrassing family
members rather then

04:53.204 --> 04:55.320
a place that they could
go to actually get help.

04:55.327 --> 04:56.050
Right.

04:56.053 --> 04:58.960
The conditions were pretty abysmal.

04:59.078 --> 05:05.100
People have to sleep on the floor, some
times, without blankets or even clothes.

05:05.102 --> 05:08.003
It was really not a
fun place to be stuck in.

05:08.029 --> 05:10.729
Could you tell us about
Arthur Friedkin?

05:10.930 --> 05:14.066
His story is probably the most
infamous about this hospital.

05:14.178 --> 05:17.034
Sure..!  I figured that
you're gonna ask me that.

05:17.202 --> 05:19.782
Friedkin was a
Harvard trained neurologist

05:19.929 --> 05:23.448
who was head physician
here from 1937 to 1948.

05:23.852 --> 05:27.003
He had gain some notoriety
because of his work in

05:27.004 --> 05:29.238
experimental brain surgery.

05:29.678 --> 05:32.670
He was a major
advocate of the lobotomy,

05:32.705 --> 05:36.921
under Friedkin supervision
there were about 140 lobotomies.

05:36.928 --> 05:40.487
On August 15, 1948,

05:40.730 --> 05:44.049
six patients broke out of their rooms

05:44.084 --> 05:46.300
and stabbed Friedkin
in his office.

05:46.305 --> 05:49.058
His body was found the
next morning by a nurse.

05:49.180 --> 05:53.880
Unfortunately, this event
was completely overshadowed

05:53.883 --> 05:56.525
by the death of David Bruce,
the famous baseball player.

05:57.732 --> 05:59.363
It's a crazy story!

05:59.631 --> 06:03.395
So Morgan, in your honest opinion.
Do you believe in ghosts?

06:04.985 --> 06:05.962
I don't know.

06:05.963 --> 06:10.931
But if they do exist, well, this would be
a good place to go looking for them.

06:11.193 --> 06:13.199
The traffic was busy today, so...

06:13.234 --> 06:15.764
Didn't take us too long, it was
about hour drive, something like that.

06:16.499 --> 06:18.431
- Oh God!
- "Death awaits."

06:19.322 --> 06:22.188
- I guess we'll find out.
- That is so lame!

06:23.303 --> 06:24.697
Ah, this will taking a bit, this

06:24.698 --> 06:27.813
old ancient lock here.
I don't even think we should use this.

06:27.873 --> 06:30.350
- You know, it's really cheesy dude.
- Yeah! I don't like that.

06:30.351 --> 06:33.632
Slow motion, music behind it.
Everything's creepy.

06:34.421 --> 06:37.857
- Okay.. come on.
- Good. Here we go.

06:37.972 --> 06:39.437
Okay, come on in.

06:41.985 --> 06:43.625
Oh my God!

06:44.684 --> 06:47.394
So this is the main entrance
to the building here.

06:48.077 --> 06:49.176
Nice!
Yes!

06:49.674 --> 06:50.677
Oh, ho ho, man!

06:50.703 --> 06:54.836
And if you were family member, you have
to check-in at the reception over there.

06:55.371 --> 06:57.542
- This is creepy as shit!
- This is so insane.

06:57.577 --> 06:58.860
Are you getting all this?
Get everything!

06:58.978 --> 07:01.176
I want to do camera
shots of all of this.

07:02.168 --> 07:03.472
Hey you down there.
No smoking, uh.

07:03.607 --> 07:07.801
Can you take that outside?  Don't
even bother inside, please.  Fire exit.

07:08.136 --> 07:12.697
I'm here with Kenny Sandavol.
Resident caretaker, for the past 8 years.

07:12.732 --> 07:16.494
Kenny!  Would you say
that this place is haunted?

07:17.521 --> 07:22.034
Well, I've never done this before.
So, should I talk to you or to the camera?

07:22.069 --> 07:23.404
Yeah..  Don't.
This isn't...

07:23.439 --> 07:28.855
Well, I don't know if I believe in
ghost or spirits or anything like that.

07:28.890 --> 07:31.828
But in my time here I've
seen some pretty weird stuff.

07:31.863 --> 07:33.897
You know, especially working
late night you hear all these

07:33.932 --> 07:37.546
old pipes and the building
sort of make noises and...

07:37.681 --> 07:40.860
Well, it's really hard to
put your finger on it.  But...

07:40.861 --> 07:43.557
I get the sense
that, I'm not alone.

07:45.155 --> 07:46.762
Lets go check it out!

07:47.497 --> 07:49.873
Aha.
Okay.

07:50.325 --> 07:52.571
Uh, like this hallways
go on forever.

07:52.588 --> 07:53.342
Yup!

07:53.383 --> 07:56.810
It's hard to believe this place used to
house thousands of insane people.

07:56.811 --> 07:57.530
There were thousands.

07:57.535 --> 08:00.503
Seem to have darkness
and it's still day time.

08:01.021 --> 08:02.971
- So where is the power socket?
- You scared?

08:04.785 --> 08:06.702
Ah, there's a few newer
lines you can plug into.

08:06.703 --> 08:08.032
I'll will show you where those are.

08:08.067 --> 08:12.030
Hey guys!  If you think it's
dark now, wait till tonight.

08:12.033 --> 08:14.304
Cause none of these lights work,
it'll get very dark.

08:14.660 --> 08:17.975
- So you guys see this window here?
- Yeah!

08:19.609 --> 08:21.261
I lock it up real good in night

08:21.284 --> 08:24.610
come back in morning, some
times this thing's wide open.

08:24.664 --> 08:25.876
What!

08:26.104 --> 08:27.477
Yeah, I can't figure it out.

08:27.860 --> 08:30.971
Its like a... something is
trying to get out or something.

08:32.251 --> 08:34.379
Its a definite paranormal hotspot.

08:36.900 --> 08:39.164
- How is it?
- Perfect.

08:48.181 --> 08:52.394
How is this supposed to help people
if their stuffed in these tiny rooms.

08:55.505 --> 08:58.103
- Oh my God!
- This is officially fucked!

08:58.138 --> 09:01.114
- Is this real?
- Yup, this is totally real.

09:01.835 --> 09:04.836
The guy who lived here was
in here for quite a few years

09:04.883 --> 09:06.885
and this is what he did.

09:07.160 --> 09:09.080
He spent his time
writing on the walls.

09:09.088 --> 09:11.165
So this is the actual
patiented room here?

09:11.166 --> 09:12.634
An actual patient was in here.

09:12.635 --> 09:13.820
Really?

09:13.827 --> 09:17.683
I don't know whether he was right to
the end, but he was here for a long time.

09:17.752 --> 09:19.152
Very creepy.

09:20.780 --> 09:25.043
- What the fuck!?  Kenny!
- This is great!

09:25.078 --> 09:28.098
Oh man, the acoustics
are shit in here.

09:28.885 --> 09:32.159
Supposedly a patient, a young
girl, killed herself in here.

09:32.194 --> 09:34.353
- What?
- Right here?

09:34.588 --> 09:38.715
- A patient killed herself, right here?
- Yes, slit her wrists in this tub.

09:38.749 --> 09:40.475
Oh God, that's so sad.

09:41.051 --> 09:44.300
People say they've heard the sound of
rustling water coming out of this room,

09:44.311 --> 09:46.649
but I've never heard
any thing like that.

09:46.979 --> 09:48.060
Where are we going next then?

09:48.061 --> 09:49.868
Ah, we gonna go down
to the service tunnels.

09:50.684 --> 09:52.748
Can't wait to see all this.

09:55.296 --> 09:56.364
You on it?

09:56.956 --> 10:00.397
- Oh Kenny!
- This is exactly what I was looking for!

10:00.408 --> 10:02.650
These service tunnels
connect all the buildings.

10:03.311 --> 10:05.765
There's about a quarter mile of them.

10:06.786 --> 10:10.953
It's like a maze down here.
You could easily get lost.

10:11.016 --> 10:15.171
One day, I was down here
walking over to the East wing,

10:16.472 --> 10:19.181
and the air got real cold.

10:19.535 --> 10:24.029
It was so still.  I felt like
someone was watching me.

10:25.458 --> 10:28.641
Very eerie feeling.

10:30.711 --> 10:33.615
- What?  What?
- It's just my shadow. Sorry.

10:35.316 --> 10:38.289
This is Garry Crawford.
Crawford Contracting.

10:38.324 --> 10:41.100
He was hired here, quite some
time ago, to do some work?

10:41.106 --> 10:42.290
Is that right?

10:42.359 --> 10:47.113
Back in 93, yeah.  The state was
gonna try and do some renovation here

10:47.176 --> 10:50.898
but eventually they shit-can the idea.
Oh shit, I'm sorry!

10:51.189 --> 10:52.860
- You want me not to swear?
- Yeah, that would be better.

10:52.865 --> 10:55.364
Anyway, me and my guys

10:55.365 --> 10:57.753
came in here for about two weeks.

10:57.788 --> 11:00.663
And you experienced some
supernatural phenomenon?

11:02.218 --> 11:03.725
Well, we were off to start,

11:03.726 --> 11:07.699
some of the guys were hearing what
they thought were weird noises and...

11:07.834 --> 11:10.859
And there were some tools
disappearing over night,

11:10.894 --> 11:14.983
I thought it was looters, but
I never saw anybody, so...

11:15.018 --> 11:17.730
- There was an accident?
- Yeah...

11:17.833 --> 11:22.179
One of my guys on a ladder, in fact, he
was pulling some old wood just over there.

11:22.214 --> 11:25.908
And he swears that something
pushed him off the ladder.

11:25.909 --> 11:27.103
He took a hard fall.

11:27.138 --> 11:30.496
Banged up his knee, and he quit!

11:30.531 --> 11:33.133
Well! that doesn't sound
like a residual haunting.

11:33.168 --> 11:34.675
Its sounds like an
intelligent haunting.

11:36.613 --> 11:40.231
A residual haunting is thought
to be like an echo from the past,

11:40.233 --> 11:42.904
continuing to loop
over and over again.

11:42.939 --> 11:46.120
An intelligent haunting
is actually a spirit

11:46.155 --> 11:48.377
that interacts and has intention.

11:48.412 --> 11:50.857
There are many reports
of people having

11:50.892 --> 11:53.425
been pushed, scratched
and even thrown.

11:53.496 --> 11:56.169
It's rare but it does happen.

11:56.210 --> 11:59.039
So, you both have spent
a lot of time out here?

11:59.585 --> 12:03.775
Yeah, all in high school with bunch of
kids used to come down here and just...

12:03.961 --> 12:05.321
you know, for hang out.

12:05.330 --> 12:06.475
And you saw something here?

12:07.290 --> 12:08.065
Yes.

12:08.100 --> 12:11.394
We were actually right here.

12:11.529 --> 12:15.614
Here.  Making out or whatever... and

12:16.021 --> 12:18.662
I looked up and I swear to God.

12:18.663 --> 12:23.642
I swear to God that I saw someone
right at the end of the hall there.

12:23.946 --> 12:28.969
- He was wearing a... like a white...
- Like a hospital gown?

12:28.970 --> 12:34.328
Yeah, like a white hospital gown.
And he had shaved head. Yeah.

12:36.293 --> 12:38.732
Full spectral apparition.

12:38.838 --> 12:41.272
Why don't we... why don't we grab
an interview with gardener look like?

12:41.373 --> 12:43.572
<i>As long as the lights doesn't...</i>

12:43.612 --> 12:47.162
Excuse me! Excuse me sir!
Excuse me.

12:47.726 --> 12:48.921
I'm shooting a TV show here.

12:48.922 --> 12:51.230
Just wondering if you want to
do a quick interview with us.

12:52.530 --> 12:55.579
I am standing here with the
resident gardener, Javier Ortega.

12:55.649 --> 12:59.364
Javier, have you ever noticed
anything strange around the building?

12:59.672 --> 13:02.556
No.  Not really.
What do you mean?

13:02.591 --> 13:06.732
Well, have you heard any weird
noises or seen any ghostly activity?

13:06.821 --> 13:08.489
I just start to working here.

13:09.279 --> 13:10.647
Just started working.
That's great.

13:10.672 --> 13:13.017
TC can you... ?
Just cut for a sec?

13:13.018 --> 13:14.708
Okay, how about you make
something up for the camera?

13:14.771 --> 13:16.984
Pretend you saw something?
Just...

13:17.071 --> 13:19.369
- I got to get go on to work!
- Okay. Okay.

13:19.720 --> 13:24.396
Wait! Wait, wait... No, no just wait.
Do you have any of the  petty cash or...?

13:26.520 --> 13:29.161
Hey Javier, how does 20 bucks sound?

13:29.268 --> 13:32.438
I am standing here with the
resident gardener, Javier Ortega.

13:32.491 --> 13:35.641
Javier, have you ever seen
anything strange in the past

13:35.642 --> 13:37.240
10 years of working here?

13:37.844 --> 13:40.951
Yeah, I saw a ghost.
Over here.

13:41.663 --> 13:43.533
It was really scary.

13:44.565 --> 13:48.266
A ghost on the exterior of
the building.  Unbelievable.

13:48.333 --> 13:50.383
This is really a paranormal hotspot

13:50.384 --> 13:53.434
unlike anything, we've
ever shot at before.

13:53.459 --> 13:55.929
On three, two, one ...

13:58.183 --> 14:04.084
Because of this location's massive size
and scope, I've called in psychic medium

14:04.109 --> 14:07.064
Houston Grey to assist
in the investigation.

14:08.937 --> 14:12.111
Houston!
Are you sensing anything?

14:13.135 --> 14:18.082
Oh wow!  Wow!  Oh, there's
such an incredible energy here!

14:18.461 --> 14:21.582
It's like hundreds of
voices all talking at once.

14:21.617 --> 14:23.145
The sound is deafening!

14:23.689 --> 14:25.396
There is something else.

14:32.389 --> 14:35.288
I..I... There's something else here.

14:35.291 --> 14:38.083
It's... like a dark spirit.

14:38.564 --> 14:40.370
It might even possibly be a demon.

14:40.387 --> 14:43.378
Now we have got to be
extremely cautious tonight, Lance.

14:43.413 --> 14:47.744
We do not want to be messing
with something like this, at all.

14:51.439 --> 14:53.023
This is it!

14:53.164 --> 14:55.345
Houston, are you feeling anything?

14:55.880 --> 14:57.626
Yeah.

14:58.150 --> 15:02.638
I'm sensing deep
well of sadness in here.

15:02.775 --> 15:04.613
A profound sadness.

15:06.625 --> 15:11.224
I see a patient.
A female patient.

15:11.352 --> 15:18.668
A girl. There is water,
red... red water.

15:19.503 --> 15:30.089
Blood. Blood.  She died right in here.
She slit her wrists in the bathtub.

15:30.424 --> 15:33.927
The caretaker said a girl
killed herself right here.

15:34.162 --> 15:36.462
Houston!
That's incredible.

15:37.397 --> 15:40.361
The spirit is still with us.

15:43.775 --> 15:45.374
Cut it.

15:45.699 --> 15:46.598
Yeah!

15:48.223 --> 15:50.020
- Okay!  Was that too much?
- No.

15:50.021 --> 15:51.430
Come on.
How was it guys?

15:51.431 --> 15:53.627
No, no, no. That was great.
That sounded very real.

15:56.348 --> 15:58.851
Hey Lance!
How do you feel about Show 6?

15:59.786 --> 16:01.777
Feeling good.
It's a good location.

16:01.885 --> 16:03.859
Do you think we're actually going
to see some ghosts this time?

16:04.238 --> 16:06.534
Oh yeah! Hundreds of them.
I'm sure.

16:06.569 --> 16:09.555
Wow!  Maybe you try to
sound a little less skeptical.

16:09.640 --> 16:12.938
I mean, it would be great.
But if we don't, then... you know

16:12.939 --> 16:16.329
whatever, we just want to make sure
we can get some good scares. That's all.

16:16.964 --> 16:19.065
Oh!  Oh, oh hey, TC!

16:19.066 --> 16:22.072
Uh, you want to get
a nice crime lab shot?

16:25.597 --> 16:27.710
Dude, the ground's slippery.

18:09.851 --> 18:14.632
Okay, this is creepy as shit.
I am getting out of here.

18:25.075 --> 18:29.556
Alright, we are about to check in with our
resident Grave Encounters tech wizard, Matt.

18:29.600 --> 18:33.175
Matt!  Why don't you walk us through
some of what are you're doing here?

18:33.225 --> 18:34.643
I've set up ten static cameras

18:34.679 --> 18:36.927
around the hotspots of ghost activity.

18:37.053 --> 18:38.651
So they record constantly the tape.

18:38.777 --> 18:40.809
They are also recording
to a backup hard drive.

18:40.844 --> 18:44.029
And everything gets wirelessly
transmitted back to my computer.

18:44.330 --> 18:45.867
So I'll know what's
happening all the time.

18:45.868 --> 18:46.714
Real quick Matt!

18:46.715 --> 18:49.674
Why don't you walk to us through
what some of the equipment is for?

18:49.709 --> 18:52.353
This is an EMF meter.
And what this does is

18:52.354 --> 18:55.737
it records electrostatic and
electromagnetic fields in the air.

18:55.772 --> 18:57.254
So the basic idea is that

18:57.255 --> 19:00.251
man-made or human EMF
fields will remain stable.

19:00.286 --> 19:01.906
While fields caused by

19:01.907 --> 19:04.482
paranormal activity will
produce spikes in the reading.

19:04.517 --> 19:06.306
Infrared thermometer.

19:06.307 --> 19:10.810
Okay, it's the same idea as the EMF, only
it's used to detect drops in air temperature.

19:10.845 --> 19:14.354
Ghosts are believed to cause
dramatic drop offs in air temperature,

19:14.379 --> 19:16.584
known in the paranormal
community as cold spots.

19:16.719 --> 19:19.145
Testing one, two, three ...

19:19.480 --> 19:22.582
- This is a simple analog audio recorder.
- All right.

19:22.659 --> 19:25.919
- It's used to capture EVPs.
- Oh, now real quick ...

19:26.054 --> 19:29.205
For the audience at home,
explain, what an EVP is...

19:29.206 --> 19:31.191
EVP is Electronic Voice Phenomena

19:31.230 --> 19:34.853
This thing will actually pick up sounds
that the human ear cannot detect.

19:35.058 --> 19:37.759
So when we play it back,
if we hear something,

19:37.809 --> 19:41.164
we'll know that something out there
is trying to communicate with us.

19:41.183 --> 19:43.982
Okay. This is my favorite.
This is a Geiger counter.

19:44.007 --> 19:46.315
You just turn the sound right here,
and you're good to go.

19:46.318 --> 19:48.326
I mean, look at this!
This is freaking bad ass!

19:48.327 --> 19:49.468
<i>That's bad ass.</i>

19:49.469 --> 19:52.242
Listen!, I can guarantee you,
that if there is anything paranormal,

19:52.243 --> 19:55.564
anything freaky happening in
this joint, we gonna catch it.

19:55.858 --> 19:58.921
Alright folks, we're about
to initiate lock down.

19:58.992 --> 20:01.277
My friend Kenny here, the
building's care taker

20:01.312 --> 20:04.039
will be doing us the honor
of sealing us inside.

20:04.074 --> 20:07.862
Kenny, thanks very much, man!
See you at 6 am.

20:08.032 --> 20:10.240
Okay, 6 am sharp.
Good luck!

20:14.425 --> 20:17.133
I am a demon.
A demon child.

20:17.468 --> 20:19.318
I can't wait to see you
there in the morning.

20:22.623 --> 20:25.177
Yeah, you see, we got to spend the
night with these two freaks.

20:25.812 --> 20:28.518
What are you doing?
I'm on with Kenny.

20:29.087 --> 20:30.053
Dude, did you lock the door?

20:30.054 --> 20:32.440
What do you mean?  It's great for
the show, man.  Don't worry about it.

20:32.442 --> 20:34.208
What if I have to get
more equipment after that?

20:34.421 --> 20:37.326
All right!
This is the real deal folks!

20:37.746 --> 20:41.968
This is the by far the biggest
location we have ever investigated

20:41.971 --> 20:43.950
and the most dangerous.

20:44.096 --> 20:46.520
Now, I want to put
emphasis on fact that

20:46.525 --> 20:49.420
this facility was built
very much like a prison.

20:49.423 --> 20:52.014
All the windows are barred.
We literally

20:52.075 --> 20:54.519
could not get out of
here if we wanted to.

20:54.545 --> 20:58.607
We are trapped inside,
until Kenny the caretaker

20:58.642 --> 21:00.422
comes to get us in the morning.

21:00.473 --> 21:02.661
We will be working
in pitch dark.

21:02.696 --> 21:06.580
Capturing everything on three
night vision capable cameras.

21:06.615 --> 21:09.771
Along with the static cams
that Matt set up for us

21:09.806 --> 21:11.031
on our hotspots.

21:11.066 --> 21:16.250
All right everyone! If  you are
ready, it's time to have some

21:16.285 --> 21:18.487
Grave Encounters!

21:19.700 --> 21:22.754
Okay, we're
now roaming the

21:22.789 --> 21:25.866
vast darkness of the
hallways of the institute.

21:27.324 --> 21:30.281
Hallways that have been
abandoned for more than 50 years.

21:30.749 --> 21:34.917
We are in search of spirits
that are unsettled in life

21:35.674 --> 21:38.467
and possibly unsettled
in the afterlife.

21:39.398 --> 21:43.588
- I sense down here is cold
- Cold is right.

21:44.023 --> 21:46.270
This is the hallway
where the apparition

21:46.277 --> 21:47.845
of the patient
with the shaved head,

21:47.849 --> 21:51.412
was seen floating down
at the end of the hallway.

21:52.075 --> 21:54.161
Sasha, Let's do that EVP.

21:54.999 --> 21:57.748
Is there somebody with us?

22:00.226 --> 22:02.437
Are you a patient here?

22:03.050 --> 22:06.852
- Did you use to live in the hospital?
- Play back.

22:07.527 --> 22:09.456
<i>"Is there somebody with us?"</i>

22:12.942 --> 22:14.806
<i>"Are you a patient here?"</i>

22:17.003 --> 22:19.013
<i>"Did you use to live in the hospital?"</i>

22:23.563 --> 22:24.819
There's nothing.

22:26.005 --> 22:27.700
- All right.  One sec...
- I feel like it just sort of a ...

22:27.703 --> 22:30.479
Spirit, you have
nothing to fear from us.

22:30.726 --> 22:34.084
If you are here, show yourself!

22:34.454 --> 22:37.775
I think it's getting colder as we
go on.  It's drawing us this way.

22:37.776 --> 22:39.392
It wants us to go this way.

22:40.027 --> 22:45.408
If there's a spirit here with us,
we want you to give us a sign.

22:46.829 --> 22:48.385
Open the window!

22:48.453 --> 22:50.989
Even just a nudge.

22:58.880 --> 23:05.565
I'm going to use, this still camera to
try to capture paranormal anomalies.

23:05.566 --> 23:07.654
They're not usually
seen by the human eye.

23:07.689 --> 23:10.677
It's better known
as spirit photography.

23:17.153 --> 23:18.278
One more.

23:19.382 --> 23:21.774
We gonna have to wait for
the pictures to be developed.

23:22.006 --> 23:26.007
If there is a ghost behind
me, we won't know until later.

23:31.029 --> 23:33.898
Are you the one, who
wrote on these walls?

23:35.233 --> 23:37.478
Or are you trying to communicate?

23:43.082 --> 23:45.694
Why don't you try and
communicate with me now?

23:52.606 --> 24:02.558
If the patient who killed herself in this
room, in this very tub, is here now,

24:04.359 --> 24:06.930
make yourself known.

24:11.559 --> 24:13.388
I'm really creeped out in here.

24:14.982 --> 24:19.365
Alright, camera 2 and 4 have...
Temperature readings are nominal.

24:24.110 --> 24:26.807
Guys, why do I have to be the
one that sits here by myself?

24:28.733 --> 24:31.054
Houston, do you feel anything?

24:31.959 --> 24:36.308
I'm feeling a very, very
negative dark energy here.

24:36.343 --> 24:42.731
And not just a single energy, a
lot of energy.  Many, many spirits.

24:43.266 --> 24:48.665
If there are any spirits down
here, please show yourselves!

24:51.946 --> 24:53.888
Make a noise for us.

24:54.469 --> 24:59.753
As we said before, it seems like
these tunnels just go on forever.

25:01.998 --> 25:03.859
It stinks in here too.

25:04.494 --> 25:07.621
- Oh, did you hear that?
- I heard that too.

25:12.846 --> 25:16.900
- Okay, we just heard something.
- What the fuck was that?

25:16.917 --> 25:20.114
I don't know, come here.
Over this way. You guys, follow me.

25:21.028 --> 25:23.569
<i>- How is it? Where is it coming from?
- I think this door.</i>

25:23.947 --> 25:26.684
Just down over here.
You want to open this?

25:26.685 --> 25:28.704
You can swing your
camera around and get in?

25:28.873 --> 25:33.156
Yeah, not really, but...
God damn it!

25:36.674 --> 25:39.026
<i>Oh!
Whoa... yucks!</i>

25:40.624 --> 25:42.647
<i>- Rats!
- Are you frigging crazy?</i>

25:42.648 --> 25:43.933
- No way, man!
- Really?

25:43.934 --> 25:46.153
<i>It's not that big of a deal.</i>

25:46.354 --> 25:47.563
Awesome!

25:48.200 --> 25:51.387
<i>- You're such a dork!
- You see, its not funny!</i>

25:51.962 --> 25:54.064
This place is as haunted as a ...

25:54.065 --> 25:56.730
<i>It really is scary.
I honestly scared, okay so...</i>

25:56.731 --> 26:00.867
<i>Sitting in a graveyard, an
inflamed guy is murdering his wife...</i>

26:50.648 --> 26:54.782
Could this be residual
ectoplasmic material

26:54.783 --> 26:58.339
discovered first by the
Grave Encounters team?

26:58.826 --> 27:02.714
Okay, I think we should just do
one more walk-through upstairs.

27:02.855 --> 27:04.944
Give me some V camera
shots down the hallways,

27:04.945 --> 27:07.101
get some of that...
floaty hallway stuff.

27:07.393 --> 27:10.103
Like we did at Plain View Mansion.

27:10.104 --> 27:12.863
Yeah exactly, exactly...
Stuff we can cut into.

27:53.631 --> 27:55.343
Lance you are going to love me.

27:56.378 --> 27:58.454
Mmm...
Shit!

28:01.845 --> 28:06.743
How do you like this?
Hold on, hold on, hold on...

28:10.994 --> 28:13.610
Yes, my dear?

28:13.615 --> 28:16.525
Come on.  Why was
she crying on the phone?

28:18.045 --> 28:19.544
Hi pumpkin!

28:19.969 --> 28:22.270
What's this mummy tells me,
you're afraid of

28:22.272 --> 28:24.070
monsters under the bed?

28:24.195 --> 28:26.443
Didn't we have this conversation?

28:27.278 --> 28:31.297
Monsters aren't real, baby.
They aren't real.

28:31.332 --> 28:34.618
Even they were real, they
wouldn't want to come to our house.

28:35.053 --> 28:37.998
Because you know Daddy will
take care of them for you.

28:39.093 --> 28:42.714
Tell mummy I gave you permission
to lay in bed with her tonight.

28:42.715 --> 28:44.641
Your Daddy won't be
home until morning.

28:44.676 --> 28:48.157
We'll go out for pizza tomorrow, ok?
Dad will be home soon.

28:48.882 --> 28:50.342
Bye bye.

29:08.541 --> 29:10.573
God damn! Its cold in here.

29:12.274 --> 29:14.248
What the fuck was that!

29:14.583 --> 29:18.302
Guys, cut this shit!
I'm not fucking playing!

29:20.261 --> 29:22.539
Ain't the fucking
time to do this shit!

29:23.739 --> 29:25.395
What the fuck!

29:28.974 --> 29:30.451
Hey!
Where are you guys?

29:30.455 --> 29:31.708
Maybe it was the wind or something.

29:33.226 --> 29:36.210
That's solid, alright.  Nothing short
of a tornado is gonna move that.

29:36.223 --> 29:37.235
How much do you think that weighs?

29:37.270 --> 29:39.421
Hey TC, how did it move?
Was it like...?

29:39.480 --> 29:41.478
Whatever it was, it scared
the crap out of me, right.

29:41.479 --> 29:42.709
I have to change my shorts
and I'm getting out of here.

29:42.744 --> 29:43.910
<i>Can you explain it?
I...</i>

29:43.945 --> 29:47.484
I just told you, man.  I was
taping, I turned around like this.

29:47.485 --> 29:48.678
The thing just closed.
And I...

29:48.713 --> 29:51.128
- I thought it was you guys, at first, right?
- You were taping it?

29:51.129 --> 29:52.229
<i>You taped?</i>

29:52.316 --> 29:54.824
I told you that in the first place.
If you guys weren't so busy like...

29:54.825 --> 29:56.773
<i>- Is it you frigging have it on the tape?
- You got it on tape?</i>

29:56.774 --> 29:57.772
Check that out!

29:59.050 --> 30:01.528
- Boy!
- Oh my God!

30:01.863 --> 30:04.697
<i>Okay, that's freaky.
Yeah.</i>

30:05.232 --> 30:08.299
I accept your apology,
I accept your apology.

30:08.300 --> 30:10.076
I cannot believe that you saw that!

30:10.111 --> 30:14.338
Incredible footage you saw just
moments ago, was captured by

30:14.373 --> 30:15.350
cameramen TC.

30:15.785 --> 30:19.948
This door directly behind
me slammed on its own.

30:19.983 --> 30:22.453
Now there's no drafts in room,

30:22.454 --> 30:25.364
there's no windows that could
have caused it to slam on its own.

30:25.574 --> 30:30.872
We are now going to
attempt to make contact.

30:34.395 --> 30:40.326
Is there someone here with us?
Please make a noise.

30:42.232 --> 30:43.601
Tap on something.

30:46.828 --> 30:48.930
Feel free
to slam the door

30:49.046 --> 30:52.300
like you did on TC
just moments ago.

30:52.905 --> 30:55.204
Feel free to slam it
as hard as you like.

30:55.939 --> 30:57.093
So go ahead.

30:57.828 --> 30:59.142
Slam it!

31:02.799 --> 31:06.027
Right wow, please!
Give us a sign!

31:08.005 --> 31:12.814
Spirit, I invoke you to make
an appearance.  Take out...

31:13.769 --> 31:20.201
With... If there is anyone here,
give us a sign...  Fuck!

31:20.202 --> 31:24.396
Fuck!  I thought we were actually
going to have something here.

31:25.818 --> 31:27.271
<i>What the fuck was that?</i>

31:27.272 --> 31:29.130
<i>Jesus Christ!
It was here...</i>

31:29.133 --> 31:30.444
That was really fucking scary guys.

31:30.479 --> 31:32.851
That came from right... right here!

31:37.612 --> 31:38.905
Shit, I can't see anything.

31:39.071 --> 31:40.090
Do you hear that?

31:43.993 --> 31:45.073
<i>What's that?</i>

31:46.164 --> 31:48.356
<i>- What?
- Oh shit...</i>

31:49.157 --> 31:50.718
<i>Holy shit!</i>

31:56.378 --> 31:57.326
<i>Hello!</i>

32:00.836 --> 32:04.130
- What's if...?
- This is really fucked up guys.

32:04.831 --> 32:07.588
- I'm going to...
- What the fuck is that guys?

32:07.589 --> 32:08.823
- What the fuck is that?
- What's up there?

32:08.824 --> 32:12.587
Matt.  Hey Matt, is there
anybody up on Four?

32:12.922 --> 32:15.755
Anybody up on any floor above us?

32:16.562 --> 32:17.897
No.
What the hell is going on?

32:17.898 --> 32:21.014
Obviously, somebody is fucking around
if they know we're shooting here.

32:21.049 --> 32:22.543
Why are we going up here last?

32:22.836 --> 32:26.191
Because this is where the
sound came from.  Jesus Christ.

32:27.460 --> 32:28.158
Hello!

32:28.988 --> 32:29.977
Is there anybody up here?

32:29.978 --> 32:32.167
<i>If someone's here, why
are they fucking with us?</i>

32:33.510 --> 32:37.698
Listen! If there's anybody here
trying to fuck with us, its not funny!

32:37.733 --> 32:41.731
Alright, we'll call the police!
We have a right to be here!

32:41.766 --> 32:43.567
We have a permit, and you don't!

32:43.581 --> 32:45.881
- Hey, can you lower your fucking voice.
- I'm just trying to talk!

32:45.906 --> 32:49.283
- You guys, you guys quiet.
Well, this is something real.

32:53.389 --> 32:55.042
I gonna do EVP.

32:57.984 --> 32:59.153
What's your name?

33:00.438 --> 33:01.727
What do you want?

33:04.462 --> 33:05.890
Are you in the room with us?

33:06.988 --> 33:08.166
Where are you?

33:08.251 --> 33:09.742
Come on, Sasha.
Play back

33:11.337 --> 33:12.442
"What's your name?"

33:13.462 --> 33:14.672
"What do you want?"

33:16.087 --> 33:17.936
"Are you in the room with us?"

33:20.309 --> 33:21.441
"Where are you?"

33:22.007 --> 33:24.565
What's that sound?
No, no, no.  What is that?

33:29.660 --> 33:32.163
What the fuck was that?
What the fuck was that?

33:32.264 --> 33:34.032
- Did you get that?
- Did you see that?

33:35.183 --> 33:37.194
- No way!
- I got it on tape

33:37.568 --> 33:38.744
Sasha!

33:39.531 --> 33:43.342
Please, please, can't even
find you there ... at the lobby!

33:46.980 --> 33:49.316
I need to get out of here.
I need to get out of here right now.

33:49.517 --> 33:51.837
I can't even view.
What are you thinking?

33:52.004 --> 33:54.344
- Just wait a second.
- Wait for what?

33:55.330 --> 33:57.596
We've been shooting this show
for what?  Five episodes?

33:57.628 --> 34:00.250
We've never seen
anything like that before.

34:00.253 --> 34:03.702
I don’t even care!  And I just
need to get the fuck out of here!

34:03.820 --> 34:07.142
Fine!  Houston, you take her down
there and you come right back, okay?

34:07.256 --> 34:09.119
- I think I'll stay down there as well.
No, no.

34:09.181 --> 34:11.094
I need another face on camera.

34:11.103 --> 34:13.411
Lance, I'm really thinking,
I don't think I can do this. I...

34:13.469 --> 34:16.895
Be a fucking professional will you?
Alright.  Stay in the character.

34:16.929 --> 34:19.250
We are on to something here.
Alright!

34:19.251 --> 34:20.476
Don't do this to me

34:20.511 --> 34:24.077
Alright, I'll come back.
Come on sweetheart.

34:24.112 --> 34:27.527
No no no!  TC you're
with me, man. Come on.

34:27.762 --> 34:30.496
Are you kidding me?
Did you see that shit?

34:30.531 --> 34:34.665
We don't get that kind of thing again
man!  You're fucking making millions!

34:35.956 --> 34:39.067
Just moments ago
in this very hallway

34:39.101 --> 34:42.516
we captured undeniable
proof of the paranormal.

34:42.552 --> 34:48.943
Sasha was terrified to the bone because
a ghost actually manipulated her hair.

34:49.478 --> 34:53.509
We're going to try to
attempt to make contact now.

34:56.580 --> 34:59.229
To the Spirit, who
dwells in the hallway

34:59.264 --> 35:03.555
we implore you to show us a sign.

35:03.590 --> 35:05.292
Manifest yourself!

35:06.627 --> 35:07.753
Please!

35:10.105 --> 35:15.106
If you're still with us...
give us a sign.

35:15.302 --> 35:18.975
Make a noise or...
manipulate my hair.

35:22.530 --> 35:24.831
Do you see anything?

35:24.857 --> 35:28.425
No.  Wait.  Give me the
light... no, nothing.

35:28.483 --> 35:32.436
- Don't even think of asking ...
- We are a team.

35:32.471 --> 35:33.729
I think its gone.

35:33.764 --> 35:36.997
You what I think, honestly.
I think it had its fun...

35:37.032 --> 35:39.824
It played this little prank and it
took off.  Maybe that's all they do...

35:39.859 --> 35:41.616
I don't know.
I mean, I don't know.

35:41.651 --> 35:45.238
Come on, you some fucking
in here, do something.

35:45.905 --> 35:48.729
You did it before, do it again.

35:48.864 --> 35:51.070
Are you fucking scared?

35:56.058 --> 35:59.145
Jesus Christ.
Fuck, forget it.

35:59.187 --> 36:02.094
Lance!  Its gone ...
Its left us ...

36:02.095 --> 36:04.983
I'm sensing that it's toying with us.

36:05.018 --> 36:07.223
-  Couldn't have said more...
- Shit.  Give it a rest.

36:07.258 --> 36:08.824
Could we go home now?

36:09.263 --> 36:14.065
Lance, there are people who chase Bigfoot,
look for Loch Ness their whole lives.

36:14.100 --> 36:15.546
All right.

36:15.781 --> 36:18.007
<i>TC, what time is it?</i>

36:18.042 --> 36:19.283
<i>It's 4:40.</i>

36:19.418 --> 36:22.742
<i>So let's go home, man.
When did that guy say he's coming again?</i>

36:22.782 --> 36:24.797
Hey you guys, I think
we have enough footage.

36:24.798 --> 36:27.924
Why don't we just pack up
everything and we get out of here.

36:27.959 --> 36:30.898
<i>- Okay! So we are...
- Yay... We're going home.</i>

36:33.075 --> 36:35.357
I think it's just right up ahead.

36:37.802 --> 36:39.332
Are you sure?

36:39.829 --> 36:42.488
Yeah, this is it.
This is it.

36:42.489 --> 36:43.903
<i>I don't think so.</i>

36:46.154 --> 36:50.930
<i>- This is this the way, right?
- Oh for the look! Fuck, it's a dead end.</i>

36:50.931 --> 36:52.124
<i>Guys.</i>

36:54.754 --> 36:56.560
<i>You see, that's not...
that's not the way. Wait...</i>

36:56.565 --> 36:58.391
Come on, come on!

36:58.426 --> 37:01.437
<i>- TC roll on this, man.
- Roll on what?</i>

37:01.483 --> 37:03.611
<i>- After we're lost?
- We're not lost.</i>

37:04.406 --> 37:06.465
We're not lost,
we came this way ...

37:06.466 --> 37:12.756
And Matt?  Hey Matt, you are...
Are you at the station?

37:12.839 --> 37:14.586
Matt! We're lost in here, man.

37:14.621 --> 37:18.234
We need...
We need some info.

37:19.482 --> 37:21.744
Why the fuck isn't he answering?

37:21.960 --> 37:24.957
- I'm not going that way TC!
- Why not?

37:24.992 --> 37:27.142
Because I'm going back over here.

37:27.259 --> 37:33.001
Yeah.  We... if we stay in one direction,
then we're gonna get there okay?

37:33.036 --> 37:34.900
It's what?
North?

37:34.964 --> 37:37.100
In there and around
the corner, is where

37:37.101 --> 37:39.344
the bathtub was, you know
where the girl killed herself.

37:39.424 --> 37:43.216
Hey, we've been this way before,
we've been this way before TC.

37:43.326 --> 37:46.729
I'm not trying to fight with you.  Just
explain to me when we saw this tub again.

37:46.730 --> 37:48.682
Because this is not the same
fucking tub.  I know it's not.

37:48.771 --> 37:51.780
- TC, come on get up, man.
- You said 6 o'clock?

37:51.937 --> 37:54.336
- Are you gonna sleep there?
- Is Kenny coming at 6 o'clock?

37:54.337 --> 37:56.170
- I'm not waiting.
- Yeah, he's coming at 6 o'clock.

37:56.172 --> 37:59.288
<i>I'm not waiting for you man.
I'm not waiting.</i>

38:17.594 --> 38:20.698
Where the hell were you guys?  You
all hear me calling you on the walkie?

38:20.699 --> 38:21.447
<i>Yeah, you know what?</i>

38:21.448 --> 38:24.499
<i>Two tin cans with a fucking
string on it would have been better.</i>

38:24.685 --> 38:26.707
- We got lost.
- Something wrong with your walkie-talkies?

38:26.808 --> 38:28.305
No!  I was calling you guys!

38:28.835 --> 38:30.687
You didn't hear me on radio?

38:30.688 --> 38:32.405
No, I didn't hear shit.
You didn't hear me?

38:32.406 --> 38:33.506
<i>No!</i>

38:33.560 --> 38:36.230
<i>Because this is why you don't
lock the door, Lance, by the way.</i>

38:36.329 --> 38:37.385
<i>Lance!</i>

38:37.631 --> 38:40.077
<i>Case and point why you
don't lock the fucking door?</i>

38:40.141 --> 38:42.725
<i>Holy shit!</i>

38:42.728 --> 38:44.764
<i>What did you see?
Which one is it?</i>

38:44.767 --> 38:47.529
<i>- That... fuck the hair.
- Oh yeah it is.</i>

38:47.530 --> 38:49.568
<i>That is fuck!</i>

38:49.717 --> 38:52.480
<i>Alright, I'm just gonna... I'm gonna
dump this quick on the computer.</i>

38:52.481 --> 38:54.208
<i>No no no, Matt, we don't
have time for that.</i>

38:54.284 --> 38:56.946
<i>Grab all the static cams.
Get it all together. You know...</i>

38:56.947 --> 39:00.210
<i>Guys, let's all get up and
start packing this stuff up.</i>

39:00.211 --> 39:01.735
<i>Get it ready for
when Kenny comes.</i>

39:01.736 --> 39:04.335
<i>- Can somebody help me, please?
- No no no no.</i>

39:04.341 --> 39:06.794
<i>I need everybody down
here, Matt. I'm sorry man.</i>

39:06.795 --> 39:08.319
<i>It's gonna cut it's side, I know.</i>

39:08.810 --> 39:11.194
<i>- You got your radio?
- Yeah, I got it right here.</i>

39:11.238 --> 39:14.160
<i>- Sure it works?
- Hope so.</i>

39:14.195 --> 39:17.302
<i> - Did you hear that?
- Yeah, we got it.</i>

39:17.384 --> 39:19.751
<i> - Okay, I'll Be right back, okay?
- Alright man.</i>

39:20.111 --> 39:22.399
<i> Don't fucking leave without me.</i>

39:32.364 --> 39:35.034
Okay, it's time to get
the fuck out of here.

40:09.159 --> 40:10.820
Hey Lance, are you there, man?

40:15.683 --> 40:18.146
Hey guys, I got something up here.

40:19.508 --> 40:21.337
Hello!

40:24.935 --> 40:26.215
Hey Lance!

40:27.461 --> 40:28.790
Hello!

40:30.585 --> 40:32.511
Guys, quit fucking around!

40:50.517 --> 40:53.272
<i>It is now approaching morning.</i>

40:53.307 --> 40:55.998
<i>We haven't seen any
activity in well over an hour.</i>

40:56.033 --> 40:59.547
For Grave Encounters,
I'm Lance Preston.

40:59.895 --> 41:01.900
- One more time...?
- No, we don't have...

41:01.901 --> 41:03.022
One more time.

41:03.645 --> 41:07.811
For Grave Encounters,
I'm Lance Preston.

41:08.871 --> 41:11.470
That's all I got.
Fucking, I why I hate this anyhow...

41:11.495 --> 41:13.411
It doesn't really matter, guys.
You know why?

41:13.412 --> 41:17.013
We can always pick this up tomorrow,
there'll be sunlight, we'd be better too.

41:17.014 --> 41:18.293
- Fine.
- You know what I mean?

41:18.328 --> 41:19.871
That’s good idea.
Where is Matt, anyway?

41:19.906 --> 41:21.587
What the fuck is taking him so long?

41:21.815 --> 41:22.711
Matt?

41:25.241 --> 41:27.421
Matt?
Are you there?

41:28.968 --> 41:30.982
<i>- Lance! Lance!
- Matt?</i>

41:30.983 --> 41:33.008
<i>Radio's not working before.</i>

41:36.701 --> 41:42.694
<i>Guys, I know this
sounds really stupid but...</i>

41:42.729 --> 41:45.900
<i>I'm the last person who wants to go
walking through these halls again.</i>

41:45.903 --> 41:50.031
<i>But it's pitch black, and Matt could
have fallen and hurt himself for real.</i>

41:50.366 --> 41:52.303
<i>She's right, he could be hurt.</i>

41:54.937 --> 41:57.807
<i>- Guys, we have to go look for him.
- Okay...</i>

41:57.842 --> 42:02.400
<i>Alright, this is ridiculous, alright.
Let's go fucking look for him</i>

42:02.435 --> 42:05.102
<i>TC grab the camera.
Sasha grab the camera.</i>

42:05.103 --> 42:05.914
<i>For what?</i>

42:05.915 --> 42:09.739
<i>Listen!  If we gonna go and do this,
then we might as well film everything.</i>

42:12.130 --> 42:14.004
<i> - Thanks for your help, man.
- Hey!</i>

42:14.039 --> 42:16.441
It's no fun hanging around
here I can tell you...!

42:16.878 --> 42:20.768
By myself..!
Jesus Christ.

42:21.496 --> 42:22.882
Matt!

42:23.748 --> 42:26.881
- Matt!
- Matt!

42:27.082 --> 42:29.541
Matt...!

42:30.490 --> 42:32.479
- Matt!
- Matt!

42:32.906 --> 42:35.717
- Matt, where are you, man?
- Where the fuck are you?

42:36.737 --> 42:37.941
Matt!

42:39.832 --> 42:43.262
- What the fuck?
- Shit.

42:44.162 --> 42:46.902
Matt!
Hey Matt!

42:47.037 --> 42:49.408
Why is this shit
everywhere?

42:49.680 --> 42:50.719
Matt!

42:51.395 --> 42:52.108
Matt!

42:52.407 --> 42:53.356
Matt!

42:53.357 --> 42:55.752
- Matt!
- Matt!

42:58.040 --> 42:59.690
Alright, alright, alright.

42:59.725 --> 43:00.941
He wouldn't just leave
equipment like this?

43:00.942 --> 43:01.825
No, he wouldn't

43:01.826 --> 43:03.676
It looks like he was just
packing it up anyway.

43:03.677 --> 43:05.786
He's got to be... He's got to be
down one of this ways.

43:05.789 --> 43:08.676
TC, you go that way,
Sasha and I'll go this way

43:08.717 --> 43:11.008
Why will we do this?
That is a terrible idea.

43:11.146 --> 43:12.912
He's got to be here,
he wouldn't just leave

43:12.913 --> 43:14.067
- his stuff here alright...
- Why don't we split up as a ...?

43:14.068 --> 43:17.340
Sasha comes with me.
TC just check that way, okay?

43:20.832 --> 43:23.167
This looks like the living room
after a fight with my girl!

43:23.222 --> 43:27.263
Matt, where are you man?
I want to go home, this is enough!

43:27.947 --> 43:29.451
Freaking us out! Man.

43:29.852 --> 43:32.079
Look for the cigarette butts...!

43:34.500 --> 43:36.364
Come on, Matt!

43:36.928 --> 43:38.941
This is stupid.. Dude!

43:45.857 --> 43:48.000
I don't understand this guy.

43:57.786 --> 43:59.479
Matt!
Come on, dude!

43:59.815 --> 44:01.920
You're gonna get me
a shit with my girl!

44:02.255 --> 44:06.332
It's late!
Fuck man.

44:06.665 --> 44:08.589
You better be dead or dying, bro.

44:09.193 --> 44:15.264
Matt!  I ain't playing with you
right now!  Where the fuck you at?

44:15.699 --> 44:17.612
What the?!

44:18.378 --> 44:19.542
Matt?

44:34.752 --> 44:37.830
Lance!  Sasha!

44:37.865 --> 44:39.815
- Shit!
- What happened, what happened?

44:40.605 --> 44:42.862
- Don't, don't
- What, what?

44:44.232 --> 44:46.558
Are you serious man?
Are you okay?

44:46.593 --> 44:48.058
- What?
- Just lift me

44:48.083 --> 44:49.582
Lift me.

44:53.996 --> 44:55.801
- I swear to God, someone ...
- What?

44:56.236 --> 44:58.067
- I got pushed..
- What?

44:58.068 --> 45:00.896
Something fucking pushed me, man.
I was looking for fucking Matt.

45:00.931 --> 45:03.213
I was looking downstairs,
sort of fucking

45:03.214 --> 45:05.594
pushed me, I almost
broke my fucking neck, dude.

45:06.289 --> 45:07.766
I looked back and
there was nothing there.

45:07.801 --> 45:10.791
These things have been messing
with us, alright, all night.

45:10.792 --> 45:12.340
We're getting fucking by them.

45:12.375 --> 45:15.534
- Call him! Call Kenny! The only way...
- Okay! Okay!

45:15.593 --> 45:18.021
- Told you. Just call him.
- Jesus, I'm calling Kenny alright?

45:18.822 --> 45:21.011
Jesus Christ.
Fucking signal.

45:21.046 --> 45:22.946
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm not okay!

45:24.747 --> 45:26.999
Fucking piece of shit.

45:28.900 --> 45:30.881
Alright, I can't get a signal.

45:31.059 --> 45:32.144
Oh God...!

45:32.145 --> 45:34.404
- Let me try.
- Alright, check the phones, guys.

45:38.744 --> 45:41.659
Perfect.
Fucking perfect.

45:46.382 --> 45:47.900
What the hell are you doing TC?

45:47.906 --> 45:50.489
What does it look like I'm doing?
Come here and fucking help me.

45:50.724 --> 45:53.451
- You can't break down the door, TC!
- Just watch!

45:53.462 --> 45:55.758
No!  We're gonna cause
damage to the property.

45:55.759 --> 45:57.324
We're going to
be liable for it, alright.

45:57.325 --> 45:59.684
Just be patient.  Wait!
The guys fucking coming.

45:59.985 --> 46:02.672
See hey!  Come on man!
What the fuck!

46:02.673 --> 46:04.190
That's coming out of your rate.

46:04.191 --> 46:06.838
Does it look like I give a fuck
about the fucking rate.

46:06.839 --> 46:08.254
The fuck can...

46:08.259 --> 46:10.301
I'm tired of this shit.
I want to go home

46:10.302 --> 46:12.818
I want to go back to the fucking
hotel and get some fucking sleep.

46:13.219 --> 46:16.068
Hey, you know what?
Your boy is a no show, okay.

46:16.069 --> 46:17.090
What is he?
An hour late?

46:17.095 --> 46:20.261
So just put the fucking camera...

46:20.262 --> 46:21.844
- Christ!
- Fine. Alright.

46:23.346 --> 46:25.737
- Help me.
- Alright, hang on.

46:29.422 --> 46:34.166
<i>- Do you want my help?
- No, Houston, we're fine with you there.</i>

46:37.205 --> 46:42.365
On three okay?
One, two, three...

46:50.185 --> 46:54.305
One, two, three!

47:00.319 --> 47:01.485
What the hell.

47:03.838 --> 47:08.344
No, this is the fucking lobby!
This is the fucking lobby.

47:10.993 --> 47:13.159
- We came in this way, right?
- Hell, yeah!

47:13.194 --> 47:15.383
Yeah, this is the...
this is the lobby, yeah.

47:15.544 --> 47:17.426
This can't be right.

47:17.461 --> 47:19.027
This is impossible.

47:19.062 --> 47:21.930
- This is the way we... this is
where we put our shit, right?
- Yeah.

47:21.934 --> 47:24.220
This is the way we... this is
how we brought the stuff in.

47:24.229 --> 47:28.369
- This doesn't make sense right?
- I don't understand, shit...

47:29.699 --> 47:32.840
This doesn't make any sense...
This is the way we came in.

47:33.128 --> 47:35.621
If there's another hallway,
it doesn't... I don't know ...

47:35.652 --> 47:37.158
It must have got turned around here.

47:37.159 --> 47:40.158
It must be on the other side
of the building or something.

47:41.180 --> 47:42.728
Lance!

47:49.208 --> 47:50.375
Lance!

47:52.737 --> 47:54.857
Are those are same doors?

47:57.361 --> 47:59.286
I'm getting sick of this, guys.

48:00.121 --> 48:02.516
Oh, ho ho ho, yes!

48:03.251 --> 48:05.018
Houston, take that.
Take that, please.

48:07.642 --> 48:09.956
Hey, hey, watch your leg, man.
Watch your leg!

48:09.957 --> 48:12.457
Give me your fucking hand, you
sit and watch.  Isn't that fucking...

48:12.492 --> 48:14.120
All right, all right, all right.

48:14.124 --> 48:15.299
What the fuck is wrong with you?

48:16.148 --> 48:18.425
One, two, three!

48:32.900 --> 48:35.991
What is that fucking same...?
What the fuck is going on?

48:36.026 --> 48:39.050
Maybe it's just an exit down to...
like this way to the emergency exit.

48:39.053 --> 48:40.275
Houston shut the fuck up.

48:40.310 --> 48:41.896
Shut the fuck up.

48:42.303 --> 48:43.813
This, you see?

48:43.931 --> 48:45.603
Now we'll get out.

48:52.510 --> 48:53.693
Give me a fucking second?

48:55.836 --> 48:58.147
- Oh fuck!
- Hey, watch it. Watch yourself.

48:58.148 --> 49:00.659
- We're fucking trapped in here, man!
- No, we're not.

49:00.694 --> 49:03.328
Hey, let's get a tool.
We can try pry the bars out.

49:03.363 --> 49:06.381
I, oh, I got a fucking tool-belt.
Oh, shit, I forgot.

49:06.382 --> 49:09.210
- It's in the van. Outside!
- Oh, fuck!

49:09.215 --> 49:11.315
- You know, how we're locked out?
- We got nothing?

49:11.316 --> 49:13.072
Fucking brilliant idea.

49:13.368 --> 49:16.368
Alright, obviously not all the fucking
windows have bars on them.

49:16.369 --> 49:17.091
Yeah, they do.

49:17.092 --> 49:21.701
No, no!  The one upstairs!  That
one didn’t have any bars on it!  Right?

49:21.736 --> 49:22.619
We just got to find it.

49:22.620 --> 49:24.826
Who knows?
The shit's off...

49:24.875 --> 49:28.227
- Come on.
- What time is it, Sasha?

49:28.500 --> 49:30.533
- 8:34
- You got to be fucking kidding.

49:30.534 --> 49:33.906
- Fuck!
- I told you that fucking ...begin at 8:34.

49:34.041 --> 49:36.252
I have an audition tomorrow!

49:36.287 --> 49:40.710
No one cares about you and your career
inside ... the baggage studio shit!

49:40.711 --> 49:43.586
- Oh! My work's not as important as yours?
- Guys, let me think for a second!

49:43.621 --> 49:45.260
This doesn’t make any
sense, it's fucked up!

49:45.295 --> 49:47.841
I checked the
sunrise times last night.

49:47.984 --> 49:49.729
What's your fucking point?

49:52.309 --> 49:54.487
Should've been bright by 7:45.

49:55.833 --> 49:58.097
But it's still night out.

50:00.263 --> 50:03.695
- The sun is still not up ...
- Didn't make any sense!

50:03.730 --> 50:05.210
It's not fucking funny man..!

50:05.215 --> 50:06.013
Shut up!

50:06.038 --> 50:07.294
This no make no sense.

50:07.329 --> 50:13.329
- I need to get out of this building! Please!
- Somebody help us!

50:14.288 --> 50:18.424
Ok ok ok ok.  Here. Listen, listen.  Well,
let's just try to be rational here, ok?

50:18.425 --> 50:20.406
This is an old building, right?

50:20.421 --> 50:23.420
It's an old building, so it has all
sorts of energy fields, things

50:23.422 --> 50:25.638
and stuff going on, either
could be electrical anomaly,

50:25.639 --> 50:29.150
that has actually moved our clock
faster, something so that you know,

50:29.152 --> 50:34.155
it's actually not really 8.30 but only 6.30.
That would explain why it's so dark out.

50:34.190 --> 50:36.000
And why why... you know,
Kenny hasn't shown up.

50:36.002 --> 50:38.864
- Electric anomaly?
- It's fucking retarded!

50:38.899 --> 50:41.867
Why did you come to believe your fucking
come from idea comes from rational?

50:41.902 --> 50:44.320
This isn't one of your fucking audition
for some science fiction movie!

50:44.322 --> 50:46.384
Because nothing else
is rational here okay.

50:46.385 --> 50:48.944
It is rational as anything else.

51:14.418 --> 51:16.039
I checked my cell phone...

51:16.646 --> 51:20.624
And... it says the time is 1.12.

51:22.069 --> 51:24.902
It's 1:12 pm.

51:27.798 --> 51:32.542
I don’t think that's right.
But I guess it cant be... right?

51:33.428 --> 51:37.426
I don't know.
Everyone's very tired.

51:37.431 --> 51:40.982
So they are just taking a
nap and taking a break.

51:42.755 --> 51:45.082
And we're going to just
wait until Kenny shows up.

51:46.479 --> 51:48.929
I don't know what
the hell is giving me this.

51:50.207 --> 51:52.132
Doesn't makes any sense.

51:55.234 --> 51:57.422
I haven't slept for like 20 hours.

51:59.465 --> 52:05.846
I'm gonna... I'm just gonna set my
alarm for an hour and I'll take a nap.

52:39.725 --> 52:41.463
Houston, what's your problem?

52:41.498 --> 52:44.518
- It's not my problem!
- What the hell are you doing?

52:47.382 --> 52:50.566
- What the hell happened?
- Oh my God!

52:52.708 --> 52:55.991
Someone or something
just broke our lights.

52:56.637 --> 52:59.737
We are in the pitch dark.
All we have is our

52:59.738 --> 53:01.698
flash lights and our camera lights.

53:01.699 --> 53:05.468
- Which you're wasting right now.
- I just checked my cell phone.

53:05.493 --> 53:07.139
And it says it's 8 pm.

53:07.315 --> 53:10.143
So, we slept for 7 hours.

53:10.178 --> 53:14.877
TC went to get a sandwich
and you gotta see this.

53:20.796 --> 53:23.216
Lance!  It stinks...
Close that shit.

53:24.322 --> 53:27.386
What are you...?
Close the fucking thing.. man!

53:30.047 --> 53:34.394
All our food is like that, but
we still have lots of bottled water so...

53:34.429 --> 53:37.156
I don't know, we should be okay.

53:39.101 --> 53:41.082
Why don't we try going
down through the tunnels?

53:41.230 --> 53:44.429
Kenny said that the tunnels
connect all the buildings together,

53:44.454 --> 53:46.782
then maybe we can find a way out
through one of the other buildings.

53:46.783 --> 53:48.505
Are you looking and see
the Great Wall of China?

53:48.506 --> 53:52.157
I'm not going from the goddamn tunnels.
If our lights go out we're fucked.

53:52.433 --> 53:55.332
Eh listen. Remember when you told
me to do the time lapse outside.

53:55.333 --> 53:57.903
- Mm hm.
- I saw a fire escape.

53:57.904 --> 54:01.166
If we get on the roof, probably
climb down and get the fuck out.

54:01.189 --> 54:03.267
Well.  What's the verdict?
Shall we stay in here or ...

54:03.302 --> 54:05.810
I don't care what we do.
Let's just get the fuck out of here!

54:05.812 --> 54:07.064
I really... I don't want
to be here anymore.

54:07.065 --> 54:10.540
- Ok ok.  So everybody, we're gonna
do this.  Everybody wants to do all this?

54:10.541 --> 54:12.366
- To the roof!
- Alright, fine!

54:12.367 --> 54:14.876
Let's pack up all
the gear and let's go.

54:17.196 --> 54:19.862
- Give me some of the light, guys. Come on.
- Here here here.  Sorry.

54:25.033 --> 54:26.502
- We go there?
- Let's wait!

54:26.537 --> 54:28.467
- Lance?
- No, no, no!

54:28.475 --> 54:30.368
TC you knew where we
were going, you said.

54:30.403 --> 54:32.788
I didn't say anything!
Don't put it on me.

54:32.823 --> 54:35.167
No, you said you know
where the ladder was.

54:35.168 --> 54:36.784
No, I said there was a ladder.

54:36.785 --> 54:38.203
- I didn't tell you where.
- Okay. But is it this end?

54:38.232 --> 54:39.816
It doesn't matter.
Was it here?

54:39.980 --> 54:43.613
- I saw from the outside.
- Okay. Got just a ...?

54:44.680 --> 54:46.242
I can't do this, guys!

54:48.407 --> 54:50.204
- Look!
- What the fuck is that?

54:50.734 --> 54:54.038
- Hello! Someone up here?
- We just keep on...

54:54.073 --> 54:55.629
TC!  Is this there?

54:55.664 --> 54:58.270
Don't ask me questions.
Is it staircase or not?

55:00.138 --> 55:02.857
Hey listen, just keep the
light on in front of me.

55:02.892 --> 55:04.201
Move, move move!

55:04.664 --> 55:07.497
Get the fuck out of my way!
Get the fuck out of my way!

55:08.592 --> 55:10.716
- Wait guys!
- Slow Down.

55:10.717 --> 55:11.846
What the fuck, you guys?

55:14.963 --> 55:19.190
Yes, yes.
The fuck, yeah!

55:24.169 --> 55:25.756
No fucking way!

55:25.757 --> 55:28.685
Check this, check this!
That can't be right.

55:33.627 --> 55:35.249
It's fucking solid.

55:35.452 --> 55:38.764
Does it look new?  Does it look
like it's been there for a while?

55:38.899 --> 55:40.682
This doesn't make any sense.

55:44.114 --> 55:47.045
Would you get the fucking
camera out of my face!

55:50.913 --> 55:54.966
- What do you think?
- I don't know, I don't know.

56:06.090 --> 56:11.915
We just left the stair well that was
completely sealed off at the top!

56:11.918 --> 56:14.500
I going to document everything,
when we get out of this.

56:14.935 --> 56:16.806
People are coming to see this.

56:19.945 --> 56:23.194
Look at this!  Okay we came up
4 floors from the stairs, right?

56:23.229 --> 56:24.352
That puts us on the 4th floor.

56:24.387 --> 56:28.389
We came from this way, and
we've gotta at least be here, right?

56:29.025 --> 56:30.823
- Are you sure?
- I don't know ...

56:30.849 --> 56:32.540
- TC, you said one of this floors...
- Lance! Lance! Lance!

56:32.575 --> 56:33.499
What, what?

56:33.500 --> 56:37.203
- What are these?  You were here?
- No, we know we went up a number of stairs!

56:37.204 --> 56:38.404
This has not changed.
This is not opened.

56:38.405 --> 56:39.313
This is not the change.

56:39.327 --> 56:41.632
This says we're on the 1st floor.

56:41.653 --> 56:43.054
Another we keep in mind though.

56:43.055 --> 56:46.667
- Initially this is where we came in, right?
- I know, I know, but...

56:46.983 --> 56:53.367
- TC, are you filming this?
- Yeah, yes, that's fucked up.

56:56.758 --> 56:59.995
What what what?  What the
fuck is that?  Did you hear that?

57:00.230 --> 57:02.369
- Did you guys hear that?
- Oh shit!  What is that?

57:02.414 --> 57:05.854
- Shit! Stop.
- Matt? Matt?

57:06.438 --> 57:10.020
Holy shit!  Over here.
From this foot.  Over here.

57:11.921 --> 57:15.341
Matt! Matt! Matt!

57:15.376 --> 57:16.440
Matt, is that you?

57:23.323 --> 57:26.289
He's not in here.
He's not in here!

57:26.349 --> 57:28.749
Whoa whoa whoa!
That just fucking move?!

57:32.873 --> 57:35.790
Let's get out of here!

58:05.542 --> 58:08.414
Now we wandered the building
to take a look for another stairwell.

58:09.240 --> 58:12.616
And... I don't know.
We couldn't find one.

58:12.668 --> 58:14.462
This building is a fucking maze!

58:15.294 --> 58:17.694
It's like TC said it's...

58:17.695 --> 58:19.682
It's likes just keeps
changing all around us.

58:23.020 --> 58:24.858
We still haven't been
able to find Matt.

58:25.948 --> 58:27.904
I don't know if he's okay.

58:28.905 --> 58:31.170
At least he's not seeing
that same shit as we are!

58:37.504 --> 58:42.324
We are all tired, and we are hungry.
So we gonna try to sleep again.

58:44.629 --> 58:46.875
We're going to
sleep in shifts this time

58:47.056 --> 58:50.054
so somebody can always be at watch.

58:55.886 --> 58:57.897
- TC, you're rolling now?
- Yeah.

59:00.411 --> 59:02.693
We just woke up and
you guys got to see this!

59:03.338 --> 59:04.740
Turn the fucking camera off!

59:04.775 --> 59:06.585
Sasha!  Come on.
We gotta to document this okay.

59:06.587 --> 59:07.710
- I'm sorry. People got to see this.
- No, no!

59:07.712 --> 59:09.547
- Careful! Careful!
- I'm so sorry.

59:10.943 --> 59:14.428
Sasha, we got to tape this down.
This is unheard of.

59:14.463 --> 59:16.116
There is no way someone came in here

59:16.117 --> 59:18.051
and did that without us noticing.

59:18.086 --> 59:20.705
- Dude cut it!  Cut this.
- My pleasure.

59:20.740 --> 59:21.746
Matt!

59:24.646 --> 59:26.038
I swear I heard.

59:26.473 --> 59:27.776
Matt!

59:29.297 --> 59:30.202
<i>Hello!</i>

59:30.558 --> 59:31.437
Matt?

59:31.472 --> 59:35.024
See?  There, there. Fucking
heard him, I told you guys.

59:35.025 --> 59:36.045
He's alive!

59:36.051 --> 59:37.517
Matt! Are you okay?

59:38.215 --> 59:39.859
Can you hear me?

59:41.703 --> 59:43.098
<i>I'm freezing!</i>

59:51.131 --> 59:53.069
Just tell us where you are.
We'll come and get you..

59:54.868 --> 59:57.145
Matt!
Shit!

59:57.361 --> 59:58.883
He's not there anymore.

59:59.408 --> 01:00:00.939
<i>We have to find him.</i>

01:00:01.036 --> 01:00:01.835
<i>How do we gonna find him?</i>

01:00:01.836 --> 01:00:03.596
<i>We can't even find
our way to the front door!</i>

01:00:03.762 --> 01:00:06.848
<i>Houston, he can't be far.
Those walkie-talkies are a piece of shit.</i>

01:00:09.189 --> 01:00:11.174
Listen, how do we even know its him?

01:00:14.299 --> 01:00:18.656
Matt!
Are you in here?

01:00:19.445 --> 01:00:21.847
- Sorry, sorry, sorry!
- Fuck!

01:00:22.770 --> 01:00:25.176
Matt!  We hear you buddy!
Where are you?

01:00:27.794 --> 01:00:29.579
Sasha, try all the frequencies.

01:00:29.795 --> 01:00:31.678
It doesn't have that much range.

01:00:32.723 --> 01:00:34.405
How far is did you say
you thought it was?

01:00:34.427 --> 01:00:35.923
I don't know how far,
the specifications...

01:00:36.049 --> 01:00:41.399
- So what did you guess? 200-300-400?
- 200 yards to get a clear signal.

01:00:41.578 --> 01:00:45.030
Maybe 300... before it
starts crapping out.  Okay.

01:00:45.033 --> 01:00:46.598
<i>Stay together, come on.</i>

01:00:46.954 --> 01:00:49.053
<i>That's a dead end!
Dead end.</i>

01:00:49.724 --> 01:00:51.628
<i>- Matt!
- Hey Matt!</i>

01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:56.590
<i>- Matt.
- Matt!</i>

01:00:57.688 --> 01:00:59.986
<i>Where the fuck are you?</i>

01:01:09.318 --> 01:01:11.707
Listen guys.  This is
fucking pointless, alright?

01:01:11.742 --> 01:01:14.519
If we were to find it, he would...
the range of it no matter what...

01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:15.986
<i>Holy shit!</i>

01:01:16.295 --> 01:01:18.741
<i>- What was that?
- That was Matt!</i>

01:01:21.033 --> 01:01:22.323
<i>What are you doing, man?</i>

01:01:26.348 --> 01:01:28.297
<I>What the fuck... ?

01:01:31.895 --> 01:01:34.932
Lance! Lance! Lance...

01:01:43.029 --> 01:01:44.731
<i>Do fucking something!</i>

01:01:46.256 --> 01:01:47.451
<i>Lance! Lance!</i>

01:01:47.852 --> 01:01:50.875
<i>Hey you.
Hey!</i>

01:01:51.783 --> 01:01:54.346
<i>Who are you?
How did you get in here?</i>

01:02:11.513 --> 01:02:14.049
Turn off the light!
Light off!

01:02:17.341 --> 01:02:18.613
<i>Did you see her fucking face?</i>

01:02:18.648 --> 01:02:19.548
<i>Shut your fucking mouth!</i>

01:02:19.583 --> 01:02:20.980
<i>Did you see her fucking face?</i>

01:02:28.121 --> 01:02:30.762
<i>What's happening here?
What is it wrong with me?</i>

01:02:30.763 --> 01:02:32.063
<i>Oh my God!</i>

01:02:35.347 --> 01:02:37.842
<i>Oh shit! Oh shit!</i>

01:02:37.975 --> 01:02:42.664
<i>Shit, we lost him!
Oh shit, we fucking lost Houston!</i>

01:02:44.100 --> 01:02:46.602
<i>Matt!</i>

01:02:53.032 --> 01:02:54.133
<i>Guys!</i>

01:02:55.058 --> 01:02:56.358
<i>Guys!</i>

01:02:59.581 --> 01:03:01.072
<i>Sasha!</i>

01:03:11.618 --> 01:03:12.414
TC!

01:03:15.545 --> 01:03:16.451
Lance!

01:03:54.184 --> 01:03:55.893
Is there anybody here?

01:03:58.048 --> 01:03:59.304
TC!

01:04:08.541 --> 01:04:10.672
Help! Help!

01:04:23.317 --> 01:04:25.744
Help! Please!

01:04:55.981 --> 01:04:57.796
Houston's gone.

01:04:59.207 --> 01:05:03.445
then we tried Matt on
radio but he doesn't respond.

01:05:05.335 --> 01:05:06.507
What the fuck is that?

01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:10.844
We keep hearing crazy shit
like that all around us.

01:05:12.163 --> 01:05:13.128
Fuck!

01:05:14.592 --> 01:05:16.481
I don't think how
long it's going to last.

01:05:21.122 --> 01:05:22.858
We are not alone in here anymore.

01:05:28.799 --> 01:05:31.247
How is the name on it?

01:05:31.273 --> 01:05:34.034
How the fuck is my
fucking name on it?

01:05:35.802 --> 01:05:40.882
First, I get scratches on
my back and now ...

01:05:41.228 --> 01:05:43.050
What the fuck!

01:05:43.055 --> 01:05:45.894
When we woke up, we had this
you got to see this ...

01:05:45.895 --> 01:05:51.768
Fuck you. What the fuck, what the fucking
wrong with me, you fucking asshole?

01:05:51.803 --> 01:05:55.499
- I didn't fucking mean to, okay?
- You fucking...!

01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:59.472
- I didn't fucking mean to.
- You bring us up, you asshole.

01:05:59.484 --> 01:06:01.773
What the fuck does this mean?
It means we're fucked.

01:06:01.813 --> 01:06:03.438
Okay! That's what it fucking means

01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:05.390
This is insane.

01:06:06.558 --> 01:06:07.859
Fucking insane!

01:06:30.797 --> 01:06:33.804
- Don't look in it!
- Why, what wrong with looking like this?

01:06:38.827 --> 01:06:41.721
What the fuck?
Enough, man!

01:06:43.655 --> 01:06:46.310
There's something over there.

01:06:51.896 --> 01:06:53.305
Here!  Enough is enough!

01:06:53.307 --> 01:06:56.095
We keep walking in what
feels like circles and

01:06:57.922 --> 01:07:02.802
we... we still can't find
Matt and Houston.

01:07:02.862 --> 01:07:05.866
- Will you stop!
- Will you stop what?

01:07:05.887 --> 01:07:09.213
Are you kidding me?
Fucking whole shit, we're not making 'em!

01:07:09.214 --> 01:07:12.303
- Fucking TV show.
- I'm just documenting stuff, okay?

01:07:12.338 --> 01:07:13.502
People will gonna want to see this!

01:07:13.537 --> 01:07:18.390
Matt and Houston are gone?
We need to concentrate on

01:07:18.393 --> 01:07:20.694
getting out of here and
finding them.

01:07:21.118 --> 01:07:24.531
And you're just still
doing this whole shit!

01:07:24.642 --> 01:07:26.170
Okay you guys, just
stay together, okay?

01:07:26.171 --> 01:07:27.956
- I'm just really...
- Don't worry about it.

01:07:37.227 --> 01:07:39.932
- Is that the fastest you have to run?
- Let's go!

01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:43.860
Jesus Christ! Come on!
Keep up!

01:07:43.865 --> 01:07:45.400
No, no, no, no! Get up!

01:07:45.402 --> 01:07:47.229
Are you out of your fucking mind?

01:07:47.230 --> 01:07:50.069
- Get up! Get up!
- Come on!

01:07:52.158 --> 01:07:54.294
- I can't, I can't!
- Yes, you can.

01:07:54.382 --> 01:07:57.500
Come on, you've got to get up.
You got to get up.

01:07:57.610 --> 01:08:01.946
Come on.  I know!  I know!  You got
to be strong. You got to listen, ok?

01:08:01.981 --> 01:08:04.512
You got to get up.
We got to keep going!

01:08:06.266 --> 01:08:08.510
What, what?

01:08:08.689 --> 01:08:10.001
<i>Just get over here!</i>

01:08:11.016 --> 01:08:12.798
What are you waiting for?
Come in!

01:08:13.641 --> 01:08:14.567
Look!

01:08:16.466 --> 01:08:19.531
Oh shit!  Is it Matt?
That's him, right?

01:08:19.532 --> 01:08:22.108
<i>I don't know, man.
Matt!  Hey!</i>

01:08:23.294 --> 01:08:24.814
<i>Matt, get up!</i>

01:08:24.814 --> 01:08:27.484
<i>Matt, Matt!</i>

01:08:27.523 --> 01:08:29.073
<i>Just shut the fucking room!</i>

01:08:32.022 --> 01:08:33.327
<i>Hey Matt?</i>

01:08:38.850 --> 01:08:41.649
- Hey hey hey. Stop fucking around!
- Matt, are you okay?

01:08:44.705 --> 01:08:49.243
The patient exhibits acute...
disorder linked to childhood phobia.

01:08:50.732 --> 01:08:51.676
Jesus Christ!

01:08:54.859 --> 01:08:57.564
- Get him the fuck up!
- Let's go! Go!

01:08:57.683 --> 01:09:01.995
Come on, get him up!  Pull him over and
let's get the fuck out of this room now.

01:09:03.036 --> 01:09:06.812
<i>Get him in here.
Come on.</i>

01:09:07.871 --> 01:09:11.090
<i>Put him down on bed,
put him down there.</i>

01:09:11.412 --> 01:09:13.518
<i>- You see anything?
- No, its good.</i>

01:09:15.441 --> 01:09:19.348
Hey! Where you been?
Where did you get those clothes?

01:09:20.466 --> 01:09:23.640
- Well, for God's sake, talk to us!
- You guys, look at his wrist.

01:09:24.997 --> 01:09:26.296
Matt? Matt?

01:09:29.925 --> 01:09:32.703
Where did you get this?
Where did you get all this shit?

01:09:32.827 --> 01:09:38.720
Matt!  What did they do to you?
What did you see?

01:09:39.875 --> 01:09:42.612
Nothing is bullshit!
Look, where have you been?

01:09:42.613 --> 01:09:45.500
You probably know a way out of here.
You got to know a way out of here.

01:09:46.604 --> 01:09:50.518
Of course there's a way out.
We can all leave,

01:09:51.158 --> 01:09:52.569
as soon as we're better.

01:09:52.703 --> 01:09:54.842
What?  What do you mean
"when we're better"?

01:09:55.343 --> 01:09:56.980
What the fuck does that mean?

01:09:56.982 --> 01:09:59.516
Well, I wasn't ready yet.

01:10:01.710 --> 01:10:05.050
Progress is slow.  But the patient
is responding to treatment.

01:10:05.085 --> 01:10:07.860
This guy is out of his mind.  He is
like high or something. He talks of...

01:10:07.865 --> 01:10:11.461
- TC!   Shut up!
- You don't need to tell me fucking, fuck!

01:10:13.490 --> 01:10:17.872
Don't be sad
Everything is gonna be okay.

01:10:22.719 --> 01:10:24.063
He'll help you too.

01:10:32.249 --> 01:10:33.275
<i>Oh my God!</i>

01:10:33.276 --> 01:10:36.684
- Okay TC!  Go check that door!
- I already did.

01:10:37.026 --> 01:10:39.508
Check it!  Not...
if something gets in here man.

01:10:39.509 --> 01:10:41.411
Just make sure
there's nothing in here!

01:10:51.057 --> 01:10:52.431
We found Matt.

01:10:54.582 --> 01:10:56.020
He's all fucked up.

01:11:09.402 --> 01:11:10.800
<i>There's somebody I think is here.</i>

01:11:11.539 --> 01:11:12.708
What?

01:11:13.168 --> 01:11:16.346
- It's okay.
- What are you doing?

01:11:29.999 --> 01:11:31.574
I don't feel good.

01:11:34.219 --> 01:11:36.396
I think there's
something wrong with me.

01:11:43.252 --> 01:11:47.898
Yeah, you feel really warm.
I think you got fever.

01:11:51.181 --> 01:11:53.680
- Here.  Have a sip.
- Thank you.

01:11:53.687 --> 01:11:56.509
- Get some sleep.
- I can't sleep.

01:12:00.575 --> 01:12:02.815
Thank God.
We'll be able to sleep again.

01:12:20.170 --> 01:12:21.845
- Come on!
- Come on.

01:12:21.901 --> 01:12:23.141
Come on...!

01:12:27.398 --> 01:12:30.056
Run!
Run!

01:12:31.372 --> 01:12:33.346
Come on, get in!
Come on now!

01:13:04.001 --> 01:13:07.334
<i>- Did you see anything?
- What is that?</i>

01:13:07.637 --> 01:13:10.517
There's blood in the tub!
There's blood in the tub!

01:13:10.565 --> 01:13:12.310
- What?
- Come on!

01:13:12.311 --> 01:13:16.329
...going far away.
Fuck!

01:13:23.027 --> 01:13:24.826
Matt.  Matt!

01:13:24.868 --> 01:13:27.026
- What he is doing?
- TC!  Get him away from the tub.

01:13:27.095 --> 01:13:29.255
Come on Matt!

01:13:29.290 --> 01:13:31.434
TC!  What the hell is he doing?

01:13:31.447 --> 01:13:32.795
I don't fucking know!

01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:39.497
Oh my God!
Oh my God!

01:13:41.139 --> 01:13:42.536
Help me!
Help me!

01:13:42.683 --> 01:13:43.786
Flip the tub!

01:13:53.627 --> 01:13:56.028
- He is gone!
- He is gone?

01:13:56.808 --> 01:13:59.078
He's fucking gone!

01:13:59.113 --> 01:14:01.135
He just disappeared!

01:15:13.789 --> 01:15:15.812
Oh fuck!
No, no!

01:15:22.020 --> 01:15:23.143
It is an elevator!

01:15:24.186 --> 01:15:25.477
Open it!
Open it!

01:15:26.308 --> 01:15:28.245
Open it!
Open it!

01:15:33.497 --> 01:15:34.901
It's an elevator shaft.

01:15:35.727 --> 01:15:36.975
If we can get down to the tunnels,

01:15:36.976 --> 01:15:38.969
we could use them to get
one of the other buildings.

01:15:46.354 --> 01:15:49.445
Go!
Fuck, fuck!

01:15:50.007 --> 01:15:53.645
Listen! Listen to me.
I believe it's safer in there, okay.

01:15:53.646 --> 01:15:57.996
I'm going to get some... and then
we're getting out of here. Okay?

01:15:58.138 --> 01:16:00.137
Stay here with him, man. Okay?

01:16:39.075 --> 01:16:40.291
What the hell is that?

01:16:43.604 --> 01:16:45.350
Jesus!
Is that a tongue?

01:17:05.438 --> 01:17:07.250
What's wrong?
What's wrong?

01:17:15.364 --> 01:17:17.251
Bring the light, bring it here.

01:17:19.683 --> 01:17:23.578
There is a ladder. We can use it.
We can use the ladder to head down.

01:17:23.649 --> 01:17:24.980
How are we going to get Matt?

01:17:25.048 --> 01:17:27.708
I'm going to reach across, and
then you help me with Matt, okay?

01:17:31.675 --> 01:17:33.786
Get back there!
Stay back.

01:17:34.548 --> 01:17:36.173
Lance! Lance!

01:17:45.227 --> 01:17:46.741
<i>Where the hell is
the night vision button?</i>

01:17:48.354 --> 01:17:49.233
There it is!

01:18:38.302 --> 01:18:39.500
He's gone?

01:18:39.924 --> 01:18:42.253
I don't know, he just disappeared.

01:18:43.053 --> 01:18:46.496
<i>Go on. Go on.
He may come back. Go on.</i>

01:18:49.782 --> 01:18:51.347
- Where the hell is he?
- Matt!

01:18:53.652 --> 01:18:58.110
Jesus!  He jumped!
He jumped!

01:19:28.250 --> 01:19:29.322
Come on!

01:19:29.323 --> 01:19:31.231
Easy.
I got you.

01:19:31.232 --> 01:19:34.827
You're okay.
Go on.

01:19:37.003 --> 01:19:37.905
It's okay.

01:19:53.785 --> 01:19:54.752
It's the tunnels!

01:19:56.809 --> 01:19:59.064
We made it to the tunnels.
Come on.

01:19:59.837 --> 01:20:01.695
I can't.
I can't leave him.

01:20:01.866 --> 01:20:03.489
Come on, Sasha!
Get out of there.

01:20:03.493 --> 01:20:06.582
Remember what Kenny said.
They connect the buildings, right!

01:20:07.219 --> 01:20:08.547
You need to do this with me.

01:20:09.548 --> 01:20:12.401
- I can't do this alone! Okay?
- Okay.

01:20:16.876 --> 01:20:20.137
Stay close to me.
Let's go this way.

01:20:22.208 --> 01:20:23.864
It can't be too far.

01:20:30.539 --> 01:20:32.840
Okay, we can.
Come on...

01:20:38.372 --> 01:20:43.499
No! We should hit a...
We should hit a junction by now.

01:20:44.302 --> 01:20:47.721
It should have been right around here!
What the fuck!

01:20:52.596 --> 01:20:53.700
I can't...

01:20:57.060 --> 01:20:58.299
Wait a second!

01:21:04.014 --> 01:21:05.251
Sash, you okay?

01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:09.027
Oh Jesus!

01:21:22.105 --> 01:21:24.809
I want my mom!

01:21:41.647 --> 01:21:44.958
It's a...
It's day.

01:21:45.374 --> 01:21:47.079
What day is today?

01:21:50.505 --> 01:21:52.277
I don't even know what day it is.

01:21:54.732 --> 01:21:57.204
We spent all day
walking in one direction and...

01:21:57.239 --> 01:21:59.033
we didn't get anywhere.

01:21:59.860 --> 01:22:02.096
I figured counting me in the wrong...

01:22:03.189 --> 01:22:05.637
Sasha not going to make it.

01:22:12.422 --> 01:22:13.507
Who's there?

01:22:15.248 --> 01:22:16.373
Who is that?

01:23:17.825 --> 01:23:19.627
Sasha?

01:23:29.458 --> 01:23:31.488
Sasha, where are you?

01:23:31.583 --> 01:23:33.001
Where are you?

01:23:34.699 --> 01:23:35.786
Sash!

01:23:43.850 --> 01:23:44.961
Sasha!

01:23:55.492 --> 01:23:56.595
Shit!

01:23:58.168 --> 01:23:59.112
Damn it!

01:24:07.664 --> 01:24:09.010
What do you want from me?

01:24:15.474 --> 01:24:16.832
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

01:24:40.239 --> 01:24:42.438
I'm running low on battery power.

01:24:45.592 --> 01:24:47.919
Now, I only turn on light
only when I need to, now.

01:24:50.097 --> 01:24:52.248
But I don't really
need the light anymore!

01:24:55.029 --> 01:24:56.632
I just keep walking straight.

01:24:59.511 --> 01:25:01.656
I could walk in the dark for hours.

01:25:03.745 --> 01:25:05.881
It's kind of like a game.

01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:14.824
How long can you go?

01:25:16.910 --> 01:25:19.216
Anybody watching ...

01:25:20.643 --> 01:25:21.500
Fuck you!

01:25:25.474 --> 01:25:26.941
Fuck you!

01:25:27.701 --> 01:25:29.549
Fuck you, guys!

01:25:31.138 --> 01:25:32.622
This is for you.

01:26:30.641 --> 01:26:34.450
Don't you hear in these walls?
Don't you hear?

01:26:34.483 --> 01:26:38.692
Don't you hear anything?

01:26:42.302 --> 01:26:44.149
Come and get me!

01:26:50.056 --> 01:26:52.173
Just woke up and...

01:26:53.889 --> 01:26:55.881
I don't know how long
I was sleeping but...

01:26:56.121 --> 01:26:57.776
There is a door!

01:26:58.848 --> 01:27:00.394
You have to see it!

01:27:50.478 --> 01:27:51.673
This isn't happening.

01:27:53.490 --> 01:27:54.530
This isn't happening.

01:27:57.515 --> 01:27:59.013
Oh God!

01:29:03.117 --> 01:29:06.428
Jesus! Jesus!
Its...

01:29:33.300 --> 01:29:34.654
It's impossible!

01:29:36.278 --> 01:29:38.328
Shit! Shit!

01:29:49.459 --> 01:29:52.165
No! No!
I'm not crazy!

01:29:52.191 --> 01:29:57.098
I'm not crazy!
No! No! No!

01:30:07.743 --> 01:30:10.183
I'm so much better now!

01:30:12.813 --> 01:30:15.017
I can finally go home!

01:30:18.912 --> 01:30:25.254
For Grave Encounters.
I'm Lance Preston.
