WEBVTT

00:16.082 --> 00:17.584
Whenever you're doing a caramel,

00:17.684 --> 00:20.587
you swirl the pan,
or it will burn,

00:20.687 --> 00:24.424
and then you'll have to
start all over.

00:24.524 --> 00:27.193
And, goodness,
we have run out of time.

00:28.428 --> 00:30.196
Um, I'm afraid...

00:31.498 --> 00:35.902
...that is all
we have time for.

00:36.002 --> 00:41.341
But, trust me,
it is spectacular

00:41.408 --> 00:44.544
and very French.

00:46.379 --> 00:48.415
Bon appétit.

00:48.515 --> 00:49.783
And cut.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.184
That's a cut.

00:53.086 --> 00:55.388
Well, I haven't had
one of those in a while.

00:55.455 --> 00:57.590
What happened?

00:57.690 --> 01:01.127
My mind kept wandering
to my speech for the gala.

01:01.227 --> 01:03.096
Can we do it over?

01:03.196 --> 01:05.698
Especially with that trip
eating up the rest of the week.

01:05.765 --> 01:07.467
Ah, damn it.

01:07.567 --> 01:08.802
And of all the dishes.

01:08.902 --> 01:10.970
Duck à l'Orange
is Paul's favorite.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.539
It's okay.
I'll live.

01:12.605 --> 01:15.775
Yeah, but it looks so festive
at the end, and -- Oh, well.

01:15.875 --> 01:17.310
<i>C'est la vie, ma cherie.</i>

01:17.410 --> 01:19.746
Oh, no, Avis.
I don't deserve cheering up.

01:19.813 --> 01:22.482
I fucked the duck.

01:25.118 --> 01:26.953
Oh, excuse me, sir.

01:27.053 --> 01:29.456
How about these?

01:29.556 --> 01:32.659
You know, this is silly.
I don't know why I even care.

01:32.759 --> 01:34.461
You're all set
with what you're wearing?

01:34.561 --> 01:35.895
Black, I'm assuming.

01:35.962 --> 01:38.731
I have
a few options I'm mulling over.

01:38.798 --> 01:40.733
Still a little shell-shocked
you included me.

01:40.800 --> 01:43.503
Oh, why wouldn't you be
at the WGBH table?

01:43.603 --> 01:45.271
You're part of the show.

01:45.338 --> 01:47.006
New York City.

01:47.107 --> 01:49.008
I do miss her so.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.977
Yes,
it is fun to visit.

01:51.077 --> 01:54.147
But, between us, it was
a terrible place to be a virgin.

01:55.248 --> 01:57.250
Well,
these aren't bad.

01:58.585 --> 01:59.686
Oh.

01:59.786 --> 02:02.489
You know, I did something
a bit reckless.

02:02.589 --> 02:05.692
Mm?

02:05.792 --> 02:07.861
Oh, you didn't.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.496
We haven't spoken
in years,

02:09.596 --> 02:11.764
but we had a lovely chat.

02:11.831 --> 02:13.032
What was
the name again?

02:13.133 --> 02:14.367
Elliot Astor.

02:14.467 --> 02:17.270
Oh, Avis,
how marvelous.

02:17.337 --> 02:20.540
Oh, excuse me,
what about these?

02:20.640 --> 02:21.774
That would be a no.

02:21.841 --> 02:24.144
Well, I have an idea.

02:24.210 --> 02:27.213
Why don't you just bring me
whatever you<i> do</i> have in a 12,

02:27.313 --> 02:28.781
and we'll go from there?

02:30.483 --> 02:33.286
I want to look elegant,
but professional.

02:33.353 --> 02:35.155
Classy.
This is classy, right?

02:35.221 --> 02:38.458
If by classy
you mean sexless.

02:38.525 --> 02:40.793
If it were up to you,
you'd slather me with raw meat

02:40.860 --> 02:42.896
and shove me
into the lion's den.

02:42.996 --> 02:46.065
Sweetheart, you only get
to be young once.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.867
I worry you're not
taking advantage.

02:47.967 --> 02:49.502
Mm.

02:49.569 --> 02:51.070
Let the people see them.

02:51.171 --> 02:52.338
You know, most mothers

02:52.405 --> 02:53.907
would appreciate
their daughter's modesty.

02:54.007 --> 02:56.809
Most mothers are becoming
happy grandmothers by now.

02:56.876 --> 02:58.378
Oh, God,
not this again.

02:58.478 --> 03:00.246
Please, Alice.

03:00.346 --> 03:03.082
Can't you say yes
just this once?

03:03.183 --> 03:04.751
He's a lawyer
from a good family.

03:04.851 --> 03:07.020
And if he looks anything
like his father,

03:07.086 --> 03:09.422
a cup of coffee
won't kill you.

03:11.024 --> 03:14.360
It's a big deal.
The Waldorf Astoria?

03:14.427 --> 03:15.562
Wish I could go.

03:15.662 --> 03:18.831
I'm not excited
about the Waldorf, Mare.

03:18.898 --> 03:21.734
What's the shirt for,
Russ?

03:21.834 --> 03:23.436
Alright, you remember
my old professor,

03:23.536 --> 03:24.871
Richard Leacock?

03:24.938 --> 03:27.173
Well, he's setting me up
with another former student.

03:27.240 --> 03:29.209
She makes documentaries
all over the South.

03:29.275 --> 03:30.610
Mm.

03:30.710 --> 03:32.579
I know. I know.
I know, I know.

03:32.679 --> 03:34.681
We have a baby,
and babies demand things

03:34.747 --> 03:38.284
like food and clothes,
but I have to try, Mare.

03:38.384 --> 03:40.186
I need to work at
something I love,

03:40.253 --> 03:42.355
not just something
I'm good at.

03:42.422 --> 03:44.924
Maybe it's just the fear
of death or something, but...

03:47.594 --> 03:49.295
...I want
to be remembered.

03:49.395 --> 03:52.699
Fondly?
Or just in general?

03:54.701 --> 03:57.870
Bless you.

03:57.937 --> 03:59.939
That's, what,
number four now?

04:00.039 --> 04:01.574
And in the midst
of cuddling.

04:01.641 --> 04:04.210
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
No, don't apologize.

04:04.277 --> 04:05.478
I liked it.

04:05.578 --> 04:06.980
It worked for me.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.482
Ooh.
One more for the repertoire.

04:12.986 --> 04:13.953
Oh.

04:39.078 --> 04:41.314
"But it is my hope
that someday,

04:41.414 --> 04:44.017
despite
its essential nature,

04:44.117 --> 04:48.087
cooking, like architecture,
will be seen by Americans

04:48.154 --> 04:52.992
not just as a practical pursuit,
but as an art."

04:54.694 --> 04:56.362
Is it too much?

04:56.462 --> 04:58.865
But I wonder if you need
to tackle the rebuttal.

04:58.965 --> 05:00.333
The rebuttal?

05:00.433 --> 05:02.869
The ephemeral nature
of the meal.

05:02.969 --> 05:04.537
Versailles endures.

05:04.637 --> 05:06.673
The mousse does not.

05:06.773 --> 05:10.209
Paul.<i> Gesundheit.</i>

05:10.310 --> 05:14.047
I'm offering after-dinner
remarks at the Waldorf.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.115
It's not a lecture
at Harvard Hall.

05:16.182 --> 05:19.052
Fine. Just change "cooking"
to<i> "gastronomie"</i>

05:19.152 --> 05:20.953
and call it a night.

05:21.020 --> 05:22.388
That is a good note.

05:26.059 --> 05:30.997
You usually get hives
before you go to New York.

05:31.064 --> 05:32.532
Is that more of the same,
do you think?

05:32.632 --> 05:34.000
Uh, that's my guess.

05:34.067 --> 05:37.303
One might describe it as an,
um, allergic memory.

05:37.370 --> 05:39.405
My body thinks
I'm dreading the trip.

05:39.505 --> 05:41.841
But my body is wrong,
for once.

05:48.247 --> 05:49.916
Come on,
I'll drive you.

06:08.434 --> 06:10.069
Oh, this is very nice.

06:12.572 --> 06:15.208
I'm dying.

06:15.274 --> 06:16.576
Oh, you've died?

06:16.676 --> 06:17.744
Thank you so much.

06:17.844 --> 06:19.278
Thank you.
If you'll follow me.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.447
I'm good from here.
Thank you.

06:21.547 --> 06:24.283
Oh, darling.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.452
I can't leave you
like this.

06:26.552 --> 06:27.787
Oh, you must.
It's too

06:27.887 --> 06:31.391
impor...
...tant.

06:31.457 --> 06:34.127
But, Paul,
it's just lunch.

06:34.227 --> 06:39.065
Blanche Knopf at Lutèce
is not "just lunch."

06:39.132 --> 06:41.801
Could you get me
a cold compress?

06:41.901 --> 06:44.137
I'll get it.

06:44.237 --> 06:47.540
And my diary.

06:47.607 --> 06:50.643
Oh, eat a lot
of foie gras for me.

06:50.743 --> 06:53.613
Try and remember
the sensation exactly

06:53.713 --> 06:55.047
so you can report back.

06:55.114 --> 06:57.049
Oh, of course, darling.

06:57.116 --> 07:00.319
If something happens
to me...

07:00.420 --> 07:03.790
while you're at lunch,
just remember,

07:03.890 --> 07:08.561
I love you to pieces
and I hold no grudges.

07:09.595 --> 07:11.764
Oh, that's it.
I-I'm not going.

07:11.831 --> 07:13.933
See what you've done,
Paul?

07:14.000 --> 07:14.967
I--

07:15.067 --> 07:17.170
I'll stay.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.604
Nonsense,
you have your date.

07:18.671 --> 07:20.973
It's for the best.
Really.

07:21.073 --> 07:22.241
I'll see if
he can meet tomorrow.

07:22.308 --> 07:25.344
Oh, no, we couldn't.
Tell her, Paul.

07:25.445 --> 07:26.779
Go, go, go, go.

07:26.846 --> 07:29.081
I'm fine.

07:29.148 --> 07:31.150
This is
too important for you.

07:31.250 --> 07:34.353
To be perfectly frank,
the day was already feeling

07:34.454 --> 07:36.622
a little overcrowded
for my liking.

07:36.689 --> 07:38.491
You're an angel.

07:45.631 --> 07:48.601
Let's see if they have
any chicken soup in this dump.

07:52.305 --> 07:56.209
Oh, my goodness.
Foie gras with

07:56.309 --> 08:00.179
dark chocolate sauce
and a bitter orange marmalade.

08:02.215 --> 08:04.050
Is it hot in here
or is it just me?

08:05.785 --> 08:08.354
I had it last week.
It's good if you like
that kind of thing.

08:08.454 --> 08:11.057
Is it as sinful
and insane as it sounds?

08:11.157 --> 08:12.458
It's a little rich.

08:12.525 --> 08:16.295
It evoked a dessert my mother
used to make for seder.

08:18.164 --> 08:20.566
I'm so delighted
to be here.

08:20.666 --> 08:24.237
I just wish Paul
were up to it, but...

08:24.337 --> 08:26.739
Thank you, Blanche,
for the lovely invitation.

08:26.839 --> 08:29.909
The room
is simply magnificent.

08:30.009 --> 08:34.046
Of course I've read about it,
but even before one bite,

08:34.146 --> 08:36.082
it exceeds
all expectations.

08:36.182 --> 08:37.583
Who can see
with this lighting?

08:37.683 --> 08:40.753
And this menu -- Andre's wife,
Simone, writes them,

08:40.853 --> 08:42.355
but her penmanship --

08:42.421 --> 08:43.656
Where are you looking?

08:43.723 --> 08:45.591
Nonsense,
I'm not a child.

08:47.193 --> 08:50.429
Tonight's a very big night
for Julia, Blanche.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.366
Public television's
brightest stars

08:53.432 --> 08:55.001
from all over the country
are coming,

08:55.067 --> 08:56.269
and she's
a guest of honor.

08:56.369 --> 08:57.904
Yes, yes.
I know.

08:58.004 --> 08:59.539
I read the memo.

08:59.605 --> 09:01.340
You know
what's truly amazing?

09:01.407 --> 09:04.577
"The French Chef" has brought
a whole new audience

09:04.677 --> 09:05.778
to "Mastering."

09:05.878 --> 09:08.214
Sales have
more than tripled

09:08.281 --> 09:10.449
since she went
on the airwaves.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.351
I'll have
to check it out.

09:13.886 --> 09:15.121
Oh, you've never
watched it?

09:15.221 --> 09:17.957
Truth is, I hardly watch
any television at all.

09:18.057 --> 09:20.192
Well, I completely
understand.

09:20.259 --> 09:23.629
Paul and I bought our first
television just this past year,

09:23.729 --> 09:25.798
and only because
I've got my own show.

09:25.898 --> 09:28.534
There's something
transient and ephemeral

09:28.601 --> 09:30.870
about television
which makes me leery.

09:30.937 --> 09:33.306
I respectfully disagree,
Blanche.

09:35.908 --> 09:38.644
There's no denying it.
TV is the future.

09:38.744 --> 09:41.881
TV is not the future.

09:41.948 --> 09:43.883
It's fleeting.
Airwaves carry no weight.

09:43.950 --> 09:47.320
They have no heft.
Now, a book in your hands --

09:47.420 --> 09:50.756
Books accumulate
in the minds of the readers

09:50.823 --> 09:51.958
who invest in them.

09:52.058 --> 09:53.326
Gosh, I like that.

09:53.426 --> 09:57.663
Well, books are a legacy --
a legacy to be proud of.

09:59.765 --> 10:04.670
Don't get me wrong -- I'm
glad your show is helping
to get your name out there,

10:04.770 --> 10:08.641
but we want
that next book.

10:08.741 --> 10:09.976
<i>That's</i>
what's important.

10:10.076 --> 10:11.644
That's what counts.

10:16.782 --> 10:18.351
Just another minute.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.419
Couldn't we leave that in
a little longer?

10:20.486 --> 10:22.788
It's been such a nice respite
from all the complaining.

10:22.855 --> 10:25.091
I can't breathe.

10:25.157 --> 10:27.026
We can't understand you.

10:27.126 --> 10:29.595
With the thermometer
in my mouth --

10:29.662 --> 10:32.164
Would you prefer
the alternative?

10:32.264 --> 10:34.500
Don't worry, Doc.
I'll take the stick out first.

10:40.139 --> 10:44.110
Well, young man,
I'm ready to make my diagnosis.

10:44.176 --> 10:45.778
What is it, Doctor?
Tell me quickly.

10:45.845 --> 10:47.346
Rip the Band-Aid off.

10:47.446 --> 10:49.148
In all my years
in practice,

10:49.215 --> 10:51.317
I've never seen anything
quite like it.

10:51.384 --> 10:53.886
I knew it.
I knew it was bad.

10:53.986 --> 10:55.354
See?

10:55.454 --> 10:57.957
You have a mild flu.

10:58.024 --> 10:59.392
A mild flu, you say?

10:59.492 --> 11:01.394
Yes, he'll be fine
in a day or so.

11:01.494 --> 11:02.828
Get lots of rest.

11:02.895 --> 11:05.965
And, uh, some more
chicken soup wouldn't hurt.

11:06.032 --> 11:07.967
Oy.

11:08.034 --> 11:09.402
That's it, sweetheart.

11:09.502 --> 11:12.905
Now, be a good wife
and keep him full of liquids,

11:13.005 --> 11:14.473
and he'll be better
in no time.

11:14.540 --> 11:16.308
Wife? No, no.
No, no, no. No.

11:16.375 --> 11:17.877
Him and me?
No, we're not married.

11:17.977 --> 11:20.346
We're definitely
not married.

11:20.413 --> 11:21.480
Oh.

11:24.884 --> 11:27.753
Next time, you may want
to take the ring off,

11:27.853 --> 11:29.255
you son of a bitch.

11:32.091 --> 11:33.693
No, no, no.
No, wait. No.

11:33.759 --> 11:36.162
No, there's been
a misunderstanding.

12:07.393 --> 12:09.628
I'm not sure where
you can find a print.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.297
Perhaps at
the Public Library.

12:11.397 --> 12:12.965
"Integration
Report One."

12:13.065 --> 12:14.300
Okay,
I'll remember that.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.235
I'm sorry I didn't watch this
before we met.

12:16.302 --> 12:18.037
It all happened
so last minute.

12:18.104 --> 12:19.972
You don't need
to apologize.

12:20.072 --> 12:21.273
I would never have
made the film

12:21.373 --> 12:23.209
without
Ricky's encouragement.

12:23.275 --> 12:26.245
He spoke
very highly of you.

12:26.312 --> 12:30.149
But I have to warn you --
independent documentaries?

12:30.249 --> 12:32.318
Funding them is
almost impossible.

12:32.418 --> 12:33.986
I've nearly
given up myself.

12:34.086 --> 12:36.322
Oh, don't do that.
Don't tell my wife.

12:36.422 --> 12:38.657
Oh.

12:38.758 --> 12:39.658
Thank you.

12:41.393 --> 12:43.729
So, what's
your subject?

12:43.796 --> 12:45.464
I don't know.
Not yet.

12:45.564 --> 12:47.333
I just know there are
stories to be told --

12:47.433 --> 12:49.068
in Jackson,
Birmingham.

12:49.135 --> 12:50.603
If I go down there
with my camera --

12:50.669 --> 12:51.937
You're from Boston?

12:52.004 --> 12:54.006
Born and raised.

12:54.106 --> 12:57.576
The fight is happening
in your own backyard, Russ.

12:57.643 --> 12:59.411
You know about
the Freedom Campaign?

12:59.478 --> 13:01.847
Of course.

13:01.947 --> 13:03.849
There may not be laws
in Massachusetts

13:03.949 --> 13:06.185
that separate Black kids
from white ones,

13:06.285 --> 13:09.655
but Boston is as segregated
as Birmingham.

13:09.755 --> 13:11.991
Just go outside
and turn on your camera.

13:12.091 --> 13:15.327
Tell the story
of the Deep North.

13:22.868 --> 13:24.270
I'm embarrassed.

13:24.336 --> 13:26.872
No, I am.

13:26.972 --> 13:30.709
Thank you.
That's good advice.

13:30.810 --> 13:32.645
Such obvious,
good advice.

13:32.711 --> 13:34.980
And I had to come all the way
to New York to hear it.

13:35.047 --> 13:38.384
Public television is the place
to be doing this work, too.

13:38.484 --> 13:40.219
I'm talking to WNET.

13:40.319 --> 13:43.189
You get WGBH on board,
we'll work side by side.

13:43.289 --> 13:46.492
Ready to order?

13:46.559 --> 13:48.494
Oh, uh --

13:48.561 --> 13:50.229
Okay.

13:50.329 --> 13:52.198
What are you producing
for them now?

13:53.966 --> 13:56.068
Now?
Um, uh, not much.

13:56.168 --> 13:58.871
This show called
"The French Chef."

13:58.971 --> 14:00.206
Oh, my God.

14:00.306 --> 14:02.041
You're kidding.

14:02.141 --> 14:03.242
You know it?

14:03.342 --> 14:06.312
I've made
every single recipe.

14:06.378 --> 14:08.581
You work
with Julia Child?

14:08.681 --> 14:10.916
I do.

14:11.016 --> 14:13.986
Is she really as wonderful
as she seems?

14:14.053 --> 14:15.588
Yeah, I guess so.
Sure.

14:21.994 --> 14:24.530
Can you turn up
the heat again?

14:24.597 --> 14:25.764
I'm boiling, Paul.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.733
Well, then can you
check and see

14:27.833 --> 14:30.236
if there's a-an extra blanket
in the closet?

14:30.336 --> 14:32.671
I'm freezing.
My teeth are chattering.

14:32.738 --> 14:34.506
I could damage
my tongue.

14:36.242 --> 14:37.610
That's a good wife.

14:39.545 --> 14:41.280
Can you believe the nerve
of that guy?

14:41.380 --> 14:44.283
Why? I can see how he made
the assumption.

14:44.383 --> 14:45.451
Really?

14:45.551 --> 14:48.687
Well, maybe we should
get him back here, then,

14:48.754 --> 14:50.189
and check
your eyesight.

14:50.256 --> 14:53.792
Geez, Avis. Me thinks
thou doth protest too much.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.794
What's that
supposed to mean?

14:55.895 --> 14:57.463
You know exactly
what it means.

14:57.563 --> 14:59.632
Of course I know what it means.
I'm not an idiot.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.600
I just have no idea
why you're saying it.

15:01.700 --> 15:03.936
You're here,
aren't you?

15:04.036 --> 15:05.371
Someone had to
stay with you.

15:05.437 --> 15:08.474
Instead of being on your
hot date with Mr. Moneybags?

15:08.574 --> 15:12.645
Astor.
Mr. Moneybags-Astor.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.748
You love me.

15:15.814 --> 15:18.317
Admit it.
You love me.

15:18.417 --> 15:20.920
You've got someone
waiting for you,

15:20.986 --> 15:23.822
and you'd rather sit
at my sick bed.

15:28.661 --> 15:30.829
Do you want
some water?

15:30.930 --> 15:32.164
Great.
Go get it.

15:40.439 --> 15:43.676
You love me.

15:50.582 --> 15:51.850
You eat very quickly.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.019
Do I?

15:54.119 --> 15:56.355
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, I guess I do.

15:56.455 --> 15:58.590
My -- My mother
always scolded me,

15:58.657 --> 15:59.992
"Alice, you'll be done
with dinner before

16:00.092 --> 16:01.694
the rest of us have
finished our breakfast."

16:01.794 --> 16:03.195
Well, you've got
places to go.

16:03.295 --> 16:05.297
That is a generous
interpretation.

16:05.364 --> 16:08.200
No, I mean literally.
Y-You have places to go today.

16:08.300 --> 16:09.702
Oh, yes. Yes.
Well --

16:09.802 --> 16:11.370
I mean, there was
a whole negotiation

16:11.470 --> 16:13.305
between our mothers.

16:13.372 --> 16:15.040
Lunch, not dinner.

16:15.140 --> 16:16.775
60 minutes maximum.

16:16.842 --> 16:19.345
Yeah, but we came back with 90,
and we closed the deal.

16:20.879 --> 16:22.982
I wanted to meet you.

16:23.048 --> 16:26.385
It's just, my mother, she tries
to set me up on blind dates

16:26.485 --> 16:28.787
as much as she tries
to get me to go to church.

16:28.854 --> 16:30.556
This is the first time
I've said yes.

16:30.656 --> 16:32.057
Well, you're a stronger person
than I am.

16:32.157 --> 16:34.326
Oh, so I'm one
in a long line?

16:34.393 --> 16:36.395
Well, if it makes you
feel any better,

16:36.495 --> 16:38.364
I told my mother,
"This is it, alright?

16:38.464 --> 16:40.332
After this, I'm done."

16:40.399 --> 16:42.701
My first. Your last.
We have perfect timing.

16:47.172 --> 16:49.641
Um, so...
uh, you passed the bar.

16:49.708 --> 16:51.643
Yeah.
Oh, she told you that?

16:51.710 --> 16:53.345
And I accepted
a job, too.

16:53.412 --> 16:54.713
Oh, congratulations.

16:54.813 --> 16:56.749
I'm going to be
a public defender.

16:56.849 --> 16:59.485
I was supposed to take
this position at a big firm.

16:59.551 --> 17:01.487
My parents are
going to kill me.

17:01.553 --> 17:04.990
Because I spent all this time
and money going to law school

17:05.057 --> 17:08.560
only to take a job
that pays me nothing.

17:08.660 --> 17:11.697
But it's a job
I really want to do, so...

17:11.764 --> 17:14.099
Well,
I think that's cool.

17:14.199 --> 17:15.667
Tell me about being
a public defender.

17:15.734 --> 17:18.704
Oh, not until you
tell me about TV.

17:18.771 --> 17:20.372
Working in TV,
that's cool.

17:20.439 --> 17:22.775
Oh, you watch?

17:22.875 --> 17:26.545
"Perry Mason,"
"The Twilight Zone."

17:26.612 --> 17:29.848
Yeah, I-I don't make
any of those.

17:29.915 --> 17:31.116
Not yet.

17:41.527 --> 17:43.395
Oh, my.

17:43.462 --> 17:44.363
Oh!

17:44.430 --> 17:45.564
I'm sorry.

17:45.631 --> 17:48.567
I have just had an experience.

17:49.735 --> 17:51.103
I hope I'm
not interrupting.

17:51.203 --> 17:54.206
Oh, Andre, how nice.

17:54.273 --> 17:55.374
Hello.

17:55.441 --> 17:57.242
On the contrary.

17:57.309 --> 17:59.745
That was perhaps
the most exquisite meal

17:59.812 --> 18:01.780
I've had on this side
of the Atlantic.

18:01.880 --> 18:04.249
As grand as any meal
I've had in Paris.

18:04.316 --> 18:06.251
Bravo, Chef.

18:06.318 --> 18:07.653
I'm Julia Child.

18:07.753 --> 18:09.254
But of course
I know who you are.

18:09.321 --> 18:10.622
Oh, you do?

18:10.722 --> 18:11.723
You're the French Chef.

18:11.790 --> 18:13.725
Oh, well...

18:13.792 --> 18:16.628
No,<i> you're</i>
the French Chef.

18:18.330 --> 18:20.332
Exactly.

18:20.432 --> 18:21.834
You are as delightful
in color

18:21.934 --> 18:23.102
as you are
in black and white.

18:23.168 --> 18:28.574
Oh, well, being here
is like being in Oz,

18:28.640 --> 18:29.975
as well as in awe.

18:30.075 --> 18:32.611
I can't tell you how many people
come to Lutèce

18:32.678 --> 18:35.481
and ask for dishes you have
shown them on your program.

18:36.415 --> 18:38.684
We're even moving
sweetbreads.

18:38.784 --> 18:40.519
Ooh, how spectacular.

18:40.619 --> 18:44.089
But, uh, may I ask you
a small favor,<i> mon ami?</i>

18:44.156 --> 18:46.258
Oh, yes, of course.
Anything.

18:46.325 --> 18:48.527
Let's leave the real
cooking to the men,

18:48.627 --> 18:50.329
or I'll be out of
a job, eh?

18:50.429 --> 18:52.498
<i>La cuisine Francaise</i>
is no place for a woman.

18:52.598 --> 18:54.700
Not even
a French one.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.003
<i>à bientôt, Julia.</i>

18:58.103 --> 18:59.705
It was truly an honor.

19:04.843 --> 19:06.845
I'll get the check.

19:18.457 --> 19:20.492
How long
can one lunch last?

19:20.559 --> 19:21.693
You can go if you want.

19:21.793 --> 19:24.229
I told Julia I'd stay.

19:24.329 --> 19:27.199
Not everyone in this room
would agree with that statement.

19:29.668 --> 19:31.737
Why are you here, Avis?
Seriously.

19:31.837 --> 19:33.238
You clearly
don't like me --

19:33.338 --> 19:35.140
Clearly.

19:35.207 --> 19:36.675
And I'm agreeing
with you.

19:36.742 --> 19:38.310
Nice we can agree
on something.

19:47.853 --> 19:51.256
Frankly, Paul...

19:51.356 --> 19:55.060
as much as I've enjoyed
your infantile behavior,

19:55.160 --> 19:57.429
I'm not here
because of you.

19:57.529 --> 19:59.264
I'm here
because of me.

20:01.833 --> 20:03.435
Because, uh...

20:05.571 --> 20:08.507
Because I'm a chicken.

20:08.574 --> 20:11.210
And not the delicious kind.

20:11.276 --> 20:15.080
Your cold came
at a perfect time for me.

20:15.180 --> 20:18.217
Well, well, well.

20:18.283 --> 20:20.285
Your secret
is safe with me.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.692
I'll get you
a fresh compress.

20:26.758 --> 20:29.228
Thank you.

20:30.562 --> 20:34.132
When Bernard died,
everything changed.

20:34.233 --> 20:39.538
I retreated into myself,
away from everybody,

20:39.605 --> 20:42.574
even my own children.

20:42.641 --> 20:49.581
I honestly thought I'd never
find another co-conspirator.

20:49.648 --> 20:51.550
'Cause that's
what we were...

20:54.486 --> 20:57.889
Me and Bernard.

20:59.958 --> 21:03.595
And then
I did find one.

21:03.662 --> 21:05.564
With your wife.

21:09.268 --> 21:10.636
Hey.

21:18.143 --> 21:20.312
You won't believe it...

21:20.412 --> 21:24.449
...but that is
what happened to me.

21:24.516 --> 21:28.520
When Edith died,
I was lost,

21:28.620 --> 21:29.788
rootless.

21:32.291 --> 21:36.361
And then Julia waltzed
into my life.

21:40.832 --> 21:42.701
Well...

21:42.801 --> 21:45.037
The truth is, Paul,

21:45.137 --> 21:48.473
it'd be so much easier
if you were dead.

21:48.540 --> 21:50.375
Yes, I've felt that.

21:50.475 --> 21:53.879
Well, I-I have
a very big family.

21:53.979 --> 21:55.781
Two sisters.
Three brothers.

21:55.847 --> 21:57.549
Okay,
so you want six kids?

21:57.649 --> 21:58.950
How --
How many do you want?

21:59.017 --> 22:00.385
Not six.

22:00.485 --> 22:03.388
No, not any right now.
Not for a while.

22:03.488 --> 22:05.857
I have things
I want to do first.

22:05.957 --> 22:07.459
Okay. Okay.

22:07.526 --> 22:08.894
Oh, what?

22:08.994 --> 22:11.496
Well, my mother
would not approve.

22:11.563 --> 22:13.065
A wife who wants
to work

22:13.165 --> 22:15.467
instead of churning out
half-a-dozen grandchildren?

22:15.534 --> 22:17.402
Yeah, she'd hate me.

22:17.502 --> 22:19.805
Mine would hate you
even more.

22:19.871 --> 22:22.474
Well, you don't go to church.
Not even on Easter.

22:22.541 --> 22:23.842
You're going to make
no money.

22:23.909 --> 22:25.043
Yeah.

22:25.143 --> 22:26.545
Apparently,
you'll date anyone at all.

22:26.645 --> 22:27.846
You have no discernment.

22:29.681 --> 22:31.750
Oh, uh...

22:35.520 --> 22:36.922
Here you go.

22:41.560 --> 22:42.894
See me again tonight.

22:42.994 --> 22:45.197
I-I have
the gala tonight.

22:45.263 --> 22:46.865
Then after.

22:46.932 --> 22:48.934
Way after. Tomorrow.

22:49.034 --> 22:51.737
I have a train
in the morning.

22:51.837 --> 22:54.239
Okay.

22:54.339 --> 22:56.575
Well...

22:56.675 --> 23:01.747
here is my number.

23:07.452 --> 23:09.020
I'll be home all night.

23:13.058 --> 23:15.460
What's the point, Isaac?

23:15.560 --> 23:17.262
We have jobs in
two different cities.

23:17.362 --> 23:21.199
It makes no sense.

23:21.266 --> 23:24.803
But still,
there's my number.

23:24.903 --> 23:27.272
I'll be sitting very close
to the phone.

23:29.074 --> 23:31.410
Say yes. Say no.
I don't care.

23:31.476 --> 23:33.612
But you both need to go.
We're closed.

23:34.613 --> 23:36.314
Okay, okay.

23:36.415 --> 23:38.083
You okay?

23:38.150 --> 23:40.585
Oh, I'm perfectly fine.

23:40.652 --> 23:41.887
Blame the lack of
conversation

23:41.953 --> 23:45.123
on a bit of indigestion,
that's all.

23:45.223 --> 23:51.129
My eyes were bigger
than my stomach for once.

23:51.229 --> 23:53.398
Chocolate sauce.

23:53.465 --> 23:54.833
Right.

23:54.933 --> 23:56.168
I'll talk to her.

23:56.268 --> 23:58.570
That's just Blanche
being Blanche.

23:58.637 --> 24:00.572
Though she was
in top form today.

24:00.639 --> 24:02.507
No, I can take
a little criticism,

24:02.607 --> 24:03.975
particularly
from Blanche.

24:04.075 --> 24:05.010
But nothing can dull

24:05.110 --> 24:06.645
my excitement
for the day to come.

24:06.745 --> 24:09.514
We have a gala
to be honored at, Judith.

24:09.614 --> 24:11.349
Yes, we do!

24:11.450 --> 24:15.487
And that conversation with Andre
has sparked my thinking.

24:15.587 --> 24:17.923
Please. I want to eat
the man's food,

24:17.989 --> 24:19.624
not hear
his philosophy.

24:19.691 --> 24:22.027
Oh, no, no.

24:22.127 --> 24:24.129
He made his point.

24:24.196 --> 24:26.965
I'm going to attempt some
alterations to my speech.

24:27.032 --> 24:29.668
And all to the good,
I think.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.515
Oh, God,
don't wake him.

24:44.983 --> 24:47.385
You've been here
all this time?

24:47.486 --> 24:50.055
You're an angel,
that's what you are.

24:50.155 --> 24:51.556
We had fun.

24:51.656 --> 24:54.025
I've never paid
a babysitter before.

24:54.125 --> 24:58.396
This one's on the house.

24:58.497 --> 25:00.866
Just don't forget
to burp him in an hour.

25:28.560 --> 25:30.228
Home early today.

25:30.328 --> 25:32.531
I have to change
for the WNET Gala.

25:40.038 --> 25:41.940
You were too tough
on her today.

25:43.074 --> 25:44.409
What?

25:44.509 --> 25:45.911
That wasn't fair.

25:46.011 --> 25:48.413
I disagree.
The woman gushes and flutters.

25:48.513 --> 25:51.049
Shamed into it, I took a peek
at her program this afternoon.

25:51.116 --> 25:53.618
She mugs like
she's Lucille Ball.

25:53.718 --> 25:54.953
Careful, Blanche.

25:55.053 --> 25:56.855
You'll be known
as our resident Luddite.

25:56.922 --> 25:59.524
I'm all for progress.

25:59.591 --> 26:01.059
A chapter a week,
please.

26:06.264 --> 26:09.868
Maybe I'm taking
my frustration out
on the wrong person.

26:12.904 --> 26:14.606
Meaning what?

26:17.242 --> 26:18.977
You spend too much time
on cookbooks.

26:19.077 --> 26:20.946
Blanche, you just made
an argument for them

26:21.046 --> 26:22.047
today at lunch.

26:22.113 --> 26:23.381
Yes, for her.

26:23.448 --> 26:25.317
That's what she can do --
the best that she can do.

26:25.417 --> 26:27.052
She can write
cookbooks.

26:27.118 --> 26:29.454
You are
another story.

26:29.554 --> 26:30.655
It's one book.

26:30.755 --> 26:32.824
It's one book
on my list.

26:32.924 --> 26:35.126
That is not the point.

26:35.226 --> 26:38.096
I have been around the block,
Judith.

26:38.163 --> 26:40.632
I own the block.

26:40.732 --> 26:42.400
I can see
what's happening,

26:42.467 --> 26:43.668
where your heart is.

26:43.768 --> 26:45.770
So what?

26:45.837 --> 26:47.839
So what
if it gives me pleasure,

26:47.939 --> 26:49.608
if I enjoy spending time
with Julia Child?

26:49.674 --> 26:52.110
Because your legacy
is Anne Frank,

26:52.177 --> 26:53.812
Jean-Paul Sartre,
and Camus.

26:53.912 --> 26:56.448
You just won
the National Book Award.

26:56.514 --> 26:57.682
Okay?

26:57.782 --> 27:01.853
You are the preeminent
woman editor in the country.

27:01.953 --> 27:03.755
I have groomed you
to be that.

27:03.822 --> 27:06.458
There is no one else like you,
except me.

27:06.524 --> 27:08.994
That makes you an example
for all other women.

27:09.094 --> 27:10.996
And you cannot take
your stature,

27:11.096 --> 27:15.867
this opportunity you have
as a woman in this business

27:15.967 --> 27:18.503
and squander it
editing cookbooks.

27:18.603 --> 27:20.705
Let someone else do that.
Anyone else.

27:20.805 --> 27:23.441
You cannot.

27:23.508 --> 27:25.176
You cannot.

27:29.714 --> 27:32.717
I have a gala
to attend.

27:32.817 --> 27:34.552
I'll see you tomorrow,
Blanche.

28:18.830 --> 28:19.731
That is some dress.

28:19.831 --> 28:20.765
Oh, thank you, Russ.

28:20.865 --> 28:22.667
You look very dapper
yourself.

28:22.734 --> 28:24.836
No, I don't
own a tuxedo.

28:24.903 --> 28:26.771
Well,
handsome nonetheless.

28:26.871 --> 28:29.274
It's quite a crowd.

28:29.374 --> 28:32.610
Well, it's not
just for me.

28:32.711 --> 28:35.046
Shall we procure a drink
for fortification

28:35.113 --> 28:37.549
and then head in?

28:37.615 --> 28:39.451
Oh, he's under the weather,
unfortunately.

28:39.551 --> 28:40.952
Oh.

28:41.052 --> 28:43.121
Be my date
for the evening?

28:43.221 --> 28:44.456
Absolutely.

28:52.297 --> 28:54.199
You rang?

28:54.265 --> 28:56.034
I'm gonna be
late for the gala.

28:56.101 --> 28:57.469
That makes two of us.

28:57.569 --> 29:00.905
You're not dressed and --
You're sick as a dog.

29:02.540 --> 29:05.310
I'll be damned if I miss
this moment of hers.

29:05.410 --> 29:08.446
But these cufflinks come
from a circle of Hell

29:08.546 --> 29:10.482
I've only just now
become acquainted with.

29:10.582 --> 29:12.751
I'll trade you.

29:14.819 --> 29:16.454
You can help me
zip up my dress.

29:16.554 --> 29:18.656
Apparently, I'm wearing
something single ladies

29:18.757 --> 29:20.458
aren't supposed to put on
on their own.

29:20.558 --> 29:22.327
Good.
Shut the door.

29:27.599 --> 29:30.902
<i> Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>our emcee for this evening --</i>

29:30.969 --> 29:34.672
<i>the President</i>
<i>of the United States.</i>

29:37.942 --> 29:39.277
There's
a fella named Vaughn Meader

29:39.344 --> 29:40.845
running around,
pretending to be me,

29:40.945 --> 29:43.348
stealin'
all my best lines.

29:43.448 --> 29:46.017
"Ask not what you can do
for your country."

29:46.117 --> 29:48.653
That's my line.

29:48.753 --> 29:51.422
Apparently, Mr. Meader wasn't
available this evening.

29:51.489 --> 29:52.824
Am I late?
I was afraid I'd be late.

29:52.924 --> 29:56.528
Oh, not at all.
And how lovely you look.

29:56.628 --> 29:57.695
I'm so happy
to be here.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.197
Find your seat, Ma'am.

29:59.297 --> 30:01.366
Don't mind me.
Take any seat.

30:01.466 --> 30:03.168
It doesn't matter if you have
to turn around.

30:03.268 --> 30:05.303
There's nothing
to see up here anyway.

30:05.370 --> 30:06.771
Jackie's not coming
tonight.

30:08.973 --> 30:11.509
Oh, Judith.

30:11.609 --> 30:13.545
He's very good.
I've seen him before.

30:13.645 --> 30:15.446
Well, isn't this
jolly fun.

30:15.513 --> 30:18.016
Might as well
kick things off.

30:18.116 --> 30:21.786
To us,
to WGBH,

30:21.853 --> 30:23.488
and to
"The French Chef."

30:23.555 --> 30:24.656
Here, here.

30:26.457 --> 30:29.127
we're here to honor
public television,

30:29.194 --> 30:30.795
which Jackie tells me
means television

30:30.862 --> 30:34.632
that everyone has to pay for
and no one actually watches.

30:46.511 --> 30:49.647
But I told him, I said, "Nikita,
I can't take you anywhere."

30:49.714 --> 30:52.317
Oh, what are
you two doing?

30:52.383 --> 30:55.320
Oh, Paul,
this is too much.

30:55.386 --> 30:56.521
You're meant to be
in bed.

30:56.588 --> 30:58.089
I'm meant to be
with you, love.

30:58.189 --> 31:01.326
And Avis.

31:01.392 --> 31:05.196
Avis.
Oh, you gorgeous thing.

31:05.263 --> 31:06.931
It was a moment
of impetuousness,

31:07.031 --> 31:09.033
and I'm already
having second thoughts.

31:09.100 --> 31:10.401
Vanish the thought.

31:10.501 --> 31:12.604
...guests,
Mayor Wagner and his wife.

31:16.774 --> 31:18.943
And Congressman
Hugh Carey.

31:19.043 --> 31:22.046
And now I'd like to introduce
another very special guest.

31:22.113 --> 31:25.116
She's the author of "Mastering
the Art of French Cooking"

31:25.216 --> 31:28.453
and the host of
"The French Chef" on WGBH,

31:28.553 --> 31:30.588
now playing
across the country --

31:30.688 --> 31:32.023
Mrs. Julia Child.

31:36.227 --> 31:37.896
Just in time.

31:37.962 --> 31:39.063
I love you.

31:39.130 --> 31:40.231
I love you.

31:47.739 --> 31:50.275
Thank you,
Mr. President.

31:50.375 --> 31:53.244
I won't sing "Happy Birthday,"
if it's all the same to you.

31:56.080 --> 31:58.249
Oh, my.

31:58.316 --> 32:00.652
If you'll indulge me,

32:00.752 --> 32:05.123
permit an introduction
to the "French Chef" team.

32:05.223 --> 32:07.926
They're back there,
at table six.

32:07.992 --> 32:11.829
Judith Jones,
editor extraordinaire,

32:11.930 --> 32:13.831
who somehow
has found time for me

32:13.932 --> 32:16.100
amongst
the literary pantheon.

32:16.167 --> 32:18.336
And Hunter Fox,
our general manager,

32:18.436 --> 32:22.173
who believed a housewife could
make a television show.

32:22.273 --> 32:26.911
And Russ Morash, our dashing
director and producer,

32:26.978 --> 32:30.615
who actually makes
that television show.

32:30.682 --> 32:34.819
And brave, resourceful,
ingenious Alice Naman,

32:34.919 --> 32:39.457
fledgling producer
and one-day television pioneer.

32:39.524 --> 32:42.994
And then there is
my very best friend,

32:43.094 --> 32:44.829
Avis DeVoto...

32:44.929 --> 32:49.467
...and Paul Child,
my husband -- my partner,

32:49.534 --> 32:54.539
whom I hold in my heart
of hearts, first and last.

32:54.639 --> 32:56.207
Well, it tickles me
more than you know

32:56.307 --> 32:59.143
that our little show
has found an audience.

32:59.210 --> 33:03.214
But I suppose the response
I still get most from people is,

33:03.314 --> 33:05.116
"I'm sorry, what?"

33:06.985 --> 33:11.022
"What does that possibly mean,
a show about cooking?

33:11.122 --> 33:12.490
You cook and we watch,

33:12.557 --> 33:15.159
and then we watch as you eat
what you've just cooked?

33:15.226 --> 33:16.527
Am I missing something?"

33:18.162 --> 33:20.331
And I answer this way --

33:20.398 --> 33:24.469
that what we're actually making
is a travel program;

33:24.535 --> 33:26.904
that television
is like a window,

33:27.005 --> 33:31.576
and the best of it opens
to the most remarkable places;

33:31.676 --> 33:34.579
that food itself
is like a passport;

33:34.679 --> 33:39.183
that the culture, the history
is locked inside the flavors

33:39.250 --> 33:43.021
and the aromas that are
unique to each cuisine.

33:45.156 --> 33:47.525
I don't cook for chefs.

33:47.592 --> 33:49.093
I cook for other cooks.

33:49.193 --> 33:52.530
For ordinary people --
mostly women, housewives --

33:52.597 --> 33:56.034
and I say to them,
you have endless horizons,

33:56.100 --> 33:59.604
far beyond the walls of your
house, your block, your town.

33:59.704 --> 34:02.540
The whole world
is your oyster --

34:02.607 --> 34:04.542
quite literally.

34:04.609 --> 34:09.113
And if you take the time it
requires to make a great meal,

34:09.213 --> 34:14.218
then you may feel the same
sense of accomplishment,

34:14.285 --> 34:18.189
of mastery, that I feel.

34:18.256 --> 34:20.758
And because
I'm not a chef --

34:20.858 --> 34:24.262
I'm not always
a very good cook --

34:24.362 --> 34:29.300
because I fail,
they tend to believe it.

34:29.400 --> 34:33.471
And so we go on
this journey together.

34:33.571 --> 34:35.807
And that is owing
to all of you

34:35.907 --> 34:40.044
and your support
of public television.

34:40.111 --> 34:44.749
And so I say thank you
and bon appétit.

34:57.094 --> 34:59.330
Well, I have to
introduce her to Lady Bird.

34:59.430 --> 35:01.332
Jackie and I are tired of
eating King Ranch Chicken

35:01.432 --> 35:03.234
every Sunday night
at Lyndon's place.

35:04.502 --> 35:05.903
Well, folks,
enjoy your main course.

35:05.970 --> 35:09.340
You are a marvel.
And thank you.

35:09.440 --> 35:12.410
Well,
every word is true.

35:12.477 --> 35:14.178
And you may relax now.

35:14.278 --> 35:17.081
The speech was better
for Andre's intervention.

35:19.517 --> 35:21.686
And Russ.

35:21.786 --> 35:23.154
Thank you.

35:23.254 --> 35:24.422
Julia.

35:24.489 --> 35:26.257
You have no idea
how much it means to me

35:26.324 --> 35:28.159
that you said
what you did --

35:28.259 --> 35:29.994
not just about me,

35:30.094 --> 35:31.129
about what you do.

35:31.195 --> 35:33.498
Oh, it's what<i> we</i> do.

35:33.598 --> 35:34.866
Thank you, Alice.

35:34.966 --> 35:36.501
One more thing?

35:36.601 --> 35:37.702
Oh, I've been waiting
for this moment

35:37.802 --> 35:39.637
for what feels
like my entire life,

35:39.704 --> 35:41.339
so I know this
is a little peculiar,

35:41.439 --> 35:46.043
but would it be entirely
unforgivable if I leave early?

35:48.379 --> 35:51.382
I forbid you to stay.

35:53.518 --> 35:54.886
Thank you.

36:13.204 --> 36:14.739
What are you doing here?

36:14.839 --> 36:16.707
Well, who were
you calling?

36:18.676 --> 36:20.077
Let's go.

36:28.052 --> 36:29.587
Wait.

36:44.936 --> 36:48.206
Well, I need to get
my blood moving again.

36:48.272 --> 36:49.740
Ladies' room?

36:49.840 --> 36:50.942
Pass.

36:51.042 --> 36:53.544
Ah.

36:53.611 --> 36:55.780
I'm going to the bar.
Refresh?

36:55.880 --> 36:58.115
Please.

36:59.750 --> 37:02.787
Ooh.

37:02.887 --> 37:05.456
My legs are
ostentatiously long,

37:05.556 --> 37:07.625
but I do get to meet
my table neighbor.

37:07.725 --> 37:09.060
Betty Friedan.
Nice to meet you,

37:09.126 --> 37:10.361
even over the shoulder.

37:10.428 --> 37:12.763
Oh, Betty Friedan.
My goodness.

37:12.863 --> 37:15.633
I'm seated in a lively
neighborhood.

37:15.733 --> 37:17.368
I just bought
your book.

37:17.435 --> 37:20.304
Apologies in advance,
but I haven't read it yet.

37:20.404 --> 37:23.708
The television schedule
is a hard taskmaster.

37:23.774 --> 37:25.810
I'd be very interested
to hear what you think.

37:25.910 --> 37:28.746
Oh, well, then,
we shall speak.

37:28.813 --> 37:31.082
You wouldn't mind joining me
at a seat over here, would you?

37:31.148 --> 37:35.052
Otherwise, I may not be able to
move my neck in the morning.

37:38.089 --> 37:39.724
Oh.

37:40.825 --> 37:42.893
Ooh.
Lovely pearls.

37:42.960 --> 37:44.495
Oh, they belonged to
my mother.

37:44.595 --> 37:45.496
Thank you.

37:50.268 --> 37:51.235
Good evening.

37:51.302 --> 37:52.470
What can I get you?

37:52.570 --> 37:54.839
Dirty martini.

37:54.939 --> 37:56.507
Make that two.

38:02.280 --> 38:04.115
We're trapped by it.

38:04.181 --> 38:06.017
Women are.

38:06.117 --> 38:07.351
By the feminine mystique?

38:07.451 --> 38:10.354
By its assumptions.

38:10.454 --> 38:12.757
Well, that women are meant
to find fulfillment

38:12.823 --> 38:14.525
in -- in -- in -- in
housework,

38:14.625 --> 38:16.127
marriage,
child rearing.

38:16.193 --> 38:17.762
As opposed
to what men do.

38:17.828 --> 38:18.863
Exactly.

38:18.963 --> 38:22.166
And is that a choice,
either/or?

38:22.266 --> 38:24.869
Uh, well,
look at the world.

38:24.969 --> 38:26.470
Well,
I'm childless myself.

38:26.537 --> 38:31.442
But for me, I haven't
found that to be the case.

38:31.509 --> 38:33.144
Well, in all candor,
Mrs. Child --

38:33.210 --> 38:34.478
Oh, Julia.

38:36.514 --> 38:38.282
You're not
a good example.

38:39.984 --> 38:41.552
Of your argument,
you mean?

38:41.652 --> 38:44.722
Or to others?

38:47.224 --> 38:50.628
Let's not have
this conversation here.

38:50.695 --> 38:52.063
Oh, but we are
having it.

38:52.163 --> 38:54.732
And whatever needs to be said
should be said.

38:58.803 --> 39:01.038
I don't know you.

39:01.138 --> 39:02.740
But I have seen
your program,

39:02.840 --> 39:04.709
and it's not
helping things.

39:06.844 --> 39:08.512
Well, that is
your opinion.

39:08.579 --> 39:10.915
Yes.

39:11.015 --> 39:13.217
You think you're
opening doors for women,

39:13.317 --> 39:15.252
expanding their horizons.

39:15.353 --> 39:17.054
They may be dreaming
of France,

39:17.154 --> 39:19.423
but they're stuck in front
of a hot stove.

39:19.523 --> 39:22.760
Your show is 30 minutes,

39:22.860 --> 39:24.228
but that's an illusion,
Mrs. Child.

39:24.328 --> 39:27.531
Your recipes take days to make
and hours to clean up.

39:27.598 --> 39:29.100
A good meatloaf
isn't enough anymore?

39:29.200 --> 39:31.402
Now women have to prepare meals
worthy of the finest chefs

39:31.502 --> 39:34.105
and still leave time for
the children and the laundry?

39:34.205 --> 39:36.340
You've nicely raised the bar
on what it means to be

39:36.407 --> 39:38.008
a good wife
to professional levels.

39:38.075 --> 39:39.543
Now, see here --

39:39.610 --> 39:42.446
who you have
locked in the kitchen,

39:42.546 --> 39:44.348
possibly find time
for anything else,

39:44.415 --> 39:47.118
let alone a career?

39:47.218 --> 39:49.920
How rude!

39:50.020 --> 39:52.189
And you have no conception
of what she's doing.

39:52.256 --> 39:54.125
I'm sorry, who are you?

39:54.225 --> 39:55.259
Oh, her husband.

39:55.359 --> 39:57.728
You're not helping things,
Paul.

40:02.867 --> 40:04.435
If you'll excuse me.

40:06.704 --> 40:08.239
Darling, uh...

40:13.077 --> 40:14.478
Was that
necessary?

40:14.578 --> 40:17.782
Not now,
but in general.

40:18.949 --> 40:21.485
You've entirely missed
the point of her, lady.

40:47.445 --> 40:49.980
Mind if I join you?

40:50.080 --> 40:51.615
Oh, suit yourself.

40:54.285 --> 40:58.355
I saw you
from across the way.

40:58.456 --> 41:00.758
Thought maybe you could use
some company.

41:05.963 --> 41:09.200
I'm sorry.

41:09.300 --> 41:10.868
For what?

41:13.637 --> 41:18.342
I enjoyed your speech
very much.

41:18.442 --> 41:21.378
A travel show,

41:21.479 --> 41:24.048
I like that.

41:24.148 --> 41:27.885
Well, I'm not sure
everyone agrees with you.

41:27.985 --> 41:31.388
There are people in there
who positively can't stand me.

41:32.490 --> 41:35.559
Well, I like you.

41:35.659 --> 41:38.696
I like you
just the way you are.

41:41.131 --> 41:43.367
Thank you.

41:43.467 --> 41:45.135
Thank you for that.

41:47.171 --> 41:48.806
I'm Julia.

41:48.873 --> 41:52.409
Hello, Julia.
I'm Fred.

41:52.510 --> 41:55.412
Hello, Fred.

41:55.513 --> 41:57.581
I know I should probably
go back in,

41:57.681 --> 42:00.751
but would you mind
just sitting here with me

42:00.851 --> 42:03.187
for another moment?

42:03.254 --> 42:05.155
I wouldn't mind at all.
