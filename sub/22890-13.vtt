11:42.300 --> 11:43.700

James because he's the one

24:58.133 --> 24:59.567
where I'm taking care
of everything.

25:01.166 --> 25:03.033
The freakin' pregnancy test
takes so long,

25:03.033 --> 25:04.033
and I was like

25:04.066 --> 25:05.300
Just shove it in there?

25:05.300 --> 25:08.033
- No, Jax, you pee on it.
- Oh.

25:11.033 --> 25:12.567

25:12.567 --> 25:13.700

25:13.734 --> 25:15.567
Get your ass in there.

25:15.567 --> 25:17.166
- Hello.
- Hi.

25:17.200 --> 25:19.033
- So we're just here

25:19.033 --> 25:21.033
to look at some, uh, different

25:21.066 --> 25:22.667
restaurant equipment.
- Okay.

25:22.700 --> 25:24.166
- Well, we have to wait
for our bosses

25:24.200 --> 25:25.567
to get here.
- Well, not our--

25:25.567 --> 25:26.700
- Our business partners,
not our bosses.

25:26.734 --> 25:28.100
- Yeah.
- Okay.

25:28.133 --> 25:29.567

25:31.033 --> 25:32.300
- I see.
- Yeah.

25:32.333 --> 25:34.233
- Okay, what I'd like
you guys to do

25:34.266 --> 25:37.500
is if we see anything take
pictures of everything

25:37.533 --> 25:39.033
and then you write
the thing down, okay?

25:39.066 --> 25:40.200
both: Okay.

25:40.200 --> 25:41.433
- I like every restaurant

25:41.467 --> 25:43.200
to have its own personality,

25:43.233 --> 25:46.333
and Tom-Tom is going
to be something

25:46.333 --> 25:48.166
totally different
to all of them.

25:48.200 --> 25:49.433
- We have our steel light
show room

25:49.467 --> 25:51.066
back here
which we can start in.

25:51.100 --> 25:52.533
- Yeah, sure.

25:52.567 --> 25:54.734
- I have this vision
for Tom-Tom.

25:54.734 --> 25:56.400
It's not going to be pretty,

25:56.433 --> 26:00.066
but it's going to be
industrial romantic.

26:00.066 --> 26:01.533
Have a look.
I like this.

26:01.567 --> 26:03.200
- Yes.
- That's quite sexy.

26:03.200 --> 26:04.600
- It's nice. I like that.
- That's really cool.

26:04.600 --> 26:06.433
Yes.
- Industrial, sexy now.

26:06.467 --> 26:08.567
- Never break either.
Now.

26:08.600 --> 26:11.066
I want to see wrought iron

26:11.066 --> 26:14.533
coupled with some chandeliers,
Edison bulbs.

26:14.567 --> 26:16.600
It's gonna be a little bit
more architectural.

26:16.600 --> 26:18.467
Can I do a little table
to put together

26:18.467 --> 26:20.066
the things we like?

26:20.066 --> 26:21.734
- Absolutely.
- These are timeless.

26:21.767 --> 26:23.233
Like, these will never go out
of style, right?

26:23.266 --> 26:24.500
- No, and I think these
are really cute.

26:24.500 --> 26:26.233
- I love that.

26:26.233 --> 26:28.233
My opinion--ah, my opinion
doesn't really matter.

26:28.266 --> 26:30.100
This is all you two, but--
- I think your opinion

26:30.100 --> 26:32.100
really does matter.
I mean, I'll never use it.

26:32.100 --> 26:34.066
I'll always override it,
but it still matters.

26:34.100 --> 26:35.166
- I like this one, Lisa.

26:35.200 --> 26:36.500
- Thank you.

26:36.533 --> 26:38.166
- Lisa, this is really classy.

26:38.200 --> 26:39.633
This is very masculine.

26:39.633 --> 26:41.367
It's like--
- That is not very masculine.

26:41.367 --> 26:44.500
Tom-Tom's gonna have a real
masculine edge to it.

26:44.533 --> 26:47.233
That is not a man's glass.
- Well, sometimes it is.

26:47.233 --> 26:48.633
- Sometimes I like
a dainty glass.

26:48.633 --> 26:50.467
- Unlike Tom and Tom.

26:50.500 --> 26:51.633
How much?

26:51.633 --> 26:52.600
- How 'bout if you buy one

26:52.633 --> 26:54.100
and I give you one free?

26:54.133 --> 26:55.767
- Oh, what, you mean
if I buy 100

26:56.000 --> 26:57.233
and you give me 100 free?
- I'll give you 100 free.

26:57.233 --> 26:58.500
- I love that.

26:58.500 --> 27:00.367
Do you like that?
- Yeah, I love it.

27:00.367 --> 27:01.633
- This doesn't happen
every day.

27:01.667 --> 27:04.500
I'm shopping
with Lisa Vanderpump.

27:04.533 --> 27:07.734
That's like playing one-on-one
with LeBron James.

27:07.767 --> 27:09.400
- So I love all of this.

27:09.433 --> 27:12.066
I'd like to just take
a picture of the table,

27:12.100 --> 27:14.333
and then send me kind
of an itemized price.

27:14.367 --> 27:16.000
- Absolutely.

27:16.033 --> 27:17.667
Thank you so much.
- Thank you, Joe, thank you.

27:17.700 --> 27:20.667
Um, I think this worked
really well, yes?

27:20.667 --> 27:22.667
Tom and Tom were actually
on time.

27:22.667 --> 27:24.133

Sandoval and Schwartz can
listen and learn.

27:28.033 --> 27:29.467
So, who knows?

27:29.500 --> 27:31.500
Maybe this partnership
will work out after all.

- Katie and I were

this must be what it's like
to be a trophy wife.

30:21.433 --> 30:22.533

30:22.567 --> 30:24.333
- The decision for Tom

30:24.367 --> 30:27.333
to partner with Ken and Lisa
was terrifying to him,

30:27.367 --> 30:30.467
but to see him excited

30:30.500 --> 30:32.300
it makes me so happy
because this is

30:32.300 --> 30:33.567
all I ever wanted for him.

30:33.600 --> 30:35.033
- I'm gonna do the fillet.

30:38.734 --> 30:40.533

has been

31:40.500 --> 31:43.066
an amazing,
humungous success, you know?

31:43.066 --> 31:45.200

31:50.467 --> 31:52.000
So now we're doing bigger

31:52.033 --> 31:53.333
from flyers to posters.

31:53.367 --> 31:55.633

31:55.667 --> 31:57.367

31:59.333 --> 32:01.767
How was your studio session?
I saw you on the Instagram.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.433
Felt pretty left out.

32:04.467 --> 32:07.567
- Scheana was there,
and real quick,

32:07.600 --> 32:09.367
the last time Scheana was there

32:09.400 --> 32:11.700
she was recording her own song

32:11.734 --> 32:13.367
and she was married to Shay.

32:13.367 --> 32:15.100
So I put her ass in the booth.

32:15.100 --> 32:16.100
- Hit it.

32:16.133 --> 32:18.166
- ♪ Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo ♪

32:19.266 --> 32:21.500

32:23.266 --> 32:24.433

feeling though.

32:24.467 --> 32:25.633
- Okay.

32:25.633 --> 32:27.500
- I love Scheana
with all my heart

32:27.533 --> 32:29.767
but the girl is tone-deaf.

32:29.767 --> 32:31.367
Obviously I'm gonna
cut her part

32:31.400 --> 32:33.367
because the song,

32:33.367 --> 32:36.100
it's called "For You,"
and it's very much my baby.

32:36.133 --> 32:38.000
- It's yours.
- Exactly.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.533
- Will your man be
at the show case?

32:41.166 --> 32:42.667
- Probably, yes,
to support you,

32:42.700 --> 32:44.233
but I know he's very busy.

32:44.266 --> 32:45.400
- No, he's busy.

32:45.433 --> 32:47.500
He's working on
real life stuff.

32:47.533 --> 32:49.066
- It's just kind of sad
that, like,

32:49.100 --> 32:51.266
Lala's man can't ----ing
take a night off

32:51.266 --> 32:53.500
from cutting into a ----ing
steak at Mastro's

32:53.533 --> 32:55.533
over some bullsh-- meeting
probably

41:00.266 --> 41:01.467
Ken.

41:03.000 --> 41:04.367
- I'll send you guys a picture
of it.

41:04.400 --> 41:05.767
- Oh, no, carry on.

41:06.000 --> 41:07.667
Talk--do what you guys
were doing.

41:07.700 --> 41:09.000
I just want to talk to Ken
about something.

41:09.033 --> 41:10.100
- Sure, sure.
- Okay.

41:10.133 --> 41:12.133
So, you know, like...

41:12.133 --> 41:14.000
Sorry, but they were just
driving me crazy

41:14.000 --> 41:16.266
because they're not
understanding that this is

41:16.266 --> 41:18.266
a very short amount
of time that we've got

41:18.300 --> 41:20.533
I think maybe I need
to redefine their roles.

41:20.533 --> 41:22.667
There's got to be a place
for a couple of tossers

41:22.700 --> 41:25.100
that I need
to fill somewhere.

41:27.033 --> 41:28.734
Do you know what tossers are?

41:28.767 --> 41:30.400
- She's a little irritated
with us I think.

41:30.433 --> 41:33.667
Let's chill right now--Tom.

41:33.700 --> 41:35.500
- I mean, they're making
decisions, dude.

41:35.533 --> 41:37.266
- I know, but we're half drunk.

41:37.266 --> 41:39.133
And, um,

41:39.166 --> 41:40.567
we need to tread lightly
right now.

41:40.600 --> 41:43.700
- You will give us enough
shelves to fit on top.

41:43.700 --> 41:45.500
- I'm sorry to interrupt.
- Up there.

41:45.533 --> 41:47.567
- I was, uh--I want to
show you something real quick.

41:47.567 --> 41:50.000
- No, no, sorry.
Can you just give us a second?

41:50.033 --> 41:52.233
One second.
So you've got--we need enough

41:52.266 --> 41:55.300
to make sure we've got
a display, yeah.

41:57.467 --> 41:59.567
I might have said too much.

41:59.567 --> 42:02.100
Maybe I drank too much.

42:02.133 --> 42:05.033
I really hope she's not,
like, pissed.

42:05.033 --> 42:08.233
I hope she's not questioning
our partnership.

42:08.266 --> 42:09.500
The last thing I want.

42:09.533 --> 42:12.300
- Dude. My liver is pickled.

42:14.300 --> 42:16.667
- Next time on
"Vanderpump Rules"...

42:16.700 --> 42:19.233
all: Put it on!
Put it on!

42:21.500 --> 42:23.700
- You look like you work
for UPS.

42:23.734 --> 42:25.266
- I got a package to deliver.

42:25.300 --> 42:26.700
- Cheers, bitches.

42:26.734 --> 42:28.700
How are y'all's vaginas?

42:28.734 --> 42:30.333
- If I had your punonie,

42:30.333 --> 42:32.734
I would have chosen
porn as my job.

42:32.767 --> 42:34.400
- Oh, my God.
- You did so good.

42:34.433 --> 42:35.600
- I'm putting on my jacket

42:35.600 --> 42:37.667
so my dad thinks
I'm more smart.

42:37.700 --> 42:39.600
- Hey.
- Hi.

42:39.600 --> 42:41.200
- Keeping it gangsta.

42:41.233 --> 42:43.533
- London gangsta.

42:43.567 --> 42:45.734
- Jeremy asked me out
on a date.

42:45.767 --> 42:47.467
- I mean you're going to like
a public place, right?

42:47.500 --> 42:49.734
- He's a little creepy.

42:49.767 --> 42:51.333
- Yeah.

42:51.367 --> 42:53.600
- All I said was
that he's creepy.

42:53.600 --> 42:54.734
He's creepy.

42:54.767 --> 42:56.700
Excuse me?

42:56.734 --> 42:58.000
Stassi--

42:58.033 --> 42:59.000
- Then you can ----ing leave.

42:59.033 --> 43:00.066
- You guys make up lies.

43:00.066 --> 43:01.266
I'll start telling truths

43:01.300 --> 43:02.734
about you guys.
- Oh, my God.

43:02.767 --> 43:04.367
- To see more of
"Vanderpump Rules,"
