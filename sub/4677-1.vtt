Carhartts, drive trucks,

That boy is everywhere.

19:51.690 --> 19:52.756
OK, open your fist.

20:04.603 --> 20:05.869
Why don't you just
go as yourself?

20:05.970 --> 20:08.739
Or you could go as
a mean older brother.

20:08.840 --> 20:10.874
Then we won't need any costumes.

20:10.975 --> 20:12.309
Or I could go as a bullfighter.

Well, you have to
make up your own mind.

getting ready for bed?

20:48.212 --> 20:50.281
Can't he do
anything by himself?

You will catch me at work.

21:05.697 --> 21:07.998
BETTY: Paula.

21:08.099 --> 21:08.865
What?

21:08.966 --> 21:11.067
He makes me feel better.

21:11.169 --> 21:11.902
[chuckle]

21:12.003 --> 21:13.470
MAN (ON RADIO): Did it grow?

21:13.571 --> 21:16.440
Last summer's drought was a
killer for retail food prices.

21:16.541 --> 21:22.846
We talk a lot of about
consumers, but the farmer--

22:36.554 --> 22:39.923
[dog barking]

24:00.705 --> 24:02.005
SAM: Off with your head.

24:04.509 --> 24:06.743
Can't believe you were
sleeping with all that light

24:06.845 --> 24:07.010
in your eyes.

24:10.081 --> 24:11.014
Made up my mind.

24:13.785 --> 24:16.252
Of course you have.

24:16.354 --> 24:17.521
I'm going to
Scratch's with you.

24:26.030 --> 24:27.831
Don't you want to be
home with the boys?

24:27.932 --> 24:29.032
Oh, they're fine.

24:29.133 --> 24:30.033
They're sick of me.

24:33.371 --> 24:35.271
I want to start working again.

24:35.373 --> 24:36.540
I don't want you around it.

24:43.114 --> 24:44.047
I've seen the papers.

24:49.888 --> 24:53.056
Papers, barn.

24:56.794 --> 24:57.360
Frank.

24:57.562 --> 24:58.061
We have time.

25:02.199 --> 25:06.302
[music playing on radio]

25:06.404 --> 25:07.704
Hey, Fin.

25:07.805 --> 25:08.672
Hey, Paula.

25:08.773 --> 25:10.240
[inaudible].

25:10.341 --> 25:10.974
Yeah.

25:11.075 --> 25:14.244
Here, give that to me.

25:14.345 --> 25:14.945
Thanks.

25:15.046 --> 25:17.681
Thanks for the car.

25:17.782 --> 25:18.682
Good luck.

25:18.783 --> 25:19.082
All right.

25:53.718 --> 25:55.118
It's nice to meet you.

26:45.236 --> 26:46.837
Morning, guys.

26:46.938 --> 26:48.005
Hey, Jimmy.

26:48.106 --> 26:49.906
Got the atrazine
to the crop duster.

26:50.008 --> 26:51.141
Uh, where's Scratch at?

26:51.242 --> 26:52.776
Out with the birds.

26:52.877 --> 26:55.679
Oh, you go see Scratch
and I'm going to unload.

27:05.156 --> 27:08.025
Been a few years since
you've been out here.

27:08.126 --> 27:10.027
You're getting a little
bony for my taste.

27:10.128 --> 27:14.364
Well, I ain't one of
your sows, Scratch.

27:14.465 --> 27:17.367
Well, it's not
daddy's farm anymore.

27:17.468 --> 27:17.701
Mm-mm.

27:24.175 --> 27:25.441
We're doing too
much, to be honest.

27:25.543 --> 27:28.244
I can hardly keep
things straight.

27:28.345 --> 27:31.682
We should, uh, we should
set up a regular shipment.

27:31.783 --> 27:33.383
Frank and I have
things worked out.

27:33.484 --> 27:36.119
Well, that way you don't
even have to think about it.

27:36.220 --> 27:37.688
We moved on from on
just feeding seed.

27:37.789 --> 27:40.791
We stock or can stock almost
every medication, antibiotics,

27:40.892 --> 27:44.027
hormone, herbicide, you
name it that you've used.

27:44.128 --> 27:46.296
She's excited.

27:46.397 --> 27:47.864
Hadn't been out in a while.

27:47.965 --> 27:50.033
Well, we should be supplying
you with most of your stuff

27:50.134 --> 27:51.534
like we used to.

27:51.635 --> 27:54.370
Gigas sells me my
feed same as you did

27:54.471 --> 27:56.173
and they unload my products.

27:56.273 --> 27:58.408
I get what I need,
doesn't get easier.

27:58.509 --> 28:00.543
They're squeezing you.

28:00.644 --> 28:02.212
They're squeezing you too.

28:02.313 --> 28:03.680
You might as well
be a tenant farmer.

28:03.781 --> 28:07.851
At least I'm
still in the black.

28:07.952 --> 28:11.454
Scratch, we need the work.

28:11.555 --> 28:14.257
Like I told Frank, I got a
little job you could do for me.

28:23.500 --> 28:27.738
I've been using every bit of
persuasion and charm I have--

28:27.839 --> 28:29.906
You think we're just going
to wish our problems away?

28:30.007 --> 28:32.075
...to keep Scratch and every
other client we still got.

28:32.176 --> 28:34.778
[bell ringing]

28:36.848 --> 28:39.950
BETTY: What was that job
Scratch was talking about?

28:40.051 --> 28:42.552
FRANK: It's not
on the up and up.

28:42.653 --> 28:45.255
BETTY: Why would he come to
us with something illegal?

28:45.356 --> 28:48.591
And then think that we would
do something like that?

28:48.692 --> 28:54.430
Margins are tight, some
people are willing to bend.

28:54.531 --> 28:57.801
[children yelling]

29:00.238 --> 29:03.573
I'm close with McKibbin.

29:03.674 --> 29:04.975
How much is the system worth?

29:05.076 --> 29:07.144
Phew, more than
10 house payments.

29:07.245 --> 29:08.645
He was impressed, he
was real impressed

29:08.746 --> 29:10.113
when I talked him through it.

29:10.214 --> 29:13.784
He said he just had
to run the numbers.

29:13.885 --> 29:14.317
There he is.

29:31.602 --> 29:33.970
ELENA: 'Course I'll do it.

29:34.071 --> 29:35.005
Ickentas.

29:35.106 --> 29:37.207
I'm not a chicken.

29:37.308 --> 29:39.142
[speaking spanish]

29:39.243 --> 29:41.278
No, you get in.

29:41.378 --> 29:43.146
You don't know how to swim?

29:43.380 --> 29:44.014
'Course I do.

29:44.115 --> 29:45.949
Eat it.

29:46.050 --> 29:46.850
No.

29:46.951 --> 29:48.484
Put it in your mouth.

29:48.585 --> 29:50.887
Ew.

29:50.988 --> 29:53.656
Chicken.

29:53.858 --> 29:54.357
ELENA: Chicken.

30:20.684 --> 30:23.286
Thought you might have some
questions about the system.

30:23.387 --> 30:25.155
Oh, your demo
was very thorough.

30:25.256 --> 30:28.091
Well, I'd love to go over it
again with you, Mr. McKibbin.

30:28.192 --> 30:29.425
Oh, that's all right.

30:29.526 --> 30:32.695
All right, you ready to
write that check then?

30:32.864 --> 30:33.496
Come on, Frank.

30:33.597 --> 30:34.797
You know the deal.

30:34.899 --> 30:35.932
Oh, I'm giving it to
you at nearly cost.

30:36.033 --> 30:37.267
I can't do any better.

30:37.368 --> 30:39.402
I buy the system from
Gigas, they buy my home.

30:45.009 --> 30:45.976
I need this one.

30:46.077 --> 30:47.410
It's just the way it is.

31:00.424 --> 31:03.894
[child shouting]

31:06.397 --> 31:06.930
Indian summer.

31:11.068 --> 31:13.169
Close your eyes.

31:13.271 --> 31:15.671
Come on.

31:15.773 --> 31:16.439
Close 'em.

31:20.177 --> 31:21.044
Let's see now.

31:21.145 --> 31:24.080
Does-- does it go in here?

31:24.181 --> 31:25.115
No?

31:25.216 --> 31:26.983
OK, maybe it goes in here.

31:27.084 --> 31:27.817
Stop.

31:27.919 --> 31:27.984
Does it go here?

31:38.229 --> 31:39.261
500?

31:41.532 --> 31:42.966
Down payment on the
system from McKibbin.

31:46.003 --> 31:49.139
It's a done deal.

31:49.240 --> 31:49.472
Frank.

31:53.210 --> 31:56.479
[exhale]

32:17.868 --> 32:20.770
You gonna finish that in time?

32:20.871 --> 32:24.441
That don't look
like a pirate vest.

32:24.541 --> 32:27.510
Looks more frontier boy.

32:27.611 --> 32:29.512
I'm gonna whip you,
you keep that up.

32:44.362 --> 32:45.528
Looks like it's
moving or something.

32:49.200 --> 32:50.300
Yeah?

32:50.501 --> 32:51.034
It's good.

32:56.307 --> 32:56.539
Thanks.

32:59.377 --> 33:00.043
FRANK: But it's not real.

33:04.915 --> 33:08.851
I ought to make you come
out with me some time.

33:08.952 --> 33:12.288
You need to see what it's
like to get your hands dirty.

33:12.390 --> 33:13.756
You're right.

33:13.857 --> 33:15.091
There's a real future for
me in the family business.

33:15.192 --> 33:18.061
I want that tech school
application in my hands

33:18.162 --> 33:18.828
tomorrow.

33:19.030 --> 33:19.562
You got me?

33:24.535 --> 33:26.069
Boy thinks he's too
good for the real world.

33:38.416 --> 33:39.949
[knocking]

33:40.051 --> 33:40.583
Finley, open up.

33:57.134 --> 34:02.372
He-- we were raised
thinking that--

34:02.473 --> 34:04.107
You don't have to
excuses for him.

34:07.911 --> 34:13.416
You both worried
about a lot of things.

34:13.617 --> 34:14.117
I'm not stupid.

34:23.893 --> 34:26.129
Why don't you teach me
how to use your pipe?

34:29.900 --> 34:31.167
What?

34:31.268 --> 34:33.136
I just thought that
we stop pretending.

34:41.545 --> 34:42.645
I won't tell your dad.

35:00.831 --> 35:02.665
It's a bong, not a pipe.

35:06.637 --> 35:08.804
And it's some
pretty strong stuff.

35:08.905 --> 35:12.675
Well, let's fire it up.

35:12.776 --> 35:15.345
OK, don't be a dork, Mom.

35:15.446 --> 35:18.348
Right.

35:18.449 --> 35:19.815
Here, hold this.

35:20.184 --> 35:22.285
OK.

35:22.386 --> 35:23.453
We should probably go out here.

35:23.654 --> 35:26.289
Out there?

35:26.390 --> 35:27.823
Yeah, out here.

35:27.924 --> 35:28.191
OK.

35:47.311 --> 35:47.710
Exhale.

36:01.625 --> 36:04.727
[dog barking]

36:25.015 --> 36:25.248
Whoa.

36:30.020 --> 36:30.420
Whoa.

36:30.521 --> 36:31.354
What?

36:31.455 --> 36:33.022
BETTY: Did you see that?

36:33.123 --> 36:35.258
That bright-- it's
a purple streak.

36:37.794 --> 36:38.261
Mom.

36:40.864 --> 36:43.266
[laughter]

36:47.538 --> 36:48.504
What?

36:48.606 --> 36:51.774
[laughter]

36:59.149 --> 37:01.484
I applied.

37:01.585 --> 37:04.387
You were just
yanking his chain?

37:04.488 --> 37:05.288
[laughter]

37:05.389 --> 37:06.289
FINLEY: Few months ago.

37:11.762 --> 37:16.266
I applied to the Art
Institute in New York.

37:16.367 --> 37:18.301
New York?

37:18.402 --> 37:20.403
Like not the AG science?

37:20.504 --> 37:23.839
I showed one of the
professors my portfolio.

37:23.940 --> 37:31.614
BETTY: How-- your portfolio?

37:31.715 --> 37:32.815
My drawings.

37:36.720 --> 37:37.320
You want to go?

37:40.857 --> 37:42.292
If they want me.

37:54.538 --> 37:58.508
You only have to do one thing.

37:58.875 --> 38:01.277
What?

38:01.378 --> 38:02.345
Make yourself happy.

38:11.322 --> 38:14.357
[music playing]

38:44.655 --> 38:46.021
[men's voices in background]

38:46.122 --> 38:48.057
FRANK: If you could tell
me who it is that sells,

38:48.158 --> 38:49.559
so I can-- come on, Ed.

38:49.660 --> 38:51.160
Who is it?

38:51.261 --> 38:51.861
ED: I can't.

38:51.962 --> 38:53.529
You know that, Frank.

38:53.630 --> 38:54.797
I know, but--

38:54.898 --> 38:55.898
FRANK: You told us
that you could help--

38:58.669 --> 38:58.901
Morning.

39:03.173 --> 39:04.139
Well?

39:04.241 --> 39:06.642
An offer's been
made on the place.

39:06.744 --> 39:08.444
Well, we just made a payment.

39:08.545 --> 39:09.078
Ah--

39:09.179 --> 39:10.346
Frank?

39:10.447 --> 39:12.849
The bank has tried to
work with you on this,

39:12.949 --> 39:17.987
but we have an offer on
the property outright.

39:18.088 --> 39:20.723
We need the back
payments on the house.

39:20.957 --> 39:21.591
Morning, Finley.

39:21.692 --> 39:22.458
Mr. Kroger.

39:22.559 --> 39:23.092
Sam.

39:23.193 --> 39:24.059
Go on.

39:24.160 --> 39:26.095
Fin, get Sam in the truck.

39:26.196 --> 39:28.130
Go on.

39:28.231 --> 39:29.599
I'm sorry to catch
you with the boys.

39:29.900 --> 39:30.800
Oh, no.

39:30.901 --> 39:32.268
No-- no trouble at all, Ed.

39:32.369 --> 39:34.003
Well, we have a big
sale coming in, Ed.

39:34.104 --> 39:34.737
Right, Frank?

39:34.838 --> 39:35.405
That's right.

39:35.506 --> 39:37.039
Right.

39:37.140 --> 39:41.076
In order to retain ownership
of the property, we need it.

39:41.177 --> 39:42.745
Now.

39:42.846 --> 39:44.847
I can give you till
the end of the week.

39:44.948 --> 39:46.716
It's Gigas, isn't it?

39:46.817 --> 39:47.617
That man from Gigas?

39:47.718 --> 39:48.718
Yeah.

39:48.819 --> 39:50.720
I wish it were in my hands.

39:50.987 --> 39:51.454
Forgive me.

39:54.958 --> 39:55.458
Ed?

40:02.599 --> 40:03.466
Halloween's end of the week.

40:07.237 --> 40:08.638
How am I going to
finish the costume?

40:08.739 --> 40:10.105
Dad?

40:10.507 --> 40:12.141
Dad?

40:12.476 --> 40:15.144
Dad?

40:15.245 --> 40:15.978
Frank?

40:16.079 --> 40:17.547
Yeah, no, no, I'm all right.

40:17.648 --> 40:18.514
I'm all right.

40:18.615 --> 40:20.450
I'm all right.

40:20.551 --> 40:21.517
What happened?

40:21.618 --> 40:24.754
No, no, I just-- I
need to, uh-- I just

40:24.855 --> 40:26.489
need to close my
eyes for a moment.

40:43.273 --> 40:46.509
[grunts]

41:35.058 --> 41:35.558
How you feeling?

41:39.496 --> 41:40.563
Ah, I can't get comfortable.

41:44.067 --> 41:44.567
Need anything?

41:47.538 --> 41:49.639
Come to bed.

41:49.740 --> 41:50.573
I'm freezing.

42:06.456 --> 42:08.090
Sale to McKibbin
gonna be enough?

42:10.994 --> 42:12.595
I need to give him
a little more time.

42:15.699 --> 42:19.769
Uh-- Scratch has some
kind of problems with one

42:19.870 --> 42:21.336
of his dairy cows.

42:21.438 --> 42:23.105
I'll go see if I can wrangle
something over there tomorrow.

42:26.109 --> 42:27.577
I want you to get some rest.

42:39.022 --> 42:42.124
[cows mooing]

42:59.275 --> 43:02.177
BETTY: You've got to leave
them on increase, a hormone.

43:02.278 --> 43:03.613
SCRATCH: All of 'em?

43:03.714 --> 43:06.281
More productive but hell
of a lot less durable.

43:06.382 --> 43:07.850
BETTY: Fecal worm on this one.

43:07.951 --> 43:11.353
I've got an antibiotic that'll
get rid of this infection

43:11.454 --> 43:12.722
before you can say Jesus.

43:12.823 --> 43:15.124
My Gigas rep said I'd
send him to slaughter.

43:15.225 --> 43:16.391
Well, it hasn't gone systemic.

43:16.493 --> 43:19.394
He would only know
that by looking at her.

43:19.496 --> 43:21.163
You don't feel right,
but she'll be fine.

43:21.264 --> 43:23.165
Just make sure to keep
them separated, OK?

43:23.266 --> 43:26.368
The healthy from the sick.

43:26.469 --> 43:28.470
Everything they got goes
into making that milk.

43:28.571 --> 43:30.973
Well, Frank and I have a good
supply of that antibiotic.

43:31.074 --> 43:32.608
My rep will have
it out by Mon--

43:32.709 --> 43:34.276
I can have it to
you within the hour,

43:34.377 --> 43:36.679
not even charging you
to bring a vet out here.

43:36.780 --> 43:38.814
I can't afford to
lose any of my stock,

43:38.915 --> 43:42.018
but I can't lose my
contract with Gigas neither.

43:42.119 --> 43:43.585
BETTY: If you're
worried about money

43:43.687 --> 43:46.088
then you should stop your
increase injections for a time.

43:46.189 --> 43:47.422
It'll be a waste
because you're gonna

43:47.524 --> 43:48.724
have to throw this milk out.

43:48.825 --> 43:50.292
SCRATCH: No, my rep
didn't say anything--

43:50.393 --> 43:52.361
Well, they don't want you
throwing out your milk,

43:52.462 --> 43:53.663
even if it is tainted.

43:53.764 --> 43:55.131
Each day their treated
with an antibiotic,

43:55.231 --> 43:56.999
you need to discard your
milk for 36 hours.

43:57.100 --> 43:58.534
That's roughly 10
days worth of milk

43:58.635 --> 44:00.569
that you're going to
have to throw out.

44:00.671 --> 44:03.438
Probably some sort of
contamination in your lines,

44:03.540 --> 44:05.708
you're gonna have to clean
out all this equipment.

44:10.047 --> 44:12.815
But your supplier
can tell you that.

44:12.916 --> 44:15.417
I'll have some trucks out later
today to pick up your milk,

44:15.518 --> 44:16.652
shouldn't affect your output.

44:16.753 --> 44:18.387
BETTY: No one will
know, so why worry?

44:18.488 --> 44:21.390
We all have to be a little
bit flexible to keep working.

44:21.491 --> 44:23.826
Course, you wouldn't think
twice about taking that milk

44:23.927 --> 44:24.960
to market.

44:25.062 --> 44:26.228
SCRATCH: Let me
walk the lady out.

44:34.004 --> 44:35.771
Give me the sale, Scratch.

44:35.872 --> 44:38.273
I was here first and I
can get you that drug now.

44:38.374 --> 44:40.509
You know I can't do that.

44:40.610 --> 44:42.311
You're gonna unload
all this milk,

44:42.412 --> 44:45.081
I get 20 more loads like
this one going out today.

44:45.182 --> 44:48.250
He's not going to rest until my
boys are begging in the street.

44:58.962 --> 45:01.197
I got inspectors coming out.

45:01.297 --> 45:04.934
I came across some old
stuff in one of the barns.

45:05.035 --> 45:07.970
I need someone to dispose of it.

45:08.071 --> 45:09.271
I can't do it officially.

45:09.372 --> 45:11.273
You know how much it'd
put me in the hole.

45:14.244 --> 45:18.480
I need someone I
trust, someone I know.

45:18.581 --> 45:20.282
I can't have it
coming back on me.

45:27.157 --> 45:28.657
What is it?

45:28.759 --> 45:30.726
More than likely something you
and Frank sold me a while back.

45:30.827 --> 45:33.295
Same damn stuff we're
using right now,

45:33.396 --> 45:34.797
but an hour past
it's expiration.

45:37.634 --> 45:41.036
I can't afford any fines,
getting shut down even

45:41.138 --> 45:43.472
for a day.

45:43.573 --> 45:44.373
What?

45:44.474 --> 45:46.308
You got some kind of a problem?

45:46.409 --> 45:50.279
You sell this stuff, Betty.

45:50.380 --> 45:52.248
This is what you do.

45:52.348 --> 45:55.217
I mean, don't go getting
all knotted up about it.

45:55.318 --> 45:57.153
It all ends up in the
water table anyhow.

45:57.254 --> 45:59.121
Not by my hands.

45:59.222 --> 46:01.423
That's right.

46:01.524 --> 46:05.694
It was legal when
you sold it to me.

46:05.829 --> 46:08.130
I trust you, girl.

46:08.231 --> 46:10.966
The money is good.

46:11.067 --> 46:13.936
It's real good.

46:14.037 --> 46:20.342
Do me a favor and I can find
you some work, real work.

46:20.443 --> 46:23.345
Maybe we'll talk about
setting up regular shipments

46:23.446 --> 46:26.315
for the crop duster.

46:26.416 --> 46:27.349
Think about that.

47:04.054 --> 47:04.386
BETTY: Sam?

47:06.923 --> 47:07.389

48:42.718 --> 48:43.252

[speaking spanish]

48:45.021 --> 48:45.487
What happened?

48:45.588 --> 48:46.121
I don't know.

48:46.222 --> 48:47.222
OK.

48:47.324 --> 48:49.291
Come on, come on.

Sometimes, when she's playing,
she has trouble breathing.

48:53.096 --> 48:54.997
Can I help?

48:55.098 --> 48:55.998
OK, Elena.

48:58.634 --> 48:59.234
Get in the truck.

48:59.336 --> 49:00.502
Ow, Mom.

49:20.623 --> 49:21.523
What were you doing?

49:26.896 --> 49:29.531
You think that you can just take
off, go wherever you please?

49:52.688 --> 49:54.223
DOCTOR: I've looked
over the results.

49:54.324 --> 49:56.725
We have run all the tests.

49:56.826 --> 49:59.495
I know this is tough.

49:59.595 --> 50:01.497
There are standard
courses of treatment

50:01.597 --> 50:03.465
and there are newer
experimental ones

50:03.566 --> 50:05.401
that are primarily
hormone therapies

50:05.502 --> 50:06.768
that we can try on you.

50:06.869 --> 50:09.038
They tend to be well
tolerated, although there

50:09.139 --> 50:11.373
are side effects with either
type of treatment course

50:11.474 --> 50:12.774
you decide on.

50:12.875 --> 50:14.543
And there are other
medications I can put you

50:14.644 --> 50:16.178
on if the side
effects get to a point

50:16.279 --> 50:18.547
where they're causing
you too much discomfort.

50:18.648 --> 50:20.582
'Course, with either
treatment, there

50:20.683 --> 50:26.088
will be out of pocket
cost that you will--

50:36.032 --> 50:37.599
Why aren't you saying anything?

50:43.540 --> 50:44.839
Yeah, they took some blood.

50:44.941 --> 50:46.208
It's fine.

50:46.309 --> 50:50.446
And-- and the boys, we'll
just-- we'll just-- we'll

50:50.547 --> 50:51.780
have to be there for them.

50:51.881 --> 50:53.782
We will.

50:53.883 --> 50:55.850
We will.

50:55.952 --> 50:59.221
All right?

50:59.322 --> 51:01.623
Get someone, Frank.

51:05.595 --> 51:07.629
I can't do this alone.

51:10.900 --> 51:13.969
Doctor wants a few more tests.

51:14.070 --> 51:18.307
They'll come back clear anyway.

51:18.408 --> 51:19.341
It's a waste of money.

51:19.442 --> 51:20.142
Right, honey?

51:23.346 --> 51:26.215
We'll get those tests.

51:26.316 --> 51:27.149
We'll pay for 'em.

51:34.824 --> 51:38.494
Money comes in from
McKibbin, I'll do it then.

51:38.595 --> 51:39.394
I'll go see him tomorrow.

51:39.695 --> 51:41.597
Heh, no.

51:41.697 --> 51:42.697
I need to deal with him.

51:42.798 --> 51:44.166
Just give me a few days.

51:51.707 --> 51:52.307
What happened?

51:58.348 --> 51:59.681
Is it bleeding bad?

College?

52:25.508 --> 52:29.645
Don't tell Dad, please.

52:29.745 --> 52:34.550
I'm in awe of you, Fin.

52:34.651 --> 52:36.718
Even if I got a
scholarship, we'd still

52:36.819 --> 52:39.020
have to pay for something.

52:39.121 --> 52:40.222
We could never really afford it.

52:46.462 --> 52:48.363
I want this.

52:48.464 --> 52:50.765
Fin?

52:50.866 --> 52:51.733
I want this for you.

52:56.138 --> 52:59.708
I'll wait a year, see
if things get better.

52:59.809 --> 53:01.643
Another year's not going
to make a difference.

53:01.744 --> 53:03.245
BETTY: You can't stay here, Fin.

53:10.520 --> 53:11.253
I'll be OK.

53:43.620 --> 53:44.753
Hey, Betty.

53:44.854 --> 53:46.955
Hey, I see you're all
set for Halloween.

53:47.257 --> 53:48.490
Yeah.

53:48.591 --> 53:49.924
You know, you kind of caught
me in the middle of supper.

53:50.025 --> 53:51.092
I'm sorry about that.

53:51.193 --> 53:53.895
It's just, ah-- you
paid the deposit

53:53.996 --> 53:55.196
and I don't mean
to pressure you,

53:55.298 --> 53:59.968
but we need the
rest of the money.

54:00.069 --> 54:00.302
What?

54:03.038 --> 54:05.474
The balance on the
delivery system?

54:05.575 --> 54:07.542
That was a loan.

54:07.644 --> 54:10.779
You wrote Frank a
check, a deposit.

54:10.880 --> 54:15.116
I think you should talk
to your husband about this.

54:15.217 --> 54:18.453
I need the rest of the
money and then I can go.

54:18.554 --> 54:19.854
Look.

54:19.955 --> 54:21.490
I don't expect Frank's
ever going to pay me back,

54:21.591 --> 54:24.326
but I just can't
give you anymore.

54:24.427 --> 54:25.327
I'm not running a charity.

54:28.898 --> 54:29.831
Go home, Betty.

[door closing]

55:08.705 --> 55:11.873
[music playing]

55:34.597 --> 55:35.897
OK, put that in.

55:39.469 --> 55:42.136
Where's Frank?

55:42.438 --> 55:44.740
On a run.

55:44.841 --> 55:46.641
How are you gonna
manage on your own?

55:46.743 --> 55:49.378
He'll give me a hand later.

55:49.479 --> 55:52.914
Sure wish I had a black
briefcase to put that in.

55:53.015 --> 55:55.183
This band's just the same.

55:55.284 --> 55:57.919
You should wear
gloves, maybe a mask.

55:58.020 --> 55:59.087
Couldn't be that bad.

55:59.188 --> 56:00.221
Like you said,
it's probably stuff

56:00.322 --> 56:02.357
that you bought from us anyhow.

56:02.458 --> 56:07.729
It'll be fine, long
as it's diluted.

56:07.930 --> 56:10.064
'Course it will.

56:10.165 --> 56:12.768
Make sure you bring
those jugs back.

56:12.869 --> 56:13.935
That didn't come out right.

56:17.740 --> 56:19.408
This is half.

56:19.509 --> 56:21.410
The other half when you
bring the empties back.

56:21.511 --> 56:23.678
I got to make sure this comes
out right, you understand.

56:23.780 --> 56:31.780
No, you never said anything--
I need the money now, Scratch.

56:32.555 --> 56:33.588
All of it.

56:33.689 --> 56:36.691
You'll get your money.

56:36.793 --> 56:38.092
What about the
regular shipments?

56:38.193 --> 56:40.829
You do this job,
you do it right,

56:40.930 --> 56:45.199

where that came from.

Still fits.

58:32.008 --> 58:34.009
I'm not going as the same thing.

Well, you don't have to.

thing for Scratch.

(IN MONSTER VOICE) Put it
out of your mind, Betty.

59:02.605 --> 59:04.606
It's probably something
that we sold him.

Oh, remember these?

Come on, you always get
wild when you wear these.

59:27.697 --> 59:29.197
Put 'em on.

on, pussy, pussy, pussy.

Oh, come on.

We do this thing
right for Scratch,

59:56.058 --> 59:57.659
he's got more work for us.

01:00:04.934 --> 01:00:07.401
This isn't what we do.

01:00:07.503 --> 01:00:10.672
How're you gonna pay the bank?

01:00:10.773 --> 01:00:11.673
We'll find another way.

01:00:29.458 --> 01:00:33.928
I need you to open
your eyes, baby.

01:00:34.030 --> 01:00:37.598
We've got everything we need.
