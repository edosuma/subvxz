WEBVTT

00:11.846 --> 00:14.140
My name
is Marco Inaros.

00:14.140 --> 00:16.851
I am the Commander
of the Free Navy,

00:16.892 --> 00:18.936
and we are the ones
responsible

00:18.978 --> 00:20.604
- for striking our oppressors

00:20.646 --> 00:21.897
on Earth and Mars.

00:21.939 --> 00:24.066
Today and forevermore,

00:24.150 --> 00:25.735
we are free.

00:25.776 --> 00:27.653
All Belters will have to answer

00:27.695 --> 00:28.863
for Marco's deeds now.

00:28.904 --> 00:29.947
You know what happens

00:29.989 --> 00:31.365
when someone
goes against Marco.

00:31.407 --> 00:32.908
We'll be killed.

00:32.950 --> 00:35.327
You will intercept
and engage the Rocinante.

00:35.369 --> 00:37.204
Make sure it is done.

00:37.246 --> 00:38.622
- Don't even twitch.
-

00:40.082 --> 00:41.667
Why did you leave me?

00:41.709 --> 00:46.046
Walking away is the only
choice anyone ever has.

00:46.088 --> 00:47.798
She left us both.

00:47.840 --> 00:48.799
Again.

00:48.841 --> 00:50.801
Hang on, Naomi, we're coming.

00:50.843 --> 00:52.344
What is she doing?

00:54.221 --> 00:56.557
I've got her.
Alex, reply.

00:56.599 --> 00:59.727
It was a stroke.
It's a risk we all take.

00:59.769 --> 01:01.312
He died saving me.

01:01.353 --> 01:02.688
I'm so sorry.

01:02.730 --> 01:04.690
Making the choice
to save your family...

01:04.732 --> 01:07.067
as far as last stands go,
that's the one I'd pick.

01:07.109 --> 01:09.820
Did you come here
to help me?

01:09.862 --> 01:11.197
I guess I did.

01:11.238 --> 01:13.491
Peaches, come on up.

01:14.575 --> 01:17.328
There's been
another attack at the Ring.

01:18.454 --> 01:19.872
Marco, Marco!

01:19.914 --> 01:22.082
An entire fleet
of Martians gone rogue,

01:22.124 --> 01:23.417
in league with Inaros.

01:23.459 --> 01:25.336
He may have bought them

01:25.377 --> 01:26.629
with the protomolecule.

01:26.670 --> 01:27.963
Why would Martians

01:28.005 --> 01:29.799
take protomolecule
through the Ring

01:29.840 --> 01:31.801
after what it did on Ilus?

01:31.842 --> 01:35.095
Maybe they know
something we don't.

01:45.314 --> 01:46.607
Gruncher!

01:54.698 --> 01:55.908
Hm?

02:00.830 --> 02:02.748
Slinkervine!

02:09.171 --> 02:11.006
-
- Sunbird.

02:12.925 --> 02:14.802
Sun-babies!

02:19.765 --> 02:21.517
Ah!

02:37.908 --> 02:40.786
I'm gonna have to
give you all names.

02:40.828 --> 02:43.038
If I can figure out
how to tell you apart.

02:54.008 --> 02:56.302
Who's there?

02:56.343 --> 02:57.803
Xan?

02:57.845 --> 02:59.513
Is that you?

03:01.181 --> 03:02.725
It better not be.

03:02.766 --> 03:05.060
I told you
to stop following me.

03:11.817 --> 03:13.360
Hey.

03:13.402 --> 03:15.738
What are you?

03:16.822 --> 03:18.365
It's okay, it's okay.

03:18.407 --> 03:20.034
You can come out.

03:20.075 --> 03:22.661
I'm friendly, see?

03:30.794 --> 03:33.505
Are you a rock jumper?

03:33.547 --> 03:35.841
I don't think so.

03:35.883 --> 03:38.677
You look like a dog. Kinda.

03:51.023 --> 03:53.150
It's okay, it's okay!

03:54.693 --> 03:56.862
You're...you're gonna be okay!

06:18.879 --> 06:21.131
Marco, Marco, Marco!

06:24.718 --> 06:28.680
Marco, Marco, Marco, Marco!

06:45.239 --> 06:47.825
Now Earthers know
what it feels like

06:47.866 --> 06:49.535
to be Belter.

07:13.183 --> 07:14.685
MCRN Denali

07:14.726 --> 07:16.562
linked tracking with
UNN Farragut,

07:16.603 --> 07:18.730
and in conjunction
with Sentinel-16,

07:18.772 --> 07:19.940
the combined railgun barrage

07:19.982 --> 07:22.109
destroyed the three
incoming rocks.

07:22.151 --> 07:24.236
I used to like
shooting stars.

07:24.278 --> 07:25.946
I never did.

07:25.988 --> 07:28.240
Secondary impacts?

07:30.284 --> 07:33.620
Four significant fragments
made it to ground,

07:33.662 --> 07:36.415
two striking
populated areas.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.250
Total casualties
under 500.

07:38.292 --> 07:40.711
Don't try to make it
sound like a success.

07:40.752 --> 07:43.755
Well, I-I wasn't, ma'am,
but we have knocked down

07:43.797 --> 07:46.300
nearly every rock Marco Inaros
has thrown at us

07:46.341 --> 07:47.509
for the last six months.

07:47.551 --> 07:49.303
That's 200
individual strikes.

07:49.344 --> 07:51.763
And he has kept
what's left of our fleet

07:51.805 --> 07:53.974
pinned down doing it,

07:54.016 --> 07:57.895
while he makes every station
and rock hopper in the Belt

07:57.936 --> 08:00.564
pledge allegiance
to his so-called

08:00.606 --> 08:02.065
fucking Free Navy.

08:02.107 --> 08:03.734
Mars has assured us
there will be

08:03.775 --> 08:06.069
one more Donnager class
operational within the month.

08:06.111 --> 08:07.571
And we'll have three
more battleships

08:07.613 --> 08:09.323
ready for deployment
by year's end.

08:09.364 --> 08:12.117
The yards are working
around the clock.

08:26.965 --> 08:30.135
It's like a goddamn
nuclear winter.

08:31.428 --> 08:35.015
Have you read the latest
biospheric assessment?

08:35.057 --> 08:36.475
Not yet.

08:36.516 --> 08:39.811
Repurposing our atmospheric CO2 scrubbers

08:39.853 --> 08:41.230
isn't working.

08:41.271 --> 08:42.981
Not well enough.

08:43.023 --> 08:47.069
Meteoric contaminants
are still rising,

08:47.110 --> 08:50.155
even faster than before.

08:50.197 --> 08:53.242
Every rock kills us
a little more,

08:53.283 --> 08:55.869
even when they miss.

08:56.536 --> 09:00.457
I gave a speech at
that facility when it opened

09:00.499 --> 09:03.210
eleven years ago,
almost to the day.

09:03.252 --> 09:06.505
I toured those fields.

09:06.546 --> 09:09.925
The corn was ready to harvest.

09:09.967 --> 09:13.679
The stalks
were so heavy they bent.

09:36.368 --> 09:37.703
Where the fuck
did that come from?

09:37.744 --> 09:40.706
I don't know...they must be
hugging one of the rocks!

09:40.747 --> 09:43.041
PDC3 is jammed!

09:43.083 --> 09:46.044
PDC5 is also red, power out!

09:51.800 --> 09:53.885
Scratch one.

09:53.927 --> 09:55.429
I see them.

09:55.470 --> 09:57.389
- They're running!
- Firing one.

10:23.749 --> 10:25.959
Well, I guess
that confirms the rumors

10:26.001 --> 10:27.919
of Free Navy activity
in this area.

10:34.718 --> 10:36.845
Sweeping 360.

10:41.224 --> 10:43.310
Do you think
I could convince Chrissy

10:43.352 --> 10:45.687
to pay us for every one
of these assholes we take out?

10:45.729 --> 10:47.230
I'd like to see you try.

10:47.272 --> 10:48.774
I'm serious.

10:51.234 --> 10:52.778
We're not mercenaries.

10:52.819 --> 10:55.030
And we're not soldiers either.

10:56.823 --> 10:59.701
Looks like they were
out here alone.

10:59.743 --> 11:02.496
Okay. So the question is

11:02.537 --> 11:04.831
why were they here
in the first place?

11:07.667 --> 11:09.002
No way a little skiff like that

11:09.044 --> 11:10.962
could have launched
rocks this big.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.132
I'm gonna take us in
for a closer look.

11:14.174 --> 11:17.135
No, we should
keep our distance.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.888
The Free Navy loves improvised
bombs and proximity triggers.

11:19.930 --> 11:21.640
They know it gets Marco off.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.392
I'll send in a drone.

11:23.433 --> 11:26.978
Shrapnel took out
a whole camera.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.772
Guess I'm gonna
have to go out there

11:28.814 --> 11:31.149
and see if we got
any holes that need plugging.

11:33.068 --> 11:34.486
All right.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.906
Peaches, you still alive?

11:37.948 --> 11:39.491
If you call this living.

11:39.533 --> 11:42.160
You catch
that power out on PDC5?

11:42.202 --> 11:43.912
- Uh-huh.
It looked to me like...

11:43.954 --> 11:45.414
Like a series of
transient spikes

11:45.455 --> 11:47.541
tripped the surge protectors?

11:47.582 --> 11:50.627
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

11:50.669 --> 11:52.838
That's what I thought too.

11:52.879 --> 11:54.798
Make sure you reset
the master bus

11:54.840 --> 11:56.466
before you start
the diagnostic.

11:56.508 --> 11:58.260
Come on, that's S.O.P.

11:58.301 --> 12:01.138
You should have more faith
in me than that.

12:01.179 --> 12:03.765
You know I do.
- I do.

12:03.807 --> 12:05.434
Amos, we're sending the drone

12:05.475 --> 12:07.686
to recon the rocks,
so watch your step out there.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.312
Roger that, cap'n.

12:09.354 --> 12:11.064
And Amos,
try to salvage the optics

12:11.106 --> 12:12.482
on that hull cam if you can.

12:12.524 --> 12:14.359
- We're out of spares.
All right.

12:14.401 --> 12:17.028
So Peaches, you got a plan?

12:17.070 --> 12:19.448
It's gotta be that twitchy
power coupling on the mains

12:19.489 --> 12:21.074
that keeps pissing us off.

12:21.116 --> 12:22.784
I'm on it.

12:22.826 --> 12:24.244
Good.

13:39.694 --> 13:42.405
No signs
of stealth composites.

13:42.447 --> 13:44.074
Good.

13:44.115 --> 13:46.451
Earth hasn't seen
a stealth rock in months.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.078
No pun intended.

13:48.119 --> 13:50.247
Be nice if it stayed...

13:55.418 --> 13:57.504
Goddamn it, there's
another ship down there.

13:57.546 --> 13:59.005
Hang on!

14:02.425 --> 14:04.553
I don't think
that is a ship.

14:04.594 --> 14:06.763
It's a drive.

15:16.458 --> 15:17.542
So far

15:17.584 --> 15:19.127
my projections have been
right on track.

15:19.169 --> 15:20.545
The flow of colony ships

15:20.587 --> 15:23.673
and all agricultural supplies
from Earthers stopped.

15:23.715 --> 15:26.092
They're too busy trying
to knock down our rocks.

15:26.134 --> 15:27.802
Yes, which gives us
a perfect opportunity

15:27.844 --> 15:29.304
to build up our own supplies.

15:29.346 --> 15:30.972
With the combination
of hydroponics

15:31.014 --> 15:32.474
and live soil farming,

15:32.515 --> 15:35.101
we should be able to increase
food production on Ceres

15:35.143 --> 15:37.520
by 15% to 20%
in the first year alone.

15:37.562 --> 15:39.439
- Dawes always said...
Dawes is dead

15:39.481 --> 15:40.940
because I got tired
of listening

15:40.982 --> 15:42.275
to what he had to say.

15:42.317 --> 15:44.527
And Fred Johnson is dead.

15:44.569 --> 15:48.406
Both of them, and all
their failures swept away.

15:48.448 --> 15:51.576
History has moved on,
and so shall we.

15:54.204 --> 15:56.373
Nice of you to join us.

15:56.414 --> 15:58.875
Nico Sanjrani,
Station Chief Administrator,

15:58.917 --> 16:01.127
- my son, Filip.
- It's a pleasure.

16:01.169 --> 16:03.338
Did I miss much?

16:03.380 --> 16:05.757
As much as usual.

16:05.799 --> 16:07.634
The last
report from Ganymede

16:07.676 --> 16:10.178
- said crop yields were up.
Yes, but Ganymede

16:10.220 --> 16:12.055
cannot be our only
source of food.

16:12.097 --> 16:13.890
We have to build
new ag stations

16:13.932 --> 16:15.100
and farms throughout the Belt.

16:15.141 --> 16:16.935
We must expand
water purification...

16:16.976 --> 16:19.187
You want something?

16:19.229 --> 16:21.231
- I do.
- I mean to drink.

16:21.272 --> 16:23.149
That's not all you mean.

16:23.191 --> 16:24.859
Let me know
if you change your mind.

16:24.901 --> 16:26.236
Let supplies
dwindle at the current pace,

16:26.277 --> 16:29.072
and new production is not
brought online immediately,

16:29.114 --> 16:32.909
our people are going to starve,
sooner, not later.

16:32.951 --> 16:34.619
Get a list.

16:38.957 --> 16:40.417
Good news.

16:40.458 --> 16:42.502
The Solano has taken
the last Dos Arrigas ship

16:42.544 --> 16:44.295
and spaced the crew.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.423
And the Panshin is tracking
two drive signatures

16:46.464 --> 16:48.258
which could be the last
Golden Bough dissidents.

16:48.299 --> 16:50.009
Is that a backhanded
way of saying

16:50.051 --> 16:51.886
that you still don't have
any news about Drummer?

16:51.928 --> 16:54.973
Do you want me to tell you
every time nothing happens?

16:55.014 --> 16:56.808
We've had a few
scattered reports,

16:56.850 --> 16:59.185
but none of them panned out.
We could up the bounty.

16:59.227 --> 17:00.937
More money?
That the best you can do?

17:00.979 --> 17:03.314
Increase the bounty
on Drummer 20%.

17:03.356 --> 17:06.359
And the Rocinante as well.

17:06.401 --> 17:08.236
Rosenfeld, with me.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.453
Hey, late to a meeting
with the bosmang?

17:16.494 --> 17:18.538
- That's a power move.
- I got lost on the way.

17:18.580 --> 17:20.165
Ah, what was her name?

17:20.206 --> 17:22.000
- I'm not sure.
- Ah...

17:22.041 --> 17:23.126
What's all this?

17:23.168 --> 17:25.003
Ah, alligator skin.
You like?

17:25.044 --> 17:27.338
- An animal?
- Eh, it's very expensive.

17:27.380 --> 17:29.674
Shopkeeper gave me a bargain,
to honor the cause, huh?

17:29.716 --> 17:31.634
He stole your money, copain.

17:31.676 --> 17:33.762
It's fake, synthetic.
Has to be.

17:33.803 --> 17:35.513
Pashang,
what do you know, huh?

17:35.555 --> 17:36.514
Earth is dying.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.016
We kill it,
it's not coming back.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.142
Real things like this

17:39.184 --> 17:40.769
or all the things
Inyalowda make before

17:40.810 --> 17:42.562
to sell and get rich and fat...
soon there won't be

17:42.604 --> 17:44.397
- any more of this.
Yoan, we on for later?

17:44.439 --> 17:45.690
Oh, yeah, you bet.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.901
See, you may have no taste,
but they do.

17:47.942 --> 17:50.195
They tell me they're thinking
to join the Free Navy.

17:50.236 --> 17:52.363
I tell them we can arrange
for a tour of the Pella.

17:54.157 --> 17:57.619
Marco, Marco, Marco!

17:57.660 --> 18:01.164
Marco! Marco! Marco!

18:01.206 --> 18:05.710
Marco, Marco, Marco, Marco!

18:05.752 --> 18:09.881
Marco, Marco,
Marco, Marco!

18:09.923 --> 18:12.967
Marco, Marco, Marco!

18:13.009 --> 18:17.680
It has been many years
since I set foot on Ceres.

18:17.722 --> 18:19.599
But I have always considered

18:19.641 --> 18:22.894
this station to be a home.

18:22.936 --> 18:26.314
To me and to
every other Belter.

18:26.356 --> 18:29.651
The Inners may have
thought it was theirs,

18:29.692 --> 18:33.196
but it was always ours.

18:33.238 --> 18:37.492
We forged our identities here.

18:37.534 --> 18:40.620
And now we will turn it
into the jewel

18:40.662 --> 18:43.665
it was always meant to be!

18:46.751 --> 18:52.924
Ceres will be the capital city
of our Belter Nation.

18:52.966 --> 18:57.387
A place all Belters
can be proud of

18:57.428 --> 19:00.557
and forever call home!

19:02.684 --> 19:06.855
Marco, Marco, Marco, Marco!

19:06.896 --> 19:10.608
Marco, Marco,
Marco, Marco!

19:41.723 --> 19:43.099
Attention, DeWalt.

19:43.141 --> 19:45.184
This is the
Free Navy hunter Jotunn.

19:45.226 --> 19:47.395
Prepare to be boarded.

19:47.437 --> 19:49.480
Tynan, we know you here also.

19:49.522 --> 19:52.942
Show and declare yourself
or be destroyed.

19:55.236 --> 19:57.530
DeWalt remote link open.

19:57.572 --> 20:00.033
Thrusters standing by.

20:17.675 --> 20:19.302
- Take the shot.
Not yet.

20:19.344 --> 20:22.597
It's a direct fire weapon.
It has to line up perfectly.

20:25.683 --> 20:28.561
On my signal.

20:28.603 --> 20:31.606
Port thruster, ten degree yaw.

20:31.648 --> 20:32.607
Michio!

20:32.649 --> 20:34.275
Ah...

20:34.317 --> 20:36.277
On your signal.

20:46.829 --> 20:48.373
- Now!
- Ah!

20:51.000 --> 20:52.335
-
- What did you do?

20:52.377 --> 20:53.920
I...

21:02.387 --> 21:04.097
They're locking in
on our transmitter.

21:04.138 --> 21:05.974
Changing course.
Heading right for us.

21:06.015 --> 21:07.141
Pashang!

21:07.183 --> 21:09.185
I'm... I'm sorry!

21:31.374 --> 21:33.876
No pursuit.
We got 'im.

21:40.591 --> 21:42.719
What were we able
to get off the DeWalt?

21:44.095 --> 21:45.596
Moving the crew over
was the first priority.

21:45.638 --> 21:47.015
I know that.

21:47.056 --> 21:48.641
We transferred
most of the fuel.

21:48.683 --> 21:50.685
One tank of water,
two pellets of ration.

21:50.727 --> 21:52.395
Munitions?

21:54.605 --> 21:56.065
One torpedo.

21:58.109 --> 22:01.654
Which brings our missile load
to a grand total of three.

22:04.157 --> 22:06.159
At least we killed 'em.

22:40.902 --> 22:44.030
Simple,
quick, and dirty.

22:44.072 --> 22:47.575
Any rock hopper with a standard
mining kit could do this.

22:47.617 --> 22:49.410
If they were willing
to waste an engine.

22:49.452 --> 22:51.746
But given the number
of colony ships

22:51.788 --> 22:53.206
the Free Navy's plundered...

22:53.247 --> 22:55.291
There's bound to be
a lot more of these.

22:57.418 --> 23:00.713
We have to figure out
how they're being triggered.

23:00.755 --> 23:02.298
If we could stop
even a few of 'em

23:02.340 --> 23:05.134
before they're launched,
it'll be an accomplishment.

23:05.176 --> 23:06.969
The trigger module
will probably be

23:07.011 --> 23:08.513
with the guidance system,

23:08.554 --> 23:10.556
which would've been an add-on
to a set-up like this,

23:10.598 --> 23:13.601
so look for a box
wired directly to the reactor

23:13.643 --> 23:16.813
either with
or without an antenna.

23:16.854 --> 23:18.773
I think I see it.

23:37.875 --> 23:39.794
Thank you.

23:47.009 --> 23:49.262
The customary response

23:49.303 --> 23:51.264
is "you're welcome."

23:51.305 --> 23:52.807
Sorry.

23:54.934 --> 23:56.310
I just realized this is

23:56.352 --> 23:58.813
the first time
I've flown the Roci.

24:01.858 --> 24:04.694
First time I ever had to.

24:07.488 --> 24:09.907
I know what that feels like.

24:20.793 --> 24:23.546
Yeah, that's
the navigation computer.

24:23.588 --> 24:25.840
I see the diagnostic port.

24:25.882 --> 24:27.508
You'll have to cable in
and see if you can access

24:27.550 --> 24:31.012
reactor controls or a nav log.

24:31.053 --> 24:32.847
Copy that.

24:45.776 --> 24:50.990
Uh, uh, Naomi?

24:51.032 --> 24:52.408
Holden, what's going on?

24:52.450 --> 24:54.952
I think the magnetic bottle's
cycling up.

24:55.703 --> 24:56.913
You've started the reactor.

24:56.954 --> 24:58.247
I must have
tripped the failsafe.

24:58.289 --> 25:01.542
No, you need to
get out of there!

25:07.632 --> 25:09.550
Jim, what the fuck
are you doing!?

25:09.592 --> 25:12.553
You need to get
out of there now!

25:12.595 --> 25:14.722
Get behind the ridge first
and I'll drop between you

25:14.764 --> 25:16.224
and the drive cone if you can.

25:16.265 --> 25:18.684
Jim, I can put the Roci down.

25:20.478 --> 25:22.355
Jim! God damn it!

25:22.396 --> 25:25.650
You have to get out of there!
You have to move!

25:26.525 --> 25:29.195
Jim, you have to get
out of there now!

25:30.571 --> 25:31.489
Jim!

25:32.156 --> 25:34.158
Jim, talk to me, goddamn it!

25:35.701 --> 25:37.119
Jim!

25:37.161 --> 25:39.497
Oh, you fucking piece of shit!

25:39.538 --> 25:41.540
Fuck!

26:02.353 --> 26:05.481
There wasn't enough time
to get far enough away.

26:05.523 --> 26:08.609
And I was sure if I could
break it, shut it down...

26:08.651 --> 26:11.070
Just come back inside, please.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.165
So long story short,

26:23.207 --> 26:25.001
the power coupling
is back in spec.

26:25.042 --> 26:26.711
Good work.

26:26.752 --> 26:28.671
Good teacher.

26:36.137 --> 26:37.930
You hurt yourself?

26:37.972 --> 26:39.682
Poor upbringing.

26:39.724 --> 26:42.435
Wasn't raised
to tension wrenches.

26:47.398 --> 26:49.358
I'm gonna go grab a bite.

26:51.444 --> 26:53.612
Sounds good,
I'll be there in a minute.

27:02.288 --> 27:05.249
Is there something you need
Peaches to do differently?

27:05.291 --> 27:08.085
I don't really care
what she does.

27:08.127 --> 27:10.171
You've been flying together
for months now.

27:10.212 --> 27:11.756
She's been working
her ass off.

27:11.797 --> 27:14.300
The only reason she's here
is because you decided

27:14.342 --> 27:17.303
to make her part of the crew.

27:17.345 --> 27:19.889
As if that could replace Alex.

27:25.853 --> 27:28.939
This has nothing
to do with Alex.

27:28.981 --> 27:31.359
And you know, you made
some pretty big decisions

27:31.400 --> 27:33.361
for all of us
without talking to me.

27:33.402 --> 27:36.614
Oh, so does that mean you can
do whatever you like now?

27:36.655 --> 27:38.532
I'm not saying that.

27:38.574 --> 27:41.827
But maybe you could cut
Peaches a fucking break,

27:41.869 --> 27:44.580
like we all did for you.

27:44.622 --> 27:47.041
You should find
somewhere else to be.

27:52.797 --> 27:55.091
You're right about that.

28:06.894 --> 28:08.813
We could try for Iapetus.

28:08.854 --> 28:10.898
We would never
get there unnoticed.

28:13.734 --> 28:16.821
There is the science
station on Triton.

28:16.862 --> 28:18.989
Fewer eyes along the way.

28:19.031 --> 28:21.033
That's a long way to go.

28:21.075 --> 28:22.785
We need to refuel.

28:22.827 --> 28:25.413
We need to re-arm.

28:25.454 --> 28:28.082
We gonna talk about
the other problem?

28:28.124 --> 28:30.292
Michio is not a problem.

28:30.334 --> 28:32.378
She made a mistake.

28:32.420 --> 28:35.089
- We all have.
- This one cost us a ship.

28:35.131 --> 28:37.091
It's not her first mistake.

28:37.133 --> 28:40.469
- She hasn't been sleeping.
- She isn't built for this.

28:40.511 --> 28:42.471
She's a salvage technician.

28:42.513 --> 28:45.015
- So are you.
- Not anymore.

28:45.057 --> 28:47.810
I'm a fighter now.

28:47.852 --> 28:49.854
What you always were.

28:54.817 --> 28:57.361
This is not a place
for her anymore.

28:57.403 --> 29:00.281
Michio is family.

29:07.580 --> 29:10.583
We have lost so much already.

29:16.964 --> 29:19.175
You are my captain.

29:19.216 --> 29:22.553
Whatever you choose,
I choose also.

29:32.563 --> 29:33.814
These can be shared.

29:33.856 --> 29:36.066
A little crowded, maybe,
but we will make do.

29:36.108 --> 29:38.402
Give us a moment, please.

29:38.444 --> 29:40.196
Aye, captain.

29:48.787 --> 29:51.290
I will do better, I promise.
I try harder.

29:51.332 --> 29:54.251
You are trying your best.
No one questions that.

29:55.920 --> 29:57.880
I don't know what to say
except I'm sorry.

29:57.922 --> 29:59.256
I am sorry too.

30:01.133 --> 30:05.596
We will find a safe port
where we can resupply.

30:05.638 --> 30:07.556
A place where you can stay.

30:07.598 --> 30:09.975
I don't want to leave you.

30:10.017 --> 30:11.685
It isn't forever.

30:11.727 --> 30:13.854
When this is all over, we will

30:13.896 --> 30:17.233
come back and find you.

30:17.274 --> 30:19.902
When it is over?

30:45.553 --> 30:47.763
Just give me a peek.

30:47.805 --> 30:50.766
I just want a picture to go
with the words, that's all.

30:50.808 --> 30:52.476
Really, that's all you want?

30:52.518 --> 30:53.602
- No.
-

30:53.644 --> 30:55.312
But hey,

30:55.354 --> 30:57.189
how 'bout I show you mine,
you should me yours?

30:57.231 --> 30:58.315
- Mm.
- Deal?

30:58.357 --> 30:59.692
Mm-hmm.

31:02.319 --> 31:03.779
That one?

31:03.821 --> 31:05.406
Ah, it's the Waxing Gibbous.

31:05.447 --> 31:07.074
Fat, fat
Earther colony ship.

31:07.116 --> 31:08.826
Soil, fertilizers,

31:08.867 --> 31:10.160
but best of all,

31:10.202 --> 31:12.371
30 bottles of fine
Irkutsk brandy.

31:12.413 --> 31:13.956
Oh! You ever
had brandy?

31:13.998 --> 31:15.541
No, what is it?

31:15.583 --> 31:17.418
It's a drink made
for the darkness.

31:17.459 --> 31:18.961
Goddamn Inyalowda,
they don't deserve it.

31:19.003 --> 31:21.088
- Do you have any?
- Yoan probably drank his share

31:21.130 --> 31:22.673
before they emptied that ship.

31:22.715 --> 31:24.633
Shortly after.

31:26.594 --> 31:28.012
And that one?

31:28.053 --> 31:30.306
It's the Ring Gate,
Medina Station.

31:30.347 --> 31:31.974
It's one of
our greatest triumphs.

31:32.016 --> 31:33.684
The Martians, they were
so happy to see us.

31:33.726 --> 31:35.269
Until they weren't.

31:37.354 --> 31:39.231
See, Filip, he was
the gun on the Pella.

31:39.273 --> 31:40.274
Me, I was gun
on the Connaught.

31:40.316 --> 31:41.442
He was gunner's mate.

31:41.483 --> 31:43.986
Filipito thinks
he's funny now, huh?

31:44.028 --> 31:45.779
Were you part
of the attacks on Earth?

31:45.821 --> 31:48.282
Me?
No, not so lucky, no.

31:48.324 --> 31:49.825
But he was.

31:49.867 --> 31:52.244
You were?

31:52.286 --> 31:54.079
Hey, don't be so modest.

31:54.121 --> 31:56.248
Filip, he was
the tip of the spear.

31:56.290 --> 31:58.292
Took stealth composite
right off Mars itself,

31:58.334 --> 32:00.336
right under the noses
of the Dusters.

32:00.377 --> 32:01.920
He killed
a science ship near Venus

32:01.962 --> 32:03.797
before they could
spoil the plan.

32:03.839 --> 32:05.799
Put Ashford the Ghost Knife
out the door

32:05.841 --> 32:08.677
and dropped the rocks to get
revenge for all of us, ah?

32:09.553 --> 32:11.680
He made
the Inyalowda burn.

32:12.723 --> 32:14.725
All that, and even

32:14.767 --> 32:17.436
better-looking than his father.

32:32.368 --> 32:33.952
Hey, Filip.

32:33.994 --> 32:35.871
Where you going, coyo?

32:54.765 --> 32:56.433
It's just coffee.

32:56.475 --> 32:58.102
Sorry.

32:59.061 --> 33:01.814
I could use something
to keep me awake.

33:05.901 --> 33:07.277
Thanks.

33:08.320 --> 33:11.156
The Inner Fleets
haven't even budged.

33:11.198 --> 33:13.617
That was your plan.

33:13.659 --> 33:16.161
You miss the fight.

33:16.203 --> 33:18.747
Don't you?

33:18.789 --> 33:21.500
The fight will come
soon enough.

33:21.542 --> 33:23.252
It always does.

33:23.293 --> 33:25.295
In the meantime...

33:25.337 --> 33:27.172
Sandrani's
fucking spreadsheets.

33:27.214 --> 33:28.549
All right.

33:28.590 --> 33:30.718
What can we spare
from the supply depots?

33:30.759 --> 33:32.636
Nothing.

33:32.678 --> 33:34.555
Ceres is not Medina.

33:34.596 --> 33:36.098
If Sandrani wants
more for the station,

33:36.140 --> 33:40.269
they can tighten the food
and water rations.

33:40.310 --> 33:41.645
Our presence on Ceres

33:41.687 --> 33:45.107
has rallied countless
Belters to the cause.

33:45.149 --> 33:47.025
Then it's served its purpose.

33:47.067 --> 33:49.820
We owe these people
nothing.

33:49.862 --> 33:52.197
Ceres is our capital.
These are our people.

33:52.239 --> 33:54.950
Your job is to get them
what they need.

33:54.992 --> 33:59.496
If you have any specific
logistical suggestions,

33:59.538 --> 34:01.582
we'd love to hear them.

34:04.626 --> 34:07.671
No, just...just do the job.

34:09.965 --> 34:12.259
We should discuss this further.

34:12.301 --> 34:15.304
I would like to...
In private.

34:15.345 --> 34:16.805
Medina needs
more titanium.

34:16.847 --> 34:17.806
A lot more.

34:17.848 --> 34:19.224
The Laconian pieces
have been harder

34:19.266 --> 34:20.684
to install than expected,

34:20.726 --> 34:22.936
and we need to reinforce
the abutments.

34:22.978 --> 34:24.980
Give them whatever they need.

34:31.320 --> 34:33.197
Charges set.

34:33.238 --> 34:35.574
Detonators at your discretion.

34:38.619 --> 34:41.121
- Something up?
- Possibly.

34:41.163 --> 34:44.708
Another intel update
on Free Navy assets came in.

34:44.750 --> 34:46.835
Just going through it,
and I saw this.

34:46.877 --> 34:48.754
That's one of the rogue
MCRN gunships

34:48.796 --> 34:52.716
that finished off
our fleet at the Ring.

34:52.758 --> 34:53.675
There.

34:53.717 --> 34:55.886
See those flashes?

34:55.928 --> 34:59.181
They remind you
of anything?

34:59.223 --> 35:02.017
They reminded me
of the artifact on Ilus.

35:02.059 --> 35:05.187
The thing that wiped out
the protomolecule builders.

35:05.229 --> 35:07.231
It's not
our problem anymore.

35:07.272 --> 35:09.650
Well, in the big picture,
it could be.

35:09.691 --> 35:13.111
The only reason the Rings
are here is because of us.

35:13.153 --> 35:14.696
I am out here

35:14.738 --> 35:17.115
to kill Marco
before he kills us.

35:17.157 --> 35:18.617
The only reason
that I'm still out here

35:18.659 --> 35:21.036
instead of drinking
myself blind on Luna

35:21.078 --> 35:23.997
is because
I don't want to abandon you.

35:24.039 --> 35:25.666
So don't abandon us.

35:25.707 --> 35:27.376
Hey.

35:27.417 --> 35:29.044
What's wrong?

35:29.086 --> 35:31.964
I found something.

35:32.005 --> 35:34.091
The guidance system
was set to launch the rock

35:34.132 --> 35:36.134
upon receiving
a single burst transmission

35:36.176 --> 35:38.053
at a specific frequency.

35:38.095 --> 35:40.764
It was coded, of course,
but it gave me an idea.

35:42.599 --> 35:45.269
I polled as many signal relays
in the Belt as I could,

35:45.310 --> 35:47.396
looking for coded bursts
at that frequency

35:47.437 --> 35:50.148
over the past few months.

35:50.190 --> 35:52.234
Found a bunch of them.

35:53.777 --> 35:55.779
Each of these signals
launched a rock.

35:55.821 --> 35:57.197
Which gave me another idea.

35:57.239 --> 35:59.449
I triangulated the signals
to see if I could find out

35:59.491 --> 36:01.702
where the transmission
came from.

36:02.786 --> 36:04.496
That looks like an orbit.

36:04.538 --> 36:08.208
Probably a spotter ship
that's been guiding the rocks.

36:10.794 --> 36:13.171
They'd have to be running dark.

36:13.213 --> 36:15.424
Passive sensors only.

36:15.465 --> 36:17.301
Quietly watching
Earth's defenses

36:17.342 --> 36:19.803
and timing them
to keep them pinned down.

36:19.845 --> 36:22.639
There were several references
in the guidance logs to...

36:22.681 --> 36:25.350
an Azure Dragon.

36:25.392 --> 36:27.561
I think
that's the name of the ship.

36:27.603 --> 36:31.106
Spotters like these
are highly specialized ships.

36:31.148 --> 36:33.525
There can't be that
many of them in operation.

36:36.612 --> 36:38.572
If we could find it

36:38.614 --> 36:40.657
and take it out,
it could seriously reduce

36:40.699 --> 36:43.368
Marco's ability
to keep hitting Earth.

36:45.996 --> 36:47.789
Prepare to get underway.

36:47.831 --> 36:50.125
Aye-aye, Captain.

36:53.170 --> 36:55.130
Naomi.

36:59.801 --> 37:01.720
I think sometimes
I convince myself

37:01.762 --> 37:04.181
the worst can't happen.

37:04.222 --> 37:06.224
It's a way for me
to get through things.

37:06.266 --> 37:09.519
I'll be more careful.
For all of us. I promise.

37:09.561 --> 37:12.814
And we're not going to stop.

37:15.817 --> 37:18.278
I tried for so long
to stay away from the violence,

37:18.320 --> 37:21.490
but... Marco pulled me
back into it.

37:21.531 --> 37:24.493
And now the people
we're hunting and killing

37:24.534 --> 37:27.579
are the same ones
I used to call my own.

37:30.415 --> 37:34.002
I don't know how much longer
I can bear it.

37:50.143 --> 37:52.187
Madame Secretary, do you
believe the MCR Commission...

37:52.229 --> 37:53.855
Madame Secretary, any comments

37:53.897 --> 37:55.065
on the food rioting
in Kinshasa?

37:55.107 --> 37:57.025
Not now, please.
The communications director

37:57.067 --> 37:58.568
will be scheduling
a conference shortly.

37:58.610 --> 37:59.903
Madame, is it true
you reached out to Marco Inaros

37:59.945 --> 38:03.198
to discuss a peace treaty?

38:03.240 --> 38:05.200
Because that's what
I've been hearing.

38:05.242 --> 38:08.245
The only thing Marco Inaros
has to offer me

38:08.286 --> 38:10.038
is his unconditional surrender.

38:10.080 --> 38:12.457
The colonies have been
incommunicado

38:12.499 --> 38:14.376
and at the mercy
of the Free Navy

38:14.418 --> 38:17.170
since Inaros wiped out
our forces at the Ring.

38:17.212 --> 38:19.089
He could be starving
the settlers out

38:19.131 --> 38:21.091
or using them
as forced labor to...

38:21.133 --> 38:23.135
That's why
we're at war with him.

38:23.176 --> 38:26.138
Has anybody in your cabinet
proposed negotiations?

38:26.179 --> 38:29.182
The deliberations of
my cabinet in a time of war

38:29.224 --> 38:31.059
are a matter
of national security

38:31.101 --> 38:33.020
and none of
your fucking business.

38:33.061 --> 38:35.063
Madame Secretary General,

38:35.105 --> 38:37.691
the people of this planet
have been through hell,

38:37.733 --> 38:38.859
and it's only getting worse.

38:38.900 --> 38:40.485
They're just looking
for honest answers.

38:40.527 --> 38:43.071
You owe them that.

38:44.781 --> 38:47.492
In case that wasn't clear
enough, we're done here.

38:47.534 --> 38:48.910
You know, Sergeant,
if you want my advice...

38:48.952 --> 38:50.495
- I don't.
- You should try to impress

38:50.537 --> 38:51.705
upon your boss the fact that

38:51.747 --> 38:53.957
she has constituents,
not subjects.

38:53.999 --> 38:57.377
She's aware
of the distinction.

38:58.420 --> 39:00.547
The one thing
I always liked about you

39:00.589 --> 39:02.924
is you kinda suck at lying.

39:21.109 --> 39:23.070
Want another?

39:31.328 --> 39:33.121
Let's get out of here.

39:33.163 --> 39:35.582
I just got here.

39:35.624 --> 39:38.418
I can sort it out
with your bosmang.

39:38.460 --> 39:42.172
I'm sure you can.
I know who you are.

39:42.214 --> 39:44.758
- So, let's go, then.
-

39:44.800 --> 39:47.177
This all it takes
with your other girls?

39:47.219 --> 39:48.762
Other girls?

39:48.804 --> 39:50.222
Oh, that's your problem?

39:50.263 --> 39:52.808
You should go find
one of them.

39:52.849 --> 39:54.309
You're fucking lucky

39:54.351 --> 39:56.937
I'm even talking
to someone like you.

40:08.448 --> 40:10.992
Here.

40:11.034 --> 40:12.953
This one's on the house.

40:19.251 --> 40:21.336
I'm a fucking hero!

40:21.378 --> 40:23.338
I kill the Earthers, me.

40:23.380 --> 40:25.090
Millions of them
for people like you.

40:25.132 --> 40:26.424
Oye, Filip,
you're coming in hot, huh?

40:26.466 --> 40:27.884
- I'm a fucking hero.
- Okay, come on, let's go.

40:27.926 --> 40:29.803
- I take you back to the ship.
- Don't fucking touch me.

40:29.845 --> 40:32.055
Hey, easy.
I'm your friend.

40:32.097 --> 40:33.640
No, you're a fucking joke.

40:33.682 --> 40:36.643
- The fuck gotten into you?
- You're pathetic.

40:36.685 --> 40:39.104
You know, if not for me,
all these girls on the station,

40:39.146 --> 40:40.272
they laugh at you, huh?

40:40.313 --> 40:41.648
Come on, don't do this.

40:41.690 --> 40:43.525
Why? The fuck you gonna
do about it, huh?

40:43.567 --> 40:44.860
Huh?

40:50.031 --> 40:51.533
-
- Ah!

41:10.385 --> 41:11.678
Come.

41:13.180 --> 41:15.682
You wanted to see me, ma'am?

41:17.100 --> 41:21.521
I never thought I'd actually
enjoy this sensation.

41:22.898 --> 41:25.942
Maybe it's the lack
of sensation.

41:27.652 --> 41:33.158
The whole planet not
pulling me down for once.

41:34.784 --> 41:36.953
I can come back
if you like.

41:36.995 --> 41:38.163
No.

41:40.290 --> 41:41.833
A little help?

41:52.636 --> 41:54.804
Time for your
performance review.

41:54.846 --> 41:56.014
My what?

41:56.056 --> 41:58.850
You hate this job.

42:01.061 --> 42:02.979
Yes, ma'am, I do.

42:03.021 --> 42:04.940
I understand.
I'll step down...

42:04.981 --> 42:06.942
If I don't get
the easy way out,

42:06.983 --> 42:08.610
neither do you.

42:08.652 --> 42:10.487
Your problem
is that you're a Marine.

42:10.528 --> 42:12.948
You're sick of doing nothing.

42:12.989 --> 42:14.074
So are you.

42:14.115 --> 42:16.993
So is the whole fucking
planet.

42:20.664 --> 42:23.291
I just received
word from Holden.

42:23.333 --> 42:25.293
He believes
they've located

42:25.335 --> 42:27.003
an Inaros spotter ship.

42:29.589 --> 42:31.633
They're going
to check it out,

42:31.675 --> 42:34.636
see if they're right.

42:34.678 --> 42:37.722
If they are,
that would be good.

42:37.764 --> 42:40.308
Fuck good.

42:40.350 --> 42:42.769
We need better than good.

42:45.355 --> 42:47.857
We're wounded, broken,

42:47.899 --> 42:50.610
trying desperately
to keep ourselves going

42:50.652 --> 42:52.904
by pretending we're not.

42:52.946 --> 42:57.492
Gutting through it all,
wearing down.

42:57.534 --> 42:59.786
Little wins here and there

42:59.828 --> 43:02.497
will not hold us together.

43:02.539 --> 43:05.292
We need more than that.

43:05.333 --> 43:08.295
Something big.

43:08.336 --> 43:11.840
Something to give us
a reason to hope.

43:14.134 --> 43:17.012
You have something in mind?

43:18.722 --> 43:21.182
I do.
