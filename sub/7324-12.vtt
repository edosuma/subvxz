IT'S IN A VERY LARGE REGION
OF HIS SPINE.

06:50.541 --> 06:53.484
THERE IS THE VERY LIKELY RISK
OF PARALYSIS--

06:53.484 --> 06:54.985
FROM HIS UPPER BODY DOWN.
THERE'S ALSO THE RISK OF DEATH,

07:11.832 --> 07:13.534
SO WHAT I WANT TO KNOW

07:13.534 --> 07:15.606
IS, ARE YOU GONNA SAY
ANYTHING DIFFERENT,

07:15.606 --> 07:17.938
OR DO I HAVE TO TAKE MY KID
SOMEWHERE ELSE?

07:17.938 --> 07:20.140
HMM.

07:21.572 --> 07:24.575
THERE IS ONLY A 5% CHANCE
OF SUCCESS.

07:24.575 --> 07:26.717
MAYBE A LITTLE LESS.

07:29.119 --> 07:32.122
YES, IF YOU'RE WILLING,
I'LL TRY.

07:35.726 --> 07:37.187
(exhales)

07:37.187 --> 07:39.490
OKAY.
SHOULD I GO TELL WES?

07:39.490 --> 07:43.093
WAIT. UM...
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE.

07:43.093 --> 07:44.895
HE--HE DOESN'T KNOW
ABOUT HIS TUMOR.

07:44.895 --> 07:46.897
HE'S 11, A YOUNG 11,

07:46.897 --> 07:49.469
AND KNOWING THAT HE'S
VERY LIKELY GONNA DIE

07:49.469 --> 07:51.201
IS NOT SOMETHING
THAT'S GONNA DO HIM ANY GOOD.

07:51.201 --> 07:53.974
WH-WHY DOES HE THINK
HE'S HERE?

07:53.974 --> 07:56.777
A BACKACHE.

07:56.777 --> 07:59.980
A VERY BAD BACKACHE.

08:10.020 --> 08:11.662
(people speak indistinctly)

08:16.897 --> 08:18.268
HEY, DR. BAILEY.
HMM?

08:18.268 --> 08:19.770
CHIEF HUNT SAYS I NEED
TO DECLARE A SPECIALTY.

08:19.770 --> 08:21.271
MM.
HE SUGGESTED GENERAL.

08:21.271 --> 08:23.033
GOOD FOR YOU.
MINI ELLIS GREY.

08:23.033 --> 08:24.735
NO. I'M STILL
ON THE FENCE ABOUT IT

08:24.735 --> 08:27.277
BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT
OF SPECIALTIES OUT THERE--

08:27.277 --> 08:28.779
DON'T BE AN IDIOT.
IT'S IN YOUR GENES, GREY.

08:28.779 --> 08:30.641
IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE.

08:30.641 --> 08:33.043
(indistinct conversations)

08:33.043 --> 08:34.745
OH, UH, KAREN AND MARCY,

08:34.745 --> 08:36.747
I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET
DR. BAILEY AND DR. GREY.

08:36.747 --> 08:38.018
MM-HMM.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.721
THEY'LL BE PERFORMING THE LIVER
TRANSPLANT WITH ME TODAY.

08:40.721 --> 08:41.852
NICE TO MEET YOU.

08:41.852 --> 08:43.824
(sighs) THIS I.V.
REALLY HURTS.

08:43.824 --> 08:46.156
YOU THINK
IT COULD BE INFECTED?

08:46.156 --> 08:47.828
I MEAN, I'M ALREADY MISSING
MY FAMILY VACATION FOR THIS.

08:47.828 --> 08:49.960
I'D--I'D HATE TO DIE
OF STAPH.

08:49.960 --> 08:51.662
YOU'RE NOT GONNA DIE,
MARCY.

08:51.662 --> 08:53.664
I AM THE ONE
IN LIVER FAILURE.

08:53.664 --> 08:56.306
IT DOESN'T LOOK INFECTED.
A LITTLE DISCOMFORT IS NORMAL.

08:56.306 --> 08:58.609
THANK YOU.
I'M SORRY. I'M JUST NERVOUS.

08:58.609 --> 09:00.771
I'VE NEVER HAD
A MAJOR SURGERY BEFORE.

09:00.771 --> 09:03.674
BUT WHEN YOUR SISTER CALLS YOU

09:03.674 --> 09:06.617
TO COME AND SAVE HER LIFE,
I MEAN, YOU TAKE THAT CALL.

09:06.617 --> 09:08.779
HOW LUCKY I AM
TO HAVE JUST THAT SISTER.

09:08.779 --> 09:09.820
(laughs) YES, YOU ARE.

09:09.820 --> 09:10.921
WELL, THE LABS LOOK GOOD.

09:10.921 --> 09:12.082
WE'RE READY FOR TRANSPLANT.

09:12.082 --> 09:13.924
IN THE MEANTIME,
WHY DON'T WE RELAX?

09:13.924 --> 09:16.286
RELAX IN A HOSPITAL?

09:16.286 --> 09:18.989
IT'D BE A LOT EASIER
ON A WHITE, SANDY BEACH.

09:18.989 --> 09:22.062
I'M GONNA REIMBURSE YOU
FOR THIS TRIP. I PROMISE.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.964
I JUST HOPE
I DON'T DIE IN THERE.

09:23.964 --> 09:26.797
I MEAN, IT WOULD BE HARD
TO REIMBURSE ME FOR MY LIFE.

09:26.797 --> 09:27.998
THANK YOU, MARCY.
(sighs)

09:27.998 --> 09:29.940
I JUST CAN'T
THANK YOU ENOUGH.

09:29.940 --> 09:31.772
OH, WELL, YOU'RE WELCOME.

09:33.804 --> 09:35.846
FORT TICONDEROGA
IS PROBABLY MY FAVORITE.

09:35.846 --> 09:38.078
IT'S NOT GIANT LIKE GETTYSBURG
OR FAMOUS LIKE THE ALAMO.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.249
YOU FEEL
ANY PAIN HERE, WES?

09:39.249 --> 09:40.651
MM. A LITTLE.

09:40.651 --> 09:42.012
STILL, IT WAS
A REALLY IMPORTANT FORT.

09:42.012 --> 09:43.954
IT CHANGED HANDS
A BUNCH OF TIMES

09:43.954 --> 09:46.256
IN JUST A FEW YEARS.

09:46.256 --> 09:47.888
BENEDICT ARNOLD
EVEN FOUGHT THERE.

09:47.888 --> 09:49.790
HE'S GOT A THING
ABOUT BATTLEFIELDS.

09:49.790 --> 09:51.622
I SEE THAT. HEY, RELAX.

09:51.622 --> 09:54.865
MY MOM SAYS I GET IT FROM
MY DAD. HE DIED WHEN I WAS 2.

09:54.865 --> 09:57.197
WE'VE GONE TO 18 BATTLEFIELDS
IN THE PAST YEAR.

09:57.197 --> 10:00.130
WE HOMESCHOOL
BECAUSE OF THE BACK PAIN.

10:00.130 --> 10:02.002
IT'S SO COOL. I WAKE UP,
AND WE GET TO DECIDE

10:02.002 --> 10:03.133
WHAT I DO THAT DAY.

10:03.133 --> 10:05.305
NEXT WEEK, WE'RE GOING
TO PEARL HARBOR.

10:05.305 --> 10:07.908
THAT WAY, MY MOM CAN HAVE
A BEACH VACATION, TOO.

10:07.908 --> 10:10.881
ACTUALLY, WES, WE MAY BE
POSTPONING HAWAII.

10:10.881 --> 10:13.143
DR. SHEPHERD THINKS HE MIGHT
BE ABLE TO FIX YOUR BACK.

10:13.143 --> 10:15.716
REALLY? THEN I WON'T HAVE
THESE ACHES ANYMORE?

10:15.716 --> 10:17.748
WELL, THAT'S THE PLAN.

10:19.149 --> 10:21.692
WHAT ABOUT ORTHO? CALLIE
WOULD BE A GREAT MENTOR.

10:21.692 --> 10:22.893
BONES?
ONCOLOGY.

10:22.893 --> 10:24.024
DEPRESSING.
TRAUMA.

10:24.024 --> 10:25.896
I'VE HAD ENOUGH TRAUMA
FOR ONE LIFETIME.

10:25.896 --> 10:28.298
WELL, JUST PICK SOMETHING.
THIS DECISION IS IMPORTANT.

10:28.298 --> 10:30.060
CHECK IT.

10:30.060 --> 10:32.132
FENCE GUY--HEART'S THE SIZE
OF A FOOTBALL.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.234

FROM BEING IMPALED ON A FENCE.

10:34.234 --> 10:35.766
DON'T WORRY, YANG.

10:35.766 --> 10:37.037
I'LL SEND YOU PICS
FROM THE SURGERY.

10:37.037 --> 10:38.909
(laughs)

10:38.909 --> 10:40.340
HEY, IS IT TOO LATE
FOR ME TO PICK CARDIO?

10:40.340 --> 10:41.912
YES. CARDIO'S MINE.

10:41.912 --> 10:43.373

14:41.481 --> 14:43.213

14:43.213 --> 14:44.384
DOES YOUR MOM KNOW
THAT YOU KNOW?

14:59.529 --> 15:01.671

THAT MAKES HER HAPPY

THAT I DON'T KNOW.

ZOLA'S KILLING MY GAME.

I'M NOT LIVING WITH YOU.

15:55.725 --> 15:57.557
I AM TRYING TO GET AWAY
FROM YOU.
ALL RIGHT, THEN YOU AND ME.

15:57.557 --> 15:59.129
YOU DON'T WANT TO LIVE
WITH MARY POPPINS.

15:59.129 --> 16:01.091
NO, SHE COOKS, SHE CLEANS--
I'M ALSO YOUR FRIEND.

16:01.091 --> 16:02.362
WHAT THE HELL?

16:02.362 --> 16:04.134
I NEED FOOD

16:04.134 --> 16:05.595

TIME TO GO TO THE STORE,

16:05.595 --> 16:07.567
BUT RICHARD'S 10,000th SURGERY
IS GONNA TAKE FOREVER.

16:07.567 --> 16:09.569
YOU THINK TEDDY'S GONNA CARE
IF I TAKE

16:09.569 --> 16:11.241
SOME OF
HER WIDOW CASSEROLES?

16:11.241 --> 16:13.103
NO. GO FOR IT. YOU KNOW WHAT?
TAKE THIS ONE, TOO.

16:13.103 --> 16:15.245

DON'T LEAVE ME.

GONNA DO--NEURO, CARDIO?

20:55.385 --> 20:56.356

PREDICTABLE ORGAN

21:05.895 --> 21:08.298
LEAPING FROM THE LIVER
TO THE PANCREAS TO THE STOMACH

21:08.298 --> 21:10.340
TO THE BOWEL,

21:10.340 --> 21:12.802
AND ANY ONE COULD GO WRONG
AT ANYTIME.

21:12.802 --> 21:16.275
OKAY, SURE. THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH KNOWING ONE ORGAN

21:16.275 --> 21:17.847
AND KNOWING IT WELL,

21:17.847 --> 21:19.849

WANT TO TALK TO ME,

22:34.123 --> 22:36.486
BUT THIS HAS GONE ON
TOO LONG.

22:36.486 --> 22:38.428
NOW I UNDERSTAND WHY,
AT LEAST...

22:38.428 --> 22:40.490
I WANT TO.

22:40.490 --> 22:41.991
WE NEED TO TALK.

22:41.991 --> 22:43.733
CAN WE JUST TALK?

22:43.733 --> 22:45.034
NOW IS NOT A GOOD TIME.

22:45.034 --> 22:46.396
TEDDY. HEY--

22:46.396 --> 22:48.568
DON'T!

22:48.568 --> 22:52.902

22:58.408 --> 22:59.649
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
DR. GREY?

22:59.649 --> 23:03.483
THINK WE SHOULD START
WITH, UH, T-4?

23:03.483 --> 23:06.015
YEAH, I, UH, I STILL THINK
THAT'S THE BEST APPROACH.

23:06.015 --> 23:07.757
THERE'S NO CLEAR
PREVERTEBRAL PLANE.

23:07.757 --> 23:10.560
ALL RIGHT, WELL, TAKE ME
THROUGH IT, STEP-BY-STEP.

23:10.560 --> 23:13.423
OKAY, WE GET UP ABOVE
T-3, MAYBE T-2,

23:13.423 --> 23:15.925
WE GET CONTROL
OF THE AORTA PROXIMALLY,

23:15.925 --> 23:18.468
AND THEN DISSECT
THE LARGE VESSELS FREE.

23:18.468 --> 23:20.970
WE PRESERVE THE RADICULAR
BRANCHES AS WE GO,

23:20.970 --> 23:22.802
ESPECIALLY ADAMKIEWICZ--

23:22.802 --> 23:24.674
HE'S PARALYZED IF WE GO
ANYWHERE NEAR THE ADAMKIEWICZ.

23:24.674 --> 23:28.137
WE DON'T GET THIS TUMOR,
THIS SURGERY IS FOR NOTHING.

23:28.137 --> 23:29.809
RIGHT.

23:29.809 --> 23:33.813
SO... WE GO IN
FAR LATERAL INSTEAD?

23:33.813 --> 23:36.446
ARE YOU ASKING ME
OR TELLING ME?

23:36.446 --> 23:37.947
I'M TELLING.

23:37.947 --> 23:40.490
I MEAN, UM, WE COULD
MOBILIZE THE GREAT VESSELS,

23:40.490 --> 23:44.524
AND THAT WAY, WE GET ACCESS
TO THE TUMOR ON BOTH SIDES.

23:44.524 --> 23:46.125
(beeping continues)

23:46.125 --> 23:48.027
(Derek) CAN I GET
SOME SUCTION IN HERE?

23:48.027 --> 23:50.099
(Richard) I'VE ATTACHED
THE HEPATIC VEINS.

23:50.099 --> 23:53.533
NOW I'M RECONSTRUCTING
THE PORTAL VEIN.

23:53.533 --> 23:55.535
HE LEFT ME. HE LEFT ME.
I DON'T WANT TO SEE HIM WORKING.

23:55.535 --> 23:56.836
NO--
HE'S ALWAYS WORKING.

23:56.836 --> 23:58.608
NO, NO, HE DIDN'T LEAVE YOU.
HE'S RIGHT THERE.

23:58.608 --> 24:00.770
SEE?

24:00.770 --> 24:03.613
OH, HE'S WITH THAT WOMAN?

24:03.613 --> 24:05.615
YOU TELL THAT WOMAN
TO GO AWAY.

24:05.615 --> 24:07.517
THAT'S MY HUSBAND
NOT HERS.

24:07.517 --> 24:09.619
RICHARD!
(switch clicks)

24:10.920 --> 24:14.183
Richard, why are you
doing this to me, to us?

24:14.183 --> 24:15.454
ADELE?

24:15.454 --> 24:16.856
You lied.

24:16.856 --> 24:18.457
YOU SAID THAT YOU WEREN'T
WORKING WITH HER ANYMORE.

24:18.457 --> 24:19.859
DR. WEBBER,

24:19.859 --> 24:22.461
I-I'm sorry.
I didn't know what to do.

24:22.461 --> 24:23.733
ELLIS!
YOU LET HIM GO.

24:23.733 --> 24:26.195
Um, Dr. Webber,
do you want me to--

24:26.195 --> 24:28.768
No, no,
keep the line open.

24:28.768 --> 24:30.840
Adele...

24:30.840 --> 24:32.802
That's not Ellis, Adele.

24:32.802 --> 24:34.574
WHAT KIND OF WOMAN
WOULD BREAK UP A MARRIAGE?

24:34.574 --> 24:36.506
Huh? Ellis Grey,

24:36.506 --> 24:37.777
WHAT KIND OF WOMAN
ARE YOU?

24:37.777 --> 24:39.478
(lowered voice) I'M SORRY.

24:39.478 --> 24:40.810
(lowered voice) WELL,
I-I SHOULD JUST SCRUB OUT.

24:40.810 --> 24:42.111
NO, NO,
I NEED THE EXTRA HANDS.

24:42.111 --> 24:44.654
I will not have you
down there with my husband.

24:44.654 --> 24:46.485
Do you hear me?
I will not have it.

24:46.485 --> 24:48.618
Richard, you just
send her away.

24:48.618 --> 24:50.760
(normal voice) ADELE...

24:50.760 --> 24:52.592
I'm right here.

24:52.592 --> 24:53.793
I'M NOT LEAVING YOU.
Richard!

24:53.793 --> 24:55.665
TELL HER SOMETHING
THAT'LL GROUND HER--

24:55.665 --> 24:57.597
A HAPPY MEMORY.
(crying) Richard!

24:57.597 --> 24:59.669
A HAPPY MEMORY,
IT WORKED FOR MY MOM.

24:59.669 --> 25:01.531
RICHARD.

25:01.531 --> 25:03.533

26:41.671 --> 26:43.833
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL BRIDE
I'VE EVER SEEN.

26:43.833 --> 26:45.905
OH, RICHARD. (giggles)

26:45.905 --> 26:48.738
they played

26:48.738 --> 26:50.680
"MY FUNNY VALENTINE."

26:50.680 --> 26:54.043
BECAUSE WE'RE GETTING MARRIED
ON VALENTINE'S DAY.

26:56.215 --> 26:59.088
HAPPY VALENTINE'S DAY,
BABY.

26:59.088 --> 27:00.790
(sighs)

27:00.790 --> 27:02.621
I LOVE YOU.

27:02.621 --> 27:05.054
(giggles)

27:05.054 --> 27:07.226
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

27:07.226 --> 27:10.900
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

27:10.900 --> 27:12.361
(suction gurgling)

27:12.361 --> 27:15.164
TELL BAILEY
TO CANCEL THE PARTY.

27:15.164 --> 27:17.636
(beeping continues)

27:29.949 --> 27:31.180
(siren wails)

27:31.180 --> 27:32.822
SO ONCE THE VERTEBRECTOMIES
ARE COMPLETE,

27:32.822 --> 27:34.954
WE TAKE THE TUMOR DOWN
OFF THE DURA,

27:34.954 --> 27:37.356
DO A MYELOTOMY--
AND AGAIN HIT
THE ADAMKIEWICZ.

27:37.356 --> 27:38.327
PARALYZED,
DEAD IN THREE MONTHS.

27:38.327 --> 27:39.959
WE RESECT IT FREE
FROM THE AORTA--

27:39.959 --> 27:41.390
SPINAL SHOCK. DEAD.

27:41.390 --> 27:43.662
HARVEST A RADICULAR BRANCH THAT
DOESN'T HAVE TUMOR INVOLVEMENT--

27:43.662 --> 27:44.293
DEAD AGAIN.

27:44.293 --> 27:45.835
OKAY, STOP SAYING THAT.

27:45.835 --> 27:46.996
DR. GREY.

27:46.996 --> 27:49.298
NO, WE TOLD HIM
THAT WE WOULD TRY.

27:49.298 --> 27:50.940
YOU'RE NOT EVEN TRYING.

27:50.940 --> 27:52.942
(exhales deeply) BECAUSE
THE SURGERY WILL KILL HIM.

27:52.942 --> 27:55.104
WE HAVE NO CHOICE.
WE HAVE TO CLOSE HIM UP.

27:55.104 --> 27:56.375
NO.

27:56.375 --> 27:58.047
DR. GREY, I THINK IT'S TIME
YOU JUST--

27:58.047 --> 27:59.378
NO, YOU'RE QUITTING.

27:59.378 --> 28:01.010
OKAY, IT'S--IT'S NOT RIGHT,
NOT WHEN WE SAID

28:01.010 --> 28:02.181
THAT WE WOULD TRY.

28:02.181 --> 28:03.352
THERE'S A 5% CHANCE.
WE--WE OWE HIM--

28:03.352 --> 28:07.016
THERE IS NO LONGER
A 5% CHANCE.

28:07.016 --> 28:09.418
GELFOAM, PLEASE.

28:09.418 --> 28:10.689
NO.

28:10.689 --> 28:12.892
HE KNOWS ABOUT THE TUMOR.

28:12.892 --> 28:14.393
HE HAS KNOWN ALL ALONG.

28:14.393 --> 28:16.225
I T--I...

28:16.225 --> 28:17.867
I TOLD HIM THAT WE WOULD TRY.

28:17.867 --> 28:20.169
I TOLD HIM
THAT YOU WERE THE BEST.

28:20.169 --> 28:22.371
NOW PLEASE, DEREK,
JUST...

28:22.371 --> 28:23.973
PLEASE.

28:23.973 --> 28:26.906
LEAVE THE O.R.,
RIGHT NOW.

28:26.906 --> 28:29.909
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

28:33.242 --> 28:35.745
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S CLOSE HIM UP.

28:35.745 --> 28:38.417
(beeping continues)

28:38.417 --> 28:41.420
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

28:41.420 --> 28:44.053
(indistinct conversations)

28:44.053 --> 28:45.324
NO PARTY?

28:45.324 --> 28:47.456
CANCELED.
HELP YOURSELF TO CAKE.

28:47.456 --> 28:50.729
KAREV, WHY AREN'T YOU
STILL IN McQUEEN'S SURGERY?

28:50.729 --> 28:52.832
OH, UH, ALTMAN
AND, UH, YANG TOOK THAT.

28:52.832 --> 28:54.033
WHAT?

28:54.033 --> 28:57.166
(siren wailing)

28:57.166 --> 28:58.737
(indistinct conversations
continue)

28:58.737 --> 29:00.739
I COULD BE WRONG.

29:03.512 --> 29:05.344
(sighs)

29:06.475 --> 29:08.177
YOU HAVE TO TELL HIM.

29:08.177 --> 29:09.478
BUT I THOUGHT
HE ALREADY KNEW.

29:09.478 --> 29:12.521
NO, ABOUT THE TUMOR, NOT THAT
WE DIDN'T DO THE SURGERY.

29:12.521 --> 29:14.383
HIS--HIS MOM'S
NOT GONNA TELL HIM,

29:14.383 --> 29:15.985
AND HE'S GONNA WAKE UP,

29:15.985 --> 29:17.827
AND SHE'S GONNA TELL HIM
THAT IT ALL WENT GREAT,

29:17.827 --> 29:20.189
AND HE'S GONNA GO HOME THINKING
THAT WE DID THE SURGERY,

29:20.189 --> 29:22.091
NOT THAT HE'S GONNA DIE
IN THREE MONTHS.

29:22.091 --> 29:24.363
YOU NEED TO TELL HIM.

29:24.363 --> 29:26.035
SHE'S THE PARENT.

29:26.035 --> 29:27.766
IT IS NOT OUR CALL.

29:27.766 --> 29:30.769
I'M SORRY, NO.

29:30.769 --> 29:32.771
WE CAN'T TELL HIM ANYTHING.

29:36.205 --> 29:37.376
(sighs deeply)

29:37.376 --> 29:39.448
(people speak indistinctly)

29:39.448 --> 29:40.980
(suction gurgling,
monitor beeping rhythmically)

29:40.980 --> 29:43.082
THAT LOOKS
MORE LIKE A HEART.

29:43.082 --> 29:44.353
RIGHT?

29:44.353 --> 29:46.015
(gurgling continues)

29:46.015 --> 29:49.218
(beeping continues)

29:49.218 --> 29:51.220
(door hisses open)

29:51.220 --> 29:53.562
(beeping continues)

29:53.562 --> 29:55.364
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

29:55.364 --> 29:56.866
McQUEEN WASN'T QUALIFIED.

29:56.866 --> 29:58.497
(sighs) I THINK I WAS
CLEAR IN THE E.R.

29:58.497 --> 30:00.429
YEAH, I'M HEAD OF
THE DEPARTMENT. I MADE THE CALL.

30:00.429 --> 30:01.871
PUT ANOTHER PLEDGETED SUTURE
RIGHT HERE.

30:01.871 --> 30:03.802
RIGHT HERE
BETWEEN THESE TWO?

30:03.802 --> 30:06.075
UH, YEAH, BUT CLOSER
TO THE ATRIUM.

30:06.075 --> 30:07.206
YOU SHOULD'VE INFORMED ME.

30:07.206 --> 30:08.237
THERE WASN'T TIME.

30:08.237 --> 30:09.478
(scoffs)

30:09.478 --> 30:11.140
DR. YANG STOPPED AND HAD
A NICE LITTLE CHAT WITH ME

30:11.140 --> 30:13.182
A COUPLE OF HOURS AGO
ON HER WAY TO WHAT I BELIEVE

30:13.182 --> 30:14.483
IS THIS PROCEDURE.

30:14.483 --> 30:16.215
AND THEN I SPOKE TO YOU,
AND YOU--

30:16.215 --> 30:18.547
WELL, WE DIDN'T KNOW THAT
WE WERE DOING THE SURGERY THEN.

30:18.547 --> 30:21.020
I THINK YOU'RE LYING TO ME.
BOTH OF YOU--

30:21.020 --> 30:22.892
YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS IS
A FAIRLY COMPLICATED PROCEDURE.

30:22.892 --> 30:24.223
CAN WE
GET INTO THIS LATER?

30:24.223 --> 30:26.956
SHALL WE DO
AN INTRAOPERATIVE ECHO?

30:26.956 --> 30:28.557
YES. WHY DON'T YOU
PULL IT OVER?

30:28.557 --> 30:30.459
FIND ME WHEN
YOU'RE FINISHED, DOCTOR.

30:30.459 --> 30:32.001
MM-HMM.

30:32.001 --> 30:34.533
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

30:34.533 --> 30:36.966
DID YOU SEE
THAT THROBBING VEIN...
(laughing)

30:36.966 --> 30:38.307
IN HIS FOREHEAD?

30:38.307 --> 30:39.608
I HAVE THE HARDEST TIME
KEEPING A STRAIGHT FACE

30:39.608 --> 30:41.270
WHEN IT POPS UP.

30:41.270 --> 30:44.313
(Cristina and Teddy laughing)

30:44.313 --> 30:45.514
AND THE, UH...

30:45.514 --> 30:48.347
THE SURGERY WASN'T AS HARD
AS THEY FIRST THOUGHT,

30:48.347 --> 30:51.050
WHICH IS GOOD.

30:51.050 --> 30:53.052
'CAUSE THAT MEANS WE CAN
MAKE IT TO, UH,

30:53.052 --> 30:55.524
TO HAWAII NOW.

30:55.524 --> 30:57.586
YOU'RE DONE.

30:57.586 --> 30:59.628
NO MORE SURGERIES
OR DOCTORS.

30:59.628 --> 31:02.631
THAT'S IT.
IT'S JUST US.

31:02.631 --> 31:04.633
AND WE'RE GONNA GO ON
ANOTHER TRIP AFTER THAT, TOO.

31:04.633 --> 31:07.636
MAYBE EVEN NORMANDY,
LIKE WE SAID.

31:07.636 --> 31:09.498
DOESN'T THAT SOUND FUN?

31:13.872 --> 31:15.544
YOU DIDN'T DO IT.

31:16.946 --> 31:18.607
WHAT?

31:18.607 --> 31:20.609
YOU SAID,
AFTER THE SURGERY,

31:20.609 --> 31:23.882
I'D BE STUCK IN HERE
FOR A FEW WEEKS.

31:23.882 --> 31:26.515
THAT'S RIGHT. I DID.

31:26.515 --> 31:29.888
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES
WHEN WE GET IN THERE,

31:29.888 --> 31:31.420
THINGS CHANGE.

31:31.420 --> 31:33.162
THAT'S WHY
YOU GET TO GO HOME.

31:35.564 --> 31:37.296
WHICH IS A GOOD THING.

31:37.296 --> 31:38.597
HONEY...

31:38.597 --> 31:41.430
IT'S ALL GONNA BE FINE.

31:41.430 --> 31:43.432
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

31:43.432 --> 31:45.534
MOMMY'S GONNA
MAKE SURE OF IT.

31:45.534 --> 31:47.176
AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY.

31:47.176 --> 31:49.508
I PROMISE.

31:49.508 --> 31:53.182
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY, TOO.

31:53.182 --> 31:56.315
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT ME.

31:56.315 --> 31:59.288
I'M GONNA BE
WITH DAD IN HEAVEN.

32:06.125 --> 32:09.959
(woman crying and sniffling)

32:13.502 --> 32:16.935
(crying continues)

32:20.569 --> 32:22.271
(cries)

32:27.246 --> 32:28.717
(siren wails)

32:28.717 --> 32:30.249
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

32:30.249 --> 32:31.380
HOW'D IT GO?

32:31.380 --> 32:33.452
GREAT. YOU ARE
THE PROUD NEW OWNER

32:33.452 --> 32:35.654
OF A FULLY FUNCTIONING
LIVER.

32:35.654 --> 32:37.556
(sighs) THANK GOD.

32:37.556 --> 32:40.529
DON'T THANK GOD.
THANK ME.

32:40.529 --> 32:42.431
I'LL NEVER BE ABLE
TO WEAR A TWO-PIECE AGAIN.

32:42.431 --> 32:44.433
IT'S A HORRIBLE SCAR.

32:44.433 --> 32:46.665
I HAVE THANKED YOU,
MARCY,

32:46.665 --> 32:49.268
ABOUT A MILLION TIMES.

32:49.268 --> 32:51.270
OKAY, ENOUGH. WE'RE NOT
GONNA DO THIS AGAIN.

32:51.270 --> 32:53.342
BUT IT DOESN'T SEEM
TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE.

32:53.342 --> 32:55.444
YOU JUST DON'T GET IT.

32:55.444 --> 32:56.745
SO I'M DONE.

32:56.745 --> 32:58.107
EXCUSE ME?

32:58.107 --> 32:59.678
I AM DONE THANKING YOU.

32:59.678 --> 33:02.111
YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED
TO MENTION

33:02.111 --> 33:04.153
YOUR EXTRAORDINARY GENEROSITY
ANYMORE,

33:04.153 --> 33:05.984
EXCEPT ONCE A YEAR
ON THANKSGIVING.

33:05.984 --> 33:07.456
OKAY, YOU'RE GONNA
HURT YOURSELF.

33:07.456 --> 33:09.458
AND ON THAT NIGHT,
I WILL THANK YOU.

33:09.458 --> 33:11.490
BUT IF YOU DON'T FOLLOW
MY RULES--

33:11.490 --> 33:13.622
OH, THERE ARE RULES?

33:13.622 --> 33:15.364
YES.
I WILL HAVE TO BRING UP

33:15.364 --> 33:16.625
EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU

33:16.625 --> 33:19.068
THAT I HAVE HAPPILY CHOSEN
TO NOT MENTION,

33:19.068 --> 33:21.700
LIKE HOW YOU'VE LOST
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS

33:21.700 --> 33:23.772
IN THAT LIPSTICK SELLING
PONZI SCHEME.

33:23.772 --> 33:25.604
