Arrogant river? Deposition of silt?

24:31.209 --> 24:34.379
It is actually the silt,
and I'm going to show you...

24:34.462 --> 24:38.341
Erm, the silt
goes into a sort of super silt.

24:42.720 --> 24:46.224
Bless, O Lord, this food to our use
and bless us to your service,

24:46.307 --> 24:50.311
make us mindful of the needs of others,
through Jesus Christ, Amen.

25:07.912 --> 25:10.999
Don't go in that shed again.
Do you understand?

25:12.167 --> 25:14.252
Do you understand?!

25:21.176 --> 25:24.846
I need you all up early
for the preaching tomorrow.

25:24.929 --> 25:27.182
- But I can't come.
- Of course you can.

25:27.265 --> 25:30.518
- No, see, there's this boy at school...
- There's lots of boys.

25:30.602 --> 25:34.814
No, I mean... This one was badly hurt,

25:34.898 --> 25:38.651
and I promised to help him
with his chores tomorrow.

25:47.619 --> 25:49.621
What happened to him?

25:49.704 --> 25:52.916
He... He had a terrible accident,

25:52.999 --> 25:55.919
and I promised I'd help him
with his chores tomorrow.

25:57.170 --> 25:58.963
That's...

26:00.048 --> 26:02.342
That's very kind of you.

26:04.427 --> 26:07.055
Look, I'm sorry for getting angry
all the time.

26:07.138 --> 26:10.850

and help this boy if you want.

It's not fit for dogs.

And the screams at night.
There's folk screaming in their beds.

34:56.833 --> 35:02.673
But I don't know if they're hurting
or just... afraid of something.

35:02.756 --> 35:05.884

We're going to escape!

35:05.968 --> 35:08.554

I'll kill you! Get out of here!

35:12.474 --> 35:16.436

38:15.782 --> 38:18.118
How long do we have to hold it
like this for?

38:18.201 --> 38:20.996
Until we hear that wood pigeon again.

38:25.667 --> 38:28.044

38:29.212 --> 38:32.882
Oh, so I won't ever get it back, then?

38:32.966 --> 38:35.176
No. He likes it.

38:35.302 --> 38:37.971
Wasrt mine anyway. It was my dad's.

38:38.054 --> 38:41.766
Is he pissed off with you?

38:41.850 --> 38:44.102
He's dead.

38:44.936 --> 38:47.105
Oh. Right.

38:47.188 --> 38:50.942
- How did he die?
- Mowing the lawn.

38:57.741 --> 39:00.869
It wasrt the mowing that did it,
you idiot.

39:00.952 --> 39:03.038
He had a thing called an aneurysm.

39:03.121 --> 39:06.124
A little vein in his head popped,
and that was that.

39:06.207 --> 39:08.460
He just, sort of, fell to the ground

39:08.543 --> 39:12.339
and the lawnmower kept going
and tipped up and... into the fence

39:12.422 --> 39:15.967
and made this really loud noise
as if it was hungry or something.

39:16.051 --> 39:19.846
It kept going "Rrrr,"
until they switched it off.

39:21.139 --> 39:25.852
- Jesus! I hope my veins don't pop.
- Me, too.

39:25.935 --> 39:28.730
My brother said you can kill someone
with one punch.

39:28.813 --> 39:31.358
Really?
Yeah. If you hit 'em right in the nose,

39:31.441 --> 39:34.319
their bone goes up through their brain
and kills 'em.

39:34.402 --> 39:36.821
Wow! Has he ever killed anyone
like that?

39:36.905 --> 39:40.909
No. He could if he wanted to, though.
He's pretty skill at everything.

39:40.992 --> 39:43.286
Do you like him?

39:43.411 --> 39:46.539
Well, yeah, course I do.
He's my brother, isn't he?

39:47.665 --> 39:49.626
What about your dad?

39:49.709 --> 39:52.545
My dad? No.
He pissed off before I was born.

39:52.712 --> 39:56.341
Then my mum met Colin, the bloke with
the big hair? He owns the care home,

39:56.424 --> 39:59.052
so we all live there.
It's alright, I suppose.

39:59.135 --> 40:02.639
But he lives in Spain, so my mum's
always over there with him.

40:02.764 --> 40:05.100
She gets tons of duty-free and stuff,

40:05.183 --> 40:08.353
which is kind of skill,
cos it's mostly just me and Lawrence.

40:08.436 --> 40:11.940
We get to do what we want, muck
about. There's no-one to tell us off.

40:12.065 --> 40:14.526
Seriously, though, parents...

40:14.609 --> 40:18.738
You're pretty much better off
without 'em. That's what I say.

40:22.325 --> 40:24.953
- Colonel Trautman.
- Yeah?

40:25.036 --> 40:28.581
Not including the bit
about losing my dad's watch,

40:28.665 --> 40:31.376
this has been my best day of all time.

40:31.459 --> 40:34.420

Amen.

41:08.079 --> 41:09.831
He's been lying, Mary.

41:09.914 --> 41:12.584
He's confused.
He's trying to be a good Samaritan.

41:12.667 --> 41:15.336
You've had more than your share
of loss in life,

41:15.420 --> 41:18.381
and none of us wants to see you
lose your son to outsiders,

41:18.464 --> 41:20.633
but you must speak with him now.

41:20.717 --> 41:24.262
<i>(Joshua) Warn him.
Let him know that the path he is on</i>

41:24.387 --> 41:28.933
can lead only to misery,
not just for himself but for all of you.

41:29.976 --> 41:33.771
There's a group meeting tomorrow.
I thought it might do him good

41:33.855 --> 41:35.898
to come along, get him back on track.

41:35.982 --> 41:40.987
- Could you get him out of school?
- Of course. I'll make sure he's ready.

41:47.201 --> 41:49.912
Well... good night, Mary.

41:59.339 --> 42:03.760
And the Lord must greatly resent
the attempt to pursue a double life

42:03.843 --> 42:06.346
that goes hand in hand with the world

42:06.429 --> 42:10.642
and presuming to be fully brethren
at the same time.

42:10.725 --> 42:12.769
Hear, hear.

42:12.852 --> 42:18.066
God is faithful, who has called us
into the fellowship of his Son.

42:18.232 --> 42:21.944
It works out that way,
instead of being enticed.

42:22.028 --> 42:24.614
God doesn't entice anybody into evil.

42:24.697 --> 42:30.328
We're enticed, led astray,
by our own flesh,

42:30.411 --> 42:33.039
according to the scripture.

See ya!

43:22.880 --> 43:28.511
My father won't send us to your school.
He said the pupils are a bad influence.

43:28.594 --> 43:31.222
Is it true, Brother William?

43:33.099 --> 43:35.184
I suppose so.

Would you like to get down, love?

01:23:57.519 --> 01:24:01.940
My mother wouldn't let me get down till
I'd finished everything on my plate.
