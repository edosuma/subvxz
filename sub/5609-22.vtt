NARRATOR: Previously on
Once Upon A Time...

00:04.254 --> 00:05.710
Hi, m'lady.

00:05.756 --> 00:06.996
I mean, Violet.

00:07.090 --> 00:08.079
(CHUCKLES)

00:13.931 --> 00:15.091
EMMA: I miss you.

00:15.140 --> 00:16.129
-(WHOOSH|NG)
-(GASPS)

00:16.225 --> 00:17.590
HOOK: Swan?

00:17.684 --> 00:18.935
-EMMA: How are you here?
-HOOK: Zeus.

00:19.061 --> 00:20.426
He must have sent me back.
(CHUCKLES)

00:20.562 --> 00:22.018
And this isn't going to kill you.

00:22.105 --> 00:23.845
It's going to end you.

00:23.941 --> 00:24.930
No!

00:27.945 --> 00:29.185
This is my kingdom.

00:53.595 --> 00:55.381
-WOMAN: To Robin!
-To Robin!

01:01.353 --> 01:02.559
Regina?

01:04.231 --> 01:07.439
Look, I know that there's nothing
we can really say,

01:07.526 --> 01:08.891
but we just want you to know

01:10.279 --> 01:12.770
you don't have to go through this alone.

01:12.864 --> 01:14.365
She won't have to.

01:16.493 --> 01:18.609
I think what my sister needs
is a little time with someone

01:18.704 --> 01:20.490
who understands
what she's going through.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.412
DAVID: Zelena, we're sorry.

01:22.499 --> 01:26.993
What happened with Hades, that...
(SIGHS) ...can't exactly be easy.

01:30.632 --> 01:32.338
We'll leave you two alone.

01:44.396 --> 01:45.852
VIOLET: Henry.

01:47.858 --> 01:49.098
Violet.

01:50.402 --> 01:52.063
I'm sorry about Robin.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.322
Thank you.

01:57.367 --> 02:00.530
When I heard
you went to the UndenNorld,

02:00.621 --> 02:03.078
l was afraid I was never
going to see you again.

02:04.583 --> 02:05.698
You were?

02:10.130 --> 02:11.870
Me, too.

02:14.968 --> 02:17.960
When we get to Granny's,
I think it's best if you wait outside.

02:18.055 --> 02:19.886
Aye. Regina...

02:19.973 --> 02:22.510
Robin's death, it can't be easy for her.

02:22.601 --> 02:25.183
And seeing you back
when that's not possible for him?

02:25.896 --> 02:27.636
Fate is cruel.

02:28.482 --> 02:29.892
It could push her over the edge.

02:30.901 --> 02:33.233
She cursed an entire kingdom
when she lost her first love.

02:33.320 --> 02:34.935
Yeah, but she's changed
much since then.

02:35.030 --> 02:36.520
I know.

02:36.615 --> 02:38.731
But I still need to
break the news very carefully.

02:38.825 --> 02:39.860
It's the right thing to do.

02:54.257 --> 02:55.292
Belle...

02:56.176 --> 02:59.885
Since your father refused to wake you,
I'm going to have to find another way.

02:59.971 --> 03:01.051
|Wi||.

03:01.139 --> 03:03.676
It's notjust you
l have to worry about now.

03:04.142 --> 03:06.633
It's our family. Our unborn child.

03:06.728 --> 03:09.435
There's only one way
I can free you both.

03:14.736 --> 03:16.772
I need more power.

03:25.539 --> 03:26.995
(RATTLING)

03:27.290 --> 03:29.076
I need all of it.

03:38.719 --> 03:39.925
(SIGHS) Regina.

03:40.011 --> 03:41.512
REGINA: Emma, please.

03:41.596 --> 03:44.679
I've already had enough people
feeling sorry for me today.

03:44.766 --> 03:46.222
I know.

03:46.309 --> 03:47.845
| just think
we should talk somewhere quiet.

03:47.936 --> 03:49.267
It's kind of delicate.

03:53.400 --> 03:54.389
(RUMBLING)

03:57.028 --> 03:58.689
What the hell was that?

03:59.281 --> 04:01.272
-Swan! Is everything okay?
-(CROWD MUTTERING)

04:02.701 --> 04:03.690
Hook?

04:05.162 --> 04:07.494
ZELENA: What bloody hell's
the pirate doing here?

04:07.622 --> 04:10.159
We thought we left you
in the Unden/vorld.

04:10.292 --> 04:11.657
HOOK: Aye. You did.

04:11.793 --> 04:13.499
But now I'm back.

04:15.172 --> 04:17.504
Delicate as always.

04:17.549 --> 04:18.834
Regina, l...

04:18.884 --> 04:20.374
I'm used to suffering, Swan.

04:20.510 --> 04:23.468
And I'm used to others getting their way.

04:23.513 --> 04:26.129
Right now,
neither one of our feelings matter.

04:26.183 --> 04:28.799
Given that blast of magic,

04:28.852 --> 04:30.467
there's only one person not present

04:30.520 --> 04:33.307
who's powerful enough
for something like that.

04:33.356 --> 04:34.812
ZELENA: Gold.

04:34.858 --> 04:36.849
He's got the Olympian Crystal.

04:36.985 --> 04:38.691
Or part of it, anyway.

04:38.820 --> 04:41.311
Some of it must have survived.

04:41.364 --> 04:43.650
I can still feel the aura from it.

04:43.700 --> 04:46.487
REGINA: Yeah, you're not the only one.

04:46.536 --> 04:49.198
He used it to cast a tethering spell.

04:49.331 --> 04:50.696
Tethering spell?

04:50.832 --> 04:53.323
What was Gold attaching the crystal to?

04:53.376 --> 04:54.707
Storybrooke's magic.

04:55.378 --> 04:57.369
That's why he cast a spell here.

04:57.506 --> 05:01.374
With that crystal, he can harness all of
this town's magic for his own purpose.

05:01.426 --> 05:03.417
Gold already has the power
of all the Dark Ones.

05:03.553 --> 05:05.418
-Why does he need more?
-EMMA: To wake Belle.

05:05.514 --> 05:06.549
True love's kiss didn't work because

05:06.598 --> 05:07.713
she doesn't want to be with him.

05:07.766 --> 05:08.926
Aye.

05:09.059 --> 05:11.846
Once the Crocodile wakes Belle,
do you think he'll stop there?

05:11.895 --> 05:14.386
Do you think
he'll just turn the bloody crystal

05:14.523 --> 05:16.013
and all of its power over to us?

05:16.066 --> 05:17.226
EMMA: He's right.

05:17.442 --> 05:19.433
-Let's go get that crystal.
-REGINA: Let's.

05:19.528 --> 05:21.268
-Where should we start?
-Actually...

05:21.363 --> 05:22.398
Um...

05:22.447 --> 05:25.359
l was thinking
maybe you should sit this one out.

05:25.909 --> 05:28.901
Oh, that's why you were
trying to be delicate with me.

05:29.037 --> 05:31.904
You're worried the Evil Queen
is about to come out to play.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.905
No, | just want what's best for you.

05:34.042 --> 05:35.248
No, you don't.

05:35.377 --> 05:37.743
When you're upset,
we follow you to hell.

05:37.879 --> 05:40.586
But when I'm upset, I get a time-out.

05:40.715 --> 05:42.251
Okay.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.336
(STAMMERS) You're not in any state
to think straight about this.

05:44.427 --> 05:46.554
And you don't get to tell me what to do.

05:46.596 --> 05:47.756
Moms, please...

05:47.806 --> 05:49.262
Henry, now's not the time.

05:49.933 --> 05:53.016
Maybe just take a minute to cool off
and think about it.

05:53.770 --> 05:55.135
You don't want my help?

05:55.272 --> 05:56.432
Fine.

05:57.399 --> 05:58.764
l'll fix this on my own.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.354
(SIGHS)

06:08.076 --> 06:09.111
Kid...

06:09.995 --> 06:13.112
Go to my place and stay there.
You'll be safe. Okay?

06:14.165 --> 06:15.621
We got this.

06:21.840 --> 06:23.125
I mean it, Henry.

06:23.258 --> 06:24.498
Go right home.

06:37.689 --> 06:38.678
(BELLS CHIME)

06:40.191 --> 06:41.317
VIOLET: Henry.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.984
What's going on? I got your text.

06:46.156 --> 06:47.487
It's my grandpa.

06:47.574 --> 06:49.485
He's trying to steal
Storybrooke's magic.

06:49.576 --> 06:51.817
It made me realize how bad it is.

06:51.870 --> 06:54.532
It's always magic. Always.

06:54.664 --> 06:56.996
Magic turned my mom into a Dark One.

06:57.042 --> 06:59.499
It took away the man
my other mom loved.

07:00.211 --> 07:01.542
And now...

07:02.589 --> 07:04.750
Now I think it's going to
tear my parents apart.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.586
I used to think
there was light and dark magic.

07:07.677 --> 07:08.712
But it's all bad.

07:08.845 --> 07:10.676
Look around this shop.

07:14.225 --> 07:16.011
These.

07:16.061 --> 07:17.426
These are Geppetto's parents.

07:19.356 --> 07:20.687
This needle

07:20.774 --> 07:23.857
has put dozens of people
under a curse they can't wake from.

07:25.362 --> 07:26.351
And this.

07:26.446 --> 07:29.188
An entire village is frozen in there.

07:30.533 --> 07:32.524
It's hurt so many people.

07:33.870 --> 07:35.201
My mother.

07:36.581 --> 07:38.117
That's how she died.

07:38.208 --> 07:39.539
Magic.

07:41.711 --> 07:44.043
Come with me. On a road trip.

07:44.089 --> 07:45.454
It's like a quest.

07:45.548 --> 07:46.583
But on a bus.

07:47.217 --> 07:49.833
Which is like a horse
but with wheels and seats.

07:49.886 --> 07:52.719
-Just... Just... Just come with me.
-(CHUCKLES)

07:53.223 --> 07:55.714
What do you say? I think I can fix this.

07:56.226 --> 07:58.262
My father would probably kill me...

08:00.522 --> 08:02.934
But, yes. Of course I'll come.

08:03.066 --> 08:04.055
Great. Great.

08:04.109 --> 08:07.693
-We'll call it Operation Mixtape.
-(CHUCKLES)

08:10.865 --> 08:13.402
There's just one more thing
we're going to need.

08:17.914 --> 08:22.408
I promised I'd never use this pen to do
anything besides record what happens.

08:22.544 --> 08:24.626
But what we're about to do
is for the greater good.

08:37.767 --> 08:38.756
(GASPS)

08:39.728 --> 08:41.468
What's that?

08:41.604 --> 08:43.981
The crystal my grandpa tethered
Storybrooke's magic to.

08:47.610 --> 08:51.319
Wait, I don't understand.
You said magic is bad.

08:51.448 --> 08:53.985
Why are we going to take it
out of Storybrooke?

08:54.117 --> 08:56.153
To destroy it.

08:58.413 --> 08:59.994
Once and for all.

09:06.296 --> 09:07.911
EMMA: So far, no sign of Gold.

09:07.964 --> 09:09.750
Which means we need to
expand our search perimeter

09:09.799 --> 09:11.005
-to include the woods.
-(DOOR OPENS)

09:11.843 --> 09:13.174
Where is he?

09:13.303 --> 09:15.259
I told you we got this. We'll find Gold.

09:15.305 --> 09:17.011
(SIGHS) Not Gold. Henry.

09:18.433 --> 09:21.800
"Mom, there's only one way to fix
everything that's tearing us apart.

09:21.895 --> 09:22.884
"I have to destroy the..."

09:22.979 --> 09:23.968
"The source of all of our problems."

09:24.105 --> 09:25.265
I got the same text.

09:25.315 --> 09:26.304
What does he mean?

09:26.441 --> 09:28.807
What is the source of all our problems?
What is he going to destroy?

09:31.321 --> 09:33.482
Well, I think I can answer that.

09:34.824 --> 09:37.361
The Olympian Crystal
and all the magic tethered to it.

09:39.037 --> 09:41.779
It would appear
my grandson has outsmarted us all.

09:41.831 --> 09:43.662
He used his Authorial power

09:43.708 --> 09:46.324
to steal the crystal
right out from under my nose.

09:46.461 --> 09:48.372
Would Henry even do that?
Destroy magic?

09:49.005 --> 09:50.996
We better hope he doesn't.

09:51.049 --> 09:52.164
REGINA: Why?

09:52.217 --> 09:54.458
What happens if Henry succeeds?

09:54.511 --> 09:56.843
Considering this town
was built with magic,

09:56.971 --> 09:58.302
what do you think will happen?

09:58.807 --> 10:01.014
He would never destroy magic
if he knew it could hurt us.

10:01.059 --> 10:03.471
I'll be sure to tell him that
right before I take the crystal back.

10:03.520 --> 10:05.385
Don't you dare go near my son.

10:05.522 --> 10:06.557
Sorry, dearie.

10:06.689 --> 10:08.520
But he's threatening me now.

10:13.404 --> 10:14.814
Regina, where are you going?

10:14.906 --> 10:17.363
ljust lost Robin.
I'm not about to lose Henry, too.

10:17.408 --> 10:19.023
I know.
But we have to be smart about this.

10:19.077 --> 10:21.363
Gold doesn't know where Henry is
any more than we do.

10:22.205 --> 10:23.240
”We”?

10:24.165 --> 10:26.827
I don't remember
inviting you to come along.

10:27.168 --> 10:28.749
You benched me.

10:28.878 --> 10:30.539
Now I bench you.

10:31.172 --> 10:33.037
Even ifl knew how to find Henry?

10:36.553 --> 10:39.590
All right, Sheriff Swan.

10:39.722 --> 10:40.711
Where is he?

10:40.765 --> 10:42.380
You think after all those times
he ran away,

10:42.517 --> 10:44.348
I wouldn't put
a GPS app on his phone?

10:45.061 --> 10:47.052
Let's get to the bug.
We have to catch up to him.

10:47.188 --> 10:48.177
Where's he headed?

10:49.232 --> 10:50.472
Boston.

11:00.285 --> 11:02.196
MERIDA:
Is it true magic might disappear?

11:02.245 --> 11:04.076
Only if Henry destroys the crystal.

11:04.205 --> 11:06.537
Which he won't. Not with Emma
and Regina searching for him.

11:06.583 --> 11:08.119
Yeah, but what if
they don't find him in time?

11:08.251 --> 11:09.411
How are we gonna
get back without magic?

11:09.460 --> 11:12.543
It won't be a problem
if we send you home now.

11:12.589 --> 11:14.250
We?

11:14.382 --> 11:16.293
I think you mean me, dear.

11:16.426 --> 11:18.132
But this time,
summon the portal without the twister.

11:19.053 --> 11:21.260
You heroes ruin all the fun.

11:21.306 --> 11:22.637
Very well.

11:33.943 --> 11:35.899
REGINA: He wasn't on the bus?

11:35.945 --> 11:37.606
Lady, I don't know what to tell you.
Everyone got off.

11:37.739 --> 11:39.821
Then why does the GPS tracker
still say he's on it?

11:39.949 --> 11:41.655
Because Henry hid his phone
under one of the seats.

11:41.784 --> 11:43.820
He wanted us to think
he came to Boston.

11:43.953 --> 11:45.614
Ladies, if you don't mind, it's my lunch.

11:46.831 --> 11:47.946
Got any more bright ideas?

11:47.999 --> 11:49.364
-Regina...
-(CELLPHONE IMPACTS)

11:50.585 --> 11:52.621
Well, that's new.

11:53.421 --> 11:55.286
How is that even possible?
We're in a land without magic.

11:56.132 --> 11:59.420
And so is Henry. With the crystal.

11:59.469 --> 12:01.084
And all of the magic from Storybrooke.

12:04.182 --> 12:08.175
Regina, if our magic works out here,
Gold's magic works out here.

12:08.311 --> 12:10.142
We've got to find Henry before he does.

12:10.230 --> 12:13.313
Well, if he's not in Boston,

12:13.399 --> 12:15.139
then where is he?

12:29.749 --> 12:32.616
I thought
the spires of Camelot were tall.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.367
Welcome to New York City.

12:34.671 --> 12:35.660
(LAUGHS)

12:41.010 --> 12:44.173
Are you sure Regina won't mind
us leaving without a goodbye?

12:45.932 --> 12:47.638
She'll understand.

12:47.684 --> 12:50.596
Robin would want him
to grow up in ShenNood Forest.

12:50.687 --> 12:53.019
We'll come and visit you soon, okay?

12:53.106 --> 12:54.767
And we'll even bring your baby sister.

12:55.525 --> 12:56.856
(BABY MOANS)

13:06.911 --> 13:08.572
For Regina.

13:10.707 --> 13:12.868
From one of my papa's arrows.

13:14.502 --> 13:15.537
How sweet.

13:16.379 --> 13:17.459
She'll cherish it.

13:32.228 --> 13:33.468
That's everyone.

Stand back!

13:50.163 --> 13:51.198
DAVID: Zelena!

13:51.914 --> 13:55.702
It must have something to do with
magic being tied to that bloody crystal!

14:06.929 --> 14:08.009

14:14.395 --> 14:15.851
Everyone okay?

HOOK: For now.

14:18.524 --> 14:19.559
Look.

14:31.537 --> 14:33.619
Well, we're certainly
not in Storybrooke anymore.

14:42.632 --> 14:45.089
Assuming you have a map somewhere
in this pigsty of yours.

14:45.134 --> 14:46.590
The glove box.

14:46.636 --> 14:49.628
By the way, it was your idea
to go to Hardy's.

14:51.307 --> 14:53.218
Give me your hand.

14:53.309 --> 14:54.924
Why? What is that?

14:54.977 --> 14:56.057
What?

14:56.145 --> 14:58.978
Worried I might make you
take an eternal nap on a bus bench?

15:01.067 --> 15:04.605
If you want to help Henry,
you're just going to have to trust me.

15:09.492 --> 15:10.481
Ow!

15:10.576 --> 15:13.739
Now that there's magic in the world,
this just might work.

15:14.789 --> 15:18.657
And if it does,
you're going to lead us right to him.

15:28.302 --> 15:29.963
EMMA: Of course. New York.

15:30.513 --> 15:32.003
I hope Gold doesn't know that yet.

15:47.613 --> 15:50.104
Welcome to New York. It'll be $15.

16:07.008 --> 16:09.670
VIOLET: I can't imagine living here.

16:09.719 --> 16:11.630
It's oven/vhelming.

16:11.721 --> 16:14.337
I thought the same thing
when I first went to Camelot.

16:14.390 --> 16:16.221
Until you showed me around.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.552
Well, Iwant to see this place, Henry.

16:20.646 --> 16:21.897
Truly, but...

16:22.857 --> 16:26.020
But what does it have to do
with destroying magic?

16:26.068 --> 16:27.729
It's got to do with my dad.

16:28.529 --> 16:30.235
Magic tore apart his family, too,

16:30.323 --> 16:32.530
when my grandpa
became the Dark One.

16:32.617 --> 16:34.824
VIOLET: And did he want to
destroy magic, too?

16:34.911 --> 16:38.403
HENRY: The truth is,
for a really long time.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.580
No one else knows this.
Not even my moms.

16:40.666 --> 16:43.624
He made me promise not to tell anyone.

16:43.711 --> 16:46.999
It's safe with me, I promise.

16:47.089 --> 16:48.374
See, that's why he was in New York.

16:48.466 --> 16:50.548
He was trying to find a way
to protect himself

16:50.635 --> 16:52.250
in case his dad found him.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.586
Right, and he thought
the best way of doing that

16:54.680 --> 16:56.511
was by destroying magic.

16:57.725 --> 17:00.216
Did he ever figure it out?

17:00.311 --> 17:01.847
He died before he could.

17:01.938 --> 17:03.769
But I know he got close.

17:03.898 --> 17:05.388
He kept everything he found
in a journal.

17:05.483 --> 17:08.190
It's got to be in my dad's apartment.
Come on.

17:09.820 --> 17:13.779
MARY: If this isn't Storybrooke or the
enchanted forest, then where are we?

17:13.866 --> 17:16.653
Wherever we are, I'd rather not
stick around long enough to find out.

17:16.744 --> 17:20.032
Can you use the wand
and get us back to Storybrooke?

17:20.122 --> 17:21.373
Not quite.

17:21.457 --> 17:23.118
HOOK: So we're trapped
in this mysterious realm,

17:23.209 --> 17:24.574
wherever it is.

17:24.669 --> 17:25.784
You can fix it, right?

17:25.878 --> 17:26.867
Of course.

17:26.963 --> 17:29.079
Do you happen to have any duct tape?

17:29.173 --> 17:31.710
We're not affixing the bumper
to that God-awful truck of yours.

17:31.801 --> 17:34.167
This requires the proper potions.

17:34.262 --> 17:35.251
None of which I have with me.

17:35.346 --> 17:37.052
Well, then, we're just gonna
have to go find them.

ZELENA: Then we'll have
to move quickly.

17:38.641 --> 17:41.724
If we don't find Regina and Emma
before Henry destroys magic,

17:41.811 --> 17:43.676
fixing this wand won't matter.

17:43.771 --> 17:45.227
We'll be cut off
from Storybrooke for good.

We just want to know
what land we're in.

I'm not supposed to talk to strangers.

18:10.214 --> 18:11.499
You don't need to be afraid of us.

18:11.591 --> 18:14.708
No, you don't understand.
You shouldn't be here. You have to go.

18:14.802 --> 18:17.760
Well, that's what we want to do.
We're trying to get home to our families.

18:17.847 --> 18:19.428
To a town called Storybrooke.

18:19.515 --> 18:21.756
That's a strange name.

18:21.851 --> 18:23.807
We need magic to get back there.

18:23.894 --> 18:24.929
Can you help us?

18:25.021 --> 18:27.728
Magic? No, no, no.

what that Groundsman was so afraid of.

18:58.554 --> 19:00.294
This isn't like any dungeon
I've ever seen.

19:02.016 --> 19:03.426
These bars are enchanted.

19:04.518 --> 19:05.849

-Not like this is any use to us in here.

No, no, no, we didn't attack anyone.

19:29.251 --> 19:30.866
This is just a big misunderstanding.

19:30.961 --> 19:33.122
We just want to know where we are.

is that you don't want to be here.

And that you're the ones who are
going to be answering my questions.

But killing him
isn't going to change the truth.

Which is that
we don't work for Rumplestiltskin.

20:26.392 --> 20:28.383
He's our enemy.

20:28.477 --> 20:29.808
He's the whole reason we're here.

So, whatever grudge
you have against him,

20:45.578 --> 20:48.115
we have nothing to do with it.

Let us go,

20:49.540 --> 20:51.496
and you won't have to
worry about us ever again.

20:53.210 --> 20:55.075
In my experience,

20:55.171 --> 20:57.127
if you really don't want
to worry about something,

20:57.214 --> 20:59.125
you lock it into a cage.

20:59.216 --> 21:02.424
A strong cage. Like this one.

21:02.511 --> 21:04.718
It's when you unlock the cage...

21:07.933 --> 21:10.140
That's when the trouble starts.

21:15.816 --> 21:17.101
EMMA: Looks like Henry was here.

21:17.193 --> 21:18.854
But I don't think he was alone.

21:19.612 --> 21:22.194
This is Henry and Violet's song.

21:23.282 --> 21:24.317
They have a song?

21:24.408 --> 21:26.990
He really likes her. She's a nice girl.

21:27.411 --> 21:28.491
You're just saying that because

21:28.579 --> 21:31.286
you feel bad about
ripping her heart out in Camelot.

21:31.373 --> 21:34.536
I'll like her a lot better
when I know where she's taken my son.

21:35.044 --> 21:37.706
Well, I think I might be able
to figure that out.

21:39.673 --> 21:41.379
Yes, he has definitely been here.

21:41.467 --> 21:43.298
He tried to
wipe the search history clean.

21:43.385 --> 21:45.421
But luckily,

21:47.056 --> 21:48.717
I won't hold my breath.

21:50.601 --> 21:53.934
Maybe there's something else in here
that can tell us where they've gone.

22:01.570 --> 22:02.650
Did you find something?

22:02.738 --> 22:04.569
REGINA: One of Robin's books.

22:10.496 --> 22:14.114
He must have brought it with him
from Storybrooke when he came here.

22:16.085 --> 22:18.246
I know because I gave it to him.

22:18.796 --> 22:23.005
(CHUCKLES) It's a collection of this
world's legends about Robin Hood.

22:26.929 --> 22:29.261
He used to laugh
at everything they got wrong.

22:33.394 --> 22:36.181
What is it? Are you okay?

22:36.272 --> 22:38.809
It's a letter from Robin to me.

22:38.899 --> 22:40.309
He must have written it
when he was trying to

22:40.401 --> 22:41.481
make things work with Marian.

22:41.569 --> 22:43.400
Or your sister.

22:43.487 --> 22:44.647
So, what do I do?

22:45.614 --> 22:46.990
You have to read it.

22:58.752 --> 23:00.492
ROBIN HOOD: My dear Regina,

23:00.588 --> 23:02.579
/ know / shouldn’t be writing this.

23:02.673 --> 23:05.756
But / had to let you know
how proud / am of you.

23:05.843 --> 23:09.210
You opened your heart to love
and let it change you.

23:09.305 --> 23:11.045
And no matter what separates us,

23:11.140 --> 23:14.098
/ know you’ll always be
the heroine woman / fell in love with.

23:14.184 --> 23:15.264
Robin.

23:16.228 --> 23:19.220
EMMA: Regina? Are you okay?
What did it say?

23:19.315 --> 23:22.022
Please, Emma, if you're going to try
to make me feel better, don't.

23:22.109 --> 23:24.350
No, I know that I can't. And Iwon't.

23:25.738 --> 23:26.773
I'm...

23:28.490 --> 23:30.151
Sorry about earlier.

23:30.784 --> 23:34.368
I was so wrapped up worrying about
how you'd react to Hook, I...

23:35.414 --> 23:37.496
I wasn't there for you about Robin.

23:41.837 --> 23:43.668
You wanna know why I got so angry?

23:45.883 --> 23:47.373
Because you're right.

23:48.427 --> 23:52.466
The Evil Queen is inside me.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.798
Always trying to get out.

24:00.940 --> 24:03.682
Well, I fought the darkness.

24:03.776 --> 24:05.232
You know I do understand.

24:05.319 --> 24:08.026
All due respect, but you don't.

24:10.074 --> 24:11.939
You went up to the precipice.

24:12.952 --> 24:17.241
But you got pulled back
before it consumed you.

24:17.331 --> 24:20.164
I was consumed.

24:20.250 --> 24:22.377
And I have to live with it every day.

24:22.461 --> 24:24.326
I can't imagine how that feels.

24:24.421 --> 24:26.002
It's exhausting.

24:26.632 --> 24:28.873
I'm constantly at war with my instincts.

24:29.760 --> 24:30.966
Like, With Hook,

24:33.013 --> 24:37.177
my first impulse was to rip his throat out

24:38.852 --> 24:42.640
because it's not fair
that he survives and Robin doesn't.

24:43.983 --> 24:45.018
But I didn't.

24:47.111 --> 24:49.193
Because now I know that's wrong.

24:50.614 --> 24:53.230
Much as I want to give in to evil,
I don't.

24:54.201 --> 24:55.702
So, I do good.

24:57.621 --> 24:59.532
And hate every moment of it.

24:59.623 --> 25:01.705
-You hate doing good?
-(SIGHS) Yes.

25:03.377 --> 25:04.992
It's complicated.

25:06.672 --> 25:09.914
I know it's right,
but it always leads to loss for me.

25:11.385 --> 25:14.377
Yet I keep doing it now,
and I keep suffering.

25:15.973 --> 25:18.305
But I know the Evil Queen can't return,

25:18.392 --> 25:20.553
so, that's how it has to be.

25:21.770 --> 25:23.977
I'll never be at peace with myself.

25:24.064 --> 25:25.270
That's not true.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.222
You fell in love with Robin,
and you were happy...

25:27.317 --> 25:28.932
Yeah, and look what happened.

25:29.028 --> 25:31.690
I am what I am.

25:31.780 --> 25:33.736
I did What I did.

25:35.284 --> 25:37.525
Many years ago, I had a choice.

25:40.247 --> 25:42.408
Snow White told a secret.

25:43.459 --> 25:45.791
And I could have chosen to forgive her.

25:45.878 --> 25:49.086
Instead, I did terrible things.

25:51.300 --> 25:53.006
Unspeakable things.

25:56.597 --> 25:58.963
That will always hang over me.

26:03.103 --> 26:04.843
I've tried to be the hero.

26:07.691 --> 26:09.272
And you have been.

26:09.359 --> 26:10.769
But it doesn't matter.

26:10.861 --> 26:13.068
There is no redemption for me.

26:13.155 --> 26:14.816
There is only suffering.

26:14.907 --> 26:17.740
Because now I have a curse.

26:19.703 --> 26:22.194
The curse of knowing
the difference between good and evil.

26:22.289 --> 26:24.746
And I'm caught between them.

26:24.833 --> 26:27.370
If I revert, I lose everyone I love.

26:29.755 --> 26:30.835
Henry...

26:32.633 --> 26:33.713
My friends...

26:35.511 --> 26:37.502
Everyone.

26:37.596 --> 26:40.804
And if I go fonrvard trying to be good,

26:42.559 --> 26:44.891
I have to live with my past darkness

26:44.978 --> 26:47.765
and all its well-deserved consequences.

26:49.525 --> 26:50.890
I don't believe that.

26:53.529 --> 26:55.065
I believe in you.

26:57.032 --> 26:58.272
That's because

27:00.327 --> 27:01.362
you are good.

27:01.453 --> 27:05.116
But for me, it's a simple choice, really.

27:05.207 --> 27:07.118
I'd rather suffer

27:07.209 --> 27:10.292
than see that pain
on the people I care about.

27:13.048 --> 27:14.458
This is my fate.

27:17.636 --> 27:18.671
I'm trapped.

27:19.972 --> 27:21.303
(COMPUTER BEEPS)

27:31.942 --> 27:33.352
He's at the Midtown Library.

27:34.486 --> 27:36.067
REGINA: What are they doing there?

27:42.619 --> 27:45.736
WOMAN: You want to go to
the Rare Reading Room? Really?

27:48.375 --> 27:50.616
Well, here we are.

27:51.712 --> 27:54.044
No one's been back here in ages.

27:54.131 --> 27:55.917
-Most folks just come for the YA stuff.
-(CHUCKLES)

27:56.258 --> 27:58.123
Well, good luck with your term paper.

28:01.388 --> 28:03.504
HENRY: My dad's journal said
he had an appointment here.

28:03.599 --> 28:07.968
Whatever he was looking for
to destroy magic must be in this room.

28:11.607 --> 28:12.642
Start with these.

28:12.733 --> 28:14.769
Read every page, and then re-read it,

28:14.860 --> 28:16.566
because whatever my dad
was looking for,

28:16.653 --> 28:18.234
he never found it.

28:18.989 --> 28:20.854
And you really think we can?

28:20.949 --> 28:22.325
We have to.

28:30.167 --> 28:31.953
That's impossible.

28:33.253 --> 28:34.629
Henry? What did you find?

28:34.671 --> 28:37.663
HENRY: These books, they all look
exactly like my storybook.

28:37.966 --> 28:40.708
They're magic.
What are they doing in New York?

28:44.306 --> 28:47.673
I've never seen these characters
in my book.

28:47.768 --> 28:51.352
Look at this. There are so many stories.

28:53.148 --> 28:56.356
But, Henry, you told me that
all the stories in your book are real.

28:56.443 --> 28:57.432
Yeah.

28:58.987 --> 29:00.363
So, maybe...

29:02.783 --> 29:04.648
These are all real, too.

29:13.794 --> 29:15.034
Aye.

29:15.128 --> 29:17.119
Bloody fantastic.

Other than that,

29:19.800 --> 29:22.291

manages to get in my way.

29:23.470 --> 29:25.586
What the devil do you think
he did to that Warden?

29:25.681 --> 29:27.296
With him, it could be anything.

Let's do this.

There you are.

30:01.466 --> 30:02.751
What are you doing here?

30:03.802 --> 30:05.963
What does it look like?
I'm here to help you.

30:06.054 --> 30:08.170
Help us?
Last time you wouldn't even talk to us.

30:08.265 --> 30:11.007
That's because
the Warden was watching me.

30:11.101 --> 30:12.181
I had no choice.

30:12.269 --> 30:14.134
HOOK: If you really wanna help us,
prove it.

30:14.229 --> 30:15.765
Open those bloody bars.

30:15.856 --> 30:17.016
I can't.

30:17.107 --> 30:19.723
His orderly, Poole,
keeps the key with him at all times.

30:19.818 --> 30:22.150
I might be able to
get the magic you need,

30:22.863 --> 30:24.319
if you'll make a promise to me first.

30:24.406 --> 30:25.987
Tell us. Anything.

30:26.074 --> 30:28.611
When you leave this place,

30:28.702 --> 30:31.239
promise you'll take me with you
back to your home.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.446
To Storybrooke? Why?

30:33.540 --> 30:37.374
Because I wasn't always
the gardener here.

30:37.461 --> 30:39.998
I was a doctor,

30:40.088 --> 30:43.797
before the Warden took control
and ruined everything.

30:43.884 --> 30:46.170
He made me a prisoner.

30:46.261 --> 30:49.799
Look. We need magic
so I can fix this wand.

30:49.890 --> 30:51.005
I know exactly where to go.

30:51.099 --> 30:53.511
The hospital lab.

30:53.602 --> 30:57.470
But I can't take anything without
the Warden knowing that it's missing.

30:57.564 --> 30:59.475
You'll have to give the pieces to me
so I can fix it there.

30:59.566 --> 31:00.681
Then I'll bring it back.

31:01.860 --> 31:06.069
Please understand.
That wand is our only way home.

31:06.156 --> 31:08.613
Okay? So why should we trust you?

31:09.951 --> 31:12.078
You've met the Warden.

31:12.162 --> 31:14.778
Trust me, Iwant to get away from him
as much as you do.

31:15.415 --> 31:16.951
This is a bad plan.

31:18.335 --> 31:19.871
It's the only one we've got.

31:37.020 --> 31:38.726
HENRY: Now I see why my dad gave up.

31:38.814 --> 31:41.476
There's nothing in here
about destroying magic.

31:44.152 --> 31:47.144
We came all this way for nothing.

31:51.827 --> 31:53.738
Not for nothing.

31:54.454 --> 31:55.955
You'll figure it out.

32:01.670 --> 32:02.705
Henry.

32:03.296 --> 32:05.503
Henry, I know why your dad
never finished his quest.

32:05.590 --> 32:07.296
It's because he never visited Camelot.

32:08.427 --> 32:09.633
Back in Camelot,

32:09.719 --> 32:12.131
my tutor used to show me
paintings of the Holy Grail.

32:12.222 --> 32:13.837
He said it was the source of all magic.

32:13.932 --> 32:16.298
And it looked just like that.

32:18.311 --> 32:20.563
But the Grail turned into Excalibur.
That can't be it.

32:20.647 --> 32:23.480
No. The Grail was always silver.

32:23.567 --> 32:27.731
But this looks kind of like its twin.

32:27.821 --> 32:30.733
And if the Grail really was
the beginning of all magic...

32:31.658 --> 32:33.774
-This might be the end of it.
-Yeah.

32:33.869 --> 32:35.154

32:41.710 --> 32:42.699

You were right.

32:56.683 --> 32:57.718
(GASPS)

32:57.767 --> 32:59.223
This will destroy magic.

32:59.311 --> 33:02.053
So what we do now?
What happens next?

33:02.147 --> 33:04.604
Whatever it is, it's not safe to do here.

33:14.326 --> 33:15.907

34:55.802 --> 34:58.134
It's a surgical instrument.

Well, if that's true, you won't mind me
asking the Warden himself.

35:00.724 --> 35:02.840
No. You can't do that.

he got from the prisoners.

36:00.492 --> 36:02.357
And so you did this?

36:03.119 --> 36:05.986
The doctor was running away.
I had no choice.

The doctor hasn't been brave enough
to come down here for quite some time.

36:33.733 --> 36:37.021
He must think
that these prisoners can help him.

36:38.488 --> 36:40.570
Should we kill 'em? Just to be safe?

36:42.867 --> 36:44.732
I would be happy to do it.

36:44.828 --> 36:47.535
Hmm, yes, I'm sure you would be.

36:47.622 --> 36:49.658
The fact is that the doctor
is on to something.

36:49.749 --> 36:53.867
This place that they told him about,
this Storybrooke...

36:55.296 --> 36:57.708
It could be the answer we're looking for.

37:00.176 --> 37:02.292
You mean it?

37:02.387 --> 37:04.719
You think this could be the place?

37:04.806 --> 37:08.390
I think that we have been trapped
in this land for far too long.

37:08.476 --> 37:10.967
It's time that
we found ourselves a home.

37:12.063 --> 37:13.769
And so,

37:13.857 --> 37:16.439
I shall allow the doctor
to go through with his plan,

37:16.526 --> 37:20.940
but I'm going to
make one small alteration.

37:21.030 --> 37:26.366
The doctor isn't the only one
who will be going to this Storybrooke.

37:28.663 --> 37:30.369
We all will.

37:58.026 --> 37:59.982
Henry! Are you okay?

38:01.279 --> 38:03.361

38:03.490 --> 38:06.527
I'm right here. I'm all right.

38:06.618 --> 38:08.199

38:14.542 --> 38:16.498
Why would you try to destroy magic?

38:16.544 --> 38:18.830
Do you really have to ask me that?

38:20.215 --> 38:22.547
You finally had a chance to be happy.

38:22.634 --> 38:26.047
And then magic took it away from you.
Just like with Daniel.

38:26.137 --> 38:28.048
Henry...

38:28.139 --> 38:31.222
The Evil Queen is never coming back.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.015
You don't have to worry about me.

38:33.061 --> 38:34.301
I don't.

38:34.395 --> 38:36.386
Because my other mom
is doing that for me.

38:36.481 --> 38:39.143
You thought she was gonna
go all Evil Queen again.

38:39.234 --> 38:41.566
I'm sorry. I should have trusted Regina.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.644
But you didn't!

we could be happy,

38:54.415 --> 38:55.541
Yeah.

38:55.583 --> 38:59.417
In case you both forgot,
magic took away my dad.

39:00.213 --> 39:01.749
And it took away Violet's mom.

39:03.049 --> 39:06.212
And I don't know what I would do

39:07.011 --> 39:08.922
if it took away one of you.

39:09.055 --> 39:10.841
-Henry...
-Don't!

39:10.932 --> 39:12.513
Just don't.

Henry, what were you
doing down here?

39:18.439 --> 39:21.351
Following my dad's trail
to figure out how to destroy magic.

39:23.945 --> 39:26.277
But we didn't find anything.

39:26.406 --> 39:28.271
It was just a waste of time.

39:30.535 --> 39:31.945
So, what do we do now?

39:32.787 --> 39:34.698
Because Henry's grandpa
has the crystal.

39:37.542 --> 39:39.248

39:43.548 --> 39:44.958
Give me your hand.

Is this really going to help find him?

39:46.467 --> 39:48.924

if he's still in New York.

39:59.772 --> 40:01.103
Why isn't it working?

40:01.149 --> 40:04.437
Our magic. It's gone.

40:04.819 --> 40:07.652
The crystal. Gold must have
done something to it.

40:09.782 --> 40:12.114
REGINA: What the hell is he doing?

40:14.287 --> 40:15.823
He's not going to
give that magic back to anyone.

40:18.833 --> 40:20.789
He ’3 going to keep it all for himself.

40:22.754 --> 40:25.416
We're going to have to do it
the old-fashioned way.

Then what are we doing?

40:51.866 --> 40:56.701
Taking something
that will give us the power we need.

42:01.728 --> 42:03.844
How is this box
going to help us find a home?

42:03.938 --> 42:07.305
It's not the box that's important,
it's what's inside it.

42:09.569 --> 42:11.230
Or, rather, who.

42:12.530 --> 42:17.240

ever wishes to see his wife again,

That's the thing about you, Hyde.
You're not half as clever as you think.

43:13.299 --> 43:14.584
Did you get into your own rum?

43:16.010 --> 43:17.966
You think that's going to work
when my magic can't?

43:18.012 --> 43:20.503
Well, I suppose I can just do nothing.
But then again, that's yourjob!

43:20.598 --> 43:21.804
If you really want to get out of here,

43:21.849 --> 43:23.510
I can arrange a trip
right back to the Undenivorld!

43:23.601 --> 43:25.842
Stop it! Now, we need to be patient.

43:25.937 --> 43:29.179
The Groundsman promised to fix
the wand and bring it back to us.

43:29.315 --> 43:31.852
Unfortunately, I was only able to
keep half my promise.

43:31.984 --> 43:34.270
What do you mean?
Where's the wand?

43:34.362 --> 43:37.354
I repaired it, but then
the Warden took it from me.

43:38.157 --> 43:39.317
I didn't come empty-handed, though.

43:39.367 --> 43:42.985
Seems the Orderly, he enjoyed
a little bit too much whiskey today.

43:43.162 --> 43:44.663
We need to get that wand back
from that Warden.

43:44.705 --> 43:45.785
Do you know where he is?

43:47.041 --> 43:49.532
Uh, no. But first things first.

43:49.627 --> 43:52.039
Before we find him,
we must have a way to defeat him.

43:52.797 --> 43:54.628
He's quite powerful,
although I might have a way.

43:55.800 --> 43:56.835
But it is dangerous.

43:56.968 --> 43:58.879
Hasn't stopped us before.

44:01.639 --> 44:05.723
I just went to Hell and back,
I'm not afraid of your Warden.

MARY: Forced to flee from what?

44:38.259 --> 44:39.874
DR. JEKYLL: The reasons are
as varied as the populace.

44:39.927 --> 44:41.428
Everyone has their own tale.

44:41.554 --> 44:45.046
That's why this place has come to be
known as the Land of Untold Stories.

44:45.099 --> 44:46.760
HOOK: It's a tad ironic of a name, no?

44:46.893 --> 44:49.600
Given that this land is
seemingly filled with stories.

44:49.687 --> 44:51.018
Perhaps. But there's only one story

44:51.105 --> 44:52.936
we need to worry about right now,
that's our own.

44:53.065 --> 44:56.398
HOOK: Right, and that story better end
with us getting back to our world.

45:07.872 --> 45:11.035
Henry. Henry, will you stop?

45:11.125 --> 45:12.786
Your moms told us
to wait back in the library.

45:12.919 --> 45:15.626
They could be in trouble. And
since when do you care what they say?

45:15.755 --> 45:17.791
You already ran away with me.
You lied about the dark grail.

45:21.594 --> 45:23.380
I know you're scared.

And if you really think this is
the best thing to do, I'll help you.

45:29.268 --> 45:31.099
Thank you.

45:32.146 --> 45:34.558
But I hope you have a good plan.

If I know Henry,
he's already disobeyed us.

47:53.079 --> 47:54.194
We should call and tell him to stay put.

-What's wrong?

48:00.920 --> 48:03.787
It's Granny.
Something's happened in Storybrooke.

48:03.881 --> 48:06.543
My parents, Hook and your sister were
pulled through some kind of portal.

48:06.634 --> 48:08.841

48:08.928 --> 48:10.919
Granny's an expert on lasagna,
not magic.

48:11.013 --> 48:13.174
All she says is that they vanished
with the Sorcerer's wand

48:13.265 --> 48:14.971
and never came back.

48:22.149 --> 48:24.185
They might all be in danger.
We have to bring them home.

48:24.276 --> 48:26.403
Well, the only way to do that is
to get our magic back from Gold.

48:26.487 --> 48:27.727
What are you doing? We need a plan.

48:27.822 --> 48:31.986

Gold still has a nose.

I have any interest in talking to you?

tell me you haven't been able to
wake Belle yet.

49:01.397 --> 49:03.888
And apparently,
it's not from a lack of trying.

49:05.151 --> 49:08.188

use the help of your best student.

tasteful cotton and good intentions.

I was ready to let her back out?

What if I told you I am sick
of losing everyone I care about?

49:28.340 --> 49:29.955
Well, I'd say, "What's changed?"

49:31.802 --> 49:35.420
Zelena. She's in trouble.

All because the heroes convinced her
to use the Sorcerer's wand.

in another realm.

I would ever help Zelena?

one more person I love.

to Robin Hood.

50:05.669 --> 50:07.170

Now, let's talk about finding your sister.

still a doctor at the hospital.

50:25.689 --> 50:27.725
So, not many maids
with untold stories then?

50:32.112 --> 50:34.273

-A serum I created.

the good from the evil in someone.

to defeat the Warden.

see any good in him.

to get out for a long time.

trimming back in the garden.

If only he knew I was growing it
right under his nose.

51:10.609 --> 51:12.395
Actually, he did. Back off!

51:14.113 --> 51:15.853
I don't understand.
You were passed out drunk!

so you could finish your serum.

52:21.305 --> 52:23.796
Speaking of... Where is Belle?

52:24.642 --> 52:28.760
She was taken. Or rather,
Pandora's Box was taken with her in it.

52:29.688 --> 52:30.723
How?

52:30.814 --> 52:32.679
GOLD: I didn't know how
until you arrived.

52:32.775 --> 52:34.686
It was the Sorcerer's wand.

52:34.777 --> 52:37.860
Zelena must be trapped because
someone's taken it from her.

52:37.946 --> 52:40.904
Which means
they're both in the same realm.

52:40.991 --> 52:41.980
And you?

52:42.868 --> 52:46.156
Well, you're going to help me find it,

-You knew.
-Of course I knew.

53:04.014 --> 53:05.675
You've changed, Regina.

53:06.975 --> 53:11.890
The loss of one man isn't gonna push
you back over the edge. Not anymore.

For better or worse,
this is now who you are.

53:18.070 --> 53:21.107

No, you risked everything to save us.

56:46.945 --> 56:47.980
We had to do the same.

56:48.071 --> 56:49.527
To be clear, I was fine running.

56:49.615 --> 56:51.776
Now I'm going to kill you all.

Leave it. It's of no use to us now.

And we don't want to be here
when he wakes up.

57:05.422 --> 57:07.287
Have you any idea
what you've just done?

57:07.466 --> 57:10.128
Stopped you from hurting my moms.
And anybody else.

57:10.177 --> 57:12.008
You stopped me from rescuing Belle.

Not to mention your family who are now
trapped in the same realm with her.

are in another realm right now.

And thanks to you, we have no way
of helping them get back.

This isn't on me, it's on you!

57:44.127 --> 57:45.788
I'm sure it can manage a few more.

57:45.879 --> 57:47.039
You said it would be destroyed!

57:47.130 --> 57:50.167
Yes. When I had to motivate you
to find your wayward son.

57:50.258 --> 57:52.123
What should we do? Call the police?

57:52.219 --> 57:53.925
See how he does without his powers
in a real prison?

57:54.012 --> 57:55.172
That's an excellent idea.

57:55.347 --> 57:58.589
Not if you want my help finding the one
person who may still have magic.

57:58.684 --> 58:01.141
What are you talking about?
You said this was a land without magic.

58:01.228 --> 58:03.139
It is. And it isn't.

58:04.022 --> 58:06.013
Enough with the riddles.
Who has magic?

58:06.108 --> 58:07.393
Well, for that answer, it looks like

58:07.484 --> 58:09.395
we're just gonna have to learn
to work together now.

58:10.070 --> 58:11.105
(SIGHS)

58:11.196 --> 58:14.154
I'll go with Gold and make sure
he keeps his hands off this crystal.

58:14.241 --> 58:15.481
You find Henry.

58:15.659 --> 58:16.648
(SIGHS)

58:25.168 --> 58:27.750
-Hey. Could we have a second?
-Of course.

58:33.135 --> 58:34.591
How'd you know where to find me?

58:34.678 --> 58:35.963
Because when we lived in New York,

58:36.054 --> 58:37.885
this was where we came
when you were upset.

58:37.973 --> 58:40.931
I'd give you a penny and tell you
to wish your problems away.

58:41.018 --> 58:42.224
Remember?

58:42.310 --> 58:45.268
What do you say? Wanna give it a try?

58:45.355 --> 58:48.222
I'm sorry, Mom, but that's not
going to make me feel better now.

58:48.275 --> 58:49.264
Why not?

58:49.359 --> 58:51.020
When we lived here,

58:51.111 --> 58:53.227
there wasn't any magic.

58:53.321 --> 58:56.233
We didn't even know it existed.
And, Mom, we were happy.

58:58.785 --> 59:00.400
We were.

59:00.495 --> 59:03.453
And I wouldn't trade that time
for anything.

59:03.540 --> 59:05.041
But you're forgetting something.

59:05.125 --> 59:06.410
It was just the two of us.

59:06.501 --> 59:07.832
-And now...
-Yeah.

59:08.712 --> 59:11.670
And that's why I thought,
if I destroyed magic in Storybrooke,

59:11.757 --> 59:14.874
then we could all be happy,
like you and I were.

59:14.968 --> 59:17.550
But because of what I did,

59:17.637 --> 59:20.049
we'll never even see
half of our family again.

59:20.140 --> 59:22.301
That may not be true.

59:22.392 --> 59:25.008
Your mom is with Gold
to try to find a way.

59:26.521 --> 59:28.261
Should we see if they had any luck?

59:33.820 --> 59:36.232
Why didn't you believe me

59:36.323 --> 59:38.359
when I told you I wanted to help you?

59:38.450 --> 59:40.566
(CHUCKLES)
Wondering if you've lost your edge?

59:40.660 --> 59:43.276
Or hoping you finally managed
to bury the Evil Queen

59:43.371 --> 59:45.453
deep enough inside
that I wouldn't buy it?

59:45.540 --> 59:47.041
Don't try to psychoanalyze me.

59:47.125 --> 59:50.367
Look, let me give you
a friendly piece of advice.

59:50.462 --> 59:52.578
Partitioning the darkness inside

59:52.672 --> 59:56.415
will not help you become
the woman you want to be.

59:56.510 --> 59:57.716
Worked so far.

59:57.803 --> 59:58.792
Has it?

59:59.930 --> 1:00:01.010
You know, I once thought

1:00:01.098 --> 1:00:04.590
I could contain the darkness
to one tiny corner of my soul.

1:00:04.684 --> 1:00:07.346
First for Baelfire, then for Belle.

1:00:07.437 --> 1:00:10.019
And I always failed.
Do you wanna know why?

1:00:10.065 --> 1:00:12.477
Because I like the darkness.

1:00:13.318 --> 1:00:15.684
It's as much who I am as the light.

1:00:15.779 --> 1:00:18.486
Why can't you seem to grasp
it's not either-or?

1:00:18.573 --> 1:00:20.279
Because I'm not like you.

1:00:21.159 --> 1:00:23.901
I don't like the darkness.

1:00:24.663 --> 1:00:26.574
You can tell yourself what you like,

1:00:26.665 --> 1:00:30.658
but deep down,
the Evil Queen is who you are.

1:00:31.336 --> 1:00:33.998
And the more
you keep her locked inside,

1:00:34.047 --> 1:00:36.163
the more you're going to suffer.

1:00:42.514 --> 1:00:44.971
What the hell is this place?

1:00:48.019 --> 1:00:49.725
Greetings.

1:00:49.813 --> 1:00:52.054
What brings you to my humble shop?

1:00:52.149 --> 1:00:54.606
Well, we are in the market
for something a little more powerful

1:00:54.693 --> 1:00:56.149
than what you have on display.

1:00:56.236 --> 1:00:59.228
If you mean narcotics,
I'm just a simple herbalist.

1:00:59.322 --> 1:01:00.482
I don't think so.

1:01:01.158 --> 1:01:04.321
Regina, meet the Dragon.

1:01:06.454 --> 1:01:08.035
Good to see you're breathing again.

1:01:08.123 --> 1:01:10.330
I hear one of my father's minions
paid you a visit.

1:01:10.417 --> 1:01:14.251
Peter Pan was powerful.
But I'm resilient.

1:01:14.337 --> 1:01:18.956
I assume you're here because
you want something, Rumplestiltskin.

1:01:20.635 --> 1:01:22.796
But I'm afraid I'm not in the business

1:01:22.888 --> 1:01:25.800
of helping hearts
filled with such darkness.

1:01:25.891 --> 1:01:27.756
-Gold, this is a waste of time.
-But you...

1:01:29.352 --> 1:01:30.637
You, lwill help.

1:01:31.813 --> 1:01:36.682
I see a noble battle
deep inside your soul, Regina.

1:01:37.527 --> 1:01:39.108
Between light and dark.

1:01:40.197 --> 1:01:44.907
And for that,
I will do my best to aid you.

1:01:46.578 --> 1:01:50.617
It is imperative you win, for all of us.

1:02:28.828 --> 1:02:30.284
There, look.

1:02:32.707 --> 1:02:33.867
Where the hell is that?

1:02:33.959 --> 1:02:35.415
Wherever it is, they're in trouble.

1:02:36.670 --> 1:02:38.877
We need to get through
so we can help them.

1:03:02.445 --> 1:03:03.480
I've done all I can.

1:03:05.949 --> 1:03:06.938
But you,

1:03:08.535 --> 1:03:10.196
you haven't.

1:03:11.162 --> 1:03:12.151
Me?

1:03:12.789 --> 1:03:14.575
All of you.

1:03:14.666 --> 1:03:16.577
Just because the boy
destroyed Storybrooke's magic

1:03:16.668 --> 1:03:18.704
doesn't mean
there isn't any in this world.

1:03:18.795 --> 1:03:20.296
Really? Because I think
there's a reason

1:03:20.380 --> 1:03:23.338
they call this place
the Land Without Magic.

1:03:23.425 --> 1:03:26.087
Yes, because that's how it appears.

1:03:27.137 --> 1:03:28.547
There's magic everywhere,

1:03:28.722 --> 1:03:30.258
if you're willing to see it.

1:03:31.808 --> 1:03:35.141

a friend told me a long time ago.

1:03:50.368 --> 1:03:51.574
what he taught you.

1:03:54.122 --> 1:03:55.908
You have to believe.

1:03:58.376 --> 1:04:00.287
So, how do you suggest we do that?

1:04:01.212 --> 1:04:04.704
After all, saying you believe
doesn't make it so.

1:04:06.885 --> 1:04:08.250
I know how.

1:04:10.513 --> 1:04:12.720

1:04:12.807 --> 1:04:14.672

Every time someone makes a wish.

1:04:16.936 --> 1:04:18.847
I don't think
throwing a coin in a fountain

1:04:18.938 --> 1:04:20.724
is what the Dragon was talking about.

1:04:21.483 --> 1:04:23.269
All due respect, Grandpa,

1:04:23.360 --> 1:04:25.601
but I think that was exactly
what he was talking about.

1:04:28.573 --> 1:04:30.484
Mom, when we were living in New York,

1:04:30.575 --> 1:04:32.691
do you remember the last time
you took me here?

1:04:32.786 --> 1:04:35.402
Yeah. I don't know.
You were upset about something.

1:04:35.497 --> 1:04:36.532
Maybe something at school.

1:04:36.623 --> 1:04:37.908
It was because of you.

1:04:38.375 --> 1:04:39.956
I could tell you were lonely.

1:04:40.043 --> 1:04:41.533
So I wished our family
would be complete.

1:04:41.628 --> 1:04:43.414
And do you know what happened
a few days later?

1:04:44.130 --> 1:04:45.461
Hook came to New York.

1:04:46.257 --> 1:04:49.294
And he brought us back to Storybrooke
and we were reunited with our family.

1:04:49.386 --> 1:04:50.751
There was magic.

1:04:50.845 --> 1:04:52.506
It was right here.

1:04:52.597 --> 1:04:53.803
We just didn't know it.

1:04:53.890 --> 1:04:57.474
Don't you see?
We just need to wish they were back.

1:05:01.564 --> 1:05:03.896

1:11:08.264 --> 1:11:10.380
you'll do as I ask.

1:11:11.100 --> 1:11:12.135
(CHOKES)

1:11:12.185 --> 1:11:14.722
The only deal
I'm going to make with you

1:11:14.812 --> 1:11:16.723
is the one
where you return that box to me

1:11:16.856 --> 1:11:18.266
and then, I suppose,

1:11:19.025 --> 1:11:20.686
you get to live.

1:11:21.903 --> 1:11:23.109
(STRAINING) I can help you

1:11:24.363 --> 1:11:26.445
wake Belle.

1:11:30.536 --> 1:11:31.742
(GASPS AND COUGHS)

1:11:32.413 --> 1:11:33.493
What did you just say?

1:11:34.081 --> 1:11:36.037
I know that
she's under a sleeping curse.

1:11:36.125 --> 1:11:40.334
I can provide you with
the information to wake her.

1:11:40.421 --> 1:11:41.706
You're lying.

1:11:41.798 --> 1:11:43.334
Thinking it will save your skin.

1:11:44.175 --> 1:11:45.631
Am I now?

1:11:48.554 --> 1:11:49.589
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

1:11:49.680 --> 1:11:54.845
I've been the Warden here
to many, from all distant lands.

1:11:55.269 --> 1:11:56.805
I've learned much.

1:11:56.896 --> 1:11:59.308
There is one place

1:12:00.775 --> 1:12:02.561
that holds the answer you seek.

1:12:07.532 --> 1:12:08.863
Where?

1:12:11.911 --> 1:12:16.905
I think it's time
that we talk about a deal.

1:12:20.503 --> 1:12:23.995
I'll never be able to thank you enough
for coming back to save me.

1:12:24.715 --> 1:12:26.330
Now that I am separated
from that monster,

1:12:26.425 --> 1:12:29.167
I can make a fresh start of my life
in your Storybrooke.

1:12:30.763 --> 1:12:32.754
HOOK: Still missing a crocodile.

1:12:32.849 --> 1:12:34.180
Gold wasn't in the park?

1:12:34.267 --> 1:12:37.179
In all the commotion, he must have
slipped through the portal to find Belle.

1:12:37.270 --> 1:12:38.931
Where's Regina?
Wasn't she out there looking with you?

1:12:39.021 --> 1:12:42.639
No, she said she wanted to be alone
but she wouldn't say why.

1:12:42.733 --> 1:12:44.564
Emma, this couldn't still be
about the squabble you two had

1:12:44.652 --> 1:12:45.641
in Storybrooke, could it?

1:12:45.736 --> 1:12:47.601
No, we solved that.

1:12:47.697 --> 1:12:50.313
I know what this is.
It's something bigger.

1:12:59.458 --> 1:13:00.447
(DOOR OPENS)

1:13:05.548 --> 1:13:06.537
Hey.

1:13:08.259 --> 1:13:10.466
I thought you may like something
to keep you warm.

1:13:11.387 --> 1:13:13.548
You know I don't do
hot cocoa with cinnamon.

1:13:14.432 --> 1:13:15.592
I know.

1:13:18.019 --> 1:13:20.226
MARY: Emma told me
what's going on with you.

1:13:23.149 --> 1:13:24.309
You don't have to go through this alone.

1:13:27.153 --> 1:13:28.893
Well, I'm afraid that I do.

1:13:29.947 --> 1:13:33.110
If I want to keep the Evil Queen at bay,

1:13:33.200 --> 1:13:36.818
I have to open myself up
to a life of pain and suffering.

1:13:39.582 --> 1:13:41.447
And if I don't keep her at bay...

1:13:45.254 --> 1:13:46.960
Well, that's just not an option.

1:13:47.048 --> 1:13:49.130
-There has to be something we can do.
-There isn't.

1:13:49.383 --> 1:13:50.634
Trust me.

1:13:53.054 --> 1:13:55.966
I even made a second wish
at the fountain.

1:13:56.766 --> 1:14:00.133
I wished the Evil Queen away
so I can be free of everything she did.

1:14:02.563 --> 1:14:03.678
Idid.

1:14:06.734 --> 1:14:08.315
We forgive you, you know.

1:14:11.364 --> 1:14:13.821
The problem is,
as long as she's inside me,

1:14:15.117 --> 1:14:16.368
it doesn't matter,

1:14:17.370 --> 1:14:21.579
her baggage, her karma,
call it what you want,

1:14:23.417 --> 1:14:24.998
will always be there.

1:14:27.380 --> 1:14:29.666
Just another useless wish.

1:14:31.342 --> 1:14:32.707
You want a fresh start.

1:14:35.054 --> 1:14:36.794
I don't know for sure, Regina,

1:14:38.432 --> 1:14:40.923
but maybe that wish
can come true after all.

1:14:42.186 --> 1:14:43.266
How?

1:14:45.356 --> 1:14:46.971
MARY: Jekyll said
he didn't know how to thank us,

1:14:47.066 --> 1:14:48.272
but he found a way.

1:14:48.401 --> 1:14:50.733
He grabbed this before we fled the lab.

1:14:50.820 --> 1:14:53.562
It's the serum that split him
from Mr. Hyde.

1:14:53.656 --> 1:14:56.238
He said there's enough left
for another dose.

1:14:56.325 --> 1:14:58.657
You think this will work on me?

1:14:58.744 --> 1:15:02.407
I believe that this could be
the end of the Evil Queen,

1:15:02.498 --> 1:15:05.080
as long as you're sure
that's what you want.

1:15:06.711 --> 1:15:08.292
I want her gone.

1:15:08.379 --> 1:15:09.789
MARY: Then let's get rid of her.

1:15:09.922 --> 1:15:12.755
Let's be the family
we were always meant to be. All of us.

1:15:15.302 --> 1:15:16.428
Go downstairs.

1:15:16.887 --> 1:15:18.843
Jekyll said there will be
a moment of disorientation

1:15:18.973 --> 1:15:20.554
when the Evil Queen
won't have her magic.

1:15:20.641 --> 1:15:22.381
That's your chance.
You cannot hesitate.

1:15:22.476 --> 1:15:23.636
Understood.

1:15:23.728 --> 1:15:26.686
Now, please. Leave me.

1:15:26.772 --> 1:15:29.184
-EMMA: I'm staying.
-I'm staying, too.

1:15:29.859 --> 1:15:31.599
I was there
when the Evil Queen was born.

1:15:31.694 --> 1:15:34.276
I kind of helped bring her into the world.

1:15:35.656 --> 1:15:37.396
I want to see you end her.

1:15:41.662 --> 1:15:43.698
Get ready to stand back because

1:15:44.749 --> 1:15:47.491
I have a feeling we're about to meet
a very angry queen.

1:15:48.085 --> 1:15:49.586
And she didn't like you on a good day.

1:15:50.838 --> 1:15:52.544
-Emma?
-l'm ready.

1:17:14.547 --> 1:17:16.754
You don't have what it takes.

1:17:19.760 --> 1:17:20.875
Regina.

1:17:22.638 --> 1:17:24.378
You're weak.

1:17:34.108 --> 1:17:38.602
No matter what you do,
you can't destroy our darkness.

1:17:41.157 --> 1:17:44.524
Deep down inside, you know the truth.

1:17:48.205 --> 1:17:49.706
You need me.

1:17:55.129 --> 1:17:56.118
No.

1:17:58.215 --> 1:17:59.500
I don't.

1:18:54.188 --> 1:18:56.053
And in one piece.

1:19:03.030 --> 1:19:04.486
I have to go, Henry.

1:19:04.573 --> 1:19:06.438
My dad, I need to talk to him.

1:19:06.533 --> 1:19:07.522
HENRY: Good luck.

1:19:07.618 --> 1:19:09.529
I'm sorry if I got you in trouble

1:19:09.620 --> 1:19:11.576
for missing everyone's trip
back to Camelot.

1:19:12.039 --> 1:19:13.074
It's okay.

1:19:14.959 --> 1:19:18.622
There's something I haven't told you.

1:19:20.214 --> 1:19:21.875
My father didn't go back

1:19:23.008 --> 1:19:25.215
because he isn't from Camelot.

1:19:25.344 --> 1:19:27.881
It's just a place he wound up in.

1:19:27.972 --> 1:19:30.179
I don't understand.

1:19:30.266 --> 1:19:33.429
He's originally from here. This land.

1:19:33.519 --> 1:19:35.100
From a place called Connecticut.

1:19:36.105 --> 1:19:37.094
What?

1:19:37.189 --> 1:19:38.850
He never felt at home in Camelot.

1:19:38.941 --> 1:19:42.980
You know, he always said he was glad
that I was born there because

1:19:43.070 --> 1:19:45.732
being a Connecticut Yankee
in King Arthur's court

1:19:45.823 --> 1:19:47.939
is no great shakes.

1:19:48.033 --> 1:19:50.490
I don't know what great shakes are,

1:19:50.577 --> 1:19:52.954
but I do know that I like it here.

1:20:15.019 --> 1:20:18.853
So, I'm guessing
Operation Mixtape was a success.

1:20:18.939 --> 1:20:20.600
Mom. Come on.

1:20:20.691 --> 1:20:23.148
We still need to untether
the magic from this thing.

1:20:43.297 --> 1:20:44.958
It's even lovelier than you described.

Well, follow me, we'll show you around.
First stop, Granny's.

What is it, love, you don't still
feel guilty about my return, do you?

1:20:54.516 --> 1:20:57.679
No, it'sjust after
everything we've been through,

1:20:57.770 --> 1:21:01.058
darkness, Hades,
being separated by realms...

1:21:02.274 --> 1:21:04.856
Just wanted to say something.

1:21:04.943 --> 1:21:07.855
You know, when we're not
in the middle of a big battle,

1:21:07.946 --> 1:21:11.313
or one of us is facing death.

1:21:11.408 --> 1:21:14.115

I love you.

1:21:36.225 --> 1:21:39.342

You destroyed the Evil Queen.

1:21:39.436 --> 1:21:41.176
How do you feel?

1:21:43.899 --> 1:21:44.888
Free.

1:21:48.612 --> 1:21:52.605
Now let's make sure
no one can ever steal this again.

1:21:56.453 --> 1:21:58.114

1:22:22.896 --> 1:22:24.887
Thank you for that.

1:22:25.816 --> 1:22:28.649
I'd hate to be trapped in this town
without magic.

1:22:28.735 --> 1:22:32.102
That would be truly barbaric.

1:22:32.197 --> 1:22:33.232
Mr. Hyde.

1:22:33.323 --> 1:22:35.154
How did you get here?

1:22:35.242 --> 1:22:36.277
Gold.

1:22:38.203 --> 1:22:39.909
He made a deal with you, didn't he?

1:22:40.414 --> 1:22:41.620
Yes, that he did.

1:22:42.291 --> 1:22:45.158
I provided him with some information

1:22:45.252 --> 1:22:48.836
in exchange for Storybrooke.

1:22:49.381 --> 1:22:50.746
Excuse me?

1:22:50.841 --> 1:22:52.832
Storybrooke is mine now.

1:22:52.926 --> 1:22:55.087
And I brought some friends.

1:23:04.062 --> 1:23:09.022
You know, I've been looking for a place
like this for quite some time.

1:23:09.109 --> 1:23:12.897
A land where all the world's
lost and forgotten stories

1:23:12.988 --> 1:23:14.603
could play themselves out.

1:23:14.698 --> 1:23:17.064
And now that I have brought them here,

1:23:18.035 --> 1:23:20.993
that is exactly what they're going to do.

1:23:21.079 --> 1:23:24.492
Let me tell you something, Mr. Hyde.

1:23:25.626 --> 1:23:27.958
I know how your story ends.

1:23:28.504 --> 1:23:29.584
You lose.

1:23:29.713 --> 1:23:32.876
I wouldn't bet on it, Regina.

1:23:32.966 --> 1:23:35.252
Despite what you may think,

1:23:35.344 --> 1:23:39.053
darkness is not as easy to snuff out

1:23:40.724 --> 1:23:42.464

1:24:36.071 --> 1:24:39.939
Regina never should have
let me out to play.

1:24:40.576 --> 1:24:42.157
What are you doing here?

1:24:42.286 --> 1:24:45.574
I came to set the record straight.

1:24:46.206 --> 1:24:48.788
You were right about one thing, Dragon.

1:24:48.875 --> 1:24:53.744
There was a battle
raging inside Regina.

1:24:53.839 --> 1:24:55.545
And she may have won the fight.

1:24:57.175 --> 1:24:58.676
But this

1:25:00.095 --> 1:25:01.676
is a war.

1:25:04.057 --> 1:25:05.558
And it'sjust begun.
