WEBVTT

00:13.600 --> 00:15.100
We're supposed to be Zumba-ing,
you zombie.

00:15.200 --> 00:17.000
Have the whole house
to ourselves this weekend.

00:17.100 --> 00:19.133
- Oh, yeah. I forgot.

00:19.233 --> 00:22.233
- You want to come now or keep
playing stare at phone game?

00:22.333 --> 00:23.833
- My ex-boyfriend
just invited me to dinner

00:23.933 --> 00:25.100
and I said yes.

00:25.200 --> 00:26.667
- Oh, nice.

00:26.767 --> 00:28.133
A little sex with the ex.
Make it more complex.

00:28.233 --> 00:29.767
I like that.
- No.

00:29.867 --> 00:32.000
Look like a tiny T

00:32.100 --> 00:34.733
- No. No.
I don't want to go. I panicked.

00:34.833 --> 00:37.933
Like saying no would show
weakness or something.

00:38.033 --> 00:40.100
Now he's gonna pick me up

00:40.200 --> 00:41.667
and see how I'm living,
that I'm poor.

00:41.767 --> 00:43.067
I wasted my education.

00:43.167 --> 00:44.767
- And you live in a mansion.

00:44.867 --> 00:49.633
- I work in a mansion
as a nanny to an adult.

00:49.733 --> 00:53.067
- Okay.
- With no mental disabilities.

00:53.167 --> 00:54.467
- Okay, you don't need to

00:54.567 --> 00:57.100
make us both
feel like crap, Billie.

00:57.200 --> 01:00.400
- Meanwhile, he's on the back
of his own book jackets.

01:00.500 --> 01:02.867
- Whoa.
You dated Juliette Lewis?

01:02.967 --> 01:05.067
Oh, my gosh, what is she like?
- No, that's him.

01:05.167 --> 01:06.367
- She's, like,
my favorite singer.

01:06.467 --> 01:08.333
- He's in town on a book tour.

01:08.433 --> 01:09.767
Thought he'd
take the opportunity

01:09.867 --> 01:11.600
to come by and remind me

01:11.700 --> 01:13.467
how not sad he is
that he dumped me

01:13.567 --> 01:14.933
and what a failure I am,

01:15.067 --> 01:17.867
and stop reading
and enjoying the book, Gene.

01:17.967 --> 01:19.633
I can see you out
of the corner of my eye.

01:19.733 --> 01:21.900
- I just want to see
if Sancho takes the bait.

01:22.067 --> 01:23.467
Just let me see!

01:23.567 --> 01:25.533
- How could you be so advanced
in this plotline!

01:25.633 --> 01:27.200
- It's engaging!
I can't help it!

01:27.300 --> 01:29.233
- Okay!
You can barely read.

01:29.333 --> 01:31.433
How do you know so much
about what's going on?

01:31.533 --> 01:33.267
- That's not true.
I can read just fine.

01:33.367 --> 01:34.567
- Say that word.

01:34.667 --> 01:35.867
- "Tuh-rhee."

01:35.967 --> 01:38.700
- Three.
- Okay.

01:40.800 --> 01:42.700
- A "W."

01:42.800 --> 01:44.567
- It's--
that's correct as well.

01:44.667 --> 01:46.567
- * We're too gangsta for TV

01:46.667 --> 01:48.233
* That's why
you don't see us *

01:48.333 --> 01:49.800
* But they still
wanna be us *

01:49.900 --> 01:52.933
Ha ha!

01:53.067 --> 01:57.100
- Wow, time
really did kill them all.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.467
Yeah, he sucks.

01:59.567 --> 02:02.100
You've been
reading for four hours.

02:02.200 --> 02:03.867
- I know, and I hate to read.

02:03.967 --> 02:06.200
- Don't you think it's weird
that he just wants to

02:06.300 --> 02:07.833
have dinner all of a sudden?

02:07.933 --> 02:10.533
- Maybe, like,
you were his best sex

02:10.633 --> 02:12.333
and he misses your body.

02:12.433 --> 02:13.567
- Doubtful.
- Yeah.

02:13.667 --> 02:16.433
- Maybe he's dying.

02:16.533 --> 02:18.367
- Oh, God. I would love that.

02:18.467 --> 02:19.767
- Oh, my God.

02:19.867 --> 02:21.400
Where's my phone?
I want to cancel.

02:21.500 --> 02:23.367
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
- I want to cancel.

02:23.467 --> 02:25.433
- Let's be proactive,
like Adam Levine's face wash.

02:25.533 --> 02:27.533
- Okay.

02:27.633 --> 02:29.933
Okay, so, this guy dumped you,
right?

02:30.067 --> 02:31.333
'Cause he thought
he could do better.

02:31.433 --> 02:32.767
- Right.

02:32.867 --> 02:36.233
- And then he turned out
to actually do better,

02:36.333 --> 02:38.067
and you sort of didn't.

02:38.167 --> 02:39.767
- I know that.

02:39.867 --> 02:42.067
- But we're not gonna give him
the satisfaction, are we?

02:42.100 --> 02:43.933
No.
You know what we're gonna do?

02:45.600 --> 02:47.600
Think of a plan!
- No, no. No plans.

02:47.700 --> 02:49.433
- I'm so good at them.
- You're not.

02:49.533 --> 02:52.167
I don't want to do any more
of your weird, dumb schemes.

02:52.267 --> 02:54.067
- Okay, I got it.

02:54.100 --> 02:56.067
When he shows up, you hide
and I'll be all,

02:56.100 --> 03:00.100
"Oh, Billie?
She died 100 years ago."

03:00.200 --> 03:01.600
- Did you hear what
I just said?

03:01.700 --> 03:03.467
- Wait for the scary
punch line.

03:03.567 --> 03:06.900
"100 years ago
on this very day."

03:07.067 --> 03:08.967
- I'm glad I waited for that.
No.

03:09.067 --> 03:12.533
- Ooh, or we could order you
a hot, beefy male prostitute

03:12.633 --> 03:13.867
and you'll be like,
"Oh, this guy?

03:13.967 --> 03:15.333
He's my hot,
beefy male husband."

03:15.433 --> 03:16.700
- Stop brainstorming.

03:16.800 --> 03:18.533
"Billie's my wife."

03:18.633 --> 03:21.200
This is so dumb.

03:21.300 --> 03:23.333
I'm such an idiot.

03:23.433 --> 03:24.833
- You're not.
You're not dumb.

03:24.933 --> 03:26.833
Listen to me.
You're the smartest person

03:26.933 --> 03:28.467
I've ever met, Billie.

03:28.567 --> 03:30.200
Okay? You're the full package.

03:30.300 --> 03:33.067
You're brains and a bod, okay?
- Thank you.

03:33.100 --> 03:34.533
- I bet when guys
are  you,

03:34.633 --> 03:36.567
they're just like, "Shut up."

03:37.933 --> 03:39.400
- You know
what I'm not gonna do?

03:39.500 --> 03:42.300
I'm not gonna let
this stupid talented writer

03:42.400 --> 03:44.067
with an exceptional ability

03:44.100 --> 03:48.167
to build suspense
come in and make you feel small.

03:48.267 --> 03:49.400
both: No.

03:49.500 --> 03:51.067
- I got the plan.

03:51.133 --> 03:53.233
You're gonna invite him
over for dinner

03:53.333 --> 03:55.633
and you're gonna pretend
that house is yours

03:55.733 --> 03:57.500
and that I work for you!

03:58.933 --> 04:00.367
- No.
- Yes!

04:00.467 --> 04:02.800
Oh, my God.
It's so good.

04:02.900 --> 04:04.533
- Maybe we could do it
as a hypothetical.

04:06.400 --> 04:12.200
- No, I mean, this isn't
an experiment we could just--

04:12.300 --> 04:15.133
yeah, let's do it.

04:15.233 --> 04:17.600
- Okay.

04:17.700 --> 04:18.833
What?
- Plan.

04:18.933 --> 04:20.700
- Oh.
You got to be more clear.

04:23.400 --> 04:24.933
Okay.
I got you.

04:25.067 --> 04:27.967
You got to trust me, though.
It's not my first rodeo.

04:28.067 --> 04:30.167
It is my first time
doing makeup on someone, though.

04:30.267 --> 04:32.267
* Laa

04:32.367 --> 04:34.633
- I do have nice cheekbones.
I'd love to pop those out.

04:34.733 --> 04:35.933
- Oh, they're popping.

04:36.067 --> 04:37.500
Okay, this without a bra,
though.

04:37.600 --> 04:39.167
- No, no, no, no.
- Don't wear a bra.

04:39.267 --> 04:40.500
It's like you need no makeup.

04:43.800 --> 04:46.200
- I normally don't do
a lot of makeup.

04:46.300 --> 04:47.867
- Oops. I just--
you know what?

04:47.967 --> 04:49.133
It actually
doesn't look that bad.

04:49.233 --> 04:50.667
This one's nude.

04:50.767 --> 04:52.700
It'll remind him
what you'll look like nude.

04:54.133 --> 04:56.800
- I feel pretty.

04:56.900 --> 04:58.867
- I'm just gonna add
a little bit of foundation.

04:58.967 --> 05:00.500
- Okay.
- That's what I do last.

05:00.600 --> 05:02.567
- Are you sure foundation
goes last?

05:05.133 --> 05:06.400
And it comes with pants.

05:08.167 --> 05:10.967
- Oh, God.

05:13.167 --> 05:14.600
- No.

05:14.700 --> 05:16.467
Don't laugh.
- Okay.

05:16.567 --> 05:19.067
Your brows are like the arrows
to your eyes.

05:19.100 --> 05:21.467
- No. No eyebrows.

05:23.333 --> 05:26.133
Now that I'm looking at it,
a different eye shadow.

05:27.933 --> 05:29.600
Good evening.
- Evening.

05:29.700 --> 05:31.800
- You must be Mr. Dobbs.
- Indeed.

05:31.900 --> 05:34.300
- I'm Miss Brown's maid
and personal assistant.

05:34.400 --> 05:37.233
My name is Gene Raj.

05:37.333 --> 05:39.300
My name is totally Raj.
That's my name.

05:39.400 --> 05:41.800
- All right.
Well, it's a pleasure.

05:41.900 --> 05:44.067
- No.
But it is a pleasure.

05:44.167 --> 05:46.067
- That's what I said.

05:46.100 --> 05:48.400
What's this?

05:48.500 --> 05:50.733
There it is.
Thank you.

05:50.833 --> 05:53.433
- How very Spanish of us.
Please do walk in.

05:53.533 --> 05:55.833
- Yeah.
That's not Spanish.

05:57.767 --> 05:59.667
This is a beautiful house.

05:59.767 --> 06:01.367
- Thank you.

06:01.467 --> 06:03.667
For Miss Brown.
I'll tell her you said so.

06:03.767 --> 06:05.067
- All right.

06:05.100 --> 06:07.667
Wow.
That is an amazing piece.

06:07.767 --> 06:10.367
- Yeah, I like to think of it
as, like, a bunch of fish

06:10.467 --> 06:12.067
who just got an X-ray,
and, like,

06:12.133 --> 06:13.733
they're praying
for positive results

06:13.833 --> 06:15.367
from their fish doctor.

06:15.467 --> 06:16.600
It's like,
"What's gonna happen?"

06:16.700 --> 06:18.133
- Yeah, of course.

06:18.233 --> 06:19.967
And I will get her.
He's here!

06:23.067 --> 06:25.233
*

06:25.333 --> 06:27.200
- Wilhemina Brown.

06:27.300 --> 06:28.633
- McCallister Doobs.

06:28.733 --> 06:30.700
- Dobbs.
- Oh, right.

06:30.800 --> 06:32.633
Pardon me.

06:32.733 --> 06:36.867
It's been so long, and I've
forgotten so much about you.

06:36.967 --> 06:40.900
- Mm.
- Sorry about the echo in here.

06:41.067 --> 06:42.733
It's 'cause my house is so big.

06:42.833 --> 06:45.067
- You know what they say
about people with big houses.

06:45.133 --> 06:46.933
- Mm-mm.
- Big clit.

06:48.467 --> 06:50.500
- Can I ask how you came
into all this wealth?

06:52.233 --> 06:54.400
- You can.

06:54.500 --> 06:57.867
Long answer is--
how much time do you have?

07:00.967 --> 07:05.133
The...short answer is

07:05.233 --> 07:07.167
I own a boat company

07:07.267 --> 07:08.867
that I have.
- Mm-hmm.

07:08.967 --> 07:13.500
- But why talk about business
when you can embrace?

07:13.600 --> 07:15.100
- Okay.
You all right?

07:15.200 --> 07:16.600
- You smell wonderful.

07:16.700 --> 07:18.067
Thank you, Gene.

07:18.133 --> 07:20.433
- It's Raj. My name.
- Raj, of course.

07:20.533 --> 07:22.167
Shall we...
- Jesus.

07:22.267 --> 07:23.567
- Oh, no,

07:23.667 --> 07:25.100
'cause dinner's
not ready yet.

07:25.200 --> 07:26.767
I mean, I know.

07:26.867 --> 07:29.867
- You know what,
how about a little tour?

07:29.967 --> 07:32.933
- That's what I was going
to say if you'd let me finish.

07:33.067 --> 07:34.267
- Oh, I'm sorry.

07:34.367 --> 07:35.667
- I was also gonna
suggest just that.

07:35.767 --> 07:37.067
- Good idea.

07:37.167 --> 07:40.333
This is my own cinema paradiso.
- Mm-hmm.

07:40.433 --> 07:43.233
- It spoiled me
for the theaters, but--

07:43.333 --> 07:44.767
- Let's see
what's on the reels here.

07:46.333 --> 07:48.833
- Oh, nope. Nope.
Sorry about that.

07:48.933 --> 07:51.867
That is my porn.
It's totally Raj's porn.

07:51.967 --> 07:54.600
Nothing gets me more horned up
than drawn-on dinks.

07:54.700 --> 07:58.600
My staff is very, uh, "allowed."

07:58.700 --> 08:00.067
- Soup's on!

08:00.100 --> 08:02.300
Hi.

08:02.400 --> 08:03.833
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:07.067 --> 08:08.433
- Yes, just seat yourself,
McCallister.

08:08.533 --> 08:09.967
I'll be back momentarily.
Gene!

08:10.067 --> 08:12.067
done.
- Gene!

08:12.133 --> 08:13.900
What?

08:14.067 --> 08:16.300
This isn't part of the plan.
- This is New Chet.

08:16.400 --> 08:18.133
- Hi.
I'm Darryl.

08:18.233 --> 08:20.733
- I was inspired by your whole
blast from the past situation.

08:20.833 --> 08:22.733
Darryl and I used
to ass-mule liquid cocaine

08:22.833 --> 08:24.067
out of the Bahamas together.

08:24.167 --> 08:25.967
- And we were married.

08:26.067 --> 08:27.300
- Oh, that's right!
We were.

08:27.400 --> 08:30.133
Yes.
- Oh, for two days.

08:30.233 --> 08:31.467
- Oh, my gosh.

08:31.567 --> 08:32.733
Wednesday and--

08:32.833 --> 08:34.933
both: Thursday.
- Excuse me!

08:35.067 --> 08:36.633
- The burner isn't even on.

08:36.733 --> 08:38.933
his burner's not--
you're cooking over nothing.

08:39.067 --> 08:40.700
- Okay.
- Oh, God.

08:40.800 --> 08:42.167
This isn't going well.

08:42.267 --> 08:43.833
No, no, no, no.
I'm gonna tell him.

08:43.933 --> 08:45.433
- No, no, no, no.
You can't tell him.

08:45.533 --> 08:46.700
You can't tell him.
It's gonna be fine.

08:46.800 --> 08:49.067
- Get your hair-finger
out of the soup!

08:49.100 --> 08:50.267
- Look, solved.

08:50.367 --> 08:51.667
- He just sucked--

08:51.767 --> 08:54.200
- Darryl is here for a reason,
okay, mon?

08:54.300 --> 08:56.700
- Why are you talking
like a Rastafarian?

09:00.700 --> 09:02.067
- Okay.

09:02.133 --> 09:05.600
Got it? Okay.

09:05.700 --> 09:07.667
- Thank you.

09:07.767 --> 09:12.533
- Dinner will be here soon,
because I-I'ma get it.

09:12.633 --> 09:14.533
- Thank you.

09:14.633 --> 09:17.500
So nice of you to come tonight.

09:17.600 --> 09:20.233
And I've changed so much
since our..."skyool" days.

09:22.100 --> 09:24.167
- Sort of a global accent.

09:24.267 --> 09:26.533
I'm very world-traveled,
like Madonna Ciccone,

09:26.633 --> 09:30.200
who I've met
at several giant balls.

09:30.300 --> 09:32.067
- Where did you,
uh, travel last?

09:32.167 --> 09:34.067
I love to travel.

09:34.167 --> 09:38.100
- Oh, it's...
all a blur.

09:38.200 --> 09:40.667
Peni--Pen Island.

09:40.767 --> 09:42.167
- So glad we could do this.

09:42.267 --> 09:44.067
- You mentioned that,
like, 30 seconds ago.

09:44.167 --> 09:46.067
- Mm.
- It actually worked out well

09:46.133 --> 09:48.400
'cause my book signing, um,
was canceled.

09:48.500 --> 09:50.367
- That must make you
feel like...

09:50.467 --> 09:52.367
no one likes your books.

09:52.467 --> 09:55.067
- No.
No, just too many RSVPs.

09:55.133 --> 09:56.433
Had to move it
to a bigger venue.

09:56.533 --> 09:58.333
I'll be hitting up
the B & Nobles

09:58.433 --> 10:00.900
in Pasadena tomorrow.

10:01.000 --> 10:04.233
- Grea--great.

10:04.333 --> 10:06.067
So glad you could come.

10:06.167 --> 10:07.233
- You said that.

10:07.333 --> 10:08.500
- Boom, boom,
shake the room.

10:08.600 --> 10:10.233
- There we go.

10:10.333 --> 10:12.433
- Nah, you haven't seen me
in a bunch of years though, man.

10:12.533 --> 10:13.900
I am grown.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.433
- Yeah.

10:15.533 --> 10:18.367
I've got a house.
I'm in a bowling league.

10:18.467 --> 10:19.700
- Yeah.

10:19.800 --> 10:22.100
I've got, like, two,
three kids.

10:22.200 --> 10:23.567
- So, you're
not a prostitute anymore?

10:23.667 --> 10:25.333
- No, I'm still a prostitute.
- Oh.

10:25.433 --> 10:28.100
Terribly confining or--

10:28.200 --> 10:30.767
- Ugh.
Alice left me.

10:30.867 --> 10:32.667
We're in the middle
of a divorce right now.

10:32.767 --> 10:34.867
It's ugly.

10:34.967 --> 10:37.600
- I'm so sorry, McCallister.
I didn't--I didn't know.

10:37.700 --> 10:40.067
- Don't be. Actually,
it turned out quite well.

10:40.167 --> 10:42.933
I'm now dating successful
screenwriter Diablo Cody.

10:43.033 --> 10:44.300
She won the Oscar for
"Juno."

10:46.167 --> 10:47.733
- Never heard of it.
- Yes, you have.

10:47.833 --> 10:49.800
- I don't know.
J'you know?

10:49.900 --> 10:50.800
- It's "Juno."
The movie.

10:52.500 --> 10:53.667
- J'you know that I'm dating

10:53.767 --> 10:55.167
successful screenwriter
Diablo Cody?

10:57.100 --> 10:58.767
- I don't know, like,
what's making me think of this

10:58.867 --> 11:03.367
right now, but I've, like,
always wanted to be a witch,

11:03.467 --> 11:06.400
with, like,
a bubbling cauldron.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.700
- That's super dope, man.
Go for it.

11:08.800 --> 11:10.233
- Thanks. I will.

11:10.333 --> 11:13.200
- Hey, remember that Christmas

11:13.300 --> 11:15.233
when we broke
into that kid's house

11:15.333 --> 11:18.633
but we couldn't steal anything
'cause he was so wily?

11:18.733 --> 11:20.633
- No.

11:20.733 --> 11:25.167
- Yeah, we were casing the place
for weeks posing as plumbers.

11:25.267 --> 11:27.067
I think we even had a name.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.067
- Yes!

11:30.100 --> 11:32.233
- Yeah, that's the plot
to "Home Alone."

11:32.333 --> 11:34.400
- Oh, so it didn't happen again
in New York?

11:34.500 --> 11:36.067
- No.
That's "Home Alone 2."

11:36.133 --> 11:39.367
- The other day, we were
laughing our tails off in bed.

11:39.467 --> 11:40.867
I mean, this is, like,

11:40.967 --> 11:44.533
the healthiest relationship
I have ever been in.

11:44.633 --> 11:48.967
Mutual respect has been
a, uh...revelation.

11:49.067 --> 11:50.533
Is it hot in here?

11:52.067 --> 11:54.233
- I'm seeing...everyone.

11:55.400 --> 11:58.467
- Sorry.
Sorry for the delay.

11:58.567 --> 12:01.067
Tuna tartare?

12:01.133 --> 12:03.067
What is this?
- It's tuna tartare.

12:03.133 --> 12:04.700
From the sea.

12:06.100 --> 12:08.433
- I think I'll pass.

12:08.533 --> 12:10.100
Oh,
take a bite out of that?

12:10.200 --> 12:12.867
You know, you may want
to hire a new chef.

12:12.967 --> 12:14.767
- Oh, it's pronounced New Chet,
Doobs.

12:14.867 --> 12:15.867
- It's Dobbs.

12:17.967 --> 12:19.500
- I don't want it.

12:21.467 --> 12:23.600
- Um, sure, I'll--

12:23.700 --> 12:24.867
Thank you.

12:24.967 --> 12:26.533
- I don't know.

12:26.633 --> 12:30.067
- Comes with a warm cleave kiss.
- Oh, I don't want--

12:30.133 --> 12:31.867
- Mmm.
- Yes.

12:31.967 --> 12:34.067
- Oof.
Smells like sex-juices.

12:34.133 --> 12:35.667
- No, I think
that's the dinner.

12:35.767 --> 12:37.767
- Thank you.

12:37.867 --> 12:39.633
- Mmm.
Taste is still on my lips.

12:39.733 --> 12:40.933
- Okay.

12:41.067 --> 12:43.700
- Hey.

12:43.800 --> 12:45.667
- I want you in me.

12:45.767 --> 12:47.333
- Okay.

12:47.433 --> 12:50.167
- Everybody's peen
in the room just went "doop"!

12:50.267 --> 12:52.933
- No. Not everyone.

12:53.067 --> 12:55.233
- Thank you.
You may go.

12:55.333 --> 12:57.900
- Hey, Billie.
- It's not going well.

12:58.067 --> 12:59.267
Leave, leave.

13:03.100 --> 13:05.733
- Your staff is, um, eccentric.

13:05.833 --> 13:07.633
- Yes.
- Borderline inappropriate.

13:07.733 --> 13:09.067
- Mm-hmm.
- Horny.

13:09.167 --> 13:11.467
- Sorry about all this.

13:11.567 --> 13:13.500
I'm on a very strict diet.

13:13.600 --> 13:15.133
I can only eat certain foods.

13:15.233 --> 13:19.167
- Just, uh, fish in a can
and generic white bread?

13:19.267 --> 13:22.400
- Boring,
but my body looks great naked.

13:22.500 --> 13:24.067
- Mm-hmm.

13:24.100 --> 13:27.400
- And in very--oops--
plunging necklines, I guess.

13:27.500 --> 13:29.100
- It's too low.

13:29.200 --> 13:33.767
- If anybody finds a little
dolphin belly button ring,

13:33.867 --> 13:35.300
it belongs to someone
in the kitchen.

13:35.400 --> 13:38.400
[classical music plays
in background]

13:38.500 --> 13:39.967
*

13:40.067 --> 13:43.067
- So, tell me
about your little book.

13:43.100 --> 13:44.700
- Well, they're saying
"best-seller."

13:44.800 --> 13:46.300
- "The New York Times."

13:46.400 --> 13:49.067
- Not familiar.
- It's a massive newspaper.

13:49.167 --> 13:50.867
- Online or...

13:50.967 --> 13:53.167
- Yeah, I'm sure they
have a presence online as well.

13:53.267 --> 13:56.067
- I'll take your word for it.
- You can look it up.

13:56.167 --> 13:57.700
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
I believe you.

13:57.800 --> 13:59.500
- Thank you.

13:59.600 --> 14:02.267
You know, I think you might
actually really like my book.

14:02.367 --> 14:03.900
It's about a scorned lover

14:04.067 --> 14:06.833
who fakes a whole new identify
in order to get revenge.

14:08.200 --> 14:11.067
Ha ha ha ha.

14:11.167 --> 14:13.067
Sounds very different
from my lifestyle.

14:13.133 --> 14:17.067
- Billie, I write crime novels
for a living.

14:17.133 --> 14:19.233
I notice clues.

14:19.333 --> 14:21.600
There are pictures
of your assistant everywhere

14:21.700 --> 14:23.767
and there are none of you.

14:23.867 --> 14:25.400
And I'm pretty sure your chef,

14:25.500 --> 14:28.100
he offered me sex
at a gas station.

14:28.200 --> 14:31.900
And someone who says they own
a boat company, oh, they don't.

14:32.067 --> 14:35.467
And Raj is wearing
an ankle monitor.

14:35.567 --> 14:37.700
As Diablo once wrote,

14:37.800 --> 14:42.433
"This is one doodle
that can't be untied, home fry."

14:42.533 --> 14:44.867
- I don't think that's the line.
Not that I've seen it.

14:44.967 --> 14:47.467
- Hmm.
You know what I think?

14:47.567 --> 14:49.700
I think that you're probably
some employee here,

14:49.800 --> 14:53.067
and this woman-child
hatched this farce

14:53.100 --> 14:55.767
because she pities you,
and rightfully so.

14:55.867 --> 14:58.067
Yeah.
Am I close?

14:58.133 --> 15:00.433
Maybe I am just an employee.

15:00.533 --> 15:02.500
I am.
I'm a nanny, actually.

15:02.600 --> 15:06.267
And I'm not rich and on the back
of my own book jackets.

15:06.367 --> 15:08.400
But you know what I am?

15:08.500 --> 15:10.233
I am a good person,

15:10.333 --> 15:13.600
and that is something
you will never be.

15:13.700 --> 15:17.067
- Mm, how many times
did you rehearse that?

15:17.133 --> 15:18.600
you!

15:18.700 --> 15:20.200
You look like Juliette Lewis.
- No, I don't.

15:20.300 --> 15:21.900
- You were very good
in "Natural Born Killers."

15:22.067 --> 15:23.867
- That wasn't me.

15:23.967 --> 15:25.500
- Did Robert De Niro's fingers
taste like cigars

15:25.600 --> 15:27.500
in "Cape Fear"?

15:27.600 --> 15:30.233
What is eating Gilbert Grape?
- That's it. I'm out of here.

15:30.333 --> 15:31.667
- Whoa!
- Hu--

15:31.767 --> 15:33.367
- Nobody's going anywhere.

15:33.467 --> 15:35.100
- That's a real gun.
He has a real gun!

15:35.200 --> 15:36.700
- Yeah, good, Nancy Drew.

15:36.800 --> 15:37.933
You solved the mystery!

15:38.067 --> 15:40.933
- Gene, Gene.
Raj!

15:42.733 --> 15:43.967
- Hey, boo-boo.

15:45.200 --> 15:46.633
This is not part of the plan.

15:46.733 --> 15:48.267
- I got a new plan,

15:48.367 --> 15:52.967
and that involves me
taking money from you guys.

15:53.067 --> 15:54.333
Hey, you want to do
a double whammy?

15:54.433 --> 15:56.067
- No.

15:56.167 --> 15:58.633
- It's really fun.
We get up super close.

15:58.733 --> 16:01.400
I put the gun in my butt,
pull the trigger...

16:01.500 --> 16:02.900
- No.

16:03.067 --> 16:05.200
- Bullet goes in my butt,
out my wein-hole,

16:05.300 --> 16:07.567
into your butt,
and out your wein-hole,

16:07.667 --> 16:09.700
and together, as buddies,

16:09.800 --> 16:11.867
we ruin our bathroom parts.

16:11.967 --> 16:16.667
- No!

16:16.767 --> 16:18.667
- You don't want that purse.

16:18.767 --> 16:19.933
There's nothing in it.
It's Billie's. She's poor.

16:20.067 --> 16:21.833
- Hey.
- Sorry.

16:21.933 --> 16:23.767
- Hey, baby, you got your
dinner, now I'm getting my tip.

16:23.867 --> 16:25.067
You feel me?

16:25.167 --> 16:26.433
- I don't want to feel
your tip.

16:26.533 --> 16:28.500
- Excuse me, Mr. New Chet.

16:28.600 --> 16:30.067
Hi.
- Hi.

16:30.133 --> 16:32.567
- Um, I really had
nothing to do with any of this,

16:32.667 --> 16:35.067
and, um,
I'm sort of a personality,

16:35.100 --> 16:36.667
so me being around
is just gonna bring--

16:36.767 --> 16:38.833
- Hey, shut up,

16:38.933 --> 16:41.100
or I'm gonna touch
your body.

16:42.600 --> 16:44.167
- Hey, you, "Maid to Order."

16:44.267 --> 16:45.600
Do you know the code
to the safe?

16:45.700 --> 16:47.067
- No, I have no idea.

16:47.133 --> 16:48.900
"No, I have no idea."

16:49.067 --> 16:50.333
- That's a good impression.

16:50.433 --> 16:53.433
- Well, it's all good,
my sexy exy.

16:53.533 --> 16:56.267
- Stop giving me gun kisses.
Stop it.

16:56.367 --> 16:59.167
- My friends Chainsaw
and Dynamite are coming,

16:59.267 --> 17:02.733
and they're bringing a chainsaw
and some dynamite,

17:02.833 --> 17:04.233
so don't worry.

17:04.333 --> 17:07.133
We're gonna crack that bitch.

17:07.233 --> 17:08.433
Dyno, what's up, dog?

17:08.533 --> 17:10.600
Yo, dog.
I already gave you the address.

17:10.700 --> 17:11.967
I don't--hey, Gene!

17:12.067 --> 17:13.367
What's the zip here?

17:13.467 --> 17:15.567
- Oh, 93422.
- Gene, you just--

17:15.667 --> 17:17.367
- And at the front gate,
it's #82.

17:17.467 --> 17:18.633
- Thank you.
93422--

17:18.733 --> 17:20.300
- Damn it! Gene!

17:20.400 --> 17:21.900
- Thanks for the lovely evening,
Billie.

17:22.067 --> 17:23.733
It's been great catching up.

17:23.833 --> 17:26.233
- Look, I'm sorry, okay,
but this is not my fault.

17:26.333 --> 17:28.200
I can't see your faces.

17:28.300 --> 17:29.967
- Are you suggesting
that this is my fault?

17:30.067 --> 17:31.200
- You guys have, like,
the same voice.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.067
The same cadence.

17:33.167 --> 17:34.867
- Mm-hmm. Yeah, yeah,
that's what I'm suggesting,

17:34.967 --> 17:36.367
- Tone-wise, you're the same.
- That it's your fault.

17:36.467 --> 17:38.300
How is this my fault?

17:38.400 --> 17:40.233
- Oh, my God.
I was being sarcastic.

17:40.333 --> 17:42.067
I think it's my fault.

17:42.167 --> 17:45.467
I'm the one who invited
the kidnapper into the house.

17:45.567 --> 17:47.633
- Shut up, Gene!
- Shut up, Raj!

17:47.733 --> 17:49.333
- That's hurtful,
but it is helpful

17:49.433 --> 17:51.167
that we
say each other's names, yes?

17:51.267 --> 17:53.233
- Hey, look.
It's a talking party!

17:53.333 --> 17:57.067
Where's my invitation?

17:57.100 --> 17:59.233
And look what I found
in a drawer, woman.

17:59.333 --> 18:00.900
- Those aren't mine.
That's not even my style!

18:01.067 --> 18:02.467
- Now, give me your wallets.

18:02.567 --> 18:04.733
- You don't want mine.
It's full of Pogs!

18:04.833 --> 18:06.967
You're rich.

18:07.067 --> 18:08.900
Let's see that money clip.

18:09.067 --> 18:11.067
Oh! Quiet.

18:11.133 --> 18:13.067
My parents
are in the next room.

18:13.100 --> 18:15.767
- Let me see that money clip.

18:15.867 --> 18:18.800
What do you got for me,
sir?

18:18.900 --> 18:23.667
Dude, $4
and an expired Discover card?

18:23.767 --> 18:25.067
- Uh-huh.

18:25.100 --> 18:26.267
- You trying to hold out
on me, man?

18:26.367 --> 18:27.533
- No, no.

18:27.633 --> 18:30.433
- Better show me that money,

18:30.533 --> 18:33.133
or I'm gonna search
all over your body.

18:33.233 --> 18:34.700
- I don't have any.

18:34.800 --> 18:36.067
I don't have any money!

18:36.100 --> 18:37.300
I don't have any money!

18:37.400 --> 18:38.867
I am broke, okay?

18:38.967 --> 18:41.333
What about your books?

18:41.433 --> 18:43.967
Nobody buys books anymore.

18:44.067 --> 18:45.333
And besides,
I'm in so much debt

18:45.433 --> 18:46.967
it wouldn't
even make a difference.

18:47.067 --> 18:50.367
I invested a lot of money
in private trains,

18:50.467 --> 18:52.067
and it didn't take.

18:52.100 --> 18:54.467
I am a fraud! Okay?

18:54.567 --> 18:56.533
I am a fraud! I am not rich!

18:56.633 --> 18:58.133
I am not dating Diablo Cody!

18:58.233 --> 19:00.667
"The New York Times"
did not review my book!

19:00.767 --> 19:03.267
The only place
that will sell it is CVS!

19:03.367 --> 19:05.767
And I admit it!
I admit it!

19:05.867 --> 19:08.900
Yeah, I do look a little bit
like Juliette Lewis, okay?

19:09.067 --> 19:10.767
Not a ton. Don't say that.

19:10.867 --> 19:12.100
Not a ton, but a little bit.

19:12.200 --> 19:14.233
The only reason I came here

19:14.333 --> 19:18.067
is because I thought that maybe
looking at you in your situation

19:18.133 --> 19:22.767
would make me feel good
about myself, and God, it did.

19:22.867 --> 19:24.267
You are in a horrible place,

19:24.367 --> 19:26.733
but it makes me feel better,
and I thank you.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.567
- Thank you.
- I'm happier because of that.

19:28.667 --> 19:29.900
I'm glad I came.

19:30.067 --> 19:31.367
- Yeah, thank you.
- Thank you.

19:31.467 --> 19:33.067
And if you guys want a deal
on a private--

19:33.100 --> 19:34.867
- Oh, my God, dude, shut up.

19:34.967 --> 19:36.400
- My God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

19:36.500 --> 19:38.900
- Darryl, don't.
- Wait!

19:39.067 --> 19:40.933
I-I know the code to the safe.

19:41.067 --> 19:43.167
- Yes. Point the gun
at me, White Marley.

19:43.267 --> 19:44.733
- Put the gun on her, please!

19:44.833 --> 19:46.333
- Oh, my God.
You are a dickhead.

19:46.433 --> 19:48.167
- I know.
- Just untie me and I'll get it.

19:48.267 --> 19:50.233
- You are a major one.
- I'll get you the code.

19:50.333 --> 19:53.867
Just got to get something
out of my--saved it on my phone,

19:53.967 --> 19:57.233
which is in my purse,
which is right here!

19:57.333 --> 19:59.233
Ah!

19:59.333 --> 20:02.900
Billie, that was the coolest
thing I've ever seen!

20:03.000 --> 20:05.433
- Oh, my God. McCallister,
did you pee your pants?

20:11.267 --> 20:13.333
pants, man.

20:13.433 --> 20:18.133
- Oh, yeah, that was me.
That's piss.

20:18.233 --> 20:19.633
- I love that you still
have the wig on.

20:19.733 --> 20:21.300
So meta! Like,
you should do this "profesh."

20:21.400 --> 20:23.233
- I want to.
I'm getting headshots.

20:23.333 --> 20:24.533
- Mm-hmm.

20:24.633 --> 20:25.900
- Should get
some on the freeway.

20:26.000 --> 20:27.667
- Yeah, be, like,
in a shopping cart

20:27.767 --> 20:30.000
holding a golf club.
All the looks.

20:32.133 --> 20:34.067
- Breakfast.
Just having breakfast together.

20:34.167 --> 20:36.233
You knew about this?

20:36.333 --> 20:38.167
- Yeah, and it totally worked.

20:38.267 --> 20:39.700
He's, like,
the best actor of all time.

20:39.800 --> 20:42.900
- Yeah. I've been studying
at this actors repertory

20:43.000 --> 20:46.300
that's also a cult
for about four years now.

20:46.400 --> 20:49.100
- I--this man held us hostage
with a gun.

20:49.200 --> 20:51.133
- Ugh, prop gun,
you drama queen.

20:51.233 --> 20:52.800
Oh!

20:54.500 --> 20:56.300
Oh, my God!

20:56.400 --> 20:58.400
We all could have died.

20:58.500 --> 21:00.500
- I was, like,
"That's real, that's real,

21:00.600 --> 21:02.100
that's real, that's real."
- "It's real, it's real."

21:02.200 --> 21:03.700
- You pointed it at her first.

21:03.800 --> 21:05.067
- I know, I was, like, boom.
- Don't point it!

21:05.100 --> 21:06.467
- I'm sorry.
It's very real.

21:16.067 --> 21:17.267
- Stop it.
- Oh, McCallister, shh.

21:17.367 --> 21:18.900
My parents are in
the next room.

21:21.900 --> 21:25.367
Oh, I'm scared!

21:25.467 --> 21:27.767
Oh, no!

21:27.867 --> 21:28.667
Let's see
what's in that wallet.
