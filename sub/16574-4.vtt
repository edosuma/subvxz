RED DWARF - S11E04 - OFFICER RIMMER
In memory of J.H.S. SAS MBE - Now there was a lad.

00:39.973 --> 00:42.712
Oh, Inga.

00:43.612 --> 00:45.824
Inga!

00:45.927 --> 00:47.963
Inga!!

00:48.310 --> 00:50.044
Bud, wake up!

00:50.592 --> 00:51.651
Huhm?

00:51.652 --> 00:53.247
Who's Inga?

00:53.739 --> 00:54.799
Just someone I met

00:54.800 --> 00:58.033
at a party thrown by
a giraffe called Gerald.

00:58.825 --> 01:00.273
She wanted me to fly
with her to Paris,

01:00.274 --> 01:03.003
but she had a wooden head
and was afraid of forks.

01:03.716 --> 01:04.983
There's no future in it.

01:05.934 --> 01:08.712
According to Freud's
lexicon of dream symbols,

01:08.713 --> 01:11.239
flying is supposed to be
a metaphor for sex.

01:11.240 --> 01:13.167
Absolute poppycock.

01:13.367 --> 01:15.617
I dream of
flying all the time!

01:17.761 --> 01:19.961
It's certainly nothing
to do with sex.

01:20.688 --> 01:22.132
It's always the same dream.

01:22.133 --> 01:25.602
I'm in a Boeing 727
that can't take off.

01:28.362 --> 01:31.885
I'm sitting there with a tiny
bag of nuts I can't get open.

01:33.179 --> 01:34.648
Then suddenly,

01:34.819 --> 01:36.304
after one giant tug,

01:36.305 --> 01:38.031
and much to
my embarrassment,

01:38.301 --> 01:41.848
the whole bag explodes
over premium economy.

01:43.422 --> 01:44.690
Now tell me -

01:44.691 --> 01:45.843
because I don't see it -

01:45.844 --> 01:49.089
how on Earth is that
anything to do with sex?

01:51.459 --> 01:53.183
Sirs, I'm picking
up something

01:53.184 --> 01:56.088
from the other side
of that asteroid field.

01:56.089 --> 01:57.924
It's a deep-space
explorer ship,

01:57.925 --> 02:00.125
and it's in BIG trouble!

02:49.822 --> 02:51.032
Getting anythin'?

02:51.033 --> 02:52.048
The signal's weak.

02:52.049 --> 02:53.226
The magnetite
in the asteroids is

02:53.227 --> 02:55.362
distorting everything
in the local vicinity.

02:55.363 --> 02:56.975
Try dropping frequencies.

02:56.976 --> 02:58.859
See if we can
circumnavigate the storm.

02:58.860 --> 02:59.938
Try dropping frequencies?

02:59.939 --> 03:01.573
See if we can
circumnavigate the storm?

03:01.574 --> 03:03.240
What are you talking about?!

03:03.241 --> 03:05.006
Ah.
It worked, Sir!

03:06.483 --> 03:07.893
Good call.

03:07.894 --> 03:10.538
Ident details coming in.

03:10.573 --> 03:12.501
It's a Space Corps
deep-space scout ship

03:12.502 --> 03:14.178
gravity antimatter
propulsion engine

03:14.179 --> 03:15.059
state-of-the-art tech-

03:15.060 --> 03:16.937
it's even got one of those
big captainy chairs

03:16.938 --> 03:19.071
with flip-across picnic tray.

03:19.239 --> 03:20.656
I'd kill for one of those.

03:20.657 --> 03:22.898
You could captain your way
through a space battle

03:22.899 --> 03:24.918
and have a TV dinner
at the same time.

03:25.282 --> 03:26.420
Through?

03:26.493 --> 03:28.033
Coming through now, Sir.

03:28.034 --> 03:29.655
According to their manifest,

03:29.656 --> 03:31.048
the crew total is

03:31.049 --> 03:32.710
half.

03:33.909 --> 03:35.209
Half what?

03:35.220 --> 03:36.620
I don't know, Sir.

04:04.421 --> 04:05.621
Hey!

04:05.847 --> 04:08.647
Now it's saying the
total crew is one!

04:08.725 --> 04:10.130
What the hell
is going on?

04:10.131 --> 04:11.494
Ah.
Best guess:

04:11.495 --> 04:13.643
The Nautilus is
bio-printing its crew;

04:13.644 --> 04:16.057
which was fashionable
in the 24th century,

04:16.058 --> 04:18.269
where unmanned ships
were sent into space

04:18.271 --> 04:19.988
and only after
they encountered

04:19.990 --> 04:21.856
a point of interest,
need, or danger

04:21.857 --> 04:23.256
were the crew best
suited for the mission

04:23.257 --> 04:25.716
printed from the
bio library.

04:25.717 --> 04:27.595
These dudes are
going to be human, right?

04:27.596 --> 04:29.020
Human-like.

04:29.021 --> 04:31.661
They're created from
synthetic stem cells.

04:31.662 --> 04:33.319
But like many movie stars,

04:33.320 --> 04:36.777
they'll be incapable of having
children in the normal way.

04:37.458 --> 04:38.394
Also, their lifespan

04:38.395 --> 04:40.505
will only last the length
of their mission.

04:40.506 --> 04:42.505
In this case,
save the Nautilus.

04:42.506 --> 04:43.528
Okay, okay.

04:43.529 --> 04:46.562
We've got pictures
coming through.

04:47.659 --> 04:50.072
This is Captain Edwin Herring
of the SS Nautilus.

04:50.073 --> 04:51.414
Can you read me, over?

04:51.415 --> 04:52.496
Copy, Nautilus.

04:52.497 --> 04:54.627
But there's something wrong
with our video feed.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.084
From our end,
you look like a hideous

04:56.085 --> 04:58.199
19th century circus freak.

04:58.854 --> 04:59.672
Bud!

04:59.673 --> 05:02.816
You look like you're wearing
a toupee made of face!

05:03.799 --> 05:05.718
Yeah - one look at you
and even the Elephant Man

05:05.719 --> 05:08.059
would want to jump
in his mum and dad's bed!

05:08.171 --> 05:10.577
Our bio-printer jammed.
It's faulty.

05:10.578 --> 05:12.836
My face has been printed
on the top of my head.

05:12.837 --> 05:13.697
Any advice?

05:13.698 --> 05:14.540
Yeah.

05:14.541 --> 05:15.874
Don't wear a hat!

05:16.530 --> 05:17.648
What's my situation?

05:17.649 --> 05:19.440
Obviously, it's difficult to see.

05:19.441 --> 05:21.854
It appears Sir,
your engines are burnt out.

05:21.855 --> 05:23.787
And you're drifting
into the heart

05:23.788 --> 05:25.808
of a Class C
asteroid storm.

05:25.809 --> 05:27.477
I'm carrying veranium.

05:27.478 --> 05:29.903
If the storm penetrates
my hull I'm done for,

05:29.904 --> 05:31.867
and so is everything
in the local vicinity.

05:31.868 --> 05:33.012
Can you help?

05:33.013 --> 05:35.990
Our two ships are separated
by the asteroid storm.

05:35.991 --> 05:37.627
We'll never get
'round it in time.

05:37.628 --> 05:38.635
Are you sure?

05:38.636 --> 05:39.667
Of course we're sure.

05:39.668 --> 05:42.090
It's as plain as
the nose on your head.

05:43.105 --> 05:44.517
What about your
escape pods?

05:44.518 --> 05:45.658
Maybe use
one of those?

05:45.659 --> 05:47.520
Too late.
They've escaped.

05:47.521 --> 05:48.569
That's what happens
when we put machines

05:48.570 --> 05:49.603
on artificial intelligence-

05:49.604 --> 05:50.940
They just look after
number one.

05:50.941 --> 05:52.964
Perhaps you should print
some more of your crew, Sir.

05:52.965 --> 05:53.970
Get assistance.

05:53.971 --> 05:57.120
I've just told you my bio-printer's
faulty, you cretin!

05:57.121 --> 05:59.439
My visuals are down-
What's your name crewman!?

05:59.983 --> 06:01.316
Dave Lister, Sir.

06:02.237 --> 06:04.138
Don't speak again Lister.
Understand?

06:04.139 --> 06:04.911
Yes, Sir.

06:04.912 --> 06:06.812
I'm done for,
aren't I?

06:07.053 --> 06:09.130
Sirs, intel coming in.

06:09.131 --> 06:10.448
It's much as I figured.

06:10.449 --> 06:12.073
The nearer the
Nautilus gets to us,

06:12.074 --> 06:14.274
the more we, ourselves,
are in danger.

06:14.285 --> 06:15.646
How'd you make
that one out?

06:15.647 --> 06:18.315
If the Nautilus is destroyed
in its present position,

06:18.316 --> 06:19.343
we're safe.

06:19.344 --> 06:21.637
But when the Nautilus
enters the asteroid storm,

06:21.638 --> 06:22.910
The veranium goes up

06:22.911 --> 06:25.578
and the blast radius
nukes us, too.

06:26.102 --> 06:28.102
We've only got
one option.

06:33.666 --> 06:36.127
He just launched a
mining torpedo at him!

06:36.128 --> 06:37.650
It's too late
to intercept!

06:37.651 --> 06:39.135
Rimmer, what have you done?!

06:39.136 --> 06:40.268
I've just saved
all our necks.

06:40.269 --> 06:41.115
That's what I've done.

06:41.116 --> 06:42.197
It was the only option.

06:42.198 --> 06:44.024
Impact one minute
and counting.

06:44.025 --> 06:44.927
You've got to tell him.

06:44.928 --> 06:46.749
You've got to tell Herring
what you've done!

06:46.750 --> 06:48.552
What? Tell him I've
just nuked his ship?

06:48.553 --> 06:49.319
I'm not telling him that.

06:49.320 --> 06:50.387
Why not?!

06:50.388 --> 06:51.621
He won't like me.

07:01.942 --> 07:03.311
I've been hit!!

07:03.399 --> 07:05.499
I'm spinning out!!

07:09.192 --> 07:10.326
That was the most

07:10.327 --> 07:12.406
insanely, brilliant, ballsiest

07:12.407 --> 07:14.985
tactical maneuver
I've ever witnessed!!

07:14.986 --> 07:16.953
Who fired that missile?!

07:17.232 --> 07:19.623
Me, Sir.
Arnold J. Rimmer.

07:20.743 --> 07:22.537
You mean you
took off my wing

07:22.538 --> 07:25.339
knowing it would knock me
out of the asteroid storm?

07:25.340 --> 07:27.105
That's genius, Rimmer!

07:27.106 --> 07:29.991
They don't call me
"Old Iron Balls" for nothing, Sir.

07:31.626 --> 07:33.726
I owe you my life, man!

07:34.128 --> 07:35.361
What's your rank?

07:35.415 --> 07:36.703
Second Tech, Sir.

07:36.704 --> 07:38.234
Not any longer.

07:38.361 --> 07:40.213
I'm promoting you

07:40.214 --> 07:42.349
to officer, Rimmer!

07:43.154 --> 07:45.542
I'll send the authorization
through now.

07:45.599 --> 07:47.699
I look forward
to meeting you.

07:47.815 --> 07:50.851
We'll head back to Red Dwarf Sir,
and then pick you up.

07:50.852 --> 07:52.537
Officer Rimmer.

07:53.764 --> 07:55.239
After all these years!

07:55.240 --> 07:56.879
Oh, yes!

07:57.636 --> 08:00.078
You are genuine, pedigree,

08:00.079 --> 08:02.570
thoroughbred scum,
aren't you Rimmer.

08:02.571 --> 08:05.723
That's Officer Rimmer to you,
Private Nothing!

08:17.168 --> 08:20.203
To do:
Ramscoop MOT

08:22.065 --> 08:24.812
We're just eight hours from
Captain Herring's ship, Sir.

08:24.813 --> 08:27.702
I also have the paperwork
confirming your promotion.

08:27.703 --> 08:32.058
According to Protocol 712,
there'll need to be an accolade

08:32.059 --> 08:35.227
so that you can be officially
accredited as an officer.

08:35.719 --> 08:37.549
Mmmm,
Simple affair, Kryten.

08:37.549 --> 08:39.780
I don't want anything
too special.

08:39.782 --> 08:41.857
We'll have it in the
Hall of Heroes.

08:43.259 --> 08:44.661
Champagne,
canapes.

08:44.662 --> 08:46.379
Maybe a very quick
six-guns salute.

08:46.380 --> 08:48.280
Let's not get carried away.

08:48.409 --> 08:50.960
And then perhaps
a short tribute - to me.

08:50.961 --> 08:51.986
No more than an hour.

08:51.987 --> 08:54.101
And then I'll outline
my plans

08:54.102 --> 08:56.022
to open a new officers' club
on D deck.

08:56.023 --> 08:57.826
A new officers' club, Sir?

09:00.130 --> 09:02.908
Somewhere with an atmosphere
of understated luxury

09:02.909 --> 09:05.370
where officers can unwind
in their precious hours

09:05.371 --> 09:07.649
away from the
grind of command.

09:07.650 --> 09:08.492
Oh.

09:08.509 --> 09:09.563
So basically, Sir,

09:09.564 --> 09:11.818
you're instigating
a class system.

09:12.429 --> 09:13.529
The "haves" me,

09:13.734 --> 09:15.544
The "have-nots" you lot.

09:16.382 --> 09:17.637
One question, Sir.

09:17.638 --> 09:19.760
The fact that you've been
awarded officer-hood

09:19.761 --> 09:21.643
by an act of
gross deception -

09:21.644 --> 09:24.057
does that in any way
take the sheen off it?

09:24.058 --> 09:25.454
Not really.
No.

09:26.290 --> 09:27.766
It's about getting there, Kryten.

09:27.767 --> 09:29.483
Not how you get there.

09:29.915 --> 09:31.349
I made love to a
beautiful woman

09:31.350 --> 09:32.976
in her apartment
last night.

09:32.977 --> 09:33.928
That's important.

09:33.929 --> 09:35.582
How did you get there,
bike or bus -

09:35.583 --> 09:36.683
Not important.

09:44.802 --> 09:46.768
Zero G Sports.
Where is it?

09:47.131 --> 09:49.814
We were up to match day 4.
Where is it gone?!

09:50.090 --> 09:53.500
Zero G Sports is an
officer only channel?!

09:54.549 --> 09:57.367
Has Rimmer been smegging around
with our TV package?!

09:57.414 --> 09:59.279
We've only got the
lame stations!

10:00.014 --> 10:02.893
Look at it:
24 Hour Knitting channel?!

10:04.020 --> 10:05.253
The Hat channel?!

10:05.473 --> 10:07.320
Amish MTV!

10:08.002 --> 10:09.814
We haven't got the totally,
unnecessarily

10:09.815 --> 10:12.118
massive, repeat sports
package anymore!

10:12.119 --> 10:13.015
Look at this!

10:13.016 --> 10:15.507
Seven ID Seven,
Premier League Croquet

10:15.508 --> 10:17.911
Eastbourne Ladies vs
Gloucester Girls.

10:17.912 --> 10:19.629
It's a grudge match!

10:20.592 --> 10:21.692
Gosh!

10:22.712 --> 10:24.916
It's not too bad.
Hot dog?

10:26.887 --> 10:28.595
Attention,
attention.

10:28.596 --> 10:30.142
Officer Rimmer here.

10:30.143 --> 10:32.155
We'll shortly be
approaching SS Nautilus

10:32.156 --> 10:33.998
to welcome
Captain Herring.

10:34.024 --> 10:35.445
Would all lower orders

10:35.446 --> 10:37.746
please make their way
to B deck.

10:40.702 --> 10:42.269
What the smeg's this?!

10:43.257 --> 10:44.654
Why has the
old service lift

10:44.655 --> 10:46.364
been turned to
the grunts lift?

10:46.551 --> 10:47.813
So the rank and file

10:47.814 --> 10:50.156
can travel between floors
with their own kind.

10:50.157 --> 10:52.076
Meantime, you use
the officers' lift

10:52.077 --> 10:53.879
which we can't use
on account of the fact

10:53.880 --> 10:55.463
that we're not "officery."

10:55.575 --> 10:58.260
It's one of the privileges
of rank, Third Technician.

11:03.231 --> 11:04.019
Gentlemen,

11:04.020 --> 11:06.120
I bid you a
temporary farewell.

11:13.812 --> 11:15.138
A towel, Sir.

11:15.281 --> 11:16.662
Ah, thank you.

11:17.226 --> 11:18.993
Facial mist for you, Sir.

11:19.716 --> 11:20.816
Lovely.

11:23.185 --> 11:26.418
Complimentary executive
beverage for you, Sir.

11:26.639 --> 11:27.739
Most kind.

11:34.098 --> 11:35.181
That'll be all.

11:35.206 --> 11:36.096
Go along.

11:46.563 --> 11:47.663
Floor?

11:48.391 --> 11:49.491
Floor?

11:49.516 --> 11:50.950
I said "floor."

11:50.951 --> 11:51.997
Landing Bay, please.

11:51.998 --> 11:52.898
What?

11:53.412 --> 11:54.294
Landing Bay!

11:54.295 --> 11:56.822
Okay, keep your 'air on,
I'm not deaf, am I?

11:57.691 --> 12:00.814
Has he interfered with the lift
some how and made it ruder?

12:02.704 --> 12:04.459
Have a wonderful
onward journey.

12:04.460 --> 12:07.186
And we look forward to
going down with you again soon.

12:07.187 --> 12:08.488
How enchanting.

12:13.614 --> 12:14.980
How hot was that lift?

12:14.981 --> 12:16.214
My diodes are
almost cooked!

12:16.385 --> 12:17.751
Hey, look at my hair!

12:17.752 --> 12:20.119
I've lost volume,
height, bounce!

12:20.330 --> 12:22.132
No way am I putting up
with this.

12:22.133 --> 12:24.052
A problem, Private Zero?

12:24.429 --> 12:27.162
Rimmer, if you think
for one minute...

12:28.208 --> 12:30.504
Officers' Corridor?
What's this?!

12:30.505 --> 12:33.313
Well Sir, the scutters
referbed the old tube tunnel.

12:33.706 --> 12:35.557
See you at the end
of the corridor.

12:35.558 --> 12:36.994
Bon voyage!

12:42.032 --> 12:44.940
His corridor has got
the best of everything!

12:44.941 --> 12:47.140
Air con,
music?

12:47.970 --> 12:49.070
Look!

12:49.329 --> 12:51.363
He doesn't even have to walk!

13:09.453 --> 13:11.661
Welcome aboard,
Captain Herring.

13:11.662 --> 13:13.885
That's a hell of a
ceiling you've got, Rimmer.

13:13.886 --> 13:15.853
The lattice work's stunning!

13:16.222 --> 13:17.789
You're most kind, Sir.

13:17.886 --> 13:21.233
Not massively important,
but this is our crew:

13:21.814 --> 13:22.914
Cat.

13:23.251 --> 13:24.108
Ah.

13:24.252 --> 13:24.969
Kryten.

13:24.970 --> 13:26.070
Uh-huh.

13:26.257 --> 13:28.319
And Third Technician, Lister.

13:28.320 --> 13:30.980
Ahhh.
Is this Lister?

13:30.981 --> 13:32.003
Ha-ha.

13:32.004 --> 13:35.104
I can tell he's no good
just by feeling him.

13:35.598 --> 13:37.025
I'm on to you, Lister.

13:37.026 --> 13:38.459
Don't think I'm not.

13:40.057 --> 13:41.824
Which reminds me, Rimmer,

13:41.901 --> 13:44.860
I might have been a bit hasty
promoting you to officer.

13:45.149 --> 13:47.169
I should have promoted you
to first lieutenant.

13:47.170 --> 13:48.370
And I have!

13:48.371 --> 13:49.783
Congratulations!

13:50.861 --> 13:52.551
Thank you so much, Sir.

13:52.777 --> 13:55.125
What's the situation with the Nautilus,
Flight Lieutenant?

13:55.626 --> 13:56.727
Oh, that's me.

13:56.728 --> 13:59.194
Uhm, the scutters are
unloading your cargo, Sir.

13:59.195 --> 14:01.342
The ship's done for,
I'm afraid.

14:01.343 --> 14:02.826
Well, the cargo's
safe at least.

14:02.827 --> 14:04.643
That means my mission's up.

14:09.770 --> 14:12.103
How are we going
to get him demoted now?

14:12.277 --> 14:13.377
How, indeed.

14:31.020 --> 14:32.862
Huhm.

14:33.114 --> 14:34.689
Yes, elegant.
Stylish.

14:34.690 --> 14:37.781
This'll suit me and my fellow officers
down to the ground, Kryten.

14:37.782 --> 14:39.320
How are you coming along
with the bio-printer?

14:39.321 --> 14:40.685
Ah.
I've repaired it, Sir.

14:40.686 --> 14:41.755
So soon?
How?

14:41.756 --> 14:43.301
I gave it a good kicking!

14:44.780 --> 14:46.974
I thought you didn't believe
in hitting machines.

14:46.975 --> 14:50.057
Oh, photocopies and printers
are an exception, Sir.

14:50.738 --> 14:52.729
We're just waiting
for it to calibrate.

14:52.837 --> 14:55.641
Good. And then we can start to
bio-print the Nautilus' crew?

14:55.642 --> 14:56.352
Indeed.

14:56.353 --> 14:57.349
Excellent.

14:57.515 --> 14:59.707
I want to print out all those
who ranked below me,

14:59.708 --> 15:01.941
regardless of job
or profession.

15:01.943 --> 15:03.980
Shouldn't we speak
to Mr. Lister, Sir?

15:04.083 --> 15:06.883
Kryten, bio-printing is an
officer-only privilege.

15:06.886 --> 15:08.231
Decisions of
this magnitude

15:08.232 --> 15:10.184
can't be left
to a lowly technician.

15:10.446 --> 15:11.141
Uh, Sir.

15:11.142 --> 15:12.639
Are you familiar
with the

15:12.640 --> 15:15.140
Abraham Lincoln
quotation on power?

15:15.257 --> 15:16.617
Lincoln the president?

15:16.618 --> 15:18.241
He got assassinated
at the theater.

15:18.242 --> 15:19.249
Indeed.

15:19.250 --> 15:21.373
I've never been a fan
of the theater, Kryten.

15:21.578 --> 15:22.786
My mother
used to take me

15:22.787 --> 15:24.706
and some of the most
excruciating hours

15:24.707 --> 15:26.627
of my life have been
spent there.

15:26.652 --> 15:28.102
Sometimes the
greater tragedy is

15:28.103 --> 15:30.484
going to the theater
and NOT getting shot.

15:31.197 --> 15:32.172
You were saying.

15:32.173 --> 15:33.593
Lincoln once said,

15:33.658 --> 15:35.952
If you want to test
a man's character,

15:35.953 --> 15:37.397
give him power.

15:37.398 --> 15:38.631
And Officer Rimmer
once said

15:38.632 --> 15:40.045
if you want to
feel my boot

15:40.046 --> 15:41.043
up your recharge socket,

15:41.044 --> 15:42.144
keep talking.

15:49.036 --> 15:51.227
So we can print out
any of these people?

15:51.243 --> 15:52.063
Yeah.

15:52.393 --> 15:53.727
What about her?

15:54.685 --> 15:55.955
A fitness ball lady

15:55.956 --> 15:57.523
in tight Lycra shorts.

15:58.046 --> 15:59.509
She can't demote anybody.

15:59.570 --> 16:00.546
So what if she can't?

16:00.547 --> 16:02.180
I can see past that!

16:03.131 --> 16:03.856
Sirs!

16:03.857 --> 16:06.337
No! Wait-wait-wait-wait-wait!
Go back! Go back! Go back!

16:06.581 --> 16:07.681
That's you!!

16:08.222 --> 16:09.322
That's me!

16:09.652 --> 16:10.819
How is that me?!

16:11.064 --> 16:13.641
Your genome is in
the Nautilus' database?

16:13.642 --> 16:14.577
D-what?

16:14.578 --> 16:15.678
How?!

16:15.853 --> 16:16.962
Ah.

16:17.773 --> 16:18.873
Ha.

16:19.843 --> 16:20.878
Ah.

16:21.114 --> 16:22.160
Ha.

16:22.161 --> 16:24.602
I think I might have
flogged it.

16:24.924 --> 16:26.842
You flogged your genome?!

16:27.393 --> 16:28.903
Yeah, I was a kid
and my mate,

16:28.904 --> 16:30.749
Dodgy offered me
100 dollar pounds

16:30.798 --> 16:32.765
and a half a packet
of fags for it.

16:32.852 --> 16:34.943
All you have to do is put
some saliva on a stick.

16:34.944 --> 16:37.059
You sold the rights to
your unique haploid

16:37.060 --> 16:38.660
set of chromosomes, Sir?

16:38.694 --> 16:41.628
You traded away the
map categorizing

16:41.629 --> 16:43.784
every detail  of
your genetic make up

16:43.934 --> 16:48.234
for 100 dollar pounds
and half a packet of fags?!

16:52.398 --> 16:54.475
You think he should have
held out for a whole pack?

16:56.935 --> 16:59.604
Sir, this means someone else
holds the copyright to you.

16:59.605 --> 17:01.485
You don't own yourself!

17:01.597 --> 17:03.032
What, like every time
I take a leak,

17:03.033 --> 17:04.523
I'm handling
stolen goods?

17:05.673 --> 17:07.756
Look, we're 3 million years
into the big black.

17:07.757 --> 17:09.685
No one's coming out here.
Who cares?!

17:09.685 --> 17:11.928
Exactly.
We're coooool!

17:11.929 --> 17:15.011
Sir, I don't think you appreciate
what you've done!

17:17.028 --> 17:18.589
Thousands of
different companies

17:18.590 --> 17:21.806
have taken out a license
to produce yous.

17:22.089 --> 17:24.579
You're like writing software
that people can buy,

17:24.580 --> 17:25.913
and then use as they like.

17:26.050 --> 17:27.724
What, and do what
they want with?

17:28.009 --> 17:29.109
Here's one.

17:29.493 --> 17:31.116
License 10 years.

17:31.165 --> 17:32.732
3,000 Listers -

17:32.733 --> 17:36.893
Sandex Communication Listers,
to be used in call centers.

17:39.496 --> 17:40.550
Do you mean all those

17:40.551 --> 17:43.219
smart-ass scousers in the
call centers are me?!

17:45.463 --> 17:46.882
I've had those Johnnies-

17:46.883 --> 17:48.140
They're a pain in the backside!

17:48.141 --> 17:49.335
They know nothing

17:49.336 --> 17:50.983
and they sound like they
don't want to be there.

17:50.984 --> 17:52.949
They don't, Sir.
They're you!

17:54.022 --> 17:55.788
What have you done, Bud?!

17:56.006 --> 17:58.354
So Rimmer is going to
use this machine

17:58.355 --> 18:00.431
to produce people
who will obey him.

18:00.816 --> 18:01.791
Never being born

18:01.814 --> 18:04.114
has got to be better
than a life like that.

18:04.314 --> 18:06.265
We've got to wipe
the database, Kryten.

18:06.283 --> 18:07.662
Delete it all.
Right now.

18:07.671 --> 18:09.005
I can't, Sir.

18:09.148 --> 18:11.912
I have to print out a
new crew as instructed.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.973
Now Mr. Rimmer's our
flight lieutenant,

18:13.974 --> 18:15.520
I can't refuse his orders!

18:15.521 --> 18:17.661
Well I'll do it.
Just tell me what to do!

18:17.662 --> 18:18.457
Sir!

18:18.458 --> 18:20.299
If you think I'm going to

18:20.300 --> 18:22.517
select all these files

18:25.284 --> 18:27.384
and then take my leave,

18:27.665 --> 18:29.506
taking my leave,

18:29.524 --> 18:32.121
so you can press
that button there,

18:33.022 --> 18:35.322
you've got another
think coming!

18:41.870 --> 18:44.241
The entire database has
deleted itself?!

18:44.868 --> 18:46.125
Check bio-printer.

18:46.126 --> 18:48.497
This is going down on my
daily to-do list.

18:48.835 --> 18:49.568
How?

18:49.569 --> 18:50.605
It's a mystery, Sir.

18:50.606 --> 18:52.574
I bet Lister's behind this.

18:52.575 --> 18:54.136
Isn't it possible
to print anyone?

18:54.137 --> 18:55.464
I need a crew to command!

18:55.465 --> 18:56.806
Well, in theory it is possible

18:56.807 --> 19:00.166
to insert a piece of DNA
into the bio-printer

19:00.167 --> 19:01.734
and have it produce a genome,

19:01.735 --> 19:03.178
but who would we print?!

19:03.545 --> 19:05.783
My mind's on file
in the holosuite,

19:05.784 --> 19:08.063
And my DNAs on all
my old belongings.

19:08.231 --> 19:09.425
With the remaining bio-ink,

19:09.426 --> 19:11.403
we could produce
50 versions of me.

19:11.428 --> 19:12.750
Make them all officers,

19:12.751 --> 19:14.846
so as flight lieutenant
I'm over them,

19:14.847 --> 19:15.635
and then,

19:15.636 --> 19:18.931
we can have an officers' club
crammed full of Rimmers!

19:19.054 --> 19:22.621
Sir, history tells us that
you and you is a very bad mix.

19:22.725 --> 19:25.197
You and 50 yous
is beyond horrific!

19:25.496 --> 19:27.527
Not if I'm their
commanding officer.

19:27.528 --> 19:29.258
Then they'll do
what I want.

19:29.643 --> 19:31.486
Move the bio-printer to
one of the junk rooms

19:31.487 --> 19:32.797
and double security!

19:32.961 --> 19:35.889
Things are about to get
a whole lot more Rimmery!

19:43.476 --> 19:44.381
You what?

19:44.382 --> 19:45.528
Officers' Club?

19:48.085 --> 19:49.487
Evening.
Evening.

19:49.934 --> 19:51.234
Evening.
Evening.

19:51.380 --> 19:52.480
Evening

19:52.653 --> 19:53.557
Evening.

19:53.567 --> 19:54.176
Evening.

19:54.177 --> 19:55.268
Where they come from?

19:55.269 --> 19:57.002
He's bio-printing Rimmers!

19:57.003 --> 19:59.103
We've got to kill that damn machine
before he prints any more!

20:15.912 --> 20:19.167
Ah, gentlemen - welcome.
Do you have a reservation?

20:20.863 --> 20:22.214
Where's the bio-printer, Rimmer?

20:22.215 --> 20:23.649
Is it here,
'cause we're going in.

20:23.650 --> 20:26.767
I'm afraid I can't let you in
unless you're on the list.

20:26.768 --> 20:27.868
Let me see.

20:30.123 --> 20:31.694
Stop screwin' around, Rimmer.

20:31.863 --> 20:33.729
Have you moved
the bio-printer

20:33.730 --> 20:35.526
to somewhere in the
Officers' Club?

20:35.527 --> 20:37.228
Sorry.
You don't appear to be here.

20:37.665 --> 20:39.976
Rimmer. Party of two.
Eight thirty PM.

20:39.977 --> 20:41.052
Come in.

20:41.053 --> 20:42.208
How lovely
to see you again!

20:42.209 --> 20:43.668
Nice to see you.

20:45.452 --> 20:47.085
How many did he print!?

20:47.395 --> 20:48.729
Rimmer party.

20:48.801 --> 20:50.493
Four?
Straight through.

20:50.494 --> 20:52.685
Cloakroom's on the left.
Enjoy!

20:53.189 --> 20:55.822
How many have you printed,
you Smeghead?!

20:56.015 --> 20:58.113
You can't use
bio ink to print

20:58.114 --> 20:59.214
more Rims, Rimmer.

20:59.372 --> 21:02.739
Yeah. We need that ink
to print proper people!

21:03.349 --> 21:04.658
Hey, what the hell is this?!

21:04.659 --> 21:06.759
We're the Barbershop Quartet!

21:06.962 --> 21:08.281
Any ID?

21:22.258 --> 21:24.678
Mr. Rimmer,

21:25.039 --> 21:27.332
We are what we seem,

21:27.341 --> 21:31.347
The cutest quartet
that you've ever seen.

21:31.810 --> 21:33.565
We've got four mouths,

21:33.566 --> 21:35.525
a duet times two,

21:36.472 --> 21:40.261
this barbershop quartet
is singing for you!

21:40.821 --> 21:42.805
That,
is entertainment.

21:42.806 --> 21:44.028
In ya go.

21:44.085 --> 21:45.584
I've had enough of
this tossing about.

21:45.585 --> 21:46.529
Come on, we're going in.

21:46.530 --> 21:47.685
I've got the cravat!

21:47.827 --> 21:48.521
Hey!

21:48.718 --> 21:49.818
Hey.

21:52.520 --> 21:54.041
Ah.
Hot towel, Sir?

21:54.042 --> 21:54.751
Move!

21:54.752 --> 21:56.117
Facial spray?

21:56.198 --> 21:57.064
Enough!

21:57.065 --> 21:58.421
They've barged their way
into the Officers' Club

21:58.422 --> 21:59.617
and I need some bouncers.

21:59.618 --> 22:01.570
Print four more mes
and make them huge,

22:01.571 --> 22:02.413
muscly and brave.

22:02.414 --> 22:03.562
Can the bio-printer do that?

22:03.563 --> 22:04.304
In theory, Sir.

22:04.305 --> 22:07.265
Complimentary
Executive Corridor beverage, Sir?

22:07.266 --> 22:08.631
Don't start!

22:11.239 --> 22:12.969
Adjustments made, Sir.

22:16.760 --> 22:17.868
Why isn't it printing?

22:18.026 --> 22:21.209
Well, the new settings need
extra time to calibrate, Sir.

22:21.360 --> 22:23.458
We'll just have to be
a little bit patient.

22:23.459 --> 22:25.106
I have been patient!

22:27.636 --> 22:29.156
What's wrong with it -
the damn thing!

22:29.157 --> 22:30.257
Come on!!

22:32.694 --> 22:34.450
Come on, come on,
come on!

22:34.995 --> 22:36.095
Last.

22:40.407 --> 22:42.794
The first one's got stuck.
We need a midwife!

22:42.795 --> 22:44.962
We'll have to
do it ourselves!

22:47.785 --> 22:49.216
Pull, Kryten!

22:49.218 --> 22:50.758
Pull me.
Pull!

23:02.035 --> 23:04.068
What the hell
is that thing?!

23:08.166 --> 23:09.266
Come on!!

23:45.248 --> 23:47.247
Officer's lift on floor 15, Sir!

23:47.248 --> 23:49.214
We've got to take the grunts!

23:51.888 --> 23:53.356
Get me out of here, pronto!

23:53.357 --> 23:54.957
I'm busy, okay?

23:54.998 --> 23:56.294
Just close the doors!

23:56.295 --> 23:57.981
There's a deranged
version of me out there!

23:57.982 --> 23:59.749
There's one in here, too.

24:00.216 --> 24:03.128
I'll take the stairs, Sir.
We've got to tell the others!

24:08.029 --> 24:09.778
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry!

24:09.779 --> 24:11.903
Just close the doors, please!

24:11.904 --> 24:13.228
Hold the lift!

24:13.488 --> 24:15.321
Don't close!
Wait for me!

24:18.144 --> 24:19.385
Officers quarters now!

24:19.386 --> 24:21.929
Okay, keep your 'air on
I'm not deaf, am I?

24:28.472 --> 24:29.206
Right!

24:29.207 --> 24:31.033
I've rigged up
a monitor wirelessly

24:31.034 --> 24:32.601
from the CCTV footage.

24:32.993 --> 24:35.508
From this, we can see where
the Rimmer monster is

24:35.509 --> 24:36.942
and what it's doing.

24:39.790 --> 24:42.157
It's coming to the officers' deck!

24:49.341 --> 24:50.247
Let me in!

24:50.248 --> 24:51.622
Are you on the list?

24:51.623 --> 24:53.215
If you're name's not down,
you can't come in.

24:53.216 --> 24:54.231
Riffraff only.

24:54.232 --> 24:55.450
I'm going to get absorbed!

24:55.451 --> 24:56.700
You're going to have to admit
you're a grunt.

24:56.701 --> 24:57.584
Total grunt.

24:57.585 --> 24:59.856
Your going to have to resign
your first lieutenant-ship.

24:59.857 --> 25:01.840
But I worked so hard for it!

25:01.841 --> 25:03.283
You did nothing!

25:03.284 --> 25:05.712
But I did it so well!!

25:07.894 --> 25:09.915
Okay, okay!
I resign!!

25:10.003 --> 25:11.915
Just let me in!

25:14.487 --> 25:17.571
Stand back,
Technician 2.0

25:20.783 --> 25:22.069
What is that thing?

25:22.070 --> 25:24.053
The human body is
built of cells.

25:24.054 --> 25:26.100
with specific
fixed rolls, Sir.

25:26.101 --> 25:27.444
Stem cells,
on the other hand

25:27.445 --> 25:29.513
can become any other
type of cell.

25:29.632 --> 25:31.741
What, reprogrammable?

25:31.742 --> 25:33.137
So when the
printer jammed

25:33.138 --> 25:35.590
and did a mash-up of all
the countless Rimmers,

25:35.591 --> 25:38.497
it didn't just combine the
sum of your parts physically,

25:38.498 --> 25:40.794
it amalgamated
all your faults.

25:40.795 --> 25:42.128
I've got faults?

25:42.529 --> 25:43.872
Your lust for power,

25:43.873 --> 25:45.965
your impatience,
your insecurity,

25:45.966 --> 25:48.330
your stupidity,
your greed,

25:48.331 --> 25:49.377
your arrogance,

25:49.378 --> 25:49.971
Yes - thank you, Kryten.

25:49.972 --> 25:51.573
and ordered
these stem cells

25:51.574 --> 25:54.524
to make a creature to
accommodate them all.

25:56.237 --> 25:57.737
So how do we kill it?

25:57.737 --> 25:59.752
I have an idea, Sir.

25:59.753 --> 26:02.453
But it does involve
using you as bait.

26:03.412 --> 26:05.093
I love it already!

26:28.938 --> 26:30.943
We'll have to go the
long way around!

26:45.515 --> 26:46.796
We can't shoot!

26:46.797 --> 26:48.827
We might take out
Mr. Rimmer!

26:48.828 --> 26:50.678
And the downside
of that is...?

26:51.813 --> 26:52.913
I've got it.
Hey!

26:53.157 --> 26:54.146
What are you doing?

26:54.147 --> 26:56.834
We are going to absorb
the final Rimmer.

26:56.835 --> 26:57.724
Oh aye.

26:57.725 --> 26:58.974
Then what you
going to do?

26:58.975 --> 27:00.608
We haven't decided yet.

27:00.996 --> 27:03.011
What?
Do you not make a to-do list?

27:03.012 --> 27:05.386
We need to make
a to-do list?

27:05.387 --> 27:08.211
You should always
make a to-do list!

27:08.236 --> 27:10.048
Have you got a pen?

27:10.049 --> 27:12.148
We always have a pen.

27:16.143 --> 27:17.852
Well then,
write that list.

27:19.221 --> 27:21.866
Oh, and don't forget
to put the last thing

27:21.867 --> 27:24.186
you're going to be doing
on that list.

27:26.102 --> 27:27.420
What's that?

27:27.554 --> 27:29.623
Dying!!

28:13.041 --> 28:17.946
Thank you, Leo,
for clarifying the lift's dialog!
