03:10.274 --> 03:11.357
Quickly!

03:30.419 --> 03:31.878
It's the Silk Road Protection Squad.

03:40.596 --> 03:41.888
Stop fighting!

03:41.972 --> 03:43.014
Brother, stop fighting!

03:43.098 --> 03:44.932
Fight!

03:45.017 --> 03:47.351
We'll handle this.

03:47.436 --> 03:49.103
Brother, stop fighting.

03:49.187 --> 03:50.605
I beg you.

03:58.655 --> 04:02.909
My Hun brothers, I come in peace!

04:03.660 --> 04:06.203
What does this have to do with
the Silk Road Protection Squad?

04:06.496 --> 04:09.206
Our mission has always been

04:09.333 --> 04:11.751
to turn foes into friends

04:12.044 --> 04:13.419
and to attain peace for all races.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.671
Whatever our friends
on the Silk Road need,

04:15.756 --> 04:17.882
it's our responsibility to help.

04:18.466 --> 04:21.177
Survival of the fittest
is the only truth on the Silk Road.

04:21.637 --> 04:25.890
You want to control all 36 nations here
with your pathetic little band?

04:26.224 --> 04:27.391
Anyway, he already lost.

04:27.517 --> 04:29.477
He called me a savage!

04:36.026 --> 04:38.444
Success doesn't depend
on how many you are,

04:38.528 --> 04:39.779
but on how determined you are.

04:40.781 --> 04:41.781
Let go.

04:43.033 --> 04:44.075
Let go!

04:47.579 --> 04:48.579
Huns!

04:51.166 --> 04:52.166
My lady!

04:54.002 --> 04:55.002
My lady!

05:17.651 --> 05:20.069
I'm sorry, that wasn't intentional.

05:21.863 --> 05:22.863
Get your sword out.

05:22.948 --> 05:24.407
We'll follow the code.

05:25.742 --> 05:28.786
The Protection Squad
follows the laws of our country.

05:29.538 --> 05:30.663
We don't fight.

06:05.615 --> 06:06.657
Come here!

06:06.867 --> 06:07.908
No!

06:43.445 --> 06:44.445
My lady!

07:06.551 --> 07:07.635
Lady Cold Moon!

07:08.428 --> 07:10.054
I didn't mean to remove your veil.

07:10.555 --> 07:11.889
You dropped it yourself.

07:12.432 --> 07:13.682
I know.

07:14.184 --> 07:15.184
It was fate.

07:16.353 --> 07:18.145
Actually, I'm here because...

07:18.230 --> 07:19.230
Drink.

07:23.902 --> 07:24.902
I'm ready.

07:32.744 --> 07:34.995
I just wanted to return your veil.

07:35.080 --> 07:36.705
I didn't see anything.

07:36.790 --> 07:38.541
Nothing happened between us.

07:46.675 --> 07:48.092
Stop laughing!

07:48.176 --> 07:50.386
We haven't been home
in a long time. Let's go!

08:02.983 --> 08:04.525
THE LITTLE SCHOOL

08:10.490 --> 08:13.993
Wind and sand, please send him back

08:14.369 --> 08:20.958
Tell him I really miss him

08:21.751 --> 08:25.379
Wind and sand, please promise me

08:25.463 --> 08:27.464
He will come home

08:33.847 --> 08:36.557
For the past few months,
I've been giving my wages

08:36.640 --> 08:38.267
to my injured brothers.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.070
I know.

08:50.155 --> 08:51.697
You take such good care of your men.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.199
We'll manage.

08:54.367 --> 08:57.620
I know people laugh at you
for marrying a Huns man.

08:57.704 --> 09:00.206
There you go again.

09:00.332 --> 09:02.041
I love you because we're the same.

09:02.250 --> 09:04.293
We believe in equality for all races.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.837
You preach peace among
the different races on the Silk Road,

09:06.922 --> 09:09.381
and I teach peace to children
from different tribes at school.

09:09.674 --> 09:11.467
We're bound to succeed.

09:21.853 --> 09:23.687
- Captain!
- Yin Po.

09:23.772 --> 09:25.397
The Protection Squad is in trouble.

09:25.482 --> 09:28.275
The Prefecture Chief's army

09:28.360 --> 09:32.112
found four boxes of gold coins
outside the border.

09:37.369 --> 09:40.663
There's a customs clearance
document inside.

09:40.747 --> 09:41.747
Signed by who?

09:45.210 --> 09:46.335
The Protection Squad.

10:00.016 --> 10:01.016
Captain.

10:04.396 --> 10:05.396
Lieutenant.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.064
What crime have we committed?

10:07.148 --> 10:08.357
Why have you locked up my men?

10:08.525 --> 10:12.152
The Protection Squad is under
the Prefecture Chief's jurisdiction.

10:14.739 --> 10:16.156
Don't move!

10:24.207 --> 10:26.375
This has nothing to do with them.

10:26.459 --> 10:27.668
Take me.

10:29.212 --> 10:31.213
By order of the Prefecture Chief,

10:31.298 --> 10:35.301
Huo An and his Protection Squad
are under arrest for gold smuggling.

10:36.344 --> 10:40.848
They will be sent to Wild Geese Gate
tomorrow morning to rebuild the city.

10:59.409 --> 11:00.451
What a crook.

11:01.494 --> 11:03.412
Sending us to the border

11:03.496 --> 11:05.456
so they can blame
the smuggled gold on us.

11:05.540 --> 11:07.207
We've been exiled!

11:07.334 --> 11:09.752
Wild Geese Gate is for prisoners
serving life sentences.

11:09.836 --> 11:12.713
Once you go in, there's no way out.
This is so unfair.

11:12.797 --> 11:14.673
What are you going to do about it?

11:15.592 --> 11:16.633
Look, brothers.

11:17.052 --> 11:20.554
We were once rescued by General Huo
from the Wild Geese Gate.

11:21.723 --> 11:24.391
We should take this opportunity
to pay our respects to him.

11:25.810 --> 11:26.977
Right.

11:40.325 --> 11:41.742
Move!

11:49.209 --> 11:51.126
- Keep moving!
- Move! Next!

12:13.358 --> 12:16.402
HAN DYNASTY
GENERAL HUO QUBING'S SHRINE

12:32.085 --> 12:34.461
One! Two!

12:34.546 --> 12:35.796
Higher!

12:45.181 --> 12:46.306
Quick. Help the injured!

12:52.021 --> 12:53.564
What an idiot!

12:55.275 --> 12:56.608
Captain, are you all right?

12:56.693 --> 12:57.734
I'm fine.

12:57.819 --> 12:59.278
Help them!

12:59.362 --> 13:01.196
Help them.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.990
It's all their fault! Get them!

13:03.074 --> 13:04.074
Stop!

13:04.159 --> 13:05.868
Come on! Fight!

13:07.787 --> 13:08.996
What are you doing?

13:18.840 --> 13:20.215
Stop!

13:25.430 --> 13:26.430
Stop fighting!

13:31.769 --> 13:32.895
Stop fighting!

13:43.907 --> 13:45.240
Stop!

13:49.704 --> 13:51.705
Stop!

13:52.499 --> 13:54.458
Everyone stop fighting!

13:54.751 --> 13:55.834
Get back to work!

13:55.919 --> 13:57.294
Stop now!

13:57.962 --> 13:59.671
Protection Squad, come here.

14:11.434 --> 14:13.227
I don't care
about the Protection Squad.

14:14.479 --> 14:16.146
This is the Wild Geese Gate.

14:19.943 --> 14:22.569
Huo An,
under the Prefecture Chief's orders,

14:22.654 --> 14:24.696
we have to finish rebuilding the city,

14:25.365 --> 14:27.824
so you bunch of losers need to hurry up.

14:29.410 --> 14:32.162
Come back here!
I'm not finished with you!

15:13.079 --> 15:15.747
Legion!

15:15.832 --> 15:17.332
We stop!

15:20.295 --> 15:21.503
What do you think, General?

15:24.507 --> 15:25.716
What is our current condition?

15:25.800 --> 15:27.509
Close to 800 soldiers.

15:27.594 --> 15:30.846
Three thousands bows
and crossbows altogether.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.348
- Horses are thirsty and near exhaustion.
- Yes.

15:33.433 --> 15:36.233
If we're gonna have a chance,
we need to take them as soon as possible.

15:54.037 --> 15:55.037
Lucius.

15:56.164 --> 15:57.164
Lucius.

15:58.541 --> 16:00.709
- Lucius.
- Yes, I'm here.

16:03.087 --> 16:06.882
Falco says that
you are going to take the city.

16:06.966 --> 16:11.970
Yes, but their captain is very weak,
and he doesn't look too bright,

16:12.055 --> 16:14.139
so it won't take long.

16:14.223 --> 16:15.557
Let's have a drink.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.980
I'll wait for your good news
when you return.

16:23.900 --> 16:26.151
We're at a new city, place to rest.

16:40.333 --> 16:41.333
Intruders.

16:53.388 --> 16:55.222
Listen to me if you want to live.

16:59.936 --> 17:00.936
This way.

17:09.820 --> 17:10.820
Sound the drums!

17:32.885 --> 17:35.262
Halt!

18:07.462 --> 18:12.048
I'm Lucius, Commanding General
Black Eagle Corps, Roman Empire.

18:12.717 --> 18:13.717
Huo An.

18:14.343 --> 18:17.804
General, is there any way no fight?

18:18.473 --> 18:19.473
No.

18:20.141 --> 18:21.141
Go there.

18:23.686 --> 18:24.686
No.

19:34.382 --> 19:38.176
General Lucius is fighting
like a real demigod today.

19:38.261 --> 19:42.138
I don't think there's a man alive that
could stand against our mighty general.

20:29.312 --> 20:30.312
Look!

20:30.396 --> 20:31.396
Sandstorm!

20:31.480 --> 20:33.231
Look out! Sandstorm!

20:36.235 --> 20:38.111
It's a sandstorm!

20:58.215 --> 21:01.259
General!

21:10.394 --> 21:11.561
Hey, listen to me.

21:11.646 --> 21:13.104
Hey! Hey, stop!

21:13.189 --> 21:15.106
- What?
- Stop! Listen!

21:16.442 --> 21:19.653
Sandstorm coming. Stop fighting.

21:20.571 --> 21:21.947
Drop your weapon.

21:22.615 --> 21:23.990
I'll let you in.

21:24.075 --> 21:26.451
Or we bury here together.

21:28.788 --> 21:29.788
The boy, too.

21:54.772 --> 21:57.482
We need food and water for my men.

21:58.734 --> 22:00.485
Medicine for a child.

22:02.863 --> 22:04.364
And I need a place to think.

23:03.466 --> 23:04.799
Lucius!

23:04.925 --> 23:06.593
- Lucius.
- Here. Here.

23:06.677 --> 23:07.802
I'm here.

23:10.222 --> 23:14.350
Did you win the battle
against the Chinese warrior?

23:23.652 --> 23:24.652
He won.

23:27.364 --> 23:29.157
Yes! I knew you'd win.

23:29.241 --> 23:33.203
Because you said
the Chinese captain was terrible,

23:33.287 --> 23:35.705
and he even looked stupid.

24:30.553 --> 24:32.178
Go! Go!

24:48.279 --> 24:49.779
- You drink?
- Of course.

24:51.448 --> 24:53.575
You ever meet a soldier
who doesn't drink?

25:00.457 --> 25:01.457
Strong.

25:05.296 --> 25:07.213
Yes, it's lovely.

25:14.096 --> 25:15.763
Where you go tomorrow?

25:17.057 --> 25:19.517
This is a question
I've been thinking about constantly.

25:21.979 --> 25:23.855
In Rome,

25:23.939 --> 25:27.692
we are trained to obey, to serve,
since we are very young.

25:29.236 --> 25:32.030
When you finally get the opportunity
to chose your own path,

25:32.114 --> 25:34.908
you realize there's nowhere to go.

25:38.120 --> 25:39.871
Do Chinese soldiers feel the same way?

25:41.665 --> 25:43.082
No, we're different.

25:43.167 --> 25:44.000
Why?

25:44.126 --> 25:46.294
You train kill people.

25:46.378 --> 25:48.671
We train to save people.

25:48.756 --> 25:50.381
I make Silk Road peace.

25:51.425 --> 25:53.176
Peace is a dream.

25:56.889 --> 25:59.724
I just wanna look at it.
I've never seen a Chinese sword.

26:05.522 --> 26:07.106
What's the Chinese word for revenge?

26:08.317 --> 26:09.150
What?

26:09.235 --> 26:10.610
Someone hurts you or your family,

26:10.694 --> 26:13.071
you kill them. Revenge.

26:13.989 --> 26:16.699
- Vengeance is...
- Vengeance.

26:20.746 --> 26:22.121
Why you want fùchóu?

26:23.749 --> 26:24.999
This is not your business.

26:25.084 --> 26:28.878
Anything happen in Silk Road

26:28.963 --> 26:30.505
is my business.

26:30.589 --> 26:32.257
Fùchóu makes more hate.

26:32.341 --> 26:34.926
Today, we meet. We are friend.

26:36.720 --> 26:37.720
I want to help you.

26:42.309 --> 26:45.186
When we leave tomorrow,
I may never see you again.

26:46.355 --> 26:48.481
You make a friend today.
You lose one tomorrow.

26:50.609 --> 26:51.609
Is it worth it?

26:53.988 --> 26:54.988
Huo An!

26:55.656 --> 26:57.573
We're doomed!

26:57.658 --> 26:59.867
I just got the order
from the Prefecture Chief.

26:59.952 --> 27:02.954
We have to finish restoring
Wild Geese Gate in 15 days.

27:03.038 --> 27:05.039
Otherwise we're all going
to be executed.

27:05.124 --> 27:08.042
Even if everyone works at full speed,

27:08.127 --> 27:10.169
it would still take half a year
to complete.

27:10.254 --> 27:12.130
Aren't you close to the 36 nations?

27:12.214 --> 27:13.840
Please help me recruit more people.

27:17.594 --> 27:19.137
This one's always upset.

27:21.056 --> 27:24.350
We can rebuild the city,
and within 15 days.

27:24.435 --> 27:26.311
They say they can complete it
within 15 days.

27:26.395 --> 27:28.521
It'll take a long time
to gather the stones

27:28.605 --> 27:29.981
and even longer to transport them.

27:30.065 --> 27:32.317
That's a lot of big stone.

27:32.401 --> 27:34.444
Difficult to move up.

27:34.528 --> 27:36.612
You have plenty of gravel
outside the city.

27:36.697 --> 27:38.656
Gravel. Do you understand?

27:40.617 --> 27:43.244
He said there are a lot of small stones
outside the city.

27:43.329 --> 27:45.288
How do you build a city wall
with gravel?

27:45.539 --> 27:48.541
Huo An, listen to me.
Trusting them is a mistake.

27:49.626 --> 27:50.460
He trusts you.

27:50.544 --> 27:51.544
Thank you.

27:52.546 --> 27:54.380
You must promise me one thing in return.

27:56.592 --> 28:00.136
Find men to guide my deputies
to the Parthian Empire.

28:11.106 --> 28:12.315
Okay, look.

28:12.399 --> 28:13.691
We're here,

28:15.110 --> 28:16.778
and the Parthian Empire is here.

29:15.379 --> 29:17.547
Fifteen days. Is it possible?

29:25.055 --> 29:26.681
Hey! Stop it!

29:26.765 --> 29:28.057
Stop it!

29:33.188 --> 29:34.230
Good. Go.

29:34.314 --> 29:35.314
Go!

29:40.028 --> 29:41.529
See? Much easier.

29:44.408 --> 29:46.284
Slow down, one at a time.

29:46.368 --> 29:47.452
Take it and move on.

29:48.704 --> 29:49.704
Everything's on schedule

30:15.105 --> 30:16.981
Pull!

30:58.899 --> 31:01.108
Lower. A bit more. That's it.

31:02.402 --> 31:04.946
Tell me, what kind of city is this?

31:05.030 --> 31:10.409
From where you're standing now,
you can see the entire, famous Silk Road,

31:11.787 --> 31:13.788
that great artery of trade and culture

31:13.872 --> 31:17.667
that connects the West
to the great kingdoms of the East.

31:17.751 --> 31:19.043
When the sun sets,

31:19.127 --> 31:23.214
the entire Silk Road, even the city walls,
become very, very warm.

31:24.299 --> 31:26.592
I want to touch the city wall.

31:40.315 --> 31:41.315
I can see it.

31:42.484 --> 31:43.818
I can see them all.

31:45.654 --> 31:48.197
I can see our own city gate.

31:50.075 --> 31:53.703
And the place you taught me
how to use a sword.

32:11.346 --> 32:12.346
Hey!

32:15.726 --> 32:16.726
Let's go.

32:17.519 --> 32:18.519
Training.

33:19.581 --> 33:20.581
Positions!

35:01.767 --> 35:02.892
Nicely done.

35:51.024 --> 35:52.024
Hey!

36:00.325 --> 36:01.325
Thank you for the match.

36:23.390 --> 36:24.890
That was a great fight!

36:45.328 --> 36:47.037
Wait. Check again.

37:06.725 --> 37:08.058
My brothers on the Silk Road,

37:08.143 --> 37:09.894
let's make our own flags.

37:09.978 --> 37:12.313
Once the city is restored,
we will raise them up together.

37:12.397 --> 37:13.731
Good.

37:18.236 --> 37:19.820
What are you drawing?

37:23.742 --> 37:25.326
Excellent, young master.

39:07.012 --> 39:09.388
We need to prepare
for the flag ceremony quickly.

39:09.472 --> 39:10.556
Come on!

39:10.640 --> 39:12.057
Give all my liquor to our brothers!

39:12.267 --> 39:13.267
Drink!

39:15.186 --> 39:16.437
You like their music?

39:25.238 --> 39:29.825
Another glass of wine for courage

39:30.160 --> 39:35.456
In a world of chaos and conflict

39:36.124 --> 39:40.961
No matter how big the obstacle

39:41.546 --> 39:46.300
I swear to turn turmoil into peace

39:46.551 --> 39:52.056
To turn foes into friends

39:52.515 --> 39:57.061
There's no need for weapons

39:57.937 --> 40:02.483
We'll move forward hand in hand

40:03.318 --> 40:08.197
May wars forever end

40:08.907 --> 40:15.329
May wars forever end

40:19.959 --> 40:23.212
I wanna sing! I wanna sing!

40:50.824 --> 40:55.452
Firmly I pledge

40:55.537 --> 41:01.041
My loyalty to thee

41:01.126 --> 41:06.922
Land of my forefathers

41:07.006 --> 41:13.971
Forever brimming with glory

41:15.348 --> 41:20.519
A land of beauty

41:20.603 --> 41:25.190
Home of the courageous

41:25.441 --> 41:30.487
Our eternal Rome

41:30.572 --> 41:37.161
The might of enemy ships

41:38.079 --> 41:43.250
Threatens us in vain

41:43.334 --> 41:48.338
It is a hopeless quest

41:48.423 --> 41:53.468
Turn away from deceit

41:53.553 --> 41:58.140
And sweet delusions

42:01.269 --> 42:05.939
For the trumpets of war

42:06.024 --> 42:10.235
Will call our legions soon

42:11.112 --> 42:15.532
And across the fatherland

42:16.242 --> 42:23.207
A victory song will ring

42:24.083 --> 42:28.962
And across the fatherland

42:29.047 --> 42:34.009
Our song will resonate

42:34.093 --> 42:38.430
A time of joy and pride

42:38.932 --> 42:45.854
For eternal Rome

43:00.411 --> 43:03.997
I served under
Consul Marcus Licinius Crassus Dives.

43:04.666 --> 43:06.458
He moved his troops
to the Parthian Empire.

43:07.293 --> 43:08.669
Formed an alliance with the Queen,

43:09.254 --> 43:11.880
who is the sister of our Lady Crassus.

43:11.965 --> 43:15.884
Consul Marcus's elder son, Tiberius,
is a vicious and treacherous man.

43:15.969 --> 43:20.264
The Consul was planning on naming
his youngest son Publius

43:20.348 --> 43:22.307
to be his heir and successor.

43:22.392 --> 43:24.685
He entrusted me to keep the child alive.

43:25.895 --> 43:27.980
The young lord started having
problems with his eyes.

43:28.564 --> 43:32.276
The Parthian queen kindly sent medicine
to heal his vision.

43:33.361 --> 43:36.363
Tiberius laced it with poison,

43:36.447 --> 43:38.699
blinding his brother
so he could never become Consul.

43:39.409 --> 43:40.617
He then killed his father.

43:41.703 --> 43:42.703
I had no choice

43:43.663 --> 43:45.580
but to take my soldiers and the child,

43:46.332 --> 43:47.332
become a fugitive.

43:48.418 --> 43:50.335
Until I reached the Wild Geese Gate...

43:53.172 --> 43:54.798
I've been a man without a country,

43:55.925 --> 43:57.092
marked for death.

44:00.680 --> 44:03.432
The deputy I sent to the Parthian Empire

44:03.516 --> 44:05.976
is meant to restore the peace treaty.

44:06.060 --> 44:08.395
And to prove Tiberius's
vicious intentions.

44:19.157 --> 44:20.157
I'm orphan.

44:20.783 --> 44:21.783
Hun raids.

44:22.410 --> 44:24.703
My parents killed by enemy.

44:25.872 --> 44:29.041
Me and my sister run away.

44:29.751 --> 44:30.959
And she cried.

44:31.919 --> 44:32.961
I used my hand

44:34.547 --> 44:35.547
cover her mouth.

44:45.641 --> 44:46.641
She die.

44:53.691 --> 44:56.401
General Huo save my life.

44:56.486 --> 44:59.738
He said, "War destroy family.

45:00.406 --> 45:03.033
"Only peace can save Silk Road."

45:05.411 --> 45:06.745
We are same.

45:09.040 --> 45:10.123
General!

45:16.589 --> 45:18.507
Dessamiss has returned.

46:09.517 --> 46:10.642
We will meet him.

46:10.726 --> 46:12.227
Yes, General!

46:13.563 --> 46:14.646
Lucius, no.

46:14.730 --> 46:15.730
Huo An.

46:17.275 --> 46:19.484
If you stand with us,
you will be butchered.

46:19.569 --> 46:22.988
The city we built is a dream.

46:23.072 --> 46:24.739
It only lasts 15 days.

46:27.702 --> 46:29.661
I cannot be further in your debt.

46:29.745 --> 46:33.206
Think, if Tiberius want to catch you,

46:33.291 --> 46:35.459
why he need 100,000 men?

46:35.543 --> 46:38.420
He can take over the entire Silk Road,
even China.

46:39.213 --> 46:42.174
I think Tiberius working with the Chief.

46:42.258 --> 46:44.342
It's our duty to protect Silk Road.

46:44.427 --> 46:47.137
I can borrow a soldier
from my friend Yin Po.

46:47.221 --> 46:49.055
Hopefully, we can stop them.

46:58.774 --> 47:00.108
Captain Huo?

47:04.614 --> 47:05.780
Falco?

47:05.865 --> 47:07.324
Young Master.

47:11.871 --> 47:14.331
On behalf of the Roman Empire,

47:15.374 --> 47:19.836
I commission you
for centurion of the legion.

47:59.835 --> 48:00.961
What crime have I committed?

48:01.045 --> 48:03.672
Huo An is a traitor and all his family
members are to be executed.

48:03.756 --> 48:06.466
- How can you hit little children?
- Shut up!

48:06.551 --> 48:07.968
Let me go!

48:32.034 --> 48:33.451
Don't push me!

48:43.421 --> 48:44.421
Get the kids!

48:45.214 --> 48:46.923
- Children, get out of here!
- Go!

48:47.008 --> 48:48.049
Batu, go!

48:53.180 --> 48:54.180
Go!

49:06.819 --> 49:08.945
Thank you for rescuing us.
What's your name?

49:09.030 --> 49:10.989
I am Moon, Huo An's wife.

49:14.910 --> 49:16.036
- It's not true.
- Duck!

49:16.120 --> 49:17.120
Duck!

49:21.834 --> 49:22.876
- Duck.
- Don't move!

49:27.923 --> 49:29.591
Hurry, take the kids
to the second floor.

49:29.675 --> 49:31.343
Don't be scared!
Go to the second floor!

49:31.427 --> 49:34.179
- Hurry, go to the second floor.
- Quickly!

49:59.789 --> 50:00.997
Send the kids down.

50:12.510 --> 50:13.802
Quick! Quick!

50:25.356 --> 50:27.357
- Don't be afraid.
- Book.

50:29.110 --> 50:30.568
My books.

50:30.778 --> 50:31.861
Come, quickly!

50:32.321 --> 50:33.446
Help me. Together.

50:40.329 --> 50:42.497
Hurry. Go! Hurry, go!

50:42.581 --> 50:44.582
Yes! Children, hurry, let's go!

50:55.469 --> 50:57.846
No. This way, quick.

50:58.556 --> 50:59.681
After them!

51:10.609 --> 51:11.609
Go!

51:13.446 --> 51:14.446
Hurry up!

51:23.664 --> 51:24.664
Go!

51:28.961 --> 51:30.712
- Get the kids out of here.
- I will.

51:30.796 --> 51:32.881
- Listen to your teacher.
- Yes!

51:46.479 --> 51:47.687
Sun! Thank you.

51:47.813 --> 51:48.938
I'm just here for my sister.

51:49.106 --> 51:50.106
Hurry!

51:56.155 --> 51:57.822
My books.

51:58.949 --> 52:00.158
Look out!

52:04.497 --> 52:05.538
Xiuqing!

52:16.175 --> 52:18.426
- Teacher!
- Don't be afraid, Alijiang.

52:34.235 --> 52:36.444
Teacher! Teacher!

52:36.529 --> 52:37.737
- Go!
- Go!

52:49.542 --> 52:50.959
All of you, come here.

52:51.085 --> 52:52.085
Go!

53:11.438 --> 53:12.605
Sun!

53:23.158 --> 53:24.492
Go! Go!

53:37.965 --> 53:39.340
General Lucius!

53:42.595 --> 53:44.429
General Lucius,
reinforcements are here.

53:53.439 --> 53:55.440
General Lucius.

54:17.630 --> 54:18.671
Where is Huo An?

54:18.756 --> 54:20.423
- Lucius!
- General!

54:30.559 --> 54:31.643
- Capture them alive.
- Yes!

54:31.727 --> 54:33.436
Lucius!

54:48.243 --> 54:49.243
Lucius!

54:50.037 --> 54:51.204
Lucius!

54:53.582 --> 54:56.459
Lucius, don't worry about me!

54:56.543 --> 54:59.754
Go! Leave! Go!

55:16.355 --> 55:17.647
Go!

55:17.731 --> 55:19.774
I order you to go!

55:21.318 --> 55:24.654
Go! Please go!

56:36.852 --> 56:37.977
Welcome home.

56:39.521 --> 56:41.647
So nice to have you hanging around again.

56:48.989 --> 56:50.198
Everyone in Rome,

56:51.033 --> 56:52.241
including my father,

56:53.744 --> 56:56.287
thought you were the finest warrior
in the Empire.

56:59.083 --> 57:00.416
No, no.

57:01.585 --> 57:03.628
I think of you more as a chess piece.

57:04.922 --> 57:06.172
Think about it, Lucius.

57:07.341 --> 57:09.926
If I hadn't purposely let you escape...

57:10.010 --> 57:11.302
Purposely.

57:12.596 --> 57:15.431
Do you really think you and Publius
would get this far?

57:17.059 --> 57:18.976
Who could blame me for pursuing you?

57:20.729 --> 57:21.896
I mean,

57:23.357 --> 57:27.276
thank you for the perfect excuse
to bring my troops here.

57:29.196 --> 57:33.116
I had already plotted this
with Huo's subordinate, Yin Po.

57:37.162 --> 57:40.748
Yin Po gave me
the customs clearance document

57:40.833 --> 57:42.667
and the Commander's seal.

57:44.294 --> 57:47.588
As soon as my army settles in
at the borders,

57:47.673 --> 57:50.133
the entire Silk Road region

57:51.885 --> 57:54.262
belongs to the Roman Empire.

57:55.764 --> 57:56.973
Spare the child.

57:58.809 --> 58:00.852
He's no further threat to your ambitions.

58:02.104 --> 58:03.104
Show mercy.

58:09.653 --> 58:11.112
Let me tell you.

58:12.281 --> 58:14.907
No one felt the pain

58:16.118 --> 58:17.702
more than I did

58:18.787 --> 58:20.955
when I had to blind my own brother.

58:21.874 --> 58:23.624
I beg of you.

58:23.709 --> 58:24.834
Spare him.

58:24.918 --> 58:26.294
He's committed no crime.

58:26.378 --> 58:28.045
Of course he's committed a crime!

58:29.548 --> 58:30.673
His crime...

58:31.466 --> 58:32.758
His crime...

58:34.011 --> 58:37.305
Is that he took the place in your heart
that belonged to me.

58:55.032 --> 58:57.200
You will never

58:57.284 --> 59:00.369
hurt my young master ever again!

59:01.455 --> 59:02.788
Falco will take you home.

59:04.750 --> 59:06.042
Don't be afraid.

59:06.126 --> 59:07.168
It's all right.

59:34.905 --> 59:36.614
With my brother dead,

59:38.533 --> 59:42.078
there really is no more cause
for conflict between you and I.

59:54.633 --> 59:57.009
I will tell you a secret.

59:57.094 --> 59:58.094
Lately...

01:00:01.306 --> 01:00:03.766
When I look at my reflection...

01:00:07.145 --> 01:00:08.271
I see you.

01:00:16.571 --> 01:00:17.571
Right.

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:21.659
It does get boring

01:00:23.453 --> 01:00:25.037
when everything is so predictable.

01:00:47.019 --> 01:00:48.060
Captain.

01:00:49.938 --> 01:00:51.856
We fell for Yin Po's trap.

01:00:57.738 --> 01:00:58.738
I'm sorry.

01:01:07.539 --> 01:01:08.539
Go on.

01:01:09.666 --> 01:01:10.875
Captain,

01:01:10.959 --> 01:01:12.418
something happened

01:01:12.961 --> 01:01:14.628
before you returned this morning.

01:01:15.714 --> 01:01:18.132
Our great General Tiberius

01:01:18.216 --> 01:01:20.968
has enacted a plan to unify the Silk Road.

01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:30.144
I already asked him to acquiesce.

01:01:32.147 --> 01:01:33.439
He said no.

01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:41.364
All of the 36 nations have acquiesced.

01:01:41.448 --> 01:01:43.366
You are the last.

01:01:47.704 --> 01:01:49.455
We need you to do one thing.

01:01:50.082 --> 01:01:51.707
What did they want you to do?

01:01:54.878 --> 01:01:55.961
They want us

01:01:58.131 --> 01:01:59.173
to give them Captain Huo.

01:02:00.967 --> 01:02:02.009
What did you say?

01:02:09.976 --> 01:02:11.185
Huo An,

01:02:11.269 --> 01:02:14.230
this was never our business to start
with. Why should we get involved?

01:02:14.314 --> 01:02:15.815
Captain Huo!

01:02:15.899 --> 01:02:17.441
We are not as heroic as you are.

01:02:17.526 --> 01:02:19.402
How do you expect us
to protect this place

01:02:19.486 --> 01:02:21.028
when we can't even protect ourselves?

01:02:21.113 --> 01:02:23.572
The Romans are right.
We all have families.

01:02:23.657 --> 01:02:25.699
This way we can just take the gold
and go home.

01:02:25.826 --> 01:02:27.785
Huo An, if you don't give yourself up,

01:02:27.869 --> 01:02:29.745
we'll all die because of you.

01:02:29.830 --> 01:02:31.205
We've been slaves all our lives.

01:02:31.289 --> 01:02:34.792
This time we should have the right
to make our own decision.

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:43.509
Give yourself up!

01:02:58.942 --> 01:02:59.942
Huo An,

01:03:00.527 --> 01:03:01.902
are these people

01:03:02.571 --> 01:03:04.071
worth it?

01:03:04.156 --> 01:03:05.948
We should leave.

01:03:06.032 --> 01:03:08.826
They need me now more than ever.

01:03:16.042 --> 01:03:17.793
General Huo once said,

01:03:17.878 --> 01:03:20.588
"A person who only laments the past
is a coward,

01:03:20.672 --> 01:03:23.382
whereas a person who can
change the future is a true hero."

01:03:24.009 --> 01:03:26.677
Nonetheless, I have to admit

01:03:26.761 --> 01:03:29.847
that the fate of the Silk Road can't be
changed by the Protection Squad alone.

01:03:31.892 --> 01:03:33.517
Still, I'm truly thankful.

01:03:35.437 --> 01:03:37.771
I thank you all

01:03:37.856 --> 01:03:40.232
for joining me in rebuilding this city.

01:03:40.317 --> 01:03:41.901
Together we proved

01:03:41.985 --> 01:03:43.903
that harmony between the races
can be achieved.

01:03:48.450 --> 01:03:51.243
During that precious time,
it felt as though

01:03:51.328 --> 01:03:53.787
we were giving birth
to a newborn child of hope.

01:03:55.957 --> 01:03:58.209
But his life

01:03:58.293 --> 01:03:59.752
has been cut so short

01:04:02.797 --> 01:04:05.424
that I won't have the chance
to see him grow up.

01:04:16.895 --> 01:04:18.771
My brothers on the Silk Road,

01:04:19.648 --> 01:04:21.941
I have already given my all.

01:04:24.653 --> 01:04:27.279
People are rarely satisfied
with the truth.

01:04:29.157 --> 01:04:31.909
If I can satisfy you by giving my life,

01:04:33.787 --> 01:04:35.996
I will die with no regrets.

01:04:39.084 --> 01:04:41.293
But I do have one last request.

01:04:44.464 --> 01:04:47.049
Please raise the flags
that we made together.

01:04:48.468 --> 01:04:49.677
Raise them for me,

01:04:52.305 --> 01:04:55.224
so I can take one last look
at our child.

01:04:58.853 --> 01:05:01.438
I will be forever indebted to you.

01:05:06.736 --> 01:05:11.490
I promise to repay you in my next life.

01:05:48.903 --> 01:05:50.988
Look at me, the mighty Rat,
the big hero.

01:05:52.699 --> 01:05:55.326
What am I going to do with these coins,
buy a coffin?

01:05:55.535 --> 01:05:58.746
I'll kill whoever dares
to invade Wild Geese Gate.

01:05:58.830 --> 01:05:59.997
I'll fight!

01:06:00.081 --> 01:06:02.291
To my last breath.

01:06:19.392 --> 01:06:21.018
Huo An! It's Huo An! It's Huo An!

01:06:45.543 --> 01:06:49.755
Well, I'm not sure why,
but I've always liked those who hated me.

01:06:50.965 --> 01:06:54.093
Now, Huo An, pledge your allegiance to me,

01:06:55.136 --> 01:06:56.637
and I will let you live.

01:06:57.305 --> 01:07:00.265
How can you be so blind?
Dare you to speak about truth?

01:07:01.309 --> 01:07:03.519
I am Huo An,
work so hard in the Silk Road.

01:07:04.562 --> 01:07:05.729
I am the one who should be a chief.

01:07:05.814 --> 01:07:07.147
What are you doing?
Get back here.

01:07:08.566 --> 01:07:11.110
How can you give for Yin Po
the chief position?

01:07:12.529 --> 01:07:14.530
You see,
he will hand over the border to you

01:07:15.073 --> 01:07:16.740
just so he can be a chief.

01:07:17.867 --> 01:07:21.370
So you're saying there's a problem
with Yin Po?

01:07:30.004 --> 01:07:32.631
General, Yin Po will arrive soon.

01:07:34.342 --> 01:07:36.427
How many men is he bringing with him?

01:07:36.511 --> 01:07:38.262
At least 10,000 soldiers.

01:07:38.346 --> 01:07:40.431
- And weapons?
- All fully-armed.

01:08:01.286 --> 01:08:02.911
Is something wrong?

01:08:05.582 --> 01:08:06.582
Ready.

01:08:09.127 --> 01:08:10.711
On his right, can you see the keys?

01:08:10.795 --> 01:08:12.463
Yes, I'm going to get them now.

01:08:16.091 --> 01:08:17.718
Get in there. Get in!

01:08:17.801 --> 01:08:20.595
I'll let you know when it's unlocked.
Don't worry, I'll help them.

01:08:23.850 --> 01:08:26.727
Gold, give us. Go home.

01:08:29.063 --> 01:08:30.564
How can you not live up to your word?

01:08:30.689 --> 01:08:31.689
Move!

01:08:35.528 --> 01:08:36.528
I got the key.

01:08:36.613 --> 01:08:38.613
You also got caught.
How will you help the others?

01:08:43.536 --> 01:08:44.787
General Tiberius.

01:08:45.662 --> 01:08:46.955
Yin Po.

01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:50.000
I have completed
all of your instructions.

01:08:50.084 --> 01:08:54.296
As long as you give me
the Prefecture Chief's seal,

01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:58.258
in exchange, I will surrender
the Commander's Seal.

01:09:00.678 --> 01:09:01.929
What all do you know of Huo An?

01:09:06.142 --> 01:09:07.309
Understand?

01:09:07.393 --> 01:09:08.602
Everyone understand?

01:09:11.898 --> 01:09:12.898
Now.

01:09:24.702 --> 01:09:26.370
- Hey!
- Don't!

01:09:26.453 --> 01:09:27.496
Go!

01:09:45.515 --> 01:09:47.975
Hey, Huo An, give us the key!

01:09:52.438 --> 01:09:53.438
Here!

01:09:56.276 --> 01:09:57.693
They're coming! Faster!

01:10:01.197 --> 01:10:02.906
Take care of yourself!

01:10:07.537 --> 01:10:09.413
Now! Kill them all!

01:10:19.090 --> 01:10:20.090
Shoot.

01:10:25.138 --> 01:10:26.221
Who shot that arrow?

01:10:26.306 --> 01:10:28.098
Ready, armed!

01:10:29.851 --> 01:10:30.684
Yes, General.

01:10:30.768 --> 01:10:32.019
Sound the attack!

01:10:40.486 --> 01:10:41.486
Kill them!

01:10:45.325 --> 01:10:47.451
We have no reason to initiate this fight.

01:10:48.202 --> 01:10:49.453
Kill him,

01:10:49.537 --> 01:10:52.205
and the Prefecture Chief title
belongs to you.

01:10:54.959 --> 01:10:55.959
Ma Chuang.

01:11:12.435 --> 01:11:13.435
Good throw.

01:12:18.835 --> 01:12:20.293
General, the jail has been breached.

01:12:21.963 --> 01:12:22.963
Huo An.

01:12:25.925 --> 01:12:27.592
Well, send more people there.

01:12:50.783 --> 01:12:52.325
Open the gate!

01:13:03.254 --> 01:13:05.422
Huo An, is that you?

01:13:05.506 --> 01:13:06.506
Yes.

01:13:10.636 --> 01:13:11.636
Huo An.

01:13:16.893 --> 01:13:17.893
Huo An.

01:13:19.395 --> 01:13:20.687
It's you.

01:13:33.076 --> 01:13:35.368
You have no business
in Roman family quarrels.

01:13:37.622 --> 01:13:38.997
This is not your business.

01:13:41.292 --> 01:13:42.334
It's my duty.

01:13:44.170 --> 01:13:45.712
Listen to me.

01:13:45.797 --> 01:13:47.047
Huo An!

01:13:49.926 --> 01:13:51.218
Listen to me. Listen.

01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:55.305
The city we built,

01:13:56.641 --> 01:14:01.728
a city without fear, terror, humiliation.

01:14:06.692 --> 01:14:09.653
When they raze that city,

01:14:11.447 --> 01:14:12.447
rebuild it.

01:14:13.533 --> 01:14:15.534
Whoever shares that city with me

01:14:16.869 --> 01:14:17.869
is forever my friend.

01:14:46.524 --> 01:14:47.691
Huo An.

01:14:48.651 --> 01:14:49.651
Huo An.

01:14:53.906 --> 01:14:55.407
First Centurion,

01:14:56.909 --> 01:15:00.036
I entrust my troops to you.

01:15:00.913 --> 01:15:03.373
Go, or they will die here with you.

01:15:07.587 --> 01:15:10.297
Go! Now!

01:15:20.141 --> 01:15:21.391
Huo An.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.417
Take me home.

01:16:05.728 --> 01:16:07.229
We shall meet again.

01:16:37.301 --> 01:16:38.468
Here they come!

01:16:38.552 --> 01:16:39.552
Get ready!

01:16:51.357 --> 01:16:52.649
Archers!

01:17:10.209 --> 01:17:11.793
- Get back!
- Pull back!

01:17:12.461 --> 01:17:14.546
- Come on!
- Pull it back! Pull it back!

01:17:15.881 --> 01:17:17.590
Get back! Come on! Come on!

01:17:22.138 --> 01:17:22.971
Stone!

01:17:23.055 --> 01:17:24.180
Stones!

01:17:24.598 --> 01:17:26.599
Drop the stones!

01:17:39.113 --> 01:17:40.113
Hurry!

01:17:40.698 --> 01:17:41.698
Forward!

01:18:06.599 --> 01:18:07.599
Go!

01:18:23.032 --> 01:18:24.032
Go!

01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:33.875
- Go!
- Go!

01:18:33.959 --> 01:18:35.293
Get out of here!

01:18:35.378 --> 01:18:37.379
Soldiers, let's leave!

01:18:37.463 --> 01:18:38.838
Hurry, move.

01:18:43.386 --> 01:18:45.428
They're coming! Positions!

01:18:50.309 --> 01:18:53.269
To the right! Hold the line!

01:18:57.274 --> 01:18:58.775
Company hold!

01:18:59.318 --> 01:19:01.486
Statius, we are all Romans.

01:19:01.987 --> 01:19:03.029
Surrender!

01:19:05.074 --> 01:19:08.034
A true Roman never surrenders!

01:19:09.829 --> 01:19:10.829
To arms!

01:19:13.082 --> 01:19:15.125
Form ranks!

01:19:15.209 --> 01:19:18.503
Form ranks! Form ranks!

01:19:26.637 --> 01:19:28.513
- Use the shield. Slide the rock.
- Yes, sir!

01:19:36.939 --> 01:19:37.939
Push!

01:19:53.414 --> 01:19:55.748
Follow me! Quick!

01:19:55.833 --> 01:19:57.083
Go! Go! Go!

01:20:07.219 --> 01:20:08.511
Take the hill!

01:20:08.596 --> 01:20:09.971
The hill!

01:20:10.055 --> 01:20:12.474
General, Huo An.

01:20:21.358 --> 01:20:22.817
My god, they're like locusts!

01:20:23.360 --> 01:20:24.819
We're trapped!

01:20:26.947 --> 01:20:29.240
No, brother, we die together!

01:20:29.325 --> 01:20:30.325
Die together!

01:21:52.366 --> 01:21:53.366
Engage!

01:22:01.667 --> 01:22:03.543
Brothers, charge!

01:22:08.716 --> 01:22:09.716
Attack!

01:22:51.050 --> 01:22:52.675
Moon, go rescue Huo An!

01:22:55.512 --> 01:22:57.138
Awake!

01:23:02.936 --> 01:23:04.479
Awake!

01:23:14.698 --> 01:23:15.782
Go!

01:23:47.523 --> 01:23:48.773
Kill them!

01:24:03.455 --> 01:24:04.747
Fight them!

01:24:21.432 --> 01:24:23.474
About face!

01:24:34.027 --> 01:24:35.069
Move down!

01:24:35.154 --> 01:24:36.195
Move down!

01:24:43.370 --> 01:24:45.163
Engage!

01:25:34.129 --> 01:25:35.129
Captain!

01:25:47.226 --> 01:25:48.226
Captain!

01:26:46.785 --> 01:26:47.785
Sun.

01:27:04.219 --> 01:27:05.303
Parthians.

01:27:12.477 --> 01:27:14.478
Disengage the army.

01:27:52.851 --> 01:27:53.851
Tiberius,

01:27:54.895 --> 01:27:58.356
the criminal who killed Crassus
and blinded Publius,

01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:00.191
stands here before you.

01:28:05.155 --> 01:28:07.114
This is an outrage!

01:28:08.075 --> 01:28:09.909
Look, I just wanna say...

01:28:13.538 --> 01:28:16.916
Consul Crassus and I
signed this peace treaty

01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.835
so as to guarantee
the safety of your brother.

01:28:21.213 --> 01:28:24.340
Because your father knew
of your evil plan.

01:28:26.134 --> 01:28:30.012
So let me ask you
on behalf of your father and brother,

01:28:30.097 --> 01:28:31.514
what was on your mind

01:28:32.933 --> 01:28:34.934
when you ended their lives?

01:28:50.659 --> 01:28:53.119
It's never too late to turn back.

01:28:55.664 --> 01:28:56.872
Give me your sword.

01:29:18.186 --> 01:29:23.482
A real hero remains accountable
until the end.

01:29:31.950 --> 01:29:32.950
Right.

01:29:34.745 --> 01:29:35.786
I did it.

01:29:38.373 --> 01:29:40.124
Let's resolve this.

01:30:06.401 --> 01:30:08.861
If I made a mistake in this game of chess,

01:30:09.988 --> 01:30:11.906
it'd be that I looked down upon you.

01:30:13.742 --> 01:30:14.742
No.

01:30:15.952 --> 01:30:17.536
You looked down on human.

01:30:20.290 --> 01:30:22.249
Why are you so eager to end your story?

01:30:23.001 --> 01:30:25.252
Not for me. For my friend.

01:30:27.214 --> 01:30:28.214
Lucius.

01:30:32.010 --> 01:30:34.011
What a good friend you are!

01:30:35.806 --> 01:30:38.265
But this is a Roman murder.

01:30:38.350 --> 01:30:40.810
You have no right
to challenge me to a duel.

01:30:41.436 --> 01:30:45.564
Master Publius made Huo An
as a Roman warrior!

01:30:45.649 --> 01:30:48.400
General Lucius placed us
under his command!

01:30:48.485 --> 01:30:50.319
He's one of us now!

01:30:57.369 --> 01:30:58.702
Let's resolve this.

01:31:00.205 --> 01:31:01.205
You and I.

01:31:02.499 --> 01:31:03.666
Well, then,

01:31:05.210 --> 01:31:06.919
we shall give you a proper burial.

01:32:12.194 --> 01:32:13.402
Huo An!

01:33:25.475 --> 01:33:28.143
You're wearing the headband of a dead man.

01:33:35.986 --> 01:33:37.903
I'd say that's a bad omen.

01:34:13.773 --> 01:34:17.026
God will bless us all.

01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:19.695
Huo An!

01:34:19.779 --> 01:34:21.905
Huo An!

01:34:34.919 --> 01:34:36.503
The show is over!

01:34:49.184 --> 01:34:51.018
Don't worry.

01:34:51.102 --> 01:34:52.561
You'll be with him soon enough.

01:34:59.319 --> 01:35:00.319
Huo An!

01:35:38.483 --> 01:35:40.067
Power is a conceit

01:35:41.111 --> 01:35:43.570
which reveals our limitations.

01:35:53.123 --> 01:35:54.873
A real hero

01:35:56.418 --> 01:35:58.085
remains accountable

01:35:59.045 --> 01:36:00.254
till the end.

01:36:59.606 --> 01:37:05.027
Land of my forefathers

01:37:05.111 --> 01:37:10.240
Forever brimming with glory

01:37:10.325 --> 01:37:15.245
A land of beauty

01:37:15.330 --> 01:37:20.375
Home of the courageous

01:37:20.460 --> 01:37:26.507
Our eternal Rome

01:37:27.759 --> 01:37:33.055
The might of enemy ships

01:37:33.139 --> 01:37:38.060
Threatens us in vain

01:37:38.144 --> 01:37:38.227
It is a hopeless quest

01:37:38.228 --> 01:37:38.310
It is a hopeless quest

01:37:38.311 --> 01:37:45.108
It is a hopeless quest

01:38:12.512 --> 01:38:14.930
Soldiers, salute!

01:38:17.141 --> 01:38:21.061
TURN FOES INTO FRIENDS

01:38:27.777 --> 01:38:32.573
For the trumpets of war

01:38:32.657 --> 01:38:36.660
Will call our legions soon

01:38:37.704 --> 01:38:42.791
And across the fatherland

01:38:42.875 --> 01:38:49.423
A victory song will ring

01:38:50.550 --> 01:38:55.429
And across the fatherland

01:38:55.513 --> 01:39:00.517
Our song will resonate

01:39:00.602 --> 01:39:05.188
A time of joy and pride

01:39:05.648 --> 01:39:12.613
For eternal Rome

01:39:34.218 --> 01:39:36.261
You make a friend today.
You lose one tomorrow.

01:39:38.765 --> 01:39:40.057
Is it worth it?

01:39:41.305 --> 01:39:47.268
