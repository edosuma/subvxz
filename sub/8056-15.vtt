00:02.918 --> 00:04.452
- Oh, God.
- Hey, Boo-boo bear.

00:04.718 --> 00:06.052
What did you
just call me?

00:06.086 --> 00:07.503
- Boo-boo bear.
- Oh.

00:07.537 --> 00:09.672
It's one of several nicknames
I made up for you,

00:09.706 --> 00:11.674
and you can choose which one
you like best,

00:11.708 --> 00:13.426
'cause I want this
to be a give and take.

00:13.477 --> 00:16.512
Okay, we went out once,
and nothing happened.

00:16.546 --> 00:18.347
There is no "this."

00:18.382 --> 00:19.732
We have "cookie tush"...

00:19.766 --> 00:21.317
Wow, just
right out the gate.

00:21.351 --> 00:23.352
"Winnie the boo,"
"Lady presh-presh,"

00:23.387 --> 00:25.955
"Ann-Berry sauce,"
"Annie get your boo,"

00:25.989 --> 00:28.357
"Tommy's girl,"
"Annie banannie--"

00:28.391 --> 00:30.109
Hey!

00:30.160 --> 00:32.411
All right,
let's do this.

00:34.765 --> 00:37.116
What are you doing?

00:37.167 --> 00:39.769
Is this not
one of those?

00:39.803 --> 00:41.070
I might have misread the vibe.

00:41.088 --> 00:44.307
Oh, my God, dude, you have
to be cooler about this.

00:44.341 --> 00:46.742
Look, I told Leslie
because she's my best friend,

00:46.760 --> 00:49.295
but if anybody finds out
about this

00:49.346 --> 00:50.513
and they start jabbering,

00:50.547 --> 00:52.748
it's gonna make it
really hard to know

00:52.766 --> 00:54.784
if this is
actually anything,

00:54.818 --> 00:58.454
so just keep it
on the DL, okay?

00:58.488 --> 01:00.640
I feel like
you're embarrassed by me.

01:00.691 --> 01:01.757
That is accurate.

01:02.275 --> 01:03.609
Can I at least change
my Facebook status

01:03.644 --> 01:04.760
to "In a relationship"?

01:04.778 --> 01:06.228
Definitely not.

01:06.262 --> 01:07.229
"It's complicated"?

01:08.263 --> 01:09.114
Whatever.

01:09.115 --> 01:11.133
Am I in a relationship?

01:13.236 --> 01:14.837
It's complicated.

01:36.343 --> 01:37.927
Chief Trumple,
nice to see you.

01:37.961 --> 01:39.662
- Hi,
- Hey, Knope. Wyatt.

01:39.696 --> 01:42.398
Been a long time, eh, cap'n?
Or Captain.

01:42.432 --> 01:43.733
"Oh, Captain,
my Captain!"

01:43.767 --> 01:45.668
From <i>Dead Poets' Society.</i>

01:45.702 --> 01:47.737
- You getting weird already?
- Nope, I'm good.

01:47.771 --> 01:49.572
Pawnee's police chief
is retiring,

01:49.606 --> 01:51.941
and I'm trying to get
his endorsement before he goes.

01:51.975 --> 01:55.478
I'm really nervous because
I need this for my campaign.

01:55.512 --> 01:58.447
And Ben is really nervous
because he is afraid of cops.

01:58.482 --> 02:00.883
I'm not afraid of cops.
I have no reason to be.

02:00.917 --> 02:02.918
I never break any laws, ever...

02:02.953 --> 02:06.188
Because I'm deathly afraid
of cops.

02:06.223 --> 02:08.207
Look, Knope,
I've always liked you.

02:08.258 --> 02:10.059
But the Newports
run this town.

02:10.092 --> 02:11.210
And frankly,
they've donated

02:11.261 --> 02:12.795
a lot of money
to the department.

02:12.829 --> 02:15.164
Mo' money, mo' problems,
that's what I always say.

02:15.198 --> 02:17.800
How about "mo' money,
more protective kevlar vests"

02:17.834 --> 02:19.402
- that save lives"?
- I-I...

02:19.436 --> 02:20.669
Sometimes
I say that, too.

02:20.687 --> 02:22.171
I understand
you need to think about it,

02:22.205 --> 02:24.339
but if you were going to make
a decision--

02:24.357 --> 02:26.208
The guys are throwing me
a little retirement thing

02:26.243 --> 02:27.410
tonight at O'Flynnigans.

02:27.444 --> 02:29.111
There's gonna be beer.

02:29.146 --> 02:31.380
So why don't you swing by?
I'll give you an answer.

02:31.415 --> 02:32.698
Weirdo can come, too.

02:32.733 --> 02:34.450
- All right.
- Let's go.

02:34.484 --> 02:36.285
- Oh, hey, uh, may I say...
- Don't.

02:36.319 --> 02:38.070
- That the boys in blue...
- Stop.

02:38.121 --> 02:39.121
are heroes?

02:39.156 --> 02:41.023
Obviously some
more than others.

02:41.041 --> 02:44.359
Oh, boy,
here it comes.

02:44.377 --> 02:45.411
9/11.

02:45.462 --> 02:47.046
- And we're walking.
- Okay.

02:47.080 --> 02:49.749
Listen up, people.
This is very serious.

02:49.800 --> 02:52.334
Jerry, if you're eating,
you're not listening.

02:52.368 --> 02:54.553
Thanks, babe. I don't know
how many of you have heard,

02:54.588 --> 02:56.906
but there's a flesh-eating virus
going around.

02:56.940 --> 02:57.973
Yeah.

02:58.008 --> 02:59.341
It's called "music,"

02:59.375 --> 03:02.011
and there's only one way
to get a vaccine,

03:02.045 --> 03:04.730
and that is to play it.

03:04.765 --> 03:07.850
To play the--
you get an injection--

03:07.884 --> 03:09.251
Just say
your piece, son.

03:09.286 --> 03:12.488
I have finished writing
Leslie's campaign anthem.

03:12.522 --> 03:15.424
It's called <i>Catch Your Dream,</i>
and it's amazing.

03:15.459 --> 03:17.393
It's kind of like
<i>We Are The World,</i>

03:17.427 --> 03:19.161
except I actually think
it could have

03:19.196 --> 03:20.629
a real impact on society.

03:20.664 --> 03:23.399
Here's the thing--we need
backup singers, and I thought,

03:23.433 --> 03:26.168
"who better to be backup singers
than Leslie's campaign team?"

03:26.203 --> 03:28.070
Everyone's got something
they're in charge of

03:28.105 --> 03:29.171
for Leslie's campaign.

03:29.206 --> 03:31.273
My job is the song.

03:31.308 --> 03:32.975
She originally put me
in charge of hot dogs

03:33.009 --> 03:34.910
at this fund-raising barbecue,
and I dropped them all--

03:34.945 --> 03:36.712
all of them,
like a thousand,

03:36.746 --> 03:38.981
so I really want to do
a good job.

03:39.015 --> 03:40.749
So we're gonna
record this bitch tonight,

03:40.784 --> 03:43.135
6:00,
Doubletime Studio.

03:43.186 --> 03:44.420
Doubletime,
you said?

03:44.454 --> 03:46.472
Little brick building
over on Liondale Road?

03:46.523 --> 03:47.807
Yeah,
you know the one?

03:47.858 --> 03:49.591
No.

03:49.609 --> 03:51.593
You could not keep it together
in there.

03:51.611 --> 03:53.028
I know. I'm sorry.

03:53.063 --> 03:54.814
But I'm fine now,

03:54.865 --> 03:57.116
as long as we get out of here
as quickly as possible

03:57.150 --> 03:58.117
and never come back.

03:58.151 --> 03:59.118
Hey, Leslie!

03:59.152 --> 04:01.003
Oh!

04:01.037 --> 04:02.288
- Dave.
- Hey.

04:02.322 --> 04:05.608
- Oh, my God. Wow.
- Hey.

04:05.642 --> 04:06.742
You look great.

04:06.776 --> 04:09.628
San Diego sun...
Got me all tanned up.

04:09.663 --> 04:12.498
So what are you--
oh, sorry.

04:12.549 --> 04:13.883
Um, Ben, this, uh--

04:13.917 --> 04:15.968
this is my--
this is Dave Sanderson.

04:17.620 --> 04:19.505
- Oh, hey.
- Nice to meet you.

04:19.555 --> 04:22.975
Uh, yes, uh, Leslie Knope
is a female person

04:23.009 --> 04:25.344
with whom I was involved.

04:25.395 --> 04:29.198
We had a romantic--
"romantical" involvement

04:29.232 --> 04:31.567
until I relocated
to San Diego,

04:31.601 --> 04:34.486
which is--
that's in California,

04:34.521 --> 04:37.156
which is southwest of here
by a number of miles.

04:37.190 --> 04:42.144
So we terminated our involvement
at that time.

04:42.179 --> 04:43.662
Are you here
for a while?

04:43.697 --> 04:44.713
No, just tonight,

04:44.748 --> 04:46.415
for the chief's
retirement thing.

04:46.449 --> 04:48.984
Oh, yeah, we're going
to that, too, actually,

04:49.002 --> 04:50.286
but we're gonna go
a little later,

04:50.320 --> 04:51.420
'cause first,
we're going to have dinner

04:51.454 --> 04:53.322
at a really nice
new French restaurant.

04:53.356 --> 04:56.491
Cool. I'm gonna go
to the gas station

04:56.509 --> 04:57.993
and get
a frozen burrito

04:58.011 --> 05:01.730
and eat it right there
at that table.

05:02.666 --> 05:04.600
Well, see you later.

05:04.634 --> 05:06.218
You should come
to dinner with us.

05:06.269 --> 05:07.469
Okay.

05:07.503 --> 05:09.355
I shouldn't have invited him.
I'm sorry.

05:09.389 --> 05:10.773
Oh, no, no--

05:10.807 --> 05:12.558
No, that's okay.

05:12.609 --> 05:14.843
I mean, I just feel like
it's kind of odd

05:14.878 --> 05:17.112
for me and him
to hang out with you.

05:17.147 --> 05:19.481
Honestly, if you want to just
go out with him alone,

05:19.515 --> 05:20.583
I'd be totally
okay with it.

05:20.617 --> 05:22.351
No, look,
he's here for one night.

05:22.369 --> 05:24.386
He's a really great guy,
and he's gonna love you,

05:24.421 --> 05:28.040
which--bonus--will make
all the other cops love you.

05:28.074 --> 05:30.993
Dave is a great person, and
he's a great judge of character.

05:31.027 --> 05:32.828
Tonight he's going
to endorse Ben,

05:32.862 --> 05:35.197
and Trumple is going
to endorse me.

05:35.232 --> 05:36.665
Double endorsement.

05:36.699 --> 05:39.084
Ooh, that sounds like
an Ashley Judd movie.

05:39.135 --> 05:41.503
Studio's down here.
Let's go.

05:41.537 --> 05:45.341
Hustle, people,
come on. Jerry...

05:45.375 --> 05:47.393
Ah.

05:49.712 --> 05:50.913
That's vandalism.

05:50.947 --> 05:52.514
I have a problem.

05:52.548 --> 05:55.651
This happens to be the studio
where a local saxophone legend

05:55.685 --> 05:57.720
named Duke Silver
records his albums.

05:57.754 --> 05:59.021
I've heard of him.

05:59.055 --> 06:02.024
I heard he makes mature women
swoon when he plays.

06:02.058 --> 06:03.492
From what I've heard
about Duke,

06:03.526 --> 06:04.994
he's kind of
a private guy.

06:05.028 --> 06:06.745
He doesn't want
his nosy coworkers

06:06.780 --> 06:10.466
discussing his music with him
or knowing that he exists.

06:10.500 --> 06:13.402
So, if you happen to see
any memorabilia laying around,

06:13.436 --> 06:15.437
kindly and discreetly
discard it.

06:15.472 --> 06:17.640
- You got it, Duke.
- Don't call me that.

06:17.674 --> 06:18.941
I dig
your groovy tunes, man.

06:18.975 --> 06:20.125
Did you hear me?

06:20.176 --> 06:22.294
I said, "I dig
your groovy tunes, man."

06:22.345 --> 06:23.796
Yo, Chuck,
we're going to go ahead

06:23.847 --> 06:25.764
and play and sing
at the same time.

06:25.799 --> 06:28.250
I want this to have the
electricity of a live concert.

06:28.268 --> 06:30.919
So we have to play it
perfectly every time?

06:32.222 --> 06:33.973
No, Burly,
play it "unperfectly."

06:34.024 --> 06:35.491
You mean imperfectly?

06:35.525 --> 06:36.525
I mean perfectly.

06:36.559 --> 06:39.311
- God, that was hot nonsense.
- Yeah.

06:39.362 --> 06:41.030
Hey, uh, can I have
a sip of that water?

06:41.064 --> 06:42.614
- Oh, sure.
- Thanks.

06:42.649 --> 06:43.866
That's sweet.

06:43.900 --> 06:47.169
The two of you
sharing a nice bottle of--

06:47.203 --> 06:50.272
- You told them.
- What?

06:50.307 --> 06:52.274
I asked you
for one thing.

06:52.309 --> 06:53.909
Fine. I told them
we went on a date.

06:53.943 --> 06:56.445
- When?
- As soon as I possibly could.

06:56.463 --> 06:58.163
I texted them
while we were on the date.

06:58.214 --> 06:59.782
I'm sorry.

06:59.816 --> 07:01.317
But you are too hot
to hide, Ann.

07:01.351 --> 07:03.819
This is on you.

07:03.853 --> 07:05.754
Hey.

07:05.789 --> 07:09.341
When you two spoon,
who spoons who?

07:10.092 --> 07:12.126
Ben's doing an amazing job
as campaign manager.

07:12.127 --> 07:13.062
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

07:13.096 --> 07:14.980
He's really smart.
You know, a campaign manager

07:15.015 --> 07:17.433
is only as good
as the campaign person

07:17.467 --> 07:18.901
that he is managing.

07:18.935 --> 07:21.170
So I'm trying to say
you're a real smart lady.

07:21.204 --> 07:22.354
Uh, you can say that again.

07:22.405 --> 07:23.638
If anything,
I'm holding her back.

07:23.656 --> 07:25.441
Aw, Ben.

07:25.475 --> 07:26.975
I said my thing first.

07:27.010 --> 07:29.078
Actually, that's why we were
at the police station today.

07:29.112 --> 07:30.746
We're trying to get
Chief Trumple's endorsement.

07:30.780 --> 07:32.164
Oh, yeah?
Hugh's a buddy of mine.

07:32.198 --> 07:33.515
I could probably
get him to endorse you.

07:33.550 --> 07:34.817
Oh, man,
that would be amazing.

07:34.851 --> 07:35.984
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

07:36.019 --> 07:38.337
Excuse me.
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

07:38.371 --> 07:39.988
Uh, you mean
"the whiz palace."

07:40.006 --> 07:41.990
Leslie calls it that
sometimes.

07:42.008 --> 07:44.326
I know.
It's kind of cute, right?

07:44.361 --> 07:45.961
Yeah, that's real cute.

07:49.265 --> 07:51.667
- So, how is San D--
- I'm still in love with you.

07:51.701 --> 07:53.535
- What did you just say?
- Nothing.

07:53.570 --> 07:56.338
I did--nuttin' was said.
Nuttin' was just now--

07:56.373 --> 07:58.207
Did you just say you were
still in love with me?

07:58.241 --> 07:59.525
No, I don't think
I said that.

07:59.559 --> 08:01.944
Dave, why would you
tell me that here and now?

08:01.978 --> 08:03.946
Because
it's accurate.

08:03.980 --> 08:06.065
And because
he's not here right now,

08:06.116 --> 08:07.583
so I thought
this would be a good time.

08:07.617 --> 08:09.551
Can I just please talk to you
about this for five minutes?

08:09.586 --> 08:11.553
No, you cannot bring
this up at all

08:11.588 --> 08:12.988
when my boyfriend is here.

08:13.022 --> 08:14.690
Okay, we'll get rid of him.
That's a good call.

08:14.724 --> 08:16.325
No, bad call.
That's not the call.

08:16.359 --> 08:18.060
Okay, if we leave now
while he's in the whiz palace...

08:18.094 --> 08:19.378
No, listen to me.
Listen--

08:19.412 --> 08:20.629
Hey.

08:20.663 --> 08:23.999
Whizzingham manor.

08:24.033 --> 08:27.553
It's another funny name
for the bathroom...

08:27.587 --> 08:29.304
That I thought of.

08:30.045 --> 08:32.312
♪ Catch your dream ♪

08:33.964 --> 08:36.448
♪ and shackle it
to your heart. ♪

08:37.918 --> 08:40.620
- ♪ Catch your--
- No, no, no, no, no.

08:40.654 --> 08:41.888
Was that a joke?

08:41.922 --> 08:43.589
Were you joking just now?
Because if so,

08:43.624 --> 08:49.295
that was hilarious...ly
awful...ly funny

08:49.313 --> 08:50.363
how bad that was.

08:50.397 --> 08:52.498
Why don't you take
15 minutes

08:52.533 --> 08:54.267
and really think
about whether or not

08:54.301 --> 08:56.185
you want to be
part of this?

08:56.236 --> 08:58.104
He's a gorgeous genius,
people.

08:58.138 --> 08:59.689
Don't question his methods.

08:59.740 --> 09:03.476
Tom, am I to understand
correctly that you are now

09:03.494 --> 09:06.312
romantically involved
with Ann Perkins?

09:06.330 --> 09:09.148
Tsk. Oh, are you
about to give me the whole

09:09.166 --> 09:11.317
"she's a great girl, I need
to treat her right" speech,

09:11.351 --> 09:14.087
- since you guys used to date?
- No.

09:14.121 --> 09:17.707
But she is,
and you should.

09:17.758 --> 09:22.061
I just had no idea,
and so now I have to...

09:22.096 --> 09:25.565
Adjust.

09:25.599 --> 09:28.634
Tsk.
Okay, great talk.

09:28.668 --> 09:30.736
Uh, how's work
out there, Dave?

09:30.771 --> 09:31.971
Pretty good.

09:32.005 --> 09:35.942
Caught a lot of bad guys,
about six bad guys.

09:35.976 --> 09:37.276
So you're leaving tomorrow?

09:37.311 --> 09:39.011
I'm scheduled
to leave tomorrow

09:39.029 --> 09:41.781
on the 12:15 flight
through Salt Lake City.

09:41.815 --> 09:43.883
Oh, it was so good
to see you.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.385
- But I may be coming back.
- How's that, now?

09:46.420 --> 09:49.288
Well, I'm mainly here
to interview for Trumple's job--

09:49.323 --> 09:51.290
- Police chief.
- Dude, that's amazing.

09:51.325 --> 09:54.243
You should totally be chief.
You could endorse Leslie.

09:54.294 --> 09:55.962
I would definitely
endorse Leslie.

09:55.996 --> 09:57.063
You don't have to.

09:57.097 --> 09:59.415
There's a lot
of good candidates.

09:59.466 --> 10:03.436
I think I'm gonna take
a little--go outside.

10:03.470 --> 10:05.571
You look like
I could use some company.

10:05.606 --> 10:07.089
- What?
- What?

10:07.141 --> 10:09.075
Would you like to step outside
with me and catch up?

10:09.109 --> 10:10.426
We have caught up.

10:10.477 --> 10:13.262
We talked about San Diego
and about the six bad guys.

10:13.313 --> 10:14.313
I think we're good.

10:14.348 --> 10:15.548
I could take
a little jaunt with you.

10:15.566 --> 10:17.567
No,
I don't want that.

10:17.601 --> 10:20.086
Well, I'm already--
I already said I'm gonna go,

10:20.120 --> 10:21.354
so I guess--I'm a man
of my word.

10:21.388 --> 10:22.438
I'm gonna go.

10:22.489 --> 10:24.624
- Take your time.
- Okay, thank you.

10:24.658 --> 10:27.426
Okay, honestly,
how do you think I'm doing?

10:27.461 --> 10:29.095
'Cause I feel like
we're getting along pretty well.

10:29.129 --> 10:30.396
He said
he's still in love with me.

10:30.430 --> 10:31.764
What's that?

10:31.798 --> 10:33.065
While you were
in the bathroom,

10:33.100 --> 10:34.900
he said he was still
in love with me.

10:34.918 --> 10:37.937
Oh, my God.
Leslie, he's a cop.

10:37.971 --> 10:40.673
He's in love with you,
and he has a gun?

10:40.707 --> 10:42.425
- Can you just not freak out?
- I'm not freaking out!

10:42.459 --> 10:43.609
- Okay.
- I'm not freaking--

10:43.644 --> 10:44.927
Uh...

10:44.962 --> 10:47.246
I know, that's--I know.

10:47.264 --> 10:50.616
Uh, it was raining out,
so I didn't want to get wet.

10:52.436 --> 10:55.288
I got some hot tea
with honey--

10:55.322 --> 10:56.389
good for the voice.

10:56.423 --> 10:57.923
I recommend you all try it.

10:57.941 --> 11:01.093
Mine's really just a cup
of honey, 'cause tea is gross.

11:01.111 --> 11:03.362
Now, here's the thing--
we're gonna start from scratch.

11:03.397 --> 11:05.481
We're gonna get rid
of this whole sucky vibe.

11:05.532 --> 11:06.932
I'm thinking we could--

11:06.950 --> 11:10.570
Whoo! To the man!

11:10.604 --> 11:13.439
I was thinking, like,
a crazy rock star vibe!

11:13.457 --> 11:15.875
See where her head's at?

11:15.909 --> 11:18.160
Follow her lead.
That was amazing.

11:18.212 --> 11:20.779
Next thing, I want to hear
how all of us sing on our own,

11:20.797 --> 11:22.832
so we can figure out
where we're going wrong.

11:22.883 --> 11:25.751
This is not an audition,
so relax.

11:25.785 --> 11:27.453
But if you don't sing good,
you're out of here.

11:27.471 --> 11:29.789
I think you sound like an angel,

11:29.823 --> 11:31.557
and everyone else
sounds like demons.

11:31.592 --> 11:33.226
I think
you shouldn't whisper.

11:33.260 --> 11:34.927
Yeah, Ann's mad at me now,

11:34.962 --> 11:37.663
but I have a few tricks
up my sleeve.

11:37.698 --> 11:40.566
I don't want to brag,
but I have a ton of experience

11:40.601 --> 11:42.101
with women being mad at me.

11:42.135 --> 11:44.403
Chris, you're first.
Sing anything you want.

- Yeah.

12:12.799 --> 12:14.700
You like dessert.
Why don't you get a dessert?

12:14.735 --> 12:16.969
Oh, dessert's overrated
and gross.

12:17.003 --> 12:19.805
Dave, thank you so much
for a lovely evening.

12:19.839 --> 12:21.057
Oh, actually,

12:21.108 --> 12:23.976
Ben, would you mind
if I talked to Leslie alone?

12:24.010 --> 12:26.846
Uh, actually, Dave,
I'd like to talk to you.

12:26.880 --> 12:29.148
I don't want to talk to you.
I want to talk to Leslie.

12:29.182 --> 12:31.284
Well, I want to talk to you,
and if not,

12:31.318 --> 12:32.568
then I'd like to talk
to Leslie.

12:32.619 --> 12:33.903
Well, I'd like to talk
to Ben,

12:33.954 --> 12:36.355
and then I'd like the three
of us to talk together.

12:36.390 --> 12:38.124
Well, then I'll talk to Ben,

12:38.158 --> 12:40.493
and then you--
and then I'll talk to you,

12:40.527 --> 12:41.994
and then you'll talk
to each other,

12:42.028 --> 12:43.579
and then we'll
all three talk, then.

12:43.630 --> 12:47.233
- All right.

Oh, for [Bleep] sake.

12:59.479 --> 13:01.047
Ann, I caught feelings
for you,

13:01.081 --> 13:02.381
and I want you
to be my girl,

13:02.416 --> 13:04.183
And I don't care who knows.

13:04.217 --> 13:06.552
I know you don't care, dummy.
I care.

13:06.570 --> 13:08.421
Let's not get hung up
on who wants what.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.456
You know what?
I'm calling this. We're done.

13:10.490 --> 13:12.391
What about our next date?

13:12.426 --> 13:14.060
If you want another date,
keep walking away.

13:15.094 --> 13:16.329
She's still walking.

13:16.363 --> 13:18.748
I need you to know something,
man-to-man.

13:18.782 --> 13:20.866
I still have feelings
for Leslie,

13:20.900 --> 13:22.601
in a womanly fashion,

13:22.636 --> 13:26.572
and I believe she feels
the same towards me,

13:26.590 --> 13:29.041
in a manly way.

13:29.076 --> 13:32.278
She doesn't feel the same way,
because she has a boyfriend--

13:32.312 --> 13:36.015
um, me, and--and--
and--and we love each other.

13:36.049 --> 13:38.801
That's--that information is--
it's not pertinent...

13:38.852 --> 13:40.353
- Well, I--
- Frankly, at this juncture.

13:40.387 --> 13:44.156
I just said to you one thing,
and you're "contraring" me.

13:44.191 --> 13:45.691
I don't think
that's a word.

13:45.726 --> 13:49.928
I think we'd all appreciate it
if you would just let me have

13:49.946 --> 13:51.397
three minutes with her alone.

13:51.431 --> 13:54.066
Consequently, I'd like you
to clear the area.

13:54.101 --> 13:57.403
Okay, I'm sorry,
I'm not gonna give my blessing

13:57.437 --> 14:00.106
for you to go and try and win
my girlfriend away from me.

14:00.140 --> 14:03.909
I think that
that's reasonable.

14:03.944 --> 14:05.544
Okay.

14:05.579 --> 14:06.812
Okay, and I want to thank you.

14:06.847 --> 14:08.964
I want to thank you
for having this talk with me...

14:08.999 --> 14:10.216
- Man-to-man.
- Oh, well, thank you.

14:10.250 --> 14:11.584
- Thank you very much.
- What--

14:11.618 --> 14:13.502
- what are you doing?
- I'm doing that.

14:14.253 --> 14:15.521
Are you serious?

14:15.555 --> 14:18.290
- You brought it on yourself.
- What?

14:20.585 --> 14:21.584
I've got something
I gotta say to you.

14:21.585 --> 14:23.253
- Where's Ben?
- He left.

14:23.287 --> 14:25.021
- He left?
- Yeah, he said,

14:25.056 --> 14:27.223
"I got somewhere I got to--
important to go,

14:27.258 --> 14:28.675
and I don't respect her
as a woman."

14:29.226 --> 14:30.393
He said that?

14:30.428 --> 14:33.680
And he acted more effeminate
than he does in front of you.

14:33.731 --> 14:37.500
Just--look, I got some--
something to say,

14:37.535 --> 14:40.036
and it's emotional,
and it's important.

14:40.071 --> 14:41.271
I need 30 seconds.

14:41.305 --> 14:42.856
Okay, what?
Go ahead. What is it?

14:42.907 --> 14:45.575
Okay.

14:45.609 --> 14:48.194
Romance--

14:50.381 --> 14:52.849
Hello?

14:54.285 --> 14:55.535
Are you okay?

14:55.586 --> 14:56.652
Yeah.

14:56.670 --> 14:58.722
I have to pee really bad,
ironically.

14:58.756 --> 15:00.023
What were you thinking?

15:00.057 --> 15:02.158
I was thinking
that I would cuff him,

15:02.193 --> 15:05.328
and--and then I could have time
to speak to you,

15:05.363 --> 15:07.364
and then you would decide
to be with me,

15:07.398 --> 15:09.566
and then
I would come back here,

15:09.600 --> 15:11.101
and we would uncuff him
together.

15:11.135 --> 15:12.369
Can you just uncuff him,
please?

15:12.403 --> 15:13.836
Sorry.

15:13.854 --> 15:18.074
Would you look at that?
Nature is throwing me a bone.

I'd say this to you, son,

but you may be
overthinking this.

15:32.740 --> 15:35.174
This song
has to be perfect, Ron, okay?

15:35.209 --> 15:36.609
Leslie trusted me with it.

15:36.644 --> 15:39.879
I can't come up with some
brilliant political idea, can I?

15:39.913 --> 15:42.665
This is the only way
I can help.

15:42.716 --> 15:44.217
Maybe if I hit my head
against the ground.

15:44.251 --> 15:45.635
That's worked before.

15:45.669 --> 15:47.954
Leslie is going to love it,
I promise.

15:47.988 --> 15:51.224
No offense, Ron, but what
do you know about music?

15:53.060 --> 15:54.344
Mm.

16:08.308 --> 16:11.661
Boo-boo?

16:12.595 --> 16:14.647
I don't want to say,
"I told you so,"

16:14.682 --> 16:16.315
- but...
- What?

16:16.350 --> 16:18.117
I was the one
who didn't want to go.

16:18.152 --> 16:19.652
I know. I was hoping
you wouldn't remember.

16:19.687 --> 16:20.720
I'm sorry.

16:20.754 --> 16:22.455
He was a very important person
to me,

16:22.489 --> 16:24.156
and it mattered to me
that he liked you,

16:24.174 --> 16:25.191
which is silly.

16:25.225 --> 16:26.559
Let's just go home.

16:26.593 --> 16:28.227
No, we're going
to Trumple's thing.

16:28.262 --> 16:29.696

about the endorsement,

through this any more.

16:32.833 --> 16:34.667
You don't care
about the endorsement?

16:34.702 --> 16:36.969
Leslie, let's not let
your terrible decision making

16:37.004 --> 16:38.705
get in the way
of this election.

16:42.109 --> 16:43.860
What happened to you?

16:43.894 --> 16:45.778
I was waiting outside
in the rain for you,

16:45.813 --> 16:47.413
'cause I thought
you would come out and be like,

16:47.448 --> 16:50.783
"aw, he's all wet.
That's so romantic,"

16:50.818 --> 16:54.087

and now I got the "sniffness."

16:59.693 --> 17:03.028
Why do you have to be
so "you" all the time?

17:03.046 --> 17:04.579
I'm sorry.

17:04.631 --> 17:07.215
Will you help me
get out of these wet clothes?

17:10.804 --> 17:12.722
- Hey, you want a beer?
- Oh, okay.

17:12.756 --> 17:14.540
If you're driving,
I can't give you a beer.

17:14.575 --> 17:15.974
Oh, well, then,
no, thank you.

17:16.009 --> 17:17.710
It's a celebration, man.
You have to have a drink.

17:17.744 --> 17:19.412
I'll definitely have one.

17:19.445 --> 17:20.762
Don't make a mistake
you'll always regret.

17:20.814 --> 17:23.483
Please, just tell me
what you want me to do.

17:23.517 --> 17:26.085
So, if you move here,
I hope we can be friends,

17:26.119 --> 17:27.753
but I love Ben.

17:27.788 --> 17:30.022
He comes first, and if you're
going to act like an ass,

17:30.056 --> 17:31.991
I can't talk to you, ever.

17:32.025 --> 17:33.459
Okay, that's fair.

17:33.494 --> 17:36.062
I-I'm sorry.

17:36.796 --> 17:38.464
That was dumb,
all that stuff I did.

17:38.499 --> 17:40.032
You just--
you make me crazy,

17:40.067 --> 17:42.201
and I guess
I'm just surprised that--

17:42.236 --> 17:43.920
you know, that's the guy
you fell in love with.

17:43.954 --> 17:46.105
He's very--well, he's shrimpy,
and he's small.

17:46.140 --> 17:47.840
Shrimpy or not...

17:47.875 --> 17:50.276
He's smart, and he's cute,
and he's kind, and he's funny,

17:50.310 --> 17:52.345
and he's got a great face
and nice hair, and he's--

17:52.379 --> 17:54.247
Okay, I get it.
I surrender.

17:54.281 --> 17:55.548
I just want to know

17:55.582 --> 17:58.251
that you're happy
and you're protected.

17:58.285 --> 18:00.252
I'm very happy.

18:00.270 --> 18:01.654
And he's not shrimpy.

18:01.688 --> 18:04.991
A few weeks ago, a guy called me
a bitch in a bowling alley,

18:05.025 --> 18:06.459
and he punched him
in the face.

18:06.493 --> 18:07.560
Oh, good man.

18:07.594 --> 18:09.145
I mean him,
for doing that,

18:09.196 --> 18:10.396
not the guy
who called you a bitch.

18:10.430 --> 18:13.533
You tell me where he is.
I'll punch him, too.

18:13.567 --> 18:16.335
All right, guys,
here's the deal--

18:16.370 --> 18:17.453
we got to completely
start over.

18:17.488 --> 18:18.704
I wrote a new song--
it's called

18:18.739 --> 18:20.473
<i>The Promise
Of Tomorrow's Wings.</i>

18:20.507 --> 18:22.074
It's brilliant--
about a billion times better

18:22.109 --> 18:24.644
than <i>Catch Your Dreams,</i>
which I realize now sucks ass.

18:24.678 --> 18:27.780
Hey, Chuck, go ahead and just
delete everything, all right?

18:27.798 --> 18:29.048
Hold on, Chuck.

18:29.082 --> 18:31.617
Just listen to the song
one more time,

18:31.652 --> 18:33.252
and then make a decision.

18:36.290 --> 18:39.125
♪

18:39.159 --> 18:40.960

coming from?

18:40.978 --> 18:42.395

18:42.429 --> 18:44.197

See? You just needed
to clear your head.

18:52.523 --> 18:54.490
Hey, you guys,
who is this?

18:54.525 --> 18:56.909
This looks just like--

18:56.944 --> 18:58.694
Ow, that was loud.

19:01.281 --> 19:04.083
I am telling you that Leslie,
in the long run,

19:04.117 --> 19:06.002
is so much better
for this police department

19:06.036 --> 19:07.854
than Bobby Newport is.

19:07.888 --> 19:09.121
Gun!

19:09.155 --> 19:11.040
No, no, no, no!
It's just a--it's paper.

19:11.091 --> 19:12.458
It's--I was reaching
for paper.

19:12.492 --> 19:14.927
It's all right, boys.

19:14.962 --> 19:17.730
Leslie has a plan
to raise cops' pensions

19:17.764 --> 19:20.550
and increase benefits
without cutting back on hours.

19:20.601 --> 19:22.101
Newport's
just gonna keep on

19:22.135 --> 19:23.636
buying you guys
a couple new cars

19:23.670 --> 19:25.938
or some new uniforms,
as always.

19:25.973 --> 19:29.609
That guy's all about
short-term solutions.

19:29.643 --> 19:32.612
Pretty sweet sauce in there,
eh, Ace?

19:32.646 --> 19:35.248
- What's wrong with you?
- I don't know.

19:35.282 --> 19:37.917
Trumple gave me
the endorsement, which is great,

19:37.951 --> 19:41.487
but really, the only endorsement
that matters is Ben's,

19:41.521 --> 19:43.823
and I locked that sucker up
a long time ago.

19:43.857 --> 19:45.057
Now, if you'll excuse me,

19:45.092 --> 19:46.692
I'm about endorse ten beers
into my mouth,

19:46.727 --> 19:49.545
'cause this has been
an incredibly stressful evening.

19:49.580 --> 19:50.696
Nice work, guys.

19:50.714 --> 19:52.498

19:52.532 --> 19:55.034

who's it gonna be?

19:55.552 --> 19:57.970
All right, look,
I know I messed up,

19:58.005 --> 20:00.439
but there's something
I got to say to you.

20:00.474 --> 20:04.210
No playbook, no gimmicks,
