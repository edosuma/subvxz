01:41.893 --> 01:43.350
Hell of a day when a gunfight's

01:43.437 --> 01:45.929
the second most exciting thing
happens to you.

01:49.318 --> 01:51.275
I was trying to hold out.

01:52.237 --> 01:53.773
Make you wait a bit.

01:55.907 --> 01:58.820
You seem like the type
that kind of thing matters.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.536
You don't have to do that.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.198
What?

02:06.043 --> 02:08.000
Check and see if I'm judging you.

02:08.836 --> 02:10.169
I'm not.

02:25.520 --> 02:28.638
I was so glad you weren't hurt.

02:29.691 --> 02:31.102
Came close.

02:34.529 --> 02:37.192
First time I fired my weapon
on the job.

02:42.287 --> 02:45.906
You fired your weapon before,
in the war?

02:49.461 --> 02:51.248
I wanna hear about your stuff.

02:51.797 --> 02:54.255
How you got here, your past.

02:55.759 --> 02:59.628
Honestly, I never give it thought.

03:04.851 --> 03:06.843
One thing I learned, the war?

03:08.146 --> 03:09.853
Life happens now.

03:11.566 --> 03:13.979
And later's now, you know?

03:15.112 --> 03:16.694
It's never behind you.

03:19.074 --> 03:21.657
And I'm not avoiding the question,

03:22.911 --> 03:25.528
just really don't spend time
remembering stuff.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.326
That's like a superpower to me.

03:32.254 --> 03:35.372
I can't even understand that,
how you do it.

03:35.924 --> 03:37.586
Just lucky, I guess.

04:03.118 --> 04:05.576
<i>Tell him to leave me alone.</i>

04:06.663 --> 04:09.155
<i>- I know what he did.
- Who?</i>

04:09.416 --> 04:12.625
<i>The man on TV
acting like my father.</i>

04:13.086 --> 04:15.874
<i>Can you tell me
where you're calling from?</i>

04:16.255 --> 04:18.043
<i>Where's my brother, Will?</i>

04:18.425 --> 04:19.785
<i>I don't know what he did with him.</i>

04:22.304 --> 04:24.296
That certainly sounds like
an indictment.

04:25.474 --> 04:28.558
And according to the file,
he didn't have an alibi the night of.

04:29.144 --> 04:31.602
You two never kicked that very hard,
did you?

04:31.855 --> 04:33.016
You ignored that?

04:35.317 --> 04:37.149
We need to go at him, hard.

04:37.235 --> 04:40.194
Freddy Burns saw the boy alone
out in them woods,

04:40.280 --> 04:42.237
when we still had Tom
working on his car.

04:42.824 --> 04:45.942
Me and Ted can take a shot.
Y'all wanna observe?

04:46.203 --> 04:49.367
No. We'll do it.

05:01.301 --> 05:05.090
I don't know what that call was,
but no way we could be that wrong.

05:06.932 --> 05:08.639
Wanna give it to Morelli?

05:08.725 --> 05:09.841
No.

05:10.894 --> 05:12.681
Them others will eat him alive.

05:26.243 --> 05:27.484
What's it mean?

05:29.120 --> 05:31.282
- That was her, wasn't it?
- Sit down, Tom.

05:31.373 --> 05:34.286
- I don't wanna sit down right now.
- It's not a request.

05:38.672 --> 05:40.584
<i>What are you looking like that for?</i>

05:42.843 --> 05:44.709
Something you wanna tell us,
Mr. Purcell?

05:44.803 --> 05:45.803
What?

05:45.887 --> 05:48.174
However long it's been,
it's the time,

05:48.265 --> 05:50.382
while you're talking
to a couple of friends.

05:50.475 --> 05:53.593
'Cause they bring in the other guys,
it's gonna get bad.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.223
Tell us your side.

05:55.480 --> 05:58.598
We can help. Make a case for you.

05:59.484 --> 06:00.850
My side?

06:02.445 --> 06:04.437
Everybody knows my side.

06:09.786 --> 06:11.778
You think me?

06:17.210 --> 06:19.623
Back in '80,
the night of the incident,

06:21.506 --> 06:24.715
couple of neighbors saw you
working in the garage, early evening.

06:26.261 --> 06:28.844
Don't have anybody saw you after 6:30.

06:29.097 --> 06:30.463
Saw me?

06:32.350 --> 06:33.761
Roland...

06:39.190 --> 06:40.647
Lieutenant West.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.358
You go somewhere back then?

06:43.987 --> 06:46.479
You leave the house
and forgot to tell us?

06:46.907 --> 06:48.068
No.

06:48.450 --> 06:52.069
No. I went back inside,
I had a couple beers

06:52.162 --> 06:55.451
and listened to the Cardinals game,
same as I told you.

06:56.124 --> 06:57.365
Julie's room...

06:59.294 --> 07:01.877
There's a little hole in her wall

07:03.298 --> 07:05.381
came out back of Will's closet.

07:07.302 --> 07:08.463
A what?

07:08.803 --> 07:11.170
<i>Like a peephole. For spying.</i>

07:11.848 --> 07:13.840
<i>Ever look in on her? Julie?</i>

07:14.601 --> 07:16.558
<i>Maybe while she was getting dressed?</i>

07:19.189 --> 07:22.682
Some question, wasn't there,
whether she was yours?

07:23.360 --> 07:25.477
Lucy passed it around a lot,
what we hear.

07:25.570 --> 07:27.357
Listen, she...

07:28.782 --> 07:33.402
I held...
I fed her, got up in the night.

07:33.495 --> 07:35.737
She's mine. That child is mine.

07:37.165 --> 07:39.248
How could you,
after everything you know,

07:39.334 --> 07:41.371
you think I could
do something like that?

07:41.461 --> 07:43.248
Do you? You?

07:44.881 --> 07:47.089
- Did you give her to somebody, Tom?
- What?

07:47.175 --> 07:49.588
- Was she trying to get away from you?
- What?

07:49.678 --> 07:51.715
Somebody helping her
out of a situation with you?

07:51.805 --> 07:53.717
- What? Why?
- Did Will know? Did he catch you?

07:53.807 --> 07:55.673
Why? Why? Goddamn, why would I...

07:55.767 --> 07:57.912
You know they weren't playing
with that neighbor kid.

07:57.936 --> 07:59.973
Who were they meeting at Devil's Den?

08:01.815 --> 08:05.729
I don't know. I don't know
anything you're talking about.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.903
No, no, no, no...

08:12.993 --> 08:14.325
Tell us about it.

08:15.620 --> 08:18.988
We wanna help you,
but we can't if you don't talk to us.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.247
<i>I don't know.</i>

08:29.551 --> 08:32.259
Usually, I do, but I don't know.

08:33.304 --> 08:35.511
I can't believe we missed this.

08:36.099 --> 08:38.182
I mean, could he have
colluded with Woodard?

08:38.268 --> 08:41.682
Come to that, could he have planted
the items in Woodard's house?

08:44.733 --> 08:47.271
There's no evidence
right now for an arrest.

08:47.736 --> 08:49.068
Hold him for the 24.

08:49.487 --> 08:51.549
Start digging for anything
that points in his direction.

08:51.573 --> 08:53.485
I'm gonna give you a warrant
for his place.

08:54.325 --> 08:57.443
We need to check out
where that call came from, too.

08:57.537 --> 08:58.903
Get busy.

08:58.997 --> 09:02.832
We missed it once,
we're not losing him now.

09:07.297 --> 09:09.835
<i>The phone call was viewed
as a major turn, correct?</i>

09:13.386 --> 09:16.220
Law enforcement seemed to
consider it as an indictment,

09:16.306 --> 09:20.391
particularly in light of
what happened.

09:24.939 --> 09:26.680
What happened?

09:28.068 --> 09:29.229
Huh?

09:31.321 --> 09:33.859
After questioning,
Tom Purcell was held in jail.

09:34.449 --> 09:37.192
What did investigators do
after that phone call?

09:37.619 --> 09:40.157
That was her, wasn't it? Julie?

09:40.580 --> 09:41.946
Mmm-hmm.

09:43.416 --> 09:45.783
Call came from a truck stop
outside Russellville.

09:47.045 --> 09:48.957
<i>We pulled a partial
off of a payphone.</i>

09:49.798 --> 09:50.834
<i>Hers.</i>

09:52.383 --> 09:55.876
You didn't wanna tell the bosses
about the backpack?

09:56.554 --> 09:58.887
You were pretty convinced
it was planted.

09:59.265 --> 10:00.676
It was planted.

10:02.352 --> 10:04.232
I didn't wanna give them that
to use on him yet.

10:19.786 --> 10:20.902
Hey.

10:21.162 --> 10:22.243
Hey.

10:22.330 --> 10:24.572
Had to change. Gotta go back out.

10:24.666 --> 10:25.907
Okay.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.577
Missing my old clip-ons.

10:32.298 --> 10:33.505
Shit.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.843
You're not
in elementary school anymore.

10:43.768 --> 10:45.475
Where you going?

10:46.312 --> 10:48.019
I have things to do.

10:49.023 --> 10:50.184
New book.

10:50.900 --> 10:52.186
What new book?

10:53.069 --> 10:54.150
Sequel.

10:55.363 --> 10:57.776
It's about the current investigation.

10:58.992 --> 11:01.484
I thought you wanted
to work on a novel next.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.782
The publisher wants this bad.

11:04.289 --> 11:06.281
They think
it's too good an opportunity.

11:07.250 --> 11:10.664
I get troubled calling what happened
an "opportunity."

11:11.629 --> 11:13.291
That's their word.

11:15.008 --> 11:18.797
You can't expect the world to conform
to Wayne Hays's moral semantics.

11:20.597 --> 11:21.838
Right.

11:22.015 --> 11:24.678
Well, it's an opportunity for you,
isn't it?

11:25.393 --> 11:27.100
Back to Major Crimes.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.603
Keeping your own hours.

11:30.440 --> 11:33.433
We get clear on this,
I'll be home more.

11:34.652 --> 11:35.984
Will you?

11:36.779 --> 11:38.395
Seems like this suits you better.

11:38.740 --> 11:40.276
Running free.

11:42.493 --> 11:44.280
Just trying to do my job right.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.203
So, that's my imagination,

11:47.790 --> 11:50.157
seeing you
like you can't breathe in here?

11:50.335 --> 11:52.292
Yeah, it's your imagination.

11:52.378 --> 11:54.961
Telling yourself stories about me,
my motives.

11:55.048 --> 11:56.835
I could tell stories.

11:56.925 --> 11:59.405
Why you're all of a sudden
working on a book you already wrote.

12:00.094 --> 12:03.178
What you looking for out there,
you're not finding here.

12:11.689 --> 12:14.978
<i>We dug into Tom.
The father, yeah.</i>

12:15.485 --> 12:18.353
<i>His place. Talked to his bosses.</i>

12:19.447 --> 12:21.734
I remember talking to y'all back then.

12:22.617 --> 12:26.110
Yeah, he quit before
the school bus factory closed.

12:27.580 --> 12:31.369
Tell you the truth,
he was on his way out

12:32.377 --> 12:34.164
even before what happened.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.211
Why's that?

12:36.297 --> 12:39.290
Caught him drinking on the job
more than once.

12:39.759 --> 12:42.217
Machines are dangerous
around that shit.

12:42.971 --> 12:46.180
Always asking for a loan.
And, you know,

12:46.266 --> 12:48.929
didn't quite get along
with the rest of the guys.

12:49.352 --> 12:50.843
How do you mean?

12:50.937 --> 12:53.099
I didn't wanna say anything back then,

12:54.232 --> 12:57.896
but a few of the boys had around
saw him going into a queer club.

12:59.988 --> 13:01.775
They got on him a lot, after.

14:30.203 --> 14:32.616
So, he's not
the saint of all suffering.

14:34.082 --> 14:36.119
Everybody's got weaknesses.

14:38.002 --> 14:40.164
Don't mean he did that to his kids.

14:40.254 --> 14:42.917
Looking less and less to me
like they were his kids.

14:44.926 --> 14:47.213
Devil's Den was a homo cruising spot.

14:47.595 --> 14:49.632
The kids weren't
supposed to be out there.

14:50.139 --> 14:51.755
- If Tom was...
- Fuck off.

14:52.767 --> 14:55.475
We know they were meeting
somebody else out there.

14:57.063 --> 14:58.554
Tom wouldn't do that.

14:58.648 --> 15:00.105
- This.
- Hey.

15:00.191 --> 15:02.148
If he wouldn't, then we'll clear him.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.941
But we gotta get this right.
You saw at the station.

15:07.698 --> 15:10.691
Kindt and Blevins are hot for it.

15:12.453 --> 15:14.240
If it's not him,

15:14.997 --> 15:16.408
we clear him.

15:17.208 --> 15:18.574
But we don't stop.

15:19.293 --> 15:21.125
Take it all the way this time.

15:29.095 --> 15:30.836
I remember 1980.

16:02.128 --> 16:03.744
You're supposed to be at home.

16:04.755 --> 16:05.916
Detective Hays.

16:07.341 --> 16:09.628
Your shooting cleared. No surprise.

16:10.261 --> 16:12.048
What's the latest on Roland?

16:12.305 --> 16:13.796
Gets to keep the leg.

16:14.932 --> 16:16.639
Won't be the same,
but it's a lot better

16:16.726 --> 16:18.012
than Diller and Bowen got.

16:18.102 --> 16:21.186
They found the boy's backpack.
Girl's shirt.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.893
Both at Woodard's place.

16:24.442 --> 16:26.229
Yeah, it was him.

16:26.736 --> 16:27.943
What?

16:30.781 --> 16:32.522
No, something's wrong here.

16:33.075 --> 16:35.237
If it was him, that ain't all of it.

16:36.037 --> 16:38.575
Other people involved.
Kids were meeting somebody.

16:38.664 --> 16:41.156
- Jesus Christ, you were there.
- Wayne.

16:41.250 --> 16:43.082
You see what's happening out here?

16:43.169 --> 16:46.082
Press is making the county
a <i>Hee Haw</i> sideshow.

16:46.172 --> 16:47.612
May have gotten some help with that.

16:47.715 --> 16:49.923
Okay, Detective,
stick to the evidence.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.966
And it only goes one way.

16:52.261 --> 16:56.471
Even makes sense for the kidnap note.
Cut-out words, misspelling.

16:56.891 --> 16:58.007
It was Woodard.

16:58.392 --> 16:59.803
Then where's the girl?

16:59.894 --> 17:03.103
He had a couple of oil drums
he made into an incinerator.

17:03.189 --> 17:05.181
Evidence suggests he burned the body.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.983
- Are we sure?
- She's dead.

17:09.069 --> 17:11.938
Let's not draw out
the family's pain any longer.

17:12.031 --> 17:14.898
Our official position is
Woodard murdered both children.

17:14.992 --> 17:17.233
That's it. Take some time.

17:17.787 --> 17:21.201
- Probably a medal in this.
- Warren, I don't wanna take time.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.060
I don't give a shit about medals.
I'm telling you...

17:23.084 --> 17:26.748
Enough. He killed 10 people, Wayne.
You were there.

17:27.588 --> 17:28.874
It's done.

17:29.423 --> 17:32.791
This community needs to heal,
Detective. We're the first step.

17:33.970 --> 17:38.260
And state law allows conviction in
absentia under special circumstances.

17:38.349 --> 17:40.466
Our offices are gonna need
all evidence,

17:40.560 --> 17:42.893
your investigative records,
everything.

17:45.481 --> 17:46.847
Twelve people.

17:47.984 --> 17:48.984
What?

17:50.111 --> 17:53.525
You putting the kids on him,
that means he killed 12 people,

17:54.532 --> 17:55.898
not 10.

17:57.910 --> 18:00.243
Just so you keep
your stories straight.

18:03.708 --> 18:05.449
The cousin, Dan O'Brien,

18:06.168 --> 18:09.582
his remains were found in a drained
quarry in southern Missouri.

18:10.506 --> 18:12.418
Do you think
this could connect to Tom?

18:13.509 --> 18:14.875
I don't know.

18:15.636 --> 18:16.877
Couldn't say.

18:17.263 --> 18:22.304
Well, what happened with Tom,
Lucy, now her cousin Dan...

18:22.393 --> 18:24.305
We also had to talk to all the cops

18:24.770 --> 18:27.433
who worked the Woodard scene
back in '80.

18:28.691 --> 18:32.184
I believe that's what we did next,
or around then.

18:32.570 --> 18:35.529
Because the thought was that Tom
may have planted the evidence there?

18:36.115 --> 18:39.324
Well, we had to look
at the possibility.

18:42.330 --> 18:44.993
Or maybe they worked together,
him and Woodard.

18:46.917 --> 18:52.129
You know, it's terrible
what this work makes you ponder.

18:54.175 --> 18:56.212
Don't you think?

18:58.721 --> 19:01.134
Might've seen him. Hard to say.

19:01.223 --> 19:02.863
Had a lot of lookie-loos
around the place.

19:03.184 --> 19:04.704
And you're the one found the backpack?

19:06.729 --> 19:08.436
Yeah. Yeah, I found it.

19:08.522 --> 19:11.060
Then Harris said
looked like that boy's.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.857
- That's Harris James?
- Yeah.

19:13.527 --> 19:14.938
Says he left the force.

19:15.029 --> 19:16.770
Oh, yeah, a long time ago.

19:16.864 --> 19:18.981
You know what he's doing now?

19:34.048 --> 19:35.755
"Chief Security Officer."

19:36.801 --> 19:39.088
How do I get something like that?

19:39.178 --> 19:41.295
Well, I moonlighted security
at the plant

19:41.389 --> 19:43.722
for about five years
when I was a patrolman.

19:43.808 --> 19:46.846
When the spot opened up here,
I was in the right place.

19:47.228 --> 19:50.141
I don't know why a lieutenant
would wanna switch careers.

19:50.523 --> 19:53.641
That matter, I don't know I ever heard
a lieutenant working the field.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.651
It's a special situation.

19:57.279 --> 20:01.114
If I get your salary,
I'll switch to any career they say.

20:02.326 --> 20:04.318
What, you look at my paycheck?

20:04.995 --> 20:06.907
Pretty depressing from my end.

20:09.500 --> 20:12.083
You took the job May '81?

20:13.129 --> 20:14.370
That's right.

20:14.714 --> 20:17.582
We're backtracking. The Purcell case.

20:18.968 --> 20:21.802
Got it down you were the one
spotted the bag.

20:21.887 --> 20:23.469
No, I didn't find it.

20:23.556 --> 20:27.800
I was the first to think
I recognized it, off the APB.

20:28.185 --> 20:31.678
Well, we've been wondering why it took
two days to find that backpack.

20:31.772 --> 20:33.934
Took God six days to make the world.

20:34.817 --> 20:38.606
I can believe it took a bunch of GEDs
two days to find a backpack.

20:44.118 --> 20:45.484
The kids' father.

20:45.995 --> 20:49.579
You ever see him out there
when you were processing the scene?

20:50.249 --> 20:53.833
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I saw him
in the field across the street.

20:53.919 --> 20:55.000
Watching.

20:55.129 --> 20:56.415
What was he doing?

20:57.757 --> 20:59.168
Just staring.

20:59.258 --> 21:02.376
Stood there looking at the house,
or what was left of it.

21:02.720 --> 21:04.302
Long time.

21:05.139 --> 21:08.132
You know, the kids' mother
used to work up here.

21:08.225 --> 21:09.966
Back in '79.

21:10.352 --> 21:12.122
Well, unless she worked
10:00 to 6:00 in the morning,

21:12.146 --> 21:13.478
I never saw her.

21:14.607 --> 21:17.771
That was y'all, right? The shootout?

21:18.277 --> 21:19.859
That's my fucking limp.

21:21.530 --> 21:23.237
Why'd you leave Highway Patrol?

21:24.742 --> 21:28.201
Why'd I give up hemorrhoids
and 15K a year? I don't know.

21:28.454 --> 21:30.662
That question keeps me up nights.

21:40.758 --> 21:44.001
What's the job involve?
Money like that.

21:45.679 --> 21:47.045
Hog thieves?

21:47.765 --> 21:50.633
People trying to steal
the secret chicken recipe?

21:54.772 --> 21:56.604
"Securing without compromise

21:56.690 --> 21:59.228
"the integrity of corporate assets

21:59.318 --> 22:02.811
"while guarding against hazards
to daily operations."

22:03.656 --> 22:06.364
But I'll admit, now and then,
I miss whiling away my days,

22:06.450 --> 22:08.362
cruising around, eating donuts.

22:09.495 --> 22:11.031
I don't eat donuts.

22:11.455 --> 22:12.741
I can tell.

22:13.999 --> 22:16.116
You got a good body, Detective.

22:17.545 --> 22:19.286
Appreciate your time.

22:19.922 --> 22:21.413
We'll get outta your hair.

22:29.598 --> 22:32.682
I thought it took God
seven days to make the world.

22:33.060 --> 22:34.847
He rested on the seventh.

22:35.896 --> 22:38.229
I always thought he should've
put the extra day in,

22:38.315 --> 22:39.601
instead of half-assing it.

22:41.402 --> 22:42.893
Harris James?

22:42.987 --> 22:45.604
He was one of the officers
who processed the Woodard scene.

22:46.365 --> 22:49.949
He disappeared
during the 1990 investigation.

22:50.786 --> 22:51.902
Huh.

22:52.621 --> 22:54.112
Know what happened to him?

22:54.498 --> 22:57.832
No. But the mother, the father,

22:58.335 --> 23:00.418
the cousin's body being found now,

23:00.796 --> 23:02.503
all the dead at Woodard's,

23:02.798 --> 23:04.630
this former cop worked the scene.

23:05.551 --> 23:08.464
I wonder if one day
they'll drain a quarry with him in it.

23:11.265 --> 23:13.302
I wouldn't know, miss.

23:14.935 --> 23:17.894
But what you just did
is called speculation.

23:17.980 --> 23:19.892
That leads to projection, we call it.

23:19.982 --> 23:22.690
Twists what you see, obfuscates truth.

23:23.068 --> 23:26.027
Have you sat back at any point
over the last two decades

23:26.113 --> 23:30.232
and thought about the sheer number
of fatalities surrounding this case?

23:40.377 --> 23:43.370
I'm afraid I need to stop for today.

23:44.298 --> 23:46.085
I'm sorry, can you give us
five more minutes?

23:46.175 --> 23:47.382
I didn't mean to press.

23:47.468 --> 23:49.209
You're fine. I'm just done.

23:51.555 --> 23:53.217
All I meant...

23:53.307 --> 23:55.702
Doesn't the simple body count
point toward something bigger...

23:55.726 --> 23:58.059
- Stop. He's done.
- I'm getting to the point.

23:58.145 --> 24:00.933
Then you should have
gotten to it sooner. Okay?

24:06.862 --> 24:08.398
Thanks so much for your help.

24:08.906 --> 24:10.738
Do you work with a lot of young girls?

24:10.866 --> 24:12.448
We get a fair amount.

24:12.534 --> 24:15.777
Runaways, girls trying
to get away from bad homes.

24:16.038 --> 24:17.825
We just lose so many.

24:20.292 --> 24:22.454
I can't say I recognize her.

24:23.837 --> 24:25.794
But that's not the best picture,
is it?

24:28.509 --> 24:32.048
The idea is
maybe it's this little girl, grown up.

24:37.226 --> 24:38.683
Here we are.

24:42.106 --> 24:44.439
Yeah, we were in the same group.

24:46.235 --> 24:49.694
That was four or five months ago,
I think?

24:50.948 --> 24:52.439
Why did she leave?

24:53.242 --> 24:57.657
Things had gotten kind of shaky.
Drugs.

24:58.580 --> 25:01.698
One of the guys had gotten
some of the girls to trick.

25:02.543 --> 25:04.626
Just got ugly.

25:06.255 --> 25:09.089
I dropped out
a couple weeks after Mary.

25:09.466 --> 25:11.173
She called herself "Mary"?

25:11.719 --> 25:12.880
Sometimes.

25:13.387 --> 25:15.549
Or Mary-Julie.

25:16.265 --> 25:20.680
And sometimes Mary-July,
like Julie, but July.

25:21.603 --> 25:23.469
"Like summertime," she said.

25:24.356 --> 25:25.392
She had different names.

25:29.737 --> 25:31.524
She ever talk about herself?

25:32.239 --> 25:34.856
Talk about home?
Where she came from?

25:35.451 --> 25:39.115
She mentioned something about,
"Living in the pink rooms"?

25:39.204 --> 25:43.369
Or "A queen in a pink castle."

25:44.960 --> 25:45.960
You know what I think?

25:47.713 --> 25:50.000
I think she didn't know who she was.

25:50.466 --> 25:52.799
I think she just pretended.

25:55.054 --> 25:56.795
You oughta write a book.

25:58.640 --> 26:01.678
Write about what happens
to kids out here.

26:03.771 --> 26:05.683
What happens to girls.

26:15.449 --> 26:17.169
<i>D-12, you around? Over.</i>

26:22.498 --> 26:23.579
D-12. We're here.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.199
<i>Got a call on the hotline.</i>

26:26.293 --> 26:28.831
<i>Guy says he wants to talk
to Lieutenant West.</i>

26:28.921 --> 26:30.128
<i>Says he knows him.</i>

26:31.799 --> 26:33.415
What guy? Who?

26:33.967 --> 26:35.674
<i>Gave us a number to call.</i>

26:37.429 --> 26:38.886
Go ahead.

27:02.663 --> 27:04.154
Y'all still together?

27:04.957 --> 27:06.573
Right on.

27:06.834 --> 27:08.666
You're a hard man to find.

27:11.880 --> 27:13.416
Where you been?

27:14.716 --> 27:16.548
Time being what it is,
I imagine you boys

27:16.635 --> 27:18.592
would rather I stick
to what's relevant.

27:18.679 --> 27:22.798
Which is that justice might
finally be done for Lucy and her kids.

27:23.559 --> 27:26.222
Gonna need you to make
your fucking point, Dan.

27:26.311 --> 27:31.648
My point is Tom going on TV,
Julie being alive.

27:31.942 --> 27:34.059
Now, there are questions
that you cannot answer

27:34.153 --> 27:35.644
without what information I know.

27:35.737 --> 27:39.651
You know something you're not saying,
we can put you away right now.

27:39.741 --> 27:41.949
Or we can take you somewhere,
kick the hell out of you

27:42.035 --> 27:44.675
till we're convinced that you're
as full of shit as you look to me.

27:48.292 --> 27:51.376
- I want $7,000.
- I want a boat.

27:51.795 --> 27:54.208
It's clear from the news
that y'all don't know any more now

27:54.298 --> 27:55.459
than you did then.

27:55.549 --> 27:57.711
But when you can
deliver to me that amount,

27:57.801 --> 27:59.793
hey, you're gonna know
a whole lot more.

27:59.887 --> 28:02.846
I imagine a whole lot of your
confusion's just gonna clear right up.

28:07.561 --> 28:10.850
You're working on getting your head
bounced off that fucking curb.

28:12.774 --> 28:16.188
I been getting the shit beat outta me
since I was two years old.

28:16.278 --> 28:18.019
Way before Lucy came to live with us.

28:19.114 --> 28:20.525
- Live with you?
- Yeah.

28:20.616 --> 28:24.109
She moved in, she was four.
After her mama passed.

28:24.703 --> 28:29.664
Her and I, we sort of shared
a lot of milestones, growing up.

28:35.047 --> 28:36.047
First time we talked,

28:36.965 --> 28:39.298
it was clear that
you can't speak without lying.

28:39.384 --> 28:41.125
Why should we believe you now?

28:43.347 --> 28:45.304
Hey, you ignore me if you want.

28:45.724 --> 28:47.260
But if you guys try muscling me,

28:47.351 --> 28:49.593
this ain't gonna work out for anyone.
Hmm?

28:50.229 --> 28:53.017
Look, I got you out here
because you looking for Julie again,

28:53.106 --> 28:55.501
that means that right now,
there are people trying to make sure

28:55.525 --> 28:57.212
that none of your questions
can ever be answered.

28:57.236 --> 28:58.602
What people?

29:00.447 --> 29:03.656
People who do not renegotiate.

29:04.159 --> 29:06.902
People who it was in their interest
to make Lucy look like she OD'd.

29:07.579 --> 29:09.787
What, you saying she was murdered?

29:12.960 --> 29:16.374
Lucy, she had this problem,
self-defeating.

29:17.673 --> 29:19.539
She didn't know when to stop pushing.

29:19.758 --> 29:22.216
She'd push till she got
what she wanted,

29:22.302 --> 29:26.171
and then she'd keep on pushing
till she got what she didn't want.

29:26.265 --> 29:27.631
Y'all ever know anybody like that?

29:27.724 --> 29:29.590
Let's throw him in the hole
for a week,

29:29.685 --> 29:32.769
- see what he remembers then.
- You think she has a week? Hmm?

29:33.438 --> 29:36.681
I'll just remember that
I'm a sick person who got called away,

29:36.775 --> 29:39.643
carried up in his imagination,
telling stories to the police.

29:39.736 --> 29:42.228
And while y'all are threatening me
and beating me and whatnot,

29:42.322 --> 29:43.800
what you're really doing
is making sure

29:43.824 --> 29:45.065
that the truth of what happened

29:45.158 --> 29:47.992
vanishes from the face
of the fucking planet.

29:48.161 --> 29:50.619
What happened to her
have anything to do with Tom?

29:53.083 --> 29:55.791
Man, y'all are really far off,
aren't you?

29:56.003 --> 29:58.398
You think that I'd be scared
of sticking my head above ground

29:58.422 --> 30:00.254
'cause of that little cocksucker?
Shit.

30:00.549 --> 30:03.883
The people you're saying hurt Lucy,
that involve the kids?

30:05.345 --> 30:09.760
What am I... Yes, God damn it. Yes.
It's all about the kids.

30:09.933 --> 30:13.097
And my way is the only way
this works for us.

30:13.186 --> 30:15.052
Now, you procure my funds,
we meet back here,

30:15.147 --> 30:16.888
say, tomorrow, maybe the next day,

30:16.982 --> 30:19.019
you're gonna see the solution
to your problems.

30:19.109 --> 30:21.772
It's gonna take more than couple days
to put that money together.

30:21.862 --> 30:23.462
You ain't got
much longer than that.

30:23.947 --> 30:26.940
Like I keep saying, you ain't
the only ones looking for Julie.

30:38.420 --> 30:39.911
You can't be so fucked in the head

30:40.005 --> 30:42.543
where you're thinking
we're gonna let you walk outta here.

30:45.802 --> 30:47.714
Hey, maybe I misspoke, hmm?

30:48.597 --> 30:49.883
I mean, look at me.

30:49.973 --> 30:52.966
This basket case junkie,
can't tell night from day,

30:53.060 --> 30:54.676
taking up your valuable time.

30:54.770 --> 30:57.353
I mean, probably I'm just a crazy man
you should ignore.

30:57.439 --> 30:59.772
I speak crazy. I'm fucking fluent.

31:04.696 --> 31:08.861
Tick-tock. Clock's ticking
for our girl out there, Detectives.

31:09.326 --> 31:10.887
And them others
that are looking for her,

31:10.911 --> 31:12.823
they got a serious head start
on you all.

31:15.707 --> 31:18.541
Look, I'll call you
day after tomorrow.

31:19.753 --> 31:23.713
Unless you all would rather we keep
having this fucking staring contest.

31:39.064 --> 31:42.808
Maybe I'm a nervous Nellie,
but I catch any cops following me,

31:43.318 --> 31:44.650
this shit's off.

31:46.488 --> 31:47.945
Thanks for breakfast.

32:04.589 --> 32:06.501
Believe this?

32:08.135 --> 32:09.717
Think he's telling the truth?

32:09.803 --> 32:12.403
I think we need to get
the phone records from Lucy's hotel.

32:12.431 --> 32:15.595
Two years back. Yeah.

32:16.059 --> 32:19.894
Think we need to figure out exactly
where Tom was when she died.

32:19.980 --> 32:21.312
He didn't like Tom for it.

32:24.067 --> 32:28.937
Well, I also think we oughta see about
requisitioning that seven thou.

32:31.825 --> 32:33.316
Keep eyes on this trash.

32:43.211 --> 32:44.952
Go on. You're getting out.

32:47.674 --> 32:49.506
I wanna see Lieutenant West.

32:49.885 --> 32:51.547
That's not my problem.

33:05.984 --> 33:09.523
That was the lieutenant.
They just had lunch with our dirtbag.

33:11.781 --> 33:14.740
- How's that?
- The uncle or whatever. Dan O'Brien.

33:15.243 --> 33:16.700
Met him some diner.

33:17.287 --> 33:19.495
Says he has the whole story,
wants a payout.

33:19.581 --> 33:22.289
Fuck that. Give me an hour
in a room with him.

33:22.501 --> 33:24.083
And they want us to get phone records.

33:24.294 --> 33:27.128
Diamond Cactus Motel
in Paradise, Nevada.

33:27.506 --> 33:30.249
Two years back.
Lucy's phone records.

33:30.342 --> 33:32.550
Yeah, that's good use
of our time, huh?

33:33.136 --> 33:34.252
Where's O'Brien now?

33:34.721 --> 33:36.257
They gave us a plate to run,

33:36.348 --> 33:38.214
but sounds like
he's still in the wind.

33:47.734 --> 33:48.920
You're acting like a child.

33:48.944 --> 33:50.296
I'm not acting like a child.

33:50.320 --> 33:51.881
You don't give a shit
about anybody but yourself!

33:51.905 --> 33:53.049
You're acting like a child.

33:53.073 --> 33:55.440
Okay, forget it! This was a mistake.

34:08.255 --> 34:09.416
Hey.

34:10.674 --> 34:12.005
You're smoking now?

34:12.592 --> 34:15.630
Seemed like time
to stop depriving myself.

34:32.112 --> 34:33.978
You gonna keep going on with her,

34:35.072 --> 34:36.780
after she's done filming?

34:41.161 --> 34:42.572
What do you mean?

34:43.373 --> 34:46.241
Have a hard time
seeing you in New York City.

34:53.550 --> 34:55.132
How'd you know?

34:56.386 --> 34:58.127
I'm still your daddy, boy.

35:01.141 --> 35:04.851
Additionally, I was once
a fair-to-middling detective.

35:10.233 --> 35:11.565
I feel bad.

35:12.277 --> 35:13.859
And Heather, I mean, she's...

35:14.654 --> 35:16.611
She's a good woman, you know?

35:17.699 --> 35:19.190
She know about it?

35:23.371 --> 35:24.737
I gotta tell her, huh?

35:27.792 --> 35:29.124
Are you leaving her?

35:29.878 --> 35:31.335
No.

35:31.421 --> 35:33.538
You're ending the other thing.

35:34.758 --> 35:37.717
There's something to be said
for truth just hurting her,

35:38.261 --> 35:40.628
causing pain 'cause you feel guilty.

35:41.681 --> 35:43.047
Is that fair?

35:43.975 --> 35:46.012
You feeling better, she feeling worse?

35:46.102 --> 35:49.721
I never did anything like this before,
Pop, I want you to know that.

35:49.814 --> 35:52.227
I didn't plan it.
You know, she just...

35:54.819 --> 35:56.856
She was exciting.

35:57.781 --> 35:59.488
They're exciting, all right.

35:59.574 --> 36:01.987
And me and Heather,
it's not like it used to be.

36:04.120 --> 36:07.488
Nothing stays like it used to be.

36:13.129 --> 36:15.462
I been looking at myself a lot.

36:16.716 --> 36:21.336
And I'm asking this question for me,
so I know.

36:22.514 --> 36:23.755
What?

36:24.891 --> 36:30.182
Did you find that I...

36:34.275 --> 36:36.187
Did I teach you to withhold?

36:37.445 --> 36:39.277
I don't understand the question.

36:43.743 --> 36:47.987
I didn't intend that.
I didn't realize it was happening.

36:54.879 --> 36:57.212
I got those addresses you wanted.

36:59.592 --> 37:01.003
The names.

37:03.179 --> 37:04.795
What are you planning?

37:11.229 --> 37:15.473
Before you ever knew me,
I wasn't scared much.

37:17.277 --> 37:19.018
I wasn't a fearful man.

37:21.364 --> 37:24.072
I did things some people
even called brave.

37:26.536 --> 37:28.653
Y'all made a coward of me.

37:30.039 --> 37:32.577
I been terrified since
the day you were born.

37:34.711 --> 37:37.078
Maybe you know what I mean.

37:40.383 --> 37:43.626
Can't shrink from it.
Can't be stingy, son.

37:43.720 --> 37:45.427
People you love,

37:46.848 --> 37:49.716
can't hold it back, see?

37:50.435 --> 37:52.267
Can't hold back anything.

37:55.398 --> 37:57.560
I gotta make a phone call, Pop.

38:20.590 --> 38:24.004
Due to the shocking
and horrific events three days ago,

38:24.552 --> 38:29.889
our offices have reached a conclusion
in the case of Will and Julie Purcell.

38:31.017 --> 38:35.011
New evidence suggests that
Brett Woodard murdered both children.

38:36.397 --> 38:39.765
Now, we will pursue
a conviction in absentia,

38:40.318 --> 38:43.026
due to the terrible nature
of his crimes,

38:43.655 --> 38:45.146
and it is our hope

38:45.740 --> 38:47.276
that the community will begin to heal

38:47.367 --> 38:49.233
from these events
which have shaken us all.

38:49.327 --> 38:51.167
Have they found
the girl's remains?

38:51.788 --> 38:53.349
We have evidence,
but I don't wish to say more

38:53.373 --> 38:55.080
under the present circumstances.

38:55.166 --> 38:56.998
Was Woodard under investigation?

38:57.085 --> 38:59.919
He was very much a person of interest.
We were looking at him.

39:00.004 --> 39:02.441
Were you close
to an arrest, is that why he snapped?

39:02.465 --> 39:03.776
Well, I believe it's very likely

39:03.800 --> 39:05.200
that the pressure, maybe the guilt,

39:05.260 --> 39:08.549
drove him to explode
before he could be brought to trial.

39:08.638 --> 39:11.130
But make no mistake,
that was an act of suicide

39:11.391 --> 39:13.804
where he wanted to take
as many with him as he could.

39:14.352 --> 39:17.186
Brett Woodard
was interrogated early on, correct?

39:17.689 --> 39:19.897
Why wasn't he held
during the time of questioning?

39:20.483 --> 39:22.065
A lack of evidence.

39:22.151 --> 39:25.019
We are bound by our common law,
which preserve the rights of all men,

39:25.113 --> 39:28.527
even those as malignant
and as vicious as Mr. Woodard.

39:31.953 --> 39:34.946
Mrs. Purcell.
Do you have a statement at this time?

39:35.039 --> 39:37.201
"Leave me the fuck alone"
is my statement.

39:37.292 --> 39:39.784
- Do you feel justice has been done?
- Justice?

39:39.878 --> 39:42.495
The fuck are you talking about?
What's that even mean, huh?

39:42.589 --> 39:44.706
- Here? Now?
- Mrs. Purcell...

39:44.799 --> 39:46.711
Just leave her alone.
This is harassment.

39:46.801 --> 39:48.884
It's my job. I'm just trying
to get the story right.

39:48.970 --> 39:50.586
If I don't,
someone else'll get it wrong.

39:50.680 --> 39:52.216
That is no excuse.

39:52.307 --> 39:53.764
The fuck do you want, teacher?

39:53.850 --> 39:55.762
I just wanna apologize
for how we left things...

39:55.852 --> 39:59.471
Don't apologize to me.
Ever. For anything.

40:00.023 --> 40:02.561
You two bitches,
you talk to each other.

40:02.650 --> 40:04.437
Make up a story on your own.

40:36.476 --> 40:40.015
Be ironic, that shitbird clears Tom.

40:47.362 --> 40:48.853
It's something, isn't it?

40:49.322 --> 40:51.405
How quick this town died.

40:52.742 --> 40:54.950
Didn't die. Got murdered.

40:56.871 --> 41:00.160
We oughta look at who else might've
planted the backpack and shirt.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.536
Could've been anybody.

41:03.711 --> 41:06.920
But I wouldn't clear Tom just yet.
The man has secrets.

41:08.341 --> 41:11.254
Get back to the office,
wanna look up that church program,

41:11.344 --> 41:12.710
more co-workers.

41:15.640 --> 41:18.098
Wait. Where we going?

41:18.559 --> 41:20.676
I'm taking you home. What you think?

41:20.812 --> 41:22.644
I'm not going home. I'm working.

41:22.730 --> 41:24.170
It'll still be there in the morning.

41:24.732 --> 41:28.521
Come on, man. O'Brien?
We got the scent.

41:29.237 --> 41:30.819
Let's get back, strategize,

41:30.905 --> 41:33.773
maybe talk to somebody in Vice
about the queer underground.

41:33.866 --> 41:35.027
Just stop, all right?

41:35.910 --> 41:38.323
You don't wanna go home,
don't go home.

41:38.413 --> 41:40.029
But don't make it the job.

41:40.123 --> 41:41.489
Maybe we just work it different.

41:41.582 --> 41:43.198
Oh, yeah, we work it different.

41:43.292 --> 41:44.954
- I just said.
- And I agreed.

41:45.044 --> 41:47.377
That's why I'm where I'm at,
and you...

41:47.463 --> 41:48.704
What?

41:49.090 --> 41:50.422
Me, what?

41:51.342 --> 41:52.753
You're you.

41:54.595 --> 41:56.587
- Pull over.
- What?

41:56.681 --> 41:57.762
Stop the fucking car.

41:57.849 --> 41:59.135
What are you, a prom queen?

41:59.225 --> 42:01.683
I hurt your feelings,
you're just gonna storm off?

42:04.063 --> 42:07.306
Are you fucking kidding me?
This kindergarten shit?

42:07.400 --> 42:08.585
Where do you think you're going?

42:08.609 --> 42:10.726
I don't care so much
about my timecard.

42:10.820 --> 42:12.027
I'm working.

42:16.784 --> 42:19.071
People see your black ass
skulking around,

42:19.162 --> 42:20.903
you're gonna get yourself shot.

42:23.624 --> 42:24.990
Prick.

43:08.169 --> 43:09.376
Tommy Purses.

43:10.671 --> 43:12.003
The fuck you doing here?

43:12.298 --> 43:13.584
Smart mouth.

43:14.383 --> 43:16.966
For a smart guy, you're awful sloppy.

43:17.345 --> 43:19.177
Same place you used to
come to slam meth

43:19.263 --> 43:21.300
when you weren't leeching off of us.

43:22.517 --> 43:25.601
Don't really feel like
catching up just now, Tommy.

43:34.612 --> 43:36.899
Hey, you know,
there's a rest stop up the road.

43:36.989 --> 43:40.278
Saw a glory hole in the back stall,
if you need something to do.

43:45.832 --> 43:47.039
Heard you're wanting a payout.

43:47.250 --> 43:49.450
Let's pretend each of these bullets
is a thousand bucks.

43:50.336 --> 43:53.295
Hold on now, Tom. Now,
you ain't got no problem with me.

43:53.381 --> 43:55.901
Look, I know we ain't been buddies,
but you got no call for this here.

43:55.925 --> 43:57.445
You know something,
you son of a bitch!

43:57.510 --> 43:59.968
What is it?
What are you selling the cops?

44:00.263 --> 44:01.845
Just point that gun down now, Tom.

44:01.931 --> 44:04.218
Please.
You're making me real nervous here.

44:05.810 --> 44:08.518
You been drinking, man?
I thought you quit that.

44:08.604 --> 44:10.971
- What do you know?
- Nothing! Just nothing!

44:11.065 --> 44:13.432
- Bullshit!
- Okay, hold on, hold on.

44:13.526 --> 44:17.019
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I'll tell you. I'll tell you.

44:18.072 --> 44:19.108
Hold on.

44:39.510 --> 44:40.967
Get up, motherfucker.

44:46.225 --> 44:47.932
I'm gonna shoot your dick off.

44:48.311 --> 44:51.054
And then your knees,
and then maybe your ears...

44:51.147 --> 44:52.747
What the fuck are you
talking about, man?

44:52.815 --> 44:55.649
Julie! When you were staying
in Will's room,

44:55.985 --> 44:57.396
you were spying on her.

44:57.486 --> 45:00.570
Made a peephole in Will's closet,
so you could watch her get dressed.

45:00.656 --> 45:02.363
I never... I would never...

45:02.450 --> 45:04.237
I don't know
what you're talking about.

45:04.327 --> 45:07.411
I'll figure out where to put
the last bullet when I get there.

45:07.496 --> 45:09.863
God damn it, listen to me.
Listen to me!

45:14.837 --> 45:17.671
I don't know nothing
about no peephole.

45:17.924 --> 45:21.088
All right?
I'd never do nothing like that.

45:21.802 --> 45:23.964
- Julie? She was...
- Where is she?

45:24.055 --> 45:25.717
- I don't know!
- Where's my daughter?

45:25.806 --> 45:28.264
- I don't know!
- You lying motherfucker!

45:28.351 --> 45:31.344
You ever ask yourself
where Lucy got the money to run off?

45:31.646 --> 45:35.640
Or what she was living off for all
them eight years before she died? Hmm?

45:35.733 --> 45:37.565
Say what you're saying, God damn it!

45:37.652 --> 45:41.521
I'm saying,
I know who was paying her.

45:41.739 --> 45:43.947
Listen, man,
I know who was paying her

45:44.033 --> 45:46.571
and who would have a problem
if she asked for more.

45:46.661 --> 45:48.323
That's all I was gonna
give the cops, man.

45:48.412 --> 45:50.904
That's all I was gonna give the cops.
A name. Shit.

45:50.998 --> 45:52.534
Just a man's name.

45:56.045 --> 45:57.832
All right, you dumbshit.

45:59.465 --> 46:01.923
Give me a reason not to murder you.

48:06.217 --> 48:07.458
<i>They were passing notes.</i>

48:11.847 --> 48:13.008
Little notes with the kids.

48:14.225 --> 48:17.593
The hole in the wall,
that's what it was for.

48:19.188 --> 48:21.271
That's right. That's correct.

48:23.901 --> 48:25.858
Yeah, that director woman.

48:28.030 --> 48:30.864
She mentioned Harris James. Again.

48:33.828 --> 48:36.445
Are you sure you know
what you're doing with her?

48:37.373 --> 48:40.036
Well, if I don't...

48:41.585 --> 48:43.201
What'd O'Brien tell us?

48:44.296 --> 48:46.413
"I'm just a sick man."

48:50.428 --> 48:53.921
I got a list of the names, addresses.

48:54.557 --> 48:57.721
A former domestic, Hoyt's house.

48:58.227 --> 49:00.184
Harris James' widow.

49:00.771 --> 49:03.229
What you think we're gonna do?

49:09.697 --> 49:11.279
Take a leak.

50:01.499 --> 50:02.706
Roland?

50:06.921 --> 50:08.207
Hey, man.

50:13.469 --> 50:14.926
How you doing?

50:16.555 --> 50:17.841
Good, man.

50:18.682 --> 50:20.173
How you doing?

50:22.770 --> 50:24.136
All right.

50:25.814 --> 50:27.146
All right.

50:28.651 --> 50:31.689
You been spending a lot of time
in here, I guess.

50:32.363 --> 50:34.480
I don't think I sleep much.

50:42.039 --> 50:43.530
What?

50:43.791 --> 50:44.998
Do me a favor.

50:46.418 --> 50:47.784
Go to the window.

50:48.671 --> 50:52.961
See if there's a dark sedan
idling down the street.

50:54.343 --> 50:55.925
Okay.

51:11.819 --> 51:13.276
No, man.

51:14.405 --> 51:15.896
Nothing out there.

51:21.495 --> 51:22.952
All right.

51:24.707 --> 51:26.790
You been seeing a car?

51:30.212 --> 51:32.295
How you been, Roland?

51:33.340 --> 51:34.956
Been doing some reading.

51:35.301 --> 51:37.133
Oh. Yeah.

51:38.429 --> 51:40.261
I never read it all the way.

51:41.056 --> 51:42.638
She never minded.

51:43.767 --> 51:45.224
Good-looking woman.

51:46.645 --> 51:48.181
That she was.

51:52.359 --> 51:53.566
Yeah.

51:56.572 --> 51:58.529
It's 2015, isn't it?

52:00.451 --> 52:01.987
That's right, pal.

52:05.039 --> 52:06.405
<i>"A lost child is a void</i>

52:06.999 --> 52:09.912
<i>"that echoes backwards
and forwards in time.</i>

52:10.794 --> 52:13.832
"It encompasses not just
the rooms you were in with them

52:13.964 --> 52:15.546
"and are no longer,

52:16.467 --> 52:19.960
"or even those rooms
you will never enter together.

52:20.971 --> 52:22.758
"The negation is deeper.

52:23.682 --> 52:26.174
"It is the knowledge
that in every room you enter

52:26.268 --> 52:27.884
"for the rest of your life,

52:28.520 --> 52:31.388
"they should be there, and are not.

52:31.774 --> 52:35.484
"And your memories of them
become totems to that absence.

52:36.904 --> 52:38.440
"A lost child

52:39.156 --> 52:42.866
"is a story
that's never allowed to end."

52:48.040 --> 52:50.248
Mrs. Hays will answer
a few questions,

52:50.334 --> 52:53.293
and afterward
she'll be signing copies right here.

52:53.379 --> 52:54.711
Thank you.

52:55.255 --> 52:57.121
Are there any questions?

52:57.508 --> 52:58.624
They saying

53:00.219 --> 53:02.085
the girl alive now?

53:03.263 --> 53:05.425
There were fingerprints
found recently, yes.

53:06.308 --> 53:09.642
I'm writing about
the new investigation now.

53:10.896 --> 53:14.389
You got any idea where she is?

53:16.819 --> 53:18.435
Do they?

53:20.280 --> 53:22.943
Uh, no. Nobody does.

53:25.202 --> 53:27.694
- Are you...
- And what about your book?

53:29.498 --> 53:31.330
You got any theory here?

53:31.417 --> 53:34.706
You got some idea
about where she's at?

53:35.879 --> 53:37.245
Well, this...

53:38.507 --> 53:41.170
I wrote it
when she was believed dead.

53:41.260 --> 53:44.378
So, you don't know nothing?
You just...

53:45.973 --> 53:49.307
You're just making your money
and milking their pain.

53:49.393 --> 53:50.829
Sir, the author has never claimed...

53:50.853 --> 53:52.344
Shame on you, woman!

54:07.411 --> 54:08.572
Dolls.

56:44.776 --> 56:46.312
The hell?

56:48.405 --> 56:49.737
Julie?
