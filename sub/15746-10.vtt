17:59.200 --> 18:01.430
IS AN ELECTROMAGNETIC
PULSE GENERATOR.

18:01.500 --> 18:04.100
NOW, IF WE CAN GET TO IT
AND ACTIVATE IT,

18:04.170 --> 18:05.600
IT WOULD
TEMPORARILY KNOCK OUT

18:05.670 --> 18:07.840
ALL ELECTRIC CURRENT
IN THE VICINITY.

18:07.900 --> 18:11.370
WITHOUT POWER,
SHE'S, WELL, POWERLESS.

18:11.440 --> 18:13.580
LEXI, TAKE SLAM
AND REV WITH YOU

18:13.640 --> 18:15.310
AND FOLLOW THIS
ALL THE WAY UP

18:15.380 --> 18:16.980
SO YOU CAN ACTIVATE
THE E.M.P.

18:17.050 --> 18:18.580
DUCK, YOU COME
WITH TECH AND ME

18:18.650 --> 18:20.550
AND WE'LL ENTER FROM
THE VIRTUAL TRAINER.

18:20.620 --> 18:22.150
SHE WON'T KNOW
WHAT HIT HER.

18:22.220 --> 18:24.320
SO, WHERE DO WE FIND
THIS E.M.P.

18:24.390 --> 18:25.720
AND HOW DO WE ACTIVATE IT?

18:25.790 --> 18:28.020
IT'S HIDDEN
RIGHT IN PLAIN SIGHT

18:28.090 --> 18:30.530
AND COMES WITH
SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS.

18:30.590 --> 18:32.700
[BEEPING]

18:32.760 --> 18:34.000
WHAT?!

18:34.060 --> 18:37.270
I THOUGHT IT WAS CATS
THAT HAD 9 LIVES.

18:39.300 --> 18:40.740
THE COAST IS CLEAR.

18:45.370 --> 18:48.010
SHE HASN'T TAMPERED
WITH THESE.

18:48.080 --> 18:49.980
[BEEPING]

18:50.050 --> 18:51.680
OH, NO!

18:51.750 --> 18:54.580
AND BY "HASN'T
TAMPERED WITH," YOU MEAN...

18:54.650 --> 18:57.990
ALL RIGHT. TIME FOR
A NEW HIGH SCORE.

18:58.050 --> 18:59.090
[GRUNTING]

18:59.150 --> 19:00.660
HA! HA!

19:00.720 --> 19:02.060
NYA!

19:02.120 --> 19:03.630
HA! HIYAH!

19:05.630 --> 19:07.760
HIYAH!

19:09.060 --> 19:11.300
HIYAH!

19:16.140 --> 19:18.440
TRY LOOKING UNDER
THE POOL TABLE.

19:18.510 --> 19:20.210
CHALK ONE UP FOR TECH.

19:20.280 --> 19:24.050
THE E.M.P. DEVICE
IS HIDDEN HERE.

19:24.110 --> 19:25.550
[GROWLING]

19:27.080 --> 19:29.180
[SCREAMING]

19:34.460 --> 19:37.560
EASY. THIS IS
A NO-SLICING ZONE!

19:42.200 --> 19:44.870
[GRUMBLING]

19:48.070 --> 19:50.410
WE ZAP ONE
AND 2 MORE APPEAR.

19:50.470 --> 19:52.010
OH, YEAH.
COOL, ISN'T IT?

19:52.070 --> 19:53.210
IT MEANS WE'RE
GETTING CLOSE

19:53.280 --> 19:54.610
TO THE BONUS LEVEL.

19:54.680 --> 19:55.640
HIYAH!

19:55.710 --> 19:57.250
OK, THIS HAS GONE
FAR ENOUGH.

19:57.310 --> 19:58.680
IT'S TIME TO GO
HEAD-TO-HEAD.

19:58.750 --> 20:01.980
WE'LL COVER YOU.
UNH! UH!

20:03.090 --> 20:04.650
UNH!
[BEEPS]

20:05.920 --> 20:07.890
COME BACK, MALLORY!

20:09.290 --> 20:12.560
[GROWLS]

20:12.630 --> 20:15.060
I'M ALL FOR CLEANING HOUSE,
BUT THIS IS RIDICULOUS!

20:15.130 --> 20:17.570
REV, LEAD THAT BIG SUCKER
THIS WAY!

20:17.630 --> 20:19.640
OH, IF YOU HAD TOLD ME
WHEN I WOKE UP THIS MORNING

20:19.700 --> 20:21.140
THAT I WAS GONNA BAIT FOR
A RUNAWAY VACUUM CLEANER,

20:21.200 --> 20:23.510
I WOULD'VE SAID
YOU WERE JUST PLAIN NUTS!

20:24.970 --> 20:26.440
HUH!

20:27.840 --> 20:29.650
WHOA!

20:34.280 --> 20:36.250
UHH! HMM.

20:38.050 --> 20:39.360
AW.

20:39.420 --> 20:41.820
TECH SAID THEY'D COME WITH
SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS.

20:41.890 --> 20:43.830
SIMPLE, MY LUCKY FOOT.

20:43.890 --> 20:45.130
I GOT THIS.

20:45.190 --> 20:46.530
STEP ONE--ARM PRIMARY
IGNITION SEQUENCE

20:46.600 --> 20:47.860
USING STANDARD ALPHANUMERIC
CODE CALCULATIONS.

20:47.930 --> 20:50.830
STEP 2--INSERT
ELECTRON OVERDRIVE RODS--

20:50.900 --> 20:54.170
YOU'RE PROVING YOURSELF
TO BE MORE WILY

20:54.240 --> 20:56.200
THAN I EVER EXPECTED.

20:56.270 --> 20:57.670
AND YOU'RE
JUST AS TWISTED

20:57.740 --> 20:59.340
AS I EVER THOUGHT
YOU WERE.

20:59.410 --> 21:02.610
NOT TWISTED.
ENLIGHTENED.

21:02.680 --> 21:04.880
BUT THEN, YOU WERE
ALWAYS JEALOUS

21:04.950 --> 21:06.450
OF MY BRAINPOWER.

21:06.520 --> 21:09.350
IT'S NOT YOUR INTELLECT
I HAVE PROBLEMS WITH.

21:09.420 --> 21:11.090
IT'S YOUR SWOLLEN HEAD.

21:11.150 --> 21:14.420
YOU TAUGHT ME
EVERYTHING I KNOW.

21:15.690 --> 21:17.030
REMEMBER?!

21:22.330 --> 21:23.800
BUT NOT EVERYTHING
I KNOW.
