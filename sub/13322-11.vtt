00:00.690 --> 00:02.323
Previously on The Fosters:

00:02.359 --> 00:03.524
Ow! Ah!

00:03.560 --> 00:04.692
- That's a...
- Nail.

00:04.761 --> 00:07.328
It's embedded several
inches into his frontal lobe.

00:07.364 --> 00:09.597
Yeah, I'm at an increased
risk of having a seizure.

00:09.632 --> 00:10.894
Stop hitting on my girlfriend.

00:10.895 --> 00:12.730
You're about half my size
on a good day, little man.

00:12.736 --> 00:14.769
- I will break you.
- Aaron is trans.

00:14.804 --> 00:17.605
- Do you wanna date him?
- I would consider it if I weren't seeing you.

00:17.640 --> 00:19.407
Well, maybe you shouldn't be then.

00:19.442 --> 00:21.509
I want to go to Juilliard
more than anything.

00:21.544 --> 00:23.478
I got in!

00:23.513 --> 00:25.380
- So when are you taking the test?
- It's tomorrow.

00:25.415 --> 00:27.715
You know, I was kind of thinking
that you could take it for me.

00:27.751 --> 00:29.550
You've committed academic fraud.

00:29.586 --> 00:33.654
The consequence of which is no
Juilliard, no college, period.

00:33.690 --> 00:35.531
There was other DNA on the murder weapon

00:35.532 --> 00:37.132
besides Martha Johnson's and Kyle's.

00:37.194 --> 00:39.727
I am the police officer
here. Let me handle this.

00:39.763 --> 00:42.463
I'm Troy Johnson, Martha
was my grandmother.

00:42.499 --> 00:44.565
Is this something you
do now? You get high?

00:44.601 --> 00:46.801
- I'm not supposed to see you.
- I won't tell if you won't.

00:46.836 --> 00:49.637
- I took some of Jesus's ADHD pills.
- Why?

00:49.672 --> 00:51.506
- To stay focused.
- Just get in the car.

00:51.541 --> 00:54.475
No, leave me alone! I
never wanna see you again!

00:54.511 --> 00:56.477
- What did you do to her?
- Jesus!

00:58.548 --> 01:00.481
- Jesus!
- I think my sister's missing.

01:00.517 --> 01:01.449
I actually did see her.

01:01.484 --> 01:03.651
They couldn't have
gotten too much further.

01:10.493 --> 01:11.750
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:11.751 --> 01:14.365
So I just got a call from the JJC.

01:14.597 --> 01:16.731
- They got the DNA report back.
- And?

01:16.766 --> 01:19.667
- And Harvey is not a match.
- Oh.

01:19.702 --> 01:24.639
But there was more DNA on the
murder weapon, besides Kyle's.

01:24.674 --> 01:29.610
They can't ID it, but it's
from someone related to Martha.

01:29.646 --> 01:31.579
A man.

01:35.685 --> 01:38.553
- Oh, good. Thank God.
- Huh?

01:40.390 --> 01:44.325
- No, I'm glad you found her.
- Found who?

01:44.360 --> 01:46.394
- Uh-huh.
- Okay, what?

01:46.429 --> 01:48.496
Callie, what are you talking about?

01:48.531 --> 01:50.731
- Did you hear what I said?
- Yeah. I'll be right back. Mm-hmm.

01:50.767 --> 01:53.434
Right back? What...

01:53.470 --> 01:57.338
So it looks like they
found her. My sister. Um...

01:57.373 --> 01:58.639
So you can just drop me anywhere.

01:58.675 --> 02:01.742
You've been so helpful, I don't
wanna inconvenience you anymore.

02:01.778 --> 02:05.746
- You know...
- Yeah, I just wanna know one thing.

02:05.782 --> 02:10.283
Why are you so convinced
that Kyle is innocent?

02:10.320 --> 02:11.686
I'm not. I just...

02:11.721 --> 02:13.554
It seems like he
didn't get a fair trial.

02:13.590 --> 02:15.490
- Okay, yeah, but you weren't there.
- You can just...

02:15.525 --> 02:17.291
You didn't live through it.

02:17.327 --> 02:19.594
I mean, I sat in that
courtroom every single day

02:19.629 --> 02:22.296
and I heard every
single piece of evidence.

02:22.332 --> 02:23.764
- Yeah, sure. You can just...
- And I'm telling you,

02:23.800 --> 02:26.501
I'm telling you that
that kid is a monster!

02:26.536 --> 02:28.636
And that you need to let this go!

02:28.671 --> 02:30.771
- You understand?
- Okay, you need to stop the car right now.

02:30.807 --> 02:34.575
I mean, really, do you really want
to let a killer back on the streets?

02:34.611 --> 02:36.777
- Please stop the car!
- What the hell is wrong with you?

02:36.813 --> 02:38.513
Watch out!

02:39.816 --> 02:41.516
What the hell are you doing?

02:55.431 --> 02:58.366
Mom, do we really have
to do this? I'm fine.

02:58.401 --> 02:59.700
I'm sure you are,
Jesus, but you know what?

02:59.736 --> 03:01.335
You passed out when Nick hit you.

03:01.371 --> 03:02.570
All right? We're gonna
get you checked out.

03:02.605 --> 03:05.273
But this is... this is ridiculous.

03:05.308 --> 03:06.607
Humor me.

03:06.643 --> 03:10.278
- It smells in here.
- What?

03:10.313 --> 03:12.713
Why does it smell like...

03:12.749 --> 03:16.651
- Why does it smell like gas?
- Don't look at me.

03:16.686 --> 03:20.621
No. I mean, like... like
gasoline, Mom. It's awful.

03:20.657 --> 03:22.529
I don't smell gasoline, love.

03:22.530 --> 03:25.430
We're in a vehicle, so I'm
sure that it, you know...

03:25.728 --> 03:28.429
What's wrong, baby?

03:28.464 --> 03:29.680
- Ow, damn!
- What's wrong?

03:29.681 --> 03:32.489
Hey, hey, hey! Relax,
relax, relax, relax.

03:33.436 --> 03:35.336
You're okay. All right? You're okay.

03:35.371 --> 03:39.540
Hey. Just relax, sweetheart. Just relax.

03:39.576 --> 03:42.643
Just relax. What's happening? What's
going on? What's wrong with him?

03:42.679 --> 03:46.581
What's happening? Jesus!
You have to stop this!

03:46.616 --> 03:49.350
- I got it.
- Jesus, Jesus!

04:50.613 --> 04:52.446
911. What's your emergency?

04:52.482 --> 04:55.549
Um, I have to, uh...

04:55.585 --> 04:58.753
- Um, there was an accident.
- What's your location?

04:58.788 --> 05:01.422
It's, uh, off of Harbor Boulevard.

05:01.457 --> 05:04.725
Um, near the blue glass building.

05:04.761 --> 05:08.362
Hey! Hey!

05:10.533 --> 05:11.732
Ah!

05:32.622 --> 05:35.423
Hey, can I help you?

05:35.458 --> 05:38.659
Oh, yeah, sorry. Um,
that's my dad's boat.

05:38.695 --> 05:41.429
- Which one?
- I'm sorry?

05:41.464 --> 05:43.464
Which boat is your dad's?

05:43.499 --> 05:45.433
Coconut Telegraph.

05:45.468 --> 05:47.501
- So you're Jim's kid?
- Yup.

05:47.537 --> 05:49.670
It's nice to meet you. He's
told me a lot about you.

05:49.706 --> 05:53.641
Go ahead. Have fun.

05:55.812 --> 05:59.747
- That was pretty good.
- Hey, if you're polite and you smile,

05:59.782 --> 06:01.582
it's amazing what you can get away with.

06:01.617 --> 06:04.652
Yeah, when you have a smile like yours.

06:04.687 --> 06:06.520
I mean, it's not as good as mine, but...

06:08.324 --> 06:11.592
Whoa! This is amazing.

06:18.601 --> 06:20.634
Not bad, huh?

06:20.670 --> 06:22.603
This is awesome.

06:47.396 --> 06:48.729
Not bad, huh?

07:02.345 --> 07:05.176
- Hey.
- Hey. What'd you mean,

07:05.177 --> 07:06.217
"You'll be right back"?

07:06.282 --> 07:09.483
Is everything okay? Callie?

07:10.720 --> 07:15.256
Callie? What the hell is going on?

07:15.291 --> 07:17.258
You're freaking me out, please.

07:17.293 --> 07:19.426
I'm right here, Jesus, you hear me?

07:19.462 --> 07:21.328
- Can you hear me?
- Let's get him out. Stay back.

07:21.364 --> 07:23.531
- Okay, I'm right here. I'm right here.
- Here we go.

07:23.566 --> 07:25.599
Contact. All right.

07:25.635 --> 07:30.371
- Can you hear me?
- Excuse me. Here we go. Okay, clear.

07:30.406 --> 07:32.273
- All right.
- All right, what do we have?

07:32.308 --> 07:34.308
Male, 16, head trauma from a fist fight.

07:34.343 --> 07:35.609
He's been seizing for
over two minutes now.

07:35.645 --> 07:37.578
Pushed 2 milligrams Ativan, but no luck.

07:37.613 --> 07:40.514
- He had a nail in his head.
- Oh, right, uh, frontal lobe.

07:40.550 --> 07:42.383
- He had a nail in his head?
- Yes, from a nail gun.

07:42.418 --> 07:43.751
But they took it out,
he's fine, he's been fine.

07:43.820 --> 07:45.653
- Where was he hit? During the fight, ma'am?
- What?

07:45.688 --> 07:47.555
- Where was he hit?
- He was hit in the forehead.

07:48.091 --> 07:50.091
If you could head to
the waiting room, okay?

07:50.126 --> 07:52.159
- He's my son. I'm staying here.
- Please, ma'am...

07:52.195 --> 07:54.362
I'm not going anywhere! So,
please do not ask me again!

07:54.397 --> 07:57.164
- It's fine.
- One, two, three.

07:58.501 --> 08:00.334
- Grab the board. Grab the board.
- Got it.

08:00.370 --> 08:03.204
- Throw him back.
- Clear it out. Okay.

08:04.374 --> 08:06.240
- You good? Okay.
- Yeah, we're good. Go.

08:08.344 --> 08:10.144
Oxygen! Oxygen!

08:10.179 --> 08:13.214
Ma'am... You gotta get her out of
here. Get her out of here, please!

08:13.249 --> 08:15.383
We got this, go.

08:15.418 --> 08:17.952
He's gonna be fine. He's gonna be fine.

09:25.375 --> 09:29.044
- So, I noticed your hair.
- Oh, yeah.

09:29.079 --> 09:31.046
Gabby came over last night.

09:31.081 --> 09:33.281
We got in the wine...

09:33.317 --> 09:36.118
Looks good.

09:39.389 --> 09:42.524
So, uh...

09:42.559 --> 09:45.393
I think I got in...

09:45.429 --> 09:47.529
a little over my head here.

09:49.399 --> 09:52.267
I know.

09:52.302 --> 09:56.338
- I care about you so much...
- I know you do, Brandon. I know.

09:56.373 --> 10:00.108
I just feel like...

10:00.144 --> 10:02.625
I'm afraid if I stay,
I'm always gonna feel like

10:02.626 --> 10:04.456
it's my job to take
care of you and Mason.

10:05.115 --> 10:08.150
- I never asked you to do that.
- No, you're right. It's just whether or not

10:08.185 --> 10:11.086
- I go to Juilliard...
- In fact, I told you not even to get involved with me.

10:11.121 --> 10:13.522
- But you just... you had to keep...
- I know. I'm sorry.

10:13.557 --> 10:16.358
I never wanted to be the
thing that holds you back.

10:20.297 --> 10:22.497
- I'd, uh, like to help with the rent.
- No.

10:22.533 --> 10:24.566
- I can find another job.
- No. You've done enough.

10:24.601 --> 10:28.303
- I really want to help.
- No, I'm not helpless, Brandon!

10:29.406 --> 10:31.439
Okay.

10:33.410 --> 10:36.344
Would it be okay maybe if I...

10:36.380 --> 10:39.281
came over sometimes
to hang out with Mason?

10:39.316 --> 10:42.450
I don't think that's a good idea.

10:42.486 --> 10:45.453
I don't want him getting more
attached to you than he already is.

10:48.292 --> 10:52.194
Yeah. Okay.

10:52.229 --> 10:54.396
Actually, I should go check on him.

10:54.431 --> 10:56.331
He should be getting
up from his nap soon.

10:56.366 --> 10:58.567
Okay.

11:24.528 --> 11:26.361
What are you doing here?

11:34.338 --> 11:37.539
Don't worry. He's fine. He
was wide awake and talking.

11:37.574 --> 11:41.543
Complaining, actually, when
they put him in the ambulance.

11:41.578 --> 11:45.146
Mariana, why don't you text
Mom, find out where they are.

11:46.250 --> 11:49.117
- Mariana.
- Huh?

11:49.152 --> 11:53.421
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, totally, I'm just...

11:54.591 --> 11:58.193
No, she isn't.

11:58.228 --> 11:59.461
Why not? What's going on?

11:59.496 --> 12:03.131
Nothing. I just...

12:03.166 --> 12:06.534
She's been taking Jesus's ADHD meds.

12:06.570 --> 12:08.236
What?

12:11.108 --> 12:13.341
- Mama.
- Don't "Mama" me.

12:13.377 --> 12:15.310
- Why on earth...
- No, Mama.

12:18.482 --> 12:19.547
What?

12:27.291 --> 12:30.558
- Hey. Look.
- Nice!

12:35.599 --> 12:39.434
Whoa! Check it out!

12:52.249 --> 12:55.550
Oh, my God.

12:55.585 --> 12:58.386
I totally feel like this is my fault.

12:58.422 --> 13:02.157
No. I'm the one who did it.

13:02.192 --> 13:05.427
And I'm the one who made the decision.

13:06.463 --> 13:08.496
It's on me.

13:08.532 --> 13:11.333
All on me.

14:09.292 --> 14:11.845
I mean, why else would
Troy show up at BayFest?

14:12.246 --> 14:13.646
To get me in his car.

14:14.217 --> 14:16.151
No, he has something to hide
and he wants me to shut up.

14:16.186 --> 14:19.254
Maybe. But Callie, things
aren't always what they seem.

14:19.289 --> 14:21.456
Okay? Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

14:21.491 --> 14:24.459
Hey, you okay?

14:24.494 --> 14:28.129
Yeah, I'm just a little sore
from the accident. But I'm fine.

14:28.165 --> 14:32.467
You should probably go to the
police, give them a statement.

14:32.502 --> 14:37.072
It's the right thing to do.
And you've done nothing wrong.

14:37.140 --> 14:39.030
Just don't say anything about Troy

14:39.031 --> 14:41.031
and the murder and the DNA evidence.

14:41.311 --> 14:43.260
It'll make you sound crazy, and

14:43.261 --> 14:45.831
it could get us both
in a lot of trouble.

14:48.085 --> 14:50.485
Okay. Um, I just wanna
talk to my mom first.

14:50.520 --> 14:52.053
Yeah. Of course.

14:58.161 --> 15:01.062
Hey, did you find Mariana?

15:01.098 --> 15:03.131
Okay, good.

15:05.068 --> 15:07.135
Wait, what about Jesus?

15:11.041 --> 15:12.974
Oh, my God.

15:16.612 --> 15:18.478
So?

15:18.514 --> 15:20.480
Hey. Um...

15:20.516 --> 15:23.550
He was doing fine, and then he
had some kind of a long seizure.

15:23.585 --> 15:26.887
And he's still unconscious.
But they're running blood tests

15:26.922 --> 15:29.957
and CAT scans and EEGs or
whatever they're called.

15:29.992 --> 15:32.926
They think that the nail in his
head was what caused the seizures,

15:32.962 --> 15:36.763
and that perhaps the injury
compromised the brain somehow.

15:36.799 --> 15:38.799
But he's gonna be okay, right?

15:38.834 --> 15:41.668
Honey, he's young and he's strong.
They're doing everything they can.

15:41.704 --> 15:42.936
He's gonna be all right. I know it.

15:44.640 --> 15:46.840
Are you Jesus Adams Fosters' parents?

15:46.875 --> 15:48.909
- Yes.
- Yes?

15:48.944 --> 15:51.745
- I'd like to ask him a few questions.
- About what?

15:51.780 --> 15:55.782
- The assault of Nick Stratos.
- Assault?

15:55.818 --> 15:59.553
No, I'm sorry. That's insane. Nick
Stratos cut off his ankle bracelet.

15:59.588 --> 16:00.821
He violated his parole.

16:00.856 --> 16:02.823
That's really a separate issue.

16:02.858 --> 16:05.726
And according to both
Nick and Jesus's sister,

16:05.761 --> 16:08.562
who was there at the time,
Jesus threw the first punch.

16:08.597 --> 16:11.631
Now, if you don't mind, I just
wanna ask him a couple of questions.

16:11.667 --> 16:13.567
Wait, no, that's not what I said.

16:13.602 --> 16:15.469
- And you are?
- His sister.

16:15.504 --> 16:16.737
Well, according to the
officers at the scene,

16:16.772 --> 16:18.772
- you and the victim...
- The victim?

16:18.807 --> 16:20.874
Nick Stratos the vic... ? No, no, no.

16:20.909 --> 16:23.870
Okay, this young man
was stalking my daughter.

16:23.871 --> 16:24.871
He broke into our house.

16:24.873 --> 16:27.547
- He was arrested...
- Whoa, okay, okay, okay. Look.

16:27.583 --> 16:29.850
But according to your daughter, she
and Nick were sitting on the grass

16:29.885 --> 16:32.586
when your son jumped out of
the car and started swinging.

16:32.621 --> 16:34.888
- Mariana?
- No, that's not...

16:34.923 --> 16:37.557
Jesus thought that
Nick was gonna hurt me.

16:37.593 --> 16:39.926
- So we just wanna talk with him.
- Okay, well, he's unconscious right now,

16:39.962 --> 16:41.728
so he's not gonna be very helpful.

16:41.764 --> 16:44.931
Excuse me, I just wanna let you know
that your son's awake and talking.

16:44.967 --> 16:47.701
I can take one of you to see him now.

16:47.736 --> 16:48.869
Fine. Then I'm gonna go with you.

16:48.904 --> 16:50.837
Because I'm a cop too.

16:50.873 --> 16:53.607
And no one questions my son
without me being present.

16:53.642 --> 16:55.742
- It's just a few questions.
- Great. Then it won't take long.

16:55.778 --> 16:56.977
- Okay?
- Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

16:58.947 --> 17:01.815
Um, have you heard from Brandon or Jude?

17:01.850 --> 17:03.865
Um, no. Let me try and get
a hold of them now. Okay?

17:03.866 --> 17:04.866
Thank you.

17:59.875 --> 18:03.677
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me. Where are you?

18:06.915 --> 18:10.717
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:10.752 --> 18:12.719
Are you all right? What happened?

18:12.754 --> 18:16.756
Mariana. Mariana. You
need to come with me.

18:16.792 --> 18:18.758
Huh? Why? Mat just got here.

18:18.794 --> 18:20.894
Because I'm having you checked
out by a doctor, that's why.

18:20.929 --> 18:23.930
Mat will still be here
when you get back. Come on.

18:30.939 --> 18:34.741
- Why's she, um...
- You'll have to ask her.

18:42.751 --> 18:47.721
Mm! Oh, my God.

18:47.756 --> 18:51.691
Like, why are potato chips

18:51.727 --> 18:54.961
like the most delicious thing ever
created in the history of the world?

18:54.997 --> 19:00.867
Like, why do we ever need
to eat something else?

19:00.903 --> 19:04.571
Wait.

19:04.606 --> 19:07.541
What if we, like, invented a potato chip

19:07.576 --> 19:09.843
that would give you all
the nutrition and nutrients

19:09.878 --> 19:12.546
and vitamins that you needed every day.

19:12.581 --> 19:15.482
Then you wouldn't have
to eat anything else.

19:41.577 --> 19:42.943
- You sure you wanna... ?
- Yeah.

19:51.853 --> 19:54.654
- Oh, God, what are we gonna do?
- Um...

19:55.757 --> 19:59.526
So you didn't throw the first punch?

19:59.561 --> 20:02.529
Uh, no, I did, but it was...

20:02.564 --> 20:04.598
Because according to him,
you were the aggressor.

20:04.633 --> 20:07.901
And your sister is corroborating
Mr. Stratos' version of events.

20:07.936 --> 20:10.670
My sister? Like, Mariana? What...

20:10.706 --> 20:14.741
Dude, why are you...
He was gonna hurt her!

20:14.776 --> 20:16.977
- It's the only reason I did...
- You need to calm down.

20:17.012 --> 20:20.118
- You calm down! No!
- She said she was in no danger

20:20.119 --> 20:20.919
when you showed up.

20:20.982 --> 20:24.918
Well, that's bull! That is a
complete load of bull! Like...

20:24.953 --> 20:26.987
Why does it smell so terrible in here?

20:27.022 --> 20:31.625
- What, baby?
- Why does it smell like gasoline in a hospital?

20:31.660 --> 20:32.813
Okay, you need to get out of here.

20:32.814 --> 20:34.175
I need a doctor!
Please, I need a doctor!

20:34.230 --> 20:37.697
He's seizing again! Please,
I need a doctor, somebody!

20:39.001 --> 20:40.999
Hey, it's Jude. You know what to do.

20:41.270 --> 20:43.003
Jude, it's Brandon. Where are you?

20:43.039 --> 20:44.238
How about you pick
up the phone sometime?

20:44.273 --> 20:46.106
We gotta get to the
hospital, Jesus got hurt.

20:46.142 --> 20:48.008
Call me as soon as you get this.

20:48.044 --> 20:52.046
- We'll find him.
- Where is he?

20:54.050 --> 20:57.051
Should we, like, maybe, like,
hide in the closet or something?

21:10.032 --> 21:11.899
Um, I don't think hiding's gonna work.

21:11.934 --> 21:14.068
Go! Go!

21:17.239 --> 21:20.874
Nice shorts!

21:31.887 --> 21:35.823
- Hey, what's going on?
- The boat's sinking! The boat is sinking!

21:35.858 --> 21:38.993
- Hey, Jim! What's going on?
- Go, go, go!

21:39.028 --> 21:42.062
- I don't know! Gonna pull over!
- Are you all right over there?

21:42.098 --> 21:43.097
Let me look!

21:45.001 --> 21:46.750
Billy, we got a couple of kids

21:46.751 --> 21:48.400
broke into a boat or
something. I'm going after 'em.

21:50.039 --> 21:53.073
This is ridiculous.

21:53.109 --> 21:55.142
Wait, stop!

21:55.177 --> 21:57.177
Stop, stop! Jude! Over here!

21:57.213 --> 22:00.814
Go, go, go! Get in!
Get in! Get in! Get in!

22:00.850 --> 22:02.249
- Hey!
- Go! Go, go, go! Drive, drive!

22:02.284 --> 22:05.019
- What is going on?
- That! Go!

22:05.054 --> 22:06.053
- Drive!
- Okay, okay.

22:06.088 --> 22:08.989
Go!

22:09.025 --> 22:11.091
I don't even wanna know. Okay?

22:11.127 --> 22:13.060
Dude, that was awesome!

22:13.095 --> 22:14.962
So how long has this been going on?

22:14.997 --> 22:18.132
Not long.

22:18.167 --> 22:21.268
Is this why your brother's
pills went missing from the mail?

22:21.303 --> 22:25.239
Of course it is.

22:25.274 --> 22:28.142
- And how many did you take?
- Can I see your...

22:28.177 --> 22:30.811
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

22:30.846 --> 22:33.113
- A few.
- What does "a few" mean?

22:33.149 --> 22:37.284
- Like, two or three.
- Well, two or three? Which is it?

22:37.319 --> 22:40.187
Three.

22:40.222 --> 22:44.191
And I only did it because I
was falling behind in school

22:44.226 --> 22:47.227
and I hadn't been sleeping,
and I won't do it again, okay?

22:47.263 --> 22:49.997
You're damn right you're
not gonna do it again.

22:51.233 --> 22:53.901
You're sure it was just a few? Really?

22:55.237 --> 23:00.207
Her blood pressure's a little
high and she's very dehydrated,

23:00.242 --> 23:03.777
but she doesn't seem too badly off.

23:03.813 --> 23:05.946
You're lucky.

23:06.982 --> 23:08.949
- Is that it?
- For me.

23:08.984 --> 23:11.251
Just gonna send the phlebotomist
in to take your blood.

23:11.287 --> 23:15.956
And that should tell us a
lot more. He'll be right in.

23:24.300 --> 23:26.166
- Excuse me.
- Mm-hmm?

23:26.202 --> 23:31.105
Um, do you know if anyone's been
brought in from a car accident?

23:31.140 --> 23:32.840
Off of Harbor Boulevard?

23:32.875 --> 23:36.276
- Are you family?
- No.

23:36.312 --> 23:39.113
I can't tell you anything,
then. Sorry, sweetheart.

23:45.020 --> 23:46.153
Well?

23:49.325 --> 23:54.094
I just hope they're okay,
the people in the other car.

23:55.931 --> 23:57.931
Maybe the police will be
able to tell you something

23:57.967 --> 23:59.800
when you give 'em your statement.

24:01.203 --> 24:04.004
Okay, so I've been thinking.

24:04.039 --> 24:07.141
Troy might not have even
told them that I was there.

24:07.176 --> 24:09.209
At the accident, I mean.

24:09.245 --> 24:11.145
No, think about it.

24:11.180 --> 24:12.946
If he really does
have something to hide,

24:12.982 --> 24:15.115
then the last thing he'd
wanna do is draw attention

24:15.151 --> 24:16.785
to himself and have me saying that

24:16.786 --> 24:18.316
he wouldn't let me
out of his car, right?

24:19.255 --> 24:23.857
Maybe. But that's a big risk, Callie.

24:23.893 --> 24:27.027
I really think you
need to tell your mom.

24:31.000 --> 24:35.068
He cut off his ankle bracelet
and just showed up at BayFest?

24:35.104 --> 24:38.272
How'd he even know you were there?

24:38.307 --> 24:42.943
I don't know. Jesus must
have told him, I guess.

24:42.978 --> 24:44.144
Why would he do that?

24:46.081 --> 24:47.281
Did he hurt you or something?

24:47.316 --> 24:49.983
Is that why your mom
wanted you to see a doctor?

24:52.888 --> 24:55.923
They found out that I was
taking Jesus's ADHD pills.

24:55.958 --> 24:58.125
What?

24:58.160 --> 25:00.761
You were taking his pills? Why?

25:02.932 --> 25:05.199
Just stupid, I guess.

25:10.239 --> 25:13.006
- Thanks for taking Noah home.
- Mm-hmm. No worries.

25:13.042 --> 25:15.209
- Okay, I'll text you later.
- Okay, bye.

25:15.244 --> 25:16.877
Bye.

25:20.149 --> 25:22.015
Hope Jesus is okay.

25:28.123 --> 25:31.091
Hey, thanks for this.
Okay, I'll call you later.

25:39.268 --> 25:40.440
His brain is swelling,

25:40.441 --> 25:42.641
so we have to relieve
the pressure right away.

25:43.038 --> 25:45.973
We're gonna put Jesus into
a medically-induced coma,

25:46.008 --> 25:50.811
and then insert a bolt into his
skull which will monitor the pressure

25:50.846 --> 25:52.279
and let us know if we need
to take any other action.

25:52.314 --> 25:55.115
I'm sorry, you're gonna
put a bolt into his head?

25:55.150 --> 25:58.051
We have to. If the swelling continues,

25:58.087 --> 26:00.787
it can press down on the spinal column

26:00.823 --> 26:03.891
severing the connection between
the two, which could be fatal.

26:03.926 --> 26:07.861
- Oh, my God.
- But this is gonna relieve that, right?

26:07.897 --> 26:10.230
Not exactly. It'll monitor the pressure

26:10.266 --> 26:14.034
and let us know if we need
to drain fluid from the brain.

26:14.069 --> 26:17.170
And if this doesn't work, we
can always do a craniotomy,

26:17.206 --> 26:19.260
where we remove a piece of the skull

26:19.261 --> 26:21.740
and allow the brain room to expand.

26:21.744 --> 26:24.211
But we hope that won't be necessary.

26:24.246 --> 26:27.080
Okay. How long until
we know if it worked?

26:27.116 --> 26:29.983
Hours, days, weeks.

26:30.019 --> 26:32.219
Nurse, we're ready. We just don't know.

26:32.254 --> 26:35.889
Okay. Love you, baby. Love you.

26:35.925 --> 26:37.224
We love you, baby.

26:43.132 --> 26:44.865
Okay?

26:44.900 --> 26:46.199
He's gonna be okay.

28:20.732 --> 28:23.400
I wanna...

28:23.435 --> 28:25.435
I need to go pray.

28:25.470 --> 28:28.638
I know you don't want to, but I need to.

28:30.742 --> 28:32.642
That's fine, love.

28:34.446 --> 28:35.612
Okay.

28:44.690 --> 28:47.457
- Hey.
- You left this in my car.

28:47.492 --> 28:50.594
Oh. Thanks.

28:50.629 --> 28:54.798
- Can we talk for a second?
- Yeah.

29:00.672 --> 29:05.308
Listen, I think today
was kind of a mistake.

29:05.344 --> 29:06.543
A big one.

29:08.447 --> 29:11.648
- Uh, okay.
- I mean, nothing's changed.

29:13.452 --> 29:15.518
That's not true.

29:15.554 --> 29:17.654
I mean, everything has changed.

29:17.689 --> 29:22.425
Yeah, well, first of all, I kinda
feel like I'm your back-up plan

29:22.461 --> 29:24.594
or consolation prize or whatever.

29:24.630 --> 29:27.697
- You're not...
- You hurt me, Brandon.

29:27.733 --> 29:31.601
And I told you over and over that
you shouldn't get involved with me,

29:31.637 --> 29:34.671
that I had a kid, that it was
too much for you to take on.

29:34.706 --> 29:36.870
But no matter how many times I said it,

29:36.871 --> 29:38.271
you came back and you said,

29:38.477 --> 29:41.411
"No, I want this, I
can do this, I mean it."

29:41.446 --> 29:45.448
But I was right, you couldn't.

29:45.484 --> 29:48.685
So you hurt me and you hurt Mason.

29:48.720 --> 29:50.687
And I'm never getting over that.

29:50.722 --> 29:52.422
I gotta go.

30:14.680 --> 30:17.380
I think I'm just gonna wait out here.

30:17.416 --> 30:19.382
What? Why?

30:19.418 --> 30:21.718
I don't think Callie's really
gonna wanna see me right now.

30:21.753 --> 30:24.521
Why, what happened?

30:24.556 --> 30:27.791
We got into a fight. Or we
broke up, I'm not really sure.

30:27.826 --> 30:29.793
Wow. Must have been one hell of a fight.

30:29.828 --> 30:33.563
What was it about?

30:33.598 --> 30:36.700
That dude Aaron you
were asking me about.

30:37.903 --> 30:41.438
- Is something going on with them?
- No.

30:41.473 --> 30:43.573
I don't think so. But...

30:43.608 --> 30:45.875
She said if she wasn't
going out with me,

30:45.911 --> 30:47.811
she would consider going out with him.

30:49.548 --> 30:51.548
I see.

30:51.583 --> 30:53.616
But she is going out with you.

30:53.652 --> 30:56.519
So?

30:56.555 --> 30:59.489
Well, she said she'd consider it
if she wasn't going out with you.

30:59.524 --> 31:01.097
- But she is.
- And?

31:01.098 --> 31:03.298
That's still a really mean
thing to say to somebody.

31:03.428 --> 31:06.730
I don't know how mean it is.

31:06.765 --> 31:09.666
Okay. I mean, dumb, yeah.

31:09.701 --> 31:12.602
But don't you think maybe
you overreacted a little bit?

31:14.543 --> 31:17.844
I mean, if Ana broke up with me
every time I said something stupid,

31:17.879 --> 31:19.879
we'd need a revolving
door at my apartment.

31:21.650 --> 31:22.682
Come on.

31:28.757 --> 31:30.623
Hey. Are you okay?

31:30.659 --> 31:33.793
What was that about?

31:35.730 --> 31:37.564
We broke up.

31:37.599 --> 31:40.934
I thought you already broke
up 'cause of Juilliard.

31:43.672 --> 31:45.538
It turns out I'm not going.

31:45.574 --> 31:47.807
You're kidding. Why not?

31:49.511 --> 31:51.978
It's a long story. Um...

31:52.013 --> 31:57.417
I took the SAT for someone because
Cort and I needed the money,

31:57.452 --> 31:59.419
and I got caught.

31:59.454 --> 32:02.856
Oh, my God, Brandon.

32:02.891 --> 32:07.727
Don't tell anyone yet, okay? Mama
knows, but I haven't told Mom.

32:07.762 --> 32:10.630
And I don't know how
I'm supposed to now.

32:11.733 --> 32:12.832
Yeah.

32:18.773 --> 32:20.506
- I'll be back.
- Mm-hmm.

32:24.613 --> 32:26.579
- I'm sorry.
- Me too.

32:26.615 --> 32:28.715
I'm sorry!

32:28.750 --> 32:30.650
I never should have said
that. That's not what I meant.

32:30.685 --> 32:33.720
I know. Me neither. I just...
I was being stupid and jealous.

32:33.755 --> 32:35.788
- What I was trying to say...
- It doesn't matter.

32:35.824 --> 32:37.015
No, it does matter.

32:37.016 --> 32:39.216
'Cause I never wanna make
you feel like that. Okay?

32:44.900 --> 32:47.934
He just picked me up and
is dropping me off, okay?

32:47.969 --> 32:48.935
It's not...

32:51.606 --> 32:54.641
I know. I know, I just...

32:55.744 --> 32:57.610
I should probably go talk to him.

32:59.748 --> 33:01.447
To apologize.

33:05.921 --> 33:10.623
I just came to check on everyone
before I had to go in to work.

33:10.659 --> 33:14.460
- Where's your moms?
- Uh, they're back with Jesus.

33:14.496 --> 33:17.530
I got everybody's stuff.

33:17.565 --> 33:20.833
I broke down the booth at the
festival, I figured I'd just...

33:20.869 --> 33:22.735
take the rest of it home for now, huh?

33:22.771 --> 33:25.438
Yeah. That was nice of you, Dad. Thanks.

33:25.473 --> 33:29.509
I, uh... I got you something.

33:29.544 --> 33:31.778
I was gonna give it
to you earlier, but...

33:33.882 --> 33:37.717
I found it in a bookstore
about a year ago.

33:37.752 --> 33:39.090
I, uh, turned down a
few pages of cool stuff

33:39.091 --> 33:41.091
we could do when I come visit.

33:42.356 --> 33:45.825
Uh, you bought this a year ago?

33:45.860 --> 33:47.860
How'd you know I was gonna get in?

33:47.896 --> 33:51.798
I just did. I'm so proud of you.

33:58.840 --> 34:02.675
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

34:02.711 --> 34:06.512
- I'm sorry about today.
- Oh, uh, it's cool.

34:06.548 --> 34:08.581
I probably shouldn't have
said all those things.

34:08.616 --> 34:11.583
Yeah, you probably shouldn't have.

34:11.619 --> 34:14.420
And I definitely shouldn't have
made that crack about your size.

34:15.724 --> 34:19.525
To be fair, I didn't
know you were trans, so...

34:19.561 --> 34:21.561
I just mean that if I'd have known,

34:21.596 --> 34:23.496
I never would have said those things.

34:23.531 --> 34:26.498
When Callie told me, I felt like an ass.

34:28.469 --> 34:30.902
Anyway, I'm sorry.

34:30.938 --> 34:33.840
- We good?
- Yeah. Yeah. We're good.

34:33.875 --> 34:35.574
All right.

34:44.585 --> 34:47.239
I know you're only supposed
to give me things I can handle,

34:47.241 --> 34:48.341
but I can't handle this.

34:53.495 --> 34:57.430
Don't you dare take my
son. Do you understand?

34:57.465 --> 34:59.432
Don't you dare.

35:25.794 --> 35:29.629
Hey. He's gonna be okay.

35:29.664 --> 35:32.765
- How do you know?
- What?

35:32.801 --> 35:34.734
How do you know that he's gonna be okay?

35:35.870 --> 35:39.839
He wouldn't have even...

35:39.874 --> 35:41.908
He wouldn't even be here
if it wasn't for you.

35:43.745 --> 35:45.812
- But I was just...
- You were just what?

35:45.847 --> 35:47.814
You were just seeing Nick all the time?

35:47.849 --> 35:49.582
You were just lying
to everybody about it?

35:49.617 --> 35:51.918
You were just making your
brother keep all your secrets?

35:52.033 --> 35:56.002
All he ever did was try to protect
you, and now look where it got him.

36:03.578 --> 36:06.913
What did she mean, you've
been seeing Nick all this time?

36:08.616 --> 36:09.649
Uh...

36:12.404 --> 36:15.690
- Hey. I'm gonna take off.
- Okay.

36:16.178 --> 36:19.112
- Unless you want me to...
- No. That's okay.

36:19.147 --> 36:21.414
- If you wanna go, that's fine.
- Okay.

36:21.450 --> 36:26.152
- I'll, uh, check in with you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

36:26.188 --> 36:28.421
Um, actually, listen.

36:30.092 --> 36:33.326
You can't go around telling
people that I'm trans.

36:35.163 --> 36:37.197
Okay. Sure. Sorry.

36:37.232 --> 36:40.166
It's just not your story to tell.

36:40.202 --> 36:42.402
Got it. Of course.

36:42.437 --> 36:45.071
People literally get
killed for being trans,

36:45.107 --> 36:47.373
so it's a really vulnerable
thing to share with someone.

36:49.377 --> 36:51.111
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

36:51.146 --> 36:53.513
It's okay. I just had to say something.

36:53.548 --> 36:55.381
No, I'm glad you did.

36:55.417 --> 36:58.218
Um...

36:58.253 --> 37:00.153
- Let me know what happens with Jesus?
- Yeah.

37:00.188 --> 37:03.256
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye. Sorry.

37:03.291 --> 37:05.240
Two people inside this hospital

37:05.241 --> 37:07.230
are fighting for their lives
after a hit and run crash

37:07.234 --> 37:09.996
that happened over on Harbor
Boulevard this afternoon.

37:10.031 --> 37:11.900
The only witness who
drove past the scene

37:11.901 --> 37:13.101
reported a Caucasian male,

37:13.201 --> 37:16.536
approximately 30 years old,
driving away in an older blue sedan.

37:16.571 --> 37:19.405
Police are asking anyone with
information to come forward.

37:19.441 --> 37:22.175
We've put a tipline number
at the bottom of your screen.

37:22.210 --> 37:23.820
We're now reporting at
St. Michael's Hospital,

37:23.821 --> 37:25.121
this is John Nichols.

37:39.528 --> 37:41.060
Hey.

37:41.096 --> 37:42.195
Guys.

37:43.231 --> 37:46.065
So he made it through the surgery.

37:46.101 --> 37:49.235
And the doctor said that he
did as well as could be hoped.

37:49.271 --> 37:52.138
Where is he? Can we see him?

37:52.174 --> 37:56.042
Uh, not right now, honey.
He's still in the ICU.

37:56.077 --> 38:00.446
And... and it could be a few
days before the swelling...

38:00.482 --> 38:03.316
Okay, baby. Please, sit. Sit.

38:03.351 --> 38:06.286
Okay, guys, there's nothing else
for us to do right now but wait.

38:06.321 --> 38:09.155
That's all we can do, so I think
it important that you guys go home,

38:09.191 --> 38:11.224
get some rest. Okay?

38:11.259 --> 38:13.059
No. No, I wanna stay.

38:13.094 --> 38:14.530
Sweetheart, you can't see him anyway.

38:14.531 --> 38:16.131
There's no visitors in the ICU.

38:16.231 --> 38:20.333
And you need to get
some sleep, young lady.

38:20.368 --> 38:21.567
- You all do.
- Yeah.

38:23.405 --> 38:25.505
Okay, well, pack it
up. And listen, please,

38:25.540 --> 38:29.175
please, please, for the
love of God, no more trouble.

38:29.210 --> 38:31.477
It's the last thing your Mama
and I can handle right now.

38:31.513 --> 38:36.215
Okay? Is more drama.
Our plates are full. Yes?

38:37.552 --> 38:41.287
I wanna hear you guys
say it: no more trouble.

38:41.323 --> 38:43.156
- Yes, Moms.
- Okay.

38:43.191 --> 38:44.257
Thank you.

38:44.292 --> 38:48.261
Go ahead. I love you guys.

38:48.296 --> 38:50.363
Love you.

39:20.395 --> 39:23.329
- Can I help you?
- Yes, um...

39:23.365 --> 39:25.365
I need to make a statement
about an accident.

39:25.400 --> 39:27.300
What kind of accident?

39:27.335 --> 39:29.335
A car accident.

39:29.371 --> 39:32.271
A hit and run happened this
afternoon off Harbor Boulevard.

39:32.307 --> 39:34.507
Oh. Take a seat. Someone'll
be right with you.

39:49.624 --> 39:52.392
God, I just want him off those machines.

39:56.498 --> 40:00.299
I just can't get over what the
doctor said, just that, uh...

40:02.170 --> 40:05.471
even if everything goes perfectly,

40:05.507 --> 40:07.607
there still could be...

40:07.642 --> 40:11.210
consequences to a head injury like that.

40:13.181 --> 40:18.151
Learning disabilities, having
to learn to walk and talk again.

40:20.455 --> 40:24.524
Personality changes, anger.
Just... I just want our boy back.

40:34.335 --> 40:39.505
- So what's up?
- I thought you might wanna know about this.

40:39.541 --> 40:42.408
This girl comes in to give a
statement about the hit and run

40:42.444 --> 40:45.211
on Harbor Boulevard this afternoon.

40:45.246 --> 40:47.613
Says she was a passenger
in the car that caused it.

40:47.649 --> 40:49.615
- Uh-huh.
- Next thing I know,

40:49.651 --> 40:51.617
she's talking about the
Martha Johnson murder case.

40:51.653 --> 40:54.620
That she was in the car
with Martha's grandson,

40:54.656 --> 40:57.223
he was trying to
kidnap her or something.

40:57.258 --> 41:00.393
- Are her parents with her?
- No, came in on her own.

41:00.428 --> 41:03.329
So she left the scene of an accident.

41:03.364 --> 41:07.366
- Does she know that's a felony?
- I don't think so.
