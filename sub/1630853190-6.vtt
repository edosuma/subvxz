WEBVTT

00:10.944 --> 00:12.746
Ow.

00:12.846 --> 00:15.849
Are you still feeling sorry
for yourself?

00:15.949 --> 00:18.252
You gotta shake this off.

00:18.352 --> 00:21.722
I can't. I am totally blocked
for new sketch ideas.

00:21.822 --> 00:25.693
And look at these comments.

00:25.793 --> 00:27.728
"Remember when iCarly
was funny?"

00:27.828 --> 00:32.800
It's like, words hurt,
MilkMilkLemonade69.

00:32.900 --> 00:34.568
I'm sorry, Carly.

00:34.668 --> 00:36.304
You're just in a little rut.

00:36.404 --> 00:38.072
You'll shake it off soon.

00:38.172 --> 00:40.374
Maybe by taking a shower.

00:40.474 --> 00:42.943
I know.
I should be more like you.

00:43.043 --> 00:44.578
Most people should.

00:44.678 --> 00:46.614
It's like you didn't
even notice

00:46.714 --> 00:47.948
Dutch was on that
"Worst Dressed" list.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.683
Dutch was on what?

00:53.154 --> 00:57.225
No! I styled this outfit!

00:57.325 --> 00:59.660
Aw, I lost my mojo.

00:59.760 --> 01:01.695
I'm a total failure,
and everything sucks,

01:01.795 --> 01:03.231
and nothing
will ever get better,

01:03.331 --> 01:05.599
and your thing
won't get better either!

01:11.772 --> 01:15.476
Lotta snacks in here.
Got any wine?

01:15.576 --> 01:17.378
Red or white?

01:55.416 --> 01:58.186
Carly!
Hey, are you okay?

01:58.286 --> 01:59.620
Yeah, why?

01:59.720 --> 02:01.489
You texted me,
"Come to the studio. 911."

02:01.589 --> 02:03.391
You weren't responding,
so your mom said

02:03.491 --> 02:05.025
throw 911
on a vague text.

02:05.125 --> 02:08.462
She abuses it.
She texts 911 every time

02:08.562 --> 02:09.663
Kelly Ripa's on TV.

02:09.763 --> 02:12.300
She loves her arms.

02:12.400 --> 02:13.801
I'm sorry I've been MIA.

02:13.901 --> 02:17.104
With the Kevin app, Pearl,
Millicent, Kelly Ripa...

02:17.205 --> 02:18.539
I just don't have
very much time for iCarly.

02:18.639 --> 02:19.973
Or "IRL Carly."

02:20.073 --> 02:23.043
Which is why I've come up
with something brilliant

02:23.143 --> 02:24.678
to get us out of our rut.

02:24.778 --> 02:26.647
I asked our fans to send in
ideas for what they want to

02:26.747 --> 02:28.249
- see me do on iCarly.
- Oh.

02:28.349 --> 02:30.050
Whoa, so many!

02:30.150 --> 02:31.652
All right, cool, well...
Let's delete

02:31.752 --> 02:33.621
all the ones
from Mandy Valdez...

02:33.721 --> 02:37.157
and any with the word "feet"
in the file name...

02:37.258 --> 02:39.760
And that leaves us with two.

02:40.794 --> 02:42.930
Fredward, it's your mother.

02:43.697 --> 02:45.233
I'm dying.

02:45.999 --> 02:49.069
Joy Behar is
in for Kelly Ripa today.

02:50.037 --> 02:51.205
Huh?

02:52.172 --> 02:53.707
Carly, ciao.

02:53.807 --> 02:56.844
Or, as they say in Seattle,
where I live now, hello.

02:56.944 --> 02:59.280
Oh, my God.
It's Paul.

02:59.880 --> 03:02.883
That's Paul?
Your producer from Italian QVC?

03:02.983 --> 03:04.785
Yeah. I haven't seen him
in forever.

03:04.885 --> 03:07.120
He's the best producer
that I've ever worked with.

03:08.088 --> 03:09.990
In Europe.

03:10.090 --> 03:12.125
I made the jump
from producer to manager,

03:12.226 --> 03:13.994
and I would love
to represent you.

03:14.094 --> 03:16.797
Huh. You know, I never really
thought about getting a manager,

03:16.897 --> 03:19.032
but this could be exactly
what we need right now.

03:19.132 --> 03:21.769
We've been
making iCarly for 15 years.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.136
What do we need this guy for?

03:23.237 --> 03:24.738
Now, you're
probably wondering,

03:24.838 --> 03:26.507
"What do we need
this guy for?"

03:26.607 --> 03:29.109
Oh. That was cool.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.878
Come on, that was cool.

03:30.978 --> 03:32.713
So I'm guessing
you didn't receive

03:32.813 --> 03:34.248
many useful submissions.

03:34.348 --> 03:35.983
Nowadays, people
want to drive traffic

03:36.083 --> 03:38.452
to their own platforms,
not boost yours.

03:38.552 --> 03:42.490
They are, as we used to say
in Italy, narcisista.

03:45.926 --> 03:48.562
I have so many ideas
to take your show

03:48.662 --> 03:49.663
to the next level.

03:49.763 --> 03:51.332
Nope. We do not need

03:51.432 --> 03:52.600
some rando coming in here,

03:52.700 --> 03:54.101
and telling us what to do.

03:54.201 --> 03:56.270
No. Paul is no rando.

03:56.370 --> 03:58.272
Look, he's got big clients.

03:58.372 --> 04:00.073
The Tiny Psychic.

04:00.173 --> 04:02.075
Mayor Pete.

04:02.175 --> 04:04.111
Oh, not the guy who ran
for president,

04:04.211 --> 04:06.680
a beagle named Pete
who's in charge of the town.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.519
Ah, shoot. There's a crisis
with the Kevin app.

04:11.619 --> 04:13.754
A therapy fox got
into a therapy henhouse,

04:13.854 --> 04:15.222
and you can imagine
how that went.

04:15.323 --> 04:17.224
Uh, we can talk about this
another time, okay?

04:20.160 --> 04:22.363
Aw, look at Mayor Pete
breaking ground

04:22.463 --> 04:23.731
on a new library.

04:24.698 --> 04:27.167
Oh. No, he's
just hiding a bone.

04:30.103 --> 04:32.139
If you had asked me
six months ago

04:32.239 --> 04:33.907
to design the uniforms
for your restaurant,

04:34.007 --> 04:36.477
I would've open-hand
slapped you in the face.

04:36.577 --> 04:38.679
Ooh, with rings on?

04:38.779 --> 04:41.248
Why am I excited?
I need to unpack that.

04:42.049 --> 04:43.851
But now, since
I'm a complete failure,

04:43.951 --> 04:46.320
I figured a low-stakes job
might help me

04:46.420 --> 04:47.721
get my mojo back.

04:47.821 --> 04:49.122
- You ready?
- Shh!

04:49.222 --> 04:51.559
You're not.
Jack, get out here!

04:51.659 --> 04:54.562
And show Spencer
his new server uniforms.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.435
You hate it.

05:01.535 --> 05:02.736
Hate is a strong word.

05:02.836 --> 05:05.272
- That describes how you feel?
- Yes.

05:06.239 --> 05:07.575
Can you even move your arms?

05:07.675 --> 05:08.609
Oh, I can't move anything.

05:08.709 --> 05:10.110
But can you take a picture?

05:10.210 --> 05:11.745
I feel like Rihanna.

05:11.845 --> 05:13.347
Harper, this is a disaster!

05:13.447 --> 05:15.449
Shay What is getting reviewed
by a restaurant critic

05:15.549 --> 05:18.519
for the first time tonight
and, unlike Rihanna,

05:18.619 --> 05:21.088
our servers cannot serve.

05:23.223 --> 05:24.124
Jack, you can go.

05:24.224 --> 05:25.258
Actually, I can't.

05:25.359 --> 05:27.595
Both my legs are asleep.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.164
You have to let me fix this.

05:31.264 --> 05:33.033
There's no time.
Look, I'll just stick

05:33.133 --> 05:34.735
with the old uniforms.
It's no big deal.

05:34.835 --> 05:38.372
Yes, big deal!
I'm nothing sans mojo.

05:39.740 --> 05:43.310
Your mojo is still required,
but your assignment has changed.

05:43.411 --> 05:46.079
Come sit at the bar later,
and talk about how delicious

05:46.179 --> 05:48.148
everything is, loud enough
for the critic to hear.

05:48.248 --> 05:52.152
I have always fancied myself
an actress.

05:53.120 --> 05:55.222
Mm.

05:55.322 --> 05:56.890
Delicious.

05:57.691 --> 06:00.994
My God.
Meryl could never.

06:06.233 --> 06:07.968
Freddie!

06:08.769 --> 06:10.237
Freddie?

06:11.672 --> 06:14.174
Carly?
What are you doing here?

06:14.274 --> 06:17.277
Well, you're dressed
like a chicken, so...

06:17.377 --> 06:18.779
What the cluck?

06:20.280 --> 06:21.949
The fox has been loose
for hours,

06:22.049 --> 06:24.351
and Freddie can't catch him,
so I suggested he try

06:24.452 --> 06:26.286
and trick it into thinking
he was a chicken.

06:26.386 --> 06:28.722
Obviously, I said no,
but then Pearl bit her lip

06:28.822 --> 06:31.191
in this really cute way,
like...

06:32.726 --> 06:34.662
It's cute
when she does it.

06:34.762 --> 06:35.863
Why are you here?

06:35.963 --> 06:37.731
I wanted to talk
more about Paul.

06:37.831 --> 06:39.633
- Ugh.
- You've just been so busy,

06:39.733 --> 06:41.134
and I think it might
really be helpful

06:41.234 --> 06:42.335
to have someone else
on the team.

06:42.436 --> 06:43.704
Honestly, I'd rather not.

06:43.804 --> 06:46.106
- I'm sorry.
- Oh.

06:46.206 --> 06:47.340
Shoot.

06:47.441 --> 06:48.542
I really thought
you were gonna say yes,

06:48.642 --> 06:50.377
so I'm sorry, too.

06:51.311 --> 06:52.780
Hey, anybody looking
for a fox?

06:52.880 --> 06:54.147
This guy just loves me.

06:55.348 --> 06:57.284
That was amazing.

06:58.185 --> 07:02.189
Freddie, the fox must've seen
your chicken costume.

07:05.459 --> 07:06.860
Come on.

07:08.562 --> 07:10.330
Go home, friend.

07:16.537 --> 07:18.772
Paul, this is Freddie.

07:18.872 --> 07:21.174
He's usually not
in a chicken costume.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.544
Yeah, I was gonna say,
"What the cluck?"

07:23.644 --> 07:25.746
- I just made that joke.
- 'Cause it's really good.

07:25.846 --> 07:27.247
- Yeah!

07:27.347 --> 07:29.382
Funny how I didn't laugh
either time.

07:29.483 --> 07:33.320
Freddie, I-I came down here
to ask you a question. Um...

07:33.420 --> 07:36.323
Did you want iCarly
to be the most successful

07:36.423 --> 07:37.958
web series in history?

07:38.058 --> 07:40.360
Or did you want it to just be
like a massive failure?

07:40.460 --> 07:41.795
I mean, probably

07:41.895 --> 07:43.497
the most successful
web series in history.

07:43.597 --> 07:46.500
Duh. You don't have to answer
a question like that, Freddie.

07:47.234 --> 07:49.670
It begins.

07:49.770 --> 07:50.938
What begins?

07:51.038 --> 07:52.940
This is a partnership.

07:53.040 --> 07:54.374
Get ready for greatness, guys,

07:54.474 --> 07:56.343
'cause I've been brainstorming
and I've got

07:56.443 --> 07:58.646
some really,
really great ideas.

07:58.746 --> 08:01.715
Freddie, do you want me
to share those great ideas

08:01.815 --> 08:03.751
or just keep them to myself?

08:03.851 --> 08:06.486
Well, answer the man.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.822
- Share?
- It begins.

08:08.922 --> 08:10.223
I thought it already began.

08:10.323 --> 08:11.224
Oh, it's begun.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.561
First, focus on merchandising.

08:13.661 --> 08:16.530
Create content that features
things you can sell,

08:16.630 --> 08:17.598
like an iCarly doll.

08:17.698 --> 08:19.299
Ooh! Can my doll wear glasses?

08:19.399 --> 08:21.401
I've always wanted to see what
I'd look like with glasses on.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.904
She can be as visually
impaired as you want.

08:24.605 --> 08:27.207
Next great idea, live tour.

08:27.307 --> 08:29.643
Podcasters make bank
on the road, why not you, Carly?

08:29.743 --> 08:32.179
Oh, no.
Freddie won't go on tour.

08:32.279 --> 08:35.649
He watched a Dateline
about hotel sheets, so...

08:35.749 --> 08:37.551
Cool.

08:37.651 --> 08:40.520
Now, my last idea...
it's actually not great.

08:40.621 --> 08:41.789
It's amazing.

08:42.790 --> 08:45.492
Would you guys mind if I just
shake things up a little bit,

08:45.593 --> 08:47.460
and throw out an amazing idea?

08:47.561 --> 08:49.697
No, Paul.
I don't mind.

08:49.797 --> 08:51.131
So it begins.

08:51.231 --> 08:53.466
- For a third time?
- That's right.

08:53.567 --> 08:54.768
Thrice begunst.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.237
Collaborate
with other influencers.

08:57.337 --> 08:59.973
It-- Carly, there's simply
no better way

09:00.073 --> 09:01.541
to introduce you
to new fans.

09:01.642 --> 09:03.911
I can get you a collab
with The Tiny Psychic.

09:04.011 --> 09:06.580
You shut your dirty mouth!

09:06.680 --> 09:08.481
What do you think, Freddie?

09:08.582 --> 09:10.483
Do you want to make
the greatest episode

09:10.584 --> 09:11.919
of iCarly in history?

09:12.019 --> 09:13.020
Or do you want it to just
be like some massive--

09:13.120 --> 09:14.622
Don't do Paul's thing.

09:14.722 --> 09:17.390
I will agree to it, but
please don't do Paul's thing.

09:17.490 --> 09:19.359
Absolutely.

09:19.459 --> 09:21.094
But it begins!

09:21.194 --> 09:22.362
- She did it again.

09:22.462 --> 09:23.897
I did it again.

09:23.997 --> 09:25.532
But I'm done now.

09:33.707 --> 09:35.375
Wow! She's even tinier
in person.

09:35.475 --> 09:37.077
You know what's not tiny?

09:37.177 --> 09:38.846
Her list of ex-husbands.

09:38.946 --> 09:40.948
Seven. All dead.

09:41.749 --> 09:43.651
Hey, sorry I'm late,
but, uh...

09:43.751 --> 09:46.053
You probably knew
that was gonna happen, right?

09:47.154 --> 09:48.822
Doesn't work like that.

09:50.057 --> 09:54.261
In five, four,

09:54.361 --> 09:56.329
three, two...

09:56.429 --> 10:00.533
Carly, we'll be doing
your past, present and future

10:00.634 --> 10:02.502
card readings today.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.037
Oh. Do you know how I die?

10:04.137 --> 10:05.272
No, don't tell me.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.207
Do tell me.
Is it poison?

10:07.307 --> 10:10.010
- I hope it's poison.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.779
Uh, shoot. Sorry.
Um, someone's texting me

10:11.879 --> 10:13.981
about the Kevin app.
I'll just-- I'll silence it.

10:14.081 --> 10:15.582
Should we just shoot it
on my phone?

10:15.683 --> 10:18.151
I've got a prototype
of the 2023 PearPhone.

10:18.251 --> 10:20.187
It has, like, 11 cameras.

10:21.488 --> 10:23.757
Just CAT scanned
your brain, bro.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.560
We shoot iCarly
on my equipment.

10:27.661 --> 10:30.297
First, your past.

10:30.397 --> 10:31.631
The chicken card.

10:31.732 --> 10:34.134
The chicken
represents possessiveness,

10:34.234 --> 10:37.070
extreme sensitivity
and being too busy

10:37.170 --> 10:38.505
to do your job.

10:38.605 --> 10:40.640
Pfft. Seriously?

10:40.741 --> 10:42.609
How much did you pay her
to say this, Paul?

10:42.710 --> 10:43.944
I don't know
what you're talking about.

10:44.044 --> 10:46.313
Chicken card?
I was literally

10:46.413 --> 10:47.647
just dressed
like a chicken.

10:47.748 --> 10:51.151
Carly, the next card
is your present.

10:51.251 --> 10:53.353
Ah, yes, the fox card.

10:53.453 --> 10:55.823
Oh, come on!

10:55.923 --> 10:58.091
- What?
- Fox card?

10:58.191 --> 11:00.527
I bet the fox card is
all the things Paul is.

11:01.929 --> 11:07.200
The fox represents confidence,
cleverness, and beginnings.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.971
I did not tell her
to say that. Okay?

11:11.071 --> 11:13.040
But I told you
it has begun.

11:13.140 --> 11:16.243
Look, I'm not the fox,
you're not the chicken, right?

11:16.343 --> 11:18.578
Let's just start over
and use my sick PearPhone

11:18.678 --> 11:20.247
that only I and Tom Cruise have.

11:21.381 --> 11:23.817
This is exactly why I didn't
want to bring him on, okay?

11:23.917 --> 11:25.652
He's just trying
to make me look bad.

11:25.753 --> 11:27.387
- Give me that.
- Why?

11:27.487 --> 11:29.389
- I thought you didn't want it.
- Well, now it's the only way

11:29.489 --> 11:31.024
-Hey.
- we're gonna be able
to shoot the segment.

11:31.124 --> 11:32.760
Can you guys just try
to work together? Please!

11:32.860 --> 11:35.428
My crystal ball!

11:35.528 --> 11:37.297
It was a marble.

11:37.397 --> 11:38.799
This is all your fault.

11:38.899 --> 11:41.601
Look, I'm sorry, but
I cannot work with this guy.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.570
Okay? It's either him or me.

11:43.670 --> 11:45.438
Ah, that's exactly
what a chicken would say.

11:45.538 --> 11:48.608
Oh! So I am the chicken.

11:52.145 --> 11:55.515
All right, ladies,
you guys are like my food critic

11:55.615 --> 11:57.818
test run,
so what do you think?

11:57.918 --> 12:00.020
Tomatoes? In the winter?

12:00.120 --> 12:02.355
So help me God, if there's
blueberries in my dessert,

12:02.455 --> 12:03.690
I'm gonna scream.

12:04.557 --> 12:07.227
I guess this dump has never
heard of a little thing

12:07.327 --> 12:08.595
called "seasonality."

12:08.695 --> 12:10.030
Uh, we've heard of it.

12:10.130 --> 12:11.731
We just decided to go
in a different,

12:11.832 --> 12:13.600
less fresh direction.

12:14.968 --> 12:16.736
Thank you for helping out.

12:16.837 --> 12:18.271
Honestly, thank you.

12:18.371 --> 12:21.041
It's been good to get my mind
off my lack of mojo.

12:21.141 --> 12:22.575
I'm going method.

12:22.675 --> 12:26.013
Harper is a 29 year-old stylist
who's rude to waiters.

12:26.113 --> 12:29.917
I want to move!
It's drafty!

12:31.985 --> 12:34.321
All right, he's here.
Time to shine.

12:35.322 --> 12:36.689
Good evening, fine sir.

12:36.790 --> 12:38.525
Before I seat you,
may I take your coat off,

12:38.625 --> 12:40.627
which you're not wearing?

12:40.727 --> 12:43.430
If it's okay,
I'll just walk around.

12:43.530 --> 12:44.664
I ate before I came.

12:44.764 --> 12:47.034
Good call.
Wish I had done the same.

12:47.134 --> 12:50.603
They served us tomatoes
in this weather.

12:50.703 --> 12:52.572
Where are we, Portugal?

12:55.442 --> 12:59.913
Her mouth says Portugal,
but her humor says Catskills.

13:01.681 --> 13:03.083
Uh-huh.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.585
All right, this guy's
a weird one.

13:05.685 --> 13:07.087
You're gonna have
to really sell it.

13:14.594 --> 13:16.063
Mmm...

13:16.163 --> 13:20.033
Even I, whomst is
famously rude to waiters,

13:20.133 --> 13:24.104
cannot be rude when the food
is this delectable.

13:25.072 --> 13:26.373
Mmm.

13:26.473 --> 13:28.341
I would've expected
something more believable.

13:28.441 --> 13:32.445
Instead, you're giving desperate
stylist posing as an actor.

13:32.545 --> 13:37.050
A little more derivative
than your other work, but okay.

13:38.218 --> 13:40.653
Wait a minute. What do you
mean, "my other work"?

13:40.753 --> 13:43.290
This is an art installation,
right?

13:43.390 --> 13:47.327
Or did the Spencer Shay
quit making art

13:47.427 --> 13:50.263
to open a restaurant?

13:50.363 --> 13:53.366
Guess you had nothing left
to say. Pity.

13:54.267 --> 13:56.303
Uh... You thought
this was a restaurant?

13:56.403 --> 13:58.471
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
You were right.

13:58.571 --> 13:59.539
This is an installation.

13:59.639 --> 14:01.374
You're literally in the art.

14:01.474 --> 14:03.443
You are the art.

14:03.543 --> 14:04.777
"Yart."

14:05.745 --> 14:08.148
Would you excuse me, please?

14:08.248 --> 14:10.150
Okay.
He's not a food critic.

14:10.250 --> 14:12.920
He is an art critic, so we need
a new plan or we kill him.

14:13.020 --> 14:14.421
Those are the only two options.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.990
Maybe it would help
if my character were French.

14:19.492 --> 14:22.262
Garcon, croissant!

14:23.063 --> 14:24.631
No.

14:29.769 --> 14:31.204
Oh, you're safe.

14:32.105 --> 14:34.574
Can't believe I fell
for "911 quicksand."

14:34.674 --> 14:36.276
How'd she get you to come?

14:36.376 --> 14:37.844
She just asked me.

14:41.514 --> 14:43.250
Follow me, guys.

14:52.325 --> 14:53.493
What is this?

14:53.593 --> 14:55.595
It's an opportunity
for the two of you

14:55.695 --> 14:57.130
to learn
how to work together,

14:57.230 --> 15:00.200
to become the team
that I know you can be.

15:01.034 --> 15:03.136
It's an escape room.

15:05.738 --> 15:07.507
I really wish I had peed.

15:07.607 --> 15:12.045
Freddie, inizia.
That's Italian for, "it begins."

15:12.145 --> 15:14.514
Ah. Disagree, Paul.

15:14.614 --> 15:16.183
It is not beginning.

15:16.283 --> 15:18.185
So why don't you just go back
to where you came from?

15:18.285 --> 15:20.353
Italy.
Or so you say.

15:20.453 --> 15:23.256
Actually, joke's on you,
because I was originally born

15:23.356 --> 15:26.226
in Iowa, two weeks early.
What's up?

15:26.960 --> 15:28.195
Guys, stop it.

15:29.929 --> 15:31.364
Did that wall just move?

15:31.464 --> 15:33.400
Carly, are you okay?
I know you get claustrophobic.

15:33.500 --> 15:36.269
Yeah, bro,
I know stuff about her.

15:36.369 --> 15:38.438
Remember, I was her you
in Italy,

15:38.538 --> 15:40.907
except better, because
I look dope eating pasta.

15:41.008 --> 15:43.676
- Don't you eat that pasta.
- Mmm, here, have some.
It's good.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.078
Don't-- Don't feed it to me.

15:45.178 --> 15:46.646
- Trust me, it's really good.
- I am full!

15:46.746 --> 15:49.249
Guys, the walls closing in
was not in the brochure

15:49.349 --> 15:51.118
and I am trying
not to freak out.

15:53.553 --> 15:55.955
I always wanted
to learn the flute!

15:56.056 --> 15:57.857
I just had to say that
before I die,

15:57.957 --> 16:00.393
which is obviously happening.

16:06.966 --> 16:09.602
Wow. These magazines from
the '70s have not aged well.

16:09.702 --> 16:12.339
They made cigarettes
exclusively for pregnant women?

16:12.439 --> 16:14.241
Carly, little help?

16:14.341 --> 16:16.443
No. You have
to work together,

16:16.543 --> 16:18.345
'cause I am
too busy freaking out.

16:18.445 --> 16:20.013
God, I wish I was pregnant,

16:20.113 --> 16:22.482
so I could have
one of those cigarettes.

16:22.582 --> 16:23.950
Paul, will you stop trying
to turn on that computer

16:24.051 --> 16:25.818
- and come help me?
- Hey, if I wanted to turn

16:25.918 --> 16:27.287
this computer on,
all I would have to say

16:27.387 --> 16:29.122
is, "Sup, girl?"

16:30.090 --> 16:32.792
What are you doing?

16:34.394 --> 16:36.329
There. I did it.

16:36.429 --> 16:38.031
What do you mean,
you did it?

16:38.131 --> 16:39.466
I did 95% of the work

16:39.566 --> 16:41.134
and you came in
and took all the credit,

16:41.234 --> 16:43.270
which is exactly what you're
trying to do with iCarly.

16:43.370 --> 16:44.971
Can you guys
just stop arguing

16:45.072 --> 16:47.074
and figure out what the clue
on the TV means?

16:48.541 --> 16:49.842
No! No! I can't die!

16:49.942 --> 16:52.845
I never got Ricky Martin
to sign my wrist.

16:56.516 --> 16:57.917
All right, change of plans.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.387
This guy is an art critic,
so he is about to have

17:00.487 --> 17:02.622
the worst
dining experience ever.

17:02.722 --> 17:06.293
Please, do me the honor
of having an awful meal.

17:06.393 --> 17:08.461
So just continue on
as we were.

17:08.561 --> 17:10.097
Yeah.

17:11.798 --> 17:14.467
Bon appétit!
Losers!

17:18.638 --> 17:20.273
Our meat isn't undercooked.

17:20.373 --> 17:21.808
It's frozen!

17:21.908 --> 17:24.010
They kind of look like
boomerangs, so why don't you

17:24.111 --> 17:26.579
toss them and see
if they come back to you?

17:27.380 --> 17:28.815
Oof!

17:28.915 --> 17:30.117
Nope!

17:41.328 --> 17:43.463
Mark?

17:43.563 --> 17:45.132
Are you asking me
to marry you?

17:49.769 --> 17:52.105
I thought you were
proposing to me tonight.

17:52.205 --> 17:54.141
Now I have to watch her
get engaged?

17:55.308 --> 17:56.676
Some music
for your special evening?

17:56.776 --> 17:58.578
- Ugh, no!

18:04.351 --> 18:06.486
It's for real.

18:08.655 --> 18:11.158
Would you like some water, sir?

18:11.258 --> 18:12.859
Uh...

18:15.061 --> 18:18.598
Excellent! Waiters
these days are drowning

18:18.698 --> 18:20.800
in the outrageous demands
of the consumer.

18:20.900 --> 18:22.669
- Okay.

18:24.137 --> 18:26.539
Leaving so soon?
What'd you think?

18:26.639 --> 18:28.775
It's been
a devastating commentary

18:28.875 --> 18:31.811
on the toxic relationship
between those who serve

18:31.911 --> 18:33.045
and those who are served.

18:33.146 --> 18:34.814
Okay!

18:35.982 --> 18:38.251
But it didn't have
that Spencer Shay

18:38.351 --> 18:40.987
signature touch.
Pity.

18:47.927 --> 18:49.396
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

18:49.496 --> 18:50.763
Oh, my God!

18:50.863 --> 18:52.699
Oh, my good arm!
Oh, my good arm!

18:52.799 --> 18:54.834
- My less good arm!
- Oh, my God!

18:54.934 --> 18:57.069
This must be a metaphor
for something.

18:57.170 --> 18:58.271
Oh, that's right.

18:58.371 --> 18:59.872
The service industry
is burned out.

18:59.972 --> 19:02.242
And unless something changes,
it always will be!

19:02.342 --> 19:06.045
Now that's the Spencer Shay
touch I was looking for.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.680
No longer a pity!

19:11.318 --> 19:14.587
Yes! We did it!
I'm so happy for you.

19:14.687 --> 19:16.889
- Hospital?

19:16.989 --> 19:18.124
Yup!

19:20.627 --> 19:23.029
- Fire is hot.
- It usually is, baby.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.205
Can you guys please
get us out of here?

19:32.305 --> 19:35.107
I am hyperventilating, I'm on
the verge of a panic attack,

19:35.208 --> 19:37.344
and I picked
an exhausting distraction.

19:37.444 --> 19:41.748
Seriously, this is what people
won't shut up about?

19:41.848 --> 19:44.484
Ooh.
iCarly exercise video.

19:44.584 --> 19:46.786
Ooh, sucky idea.

19:46.886 --> 19:48.821
Hey, you two both keep saying

19:48.921 --> 19:50.423
that you want what's best
for iCarly.

19:50.523 --> 19:51.991
Well, guess what?

19:52.091 --> 19:55.662
I'm Carly, so I know
what's best for the show.

19:55.762 --> 19:57.630
And that's for both of you
to work on it.

19:57.730 --> 19:59.266
Together.

19:59.366 --> 20:02.902
But if you can't work together,
then I'll do it myself.

20:04.771 --> 20:07.206
I don't want to do it myself.
Make up already.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.977
She's right, okay?
I'm sorry.

20:11.077 --> 20:13.280
I-I know how much she loved
working with you in Italy,

20:13.380 --> 20:15.415
and I-I don't know,
I guess I just felt...

20:15.515 --> 20:17.484
- threatened by you.
- Yes!

20:17.584 --> 20:18.585
Good stuff, Freddie.

20:18.685 --> 20:19.786
Paul, now you go.

20:19.886 --> 20:21.220
I'm sorry, too.

20:21.321 --> 20:23.155
You guys have been doing this
for 15 years.

20:23.256 --> 20:25.592
No one could replace
what you do for the show.

20:25.692 --> 20:27.660
I shouldn't have come in so hot.
Or tall.

20:27.760 --> 20:29.629
But I-I can't help
either of those things.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.331
Attaboy, Paul.

20:31.431 --> 20:33.266
Very powerful stuff.

20:33.366 --> 20:34.834
Now, get us out of here.

20:36.202 --> 20:38.771
All right. Um, let's, uh,
let's start with the code

20:38.871 --> 20:40.507
on the TV, okay?
Maybe it's a combination.

20:40.607 --> 20:42.509
Uh...

20:42.609 --> 20:43.676
The leather briefcase!

20:43.776 --> 20:44.811
Ooh, oh, yeah.
Uh, okay.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.679
Four one seven.

20:46.779 --> 20:47.780
Come on, come on, come on!

20:49.416 --> 20:50.517
- Attaboy! Okay.
- Okay.

20:50.617 --> 20:52.885
Uh, uh...

20:53.820 --> 20:54.754
Maybe the next clue is up?

20:54.854 --> 20:56.423
Okay, um...

20:57.524 --> 20:59.025
Paul, give me a boost.

20:59.125 --> 21:02.028
- I would love to boost you.
- Okay. Here we go.

21:03.596 --> 21:05.332
- Wow, nice boost.
- Thanks.

21:07.500 --> 21:08.868
Oh, oh.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.474
Yeah! Yeah!

21:15.207 --> 21:17.810
- Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah. I was always okay.

21:17.910 --> 21:18.978
I knew the walls
were gonna do that,

21:19.078 --> 21:20.246
so I took a beta blocker.

21:20.347 --> 21:22.549
I thought that wasn't
in the brochure.

21:22.649 --> 21:24.917
I lied.

21:27.754 --> 21:29.322
Wait, where are we?

21:29.422 --> 21:31.791
It looks like... the '80s?

21:31.891 --> 21:33.326
But I thought
we were done.

21:33.426 --> 21:35.595
You're not done.

21:35.695 --> 21:37.797
You still have four more
decades to escape from.

21:43.670 --> 21:46.205
Ooh. Uh... okay.

21:46.305 --> 21:47.374
Uh-oh.

21:47.474 --> 21:48.808
- Yeah, that's real.

21:48.908 --> 21:51.077
All right, Carly, Carly.
It's okay. Maybe...

21:51.177 --> 21:52.479
Just, uh, just take a moment...

22:10.430 --> 22:12.465
Oh!

22:13.633 --> 22:16.436
Oh. What's that?

22:20.407 --> 22:23.209

Wow, I actually thought
you were gonna catch something,

right there.

22:27.013 --> 22:30.450
Thank you. I've been doing
some acting recently.

22:32.419 --> 22:36.523
I said no ice!

22:37.824 --> 22:39.759
Stuff like that.

22:40.560 --> 22:43.262

of this community of artists.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.164

22:52.605 --> 22:54.073

22:54.173 --> 22:55.942

22:56.042 --> 22:58.478
before she eats it.

22:59.045 --> 23:01.548

- It's golf.

23:01.648 --> 23:03.483
But with meatballs.

23:34.046 --> 23:36.182
I left my gummies out again.

23:36.282 --> 23:37.450
Can you go make sure
they're okay?

23:37.550 --> 23:38.918
Nah, they'll be back
for the chips.

24:08.948 --> 24:10.650
Ooh!

24:10.750 --> 24:12.952
