And, uh, for those who know
a little about Cuban baseball

02:20.959 --> 02:24.750
this is Gonzalo Luque,
the Cuban Mickey Mantle.

02:24.834 --> 02:26.667
And I'm happy to announce
that he has just signed

02:26.750 --> 02:29.125
with the Philadelphia
Phillies organization

02:29.208 --> 02:32.667
and he will report to the
Redding Phils next week.

02:35.125 --> 02:37.041
Gonzalo would like
to say something.

02:37.125 --> 02:40.000
Hey. Hello, America.

02:41.250 --> 02:44.417
Thank you, and...I
want to play baseball.

03:31.709 --> 03:33.125
Those are all
the possible
matches.

03:33.208 --> 03:36.125
A couple of gang shootings,
robbery gone bad.

03:36.208 --> 03:37.959
Two stone-cold whodunits.

03:38.041 --> 03:39.709

03:52.875 --> 03:55.542

Lemme guess, you're
looking at a boat ride

03:57.041 --> 03:58.250
back to Port-au-Prince.

03:58.333 --> 03:59.625
Yes, sir.

03:59.709 --> 04:01.250
Eddie'd rather spend a
month
in lockup here

04:01.333 --> 04:02.792
than go back to
the Haitian
clinker.

04:02.875 --> 04:05.792
Look, I testify,
I get to stay, right?

04:05.875 --> 04:07.959
It depends what you got.

04:08.041 --> 04:09.458
It was October.

04:09.542 --> 04:12.417
Pretty good memory with all
that
praying you been doing, Eddie.

04:12.500 --> 04:13.458
It's the truth.

04:13.542 --> 04:16.333
I remember
because of the pumpkins.

04:16.417 --> 04:17.792
Start with a location.

04:17.875 --> 04:20.709
That sandlot
near Lancaster Avenue.

04:22.750 --> 04:24.208
Wrong answer.

04:24.291 --> 04:26.542
(Scotty)
We got no unsolved
murders in that area.

04:26.625 --> 04:27.792
I warned you about
wasting our time.

04:27.875 --> 04:29.417
It was that baseball player.

04:29.500 --> 04:31.583
He was going to play
for the Phillies.

04:31.667 --> 04:34.041
The guy's name
was Gonzalo Luque.

04:34.125 --> 04:35.333
<i>Oui.</i>

04:35.417 --> 04:38.250
Only problem, Eddie,
is,
uh, Gonzalo was killed

04:38.333 --> 04:41.000
about five miles
from Lancaster Avenue.

04:41.083 --> 04:43.083
Body was found in the Badlands.

04:43.166 --> 04:45.083
Tha-that's not what I saw.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.792
Yo, man.

05:10.375 --> 05:12.375
I come out, the body gone.

05:12.458 --> 05:13.709
Oh, you couldn't swipe Jesus

05:13.792 --> 05:15.542
so you settled
for the Louisville slugger?

05:17.083 --> 05:18.291
(Lilly)
You see the car?

05:18.375 --> 05:20.625
- No.
- What about the bat?

05:20.709 --> 05:22.041
Perfectly good bat.

05:22.125 --> 05:25.875
I give it to my nephew
Patrick.
He hit real keen with it.

05:25.959 --> 05:26.875
Bring us the bat.

05:26.959 --> 05:28.083
We'll see what we can do

05:28.166 --> 05:30.583

your jail time in America.

(John)
Gonzalo Luque, 23 years
old.

06:15.125 --> 06:18.500
Found dead in an alley
off Elkhart in the
Badlands

06:18.583 --> 06:21.083
morning of October 22, 1999.

06:21.166 --> 06:24.500
Cause of death,
blunt-force trauma to the
chest

06:24.583 --> 06:26.250
resulting in cardiac arrest.

06:26.333 --> 06:28.667
(Scotty)
Assigned back in the day
figured that 'hood

06:28.750 --> 06:32.125
Gonzalo was looking
for drugs, guns, or tail.

06:32.208 --> 06:33.959
(John)
'Played for Double-A Redding.'

06:34.041 --> 06:35.375
(Scotty)
'Uh, guy could rake.'

06:35.458 --> 06:36.583
'Big league club invited him'

06:36.667 --> 06:38.083
to Spring training.

06:38.166 --> 06:39.667
Yeah, he'd have won
a ring last season.

06:41.083 --> 06:43.834
The bat Eddie the Haitian
says was next to the body.

06:44.750 --> 06:46.125
Oh, that could be a good match

06:46.208 --> 06:49.125
for the contusion
that killed him.

06:49.208 --> 06:51.083
Initials, "ST"

06:51.166 --> 06:52.709
(Will)
'The proffer
was asked about that.'

06:52.792 --> 06:54.542
He said the letters
were there already.

06:54.625 --> 06:56.834
Lumber could belong
to one of his teammates.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.750
Nobody with those
initials on the
team.

06:58.834 --> 07:01.333
So now we got
a dead baseball player's body

07:01.417 --> 07:03.000
being moved across town.

07:03.083 --> 07:06.291
Or maybe our doer didn't want
the lot connected to the body.

07:06.375 --> 07:08.625
I didn't even know there
was a baseball diamond
there.

07:08.709 --> 07:12.500
Detective back in '99 spoke
to Jaime Reyes, Gonzalo's agent

07:12.583 --> 07:14.667
and a cousin, Juan de la Cruz.

07:14.750 --> 07:18.166
Says here Gonzalo's wife Piedad
and son Andres turned up

07:18.250 --> 07:20.041
near Key West
day after his murder.

07:20.125 --> 07:22.917
Wanna double-check that story
along with this cousin.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.166
Find out what Gonzalo
was doing on that
field.

07:25.250 --> 07:27.458
I'll see what
the agent remembers.

07:27.542 --> 07:28.792
Guy makes it
all the way from Cuba

07:28.875 --> 07:31.000
ends up dead in an alley.

07:35.166 --> 07:38.125
Oh, Cuban Pete's
all over this one.

07:38.208 --> 07:40.291
Yeah, well..

07:40.375 --> 07:42.125
I'm half Puerto Rican.

07:42.208 --> 07:44.166
Maybe the doer's Puerto Rican.

07:47.208 --> 07:48.709
Alright, everybody, listen up!

07:48.792 --> 07:51.250
Sign-up sheet
for the annual softball game

07:51.333 --> 07:52.917
against the fire department.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.834
We won't get hosed
like we did last year.

07:54.917 --> 07:57.083
To that end, they got
a ringer down in Patrol.

07:57.166 --> 07:58.875
The guy is unhittable.

07:58.959 --> 08:00.583
Been a rule change this year.

08:00.667 --> 08:05.125
- Mandated coed teams, so..
- Sounds good. Sign me up.

08:06.333 --> 08:07.583
Can you catch?

08:07.667 --> 08:09.166
Hell, yeah, I can catch.

08:09.250 --> 08:10.375
You throw like a girl?

08:10.458 --> 08:12.959
You dance like a white guy?

08:13.041 --> 08:16.166
Alright, pencil you
in as alternate, bench.

08:16.250 --> 08:17.542
You throw like a girl?

08:17.625 --> 08:18.750
Yup.

08:18.834 --> 08:19.875
Catch?

08:19.959 --> 08:20.875
Not so much.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.250
Alright, you're our catcher.

08:26.417 --> 08:29.166
And you're riding bitch with
me all the way to Union City.

08:29.250 --> 08:32.542
Located the victim's
wife, Piedad Luque.

08:35.375 --> 08:37.125
Hmm!

08:37.625 --> 08:38.959
Alright.

08:43.083 --> 08:44.041
See you later, Mom.

08:44.125 --> 08:45.625
Make sure you
take the bus back.

08:45.709 --> 08:46.875
I don't wanna hear about you
cutting through the park.

08:46.959 --> 08:48.000
Okay.

08:48.083 --> 08:49.625
<i>ven aca.</i>

08:56.291 --> 08:58.583
Please, uh, sit.

08:58.667 --> 08:59.917
(Nick)
Does Andres know

09:00.000 --> 09:02.250
the circumstances
around his father's death?

09:02.333 --> 09:04.542
No, I never believed
what they said

09:04.625 --> 09:06.875
Gonzalo was doing
in that part of town.

09:06.959 --> 09:08.083
He was a family man.

09:08.166 --> 09:09.667
(Kat)
'Wondering how Gonzalo could'

09:09.750 --> 09:11.583
leave you and
your son back in
Cuba.

09:11.667 --> 09:12.792
He had no choice.

09:12.875 --> 09:14.041
None of this would have happened

09:14.125 --> 09:17.375
if they hadn't taken
baseball away from him.

09:17.458 --> 09:18.792
Who's "they"?

09:18.875 --> 09:21.083
The Cuban government.

09:21.166 --> 09:23.709
They said he and some
other players had contact

09:23.792 --> 09:25.333
with an American sports agent.

09:25.417 --> 09:27.667
That agent Jaime Reyes?

09:27.750 --> 09:29.667
Yes.

09:29.750 --> 09:33.625
After the ban,
it was a nightmare.

09:33.709 --> 09:37.792
No money, no food, no friends.

09:37.875 --> 09:41.291
That why Gonzalo
left,
to make a new start?

09:41.375 --> 09:43.500
Hardest decision of his life.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.834
But once he'd made it,
there was no turning back.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.875
And that was it.

10:32.959 --> 10:34.375
The last time I saw him.

10:34.458 --> 10:36.792
(Nick)
You had plans to join
him?

10:36.875 --> 10:39.291
When the time was right.

10:39.375 --> 10:41.166
Hell of a raft trip.

10:41.250 --> 10:43.208
Would have done anything
to see him again.

10:43.291 --> 10:45.125
You stay in touch with
him
when he got to Philly?

10:45.208 --> 10:46.375
It wasn't easy.

10:46.458 --> 10:49.792
Our phone calls
were monitored, letters
opened.

10:49.875 --> 10:52.041
He mention any problems to you?

10:52.125 --> 10:53.125
No.

10:53.208 --> 10:55.125
Juan said Gonzalo
was very excited

10:55.208 --> 10:57.333
we would be
joining him in America.

10:57.417 --> 10:58.709
Juan, his cousin?

10:58.792 --> 11:00.709
Yeah, he was my cousin.

11:00.792 --> 11:03.458
But Gonzalito was more like..

11:03.542 --> 11:05.250
...like my little brother.

11:06.041 --> 11:08.542
I came to-to America..

11:08.625 --> 11:10.417
...two months
before he was killed.

11:10.500 --> 11:13.583
Juan, where were you
the night Gonzalo was killed?

11:13.667 --> 11:16.291
You guys are not
Internal Revenue.

11:16.375 --> 11:18.750
I was, uh,
I was removing asbestos

11:18.834 --> 11:20.917
off the books,
at Liberty
Towers.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.458
I worked my way up since then.

11:22.542 --> 11:24.250
You ever go to that old sandlot

11:24.333 --> 11:26.458
near Lancaster Avenue
with Gonzalo?

11:26.542 --> 11:27.709
Lancaster Avenue?

11:27.792 --> 11:30.667
Yeah, a lot of pickup
baseball games there.

11:30.750 --> 11:32.417
- Familiar with it?
- Not that one.

11:32.500 --> 11:34.709
But Gonzalito,
he-he loved baseball.

11:34.792 --> 11:35.959
He would see a game and..

11:36.041 --> 11:38.583
[chuckling]
...stop to ask if he could
play.

11:38.667 --> 11:40.125
He always had his
equipment with
him.

11:40.208 --> 11:42.041
Is this Gonzalo's bat?

11:46.458 --> 11:49.583
No, not Gonzalo's.
It's too heavy.

11:49.667 --> 11:51.750
He was a contact hitter.

11:51.834 --> 11:53.667
He put the ball anywhere.

11:53.750 --> 11:56.583
Know anybody
with those initials?

11:56.667 --> 11:58.458
[whispering]
No.

11:59.208 --> 12:00.250
You play ball?

12:00.333 --> 12:01.792
A little in Cuba.

12:01.875 --> 12:03.834
Pero olvidate

12:03.917 --> 12:05.291
it was all work.

12:05.375 --> 12:09.041
Did you happen to see
Gonzalo on the day he died?

12:10.375 --> 12:12.625
I was busy working.

12:12.709 --> 12:13.875
He was training hard.

12:13.959 --> 12:16.542
Getting ready for Spring
training in October?

12:16.625 --> 12:19.291
It's what he loved.

12:19.375 --> 12:21.959
Couldn't believe all the
things
this country had given him.

12:26.667 --> 12:29.875
Oye,
that garbage,
huh?

12:48.250 --> 12:49.667
<i>Mira.</i>

12:49.750 --> 12:51.834
<i>primo.</i>

12:51.917 --> 12:53.500
<i>- Primo.</i>

12:53.583 --> 12:55.834
Oye,
looking fresh off the
boat.

12:57.625 --> 12:59.166
<i>- Oye.</i>
-

12:59.250 --> 13:00.375
You hungry?

13:11.333 --> 13:13.375
You see this one?

13:13.458 --> 13:14.583
This one's reserved for the day

13:14.667 --> 13:17.875
that Cuba's free
of its oppressor.

13:17.959 --> 13:19.291
May it be soon..

13:19.375 --> 13:20.875
...and may it be painful.

13:20.959 --> 13:23.208
Amen.

13:27.959 --> 13:29.709
Juan de la Cruz

13:29.792 --> 13:31.375
welcome to the land

13:31.458 --> 13:33.709
<i>imperialistas!</i>

13:33.792 --> 13:35.417
<i>Traidor!</i>

13:41.083 --> 13:43.792
I still have that champagne.

13:43.875 --> 13:46.500
It won't be the same
when I can finally open it.

13:49.792 --> 13:51.041
On my father's side.

13:51.125 --> 13:53.709
I was born here, though.

13:59.917 --> 14:03.250
<i>Chicos? Gringa.</i>

14:04.792 --> 14:06.291
(Lilly)
'Now, how much money
did Gonzalo'

14:06.375 --> 14:08.417
stand to make when
he got called up, Juan?

14:08.500 --> 14:12.500
Gonzalo made seven dollars a
month playing baseball in
Cuba.

14:12.583 --> 14:14.083
He had no idea about millions.

14:14.166 --> 14:17.333
(Juan)
'His, uh, agent
managed everything.'

14:17.417 --> 14:19.250
Oh, Jaime Reyes?

14:19.333 --> 14:21.583
And his...agent
managed his money, too?

14:21.667 --> 14:23.333
(Juan)
After he
died

14:23.417 --> 14:27.542
Reyes tried to screw Piedad
out of what money was left.

14:39.542 --> 14:40.583
Detectives.

14:40.667 --> 14:42.917
- Sparkling water?
- No.

14:43.000 --> 14:46.417
We, uh, we have some questions
about your former client

14:46.500 --> 14:47.959
Gonzalo Luque.

14:48.041 --> 14:49.542
(Will)
'Spoke to Gonzalo's widow.'

14:49.625 --> 14:51.542
'Said it was your contact
with him that got him'

14:51.625 --> 14:53.583
banned from baseball in Cuba.

14:53.667 --> 14:56.417
I offered him freedom
and a better way of
life.

14:56.500 --> 14:58.458
(Will)
And what'd you offer
his widow after he died?

14:58.542 --> 15:00.959
Everything Gonzalo had
left,
which wasn't much.

15:01.041 --> 15:02.125
He did what they all do.

15:02.208 --> 15:04.417
Fancy cars,
nice clothes,
jewelry.

15:04.500 --> 15:06.333
We understand
you managed his money.

15:06.417 --> 15:08.834
I run a full-service
agency.
There's a problem?

15:08.917 --> 15:10.166
(John)
'His widow thought
there should've been'

15:10.250 --> 15:11.959
more of that money left over.

15:12.041 --> 15:15.625
[chuckling]
Piedad never quite grasped
the probate process.

15:15.709 --> 15:19.166
Exactly how much
did she grasp?

15:19.250 --> 15:21.875
Lay the money out for us, Jaime.

15:21.959 --> 15:23.333
I'm gonna have to
find
Gonzalo's records.

15:23.417 --> 15:24.625
It could take a day or two.

15:24.709 --> 15:26.250
I put everything
in an off-site
storage

15:26.333 --> 15:28.041
when we moved
to our new
offices.

15:28.125 --> 15:29.583
Well, you've done
quite well for yourself.

15:29.667 --> 15:32.166
I started with a desk
in my garage.

15:32.250 --> 15:33.959
Cuban players
are good for business.

15:34.041 --> 15:36.875
Well, now, yeah,
but... Gonzalo was my first.

15:36.959 --> 15:38.500
With his skills
in today's market

15:38.583 --> 15:41.125
forget it, you're talking
about top-of-league money.

15:42.083 --> 15:43.792
Watch this. Watch this.

15:48.542 --> 15:51.125
<i>Savage, Gonzalo, savage!</i>

16:01.542 --> 16:03.417
Hey!

16:08.333 --> 16:09.750
It's hard for a guy
like that to see
someone

16:09.834 --> 16:11.750
who's been touched
by the baseball
gods.

16:11.834 --> 16:13.041
Who was he?

16:13.125 --> 16:15.375
Eric Hynes, he got
demoted to right
field

16:15.458 --> 16:16.542
to make room for Gonzalo.

16:16.625 --> 16:19.333
That's him on the right.

16:20.834 --> 16:22.750
(John)
'This Hynes ever
make it to the bigs?'

16:22.834 --> 16:26.375
[chuckling]
No. No, he got popped
for a domestic assault charge.

16:26.458 --> 16:29.375
And he was arrested for waving
a gun around in a nightclub.

16:30.333 --> 16:32.542
Eric "Showtime" Hynes.

16:32.625 --> 16:33.834
Showtime?

16:33.917 --> 16:36.917
(Will)
'ST, same initials on the
bat.'

16:37.000 --> 16:39.417
Uh, nothing like having
a signed murder weapon.

16:48.125 --> 16:50.417
Hell, yeah, I remember Gonz.

16:50.500 --> 16:52.917
Boy had wheels in center field.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.667
Shame he got killed like that.

16:54.750 --> 16:55.625
Killed like how?

16:55.709 --> 16:57.250
Messing where he was messing.

16:57.333 --> 17:00.291
You mean the Badlands or that
sandlot by Lancaster Avenue?

17:01.375 --> 17:03.583
You trying to cross
me up or something?

17:04.333 --> 17:05.583
Still on probation.

17:05.667 --> 17:08.000
Getting ready
to start a hitting clinic.

17:08.083 --> 17:11.041
Pass on my techniques
to disadvantaged youths.

17:11.125 --> 17:14.208
Oh, domestic assault ought to go
over big with the baseball moms.

17:14.291 --> 17:16.667
Yeah, why don't you
give us some pointers
on..

17:16.750 --> 17:19.625
...how you take out
your competition,
Showtime.

17:19.709 --> 17:20.917
Where'd you get that stick?

17:21.000 --> 17:23.458
At the crime scene.

17:23.542 --> 17:24.458
The giveaway..

17:24.542 --> 17:25.917
the "ST" right here.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.333
Technically, "Showtime"
is one word, Einstein.

17:28.417 --> 17:29.959
May be time to change
your name to Jail Time

17:30.041 --> 17:31.417
just to get a jump on things.

17:31.500 --> 17:34.083
I gave that bat to him.

17:34.166 --> 17:35.959
I told him
he could grow into
it.

17:36.041 --> 17:37.959
You and Gonz buried the hatchet.

17:38.041 --> 17:40.417
That's right.

17:40.500 --> 17:43.709
To tell you the truth I always
felt a little guilty when..

17:43.792 --> 17:45.125
...I heard they
thought he was uptown

17:45.208 --> 17:47.125
looking for a little
something something.

17:47.208 --> 17:49.083
You introduce him
to some of your bad habits?

17:49.166 --> 17:53.417
Nah. Nah, Gonz was
a pretty straight
arrow.

17:54.667 --> 17:56.166
I just showed him how to roll.

17:58.125 --> 17:59.709
Hey, Havana.

17:59.792 --> 18:03.250
You want a nipple for that
Libre
there?

18:03.333 --> 18:04.917
<i>mentirita.</i>

18:05.041 --> 18:06.834
Translation, Havana.

18:06.917 --> 18:08.083
It's a lie.

18:08.166 --> 18:09.250
<i>libre.</i>

18:10.917 --> 18:12.458
(ShowTime)
'Hey, how about that?'

18:12.542 --> 18:14.125
(ShowTime)
'That's Marisol.'

18:14.208 --> 18:16.291
Damn, she's bringing it tonight!

18:16.375 --> 18:18.041
You wanna take
a cut at that,
Papa?

18:18.125 --> 18:20.500
- No, I'm okay.
- Uh, no, you ain't.

18:20.583 --> 18:23.750
What you need is a
dip
in the Caribbean.

18:26.917 --> 18:30.083
- What's up, E?
- Hey, Marisol, Marisol!

18:30.166 --> 18:32.333
I want you to meet
my man here from Havana.

18:32.417 --> 18:34.041
- Gonzalo.
- Marisol.

18:34.125 --> 18:36.500
Yeah, Gonzalo here
is fresh off the boat.

18:36.583 --> 18:39.375
He needs someone to talk
to him in his native tongue.

18:41.500 --> 18:45.375
[chuckling]
Oh, my man!

18:54.417 --> 18:56.000
Marisol had an eye for the guys

18:56.083 --> 18:58.208
who were gonna
pull down the coin.

18:58.291 --> 19:00.375
You know he had a wife
and kid back in Cuba?

19:00.458 --> 19:02.959
[chuckling]
He never told me about that.

19:03.041 --> 19:06.542
Look. Gonz was real lonely.

19:06.625 --> 19:08.500
Marisol helped relieve him

19:08.583 --> 19:13.333
of some of that loneliness
on a nightly basis.

19:13.417 --> 19:17.166
You see them together
before Gonzalo was
killed?

19:17.250 --> 19:19.208
I don't exactly recall.

19:19.291 --> 19:20.709
(Kat)
How about you?

19:21.375 --> 19:22.625
How about me what?

19:22.709 --> 19:26.250
Where were you the night
Gonz got killed, October
21?

19:26.959 --> 19:29.125
Fall of '99.

19:29.208 --> 19:31.959
I was patrolling center field
for the Taipei Gida.

19:33.291 --> 19:35.709
Had a nice little run
over there in Taiwan.

19:37.333 --> 19:38.959
Till I snapped a hammy.

19:41.333 --> 19:44.417
(Nick)
Son of a bitch!

19:44.500 --> 19:47.417
There he goes again
disrespecting the
furnishings.

19:48.458 --> 19:50.250
I lost my ringer.

19:50.333 --> 19:52.667
Turns out the guy's wife works
for those fire-dousing ferries

19:52.750 --> 19:55.542
and she threatened to cut
him off if he pitches for
us.

19:55.625 --> 19:58.250
- Slow or fast pitch?
- Slow.

19:58.333 --> 20:00.667
I played a little beer league.

20:01.542 --> 20:03.917
They called me the Golden Arch.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.083
Let's see it, Mickey D.

20:08.333 --> 20:10.709
Ready?

20:15.417 --> 20:17.125
(John)
We'll see you on the field.

20:20.291 --> 20:23.333
Marisol, your name came up
in an investigation.

20:23.417 --> 20:25.375
(Scotty)
Gonzalo Luque.

20:25.458 --> 20:27.291
Like a decade ago.

20:27.375 --> 20:29.083
I've moved on.

20:29.166 --> 20:30.792
Heard you had a
thing
for ballplayers.

20:30.875 --> 20:33.792
In our line of work,
we get badge bunnies.

20:33.875 --> 20:35.166
Not into cops.

20:35.250 --> 20:36.291
Too controlling.

20:36.375 --> 20:38.125
That's a shame.

20:38.208 --> 20:39.959
Gonzalo another notch
on your bedpost?

20:40.041 --> 20:41.250
Okay, what is this about?

20:41.333 --> 20:42.667
Oh, your boyfriend's found dead

20:42.750 --> 20:44.125
and you don't come
forward with
information.

20:44.208 --> 20:46.959
- He wasn't my boyfriend.
- Huh.

20:47.041 --> 20:49.625
Well, then, maybe
another
player in your roster

20:49.709 --> 20:53.333
took exception to the hours
you were keeping with
Gonzalo.

20:53.417 --> 20:56.000
I told you we weren't
together when he was killed.

20:57.166 --> 20:58.542
It was complicated.

20:58.625 --> 21:01.125
Uncomplicate it for us, then.

21:01.208 --> 21:04.834
[scoffing]
Broke my rule..

21:04.917 --> 21:07.625
...and fell for the guy.

21:09.208 --> 21:10.500
(Gonzalo)
'How come every time
I ask you about them'

21:10.583 --> 21:12.542
'you change
the subject, hmm?'

21:12.625 --> 21:14.500
You know how things
are over there.

21:14.583 --> 21:17.125
I...wanna know
about my family.

21:18.083 --> 21:19.667
Andrecito looks just like you.

21:25.500 --> 21:26.625
(Gonzalo)
'I write, I call.'

21:26.709 --> 21:28.250
(Juan)
She's being careful.

21:28.333 --> 21:30.166
Things are not so easy for her.

21:30.250 --> 21:32.375
What?

21:32.458 --> 21:34.583
She do? She with someone else?

21:36.125 --> 21:39.250
[sighing]
She filed for divorce.

21:42.417 --> 21:45.083
Gonzalito, what did you expect?

21:46.250 --> 21:49.750
<i>primo.</i>

21:49.834 --> 21:51.000
I need to get my son back.

21:51.083 --> 21:53.250
No, no, no,
Andrecito is just a
kid.

21:53.333 --> 21:55.542
It-it's too dangerous.

21:56.917 --> 21:58.500
Nothing is impossible
here, Juan.

21:59.792 --> 22:03.500
I'm gonna do what I have
to do to see my son.

22:09.291 --> 22:12.083
He had this whole other
life I didn't know about.

22:12.166 --> 22:15.834
They split up, but he
wanted
to get his son back.

22:15.917 --> 22:18.709
He still needed her
to bring him over.

22:18.792 --> 22:20.917
Not what I signed up for.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.000
That's when I knew it was over.

22:27.250 --> 22:29.041
Alright.

22:30.166 --> 22:31.333
Ahem.

22:31.417 --> 22:35.583
Agent Scarcelli's faxing me
Piedad's INS file.

22:35.667 --> 22:37.750
Maybe shed some light
on what happened in Cuba

22:37.834 --> 22:39.667
between Piedad and Gonzalo.

22:40.250 --> 22:41.667
They broke up.

22:41.750 --> 22:43.208
He must have been a pretty
convincing guy

22:43.291 --> 22:46.417
get her to chaperone his son
across the Florida Straits.

22:46.500 --> 22:49.041
Still a ticket out of Cuba.

22:49.125 --> 22:52.667
No, ahem, can't say I blame her.

22:54.083 --> 22:55.291
You ever been?

22:56.667 --> 22:57.959
Nope.

22:58.041 --> 22:59.750
Don't you wanna see it
before there's a
Starbucks

22:59.834 --> 23:01.709
on every corner?

23:01.792 --> 23:03.083
I'll leave that to the tourists

23:03.166 --> 23:05.625
and hipsters sporting
Che T-shirts.

23:07.750 --> 23:10.333
(Scotty)
I know too much
about what happens there

23:10.417 --> 23:13.625
to sip mimosas
poolside in Havana.

23:17.792 --> 23:21.500
Got something?

23:21.583 --> 23:24.291
Lemme see Gonzalo's
immigration file.

23:29.583 --> 23:31.250
Sunburned and blistered.

23:32.583 --> 23:37.375
Look like she spent a week
at sea the way Gonzalo did?

23:37.458 --> 23:39.667
Not on a raft, she didn't.

23:39.750 --> 23:43.000
More like an overnight
speedboat ride,
point-to-point.

23:44.667 --> 23:48.208
Divorce wasn't the only thing
Piedad was lying about.

23:55.750 --> 23:58.208
How was it you got
to America, Piedad?

23:58.291 --> 23:59.917
I told you already.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.125
Also told us
you were married to
Gonzalo.

24:02.208 --> 24:04.458
Failed to mention that you
filed for divorce back in
Cuba.

24:04.542 --> 24:07.583
Neighborhood spies
were watching us.

24:08.750 --> 24:10.750
The divorce made it
easier for us to
escape.

24:10.834 --> 24:13.333
Or maybe you were pissed
off
'cause he ditched you.

24:13.417 --> 24:16.500
Came to America, got rich,
and dipped into who knows what?

24:16.583 --> 24:17.834
No.

24:17.917 --> 24:20.250
When Gonzalo got suspended
from baseball in Cuba

24:20.333 --> 24:23.208
it destroyed him.
He had to leave.

24:23.291 --> 24:26.625
But you divorced him
after he defected.

24:26.709 --> 24:28.917
I had no choice.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.583
When Gonzalo came to America,
the government threatened

24:31.667 --> 24:34.208
to take our house.

24:34.291 --> 24:36.542
I was protecting Andres.

24:36.625 --> 24:38.667
Divorce meant survival.

24:38.750 --> 24:40.709
We're trying to solve
your husband's murder

24:40.792 --> 24:43.375
but you keep lying to us.

24:43.458 --> 24:46.458
(Nick)
'You look pretty good for
just
coming off a raft, Piedad.'

24:46.542 --> 24:49.667
If you tell us again how you
brought your two-year-old

24:49.750 --> 24:51.959
on a 90-mile raft trip

24:52.041 --> 24:53.166
Andres is gonna come home

24:53.250 --> 24:56.208
to see his mom
being hauled away in cuffs.

24:56.291 --> 25:00.208
- I was afraid.
- Of what?

25:00.291 --> 25:02.875
The man who brought us here.

25:21.458 --> 25:22.917
Gonzalo.

25:54.208 --> 25:55.291
Hello?

25:55.375 --> 25:57.583
(Gonzalo over phone)
'Hello?'

25:59.208 --> 26:00.959
Gonzalo went to see this man.

26:01.041 --> 26:02.792
In Miami?

26:02.875 --> 26:05.542
No. He was in Philadelphia.

26:05.625 --> 26:07.208
He arranged the whole thing?

26:07.291 --> 26:08.667
Yes.

26:08.750 --> 26:11.375
You think this man
killed your husband?

26:11.458 --> 26:12.333
Yes.

26:12.417 --> 26:14.208
We need a name, Piedad.

26:16.834 --> 26:19.250
All I have is my son.

26:19.333 --> 26:20.959
They already took Gonzalo.

26:21.041 --> 26:22.792
- You want to be safe?
- Yes.

26:22.875 --> 26:26.166
You make this right and tell
us
who did this to Gonzalo.

26:31.750 --> 26:34.375
The men called him "Oz".

26:35.083 --> 26:37.667
That's all I know.

26:41.709 --> 26:43.125
(Nick)
Oz into
recycling?

26:43.208 --> 26:44.542
(Kat)
Nope.

26:44.625 --> 26:47.417
(Kat)
But an old CI of mine is.
Goes by "Clifford".

26:47.500 --> 26:48.667
(Nick)
As in big red dog?

26:48.750 --> 26:50.333
(Kat)
As in white boy with dreads.

26:50.417 --> 26:51.583
(Kat)
Guy's a walking
Ghetto Pages

26:51.667 --> 26:54.125
of the illegal
import/export biz in Philly.

26:54.208 --> 26:55.834
(Nick)
He collect cans on the
side?

26:55.917 --> 26:58.083
(Kat)
Sells to the addicts after
they
get their returnable money.

26:58.166 --> 26:59.667
Enterprising.

26:59.750 --> 27:01.583
Yo, Clifford!

27:11.500 --> 27:13.417
Hey.

27:18.458 --> 27:19.917
(Clifford)
They try to do me
like Rodney King!

27:20.000 --> 27:21.041
(Kat)
Shut it,
Clifford.

27:22.667 --> 27:24.125
If I stroke out
the last thing I'm gonna do

27:24.208 --> 27:25.333
is shoot your dumb ass!

27:25.417 --> 27:27.875
Yo, blue, I ain't holding.

27:27.959 --> 27:30.291
That's good 'cause we
need a name, Clifford.

27:31.959 --> 27:33.667
Oh, snap!

27:33.750 --> 27:36.917
You looking tight, baby girl.
Didn't know it was you.

27:37.000 --> 27:38.875
Call me "baby girl" again.

27:38.959 --> 27:41.542
I apologize for matriculating.

27:42.375 --> 27:43.583
Clifford is at your service.

27:43.667 --> 27:46.333
The guy's name is Oz.
You heard of him?

27:47.709 --> 27:49.583
You trying to see the Wizard?
Why didn't ya say so?

28:04.750 --> 28:06.333
Here to see the Wizard.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.625
Grab the rack.

28:09.125 --> 28:10.250
Come on.

28:10.333 --> 28:12.417
Osmany Leon.

28:12.500 --> 28:14.125
(Scotty)
Take a walk.

28:17.166 --> 28:19.792
Come on. Sit down.

28:19.875 --> 28:20.875
<i>Cafecito?</i>

28:20.959 --> 28:22.917
We're here about Gonzalo Luque.

28:23.000 --> 28:25.208
You smuggled his family
out of Cuba.

28:28.333 --> 28:29.583
I don't even own a boat.

28:29.667 --> 28:33.667
Fence, import/export
contraband, 'cause I'm guessing

28:33.750 --> 28:35.625
fluff n' fold ain't
the only thing you're into.

28:35.709 --> 28:37.542
I'm a legitimate businessman.

28:37.625 --> 28:38.834
I'm a member of the
Chamber of Commerce.

28:38.917 --> 28:41.250
And representing what,
the Lollipop Guild?

28:41.333 --> 28:43.667
They hate to disrupt
your business here, Osmany.

28:43.750 --> 28:46.291
Screw up your cash flow,
ding your name on the street.

28:46.375 --> 28:49.750
You gonna shut me down? Okay.

28:49.834 --> 28:52.917
Or you could tell us why you
held Gonzalo's wife and kid

28:53.000 --> 28:56.500
in a motel room in Miami
till he came up with more
cash.

28:59.208 --> 29:01.458
It's important to give
back to the community.

29:02.458 --> 29:04.417
(Osmany)
Reunite
families.

29:04.500 --> 29:06.667
Long as they pay
the freight charge.

29:06.750 --> 29:10.875
Sounds like Gonzalo
had a problem paying up.

29:10.959 --> 29:13.041
Bishop to D4.

29:13.125 --> 29:14.792
(Lilly)
'Mate in two.'

29:17.166 --> 29:19.000
(Osmany)
Huh.

29:22.542 --> 29:23.709
Nice.

29:23.792 --> 29:25.917
Calling in the cavalry.
Have 'em toss this place.

29:27.166 --> 29:31.542
Gonzalo Luque and I
had mutual
interests.

29:31.625 --> 29:36.583
He wanted to get his family back
and I wanted to send a message.

29:42.166 --> 29:44.583
<i>Tranquilo.</i>
- I did what I was told.

29:44.667 --> 29:47.917
Paid my money, and now
you tell me there was a
problem?

29:48.000 --> 29:49.750
Mm-hmm.

29:49.834 --> 29:52.625
These are the people
<i>friend</i>

29:52.709 --> 29:54.166
arranged for me to pick up.

29:55.208 --> 29:56.375
Piedad and Andres.

29:56.458 --> 29:58.083
And..

29:59.458 --> 30:01.875
No, no, no.
Where are my parents?

30:01.959 --> 30:02.917
You know those two?

30:03.000 --> 30:04.041
Teammates back in Cuba.

30:05.792 --> 30:09.000
Look, this is a mistake.
I pay for my family!

30:09.083 --> 30:12.291
That's right.
40,000 was the family
discount.

30:12.375 --> 30:14.208
Ballplayers are a premium.

30:14.291 --> 30:15.917
Reyes never told me
about these players!

30:16.000 --> 30:18.291
Well, that makes
two of us,
Gonzalo.

30:18.375 --> 30:20.917
You tell Reyes
I need another
40K.

30:21.000 --> 30:22.542
<i>Desgraciado!</i>

30:22.625 --> 30:27.166
Oyeme,
you get your wife and son
back.

30:27.250 --> 30:30.083
The rest is between
you and your agent.

30:30.166 --> 30:33.375
buenos noches,

30:42.667 --> 30:47.000
Gonzalo wanted to be
reunited with his family.

30:47.083 --> 30:48.583
I respect that.

30:48.667 --> 30:50.583
But Gonzalo thought
Reyes was gonna get

30:50.667 --> 30:52.208
his entire family over.

30:52.291 --> 30:54.750
We were both being gamed.

30:54.834 --> 30:56.166
Reyes come up
with the money?

30:56.250 --> 30:59.125
That same night.
And I kept my word.

30:59.208 --> 31:02.083
I released
Gonzalo's wife and son.

31:02.166 --> 31:04.041
Who were these players?

31:06.834 --> 31:09.750
I like to look
at the box
scores.

31:12.750 --> 31:16.041
(Osmany)
Lots of interesting
information.

31:18.041 --> 31:19.834
Some big names.

31:21.750 --> 31:23.792
Gonzalo go to see Reyes?

31:25.375 --> 31:27.041
Wouldn't you?

31:34.208 --> 31:36.083
(Jaime)
Come over if you want,
but the only thing you need

31:36.166 --> 31:37.625
to worry about is
that I've got..

31:37.709 --> 31:39.375
oye, oye!
middle
of something here.

31:39.458 --> 31:41.291
Yeah, you were.

31:41.375 --> 31:43.250
This guy takes a whole
lot more than ten percent.

31:43.333 --> 31:46.417
Please! Butch, give me
five minutes, okay?

31:47.667 --> 31:51.333
Signed for six and
eight million a
piece.

31:52.750 --> 31:54.959
- That's a tidy commission.
- They were worth it.

31:55.041 --> 31:57.917
Worth having Gonzalo's
wife
and kid held for ransom?

31:58.000 --> 31:59.500
That's it.
I'm calling my attorney.

31:59.583 --> 32:01.417
Why? Only thing you need
to worry about right now

32:01.500 --> 32:02.792
is immigration violations.

32:02.875 --> 32:04.709
(John)
But we'll leave that up
to the feds, huh?

32:04.792 --> 32:07.333
Unless you killed him.

32:07.417 --> 32:10.500
Look, Gonzalo wanted
his family here.

32:10.583 --> 32:12.500
I said to him that
I was gonna take care of it.

32:12.583 --> 32:14.500
I didn't want him getting
mixed up in that mess.

32:14.583 --> 32:16.291
Oh, you mixed him up real good

32:16.375 --> 32:18.333
but you couldn't fool
the great and powerful
Oz.

32:18.417 --> 32:19.834
I was gonna fix it.

32:19.917 --> 32:22.667
By stealing Gonzalo's money
to smuggle players out of Cuba?

32:22.750 --> 32:26.208
Big league talent. Can see why
you wanted those players so
bad.

32:26.291 --> 32:29.834
Baseball players are
a prized possession to Castro.

32:29.917 --> 32:33.000
By liberating them, I stick
it to that bearded bastard.

32:33.083 --> 32:34.875
You're a real freedom fighter.

32:34.959 --> 32:37.542
Using Gonzalo's account
to stake your little
empire.

32:37.625 --> 32:40.083
Only one problem, Reyes.
You got caught.

32:40.166 --> 32:41.875
I didn't kill Gonzalo.

32:41.959 --> 32:44.208
But he wanted to kill me.

32:45.000 --> 32:46.291
I trusted you, Jaime.

32:46.375 --> 32:47.917
You're looking at
this the wrong
way.

32:48.000 --> 32:50.375
How else am I supposed
to look at it, huh?

32:50.458 --> 32:52.125
My wife and son are
being held hostage

32:52.208 --> 32:53.542
and my parents are
still in Cuba.

32:53.625 --> 32:56.333
Don't worry about
it.
We'll get 'em out.

32:56.417 --> 32:57.417
And I'm gonna cut
you in on the
deal.

32:57.500 --> 33:00.250
Wrong. I'm cutting you out.

33:00.333 --> 33:02.208
You fix this,
and then we're done.

33:02.291 --> 33:04.542
(Jaime)
'Come on, Gonzalo.
Gonzalo, don't.'

33:04.625 --> 33:06.875
(Jaime)
'Come on, Gonzalo.
I got a scout coming.'

33:06.959 --> 33:09.041
He's gonna try out your cousin.

33:09.125 --> 33:10.917
We're gonna make it work!

33:12.834 --> 33:15.208
I tried to tell Gonzalo,
but he didn't wanna hear it.

33:15.291 --> 33:17.500
I put the money back
in his account.

33:17.583 --> 33:19.625
His cousin Juan, what did
he have to do with this?

33:19.709 --> 33:22.542
Juan was the first Cuban
player
I ever tried to contact.

33:22.625 --> 33:26.291
His fastball used to
top off at 95-plus.

33:26.375 --> 33:28.959
- His change-up was a
decleater.
- Used to?

33:29.041 --> 33:32.125
Yeah, by the time he came
over, the guy had lost it.

33:32.917 --> 33:35.041
But Gonzalo idolized Juan.

33:37.291 --> 33:38.917
Quick hands.

33:39.792 --> 33:41.250
Nice.

33:41.333 --> 33:43.792
Checked out Juan's story.
Got some major holes.

33:43.875 --> 33:45.417
Starting with his
immigration file.

33:45.500 --> 33:48.625
Turns out,
Juan was on Gonzalo's
raft.

33:49.750 --> 33:51.083
Wet-foot, dry-foot.

33:51.166 --> 33:53.250
Gonzalo reaches dry land, stays.

33:53.333 --> 33:54.750
Juan gets
arrested
in the water

33:54.834 --> 33:56.083
sent back to
Cuba
the same day.

33:56.166 --> 33:58.417
Mm. Bet you that
was a warm homecoming.

33:58.500 --> 34:01.583
Sixteen months later,
Juan takes another
raft.

34:01.667 --> 34:02.750
Lands on Key Largo.

34:02.834 --> 34:04.333
Picked up along
with
five other rafters

34:04.417 --> 34:06.417
begging for water at a tiki bar.

34:06.500 --> 34:09.750
That and Juan's alibi has got as
many holes as our softball team.

34:13.458 --> 34:14.959
Where'd you say
you were working again?

34:15.041 --> 34:17.959
- The day Gonzalo was killed?
- Uh, Liberty Towers.

34:18.041 --> 34:20.250
- Construction and security.
- We spoke to your boss.

34:20.333 --> 34:23.125
Said you were working
a jobsite off Lancaster Ave.

34:23.208 --> 34:26.000
Next to the lot
where Gonzalo was killed.

34:28.375 --> 34:29.834
You think I killed him?

34:29.917 --> 34:31.583
Gonzalito was like
my little brother.

34:31.667 --> 34:35.750
You didn't play just a
"little"
ball in Cuba, either, Juan.

34:35.834 --> 34:38.917
You played with your
cousin
in the Cuban League.

34:39.000 --> 34:41.792
(Scotty)
<i>Industriales.</i>

34:41.875 --> 34:43.750
What did they call you?

34:46.083 --> 34:48.417
<i>"El Canon".</i>
- Mm. The cannon.

34:48.500 --> 34:50.500
Must have had
a hell of a fastball.

34:50.583 --> 34:54.667
Till you and Gonzalo were
banned from playing in Cuba.

34:54.750 --> 34:56.834
You were with Gonzalo
on that raft.

34:56.917 --> 35:00.750
Gonzalo made it
to dry land. You didn't.

35:00.834 --> 35:04.792
Got your repatriation
order from
immigration.

35:04.875 --> 35:07.959
April 6, 1998.

35:08.041 --> 35:10.041
Gonzalo got to stay.

35:10.125 --> 35:11.250
They sent you back.

35:21.709 --> 35:24.041
(Lilly)
'You went back
to Cuba a traitor.'

35:24.125 --> 35:26.709
And they threw
you
in prison, Juan.

35:32.625 --> 35:33.959
Ahem..

35:35.500 --> 35:39.208
(Scotty)
This is my grandfather
and his older brother.

35:39.291 --> 35:41.333
(Scotty)
'The Revolution split 'em
up.'

35:41.417 --> 35:44.667
One to Philly,
the other to Castro's jails.

35:46.125 --> 35:48.041
Decades go by.

35:48.125 --> 35:52.333
My grandfather gets word
from Cuba his brother's dead.

35:52.417 --> 35:56.875
A month later
abuelo's

35:58.792 --> 35:59.709
From what?

35:59.792 --> 36:01.709
A heart attack.

36:01.792 --> 36:05.125
My father, working stiff said

36:06.208 --> 36:10.250
"His heart didn't stop.

36:10.333 --> 36:11.583
It broke."

36:13.333 --> 36:16.959
What happens in Cuba
stays with us.

36:19.041 --> 36:21.458
(Scotty)
'I know what they do to
traitors in prison, Juan.'

36:22.417 --> 36:24.792
Ballplayers?

36:24.875 --> 36:27.041
They cripple 'em.

36:27.125 --> 36:31.083
Put you back out on the street
as a warning to the others.

36:42.834 --> 36:46.542
It isn't just a
game,
is it, Juan?

36:49.625 --> 36:53.375
If I would have just made it
that day, on the beach..

36:53.458 --> 36:56.709
You'd be playing
baseball right
now.

36:56.792 --> 36:59.166
Gonzalo would still be alive.

37:00.208 --> 37:04.000
All this time,
we couldn't figure out

37:04.083 --> 37:06.458
why his body was moved
from that sandlot.

37:06.542 --> 37:10.458
And then we realized
Episcopal's
only a few blocks away.

37:11.959 --> 37:13.542
(Lilly)
'You went to get the car.'

37:13.625 --> 37:15.917
You were trying to get
your cousin to a hospital.

37:19.125 --> 37:21.291
I was trying to save him.

37:21.375 --> 37:23.583
We know you didn't mean
to hurt your cousin.

37:25.583 --> 37:28.542
You just...lost control.

37:30.709 --> 37:32.500
<i>Oyeme..</i>

37:32.583 --> 37:35.333
We're trying to
help you here, Juan.

37:41.500 --> 37:44.458
[sobbing]
He didn't make it.

37:59.166 --> 38:01.375
(Gonzalo)
Eso, eso!

38:01.458 --> 38:04.417
Canon

38:04.500 --> 38:07.041
I heard the cannon from the
car,
and I had to hit something!

38:07.125 --> 38:08.333
What happened?

38:10.625 --> 38:12.333
- In Miami?
<i>Si.</i>

38:14.041 --> 38:16.000
(Gonazalo)
'No. Reyes screwed me.'

38:16.083 --> 38:17.375
That son of a bitch.

38:17.458 --> 38:19.542
He gave my parents' spots
to a couple of ballplayers.

38:23.542 --> 38:26.500
He thought I was stupid, but
I
took care of it, got rid of
him.

38:26.583 --> 38:27.875
You did what?

38:27.959 --> 38:31.375
[speaking Spanish]
I fired him.

38:31.458 --> 38:33.500
Reyes was gonna get me a tryout.

38:33.583 --> 38:35.000
- Scouts were gonna--
<i>Hermano.</i>

38:35.083 --> 38:37.333
I'll get you
the tryout and scouts.

39:22.417 --> 39:25.166
- It's just that you don't
know.
- Don't know what?

39:25.250 --> 39:28.125
You don't know what
they did to me over there.

39:31.542 --> 39:32.917
I'll pitch to you, eh?

39:33.000 --> 39:35.333
- Hey, man, Juan, man.

39:43.709 --> 39:45.792
Don't worry about it, huh?

39:45.875 --> 39:46.959
I'll take care of it, alright?

My parents?

39:53.709 --> 39:55.375
Primo,

39:55.458 --> 39:57.500
If it wasn't for me,
you wouldn't even be
here.

39:57.583 --> 39:58.792
Juan, what are you
talking about?

40:00.583 --> 40:02.208

be okay now--

40:13.417 --> 40:16.625
