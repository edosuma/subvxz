WEBVTT

00:09.217 --> 00:10.968
Let's fucking get
it on right now. Let's go.

00:11.136 --> 00:15.556
Come on. Come on.

00:15.724 --> 00:17.391
Here. Here.

00:17.559 --> 00:20.602
Now, I want to go over a few rules
with y'all tonight.

00:20.770 --> 00:23.522
Ain't that all right?
Don't worry about it. Rule number one.

00:23.690 --> 00:26.483
This is the
"What can you touch and not touch" rules.

00:26.735 --> 00:31.905
Can you touch this?

00:33.491 --> 00:36.326
No, no, no.

00:37.245 --> 00:38.829
Second touch.

00:39.914 --> 00:45.210
Can you touch this?

00:45.378 --> 00:48.422
No, no, no.

00:49.257 --> 00:50.549
And finally....

00:51.926 --> 00:55.637
Last one, ladies. Can you touch this?

00:56.431 --> 00:58.849
Can you ever touch this?

01:00.268 --> 01:03.187
Well, that's who the law says
that you cannot touch.

01:04.897 --> 01:08.233
But I think I see a lot of lawbreakers
up in this house tonight.

01:10.695 --> 01:13.113
And I don't see a cop in sight.

01:13.281 --> 01:14.490
All right?

01:21.498 --> 01:22.539
Oh.

01:24.000 --> 01:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:47.440 --> 01:50.150
You know, I gotta go commando today
because someone...

01:50.401 --> 01:53.195
...ripped off my favorite pair
of panties last night.

01:54.864 --> 01:57.241
- Hey. It's not funny.
- Heh, oh, sorry, heh.

01:57.408 --> 02:00.244
- They were my grandma's.
- They were not your grandma's.

02:00.411 --> 02:01.453
They could have been.

02:01.621 --> 02:05.332
Can you throw me, uh,
that shirt right there?

02:05.500 --> 02:07.918
Hey, what are we gonna do about her?

02:08.211 --> 02:09.877
I don't know.

02:10.045 --> 02:11.421
What was her name again?

02:11.589 --> 02:13.799
What? I don't...

02:13.967 --> 02:15.968
I'm sorry. What's her name?

02:16.803 --> 02:17.970
Uh.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.221
You don't even know.

02:19.389 --> 02:21.306
- I do.
- You found her. You have to remember her.

02:21.516 --> 02:23.392
- I know her name.
- What is it, then?

02:23.560 --> 02:25.018
It's....

02:25.478 --> 02:27.229
Penelope.

02:30.024 --> 02:31.900
Whatever her name was, she was fun.

02:32.068 --> 02:33.944
That's a cool table. Where'd you get it?

02:34.195 --> 02:37.781
That's just some old shit that blew
up on a beach after the last hurricane.

02:37.949 --> 02:39.616
- You made that?
- Hmm?

02:39.784 --> 02:40.993
You should sell these things.

02:41.161 --> 02:45.831
Tsk, thank you. That's actually the idea.
Mike's Custom Furniture Concepts.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.167
But the market hasn't really hit
the sweet spot yet.

02:48.334 --> 02:52.504
Hm, I'm waiting for the bank to make
the competitive loans I'm looking for...

02:52.672 --> 02:54.464
...and then I'll swoop in.

02:54.883 --> 02:56.133
Cool.

02:56.718 --> 02:59.094
I'm going to get out of here.
You guys are good?

02:59.262 --> 03:01.638
What? You're just gonna leave us?

03:01.806 --> 03:06.476
Yeah. What, are you gonna steal a bunch
of my shit or something?

03:06.644 --> 03:09.605
Probably. That's what strangers do.

03:10.231 --> 03:13.650
- Don't do that... maybe?
- Okay.

03:13.818 --> 03:15.611
- Okay.
- Okay.

03:15.778 --> 03:17.279
So I'm going to see you again?

03:17.447 --> 03:20.949
Tsk, uh, yeah, probably.
I don't know. I'll, uh, call you.

03:24.913 --> 03:26.413
Bye.

04:32.021 --> 04:33.230
Where's George and the guys?

04:33.398 --> 04:36.733
They fucked me and took another gig
last minute. So I got these guys.

04:36.985 --> 04:38.068
Where'd you get them?

04:38.319 --> 04:41.113
Uh, you know, ah, industry referrals.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.532
- My dick. You got them off Craigslist?
- Heh.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.867
I can't have fucking union guys
around here...

04:46.035 --> 04:48.412
...barking about benefits and shit.
Give me a break.

04:48.579 --> 04:50.998
So, what am I supposed to do in there?

04:51.165 --> 04:54.167
- Hey, you Sol? Sal. Adam.
- Sal.

04:54.335 --> 04:58.005
Oh, Adam, how you doing? This is Mike.
You guys are gonna be working together.

04:58.172 --> 05:00.882
Give me a minute?
I want to straighten something out there.

05:01.050 --> 05:02.592
You can hop up there.

05:04.595 --> 05:07.014
- You gotta be fucking kidding me.
- What?

05:07.181 --> 05:08.849
He's wearing fucking tennis shoes.
He doesn't know...

05:09.017 --> 05:12.853
Ah, heh, do me a favor, go up there
and do it for 14 bucks an hour.

05:13.021 --> 05:14.896
I'm gonna do it for 20 bucks an hour.

05:16.232 --> 05:17.524
- I'll give you 18.
- Mm-mm.

05:17.692 --> 05:19.192
Don't fuck with me.
You're like my son.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.778
The son which you're gonna pay
$20 an hour.

05:37.337 --> 05:39.004
What's up?

05:44.218 --> 05:46.678
You ever, uh, tiled a roof before?

05:47.055 --> 05:49.181
- No.
- Fuck.

05:50.224 --> 05:52.392
How'd you get this job, anyways?

05:52.560 --> 05:54.061
Craigslist.

05:55.063 --> 05:57.731
And you put on your post
that you'd tiled houses before?

05:57.899 --> 05:59.274
Yeah.

05:59.734 --> 06:00.776
Right, ugh.

06:00.943 --> 06:02.861
So, what do you got in your bag?

06:04.447 --> 06:06.782
- Why don't you open it up?
- There's nothing in it.

06:06.949 --> 06:10.160
Why don't you open the fucking bag
before I open your fucking head up?

06:13.748 --> 06:17.751
I got a nice ham, cheese sandwich....

06:18.169 --> 06:20.462
You know how to read, huh?

06:20.630 --> 06:22.964
One Pepsi a day. Read the cooler.

06:23.132 --> 06:27.511
I'm gonna do my inventory. If I come
up short, I'm coming right to you.

06:32.266 --> 06:33.600
Is it dead?

06:33.935 --> 06:35.102
What's that?

06:35.520 --> 06:38.855
I can try to jump you off if you want,
but it's not the battery.

06:39.774 --> 06:42.609
I think you're probably fucked.

06:42.777 --> 06:45.737
Just tell them if they
want to get into this...

06:45.905 --> 06:48.573
...be up there. I'll see you at the Amp.
All right. Later.

06:50.618 --> 06:53.620
What are you doing? Stop. What the fuck
are you doing, man?

06:54.956 --> 06:56.081
Sorry.

06:56.249 --> 07:00.210
It's new. It's gonna stay new
if you don't rip off the damn plastic.

07:00.378 --> 07:01.711
Why do you have that?

07:01.879 --> 07:05.298
Because it protects it. I'm going to
rip it off when I'm ready to sell it.

07:05.466 --> 07:06.842
It'll be like brand-new.

07:11.556 --> 07:12.973
Where are you from?

07:14.225 --> 07:15.767
Citrus Springs.

07:16.978 --> 07:18.645
Did you play ball?

07:19.564 --> 07:21.648
Uh, yeah. Strong safety.

07:23.568 --> 07:25.569
You don't look like a strong safety.

07:26.320 --> 07:32.492
I gave that, uh, college thing the college try.
Didn't quite work out.

07:35.329 --> 07:38.290
Couldn't resist the lure
of the roofing business?

07:38.458 --> 07:40.834
Yeah, that and the lure
of my sister's couch.

07:48.509 --> 07:52.137
Can you do me a favor and drop me
off at my car tonight?

07:52.305 --> 07:54.556
No, I'm sorry. I'm going to dinner.

07:54.724 --> 07:58.351
I can take you tomorrow morning, though.
What time do you have to be at work?

07:58.519 --> 08:02.522
I need to talk to you about that, heh.
The foreman, uh...

08:03.024 --> 08:06.860
...he accused me of stealing.
So I fucking quit.

08:07.028 --> 08:08.487
- What?
- Yeah, but I have....

08:08.654 --> 08:11.698
Well, I had that interview at T-Mobile.

08:11.866 --> 08:15.702
So, uh, yeah. They asked me to wear
a fucking tie.

08:15.870 --> 08:18.705
You know how I feel about wearing
a fucking tie.

08:20.124 --> 08:21.875
Why don't you just wear a tie?

08:23.794 --> 08:25.378
Sorry. You know what my rules are.

08:25.546 --> 08:26.838
Oh, God, brother.

08:28.216 --> 08:29.508
What? I also...

08:30.843 --> 08:31.843
...could do....

08:33.386 --> 08:34.679
- What?
- What?

08:34.847 --> 08:36.765
- What did you say?
- What did you hear?

08:38.726 --> 08:40.977
You're doing that thing.
You're doing that game.

08:41.145 --> 08:43.063
- What game?
- No. You do that all the time.

08:43.231 --> 08:44.397
It's not working anymore.

08:44.565 --> 08:46.983
- Talking about games, I could be a gamer.
- Oh, yeah.

08:47.151 --> 08:49.861
- And I could sell it to people.
- You'll make so much money.

08:50.029 --> 08:52.239
- I could be the voice of the game.
- Even more money.

08:52.406 --> 08:55.033
I have a very good voice.
I do great impressions.

08:55.201 --> 08:58.203
You do do good impressions.
What was the one you did last night?

08:58.371 --> 09:01.498
- I'm not going to do it now.
- Heh, do it again. Do it again.

09:01.666 --> 09:03.083
- No.
- Come on.

09:03.251 --> 09:04.251
Listen to me.

09:05.586 --> 09:06.878
These are my tortillas.

09:07.046 --> 09:10.006
Get in the chopper.
John Connor, come with me.

09:10.174 --> 09:12.801
- Argh!
- Okay. All right.

09:12.969 --> 09:16.179
In case that doesn't work out,
why don't you come to dinner with me...

09:16.347 --> 09:17.389
...and Paul tonight?

09:17.557 --> 09:20.392
You can ask him if any of his friends
have any job openings.

09:20.560 --> 09:23.728
But sometimes people want to, you know...

09:23.896 --> 09:29.651
...they think they're owed a lot more
than, uh, they deserve. So too bad. Bummer.

09:29.819 --> 09:32.529
Uh, but, uh, you know, whatever. Sucks.

09:32.697 --> 09:35.198
I just don't have to be the guy
that tells them, uh, you know...

09:35.366 --> 09:41.288
...that they're, uh, not going to be able
to rebuild their houses. Um, anyway....

09:41.455 --> 09:44.457
Uh, let's talk about something else,
you know.

09:44.625 --> 09:47.752
You're right.
I'm sick of talking about Medicaid...

09:47.920 --> 09:50.547
...and processing insurance forms as well.
I get it.

09:50.715 --> 09:51.923
- Right.
- I get it.

09:52.091 --> 09:55.635
Right. I mean, it's slightly different
when you're doing Medicaid claims...

09:55.803 --> 09:58.388
...and when you're doing huge
property damage claims...

09:58.556 --> 10:01.349
- ...but I guess it's a similar kind of thing.
- Yeah.

10:01.517 --> 10:03.310
Oh, wait, wait.

10:03.477 --> 10:06.271
- Remember what I said?
- Hmm, I'm so sorry.

10:06.439 --> 10:09.149
I just can't drive tonight.
I've been driving all weekend.

10:09.317 --> 10:10.358
I'm sorry.

10:10.526 --> 10:11.776
- No worries.
- I just forgot.

10:11.944 --> 10:14.029
Someone will finish it, I think.

10:14.196 --> 10:17.490
- There you go. There's a taker.
- I will.

10:19.201 --> 10:21.578
- Tsk.
- Good?

10:26.500 --> 10:28.084
Where are you going?

10:37.053 --> 10:39.179
Uh, hey,
do you know who's spinning tonight?

10:39.347 --> 10:41.181
Heh, uh....

10:41.349 --> 10:43.558
- No. Sorry.
- All right.

10:49.523 --> 10:50.857
Hey, Mike.

10:52.443 --> 10:53.526
Mike.

10:53.736 --> 10:55.195
Sorry, bro.

10:58.532 --> 10:59.866
Hey, Mike.

11:01.369 --> 11:02.869
- Hey, man.
- Yo.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.954
- Heh, what's going on?
- What's going on, bro?

11:05.122 --> 11:08.083
- Are you going in?
- Yeah, we're going.

11:08.250 --> 11:09.709
Can I come with you?

11:10.461 --> 11:12.003
Uh....

11:12.463 --> 11:15.548
Pfft, dude, they're never gonna
let you in like that.

11:16.217 --> 11:17.634
Come on. I'd do anything.

11:17.802 --> 11:20.679
Heh, it's not my fault.
I'm just saying they're not gonna do it.

11:20.846 --> 11:25.016
I would do it, but...
I don't think they're going to do it, bro.

11:25.184 --> 11:26.393
All right.

11:27.061 --> 11:28.228
All right?

11:29.897 --> 11:31.898
Fuck. Okay, dude. Hey.

11:32.441 --> 11:33.942
Um....

11:34.110 --> 11:35.860
You're going to owe me.

11:36.737 --> 11:38.321
- I promise, man...
- I mean, owe me.

11:38.489 --> 11:40.198
No questions asked, owe me.

11:40.366 --> 11:41.408
Anything.

11:41.575 --> 11:45.745
Take your hood off. Try to look a little
more... Tuck your fucking shirt in.

11:45.913 --> 11:48.081
You got to not wear tennis shoes, bro.

11:48.249 --> 11:51.918
George, dude, I got one.
I'm sorry. I know, I know.

11:52.086 --> 11:54.087
Thanks, bro. I owe you.

11:55.840 --> 11:59.092
Sorry, man. These are the only shoes I got.

12:07.601 --> 12:10.478
Hey, baby, mwah.
Can we borrow one of these?

12:10.646 --> 12:12.188
Thank you. Grab one.

12:12.356 --> 12:14.065
Is it free?

12:14.233 --> 12:16.526
Don't worry, man, you're gonna earn
your keep.

12:27.455 --> 12:29.456
So I got us a new recruit.

12:30.291 --> 12:32.792
Ladies, meet the Kid. Portia, Ruby.

12:32.960 --> 12:34.002
Hey.

12:34.170 --> 12:35.545
Heh, hey.

12:35.713 --> 12:37.881
What are we thinking? Yes, no, maybe?

12:38.132 --> 12:41.509
- Oh, yeah. The cougars will eat him up.
- Yeah?

12:41.677 --> 12:43.762
That's a quality endorsement, my friend.

12:43.929 --> 12:45.513
What do you guys do?

12:46.891 --> 12:48.725
- What?
- Come here. Come here.

12:48.893 --> 12:51.561
Any time a girl tells you
her name starts with a flower...

12:51.729 --> 12:54.355
...a car or a stone,
don't bother asking what she does.

12:54.523 --> 12:55.982
You know what I'm saying?

12:56.192 --> 12:59.736
All right, I ain't got that much time,
so I'm calling in my favor, all right?

12:59.904 --> 13:00.945
Okay.

13:01.113 --> 13:03.114
You see the girl with the tiara thing
and the sash?

13:04.617 --> 13:06.451
- Yeah.
- Go talk to her.

13:06.994 --> 13:08.369
What do you want me to say?

13:08.537 --> 13:11.956
I don't care. Have you never talked
to a girl before? Just go talk to her.

13:12.124 --> 13:13.208
Be creative.

13:13.375 --> 13:15.627
She does not look like she wants
to be bothered.

13:15.795 --> 13:18.963
Look at what she's wearing.
She came here tonight to be bothered.

13:19.131 --> 13:21.382
Go bother her.
You want to be inside or outside?

13:21.550 --> 13:22.592
Inside.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.011
I'll come save you in a minute.
Get out of here.

13:29.767 --> 13:33.561
I'm getting wasted tonight
if we could get a drink.

13:33.729 --> 13:34.771
I know.

13:34.939 --> 13:38.066
She's, like, ignoring the whole side
of this bar.

13:38.234 --> 13:39.484
- Hey.
- Hey, Carla.

13:39.652 --> 13:40.860
Um, oh....

13:41.028 --> 13:43.613
Yo, man. Watch out, you're going to knock
my girlfriend.

13:43.781 --> 13:46.533
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, what the fuck are you gonna do?

13:50.120 --> 13:53.081
- Uh, hi. Do I know you?
- Hi.

13:53.249 --> 13:54.290
Uh, no. I'm, uh...

13:54.458 --> 13:57.335
I didn't know that I had a boyfriend,
but thank you for that.

13:57.503 --> 13:59.963
Um, all the guys here
are fucking obnoxious.

14:00.130 --> 14:01.548
- Thanks for that.
- Heh.

14:01.715 --> 14:04.175
Who do we have to fuck
to get a fucking drink?

14:04.343 --> 14:06.010
Uh, me, please?

14:06.178 --> 14:08.304
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?
- Uh, yes, I would.

14:08.472 --> 14:12.809
We've been standing around here
for quite a while, and I'm 21.

14:12.977 --> 14:14.686
- It's true.
- And I can't get drunk.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.020
- You're 21?
- Yes.

14:16.188 --> 14:18.857
Happy 21st. I'd buy you guys a shot if I...

14:19.024 --> 14:20.817
- Don't worry about it.
- It's fine.

14:21.068 --> 14:22.193
Oh, Adam.

14:22.361 --> 14:23.528
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.363
- I'm Liz. Hi.
- Hi, Liz.

14:25.531 --> 14:27.407
What do you say, baby boy?
You want one?

14:27.575 --> 14:30.034
I can't find anybody to take
these. Y'all want them?

14:30.202 --> 14:32.662
- Perfect. We can't drink them all ourselves.
- Whoo.

14:32.830 --> 14:37.917
Uh, here's to, um, our children.
May they have rich fucking parents, heh.

14:38.085 --> 14:39.878
Heh, absolutely.

14:42.923 --> 14:45.091
- Yes. Okay.
- Whoo.

14:45.259 --> 14:47.677
- What, you guys go to USF?
- Yeah.

14:47.845 --> 14:49.762
- Mm-hm.
- So it's summer break, correct?

14:49.930 --> 14:51.347
- That's right.
- Whoo.

14:51.515 --> 14:53.224
And if I'm not mistaken,
that says "21," right?

14:53.392 --> 14:54.434
I am 21, yes.

14:54.602 --> 14:56.436
- Then why the fuck isn't she throwing up?
- Whoo.

14:56.604 --> 14:57.645
- We can't get drinks.
- Ha, ha.

14:57.813 --> 15:01.232
You can't get drinks? That's no excuse.
That's a bad friend you got.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.610
I'm not a bad friend.

15:03.777 --> 15:05.987
- You are a bad friend.
- I'm trying.

15:06.155 --> 15:07.280
You are a bad friend.

15:07.448 --> 15:09.574
See? You heard it from her.
I'm just saying.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.784
- What are you guys planning on doing tonight?
- Ha, ha.

15:11.952 --> 15:13.161
Wouldn't you like to know?

15:13.329 --> 15:15.330
- Actually, I would, to be totally honest.
- Ha, ha.

15:15.497 --> 15:19.334
If you like to get a wee bit crazy,
why don't you come down and see the show?

15:23.380 --> 15:26.049
- Are you serious? Wow.
- As a fucking heart attack.

15:26.216 --> 15:28.468
We have a lot of friends here.
Can they come too?

15:28.636 --> 15:29.844
- How many?
- Eight or nine?

15:30.012 --> 15:31.179
That's perfect, actually.

15:31.347 --> 15:33.932
Hand them these. Tell them
they get in free at the door.

15:34.099 --> 15:35.350
Okay. Maybe we'll come.

15:35.517 --> 15:37.310
No. That's not a commitment.

15:37.478 --> 15:40.897
Maybe we'll come,
if your little friend here comes too.

15:41.065 --> 15:42.273
- Me?
- Oh, "little friend."

15:42.441 --> 15:44.484
That's an easy if,
because he will be there.

15:44.652 --> 15:46.486
- He's absolutely gonna be there.
- I will?

15:46.654 --> 15:47.946
Then we'll be there too.

15:48.113 --> 15:52.492
All right. The show starts in 45 minutes.
You can make it in 45 minutes?

15:52.660 --> 15:55.036
- You're going to come. You swear?
- Yeah, we promise.

15:55.829 --> 15:57.956
- Dude. You're a fucking stripper?
Ha-ha-ha.

15:58.123 --> 16:01.042
I swear, I thought you were going to shit
the bed, but you, heh, actually did it.

16:01.210 --> 16:03.836
Ah, I feel like I owe you.
I can throw you 100 bucks...

16:04.004 --> 16:05.838
...tip you out at the end of the night...

16:06.006 --> 16:08.341
- ...if you really want to host.
- Host what?

16:08.968 --> 16:11.219
Yeah. No, for sure.

16:14.682 --> 16:16.599
- I hope you're ready for this shit.
- Ha, ha.

16:24.274 --> 16:26.275
Who's your friend, Mike?

16:29.613 --> 16:32.198
- This is the owner. Jesus.
- Whoo.

16:32.366 --> 16:35.827
Fucking Valhalla shit, man, mwah.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.161
You see that shit, Mike?

16:37.329 --> 16:39.580
Chicks are gonna go fucking crazy
over this, man.

16:39.748 --> 16:42.917
I'm thinking of giving this routine
to Tarzan, unless you want it.

16:43.085 --> 16:46.921
No. It's not my style, but, uh,
somebody should do it. It's cool.

16:47.089 --> 16:48.715
- Oh, it's fucking really good, heh.
Mm-hm.

16:48.882 --> 16:50.091
Ah, who's this?

16:50.259 --> 16:53.636
This is the Kid. Uh, he wrangled, like,
nine sorority girls for us tonight...

16:53.804 --> 16:56.556
...so I figured
he could help out around here tonight.

16:56.724 --> 16:57.849
How old are you?

16:58.017 --> 16:59.350
- Uh, nineteen.
- Nineteen.

16:59.518 --> 17:02.854
- The fuck am I supposed to do with that?
- Oh, come on. He don't look 19.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.063
I can't have him host.

17:04.231 --> 17:06.398
Can't have a 19-year-old
on the fucking street.

17:06.567 --> 17:08.151
Then he can do props, can't he?

17:08.318 --> 17:11.194
- I can do anything.
- We're setting up our own shit as it is.

17:11.655 --> 17:12.821
All right. Props.

17:12.990 --> 17:14.406
You're on props tonight.

17:14.575 --> 17:17.201
Do whatever Mikey tells you,
any of the guys tell you.

17:17.368 --> 17:19.369
Clean the fucking toilets, whatever.

17:19.538 --> 17:21.789
Tonight. And listen up.

17:22.332 --> 17:24.125
- This is not a fucking joke.
- Heh.

17:24.292 --> 17:27.920
All right? It's not a fucking hobby.
This is a serious business I'm running.

17:28.088 --> 17:31.340
So the last thing I need is a teenage
liability fucking my future up.

17:31.508 --> 17:33.134
- Don't try it. Yeah.
- Capiche?

17:33.302 --> 17:36.596
One thing about Waffle House pussy
is you got to worry about the teeth.

17:36.764 --> 17:38.598
Waffle House pussy?
I hate Waffle House pussy, heh.

17:39.975 --> 17:42.101
Everybody, this is the Kid.
Y'all can thank me later.

17:42.269 --> 17:43.853
He's going to help us out tonight.

17:44.021 --> 17:46.397
This is Big Dick Richie, Ken, Tito
and Tarzan.

17:46.565 --> 17:47.607
Whoa, I get it.

17:47.775 --> 17:51.152
Just tell him what props you need.
I'll help him set them up later.

17:51.320 --> 17:54.781
And, uh, yeah. Have fun.
Make yourself at home, Kid.

17:55.115 --> 17:56.449
There you go, bro.

17:58.035 --> 17:59.077
- No, thanks, man.
- No?

17:59.244 --> 18:01.329
- No. I'm good.
- Suit yourself.

18:01.538 --> 18:03.998
You handed it to me like the Hindenburg.

18:04.166 --> 18:06.542
- How long you been on the force?
- What?

18:07.294 --> 18:09.921
The police. How long you been a cop?

18:10.089 --> 18:11.881
I'm not a cop, man.

18:12.549 --> 18:14.467
Ha, ha, just fucking with you. Sit down.

18:14.635 --> 18:16.344
Come on, man, sit down.

18:18.347 --> 18:19.931
So how do you know Mike?

18:20.099 --> 18:22.308
Uh, ahem.

18:22.810 --> 18:26.187
We, uh, worked together on construction.

18:30.484 --> 18:32.318
What kind of cash you make at that?

18:32.653 --> 18:33.694
You all right, man?

18:37.074 --> 18:38.491
What kind of cash you make?

18:38.659 --> 18:40.576
Like 10 bucks an hour.

18:40.744 --> 18:42.453
Under the table?

18:42.913 --> 18:44.038
Yeah.

18:44.206 --> 18:45.957
Hmm, not bad.

18:49.002 --> 18:51.212
So you're here to help us out?

18:52.005 --> 18:53.381
Yes, I am.

18:53.549 --> 18:57.385
All right, so we got your first
little piece of business... bam.

18:57.553 --> 18:59.178
That look ashy to you?

18:59.346 --> 19:01.764
- What's that, man?
- That look ashy?

19:01.932 --> 19:03.266
Heads up.

19:03.433 --> 19:07.353
Just give it a little... Just a
little spray on that calf there.

19:07.521 --> 19:08.855
Oh, come on.

19:09.022 --> 19:10.314
Come on.

19:10.482 --> 19:12.692
Dude, I don't want to spray your leg.

19:13.193 --> 19:14.569
Just do it.

19:14.736 --> 19:16.195
We all had to do it, man.

19:16.363 --> 19:19.824
It's like the initiation.
Lord of the Flies. Come on.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.409
Come on, Kid. It's all right.

19:21.577 --> 19:24.036
We'll tip you out good at the end
of the night. You'll be a happy man.

19:24.204 --> 19:26.956
- Uh.
- Make sure you massage it in good.

19:29.042 --> 19:30.918
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

19:35.716 --> 19:37.216
He fucking did it too.

19:38.719 --> 19:41.345
Oh, you're all right, man.
You're all right.

19:46.226 --> 19:49.145
Take this front-row
table right here, ladies.

19:50.397 --> 19:52.023
You got your ID on you?

19:52.191 --> 19:56.110
You got your ID? Heh. You're not drinking
a Shirley Temple tonight, are you?

19:56.278 --> 19:58.613
No. We've already had a few drinks, so....

19:58.780 --> 20:02.200
No Roy Rogers, no Shirley Temples.
Y'all have a great time.

20:02.367 --> 20:06.454
We do a group act first, then we do our
solos, then we do hot seats.

20:06.622 --> 20:09.332
If everything goes well
and we get these girls jacked up...

20:09.499 --> 20:12.585
...then we jack up the price of the
hot seats, so don't fuck it up.

20:12.753 --> 20:15.338
Dude, it's easy.
All you got to do is hand us...

20:15.505 --> 20:18.507
...our props before we go out on-stage.

20:18.675 --> 20:21.093
All right? That's it.
That's all you got to do.

20:21.261 --> 20:23.930
You bring out whatever props
and everything... There he is.

20:25.474 --> 20:27.975
This is Tobias. He is our resident DJ.

20:28.143 --> 20:30.102
Tobias, the Kid.
He's gonna be the one...

20:30.270 --> 20:32.313
...giving you the cue
before each act.

20:32.481 --> 20:35.441
- Pre-game. That's what I'm talking about.
- It's the love potion.

20:35.609 --> 20:38.736
- What is this? Strawberry?
- What is that?

20:38.904 --> 20:43.449
It's a little mixture.
In, uh, Miami, we call it Hey Juice.

20:43.617 --> 20:47.536
Hey Juice. Because if you drink the whole
bottle, "Hey." You'll like it, man.

20:48.872 --> 20:50.456
Give it a sample.

20:51.625 --> 20:53.626
You can't drink, so you want half a cap?

20:55.212 --> 20:56.837
I don't know what the fuck it is.

20:57.005 --> 21:01.634
It's just G. It's basically like
getting drunk without all the calories.

21:03.053 --> 21:05.054
- All right.
- You sure?

21:07.349 --> 21:10.643
All right, all right, all right.

21:12.729 --> 21:14.355
Whoo!

21:14.940 --> 21:17.692
Yeah.

21:17.859 --> 21:21.654
How are we feeling tonight, ladies?
Let me hear it one more time. Come on.

21:21.822 --> 21:26.283
It's gonna rain. Rain gonna come down
and cleanse our soul and wash away the ash.

21:26.451 --> 21:29.745
So get out your purses and get ready
to spend some motherfucking cash.

21:29.913 --> 21:31.998
Welcome to the stage,
the one, the only...

21:32.165 --> 21:35.084
...the Cock-rocking Kings of Tampa.

25:04.711 --> 25:08.130
Ooh, aah. Ooh, aah.

25:08.590 --> 25:10.716
Ooh, aah.

25:13.386 --> 25:15.054
Tarzan.

25:22.354 --> 25:24.396
Tarzan?

25:25.357 --> 25:26.774
Where the fuck is he?

25:28.568 --> 25:31.737
Motherfucker. What the fuck, man? Tarzan.

25:31.988 --> 25:33.113
Fuck, man.

25:33.281 --> 25:36.075
Motherfucker.
How many fucking times, huh?

25:38.078 --> 25:41.121
Ken, S&M routine. You up on that?
Can you do that?

25:41.289 --> 25:43.457
I'm not putting that out there.
Negative energy.

25:43.625 --> 25:44.875
Not putting what out there?

25:45.043 --> 25:47.086
The negative energy. It's bad.
It comes back.

25:47.254 --> 25:48.420
You're kidding me.

25:48.588 --> 25:51.715
Richie, the, uh, fire-breathing gig, huh?
You up for that?

25:51.883 --> 25:54.510
No. I got the fire-phobia issue.

25:56.680 --> 25:59.348
Tito. Anything, man.
South of the border fucking shit...

25:59.516 --> 26:00.849
...you've been doing at home.

26:01.017 --> 26:04.019
I'm working on something,
but it's not ready yet. It's not ready.

26:04.187 --> 26:05.604
All right.

26:05.772 --> 26:07.815
We got to do something.
Mikey, what you got?

26:07.983 --> 26:10.818
- I just came off-stage. I can't.
- An idea. Give me something.

26:10.986 --> 26:14.822
- You go out then.
- I'm not hitting the fucking floor. Come on.

26:15.282 --> 26:17.700
- You want me to come up with something?
- Fuck, yeah.

26:20.870 --> 26:24.248
I hope you can dance.
You still owe me. Come on.

26:30.630 --> 26:33.382
Just start taking
your clothes off. Walk out there.

26:33.550 --> 26:35.801
What are you looking at Dallas for?
Don't. Look at them.

26:37.637 --> 26:38.971
Just start, bro.

26:39.139 --> 26:41.306
Yeah, perfect, perfect. Go, go, go.

26:47.647 --> 26:49.565
There you go.

27:19.137 --> 27:20.512
Whoo!

27:56.883 --> 27:59.134
All right, all right, all right.

27:59.636 --> 28:03.013
Let's give it up for the Kid.
Popped his cherry on-stage tonight.

28:03.181 --> 28:05.641
You know what time it is.
It's time for the hot seat.

28:05.809 --> 28:07.768
You know what that means,
the orgy's over, ladies.

28:07.936 --> 28:09.978
Time for some one-on-one time
with the man of your dreams.

28:11.106 --> 28:13.732
- Five dollars a pop.
- Come here.

28:13.900 --> 28:16.527
That's good.
Welcome to the crazy club, Kid.

28:16.694 --> 28:20.114
Come on. Everybody.
Line up, line up, line up.

28:20.281 --> 28:23.200
Yeah, man. Whose big dick is that?

28:23.368 --> 28:24.368
Whoo.

28:25.370 --> 28:29.873
- I love it.
- Hey, where's the Kid? Kid. Kid.

28:30.041 --> 28:32.793
Look at this saggy underwearing,
all-star right here.

28:32.961 --> 28:34.461
Go buy yourself fresh drawers.

28:34.629 --> 28:37.172
He put that kiss on her and
pouring money out of their hands.

28:37.340 --> 28:40.884
Aaah!

28:41.052 --> 28:44.888
Never kiss the girls, Kid.
That's Performer 101.

28:45.056 --> 28:46.682
You gotta watch out for herpes.

28:46.850 --> 28:47.891
That too.

28:48.059 --> 28:51.728
But tonight you took a chance
and it paid off. I like that.

28:51.938 --> 28:53.438
Fucking worked.

28:53.606 --> 28:54.648
I got you your money.

28:54.816 --> 28:56.984
That ain't my money, big boy.
That's your money.

28:57.152 --> 28:59.528
Every man keeps every dollar
he makes on that stage.

28:59.696 --> 29:03.115
Plus the 50 that I owe you. All right?

29:03.283 --> 29:06.952
Look, get ready to work, big boy.
It ain't gonna be that easy every time.

29:07.120 --> 29:09.955
- Yes, sir.
- Fucking worked, whoo!

29:10.123 --> 29:11.999
Ho!

29:12.167 --> 29:15.085
Ken, nice fucking robot.

29:15.253 --> 29:19.715
Mike lays it out. Tito bringing in
the south side with some brown skin.

29:19.883 --> 29:22.676
Big Dick, they are still devastated
by your cock.

29:22.844 --> 29:25.637
It was loke 25 percent dancong,
50 percent marketing.

29:26.431 --> 29:28.682
- What...?
- Eh, Mike sold it up real nice.

29:28.850 --> 29:32.352
How about you're forgetting 25 percent
more genius?

29:32.520 --> 29:35.022
- Genius, Kid.
- How we do tonight, Mikey?

29:35.190 --> 29:40.319
Uh, it's a little under $2500.
Uh, that's 400 better than last week.

29:40.486 --> 29:41.653
That'll work.

29:41.821 --> 29:45.157
- And my, uh, cut of the door.
- Yes, sir.

29:45.325 --> 29:47.367
That was dangerous shit
you pulled tonight...

29:47.535 --> 29:49.494
...throwing that kid out
on the plank like that.

29:51.122 --> 29:52.789
It worked though, didn't it?

29:52.957 --> 29:55.000
Shit. I didn't know if it was,
till he hit the floor.

29:56.628 --> 29:58.879
- He pulled it out.
- Yeah. What's his story?

29:59.047 --> 30:01.673
I don't know. I mean, I met him
at the site today.

30:01.841 --> 30:05.928
Ran into him at Ybor.
Those two little pretty ones over there...

30:07.263 --> 30:10.265
...were all hot and bothered,
so I figured I'd bring him along.

30:10.433 --> 30:12.768
It was a good move, heh.

30:12.936 --> 30:16.021
He may have something, brother.
He's young, good-looking....

30:16.189 --> 30:19.483
- He can't dance for shit.
- Cannot dance for shit, that is teachable.

30:19.651 --> 30:22.402
We could use some more youth
on the team.

30:22.570 --> 30:25.989
Why don't you bring him to practice
tomorrow and we'll see what he's got?

30:26.157 --> 30:28.533
So, what the fuck is going on with Miami?

30:28.701 --> 30:31.411
Miami, ah, is looking good.

30:31.579 --> 30:33.830
I got a couple loopholes
I got to get through...

30:33.998 --> 30:35.582
...with the, uh, real-estate attorneys.

30:35.750 --> 30:37.918
But after that it's gonna
be all green lights.

30:38.086 --> 30:41.546
- What you need from me? What's my side?
- Just keep doing what you're doing.

30:41.714 --> 30:43.840
I love where your head's at.
You're focused.

30:44.008 --> 30:46.260
You're like a big brother
to this team.

30:46.427 --> 30:49.263
Keep that up, you could be making
a lot more than door money.

30:49.430 --> 30:50.764
I guarantee you that.

30:50.932 --> 30:52.641
Both ways this time, though, right?

30:52.809 --> 30:55.477
- Two-way street.
- I want to hear you say the word: Equity.

30:55.645 --> 30:56.853
E-Q-...
- Say it.

30:57.021 --> 30:59.564
...-U-I-T-Y.
- Say it.

32:56.933 --> 32:58.642
Oh.

32:58.810 --> 33:00.185
- Hey, Mike.
- Huh?

33:00.520 --> 33:02.187
I think, uh....

33:03.189 --> 33:05.524
I think we should be best friends.

33:06.359 --> 33:07.651
Okay, heh.

33:09.028 --> 33:10.404
Let's go, heh.

33:17.912 --> 33:20.080
So how pregnant
did you get that girl's mouth?

33:20.248 --> 33:21.581
Uh, wet? Heh.

33:28.548 --> 33:30.215
Fucking great.

33:34.554 --> 33:35.887
Good morning.

33:36.139 --> 33:37.556
- Hi, sis.
- Hi.

33:37.723 --> 33:41.518
- Brooke, this is Mike, uh....
- Oh, thank you. Mike, this is Brooke.

33:41.686 --> 33:44.020
- Brooke. Absolute pleasure. Hi.
- Mike.

33:44.188 --> 33:45.856
Are you a nurse?

33:46.023 --> 33:49.484
I'm a medical assistant.
I process nurses' paperwork.

33:49.652 --> 33:50.694
Way cooler.

33:50.862 --> 33:52.904
Sure. Sure.

33:54.240 --> 33:59.870
Oh, nice, dude. Is this one of those retro
Wakefield, or is this a Russel Wright?

34:00.830 --> 34:04.249
Oh, it's a knock-off. That's cool, though.
Where did you get this?

34:04.417 --> 34:06.835
Uh, apparently the knock-off place.

34:07.003 --> 34:08.420
Heh, right.

34:09.088 --> 34:12.215
- So how do you know my brother?
- Uh, he's on my roofing crew.

34:12.382 --> 34:16.636
But I'm, uh, an entrepreneur, though.
I, uh, manage a few businesses.

34:17.346 --> 34:18.597
Sure.

34:19.098 --> 34:21.558
Sure, cool. Cool.

34:25.605 --> 34:27.688
So the Kid said something
about breakfast.

34:27.857 --> 34:32.068
Uh, well, he must be fucking drunk
because I don't cook no fucking breakfast.

34:32.612 --> 34:38.116
I wasn't talking about you cooking it.
He just said you like breakfast food.

34:39.284 --> 34:41.786
We were going to swing by IHOP
on the way...

34:42.871 --> 34:44.498
Okay uh, good talk.

34:44.665 --> 34:48.918
Um, I'll be outside with the rest
of the breakfast lovers of the world.

34:52.215 --> 34:53.340
All right, Kid.

34:53.507 --> 34:55.217
Virgin dance the other night. No more.

34:55.384 --> 34:57.260
You only have a cherry pop one time.

34:57.428 --> 35:01.348
Now look, you walked out on-stage,
you looked like shit, all right?

35:01.516 --> 35:03.683
When I saw something
is when you got off-stage.

35:03.851 --> 35:05.519
Pulled a one-on-one with that chick.

35:05.686 --> 35:08.772
I'll show you what you're gonna do.
Now, let's go to the basics.

35:08.940 --> 35:09.981
Take your clothes off.

35:10.149 --> 35:11.858
- Right now?
- Right now. Take them off.

35:12.026 --> 35:14.027
Every fucking one of them. Let's go.

35:14.487 --> 35:16.780
Let's go. Take them off.

35:17.990 --> 35:19.866
- Heh.
- Hang on. What the fuck are you doing?

35:20.034 --> 35:22.202
Heh, what are you, a 12-year-old
in the locker room?

35:22.370 --> 35:23.411
No.

35:23.579 --> 35:25.830
- Then what are you doing?
- Heh, taking off my clothes.

35:25.998 --> 35:28.291
You're taking off your clothes
like a 12-year-old.

35:28.459 --> 35:31.545
But you're not a 12-year-old
in the locker room. You are the man.

35:31.712 --> 35:34.589
On the stage. Thousands of women.

35:34.757 --> 35:37.801
Eyes on you. You are their vision.
So, what do you do?

35:37.969 --> 35:42.347
You don't just fucking throw your clothes off.
You fucking make it count, baby.

35:42.515 --> 35:45.350
You walk out. You own it.

35:45.601 --> 35:48.853
You look around. You tease.

35:49.355 --> 35:51.022
You seduce.

35:52.525 --> 35:55.193
Clock eyes,
but don't lock in on any of them.

35:55.861 --> 36:00.532
You got to believe that you are inside
every single one of them.

36:00.700 --> 36:04.494
And when the time's right,
then you'll know it.

36:05.121 --> 36:06.663
Foom!

36:06.831 --> 36:12.335
Stick it. That right there is like
hitting the G-spot, every single time.

36:12.503 --> 36:14.212
Now get up there, move around.

36:14.380 --> 36:16.840
You see, baby, you're not just stripping.

36:17.008 --> 36:21.219
You are fulfilling every woman's
wildest fantasies. All right?

36:21.387 --> 36:24.097
You are the husband that they never had.

36:24.265 --> 36:27.142
You are that dreamboat guy
that never came along.

36:27.310 --> 36:30.687
You are the one-night stand,
that free fling of a fuck...

36:30.855 --> 36:34.733
...they get to have, tonight, with you
on-stage, still go home to their hubby...

36:34.900 --> 36:36.234
...and not get in trouble...

36:36.402 --> 36:40.155
...because you, baby, you made it legal.
You are the liberation.

36:40.323 --> 36:42.824
Own it. Who's got the cock?
You do, they don't.

36:42.992 --> 36:44.784
Get right here. Move slow. Around.

36:44.952 --> 36:46.453
Fucking concentrate.

36:46.621 --> 36:49.497
Round, round, round.
Make this shit count.

36:49.665 --> 36:53.043
Ain't time for a fucking fag joke
in here, boy. I'm talking about money.

36:53.210 --> 36:56.254
Move around, round, round.
Get the movements. Breathe.

36:56.422 --> 36:59.257
All right. Easy, rattlesnake.

36:59.425 --> 37:01.217
On three, you're going to stick it.

37:01.385 --> 37:05.055
One, two, three, stick.

37:05.348 --> 37:07.515
That's the hook, baby.
That's the fucking hook.

37:07.683 --> 37:10.352
That's what I'm talking about.
All right?

37:13.356 --> 37:15.690
You can do this, because I know you can.

37:15.941 --> 37:17.651
- I can do it.
- Now, take a breath.

37:20.112 --> 37:21.780
Fuck that mirror like you mean it.

37:21.947 --> 37:25.116
"All right, all right, all right.

37:25.451 --> 37:28.203
Heh, we got the Kid coming up
on the main stage." Hi, Beatrice.

37:28.371 --> 37:33.083
Are you ready? Dallas gave me the go-ahead
on getting you suited up. You ready?

37:33.250 --> 37:34.501
Yeah.

37:34.669 --> 37:36.086
Why do you look scared for?

37:36.253 --> 37:40.048
You already lost your virginity.
All you got to do now is get good at it.

37:40.216 --> 37:43.259
We got to get you an American flag
Star-Spangled Banner...

37:43.427 --> 37:45.970
...for Fourth of July summertime.

37:46.639 --> 37:48.973
Dude. This has no back.

37:49.725 --> 37:52.852
Yeah. That's the point. It's a thong.

37:55.690 --> 37:56.731
What the fuck is this?

37:58.067 --> 38:00.360
Stay away from the elephant socks, bro.
That's Dallas shit.

38:00.528 --> 38:02.654
You don't want to look like him, do you?

38:02.822 --> 38:05.824
What's Dallas's deal, man?
Is he, uh, a good guy?

38:06.492 --> 38:09.828
Yeah. Dallas is.... Dallas is Dallas.

38:11.080 --> 38:13.415
I mean, it's pretty cool that he let me in.

38:13.999 --> 38:16.835
Yeah. It's cool that he let you in.

38:17.002 --> 38:18.837
Look, we think you got something.

38:19.088 --> 38:20.797
I'm not exactly sure
what that is just yet...

38:20.965 --> 38:25.927
...but, uh, all we know is you got a lot of work to do.
So don't quit your day job yet.

38:58.753 --> 38:59.919
Adam.

39:01.088 --> 39:03.673
- Get out here. I need to talk to you.
- What do you want?

39:03.841 --> 39:06.426
I want to talk to you, man.
Get the fuck out.

39:07.595 --> 39:10.930
- Get out, Adam.
- I'll be out in a minute, please. One sec.

39:11.182 --> 39:13.767
Adam, I need to fucking talk to you.

39:14.268 --> 39:15.310
What about?

39:15.478 --> 39:19.939
Um, About this box.
I need to talk to you about this box...

39:20.274 --> 39:22.066
Oh, fuck me.

39:22.234 --> 39:26.488
...of boots and thongs and sailor hats
and tube socks. And I am fucking...

39:26.655 --> 39:28.448
It's for work.

39:28.699 --> 39:31.451
For work? Adam, don't
fucking lie to me, man.

39:31.619 --> 39:34.537
I'm your sister. I love you.
I don't judge you.

39:34.705 --> 39:38.124
You're my brother. Just please come out
here so I can talk to you.

39:38.292 --> 39:40.418
I don't care what your preferences are.

39:40.586 --> 39:42.837
- Preferences?
- I just want to talk to you about...

39:43.005 --> 39:44.464
Whoa, hey.

39:44.632 --> 39:46.633
It is not what it looks like.

39:47.635 --> 39:49.302
Is that my razor?

39:49.804 --> 39:50.970
Yeah.

39:52.807 --> 39:54.808
Are you shaving your fucking legs?

39:55.810 --> 39:57.227
Yeah, I'm shaving my legs.

39:57.394 --> 39:58.978
Why are you shaving your legs?

39:59.146 --> 40:00.438
It's for work. Okay?

40:00.606 --> 40:03.942
What do you mean, it's for work?
How could it possibly be for work?

41:07.673 --> 41:10.174
Ma'am, excuse me.
You're going to have to move it down.

41:10.342 --> 41:13.303
This is the breakfast lovers' section.
Here we go.

41:13.470 --> 41:14.721
Hi, Mike.

41:15.055 --> 41:16.931
- Hi.
- Hi.

41:17.725 --> 41:20.101
Entrepreneur/stripper?
Stripper/entrepreneur?

41:21.896 --> 41:24.689
Either one. It's fine.

41:25.316 --> 41:27.609
You really just came down
to see little brother?

41:27.776 --> 41:30.069
No, I was hoping this was all a joke.

41:31.488 --> 41:33.364
It is pretty funny.

41:38.412 --> 41:40.413
You better take care of him, Mike.

41:44.251 --> 41:45.752
Okay, Mom.

41:46.921 --> 41:49.672
I'll take care of him.
You should stick around, though.

42:03.437 --> 42:07.273
All right, all right.
Let's give it up for the Kid, huh?

42:08.442 --> 42:11.986
Bang. A six-shooter for you. There we go.

42:14.114 --> 42:16.783
This next performer who's coming out...

42:17.785 --> 42:19.911
...he's one of a kind, ladies.

42:21.664 --> 42:24.832
I saw this young man walking down
the street about six years ago...

42:25.000 --> 42:28.378
...and I knew when I saw him,
I just knew I had to bring him in.

42:29.129 --> 42:33.591
Bring him in and have his talents
be shown to the universe.

42:34.301 --> 42:37.011
And tonight, he's going to be right here
on this stage...

42:37.179 --> 42:39.305
...so you can see with your very own eyes.

42:40.307 --> 42:42.809
Our feature presentation,
the one and only...

42:43.477 --> 42:47.522
...the star of the show, Mr. Magic Mike.

45:09.790 --> 45:11.290
Did you see your sister tonight?

45:11.542 --> 45:13.626
- See my sister? What do you mean?
- Yeah.

45:13.794 --> 45:15.378
Your sister was there.

45:16.046 --> 45:17.630
No, she wasn't.

45:17.798 --> 45:20.466
Yeah, she was there during your act.

45:20.634 --> 45:22.093
You talked to my sister?

45:22.261 --> 45:25.596
I talked to your sister as you were
dry-humping a girl, yes.

45:25.764 --> 45:27.723
My sister saw me dance?

45:27.891 --> 45:30.643
Heh, yeah, we were actually laughing.
I had a pretty good laugh about it.

45:30.811 --> 45:34.063
- Oh, heh, wow. Fuck.
- Ha, ha.

45:34.231 --> 45:36.524
She did not look happy.
Did you tell her to come?

45:36.692 --> 45:39.235
I told her. I didn't think
she'd fucking come. Jeez.

45:39.403 --> 45:44.240
Well, she did. I don't know how long
she stayed for, but it was, uh....

45:44.992 --> 45:49.495
- She, ha, ha, looked pissed.
- Ha, ha, oof.

45:49.663 --> 45:51.497
How much money did you make tonight?

45:51.748 --> 45:53.499
- How much money?
- Yeah.

45:54.334 --> 45:55.835
Like 230.

45:56.003 --> 45:57.336
Two-thirty? That's good, man.

45:57.504 --> 46:01.465
Oh, by the way, I got this for you.
Uh, just for gas and shit.

46:01.633 --> 46:03.092
- Get the...
- Ha, ha.

46:03.260 --> 46:05.428
Are you kidding me?
Keep your money. It's fine.

46:05.596 --> 46:07.889
- You drive me around.
- I can pay for my own gas.

46:08.056 --> 46:11.893
It's fine. Thank you, though. It was a
really sweet gesture. I appreciate it.

46:12.060 --> 46:13.185
Thank you.

46:34.041 --> 46:35.791
That's a beautiful necklace.

46:35.959 --> 46:37.710
- Is that vintage?
- Oh, I, um....

46:37.878 --> 46:40.379
No, it's.... No, it's, heh....

46:40.714 --> 46:44.258
My sister got it for me, ha, ha
from Target, I think.

46:44.426 --> 46:48.638
Um, tsk, SBA, yes, uh....

46:48.805 --> 46:50.097
Name and Social.

46:50.265 --> 46:52.516
Absolutely. Michael Lane.

46:52.684 --> 46:58.064
038-00-7128. And I, uh...

46:58.982 --> 47:01.275
...brought the funds
for my down payment.

47:05.238 --> 47:08.616
- Yes. Yeah, heh.
- Heh.

47:08.784 --> 47:10.701
Okay.

47:16.750 --> 47:18.084
All right.

47:19.086 --> 47:24.465
We seem to have a credit issue, Mr. Lane.
Your score is...

47:24.633 --> 47:26.384
Right. I, uh, actually...

47:26.551 --> 47:28.844
- ...heh, I talked to Mr. Rodriguez last week.
- Oh.

47:29.012 --> 47:33.766
As I was explaining to him, the businesses
that I manage deal exclusively in cash.

47:33.934 --> 47:37.812
He said you would forego the credit check
if I brought in a healthy down payment.

47:37.980 --> 47:40.940
It should be noted in there.
He said he was going to put it in.

47:41.108 --> 47:42.692
Absolutely.

47:46.863 --> 47:51.283
Um, you are currently the manager
of an automotive accessories business?

47:51.451 --> 47:56.706
Mm-hm, absolutely. And an event-management
company, a roofing firm, heh.

47:56.873 --> 47:59.250
Honestly, the list goes on.

47:59.418 --> 48:02.712
- Wow, you're a busy guy.
- Ha, ha. Yeah.

48:02.879 --> 48:04.505
Lucky to be.

48:05.632 --> 48:07.883
So, what kind of rates am I looking at?

48:13.807 --> 48:18.811
There are ways to clear these credit issues
up over time, but...

48:18.979 --> 48:23.399
Oh, my God, I haven't even told you, heh,
what I'm here for. I really apologize.

48:23.567 --> 48:25.901
This is what I do.

48:26.069 --> 48:28.821
Right here.
Michael Lane Custom Furniture Concepts.

48:28.989 --> 48:31.782
It's competitive pricing. Low overhead.

48:31.950 --> 48:36.120
I mean, really, who wants to buy
that crap when it falls apart in a year...

48:36.288 --> 48:40.332
...when you can get hand-crafted furniture
for a bargain?

48:42.669 --> 48:45.421
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

48:51.678 --> 48:55.806
Unfortunately, Mr. Lane,
my hands are tied.

48:57.017 --> 49:00.728
The company has a policy
that we cannot issue loans...

49:00.896 --> 49:03.439
...to clients who score below
our credit threshold.

49:03.607 --> 49:07.151
I can absolutely understand
where you're coming from.

49:07.319 --> 49:10.821
Uh, you know, you hit buttons and you think
that you know something about me.

49:10.989 --> 49:12.823
I get it. That's okay. It's okay.

49:12.991 --> 49:16.619
All, uh, I'm asking for is a good deal.

49:17.370 --> 49:19.914
Please, can you help me with that?

49:22.042 --> 49:25.086
I mean, we do offer relief programs...

49:25.253 --> 49:28.839
...for our qualified distressed clients,
so that...

49:29.007 --> 49:30.800
I'm sorry. What?

49:30.967 --> 49:32.676
It's a relief program, so...

49:32.844 --> 49:35.262
Distressed? I'm distressed?

49:35.430 --> 49:37.264
- No. No, not like that.
- Heh.

49:37.432 --> 49:40.976
Sweetheart, listen. It's okay. It's fine.
Does this look distressed?

49:41.144 --> 49:45.022
I don't think so, one.
Two, I read the papers, okay?

49:45.190 --> 49:47.608
The only thing's that distressed is y'all.

49:59.579 --> 50:01.580
You can't get the door?

50:08.130 --> 50:11.841
Happy birthday

50:12.175 --> 50:14.510
Mrs. Pres...

50:17.013 --> 50:18.597
Oh.

50:18.765 --> 50:20.307
Adam, it's for you.

50:20.475 --> 50:22.518
Happy, heh, Birthday, heh, pfft.

50:22.686 --> 50:25.521
Ha, ha. Come on. Let's go. Sandbar party.

50:25.689 --> 50:29.275
Fourth of July, nuts-on-your-head
wake-up call, let's go. Come on.

50:29.442 --> 50:31.861
No, no, no. You are coming too.
Don't even try.

50:32.863 --> 50:35.781
I'm going to go to bed.
It's 7 in the morning.

50:35.949 --> 50:37.950
"Oh, it's 7 in the morning.
I hate fun."

50:38.118 --> 50:40.119
Jesus Christ, you better have
some epic plans...

50:40.328 --> 50:42.705
...if you're gonna turn your back
on a sandbar party.

51:34.841 --> 51:36.508
What did I tell you?

51:37.844 --> 51:39.178
- Paradise.
- Heh.

51:39.429 --> 51:44.308
Yeah. Paradise. Marooned on an island
with all the strippers in Tampa.

51:44.476 --> 51:47.895
How did I get so lucky?
The best Fourth of July ever, heh.

51:48.438 --> 51:49.939
I literally was just thinking...

51:50.106 --> 51:52.858
- ...that in my head, like just now.
- Ha, ha.

51:53.526 --> 51:55.194
Get out of my head.

51:57.030 --> 51:59.573
- Oh, shit. Yo.
- Hey.

51:59.741 --> 52:03.285
- What are you doing here?
- You know me. Always making new friends.

52:03.536 --> 52:05.454
- Good to see you.
- You too. How are you?

52:05.622 --> 52:07.748
I'm good. Uh, this is, um, Brooke.

52:07.916 --> 52:08.958
- Hi.
- Oh, hey.

52:09.125 --> 52:10.167
Brooke, uh, Joanna.

52:10.335 --> 52:12.503
- Nice to meet you.
- You too. I like your bikini.

52:12.671 --> 52:13.754
Thank you. You too.

52:13.922 --> 52:15.214
- Is that a tattoo?
- Yeah.

52:15.382 --> 52:16.840
What does it say?

52:17.008 --> 52:20.844
- Oh, uh, it just says I was 17, and....
- Ha, ha.

52:21.012 --> 52:22.221
Yeah.

52:22.389 --> 52:23.430
It's crazy.

52:23.598 --> 52:27.351
Yeah. Uh, so I know, uh, Joanna from the club.
Uh, she came up...

52:27.519 --> 52:29.770
She studied psychology
and she came up to do, uh....

52:29.938 --> 52:32.273
What's the thing you
came up to do?

52:32.440 --> 52:33.732
Behavior analysis.

52:33.900 --> 52:36.443
Right. She was analysizing our behavior,
apparently.

52:36.611 --> 52:38.821
That must have been, uh,
really enlightening.

52:38.989 --> 52:42.741
It actually was. You know, I go a few times
a week, if you want to come with us.

52:42.909 --> 52:44.868
She is actually the Kid's brother.

52:45.036 --> 52:46.412
I mean, sister.

52:46.579 --> 52:48.455
- Yeah, heh. Ha, ha.
- Right. Ahem.

52:48.623 --> 52:50.457
- Is that a tattoo over there too?
- Yeah.

52:50.625 --> 52:52.459
She has tattoos. You want a drink?

52:52.627 --> 52:53.711
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah?

52:53.878 --> 52:56.422
- It was nice to meet you.
- It was nice to meet you too.

52:58.425 --> 53:02.094
She's cute. What? I don't normally like
blonds, but she's really cute.

53:02.262 --> 53:05.180
Yeah, but she's not really our type.
You know what I'm saying?

53:05.348 --> 53:06.473
You're not into her?

53:06.641 --> 53:09.893
No, that's not what I'm saying.
I'm saying she's a little uptight.

53:10.061 --> 53:12.104
We're fucking her,
not taking her to dinner.

53:12.272 --> 53:13.314
It's not gonna happen.

53:13.481 --> 53:16.317
- She's a dinner type, is what I'm trying to say.
- Oh.

53:16.484 --> 53:19.695
Okay, if you decide you want to share...

53:20.030 --> 53:24.033
...and change your mind and put some
effort into it, you know my number.

53:24.200 --> 53:26.201
Besides, you know how much I love to eat.

53:26.369 --> 53:30.497
Yes, I will.
Obviously you don't like head.

53:42.135 --> 53:45.137
I started cheating in the seventh grade
just to entertain myself.

53:45.305 --> 53:48.057
Finished high school, but if I could do it
all over again...

53:48.224 --> 53:50.267
...I wouldn't have even gone. No way.

53:50.435 --> 53:52.311
You don't believe in school at all?

53:52.479 --> 53:54.104
I think fuck school altogether.

53:54.272 --> 53:57.107
When I have a kid,
I'm going to set him in front of the TV...

53:57.275 --> 54:00.944
...and make him watch Mad Money all day.
Teach him about the stock market.

54:01.112 --> 54:03.697
Get him into Ameritrade
and shit like that.

54:03.865 --> 54:07.826
I guarantee you by the time he's 18, that
little fucker's gonna be flush in cash.

54:07.994 --> 54:09.328
Boo-yah!
- Heh.

54:09.496 --> 54:12.206
- I don't know why more people
don't do that... DALLAS: Hm?

54:12.374 --> 54:14.208
...just from an investment standpoint.

54:14.376 --> 54:16.377
That's the state of the country, man.

54:16.544 --> 54:20.214
America. People. Stupid.

54:20.382 --> 54:21.965
I hope I get to meet your kids someday.

54:22.133 --> 54:23.425
Tsk, Oh, no problem.

54:23.593 --> 54:26.261
Come visit anytime
in one of our three cool houses, dear.

54:30.767 --> 54:33.894
Hey, if you want, I could probably
get Dallas' number for you.

54:34.062 --> 54:35.896
He's starting
this new life-coaching business...

54:37.273 --> 54:39.817
...that I really do think you might benefit
from personally.

54:39.984 --> 54:42.528
I mean, I saw the connection
between the two of you.

54:43.196 --> 54:44.863
What? I'm sorry.

54:45.448 --> 54:48.617
Right? So you felt it too?
What? Just, what?

54:48.785 --> 54:50.494
What would his kids even look like?

54:50.662 --> 54:53.872
They'd be running around
in little rattlesnake diapers and shit.

54:54.040 --> 54:55.541
Oh, no. Oh, no.

54:55.708 --> 54:59.044
Look, don't, uh, they just say stupid shit
sometimes. Don't let them bother you.

54:59.212 --> 55:00.587
Oh, no, it didn't bother me.

55:00.755 --> 55:04.675
I'm just trying to wrap my mind
around Adam and this whole mess.

55:04.843 --> 55:07.803
I get it. I don't know how
I fit into this whole mix, either.

55:08.054 --> 55:11.098
No. You... When you're on-stage,
it all makes sense.

55:11.266 --> 55:14.309
I mean, the way you dance
and the way the women respond to you....

55:14.477 --> 55:18.897
Wait a minute. So that means
someone might have stuck around.

55:19.732 --> 55:21.650
That's good to know.

55:22.402 --> 55:23.527
Yeah.

55:24.404 --> 55:28.574
That feeling.... That must be a really
crazy feeling to be on-stage...

55:28.908 --> 55:31.994
...like that. I see why you've been
doing it for so long. I get it.

55:32.162 --> 55:34.746
- But Adam's different. He's....
- Why is that?

55:34.914 --> 55:37.082
Well, he had a football scholarship.

55:37.750 --> 55:41.420
A year ago, he basically ruined it
by getting...

55:41.671 --> 55:45.507
...in a fistfight with his coach
in the first hour of the first day.

55:45.758 --> 55:48.844
- Yeah. I think he said something about that.
- Yeah.

55:49.512 --> 55:52.347
So I just don't...
I'm just trying to figure out...

55:53.099 --> 55:54.683
...why he's stripping.

55:54.851 --> 55:57.603
- "Why" is easy.
- What do you mean, it's easy?

55:57.770 --> 55:59.688
- You want some stripper wisdom?
- Okay.

55:59.856 --> 56:01.356
- You ready?
- Yeah.

56:01.524 --> 56:03.442
He's 19 years old.

56:04.944 --> 56:08.614
It's women, money and a good time.

56:10.783 --> 56:12.784
I guess. I guess.

56:13.786 --> 56:14.870
I got him.

56:16.539 --> 56:17.623
Okay?

56:18.625 --> 56:19.833
Okay.

56:20.585 --> 56:22.461
- You gonna come to the show tonight?
- No.

56:22.629 --> 56:23.712
- You're gonna come.
- No.

56:23.880 --> 56:27.049
- You just said you liked the show.
- Doesn't mean I'm gonna go again.

56:27.217 --> 56:29.676
- But you said...
- I'm not, heh, going. I've seen it.

56:29.886 --> 56:33.972
- Does that mean you were lying?
- I'm not lying.

56:57.455 --> 56:59.331
I do know and I've been told

56:59.499 --> 57:01.333
I do know and I've been told

57:01.501 --> 57:03.377
Big Dick Richie got a cock of gold

57:03.545 --> 57:04.962
Big Dick Richie got a cock of gold

57:05.129 --> 57:07.005
Now, let's give it up for the Virgin Kid

57:07.173 --> 57:08.882
Let's give it up for the Virgin Kid

57:09.050 --> 57:10.759
Anything you want, he won't forbid

57:10.927 --> 57:12.553
Anything you want, he won't forbid

57:12.720 --> 57:14.888
Now, Mikey got a pipe you gonna love

57:15.056 --> 57:16.682
Mikey's got a cock you know you gonna love

57:16.849 --> 57:18.600
What he got down low fits like a glove

57:18.768 --> 57:20.227
What he got down low fits like a glove

57:20.395 --> 57:21.603
Soldiers, sound off

57:21.771 --> 57:22.813
One, two

57:22.981 --> 57:24.523
- Sound off
Three, four

57:24.691 --> 57:29.278
One, two, three, four, one, two...
three, four

57:35.952 --> 57:38.203
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

58:29.505 --> 58:32.424
Oh, don't do that. Don't do that.

58:33.259 --> 58:36.011
I didn't... He did that himself.

58:36.179 --> 58:37.804
I'm bringing him home.

58:37.972 --> 58:39.097
Hey, brother bear.

58:40.767 --> 58:43.185
- Thank you.
- He's just stoned out of his mind.

58:43.353 --> 58:47.064
Heh, yeah, um, um....

58:48.441 --> 58:49.483
Hi.

58:49.651 --> 58:52.361
What's up, dude?
Yeah, we, we... My bad. We, uh....

58:52.528 --> 58:53.862
- Yeah.
- All right. I'll see you later.

58:54.030 --> 58:55.322
What's up, dude?

58:55.490 --> 58:56.782
Is that Paul?

58:56.949 --> 58:59.660
- Yeah. It's... Yeah.
- It is?

59:01.287 --> 59:05.749
- It's going good?
- Yeah, it's good. Just, heh, go on.

59:06.459 --> 59:09.711
Hey, I... uh, thanks.
Thanks for bringing him back.

59:09.879 --> 59:12.964
I told you I was going to take care of him,
didn't I?

59:13.132 --> 59:15.300
- Watch yourself.
- All right, heh.

01:00:09.021 --> 01:00:12.858
So, uh, I don't know,
how's school or whatever?

01:00:14.610 --> 01:00:19.865
Um.... It's good. It's good.

01:00:23.578 --> 01:00:25.662
I'm sorry,
what the fuck do you study again?

01:00:25.830 --> 01:00:28.039
Social studies, or sociology or....

01:00:28.207 --> 01:00:30.000
Heh, did you say "social studies"?

01:00:30.168 --> 01:00:31.585
Social science, heh?

01:00:31.753 --> 01:00:34.212
What, am I in middle school
or something, heh?

01:00:34.714 --> 01:00:36.006
No. No.

01:00:36.174 --> 01:00:38.842
- No?
- Psychology.

01:00:40.303 --> 01:00:44.389
So how much longer you got
in, uh, psychology?

01:00:45.975 --> 01:00:49.728
Uh, I have, uh, six weeks until I'm....

01:00:49.896 --> 01:00:51.313
- For real? Six weeks?
- Yeah.

01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:54.149
And then I'm a certified shrink.
Six weeks. That's right.

01:00:54.317 --> 01:00:58.653
- Wow.
- I know. People have to pay me now, heh.

01:00:59.155 --> 01:01:01.072
- That's huge.
- It is, yeah.

01:01:01.240 --> 01:01:04.326
I'm not paying you.
Not for these little visits, at least.

01:01:04.577 --> 01:01:06.912
I'd feel bad taking money from you.

01:01:07.079 --> 01:01:09.581
Heh, I'm too fucked up anyway, so....

01:01:09.749 --> 01:01:11.833
Oh, you're not so bad.

01:01:18.382 --> 01:01:19.800
So are you going to open up...?

01:01:19.967 --> 01:01:24.554
You ask a lot of questions, don't you?
Little Chatty Cathy tonight, huh?

01:01:24.722 --> 01:01:27.599
- Chatty Cathy.
- Chatty Cathy.

01:01:28.267 --> 01:01:30.602
And questions are off-limits, I guess?

01:01:30.770 --> 01:01:32.687
- They're always off-limits.
- Really?

01:01:32.855 --> 01:01:34.773
You don't need to talk. Just look pretty.

01:01:34.941 --> 01:01:38.193
What was your name?
I can't remember. What was it?

01:01:41.113 --> 01:01:44.950
Look, I'm going to go, okay?
Um, but I'll give you a call?

01:01:45.117 --> 01:01:46.660
Mm-hm.
- Mm-hm.

01:01:46.828 --> 01:01:48.662
Mm-hm.
- Okay.

01:01:48.830 --> 01:01:50.080
- Mm-hm.
Mm-hm, muah.

01:01:50.248 --> 01:01:51.498
Get out of here.

01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:44.235
That's what I'm saying. I'm....

01:03:44.612 --> 01:03:47.530
I'm looking at longevity. This is fun
for now, I'm not gonna be...

01:03:47.698 --> 01:03:51.284
...this young and beautiful forever.
Strip malls, I think I got a good idea.

01:03:51.535 --> 01:03:55.205
You know, and I watch all these people,
Carleton Sheets and these guys on TV.

01:03:55.373 --> 01:03:57.540
And I read this book called
Rich Dad, Poor Dad.

01:03:57.708 --> 01:03:59.376
- That's a great book.
- You read that?

01:03:59.543 --> 01:04:01.628
- I went to the convention.
- Yeah, uh, Robert Kiyosaki.

01:04:01.796 --> 01:04:03.380
- Kiyosaki.
- Yeah, that's the guy.

01:04:03.547 --> 01:04:04.798
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:04:05.257 --> 01:04:06.383
Heeey-ah!

01:04:06.550 --> 01:04:08.677
All right, all right, all right, hey, ah.

01:04:08.844 --> 01:04:11.429
If everybody can quiet down a second here.

01:04:11.681 --> 01:04:13.556
Quiet down a sec?

01:04:13.724 --> 01:04:16.559
Hey, everybody. Shut the fuck up.

01:04:17.269 --> 01:04:19.354
Richie, that's fucking microsuede, man.

01:04:19.522 --> 01:04:22.607
- Aw, shit. Sorry, bro.
- It's all right. Thanks.

01:04:23.275 --> 01:04:26.194
All right, now I got an announcement
to make.

01:04:26.362 --> 01:04:28.905
Now, that means you too, Tarzan.
Come on, big boy...

01:04:29.073 --> 01:04:31.825
...out of the shadows, into the light.
Come on, baby.

01:04:33.953 --> 01:04:37.455
I've been telling y'all this is going to be
a special night for a long time.

01:04:37.623 --> 01:04:39.666
Now I'm going to tell you why.

01:04:39.834 --> 01:04:43.294
Despite the hurricane
that has soiled our rather bountiful...

01:04:43.462 --> 01:04:44.838
...Saturday afternoon...

01:04:45.005 --> 01:04:47.757
...the good Lord has blessed
the Kings of Tampa this summer.

01:04:47.925 --> 01:04:49.300
Can I get an "amen" on that?

01:04:49.468 --> 01:04:51.553
- Yes.
- Amen.

01:04:52.471 --> 01:04:53.555
Mm.

01:04:54.724 --> 01:04:57.350
We've been talking a lot about the markets.

01:04:57.518 --> 01:04:59.436
Waiting for the sweet spot.

01:04:59.603 --> 01:05:03.440
Waiting for our time to make our move,
take our show global.

01:05:04.316 --> 01:05:06.776
Well, as of September 1 st...

01:05:06.944 --> 01:05:11.322
...we will no longer be
the Cock-rocking Kings of Tampa.

01:05:11.490 --> 01:05:12.991
No, sir, no, ma'am.

01:05:13.159 --> 01:05:17.036
We will be the Cock-rocking Kings...

01:05:17.204 --> 01:05:19.289
...of 4000 square feet...

01:05:19.457 --> 01:05:23.918
...of Miami prime-time beachfront
real estate, motherfuckers.

01:05:31.135 --> 01:05:34.137
Ah, Big Dick, keep it fucking hanging low.

01:05:34.305 --> 01:05:37.223
- Tito, call them Cubano cousins, huh?
- They on their way, baby.

01:05:37.391 --> 01:05:40.435
Kid, you ready for the big time, huh?
You ready for the big time?

01:05:40.603 --> 01:05:42.854
Tobias, you ready to take yourself
to the beach?

01:05:43.022 --> 01:05:44.522
I'm ready, man. I'm ready, huh.

01:05:44.690 --> 01:05:47.317
Ken, the housewives
are gonna love you down there.

01:05:47.485 --> 01:05:49.360
- We are blessed.
- They're gonna love you.

01:05:49.528 --> 01:05:52.822
Huh, Tarzan. Did you know they made trees
tall enough to swing from Tampa...

01:05:52.990 --> 01:05:55.658
...to motherfucking Miami, huh? Unh!

01:05:55.826 --> 01:05:58.411
Yeah. My main man.

01:05:58.579 --> 01:06:01.539
The moon is just a chip shot away,
brother, heh.

01:06:01.707 --> 01:06:03.792
A chip shot away. Fuck, yeah.

01:06:03.959 --> 01:06:06.544
I got to let it sink in, man.
We're really doing this?

01:06:06.796 --> 01:06:09.547
Oh, fuck, yeah, we're doing this, man.
This is our time.

01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:11.633
All right. All right.

01:06:11.801 --> 01:06:15.136
Listen, man. I couldn't even have dreamed
all this shit up without you.

01:06:15.304 --> 01:06:18.598
We're gonna do it together,
we're gonna do it just like we always said.

01:06:18.766 --> 01:06:22.477
- Seven-point-five across the board...
- You meant to say 10, didn't you?

01:06:24.063 --> 01:06:25.855
Congrats, Kid.

01:06:26.482 --> 01:06:27.899
Thanks, man.

01:06:28.067 --> 01:06:31.611
Heh, you know, if you ever want to go
in on a pack with me....

01:06:31.779 --> 01:06:34.906
Mike's not interested,
but we can go halfsies.

01:06:35.157 --> 01:06:36.950
I could make it worth your while.

01:06:37.117 --> 01:06:38.868
Yeah, sure.

01:06:41.622 --> 01:06:43.623
- I'll talk to you later about it, okay?
- Yeah.

01:06:56.595 --> 01:06:58.096
Who is that?

01:06:59.265 --> 01:07:00.431
Nora.

01:07:01.433 --> 01:07:03.768
I don't think you need
that in your life, bro.

01:07:32.882 --> 01:07:35.633
Heh, hey, baby girl, what are you doing?

01:07:35.801 --> 01:07:37.468
Huh?

01:07:37.636 --> 01:07:40.138
No, I'm at, uh... I don't
know, I'm at this party.

01:07:40.306 --> 01:07:42.390
It's getting lame.
I want to get out of here.

01:07:42.558 --> 01:07:46.561
How about I, uh, come scoop you up?
I can bring you a present.

01:07:47.479 --> 01:07:48.646
What?

01:07:48.898 --> 01:07:50.690
- What thing?
- Boom!

01:07:50.858 --> 01:07:52.567
I got a thing.

01:07:53.986 --> 01:07:55.862
Come on, you ain't...

01:07:56.989 --> 01:07:58.197
All right.

01:07:58.365 --> 01:08:01.242
Okay. All right, I'll call you later.

01:08:12.838 --> 01:08:14.505
This is Herman.

01:08:15.841 --> 01:08:17.175
Hi, Herman.

01:08:18.594 --> 01:08:20.261
He likes you.

01:08:31.857 --> 01:08:34.192
Hey, y'all. It's all right.

01:08:34.693 --> 01:08:35.859
Hey, man.

01:08:36.694 --> 01:08:38.529
We'd like to order.

01:08:39.740 --> 01:08:40.948
All right.

01:08:42.952 --> 01:08:45.411
- That pig is so fucking cute.
- Heh.

01:08:47.372 --> 01:08:49.207
Angels or demons?

01:08:49.707 --> 01:08:52.210
- Angels.
- Angels. Okay.

01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:58.049
- If you chew it, it'll hit you quicker.
- Heh.

01:09:00.219 --> 01:09:02.053
- You're gonna fucking love this one.
- Yeah.

01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:07.058
Yeah, fucking Miami, man.
Heh, fucking Miami.

01:09:13.983 --> 01:09:15.233
How you kids doing tonight?

01:09:15.484 --> 01:09:17.734
That storm is crazy, huh?

01:09:22.073 --> 01:09:24.533
- Beautiful.
- Mmm....

01:09:29.581 --> 01:09:31.749
My wife's tits are awesome, right?

01:09:31.917 --> 01:09:33.167
What?

01:09:33.335 --> 01:09:36.045
I said my wife's tits are awesome.

01:09:37.089 --> 01:09:38.464
Yeah.

01:09:41.093 --> 01:09:42.593
Check them out, man.

01:09:43.261 --> 01:09:46.805
- You fucking joking?
- I'm not fucking joking. Check them out.

01:09:47.933 --> 01:09:49.600
Feel them. They're so
fucking, heh, amazing.

01:09:52.438 --> 01:09:53.688
Come on.

01:09:56.442 --> 01:09:58.526
It's okay. Go ahead, man.

01:09:58.694 --> 01:10:00.903
- They're real, I swear.
- Yeah, I bet they are.

01:10:03.282 --> 01:10:04.615
See?

01:10:06.785 --> 01:10:08.286
- Heh.
- This is okay?

01:10:08.954 --> 01:10:12.165
It's okay with me, man. She loves it.

01:10:13.375 --> 01:10:15.209
I fucking love you.

01:10:15.377 --> 01:10:16.419
No, man, I love you.

01:10:16.587 --> 01:10:18.337
- You don't understand.
- I love you.

01:10:18.505 --> 01:10:20.256
No, I fucking....

01:10:20.424 --> 01:10:21.758
I fucking love you, man.

01:10:21.925 --> 01:10:25.011
I love you, man.
You're such a fucking special soul.

01:10:25.179 --> 01:10:26.637
I love you.

01:10:26.805 --> 01:10:28.890
I love you too.

01:10:43.489 --> 01:10:44.989
Is she even home?

01:10:48.327 --> 01:10:49.494
Brooke!

01:10:54.166 --> 01:10:55.500
Hi.

01:10:56.752 --> 01:10:58.086
What do you think?

01:10:58.587 --> 01:10:59.921
Is it yours?

01:11:00.172 --> 01:11:02.340
Is it mine? Fuck, yeah, it's mine.

01:11:03.675 --> 01:11:05.009
It's very you.

01:11:05.260 --> 01:11:07.428
Come on. Let's go.
We're going to celebrate.

01:11:07.679 --> 01:11:08.721
Come on.

01:11:08.889 --> 01:11:10.431
- Come on.
- Come on.

01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:14.811
Come on. Come here. Come on.

01:11:14.978 --> 01:11:17.313
- Are you calling me like a dog?
- What, huh?

01:11:17.481 --> 01:11:19.649
- Are you calling me like a dog?
- Who did that?

01:11:19.817 --> 01:11:21.317
You want me to say something to him?

01:11:21.485 --> 01:11:23.069
- Ha, ha.
- I'll say something to him.

01:11:23.237 --> 01:11:26.531
- Okay, so I've seen the stripping.
- Yup.

01:11:26.698 --> 01:11:28.783
Tell me about being an entrepreneur.

01:11:28.951 --> 01:11:31.953
It's "entrepreneur" actually.
It's, uh, French.

01:11:32.121 --> 01:11:35.123
You know about the roofing,
and I got a mobile-detailing thing.

01:11:35.290 --> 01:11:38.835
But the whole endgame is the custom
furniture business I'm trying to start.

01:11:39.002 --> 01:11:43.131
Custom furniture? So you must be really
good with your hands.

01:11:44.049 --> 01:11:46.467
- I did not say that.
- Yes, I did.

01:11:46.635 --> 01:11:49.637
But I'm glad you made that point.
It's very insightful, actually.

01:11:49.805 --> 01:11:51.722
- That's a lot of stuff.
- Yes, it is.

01:11:51.890 --> 01:11:55.560
If you could wake up and do the one thing
that would make you the happiest....

01:11:55.727 --> 01:11:57.270
- The happiest?
- Yeah, money aside.

01:11:57.437 --> 01:12:01.983
I would wake up on the beach somewhere
just making stuff every day.

01:12:02.151 --> 01:12:03.484
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:12:03.652 --> 01:12:06.279
Really? Tables and chairs,
that kind of thing?

01:12:06.446 --> 01:12:09.365
Anything. Everything.
But custom, one-of-a-kind stuff.

01:12:09.533 --> 01:12:13.202
Not the knock-off stuff you see
in people's kitchens from time to time.

01:12:13.370 --> 01:12:16.122
Hey. I don't have
a custom furniture-maker man.

01:12:16.290 --> 01:12:17.748
- Well, now you do.
- Okay? Heh.

01:12:17.916 --> 01:12:20.209
- So are you in business? Why aren't you?
- Heh.

01:12:20.377 --> 01:12:24.714
I will be as soon as the banks start making
the competitive rates and loans.

01:12:24.882 --> 01:12:26.591
Look, I've been saving for six years.

01:12:26.758 --> 01:12:29.677
Why do you think I'm doing
all these stupid businesses...

01:12:29.845 --> 01:12:34.974
...and the stripping? I've saved about 13
grand. It's gonna happen eventually.

01:12:35.142 --> 01:12:38.728
- Wow, 13. That's a lot of ones.
- Heh.

01:12:38.896 --> 01:12:40.605
There were some fives in there.

01:12:40.772 --> 01:12:42.106
No 20s?

01:12:42.274 --> 01:12:44.567
You don't want to know
what I have to do for 20s.

01:12:44.735 --> 01:12:46.903
- I don't.
- Let's drink these and I'll show you.

01:12:47.070 --> 01:12:49.155
- No, that's okay, heh.
- Heh.

01:12:49.323 --> 01:12:50.990
So, Miami, huh?

01:12:51.909 --> 01:12:52.950
Mm-hm.

01:12:54.328 --> 01:12:56.329
- Don't be mad.
- I'm not mad.

01:12:56.496 --> 01:13:00.333
I'm not trying to tell him what to do.
I just don't like it.

01:13:02.169 --> 01:13:07.506
Did you just...? I want to clear something up.
Did you just take my advice?

01:13:07.674 --> 01:13:11.302
By not telling him what to do?
No. I just don't have a choice.

01:13:11.470 --> 01:13:15.723
- I think that was something I said to you.
- What, you want some credit?

01:13:15.891 --> 01:13:17.308
- Are we fighting?
- Ha, ha.

01:13:17.476 --> 01:13:18.935
Is this our first fight?

01:13:19.186 --> 01:13:20.311
Come on. Let's make up.

01:13:20.479 --> 01:13:22.813
- I don't like being mad at you.
- Look at that face.

01:13:22.981 --> 01:13:25.191
- I really don't like being mad at you.
- You guys are going to have fun in Miami.

01:13:26.860 --> 01:13:29.028
Just try not to forget
about the normal people.

01:13:29.279 --> 01:13:32.323
Like the people who exist in the daylight.
The non-vampires.

01:13:32.491 --> 01:13:34.575
- So you're not a vampire?
- No, I'm not a vampire.

01:13:34.743 --> 01:13:37.119
Well, this is not going to work out
at all between you and I.

01:13:39.539 --> 01:13:42.833
- A thing for vampires, heh?
- Yeah. Got a bit of a thing.

01:13:43.001 --> 01:13:45.002
You want to get something to eat
sometime?

01:13:45.170 --> 01:13:47.880
I don't know, just like get some food?

01:13:48.882 --> 01:13:50.883
What do you mean, like a date?

01:13:52.386 --> 01:13:55.888
No. If you don't want to call it that, no.

01:13:56.056 --> 01:13:57.098
I don't know.

01:13:57.266 --> 01:13:59.850
Why? Because of what's-his-name
that moved to Orlando?

01:14:00.018 --> 01:14:01.060
Paul?

01:14:01.228 --> 01:14:05.481
- Yeah. Paul and I are figuring things out.
- Hmm.

01:14:05.649 --> 01:14:06.983
How's that going, heh?

01:14:07.234 --> 01:14:09.568
- Are you going to weigh in on that too?
- No.

01:14:09.736 --> 01:14:13.864
Plus, I don't exactly sport-fuck
my brother's stripper friends.

01:14:14.032 --> 01:14:16.117
I'm sorry, who said anything about that?

01:14:16.285 --> 01:14:18.911
I was just talking about talking
and being friends.

01:14:19.079 --> 01:14:21.914
If you want to talk,
my door is always open, Mike.

01:14:22.416 --> 01:14:24.667
Are you trying to hit on my sister?

01:14:25.252 --> 01:14:29.005
No. I'm sorry, and if I was,
what the hell are you going to do about it?

01:14:29.172 --> 01:14:30.172
Whoa, brother.

01:14:31.508 --> 01:14:32.925
- Not me. Her.
- Heh.

01:14:33.093 --> 01:14:36.220
Oh, my God. Come on, let's do one more.
One more, come on.

01:14:36.388 --> 01:14:39.098
Dude, I would love to, but we can't.
You get Dallas' text?

01:14:39.266 --> 01:14:41.183
We got a sorority in like a half hour.

01:14:41.601 --> 01:14:43.060
A sorority?

01:14:43.228 --> 01:14:46.022
Five hundred bones to rub our nuts...

01:14:46.189 --> 01:14:49.108
- ...on some girl's chest.
- Adam, I see what's happening here.

01:14:49.276 --> 01:14:53.279
I ate a Kappa just like this.
I ate a Kappa. I ate a Kappa.

01:14:53.447 --> 01:14:56.073
You guys are really.... Have a great time.

01:14:56.241 --> 01:14:58.075
Come on. We gotta stop fighting like this.

01:14:58.243 --> 01:15:00.870
- Heh.
- We gotta stop fighting.

01:15:01.121 --> 01:15:03.497
Just find your own way back.
I got the keys, right?

01:15:03.665 --> 01:15:05.708
You do not have the keys.
Oh, shit, you do.

01:15:05.876 --> 01:15:08.544
- I have the keys.
- She's got the keys. We got to go.

01:15:24.144 --> 01:15:26.479
- Good evening. You live here?
- Yeah.

01:15:26.646 --> 01:15:28.606
- Yeah? What's your name?
- Kim.

01:15:28.774 --> 01:15:31.025
Kim, can you move back for me, please?

01:15:31.193 --> 01:15:34.653
We keep getting complaints
of noise and underage drinking.

01:15:34.821 --> 01:15:37.907
Gentlemen? Everybody's 21 here?

01:15:38.658 --> 01:15:40.951
I might need to check some IDs,
unfortunately.

01:15:41.119 --> 01:15:43.162
Can you accompany me in here, please?

01:15:44.664 --> 01:15:46.999
Ladies, everybody's 21 here?

01:15:47.167 --> 01:15:48.501
- Yeah.
- Yes?

01:15:48.668 --> 01:15:51.170
She is definitely not 21,
I'm sorry. What's your birthday?

01:15:51.338 --> 01:15:53.172
Uh, May 20th, 19....

01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:56.384
That's what I thought. Put your hands
on the wall. Everybody sit.

01:15:56.551 --> 01:15:58.552
We're going to be here for a while.

01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:01.222
Can you please spread your legs for me,
ma'am?

01:16:01.390 --> 01:16:04.850
You don't have anything sharp on you
that I can stick myself with, do you?

01:16:05.018 --> 01:16:06.936
- No.
- Good.

01:16:07.187 --> 01:16:09.105
Because I do.

01:17:50.582 --> 01:17:52.291
Did you see it?

01:17:57.130 --> 01:17:58.589
Hey!

01:17:58.757 --> 01:18:01.050
Did you give some Ecstasy to my girl?

01:18:01.301 --> 01:18:02.343
No.

01:18:02.511 --> 01:18:04.803
I said, did you give some Ecstasy
to my chick?

01:18:04.971 --> 01:18:06.055
Hey, fuck off.

01:18:06.223 --> 01:18:08.641
Okay. Cool.

01:18:20.237 --> 01:18:21.320
Hey!

01:18:25.492 --> 01:18:28.827
Hey, back the fuck up. We got to go.
Let's go. Adam, let's go.

01:18:28.995 --> 01:18:30.829
All right, back the fuck up.

01:18:34.167 --> 01:18:36.168
Let's go. Let's go.

01:18:38.255 --> 01:18:40.881
Oh, what are you doing, man?
What the fuck are you doing...

01:18:41.049 --> 01:18:43.092
...giving pills to girls
that you don't know?

01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:45.427
- Shit, dude.
- You're lucky we got out of there.

01:18:45.595 --> 01:18:48.097
- My backpack. We have to go back.
- Fuck your backpack.

01:18:48.265 --> 01:18:50.683
No, you don't understand.
It has my fucking pills.

01:18:50.850 --> 01:18:53.018
Fuck your pills.
You're going to have to eat it.

01:18:53.186 --> 01:18:56.063
Tobias fronted me pills.
Sell them off for some extra cash.

01:18:56.231 --> 01:18:58.816
What the fuck are you doing taking...?
Front from Tobias?

01:18:58.984 --> 01:19:00.859
Why is he giving you pills? How many?

01:19:01.111 --> 01:19:04.113
Heh, I don't know, man.
Fucking like a hundred.

01:19:04.281 --> 01:19:06.448
"Like a hundred," or a hundred?
That's a grand.

01:19:06.616 --> 01:19:08.409
Have to pay every one of those back.

01:19:08.577 --> 01:19:10.494
Fuck, dude. Fuck that. Guess what?

01:19:10.662 --> 01:19:13.330
- What do you mean, "fuck that"?
- I got that equity, baby.

01:19:13.498 --> 01:19:16.542
Dallas gave me that cut in Miami, whoo!

01:19:17.210 --> 01:19:20.421
I don't even fucking care
about a fucking grand. Who cares?

01:19:20.589 --> 01:19:23.882
Fuck. Damn, that was crazy shit.

01:19:24.551 --> 01:19:26.010
Fuck.

01:19:44.946 --> 01:19:47.573
- You bailing on me?
- Nope, not at all.

01:19:50.869 --> 01:19:54.705
- Oh, my God. What are you doing here?
- Hey.

01:19:54.873 --> 01:19:57.833
I thought you were out of town,
like, forever.

01:19:58.001 --> 01:20:01.211
Yeah, I decided to stay in town.

01:20:01.379 --> 01:20:03.547
- Great. What's up, man? Mike.
- Ryan.

01:20:03.715 --> 01:20:05.424
- Nice to meet you, sir.
- Nice to meet you.

01:20:05.592 --> 01:20:10.763
Uh, Ryan, um, is my fiancé.

01:20:14.976 --> 01:20:16.060
What?

01:20:18.146 --> 01:20:20.272
Are you fucking with me right now?

01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:22.232
I'm gonna go hit the bathroom.

01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:24.777
No. You guys sound like
you got a lot to talk about.

01:20:24.944 --> 01:20:27.321
It's time for me to go stare
in the mirror anyway.

01:20:27.489 --> 01:20:29.490
- Nice meeting you. See you, babe.
- Yes, sir.

01:20:29.658 --> 01:20:31.075
Okay.

01:20:37.499 --> 01:20:38.791
Hmm....

01:20:38.958 --> 01:20:42.002
Okay. All right, I'm not exactly....

01:20:45.173 --> 01:20:46.840
Okay. All right.

01:20:48.843 --> 01:20:50.177
It was good to see you.

01:20:50.428 --> 01:20:53.347
Well, lookie here what the cat dragged in.

01:20:53.598 --> 01:20:54.682
Coño, what happened?

01:20:56.226 --> 01:20:57.726
Uh....

01:20:57.894 --> 01:21:01.230
It was nothing. It was fucked up. Sorry.

01:21:01.398 --> 01:21:04.483
"It was fucked up"? "Sorry"?

01:21:05.610 --> 01:21:07.194
Mm-hm.
- That's all you got to say?

01:21:07.362 --> 01:21:09.822
I don't know. You really
want to discuss it?

01:21:10.949 --> 01:21:13.033
I take it you didn't collect.

01:21:13.201 --> 01:21:15.577
Yeah, I'm sorry. I forgot to ask
for the money...

01:21:15.745 --> 01:21:18.205
...as they were throwing beer bottles
at our heads.

01:21:18.790 --> 01:21:20.999
It's the last thing
I need for my reputation...

01:21:21.167 --> 01:21:22.918
...before we make the big move, Mike.

01:21:23.086 --> 01:21:24.878
I'm sorry.
Are we fucking your reputation up?

01:21:25.046 --> 01:21:26.213
Hmm.

01:21:27.549 --> 01:21:31.343
The last time I checked,
I think it's the Kid and I's reputation...

01:21:31.511 --> 01:21:34.304
...that's "making the big move"
for you, isn't it?

01:21:38.143 --> 01:21:40.060
What the fuck did you say, buddy?

01:21:40.228 --> 01:21:43.605
I don't know, you were standing six feet
away from me. You heard me.

01:21:44.733 --> 01:21:47.901
Hey, you might want to check yourself,
old friend.

01:21:48.737 --> 01:21:51.321
Nobody walks on water on my team.

01:21:51.489 --> 01:21:53.157
Except for you, right?

01:21:53.908 --> 01:21:55.701
Old friend.

01:21:55.869 --> 01:21:57.870
Ah.

01:22:01.082 --> 01:22:02.916
What are you thinking about?

01:22:03.501 --> 01:22:06.628
Biting the hand that feeds you,
big dog, huh?

01:22:09.007 --> 01:22:11.341
You don't fucking feed me, Dallas.

01:22:12.260 --> 01:22:15.888
I can walk right out that door.
Right now.

01:22:16.055 --> 01:22:19.016
And do a fuck of a lot better
than 7.5 percent.

01:22:19.184 --> 01:22:21.393
I'm sorry, that used to be 10.

01:22:21.561 --> 01:22:23.103
But you don't.

01:22:24.606 --> 01:22:28.108
You didn't. And you won't.

01:22:28.276 --> 01:22:29.777
Because you can't.

01:22:29.944 --> 01:22:31.695
I can't? Okay.

01:22:32.447 --> 01:22:35.199
So you got to deal with what you got.

01:22:35.366 --> 01:22:36.950
Hey, what's going on?

01:22:38.119 --> 01:22:40.204
- That pack you gave me?
- Mm.

01:22:40.872 --> 01:22:43.165
- It's gone.
- That's great.

01:22:43.333 --> 01:22:44.541
Gone.

01:22:44.751 --> 01:22:46.627
It's "gone" gone.

01:22:46.795 --> 01:22:49.630
- You lost it?
- I'm sorry, man.

01:22:50.507 --> 01:22:52.633
Fuck sorry. You got to take care of this.

01:22:52.801 --> 01:22:54.384
We'll figure it out. It's fine.

01:22:54.552 --> 01:22:56.804
No, you need to figure it out.

01:22:56.971 --> 01:22:58.972
Get the fuck off me.

01:23:00.642 --> 01:23:03.560
Seniority don't mean shit around here, man.

01:23:03.728 --> 01:23:06.939
You are worth the cash you
pry out of their fucking purses.

01:23:07.106 --> 01:23:09.024
You know that better than anybody.

01:23:09.192 --> 01:23:12.361
You want a bigger piece?
Come up with some fresher shit, man.

01:23:12.529 --> 01:23:14.446
You're not getting any younger.

01:23:15.990 --> 01:23:18.242
What the fuck are you doing?

01:23:18.910 --> 01:23:22.913
I need you doing the sailor routine tonight.
I got four tables of Navy wives stageside.

01:23:23.081 --> 01:23:26.416
- Get changed.
- Oh, no. I'm taking your advice.

01:23:26.584 --> 01:23:30.921
Bringing you some fresher shit.
Seeing as I'm getting equity and all.

01:24:44.787 --> 01:24:46.872
Perfect date time.

01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.209
Give me the astronaut thing.

01:24:51.377 --> 01:24:53.420
I met this guy....

01:24:53.671 --> 01:24:55.756
You got them going out there, Mike.

01:24:56.257 --> 01:24:58.133
Good job, man.

01:24:59.427 --> 01:25:03.180
He's met just about every single
Russian and American astronaut...

01:25:03.431 --> 01:25:06.350
...that's ever been in outer space,
living or dead.

01:25:07.935 --> 01:25:10.437
The first man in outer space...

01:25:11.272 --> 01:25:13.065
...Russian. Yuri Gagarin.

01:25:13.232 --> 01:25:14.775
- Cosmonaut.
- He's the second one.

01:25:14.942 --> 01:25:17.069
The first one died on reentry.

01:25:17.236 --> 01:25:19.529
We're gonna get fucked up tonight, right?

01:27:07.555 --> 01:27:08.930
Mike.

01:27:12.101 --> 01:27:13.143
Mike, hello.

01:27:16.189 --> 01:27:17.522
Open up.

01:27:24.572 --> 01:27:27.073
- Mike.
- All right. Hold on.

01:27:33.206 --> 01:27:34.539
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:27:34.707 --> 01:27:36.166
You have fun last night?

01:27:36.334 --> 01:27:38.460
- What?
- Did you have fun last night?

01:27:38.628 --> 01:27:40.170
Yeah, uh, what's up?

01:27:40.338 --> 01:27:41.922
Is Adam here?

01:27:42.590 --> 01:27:46.343
He left me weird-sounding voice messages,
sounded fucked up.

01:27:46.511 --> 01:27:48.011
And now I can't reach him.

01:27:48.179 --> 01:27:50.430
- Yeah, he's in here.
- Okay. Cool.

01:27:54.936 --> 01:27:56.478
Where is he?

01:27:56.646 --> 01:27:58.480
Uh, he should be upstairs.

01:27:58.648 --> 01:28:03.777
He's with somebody, though,
so, you know, I'd call out.

01:28:03.945 --> 01:28:05.111
Kid.

01:28:07.907 --> 01:28:09.533
Adam?

01:28:09.742 --> 01:28:11.117
Adam. Adam.

01:28:11.285 --> 01:28:12.494
- Fuck.
- Adam.

01:28:12.662 --> 01:28:13.995
Hey. Come here.

01:28:15.331 --> 01:28:16.873
Stop. He's fine, he's breathing.

01:28:17.041 --> 01:28:19.501
Oh, my God, Adam.
What the fuck did he take?

01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:21.878
Uh, probably just some G.
Open your eyes, dude.

01:28:22.046 --> 01:28:24.798
- What the fuck did you do to my brother?
- Relax. Yo, Brooke.

01:28:24.966 --> 01:28:26.591
He's breathing. He's fine.

01:28:26.759 --> 01:28:30.679
Get the fuck off me, Mike. I'll fucking kill you.
I will fucking kill you.

01:28:30.847 --> 01:28:32.681
- He's going to be fine, heh.
- He's not okay.

01:28:32.849 --> 01:28:34.599
- Calm down.
- No, shut up. Shut up!

01:28:34.767 --> 01:28:37.310
Shut up. I see you, Mike.
I fucking see you.

01:28:37.478 --> 01:28:41.439
You think you have your shit all figured
out, but I fucking see you.

01:28:41.607 --> 01:28:44.693
You just need to relax.
You're acting fucking crazy. And I get it.

01:28:44.861 --> 01:28:47.821
You are a bullshit,
30-year-old male stripper.

01:28:48.990 --> 01:28:51.908
- Okay. How about just get the fuck out?
- No problem.

01:28:52.076 --> 01:28:55.662
Done. Adam, wake the fuck up.
Adam, please.

01:28:55.830 --> 01:28:58.874
Adam, let's go. Come on, Adam.

01:28:59.083 --> 01:29:00.876
Adam. God.

01:29:01.043 --> 01:29:03.253
Adam. Wake up. Adam, we have to go.

01:29:03.421 --> 01:29:05.130
- Stop.
- No, Mike, this is my brother.

01:29:05.298 --> 01:29:08.592
Brooke, let me please carry him out.
Stop.

01:29:32.867 --> 01:29:35.035
I can't do this anymore, Adam.

01:29:40.124 --> 01:29:41.458
You hear me?

01:30:30.925 --> 01:30:32.425
Come on, let's go.

01:30:33.094 --> 01:30:35.095
You guys need to stop already.

01:30:38.099 --> 01:30:39.432
Motherfucker.

01:30:42.645 --> 01:30:44.562
Mike? Get off of him. Hey.

01:30:44.772 --> 01:30:45.814
Hey!

01:30:49.110 --> 01:30:50.568
- Fuck off.
- I'm so sorry, primo.

01:30:50.736 --> 01:30:51.778
Sorry? Fuck you, man.

01:30:51.946 --> 01:30:53.863
What are you doing breaking
into my house?

01:30:54.031 --> 01:30:55.740
I tried calling your cell, man.

01:30:55.908 --> 01:30:58.535
My cell? Fuck my cell.
What are you fucking doing, man?

01:30:58.703 --> 01:31:01.663
I told them not to break shit,
but they don't work for me.

01:31:01.831 --> 01:31:03.665
That did a good job, didn't it?

01:31:03.833 --> 01:31:07.293
Look, man, I'm sorry.
We're looking for the Kid, okay?

01:31:07.461 --> 01:31:08.753
Uh, so you brought them here?

01:31:08.921 --> 01:31:11.881
- What are you looking for him for?
- He's late on his front.

01:31:12.049 --> 01:31:13.967
And as you can see, he was due today.

01:31:14.218 --> 01:31:18.054
It's 100 pills. That's 1000 bucks.
I think he's good for that, don't you?

01:31:18.222 --> 01:31:21.474
No, no, no.
Is that what he told you? A hundred?

01:31:21.642 --> 01:31:24.728
We went in on a whole pack, hombre.
A whole pack.

01:31:26.856 --> 01:31:29.315
- What's his half?
- Ten grand.

01:31:30.901 --> 01:31:33.319
- What?
- Ten grand.

01:31:33.779 --> 01:31:37.615
I don't know if he lost it,
or if he's just being a fucking kid.

01:31:37.783 --> 01:31:40.535
Either way, it doesn't matter anymore.
Okay?

01:31:41.078 --> 01:31:42.746
Look, you got to...

01:31:44.498 --> 01:31:45.832
What am I...?

01:31:46.751 --> 01:31:49.335
I don't know, I can maybe sign over
the van...

01:31:49.503 --> 01:31:51.671
...until he can figure out
something out.

01:31:52.339 --> 01:31:53.673
Fuck, I don't know, man.

01:31:53.924 --> 01:31:59.262
Come on, primo. The guys I'm rolling with,
they ain't about fucking paperwork, man.

01:32:03.642 --> 01:32:07.062
If you want, I can talk to my guys
and we can try to get him another day.

01:32:07.229 --> 01:32:09.731
And what the fuck would that do?
He doesn't have it.

01:32:09.899 --> 01:32:12.776
Hey, look...
I just hate to see you doing this.

01:32:13.194 --> 01:32:15.153
Just don't give him any more shit to sell.

01:32:15.321 --> 01:32:17.906
No, that's fine.
He's starting to act like a real punk.

01:32:18.074 --> 01:32:21.326
- One of us should talk to him.
- Well, you've done enough, haven't you?

01:32:21.494 --> 01:32:22.786
I'll talk to him. It's fine.

01:32:53.734 --> 01:32:55.026
Hey.

01:32:56.153 --> 01:32:57.403
Um....

01:32:57.571 --> 01:32:59.364
I'm looking for Adam.
He's not picking up his phone.

01:32:59.532 --> 01:33:02.158
- Is he all right?
- Yeah, he's okay.

01:33:02.326 --> 01:33:04.911
I mean, he doesn't live here anymore.

01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:07.163
Where is he?

01:33:07.832 --> 01:33:10.291
I'm not sure. I think he's with Nora.

01:33:14.922 --> 01:33:19.134
Okay, cool. Just, uh, let him know
that I'm looking for him if you see him.

01:33:20.761 --> 01:33:23.721
Ha, this is so much bullshit.

01:33:23.889 --> 01:33:25.098
You know that, right?

01:33:25.266 --> 01:33:28.852
This is really how we're going to end this?
Are you fucking serious?

01:33:31.021 --> 01:33:34.816
- I said everything I needed to say.
- You had a lot to say yesterday.

01:33:34.984 --> 01:33:37.902
You don't have anything else to say?
You want to add onto that?

01:33:38.070 --> 01:33:40.488
You damn sure didn't let me talk,
so let me talk now.

01:33:40.656 --> 01:33:42.282
I'm sorry that I fucked it up.

01:33:42.449 --> 01:33:45.702
I didn't mean to do that.
I didn't want to fuck it up. I promised...

01:33:45.870 --> 01:33:49.289
...that I would take care of him,
and I didn't, and I'm sorry about that.

01:33:49.456 --> 01:33:51.249
You're the last person that I...

01:33:53.794 --> 01:33:56.004
Yeah, I believe you...

01:33:56.172 --> 01:33:58.631
...and I know you're basically
a good person.

01:33:58.799 --> 01:34:00.842
Adam was...

01:34:03.095 --> 01:34:05.597
...going to do whatever Adam wanted to do.

01:34:07.558 --> 01:34:09.350
I just can't be around your lifestyle.

01:34:09.518 --> 01:34:13.146
You can't be around my...?
I'm not my lifestyle.

01:34:15.399 --> 01:34:18.484
That's who you think...?
That isn't fucking...

01:34:20.154 --> 01:34:22.447
I'm not... Am I Magic, uh...?

01:34:22.615 --> 01:34:24.657
Am I Magic Mike right now talking to you?

01:34:27.161 --> 01:34:30.371
I'm not my goddamn job.
That's not who...

01:34:30.539 --> 01:34:34.542
That's not what I do. That's not me.
It is what I do, but it's not who I am.

01:34:34.710 --> 01:34:36.461
I'm not just...

01:34:37.838 --> 01:34:39.380
That's why I want to go to Miami.

01:34:39.548 --> 01:34:42.050
I don't want to fucking be
some 40-year-old stripper.

01:34:42.218 --> 01:34:44.344
I want to own something.
I want to actually...

01:34:49.683 --> 01:34:52.018
I've been trying to, this whole time...

01:34:57.024 --> 01:34:59.484
So you don't believe anything
that I've said to you?

01:34:59.652 --> 01:35:01.861
You don't... Right now.
Nothing. I'm just...

01:35:02.112 --> 01:35:03.446
You don't believe any of it?

01:35:04.448 --> 01:35:07.242
Mike, I think the question is,
do you believe it?

01:35:10.037 --> 01:35:14.332
I just think that Miami is going to be
a bigger, badder version of this.

01:35:14.500 --> 01:35:16.542
But good luck to you.

01:35:18.045 --> 01:35:20.046
If you believe it, good luck to you.

01:35:20.631 --> 01:35:22.215
And Adam too.

01:35:22.633 --> 01:35:24.592
But I'm going to be here.

01:35:44.238 --> 01:35:45.488
Hey.

01:35:46.699 --> 01:35:47.824
I, uh....

01:35:48.492 --> 01:35:51.411
I want to say thank you about the money.

01:35:51.578 --> 01:35:53.496
I know how much that shit meant to you...

01:35:53.664 --> 01:35:57.375
...especially because of that
furniture crap you wanted to do.

01:36:00.254 --> 01:36:01.587
I, uh....

01:36:03.590 --> 01:36:07.427
I'm gonna pay you back every last cent.
I want you to know that.

01:36:10.222 --> 01:36:11.264
All right.

01:36:11.432 --> 01:36:15.435
Man, we're gonna look back in 20 years.
You're gonna be dead, probably...

01:36:15.602 --> 01:36:20.523
...but I can look back in 20 years and look
at the shit that we've done together, man.

01:36:20.691 --> 01:36:24.569
Fuck. Look where I was three months ago.

01:36:25.362 --> 01:36:26.863
Three months ago.

01:36:27.114 --> 01:36:29.073
Look at where I am now.

01:36:30.993 --> 01:36:32.869
I can't thank you enough.

01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:35.705
Fuck, man. I was nowhere.

01:36:36.790 --> 01:36:38.666
I have money.

01:36:38.834 --> 01:36:41.127
I can fuck who I want to fuck.

01:36:41.462 --> 01:36:44.380
I have freedom, thanks to you.

01:36:45.632 --> 01:36:48.301
And I'm having a fucking ball.

01:36:49.970 --> 01:36:53.973
And we're going to have a fucking ball
in Miami, man.

01:36:54.141 --> 01:36:57.060
So can you smile? Can you look at me?

01:36:59.313 --> 01:37:01.105
I only have one thing to say.

01:37:01.273 --> 01:37:03.816
And that is:
To my best friend.

01:37:06.487 --> 01:37:11.574
A guy who has given me more in this
lifetime than I could ever ask for.

01:37:13.827 --> 01:37:15.828
And to bright futures.

01:37:18.123 --> 01:37:20.166
Ladies of Tampa

01:37:24.296 --> 01:37:29.133
The first time that you
ever walked into my life

01:37:30.803 --> 01:37:35.932
In oh many ways you all became my wife

01:37:37.393 --> 01:37:39.727
Ladies, yeah, I'm talkin' to you

01:37:42.272 --> 01:37:45.691
Ladies of Tampa

01:37:47.653 --> 01:37:51.280
Even though we gotta go

01:37:51.615 --> 01:37:54.617
There's one thing you gotta know

01:37:55.577 --> 01:38:01.040
Ain't no matter
How much you love me for sure

01:38:01.208 --> 01:38:04.127
Ooh, ooh, ooh

01:38:04.336 --> 01:38:06.129
I'll always love you more

01:38:08.757 --> 01:38:11.843
I'll always love you more than you know

01:38:12.010 --> 01:38:16.055
You got me tied to a chain
I'm just a slave to your soul

01:38:16.223 --> 01:38:21.519
And there ain't nothin' I can do about it
That's fo' sho

01:38:25.315 --> 01:38:27.650
Ladies of Tampa

01:39:09.234 --> 01:39:11.068
- I could be a friend to you.
- Ha, ha.

01:39:11.320 --> 01:39:12.737
What about romance?

01:39:12.988 --> 01:39:15.823
Hit them with the long arm of love, baby.

01:39:16.158 --> 01:39:18.951
- My good friend, Andy.
- Ha, ha.

01:39:19.119 --> 01:39:21.078
I'm just saying you always put up a fight.

01:39:21.246 --> 01:39:24.832
Anaconda Part 3.

01:39:25.209 --> 01:39:26.667
Hey, uh, what about...?

01:41:02.264 --> 01:41:03.431
Whoo!

01:41:03.599 --> 01:41:04.640
- Yeah.
- Motherfucker.

01:41:04.808 --> 01:41:06.976
Dallas be riding again.

01:41:07.144 --> 01:41:09.437
Whoo! It's a fucking revival.

01:41:09.771 --> 01:41:11.397
Huh!

01:41:11.565 --> 01:41:14.525
Hot damn. It feels good to be back
on that fucking horse again.

01:41:14.693 --> 01:41:18.070
- That was the old stuff.
- Oh, shit.

01:41:18.238 --> 01:41:19.614
Still got it.

01:41:19.781 --> 01:41:21.991
Y'all ready to rock a little
and fucking rein them in?

01:41:22.159 --> 01:41:23.951
Yeah.

01:41:24.119 --> 01:41:25.161
Yeah.

01:41:25.329 --> 01:41:26.412
Where's Mike?

01:41:26.580 --> 01:41:27.997
He's gone.

01:41:28.165 --> 01:41:29.206
Mikey?

01:41:29.374 --> 01:41:32.084
He went back to take a piss.
He should be back any second.

01:41:32.252 --> 01:41:33.544
Mikey's gone.

01:41:33.712 --> 01:41:35.421
What do you mean, he's gone?

01:41:36.173 --> 01:41:39.675
I thought he was going to go take a piss
and he went out the back door.

01:41:41.261 --> 01:41:42.928
Hey, Mike, yo.

01:41:43.930 --> 01:41:45.097
Let's go, we're up.

01:41:48.852 --> 01:41:50.853
He's coming back, man.

01:41:53.273 --> 01:41:55.733
All right, come here.

01:41:59.738 --> 01:42:01.572
You ready to be the man?

01:42:02.449 --> 01:42:05.534
- Are you ready to be the man?
- Yes, I'm ready.

01:42:06.620 --> 01:42:08.746
- I've been waiting for this for a long time.
- It's all yours. Come here.

01:42:10.123 --> 01:42:12.625
Start right fucking now.
Let's make it fucking count.

01:42:12.793 --> 01:42:15.628
All the way. Let's go.
Kid's in, Mike's out.

01:42:15.796 --> 01:42:20.466
Let's bring this motherfucker down
all the way to Miami. Let's go. Hey.

01:42:20.634 --> 01:42:24.095
All right, ladies. So we know we made fire.

01:42:24.262 --> 01:42:26.889
We know we got fire,
now we got to make it rain.

01:42:27.057 --> 01:42:30.685
Can you make it rain, ladies?
Can you make it rain?

01:42:30.852 --> 01:42:33.896
Let's give it up for the last time
on this stage.

01:42:34.064 --> 01:42:39.652
The one, the only, your very own,
the Cock-rocking Kings of Tampa.

01:42:54.876 --> 01:42:55.960
Hey.

01:42:56.461 --> 01:42:58.379
What are you doing here?

01:43:00.424 --> 01:43:01.716
Um....

01:43:02.884 --> 01:43:04.885
Aren't you supposed to be at the show?

01:43:09.141 --> 01:43:11.142
Can I, uh, um...?

01:43:12.144 --> 01:43:14.395
I just need to talk.

01:43:20.152 --> 01:43:21.485
Yeah, okay.

01:43:22.154 --> 01:43:23.487
Come on in.

01:43:45.635 --> 01:43:47.595
Um....

01:43:49.890 --> 01:43:51.515
I, uh... I just came by to...

01:43:51.683 --> 01:43:53.768
Look, before you say anything...

01:43:53.935 --> 01:43:55.603
...I just need you to know that...

01:43:55.771 --> 01:44:00.149
...when you came by this morning,
Adam hadn't told me what you did for him.

01:44:00.317 --> 01:44:02.735
And that was really a lot of money.

01:44:02.903 --> 01:44:06.322
- You did not have to do that.
- I didn't do it for him.

01:44:07.532 --> 01:44:10.576
Look, that's not even why I came by.
I just...

01:44:11.828 --> 01:44:15.456
Ah, um, look, I'm not going to Miami.

01:44:16.917 --> 01:44:21.295
- Really?
- Yeah. I think you're right. I'm done.

01:44:23.590 --> 01:44:25.216
Wow.

01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:28.177
What are you gonna do?

01:44:31.223 --> 01:44:34.683
Heh, I don't know. I
guess I need a new plan.

01:44:40.273 --> 01:44:43.359
Do you want to get some food
and talk about it?

01:44:48.698 --> 01:44:50.950
What, like a date?

01:44:52.828 --> 01:44:54.537
Well....

01:44:55.372 --> 01:44:57.790
What would Tall Paul say, huh?

01:44:58.458 --> 01:45:03.838
Tall Paul can't say anything anymore.
I broke up with him.

01:45:06.132 --> 01:45:07.800
He didn't like breakfast food?

01:45:10.136 --> 01:45:11.720
Not as much as I do.

01:45:11.888 --> 01:45:17.476
This is a good thing. In that case,
I would love to get some breakfast.

01:45:17.644 --> 01:45:18.853
Okay.

01:45:19.729 --> 01:45:21.272
Let's go get something to eat.

01:45:21.439 --> 01:45:26.360
The thing is I only go to one place.
It's my favorite place.

01:45:26.528 --> 01:45:29.488
They have the best omelets.
They know my order. I walk in...

01:45:29.656 --> 01:45:32.491
...the food's basically on the table.
They'd help you out too.

01:45:32.659 --> 01:45:35.536
Get some waffles for you, pancakes,
whatever you want.

01:45:35.704 --> 01:45:38.330
I love waffles. Let's go there.

01:45:39.082 --> 01:45:41.876
The problem is it doesn't open until 6 a.m.

01:45:48.508 --> 01:45:50.509
That's like seven hours from now.

01:45:52.429 --> 01:45:53.762
Mm-hm.

01:45:54.848 --> 01:45:56.140
Yeah.

01:45:59.185 --> 01:46:01.270
What could we do with seven hours?

01:46:02.305 --> 01:46:08.943
