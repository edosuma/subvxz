01:00.327 --> 01:02.995
- What?
- How can you wear that suit?

01:04.197 --> 01:06.732
Will you jump in the ocean
with me after dinner?

01:06.733 --> 01:10.036
No. You go right ahead. The guy at the
desk said there could be riptides.

01:10.037 --> 01:12.248
Come on. I'll protect you.

01:13.040 --> 01:14.640
Are you high?

01:15.642 --> 01:18.411
- A wee bit.
- Garrett, seriously?

01:18.412 --> 01:22.682
You brought pot to Mexico across
the border? You're insane.

01:22.683 --> 01:25.058
I've got something for you.

01:26.954 --> 01:29.124
Oh.

01:30.190 --> 01:32.167
30 years.

01:32.626 --> 01:34.830
Oh.

01:38.565 --> 01:40.766
- Viva Mexico!
<i>- SÃ­. Viva Mexico.</i>

01:40.767 --> 01:42.702
Still here for us after
all these years.

01:42.703 --> 01:43.736
Cheers.

01:43.737 --> 01:46.205
- Oh, honey. Sit down.
<i>- Vamanos, mujer.</i>

01:47.207 --> 01:48.708
Let's dance.

01:48.709 --> 01:50.309
Come on.

01:50.310 --> 01:54.480
The band's playing, there's guacamole
in the air, tequila on my tongue.

01:54.481 --> 01:55.481
Come on.

02:50.237 --> 02:52.004
Garrett?

02:52.005 --> 02:53.639
Garrett.

04:29.970 --> 04:32.072
Garrett?

04:55.862 --> 04:58.297
Can you believe we're finally here?

04:58.298 --> 04:59.698
It's beautiful.

04:59.699 --> 05:01.400
You built a beautiful house.

05:01.401 --> 05:02.635
I built it for you.

05:37.504 --> 05:40.172
<i>Thanks so much for
listening. This is KCRW</i>

05:40.173 --> 05:42.308
<i>it's gonna be a hot one
in downtown Los Angeles.</i>

05:42.309 --> 05:44.944
<i>Might be a good day to slip out
to the beach and cool off.</i>

05:44.945 --> 05:46.011
<i>That's what I want to do.</i>

05:46.012 --> 05:49.048
<i>For the weekend, the National Weather
Service is issuing a high...</i>

05:59.392 --> 06:01.427
- Morning.
- Morning.

06:01.428 --> 06:04.736
Mom, why is Roger always
swimming in your pool?

06:05.398 --> 06:07.199
Because he's a
neighbor and a friend,

06:07.200 --> 06:09.401
and why shouldn't he?

06:09.402 --> 06:10.736
Maybe he should pay the pool boy.

06:10.737 --> 06:12.571
He's the only one that uses it.

06:12.572 --> 06:15.709
Well, somebody should enjoy it.

06:15.809 --> 06:17.309
I heard you on the phone all night.

06:17.310 --> 06:18.777
Was that Josh?

06:18.778 --> 06:19.778
Mm-hmm.

06:19.779 --> 06:20.880
Oh.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.781
I'm going home today.

06:22.782 --> 06:23.883
What?

06:23.884 --> 06:25.050
Back to Seattle?

06:25.051 --> 06:26.585
What about our weekend?

06:26.586 --> 06:27.887
Oh, honey.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.154
You're obsessed.

06:29.155 --> 06:31.735
I don't want you to
lose yourself in this.

06:32.092 --> 06:34.760
Honey, you put so much
into these relationships.

06:34.761 --> 06:37.500
I just don't want to see
you get hurt is all.

06:38.031 --> 06:40.577
Well, do you think
that's avoidable?

06:41.768 --> 06:44.541
No, no, it isn't.

06:50.076 --> 06:51.848
Hey.

07:05.859 --> 07:08.871
Do you ever go there
anymore... the museum?

07:09.829 --> 07:11.196
Oh.

07:11.197 --> 07:13.970
No, not since your father.

07:14.234 --> 07:16.035
You used to practically live there.

07:16.036 --> 07:17.036
Mm.

07:17.037 --> 07:20.243
Well, I don't like to look back.

07:30.717 --> 07:32.084
<i>To the south,</i>

07:32.085 --> 07:34.086
<i>and there's a new exhibition
opening this week</i>

07:34.087 --> 07:36.722
<i>at the Los Angeles
County Museum of Art,</i>

07:36.723 --> 07:39.058
<i>going back in time over
the last two millennia</i>

07:39.059 --> 07:41.827
<i>and exploring the roots of
sculptural representation...</i>

07:56.609 --> 07:57.743
Mm.

08:02.682 --> 08:04.488
Hello.

08:05.852 --> 08:08.363
Uh, no, he's not.

08:09.856 --> 08:12.124
I'm... let me interrupt you.

08:12.125 --> 08:13.826
Excuse me.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.561
He... he's dead.

08:15.562 --> 08:18.764
He died five years ago.

08:18.765 --> 08:20.099
That... that's all right.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.700
Yes, you can take
him off your list.

08:21.701 --> 08:22.701
Thanks.

08:46.026 --> 08:48.727
Oh, God, there's nothing like
the smell of fresh bread,

08:48.728 --> 08:49.728
is there?

08:49.729 --> 08:52.464
I'm so glad I hired you.

08:52.465 --> 08:55.667
Nikki, you have really put
some life into this place.

08:55.668 --> 08:57.102
Thanks. It's what I do.

08:57.103 --> 08:58.837
It's been on the market 18 months.

08:58.838 --> 09:00.672
I had to drop the
price three times.

09:00.673 --> 09:02.574
Well, you know what?
I'm not surprised.

09:02.575 --> 09:05.044
It was like a mausoleum
when I got in here.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.645
I kept expecting to see

09:06.646 --> 09:08.847
Norma Desmond grieving
over her dead chimp.

09:09.983 --> 09:12.084
Looks good.

09:12.085 --> 09:14.086
Flowers.

09:14.087 --> 09:15.587
Nice.

09:15.588 --> 09:17.623
Uh, that goes up in
the master, please.

09:17.624 --> 09:19.294
Yes, ma'am.

09:19.859 --> 09:22.336
Oh, good.

09:31.371 --> 09:32.671
It's four bedrooms.

09:32.672 --> 09:35.718
There's a really huge...

09:42.248 --> 09:44.416
Elementary schools.

09:44.417 --> 09:47.419
Talk to them. And, um...

09:47.420 --> 09:49.465
And you've seen the list of...

10:01.000 --> 10:03.170
Hmm.

10:29.762 --> 10:31.930
In Pursuit of the Past?

10:31.931 --> 10:33.669
What?

10:34.934 --> 10:38.003
Special exhibition or
regular collection?

10:38.004 --> 10:40.515
Uh, just regular
collection, please.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.041
Are you a member?

10:43.042 --> 10:45.713
Uh, no, not anymore.

11:04.197 --> 11:05.197
Oh.

11:06.466 --> 11:09.137
I love going here with you.

13:13.293 --> 13:14.459
Here we are.

13:14.460 --> 13:16.261
Went to the cemetery today.

13:16.262 --> 13:18.330
- Oh.
- Have you been lately?

13:18.331 --> 13:21.767
I mean, wait till you see it. You know
that... that lawn... that big open field

13:21.768 --> 13:24.236
that used to be there? You
know they've swallowed it up.

13:24.237 --> 13:28.373
It's just all headstones and benches
and mausoleums... the whole shebang.

13:28.374 --> 13:31.143
I mean, they have more dead than
they know what to do with them.

13:31.144 --> 13:33.879
No, I don't go too often anymore.

13:33.880 --> 13:34.913
I get it.

13:34.914 --> 13:36.615
You grieved enough.

13:36.616 --> 13:38.950
- Well...
- I was always in awe of you.

13:38.951 --> 13:41.320
You did it the right way.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.321
I don't think so.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.022
Mm. I made an ass of myself.

13:44.023 --> 13:46.625
- You did not.
- I always did the wrong things.

13:46.626 --> 13:49.328
There's no wrong way.

13:49.329 --> 13:52.230
- You want to hear something funny?
- Yes, please.

13:52.231 --> 13:54.132
I thought I saw him today.

13:54.133 --> 13:56.868
- Who?
- Garrett.

13:56.869 --> 13:58.203
What do you mean? That's...

13:58.204 --> 14:01.873
At the museum. Looked
like him, anyway.

14:01.874 --> 14:04.609
He walked right by me...
was a double.

14:04.610 --> 14:06.945
It was... God, it was
almost a perfect double.

14:06.946 --> 14:09.881
Oh, Christ, that must
have been, like...

14:09.882 --> 14:12.086
- Oh, it was.
- Wow.

14:14.187 --> 14:15.687
What do you think he
was, like, a projection,

14:15.688 --> 14:17.656
or maybe you're just... you know,
wishful thinking, you know?

14:17.657 --> 14:19.958
- No, I didn't make him up.
- No, no, I didn't mean that.

14:19.959 --> 14:22.094
I mean, it's just that, you know,
you... you saw someone

14:22.095 --> 14:24.763
- who looked similar, and you... you...
- No. No.

14:24.764 --> 14:27.699
It was... it was incredible.

14:27.700 --> 14:30.202
Well, you know what they say. We all
have a double somewhere in the world.

14:30.203 --> 14:31.670
That's right.

14:31.671 --> 14:33.105
Wow.

14:33.106 --> 14:35.040
I have to look through
shoe boxes of old photos

14:35.041 --> 14:36.708
just to remember what
Susan looked like.

14:36.709 --> 14:37.943
Oh, you do not.

14:37.944 --> 14:39.444
Well, she's a bit chalky.

14:39.445 --> 14:41.446
Oh, that's so sad.

14:42.615 --> 14:45.217
So maybe this guy's your type.

14:45.218 --> 14:46.952
Or do you have a type?

14:46.953 --> 14:47.986
No.

14:47.987 --> 14:49.688
I mean yes: Garrett.

14:49.689 --> 14:51.990
Hmm.

14:51.991 --> 14:53.892
What are you gonna do?

14:53.893 --> 14:55.193
- Do?
- Yeah.

14:55.194 --> 14:56.962
What do you mean?
I'm not gonna do anything.

14:56.963 --> 14:59.564
Really?

14:59.565 --> 15:00.966
Are you gonna try
and see him again?

15:00.967 --> 15:02.033
You know...

15:02.034 --> 15:04.436
To say what? "Excuse me, sir.

15:04.437 --> 15:06.571
"You happen to be a double
for my dead husband.

15:06.572 --> 15:07.639
Can I buy you a drink?"

15:09.208 --> 15:10.475
Yeah, yeah. That's right.

15:10.476 --> 15:11.710
It's a little creepy, yeah.

15:11.711 --> 15:12.844
No.

15:12.845 --> 15:14.346
I have to say it was nice.

15:14.347 --> 15:16.181
It was just nice for a moment,

15:16.182 --> 15:17.349
seeing him today,

15:17.350 --> 15:19.851
believing Garrett was still around.

15:19.852 --> 15:22.955
It just felt like it used to.

15:23.356 --> 15:25.867
Felt like being alive again.

17:37.290 --> 17:39.324
Good morning, Nikki.

17:39.325 --> 17:42.227
Morning, Antonio.

17:42.228 --> 17:45.206
Oop.

18:59.305 --> 19:00.672
Hello!

19:00.673 --> 19:02.741
Uh, excuse me!

19:02.742 --> 19:04.480
Excuse me!

20:06.539 --> 20:08.273
Oh, wah-ha...

20:55.588 --> 20:57.288
Um, excuse me.

20:57.289 --> 20:59.994
Do you know where room 200 is?

21:27.319 --> 21:29.788
Uh, excuse me.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.589
May I help you?

21:31.590 --> 21:33.091
Hi.

21:33.092 --> 21:34.392
Hello.

21:34.393 --> 21:35.860
Hi.

21:35.861 --> 21:37.729
Wh-what can I do for you?

21:37.730 --> 21:40.431
I, uh, was interested in the class.

21:40.432 --> 21:44.102
Oh, I'm sorry, but we're in
the middle of a semester.

21:44.103 --> 21:45.403
Oh.

21:45.404 --> 21:46.771
Did you check with the office?

21:46.772 --> 21:47.972
Did you check with Admissions?

21:47.973 --> 21:50.108
You know, I... I didn't.
Well, I did.

21:50.109 --> 21:54.012
Um, I just, um... just
to find the classroom.

21:54.013 --> 21:55.947
I-I... it was just

21:55.948 --> 21:57.482
a spur-of-the-moment kind of thing.

21:57.483 --> 21:59.117
Well, this is a college.

21:59.118 --> 22:01.019
They're not very spontaneous.

22:01.020 --> 22:03.454
Right.

22:03.455 --> 22:04.789
Yeah.

22:06.458 --> 22:07.458
Are you all right?

22:07.459 --> 22:11.129
I'm so sorry. I just didn't...
I didn't think this through.

22:11.130 --> 22:13.531
Well, no worries. I mean, the next
semester starts in January or...

22:13.532 --> 22:16.267
- a couple months.
- No, I-I... no...

22:16.268 --> 22:17.435
What?

22:17.436 --> 22:18.703
You sure... are you okay?

22:18.704 --> 22:21.272
No, it's just a...

22:21.273 --> 22:22.707
an empty-nest kind of a thing.

22:22.708 --> 22:25.109
I-I just wanted to keep busy.

22:25.110 --> 22:27.178
Well, kids, huh?

22:27.179 --> 22:31.549
They're just one long grieving process.
You know, where's my baby?

22:31.550 --> 22:33.585
Where's my kindergartner?
Where's my little boy?

22:33.586 --> 22:35.153
Exactly. Well, you know...

22:35.154 --> 22:36.654
It's okay. It's okay.

22:36.655 --> 22:38.523
- I... this is...
- It's okay.

22:38.524 --> 22:39.924
- It's okay.
- I shouldn't have come.

22:39.925 --> 22:40.925
No, it's all right.

22:40.926 --> 22:43.761
No, no. I... this...
this isn't real.

22:43.762 --> 22:45.196
- What?
- It's just not real.

22:45.197 --> 22:46.631
You're not...

22:46.632 --> 22:48.302
Wait.

23:14.693 --> 23:17.295
Hmm.

23:23.068 --> 23:25.705
Mm.

23:36.815 --> 23:38.516
Yeah, right.

23:38.517 --> 23:39.717
I understand.

23:39.718 --> 23:44.130
Well, I'll see you Monday.

23:46.926 --> 23:47.959
You're back.

23:47.960 --> 23:49.698
Yeah.

23:50.896 --> 23:53.231
Are you gonna run away on me again?

23:53.232 --> 23:54.699
I might.

23:54.700 --> 23:55.733
Understandable.

23:55.734 --> 23:58.703
I mean, look at me.
I'm one scary dude.

23:58.704 --> 23:59.938
Listen, I'm sorry.

23:59.939 --> 24:02.540
I think I was a little
strange the other day.

24:02.541 --> 24:04.175
Yeah, you were a little emotional.

24:04.176 --> 24:05.176
I was.

24:05.177 --> 24:07.545
Well, it's a strange time.

24:07.546 --> 24:10.181
Kids leaving home...
it's got to be strange.

24:10.182 --> 24:11.582
Mm.

24:11.583 --> 24:12.583
Yeah.

24:12.584 --> 24:14.686
Are you married?

24:14.687 --> 24:17.288
Um... no.

24:17.289 --> 24:18.289
Gone.

24:18.290 --> 24:19.290
Gone?

24:19.291 --> 24:20.491
Yeah. He left me.

24:20.492 --> 24:21.659
Just up and left?

24:23.262 --> 24:24.262
Brutal.

24:24.263 --> 24:26.069
- Yeah.
- Sorry.

24:27.099 --> 24:28.132
You go on, I guess.

24:28.133 --> 24:30.041
I guess.

24:34.306 --> 24:35.907
My wife left me.

24:35.908 --> 24:36.908
Oh.

24:36.909 --> 24:38.076
Ten years ago.

24:38.077 --> 24:39.644
Found somebody else,

24:39.645 --> 24:42.146
tells me he's the love of her life.

24:42.147 --> 24:43.848
Ouch.

24:43.849 --> 24:44.849
Right?

24:44.850 --> 24:47.518
I mean, it's been a decade,
and I still feel it.

24:47.519 --> 24:49.087
Well...

24:49.088 --> 24:53.324
Listen, I... um, do you do
anything outside of school...

24:53.325 --> 24:56.394
you know, like, uh,
private students?

24:56.395 --> 24:58.096
What are we talking, lessons?

24:58.097 --> 24:59.597
Yes.

24:59.598 --> 25:01.532
Exactly. Lessons.

25:01.533 --> 25:04.545
Well, uh, I-I don't usually.

25:05.037 --> 25:07.271
Oh.

25:07.272 --> 25:08.873
Um, well, listen,

25:08.874 --> 25:11.309
I-I have taken classes before.

25:11.310 --> 25:14.413
This is... I'm not a
complete amateur.

25:15.347 --> 25:17.749
My studio's not really
set up for that.

25:17.750 --> 25:19.617
Oh.

25:19.618 --> 25:22.887
Well, wait. You could
come to my house.

25:22.888 --> 25:24.322
Right?

25:24.323 --> 25:25.790
Okay?

25:25.791 --> 25:28.760
Uh, I could, uh,
give you my number,

25:28.761 --> 25:31.195
uh, and I'll write it
down for you here, right?

25:31.196 --> 25:34.565
And then you could, you
know, think about it.

25:34.566 --> 25:36.367
Um... I'll write my name down,

25:36.368 --> 25:38.302
and you could, you know,

25:38.303 --> 25:41.739
think about how much
you would charge,

25:41.740 --> 25:43.574
the whole bit, all right?

25:43.575 --> 25:45.610
So anyway, thanks.

25:45.611 --> 25:47.747
Thanks.

26:56.915 --> 26:57.915
Hi.

26:57.916 --> 26:59.790
Hi.

27:04.289 --> 27:06.891
Wow. I can't believe you're here.

27:06.892 --> 27:08.359
Why wouldn't I be?

27:09.528 --> 27:11.607
Come on in.

27:11.964 --> 27:13.804
Thanks.

27:14.333 --> 27:16.207
Wow.

27:16.435 --> 27:18.336
Beautiful house.

27:18.337 --> 27:20.109
Thank you.

27:21.807 --> 27:23.774
Who's the architect?

27:23.775 --> 27:25.911
Uh, my husband, actually.

27:27.012 --> 27:29.046
And the Ruscha?

27:29.047 --> 27:30.715
So are you the art collector?

27:30.716 --> 27:32.917
Uh, no, that was him too.

27:32.918 --> 27:33.918
Well, good for you.

27:33.919 --> 27:35.853
He splits, you get the
house and all the artwork.

27:37.089 --> 27:39.924
There's some more in here if
you'd like to have a look.

27:39.925 --> 27:41.726
Okay.

27:41.727 --> 27:43.601
Come on in.

27:48.100 --> 27:51.909
So you'd consider yourself
a California artist?

27:53.305 --> 27:54.805
No.

27:54.806 --> 27:57.408
No, I'm more of an
all-over kind of guy.

27:57.409 --> 27:59.710
Army brat, third generation.

27:59.711 --> 28:00.711
Oh.

28:00.712 --> 28:02.913
I signed up before
they could draft me.

28:03.815 --> 28:05.316
Well, you made it back okay.

28:05.317 --> 28:06.851
Yeah, I did.

28:06.852 --> 28:08.920
Took my time.

28:08.921 --> 28:11.322
Kind of... kind of walked back.

28:11.323 --> 28:13.157
You walked back?

28:13.158 --> 28:16.060
Well, I caught a cargo
plane to Kuala Lumpur,

28:16.061 --> 28:18.529
got on a boat to Pondicherry,

28:18.530 --> 28:20.131
went up India to Nepal,

28:20.132 --> 28:21.766
down to Karachi,

28:21.767 --> 28:23.401
across the Middle East,

28:23.402 --> 28:26.704
North Africa, spent a
little time in Morocco.

28:26.705 --> 28:28.973
I actually lived in
France for quite a while

28:28.974 --> 28:32.043
and wound up in New
York ten years later.

28:32.044 --> 28:33.044
Wow.

28:33.045 --> 28:34.745
So you came back an artist.

28:34.746 --> 28:36.948
Yeah, well, I think it was more

28:36.949 --> 28:38.616
I was looking for the one thing

28:38.617 --> 28:40.718
that would piss my
father off the most.

28:40.719 --> 28:43.554
Mm. I always envied that
bohemian lifestyle.

28:43.555 --> 28:46.891
I wanted to tramp around
the world and, you know,

28:46.892 --> 28:49.293
drink cheap wine, live in a loft.

28:49.294 --> 28:50.761
Wake up and paint?

28:50.762 --> 28:53.103
Yes, smoke Gauloises.

28:53.532 --> 28:55.766
So what stopped you?

28:55.767 --> 28:59.270
Ah. I... fell in love.

28:59.271 --> 29:00.338
Tragic.

29:00.339 --> 29:01.339
Yeah.

29:02.507 --> 29:03.608
Yes.

29:03.609 --> 29:07.144
So what did you end up
doing with yourself?

29:07.145 --> 29:09.046
Oh, this and that.

29:09.047 --> 29:11.349
You know, 9 lives, 14 professions,

29:11.350 --> 29:14.362
and I stage houses now.

29:15.387 --> 29:16.387
You stage houses?

29:16.388 --> 29:17.388
Yeah.

29:17.389 --> 29:20.658
When people want to sell their house
but they moved out and it's empty,

29:20.659 --> 29:22.159
I-I dress it.

29:22.160 --> 29:26.864
I-I make it seem lived-in so people
can imagine themselves living there.

29:26.865 --> 29:28.532
Oh.

29:28.533 --> 29:31.579
Breathe life into the emptiness.

29:35.874 --> 29:36.974
Do you have everything?

29:36.975 --> 29:37.975
Uh, yeah.

29:37.976 --> 29:39.277
Okay.

29:39.278 --> 29:40.911
Good.

29:40.912 --> 29:42.446
We'll call that a trial lesson.

29:42.447 --> 29:43.881
What do you mean?

29:43.882 --> 29:46.350
Well, I mean, you know, you
can stop now if you want.

29:46.351 --> 29:47.551
No charge.

29:47.552 --> 29:48.719
Keep the steak knives.

29:48.720 --> 29:50.755
No, that's really the
nicest afternoon

29:50.756 --> 29:52.990
I've had in a while.

29:52.991 --> 29:54.892
Good.

29:54.893 --> 29:56.594
Great.

29:56.595 --> 29:57.828
So we'll keep going.

29:57.829 --> 30:00.033
Oh, please.

30:03.201 --> 30:05.636
I'll see you, um, Thursday.

30:05.637 --> 30:07.545
Great.

30:07.639 --> 30:08.639
I look forward to it.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.548
All right. Bye.

30:13.612 --> 30:15.446
Hi, Summer. It's Mom.

30:15.447 --> 30:18.015
Um, I just was checking
in just to see,

30:18.016 --> 30:19.216
um, how you're doing.

30:19.217 --> 30:20.918
How's Josh?

30:20.919 --> 30:23.287
Anyway, um, we just
hadn't talked in a while,

30:23.288 --> 30:25.389
and I wanted to tell
you I missed you,

30:25.390 --> 30:26.390
and I love you,

30:26.391 --> 30:28.826
and, um, guess what.

30:28.827 --> 30:31.762
I-I started an art class.

30:31.763 --> 30:33.431
I know I have no skill whatsoever,

30:33.432 --> 30:36.167
but, anyway, I just am
so excited about it.

30:36.168 --> 30:37.601
I wanted to tell you.

30:37.602 --> 30:39.670
So give me a call back
when you get a chance.

30:39.671 --> 30:41.579
Bye.

30:50.315 --> 30:53.451
Hi, Roger. It's me. Hi.

30:53.452 --> 30:54.852
What are you doing?

30:54.853 --> 30:57.888
Found this lovely gourmet shop around the
corner. I went a little crazy, but, uh...

30:57.889 --> 30:59.890
Roger, I invited you.

30:59.891 --> 31:02.326
Oh, please. A lot of this stuff
I had just lying around.

31:02.327 --> 31:04.362
I was just waiting for
the right occasion.

31:04.363 --> 31:06.997
Besides, any excuse to
break out the kitsch-ware.

31:06.998 --> 31:07.998
Very cute.

31:07.999 --> 31:09.133
Yeah. It was Susan's.

31:09.134 --> 31:11.202
Her mother bought her
the complete set...

31:11.203 --> 31:13.137
shellfish butter knives.

31:13.138 --> 31:14.672
Stuff made her laugh.

31:14.673 --> 31:16.006
Yeah, stuff still makes me smile.

31:17.008 --> 31:18.008
Wow.

31:18.009 --> 31:20.277
I can't have anything
of Garrett's around.

31:20.278 --> 31:21.645
Really?

31:21.646 --> 31:22.880
No.

31:22.881 --> 31:26.784
I hid most of it or,
you know, chucked it,

31:26.785 --> 31:28.719
boxed it up right when I got back.

31:28.720 --> 31:31.222
I just purged the whole house.

31:31.223 --> 31:33.524
Just too painful.

31:33.525 --> 31:35.359
I like thinking about her.

31:35.360 --> 31:37.337
Yeah?

31:38.530 --> 31:39.530
Roger?

31:39.531 --> 31:41.198
Mm?

31:41.199 --> 31:43.745
I think I might have
found somebody.

31:44.002 --> 31:45.774
What do you mean?

31:46.338 --> 31:48.611
I met a man.

31:49.341 --> 31:50.341
That's terrific, Nikki.

31:50.342 --> 31:52.143
I'm ecstatic for you.

31:52.144 --> 31:53.878
What? You sound mad.

31:53.879 --> 31:55.079
Yeah, yeah, I guess I am.

31:55.080 --> 31:56.313
I am mad.

31:56.314 --> 31:57.681
Why?

31:58.683 --> 32:02.520
I've been asking you out for years.
I realize I'm just your neighbor.

32:02.521 --> 32:04.822
Roger, you were Garrett's friend.

32:04.823 --> 32:07.057
So what? He's dead.

32:07.058 --> 32:09.360
Susan's dead.

32:09.361 --> 32:11.595
Roger, I-I'm sorry.

32:12.998 --> 32:15.166
So is he, uh, younger?

32:15.167 --> 32:17.212
Some boy toy?

32:18.970 --> 32:21.846
- He's my type.
- Hmm.

32:27.712 --> 32:29.079
Congrats.

32:29.080 --> 32:31.557
So you've fallen in love
with somebody else.

32:32.651 --> 32:34.151
No, I-I think I'm still

32:34.152 --> 32:35.920
very much in love with Garrett.

32:35.921 --> 32:37.388
I...

32:37.389 --> 32:40.333
I'm more in love
with him than ever.

32:42.627 --> 32:44.862
You know what I remember
most about him...

32:44.863 --> 32:48.499
I mean, about finding
him when he drowned?

32:48.500 --> 32:50.968
There was sand on his lips...

32:50.969 --> 32:54.405
these little grains,
these little crystals.

32:54.406 --> 32:57.041
Isn't that weird

32:57.042 --> 32:59.713
that that's what I would remember?

34:33.304 --> 34:37.174
Annie, Annie, quite contrary.

34:37.175 --> 34:39.076
How your garden grows.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.744
With silver bells and cockle shells

34:40.745 --> 34:43.757
and one pathetic petunia.

34:44.716 --> 34:47.318
What brings you this
far east, Picasso?

34:47.319 --> 34:48.652
I was wondering if you still had

34:48.652 --> 34:50.420
any of my old painting stuff here.

34:50.422 --> 34:51.422
Ten years later?

34:51.422 --> 34:52.822
What's the inspiration?

34:52.824 --> 34:53.824
New student?

34:53.824 --> 34:57.094
I'll have you know I graduated
from students years ago.

34:57.094 --> 34:59.496
I moved on to adjunct faculty.

35:01.366 --> 35:03.411
I saw the sign out front.

35:05.370 --> 35:07.677
Are you selling the house?

35:09.240 --> 35:11.342
The price of cancer went up.

35:11.343 --> 35:12.376
- Seriously?
- I know.

35:12.377 --> 35:15.379
- I should have told you, but...
- No, no. It's your house now.

35:15.380 --> 35:17.357
It's just...

35:18.249 --> 35:19.683
Where are you guys gonna go?

35:19.684 --> 35:21.051
I don't know.

35:21.052 --> 35:22.853
The flats, I guess.

35:22.854 --> 35:24.722
Someplace cheaper.

35:24.723 --> 35:25.923
Are you okay?

35:25.924 --> 35:27.291
Yeah.

35:27.292 --> 35:28.292
Clean as a whistle.

35:28.293 --> 35:29.827
Good.

35:29.828 --> 35:31.462
- You?
- Yes.

35:31.463 --> 35:32.596
So far, so good.

35:58.990 --> 36:00.933
Wow.

36:03.862 --> 36:06.163
They're beautiful.

36:06.164 --> 36:07.164
We could paint them,

36:07.165 --> 36:09.525
but I thought they'd be
nice just to look at.

36:16.274 --> 36:18.742
Our last house had them all over...

36:18.743 --> 36:20.177
that and banana trees.

36:20.178 --> 36:22.382
God, that was a while back.

36:23.848 --> 36:25.082
Where was this?

36:25.083 --> 36:26.650
- Los Feliz.
- Oh, yeah?

36:26.651 --> 36:28.118
- I used to live up there.
- Yeah?

36:28.119 --> 36:29.687
We had to move because
of the big earthquake.

36:29.688 --> 36:31.789
- Remember that?
- '94. I sure do.

36:31.790 --> 36:32.990
It was pretty scary.

36:32.991 --> 36:34.425
Yeah. All the power went out.

36:34.426 --> 36:35.426
Yeah.

36:35.427 --> 36:37.361
It was early, right?

36:37.362 --> 36:39.396
Still dark out.

36:39.397 --> 36:40.998
Iran up to the roof,
and I looked up,

36:40.999 --> 36:44.535
and I could see the
entire Milky Way.

36:44.536 --> 36:46.937
I had run into Summer's room
right when it happened.

36:46.938 --> 36:49.440
I was so scared.

36:49.441 --> 36:51.875
Oh, her room was just destroyed.

36:51.876 --> 36:53.377
All of the books were on her bed,

36:53.378 --> 36:57.147
and then I remembered
she was at a sleepover.

36:57.148 --> 36:59.016
Who's Summer?

36:59.017 --> 37:01.218
My daughter.

37:01.219 --> 37:03.230
Oh.

37:15.467 --> 37:16.600
Nice pool.

37:16.601 --> 37:19.269
Thanks. Are you a swimmer?

37:19.270 --> 37:21.138
Yeah. I like to swim.

37:21.139 --> 37:23.841
As a matter of fact, I was
going to the Y after this.

37:23.842 --> 37:25.275
Oh.

37:25.276 --> 37:26.977
I used to love to swim.

37:26.978 --> 37:28.245
But not anymore?

37:28.246 --> 37:31.548
No, I... I don't go in the water.

37:31.549 --> 37:33.584
I don't know. I'm not
doing something right.

37:34.586 --> 37:36.286
I'm terrible.

37:36.287 --> 37:37.488
No, you're not.

37:37.489 --> 37:40.691
- I-I can't even think how to start.
- Don't think. Just look.

37:40.692 --> 37:45.095
I mean, you know, painting is...
it's seeing, so you just take it in

37:45.096 --> 37:48.108
and then... pssh!... put it down.

37:49.534 --> 37:51.807
Express yourself.

37:54.172 --> 37:55.973
You don't really care
about painting, do you?

37:57.842 --> 37:59.743
Well, not really. No.

37:59.744 --> 38:04.190
So, I mean, wh-what
are we doing here?

38:05.350 --> 38:08.118
Well, my husband liked art.

38:08.119 --> 38:09.119
But not you?

38:09.120 --> 38:11.222
No, I like to look at it.

38:12.223 --> 38:15.804
Well, maybe we could go to
some galleries together.

38:16.594 --> 38:17.761
Oh.

38:17.762 --> 38:19.534
I would like that.

38:21.499 --> 38:23.167
Yeah.

38:23.168 --> 38:25.042
You miss him, don't you?

38:26.070 --> 38:27.070
No.

38:27.071 --> 38:29.082
Not now.

38:31.042 --> 38:33.110
You know, you actually
could just swim here.

38:33.111 --> 38:34.545
You could use the pool.

38:34.546 --> 38:35.546
Really?

38:35.547 --> 38:37.683
I'll make some lunch.

38:38.216 --> 38:39.988
Okay.

38:45.657 --> 38:47.531
Hoo, boy.

39:52.190 --> 39:53.991
Hey!

39:53.992 --> 39:54.992
What?

39:54.993 --> 39:57.060
What are you doing?

39:57.061 --> 39:58.462
I was just holding my breath.

39:58.463 --> 40:00.197
God, you scared me.

40:00.198 --> 40:02.004
I'm fine.

40:03.167 --> 40:05.371
Okay.

41:57.315 --> 41:58.315
Hi.

41:58.316 --> 42:00.384
Hi.

42:00.385 --> 42:02.819
Um, uh...

42:02.820 --> 42:05.822
I, uh... I'd like to
ask you a question.

42:05.823 --> 42:08.130
Will you have dinner with me?

42:09.060 --> 42:11.995
Are you asking me on a date?

42:11.996 --> 42:13.397
Yeah. Dinner.

42:13.398 --> 42:16.137
I'd li... I want to
take you out on a date.

42:16.768 --> 42:19.136
Um, well, can I, uh...

42:19.137 --> 42:20.370
can I pick the place?

42:20.371 --> 42:22.239
Yeah, sure.

42:22.240 --> 42:24.842
Do you have to get that?

42:25.476 --> 42:26.777
No, no. It's okay.

42:26.778 --> 42:27.778
So, yeah?

42:27.779 --> 42:29.179
You'll... you'll go with me?

42:29.180 --> 42:30.347
Okay. Yes.

42:30.348 --> 42:31.448
Let's go.

42:31.449 --> 42:32.783
Okay, great.

42:32.784 --> 42:34.885
I'll talk to you later.

42:53.171 --> 42:55.772
Hey.

42:55.773 --> 42:59.042
Oh! It's so good to see you again.

42:59.043 --> 43:00.477
It's been such a long time!

43:00.478 --> 43:01.978
- Yes, it has.
- Please.

43:01.979 --> 43:02.979
Thank you.

43:02.980 --> 43:04.114
I was worried about you.

43:04.115 --> 43:05.148
Where did you go?

43:05.149 --> 43:06.349
Oh,

43:06.350 --> 43:07.484
just all over.

43:08.653 --> 43:10.353
Well, it's good to see you both.

43:10.354 --> 43:11.922
- Thank you.
- I'm glad you're back.

43:14.192 --> 43:16.226
Who does he think I am?

43:16.227 --> 43:17.561
I don't know.

43:17.562 --> 43:19.529
You've been here before.

43:19.530 --> 43:20.530
Well, yeah.

43:20.531 --> 43:22.566
Not in years, though.

43:22.567 --> 43:26.046
It's just so nice to see
things haven't changed.

43:26.404 --> 43:27.871
- Hmm?
- How is your daughter?

43:27.872 --> 43:30.340
All grown up now, yes?

43:30.341 --> 43:31.475
Yes.

43:31.476 --> 43:32.609
All grown up.

43:39.317 --> 43:43.387
So do you know what you like?

43:46.090 --> 43:48.294
I like you.

44:02.573 --> 44:05.016
Wow.

44:07.044 --> 44:08.445
Could you excuse me for a minute?

44:08.446 --> 44:10.525
What's wrong?

44:12.183 --> 44:14.194
Is something wrong?

44:24.829 --> 44:25.996
What are you doing?

44:25.997 --> 44:26.997
What are you doing?

44:26.998 --> 44:27.998
What are you doing?

44:27.999 --> 44:30.875
What are you doing?

44:38.776 --> 44:41.111
Nikki, you in there?

44:41.112 --> 44:42.612
Uh, yeah.

44:42.613 --> 44:45.420
Did I do something wrong?

44:46.017 --> 44:49.188
I've never had anyone react
that way to a kiss before.

44:50.087 --> 44:51.254
No, no, I...

44:51.255 --> 44:53.857
it's just been a while.

44:54.392 --> 44:58.303
I'm sure a let's going
through your mind.

44:58.963 --> 45:00.997
We could start over.

45:00.998 --> 45:02.872
Whatever you want to do.

45:04.402 --> 45:06.536
Um...

45:06.537 --> 45:07.537
it's not you.

45:07.538 --> 45:10.407
There's... there's just
something I have to tell you.

45:15.279 --> 45:16.446
You know what? I'm sorry.

45:16.447 --> 45:19.084
I just think you
better take me home.

45:19.684 --> 45:21.388
All right.

46:14.238 --> 46:16.539
Look, Nikki, you've had a life.

46:16.540 --> 46:18.041
I've had a life.

46:18.042 --> 46:20.110
It's selfish, but you look at me

46:20.111 --> 46:23.113
in a way that nobody
ever has before,

46:23.114 --> 46:24.714
and when I'm with you,

46:24.715 --> 46:27.884
I feel something different,

46:27.885 --> 46:30.487
and here you are.

46:30.888 --> 46:32.722
I don't really know you.

46:32.723 --> 46:34.858
You don't really know me.

46:34.859 --> 46:37.268
I guess your heart's broken...

46:38.829 --> 46:41.932
But I don't want to let you go.

46:45.336 --> 46:49.213
So where does that leave us?

47:46.297 --> 47:47.664
Hi, Summer.

47:48.999 --> 47:50.333
You got what you wanted.

47:50.334 --> 47:51.568
It's over.

47:51.569 --> 47:53.803
What's over? What are
you talking about?

47:53.804 --> 47:56.639
Me and Josh... it ended.

47:56.640 --> 48:00.176
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry.

48:00.177 --> 48:02.879
But you know what? I should give
you credit, 'cause you were right.

48:02.880 --> 48:05.391
You didn't think that
it was real, and...

48:05.883 --> 48:07.150
I guess that it wasn't.

48:07.151 --> 48:10.253
Oh, no, I... honey... I was
just trying to protect you.

48:10.254 --> 48:11.554
You know, whatever.

48:11.555 --> 48:17.304
Anyway, I was thinking I could come home
for a while and, like, keep you company.

48:17.962 --> 48:19.896
Oh, sweetie, um,

48:19.897 --> 48:22.499
I'm not so sure that's a good idea.

48:23.067 --> 48:25.502
I thought you would be
happy to have me home.

48:25.503 --> 48:27.537
Happy? No, of course I'd be happy.

48:27.538 --> 48:31.007
I just... it's... maybe
you should just stay,

48:31.008 --> 48:33.877
you know, work it
through, face it all.

48:33.878 --> 48:35.980
I don't know. I...

48:37.148 --> 48:39.382
I can't seem to get away
from him, you know?

48:39.383 --> 48:41.651
I mean, every place
that I look reminds me.

48:41.652 --> 48:45.121
And I see him constantly,
everywhere, you know?

48:45.122 --> 48:48.691
No, I understand. I do. I...

48:48.692 --> 48:51.394
Listen, honey, I have to go,
okay? Can I call you back?

48:51.395 --> 48:56.342
Well, uh... Yeah, uh, you can.

48:57.201 --> 48:58.701
Are you okay?

48:58.702 --> 49:02.272
No, I'm fine. I'm wonderful. I...
could I... I just need to call you back.

49:03.474 --> 49:04.507
Okay.

49:04.508 --> 49:06.109
Bye.

49:06.110 --> 49:07.110
Bye.

49:15.052 --> 49:17.154
You're something else.

49:18.689 --> 49:21.792
I could take a bath in
how you look at me.

49:42.746 --> 49:44.013
Hey.

49:44.014 --> 49:45.615
Hi.

49:45.616 --> 49:48.117
It's early. Something must be up.

49:48.118 --> 49:49.118
Yeah.

49:49.119 --> 49:50.820
What's her name?

49:51.822 --> 49:53.490
How did you know?

49:53.491 --> 49:56.071
Oh, you really have to ask me that?

49:56.760 --> 49:59.596
Anne, um,

49:59.597 --> 50:01.498
I think I'm out of my depth here.

50:01.499 --> 50:03.066
You?

50:03.067 --> 50:06.536
Yeah, what does it mean when
I can hardly catch my breath

50:06.537 --> 50:08.004
whenever I'm with her?

50:08.005 --> 50:11.441
And then I get this
pain in my chest.

50:11.442 --> 50:13.176
Is your arm numb?

50:13.177 --> 50:14.677
No, it's not that kind of pain.

50:14.678 --> 50:17.747
It isn't that kind of hurt.
It's a... it's a good hurt.

50:18.749 --> 50:20.984
I've never... I've never
felt like this before.

50:20.985 --> 50:23.064
Never?

50:24.588 --> 50:26.589
I thought you were mad about me.

50:26.590 --> 50:28.091
Yeah.

50:28.092 --> 50:29.826
But not like this?

50:29.827 --> 50:30.927
You won't hurt my feelings.

50:30.928 --> 50:32.295
We're friends, remember?

50:32.296 --> 50:35.498
It's... it's just different
somehow, you know?

50:35.499 --> 50:38.334
I'm so happy for you.

50:38.335 --> 50:39.536
Are you?

50:39.537 --> 50:41.271
Oh, are you kidding?

50:41.272 --> 50:43.852
I've been waiting for
this day for ten years.

50:44.275 --> 50:45.842
Thank you.

50:45.843 --> 50:48.611
And... and she knows
about the bum ticker?

50:48.612 --> 50:51.481
Why do you have to go
and spoil it like that?

50:51.482 --> 50:53.449
You know you're living
a total fantasy.

50:53.450 --> 50:56.587
I'm not dying any
more than you are.

50:57.988 --> 50:59.188
I'm sorry. That...

50:59.189 --> 51:00.256
I'm sorry.

51:00.257 --> 51:01.758
Don't be.

51:01.759 --> 51:03.993
You're right.

51:03.994 --> 51:06.096
Just thought I'd ask.

51:32.590 --> 51:34.791
- Hi.
- Hi.

51:34.792 --> 51:37.660
How are you?

51:37.661 --> 51:39.295
My God, it's just...

51:39.296 --> 51:41.531
it's like a museum.

51:41.532 --> 51:42.865
How long have you been here?

51:42.866 --> 51:45.535
Oh, I've had this place
forever, but I just...

51:45.536 --> 51:47.470
I just moved back here,

51:47.471 --> 51:49.573
oh, ten years ago.

51:50.641 --> 51:54.077
Remember when a 30-year
mortgage felt like a lifetime?

51:54.078 --> 51:56.646
Well, she's all mine,
free and clear.

51:56.647 --> 51:58.114
Uh, when my wife and I split up,

51:58.115 --> 52:00.249
I looked through the house, and...

52:23.474 --> 52:25.208
Here we go.

52:25.209 --> 52:26.209
Whoa.

52:28.145 --> 52:29.145
Nikki?

52:29.146 --> 52:31.180
- Yeah?
- You all right?

52:31.181 --> 52:32.181
I'm fine.

52:32.182 --> 52:34.762
I'm fi... I just got
a little dizzy.

52:35.152 --> 52:36.386
- You're white.
- No, no.

52:36.387 --> 52:38.287
No, it's no big deal.

52:38.288 --> 52:40.356
No, I-I just...

52:40.357 --> 52:41.357
I just need a minute.

52:42.426 --> 52:45.438
- Sure.
- Uh, it's... it's just...

52:47.531 --> 52:50.967
Just all this life, it's...

52:50.968 --> 52:53.069
all the years gone by.

52:53.070 --> 52:54.370
You sure you're okay?

52:54.371 --> 52:55.905
Yeah, I-I'm sure.

52:55.906 --> 52:57.840
Don't... don't worry.

52:58.842 --> 53:00.614
I'm fine.

53:10.888 --> 53:12.422
So what's in here?

53:12.423 --> 53:14.424
It's my studio.

53:14.425 --> 53:16.504
Wow.

53:20.230 --> 53:22.571
I just started painting again.

53:23.167 --> 53:24.634
When did you stop?

53:24.635 --> 53:26.769
Ten years ago.

53:26.770 --> 53:28.237
When your wife left you?

53:28.238 --> 53:29.839
I lost all desire.

53:29.840 --> 53:31.674
I just didn't have it anymore.

53:31.675 --> 53:32.675
Oh.

53:32.676 --> 53:34.043
And the funny thing was I...

53:34.044 --> 53:35.378
I didn't even want to look at art

53:35.379 --> 53:36.512
for the longest time.

53:36.513 --> 53:38.614
So you stopped going to museums?

53:38.615 --> 53:40.387
Yeah.

53:41.919 --> 53:44.387
You know, and then a
couple months ago, I...

53:44.388 --> 53:45.455
who knows why...

53:45.456 --> 53:47.724
I woke up in the morning,

53:47.725 --> 53:49.225
and it was... it was
back, you know?

53:49.226 --> 53:50.393
I needed it again.

53:50.394 --> 53:51.394
Hmm.

53:51.395 --> 53:53.029
And that's why I
drove over to LACMA,

53:53.030 --> 53:54.931
and I spent the whole
afternoon, and...

53:54.932 --> 53:56.199
So what's that?

53:56.200 --> 53:57.366
Is that new?

53:57.367 --> 53:59.635
That's not for today.

53:59.636 --> 54:00.670
What does that mean?

54:00.671 --> 54:02.405
It means it's not done yet.

54:02.406 --> 54:04.040
Oh. That's okay.

54:04.041 --> 54:05.041
- No.
- I'd like to...

54:05.042 --> 54:06.042
No, no, no.

54:06.043 --> 54:09.378
I-I don't want you looking at it
till it's finished. It's a surprise.

54:09.379 --> 54:11.481
Well, is it me?

54:12.416 --> 54:13.983
Is it a nude?

54:14.985 --> 54:17.997
You're gonna just
have to wait and see.

54:19.123 --> 54:21.361
Am I your muse?

54:23.293 --> 54:25.770
Wait and see.

54:42.646 --> 54:45.226
Are you looking for something?

54:45.549 --> 54:49.653
Um, I guess where
all the years went.

54:50.521 --> 54:52.588
Yeah.

54:52.589 --> 54:55.191
I hate getting older.

54:55.626 --> 54:57.727
I know I'm not
supposed to say that.

54:57.728 --> 55:00.501
What are you supposed to say?

55:02.432 --> 55:03.966
That I've grown into myself,

55:03.967 --> 55:05.701
that I...

55:05.702 --> 55:09.305
enjoy being older, wiser.

55:09.306 --> 55:11.107
But the truth is I don't.

55:11.108 --> 55:12.875
I mean, it's getting
harder and harder

55:12.876 --> 55:14.076
to look in the mirror.

55:14.077 --> 55:15.077
I know.

55:15.078 --> 55:16.746
Who is that old fart
staring back at me?

55:17.748 --> 55:18.948
Yeah. Right?

55:20.717 --> 55:22.318
You know, sometimes I
go to bed at night,

55:22.319 --> 55:23.419
and I think, "Well...

55:24.421 --> 55:25.988
There goes another
one, another day."

55:25.989 --> 55:28.125
- Mm-hmm.
- "Another year."

55:29.026 --> 55:30.526
And I'm not sad about it.

55:30.527 --> 55:32.295
I'm not scared.

55:32.296 --> 55:35.240
It's just...

55:35.365 --> 55:36.833
Sobering.

55:36.834 --> 55:40.036
And I'll catch myself walking
backwards into the sunset.

55:40.037 --> 55:42.338
Oh, waxing sentimental.

55:42.339 --> 55:48.389
Yeah, I'm feeling... you know, thinking
about all the good times and bad times.

55:48.912 --> 55:51.583
Yeah, I think about
how happy we were.

55:53.917 --> 55:57.731
It's been a long time since I thought
something good could happen.

55:59.590 --> 56:01.225
Hmm.

56:02.292 --> 56:04.560
Well,

56:04.561 --> 56:08.404
everything is possible now, okay?

56:09.399 --> 56:11.167
Summer's gone.

56:11.168 --> 56:12.869
We're on our own.

56:12.870 --> 56:15.143
I spent my whole life
looking for you.

56:16.707 --> 56:19.141
I can't believe I found you.

56:19.142 --> 56:21.949
I found you, remember?

56:45.936 --> 56:47.603
Nikki.

56:47.604 --> 56:49.372
I got the basil.

56:49.373 --> 56:50.640
What else do we need?

56:50.641 --> 56:52.008
Nikki!

56:52.009 --> 56:53.309
Hey, Nikki!

56:53.310 --> 56:55.244
Nikki, wait up!

56:56.246 --> 56:57.713
- You didn't hear me?
- I'm sorry.

56:57.714 --> 56:59.649
- You all right?
- No, I'm fine.

56:59.650 --> 57:01.817
I'm fine. What are you doing here?

57:01.818 --> 57:03.352
What do you mean what
am I doing here?

57:03.353 --> 57:06.289
I've been coming here for years. I mean,
we used to come here together, you know?

57:06.290 --> 57:09.392
- I mean, Susan and I, you and Garrett.
- Oh, of course. That's right.

57:09.393 --> 57:10.393
That's right.

57:11.395 --> 57:12.762
I've been calling you.

57:12.763 --> 57:13.796
- Oh, you have?
- Yeah.

57:13.797 --> 57:14.964
Oh, I'm sorry.

57:14.965 --> 57:18.200
Oh, no, I'm sorry. I just, uh...
I miss you.

57:18.201 --> 57:20.102
Oh, I miss you too.

57:20.103 --> 57:22.538
So, is the, uh... the
new friend here?

57:22.539 --> 57:23.539
No. No, he's not.

57:23.540 --> 57:24.840
- No?
- No.

57:24.841 --> 57:26.709
Well, maybe we can
grab lunch sometime.

57:26.710 --> 57:27.877
I would love that.

57:27.878 --> 57:30.079
- You know, just as friends.
- Yes, yes. I would love that.

57:30.080 --> 57:33.082
- I'll... I'll call you. I promise.
- Can I... can I tell you something?

57:33.083 --> 57:34.283
Yeah.

57:34.284 --> 57:36.795
I'm sorry I made things awkward.

57:37.254 --> 57:38.921
Yeah, it's just all those years

57:38.922 --> 57:41.290
of seeing you and Garrett...
what you had...

57:41.291 --> 57:43.359
I mean, you guys lit up a room.

57:43.360 --> 57:45.194
I just wanted a little
of that for myself.

57:45.195 --> 57:46.462
I hope you understand.

57:46.463 --> 57:48.731
I do. I do, Roger.

57:48.732 --> 57:50.066
- Thanks.
- Okay.

57:50.067 --> 57:51.067
- See you.
- Okay.

57:51.068 --> 57:53.079
Take care of yourself.

57:56.640 --> 57:57.640
What was that all about?

57:57.641 --> 57:59.241
Oh, sorry.

57:59.242 --> 58:00.509
You don't even introduce me?

58:00.510 --> 58:02.378
What? Well, that was Roger.

58:02.379 --> 58:03.379
Roger who?

58:03.380 --> 58:04.847
Oh, he... he was a friend of ours.

58:04.848 --> 58:06.248
You don't introduce me to him?

58:06.249 --> 58:07.984
I'm sorry. He was a
friend of Garrett's.

58:07.985 --> 58:10.119
So what? Garrett left you.

58:10.120 --> 58:12.256
I mean, the hell with him.

58:13.256 --> 58:14.724
I don't understand.

58:14.725 --> 58:16.058
Well, I'm just...

58:16.059 --> 58:18.327
I'm... I... I'm just not ready.

58:18.328 --> 58:19.862
Ready for what?

58:19.863 --> 58:21.497
I-I just am...

58:21.498 --> 58:25.944
I'm not ready to share
you with everyone.

59:14.584 --> 59:15.818
I've always been a big fan

59:15.819 --> 59:19.423
of the besotted
Southern writer look.

59:21.324 --> 59:23.369
You want me to try one on?

59:27.564 --> 59:29.643
- Mm.
- Let's go in.

59:44.548 --> 59:46.491
What do you think?

59:47.417 --> 59:49.118
Oh.

59:49.119 --> 59:50.619
I think I need a bow tie.

59:50.620 --> 59:52.500
You know how to do one of these?

59:53.190 --> 59:55.269
Yeah.

59:59.629 --> 01:00:01.864
Mummy and I just returned
from the Hamptons.

01:00:01.865 --> 01:00:05.301
Kit's become, gosh, such
a striking creature.

01:00:05.302 --> 01:00:08.678
Muffy gave Scotty a
yacht for graduation.

01:00:17.714 --> 01:00:19.691
Garrett.

01:00:21.351 --> 01:00:22.451
Aw, Jesus.

01:00:22.452 --> 01:00:25.532
What, are you getting
back with him?

01:00:26.356 --> 01:00:28.765
No. He didn't leave me.

01:00:29.392 --> 01:00:31.393
So you're seeing him again?

01:00:31.394 --> 01:00:33.729
Yes.

01:00:33.730 --> 01:00:34.730
No.

01:00:34.731 --> 01:00:36.265
No.

01:00:36.266 --> 01:00:37.700
That's why you're hiding me?

01:00:37.701 --> 01:00:39.768
'Cause...'cause you're
back with your husband?

01:00:39.769 --> 01:00:41.237
No, no.

01:00:41.238 --> 01:00:43.647
He's dead.

01:00:43.974 --> 01:00:45.107
He's dead?

01:00:45.108 --> 01:00:47.346
He died.

01:00:47.410 --> 01:00:50.752
- Well...
- I couldn't tell you.

01:00:51.114 --> 01:00:53.318
Why not?

01:00:54.885 --> 01:00:58.227
You wanted me to believe
that he'd just run away?

01:00:58.522 --> 01:01:00.533
I'm sorry.

01:01:01.291 --> 01:01:03.292
All this time?

01:01:03.293 --> 01:01:05.094
I planned to tell you. I did.

01:01:05.095 --> 01:01:07.800
I just never found the right...

01:01:08.198 --> 01:01:09.765
You lied to me.

01:01:09.766 --> 01:01:12.406
I mean, why would you lie
about something like that?

01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:15.237
- Because I...
- Huh?

01:01:15.238 --> 01:01:18.876
I just didn't want it to be true.

01:01:19.743 --> 01:01:21.710
God, that's horrible.

01:01:21.711 --> 01:01:24.346
When did this happen? Recently?

01:01:24.347 --> 01:01:25.814
It was a while ago.

01:01:25.815 --> 01:01:27.883
It was...

01:01:27.884 --> 01:01:30.553
It was years ago... five years ago.

01:01:30.554 --> 01:01:33.259
He drowned.

01:01:34.124 --> 01:01:36.692
I'm sorry.

01:01:36.693 --> 01:01:38.636
I'm sorry.

01:01:38.895 --> 01:01:42.339
And you're... you're
still not, um...

01:01:44.901 --> 01:01:47.105
You're still not over him?

01:01:48.104 --> 01:01:50.809
No.

01:01:55.679 --> 01:01:58.555
I'm gonna get out of this suit.

01:03:33.443 --> 01:03:35.545
Nikki!

01:03:42.519 --> 01:03:44.826
- Let's sit down.
- All right.

01:03:48.591 --> 01:03:50.693
Look.

01:03:51.961 --> 01:03:53.929
I've been married too.

01:03:53.930 --> 01:03:56.942
You say you love your husband.

01:03:57.801 --> 01:04:00.002
Of course you do.

01:04:00.003 --> 01:04:01.837
But he's dead,

01:04:01.838 --> 01:04:04.473
and I'm right here.

01:04:04.474 --> 01:04:07.145
Right now.

01:04:08.945 --> 01:04:11.447
And I love you.

01:04:11.448 --> 01:04:13.082
You.

01:04:13.083 --> 01:04:15.890
I've always loved you.

01:04:53.990 --> 01:04:56.592
Who the hell is that?

01:04:58.194 --> 01:05:00.068
I don't know.

01:05:00.797 --> 01:05:03.035
Maybe they'll go away.

01:05:46.443 --> 01:05:48.043
Nikki.

01:05:48.044 --> 01:05:50.419
There's a girl down there.

01:05:50.814 --> 01:05:51.980
What?

01:05:51.981 --> 01:05:54.527
There's some girl down there.

01:05:55.385 --> 01:05:57.396
Where?

01:06:00.457 --> 01:06:01.623
That's Summer.

01:06:01.624 --> 01:06:04.226
That's my daughter.

01:06:14.537 --> 01:06:16.505
How did you get here?

01:06:16.506 --> 01:06:18.173
I drove.

01:06:18.174 --> 01:06:21.345
Honey. From Seattle?

01:06:21.611 --> 01:06:22.744
Yeah.

01:06:22.745 --> 01:06:24.246
Nice to see you too.

01:06:24.247 --> 01:06:27.216
Well... well, how long
did that take you?

01:06:27.217 --> 01:06:30.285
Oh, like, 18 hours straight.

01:06:30.286 --> 01:06:32.421
Yeah, well, why did you do that?

01:06:32.422 --> 01:06:33.422
I don't know.

01:06:33.423 --> 01:06:35.591
You, like, said not to come,

01:06:35.592 --> 01:06:38.103
so I thought, "Somethings up."

01:06:44.601 --> 01:06:46.468
Guess I should have called.

01:06:46.469 --> 01:06:48.103
No, honey.

01:06:48.104 --> 01:06:49.438
Well, you have company.

01:06:49.439 --> 01:06:51.206
No, it... it...

01:06:51.207 --> 01:06:52.474
you'll like him.

01:06:52.475 --> 01:06:55.043
It's okay.

01:06:55.044 --> 01:06:57.579
Well, that's weird.

01:06:57.580 --> 01:06:58.580
What?

01:06:58.581 --> 01:07:00.148
You with somebody else.

01:07:00.149 --> 01:07:01.917
But it's not like that.

01:07:01.918 --> 01:07:03.819
Well, I mean, I'm not saying...

01:07:03.820 --> 01:07:05.287
Come on. Whatever.

01:07:05.288 --> 01:07:06.655
It's been five years.

01:07:06.656 --> 01:07:08.357
You know? I'm over it.

01:07:08.358 --> 01:07:10.369
No, you're not.

01:07:11.928 --> 01:07:14.630
How long have you
been seeing this guy?

01:07:14.631 --> 01:07:16.298
Just a little while.

01:07:16.299 --> 01:07:17.332
Oh.

01:07:17.333 --> 01:07:19.368
Does he make you forget about Dad?

01:07:19.369 --> 01:07:22.279
No.

01:07:26.442 --> 01:07:28.919
What... uh, what does he do?

01:07:29.646 --> 01:07:31.246
He's a painter.

01:07:31.247 --> 01:07:32.414
Like, houses?

01:07:32.415 --> 01:07:33.849
No, no... art.

01:07:33.850 --> 01:07:35.017
Oh, wow.

01:07:35.018 --> 01:07:37.222
Well, Dad would have loved that.

01:07:38.688 --> 01:07:40.022
What's his name?

01:07:40.023 --> 01:07:42.190
Wait. I-I just... I...

01:07:42.191 --> 01:07:43.492
I need him.

01:07:43.493 --> 01:07:44.826
- Yeah.
- Okay? I...

01:07:44.827 --> 01:07:45.827
Mom, I'm not mad.

01:07:45.828 --> 01:07:47.529
No, I just want you to understand.

01:07:47.530 --> 01:07:48.530
Yeah.

01:07:48.531 --> 01:07:51.366
Mom, it's not like I
want you to be alone

01:07:51.367 --> 01:07:52.734
for the rest of your life.

01:07:52.735 --> 01:07:53.735
No, I know. I know.

01:07:53.736 --> 01:07:55.604
I just...

01:07:55.605 --> 01:07:57.506
Your father was the
love of my life.

01:07:57.507 --> 01:07:58.507
Yeah.

01:07:58.508 --> 01:08:00.644
I know.

01:08:01.344 --> 01:08:03.211
Come on. What's his name?

01:08:03.212 --> 01:08:04.980
Let's... let's meet him.

01:08:04.981 --> 01:08:05.981
What's his name?

01:08:05.982 --> 01:08:07.916
I-I just want you to
accept him, okay?

01:08:07.917 --> 01:08:10.218
Yes. Okay. I'm not a jerk.

01:08:10.219 --> 01:08:11.219
What am I gonna do?

01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:13.155
Honey, I just got to
tell you something.

01:08:13.156 --> 01:08:16.925
Hi. You must be Summer.

01:08:16.926 --> 01:08:18.527
I'm Tom.

01:08:21.464 --> 01:08:24.131
I know. I-I know. I just couldn't
believe it when I saw him.

01:08:24.934 --> 01:08:27.402
Oh, my God.

01:08:27.403 --> 01:08:29.770
Jesus Christ.

01:08:29.772 --> 01:08:31.773
- What are you doing?
- What?

01:08:31.774 --> 01:08:33.609
Get out. Get out of here.

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:34.609
- Oh, Summer...
- No! Get out of here.

01:08:34.611 --> 01:08:36.612
- Summer, now, stop.
- You're... a freak.

01:08:36.613 --> 01:08:38.846
- What? Don't say that.
- Mom, what are you doing?

01:08:38.848 --> 01:08:41.183
What is going on? Who are you?

01:08:41.184 --> 01:08:42.184
- Wait.
- I'm sorry.

01:08:42.185 --> 01:08:43.318
- What?
- Honey...

01:08:43.319 --> 01:08:44.720
- Is this for real?
- No, no, no... no, no.

01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:46.188
Get him out of here!
Get him out of here!

01:08:46.189 --> 01:08:47.589
- Leave him alone!
- Just stop it.

01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:48.957
- Hey!
- No, this is sick.

01:08:48.957 --> 01:08:49.957
- Stop it!
- This is sick!

01:08:49.959 --> 01:08:51.593
- Stop!
- No, you Stop it!

01:08:51.594 --> 01:08:53.395
- Stop it!
- Get your face out of here!

01:08:53.395 --> 01:08:54.830
- Stop it!
- Get out!

01:08:54.831 --> 01:08:56.064
Get out!

01:08:56.064 --> 01:08:58.500
- Summer, stop it!
- Please!

01:08:58.501 --> 01:08:59.568
Mom!

01:08:59.569 --> 01:09:01.470
Get out of the house.

01:09:01.470 --> 01:09:02.904
- What?
- Get out of the house!

01:09:02.904 --> 01:09:05.040
- I want you to leave now!
- All right, I'm going. I'm leaving.

01:09:05.041 --> 01:09:06.675
No, you're not.

01:09:06.676 --> 01:09:08.010
- Mom!
- What?

01:09:08.011 --> 01:09:10.612
- I told you. I need him.
- I'll be back later.

01:09:10.613 --> 01:09:13.482
- No, you're not coming back!
- Leave, Summer, now! Please.

01:09:13.483 --> 01:09:15.951
- Nikki... Nikki, I'm going.
- Yeah, that's right!

01:09:15.952 --> 01:09:17.895
Garrett, please!

01:09:19.421 --> 01:09:24.268
It's Tom. It's okay. I'll go.

01:09:48.017 --> 01:09:50.028
Hello.

01:09:51.087 --> 01:09:53.359
I'm so sorry.

01:09:53.723 --> 01:09:55.825
What was that all about?

01:09:57.827 --> 01:09:59.494
She's young.

01:09:59.495 --> 01:10:01.163
She... she's having a hard time.

01:10:01.164 --> 01:10:02.164
She misses her dad.

01:10:02.165 --> 01:10:05.200
She sees me with another man.

01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:07.405
Uh-huh.

01:10:08.371 --> 01:10:10.639
Come with me.

01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:12.441
Where?

01:10:12.442 --> 01:10:14.409
Mexico.

01:10:14.410 --> 01:10:17.217
I want to go to Mexico.

01:10:17.647 --> 01:10:19.114
What, now?

01:10:19.115 --> 01:10:21.850
No. No, in the morning.

01:10:21.851 --> 01:10:24.488
We can go to the airport.

01:10:26.055 --> 01:10:29.024
I don't think your daughter's
gonna like that too much.

01:10:29.025 --> 01:10:30.459
No, no. It's okay.

01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:34.234
We'll go early, before she's awake.

01:11:20.143 --> 01:11:21.476
Hi.

01:11:21.477 --> 01:11:22.778
- Cab's here.
- Cab's here? Okay.

01:11:22.779 --> 01:11:23.779
Come on in.

01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:25.347
Okay.

01:11:25.348 --> 01:11:27.315
Hey.

01:11:27.316 --> 01:11:30.226
She's asleep. I'm ready.

01:11:38.127 --> 01:11:40.028
Here, let me get that for you.

01:11:40.029 --> 01:11:42.006
Thanks.

01:12:47.897 --> 01:12:52.411
Oh, it is so beautiful, isn't it?

01:12:53.035 --> 01:12:54.836
The pool is amazing.

01:12:54.837 --> 01:12:55.837
You're gonna love it.

01:12:55.838 --> 01:12:57.839
Please, no swimming in the
ocean today, friends.

01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:59.207
There could be a riptide.

01:12:59.208 --> 01:13:01.287
It's very dangerous.

01:13:10.753 --> 01:13:12.520
The concierge is available
at your request.

01:13:12.521 --> 01:13:14.464
Great.

01:13:15.458 --> 01:13:16.958
<i>Gracias, seÃ±or.</i>

01:13:16.959 --> 01:13:19.266
Enjoy your stay.

01:13:24.567 --> 01:13:26.874
Oh.

01:13:28.237 --> 01:13:30.772
Oh, it's perfect.

01:13:30.773 --> 01:13:32.207
Do you want to go fishing?

01:13:32.208 --> 01:13:33.208
We could do that.

01:13:33.209 --> 01:13:34.476
We could charter a boat.

01:13:34.477 --> 01:13:37.879
Haven't you always wanted
to go deep-sea fishing?

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:39.915
No, not really.

01:13:39.916 --> 01:13:41.683
Oh.

01:13:41.684 --> 01:13:43.018
Well, that's okay.

01:13:43.019 --> 01:13:44.019
We'll just hang out.

01:13:45.187 --> 01:13:47.489
You know, sunbathe,

01:13:47.490 --> 01:13:50.764
eat, make love.

01:14:02.939 --> 01:14:05.644
Did you used to come down
here with your husband?

01:14:06.976 --> 01:14:08.310
Uh, well,

01:14:08.311 --> 01:14:11.713
the whole family
practically every year.

01:14:11.714 --> 01:14:14.351
That's not weird for you?

01:14:14.951 --> 01:14:16.952
No.

01:14:16.953 --> 01:14:19.120
How long since you've
been down here?

01:14:19.121 --> 01:14:22.497
Um... oh, years.

01:14:27.863 --> 01:14:30.636
Since he died.

01:14:31.467 --> 01:14:33.603
Uh-huh.

01:14:34.804 --> 01:14:36.747
Did he die here?

01:14:38.574 --> 01:14:40.208
Uh-huh.

01:14:40.209 --> 01:14:42.311
Nikki...

01:14:43.446 --> 01:14:45.616
What are we doing?

01:14:46.849 --> 01:14:49.451
Making new memories.

01:15:02.665 --> 01:15:05.133
I-I love this.

01:15:05.134 --> 01:15:07.002
I just love it here.

01:15:07.003 --> 01:15:08.670
Can you believe it?

01:15:08.671 --> 01:15:12.040
Mexico... it's still here for
us after all these years.

01:15:12.041 --> 01:15:14.621
You know, what I really
want is some tequila.

01:15:15.778 --> 01:15:18.380
And then you're gonna
dance with me.

01:15:34.397 --> 01:15:35.663
<i>Hola, seÃ±or.</i>

01:15:35.664 --> 01:15:36.664
<i>SÃ­, seÃ±or?</i>

01:15:36.665 --> 01:15:38.299
<i>Dos tequilas, por favor.</i>

01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:39.367
Oh, yeah?

01:15:39.368 --> 01:15:41.736
Something <i>muy especial.</i>

01:15:41.737 --> 01:15:44.044
<i>- Bueno.
- Gracias.</i>

01:16:30.286 --> 01:16:31.886
<i>SeÃ±or!</i>

01:16:31.887 --> 01:16:34.489
Your tequila!

01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:46.709
Are they bringing the drinks?

01:16:50.706 --> 01:16:53.074
What was your husband like?

01:16:53.075 --> 01:16:55.443
You never really told me.

01:16:55.444 --> 01:16:57.445
What?

01:16:57.446 --> 01:16:59.684
We're not here to talk about him.

01:17:00.015 --> 01:17:02.390
He's always been this big mystery.

01:17:02.918 --> 01:17:05.122
Well, you don't have to be jealous.

01:17:05.855 --> 01:17:07.622
I'm not jealous. Why
would I be jealous?

01:17:07.623 --> 01:17:10.203
I don't know.

01:17:10.459 --> 01:17:12.561
Because he's dead.

01:17:13.229 --> 01:17:14.429
What are you doing?

01:17:14.430 --> 01:17:15.430
No, tell me about him.

01:17:15.431 --> 01:17:17.465
I mean...

01:17:17.466 --> 01:17:20.012
you know, do I remind you of him?

01:17:20.202 --> 01:17:21.803
No.

01:17:22.905 --> 01:17:26.179
Is it my laugh? My voice?

01:17:26.308 --> 01:17:28.478
Why are you doing this?

01:17:30.246 --> 01:17:32.348
Do I look like him?

01:17:35.918 --> 01:17:38.555
Do I look like him, Nikki?

01:17:38.621 --> 01:17:40.222
No.

01:17:41.190 --> 01:17:43.394
Yeah, I do.

01:17:45.027 --> 01:17:47.698
I look just like him.

01:17:48.297 --> 01:17:51.707
You have no idea
what he looks like.

01:17:58.908 --> 01:18:01.488
It was on the wall by the bar.

01:18:02.778 --> 01:18:04.412
Well, it's you.

01:18:04.413 --> 01:18:06.651
It must be you.

01:18:31.373 --> 01:18:33.384
Nikki!

01:18:37.112 --> 01:18:39.316
Nikki!

01:19:13.549 --> 01:19:14.682
- Nikki.
- Let go!

01:19:14.683 --> 01:19:17.151
- Come on.
- Let go!

01:19:17.152 --> 01:19:19.197
Nikki.

01:19:38.040 --> 01:19:40.347
This was stupid.

01:19:40.509 --> 01:19:41.609
Why did you do that?

01:19:41.610 --> 01:19:42.877
Why did you leave me?

01:19:42.878 --> 01:19:43.878
Nikki.

01:19:43.879 --> 01:19:45.613
They told you not to
go in there, Garrett!

01:19:45.614 --> 01:19:46.614
They told you!

01:19:46.615 --> 01:19:50.118
And... and you... and you
get high, you bastard.

01:19:50.119 --> 01:19:51.152
You bastard.

01:19:51.153 --> 01:19:52.153
You're right.

01:19:52.154 --> 01:19:53.888
- You just... you could have died.
- You're right.

01:19:53.889 --> 01:19:55.356
You could have drowned!

01:19:55.357 --> 01:19:56.457
You're right.

01:19:56.458 --> 01:19:58.059
I'm sorry.

01:19:58.060 --> 01:19:59.527
Nikki, I'm so sorry.

01:19:59.528 --> 01:20:01.396
Oh, I love you so much.

01:20:01.397 --> 01:20:03.031
Please don't leave me.

01:20:03.032 --> 01:20:04.565
Please don't leave me.

01:20:04.566 --> 01:20:07.268
Please don't leave me.

01:20:09.972 --> 01:20:12.040
I just thought I lost you.

01:20:12.041 --> 01:20:13.174
I thought you were gone.

01:20:13.175 --> 01:20:14.942
I'm here... right here.

01:20:51.146 --> 01:20:53.147
Tom?

01:20:53.148 --> 01:20:55.616
Hmm.

01:20:55.617 --> 01:20:59.164
I think that's the first
time you ever said my name.

01:21:06.261 --> 01:21:08.636
Did you ever love me?

01:21:09.865 --> 01:21:12.069
I do love you.

01:21:14.269 --> 01:21:16.771
I love you too.

01:21:20.442 --> 01:21:22.851
Am I bad person?

01:21:23.779 --> 01:21:26.017
No.

01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:30.523
No.

01:21:48.437 --> 01:21:50.778
It's okay.

01:22:21.336 --> 01:22:23.938
Ohh.

01:22:36.585 --> 01:22:38.653
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:22:38.654 --> 01:22:40.455
We need to talk.

01:22:40.456 --> 01:22:42.535
You think?

01:22:59.374 --> 01:23:02.710
I mean, sometimes it's nice
just being "in like," you know?

01:23:02.711 --> 01:23:05.179
Why didn't you and Mom
ever get together?

01:23:05.180 --> 01:23:07.148
Oh.

01:23:07.149 --> 01:23:09.550
No, we're better off as friends.

01:23:09.551 --> 01:23:11.719
I give "great friend."

01:23:11.720 --> 01:23:12.887
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:23:12.888 --> 01:23:14.121
Mom, do you remember that time

01:23:14.122 --> 01:23:16.290
that we went up to, um, Big Bear,

01:23:16.291 --> 01:23:18.493
and Dad made a Venus
de Milo out of snow?

01:23:19.761 --> 01:23:22.597
I just remember you couldn't
keep your hands off her breasts.

01:23:22.598 --> 01:23:24.332
They were shiny.

01:23:25.334 --> 01:23:27.802
I could totally go for a white
Christmas again next year.

01:23:27.803 --> 01:23:29.770
- Yeah?
- You want to?

01:23:29.771 --> 01:23:32.373
I would love that.

01:23:39.114 --> 01:23:41.751
Hey, is this that guy?

01:23:42.818 --> 01:23:43.951
Who?

01:23:43.952 --> 01:23:48.728
You know, the guy
that looks like Dad?

01:23:51.159 --> 01:23:52.460
What is that?

01:23:52.461 --> 01:23:55.871
Invitation to an art gallery, or...

01:23:56.665 --> 01:23:57.665
No, it's...

01:23:59.601 --> 01:24:01.680
It's a memorial.

01:24:30.399 --> 01:24:32.400
Nikki?

01:24:32.401 --> 01:24:34.468
Oh, I was hoping you would come.

01:24:34.469 --> 01:24:35.970
Hi.

01:24:35.971 --> 01:24:37.872
I'm, uh... I'm... I'm Anne.

01:24:37.873 --> 01:24:40.154
I'm the ex-wife. I'm sure you've
heard the horror stories.

01:24:41.276 --> 01:24:44.220
Um, how did you recognize me?

01:24:45.180 --> 01:24:47.782
Come with me.

01:24:51.620 --> 01:24:56.624
These are all new, just in
the last year... since you.

01:24:56.625 --> 01:24:58.636
All of these?

01:25:00.829 --> 01:25:03.731
Anne, what... what happened?

01:25:03.732 --> 01:25:07.468
Oh, well, he'd been sick
for a long time, you know.

01:25:07.469 --> 01:25:09.878
He never told me.

01:25:10.372 --> 01:25:12.849
He didn't want you to know.
