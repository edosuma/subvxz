WEBVTT

00:14.308 --> 00:15.896
- Spyro?
- John!

00:15.896 --> 00:17.759
This chick Ash, she says
you got violent with her,

00:17.759 --> 00:18.760
you broke her jaw.

00:18.760 --> 00:20.486
Don't deny it Spyro,
I fucking know you.

00:20.486 --> 00:21.798
You can't do that anymore.

00:25.319 --> 00:26.251
Sam's in jail.

00:26.389 --> 00:27.493
And I don't
want him coming out.

00:27.493 --> 00:28.736
Neither do you.

00:28.736 --> 00:30.911
- I can fix the problem.
- What? Permanently?

00:34.673 --> 00:35.950
Who sent you?

00:35.950 --> 00:38.021
I don't know.
Some Asian prick!

00:38.021 --> 00:40.161
So you know anything about
this contract on Sam?

00:40.161 --> 00:41.783
No.

00:50.171 --> 00:52.449
I can't believe
you fucking shot him.

00:52.449 --> 00:53.692
Well what the fuck was I
supposed to do.

00:53.692 --> 00:55.832
We are fucked.
Do you know that. Fuck!

00:55.832 --> 00:57.592
The cops are asking
about the shooting.

00:57.592 --> 01:00.078
Those gooks won't stop until
they find out who did it.

01:00.078 --> 01:01.976
The Viets,
they think Sam did it.

01:01.976 --> 01:03.460
Tried to kill him
for it too.

01:03.460 --> 01:05.393
The people who actually did it,
they need to fix it.

01:05.393 --> 01:07.361
It'll be fixed.

01:18.027 --> 01:19.960
The Cross is a fucking circus,

01:20.581 --> 01:22.410
and John just makes sure
it's not being run by clowns,

01:22.410 --> 01:23.549
that's all.

01:23.687 --> 01:27.105
Right, so you'd say
he's the boss then, yeah?

01:27.105 --> 01:28.175
Top of the totem pole?

01:28.175 --> 01:29.797
We're trying
to help you Waali.

01:29.797 --> 01:31.557
That's what indemnity
is all about.

01:31.557 --> 01:34.112
But we can't make that happen
if you don't hold up your end.

01:34.112 --> 01:35.561
What the fuck
you think I'm doing here?

01:35.561 --> 01:37.184
Honestly! What do I think
you're doing here?

01:37.184 --> 01:39.151
I think you're wasting
our fucking time

01:39.151 --> 01:40.981
in telling us things
we already know.

01:40.981 --> 01:43.673
Hoping it'll take care of your
drugs charge, which it won't.

01:43.673 --> 01:47.815
We can only help you if you
tell us what we don't know.

01:47.815 --> 01:51.439
Starting with ya mate.
John Ibrahim.

01:52.854 --> 01:54.615
Thanks mate.
Keep the change.

01:54.615 --> 01:56.444
Cheers mate.

02:04.176 --> 02:07.145
When I said I wanted to
take you out...

02:08.422 --> 02:10.389
...I meant,
I wanted to take you out.

02:10.389 --> 02:11.873
I know.

02:12.081 --> 02:13.392
I'm not saying I
don't love the whole,

02:13.392 --> 02:15.877
you know, al fresco thing,
it's just...

02:15.877 --> 02:18.984
But it's not cool enough for a
first date with John Ibrahim.

02:20.917 --> 02:22.332
Full name, huh?

02:23.644 --> 02:25.646
I just didn't want
our first date to be

02:25.646 --> 02:28.683
some other place you'd
gone to, some other time.

02:33.585 --> 02:35.138
Why, do you think
you're special? Or...

02:35.138 --> 02:36.415
Hmm, maybe.

02:36.415 --> 02:39.280
Play your cards right,
and you might find out.

03:22.323 --> 03:24.222
Can I ask you something?

03:27.777 --> 03:29.641
About an eight and a half.

03:30.055 --> 03:31.298
Excuse me.

03:31.298 --> 03:35.025
I mean, a few more minutes and
you could've cracked a nine.

03:35.025 --> 03:38.443
- I'm serious.
- Yeah, so am I.

03:38.443 --> 03:41.204
I don't know, I feel like you
rushed it at the end a little.

03:51.904 --> 03:53.768
You don't
remember me, do you?

03:55.908 --> 03:58.152
Yeah. You're the girl
who loves hotdogs.

03:58.152 --> 04:00.568
Not going to forget
that in a hurry.

04:00.706 --> 04:05.021
Oh, I met you when
I was like, just a kid.

04:06.436 --> 04:07.989
You were clubbing underage?

04:07.989 --> 04:09.198
No, you idiot.

04:09.198 --> 04:11.131
You came to our food shop.

04:13.305 --> 04:16.826
You gave my mum an
envelope full of money.

04:17.413 --> 04:20.657
And then every month after
that, some big islander guy

04:20.657 --> 04:22.107
would do the same.

04:23.902 --> 04:25.835
You were friends
with my brother.

04:28.044 --> 04:29.804
You are...

04:32.359 --> 04:34.740
...Spyro's little sister?

04:37.950 --> 04:40.746
Mum always said that
you were some kind of saint

04:40.746 --> 04:43.439
for what you did for us
after he died.

04:46.062 --> 04:48.133
She's going to flip.

04:53.345 --> 04:55.451
But what were you
going to ask me?

04:56.797 --> 04:58.178
It's nothing.

05:29.692 --> 05:32.212
The judge
investigating police corruption

05:32.212 --> 05:35.939
in New South Wales, says it's
time to rebuild the service.

05:36.146 --> 05:37.424
What many are calling

05:37.424 --> 05:39.253
the most
consequentially inquiry

05:39.253 --> 05:41.669
in the history of the
State's Police Force.

05:41.669 --> 05:45.121
Headed up by Supreme Court
Justice, Bernard Jones.

05:45.121 --> 05:47.606
Allegations of corruption
continue to reach

05:47.606 --> 05:50.264
into the highest levels
of the police force.

05:50.816 --> 05:51.955
For corrupt police,

05:51.955 --> 05:54.337
it's the last chance
to escape prosecution.

05:54.337 --> 05:56.788
The Commission's hope is that
the evidence gathered

05:56.788 --> 06:00.170
will go to the heart of
corruption wherever it resides,

06:00.170 --> 06:02.897
from the police station
to the corridors of power,

06:02.897 --> 06:05.245
until the cancer that has
riddled the State,

06:05.245 --> 06:06.591
has been cut out.

06:06.591 --> 06:08.075
And while the Royal Commission

06:08.075 --> 06:10.974
into police corruption begins
in public hearings today,

06:10.974 --> 06:13.598
the inquiry itself
began some time ago.

06:13.598 --> 06:15.358
It announced
a limited amnesty

06:15.358 --> 06:18.741
to corrupt officers, giving
them 10 weeks to come forward.

06:18.741 --> 06:21.537
It's part of a radical plan
to purge the police service.

06:21.537 --> 06:23.297
Police involved
in heinous crime

06:23.297 --> 06:25.437
like murder and serious
drug trafficking,

06:25.437 --> 06:26.438
need not apply.

06:26.438 --> 06:28.682
Okay. Okay.

06:28.682 --> 06:31.581
Yes. No.
Okay. Walk away.

06:31.581 --> 06:33.790
Increasingly
concessions, all of which

06:33.790 --> 06:35.792
are helping to convince
corrupt officers

06:35.792 --> 06:38.864
and their criminal cohort,
to work with the Commission,

06:38.864 --> 06:41.419
rather than risk becoming
part of the fallout.

06:41.419 --> 06:42.868
Other police
rolling over,

06:42.868 --> 06:44.594
to describe 'the laugh',

06:44.594 --> 06:46.803
a system of bribes
in Kings Cross,

06:46.803 --> 06:48.736
that raked in millions.

06:56.744 --> 06:59.713
Ahead of today's
Royal Commission hearing,

06:59.713 --> 07:02.819
Justice Jones had a message
for those taking the stand.

07:02.819 --> 07:05.270
A word to those
who doubt my conviction.

07:05.270 --> 07:08.100
If you are involved in
corruption and

07:08.100 --> 07:13.658
you think that you are somehow
untouchable, you are not.

07:14.072 --> 07:16.626
Don't be fooled Sam,
they're looking into all of us.

07:16.626 --> 07:18.663
As far as the Commission's
concerned, there's no difference

07:18.663 --> 07:20.112
between the cop that
puts out their hand,

07:20.112 --> 07:21.562
and the person that
greases it. Okay?

07:21.562 --> 07:23.599
They're after all of us,
we're all in a firing line,

07:23.599 --> 07:25.463
and now they're
offering amnesty.

07:25.463 --> 07:26.809
The person
with the most to lose

07:26.809 --> 07:28.397
is the person
with the most to say.

07:28.397 --> 07:30.191
They can't pin you
for being successful.

07:30.191 --> 07:31.400
They can do whatever
the hell they want.

07:31.400 --> 07:32.953
They're the
Royal fucking Commission.

07:32.953 --> 07:34.299
Relax. You're protected.

07:34.299 --> 07:36.991
Anything heavy you ever needed
doing, I did it remember.

07:37.509 --> 07:39.062
Not everything.

07:41.168 --> 07:43.964
The point is, you might
have to do some time,

07:43.964 --> 07:45.241
if it comes to it.

07:45.241 --> 07:46.760
What? You want to send
me back to fucking jail?

07:46.760 --> 07:48.693
Well, were you planning
on talking?

07:48.693 --> 07:50.626
You really have to ask?

07:52.006 --> 07:54.561
Hey, got a minute?

08:01.222 --> 08:02.258
Do I have a choice?

08:02.396 --> 08:05.882
Look, you're a smart guy,
John, I'll give you that.

08:05.882 --> 08:08.091
But there are people nowhere
near as clever as you,

08:08.091 --> 08:09.576
already running for cover.

08:09.576 --> 08:11.025
You know that, right?

08:11.509 --> 08:13.234
I'm not running anywhere.

08:13.234 --> 08:15.444
People only run
from things they fear.

08:15.961 --> 08:18.654
Okay. Profound.
It's really profound.

08:18.654 --> 08:19.758
Let me guess.

08:19.758 --> 08:21.657
Sun Tzu, 'The Art of War'?

08:21.657 --> 08:23.141
No, I think it was
a fortune cookie.

08:23.141 --> 08:25.350
- Golden Century.
- Right.

08:26.558 --> 08:28.491
Are you coming onto me?

08:35.360 --> 08:38.501
- Night, Doyle.
- Night, John.

09:24.305 --> 09:25.652
So what do you reckon?

09:26.584 --> 09:29.794
You got the Ibrahims,
Joey Romano.

09:31.002 --> 09:32.521
What about the Bui Doi?

09:32.521 --> 09:33.763
Hey, you reckon they
should be up there?

09:33.763 --> 09:37.146
How the fuck should I know.
It's nothing to do with me.

09:37.146 --> 09:39.286
Oh, is that right?

09:42.565 --> 09:43.842
It's the Bui Doi headquarters,

09:43.842 --> 09:45.361
that was robbed
a little while back.

09:46.466 --> 09:48.226
Does the bloke on the left
look familiar?

09:48.226 --> 09:49.399
Hmm?

09:49.399 --> 09:51.954
Well they're both wearing
fucking Balaclavas.

09:52.989 --> 09:55.060
You two are supposed to be
the crack team, are ya?

09:55.060 --> 09:56.545
Fucking pull my dick.

09:56.924 --> 09:58.478
Oh, there's more mate.

10:02.930 --> 10:06.416
Same Fairlane, was later seen
red-lining it out of Cabramatta

10:06.416 --> 10:08.073
after Anh Tien
was gunned down.

10:08.073 --> 10:09.316
Did you pull the plates?

10:13.803 --> 10:16.668
Shit. They were stolen,
weren't they?

10:18.774 --> 10:20.430
Oh fuck.
That's a bugger.

10:20.845 --> 10:22.985
That is a bugger. Because
it would've been too easy.

10:24.055 --> 10:27.852
Just would've been, too, easy.

10:28.818 --> 10:32.615
Anyway, if you've got nothing
else, I might piss off. Yeah?

10:32.615 --> 10:34.410
All right.
Fair enough.

10:34.410 --> 10:35.860
I mean, we better get
a wriggle on anyway,

10:35.860 --> 10:37.620
if we want to make
that meeting with Tien.

10:37.620 --> 10:39.622
Figured we'd share
all this with her lot.

10:39.622 --> 10:42.073
Maybe give it to your pals
at the Black Flag as well.

10:43.523 --> 10:45.663
Oi, oi, pull up.
Pull up.

10:45.663 --> 10:47.181
You can't fucking do that.

10:47.181 --> 10:49.598
You know those slopeheads
are fucking crazy.

10:49.598 --> 10:52.255
Those cunts will shoot first
and ask questions later.

10:52.255 --> 10:53.774
Do you think I care?

10:54.775 --> 10:57.019
All I'm interested in,
is this bloke.

10:57.019 --> 10:59.090
Did he tell you to
rob the Bui Doi?

10:59.090 --> 11:00.712
Did he order the shooting?

11:00.712 --> 11:02.956
Look, even if I
wanted to help you.

11:02.956 --> 11:04.164
Huh?

11:04.302 --> 11:06.235
You got the wrong bloke.
I've got nothing on John.

11:08.755 --> 11:09.928
Lunch in Cabramatta it is.

11:10.860 --> 11:12.897
All right.
Okay. Hey, hey!

11:13.518 --> 11:15.934
Fuck!
Just listen.

11:15.934 --> 11:17.936
Yep. I want to help you.

11:17.936 --> 11:22.354
I really do, but I, I just
don't hang out in his circle.

11:22.734 --> 11:24.080
That's it.

11:28.291 --> 11:30.570
Then find me
somebody who does.

11:42.892 --> 11:45.654
The epicentre of
police corruption in the state.

11:45.654 --> 11:48.242
Council assisting
Nigel Bolt has hinted

11:48.242 --> 11:50.348
at bombshell allegations
later this week.

11:54.352 --> 11:55.905
The fuck do you want?

11:56.837 --> 11:59.115
They made us for
the Bui Doi job.

11:59.115 --> 12:00.185
What?

12:00.185 --> 12:01.808
How? We had balaclavas on?

12:01.808 --> 12:03.637
Yeah, I don't know.
They got CCTV and shit.

12:03.637 --> 12:04.604
I don't know.

12:04.604 --> 12:07.296
What's it fucking matter,
they got us.

12:08.159 --> 12:09.678
But it's going to be sweet.

12:09.678 --> 12:10.782
No, it's not.

12:10.782 --> 12:12.266
If John finds out,
he's going to kill me.

12:12.266 --> 12:13.785
I know, that's what I'm trying
to fucking say to you.

12:13.785 --> 12:15.062
All right?

12:16.754 --> 12:18.894
They're saying there
could be a deal done.

12:19.204 --> 12:20.481
Make everything go away.

12:20.481 --> 12:23.312
What sort of deal,
I fucking shot a bloke.

12:25.279 --> 12:27.247
No fucking way.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.249
Are you out of your
fucking mind?

12:29.249 --> 12:31.527
I'm trying to stay
out of fucking Long Bay,

12:31.527 --> 12:34.150
on a 25 year stretch.
Yeah?

12:34.150 --> 12:35.496
Long Bay's the least of
your worries, mate.

12:35.496 --> 12:37.222
- You're talking about John.
- Yeah, I know.

12:37.222 --> 12:38.223
John Ibrahim, my family.

12:38.223 --> 12:40.329
I fucking know that!

12:51.167 --> 12:53.653
I'm not saying
that we do it.

12:54.723 --> 12:58.105
I'm just asking you
to think about it. Hmm?

12:58.761 --> 13:01.074
You don't look like you
are holding up too good.

13:02.040 --> 13:04.387
So you think about it.

13:09.116 --> 13:10.980
Fuck!

13:28.411 --> 13:30.137
Got the sniffles,
do you mate?

13:30.793 --> 13:32.381
Let's go.

13:49.778 --> 13:50.813
Look, I woke up sweating

13:50.813 --> 13:52.263
like a blind lesbian
in a fish market,

13:52.263 --> 13:53.367
thinking about all
the conversations

13:53.367 --> 13:54.575
I've had with blokes

13:54.575 --> 13:56.301
that could have been
wearing a wire.

13:56.301 --> 13:57.302
You ever think about that?

13:57.302 --> 13:58.303
No.

13:58.303 --> 13:59.063
Well you should, brother.

13:59.339 --> 14:00.478
It's about to give you
fucking nightmares.

14:00.478 --> 14:02.342
This why I don't do it, mate.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.033
Come on. John, you see
what I'm saying here?

14:04.033 --> 14:06.173
Like I could be recording
this entire conversation,

14:06.173 --> 14:07.036
and you wouldn't
even know it.

14:07.036 --> 14:08.244
Are you?

14:08.244 --> 14:09.659
The fuck? Of course not.
Why would you say that?

14:09.659 --> 14:10.730
Because you asked.

14:10.730 --> 14:12.386
Sorry, I'm late.
That traffic's shit.

14:12.386 --> 14:14.009
Hey. Hey.

14:15.493 --> 14:18.323
- You okay?
- Ah, no, I'm fine.

14:18.323 --> 14:20.394
I just got to take a slash.
I'll be right back.

14:58.812 --> 15:00.124
The hell do they want?

15:01.919 --> 15:03.265
Shall we put out a call?

15:03.541 --> 15:05.336
No, give her a sec.

15:05.923 --> 15:08.097
- We need to talk.
- What's that?

15:08.097 --> 15:09.719
You're going to have
to come a bit closer,

15:09.719 --> 15:11.514
if you want a
good recording.

15:14.759 --> 15:17.451
There was a robbery
at my warehouse.

15:17.831 --> 15:19.281
Two men killed my employee

15:19.281 --> 15:21.731
and tried to steal my cash
and narcotics.

15:22.111 --> 15:23.872
You're wasting your time.

15:23.872 --> 15:25.321
I got nothing to do
with drugs.

15:25.321 --> 15:26.495
It's not about that.

15:26.495 --> 15:29.567
Last week, one of the same
men murdered my brother.

15:30.119 --> 15:31.569
I'm sorry to hear that,

15:31.569 --> 15:35.366
but as I recall, you tried
to do the same thing to mine.

15:35.366 --> 15:37.851
Your brother
is in the business.

15:37.851 --> 15:39.853
Mine was in a wheelchair.

15:40.958 --> 15:42.166
I need a name, John.

15:42.166 --> 15:44.858
You really don't know me.
I don't give up my friends.

15:44.858 --> 15:46.515
I assume your
friends told you

15:46.515 --> 15:48.931
about the contract on
your brother's life.

15:52.279 --> 15:53.798
I didn't think so.

16:03.118 --> 16:05.672
- Hey, have you got a sec?
- Yeah.

16:05.914 --> 16:09.055
Mate, um, I, I just
wanted to let you know

16:09.055 --> 16:12.403
that the cops from the Royal
Commission pulled me in today.

16:12.403 --> 16:14.094
Yeah, I was dropping in
on Ashtray Frank.

16:14.094 --> 16:15.406
I saw them put
you in the car.

16:16.786 --> 16:18.236
Well...

16:19.479 --> 16:20.445
Why didn't you say something?

16:20.445 --> 16:22.447
I could ask you
the same thing.

16:22.447 --> 16:24.035
Well I'm telling
you now, aren't I?

16:25.036 --> 16:26.279
What?

16:28.660 --> 16:30.214
You're testing me?

16:30.214 --> 16:31.767
What? You don't bring it up to
see if I'll bring it up.

16:31.767 --> 16:32.837
Is that it?

16:32.837 --> 16:33.803
Put yourself in
my shoes, Dave.

16:33.803 --> 16:35.253
Oh, I grew up
in your shoes, mate.

16:35.253 --> 16:37.014
You really think I'd
dog you to the cops?

16:37.014 --> 16:38.912
Plenty of other
people have.

16:40.051 --> 16:41.673
Fuck.

16:44.884 --> 16:46.161
Good to know.

16:49.164 --> 16:50.751
You know, you ever
wonder why you live

16:50.751 --> 16:52.443
in that big ass house
all by yourself?

16:52.443 --> 16:53.996
Spit it out!

16:55.135 --> 16:56.309
Huh?

16:56.654 --> 16:57.586
Be a big fucking boy,

16:57.586 --> 16:59.381
and tell me for once
in your fucking life.

16:59.795 --> 17:03.903
Huh? You so much better? For
once in your fucking life. Huh?

17:05.387 --> 17:07.389
Why don't you fucking
say something?

17:07.389 --> 17:08.873
Come on.
Come on.

17:09.770 --> 17:11.911
Hey, Dave, Dave, Dave!

17:13.740 --> 17:16.950
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey breath.

17:18.193 --> 17:20.954
Fuck! I'm sorry.
Hey, I'm sorry.

17:22.956 --> 17:26.028
Hey, come on.
Dave, I'm sorry.

17:26.028 --> 17:28.134
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. It's okay.

17:28.134 --> 17:29.480
It's okay.

17:30.170 --> 17:32.552
Breathe. Breathe.

17:33.104 --> 17:35.796
You're okay.

17:36.280 --> 17:37.902
Fucking help me!

17:42.079 --> 17:44.667
JT! Call a doctor.
Sorry about this guys.

17:51.398 --> 17:52.399
Oi!

17:55.161 --> 17:56.817
This going to be all right?

17:56.817 --> 17:58.888
Well, you're lucky
it's not worse.

17:58.888 --> 17:59.786
When you mix and match

17:59.786 --> 18:01.581
prescription meds
and street drugs,

18:01.581 --> 18:03.203
and... well, you crazy.

18:03.203 --> 18:04.308
What are you talking about?

18:04.308 --> 18:06.310
It's the track marks
on his arm, mate.

18:08.519 --> 18:12.040
And I found this,
in his pocket.

18:12.040 --> 18:13.869
It's anti-anxiety meds.

18:14.594 --> 18:16.354
Did you know he was
doing any of this shit?

18:20.910 --> 18:22.809
I'm his mate,
I'm not his mum.

18:23.430 --> 18:24.535
He's a big boy.

18:24.535 --> 18:25.708
Listen up Johnny.

18:25.881 --> 18:29.229
Some guys thrive in this sort
of environment and some don't.

18:29.229 --> 18:30.437
Okay?

18:30.437 --> 18:31.680
Dave's not shooting up heroin

18:31.680 --> 18:33.785
and popping uppers and downers
because he's thriving.

18:33.785 --> 18:36.926
And you guys, you're not
his mates if you let him.

19:00.157 --> 19:01.192
Mr Mansour,

19:01.365 --> 19:04.230
can you explain exactly
what you mean by 'the laugh'?

19:04.230 --> 19:06.473
'The laugh' is the money
that gets kicked up

19:06.473 --> 19:08.648
to the cops to make sure
they turn a blind eye.

19:08.648 --> 19:09.614
A blind eye to what?

19:09.614 --> 19:11.030
Depends how big
'the laugh' is.

19:11.030 --> 19:13.308
I see. So it's protection
money, in other words.

19:13.308 --> 19:14.895
Something like that.

19:14.895 --> 19:16.552
And could anyone
assume the role

19:16.552 --> 19:18.451
of collecting and distributing
this protection money?

19:18.451 --> 19:20.418
Sure... if they didn't
value their knee-caps.

19:20.418 --> 19:21.350
Why do you say that?

19:21.350 --> 19:22.972
Because collecting
protection money is

19:22.972 --> 19:25.389
like owning your
own personal ATM.

19:25.389 --> 19:26.804
Talking big bickies.

19:26.804 --> 19:29.289
And who runs the protection
racket in Kings Cross

19:29.289 --> 19:30.428
right now?

19:32.844 --> 19:35.226
Mr Mansour,
the Commission can't help you

19:35.226 --> 19:36.434
if you don't help
the Commission.

19:36.434 --> 19:38.057
It used to be Sam who
collector for Nasa,

19:38.057 --> 19:38.954
and now it's John.

19:38.954 --> 19:39.782
John...

19:39.782 --> 19:41.439
...as in John Ibrahim?

19:41.991 --> 19:43.786
And who does
John collect for?

19:44.684 --> 19:46.513
John collects for John.

19:50.345 --> 19:55.004
And does that make John
Ibrahim, the Mr Big of Kings
Cross?

19:55.004 --> 19:56.213
Nobody talks like that.

19:57.352 --> 20:00.320
But if he's not,
I don't know who is.

20:01.942 --> 20:04.497
One name that
got particular mention was

20:04.497 --> 20:07.051
nightclub impresario
John Ibrahim.

20:07.051 --> 20:09.191
Unfamiliar to most until now,

20:09.191 --> 20:11.849
It's unlikely this will be
the last time Mr Ibrahim

20:11.849 --> 20:14.817
will be mentioned during
the course of the inquest.

20:18.235 --> 20:21.238
Mansour's a street dealer
who lies for a living.

20:21.238 --> 20:22.860
The Commission won't
give any serious weight

20:22.860 --> 20:24.103
to what he's saying.

20:25.794 --> 20:27.209
Have you talked to Crellan?

20:27.209 --> 20:29.591
Bryan's old school, mate.

20:29.591 --> 20:31.317
He, he'll look after
himself on the stand.

20:31.317 --> 20:33.112
But I'd rather
he didn't have to.

20:33.112 --> 20:34.906
Why? I can't exactly stop him

20:34.906 --> 20:36.563
from speaking to the Commission.

20:37.495 --> 20:38.910
Why not?

20:52.407 --> 20:54.547
It's beautiful, isn't it?

20:55.927 --> 20:58.999
You know, when I first
moved in here, right.

21:00.311 --> 21:02.865
They said you
couldn't build out,

21:02.865 --> 21:04.453
you couldn't expand,
you know?

21:04.453 --> 21:07.629
So Tony had a word with the,
with the neighbours.

21:07.629 --> 21:09.872
Yeah. No, my suggestion
was that he buys 'em out.

21:09.872 --> 21:10.701
Yeah.

21:10.701 --> 21:12.323
So, one of the neighbours,

21:12.323 --> 21:13.911
he was happy to take
the money and run,

21:13.911 --> 21:15.809
but the other fella,
like he'd raised his kids

21:15.809 --> 21:17.915
in the joint and he wouldn't
sell, no matter fucking what.

21:18.467 --> 21:21.194
You know. So it's, I think it
was the sentimental value.

21:21.194 --> 21:22.091
I don't know.

21:22.540 --> 21:24.818
Anyway, the funny thing was,
he comes home from work one day

21:24.818 --> 21:27.200
to check his mail, only to find
an eastern brown snake

21:27.200 --> 21:29.168
somehow went up in his
fucking letter box.

21:30.410 --> 21:31.239
Fuck.

21:32.412 --> 21:34.759
Now, I dunno if you know
anything about reptiles

21:34.759 --> 21:37.106
but the eastern brown
snake is super aggressive.

21:37.106 --> 21:40.040
So it has a real
fucking go at him, right.

21:40.040 --> 21:41.249
That poor bugger.

21:41.249 --> 21:43.699
He ended up selling up
from his hospital bed,

21:43.699 --> 21:44.873
he was that rattled.

21:45.253 --> 21:46.357
I know, it's amazing.

21:46.357 --> 21:48.152
I mean, but everyone
has their price, right?

21:49.843 --> 21:53.157
Osmon! You can put this
fucker in his car.

21:55.159 --> 21:56.609
Cheers, mate.

21:58.127 --> 21:59.405
You keep us posted.
All right.

22:00.440 --> 22:01.717
Of course.

22:02.580 --> 22:04.341
What a fucking paperweight.

22:04.341 --> 22:05.238
I know.

22:05.238 --> 22:06.688
So what do you think?

22:06.688 --> 22:07.620
It's hard to say.

22:07.723 --> 22:08.793
I think he's probably
right about Crellan.

22:08.931 --> 22:10.864
I think he's the sort of
guy who's going to, you know,

22:10.864 --> 22:11.900
not turn up without a fight.

22:11.900 --> 22:13.246
Yeah.

22:14.213 --> 22:16.042
- Oh it's a bit chilly.
- Yeah.

22:16.042 --> 22:17.733
Hello sweetheart.

22:20.080 --> 22:21.772
So what about John?

22:22.807 --> 22:27.156
Same. Loyalty's a big
deal for John.

22:27.156 --> 22:28.227
More than most.

22:28.365 --> 22:31.264
You know what? I wish I'd
never met either of them.

22:33.715 --> 22:35.855
Leave it with me
and I'll tidy it up.

22:58.153 --> 23:00.673
- Yeah.
- We got to meet.

23:02.088 --> 23:03.054
Today?

23:03.054 --> 23:06.195
Now.
This is not negotiable.

23:06.195 --> 23:07.680
Righto.

23:28.770 --> 23:31.117
If you're not back
in five, I'll call Sam.

23:31.117 --> 23:33.361
If I'm not back in
five, you call the morgue.

23:49.377 --> 23:50.447
Here he is.

23:52.241 --> 23:53.277
What's going on?

23:54.382 --> 23:56.349
Nothing, mate,
just want to have a chat.

23:57.316 --> 23:59.870
Not over the phone?

23:59.870 --> 24:02.976
Well, it's not that
kind of a chat, Johnny.

24:02.976 --> 24:04.150
Not these days, anyway.

24:07.567 --> 24:08.913
Look at this.

24:08.913 --> 24:11.882
That is the most recognisable
sign in the Cross.

24:13.228 --> 24:14.712
Probably.

24:14.712 --> 24:16.645
Not fucking probably, mate,
100 percent.

24:16.645 --> 24:18.544
You know, years ago,

24:18.544 --> 24:21.581
Ezra, he took me up here
and he told me,

24:21.581 --> 24:22.893
doesn't matter what
happens down there,

24:22.893 --> 24:26.275
with all the bits and
pieces, the little shit.

24:26.724 --> 24:28.243
He said,

24:30.003 --> 24:31.626
"If you want to be
King of the Cross,

24:33.524 --> 24:35.008
you have to own it".

24:35.975 --> 24:37.425
And he fucking owns it.

24:38.495 --> 24:40.807
Johnny, he's not going
to give it up in a hurry.

24:41.670 --> 24:42.671
You don't have
to worry about me,

24:42.671 --> 24:44.570
I'm happy with
my little patch.

24:46.295 --> 24:48.781
You know, big brother's
fronting the Commission today.

24:48.781 --> 24:51.197
Should be interesting.

24:52.992 --> 24:54.545
Always is with Sam.

24:55.857 --> 24:57.306
Then you're up Friday, yeah?

24:58.653 --> 25:00.793
You thought about what
you're going to say?

25:01.966 --> 25:03.382
Going to say nothing.

25:06.488 --> 25:08.697
And what about that thing
we did with old mate?

25:08.697 --> 25:10.768
I don't know what
you're talking about.

25:11.976 --> 25:13.840
That's a good answer.

25:13.840 --> 25:17.672
Tony, tell your boss he
doesn't have to worry.

25:18.673 --> 25:19.915
Not about me.

25:20.709 --> 25:23.367
Well, I hope you're
right, son. I really do.

25:24.368 --> 25:26.474
For both our sakes,
you understand?

25:27.923 --> 25:29.753
Yeah.

25:48.116 --> 25:48.979
What?

25:58.229 --> 25:59.645
They pulled Keith in.

26:01.232 --> 26:02.958
They going to pull
everyone in at some point,

26:02.958 --> 26:04.201
doesn't mean shit.

26:04.201 --> 26:06.306
It's fucking Keith, mate,
he's as thick as two bricks,

26:06.306 --> 26:07.618
you know what
he's fucking like!

26:07.618 --> 26:09.448
Once they've got what they've
got, then that's fucking it!

26:09.448 --> 26:10.759
Mate, calm down.

26:10.759 --> 26:13.693
Listen, even if they
get the old mutt to heel,

26:13.693 --> 26:16.006
there's no way they're going to
get the big dogs to roll over.

26:16.006 --> 26:16.903
But that's just it.

26:17.110 --> 26:18.905
Like you said, they don't
fucking need us all,

26:18.905 --> 26:20.286
they just need fucking one.

26:20.286 --> 26:23.669
And by which point, it'll
be our word against theirs,

26:23.669 --> 26:26.465
which means no one's
going anywhere.

26:26.879 --> 26:28.846
We just got to hold the line.

26:31.918 --> 26:34.473
Moons, do you trust me?

26:35.128 --> 26:36.233
Of course
I fucking trust you.

26:36.233 --> 26:37.959
Good. Well it's simple then.

26:37.959 --> 26:41.618
You go home, put on
a fucking Enya CD,

26:41.618 --> 26:43.516
pour Kath a big glass
of Chardonnay

26:43.516 --> 26:45.311
and give her one from me.

26:45.725 --> 26:47.762
Because if you don't,
I fucking will.

26:47.762 --> 26:49.073
You know I've
fancied her for ages.

26:49.073 --> 26:51.075
You give me a window,
I'm going to take it.

26:54.907 --> 26:56.598
They can never break us, mate.

26:57.426 --> 26:59.014
All right?

26:59.014 --> 27:02.086
Now get in.

27:11.164 --> 27:13.132
This fucking prick.

27:13.546 --> 27:16.135
Goes away a crim, comes back
a fucking catwalk model.

27:20.139 --> 27:22.659
- Good to see you, brother.
- Yeah.

27:22.659 --> 27:24.868
Hey, three of the usual, please.

27:26.939 --> 27:27.974
How you doin'?

27:29.044 --> 27:30.529
Yeah, I'm all right.

27:30.529 --> 27:33.221
All right. You look good.
Fucking big.

27:34.740 --> 27:37.466
Those Commission lawyers won't
know what the fuck hit 'em.

27:39.745 --> 27:41.298
This is Rhino.

27:41.298 --> 27:43.403
He's been keeping the dealers
in check since you went in.

27:45.509 --> 27:48.477
Can't have those cunts
running themselves, can we?

27:48.477 --> 27:49.789
Nah, no.

27:51.480 --> 27:53.344
Hey Rico, can you grab
me another one of these?

27:53.344 --> 27:54.207
Oi, oi.

27:54.553 --> 27:55.381
But make sure they put a bit
of extra froth in there.

27:55.381 --> 27:56.244
Hey.

27:56.244 --> 27:57.521
I like to eat it
with my spoon.

27:57.521 --> 27:59.005
Sammy.

27:59.005 --> 28:01.007
What?
Come on.

28:01.007 --> 28:02.630
- Don't be a fucking prick.
- Come on, chop chop!

28:02.630 --> 28:03.769
- Sammy!
- What?

28:03.769 --> 28:04.804
Listen.

28:04.804 --> 28:07.082
Things have calmed down
since he took over.

28:07.082 --> 28:07.911
So?

28:08.187 --> 28:09.740
So, with all this Commission
bullshit going on,

28:09.740 --> 28:11.121
there's no point rocking
the boat, is there?

28:11.121 --> 28:12.605
Who's rocking the boat?

28:12.605 --> 28:14.918
Am I rocking the boat? Rico?

28:14.918 --> 28:16.126
Stop fucking around.

28:17.230 --> 28:19.508
The job needed filling,
I fucking filled it.

28:21.856 --> 28:23.547
You want me to spell
it out for you?

28:25.860 --> 28:28.379
Right. Well you've
been replaced.

28:39.114 --> 28:40.806
By who, this bloke?

28:41.772 --> 28:42.601
Yeah.

28:47.467 --> 28:48.986
Oh!

28:51.092 --> 28:51.920
Fuck!

28:55.027 --> 28:56.822
Fuck, I missed you Joey.

28:57.374 --> 28:59.583
So good to see you again.

29:01.654 --> 29:03.207
Stay in the car.
Won't be long.

29:09.282 --> 29:10.939
So are you
feeling any better?

29:10.939 --> 29:12.078
Good as gold, bro.

29:12.078 --> 29:13.252
I'm stinging to
get back into it.

29:13.252 --> 29:16.013
All right, well just,
you know. Take it easy.

29:16.393 --> 29:18.498
You had a fit.
It was serious.

29:18.498 --> 29:19.361
Come on.

29:19.638 --> 29:21.778
Look, I'm back training
and I'm eating healthy.

29:21.778 --> 29:23.193
I'm good to go.

29:24.401 --> 29:25.644
What about the meds?

29:28.854 --> 29:30.269
What do you want me to say?

29:33.030 --> 29:35.792
I was feeling a pinch,
and I thought that'd help.

29:35.792 --> 29:37.103
It was a one-off.

29:40.451 --> 29:41.867
The other stuff?

29:43.247 --> 29:44.145
What?

29:46.147 --> 29:48.597
You never done something you
wish you could take back?

29:51.152 --> 29:54.396
Hey! Look who I
found snooping around.

29:54.396 --> 29:55.743
I thought I said
wait in the car.

29:55.743 --> 29:57.503
I thought you said
you won't be long.

29:57.503 --> 29:59.919
And the smell of the cake's
so good, I can't help myself.

29:59.919 --> 30:02.335
Don't be silly,
you're always welcome.

30:02.335 --> 30:04.061
Now, eat up!

30:04.579 --> 30:07.513
I still see you do your
jigsaw puzzle, eh?

30:07.513 --> 30:09.584
Ah, it's cheaper
than going there.

30:09.584 --> 30:10.550
Eh, it's true.

30:10.689 --> 30:12.518
I'm a bit
stuck on this one, though.

30:12.518 --> 30:14.382
Here,
let me help you.

30:15.348 --> 30:17.281
And how's the
restaurant going?

30:17.281 --> 30:19.698
- Yeah, it's good, isn't it?
- Yeah.

30:19.698 --> 30:21.216
Dave and I are going to
open a new restaurant

30:21.216 --> 30:22.908
once he's back on his feet.

30:22.908 --> 30:26.635
You're a good team, you two.
Always were.

30:27.706 --> 30:28.948
Oh.

30:29.535 --> 30:32.089
Oh no, don't show them
that Mrs C, please don't.

30:35.990 --> 30:37.163
There it is,
there's the perm.

30:37.163 --> 30:39.165
- Shut up, JT.
- Oh my goodness.

30:39.165 --> 30:40.477
- You got no hair.
- Look at you two.

30:40.477 --> 30:41.305
Go do your puzzles.

30:42.444 --> 30:44.239
Have you got
a puzzle for this one?

30:44.239 --> 30:45.585
Take it easy.

30:47.277 --> 30:48.934
Thank you, Mrs C.

30:50.521 --> 30:53.593
Hey, it's good to see you.
It's always...

30:55.285 --> 30:56.631
Look after him, John.

30:57.839 --> 31:00.773
Once I'm gone,
you're all he's got.

31:03.224 --> 31:04.225
I will.

31:17.203 --> 31:19.585
You may stand
down, Mr Amante.

31:19.585 --> 31:21.552
Thought you'd never ask.

31:24.210 --> 31:27.075
Call your next
witness, Mr Bolt.

31:27.075 --> 31:30.803
Uh, calling, um,
Mr Hassan Ibrahim, please.

31:32.632 --> 31:34.220
Mr Hassan Ibrahim.

31:54.240 --> 31:55.794
Do you want to take
the oath or affirm?

31:55.794 --> 31:57.830
I'm an atheist, brother.

31:57.830 --> 31:59.349
Then repeat after me.

31:59.349 --> 32:05.251
I solemnly and sincerely
declare and affirm.

32:05.251 --> 32:06.425
That the evidence I shall give.

32:06.425 --> 32:07.667
The evidence I shall give.

32:07.667 --> 32:09.083
Will be the truth, the
whole truth,

32:09.083 --> 32:09.980
and nothing but the truth.

32:09.980 --> 32:11.602
Will be the truth,
the whole truth,

32:11.602 --> 32:12.949
and nothing but the truth.

32:24.857 --> 32:27.618
Please state your name
and age for the court.

32:27.618 --> 32:29.655
Sam Ibrahim, and not sure.

32:31.415 --> 32:32.831
Excuse me?

32:32.831 --> 32:34.729
I've never had a
birth certificate.

32:36.282 --> 32:40.114
I see, and what is your
occupation?

32:40.114 --> 32:42.185
This and that, you know.

32:42.185 --> 32:44.463
Well, actually, I don't know,
Mr Ibrahim.

32:44.463 --> 32:46.223
What is it that you
do for a living?

32:46.223 --> 32:47.811
I do my best.

32:48.950 --> 32:50.503
I see.

32:51.056 --> 32:52.195
Can you elaborate?

33:03.654 --> 33:06.036
I rob and stand
over drug dealers.

33:07.935 --> 33:09.695
Silence,
please. Thank you.

33:09.695 --> 33:12.387
Thank you. Silence. Thank you.

33:22.087 --> 33:23.157
Ah!

33:23.157 --> 33:24.606
There he is.

33:24.606 --> 33:25.953
I was starting to wonder
whether the Bui Doi

33:25.953 --> 33:27.402
had caught up with ya.

33:28.610 --> 33:29.646
You'd like that,
wouldn't you?

33:29.646 --> 33:31.959
Well, neither here nor
there to tell the truth.

33:31.959 --> 33:34.030
You're screwed either way.

33:34.030 --> 33:36.273
We pulled CCTV footage
on the day

33:36.273 --> 33:38.482
of Anh Tien's murder
from all the servos

33:38.482 --> 33:41.278
from Cabramatta
to the Cross.

33:42.072 --> 33:44.212
Same plates as
the Bui Doi job.

33:44.212 --> 33:45.041
Whoops.

33:48.285 --> 33:49.528
Hang on, we have a deal.

33:49.528 --> 33:50.874
Yeah, we had a deal, fuckhead.

33:50.874 --> 33:52.738
But you didn't come through
with it, so the deal's off.

33:52.738 --> 33:55.051
Bullshit! I've got a guy,
all right?

33:55.051 --> 33:56.190
- Ah, it's too late.
- No, no, no, no.

33:56.190 --> 33:57.916
I'm tellin' ya,
this is the guy.

33:57.916 --> 33:59.296
He's like this with John,

33:59.296 --> 34:01.298
he's this close to coming
around, 100 percent.

34:01.298 --> 34:02.230
Well he'd want to be.

34:02.575 --> 34:04.129
Otherwise, this time tomorrow
I'm going to introduce you

34:04.129 --> 34:05.544
to my mate down at homicide.

34:18.281 --> 34:19.558
I'll find a park
and be right in.

34:22.147 --> 34:22.975
Feeling okay?

34:22.975 --> 34:25.426
Jeez, when'd you
become such a narc?

34:25.426 --> 34:27.428
Stop breaking my balls.

34:34.159 --> 34:35.574
Go on, get out. Move.

34:44.514 --> 34:45.308
What?

34:45.411 --> 34:46.171
We need to talk.

34:46.274 --> 34:48.242
I can't,
I'm at fucking work, mate.

34:48.242 --> 34:50.175
Look, we're fucked!
We need to talk, now.

34:52.039 --> 34:54.386
Fine. Fine.

34:55.559 --> 34:56.802
Fuck!

35:06.122 --> 35:08.262
Fuck!
Fuck!

35:08.262 --> 35:10.436
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

35:12.300 --> 35:13.405
Shut the fuck up!

35:32.631 --> 35:35.151
They got me for
the Cabra shooting.

35:35.151 --> 35:36.807
They what?

35:36.807 --> 35:39.845
They're chasing you as an
accomplice or some shit.

35:39.845 --> 35:41.260
What the fuck?

35:41.260 --> 35:42.227
It had nothing
to do with me.

35:42.227 --> 35:43.435
I didn't even know
it was happening,

35:43.435 --> 35:44.263
did you tell them that?

35:44.401 --> 35:47.197
They reckon it's linked
to the robbery

35:47.197 --> 35:48.612
so you're part of it.

35:56.793 --> 35:58.864
It's fork in the road
time now, mate.

36:00.141 --> 36:01.384
You either come
clean to John...

36:01.384 --> 36:02.868
Come clean to John?

36:02.868 --> 36:04.421
They tried to end Sam
as payback,

36:04.421 --> 36:05.629
are you fucking
kidding me?

36:05.629 --> 36:07.079
You don't have to
fucking tell me this!

36:07.079 --> 36:08.908
All right, you think I
don't already know this?

36:08.908 --> 36:11.083
This whole situation
sucks dicks!

36:11.083 --> 36:12.843
But this is where we are.

36:13.603 --> 36:14.914
And I'll bet ya,

36:16.123 --> 36:19.333
if John was in your shoes,
he'd do the same thing.

36:19.333 --> 36:21.404
He'd look after number one.

36:21.404 --> 36:24.338
We ought to tell the
jacks he told us to do it.

36:24.338 --> 36:27.444
Hm? That's what
they want to hear.

36:51.365 --> 36:52.676
We don't have to be here,
you know.

36:52.676 --> 36:53.574
Ah, we do.

36:53.574 --> 36:55.127
Right now, the Cross
is trying to see

36:55.127 --> 36:57.681
who's on the way out,
and who's still got juice.

36:58.199 --> 37:00.926
Now maybe I come here with a
beautiful girl, have a drink.

37:00.926 --> 37:03.031
Maybe they don't
know the difference.

37:06.345 --> 37:08.209
Brought your favourite.

37:08.485 --> 37:09.417
Thank you.

37:11.626 --> 37:13.663
Ah.

37:16.838 --> 37:18.599
Never picked you
for a reader.

37:18.599 --> 37:20.877
Yeah. I can read
my name and all.

37:37.031 --> 37:39.137
Take it. It's fine.

37:43.175 --> 37:44.659
What is it? I'm busy.

37:44.659 --> 37:45.488
We've got to talk.

37:45.695 --> 37:46.592
I told you I've got
nothing to say to you,

37:46.592 --> 37:47.697
especially not
on the phone.

37:47.697 --> 37:49.802
Right, so let's meet.
I'm at the Granville.

37:49.802 --> 37:52.080
Are you deaf? I said I'm busy.

37:52.080 --> 37:55.601
Fuck busy! We've got
to sort this out.

37:55.601 --> 37:57.534
It's about your brother.

37:57.534 --> 37:59.018
Thirty minutes.

38:01.952 --> 38:03.091
I'll get Dave to drive.

38:05.232 --> 38:07.510
- Sorry.
- It's fine.

38:07.510 --> 38:09.305
You'll be all right
here with these dickheads?

38:09.305 --> 38:11.341
At least this way
I get to dance.

38:12.204 --> 38:14.172
- Right?
- Yeah, no problem.

38:15.690 --> 38:17.175
All right.

38:28.289 --> 38:29.325
Why are we going to him, anyway?

38:30.636 --> 38:32.638
Little prick should be coming
to us if he wants a powwow.

38:32.638 --> 38:34.053
The Cross is one big
microphone right now.

38:34.053 --> 38:35.227
Whatever Joey's
got to say, I don't want

38:35.227 --> 38:36.539
some other cock listening.

38:40.405 --> 38:41.958
What? I'm not going
in there unarmed.

38:41.958 --> 38:44.788
You're not going in there
at all. Put that shit away.

38:45.375 --> 38:47.895
He might be a wanker,
but he's still Joey.

38:48.309 --> 38:50.449
Just stay here.
Won't be long.

38:54.764 --> 38:56.593
That being said, if I
stand up without leaving,

38:56.593 --> 38:59.147
you come in and you do
not be shy about it.

38:59.147 --> 39:02.047
Okay?

39:12.471 --> 39:14.197
I didn't want it,
I didn't ask for it.

39:14.197 --> 39:16.337
You were the one who was
always getting me fucked.

39:17.994 --> 39:19.616
Welcome.

39:19.616 --> 39:21.100
Help yourself, eh?

39:21.929 --> 39:23.068
Oh.

39:23.793 --> 39:25.001
Excuse me.

39:28.211 --> 39:29.868
What do you want?

39:29.868 --> 39:32.526
Come on, mate, you know
exactly what I want.

39:32.526 --> 39:34.252
We've got to sort
this bullshit out,

39:34.252 --> 39:36.668
or the whole fucking
thing's going to explode.

39:36.668 --> 39:37.876
I don't know what
you're talking about.

39:37.876 --> 39:40.258
I'm talking about
your brother.

39:40.258 --> 39:41.328
The fuck do you think
I'm talking about?

39:41.500 --> 39:43.088
Hey, you got a problem with
Sam, take it up with him.

39:43.088 --> 39:44.503
Nah, you're not listening.

39:45.711 --> 39:47.299
We've all got a
problem with Sam.

39:48.680 --> 39:50.544
Now, I love him,
don't get me wrong.

39:50.544 --> 39:53.098
But that fucking shit
he pulled at the Commission.

39:53.098 --> 39:54.686
"I rob and stand over
drug dealers",

39:54.686 --> 39:56.101
looking straight at me.

39:56.101 --> 39:58.345
The guy's a fucking liability.

39:58.345 --> 39:59.346
You know that better
than anyone.

39:59.449 --> 40:00.761
Let me stop you there
before you say something

40:00.761 --> 40:01.727
you can't walk back, Joe.

40:01.727 --> 40:03.108
John.

40:03.108 --> 40:06.629
I understand that blood is
thicker than water with you lot.

40:06.629 --> 40:09.804
But at the end of the day,
you can drown in both.

40:09.804 --> 40:11.427
Now, if you don't do
something, I will.

40:14.637 --> 40:15.638
Sit the fuck down.

40:32.551 --> 40:33.414
You even know how
to use that thing?

40:33.414 --> 40:35.451
Fuck you. Sit down.

40:36.279 --> 40:38.005
I said sit the fuck down!

40:38.971 --> 40:39.869
You think you can come in here

40:39.869 --> 40:41.629
and talk like that
to Joey, you fuck?

40:41.629 --> 40:43.321
Go on, then.
Pull the trigger.

40:43.321 --> 40:45.599
Enjoy the last ten minutes of
your miserable fucking life.

40:46.393 --> 40:47.394
Say the word, Joey.

40:49.085 --> 40:50.742
Let me end this cunt.

40:54.953 --> 40:56.264
Joey.

41:05.584 --> 41:06.413
Joey!

41:10.037 --> 41:12.246
You pulled your gun out
one too many times.

41:25.432 --> 41:26.364
You fucking moron!

41:26.364 --> 41:27.779
Do you understand what
you've just done?

41:27.779 --> 41:29.401
Pulling a gun
on John Ibrahim?

41:29.401 --> 41:30.747
Fuck you.

41:41.068 --> 41:42.656
Trust you, can I?

42:39.954 --> 42:41.335
Oh, someone thought
they'd skip out

42:41.335 --> 42:43.441
without saying goodbye,
did they?

42:52.380 --> 42:55.211
Just in case I'm not here
tonight to let you in.

42:59.387 --> 43:00.975
Don't you fucking dare.

43:09.052 --> 43:11.469
And so, with
several high profile witnesses

43:11.469 --> 43:14.644
due to give testimony,
today may well turn out to be

43:14.644 --> 43:16.750
a seminal moment
in the investigation

43:16.750 --> 43:19.062
of corruption in Kings Cross.

43:19.994 --> 43:21.409
Mr Ibrahim, do you
have any comments

43:21.409 --> 43:22.997
about what you've
seen so far?

43:27.277 --> 43:29.866
- John.
- I'm already late.

43:30.626 --> 43:31.627
Look, I fucked up, okay?

43:31.627 --> 43:32.904
Please, just listen to me,
all right...

43:32.904 --> 43:36.114
I listened to you when you said
you were a hundred percent.

43:36.114 --> 43:38.288
It almost got me killed, Dave.

43:38.288 --> 43:41.291
- Can't trust you.
- John, John, John, just wait.

43:41.913 --> 43:44.502
I'm sorry, John, I'm sorry.

43:46.711 --> 43:47.746
We're done.

43:50.853 --> 43:52.130
Go home.

43:53.580 --> 43:55.098
John.

44:03.417 --> 44:06.144
I put it to you that
you are a major player

44:06.144 --> 44:09.112
in the distribution of
drugs in Kings Cross.

44:09.457 --> 44:12.426
And I put it to you that all
coppers are cunts-tables.

44:14.255 --> 44:16.326
I put it to you, in fact,
that you are

44:16.326 --> 44:18.156
in direct competition
with John Ibrahim

44:18.156 --> 44:20.158
for control of the
Kings Cross drug market.

44:20.158 --> 44:22.367
John does what John does.

44:23.195 --> 44:25.612
Ask him, he's sitting
right there.

44:25.612 --> 44:27.683
Personally, I've never had
anything to do with drugs.

44:27.683 --> 44:28.891
I hate the stuff.

44:28.891 --> 44:30.064
Right, so you've never had

44:30.064 --> 44:32.446
any kind of dealings
with drugs whatsoever?

44:32.446 --> 44:34.448
I run a video arcade, Mr Bolt.

44:34.448 --> 44:36.484
My business is with
15-year-old kids

44:36.484 --> 44:37.865
trying to clock Galaga.

44:37.865 --> 44:41.420
I see. Well, would you
mind describing for me

44:41.420 --> 44:43.491
exactly what it is
you're doing here, then?

45:03.132 --> 45:05.099
I thought about
what you said.

45:05.099 --> 45:07.446
John would do
the same thing.

45:07.446 --> 45:08.551
Fuck him.

45:22.392 --> 45:23.393
Detective Sergeant Crellan,

45:23.393 --> 45:24.843
you've been with the
Kings Cross detectives

45:24.843 --> 45:27.605
for seven years now,
is that correct?

45:27.605 --> 45:28.778
That's correct.

45:28.778 --> 45:29.952
And in that seven years,

45:29.952 --> 45:32.679
have you ever encountered
any form of corruption?

45:32.679 --> 45:35.164
For instance, have members
of the criminal world

45:35.164 --> 45:38.546
ever tried to bribe their
way out of their troubles?

45:38.546 --> 45:41.342
Several times and that's
just this morning.

45:41.342 --> 45:42.930
Answer the question, detective.

45:42.930 --> 45:43.966
Ah sorry, which is?

45:43.966 --> 45:47.452
Have you witnessed
attempts to bribe police?

45:47.452 --> 45:49.765
Absolutely I've witnessed attempts.

45:49.765 --> 45:52.457
Desperate men
do desperate things.

45:52.457 --> 45:54.839
But I've never witnessed
a fellow officer

45:54.839 --> 45:56.357
succumb to such an attempt.

45:56.357 --> 45:57.600
To be clear, then,

45:57.600 --> 46:01.984
you have never received
money from criminals

46:01.984 --> 46:04.400
in the course
of doing your job.

46:04.400 --> 46:08.231
Absolutely not,
and my unblemished

46:08.231 --> 46:10.544
service record speaks to that.

46:10.544 --> 46:12.235
Commissioner,
I have no further questions

46:12.235 --> 46:13.892
for Detective Sergeant
Crellan, however,

46:13.892 --> 46:15.756
I would request
that he remain on hand

46:15.756 --> 46:18.517
in case I have any
follow up questions,

46:18.517 --> 46:20.485
once we've heard further testimony.

46:20.485 --> 46:21.969
Thank you, Detective Sergeant.

46:21.969 --> 46:25.041
- You're dismissed for now.
- Thank you.

46:25.973 --> 46:27.492
Commissioner,
I'd like to call

46:27.492 --> 46:29.943
Detective Declan Mooney,
if I may.

46:30.564 --> 46:32.600
Detective Declan
Mooney, please.

46:38.468 --> 46:39.746
If you could
state your name and

46:39.746 --> 46:41.851
occupation for
the court, please.

46:41.851 --> 46:46.511
Declan Paul Mooney,
Senior Detective Constable

46:46.511 --> 46:48.996
for the Kings Cross
local area command.

46:48.996 --> 46:51.136
Detective Mooney,
if you could just

46:51.136 --> 46:53.552
watch the monitor
for me, please.

46:53.794 --> 46:57.280
Have you witnessed
attempts to bribe police?

46:57.280 --> 46:59.593
Absolutely
I've witnessed attempts.

46:59.593 --> 47:02.354
Desperate men do
desperate things.

47:02.354 --> 47:04.218
But I have never witnessed
a fellow officer

47:04.218 --> 47:06.393
succumb to such an attempt.

47:06.393 --> 47:07.670
To be clear, then,

47:07.670 --> 47:11.709
you have never received
money from criminals

47:11.709 --> 47:14.125
in the course
of doing your job?

47:14.125 --> 47:17.922
Absolutely not,
and my unblemished

47:17.922 --> 47:19.889
service record speaks to that.

47:21.857 --> 47:25.688
Detective Mooney, how
would you characterise

47:25.688 --> 47:28.346
Detective Sergeant Crellan's
statements?

47:29.002 --> 47:31.798
I would characterise
it as being inaccurate.

47:31.798 --> 47:34.145
And what do you
mean by inaccurate?

47:34.524 --> 47:36.630
Detective Sergeant Crellan is

47:36.630 --> 47:39.702
involved in corrupt activity.

47:41.152 --> 47:43.050
No, no,
silence, silence.

47:43.050 --> 47:46.502
Or we'll have to finish
these proceedings in camera.

47:49.677 --> 47:52.680
What kind of corrupt
activity, Detective?

47:55.304 --> 47:57.720
He's a part of a
group of police officers

47:57.720 --> 48:01.344
that take money from
known criminals to turn

48:01.344 --> 48:04.658
a blind eye to their
illegal activities.

48:04.658 --> 48:06.453
Right then,
how do you know that?

48:06.453 --> 48:07.868
Because I'm
part of that group.

48:07.868 --> 48:11.561
And do you have evidence to
support your allegations?

48:11.561 --> 48:12.804
Yes, I do.

48:12.804 --> 48:14.530
And how have you come
by that evidence?

48:14.530 --> 48:17.429
By wearing a wire for
the past nine months.

48:20.191 --> 48:23.573
And does Detective Sergeant
Crellan's corruption

48:23.573 --> 48:27.301
go beyond the graft
that you just described?

48:27.301 --> 48:30.788
- Yes.
- In what way, Detective?

48:32.548 --> 48:34.688
He was paid to kill
Nasa Kalouri.

48:35.862 --> 48:38.588
Silence,
silence please, thank you.

49:01.888 --> 49:03.648
See ya, brother.

49:07.100 --> 49:08.929
Wait your fucking turn.

49:13.485 --> 49:15.177
You're doing the
right thing, brother.

49:16.005 --> 49:17.627
I know.

49:25.497 --> 49:27.154
So, how would
you characterise

49:27.154 --> 49:28.673
the work that you do
in Kings Cross?

49:28.673 --> 49:31.227
I own and run
licenced venues.

49:32.953 --> 49:34.852
Do you stand over
other venues?

49:34.852 --> 49:36.543
- Stand over?
- Mm.

49:36.543 --> 49:37.993
- No.
- So, you are not

49:37.993 --> 49:39.373
currently in charge
of collecting

49:39.373 --> 49:40.961
protection money
in Kings Cross?

49:40.961 --> 49:43.101
I'd describe it
more like a co-op.

49:43.101 --> 49:45.586
You know, the club owners,
they pool resources

49:45.586 --> 49:47.174
to save on money,
that's all.

49:47.174 --> 49:48.624
And what about corrupt
payments made to the police

49:48.624 --> 49:51.834
for protection of these
venues, known as 'the laugh'?

49:51.834 --> 49:53.801
I don't know
anything about that.

49:53.801 --> 49:55.976
The only person I pay
is me, Mr Bolt.

49:55.976 --> 49:58.392
But that's more of an
administration fee.

49:58.392 --> 50:00.843
Do you sell drugs
in your clubs, Mr Ibrahim?

50:00.843 --> 50:03.777
No. Not me or anyone
working for me.

50:03.777 --> 50:05.434
Do you personally know any
drug dealers?

50:05.434 --> 50:06.469
Seriously?

50:06.711 --> 50:09.127
I work in the biggest red
light district in the country.

50:09.127 --> 50:11.681
That means I cross paths with
a lot of different people.

50:11.681 --> 50:13.580
Some of them may
indeed deal drugs.

50:13.580 --> 50:15.893
Given what we've heard in
this room over recent weeks,

50:15.893 --> 50:19.413
I would suggest that you
are the new life blood

50:19.413 --> 50:21.001
of the Kings Cross drug trade,

50:21.001 --> 50:25.557
and that you control the rivers
of gold that flow from it.

50:31.391 --> 50:32.875
So it would seem.

50:33.980 --> 50:36.120
- But I'm not.
- Really?

50:36.879 --> 50:39.433
Because we've heard testimony
from both Waali Mansour

50:39.433 --> 50:43.679
and Joey Romano, that would
strongly suggest that you are.

50:43.679 --> 50:47.786
Both very trustworthy,
reliable witnesses.

50:47.786 --> 50:49.961
I mean, Waali,
he says a lot of things.

50:49.961 --> 50:52.757
Half of them are untrue,
the other half are bullshit.

50:53.240 --> 50:54.276
Sorry.

50:54.759 --> 50:57.555
As for Joey, wasn't that the
guy that was hauled out of here

50:57.555 --> 50:59.350
for commercial scale
drug trafficking?

51:00.799 --> 51:02.042
Heh.

51:02.801 --> 51:04.700
I'm not a drug dealer,
Mr Bolt.

51:05.873 --> 51:07.910
But hey, if you've got
evidence to the contrary,

51:07.910 --> 51:09.118
why don't we just
cut to the chase

51:09.118 --> 51:10.257
and you can save me

51:10.257 --> 51:12.880
some of my hard earned
tax payer dollars?

51:18.162 --> 51:21.717
I would ask Mr Ibrahim to
stand down, Commissioner.

51:21.717 --> 51:24.962
However, I would ask
that he remain on hand

51:24.962 --> 51:27.378
in case we have
any further questions.

51:29.932 --> 51:32.176
You may stand down,
Mr Ibrahim.

51:32.176 --> 51:33.971
Thank you, Your Honour.

51:38.458 --> 51:40.874
Call your
next witness, Mr Bolt.

51:40.874 --> 51:42.151
Thank you, Commissioner.

51:42.151 --> 51:47.398
Calling Mr Richard 'Dickie'
Needham, please.

51:58.996 --> 52:00.998
Calling
Richard Needham.

52:04.863 --> 52:06.589
Calling Richard Needham?

52:15.426 --> 52:18.187
- He's not here.
- Mr Bolt?

52:19.223 --> 52:21.466
Crazy Viet bitch.

52:22.467 --> 52:23.986
You wanted him?

52:24.987 --> 52:26.368
You got him.

52:27.541 --> 52:29.474
It would appear
that your witness

52:29.474 --> 52:31.304
won't be
testifying today.

52:31.752 --> 52:34.790
We'll reconvene
Monday morning at 9 a.m.

52:54.292 --> 52:55.811
Bloody hell.

52:55.811 --> 52:58.262
- Hello?
- It's John.

52:58.262 --> 53:00.781
Oh, hi John,
just a moment.

53:00.781 --> 53:02.335
Here, John.

53:06.580 --> 53:07.857
Hey pal.

53:07.857 --> 53:09.549
I heard you knew in advance

53:09.549 --> 53:11.689
about the contract
on my brother's life.

53:12.862 --> 53:15.072
Yeah, yeah I did, yeah.

53:17.902 --> 53:20.456
But you chose not to warn me.

53:21.216 --> 53:22.665
No, I did warn you.

53:22.665 --> 53:25.703
I said that your brother
needs to sober up

53:25.703 --> 53:28.119
and get his ass back to
work, that's what I said,

53:28.119 --> 53:30.984
or he would end up
dead or in prison.

53:46.137 --> 53:50.037
- Has Dave rocked up yet?
- No.

53:50.037 --> 53:54.249
- Called and left a message.
- Call him again, will you.

54:03.603 --> 54:06.123
- No, no, no.
- Yes.

54:09.954 --> 54:12.508
You know, for a night club
owner, you're a terrible dancer.

54:14.476 --> 54:16.409
What if I don't
just own clubs?

54:17.410 --> 54:20.309
What if I was that guy they
were trying to paint me as
today?

54:20.309 --> 54:23.001
- But you're not.
- But what if I was?

54:24.658 --> 54:26.660
What if I'm not
what you think?

54:28.352 --> 54:34.289
Either way, you're still going
to have to learn how to dance.

55:15.157 --> 55:17.263
- I heard a shot.
- Got her?

55:17.263 --> 55:18.816
- Go.
