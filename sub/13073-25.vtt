{\an1}[whimpers]

19:07.412 --> 19:10.115
I've gathered you all
in the name of sport.

19:10.182 --> 19:12.551
The "best kid" competition
rematch.

19:12.618 --> 19:16.355
Now, time will only allow
for one event.

19:16.421 --> 19:20.759
The most ancient of all trials--
The sack race.

19:20.826 --> 19:25.130
At the end of the race, we shall
crown Princess the winner.

19:25.197 --> 19:26.498
{\an3}No, Dad.

19:26.565 --> 19:28.667
{\an3}Remember, we're doing it
fair this time.

19:28.734 --> 19:30.168
Yeah, Princess!

19:30.235 --> 19:32.671
{\an1}You're doing
the right thing.

19:32.738 --> 19:34.706
{\an3}All right, stay
in your jumping sacks,

19:34.773 --> 19:37.442
{\an3}and the first to the finish line
is the winner.

19:37.509 --> 19:39.444
{\an1}Hey, Princess,
good luck.

19:39.511 --> 19:41.613
May the best kid win.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.348
(Dr. Roberts)
On your mark.

19:43.415 --> 19:45.083
- [growls]
- Get set.

19:45.150 --> 19:46.184
[blows whistle]

19:46.251 --> 19:47.419
{\an3}[grunting]

19:47.486 --> 19:48.921
- [grunting]
- Whoa!

19:48.987 --> 19:50.722
[both grunting]

19:50.789 --> 19:53.425
{\an3}Oh, no.
Princess forgot the plan.

19:53.492 --> 19:55.394
{\an1}She didn't forget.
She's cheating.

19:55.460 --> 19:58.096
{\an3}Oh, right. We have to stop her.
[grunting]

19:58.163 --> 19:59.398
Way ahead of ya.

19:59.464 --> 20:00.666
Foo, let's do it.

20:00.732 --> 20:03.268
{\an1}Okay.

20:05.103 --> 20:06.038
Huh!

20:06.104 --> 20:08.073
{\an3}[grunting]

20:08.140 --> 20:10.008
[both grunting]

20:10.075 --> 20:12.210
She's not slowing down.

20:13.111 --> 20:15.280
[panting]

20:15.347 --> 20:18.283
{\an1}- Princess, stop!
- [grunts]

20:18.350 --> 20:20.886
Quit riding my coattail!

20:20.953 --> 20:24.423
[grunting]

20:24.489 --> 20:25.624
{\an1}[gasps]

20:25.691 --> 20:27.159
{\an3}[grunting]

20:28.360 --> 20:30.529
{\an1}Princess,
you promised to play fair.

20:30.596 --> 20:33.198
{\an3}Go away!
I want that trophy!

20:33.265 --> 20:35.834
Guys, help!
[warbling]

20:35.901 --> 20:38.136
{\an3}[gasps]
Harvey's distress signal.

20:38.203 --> 20:39.171
We're coming, buddy!

20:39.237 --> 20:43.775
[all yelling]

20:43.842 --> 20:47.145
[all straining]

20:47.212 --> 20:49.147
Claire's too far behind.

20:49.214 --> 20:50.849
Princess, stop!

20:50.916 --> 20:52.684
Ah, ha ha ha ha!

20:54.920 --> 20:56.088
Huh?

20:56.154 --> 20:58.724
[magical music]

20:58.790 --> 21:02.394
{\an3}Peasant girl, why have you come
to my magical palace?

21:02.461 --> 21:05.497
{\an1}Oh, Princess,
I've come to humbly offer

21:05.564 --> 21:07.833
{\an1}a gift,
this simple doll.

21:07.899 --> 21:09.101
It's all I have.

21:09.167 --> 21:10.836
{\an3}Gimme!
Cool.

21:10.902 --> 21:14.606
{\an1}You honor me.
And now, I can die in peace.

21:16.174 --> 21:18.810
[magical music]

21:20.078 --> 21:22.080
[grunting]

21:22.147 --> 21:24.783
[panting]
Wait, I won?

21:24.850 --> 21:26.118
I really won?

21:26.184 --> 21:29.688
{\an3}And the winner is...
Princess!

21:29.755 --> 21:32.124
No, Dad.
Give it to Claire.

21:32.190 --> 21:33.725
She won fair and square.

21:33.792 --> 21:36.028
{\an3}Darling, that doesn't
sound like you.

21:36.094 --> 21:38.764
{\an3}Have you been possessed
by a dark energy?

21:38.830 --> 21:40.098
Give it to her!

21:40.165 --> 21:42.701
{\an3}All right, whatever makes
my sunshine happy.

21:42.768 --> 21:45.337
{\an3}The winner is not
my daughter.

21:45.404 --> 21:48.674
I get to write
my first victory report.

21:48.740 --> 21:51.243
{\an3}- Hey, that was pretty fun.
- You're strong.

21:51.309 --> 21:52.944
Princess,
you did the right thing.

21:53.011 --> 21:55.580
In fact, I think you deserve
another trophy.

21:55.647 --> 21:57.849
The sweetheart of the--
Oh, she's already gone.

21:57.916 --> 22:00.686
