- SHE IS AN IMPOSTER.

21:06.014 --> 21:08.392
WHAT RIGHT DOES SHE HAVE?

21:08.475 --> 21:10.018
I, ROBERT,

21:10.102 --> 21:12.104
I HAVE SERVED YOU ALWAYS.

21:12.187 --> 21:15.983
- I SEE YOU CRAVE RECOGNITION
FOR YOUR SERVICE.

21:16.066 --> 21:17.484
- I THINK I HAVE EARNED IT.

21:17.567 --> 21:21.154
ALL OF MY LIFE,
I HAVE WAITED FOR THIS.

21:21.238 --> 21:22.614
ROBERT, WITH YOUR KNOWLEDGE,

21:22.698 --> 21:25.867
WE CAN BE RICH AND POWERFUL
BEYOND OUR WILDEST DREAMS.

21:25.951 --> 21:28.120
- MY KNOWLEDGE.

21:28.203 --> 21:30.539
AND WHAT WILL YOU BRING,

21:30.622 --> 21:32.874
APART FROM GREED?

21:32.958 --> 21:34.710
- YES.

21:34.793 --> 21:35.877
YES, I AM GREEDY.

21:35.961 --> 21:37.921
IT'S TRUE.

21:38.005 --> 21:39.298
BUT THIS IS WHAT I CAN BRING:

21:39.381 --> 21:39.965
DETERMINATION,

21:40.048 --> 21:42.759
HUNGER FOR SUCCESS,

21:42.843 --> 21:44.886
THE CONSTANT PURSUIT OF MORE,

21:44.970 --> 21:46.888
AMBITION, ROBERT.

21:46.972 --> 21:50.058
THE GREEDY
ARE ALWAYS WANTING.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.309
[warbling tone]

21:51.393 --> 21:53.395
- [in demonic voice]
INDEED, THEY ARE, VICTOR.

21:56.148 --> 21:57.733
- ROBERT.

21:57.816 --> 21:58.942
- [hissing]

21:59.026 --> 22:01.361
- ROBERT.

22:01.445 --> 22:02.904
I SEEK ONLY TO--

22:02.988 --> 22:06.074
- [laughing maniacally]
