00:50.801 --> 00:53.595
-I'm here!-Where have you been?

00:54.555 --> 00:55.639
Nowhere.

00:56.682 --> 00:59.184
Come on, or we'll be late.

01:00.519 --> 01:01.812
Hello, class.

01:01.895 --> 01:05.232
My name is Professor Yuckyuck, and--

01:07.442 --> 01:10.237
And this is Laugh Lab.

01:10.863 --> 01:13.282
Now, laughter is a serious thing.

01:13.365 --> 01:15.117
The more laughter in the world,

01:15.200 --> 01:17.703
the less destructivethe humans seem to be.

01:17.786 --> 01:19.538
Questions so far?

01:21.248 --> 01:22.916
No questions at this time.

01:23.709 --> 01:26.378
Now, this is a stone face.

01:26.879 --> 01:30.632
Our job is to crack it upto release the laughlings.

01:30.716 --> 01:31.884
Observe.

01:48.192 --> 01:49.526
This is a laughling.

01:51.737 --> 01:53.572
A giggle, to be exact.

01:53.655 --> 01:55.240
And this is what it does.

02:03.624 --> 02:08.461
Every laugh spryte has their own approachfor cracking up the stone faces.

02:15.052 --> 02:16.637
Some tell jokes.

02:17.930 --> 02:20.057
Some put on funny plays.

02:20.891 --> 02:23.060
It takes years of dedication

02:23.143 --> 02:27.523
to hone the skills requiredto become a laugh spryte.

02:30.317 --> 02:33.278
The spryteling show is in one week.

02:33.362 --> 02:37.991
Your assignment is to devise an actto crack up the stone faces.

02:38.075 --> 02:42.079
And please take it seriously.

02:42.913 --> 02:45.082
-So cool.-I don't know what I'm doing.

02:45.165 --> 02:47.084
-I can't wait.-This is exciting.

02:47.876 --> 02:49.253
I've got it.

02:49.336 --> 02:51.463
I'll write us a silly play.

02:51.547 --> 02:54.383
The silliest playthat anyone's ever sillied.

02:54.967 --> 02:58.554
We've got to rehearseif we're gonna crack open a stone face.

02:58.637 --> 02:59.888
Stem promise?

03:00.430 --> 03:02.641
-Stem promise!-Stem promise!

03:03.475 --> 03:05.769
Oh, no. That's garbage.

03:05.853 --> 03:07.855
Nobody's gonna laugh at that.

03:09.273 --> 03:10.941
Think, Sprout. Think.

03:11.942 --> 03:14.361
Oh, my goodness. That's such a good idea.

03:15.571 --> 03:17.447
Everyone's gonna love this.

03:22.578 --> 03:24.746
Good morning!

03:26.039 --> 03:27.291
What time is it?

03:28.500 --> 03:30.752
Seems like it's still yesterday.

03:30.836 --> 03:33.797
I know it's early,but if we're gonna do this right,

03:33.881 --> 03:36.592
we gotta start practicing right away.

03:37.593 --> 03:38.760
This looks fun.

03:39.595 --> 03:40.762
Wolfy.

03:40.846 --> 03:43.182
So, I put my arms in here…

03:45.726 --> 03:46.852
Okay.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.104
Xandra?

03:49.188 --> 03:50.230
I'm sorry.

03:50.314 --> 03:53.775
-Sorry. Sorry.-And action!

03:53.859 --> 03:56.737
"Welcome to the Fancy Lab,

03:56.820 --> 03:58.822
the fanciest joint in the realm."

03:59.823 --> 04:01.992
"Are you sure you're fancy enough?"

04:02.075 --> 04:03.368
Quite sure.

04:03.452 --> 04:07.748
"Wonderful.Then please partake of our fancy food."

04:13.754 --> 04:17.298
Sir, are you sure you're fancy?

04:17.382 --> 04:22.262
I'm so fancy.Fancy enough to make a toast to the chef.

04:25.807 --> 04:27.559
Hey, this is funny.

04:27.643 --> 04:30.187
Thanks. But we've got a lot of work to do

04:30.270 --> 04:33.023
if we're going to crack upthose stone faces.

04:33.524 --> 04:35.234
Here's a rehearsal schedule.

04:36.276 --> 04:40.572
We have a week until the big show,and we need to practice every day.

04:41.657 --> 04:45.077
Wait, what time is it? I've got to go.

04:46.411 --> 04:49.289
Where is he going? We're his only friends.

04:49.373 --> 04:52.626
Don't know. But I'm surehe'll be at the next rehearsal.

04:52.709 --> 04:54.753
He stem promised.

04:59.508 --> 05:05.013
That's it. Be one with the wisps.Let them connect to your creativity.

05:06.515 --> 05:08.767
Whoops. I'm sorry.

05:08.851 --> 05:12.688
Don't be sorry.You must work with the whoopses.

05:12.771 --> 05:14.565
Feel the harmony.

05:15.399 --> 05:17.568
Now, big finish.

05:23.574 --> 05:24.825
You're a natural.

05:24.908 --> 05:26.118
That was fun.

05:26.618 --> 05:27.786
Same time tomorrow?

05:27.870 --> 05:30.706
What, leaving already?We've only just started.

05:31.915 --> 05:35.586
Well, I told SproutI'd practice our play for Laugh Lab.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.796
It doesn't sound quite as important

05:37.880 --> 05:41.049
as preparing to save the worldfrom eternal darkness, does it?

05:44.720 --> 05:49.016
Please be carefulwith this very fancy second course.

05:49.766 --> 05:52.603
Luckily, I am very fancy.

05:52.686 --> 05:55.522
And I won't drop a crumb.

06:02.988 --> 06:04.531
Where is he?

06:10.495 --> 06:13.624
You must be determined,courageous, selfless.

06:13.707 --> 06:16.001
Now, ready for another one?

06:17.336 --> 06:21.298
Yeah, but how is this preparing mefor the disarrays, exactly?

06:21.798 --> 06:23.967
Balance is the key.

06:24.051 --> 06:27.763
How do you plan on fixing thatif you don't have it yourself?

06:36.813 --> 06:39.024
I'm coming, Sprout!

06:40.400 --> 06:42.778
Nice of you to join us, Wolfboy.

06:44.279 --> 06:45.697
Okay.

06:45.781 --> 06:51.328
It would be a shame to spill this bluemash-shake on my fancy new shirt.

06:54.540 --> 06:55.666
Wolfboy?

06:55.749 --> 06:57.668
Haven't you learned the script?

07:29.157 --> 07:31.159
Why don't we take it from the top?

07:32.744 --> 07:35.539
Let me guess, you have to go?

07:39.376 --> 07:40.460
Okay.

07:41.712 --> 07:46.258
But, Wolfy, you will know your partby tomorrow, right?

07:46.842 --> 07:49.469
Yeah. Definitely. Stem promise.

08:03.400 --> 08:06.069
Okay, sock rockets, do your thing.

08:07.863 --> 08:09.198
And go!

08:20.042 --> 08:21.335
It's working.

08:31.094 --> 08:33.222
Well, very good.

08:33.304 --> 08:34.890
That's enough for today.

08:34.972 --> 08:38.477
-I'll see you same time tomorrow.-But tomorrow's Sprout's play.

08:38.559 --> 08:42.397
The fate of the worldrests on your shoulders.

08:42.481 --> 08:43.649
I know, sir.

08:43.732 --> 08:46.777
But I promised my friendsI'd be there for Laugh Lab.

08:46.860 --> 08:51.365
If you're not ready when the time comes,there might not be any labs left at all.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.076
We're all depending on you.

09:03.585 --> 09:04.795
Where have you been?

09:04.878 --> 09:07.047
You missed almost every rehearsal.

09:07.130 --> 09:08.966
I know. I'm so sorry.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.343
You know how much this means to Sprout.

09:15.931 --> 09:19.059
I hope you're going to be readyfor the show tomorrow.

09:58.599 --> 10:01.852
-"Welcome to Fancy Lab… This fancy mash…"-Ready, Wolfy?

10:01.935 --> 10:03.103
Uh-huh.

10:03.937 --> 10:06.899
Wolfboy, message for you.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.986
Come at once. Time is of the essence.

10:11.069 --> 10:12.613
Professor Luxcraft.

10:13.989 --> 10:15.240
I have to go.

10:23.957 --> 10:25.417
Is everything all right?

10:26.001 --> 10:27.544
No, it's not.

10:28.879 --> 10:31.548
I've misplaced my sandwich.

10:31.632 --> 10:33.008
I had it in my hand.

10:33.091 --> 10:37.387
It looked very much like a sandwich.It's sandwich-shaped.

10:37.471 --> 10:39.306
Can't have left this room.

10:48.774 --> 10:50.901
Next up, Blip.

10:50.984 --> 10:54.154
Oh, crumbs. We're on after Blip.

10:54.238 --> 10:56.490
Hey. He'll be here, Sprout.

10:57.366 --> 10:58.575
He'd better be.

10:58.659 --> 11:00.744
I'm coming, Sprout!

11:00.827 --> 11:02.579
It was in my beard!

11:13.006 --> 11:17.302
Next up, Sprout, Wolfboy and Xandra.

11:22.307 --> 11:26.270
Welcome to the Fancy Lab,the fanciest joint in the realm.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.605
Are you sure you're fancy enough?

11:28.689 --> 11:30.524
Quite sure.

11:30.607 --> 11:32.067
Wonderful.

11:32.150 --> 11:34.611
Then please, partake of our fancy food.

11:59.636 --> 12:01.388
Okay.

12:01.889 --> 12:05.350
Thank you for that play.

12:05.851 --> 12:07.394
Let's see, who's next?

12:07.477 --> 12:09.396
I'm here! I'm here!

12:09.479 --> 12:11.815
I've got your arms, Sprout.

12:20.991 --> 12:24.036
Sprout, I'm so sorry.

12:26.205 --> 12:27.497
You stem promised.

12:27.581 --> 12:30.209
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

12:31.210 --> 12:34.630
Look, I know you were excitedabout this play.

12:34.713 --> 12:35.881
But I--

12:37.132 --> 12:40.010
I was excited to do a play with you.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.180
That was the whole point.

12:45.349 --> 12:47.643
Look,there's something important I'm doing.

12:47.726 --> 12:49.603
More important than us?

12:52.064 --> 12:53.065
I'm sorry.

12:56.235 --> 12:59.571
Clearly you three did not preparefor your assignment,

12:59.655 --> 13:01.698
and now look what you've done.

13:03.283 --> 13:04.284
Detention!

13:17.256 --> 13:21.426
It will take the laugh sprytes weeksto replace the laughlings you let loose.

13:22.219 --> 13:26.139
A nice long detention in the Scrub Hubshould help you clean up your act.

13:26.223 --> 13:28.225
Sneffton, keep an eye on them.

13:28.767 --> 13:32.771
I knew I was right to put you on the list.

13:33.272 --> 13:37.109
Now, there's a tree over therethat isn't gonna untangle itself.

14:04.678 --> 14:07.389
Hey, Sprout, look. Guess who I am.

14:07.931 --> 14:10.601
Fribbity-frobbity, jibbity sandwich.

14:10.684 --> 14:13.312
You three better clean up your act.

14:17.691 --> 14:20.611
Look,I know it's my fault we're in detention.

14:21.111 --> 14:25.073
-I let the laughlings out.-That's not why we're cross with you.

14:25.157 --> 14:26.783
-It's not?-No!

14:26.867 --> 14:30.454
We're cross because you didn't show upwhen you said you were going to.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.956
You embarrassed us in front of everyone.

14:33.040 --> 14:36.210
And more importantly,you really let Sprout down.

14:37.586 --> 14:41.924
I'm sorry I missed the play.But I promise I had a really good reason.

14:42.007 --> 14:43.592
Oh, yeah? What was it?

14:45.260 --> 14:47.804
Well, I can't tell you the reason.

14:47.888 --> 14:49.765
Whatever your phony reason is,

14:49.848 --> 14:53.101
it's clearly more important to youthan we are.

14:54.061 --> 14:56.563
Maybe I was right about youfrom the start.

14:57.564 --> 14:58.565
Sprout?

14:59.274 --> 15:01.151
Please say something.

15:01.235 --> 15:03.987
You promised you'd be there, Wolfy.

15:04.071 --> 15:07.366
You stem promised, and then you weren't.

15:07.449 --> 15:09.701
And you won't even tell us why.

15:09.785 --> 15:14.957
You're right. You're my best friends.I owe you the truth about where I've been.

15:15.958 --> 15:19.253
It turns out there is a prophecy.And I do have powers.

15:19.336 --> 15:22.589
I've been training to save the worldfrom the forces of chaos

15:22.673 --> 15:26.760
in a secret cavern full of wispsunderneath Professor Luxcraft's office.

15:26.844 --> 15:28.345
And I wanted to tell you,

15:28.428 --> 15:30.889
but Luxcraft told meI couldn't tell anyone,

15:30.973 --> 15:35.102
because if I did, they'd be in danger.And I wanted to protect you.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.022
You expect us to believe

15:39.106 --> 15:42.317
you've been trainingto save the world in some "wisp cave"

15:42.401 --> 15:45.487
that I've never heard ofand definitely doesn't exist?

15:45.571 --> 15:46.738
It does exist.

15:46.822 --> 15:49.658
There's a secret trapdoorin Luxcraft's office.

15:49.741 --> 15:51.285
You have to believe me.

15:51.368 --> 15:55.873
I'm telling you the truth.I promise. I stem promise.

15:56.498 --> 16:00.043
But you don't always keepyour stem promises, do you?

16:00.627 --> 16:01.920
Sprout.

16:02.004 --> 16:05.883
That's right, Leafy.Don't you listen to him.

16:06.592 --> 16:11.722
Promises are made to be brokenand friends always let you down.

16:11.805 --> 16:14.266
You take it from me.

16:14.349 --> 16:15.642
Who are you?

16:15.726 --> 16:18.979
Someone who knows not to trust anyone.

16:20.606 --> 16:22.858
Especially your friends.

16:29.823 --> 16:33.785
-Do you live in this pipe?-I live wherever I like.

16:33.869 --> 16:37.372
These pipes connect every roomin the factory.

16:37.456 --> 16:39.374
I come and go as I please.

16:41.835 --> 16:43.086
Did you hear that?

16:43.170 --> 16:46.006
These pipes run throughoutthe whole factory.

16:46.089 --> 16:49.676
I bet we could take themall the way to Luxcraft's office.

16:49.760 --> 16:52.971
Then I can show you the trapdoorand the cavern of wisps.

16:53.055 --> 16:55.390
And prove I'm telling the truth.

16:56.600 --> 16:57.809
I don't know.

16:58.393 --> 17:01.438
What if we get in trouble?What about Sneffton?

17:01.980 --> 17:05.025
Miscreants…

17:05.776 --> 17:09.238
We'll be back before he even realizeswe're gone.

17:09.320 --> 17:12.031
Besides, I'd takea week's worth of detention

17:12.115 --> 17:14.742
if that's what it takesto save our friendship.

17:15.243 --> 17:16.286
Fine.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.914
Let's see this cavern of wisps, then.

17:18.997 --> 17:21.375
I've had enough cleaning for one day,anyway.

17:27.923 --> 17:31.176
How are we gonna find the wayto Luxcraft's office?

17:31.260 --> 17:32.594
Leave that to me.

17:39.768 --> 17:41.019
Behold!

17:41.103 --> 17:43.063
The Whithervane.

17:44.398 --> 17:48.485
Wolfy! Your powers… They're working?

17:48.569 --> 17:50.696
That's what I've been trying to tell you.

17:50.779 --> 17:53.282
Luxcraft's been teaching meto use the wisps.

17:54.032 --> 17:55.534
Okay, Whithervane.

17:55.617 --> 17:58.996
Whither shall we goto get to Luxcraft's office?

18:02.249 --> 18:03.667
This way.

18:10.215 --> 18:13.302
Wolfy, are we close?

18:13.385 --> 18:15.345
I don't like it down here.

18:15.846 --> 18:16.972
Don't worry, Sprout.

18:17.055 --> 18:18.849
It can't be too much further.

18:21.810 --> 18:23.687
See, I bet it's just through here.

18:23.770 --> 18:27.482
I wouldn't go down there if I were you.

18:27.566 --> 18:28.859
Are you following us?

18:28.942 --> 18:33.071
These are my pipes. You're following me.

18:34.364 --> 18:36.366
Come on. Let's just go.

18:36.450 --> 18:41.038
I don't know, Wolfy.It looks kinda dark down there.

18:42.372 --> 18:45.459
Now, this way seems much friendlier.

18:46.877 --> 18:49.254
But the Whithervane says it's this way.

18:50.130 --> 18:51.298
Come on.

18:51.381 --> 18:53.884
Don't you trust him.

18:59.681 --> 19:01.725
I can't see anything.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.227
Just trust me.

19:03.310 --> 19:06.563
How do you knowthis whatsawhoosit of yours works?

19:07.397 --> 19:11.735
Luxcraft says the key isto believe in whatever you're making.

19:11.818 --> 19:16.031
As long as you believe in it,there's no limits to what you can create.

19:16.114 --> 19:18.534
So as long as I believein the Whithervane,

19:18.617 --> 19:19.618
Wolfy!

19:19.701 --> 19:20.827
No, no--

19:36.134 --> 19:39.096
I warned you not to trust him.

19:41.473 --> 19:44.017
This is not Professor Luxcraft's office.

19:44.101 --> 19:46.270
It must have been a shortcut.

19:47.729 --> 19:50.649
Yeah, look. It's pointing down here now.

19:50.732 --> 19:53.694
Oh, no. No, no.

19:53.777 --> 19:58.073
I'm not following youor that thing anymore.

19:58.156 --> 19:59.449
-But---Just admit it.

19:59.533 --> 20:01.034
You messed up in Laugh Lab,

20:01.118 --> 20:05.038
and then you made up some storyso you wouldn't seem like a bad friend.

20:05.122 --> 20:09.084
And now you're making it worseby getting us lost in these dumb pipes.

20:09.168 --> 20:10.294
Come on, Sprout.

20:17.092 --> 20:20.179
What are you guys so scared of?Where are you going?

20:21.972 --> 20:24.766
Whithervane, whither is danger?

20:30.314 --> 20:33.025
Hey, I think there's something coming.

20:33.108 --> 20:35.736
I really thinkwe should get out of this pipe.

20:35.819 --> 20:39.823
Forget it. We're not following youor that piece of junk anymore.

20:39.907 --> 20:41.325
But there's something coming.

20:44.953 --> 20:46.663
Wait, Xandra. Go, go, go.

20:51.543 --> 20:52.544
Thanks.

20:54.546 --> 20:56.757
What are you thanking him for?

20:56.840 --> 20:58.592
If it wasn't for him,

20:58.675 --> 21:01.845
you wouldn't be down herein the first place.

21:01.929 --> 21:03.680
Why are you trying to cause trouble?

21:03.764 --> 21:08.310
I'm only trying to save youfrom what happened to me.

21:08.393 --> 21:10.187
What happened to you?

21:10.270 --> 21:12.189
I had friends once.

21:12.272 --> 21:14.024
Friends I trusted.

21:14.107 --> 21:19.530
But then, one year on my birthday,I decided to throw a little party.

21:19.613 --> 21:20.864
I love parties--

21:20.948 --> 21:24.576
I asked these so-called friendsif they'd like to come.

21:24.660 --> 21:28.705
Every single one of themsaid they were too busy.

21:28.789 --> 21:30.374
Oh, no.

21:30.457 --> 21:31.542
Oh, yes.

21:32.292 --> 21:37.381
That night when I got home,there they all are, laying in wait for me.

21:37.464 --> 21:41.802
I walk in and they shout at me,"Surprise! Hey, you!"

21:42.553 --> 21:44.638
How they laughed at me.

21:44.721 --> 21:46.932
Those treacherous liars.

21:47.766 --> 21:49.142
-But---From that day on,

21:49.226 --> 21:51.645
I vowed I'd never trust anyone,

21:51.728 --> 21:54.857
and I came to live down here on my own.

21:54.940 --> 21:56.733
If you don't trust anyone,

21:56.817 --> 21:59.236
nobody can ever hurt you.

22:04.157 --> 22:08.787
I do not wanna end up like her,living in these pipes.

22:08.871 --> 22:09.872
Me neither.

22:10.706 --> 22:13.417
So,where does the silly thing say to go next?

22:19.339 --> 22:22.259
Luxcraft's office must be through here.

22:27.222 --> 22:29.683
The trapdoor is all the way at the bottom.

22:35.147 --> 22:37.357
-You convinced me, Luxcraft.-Hide!

22:37.441 --> 22:40.152
Have patience. They will come around.

22:40.235 --> 22:42.321
Why will they not listen?

22:42.404 --> 22:45.282
-Give them time.-We do not have time.

22:45.365 --> 22:46.575
But, Luxcraft,

22:46.658 --> 22:50.829
if he's as powerful as you think he is,he could be dangerous.

22:52.289 --> 22:55.459
-I believe I can control him.-How can you be certain?

22:56.043 --> 22:58.212
Humans cannot be trusted.

22:58.295 --> 23:01.298
If he were to make the wrong choice--

23:01.381 --> 23:04.343
He cannot choose a pathhe doesn't know exists.

23:04.426 --> 23:06.970
But if he does realizewhat he's capable of…

23:07.054 --> 23:09.473
He won't. I'll make sure of it.

23:26.782 --> 23:29.034
Scrub Hub bubbles?

23:41.171 --> 23:44.383
We've gotta get back to the Scrub Hubbefore Luxcraft does.

23:44.466 --> 23:46.218
How are we going to do that?

23:48.095 --> 23:49.805
I have an idea.

24:02.150 --> 24:03.944
Hi, Luxcraft!

24:04.528 --> 24:06.405
We're friends.

24:17.082 --> 24:18.542
We made it.

24:18.625 --> 24:21.503
Hey, what do you thinkLuxcraft meant back there?

24:21.587 --> 24:24.256
What's he trying to stop mefrom finding out?

24:26.675 --> 24:27.676
Quick.

24:39.021 --> 24:40.022
Sneffton?

24:40.606 --> 24:44.735
-Have they been here the whole day?-No, sir-- Yes, sir-- Absolutely.

24:44.818 --> 24:46.695
No one has gotten past me.

24:46.778 --> 24:47.779
Good, good.

24:47.863 --> 24:52.784
Just checkingeverything was under control.
