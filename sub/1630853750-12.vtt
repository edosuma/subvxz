00:07.298 --> 00:12.721
So, what I'm asking is, Mel Monroe...

00:15.807 --> 00:17.308
will you marry me?

00:21.021 --> 00:23.314
Of course I'll marry you. Yes.

00:28.361 --> 00:31.072
-You took your time to answer.
-Sorry.

00:31.156 --> 00:32.073
I'm sorry.

00:33.199 --> 00:35.243
Oh, wait, wait. We gotta do this.

00:35.326 --> 00:36.619
Oh, okay.

00:38.663 --> 00:40.040
It's so pretty.

01:30.715 --> 01:32.092
That looks good on you.

01:34.886 --> 01:36.012
It's beautiful.

01:38.681 --> 01:41.267
I still can't believe you got us a suite.

01:41.893 --> 01:45.396
I think the occasion calls
for something more extravagant than...

01:46.106 --> 01:46.981
the Airstream.

01:47.065 --> 01:47.982
Hmm.

01:48.900 --> 01:50.193
Well, I'm feeling...

01:51.069 --> 01:52.946
very spoiled. Thank you.

01:53.029 --> 01:54.239
Aw.

01:54.739 --> 01:57.826
-Oh, come on.

02:03.289 --> 02:04.124
Is it work?

02:04.207 --> 02:05.333
Um...

02:06.626 --> 02:07.794
No, it's, uh...

02:09.963 --> 02:12.715
the lab results from our paternity test.

02:13.716 --> 02:16.636
Well, that was only like... two days ago.

02:16.719 --> 02:18.429
I know, she put a rush on it.

02:23.685 --> 02:25.061
So, what do you wanna do?

02:25.770 --> 02:26.980
What are my options?

02:27.856 --> 02:31.651
Well, we can open it now...

02:32.152 --> 02:34.779
-or we can wait till we get home.
-Or next year.

02:34.863 --> 02:37.574
-It's not...
-Do you want me to just delete it?

02:37.657 --> 02:38.616
No, I'm kidding.

02:39.742 --> 02:40.994
Unless you want to.

02:41.786 --> 02:43.496
No. No.

02:46.708 --> 02:49.335
-What?
-It's just, I've...

02:50.336 --> 02:53.715
been thinking about this moment
ever since I got pregnant,

02:53.798 --> 02:57.260
and now that we're finally here, I...

03:01.181 --> 03:03.725
-What if it's not--?
-Hey, if it's not...

03:04.726 --> 03:08.062
we will be upset and disappointed.

03:08.563 --> 03:09.898
-Sure.
-Mm-hm.

03:11.191 --> 03:14.110
We always knew that was a possibility
from the beginning, right?

03:15.195 --> 03:19.324
So we'll deal. We'll move on
and we will focus on starting our family.

03:19.407 --> 03:21.492
I don't care what that e-mail says.

03:22.952 --> 03:24.078
I love you.

03:25.246 --> 03:28.082
And I'm gonna love our baby so much.

03:29.417 --> 03:30.460
I love you too.

03:32.253 --> 03:33.296
I'm sorry.

03:34.255 --> 03:35.381
Why?

03:35.465 --> 03:38.593
We wouldn't be in this position
if it wasn't for me.

03:38.676 --> 03:40.345
Oh, hey, no.

03:40.428 --> 03:43.348
This is not your fault.
I have never thought that. I never will.

03:43.431 --> 03:46.643
-If I hadn't gone to the clinic--
-If I hadn't broken up with you...

03:48.228 --> 03:52.065
Listen, we are not here
because of you, all right?

03:52.148 --> 03:53.650
We're here because of us.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.903
We might not be perfect, but...

03:58.154 --> 03:59.322
we are together.

03:59.405 --> 04:02.533
That's the only thing that matters,
you and me.

04:03.660 --> 04:05.370
Look, we got this, okay?

04:08.706 --> 04:09.540
Come on.

04:10.208 --> 04:11.042
Okay.

04:12.710 --> 04:14.629
Okay. All right.

04:28.893 --> 04:30.311
"Not excluded."

04:31.813 --> 04:33.356
Not excluded?

04:38.111 --> 04:39.737
It means you're the father.

04:40.405 --> 04:41.239
What?

04:44.867 --> 04:46.452
It means that you're the father.

04:48.037 --> 04:49.497
And we're having a girl.

04:53.960 --> 04:56.004
-Oh, holy crap.
-Yeah.

04:56.671 --> 04:58.881
-We're having a little girl?
-Yeah.

05:04.387 --> 05:07.223
Oh, I'm so happy right now.

05:12.145 --> 05:13.271
-Hey.
-Hey.

05:13.354 --> 05:14.856
I didn't hear you get up.

05:14.939 --> 05:17.567
Yeah, that's 'cause
you were out like a light.

05:20.111 --> 05:21.487
What's all this?

05:22.155 --> 05:26.200
Well, decided you deserved better
than an empty fridge.

05:30.621 --> 05:35.793
So did you get a chance
to look over the pamphlet Mel gave me?

05:38.338 --> 05:41.424
Brady, you don't have to worry about me.
I'm okay.

05:41.507 --> 05:44.719
I want you to be honest with me.
If you're hurting, I--

05:45.386 --> 05:47.555
I wanna know about it so I can help.

05:47.638 --> 05:51.642
Yeah, I just don't want everything
to be about that.

05:51.726 --> 05:54.395
If I touch you and you're not into it--

05:54.479 --> 05:57.857
Brady, stop, okay?

05:59.442 --> 06:02.070
I don't want you
to walk around on eggshells.

06:03.321 --> 06:05.615
I want you to be like you were before.

06:08.159 --> 06:10.495
-I don't know--
-If something's going on with me...

06:11.204 --> 06:12.538
I will tell you, okay?

06:14.290 --> 06:15.124
Got it.

06:16.501 --> 06:18.628
Be honest with your feelings too.

06:19.295 --> 06:20.630
-Yeah?
-Mm-hm.

06:20.713 --> 06:21.714
That right?

06:21.798 --> 06:22.673
What?

06:23.257 --> 06:24.759
Always negotiating.

06:24.842 --> 06:26.636
That's 'cause I'm good at it.

06:26.719 --> 06:27.887
Yeah, you are.

06:31.766 --> 06:33.893
-I love you.
-I love you.

06:34.644 --> 06:35.603
Yeah.

06:35.686 --> 06:40.441
All I am saying is that I would be happy
to find an aide for you.

06:40.525 --> 06:45.446
I'm perfectly capable of hiring
my own sitter, thank you very much.

06:45.530 --> 06:48.241
Besides, I'm the one who has
to spend time with this person,

06:48.324 --> 06:51.119
so I should be the one
who makes the decision.

06:51.202 --> 06:53.704
I was just gonna set up some interviews.

06:53.788 --> 06:56.124
Good gravy, we're not hiring a CEO.

06:56.207 --> 06:58.084
Then what do you have in mind?

06:58.960 --> 07:01.129
I was thinking about asking Lizzie.

07:01.212 --> 07:03.047
She did a good job with my plants,

07:03.131 --> 07:05.800
and they're much
more temperamental than I am.

07:06.426 --> 07:07.593
That's very funny.

07:08.719 --> 07:10.596
Lizzie is a very good idea.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.932
-It was Chuck's idea.
-And who's Chuck?

07:13.015 --> 07:14.809
My one good brain cell.

07:16.602 --> 07:17.437
I'll get it.

07:22.692 --> 07:23.526
Hello?

07:24.819 --> 07:25.862
Hold, please.

07:26.362 --> 07:27.780
Denny, it's for you.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.533
Yeah, he'll be here in one second.

07:34.662 --> 07:35.496
Hello?

07:39.625 --> 07:40.793
Oh, okay.

07:41.294 --> 07:42.503
Yeah, I can do that.

07:45.423 --> 07:47.133
Got it. Thanks. Bye.

07:49.594 --> 07:52.472
The doctor said my test results confirmed
I was just dehydrated.

07:52.555 --> 07:54.807
So I'm supposed
to increase my fluid intake.

07:54.891 --> 07:56.642
Well, that seems easy enough.

07:56.726 --> 07:58.144
Totally not a big deal.

07:58.227 --> 08:02.064
Yeah, but you do need to start
taking better care of yourself.

08:02.857 --> 08:04.066
Definitely.

08:04.942 --> 08:05.818
Look...

08:07.570 --> 08:09.947
Denny, I'm very concerned about you.

08:11.657 --> 08:13.034
I appreciate that.

08:13.117 --> 08:14.869
But I have to do this my way.

08:14.952 --> 08:17.455
What if you had been driving
when you passed out,

08:17.538 --> 08:20.583
or on a hike, you could have
fallen down, hit your head on a rock.

08:20.666 --> 08:23.586
I could get hit by a bus.
I can't worry about every little thing.

08:23.669 --> 08:26.380
But there are things
you could be doing and should be doing.

08:26.464 --> 08:29.926
Vernon, aren't you overreacting?

08:31.677 --> 08:33.554
Yes, probably.

08:34.597 --> 08:36.265
Come on, come help me.

08:57.995 --> 08:59.330
He still sleeping?

08:59.413 --> 09:01.499
Mm-hm. Poor little lamb.

09:02.875 --> 09:04.752
Did he say anything last night?

09:04.835 --> 09:07.380
He doesn't understand
why Paige isn't back.

09:08.631 --> 09:11.509
-What'd you tell him?
-That she had to fly to Florida for work.

09:12.635 --> 09:15.763
I'm heading back to the cabin.
Hopefully they'll turn up there today.

09:15.846 --> 09:19.308
Preacher, leave this with the sheriff.
It's too dangerous.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.102
No. I'm going.

09:21.769 --> 09:25.815
And when he wakes up, can you take him
back to your house until I get home?

09:25.898 --> 09:27.608
Of course I can.

09:28.109 --> 09:31.028
Listen, I appreciate
everything you've done.

09:31.112 --> 09:32.029
Oh.

09:32.530 --> 09:34.782
Just-- Just remember...

09:34.865 --> 09:36.784
No one will know he's here.

09:36.867 --> 09:37.910
No one.

09:38.494 --> 09:41.706
And you promise me you'll be careful too.

09:42.206 --> 09:43.332
I will.

09:44.542 --> 09:47.086
You tell Christopher
I'll be home as soon as I can.

09:47.169 --> 09:49.171
-I will.
-Okay.

10:19.952 --> 10:21.287
-Hey.
-Oh, hey, Doc.

10:21.370 --> 10:23.372
-Hey.
-Hey, I'm sorry I'm late.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.207
Oh, don't worry about it.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.793
How was your mini getaway?

10:28.544 --> 10:32.840
Oh, actually, Jack surprised me.

10:32.923 --> 10:34.258
Oh, oh!

10:35.009 --> 10:37.386
-Oh, he did good.
-Yeah.

10:37.470 --> 10:40.514
-Congratulations.
-Aw, thank you.

10:40.598 --> 10:43.684
Now, I imagine this news is not a secret?

10:43.768 --> 10:46.270
I feel like the ring
kind of gives it away.

10:46.354 --> 10:48.022
-Precisely.
-Yeah.

10:48.105 --> 10:53.277
Well, being engaged is a very special time
and I hope that you're able to enjoy it.

10:53.361 --> 10:54.195
Thank you.

10:55.905 --> 10:58.240
So how are things going around here?

10:58.324 --> 11:02.745
Oh, they have been
a little rocky, actually.

11:04.205 --> 11:06.040
Cameron has decided to resign.

11:06.123 --> 11:08.709
-What?
-He gave two weeks' notice.

11:08.793 --> 11:11.045
-Came out of nowhere.
-Ugh.

11:11.128 --> 11:13.422
No, no, this is because of me.

11:15.007 --> 11:18.469
When we went to lunch, he said
he didn't think Jack was good for me,

11:18.552 --> 11:20.680
and, you know, things got heated.

11:21.222 --> 11:22.556
That is unfortunate.

11:22.640 --> 11:26.227
I know. You know what? I'll talk to him.
Maybe I can get him to change his mind.

11:26.310 --> 11:28.020
I wouldn't get your hopes up.

11:29.355 --> 11:31.273
He seemed pretty resolved.

11:43.577 --> 11:44.537
Hello?

11:47.540 --> 11:48.791
Hello?

11:48.874 --> 11:49.959
Oh, hi.

11:50.042 --> 11:51.419
Sorry.

11:51.502 --> 11:54.672
Muriel keeps texting me questions
about Ricky's send-off.

11:54.755 --> 11:57.258
We're meeting outside
Connie's at 3:00, right?

11:57.341 --> 11:59.009
Yeah, it's not that hard.

11:59.885 --> 12:01.804
She wants to know what to wear.

12:03.013 --> 12:05.933
Anyway, what would you like?

12:07.518 --> 12:11.355
Twenty-five hours a week,
Monday through Friday, 20 bucks an hour.

12:11.439 --> 12:14.316
Sorry, I don't know
what you're talking about.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.110
I need to hire an aide,

12:16.610 --> 12:21.115
and you did a great job with my plants,
so the job's yours.

12:21.198 --> 12:23.284
Oh. Wow.

12:24.368 --> 12:26.078
So I'd be working at your house?

12:26.162 --> 12:28.539
That's where I am most of the time.

12:29.498 --> 12:32.960
You'd help me grocery shop,
take me to my appointments,

12:33.043 --> 12:35.087
keep track of my medication.

12:35.171 --> 12:36.964
You're not interested.

12:37.047 --> 12:38.632
No, I am, but...

12:39.717 --> 12:43.679
Denny and I kind of had a falling-out,
so it might be awkward.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.681
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't know.

12:45.765 --> 12:49.310
It's okay. But can I think about it?

12:49.393 --> 12:52.062
Of course, you just let me know.

13:02.782 --> 13:05.242
Hey. How are you?

13:05.326 --> 13:08.913
-I thought you were gone for a few days.
-Yeah, I was, but I just got back.

13:09.830 --> 13:10.664
Nice ring.

13:12.082 --> 13:16.003
Oh. Yeah, that's where I was.
It was a total surprise.

13:17.046 --> 13:19.673
Congratulations.
I'm very happy for you guys.

13:19.757 --> 13:20.633
Thanks.

13:21.801 --> 13:26.347
Listen, I talked to Doc,
and he said that you gave notice?

13:27.181 --> 13:30.768
Yeah. I'm gonna go back to San Diego.

13:32.853 --> 13:35.397
-Cameron--
-We don't need to talk about it.

13:35.481 --> 13:37.858
I'm gonna be gone in a few weeks,
and we can just

13:37.942 --> 13:40.611
-leave it at that.
-I'm sorry for the way I reacted.

13:40.694 --> 13:44.365
No, no, no. I was out of line.
You didn't ask for my opinion.

13:44.448 --> 13:46.867
I know, but you thought
you were protecting a friend,

13:46.951 --> 13:48.494
and honestly, I respect that.

13:49.036 --> 13:52.665
I can appreciate you trying to make me
feel better, but sometimes things

13:52.748 --> 13:54.250
can't be unsaid.

13:55.918 --> 13:58.003
It doesn't have to be a big deal.

13:58.087 --> 13:59.463
It is a big deal to me.

14:00.047 --> 14:03.008
I feel like an idiot,
and you've obviously made your decision,

14:03.092 --> 14:06.846
and I can't just all of a sudden
pretend to be supportive.

14:08.222 --> 14:10.558
We don't have to talk
about our personal lives.

14:10.641 --> 14:12.184
I'd still have a front-row seat.

14:14.228 --> 14:15.062
I'm sorry.

14:25.948 --> 14:27.616
In case you need a snack.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.034
Thanks, Grandma.

14:29.118 --> 14:31.996
Jack called. He'll be right on time.

14:32.788 --> 14:35.040
Okay. Do you want me to get your coat?

14:35.666 --> 14:38.669
Actually, I was thinking I'd stay behind.

14:39.545 --> 14:40.796
Oh.

14:41.672 --> 14:44.258
-Do you have your bus ticket?
-Yeah, it's in my backpack.

14:44.758 --> 14:45.843
What about money?

14:45.926 --> 14:48.846
I have 60 bucks and the credit card
you gave me for emergencies.

14:49.346 --> 14:52.641
-Let me see what I have in my wallet.
-No, you don't have to do that.

14:53.225 --> 14:54.310
Oh, here we go.

14:56.645 --> 15:00.107
Buy yourself one of those fancy coffees
when you get to San Diego.

15:06.906 --> 15:08.741
I love you so much.

15:08.824 --> 15:10.034
I love you too.

15:12.620 --> 15:14.955
Okay, so I want you to start

15:15.039 --> 15:17.499
doing those exercises
the physical therapist gave you.

15:17.583 --> 15:20.336
Why? It's not like
I'm gonna start taking aerobics.

15:20.419 --> 15:23.422
It would be nice not to have
to walk with crutches, wouldn't it?

15:23.505 --> 15:25.674
They're a conversation starter
with the ladies.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.927
I don't think you need
any help in that department.

15:29.637 --> 15:31.472
-Thank you.
-You're welcome, Charlie.

15:34.350 --> 15:35.893
-Hey.
-Hey.

15:35.976 --> 15:38.604
-What are you doing here?
-I came by to see the ring.

15:38.687 --> 15:42.066
-Oh.
-Oh, it's gorgeous.

15:42.149 --> 15:45.027
-I did not think he had that in him.
-Yeah.

15:45.110 --> 15:48.030
-It's what I would have picked.
-Have you talked about a date?

15:48.113 --> 15:51.492
No. I think we're gonna enjoy
being engaged for a while.

15:51.575 --> 15:53.285
Okay, I get that. I like it.

15:53.369 --> 15:54.995
-You deserve it.
-Yeah.

15:56.038 --> 15:57.206
Excuse me.

15:58.332 --> 16:00.292
-Yeah.
-What's up with him?

16:01.418 --> 16:02.336
I don't know.

16:02.962 --> 16:05.297
-Yeah, you do.
-I do know. Come outside.

16:09.093 --> 16:11.095
So...

16:12.554 --> 16:15.432
Cameron has decided
to move back to San Diego.

16:15.516 --> 16:16.350
Why?

16:17.601 --> 16:21.647
Well, he told me that he doesn't think

16:21.730 --> 16:24.733
that Jack is the right guy
for me and I got upset.

16:24.817 --> 16:27.820
Wow. Maybe him going back is a good thing,

16:27.903 --> 16:30.489
'cause this office is too small
to be that uncomfortable.

16:31.532 --> 16:33.826
Yeah, it--

16:34.326 --> 16:36.453
It's not really that simple, though.

16:37.830 --> 16:38.831
Um...

16:39.289 --> 16:41.625
I know Jack told you
that I'm pregnant, right?

16:42.501 --> 16:46.964
He told me not to say anything,
but I am so happy for you guys.

16:47.047 --> 16:49.258
Thank you. So am I. Um...

16:49.341 --> 16:52.094
But the-- So the problem is--

16:52.177 --> 16:53.804
Doc is getting older.

16:53.887 --> 16:56.807
And if I can't come to work
because of the pregnancy,

16:56.890 --> 16:59.685
or after the baby's born,
then he's gonna be here alone.

16:59.768 --> 17:02.771
-He's gonna be overwhelmed.
-And have you tried talking to Cameron?

17:03.272 --> 17:06.942
-Yeah. It didn't go well.
-So then there's nothing else you can do.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.694
Hey, ladies.

17:10.237 --> 17:14.158
-Aw. You got me lunch.
-Aw, no!

17:14.241 --> 17:17.536
But I brought you a grilled chicken
focaccia and a side salad.

17:17.619 --> 17:19.788
Aw, thank you, honey, that was very sweet.

17:20.205 --> 17:22.082
Sorry, kid,
I didn't know you were gonna be here.

17:22.166 --> 17:24.418
Oh, no. I just came by to see the ring,
and I'm impressed.

17:24.501 --> 17:26.462
Oh, you keep underestimating me.

17:26.545 --> 17:30.090
Well, my estimations
are based on experience, so...

17:30.174 --> 17:31.216
Oh!

17:31.300 --> 17:34.553
I need to go. See you guys later.
Congratulations again.

17:34.636 --> 17:35.804
-Bye.
-Thanks.

17:37.306 --> 17:40.809
Hello. You came all the way
down here just to give me lunch?

17:40.893 --> 17:44.688
Well, that and Nick came by the bar,
and he wants to take you and I out

17:44.772 --> 17:47.608
to dinner tonight
with Jo Ellen to celebrate.

17:47.691 --> 17:49.526
Oh, that's sweet.

17:49.610 --> 17:54.198
-Um, can we do it another night?
-Why? I don't wanna let him down.

17:54.281 --> 17:56.909
Yeah. I know.
I'm having a tough day at work.

17:56.992 --> 17:58.077
How come?

17:58.869 --> 18:00.120
Cameron is quitting.

18:01.163 --> 18:02.164
Hmm.

18:02.664 --> 18:04.208
What, he get another job?

18:04.708 --> 18:05.542
No.

18:06.043 --> 18:09.421
-So why's he going?
-If I tell you, you're gonna be offended.

18:09.505 --> 18:10.339
Babe.

18:11.173 --> 18:13.467
We're getting married
and we're starting a family.

18:13.550 --> 18:16.553
I couldn't care less
what anybody else says or does.

18:17.554 --> 18:18.972
-So, what happened?
-Ugh.

18:19.598 --> 18:23.352
Cameron said he thinks you're unreliable.

18:25.979 --> 18:28.273
What, because I didn't show up
to the wedding?

18:28.357 --> 18:30.442
Yeah. And I told him he was wrong,

18:30.526 --> 18:33.570
and now he feels uncomfortable
working together.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.491
I guess he's entitled to his opinion.

18:38.450 --> 18:40.494
Okay, fine.
I'll cancel dinner, don't worry.

18:40.577 --> 18:42.996
Oh, honey. No, don't do that.

18:43.080 --> 18:48.043
No, it's okay. I'll be fine. I don't
wanna disappoint Nick and Jo Ellen.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.294
-You sure?
-Yeah.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.674
You're the most compassionate
human being that I've ever met.

18:53.757 --> 18:55.425
-Do you know that?
-Oh, please.

18:55.509 --> 18:58.637
If I didn't have to go pick up Ricky,
I would steal you away.

18:58.720 --> 18:59.596
Would you?

18:59.680 --> 19:02.307
-Well, you can steal me another time.
-Oh, I'm gonna.

19:02.391 --> 19:04.518
-I'll see you at Connie's.
-Okay.

19:04.601 --> 19:06.145
-I love you.
-Love you too.

19:17.239 --> 19:20.868
-What's he doing here?
-No idea, but he ain't staying.

19:20.951 --> 19:23.245
Why don't you go in the house
and grab a beer, huh?

19:28.417 --> 19:29.293
What now?

19:30.586 --> 19:31.920
You're a free man.

19:33.255 --> 19:35.174
-What?
-Turns out Deputy Howard

19:35.257 --> 19:38.135
-was helping Calvin launder money.
-How did you figure that out?

19:38.760 --> 19:39.761
Brie.

19:41.221 --> 19:42.055
She, uh...

19:42.639 --> 19:46.226
She got a lead from a DEA friend of hers
and followed the money,

19:46.310 --> 19:49.313
which led to an address
receiving checks made to cash.

19:49.396 --> 19:53.734
I went to check it out and when
I got there, Howard was at the house.

19:53.817 --> 19:57.905
Pulled a gun on me, but I got
the jump on him and cuffed him.

19:57.988 --> 20:00.657
It's a riveting story,
but what's that got to do with me?

20:00.741 --> 20:01.867
He made a deal.

20:02.576 --> 20:05.913
He admitted to planting
the gun in your truck.

20:09.750 --> 20:13.712
Listen, I'm really sorry, Brady, I--

20:16.173 --> 20:18.717
I was just following the evidence.

20:24.973 --> 20:25.807
That it?

20:27.142 --> 20:28.352
Case closed?

20:29.394 --> 20:33.232
Yeah, the DEA officially
dropped the charges, filed the paperwork.

20:33.315 --> 20:34.650
You are in the clear.

20:37.486 --> 20:41.073
I figured you'd want to tell Brie.

20:59.299 --> 21:00.300
Hey, Preach, it's me.

21:01.426 --> 21:04.054
I haven't heard from you, man.
I hope everything's okay.

21:04.137 --> 21:05.305
Just give me a call back.

21:07.849 --> 21:09.810
I'll call you
when I get to the MCRD, okay?

21:16.108 --> 21:19.152
-Lydie, you're not coming?
-No, we've said our goodbyes.

21:19.236 --> 21:22.239
But thank you
for taking him to the station.

21:22.322 --> 21:23.156
Pleasure.

22:10.954 --> 22:13.623
So you looking forward
to wearing shorts in December?

22:14.124 --> 22:14.958
What?

22:15.625 --> 22:18.628
San Diego winters
are a heck of a lot warmer than up here.

22:20.005 --> 22:21.006
Actually, I'm...

22:21.840 --> 22:25.635
thinking more about what
I'm leaving behind than where I'm going.

22:25.719 --> 22:26.970
You worried about Lydie?

22:27.679 --> 22:28.513
Yeah.

22:29.473 --> 22:30.807
But not just her.

22:33.852 --> 22:37.314
Yeah, it's tough leaving someone
you love behind.

22:38.357 --> 22:39.858
Sometimes a little distance

22:39.941 --> 22:42.027
can make someone realize
what they're missing.

22:43.403 --> 22:47.032
-Aren't we supposed to be on the highway?
-Yeah, we got a little detour.

22:54.247 --> 22:56.416
Wait, is this all for me?

22:57.167 --> 22:58.460
It's your name on the signs.

22:59.544 --> 23:00.545
By the way...

23:01.671 --> 23:03.131
Lizzie organized all of this.

23:04.966 --> 23:06.301
All right! Oh, my God.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.011
Wow! This is so--

23:08.095 --> 23:09.221
-Hey.
-Let's go, Ricky!

23:09.304 --> 23:10.138
Hey.

23:12.682 --> 23:14.518
-I'll miss you.
-Miss you too.

23:14.601 --> 23:17.687
-Come here.
-Look at ours first.

23:17.771 --> 23:19.272
Yours is the best one.

23:20.774 --> 23:22.484
Oh, that's adorable.

23:24.277 --> 23:26.238
-Hey.
-Hey.

23:26.321 --> 23:29.032
-Didn't I just see you?
-Are you bored already?

23:29.116 --> 23:30.659
No, never.

23:33.995 --> 23:36.665
-Oh, do you mind if I take this?
-Yeah, go ahead.

23:40.127 --> 23:41.002
Hey, Char.

23:42.129 --> 23:44.589
Hey, hey, hey, calm down, take a breath.

23:45.757 --> 23:47.801
It's amazing. It's gorgeous.

23:49.511 --> 23:53.390
Look, I'm sure it's probably
just a business dinner.

23:53.473 --> 23:54.975
Have you had a chance to ask him?

23:56.935 --> 23:59.855
Okay, well, I gotta get Ricky
to the bus station,

23:59.938 --> 24:01.481
but I'll call you on my way back.

24:03.316 --> 24:06.736
Okay. Well, in the meantime,
just try to stay calm.

24:06.820 --> 24:08.447
Everything's gonna be fine, okay?

24:10.073 --> 24:10.907
Okay.

24:12.159 --> 24:13.952
Hey. Is everything okay?

24:14.744 --> 24:16.079
Yeah, Charmaine's freaked out

24:16.163 --> 24:18.790
because she found a hotel bar charge
on Todd's credit card.

24:18.874 --> 24:21.543
Oh, well, that doesn't mean
he's cheating on her.

24:21.626 --> 24:24.004
I know, but she's sensitive about that.

24:24.087 --> 24:26.548
I don't think
she has anyone else to talk to.

24:27.257 --> 24:30.260
Oh. That must be such
a lonely place to be in.

24:30.343 --> 24:32.012
Yeah. I feel bad for her.

24:32.095 --> 24:34.055
Well, you're being a good friend.

24:34.556 --> 24:36.475
-Well, you'd do the same.
-Yeah.

24:43.440 --> 24:44.357
Okay, bye, guys.

24:45.317 --> 24:46.151
Hi.

24:47.777 --> 24:50.155
So I guess this is it, huh?

24:51.531 --> 24:53.158
Yeah. I guess so.

24:54.868 --> 24:57.954
Thank you for organizing all this.

24:58.580 --> 25:00.624
It was-- It was amazing.

25:00.707 --> 25:02.876
Well, I couldn't let you leave
without making a scene.

25:02.959 --> 25:03.793
Hmm.

25:05.337 --> 25:06.171
Well...

25:07.589 --> 25:08.715
See you later, then.

25:09.674 --> 25:11.301
Be careful, dummy.

25:17.057 --> 25:20.060
-Hey, bud. We gotta go.
-Okay.

25:20.936 --> 25:21.770
Bye.

25:23.688 --> 25:25.106
All right, guys.

25:25.190 --> 25:26.816
-Duty calls.
-Bye, Ricky!

25:26.900 --> 25:27.734
Goodbye.

25:29.027 --> 25:29.945
Bye-bye.

25:32.906 --> 25:33.907
Ricky!

25:41.581 --> 25:43.083
Goodbye, Ricky.

25:46.586 --> 25:47.754
Bye.

25:53.426 --> 25:54.427
Bye-bye!

26:09.526 --> 26:10.610
You ready?

26:11.278 --> 26:12.946
No, but...

26:14.030 --> 26:15.532
I'm gonna get on that bus anyway.

26:16.658 --> 26:17.492
Thank you.

26:21.705 --> 26:23.206
I'm so proud of you.

26:23.290 --> 26:25.333
Yeah. Thanks. I'm just...

26:26.626 --> 26:27.752
really stressed out.

26:28.962 --> 26:30.297
I feel like a coward.

26:31.339 --> 26:33.008
You're preparing for battle.

26:33.842 --> 26:36.261
Any sane person would feel the same way.

26:37.804 --> 26:40.015
-Did you?
-Heck yeah.

26:40.098 --> 26:41.349
Big time.

26:41.433 --> 26:44.019
But I never let fear
stop me from living my life.

26:45.353 --> 26:46.521
Listen, Ricky...

26:48.189 --> 26:49.399
I believe in you.

26:50.400 --> 26:51.234
Okay?

26:52.277 --> 26:55.447
And so does everyone else in town,
so if you ever need anything,

26:55.530 --> 26:57.699
we're here for you, always.

27:00.118 --> 27:00.994
Thanks, Jack.

27:02.203 --> 27:03.163
I love you.

27:03.246 --> 27:05.540
Oh, I love you too, buddy.

27:55.465 --> 27:59.177
-I can't see anything.

28:00.011 --> 28:01.346
Look in this one, then.

28:02.931 --> 28:05.600
Lydie? I used my key.

28:06.476 --> 28:08.144
What are you all doing here?

28:08.937 --> 28:10.605
We were worried.

28:10.689 --> 28:13.483
Why didn't you go with Jack
and Ricky to the bus station?

28:13.566 --> 28:16.236
I have things to do around here.

28:16.319 --> 28:19.239
Lydie. We know that's not the reason.

28:21.825 --> 28:25.620
I just can't stop crying,
and if Ricky had seen me like this,

28:25.704 --> 28:28.081
he never would've gotten on the bus.

28:29.624 --> 28:35.547
This is the first time that
I have lived alone in a very long time.

28:37.590 --> 28:40.301
And I miss him. I miss him already.

28:42.429 --> 28:44.556
-What I am gonna do without my Ricky?
-Shh.

28:44.639 --> 28:48.351
Whenever you get lonely, you're gonna call
one of us to come over and be with you.

28:49.561 --> 28:52.063
-You all have lives.
-Muriel doesn't.

28:53.982 --> 28:55.275
Hope's right, though.

28:55.817 --> 28:57.736
We will be here for you anytime.

28:57.819 --> 28:59.112
Day or night.

29:00.655 --> 29:03.408
We're here for each other.
That's what we do.

29:22.218 --> 29:23.052
Let's go.

29:40.278 --> 29:41.279
<i>Hey, man.</i>

29:41.362 --> 29:45.158
I found Vince. He's got Paige
and he's armed, so I might need a hand.

29:45.241 --> 29:46.951
Where are you?

29:47.035 --> 29:50.497
<i>I sent coordinates to a cabin</i>
<i>in Trinity County. I need you here, quick.</i>

29:50.580 --> 29:52.040
But no backup.

29:52.916 --> 29:54.083
Just you.

29:54.167 --> 29:58.671
Preacher, whatever you're thinking, don't.
I'm in Eureka, but I'll get there.

29:58.755 --> 30:01.216
I'm on the perimeter,
east side of the front door.

30:01.299 --> 30:03.843
<i>Now, you won't see me, but I'll see you.</i>

30:03.927 --> 30:05.553
And, Mike, listen.

30:07.680 --> 30:10.975
If he hears you,
he may panic and pull the trigger.

30:17.774 --> 30:18.650
I'll get it.

30:22.904 --> 30:24.447
Hey. Is Doc home?

30:24.531 --> 30:26.199
-Yeah, come in.
-Thanks.

30:27.534 --> 30:29.077
-Hey.
-Hey.

30:29.160 --> 30:31.162
I'm gonna make some hot chocolate.
Want some?

30:31.246 --> 30:34.374
-I'm okay. Thank you.
-I'll take a cup. Thanks.

30:35.834 --> 30:37.752
Uh, can I talk to you for a sec?

30:37.836 --> 30:39.879
Sure. Sure. Um...

30:39.963 --> 30:43.341
Actually, I wanted to ask you
something, but you go first.

30:43.424 --> 30:45.426
Oh, no, that's okay. You go first.

30:45.510 --> 30:46.803
It is about Hope.

30:46.886 --> 30:50.890
As you know, her neurologist
wants her to hire a home health aide,

30:50.974 --> 30:52.600
and she offered the job to Lizzie.

30:52.684 --> 30:54.018
Oh, that's a good idea.

30:54.102 --> 30:57.105
Yeah, except I don't think
it's gonna work out.

30:57.188 --> 31:00.733
Apparently, Lizzie and Denny
had a falling-out.

31:00.817 --> 31:04.612
And Lizzie is--
She said she would consider the position,

31:04.696 --> 31:07.198
but Hope doesn't think
she's gonna take it.

31:07.282 --> 31:09.784
-Have you talked to Denny about it?
-No.

31:09.868 --> 31:13.371
Hope and I, we both agreed,
we don't wanna pressure him.

31:13.454 --> 31:14.789
And Hope is--

31:14.873 --> 31:17.750
-She's too proud to ask her friends.
-Mm-hm.

31:17.834 --> 31:20.920
So I just wondered
if you had some suggestions.

31:21.504 --> 31:24.716
Well, hospitals usually have referrals,

31:24.799 --> 31:29.137
but you know what, I'm happy to fill in
until you find somebody permanent.

31:29.888 --> 31:33.892
Well, that is mighty generous of you.
Let me talk to Hope about that.

31:33.975 --> 31:35.184
Yeah, sure.

31:35.268 --> 31:37.896
So, what'd you wanna speak to me about?

31:39.147 --> 31:41.399
Uh, well, you were right.

31:41.482 --> 31:44.319
Cameron is set on leaving.

31:44.402 --> 31:46.779
We will be just fine without him.

31:48.364 --> 31:49.407
You know what?

31:51.117 --> 31:53.077
I know that you're well aware...

31:54.412 --> 31:58.166
but as a high-risk pregnancy,
I could end up on bedrest.

31:58.249 --> 31:59.459
The baby could come early.

31:59.542 --> 32:01.669
We will cross that bridge
when we come to it.

32:01.753 --> 32:06.215
I know, but by the time that happens,
you'll end up doing all the work.

32:06.299 --> 32:10.678
Which, if I may remind you,
I was happily doing before you arrived.

32:10.762 --> 32:12.931
I know that, but you have to admit

32:13.014 --> 32:15.058
that it's been a lot easier
with two doctors.

32:15.141 --> 32:19.646
I mean, you know, you're able
to spend more time with Hope and Denny,

32:19.729 --> 32:21.689
and they both really need you.

32:21.773 --> 32:23.483
What are you telling me?

32:23.566 --> 32:28.029
Maybe if I leave, then Cameron will stay
and you won't have to hire a replacement.

32:29.113 --> 32:31.407
What do you mean, if you leave?

32:31.908 --> 32:35.286
Look, I only wanna do what's best for you.

32:38.122 --> 32:39.666
So I've decided to resign.

32:43.795 --> 32:45.338
That looks really good.

32:49.342 --> 32:50.510
Go head upstairs.

32:59.268 --> 33:02.438
-Hey. Can we talk?
-I'm kind of busy right now.

33:02.522 --> 33:03.606
Please.

33:09.529 --> 33:12.323
-What's up?
-I wanted to ask you about Hope.

33:12.407 --> 33:15.076
She offered you a job
and you said you needed to think about it.

33:15.159 --> 33:17.620
-Yeah.
-Are you hesitating 'cause of me?

33:18.413 --> 33:21.416
I can't be around you.
I feel stupid for wanting more.

33:21.499 --> 33:25.044
Lizzie, my reason for not wanting to
get involved has nothing to do with you.

33:25.128 --> 33:27.338
And I don't believe you. Sorry.

33:28.131 --> 33:30.216
No, I don't wanna hurt you.

33:31.217 --> 33:33.261
Okay? That's the whole point
of all of this.

33:33.344 --> 33:36.014
If it's a big deal to Hope,
I'll take the job.

33:36.097 --> 33:39.642
But I think you've been stringing me along
and you're not gonna change my mind.

33:44.022 --> 33:44.856
Lizzie.

33:46.774 --> 33:49.861
The reason I can't be
in a relationship is because...

33:50.361 --> 33:51.696
I don't have a future.

33:54.282 --> 33:55.867
I have Huntington's disease...

33:56.993 --> 33:58.411
which is terminal.

34:03.708 --> 34:04.959
What can I get for you?

34:05.043 --> 34:08.629
We'd like to start off
with your nicest bottle of champagne.

34:08.713 --> 34:11.883
-We're celebrating an engagement.
-Certainly. Be right back.

34:11.966 --> 34:14.510
So do you know
what kind of wedding you'll be having?

34:14.594 --> 34:18.431
Um, you know what,
we haven't talked about that yet.

34:18.514 --> 34:21.392
I wouldn't mind it feeling like a party.

34:22.018 --> 34:24.228
It'll be a party here in a minute.

34:24.312 --> 34:26.981
My sister's in town,
and she's gotta leave a day early,

34:27.065 --> 34:28.649
so I invited her to join us.

34:28.733 --> 34:30.943
I hope you guys don't mind.

34:31.027 --> 34:32.612
Sure. The more the merrier, right?

34:32.695 --> 34:34.155
Oh, here she is.

34:34.238 --> 34:37.658
Jack, Mel, this is my sister,
Melissa Montgomery.

34:38.659 --> 34:39.494
Hello.

34:39.577 --> 34:41.662
-Jack Sheridan.
-Nice to meet you.

34:41.746 --> 34:43.372
-Good to meet you.
-Hi there. Mel.

35:06.020 --> 35:07.772
Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

35:08.481 --> 35:09.649
What are you doing here?

35:09.732 --> 35:10.983
Been trying to reach you.

35:11.651 --> 35:12.985
-Why?
-Let's just--

35:13.069 --> 35:14.612
-No, there's nothing to say.
-Hey--

35:14.695 --> 35:15.988
Don't!

35:16.572 --> 35:18.783
I'm not trying to cause problems.

35:18.866 --> 35:20.868
I just need you to sign something.

35:31.212 --> 35:33.339
You want me to sign
a nondisclosure agreement?

35:33.422 --> 35:34.799
It protects both of us.

35:35.508 --> 35:39.303
Says we agree not to discuss
our relationship with a third party.

35:39.387 --> 35:41.514
I'm not signing anything.

35:41.597 --> 35:43.432
Why are you being such a bitch?

35:45.935 --> 35:47.353
Say that again.

35:47.436 --> 35:51.149
Sign it and I'll leave you alone,
you'll never have to see me again.

35:51.232 --> 35:53.651
All you care about is yourself.

35:54.318 --> 35:55.820
You know, I quit my job.

35:56.529 --> 35:58.573
I had to move out of town.

35:59.574 --> 36:00.533
I lost...

36:02.326 --> 36:03.619
so much.

36:04.912 --> 36:06.831
But nothing changed for you, did it?

36:07.498 --> 36:10.960
Look, I'm sorry
if I did something to upset you.

36:11.836 --> 36:12.920
Upset me?

36:16.924 --> 36:18.134
You raped me.

36:20.887 --> 36:23.472
And you're the one
who should have suffered.

36:24.765 --> 36:27.393
But you know what,
for all the other women in your life...

36:29.061 --> 36:30.479
I can't let that stand.

36:31.689 --> 36:32.607
What's that mean?

36:32.690 --> 36:34.942
I'm gonna do
what I wish I had done that night.

36:35.026 --> 36:38.988
I'm gonna file a police report
and I'm gonna press charges.

36:39.071 --> 36:42.200
Well, good luck with that.
No one's gonna believe you.

36:42.283 --> 36:44.243
Yeah. Well, we'll see about that.

36:44.744 --> 36:46.454
But if I were you, I would lawyer up.

36:46.996 --> 36:47.830
Asshole.

36:57.381 --> 36:59.467
Mel, you haven't touched a drop.

36:59.550 --> 37:02.303
You know what,
it's kind of hard on my stomach.

37:02.386 --> 37:03.888
That or you're pregnant.

37:06.766 --> 37:07.808
Are you?

37:09.185 --> 37:10.144
Um...

37:12.480 --> 37:13.731
-Yes, we are.
-Yeah.

37:13.814 --> 37:14.732
Oh!

37:16.067 --> 37:18.611
-That is so good!
-Wow, then double congratulations.

37:18.694 --> 37:20.238
Thanks. We just found out.

37:20.321 --> 37:23.282
We've gotta toast. Everybody grab a glass.

37:24.075 --> 37:25.576
-Of course.
-Cheers.

37:25.660 --> 37:26.619
Cheers!

37:26.702 --> 37:29.288
-Congratulations, guys.
-Thank you.

37:30.289 --> 37:31.749
Oh, that is fantastic.

37:36.712 --> 37:38.339
Oh, shoot. Hey.

37:39.465 --> 37:42.301
Something is wrong with Charmaine,
I gotta get over there.

37:42.385 --> 37:44.512
-Oh, okay, I'll come with you.
-Okay.

37:44.595 --> 37:46.514
-Okay.
-Guys, I'm so sorry.

37:46.597 --> 37:48.140
We have a little emergency.

37:48.224 --> 37:49.225
Oh, dear.

37:49.308 --> 37:51.394
Yeah, sorry. Thank you so much.

37:51.477 --> 37:52.395
You're welcome.

37:52.478 --> 37:54.897
Don't worry. I hope everything's okay.

37:54.981 --> 37:56.399
Yeah. Thanks. Thanks.

37:56.482 --> 37:58.317
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

37:58.401 --> 37:59.610
-Good night.
-Thanks again.

38:06.033 --> 38:08.452
-I'm so sick of your lies.
-I'm not lying, Vince.

38:11.247 --> 38:14.875
You tell me what happened to Wes,
or I'm gonna put a bullet in your head!

38:16.711 --> 38:19.130
-Preacher.
-Get rid of the gun.

38:19.213 --> 38:21.382
-Let her go.
-Get rid of it.

38:27.471 --> 38:30.182
She's gonna pay
for what she did to my brother.

38:30.266 --> 38:31.976
She didn't mean to kill your brother.

38:33.102 --> 38:34.937
Just like you didn't mean to shoot Jack.

38:35.688 --> 38:38.065
Yeah, that was your fault.

38:39.191 --> 38:40.776
I'm looking for Preacher.

38:40.860 --> 38:43.571
He's playing poker
with the sheriff tonight,

38:43.654 --> 38:46.198
but I'll call him,
let him know you're here.

38:47.074 --> 38:48.159
I wouldn't.

39:16.228 --> 39:20.024
You tell me where you buried Wes,
or I'm gonna bury your son.

39:20.107 --> 39:21.734
She doesn't know.

39:22.985 --> 39:23.861
Bull.

39:23.944 --> 39:26.113
I'm the one that buried your brother.

39:29.158 --> 39:30.409
Go!

40:00.231 --> 40:01.190
I'll shoot you.

40:02.942 --> 40:04.151
No, you won't.

40:34.098 --> 40:34.932
Char!

40:36.559 --> 40:37.393
Charmaine?

40:39.603 --> 40:40.938
Char, are you in here?

40:42.273 --> 40:43.107
Char?

40:43.816 --> 40:45.317
Oh, my God. Charmaine.

40:47.445 --> 40:50.281
Hey. Oh, let's sit up. Here we go.

40:51.449 --> 40:52.825
Okay.

40:52.908 --> 40:53.951
I can't breathe.

40:54.034 --> 40:56.537
Try to take some breaths.
Can you call 911?

40:57.746 --> 40:59.582
Try to breathe a little deeper.

40:59.665 --> 41:01.208
Let me check your pulse.

41:02.251 --> 41:04.503
Hi, a friend of mine
is having trouble breathing.

41:04.587 --> 41:07.548
She's about five months pregnant
with twins.

41:07.631 --> 41:09.216
We're gonna take care of you, okay?

41:10.092 --> 41:12.595
He's-- He's gonna leave me.

41:12.678 --> 41:14.346
-Who's leaving you?
-Todd!

41:14.430 --> 41:15.639
Oh, no, honey.

41:16.390 --> 41:17.224
Please, hurry.

41:20.394 --> 41:22.897
-Just breathe.
-Ambulance is on its way.

41:22.980 --> 41:27.151
-I'm gonna lose my babies.
-No, you're not gonna lose your babies.

41:27.234 --> 41:29.320
Okay? The ambulance is coming.

41:30.654 --> 41:33.282
This is karma. I'm being punished.

41:33.365 --> 41:36.911
No, you're not being punished.
I need you to focus, okay?

41:36.994 --> 41:39.788
-You need to breathe.
-It's because I lied.

41:39.872 --> 41:40.748
What?

41:42.833 --> 41:43.834
The twins.

41:46.003 --> 41:47.922
They're not your babies.
