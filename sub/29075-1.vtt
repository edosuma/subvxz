Hey, it's startin'

04:15.963 --> 04:18.798

longer she's gonna hold!

04:18.801 --> 04:20.233
Don't

Shit.

04:40.988 --> 04:42.489
Hey, we got methane.

04:42.491 --> 04:44.157
Tell Johnny to shut

04:44.159 --> 04:46.126
All hands makin' a
wind curtain, let's go.

04:47.830 --> 04:49.562

04:51.033 --> 04:52.299
The man trip is down.

04:56.437 --> 04:58.004

- I don't know.

04:58.006 --> 04:58.872
The damn thing won't go.

04:58.874 --> 05:00.006
We ain't got time.

05:00.008 --> 05:01.074
Let's go, come on.

05:01.076 --> 05:02.341

- Tack it.

05:02.343 --> 05:03.375
- Look over there.

05:03.377 --> 05:04.310
- Pull it tight.

05:04.312 --> 05:05.512

05:05.514 --> 05:06.947

05:06.949 --> 05:08.148
Go, go, go,

05:08.150 --> 05:08.949

05:10.018 --> 05:11.250

05:17.158 --> 05:19.394
Do it from inside.

05:22.163 --> 05:23.997
All right.

05:23.999 --> 05:25.098
All right, you
taut, everybody good?

05:27.302 --> 05:29.069
All right, nice job, fellas.

05:48.590 --> 05:50.055
We good?

05:50.057 --> 05:52.024
Ah, our Father.

05:52.026 --> 05:54.127
Air velocity is...

05:54.129 --> 05:55.362
- Lord in heaven.
- Now it's comin' up.

05:55.364 --> 05:56.930
Hallowed be thy name.

05:56.932 --> 05:58.098
Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done

05:58.100 --> 05:59.199
on Earth as it is in heaven.

05:59.201 --> 06:00.165
- Good job, John, good job.
- Hallowed be thy name.

06:00.167 --> 06:02.201
Thy kingdom, Earth.

06:02.203 --> 06:06.072
Give us this daily bread and
forgive us our trespasses

06:06.074 --> 06:07.607
as we forgive those who trespass

06:07.609 --> 06:08.908
against us.

06:08.910 --> 06:10.242
Lead us not into temptation.

06:10.244 --> 06:11.610
For thine is the power

06:11.612 --> 06:16.552
and the glory forever, amen.

06:18.287 --> 06:22.225
It's all good.

06:30.999 --> 06:32.499
Boys, we're sittin'
here talkin' in circles.

06:32.501 --> 06:34.567
Ain't none of us really
come up with somethin'.

06:34.569 --> 06:36.036
We gotta figure it out.

06:36.038 --> 06:37.405
Well I say we go.

06:39.074 --> 06:42.041
It ain't nothin' but free
heat's the way I look at it.

06:42.043 --> 06:43.076
And I don't give a good goddamn

06:43.078 --> 06:44.576
what my brother
finds down there.

06:44.578 --> 06:46.112
Excuse me, John.

06:46.114 --> 06:47.213
Yeah.

06:47.215 --> 06:49.382
Paycheck's more important
than gettin' shut down.

06:49.384 --> 06:52.218
Well we all need to put
food on our table, ya know?

06:52.220 --> 06:54.086
My family needs me
to work, ya know?

06:54.088 --> 06:54.923
We all do.

06:58.160 --> 07:00.392
Paycheck ain't gon'
mean shit if you die

07:00.394 --> 07:02.264
two miles in, Kenny.

07:04.499 --> 07:06.232
Now we are filled
up with more methane

07:06.234 --> 07:09.101
than any other
mine in this area.

07:09.103 --> 07:11.504
If you call MSHA
and they come down

07:11.506 --> 07:13.740
and go down in
that fuckin' mine,

07:13.742 --> 07:16.175
they gon' shut us
down methane or not.

07:16.177 --> 07:18.144
And what's he gonna do?

07:18.146 --> 07:19.512
Smitty, what are you gon' do?

07:19.514 --> 07:20.547
Tiny, what are you gon' do?

07:20.549 --> 07:22.081
There ain't no fuckin' thing

07:22.083 --> 07:23.149
- to do around here!
- That mine is a bomb, Kenny!

07:23.151 --> 07:26.485
And we are all sittin'
right in the middle of it!

07:26.487 --> 07:28.221
God's gonna protect us, hm?

07:28.223 --> 07:31.559
God will not protect
us in Hell, John.

07:34.028 --> 07:38.298
Now you've all seen
it, shift after shift.

07:38.300 --> 07:42.267
It's gettin' worse and
worse, bigger and bigger.

07:42.269 --> 07:44.704
Zeke, if I die down
below my family's

07:44.706 --> 07:46.605
gonna get insurance.

07:46.607 --> 07:48.608
Me up here without a job?

07:48.610 --> 07:50.679
Hell, man, I'm worthless.

07:54.148 --> 07:56.149
Well, fellas, the
sump pump in the section

07:56.151 --> 07:58.254
can't keep up, all right?

07:59.453 --> 08:01.021
And when it fails
we're gon' drown.

08:01.023 --> 08:02.254
You wanna add that to the list?

08:02.256 --> 08:05.124
You wanna add that
to the raft of shit!

08:05.126 --> 08:08.093
I ain't blowed up or
drowned in 15 years.

08:08.095 --> 08:10.163
Now I ain't scared, I ain't
tellin' y'all what to be.

08:10.165 --> 08:13.102
What kinda fuckin'
logic is that?

08:14.268 --> 08:18.173
Now all in favor of
diggin' some coal, say aye.

08:22.511 --> 08:24.177
Aye.

08:24.179 --> 08:25.014
Aye.

08:26.614 --> 08:27.579

08:27.581 --> 08:28.416

08:36.691 --> 08:37.525
Aye.

08:38.525 --> 08:39.361
Aye.

08:42.063 --> 08:42.698
Settled.

08:46.201 --> 08:50.338
Kenny, Ryan shouldn't be
goin' down there with us.

08:52.239 --> 08:53.372
You fellas have a nice night.

08:53.374 --> 08:55.475
What my boy does is none
of your goddamn business,

08:55.477 --> 08:56.642
big brother.

08:56.644 --> 08:57.610
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

08:57.612 --> 08:59.215
- Easy.

09:01.115 --> 09:02.815

09:02.817 --> 09:04.350
We voted, all right?

09:04.352 --> 09:06.086
We're goin' back to work.

09:06.088 --> 09:08.254
We're gonna put some food
on our tables, all right?

09:08.256 --> 09:10.589
I say we go down, we
get us a few drinks,

09:10.591 --> 09:13.325
and since John don't
drink, you're buyin', boy.

09:13.327 --> 09:14.426
All right, what do

09:14.428 --> 09:15.561

- Ha!

09:15.563 --> 09:16.628
You wanna go.

09:16.630 --> 09:17.863
Come on, Shitty.

09:17.865 --> 09:19.565

Hey, church lady,
I'm sorry I'm late.

12:14.475 --> 12:15.842
How was the service?

12:15.844 --> 12:16.675
Was good.

12:16.677 --> 12:17.977
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

12:17.979 --> 12:19.444
You're gonna get

12:19.446 --> 12:20.545
I'm not gonna get
coal all over me.

12:21.483 --> 12:22.648
Pastor was askin' about
you again, though.

12:22.650 --> 12:23.483
Oh was he?

12:23.485 --> 12:24.751
Mm-hmm.

12:24.753 --> 12:28.554
Askin' after my soul
or another donation?

12:28.556 --> 12:29.655
Be nice.

12:29.657 --> 12:32.025
Ya know, I wish you'd
let me take this thing off.

12:32.027 --> 12:33.593
All right, honey.

12:33.595 --> 12:35.060
- You're one to talk.
- In another life.

12:35.062 --> 12:36.762
Now go, say hi.

12:36.764 --> 12:38.430
Say hello.

12:38.432 --> 12:39.498
Yes, ma'am.

12:41.536 --> 12:43.603
You wanna be a miner?

12:43.605 --> 12:45.438
Eh, ya know what, why
don't you study in school

12:45.440 --> 12:46.705
and see how good
you can do there?

12:46.707 --> 12:47.973
How's that?

12:47.975 --> 12:49.608
Hey, get outta here,
go enjoy your party.

12:49.610 --> 12:53.478
Your party.

12:53.480 --> 12:55.781
Rather see that boy in a
football helmet than a hardhat.

12:55.783 --> 12:57.516
Yeah, I agree.

12:57.518 --> 12:59.919
Mornin', Uncle Zeke.

12:59.921 --> 13:01.387
None of that Uncle Zeke stuff

13:01.389 --> 13:02.521
when we're in the
mine, understood?

13:02.523 --> 13:04.357
Yes, sir, yeah.

13:04.359 --> 13:05.090
First day
underground is not like

13:05.092 --> 13:06.492
your first day in kindergarten.

13:06.494 --> 13:09.494
I hope those boots
are waterproof.

13:09.496 --> 13:10.997
That mine goes a hell of
a lot deeper underground

13:10.999 --> 13:13.031
than the water table is.

13:13.033 --> 13:15.638
What's the water table again?

13:17.471 --> 13:20.806
It is the lowest point
to where the water sits.

13:20.808 --> 13:21.773
It's geology.

13:21.775 --> 13:23.508
- On me, me.
- Okay.

13:23.510 --> 13:25.411
Look, the stream is
no more than 60 feet deep.

13:25.413 --> 13:27.579
Rivers, lakes, wells,
no more 'n 200 feet.

13:27.581 --> 13:30.550
We are cuttin' coal
2,000 feet deep.

13:30.552 --> 13:32.617
We take on water, that's
just the way it is.

13:32.619 --> 13:34.920
Okay, I'm so confused.

13:34.922 --> 13:36.555
I told him all that.

13:36.557 --> 13:38.657
I told you three,
four times already.

13:38.659 --> 13:40.892
Hey,
hey, hey, come on.

13:40.894 --> 13:43.628
I don't wanna hear none of
that holier than thou bullshit.

13:43.630 --> 13:45.765
Now don't you make an ass
outta me down there today.

13:45.767 --> 13:46.866
'Cause I don't even
wanna be here right now

13:46.868 --> 13:47.867
- with you, huh?
- Boy.

13:47.869 --> 13:49.035
I'm tired of your shit.

13:49.037 --> 13:49.835
- I pay for your pillow!
- I'm tired of you

13:49.837 --> 13:50.803
touchin' me, I'm tired

13:50.805 --> 13:51.737
- of your shit.
- Hey, hey, hey.

13:51.739 --> 13:52.704
Hey, you get back here, boy.

13:52.706 --> 13:53.542
Boy!

13:55.877 --> 13:58.478
Hey, 18 all right?

13:58.480 --> 13:59.545
All right?

13:59.547 --> 14:00.479
He is 18.

14:00.481 --> 14:02.547
We was both in the
fuckin' war at 18, John.

14:02.549 --> 14:03.882
I know that, Kenny.

14:03.884 --> 14:04.916
Now he's just a boy,
and he's got a bit

14:04.918 --> 14:06.618
of your blood in him.

14:06.620 --> 14:07.755
Now go sit down.

14:11.826 --> 14:12.992
What'd I tell
you about drinkin'

14:12.994 --> 14:15.093
before your shift, Kenny, huh?

14:15.095 --> 14:16.764
What did I tell you?

14:22.470 --> 14:23.603
- Stop!
- Go home.

14:23.605 --> 14:24.773
- Ryan!
- What?

14:25.672 --> 14:27.172
You don't have to do this.

14:27.174 --> 14:29.074
Listen, my dad ain't like
your parents, Missy, all right?

14:29.076 --> 14:30.877
What don't you
understand about this?

14:30.879 --> 14:32.145
I don't have time to sit

14:32.147 --> 14:33.612
in this damn town
and wait for you.

14:33.614 --> 14:35.915
And I'm not able
to go with you.

14:35.917 --> 14:39.021
I don't even have
gas money, ya know?

14:41.889 --> 14:44.058
Happy birthday, Russell.

14:45.427 --> 14:46.726
What do you say, Russell?

14:46.728 --> 14:47.730
Thank you.

14:48.863 --> 14:49.698
Grace.

14:52.600 --> 14:53.435
Hi, Susie.

14:54.168 --> 14:55.002
Hi.

14:56.937 --> 14:59.704
Did you get the call
about the reunion?

14:59.706 --> 15:00.742
Yeah.

15:03.445 --> 15:04.776
Are ya goin'?

15:04.778 --> 15:06.612
You have a good day, Teresa.

15:06.614 --> 15:07.612
Hey, Russell.

15:07.614 --> 15:08.446
And I hope you and Salvia

15:08.448 --> 15:11.519
are takin' good
care of my husband.

15:12.619 --> 15:13.755
Have a good day.

15:18.192 --> 15:21.761
Shame on you, Daniel, for
goin' back down there.

15:21.763 --> 15:23.996
Shame on all of y'all!

15:23.998 --> 15:25.897
I ain't sittin'
here another minute.

15:27.469 --> 15:29.234
Russell, get to the car.

15:29.236 --> 15:30.670
Get.

15:36.244 --> 15:39.078
Two hours, fellas, two hours.

15:39.080 --> 15:42.647
♪ He loves guitar ♪

15:42.649 --> 15:44.483
♪ But he's just gone ♪

15:52.627 --> 15:54.627
Teresa, wait up.

15:54.629 --> 15:55.696
What is it?

15:57.764 --> 15:59.265
The sump pump on Nine
is on life support.

15:59.267 --> 16:01.000
All right, I'll put in
another work order, then.

16:01.002 --> 16:02.901
Work orders don't mean
shit around here, Teresa,

16:02.903 --> 16:04.170
everybody knows that.

16:04.172 --> 16:05.704
Hell, we don't even
have a mine rescue.

16:05.706 --> 16:06.738
You ain't diggin' enough coal,

16:06.740 --> 16:07.873
so they're forced to make cuts.

16:07.875 --> 16:09.709
Oh that's bullshit.

16:09.711 --> 16:14.048
We dig more goddamn coal
than any mine in this area!

16:17.685 --> 16:18.754
My apologies.

16:21.589 --> 16:22.821
But the old works are
leakin' more methane

16:22.823 --> 16:24.189
than I've seen in 30 years.

16:24.191 --> 16:25.558
Where's the outside
foreman, huh?

16:25.560 --> 16:26.659
He's still sick.

16:26.661 --> 16:28.230
And no replacement?

16:30.831 --> 16:34.666
When those pumps give
out, and they will,

16:34.668 --> 16:37.670
then my men are gonna
drown two miles in,

16:37.672 --> 16:40.776
unless an ignition
burns us up first.

16:41.808 --> 16:43.642
What are you gonna do?

16:43.644 --> 16:45.545
Are you gonna call MSHA?

16:45.547 --> 16:47.747
And what happens
if I call MSHA, huh?

16:47.749 --> 16:50.016
What happens when
MSHA shows up here?

16:50.018 --> 16:52.885
They're gonna shut us down
and we're all screwed.

16:52.887 --> 16:54.119
Is that what you want?

16:54.121 --> 16:57.823
Everyone on your
crew starts on time.

16:57.825 --> 16:59.595
Is that understood?

17:03.630 --> 17:05.099
That's understood.

17:13.807 --> 17:16.007
I am well aware that
just by makin' this call

17:16.009 --> 17:17.877
I could be shuttin' us down,

17:17.878 --> 17:20.845
and my men are not onboard
I want you to know,

17:20.847 --> 17:22.681
but if somethin' were to happen,

17:22.683 --> 17:26.218
we got no mine rescue, we
got no outside foreman.

17:26.220 --> 17:28.588
It seems to me that
corporate cares more

17:28.590 --> 17:30.790
about their coal reserves
and their machinery

17:30.792 --> 17:33.159
than they do about their miners.

17:33.161 --> 17:34.660
All right, well, we
will open up a case

17:34.662 --> 17:36.829
first thing Monday morning.

17:36.831 --> 17:40.766
Now I called MSHA to help
us today, not on Monday.

17:40.768 --> 17:42.801
I understand, but
Mine Safety and Health

17:42.803 --> 17:44.302
is not in the business
of shuttin' down

17:44.304 --> 17:46.638
a mine without an investigation.

17:46.640 --> 17:49.875
I got men goin' into that
mine tonight, do you understand?

17:49.877 --> 17:51.711
I am fully aware,
but it's gonna

17:51.713 --> 17:54.249
have to wait 'til
Monday mornin'.

17:55.882 --> 17:58.350
Yes, sir, thank you very much.

17:58.352 --> 17:59.554
All right.

20:00.742 --> 20:01.677
Hey, son.

20:15.022 --> 20:17.024
That's break 23, John.

20:18.359 --> 20:19.892
It's gettin' worse.

20:19.894 --> 20:20.962
Yeah, got it.

20:49.023 --> 20:50.388
Hey, red hat.

20:50.390 --> 20:52.390
Psst, hey, kid.

20:52.392 --> 20:56.561
Your dad ever told about
Matt and Ben Fellows?

20:56.563 --> 20:57.398
Naw.

20:58.299 --> 21:01.099
You ain't never told him?

21:01.101 --> 21:03.002
No, he didn't tell me.

21:03.004 --> 21:05.271
Oh hell, they both worked
this whole section here

21:05.273 --> 21:07.438
a piece back, good boys.

21:07.440 --> 21:10.509
But since it's your first
time goin' underground,

21:10.511 --> 21:12.077
I just thought maybe you should

21:12.079 --> 21:14.012
just know somethin' about 'em.

21:14.014 --> 21:14.980
Why?

21:14.982 --> 21:15.947
Why?

21:15.949 --> 21:18.349
Matt and Ben's first
eight days underground,

21:18.351 --> 21:20.852
after every single shift,
they'd come out here

21:20.854 --> 21:24.123
and said they seen
somethin', and it was on the,

21:24.125 --> 21:27.458
what was it, ninth, ninth day?

21:27.460 --> 21:29.194
Ninth day they
said Satan appeared

21:29.196 --> 21:30.562
and he said if
you ever come back

21:30.564 --> 21:33.866
down here again,
boys, you gon' die.

21:33.868 --> 21:34.869
Hey hold up.

21:39.540 --> 21:41.909
Did they come back down?

21:44.378 --> 21:45.379
Hey, Daniel.

21:46.613 --> 21:48.047
- Dad.
- He'll tell ya.

21:48.049 --> 21:49.181
Did they
come back down?

21:49.183 --> 21:52.083
Daniel'll tell you
in a minute, now.

21:52.085 --> 21:54.153
Oh hell, they
didn't have a choice.

21:54.155 --> 21:56.588
They have to work, right?

21:56.590 --> 21:58.991
Yeah, but if we just
say hey, you know,

21:58.993 --> 22:01.092
make it through what, 10 days?

22:01.094 --> 22:04.296
You're good to go.

22:04.298 --> 22:06.031
Yeah, it's moments like that

22:06.033 --> 22:08.500
you come face to face with God.

22:08.502 --> 22:10.806
Yeah, or Satan himself.

22:12.005 --> 22:13.340
What happened?

22:14.375 --> 22:15.177
Huh?

22:16.142 --> 22:18.444
What happened to 'em?

22:18.446 --> 22:19.947
Do I tell him?

22:21.081 --> 22:23.985
The roof fell and
them boys dead.

22:27.254 --> 22:32.194
They're here one second,
gone the next.

22:33.360 --> 22:36.561
Cuttin' coal is
risky business, son.

22:36.563 --> 22:39.098
Gotta hold your own
down here, understood?

22:39.100 --> 22:40.001
Yes, sir.

22:41.167 --> 22:42.533
And that story he told ya

22:42.535 --> 22:46.006
about them boys dyin'
what got crushed?

22:47.207 --> 22:48.240
That's a lie, we're
just jokin' with ya.

22:54.648 --> 22:57.316
But men do hallucinate,
the methane gets to 'em.

22:57.318 --> 23:01.486

I don't know men seen 'em all.

24:58.671 --> 24:59.673
Hey, Ryan.

25:00.541 --> 25:02.010
Now looky here.

25:03.310 --> 25:05.410
You need to know the
escape ways outta here

25:05.412 --> 25:06.611
should anything ever happen.

25:06.613 --> 25:08.646
All right, yeah.

25:08.648 --> 25:11.082
Right, so here's
the old works,

25:11.084 --> 25:13.117
North Main, South Main.

25:13.119 --> 25:14.787
Those are the three
lines into this place.

25:14.789 --> 25:15.954
Yeah.

25:15.956 --> 25:18.190
Now the primary escape way
is the way we just come in

25:18.192 --> 25:20.692
through the entrance track.

25:20.694 --> 25:22.327
- Yeah.
- Secondary is up

25:22.329 --> 25:25.164
through the fan house
along the conveyor passage.

25:25.166 --> 25:26.330
Belt, the...

25:26.332 --> 25:27.398
The belt that's
right here, right here.

25:27.400 --> 25:28.634
That's where the conveyor runs.

25:28.636 --> 25:30.335
All right.

25:30.337 --> 25:33.338
Now, if all else fails,
you get your ass right here.

25:33.340 --> 25:35.441
This is the North Main Chamber.

25:35.443 --> 25:36.675
Yes sir, yes sir.

25:36.677 --> 25:38.543
Hey, right here,
North Main Chamber.

25:38.545 --> 25:39.744
North Main Chamber.

25:39.746 --> 25:41.213
It's where we
got a refuge cache,

25:41.215 --> 25:43.714
which has got air,
tools, and whatnot.

25:43.716 --> 25:44.817
Refuge catch?

25:44.819 --> 25:45.851
- Cache.
- Cache.

25:45.853 --> 25:49.620
Refuge, your daddy
calls it a safety coffin.

25:49.622 --> 25:52.790
Why does he call
it a safety coffin?

25:52.792 --> 25:54.827
Safety, well, 'cause
the fuckin' thing

25:54.829 --> 25:57.262
is shaped like a damn coffin.

25:57.264 --> 25:58.329
- Right?
- Yeah.

26:00.467 --> 26:03.335
And if you need it, you're
probably dead already.

26:03.337 --> 26:06.804
But, some shit hit the
fan, I guarantee you

26:06.806 --> 26:09.309
they'd call it a refuge cache.

26:12.279 --> 26:13.415
Hey, looky here.

26:15.381 --> 26:17.683
I been doin' this
damn near 30 years.

26:17.685 --> 26:21.752
Your family has got almost
two centuries underground.

26:21.754 --> 26:22.788
Yeah.

26:22.790 --> 26:24.459
Gon' be fine, son.

26:25.892 --> 26:27.326
- Yeah.
- All right.

26:27.328 --> 26:28.760
Now you go over there,
have Daniel show you

26:28.762 --> 26:30.361
how to bolt the roof.

26:30.363 --> 26:31.496
Yes, sir.

26:31.498 --> 26:34.368
You
wanna shut that off?

26:37.338 --> 26:38.373
Yo, hey.

26:39.340 --> 26:40.638
Shut it off, man.

26:40.640 --> 26:41.642
Shut it off!

26:46.312 --> 26:48.780
Damn.

26:48.782 --> 26:52.150
Hey yo, are we makin' that
damn turn yet or what?

26:52.152 --> 26:55.186
No, we still got
three full cuts today.

26:55.188 --> 26:57.556
Go to short cuts if ya have to.

26:57.558 --> 27:00.259
And no more rock fallin'
through, Rooster.

27:00.261 --> 27:01.792
I don't give a
shit about the rocks!

27:01.794 --> 27:03.729
The dust what's gonna kill us!

27:03.731 --> 27:04.730
Yeah, I hear ya.

27:04.732 --> 27:06.464
Tiny, get back there and see

27:06.466 --> 27:09.201
if you can fix that
suppression control.

27:09.203 --> 27:10.801
And wet us down
before we flame up.

27:10.803 --> 27:13.440
Yes, sir, I'm on it.

27:25.418 --> 27:27.319
Look right here.

27:27.321 --> 27:28.419
What we got here is
our plate, all right?

27:28.421 --> 27:29.620
All right,
all right, okay.

27:29.622 --> 27:30.688
See this right here?

27:30.690 --> 27:32.191
This what, hey, focus, man.

27:32.193 --> 27:33.457
That's how you get
hurt down here.

27:33.459 --> 27:34.658
- All right?
- Yeah.

27:34.660 --> 27:38.463
It's what keeps these mines
from droppin' on our head.

27:38.465 --> 27:41.233
Straight hole, straight
bolt, loose pin set.

27:41.235 --> 27:41.867
Ya got it?

27:41.869 --> 27:42.967
Yeah.

27:47.574 --> 27:48.773
Come on.

27:48.775 --> 27:50.208
Get up!

27:50.210 --> 27:53.444
Nothin' but a shift
in the roof, come on.

27:53.446 --> 27:56.647
Get used to it,
happens all the time.

27:56.649 --> 27:57.582
- Hey, hey.
- Don't wanna die

27:57.584 --> 27:58.817
Take a deep breath, breathe.

27:58.819 --> 28:01.523
Boo!

28:02.356 --> 28:03.488
Everybody all right?

28:03.490 --> 28:05.456
Yeah, that rookie's all right.

28:05.458 --> 28:07.326
Get it fixed.

28:07.328 --> 28:09.261
If you need help, ask for it.

28:09.263 --> 28:10.428
- Hey, Rooster.
- Ho!

28:10.430 --> 28:11.597
Get that miner goin'.

28:11.599 --> 28:12.763
Change of plans.

28:12.765 --> 28:14.398
We're goin' down
entry one before long.

28:14.400 --> 28:15.967
Hold it!

28:15.969 --> 28:19.637
Ryan, get back to
dustin' walls, go on.

28:19.639 --> 28:22.374
Boss, I'm gonna get down to
that power station, all right?

28:22.376 --> 28:25.743
All right, well
be quick about it.

28:53.407 --> 28:55.339
You hear that?

28:55.341 --> 28:56.774
Y'all can hear that?

29:00.014 --> 29:02.550
Hey, we gotta move.

29:14.527 --> 29:16.697
She's comin' down, boys!

29:18.331 --> 29:20.598
Run, run, out, out,
past the rim, go!

29:20.600 --> 29:21.767
Dad!

29:21.769 --> 29:24.839
Everybody, everybody,
pass the rim.

29:25.872 --> 29:27.571
Everybody, out past the rim.

29:27.573 --> 29:29.540
Past the rim, move!

29:29.542 --> 29:30.378
Kenny!

29:32.946 --> 29:34.849
Kenny, Kenny, let's go.

29:36.317 --> 29:37.785
You trust it to God.

29:40.053 --> 29:41.255
Come on, go!

29:47.960 --> 29:49.727
Zeke, Zeke!

29:49.729 --> 29:50.564
Daniel!

30:29.570 --> 30:30.672
Judas Priest.

30:31.972 --> 30:34.505
We got ripped through.

30:34.507 --> 30:37.041
Yeah, we
got ripped through.

30:37.043 --> 30:38.076
Ryan!

30:40.747 --> 30:41.579
Ryan!

30:41.581 --> 30:42.850
Oh no.

30:46.887 --> 30:49.057
Ryan, Ryan, you all right?

30:50.556 --> 30:52.758
You all right, son?

30:52.760 --> 30:54.992
Did ya get pegged?

31:13.580 --> 31:18.552
Damn.

31:18.985 --> 31:20.685
God saved us.

31:20.687 --> 31:23.088
God saved us, did He?

31:23.090 --> 31:24.556
Well, you go ahead and thank Him

31:24.558 --> 31:26.892
for puttin' us plum in
the middle of this shit.

31:26.894 --> 31:29.094
We lost Harper, Tiny.

31:29.096 --> 31:30.829
Miller's dead.

31:30.831 --> 31:32.062
It's okay, son.

31:32.064 --> 31:34.733
Think maybe we should
pray for him, then.

31:34.735 --> 31:35.833
Where's Daniel?

31:35.835 --> 31:37.469
I saw Daniel.

31:37.471 --> 31:38.569
It don't look good.

31:38.571 --> 31:39.905
Shit, no.

31:39.907 --> 31:41.873
Hey, you know
you killed me, huh?

31:41.875 --> 31:43.207
You know I'm gonna die down here

31:43.209 --> 31:44.443
- because of you?
- Hey!

31:44.445 --> 31:46.477
Listen, son, you listen good.

31:46.479 --> 31:47.846
- You keep your shit together.
- Knock it off!

31:47.848 --> 31:49.047
- Now or never!
- Who knows

31:49.049 --> 31:50.915
which direction that
blast came from?

31:50.917 --> 31:52.951
I thought it came from out
behind the Mains back there.

31:52.953 --> 31:54.552
Mains is that way.

31:54.554 --> 31:57.755
Kenny's right, Kenny's right.

31:57.757 --> 32:01.126
My back was facin'
somewhere, out by the mouth.

32:01.128 --> 32:02.927
I think it came
from behind me.

32:02.929 --> 32:06.097
I think whichever
way we choose,

32:06.099 --> 32:08.833
we're still a long way from
the Mains no matter what.

32:08.835 --> 32:09.937
Yes we are.

32:13.706 --> 32:15.773
- Shit.
- All right.

32:15.775 --> 32:18.643
Well let's spread out and
find those boys, all right.

32:18.645 --> 32:20.611
And if they didn't make it,
then just put 'em together

32:20.613 --> 32:22.716
so that others can find 'em.

32:26.552 --> 32:30.088
And strip 'em of their
lights and rescuers,

32:30.090 --> 32:32.624
tools, curtains, anything,
anything we can find

32:32.626 --> 32:34.626
to help us get outta
here, all right?

32:34.628 --> 32:36.160
Spread out and
let's get workin'.

32:36.162 --> 32:37.695
All right.

32:37.697 --> 32:39.630
All right, boys, holler out.

32:39.632 --> 32:42.934
Harper!

32:42.936 --> 32:44.205
- Harper!
- Hello?

32:51.744 --> 32:52.580
Help.

32:53.780 --> 32:54.646
Hello?

33:00.052 --> 33:00.888
Help.

33:03.823 --> 33:04.658
Daniel!

33:08.794 --> 33:10.262
Oh, Tiny.

33:10.264 --> 33:13.264
He just had a newborn, James.

33:13.266 --> 33:14.100
Come on.

33:15.235 --> 33:15.869
Oh.

33:19.773 --> 33:22.009
Our Father who art in heaven.

33:35.688 --> 33:37.757
Coal miner, coal miner.

33:43.796 --> 33:46.033
I can get ya home, brother.

34:03.350 --> 34:06.350
Thy kingdom
come, thy will be done

34:06.352 --> 34:08.786
on Earth as it is in heaven.

34:08.789 --> 34:10.722
Give us this day our daily bread

34:10.724 --> 34:12.056
and forgive us our trespasses

34:12.059 --> 34:15.694
as we forgive those who
trespass against us.

34:15.696 --> 34:18.163
Lead us not into temptation.

34:34.982 --> 34:38.786
I'm sorry, man.

34:47.293 --> 34:52.033
Let's go, let's go,
let's go.

35:02.209 --> 35:05.745
Us from evil, for
thine is the kingdom

35:06.879 --> 35:09.747
and the power and glory.

35:09.749 --> 35:10.917
Forever, amen.

35:12.318 --> 35:13.987
God bless you, Tiny.

35:16.055 --> 35:18.059
Sorry, I'm sorry, buddy.

35:24.898 --> 35:26.698
All right, let's go.

35:26.700 --> 35:27.802
There's more.

35:29.436 --> 35:31.669
What about
Daniel and Smitty?

35:31.671 --> 35:34.039
Smitty's right
over here behind me.

35:34.041 --> 35:35.939
I suggest ya leave him be.

35:35.941 --> 35:37.175
No.

35:37.177 --> 35:38.977
All right, gather up
anything and everything

35:38.979 --> 35:42.814
you can find and put
it in the powder bag.

35:42.816 --> 35:44.214
If I'm right about the explosion

35:44.216 --> 35:46.718
and we find the North
Main, we can hole up there

35:46.720 --> 35:49.023
and hope that someone arrives.

35:50.957 --> 35:51.823
All right, let's move.

35:51.825 --> 35:53.227
Be careful, fellas.

35:54.260 --> 35:55.862
- All right!
- Yeah.

35:56.930 --> 35:58.830
Eh, get the boy.

35:58.832 --> 36:00.198
Come on, boy.

36:00.200 --> 36:02.100
I see ya back 'ere.

36:02.102 --> 36:02.937
Come on.

36:11.711 --> 36:14.479
I found the lifeline.

36:14.481 --> 36:16.751
See that there?

36:19.151 --> 36:21.856
- There we go.
- Look at that.

36:22.988 --> 36:24.891
Watch your foot.

36:37.037 --> 36:38.135
Hey, Kenny.

36:38.137 --> 36:39.236
You feel that, Zeke?

36:39.238 --> 36:40.171
What's that?

36:40.173 --> 36:41.805
The fan's still runnin'.

36:41.807 --> 36:43.173
That's a good
sign, little brother,

36:43.175 --> 36:44.978
that's a good sign.

36:46.912 --> 36:48.879
Damn it!

36:48.881 --> 36:51.883
Goddamn it, the whole
fuckin' panel's caved in.

36:51.885 --> 36:53.151
Well which way now?

36:53.153 --> 36:55.252
Well I guess we gotta
find a secondary, John.

36:55.254 --> 36:56.854
Well what if we
find an old route

36:56.856 --> 36:58.222
out through the travel road?

36:58.224 --> 37:00.225
Naw, naw, there's
a fire down here.

37:00.227 --> 37:02.926
It's surely gon' be burnin'
there, by the old works?

37:02.928 --> 37:03.764
Come on.

37:05.966 --> 37:06.930
Oh for God's sake, Kenny.

37:06.932 --> 37:08.334
Goddamn it, really?

37:10.803 --> 37:14.108
We're in a world of
shit no matter what.

37:17.042 --> 37:17.975
John.

37:17.977 --> 37:19.144
What?

37:19.146 --> 37:21.211
Don't you dare.

37:21.213 --> 37:22.981
I was there when you
got your 10 year chip,

37:22.983 --> 37:24.515
do you remember that?

37:24.517 --> 37:25.783
Yeah.

37:25.785 --> 37:27.919
- You remember that?
- Yeah.

37:27.921 --> 37:30.925
Remember how hard
fought that was?

37:31.957 --> 37:32.726
Yeah.

37:33.894 --> 37:36.361
We're gon' get outta here.

37:36.363 --> 37:37.732
And then what?

37:44.937 --> 37:45.939
There ya go.

37:53.146 --> 37:55.446
You go ahead, son.

37:55.448 --> 37:57.084
You deserve that.

38:05.224 --> 38:07.859
Fellas, there's
somethin' I gotta tell you.

38:07.861 --> 38:09.026
What?

38:09.028 --> 38:10.127
I called MSHA.

38:10.129 --> 38:11.329
Aw!

38:11.331 --> 38:12.897
I told 'em we
got no mine rescue,

38:12.899 --> 38:13.997
I told 'em about the methane,

38:13.999 --> 38:17.368
I told 'em about the pumps,
I told 'em all of it.

38:17.370 --> 38:18.870
Well then you
fuckin' killed us

38:18.872 --> 38:20.004
we don't dig
ourselves outta here.

38:20.006 --> 38:21.439
Teresa woulda sent
the second shift

38:21.441 --> 38:23.106
down to help dig us out.

38:23.108 --> 38:24.975
You wanna put those boys
in danger, too, right?

38:24.977 --> 38:25.943
Is that you?

38:25.945 --> 38:27.010
- Is that what you want?
- What do you mean?

38:27.012 --> 38:27.946
What do you mean?

38:27.948 --> 38:29.513
I tell you what it means.

38:29.515 --> 38:33.984
If MSHA knows that we
aint' got no mine rescue,

38:33.986 --> 38:37.254
they ain't sendin' no men
into a tickin' time bomb.

38:37.256 --> 38:38.289
That's what that means.

38:38.291 --> 38:39.223
What?

38:39.225 --> 38:40.959
By the book, Zeke.

38:40.961 --> 38:43.627
You always gotta be
by the fuckin' book.

38:43.629 --> 38:44.461
We voted!

38:44.463 --> 38:46.065
Yeah, we voted.

38:47.566 --> 38:51.035
Now we are down here
on our own, fellas.

38:51.037 --> 38:53.171
And if you wanna live,
we gotta stick together.

38:53.173 --> 38:55.106
Is that understood,
little brother?

38:55.108 --> 38:56.640
John, grab a hold
of that lifeline

38:56.642 --> 38:58.376
and you get us back to the
Mains, you understand me?

38:58.378 --> 38:59.209
Yes, sir.

38:59.211 --> 39:01.012
Come on, Kenny.

39:02.182 --> 39:03.548
Oh boy.

39:03.550 --> 39:05.082
You just keep movin'.

39:05.084 --> 39:06.251
All right, boys.

39:18.398 --> 39:21.531
Number Nine, can you hear me?

39:21.533 --> 39:23.434
Number Nine, can you hear me?

39:25.070 --> 39:25.905
Damn it.

39:40.519 --> 39:42.553
Mine
Safety and Health.

39:42.555 --> 39:45.122
Hello, this is Teresa
Lang, mine manager at Salvia.

39:45.124 --> 39:46.290
This is an emergency.

39:46.292 --> 39:48.059
Transferrin' now.

39:55.035 --> 39:55.870
Power.

40:05.211 --> 40:07.278
We gotta slow down.

40:07.280 --> 40:09.080
I can't get a breath.

40:34.640 --> 40:36.374
Oh, we got smoke, boys.

40:36.376 --> 40:38.042
Move, we got smoke!

40:38.044 --> 40:39.109
- Go, go, go, go, go!
- Go, go!

40:39.111 --> 40:40.044
Let's go, go.

40:40.046 --> 40:41.278
We gotta!

40:41.280 --> 40:42.113

get a curtain up.

40:42.115 --> 40:43.247
Get that curtain up!

40:45.517 --> 40:46.686
Pull it tight.

40:49.155 --> 40:50.120
Keep goin'.

40:50.122 --> 40:51.622
Hold it, put that there.

40:51.624 --> 40:55.629
Yes sir, pull
it tight, just like that.

40:57.062 --> 40:58.997
Cover that hole,
boys, cover that hole.

40:58.999 --> 41:00.097
Ready for the pull.

41:01.133 --> 41:02.466
Get it in there.

41:32.298 --> 41:34.401
Hey, Ryan, grab your hammer.

41:35.702 --> 41:37.568
Looky here, just pound
up on the roof post

41:37.570 --> 41:38.602
three times, all right?

41:38.604 --> 41:39.803
Yeah.

41:39.805 --> 41:43.142
Then wait a few
seconds, pound again.

41:43.809 --> 41:45.609
Like that over and over.

41:45.611 --> 41:48.713
It's a long shot,
but maybe ,

41:48.715 --> 41:50.481
maybe the surface'll hear us.

41:50.483 --> 41:51.415
Right here?

41:51.417 --> 41:53.517
Just right on the plate.

41:57.356 --> 41:59.692
Hold on, wait, wait, listen.

42:11.604 --> 42:13.273
All right, go ahead.

42:16.776 --> 42:18.242

42:24.316 --> 42:27.385

James Elroy speakin'.

43:23.242 --> 43:24.774
Mr. Elroy, I'm
reportin' a potential

43:24.776 --> 43:27.912
methane ignition underground
at Salvia Number Nine.

43:27.914 --> 43:30.680
The power's off and
the trackin' is down.

43:30.682 --> 43:32.550
Where did it come from?

43:32.552 --> 43:36.287
It must have started
in the old works.

43:36.289 --> 43:38.555
We have no mine rescue team

43:38.557 --> 43:40.892
and the outside
foreman is out sick.

43:40.894 --> 43:44.294
I want you to cease all efforts
immediately, you hear me?

43:44.296 --> 43:46.099
Not one damn thing.

43:46.733 --> 43:47.932
You stand by.

43:47.934 --> 43:50.803
We will tell you
what where and how.

43:52.305 --> 43:52.937
Yes, sir.

43:57.309 --> 43:58.575
Smoke.

43:58.577 --> 43:59.376
All right, come on,
put on your rescuers.

43:59.378 --> 44:01.414
Curtain ain't workin'.

44:12.925 --> 44:15.258
I ain't gettin' air in mine.

44:15.260 --> 44:16.593
Mine's not workin'.

44:16.595 --> 44:17.727
Take this
one, take this one.

44:17.729 --> 44:19.800
Get that on him.

44:21.733 --> 44:24.669
Breathe, breathe.

44:24.671 --> 44:26.604
- There we go.
- All right?

44:26.606 --> 44:28.372
All right, men, listen up.

44:28.374 --> 44:31.374
From this point forward no
one takes off their mask.

44:31.376 --> 44:31.975
All right?

44:31.977 --> 44:33.443
No talkin', no nothin'.

44:33.445 --> 44:35.713
That gas can kill you
in seconds, all right?

44:35.715 --> 44:38.915
We have less than
one hour of oxygen.

44:38.917 --> 44:40.450
One hour?

44:40.452 --> 44:41.385
One hour of air?

44:41.387 --> 44:42.752
It is gettin' evil
out here, gentlemen.

44:42.754 --> 44:45.455
One hour,
one hour of air.

44:45.457 --> 44:47.457
- Let's move.
- One hour.

44:47.459 --> 44:48.892
One hour of air.

44:48.894 --> 44:50.530
And let's live.

44:51.497 --> 44:53.631
One hour,
one hour of air.

44:53.633 --> 44:55.466
One hour, one hour of air.

44:55.468 --> 44:57.568
One hour, one hour of air.

44:57.570 --> 45:00.470
One hour, one hour of air.

46:45.845 --> 46:47.314
Phone!

46:57.523 --> 46:58.622
Unit Two to surface.

46:58.624 --> 47:00.490
I repeat, Unit Two to surface.

47:00.492 --> 47:01.691
Come in, surface.

47:01.693 --> 47:02.760
Unit Two, copy.

47:02.762 --> 47:05.463
How many of you are down there?

47:05.465 --> 47:06.629
Four!

47:06.631 --> 47:07.597
- Four miners.
- Okay!

47:07.599 --> 47:09.600
I repeat, four miners.

47:09.602 --> 47:13.037
We're on our way to the North
Main in the traffic way.

47:13.039 --> 47:15.405
We're 50 breaks up from...

47:15.407 --> 47:16.709
Look out!

48:39.858 --> 48:43.929
It's trapped.

48:49.735 --> 48:51.035
It's wedged.

48:57.776 --> 49:02.613
Pull his leg, get the leg,
get the leg, get the leg!

49:02.615 --> 49:05.118
John, it's all right.

49:07.486 --> 49:09.553
- You all right?
- Good job, son.

49:09.555 --> 49:10.620
We're gon' get ya out.

49:10.622 --> 49:11.921
I see a man door.

49:11.923 --> 49:14.158
You're all right.

49:14.160 --> 49:15.693
Oh, don't look at it.

49:15.695 --> 49:16.993
Don't look at it.

49:19.865 --> 49:22.832
Ryan, you help John.

49:22.834 --> 49:24.771
Okay, yes sir.

49:27.173 --> 49:30.744
We gotta try to get
through the man door.

49:47.193 --> 49:48.028
Kenny.

49:49.195 --> 49:50.030
Kenny.

49:58.303 --> 50:00.838
There was a methane
explosion in the Number Nine.

50:00.840 --> 50:03.039
We have four of the nine
miners trapped two miles in by.

50:03.041 --> 50:05.042
They more than likely
had their rescuers on

50:05.044 --> 50:06.709
for 30 minutes by now.

50:06.711 --> 50:09.647
We can not afford another
Long Creek on my watch.

50:09.649 --> 50:11.814
Now we're gon' get those
men out of there, Teresa.

50:11.816 --> 50:13.684
I promise you that, all right?

50:13.686 --> 50:15.251
Now do you have
any dynamite here?

50:15.253 --> 50:16.754
In the shed, we
got six sticks.

50:16.756 --> 50:17.588
All right, good.

50:17.590 --> 50:18.689
Now you keep it
right there for now.

50:18.691 --> 50:20.823
Now how far is that
communication line gonna get me?

50:20.825 --> 50:22.059
Two miles.

50:22.061 --> 50:24.193
All right, we'll go on in
there when it's safe, all right?

50:24.195 --> 50:25.763
They only have 30
minutes of air left.

50:25.765 --> 50:27.865
If we are wrong,
we're not gonna lose

50:27.867 --> 50:31.100
just nine men,
we're gonna lose 12.

50:31.102 --> 50:34.037
I lost 11 men once when
this same thing happened.

50:36.742 --> 50:38.611
Stop, stop!

50:45.017 --> 50:47.787
It's all right, little brother.

50:51.189 --> 50:53.057
You okay, John?

50:53.059 --> 50:54.792
You're okay, John, you're okay.

50:54.794 --> 50:58.798
We got no choice,
this is our only way out.

50:59.932 --> 51:00.867
Three, two.

51:44.977 --> 51:46.245
John!

51:47.178 --> 51:49.182
John!

52:11.403 --> 52:12.935
Listen to me.

52:12.937 --> 52:14.738
John's gone.

52:14.740 --> 52:16.973
We got to get
through the man door.

52:16.975 --> 52:18.841
It's fillin' up in here.

52:18.843 --> 52:19.809
So listen up.

52:19.811 --> 52:20.913
One, two, three.

52:22.782 --> 52:23.383
You ready?

52:25.017 --> 52:25.819
Okay.

52:57.849 --> 52:59.015
Come on.

52:59.017 --> 53:00.350
Okay, right here,
right here, right here.

53:00.352 --> 53:02.285
I got ya, I got ya.

53:02.287 --> 53:04.254
Zeke, Zeke.

53:04.256 --> 53:05.959
I gotcha.

53:06.925 --> 53:08.061
All right, okay.

53:10.896 --> 53:11.861
The water's drainin' outta here.

53:11.863 --> 53:13.129
We gotta keep movin'.

53:13.131 --> 53:14.932
Come on, this is better,
we gotta keep movin'.

53:14.934 --> 53:16.200
Where's
John, where's John?

53:16.202 --> 53:17.367
- Kenny.
- No.

53:17.369 --> 53:18.234
John's gone.

53:18.236 --> 53:19.870
- No!
- John's gone.

53:19.872 --> 53:21.037
- He is, come on.
- No.

53:21.039 --> 53:23.841
Come on, we gotta move, now.

53:23.843 --> 53:24.444
Go!

54:11.524 --> 54:13.960
Not far, not far.

54:15.160 --> 54:17.961
- We okay?
- Man through.

54:17.963 --> 54:18.995
Come on.

54:18.997 --> 54:20.897
One behind the other.

54:20.899 --> 54:23.903
Keep that communication
line comin'.

54:25.236 --> 54:27.005
That's it, come on.

54:29.508 --> 54:31.244
That's the approach.

54:37.282 --> 54:39.284
Hey, hold it back there.

54:41.486 --> 54:44.323
12% oxygen, 15% methane.

55:24.430 --> 55:28.033
All right,
it's the rescuer cache.

55:37.376 --> 55:38.876
Damn it!

55:38.878 --> 55:40.446
Nothin' but red tags.

55:44.450 --> 55:46.216
Ain't nothin' but red tags.

55:46.218 --> 55:48.118
What's wrong?

55:48.120 --> 55:50.086
It's empty.

55:50.088 --> 55:51.256
No air for us.

55:56.428 --> 55:58.060
Hello?

55:58.062 --> 55:59.463
Hello?

55:59.465 --> 56:02.035
Hello, Unit Two to the surface.

56:03.202 --> 56:05.269
Hey, can anyone hear me?

56:05.271 --> 56:06.502
Unit Two to the surface, over.

56:06.504 --> 56:08.571
I repeat, Unit Two
to the surface.

56:10.475 --> 56:12.109
Move.

56:12.111 --> 56:13.977
- Come on!
- Hey.

56:13.979 --> 56:15.111
We need help,
hey, we need help.

56:15.113 --> 56:16.379
Anyone, come on.

56:16.381 --> 56:17.216
God!

56:20.419 --> 56:22.121
I think it's dead.

56:31.562 --> 56:35.167
Son, I'm sorry for
bringin' you down here.

56:36.568 --> 56:38.234
Just keep breathin'.

56:38.236 --> 56:40.206
Just breathe what you got.

56:46.345 --> 56:48.881
This is everything.

56:49.981 --> 56:51.013
Lie down.

56:54.352 --> 56:56.252
- It's okay.
- Dad?

56:56.254 --> 56:58.624
It's okay, just rest.

57:00.658 --> 57:02.028
Oh, just rest.

57:10.669 --> 57:11.671
- Zeke.
- Stop.

57:15.541 --> 57:16.441
Stop, stop.

57:51.309 --> 57:54.276
But men do hallucinate
when methane gets to 'em.

57:54.278 --> 57:56.213
Heaven, Hell, angels, demons.

57:56.215 --> 57:58.985
I don't know, men seen 'em all.

58:12.731 --> 58:13.566
Zeke.

58:14.666 --> 58:18.368
Zeke, is that you?

58:18.370 --> 58:20.236
Zeke, it's me, Daniel.

58:20.238 --> 58:21.171
Daniel!

58:21.173 --> 58:23.709
Yeah, yeah, it's me, it's me!

58:24.542 --> 58:26.309
What happened?

58:26.311 --> 58:27.778
Got all the way up
here to the chamber

58:27.780 --> 58:29.482
and the damn roof fell in on me.

58:30.716 --> 58:32.548
Daniel, we're
not gonna be able

58:32.550 --> 58:34.386
to get this wall down.

58:36.220 --> 58:37.287
That's funny, Zeke.

58:37.289 --> 58:39.225
Ya know, I had a dream.

58:40.358 --> 58:41.524
I had a dream that
you were gonna

58:41.526 --> 58:46.099
be the one that
saved me.

58:47.466 --> 58:50.269
Ya got air over there?

58:51.269 --> 58:52.104
Yeah.

58:53.704 --> 58:56.205
Yeah, I got air, I just,

58:56.207 --> 58:59.109
hey I'm losin' a
lot of blood here.

58:59.111 --> 59:00.810
And I can't feel my arm.

59:00.812 --> 59:04.414
We got, I don't know,
maybe five, maybe 10 minutes

59:04.416 --> 59:06.216
of air left, Daniel.

59:06.218 --> 59:09.655
Five or 10.

59:11.590 --> 59:14.693
Can you
see a phone, Daniel?

59:17.628 --> 59:21.166
I think there's one
a few breaks back.

59:23.334 --> 59:24.169
Zeke, I

59:27.872 --> 59:30.709
wanted you to know
somethin', man.

59:32.376 --> 59:34.711
You've always been badass.

59:35.713 --> 59:38.316
I need you to do
me a favor, man.

59:43.421 --> 59:46.388
I need you to cut
this damn arm off

59:46.390 --> 59:49.262
so I can help get us outta here.

59:51.195 --> 59:53.763
Now I know one of
you's got a saw, okay?

59:53.765 --> 59:55.298
So you gotta do it.

59:55.300 --> 59:56.334
What?

59:57.369 --> 01:00:00.537
Daniel, you're not
thinkin' clearly.

01:00:00.539 --> 01:00:02.905
I'm not gonna
lay here and listen

01:00:02.907 --> 01:00:04.476
to all you guys die

01:00:07.579 --> 01:00:09.245
and watch myself bleed to death

01:00:09.247 --> 01:00:10.347
when I know I can get outta here

01:00:10.349 --> 01:00:13.316
and at least try
to do somethin'!

01:00:13.318 --> 01:00:15.751
You gotta do it, man.

01:00:15.753 --> 01:00:17.387
All right, when
I count to three.

01:00:17.389 --> 01:00:21.358
All right, I'ma
count to three, okay?

01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:23.359
You gotta cut that
damn thing off.

01:00:26.731 --> 01:00:28.397
- No, hold on.
- Heard what he said.

01:00:28.399 --> 01:00:29.432
He's our only chance

01:00:29.434 --> 01:00:30.667
- for help.
- Ryan, he's delusional.

01:00:30.669 --> 01:00:32.602
Let me, he's our only
chance for help, all right?

01:00:32.604 --> 01:00:36.238
And he'll bleed to
death first.

01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:38.341
Hey, hey.

01:00:38.343 --> 01:00:40.580
Wait a minute, man, wait.

01:00:45.716 --> 01:00:47.751
Oh dear God, please.

01:00:47.753 --> 01:00:51.388
Please get me the heck
outta here, please.

01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:52.458
Please help me.

01:00:53.791 --> 01:00:56.193
Better catch that ball, boy.

01:00:56.195 --> 01:00:58.361
You gonna gimme a sticker?

01:00:58.363 --> 01:00:59.963
Gimme a sticker
for my little boy.

01:00:59.965 --> 01:01:00.867
I love you.

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:05.437
Give your mommy a hug
for me, all right?

01:01:09.441 --> 01:01:11.307
Dad, no.

01:01:11.309 --> 01:01:13.343
It's
Kenny, ya hear me?

01:01:13.345 --> 01:01:14.810
Gon' count to three.

01:01:14.812 --> 01:01:17.383
Okay, let's do this on three.

01:01:19.283 --> 01:01:20.417
All right, here we go.

01:01:22.687 --> 01:01:23.488
One,

01:01:25.457 --> 01:01:26.259
two,

01:01:27.593 --> 01:01:29.426
three!

01:01:33.365 --> 01:01:34.466
Dad!

01:01:36.834 --> 01:01:38.403
Just go!

01:01:47.512 --> 01:01:49.613
Come on,
get up, Uncle Zeke.

01:02:00.524 --> 01:02:02.024
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:02:02.026 --> 01:02:02.993
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:02:02.995 --> 01:02:08.534
Let me see if I can
get me out.

01:03:35.787 --> 01:03:37.555
Oh, son of a bitch.

01:04:05.517 --> 01:04:06.716
Mains, Mains!

01:04:06.718 --> 01:04:07.649
We're on our way.

01:04:07.651 --> 01:04:08.651
How many of you are down there?

01:04:08.653 --> 01:04:09.586
We're trapped!

01:04:09.588 --> 01:04:12.421
You gotta blow the rock!

01:04:12.423 --> 01:04:13.591
Dynamite, now.

01:04:15.794 --> 01:04:17.794
Northeast panel.

01:04:17.796 --> 01:04:19.564
Get through the wall.

01:04:20.664 --> 01:04:23.735
Dynamite.

01:04:24.702 --> 01:04:25.537
Dynamite!

01:04:43.155 --> 01:04:46.555
12%
oxygen, 18% methane.

01:04:46.557 --> 01:04:49.728
Three blinks we'll
do another reading.

01:05:19.724 --> 01:05:22.024
Keep movin' forward,
keep movin' forward.

01:05:22.026 --> 01:05:24.126
I am goin' forward.

01:05:49.887 --> 01:05:51.720
Mr. Elroy.

01:05:51.722 --> 01:05:53.892
Mr. Elroy, do you hear me?

01:05:55.626 --> 01:05:57.026
Copy.

01:05:57.028 --> 01:05:58.528
Teresa?

01:05:58.530 --> 01:05:59.762
You have to blow the wall.

01:05:59.764 --> 01:06:00.964
The wall fell and
the men are trapped.

01:06:00.966 --> 01:06:02.164
I've got dynamite.

01:06:02.166 --> 01:06:03.700
I'm followin' your
line down now.

01:06:03.702 --> 01:06:07.069
No, you
stay on the surface.

01:06:07.071 --> 01:06:10.008
I'm followin'
your line down now.

01:06:11.843 --> 01:06:14.446
Gotta go back to the Mains.

01:07:23.948 --> 01:07:25.013
Teresa.

01:07:25.015 --> 01:07:27.015
I'm here.

01:07:27.017 --> 01:07:28.186
I'm all right!

01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:30.919
Teresa.

01:07:30.921 --> 01:07:32.354
Get it to
the northeast terminal.

01:07:32.356 --> 01:07:33.890
Get outta here, now.

01:07:33.892 --> 01:07:34.890
- Go!
- Go!

01:07:34.892 --> 01:07:35.925
Northeast terminal.

01:07:35.927 --> 01:07:37.095
- Come on.
- Go!

01:08:01.820 --> 01:08:03.919
- Come here, Kenny.
- No.

01:08:03.921 --> 01:08:07.559
Kenny.

01:08:14.932 --> 01:08:18.903
Tell Grace that my faith
was always with her.

01:08:43.961 --> 01:08:48.897
Come on.

01:08:54.270 --> 01:08:55.904
This is it.

01:08:55.907 --> 01:08:57.372
Get the sticks out.

Stevie Looney, about 20 years.

01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:31.639
Name's Travice Hurley.

01:14:31.641 --> 01:14:36.380
I've got about roughly
7 1/2 years underground.

01:14:37.748 --> 01:14:41.349
David Beverly,
goin' on 20 years.

01:14:41.351 --> 01:14:46.054
Cock, and I've worked the
coal mines for 42 years.

01:14:46.056 --> 01:14:47.656
My name's Dan Justice
and I been coal minin'

01:14:47.658 --> 01:14:50.125
for about 45 years.

01:14:50.127 --> 01:14:53.094
Patrick Boggs, I been
a miner for 13 years.

01:14:53.096 --> 01:14:55.197
My name's Nathaniel Stacy.

01:14:55.199 --> 01:14:59.471
I been workin' underground
for about 10 months now.

01:15:00.471 --> 01:15:02.371
My dad was a coal miner.

01:15:02.373 --> 01:15:05.041
I followed in his footsteps.

01:15:05.043 --> 01:15:07.809
Just a family
tradition.

01:15:07.811 --> 01:15:11.248
It's in my blood,
that's all my dad done.

01:15:12.650 --> 01:15:16.184
Like I said, I was
raised into it.

01:15:16.186 --> 01:15:18.387
It's the lifestyle
I was raised in

01:15:18.389 --> 01:15:22.191
and I just kinda
picked it up myself.

01:15:22.193 --> 01:15:24.460
Real coal miners
that'll go do it,

01:15:24.462 --> 01:15:27.295
take care of the job, do
whatever they need to do,

01:15:27.297 --> 01:15:29.799
and be right there beside
you no matter what,

01:15:29.801 --> 01:15:31.533
there's not many of us left.

01:15:31.535 --> 01:15:32.634
That's right.

01:15:32.636 --> 01:15:35.103
Coal mining is a way of life.

01:15:35.105 --> 01:15:38.206
It's in my blood, I love it.

01:15:38.208 --> 01:15:40.308
It's a dangerous job,
it's a dirty job,

01:15:40.310 --> 01:15:42.377
but it pays the bills.

01:15:42.379 --> 01:15:43.746
He works seven days a week,

01:15:43.748 --> 01:15:45.814
and I work six, and
sometimes seven,

01:15:45.816 --> 01:15:50.385
and we're here anywhere
from 13 to 15 hours a day.

01:15:50.387 --> 01:15:52.521
So, not much family life.

01:15:52.523 --> 01:15:56.291
You gotta hunt for it to get
an hour or two with the family.

01:15:56.293 --> 01:15:57.160
Yup.

01:15:57.162 --> 01:15:59.094
Absolutely gotta
hunt for the time.

01:15:59.096 --> 01:16:01.263
It's hard on ya,
it's hard on your body.

01:16:01.265 --> 01:16:03.566
It takes a beaten.

01:16:03.568 --> 01:16:05.334
Time consuming.

01:16:05.336 --> 01:16:07.135
You spend more time
here than ya do

01:16:07.137 --> 01:16:09.237
with your families, mainly.

01:16:09.239 --> 01:16:12.841
Ya know, you spend 10,
12 hours a day here.

01:16:12.843 --> 01:16:15.478
You might spend a couple
hours with your family

01:16:15.480 --> 01:16:19.482
and then ya gotta go to bed,
get up for the next day.

01:16:19.484 --> 01:16:22.617
Those are your best
friends under there, ya know.

01:16:22.619 --> 01:16:25.121
You work together,
you talk together.

01:16:25.123 --> 01:16:27.889
You spend more time with
them than you do your family.

01:16:27.891 --> 01:16:31.259
Ya know, so, you
can kinda figure

01:16:31.261 --> 01:16:35.296
what kinda bond ya have and
what they actually mean to ya.

01:16:35.298 --> 01:16:36.432
It don't matter what it is.

01:16:36.434 --> 01:16:37.366
They'll be there.

01:16:37.368 --> 01:16:38.433
All you gotta do is ask.

01:16:38.435 --> 01:16:39.501
That's right.

01:16:39.503 --> 01:16:41.437
You holler, somebody's comin'.

01:16:41.439 --> 01:16:44.439
He won't be runnin' away from
ya, he'll be runnin' to ya.

01:16:44.441 --> 01:16:46.474
When I go underground,
I know I've got help

01:16:46.476 --> 01:16:47.576
if I need help.

01:16:47.578 --> 01:16:48.810
They're there.

01:16:48.812 --> 01:16:51.380
They don't get mad,
they come help me.

01:16:51.382 --> 01:16:53.515
I do the same for them.

01:16:53.517 --> 01:16:55.416
This is my family.

01:16:55.418 --> 01:16:58.319
It's a lot harder
than what people think.

01:16:58.321 --> 01:16:59.722
Ya know, I mean, you get up,

01:16:59.724 --> 01:17:02.491
I know most jobs you work
five and six days a week,

01:17:02.493 --> 01:17:06.929
but here you're back in a
hole probably two, three miles

01:17:06.931 --> 01:17:11.232
and you don't know if you're
gonna see daylight every day.

01:17:11.234 --> 01:17:13.335
You just change the date.

01:17:13.337 --> 01:17:17.438
Ya know, a lot of people
goes in, works in a buildin',

01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:22.310
no worries, no nothin', and
underground you never know.

01:17:22.312 --> 01:17:24.213
Ya know, anything can happen.

01:17:24.215 --> 01:17:27.119
Back where I lived
at, UBB blew up.

01:17:28.252 --> 01:17:30.518
That wasn't four
miles from my house.

01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:32.521
29 men got killed.

01:17:32.523 --> 01:17:35.392
I knew probably 90% of 'em.

01:17:36.327 --> 01:17:39.728
Ya know, I mean,
it's just dangerous.

01:17:39.730 --> 01:17:43.198
Ya know, everybody
gotta watch everybody.

01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:47.271
When you start out, you
love it or you hate it.

01:17:48.838 --> 01:17:50.606
That's really all I know.

01:17:50.608 --> 01:17:51.840
He quoted the Bible

01:17:51.842 --> 01:17:55.277
from time to time and
he said you get to know

01:17:55.279 --> 01:17:58.479
the Lord workin'
deep in the mine

01:17:58.481 --> 01:18:01.450
He raised two good
daughters and one fine son.

01:18:01.452 --> 01:18:05.489
Any man would be proud
of the job he had done.

01:18:07.391 --> 01:18:10.392
We had a couple more
drinks and I took him home.

01:18:10.394 --> 01:18:14.496
And after meeting his
wife, I wrote this song.

01:18:14.498 --> 01:18:17.465
She talked of the danger
deep in the mines,

01:18:17.467 --> 01:18:21.336
the grief and the
worry all the time.

01:18:21.338 --> 01:18:24.639
And the way she talked,
I knew he had black lung.

01:18:24.641 --> 01:18:28.179
