WEBVTT

00:01.260 --> 00:03.160
ANNOUNCER: Previously
on Pretty Little Liars...

00:03.200 --> 00:04.269
What are those?

00:04.300 --> 00:07.098
Ali was talking to somebody
through the personal ads.

00:07.140 --> 00:09.233
People turn on the microphone
and anonymously record

00:09.270 --> 00:11.135
any secret they want to
with the understanding

00:11.170 --> 00:13.206
that a stranger is
gonna sit at this table

00:13.240 --> 00:14.776
and listen _to
a random whisper.

00:16.380 --> 00:17.870
HANNA: Tanner saw
both of us there.

00:17.910 --> 00:21.346
After she takes me down,
she can go after you too,
and it will be all my fault.

00:22.150 --> 00:24.015
Ashley,
will you marry me?

00:24.790 --> 00:26.314
Andrew?

00:26.360 --> 00:27.657
Is there something
going on between you two?

00:27.690 --> 00:29.089
ARIA:
He's helping me study.

00:29.130 --> 00:30.427
Alison was offered
a plea bargaIn.

00:30.460 --> 00:32.348
Part of the deal was
to name her accomplice.

00:32.400 --> 00:33.549
We were afraid
she might name you.

00:33.600 --> 00:35.090
Hanna's been arrested.

00:35.130 --> 00:36.427
VERONICA:
Tanner found the clothes

00:36.470 --> 00:38.097
Mona was wearing
the day she died

00:38.130 --> 00:39.336
and Hanna's blood
was on them.

00:40.540 --> 00:42.064
I'm not taking the plea.

00:44.310 --> 00:47.837
You will be here,
prosecution there.

00:47.880 --> 00:49.700
Don't be afraid
to look at the jury.

00:49.750 --> 00:52.378
We don't want them to think
you have anything to hide.

00:52.420 --> 00:55.309
I don't like the idea of
12 strangers off the street

00:55.350 --> 00:57.511
deciding what happens
to my daughter.

00:57.550 --> 00:59.154
It's the American way.

00:59.190 --> 01:01.408
They know
nothing about me.

01:01.460 --> 01:03.382
If I could just tell them
the whole story...

01:03.430 --> 01:07.753
Alison, we've
discussed this before.

01:07.800 --> 01:10.496
The key to winning this case
isn't telling the jury

01:10.530 --> 01:13.135
desperate stories about
being plotted against.

01:13.170 --> 01:15.866
Our job is to prevent
the prosecutor

01:15.900 --> 01:17.333
from proving his case.

01:17.370 --> 01:19.736
Right now, he has
the tougher job.

01:19.780 --> 01:21.407
Why?

01:21.440 --> 01:22.873
He has to convince
12 jurors

01:22.910 --> 01:24.343
beyond
a reasonable doubt

01:24.380 --> 01:26.314
that Alison killed
Mona.

01:27.180 --> 01:28.317
All we have to do

01:28.350 --> 01:30.409
is make one
of them unsure.

01:33.560 --> 01:34.686
One of them?

01:34.720 --> 01:37.188
That's all it takes.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.488
Opening statements
in Alison's trial

01:41.530 --> 01:42.519
begin at 9 am.

01:42.570 --> 01:43.696
I'm gonna be there.

01:43.730 --> 01:45.368
I'm not sure
that's a good idea.

01:45.400 --> 01:46.537
I'm going.

01:46.570 --> 01:48.629
If something happens
that effects you,

01:48.670 --> 01:50.433
I don't want to hear
about it second hand.

01:50.470 --> 01:52.802
_ _Someone
IS donng this to me.

01:52.840 --> 01:54.376
You understand that,
right?

01:54.410 --> 01:56.401
And I think we know
who that somebody is.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.179
I told you
it's not Ali.

01:58.210 --> 02:00.872
Alison DiLaurentis
is capable of anything.

02:00.920 --> 02:03.411
I've experienced
that firsthand.

02:03.450 --> 02:04.610
But you
can't be certain.

02:04.650 --> 02:07.153
Certain enough.

02:10.230 --> 02:12.357
Hanna, if you know
anything about her,

02:12.400 --> 02:13.697
now is the time
to speak up

02:13.730 --> 02:14.856
while it can
still help you.

02:14.900 --> 02:18.529
Do anything
to save myself?

02:18.570 --> 02:20.435
What part of scripture
is that from?

02:20.470 --> 02:22.335
This is about telling
the truth, Hanna.

02:22.370 --> 02:24.304
_ I am
telling the truth.

02:24.340 --> 02:26.479
I didn't do anything and Ali
didn't do anything either.

02:26.510 --> 02:28.239
I don't care
about the truth!

02:31.850 --> 02:34.171
I care about getting
my daughter out of this place.

02:34.220 --> 02:36.245
That is all
I care about.

02:38.650 --> 02:41.312
SPENCER: You see, if my head
hadn't have been so jet-laggy,

02:41.360 --> 02:42.520
I would have
remembered It sooner.

02:42.560 --> 02:43.959
The number off
of the Varjack receipt

02:43.990 --> 02:45.480
is the same number
as the personal ads

02:45.530 --> 02:46.394
in Ali's house.

02:46.430 --> 02:48.421
How does
this help Hanna?

02:48.460 --> 02:50.189
Well,
if Ali's not guilty,

02:50.230 --> 02:51.868
then they can't charge
Hanna as an accessory.

02:51.900 --> 02:52.889
You can't help
someone commit a crime

02:52.940 --> 02:54.430
that they didn't commit.

02:54.470 --> 02:55.960
But Ali already told us
that the letter

02:56.000 --> 02:57.558
and the passport
are fake.

02:57.610 --> 02:58.907
Why do we think the number
and the ads are real?

02:58.940 --> 03:00.578
I don't know.

03:00.610 --> 03:02.475
But we didn't find the number
with the other things.

03:02.510 --> 03:03.704
So what if
the numbers are the same

03:03.750 --> 03:04.978
What does
that mean?

03:05.010 --> 03:06.875
You know, we call it
and it just rings,

03:06.920 --> 03:08.649
no pick up, no
voice mail, nothing.

03:08.680 --> 03:09.908
Yeah, and meanwhile
Neilan's Law Office

03:09.950 --> 03:11.315
is closed and locked.

03:11.350 --> 03:12.851
But the number
appearing twnce...

03:12.890 --> 03:15.256
It's got to mean something,
we just have to figure it out.

03:15.290 --> 03:17.554
_ What if we_ don't
figure It out In time?

03:20.460 --> 03:22.325
The three of you are
gonna be late for school.

03:22.370 --> 03:24.497
Uh, no, Mom,
teacher's conference.

03:24.530 --> 03:25.792
They dropped
the first two periods.

03:25.830 --> 03:26.990
I told you.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.929
Oh, then, uh,
this is my chance

03:29.970 --> 03:31.506
to talk to
all of you.

03:33.310 --> 03:35.574
I want to strongly suggest
that you girls stay away

03:35.610 --> 03:37.248
from Alison's trial.

03:38.350 --> 03:39.544
This is_
a suggestion?

03:39.580 --> 03:41.673
For Emily
and Aria, yes,

03:41.720 --> 03:43.711
for you it's more
than a suggestion.

03:45.690 --> 03:47.612
What is All gonna think
if we're not there?

03:47.660 --> 03:50.322
I'm more concerned_ about
what other people Will think.

03:50.360 --> 03:51.782
Juries have eyes.

03:51.830 --> 03:53.525
The whole town knows
that we're friends with her.

03:53.560 --> 03:54.720
Yeah, if we don't go,
it'll be like saying

03:54.760 --> 03:55.988
we think
she's guilty.

03:56.030 --> 03:57.827
I can't tell you
and Emily what to do,

03:57.870 --> 03:59.599
but consider your actions.

03:59.640 --> 04:00.993
Okay, so what
are we gonna do

04:01.040 --> 04:02.632
when Hanna
goes to trial?

04:02.670 --> 04:04.467
Are we just supposed to
turn our backs on her too?

04:04.510 --> 04:06.637
We're not talking
about ethics.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.307
That's for sure.

04:08.340 --> 04:09.546
Maybe we should go.

04:09.580 --> 04:10.706
Yeah.

04:14.620 --> 04:16.315
Spencer,

04:16.350 --> 04:17.578
I want you
to promise me

04:17.620 --> 04:19.679
you won't go
near that courtroom.

04:23.690 --> 04:24.827
* Got a secret

04:24.860 --> 04:26.054
* Can you keep it?

04:26.090 --> 04:28.490
* Swear this one
you'll save *

04:28.530 --> 04:30.760
_* Better lock it
in your pocket *

04:30.800 --> 04:33.337
* Taking this one
to the grave *

04:33.370 --> 04:38.034
* IfI show you then I know
you won't tell what I said *

04:38.070 --> 04:43.747
* 'Cause two can keep a secret
if one of them is dead *

04:48.950 --> 04:51.339
Everything I've tried to trace
this number back to a source

04:51.390 --> 04:53.813
just disappears into
a black hole of nothingness.

04:53.860 --> 04:56.920
No tagged ID,
no localizing signature,

04:56.960 --> 04:58.757
the phone on the other end
could be on Mars

04:58.790 --> 05:00.098
or on the other side
of this room.

05:00.130 --> 05:02.360
An insanely secure phone
and somebody uses it

05:02.400 --> 05:03.697
to order pizza?

05:03.730 --> 05:05.061
Maybe they don't know
what they have.

05:05.100 --> 05:06.931
Then why don't they
pick up when we call?

05:06.970 --> 05:09.097
Do you have
a burner phone?

05:09.140 --> 05:11.358
What color?

05:11.410 --> 05:12.775
It's just gonna
keep ringing.

05:12.810 --> 05:14.505
Well, let's see
what happens

05:14.540 --> 05:16.076
when I put it
in writing.

05:20.950 --> 05:23.089
Holly Golightly
or Holly Varjack?

05:23.120 --> 05:24.781
Send it.

05:24.820 --> 05:26.685
What if we're not
on the same book club?

05:26.720 --> 05:27.857
Then we'll figure out
something else?

05:27.890 --> 05:29.528
Ali's running
out of time.

05:29.560 --> 05:30.527
And so is Hanna.

05:30.560 --> 05:32.619
I know.

05:32.660 --> 05:36.050
Spence, are you gonna be
there tomorrow at the trial?

05:37.600 --> 05:38.965
I don't know.

05:41.570 --> 05:42.707
Listen, you guys,

05:42.740 --> 05:43.866
I have to go
do something.

05:43.910 --> 05:45.730
So I'll talk
to you all later.

05:45.770 --> 05:47.374
Sure.

05:49.880 --> 05:51.541
Are you gonna be
visiting Hanna today?

05:51.580 --> 05:53.878
Tomorrow, but she said
she'll try to call me today.

05:53.920 --> 05:56.480
She has to get to Ali and
ask about the phone number.

06:00.690 --> 06:01.987
Jason.

06:02.830 --> 06:03.888
Hello, Spencer.

06:03.930 --> 06:05.079
I left you messages.

06:05.130 --> 06:05.926
I know.

06:05.960 --> 06:07.655
We need to talk.

06:07.700 --> 06:08.689
I don't think
that's such a good idea.

06:08.730 --> 06:09.958
Jason...

06:10.000 --> 06:11.399
We've pretty much
exhausted anything

06:11.430 --> 06:12.692
that we have to
say to each other.

06:12.740 --> 06:13.832
You need to listen
to me, okay?

06:13.870 --> 06:15.394
No, I don't.

06:15.440 --> 06:16.907
I did listen to you
and now they have me down

06:16.940 --> 06:18.567
as a prosecution
witness.

06:18.610 --> 06:19.702
I'm sorry.

06:19.740 --> 06:20.968
Oh, you're sorry?

06:21.010 --> 06:23.149
Good.

06:23.180 --> 06:25.546
Please, we need to talk
about how Ali isn't guilty.

06:26.980 --> 06:28.516
Get in the car,
Jason.

06:28.550 --> 06:29.619
Please!

06:29.650 --> 06:31.049
Get in the car now!

06:31.090 --> 06:32.853
Mr. DiLaurentis, I just
want to talk to Jason.

06:32.890 --> 06:34.118
I'm not interested
in what you want.

06:34.160 --> 06:36.458
What you want
doesn't help Alison.

06:36.490 --> 06:39.721
We're neighbors
at least for the moment.

06:39.760 --> 06:41.022
In case you forgot,
your house is the one

06:41.060 --> 06:43.665
with the big gate
and the wall.

06:43.700 --> 06:45.099
Stay on the other side
of it.

06:56.610 --> 06:58.146
Hey.

06:58.180 --> 06:59.647
Hey.

06:59.680 --> 07:01.045
You've been
hard to find.

07:01.080 --> 07:02.172
I know.

07:02.220 --> 07:03.949
I'm sorry, I meant to
text you back

07:03.990 --> 07:05.139
but there's this...

07:05.190 --> 07:06.714
You know,
there's--

07:06.760 --> 07:07.784
there's a lot going on
right now.

07:07.820 --> 07:08.855
I know.

07:08.890 --> 07:10.448
How'd it go?

07:10.490 --> 07:11.855
The test.

07:11.890 --> 07:13.949
Am I a successful tutor?

07:14.000 --> 07:16.628
Very successful.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.194
Good.

07:19.270 --> 07:20.134
How's Mike?

07:20.170 --> 07:21.489
He's okay,
I guess.

07:21.540 --> 07:22.564
He's up in Harrisburg

07:22.610 --> 07:23.907
with his lacrosse team.

07:23.940 --> 07:25.635
They're turning it
into a field trip.

07:25.670 --> 07:28.776
But I'm just kind of glad
he's out of town

07:28.810 --> 07:31.142
to keep his mind off,
you know...

07:31.180 --> 07:32.477
The trial?

07:32.520 --> 07:34.078
Yeah, the trial.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.974
It's happening fast,
isn't it?

07:36.020 --> 07:37.988
That's how Mr.
DiLaurentis wanted it.

07:38.020 --> 07:39.908
No motions, no delays.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.212
I guess he thinks
that's best for Alison.

07:42.260 --> 07:43.887
I guess so.

07:43.930 --> 07:46.490
Aanay,
how are you?

07:46.530 --> 07:47.997
Me?
Fine.

07:48.030 --> 07:51.193
I'm getting a little tired
of memorializing Mona.

07:51.230 --> 07:53.869
Mrs. Horowitz
keeps talking about her.

07:53.900 --> 07:55.128
She's just trying
to understand

07:55.170 --> 07:56.535
what happened
like the rest of us.

07:56.570 --> 07:58.060
I suppose.

07:58.110 --> 08:00.578
Looks like she's ready to
nominate Mona for sainthood.

08:00.610 --> 08:02.805
Our best scholar,

08:02.850 --> 08:04.977
our martyred hero,

08:05.010 --> 08:07.547
like she won every
championship on her own.

08:07.580 --> 08:10.117
I guess she was a pretty
aggressive competitor.

08:10.150 --> 08:12.550
Not aggressive,
vicious.

08:12.590 --> 08:15.013
I've seen her intellectually
kneecap dozens of kids,

08:15.060 --> 08:16.584
and the only thing Mona likes
better than winning

08:16.630 --> 08:17.927
is taking the credit.

08:17.960 --> 08:19.552
We're luclq
she didn't get to college

08:19.600 --> 08:22.592
and start thinking about
running for president.

08:23.770 --> 08:25.021
Are you saying that

08:25.070 --> 08:26.731
the world's better off
without her?

08:26.770 --> 08:29.898
I'm just saying there are
other people on this team.

08:39.620 --> 08:41.019
( cell phone ringing )

08:43.990 --> 08:45.844
Hello?

08:45.890 --> 08:46.982
WOMAN: ( on phone) This call
is from the Chester Women's

08:47.020 --> 08:48.749
Correctional Facility.

08:48.790 --> 08:51.623
You have a call from _inmate
Alison DiLaurentis.

08:51.660 --> 08:54.026
To accept this call,
press 1.

08:56.630 --> 08:57.927
Hello, Ali.

08:58.770 --> 09:00.237
ALI: Hello, Emily.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.632
You okay?

09:03.970 --> 09:05.232
Never better.

09:06.340 --> 09:08.274
You'll be fine.

09:08.310 --> 09:09.846
Really?

09:09.880 --> 09:12.041
What makes you
say that?

09:13.050 --> 09:14.870
I'm sorry.

09:14.920 --> 09:16.888
No, I'm sorry.

09:16.920 --> 09:19.809
I didn't call
to say that.

09:19.860 --> 09:22.010
Ijust...

09:25.230 --> 09:29.052
Listen, tomorrow,
will you be there?

09:30.670 --> 09:31.921
I'll try.

09:32.870 --> 09:34.235
You'll try?

09:36.400 --> 09:38.004
I'll be there.

09:38.040 --> 09:40.008
Thank you.

09:40.040 --> 09:42.907
( keys jingling )

09:42.950 --> 09:44.645
Somebody said
it was raining.

09:46.050 --> 09:48.177
Is it raining
back home?

09:49.080 --> 09:52.208
Yes, it's--
it's raining.

09:59.060 --> 10:00.618
Good night, Em.

10:00.660 --> 10:02.321
Good night, Ali.

10:26.890 --> 10:31.224
* I'm_ not sure
what I'm looking for anymore *

10:31.260 --> 10:35.799
* I just know that
I'm harder to console *

10:35.830 --> 10:38.298
* I don't see
who I'm trying to be *

10:38.330 --> 10:40.195
* Instead of me

10:40.240 --> 10:45.234
* But the key
is a question of control *

11:02.160 --> 11:06.790
* Can you say what you're
trying to play anyway? *

11:06.830 --> 11:11.369
* I just pay while you're
breaking all the rules *

11:11.400 --> 11:15.837
* All the signs that I find
have been underlined *

11:15.870 --> 11:20.034
* Devils thrive on the drive
that is fueled *

11:20.080 --> 11:24.403
* All this running around,
well, it's getting me down *

11:24.450 --> 11:28.910
* Just give me a pain
that I'm used to *

11:28.950 --> 11:33.159
* I don't need to believe
all the dreams you conceive *

11:33.190 --> 11:37.752
* You just need to achieve
something that rings true *

11:37.790 --> 11:41.897
* All this running around,
well, it's getting me down *

11:41.930 --> 11:46.469
* Just give me a pain
that I'm used to *

11:46.500 --> 11:50.231
* I don't need to believe
all the dreams you conceive *

11:50.270 --> 11:55.207
* You just need to achieve
something that rings true *

11:56.080 --> 11:57.775
Remember high school?

12:00.050 --> 12:02.268
Remember when every
hallway slight

12:02.320 --> 12:04.311
was like an assault?

12:04.350 --> 12:07.148
When allegiances
and enemies

12:07.190 --> 12:11.524
were magnified
out of all proportion?

12:11.560 --> 12:14.324
It is a_world
where a perceived opponent

12:14.360 --> 12:16.521
must be dealt
with quickly,

12:16.560 --> 12:18.790
without remorse.

12:18.830 --> 12:21.833
And that is what
Alison DiLaurentis did

12:21.870 --> 12:23.235
to Mona Vanderwaal.

12:24.510 --> 12:26.239
Miss Marcus
will be up here shortly

12:26.270 --> 12:28.170
and she is going to
tell you an amazing story

12:28.210 --> 12:29.438
about
Alison DiLaurentis.

12:29.480 --> 12:31.448
How she was kidnapped
and traumatized

12:31.480 --> 12:33.209
by two years
of captivity.

12:33.250 --> 12:36.811
How she escaped her captors
and returned home,

12:36.850 --> 12:38.886
helped by her
closest friends.

12:38.920 --> 12:40.888
It is a remarkable story.

12:42.120 --> 12:44.259
It's breathtaking.

12:46.260 --> 12:48.148
None of it happened.

12:51.230 --> 12:53.391
It's a fairy tale.

12:55.240 --> 12:56.491
The commonwealth
Will prove,

12:56.540 --> 12:58.132
with direct testimony
of witnesses,

12:58.170 --> 13:00.400
that Alison DiLaurentis'
epic tale

13:00.440 --> 13:02.977
of abduction _
and escape is a lie.

13:03.010 --> 13:04.841
It is a lie
created by her

13:04.880 --> 13:08.816
and perpetuated by the friends
that helped to "save" her.

13:18.160 --> 13:21.857
Mona Vanderwaal
knew the truth.

13:21.900 --> 13:24.824
She had the power to destroy
the fantasy created by Alison

13:24.870 --> 13:28.192
and maintained with her
little group of followers.

13:28.240 --> 13:30.606
And that is why
Alison DiLaurentis

13:30.640 --> 13:34.132
planned and carried out
the murder of Mona Vanderwaal,

13:34.180 --> 13:39.300
consigning her to a cruel,
anonymous end.

13:48.360 --> 13:49.554
They know about All
not being kidnapped.

13:49.590 --> 13:50.887
They probably know
about New York too.

13:50.930 --> 13:51.885
How could they know?

13:51.930 --> 13:53.227
Witnesses.

13:53.260 --> 13:54.591
Spencer, he said
they've got witnesses.

13:55.930 --> 13:56.919
Cyrus.

13:56.970 --> 13:58.289
Cyrus?

13:58.330 --> 13:59.558
What about Cyrus?

13:59.600 --> 14:01.534
The cops must have found
Cyrus.

14:01.570 --> 14:03.265
He knows the whole
kidnapping story

14:03.310 --> 14:05.198
and he'd do anything
to save himself.

14:05.240 --> 14:06.207
Aria, where's Mike?

14:06.240 --> 14:07.207
He's in Harrisburg.

14:07.240 --> 14:08.207
Good.

14:08.240 --> 14:09.502
Good?

14:09.540 --> 14:10.871
What do you mean good?
Why is that good?

14:10.910 --> 14:12.172
You knew about this.

14:12.210 --> 14:13.916
You all knew _
and you told the police.

14:13.950 --> 14:15.508
This isn't going to solve
the problem, Mr. DiLaurentis.

14:15.550 --> 14:17.188
You talked her into it,
that's what happened.

14:17.220 --> 14:18.084
The four of you
talked her into this.

14:18.120 --> 14:19.519
It was your idea.

14:19.550 --> 14:21.086
Dad, A|i lied to them
the same as she lied to us.

14:21.120 --> 14:22.189
Jason,
you don't know--

14:22.220 --> 14:23.983
Not here,
gentlemen.

14:30.500 --> 14:31.990
You heard all that?

14:32.030 --> 14:33.292
Yeah, I heard.

14:33.340 --> 14:34.967
They adjourned
for the day

14:35.000 --> 14:36.228
but we'll call
if anything else happens.

14:36.270 --> 14:38.261
Okay.

14:58.160 --> 15:00.390
( door lock buzzing )

15:13.740 --> 15:15.674
The personal ads
are real.

15:15.710 --> 15:18.099
The ads are real
but the passport is fake.

15:18.150 --> 15:19.208
How does that work?

15:19.250 --> 15:20.478
Somebody planted them,

15:20.520 --> 15:21.976
but I hid things
in the house too.

15:22.020 --> 15:23.647
Everybody hides things,
Hanna.

15:23.690 --> 15:25.715
And the phone number
Spencer found?

15:25.750 --> 15:27.149
That's real.

15:27.190 --> 15:28.452
Who were you talking to?

15:28.490 --> 15:30.378
Not talking, texting.

15:30.430 --> 15:31.988
When my mother
was killed,

15:32.030 --> 15:33.657
somebody bought a tribute
out in the paper.

15:33.700 --> 15:35.952
All it said was "Goodnight,
light" and the red balloon

15:36.000 --> 15:38.969
and a response number,
a code the papers use.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.536
"Goodnight light."

15:40.570 --> 15:42.231
I know
that's from a book.

15:42.270 --> 15:43.567
My mother used to read that
to me when I was a baby.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.259
Well,
who would know that?

15:45.310 --> 15:46.561
That's what
I was trying to find out.

15:46.610 --> 15:48.407
So I answered
and 2 days later

15:48.440 --> 15:51.000
another ad, "goodnight nobody,
goodnight brush."

15:51.050 --> 15:53.371
"Goodnight to the old lady
whispering hush."

15:53.420 --> 15:55.376
And then a phone number,
I sent a text.

15:55.420 --> 15:57.217
Why didn't you tell us
you were doing this?

15:57.250 --> 15:59.343
You've been talking to "A"
and you never said a word.

15:59.390 --> 16:01.210
Aria killed Shana
in New York.

16:01.260 --> 16:03.683
Okay, my mother was buried
in Spencer's baclqard.

16:03.730 --> 16:06.290
I was afraid that
you were gonna get hurt.

16:06.330 --> 16:08.389
Whoever it was,

16:08.430 --> 16:10.398
said they knew
who killed my mother.

16:10.430 --> 16:12.227
They were just
torturing me.

16:12.270 --> 16:14.761
It wasn't "A,"
it was Mona.

16:14.800 --> 16:17.462
How are you so sure
it was Mona?

16:17.510 --> 16:19.068
The only thing
I know for sure is

16:19.110 --> 16:21.374
that the texts stopped
when Mona was killed.

16:31.490 --> 16:35.449
Emily and Aria
were at the courthouse today.

16:35.490 --> 16:37.321
Well, whoever told you
that must have told you

16:37.360 --> 16:39.351
that I wasn't there
with them.

16:41.560 --> 16:43.596
Did you know
what was gonna happen?

16:43.630 --> 16:45.291
I heard.

16:45.330 --> 16:47.389
Too late to do
anything about it.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.396
Too late to do anything
except to warn me

16:49.440 --> 16:50.759
not to be there?

16:50.810 --> 16:52.732
Maybe now you understand
why I did that.

16:52.770 --> 16:55.330
I'm still trying to
understand

16:55.380 --> 16:56.779
why you and Melissa
lied to me

16:56.810 --> 16:58.300
and tried to keep me
from coming back

16:58.350 --> 16:59.772
when my friends
needed me?

16:59.810 --> 17:03.485
Someone will be going to prison
for a very long time.

17:03.520 --> 17:06.444
My only concern is that
it's not going to be you.

17:07.560 --> 17:08.811
Don't you want to
ask me

17:08.860 --> 17:11.181
if I knew about
Ali's fake kidnapping?

17:12.630 --> 17:13.824
No.

17:13.860 --> 17:17.091
Because I'm telling you,
you didn't.

17:22.500 --> 17:23.728
All that time she was

17:23.770 --> 17:24.839
talking to somebody
about her mother,

17:24.870 --> 17:26.462
she never told you?

17:27.410 --> 17:29.105
_ She thinks
it was Mona.

17:30.180 --> 17:31.647
Ali is scared.

17:31.680 --> 17:33.341
She's trying to be
brave

17:33.380 --> 17:35.371
but I can see something
running around inside her,

17:35.420 --> 17:36.773
behind her eyes.

17:36.820 --> 17:39.789
Is there anything running
around behind your eyes?

17:39.820 --> 17:43.483
Oh, yeah, snakes, spiders,
flying monkeys...

17:43.530 --> 17:45.748
nothing
I can't handle.

17:49.130 --> 17:50.688
We're gonna get you
out of here...

17:51.500 --> 17:52.762
I promise.

17:52.800 --> 17:54.290
Be careful _
what you promise.

17:54.340 --> 17:56.137
Hanna.

17:56.170 --> 17:57.706
I'm starting to think that
this isn't gonna work out

17:57.740 --> 17:59.401
the way
we want it to.

17:59.440 --> 18:01.271
You can't think
like that.

18:01.310 --> 18:03.107
We will figure this out.

18:03.150 --> 18:06.142
Even if we figure this out,
no one is gonna believe us.

18:06.180 --> 18:08.410
I wouldn't believe the story
that's happening to me.

18:08.450 --> 18:09.815
You can't lose hope.

18:09.850 --> 18:12.614
The thing I hope for
is for you to stay safe.

18:12.650 --> 18:15.153
That's the only promise
I want you to make.

18:15.190 --> 18:17.579
If things get worse, I want
you to find a way out.

18:17.630 --> 18:18.881
What do you mean out?

18:18.930 --> 18:21.421
Out, away, gone.

18:21.460 --> 18:23.826
I want you to
get on a plane or a boat

18:23.870 --> 18:25.690
and go somewhere
where they can't find you.

18:26.870 --> 18:29.737
Caleb, I can manage
as long as you're safe.

18:29.770 --> 18:33.206
Well,
I'm not gonna do that.

18:33.240 --> 18:35.208
Well, that's what
I want you to do.

18:37.850 --> 18:39.249
Promise me.

18:41.350 --> 18:42.908
Well, is the phone number
a dead end or not?

18:42.950 --> 18:44.713
What if it's Mona's
and it's a dead end?

18:44.750 --> 18:47.150
Mona is dead, so who
is the lawyer talking to?

18:48.890 --> 18:50.426
from someone.

18:50.460 --> 18:51.427
You okay?

18:51.460 --> 18:52.722
( cell phone ringing )

18:54.360 --> 18:55.725
Yeah.

18:55.760 --> 18:56.624
Aria.

18:56.660 --> 18:57.866
It's the number.

18:57.900 --> 18:59.390
Look, it's
the Varjack number.

18:59.430 --> 19:00.567
Answer it.

19:00.600 --> 19:01.635
Why does it have
my number?

19:01.670 --> 19:02.568
I never called
from my phone.

19:02.600 --> 19:03.703
Answer it quick.

19:03.740 --> 19:04.866
They don't know
we're here.

19:04.910 --> 19:06.764
We don't have
time for this.

19:06.810 --> 19:08.175
Hello?

19:09.780 --> 19:11.247
( softly)
Who is it?

19:15.320 --> 19:16.469
( turns on speaker)

19:16.520 --> 19:17.919
( song playing
in French )

19:31.500 --> 19:33.297
( song playing
in French )

19:34.670 --> 19:35.694
Are you getting this?

19:35.740 --> 19:36.889
HANNA: I'm getting it.

19:36.940 --> 19:38.464
We don't know
what it means.

19:38.510 --> 19:39.829
HANNA: I know
what it means.

19:39.870 --> 19:41.735
I mean, I don't know
but I've heard it before.

19:41.780 --> 19:43.202
Where?
In Mona's room.

19:43.250 --> 19:44.979
She used to
play this song,

19:45.010 --> 19:47.513
French music from
people like Edith Pilaf.

19:47.550 --> 19:48.949
Like the rice dish?

19:48.980 --> 19:50.584
Piaf, Edith Piaf.

19:50.620 --> 19:52.247
Ali was wrong.

19:52.290 --> 19:54.713
It was never Mona
taunting her, it was "A."

19:54.760 --> 19:56.387
Then why call back
and play that song?

19:56.420 --> 19:58.479
Why not let us keep
thinking it was Mona.

19:58.530 --> 19:59.656
CALEB:
To rub it in our faces.

19:59.690 --> 20:01.248
Well, Mona never
sent that lawyer,

20:01.300 --> 20:02.756
but that doesn't mean
she left us in the dark.

20:02.800 --> 20:04.893
She hid the tape
Hanna found in that book.

20:04.930 --> 20:06.659
The police went
all over that room

20:06.700 --> 20:07.997
and they never
found it.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.962
So?
So maybe there's more.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.934
Maybe the answer
is just still in that room.

20:11.970 --> 20:13.835
We have to get back
to Mona's room.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.508
Hanna, you spent more time
in that room than any of us,

20:16.540 --> 20:17.746
so try to think
about places

20:17.780 --> 20:18.906
that Mona would
have hid stuff.

20:18.950 --> 20:19.905
Okay.

20:19.950 --> 20:21.645
We need to talk
to Mona's mom.

20:21.680 --> 20:22.942
But she wasn't
at the trial.

20:22.980 --> 20:24.641
It's got to be
hard to hear

20:24.690 --> 20:25.918
people talk about
your dead daughter.

20:25.950 --> 20:27.554
Guys, if there's something
in that room

20:27.590 --> 20:28.955
that can get me
out of here,

20:28.990 --> 20:30.958
I don't care how
upset she is, just find it.

20:30.990 --> 20:31.786
We'll do it.

20:31.830 --> 20:33.422
( phone beeping )

20:33.460 --> 20:34.950
That's me. They're
gonna cut me off.

20:35.000 --> 20:35.955
Hang on.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.592
Hanna, stay strong.
We love you.

20:37.630 --> 20:39.689
( phone disconnects )

20:43.410 --> 20:44.900
Here.

20:44.940 --> 20:47.033
Sorry for grabbing it
from you.

20:47.070 --> 20:48.628
It's okay.

20:48.680 --> 20:49.874
No, it's not.

20:49.910 --> 20:51.502
_ If we start
stepping on each other,

20:51.550 --> 20:52.903
none of us are gonna
make it out alive.

20:53.880 --> 20:55.518
Should we go see
Mona's mom?

20:55.550 --> 20:56.642
Not all at once.

20:56.680 --> 20:58.341
That's just
gonna scare her.

20:58.390 --> 20:59.914
I'll go do it.

20:59.950 --> 21:01.781
Well, I'm the least
intimidating.

21:01.820 --> 21:03.287
I'll drive you.

21:05.030 --> 21:06.383
Spence.

21:09.760 --> 21:10.966
I'll call
you guys later.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.968
Okay.

21:17.810 --> 21:19.038
I should _have
put Hanna in a car

21:19.070 --> 21:20.606
and taken off
when I had the chance.

21:20.640 --> 21:21.868
Why didn't you?

21:21.910 --> 21:24.344
She would never leave
you and Ana and Em.

21:24.380 --> 21:27.315
You guys are like
a band of Vikings.

21:27.350 --> 21:30.649
Well, less pillaging,
better hygiene.

21:34.490 --> 21:37.379
She told me to get out
before it got too late.

21:37.430 --> 21:39.489
She said it to me but
I think that she meant it

21:39.530 --> 21:41.020
for all of us.

21:41.060 --> 21:43.620
Do you have any idea how hard
that must have been for her

21:43.670 --> 21:44.967
to say that to you?

21:46.700 --> 21:47.962
The point is she said it.

21:48.000 --> 21:50.901
Are you thinking about it?

21:52.940 --> 21:54.407
No.

21:56.810 --> 21:57.902
You know,
when all of this is over

21:57.950 --> 21:59.599
and we are safe
and sound,

21:59.650 --> 22:01.572
I need to talk
about bottling you.

22:01.620 --> 22:04.714
"Essence of best boyfriend,"
we're gonna make a fortune.

22:07.790 --> 22:11.521
Have you talked to Toby
since you got back?

22:11.560 --> 22:15.326
It's not really a good idea
under the circumstances.

22:17.900 --> 22:19.925
Finish your cookie.

22:32.480 --> 22:33.970
No answer.

22:34.020 --> 22:36.079
Do you really think
there's something up there,

22:36.120 --> 22:37.781
or are we just
chasing smoke?

22:37.820 --> 22:39.117
I don't know.

22:39.150 --> 22:42.017
But whatever Mona was,
she wasn't stupid.

22:42.060 --> 22:43.618
So if she knew
what might happen,

22:43.660 --> 22:44.820
she could have
left us a clue.

22:44.860 --> 22:46.487
If, might, could.

22:46.530 --> 22:48.395
That's all we've got.

22:48.430 --> 22:50.091
Well, what if
it's not enough?

22:50.130 --> 22:51.893
We're running out of time,
we're all gonna get

22:51.930 --> 22:53.431
dragged down
the rabbit hole with Ali.

22:53.470 --> 22:56.439
Do you want to just
give up and go shopping?

22:59.840 --> 23:01.478
Not just yet.

23:18.490 --> 23:19.457
Hi.

23:19.490 --> 23:20.752
Hi.

23:20.800 --> 23:22.859
Just wanted to apologize
for earlier,

23:22.900 --> 23:24.925
about my dad
outside the office.

23:25.900 --> 23:27.197
That's okay.

23:27.230 --> 23:29.869
Still a pretty clear
path through there

23:29.900 --> 23:31.629
between our houses.

23:31.670 --> 23:34.639
Yeah, well there's been a lot
of traffic over the years.

23:34.680 --> 23:36.136
Guess that's how you knew
she'd come this way

23:36.180 --> 23:38.045
when she ran.

23:38.080 --> 23:40.139
Is that how you trapped
her for the police?

23:42.180 --> 23:44.580
I really wish
that we hadn't.

23:44.620 --> 23:46.679
I let her go.

23:46.720 --> 23:47.812
I let her run away.

23:47.860 --> 23:50.078
Why do you think
I did that?

23:52.860 --> 23:53.929
Maybe you thought
there was a chance

23:53.960 --> 23:55.621
she was telling
the truth.

23:55.660 --> 23:56.888
( scoffs )

23:56.930 --> 23:58.466
That's a funny thing
for you to say.

23:58.500 --> 24:00.934
Jason, I made
a terrible mistake.

24:00.970 --> 24:03.632
No, I made
the mistake, Spencer.

24:03.670 --> 24:05.535
I listened to you.

24:15.680 --> 24:17.910
I don't think this is gonna
come as any surprise to you,

24:17.950 --> 24:20.714
but I can be really
certain about things.

24:20.760 --> 24:23.058
Not a surprise.

24:23.090 --> 24:24.523
I like being certain.

24:24.560 --> 24:25.982
Okay, it's where
I'm comfortable.

24:26.030 --> 24:28.225
I-I'm-I'm not happy
in the grey places,

24:28.260 --> 24:29.921
so sometimes
I go to the shore

24:29.960 --> 24:31.097
when I know
that I shouldn't.

24:31.130 --> 24:32.961
And there's
somebody out there

24:33.000 --> 24:34.934
who knows that about me, and
they're doing a very good job

24:34.970 --> 24:37.029
of using it against me.

24:38.010 --> 24:40.467
Nobody likes
the grey places.

24:44.880 --> 24:47.201
I don't think
Alison killed anybody.

24:50.320 --> 24:52.049
Jason?

24:52.090 --> 24:54.251
I got a call from
the prosecutor's office.

24:54.290 --> 24:55.689
They're shuffling
the witness list.

24:55.720 --> 24:57.551
I'm testifying
tomorrow.

25:18.210 --> 25:19.973
If I hadn't stopped
to write this,

25:20.010 --> 25:21.944
I would have been able
to make a clean getaway.

25:21.980 --> 25:23.242
Where do you think
you're going?

25:24.290 --> 25:26.246
Mom, I'm going
to Alison's trial.

25:26.290 --> 25:27.587
I forbid it.

25:27.620 --> 25:28.951
Forbid?

25:28.990 --> 25:31.857
That's a big hefty
19th century word.

25:31.890 --> 25:34.256
Spencer,
please, don't go.

25:34.300 --> 25:36.120
I'm sorry.

25:36.160 --> 25:37.866
I can't do what you're asking
me to do, I have to go.

25:37.900 --> 25:39.128
If they see you
there...

25:39.170 --> 25:40.728
If people are
gonna talk about me,

25:40.770 --> 25:42.567
I'm not gonna let them
do it behind my back.

25:42.600 --> 25:45.160
And being afraid isn't going
to make things better.

25:56.620 --> 25:58.281
( screaming )

26:02.390 --> 26:05.279
( crowd murmurs )

26:05.330 --> 26:07.924
Is this the video
the police showed you?

26:09.200 --> 26:10.622
Yes.

26:10.670 --> 26:12.626
After you saw it,
did you tell the police

26:12.670 --> 26:14.160
of your sister
Alison's whereabouts

26:14.200 --> 26:15.997
on the day that
Mona Vanderwaal

26:16.040 --> 26:17.928
was attacked?

26:17.970 --> 26:21.007
I said that
she wasn't with us.

26:21.040 --> 26:23.008
Why have you decided
to tell the truth

26:23.040 --> 26:25.247
about Alison's alibi?

26:28.880 --> 26:30.177
I don't know.

26:31.350 --> 26:34.786
Was it because of something
you saw on the video?

26:34.820 --> 26:35.957
I don't think so.

26:35.990 --> 26:37.878
Something's wrong.

26:37.930 --> 26:39.727
He's changing
his story.

26:41.030 --> 26:42.725
Didn't you tell
Detective Tanner

26:42.760 --> 26:46.093
that you thought the attacker
in the video was Alison?

26:46.130 --> 26:49.065
I might have said that, yes,
but I don't believe that now.

26:49.100 --> 26:50.829
( crowd murmurs )

26:50.870 --> 26:52.030
You told police...

26:52.070 --> 26:53.207
I've been thinking
and I'm sure

26:53.240 --> 26:55.128
that couldn't
have been Alison.

27:06.050 --> 27:07.984
Mr. DiLaurentis...

27:09.790 --> 27:12.384
do you know a girl
named Hanna Marin?

27:12.430 --> 27:13.385
Objection.

27:13.430 --> 27:14.749
Irrelevant.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.222
ROBSON: Where_are
we gomg, Mr. Sirk?

27:16.260 --> 27:18.296
Your Honor,
the witness has confirmed

27:18.330 --> 27:19.968
that the defendant
doesn't have an alibi.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.228
That's fact.

27:21.270 --> 27:22.965
I would like
the jury to understand

27:23.000 --> 27:26.709
what may have influenced his
identification of the attacker.

27:26.740 --> 27:28.139
Counselor?

27:28.180 --> 27:30.205
Your Honor, if Mr. Sirk
wants to cross-examine

27:30.240 --> 27:32.800
his own witness,
I have no objection.

27:32.850 --> 27:34.738
Proceed.

27:34.780 --> 27:37.988
Do you know
Hanna Marin?

27:38.020 --> 27:39.385
Yes.

27:39.420 --> 27:41.081
SIRK: Is she a friend
of your sister Alison?

27:41.120 --> 27:43.680
JASON: Yes.

27:43.730 --> 27:45.083
Who is Ashley Marin?

27:45.130 --> 27:46.256
Hanna's mother.

27:46.290 --> 27:47.382
Objection.
Irrelevant.

27:47.430 --> 27:49.091
SIRK:
Goes to foundation.

27:49.130 --> 27:50.449
Overruled.

27:50.500 --> 27:52.718
But don't take
the scenic route, Mr. Sirk.

27:52.770 --> 27:55.364
_ Is Mrs. Marin
in the courtroom today?

27:55.400 --> 27:57.231
Yes.

27:57.270 --> 27:59.204
Poin_t her out
to the jury, please.

28:01.910 --> 28:03.036
She's in the third row.

28:03.080 --> 28:05.048
She's wearing
a blue dress.

28:09.350 --> 28:12.319
Does Mrs. Marin
work for you?

28:12.350 --> 28:14.853
She did,
she doesn't anymore.

28:14.890 --> 28:17.108
Did you have occasion
to meet with her

28:17.160 --> 28:19.185
outside of the office?

28:20.290 --> 28:21.120
Yes.

28:21.160 --> 28:23.321
Socially?

28:25.130 --> 28:26.768
JASON: Yes.

28:26.800 --> 28:30.463
How many times have
you been with her socially?

28:30.500 --> 28:32.331
That's...

28:34.480 --> 28:36.004
I didn't count.

28:36.040 --> 28:37.268
These social meetings,

28:37.310 --> 28:39.198
were they always
in public places?

28:39.250 --> 28:41.172
JASON: Most of them.

28:41.220 --> 28:42.915
SIRK:
But not all of them.

28:42.950 --> 28:44.747
Some were in private.

28:44.790 --> 28:46.018
Yes.

28:46.050 --> 28:47.381
Is he saying
what I think he's saying?

28:47.420 --> 28:48.512
Seriously?

28:48.560 --> 28:50.414
SIRK: How would you characterize
these private meetings?

28:50.460 --> 28:52.781
Sorry, I don't think
I understand the question.

28:52.830 --> 28:55.822
Well, would you
describe them as intimate?

28:57.800 --> 28:59.199
They were private.

28:59.230 --> 29:01.790
Did anything happen during
these private meetings

29:01.840 --> 29:04.206
with the attractive woman
seated in the gallery

29:04.240 --> 29:06.060
that led you to alter
your testimony?

29:06.110 --> 29:07.509
No.

29:07.540 --> 29:10.475
Did Ashley Marin,
the mother of someone accused

29:10.510 --> 29:12.148
as an accomplice
to this crime,

29:12.180 --> 29:14.011
offer any personal
inducement to you

29:14.050 --> 29:17.042
to change your testimony
to favor the defense?

29:17.080 --> 29:19.139
Objection.
Asked and answered.

29:19.190 --> 29:20.953
Sustained.
Move on, Mr. Sirk.

29:20.990 --> 29:22.389
Last chance,
Mr. DiLaurentis.

29:22.420 --> 29:24.183
Do you want to
clear this up,

29:24.230 --> 29:25.857
_ or leave it_ to _
the jury's imagination?

29:25.890 --> 29:27.152
Objection.

29:27.190 --> 29:28.851
Improper, inflammatory,
irrelevant.

29:28.900 --> 29:30.356
Sustained.

29:30.400 --> 29:33.324
Do you have any other
questions for this witness?

29:36.070 --> 29:38.106
Nothing further.

29:38.140 --> 29:41.268
( crowd murmurs )

29:51.190 --> 29:52.418
Do you think
Hanna knew about this?

29:52.450 --> 29:53.587
She did.

29:53.620 --> 29:55.554
And it looks like
"A" knew about it, too.

29:55.590 --> 29:56.989
Well, what happened in there
hurt Ali, didn't it?

29:57.020 --> 29:58.556
Yeah.

29:58.590 --> 30:00.387
It made it sound like her
own brother thinks she did it.

30:00.430 --> 30:03.058
Until Hanna's mom_convinced
him to change his story.

30:03.100 --> 30:05.227
Do you think
that's what she did?

30:05.270 --> 30:06.396
Hanna's mom?

30:06.430 --> 30:08.159
Hold on.

30:10.940 --> 30:13.135
Jason?

30:13.170 --> 30:14.535
Are you all right?

30:14.580 --> 30:17.879
Ask me after I find
a place to sleep tonight.

30:18.580 --> 30:20.172
You
and Hanna's mom...

30:20.210 --> 30:21.916
It's none of your
business, Spencer.

30:21.950 --> 30:23.144
It's nobody's business.

30:23.180 --> 30:24.283
No, you're right.

30:24.320 --> 30:25.878
It's not.

30:25.920 --> 30:27.547
If you really
need a place to stay...

30:27.590 --> 30:28.557
It's okay.

30:28.590 --> 30:30.353
I'll figure
something out.

30:35.460 --> 30:36.927
Cross your fingers
and wish hard

30:36.960 --> 30:38.894
that you never have
to sit in that chair.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.433
You won't like it.

30:46.070 --> 30:47.332
What did
he say?

30:50.340 --> 30:51.546
The truth
will set you free

30:51.580 --> 30:53.468
but first it turns
you InSIde out.

30:54.980 --> 30:55.969
Come on.

30:56.020 --> 30:56.975
Where?

30:57.020 --> 30:58.385
Mona's house.

31:05.390 --> 31:06.618
Well, you were right.

31:06.660 --> 31:08.457
I shouldn't have
gone to the trial.

31:10.630 --> 31:12.325
I don't think it would have
made much of a difference

31:12.370 --> 31:13.894
if you'd stayed away.

31:15.540 --> 31:17.292
( cell phone ringing )

31:21.010 --> 31:22.272
( beeps )

31:23.640 --> 31:25.642
You might as well
start answering that.

31:26.710 --> 31:28.246
It can keep.

31:31.720 --> 31:35.087
You're gonna have to talk
to someone sooner or later.

31:35.120 --> 31:36.382
If they haven't heard
already,

31:36.420 --> 31:37.921
they're going to hear it
on the news.

31:37.960 --> 31:40.485
_Most of the ladies
in the congregation

31:40.530 --> 31:43.522
manage to pull the news
straight out of the atmosphere.

31:44.430 --> 31:46.398
It's really amazing.

31:51.010 --> 31:52.409
You can go, Ted.

31:53.740 --> 31:56.072
I just want to
finish my coffee first.

31:56.110 --> 31:57.975
No, I mean...

31:58.010 --> 31:59.546
you can go.

32:02.020 --> 32:03.271
It's all right.

32:03.320 --> 32:06.312
I'm not going
anywhere.

32:06.350 --> 32:10.650
I'm not being noble,
I'm being practical.

32:12.560 --> 32:14.289
I made a promise
to you.

32:14.330 --> 32:16.355
And believe me,
there is a time

32:16.400 --> 32:18.994
when I would have
held you to that but...

32:19.030 --> 32:20.292
not now.

32:20.330 --> 32:23.959
It's not a way
to start a life together.

32:24.010 --> 32:25.261
We can get through this.

32:25.310 --> 32:27.460
Yes, we can.

32:27.510 --> 32:29.307
And then what?

32:30.540 --> 32:32.405
We are
who we are, Ted.

32:32.450 --> 32:35.647
I never asked you
to explain.

32:36.450 --> 32:38.111
You should have.

32:39.750 --> 32:42.014
What's the point of forgiveness
if you don't know

32:42.060 --> 32:43.550
what really happened?

32:43.590 --> 32:45.683
It's about
a clean slate.

32:48.130 --> 32:49.427
There is no such thing.

32:50.630 --> 32:52.427
I'm beginning to think
that's the way

32:52.470 --> 32:54.062
it was supposed to be.

32:57.040 --> 32:59.065
Thank you.

33:00.770 --> 33:02.408
But you should go.

33:05.710 --> 33:07.541
I'll just
finish my coffee.

33:08.650 --> 33:10.049
Okay?

33:17.560 --> 33:19.084
Do you think
she's in there?

33:21.530 --> 33:23.589
Mrs. Vanderwaal!

33:27.070 --> 33:29.129
Okay, she's not here, she wasn't
at the trial, where is she?

33:29.170 --> 33:30.194
She's hiding.

33:30.240 --> 33:31.639
I don't blame her.

33:31.670 --> 33:33.604
Okay,
it was a long shot.

33:33.640 --> 33:36.507
Long shots
are all we have.

33:36.540 --> 33:38.405
We should try
and get to Hanna.

33:42.250 --> 33:45.139
( French music playing )

34:22.620 --> 34:24.258
Well,
it was a good idea.

34:24.290 --> 34:28.556
( record crackles and pops )

34:31.270 --> 34:32.521
( sighs )

34:38.710 --> 34:41.304
"Finders keepers,
losers weepers."

34:41.340 --> 34:42.807
Quelle tristesse.

34:42.840 --> 34:44.774
"A."

34:44.810 --> 34:47.108
You_r accent's
getting better.

34:48.250 --> 34:49.478
( sighs )

34:49.520 --> 34:51.886
Wait.
What?

34:51.920 --> 34:54.354
How would you stop someone
from searching your room?

34:54.390 --> 34:55.812
What do you mean?

34:55.860 --> 34:57.316
Why do we think that
"A" found something

34:57.360 --> 34:59.453
just because
"A" said so?

34:59.490 --> 35:01.299
The note was written
to taunt us.

35:01.330 --> 35:03.218
Or trick us.

35:04.300 --> 35:05.665
Think like Mona.

35:06.930 --> 35:08.761
Just for a minute.

35:12.470 --> 35:14.131
IfI were Mona...

36:21.940 --> 36:23.703
* We stay up all night...

36:23.740 --> 36:25.640
What the hell
is a chandelier ritual?

36:25.680 --> 36:26.977
I have no idea.

36:27.010 --> 36:29.877
Let me change,
I think better in lower heels.

36:29.920 --> 36:31.547
Okay.

36:32.920 --> 36:34.785
Aria?

36:34.820 --> 36:36.959
I didn't want you
getting the wrong idea.

36:36.990 --> 36:38.651
About what?

36:38.690 --> 36:40.783
I've been thinking,
and I realize

36:40.830 --> 36:42.991
I made a really bad impression
what I said about Mona.

36:43.030 --> 36:45.464
Look.
Everything about Mona
was complicated.

36:45.500 --> 36:46.660
Yeah.

36:46.700 --> 36:47.769
But when I said that
about her,

36:47.800 --> 36:49.438
I saw the look
on your face.

36:49.470 --> 36:52.906
And it wasn't the way
I want to see you look at me...

36:52.940 --> 36:54.009
ever.

36:54.040 --> 36:55.803
It's just my face.

36:55.840 --> 36:58.604
Sometimes it does things
without checking with me first.

36:59.450 --> 37:00.747
Well, it sounded like

37:00.780 --> 37:02.372
she deserved
what happened to her,

37:02.420 --> 37:03.409
and I don't
believe that.

37:03.450 --> 37:05.315
Yeah.
Nobody does.

37:06.350 --> 37:07.715
It was bothering me.

37:07.750 --> 37:09.456
Just wanted to make sure
we're clear on this.

37:09.490 --> 37:10.980
Yeah, we're clear.

37:11.020 --> 37:13.022
And if you need me
for anything,

37:13.060 --> 37:14.698
cramming for an exam

37:14.730 --> 37:16.857
or driving out to some
road house,

37:16.900 --> 37:18.663
you've got me
on speed dial, right?

37:18.700 --> 37:19.724
Yeah.
Right.

37:19.770 --> 37:22.989
Okay.
I feel better.

37:25.610 --> 37:27.339
I guess I surprised
your face again, huh?

37:28.610 --> 37:31.909
It's okay.
I'll call you.
Okay.

37:31.950 --> 37:36.444
* You say you want
to know... *

37:36.480 --> 37:38.948
* Never try

37:38.990 --> 37:40.343
I'm sorry.

37:41.790 --> 37:44.623
This is all my fault.

37:45.690 --> 37:47.681
I'm the one who should be
saying sorry.

37:47.730 --> 37:48.992
For what?

37:49.030 --> 37:50.725
For being human?

37:51.800 --> 37:54.394
I'm sorry I gave you
such a hard time.

37:56.800 --> 37:58.028
Awful lot of mistakes,
Hanna.

37:58.070 --> 38:01.005
I have made
so many mistakes.

38:01.040 --> 38:02.871
It'll be okay.

38:02.910 --> 38:06.277
Whatever happens,
we'll be okay.

38:08.550 --> 38:09.812
I'm supposed to be
saying that to you.

38:09.850 --> 38:11.408
It's not gonna be
that bad.

38:11.450 --> 38:14.613
I mean, maybe
I'll write a book or something.

38:14.660 --> 38:16.651
Lots of people
write books in prison.

38:16.690 --> 38:18.328
Martha Stewart
wrote one.

38:20.730 --> 38:21.856
I just hope
you didn't get

38:21.900 --> 38:23.652
the bad decision gene
from me.

38:23.700 --> 38:26.726
Well, I hope I did.

38:26.770 --> 38:28.761
I hope I got
all of your DNA in me.

38:28.800 --> 38:31.530
That means I'll be smart
and I'll be brave

38:31.570 --> 38:33.106
and I'll sing
my daughter

38:33.140 --> 38:35.938
the best lullabies
when she's scared.

38:39.680 --> 38:41.739
Do you know
how much I love you?

38:41.780 --> 38:46.046
Yeah,
I think I do.

38:53.790 --> 38:55.758
We're
quite the pair.

38:56.800 --> 38:59.428
A|| lying
is a one way street.

39:00.700 --> 39:03.567
It's kind of like those
signs in parking lots.

39:03.600 --> 39:06.034
"Backing up causes
severe tire damage."

39:10.110 --> 39:12.044
What does your lawyer
think?

39:13.650 --> 39:15.538
She remains confident,

39:15.580 --> 39:18.743
except when she doesn't know
that I'm looking at her.

39:19.720 --> 39:21.483
Is there anything
I can do?

39:22.720 --> 39:24.859
You had the right idea
a long time ago.

39:26.060 --> 39:27.379
Get out.

39:28.900 --> 39:30.629
Just leave, Jason.

39:30.660 --> 39:32.059
Do it now.

39:34.900 --> 39:36.458
I believe you, Ali.

39:38.540 --> 39:39.962
I believed you since
that night at the house

39:40.010 --> 39:41.637
when you tried
to get away.

39:41.680 --> 39:44.376
I saw it in your face,
you didn't kill anyone.

39:45.710 --> 39:47.007
No.

39:48.450 --> 39:51.112
But I let a lot of things happen
that I shouldn't have.

40:03.200 --> 40:05.088
( door opening )

40:51.810 --> 40:53.801
WOMAN 1: Itook money
from my mom's purse

40:53.850 --> 40:55.215
and she thought
it was my brother

40:55.250 --> 40:56.842
and that's
who got punished.

40:56.880 --> 40:59.189
This was
20, 25 years ago.

41:00.920 --> 41:02.615
WOMAN 2:
The broken headlight,

41:02.660 --> 41:04.252
I did that, I think.

41:04.290 --> 41:07.179
I don't remember
much of that night.

41:07.230 --> 41:08.891
WOMAN 3:
Oh, I hate my boobs,

41:08.930 --> 41:11.091
they're like
a complete joke.

41:13.170 --> 41:14.831
MAN:
The dog didn't run away,

41:14.870 --> 41:17.031
I left the gate open
on purpose.

41:19.670 --> 41:21.877
( song playing in French )

41:31.720 --> 41:34.109
( song playing in French )

41:47.930 --> 41:50.933
* So when we meet

41:50.970 --> 41:54.235
* Under Paris skies

41:54.270 --> 41:57.933
* And the girls
will dance

41:57.980 --> 42:01.643
* As the crowds
go by *

42:01.680 --> 42:06.549
* Lov_ers will
always find love *

42:06.590 --> 42:08.148
(Tippi whistling )

42:08.190 --> 42:14.026
( song continues in French )
