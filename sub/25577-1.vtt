01:05.558 --> 01:09.393
Okay, testing,
one, two, testing.

01:09.395 --> 01:10.927
Puh, puh.

01:10.929 --> 01:12.465
Buh, buh.

01:12.998 --> 01:14.030
Alright.

01:23.876 --> 01:26.510
Welcome to Shadowlands,
where the veil

01:26.512 --> 01:29.446
between reality and
myth is pulled aside,

01:29.448 --> 01:31.582
leaving only the truth.

01:31.584 --> 01:34.050
Today is my hundredth
episode and to celebrate

01:34.052 --> 01:36.353
this milestone, I am on location

01:36.355 --> 01:38.455
with a very special guest.

01:38.457 --> 01:40.757
Across from me is
a legendary lawman,

01:40.759 --> 01:42.726
the Sheriff of Bear Claw County

01:42.728 --> 01:45.396
for almost five years,
Randall Reynolds.

01:45.398 --> 01:47.030
Welcome, sir.

01:47.032 --> 01:48.233
Miss.

01:49.134 --> 01:50.567
I'd like to jump
right in, both feet,

01:50.569 --> 01:51.902
just go for it.

01:51.904 --> 01:53.904
Is that cool with you?

01:53.906 --> 01:55.572
That's what we're here for.

01:55.574 --> 01:57.674
Fans of the show
know that 10 years ago,

01:57.676 --> 01:59.810
the Bear Claw Mountain
Wilderness Area

01:59.812 --> 02:01.712
was the site of one
of the bloodiest

02:01.714 --> 02:04.014
events in paranormal history.

02:04.016 --> 02:06.483
12 people were
brutally mutilated

02:06.485 --> 02:10.454
in what the press dubbed
The Bear Claw Massacre.

02:10.455 --> 02:11.755
How does it feel,
Sheriff, to be one

02:11.757 --> 02:13.992
of the few lucky survivors?

02:15.761 --> 02:17.561
I lost my right hand.

02:17.563 --> 02:19.630
My pelvis was crushed.

02:19.632 --> 02:21.865
I almost bled to death
crawling to the local highway

02:21.867 --> 02:24.403
after my encounter with that

02:25.504 --> 02:26.505
thing.

02:28.874 --> 02:31.942
I don't know if I'd
call that lucky.

02:31.944 --> 02:34.611
I'm sorry for all you
suffered through, Sheriff,

02:34.613 --> 02:37.013
but I'm a little confused.

02:37.015 --> 02:39.583
In your official police
report, you claimed that

02:39.585 --> 02:42.419
all the murders were
committed by a rabid

02:42.421 --> 02:45.856
grizzly bear which you
dispatched with your firearm.

02:45.858 --> 02:48.625
I claimed no such thing.

02:48.627 --> 02:51.029
But isn't this your report?

02:53.466 --> 02:56.633
That is some piece
of shit fairy tale

02:56.635 --> 03:00.103
written up by the
Mayor's Office.

03:00.105 --> 03:02.441
But that's your signature.

03:04.543 --> 03:06.042
I stuck to the truth
as long as I could

03:06.044 --> 03:08.512
until they threatened to ship me

03:08.514 --> 03:12.583
to the state mental
hospital in Warm Springs.

03:12.585 --> 03:14.353
Nobody believed me.

03:15.421 --> 03:18.489
I was beat to hell
and I was just

03:18.491 --> 03:20.025
so tired of fighting.

03:24.597 --> 03:27.698
So, in the end, I went
along with their little plan

03:27.700 --> 03:31.868
because I fought too
hard to keep my pension

03:31.870 --> 03:33.837
and to stay out of the

03:33.839 --> 03:36.172
booby hatch for years.

03:36.174 --> 03:38.775
So, why open up now, Sheriff?

03:38.777 --> 03:42.948
Aren't you still afraid of
what they might do to you?

03:44.483 --> 03:46.483
The Mayor and all
his little cronies

03:46.485 --> 03:47.484
behind the cover up,

03:47.486 --> 03:49.486
they're all long gone.

03:49.488 --> 03:52.491
Also, the town has
had time to heal,

03:53.526 --> 03:55.526
and everyone there
needs to finally know

03:55.528 --> 03:58.795
what really happened
during that time,

03:58.797 --> 04:01.498
but more than anything,
I need to warn

04:01.500 --> 04:04.568
your uh, more curious listeners.

04:04.570 --> 04:07.037
They need to
understand one thing.

04:07.039 --> 04:09.875
Stay away from
Bear Claw Mountain.

04:11.043 --> 04:13.510
Well, Sheriff, the
mike is all yours.

04:13.512 --> 04:15.846
Tell my thousands of
Shadowland subscribers

04:15.848 --> 04:17.850
your eyewitness account.

04:19.485 --> 04:23.456
Well, the trouble started
about fifty years ago.

04:25.157 --> 04:26.557
All the locals knew to keep away

04:26.559 --> 04:28.124
from the south side
of the mountain,

04:28.126 --> 04:32.496
where there was this
unnatural black spring

04:32.498 --> 04:34.565
that flowed through
this toxic waste

04:34.567 --> 04:37.167
and then went out
into the deep woods.

04:37.169 --> 04:39.670
Some charlatan came to
town and had a great idea

04:39.672 --> 04:42.172
to make a couple of
bucks, so he claimed

04:42.174 --> 04:46.545
that the waters actually had
miraculous healing powers.

04:47.680 --> 04:50.481
Well, when people
heard about that,

04:50.483 --> 04:54.117
that's when all the
desperate showed up.

04:54.119 --> 04:57.854
When you got no hope,
you got no fear.

05:25.283 --> 05:26.519
No, no.

05:28.220 --> 05:29.488
Katy, please.

05:39.064 --> 05:40.597
Trust me.

05:40.599 --> 05:42.265
It's the only way.

05:55.614 --> 05:57.015
No, please, no.

06:26.044 --> 06:28.213
Katy, no, that's enough.

06:29.782 --> 06:30.783
No!

07:00.846 --> 07:02.045
Everyone suspected where those

07:02.047 --> 07:05.115
Orderly sisters were headed,

07:05.117 --> 07:08.284
so my Granddad quickly
gathered up a search party,

07:08.286 --> 07:11.688
to cut the girls
off before they,

07:11.690 --> 07:14.292
they could get that evil place.

07:17.262 --> 07:19.262
But they were too late.

07:24.036 --> 07:27.403
Eyes to the ground,
folks, eyes to the ground.

07:27.405 --> 07:28.607
Katy!

07:34.412 --> 07:36.279
Elizabeth!

07:36.281 --> 07:37.313
Katy!

07:37.315 --> 07:39.049
Katy!

07:53.799 --> 07:54.800
Sheriff!

08:09.181 --> 08:11.314
We need to get back
to the trail head

08:11.316 --> 08:13.750
in an orderly manner.

08:13.752 --> 08:14.753
Sheriff?

08:35.173 --> 08:38.342
Alright, everybody,
now move on out!

08:45.350 --> 08:46.651
Oh, shit!

11:32.350 --> 11:33.583
Morning, Jim.

11:33.585 --> 11:35.251
How 'bout we cut the
shit and you tell me

11:35.253 --> 11:37.087
why it is I'm here?

11:37.089 --> 11:40.623
Okay, the results
aren't what we expected.

11:40.625 --> 11:43.896
It's spread to your
lymphatic system.

11:45.397 --> 11:47.030
What about all this
radiation treatment?

11:47.032 --> 11:48.298
You said it would work.

11:48.300 --> 11:49.900
I said chances were good.

11:49.902 --> 11:51.667
You have a very aggressive
malignancy, Jim.

11:51.669 --> 11:53.136
We thought we caught
it early enough

11:53.138 --> 11:55.071
where the treatment could work.

11:55.073 --> 11:57.607
So, this whole thing?

11:57.609 --> 11:59.275
All the money I spent,
it was for nothing?

11:59.277 --> 12:00.276
I can understand your anger.

12:00.278 --> 12:01.413
No, you can't.

12:03.681 --> 12:08.184
I'm gonna die, and there's
nothing you can do about it.

12:08.186 --> 12:09.187
Nothing.

12:53.298 --> 12:54.564
Afternoon, sir.

12:54.566 --> 12:55.567
Hey.

12:56.501 --> 12:57.968
Got a lot of supplies, there.

12:57.970 --> 13:00.036
You headin' on up to
one of the cabins?

13:00.038 --> 13:01.704
Is there a problem, officer?

13:01.706 --> 13:03.606
No, just you got a
lot of food, there,

13:03.608 --> 13:05.208
and bears always like food,

13:05.210 --> 13:06.376
so you should just be careful.

13:06.378 --> 13:07.710
Thank you.

13:07.712 --> 13:08.913
Bears bad.

15:35.427 --> 15:36.428
Ah!

15:39.764 --> 15:40.765
Ah!

15:59.584 --> 16:00.583
Oh shit.

16:00.585 --> 16:01.586
Oh shit.

18:00.037 --> 18:01.036
Yes.

18:01.038 --> 18:02.672
No, I promise you.

18:02.674 --> 18:06.244
We're almost there,
you guys, calm down.

18:12.484 --> 18:13.549
Morning, people.

18:13.551 --> 18:16.419
Welcome to Bear Claw Mountain.

18:16.421 --> 18:19.655
Park officials called the
U.S.G.S. Geological Service

18:19.657 --> 18:23.493
after the earthquake
created surface fissures

18:23.495 --> 18:26.696
and several newly
formed pockets of this,

18:26.698 --> 18:29.399
as yet to be
determined discharge.

18:29.401 --> 18:31.667
Excuse me, but if this
stuff is of an unknown origin,

18:31.669 --> 18:33.636
shouldn't we be issued
some kind of hazmat gear?

18:34.906 --> 18:36.506
Hazmat gear?

18:36.508 --> 18:37.607
This fuckin' guy.

18:37.609 --> 18:39.542
Yeah, it's actually
gear that protects you

18:39.544 --> 18:40.676
from hazardous materials.

18:40.678 --> 18:43.413
Rubber gloves and goggles'll
do just fine for now.

18:43.415 --> 18:46.749
We'll be stationed
down at campsite five.

18:46.751 --> 18:49.785
Well, see you all in
few hours, people.

18:49.787 --> 18:50.920
It's that way.

18:50.922 --> 18:51.921
Let's go, Red.

18:51.923 --> 18:53.423
Get on down to the campsite.

18:53.425 --> 18:55.391
Come on, baby, let
me help you with that.

18:55.393 --> 18:56.426
Okay.

18:56.428 --> 18:57.427
Thanks.

18:57.429 --> 18:58.428
Oh, sorry.

18:58.430 --> 19:00.730
Its all good, uh, George.

19:00.732 --> 19:01.964
Amber.

19:01.966 --> 19:03.766
Nice to meet you.

19:03.768 --> 19:04.936
Hotties first.

19:27.492 --> 19:29.492
Good morning.

19:29.494 --> 19:31.494
I'm so sorry I'm late.

19:31.496 --> 19:33.028
No, it's okay, you're fine.

19:33.030 --> 19:34.029
Come on.

19:34.031 --> 19:35.498
It's not that bad.

19:35.500 --> 19:36.568
Okay.

19:56.654 --> 19:57.822
Who's there?

20:02.627 --> 20:03.628
Jim?

20:09.567 --> 20:11.401
Oh.

20:11.403 --> 20:12.404
Jim.

20:14.406 --> 20:15.638
I don't wanna
hear it, alright?

20:15.640 --> 20:16.772
Jim?

20:16.774 --> 20:18.641
I gave up on remission
a long time ago.

20:18.643 --> 20:20.009
Can't you just let
me die in peace?

20:20.011 --> 20:22.412
Your body is
telling you something.

20:22.414 --> 20:24.880
Tam, if I want a
drink or a cigarette,

20:24.882 --> 20:26.048
it's my business.

20:26.050 --> 20:28.418
I don't need a
fuckin' babysitter.

20:28.420 --> 20:30.420
Honey.

20:30.422 --> 20:31.423
What?

20:32.457 --> 20:33.958
You're standing.

20:38.863 --> 20:40.062
Ah!

20:40.064 --> 20:41.497
Oh, it's a miracle!

20:57.782 --> 21:00.117
Great. Bite your lip for me.

21:09.561 --> 21:10.560
Little more.

21:10.562 --> 21:12.227
Alright.

21:12.229 --> 21:14.564
I gotta go.

21:36.821 --> 21:37.822
Gary?

21:40.758 --> 21:41.759
Hello?

22:01.045 --> 22:02.745
It's okay, calm down.

22:02.747 --> 22:03.848
It's alright.

23:31.302 --> 23:32.303
Shit!

23:45.349 --> 23:47.282
The fuck?

24:14.411 --> 24:15.978
So, I dated this pike
like a year and a half.

24:15.980 --> 24:17.379
Oh, Jesus, those
guys are all dicks.

24:17.381 --> 24:18.247
Such a sleaze, I swear.

24:18.249 --> 24:20.115
He could not keep
his hands off me.

24:20.117 --> 24:22.084
Well, I mean, I
kinda don't blame him.

24:22.086 --> 24:24.353
Well, no, but see,
no respect whatsoever.

24:24.355 --> 24:26.221
Constantly groping me.

24:26.223 --> 24:27.990
What is that?

24:27.992 --> 24:28.993
That, there.

24:48.012 --> 24:49.444
Mmmm, ow, ow, ow.

24:49.446 --> 24:50.445
What?

24:50.447 --> 24:52.650
This isn't gonna work.

25:01.759 --> 25:03.759
- Mmm, slow down.
- Why?

25:03.761 --> 25:05.795
Because I hardly know you.

25:05.797 --> 25:07.196
What's the matter?

25:07.198 --> 25:08.199
I like you.

25:09.834 --> 25:11.168
And you like me.

25:12.369 --> 25:14.069
What else is there to know?

25:14.071 --> 25:15.905
Your last name, for one thing.

25:15.907 --> 25:16.908
Lister.

25:17.742 --> 25:19.241
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

25:19.243 --> 25:21.076
Your name is George Lister?

25:21.078 --> 25:23.178
Yeah, so what?

25:23.180 --> 25:25.014
I have rushed
with Carrie Tamlin.

25:25.016 --> 25:26.081
Carrie's a total cock tease.

25:26.083 --> 25:28.050
What ever she says, it's a lie.

25:28.052 --> 25:30.219
Lister the Fister?

25:30.221 --> 25:31.353
I don't think so.

25:31.355 --> 25:32.354
Come on.

25:32.356 --> 25:34.225
Where are you going?

25:35.359 --> 25:36.961
Oh, Jesus Christ.

25:40.464 --> 25:41.665
Wait up!

25:47.304 --> 25:50.072
Ance, have you
ever put a tent up before?

25:50.074 --> 25:52.007
Of course.
I used to be a Boy Scout.

25:52.009 --> 25:55.144
- Oh, you did?
- Eagle Scout, yeah.

25:55.146 --> 25:57.112
How'd it go, sweetie?

25:57.114 --> 25:59.416
I don't wanna talk about it.

26:01.418 --> 26:04.954
Great, I'm missing a support.

26:04.956 --> 26:09.825
Do they, uh, look a
little something like these?

26:09.827 --> 26:11.293
Exactly like that.

26:11.295 --> 26:12.329
Thanks.

26:15.933 --> 26:17.432
Guys, listen to this.

26:17.434 --> 26:21.370
23 dead or missing in Bear
Claw Mountain Massacre.

26:21.372 --> 26:22.838
Mike, do you
wanna maybe help us

26:22.840 --> 26:24.506
set up camp at all today?

26:24.508 --> 26:26.208
Listen to this.

26:26.210 --> 26:27.810
Eyewitness accounts claim
that the victims were killed

26:27.812 --> 26:32.014
by a man-beast eight feet
tall and black as coal.

26:32.016 --> 26:35.350
Local mountain men called
it The Shadow of Death.

26:35.352 --> 26:37.119
How cool is that?

26:37.121 --> 26:38.790
Dude, it just, dude.

26:42.059 --> 26:43.995
Hey, that was not cool.

26:45.562 --> 26:47.496
This isn't a toy, man.

26:47.498 --> 26:49.333
My mom bought me this.

26:50.567 --> 26:52.968
Besides, I'm a man
of science, Mike.

26:52.970 --> 26:55.437
I don't have time for your
superstitious folklore.

26:55.439 --> 26:57.406
Oh, folklore, excuse me?

26:57.408 --> 27:00.242
That was the front page
of the Bozeman Herald.

27:00.244 --> 27:03.913
Guys, something killed 23
people 100 years ago right here.

27:03.915 --> 27:05.981
Something like a bear, maybe.

27:05.983 --> 27:09.218
Pretty hard to imagine
on Bear Claw Mountain.

27:09.220 --> 27:10.352
You know what the
problem is here is,

27:10.354 --> 27:14.926
you three guys, together,
you have zero imagination.

27:25.837 --> 27:28.603
Even your reflection
makes me wanna vomit.

27:28.605 --> 27:30.305
I said I was sorry.

27:30.307 --> 27:31.974
We didn't mean for it
to happen, alright?

27:31.976 --> 27:34.376
Oh, yeah that makes it
all okay, you fucking dick.

27:34.378 --> 27:35.945
Please, Donna, okay?

27:35.947 --> 27:37.179
What's done is done.

27:37.181 --> 27:38.480
Right now we have to
think about the baby.

27:38.482 --> 27:40.282
Fuck your baby.

27:40.284 --> 27:42.317
Let's talk about your
need to fuck my husband.

27:42.319 --> 27:44.553
Oh, gee, for
fuck's sake, okay?

27:44.555 --> 27:46.488
It's like, are you ever
gonna get over this?

27:46.490 --> 27:47.857
Ah, lemme think.

27:47.859 --> 27:49.324
Are you fucking stupid?

27:49.326 --> 27:50.459
You don't have to yell.

27:50.461 --> 27:52.294
We can both hear you, alright?

27:52.296 --> 27:53.095
I'm not yelling.

27:53.097 --> 27:54.964
Who's yelling,
you fucking cock...

27:58.169 --> 27:59.234
What the fuck did you do?

27:59.236 --> 28:00.903
I hit something, okay?

28:00.905 --> 28:02.004
It's hard to concentrate when

28:02.006 --> 28:03.638
you two psychos keep fighting.

28:03.640 --> 28:05.307
No, no, no don't
even bring it up to me.

28:05.309 --> 28:07.042
It's your fuckin'
dumb cunt in the back.

28:07.044 --> 28:08.277
You're such a fuckin' asshole.

28:08.279 --> 28:09.444
I didn't do fuckin' anything...

28:09.446 --> 28:10.445
Oh, you never do anything...

28:10.447 --> 28:11.446
Would you just shut up?

28:11.448 --> 28:12.481
You fat bitch.

28:12.483 --> 28:13.983
Just shut up.

28:13.985 --> 28:15.050
Shut up!

28:15.052 --> 28:16.053
Shut up!

28:16.553 --> 28:19.588
And let me take care of this.

28:19.590 --> 28:21.323
Then get the fuck out
and take care of it.

28:21.325 --> 28:23.094
No shit, you fag.

28:31.368 --> 28:33.404
Do not do that shit!

28:59.396 --> 29:00.629
I just wanna get the
fuck out of here.

29:00.631 --> 29:02.566
Oh, shut the fuck up.

29:04.201 --> 29:05.634
You know, why don't you
stop pretending to be a man

29:05.636 --> 29:08.472
and let's just call a tow truck.

29:09.706 --> 29:12.107
I swear to God, this is
the worst fucking trip ever.

29:12.109 --> 29:13.577
I can't handle this.

29:15.446 --> 29:16.981
- Jake.
- Jake.

30:30.454 --> 30:32.254
I don't get you.

30:32.256 --> 30:33.422
You want me to be positive,

30:33.424 --> 30:35.490
and then I have a breakthrough

30:35.492 --> 30:38.193
and you want me to
be afraid again?

30:38.195 --> 30:41.565
If I'm curious, it's
just because I care.

30:43.334 --> 30:46.501
You're just gonna
think I'm crazy.

30:46.503 --> 30:47.671
No, I won't.

31:00.417 --> 31:03.352
When I fell into
that black mud,

31:03.354 --> 31:06.355
I swallowed enough
of that shit to die.

31:11.395 --> 31:14.396
Dragged all that, all
that sickness out of me.

31:14.398 --> 31:15.530
All that filthy
shit is gone, now.

31:15.532 --> 31:16.533
I can just,

31:17.601 --> 31:19.401
I can feel it.

31:44.161 --> 31:47.862
No, no, no, what
I need is more time.

31:47.864 --> 31:48.863
What the fuck do
you want from me?

31:48.865 --> 31:50.401
I just got here.

31:53.370 --> 31:55.372
I don't care about that.

31:56.407 --> 31:59.776
We're so low profile,
no one will ever know.

32:01.478 --> 32:03.878
What I need is a week.

32:03.880 --> 32:07.449
Yeah, well, that's why we
have lawyers on retainer.

32:07.451 --> 32:11.453
Send Conner, he'll rip
them a new asshole.

32:11.455 --> 32:13.422
Call me back if
anything changes.

32:16.327 --> 32:17.328
Jason Bonds.

32:35.246 --> 32:36.480
Morning, folks.

32:39.183 --> 32:41.250
Morning, Sheriff.

32:41.252 --> 32:42.817
Can I help you?

32:42.819 --> 32:44.386
Got yourself a
permit for this site?

32:44.388 --> 32:45.822
Yes, of course.

32:54.265 --> 32:56.367
Geologic field studies.

32:57.401 --> 32:59.234
Got yourself a county permit?

32:59.236 --> 33:03.338
Just about to head out
and collect some samples.

33:03.340 --> 33:04.606
Well, I hope
you're not planning

33:04.608 --> 33:06.808
on leaving your
site such a mess.

33:06.810 --> 33:09.244
You're just asking
yourself for some bears.

33:09.246 --> 33:10.445
Hear that, people?

33:10.447 --> 33:11.480
Let's make sure the
site is spotless

33:11.482 --> 33:12.714
before we leave it.

33:12.716 --> 33:15.684
We don't want Yogi and
Boo-Boo showing up.

33:15.686 --> 33:16.687
Is that it?

33:18.489 --> 33:19.488
One more thing.

33:19.490 --> 33:20.722
Mmm hmmm.

33:20.724 --> 33:22.457
Gentleman that rented
to site next to yours

33:22.459 --> 33:23.492
was supposed to check out today

33:23.494 --> 33:24.926
and he hasn't shown up.

33:24.928 --> 33:27.462
Hasn't broken down
his site, either.

33:27.464 --> 33:29.700
Anyone seen our neighbor?

33:30.701 --> 33:32.334
No.

33:32.336 --> 33:33.437
'Fraid not.

33:34.538 --> 33:35.837
Well, just probably
got himself lost

33:35.839 --> 33:36.938
and he'll show up
later in the day

33:36.940 --> 33:38.940
on one of the smoke trails.

33:38.942 --> 33:41.576
Welp, ya'll have
yourselves a nice day.

33:41.578 --> 33:42.811
Hey, Sheriff, wait, wait.

33:42.813 --> 33:46.417
Can you tell us about
the Shadow of Death?

33:49.520 --> 33:52.521
Some mountain folks
say there's a creature

33:52.523 --> 33:54.556
that appears every 50 years.

33:58.395 --> 34:02.399
It's a horrid abomination
made of darkness, hate

34:04.935 --> 34:08.472
and kills anything
that gets in its way.

34:12.243 --> 34:14.443
But that's just
mountain folk talking,

34:14.445 --> 34:17.779
and they're all about as
crazy as shithouse rats.

34:17.781 --> 34:20.384
You all have a nice day, now.

34:42.539 --> 34:44.973
You are an abomination of God.

34:44.975 --> 34:46.741
I sentence you to hell.

35:09.933 --> 35:11.900
Told you, it's real, dude.

35:11.902 --> 35:13.468
it's real.

35:13.470 --> 35:14.469
Hey, Dr. Jones.

35:14.471 --> 35:17.539
Dr. Jones, I think I got it.

35:17.541 --> 35:20.041
Everyone, take a look at this.

35:20.043 --> 35:22.444
The U.S.G.S. satellite
places the epicenter

35:22.446 --> 35:24.646
of the tremor right about here.

35:24.648 --> 35:26.415
We've only got two days
to catalog our findings

35:26.417 --> 35:29.318
before we're kicked
out of here by the EPA.

35:29.320 --> 35:30.919
Why not let them do it?

35:30.921 --> 35:33.522
I'm sure they're
better equipped for it.

35:33.524 --> 35:36.825
And at least they're
getting paid.

35:36.827 --> 35:39.361
We're under the gun, people,
and we have a lot of area

35:39.363 --> 35:41.563
to cover, so I'm gonna
break us up in to teams.

35:41.565 --> 35:44.566
Each group will be
assigned a specific task.

35:44.568 --> 35:47.536
Mike, Emma, you two have some
biological training, right?

35:47.538 --> 35:49.070
Yeah.

35:49.072 --> 35:50.439
And you?

35:50.441 --> 35:51.440
Well, actually,
I was Bio major

35:51.442 --> 35:52.741
before I changed to Poli-Sci.

35:52.743 --> 35:54.075
You're with me.

35:54.077 --> 35:57.412
Mike, I want a complete
biological and chemical

35:57.414 --> 36:00.815
breakdown of the epicenter
and it's surrounding regions.

36:00.817 --> 36:04.619
Ance and Shiela, I want
you two to give full

36:04.621 --> 36:06.921
seismic and geological analysis.

36:06.923 --> 36:08.823
You'll head over to the

36:08.825 --> 36:09.991
second largest deposit

36:09.993 --> 36:11.495
on E7 through E14.

36:14.398 --> 36:16.765
Okay, that leaves
George and Amber.

36:16.767 --> 36:20.435
I want a full environmental
impact log and soil samples.

36:20.437 --> 36:23.505
Tank the core, go
as deep as you can.

36:23.507 --> 36:24.575
I'm your man.

36:27.478 --> 36:29.411
Remember, we're
all on channel 2.

36:29.413 --> 36:32.447
Any and all
findings, share them.

36:32.449 --> 36:33.482
What are we waiting for?

36:33.484 --> 36:34.518
Let's go.

36:41.024 --> 36:42.991
'Scuse me for standing.

36:42.993 --> 36:44.659
- Don't get in my way.
- Fine, I won't.

36:44.661 --> 36:46.961
- Then don't.
- Fine, Shiela.

36:46.963 --> 36:48.430
Everybody clear
the way for Shiela.

36:48.432 --> 36:49.431
Whatever.

36:49.433 --> 36:50.465
The path is yours.

36:50.467 --> 36:51.666
Shut up.

36:51.668 --> 36:53.935
Red carpet for Shiela.

37:55.599 --> 37:56.600
Hey babe.

37:59.202 --> 38:01.037
Hey, come on, wake up.

38:04.808 --> 38:05.809
Hey babe.

38:07.544 --> 38:10.180
What, are you gonna
sleep all day?

39:20.216 --> 39:23.486
What is it we're
looking for again?

39:32.963 --> 39:34.497
What about this?

39:45.175 --> 39:46.843
Don't get too close.

39:48.078 --> 39:49.310
Well, it looks like
someone's been using

39:49.312 --> 39:53.014
Bear Claw Mountain as
a toxic waste dump.

39:53.016 --> 39:54.749
I'd say we made a discovery.

39:54.751 --> 39:58.922
We're gonna score some major
brownie points for this.

40:00.824 --> 40:02.826
Let's get some stills.

40:28.919 --> 40:30.885
Hello, there, ha.

40:30.887 --> 40:32.889
Hi, Dr. Chris Jones, uh,

40:34.658 --> 40:37.293
United States
Geological Services.

40:39.062 --> 40:41.696
That's a hell of a
climb you have there.

40:41.698 --> 40:43.364
Anyway, uh,

40:43.366 --> 40:44.833
we're uh,

40:44.835 --> 40:47.168
we're investigating
a series of tremors

40:47.170 --> 40:49.871
that struck the
park last week, uh...

40:49.873 --> 40:53.642
Excuse me, you
wanna turn that off?

40:53.644 --> 40:55.744
This is a very
non-invasive process.

40:55.746 --> 40:56.945
We just need a few samples.

40:56.947 --> 40:58.880
It won't take more than an hour.

40:58.882 --> 41:00.649
We just need your consent.

41:00.651 --> 41:01.652
Goodbye.

41:04.020 --> 41:05.019
What are we
waiting for, people?

41:05.021 --> 41:06.022
Let's go.

41:10.794 --> 41:12.827
ever
since we got here?

41:12.829 --> 41:16.030
Tell me about it,
you know, it's like...

41:16.032 --> 41:17.668
I couldn't leave him
like that.

41:20.403 --> 41:23.371
Call me
back if anything changes.

41:37.353 --> 41:38.820
You are so obnoxious.

41:38.822 --> 41:40.889
Seriously, I'm not, though...

41:40.891 --> 41:42.791
- Yes, you are.
- Way worse than me.

41:42.793 --> 41:44.325
I'm just misunderstood, alright?

41:44.327 --> 41:46.060
Please, I've heard
all of the stories.

41:46.062 --> 41:47.261
And none of 'em are true,

41:47.263 --> 41:50.264
except for the one
about my elephant cock.

41:50.266 --> 41:51.966
You give it rest, please?

41:51.968 --> 41:53.367
What, are you, like,
in the fourth grade?

41:53.369 --> 41:54.969
I thought you
wanted to hook up.

41:54.971 --> 41:56.304
Well, I did, but
that was yesterday,

41:56.306 --> 41:57.305
this is today.

41:57.307 --> 41:58.306
I changed my mind.

41:58.308 --> 41:59.440
Well, what did I do?

41:59.442 --> 42:01.309
Nothing, I'm just,

42:01.311 --> 42:03.745
just not into it
anymore, alright?

42:03.747 --> 42:04.746
I get it.

42:04.748 --> 42:06.715
You're on the rag, right?

42:06.717 --> 42:08.416
That's fine, I don't mind.

42:08.418 --> 42:09.350
Unbelievable.

42:09.352 --> 42:11.753
And you wonder why I
don't wanna hook up.

42:11.755 --> 42:12.756
Come on.

42:13.924 --> 42:16.224
Don't leave me hangin' here.

42:16.226 --> 42:17.491
I got needs.

42:17.493 --> 42:18.492
You got needs.

42:18.494 --> 42:21.329
What you need to do
is start taking samples.

42:21.331 --> 42:22.330
Get away from me.

42:22.332 --> 42:24.398
Yeah, you'll come around.

42:24.400 --> 42:25.433
They always do.

42:25.435 --> 42:26.436
Okay.

42:27.303 --> 42:29.672
Well, where are you going?

42:30.473 --> 42:32.108
To take a piss.

42:32.976 --> 42:34.275
Why don't you come along?

42:34.277 --> 42:36.277
See what all the fuss is.

42:45.055 --> 42:46.456
Ugh, focus Amber.

42:48.391 --> 42:49.392
Three credits.

42:50.526 --> 42:52.794
You can do this

42:52.796 --> 42:53.797
one thing.

42:57.333 --> 42:58.334
Okay.

43:06.109 --> 43:07.541
God.
Ah!

43:07.543 --> 43:09.077
George?

43:09.079 --> 43:10.080
Ugh.

43:11.347 --> 43:13.114
George, oh God, oh no.

43:14.117 --> 43:15.383
You better be here for love.

43:15.385 --> 43:16.450
Get your pants
up and let's go.

43:16.452 --> 43:19.453
- Turn around.
- Come on.

43:19.455 --> 43:20.789
I thought you were
taking a piss.

43:20.791 --> 43:21.856
Change in plan.

43:21.858 --> 43:22.857
Hurry up.

43:22.859 --> 43:24.325
Come on.

43:24.327 --> 43:25.862
Oh, goddammit.

43:27.130 --> 43:28.830
Get your pants
on, George, let's go.

43:28.832 --> 43:29.933
Oh, please.

43:31.835 --> 43:33.001
Hurry up, come on, George.

43:34.170 --> 43:35.169
Where is the fire?

43:35.171 --> 43:36.339
Right there.

43:37.941 --> 43:39.040
Who the fuck is that?

43:39.042 --> 43:40.208
Well, how the
hell am I supposed to know?

43:40.210 --> 43:44.145
- Give me the radio.
- Why?

43:44.147 --> 43:45.379
Dr. Jones?

43:45.381 --> 43:46.881
Dr. Jones, come in.

43:46.883 --> 43:48.316
- Dr. Jones!
- Gimme that!

43:50.386 --> 43:52.987
- Well, wait up!
- Speed up!

43:52.989 --> 43:54.457
Slow down, George.

44:15.411 --> 44:16.410
Wait here, people.

44:16.412 --> 44:18.081
I have to take this.

44:19.449 --> 44:22.452
Seriously, what
is that all about?

44:36.366 --> 44:38.501
Mike, Emma, get over here.

44:41.004 --> 44:43.637
Whoa, that is the
biggest one yet.

44:43.639 --> 44:45.073
Careful, guys.

44:45.075 --> 44:46.307
Don't contaminate
the flow pattern

44:46.309 --> 44:49.243
until Mike has a
chance to document it.

44:49.245 --> 44:50.244
Get it from the
other angle, too.

44:50.246 --> 44:52.148
I want close-up stills.

44:57.053 --> 44:58.521
This is fascinating.

44:59.422 --> 45:00.423
Alright.

45:03.894 --> 45:05.595
What have we got here?

45:09.299 --> 45:12.166
Not a molecule of
oxygen or drop of water

45:12.168 --> 45:13.167
left in its body.

45:13.169 --> 45:17.338
Every ounce of fluid has
been drained from it.

45:17.340 --> 45:18.372
That's what killed it.

45:18.374 --> 45:21.609
Cellular collapse
and dehydration.

45:21.611 --> 45:23.377
Well, I've never seen
a geo-chemical reaction

45:23.379 --> 45:24.580
like this before.

45:26.449 --> 45:29.050
Alright, we're gonna have to
run a complete diagnostic.

45:29.052 --> 45:30.451
That's gonna take three hours.

45:30.453 --> 45:31.452
You better get started.

45:33.123 --> 45:34.124
Dr. Jones.

45:36.359 --> 45:39.395
Stupid work here.
Such an idiot.

46:01.417 --> 46:02.418
Jim?

46:06.589 --> 46:07.590
Jimmy?

46:28.278 --> 46:29.510
Dr. Jones?

46:31.214 --> 46:32.215
Dr. Jones?

46:32.715 --> 46:33.916
Anybody!

46:35.618 --> 46:39.055
Oh, fuck.

47:05.115 --> 47:06.214
Emma.

47:06.216 --> 47:07.683
Take a look at this.

47:11.354 --> 47:12.453
Is this from that same pool?

47:12.455 --> 47:13.487
Mmm hmm.

47:13.489 --> 47:16.090
That looks like a
primitive cell structure.

47:16.092 --> 47:18.226
Whoa, whoa, are you
saying that gunk is alive?

47:18.228 --> 47:20.328
Least it was, once.

47:20.330 --> 47:22.496
Must take an extraordinary
amount of energy

47:22.498 --> 47:23.464
to animate it.

47:23.466 --> 47:25.466
This small sample simply
doesn't have enough

47:25.468 --> 47:26.467
to sustain it.

47:26.469 --> 47:30.273
It must be a fragment
of a much larger entity.

47:33.143 --> 47:34.775
Let's call it a day and
head back to base camp.

47:34.777 --> 47:37.745
Let everyone else know that
we're calling it a day.

47:37.747 --> 47:40.081
All groups report
back to base camp.

47:40.083 --> 47:43.451
I repeat, all groups
report back to base camp.

48:28.498 --> 48:30.231
It's gonna be okay, honey.

49:38.501 --> 49:40.801
Jim,
honey, where'd you go?

49:40.803 --> 49:43.171
Don't, I'm just
going to the bathroom.

49:43.173 --> 49:44.872
Well, hurry
up, I'm getting cold.

49:44.874 --> 49:48.544
Yeah, just uh, just
go back to sleep, now.

50:59.449 --> 51:01.349
Regina, you out there?

51:01.351 --> 51:03.517
Morning,
Rob, what can I do you for, hon?

51:03.519 --> 51:06.387
Tell Randy to come up
here with the truck, asap.

51:06.389 --> 51:07.721
Right away, Sheriff.

51:07.723 --> 51:09.790
And tell him to bring his kit.

51:09.792 --> 51:11.892
Looks like we got us
a double homicide.

51:11.894 --> 51:13.361
We
must have a bad connection.

51:13.363 --> 51:14.395
It sounded like
you said double...

51:14.397 --> 51:15.431
I did.

51:16.866 --> 51:18.966
And Regina, one more
thing, there's a group

51:18.968 --> 51:20.634
of college students out here.

51:20.636 --> 51:22.470
Call the college
Geology department

51:22.472 --> 51:25.573
and get me the cell phone
number of a Dr. Jones,

51:25.575 --> 51:26.874
you got that?

51:26.876 --> 51:27.875
Yes,
I'll see what I can do.

51:27.877 --> 51:29.443
Thanks Regina.

51:29.445 --> 51:31.712
I'll keep my ears on.

51:58.708 --> 51:59.840
No!

52:00.843 --> 52:01.844
No!

52:08.551 --> 52:11.287
It was just a
bad dream, honey.

52:12.021 --> 52:13.454
No, it just happened.

52:13.456 --> 52:14.922
I saw you dead.

52:14.924 --> 52:16.557
I killed you.

52:35.578 --> 52:36.579
Ah!

52:37.513 --> 52:39.413
Why did you do that?

52:39.415 --> 52:41.749
It's just a sedative.

52:41.751 --> 52:43.817
It'll help you calm down.

52:43.819 --> 52:45.453
I can't.

52:45.455 --> 52:47.523
Come on, now, lie back.

53:13.015 --> 53:15.416
Anyone have a smoke?

53:15.418 --> 53:16.417
You gotta quit that.

53:16.419 --> 53:18.421
It's bad for your health.

53:27.663 --> 53:31.532
One of our team's found
toxic waste in quadrant 17.

53:31.534 --> 53:33.603
Maybe it's some sort of
Indian burial ground.

53:34.904 --> 53:38.506
No, no, they don't
know anything yet.

53:38.508 --> 53:39.873
Yeah.

53:39.875 --> 53:41.575
That's exactly what
I was thinking.

53:42.945 --> 53:44.013
Hello? Hello?

53:45.047 --> 53:46.048
Shit.

53:50.786 --> 53:52.653
Did you have any luck
getting through to the police?

53:52.655 --> 53:56.189
Yeah, Sheriff couldn't
make it out today.

53:56.191 --> 53:57.190
Gather 'round everyone.

53:57.192 --> 53:59.128
I have an announcement.

54:03.499 --> 54:05.132
Where's George and Amber?

54:05.134 --> 54:07.935
Oh, they didn't make
it back last night, sir.

54:07.937 --> 54:09.803
- Really.
- I checked their tents.

54:09.805 --> 54:11.572
Same as it was yesterday.

54:11.574 --> 54:13.874
Alright,
I'll check on that, then.

54:13.876 --> 54:15.476
Anyway, I spoke with the college

54:15.478 --> 54:17.878
and they want us to
continue our research.

54:17.880 --> 54:19.212
We might be able to help them

54:19.214 --> 54:20.714
build a case
against the assholes

54:20.716 --> 54:23.684
dumping the toxic
waste in this area.

54:23.686 --> 54:24.687
Mike, Emma.

54:26.822 --> 54:28.489
You two are on your own.

54:28.491 --> 54:30.190
I'm gonna hike over
to the epicenter.

54:30.192 --> 54:34.528
Maybe the owner's in a, is a
little more rational today.

54:34.530 --> 54:36.532
Emma, you are in charge.

54:39.234 --> 54:41.201
Why does anybody
have to be in charge?

54:43.072 --> 54:44.137
What's so funny?

55:13.068 --> 55:14.637
Damn you, George.

55:16.939 --> 55:17.940
This sucks.

55:25.247 --> 55:28.516
I know it doesn't
make any sense.

55:28.518 --> 55:31.018
I really want to get him
in for a full physical.

55:31.020 --> 55:32.152
A CAT scan maybe?

55:32.154 --> 55:33.455
I don't know.

55:34.557 --> 55:36.023
Oh, um, I gotta go.

55:36.025 --> 55:38.291
I'll talk to ya later, bye.

55:38.293 --> 55:39.560
Oh, Jim.

55:39.562 --> 55:43.163
Honey, are you, I don't think
you should be out of bed yet.

55:43.165 --> 55:44.231
Who was that?

55:44.233 --> 55:45.735
Honey, sit down.

55:47.703 --> 55:49.236
I told her about
your remission.

55:49.238 --> 55:52.072
She scheduled you for
a full exam next week.

55:52.074 --> 55:54.608
She can schedule me all the
appointments she wants to.

55:54.610 --> 55:56.512
I'm not going anywhere.

55:57.913 --> 56:00.213
Honey, I don't think you
know how sick you really are.

56:00.215 --> 56:02.518
I've never been better.

56:03.719 --> 56:07.757
You don't remember anything
that happened last night?

56:09.291 --> 56:11.761
I think you should leave.

56:16.165 --> 56:18.131
It's okay,
it's just a sedative.

56:18.133 --> 56:19.735
You sit down, then.

56:22.738 --> 56:26.974
I just don't know
who I am anymore, Tam.

56:26.976 --> 56:28.043
I don't know.

56:42.892 --> 56:44.627
Bear Claw Mountain.

56:46.061 --> 56:49.763
Yeah, I need the number
for the nearest hospital.

56:49.765 --> 56:50.833
Okay, thanks.

57:13.789 --> 57:16.291
This is way too fascinating.

57:19.194 --> 57:23.731
Searching the area for
any possible booby traps.

57:23.733 --> 57:24.932
Emma?

57:24.934 --> 57:27.102
Emma, I found another one.

57:33.242 --> 57:34.675
Do you know how big a
tremor it would have to be

57:34.677 --> 57:36.910
to unearth a barrel that size?

57:36.912 --> 57:39.079
Can you shoot it
from this angle?

57:39.081 --> 57:40.850
What's that?

57:43.318 --> 57:44.317
This is really nasty.

57:44.319 --> 57:46.186
I need a closer look.

57:55.898 --> 57:57.164
Well, that's interesting.

57:57.166 --> 57:58.165
What?

57:58.167 --> 57:59.399
Let me see.

57:59.401 --> 58:01.401
This stuff actually has a
primitive cell structure, too.

58:01.403 --> 58:03.070
Just like that other spooge.

58:03.072 --> 58:04.073
Yeah.

58:05.708 --> 58:08.343
Okay, so, that spilled this way,

58:09.812 --> 58:11.146
mixed with that.

58:12.715 --> 58:13.714
Let me try something.

58:13.716 --> 58:15.048
What is it of?

58:15.050 --> 58:16.051
Hang on.

58:23.859 --> 58:25.759
Did you, did you hear that?

58:25.761 --> 58:26.762
Oh.

59:28.357 --> 59:29.959
Son of a bitch.

01:00:35.524 --> 01:00:37.159
Come on, come on.

01:01:06.321 --> 01:01:07.322
Regina.

01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:13.328
I found our missing hiker.

01:01:14.496 --> 01:01:16.429
Have you heard back
from the college yet?

01:01:16.431 --> 01:01:19.134
Not yet.

01:01:20.035 --> 01:01:21.034
Call Jerry.

01:01:21.036 --> 01:01:23.203
Tell him to shut down the park.

01:01:23.205 --> 01:01:26.408
We have a maniac loose
in here somewhere.

01:01:44.059 --> 01:01:46.328
Oh, thank God, thank God.

01:02:21.396 --> 01:02:24.097
Who's in charge, here?

01:02:41.616 --> 01:02:42.950
Anything?

01:02:42.952 --> 01:02:45.485
Oh, uh, no, nothing yet.

01:02:45.487 --> 01:02:48.255
This is an amazing
waste of time.

01:02:48.257 --> 01:02:49.722
Well, Shiela,
complaining's not

01:02:49.724 --> 01:02:52.225
gonna make it go any faster.

01:02:52.227 --> 01:02:54.094
I've been thinking
about this stuff.

01:02:54.096 --> 01:02:56.063
Maybe it's not what
we think it is.

01:02:56.065 --> 01:02:57.264
Okay, I'm listening.

01:02:57.266 --> 01:03:01.568
Dr. Jones said it had a
primitive cell structure, right?

01:03:01.570 --> 01:03:05.505
What if it was a natural
defense to the chemical waste?

01:03:05.507 --> 01:03:06.508
Oh.

01:03:07.509 --> 01:03:09.242
That's a really
interesting theory.

01:03:10.345 --> 01:03:11.411
Hold on.

01:03:11.413 --> 01:03:13.080
Hey, we have seismic activity.

01:03:13.082 --> 01:03:14.083
Finally.

01:03:15.117 --> 01:03:18.320
That's strange,
it's, it's almost rhythmic.

01:03:20.189 --> 01:03:21.188
Is it another earthquake?

01:03:21.190 --> 01:03:23.325
No, not at all, it's um...

01:03:28.063 --> 01:03:29.062
Oh my God!

01:03:31.066 --> 01:03:32.401
Oh my God!

01:03:43.512 --> 01:03:45.280
Get away from it.

01:03:46.481 --> 01:03:48.017
Are you alright?

01:03:49.151 --> 01:03:50.717
Where's the rest of your group?

01:03:50.719 --> 01:03:52.321
Where's your group?

01:03:54.423 --> 01:03:56.489
Hello, hello, is anyone there?

01:03:56.491 --> 01:03:57.490
Yeah.

01:03:57.492 --> 01:03:58.658
This is Sheriff Reynolds.

01:03:58.660 --> 01:04:00.127
I need you to
assemble your entire

01:04:00.129 --> 01:04:01.694
group and get back
to the trail head.

01:04:01.696 --> 01:04:03.396
- Something happen?
- Just do it!

01:04:03.398 --> 01:04:04.497
This is an emergency.

01:04:04.499 --> 01:04:05.498
Now!

01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:07.236
Back to the trail head.

01:04:12.441 --> 01:04:14.041
Get out of here, now.

01:04:14.043 --> 01:04:15.377
Get out of here!

01:04:28.590 --> 01:04:31.593
Fu...

01:04:38.733 --> 01:04:41.134
I can't promise
complete accuracy.

01:04:41.136 --> 01:04:42.269
We don't have the
latest equipment

01:04:42.271 --> 01:04:43.570
out here in the sticks.

01:04:43.572 --> 01:04:45.438
That's fine.

01:04:45.440 --> 01:04:46.441
Let's see.

01:04:49.111 --> 01:04:51.513
First pass seems pretty normal.

01:04:52.547 --> 01:04:55.115
Red cell count is a bit high.

01:04:55.117 --> 01:04:57.817
Elevated blood sugar but,

01:04:57.819 --> 01:05:00.355
nothing out of the ordinary.

01:05:01.523 --> 01:05:02.524
Hold on.

01:05:03.625 --> 01:05:06.393
Let's go in for closer look.

01:05:08.497 --> 01:05:12.467
Looks like the cells have
changed on a genetic level.

01:05:14.469 --> 01:05:15.770
Wait, your sample.

01:05:25.314 --> 01:05:26.446
No, we're on our way
back to the trail...

01:05:42.264 --> 01:05:44.497
Holy fuck, what the
fuck happened to my car?

01:05:44.499 --> 01:05:46.533
You guys, you guys.

01:05:46.535 --> 01:05:48.301
Don't ever scare
me like that again.

01:05:48.303 --> 01:05:49.736
Ever!

01:05:49.738 --> 01:05:52.239
Emma, it killed the
Sheriff and it killed Shiela

01:05:52.241 --> 01:05:53.506
and it's gonna kill us!

01:05:53.508 --> 01:05:54.741
Ance, calm down,
what is going on?

01:05:54.743 --> 01:05:56.276
How do we get out of here?

01:05:56.278 --> 01:05:57.210
How do we get out of here?

01:05:57.212 --> 01:05:59.479
I think there's a
freeway right over...

01:05:59.481 --> 01:06:00.647
Ance!!

01:06:00.649 --> 01:06:01.748
What is going on?

01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:03.483
Mike, come on!

01:06:13.395 --> 01:06:14.394
What is going on?

01:06:14.396 --> 01:06:15.662
I don't know, okay?

01:06:15.664 --> 01:06:16.896
Something attacked
us and the Sheriff

01:06:16.898 --> 01:06:18.231
thought he killed it but
it wasn't dead, okay?

01:06:18.233 --> 01:06:19.399
Okay, what is it?

01:06:19.401 --> 01:06:20.867
- What?
- I don't know!

01:06:20.869 --> 01:06:22.237
Just hurry up!

01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:27.440
Shut up, you got us lost!

01:06:27.442 --> 01:06:28.541
Why, I didn't get you lost!

01:06:28.543 --> 01:06:29.676
The freeway is right over there

01:06:29.678 --> 01:06:31.378
and I'm not going anywhere until

01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:32.679
you tell me what's going on.

01:06:32.681 --> 01:06:33.513
It killed her!

01:06:33.515 --> 01:06:35.682
What is it?
You keep saying it.

01:06:35.684 --> 01:06:37.350
It's a monster.
It's the monster.

01:06:37.352 --> 01:06:38.351
I don't know what it is!

01:06:38.353 --> 01:06:39.752
What do you mean it's the...

01:06:52.934 --> 01:06:53.933
I know what I saw,
I know what I saw,

01:06:53.935 --> 01:06:55.535
but it wasn't a monster, no way.

01:06:55.537 --> 01:06:56.836
Victims were killed
by a man-beast

01:06:56.838 --> 01:06:58.371
that was eight feel tall
and black as night, Ance.

01:06:58.373 --> 01:07:00.240
Think about it, this
is the Shadow of Death.

01:07:00.242 --> 01:07:02.442
No, Ance is right,
it can't be a monster.

01:07:02.444 --> 01:07:03.676
No, you remember
what the Sheriff said?

01:07:03.678 --> 01:07:06.413
You guys, I'm serious,
this is for real.

01:07:06.415 --> 01:07:07.714
It's real.

01:07:07.716 --> 01:07:08.981
There's not even
anything back there.

01:07:08.983 --> 01:07:10.550
I didn't see anything
the whole time we ran!

01:07:10.552 --> 01:07:12.352
You saying I'm lying?

01:07:12.354 --> 01:07:14.423
Did you guys hear that?

01:07:32.374 --> 01:07:33.375
Mike, oh!

01:07:57.566 --> 01:07:59.432
Oh my god!
I tried not to hit him.

01:07:59.434 --> 01:08:00.900
No, no, do not
touch him, please.

01:08:00.902 --> 01:08:03.436
Alright, let me get his head.

01:08:03.438 --> 01:08:06.539
Help me, I need
your help please.

01:08:06.541 --> 01:08:07.440
We have to wait
for an ambulance.

01:08:07.442 --> 01:08:09.476
No, we can't wait
for an ambulance.

01:08:09.478 --> 01:08:11.911
That thing is gonna wake up.

01:08:11.913 --> 01:08:13.815
Come on, Ance, I need...

01:08:15.049 --> 01:08:16.549
Stand up.

01:08:16.551 --> 01:08:19.719
I know it hurts,
please stand up.

01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:20.721
Come on.

01:08:41.576 --> 01:08:43.510
Do you have a cell
phone I can use?

01:08:43.511 --> 01:08:45.444
Thank you, thank you so much.

01:08:45.447 --> 01:08:47.380
Hang on, Ance, hang on.

01:08:47.381 --> 01:08:48.415
Hello?

01:08:48.417 --> 01:08:49.515
Hi, hi, um, listen.

01:08:49.518 --> 01:08:51.684
I am with a group of friends
up at Bear Claw Mountain

01:08:51.685 --> 01:08:53.553
and some of my friends
have just been killed.

01:08:53.555 --> 01:08:54.587
One of them is
injured and I need you

01:08:54.589 --> 01:08:56.889
to send somebody right now.

01:08:56.890 --> 01:09:00.460
No, it killed the Sheriff,
too, so I need you to send...

01:09:00.462 --> 01:09:02.462
I don't know, just anybody
with a gun, please,

01:09:02.464 --> 01:09:04.095
just send somebody now.

01:09:04.098 --> 01:09:06.698
We are headed west
on Bear Claw Road.

01:09:06.701 --> 01:09:09.469
No, no, no, the town's
the other direction.

01:09:09.470 --> 01:09:10.303
Ah!

01:09:10.305 --> 01:09:11.470
He's right,
he's right, we need

01:09:11.473 --> 01:09:12.572
to turn this car around.

01:09:12.573 --> 01:09:14.774
I have to go to my cabin first.

01:09:14.776 --> 01:09:16.475
No, no,
we don't have time.

01:09:16.478 --> 01:09:17.510
We have to get out of here.

01:09:17.511 --> 01:09:18.845
My boyfriend is
still up there.

01:09:18.846 --> 01:09:20.447
I won't leave him.

01:09:20.448 --> 01:09:21.348
Please listen to me.

01:09:21.350 --> 01:09:22.915
The police are on
their way right now

01:09:22.917 --> 01:09:25.484
and they can help him much,
much more than we can.

01:09:25.487 --> 01:09:28.020
I have to get my
friend to a hospital.

01:09:37.532 --> 01:09:38.533
Wait here.

01:09:45.840 --> 01:09:47.038
Put this on.

01:09:47.041 --> 01:09:48.040
She's gonna come back,
she'll come back.

01:09:48.042 --> 01:09:49.042
Just put it on.

01:09:50.879 --> 01:09:52.444
Jim?

01:09:52.447 --> 01:09:53.448
Jim?

01:09:59.521 --> 01:10:01.388
Oh my God.

01:10:01.390 --> 01:10:03.122
Can you hear me?

01:10:03.124 --> 01:10:05.124
Oh, Jim, we have to
get you out of here.

01:10:05.126 --> 01:10:06.826
Can you stand up for me?

01:10:06.828 --> 01:10:08.461
Can you do that?

01:10:08.463 --> 01:10:11.864
Come on, honey, I need you
to stand up for me, okay?

01:10:11.866 --> 01:10:13.600
- Can you do that for me?
- Leave me alone.

01:10:13.602 --> 01:10:15.101
Jim, listen to me.

01:10:15.103 --> 01:10:16.838
You're not safe here.

01:10:18.973 --> 01:10:22.442
There's nothing left
for you here anymore.

01:10:22.444 --> 01:10:24.446
Go, before you get hurt.

01:10:27.849 --> 01:10:30.752
Goddammit, where
the fuck is she?

01:10:32.554 --> 01:10:34.421
Hang on Ance.

01:10:34.423 --> 01:10:35.422
I can't breathe.

01:10:35.424 --> 01:10:37.890
You can't breathe at all?

01:10:37.892 --> 01:10:40.460
Fuck I cannot wait for her...

01:10:40.462 --> 01:10:41.494
Just hang on.

01:10:41.496 --> 01:10:44.499
- Emma!
- Hang on Ance.

01:10:45.967 --> 01:10:46.968
Lady?

01:10:49.471 --> 01:10:50.472
Hey, lady?

01:10:54.008 --> 01:10:55.844
I killed those kids.

01:10:57.211 --> 01:10:59.479
I couldn't stop myself.

01:10:59.481 --> 01:11:01.448
The blackness.

01:11:01.450 --> 01:11:03.117
It's in control now.

01:11:05.554 --> 01:11:07.219
Trust me, I know.

01:11:08.790 --> 01:11:09.791
Hey, lady?

01:11:11.926 --> 01:11:12.927
Help me!

01:11:18.467 --> 01:11:21.970
You're gonna die
just like your friends.

01:11:23.237 --> 01:11:25.672
What did you say
about my friends?

01:11:29.010 --> 01:11:30.843
How did you know
that my friends died?

01:11:30.845 --> 01:11:32.512
Do it!
Do me now!

01:11:32.514 --> 01:11:33.546
Do it!

01:11:33.548 --> 01:11:34.547
Do me now!

01:11:38.787 --> 01:11:40.052
Come on, open the door.

01:11:40.054 --> 01:11:41.053
I'm not touching that door!

01:11:41.055 --> 01:11:42.056
Do me now!

01:11:48.196 --> 01:11:51.500
Then we're just
gonna shoot through it.

01:11:56.805 --> 01:12:00.509
We have an emergency at
107 Bear Claw Mountain Road.

01:12:13.287 --> 01:12:14.088
Shit.

01:12:15.289 --> 01:12:17.524
- What does that mean?
- Shhh, shut up.

01:12:26.835 --> 01:12:28.300
Hey, hey, come here!

01:12:29.538 --> 01:12:30.572
Come here.

01:12:31.305 --> 01:12:32.605
Come here.

01:12:37.011 --> 01:12:38.012
My God no!

01:12:39.714 --> 01:12:41.113
Emma, come on, Emma!

01:12:41.115 --> 01:12:42.114
He's doing this for you!

01:12:42.116 --> 01:12:43.585
Let go of me!

01:12:44.285 --> 01:12:45.520
Fuck!

01:12:47.188 --> 01:12:48.555
No!

01:13:01.836 --> 01:13:03.069
Just go.

01:13:03.071 --> 01:13:04.072
Go.

01:13:04.839 --> 01:13:06.005
We have to go.

01:13:06.007 --> 01:13:07.640
Run.
Ance, go.

01:13:28.296 --> 01:13:30.164
Go, Ance, just go.

01:13:43.344 --> 01:13:44.579
Oh!

01:14:23.384 --> 01:14:24.917
Go, Ance, just go.

01:14:51.746 --> 01:14:53.312
Get up, get up.

01:14:54.816 --> 01:14:55.984
Come on, Ance.

01:14:59.754 --> 01:15:00.920
No, no, no, I've
been here before.

01:15:00.922 --> 01:15:02.757
I've been here before.

01:15:15.469 --> 01:15:16.468
What's that?

01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:17.704
What is that?

01:15:17.706 --> 01:15:19.273
It's toxic waste.

01:15:46.100 --> 01:15:47.268
Fuckin' die!

01:16:20.769 --> 01:16:23.402
After the massacre,
all of those barrels

01:16:23.404 --> 01:16:25.840
just magically disappeared,

01:16:27.275 --> 01:16:30.409
so no one could ever find
out what was in any of them.

01:16:30.411 --> 01:16:32.344
But that little shit mayor,

01:16:32.346 --> 01:16:34.313
he certainly got rich.

01:16:34.315 --> 01:16:37.183
All the more reason for him
to go after you, I suppose...

01:16:42.156 --> 01:16:46.458
You go find the official
autopsy on Jim Sheridan.

01:16:46.460 --> 01:16:50.431
His body was held together
with nothin' but cancer.

01:16:52.200 --> 01:16:55.234
I guess old Jim couldn't
escape his fate.

01:16:55.236 --> 01:16:58.337
I don't think
anyone can, Sheriff.

01:16:58.339 --> 01:17:01.073
Now, what about this creature?

01:17:01.075 --> 01:17:03.275
I thought about
that for years.

01:17:03.277 --> 01:17:04.278
That thing,

01:17:06.414 --> 01:17:08.414
it was a disease.

01:17:08.416 --> 01:17:10.282
What do you mean by that?

01:17:10.284 --> 01:17:12.919
It grew so fast
out of sick land,

01:17:12.921 --> 01:17:15.387
it only attacked the healthy

01:17:15.389 --> 01:17:18.825
and then it just disappeared?

01:17:18.827 --> 01:17:21.360
A disease can't just die.

01:17:21.362 --> 01:17:24.363
So, what really
happened to it?

01:17:24.365 --> 01:17:26.098
It went dormant.

01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:29.902
It mutated into something
else, I don't know.

01:17:33.341 --> 01:17:35.842
What I do know,
is all of your fans

01:17:35.844 --> 01:17:38.945
have got to stay away
from Bear Claw Mountain.

01:17:38.947 --> 01:17:43.117
Something that evil can never
be completely destroyed.

01:17:44.252 --> 01:17:47.920
I like to say that
those things exist now,

01:17:47.922 --> 01:17:50.191
in the Shadowlands, wooh.

01:17:52.460 --> 01:17:54.060
So, what about the
other survivors?

01:17:54.062 --> 01:17:55.895
Have you heard from any of them?

01:17:55.897 --> 01:18:00.032
Uh, that was ten years
ago, miss, I don't know.

01:18:00.034 --> 01:18:01.333
Well, would it
surprise you to know

01:18:01.335 --> 01:18:03.371
that they're all dead?

01:18:05.473 --> 01:18:06.873
What?

01:18:06.875 --> 01:18:08.307
Ance got his throat
slashed last week

01:18:08.309 --> 01:18:10.342
during an apparent robbery.

01:18:10.344 --> 01:18:13.212
That's city life for ya.

01:18:13.214 --> 01:18:15.481
You know, it seems
to me that you're

01:18:15.483 --> 01:18:17.316
the last witness
to tell the tale

01:18:17.318 --> 01:18:19.952
of the Bear Claw
Massacre, Sheriff.

01:18:19.954 --> 01:18:22.354
No, no, that's not right.

01:18:22.356 --> 01:18:25.057
The two girls they
found in the woods.

01:18:25.059 --> 01:18:26.058
They're still alive.

01:18:26.060 --> 01:18:28.895
No, Tamara Lee died in um,

01:18:28.897 --> 01:18:30.362
what did you call it?

01:18:30.364 --> 01:18:33.332
A booby hatch, five years ago.

01:18:33.334 --> 01:18:34.502
It was cancer.

01:18:37.138 --> 01:18:38.306
Kat Sampson.

01:18:40.008 --> 01:18:41.573
Um, they brought her into
the hospital after me.

01:18:41.575 --> 01:18:43.609
They said she
survived the attack.

01:18:43.611 --> 01:18:46.645
Oh, it wasn't an
attack, Sheriff.

01:18:46.647 --> 01:18:48.016
It was a rape.

01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:50.516
She was raped?

01:18:50.518 --> 01:18:51.517
In the woods?

01:18:51.519 --> 01:18:53.419
And she was so strong.

01:18:53.421 --> 01:18:56.355
She held on for
four whole months

01:18:56.357 --> 01:18:59.125
until she delivered
a healthy baby.

01:18:59.127 --> 01:19:01.961
And the doctors called
it a miracle birth

01:19:01.963 --> 01:19:04.463
and that baby grew so fast.

01:19:04.465 --> 01:19:06.999
Twice as fast as any
normal child would.

01:19:07.001 --> 01:19:09.468
It was like it had
a growing disease.

01:19:09.470 --> 01:19:11.170
That's impossible.

01:19:11.172 --> 01:19:16.042
It was a gift, a gift from
the daddy that she never knew.

01:19:16.044 --> 01:19:19.311
And he gave her so
many gifts, as well as

01:19:19.313 --> 01:19:22.114
a family debt that
needed to be repaid.

01:19:22.116 --> 01:19:24.318
That's why I'm here, Sheriff.

01:19:25.386 --> 01:19:26.420
For you.

01:19:29.590 --> 01:19:32.358
This one's for you, Daddy.

01:19:34.495 --> 01:19:36.495
My beautiful gift.

01:19:39.533 --> 01:19:40.534
No, no!

01:19:48.176 --> 01:19:49.177
No!

01:20:05.168 --> 01:20:10.262
