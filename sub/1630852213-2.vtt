00:15.679 --> 00:16.719
Hello.

00:18.160 --> 00:19.280
Welcome.

00:21.960 --> 00:23.039
Hello.

00:23.120 --> 00:24.320
After giving birth,

00:24.399 --> 00:27.600
a lot of women experience
the baby blues,

00:27.679 --> 00:29.399
which lasts about two weeks.

00:29.480 --> 00:33.079
However, there are a lot more women
than we imagine

00:33.159 --> 00:35.960
who are unaware
that they have severe anxiety.

00:36.039 --> 00:40.399
If it isn't treated,
it can turn into postpartum depression.

00:41.000 --> 00:42.200
For instance,

00:42.280 --> 00:45.520
you told me you thought
you'd be over the moon

00:45.600 --> 00:48.840
when he was born,
and yet you feel sad.

00:49.399 --> 00:50.399
Why is that?

00:50.920 --> 00:53.759
A possible mixture
of hormonal changes,

00:53.840 --> 00:57.359
tiredness, accepting the new situation...

00:57.439 --> 00:59.640
It's normal to feel that way.

00:59.719 --> 01:02.719
A lot of women are facing a reality

01:02.799 --> 01:05.200
that doesn't match what they expected.

01:05.280 --> 01:06.599
And they reject it.

01:06.920 --> 01:07.879
Excuse me...

01:07.959 --> 01:11.040
-Are you suggesting I reject my son?
-No, I'm not.

01:11.120 --> 01:13.560
Even if it were the case, it's fine.

01:13.640 --> 01:15.480
Let's go back to why you're here.

01:19.959 --> 01:21.920
I'm going to go. Yes.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.159
-Sure?
-Yes, I'm sorry.

01:24.239 --> 01:25.840
It's not you, it's me.

01:26.359 --> 01:27.439
That's all.

01:27.920 --> 01:28.879
Mar?...

01:29.560 --> 01:31.000
Come back whenever you want.

01:33.239 --> 01:34.799
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

01:39.760 --> 01:41.120
MARIA AGUADO, 35...

01:44.560 --> 01:47.680
PERFECT LIFE

01:47.760 --> 01:49.799
WHEN YOU TRY TO START OVER

01:49.879 --> 01:51.120
Hello.

01:53.319 --> 01:54.159
4 WEEKS LATER

01:54.239 --> 01:55.840
Excuse me,
I'm losing my voice.

01:55.920 --> 01:57.799
-Oh dear.
-Don't worry.

01:57.879 --> 01:59.719
Thyme, works a treat.

01:59.799 --> 02:01.840
I can come back another day.

02:02.599 --> 02:03.959
It's okay.

02:04.040 --> 02:05.599
Sorry for leaving that way.

02:06.040 --> 02:08.759
It's fine, I'm glad you're back.

02:09.240 --> 02:11.879
-He's so well-behaved.
-I didn't know if I could bring him.

02:11.960 --> 02:14.199
I've had women breastfeeding here.

02:14.280 --> 02:16.120
I can't, I had mastitis.

02:16.199 --> 02:19.280
Better for you.
You can leave him with someone.

02:21.439 --> 02:23.560
If they're available, but...

02:25.080 --> 02:27.599
My sister was going to help me,

02:27.680 --> 02:28.960
now she ignores me.

02:29.039 --> 02:30.840
"She ignores me"?

02:31.199 --> 02:32.520
What happened?

02:33.120 --> 02:33.960
She got a girlfriend.

02:34.960 --> 02:36.719
-Okay...
-They moved in together

02:36.800 --> 02:37.840
and are marrying.

02:37.919 --> 02:40.840
Want to marry someone you just met?
Fine.

02:40.919 --> 02:43.080
But don't make promises, then disappear.

02:43.159 --> 02:44.960
How did it make you feel?

02:45.479 --> 02:48.000
-It's not right.
-Don't judge it.

02:48.080 --> 02:51.120
I asked you to tell me
what it makes you feel.

02:55.479 --> 02:56.319
Rage.

02:56.879 --> 02:58.000
What else?

02:58.719 --> 02:59.439
Frustration.

02:59.520 --> 03:00.240
Disappointment.

03:00.319 --> 03:00.840
Anger.

03:00.919 --> 03:01.960
More, more...

03:04.439 --> 03:05.479
Envy.

03:07.639 --> 03:08.360
Why?

03:10.560 --> 03:13.599
Because she can begin a new life plan.

03:18.199 --> 03:21.319
It completely gets rid of dark circles.

03:21.840 --> 03:24.000
You see what I see, right?

03:24.919 --> 03:27.840
No, no.
I'm at a stage in my life

03:27.919 --> 03:32.319
where I'd rather leave my comfort zones.
Shake it up a bit, be daring.

03:32.400 --> 03:34.599
-Go a bit crazy...
-Yes.

03:34.680 --> 03:38.120
How about we take the plunge
and go for NC20?

03:38.199 --> 03:41.120
NC20, let me see.
That's quite a big deal.

03:41.199 --> 03:42.560
-Yeah...
-NC20...

03:43.319 --> 03:45.800
-No, maybe it's a bit too much.
-Right...

03:45.879 --> 03:47.400
But hang on, hang on...

03:47.479 --> 03:52.439
Maybe an NC20 with an NC13...

03:52.520 --> 03:56.080
If we mix them,
maybe we'll find the right tone...

03:58.560 --> 03:59.520
Hot, isn't it?

04:00.000 --> 04:03.800
-You can't pull faces with a customer.
-I wasn't.

04:03.879 --> 04:06.840
It's hotter over there.

04:07.879 --> 04:08.879
Try her.

04:09.919 --> 04:10.879
Don't act weird.

04:11.840 --> 04:13.759
-Please.
-Okay.

04:15.319 --> 04:17.600
Hi, good afternoon.
Welcome to Fresh.

04:17.680 --> 04:19.079
Can I help you?

04:19.160 --> 04:19.959
I'm here to apologise.

04:20.600 --> 04:22.040
You're not my sister.

04:22.519 --> 04:25.279
-What?
-Say "thank you" and smile.

04:26.839 --> 04:28.439
-Now?
-Obviously.

04:28.519 --> 04:29.639
Thank you very much.

04:29.720 --> 04:31.759
Can you relax and not be so false?

04:32.560 --> 04:34.399
Thank you, that's very kind.

04:34.480 --> 04:36.519
And now you'll buy three products.

04:36.839 --> 04:38.680
-Me?
-Yes, you.

04:39.360 --> 04:43.000
-So your forgiveness has a price?
-The glasses you broke do.

04:44.519 --> 04:47.279
I want this, this...
And this one as well.

04:47.360 --> 04:50.519
No way, you'll buy these
more expensive ones.

04:50.959 --> 04:52.639
Shall I apply them?

04:52.720 --> 04:56.000
-I don't want you applying anything.
-But I will.

04:57.800 --> 04:59.079
So, you're getting married?

05:02.040 --> 05:04.199
Obviously, Mar?.

05:04.600 --> 05:07.120
-Let me see your cheekbones.
-I'm glad.

05:07.199 --> 05:08.800
-Thanks.
-You're rushing into it.

05:08.879 --> 05:09.680
Totally.

05:09.759 --> 05:12.800
You still don't know
if she's the woman of your life.

05:14.160 --> 05:19.120
Seriously? "The woman of your life"?
How can you be so square?

05:19.199 --> 05:21.959
Let's see those cheekbones! Like that.

05:27.680 --> 05:28.560
Hiya!

05:33.319 --> 05:34.519
What are you doing?

05:35.800 --> 05:38.439
I didn't know we had a bag of frozen peas.

05:38.519 --> 05:40.399
Do you like peas?

05:40.480 --> 05:42.639
If you want me to make saut?d peas

05:42.720 --> 05:45.600
with soy sauce, I do a mean dish.

05:46.079 --> 05:48.759
You look really flushed.
Are you okay?

05:48.839 --> 05:50.800
-What's wrong?
-I'm boiling hot.

05:50.879 --> 05:53.000
We'll be late for the meal.

05:53.360 --> 05:55.079
-Julia...
-What do you prefer?

05:55.160 --> 05:57.519
Your car or the metro?

05:57.600 --> 05:58.439
Cut it out.

05:58.519 --> 06:00.360
The car is tricky, because...

06:00.439 --> 06:02.680
If we don't find a place to park...

06:02.759 --> 06:04.079
Not this one, huh?

06:04.160 --> 06:06.000
What the hell is up with you?

06:06.079 --> 06:08.879
Nothing, I went to the gynaecologist.

06:09.639 --> 06:11.399
What's up? Are you all right?

06:12.480 --> 06:14.079
I'm menopausal.

06:21.600 --> 06:23.240
Does that change anything?

06:24.000 --> 06:26.959
Like what? I don't know.
You're menopausal.

06:27.040 --> 06:28.439
Exactly.

06:28.879 --> 06:31.279
Exactly, I have the menopause.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.160
Yes, and...

06:33.240 --> 06:35.639
Well, it's good to know because...

06:35.720 --> 06:39.639
Now we know why
I've had vaginal dryness recently.

06:39.720 --> 06:41.920
Really? You have vaginal dryness?

06:42.000 --> 06:43.120
Let's see...

06:44.959 --> 06:46.279
Hey...

06:49.639 --> 06:52.800
A lot of things
are going to happen, changes.

06:52.879 --> 06:54.120
Yeah? Like what?

06:54.560 --> 06:57.120
Well, I'm going to have...

06:57.680 --> 06:59.160
...mood swings.

07:01.240 --> 07:02.439
What else?

07:03.279 --> 07:05.639
I'll have insomnia, too.

07:05.720 --> 07:07.639
-And what else?
-Bloody hell!

07:09.879 --> 07:12.639
My body will change.

07:12.959 --> 07:15.000
I love your body, you know?

07:15.519 --> 07:16.839
-Like it?
-Yes.

07:16.920 --> 07:18.399
-Like it?
-Yes, don't stop.

07:18.480 --> 07:19.839
-Yes!
-Tell me you like it.

07:19.920 --> 07:21.480
I like it!

07:57.680 --> 08:00.120
When are you going to teach me
line dancing?

08:00.199 --> 08:03.319
-Whenever you want.
-You're all talk, no action.

08:03.759 --> 08:06.879
I hear you paint.
Can you paint me sometime?

08:06.959 --> 08:08.120
I've always wanted that.

08:08.199 --> 08:10.560
I haven't actually painted for months.

08:10.639 --> 08:11.480
Really?

08:11.560 --> 08:13.920
-You can paint me, too.
-Being a painter

08:14.000 --> 08:16.600
is a great way of being in the moment.

08:16.680 --> 08:17.519
-Oh no.
-What?

08:17.600 --> 08:19.560
Cut out the mindfulness.

08:19.639 --> 08:21.720
It's all mindfulness to him.

08:21.800 --> 08:23.720
We're eating? Mindfulness.

08:23.800 --> 08:25.399
-It's true.
-Chatting?

08:25.480 --> 08:27.160
-Mindfulness.
-Mindfulness.

08:27.240 --> 08:29.519
-What is it?
-It's amazing, it's...

08:29.600 --> 08:33.320
...total awareness of your thoughts
and bodily feelings.

08:33.399 --> 08:35.679
It's about being in the moment.

08:35.759 --> 08:39.600
-What? Can't I talk about it?
-Wait. Let's focus on this moment.

08:39.679 --> 08:41.120
I spoke to Trabensol

08:41.200 --> 08:44.559
and they said that the owners
are willing to sell it to us.

08:44.639 --> 08:48.559
Hang on, I have photos.
We can start looking at the space...

08:48.639 --> 08:50.480
-Are you buying a house?
-No, no.

08:50.559 --> 08:53.080
We're building a care home.

08:53.159 --> 08:55.440
For when we retire.

08:55.519 --> 08:57.440
-Didn't Julia tell you?
-No...

08:57.519 --> 09:00.159
Like a commune, but for old people.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.159
-Don't call me old.
-For oldies.

09:02.240 --> 09:03.080
Right back at you.

09:03.159 --> 09:05.759
-Will you go there too?
-I just...

09:05.840 --> 09:08.639
We started the project three years ago.

09:08.720 --> 09:10.960
Before she met you.

09:11.320 --> 09:12.399
Join, do!

09:12.480 --> 09:13.720
-Sure.
-It's the future.

09:13.799 --> 09:16.320
When you talk about retiring...

09:17.519 --> 09:19.720
My brain sort of short-circuits.

09:19.799 --> 09:23.559
We're just thinking ahead,
and what with all the cuts...

09:23.639 --> 09:25.159
-Right.
-Care homes today...

09:25.240 --> 09:26.879
It's a cool Plan B.

09:26.960 --> 09:28.360
-Yes.
-So join in.

09:28.440 --> 09:29.039
Sure.

09:30.519 --> 09:33.279
-I need to pee, the loos are...
-On the left.

09:33.720 --> 09:35.440
Okay, be right back.

09:54.120 --> 09:55.879
A full-on day, right?

09:56.240 --> 09:58.919
The menopause, a care home...

10:00.039 --> 10:01.720
Oh my, oh my...

10:01.799 --> 10:03.600
What will be next?

10:07.840 --> 10:13.039
Why did I just find out you're planning
to live in an old people's home?

10:13.120 --> 10:14.320
That isn't it.

10:14.399 --> 10:17.919
It's a group of independent flats...

10:18.559 --> 10:21.759
...I'll go when I'm around 80.

10:24.159 --> 10:27.360
We're not even married
and you're planning to leave me

10:27.440 --> 10:31.120
and piss off with your mates
and live in a hippy village.

10:31.200 --> 10:32.399
No.

10:32.480 --> 10:34.120
No. You'll leave me.

10:35.120 --> 10:36.879
-What?
-Well, not now.

10:36.960 --> 10:39.559
Obviously, we're getting married.
But...

10:39.639 --> 10:41.639
When I get older...

10:41.720 --> 10:44.159
you'll look for other options, fine,

10:44.240 --> 10:47.399
there's no need to feel guilty,
I'd do the same.

10:52.559 --> 10:54.960
What will happen when you're old

10:55.039 --> 10:56.720
is that I'll be old too

10:56.799 --> 10:59.639
and we'll end up
two old menopausal ladies.

10:59.720 --> 11:03.200
Our fannies will dry out,
we'll have bunions,

11:03.279 --> 11:07.399
and we'll have cream scones
for tea like a couple of old dears.

11:07.480 --> 11:09.440
-What do you say?
-Old dears?

11:11.759 --> 11:12.919
Why?

11:34.519 --> 11:36.679
CO-HOUSING,
A LIFESTYLE

11:36.759 --> 11:40.039
Of all those things,
the one I feel most envious about

11:40.440 --> 11:42.360
is that they're planning something together.

11:42.840 --> 11:44.360
They share a project.

11:44.919 --> 11:48.039
Why does everyone have a life project
except me?

11:49.600 --> 11:50.919
What's a lif...?

11:52.919 --> 11:54.720
What's a life...?

12:03.039 --> 12:04.200
What's a life project?

12:04.759 --> 12:07.039
What Cris has, for example,

12:07.120 --> 12:08.320
with Pablo.

12:08.399 --> 12:11.000
They met, fell in love, shacked up,

12:11.080 --> 12:12.639
they have two daughters...

12:12.720 --> 12:16.840
Did they have a crisis?
Yes, but they're sorting it out.

12:16.919 --> 12:18.919
I don't believe it!

12:19.000 --> 12:21.440
I'd prefer your case
a thousand times more.

12:21.519 --> 12:24.159
I'm with a couple who use their kids
to negotiate.

12:24.240 --> 12:25.720
-And it sucks.
-Right.

12:25.799 --> 12:29.159
I didn't even want to study Law.
I liked Marine Science.

12:29.240 --> 12:30.519
Dad wouldn't let me.

12:30.600 --> 12:32.559
I wanted to work for
Architectes sans fronti?es.

12:32.639 --> 12:34.080
-Yeah?
-And here I am.

12:36.120 --> 12:38.080
-Here we are.
-Here we are.

12:39.919 --> 12:41.159
Hey...

12:41.600 --> 12:42.840
Can I tell you a secret?

12:45.039 --> 12:46.039
Sure.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.759
I was totally convinced
you didn't like me.

12:50.360 --> 12:52.159
Well that isn't true at all.

12:52.519 --> 12:54.639
In fact, I quite like you.

12:56.240 --> 12:57.559
I'm glad.
I like you too.

12:58.200 --> 12:58.720
Oh...

13:00.360 --> 13:03.799
All right,
I confessed something to you.

13:03.879 --> 13:06.159
Now it's your turn to confess something.

13:06.480 --> 13:08.120
-Okay.
-Go ahead.

13:08.200 --> 13:09.480
Okay.

13:12.039 --> 13:13.159
What?

13:14.120 --> 13:17.600
My husband and I are opening up
our relationship.

13:19.600 --> 13:21.120
-Wow!
-Wow!

13:23.159 --> 13:27.080
But, sort of like...
hooking up with other people?

13:27.159 --> 13:29.440
-Something like that.
-That is major.

13:29.519 --> 13:31.480
-It's major.
-It's major.

13:33.159 --> 13:35.240
How about a night cap somewhere else?

13:38.519 --> 13:40.960
No, I can't. I have an early start.

13:41.039 --> 13:42.200
-What time is it?
-Eleven.

13:42.279 --> 13:43.159
-Eleven!
-Super late.

13:43.240 --> 13:45.600
Just popping to the loo.

13:45.679 --> 13:47.200
Hey, by the way...

13:48.399 --> 13:50.679
I think this is really cool.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.639
What is really cool?

13:53.200 --> 13:56.200
Meeting up with colleagues
to let off steam.

13:56.519 --> 13:58.360
Thanks, I mean it.

14:07.399 --> 14:08.919
-Hi, honey.
-Hi.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.600
Are the kids asleep?

14:10.679 --> 14:13.320
Fed, bathed and sound asleep.

14:13.399 --> 14:15.159
-Great.
-I'm fab, right?

14:15.240 --> 14:16.399
Really great.

14:16.480 --> 14:18.679
Five more years and we're even.

14:19.039 --> 14:21.120
-I'll take a shower.
-Okay.

14:22.639 --> 14:24.600
But don't get the wrong idea.

14:24.679 --> 14:26.639
-Like what?
-Something or other.

14:26.720 --> 14:28.360
Yeah, that I hate washing up.

14:28.440 --> 14:31.559
-Okay, I'll hop in the shower.
-Okay.

14:39.919 --> 14:41.600
Were you with someone?

14:42.320 --> 14:43.799
You said not to tell you.

14:43.879 --> 14:45.080
That's true.

14:49.320 --> 14:51.559
-So it's on?
-Isn't that what we agreed?

14:51.639 --> 14:53.879
Yeah, but it caught me by surprise.

14:53.960 --> 14:55.600
I don't want details.

14:55.679 --> 14:57.000
Okay, okay, okay...

14:57.080 --> 15:01.200
All right, tell me about it,
but nothing after today.

15:01.279 --> 15:02.440
I'm ready.

15:02.799 --> 15:04.399
-Nothing happened.
-Okay.

15:04.480 --> 15:07.000
I had a drink with a colleague.

15:07.080 --> 15:09.240
Okay.
Then there's nothing to tell.

15:09.320 --> 15:11.600
-Nothing to tell.
-So, end of story.

15:12.360 --> 15:14.399
We're not looking for a hook-up
each week, right?

15:14.919 --> 15:17.559
No, of course...
When it happens.

15:18.759 --> 15:20.480
When it happens.

15:21.519 --> 15:24.320
-Why the saucepan?
-I don't know.

15:24.879 --> 15:27.399
-I'm really nervous.
-Me too.

15:27.840 --> 15:29.200
Leave the pan.

15:30.360 --> 15:32.000
-Crap!
-What a bitch!

15:32.080 --> 15:34.480
Yeah, it was a gift from your mother.

15:35.320 --> 15:38.000
If my Mom finds out, we're dead.

15:38.080 --> 15:39.080
Sweetie.

15:39.159 --> 15:41.399
-Not a word to Gran.
-Top secret.

15:41.480 --> 15:42.879
That's it.

15:43.279 --> 15:45.519
Why are you glued to your cell?

15:45.600 --> 15:48.320
Let's see what's on the market.

15:48.919 --> 15:51.000
This guy looks like Brad Pitt.

15:51.080 --> 15:53.480
Excuse me, Brad Pitt is over 50.

15:53.559 --> 15:56.200
-Whatever, he's a hunk.
-He's not a hunk.

15:56.279 --> 15:57.679
-He's old.
-Mery...

15:57.759 --> 15:59.000
-Got him.
-What?

16:02.240 --> 16:02.960
Why's he here?

16:03.039 --> 16:03.919
Same as you.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.759
He posted sexy photos.

16:05.840 --> 16:07.039
Let me see.

16:08.039 --> 16:09.200
-Did you tap "like"?
-Yes.

16:09.279 --> 16:10.720
But why?
This is my phone.

16:10.799 --> 16:13.159
What is it with you?
He'll think it was me.

16:13.240 --> 16:16.240
Great, now you can go to his place,
not like strangers.

16:16.320 --> 16:17.960
Right, you two-timer...

16:18.039 --> 16:20.759
Hey, mutual accord!
Plus, nothing happened.

16:20.840 --> 16:24.039
You have a husband and lovers,
and I'm totally alone...

16:24.120 --> 16:27.440
-Seen a lamp that you like, sweetie?
-No.

16:27.519 --> 16:29.960
Run over there and take a look.

16:30.039 --> 16:31.840
-If she heard, you're dead.
-She didn't.

16:31.919 --> 16:33.240
-Excuse me.
-Yes...

16:33.320 --> 16:35.279
-It's been discontinued.
-Oh dear.

16:35.360 --> 16:36.559
And it was popular.

16:38.480 --> 16:39.519
Here.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.279
Let me see...

16:45.320 --> 16:46.759
No!

16:53.120 --> 16:55.600
CRIS: Hey, Pablo. How's your dinner?

16:55.679 --> 16:59.799
I wait up for you or go to bed?

17:04.279 --> 17:07.920
So, what you two got there?
Let's have a look...

17:08.000 --> 17:09.720
Oh, that's so pretty!

17:09.799 --> 17:11.880
What are you drawing, sweetie?

17:11.960 --> 17:13.559
-Zombies?
-No.

17:13.640 --> 17:15.480
Your boyfriends and girlfriends.

17:15.559 --> 17:19.000
-Whose, sweetie?
-Yes, this is you and Daddy.

17:19.079 --> 17:21.839
These are his girlfriends,
these are your boyfriends.

17:22.559 --> 17:24.440
No, it isn't like that.

17:24.519 --> 17:27.119
-Yes.
-Mommy and Daddy are a couple.

17:27.200 --> 17:28.400
We have each other.

17:28.480 --> 17:32.160
But Mar? said you had
lots of boyfriends and girlfriends.

17:32.240 --> 17:34.079
-She didn't say that.
-Yes.

17:34.160 --> 17:36.480
No, she said we had lots of friends.

17:36.559 --> 17:38.200
Do you have lots too?

17:38.279 --> 17:39.319
-Yes.
-You see?

17:39.400 --> 17:41.480
Mommy and Daddy do, too.

17:41.559 --> 17:42.720
-Okay?
-Okay.

17:42.799 --> 17:45.000
-Do you know what's most important?
-No.

17:45.079 --> 17:47.680
That we both love you to bits.

17:48.839 --> 17:51.920
Time to go and brush our teeth.
Right, Martina?

17:52.000 --> 17:54.240
Off we go, chop-chop!
Take her hand.

17:54.319 --> 17:55.799
This way.

17:55.880 --> 17:58.880
-I'll be right there, okay?
-Okay.

18:25.079 --> 18:26.759
Did something happen?

18:28.119 --> 18:29.960
Want me to tell you?

18:33.160 --> 18:37.079
Something happened.
It's not important, but it happened.

18:48.720 --> 18:51.000
And now they're better than ever.

18:52.200 --> 18:55.000
Their marital crisis is helping them to...

18:55.079 --> 18:58.640
strengthen what they've been building
together all these years.

18:59.240 --> 19:00.920
That makes me envious, too.

19:02.160 --> 19:03.039
-Yes?
-Hi.

19:03.119 --> 19:06.720
-I've come for the lamp.
-Right. I've got it inside.

19:09.400 --> 19:10.559
Sorry...

19:11.119 --> 19:12.680
Do I know you?

19:14.680 --> 19:15.480
I know who you are.

19:16.200 --> 19:17.680
Got a lighter for me?

19:18.119 --> 19:19.160
Funeral home?
Lighter?

19:19.599 --> 19:20.759
I gave you a light...

19:20.839 --> 19:21.839
Need a light?

19:22.599 --> 19:23.799
Thanks.

19:24.720 --> 19:27.200
I gave you my number.
You never called.

19:29.119 --> 19:30.920
I didn't call you.

19:33.440 --> 19:35.799
So...
Do you have the lamp?

19:35.880 --> 19:38.000
Yeah, I want to sell it and...

19:38.079 --> 19:40.400
I'm cooking.
Do you mind coming in?

19:40.480 --> 19:41.640
-Oh...
-Do you?

19:41.720 --> 19:42.920
-No, no...
-Fine.

19:43.279 --> 19:44.480
Sorry for interrupting.

19:45.039 --> 19:46.200
What about you?

19:47.119 --> 19:48.359
Meaning?

19:48.440 --> 19:52.279
You've talked about your sister,
your friend... And you?

19:54.160 --> 19:56.839
How have you been all this time?

19:57.559 --> 19:58.960
Well...

19:59.920 --> 20:01.440
A lot of stuff happened.

20:01.519 --> 20:03.440
-Got him, Mery.
-What?

20:04.400 --> 20:07.039
-Why's he here?
-Same as you.

20:07.119 --> 20:08.960
He posted sexy photos.

20:09.039 --> 20:10.920
Let me see!

20:12.279 --> 20:13.279
Did you tap "like"?

21:04.000 --> 21:05.599
-Hang on a sec.
-What?

21:05.680 --> 21:06.880
Nothing.

21:07.839 --> 21:09.359
I'd rather you shove it in.

21:09.440 --> 21:10.920
-I can do both.
-I know.

21:11.000 --> 21:11.640
Are you sure?

21:11.720 --> 21:13.960
-Yes, I want you to shove it in.
-Ok.

21:16.839 --> 21:19.440
You see, after giving birth,

21:19.519 --> 21:21.559
and a baby's head
is the size of a melon,

21:21.640 --> 21:25.119
I had to have stitches
because of a tear.

21:25.720 --> 21:28.519
I'm sort of freaking out
about penetration.

21:28.599 --> 21:31.599
-It won't hurt you?
-I don't know. No, it won't.

21:31.680 --> 21:34.000
I want it inside.
Just stick it in.

21:38.440 --> 21:40.480
-What's up?
-Well you know...

21:40.559 --> 21:44.359
All that talk about penetration,
scars and melons...

21:44.440 --> 21:44.960
Right.

21:45.039 --> 21:47.240
-There we go.
-No, wait a sec...

21:48.000 --> 21:49.599
-Wait...
-Now...

21:51.680 --> 21:53.359
-That was quick.
-Great.

21:53.440 --> 21:54.799
Right?

21:54.880 --> 21:56.720
-Ready?
-Yeah.

21:56.799 --> 21:58.720
-Wait, slowly.
-Slowly.

21:58.799 --> 22:00.240
-You're in charge.
-Okay.

22:00.319 --> 22:01.279
Here goes...

22:05.079 --> 22:06.720
-Does it hurt?
-Ouch!

22:06.799 --> 22:08.599
A bit, but it's nice.

22:08.680 --> 22:09.920
-Really?
-Yes, it's nice.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.079
-So I stop?
-No, no. I want it in me.

22:20.920 --> 22:22.880
Since when do you have Tinder?

22:22.960 --> 22:25.720
Well, I take a look now and again.

22:26.400 --> 22:27.720
What about when we met?

22:30.279 --> 22:32.400
That means yes.
Fair enough.

22:32.480 --> 22:35.240
-But we hardly saw each other.
-No, that's true.

22:37.039 --> 22:38.359
Any good?

22:38.920 --> 22:42.720
-I'm new to all this.
-There are good and bad spells.

22:42.799 --> 22:44.799
Never as good as this, though.

22:45.240 --> 22:47.440
No need to suck up to me.

22:47.839 --> 22:49.279
Fancy some dinner?

22:50.319 --> 22:52.240
I have to pick up Juanito.

22:52.319 --> 22:53.880
He's at Cris' place.

22:53.960 --> 22:55.960
I have a son, remember?

22:56.799 --> 22:58.119
True enough.

23:04.119 --> 23:05.640
Good, all sorted.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.279
Great, Juanito.

23:09.599 --> 23:12.759
XOS?: How's your day going?
Want a repeat?

23:19.319 --> 23:20.640
-Hi.
-<i>Hi, Gari.</i>

23:21.160 --> 23:21.640
<i>Hi.</i>

23:21.720 --> 23:25.279
I'd rather you didn? come tonight,
I'm super tired.

23:25.359 --> 23:28.440
<i>I've had a headache all day,</i>
<i>I'll go to bed early.</i>

23:28.519 --> 23:30.039
Okay, but tomorrow is on.

23:30.119 --> 23:32.519
-Yeah, sure, come by.
-<i>Okay.</i>

23:32.599 --> 23:33.880
Okay.

23:33.960 --> 23:36.519
-Bye, Mar?.
-<i>Bye.</i>

23:47.160 --> 23:50.240
-Do you know what I really fancy?
-What?

23:52.400 --> 23:53.160
A shower.

23:54.799 --> 23:55.839
Okay.

23:55.920 --> 23:56.880
Let's do it.

23:57.640 --> 23:59.319
By myself.

24:00.799 --> 24:01.720
Oh.

24:10.480 --> 24:13.319
Starting a project with this guy?

24:15.559 --> 24:16.599
Well...

24:17.680 --> 24:18.799
More or less.

24:19.680 --> 24:21.960
You see... It's not easy.

24:23.319 --> 24:24.240
Mar?...

24:24.319 --> 24:26.960
Why did you
come here the first time?

24:27.319 --> 24:29.119
I thought I was depressed.

24:29.200 --> 24:32.480
You realize you haven't talked
about your son at all?

24:32.559 --> 24:34.759
I have other things going on too.

24:35.480 --> 24:36.759
Let's try something.

24:37.119 --> 24:40.240
-What?
-Look at him and tell me what you feel.

24:40.720 --> 24:42.240
He's busy, best not.

24:42.319 --> 24:43.400
Go on, try it.

24:45.279 --> 24:46.559
Well, he's my son.

24:46.640 --> 24:49.359
I think: "He'll need changing,
he'll cry.

24:49.440 --> 24:51.039
He'll cry in the middle of this."

24:51.119 --> 24:52.599
I didn't ask you that.

24:52.680 --> 24:54.440
Tell me what you feel.

24:54.519 --> 24:57.759
Time's nearly up,
someone'll come in and then...

24:57.839 --> 24:59.319
There's nobody.

24:59.400 --> 25:00.519
Nobody.

25:00.599 --> 25:02.799
I don't want to, this isn't about him.

25:02.880 --> 25:05.319
-It's about me.
-Want to leave like last time?

25:05.720 --> 25:08.359
Or stay and see what happens?

25:13.000 --> 25:14.519
Go on, look at him.

25:18.680 --> 25:20.079
Breathe...

25:23.119 --> 25:24.839
Take your time.

25:26.640 --> 25:27.960
And tell me...

25:29.680 --> 25:30.880
...what you feel.

25:38.880 --> 25:40.000
Guilt.

25:42.200 --> 25:43.400
Because...?

25:49.119 --> 25:51.200
Because I don't feel anything.
