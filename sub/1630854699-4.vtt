WEBVTT

00:28.778 --> 00:30.822
That is southeast.

01:04.439 --> 01:05.899
You trust that thing?

01:06.483 --> 01:07.400
Yes.

01:07.942 --> 01:11.196
How do you know your marks
and sightings are telling you the truth?

01:11.905 --> 01:13.740
Each day I am doubtful of its gifts.

01:14.824 --> 01:16.576
And each day it proves me wrong.

01:19.662 --> 01:20.663
Funny.

01:21.706 --> 01:23.666
I never thought of you as a scholar.

01:25.585 --> 01:28.296
Or you as a fur trader, but here we are.

01:30.465 --> 01:31.925
-The ropes are secure?
-Hmm.

01:33.218 --> 01:34.636
You're good to begin.

01:34.719 --> 01:35.595
I am worried.

01:38.598 --> 01:42.393
When the river reaches the Lake
of the Mountains we will be halfway.

01:50.777 --> 01:51.653
What is that?

01:53.238 --> 01:54.239
Easy.

01:55.740 --> 01:57.242
What is that noise?

01:58.076 --> 01:59.828
It is the ice talking.

02:28.064 --> 02:29.399
Your Highness summoned me.

02:30.567 --> 02:33.027
I'm aware of your relationship
with Lady Aelfwynn,

02:33.111 --> 02:34.279
and have been for weeks.

02:34.362 --> 02:37.407
-You wooed her in secret?
-That should not surprise you.

02:37.490 --> 02:41.536
What surprises me is that you would
embark on such a perilous relationship.

02:41.619 --> 02:44.914
If Your Highness refers
to Aelfwynn's position in your household,

02:44.998 --> 02:47.500
I can assure you
that she does not spy for me,

02:47.584 --> 02:50.295
for such an arrangement
could work both ways.

02:50.837 --> 02:54.299
We kept it a secret until I could obtain
your husband's blessing of marriage,

02:54.382 --> 02:58.553
which I have just received,
and intended to share.

02:59.137 --> 03:00.889
What do you know of her background?

03:02.307 --> 03:05.768
I know she has three sisters.
All older and married.

03:06.561 --> 03:08.980
Her father was displaced, like many,

03:09.063 --> 03:11.232
when King Canute
placed Jarl Nori in Northumbria.

03:11.316 --> 03:12.609
Is that all?

03:13.192 --> 03:14.861
If you're asking if I love her,

03:16.946 --> 03:18.072
the answer is yes.

03:19.198 --> 03:20.700
What would you say if I told you

03:20.783 --> 03:24.120
her brother was the man
who tried to kill me?

03:24.203 --> 03:26.956
That you're wrong. She doesn't have one.
She would've told me.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.959
Half-brother.
And she has confirmed it with me.

03:30.043 --> 03:34.088
Are you suggesting that Aelfwynn was
involved in the plot against your life?

03:34.172 --> 03:38.301
Actually, no, Earl Godwin.
I believe it is you who was behind it.

03:38.384 --> 03:41.512
May I remind Your Highness
that it was my hand that saved your life.

03:42.138 --> 03:44.974
Had I wanted you dead,
would I not have allowed it to happen?

03:45.058 --> 03:47.936
That is exactly the question
I've not been able to answer.

03:48.019 --> 03:50.188
Then take me to the dungeon
and ask me there.

03:50.855 --> 03:52.815
It is not you I intend to take there.

03:55.818 --> 03:57.362
You cannot be serious.

04:00.573 --> 04:03.534
If the roles were reversed
and it was your life at risk,

04:03.618 --> 04:05.995
would you not do
the same thing to learn the truth?

04:08.498 --> 04:09.624
I thought so.

04:10.750 --> 04:13.002
Your Highness, I beg you.

04:14.212 --> 04:17.757
Do not make Aelfwynn
the battleground in our differences.

04:19.050 --> 04:22.220
I have my failings,
that is true, but she is innocent.

04:23.096 --> 04:26.766
Give me time to prove that to you,
and to find the answers you ask for.

04:28.059 --> 04:29.227
You've had time.

04:31.062 --> 04:32.272
It is now up.

04:43.825 --> 04:46.536
-Deep as my elbow.
-Three hands thick.

04:47.662 --> 04:49.747
We have plenty of time before the thaw.

04:49.831 --> 04:51.040
Maybe in Norway.

04:51.833 --> 04:53.209
What concerns you?

04:53.293 --> 04:55.420
The ice dam breaking.

04:55.503 --> 04:56.879
What is the ice dam?

04:56.963 --> 05:00.091
It is a wall of ice
that moves like a wave,

05:00.174 --> 05:02.135
crushing everything in its path.

05:04.053 --> 05:08.558
If we are out here when it appears,
we will not have time to escape it.

05:08.641 --> 05:10.601
How much time do we have?

05:10.685 --> 05:12.645
A week? A day?

05:12.729 --> 05:16.190
The river is long.
It may already be on its way.

05:16.274 --> 05:17.734
What do you suggest?

05:17.817 --> 05:20.903
That we move this sled off the river
and wait until it passes.

05:20.987 --> 05:23.823
We're a day's journey
from the lake which is free of ice.

05:23.906 --> 05:25.033
You said so yourself.

05:26.075 --> 05:28.870
For all we know
the Pechenegs are all around us.

05:28.953 --> 05:30.580
We take our chances and push on.

05:31.748 --> 05:32.832
Load up!

06:27.386 --> 06:28.387
Come.

06:42.151 --> 06:44.779
What have you found? Where does she go?

06:44.862 --> 06:46.364
She goes nowhere.

06:46.447 --> 06:48.699
Just the forest
to collect herbs and roots.

06:49.617 --> 06:51.160
And does she see the refugees?

06:54.038 --> 06:55.206
Sometimes.

06:55.289 --> 06:59.085
They treat her as priestess,
with respect, as Harekr wishes--

06:59.168 --> 07:01.212
She should not see them. It is bad.

07:01.295 --> 07:04.090
I work with them, Mother.
They're not bad people.

07:04.173 --> 07:06.634
I think Freydis is right.

07:06.717 --> 07:08.803
They should be allowed
to come to Jomsborg.

07:11.013 --> 07:12.265
Is there a girl?

07:15.309 --> 07:16.352
What if there was?

07:19.230 --> 07:21.274
Harekr would not approve.

07:21.357 --> 07:24.652
Maybe… it is time for a change.

07:27.613 --> 07:30.491
-I think it's going to be a boy.
-You think so?

07:32.660 --> 07:34.120
Yes. I think so.

07:45.256 --> 07:46.299
She has told you.

07:46.841 --> 07:49.635
It means nothing to me.
I know that you're innocent.

07:52.138 --> 07:53.222
Oh, thank God.

07:57.185 --> 07:59.854
I was worried that when she told you,
you would abandon me.

07:59.937 --> 08:02.940
I would never leave you.
In the eyes of God, you are my wife.

08:03.024 --> 08:05.276
I've already sent word to Canute

08:05.359 --> 08:08.029
explaining the situation
and begging for your release,

08:08.905 --> 08:10.698
but until then, you must be strong

08:11.991 --> 08:13.367
and listen to me carefully.

08:14.660 --> 08:16.496
The queen is going to question you.

08:16.579 --> 08:19.790
I'm not afraid.
I've already told her the truth.

08:19.874 --> 08:21.626
This is very different.

08:21.709 --> 08:24.128
She isn't interested in the truth or you.

08:25.505 --> 08:26.964
This is about me.

08:27.048 --> 08:28.049
You?

08:28.716 --> 08:30.468
But you knew nothing of my brother.

08:31.052 --> 08:34.263
-He was not a part of my family.
-I believe you, but the queen does not.

08:34.347 --> 08:38.100
She feels that I've manipulated you
into joining a crime against her life,

08:38.184 --> 08:40.061
and she intends to prove that.

08:45.358 --> 08:48.903
I have nothing to fear.
I will tell the truth.

08:48.986 --> 08:52.156
No. You must tell her that it was me.

08:53.199 --> 08:54.617
Tell her I was behind it.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.035
That would be a lie.

08:56.994 --> 08:59.288
Then she would take you
from me and I'd have nothing.

09:05.795 --> 09:06.837
I'm going with her.

09:06.921 --> 09:09.131
No. Queen's orders.

09:09.840 --> 09:11.050
Do not worry.

09:11.759 --> 09:14.971
I will tell the truth.
For it is all that I know.

09:46.586 --> 09:47.920
It's beautiful.

09:48.462 --> 09:50.047
Was it a gift form Earl Godwin?

09:52.967 --> 09:57.054
He gave it to me as a symbol
of his love… and the future.

09:57.138 --> 09:59.348
You're lucky to have felt real love.

10:00.141 --> 10:01.309
You will too.

10:05.396 --> 10:07.690
Canute wants me
to marry a prince or a king.

10:07.773 --> 10:09.942
He does not care if I ever feel love.

10:12.778 --> 10:15.156
God knows your goodness, Gytha.

10:16.532 --> 10:18.326
And will take care of you.

10:19.785 --> 10:22.288
If something should happen to me…

10:25.541 --> 10:27.460
will you give this back to him for me?

10:29.587 --> 10:30.630
And tell him…

10:32.381 --> 10:33.966
that my love never wavered.

10:41.682 --> 10:43.059
The river is narrowing.

10:44.393 --> 10:47.104
It means we are nearing
the Lake of the Mountains.

10:49.899 --> 10:51.192
I know you are smiling.

10:53.027 --> 10:56.155
Should I not be? We're nearly there.

10:57.406 --> 10:59.158
When we reach the lake,

10:59.241 --> 11:00.743
I will smile with you.

11:03.079 --> 11:05.164
Describe Constantinople again.

11:05.748 --> 11:06.582
It's big.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.126
Much larger than Novgorod.

11:11.504 --> 11:16.258
With a massive wall around it
and brilliant sunlight.

11:17.134 --> 11:18.677
I'm excited to go back.

11:20.471 --> 11:21.847
You will like it.

11:24.892 --> 11:25.726
I hope.

11:43.077 --> 11:45.329
Come here!

11:50.960 --> 11:52.128
Stop!

11:54.296 --> 11:56.048
You rely too much on the sword.

11:56.924 --> 12:00.302
The axe is a Viking's weapon of choice.

12:22.324 --> 12:23.826
Let me try again.

12:27.371 --> 12:28.289
Jarl Olaf!

12:36.338 --> 12:37.298
This is Gutlag.

12:37.381 --> 12:40.593
He's just come from the east
with news of your brother.

12:40.676 --> 12:42.970
-Where is he? Jomsborg?
-No.

12:43.053 --> 12:44.346
He's in Rus.

12:44.430 --> 12:48.767
I saw him in Novgorod over a month ago,
meeting with Yaroslav "The Wise."

12:49.477 --> 12:51.770
He was with the Greenlander,
Leif Eriksson.

12:52.354 --> 12:54.023
And the woman, Freydis?

12:54.106 --> 12:55.774
There was no woman with them.

12:55.858 --> 12:56.859
Are you sure?

12:56.942 --> 12:57.985
Positive.

12:59.570 --> 13:00.571
Prepare the ships.

13:00.654 --> 13:01.697
Of course.

13:07.786 --> 13:09.580
You're leaving again?

13:10.080 --> 13:11.040
Yes.

13:12.541 --> 13:14.668
If Harald is in Novgorod,

13:14.752 --> 13:18.339
it means he's meeting with our uncle
to raise an army against Kattegat.

13:18.839 --> 13:21.091
It is not wise to wait for it to arrive.

13:23.677 --> 13:26.514
Go gather your things.
We're going to the Rus.

13:28.599 --> 13:29.475
Here.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.230
And how long will you be gone?

13:35.314 --> 13:37.107
Do I sense that I will be missed?

13:37.191 --> 13:39.568
Well, I was just getting used to you.

14:51.015 --> 14:51.974
Amen.

15:01.150 --> 15:02.776
I've already told you everything.

15:03.485 --> 15:05.487
I did not know my brother was in London.

15:05.571 --> 15:08.365
I did not know he wished to kill you.

15:08.449 --> 15:10.993
-Shh. Aelfwynn.
-If I did, I would have warned you.

15:11.076 --> 15:11.911
Aelfwynn.

15:12.578 --> 15:14.788
-I do not want to hurt you.

15:14.872 --> 15:16.332
Then believe me.

15:18.626 --> 15:21.086
I have already told you the truth.

15:21.712 --> 15:23.088
It is all I know.

15:24.965 --> 15:26.759
I think you know more about Godwin.

15:30.721 --> 15:32.932
And we must discover
what you know together.

15:38.729 --> 15:42.733
Now, what did Godwin
tell you about the Bear?

15:44.944 --> 15:46.487
I have never heard that name.

15:59.583 --> 16:00.751
It's the truth, it…

16:01.585 --> 16:02.878
I'll ask again.

16:04.254 --> 16:05.172
The Bear.

16:06.256 --> 16:07.675
I know nothing.

16:23.107 --> 16:26.151
I think the Emperor
would be interested in my girls.

16:26.235 --> 16:28.404
They are exotic and all pure.

16:31.281 --> 16:34.368
I have my own buyers,
of course, in the Valley of Lamentations,

16:34.451 --> 16:37.663
but you look like a man who could
put in a good word for me at court.

16:40.040 --> 16:42.042
A word that would be rewarded.

16:43.168 --> 16:44.378
I hope you rot in hell.

16:44.461 --> 16:46.839
What did you say to me, boy?

16:50.259 --> 16:51.593
Do that again!

16:51.677 --> 16:52.803
Stop!

16:52.886 --> 16:55.264
He's only saying
what is obvious to all of us.

16:56.432 --> 16:58.058
Now go away and leave us alone.

16:58.142 --> 17:01.729
Control your slave or I will teach him
the lessons you have failed to!

17:06.608 --> 17:09.611
Come, come. Go.

17:09.695 --> 17:11.905
"The energy of the mind…

17:13.407 --> 17:15.492
is the essence…

17:16.994 --> 17:18.787
of life."

17:19.371 --> 17:21.123
I never thought of life like that.

17:22.499 --> 17:24.710
That is what learning is about.

17:25.294 --> 17:28.547
A constant movement of ideas.

17:37.556 --> 17:38.682
Easy.

17:45.731 --> 17:47.608
No, stop! Save their strength.

17:51.487 --> 17:53.989
Everyone out. We have to lighten the boat.

17:54.865 --> 17:57.534
Kaysan, you and Batu get us logs.

17:58.243 --> 18:00.746
Dorn, Brigtoc, mind the horses.

18:00.829 --> 18:01.955
Yeah, right away.

18:03.457 --> 18:04.500
I'll smile yet.

18:07.669 --> 18:08.670
Lighten the load.

18:28.398 --> 18:29.399
Nice try.

18:30.359 --> 18:32.402
I know where you want to put that axe.

18:39.326 --> 18:41.787
Get ready to push! Now!

18:44.873 --> 18:46.208
It's rising!

18:59.346 --> 19:01.348
-Again!
-Harald, the horses need to rest.

19:01.431 --> 19:02.516
We cannot stop.

19:02.599 --> 19:04.601
Once night falls,
the river will freeze again.

19:04.685 --> 19:07.521
The sled will be trapped. Let's try again.

19:27.708 --> 19:29.710
Kaysan, a new log.

19:31.753 --> 19:34.214
No. We need to rest.

19:35.924 --> 19:37.217
Water the horses.

19:37.843 --> 19:39.219
We will take a break.

19:52.691 --> 19:54.610
-I'll ask you again.

19:55.569 --> 19:57.029
Why are you protecting him?

19:58.780 --> 20:00.908
I am not protecting him.

20:02.659 --> 20:04.369
I'm telling you the truth.

20:04.453 --> 20:06.163
He has used you.

20:07.122 --> 20:09.041
Or maybe you have misjudged him.

20:09.666 --> 20:10.584
No.

20:10.667 --> 20:14.838
He found a place in court
by murder and deceit.

20:14.922 --> 20:16.673
But not with me.

20:18.467 --> 20:21.803
He trusts me. He can tell me things.

20:22.471 --> 20:23.513
Such as?

20:24.848 --> 20:27.726
His youth in Sussex.

20:29.436 --> 20:31.813
His father and his hatred of him.

20:32.648 --> 20:33.482
And me?

20:36.276 --> 20:40.489
He has never spoken a word
against Your Highness.

20:41.698 --> 20:42.991
Never!

20:43.075 --> 20:45.369
Search your memory again.

21:04.680 --> 21:07.224
There's nothing there to find!

21:15.857 --> 21:17.067
Go ahead.

21:18.068 --> 21:19.278
Say it.

21:21.238 --> 21:24.449
If you're asking me to blame you,
I wouldn't start with today.

21:38.880 --> 21:40.299
I cannot help it.

21:41.258 --> 21:44.553
I need to get there.
I have so much to prove.

21:45.554 --> 21:49.141
But I should have listened to Kurya.

21:50.517 --> 21:51.727
And stopped.

21:52.352 --> 21:55.314
You think you're the only one
who is desperate to get there?

21:57.858 --> 21:58.900
Look at them.

22:01.611 --> 22:03.989
They all want to get to Constantinople.

22:06.241 --> 22:08.869
-You're just the loudest.

22:13.206 --> 22:14.541
Do not stop now.

22:22.341 --> 22:23.342
What's that?

22:24.009 --> 22:26.219
-More Greek?
-No.

22:26.970 --> 22:28.180
No, it's Latin.

22:30.015 --> 22:34.144
It means "fortune favors the bold."

22:37.022 --> 22:38.023
That's you.

22:45.572 --> 22:46.948
We need more wood.

22:57.626 --> 22:59.419
You're a dangerous man.

23:00.754 --> 23:02.047
I'm a calculating man.

23:15.477 --> 23:16.853
Do you really have to go?

23:18.730 --> 23:19.564
Yes.

23:20.565 --> 23:21.900
But I will return.

23:24.653 --> 23:25.862
Make sure you do.

23:37.249 --> 23:39.543
What were you doing
in my mother's chambers?

23:41.378 --> 23:43.004
I was simply saying goodbye.

23:43.088 --> 23:46.800
When my father leaves for battle,
he never spends so long saying goodbye.

23:46.883 --> 23:48.009
Yes, well…

23:48.760 --> 23:51.429
Your father is a king.

23:52.305 --> 23:55.142
He's much more efficient
in his goodbyes than I am.

23:56.476 --> 23:57.686
Are you ready?

23:58.812 --> 23:59.646
I am.

24:09.781 --> 24:10.615
Now!

24:15.495 --> 24:16.955
Move!

24:23.420 --> 24:24.671
Push!

24:41.938 --> 24:44.399
It worked! We did it!

24:44.482 --> 24:45.317
Yes!

24:49.196 --> 24:51.531
All right! Let's go!

25:05.462 --> 25:06.463
What is this?

25:13.386 --> 25:14.346
It's coming.

25:15.263 --> 25:17.057
The ice dam has broken.

25:17.140 --> 25:19.517
Release the horses. Cut the boat free now!

25:19.601 --> 25:21.311
Kaysan. The mallets!

25:31.780 --> 25:32.697
Go, go!

25:35.283 --> 25:36.409
-My coat!
-I've got it.

25:41.665 --> 25:43.750
Move!

25:46.711 --> 25:49.130
-Go.
-Move!

25:52.217 --> 25:53.635
Hold the coat.

25:58.014 --> 25:59.391
Help!

26:07.983 --> 26:10.735
You have to hold on.
You have to hold! Pull!

26:19.869 --> 26:21.288
Everyone onboard!

26:27.127 --> 26:28.128
Get back!

26:30.088 --> 26:31.131
Father!

26:31.715 --> 26:33.133
Harald!

26:33.216 --> 26:34.134
Run!

26:38.388 --> 26:39.597
No!

26:53.737 --> 26:55.864
Father!

26:58.575 --> 26:59.743
Get me in!

26:59.826 --> 27:01.661
Brace yourselves!

27:11.880 --> 27:12.922
Oars in!

27:33.068 --> 27:33.902
Here.

27:34.944 --> 27:35.820
I'm sorry.

28:19.114 --> 28:23.576
He lost everything, but his ring.

28:23.660 --> 28:25.203
His ring?

28:26.287 --> 28:28.289
He gave it away, he told me.

28:30.250 --> 28:31.876
What else did he tell you?

28:46.433 --> 28:47.976
What do you talk about…

28:49.811 --> 28:51.604
in the quiet moments?

28:54.733 --> 28:55.942
In the happy moments.

28:59.362 --> 29:00.196
Love.

29:02.574 --> 29:03.867
Our future.

29:07.996 --> 29:09.539
What did that look like?

29:12.125 --> 29:13.209
Children.

29:16.171 --> 29:17.672
He wanted many.

29:19.632 --> 29:21.384
And a son to be king.

29:29.267 --> 29:30.101
King?

29:35.815 --> 29:37.025
Revive her.

30:07.555 --> 30:09.265
You knew she was his daughter?

30:10.892 --> 30:13.478
Vitomir confided in me before we left.

30:15.688 --> 30:18.066
He was scared for her to travel as a girl.

30:21.277 --> 30:22.529
Now she has no choice.

30:37.293 --> 30:39.128
So, your name is Elena.

30:41.339 --> 30:42.173
Yes.

30:43.800 --> 30:45.844
I couldn't save your father and you.

30:50.890 --> 30:53.935
I promised him I would deliver
his treasure to Constantinople.

30:54.936 --> 30:57.021
I have moved his chest with my belongings.

30:58.064 --> 30:59.774
I will protect it with my life.

31:03.987 --> 31:04.988
Thank you.

31:44.611 --> 31:45.486
She is gone.

31:49.365 --> 31:50.867
And did you learn what you wanted?

31:52.994 --> 31:53.828
No.

31:58.082 --> 31:59.584
But I have no regrets.

32:00.168 --> 32:01.294
"No regrets."

32:03.004 --> 32:04.172
You are a murderer.

32:04.255 --> 32:06.257
-Silence.
-No.

32:06.341 --> 32:09.010
You have taken the one decent
thing from my life,

32:09.093 --> 32:10.178
when I gave you everything.

32:10.261 --> 32:11.387
-My loyalty…
-Silence!

32:11.471 --> 32:12.805
…my faithfulness.

32:12.889 --> 32:15.016
You took my wife!

32:17.602 --> 32:20.605
God may forgive you. But I never will.

32:45.546 --> 32:46.756
I'm sorry.

32:48.675 --> 32:49.968
I did not mean to interrupt.

32:50.051 --> 32:51.260
Please, princess.

32:52.553 --> 32:53.763
Go away.

32:58.184 --> 32:59.727
She wanted you to have this.

33:21.374 --> 33:23.167
-Were you close to her?
-Yes.

33:24.335 --> 33:26.212
I knew she was in love.

33:28.506 --> 33:30.133
But she never spoke of you by name.

33:30.216 --> 33:34.053
She would only tell me that she had never
been happier in her entire life.

33:43.730 --> 33:44.897
Princess Gytha.

33:48.443 --> 33:49.527
Thank you.

34:14.260 --> 34:16.220
What happened to the other ships?

34:16.304 --> 34:19.640
After we left here,
there was a great storm.

34:19.724 --> 34:22.185
It divided the fleet.

34:22.977 --> 34:24.437
We sailed for weeks

34:24.520 --> 34:29.442
without finding signs of Harekr
and the others. We fear they are lost.

34:39.494 --> 34:42.538
We should offer a sacrifice
for their safe return.

34:44.916 --> 34:46.959
Yes, we will do so.

35:01.516 --> 35:02.433
Friends.

35:03.518 --> 35:06.312
Before we beseech the gods for their help,

35:07.396 --> 35:09.232
let us remind them of our faith.

35:13.736 --> 35:17.281
The refugees built
this temple to the old gods.

35:18.491 --> 35:19.450
Freya.

35:20.034 --> 35:23.412
This time of year, we worship you
as the bringer of fertility.

35:25.414 --> 35:26.499
And Iduna.

35:28.167 --> 35:30.253
The goddess of the blossoms.

35:31.879 --> 35:33.131
How we have missed you.

35:34.549 --> 35:40.221
And Gefjon, goddess of the fields.
And Gná, the rider of winds.

35:41.931 --> 35:44.183
We promise to never again forget.

35:46.352 --> 35:49.105
And especially Njrd.

35:51.649 --> 35:53.276
God of the seas.

35:55.027 --> 35:59.740
Please guide Harekr
and our families back to us safely.

36:00.825 --> 36:02.618
Here are the builders of this temple.

36:03.661 --> 36:04.662
Come.

36:05.705 --> 36:07.623
Join us in our offering.

36:12.879 --> 36:13.754
Come.

36:15.673 --> 36:17.675
Let us all worship together.

36:20.428 --> 36:21.262
Hrefna.

36:28.728 --> 36:32.690
Believers in the same gods
cannot be two people.

36:34.108 --> 36:36.068
We are all the same in our hearts.

37:24.283 --> 37:25.159
Brother.

37:35.586 --> 37:39.674
Where is everyone?
Why aren't they here to greet us?

37:39.757 --> 37:40.883
They are in the forest.

37:41.676 --> 37:42.593
With Freydis.

37:43.803 --> 37:45.012
Forest?

37:45.096 --> 37:46.555
You must not be angry.

37:47.348 --> 37:49.308
The people were anxious for your safety.

37:49.976 --> 37:51.519
They turned to Freydis for guidance,

37:51.602 --> 37:53.771
she took them to the woods
where the refugees pray.

37:53.854 --> 37:55.481
They prayed for your return.

37:55.564 --> 37:57.441
Where is Jorundr?

38:41.444 --> 38:45.072
You… have betrayed me.

38:45.156 --> 38:47.825
-What are you talking about?
-I left you here in charge.

38:47.908 --> 38:50.244
-I come back to chaos.
-Chaos?

38:50.328 --> 38:53.122
You returned to peace.
Isn't that what you wanted?

38:53.873 --> 38:56.709
I don't want them worshiping
<i>with</i> our people.

38:56.792 --> 39:00.421
I want them working <i>for</i> our people.

39:00.504 --> 39:03.591
They are a filthy mix of Norse tribes.
Not like us.

39:04.842 --> 39:07.678
We are the superior people.

39:07.762 --> 39:09.764
What about Freydis? She's our priestess.

39:10.765 --> 39:13.976
She is only a priestess
because I made her one.

39:15.561 --> 39:17.146
What are you doing? No--

39:25.363 --> 39:26.781
What you should have done.

39:34.538 --> 39:35.873
It is beautiful.

39:44.423 --> 39:45.674
Run! Run!

40:06.946 --> 40:07.780
You…

40:08.364 --> 40:09.490
You are a murderer.

40:09.573 --> 40:12.493
You are no better than the Christians
they came here to escape.

40:12.576 --> 40:14.161
I brought them here.

40:16.580 --> 40:19.625
They live because
I grant them life. Not you.

40:20.459 --> 40:22.711
You have angered the gods!

40:22.795 --> 40:24.547
You have angered me!

40:27.299 --> 40:29.468
Take her to the temple. Lock her up.

40:30.928 --> 40:33.889
No! No!
