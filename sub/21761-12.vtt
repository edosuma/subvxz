Your Majesty, I have everything marked

00:44.503 --> 00:46.045
and ready for you to sign.

00:46.129 --> 00:48.757
-Your Majesty?
-Very busy right now, Maurice.

00:48.924 --> 00:52.260
Timo just hooked me up
with this magical device.

00:52.344 --> 00:54.513
Not only does it clean my floors,

00:54.596 --> 00:57.599
but the vibrations make my tushy tingle.

00:57.683 --> 00:58.559
[laughing]

00:59.685 --> 01:00.978
-[crashing]
-Oy...

01:01.687 --> 01:05.148
Oh, what is that attached
to my King Julien?

01:05.232 --> 01:06.734
It looks like so much fun.

01:06.901 --> 01:09.444
No, Mort. Bad, Mort. Heel!

01:11.488 --> 01:12.489
[grunting]

01:21.957 --> 01:22.791
[shouts]

01:22.875 --> 01:24.626
Yes, Maurice, you need something?

01:24.710 --> 01:26.754
A lot of important papers to sign here,

01:26.837 --> 01:29.757
not to mention a backlog
of other work that needs doing.

01:29.840 --> 01:33.052
Please, Maurice,
I don't think of what I do as work.

01:33.134 --> 01:37.305
I think of my life as a never-ending
beautification project.

01:37.848 --> 01:40.684
Eh, I'm going to need
my royal writing instruments.

01:40.768 --> 01:43.186
Mort, bring me my scrapbooking kit.

01:47.024 --> 01:48.859
[blows a raspberry] Gimme a break.

01:48.943 --> 01:52.947
Like burnt sienna is a color
anyone would ever use.

01:53.072 --> 01:54.073
[chuckles]

01:54.155 --> 01:54.990
Ow!

01:55.699 --> 01:56.742
But thank you.

01:56.909 --> 01:57.993
Now we can begin.

01:58.077 --> 02:02.039
[drawling] J...

02:02.247 --> 02:03.457
New color!

02:03.540 --> 02:06.251
[drawling] U...

02:06.501 --> 02:07.502
New color!

02:07.586 --> 02:10.672
[drawling] L...

02:15.176 --> 02:16.678
[straining]

02:17.512 --> 02:18.346
[grunts]

02:18.806 --> 02:22.017
All King Julien had to do
was sign a few papers.

02:22.225 --> 02:23.184
A few papers!

02:24.185 --> 02:25.687
And done.

02:27.606 --> 02:28.523
[humming]

02:31.234 --> 02:32.235
[laughing]

02:33.862 --> 02:34.696
Wha...

02:36.698 --> 02:37.574
[Mort grunting]

02:38.533 --> 02:41.745
Burnt sienna? You useless, hideous shade.

02:41.829 --> 02:45.082
Maurice, I want
all burnt sienna destroyed.

02:46.291 --> 02:47.668
-Mo-Mo?
-[Mort shouting]

02:47.751 --> 02:48.585
Ow!

02:49.086 --> 02:51.130
The question plaguing the kingdom is

02:51.212 --> 02:54.299
do I dot the "i" in Julien
with baby glitter hearts,

02:54.382 --> 02:55.801
or a smiley face?

02:55.968 --> 02:59.387
I'm afraid "glitter hearts"
and especially "smiley faces"

02:59.471 --> 03:02.181
are outside my area of expertise,
Your Majesty.

03:02.265 --> 03:03.767
[humming]

03:06.394 --> 03:09.439
Maurice, you're just in time.
Wait, where have you been?

03:09.606 --> 03:11.566
Nowhere. Just doing my thing.

03:11.650 --> 03:12.860
You know, hanging out.

03:12.943 --> 03:15.529
So stop hanging out and start hanging in.

03:15.612 --> 03:18.115
I need your advice. The royal signature?

03:18.615 --> 03:20.034
Go with the smiley face.

03:20.199 --> 03:22.786
Okay, baby glitter hearts it is.

03:22.911 --> 03:25.164
All righty. Whatever you want.

03:26.205 --> 03:28.458
I'm gonna hit my hut for a napparoony.

03:28.542 --> 03:29.584
Napparoony?

03:30.085 --> 03:32.211
How does he know about napparoonies?

03:32.295 --> 03:34.213
Where is he learning this stuff?

03:34.297 --> 03:37.801
And why is he so calm and relaxed?

03:37.885 --> 03:41.972
He did possess an uncharacteristic
degree of relaxedness.

03:42.056 --> 03:44.058
You know, this isn't the first time

03:44.141 --> 03:48.228
he's disappeared and come back
all happy and... "all righty."

03:49.897 --> 03:50.731
[sighs]

03:50.814 --> 03:54.693
Your Majesty, this mystery
calls for an investigation.

03:54.860 --> 03:56.153
Yes, it does.

03:56.319 --> 03:58.446
Yup, so I'm gonna go investigate.

03:58.530 --> 03:59.740
You do it.

04:02.576 --> 04:04.119
[hissing softly]

04:04.203 --> 04:06.705
Target: Maurice, the king's advisor.

04:06.788 --> 04:09.374
Uncharacteristic happiness,
cause for concern.

04:09.457 --> 04:11.919
Could be up to something
illegal and illicit.

04:12.002 --> 04:15.130
Terminate with extreme prejudice,
if necessary.

04:16.006 --> 04:17.382
Target acquired!

04:18.633 --> 04:19.509
[panting]

04:23.388 --> 04:24.223
[hissing]

04:25.682 --> 04:26.600
[hissing]

04:26.725 --> 04:27.642
[gasps]

04:29.603 --> 04:31.980
Target acting suspiciously.

04:32.064 --> 04:34.441
Probably means he's guilty of something.

04:34.524 --> 04:35.984
Prepare to take him out.

04:36.568 --> 04:37.444
[hissing]

04:39.905 --> 04:41.322
Oh, no! [gasps]

04:41.406 --> 04:43.784
Maurice, how could you?

04:44.367 --> 04:45.202
[hissing]

04:48.371 --> 04:49.330
Mission accomplished!

04:49.497 --> 04:53.001
Oh! Clover!
Stop sneaking up on me like that!

04:53.085 --> 04:54.878
You know you can just use the door

04:54.962 --> 04:56.463
like a normal crazy person.

04:56.546 --> 04:57.589
It's just...

04:57.672 --> 04:59.758
What's the word I'm looking for, Mort?

05:00.008 --> 05:02.010
Freaky-deaky? [chuckling]

05:02.177 --> 05:04.012
Exactly. It's freaky-deaky!

05:04.471 --> 05:08.142
I know where Maurice goes to "get happy."

05:08.308 --> 05:09.726
Tell me, tell me.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.979
I just gotta know! I just gotta!

05:12.062 --> 05:15.356
I must warn you,
you are not gonna like it.

05:18.610 --> 05:21.613
You see, King Joey,
if we put the aqueduct here,

05:21.696 --> 05:23.157
we should be able to pipe water

05:23.240 --> 05:25.408
into the middle of the cheese fields here.

05:25.492 --> 05:27.202
That's just great!

05:27.368 --> 05:30.247
And thens we build the maze, right?

05:30.330 --> 05:33.583
Big, gigantic maze
with lots of dead ends, right?

05:33.959 --> 05:36.962
Er, no, Your Rat Majesty.
We're not building a maze.

05:37.045 --> 05:38.255
No more mazes.

05:38.421 --> 05:41.466
Right. Stupid, stupid! Idiot.

05:41.591 --> 05:42.717
[grunting in pain]

05:48.640 --> 05:50.475
Okay, there, Mr. Maurice.

05:50.558 --> 05:53.228
You the smart one. You knows best.

05:53.312 --> 05:54.729
No more mazes.

05:54.813 --> 05:56.690
Maurice, how dare you?!

05:56.857 --> 05:59.442
King Julien?
This isn't what it looks like.

05:59.609 --> 06:02.904
Oh, really? It looks like
you're giving advice to another king!

06:03.071 --> 06:05.657
Oh, well, then, it's exactly
what it looks like.

06:05.740 --> 06:06.867
But I can explain.

06:06.950 --> 06:09.494
King Julien doesn't want
to listen to a traitor!

06:09.577 --> 06:12.455
Clover, the kingly mouth
would like to speak for itself.

06:13.207 --> 06:16.918
I, King Julien, don't want
to listen to a traitor!

06:17.627 --> 06:21.006
But I'm going to because this
has really got me confused, man.

06:21.173 --> 06:23.050
Remember you blew up the coffee fields

06:23.133 --> 06:25.426
to save our kingdom from Karl
and caffeine?

06:25.593 --> 06:26.553
I don't give a rat's...

06:26.636 --> 06:28.555
Wait, Karl? Do I know a Karl?

06:28.763 --> 06:30.849
It sounds like an interesting name.

06:31.099 --> 06:33.018
Is that Karl with a "C" or a "K"?

06:33.101 --> 06:34.186
No, Your Majesty.

06:34.269 --> 06:37.356
Remember the Karl
that's always trying to kill you?

06:37.480 --> 06:38.899
You mean, Uncle King Julien?

06:38.982 --> 06:41.526
No. But yeah, him, too.

06:41.609 --> 06:45.488
Karl, always trying to, like,
finish you off with crazy plans.

06:45.655 --> 06:47.741
-Ha. Crimson?
-No.

06:47.824 --> 06:50.952
Well, yeah, I mean her as well, but Karl.

06:51.036 --> 06:52.037
Remember Karl?

06:52.120 --> 06:53.830
Skinny Carmine? The Yamburglar?

06:54.164 --> 06:55.456
Bert? Patrice?

06:55.623 --> 06:58.085
Scoop? Kendrick? Todd?

06:58.459 --> 07:00.670
Long story short,
without Karl's evil guidance

07:00.754 --> 07:03.798
and the coffee fields burnt,
the rats were living in chaos.

07:03.882 --> 07:05.633
They tried to set up their kingdom.

07:05.717 --> 07:08.053
The only thing
they were good at was mazes.

07:08.136 --> 07:10.597
And they really weren't good
at those either.

07:10.680 --> 07:13.474
When I found 'em, they were confused,
trapped in a maze

07:13.558 --> 07:14.684
and practically starving.

07:14.893 --> 07:17.229
[male rat] Guys! Over here!
I can smell it!

07:25.028 --> 07:27.155
So I helped them set up a working kingdom.

07:27.239 --> 07:30.825
Joey here became
the first of the rat kings, King Joey.

07:30.909 --> 07:34.746
Welcome to my kingdom, AKA area.

07:34.829 --> 07:36.373
By listening to my advice,

07:36.456 --> 07:38.750
everything runs smoothly
and everyone's happy.

07:38.833 --> 07:40.210
We sure are.

07:40.377 --> 07:42.670
We know where all the food is now.

07:42.754 --> 07:45.424
-Where is it again, Mr. Maurice?
-The cabinet.

07:45.673 --> 07:48.843
Oh, okay. The food's the cabinet.

07:48.927 --> 07:50.553
Hey, let's have a snack, boys!

07:53.807 --> 07:54.891
[sighing in frustration]

07:55.475 --> 07:57.518
They take everything so literally.

07:57.602 --> 08:00.147
No, no, the food isn't the cabinet.

08:00.230 --> 08:02.065
The food is in the cabinet.

08:03.400 --> 08:06.820
Right. Stupid, stupid! Idiot.

08:07.237 --> 08:10.824
Thanks, Mr. Maurice.
You's the smart one, sure.

08:11.908 --> 08:14.161
You've gotta be careful
how you phrase things.

08:14.286 --> 08:15.620
[shouting] Hello!

08:15.703 --> 08:19.458
It is time for Maurice to come home, okay?

08:19.666 --> 08:22.710
They take things literally.
They aren't hard of hearing.

08:22.794 --> 08:25.297
They listen to me and respect my opinions.

08:25.380 --> 08:26.547
Unlike some people!

08:26.714 --> 08:29.468
Come on. I've respected you plenty.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.052
Name one time.

08:31.136 --> 08:32.512
Eh, I can name a bunch.

08:32.595 --> 08:36.308
Like how I respected your idea
to build a trampoline maternity ward.

08:36.391 --> 08:39.353
Boy, did those babies have fun!
And we found most of them.

08:39.519 --> 08:42.022
Again, that was your idea.

08:42.105 --> 08:44.691
I wanted to build a hospital
and an old folks home.

08:44.774 --> 08:47.152
But that's how we roll, Mo-Mo.

08:47.235 --> 08:51.990
You start with a flat, boring idea,
and I put my KJ stink on it.

08:52.073 --> 08:53.658
Now come on, let's go home.

08:53.741 --> 08:54.617
No.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.496
Fine. Stay. See if I care.

08:57.578 --> 08:59.873
You're not going to have
any fun without me.

09:00.040 --> 09:00.999
Fine by me.

09:01.082 --> 09:02.417
And if you're staying,

09:02.501 --> 09:05.253
I banish you from the lemur kingdom.

09:05.420 --> 09:07.381
You're out and you can't come back.

09:07.464 --> 09:10.217
You can't banish me because I quit.

09:10.300 --> 09:11.301
I banish myself.

09:11.468 --> 09:15.763
Oh! You can't banish yourself
because I just un-banished you.

09:15.930 --> 09:18.975
-Really?
-Yeah. So I can banish you again!

09:19.059 --> 09:22.270
You are banished!
I banish you times infinity.

09:22.354 --> 09:23.646
Done! KJ out.

09:26.024 --> 09:27.192
Oh, brother.

09:28.151 --> 09:30.737
[Mort] You never loved me!

09:30.820 --> 09:32.655
Don't you understand?

09:32.739 --> 09:36.784
I love you, I love you! I love you.

09:36.868 --> 09:37.911
[blows nose]

09:38.912 --> 09:41.789
More volume. I'm not a lip reader. Rewind!

09:42.623 --> 09:43.708
[babbling]

09:43.791 --> 09:48.088
Don't you understand? I love you!

09:48.171 --> 09:54.177
Zip it! Just zip it.
You had me at "I love you!"

09:55.136 --> 09:57.138
Uh, what's going on here?

09:57.222 --> 09:58.806
This is the part where they kiss.

09:58.890 --> 09:59.974
[exclaiming]

10:00.475 --> 10:01.684
He's right, Ted.

10:01.768 --> 10:04.020
Everyone knows, in any good rom-com,

10:04.104 --> 10:07.357
the two characters who seem so opposite
always end up together.

10:07.648 --> 10:09.276
Oh, like you and Maurice.

10:09.650 --> 10:12.446
[chuckling] No! That's just ridiculous.

10:13.405 --> 10:16.950
Can't a king watch a movie
that bears no resemblance to his own life

10:17.033 --> 10:19.160
without hurtful rumors and gossip?

10:19.578 --> 10:21.871
Ugh! I mean... Ugh!

10:22.205 --> 10:24.458
I expect better from you, Ted. Unpause!

10:25.584 --> 10:28.378
What are you gonna do? That's the formula.

10:28.462 --> 10:30.505
Now pucker up. [kissing]

10:34.759 --> 10:36.219
[sobbing]

10:37.804 --> 10:40.348
[sighs, then groans]

10:44.060 --> 10:46.104
I know what you're going to say, Amelia.

10:46.187 --> 10:47.688
I'm too good for Maurice.

10:47.772 --> 10:50.066
But how can I blame you for thinking that

10:50.150 --> 10:51.734
when you're totally right?

10:51.901 --> 10:52.735
Heh.

10:52.819 --> 10:54.988
Uh, Amelia,
at least you'll never leave me.

10:55.071 --> 10:58.450
You'll help me hold it all together.

10:58.533 --> 10:59.659
What's that?

10:59.742 --> 11:03.788
Yes? Yes, I know,
I need to get out there again.

11:03.871 --> 11:06.791
Let the people know King Julien
is back on the market.

11:08.418 --> 11:11.254
I'm just so afraid of being hurt.

11:11.505 --> 11:13.047
No, no, you're right.

11:13.131 --> 11:15.509
I've waited six hours, that's long enough.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.470
It's time I found a rebound advisor.

11:21.139 --> 11:24.142
Bring in the first candidate
to be my rebound advisor.

11:25.893 --> 11:27.228
Oh!

11:27.479 --> 11:28.729
Okay.

11:28.813 --> 11:32.651
"Jacque Jacque de Jacque Jacque."
Hmm... First question.

11:32.733 --> 11:34.194
Are you Mort in disguise?

11:34.361 --> 11:36.946
[speaking in French]  Sacre non! Non, non.

11:37.030 --> 11:37.989
Yes.

11:38.072 --> 11:42.577
I mean,  oui, oui.  [laughs]
I just said wee-wee.

11:42.661 --> 11:43.495
[chuckling]

11:44.037 --> 11:44.871
Next!

11:45.497 --> 11:49.000
Well, hello now,
hello there, I say, I say,

11:49.083 --> 11:53.296
I am the right honorable Chair Lemur
Table Jr. Esquire,

11:53.380 --> 11:56.757
I say, I wanna be your rebound advisor.

11:57.758 --> 11:58.717
I say...

11:58.801 --> 12:01.012
[Julien] Mort, out! Next!

12:01.095 --> 12:05.892
Get your hot, hot advice right here.

12:07.143 --> 12:08.478
[sizzling sound]

12:08.645 --> 12:12.106
[retches] That's too far, Mort.
Even for you.

12:12.190 --> 12:13.107
Out, out, out.

12:13.274 --> 12:15.985
Uh, yeah, sorry little fella.

12:16.152 --> 12:17.945
That even freaked me out a little.

12:18.029 --> 12:20.114
Is there anybody else out there?

12:20.198 --> 12:21.575
Anybody at all?

12:21.658 --> 12:23.784
I am here and ready to work!

12:24.118 --> 12:25.620
Way to be fooled, Clover.

12:25.704 --> 12:27.706
That's clearly Mort in a disguise.

12:27.788 --> 12:29.374
No, sir. It's Horst.

12:29.457 --> 12:30.375
It's a what?

12:30.458 --> 12:32.335
Kind of a loner. Fears change.

12:32.419 --> 12:35.589
Often seen holding a beverage.
You know, Horst?

12:35.672 --> 12:39.092
Sounds like a freak to me.
And this is a freak-free zone!

12:39.175 --> 12:40.759
Out. Out. Next!

12:40.843 --> 12:43.804
[sighing] Mort, stop
with the disguises already.

12:43.971 --> 12:44.931
Still not Mort.

12:45.014 --> 12:47.141
Well, how can I tell?
They all look the same.

12:47.225 --> 12:48.226
Is that Dorothy?

12:48.309 --> 12:49.768
No, that's a man, sir.

12:49.852 --> 12:54.315
Uh, I don't think it's your job
to put labels on lemurs, Clover.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.025
Sheesh! That's just so wrong.

12:56.234 --> 12:57.776
Okay, take your best shot,

12:57.860 --> 12:59.862
man-woman-lemur-person, whoever you are,

12:59.946 --> 13:02.365
what advice would you give the king?

13:02.781 --> 13:06.369
Um... we're all going to die.

13:07.203 --> 13:08.622
Ugh! I just... Ugh!

13:09.080 --> 13:10.039
Way to go, guys.

13:10.206 --> 13:12.459
With this last piece, we are done!

13:12.542 --> 13:14.294
You're doing a bang-up job.

13:16.504 --> 13:17.547
What are you doing?

13:17.714 --> 13:19.424
A bang-up job.

13:19.507 --> 13:20.717
That's what you said.

13:20.883 --> 13:23.511
No, it was just a figure of speech.

13:23.595 --> 13:25.513
Never mind, you're doing a great job.

13:25.597 --> 13:27.641
Let's put the pipe in and finish, okay?

13:27.806 --> 13:30.143
Then, we build the maze, right?

13:30.226 --> 13:32.853
We can make lots of them really high walls

13:32.937 --> 13:35.148
and we can hide some food
in the end of it.

13:35.231 --> 13:36.983
But we won't know where it is.

13:37.066 --> 13:38.401
Oh, that'd be fun.

13:38.485 --> 13:42.322
Yeah, where is the food? I'm starving.

13:43.323 --> 13:44.407
[sighing]

13:49.412 --> 13:50.413
Ha!

13:50.497 --> 13:53.291
Clover, I've been looking
all over for you.

13:53.374 --> 13:54.751
I have a confession to make.

13:54.833 --> 13:57.337
And I know this comes as a huge surprise,

13:57.504 --> 13:59.838
but... I'm worried about Maurice.

14:00.006 --> 14:01.174
Good, finally.

14:01.257 --> 14:02.883
Very adult of you, Your Majesty.

14:02.967 --> 14:06.053
Now, can we just go over there
and tell him how you feel?

14:06.137 --> 14:08.306
Uh, that's a terrible idea, Clover.

14:08.389 --> 14:11.892
If I tell him how I feel,
then he'll know how I feel.

14:11.976 --> 14:14.979
Why on earth did I hire you
as my royal advisor?

14:15.062 --> 14:17.649
You didn't, you hired me
as your head of security.

14:17.732 --> 14:20.067
Oh, good, 'cause you stink at advising.

14:20.777 --> 14:23.988
I have a brilliant plan
that will make Maurice happy.

14:24.071 --> 14:28.493
I will sneak over to that rat kingdom
and spy on him.

14:28.576 --> 14:30.161
Watch him secretly.

14:30.244 --> 14:31.663
He won't even know I'm there.

14:31.830 --> 14:34.165
That's called stalking, Your Majesty.

14:34.248 --> 14:37.918
Ooh... Stalking! Sounds exciting.

14:38.044 --> 14:40.254
Who wouldn't love to be stalked?

14:40.338 --> 14:43.383
It's a way to flatter someone
without them knowing it.

14:43.466 --> 14:46.010
Um, that's not totally how the...

14:46.093 --> 14:49.055
That's actually the opposite
of what stalking is.

14:49.138 --> 14:52.016
Come, Clover, there's
a former advisor out there

14:52.099 --> 14:55.645
who has no idea how secretly flattered
he's about to get.

14:55.729 --> 14:58.565
Again, that's-- That's not quite
how it works. [exclaims]

15:00.400 --> 15:01.317
[exclaims in disgust]

15:01.401 --> 15:05.905
So, Your Rat Majesty,
have any ideas today?

15:06.280 --> 15:08.991
Thoughts? Crazy notions?

15:09.075 --> 15:10.660
Other than a maze.

15:10.744 --> 15:13.747
I did think about creating a maze.

15:14.414 --> 15:15.540
[groans]

15:15.623 --> 15:18.418
I was talking more along
the lines of a crazy, fun,

15:18.501 --> 15:19.836
wild, outlandish scheme

15:19.919 --> 15:22.129
that has a high probability
of ending badly

15:22.213 --> 15:23.506
but actually turns out great

15:23.590 --> 15:25.341
and makes everybody laugh, you know?

15:27.719 --> 15:31.806
The way you put words together
confuses me. [exclaims]

15:32.348 --> 15:33.641
Never mind. [sighing]

15:33.808 --> 15:36.477
King Julien may never
have listened to my ideas,

15:36.561 --> 15:39.105
but you know, never a dull moment.

15:39.188 --> 15:40.147
[grunts]

15:40.231 --> 15:41.190
Oh!

15:41.274 --> 15:44.944
Hello, Maurice. Do you dine here often?

15:45.027 --> 15:46.987
King Julien! Are you stalking me?

15:47.071 --> 15:48.865
Yes, are you flattered?

15:48.948 --> 15:50.366
Ow!

15:50.491 --> 15:53.035
This is not what it looks like, at all.

15:53.119 --> 15:54.203
Okay, yes it is.

15:54.370 --> 15:56.873
Is anybody else up there
waiting to embarrass me?

15:56.956 --> 16:00.084
What? Hey! What's going on?

16:00.668 --> 16:02.420
You brought the entire kingdom?

16:02.503 --> 16:03.797
Of course not.

16:03.880 --> 16:04.923
Someone had to stay behind

16:05.005 --> 16:06.925
to make sure
the kingdom would run smoothly.

16:08.008 --> 16:08.968
[shouting]

16:09.051 --> 16:09.886
[thuds]

16:09.969 --> 16:11.554
[shouting]

16:12.430 --> 16:13.264
[farts]

16:14.014 --> 16:16.976
King Julien, I've told you.
It's over between us.

16:17.059 --> 16:18.561
You have to let me go.

16:18.645 --> 16:19.646
Never!

16:19.729 --> 16:22.607
No matter where you go, I will find you!

16:22.690 --> 16:25.443
I'll be right there, stalking you!

16:26.527 --> 16:28.112
Now you're just being pathetic.

16:28.279 --> 16:29.280
Go away! Go!

16:29.363 --> 16:30.907
I just wish you'd disappear.

16:31.365 --> 16:32.241
[both] Hmm.

16:32.325 --> 16:35.035
I'm not pathetic. You are.

16:35.202 --> 16:39.290
I just came by to tell you how happy I am
that you're not around anymore.

16:39.373 --> 16:42.543
I'm like super happy now
and I laugh all the time.

16:42.627 --> 16:44.462
[laughing remorsefully]

16:44.545 --> 16:46.046
See? So there!

16:46.130 --> 16:49.717
Bye forevs! Come on, Clover and kingdom.

16:49.801 --> 16:51.636
We're outie 5000.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.805
If Your Majesty could just slow down?

16:56.766 --> 16:57.600
[sobbing]

16:57.684 --> 17:01.395
Like he's fading right before my eyes.

17:01.479 --> 17:05.149
Why does life's sting
have to sting so much?

17:05.232 --> 17:07.777
A half-sting, like a hangnail sting,

17:07.861 --> 17:10.196
would that be so hard?

17:10.279 --> 17:12.991
[male voice]
If Maurice knew how you really felt...

17:13.073 --> 17:14.200
That voice.

17:14.283 --> 17:15.660
...I'm sure he'd come back.

17:15.743 --> 17:16.911
Is it possible?

17:17.077 --> 17:19.998
Yes Julien, it is I, Pineapple.

17:20.164 --> 17:23.001
What are you doing here?
I thought you lived...

17:23.083 --> 17:24.293
[whispering] upstairs.

17:24.460 --> 17:28.715
I came because I hate to see
true friendship die.

17:28.798 --> 17:31.467
And because I got into debt
with some bigger fruits

17:31.551 --> 17:35.596
and they're making me
help you to pay down the vig.

17:35.763 --> 17:38.516
I'm afraid you're too late, Pineapple.

17:38.599 --> 17:40.935
Maurice wants nothing to do with me.

17:41.019 --> 17:43.021
Well, have you told him how you feel?

17:43.103 --> 17:46.106
I don't know how.
Could I tell him psychically?

17:46.190 --> 17:48.150
That way my mouth wouldn't have to move.

17:48.234 --> 17:51.320
Perhaps you can tell him
in a different way.

17:51.404 --> 17:53.239
Oh... puppets!

17:53.322 --> 17:57.035
I was thinking more along
the lines of a song.

19:54.110 --> 19:56.737
Although I still think
puppets could work--

19:56.821 --> 19:59.532
No, no, you're right, Pineapple.

19:59.615 --> 20:01.742
I know exactly what to do.

20:01.909 --> 20:04.620
I'll just march right over
to that rat kingdom

20:04.704 --> 20:06.497
and tell Mo-Mo the truth.

20:06.580 --> 20:08.875
That I'm sorry and I miss him.

20:08.958 --> 20:13.379
I'll say "Maurice, you complete me,"
and "I'll have what he's having,"

20:13.462 --> 20:16.841
and "You make me want to be
a better king" and "Ditto."

20:16.924 --> 20:18.926
And I'll say that I'm just a king

20:19.010 --> 20:22.763
standing in front of an advisor
asking him to come back.

20:22.847 --> 20:24.306
[laughing] Yes!

20:25.516 --> 20:27.560
Maurice! You must have heard me already!

20:27.643 --> 20:28.561
You came back!

20:28.644 --> 20:29.562
Wait, you're not--

20:29.812 --> 20:30.688
[screaming]

20:31.689 --> 20:33.357
What's wrong, Maurice?

20:33.440 --> 20:35.193
You look like a cheese-filled trap

20:35.275 --> 20:37.236
just split your mother in half.

20:37.319 --> 20:40.907
Hey, King Joey. I'm okay. It's just...

20:41.448 --> 20:43.701
Seeing King Julien yesterday
made me realize

20:43.784 --> 20:47.329
I really do miss him,
despite how much trouble he is.

20:47.413 --> 20:50.083
-I'm going back to him.
-Good news! Ha!

20:50.166 --> 20:52.960
You don't have to go back now
'cause he's dead.

20:53.127 --> 20:54.253
[laughing]

20:55.046 --> 20:57.215
-What?
-We killed him.

Let's make a maze to celebrate!

20:59.675 --> 21:01.052
Killed him? Why?

21:01.135 --> 21:03.470
Because you wanted him disappeared.

21:03.554 --> 21:05.514
You said so. I was listening.

21:05.681 --> 21:07.100
That is not what I wanted.

21:07.183 --> 21:08.851
It's a figure of sp-- Never mind.

21:08.935 --> 21:10.352
You have to stop this.

21:10.436 --> 21:11.353
That's what I want.

21:11.437 --> 21:13.773
Stop King Julien from being "disappeared."

21:13.856 --> 21:16.483
Stupid, stupid! Idiot.

21:16.567 --> 21:18.694
Sorry about that, Mr. Maurice.

21:18.778 --> 21:23.157
Maybe we can still stop it.
I put Lazy Doug on the job.

21:23.241 --> 21:24.992
There he is. Hey, Dougie.

21:25.076 --> 21:27.745
You do that thing with the thing
with King Julien?

21:27.828 --> 21:33.167
I overslept so I got
Efficient Charlie to do it.

21:33.251 --> 21:34.877
Oh, that's bad luck.

21:35.044 --> 21:37.713
Efficient Charlie always gets it done.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.715
He's real efficient-like.

21:39.882 --> 21:42.135
I gotta save King Julien!
Tell me where he is!

21:43.302 --> 21:47.014
Hey, listen, boss says disappear ya,
I disappear ya.

21:47.098 --> 21:48.348
Hope you understand.

21:48.515 --> 21:50.684
[muffled] No. No, I don't understand.

21:50.851 --> 21:52.686
Well, what I'm going to do is,

21:52.770 --> 21:55.231
I got no time to explain again.

21:55.273 --> 21:56.149
[screaming]

21:56.315 --> 21:58.609
I'll save you, Your Majesty!

21:59.777 --> 22:01.946
King Julien!

22:03.864 --> 22:05.116
Uh-oh.

22:08.744 --> 22:10.871
I accept your apology for leaving me.

22:11.038 --> 22:15.209
I didn't apologize, but...
I'd be happy to.

22:15.293 --> 22:17.044
King Julien, I just--

22:17.128 --> 22:18.337
[shushing]

22:18.420 --> 22:19.297
Don't speak.

22:19.755 --> 22:21.007
Bring it in, Mo-Mo.

22:21.090 --> 22:23.383
Thanks, King Julien.

22:23.467 --> 22:25.385
Okay, that's enough. Five second rule.

22:25.469 --> 22:26.762
Let's go home, buddy.

22:26.846 --> 22:28.722
Good idea. Kinda dull around here.

22:28.889 --> 22:31.225
But, at least I know
with such a great start,

22:31.309 --> 22:34.394
the rats of rat kingdom
will be just fine without me.

22:34.561 --> 22:37.106
-Hm.
