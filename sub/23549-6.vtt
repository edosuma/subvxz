WEBVTT

00:29.000 --> 00:31.400
[man] Lotus. Then quiet.

00:32.680 --> 00:35.680
Put your focus on the polarity of...

00:35.760 --> 00:36.960
[Master] Where are you?

00:37.040 --> 00:38.360
[gods grunting]

00:38.440 --> 00:39.440
I'm here.

00:40.920 --> 00:42.400
But I should be out there.

00:43.200 --> 00:45.760
[Master] You must master this
before you train with the others.

00:48.160 --> 00:49.520
What does it matter?

00:49.600 --> 00:52.120
I need to destroy demons,
not write them love letters.

00:52.800 --> 00:56.160
Which is why you are the head
of the palace guard.

00:58.160 --> 01:01.160
But you need to learn
the ancient language.

01:02.520 --> 01:05.840
It is a privilege given only to the gods.

01:05.920 --> 01:07.200
I know the human language.

01:08.240 --> 01:10.480
I'll never need this.
Never have, never will.

01:12.600 --> 01:14.200
You are unique, Monkey.

01:15.400 --> 01:17.360
That is why we brought to you
to the academy.

01:18.080 --> 01:19.560
We must take our time.

01:21.120 --> 01:23.800
-We do not yet--
-Understand my potential.

01:33.400 --> 01:36.680
Master, why do you keep this
if no one ever wears it?

01:49.160 --> 01:52.240
A memory of the days
before gods understood...

01:53.040 --> 01:55.160
that we do not need a king.

01:58.800 --> 02:01.120
[Tripitaka] Monkey? Monkey!

02:01.200 --> 02:03.720
[breathing heavily] Wake up.

02:05.760 --> 02:06.760
Help him!

02:08.120 --> 02:10.280
[shaman] I warned him not to go so deep.

02:11.160 --> 02:12.920
They will never get him back.

02:14.040 --> 02:17.520
[Tripitaka] Monkey, please... Wake up!

02:38.240 --> 02:39.280
Late.

02:40.040 --> 02:42.120
Couldn't get your hair right? [scoffs]

02:42.200 --> 02:44.080
You're not exactly run off your feet.

02:44.960 --> 02:46.080
What's the rush?

02:46.160 --> 02:47.760
[people applauding]

02:49.040 --> 02:50.040
[Lior] Hear that?

02:50.840 --> 02:53.480
The Master's teaching
his signature combination tonight.

02:54.600 --> 02:55.720
I've got my own tricks.

02:56.640 --> 02:58.040
[breathing heavily]

03:00.880 --> 03:02.480
Best be on your toes.

03:03.040 --> 03:04.080
It's out there.

03:05.040 --> 03:06.320
The demons are watching.

03:06.400 --> 03:08.640
They're gathering,
and they will come for us.

03:09.880 --> 03:11.560
Really beating a path to the gate.

03:12.720 --> 03:14.040
Hope I can handle it.

03:14.120 --> 03:15.400
[grunts]

03:16.440 --> 03:17.720
Just do your job.

03:23.400 --> 03:25.080
Thank you all for coming.

03:25.160 --> 03:27.640
I know. It's hard to believe
that there was a time

03:27.720 --> 03:29.880
when my greatness wasn't appreciated.

03:29.960 --> 03:31.000
[scoffs]

03:31.560 --> 03:38.120
A time when many didn't understand
the importance of hitting a rock...

03:39.760 --> 03:42.120
[grunts] with a stick.

03:49.440 --> 03:51.360
[cheering]

03:53.560 --> 03:55.560
[people applauding]

03:56.680 --> 04:01.840
[Master] The Tall Son.
The first of the Three Son combination.

04:10.320 --> 04:11.880
Now, something a little trickier.

04:12.680 --> 04:13.680
The Dizzy Son.

04:20.399 --> 04:21.480
The Angry Son.

04:29.120 --> 04:31.160
And now, begin.

04:33.600 --> 04:34.800
[gods grunting]

04:35.640 --> 04:38.600
[Master] Keep your balance.
Find your form.

04:39.600 --> 04:40.600
And again.

04:41.880 --> 04:43.720
Channel your power.

04:45.160 --> 04:46.560
[gods continue grunting]

04:52.640 --> 04:53.640
[people screaming]

04:54.280 --> 04:55.280
[grunts]

04:59.000 --> 05:00.200
The Tall Son.

05:03.240 --> 05:04.200
[growls]

05:04.800 --> 05:05.720
The Dizzy Son.

05:07.840 --> 05:09.440
[groans]

05:10.800 --> 05:12.120
[grunting]

05:14.560 --> 05:15.560
The Angry Son!

05:15.640 --> 05:17.200
[both grunting]

05:21.280 --> 05:22.400
[panting]

05:22.480 --> 05:25.040
I like to call this one "the Heavy Son."

05:27.920 --> 05:29.480
[screams]

05:35.680 --> 05:37.280
[sighs and chuckles]

05:37.920 --> 05:39.640
A little twist on an old favorite.

05:41.160 --> 05:43.520
I think we can all agree it was perfect.

05:44.200 --> 05:46.320
[chuckles] Yeah.

05:47.400 --> 05:49.080
Grateful lot, aren't you?

05:49.160 --> 05:51.200
How did the demon get through the gate?

05:53.760 --> 05:56.400
We will speak about this at the assembly.

05:58.040 --> 05:59.200
You are dismissed.

06:07.360 --> 06:09.360
[indistinct chatter]

06:20.680 --> 06:24.040
[Davari groaning] You got me in the eye.

06:24.120 --> 06:25.240
[Monkey] Come on, Davari,
you can't fool me.

06:25.320 --> 06:27.080
Oh, I'm serious, man.

06:27.160 --> 06:28.520
Whoa, I can see two of you.

06:28.600 --> 06:30.160
And you're both ugly.

06:30.240 --> 06:31.160
[grunting]

06:33.000 --> 06:35.240
Oh, come on. God versus human.

06:35.320 --> 06:37.680
-No, not now, Davari.
-What?

06:37.760 --> 06:40.480
-Not now.
-Yeah, trouble in Godland?

06:41.360 --> 06:43.560
What's wrong with a warrior
being a warrior?

06:43.640 --> 06:46.040
You know, you don't try
and turn it into something it's not.

06:46.680 --> 06:50.000
It's like you don't take a peach
and turn it into an apple.

06:52.960 --> 06:57.640
What if they want you to be both?
A peach and an apple?

06:57.720 --> 07:00.480
-A papple?
-You know what is both?

07:00.560 --> 07:01.640
A master.

07:02.280 --> 07:04.920
Yeah, a master is
a little bit of everything.

07:07.440 --> 07:08.440
Yeah.

07:10.680 --> 07:11.840
Hey. Hey, hey.

07:12.400 --> 07:15.040
You don't think they're training me
to become a master, do you?

07:15.920 --> 07:16.920
What else?

07:20.080 --> 07:21.080
Oh.

07:25.280 --> 07:29.400
You left your post,
inviting danger into the palace.

07:31.520 --> 07:35.680
This is the seat of the power of the gods,
home of the sacred scrolls.

07:36.400 --> 07:40.120
As head of the guard, it is
your responsibility to protect the palace.

07:40.200 --> 07:44.440
If you cannot accept that responsibility,
then perhaps you should be relieved of it.

07:45.160 --> 07:48.160
Now that you mention it,
I've been thinking.

07:49.160 --> 07:51.760
-I'd like to step down.
-Oh?

07:52.520 --> 07:55.960
And what role
would best suit your talents?

07:56.600 --> 07:57.720
You can speak freely.

07:58.560 --> 07:59.600
I think we both know.

08:00.960 --> 08:02.760
So, share it with us.

08:03.760 --> 08:06.440
The private lessons.
The talk of my potential.

08:06.520 --> 08:09.760
I am to be a master, and I accept.

08:11.640 --> 08:16.960
I am a little early, but that's the plan,
eventually, isn't it?

08:22.040 --> 08:23.040
Isn't it?

08:30.000 --> 08:31.120
[chuckles]

08:45.200 --> 08:50.000
A master must bring out the best
in those that they teach.

08:50.080 --> 08:53.080
If you can bring out
the flower bloom of this bud...

08:54.240 --> 08:55.840
then you will prove all you need.

08:58.800 --> 08:59.800
That's easy.

09:03.120 --> 09:04.120
[chuckles]

09:28.160 --> 09:29.360
[clears throat]

09:29.440 --> 09:30.840
The first time, a student.

09:31.400 --> 09:33.320
The second, a master.

09:48.440 --> 09:49.440
[chuckles]

09:51.160 --> 09:52.200
Of course.

09:52.800 --> 09:55.400
More force, more magic, more Monkey.

10:13.800 --> 10:15.320
[grunting]

10:20.360 --> 10:22.560
[panting]

10:27.120 --> 10:29.280
-[Monkey grunts]
-I have failed you.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.400
I did not give you
the guidance that you needed.

10:33.600 --> 10:34.600
Forgive me.

10:37.240 --> 10:39.000
Why are they trying to hold you back?

10:39.800 --> 10:43.280
The gods must be jealous of you
to be trying to control you like this.

10:43.360 --> 10:44.560
They can have all of it.

10:45.520 --> 10:46.600
I don't belong here.

10:47.240 --> 10:49.720
When I go home,
I'm gonna make my own kingdom.

10:52.480 --> 10:53.800
You're leaving Jade Mountain?

10:53.880 --> 10:56.320
Mmm-mmm. No, no, this is...
This is where you need to be.

10:56.400 --> 10:57.800
This is the center of the world.

10:57.880 --> 11:00.120
What's the point in coming here
if you leave with nothing?

11:00.200 --> 11:03.600
They belittle you. They look down on you.

11:03.680 --> 11:06.760
When if you wanted to,
you could destroy them all.

11:08.320 --> 11:11.200
You are a king.

11:12.320 --> 11:14.960
And you deserve a crown.

11:16.320 --> 11:18.360
You've been a good friend, Davari.

11:19.200 --> 11:20.240
The only one, really.

11:20.960 --> 11:22.320
[Tripitaka] Monkey, can you hear me?

11:22.400 --> 11:25.000
Come back, please.
We won't leave without you.

11:25.080 --> 11:27.720
[Pigsy] Oh, they've invited
their little friends.

11:28.560 --> 11:32.320
They're not little, especially that one.
He's massive.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.080
[growling]

11:35.040 --> 11:36.960
-[Sandy] What do you want?
-[Raxion] Hmm?

11:37.040 --> 11:40.480
[chuckling] We want you...
and we've got ya!

11:41.640 --> 11:43.120
I'm not sure what I should do.

11:43.200 --> 11:45.360
Well, think of something! Anything.

11:50.760 --> 11:54.440
[chanting] Na ninekah alookah
enumbah kudantai calaporeekah.

11:55.680 --> 11:56.920
[Davari] ...look down on you.

11:57.000 --> 12:00.880
When if you wanted to,
you could destroy them all.

12:02.080 --> 12:04.200
You are a king.

12:05.280 --> 12:07.400
[Tripitaka chanting] Na ninekah alookah
enumbah kudantai calaporeekah.

12:08.360 --> 12:11.480
Na ninekah alookah enumbah
kudantai calaporeekah.

12:12.360 --> 12:14.360
[Tripitaka chanting]

12:16.280 --> 12:18.680
-You've been a good friend, Davari.
-[Tripitaka] Monkey, we have to go!

12:18.760 --> 12:20.120
The only one, really.

12:22.960 --> 12:23.960
Monkey?

12:25.200 --> 12:26.280
Can you hear me?

12:28.680 --> 12:31.600
Monkey, you have to find your way back.

12:31.680 --> 12:35.920
Na ninekah alookah enumbah
kudantai calaporeekah.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.800
Na ninekah alookah enumbah...

12:37.880 --> 12:38.880
[gasps]

12:40.360 --> 12:43.240
[breathing heavily] Monkey? What was that?

12:43.320 --> 12:44.480
Was it real?

12:46.280 --> 12:49.280
Na ninekah alookah
enumbah kudantai calaporeekah.

12:49.360 --> 12:53.240
[echoing] Na ninekah alookah
enumbah kudantai calaporeekah.

12:53.320 --> 12:56.400
Na ninekah alookah
enumbah kudantai calaporeekah.

12:56.920 --> 13:00.080
Na ninekah alookah
enumbah kudantai calaporeekah.

13:01.080 --> 13:03.440
Na ninekah alookah
enumbah kudantai calaporeekah.

13:03.960 --> 13:06.920
Na ninekah alookah
enumbah kudantai calaporeekah.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.280
[Master] A crown does not make a king.

13:32.920 --> 13:34.400
I don't need your permission.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.880
You broke in here to steal the crown.

13:37.560 --> 13:38.560
That much is clear.

13:41.480 --> 13:45.040
Why did you bring me to join the gods?
You knew I would fail.

13:45.120 --> 13:48.440
We make mistakes, but we can mend them.

13:50.120 --> 13:51.640
Who said I wanna fix things?

13:52.200 --> 13:53.280
[Master] You're still here.

13:54.760 --> 13:56.320
-[blade stabs]
-[groans]

13:58.360 --> 13:59.720
[Monkey] Master?

14:11.520 --> 14:13.440
[both grunting]

14:28.240 --> 14:29.480
[panting]

14:32.440 --> 14:33.440
Master?

14:34.960 --> 14:37.200
-[groaning]
-Master.

14:38.200 --> 14:40.240
I'll stay, Master. I'll stay.

14:40.320 --> 14:43.280
You'll recover,
and everything will be as it was, okay?

14:43.960 --> 14:45.720
It's too late, Monkey.

14:46.720 --> 14:49.040
I have seen this day coming.

14:49.120 --> 14:52.400
The demons, they've tasted blood.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.400
[gasping] The sacred scrolls...

14:57.160 --> 14:58.880
they are coming for them.

15:00.560 --> 15:04.280
Take them and hide them well.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.200
Master? Master?

15:25.960 --> 15:27.360
Master! Master!

15:28.480 --> 15:29.560
What have you done?

15:30.240 --> 15:31.240
Murderer!

15:33.080 --> 15:34.600
He has the sacred scrolls.

15:34.680 --> 15:36.360
-[Tripitaka] He's innocent!
-[Lior] Stop him!

15:38.320 --> 15:40.000
-[guards clamoring]
-[whistles]

15:44.080 --> 15:45.680
[panting]

15:45.760 --> 15:49.000
You can't hide, traitor!
We will never stop looking.

16:06.240 --> 16:09.120
Na ninekah alookah
enumbah kudantai calaporeekah.

16:09.200 --> 16:10.200
[Monkey] Master.

16:13.680 --> 16:14.920
Forgive me.

16:17.000 --> 16:18.800
[breathing heavily]

16:20.160 --> 16:21.160
Tripitaka.

16:24.800 --> 16:25.840
I'm lost.

16:27.920 --> 16:28.920
Help me.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.080
Help...

16:31.000 --> 16:32.600
[shuddering]

16:32.680 --> 16:35.440
[Tripitaka] I will. I will.

16:37.360 --> 16:38.920
Na ninekah alookah...

16:39.960 --> 16:40.960
[gasps]

16:42.320 --> 16:43.320
[sniffs]

16:47.640 --> 16:50.240
-Tripitaka?
-You can see me?

16:51.280 --> 16:53.080
[blades clashing]

16:59.760 --> 17:01.240
[groans]

17:02.480 --> 17:03.520
Who are you?

17:05.640 --> 17:06.640
Tell me.

17:08.040 --> 17:10.359
The mask. You broke it.

17:10.440 --> 17:11.800
[sighs] Follow the demon.

17:11.880 --> 17:13.319
[guards clamoring]

17:14.760 --> 17:17.560
-[guard 1] Over here!
-[guard 2] Secure the chambers.

17:30.560 --> 17:31.560
Davari?

17:36.600 --> 17:38.400
No, it can't be. He's not a demon.

17:40.520 --> 17:42.080
[Monkey] As the Master wished,

17:42.920 --> 17:45.400
I scattered the scrolls
to the corners of our world.

17:46.960 --> 17:48.440
They chased me and found me.

17:49.280 --> 17:52.000
Hauled me back to face trial
for a crime I didn't commit.

17:56.480 --> 18:01.280
In the wild where you were found,
where the Master gave you kindness

18:01.360 --> 18:04.720
and mercy that you had not seen
and did not deserve...

18:05.560 --> 18:07.320
there you will be punished.

18:08.440 --> 18:11.440
As you took the life
and liberty of the Master,

18:11.520 --> 18:13.920
so shall your liberty be taken from you.

18:15.160 --> 18:18.240
Your prison will be one
not of quiet contemplation

18:18.320 --> 18:19.600
but of permanent exile.

18:20.560 --> 18:21.560
Nothing.

18:23.400 --> 18:24.600
I had to do nothing.

18:25.400 --> 18:27.600
For the flower to open,
all I needed was time.

18:28.920 --> 18:33.680
Your body will be frozen.
Your story will be forgotten.

18:34.680 --> 18:37.520
The world will consume you.

18:44.040 --> 18:46.560
This was never forged to damage gods.

18:49.760 --> 18:56.080
[chanting] Na ninekah alookah
enumbah kudantai calaporeekah.

18:56.160 --> 19:02.160
[gods chanting] Na ninekah alookah
enumbah kudantai calaporeekah.

19:02.920 --> 19:08.640
Na ninekah alookah
enumbah kudantai calaporeekah.

19:09.480 --> 19:14.720
Na ninekah alookah
enumbah kudantai calaporeekah.

19:15.520 --> 19:18.680
Na ninekah alookah enumbah kudantai...

19:18.760 --> 19:20.880
The demons! They're here.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.040
[clamoring]

19:23.000 --> 19:24.280
We're under attack.

19:31.800 --> 19:33.880
[gods yelling and screaming]

19:36.920 --> 19:38.520
[softly] ...kudantai calaporeekah.

19:38.600 --> 19:39.560
[gasps]

19:41.360 --> 19:44.600
-[breathing heavily] Did you see?
-The demons were waiting.

19:45.720 --> 19:47.400
The gods didn't have a chance.

19:48.880 --> 19:50.840
It was the beginning of dark times.

19:52.080 --> 19:55.120
Without you, the gods were weak.

19:56.320 --> 19:57.560
That was Davari's plan.

19:57.640 --> 19:59.160
-He used me.
-[Raxion] Problem?

20:00.520 --> 20:04.440
The monk, he just spoke
the ancient language.

20:04.520 --> 20:06.600
-[Sandy grunts]
-But the monk is human.

20:07.240 --> 20:11.800
And a human mind
is very, very easy to exploit.

20:12.560 --> 20:15.160
-Weapon up! You're going in!
-[all grunt]

20:15.240 --> 20:18.320
Uh, excuse me. Hey.

20:18.400 --> 20:20.280
I'm sure you're having profound feelings
at the moment,

20:20.360 --> 20:23.400
but we're about to be attacked
by some very angry-looking warriors.

20:23.480 --> 20:25.240
[all growling]

20:29.880 --> 20:33.320
Shaman, do some shaman magic on them.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.960
I was betrayed.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.600
The demon made a fool...

20:39.680 --> 20:41.800
-Destroy him!
-...of me!

20:43.120 --> 20:45.000
[warriors grunting]

20:45.080 --> 20:46.160
What's he doing?

20:46.240 --> 20:48.240
[warriors groaning]

20:49.880 --> 20:51.080
Are we winning?

20:51.720 --> 20:54.160
[warriors groaning]

20:54.240 --> 20:55.240
[gasps]

20:56.320 --> 20:58.120
[groaning continues]

20:58.200 --> 21:00.480
I... think not.

21:13.200 --> 21:14.440
Stop.

21:14.520 --> 21:17.640
Stop! You must not break the seal!

21:18.760 --> 21:23.360
You will contaminate the spaces
and destroy everything.

21:24.120 --> 21:25.120
[Monkey] Don't worry.

21:26.560 --> 21:29.080
You won't be around long enough to see it.

21:31.320 --> 21:33.040
[shaman] Then I'll kill us all,

21:33.120 --> 21:37.360
and we will all suffer the same fate,
Monkey King.

21:37.960 --> 21:41.160
-Oh, you wanna play catch?
-Monkey, no. I know what it does.

21:41.240 --> 21:43.520
It destroyed my home,
and it swallowed everything.

21:45.440 --> 21:47.320
[whirring]

21:48.360 --> 21:51.320
Monkey, please, trust me. We have to go.

21:54.760 --> 21:55.760
[Tripitaka] Monkey!

21:57.320 --> 22:00.520
Shaman, make your move, or we're cooked.

22:02.920 --> 22:06.160
[Tripitaka] Leave it, Monkey.
Fight him another day.

22:15.520 --> 22:16.520
[sighs]

22:33.160 --> 22:35.080
If we weren't already dead, we are now.

22:36.800 --> 22:38.480
We had the Monkey King,
and we let him escape.

22:38.560 --> 22:44.560
We have found something
far more valuable than broken gods.

22:45.720 --> 22:50.080
A human who knows
the language of the scrolls.

22:53.120 --> 22:54.960
The monk is the one we need.

23:02.000 --> 23:03.840
[theme music playing]
