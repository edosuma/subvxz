00:01.084 --> 00:03.382
<i>Previously on Hit the Floor:</i>

00:03.504 --> 00:05.381
- What is it you want?
- I want you.

00:05.506 --> 00:08.305
It's why I'm here,
it's why I'm dragging out the divorce.

00:08.467 --> 00:11.141
- Do you know who I'm the girlfriend of?
- Ex-girlfriend.

00:11.261 --> 00:12.934
You've zeroed in on someone new.

00:13.388 --> 00:15.857
- Keep it.
- It's gonna take longer

00:16.015 --> 00:18.565
- to pay off Benny's debt.
- Pick our next target then.

00:18.936 --> 00:20.654
We've been good
staying off the grid.

00:20.812 --> 00:23.941
I don't know if the Ahsha I met
months ago could've pulled this off.

00:24.107 --> 00:27.202
Doing something that'll get her fired,
something she's been able

00:27.361 --> 00:29.489
to keep hidden from me.
I'm working on it.

00:29.655 --> 00:32.659
<i>Derek Roman, TMZ. I got a shot
of you and your lady up the hill.</i>

00:32.783 --> 00:36.538
I didn't kill Olivia. I know he did it.
I knew he'd get away with it.

00:36.662 --> 00:38.585
- You're talking about Oscar.
- Yeah.

00:38.705 --> 00:41.709
There's a murderer inside
Devil's Arena. It's time to get out.

01:16.201 --> 01:19.171
Why are you so far away?

01:21.081 --> 01:24.210
A photographer got pictures of us
at the overlook last night.

01:24.376 --> 01:25.719
He sold them to TMZ.

01:25.877 --> 01:28.380
- Is this a joke?
- He hit me up for a quote.

01:28.547 --> 01:30.265
This isn't a joke.

01:30.382 --> 01:33.135
Look, I got them to hold off
till noon, but...

01:33.510 --> 01:35.979
I'm going to be kicked out
of the Devil Girls.

01:39.182 --> 01:40.525
What do we do?

01:40.684 --> 01:42.061
You told your agency about us?

01:42.227 --> 01:44.571
- We are way past that.
- When this goes public

01:44.730 --> 01:48.030
say you were comforting a friend
after the loss of her former boss.

01:48.191 --> 01:50.444
It got heated,
but it's not what it looks like.

01:50.611 --> 01:53.205
Just deny it. Deny it to everyone.

01:53.363 --> 01:54.831
Will that save Ahsha's job?

01:55.240 --> 01:56.662
Your guess is as good as mine.

02:04.374 --> 02:07.344
I don't wanna be guessing.
Make sure Ahsha stays a Devil Girl.

02:07.461 --> 02:10.180
Dancers aren't really my area
of expertise, Derek.

02:10.339 --> 02:12.717
- You can talk to your dad.
- You're overestimating

02:12.883 --> 02:15.978
the pull I have with Oscar.
He's in Tokyo. I wouldn't know how--

02:16.136 --> 02:17.433
Jude.

02:17.596 --> 02:21.521
Any time I've needed something,
you've come through for me.

02:21.767 --> 02:24.236
You need to come through for me
again.

02:37.491 --> 02:39.368
You didn't sell the restaurant.

02:40.369 --> 02:44.795
It was being undervalued. I'll try again
when the market heats up.

02:44.956 --> 02:47.175
This woman will not die.

02:49.711 --> 02:53.011
I have been cordially invited
to the reading of Olivia's will tonight.

02:53.340 --> 02:54.717
What would she leave you?

02:56.176 --> 02:59.396
A warehouse full of bandage dresses
and oestrogen patches?

02:59.763 --> 03:01.606
Not even a little respect
for the dead?

03:01.765 --> 03:06.066
That woman hassled me
till the day she died, literally.

03:08.814 --> 03:10.691
What are you talking about?

03:18.073 --> 03:20.075
I'm talking about blackmail.

03:20.826 --> 03:23.545
She sent me a letter,
demanded that I meet her

03:23.662 --> 03:27.383
and when I did, she went on and on
about some deranged plan

03:27.541 --> 03:30.340
to crash the groundbreaking
and cause trouble for Oscar.

03:30.460 --> 03:35.182
She said if I didn't back her up there,
she'd cause trouble for me.

03:35.340 --> 03:36.717
What kind of trouble?

03:36.883 --> 03:39.511
She knew about the oxymetholone.

03:40.178 --> 03:42.681
That you tested positive.

03:43.974 --> 03:46.523
That I gave it to you.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.105
How did she know about that?

03:49.271 --> 03:52.366
She was outside the locker room
that night.

03:52.524 --> 03:54.777
She overheard us.

03:57.279 --> 04:01.079
- Did she tell anyone else?
- I took care of it.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.077
Like I take care of everything.

04:10.542 --> 04:14.092
Okay, here are the rest of the outfits
for the Hollywood Arena promo shoot.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.221
Remind the girls, Oscar wants edge.

04:16.380 --> 04:19.055
New arena, new attitude.

04:23.013 --> 04:25.937
Michael, hi.
Thanks for calling me back.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.022
Listen,
I need you to do something for me.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.691
<i>- What do you need'?
- I've been trying to get a hold</i>

04:30.854 --> 04:32.401
<i>of Devil Girl personnel files.</i>

04:32.564 --> 04:36.114
<i>Human Resources told me
the police tagged them as evidence.</i>

04:36.276 --> 04:39.906
Can you call your friend in the L.A.P.D.
and get me a copy of Mia's file?

04:40.697 --> 04:41.994
Yeah, I-- I can try.

04:42.157 --> 04:43.830
Thanks.

04:47.454 --> 04:49.877
I heard this promo
is gonna run during primetime.

04:50.040 --> 04:51.713
After the kids have been put to bed.

04:51.875 --> 04:54.469
And right before Daddy
puts Mommy to bed.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.426
We're almost done. Five minutes.

04:56.546 --> 04:58.799
Ahsha? What is it?

05:00.383 --> 05:03.136
Dancers, take your places.

05:03.261 --> 05:07.391
Devil Girls promo, take one.
Playback.

06:49.409 --> 06:50.706
And cut!

06:59.502 --> 07:01.504
- Hello?
- You're supposed to be helping me

07:01.671 --> 07:04.595
with my charity event tonight.
This is not helping.

07:06.468 --> 07:07.890
Oscar! Oscar!

07:08.053 --> 07:09.930
What does Oscar
have you doing this time?

07:10.096 --> 07:11.643
Not Oscar, Derek.

07:13.224 --> 07:16.774
He got papped with one of the dancers.
He's got me calling all over Japan

07:16.937 --> 07:20.191
trying to track Oscar down
to beg him not to fire her.

07:20.857 --> 07:23.861
The dancer's your hubby's kid.
So thank him for me, would you?

07:23.985 --> 07:25.532
Ahsha?

07:27.030 --> 07:29.374
- Who took the picture?
- TMZ.

07:29.532 --> 07:32.502
Derek promised a quote
if they held it till noon,

07:32.661 --> 07:35.505
but he's not giving one,
just trying to buy some time.

07:39.918 --> 07:42.762
Give it to me like I like it, Reggie.

07:43.254 --> 07:46.474
Do I know you?
You look really familiar.

07:46.633 --> 07:49.853
I practically live at Devils Arena,
so unless you go to home games.

07:50.011 --> 07:52.184
Well, I'm a season ticket holder,
courtside.

07:52.347 --> 07:55.396
Louis Jason, investment banker.

07:55.558 --> 07:57.981
Kyle Hart, Devil Girl.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.780
I come here every morning.

08:00.939 --> 08:02.282
How crazy is that?

08:02.440 --> 08:05.410
We're both at every home game
and we meet at a coffee shop.

08:05.568 --> 08:08.117
Well, wherever it happened,
I'm just glad it happened.

08:08.279 --> 08:10.077
Unbelievable.

08:10.240 --> 08:13.369
I can't even go to the bathroom
without you hitting on someone.

08:13.535 --> 08:16.004
- No, Alisha, look-—
- Save it. You can have him.

08:16.329 --> 08:19.708
Hope you enjoy your trip
to Lake Flaccid. He can't get it up!

08:27.298 --> 08:29.847
- You got a second?
- I'm really busy right now.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.011
It's about Ahsha.

08:32.178 --> 08:33.804
She got herself into some trouble.

08:33.972 --> 08:36.066
What kind of trouble?

08:39.477 --> 08:41.855
TMZ has a picture of her
and one of your players.

08:42.647 --> 08:43.943
Derek.

08:44.107 --> 08:47.953
It's my understanding that something
like this can end a Devil Girl's career.

08:48.403 --> 08:49.871
I better get Oscar on the phone.

08:50.030 --> 08:52.783
Oscar is at the mercy of public opinion.

08:52.949 --> 08:54.701
Even if he wanted make an exception

08:54.868 --> 08:57.747
he can't if this thing doesn't spin
the right way.

08:58.121 --> 08:59.543
Ahsha needs to fix this.

08:59.789 --> 09:01.132
I can help her if you want.

09:02.625 --> 09:05.128
- How?
- By making it impossible for Oscar

09:05.295 --> 09:06.592
to fire her.

09:06.755 --> 09:08.678
People know Ahsha
through the all- stars,

09:08.840 --> 09:10.592
but she doesn't have a profile yet.

09:10.759 --> 09:12.853
Everything happening now
is gonna cement that.

09:13.011 --> 09:14.729
She can slum it in the gossip rags

09:14.888 --> 09:18.483
or we can lovingly present her to the
world through more mainstream media.

09:19.017 --> 09:21.270
We shouldn't be promoting this,
we should kill it.

09:21.436 --> 09:23.859
This story's gonna break
whether you like it or not.

09:24.481 --> 09:25.858
I know the head guy at TMZ.

09:25.982 --> 09:29.828
He agreed not to run the pic. Instead,
I've arranged for <i>Du</i> Monde Magazine

09:29.944 --> 09:32.788
to run with it on their website,
with a beautiful picture.

09:32.906 --> 09:35.910
It's gonna be shot by the photographer
who owns the original pic.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.919
Everyone?» haPPY-

09:40.413 --> 09:42.256
Pete, this is my business.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.088
I know what I'm talking about.

09:44.459 --> 09:47.429
My annual charity event is tonight
at the Pacific Design Center.

09:47.545 --> 09:50.640
The <i>Du</i> Monde piece will be timed
to Ahsha and Derek's arrival.

09:50.799 --> 09:53.598
- You want them there.
- It's a charity event.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.309
You want them there.
The Devils should be there as well.

09:56.471 --> 09:59.065
Dancers, players, everyone.
Should be a show of support.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.434
It wouldn't exactly hurt
your event either.

10:01.768 --> 10:05.363
Or you could roll the dice
on her career. Your call.

10:07.899 --> 10:09.697
Will it Work?

10:10.110 --> 10:12.283
Depends on one person.

10:13.196 --> 10:17.622
If this thing has a chance of working,
you need to go public in a big way.

10:17.742 --> 10:20.791
Not as just dating, but as a committed
boyfriend and girlfriend.

10:23.498 --> 10:25.466
Boyfriend and girlfriend.

10:27.418 --> 10:30.092
L-- Yeah, I guess so.

10:30.922 --> 10:34.301
I can put you in front of cameras
and reporters as Derek's' girlfriend,

10:34.425 --> 10:36.098
but I can't charm them for you.

10:36.261 --> 10:40.983
How well I do dictates whether or not
I get to keep my job as a Devil Girl.

10:41.307 --> 10:43.981
There's no guarantees,
but it's the best shot we got.

10:45.895 --> 10:47.568
I'm in.

10:48.273 --> 10:51.026
By the way, I don't think we've been
properly introduced.

10:51.192 --> 10:54.571
I'm Lionel. Your father's wife.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.666
TMZ.
I never saw you as the gossip type.

11:05.832 --> 11:08.210
Depends on the gossip.

11:09.669 --> 11:12.422
Guess who's being dragged
to Olivia's will reading tonight.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.349
Are you serious?

11:14.674 --> 11:17.848
She can't do anything gracefully,
why should die be any different?

11:18.011 --> 11:19.513
Something else is bothering you.

11:21.055 --> 11:22.898
Terrence?

11:23.474 --> 11:26.478
I can't believe I wasted so much time
with him.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.656
TW again.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.492
I miss him so much it hurts.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.499
Just tell him.

11:40.950 --> 11:43.749
You can't just walk up to someone
and tell them that.

11:43.912 --> 11:47.041
- Of course you can.
- I can't.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.463
I wouldn't even know how.

11:51.669 --> 11:54.388
Try. Fail.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.641
Try again. It's called being human.

11:57.800 --> 12:01.225
It's been pointed out to me
that that's not my strongest suit.

12:01.346 --> 12:03.974
- Jelena--
- I've got to go.

12:09.479 --> 12:12.232
- Zero, what's up?
- You got a minute to talk ball?

12:12.982 --> 12:14.325
Sure.

12:14.484 --> 12:17.363
When I played for Ohio, you know
what we knew about the Devils?

12:17.528 --> 12:21.158
That two seasons ago we owned you
and then you killed us in the playoffs.

12:21.324 --> 12:23.998
Devils run most of their plays
through Derek and Terrence.

12:24.160 --> 12:26.834
The year we beat you,
the year I got my ring,

12:26.996 --> 12:28.794
our defence adjusted,
and it worked.

12:29.165 --> 12:31.884
- Yeah, I remember.
- Now, playing for the Devils

12:32.043 --> 12:35.422
I see that approach,
it's wearing the whole team out.

12:38.967 --> 12:42.392
Here's some Ohio plays
that got us to the championship.

12:43.221 --> 12:44.848
I thought maybe we could use them.

12:46.015 --> 12:47.983
These plays,
you get the ball more.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.445
And Derek gets it less.

12:50.603 --> 12:53.356
Iron sharpens iron
as one man sharpens another.

12:53.523 --> 12:55.525
Proverbs, 27:17.

12:56.359 --> 12:58.032
We're all on the same team.

12:58.194 --> 13:01.664
Still, it's touchy, one player proposing
taking time away from another,

13:01.781 --> 13:04.705
which is why I came to you
instead of Coach D.

13:05.618 --> 13:08.588
I don't wanna be seen
as the new guy stirring things up.

13:09.455 --> 13:12.208
So you want the other new guy
to stir things up?

13:12.667 --> 13:14.010
Check out the plays.

13:14.168 --> 13:17.047
If I'm wrong,
this conversation never happened.

13:17.380 --> 13:21.886
If I'm right, this could make you.

13:27.598 --> 13:28.941
You went rogue?

13:29.100 --> 13:32.650
Longer it takes to pay of Benny's debt,
the longer I am stuck married to him.

13:32.812 --> 13:36.567
- I need to put some wind in our sails.
- By putting some wind in Louis'?

13:36.733 --> 13:40.408
Louis has a less- than- magic Johnson
and I have magical powers in that area.

13:40.570 --> 13:44.620
He's loaded.
When I get it up, he'll give it up.

13:45.408 --> 13:46.751
Wait, you're gonna wear that?

13:47.660 --> 13:49.628
We're 96 grand from the finish line.

13:49.787 --> 13:52.711
- I need to finish this.
- Two hundred grand.

13:52.874 --> 13:56.003
I found a broker this morning
that will take the ring.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.181
That's better.

14:13.978 --> 14:16.401
So I talked to my friend
at the L.A.P.D.

14:16.564 --> 14:18.612
There are no Devil Girl files
in evidence.

14:18.775 --> 14:20.402
How is that possible?

14:20.568 --> 14:22.912
- Time to give up, Sloane.
- I thought I told you--

14:23.071 --> 14:26.746
Not because it's dangerous. Because
it's one dead-end after the next.

14:27.283 --> 14:29.536
Sloane, Oscar is too good
at covering his tracks.

14:29.660 --> 14:32.254
- Michael, I told you, I'm--
- Hold on.

14:33.706 --> 14:36.380
- Yeah, I have to take this.
- You can talk in here.

14:48.513 --> 14:50.436
Hey. Come on in.

14:52.141 --> 14:53.893
So this is your office.

14:54.268 --> 14:57.442
- It's small.
- It's perfect.

15:01.526 --> 15:03.403
I wanted to be the first to tell you.

15:05.238 --> 15:06.740
Derek and I are together.

15:09.117 --> 15:11.495
Like "together" together?

15:11.661 --> 15:13.413
It's going to be in the press.

15:15.456 --> 15:19.051
You're gonna be in the press
as Derek Roman's girlfriend.

15:19.210 --> 15:22.259
Someone took photos of us,
I might get kicked off the team.

15:22.422 --> 15:27.303
Look, I-- I can't really hear
about your job right now.

15:27.468 --> 15:31.769
I didn't wanna tell you this,
but I had to, so...

15:34.183 --> 15:35.935
Ahsha.

15:40.648 --> 15:42.821
I keep getting your mail.

15:46.487 --> 15:48.330
It's time you change your address.

15:57.540 --> 15:59.508
Must get quiet here without Ahsha.

16:03.379 --> 16:04.676
Is that my phone?

16:04.839 --> 16:06.807
Someone's been sending you texts

16:06.966 --> 16:09.435
telling you to make me quit
over and over.

16:09.594 --> 16:13.315
Same number that called you earlier,
the call you had to take outside.

16:13.473 --> 16:16.727
For days, you've been pushing me
to stop investigating Oscar.

16:16.893 --> 16:19.897
- He got to you.
- No one got to me, Sloane.

16:20.021 --> 16:22.945
- The texts and calls are from my boss.
- Why would your boss

16:23.065 --> 16:26.239
- want me off this case?
- There is no case. Not anymore.

16:26.402 --> 16:27.995
It's a murder investigation now.

16:28.154 --> 16:32.204
It's too hot for the league to pursue.
Politically, think it's best we back off.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.160
I don't believe you.

16:35.912 --> 16:39.132
Did you even ask the L.A.P.D.
if they have those personnel files?

16:39.290 --> 16:40.712
I did, they don't have them.

16:40.875 --> 16:43.674
- HR said they did.
- Who does HR work for?

16:47.465 --> 16:49.968
I looked everywhere.

16:52.803 --> 16:54.680
Except

16:54.931 --> 16:57.025
Oscar's office.

16:57.141 --> 16:58.814
It doesn't matter. It's over.

17:00.811 --> 17:03.985
Just because the league got gutless
doesn't mean you have to.

17:04.106 --> 17:06.154
They reassigned me.

17:06.442 --> 17:09.366
I was supposed to be in Cleveland
last week.

17:19.247 --> 17:21.124
I'm sorry, Sloane.

17:21.290 --> 17:24.464
What you wanna do
is extraordinary

17:24.627 --> 17:26.003
and so is your anger

17:26.420 --> 17:28.639
at the organisation, at Oscar.

17:28.798 --> 17:31.642
You've been sitting on hurts
for 20 years.

17:31.801 --> 17:34.020
That can affect your judgment.

17:34.512 --> 17:36.935
This is too dangerous, Sloane.

17:37.932 --> 17:41.653
I need you to promise me you'll stop.

18:06.627 --> 18:08.379
After this, you have a dress fitting.

18:08.504 --> 18:10.802
Right.
Photo shoot, dress fitting, red carpet.

18:10.965 --> 18:13.514
And reporters are gonna be
grilling you about Dersha.

18:13.676 --> 18:16.020
- Dersha?
- It could be so much worse.

18:16.178 --> 18:17.771
Penel, Lionete.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.932
Pete and I were doomed
from the beginning.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.898
- What'll the reporters ask?
- Everything. Mostly asking you.

18:23.060 --> 18:24.812
- Have your answers ready.
- So hit me.

18:25.354 --> 18:26.981
How did you meet?

18:27.148 --> 18:29.526
When we first saw each other
or when we actually--?

18:29.692 --> 18:32.366
Spit out your answers.
Bumbling means you're lying.

18:32.528 --> 18:33.871
You met volunteering.

18:34.030 --> 18:35.953
- That's not true.
- They don't know that.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.789
- What's it like dating bad boy Derek?
- Come on.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.294
- We're ready.
- Come on.

18:40.453 --> 18:42.080
It's never boring.

18:42.246 --> 18:43.964
But that answer is.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.626
Bad boy Derek Roman, I wouldn't know.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.294
He's always been so sweet to me.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.884
I know a different Derek
than the rest of the world.

18:51.047 --> 18:52.515
He's my best friend.

18:52.673 --> 18:55.347
Am I Derek's girlfriend
or a Miss America contestant?

18:57.845 --> 18:59.597
Maybe you need a break.

18:59.764 --> 19:01.186
I need to stay a Devil Girl.

19:01.349 --> 19:02.692
Ask me another question.

19:11.734 --> 19:14.157
<i>- HEY-
- HEY-</i>

19:14.945 --> 19:18.916
I don't wanna bother you, but part
of this whole Ahsha and Derek thing

19:19.075 --> 19:21.498
is showing support
at the charity event tonight.

19:21.661 --> 19:25.086
The players are coming. Hopefully
get the world out to the dancers too.

19:25.247 --> 19:26.715
What Ahsha- Derek thing?

19:28.000 --> 19:30.048
I assumed she told you.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.639
They were caught together.

19:34.590 --> 19:37.013
Obviously, that can mean
Ahsha's spot on the team

19:37.176 --> 19:39.395
so they're trying
to get ahead of the story

19:39.553 --> 19:41.806
spin it so that Oscar will keep her.

19:41.972 --> 19:43.315
When did this happen?

19:43.474 --> 19:46.068
This morning.
The spin, that was Lionel's idea.

19:46.477 --> 19:49.902
- Lionel.
- She's spearheading the whole thing.

19:50.022 --> 19:52.024
She's very good at it, it's her thing.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.865
Well, I'm glad it's her thing,
but this is my job.

19:54.985 --> 19:57.659
Ahsha's not only my daughter,
she's my dancer.

20:00.282 --> 20:03.661
E- mail me whatever it is they're doing
and when and where this party is.

20:03.786 --> 20:05.663
- I'll have the dancers there.
- Sloane--

20:05.830 --> 20:09.130
Longer you're standing here,
the less time I have to get the word out.

20:15.172 --> 20:19.473
L-- I appreciate what you're trying to do,
but I am a lost cause.

20:19.635 --> 20:20.978
Nonsense, honey.

20:21.137 --> 20:24.482
- There's no such thing.
- I've tried every pill,

20:24.640 --> 20:27.439
I've been to sex therapists
on three different continents.

20:27.601 --> 20:29.524
Well, you've never been to me.

20:29.687 --> 20:31.530
When I'm done
assaulting your senses

20:31.814 --> 20:34.067
you'll need a chair and a whip
to keep it down.

20:34.358 --> 20:36.486
What, so--?
So you're trained at this?

20:39.739 --> 20:41.707
Just call it life.

20:43.576 --> 20:46.045
- Oh, speaking of.
- Yeah.

20:46.203 --> 20:48.672
Let's start with sight.

20:57.882 --> 20:59.680
How am I looking?

21:00.301 --> 21:01.644
- Speechless.

21:01.802 --> 21:03.179
- Yeah.
- That's a good start.

21:03.304 --> 21:05.056
Okay. Okay, okay, Okay-

21:05.181 --> 21:06.808
Yeah, that's...

21:08.517 --> 21:12.021
- On to hearing.
- Yeah.

21:12.146 --> 21:14.569
Yeah. That's good.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.238
<i>Oh, my"</i>

21:20.613 --> 21:22.661
Oh, my God.

21:24.074 --> 21:25.792
Your hair, your hair, your hair.

21:25.951 --> 21:28.374
Your hair, it's so nice.

21:28.621 --> 21:29.998
- That smell.
- Yeah?

21:30.164 --> 21:32.132
- You like?
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah.

21:33.250 --> 21:35.628
You know, I think--
I think I'm starting to.

21:39.465 --> 21:42.389
- Time for taste.
- Okay, okay.

21:46.388 --> 21:49.107
They're edible. Wanna nibble?

21:52.478 --> 21:55.903
Nothing? Get on all fours.

21:57.149 --> 21:58.776
Time for touch.

22:02.696 --> 22:04.323
Son of a--

22:05.241 --> 22:06.618
No.

22:06.742 --> 22:08.665
Wait, wait.

22:16.001 --> 22:17.503
Raquel.

22:19.547 --> 22:22.551
Listen. Lionel's hosting
a charity event tonight.

22:22.716 --> 22:26.596
The Devils will be there.
You should go with me.

22:27.221 --> 22:30.225
- I am going. With Pete.
- You're still with that guy?

22:30.891 --> 22:34.065
That guy? Just because
you had a run-in with him doesn't--

22:34.228 --> 22:36.697
I'm not thinking about me.
I'm thinking about you.

22:37.147 --> 22:38.694
Me?

22:40.067 --> 22:43.037
- I shouldn't say.
- Say it.

22:43.195 --> 22:45.197
No, I just--

22:46.156 --> 22:48.705
When we had our run-in

22:48.826 --> 22:51.045
I saw the look in his eye
when he punched me.

22:51.203 --> 22:53.501
Right after I brought up Sloane.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.501
It seemed
like he was still hung up on her.

23:08.512 --> 23:10.981
- I almost had him.
- Well, this is what happens

23:11.140 --> 23:13.108
when you do something without me.

23:13.726 --> 23:16.275
Keri Horran.
She looks like a decent target.

23:19.690 --> 23:23.365
- You set off that alarm.
- Why would I do that?

23:24.987 --> 23:26.785
This is Benny all over again.

23:26.947 --> 23:28.824
You're comparing me to Benny?

23:28.991 --> 23:32.336
How is this different? You've been
forcing me to collect with you

23:32.494 --> 23:35.213
from the beginning.
I can't even leave the house alone.

23:35.372 --> 23:38.421
Went from one case to another.
That's all guys ever do.

23:38.542 --> 23:42.137
No, it's because you think all guys
are Benny that he still has his debt.

23:42.504 --> 23:45.383
You've been fighting me
this whole time.

23:49.053 --> 23:51.147
I'm not wasting time
fishing for a new target.

23:51.263 --> 23:53.231
I'm closing this deal with Louis.

23:59.688 --> 24:01.907
And I know
just where I'm gonna close it.

24:02.107 --> 24:03.780
Drive.

24:11.241 --> 24:12.914
Over here.

24:13.077 --> 24:15.330
Miss Howard. Look out here.

24:18.666 --> 24:20.134
This is the moment.

24:20.542 --> 24:24.263
Photographs can be touched up,
articles can be edited. This is live.

24:24.421 --> 24:27.049
Cameras'll be in your face,
people will scream your name.

24:27.216 --> 24:29.514
You cannot just show up.

24:29.802 --> 24:31.395
You have to shine.

24:34.640 --> 24:36.187
Ready?

24:38.102 --> 24:40.150
- There they are.
- Derek, Ahsha.

24:40.312 --> 24:42.735
- Yeah. Over here, please.
- Hey, Derek.

24:43.440 --> 24:47.866
You've had those photos since last
night and you're sitting on them why?

24:50.030 --> 24:52.658
What are you talking about,
<i>Du Monde?</i>

25:01.917 --> 25:04.386
They were dating.
Did you know that?

25:04.503 --> 25:07.973
Pete said they're coming together
tonight, a sort of damage-control thing.

25:08.132 --> 25:10.851
That's why they asked everyone
to come.

25:11.010 --> 25:13.058
As a show of support.

25:14.221 --> 25:16.223
I'll be right back.

25:16.765 --> 25:19.564
- Can we get Ahsha alone?
- Only if I get copies.

25:20.227 --> 25:21.649
Derek.

25:22.646 --> 25:23.989
That's great, guys. Awesome.

25:24.106 --> 25:26.404
- Who are you wearing?
- Maxazria

25:26.567 --> 25:28.865
and my shoes are Badgley Misch--
Mischka.

25:28.986 --> 25:30.329
Badgley Mischka.

25:30.487 --> 25:32.535
How long have you and Derek
been dating?

25:32.781 --> 25:35.204
Not long. We were friends first.

25:35.367 --> 25:37.040
How did you meet?

25:37.745 --> 25:40.089
Well, we were volunteering at this...

25:42.166 --> 25:45.966
Actually, the first time we met,
I was running laps around the arena.

25:46.420 --> 25:47.842
I ran into him.

25:48.005 --> 25:49.348
He's, like, 9 feet tall.

25:49.465 --> 25:51.342
I fell for him, literally, on my butt.

25:51.467 --> 25:54.016
I had a bruise for a week.

25:54.386 --> 25:57.936
- You look absolutely beautiful.
- Thank you so much.

25:58.098 --> 25:59.520
Be careful with her.

25:59.683 --> 26:02.277
Oh, the overprotective dad thing,
I dig it.

26:02.895 --> 26:05.193
No, I don't think you do.

26:05.355 --> 26:09.451
I know every trick in the player book.
I know every excuse you can make,

26:09.610 --> 26:13.080
every event that you can use
for a cover.

26:14.031 --> 26:19.288
If you do anything to hurt my daughter,
I will kill you.

26:25.417 --> 26:29.263
- Derek.
- Can we get one with you and Ahsha?

26:29.421 --> 26:30.718
What is--?

26:30.881 --> 26:32.428
Coach D, right here.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.810
Well, there you go.

26:35.469 --> 26:38.063
Got nothing to say.
I can't say anything to follow that.

26:38.180 --> 26:40.524
- Thank you.
- Okay, thank you.

26:42.893 --> 26:44.611
- Lionel, over here, please.
- Lionel.

26:44.770 --> 26:46.693
Look this way.

27:05.124 --> 27:07.422
- Yeah.
- Derek and Ahsha are here.

27:07.543 --> 27:09.295
Together.

27:10.754 --> 27:12.597
And you know what that means.

27:12.756 --> 27:15.726
Being a public couple, the attention
that comes along with that.

27:15.884 --> 27:18.057
Are you willing to let Derek
take what's yours?

27:19.596 --> 27:21.644
This isn't about me and Derek.

27:21.807 --> 27:23.150
It's about you and Ahsha.

27:23.392 --> 27:25.895
This is about power.

27:26.145 --> 27:28.068
No one's realised
that we're not a couple.

27:28.230 --> 27:29.948
You could get down here

27:30.107 --> 27:33.111
jump in front of some cameras
with me, and...

27:37.156 --> 27:39.409
Look, Terrence...

27:45.164 --> 27:46.666
Hello?

27:49.126 --> 27:51.299
If Terrence and Jelena
meant anything to you,

27:51.461 --> 27:53.384
you'll put on a suit
and get down here.

28:04.975 --> 28:06.727
Want a drink?

28:07.144 --> 28:10.193
Yes, with my date Louis,
who will be here any minute.

28:10.355 --> 28:12.357
- No, he won't.
- Yes, he will.

28:12.524 --> 28:14.026
No, he won't.

28:14.193 --> 28:16.821
I went back
to pick up all your little outfits.

28:16.987 --> 28:20.082
You know, so you could have stuff
to wear for the next guy.

28:20.240 --> 28:21.662
I found Louis with them.

28:21.783 --> 28:24.411
Actually, I found Louis in them.

28:24.578 --> 28:29.004
Apparently, that's what he needed
to put the thrill in his drill.

28:29.291 --> 28:31.464
He didn't wanna give them back

28:32.044 --> 28:33.671
so he gave me this instead.

28:39.343 --> 28:42.768
This is $100,000.
He gave you all this for that?

28:42.930 --> 28:46.025
The rest is so you can go back
to school to become a sex therapist.

28:46.141 --> 28:48.064
He said, clearly, you have a gift.

28:49.853 --> 28:55.030
So 100 grand pays off Benny's debt.

28:56.151 --> 28:58.119
Kyle Hart

28:59.279 --> 29:01.031
free and clear.

29:02.741 --> 29:04.084
Divorce papers.

29:10.499 --> 29:13.173
This isn't a personal cheque.
This is a cashier's cheque.

29:15.545 --> 29:18.970
Unless you took Louis to the bank.

29:22.552 --> 29:24.099
You did this.

29:24.221 --> 29:26.064
You paid off the rest of Benny's debt.

29:27.349 --> 29:29.351
I'm like you, Kyle.

29:29.518 --> 29:31.111
I don't get attached.

29:33.897 --> 29:35.570
I can't.

29:35.983 --> 29:37.610
Well.

29:39.820 --> 29:46.544
What do you say we go somewhere
and not get attached together?

29:59.423 --> 30:03.098
This TMZ thing
had your fingerprints all over it.

30:04.052 --> 30:07.352
- Did it?
- You made a mistake.

30:07.514 --> 30:09.312
You underestimated me.

30:09.474 --> 30:11.397
You didn't count on people
having my back.

30:12.978 --> 30:15.072
Who has your back, Jelena?

30:31.079 --> 30:33.582
That's great, ladies. Thank you.
One more.

30:33.749 --> 30:35.296
Go close.

30:42.132 --> 30:44.476
Thank you for all your help.

30:44.843 --> 30:47.187
That's what I do, Pete. I'm a fixer.

30:47.804 --> 30:50.603
I also happened to notice
that story about us on TMZ.

30:51.099 --> 30:54.194
I had to give them something,
replace the Ahsha and Derek piece.

30:54.353 --> 30:56.355
It was quite the headline.

30:56.521 --> 31:00.276
Something like,
is there a thaw in the relationship

31:00.442 --> 31:02.115
between Pete
and Lionel Davenport?

31:02.944 --> 31:04.412
Well.

31:04.780 --> 31:06.077
Isn't there?

31:13.455 --> 31:15.674
Jude Kincaid.

31:15.832 --> 31:18.176
K- I- N--

31:18.460 --> 31:20.053
Hello?

31:25.634 --> 31:26.977
What?

31:27.135 --> 31:28.432
Oscar.

31:28.595 --> 31:30.097
Hey, yeah.

31:30.222 --> 31:31.724
Yeah, I have.

31:33.433 --> 31:36.653
Now, ladies, you look great.
Can you step in a little closer, please?

31:44.611 --> 31:46.158
Smile, girls.

31:51.451 --> 31:53.294
That's right.

31:53.620 --> 31:55.213
Good.

32:08.844 --> 32:10.437
Nice. Lovely.

32:14.099 --> 32:15.897
Thanks, guys.

32:16.101 --> 32:17.603
A little underdressed, no?

32:18.061 --> 32:19.688
I wanted to give you these.

32:26.486 --> 32:27.863
Plays? Here?

32:28.196 --> 32:31.291
Yeah, so you had time to look at them
before the next game.

32:31.450 --> 32:34.454
I've been studying how other teams
have nailed us in close games.

32:34.619 --> 32:36.212
These plays can cut down on that.

32:37.747 --> 32:40.216
They'll cut down on Derek
getting the ball.

32:40.375 --> 32:43.094
I know what you're thinking,
especially after today.

32:43.253 --> 32:46.132
That it's personal, but it's not.

32:48.467 --> 32:51.937
Look, I'm damned if I speak up
and I'm damned if I don't.

32:52.095 --> 32:53.938
I'd rather be damned with a ring.

32:58.101 --> 33:00.024
I'm leaving.

33:00.479 --> 33:02.197
The Jelena and Zero show
just started.

33:02.355 --> 33:04.824
I have to go to Olivia's will reading.

33:05.400 --> 33:09.746
I'd rather have whatever disease
this event is for than go to this thing.

33:09.863 --> 33:11.991
Hopefully, it'll be as brief
as her legacy.

33:21.875 --> 33:23.969
Oscar called Jude.

33:24.461 --> 33:28.307
Jude got them coverage of you working
that sexy dress.

33:28.715 --> 33:31.719
Some of it already made its way
to Japan.

33:32.302 --> 33:34.225
You'll live to dance another day.

33:39.434 --> 33:42.563
Ahsha, what--?
You're shaking.

33:42.729 --> 33:44.982
Talk to me.
Are you still scared or--?

33:45.148 --> 33:47.742
Of course I'm scared.

33:48.109 --> 33:51.488
I'm now officially
Derek Roman's girlfriend.

33:52.072 --> 33:54.416
Derek Roman, bad boy.

33:54.574 --> 33:58.624
Derek Roman who's never had
a girlfriend his entire life.

33:59.371 --> 34:02.420
Derek Roman who could break me
for the whole world to see.

34:03.208 --> 34:04.801
<i>Hey-</i>

34:06.127 --> 34:09.597
You forgot Derek Roman
that can do anything.

34:09.755 --> 34:13.431
Anything he puts his mind to.

34:15.011 --> 34:17.355
L-- I got this.

34:18.431 --> 34:19.978
I've got you.

34:21.434 --> 34:26.065
And I promise I will always,
always look out for you.

34:29.900 --> 34:31.574
I promise too.

34:41.288 --> 34:42.915
Maybe they have a chance.

34:43.956 --> 34:46.085
They're public now.

34:47.460 --> 34:50.804
In that world,
love has a lot of competition.

34:50.964 --> 34:55.264
I warned Derek I'd kill him
if he didn't look out for Ahsha.

34:55.594 --> 34:57.187
He promised he would.

34:59.889 --> 35:03.018
We promised
we'd look out for each other too.

35:10.609 --> 35:12.202
Still time to get a drink.

35:12.986 --> 35:16.536
Sorry, I have to go. I have some
Playground business to do.

35:27.042 --> 35:29.966
You definitely don't have
the same problem as Louis.

35:32.464 --> 35:34.933
You're also not like Benny.

35:40.847 --> 35:44.101
So we heading off to the next thing?

35:45.393 --> 35:47.020
Yeah.

35:47.270 --> 35:48.647
That's how we work.

35:48.813 --> 35:51.908
Well, just because this is over

35:52.025 --> 35:54.824
doesn't mean the night
has to be over, does it?

35:55.695 --> 35:57.117
Not at all.

36:05.872 --> 36:07.624
Oscar called from Japan.

36:09.417 --> 36:11.044
I'm still on the team.

36:11.211 --> 36:14.465
Oscar's still out of the country?
I thought he was back tonight.

36:14.756 --> 36:17.726
Tonight, tomorrow,
what's the difference?

36:18.301 --> 36:20.975
- I have to go.
- Aren't you going to say anything?

36:21.721 --> 36:24.065
About me and Derek? Warn me?

36:26.393 --> 36:30.273
This is something you're gonna have
to experience on your own, Ahsha.

36:46.162 --> 36:47.664
Where is everyone else?

36:47.831 --> 36:50.960
Oh, there is no everyone else.
It's just you.

36:51.501 --> 36:53.003
Please.

36:58.967 --> 37:02.972
Olivia's estate defers to Chase,
with one exception.

37:03.138 --> 37:05.311
Her 10 percent ownership
of the Devil Girls.

37:06.766 --> 37:08.109
She left that to me?

37:08.810 --> 37:10.107
No.

37:10.270 --> 37:14.525
But I was told you would know where
to find the person she did leave it to.

37:15.400 --> 37:16.902
Who's Vanessa Howard?

37:19.946 --> 37:21.789
My mother.

37:30.832 --> 37:32.584
Sloane?

37:38.006 --> 37:39.679
Sure thing, Oscar.

37:39.841 --> 37:42.014
I'd do anything for you.

38:49.911 --> 38:52.039
<i>Next time on Hit the Floor:</i>

38:52.205 --> 38:54.082
Mother's Day is coming early.

38:54.249 --> 38:57.549
But I never even met
this Olivia Vincent woman.

38:57.710 --> 39:00.805
That's for Derek. Tell him
it's from Monika with a K. He'll know.

39:01.798 --> 39:05.302
You're hiding things from me.
The groupies, the hangers-on.

39:05.426 --> 39:07.554
Don't you wanna know
what I found about you

39:07.720 --> 39:10.223
- in Olivia Vincent's police file?
- What did you say?

39:10.390 --> 39:12.609
Did you go see Olivia Vincent
before she died?

39:12.976 --> 39:14.819
I don't know
what you're talking about.

39:15.019 --> 39:16.612
I'm investigating Oscar.
