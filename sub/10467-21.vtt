10:31.195 --> 10:34.503
ROSALYN CUTLER.
ARE YOU HERE, ROSALYN?

10:44.252 --> 10:47.995
LAUREN. LAUREN...
WAIT.

10:47.995 --> 10:50.737
I KNOW WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE STAYING OUT OF
EACH OTHER'S WAY,

10:50.737 --> 10:52.739
BUT LET'S NOT
BE NUTS ABOUT IT.

10:52.739 --> 10:54.392
WILL YA SIT
FOR 5 MINUTES

10:54.392 --> 10:56.090
AND SHOW ME
WHICH END IS UP ON
THIS ACCOUNT SHEET?

10:56.090 --> 10:58.788
OK. IT'LL ONLY TAKE
5 MINUTES.

10:58.788 --> 11:00.311
THANK YOU.

11:03.619 --> 11:05.665
AHH...

11:08.711 --> 11:11.366
Sarah: BAILEY...

11:11.366 --> 11:12.672
SORRY.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.543
- HI.
- HEY.

11:14.543 --> 11:17.764
SARAH, THIS IS LAUREN,
MY NEW MANAGER.

11:17.764 --> 11:19.548
- HI.
- AND, LAUREN, THIS IS SARAH.

11:19.548 --> 11:21.811
HI. IS THIS A BAD TIME?
AM I INTERRUPTING SOMETHING?

11:21.811 --> 11:24.248
NO, NO, NOT AT ALL.
THIS...

11:24.248 --> 11:25.119
NO, WE CAN--

11:27.730 --> 11:29.645
UH, I'M GONNA GO.

11:29.645 --> 11:30.994
OK.

11:30.994 --> 11:31.995
Lauren: OK.

11:33.388 --> 11:35.433
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.
YEP.

11:35.433 --> 11:37.218
BYE.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

11:38.523 --> 11:39.524
HEY...

11:39.524 --> 11:40.830
HEY.

11:40.830 --> 11:42.440
SO I JUST CAME BY
TO TELL YOU

11:42.440 --> 11:44.660
THAT EVERYTHING'S
A LITTLE CRAZY,

11:44.660 --> 11:47.576
AND THE UNPACKING IS NOT
EXACTLY UNDER CONTROL.

11:47.576 --> 11:50.622
IT IS. IT'S GONNA BE,
BUT I THOUGHT I SHOULD CANCEL,

11:50.622 --> 11:52.363
SO I DID.

11:52.363 --> 11:53.843
CANCEL WHAT?

11:53.843 --> 11:57.760
BAILEY, THE SPELUNKING TRIP
FOR MY GEOLOGY CLASS.

11:57.760 --> 12:00.632
MAYBE IT IS
A GOOD IDEA.

12:00.632 --> 12:02.199
NOT CANCELING IT,

12:02.199 --> 12:04.593
BUT JUST PUTTING IT
OFF FOR NOW,

12:04.593 --> 12:06.943
WITH EVERYTHING
GOING ON RIGHT NOW.

12:06.943 --> 12:08.597
YEAH, I FIGURED.

12:08.597 --> 12:11.731
WE'RE NOT EVEN DONE WITH
THE MOVE AND THE HOUSE.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.384
RIGHT. THE HOUSE.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.083
SO I DID THE RIGHT THING.

12:17.214 --> 12:19.347
YEAH, I GUESS SO.

12:19.347 --> 12:21.131
JUST ASKING.

12:23.307 --> 12:25.048
Claudia: OK, YEAH.

12:25.048 --> 12:28.704
I WILL. I'LL CALL YOU LATER.
OK, SO, LISTEN, CHARLIE.

12:28.704 --> 12:31.751
YOU REMEMBER MELANIE
FROM GRIFFIN'S BAND, RIGHT?

12:31.751 --> 12:34.101
YEAH, I GUESS.

12:34.101 --> 12:36.277
OK, SO SHE AND SOME KIDS
ARE GOING DOWN TO THIS
CLUB TONIGHT,

12:36.277 --> 12:38.845
'CAUSE THEY HEAR THAT
R.E.M. IS GONNA BE PLAYING.

12:38.845 --> 12:40.803
IT'S ONE OF THOSE
SURPRISE GIGS

12:40.803 --> 12:42.544
THAT ONLY CLUB PEOPLE
KNOW ABOUT.

12:42.544 --> 12:44.764
OK, SWEETHEART,
LET'S GET YOU CLEANED UP.

12:44.764 --> 12:48.028
SO, LISTEN, THE BAND'S SUPPOSED
TO GO ON, MAYBE AROUND 8:00,

12:48.028 --> 12:49.812
WHICH PROBABLY MEANS 10:00.

12:49.812 --> 12:52.728
AND DRINKING--
ABSOLUTELY NO DRINKING.
I KNOW THAT.

12:52.728 --> 12:56.123
AND MELANIE'S PRACTICALLY,
WELL, SHE'S PRACTICALLY
AN ADULT.

12:56.123 --> 12:58.734
SO, FOR THAT MATTER,
SO AM I.

12:58.734 --> 13:00.997
SO, UM, I WAS
JUST WONDERING...

13:00.997 --> 13:05.132
CLAUD, IT SOUNDS FINE.
JUST BE BACK BY 10:00.

13:05.132 --> 13:06.786
YOU THINK BAILEY
HAS ANY INTENTION

13:06.786 --> 13:08.526
OF EVER CLEANING
ANY OF THIS STUFF UP?

13:08.526 --> 13:10.267
ARE YOU EVEN
LISTENING TO ME?

13:10.267 --> 13:11.965
I JUST SAID THAT THEY WOULDN'T
PROBABLY GO ON UNTIL 10:00.

13:11.965 --> 13:13.575
I MEAN, MAYBE 11:00.

13:13.575 --> 13:16.230
OH, SORRY.

13:16.230 --> 13:17.971
UH, HOW'S MIDNIGHT
SOUND, THEN?

13:17.971 --> 13:21.322
12:00. WOW.
DO YOU MEAN IT?

13:21.322 --> 13:23.585
THIS IS YOU WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT, RIGHT?

13:23.585 --> 13:25.587
LAST TIME I CHECKED.

13:25.587 --> 13:28.503
GOOD. 'CAUSE I DON'T
WORRY ABOUT YOU, CLAUD.

13:28.503 --> 13:30.200
SHOULD I?

13:34.857 --> 13:36.119
ALL RIGHT.

13:37.599 --> 13:39.427
ONLY A FEW MORE BOXES.

13:49.437 --> 13:51.352
WHAT THE--

13:51.352 --> 13:53.702
"IS IT GOOD FOR YOU?"

13:53.702 --> 13:55.312
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

13:55.312 --> 13:57.053
I TURN MY BACK
FOR 15 SECONDS,

13:57.053 --> 13:59.360
AND CLAUDIA'S
COLLECTING CONDOMS

13:59.360 --> 14:02.406
AND--AND BIRTH CONTROL
PAMPHLETS.

14:02.406 --> 14:05.148
OH, BAILEY, RELAX, OK?
SO I TOOK CLAUDIA TO THE DOCTOR.

14:05.148 --> 14:07.934
YOU DID?

14:07.934 --> 14:10.850
YEAH. SOMEBODY'S GOTTA
TALK TO HER ABOUT THAT STUFF,

14:10.850 --> 14:13.200
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
IF YOU WANNA YELL AT ME,
THEN GO AHEAD.

14:13.200 --> 14:14.854
'CAUSE I KNOW THAT I DIDN'T
DO ANYTHING WRONG.

14:21.991 --> 14:24.472
SARAH, I'M SORRY.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

14:26.430 --> 14:27.605
YOU'RE RIGHT.

14:30.782 --> 14:33.481
HEY...HEY, LISTEN...

14:33.481 --> 14:34.786
I'M SORRY.

14:36.266 --> 14:38.703
I WANT YOU TO DO ME
A FAVOR, OK?

14:38.703 --> 14:42.098
YOU KNOW THAT TRIP--

14:42.098 --> 14:45.101
THE CAVE THING FOR
YOUR GEOLOGY CLASS?

14:45.101 --> 14:47.103
I WANT YOU TO CALL THEM
AND UNCANCEL IT.

14:47.103 --> 14:52.195
DON'T YOU THINK I KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE FOR YOU
HERE?

14:52.195 --> 14:54.415
OR HOW HARD I AM
TO GET ALONG WITH
RIGHT NOW?

14:54.415 --> 14:56.069
AND NONE OF IT'S
YOUR FAULT, SARAH,
NONE OF IT.

14:56.069 --> 14:59.942
OK? SO JUST GO
AND HAVE FUN.

14:59.942 --> 15:01.944
AND YOU'LL
BE HELPING ME,

15:01.944 --> 15:04.555
IF I CAN THINK
ABOUT YOU SOMEPLACE

15:04.555 --> 15:06.122
ENJOYING YOURSELF.

15:29.319 --> 15:30.364
AHEM.

15:31.452 --> 15:32.932
HI.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.369
IT'S SO EASY, ISN'T IT?

15:35.369 --> 15:37.066
HUH?

15:37.066 --> 15:38.720
TO CRITICIZE
SOMEONE'S WORK,
SOMEONE'S HARD WORK,

15:38.720 --> 15:39.939
AND THEN WALK AWAY.

15:39.939 --> 15:42.289
OH, BOY.

15:42.289 --> 15:44.378
HERE WE GO.

15:44.378 --> 15:46.728
YOU THINK I TOOK
THE EASY WAY OUT
WITH THAT STORY.

15:46.728 --> 15:48.164
YOU TOOK THE
EASY WAY OUT, TOO,

15:48.164 --> 15:49.992
BY SAYING WHAT YOU SAID
WITH NO SOLUTION.

15:49.992 --> 15:51.298
A SOLUTION?

15:51.298 --> 15:52.908
I WAS TRYING, YOU KNOW,

15:52.908 --> 15:54.562
TO SAY SOMETHING
IN THAT STORY.

15:54.562 --> 15:56.346
YEAH, YOU SAID
IT WAS PERSONAL--

15:56.346 --> 15:58.348
THIS IS MY WORLD, OK,

15:58.348 --> 15:59.523
AND MAYBE IT'S NOT
INTERESTING TO SOMEONE

15:59.523 --> 16:01.003
WHO'S PUBLISHED
OR WON AWARDS,

16:01.003 --> 16:02.744
BUT IT MIGHT BE INTERESTING
TO SOMEONE BORING LIKE ME.

16:02.744 --> 16:04.702
YOU'RE NOT BORING.
YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT.

16:04.702 --> 16:06.226
NO, BUT APPARENTLY
YOU THINK--

16:06.226 --> 16:09.490
WHAT I THINK IS YOU GOT
ALL THIS ATTITUDE,

16:09.490 --> 16:11.448
BUT YOU'RE GOOD.

16:11.448 --> 16:13.015
YOU'RE A WRITER.

16:13.015 --> 16:15.148
SURE, I'M A WRITER.

16:15.148 --> 16:16.323
THAT'S WHY YOU
TRASHED MY STORY.

16:16.323 --> 16:18.107
THAT'S WHY
YOU TRASHED ME.

16:20.892 --> 16:23.460
LOOK, I'M NOT GOOD
UP THERE.

16:23.460 --> 16:25.288
I KNOW.

16:25.288 --> 16:27.682
LIKE WHEN I DON'T LIKE
SOMEONE'S WORK

16:27.682 --> 16:28.988
AND I DON'T WANNA
DEAL WITH IT,

16:28.988 --> 16:31.860
I SAY SOMETHING LIKE,
"HEY, NICE JOB"

16:31.860 --> 16:34.776
OR "GOOD EAR
FOR LOCAL COLOR."
SOMETHING.

16:34.776 --> 16:37.431
BUT WHEN
I ADMIRE A WRITER,

16:37.431 --> 16:41.348
I--I READ THEIR STUFF
LIKE I WOULD MY OWN.
I'M TOUGH ON IT.

16:41.348 --> 16:44.177
THAT'S HOW I TREAT
A WRITER I RESPECT.

16:45.613 --> 16:47.310
OHH.

16:49.138 --> 16:51.097
YOU STILL GOT IT ON YOU?

16:51.097 --> 16:52.446
THE STORY.

16:54.535 --> 16:56.798
MAYBE I SHOULD TAKE
ANOTHER LOOK AT IT.

17:01.803 --> 17:05.415
OH, DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG
IT'S BEEN, CHARLIE?

17:05.415 --> 17:06.416
WHAT?

17:06.416 --> 17:09.463
SINCE I'VE
LIVED ON MY OWN?

17:09.463 --> 17:11.160
SINCE I'VE HAD...

17:11.160 --> 17:14.816
AN ANSWERING MACHINE
WITH MY NAME ON IT?

17:14.816 --> 17:17.079
AND--AND...

17:17.079 --> 17:19.212
FOOD IN THE FRIDGE
THAT I LIKE?

17:19.212 --> 17:22.911
A GUY ON MY COUCH
THAT...I CAN HAVE
ANY TIME I WANT?

17:22.911 --> 17:24.391
[BOTH CHUCKLE]

17:25.783 --> 17:27.611
I COULD GET USED TO THAT.

17:27.611 --> 17:29.048
WHO COULDN'T?

17:30.658 --> 17:33.269
NOW I FEEL GUILTY.

17:33.269 --> 17:34.531
WHY?

17:34.531 --> 17:36.142
A--I'VE PROBABLY JINXED IT,

17:36.142 --> 17:38.231
AND B--I'M JUST
MAKING YOU JEALOUS.

17:38.231 --> 17:40.972
HEH. JEALOUS?
NO WAY.

17:40.972 --> 17:43.105
I CAN JUST
COME OVER HERE,

17:43.105 --> 17:44.672
AND YOU GOTTA
PAY THE RENT.

17:44.672 --> 17:46.978
OK, THAT DOES IT.

17:46.978 --> 17:49.503
YOUR SHARE OF THE PIZZA
JUST DOUBLED.
NO WAY.

17:49.503 --> 17:51.374
GIMME YOUR WALLET.
GIVE IT. GIVE IT TO ME.

17:51.374 --> 17:52.854
NO WAY. NO WAY.

17:52.854 --> 17:54.160
THAT PIZZA
WAS ON YOU.

17:54.160 --> 17:55.161
OHH.

18:08.870 --> 18:11.394
ALL RIGHT,
DO IT FAST, LADIES,
WHAT ARE YOU HAVING?

18:11.394 --> 18:13.179
UM, I'LL TAKE A, UH...

18:13.179 --> 18:14.484
UH...

18:14.484 --> 18:16.399
UM...

18:16.399 --> 18:17.400
MELANIE.

18:17.400 --> 18:19.576
HOW'S YOUR
WHOLE EXISTENCE?

18:19.576 --> 18:20.577
HEY.

18:20.577 --> 18:21.622
OH.

18:21.622 --> 18:23.145
I DIDN'T SEE YOU.

18:24.538 --> 18:26.496
UM, SO...

18:26.496 --> 18:28.629
WHAT'S THE DEAL,
YOU GUYS CAME
HERE TOGETHER?

18:28.629 --> 18:30.239
UM...

18:30.239 --> 18:31.545
WHAT, DID YOU, LIKE,
INVITE HIM HERE, TOO?

18:31.545 --> 18:34.635
NO, I JUST, UH, WASN'T SURE
YOU'D BOTH SHOW UP.

18:34.635 --> 18:37.507
MELANIE, YOU PRACTICALLY
DRAGGED ME HERE.

18:37.507 --> 18:39.683
YOU KNOW, I BET R.E.M.
ISN'T EVEN PLAYING HERE,
PROBABLY, RIGHT?

18:39.683 --> 18:41.337
I--I HAD TO.

18:41.337 --> 18:43.383
OK? YOU GUYS...

18:43.383 --> 18:44.819
YOU NEVER SHOULD HAVE
BROKEN UP.

18:44.819 --> 18:45.950
MELANIE,
THIS IS REALLY--

18:45.950 --> 18:47.822
OK, WAIT! LISTEN...

18:47.822 --> 18:50.172
YOU DUMPED HIM 'CAUSE
HE STOLE THAT PICK, RIGHT?

18:50.172 --> 18:51.173
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.

18:51.173 --> 18:52.392
WELL, YOU SHOULD KNOW,

18:52.392 --> 18:54.394
HE'S NOT THE KIND OF GUY
WHO DOES THAT.

18:54.394 --> 18:56.700
IN FACT, WHEN HE
GAVE IT BACK TO HIS BOSS,

18:56.700 --> 18:58.615
HE BOUGHT HIM ONE OF
COLTRANE'S SAX REEDS

18:58.615 --> 18:59.529
TO FILL OUT
HIS COLLECTION.

19:01.314 --> 19:03.794
OK, SO, WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO SAY?

19:03.794 --> 19:06.014
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M JUST
GONNA LEAVE YOU GUYS BE,
OK?

19:08.147 --> 19:09.322
BYE.

19:13.978 --> 19:17.504
♪ SARCASTIC
SILVER SWIRL ♪

19:17.504 --> 19:18.940
CHARLIE.

19:18.940 --> 19:21.377
♪ THE DAY
THAT IT RAINED... ♪

19:21.377 --> 19:22.944
CHARLIE!

19:22.944 --> 19:23.945
HEY.

19:23.945 --> 19:25.468
HEY.

19:25.468 --> 19:26.730
I GOT SOME HOUSE STUFF.
AND YOU KNOW THE RULE,

19:26.730 --> 19:27.601
I DON'T DO A THING
UNTIL WE TALK.

19:27.601 --> 19:29.994
OK.

19:29.994 --> 19:33.694
OK, FIRST OFF,
MY CONTRACTOR...

19:33.694 --> 19:36.914
OUR CONTRACTOR
CHECKED THE ELECTRICAL,

19:36.914 --> 19:39.090
AND DO YOU KNOW HOW OLD
THIS SYSTEM IS?

19:39.090 --> 19:40.396
70 YEARS.

19:40.396 --> 19:42.920
IT'S DEPRESSION WIRING,
SO MANNY SAYS

19:42.920 --> 19:43.921
THE--THE SOONER
WE REPLACE IT,

19:43.921 --> 19:45.706
THE MORE IT'LL SAVE US,

19:45.706 --> 19:47.011
BECAUSE THE CODE
CONSTANTLY CHANGES.

19:47.011 --> 19:48.099
I WONDER HOW MUCH
HE'S GOING TO CHARGE US

19:48.099 --> 19:50.363
TO SAVE US ALL THAT MONEY?

19:50.363 --> 19:52.887
UH, WELL, HEY, IT'S--

19:52.887 --> 19:54.976
I'M NOT SAYING
WE HAVE TO DO IT.
IT'S YOUR DECISION.

19:54.976 --> 19:57.021
OK, WHAT ELSE? I GOT
ANOTHER MILE TO GO HERE.

19:57.021 --> 20:00.764
WELL, IT'S JUST, UH...
CLAUDIA.

20:00.764 --> 20:02.331
I KNOCKED
HER KNAPSACK OVER,

20:02.331 --> 20:05.595
AND I FOUND ALL OF THESE
CONDOMS IN THERE

20:05.595 --> 20:10.861
AND--AND PAMPHLETS
ON BIRTH CONTROL
AND ORAL SEX.

20:10.861 --> 20:14.604
RIGHT. I MEAN, SARAH TOOK HER
TO THE GYNECOLOGIST, RIGHT?

20:14.604 --> 20:17.259
YEAH, SHE DID, BUT
WH-WHAT I'M SAYING IS

20:17.259 --> 20:18.826
I'M WONDERING
WHO'S ON TOP
OF ALL THIS STUFF,

20:18.826 --> 20:21.002
BECAUSE HERE SHE IS
GETTING ALL THIS
INFORMATION

20:21.002 --> 20:22.786
FROM ALL
THESE DIFFERENT PEOPLE,

20:22.786 --> 20:24.310
AND I'M JUST WONDERING
IF, MAYBE,

20:24.310 --> 20:27.138
SOMEBODY SHOULD HAVE
A CONVERSATION WITH HER.

20:27.138 --> 20:28.618
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

20:30.577 --> 20:32.840
WELL, IT'S JUST A--
A POLICY QUESTION.

20:32.840 --> 20:35.408
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT...
TELLING YOU WHAT
YOU SHOULD DO.

20:35.408 --> 20:37.105
IT'S COMPLETELY
UP TO YOU.

20:37.105 --> 20:42.415
RIGHT, LIKE, WITH THE HOUSE
AND THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM
AND...

20:42.415 --> 20:43.938
WELL, WAIT A SECOND--

20:43.938 --> 20:45.287
YOU KEEP SAYING
THAT IT'S ALL UP TO ME,

20:45.287 --> 20:47.463
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU MEAN.
YOU MEAN, IT'S UP TO ME

20:47.463 --> 20:48.856
AS LONG AS I MAKE
THE RIGHT DECISION.

20:48.856 --> 20:50.945
CAN I--CAN I
PLEASE START OVER?

20:50.945 --> 20:51.685
BECAUSE I'M NOT
DOING THIS RIGHT.

20:51.685 --> 20:53.339
JUST STOP, OK?

20:53.339 --> 20:55.471
JUST TAKE A LOOK
AT WHAT YOU'RE DOING HERE.

20:55.471 --> 20:56.907
YOU BRING UP ALL THESE THINGS

20:56.907 --> 20:59.040
AND YOU CALL THEM
POLICY QUESTIONS,

20:59.040 --> 21:02.304
BUT I MEAN, THEY'RE NOT
REALLY QUESTIONS,
ARE THEY?

21:02.304 --> 21:03.436
LISTEN, IF YOU SEE
A BETTER WAY TO DO
ANYTHING AROUND HERE,

21:03.436 --> 21:05.438
JUST DO IT.

21:05.438 --> 21:07.701
JUST DON'T PRETEND THAT
THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

21:07.701 --> 21:08.919
OK?

21:15.056 --> 21:18.581
Perry:
NO, I SEE WHAT YOU DID.
I READ THE CHANGES.

21:18.581 --> 21:21.367
I STILL DON'T BUY IT.

21:21.367 --> 21:23.586
BUT WHY NOT?
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

21:23.586 --> 21:25.936
THIS IS BASED ON
SOMETHING THAT HAPPENED

21:25.936 --> 21:27.416
THAT I KNEW ABOUT.

21:27.416 --> 21:29.984
OK, BUT I DON'T CARE.

21:29.984 --> 21:32.073
HER BOYFRIEND'S
HITTING HER.

21:32.073 --> 21:34.467
I TOLD YOU,
I DON'T CARE.
IT'S NOT THE STORY.

21:34.467 --> 21:38.297
THE STORY IS WHY
SHE STAYS WITH HIM
AS LONG AS SHE DOES.

21:42.344 --> 21:44.259
IT'S HARD TO ANSWER,
RIGHT?

21:44.259 --> 21:48.045
THAT'S WHY IT'S
THE PART TO WRITE ABOUT,
BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW.

21:48.045 --> 21:50.961
NO, I DO KNOW WHY
SHE STAYED. I DO.

21:50.961 --> 21:52.963
IT WAS BECAUSE I--

21:52.963 --> 21:54.791
IT'S OK.

21:54.791 --> 21:56.532
GO AHEAD.

21:59.666 --> 22:02.408
IT WAS BECAUSE I...

22:04.018 --> 22:06.150
KEPT TAKING
ALL OF HIS INTENSITY

22:06.150 --> 22:09.676
AND ALL THAT
ATTENTION FOR LOVE.

22:11.417 --> 22:13.375
MISTAKE. HMM?

22:14.811 --> 22:16.857
YEAH, IT WAS.

22:20.426 --> 22:24.038
I KNOW. IT HURTS...

22:24.038 --> 22:26.257
BUT DON'T BE AFRAID
TO FEEL IT.

22:27.998 --> 22:29.913
OK.

22:40.141 --> 22:42.230
[TELEPHONE RINGING]

22:42.230 --> 22:43.971
OH, CHARLIE,
I NEED YOUR KEY.
THE PHONE'S RINGING.

22:43.971 --> 22:45.494
KIRSTEN,
WAIT A SECOND.

22:45.494 --> 22:48.671
THERE'S
ICE CREAM IN HERE.
YOU WANT IT TO MELT?

22:52.588 --> 22:54.416
I DON'T WANT
TO HEAR THE MESSAGE.

22:54.416 --> 22:56.636
IT'S PROBABLY FOR BAILEY.
JUST LET HIM GET IT LATER.

22:56.636 --> 23:00.509
I DON'T WANT TO SEE
THE DISHES IN THE SINK.

23:00.509 --> 23:03.686
I DON'T WANT TO LOOK AT
THE BILLS ON THE COUNTER.

23:03.686 --> 23:07.342
I JUST WANT TO SIT HERE
WITH YOU AND DIANA.

23:09.518 --> 23:11.433
Machine: HI, WE CAN'T COME
TO THE PHONE RIGHT NOW,

23:11.433 --> 23:13.522
BUT LEAVE A MESSAGE AND
WE'LL CALL YOU BACK. THANKS.

23:25.665 --> 23:28.972
I JUST WANT
TO HEAR THE...

23:28.972 --> 23:31.279
MICHAELSON'S
SPRINKLER SYSTEM.

23:31.279 --> 23:33.194
[LAUGHS]

23:36.327 --> 23:38.199
THEY'VE GOT A VALVE
THAT NEEDS REPLACING.
YOU HEAR THAT?

23:38.199 --> 23:39.983
UH-HUH.

23:39.983 --> 23:40.941
BUT NOT BY ME.

23:40.941 --> 23:41.942
NO.

23:41.942 --> 23:42.856
[LAUGHS]

23:45.511 --> 23:46.947
Julia: SO, DID YOU
SLEEP WITH HIM?

23:46.947 --> 23:48.644
WHO?

23:48.644 --> 23:51.386
2 A.M. BARRY.
THE GUY WHO READ WHITMAN
INTO YOUR MACHINE.

23:51.386 --> 23:53.954
DID THE POETRY WORK?

23:53.954 --> 23:56.565
WHITMAN WASN'T
ENOUGH TO GET ME
INTO BARRY'S BED.

23:56.565 --> 23:57.914
HMM.

23:57.914 --> 23:59.742
HE HAD A ROOMMATE,
THOUGH.

23:59.742 --> 24:01.831
OOH, A LOVE TRIANGLE.

24:01.831 --> 24:04.704
MAN, IS THERE, LIKE,
ANYTHING THAT
YOU DON'T ASK ABOUT?

24:04.704 --> 24:06.619
COME ON,
PERRY, TELL ME.

24:06.619 --> 24:09.535
I TOLD YOU MINE.
SO, WHAT HAPPENED?

24:09.535 --> 24:10.710
NO, THANKS.

24:10.710 --> 24:14.714
WE HAD A FIGHT, I GUESS.

24:14.714 --> 24:17.412
I THOUGHT WE WERE OVER,
BUT THEN I FOUND A NOTE

24:17.412 --> 24:20.720
THAT HE SLIPPED
INTO MY BACKPACK.

24:20.720 --> 24:24.288
SAID TO MEET HIM
UP ON WEST ROCK.

24:24.288 --> 24:27.074
WE USED TO GO THERE
AND HAVE SEX.

24:27.074 --> 24:31.078
AND THAT'S WHEN
I FOUND HIM.

24:31.078 --> 24:35.169
AND IT WAS GOOD FRIDAY,
AND HE'D LEFT YOU
ANOTHER NOTE

24:35.169 --> 24:38.215
ABOUT HEAVEN AND SACRIFICE
AND HOW MUCH HE LOVED YOU.

24:38.215 --> 24:40.304
I GUESS
YOU READ MY STORY, HUH?

24:40.304 --> 24:43.394
I CRIED FOR A WEEK.

24:43.394 --> 24:45.614
WOW...

24:45.614 --> 24:47.747
SO, ALL THAT
REALLY HAPPENED, HUH?

24:47.747 --> 24:49.444
LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT IT.

24:51.751 --> 24:54.928
BUT, PERRY, YOU WROTE IT.
IT'S ALL THERE IN YOUR BOOK.

24:56.364 --> 24:57.670
YOU'RE FUNNY.

24:57.670 --> 24:59.410
I'M---

24:59.410 --> 25:01.891
YOU JUST ARE.
YOU WANT EVERYTHING
OUT IN THE OPEN.

25:03.458 --> 25:06.940
WELL, THAT'S...WHAT YOU DO.

25:06.940 --> 25:08.681
IN YOUR WRITING,
YOU GO SO DEEP,
YOU BRING EVERYTHING OUT.

25:08.681 --> 25:10.987
IN MY WRITING. EXACTLY.

25:13.773 --> 25:14.948
LOOK, I'VE GOT TO GO,
OK?

25:19.953 --> 25:21.650
BOOK SIGNING LATER, RIGHT?

25:28.048 --> 25:29.092
HMM.

25:29.092 --> 25:30.746
LISTEN, SALINGER,

25:30.746 --> 25:34.010
I'M SORRY ABOUT
THAT THING WITH CODY.

25:34.010 --> 25:36.535
IT'S JUST--I MEAN,
I CAN TELL FROM
THE WAY HE TALKS

25:36.535 --> 25:38.014
THAT HE'S REALLY INTO YOU.

25:38.014 --> 25:40.321
OH, YEAH, RIGHT.
MELANIE, PLEASE.

25:40.321 --> 25:43.019
HE'S JUST SO GREAT,
THAT'S ALL.

25:43.019 --> 25:46.980
I MEAN, HE'S GOT EVERY TUNE
IN HIS BEAUTIFUL HEAD FROM--

25:46.980 --> 25:49.373
FROM, LIKE, ELVIS TO MOZART.

25:49.373 --> 25:51.637
OK, MELANIE, COULD YOU
JUST LAY OFF ABOUT CODY?

25:51.637 --> 25:53.987
I MEAN,
YOU THINK HE'S SO GREAT,

25:53.987 --> 25:55.118
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
DATE HIM YOURSELF.

25:56.598 --> 25:58.600
I ALREADY DID, REMEMBER?

25:58.600 --> 26:01.951
AND NOW HE'S INTO
SOMEBODY ELSE...

26:01.951 --> 26:05.128
AND I GUESS YOU ARE,
TOO.

26:05.128 --> 26:06.956
I'M WHAT?

26:06.956 --> 26:09.568
OH, NO. NUH-UH.
NO, I'M NOT.

26:09.568 --> 26:11.265
WE PLAYED IN
A BAND TOGETHER, CLAUD.

26:11.265 --> 26:13.310
I SAW WHERE
YOUR EYES WERE GOING.

26:13.310 --> 26:16.313
I MEAN, EVERY TIME
YOU COOKED ON SOME SOLO,

26:16.313 --> 26:17.401
YOU DID IT
FOR ONE PERSON ONLY.

26:17.401 --> 26:18.968
GRIFFIN.

26:20.709 --> 26:22.102
YOU'RE--
YOU'RE WRONG. NO.

26:22.102 --> 26:26.323
IT'S OK. WE ALL HAD
A CRUSH ON HIM,

26:26.323 --> 26:31.241
BUT HE'S, LIKE,
FANTASY LAND,
YOU KNOW?

26:31.241 --> 26:33.809
I MEAN,
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

26:33.809 --> 26:35.724
YEAH, I KNOW THAT.

26:36.856 --> 26:39.859
SO, CODY'S FOR REAL.

26:39.859 --> 26:44.080
AND I JUST--
I CAN'T HELP THINKING...

26:44.080 --> 26:47.954
I MEAN, UNLESS FANTASY LAND
IS ACTUALLY WHERE
YOU WANT TO LIVE.

26:53.002 --> 26:54.787
CHARLIE?

26:54.787 --> 26:56.702
CHARLIE, YOU HERE?

27:23.076 --> 27:25.078
WOW, THIS IS PRETTY COOL.

27:25.078 --> 27:27.080
HEY.

27:27.080 --> 27:30.083
LISTEN, I'M KIND OF
BUSY RIGHT NOW.

27:30.083 --> 27:32.346
I KNOW. IT'S JUST
WE TALKED ABOUT HAVING
COFFEE AFTER THE SIGNING.

27:32.346 --> 27:34.130
I THOUGHT I'D COME BY EARLY,
MAYBE GET MY COPY SIGNED.

27:34.130 --> 27:36.045
OH, YEAH, LISTEN, UM...

27:36.045 --> 27:37.003
I'M NOT GOING TO BE ABLE
TO DO THE COFFEE.

27:37.003 --> 27:39.179
I, UM,
I MADE SOME OTHER PLANS.

27:40.528 --> 27:42.443
OH.

27:42.443 --> 27:45.315
OK, WELL, WE'LL JUST
FIND ANOTHER TIME THEN
TO GET TOGETHER.

27:45.315 --> 27:49.493
UM, CAN WE JUST SAY I'LL
SEE YOU WHEN I SEE YOU?

27:49.493 --> 27:51.844
Woman:
MISS MARKS?

27:51.844 --> 27:53.672
HI. THANKS FOR COMING.

27:53.672 --> 27:55.282
THANK YOU.

27:55.282 --> 27:56.892
AND WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

27:56.892 --> 27:58.328
MY NAME'S MARCIE.

27:58.328 --> 28:00.635
- MARCIE. OK.
- I-E.

28:07.860 --> 28:09.862
OK, GUYS,
GOOD JOB CLEANING UP

28:09.862 --> 28:11.341
AND WE'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

28:11.341 --> 28:14.736
SEE YOU TOMORROW,
MR. SALINGER.

28:14.736 --> 28:18.435
SO...WHAT,
WE HAVE A FEW

28:18.435 --> 28:22.701
MINOR DISAGREEMENTS
AND YOU PACK A SUITCASE?

28:22.701 --> 28:25.312
WHAT'S GOING ON, CHARLIE?
YOU TAKING A TRIP?

28:26.661 --> 28:28.837
NO, IT'S, UH...

28:28.837 --> 28:30.230
IT'S A LITTLE MORE
THAN THAT.

28:30.230 --> 28:31.710
IT'S MORE THAN THAT?

28:31.710 --> 28:34.016
WHAT? WHAT'S GOING ON?

28:34.016 --> 28:35.801
WHAT ARE YOU--
ARE YOU LEAVING?

28:35.801 --> 28:36.976
ARE YOU LEAVING
THE HOUSE?

28:36.976 --> 28:38.151
YEAH.

28:39.543 --> 28:40.675
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

28:40.675 --> 28:41.676
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE DOING THIS.

28:41.676 --> 28:43.199
OK, LISTEN TO ME. OK?

28:43.199 --> 28:45.636
I WON'T SAY ANOTHER WORD,
NOT ONE WORD.

28:45.636 --> 28:47.160
YOU CAN MAKE EVERY DECISION
IN THE HOUSE, OK?

28:47.160 --> 28:49.075
BAILEY, IT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH DECISIONS.

28:49.075 --> 28:50.119
IS IT STILL OWEN?

28:50.119 --> 28:51.120
NO.

28:51.120 --> 28:52.252
WELL, THEN,
WHAT IS IT, CHARLIE?

28:52.252 --> 28:53.775
BECAUSE I BROUGHT UP
A COUPLE OF THINGS

28:53.775 --> 28:55.211
THAT I THOUGHT
WE SHOULD WORK ON

28:55.211 --> 28:56.822
BECAUSE I WANTED TO HELP.
I WAS TRYING TO HELP.

28:56.822 --> 28:58.562
I KNOW THAT, BAILEY.
I KNOW THAT!

28:58.562 --> 29:00.347
THAT'S WHAT YOU DO.
IT'S WHO YOU ARE.

29:00.347 --> 29:02.175
YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN
THAT WAY.

29:02.175 --> 29:03.132
WELL, SO, WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

29:03.132 --> 29:05.961
EVER SINCE
WE'VE BEEN ON OUR OWN,

29:05.961 --> 29:07.528
FROM THE DAY
THAT THEY WERE GONE,

29:07.528 --> 29:09.486
THAT DAY...

29:09.486 --> 29:11.750
YOU REMEMBER WHO TOOK
ALL THE PHONE CALLS
FROM THE FUNERAL HOME?

29:11.750 --> 29:14.361
WHO SAT UP THE WHOLE
NIGHT WITH CLAUDIA?

29:14.361 --> 29:16.102
IT'S--IT'S IN
YOUR NATURE, BAILEY.

29:16.102 --> 29:17.103
IT'S HOW
YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN,

29:17.103 --> 29:18.669
AND IT'S HOW
YOU SHOULD BE.

29:18.669 --> 29:20.497
WHAT ABOUT YOU THOUGH,
CHARLIE?

29:20.497 --> 29:21.324
BECAUSE YOU'RE THE ONE WHO'S
BEEN IN CHARGE THE WHOLE TIME.

29:21.324 --> 29:24.197
ONLY, I NEVER
WANTED THAT, BAILEY.

29:24.197 --> 29:25.894
IT WAS SOMETHING
THAT I HAD TO DO,

29:25.894 --> 29:28.114
AND I DID IT,
AND I'M GLAD
THAT I DID IT.

29:28.114 --> 29:31.117
BUT YOU,
YOU ACTUALLY ASKED,
AGAIN AND AGAIN.

29:31.117 --> 29:31.944
CHARLIE, CAN I HAVE
THE RESTAURANT?

29:31.944 --> 29:32.945
CHARLIE,
CAN I HAVE OWEN?

29:32.945 --> 29:34.598
OK--

29:34.598 --> 29:35.382
WHAT ABOUT THIS--
WHAT ABOUT THIS
HOUSE STUFF?

29:35.382 --> 29:36.513
CAN I--
CAN I TAKE THAT, TOO?

29:36.513 --> 29:37.906
YEAH, BUT I NEVER MEANT
FOR YOU TO LEAVE.

29:37.906 --> 29:38.864
SO, PLEASE, JUST
TELL ME WHAT I DID--

29:38.864 --> 29:40.474
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

29:40.474 --> 29:43.564
THIS IS NOT ABOUT YOU
TAKING SOMETHING
FROM ME, OK?

29:43.564 --> 29:45.914
THIS IS ABOUT YOU
GIVING ME SOMETHING.

29:45.914 --> 29:50.136
BAY, I'VE BEEN
DREAMING ABOUT THIS
FOR 5 YEARS, MAN.

29:50.136 --> 29:51.790
NOT ABOUT
LEAVING YOU GUYS BEHIND,

29:51.790 --> 29:54.749
BUT ABOUT
HAVING MY OWN...

29:54.749 --> 29:57.404
MY OWN LIFE...

29:57.404 --> 30:02.757
AND...I THINK
I SEE THAT, BAILEY...

30:02.757 --> 30:04.977
A LIFE ON MY OWN.

30:07.762 --> 30:09.242
ON YOUR OWN?

30:19.861 --> 30:21.080
[THUNDERS]

30:30.350 --> 30:33.135
CLAUDIA, HAS--
HAS SARAH CALLED HERE?

30:33.135 --> 30:35.007
NO.

30:35.007 --> 30:36.399
YOU SURE
SHE HASN'T CALLED?

30:36.399 --> 30:37.487
HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HER.

30:37.487 --> 30:39.011
IS EVERYTHING OK?

30:39.011 --> 30:41.100
I GAVE HER A CELL PHONE,
YOU'D THINK SHE'D CALL.

30:45.147 --> 30:47.889
Recording: THE CELLULAR CUSTOMER
YOU ARE TRYING TO REACH IS
UNAVAILABLE.

31:00.162 --> 31:01.642
- THERE YOU GO.
- THANK YOU.

31:04.645 --> 31:06.560
UH, EXCUSE ME.

31:06.560 --> 31:09.693
HI. I--I WAS HERE FOR
THE BOOK SIGNING EARLIER,

31:09.693 --> 31:11.652
AND I LEFT MY COPY
OF PERRY MARKS' BOOK.

31:11.652 --> 31:14.263
ACTUALLY, I LEFT IT WITH HER.
I'M KIND OF A FRIEND.

31:14.263 --> 31:15.003
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU HAD
ANY MORE COPIES.

31:15.003 --> 31:16.004
I'D LIKE TO GET ONE.

31:16.004 --> 31:17.310
AISLE 9, NEW SECTION.

31:17.310 --> 31:18.528
LESBIAN,
FEMINIST WRITERS.

31:18.528 --> 31:20.443
LESBIAN...WRITERS?

31:20.443 --> 31:23.185
GUESS YOU'RE NOT
A CLOSE FRIEND, ARE YOU?

31:32.629 --> 31:34.283
BAILEY.

31:34.283 --> 31:35.981
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED
TO BE AT THE RESTAURANT?

31:35.981 --> 31:36.982
WHAT ARE YOU--

31:36.982 --> 31:38.461
LOOK, I'M SORRY.

31:38.461 --> 31:40.289
I WAS--I WAS JUST--
I WAS DRIVING AROUND,

31:40.289 --> 31:42.770
AND I WAS TRYING TO...
THINK, AND--

31:42.770 --> 31:44.859
COME ON IN.
YOU'RE SOAKING WET.

31:47.775 --> 31:50.299
TAKE YOUR JACKET OFF.
I'LL GET YOU A TOWEL.

31:58.829 --> 32:01.354
IT'S REALLY COMING DOWN
OUT THERE.

32:01.354 --> 32:03.138
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

32:05.010 --> 32:07.142
WELL, TO TELL YOU
THE TRUTH, NO.

32:07.142 --> 32:09.362
NO, I'M NOT.

32:09.362 --> 32:10.798
UM...

32:10.798 --> 32:11.712
HERE.

32:15.020 --> 32:16.847
LOOK, LAUREN, I KNOW
I SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

32:16.847 --> 32:18.675
OK? I KNOW THAT.

32:18.675 --> 32:21.330
IT'S JUST...
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE.

32:21.330 --> 32:24.464
YOU'RE THE ONLY PERSON
WHO--WHO GETS THIS.

32:24.464 --> 32:25.900
WHO KNOWS
WHAT THIS IS LIKE.

32:25.900 --> 32:28.381
KNOWS WHAT?

32:28.381 --> 32:32.559
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO...
WANT TO CONTROL
EVERYTHING...

32:32.559 --> 32:36.867
IN YOUR LIFE AND TO WRAP
YOURSELF AROUND SO MUCH.

32:36.867 --> 32:37.564
DO YOU KNOW--
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

32:37.564 --> 32:39.305
I DO.

32:39.305 --> 32:42.264
OK, I KNOW.
I KNOW YOU DO.

32:42.264 --> 32:44.745
THIS IS WHY
I NEEDED YOU.

32:47.574 --> 32:53.972
WAIT, WAIT.
LAUREN, WAIT.

32:53.972 --> 32:58.193
I'M SORRY, I CAN'T--
I CAN'T DO THAT.

33:00.979 --> 33:02.545
THEN WHY DID YOU
COME HERE, BAILEY?

33:04.808 --> 33:06.636
BECAUSE...

33:08.029 --> 33:09.813
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
THAT YOU WOULD--

33:09.813 --> 33:10.989
YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND.

33:13.817 --> 33:15.123
IT'S TOO MUCH.

33:15.123 --> 33:18.648
I'M TRYING TO DO
TOO MUCH. EVEN THIS--

33:18.648 --> 33:19.998
EVEN WHAT
WE'RE DOING HERE.

33:19.998 --> 33:22.043
I'M TAKING
MORE AND MORE ON

33:22.043 --> 33:25.351
UNTIL IT'S MORE THAN
I CAN HANDLE...

33:25.351 --> 33:28.049
AND--AND THEN...

33:28.049 --> 33:31.052
I'M PUSHING
EVERYTHING AWAY.

33:31.052 --> 33:34.273
EVERYTHING.

33:34.273 --> 33:39.278
EVEN THE PEOPLE THAT
I CARE ABOUT THE MOST...

33:40.670 --> 33:42.455
AND I CAN'T DO THAT.

33:45.023 --> 33:46.241
WOW.

33:49.766 --> 33:52.378
I'M TAKING THE JOB
AT HARVEST.

33:52.378 --> 33:55.381
MY STUFF WILL BE OUT OF
THE RESTAURANT TOMORROW.

33:55.381 --> 33:57.035
LAUREN--

33:57.035 --> 33:59.211
WHAT, ARE YOU GONNA TRY
TO TALK ME OUT OF IT AGAIN?

33:59.211 --> 34:01.691
NO, I'M NOT.

34:04.216 --> 34:07.480
I'M...I'M
REALLY SORRY.

34:09.177 --> 34:11.049
SO AM I.

34:16.445 --> 34:18.056
YOU COULD COME WITH ME NOW,

34:18.056 --> 34:19.579
AND THEN YOU COULD
CHANGE YOUR MIND LATER...

34:19.579 --> 34:21.059
WHATEVER FEELS RIGHT.

34:23.409 --> 34:25.019
NO.

34:30.590 --> 34:32.113
I WANT TO DECIDE.

34:32.113 --> 34:34.420
DON'T DO IT NOW
IF YOU'RE NOT READY.

34:36.813 --> 34:38.424
I DON'T THINK
I WANT TO GO.

34:41.731 --> 34:43.037
I WANT TO STAY.

34:48.347 --> 34:50.175
OK.

34:50.175 --> 34:51.654
CHARLIE...

34:51.654 --> 34:53.874
THIS HOUSE...

34:53.874 --> 34:55.832
THESE CREAKING WALLS...

34:55.832 --> 34:57.486
LEAKS...

34:59.880 --> 35:01.577
MY WHOLE LIFE
HAS HAPPENED HERE.

35:01.577 --> 35:04.014
MY WHOLE LIFE!

35:04.014 --> 35:05.320
THIS IS HOME.

35:06.582 --> 35:09.107
I GUESS I'M JUST...

35:09.107 --> 35:11.892
NOW WHERE YOU ARE YET,
YOU KNOW?

35:11.892 --> 35:15.113
I'M NOT GROWN UP ENOUGH
TO MOVE ON.

35:15.113 --> 35:20.161
OH, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THAT, CLAUD.

35:20.161 --> 35:22.294
SOMETIMES, LATELY,
I'LL TURN AROUND,

35:22.294 --> 35:24.078
AND I'LL SEE YOU
COME THROUGH A DOOR...

35:25.775 --> 35:27.864
YOU LOOK
SO MUCH LIKE HER...

35:27.864 --> 35:29.997
ALL GROWN UP.

35:29.997 --> 35:32.652
I WISH SHE WAS HERE
TO SEE YOU,

35:32.652 --> 35:35.045
'CAUSE I KNOW
HOW PROUD SHE'D BE.

35:35.045 --> 35:37.613
MOM WOULD BE PROUD
OF YOU, TOO, CHARLIE.

35:39.006 --> 35:43.706
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT IF I AM...

35:43.706 --> 35:47.057
IF I AM THAT GROWN UP...

35:47.057 --> 35:48.276
IT'S BECAUSE OF YOU.

35:51.366 --> 35:54.326
I AM SO HAPPY
FOR YOU, CHARLIE.

35:54.326 --> 35:56.154
YOU DESERVE THIS.

36:28.664 --> 36:30.579
SARAH.

36:30.579 --> 36:32.146
HEY.

36:32.146 --> 36:35.105
YOU'RE HOME.

36:35.105 --> 36:36.106
OHH.

36:36.106 --> 36:37.107
HI.

36:37.107 --> 36:38.108
HI.

36:38.108 --> 36:39.197
BAILEY, IT'S 3 A.M.

36:39.197 --> 36:42.722
TAKE OFF YOUR CLOTHES
AND GO TO SLEEP.

36:42.722 --> 36:46.160
NO, I WAITED UP
TO WELCOME YOU HOME.

36:48.467 --> 36:50.338
I MISSED YOU.

36:50.338 --> 36:52.949
BAILEY, I WAS ONLY GONE
FOR, LIKE, A DAY.

36:52.949 --> 36:56.431
I KNOW, BUT I STILL
MISSED YOU SO MUCH.

36:56.431 --> 36:59.826
REALLY? I DIDN'T EVEN
THINK YOU'D NOTICE.

36:59.826 --> 37:01.001
YOU'VE BEEN SO DISTRACTED.

37:01.001 --> 37:03.525
I KNOW, AND--
AND THAT'S GONNA CHANGE.

37:03.525 --> 37:06.311
THAT HAS TO CHANGE.

37:06.311 --> 37:07.834
'CAUSE...

37:10.924 --> 37:13.274
HOW DO I SAY THIS?

37:13.274 --> 37:14.275
WHAT?

37:17.452 --> 37:19.193
YOU--
YOU KNOW ABOUT CHARLIE?

37:19.193 --> 37:22.065
CLAUDIA SAID HE'S MOVING.

37:22.065 --> 37:25.330
YEAH, HE'S...MOVED.
HE'S GONE.

37:25.330 --> 37:28.202
WOW.

37:28.202 --> 37:30.987
HE'S LIVED IN THIS HOUSE
HIS WHOLE LIVE, SARAH.

37:30.987 --> 37:33.251
HE'S RUN THIS HOUSE
SINCE MY PARENTS
WERE GONE.

37:33.251 --> 37:35.992
HE'S RUN OUR FAMILY.

37:35.992 --> 37:38.778
AND I DON'T KNOW
THAT I EVER REALLY
KNEW THAT UNTIL NOW.

37:40.562 --> 37:42.912
AND THERE'S SO MUCH
IN MY LIFE NOW...

37:42.912 --> 37:45.045
SO MUCH THAT I HAVE TO
TAKE CARE OF...

37:45.045 --> 37:47.308
AND I HAVE ASKED
FOR ALL OF IT,
SO I'M NOT SORRY.

37:49.528 --> 37:53.009
AS LONG AS YOU KNOW
ONE THING:

37:53.009 --> 37:55.969
NONE OF IT MATTERS
MORE TO ME THAN YOU DO.

37:57.057 --> 37:59.277
NONE OF IT.

37:59.277 --> 38:02.410
BECAUSE
I WILL NEVER TAKE

38:02.410 --> 38:04.760
SOMEONE THAT I LOVE
FOR GRANTED AGAIN...
EVER.

38:06.501 --> 38:08.677
DO YOU HEAR ME?
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M SAYING?

38:09.809 --> 38:13.639
YEAH, I THINK SO.

38:13.639 --> 38:15.510
GOOD.

38:25.390 --> 38:27.740
Perry: IF YOU GUYS THINK ABOUT
THE CONCEPT OF WRITING,

38:27.740 --> 38:29.916
AND WHAT IT IS THAT
YOU'RE REALLY WRITING ABOUT,

38:29.916 --> 38:31.352
IT'S GONNA BE THERE.

38:31.352 --> 38:33.485
OK, WE'LL SEE YOU GUYS.

38:33.485 --> 38:35.138
THANK YOU.

38:35.138 --> 38:36.357
THANKS.

38:36.357 --> 38:38.054
OH, THIS LOOKS LIKE
A GOOD ONE.

38:40.013 --> 38:43.495
BYE. THANKS.

38:43.495 --> 38:45.061
SO, ONE MINUTE
WE'RE FRIENDS,

38:45.061 --> 38:47.150
AND THE NEXT MINUTE
WE'RE NOT?

38:47.150 --> 38:50.328
IS IT BECAUSE I'M JUST
A COLLEGE STUDENT?

38:50.328 --> 38:53.461
OR...OR IS IT MAYBE
BECAUSE YOU DECIDED

38:53.461 --> 38:55.158
I'M A CRAPPY WRITER,
AFTER ALL? OR...

38:55.158 --> 38:56.986
OR IS IT THE GAY THING?

38:56.986 --> 38:58.771
IN WHICH CASE,
HELLO, PERRY, IT'S
THE NINETIES. WHO CARES?

38:58.771 --> 39:00.163
JULIA--

39:00.163 --> 39:01.251
I MEAN, YOU'RE
TELLING ME STORIES

39:01.251 --> 39:03.079
ABOUT THE BOYFRIENDS
YOU'VE HAD.

39:03.079 --> 39:05.430
LOOK, I--I HAVE HAD
BOYFRIENDS, OK?

39:05.430 --> 39:07.214
I--I DID HAVE--

39:07.214 --> 39:09.390
OK, BUT THEN--
THEN WHY NOT TELL ME
THE WHOLE TRUTH?

39:09.390 --> 39:11.740
I MEAN, YOU LET ME COME
TO MY OWN CONCLUSION.

39:11.740 --> 39:13.568
YOU LET ME THINK THAT
WE WERE UNDERSTANDING
EACH OTHER,

39:13.568 --> 39:14.569
THAT WE KNEW EACH OTHER,

39:14.569 --> 39:15.962
WHEN, REALLY,
I HAD NO IDEA.

39:18.094 --> 39:20.923
THAT STORY WAS TRUE.

39:20.923 --> 39:22.751
WHAT'S ALSO TRUE
IS THAT I AM GAY NOW.

39:22.751 --> 39:26.146
IT'S NOT SOMETHING
THAT I TELL PEOPLE
WHEN I FIRST MEET THEM.

39:28.801 --> 39:32.935
LOOK, YOU KNOW, JULIA,
I--I TOLD YOU,
I'M NOT LIKE YOU.

39:32.935 --> 39:38.071
YOU TALK ABOUT STUFF.
YOU LET EVERYTHING IN.
YOU LET EVERYTHING OUT.

39:38.071 --> 39:39.594
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE
YOU'RE BRAVER THAN I AM.

39:39.594 --> 39:40.987
MAYBE...

39:42.858 --> 39:44.599
MAYBE YOU JUST DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE ME.

39:46.122 --> 39:49.561
WELL, HOW CAN I
IF YOU DON'T TELL ME?

39:49.561 --> 39:51.998
I MEAN,
IF WE WERE FRIENDS,
YOU'D TELL ME.

39:56.132 --> 39:57.699
OR MAYBE THAT'S
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

39:57.699 --> 40:00.310
MAYBE YOU'RE SAYING THAT
WE CAN'T BE FRIENDS.

40:00.310 --> 40:04.097
NO, I GUESS
WHAT I'M SAYING IS...

40:04.097 --> 40:05.794
WE ALREADY ARE.

40:09.450 --> 40:12.671
LISTEN, UH, I'M GONNA START
LOOKING FOR AN APARTMENT
TOMORROW,

40:12.671 --> 40:16.631
BUT, UH, DIANA AND I WILL
JUST CRASH HERE TONIGHT,

40:16.631 --> 40:18.024
IF THAT'S OK.

40:18.024 --> 40:19.895
UM...

40:22.507 --> 40:25.205
CHARLIE, IT'S--
IT'S FINE.

40:25.205 --> 40:28.338
I MEAN, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THAT.

40:28.338 --> 40:29.775
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
START LOOKING RIGHT AWAY.

40:29.775 --> 40:30.993
OH, YES, I DO.

40:30.993 --> 40:33.039
I MEAN...

40:33.039 --> 40:37.130
YOU TOLD ME BEFORE
HOW GREAT IT IS TO HAVE
YOUR OWN PLACE, SO...

40:37.130 --> 40:38.871
WELL, YEAH,
THAT'S RIGHT. IT IS.

40:38.871 --> 40:39.872
[LAUGHS]

40:39.872 --> 40:41.308
WELL, GOOD.

40:41.308 --> 40:43.528
THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE THAT.

40:43.528 --> 40:46.139
YEAH, BUT I'M JUST--
I'M SAYING THAT...

40:46.139 --> 40:48.141
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO THAT NOW.

40:48.141 --> 40:50.448
YOU CAN STAY FOR AWHILE.

40:50.448 --> 40:52.145
THAT'S FINE.

41:14.776 --> 41:17.039
SO, I HEARD R.E.M. MIGHT
BE PLAYING HERE TONIGHT.

41:18.171 --> 41:20.782
IT'S A LONG SHOT, BUT...

41:20.782 --> 41:21.653
YOU NEVER KNOW.

41:23.524 --> 41:28.224
YEAH, SOMETIMES...
PEOPLE SURPRISE YOU.

41:28.224 --> 41:30.966
YEAH, I GUESS, YEAH.

41:39.845 --> 41:43.588
SO, WON'T YOUR
BROTHERS FREAK...
THAT YOU'RE HERE?

41:43.588 --> 41:44.850
IT'S PRETTY LATE.

41:44.850 --> 41:46.808
I CAME HERE
'CAUSE I WANTED TO, CODY.

41:49.245 --> 41:53.946
AND MELANIE SAID
THAT...YOU MIGHT BE HERE.

41:53.946 --> 41:57.166
I'M JUST SAYING,
FORGET MY BROTHERS.

41:57.166 --> 41:58.167
I'M HERE TO BE
WITH YOU.

41:58.167 --> 41:59.778
OH.
