00:53.800 --> 00:56.530
This won't do.
It just won't do.

00:56.530 --> 00:58.070
Jenkins, have you seen Eve?

00:58.130 --> 00:59.600
No, sir.
Oh, but while I have you,

00:59.670 --> 01:01.340
we need to discuss
the Tethering Ceremony.

01:01.410 --> 01:02.810
Love to,
but I'm taking Eve bowling.

01:02.870 --> 01:05.610
Been polishing my balls
all week.

01:05.680 --> 01:08.740
Scratch that.
That didn't come out right.

01:08.750 --> 01:10.810
Please, Mr. Carsen,
the equinox is
fast approaching,

01:10.880 --> 01:13.820
and it's been weeks
since we rehearsed
the Tethering Ceremony.

01:13.880 --> 01:17.420
Has it? I...
I hadn't noticed that. Eve?

01:17.490 --> 01:19.950
Sir, I can't but think
you're avoiding the subject.

01:19.960 --> 01:22.090
- Avoiding what subject?
- Tethering.

01:22.160 --> 01:24.760
- Have you seen Eve?
- No. I was actually looking
for her myself.

01:24.760 --> 01:26.960
She was supposed to help me
catalogue the Dead Sea Scrolls.

01:27.030 --> 01:28.760
Why is he avoiding Tethering?

01:28.770 --> 01:30.630
- Exactly.
- I am not avoiding.

01:30.700 --> 01:32.840
I just have questions.

01:32.900 --> 01:35.640
- Oh, you mean doubts.
- Are you going to completely
ignore everything

01:35.710 --> 01:37.770
that Darrington Dare said
about there ever only being
one Librarian?

01:37.840 --> 01:41.040
Excuse me, sir,
but with all due respect
to Mr. Dare, screw him.

01:42.780 --> 01:45.850
His fears of a Librarian
civil war are antiquated,

01:45.920 --> 01:47.580
and I may say
bordering the paranoid.

01:47.650 --> 01:49.580
Wait, there's a Librarian
civil war?

01:49.650 --> 01:52.590
No...
Sir, quite frankly,

01:52.660 --> 01:54.860
I think that your doubts
have less to do with Mr. Dare

01:54.930 --> 01:57.060
and more to do
with Ms. Noone.

01:57.130 --> 02:01.060
- Do you now?
- Hey, where's Baird?
She never showed up to spar.

02:01.130 --> 02:04.470
Ever since she reentered
your life, you've been
dragging your feet.

02:04.540 --> 02:06.540
- Who? Baird?
- No, Nicole. Keep up.

02:06.600 --> 02:09.000
Dragging my feet?
Maybe with good reason,

02:09.070 --> 02:10.740
especially with the way
the Library has treated her.

02:10.810 --> 02:12.540
- Are we doing this again?
- Yep.

02:12.610 --> 02:15.140
Mr. Carsen, I'll be happy to
debate the presumed innocence

02:15.210 --> 02:17.750
of Ms. Noone with you
as much as you'd like,

02:17.810 --> 02:23.620
but the fact remains
that in 41... yes, 41 days,

02:23.620 --> 02:26.150
the equinox will be upon us,
and if at that time

02:26.220 --> 02:29.820
the Library is not tethered,
to consequences will be
catastrophic.

02:29.890 --> 02:31.760
Hey, have any of you guys
seen Baird?

02:31.830 --> 02:33.160
No!

02:33.230 --> 02:35.160
No one has seen Colonel Baird.

02:35.230 --> 02:39.400
No one knows
where Colonel Baird... is.

02:44.840 --> 02:48.710
If you'd be so kind,
the facility will be
closing now.

02:48.780 --> 02:51.550
<i>Thank you for visiting
Wellington Arms Mortuary.</i>

03:28.890 --> 03:31.690
- Baird?
- Nice to see you, too.

03:31.760 --> 03:33.890
What are you doing here?
Have you been tracking me?

03:33.960 --> 03:36.830
You left us
without saying a word.
You just disappeared.

03:36.890 --> 03:39.160
I was kept a prisoner
for a hundred years.

03:39.230 --> 03:41.300
Sorry I wasn't excited
to go running back.

03:41.300 --> 03:44.170
I was trained to never
leave a soldier behind.

03:44.230 --> 03:47.570
They left you. It was wrong,
and I'm here to make it right.

03:47.640 --> 03:50.570
But that's not all of it, is it?

03:50.640 --> 03:52.570
You're still not sure
if I'm innocent

03:52.640 --> 03:54.040
or if Jenkins is right about me.

03:54.110 --> 03:56.180
Maybe I came to find out
for myself.

03:56.250 --> 03:59.180
I would love to help you,
but I'm busy.

03:59.250 --> 04:01.520
And you're in my way.

04:01.590 --> 04:04.120
Come back to the Library.
We could work together.

04:04.120 --> 04:05.920
You could be a Guardian again.

04:05.990 --> 04:07.590
I am a Guardian.

04:07.660 --> 04:09.790
What do you think
I'm doing here?
I'm on the job.

04:09.860 --> 04:12.190
- Then let me help you.
- No.

04:12.260 --> 04:16.529
For the last time,
I'm never going back
to the Library.

04:16.600 --> 04:17.529
I work alone.

04:25.940 --> 04:28.610
What were you thinking?
You led them right to me.

04:35.620 --> 04:38.220
This is the fourth one
of my graves they've looted.

04:38.290 --> 04:40.090
Your graves?
What do you mean?

04:40.160 --> 04:42.220
Only two men.
Shouldn't be hard to take down.

04:42.290 --> 04:43.830
Wait.

04:43.890 --> 04:46.030
You can't just charge them.
We need a tactical plan.

04:46.100 --> 04:48.830
I have one.
And what's with
all this "we" crap?

04:59.640 --> 05:01.180
Stay low. On my go.

05:01.250 --> 05:02.140
Yeah.

05:34.340 --> 05:36.140
Keep swinging like that,
you'll use all your energy!

05:36.210 --> 05:37.850
Don't tell me how to fight.

05:42.290 --> 05:46.660
I'm just saying,
a Krav Maga style would suit
your body type better.

05:48.430 --> 05:51.090
My body type?
I was made for Hapkido.

05:53.230 --> 05:56.030
Unlike you
and those wild haymakers.

05:56.030 --> 05:57.430
Your guy's not even down yet.

05:57.430 --> 05:59.700
I'm just setting up
for the choke hold.

06:02.110 --> 06:04.040
Air choke? Please.

06:04.040 --> 06:05.040
You need a blood choke.

06:07.710 --> 06:10.110
Look at your guy.
His eyelids are still
fluttering.

06:10.180 --> 06:13.120
- He's not even out yet.
- I could put my guy down
in four seconds.

06:13.180 --> 06:16.450
I can do it in three, two, one.

06:18.050 --> 06:20.050
Face it, Nicole, being locked up

06:20.060 --> 06:23.060
a hundred years
got you a little rusty.

06:23.130 --> 06:24.860
Who do you think you are?

06:24.860 --> 06:26.130
I've been doing this a long time

06:26.200 --> 06:29.060
and I'm a far better
Guardian than you.

06:29.130 --> 06:31.130
What? You sip some immortal
goo-goo-Ga-Ga juice

06:31.200 --> 06:32.330
you think you're God's
gift to Guardians?

06:32.400 --> 06:35.470
- Something like that.
- You are so delusional.

06:35.470 --> 06:38.740
If you don't believe me,
maybe we could ask them
who the better Guardian is.

06:38.810 --> 06:40.880
Okay, let's.

06:40.880 --> 06:43.210
- Where are they?
- Wait.

06:43.280 --> 06:45.080
They took it.

06:47.350 --> 06:50.750
You have no idea how badly
you've messed this up.

07:02.570 --> 07:04.300
They were after my artifacts,

07:04.300 --> 07:05.900
which I was trying to protect
until you showed up.

07:05.970 --> 07:10.840
So you've been
hiding artifacts
in graves, your graves.

07:10.910 --> 07:13.280
My graves are like
my own personal Library.

07:13.340 --> 07:15.440
What did they take?

07:15.510 --> 07:18.180
Something that leads
to Koschei's Needle.

07:18.250 --> 07:20.110
Needle?
Doesn't sound so bad.

07:20.120 --> 07:23.250
It's a weapon of war
so powerful it can
bring down kingdoms.

07:23.320 --> 07:24.850
Well, when you say it
like that...

07:24.920 --> 07:27.120
And now I have to find it
before they do.

07:27.120 --> 07:29.520
I'm coming with you.
I can help.

07:29.530 --> 07:32.130
Oh, like you did back there?
No, thank you.

07:32.200 --> 07:36.330
I'll prove you can trust me.
And the Library.

07:36.400 --> 07:40.200
You don't trust me to go after
an artifact on my own, do you?

07:40.270 --> 07:41.400
Thought so.

07:41.470 --> 07:43.470
Good seeing you again, Guardian.

07:43.540 --> 07:46.070
- Have a nice life.
- Nobody knows I'm here.

07:46.140 --> 07:47.810
One call and you've got
four Librarians

07:47.880 --> 07:50.350
and one grumpy Custodian
on your ass.

07:50.410 --> 07:54.150
So you can either deal with me
or you can deal with them.

07:54.150 --> 07:56.020
Your call.

07:58.020 --> 08:02.320
We find the Needle,
but after that,
we're done.

08:08.900 --> 08:11.170
We just need to make
a quick stop first.

08:15.570 --> 08:17.570
Still no answer.
It's going straight
to voicemail.

08:17.640 --> 08:19.840
All right, I just got back
from Baird's apartment.

08:19.910 --> 08:23.380
Her wallet's missing.
Her favorite boots are gone.
No sign of foul play, though.

08:23.450 --> 08:25.180
Well, it looks like
she used the door.

08:25.180 --> 08:27.380
- Does it say where?
- Multiple locations.

08:27.380 --> 08:30.320
Toledo, Munich, Kyoto,
Sao Paulo.

08:30.390 --> 08:32.390
I mean, she could have
literally gone anywhere.

08:32.390 --> 08:34.590
No, it's a smoke screen.
She's trying to cover
her tracks. She's...

08:34.659 --> 08:38.530
Or she took the red eye
from Portland to Heathrow.

08:38.600 --> 08:41.260
I may have hacked
her laptop, found her credit
card statements.

08:41.330 --> 08:44.400
Ezekiel,
that is private property
and completely inappropriate.

08:44.470 --> 08:46.000
Yeah, so is her browser history.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.340
What is she doing in England?

08:47.400 --> 08:49.600
DOSA might know something
about that.

08:49.610 --> 08:51.870
According to this,
they've been corresponding
for the last couple of weeks.

08:51.940 --> 08:55.080
She's even had them run
facial recognition software
on one particular person.

08:57.410 --> 08:59.350
- Nicole.
- Mm-hmm.
Her last known location

08:59.420 --> 09:01.420
was just outside
of Lancashire, England.

09:01.490 --> 09:03.350
I'm going after her.

09:03.420 --> 09:06.220
All right, so Baird
went after Nicole. Why?

09:06.220 --> 09:08.360
Probably to bring her back to
the Library to face her crimes.

09:08.430 --> 09:11.230
Maybe she went to apologize for
what the Library did to her.

09:11.230 --> 09:13.100
- Please.
- Maybe she just
wanted to grab

09:13.160 --> 09:15.160
a pint with a mate, you know?
Guardians' night out.

09:15.230 --> 09:17.430
Two Guardians alone together?

09:17.430 --> 09:19.430
Could be doing anything
to each other.

09:19.440 --> 09:21.900
- I'm coming with you.
- No, I'm going to
do this by myself.

09:21.970 --> 09:23.510
This is Nicole, and this is Eve.

09:23.570 --> 09:26.440
Yes. And sir, you are far
too emotionally involved.

09:26.510 --> 09:28.180
You have no objectivity.

09:28.250 --> 09:30.150
- And you do?
- I...

09:31.780 --> 09:35.380
Would you three stay, please,
and guard the Library?

09:35.450 --> 09:36.720
Both of you guys
are going on a mission?

09:36.790 --> 09:38.250
And we're staying here?

09:38.260 --> 09:42.190
Which means...
we get to be Jenkins!

09:42.260 --> 09:45.330
One door for Lancashire
coming right up!

10:00.010 --> 10:01.540
Do we make tea now?

11:17.350 --> 11:19.350
<i>Why are we at</i>
<i>another mortuary?</i>

11:19.420 --> 11:21.360
How many grave sites
do you have?

11:21.360 --> 11:23.290
Enough not to arouse suspicion.

11:23.360 --> 11:25.090
I'm immortal, remember?

11:25.160 --> 11:27.230
A grown woman
going over 20 years

11:27.300 --> 11:30.100
without any sign of aging
starts to look fishy.

11:30.170 --> 11:32.100
Hmm. Depends
who her doctor is.

11:32.170 --> 11:36.570
So help me understand this.
You faked your own death
every 20 years?

11:36.570 --> 11:38.310
For the last 500 years,

11:38.380 --> 11:40.240
each time starting over
in a new life

11:40.310 --> 11:41.380
in a new part of the world.

11:41.380 --> 11:43.650
Here we are.

11:43.710 --> 11:47.120
I use this as my sort of
safe-box

11:47.180 --> 11:48.280
in case I get into trouble.

11:49.720 --> 11:50.690
Ah.

11:53.390 --> 11:55.160
Put this aside, will you?

12:09.270 --> 12:11.610
These people in these photos,

12:11.610 --> 12:13.080
they were your friends?

12:13.140 --> 12:15.410
Enduring so many years,

12:15.480 --> 12:16.680
you find ways to live,

12:16.750 --> 12:20.150
make friends, lovers, family,

12:20.220 --> 12:22.620
always knowing you'll lose them.

12:26.420 --> 12:28.760
You've lived your whole life
saying good-bye.

12:30.830 --> 12:35.430
How on Earth did you keep going?

12:35.430 --> 12:37.100
Hope.

12:37.170 --> 12:41.770
I knew if I could just
keep surviving,

12:41.840 --> 12:44.640
there was a chance
I could see Flynn again.

12:44.640 --> 12:46.510
It gave me a reason.

12:46.580 --> 12:50.710
You know,
Flynn and I have agreed
to tether to the Library.

12:50.780 --> 12:52.380
Ah, yes,

12:52.450 --> 12:54.780
and then you'll
become immortal, too.

12:54.850 --> 13:00.520
I don't think I understood
everything that meant until now.

13:00.590 --> 13:04.760
Make damn sure
you've got a good reason.

13:10.940 --> 13:14.340
- A mortuary?
- This is where the driver
said he let Eve off.

13:14.410 --> 13:16.740
What is Colonel Baird
and Ms. Noone doing here?

13:16.810 --> 13:18.810
Hopefully not killing
each other.

13:18.880 --> 13:21.340
I do apologize,
but we're closed.

13:21.410 --> 13:22.750
Oh, can... we don't... it will
just take a couple of minutes.

13:22.810 --> 13:25.350
Yes, but I'm afraid
we had a situation

13:25.420 --> 13:27.750
in one of our lower rooms.
Left a ghastly mess.

13:27.820 --> 13:29.280
We should reopen tomorrow.

13:29.350 --> 13:31.220
You sure we can't just
take a quick visit?

13:31.290 --> 13:32.760
We can't wait till tomorrow.

13:32.820 --> 13:34.560
It's an eternal
resting place, sir.

13:34.630 --> 13:36.630
Whatever you need
will surely be here tomorrow.

13:36.690 --> 13:39.360
Yes, but...

13:39.430 --> 13:41.160
he may not.

13:41.230 --> 13:43.230
You see,
my grandfather's very sick.

13:43.300 --> 13:45.630
He just wants to see
where he's going to be buried.

13:45.700 --> 13:47.370
He has an incurable disease

13:47.440 --> 13:50.910
brought on by the virus
Murmurationis Pullum.

13:50.980 --> 13:53.040
He could croak at any moment.

13:53.110 --> 13:54.940
Oh?

13:55.010 --> 13:57.710
That's the virus attacking
his bronchopulmonary
lymph nodes.

13:57.780 --> 13:59.580
- Can you hear it?
- Yes, I do.

13:59.650 --> 14:01.920
It's a shame.
He looks quite well
on the outside.

14:01.990 --> 14:04.520
But on the inside,
complete mess.

14:04.520 --> 14:08.790
- Brains is mush.
- Sardine pants are tight.
Sardine pants are tight.

14:08.860 --> 14:11.390
And then there's
the involuntary spasms.

14:11.460 --> 14:15.530
Yes. Uh, yes.

14:15.600 --> 14:17.730
Yes, I... I see.

14:17.730 --> 14:19.200
He looks absolutely dreadful.

14:19.270 --> 14:21.740
Perhaps we can make
an exception just this once.

14:21.740 --> 14:24.340
Of course. Uh, please,
make yourself at home.

14:24.410 --> 14:26.210
There's cucumber water
in the parlor.

14:26.280 --> 14:29.210
- Cucumber water?
- Yes.

14:29.280 --> 14:30.850
Come, Grandfather, come.

14:33.820 --> 14:36.620
Murmurationis Pullum?
The screaming chicken?

14:36.690 --> 14:39.750
- Got us inside.
- Very good thing the man
did not know his Latin.

14:39.820 --> 14:41.890
Oh, so you had to pretend
that you were dying.

14:41.960 --> 14:44.830
Consider yourself lucky.
Look around you, Jenkins.

14:44.900 --> 14:47.230
Aren't you glad you never had
to deal with any of this?

14:47.300 --> 14:49.030
I don't know.

14:49.100 --> 14:51.570
I've lived a very
long time, yes.

14:51.570 --> 14:53.300
Fought the greatest battles.

14:53.370 --> 14:55.440
Lost my greatest love.

14:55.510 --> 14:57.710
Sometimes I wonder...

14:57.770 --> 15:02.140
would a final rest
actually be welcomed?

15:09.390 --> 15:10.990
Mm-hmm.

15:10.990 --> 15:14.390
Look at these boot marks.
Eve and Nicole were here.

15:14.390 --> 15:17.790
There was a fight.
Two men.

15:17.790 --> 15:19.460
Scuff marks.

15:19.530 --> 15:20.800
Broken glass.

15:20.870 --> 15:22.930
They went to the ground.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.000
They got up.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.070
Should have gone
with the blood choke.

15:26.140 --> 15:28.940
Sir.

15:29.010 --> 15:31.610
Hello.

15:31.610 --> 15:33.180
Found it.

15:34.680 --> 15:36.680
- What is it?
- What we came for.

15:36.750 --> 15:38.880
A Greek artifact
called Apollo's Tablet.

15:38.950 --> 15:40.420
It belongs in the Library.

15:40.480 --> 15:41.680
- What was that?
- Nothing.

15:41.750 --> 15:43.420
What does it do?

15:43.490 --> 15:45.350
I could be like a Librarian

15:45.420 --> 15:47.420
and give you a long-winded
answer about how Apollo

15:47.490 --> 15:49.690
was the god of prophecy
and insight, blah, blah, blah.

15:49.760 --> 15:51.830
- Please don't.
- Let's just say

15:51.830 --> 15:54.660
it points me
in the right direction.

15:56.700 --> 15:59.630
It's how we've been able
to locate magical artifacts
throughout the years.

15:59.700 --> 16:02.470
It's like the Clipping Book.
It gives you a clue
where to go.

16:04.580 --> 16:06.510
This doesn't look familiar.

16:06.580 --> 16:09.040
- Ukrainian signage.
- That's the Pripyat River.

16:09.110 --> 16:10.980
I did a tour there
during my NATO days.

16:11.050 --> 16:13.580
This is pointing to
the Polesie Forest in Ukraine.

16:13.650 --> 16:15.620
Then that's where we need to go.

16:17.790 --> 16:20.660
Help me get this
back in the crypt, will you?

16:25.530 --> 16:26.860
What are you doing?

16:26.930 --> 16:29.330
What I told you.
I work alone.

16:29.400 --> 16:32.000
Nicole, no! Damn you!

16:32.070 --> 16:33.700
Nicole!

17:17.510 --> 17:18.849
<i>Scusi, mi scusi, mi scusi.</i>

17:21.119 --> 17:24.119
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>we'll soon be departing</i>

17:24.190 --> 17:27.920
<i>our direct flight to Kiev,
so sit back, relax.</i>

17:27.990 --> 17:29.630
<i>We'll be on our way shortly.</i>

17:31.330 --> 17:33.600
You didn't think you'd
get away from me that easily.

17:39.200 --> 17:40.170
Come on, man.

17:41.940 --> 17:43.810
How was the mission?
Do you need another door?

17:43.870 --> 17:45.810
- Anything?
- I've been doing research

17:45.810 --> 17:46.940
on the key impression
you sent me.

17:47.010 --> 17:48.140
By the way, it's early Slavic,

17:48.210 --> 17:50.550
and they refer
to Koschei's Needle.

17:50.610 --> 17:52.680
Koschei, immortal god
of Russian mythology.

17:52.750 --> 17:54.220
Also known
as Koschei the Deathless.

17:54.220 --> 17:56.220
Rumor has it that
he protected his soul

17:56.290 --> 17:57.820
by hiding it in a needle.

17:57.890 --> 18:01.290
The needle being able to...

18:01.360 --> 18:03.220
slay thousands
in a single swipe.

18:03.230 --> 18:05.090
For centuries, madmen,
kings have sought its power,

18:05.160 --> 18:07.230
including the infamous
Grigori Rasputin.

18:07.300 --> 18:10.570
Oh, Rasputin? Long hair,
looks like he belongs
in a death metal band.

18:10.630 --> 18:13.840
Rasputin, 19th century
Russian occultist made famous

18:13.840 --> 18:15.500
for surviving multiple
assassination attempts

18:15.570 --> 18:18.170
until his ultimate murder
in 1916 Rasputin? No?

18:18.240 --> 18:19.980
What does any of this
have to do with Eve?

18:20.040 --> 18:21.780
Well, clearly Ms. Noone
is after the Needle,

18:21.850 --> 18:22.980
and Colonel Baird
is trying to stop her.

18:23.050 --> 18:24.980
Why would Nicole
want that Needle?

18:25.050 --> 18:26.780
Well, because along with
its power to kill thousands,

18:26.850 --> 18:30.650
the Needle can also
kill an immortal.

18:30.720 --> 18:32.250
She wants it to use against me.
She wants revenge.

18:32.260 --> 18:33.790
And here we go again!

18:33.860 --> 18:35.390
Maybe she was just trying
to protect it like she said

18:35.460 --> 18:36.790
she was doing when you
jailed her the last time.

18:36.860 --> 18:39.130
She's trying to bring down
the Library.

18:39.200 --> 18:41.000
Why can't you just look
at this from her point...

18:41.060 --> 18:43.060
Gentlemen, stop!
Both of you.

18:43.070 --> 18:45.670
It doesn't matter
what Nicole's motive is.

18:45.740 --> 18:47.140
What's important right now
is finding Eve.

18:47.200 --> 18:49.000
She's right.
Find the Needle
and we'll find Eve.

18:49.070 --> 18:50.870
Stone, do you have anything yet?

18:50.870 --> 18:53.070
The legend refers
to the Polesie Forest.

18:53.080 --> 18:54.740
However, I did find a riddle.

18:54.810 --> 18:57.680
"In an egg, within a duck,
within a hare,

18:57.750 --> 19:00.750
you will find it
in the crystal chest."

19:00.820 --> 19:02.020
Great. So we just have
to go to the forest,

19:02.090 --> 19:04.220
find a turduckin,
and we're aces.

19:04.290 --> 19:06.960
We figure out the riddle later.
Right now a trip to
the Polesie...

19:07.020 --> 19:08.220
Two steps ahead of you, sir.

19:13.760 --> 19:15.300
Is this the Pripyat River?

19:15.300 --> 19:17.830
Another four or five miles
north, I think.

19:17.900 --> 19:20.100
You think?
You mean you don't know?

19:20.170 --> 19:22.300
Well, I had a GPS,
but I dropped it

19:22.310 --> 19:23.570
while crawling through
the claustrophobic,

19:23.640 --> 19:25.770
death-smelling walls
of a mortuary.

19:25.840 --> 19:28.580
Four or five miles north
it is, then.

19:28.650 --> 19:30.250
Ukrainian military?

19:30.310 --> 19:32.310
Restricted zone.
Any sign of them, run,

19:32.380 --> 19:34.180
'cause they shoot first.

19:34.250 --> 19:36.920
Although being shot is probably
less of a concern for you,

19:36.990 --> 19:37.990
being immortal and all.

19:38.060 --> 19:39.390
It still hurts.

19:39.460 --> 19:41.660
Everything about
being immortal hurts.

19:43.130 --> 19:46.330
Nicole, in all your 500 years,

19:46.330 --> 19:49.000
did you ever tell anyone
about being immortal?

19:49.070 --> 19:51.670
Do you ever share
that burden with anyone?

19:51.740 --> 19:53.270
What good would that do?

19:53.340 --> 19:55.340
Well, you shouldn't have
to deal with it alone.

19:55.410 --> 19:57.140
Jenkins had Charlene.

19:57.140 --> 20:00.810
When I tether and become
immortal, I'll have Flynn.

20:00.880 --> 20:02.610
You have no one.

20:02.680 --> 20:06.950
Let me guess. This is another
pitch to join the Library.

20:06.950 --> 20:08.280
We're the ones who understand
what you're going through.

20:08.350 --> 20:10.350
We'll always be there for you.

20:10.350 --> 20:11.750
Why do you care so much

20:11.820 --> 20:13.220
if I come back to
the Library or not?

20:13.290 --> 20:15.220
I told you.
No one should be left behind.

20:15.290 --> 20:19.360
Yes, but this isn't really
about me, is it, Baird?

20:19.360 --> 20:22.960
It's about you.
You're scared.

20:22.970 --> 20:25.230
Because if I can leave
the Library,

20:25.300 --> 20:27.040
others could, too.

20:27.100 --> 20:29.440
The idea of losing
the Librarians terrifies you

20:29.510 --> 20:32.110
because without them,
who would you be?

20:32.180 --> 20:36.450
You're right.
I am afraid.

20:36.510 --> 20:38.850
I'm afraid I'll be alone.

20:38.920 --> 20:41.720
I'm afraid I'll end up like you.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.000
We could lose a full day
trying to get around this.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
We're gonna have to climb it.

20:56.070 --> 20:58.330
There.
Use the cracks in the rocks,
stack climb our way up.

20:58.400 --> 21:00.670
No, no, no, no.
Those cracks are too wide.

21:00.740 --> 21:01.670
We're gonna have
to slab climb it.

21:01.740 --> 21:03.270
Slab climb?
I'm sorry.

21:03.340 --> 21:05.940
- Have you ever climbed
a mountain before?
- Does K2 count?

21:06.010 --> 21:07.540
I bet you had an army
of sherpas to carry you up.

21:07.610 --> 21:10.080
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
We have to stop arguing.

21:10.150 --> 21:13.010
We're not gonna get anywhere
if we don't start working
together.

21:13.080 --> 21:17.090
- Fine.
- There's gotta be some way
up this sucker.

21:17.150 --> 21:19.550
- Just when you need
a Librarian.
- Oh, please.

21:19.620 --> 21:21.690
Those nerds would have
some complicated solution

21:21.760 --> 21:23.490
using counter-levers
and catapults.

21:23.560 --> 21:26.090
Or a helicopter made out of
a hair band and a coconut.

21:26.160 --> 21:28.900
There.

21:28.970 --> 21:31.170
That looks like
a promising hold.

21:31.230 --> 21:33.500
That looks way out of reach.

21:33.570 --> 21:35.300
Not if we do a soldier climb.

21:35.370 --> 21:37.440
I'll give you a boost up
to the first hold.

21:37.510 --> 21:40.310
And you grab my boots
and climb to that footing.

21:40.380 --> 21:43.950
Check out the big brain
on Baird.

22:06.200 --> 22:10.210
Hey! We did it.

22:10.270 --> 22:12.270
This double Guardian thing
ain't so bad.

22:12.280 --> 22:14.080
Who needs a Librarian?

22:14.150 --> 22:15.980
You do.

22:20.380 --> 22:21.980
Flynn? How did you...

22:22.050 --> 22:23.120
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

22:23.190 --> 22:25.050
We were so worried
about both of you.

22:25.120 --> 22:27.120
- Everything's good.
- You're okay?

22:27.190 --> 22:28.320
- Yeah.
- Really?

22:28.390 --> 22:29.990
'Cause just, you know,

22:30.060 --> 22:31.990
given your mutual feelings
of jealousy for me,

22:32.060 --> 22:33.930
- I thought
maybe you might be...
- Fighting over you?

22:34.000 --> 22:37.270
Over what we admire more,
his humility or his modesty.

22:38.470 --> 22:39.940
I came to bring Nicole back.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.540
Only a Guardian could
bring back another Guardian,

22:41.610 --> 22:43.270
and I knew you'd never
let me go alone.

22:43.270 --> 22:46.070
Does he ever trust you to do
anything by yourself?

22:46.140 --> 22:48.340
It is you who can't be
trusted, Ms. Noone.

22:48.410 --> 22:50.280
Nice to see you too, Jenkins.

22:50.280 --> 22:52.680
Jenkins, listen, they've been
raiding Nicole's graves.

22:52.680 --> 22:55.480
I was there, I saw it.
They're after a very
dangerous artifact.

22:55.490 --> 22:58.090
Koschei's Needle, yes, we know.
That's how we found you.

22:58.090 --> 22:59.360
And you won't find it
without this.

22:59.420 --> 23:01.690
You see, I triangulated
the Needle's exact location

23:01.760 --> 23:04.160
by deciphering
an ancient Slavic riddle.

23:04.230 --> 23:05.960
"In an egg, within a hare,
within a duck,

23:06.030 --> 23:08.230
- you will find it
in a crystal chest."
- Where is it?

23:08.300 --> 23:10.630
- Mr. Carsen, there's no need
to tell her...
- First, I deciphered

23:10.700 --> 23:13.040
the imagery, duck, egg, hare,
and then I remembered

23:13.100 --> 23:14.640
that in the ancient
Slavic Glagolitic alphabet,

23:14.700 --> 23:16.700
letters are given
numeric values.

23:16.710 --> 23:18.510
Mr. Carsen...
- So, so, so, so,
so all I had to do

23:18.510 --> 23:21.040
was write out the words, egg,
duck, hare, in Glagolitic,

23:21.110 --> 23:22.980
and then decipher it
into their numerical value,

23:23.050 --> 23:24.580
and then I get three sets
of numbers,

23:24.650 --> 23:26.450
which I used to triangulate
the Needle's exact location,

23:26.520 --> 23:28.520
which I then marked on this map.

23:28.520 --> 23:30.390
- We'd better hurry.
- No, no, no, no.

23:30.450 --> 23:34.060
- Not with you.
- Sorry, Jenkins.
It's Nicole's mission.

23:34.120 --> 23:35.590
I'm helping her finish it.

23:35.660 --> 23:38.190
Colonel!
Please, don't tell me
that you trust her now.

23:40.400 --> 23:41.660
Actually, I do.

23:41.730 --> 23:43.730
I am the only sane one
left around here!

23:43.730 --> 23:45.270
That is debatable.

23:45.340 --> 23:46.800
Colonel, during
your little hillside waltz,

23:46.870 --> 23:49.410
did she tell you
what the Needle is used for?

23:49.470 --> 23:52.070
It is used to kill an immortal.

23:52.140 --> 23:54.340
She wants to use it against me.

23:54.340 --> 23:57.080
- That's a lie.
- She has been plotting
against me for...

23:57.150 --> 23:59.420
Ukrainian military!
Run! Run!

24:27.650 --> 24:29.380
All clear.

24:36.520 --> 24:37.720
I think they're gone.

24:37.790 --> 24:39.390
What happened
to Eve and Jenkins?

24:43.730 --> 24:46.330
You're lucky we grabbed you
when we did.

24:46.400 --> 24:50.530
Ukrainian soldiers are not
known for their hospitality.

24:50.600 --> 24:53.470
- Who are you?
- Don't tell him anything,
Jenkins.

24:53.540 --> 24:56.400
These are the guys
who raided Nicole's graves
and attacked us.

24:56.410 --> 24:59.740
My men were not attacking you.
They were attacking
Nicole Noone!

24:59.810 --> 25:02.810
You should know that we are
not associates of Ms. Noone.

25:02.810 --> 25:06.350
The artifacts in her grave,
she stole them from us.

25:06.420 --> 25:09.150
We were merely
trying to stop her before
she did any more harm.

25:13.290 --> 25:18.230
Ehh, then perhaps we do
have something in common,

25:18.300 --> 25:22.630
for I, too, am trying
to stop her.

25:24.370 --> 25:29.270
Nicole Noone
destroyed my family.

25:34.380 --> 25:35.780
- I count five of them.
- They're the same men

25:35.850 --> 25:37.180
who were looking for the Needle.

25:41.520 --> 25:43.250
We've got to get out of here.

25:43.320 --> 25:45.120
We're not gonna just leave
Jenkins and Baird down there.

25:45.190 --> 25:47.720
You're a Librarian.
You know better than anyone.

25:47.790 --> 25:49.730
- The mission comes first.
- Yeah, but they're family.

25:49.790 --> 25:51.590
Doesn't that mean anything
to you anymore?

25:51.660 --> 25:55.460
Jenkins is a Knight.
Baird is a Guardian.

25:55.470 --> 25:56.530
Don't you think
they can handle it?

25:56.600 --> 25:58.600
Yeah, but we're a team.

25:58.670 --> 26:00.400
We rely on each other.

26:00.470 --> 26:03.410
And what Baird needs
from you right now
is a little bit of faith.

26:03.470 --> 26:05.670
She can take care of herself.

26:05.680 --> 26:09.280
She's a Guardian.
Treat her like one.

26:13.220 --> 26:18.420
Oh, we were imperial family
for more than 300 years.

26:18.490 --> 26:22.560
We ruled Old Russia
with a majestic hand.

26:22.630 --> 26:24.760
You're saying you're a
descendent of the Romanovs?

26:24.830 --> 26:27.230
But they were
all executed during
the Bolshevik revolution.

26:27.300 --> 26:31.570
Not all. I am descendant
of sole survivor.

26:31.640 --> 26:35.240
Years before our downfall,

26:35.310 --> 26:37.770
our family took in
a charming holy man.

26:37.840 --> 26:42.710
He offered counsel,
friendship, faith.

26:42.710 --> 26:44.580
But he was no prophet.

26:44.650 --> 26:46.650
He was charlatan.

26:46.720 --> 26:49.320
Grigori Rasputin?

26:49.390 --> 26:53.590
He corrupted our family
like a dark disease.

26:53.660 --> 26:56.790
He practiced sorcery,
black magic...

26:56.860 --> 26:58.860
I'm sorry, but what does any
of this have to do

26:58.930 --> 27:01.730
with Boris and Natasha
looting Nicole's graves?

27:01.730 --> 27:05.600
Rasputin learned his dark arts

27:05.670 --> 27:09.410
from an even more powerful
accomplice...

27:09.470 --> 27:10.810
Nicole Noone.

27:10.870 --> 27:13.480
Nicole and Rasputin?
Come on.

27:13.540 --> 27:16.810
Colonel, please, let him finish.

27:16.880 --> 27:19.680
Nicole and Rasputin
were searching

27:19.750 --> 27:23.890
for a very powerful artifact.

27:23.950 --> 27:26.290
The Koschei Needle.

27:26.360 --> 27:29.290
If they found it,

27:29.360 --> 27:32.290
both would have
become unstoppable.

27:32.360 --> 27:35.830
But fortunately, Rasputin was
killed before he succeeded.

27:35.900 --> 27:38.900
And Ms. Noone?

27:38.970 --> 27:41.500
It was rumored
she escaped death,

27:41.570 --> 27:45.240
but her story was passed down
in my family.

27:45.310 --> 27:47.640
We remained vigilant

27:47.710 --> 27:49.980
in the off chance
that she might return.

27:49.980 --> 27:54.520
And then, just months ago,

27:54.580 --> 27:56.650
there was a sighting.

27:56.720 --> 28:00.660
Nicole Noone was alive.

28:00.720 --> 28:03.590
And it is up to me

28:03.660 --> 28:06.390
to stop her from getting Needle.

28:06.400 --> 28:07.860
This is ridiculous, Jenkins.

28:07.930 --> 28:09.800
Nicole Noone isn't involved
in any of this.

28:09.800 --> 28:11.670
She could be, Colonel.
You don't know her like I do.

28:11.740 --> 28:14.400
No, I know her entirely
different than you do.

28:14.400 --> 28:16.810
I have visited her graves.
I've seen her past.

28:16.870 --> 28:18.070
I've seen the lives she's lived.

28:18.140 --> 28:20.010
I've seen the goodness in her.

28:20.080 --> 28:21.480
This is not Nicole.

28:21.550 --> 28:25.480
Then perhaps you have seen

28:25.550 --> 28:29.750
different past than I have.

28:29.820 --> 28:32.950
This is her with Rasputin.

28:33.020 --> 28:36.490
This is her, Nicole Noone.

28:36.560 --> 28:39.030
- Eh?
- Nicole.

28:39.030 --> 28:40.300
Eh?

28:43.900 --> 28:45.300
Where are we?

28:45.370 --> 28:47.300
Just on the outskirts
of Chernobyl.

28:47.370 --> 28:50.370
Chernobyl?
Like the nuclear disaster
Chernobyl?

28:50.440 --> 28:52.370
As opposed to
the rib shack Chernobyl?

28:52.440 --> 28:54.040
No, yeah,
I think it's just the one.

28:54.040 --> 28:56.710
We're just hiking through it.
No cause for alarm.

28:56.780 --> 29:00.380
Well, the government opened up
this area to limited tours
a few years back.

29:00.450 --> 29:03.720
They claim that
most of the radiation
has been contained.

29:03.790 --> 29:07.390
Oh, right.
Governments never lie
about ecological disasters.

29:07.460 --> 29:09.730
I am one step ahead
of your sarcasm.

29:09.790 --> 29:11.590
Homemade radiation detector.

29:11.660 --> 29:13.860
See, the phone's built-in
camera uses a silicon chip

29:13.930 --> 29:15.460
that can not only detect
visible light,

29:15.530 --> 29:17.870
but also higher wavelengths
like gamma rays.

29:17.940 --> 29:21.600
So, if we cover
the phone lens
with pine resin

29:21.670 --> 29:23.940
so that it only detects
high-powered gamma protons,

29:24.010 --> 29:27.610
and then we rewire it
so that any detection

29:27.680 --> 29:30.480
alerts us through
the speaker, voila.

29:30.480 --> 29:32.750
- No nukes is good nukes.
- And it'll work?

29:32.820 --> 29:34.480
We're fine as long
as we're outta here
in under four hours.

29:34.550 --> 29:38.090
Great.

29:38.160 --> 29:41.390
- Make that
two and a half hours.
- Okay.

29:47.630 --> 29:49.770
Nicole, let me ask you
a question.

29:49.830 --> 29:52.030
When you helped us
with the Alexandria Stones,

29:52.040 --> 29:54.170
why did you leave?
You didn't even say good-bye.

29:54.240 --> 29:56.840
After being locked up
in the Library,

29:56.840 --> 29:59.640
I had to get away.
You can understand that.

29:59.640 --> 30:01.110
Yes, I can, but why run from me?

30:01.180 --> 30:03.710
Because I was hoping
you would come after me.

30:03.780 --> 30:06.920
But you didn't. Baird did.

30:06.980 --> 30:08.780
My turn to ask you a question.

30:08.850 --> 30:12.190
- Why do you stay
at the Library?
- What do you mean?

30:12.260 --> 30:16.590
When I first met you,
you had your whole life
in front of you.

30:16.660 --> 30:18.590
You weren't just about the job.

30:18.660 --> 30:22.000
I was a nobody.
I was a floundering academic
with no purpose.

30:22.070 --> 30:23.200
The Library gave me one.

30:23.270 --> 30:26.600
No. It showed you
how to have purpose.

30:26.670 --> 30:28.740
There are three
other Librarians now.

30:28.810 --> 30:31.670
You could have passed
the torch, moved on.

30:31.740 --> 30:33.880
You could have been anything
you wanted to be.

30:33.880 --> 30:36.610
This is what I became.
This is who I am.

30:36.680 --> 30:39.010
And who is that?

30:39.080 --> 30:44.690
Did you ever get the chance
to truly define yourself
apart from the Library?

30:44.690 --> 30:46.820
I put everything into it.
It's my whole life.

30:46.890 --> 30:49.120
And that's just it, Flynn.

30:51.630 --> 30:54.100
It's taken your life.

30:54.170 --> 30:56.830
We're both prisoners
of the Library,

30:56.900 --> 30:58.730
only you can't see it.

31:15.790 --> 31:19.920
- What is this place?
- An old paper mill
from the looks of it.

31:19.990 --> 31:21.320
According to the coordinates,

31:21.320 --> 31:23.320
the Needle should
be buried in here.

31:23.390 --> 31:27.000
They must have built
over the top of it.

31:27.060 --> 31:28.860
Given enough time,
everything crumbles.

31:28.930 --> 31:31.000
You can't bury the past forever.

31:31.070 --> 31:34.270
Yes, but where is it?

31:34.340 --> 31:36.870
Wasn't there a last part
of the riddle?

31:36.940 --> 31:39.810
"In an egg, within a duck,
within a hare,

31:39.880 --> 31:41.940
you will find it
in a crystal chest."

31:42.010 --> 31:43.340
All right,
so like a treasure chest.

31:43.410 --> 31:46.010
Well, that depends on
how you translate it.

31:46.080 --> 31:48.020
It could be "jar,"
it could be a "container,"
it could be "crypt."

31:48.090 --> 31:52.750
It could be "mineral,"
like the mineral,
it could be quartz.

31:52.760 --> 31:54.690
Quartz.

31:54.760 --> 31:57.960
This is all quartz.

31:57.960 --> 32:03.170
Don't you see?
We are in a crystal chest.

32:04.640 --> 32:06.640
Hello.

32:09.770 --> 32:11.370
Ah-ha.

32:11.370 --> 32:13.780
Egg...

32:13.840 --> 32:17.110
duck, hare.

32:18.980 --> 32:21.050
It's activated some sort
of lifting mechanism

32:21.120 --> 32:23.620
on the other side of this wall.

32:33.860 --> 32:37.900
I never could forget how
much you amaze me, Flynn.

32:48.080 --> 32:49.280
It's like a Russian
nesting doll.

32:49.350 --> 32:51.350
Quite remarkable, really.

32:51.420 --> 32:53.350
It can't be defined
by one aspect.

32:53.420 --> 32:57.020
Each reveals a deeper layer,

32:57.020 --> 33:00.620
each one step closer
to its true heart.

33:02.030 --> 33:03.760
This one's locked.

33:03.830 --> 33:05.430
You cannot open it, sir,
without the key.

33:05.430 --> 33:06.960
Eve, what are you doing?

33:07.030 --> 33:08.160
Sorry, Flynn.

33:08.230 --> 33:10.170
We can't let Nicole
have the Needle.

33:10.230 --> 33:12.100
Please just step away
from the chest.

33:12.170 --> 33:14.040
No, no, no, no, no.
Nicole! Aah!

33:14.040 --> 33:15.770
Please don't make this
harder than it already is.

33:15.840 --> 33:18.040
- You're making a big mistake!
- I really wish I were.

33:28.720 --> 33:31.720
Now I think
the safest place for this
is the Library.

33:31.790 --> 33:34.120
No. You see, sir?
This is exactly what I meant.

33:34.190 --> 33:36.930
She was trying to get this
to use it in order to kill me.

33:36.990 --> 33:38.860
You're right, Jenkins.

33:38.930 --> 33:40.460
I want to use it,
but not to kill you.

33:40.530 --> 33:44.270
- To kill him.
- Nicole?

33:44.340 --> 33:46.270
This man is not
who he says he is.

33:46.340 --> 33:49.140
- He's Rasputin.
- The impudence!

33:49.210 --> 33:51.740
Rasputin destroyed my family.

33:51.810 --> 33:53.940
He was murdered for his crimes.

33:54.010 --> 33:56.280
He didn't die.
He somehow managed
to stay alive

33:56.350 --> 33:57.810
in this frail state
using dark magic,

33:57.880 --> 34:00.020
but I know who you are!
You can't hide from me!

34:00.080 --> 34:02.420
Do not believe word she says.

34:02.490 --> 34:05.490
We saw the photos, Nicole.
We saw you with Rasputin.

34:05.490 --> 34:08.159
I infiltrated his inner circle.

34:08.230 --> 34:09.830
I was the one who killed him.

34:09.889 --> 34:11.159
Or at least I thought I did.

34:11.230 --> 34:13.830
Lies! Keep this dagger
away from her.

34:13.900 --> 34:15.360
Listen to me.
I'm telling the truth.

34:15.429 --> 34:19.030
Jenkins, search your heart.
One immortal to another.

34:19.100 --> 34:20.969
You need to trust me.

34:23.239 --> 34:24.770
Wait! No!

34:24.840 --> 34:26.280
No! No!

34:48.530 --> 34:50.000
Rasputin.

34:55.639 --> 34:57.910
Kingdoms will fall,

34:57.980 --> 35:00.640
and all will kneel at my feet.

35:07.120 --> 35:08.580
Oh, my God, what have I done?

35:08.650 --> 35:11.250
- Can you save her?
- I don't know.

35:11.320 --> 35:13.460
That's not good enough!
Let's get her back to
the Library and try, damn it!

35:13.520 --> 35:17.530
Keep a door open for us.
We'll take care of him.

35:17.590 --> 35:20.130
Hey, Ruski!

35:20.200 --> 35:23.530
Oh, looks like your
little letter opener
ain't so tough after all.

35:23.600 --> 35:26.200
It's been dormant for centuries.

35:26.270 --> 35:27.800
It needs more souls.

35:30.010 --> 35:31.270
Time to go!

35:31.340 --> 35:33.940
You cannot escape,

35:34.010 --> 35:36.350
for I am deathless,

35:36.410 --> 35:41.080
and I will feed upon your lives.

35:41.080 --> 35:44.020
I couldn't protect her, Flynn.
I failed as a Guardian.

35:44.090 --> 35:46.290
Well, you were lied to
by one of the great
deceivers in history.

35:46.360 --> 35:47.490
Don't beat yourself up too bad.

35:47.560 --> 35:49.360
Still, I let one of my own down.

35:49.430 --> 35:54.430
Your friend Nicole
betrayed me years ago.

35:54.500 --> 35:57.970
Now her life fills my veins.

35:58.040 --> 36:00.970
And soon, yours will as well.

36:01.040 --> 36:02.700
What?

36:02.710 --> 36:04.370
What is that?
Someone's calling you now?

36:04.440 --> 36:06.510
Shut it off!

36:06.510 --> 36:08.240
No, it's not a phone call.

36:08.310 --> 36:09.980
There must be
a radiation leak
around here somewhere.

36:10.050 --> 36:11.710
Oh, great, so either
we die at the hands

36:11.720 --> 36:14.380
of a reincarnated madman
or we'll have radiation
poisoning.

36:16.190 --> 36:18.590
Do you want him to find us?

36:18.660 --> 36:19.650
Actually, yes.

36:19.720 --> 36:22.260
Wait! Flynn!

36:26.660 --> 36:28.200
Ha, ha.
Gotcha.

36:35.670 --> 36:38.010
You are strong, Guardian.

36:38.080 --> 36:39.340
You better believe it.

36:39.410 --> 36:41.410
You think you can kill me?

36:41.480 --> 36:44.010
Grigori Yefimovich Rasputin?

36:44.080 --> 36:45.750
Eve! The pipe!

36:45.750 --> 36:48.220
Countless others
have tried and failed,

36:48.290 --> 36:49.620
just like your pathetic friends.

36:49.690 --> 36:53.420
Then allow me to finish the job.

37:03.700 --> 37:06.570
A thousand sieverts
of radiation absorbed
into his body.

37:09.640 --> 37:11.770
Not even Rasputin
could survive that.

37:11.840 --> 37:12.940
Come on.

37:17.110 --> 37:18.780
Nicole, I'm so sorry.

37:18.780 --> 37:21.450
I should have done more.
I should have protected you.

37:21.520 --> 37:24.390
Nicole, it's okay.
I'm here. We all are.

37:25.590 --> 37:27.660
Nicole? Nicole?

37:27.720 --> 37:29.730
Mr. Carsen, please.
Do not touch her.

37:29.790 --> 37:31.730
Mr. Stone, I need you
to translate.

37:31.800 --> 37:34.130
- What is that? Buckthorn?
- Yes.

37:34.200 --> 37:37.330
"Friendship is vowing
toward immortality"

37:37.400 --> 37:40.600
and does not know
the passing away of beauty

37:40.600 --> 37:42.670
"because it aims
for the spirit."

37:42.740 --> 37:45.540
That's "The Epic of Gilgamesh."
Gilgamesh sent for Buckthorn

37:45.610 --> 37:47.680
to give him everlasting life.

37:47.740 --> 37:50.050
- Is this gonna save her?
- The only thing that can.

37:55.750 --> 37:58.450
- What... what is it doing?
- What is it doing?

38:01.890 --> 38:03.390
It's a transference ceremony.

38:05.360 --> 38:06.700
He's giving her his immortality.

38:06.760 --> 38:07.630
What?

38:13.240 --> 38:14.640
You will be mortal, like us.

38:14.710 --> 38:17.510
I was too angry.
I was too blind to see.

38:17.570 --> 38:19.840
All along, she was just
trying to save us.

38:19.910 --> 38:21.780
I just hope I can do
the same for her.

38:21.850 --> 38:26.250
- Jenkins!
- Mr. Stone, finish
the passage, please.

38:26.250 --> 38:30.450
Mr. Stone, I need you
to finish the passage!

38:36.590 --> 38:39.130
"Hold my hand in yours,"

38:39.200 --> 38:41.530
and we will not fear

38:41.600 --> 38:45.030
"what hands like ours can do."

38:50.870 --> 38:52.270
Ah!

38:52.340 --> 38:54.080
Jenkins. Jenkins.

38:59.620 --> 39:00.680
Jenkins.

39:03.620 --> 39:07.490
Thank you.

39:07.490 --> 39:10.760
- How will I ever repay you?
- You will, you will,

39:10.830 --> 39:14.400
just by making the most out
of the life that you now have.

39:24.240 --> 39:26.710
What will you do now?

39:26.710 --> 39:29.440
Who knows?
That's the fun of it
though, right?

39:29.510 --> 39:32.450
For better or for worse,

39:32.520 --> 39:35.920
I have been tied to
the Library for so many years.

39:35.990 --> 39:38.920
It's time I found out
who I can be

39:38.920 --> 39:40.390
apart from this place.

39:48.600 --> 39:51.800
Please know
that wherever you go,

39:51.870 --> 39:54.240
you will always
have a place here.

39:56.470 --> 39:57.570
Thank you.

40:02.880 --> 40:05.580
- Take care of yourself.
- You too.

40:07.890 --> 40:09.520
Don't be a prisoner.

40:28.840 --> 40:31.240
<i>Oh, Flynn!</i>

40:31.310 --> 40:32.910
Flynn?

40:32.980 --> 40:34.380
Jenkins.
Have you seen Flynn?

40:34.450 --> 40:36.310
We are finally
gonna go bowling...

40:37.920 --> 40:39.250
You all right, Jenkins?

40:48.660 --> 40:50.660
Flynn's tethering ring.

40:50.730 --> 40:56.600
Yes. He took all of
his things. Left this.

40:56.670 --> 40:58.730
I have a feeling that he's gone

40:58.800 --> 41:01.300
to look for something
that he couldn't find here.

41:03.670 --> 41:05.610
What does this mean?

41:05.610 --> 41:07.810
I believe it means
that Mr. Carsen

41:07.880 --> 41:09.650
has resigned from the Library.

41:13.880 --> 41:15.580
And that he will not
be coming back.
