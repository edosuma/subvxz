09:33.322 --> 09:35.199
I THINK SHE SAID
SOMETHING ABOUT ISABELLE
HAVING ELECTIVE FOOT SURGERY.

09:35.283 --> 09:36.784
PFFT. I SEE.

09:36.867 --> 09:37.827
YOU READY FOR LUNCH?

09:37.910 --> 09:38.828
YEAH. YOU GOT AN UMBRELLA.

09:38.911 --> 09:39.829
IT'S TRYING TO RAIN
OUT THERE.

09:39.912 --> 09:41.080
NO. I'M ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.

09:41.122 --> 09:43.124
HEY, GOOD TO MEET YOU,
FELLAS.

09:43.207 --> 09:45.668
OH, UH, PUT AN OINTMENT
ON THAT SKIN BURN

09:45.751 --> 09:47.878
YOU'RE GONNA GET
FROM THE RUBBIN'.

09:47.962 --> 09:50.631
SISTER HUNG UP
IN MY EAR.

09:50.673 --> 09:53.634
SISTER'S HYSTERICAL.
SHE HANGS UP ON ME
ALL THE TIME.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.335
MISS SUAREZ.
MISS SUAREZ.

11:09.418 --> 11:12.129
WE ARE COLLEAGUES
OF THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY,

11:12.171 --> 11:15.591
AND WE KNOW THAT YOUR SISTER
IS NOT IN THE HOSPITAL.

11:15.633 --> 11:17.468
WE'D JUST LIKE TO GET SOME
BACKGROUND INFORMATION

11:17.551 --> 11:20.304
SO THAT WE CAN INVESTIGATE
WHAT HAPPENED TO HER.

11:20.388 --> 11:22.682
TALK TO THIS WOMAN, COHEN.
IT'S THE D.O.A.'s SISTER,

11:22.765 --> 11:24.975
AND SIMONE CAN'T GET HER OFF
YOUR COVER STORY.

11:25.017 --> 11:26.102
THE COVER STORY
DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE.

11:26.143 --> 11:27.144
DeCARLO FOUND OUT
SHE'S DEAD.

11:27.186 --> 11:28.229
EXCUSE ME.

11:28.312 --> 11:30.648
I'LL CALL YOU BACK
IN 10 MINUTES

11:30.690 --> 11:32.441
OR A.D.A. COHEN
WILL.

11:32.483 --> 11:33.818
HOW DID THAT
COME OUT?

11:33.901 --> 11:35.820
HOW'S THIS FOR CLASSIC
DEFENSE LAWYER BEHAVIOR?

11:35.861 --> 11:38.823
DeCARLO'S PARTNER MONITORED
THE AMBULANCE CALLS.

11:38.906 --> 11:41.158
AND DeCARLO FOUND THIS OUT
FROM HIS LAW PARTNER HOW?

11:41.242 --> 11:43.828
HIS PARTNER BEEPED HIM
WHILE WE WERE AT LUNCH.

11:45.162 --> 11:48.624
THAT'S 3 HOURS AFTER
THE AMBULANCE CALL.

11:48.666 --> 11:51.252
HE'D BEEN TRYIN' A CASE
ALL MORNING, DeCARLO'S PARTNER.

11:51.335 --> 11:53.713
SO HE MONITORED
THE AMBULANCE CALL

11:53.796 --> 11:54.964
WHILE HE WAS
TRYING A CASE?

11:55.005 --> 11:56.257
WHAT, HE HAVE LITTLE
HEADPHONES ON IN COURT?

11:56.340 --> 11:58.134
LOOK, WHAT IS YOUR POINT?

11:58.175 --> 12:01.679
LEO...THE PARTNER
WOULD'VE HAD TO MONITOR
THE AMBULANCE CALL

12:01.762 --> 12:02.972
BEFORE HE
WENT INTO COURT

12:03.013 --> 12:05.015
AND KNOWING
THAT THIS WOMAN
BEING MURDERED

12:05.057 --> 12:07.017
MEANS DeCARLO DON'T HAVE
TO PLEAD THE CLIENT OUT,

12:07.101 --> 12:08.519
HE'S NOT GONNA THINK
TO BEEP TILL LUNCH?

12:08.602 --> 12:12.773
SUPPOSE
THE PARTNER MONITORING
THE RADIO CALL'S BOGUS.

12:12.857 --> 12:15.109
SUPPOSE THAT AIN'T HOW
THEY KNOW THE WOMAN'S DEAD.

12:15.192 --> 12:16.861
HOW DO THEY KNOW?

12:16.944 --> 12:19.613
SUPPOSE THEY'RE
FRONTIN' FOR THE CLIENT.

12:19.697 --> 12:21.198
WHO HAD HER KILLED.

12:22.199 --> 12:23.993
I CAN'T IMAGINE
WALLY DeCARLO

12:24.034 --> 12:26.370
HAVING ANYTHING LIKE
THAT KIND OF MIND.

12:26.412 --> 12:29.331
THAT'S HOW COLUMBO
GOT OVER ALL THEM YEARS.

12:36.172 --> 12:37.840
OH, MY GOD.

12:37.882 --> 12:39.842
AND SHE ASKED ME
FOR PROTECTION.

12:39.884 --> 12:41.135
WHEN WAS THIS?

12:41.218 --> 12:42.678
SHE CALLED AND ASKED ME
FOR PROTECTION

12:42.720 --> 12:44.221
AFTER THERE WERE THOSE
ATTEMPTED BREAK-INS
IN HER BUILDING.

12:44.305 --> 12:45.473
THE DAY HE'S
TALKIN' ABOUT,

12:45.556 --> 12:48.267
THERE'S A PRETTY GOOD
DESCRIPTION ON 2 GUYS

12:48.350 --> 12:50.060
THAT GOT QUESTIONED
A BLOCK AND 1/2 DOWN.

12:50.144 --> 12:52.897
THEY TRIED TO JIMMY THE DOORS
ON 2 OTHER APARTMENTS AS WELL.

12:52.980 --> 12:54.690
I--I JUST COULDN'T IMAGINE
IT WAS RELATED

12:54.732 --> 12:56.734
TO HER BEING A WITNESS
IN MY CASE.

12:56.817 --> 12:57.985
THERE'S NO POINT
BEATIN' YOURSELF
UP NOW.

12:58.068 --> 13:00.321
I GUESS IF THEY'D FAKE
A PLEA NEGOTIATION,

13:00.404 --> 13:02.740
THEY'D BE CAPABLE
OF THAT KIND OF MISDIRECT.

13:02.782 --> 13:04.116
AND IF THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED,

13:04.200 --> 13:06.577
I'M GOING AFTER CARNEY,
WHO HAD THIS WOMAN KILLED,

13:06.619 --> 13:08.204
AND THAT SON OF A BITCH
DeCARLO!

13:08.245 --> 13:09.830
IF THEY ARE
THAT CLEVER, COHEN,

13:09.914 --> 13:11.707
YOU DON'T WANNA LET 'EM KNOW
THAT YOU SMELLED A RAT.

13:11.749 --> 13:12.958
LET US SEE
IF WE CAN TRACK DOWN

13:13.042 --> 13:14.710
THESE 2 SKELS OFF
THE STOP AND FRISK CARD.

13:14.752 --> 13:17.755
THIS WAY,
WHEN YOU DO GO AT 'EM
WITH YOUR VOW OF VENGEANCE,

13:17.838 --> 13:20.174
YOU'LL HAVE SOMETHING
BESIDES YOUR FINGER TO WAG.

13:20.257 --> 13:21.967
LEO, COULD YOU CALL
THE SISTER, PLEASE?

13:22.051 --> 13:23.469
TELL HER
THE COVER STORY'S OFF.

13:23.552 --> 13:25.846
YEAH, I'LL CALL
THE SISTER.

13:27.681 --> 13:30.059
SO YOU WERE LOOKIN'
FOR CHLOE, TOO?

13:30.100 --> 13:31.936
HER FATHER AND THE COP
WERE LOOKING.

13:32.019 --> 13:33.646
I BECAME AWARE
THAT SHE WAS MISSING.

13:33.729 --> 13:36.899
I HAD NO OTHER
DEMANDS ON MY TIME.

13:36.941 --> 13:39.777
I'M SURE YOU UNDERSTAND, CY,
WITH THIS GIRL MISSING

13:39.819 --> 13:42.363
AND YOU SPENDING
A LOT OF TIME WITH HER,

13:42.446 --> 13:44.490
WE WANNA KNOW WHY THAT IS.

13:44.573 --> 13:46.200
I SPEND TIME WITH HER

13:46.283 --> 13:48.118
BECAUSE I WANNA
SPEND TIME WITH HER.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.955
AND I DON'T GOTTA
DEFEND MYSELF TO YOU
OR ANYBODY ELSE.

13:51.038 --> 13:53.207
YOU EVER SPEND TIME WITH HER
OUTSIDE THE PARK?

13:53.290 --> 13:54.625
NO, I HAVE NOT.

13:54.959 --> 13:56.961
SOMEONE TELLS US
DIFFERENT.

13:57.002 --> 13:58.671
YOU'RE IN
A WORLD OF TROUBLE.

13:58.754 --> 14:00.840
LOOK, MISS,
I KNOW WHAT I DID.

14:00.923 --> 14:02.174
I KNOW WHAT
I DIDN'T DO.

14:02.258 --> 14:04.510
WILL YOU STOP TRYING
TO SCARE ME?

14:04.593 --> 14:07.137
WE'RE NOT TRYING
TO SCARE YOU.

14:07.179 --> 14:08.806
WE'RE TRYING TO FIND
A 9-YEAR-OLD GIRL.

14:08.848 --> 14:12.142
THE FACT THAT A MAN YOUR AGE
HAS BEEN SEEN REPEATEDLY
TALKING TO HER

14:12.226 --> 14:14.520
REQUIRES WE TAKE
AN INTEREST.

14:16.397 --> 14:18.274
SHE'S GOT A HARD LIFE,

14:18.357 --> 14:20.359
HER AND HER FATHER,

14:20.442 --> 14:23.195
AND THAT'S WHY I TRY
TO MAKE IT EASIER.

14:23.279 --> 14:26.740
WINTERTIME,
I BOUGHT HER A COAT.

14:26.782 --> 14:28.158
SUMMERTIME...

14:31.078 --> 14:33.789
I BOUGHT HER...
BIG STRAW HAT.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.833
WHAT DID YOU ASK
IN RETURN?

14:35.916 --> 14:37.459
NOTHING.

14:37.501 --> 14:40.254
I TAUGHT HER THE WORDS
TO MARES EAT OATS

14:40.337 --> 14:43.799
BECAUSE I WANTED
TO HEAR HER SING THAT.

14:45.050 --> 14:47.553
I DIDN'T FORCE HER
TO SING IT.

14:47.636 --> 14:51.056
SHE COULD'VE SANG
ANYTHING SHE WANTED.

14:52.308 --> 14:55.895
I TELL HER,
"THE WHOLE WORLD
IS NOT YOUR FRIEND.

14:55.936 --> 14:58.022
YOU SHOULDN'T BE
TALKING TO STRANGERS."

14:58.063 --> 15:00.274
SHE SAYS...

15:00.357 --> 15:03.569
"THEN I NEVER
WOULD HAVE MET YOU."

15:05.821 --> 15:07.698
NOW THEY GOT HER.

15:08.282 --> 15:11.577
YOU KNOW A GUY THEY,
UH, CALL "TEACHER"?

15:11.619 --> 15:13.787
IS HE THE BASTARD?

15:13.829 --> 15:14.997
YOU KNOW WHERE
WE CAN FIND HIM?

15:15.080 --> 15:18.792
OH, YEAH. I DON'T
HAVE TO DO WITH HIM,

15:18.876 --> 15:21.086
BUT I AM FAMILIAR
WITH HIS ROUTINE.

15:45.277 --> 15:46.695
YOU EVER, UH...

15:46.779 --> 15:49.531
DONE A HOMICIDE,
ARNEL?

15:51.200 --> 15:53.494
HELL NO.

15:53.535 --> 15:54.536
NO?

15:56.038 --> 15:58.624
ALL RIGHT, LOOK. WHY DON'T YOU
TELL ME WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT?

15:58.707 --> 16:02.002
YOU EVER SHOOT A CHILD
IN THE HEAD?

16:02.920 --> 16:05.714
MAN, I AIN'T
NOTHIN' LIKE THAT.

16:05.756 --> 16:08.133
YOU ARE GONNA WISH THAT
YOU WERE DEAD AND BURIED

16:08.217 --> 16:10.511
IF THAT TURNS OUT
NOT TRUE.

16:10.552 --> 16:14.390
OK, I SHOT ONE PERSON,
IN THE ARM,

16:14.431 --> 16:18.727
AND IT WAS MY COUSIN
FOR STEALING MY BIKE.

16:18.811 --> 16:23.565
SO THIS HOME INVASION
WHERE A WOMAN AND HER CHILD
WERE MURDERED THIS MORNING,

16:23.607 --> 16:24.650
SHOT IN THE HEAD--

16:24.733 --> 16:25.859
THAT'S THE SAME BUILDING

16:25.943 --> 16:27.319
THAT YOU AND YOUR
ASSHOLE BUDDY ROGER

16:27.403 --> 16:29.321
BROKE INTO 2 WEEKS AGO.

16:29.405 --> 16:30.823
YEAH, BUT WE DIDN'T
GET COLLARED FOR THAT!

16:30.906 --> 16:32.658
YOU GONNA SAY YOU DIDN'T
TRY AND BREAK IN?

16:32.741 --> 16:35.119
OK, OK, OK.
JUST WAIT.

16:35.160 --> 16:37.204
WE JIMMIED SOME DOORS,

16:37.287 --> 16:38.539
BUT WE DIDN'T
DO NOTHIN' TODAY.

16:38.622 --> 16:39.999
YOU ARE LYIN',

16:40.082 --> 16:42.793
AND THAT MEANS
THAT YOU SHOT THAT
MOTHER AND HER CHILD.

16:42.876 --> 16:45.337
WE DIDN'T!
WE WASN'T THERE TODAY!

16:45.421 --> 16:46.463
HE FEELS LIKE
YOU'RE LYIN'.

16:46.505 --> 16:49.091
WE WERE NOT SUPPOSED
TO BREAK IN, OK?

16:49.133 --> 16:50.551
WE DID WHAT WE WERE
SUPPOSED TO DO.

16:50.634 --> 16:51.468
YOU TALKIN' ABOUT TODAY?

16:51.510 --> 16:54.680
I'M TALKIN' ABOUT
2 WEEKS AGO.

16:57.224 --> 17:01.311
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO JUST
MESS WITH THEM DOORS.

17:01.353 --> 17:04.314
ROGER WILL KNOW WHICH ONES.

17:09.236 --> 17:11.238
THANKS, JOSH.

17:11.321 --> 17:12.990
HE WANTS
A CIGARETTE.

17:13.073 --> 17:14.658
MAN, I'D KILL
FOR A NEWPORT.

17:14.700 --> 17:18.620
SO NOW WE KNOW YOUR
ASKING PRICE. SIT DOWN.

17:18.704 --> 17:21.498
SO WHAT IS YOUR NAME,
ROGER OR VAN EARL?

17:21.582 --> 17:25.169
IT'S--IT'S VAN EARL, MAN.

17:25.252 --> 17:26.962
YOU AND ARNEL GOT HIRED
TO JIMMY SOME DOORS

17:27.046 --> 17:29.048
IN A BUILDING
ON 12th STREET
10 DAYS AGO,

17:29.131 --> 17:30.966
MAKE IT LOOK LIKE
YOU WERE TRYING
TO BREAK IN.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.594
WELL, SEE,
NOW YOU'RE GETTIN'
INTO A STRANGE AREA.

17:33.635 --> 17:36.138
VAN EARL, WHAT COMES
OUTTA YOUR MOUTH NEXT

17:36.221 --> 17:38.807
IS EITHER THE NAME OF
THE GUY THAT HIRED YOU
OR TEETH.

17:38.891 --> 17:42.102
WELL, SEE, THIS IS
WHERE IT'S STRANGE.

17:42.144 --> 17:44.688
YOU KNOW,
I COULDN'T TELL YOU
FOR LOVE OR MONEY

17:44.772 --> 17:47.274
WHO THAT GENTLEMAN WAS
WHO HIRED US

17:47.316 --> 17:48.942
TO MESS WITH
THOSE APARTMENTS, MAN.

17:48.984 --> 17:51.445
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW
WHERE HE CAME FROM

17:51.487 --> 17:53.197
NOR HOW HE KNEW ME.

17:53.280 --> 17:54.281
HIT HIM.

17:54.323 --> 17:56.283
HOW DID HE GET
IN TOUCH WITH YOU?!

17:56.325 --> 17:57.993
PHYSICALLY OR--

17:58.077 --> 18:02.539
WELL, EVIDENTLY,
HE KNEW THE CORNER
I FREQUENT, YA KNOW?

18:02.623 --> 18:06.418
HE APPROACHED ME.
HE TOOK ME FOR A CUP
OF COFFEE.

18:06.502 --> 18:07.878
HE--HE--

18:07.961 --> 18:10.422
HE BROACHED THE SUBJECT
OF THESE APARTMENTS.

18:10.506 --> 18:14.510
HE SAID FOOL AROUND
WITH THE LOCKS ON 2-B,
AND, YA KNOW,

18:14.593 --> 18:16.929
ANY OTHER COUPLE
OF APARTMENTS

18:17.012 --> 18:19.681
I AND THE ACCOMPLICE
OF MY CHOICE WANTED.

18:19.765 --> 18:21.517
BUT YOU HAD
TO FOOL WITH 2-B?

18:21.600 --> 18:24.019
YEAH. THOSE--THOSE WERE
HIS INSTRUCTIONS, YA KNOW?

18:24.061 --> 18:29.650
THEN HE GAVE ME $200,
AND...HE STOOD UP AND LEFT

18:29.691 --> 18:33.487
AS IF...FROM
ANOTHER DIMENSION.

18:33.529 --> 18:37.491
HEY, HEY! YOU CAN BEAT ME
TILL NEXT WEEK, MAN,

18:37.533 --> 18:41.411
BUT I CAN NEVER FATHOM
WHERE THIS GUY CAME FROM.

18:41.495 --> 18:43.205
SO THIS CRIMINAL
POSSESSION COLLAR

18:43.247 --> 18:46.166
ON YOUR RAP SHEET
FROM 3 MONTHS AGO,
VAN EARL,

18:46.208 --> 18:48.836
WHO WAS YOUR LAWYER
ON THAT?

18:48.877 --> 18:52.422
OH...MAN...I'M SO FAR GONE
IN SUBSTANCE ABUSE,

18:52.506 --> 18:54.133
I--I CAN'T REMEMBER THAT.

18:54.216 --> 18:56.051
WHAT DID HE LOOK LIKE?

18:58.011 --> 19:04.560
WELL...HE HAD THIS VERY...
VERY WEAK CHIN, YA KNOW?

19:04.643 --> 19:07.855
AND A SURPRISINGLY
SLOPPY SUIT
FOR AN ATTORNEY.

19:07.896 --> 19:10.399
WALLY DeCARLO?

19:10.482 --> 19:15.737
WOW. THAT--THAT IS
SO X-FILES, MAN.

19:15.821 --> 19:18.115
HEY, YOU THINK THERE'S
SOME KIND OF CONNECTION

19:18.198 --> 19:21.785
BETWEEN HIM AND
THAT MYSTERY PERSON

19:21.869 --> 19:24.580
THAT APPROACHED ME
ABOUT JIMMYING THE DOORS?

19:24.621 --> 19:26.582
YOU THINK THAT
THIS MYSTERY PERSON

19:26.665 --> 19:31.295
IS SOME MYSTERIOUS EMISSARY
FROM MY FORMER LAWYER?

19:35.007 --> 19:36.258
NEWPORTS?

19:36.300 --> 19:37.759
OH, YEAH...MAN.

19:37.843 --> 19:38.844
THANKS.

19:45.851 --> 19:48.145
OBVIOUSLY
THIS SCUMMER LAWYER
KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON

19:48.228 --> 19:50.105
INSTEAD OF JUST BEING
A DUPE FOR THIS GUY
THAT'S LOCKED UP.

19:50.147 --> 19:53.442
IT'S NOT ENOUGH
TO GO AT HIM WITH, YET.

19:53.525 --> 19:54.943
COHEN'S NOT CAREFUL,

19:55.027 --> 19:58.155
WE'LL GIVE HIM SOMETHING
TO WAG HIS FINGER ABOUT.

20:04.411 --> 20:05.913
WHEN THIS IS RESOLVED,

20:05.996 --> 20:09.791
I WANT YOU BOTH TO COME BACK
TO EISENBERG'S COFFEE SHOP

20:09.875 --> 20:12.294
AND TO EXPLAIN TO THE STAFF
AND THE CUSTOMERS

20:12.377 --> 20:15.255
THAT I HAVE BEEN DETAINED
AND QUESTIONED IN ERROR.

20:29.645 --> 20:31.396
YOU WILL EITHER COMPLY
WITH MY REQUEST,

20:31.480 --> 20:33.941
OR I WILL PURSUE MY LEGAL
REMEDIES VERY VOLUBLY.

20:34.024 --> 20:38.028
LOUIS...THEY SAY YOUR
STREET NAME IS TEACHER.

20:38.111 --> 20:41.490
WHICH DO YOU LIKE
TO BE CALLED?

20:41.531 --> 20:43.200
I WANT YOU TO CALL ME
MR. SIMKISS.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.244
HEY, YOU NEED
TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING.

20:45.327 --> 20:47.871
YOU'RE MENTIONED
AS POSSIBLY CONNECTED
WITH THE DISAPPEARANCE

20:47.913 --> 20:49.289
OF A 9-YEAR-OLD CHILD.

20:49.373 --> 20:51.124
THAT IS SCURRILOUS
AND UNTRUE.

20:51.208 --> 20:52.709
NOW, IF YOU
WEREN'T INVOLVED,

20:52.793 --> 20:55.170
MY PARTNER AND I WILL
BE GLAD TO APOLOGIZE
IN THAT RESTAURANT.

20:55.212 --> 20:58.548
RIGHT NOW...
WE DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ANY MORE ABOUT IT.

20:58.632 --> 21:00.676
YOU NEED TO ANSWER
THE QUESTIONS WE ASK YOU

21:00.717 --> 21:02.052
IN A WAY WE THINK
IS TRUTHFUL,

21:02.094 --> 21:04.012
OR YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
A LOT MORE PROBLEMS

21:04.054 --> 21:05.889
THAN WHAT PEOPLE
THINK ABOUT YOU
IN THAT COFFEE SHOP.

21:05.973 --> 21:07.391
WHAT YOU THINK
IS TRUTHFUL.

21:07.474 --> 21:09.226
SO NOT ONLY
DO YOU DETAIN ME,

21:09.309 --> 21:10.644
YOU SERVE AS
MY JUDGE AND JURY.

21:10.727 --> 21:12.229
YOU KNOW WHAT, LOUIS?

21:12.271 --> 21:14.398
I GET THE FEELING
BEING SMART HASN'T
HELPED YOU MUCH IN LIFE.

21:14.439 --> 21:17.693
THE MORE YOU RUN YOUR MOUTH,
DON'T LET US FIND OUT
WHAT WE NEED TO,

21:17.734 --> 21:20.279
THE HARDER WE LOOK AT YOU
FOR GRABBING THAT GIRL.

21:20.362 --> 21:22.281
I HAD NOTHING TO DO
WITH CHLOE'S
BEING MISSING.

21:22.364 --> 21:24.199
AND I RESENT YOUR FACILE
SUMMARIZINGS!

21:24.241 --> 21:28.495
I HAVE BEEN AN INSTRUCTOR
AT NEW YORK UNIVERSITY
AND AT HUNTER COLLEGE.

21:28.578 --> 21:31.373
TELL US ABOUT CHLOE!

21:33.417 --> 21:37.754
CHLOE IS A BRIGHT,
SWEET-SPIRITED CHILD

21:37.838 --> 21:39.715
WHOSE SINGING ABILITY
HER FATHER EXPLOITS

21:39.756 --> 21:42.259
TO THE DETRIMENT OF
HER OVERALL DEVELOPMENT.

21:42.342 --> 21:44.094
YOU FEEL
HE EXPLOITS HER,
PERIOD.

21:44.177 --> 21:46.430
I AM NOT A CONFRONTATIONAL
PERSON,

21:46.471 --> 21:48.849
OR I WOULD HAVE
TOLD HIM AS MUCH.

21:50.100 --> 21:53.103
I BELIEVE CHILD WELFARE
HAS BEEN CONTACTED.

21:53.186 --> 21:54.521
DO YOU KNOW
WHO CALLED THEM?

21:54.563 --> 21:57.941
I BELIEVE THOSE CONTACTS
ARE MADE ANONYMOUSLY.

21:59.609 --> 22:00.777
EVER BEEN
IN THE HOSPITAL?

22:03.113 --> 22:05.907
I--I HAVE BEEN HOSPITALIZED
FOR DEPRESSION.

22:05.991 --> 22:11.538
I AM TAKING 20 MILLIGRAMS OF
PROZAC A DAY...FAITHFULLY.

22:11.621 --> 22:14.499
SO YOU'RE PRESENTLY
UNDER PSYCHIATRIC CARE.

22:14.541 --> 22:17.502
DO YOU WANT TO TALK
TO MY PSYCHIATRIST?

22:17.544 --> 22:20.505
I WILL GIVE HIM FULL PERMISSION
TO TALK TO YOU.

22:20.589 --> 22:21.965
YES,
WE'D APPRECIATE THAT.

22:22.049 --> 22:24.176
FINE! FINE!
AND BE SURE TO ASK HIM

22:24.259 --> 22:27.346
IF--IF--IF HE THINKS
THAT I AM A PEDOPHILE.

22:28.889 --> 22:31.850
AND HE WILL TELL YOU
THAT I AM NOT.

22:31.892 --> 22:33.977
AND YOU BE SURE
TO ASK HIM

22:34.019 --> 22:38.023
WHY I AM SUCH A FAILURE
IN LIFE, EVEN WITH A Ph.D.

22:57.292 --> 23:00.170
YOUR DOCTOR
JUST COME IN, ANDY.

23:00.253 --> 23:01.880
WHERE?

23:01.963 --> 23:05.509
HE SAID HE WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU IN PRIVATE.
I SENT HIM TO THE POKY.

23:05.550 --> 23:08.220
YEAH. OK. THANKS.

23:08.303 --> 23:09.221
GOOD NIGHT, GUYS.

23:09.304 --> 23:11.098
GOOD NIGHT, BOB.

23:15.310 --> 23:18.021
MAYBE HE JUST NEEDS
A TICKET FIXED.

23:26.113 --> 23:27.864
HEY, ANDY.

23:31.368 --> 23:33.537
HOW DID MY SCORES
COME OUT?

23:33.578 --> 23:35.497
YOUR PSA SCORE
IS ESSENTIALLY ZERO.

23:35.539 --> 23:37.791
YOU COULDN'T HAVE
ANY BETTER NEWS.

23:37.874 --> 23:39.876
IS THAT SO?

23:39.960 --> 23:43.547
I'LL SEE YOU IN 3 MONTHS,
I'LL CHECK YOU OUT,

23:43.630 --> 23:46.758
BUT I WANT YOU
TO THINK OF YOURSELF
AS A HEALTHY PERSON.

23:46.842 --> 23:47.801
GOOD.

23:47.884 --> 23:49.803
IT'S NOT LIKE SNAPPING
YOUR FINGERS,

23:49.886 --> 23:52.514
AND, WE KNOW, YOU'VE GOT
SOME THINGS TO ADJUST TO.

23:52.556 --> 23:53.890
OH, YEAH.

23:53.974 --> 23:56.518
HOW'S YOUR URINARY CONTROL?

23:56.560 --> 23:58.019
BETTER. THANKS.

23:59.563 --> 24:01.398
HAVE YOU AND SYLVIA
TRIED HAVING SEX?

24:01.481 --> 24:03.900
UH...UH...

24:03.942 --> 24:08.530
THAT WHOLE SEX THING,
IT SEEMS LIKE
A FOREGONE CONCLUSION.

24:10.699 --> 24:12.242
I'M NOT SURE I FOLLOW.

24:12.325 --> 24:14.786
IT--IT SEEMS, UH...

24:14.870 --> 24:16.621
FORGONE.

24:16.705 --> 24:19.291
SO YOU HAVEN'T TRIED
MAKING LOVE WITH SYLVIA.

24:19.374 --> 24:20.417
I HAVE THE THOUGHTS.

24:20.500 --> 24:22.252
THEY JUST DON'T
TRANSLATE THEMSELVES,

24:22.335 --> 24:23.336
SO I DON'T WANNA
HUMILIATE US.

24:23.420 --> 24:25.964
YOU DON'T GET AN ERECTION.

24:27.257 --> 24:29.593
THERE'S EXCELLENT
NEW MEDICATION NOW, ANDY,

24:29.676 --> 24:30.552
FOR MEN WHO'VE HAD
YOUR PROCEDURE.

24:30.594 --> 24:31.595
HOW HUMILIATING?

24:31.678 --> 24:33.680
IT'S A PILL.

24:35.390 --> 24:36.308
A PILL?

24:36.391 --> 24:38.226
A PILL, LIKE ASPIRIN.

24:39.978 --> 24:42.814
WELL...THAT DON'T
SOUND TOO BAD.

24:42.898 --> 24:45.567
WHY DON'T I WRITE YOU
A PRESCRIPTION.

24:45.609 --> 24:46.776
UH, FINE.

24:51.573 --> 24:54.117
I SURE APPRECIATE YOU
TAKING ALL THE INTEREST.

24:59.164 --> 25:00.415
MY PLEASURE.

25:25.315 --> 25:26.483
ANDY.

25:26.566 --> 25:29.110
AHEM. YOU THINK THERE'S
A GENERAL DISRUPTION

25:29.152 --> 25:32.113
OF WEATHER PATTERNS
WITH THIS GLOBAL WARMING?

25:32.155 --> 25:33.949
NO.

25:35.408 --> 25:38.328
ARE YOU APPLYING
FOR A LOAN?

25:38.370 --> 25:39.329
WHAT?

25:40.705 --> 25:42.249
I WEAR THIS SUIT
ALL THE TIME.

25:42.332 --> 25:43.833
NAH.

25:43.875 --> 25:45.126

25:46.378 --> 25:48.797
THE SHIRT, DETECTIVE.

25:48.880 --> 25:50.882
OH, THAT'S IT.

25:56.054 --> 25:58.265

DIANE AND ME,

25:58.348 --> 26:01.017

DURING LUNCH.

26:04.813 --> 26:06.356
CONGRATULATIONS.
THANKS.

26:06.398 --> 26:08.608
AS FAR AS ME NOT SAYING
ANYTHING BEFORE,

26:08.692 --> 26:11.987
I FIGURED THE LESS I SAID,
THE LESS I MIGHT HAVE
TO TAKE BACK.

26:12.070 --> 26:15.657
IT WAS NEVER

30:43.883 --> 30:45.468
THAT KILLED THAT MOTHER
AND CHILD,

30:45.510 --> 30:46.845
'CAUSE, SEE, THAT WOULD
TEND TO MAKE RAZOR THINK

30:46.886 --> 30:48.847

SEPARATE NEGOTIATIONS.

30:48.888 --> 30:50.306

31:33.266 --> 31:35.518
5-YEAR-OLD BOY
AND HIS MOTHER, CHRIS.

31:35.602 --> 31:37.520
LOOK, THE ONLY REASON
I WOULD DO WHAT I DID--

31:37.604 --> 31:38.605

31:39.647 --> 31:40.648
AND WHO HIRED YOU?

31:40.732 --> 31:42.442
I WAS COMIN' OUT

31:42.525 --> 31:44.402
AND I GOT HIRED
BY RAZOR GADDISON.

31:44.444 --> 31:46.154
DID HE SAY WHO GAVE
HIM THE CONTRACT?

31:46.237 --> 31:49.282
SOME OTHER GUY INSIDE
ABOUT TO GO ON TRIAL
FOR A JEWELRY STORE HEIST,

31:49.365 --> 31:50.366
AND THE WOMAN
WAS A WITNESS.

31:50.450 --> 31:52.035
AND WHY DID YOU
KILL THAT CHILD?

31:52.118 --> 31:53.036
HE SAW ME.

31:53.119 --> 31:54.037
ARE YOU SURE
HE SAW YOU, CHRIS?

31:54.120 --> 31:55.496
HIS MOTHER HAD HIM
BEHIND HER.

31:55.580 --> 31:57.290
HEY, MAN, LOOK,
I NEEDED MONEY
FOR MEXICO, MAN.

31:57.373 --> 31:58.958
MY LIVER'S SHOT,

31:59.000 --> 32:00.960
AND THEY DON'T LET I.V.
USERS IN THE TREATMENT
PROGRAM HERE, MAN.

32:01.002 --> 32:03.504
IT'S THE ONLY REASON
I'D DO SOMETHING
LIKE THAT, MAN!

32:03.588 --> 32:05.798
ARE YOU SURE
HE SAW YOU, CHRIS?

32:07.759 --> 32:10.303
I...I COULDN'T RISK IT.

32:10.386 --> 32:11.638
AS SOON AS I
LET YOU GO,

32:11.679 --> 32:13.723
YOU ARE GONNA WRITE
ALL OF THIS DOWN,
CHRIS,

32:13.806 --> 32:16.476
OR I'M GONNA PUNCH
YOU RIGHT WHERE
YOUR LIVER'S SHOT.

32:16.559 --> 32:18.436
I WILL. I WILL.

32:32.909 --> 32:35.662
ASSHOLE WHO DID OUR DOUBLE
IS GIVING A STATEMENT.

32:35.745 --> 32:37.330
GOOD.

32:37.413 --> 32:40.208
WE'RE GONNA NEED COHEN
TO REACH OUT TO THAT
PRICK LAWYER FOR US

32:40.291 --> 32:43.378
BEFORE IT GETS OUT
THAT THIS ONE GAVE IT UP.

32:43.461 --> 32:44.462
HI.

32:44.504 --> 32:45.505
HI, BOSS.

32:47.924 --> 32:49.342

MISSING LITTLE GIRL.

32:50.843 --> 32:51.803
HOW DO YOU DO?

32:51.844 --> 32:53.012
YEAH.
HOW DO YOU DO?

32:53.096 --> 32:54.722
SHOULD WE TALK TO HIM
IN THE COFFEE ROOM?

32:54.806 --> 32:58.518
ACTUALLY, I WONDER
IF I COULD USE THE
LITTLE BOYS' ROOM.

32:59.811 --> 33:01.771
COME ON.

33:02.772 --> 33:03.690
NATURE CALLS.

33:03.773 --> 33:04.816
YEAH, HUH?

33:10.029 --> 33:11.030
REGISTERED PEDOPHILE.

33:11.114 --> 33:13.199
WORKS AT A VIDEO STORE
3 BLOCKS FROM THE PARK

33:13.241 --> 33:14.659
WHERE THE GIRL
AND HER FATHER SANG.

33:14.701 --> 33:15.868
TALK TO HIM
IN THE POKEY.

33:15.952 --> 33:17.078
I WANT TO WATCH
THE INTERVIEW.

33:17.161 --> 33:18.454
CAN YOU MOVE YOUR GUY?

33:18.538 --> 33:21.374
YEAH. I'LL GET ANDY
TO MOVE HIM INTO 3.

33:21.416 --> 33:24.711
AND SHALL I CALL?

33:24.752 --> 33:25.712
YEAH, PLEASE.

33:25.753 --> 33:28.423
EXCUSE ME
A SECOND, BOSS.

33:32.176 --> 33:34.178
THERE'S NO LAW SAYS
WE CAN'T DO IT FIRST
THING TOMORROW.

33:34.220 --> 33:35.430
ABSOLUTELY.

33:37.432 --> 33:40.018
CITY HALL'S BEEN UP
A LONG TIME.

33:44.564 --> 33:46.149
I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU
HAVE TO DO THIS.

33:46.190 --> 33:47.525
UH-HUH.

33:47.567 --> 33:49.986
I WISH IN THE PAST I HADN'T
HAD MY FORMER PROBLEMS,

33:50.028 --> 33:51.320
BUT I KNOW
I CAN'T CHANGE THAT.

33:51.362 --> 33:53.531
SHUT YOUR MOUTH,
OK, TODD?

33:53.573 --> 33:54.532
I UNDERSTAND.

33:54.615 --> 33:58.036
ACCOUNT FOR
YOUR LAST 48 HOURS.

33:58.077 --> 34:01.497
WORKED MONDAY,
8 A.M. TO 6:30 P.M.
AT THE VIDEO STORE.

34:01.539 --> 34:05.209
HAD A SPROUT, AVOCADO,
AND TUNA SANDWICH ON PITA

34:05.293 --> 34:07.378
AT HEALTHY OUTLOOK
AT 7:15 AFTER WORK--

34:07.462 --> 34:08.755
ARE YOU BEING SMART?

34:08.796 --> 34:10.256
NO. I SWEAR I'M NOT.

34:10.423 --> 34:11.466
UH, I WENT HOME--

34:11.507 --> 34:12.467
ALONE?

34:12.508 --> 34:13.676
ALONE, YES.

34:13.760 --> 34:15.511
WATCHED A VIDEO OF
THE FIFTH ELEMENT,

34:15.595 --> 34:17.722
WATCHED
POLITICALLY INCORRECT
ON COMMERCIAL TELEVISION--

34:17.805 --> 34:19.474
GO THROUGH
YOUR DAY YESTERDAY.

34:21.017 --> 34:22.310
WENT TO WORK AT 8:30--

34:22.351 --> 34:24.479
YOU OPEN THE STORE?

34:24.562 --> 34:26.105
MR. EPSTEIN'S
BEEN KIND ENOUGH

34:26.147 --> 34:28.649
TO HAVE A GROWING CONFIDENCE
IN MY MANAGERIAL ABILITIES

34:28.733 --> 34:30.318
THAT HE ALLOWS ME
NOT TO DO THAT.

34:30.401 --> 34:31.652
DID YOU WALK
TO WORK YESTERDAY?

34:31.944 --> 34:34.655
I THOUGHT ABOUT NOT
BECAUSE IT WAS
WANTING TO RAIN,

34:34.739 --> 34:36.532
BUT MY GAMBLE WORKED OUT.

34:36.574 --> 34:38.785
YOU'RE GONNA GET HURT
IF YOU DON'T START
ANSWERING YES OR NO.

34:38.868 --> 34:41.788
YES. YES. YESTERDAY
I WALKED TO WORK.

34:41.871 --> 34:42.955
HOW CLOSE WERE YOU
TO THE PARK

34:43.039 --> 34:45.249
AT THE CLOSEST POINT
IN YOUR WALK?

34:45.291 --> 34:46.793
I'D LIKE YOU TO CONSIDER

34:46.876 --> 34:49.087
IF THERE ISN'T
AN UNFAIR THRUST
IN THAT QUESTION.

34:49.128 --> 34:50.421
OOH...

34:50.505 --> 34:52.340
YOU KNOW, THAT'S
REALLY UNFAIR.

34:52.423 --> 34:54.634
DID YOU SEE
THAT LITTLE GIRL
YESTERDAY, TODD?

34:54.717 --> 34:56.052
THAT WAS A VICIOUS
THING TO DO,

34:56.094 --> 34:58.221
AND I'VE DONE NOTHING
BUT TRY TO COOPERATE.

34:58.262 --> 34:59.222
DO YOU WANT TO
GET HIT AGAIN?

34:59.263 --> 35:00.723
DO I WANT TO
GET HIT AGAIN?

35:00.807 --> 35:02.683
WHY WOULD I WANT
TO GET HIT AGAIN?

35:02.767 --> 35:04.352
DID YOU SEE HER?

35:04.435 --> 35:06.312
IF I DID, I GUESS
THAT WOULD MAKE ME

35:06.395 --> 35:08.356
A VALUABLE PERSON
TO YOUR INVESTIGATION.

35:10.066 --> 35:11.651
OH, YOU ARE VICIOUS.

35:11.734 --> 35:14.153
DO YOU KNOW
WHERE THAT GIRL IS?

35:14.237 --> 35:16.823
IF I DID, I GUESS THAT
WOULD MAKE ME VALUABLE
TO YOUR INVESTIGATION.

35:16.906 --> 35:18.616
YOU THINK YOU'RE
INTO IT, TODD?

35:18.658 --> 35:21.285
WE WILL KILL YOU
AND BURY YOU

35:21.327 --> 35:22.912
WHERE NO ONE
WILL EVER FIND YOU

35:22.954 --> 35:24.372
IN A FIELD IN NASSAU,

35:24.455 --> 35:25.998
AND THEN YOU WON'T
BE INTO ANYTHING.

35:26.082 --> 35:30.545
THAT LITTLE GIRL WAS
WANDERING IN A POSITION
OF VULNERABILITY.

35:30.628 --> 35:31.796
SHE NEEDED RESPITE,

35:31.838 --> 35:33.631
AND SHE NEEDED TO BE
OFF THE STREET.

35:33.673 --> 35:35.299
OH, YOU SICK
SON OF A BITCH.

35:35.341 --> 35:37.301
WHERE IS SHE?
IS SHE ALIVE?

35:37.343 --> 35:40.221
OH, WELL, SUCH A PREDATORY
AND SICK PERSON,
I'M NOT SURE.

35:42.140 --> 35:43.141
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF THIS.

35:43.182 --> 35:44.559
OH, MY GOD.

35:45.560 --> 35:47.311
UH...WAIT A SECOND.

35:47.353 --> 35:48.688
WAIT A SEC. WAIT A SEC.
WAIT A SEC!

35:48.771 --> 35:50.356
NO. WAIT A SEC.

35:50.439 --> 35:53.693
I'LL TELL,
I'LL TELL, I'LL TELL!

36:02.118 --> 36:04.620
GENTLEMEN...

36:04.662 --> 36:06.789
MIGHT WANT TO WORK ON
YOUR PHONE MANNERS, LEO.

36:06.831 --> 36:08.166
THAT MESSAGE
YOU LEFT AT MY OFFICE

36:08.207 --> 36:11.794
SOUNDED A LITTLE LIKE
A SUMMONS FROM ON HIGH.

36:11.836 --> 36:15.840
WOULD YOU RATHER I BROUGHT
THEM OVER TO ARREST YOU?

36:19.177 --> 36:21.012
WHAT THE HELL'S
THE TONE HERE
ABOUT, FELLAS?

36:21.053 --> 36:23.181
IT'S ABOUT YOU BEING
A SCUMBAG SHYSTER

36:23.264 --> 36:26.934
THAT SET 2 MURDERS UP,
WALLY.

36:27.018 --> 36:28.978
EXCUSE ME, DETECTIVE.

36:29.020 --> 36:30.980
I'M NOT SOME
STREET HOODLUM

36:31.022 --> 36:34.358
TO BE INTIMIDATED
OR INSULTED OR BEATEN.

36:34.400 --> 36:36.068
I'D LIKE TO BEAT YOU.

36:36.152 --> 36:39.155
I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU
THE PHOTOS OF THAT
MOTHER AND HER CHILD,

36:39.197 --> 36:42.074
AND THEN I WOULD LIKE
TO KICK YOUR ASS.

36:42.158 --> 36:44.744
ARE YOU ENDORSING
THIS TYPE OF
BEHAVIOR, LEO?

36:44.827 --> 36:46.037
WHICH TYPE, WALLY?

36:46.120 --> 36:47.872
THE TYPE WHERE
YOU FAKE A PLEA
NEGOTIATION WITH ME

36:47.914 --> 36:49.540
WHILE WORKING
AS YOUR CLIENT'S
GO-BETWEEN

36:49.582 --> 36:52.251
ARRANGING A WITNESS
GETTING KILLED?

36:52.335 --> 36:56.505
YOU HAVE ABSOLUTELY,
NOT ONE SCINTILLA
OF VIABLE PROOF

36:56.547 --> 36:58.507
FOR THAT ASSERTION.

36:58.549 --> 37:02.178
WHY ARE YOU SO CONFIDENT
WITH THE "NOT ONE
SCINTILLA," WALLY, HUH?

37:02.220 --> 37:05.348
'CAUSE YOU USED BEARDS
ON ALL YOUR ERRANDS?

37:05.389 --> 37:08.726
THE THING IS, IF WE GO
TO YOUR CLIENT IN THE
JOINT THERE, WALLY,

37:08.809 --> 37:11.270
AND TELL HIM THAT
WE KNOW ALL ABOUT
RAZOR GADDISON

37:11.354 --> 37:13.522
THAT HE HIRED
TO CONTRACT
THIS MURDER OUT,

37:13.564 --> 37:16.609
TELL HIM THAT WE HAVE
THE CONFESSION OF
WHO DID THE MURDER,

37:16.692 --> 37:18.611
NO WAY, TRYING TO BEAT
A LETHAL INJECTION,

37:18.694 --> 37:21.405
IS YOUR CLIENT CARNY
LOOKING TO GIVE
THE LAWYER UP

37:21.447 --> 37:22.990
WHO DID ALL THE LEGWORK.

37:23.074 --> 37:24.408
GIVE ME THAT
COCKY LOOK AGAIN,

37:24.450 --> 37:25.910
YOU FROG-FACED HUMP.

37:25.993 --> 37:27.870
I'M ASSUMING THE IDEA
FOR THESE MURDERS

37:27.912 --> 37:32.416
ORIGINATED
WITH YOUR CLIENT
INSTEAD OF YOU.

37:32.458 --> 37:36.087
FOR THE PURPOSES
OF THIS DISCUSSION,

37:36.128 --> 37:37.755
ASSUME THAT'S ACCURATE.

37:37.797 --> 37:39.090
GET HIS CONFESSION
ON TAPE.

37:39.173 --> 37:42.593
I'LL WORK WITH YOU
ON YOUR PLEA.

37:42.635 --> 37:45.054
YOU WANT ME
TO WEAR A WIRE
ON MY OWN CLIENT?

37:45.096 --> 37:47.139
HEY, WALLY, DISCUSSIONS
OF A SEPARATE CRIME

37:47.223 --> 37:48.474
IN WHICH YOU'RE
BOTH CONSPIRATORS

37:48.557 --> 37:50.601
AIN'T COVERED
BY PRIVILEGE.

38:52.038 --> 38:54.248
[CRYING]

38:56.751 --> 38:58.336
ARE--ARE
THEY STILL OPEN?

38:58.419 --> 39:01.547
RECEPTIONIST LEFT,
BUT HE DID ONE
JUST 2 MINUTES AGO.

39:04.717 --> 39:05.968
Diane: SIR?

39:06.010 --> 39:08.304
SIR, WE'RE COPS.
WE JUST GOT OFF
OUR SHIFT.

39:08.387 --> 39:10.097
[SIGHS] OK.

39:13.225 --> 39:15.019
I GOT THE PAPERWORK.

39:15.102 --> 39:16.937
Diane: OHH.

39:16.979 --> 39:18.606
UH, WHO'S YOUR WITNESS?

39:24.153 --> 39:25.946
Bobby: EXCUSE ME,
CAN I ASK YOU A FAVOR?

39:25.988 --> 39:28.074
WOULD--WOULD YOU BE
OUR WITNESS?

39:28.157 --> 39:30.701
GO AHEAD. I'LL WAIT
IN CASE RICHIE SHOWS UP.

39:30.785 --> 39:32.495
WE REALLY
APPRECIATE IT.

39:34.080 --> 39:35.956
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO USE THESE?

39:35.998 --> 39:37.249
THANK YOU.

39:37.333 --> 39:38.834
Bobby: THANKS.
THANKS VERY MUCH.

39:38.918 --> 39:41.754
MY BROTHER THOUGHT
HE'D MAKE IT, BUT HE
GOT CAUGHT FOR SPEEDING.

39:41.837 --> 39:43.255
YEAH, HUH?

I CAN SEE WHY.

43:28.522 --> 43:31.150
DON'T TELL ABOUT
BOBBY AND DIANE.

43:33.027 --> 43:37.197
