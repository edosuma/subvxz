00:10.935 --> 00:15.082
I knew Matthew Smith for 15 years
before the night of his final show.

00:15.274 --> 00:18.810
Everyone remembers
his talent and face.

00:19.002 --> 00:22.739
But the Matthew I knew was

00:22.931 --> 00:27.044
strange, funny, and
unbearably insecure.

00:27.236 --> 00:30.536
Matthew didn't show up for
that show 10 years ago...

00:30.728 --> 00:32.987
Or any other show after that.

00:33.178 --> 00:35.073
He left us all behind.

00:35.264 --> 00:37.461
He left me, his girlfriend,

00:37.652 --> 00:39.990
speeding off into the night,

00:40.182 --> 00:43.511
completely and utterly totaled.

You're breaking up with me?

01:18.567 --> 01:21.670
Well, you know, breaking up would imply
that we were actually going out, I guess.

three months.

01:23.387 --> 01:26.471

04:52.370 --> 04:53.714
All right, well, you know, keep

up the good work.

04:56.087 --> 04:58.156
I want to feature this guy.

04:58.348 --> 05:00.004
Yeah. Who is it?

05:00.196 --> 05:00.933
Lucas stone.

05:01.125 --> 05:04.163
Why do you got to keep on
featuring all these nobodies?

05:04.355 --> 05:07.219
You know, I thought <i> stax</i> was all about,
you know, discovering new talent.

05:07.411 --> 05:08.694
Isn't that why you hired me?

05:08.886 --> 05:10.792
I probably said that when

05:10.984 --> 05:13.368
stax was still a beloved,
<i>stax</i> was still a beloved,

05:13.560 --> 05:14.551
<i>neolithic music magazine.</i>

05:14.615 --> 05:15.574
Neolithic music magazine.

05:15.644 --> 05:19.329
Things change.

05:19.521 --> 05:22.026
Mm-hmm.

05:22.218 --> 05:22.777
No.

05:22.969 --> 05:25.846
I've been surveying the
territory, and from where I'm

05:26.038 --> 05:27.704
sitting, things are
looking pretty bleak.

05:27.896 --> 05:30.454
Well, I think you're
underestimating our readers.

05:30.646 --> 05:33.689
You clearly have not been
attending the same shareholders

05:33.881 --> 05:35.062
meetings that I have.

05:35.127 --> 05:35.800
Thank God.

05:35.991 --> 05:38.730
Honey, I need you to go after

05:38.922 --> 05:41.341
a bigger piece of
the readership.

05:41.533 --> 05:43.988
You used to be my go-to gal.

05:44.180 --> 05:48.856
Your last story... got
like two comments.

05:49.048 --> 05:51.047
One of them was spam.

05:51.239 --> 05:54.458
Apparently, that means the
world wide web finds your

05:54.650 --> 05:56.678
current sensibility neither

05:56.870 --> 05:59.102
controversial or... I don't

05:59.294 --> 06:03.542
know... interesting.

06:03.543 --> 06:04.857
Matthew Smith.

06:05.048 --> 06:08.933
Last month's anniversary issue,

06:09.124 --> 06:11.685
every artist we polled called
this one of the top-five most

06:11.877 --> 06:12.644
influential records.

06:12.819 --> 06:14.008
Yeah, I'm... I'm aware of that.

06:14.138 --> 06:17.155
Well, I think it
justifies a story.

06:17.347 --> 06:19.575
The lasting the lasting impact."

06:20.214 --> 06:21.479
Giles... you discovered him.

06:21.671 --> 06:22.960
You broke him, for
Christ's sake.

06:23.152 --> 06:25.762
I know that there was a personal

06:25.954 --> 06:28.350
element, but for God's
sake, it was 10 years ago.

06:28.542 --> 06:29.731
You got to have enough distance

06:30.071 --> 06:30.288
by now.

06:30.479 --> 06:31.208
He's probably dead.

06:32.023 --> 06:32.696
He's not dead.

06:32.887 --> 06:34.952
He's just an asshole who's gone.

06:35.144 --> 06:35.828
Even better.

06:36.020 --> 06:39.030
The truth behind the truth
behind the mystery."

06:39.094 --> 06:42.123
You are in a unique
position to do this.

06:42.315 --> 06:43.773
You're sitting on a
huge fucking story.

06:43.867 --> 06:46.354
The professional side of you
has got to understand that.

06:46.546 --> 06:47.620
I am not sitting on a story,

06:48.118 --> 06:48.598
okay?

06:48.615 --> 06:50.326
I'm just not... picking at a

06:50.743 --> 06:50.879
scab.

06:51.071 --> 06:53.398
Okay, well, I cannot have you
ignore what's happening here

06:53.846 --> 06:54.130
anymore.

06:54.322 --> 06:55.940
We got to put a shock through

06:56.132 --> 06:59.111
the system, and everybody's
got to do their part.

06:59.302 --> 07:00.431
Don't make me do this.

07:00.623 --> 07:02.006
You have to reclaim your

07:02.198 --> 07:11.765
place at this magazine.

07:11.766 --> 07:14.518
I mean, I do not get paid
enough to go there again.

07:15.222 --> 07:15.459
Right.

07:15.651 --> 07:17.395
I don't want to relive this.

07:17.586 --> 07:18.246
So quit.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.457
Mm. I can't quit my job.

07:20.649 --> 07:21.667
It's always pride.

07:21.859 --> 07:23.575
So write it.

07:23.639 --> 07:26.008
Are there any other choices?

07:26.200 --> 07:26.763
No.

07:26.954 --> 07:28.652
Excuse me?

07:28.844 --> 07:31.002
Do you want another?

07:31.194 --> 07:33.481
But doesn't part of you
want to know what happened?

07:33.672 --> 07:36.203
I'm trying to think what
I'd do if Angela just...

07:36.395 --> 07:37.992
I mean, I couldn't handle it.

07:38.184 --> 07:39.273
I'd have to know.

07:39.465 --> 07:41.022
Well, how about this idea?

07:41.214 --> 07:42.608
Let's not talk about it anymore.

07:42.800 --> 07:44.296
Oh, now you're heading out?

07:44.487 --> 07:47.073
Yeah. I've got a, uh,
singer to interview.

09:14.327 --> 09:15.686

09:18.642 --> 09:21.639

I mean, who does that anymore?

09:21.831 --> 09:22.909

09:25.512 --> 09:26.471

I decided that you do the

Okay, well, I'm agreeing to it.

way.

12:08.104 --> 12:11.271
I mean, we broke up three times,
but we always got back together.

12:11.463 --> 12:12.384
I mean, he had his shit.

12:12.461 --> 12:13.203
He had his demons.

12:13.395 --> 12:15.640
But he... and he was talented,
as everybody knows.

12:15.832 --> 12:18.569
But there is no way... there is
no way that he would have jumped.

12:18.760 --> 12:21.820
Matthew... he was scared of heights...
<i>Is... Is scared of</i> heights...

12:22.012 --> 12:23.333
Who was scared of heights?

12:23.525 --> 12:26.333
Oh, this musician who's been
lost for years and years...

12:26.525 --> 12:28.076
And years and years.

12:28.267 --> 12:30.676
Really? Lost? Huh.

12:30.867 --> 12:32.274
Charlie.

12:32.466 --> 12:33.417
Ellie.

12:33.609 --> 12:34.691
Ellie klug.

12:34.883 --> 12:35.434
Okay.

12:35.626 --> 12:37.919
It is good to see you.

12:38.111 --> 12:38.618
Oh.

12:38.810 --> 12:43.090
Coming in for an obligatory hug.

12:43.282 --> 12:44.779
The timing wasn't
right when we dated.

12:44.971 --> 12:46.737
I was emotionally unavailable.

12:46.928 --> 12:49.315
Oh, yeah, that's, uh...
That's probably it.

12:49.507 --> 12:52.699
I do think that your lack of
open-mindedness affected your

12:52.891 --> 12:53.892
judgment of me.

12:54.084 --> 12:55.408
I'm much cooler now.

12:55.600 --> 12:56.080
Hmm?

12:56.151 --> 12:58.509
Miss, could I get a clean

12:58.701 --> 13:01.418
glass, a bottle of
water, and a whole lime?

13:01.609 --> 13:01.852
No.

13:02.044 --> 13:03.442
Is she a friend of yours?

13:03.634 --> 13:04.394
She's closing up.

13:04.586 --> 13:06.202
We're going to a gig.

13:06.394 --> 13:08.023
A gig? Huh.

13:08.215 --> 13:09.073
A gig.

13:09.264 --> 13:10.614
What kind of gig?

13:10.806 --> 13:12.252
Uh, a music show.

13:12.444 --> 13:13.929
A music gig.

13:14.121 --> 13:17.159
Nah. That's not my scene.

13:17.351 --> 13:17.924
Good.

13:18.115 --> 13:20.187
What style music is it?

13:20.379 --> 13:21.505
Alternative rock.

13:21.696 --> 13:22.799
Hmm. Alt rock.

13:22.991 --> 13:26.614
You may call it
that if you wish.

13:26.806 --> 13:27.853
Okay.

13:28.044 --> 13:30.092
"Okay" what?

13:30.284 --> 13:31.976
I'll tag along.

14:01.200 --> 14:02.537
I'm retired, but until

14:02.729 --> 14:04.897
recently, I was in the
jewelry business.

14:05.089 --> 14:05.877
Really?

14:06.068 --> 14:08.710
Yeah, we had pieces crafted

14:08.901 --> 14:11.064
from Mexican pesos, bits of

14:11.256 --> 14:13.220
Caribbean currency, seashells.

14:13.412 --> 14:14.332
Sold them online.

14:14.524 --> 14:17.523
I got tired of it, so I dumped
the business last year.

14:17.715 --> 14:20.861
Before that, I had a software
company and made about

14:21.052 --> 14:23.868
$300 million on an I.P.A.,
so I can pay the rent.

14:24.060 --> 14:25.671
Yeah, but you were rich
before that, right?

14:25.767 --> 14:26.319
It's true.

14:26.511 --> 14:28.755
I come from one of the oldest

14:28.947 --> 14:30.837
families in north America, but

14:31.028 --> 14:32.897
truth be told, we lost our

14:33.088 --> 14:34.421
fortune in the panic of 1907.

14:35.191 --> 14:35.447
1907.

14:35.638 --> 14:38.323
Anyway, lately, I've
been taking some

14:38.515 --> 14:41.024
documentary-filmmaking
classes, and I love it.

14:41.216 --> 14:42.700
I really think it's what I'm

14:42.892 --> 14:44.965
meant to do in this world.

14:45.157 --> 14:45.693
I do.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.691
What do you do again, Ellie?

14:47.883 --> 14:49.059
I'm a music critic.

14:49.251 --> 14:51.695
Ugh! That would be the
worst job for me.

14:51.887 --> 14:53.107
I hate music.

14:53.299 --> 14:54.936
All music you hate.

14:55.128 --> 14:56.010
Is the bear a catholic?

14:56.501 --> 14:57.077
I mean, really.

14:57.105 --> 14:58.239
I think he might be.

14:58.431 --> 14:59.613
I mean, you like music?

14:59.804 --> 15:00.842
Okay, well, I'm beat.

15:01.034 --> 15:02.253
I am so exhausted.

15:02.445 --> 15:04.245
Uh... it was really great seeing

15:04.437 --> 15:05.895
you, Charlie, but we... okay.

15:05.911 --> 15:06.563
...dana... do we?

15:07.543 --> 15:07.728
Yeah.

15:07.920 --> 15:08.844
You know what?

15:09.036 --> 15:10.543
Maybe we could get
lunch sometime.

15:10.735 --> 15:12.515
I haven't seen you in five

15:12.706 --> 15:15.534
years, and, uh, it could
be nice to see you again.

15:15.606 --> 15:16.258
Uh, I say... yes!

15:16.328 --> 15:18.287
I should be clear
about one thing.

15:18.479 --> 15:20.124
Uh, I'm off dating, so...

15:20.315 --> 15:23.635
Great. That takes the pressure
off of me to do all the

15:23.826 --> 15:24.746
work in bed.

15:24.938 --> 15:26.722
Do you want to... you want to...

15:26.914 --> 15:28.103
Or do you want to write it?

15:28.295 --> 15:29.579
You know what? I'll get it.

15:29.771 --> 15:30.846
There's a crispness to my

15:31.037 --> 15:34.252
writing that I enjoy.

15:34.444 --> 15:37.501
"Ellie... klug."

15:37.693 --> 15:40.566
Good night, girls.

15:40.631 --> 15:46.249
So, uh... the design
on this site is so...

15:46.441 --> 15:46.920
Just sad.

15:47.095 --> 15:50.187
There was a time, my little
friend, when it was actually

15:50.378 --> 15:51.632
difficult to build a website.

15:51.824 --> 15:52.870
What are you finding?

15:53.062 --> 15:55.653
There's a message board where

15:55.845 --> 15:57.721
people post sightings.

15:57.913 --> 15:59.727
All these people claim
to have seen him?

15:59.919 --> 16:01.002
Claim to, yes.

16:01.193 --> 16:03.039
Here's one for you this year.

16:03.230 --> 16:04.216
Should I e-mail?

16:04.408 --> 16:07.638
It does not look like it, but
we can comment on his post.

16:07.830 --> 16:10.886
Send him my e-mail,
ask for more info.

16:11.078 --> 16:13.565
No, no, no. Wait, wait. Don't.

16:13.757 --> 16:14.956
Yeah, do, do.

16:15.148 --> 16:19.989
Ellie?

16:19.990 --> 16:21.347
I meant to call you.

16:21.539 --> 16:22.345
Yeah?

16:22.537 --> 16:25.179
I, uh... I just... I-I

16:25.371 --> 16:26.855
couldn't write the feature.

16:27.046 --> 16:28.315
Couldn't... couldn't
write it this month?

16:28.507 --> 16:29.617
What do you mean?

16:29.808 --> 16:31.381
It just felt wrong... somehow.

16:32.118 --> 16:32.380
Felt wrong?

16:32.571 --> 16:33.914
What are you... what
are you saying?

16:34.060 --> 16:36.086
You're not gonna write it?

16:36.150 --> 16:38.279
Okay. Is this because we kissed?

16:38.470 --> 16:39.258
Whoop!

16:39.450 --> 16:43.670
Uh, could you answer
that, please?

16:43.735 --> 16:44.843
Ellie klug's desk.

16:45.035 --> 16:47.381
Wow. Well, that sucks.

16:47.445 --> 16:48.619
It's giles.

16:48.811 --> 16:51.816
Hey, can I call you back?

16:52.008 --> 16:52.488
What's up?

16:52.593 --> 16:53.582
How's the story going?

16:53.774 --> 16:56.639
Well, I can't do it if you
keep talking to me, can I?

16:56.831 --> 16:58.097
Okay. I didn't know
you had a son.

16:58.235 --> 16:59.143
Ha ha. Very funny.

16:59.335 --> 16:59.837
Back to work.

17:00.029 --> 17:00.534
I don't even get, like, a

17:00.950 --> 17:01.091
blurb?

17:01.283 --> 17:03.585
I don't even get, like, a little
side blurb, like, the blurb

17:03.926 --> 17:04.282
underneath the blurb?

17:04.474 --> 17:05.238
What do you want me to do?

17:05.430 --> 17:05.929
I don't know.

17:06.008 --> 17:07.356
Apologize, maybe.

17:07.548 --> 17:08.964
Okay. Okay.

17:09.156 --> 17:12.662
I'm sorry. I really am sorry.

17:12.854 --> 17:16.854
Well, apology accepted...
Hesitantly.

17:16.916 --> 17:17.814
Do you want to go out

17:18.388 --> 17:18.626
sometime?

17:18.818 --> 17:21.933
Hey, look, if you're not gonna write
the story, we might as well, right?

17:22.125 --> 17:22.867
What? No.

17:23.059 --> 17:23.539
Yeah.

17:23.696 --> 17:25.423
Listen, whatever you
think is gonna happen...

17:25.910 --> 17:26.069
Yeah?

17:26.262 --> 17:27.557
...is not gonna happen.

17:27.749 --> 17:31.055
No? So, you're gonna crush my dreams and
then you're not gonna give me a date?

17:31.246 --> 17:32.617
Oh, you seem fine to me.

17:32.809 --> 17:34.494
I'm not fine.

17:34.685 --> 17:37.686
I'm broken.

17:44.341 --> 17:49.668
So... who's, uh...
Who's the looker?

17:49.859 --> 18:00.854
That is not intern-level intel...
Sir.

18:14.710 --> 18:16.071
He says that's Matthew.

18:16.263 --> 18:18.486
Could be anybody.

18:18.550 --> 18:20.182
He's in Washington... Hobart, I

18:20.821 --> 18:21.070
guess.

18:21.262 --> 18:23.173
He wants 1,000 bucks.

18:23.364 --> 18:26.270
Oh, I know. I know.

18:26.462 --> 18:30.146
I know we don't do that, so...

18:30.338 --> 18:31.107
don't do what?

18:31.299 --> 18:32.748
Hmm? Pay for sources.

18:32.940 --> 18:34.451
Pay for sources? What are we?

18:34.643 --> 18:35.029
The national enquirer?

18:35.094 --> 18:35.937
<i>The national enquirer?</i>

18:35.960 --> 18:36.726
<i>We don't pay for sources.</i>

18:36.790 --> 18:37.415
We don't pay for sources.

18:37.607 --> 18:40.667
I can't believe you'd
actually make...

18:40.859 --> 18:43.030
That kind of suggestion.

18:43.221 --> 18:45.560
I could get fired.

18:45.751 --> 19:15.413
Uh... he wants cash.

So, listen, I've been doing a

19:47.463 --> 19:50.380
lot of serious thinking, and,
uh, all joking aside, I-I think

19:50.572 --> 19:51.157
I'm willing to give you a second

19:51.734 --> 19:52.342
chance.

19:52.407 --> 19:55.510
Clearly, all those years of
playing music have left you with

19:55.702 --> 19:56.779
a serious hearing problem.

19:56.971 --> 19:57.863
Come on. What is it?

19:58.055 --> 19:59.079
Is it me? Is it my music?

19:59.270 --> 20:00.391
Is my face funny-looking?

20:00.583 --> 20:01.843
I mean, what? Give me something.

20:02.034 --> 20:02.599
Nope. Yeah.

20:02.791 --> 20:03.624
I don't know.

20:03.816 --> 20:05.181
"No, yes, I don't know."

20:05.373 --> 20:07.115
What? I didn't get any of that.

20:07.307 --> 20:08.899
Musicians, I mean, men...

20:09.091 --> 20:11.349
Toxic to me, and you're both, so it's...
it's... it's not

20:12.022 --> 20:12.303
personal.

20:12.495 --> 20:13.541
It's not personal.

20:13.733 --> 20:18.165
How can you say
that's not personal?

20:35.093 --> 20:38.101
Shit.

20:46.454 --> 20:47.033
Hey.

20:47.225 --> 20:49.685
I need your help.

20:50.293 --> 20:50.497
Shoot.

20:50.689 --> 20:52.227
I need you to come with me

20:52.418 --> 20:55.482
tomorrow morning to interview
this guy who says he knows where

20:55.990 --> 20:56.193
Matthew is.

20:56.385 --> 20:56.865
I can't.

20:56.989 --> 20:57.995
I got groundwater thing.

20:58.187 --> 20:58.696
Oh, come on.

20:58.888 --> 20:59.883
Don't make me go alone.

21:00.074 --> 21:02.299
And Angela's finally going with
me, and you know she hates

21:02.742 --> 21:03.020
my "causes."

21:03.211 --> 21:04.586
Hello? Excuse me.

21:04.778 --> 21:19.734
Yes. I see you. Yeah.

21:21.558 --> 21:23.222
Oh, no! Fuck!

21:23.414 --> 21:25.046
Shit!

21:25.110 --> 21:27.649
I promise it's gonna be fine.

21:27.841 --> 21:30.428
No, I am gonna get fired

21:30.620 --> 21:31.707
or... fucking sued or both.

21:31.899 --> 21:33.127
Giles isn't gonna
do that to you.

21:33.183 --> 21:35.487
He already basically said
that I'm irrelevant.

21:35.679 --> 21:37.974
Ellie, please call and
get it over with.

21:38.038 --> 21:41.849
Oh, yes, and in other news...
Who's Lucius?

21:42.041 --> 21:42.951
It's... can you read?

21:43.143 --> 21:43.652
It's Lucas.

21:43.844 --> 21:44.765
Lucas. I'm sorry.

21:44.957 --> 21:46.874
It's the singer that I
didn't do the story on.

21:47.066 --> 21:48.781
He keeps... and I keep...

21:48.973 --> 21:50.360
Well, what'd he say?

21:50.552 --> 21:51.788
Did you listen to it?

21:51.980 --> 21:53.466
Should you listen to it?

21:53.658 --> 21:56.189
Well, then delete it because you

21:56.381 --> 21:57.847
know how it plays out.

21:58.039 --> 21:58.806
What about that guy?

21:58.844 --> 21:59.894
What guy?

21:59.958 --> 22:01.481
The rich guy from the... the

22:01.673 --> 22:03.366
fundraiser at the bar.

22:03.558 --> 22:04.575
Oh, God. Charlie?

22:04.767 --> 22:06.818
Yeah, he likes you,
and he's got money.

22:07.010 --> 22:08.435
And... and he can help you.

22:08.627 --> 22:09.125
No. No way.

22:09.317 --> 22:09.918
No... no way.

22:10.109 --> 22:11.041
I am not doing that.

22:11.232 --> 22:12.802
Well, you should.

22:12.994 --> 22:18.741
I have some pride.

22:18.742 --> 22:20.022
So, you think he's still

22:20.469 --> 22:20.639
alive.

22:20.830 --> 22:21.456
Yeah, I do.

22:21.648 --> 22:22.849
He just ditched you?

22:23.041 --> 22:24.269
Well, I mean, not
ditched, but...

22:24.443 --> 22:26.954
And then disappeared, never
to be heard from again?

22:27.146 --> 22:28.745
Yeah, except maybe for this

22:28.937 --> 22:31.235
guy who says he saw him in
a bar a few months ago.

22:31.427 --> 22:31.967
Wow.

22:32.159 --> 22:35.276
This is really
interesting to me.

22:35.468 --> 22:38.358
Okay. I'll give you the
money to find that guy.

22:38.550 --> 22:40.005
You will? Oh, really?

22:40.197 --> 22:40.702
Mm-hmm.

22:40.894 --> 22:41.699
But it's conditional.

22:42.550 --> 22:42.757
Okay?

22:42.949 --> 22:44.953
Lately, I've been taking some

22:45.145 --> 22:47.963
documentary-filmmaking courses
at a local junior college.

22:48.154 --> 22:51.309
I've been looking for something
that really speaks to me.

22:51.501 --> 22:53.631
Speaks to me... right here.

22:53.822 --> 22:54.781
Okay, so you want to do a

22:55.061 --> 22:55.954
story about Matthew.

22:56.146 --> 22:58.012
No. I want to do a

22:58.204 --> 22:59.926
documentary about <i> you</i> trying to

23:00.565 --> 23:01.397
find Matthew.

23:01.461 --> 23:01.946
No, no, no.

23:02.138 --> 23:04.756
I don't want to be
in your documentary.

23:04.948 --> 23:21.332
And I don't want to
just give you $1,000.

23:21.333 --> 23:23.217
What do you think?

23:23.409 --> 23:26.102
Jesus. What's this?

23:26.294 --> 23:27.903
What the hell is this?

23:28.095 --> 23:30.366
Well, anyone who makes movies

23:30.557 --> 23:31.785
has one of these, so this one is

23:34.102 --> 23:34.582
I did.

23:34.592 --> 23:36.515
They just delivered it.

23:36.707 --> 23:38.436
What do you think?

23:38.628 --> 23:42.965
Uh... permission
to board granted,

23:43.156 --> 23:44.273
my lady.

23:44.464 --> 23:49.270
You know how to drive, right?

23:49.334 --> 23:50.449
What are you doing?

23:50.641 --> 23:51.638
Interviewing you.

23:52.309 --> 23:52.914
What? Now?

23:53.105 --> 23:53.914
Why not?

23:54.106 --> 23:55.540
It's for the documentary.

23:55.732 --> 23:57.222
Because I'm basically driving

23:57.413 --> 23:58.931
a submarine on wheels and I'm

23:59.122 --> 24:00.644
not exactly a strong
driver, so...

24:00.836 --> 24:03.066
Well, let me just tell you...

24:03.258 --> 24:04.916
You are piloting this submarine

24:05.108 --> 24:06.949
on wheels brilliantly.

24:07.141 --> 24:10.921
Interview 1, take 1...
Ellie klug.

24:11.112 --> 24:13.280
And... action.

24:13.472 --> 24:14.420
Okay.

24:14.612 --> 24:17.782
Uh... so... so, Matthew Smith's

24:17.974 --> 24:19.497
music is unique in that it was a

24:19.689 --> 24:21.621
blend of... cut! What is that?

24:22.389 --> 24:24.429
That's, uh... I mean, I don't
really care about that.

24:24.620 --> 24:27.034
Is that, like, music
criticism or something?

24:27.226 --> 24:28.108
Yeah, that's what I do.

24:28.725 --> 24:28.927
Right.

24:29.119 --> 24:30.770
Well, I don't care about that.

24:30.962 --> 24:33.284
And I'm fairly certain that
anybody that views this

24:33.476 --> 24:34.779
documentary won't care, either.

24:34.970 --> 24:35.662
You know what?

24:35.854 --> 24:37.915
I think I'm just gonna focus on

24:38.106 --> 24:39.849
the road here... if
that's okay with you.

24:40.041 --> 24:41.462
Okay. Hostile interview.

24:41.654 --> 24:41.913
Cut.

24:42.105 --> 24:43.232
You know what?

24:43.423 --> 24:45.563
I'm just gonna get some, uh,

24:45.755 --> 24:47.856
various shots of the landscape.

24:48.048 --> 24:49.883
You know, we call it "b" roll

24:50.074 --> 24:51.888
in, uh, filmmaking.

24:52.080 --> 24:53.572
It's for editing.

24:53.764 --> 24:55.469
You're not gonna understand it.

24:55.661 --> 25:09.653
It's over your head.

25:09.654 --> 25:11.469
This better be the right way.

25:11.660 --> 25:13.733
How you feeling?

25:13.925 --> 25:15.223
Uh... anxious.

25:15.415 --> 25:17.729
You know, it'd be good for me and
the documentary film that we're

25:17.731 --> 25:19.956
shooting if you could expound
on your feelings and whatnot.

25:20.024 --> 25:21.570
I don't want to
expound on it, okay?

25:21.762 --> 25:23.091
I'm anxious.

25:23.283 --> 25:35.348
It's been a long time.

25:35.349 --> 25:37.558
Okay. There he is. That's him.

25:37.750 --> 25:41.188
That... that's Matthew?

25:41.380 --> 25:51.124
What? No.

25:51.125 --> 25:53.080
- Hey.
- Hi.

25:53.272 --> 25:54.898
- Joshua?
- Yes.

25:55.068 --> 25:58.203
You, uh... you guys
want to have a seat?

25:58.394 --> 26:00.537
No. I'd invite you in, but, uh,

26:00.729 --> 26:02.288
the place is kind of a mess.

26:02.480 --> 26:03.865
So, that... that... that

26:04.057 --> 26:06.454
video you sent, where
was that recorded?

26:06.646 --> 26:10.128
Yeah. Um... can I ask...
Did... did you

26:10.320 --> 26:11.013
bring the money?

26:11.205 --> 26:12.548
I'm sorry to ask up front like
this.

26:12.724 --> 26:13.722
It's just I've been burned

26:14.518 --> 26:14.943
before, you know?

26:15.134 --> 26:18.098
So I thought if we'd just get
this out of the way, then we'll

26:18.290 --> 26:19.516
be more comfortable.

26:19.708 --> 26:21.345
Sure. Uh, well, actually,

26:21.537 --> 26:23.146
maybe I can give you, uh, half

26:23.338 --> 26:24.997
now and then half when your

26:25.189 --> 26:27.539
information leads to Matthew.

26:27.730 --> 26:30.124
Okay, yeah. Sounds fair.

26:30.316 --> 26:37.749
Okay.

26:37.750 --> 26:38.656
Great. Thanks.

26:38.848 --> 26:41.254
So, I mean, what was it about

26:41.446 --> 26:43.095
this guy that made you
think it was Matthew?

26:43.122 --> 26:43.774
Hang on a second.

26:43.926 --> 26:44.122
Hang on.

26:44.314 --> 26:44.794
Whoa.

26:45.206 --> 26:46.133
What's this about?

26:47.157 --> 26:48.907
Oh, we're making a
documentary about this.

26:49.099 --> 26:49.578
Great.

26:49.763 --> 26:50.546
Rolling.

26:50.738 --> 26:53.884
Let me, uh... let me
tidy up the scene for

26:54.076 --> 26:55.338
you.

26:55.530 --> 26:58.869
So... you said you knew where...
where Matthew was?

26:59.605 --> 27:00.085
Oh, yeah.

27:00.202 --> 27:02.916
He, uh... he lives close by.

27:03.108 --> 27:05.146
Where is he, exactly?

27:05.338 --> 27:08.142
Uh... do you want me
to just go get him?

27:09.205 --> 27:09.742
You know what?

27:09.863 --> 27:10.784
I'll... I'll go get him.

27:11.125 --> 27:11.662
Just stay put.

27:11.793 --> 27:14.431
He lives like 10 minutes
away, 10 minutes's walk.

27:14.623 --> 27:16.387
Uh, so I'll just grab him
and come right back.

27:16.495 --> 27:17.300
Should we come with you?

27:17.398 --> 27:17.580
Uh, no.

27:17.772 --> 27:20.317
Well, he doesn't know I'm coming,
so I'll... I'll just grab him.

27:20.508 --> 27:21.403
We'll be right back.

27:21.595 --> 27:22.526
Just, uh, hang tight.

27:22.718 --> 27:24.696
Just make... make
yourself at home.

27:24.888 --> 27:28.672
Be right back.

27:28.864 --> 27:33.686
We trust you... sir!

27:48.085 --> 27:49.731
Oh, great. Lucas.

27:49.923 --> 27:52.983
Is it all the way out?

27:53.175 --> 27:53.655
Yes.

27:53.793 --> 27:55.273
Does it look cool?

27:55.464 --> 27:58.305
There's so many switches in
here, it's like a spaceship.

27:58.497 --> 28:03.510
Kidding me?

28:03.574 --> 28:16.980
Charlie?

28:16.981 --> 28:18.065
What's going on here?

28:18.257 --> 28:21.109
Uh, we're just... we're just waiting for...
for Joshua to

28:21.814 --> 28:22.039
come back.

28:22.231 --> 28:22.711
Joshua?

28:22.903 --> 28:25.460
The guy that lives
in that trailer.

28:26.805 --> 28:27.142
He was just here.

28:27.333 --> 28:29.521
Don't no one live in that
trailer, 'cause I know who live

28:29.717 --> 28:29.995
in my trailer.

28:30.186 --> 28:30.741
It sure looked like he lived

28:31.220 --> 28:31.412
in there.

28:31.604 --> 28:32.454
This is <i> your</i> trailer?

28:32.645 --> 28:34.414
I'm gonna need you
off my property.

28:34.485 --> 28:34.712
Okay.

28:34.904 --> 28:36.923
Well... yep. Yep. Yep.

28:37.115 --> 28:40.382
We're out of here.

28:40.574 --> 28:43.911
Have a great night.

28:44.103 --> 28:45.690
Maybe we should call the police.

28:45.882 --> 28:47.374
What are they gonna do?

28:47.566 --> 28:50.261
Apart from arrest me for being

28:50.453 --> 28:52.998
completely... naive and stupid.

28:53.190 --> 28:54.965
Well, the good news is... you
can take your time paying me

28:55.221 --> 28:55.358
back.

28:55.550 --> 28:58.112
Of course, I'll have to charge

28:58.304 --> 29:00.154
you interest.

29:00.345 --> 29:03.550
Please tell me you're joking.

29:03.742 --> 29:04.394
Charlie?

29:04.586 --> 29:06.484
Yes, I'm joking.

29:06.548 --> 29:08.213
But we're not gonna quit,

29:08.758 --> 29:08.967
okay?

29:09.159 --> 29:10.454
This is nowhere near the end of

29:10.901 --> 29:11.087
it.

29:11.278 --> 29:13.889
Uh... this is a complete and

29:14.081 --> 29:15.264
utter dead end.

29:15.456 --> 29:16.958
We have the video.

29:17.150 --> 29:18.463
The video is just
some stupid bait.

29:18.654 --> 29:19.844
You can't even see who's really

29:20.309 --> 29:20.389
playing.

29:20.581 --> 29:21.103
Come on.

29:21.295 --> 29:22.312
Listen to me.

29:22.504 --> 29:24.309
You have an obligation to your

29:24.501 --> 29:26.725
story, to your magazine, and,

29:26.917 --> 29:30.136
most importantly, to me to
complete a documentary film that

29:30.328 --> 29:31.335
we set out to make.

29:31.527 --> 29:32.946
And I don't have
enough footage, okay?

29:33.073 --> 29:35.140
I have like three minutes, and

29:35.332 --> 29:38.169
most of it is him running
away up that hill.

29:38.361 --> 29:41.586
Well, I-I am not an
investigative reporter.

29:41.778 --> 29:42.727
I am a music critic.

29:42.919 --> 29:48.140
I don't know what the
hell I'm doing, so...

29:48.332 --> 29:52.218
Then let's find
someone who does.

29:52.410 --> 29:59.636
This is a note he... he left me.

29:59.637 --> 30:00.327
This is the last

30:00.518 --> 30:03.655
communication he had with you?

30:03.847 --> 30:05.813
Yes.

30:05.878 --> 30:08.582
"Babe, well, it's been a run,

30:08.774 --> 30:11.572
honey, a real run, a sprint at

30:12.277 --> 30:12.506
times.

30:12.698 --> 30:14.436
Does this got to be?

30:14.628 --> 30:17.094
Yeah, for me, and I say for you.

30:17.286 --> 30:18.901
I'm in a dark place.

30:19.093 --> 30:22.457
You know, what comes
up must come down.

30:22.649 --> 30:25.591
I know you understand.

30:25.782 --> 30:26.646
Matthew."

30:26.837 --> 30:27.946
What do you think?

30:28.138 --> 30:29.274
What is he talking about?

30:29.466 --> 30:30.142
I don't know.

30:30.334 --> 30:31.505
It's just... it's him.

30:31.697 --> 30:34.221
But he says, "I know
you understand."

30:34.413 --> 30:36.630
Well, I don't.

30:36.822 --> 30:38.675
I don't think it's useful.

30:38.867 --> 30:40.439
Don't you want to analyze
it or something?

30:40.789 --> 30:40.925
Why?

30:41.117 --> 30:41.983
I don't know.

30:42.174 --> 30:44.877
Just, like, figure out where
the paper was manufactured or

30:45.069 --> 30:45.989
analyze his handwriting.

30:46.101 --> 30:46.712
I don't know.

30:46.903 --> 30:49.880
What? Do you think it's
not his handwriting?

30:50.072 --> 30:51.598
No. It is.

30:51.790 --> 30:53.694
You know what?

30:53.886 --> 30:56.009
We have a video.

30:56.201 --> 30:59.252
It's crude, but it's a
documentation of sorts.

30:59.254 --> 30:59.733
Okay, yeah.

30:59.816 --> 31:01.780
Okay, I have this
video of him singing.

31:01.845 --> 31:02.869
Well, it <i> sounds like him.</i>

31:03.061 --> 31:05.125
<i>Maybe you can take a look at it,
</i> maybe you can take a look at it,

31:05.317 --> 31:06.935
like, isolate the
voice or something.

31:07.127 --> 31:09.318
I-I think you have some wrong

31:09.510 --> 31:11.708
expectations about what I do.

31:11.900 --> 31:12.926
I follow people.

31:13.118 --> 31:14.042
Living people.

31:14.234 --> 31:15.761
Would you like this back?

31:15.953 --> 31:17.529
You don't need it?

31:17.721 --> 31:21.493
No.

31:21.494 --> 31:24.442
You know, I think maybe I
should take on your case.

31:24.634 --> 31:27.805
You can't take on the case because
you're not a private detective, Charlie.

31:27.997 --> 31:29.676
We need to go back to the

31:29.867 --> 31:34.135
beginning, back to the
scene of the crime.

31:34.327 --> 31:35.765
And this one... it's a move that

31:36.757 --> 31:37.461
I invented.

31:37.653 --> 31:39.563
It's a pistol whip.

31:39.755 --> 31:40.967
A gunslinger whip.

31:41.159 --> 31:42.265
A gunslinger tilt.

31:42.457 --> 31:43.605
You ready?

31:43.796 --> 31:45.014
You ready?

31:45.205 --> 31:45.910
Action.

31:46.102 --> 31:49.018
How old were you when
you met Matthew Smith?

31:49.209 --> 31:49.963
I was 16.

31:50.155 --> 31:51.710
In the interest of

31:51.901 --> 31:54.104
documentary filmmaking,
just elaborate.

31:54.296 --> 31:58.933
I was 16 when I met
Matthew Smith.

31:59.125 --> 32:02.195
Here at this camp.

32:02.387 --> 32:05.278
Mm... that was a little
dry, emotionally.

32:05.470 --> 32:06.882
Want to try it again?

32:07.073 --> 32:08.999
This is where we had
our first kiss.

32:09.191 --> 32:11.151
Really? How was it?

32:11.343 --> 32:12.309
Too much tongue.

32:12.373 --> 32:14.335
I mean, neither of us knew what

32:14.527 --> 32:16.373
we were doing.

32:16.437 --> 32:18.800
We got much better
at it over time.

32:18.991 --> 32:20.627
That was it? Just kissing?

32:20.818 --> 32:23.113
Yeah. That was a big
deal for me back then.

32:23.305 --> 32:26.600
I wasn't exactly... confident.

32:26.792 --> 32:28.259
Nobody here was.

32:28.450 --> 32:28.946
Why?

32:29.138 --> 32:32.343
Why weren't you confident?

32:32.535 --> 32:34.836
It was, uh... it was...

32:35.027 --> 32:37.077
It was a weight-loss camp.

32:37.269 --> 32:39.208
Weight-loss camp? Hang on.

32:39.400 --> 32:40.704
You met at fat camp?

32:40.896 --> 32:42.316
It's not funny, Charlie.

32:42.508 --> 32:43.165
Fat camp.

32:43.357 --> 32:45.323
Fat camp is a little funny.

32:45.515 --> 32:46.868
Stop saying "fat camp."

32:47.060 --> 32:50.094
Well, did they call it
something else, like

32:50.286 --> 32:51.917
k-a-m-p p-h-a-t?

32:52.109 --> 32:52.989
Come here.

32:53.181 --> 32:56.533
This is where we he
wrote his first song.

32:56.597 --> 32:59.000
Performed it at talent night.

32:59.191 --> 33:03.114
Oh, God, it was
really beautiful.

33:03.306 --> 33:04.448
Yeah?

33:04.640 --> 33:07.665
What'd you do?

33:07.857 --> 33:09.079
I cried.

33:09.271 --> 33:12.480
No, f-for talent night.

33:12.672 --> 33:15.406
Oh. I, uh... I hula-hooped.

33:15.598 --> 33:20.555
Did you terrify small children?

33:20.747 --> 33:23.573
Shut up.

33:23.765 --> 33:25.921
After camp, you know, we said

33:26.113 --> 33:32.212
we'd stay in touch.

33:32.213 --> 33:35.688
Yeah. He wrote me these...

33:35.879 --> 33:43.219
Really beautiful letters.

33:43.220 --> 33:47.380
Is that enough?

33:50.605 --> 33:52.205
You know, I got to figure out

33:52.397 --> 33:55.465
how to get this footage on
to my new editing system.

33:55.657 --> 33:57.275
Or you know what?

33:57.467 --> 34:00.479
Maybe I can just edit on here.

34:00.671 --> 34:04.725
That was weird.

34:04.726 --> 34:06.242
I don't think you're letting

34:06.434 --> 34:08.826
yourself see the new me.

34:09.018 --> 34:11.665
Charlie, neither of us are new.

34:11.857 --> 34:12.766
Pbht!

34:12.958 --> 34:14.693
I just think that
you and I could...

34:14.885 --> 34:16.507
Okay, don't do take this

34:16.699 --> 34:19.504
personally, but I'm not looking.

34:19.696 --> 34:22.094
Seriously, I'm... I'm not.

34:22.286 --> 34:23.214
That's cool.

34:23.406 --> 34:24.699
It's totally cool.

34:24.891 --> 34:26.728
That's a gracious rejection.

34:26.920 --> 34:29.722
I don't know why I'd
take that personal.

34:29.914 --> 34:32.434
I'm gonna hit the hay.

34:32.626 --> 34:34.690
I'll take the rear bunk.

34:34.882 --> 34:38.279
And you're in the,
uh, forward deck.

34:38.471 --> 34:41.380
Okay. Solo.

34:41.572 --> 34:45.201
Good night.

34:45.393 --> 34:47.860
Night.

34:47.925 --> 34:50.684
Ready? Ready?

34:50.875 --> 34:52.918
And... action.

34:53.110 --> 34:56.443
This is where Matthew first

34:56.635 --> 34:58.269
started playing.

34:58.461 --> 34:59.442
Man, he loved it here.

34:59.633 --> 35:02.464
I used to, uh... I used to sneak
out of college to come see him.

35:02.655 --> 35:06.603
Then we'd go on the
road together and...

35:06.795 --> 35:10.074
Yeah, it was a lot of fun.

35:10.265 --> 35:11.274
Actually, you know what?

35:11.466 --> 35:12.830
It... it wasn't that much fun.

35:13.022 --> 35:14.459
Everybody wanted him, and it was

35:14.651 --> 35:16.697
like I got into some kind of

35:16.888 --> 35:23.253
fucked-up conga line.

35:23.254 --> 35:25.020
Was this the place?

35:25.212 --> 35:27.192
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

35:27.384 --> 35:28.853
Uh, they found his car over

35:29.845 --> 35:30.732
there.

35:30.924 --> 35:34.994
That's a long way down.

35:35.186 --> 35:37.331
No one could survive that...
No one.

35:37.460 --> 35:38.228
Charlie.

35:38.420 --> 35:54.036
I'm sorry. My bad.

35:54.037 --> 35:56.013
I think that Matthew may have

35:56.205 --> 35:57.882
been left-handed.

35:58.073 --> 35:58.879
Yeah, he was.

35:59.071 --> 36:00.446
Really?

36:00.638 --> 36:04.534
Mm.

36:07.029 --> 36:08.469
So, did you know Matthew Smith?

36:08.661 --> 36:09.539
I knew him.

36:09.731 --> 36:12.322
I mean, I didn't know him,
know him, but I-I-I knew him.

36:12.514 --> 36:14.777
I mean, if I've seen the inside
of his house, I've seen the

36:14.957 --> 36:16.531
inside of his house, but a lot

36:16.723 --> 36:18.318
of people have seen the
inside of that guy's house.

36:18.510 --> 36:19.450
He was hugely talented.

36:19.642 --> 36:19.732
Hugely.

36:19.797 --> 36:20.082
<i>Hugely.</i>

36:20.274 --> 36:23.113
<i>What does... what does</i> what does...
what does Matthew Smith's music mean to

36:23.126 --> 36:23.331
you?

36:23.523 --> 36:26.735
He was a huge influence on my

36:26.927 --> 36:29.482
music, all my friends's music...

36:29.674 --> 36:31.298
Maybe all music, I
mean, music itself.

36:31.489 --> 36:33.676
People talk about cobain,
but fuck cobain.

36:33.868 --> 36:35.484
He could have been so much more.

36:35.676 --> 36:37.126
He could have been our

36:37.317 --> 36:39.078
generation's... voice.

36:39.270 --> 36:40.922
There's people that kind of

36:41.114 --> 36:43.668
come and go in the music scene

36:43.860 --> 36:47.235
whose "ghosts" always
live on, you know?

36:47.427 --> 36:50.357
And he's definitely one of them.

36:50.548 --> 36:52.113
I mean, you guys... you guys

36:52.304 --> 36:53.938
were pretty tight, right?

36:54.129 --> 36:56.229
We got wasted a couple times.

36:56.421 --> 36:58.965
And did he ever seem like he,
you know, just wanted to...

36:59.637 --> 37:00.649
...disappear?

37:00.841 --> 37:04.751
What the hell do I know?

37:04.943 --> 37:06.651
I bounce drunks.

37:06.842 --> 37:07.322
Lucas.

37:07.498 --> 37:09.358
There she is. How you doing?

37:09.550 --> 37:10.185
Yeah, good.

37:10.376 --> 37:12.015
Uh, Lucas... uh, this is Lucas.

37:12.206 --> 37:13.259
Lucas, this is Charlie.

37:13.451 --> 37:15.459
He's making a documentary
I'm helping him with.

37:15.651 --> 37:16.309
How's it going?

37:16.501 --> 37:17.003
Good.

37:17.195 --> 37:20.542
Um... man, you never
called me back.

37:20.734 --> 37:23.771
Yeah. I just, uh... yeah.

37:23.963 --> 37:25.154
These things happen.

37:25.346 --> 37:27.418
Hey, you should, uh... you
should at least have one of

37:27.702 --> 37:27.970
these.

37:28.162 --> 37:30.607
Here, you too, man.

37:30.799 --> 37:31.786
No, sir.

37:31.978 --> 37:33.495
When did you get these made?

37:33.687 --> 37:34.987
Uh, last week, actually.

37:35.179 --> 37:36.061
These look really good.

37:36.308 --> 37:36.459
Yeah?

37:36.651 --> 37:37.505
Yeah. Good for you.

37:37.697 --> 37:38.349
Thanks very much.

37:38.410 --> 37:39.765
Hey, if you guys are free
tonight, you should come down

37:40.276 --> 37:40.756
the street.

37:40.813 --> 37:42.622
I'm playing a little gig on the

37:42.814 --> 37:44.317
stage, so not just a sidewalk

37:44.509 --> 37:46.081
and drunk people yelling at me.

37:46.272 --> 37:47.270
Yeah, sure. Why not? Yeah.

37:47.419 --> 37:47.790
Do you want to?

37:47.981 --> 37:48.461
Of course.

37:48.544 --> 37:49.748
You should come, too, man.

37:49.940 --> 37:50.774
Wait. What?

37:50.966 --> 37:54.804
You... you want to
come, Charlie, or...

37:55.285 --> 37:55.418
Now?

37:55.610 --> 37:56.869
We're... we're quitting?

37:57.061 --> 37:58.034
I think we're good for tonight.

37:58.226 --> 38:01.020
I mean, if you guys are doing your
thing, you know, maybe I'll see you.

38:01.212 --> 38:02.032
I don't want to...

38:02.224 --> 38:03.286
Let's go. Go with you now.

38:03.478 --> 38:04.398
All right, cool. Then...

38:04.587 --> 38:05.570
Hey, see you later, Doug.

38:05.762 --> 38:10.691
Um, good luck with the doc, man.

38:10.883 --> 38:18.548
What just happened, man?

38:20.916 --> 38:22.336
Thank you, guys.

38:22.528 --> 38:25.973
Um, okay, this is a new one,

38:26.165 --> 38:28.068
and, uh, I haven't really played

38:28.260 --> 38:29.948
it before live, so
we'll see how it goes.

38:30.140 --> 38:32.972
But, uh, I wrote it
for someone special.

38:33.045 --> 38:36.241
I know that sounds cheesy, but,

38:36.433 --> 38:39.472
uh, it's true.

38:39.664 --> 38:43.244
♪ Yeah, she ♪

38:43.436 --> 38:49.395

39:34.868 --> 39:37.493
Sure. Just follow you around...

39:37.557 --> 39:39.157
...singing all the time.

39:39.637 --> 39:39.921
Yeah.

39:40.112 --> 39:42.350
Wow. Someone singing songs

39:42.542 --> 39:43.572
written about me.

39:43.763 --> 39:45.766
Hasn't happened in a long time.

39:45.958 --> 39:47.809
Actually, um, I didn't... I

39:48.000 --> 39:49.711
didn't write that one about you.

39:49.903 --> 39:50.634
Oh, my God.

39:50.826 --> 39:52.791
No, I-I-I wrote it for this,

39:52.983 --> 39:54.580
uh, guy I met in prison.

39:54.645 --> 39:56.437
His name's Bobby. "Big Bob."

39:57.173 --> 39:57.797
Big Bob?

39:57.989 --> 39:58.976
Big bog.

39:59.168 --> 40:00.775
Big Bobby.

40:00.967 --> 40:05.341
Big Bob was a sweetheart.

40:05.533 --> 40:07.868
Here we are.

40:08.060 --> 40:08.931
Wow.

40:09.122 --> 40:09.855
Yeah.

40:10.047 --> 40:13.663
What are we gonna do today?

40:13.855 --> 40:15.113
I don't know.

40:15.304 --> 40:16.520
Well, you know what?

40:16.712 --> 40:20.140
I-I think we should do something

40:20.332 --> 40:22.166
really stupid.

40:22.358 --> 40:24.399
Like, really stupid.

40:24.591 --> 40:25.236
Let's do this!

40:25.908 --> 40:27.991
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

40:28.183 --> 40:31.349
Terrible, terrible idea.

40:31.413 --> 40:32.430
Oh, my God.

40:32.622 --> 40:34.676
You're a madman.

40:34.868 --> 40:35.837
What was that?

40:36.029 --> 40:37.654
Put something on. Here.

40:37.846 --> 40:40.572
I can't feel my testicles.

40:40.764 --> 40:43.818
That outfit is... fantastic.

40:44.009 --> 40:46.117
Man, you got a lot of records.

40:46.309 --> 40:49.012
And, by the way, who the
hell still has cds?

40:49.203 --> 40:49.742
I do.

40:49.933 --> 40:51.252
That is a lot of cds.

40:51.924 --> 40:55.221
Man, it is crazy that you
used to hang with him.

40:55.412 --> 40:57.506
Like, you used to hang
out with Matthew Smith.

40:57.698 --> 41:02.899
Yeah, well... that's insane.

41:03.090 --> 41:05.141
Dude's, like, my idol.

41:05.333 --> 41:06.219
No kidding.

41:06.411 --> 41:07.981
And why did he kill himself?

41:08.172 --> 41:09.556
It's like if I had half the

41:09.748 --> 41:15.251
talent that this guy had...

41:15.252 --> 41:16.474
That is the best song.

41:16.666 --> 41:18.961
"Inside"? I love that song.

41:19.152 --> 41:21.816
I used to listen to that song on

41:22.007 --> 41:23.995
repeat in eighth grade.

41:24.186 --> 41:25.627
Hi. You guys ready to order?

41:25.819 --> 41:26.549
Uh... the salad.

41:26.741 --> 41:27.337
The dressing.

41:27.529 --> 41:28.008
Yes?

41:28.044 --> 41:29.784
Does that have dairy?

41:29.976 --> 41:30.743
I can check for you.

41:31.316 --> 41:33.086
I'm extremely
lactose-intolerant.

41:33.278 --> 41:35.370
If it has dairy, uh, I can't
have it anywhere near me.

41:35.562 --> 41:35.844
Okay.

41:36.035 --> 41:38.916
Also, I will have the toast,
but you'll need to burn that

41:39.108 --> 41:40.451
because I cannot
ingest live gluten.

41:40.602 --> 41:43.026
Okay, so, I'll... I'll just
take the, uh... the burger,

41:43.218 --> 41:45.332
medium-rare, please.

41:45.524 --> 41:46.817
Thank you.

41:47.009 --> 41:50.072
So, I met a sound specialist
who thinks he might be able to

41:50.264 --> 41:51.373
do something with the video.

41:51.565 --> 41:52.045
Hmm.

41:52.112 --> 41:54.396
I think I might be a better

41:54.588 --> 41:57.132
investigative journalist than I

41:57.324 --> 41:59.556
am a documentary filmmaker.

41:59.748 --> 42:01.368
Well, Ellie, I think I have

42:01.560 --> 42:03.490
found the woman that I am going

42:03.682 --> 42:05.627
to spend the rest of my life

42:05.819 --> 42:08.014
with, until they crank my coffin

42:08.205 --> 42:09.758
into a coffin-sized hole.

42:09.950 --> 42:11.451
Wow. That was fast.

42:11.643 --> 42:13.419
Love happens, it happens.

42:13.611 --> 42:14.580
Are you shocked?

42:14.772 --> 42:15.808
I'm... I'm... no, I'm happy

42:16.052 --> 42:16.274
for you.

42:16.466 --> 42:17.104
Thank you.

42:17.296 --> 42:18.322
Yeah, I really am.

42:18.514 --> 42:20.374
Her name is Charlotte.

42:20.565 --> 42:23.073
She's fun. She's beautiful.

42:23.265 --> 42:23.984
She's young.

42:24.176 --> 42:24.877
She's amazing.

42:25.069 --> 42:26.202
And I know she's the one.

42:26.394 --> 42:27.468
I have a way of telling now.

42:27.625 --> 42:28.591
Oh, really? How?

42:28.783 --> 42:31.879
I've devised a system that
can apply to any couple.

42:32.071 --> 42:33.083
It goes like this.

42:33.275 --> 42:34.803
If the relationship can be

42:34.995 --> 42:37.770
summed up in a single sentence,
it will never survive.

42:37.962 --> 42:39.308
I'll give you an example.

42:39.500 --> 42:41.390
The previous relationship, our

42:41.582 --> 42:44.053
single sentence was, "she is the

42:44.245 --> 42:46.676
lost child to my father figure."

42:46.868 --> 42:48.945
In another one, I was the exotic

42:49.137 --> 42:51.125
aesthete to her
midwestern homebody.

42:51.317 --> 42:52.775
Exotic aesthete?

42:52.967 --> 42:54.886
And with another, "she is my

42:55.077 --> 42:58.098
every sexual fantasy, but she
just wants her bare bottom

42:58.516 --> 42:58.995
spanked."

42:59.132 --> 43:02.348
Right. So, you're saying it
works with you and Charlotte

43:02.540 --> 43:04.618
because there's not one
sentence that describes you.

43:04.810 --> 43:05.373
Exactly.

43:05.565 --> 43:08.780
And what about you and Matthew?

43:08.972 --> 43:11.999
I was the carpenter to his

43:12.191 --> 43:14.210
unfixable... fixer-upper.

43:14.402 --> 43:15.947
"Can't save nobody."

43:16.139 --> 43:18.051
It's a famous saying.

43:18.243 --> 43:20.178
An enormous earthquake hit

43:20.370 --> 43:22.830
kabanjahe, Indonesia,
two days ago.

43:23.022 --> 43:26.034
There are probably over 500

43:26.226 --> 43:27.807
animals that have died.

43:27.998 --> 43:30.052
Most of these animals will,

43:30.244 --> 43:31.476
unfortunately, go without proper

43:32.180 --> 43:32.659
burial.

43:32.779 --> 43:35.782
We need to aid these souls, help

43:35.974 --> 43:38.266
them transition into the next

43:38.458 --> 43:40.804
stage of their existence.

43:40.995 --> 43:44.688
So please remember
today, heart to heart...

43:44.879 --> 43:49.292
Soul to soul... paw to paw.

43:49.484 --> 43:51.557
Charlie has told me all about

43:51.749 --> 43:53.893
your search for Matthew Smith.

43:54.084 --> 43:56.911
I was a huge fan of his
in junior high school.

43:57.102 --> 43:58.640
You know, originally, I

43:58.832 --> 44:01.269
volunteered to help Ellie find
Matthew because I wanted to have

44:01.876 --> 44:02.484
sex with her.

44:02.548 --> 44:03.828
Jesus! That's not... that's

44:04.436 --> 44:04.649
not true.

44:04.841 --> 44:05.372
It's fine.

44:05.564 --> 44:06.695
I'm not threatened.

44:06.887 --> 44:07.539
You shouldn't be.

44:08.660 --> 44:09.650
Look at the house.

44:09.841 --> 44:13.348
Look at how she's
completely made it over.

44:13.539 --> 44:16.993
It's just aglow with love and

44:17.185 --> 44:19.247
warmth and that dream catcher.

44:19.438 --> 44:21.137
She's got a great eye, not

44:21.329 --> 44:23.618
unlike my mother... except, you

44:23.810 --> 44:25.831
know, Charlotte's
alive and gorgeous.

44:26.023 --> 44:27.676
That sounds like your sentence.

44:27.867 --> 44:29.509
Oh, come on.

44:29.701 --> 44:33.919
By the way, what are you and...

44:34.111 --> 44:36.986
LA... lagary... Lucas.
His name is Lucas.

44:37.178 --> 44:38.252
What are you and Lucas doing

44:39.380 --> 44:39.902
I don't know.

44:40.094 --> 44:41.846
Well, Charlotte and I have

44:42.037 --> 44:43.953
something wonderful
to celebrate.

44:44.144 --> 44:46.388
Don't we, my dear?

44:46.452 --> 44:47.378
Celebrate?

44:47.570 --> 44:52.788
Her lips are like
tiny sugar pillows.

44:52.852 --> 44:55.563
♪ Endless love ♪

44:55.754 --> 44:58.611
That's lovely.

44:59.444 --> 44:59.923
Oh, my God.

44:59.988 --> 45:00.717
That thing is huge!

45:01.461 --> 45:01.959
Look at that.

45:02.082 --> 45:03.240
That is beautiful.

45:03.432 --> 45:04.568
You guys are coming, right?

45:04.760 --> 45:06.553
Uh... to the wedding?

45:06.745 --> 45:08.235
Yeah. Yeah. When is it?

45:08.427 --> 45:09.079
Next week.

45:09.271 --> 45:09.911
Oh, God.

45:10.103 --> 45:10.929
What? Uh, wow.

45:11.121 --> 45:12.916
That's... it's really great.

45:13.107 --> 45:14.150
That's really kind of...
Exciting.

45:14.342 --> 45:16.841
Well, when you know,
you know, and we know.

45:17.033 --> 45:18.803
So, I'm chartering a jet and

45:18.995 --> 45:21.515
we're flying over, and
you got to come with us.

45:21.707 --> 45:22.476
You have a private jet?

45:22.485 --> 45:22.669
Mm-hmm.

45:22.861 --> 45:25.040
Yeah, we'll... we'll fly
on your private jet, sure.

45:25.232 --> 45:27.188
Of course, you know, I've
really been trying to get

45:27.345 --> 45:28.863
Charlie to enjoy objects more.

45:29.055 --> 45:32.118
I just... I think it would be
good for him, you know, because

45:32.310 --> 45:34.369
we're in such a golden
era of materialism.

45:34.561 --> 45:36.685
And we all have a slot to fill

45:36.877 --> 45:38.324
in the world, and until you

45:38.516 --> 45:41.444
learn to fill that slot, you're just...
you're fighting against

45:41.636 --> 45:42.428
the natural order.

45:42.620 --> 45:43.992
You'll never be
completely at peace.

45:44.184 --> 45:45.579
I've been studying
all about this.

45:45.770 --> 45:46.250
Oh, wow.

45:46.397 --> 45:48.613
So, there's... there's, like,
papers written on this?

45:48.805 --> 45:49.629
Oh, yeah, tons.

45:49.821 --> 45:52.052
Are they written in crayon?

45:52.116 --> 45:53.268
That's really insulting.

45:53.460 --> 45:55.347
No, they're not in crayon.

45:55.539 --> 45:57.192
Charlie has rich-man's guilt.

45:57.384 --> 45:57.864
I do?

45:58.035 --> 45:58.515
Mm-hmm.

45:58.570 --> 46:00.872
Even your... your documentary

46:01.064 --> 46:03.692
filmmaking is an effect
of your misalignment.

46:03.700 --> 46:03.963
Right.

46:04.155 --> 46:07.299
Documentaries... they're
a platform for the poor.

46:07.491 --> 46:09.078
They should be by poor people,

46:09.270 --> 46:10.842
for poor people,
about poor people.

46:11.034 --> 46:14.261
You know, I once saw this
little film online, and it was,

46:14.453 --> 46:16.811
uh, made by a monkeys, about
monkeys, for monkeys.

46:17.002 --> 46:18.176
That's not true, is it?

46:18.368 --> 46:21.019
The whole thing's like 10
seconds long, and it's just

46:21.211 --> 46:23.798
this shaking camera with
occasional glimpses of, like, a

46:23.990 --> 46:25.335
banana and other monkeys.

46:25.526 --> 46:27.349
And then the camera breaks.

46:27.413 --> 46:30.846
That's... not funny at all.

46:31.038 --> 46:32.637
That would be animal cruelty.

46:32.828 --> 46:33.308
Right.

46:33.475 --> 46:36.462
It was just a funny little...

46:36.654 --> 46:38.507
It's just a... video.

46:38.699 --> 46:39.736
The golden age of materialism?

46:39.797 --> 46:40.563
What?

46:40.627 --> 46:42.073
She's kind of crazy, right?

46:42.264 --> 46:44.196
Thank you for being nice.

46:44.388 --> 46:45.424
Yeah. When am I not nice?

46:45.615 --> 46:47.854
You're the one who
can't fake it.

46:48.046 --> 46:50.140
You look really cute tonight.

46:50.332 --> 46:54.004
Thanks, baby.

46:54.068 --> 46:54.715
What's going on?

46:54.907 --> 46:55.957
Are you nervous about your

46:56.340 --> 46:56.420
meeting?

46:56.612 --> 46:57.091
Hmm? No.

46:57.221 --> 46:58.360
You don't need to be.

46:58.552 --> 46:59.626
I mean, he's gonna love you.

46:59.706 --> 47:00.727
No, it's gonna be good.

47:00.919 --> 47:02.332
Thank you for hooking that up.

47:02.524 --> 47:03.222
Of course.

47:03.414 --> 47:05.242
You don't have to thank me.

47:05.434 --> 47:06.313
You're up, champ.

47:06.505 --> 47:07.363
Thanks, bud.

47:07.554 --> 47:08.793
Glory hole is stall 3.

47:08.985 --> 47:11.379
Wow.

47:11.443 --> 47:13.563
It's exciting, isn't it?

47:13.755 --> 47:14.964
What?

47:15.156 --> 47:16.119
Love.

47:16.310 --> 47:17.310
Me, Charlotte.

47:17.502 --> 47:18.420
You, Lucas.

47:18.612 --> 47:21.478
You guys are gonna have a
great time at the wedding.

47:21.670 --> 47:23.332
And I'm gonna tell Charlotte to

47:23.524 --> 47:25.524
throw the bouquet at you as hard

47:25.716 --> 47:30.355
as she can.

47:30.356 --> 47:31.532
So, what is going on?

47:31.724 --> 47:33.636
What do you got for me?

47:33.828 --> 47:35.202
Well, yeah, it's coming along.

47:35.393 --> 47:37.194
Ellie, your deadline
is next week.

47:37.386 --> 47:40.567
Can I just get a little, tiny
progress report, please?

47:40.759 --> 47:42.401
Okay. Uh, well, if you... if

47:42.593 --> 47:45.778
you have to know, the truth is...
I, uh...

47:45.970 --> 47:47.159
I'm kind of seeing somebody, so

47:47.285 --> 47:48.572
my time is... oh,
for God's sake.

47:48.763 --> 47:49.531
I could give a shit.

47:49.693 --> 47:50.436
Honey, the story.

47:50.628 --> 47:52.091
What... what's going
on with the story?

47:52.283 --> 47:53.511
You know, what happened with the

47:54.005 --> 47:54.849
Internet guy?

47:55.041 --> 47:56.864
What Internet guy?

47:57.056 --> 47:58.756
The guy that I gave $1,000 to

47:58.947 --> 48:00.402
because he knew
where Matthew was.

48:00.594 --> 48:01.074
That guy.

48:01.589 --> 48:01.824
Oh, yeah.

48:02.015 --> 48:02.581
Uh, that guy.

48:02.773 --> 48:04.650
Uh... Funny thing.

48:04.842 --> 48:07.458
People on the Internet... they

48:07.650 --> 48:08.377
aren't always honest.

48:08.404 --> 48:08.607
Huh.

48:08.799 --> 48:10.990
And I want to state for the

48:11.182 --> 48:13.326
record that I had my
doubts from the beginning.

48:13.518 --> 48:14.631
So, what else have you tried?

48:15.189 --> 48:15.547
What do you mean?

48:15.739 --> 48:16.852
Like, have I found Matthew?

48:17.044 --> 48:18.104
Is that what you're asking?

48:18.296 --> 48:19.713
'Cause, I mean, you said it...

48:19.905 --> 48:21.515
He may not even be out there.

48:21.706 --> 48:24.217
Did our conversation just
have no effect on you

48:24.692 --> 48:25.171
whatsoever?

48:25.311 --> 48:27.509
Because here's the deal, honey.

48:27.700 --> 48:29.666
I just... I cannot cover for you

48:29.858 --> 48:31.754
anymore while you self-destruct

48:31.946 --> 48:34.351
over some idiot
fucking musician.

48:34.543 --> 48:38.193
My magazine is on the line here.

48:38.385 --> 48:40.056
Okay, I need you to do three

48:40.248 --> 48:41.743
things, all right?

48:41.934 --> 48:43.874
Get your shit together.

48:44.065 --> 48:45.035
Find Matthew.

48:45.227 --> 48:48.233
Write a very good
story about it.

48:48.425 --> 48:50.901
Or what?

48:50.965 --> 48:52.816
You'll fire me?

48:53.008 --> 49:09.492
That's right.

49:12.372 --> 49:14.289
Hey. Come on in.

49:14.480 --> 49:16.756
I was just running.

49:17.429 --> 49:17.527
Really weird.

49:17.719 --> 49:18.199
It was good.

49:18.309 --> 49:19.775
The meeting was
really, really...

49:19.967 --> 49:21.587
Oh, God, yeah. What happened?

49:21.779 --> 49:24.202
I think, uh... I think I'm flying to L.A.
tomorrow, yeah.

49:24.394 --> 49:24.928
Oh, my God.

49:25.120 --> 49:26.600
And they want to set up a

49:26.792 --> 49:28.399
bunch of meetings and
shows and, uh...

49:28.591 --> 49:30.213
Wow! Ahh! That's amazing!

49:30.404 --> 49:30.884
Crazy!

49:30.959 --> 49:32.714
I cannot believe it.

49:32.906 --> 49:33.857
Wow. Wait.

49:34.049 --> 49:35.471
Uh, when... when
will you be back?

49:35.663 --> 49:37.884
Uh... I don't know.

49:38.076 --> 49:39.625
Oh, um... Charlie's wedding.

49:39.816 --> 49:40.296
Yeah.

49:40.310 --> 49:41.499
What... what day is it?

49:41.690 --> 49:42.171
Saturday.

49:42.363 --> 49:43.475
But he's gonna fly us over on

49:43.988 --> 49:44.221
Friday.

49:44.413 --> 49:45.307
So, that's fine.

49:45.499 --> 49:48.212
I'll just fly in and
meet you Saturday.

49:49.173 --> 49:49.652
Okay.

49:49.691 --> 49:50.995
Yeah. What was that?

49:51.956 --> 49:52.788
What?

49:52.853 --> 49:53.694
What was that?

49:53.885 --> 49:56.283
I'm gonna make the wedding.

49:56.475 --> 49:56.984
I know.

49:57.176 --> 49:57.679
I am.

49:57.871 --> 49:59.283
And I'm gonna call you every

49:59.668 --> 49:59.896
day.

50:00.088 --> 50:00.750
Okay.

50:00.942 --> 50:02.616
Name a day, any day.

50:02.807 --> 50:03.287
Monday.

50:03.432 --> 50:04.791
I'm gonna call you Monday.

50:04.983 --> 50:05.676
Name another day.

50:05.868 --> 50:06.430
Thursday.

50:06.622 --> 50:07.696
Yeah, Thursday's bad for me.

50:08.148 --> 50:08.628
Fuck you!

50:08.803 --> 50:11.606
I'm gonna call you Thursday.

50:11.797 --> 50:14.683
I'm glad we're back to work

50:14.875 --> 50:17.300
on the, uh, documentary.

50:17.492 --> 50:20.044
Nice to have the distraction.

50:20.236 --> 50:21.349
What's the latest on the, uh,

50:21.684 --> 50:22.164
wunderkind?

50:22.291 --> 50:23.499
I figured it out.

50:23.691 --> 50:26.837
I am the industry-wise
transition girlfriend to his

50:27.029 --> 50:29.762
soon-to-be model-fucking
teen heartthrob.

50:29.954 --> 50:33.000
Ooh. Your sentence.

50:33.192 --> 50:34.167
I'm sorry.

50:34.359 --> 50:36.699
This is, uh... well, this is the
house where Matthew grew up.

50:37.012 --> 50:38.228
Who do you think lives there

50:38.707 --> 50:38.880
now?

50:39.072 --> 50:40.490
Apparently, nobody.

50:40.682 --> 50:43.415
I mean, no one answered
when I knocked.

50:43.607 --> 50:45.652
I know how to break
into his room.

50:45.843 --> 50:48.203
Done that before.

50:48.394 --> 50:52.071
This used to be easier.

50:52.263 --> 50:56.179
There is a door here...
That's unlocked.

50:56.243 --> 51:00.116
Let's just... let's
go in this door.

51:00.180 --> 51:03.203
It's exactly as I remember it.

51:03.395 --> 51:07.051
It even smells the same.

51:07.242 --> 51:10.401
Luckily, for the documentary,

51:10.592 --> 51:16.372
I don't have smell-o-vision.

51:16.373 --> 51:18.974
This is where I
lost my virginity.

51:19.166 --> 51:20.275
Maybe that shouldn't go on

51:21.044 --> 51:21.524
record.

51:21.556 --> 51:23.225
Oh, no. That's great.

51:23.417 --> 51:25.464
That's just the kind of, uh,

51:25.656 --> 51:27.481
detail we're looking for in

51:27.673 --> 51:29.555
hard-hitting documentary
filmmaking.

51:29.747 --> 51:30.728
How was it?

51:30.920 --> 51:34.480
Eh. What do you expect
for the first time?

51:34.672 --> 51:35.572
How was yours?

51:35.764 --> 51:36.475
Oh, man.

51:36.667 --> 51:39.338
I lost my virginity
about 200 or 300 times.

51:39.529 --> 51:41.995
Uh... just answer the question.

51:42.187 --> 51:42.833
All right.

51:43.025 --> 51:44.876
If you must know, I was 14.

51:45.068 --> 51:47.604
It was our 46-year-old
Jamaican housekeeper.

51:47.795 --> 51:48.463
What?!

51:48.655 --> 51:50.196
She was very tender.

51:50.388 --> 51:52.339
She had a lot of moles.

51:52.531 --> 51:54.304
Okay, thank you.

51:54.496 --> 51:56.925
Hey, I'm gonna leave you and

51:57.116 --> 51:59.191
the ghost of Matthew
alone for a second.

51:59.383 --> 52:02.259
I got to pee.

52:15.124 --> 52:15.755
Holy shit.

52:15.947 --> 52:18.330
I don't know he had these.

52:18.522 --> 52:20.765
Hey, I just found a bunch
of issues of <i> stax.</i>

52:20.957 --> 52:23.057
<i>I think he was a subscriber from</i> I think
he was a subscriber from way back.

52:23.249 --> 52:27.528
His mom must have... shit.

52:27.719 --> 52:30.672
Ellie?

52:30.864 --> 52:31.753
Mr. Smith.

52:31.945 --> 52:33.776
What are you doing in my house?

52:33.967 --> 52:37.239
Uh, I just... I-I knocked on the
door, and there... there was

52:37.431 --> 52:39.234
no answer, so I...
So you broke in.

52:39.425 --> 52:42.292
Well, I thought you
might have moved or...

52:42.356 --> 52:44.184
Oh, for the love of God.

52:44.376 --> 52:48.883
Check it out... potty cam.

52:48.948 --> 52:50.151
Who the hell is this?

52:50.343 --> 52:51.604
This is, um... this is

52:52.277 --> 52:52.533
Charlie.

52:52.724 --> 52:55.782
He and I are making a
documentary together.

52:55.974 --> 52:56.511
A documentary?

52:57.012 --> 52:57.492
Oh. On that?

52:57.608 --> 53:00.225
This is cutting-edge
Japanese technology, sir.

53:00.417 --> 53:02.411
I am... I am so
sorry we broke in.

53:02.602 --> 53:03.892
Obviously, it was a very stupid

53:04.661 --> 53:04.892
idea.

53:05.084 --> 53:07.856
I just want to apologize again.

53:08.048 --> 53:11.935
I mean, it must be unpleasant to

53:12.127 --> 53:16.134
be reminded of everything.

53:16.325 --> 53:16.999
Yeah.

53:17.190 --> 53:20.705
You guys know the way.

53:20.897 --> 53:21.568
Yes.

53:21.760 --> 53:24.124
And you have a beautiful home.

53:24.316 --> 53:28.756
It's really lovely.

53:28.947 --> 53:29.901
He always hated me.

53:30.092 --> 53:30.742
Really? Why?

53:30.933 --> 53:32.199
Yeah. I don't know.

53:32.391 --> 53:35.261
He... he didn't want Matthew
to be famous, and I think he

53:35.452 --> 53:38.759
thought I encouraged Matthew
too much with his music.

53:38.951 --> 53:41.299
He held me responsible when...

53:41.491 --> 53:43.231
He rebelled and left home and,

53:43.423 --> 53:45.779
eventually, when he...

53:50.707 --> 53:51.827
Would you come back with me

53:52.628 --> 53:53.107
to my house?

53:53.227 --> 53:54.455
I have something for the wedding

53:54.612 --> 53:55.517
being delivered.

53:55.708 --> 53:56.500
Ooh! Your tux?

53:57.427 --> 53:57.699
No.

53:57.891 --> 53:59.228
The ring?

53:59.420 --> 53:59.899
No.

54:00.075 --> 54:01.823
What? Cake?

54:02.015 --> 54:02.539
No.

54:02.730 --> 54:04.019
Lingerie?

54:04.211 --> 54:04.758
No.

54:04.950 --> 54:06.579
What is it?

54:06.771 --> 54:08.273
$2,400. It's all there.

54:08.465 --> 54:10.988
Is it one of those things
you can't get water on?

54:11.180 --> 54:12.696
Uh, it's galagos bush baby.

54:12.888 --> 54:14.264
He's endangered, though, right?

54:14.456 --> 54:16.348
'Cause that's the
more expensive one?

54:16.540 --> 54:19.134
Yeah, it's a girl,
actually, but, yes.

54:19.326 --> 54:21.498
Does she get lonely in there?

54:21.690 --> 54:22.955
Galagos is not puppies.

54:23.147 --> 54:24.980
They don't want love.

54:25.172 --> 54:28.377
They just want to be left alone.

54:28.569 --> 54:41.587
Lucky them.

54:41.588 --> 54:44.082
Oh, Lucas, it's, uh...

54:44.274 --> 54:48.537
You-know-who calling you

54:48.729 --> 54:52.026
again... and again and again.

54:52.218 --> 54:55.390
Uh... just call me.

54:55.582 --> 55:01.492
When do you start serving?

55:03.476 --> 55:04.244
Good. Come in.

55:04.436 --> 55:05.588
Oh, you look so nice.

55:06.195 --> 55:06.674
Thank you.

55:06.752 --> 55:08.578
You look quite elegant yourself.

55:08.770 --> 55:10.243
Oh, yeah, that's me.

55:10.435 --> 55:11.944
Have a seat.

55:12.136 --> 55:14.607
What's happening?

55:14.798 --> 55:17.296
Oh. I just needed to talk

55:17.488 --> 55:20.126
about something before I
actually go through with this.

55:20.318 --> 55:22.064
I'm not a religious guy, so I

55:22.256 --> 55:24.819
hope you don't mind sitting
in for my confession.

55:25.011 --> 55:25.742
I'd be honored.

55:25.934 --> 55:26.891
It's dark and sordid.

55:27.083 --> 55:27.562
Really?

55:27.699 --> 55:28.582
No, not at all.

55:28.774 --> 55:29.713
I'm excited.

55:29.904 --> 55:32.441
You know, after I got

55:32.633 --> 55:35.443
divorced, I went through...

55:35.635 --> 55:38.263
A period of... failed
relationships.

55:38.455 --> 55:41.056
And now, recently, I see you and

55:41.248 --> 55:43.993
Lucas, realize that something's
missing in my life.

55:44.184 --> 55:46.014
So I did something out

55:46.206 --> 55:52.172
character, something
I'd never done before.

55:52.364 --> 55:55.276
I called an escort service.

55:55.468 --> 55:56.580
You'd never done that before?

55:56.712 --> 55:57.192
No, no.

55:57.299 --> 56:00.201
I was always too afraid that
something would go wrong.

56:00.393 --> 56:02.279
Worry about diseases or...
Of course.

56:02.470 --> 56:03.651
They're everywhere.

56:03.843 --> 56:05.766
No, it was more the
protocol of it all.

56:05.958 --> 56:08.021
If you don't take up all your

56:08.213 --> 56:11.335
time, do you get to snuggle
for the rest of the hour?

56:11.527 --> 56:13.797
Or if you need more
time, do you pay extra?

56:13.989 --> 56:15.534
If you run over, is there a

56:15.726 --> 56:18.003
bell, and they just
shove you off of them?

56:18.067 --> 56:18.770
There's a bell?

56:18.962 --> 56:21.178
As it turns out, there was

56:21.370 --> 56:23.181
not a bell, which was a relief.

56:23.373 --> 56:24.532
But one night...

56:24.596 --> 56:26.430
...there was a knock at the

56:26.622 --> 56:28.959
door, and I opened it.

56:29.151 --> 56:33.086
And... and there
stood Charlotte.

56:33.278 --> 56:33.757
Wow.

56:33.875 --> 56:36.151
I thought she was a socialite.

56:36.343 --> 56:37.340
Like, all the charity work

56:37.524 --> 56:39.592
and... she loves animals.

56:39.784 --> 56:41.003
She has a big heart.

56:41.195 --> 56:43.477
She wasn't cut out
for that life.

56:43.669 --> 56:45.721
She said that I was her first

56:45.913 --> 56:47.101
client as a prostitute.

56:47.293 --> 56:49.197
I'm not naive, but... yeah.

56:49.389 --> 56:53.872
Anyway, I love her.

56:54.064 --> 56:57.955
And, uh... I'm gonna marry her.

56:58.147 --> 56:59.334
I don't know, Ellie.

56:59.526 --> 57:01.363
I know I'm not a deep guy, but

57:01.555 --> 57:03.623
I'm not a shallow guy, either.

57:03.814 --> 57:05.689
Eh, what can I say?

57:05.881 --> 57:08.308
Life's pretty weird.

57:08.499 --> 57:10.175
I got to agree.

57:10.367 --> 57:12.452
So, here before your family

57:12.643 --> 57:14.565
and friends and everyone who

57:14.757 --> 57:16.934
knows you best, I pronounce

57:17.126 --> 57:18.552
you husband and wife.

57:18.744 --> 57:20.883
You may kiss the each other.

57:30.132 --> 57:30.963
Where's Lucas?

57:31.155 --> 57:33.793
I haven't heard from
him in two days.

57:33.985 --> 57:35.764
Well, just pick somebody out.

57:35.956 --> 57:38.771
There's a lot of guys here, a
lot of available man cake.

57:38.835 --> 57:40.183
You can do a lot of damage

57:40.375 --> 57:42.307
with some of these guys.

57:42.499 --> 57:43.254
Charlie.

57:43.446 --> 57:46.034
Come on. Piece of man cake.

57:46.099 --> 57:47.360
You see that big hunk of

57:47.551 --> 57:49.623
rock 'n' roll man back there?

57:49.815 --> 57:52.029
Are you calling him rock 'n'
roll because of his hair?

57:52.221 --> 57:54.349
No, seriously, that's
my buddy Craig.

57:54.541 --> 57:55.476
He's a good guy.

57:55.668 --> 57:56.788
I'll hook it up.

57:56.980 --> 57:58.216
No. Charlie, no.

57:58.408 --> 57:59.101
Why not?

57:59.293 --> 58:00.613
He's a good guy.

58:00.804 --> 58:01.883
You and Craig.

58:02.075 --> 58:03.084
Charlie, no.

58:03.276 --> 58:04.372
You and Craig.

58:04.564 --> 58:05.779
You and Craig!

58:05.971 --> 58:08.493
Yes, I have the jaw
of a superhero.

58:08.685 --> 58:11.743
Yes, I could light up a
dark room with my smile.

58:11.935 --> 58:14.275
Yes, I have the hair
of an '80s rock star.

58:14.467 --> 58:17.484
But this... this is what
I'm really proud of.

58:17.676 --> 58:18.669
This is God-given.

58:18.861 --> 58:21.801
I can't do anything about this,
but this, I feel, is... is

58:21.993 --> 58:25.135
something that I've... I've earned
through hard work and determination.

58:25.327 --> 58:27.821
And I'll tell you something else
that I think is going to impress

58:27.956 --> 58:28.167
you.

58:28.359 --> 58:29.817
What is that?

58:30.009 --> 58:32.576
I am 14 credits away from an

58:32.767 --> 58:34.560
online degree... from the

58:34.752 --> 58:36.362
university of Phoenix no less...

58:36.554 --> 58:37.244
To be a therapist.

58:37.491 --> 58:37.742
Wow.

58:37.934 --> 58:40.841
A licensed,
accredited therapist.

58:41.032 --> 58:43.603
Okay. I am gonna let you give
me a free like five-minute

58:44.276 --> 58:44.775
consultation.

58:44.904 --> 58:45.810
How do you feel about that?

58:45.907 --> 58:46.387
Oh, yeah.

58:46.541 --> 58:48.951
Okay, so, I have this

58:49.143 --> 58:51.564
boyfriend... or maybe <i> had.</i>

58:51.755 --> 58:53.223
And, uh, well, he was supposed

58:53.415 --> 58:55.027
to meet me here.

58:55.091 --> 58:56.780
But I think the gig is up.

58:56.972 --> 58:57.987
Ah! See?

58:58.179 --> 59:00.912
Now, why do you call it a gig?

59:01.104 --> 59:02.579
See, gig is a very
temporary term.

59:02.771 --> 59:04.713
It's very, uh, transient.

59:04.905 --> 59:06.698
It's here today, gone tomorrow.

59:06.890 --> 59:08.518
I think that you get on that

59:08.710 --> 59:10.610
stage knowing that you're going

59:10.802 --> 59:12.557
to get off that stage quickly.

59:12.749 --> 59:16.112
Quickly, like maybe after a

59:16.304 --> 59:19.245
couple of songs, hmm?

59:19.437 --> 59:22.613
Are we, uh... are
they still serving?

59:22.805 --> 59:26.373
I mean, either whiskey or cake

59:26.565 --> 59:29.088
or... something sweet.

59:29.280 --> 59:31.027
Oh, here we go.

59:31.091 --> 59:32.909
Charlie, what is this?

59:33.101 --> 59:35.298
Well, Charlotte, it's

59:35.490 --> 59:38.467
something that I know you've
always wanted and thought you

59:38.659 --> 59:41.034
would never, ever get
in this lifetime.

59:41.226 --> 59:42.822
From the galapagos islands in

59:43.014 --> 59:44.978
the South pacific...

59:46.419 --> 59:48.495
It's so beautiful!

59:48.687 --> 59:54.342
Oh, God. Is it dead?

59:54.534 --> 59:57.140
Oh.

01:00:02.708 --> 01:00:08.147
Oh, shit.

01:00:08.148 --> 01:00:10.836
Hey. Surprise.

01:00:10.900 --> 01:00:12.973
What are you doing here?

01:00:13.164 --> 01:00:17.026
Uh... this... this was our

01:00:17.217 --> 01:00:19.219
plan... I thought.

01:00:19.283 --> 01:00:21.586
You didn't... you
didn't even show.

01:00:21.778 --> 01:00:25.436
You didn't call me back.

01:00:25.628 --> 01:00:29.694
Yeah, well, I got held up.

01:00:29.886 --> 01:00:30.999
Well, some of us know some of

01:00:31.507 --> 01:00:32.530
us.

01:00:32.595 --> 01:00:34.704
Um, who is this?

01:00:34.895 --> 01:00:41.467
He's sort of my... therapist.

01:00:41.658 --> 01:00:42.273
Great.

01:00:42.465 --> 01:00:44.084
You two should probably talk.

01:00:44.979 --> 01:00:45.458
No, no, no.

01:00:45.478 --> 01:00:46.645
You stay right there.

01:00:46.836 --> 01:00:48.352
I mean, what could possibly be

01:00:48.543 --> 01:00:51.741
said that could make this any

01:00:51.933 --> 01:00:55.159
better, you know?

01:00:55.351 --> 01:00:59.443
Yeah, all right.

01:00:59.507 --> 01:01:03.648
So, I should stay?

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:08.116
No.

01:01:23.827 --> 01:01:27.208
Well, I heard about you and

01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:30.272
Lucas... and Craig.

01:01:30.464 --> 01:01:32.077
I don't even want
to talk about it.

01:01:32.269 --> 01:01:33.334
Look on the bright side.

01:01:33.526 --> 01:01:34.715
At least you didn't give a dead

01:01:34.836 --> 01:01:38.406
animal to somebody on
their wedding day.

01:01:38.598 --> 01:01:39.446
Guilty.

01:01:39.638 --> 01:01:41.043
Come on.

01:01:41.107 --> 01:01:41.816
It's a new day.

01:01:42.008 --> 01:01:43.899
You know what you need to do.

01:01:44.091 --> 01:01:45.165
You need to go back to work.

01:01:45.289 --> 01:01:48.392
Need to get started looking for
Matthew again, get back in the rv.

01:01:48.584 --> 01:01:50.137
Or, you know what?

01:01:50.329 --> 01:01:52.065
Just take a trip somewhere.

01:01:52.257 --> 01:01:52.817
It's on me.

01:01:53.009 --> 01:01:53.908
How about that?

01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:56.412
Charlie... that's
fucking ridiculous.

01:01:56.604 --> 01:01:57.639
I'm just trying to help you

01:01:58.003 --> 01:01:58.133
out.

01:01:58.325 --> 01:01:59.981
I know you feel bad about last

01:02:00.173 --> 01:02:02.859
night, and I'm... I just
want to be your friend.

01:02:03.051 --> 01:02:04.139
You're only my friend 'cause

01:02:04.331 --> 01:02:12.595
you had a thousand bucks
when I needed it.

01:02:12.596 --> 01:02:13.869
I didn't mean that.

01:02:14.061 --> 01:02:16.796
Came out the wrong way.

01:02:16.988 --> 01:02:18.950
Did it?

01:02:19.142 --> 01:02:48.642
Charlie... oh, fuck.
Charlie... pbht.

01:02:48.834 --> 01:02:53.713
"Ellie, I think we could have

01:02:53.904 --> 01:02:56.815
been something special,
but what's done is done.

01:02:57.007 --> 01:02:59.614
Here's the money you wouldn't

01:02:59.805 --> 01:03:01.638
let me return."

01:03:01.830 --> 01:03:02.843
Holy shit.

01:03:03.034 --> 01:03:04.307
"It paid for my demo, so thank

01:03:04.851 --> 01:03:05.016
you.

01:03:05.208 --> 01:03:06.229
Take care.

01:03:06.421 --> 01:03:08.595
Lucas."

01:03:08.659 --> 01:03:10.453
Ellie, your deadline came and

01:03:10.644 --> 01:03:12.149
went weeks ago.

01:03:12.341 --> 01:03:14.786
You know, this business,
it's fickle enough.

01:03:14.977 --> 01:03:18.005
I would be absolutely justified
never publishing another word

01:03:18.197 --> 01:03:19.478
from you, based on the way

01:03:19.670 --> 01:03:22.291
you've been screwing me around.

01:05:25.732 --> 01:05:26.211
Yeah.

01:05:26.514 --> 01:05:26.642
Yeah.

01:05:26.834 --> 01:05:29.366
No, this is what I
was worried about.

01:05:29.558 --> 01:05:30.931
What?

01:05:31.123 --> 01:05:32.850
No guy, just you wallowing.

01:05:34.387 --> 01:05:34.636
I'm working!

01:05:34.827 --> 01:05:36.722
I was getting so close
to figuring this out.

01:05:36.914 --> 01:05:37.835
Okay, what is this shit?

01:05:38.022 --> 01:05:38.502
This song.

01:05:38.675 --> 01:05:39.550
It's Matthew. It is.

01:05:39.742 --> 01:05:41.698
And he's singing... singing about me...
I mean, us.

01:05:41.867 --> 01:05:42.665
Listen.

01:05:42.857 --> 01:05:45.744
♪ I'll be sailing on your... ♪

01:05:45.936 --> 01:05:48.306
I tracked the I.P. Address
where this e-mail came from,

01:05:48.498 --> 01:05:50.838
when the guy sent me this, but
it's just some fucking library

01:05:50.995 --> 01:05:51.276
computer.

01:05:51.468 --> 01:05:52.463
And I just... ugh!

01:05:52.655 --> 01:05:55.571
I know that I'm just not
thinking of something.

01:05:55.763 --> 01:05:57.201
I mean, he's out there, singing

01:05:57.393 --> 01:06:01.266
about me, wanting
me to find him.

01:06:01.330 --> 01:06:04.597
Okay, but, Ellie, don't you
think he'd just call you?

01:06:04.789 --> 01:06:05.811
Him?

01:06:05.875 --> 01:06:07.410
No.

01:06:07.474 --> 01:06:12.371
God. He was such a dick.

01:06:12.372 --> 01:06:16.236
Hey, listen... don't...
Fuck you.

01:06:16.428 --> 01:06:17.426
Oh, wait. Fuck me?

01:06:17.618 --> 01:06:18.400
Yeah, fuck you.

01:06:18.592 --> 01:06:20.070
Oh, all right, cool.

01:06:20.262 --> 01:06:22.840
Um, listen... you need to stop

01:06:23.032 --> 01:06:23.667
this shit, okay?

01:06:24.531 --> 01:06:25.010
Excuse me.

01:06:25.043 --> 01:06:26.290
Hey. I am working.

01:06:26.482 --> 01:06:27.827
Okay, it's not work, all right?

01:06:28.019 --> 01:06:30.166
You're in crazy town!

01:06:30.358 --> 01:06:31.051
Listen to me.

01:06:31.243 --> 01:06:31.722
Listen!

01:06:31.871 --> 01:06:34.322
All right, you
have to stop this.

01:06:34.514 --> 01:06:35.164
Okay.

01:06:35.355 --> 01:06:37.557
Please, please, please let go,

01:06:37.749 --> 01:06:39.664
please let go, please let go!

01:06:39.856 --> 01:06:41.334
I want you to look at him...

01:06:41.526 --> 01:06:43.373
Okay?... and remember him for

01:06:43.565 --> 01:06:45.562
the shithead that he was.

01:06:45.754 --> 01:06:46.419
Is!

01:06:46.611 --> 01:06:57.938
Was/is.

01:06:57.939 --> 01:06:59.860
Holy shit.

01:07:00.052 --> 01:07:01.264
Yeah.

01:07:01.456 --> 01:07:02.963
Holy fucking shit.

01:07:03.155 --> 01:07:03.923
Yeah, tough stuff.

01:07:04.434 --> 01:07:04.721
I love you.

01:07:04.913 --> 01:07:06.285
I love you, too.

01:07:06.477 --> 01:07:07.714
Oh, my God.

01:07:07.906 --> 01:07:16.306
Wait. What?

01:07:39.794 --> 01:07:57.043
Oh, God.

01:07:57.043 --> 01:07:58.867
Where's Charlotte?

01:07:59.058 --> 01:08:07.281
Have a seat.

01:08:07.282 --> 01:08:09.336
Before you apologize... and I

01:08:09.528 --> 01:08:12.083
assume that's why you're here...

01:08:12.275 --> 01:08:14.605
I have something I'd
like to say to you.

01:08:14.797 --> 01:08:15.490
Okay.

01:08:15.681 --> 01:08:17.600
I only had good
intentions toward you.

01:08:17.791 --> 01:08:20.314
I didn't deserve to be treated
the way I was treated.

01:08:20.506 --> 01:08:21.469
I know, I know.

01:08:21.661 --> 01:08:23.711
I... I was totally out of line.

01:08:23.903 --> 01:08:25.331
Sometimes I can be a jackass.

01:08:25.523 --> 01:08:26.139
Mm. Yeah.

01:08:26.331 --> 01:08:28.517
I wasn't necessarily asking

01:08:28.709 --> 01:08:29.898
you to agree with that specific

01:08:30.196 --> 01:08:30.707
point.

01:08:30.899 --> 01:08:33.915
I am really sorry, Charlie.

01:08:34.107 --> 01:08:34.880
Really sorry.

01:08:35.072 --> 01:08:36.296
Thank you.

01:08:36.488 --> 01:08:38.144
I believe you.

01:08:38.336 --> 01:08:39.854
So, you asked about Charlotte.

01:08:40.046 --> 01:08:40.524
Yeah.

01:08:40.587 --> 01:08:43.035
Yeah, well, Charlotte
and I are done.

01:08:43.227 --> 01:08:44.626
Wow. What happened?

01:08:44.818 --> 01:08:46.035
We had some issues.

01:08:46.227 --> 01:08:47.752
What kind of issues?

01:08:47.944 --> 01:08:49.254
You know, "issues."

01:08:49.444 --> 01:08:50.526
You couldn't get it up?

01:08:50.718 --> 01:08:52.658
Why is that always
the assumption?

01:08:52.850 --> 01:08:53.330
No.

01:08:53.481 --> 01:08:55.193
I could get it up.

01:08:55.385 --> 01:08:57.596
But there were some
bigger issues.

01:08:57.788 --> 01:08:58.779
Like what?

01:08:58.971 --> 01:09:01.475
That she was already married.

01:09:01.666 --> 01:09:02.145
No.

01:09:02.331 --> 01:09:03.796
Yeah.

01:09:03.987 --> 01:09:05.131
Wow.

01:09:05.322 --> 01:09:08.433
I don't know... what to say.

01:09:08.625 --> 01:09:10.120
There's no logic to love.

01:09:10.312 --> 01:09:12.419
It's just a painful, brutal

01:09:12.611 --> 01:09:14.997
process of trial and error.

01:09:15.189 --> 01:09:17.892
And you just go through it again

01:09:18.084 --> 01:09:20.723
and again and again.

01:09:20.913 --> 01:09:24.481
And again and again and again.

01:09:24.673 --> 01:09:25.434
And again.

01:09:25.626 --> 01:09:28.828
Well, I think I might have something...
that will take your

01:09:29.020 --> 01:09:31.548
mind off Charlotte for a
little while, at least.

01:09:31.740 --> 01:09:33.139
Okay.

01:09:35.642 --> 01:09:37.792
Think I've... I
really found him.

01:09:37.983 --> 01:09:39.081
"Him"?

01:09:39.272 --> 01:09:40.210
Matthew.

01:09:40.402 --> 01:09:41.171
Matthew?

01:09:41.363 --> 01:09:42.354
Really?

01:09:42.546 --> 01:09:46.240
Mm-hmm. I've rented a car.

01:09:46.432 --> 01:09:51.343
And I would very much
appreciate your help.

01:09:51.535 --> 01:09:57.107
I'm ready to hit the road again.

01:09:57.108 --> 01:10:00.297
Okay. Remember in Matthew's
house, he had all these back

01:10:00.489 --> 01:10:01.065
issues of <i> stax?</i>

01:10:01.330 --> 01:10:01.426
Mm.

01:10:01.618 --> 01:10:04.728
Right? So, according to the subscriber
database, it's never been dropped.

01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:06.579
Just the address was
changed to the bar.

01:10:06.771 --> 01:10:09.406
So, his mom got him the
subscription back in high

01:10:09.598 --> 01:10:11.038
school, but I think he's just

01:10:11.229 --> 01:10:13.158
kept it in her name
all this time.

01:10:13.350 --> 01:10:14.589
Mm. Huh.

01:10:14.781 --> 01:10:15.443
This is good.

01:10:15.635 --> 01:10:17.055
This is good investigative
journalism.

01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:17.787
Good.

01:10:17.979 --> 01:10:19.730
Why, thank you.

01:10:19.922 --> 01:10:21.652
You're welcome.

01:10:21.844 --> 01:10:23.219
Check these out.

01:10:23.411 --> 01:10:25.530
Got them on an online spy store.

01:10:25.722 --> 01:10:26.201
See?

01:10:26.354 --> 01:10:29.180
A camera and a microphone.

01:10:29.372 --> 01:10:32.436
And no matter what I look at,
you can see it on the screen.

01:10:32.628 --> 01:10:33.700
Like, look.

01:10:33.892 --> 01:10:40.308
Gonna pan right...
And then pan left.

01:10:40.499 --> 01:10:41.420
Stop looking at my tits.

01:10:41.619 --> 01:10:41.722
Okay.

01:10:41.914 --> 01:10:43.448
I just happened to be
looking over there.

01:10:43.574 --> 01:10:46.418
I was... I like your scarf.

01:10:46.482 --> 01:10:47.970
How is it you don't like music?

01:10:48.162 --> 01:10:51.046
It's not so much that
I don't like music.

01:10:51.238 --> 01:10:53.576
Um... it's just
hard to find a song

01:10:53.768 --> 01:10:55.164
that doesn't annoy me.

01:10:55.356 --> 01:10:57.058
Well, what do you like?

01:10:57.250 --> 01:10:59.453
I remember liking a
Canadian artist.

01:10:59.645 --> 01:11:00.182
Leonard Cohen?

01:11:00.563 --> 01:11:00.714
No.

01:11:00.906 --> 01:11:01.900
Neil young?

01:11:02.092 --> 01:11:02.365
No.

01:11:02.556 --> 01:11:03.600
Rufus Wainwright?

01:11:03.792 --> 01:11:04.020
No.

01:11:04.212 --> 01:11:07.493
Okay. So, listen, when we're finished
with all this, you should come over to my

01:11:07.685 --> 01:11:08.653
apartment, and I'll... I'll play

01:11:08.845 --> 01:11:11.218
you some stuff. I'll...
Bryan Adams.

01:11:11.410 --> 01:11:12.290
Bryan Adams.

01:11:12.481 --> 01:11:14.422
I remember, on the album cover,

01:11:14.613 --> 01:11:16.711
he's doing this... this pose,

01:11:16.903 --> 01:11:19.779
like a guy... like, running
across the street.

01:11:19.971 --> 01:11:21.267
I thought that was kind of cool.

01:11:21.459 --> 01:11:22.230
Mm. Mm.

01:11:22.422 --> 01:11:25.886
Well, that's it. That's a start.

01:11:26.078 --> 01:11:26.557
Wait.

01:11:26.724 --> 01:11:29.056
Someone's going in.

01:11:29.247 --> 01:11:31.407
Oh, yeah, it's the bartender.

01:11:31.599 --> 01:11:32.098
Should we go?

01:11:32.197 --> 01:11:34.578
No, no, no. Just give her...

01:11:34.770 --> 01:11:37.042
Give her a few minutes.

01:11:37.234 --> 01:11:40.146
I have been thinking,
what was our sentence?

01:11:40.882 --> 01:11:40.968
Hmm?

01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:43.521
What was our sentence
when we were dating?

01:11:43.713 --> 01:11:44.863
I know... two dates doesn't...

01:11:44.939 --> 01:11:49.148
It doesn't really count
as dating anyway.

01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:50.953
Anyway, let's go.

01:11:51.145 --> 01:11:51.951
We should probably...

01:11:53.906 --> 01:11:54.090
First?

01:11:54.282 --> 01:11:55.259
I think you should.

01:11:55.451 --> 01:11:57.484
And, you know, settle in,
and then I'll wander in.

01:11:57.676 --> 01:11:59.097
She won't know we're together.

01:11:59.289 --> 01:12:00.494
Okay. All right.

01:12:00.686 --> 01:12:02.702
Remember, I'm filming.

01:12:02.893 --> 01:12:09.939
How could I forget?

01:12:10.675 --> 01:12:10.884
Hi.

01:12:11.076 --> 01:12:14.034
What can I get you?

01:12:14.098 --> 01:12:16.386
Could I get a clean glass, a

01:12:16.578 --> 01:12:21.187
bottle of water, and a
whole lime, please?

01:12:21.379 --> 01:12:23.139
A whole lime?

01:12:23.331 --> 01:12:42.323
Please.

01:12:48.114 --> 01:12:48.269
Hey.

01:12:48.461 --> 01:12:50.554
I'm actually looking
for someone.

01:12:50.746 --> 01:12:52.908
I was hoping you could help me.

01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:55.458
His name's Matthew...
Matthew Smith.

01:12:55.650 --> 01:12:56.524
Matthew Smith?

01:12:56.716 --> 01:12:57.327
Mm-hmm.

01:12:57.518 --> 01:12:58.952
Matthew Smith...

01:12:59.144 --> 01:13:00.926
Isn't that the dude that killed

01:13:01.118 --> 01:13:03.271
himself over at the falls?

01:13:03.463 --> 01:13:05.844
Well, I mean... yeah, but...
He...

01:13:06.036 --> 01:13:07.335
I was told, you know, he used to

01:13:07.527 --> 01:13:11.042
play here a lot and...
Probably. I...

01:13:11.234 --> 01:13:12.898
I don't know.

01:13:13.089 --> 01:13:13.569
Sorry.

01:13:13.811 --> 01:13:13.987
Okay.

01:13:14.179 --> 01:13:16.856
No, no. Thanks.

01:13:17.048 --> 01:13:21.491
Thanks anyway.

01:13:32.595 --> 01:13:35.155
Hey.

01:13:35.347 --> 01:13:38.912
Yeah.

01:13:39.103 --> 01:13:43.347
I'm just gonna mosey along.

01:14:06.227 --> 01:14:08.458
There she is.

01:14:08.649 --> 01:14:21.426
Let's go.

01:14:21.427 --> 01:14:24.101
You're really good at this.

01:14:42.323 --> 01:14:43.282
You know that last night,

01:14:43.387 --> 01:14:46.176
when they found his
car out by the falls?

01:14:46.367 --> 01:14:49.625
I fucking... I just drove
out there like a maniac.

01:14:49.817 --> 01:14:51.970
And I stood there with the cops,

01:14:52.162 --> 01:14:53.184
just waiting.

01:14:53.376 --> 01:14:58.099
I feel like that's
what I'm still doing.

01:14:58.291 --> 01:15:01.437
So... should we wait
a little longer?

01:15:01.629 --> 01:15:03.901
Just until the morning?

01:15:04.092 --> 01:15:07.284
Yeah, it's much better to
confront the demons of your past

01:15:07.476 --> 01:15:09.385
in the harsh, unforgiving light

01:15:09.577 --> 01:15:11.150
of early dawn.

01:15:11.342 --> 01:15:12.097
Yeah.

01:15:12.288 --> 01:15:14.750
Definitely.

01:15:14.942 --> 01:15:17.203
Yeah.

01:15:17.394 --> 01:15:23.332
So... we have this item.

01:15:23.524 --> 01:15:26.787
This is an ancient weapon,

01:15:26.979 --> 01:15:29.922
purely designed to protect you
from the detritus of your

01:15:30.114 --> 01:15:31.538
relationships past.

01:15:31.603 --> 01:15:33.279
It's a powerful weapon.

01:15:33.471 --> 01:15:37.006
Do you require a demonstration?

01:15:37.198 --> 01:15:40.527
So... mm. Mm!

01:15:40.719 --> 01:15:41.671
Mmmm!

01:15:41.863 --> 01:15:44.729
It makes your face light up like

01:15:44.921 --> 01:15:46.663
Satan's concubine.

01:15:46.855 --> 01:15:49.586
You are so weird.

01:16:13.138 --> 01:16:14.811
Ellie.

01:16:15.003 --> 01:16:20.024
Ellie, wake up.

01:16:20.216 --> 01:16:24.914
Is that Matthew?

01:16:24.915 --> 01:16:26.230
Is that him?

01:16:31.026 --> 01:16:32.909
I can't tell.

01:16:33.101 --> 01:16:37.163
What do you want to do?

01:16:37.354 --> 01:16:41.234
Do you want to go?

01:16:41.298 --> 01:16:45.843
No.

01:16:45.907 --> 01:16:52.146
This is... this is weird now.

01:16:52.210 --> 01:16:54.267
Are you okay?

01:16:54.459 --> 01:16:56.114
Yeah.

01:16:56.306 --> 01:17:22.642
Yeah.

01:17:40.594 --> 01:17:42.204
Well...

01:17:50.835 --> 01:17:52.630
Please turn the camera off.

01:17:57.426 --> 01:17:59.702
Thank you.

01:18:03.538 --> 01:18:11.474
Hi.

01:18:11.539 --> 01:18:18.962
What... oh, God.

01:18:19.026 --> 01:18:30.707
I... I don't even...

01:18:30.899 --> 01:18:40.337
Hey, Matthew, we're gonna go...
Oh.

01:18:40.338 --> 01:18:45.903
Sara, this is Ellie.

01:18:46.095 --> 01:18:47.434
Hi.

01:18:47.626 --> 01:18:50.062
Hey, there.

01:18:50.254 --> 01:18:58.417
I'm Charlie.

01:18:58.418 --> 01:19:06.591
I, uh... I saw your dad.

01:19:06.783 --> 01:19:08.427
Wow.

01:19:08.619 --> 01:19:10.340
Yeah.

01:19:10.532 --> 01:19:16.032
I haven't seen him in
a long, long time.

01:19:16.224 --> 01:19:21.192
I don't think he was
very happy to see me.

01:19:21.384 --> 01:19:24.085
He's not very happy.

01:19:24.277 --> 01:19:26.218
I heard your... your new song.

01:19:26.410 --> 01:19:27.413
Heard the new song?

01:19:27.605 --> 01:19:29.574
Yeah, you played at a bar

01:19:29.766 --> 01:19:32.382
around here somewhere.

01:19:32.574 --> 01:19:33.119
No.

01:19:33.310 --> 01:19:44.529
No new songs.

01:19:44.530 --> 01:19:45.718
You look great, kid.

01:19:49.555 --> 01:19:51.936
So, do you guys... want to

01:19:52.128 --> 01:19:55.877
come in for coffee or something?

01:19:56.068 --> 01:19:59.451
I would really enjoy
some delicious coffee.

01:19:59.643 --> 01:20:00.997
Thank you.

01:20:01.189 --> 01:20:02.873
We can't stay.

01:20:03.065 --> 01:20:05.895
We can't stay, actually.

01:20:06.086 --> 01:20:15.856
It's really nice to meet you.

01:20:15.857 --> 01:20:17.416
Bye, Matthew.

01:20:39.474 --> 01:20:42.086
We can go to the park.

01:20:42.278 --> 01:20:45.044
Yeah? Yeah? Yes?

01:20:45.235 --> 01:20:47.087
You all right?

01:20:47.279 --> 01:20:47.988
Yeah.

01:20:48.180 --> 01:20:49.989
Talk about it in a sec.

01:20:50.181 --> 01:20:51.101
Yeah, yeah.

01:20:51.293 --> 01:21:18.098
Yeah, you're heavy.

01:21:18.099 --> 01:21:22.148
You may want to hang on to this.

01:21:22.340 --> 01:21:27.179
Everything's still
in it that I shot.

01:21:27.371 --> 01:21:40.337
If you want it, you can have it.

01:21:43.091 --> 01:21:46.125
♪ I'm gonna run to you ♪

01:21:46.317 --> 01:21:50.792
♪ yeah, I'm gonna run to you ♪

01:21:50.983 --> 01:21:51.602
♪ 'cause when the feeling's

01:21:52.017 --> 01:21:55.308
right ♪ ♪ I'm gonna stay all night ♪

01:21:55.500 --> 01:21:57.420
♪ I'm gonna run to you ♪

01:21:57.612 --> 01:21:59.891
We all have someone
like Matthew Smith.

01:22:00.083 --> 01:22:02.054
We spend thousands of hours

01:22:02.245 --> 01:22:03.989
wondering, imagining, and

01:22:04.181 --> 01:22:06.037
re-creating our time with them.

01:22:06.228 --> 01:22:08.413
We look backwards to
avoid going forwards.

01:22:08.605 --> 01:22:10.151
But at a certain point, it's

01:22:10.343 --> 01:22:12.916
time to stop singing that old

01:22:13.108 --> 01:22:15.840
song and write a new tune.

01:22:16.032 --> 01:22:18.646
I'd be... pretty
embarrassed to walk in

01:22:18.838 --> 01:22:19.925
here if I were you.

01:22:20.117 --> 01:22:21.045
Your deadline?

01:22:21.237 --> 01:22:22.850
It came and went weeks ago.

01:22:23.042 --> 01:22:26.383
I had to push a total piece-of-shit
story to the cover because of you.

01:22:26.574 --> 01:22:27.948
I need people I can
rely on, Ellie.

01:22:28.140 --> 01:22:31.126
This business is fickle enough.

01:22:31.318 --> 01:22:33.027
I mean, your story, it's...
It was okay.

01:22:33.219 --> 01:22:34.469
It was pretty good.

01:22:34.661 --> 01:22:35.917
It's good.

01:22:36.109 --> 01:22:40.062
You know, it's very good.

01:22:40.254 --> 01:22:43.202
I recognize this... this chick.

01:22:43.394 --> 01:22:45.586
Are you sure you want to reveal
this much about yourself?

01:22:45.778 --> 01:22:47.253
It's just as much about your

01:22:47.445 --> 01:22:48.896
defects as it is about Matthew.

01:22:49.088 --> 01:22:50.546
I mean, it's like a
goddamn confession.

01:22:50.704 --> 01:22:54.673
Yeah, well, I've...
I've decided to...

01:22:54.865 --> 01:22:57.756
Embrace my defects, so...

01:22:57.947 --> 01:22:58.715
Part of the package.

01:22:58.893 --> 01:23:01.746
I got to admit, you really had
me going with all that, you

01:23:01.938 --> 01:23:03.737
know, "Matthew is alive" stuff.

01:23:03.929 --> 01:23:06.973
Yeah, well, we can all close
the book on that one now.

01:23:07.165 --> 01:23:08.818
So, I'm thinking about using

01:23:09.010 --> 01:23:12.055
it to, um... launch our
first digital issue.

01:23:12.247 --> 01:23:13.069
Wait. What?

01:23:13.260 --> 01:23:15.649
Oh, yeah. The last paper edition
went out last month, but

01:23:15.841 --> 01:23:18.000
I know that you're not concerned

01:23:18.192 --> 01:23:22.290
with such mundane... matters.

01:23:22.354 --> 01:23:24.509
Did I tell you that they want

01:23:24.701 --> 01:23:27.867
me to add a lifestyle section?

01:23:28.058 --> 01:23:32.241
What does that even mean?

01:23:32.242 --> 01:23:35.058
I have no fucking idea.

01:23:35.123 --> 01:23:36.009
I'm serious.
