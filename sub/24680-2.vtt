00:02.135 --> 00:05.171
In New York City's war on crime,

00:05.171 --> 00:08.080
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:08.080 --> 00:09.609
of the Major Case Squad.

00:09.609 --> 00:12.407
These are their stories.

00:14.701 --> 00:17.701
I can't believe what I'm seeing.

00:17.715 --> 00:20.715
It looks like I was born with it.

00:22.073 --> 00:24.377
Arnie, is this as blue as they come?

00:24.377 --> 00:25.762
Any bluer, you'd look like you

00:25.762 --> 00:28.870
escaped from the Marilyn Manson tour.

00:31.602 --> 00:34.481
So how do you like the new you?

00:45.201 --> 00:47.346
Finally.

00:48.310 --> 00:50.995
Wait!

00:50.995 --> 00:53.064
Come on.

00:53.064 --> 00:55.513
My only obligation is to give you that.

00:55.513 --> 00:57.904
I don't actually have to talk to you.

00:57.904 --> 01:00.251
Well, I have something for you.

01:01.055 --> 01:03.066
What's this?

01:03.066 --> 01:05.001
Hold on to it.

01:05.001 --> 01:07.943
You'll know when to open it.

01:13.636 --> 01:15.353
Excuse me, sir.

01:15.353 --> 01:17.928
Please don't mark up the library books.

01:17.928 --> 01:19.686
I'm sorry. I...

01:19.686 --> 01:20.978
Just don't do it again.

01:20.978 --> 01:23.663
We're closing now.

01:23.663 --> 01:26.663
Well, at least with you,
people know where they stand.

01:26.722 --> 01:29.293
Really, and why is that?

01:30.566 --> 01:33.121
With your dark skin, your full lips,

01:33.121 --> 01:35.203
your natural hair.

01:35.203 --> 01:37.840
You're from the other side of the ring.

01:41.555 --> 01:43.293
I just wanna get rid of the bump.

01:43.293 --> 01:44.659
It's been broken a couple of times,

01:44.659 --> 01:47.659
and I'm tired of looking at it.

01:48.133 --> 01:50.155
Excuse me.

02:01.483 --> 02:03.772
There's so many people.

02:03.772 --> 02:06.914
All of a sudden, there's so many people.

02:09.054 --> 02:11.593
The market's just closed.

02:12.214 --> 02:15.681
Okay, angel, I have appointments.

02:18.460 --> 02:20.688
This looks like too much.

02:20.688 --> 02:23.466
That might be it for a while.

02:25.589 --> 02:28.021
Don't let 'em change you.

02:28.021 --> 02:30.331
Promise me.

02:30.331 --> 02:32.680
Why fix what's not broken?

02:40.140 --> 02:43.140
Mrs. Paulsen said she'd be in early
this morning to pick up her glasses.

02:43.815 --> 02:46.370
Make sure that prescription's right this time.

02:46.370 --> 02:48.456
Whatever you say, Arnie.

02:48.456 --> 02:50.977
Stupid lab.

02:50.977 --> 02:55.577
Arnie, those idiots did it again.

02:57.259 --> 02:59.637
Mother of God. Arnie?

02:59.637 --> 03:01.946
Help.! Help.! Call the police.!

03:01.946 --> 03:04.337
They shot him.!

3x02 The Gift

03:45.207 --> 03:47.784
ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC:  2003/10/12

03:50.651 --> 03:52.114
Eyeglass store.

03:52.114 --> 03:54.352
Clerk shot in the face with a nine-mil.

03:54.352 --> 03:56.120
Everything's the same as in Sunset Park.

03:56.120 --> 03:58.390
Sunset Park was written up as a robbery attempt.

03:58.390 --> 03:59.464
Anything taken here?

03:59.464 --> 04:00.759
No.

04:00.759 --> 04:03.098
Well, maybe they saw him in the back and got spooked.

04:03.098 --> 04:06.098
It's a theory. Thanks.

04:09.470 --> 04:11.215
Uh,

04:11.215 --> 04:14.215
he was cleaning frames over here.

04:15.437 --> 04:18.437
For some reason, he stopped and came over here.

04:21.413 --> 04:24.413
Uh, the entrance wound is just below his eye.

04:25.142 --> 04:28.142
The exit wound is at the base of the skull.

04:29.272 --> 04:31.042
The killer shot down.

04:31.042 --> 04:33.817
Arnie was looking up.

04:33.817 --> 04:36.817
Maybe he was looking through this drawer.

04:38.509 --> 04:41.509
Travel cases, cleaning solution, contact lenses.

04:48.475 --> 04:50.018
Excuse me.

04:50.018 --> 04:52.871
In the mornings, he straightens up out here,

04:52.871 --> 04:54.254
you went in the back?

04:54.254 --> 04:57.254
Every morning for two years.

04:58.084 --> 05:01.084
Killer must have had front-row seats.

05:01.897 --> 05:03.335
Couple of doorways there.

05:03.335 --> 05:04.696
Pay phone.

05:04.696 --> 05:07.367
Not too many coops for a stakeout.

05:07.367 --> 05:10.176
Another eyeglass store there.

05:10.176 --> 05:12.105
This one here, you can see right in.

05:12.105 --> 05:14.402
Anybody walking by.

05:14.402 --> 05:16.609
That one over there,
you can't even see in the store.

05:16.609 --> 05:18.276
It's a better candidate for a holdup.

05:18.276 --> 05:21.276
Then why didn't they hold it up?

05:21.742 --> 05:23.489
I heard it was Arnie.

05:23.489 --> 05:25.278
It's awful, two stores in a week.

05:25.278 --> 05:26.267
Who's doing this?

05:26.267 --> 05:27.688
We're not sure.

05:27.688 --> 05:29.209
You work here alone?

05:29.209 --> 05:31.590
In the mornings. My wife comes in after12:00.

05:31.590 --> 05:32.825
Expensive frames.

05:32.825 --> 05:34.451
Same as across the street.

05:34.451 --> 05:35.788
Well, maybe the same price range,

05:35.788 --> 05:38.788
but our selection's entirely different.

05:39.076 --> 05:40.640
No contacts.

05:40.640 --> 05:42.548
You don't carry contact lenses.

05:42.548 --> 05:44.724
Profit margin's too small.

05:44.724 --> 05:47.086
Excuse me.

05:47.086 --> 05:48.900
You could throw a disco party in this place,

05:48.900 --> 05:50.793
and no one passing by would even notice.

05:50.793 --> 05:52.723
This is the better target.

05:52.723 --> 05:55.206
Well, it depends on what the killer's after.

05:55.206 --> 05:58.206
We need to take another look at
the killer's first target in Sunset Park.

06:02.294 --> 06:03.816
Thursdays I'm in business school,

06:03.816 --> 06:06.772
so Dad was in the store alone.

06:06.772 --> 06:08.333
Fifteen years in the same location,

06:08.333 --> 06:11.173
wiped out like that.

06:11.173 --> 06:14.173
Um, was this ad always there?

06:14.451 --> 06:15.692
Yeah.

06:15.692 --> 06:18.692
Dad didn't like shoving ads
in the customers' faces.

06:20.462 --> 06:23.462
The day he was shot, it was
on the counter here next to his body.

06:25.013 --> 06:28.013
I must've moved it back after we cleaned up.

06:30.808 --> 06:32.883
There's no blood spatter on it.

06:32.883 --> 06:34.018
The way he was shot,

06:34.018 --> 06:37.018
there should've been blood.

06:37.033 --> 06:40.033
Or the ad was moved to the counter after he was killed...

06:41.809 --> 06:43.859
Where we wouldn't miss it.

06:43.859 --> 06:46.859
The same as the other store.

06:48.309 --> 06:50.199
He's trying to make a point.

06:50.199 --> 06:52.028
"Make your brown eyes blue,

06:52.028 --> 06:54.568
VisionStyle."

06:54.568 --> 06:57.130
Visionstyle Corporation
Yonkeyrs, New York
Monday, April 7

06:57.130 --> 07:00.130
Those are all the letters we've received
since we launched our ad campaign.

07:01.029 --> 07:04.029
Well, someone's curious if you made
blue contacts for Marilyn Monroe.

07:04.871 --> 07:06.109
We didn't.

07:06.109 --> 07:08.644
But it goes to show we enjoy a good reputation.

07:08.644 --> 07:11.644
That's why it's premature
to link these murders to VisionStyle.

07:12.522 --> 07:13.689
It's just a theory.

07:13.689 --> 07:16.549
But if our retailers buy into your theory that

07:16.549 --> 07:18.535
carrying our products can get them killed...

07:18.535 --> 07:20.943
We get it. You sank a lot of money into your campaign.

07:20.943 --> 07:22.236
Your company's struggling.

07:22.236 --> 07:24.078
You had layoffs.

07:24.078 --> 07:26.466
Anybody do exit interviews with these employees

07:26.466 --> 07:28.104
before you put 'em out on the street?

07:28.104 --> 07:30.820
No. But they know the layoffs are temporary.

07:30.820 --> 07:33.820
Uh, here's one citizen who hopes to make your problems permanent.

07:37.754 --> 07:39.870
"Any company that promotes the belief that

07:39.870 --> 07:42.404
blue eyes are superior to other eye colors...

07:42.404 --> 07:45.404
"deserves to join the slave trader and shackle maker...

07:46.850 --> 07:49.850
on the junk heap of racist profiteers."

07:52.596 --> 07:54.314
This is the slow time now,

07:54.314 --> 07:56.705
but later, I get very busy.

07:56.705 --> 07:58.981
I'm always the last one here in the evenings.

07:58.981 --> 08:01.362
It's terrible what they make you do.

08:01.362 --> 08:03.521
These chemicals, they're not good for you.

08:03.521 --> 08:05.994
That's why I always wear gloves.

08:05.994 --> 08:08.994
Now, let's take a look.

08:15.688 --> 08:18.688
So, you like it?

08:18.710 --> 08:21.710
It's a new you.

08:22.419 --> 08:25.419
A new me.

08:27.388 --> 08:29.451
Douglass High School
Bronx, New York
Wendesday, April 9

08:29.451 --> 08:32.451
Do you think VisionStyle's
turning them all into Barbies and Kens?

08:32.678 --> 08:34.738
I'm not paranoid, Detective.

08:34.738 --> 08:37.738
But you know as a biologist
of certain traits like blue eyes...

08:38.249 --> 08:40.932
become perceived as socially advantageous, then most...

08:40.932 --> 08:43.789
Then those are the traits that become dominant.

08:43.789 --> 08:46.789
Especially when parents can choose their unborn child's eye color.

08:47.458 --> 08:48.996
We see your point,

08:48.996 --> 08:50.326
Mr. Campbell.

08:50.326 --> 08:51.496
And this message...

08:51.496 --> 08:53.478
you're taking it to people in your community?

08:53.478 --> 08:56.293
Yes. To my students and local business groups.

08:56.293 --> 08:58.457
Right here is the battleground.

08:58.457 --> 09:01.149
Right, not the Upper East Side or Sunset Park.

09:01.149 --> 09:03.232
Excuse me.

09:03.232 --> 09:05.965
You know, I find animal behavior...

09:05.965 --> 09:07.039
it's fascinating.

09:07.039 --> 09:09.701
I was reading about these bees who

09:09.701 --> 09:11.920
disguise themselves as other bees.

09:11.920 --> 09:14.695
Like the Cape honeybee...

09:14.695 --> 09:17.695
takes on the physical characteristics
of the African bee...

09:18.182 --> 09:19.857
and sneaks into the African hive,

09:19.857 --> 09:22.857
lays eggs, and then eventually destroys that hive.

09:23.019 --> 09:26.017
It's called aggressive mimicry.

09:26.017 --> 09:29.017
It's enough to make a bee paranoid.

09:29.058 --> 09:31.933
We've got another one.

09:31.933 --> 09:33.552
The cleaning staff found him this morning.

09:33.552 --> 09:34.890
The M.O.'s the same as your other two,

09:34.890 --> 09:37.484
so we thought you'd wanna pile on.

09:37.484 --> 09:40.156
One shot to the face with a nine-mil.

09:40.156 --> 09:41.470
Dr. Frederick Mishra,

09:41.470 --> 09:42.198
plastic surgeon.

09:42.198 --> 09:45.198
Looks like he's gonna need a little reconstructive surgery himself.

09:49.163 --> 09:51.205
Facial reconstruction.

09:51.205 --> 09:54.205
Chin tucks.

09:54.507 --> 09:57.507
Face lifts.

09:59.867 --> 10:02.867
The killer pulled all these down,

10:04.391 --> 10:07.391
but only left the rhinoplasties.

10:08.182 --> 10:09.677
Nose jobs.

10:09.677 --> 10:12.677
I'm seeing a theme.

10:16.132 --> 10:17.956
Dr. Mishra always stayed late,

10:17.956 --> 10:20.956
but I always lock the doors to the waiting room when I leave.

10:22.030 --> 10:24.376
Oh, it's this way.

10:24.376 --> 10:26.459
Patients are always getting lost.

10:26.459 --> 10:27.805
What's that door for?

10:27.805 --> 10:29.873
The outside hallway and the elevators.

10:29.873 --> 10:30.959
It's the staff exit.

10:30.959 --> 10:32.754
It's always locked from the outside.

10:32.754 --> 10:34.371
The doctor advertises a lot.

10:34.371 --> 10:37.348
He ever get any unusual calls or threats?

10:37.348 --> 10:40.002
No. Nothing I ever heard of.

10:40.002 --> 10:43.002
That's a slow-closing door.

10:46.334 --> 10:49.334
So this is the stairwell.

10:54.541 --> 10:57.541
He was in here.

10:58.782 --> 11:01.782
He waited and he watched...

11:02.105 --> 11:05.105
until the last person, uh, left...

11:06.565 --> 11:09.565
to catch the elevator.

11:09.648 --> 11:12.648
He got here before the door closed.

11:12.668 --> 11:15.276
Went in, found the doctor...

11:15.276 --> 11:16.446
didn't get lost.

11:16.446 --> 11:17.978
He knew his way around.

11:17.978 --> 11:19.369
Excuse me.

11:19.369 --> 11:22.369
We need a list of your patients for the last two months.

11:24.138 --> 11:27.138
The first eyewear store was in a predominately Hispanic neighborhood.

11:28.005 --> 11:30.332
The second one was two blocks from the synagogue.

11:30.332 --> 11:33.332
And many of Dr. Mishra's patients are Jewish teenage girls.

11:34.760 --> 11:37.536
So our shooter's a racist who's
worried people are changing their looks.

11:37.536 --> 11:39.276
Why? So they can infiltrate the Klan?

11:39.276 --> 11:42.276
Or he might feel threatened by people
he thinks are masking their true identity.

11:43.187 --> 11:44.075
Besides women and young girls,

11:44.075 --> 11:45.263
what are our pickings?

11:45.263 --> 11:48.263
Uh, mostly middle-aged guys getting chin tucks and eye lifts.

11:49.970 --> 11:52.440
This one here had his credit card declined.

11:52.440 --> 11:53.993
John Webb.

11:53.993 --> 11:56.749
Broke his nose in a bar fight 20 years ago.

11:56.749 --> 11:59.440
Twenty years is a long time to wait to fix a broken nose.

11:59.440 --> 12:02.194
Unless he developed breathing problems.

12:02.194 --> 12:04.196
Then he would have seen an E.N.T. First.

12:04.196 --> 12:06.077
Which he didn't. There's no referral.

12:06.077 --> 12:09.077
He just walked in off the street.

12:10.660 --> 12:12.727
He used a bum credit card.

12:12.727 --> 12:14.564
Check with the card company.

12:14.564 --> 12:17.564
Maybe somebody at the doctor's office
can help you with a sketch.

12:19.852 --> 12:21.638
New York Public Library
360 5th Avenue
Friday, April 11

12:21.638 --> 12:23.964
I've had five men in here yesterday who looked like him.

12:23.964 --> 12:25.459
Is this the only sketch you have?

12:25.459 --> 12:26.666
Sorry.

12:26.666 --> 12:29.666
He used a credit card that was reported
stolen from a knapsack here two weeks ago.

12:31.876 --> 12:34.876
Uh, he would've been reading about racial theories,

12:36.502 --> 12:37.835
animal behavior.

12:37.835 --> 12:38.695
Oh, yes.

12:38.695 --> 12:39.782
The ring man.

12:39.782 --> 12:41.905
I caught him marking up a book last week.

12:41.905 --> 12:44.661
Can you show us the book?

12:44.661 --> 12:46.496
Yeah.

12:46.496 --> 12:48.562
You called him the "ring man."

12:48.562 --> 12:51.499
He said because I'm black
I'm from the other side of the ring.

12:51.499 --> 12:54.499
I thought I was being insulted
until I looked at the book he was reading.

12:54.598 --> 12:56.926
It was a biology text.

12:56.926 --> 12:59.926
It mentioned ring species?

12:59.942 --> 13:02.942
It's like birds of the same species
who evolve differently...

13:03.316 --> 13:05.704
because they migrate in opposite
directions around the world.

13:05.704 --> 13:06.738
Yes.

13:06.738 --> 13:09.738
What he's saying is that racial differences are,

13:10.123 --> 13:13.123
uh, evolutionary adaptations
for different environments.

13:13.729 --> 13:14.652
What else did he tell you?

13:14.652 --> 13:17.266
He said at least with me people knew where they stood.

13:17.266 --> 13:19.086
Just point to them, please.

13:19.086 --> 13:22.086
Survival Strategies and Endless Struggle.

13:23.854 --> 13:24.981
Mm, this is nice.

13:24.981 --> 13:27.392
Charles Darwin as a serial killer.

13:27.392 --> 13:30.392
Yeah, his comment about knowing where he stood...

13:32.080 --> 13:35.080
He feels like he's surrounded by...

13:36.373 --> 13:37.639
surrounded by fakes.

13:37.639 --> 13:40.639
That the world is out of order.

13:42.958 --> 13:45.958
That's paranoid delusion.

13:49.294 --> 13:52.294
Here, near the paragraph on aggressive mimicry.

13:53.574 --> 13:56.574
"N.J.B. Is first."

13:56.916 --> 13:59.164
N.J.B.

13:59.164 --> 14:02.164
There was a letter to VisionStyle about her.

14:03.870 --> 14:06.870
"Please confirm that your company supplied
blue contact lenses to Norma Jean Baker.

14:09.939 --> 14:11.923
"You should take credit for helping turn her

14:11.923 --> 14:14.923
into the icon of female beauty named Marilyn Monroe...

14:15.818 --> 14:17.996
"and inspiring millions of women the world

14:17.996 --> 14:20.529
over to alter their appearance.

14:20.529 --> 14:22.815
Please post your reply on your Web site."

14:22.815 --> 14:25.815
He considers Marilyn Monroe a prototype.

14:26.177 --> 14:29.177
An average brunette turned by cosmeticians and plastic surgeons...

14:30.947 --> 14:32.714
into the first fake,

14:32.714 --> 14:34.207
blue-eyed blonde.

14:34.207 --> 14:35.924
She's the vanguard of the master plan

14:35.924 --> 14:38.475
to pollute the gene pool of the pure white race.

14:38.475 --> 14:40.200
Well, that's the thing.
There's nothing overtly

14:40.200 --> 14:42.733
racist in the notes he made in the books.

14:42.733 --> 14:44.851
No return address.

14:44.851 --> 14:45.771
No fingerprints.

14:45.771 --> 14:47.104
How about the books?

14:47.104 --> 14:48.230
No usable prints,

14:48.230 --> 14:51.230
but the librarian improved our sketch.

14:54.658 --> 14:57.658
If this guy's just getting warmed up, we need to go public.

14:59.559 --> 15:02.538
I'll need a check for Natalia's karate lesson.

15:02.538 --> 15:05.103
I already wrote it out. It's on the counter.

15:05.103 --> 15:07.550
Oh. You're always one step ahead of me, sweetie.

15:07.550 --> 15:10.079
Did Charlie talk to you about Mom?

15:10.079 --> 15:13.079
It's all taken care of.

15:25.529 --> 15:27.251
Police now have new information about

15:27.251 --> 15:29.411
the possible suspect in recent killings...

15:29.411 --> 15:32.002
which they've described as a "mini spree."

15:32.002 --> 15:34.897
The murders include the shooting deaths of a plastic surgeon

15:34.897 --> 15:37.023
and two eyeglass store clerks.

15:37.023 --> 15:38.860
He is described as in his '30s,

15:38.860 --> 15:41.166
medium height, with graying hair.

15:41.166 --> 15:44.083
Police say he may have a history of psychiatric problems...

15:44.083 --> 15:46.632
and an obsession with actress Marilyn Monroe.

15:46.632 --> 15:49.108
Anyone with information is asked to contact police

15:49.108 --> 15:51.275
at the number on your screen.

15:51.275 --> 15:54.275
In international news, Israeli...

16:52.231 --> 16:53.092
Is that it?

16:53.092 --> 16:54.301
It came in this morning.

16:54.301 --> 16:56.525
U.S. Mail overnight, from uptown.

16:56.525 --> 16:59.096
No prints.

16:59.096 --> 17:01.768
"Marilyn Monroe:

17:01.768 --> 17:04.226
Fake Aryan Cosmetics Conspiracy."

17:04.226 --> 17:05.881
Yeah, he's establishing his bona fides,

17:05.881 --> 17:07.557
so we know that it's him.

17:07.557 --> 17:08.846
Oh, terrific.

17:08.846 --> 17:11.846
"It will soon be time to take my campaign
to the heart of the dirtyJew conspiracy.

17:12.335 --> 17:14.810
To the home of fake Aryans, to Hollywood."

17:14.810 --> 17:16.527
There's your overtly racist rhetoric.

17:16.527 --> 17:19.280
The important part is the last paragraph.

17:19.280 --> 17:22.280
"Before I leave, I will make one more strike against the conspiracy.

17:23.520 --> 17:26.520
I will kill the bitch who Aryanized the mayor's girlfriend."

17:27.169 --> 17:29.515
So he's done the blue eyes.

17:29.515 --> 17:31.720
He's got the surgical enhancement.

17:31.720 --> 17:34.051
There's only one thing left.

17:34.051 --> 17:34.894
Blonde hair.

17:34.894 --> 17:36.874
The mayor's girlfriend wasn't born a blonde.

17:36.874 --> 17:39.874
He's going after her hair colorist.

17:41.965 --> 17:43.379
When the staff came in this morning,

17:43.379 --> 17:46.379
this is what they found.

17:47.067 --> 17:48.925
I would've been here last night working,

17:48.925 --> 17:51.925
but I had to stay in Washington an extra day.

17:51.946 --> 17:54.066
It might've been the man we told you about on the phone.

17:54.066 --> 17:56.373
Do you recognize him?

17:56.373 --> 17:57.701
Yes.

17:57.701 --> 18:00.044
He was here last Tuesday.

18:00.044 --> 18:03.044
He had me dye his hair blond.

18:03.529 --> 18:05.209
He knew you worked late?

18:05.209 --> 18:07.879
Yes. We talked about my schedule.

18:07.879 --> 18:09.293
What else did you talk about?

18:09.293 --> 18:11.558
The coloring process.

18:11.558 --> 18:14.558
He was worried for me because of the chemicals.

18:16.244 --> 18:19.244
He was very nice.

18:19.608 --> 18:21.649
There was something sweet about him,

18:21.649 --> 18:23.801
like a child.

18:23.801 --> 18:26.757
How did he get the appointment with you?

18:26.757 --> 18:29.022
I only take new clients on referral.

18:29.022 --> 18:32.022
We'll need the name of the person who referred him.

18:33.345 --> 18:35.062
So he mailed the letter yesterday,

18:35.062 --> 18:36.879
warning us about his next move.

18:36.879 --> 18:39.879
Makes his move last night
before we even got the letter.

18:40.082 --> 18:42.203
Why bother warning us?

18:42.203 --> 18:45.203
The letter was angry and hateful, racist.

18:46.239 --> 18:49.239
She describes him as being considerate, pleasant...

18:49.663 --> 18:50.467
Sweet.

18:50.467 --> 18:53.280
Sweet.

18:53.280 --> 18:54.878
Our shooter didn't write that letter.

18:54.878 --> 18:57.878
Great, another nut in the mix.

19:01.130 --> 19:04.130
Miss, if you could just look at our little drawing here.?

19:04.264 --> 19:07.264
Do-Do you know him?

19:10.292 --> 19:12.210
One of my male friends needed a hair colorist,

19:12.210 --> 19:14.089
and I referred him to Parveen.

19:14.089 --> 19:15.480
So what'd this guy do?

19:15.480 --> 19:17.837
He shot three people...point-blank in the face,

19:17.837 --> 19:20.837
and then he broke into a hair salon to shoot Parveen.

19:21.198 --> 19:24.198
No. This isn't the guy.

19:25.805 --> 19:26.666
Well, this guy,

19:26.666 --> 19:29.666
did he ever talk about people changing their appearance?

19:30.174 --> 19:32.073
Changing their hair, their eyes.

19:32.073 --> 19:34.480
Trying to look like Marilyn Monroe.

19:34.480 --> 19:36.724
Yeah, he said everybody was starting to look alike.

19:36.724 --> 19:39.724
He said people were starting to lose the beauty God gave 'em.

19:41.710 --> 19:42.838
That's why he likes you.

19:42.838 --> 19:45.143
You're natural.

19:45.143 --> 19:47.755
I guess. Yeah.

19:47.755 --> 19:50.755
All we ever did was talk and hold hands.

19:50.933 --> 19:53.933
That's what he paid for.

19:54.197 --> 19:56.771
These killings, they don't sound like him.

19:56.771 --> 19:59.666
He wrote us a letter.

19:59.666 --> 20:02.666
"It will soon be time to make my campaign to the heart of the dirtyJew conspiracy.

20:05.062 --> 20:07.308
To the home of the fake Aryans,

20:07.308 --> 20:10.308
to Hollywood."

20:13.213 --> 20:16.213
Uh, I didn't know that he thought things like this.

20:17.818 --> 20:20.818
He was always so decent with me.

20:20.978 --> 20:22.207
We need to find him.

20:22.207 --> 20:24.309
What's his name?

20:24.309 --> 20:27.042
Brent. I don't know the rest.

20:27.042 --> 20:29.979
The last time I saw him was a couple of weeks ago.

20:29.979 --> 20:31.350
And when he gave you the money,

20:31.350 --> 20:32.946
where did he get it?

20:32.946 --> 20:35.148
From a Bankers Trust building.

20:35.148 --> 20:38.148
We went up to an accounting office.

20:39.550 --> 20:41.287
I'm really terrible with faces.

20:41.287 --> 20:42.231
Hmm.

20:42.231 --> 20:43.437
Well, your receptionist,

20:43.437 --> 20:45.298
on the other hand, is terrific.

20:45.298 --> 20:47.261
She remembers him. She remembers the young lady

20:47.261 --> 20:50.261
he came in with and that he asked for you by name.

20:50.544 --> 20:53.544
Think hard, Mr. Anderson.

20:54.922 --> 20:57.922
Okay. Now I remember.

20:58.593 --> 21:00.330
It was an I.R.S. Matter. He was a messenger.

21:00.330 --> 21:01.780
He came for some documents.

21:01.780 --> 21:03.619
What kind of I.R.S. Matter?

21:03.619 --> 21:06.619
Our firm's been contracted by the I.R.S. To, uh,

21:06.691 --> 21:09.222
investigate individuals hiding foreign income.

21:09.222 --> 21:11.547
Is that why you have these books here?

21:11.547 --> 21:14.547
Tax codes for Belize, the Caymans?

21:15.911 --> 21:18.911
Anyway, I don't know what messenger service the I.R.S. Uses.

21:19.518 --> 21:21.476
I'll have someone call you.

21:21.476 --> 21:24.476
You don't have an extra manilla folder, do you?

21:25.836 --> 21:28.550
We got a letter from the man in that sketch, from Brent.

21:28.550 --> 21:29.923
It was filled with sick,

21:29.923 --> 21:32.613
anti-Semitic stuff.

21:32.613 --> 21:34.622
The world's filled with bad people.

21:34.622 --> 21:36.779
If you could just put the sketch in the folder for me,

21:36.779 --> 21:39.779
it'd be great.

21:44.800 --> 21:46.638
Do you mind my asking?

21:46.638 --> 21:49.377
Why do you need a manilla folder?

21:49.377 --> 21:51.884
To preserve your fingerprints.

21:51.884 --> 21:54.204
You see, we don't think Brent wrote that letter,

21:54.204 --> 21:55.879
so we're looking to match a fingerprint

21:55.879 --> 21:58.590
we found on the envelope the letter came in.

21:58.590 --> 22:00.844
We think the person that wrote the letter

22:00.844 --> 22:03.844
was trying to throw us off the killer's trail.

22:05.309 --> 22:07.775
Didn't wanna hurt him.
Didn't want anybody else to get hurt.

22:07.775 --> 22:10.118
So he sent us a hint about the next victim.

22:10.118 --> 22:11.711
Saved a life.

22:11.711 --> 22:14.533
You know, people who write letters like that are

22:14.533 --> 22:17.533
usually family members...

22:18.323 --> 22:21.323
fathers, brothers.

22:27.056 --> 22:30.056
Brent has problems.

22:30.523 --> 22:33.523
He, uh, took a lot of drugs when he was young.

22:33.908 --> 22:35.775
I, uh, I try...

22:35.775 --> 22:38.775
We know how it is with brothers, Mr. Anderson.

22:40.851 --> 22:43.851
You wanna tell us about the money you give him?

22:44.889 --> 22:45.686
Uh,

22:45.686 --> 22:48.254
it's a trust set up by our parents.

22:48.254 --> 22:50.071
I give him a check every month to deposit.

22:50.071 --> 22:52.382
He can only withdraw $200 a day.

22:52.382 --> 22:54.168
How can we find him?

22:54.168 --> 22:55.170
I don't know. He, uh,

22:55.170 --> 22:57.175
calls me when he needs something.

22:57.175 --> 23:00.175
So do you have his last bank statement?

23:03.394 --> 23:06.394
It's gonna be bad when you catch him.

23:07.656 --> 23:09.620
It's gonna be a lot of publicity.

23:09.620 --> 23:12.009
Reporters crawling all over me.

23:12.009 --> 23:14.606
I'd count on it.

23:14.606 --> 23:16.975
He uses A.T.M. S all over the city.

23:16.975 --> 23:18.738
We can't cover every base.

23:18.738 --> 23:21.738
And if we turn off the tap, he'll run.

23:22.557 --> 23:25.557
Well, maybe we only need to turn it halfway.

23:26.557 --> 23:29.557
How do you think your brother
would react to being shortchanged?

23:31.034 --> 23:32.630
He'd make a stink.

23:32.630 --> 23:35.448
He's a screwup.

23:35.448 --> 23:38.448
He's always been a screwup.

23:40.402 --> 23:43.337
Bank Of New York
126 West 18th Street
Tuesday, April 15

23:43.337 --> 23:44.260
I have an account here,

23:44.260 --> 23:47.260
but I tried to get $200 from an A. T.M. In Brooklyn,

23:47.558 --> 23:50.539
but it-it only gave me a hundred dollars.

23:50.539 --> 23:53.539
And when I called, they said I had to come in and talk to you...

23:53.676 --> 23:55.272
Oh, I know all about the problem.

23:55.272 --> 23:57.987
Have a seat.

23:57.987 --> 24:00.987
I'll need your card and some I.D.

24:03.371 --> 24:06.371
Could you take off your sunglasses?

24:10.602 --> 24:13.199
This says you have brown eyes.

24:13.199 --> 24:15.128
I'm wearing contacts,

24:15.128 --> 24:17.449
and this isn't my hair.

24:17.449 --> 24:19.613
I'm conducting an experiment.

24:19.613 --> 24:22.412
Oh, you're a scientist.

24:22.412 --> 24:25.412
Well, I'll need you to fill out this form.

24:29.147 --> 24:32.147
You're under arrest, Brent.

24:32.595 --> 24:35.595
Your nurse and your librarian
pooched the lineup.

24:36.635 --> 24:38.230
You have no murder weapon.

24:38.230 --> 24:41.094
Not one crumb of physical evidence
tying him to the crime scene.

24:41.094 --> 24:43.119
Even his brother thinks he's good for it.

24:43.119 --> 24:45.216
No. Spencer loves me.

24:45.216 --> 24:46.265
He wouldn't say that.

24:46.265 --> 24:49.265
- Brent, let me do the talking.
- Right, right.

24:49.703 --> 24:52.703
Let's talk about this letter
to VisionStyle about Marilyn Monroe.

24:52.897 --> 24:54.091
You did write this, right?

24:54.091 --> 24:56.085
He's not answering that.

24:56.085 --> 24:57.062
Come on. You're no fun.

24:57.062 --> 24:58.882
Look at him. He's peeing himself...

24:58.882 --> 25:01.844
to tell us about this fake Aryan cosmetic conspiracy.

25:01.844 --> 25:02.594
I mean, aren't you, Brent?

25:02.594 --> 25:03.742
Don't answer him.

25:03.742 --> 25:06.133
Soon they're gonna be able to transplant faces.

25:06.133 --> 25:09.133
They'll be able to do plastic surgery
to babies that are still in the womb.

25:09.776 --> 25:10.922
Wh-What do you think about that?

25:10.922 --> 25:12.680
Don't answer.

25:12.680 --> 25:14.339
The interview's over.

25:14.339 --> 25:17.339
He's right. Don't answer.

25:20.272 --> 25:23.272
You talk about this fake Aryan conspiracy,

25:24.001 --> 25:27.001
but you're the only one that's hair's dyed...

25:27.207 --> 25:30.207
and you're wearing tinted lenses.

25:30.474 --> 25:32.452
You've become what you dread.

25:32.452 --> 25:33.969
Maybe you're being used?

25:33.969 --> 25:36.969
Maybe your murders are servicing the conspiracy,

25:37.562 --> 25:40.562
and you don't even know it.

25:42.842 --> 25:45.842
You-You should think about that.

25:54.028 --> 25:56.786
The lawyer said they have
no evidence against you,

25:56.786 --> 25:59.702
and you don't have to worry about that notebook.

25:59.702 --> 26:02.702
Spence, I can't stop thinking about what that cop said.

26:03.090 --> 26:04.645
I think I need to tell the truth.

26:04.645 --> 26:07.645
You're not doing anything
except for what your lawyer tells you.

26:09.521 --> 26:11.380
Betty is beside herself.

26:11.380 --> 26:13.282
We got reporters camping outside.

26:13.282 --> 26:15.061
You have no idea what this has done to me.

26:15.061 --> 26:18.061
- After all the years I've been there for you.
- I know. I know.

26:18.335 --> 26:20.300
You always had my back.

26:20.300 --> 26:23.200
Your lawyer thinks we can get you out of this.

26:23.200 --> 26:24.793
But I need your help.

26:24.793 --> 26:26.634
How?

26:26.634 --> 26:28.965
There's something you left out there.

26:28.965 --> 26:31.640
Hidden.

26:31.640 --> 26:34.640
You know what I mean.

26:36.595 --> 26:39.595
I'm gonna take care of everything, Brent.

26:40.086 --> 26:43.086
Just like always.

26:47.402 --> 26:48.509
You said so yourself.

26:48.509 --> 26:51.042
You have no physical evidence
this person is the shooter.

26:51.042 --> 26:52.372
We have his statements

26:52.372 --> 26:54.580
and the Marilyn Monroe letter you received.

26:54.580 --> 26:57.398
That supports our theory
he was targeting your product.

26:57.398 --> 26:59.569
We're not going to let you parade

26:59.569 --> 27:02.328
your cockamamy theory before the public.

27:02.328 --> 27:04.856
Look, if you're worried that your retailers...

27:04.856 --> 27:07.856
are going to be afraid to carry your contact lenses,

27:08.162 --> 27:09.860
we have your shooter in custody.

27:09.860 --> 27:11.132
According to you.

27:11.132 --> 27:12.647
We need someone to testify...

27:12.647 --> 27:14.391
they actually opened this letter,

27:14.391 --> 27:16.023
or we can't use it as evidence.

27:16.023 --> 27:19.023
And you can't connect
VisionStyle to the shootings.

27:20.832 --> 27:23.832
We'll make a good faith
effort to find the person.

27:26.703 --> 27:28.505
Carver here.

27:28.505 --> 27:30.792
Yes, hold on.

27:30.792 --> 27:33.164
Your partner.

27:33.164 --> 27:36.164
Eyeporium
276 Greenwich Street
Friday, April 18

27:36.271 --> 27:37.501
The owner was closing up.

27:37.501 --> 27:39.689
Two shots to the head from behind.

27:39.689 --> 27:42.425
We have two shell casings, nine-millimeter.

27:42.425 --> 27:44.796
And there's that.

27:44.796 --> 27:46.759
The M.O.'s not quite right,

27:46.759 --> 27:49.759
but it's in the ballpark.

27:51.429 --> 27:54.429
The twisted tango of brotherly love.

27:57.913 --> 27:59.737
How can you think he's hiding evidence

27:59.737 --> 28:02.130
when he's the one who helped
you catch Brent?

28:02.130 --> 28:03.442
Well, maybe it was that phony letter

28:03.442 --> 28:05.382
he wrote to put us off Brent's trail.

28:05.382 --> 28:08.106
The last time Brent was here was six years ago.

28:08.106 --> 28:10.174
You're not gonna find anything of his here.

28:10.174 --> 28:11.790
Six years is a long time

28:11.790 --> 28:14.366
not to have Uncle Brent over for dinner.

28:14.366 --> 28:16.592
Spencer doesn't want him around the kids.

28:16.592 --> 28:19.592
Spencer still takes care of his brother though, doesn't he?

28:19.624 --> 28:21.968
He made a promise to his parents.

28:21.968 --> 28:24.968
Spencer's very conscientious about his obligations.

28:25.069 --> 28:27.311
Sounds like there's more obligation than

28:27.311 --> 28:29.338
love between those two.

28:29.338 --> 28:32.338
Brent's caused Spencer a lot of grief over the years.

28:33.601 --> 28:36.601
He spends a lot of time in here, huh?

28:37.141 --> 28:38.809
He's got all this reading material,

28:38.809 --> 28:41.809
tax and accounting related.

28:42.965 --> 28:45.174
So what's this problem that Brent caused?

28:45.174 --> 28:48.174
Spencer's had to bail him out of jail at all hours.

28:48.339 --> 28:50.587
Brent's even kept him from getting promoted.

28:50.587 --> 28:52.389
How'd he managed that?

28:52.389 --> 28:53.556
I don't know.

28:53.556 --> 28:54.969
But for the longest time,

28:54.969 --> 28:57.969
Spencer blamed him.

28:59.600 --> 29:01.755
You have any idea what this stuff is for?

29:01.755 --> 29:03.780
Cotton,

29:03.780 --> 29:05.502
chamomile tea,

29:05.502 --> 29:07.509
food coloring,

29:07.509 --> 29:09.288
earplugs.

29:09.288 --> 29:10.888
I don't know who put that there.

29:10.888 --> 29:13.888
Maybe one of the kids for a science project.

29:14.280 --> 29:17.280
We're done.

29:17.812 --> 29:20.812
I'd sure like to see that science project.

29:21.207 --> 29:24.207
Thank you.

29:26.529 --> 29:27.818
You're talking about an accountant.

29:27.818 --> 29:30.007
Who had a sealed juvie record in Jersey.

29:30.007 --> 29:31.693
He got it expunged a few years ago,

29:31.693 --> 29:33.613
but it gave him problems at work.

29:33.613 --> 29:34.801
He couldn't get bonded.

29:34.801 --> 29:37.160
We're working on getting the details.

29:37.160 --> 29:40.160
Okay. So he finds out from Brent
where he hid the gun.

29:40.803 --> 29:43.670
Then he commits a copycat murder to clear him?

29:43.670 --> 29:44.924
This is some brother.

29:44.924 --> 29:47.924
We're not so sure Spencer
loves Brent all that much.

29:48.381 --> 29:51.381
We might not be the ones
he's trying to fool.

29:51.638 --> 29:52.606
He used the same gun,

29:52.606 --> 29:55.606
but he botched the M.O.

29:55.974 --> 29:58.684
The other victims were shot point-blank in the face

29:58.684 --> 30:00.605
inside their place of business.

30:00.605 --> 30:03.605
This one, was shot twice

30:04.343 --> 30:06.693
from the back outside.

30:06.693 --> 30:09.632
So if he's not trying to clear his brother,

30:09.632 --> 30:12.632
what's his point?

30:28.838 --> 30:30.862
It's a travel kit.

30:30.862 --> 30:32.927
Um,

30:32.927 --> 30:34.360
money.

30:34.360 --> 30:37.360
His point is money.

30:37.569 --> 30:40.184
Office of A.D.A.Ron Carver
One Hogan Place
Wednesday, April 23

30:40.184 --> 30:41.375
My colleagues at the S.E.C.

30:41.375 --> 30:44.174
Tell me you just refiled your quarterly earnings...

30:44.174 --> 30:47.174
to show an additional loss of $5 million?

30:47.826 --> 30:48.707
Where'd that money go?

30:48.707 --> 30:50.862
You're chasing moonbeams, Mr. Carver.

30:50.862 --> 30:53.862
You doubted that Brent Anderson
was the killer

30:54.140 --> 30:57.140
even before the last victim was shot.

30:58.321 --> 31:00.011
What are we supposed to think?

31:00.011 --> 31:01.942
I'm ordering an examination of your books.

31:01.942 --> 31:03.578
I'll find the $5 million.

31:03.578 --> 31:06.578
Then I'm charging you with criminally negligent homicide.

31:15.068 --> 31:17.521
We did receive an extortion demand...

31:17.521 --> 31:20.521
after the sketch of the suspect was released to the press.

31:22.026 --> 31:23.868
They asked for $5 million

31:23.868 --> 31:26.320
or they'd send a manifesto to the media...

31:26.320 --> 31:29.100
saying they were targeting
retailers of our products.

31:29.100 --> 31:31.876
The effect on the company would have been devastating.

31:31.876 --> 31:33.431
We had to think of our employees.

31:33.431 --> 31:36.331
Yes, I'm sure they were foremost in your thoughts.

31:36.331 --> 31:37.640
What happened then?

31:37.640 --> 31:39.075
When you arrested Brent Anderson,

31:39.075 --> 31:40.754
we received another communication,

31:40.754 --> 31:42.856
saying the police had the wrong man.

31:42.856 --> 31:43.781
We weren't sure what to do,

31:43.781 --> 31:46.274
and then another retailer was killed.

31:46.274 --> 31:47.971
Then you paid.

31:47.971 --> 31:49.487
Yes.

31:49.487 --> 31:52.487
We had a security firm track the money to the Caribbean.

31:52.812 --> 31:54.929
It was dispersed among several accounts

31:54.929 --> 31:57.929
in the Caymans and Belize, and...

31:58.072 --> 32:01.072
then we ran into a brick wall.

32:05.332 --> 32:07.546
The brick wall was probably

32:07.546 --> 32:10.448
the I.R.S. Investigation that
Spencer was working on.

32:10.448 --> 32:12.208
Mm-hmm.

32:12.208 --> 32:14.244
He must've sprinkled the five million...

32:14.244 --> 32:17.013
among the accounts frozen by the I.R.S.

32:17.013 --> 32:18.909
And only he knows which account

32:18.909 --> 32:21.909
the money's in and how to retrieve it.

32:22.683 --> 32:25.683
Can't do it from here, you gotta go there.

32:27.679 --> 32:30.679
Guys, can you get off the walk, please?

32:31.506 --> 32:34.506
Please. We're late.

32:43.084 --> 32:46.084
I thought I told you people to stay off my property.

32:47.530 --> 32:48.818
Didn't you people hear me?

32:48.818 --> 32:50.626
Did you hear us? You're under arrest.

32:50.626 --> 32:52.568
- What are you doing?
- Don't think you're gonna make that flight to Houston.

32:52.568 --> 32:55.568
Or the nice drive across the Mexican border.

32:57.035 --> 32:59.162
Spencer Anderson covered
his tracks like a pro.

32:59.162 --> 33:00.615
We can't connect him to anything.

33:00.615 --> 33:01.948
Brent told him where the gun was.

33:01.948 --> 33:03.295
Brent can put him in jail.

33:03.295 --> 33:05.037
Brent, who's convinced his brother loves him.

33:05.037 --> 33:07.248
I just received his psych evaluation.

33:07.248 --> 33:10.248
Paranoid schizophrenia exacerbated by drug abuse.

33:10.698 --> 33:12.636
The juvenile records came in from New Jersey.

33:12.636 --> 33:14.053
Two of them.

33:14.053 --> 33:16.647
One for Spencer Anderson,

33:16.647 --> 33:19.647
and one for Brent Anderson.

33:27.183 --> 33:29.141
Y-You know I find

33:29.141 --> 33:32.141
paranoid schizophrenics make excellent witnesses.

33:35.831 --> 33:38.831
You're conferring transactional immunity to my client?

33:38.889 --> 33:41.300
For anything he agrees to testify to.

33:41.300 --> 33:43.344
In return, I'd offer him a plea of not guilty

33:43.344 --> 33:46.344
by reason of mental disease.

33:46.527 --> 33:48.749
Whatever happens, he's covered.

33:48.749 --> 33:51.362
Uh, I don't have a disease.

33:51.362 --> 33:53.346
It's all good, Brent.

33:53.346 --> 33:55.065
Don't worry.

33:55.065 --> 33:56.549
But we're still not conceding

33:56.549 --> 33:58.292
he had anything to do with the shootings.

33:58.292 --> 33:59.030
That's fine.

33:59.030 --> 34:01.724
We just want his testimony.

34:01.724 --> 34:03.307
By the way,

34:03.307 --> 34:06.307
his immunity starts now.

34:11.110 --> 34:13.380
Why's my brother here?

34:13.380 --> 34:15.036
What crazy stuff has he been saying to them?

34:15.036 --> 34:16.328
Oh, it's all good, Spence.

34:16.328 --> 34:17.659
I didn't let you down.

34:17.659 --> 34:19.969
Mr. Carver, if this is
one of those dog and pony shows,

34:19.969 --> 34:21.303
we're not interested.

34:21.303 --> 34:23.937
We were about to review our evidence against your client.

34:23.937 --> 34:26.937
See what insights his brother has to offer.

34:27.059 --> 34:28.225
You never know what kind of crazy stuff

34:28.225 --> 34:31.225
might come out of Brent's mouth.

34:31.635 --> 34:32.927
I wanna stay.

34:32.927 --> 34:34.360
I wanna hear this.

34:34.360 --> 34:37.360
All right. Come on.

34:40.376 --> 34:42.053
First thing you should know, Brent,

34:42.053 --> 34:43.322
when we picked up your brother,

34:43.322 --> 34:45.511
he was on his way to the airport...

34:45.511 --> 34:47.431
to catch a plane to Houston.

34:47.431 --> 34:50.016
For business. It was only for the day.

34:50.016 --> 34:53.016
It's true. He was traveling light.

34:54.574 --> 34:56.920
You a big chamomile tea drinker, Spence?

34:56.920 --> 34:59.593
I drink it on the plane. It relaxes me.

34:59.593 --> 35:01.168
The earplugs help me sleep.

35:01.168 --> 35:02.236
And the food coloring,

35:02.236 --> 35:05.155
is that to make the airplane food more appetizing?

35:05.155 --> 35:06.112
What do you think, Brent?

35:06.112 --> 35:09.033
Here, we found this stuff.

35:09.033 --> 35:12.033
Could you guess what he was
really doing with it?

35:13.560 --> 35:16.379
I don't think many people could.

35:16.379 --> 35:19.379
The chamomile tea, I mean,

35:22.313 --> 35:23.954
I hear you can lighten your hair with it,

35:23.954 --> 35:25.130
and the earplugs, well,

35:25.130 --> 35:27.393
you stuff'em in your nose, it would make

35:27.393 --> 35:29.887
your nose wider, same with the cotton.

35:29.887 --> 35:32.542
Or pack your cheeks with it,

35:32.542 --> 35:35.542
change your jawline.

35:35.542 --> 35:38.542
And there's the cold cream

35:39.796 --> 35:41.846
and the food coloring.

35:48.186 --> 35:50.261
Well, look at that.

35:51.769 --> 35:54.681
It did. It made my hands darker.

35:54.681 --> 35:56.468
I know Spence.

35:56.468 --> 35:58.337
My brother's not a fake.

35:58.337 --> 36:00.312
He wouldn't change his looks.

36:00.312 --> 36:01.570
He did it to blend in.

36:01.570 --> 36:03.630
He was running away to the Caribbean.

36:03.630 --> 36:06.630
Do you know why?

36:07.421 --> 36:10.421
To collect the money that VisionStyle was paying him.

36:11.784 --> 36:14.784
Five million dollars, Mr. Anderson.

36:14.942 --> 36:15.989
Here's the bank documents

36:15.989 --> 36:18.989
showing the wire transfers from VisionStyle's accounts.

36:19.703 --> 36:21.480
VisionStyle was trying to

36:21.480 --> 36:24.480
make it look like an extortion attempt.

36:24.660 --> 36:27.660
But we know what was really going on.

36:28.965 --> 36:31.565
He was being paid to betray you.

36:31.565 --> 36:34.565
Brent, they're messing with your head.

36:34.693 --> 36:36.502
See for yourself.

36:36.502 --> 36:37.901
Here's a letter he wrote.

36:37.901 --> 36:40.901
He wanted us to believe you wrote it.

36:45.463 --> 36:48.031
This isn't me.

36:48.031 --> 36:49.411
I like Jewish people.

36:49.411 --> 36:51.753
I like all kinds of people.

36:51.753 --> 36:53.891
He wrote the letter to twist your message.

36:53.891 --> 36:56.150
For God's sake, Brent.

36:56.150 --> 36:57.982
I wrote that to protect you.

36:57.982 --> 36:59.586
To protect him?

36:59.586 --> 37:02.394
How do you think we found outabout your bank and your A.T.M.?

37:02.394 --> 37:04.179
He sold you out.

37:04.179 --> 37:06.449
Everything you ever told him in confidence.

37:06.449 --> 37:09.449
All your secrets, he used against you.

37:09.743 --> 37:11.591
Even the gun.

37:13.239 --> 37:16.239
You told him where the gun was, didn't you?

37:17.402 --> 37:19.863
- Brent.
- You're going to let your client incriminate himself?

37:19.863 --> 37:22.863
His client has immunity.

37:22.875 --> 37:25.136
Oh, geez.

37:25.136 --> 37:27.970
Spencer, we need to talk.

37:27.970 --> 37:28.897
You told him where you hid the gun, right, Brent?

37:28.897 --> 37:30.562
Brent.

37:32.965 --> 37:35.237
You're my brother.

37:35.237 --> 37:38.147
I've never done anything to hurt you.

37:38.147 --> 37:39.445
He's not one of them.

37:39.445 --> 37:40.971
He takes care of me.

37:40.971 --> 37:43.180
Has he?

37:43.180 --> 37:46.156
What about 23 years ago?

37:46.156 --> 37:47.168
What night was that?

37:47.168 --> 37:50.168
Oh, February 17...a convenience store in Trenton?

37:51.507 --> 37:53.991
One of you knocked out the clerk
with a tire iron.

37:53.991 --> 37:56.991
You made off with three cases of beer and a carton of smokes.

37:57.030 --> 37:59.576
How'd you get mixed up in that, Spencer?

37:59.576 --> 38:02.576
I mean, Brent I understand.

38:02.899 --> 38:04.354
He already...

38:04.354 --> 38:06.843
well, had priors for drugs and vandalism.

38:06.843 --> 38:09.843
He was 15. You were 17?

38:10.046 --> 38:11.446
You hadn't been in any trouble.

38:11.446 --> 38:12.907
I don't see what this has to do with anything.

38:12.907 --> 38:15.803
You know, I have a big brother.

38:15.803 --> 38:17.840
My brother was a straight arrow.

38:17.840 --> 38:19.934
I was always trying to get him to

38:19.934 --> 38:22.934
loosen up, always bugging him about it.

38:23.334 --> 38:25.614
Drove him crazy,

38:26.689 --> 38:29.461
because he couldn't loosen up.

38:29.461 --> 38:32.461
Because my father never gave him any slack.

38:32.824 --> 38:34.838
Same situation with you and Spence?

38:34.838 --> 38:36.534
You were always trying to

38:36.534 --> 38:39.138
stop him from being so afraid all the time.

38:39.138 --> 38:42.138
I think he got sick of hearing it.

38:42.159 --> 38:44.572
So that night,

38:44.572 --> 38:47.572
he decided to show you that he wasn't afraid.

38:48.513 --> 38:49.774
Decided to stop for beer

38:49.774 --> 38:51.790
and before you knew what was going on,

38:51.790 --> 38:54.316
he was hitting that clerk with the tire iron.

38:54.316 --> 38:55.822
Isn't that right, Brent?

38:55.822 --> 38:58.185
It's what you told the police.

38:58.185 --> 39:00.443
It's right here in your juvenile record.

39:00.443 --> 39:01.582
Yeah, I had to tell them the truth.

39:01.582 --> 39:03.474
We both told the truth.

39:03.474 --> 39:05.871
Then why did Spencer only get probation,

39:05.871 --> 39:08.817
and you got three years in juvenile detention?

39:08.817 --> 39:10.667
They didn't believe us.

39:10.667 --> 39:13.037
They thought it was all my idea

39:13.037 --> 39:16.037
and that Spencer was protecting me.

39:16.177 --> 39:18.097
Well, I have Spencer's juvenile file right here.

39:18.097 --> 39:19.414
You wanna hear what he told the police?

39:19.414 --> 39:21.017
My file was expunged.

39:21.017 --> 39:23.991
Expunged doesn't mean vaporized.

39:23.991 --> 39:26.357
This is how your brother took care of you.

39:26.357 --> 39:28.922
"I was looking at the magazines
when I heard a noise.

39:28.922 --> 39:30.604
"I looked up. I saw Brent standing

39:30.604 --> 39:33.604
over the clerk with the tire iron, hitting him.

39:34.623 --> 39:35.923
"He had that crazy look

39:35.923 --> 39:37.189
he gets when he's stoned,

39:37.189 --> 39:39.590
just like a rabid dog.

39:39.590 --> 39:41.765
Brent's just a bad kid who
just wants to get high

39:41.765 --> 39:44.477
and make trouble for my parents."

39:44.477 --> 39:47.477
You told the truth, he didn't.

39:48.536 --> 39:49.956
He put it all on you.

39:49.956 --> 39:51.768
Brent, now, you remember...

39:51.768 --> 39:53.994
I was going to college;

39:53.994 --> 39:55.005
my life was on track.

39:55.005 --> 39:57.490
And you, you weren't going anywhere.

39:57.490 --> 40:00.230
Oh, Spence. Come on.

40:00.230 --> 40:01.717
Don't say that.

40:01.717 --> 40:04.118
No. He means every word of it.

40:04.118 --> 40:07.118
You... You did the time for a crime that he committed...

40:07.146 --> 40:08.992
three years.

40:11.065 --> 40:14.065
You never recovered.

40:14.248 --> 40:16.424
Did ya?

40:20.873 --> 40:22.584
Just got sicker and sicker.

40:22.584 --> 40:24.187
That's his own fault.

40:24.187 --> 40:25.651
He made himself that way.

40:25.651 --> 40:28.651
Yeah. Yeah, he made himself a paranoid schizophrenic.

40:31.056 --> 40:34.056
He's not.
Would you like to read the doctor's report?

40:34.148 --> 40:35.912
No, he doesn't wanna see that because

40:35.912 --> 40:38.503
he never really cared, did you, Spence?

40:38.503 --> 40:41.255
Because if he was sick, well, then,

40:41.255 --> 40:43.954
you might have actually had to do something about it.

40:43.954 --> 40:45.764
But if it was drugs, well, that was easy.

40:45.764 --> 40:46.629
You wouldn't have to lift a finger.

40:46.629 --> 40:48.808
Not if it was drugs.

40:48.808 --> 40:50.003
Spencer helps me.

40:50.003 --> 40:51.628
He takes care of me.

40:51.628 --> 40:52.700
Yeah, he helps you.

40:52.700 --> 40:55.473
Pays you once a month to stay away from him...

40:55.473 --> 40:57.054
and his family.

40:58.435 --> 41:01.435
Until everything changed
when he saw the sketch on TV.

41:01.975 --> 41:04.975
Because you knew that the press
would be crawling all over you and Brent.

41:06.564 --> 41:09.564
That they would see
what a terrible brother that you'd been.

41:10.543 --> 41:13.543
They would see the blood on your hands,

41:14.277 --> 41:17.277
as much as it is on Brent's.

41:18.132 --> 41:20.638
You saw the weight falling on you,

41:20.638 --> 41:23.638
and you had to run.

41:25.274 --> 41:27.982
That's your brother, man.

41:27.982 --> 41:29.956
He's sick.

41:31.518 --> 41:34.272
You should've helped him,

41:34.272 --> 41:37.272
but you used him.

41:40.585 --> 41:43.585
Used him to get five million bucks to get out of Dodge.

41:43.744 --> 41:46.392
That's why he needed your gun.

41:46.392 --> 41:47.545
After we arrested you,

41:47.545 --> 41:48.980
it was only a matter of time before

41:48.980 --> 41:51.078
we found out about his extortion.

41:51.078 --> 41:54.078
You had to play out your hand, didn't you?

41:55.153 --> 41:58.153
You had to do one more murder.

42:00.175 --> 42:03.071
Do you see where you stand with him now?

42:03.071 --> 42:04.227
He ran out on you.

42:04.227 --> 42:06.382
He left you in your own mess.

42:06.382 --> 42:08.337
Oh, Spence.

42:08.337 --> 42:09.737
That's not what you told me.

42:09.737 --> 42:11.905
Brent.

42:11.905 --> 42:14.905
You do this to me...

42:16.151 --> 42:19.151
He said I had to tell him where I hid the gun.

42:19.514 --> 42:21.813
He'd get rid of it before the police found it.

42:21.813 --> 42:23.552
Shut up.

42:25.446 --> 42:27.339
None of this is true.

42:27.339 --> 42:29.762
You said so yourself, he's crazy.

42:29.762 --> 42:32.144
Yeah, he may be crazy.

42:32.144 --> 42:34.668
But you're evil.

42:37.052 --> 42:38.226
Come on, Spence.

42:38.226 --> 42:41.174
Don't be angry.
Will you just shut up!

42:41.174 --> 42:43.249
Mom and Dad should have left you in Spofford.

42:43.249 --> 42:44.540
And that other place? That rehab?

42:44.540 --> 42:46.230
They should have left you there too.

42:46.230 --> 42:47.933
Why didn't you crawl away and die?

42:47.933 --> 42:49.477
Why did you have to ruin my life?

42:49.477 --> 42:52.477
I never wanted you. I didn't...

43:04.100 --> 43:05.685
It'll be okay, Spence.

43:05.685 --> 43:08.685
I'm still your brother.

43:13.841 --> 43:17.024
The tango just goes on.
