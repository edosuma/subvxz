00:02.809 --> 00:04.148
<i>Previously on "Bel-Air"...</i>

00:04.248 --> 00:05.048
<i>Doc, get your day ones
when you in Virginia</i>

00:05.048 --> 00:06.387
<i>living that D1 college life.</i>

00:06.487 --> 00:07.286
- You little bitch.
- Get off him!

00:11.244 --> 00:13.503
Your flight to LA
leaves in 45 minutes.

00:13.603 --> 00:15.742
<i>Stay in Bel-Air with
your aunt and your uncle.</i>

00:15.842 --> 00:18.181
- What's up, man?
<i>- If you want to do well,</i>

00:18.281 --> 00:19.820
just keep your head down
and follow my lead.

00:19.920 --> 00:21.739
<i>I'm not about to change
who I am to try to fit in.</i>

00:21.839 --> 00:24.617
If you leave, all the content
you've created in this house

00:24.717 --> 00:26.856
belongs to me,
and you owe me a kill fee.

00:26.956 --> 00:30.214
I think you should buy Kylo
out of my influencer house.

00:30.314 --> 00:31.413
I like it.

00:31.513 --> 00:33.252
Start planning to
take over that house.

00:33.352 --> 00:34.931
Tell me this isn't you, Will.

00:35.031 --> 00:36.770
- How did you find that?
- Why would you lie?

00:36.870 --> 00:38.729
Why can't you just accept
the fact that this is over?

00:38.829 --> 00:40.129
Because I love you.

00:40.229 --> 00:42.167
I need you to do me a favour.
Look into my pops.

00:42.267 --> 00:44.366
I need you to see to it that
Lou doesn't come near Will.

00:44.466 --> 00:45.726
Why should you
get to decide that?

00:45.826 --> 00:47.045
Just do what I ask.

00:47.145 --> 00:48.044
Think about my son.

00:48.144 --> 00:49.643
You work for me.

00:49.743 --> 00:51.322
A comprehensive report
on your father.

00:51.422 --> 00:52.962
I don't want to know.

00:53.062 --> 00:54.601
You've been more of a father
to me than any man ever has.

00:54.701 --> 00:55.960
I can't trust you anymore.

00:56.060 --> 00:57.479
You're fired.

00:57.579 --> 00:58.838
<i>My dad is here.</i>

00:58.938 --> 00:59.898
Being with your mama
was the worst mistake

00:59.898 --> 01:01.117
I ever made in my life.

01:01.217 --> 01:02.237
Nigga, you better
chill the fuck out

01:02.337 --> 01:03.596
talking about my mum like that.

01:03.696 --> 01:04.755
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:04.855 --> 01:07.514
Stop, Will.
Please, man, don't go.

01:07.614 --> 01:09.912
You lied, and you let me
think my dad abandoned me.

01:10.012 --> 01:12.011
<i>And now I can't trust
none of y'all.</i>

01:12.491 --> 01:14.590
You told me that this city
would try to make me forget

01:14.690 --> 01:17.169
who I am, and you were right.

He just needs
space to process

02:28.130 --> 02:29.349
Well, it's already
been two weeks.

02:29.449 --> 02:31.028
Baby, if Will says
he needs more time,

02:31.128 --> 02:32.747
that's what we should give him.

02:32.847 --> 02:35.106
Forcing him to move back into
this house before he's ready

02:35.206 --> 02:37.465
won't help any of us move past
the ugliness with Lou.

02:37.565 --> 02:38.824
And we know he's OK.

02:38.924 --> 02:40.103
He's texting and
talking to everybody.

02:40.203 --> 02:42.442
Well, except for Daddy.

02:46.160 --> 02:50.738
Well, I'm glad he's at least
confiding in all of you.

02:50.838 --> 02:53.256
I'm sure he'll realise
that we're his family

02:53.356 --> 02:57.494
and that this is where
he belongs.

02:57.594 --> 02:59.413
- Hey, Will, what's up?
- What up, homie?

02:59.513 --> 03:00.852
What up, D?

03:00.952 --> 03:02.531
Good to see you.
Good to see you.

03:02.631 --> 03:05.330
Let me get the, uh,
catfish and cheese eggs special

03:05.430 --> 03:07.369
with a, uh, veggie omelet.

03:07.469 --> 03:09.527
Just a little something extra.

03:11.466 --> 03:13.045
OK?

03:13.145 --> 03:14.765
And that's on period.

03:16.823 --> 03:18.363
Yo, JB, right on time.

03:18.463 --> 03:19.682
- And you know this.
- What's up?

03:19.782 --> 03:21.781
Time is money, my brother.

03:23.100 --> 03:25.419
All right, appreciate you.

03:28.257 --> 03:29.636
When you going to hook me up
with your guy?

03:29.736 --> 03:31.116
I already told you.

03:31.216 --> 03:32.515
Doc's a busy dude.
He don't just meet with anyone.

03:32.615 --> 03:34.474
All right, good,
'cause I ain't just anyone.

03:34.574 --> 03:36.113
Look, I'm serious
about my future,

03:36.213 --> 03:38.272
and I ain't afraid
to do the work.

03:38.372 --> 03:40.371
Tell him that.

03:41.610 --> 03:43.669
All right,
I'll see what I can do.

03:43.769 --> 03:44.908
All right, that's what
I'm talking about.

03:45.008 --> 03:47.187
Word.

03:47.287 --> 03:49.306
Stay safe out here,
all right?

03:53.204 --> 03:54.743
OK, I'm going to head out.

03:54.843 --> 03:55.942
Got to beat traffic.

03:56.042 --> 03:57.701
Mm, mm.
Well, have a good day, baby.

03:57.801 --> 03:59.140
Drive safely.

03:59.240 --> 04:00.979
- Have a good day, son.
- You know what?

04:01.079 --> 04:02.938
I think I'm going
to head out, too.

04:03.038 --> 04:04.178
Got to celebrate
my first day

04:04.278 --> 04:05.897
as manager
of the influencer house.

04:05.997 --> 04:07.656
I am so impressed
how you and Ivy

04:07.756 --> 04:09.055
just pulled this thing off.

04:09.155 --> 04:11.134
I mean, when we found out
Kylo was in debt

04:11.234 --> 04:12.613
and behind on his mortgage,

04:12.713 --> 04:14.092
we made him an offer
he couldn't refuse.

04:14.192 --> 04:16.491
You mean Ivy made him a offer
he couldn't refuse.

04:16.591 --> 04:18.010
I'ma let that slide 'cause
it's almost your birthday,

04:18.110 --> 04:19.649
but watch it.

04:19.749 --> 04:20.909
'Sides, I'm the one who's
going to be running the house.

04:20.909 --> 04:23.407
- My honeybee is a boss now.
- Period.

04:23.507 --> 04:25.166
And my baby girl
is going to be a teenager.

04:25.266 --> 04:27.085
Ooh, so many RSVPs
have been coming in.

04:27.185 --> 04:29.324
Everyone's so excited
for your birthday tomorrow.

04:29.424 --> 04:32.522
Ugh, Ash, Mum and Dad's
friends give the best gifts.

04:32.622 --> 04:35.001
- Oh.
- When I was 13, I got a horse.

04:35.101 --> 04:37.440
Actually, what happened to him?
- I don't want any gifts.

04:37.540 --> 04:39.479
I mean,
the party's already a lot.

04:39.579 --> 04:41.198
First of all, who are you?

04:41.298 --> 04:43.276
Second of all,
I planned something special.

04:43.376 --> 04:45.075
So can you make an exception
for your big sis?

04:45.175 --> 04:46.874
Fine.

04:46.974 --> 04:48.833
But can we at least tell people

04:48.933 --> 04:50.513
to donate to a cause
I care about,

04:50.613 --> 04:51.912
like Black Girls Rock?

04:52.012 --> 04:53.751
Of course, baby.
It's your party.

04:53.851 --> 04:55.950
Whatever you want, Ash.

04:56.050 --> 04:59.068
Well, then what I really want
is for Will to come home.

05:02.166 --> 05:04.265
I miss him.

05:17.278 --> 05:19.277
Oh, man.

05:23.315 --> 05:25.653
Shit.

05:25.753 --> 05:27.053
My bad, man.
Don't--don't let me interrupt.

05:27.153 --> 05:28.212
No worries, man.

05:28.312 --> 05:29.531
I love loud noises
when I'm praying.

05:29.631 --> 05:30.971
- Sorry, bro.
- You know, I'm just thinking.

05:31.071 --> 05:32.969
Like, after two weeks,
I thought you'd have the timing

05:33.069 --> 05:34.329
a little bit better by now,
you know?

05:34.429 --> 05:36.887
Two weeks?
Damn, it's been that long?

05:36.987 --> 05:40.206
Two weeks, three days,
and six hours.

05:40.306 --> 05:42.324
Look, man, I appreciate you
letting me staying, all right?

05:42.424 --> 05:43.804
You know,
the block feels like home.

05:43.904 --> 05:44.743
Yeah,
you're getting comfortable

05:44.743 --> 05:46.362
in these streets, though.

05:46.462 --> 05:48.001
Coming home real late at night,
2:00, 3:00 in the morning.

05:48.101 --> 05:50.000
What, I got a curfew
or something?

05:51.819 --> 05:53.398
Bro, I'm just making sure
you good, all right?

05:53.498 --> 05:54.997
I'm fine, bro.
Eat your food.

05:55.097 --> 05:56.477
You are not yourself
when you're hungry.

05:56.577 --> 05:58.556
Mm-kay.

05:58.656 --> 06:00.954
This smell good.

06:01.054 --> 06:02.673
Mm.

06:02.773 --> 06:05.272
Yo, this omelet is low key
better than my mama's.

06:05.372 --> 06:06.871
But don't you ever,
ever repeat that.

06:06.971 --> 06:08.250
Shit, they ain't touching
my mum's cheese eggs, though.

06:08.250 --> 06:09.630
That's all I know.
- Oh.

06:10.689 --> 06:12.148
Oh, shit.

06:12.248 --> 06:14.187
Um, bro, put that in
the fridge for me, all right?

06:14.287 --> 06:15.826
I'ma get it when I come back.

OK, look, now I'm worried.

06:51.467 --> 06:53.246
What the hell

06:53.346 --> 06:54.565
Look, not every dollar
in my pocket

06:54.665 --> 06:55.884
has to come from Uncle Phil.

06:55.984 --> 06:57.643
Now, go buy yourself
something nice.

06:57.743 --> 07:00.162
Yeah, but you also can't
live with Jazz forever, either.

07:00.262 --> 07:02.161
Shit, I got more options
than you think.

07:02.261 --> 07:03.560
Why are you being so cryptic?

07:03.660 --> 07:04.999
Look, it just means that

07:05.099 --> 07:06.399
all the shit
that went down with Lou,

07:06.499 --> 07:08.238
I don't need anybody
trying to control my life.

07:28.247 --> 07:30.026

- Don't worry about me.

07:30.126 --> 07:32.025
I'm fine.
- What are you not telling me?

07:32.125 --> 07:35.143
I deserve to know
what's going on, Will.

07:35.243 --> 07:38.621
Where'd that money come from?

07:38.721 --> 07:40.580
Hoopin'.

07:40.680 --> 07:41.939
Just a couple pickup games.
No big deal.

07:42.039 --> 07:43.698
I thought you left that
street shit in Philly.

07:43.798 --> 07:45.417
Look, if you need money,
just ask.

07:45.517 --> 07:47.736
No, man, I'm done
taking handouts, all right?

07:47.836 --> 07:49.095
I need to get back
to who I used to be.

07:49.195 --> 07:50.575
Oh, what, an almost felon
with a gun charge?

07:50.675 --> 07:53.413
Listen, OK?

07:53.513 --> 07:55.052
I was being scouted
to play basketball,

07:55.152 --> 07:57.531
and when I came out here,
all of that went quiet.

07:57.631 --> 07:59.930
But I have a plan.
There's this big-time scout.

08:00.030 --> 08:02.328
His name is Doc, and he helps
a lot of kids get to D1 schools

08:02.428 --> 08:04.007
and even to the pros.

08:04.107 --> 08:06.526
OK, so what, he's like a--
like an agent?

08:06.626 --> 08:08.405
Agent-manager-coach.

08:08.505 --> 08:10.524
Look, I know it sounds sketchy,
but it's legit.

08:10.624 --> 08:12.363
OK, but he's going
to help you?

08:12.463 --> 08:14.002
No, I mean,
I got to meet him first.

08:14.102 --> 08:15.841
But look, I've been balling
with this kid named JB.

08:15.941 --> 08:17.440
He's going to make
the introduction.

08:17.540 --> 08:19.039
OK, why don't you
just let my dad help?

08:19.139 --> 08:20.838
No, bro.

08:20.938 --> 08:23.117
This is my world.
I got to do this without him.

08:23.217 --> 08:24.916
Look,
I know he's not perfect,

08:25.016 --> 08:30.233
but don't forget how
he stuck his neck out for you.

08:30.333 --> 08:33.311
Come on, Will.
We're still your family.

08:40.088 --> 08:42.746
All right, my love, help.

08:42.846 --> 08:44.625
Which one?
- Hmm.

08:44.725 --> 08:47.104
Well, the silver does
bring out your sexiness.

08:47.204 --> 08:48.663
- Mm-hmm.
- But...

08:48.763 --> 08:51.062
since you're going back
into the office,

08:51.162 --> 08:52.061
go with the brown.

08:52.161 --> 08:54.260
Mwah.

08:54.360 --> 08:55.819
Good choice.

08:55.919 --> 08:58.178
I can't believe
you're going back so soon.

08:58.278 --> 09:01.416
Well, you know, I can't
sit still for too long.

09:01.516 --> 09:03.615
Plus, your man is ready
to shake things up a little.

09:03.715 --> 09:04.894
I know you want
to change the world,

09:04.994 --> 09:06.493
but maybe ease into things
before you start

09:06.593 --> 09:08.572
getting all militant.
- I'm just following your lead.

09:08.672 --> 09:10.971
You excited for
this big interview?

09:11.071 --> 09:12.370
I mean, it's not that big.

09:12.470 --> 09:15.968
Uh, a feature article
in "Fine Art Quarterly"

09:16.068 --> 09:21.006
dedicated to the brilliant
Neeman fellow Vivian Banks?

09:21.106 --> 09:23.104
That sounds pretty big to me.

09:24.983 --> 09:26.842
I know that look.

09:26.942 --> 09:29.481
What's wrong?

09:29.581 --> 09:32.839
Well, I mean, it's hard
to celebrate anything when...

09:32.939 --> 09:34.718
Will's not home.

09:34.818 --> 09:36.637
Vy is losing faith in us.

09:36.737 --> 09:38.956
Oh, and Ashley's party.
You heard what she said.

09:39.056 --> 09:39.975
Well, I can't exactly
go grab the boy

09:39.975 --> 09:41.195
by the back of the collar

09:41.295 --> 09:42.674
and drag him through
the front door.

09:42.774 --> 09:44.353
No, but you could apologise.

09:44.453 --> 09:45.432
Apologise for what?

09:45.532 --> 09:48.231
I was right about Lou, huh?

09:48.331 --> 09:50.230
Nothing good came from Will
meeting up with him.

09:50.330 --> 09:53.308
At least he got to see
the kind of man his father is.

09:53.408 --> 09:55.707
We were wrong not to tell him.

09:55.807 --> 09:58.825
Will was doing great
until Lou walked up in here.

09:58.925 --> 10:02.863
This whole mess is his doing,
not ours.

10:20.553 --> 10:22.012
Connor is still pissed
that I broke his arm,

10:22.112 --> 10:23.851
so he's turned
the whole team against me.

10:23.951 --> 10:26.050
Man, forget Connor.
You don't need him.

10:26.150 --> 10:27.689
I know, I'm just--

10:27.789 --> 10:31.487
you know, I work better
in a dynamic duo, you know?

10:31.587 --> 10:33.726
Who, me?

10:33.826 --> 10:35.965
You got jokes.

10:36.065 --> 10:38.004
We could be, like,
the kings of Bel-Air.

10:38.104 --> 10:39.403
Plus, I hate to say it,

10:39.503 --> 10:41.002
but hanging out with you
makes me kind of cool.

10:41.102 --> 10:42.481
Oh, got you.

10:42.581 --> 10:44.000
So you want to be cool
by association?

10:44.100 --> 10:46.759
Like, second-hand cool?
Like, cool once removed?

10:46.859 --> 10:48.438
I'm already regretting it.

10:48.538 --> 10:49.557
No, I just think
it's ironic that

10:49.657 --> 10:50.637
you need me to fit in
at Bel-Air,

10:50.737 --> 10:52.396
but, you know, I got you.

10:52.496 --> 10:53.355
Hey, Carlton.

10:53.455 --> 10:54.795
Hey.

10:58.093 --> 11:01.271
And my first act
as the Batman to your Robin

11:01.371 --> 11:03.310
is to tell you to get on that.
She's feeling you, man.

11:03.410 --> 11:04.909
No.
Yazmin?

11:05.009 --> 11:06.428
Yeah, I mean, I like her.

11:06.528 --> 11:08.387
She's cool,
but, you know,

11:08.487 --> 11:10.706
we just don't have
any classes together.

11:10.806 --> 11:13.984
Our paths don't really
cross naturally.

11:14.084 --> 11:17.422
Well, that sounds like
something I can fix.

11:17.522 --> 11:19.981
What does that even mean?

11:23.479 --> 11:26.697
So I'd like to use my name
and fellowship platform

11:26.797 --> 11:29.736
to give young artists of colour
the access that I never had.

11:29.836 --> 11:31.415
Can you say more about that?

11:31.515 --> 11:34.333
The art world has been
historically known

11:34.433 --> 11:37.811
as an elitist space,
but I want to put Black artists

11:37.911 --> 11:39.690
at the centre
of the conversation,

11:39.790 --> 11:42.009
especially emerging talent.

11:42.109 --> 11:44.448
Interesting, because
according to Reid Broderick,

11:44.548 --> 11:46.726
the focus of your fellowship
will be big events

11:46.826 --> 11:48.885
with more established artists.

11:48.985 --> 11:51.604
I mean,
traditionally, yes,

11:51.704 --> 11:54.282
but Reid knows
I think that focus

11:54.382 --> 11:56.401
is a little bit out of touch.

11:56.501 --> 12:00.519
I want to curate a show
that features all-new artists.

12:00.619 --> 12:02.358
OK, a whole new direction?

12:02.458 --> 12:03.637
Yes, I want to use
this fellowship

12:03.737 --> 12:05.876
as an opportunity
to change the game,

12:05.976 --> 12:08.514
and I intend to do just that.

12:08.614 --> 12:10.114
Love it.

12:23.566 --> 12:24.746
Hey, girl, hey.

12:24.846 --> 12:27.184
Hey.

12:27.284 --> 12:29.583
How's it going?

12:29.683 --> 12:32.342
Good.

12:32.442 --> 12:33.981
Um, you think we could
find a second

12:34.081 --> 12:35.380
to talk about our situation?

12:35.480 --> 12:36.699
I just don't like how
we've been avoiding

12:36.799 --> 12:38.858
the whole issue between us.

12:38.958 --> 12:40.777
Well, I've been trying
to give you your space

12:40.877 --> 12:43.975
since you're going through
a lot.

12:44.075 --> 12:48.133
But, um, yeah, an actual
conversation would be cool.

12:48.233 --> 12:49.692
Cool.

12:49.792 --> 12:52.131
Um, you free tonight?

12:52.231 --> 12:56.169
No, my dad has
a campaign event.

12:56.269 --> 12:58.407
I can't exactly
be your plus one to that.

12:58.507 --> 13:00.246
I'm going
to Ashley's party tomorrow.

13:00.346 --> 13:03.245
We could talk there.
- I'm not going.

13:03.345 --> 13:04.724
Me and Uncle Phil aren't
exactly on the best terms,

13:04.824 --> 13:06.843
and I don't want to bring
that vibe to her party.

13:06.943 --> 13:09.002
You feel me?
- Hey, yo, Will.

13:09.102 --> 13:09.981
Will, Will, Will,
check these out, bro.

13:09.981 --> 13:11.200
OK, I see you.

13:11.300 --> 13:13.359
The Georgetown Sixers.
- What's up, bro?

13:13.459 --> 13:15.278
I guess we'll talk later.

13:15.378 --> 13:16.518

13:30.890 --> 13:33.668

13:33.768 --> 13:35.987

13:37.886 --> 13:40.265
Six more cases just arrived.

13:40.365 --> 13:42.024
Congratulations, y'all.

13:42.124 --> 13:44.862
It'll be the official drink
of our new house.

13:44.962 --> 13:47.461
Oh, I thought we were
doing champagne, but OK.

13:47.561 --> 13:49.779
Grab a bottle.
Let's take a selfie.

13:49.879 --> 13:51.578

13:51.678 --> 13:53.178
Mm-hmm.

13:53.278 --> 13:55.277
All right.

13:58.675 --> 14:03.132
To a fresh start of our
very own content creator house.

14:03.232 --> 14:05.811
Inhale the positive energy.

14:05.911 --> 14:10.728
Exhale the immature,
toxic bullshit.

14:13.866 --> 14:16.325
- Brown boy, fight.
- No!

14:16.425 --> 14:18.424

14:19.663 --> 14:20.963
Oh, yo, this look good, bro.
- Ay, sure, dude.

14:21.063 --> 14:22.642
Thanks!

14:22.742 --> 14:24.481
What are the
Black-ass Brothers doing here?

14:24.581 --> 14:25.800
I'm going to go out
on a limb and say

14:25.900 --> 14:28.518
they don't know
that they've been booted.

14:28.618 --> 14:30.237
Why don't they know?

14:30.337 --> 14:32.676
Uh, I fronted the capital
in my name to buy this house.

14:32.776 --> 14:34.155
Personnel is your department.

14:34.255 --> 14:36.554
So I'm supposed to tell them
they can't live here?

14:36.654 --> 14:38.073
You wanted to manage
the house?

14:38.173 --> 14:40.952
Manage the house, Hil.

14:41.052 --> 14:43.350
- Where are you going?
- I got shit to do,

14:43.450 --> 14:45.549
and I don't want to be here
when you break the news.

14:45.649 --> 14:47.748
Firing people is awkward.

14:47.848 --> 14:49.627

Two Black men doing
the ugly cry at the same time.

15:02.800 --> 15:04.179
I mean, what did you expect
when you decided

15:04.279 --> 15:06.378
to make it the
no-men-allowed kind of house?

15:06.478 --> 15:08.896
I expected Ivy and I
to be a team,

15:08.996 --> 15:10.895
not her farming me out
to do the dirty work.

15:10.995 --> 15:14.134
Sometimes to be the boss,
you got to do the dirty work.

15:14.234 --> 15:16.812
Welcome to my world.

15:16.912 --> 15:18.371
I don't know.
I don't feel like a boss.

15:18.471 --> 15:20.290
I mean, she's making
every decision.

15:20.390 --> 15:22.249
And then on top of that,
the entire house

15:22.349 --> 15:25.088
is an advertisement
for her H2Ivy drink.

15:25.188 --> 15:27.326
Well, look, that's why
you got to set the tone

15:27.426 --> 15:29.165
'cause if you don't,
she's just going to keep on

15:29.265 --> 15:30.365
walking and walking
all over you.

15:30.465 --> 15:33.283
You're right.
We're partners.

15:33.383 --> 15:35.162
I'll talk to her about it
at Ashley's party.

15:35.262 --> 15:37.641
Speaking of, uh,
Ashley's party,

15:37.741 --> 15:41.519
uh, I was kind of thinking
that maybe

15:41.619 --> 15:43.158
we can pull up together?

15:43.258 --> 15:44.237
Ooh, no, no, no.

15:44.337 --> 15:46.156
It would just be
way too obvious.

15:46.256 --> 15:49.754
Well...

15:49.854 --> 15:52.033
maybe it's time to be obvious.

15:52.133 --> 15:53.352
I mean, we both going
to be there.

15:53.452 --> 15:56.391
So let's let the people
know that, you know,

15:56.491 --> 15:58.669
we kickin' it.

15:58.769 --> 16:00.708
Kickin' it?
Is that what we're doing?

16:00.808 --> 16:02.627
I mean, I don't know.

16:02.727 --> 16:05.506
What you want to call it?
- Nothing.

16:05.606 --> 16:08.464
I just feel like I don't want
everyone all in our business,

16:08.564 --> 16:10.503
and I don't want
to ruin a good thing

16:10.603 --> 16:12.902
by trying to label it too soon.

16:13.002 --> 16:15.220
OK.
No, I get it. I get it.

16:15.320 --> 16:17.499
But after the party,

16:17.599 --> 16:20.418
you can come over,
and we can kick it.

16:20.518 --> 16:22.217
Oh, we can kick it?

16:26.714 --> 16:28.693

about your essay,

ask yourselves, what are three
examples of first impressions?

16:35.509 --> 16:37.168

"The Revolution Has Come."

16:51.941 --> 16:53.200
I know how much
you liked reading

16:53.300 --> 16:54.719
about the Black Panther party.

16:54.819 --> 16:56.958
This author, Robyn Spencer,

16:57.058 --> 17:00.396
she talks more about the role
Black women played in it.

17:00.496 --> 17:02.195
Nice.
Can't wait to read it.

17:02.295 --> 17:03.794
And you know
I'll give you extra credit

17:03.894 --> 17:06.473
if you write me a two-page
summary on your thoughts.

17:06.573 --> 17:07.912
Thanks, Ms. Hughes.

17:08.012 --> 17:09.711

my teachers were like you.

17:09.811 --> 17:11.310

of my students

17:11.410 --> 17:13.709
had curious minds like yours.

17:13.809 --> 17:16.427
I'll bring this back
by next week.

17:16.527 --> 17:17.906

17:20.085 --> 17:21.464
my sidekick/henchmen.

17:21.564 --> 17:23.383
Uh, not exactly what I said,
but go on.

17:23.483 --> 17:25.222

to follow my lead, a'ite?

the Black folk meeting?

17:30.520 --> 17:33.298
Yes, this is the
Black Student Union meeting.

17:33.398 --> 17:35.217
- Perfect.
- Hey, what are you doing?

17:35.317 --> 17:36.816
Look, you want to level up,

17:36.916 --> 17:39.295

I know how to navigate, OK?

it was Carlton's idea.

17:45.791 --> 17:47.051

- Really?

since we've seen him here.

17:48.750 --> 17:50.609
Yeah, well, it wasn't exactly
welcoming last time.

17:50.709 --> 17:52.727
Was it, Drew?
- OK, let's stay on track.

17:52.827 --> 17:55.086
Where were we at?
Soul food potluck fundraiser?

17:55.186 --> 17:57.565
First of all,
OK, sign-up sheet, uh,

17:57.665 --> 17:59.484
'cause I could definitely put
my foot in some baby back ribs.

17:59.584 --> 18:00.563
Hold on.
Not welcoming?

18:00.663 --> 18:02.002
Don't put that on us.

18:02.102 --> 18:03.442
The only time
you showed up

18:03.542 --> 18:04.541
is when you were running
for class president,

18:04.541 --> 18:06.120
and you needed our votes.

18:06.220 --> 18:08.599
All we did was call you out
on it, right?

18:08.699 --> 18:11.397
And after you got elected,
you never came back.

18:11.497 --> 18:12.717
Take it easy.

18:12.817 --> 18:15.195
Well, that's not true.

18:15.295 --> 18:18.593
Really?

18:18.693 --> 18:20.512
OK, look, fine.

18:20.612 --> 18:23.071
But you want to know the
real reason why I don't do BSU?

18:23.171 --> 18:24.210
I don't think we should
disrupt the flow,

18:24.210 --> 18:25.789
right, Madam President?

18:25.889 --> 18:28.028
No, please, speak freely.
Carlton, you have the floor.

18:28.128 --> 18:30.127
Great.

18:31.926 --> 18:36.184
OK, look, I get that we need
a safe space for just us.

18:36.284 --> 18:37.783
And the work you all do
to uplift each other

18:37.883 --> 18:39.542
and the community is great.

18:39.642 --> 18:42.061
But...

18:42.161 --> 18:45.739
But, look, honestly,

18:45.839 --> 18:47.418
you all do
a lot of complaining,

18:47.518 --> 18:49.177
but no one even bothers to show
up for the student town halls

18:49.277 --> 18:50.296
or run for student government

18:50.396 --> 18:52.535
in order to actually
change things.

18:52.635 --> 18:54.734
Look, our voices could

18:54.834 --> 19:00.131
really, really be heard
on stuff that actually matters,

19:00.231 --> 19:02.010
or we could just sit here

19:02.110 --> 19:04.608
and bitch and moan about
why the cafeteria only serves

19:04.708 --> 19:06.168
fried chicken on MLK Day.

19:06.268 --> 19:09.446
OK, so what I think, um,

19:09.546 --> 19:12.724
Carlton was trying to say
is that he would be up for some

19:12.824 --> 19:16.402
bigger ideas if the group
would be down for it.

19:16.502 --> 19:18.121
I know I would.

19:18.221 --> 19:20.160
Yeah, so would I, actually.

19:20.260 --> 19:22.279
We could afford
to be less insular,

19:22.379 --> 19:23.998
shake things up.

19:24.098 --> 19:26.876
And everyone's opinions
are welcome here.

19:26.976 --> 19:29.875
So, Carlton,
keep coming to the meetings.

19:29.975 --> 19:31.874
We'd love to hear
more of your ideas.

19:35.931 --> 19:39.429
OK, so next up,
the reports of officers.

19:39.529 --> 19:41.188
Dante, do you wanna start?

19:41.288 --> 19:43.107
<i>It's great
to have you back, Phil.</i>

19:43.207 --> 19:45.266
<i>It feels good
to be back, James.</i>

19:45.366 --> 19:48.025
Like old times, huh?

19:48.125 --> 19:49.264
Hey, man,
I just want to say I'm sorry

19:49.364 --> 19:51.143
that your DA run
didn't work out.

19:51.243 --> 19:52.822
Oh, it wasn't all in vain,
not at all.

19:52.922 --> 19:56.300
Um, being out there,
talking to people,

19:56.400 --> 19:58.379
really listening,
finding solutions,

19:58.479 --> 20:01.298
you know, it really reminded me
of why we started this firm.

20:01.398 --> 20:04.696
Of course.

20:04.796 --> 20:06.575
There's a lot more
that we should be doing.

20:06.675 --> 20:08.054
You know,
our people are out there

20:08.154 --> 20:10.373
being pushed out of their
neighbourhoods at record rates.

20:10.473 --> 20:11.532
I think that
we should be bringing in

20:11.632 --> 20:13.571
key community leaders
to benefit from

20:13.671 --> 20:16.369
our resources and expertise
to support policy change--

20:16.469 --> 20:18.408
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:18.508 --> 20:21.367
OK, listen, no one--

20:21.467 --> 20:23.286
no one expects you to jump
right into the deep end

20:23.386 --> 20:25.404
that fast.

20:25.504 --> 20:27.203
Well, I want to.
I'm ready.

20:27.303 --> 20:28.843
I'm back!

20:28.943 --> 20:31.921
Yeah, yeah, I mean,
no one expected that either.

20:32.021 --> 20:33.760
Is that a problem?

20:33.860 --> 20:36.718
That--of course not.
This is your firm.

20:36.818 --> 20:38.477
- Our firm.
- Right.

20:38.577 --> 20:41.676
And everything you said
sounds great.

20:41.776 --> 20:42.955
I got to jump into a thing.

20:43.055 --> 20:45.753
But yeah, let's get into this.

20:45.853 --> 20:48.432
And welcome back, bro, OK?

20:48.532 --> 20:49.871
- All right.
- All right, good to see you.

20:49.971 --> 20:51.750
You too.

21:01.005 --> 21:03.104
You know rules are rules,
Ms. Hughes.

21:03.204 --> 21:05.263
I am tired
of not being heard.

21:05.363 --> 21:08.101
I do hear you,
but this isn't the way.

21:08.201 --> 21:09.740
There's a process, Ms. Hughes.

21:09.840 --> 21:13.139
Here we go
with the process again.

21:13.239 --> 21:15.237
Well, what about my stu--

21:29.390 --> 21:31.648
Looking for me?

21:31.748 --> 21:34.567
Yo.

21:34.667 --> 21:37.046
I see you still
in your 007-ish, G.

21:37.146 --> 21:38.045
Yeah.

21:38.145 --> 21:39.444
What's up?

21:39.544 --> 21:40.963
Yo, you a tough guy
to get in contact with.

21:41.063 --> 21:42.203
You look good, man.

21:42.303 --> 21:44.282
Been working out?
Been in the gym?

21:44.382 --> 21:45.561
The benefits
of taking some time

21:45.661 --> 21:47.000
to focus on myself, you know?

21:47.100 --> 21:48.799
We've been in the same boat,

21:48.899 --> 21:51.758
both of us out here solo dolo
'cause of, um, you-know-who.

21:51.858 --> 21:53.317
Mm.

21:53.417 --> 21:57.674
Except one of us
doesn't have to be.

21:57.774 --> 22:00.193
No, I'm good.

22:00.293 --> 22:02.292
Shit, I'm great.

22:04.451 --> 22:07.309
Look, man.

22:07.409 --> 22:11.907
My whole life
was based on a lie.

22:12.007 --> 22:14.785
And Uncle Phil is still
standing by what he did.

22:14.885 --> 22:18.903
Oh, you mean
he's prideful, stubborn,

22:19.003 --> 22:21.301
and can't get out
of his own way, yeah?

22:24.320 --> 22:27.298
I am nothing like that.

22:27.398 --> 22:29.677
Shit, I'm better off
on my own, anyway.

22:32.236 --> 22:35.654
Then why did you call me?

22:35.754 --> 22:38.852
'Cause I needed some advice.

22:38.952 --> 22:42.050
Look, I miss everyone.
I do.

22:42.150 --> 22:45.768
But everything
that went down with my...

22:45.868 --> 22:47.867
Lou...

22:51.385 --> 22:54.284
I can't go back
to the way things were.

22:54.384 --> 22:56.442
The whole thing just made me
want to be more independent,

22:56.542 --> 22:58.541
take control of my life,
you feel me?

23:03.778 --> 23:05.837
It's not that simple, Will.

23:05.937 --> 23:07.996
You still need money,
a place to live.

23:08.096 --> 23:09.555
No, I'm good off all that.

23:09.655 --> 23:11.754
Look, I've been staying with
my boy Jazz in South LA.

23:11.854 --> 23:13.593
And I've been hooping
for money from time to time

23:13.693 --> 23:14.792
when I need it.

23:14.892 --> 23:17.351
I'm good.

23:17.451 --> 23:20.189
Feels like Philly
all over again.

23:20.289 --> 23:23.228
No, it's nothing
like that, G.

23:23.328 --> 23:27.066
Look, man, I actually have a
real plan this time, you know?

23:27.166 --> 23:30.524
I just want to take care
of myself, be a real man.

23:32.443 --> 23:35.061
A real man doesn't
avoid hard things.

23:35.161 --> 23:36.980
He faces what scares him.

23:37.080 --> 23:40.019
South LA may feel like home,
but, really,

23:40.119 --> 23:43.257
it's just another place
to hide.

23:43.357 --> 23:47.295
Your uncle loves you, Will,

23:47.395 --> 23:50.253
enough to fire me.

23:56.670 --> 23:58.569
Talk to him.

24:10.382 --> 24:11.642
639

24:11.742 --> 24:15.659
Phil, look who's here.

24:21.096 --> 24:23.075
- Forgive my intrusion.
- Oh, please.

24:23.175 --> 24:26.713
We're happy to see you.

24:26.813 --> 24:29.432
Well, I'm sure you two have
a lot to talk about, so...

24:29.532 --> 24:31.931
Actually, I'd like
to speak with both of you.

24:34.809 --> 24:37.148
Uh, first off,
I wanted to make sure

24:37.248 --> 24:39.866
that the birthday girl got this
and send my regards.

24:39.966 --> 24:41.785
That's so sweet,
but you're invited.

24:41.885 --> 24:43.504
We're getting ready
to leave soon.

24:43.604 --> 24:45.763
We'd all love to see you there.

24:49.121 --> 24:51.860
Regrettably,
I won't be able to attend.

24:51.960 --> 24:54.658
Understood.

24:54.758 --> 24:58.776
Will reached out to me yesterday.

24:58.876 --> 25:00.175
Of course he did.

25:00.275 --> 25:02.334
Seems like he's reverting
to some of his old ways,

25:02.434 --> 25:04.693
street ball hustling,
stuff like that.

25:04.793 --> 25:06.732
It's clear he's looking
for direction.

25:06.832 --> 25:08.291
The only thing that's clear
is that he doesn't want

25:08.391 --> 25:11.649
to talk to me or come home.

25:11.749 --> 25:14.008
Look, I don't want
to overstep again,

25:14.108 --> 25:16.326
but I thought you should know.

25:16.426 --> 25:19.365
He sees the streets
as a safe haven now.

25:19.465 --> 25:23.023
But I think the sooner you
get him back home, the better.

25:28.460 --> 25:31.878
And one last thing.

25:31.978 --> 25:35.076
I let my personal sensitivities
about my own son

25:35.176 --> 25:37.635
cloud my judgment with Will.

25:37.735 --> 25:39.734
And my actions
were unacceptable.

25:43.132 --> 25:47.370
And what's going on here,
this situation...

25:50.208 --> 25:53.366
It was never my intention
to do harm.

25:59.923 --> 26:02.341
We appreciate the update
on Will, Geoffrey.

26:07.399 --> 26:11.097
I guess I'll walk you
to the door then.

26:34.944 --> 26:37.762
Yo, so you not about to
get ready for Ashley's party?

26:37.862 --> 26:39.721
I'm good. I already know
what I'm going to wear.

26:39.821 --> 26:41.520
And unlike you, I don't use
all that starch on my clothes.

26:43.819 --> 26:46.917
No, all jokes aside, man,
really glad you decided to go.

26:47.017 --> 26:49.316
And you can finally square
things up with your uncle.

26:49.416 --> 26:50.555
If I didn't know any better,

26:50.655 --> 26:51.755
I'd think you were trying
to get rid of me.

26:51.855 --> 26:53.394
Get rid of you?
Why would I do that?

26:54.933 --> 26:56.992
I mean, you know,
I wouldn't mind having my--

26:57.092 --> 26:59.190
my couch back, you know,

26:59.290 --> 27:01.789
my bathroom...

27:01.889 --> 27:04.068
My damn socks?
You got my damn socks on?

27:04.168 --> 27:05.507
On the table, too.
- Hold on.

27:05.607 --> 27:07.146
These are your socks?
- Yeah, those are my socks.

27:07.246 --> 27:08.545
You know they're my socks.
- You lying.

27:11.764 --> 27:13.942
Hey, seriously, man, I just--

27:14.042 --> 27:15.861
I don't like to see you beef
with your family, you know?

27:15.961 --> 27:18.700
Shit, man, I don't even know
what I would say to my uncle.

27:18.800 --> 27:22.138
He can't even admit
he was wrong, you know?

27:22.238 --> 27:24.537
But...

27:24.637 --> 27:27.775
I can't keep
avoiding him, so...

27:27.875 --> 27:29.414
I guess if he's ready, so am I.

27:29.514 --> 27:31.693
Hey, good, 'cause
you know they love you.

27:31.793 --> 27:33.132
And apparently,
everybody's counting

27:33.232 --> 27:34.571
on your ass to be there.

27:34.671 --> 27:36.330
And I promised Hilary
you would not be late,

27:36.430 --> 27:38.769
so don't even play.
- Oh, y'all still going strong?

27:38.869 --> 27:40.128
Strong in secret.

27:40.228 --> 27:42.567
Hmm.

27:42.667 --> 27:44.366
Apparently,
she not ready to commit

27:44.466 --> 27:46.445
or something like that, man.

27:46.545 --> 27:48.164
I wouldn't think
too much into that, bro.

27:48.264 --> 27:49.843
I'm good, bro.

27:49.943 --> 27:51.202
I'm good.
I'ma be all right.

27:51.302 --> 27:52.721
You sure?

27:52.821 --> 27:55.160
Your boy Jazz is keeping
his options wide open.

27:58.019 --> 28:00.197
Shit.

28:00.297 --> 28:01.836
Yo, JB, what's up, bro?

28:01.936 --> 28:03.675
I been hitting you up all day.
What's the word from Doc?

28:03.775 --> 28:05.195
So here's the deal.

28:05.295 --> 28:07.233
Doc's got a B-exhibition game
popping off in Venice.

28:07.333 --> 28:08.833
<i>Now, there ain't
no guarantees,</i>

28:08.933 --> 28:10.752
<i>but you got a shot
to holla at him.</i>

28:10.852 --> 28:12.031
<i>Some of the best hoopers
will be there.</i>

28:12.131 --> 28:13.990
Shit, then I'll be there too.
When is it?

28:14.090 --> 28:15.589
An hour.
Don't fuck it up.

28:15.689 --> 28:16.708
Shit.

28:16.808 --> 28:18.547
Bro, "shit" is
an understatement.

28:18.647 --> 28:20.466
Ain't no way in hell
you about to go to the game

28:20.566 --> 28:23.705
and make the party.

28:23.805 --> 28:26.303
Man, I can make both work.

28:26.403 --> 28:27.542
This won't take me long.

28:27.642 --> 28:29.301
Good, 'cause we got
under 40 minutes.

28:29.401 --> 28:31.061
Just gonna get in his ear
and make an impression.

28:31.161 --> 28:33.739
In under 40 minutes.

28:35.838 --> 28:37.097
<i>♪ If he buyin',
then we get it ♪</i>

28:37.197 --> 28:38.656
<i>♪ Selling glasses
like it's rum ♪</i>

28:38.756 --> 28:40.535
<i>♪ But this is business,
no, you feel this ♪</i>

28:40.635 --> 28:43.974
Yo, that's him right there,
guy in the red.

28:44.074 --> 28:46.652
Hey, man, good luck.

28:46.752 --> 28:48.751
both: Shh.

28:54.548 --> 28:57.326
Excuse me, Doc?

28:57.426 --> 28:58.486
Can I help you
with something?

28:58.586 --> 28:59.845
Yeah, yeah, I'm Will Smith.

28:59.945 --> 29:00.904
I just wanted to
introduce myself.

29:00.904 --> 29:02.523
I used to hoop in Philly.

29:02.623 --> 29:04.362
I was being scouted by
VCU, Nova, Seton Hall.

29:04.462 --> 29:06.601
Yeah, OK.
Next game is about to start.

29:06.701 --> 29:08.440
We can chop it up after.
- Right, that's the thing.

29:08.540 --> 29:11.159
I'm just, respectfully,
kind of in a rush.

29:11.259 --> 29:15.037
Respectfully,
I ain't on your clock, kid.

29:15.137 --> 29:17.315
Yo, let's go, man.
Ball up.

29:17.415 --> 29:19.954
All right, let's do this.

29:20.054 --> 29:22.313
But if you ain't top tier,

29:22.413 --> 29:24.711
stay on the sidelines.

29:24.811 --> 29:27.790
Real hoopers only
'round here, OK?

29:27.890 --> 29:31.748
So I see we got some new blood
ready to earn they stripes.

29:31.848 --> 29:33.906
I don't know,
let's see what you got though.

29:34.006 --> 29:37.624
Better make it worth our while.

29:40.483 --> 29:42.662
Don't be scared.
He's friendly.

29:42.762 --> 29:44.501
Friendly?

29:44.601 --> 29:47.059
What's his name?
Monster? Killer?

29:47.159 --> 29:48.658
Fluffy.

29:48.758 --> 29:50.178
- Fluffy?
- Mm-hmm.

29:50.278 --> 29:52.276
I'm Will.

29:54.795 --> 29:57.933
So I can know your dog's name,
but I can't know yours?

29:58.033 --> 29:59.612
I don't know if I like you
like that yet.

29:59.712 --> 30:00.612
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

30:00.712 --> 30:02.931
OK, all right.

30:03.031 --> 30:04.290
I saw you trying
to talk to Doc.

30:04.390 --> 30:05.929
Oh, you saw that?

30:06.029 --> 30:07.408
You want a little advice?

30:07.508 --> 30:08.967
Mm.

30:09.067 --> 30:10.147
If you're trying to make
a good impression,

30:10.147 --> 30:12.485
don't just talk a good game.

30:12.585 --> 30:15.524
Play one.

30:15.624 --> 30:17.962
Thanks.

30:18.062 --> 30:20.241
How y'all feeling?
Y'all ready?

30:20.341 --> 30:22.600
'Cause it's win or go home
'round here, you feel me?

30:29.296 --> 30:31.275
Oh, my goodness, wait till
you see the big surprise later.

30:31.375 --> 30:32.594
She's gonna love it.

30:32.694 --> 30:34.394
Oh, I'm so happy
you could come.

30:34.494 --> 30:35.913
Oh, you look so beautiful.

30:36.013 --> 30:37.352
Thank you for inviting me.

30:37.452 --> 30:38.511
Oh, come on now.

30:38.611 --> 30:41.310
You're family.

30:41.410 --> 30:44.428
So have you had a chance
to talk to Will?

30:44.528 --> 30:45.827
Not really.

30:48.126 --> 30:50.025
And that's the game!

30:50.125 --> 30:53.183
All right, up next,
we got a open slot,

30:53.283 --> 30:56.222
one-on-one against Big Dre.

30:56.322 --> 30:58.021
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

30:58.121 --> 30:59.780
No challengers?

30:59.880 --> 31:01.379
Yeah! I want that smoke.

31:01.479 --> 31:03.018
What's up with it?

31:03.118 --> 31:06.256
Oh, all right, we got
somebody with heart, yeah.

31:06.356 --> 31:07.775
What's your name, young man?

31:07.875 --> 31:09.934
Oh, yeah, I'm <i>the</i> Will Smith.

31:10.034 --> 31:12.493
Remember that.
- Big talk.

31:12.593 --> 31:14.492
- Yes, ma'am.
- Let's see what you got.

31:14.592 --> 31:17.770
So who's Big Dre?

31:17.870 --> 31:20.049
Big Dre!

31:29.743 --> 31:30.803
Here we go.

31:30.903 --> 31:35.240
Game to 7, win by 2.

31:35.340 --> 31:37.119
- Let's do it.
- Let's rock.

Whoo!

33:16.406 --> 33:17.705
Remember his name.

33:17.805 --> 33:19.544
So did I get your attention
now or what?

33:19.644 --> 33:21.703
Sure, but I already
know who you are.

33:21.803 --> 33:24.101
- You do?
- Checked your stats.

33:24.201 --> 33:27.100
In Philly, you was averaging
25 points a game.

33:27.200 --> 33:29.858
You're only averaging 17
at Bel-Air.

33:29.958 --> 33:31.617
Probably sharing the court
with a bunch of kids

33:31.717 --> 33:33.536
who only get playing time
'cause they daddy's name's

33:33.636 --> 33:35.055
on the gym.

33:35.155 --> 33:35.995
I just need someone
like you to help me

33:35.995 --> 33:38.254
get back to that level.

33:38.354 --> 33:40.732
You got heart,

33:40.832 --> 33:42.811
but I'm not taking on
any new clients right now.

33:42.911 --> 33:47.808
Show up and show down, Timmy!

33:49.548 --> 33:50.687
Hey, come on.

33:50.787 --> 33:52.786
Shit.

33:54.745 --> 33:56.444
Good job out there.

33:56.544 --> 33:58.543
Not good enough.

33:59.702 --> 34:02.920
By the way,

34:03.020 --> 34:05.319
my name is Jackie.

34:05.419 --> 34:07.238
Nice to meet you, Jackie.

34:07.338 --> 34:09.557
I know.

34:09.657 --> 34:12.395
I got to go.
See you, Fluffy.

34:18.092 --> 34:20.231
Get dressed
and buckle up, fool.

34:23.289 --> 34:25.628
No luck.

34:25.728 --> 34:26.907
We can't wait much longer.

34:27.007 --> 34:29.586
He told me he'd be here. Just...

34:29.686 --> 34:32.024
Listen, let's just give him
five more minutes.

34:32.124 --> 34:33.504
All right.

34:33.604 --> 34:34.903
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

34:35.003 --> 34:36.182
Yo, yo, yo, watch out,
watch out, watch out!

34:36.282 --> 34:38.101
Hold on, hold on!

34:38.201 --> 34:40.260
Bro, are you crazy?

34:44.278 --> 34:47.016
Ivy, when I said you could
bring a couple products,

34:47.116 --> 34:48.495
I didn't know that meant
setting up

34:48.595 --> 34:50.534
a whole-ass mall kiosk.

34:50.634 --> 34:52.053
Just got to get it
in front of people,

34:52.153 --> 34:55.851
and it sells itself.

34:55.951 --> 34:59.330
Listen, Ivy, we need to talk
about our partnership, OK?

34:59.430 --> 35:02.048
This can't just be you
telling me what to do.

35:02.148 --> 35:04.427
We're supposed to be equals
in this.

35:06.706 --> 35:10.084
Yeah, equals.

35:10.184 --> 35:11.323
Of course.

35:11.423 --> 35:13.122
You're a boss, Hilary.

35:13.222 --> 35:16.520
I'm just trying
to bring it out.

35:16.620 --> 35:18.679
Hey! We're here!

35:18.779 --> 35:21.278
There he is.
He's here.

35:21.378 --> 35:23.396
Ah!

35:23.496 --> 35:24.796
- Hurry up!
- Hurry up!

35:24.896 --> 35:26.115
I'm creasin' my Voices!

35:26.215 --> 35:27.274
3 o'clock.
We about to leave!

35:27.374 --> 35:29.713
- Hurry!
- We're here!

35:29.813 --> 35:31.752
We're here, hold the boat!
Hold the boat! Hold the boat!

35:33.411 --> 35:35.670
I ain't doing this again.

35:35.770 --> 35:37.229
Isn't that your
cousin's friend

35:37.329 --> 35:38.468
I met at your mum's art show?

35:38.568 --> 35:40.787
Who, Jazz?
Yeah.

35:40.887 --> 35:43.186
- Is he single?
- No.

35:43.286 --> 35:47.064
I mean, I don't know.
It's kind of unclear.

35:47.164 --> 35:50.422
Then I guess I'll have
to get my own answers then.

35:50.522 --> 35:52.381
Okay.

36:00.197 --> 36:02.735
- Will!
- Oh.

36:02.835 --> 36:04.254
I'm so glad you came.

36:04.354 --> 36:05.574
I couldn't miss
getting one last look

36:05.674 --> 36:07.772
at 12-year-old Ashley.

36:07.872 --> 36:10.171
Oh, this is for you.

36:10.271 --> 36:11.370
Hope you like it.

36:11.470 --> 36:12.770
You know,
it ain't a lot, but...

36:15.148 --> 36:17.887
So when I turned 13,
my mum gave me a sketchpad,

36:17.987 --> 36:19.566
and it helped me
express myself.

36:19.666 --> 36:21.285
So I know you're into poetry
and all of that.

36:21.385 --> 36:23.644
So can't wait to see
what you create, cuz.

36:23.744 --> 36:25.363
Thank you, Will.
It's perfect.

36:27.462 --> 36:29.201
All right, go have fun.

36:29.301 --> 36:30.720
What does your
favourite aunt have to do

36:30.820 --> 36:32.919
to get a hug around here?
- What's up?

36:33.019 --> 36:35.038
Oh, I am so happy
to see you, Will.

36:35.138 --> 36:37.476
Oh, the house just isn't
the same without you.

36:37.576 --> 36:38.995
Hey, look,
I really appreciate you

36:39.095 --> 36:41.074
calling me every other hour.

36:41.174 --> 36:43.713
Oh, well, I miss you.

36:43.813 --> 36:46.231
We all do.

36:46.331 --> 36:48.110
- How's your distance with...
- You sure about that?

36:48.210 --> 36:50.689
I know he would love
to talk to you.

36:52.768 --> 36:54.227
Yeah, I haven't
been consistent...

36:54.327 --> 36:55.866
Look, I'm just going
to be here for Ash

36:55.966 --> 36:58.645
and not the drama, all right?

37:34.985 --> 37:36.204

- How you doing?

37:36.304 --> 37:37.803
I'm all right. You know,

37:37.903 --> 37:39.263
being surrounded by all this

37:39.263 --> 37:41.082

Yeah.

37:44.580 --> 37:46.439
So who you mad at,
Jazz or Ivy?

37:46.539 --> 37:47.618
'Cause you look like
you about to stab someone.

37:47.618 --> 37:49.917
I'm not mad at anyone.
Do I look mad?

37:50.017 --> 37:51.956
Just a little salty.

37:52.056 --> 37:54.035
No, me and Jazz are cool.

37:54.135 --> 37:56.034
No jealousy, no drama.

37:56.134 --> 37:58.112
If you say so.

37:58.212 --> 37:59.672
'Cause, Hilary, he talks
about you all the time.

37:59.772 --> 38:01.431
- He does?
- Yes.

38:01.531 --> 38:03.030
He's into you.

38:03.130 --> 38:05.029
Just don't break
my boy's heart, a'ite?

38:05.129 --> 38:07.107
- Will, shut up, OK?
- A'ite.

38:07.207 --> 38:08.787
Just let grown folks
handle grown folks.

38:08.887 --> 38:10.885
My name's business,
and I ain't in it.

38:19.401 --> 38:22.539
Hey, uh, Mum's trying
to start a Soul Train line,

38:22.639 --> 38:25.857
and I think you're the only one
that can stop her.

38:25.957 --> 38:28.116
There's no stopping that.

38:30.235 --> 38:31.454
Is everything OK?

38:31.554 --> 38:33.253
Yeah.

38:33.353 --> 38:35.292
Yeah, I just needed
a little quiet time.

38:35.392 --> 38:37.251
Oh, good,
because I thought

38:37.351 --> 38:40.249
you were over here
trying to hide from Will.

38:40.349 --> 38:42.288
I'm not hiding.

38:42.388 --> 38:44.927
Tonight isn't about
me and Will.

38:45.027 --> 38:48.045
It's about Ashley.

38:48.145 --> 38:51.283
Tonight's about
celebrating as a family.

38:51.383 --> 38:53.562
And it meant enough to Will
for him to show up,

38:53.662 --> 38:56.321
despite everything going on
between you two.

39:08.654 --> 39:10.973
You up for talking?

39:16.210 --> 39:18.529
I don't really
got nothing to say.

39:20.528 --> 39:22.946
OK.

39:23.046 --> 39:25.305
You up for listening?

39:31.362 --> 39:33.461
1012

39:33.561 --> 39:34.860
<i>If you remember, Will,</i>

39:34.960 --> 39:36.379
<i>when you first came
to live with us,</i>

39:36.479 --> 39:39.137
I told you a real man makes
choices he has to live with.

39:39.237 --> 39:40.897
Great, so this is just
another lecture about

39:40.997 --> 39:43.375
the poor decisions
that I've been making?

39:43.475 --> 39:46.853
No.

39:46.953 --> 39:49.012
No, it's about me
owning up to mine.

39:51.671 --> 39:55.409
Been thinking about why
I can't apologise,

39:55.509 --> 39:58.307
even though, apparently,
everyone wants me to.

40:00.986 --> 40:03.684
I just don't regret wanting
to protect you, Will.

40:03.784 --> 40:05.763
I wanted to keep Lou
from hurting you.

40:08.022 --> 40:10.760
I mean, to be honest,
I don't really know Lou.

40:10.860 --> 40:13.279
So the fact that he
turned out to be a bum

40:13.379 --> 40:15.838
doesn't surprise me.

40:15.938 --> 40:19.735
But that my mum, Aunt Viv, and
you lied to me my whole life?

40:22.134 --> 40:24.393
That's what hurt.

40:27.931 --> 40:32.029
You put your trust in me,
and I let you down.

40:32.129 --> 40:35.027
And for that, I owe you
an overdue apology, Will.

40:38.725 --> 40:41.124
I'm sorry.

40:45.601 --> 40:49.419
Thank you.

40:49.519 --> 40:53.577
I know you've been trying to
find your own way in South LA.

40:55.396 --> 40:58.934
It hasn't gone exactly
how I planned it.

40:59.034 --> 41:02.092
Well, I'm still here
for you and your dreams,

41:02.192 --> 41:06.210
so if you're ready
to come home,

41:06.310 --> 41:09.388
I promise you, we can
figure it all out together.

41:11.148 --> 41:13.726
I love you, Will.

41:13.826 --> 41:17.204
I love you, too, Uncle Phil.

41:29.897 --> 41:31.716
All right, Ashley,
time for the big surprise.

41:31.816 --> 41:35.314
All right, you guys, can I have
everyone's attention please?

41:35.414 --> 41:38.473
As you know,
the beautiful Miss Ashley

41:38.573 --> 41:40.631
is the last of the Banks
to be celebrating

41:40.731 --> 41:43.910
the grand tradition
of turning 13.

41:45.569 --> 41:47.068
And what better way
to celebrate

41:47.168 --> 41:49.067
than with a woman
who knows everything

41:49.167 --> 41:51.346
about being untraditional?

41:51.446 --> 41:56.343
Ladies and gentlemen, my friend,
the poppin' Saweetie!

41:56.443 --> 41:58.142
That's right!

41:58.242 --> 42:00.940
Happy birthday.

42:01.040 --> 42:03.059
Girl, Hilary told me
you are a big fan,

42:03.159 --> 42:05.138
but I'm a bigger fan of you.

42:05.238 --> 42:06.817
And I just want to say...

42:06.917 --> 42:11.335
all:

42:11.435 --> 42:16.092
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

42:16.192 --> 42:20.650

42:22.429 --> 42:26.726

42:29.545 --> 42:32.104
Make a wish, Ashley.
Make a wish.

42:33.743 --> 42:35.402
It already came true.

42:35.502 --> 42:37.501
Aww.
Come on. I'll help you.

42:42.218 --> 42:44.317
All right, y'all.
Let's get this party poppin'.

42:49.894 --> 42:52.033

42:52.133 --> 42:54.591

<i>♪ I'm only fuckin' with

42:58.489 --> 43:02.027
You know, I meant it
when I said I loved you.

43:02.127 --> 43:04.586
- Will.
- But...

43:04.686 --> 43:06.305
Lisa, ever since
I moved to Bel-Air,

43:06.405 --> 43:09.983
everything has been
going so fast, and I...

43:10.083 --> 43:11.462
I just jumped in
without thinking.

43:11.562 --> 43:13.221
And that includes us?

43:13.321 --> 43:16.539
Lisa...

43:16.639 --> 43:19.937
Look, I know I hurt you
when I lied, and I'm sorry.

43:20.037 --> 43:23.576
I'm sorry.

43:23.676 --> 43:27.533
But you know your pops has
never liked me from the jump.

43:27.633 --> 43:28.853
I'm just some kid from Philly

43:28.953 --> 43:30.112
who's never going
to be enough for his daughter.

43:30.112 --> 43:31.611
Since when do you care
what he thinks?

43:31.711 --> 43:36.928
Since I'm done hiding
and apologising for who I am.

43:37.028 --> 43:40.806
I'm trying to figure out a lot.

43:40.906 --> 43:44.004
And I don't want to bring you
in anymore drama.

43:44.104 --> 43:47.642
So what are you saying, Will?

43:47.742 --> 43:51.360
I'm saying that...

43:51.460 --> 43:56.438
that if it's meant to be,
then it'll be.

43:56.538 --> 43:58.876
But for now,

43:58.976 --> 44:01.315
I think we need
to take a break.

44:03.654 --> 44:06.112
I'm sorry.

44:22.244 --> 44:24.882
I love you, too.

44:28.560 --> 44:29.820
1107

44:29.920 --> 44:31.698
Yeah, OK, OK.

44:31.798 --> 44:33.617
Move.

44:33.717 --> 44:35.736
I thought Ashley said
no presents this year.

44:35.836 --> 44:37.735
Yeah, I did, repeatedly.

44:37.835 --> 44:39.334
We'll get the rest
out of the car tomorrow.

44:39.434 --> 44:40.774
Tonight was so much fun.

44:40.874 --> 44:42.573
I may just want to turn
13 again next year.

44:42.673 --> 44:44.651
Hey, I turn 35 every year.

44:44.751 --> 44:46.450
- 35?
- Son.

44:46.550 --> 44:48.549
I mean, I see no lies.
What?

44:52.667 --> 44:54.046
You know, it really
was a fun night.

44:54.146 --> 44:57.724
Oh, it was so much fun.

44:57.824 --> 45:00.043
I think I'm gonna need you
to carry me upstairs now.

45:00.143 --> 45:02.762
Oh, I was about to ask you
the same thing.

45:02.862 --> 45:04.241
Ooh.

45:09.018 --> 45:11.277
You know, you all should
really start locking the door

45:11.377 --> 45:14.075
because anybody could just
walk up in here.

45:14.175 --> 45:16.354
I hope those bags mean
what I think they mean.

45:16.454 --> 45:17.793
They do.

45:17.893 --> 45:20.072
I'm ready to come home.

45:20.172 --> 45:22.251
Welcome back!

45:25.090 --> 45:26.749
It's good to have you back, nephew.

45:26.849 --> 45:27.868
Glad to be back.

45:30.966 --> 45:32.146
Well, let me help you
with your bags.

45:32.246 --> 45:33.505
- Oh, please.
- Yes, come on.

45:33.605 --> 45:34.784
I got the rest.
It's cool. It's all right.

45:34.884 --> 45:36.103
Yeah, this is me right here.
- OK.

45:41.800 --> 45:43.420
Appreciate the help, Jazz.

45:43.520 --> 45:45.778
Such a gentleman.

45:45.878 --> 45:47.977
Isn't he?
- No problem, ladies.

45:48.077 --> 45:51.135
Girl, your family knows
how to throw a party, OK?

45:51.235 --> 45:52.694
And I didn't know
you knew Saweetie.

45:52.794 --> 45:55.133
Yeah, we connected when her
cooking videos went viral.

45:55.233 --> 45:56.972
Hey, yo,
and she is dope as hell.

45:57.072 --> 45:58.811
Look, check out
this picture we took.

45:58.911 --> 46:01.450
Oh, shit, Jazz.
She's holding my bottle.

46:01.550 --> 46:04.968
This is just the promo
I need for my IG.

46:05.068 --> 46:06.247
You did this for me?

46:06.347 --> 46:07.446
No, actually,
she was just thirsty,

46:07.546 --> 46:08.726
so I handed her
a bottle, you know?

46:08.826 --> 46:10.965
You're the best.

46:11.065 --> 46:14.603
All right, Ivy,
I can't do this anymore.

46:14.703 --> 46:17.961
Jazz isn't single, OK?
We're dating.

46:18.061 --> 46:19.400
- We are?
- You are?

46:19.500 --> 46:21.999
Why didn't you say so?

46:22.099 --> 46:24.917
Because...

46:25.017 --> 46:26.676
I was sleeping on a good thing

46:26.776 --> 46:29.235
when it was staring at me
the whole damn time.

46:31.374 --> 46:34.392
Jazz, I'm feeling you,

46:34.492 --> 46:37.750
and I know
you're feeling me, too.

46:37.850 --> 46:39.869
I want you to be my man.

46:39.969 --> 46:41.508
Hell yeah.

46:47.964 --> 46:51.303
OK, awkward.

46:51.403 --> 46:53.302
But I'ma let it go 'cause

46:53.402 --> 46:56.460
y'all are actually
kind of cute together.

47:03.636 --> 47:04.855
Ah, you're still working?

47:04.955 --> 47:06.055
I thought
you'd be in bed by now.

47:06.155 --> 47:08.573
My magazine article
just posted.

47:08.673 --> 47:10.732
Already?
That's great.

47:10.832 --> 47:12.531
Not really.
Look at this.

47:12.631 --> 47:14.410
"What's old is new again,
thanks to Reid Broderick

47:14.510 --> 47:15.769
"and his talent
for rediscovering

47:15.869 --> 47:18.328
yet another forgotten artist."

47:18.428 --> 47:21.886
This entire thing makes me into
some side piece to his genius.

47:21.986 --> 47:23.125
What happened
to all your quotes about

47:23.225 --> 47:24.884
helping new artists?
- Not even mentioned.

47:24.984 --> 47:27.003
It's all about Reid
and his vision,

47:27.103 --> 47:29.562
which isn't mine.

47:29.662 --> 47:31.481
This is your fellowship.

47:31.581 --> 47:33.240
He doesn't get to control
what you do with it.

47:33.340 --> 47:35.279
Right?

47:35.379 --> 47:37.198
Do I need to
remind him of that?

47:37.298 --> 47:39.077
No. Thanks, love.
I got this one.

47:39.177 --> 47:42.715
But you better believe his ass
will be hearing from me.

47:42.815 --> 47:46.073
Whoo.
Back home where you belong.

47:46.173 --> 47:47.632
You know, it's going to be
just like the good old days.

47:47.732 --> 47:48.791
You mean back when
you wanted to put me

47:48.891 --> 47:50.630
on the first flight
back to Philly?

47:50.730 --> 47:51.830
Like those good old days?

47:51.930 --> 47:54.148
Hey, it's a fresh start.

47:54.248 --> 47:55.748
I don't know, I just feel like

47:55.848 --> 47:58.306
I'm in a really, really
good place right now.

47:58.406 --> 47:59.526
Maybe you pushing me
out of my comfort zone

47:59.526 --> 48:00.865
was exactly what I needed.

48:00.965 --> 48:02.504
You're welcome.

48:02.604 --> 48:04.383
You can show your gratitude
by helping a brother unpack.

48:04.483 --> 48:06.382
Ah, ooh, look at the time.

48:06.482 --> 48:07.741
It's just so--
- Wow.

48:07.841 --> 48:09.580
- I'm so sleepy.
- Really? Come on.

48:09.680 --> 48:12.199
I thought we was family!
- Goodnight, Will.

48:28.910 --> 48:30.209
Yo, who this?

48:30.309 --> 48:32.088
Yo, Will, it's Doc.

48:32.188 --> 48:33.687
Yo, what's up?

48:33.787 --> 48:35.886
You impressed me today, kid.

48:35.986 --> 48:38.045
Like I said,
your stats ain't great,

48:38.145 --> 48:40.163
but I'm down to check out
your next game.

48:40.263 --> 48:41.523
Wait, for real?

48:41.623 --> 48:43.482
I want to see
that West Philly show up.

48:43.582 --> 48:45.041
<i>Not Bel-Air.</i>
- Oh, hell yeah.

48:45.141 --> 48:46.560
I'ma bring it.
<i>- Cool.</i>

48:46.660 --> 48:48.839
Lock in my number.
I'll be in touch.

48:48.939 --> 48:50.158
OK, bet.

48:50.258 --> 48:51.997
Hey, Doc,
I appreciate you, man.

48:52.097 --> 48:54.096
Thanks.

48:56.735 --> 48:58.733
Yes!

49:02.851 --> 49:05.550
Glad you decided
to give him a second look.

49:08.608 --> 49:13.026
I like him, even though
he's not my typical kinda kid.

49:13.126 --> 49:16.384
And...

49:16.484 --> 49:20.302
first impressions ain't always
what they seem.

49:29.797 --> 49:31.616
Guess not.

49:31.716 --> 49:33.375
Man.
