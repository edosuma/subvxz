and give your weapons
to Bart and Terry.

25:09.174 --> 25:11.242
Don't do it.
You must be out
of your fucking mind.

25:11.243 --> 25:14.345
You can take your ass
on over to Quality Inn
if it's still there, Shaq.

25:14.346 --> 25:15.404
Huh?

25:15.648 --> 25:17.138
Wanna do that?

25:18.350 --> 25:19.613
Let's go.

25:21.020 --> 25:23.216
Hey, don't give
him that gun.

25:29.595 --> 25:30.687

25:34.633 --> 25:35.800
Smart move.

25:35.801 --> 25:38.236

Nobody seems to know
what's going on.

25:38.237 --> 25:42.473
There's a lot of blood.
We have bodies.
There's a slew of fires.

25:42.474 --> 25:45.000
We're back to
a live picture now.

25:52.384 --> 25:54.218
All right.
Can I get one second here?

25:54.219 --> 25:56.347
Ma'am, are you American?

26:01.627 --> 26:03.652
All right.
Let's go, guys.

26:04.897 --> 26:07.065
Come on.

26:07.066 --> 26:08.727
Come on. Let's go.

26:11.370 --> 26:14.704
Excuse me, please.
Is there a restroom?

26:15.240 --> 26:17.209
No. You're staying here.

26:17.810 --> 26:19.377
So then why don't you
tell us which spot in here

26:19.378 --> 26:21.437
you'd like us
to take a piss.

26:24.516 --> 26:26.951
All right. It's around
the corner, that way.

26:26.952 --> 26:29.554
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where do you think
you're going?

26:29.555 --> 26:31.989

anywhere alone. Come on.

26:31.990 --> 26:33.091
Oh, well,
"She's not going any..."

26:33.092 --> 26:34.926

nursery school.

with 23V Cable News.

26:40.065 --> 26:41.566
I'm at one
of the collection depots

26:41.567 --> 26:44.669
waiting on an interview
with Sheriff Cahill.

26:44.670 --> 26:46.838
I understand you're
having a difficult time
killing these things.

26:46.839 --> 26:48.606
Just shoot them
in the head.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.108
They seem to go
down permanently

26:50.109 --> 26:51.342
when you shoot them
in the head.

26:51.343 --> 26:53.878
Then you gotta burn them.
We gotta burn...

Put another round
in that woman over there!

cool motherfucker.

gonna stop on its own.
I need to stitch his arm.

a fucking doctor?

27:09.995 --> 27:11.963
No, I'm a fucking nurse.

27:15.234 --> 27:17.301
I know some of these people
that we're putting down...

in the security office.

27:19.671 --> 27:21.873
What are you gonna do?
It's gotta be done.

27:21.874 --> 27:24.175
Huh? What did I
tell you, boys?

27:24.176 --> 27:27.578
Get those bodies
off the truck!
Haven't got all day here!

27:27.579 --> 27:30.014

its shit out.

27:39.658 --> 27:43.094
You know, you're lucky.
They could have bitten it off.

28:01.346 --> 28:05.049
Yes, I believe
you're referring to a report
that came in this morning.

28:05.050 --> 28:06.784
But that report
was completely...

What can you tell the people
out there watching TV

28:08.520 --> 28:11.055
that don't know what to do?

28:11.056 --> 28:13.758
What I would suggest
is that you come
to Fort Pastor.

28:13.759 --> 28:14.926
And if you can't
make it here,

28:14.927 --> 28:16.494
we have multiple
search-and-rescue teams

28:16.495 --> 28:18.729
out there
and they will find you.

28:18.730 --> 28:20.460
My brother's there.

28:20.699 --> 28:22.463
He's waiting for me.

What's the hold up,
darling?

28:47.493 --> 28:48.721
Hmm?

28:54.633 --> 28:56.362
So what's the plan?

28:56.668 --> 28:59.729
The plan is you drink
a nice tall glass
of shut the fuck up.

29:01.173 --> 29:03.107
MICHAEL: Okay.
That's one idea.

29:04.276 --> 29:06.878
What about locking
this place down?

29:06.879 --> 29:09.245
'Cause sooner or later,
they're going to get in here.
Mmm.

29:10.749 --> 29:13.050
That's good.
Like I hadn't thought of that.

29:13.051 --> 29:14.151
MICHAEL: Hey, no doubt.

29:14.152 --> 29:18.222
And you probably
already thought about
putting a sign up on the roof.

29:18.223 --> 29:21.489
Because, you know,
there's still planes
in the air.

29:21.827 --> 29:24.660
Might be good.
Let them know we're alive.

29:36.508 --> 29:39.076
We can get some paint
from Case Hardware.

29:39.077 --> 29:41.579
We need some office doors
to board up the weak spots.

29:41.580 --> 29:44.572
That's a solid plan.
C.J., is it?

you made in Metropolis?

at Ben Cozine.

them in the head.

that aren't true.

Well, fuck the fucker.
I told him not
to go downstairs.
