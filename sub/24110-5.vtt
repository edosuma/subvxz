00:01.827 --> 00:03.394
My name is Dylan Reinhart.
Not too long ago,

00:03.438 --> 00:07.181
I was an operative in the CIA
known as Agent Reinhart.

00:07.224 --> 00:08.486
When I left the Agency
and started teaching,

00:08.530 --> 00:11.185
I became Professor Reinhart.

00:11.228 --> 00:12.969
I wrote a book about abnormal behavior in criminals,

00:13.013 --> 00:14.449
which was so successful,

00:14.492 --> 00:17.060
a serial killer used it
as clues for his murders.

00:17.104 --> 00:19.758
That's when the New York Police Department reached out to me

00:19.802 --> 00:21.847
to help catch him, which I did.

00:21.891 --> 00:25.199
So they hired me, and I became
Consultant Reinhart.

00:25.242 --> 00:27.157
So now I'm working
with this woman,

00:27.201 --> 00:28.854
Detective Lizzie Needham
of the homicide division,

00:28.898 --> 00:31.161
catching killers.

00:31.205 --> 00:32.945
Looks like I need a new name.

00:32.989 --> 00:34.686
Don't they call you
Professor Psychopath?

00:37.820 --> 00:38.777
WOMAN:
Hey, it's me.

00:38.821 --> 00:40.170
WOMAN 2 :
Hey.

00:40.214 --> 00:41.911
I-I need a favor,
and you're not gonna like it.

00:41.954 --> 00:42.912
Uh

00:42.955 --> 00:44.783
Tell Dad I can't meet.

00:44.827 --> 00:48.222
Tell him I have a test
and, uh, I need to study.

00:48.265 --> 00:50.398
Why

00:50.441 --> 00:52.530
Don't worry.
I promise I'll...

00:52.574 --> 00:53.879
tell him what's going on soon.

00:53.923 --> 00:55.838
What's going on?
Are you okay?

00:55.881 --> 00:57.013
Love you.

00:57.057 --> 00:59.015
I love you.

01:01.713 --> 01:05.413
MAN:
We have a homicide
by drowning, possibly.

01:13.334 --> 01:16.206
MAN 2:
Just brought in
a female Caucasian, mid-40s.

01:24.649 --> 01:27.043
Good morning,
my assembled prodigies.

01:27.087 --> 01:31.003
All you former class presidents
and valedictorians,

01:31.047 --> 01:34.964
all you type A go-getters
and relentless overachievers.

01:35.007 --> 01:36.835
If you're here
for Abnormal Behavior

01:36.879 --> 01:39.969
or Intro to Psychopaths,
you've come to the right spot.

01:40.012 --> 01:42.667
If not, now would be a good time
to escape. Any questions?

01:44.887 --> 01:47.019
Yes

01:47.063 --> 01:48.934
Phoebe.Okay, Phoebe.

01:48.978 --> 01:50.240
Asking if there were
any questions

01:50.284 --> 01:52.068
was kind of
a rhetorical question,

01:52.112 --> 01:54.157
because I haven't actually
taught you anything yet today,

01:54.201 --> 01:55.637
so there shouldn't be any need

01:55.680 --> 01:57.552
to ask anything.Sorry.

01:57.595 --> 01:58.988
No.

01:59.031 --> 02:02.905
Psychopaths make up one percent
of the population,

02:02.948 --> 02:04.994
which means
there are two of them

02:05.037 --> 02:07.344
in this classroom right now.

02:07.388 --> 02:09.477
Maybe sitting right next to you.

02:09.520 --> 02:12.915
In a university
of 16,000 students,

02:12.958 --> 02:16.919
that means
there are 160 psychopaths

02:16.962 --> 02:20.923
roaming the campus
at any given time.

02:20.966 --> 02:23.055
Enjoy your walk to lunch.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.589
I've studied killers
who have amputated limbs,

02:34.632 --> 02:36.895
removed eyeballs,
even an entire lung once,

02:36.939 --> 02:38.114
but a heart?

02:38.158 --> 02:40.116
What kind of person
removes a heart?

02:40.160 --> 02:41.944
Someone without
one of their own?

02:41.987 --> 02:43.946
Killer whales prey
on great white sharks

02:43.989 --> 02:45.948
off of South Africa,
and get this--

02:45.991 --> 02:48.559
the sharks have their livers
and hearts removed

02:48.603 --> 02:50.953
by the whales
with almost surgical precision.

02:50.996 --> 02:52.781
Whereas human
predatory techniques

02:52.824 --> 02:54.478
don't develop
because of hunger.

02:54.522 --> 02:55.914
So, the killer is an orca?

02:55.958 --> 02:57.525
Is that the takeaway
from your story?

02:57.568 --> 02:58.874
MAN:
The other ambulances are clear.

02:59.962 --> 03:01.790
HARRIS: Jane Doe
isn't only missing her heart.

03:01.833 --> 03:03.966
No wallet, no phone, no I.D.

03:04.009 --> 03:06.664
Why would anyone steal a heart?

03:06.708 --> 03:08.013
HARRIS:
Black market organ ring?

03:08.057 --> 03:10.015
Ah, people may pay for
hearts in the U.S.;

03:10.059 --> 03:11.843
they tend to go
overseas to get 'em.

03:11.887 --> 03:14.106
Last night, it
was 80 degrees.

03:14.150 --> 03:16.108
Hardly leather
jacket weather.

03:16.152 --> 03:18.502
Maybe it was new and
she was showing it off,

03:18.546 --> 03:19.982
or maybe it wasn't hers.

03:20.025 --> 03:22.202
The jacket isn't cheap,
but her jeans and shoes

03:22.245 --> 03:23.899
look low-rent.

03:26.423 --> 03:28.425
LIZZIE:
Oh, that's a Gemma Kadin.

03:28.469 --> 03:30.035
A designer downtown.

03:35.693 --> 03:37.173
That is a great suit.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.000
Thank you.

03:38.043 --> 03:39.088
Tom Ford, 2016?

03:39.131 --> 03:40.611
Marshalls, last month.

03:40.655 --> 03:42.483
Detective Needham.

03:42.526 --> 03:44.441
I need the name
of the customer

03:44.485 --> 03:46.313
who purchased a number three
in this jacket.

03:46.356 --> 03:47.314
CLERK:
Yes, of course.

03:47.357 --> 03:48.706
I'll get that for you.

03:48.750 --> 03:51.318
We are literally
the fashion police.

03:51.361 --> 03:54.277
So, the jacket was
purchased by Frank Fallon

03:54.321 --> 03:55.887
on April 6.

03:55.931 --> 03:59.064
I delivered it
to his daughter, Maggie.

04:03.068 --> 04:06.376
LIZZIE:
I have to warn you,
this picture is graphic.

04:06.420 --> 04:08.465
Is this Maggie?

04:10.685 --> 04:12.339
Yes, that's her.

04:12.382 --> 04:14.123
LIZZIE:
Mr. Fallon?

04:14.166 --> 04:15.559
I'm Detective Needham.

04:15.603 --> 04:17.039
This is Dylan Reinhart.

04:17.082 --> 04:19.215
Uh, your office told
us you'd be here.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.435
Yeah, I eat here every day.
Here, sit down. Join me.

04:21.478 --> 04:25.308
Onishi! Two more Onishi
rolls for my friends here.

04:25.352 --> 04:27.049
Best sushi chef
in New York City.

04:29.007 --> 04:30.661
LIZZIE:
Um, is there somewhere

04:30.705 --> 04:32.054
we can talk in private?

04:32.097 --> 04:33.229
There has been
an incident

04:33.273 --> 04:35.231
regarding your
daughter, Maggie.

04:40.062 --> 04:42.064
I was supposed
to see her Friday.

04:42.107 --> 04:44.849
We eat lunch here
every Friday.

04:46.851 --> 04:50.464
Mr. Fallon, we're gonna
need you to identify her.

04:50.507 --> 04:52.422
You mean to look at her?

04:52.466 --> 04:54.990
No, I can't.

04:55.033 --> 04:57.384
Okay. Okay.

04:57.427 --> 05:00.300
How about we go
by Maggie's apartment first?

05:02.954 --> 05:04.521
Dad?

05:04.565 --> 05:06.958
Maggie. Maggie, Maggie!

05:07.002 --> 05:08.656
What are you doing here?

05:08.699 --> 05:10.962
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

05:13.008 --> 05:15.097
â™ª

05:24.715 --> 05:26.500
MAGGIE:
Her name's Amy. Amy Jenkins.

05:26.543 --> 05:28.589
How do you know Amy?

05:28.632 --> 05:31.983
We met online after she saw
my post on Stay B and C.

05:32.027 --> 05:33.811
She was flying in
from Ohio for the week,

05:33.855 --> 05:36.205
wanted to rent out
my spare bedroom, but...

05:36.248 --> 05:38.599
why is she wearing
my jacket?

05:38.642 --> 05:40.818
She obviously
stole it.

05:40.862 --> 05:42.124
LIZZIE:
Did Amy mention any friends,

05:42.167 --> 05:43.604
family she was here to see?

05:43.647 --> 05:44.909
She said she didn't know anyone.

05:44.953 --> 05:46.215
How about any places

05:46.258 --> 05:47.521
she wanted to go?

05:47.564 --> 05:48.913
MAGGIE:
She came in late.

05:48.957 --> 05:50.698
I gave her a key,
and I never saw her again.

05:50.741 --> 05:52.047
FRANK:
I can't believe you're still

05:52.090 --> 05:53.657
renting your room
to strangers.

05:53.701 --> 05:54.919
MAGGIE:
I'm paying it forward.

05:54.963 --> 05:56.486
I have so much.

05:56.530 --> 05:57.661
Thanks to my father.

05:57.705 --> 05:59.402
He'd do anything for me.

05:59.446 --> 06:01.056
FRANK: She rents a room
on one of these websites

06:01.099 --> 06:03.014
but ends up giving
the money back

06:03.058 --> 06:04.668
to the kids in need.

06:04.712 --> 06:06.888
I can't believe she's dead.

06:06.931 --> 06:08.672
I'll need to see Amy's
Stay B and C profile,

06:08.716 --> 06:10.239
any of her things,
as well as

06:10.282 --> 06:12.154
all the e-mails exchanged
between you two.

06:13.242 --> 06:14.635
DYLAN:
Psst!

06:16.724 --> 06:18.900
Excuse me.FRANK: Yeah.

06:20.336 --> 06:21.555
Something isn't adding up.

06:21.598 --> 06:23.078
This murder is way too personal.

06:23.121 --> 06:25.863
If Amy didn't know
anybody in New York City,

06:25.907 --> 06:28.388
why would a stranger want
to cut out her heart?

06:28.431 --> 06:29.606
They do look similar--
which explains

06:29.650 --> 06:31.739
why the shopgirl made a bad I.D.

06:31.782 --> 06:32.870
And the cross-race effect.

06:32.914 --> 06:34.524
People of one race often

06:34.568 --> 06:36.483
misidentify people
of other races.

06:36.526 --> 06:39.703
The chances of a mistaken I.D.
go up about 50%.

06:39.747 --> 06:41.662
So maybe they were after Maggie
and got Amy instead.

06:41.705 --> 06:43.446
They look alike.

06:43.490 --> 06:45.361
She was wearing her jacket,
staying in her place.

06:45.405 --> 06:48.582
The question is-- why would
someone want Maggie dead?

06:52.977 --> 06:54.283
MAGGIE:
Found it.

06:54.326 --> 06:56.154
Here you go.LIZZIE: Thanks.

06:57.591 --> 07:00.768
Somebody's been showing you
some unwanted attention.

07:00.811 --> 07:03.074
I'm guessing,
inside that cellophane,

07:03.118 --> 07:04.336
there are some flowers.

07:04.380 --> 07:05.990
And judging by the...

07:06.034 --> 07:08.558
faint whiff of rhodinol
and sour milk,

07:08.602 --> 07:12.257
I'm going to guess roses
and baby's breath.

07:12.301 --> 07:13.737
Thank you.

07:15.522 --> 07:17.480
No one throws away
fresh flowers.

07:17.524 --> 07:20.657
Unless they didn't want them
in the first place.

07:20.701 --> 07:23.834
You recently installed two
new locks on your front door.

07:23.878 --> 07:26.794
Or your painters did
a superb job everywhere

07:26.837 --> 07:29.797
except for the area
around your locks.

07:29.840 --> 07:31.712
The shades on your windows
are bottom up,

07:31.755 --> 07:33.583
suggesting you don't want anyone
on the street

07:33.627 --> 07:35.324
seeing into your loft.
Maggie...

07:36.543 --> 07:38.283
Do you have a stalker?

07:39.720 --> 07:40.677
FRANK:
What?

07:40.721 --> 07:41.635
Why didn't you tell me?

07:41.678 --> 07:43.071
I would've handled it.

07:43.114 --> 07:44.768
That's why I didn't tell you.

07:44.812 --> 07:46.117
I knew you'd
go crazy.

07:46.161 --> 07:47.597
Do you know your stalker?

07:47.641 --> 07:49.686
I've never seen him.

07:49.730 --> 07:51.862
Does he send you anything
other than flowers?

07:51.906 --> 07:53.429
He sends photos.

07:53.473 --> 07:54.822
I complained
to the local precinct last week

07:54.865 --> 07:55.910
and gave them the pictures.

07:55.953 --> 07:57.520
Pictures of what?

07:57.564 --> 07:58.913
Me.

08:00.654 --> 08:03.265
Was it my heart
he was after?

08:04.571 --> 08:05.746
Did you notice how the dad,

08:05.789 --> 08:07.225
who looks like a
shark, didn't react

08:07.269 --> 08:08.923
when two cops showed
up to talk to him?

08:08.966 --> 08:10.402
You're not a cop.

08:10.446 --> 08:12.013
Hey. I'm cop-ish.

08:12.056 --> 08:13.623
I'll check if he
has a record.

08:13.667 --> 08:14.885
I never would
have thought

08:14.929 --> 08:16.539
that guy would be
such a loving father

08:16.583 --> 08:18.019
after getting a look
at his pinky ring.

08:18.062 --> 08:20.238
I guess you can't judge
a man by his pinky ring.

08:20.282 --> 08:21.544
Yes, you can.

08:21.588 --> 08:22.980
It's a guy with a pinky ring.

08:23.024 --> 08:24.721
Can we stop talking
about pinky rings

08:24.765 --> 08:26.418
and go and find our stalker?

08:26.462 --> 08:28.029
Follow me.

08:38.692 --> 08:40.215
Wow. Nice Harley.

08:40.258 --> 08:41.608
It's Detective Fucci's.

08:41.651 --> 08:43.653
He loves it more
than his children.

08:43.697 --> 08:45.002
Much more.

08:45.046 --> 08:46.961
The precinct where Maggie
filed her stalker report

08:47.004 --> 08:48.658
is going to e-mail the photos.

08:48.702 --> 08:50.791
Don't tell anyone to
follow you ever again.

08:50.834 --> 08:52.575
I'm surprised
you weren't pulled over.

08:52.619 --> 08:55.752
As your boss, all I can say is--
get used to it.

08:55.796 --> 08:57.145
Boss?

08:57.188 --> 08:59.147
You should know
I have a thing

08:59.190 --> 09:00.801
with authority.

09:00.844 --> 09:02.193
Then I'm ordering you
to get over it.

09:07.764 --> 09:10.724
Lieutenant Gooden, um,
just out of curiosity,

09:10.767 --> 09:12.813
when do I get one of those
permits that allows me

09:12.856 --> 09:14.684
to park wherever I want?He's joking.

09:14.728 --> 09:16.556
No... no, I'm not.
I'd really like one.

09:18.775 --> 09:20.255
Oh, and we got Maggie's photos

09:20.298 --> 09:22.518
from the 21st, the
local precinct.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.564
I think we found our stalker.

09:25.739 --> 09:27.610
They're taken over
a period of six weeks,

09:27.654 --> 09:29.133
but all from
the same vantage point.

09:29.177 --> 09:31.179
He's got to live
or work there.

09:31.222 --> 09:32.615
And you're sure
there's only one

09:32.659 --> 09:34.095
Caldo Freddo coffee
in Manhattan?

09:34.138 --> 09:36.488
Yeah, it's where Andy
buys all our coffee.

09:36.532 --> 09:38.055
My bike-- I...

09:38.099 --> 09:40.971
I-I parked it just there.

09:41.015 --> 09:42.407
How did it...

09:42.451 --> 09:44.758
Oh... idiots.

09:44.801 --> 09:46.107
Oh, I see.

09:46.150 --> 09:47.674
I'm being hazed.I'll talk to 'em.

09:47.717 --> 09:48.675
No, don't.

09:48.718 --> 09:49.763
It's a necessary ritual.

09:49.806 --> 09:51.373
If they see
that it bothers me,

09:51.416 --> 09:53.157
it'll only encourage them
to do something worse.

09:53.201 --> 09:55.769
Don't worry, they'll do
something worse regardless.

09:55.812 --> 09:58.554
Climb in. We're going
to the same place.

10:03.820 --> 10:05.779
Are you serious?Very.

10:05.822 --> 10:08.216
Okay, you got to consult
the dad.

10:08.259 --> 10:10.435
I get this guy.Rookie, it's not
a barter system.

10:10.479 --> 10:12.176
No, it's a partnership--
and partners compromise,

10:12.220 --> 10:13.787
as my husband keeps telling me.

10:13.830 --> 10:16.311
Excuse me. Uh, do
you know this woman?

10:16.354 --> 10:18.922
No.

10:18.966 --> 10:20.968
If we find the stalker,
I'll bait him.

10:21.011 --> 10:22.578
See if he gets angry,
how it escalates.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.885
See if he has it in him to
cut out someone's heart.

10:24.928 --> 10:26.016
I know what "bait" means.

10:26.060 --> 10:27.931
Do you know this woman?

10:27.975 --> 10:29.150
MAN:
No, sorry.

10:38.028 --> 10:40.988
Same angle as the photos.Hi. I'm Detective Needham.

10:41.031 --> 10:43.643
I need to speak with you
about this woman.

10:45.862 --> 10:47.385
LIZZIE:
I got this.

10:47.429 --> 10:49.692
NYPD.

10:49.736 --> 10:52.390
: Okay, okay.
Just... just give me a sec.

10:52.434 --> 10:54.828
Not a good idea to
run from the police.

10:54.871 --> 10:57.221
My therapist says I have
impulse control issues.

10:57.265 --> 10:58.570
And you admit that
to the police?

10:58.614 --> 11:00.572
Nice flower stand.Is that where

11:00.616 --> 11:02.574
you got the roses
you sent Maggie?

11:02.618 --> 11:03.880
Yeah, but please don't tell
my boss.

11:03.924 --> 11:05.708
So you admit
you stalk her?

11:05.752 --> 11:06.709
Yeah.

11:06.753 --> 11:07.841
You're really not good at this.

11:07.884 --> 11:08.929
Did you know that
Maggie threw out

11:08.972 --> 11:10.060
the roses you gave her?

11:10.104 --> 11:11.453
And that she has
a new boyfriend?

11:11.496 --> 11:13.281
I guess it was just
a matter of time,

11:13.324 --> 11:14.499
her being so beautiful.

11:15.718 --> 11:16.893
Who's she?
Maybe you thought

11:16.937 --> 11:18.721
it was Maggie.No, no, no.

11:18.765 --> 11:19.940
That woman looks
nothing like Maggie.

11:19.983 --> 11:21.942
See...  Oh.

11:21.985 --> 11:23.944
Oh, oh.

11:23.987 --> 11:24.858
I must have cut myself.

11:24.901 --> 11:26.381
I might...

11:26.424 --> 11:27.861
I might vomit.

11:27.904 --> 11:30.385
You can go.
No.

11:30.428 --> 11:31.952
You can't.

11:33.214 --> 11:35.303
I'm confused.
Um, can I go?

11:35.346 --> 11:36.739
Or do I...

11:36.783 --> 11:38.480
I just forwarded myself
your contact info

11:38.523 --> 11:41.091
and deleted Maggie's information
and all your photos.

11:41.135 --> 11:43.485
The stalking ends now,
or I'll make sure

11:43.528 --> 11:45.617
you're never able to
hold a knife again,

11:45.661 --> 11:48.185
let alone cut flowers.

11:48.229 --> 11:49.709
Oh, you're giving me
your number.

11:49.752 --> 11:50.753
That's cool.It's the number

11:50.797 --> 11:51.841
of a police psychologist.

11:51.885 --> 11:53.800
If you don't call
him by tomorrow,

11:53.843 --> 11:54.931
I'll be back.

11:54.975 --> 11:56.977
Now you can go.

11:59.022 --> 12:00.850
Thanks for letting me
handle that.

12:00.894 --> 12:02.852
Handle? You were about
to just let him go.

12:02.896 --> 12:05.028
He was about to faint
over a drop of blood.

12:05.072 --> 12:07.422
There was no way he could have
cut out a human heart.

12:07.465 --> 12:09.163
I know. I just
like to make sure.

12:09.206 --> 12:10.251
Why?

12:10.294 --> 12:12.079
Because he...

12:12.122 --> 12:14.472
I'm your boss. I don't need
to explain myself to you.

12:14.516 --> 12:15.778
Fair enough.

12:15.822 --> 12:17.432
One question, boss--
do we get to eat?

12:17.475 --> 12:18.738
Sure. Right after we catch

12:18.781 --> 12:20.740
whoever cut out
that woman's heart.

12:20.783 --> 12:22.654
Actually, I'm starving.

12:24.265 --> 12:26.136
Lizzie, you want anything else?

12:26.180 --> 12:27.616
No, thank you, Andy.

12:27.659 --> 12:29.618
It was so good.

12:29.661 --> 12:30.750
I love your bar.

12:32.360 --> 12:34.405
Actually, if you could tell your
husband to pick up his pace

12:34.449 --> 12:37.713
before I stick this fork
in the back of my hand.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.236
It takes approximately
20 minutes

12:39.280 --> 12:40.629
from starting to eat
for the brain

12:40.672 --> 12:42.413
to send signals of fullness.

12:42.457 --> 12:44.589
We should chew each bite
until it liquefies

12:44.633 --> 12:47.941
or loses texture
before swallowing.

12:48.985 --> 12:50.421
Yes, he's like this at home.

12:50.465 --> 12:52.641
I'm so sorry.Telling you,
if you can

12:52.684 --> 12:56.384
handle Dylan, there is no killer
you can't catch.

13:00.867 --> 13:03.565
What, is the M.E. ready?I don't know.

13:03.608 --> 13:05.959
I just don't feel
like waiting anymore.

13:08.178 --> 13:09.571
Oh.

13:11.921 --> 13:13.531
Bye, I guess.

13:13.575 --> 13:14.968
Bye.

13:20.582 --> 13:21.888
Doug?

13:23.498 --> 13:24.673
Doug!

13:26.718 --> 13:29.678
I'm trying to overcome
negative minds.

13:29.721 --> 13:31.506
Can you come back?
Uh, no.

13:33.508 --> 13:35.684
The vic showed no signs
of strangulation,

13:35.727 --> 13:37.033
no defensive wounds,

13:37.077 --> 13:39.166
no signs of struggle.

13:39.209 --> 13:40.863
I found no injection marks,
which is consistent

13:40.907 --> 13:42.473
with the initial tox screen
that said

13:42.517 --> 13:43.735
there are no drugs
in the system.

13:43.779 --> 13:46.086
So, why was she killed?

13:46.129 --> 13:49.524
The motive for most murders is
either greed, love or pride.

13:49.567 --> 13:51.656
Do you really believe
the enormity of human behavior

13:51.700 --> 13:54.268
can fit into
three categories? Ha!

13:54.311 --> 13:56.313
Maybe you should
try meditation, too.

13:56.357 --> 13:57.662
It increases
the cortical thickness

13:57.706 --> 13:59.577
of the hippocampus,
which governs learning,

13:59.621 --> 14:02.102
and it decreases the brain cell
volume in the amygdala,

14:02.145 --> 14:05.409
which governs, uh, fear,
anxiety and stress,

14:05.453 --> 14:07.672
which can lead
to overly simplistic theories.

14:07.716 --> 14:09.065
Okay.

14:09.109 --> 14:11.241
Did you have any luck on
the fingerprint in AFIS?

14:11.285 --> 14:13.330
DOUG:
No.

14:14.592 --> 14:16.464
:
Distract him.

14:16.507 --> 14:18.466
What?

14:18.509 --> 14:19.684
Distract him.

14:19.728 --> 14:21.686
Why? No.
Do it.

14:27.475 --> 14:28.998
LIZZIE:
So, you meditate?

14:29.042 --> 14:31.174
DOUG: When I'm not
being interrupted.

14:31.218 --> 14:33.524
I, um... I thought
about meditating.

14:33.568 --> 14:35.962
I hear it's great for building
internal, um, energies.

14:36.005 --> 14:37.572
Uh, did you always want

14:37.615 --> 14:39.791
to be an M.E., Doug?
I'm curious about you.

14:39.835 --> 14:41.054
When did it
occur to you,

14:41.097 --> 14:43.708
"I want to cut
open dead people"?

14:43.752 --> 14:45.928
Was it, like, um,
an aha moment

14:45.972 --> 14:47.887
or a childhood dream?

14:50.063 --> 14:53.631
Well, you know, um,
it's a long...
Nice chatting.

14:53.675 --> 14:55.329
Bye, Doug.

14:55.372 --> 14:57.635
Childhood dream.

14:57.679 --> 14:59.637
Don't ever do
that to me again.

14:59.681 --> 15:01.291
Doug's not so bad.

15:01.335 --> 15:03.119
You don't need to steal
a dead woman's prints.

15:03.163 --> 15:04.338
You could've asked.

15:04.381 --> 15:05.992
Oh, that wouldn't be
nearly so much fun.

15:06.035 --> 15:07.167
Anyway, I didn't steal.

15:07.210 --> 15:08.516
I borrowed.
Oh...

15:08.559 --> 15:09.778
You stole.
Look, we have

15:09.821 --> 15:11.084
a dead woman
no one knows.

15:11.127 --> 15:12.433
No drugs, no struggle.

15:12.476 --> 15:14.087
Finding out who
she is may help us

15:14.130 --> 15:15.740
figure out who else
saw her that night.

15:15.784 --> 15:17.655
I need fingerprints
with no paper trail.

15:17.699 --> 15:20.615
Oh, you think
your super special secret friend

15:20.658 --> 15:22.399
will find a match.

15:22.443 --> 15:23.835
Is he CIA, too?

15:23.879 --> 15:25.402
My super special
secret friend

15:25.446 --> 15:28.188
can find out much
more than the NYPD.

15:30.842 --> 15:33.758
You playing tennis with
a really small racquet?

15:33.802 --> 15:36.326
Shocking how you forgot,
considering I thrashed you

15:36.370 --> 15:37.719
on the squash court
so many times.

15:37.762 --> 15:39.590
You wish. There's a
fingerprint on this.

15:39.634 --> 15:42.463
Belongs to a young woman
who had her heart cut out.

15:42.506 --> 15:44.595
I need your help to
find out who she was.

15:44.639 --> 15:45.596
A shot glass?

15:45.640 --> 15:47.468
Rushing a fraternity, are we?

15:47.511 --> 15:50.471
Her name's Amy Jenkins--
if that is indeed her name.

15:50.514 --> 15:51.776
She's not in the system--

15:51.820 --> 15:53.430
no birth certificate,
no school records.

15:53.474 --> 15:55.128
We can't even
alert her family.

15:55.171 --> 15:56.346
Okay, Detective.

15:56.390 --> 15:58.740
Or is it Consultant Detective?

15:58.783 --> 16:01.047
Do you get a badge?
Free doughnuts?

16:01.090 --> 16:03.353
Can I press the buttons
to make the lights on the car

16:03.397 --> 16:04.746
go round and round

16:04.789 --> 16:05.921
Clearly, you aren't.

16:07.836 --> 16:09.098
It's only
a matter of time

16:09.142 --> 16:11.318
before you're back
in the Acronym.

16:11.361 --> 16:13.755
We did have fun
back then, didn't we?

16:13.798 --> 16:15.844
Or you could come
work with me.
: Oh.

16:15.887 --> 16:18.325
The wayfaring,
enigmatic life

16:18.368 --> 16:20.109
of the independent
contractor.

16:20.153 --> 16:22.720
Unallied, self-reliant.

16:22.764 --> 16:24.809
It's really
quite liberating.

16:24.853 --> 16:27.856
I'm quite happy with
my life the way it is.

16:27.899 --> 16:30.772
As a former Agency analyst,
writer, teacher,

16:30.815 --> 16:31.903
and now cop consultant.

16:31.947 --> 16:33.688
Just as you dreamed
when you were a kid.

16:33.731 --> 16:36.560
I was never a kid.

16:37.909 --> 16:39.737
I'll use the print
to reconstruct

16:39.781 --> 16:41.522
the victim's
actual fingerprint,

16:41.565 --> 16:43.698
and hack into her cell phone
provider's biometric cloud

16:43.741 --> 16:45.395
of cryptographic
hash signatures.

16:45.439 --> 16:46.918
With a dactylogram match,

16:46.962 --> 16:48.703
I can data-dump
the contents of her phone

16:48.746 --> 16:50.835
onto any computer desktop.

16:50.879 --> 16:51.836
Totally.

17:14.207 --> 17:18.080
DYLAN:
Two blondes, same jacket.

17:18.124 --> 17:19.821
Almost identical.

17:19.864 --> 17:20.865
Did they kill the wrong one?

17:22.128 --> 17:24.304
Why the heart?

17:24.347 --> 17:25.914
Dad?

17:28.743 --> 17:30.310
Look at you.

17:30.353 --> 17:33.095
At the piano,
immersed in a police case.

17:33.139 --> 17:36.098
I remember when this room
was used for grading papers.

17:36.142 --> 17:37.708
Or writing.

17:37.752 --> 17:39.275
Speaking of which,
how is that book going?

17:39.319 --> 17:41.756
It's not going at all.

17:41.799 --> 17:43.801
You've been in here
for hours, playing music.

17:43.845 --> 17:46.630
You skipped dinner.
I know that look.

17:46.674 --> 17:48.719
You get consumed by these
things, you get obsessed,

17:48.763 --> 17:50.939
and then you can't
turn it off.
Andy.

17:52.288 --> 17:54.247
A poor woman had her
heart yanked out,

17:54.290 --> 17:56.945
and whoever did it
is still out there.

17:56.988 --> 17:58.816
Yes, it's irresistible

17:58.860 --> 18:01.819
and consuming, but that
doesn't mean I'm consumed.

18:03.386 --> 18:08.043
When I figure out the why,
I can understand the who.

18:08.087 --> 18:11.655
I'm sorry somebody died--
I am-- but I care about you.

18:11.699 --> 18:15.181
You may eat slow, but you make
big life decisions fast.

18:17.270 --> 18:18.793
Before I gave notice

18:18.836 --> 18:20.621
at my soul-crushing,
white-shoe law firm,

18:20.664 --> 18:22.840
we discussed it endlessly
together.

18:22.884 --> 18:24.929
You took this job on top
of the two you already have.

18:24.973 --> 18:26.975
You've barely said a word
about it,

18:27.018 --> 18:28.759
and I'm afraid
the less you talk about it,

18:28.803 --> 18:30.892
the harder it's gonna be
to turn it off.

18:33.242 --> 18:35.201
Okay, let's talk about it.

18:35.244 --> 18:36.854
Now? No, no, no, no, no.Yeah.

18:36.898 --> 18:38.943
Not when you're in the middle
of one of your

18:38.987 --> 18:41.772
crime-fighting, beautiful-mind,
meditative states.

18:41.816 --> 18:42.991
No, you're elsewhere.
We'll, uh...

18:43.034 --> 18:44.514
we'll talk tomorrow.

19:13.543 --> 19:16.372
Four graduate degrees
and a doctorate.

19:16.416 --> 19:18.461
How long have you
been standing there?

19:18.505 --> 19:19.593
Long enough.

19:19.636 --> 19:20.855
Shouldn't be
this complicated.

19:20.898 --> 19:22.335
It isn't.

19:22.378 --> 19:24.293
And it doesn't need to be.

19:24.337 --> 19:28.210
Oh, we're-we're not talking
about coffee anymore.

19:28.254 --> 19:30.212
I get that you're not a cop--
or even cop-ish--

19:30.256 --> 19:31.822
but there is a way
that we do things

19:31.866 --> 19:33.737
around here,
a way I like to do things,

19:33.781 --> 19:35.304
and you need to respect that.

19:35.348 --> 19:37.437
I do respect that.Mm-hmm.

19:37.480 --> 19:38.873
I don't have to agree with it.

19:38.916 --> 19:40.657
Okay, you can have
your authority issues

19:40.701 --> 19:42.790
and your mommy issues
and your social issues,

19:42.833 --> 19:44.574
but when it comes to the work,

19:44.618 --> 19:46.837
the only issue that matters
is the case.

19:46.881 --> 19:49.492
Yes, the case.

19:49.536 --> 19:51.015
Got it.

19:51.059 --> 19:53.540
I've been doing just fine
on my own.

19:53.583 --> 19:55.803
So have I.

19:55.846 --> 19:57.631
The coffee machine
would suggest otherwise.

19:57.674 --> 19:59.589
Oh.

20:05.465 --> 20:06.553
FUCCI:
Hey, Doc.

20:06.596 --> 20:08.555
How was the ride home
yesterday

20:08.598 --> 20:09.991
Good?

20:10.034 --> 20:11.122
So, what are we missing?

20:11.166 --> 20:12.559
Oh, just a motive,
a suspect,

20:12.602 --> 20:14.604
and the I.D.
of the victim.

20:14.648 --> 20:16.867
Other than that,
we're kicking ass.

20:16.911 --> 20:18.434
Maggie's dad checked out.

20:18.478 --> 20:19.783
His business
is legit.

20:19.827 --> 20:21.611
Mr. Pinky Ring?
Not seeing a motive.

20:21.655 --> 20:23.570
Though he does look
like a shark.

20:23.613 --> 20:25.615
When you said those whales
were devouring those sharks,

20:25.659 --> 20:28.314
you said something
like it's "surgically exact."

20:28.357 --> 20:30.316
"Almost surgical precision."Her rib cage is crushed,

20:30.359 --> 20:32.318
but look at the cuts
through the major vessels.

20:32.361 --> 20:34.537
The aorta, the vena cava--
they're precise.

20:34.581 --> 20:36.017
Surgically precise.

20:36.060 --> 20:37.845
The killer knew his way
with a knife.

20:37.888 --> 20:40.064
Like a butcher
or a doctor?

20:40.108 --> 20:41.675
But... what, he
was in a hurry?

20:41.718 --> 20:43.503
Or did he just care
about the heart?

20:43.546 --> 20:45.853
And if so, why? Why would
someone cut out a heart?

20:45.896 --> 20:47.289
:
You keep asking that.

20:49.509 --> 20:51.728
Excuse me.
Mm-hmm.

20:51.772 --> 20:53.948
JULIAN : I tracked
the victim's fingerprints.

20:53.991 --> 20:55.471
Your vic's real name

20:55.515 --> 20:58.431
is Beth Lennon,
from North Dakota.

20:58.474 --> 21:00.694
A small-town grifter
with 27 online identities,

21:00.737 --> 21:02.870
multiple Stay B and C
complaints,

21:02.913 --> 21:05.307
and tons of college debt.

21:06.613 --> 21:08.571
That's a text with a Web link,

21:08.615 --> 21:10.617
log-in I.D. and password
which you can use

21:10.660 --> 21:13.359
to access a portal
containing the contents

21:13.402 --> 21:14.969
of your victim's phone.

21:15.012 --> 21:16.927
You've got two hours
before the domain corrupts.

21:16.971 --> 21:18.625
And one more thing...

21:18.668 --> 21:20.583
Uh, just hold on a sec.

21:30.506 --> 21:32.639
Thanks for this. I owe you.

21:32.682 --> 21:34.945
I'm keeping a tab.
Before you go,

21:34.989 --> 21:36.382
I found some information

21:36.425 --> 21:38.079
on another matter
that might interest you.

21:38.122 --> 21:39.863
What is it?JULIAN: Not on the phone.

21:39.907 --> 21:42.518
You're not dragging me
into any spy games.

21:42.562 --> 21:45.304
Meet me at Soho House in 30.

21:51.658 --> 21:54.661
That "free parking permit"--
never gonna happen.

21:54.704 --> 21:56.315
I was just...

22:14.898 --> 22:16.813
How long before
you think he calls AAA?

22:25.039 --> 22:26.606
What does he think
he's doing?

22:31.437 --> 22:32.046
Wow.

22:35.049 --> 22:37.225
DYLAN: What couldn't you
tell me over the phone?

22:37.268 --> 22:40.097
I did some looking
into your new work situation

22:40.141 --> 22:42.622
with this particular
NYPD homicide squad.

22:42.665 --> 22:43.884
Of course you did.

22:43.927 --> 22:45.973
I found evidence...

22:46.016 --> 22:49.237
of an open CIA/FBI/MI6
task force

22:49.280 --> 22:51.326
that's been investigating
a smuggling operation

22:51.370 --> 22:52.806
that uses New York ports.

22:52.849 --> 22:56.375
They were zeroing in
on a Detective Charles Pavlik,

22:56.418 --> 22:57.767
when he was suddenly killed,

22:57.811 --> 23:00.596
ostensibly in
the line of duty.

23:00.640 --> 23:01.989
Charlie?

23:02.032 --> 23:03.904
You've heard of him?

23:03.947 --> 23:05.514
Uh-huh.

23:05.558 --> 23:07.647
I don't know
all the details yet,

23:07.690 --> 23:09.779
but I do know
the investigation is ongoing.

23:09.823 --> 23:12.216
Which leads me to believe
there are others on the team

23:12.260 --> 23:14.262
who may also be compromised.

23:14.305 --> 23:16.307
Maybe Charlie's
previous partner.

23:16.351 --> 23:20.311
And his fiancÃ©e, who you know
is Detective Elizabeth Needham,

23:20.355 --> 23:23.532
my current partner.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.057
Who is certainly not dirty.

23:27.101 --> 23:29.277
Why would you even try to
raise doubts about her?

23:31.932 --> 23:33.716
I gotta go.

23:34.761 --> 23:36.458
Do you want me
to keep digging?

23:36.502 --> 23:38.025
No. Even if Charlie

23:38.068 --> 23:39.461
were corrupt,
Lizzie didn't know.

23:39.505 --> 23:41.115
You're worried
about protecting her.

23:41.158 --> 23:42.943
Protect yourself.I have a pretty
good record

23:42.986 --> 23:44.684
about judging human behavior.

23:44.727 --> 23:46.512
I may not know Lizzie well,

23:46.555 --> 23:48.731
but trust can be instinctive,
and I trust her.

23:50.211 --> 23:51.778
She is not dirty.

23:56.217 --> 24:00.047
Whoa. Our guys really
pulled this together fast.

24:00.090 --> 24:02.702
Look at all of our victim's
dating app traffic.

24:02.745 --> 24:04.051
Popular girl.

24:04.094 --> 24:06.183
Should we do this?

24:06.227 --> 24:07.924
If we must.

24:07.968 --> 24:09.665
Lock the door.

24:12.320 --> 24:14.278
How's the new consultant?

24:14.322 --> 24:16.759
Given the fact that every cop
I've partnered with

24:16.803 --> 24:18.761
since Charlie
has driven me crazy,

24:18.805 --> 24:20.197
I thought Dylan
would be different

24:20.241 --> 24:21.503
since he's not a cop.

24:21.547 --> 24:22.722
Thigh or abdomen?

24:22.765 --> 24:24.288
Abdomen.

24:24.332 --> 24:26.552
Well, just say the word,
and I will tell the mayor

24:26.595 --> 24:28.423
that Dylan's
not working out.

24:28.467 --> 24:31.165
No, it's... he's fine.
Maybe it's me.

24:31.208 --> 24:32.514
It's really a pretty
small needle.

24:32.558 --> 24:34.298
Don't even say that word.

24:36.126 --> 24:39.042
I think you and David
being proactive is smart.

24:39.086 --> 24:41.741
Fertility issues will do that.

24:41.784 --> 24:43.612
You can open the door.

24:44.831 --> 24:45.788
Okay, our victim's

24:45.832 --> 24:47.660
most recent date was set

24:47.703 --> 24:51.751
with a "Richard P"
on the night she was murdered.

24:51.794 --> 24:53.492
Yeah, I wish it
were that simple.

24:53.535 --> 24:55.406
She had half a dozen dating
apps, and made six dates

24:55.450 --> 24:57.191
with six different guys
on the same night.

24:57.234 --> 25:00.890
Well, then you better get busy
writing six warrant requests.

25:00.934 --> 25:03.110
That could take all night.
We need to narrow it down.

25:03.153 --> 25:05.416
Like, butchers, doctors,
anyone with knife skills.

25:08.594 --> 25:11.727
"Dr. Damian. Adventurous,

25:11.771 --> 25:14.643
"successful,
loves healing people.

25:14.687 --> 25:17.167
"Looking for
a spontaneous woman,

25:17.211 --> 25:19.822
ideally blonde."

25:19.866 --> 25:22.346
Harris. Get me a warrant
for Date N' Chill

25:22.390 --> 25:24.131
so I can find the identity
of this doctor.

25:24.174 --> 25:25.306
Copy.

25:25.349 --> 25:27.917
I don't want to
wait that long.

25:27.961 --> 25:30.790
You have a better idea?Yeah.

25:30.833 --> 25:33.140
I'm gonna do the same thing
our victim did:

25:33.183 --> 25:36.839
make a date with a stranger
who could rip out my heart.

25:43.454 --> 25:45.500
ANDY:
Could you please not touch that?

25:45.544 --> 25:47.241
What a happy coincidence
you made Lizzie come

25:47.284 --> 25:49.069
to my place 'cause,
you know, New Yorkmagazine

25:49.112 --> 25:51.288
just voted it "Best Bar
for Luring Crazed Murderers."

25:51.332 --> 25:53.116
Uh, possible
crazed murderers.

25:53.160 --> 25:54.378
You know,
I ought to call the police.

25:54.422 --> 25:56.685
I am the police.

25:56.729 --> 25:59.122
ANDY: Hey, would you...
could you just put that down?

25:59.166 --> 26:00.123
DYLAN:
But it's fun.

26:00.167 --> 26:01.472
Why don't you just
arrest the guy?

26:01.516 --> 26:02.648
Well, Lizzie's trying
to draw him out,

26:02.691 --> 26:04.345
try to get him to
admit to things

26:04.388 --> 26:06.390
he may not if he
knew she were a cop.

26:06.434 --> 26:09.219
And I'm here...
making sure she's safe.

26:13.136 --> 26:14.964
I think our doc is a no-show.

26:15.008 --> 26:16.139
Maybe he got suspicious.

26:16.183 --> 26:17.140
Mmm.

26:17.184 --> 26:18.359
Oh.

26:19.403 --> 26:20.840
Scratch that.

26:22.668 --> 26:24.408
Hey.
Hey.

26:24.452 --> 26:25.714
Sorry I'm late.

26:25.758 --> 26:27.586
I would've been
on time if you hadn't

26:27.629 --> 26:29.109
switched locations on me
at the last minute.

26:29.152 --> 26:30.545
:
Well, you're here now,

26:30.589 --> 26:32.591
so get comfortable and
take a deep breath.

26:34.941 --> 26:36.812
Wow, you're prettier
than your pictures.

26:36.856 --> 26:39.119
That's rare.LIZZIE: Yes, I know.

26:39.162 --> 26:40.947
I mean, not that I'm prettier,
but, you know,

26:40.990 --> 26:42.557
how people lie and exaggerate.

26:42.601 --> 26:44.603
Really, what's the point?Exactly.

26:44.646 --> 26:47.431
Can I get a gin and tonic?

26:47.475 --> 26:48.694
Uh, top shelf.

26:48.737 --> 26:50.957
You got gorgeous eyes.

26:51.000 --> 26:53.481
Are you really Serbian,
trying to get your work visa?

26:59.226 --> 27:01.228
What did you say?
I said,

27:01.271 --> 27:02.490
"Of course, I'm Serbian."

27:02.533 --> 27:03.622
And then, um...

27:03.665 --> 27:05.362
I asked if you're
really a doctor.

27:05.406 --> 27:06.712
I am.

27:06.755 --> 27:08.235
What is your specialty?

27:08.278 --> 27:10.106
Dermatologist?

27:10.150 --> 27:11.542
Um, pediatrician?

27:11.586 --> 27:12.805
Surgeon?

27:12.848 --> 27:14.589
Why, are surgeons
your specialty?

27:16.112 --> 27:18.941
I became a doctor
to heal those in pain.

27:18.985 --> 27:21.335
And I can tell,
just from your energy,

27:21.378 --> 27:23.511
you're in a lot
of pain yourself.

27:23.554 --> 27:25.513
You're not a doctor.

27:25.556 --> 27:26.862
I happen to be
the most in-demand

27:26.906 --> 27:29.517
kinesiologist
in all of Manhattan.

27:29.560 --> 27:31.040
Like I said, not a doctor.

27:31.084 --> 27:32.346
Just 'cause I didn't go
to medical school

27:32.389 --> 27:33.390
doesn't mean I'm not a doctor.

27:33.434 --> 27:35.479
That is exactly what it means.

27:36.959 --> 27:38.482
What, that's it?

27:38.526 --> 27:39.962
You're done talking to me?

27:40.006 --> 27:43.139
:
I haven't even started.

27:43.183 --> 27:45.359
Is that her?
Yeah.

27:45.402 --> 27:46.447
We ate,

27:46.490 --> 27:48.101
but I swear I didn't kill her.

27:48.144 --> 27:49.711
I-I didn't even say
good night to her.

27:49.755 --> 27:51.278
Why is that?

27:51.321 --> 27:53.280
She split
before the check even came.

27:53.323 --> 27:55.761
I... She was only pretending
to be interested in me

27:55.804 --> 27:57.371
to get a free meal. I...

27:57.414 --> 27:59.416
And once I figured out
what she was up to,

27:59.460 --> 28:01.592
I chased her, but I decided,
what's the point?

28:01.636 --> 28:04.291
Thought that was
the worst date of my entire life

28:04.334 --> 28:05.858
until tonight.You chased her?

28:05.901 --> 28:07.860
Did you talk to her?No, I was like...

28:07.903 --> 28:10.645
a block away.
I let her go. Uh...

28:10.689 --> 28:12.734
What was I gonna say

28:12.778 --> 28:14.605
It was on Hudson Street.

28:14.649 --> 28:16.259
Going which direction?
South.

28:16.303 --> 28:18.479
Uh, but then she turned.
Onto?

28:18.522 --> 28:20.481
It was a right onto Morton.

28:21.830 --> 28:23.658
I'll have the unis
cast a wide net,

28:23.702 --> 28:25.616
see to it that all
the CCTV footage

28:25.660 --> 28:27.401
along the route Beth took
is collected.

28:27.444 --> 28:28.794
How long will that take?

28:28.837 --> 28:31.448
Hopefully, we'll have
it all by the morning.

28:46.550 --> 28:49.031
So, I went to your house,
no one answered,

28:49.075 --> 28:50.641
it's almost midnight,
and I thought,

28:50.685 --> 28:52.426
"Where would Lizzie be?"

28:52.469 --> 28:53.732
Et voilÃ .

28:53.775 --> 28:56.038
You should be a detective.

28:56.082 --> 28:57.561
I'm trying.

28:57.605 --> 28:59.346
If you'd let me.

29:00.521 --> 29:04.438
I've been told I can be...

29:04.481 --> 29:09.573
challenging, but I know
you like a challenge.

29:10.836 --> 29:12.620
That's something
we have in common.

29:14.143 --> 29:15.971
That's one thing
we do have in common.

29:16.015 --> 29:18.191
I've been told
I can be challenging, too.

29:18.234 --> 29:20.236
Oh, is that why you isolate
yourself from the team?

29:20.280 --> 29:22.456
I don't isolate myself.

29:22.499 --> 29:23.979
Okay, okay.

29:24.023 --> 29:25.633
Maybe I do.

29:25.676 --> 29:28.810
That's why no one wants
to partner with me.

29:28.854 --> 29:30.769
I don't blame them.

29:30.812 --> 29:32.422
Ever since Charlie...

29:32.466 --> 29:33.597
They care about you.

29:34.947 --> 29:36.992
Your detective skills
are failing you.

29:38.602 --> 29:41.170
Give me time.

29:41.214 --> 29:43.477
I'll get there.

29:44.521 --> 29:46.262
I know you will.

29:46.306 --> 29:47.742
So will I.

29:53.792 --> 29:56.272
Detective Needham...

29:58.013 --> 30:00.494
...will you...

30:00.537 --> 30:02.888
show me how to use
the coffee machine?

30:11.679 --> 30:14.029
Oh, yes, that's why I came
all the way over here--

30:14.073 --> 30:16.684
to have a conversation
with your feet.

30:16.727 --> 30:18.207
Morning, Joan. Let yourself in.

30:20.470 --> 30:23.430
Listen, everybody
is crazy for the new book.

30:23.473 --> 30:25.432
Now you just
have to write it.

30:25.475 --> 30:27.042
And don't pretend
like you don't have time

30:27.086 --> 30:28.696
'cause you work for the NYPD.

30:28.739 --> 30:30.263
That's not gonna fly.Sure.

30:30.306 --> 30:32.091
Having less time's gonna
make it easier to write.

30:32.134 --> 30:33.701
Oh, you know what?
I should tell you--

30:33.744 --> 30:36.617
Johnson and Kimball also want
to make a audiobook

30:36.660 --> 30:38.053
of Freaks.

30:38.097 --> 30:39.620
Now, they gave me
a whole list of,

30:39.663 --> 30:40.708
you know, famous people,

30:40.751 --> 30:42.884
but I like
Dame Judi Dench

30:42.928 --> 30:44.451
and Ice-T.

30:44.494 --> 30:47.628
I have no interest
in recording an audiobook.

30:47.671 --> 30:50.109
I'm already wearing
too many hats.

30:50.152 --> 30:53.634
That's why I asked them to
give you a six-month extension.

30:53.677 --> 30:54.853
They agreed to that?

30:54.896 --> 30:56.550
That's how much they love
the new premise.

30:56.593 --> 30:59.422
What new premise?Hot ex-CIA agent

30:59.466 --> 31:01.816
gets in with the NYPD

31:01.860 --> 31:03.209
to solve crime.

31:03.252 --> 31:04.863
:
It's gonna be much better

31:04.906 --> 31:06.690
than the boring old book
you're not writing.

31:06.734 --> 31:09.737
I don't want to revisit
my CIA past.

31:09.780 --> 31:11.782
That's why I retired.

31:13.610 --> 31:14.916
Get on the couch.

31:15.961 --> 31:18.006
Get on the couch.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.928
What's going on?

31:26.972 --> 31:29.409
Nothing.

31:29.452 --> 31:31.977
Everything.

31:32.020 --> 31:34.109
Just feel I'm being pulled in
so many different directions.

31:34.153 --> 31:36.851
You know, like
teaching...

31:36.895 --> 31:39.810
writing,
chasing killers.

31:39.854 --> 31:41.595
Everything okay with Andy?

31:41.638 --> 31:42.726
Oh, quite the reverse.

31:42.770 --> 31:44.337
He couldn't be more supportive.

31:44.380 --> 31:46.469
Right, well,
that's good.Mm-hmm.

31:46.513 --> 31:47.775
Well, how about
this... this case--

31:47.818 --> 31:49.385
the one with
the missing heart?

31:51.300 --> 31:54.651
Imagine the type of person
who would have the idea

31:54.695 --> 31:57.785
to cut out
another person's heart

31:57.828 --> 32:00.266
and prepare for it...

32:00.309 --> 32:02.181
and follow through with it.

32:02.224 --> 32:03.834
Oh, my.

32:03.878 --> 32:05.793
You're enjoying this.

32:05.836 --> 32:07.664
Relishing every second.

32:07.708 --> 32:08.970
Oh, my goodness.

32:09.014 --> 32:10.841
Welcome back.

32:10.885 --> 32:12.756
The old Dylan has returned.

32:12.800 --> 32:15.324
Yeah, but he's scaring me.

32:15.368 --> 32:17.805
What if I can't stop

32:23.593 --> 32:24.986
Gotta go.

32:28.337 --> 32:29.860
DYLAN:
Doesn't look like a boyfriend.

32:29.904 --> 32:32.167
Watch.
See him squeeze her head?

32:32.211 --> 32:33.908
A pressure point?

32:33.952 --> 32:35.040
Look at her hand.
It's shaking.

32:35.083 --> 32:37.172
And the-the jerking
of her arms.

32:37.216 --> 32:39.087
And then her body
goes limp.

32:39.131 --> 32:40.523
What could cause that to happen?

32:40.567 --> 32:42.003
A seizure followed by paralysis?

32:42.047 --> 32:45.702
Well, he must have injected her
with a neurotoxin, wh...

32:45.746 --> 32:47.748
It wasn't a pressure point.

32:47.791 --> 32:49.793
He stuck a needle
in her hair.

32:49.837 --> 32:51.882
Which is why the M.E. didn't
see the injection mark.

32:51.926 --> 32:54.015
I'm calling him, have him run
an advanced tox screen.

32:54.059 --> 32:55.930
Maybe it wasn't a
mistaken identity.

32:55.974 --> 32:57.018
Beth was a grifter.

32:57.062 --> 32:59.542
Maybe it was meant to be her.

32:59.586 --> 33:01.805
It's hard to tell from that
video if he knew her or not.

33:01.849 --> 33:03.807
If he didn't,
we can rule out pride.

33:03.851 --> 33:05.331
Which leaves greed and...

33:05.374 --> 33:07.072
Oh, come on.
If you keep stating

33:07.115 --> 33:08.769
that "three motive" theory,

33:08.812 --> 33:10.423
we can rule out
intelligence, too.

33:11.467 --> 33:12.903
What are we missing?

33:12.947 --> 33:13.817
Take a seat right there.

33:13.861 --> 33:14.993
Hey, guys.

33:16.081 --> 33:17.256
Ooh.

33:17.299 --> 33:18.909
Pete, what happened?

33:18.953 --> 33:22.783
This colossal guy just
shows up to my flower stand,

33:22.826 --> 33:25.829
and he just starts
punching and punching.

33:25.873 --> 33:27.831
He said that if
I ever even look

33:27.875 --> 33:29.790
at Maggie again, it'll be
the last thing I ever do.

33:29.833 --> 33:31.052
DYLAN:
Never thought
I'd feel bad

33:31.096 --> 33:32.097
for a stalker.

33:32.140 --> 33:33.968
Was the guy who hit you 50s,

33:34.012 --> 33:35.056
thin, wearing a pinky ring?

33:35.100 --> 33:37.406
No, no, he was young
and ripped and...

33:37.450 --> 33:39.104
wearing my face on his fist.

33:39.147 --> 33:41.062
Do you want to go to the E.R.?

33:41.106 --> 33:42.846
With you?

33:42.890 --> 33:45.762
Uh, Anthony, can you please get
Pete's story and a description?

33:45.806 --> 33:47.938
Sure.Detective Fucci will help you.

33:51.464 --> 33:52.943
Frank might have had
someone follow us,

33:52.987 --> 33:54.902
and we led him to Pete.

33:54.945 --> 33:58.036
Yeah, when your own child's
in danger, you'd do anything.

34:02.953 --> 34:03.911
She's my only child.

34:03.954 --> 34:04.912
Why didn't you tell me?

34:04.955 --> 34:06.044
I would have handled it.

34:06.087 --> 34:07.219
Thanks to my father.

34:07.262 --> 34:08.524
He'd do anything for me.

34:08.568 --> 34:10.396
That's why I didn't tell you.

34:10.439 --> 34:13.007
DYLAN:
There's nothing stronger.

34:13.051 --> 34:14.922
Your "three motive" theory.

34:14.965 --> 34:17.055
I know what we're missing.

34:17.881 --> 34:19.013
Love.

34:20.101 --> 34:22.016
The love of a parent.

34:28.588 --> 34:30.764
JASMINE:
Okay, so why the dad?Love.

34:30.807 --> 34:32.983
Love?The love of a parent
for their child

34:33.027 --> 34:34.463
is the most powerful
love there is.

34:34.507 --> 34:36.552
And the best way to get back
at a guy like Frank,

34:36.596 --> 34:38.554
who's devoted to his daughter,
is to go after her.

34:38.598 --> 34:40.382
DYLAN:
Somebody wanted Maggie dead,
and you don't get to be

34:40.426 --> 34:43.298
as successful as Frank is
without making a few enemies.

34:43.342 --> 34:45.039
So, revenge?

34:45.083 --> 34:47.128
That's it?

34:47.172 --> 34:49.043
Okay.

34:49.087 --> 34:51.350
I was reviewing the bank
records of Denizen Solutions,

34:51.393 --> 34:53.047
Frank's company, which
is supposed to sell

34:53.091 --> 34:55.049
medical supplies to hospitals,
but a lot of these checks

34:55.093 --> 34:56.485
are made out to
"Denizen Cares."

34:56.529 --> 34:58.139
Sounds like a charity.

34:58.183 --> 34:59.923
Yeah, or a front.

34:59.967 --> 35:01.577
And look at this.

35:01.621 --> 35:05.233
All the payments are made
using personal checks.

35:05.277 --> 35:06.408
And they're not
small amounts, either.

35:06.452 --> 35:11.152
$225,000, $350,000...
$400,000?

35:11.196 --> 35:16.201
Could our medical supplies maven
be a money launderer, too?

35:16.244 --> 35:17.680
If he is, he's not
very adept at hiding it.

35:17.724 --> 35:19.334
Or maybe he's a bookie.

35:19.378 --> 35:21.031
FUCCI: Yeah, but then the
checks would be clustered

35:21.075 --> 35:23.164
around the same dates when
there are games or fights.

35:23.208 --> 35:24.644
These checks are
spread over time.

35:26.167 --> 35:28.213
What? I had a
gambling phase.

35:28.256 --> 35:30.171
:
Thank you, guys. Thanks.

35:30.215 --> 35:31.912
None of these names
look familiar.

35:31.955 --> 35:34.567
Well, just try
any of them.

35:34.610 --> 35:36.177
Charles Shore.

35:36.221 --> 35:38.440
Fund-raiser was held
for Charles Shore

35:38.484 --> 35:40.181
because he needed a kidney.

35:40.225 --> 35:42.531
Alison Dorfman.

35:42.575 --> 35:45.055
She got a cornea transplant.

35:45.099 --> 35:47.493
Wait, here's a check

35:47.536 --> 35:48.711
from Haru Onishi.

35:48.755 --> 35:49.930
Isn't he the chef--
Onishi Sushi,

35:49.973 --> 35:52.106
where Frank eats?Mm-hmm.

35:52.150 --> 35:54.108
Why would a sushi chef
pay $250,000

35:54.152 --> 35:55.544
to a medical supplies company?

35:55.588 --> 35:57.633
Try the transplant registry.

36:00.767 --> 36:01.942
Yup.

36:01.985 --> 36:03.335
Riku Onishi.

36:03.378 --> 36:05.859
She's got to be related
to Haru Onishi.

36:05.902 --> 36:07.382
So, all the names of the people

36:07.426 --> 36:08.688
who made payments
to Denizen Cares

36:08.731 --> 36:11.038
are also on the transplant list.

36:12.561 --> 36:14.650
Frank is a black market
organ broker,

36:14.694 --> 36:16.783
and Onishi bought a
heart for his daughter.

36:18.306 --> 36:20.221
LIZZIE: Onishi's daughter
died a month ago

36:20.265 --> 36:21.440
of congestive heart disease.

36:21.483 --> 36:22.615
She never got the transplant.

36:22.658 --> 36:25.400
But Onishi paid
Frank 250 grand.

36:25.444 --> 36:27.359
And Frank returned that 250
on the same day

36:27.402 --> 36:29.535
he got 350 from a Derek Wilson.

36:29.578 --> 36:31.754
Frank sold the heart
to the highest bidder.

36:31.798 --> 36:33.887
And Onishi's daughter died
waiting for one.

36:33.930 --> 36:35.497
Sushi knives are built
for precise cuts.

36:35.541 --> 36:37.195
Onishi wanted revenge.

36:37.238 --> 36:39.240
And to get back at Frank,
Onishi went after his daughter.

36:39.284 --> 36:40.850
But he got Beth by mistake.
The cross-race effect.

36:40.894 --> 36:42.025
But why would Frank
go back there

36:42.069 --> 36:43.679
after what he did to Onishi?

36:43.723 --> 36:46.769
Frank saw Onishi as
commerce, not a person.

36:46.813 --> 36:48.380
He got a better offer,

36:48.423 --> 36:50.208
gave Onishi back his
money. That was that.

36:50.251 --> 36:52.862
Why should business stop him
eating in his favorite place?

36:52.906 --> 36:55.604
It's Friday, almost lunchtime.

36:55.648 --> 36:58.216
If Maggie joins her dad
and Onishi sees

36:58.259 --> 36:59.913
he didn't kill her...He may try now.

36:59.956 --> 37:02.045
Come on.

37:02.089 --> 37:04.657
Hey! Is your daughter here?

37:04.700 --> 37:07.137
She's in the bathroom. Why?Stay right there.

37:07.181 --> 37:09.009
Hey! Hey!

37:09.052 --> 37:11.316
Where's your boss

37:13.056 --> 37:15.537
Detective Needham?Go back in and lock the door.

37:23.023 --> 37:24.764
Who are you?

37:24.807 --> 37:26.635
My name is Dylan Reinhart.

37:26.679 --> 37:28.158
I'm with the NYPD.

37:29.812 --> 37:32.250
I'm not going to run.

37:37.472 --> 37:40.997
I gave up everything
to save my daughter.

37:41.041 --> 37:43.391
I failed her.

37:44.436 --> 37:45.567
He's confessing.

37:45.611 --> 37:46.612
He can do so
while under arrest.

37:46.655 --> 37:48.614
It's a deathbed confession.

37:49.963 --> 37:52.400
LIZZIE:
Is that blowfish
you ingested?

37:54.968 --> 37:57.231
That's what you injected
into the girl, isn't it?

37:57.275 --> 37:58.450
Yes.

37:59.581 --> 38:01.801
I didn't know
it wasn't his daughter.

38:01.844 --> 38:04.456
I never would
have done it.

38:04.499 --> 38:06.632
I can't tell you what it means

38:06.675 --> 38:09.983
to lose the person
you love most in the world.

38:10.026 --> 38:12.855
I'm calling an ambulance.

38:12.899 --> 38:14.770
There's no point.I'm calling just in case.

38:21.864 --> 38:26.042
Frank Fallon gave hope
to my daughter.

38:26.086 --> 38:27.783
To me.

38:28.915 --> 38:31.526
Riku should be alive right now.

38:31.570 --> 38:34.790
Every day,
he comes in, smiling,

38:34.834 --> 38:37.793
joking, eats my food

38:37.837 --> 38:39.099
like nothing's happened.

38:39.142 --> 38:40.753
I wanted him to be

38:40.796 --> 38:44.234
in pain
the way I've been in pain.

38:45.801 --> 38:49.718
But when his daughter
came in today...

38:49.762 --> 38:51.720
You knew you'd killed
the wrong girl.

38:52.982 --> 38:56.725
After Riku died, that father...

38:56.769 --> 39:00.338
his face haunted me in my mind.

39:03.558 --> 39:05.343
What have I done?

39:15.440 --> 39:16.658
I'm slammed.

39:17.746 --> 39:18.747
Okay, I'll make this quick.

39:18.791 --> 39:20.575
I didn't tell you
what I was doing

39:20.619 --> 39:22.795
because the excitement I felt
chasing killers,

39:22.838 --> 39:24.492
it-it... it scared me.

39:24.536 --> 39:26.059
I do need

39:26.102 --> 39:28.322
to do this kind of work,

39:28.366 --> 39:30.933
but I'm going to need
your help to turn it off.

39:32.282 --> 39:34.241
I can't do it without you.

39:34.284 --> 39:35.416
Uh, but you know what?

39:35.460 --> 39:36.983
I'm gonna need your help, Dylan,

39:37.026 --> 39:38.680
trusting that sometimes
I may know

39:38.724 --> 39:39.899
more about behavior than you.

39:39.942 --> 39:41.857
At least your
behavior.

39:41.901 --> 39:43.816
'Cause, you know,
smart as you are, sometimes...

39:43.859 --> 39:45.818
you can be really dumb.

39:45.861 --> 39:47.123
Fine.

39:47.167 --> 39:48.908
I think "dumb" is a bit much.

39:49.822 --> 39:51.214
Thanks.

39:51.258 --> 39:53.216
Okay, I see
you're busy.

39:53.260 --> 39:54.435
Just go do what makes you happy.

39:54.479 --> 39:55.784
Go make New York safe.

39:55.828 --> 39:57.090
And, um...

39:57.133 --> 39:58.134
thank you.

39:59.658 --> 40:02.443
Oh, uh... almost forgot.

40:02.487 --> 40:04.402
Saw this on the
way in today.

40:14.716 --> 40:16.326
Mm

40:16.370 --> 40:20.548
I will try not to make fun of
your overly simplistic ideas.

40:20.592 --> 40:22.158
And I'll try not to keep

40:22.202 --> 40:23.725
reminding you
that I'm your boss.

40:23.769 --> 40:24.726
Even though I am.

40:24.770 --> 40:26.249
And for the record,

40:26.293 --> 40:28.730
Onishi was willing
to buy a black market heart.

40:28.774 --> 40:30.079
Greed.

40:30.123 --> 40:31.733
He went after Maggie
to avenge Frank.

40:31.777 --> 40:33.474
Pride.

40:33.518 --> 40:35.737
And he did it all
because he loved his daughter.

40:35.781 --> 40:37.739
Greed, pride and love.

40:37.783 --> 40:39.567
The trifecta.

40:44.311 --> 40:45.921
Ah, another collar.

40:45.965 --> 40:47.488
FUCCI:
You're making us
look bad.

40:47.532 --> 40:49.490
Ah, you don't need
our help with that.

40:49.534 --> 40:51.710
Well, we're gonna go to Dis Con.
Want to come, celebrate?

40:51.753 --> 40:53.276
SOSA:
Come on, Lizzie.
It'll be fun.

40:53.320 --> 40:54.756
Dis Con?

40:54.800 --> 40:56.062
Short for Disorderly Conduct.

40:56.105 --> 40:57.803
A cop bar. I'll pass.

40:57.846 --> 40:59.500
Big surprise.

40:59.544 --> 41:01.937
Let's go.

41:01.981 --> 41:03.286
You know, I'm starting
to think the hazing

41:03.330 --> 41:04.766
was less about
giving me a hard time

41:04.810 --> 41:07.377
and more about trying
to cheer you up.

41:07.421 --> 41:09.379
Maybe they want to see you
like you used to be.

41:09.423 --> 41:11.207
I've always been like this.

41:11.251 --> 41:13.253
I know you well enough
to know that's not true.

41:13.296 --> 41:15.298
You should go out
for a drink with the guys.

41:15.342 --> 41:16.604
I'll go with you.

41:16.648 --> 41:17.823
Maybe another time.

41:17.866 --> 41:19.868
Right now, I just
need to stay here.

41:19.912 --> 41:21.217
Here?

41:21.261 --> 41:22.523
On the sidewalk?

41:22.567 --> 41:24.220
Yeah.
Why?

41:25.700 --> 41:28.964
Three, two, one.

41:29.008 --> 41:31.140
What the hell did you
do to my Harley?

41:37.843 --> 41:40.498
DYLAN:
Lizzie.

41:42.456 --> 41:44.414
You can take my bike
if you like.

41:44.458 --> 41:45.807
LIZZIE:
Yeah...

41:45.851 --> 41:48.070
we'll walk
to the bar.
