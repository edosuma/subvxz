"Once in every nighttime,
someone comes around. "

00:43.400 --> 00:47.400
- "I'm coming to get you.”
-No.

00:47.600 --> 00:52.200
"There's someone
that makes sleeping difficult. "

00:53.600 --> 00:55.700
"Cassie.”

00:57.000 --> 00:59.900
"I'm coming."

01:00.300 --> 01:01.700
Who's there?

01:03.100 --> 01:06.800
-"The Tickle Monster."
-No.

01:06.800 --> 01:12.200
"That's right, Sylvester Stallone
is the Tickle Monster."

01:12.200 --> 01:14.500
"I'm gonna tickle you."

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
"What?"
"I'm gonna tickle you."

01:18.000 --> 01:19.900
"What?"
"I'm gonna tickle you!"

01:21.400 --> 01:23.000
Daddy, help.

01:23.800 --> 01:28.300
I'm here, Cassie.
Unhand my daughter, Tickle Monster.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.900
Oh, hand-to-hand.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.200
-Look, over there.
-Go, Daddy, go.

01:34.200 --> 01:36.100
"Oh, dear."

01:36.100 --> 01:38.200
-Is she still up?
-Yeah.

01:38.200 --> 01:40.000
Yeah, I just gave her a warm bath...

01:40.000 --> 01:42.100
...and now she's more wide-awake
than I am.

01:42.100 --> 01:45.700
She won't be so sharp
for her big meeting tomorrow.

01:45.700 --> 01:48.200
-Good night, sweetie.
-Night, Mommy.

01:49.300 --> 01:52.300
Well, if I can get Carl to sleep
in the next 10 minutes...

01:52.300 --> 01:55.600
-...you might still have a shot tonight.
-Use a mallet if you have to.

01:55.600 --> 01:58.300
-Daddy?
-Yeah, baby?

01:58.900 --> 02:01.200
I'm never gonna get married.

02:01.200 --> 02:04.100
Why not? It's not as bad as it looks.

02:04.100 --> 02:06.900
Because I always want to live here
with you.

02:07.800 --> 02:11.400
Well, you know, one day,
you're gonna grow up...

02:11.400 --> 02:14.000
...meet a wonderful guy,
and you're gonna get married.

02:15.100 --> 02:17.900
But you and I
will always be best friends.

02:22.600 --> 02:24.500
Good night, Cassie.

02:27.400 --> 02:29.500
Dad, could you be any more of a dork?

02:29.500 --> 02:32.600
Cassie, you know where this girl lives
or you just think you know?

02:32.600 --> 02:35.000
I know where she lives,
I just know one way to get there.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.800
-And you refuse to go that way.
-Because it's a stupid way.

02:37.800 --> 02:41.400
-If you consider getting there stupid.
-Why don't you use the navigation?

02:41.400 --> 02:45.000
Because Sacajawea back there
doesn't know the name of the street.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.900
She knows it as "the one
next to the one with the fountain."

02:47.900 --> 02:49.900
Hey, Dad,
Cassie just gave you the finger.

02:49.900 --> 02:52.000
If we don't find this house
in two minutes--

02:52.000 --> 02:53.500
-There it is.
-Okay, honey...

02:53.500 --> 02:55.100
...hurry up, go get your friend.

02:55.100 --> 02:57.300
-Jerk.
-I heard that.

02:57.300 --> 02:58.600
Good.

03:01.200 --> 03:03.800
-Where are they?
-She just left.

03:03.800 --> 03:05.100
Okay.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.100
Which friend is this, the nice one?

03:08.100 --> 03:09.900
You used to know all her friends.

03:09.900 --> 03:12.300
-You were funny and charming.
-Well, she's 15.

03:12.300 --> 03:15.100
She doesn't want me to be charming.
She finds it creepy.

03:15.100 --> 03:16.500
Oh, no.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.500
It's the too-nice one.

03:18.500 --> 03:20.200
Hi, thanks for inviting me.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.200
Any friend of Cassie's
is always welcome.

03:22.200 --> 03:23.800
We're a little late.

03:26.900 --> 03:29.500
Remember, congratulate Todd
on the Alpine soda merger...

03:29.500 --> 03:32.100
...tell him the house looks great,
work in his outfit.

03:32.100 --> 03:34.000
-Maybe he smells nice.
-Lick his face?

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
No, don't touch him.
Don't shake his hand.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.700
-Oh, right, Mr. Stupid-Germ-Phobia.
-Yeah.

03:38.700 --> 03:41.800
There they are, old Bob Bobcat.

03:41.800 --> 03:44.300
-Teabag.
-Hi, Todd.

03:44.300 --> 03:46.400
Hi. Hi.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.500
Well, congratulations on Alpine soda.

03:48.500 --> 03:50.700
-Bob said you'd do it.
-Yeah.

03:50.700 --> 03:53.400
God, Jamie, if my ex-wife
looked as good as you...

03:53.400 --> 03:56.400
...I'd still be in the middle
of a horrible marriage.

03:58.700 --> 04:02.400
Thank you, Todd.
What a lovely compliment.

04:03.300 --> 04:04.800
Oh, there's Laird.

04:05.500 --> 04:06.700
Laird.

04:07.300 --> 04:09.400
-So that's the young hotshot?
-Yeah.

04:09.400 --> 04:11.600
Harvard M.B.A.
We're planning to kill him.

04:11.600 --> 04:13.100
Do you want in?

04:13.600 --> 04:16.100
-Cassie.
-There he is.

04:16.100 --> 04:20.100
Laird. You know what'd be great?
You going to get me shrimp.

04:20.899 --> 04:22.800
I'm not joking.

04:23.800 --> 04:26.700
Cass, go say hi to Todd.

04:26.700 --> 04:29.000
-What for?
-He likes you. I'll give you 20 bucks.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.300
Can I come?
I read all about him online.

04:31.300 --> 04:34.800
Okay.

04:36.700 --> 04:39.600
Hi, Mr. Mallory.
Good to see you again.

04:40.400 --> 04:43.900
-Oh, Cassie Munro.
-Little Cassie?

04:44.500 --> 04:46.500
Wow, you turned into quite
the young lady.

04:46.500 --> 04:48.000
This is my friend, Gretchen.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.500
-Hi, Gretch.
-Hi.

04:49.500 --> 04:53.400
Aren't you the one who got the public schools system
to put Pure Vibe sodas into the schools?

04:53.400 --> 04:56.600
That was me. Cassie's dad helped,
he's head of Corporate Relations...

04:56.600 --> 04:58.400
...but I am el presidente.

04:58.400 --> 05:01.200
Wow, so you're, like,
personally responsible...

05:01.200 --> 05:03.700
...for destroying the health
of millions of children.

05:03.700 --> 05:06.100
-Gretchen.
-I probably wouldn't put it that way.

05:06.100 --> 05:08.700
Obesity, diabetes, cholesterol.

05:08.700 --> 05:12.200
The fat of our youth is on your hands.
Wallow in it.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.800
Thank you, I had a very nice time.

05:34.100 --> 05:35.800
Keep it real.

05:37.300 --> 05:39.000
Don't.

05:49.300 --> 05:52.200
Yo, home slice,
can you chill on the def jam?

05:52.200 --> 05:54.600
You're boiling my vibe.

05:54.600 --> 05:56.400
Respect.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.200
Cass, can we talk?

06:00.200 --> 06:03.500
-God, what?
-Nothing. My bad.

06:03.500 --> 06:07.100
Father evil. Forgot that.

06:07.100 --> 06:08.800
How you doing, are you all right?

06:08.800 --> 06:11.700
-No, not really.
-Why don't you get that skin peel?

06:12.300 --> 06:14.300
Feels like that.
Cassie was so abrasive--

06:14.300 --> 06:17.900
Oh, Bob just came in.
Let me call you back. My sister.

06:18.600 --> 06:20.600
-Did you talk to Cassie?
-Yeah, I tried.

06:20.600 --> 06:22.000
Still bleeding a little bit.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.000
She didn't know Gretchen
was gonna do that.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.600
She didn't know her friend was gonna
throw a vat of schmaltz on my boss.

06:28.400 --> 06:30.000
Wine or martini?

06:30.000 --> 06:32.900
-Both, with a Prozac back.
-Okay.

06:32.900 --> 06:36.400
Remember when it used to be
"Daddy's home"? Now nothing.

06:36.400 --> 06:38.300
We watch TV
in four separate rooms...

06:38.300 --> 06:40.500
...and we IM each other
when dinner's ready.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.300
Well, then let's change things.

06:42.300 --> 06:44.200
Let's start while we're in Hawaii.

06:44.200 --> 06:46.900
No laptop, no Blackberry,
no business calls.

06:46.900 --> 06:48.600
-Let's really go.
-No what?

06:48.600 --> 06:51.100
You're not gonna see them
for the rest of the summer.

06:51.100 --> 06:52.900
-Carl's got camp--
-Yeah.

06:52.900 --> 06:55.300
Cassie's got college prep
in Palo Alto, I know.

06:55.300 --> 06:58.000
That's right, and they leave
the day after we get back.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.500
It'll be the same in Hawaii. They'll
only call us when they need money.

07:01.500 --> 07:05.100
Well, I'm glad we're going.
And don't worry so much about work.

07:05.100 --> 07:08.200
Todd loves you.
You're indispensable.

07:09.200 --> 07:10.500
I'm afraid not.

07:10.500 --> 07:13.600
I think Laird's gonna get my job.
He's younger, smarter, cheaper.

07:15.000 --> 07:16.600
What did you say?

07:16.600 --> 07:18.100
Nothing.

07:20.300 --> 07:22.300
Here you go.

07:23.200 --> 07:25.300
To true love.

07:26.500 --> 07:29.800
-Hawaii's gonna be great.
-Yeah.

07:30.600 --> 07:32.200
You gotta cancel Hawaii.

07:32.200 --> 07:34.600
-Why?
-We hit a snag in the Alpine merger.

07:34.600 --> 07:37.400
-Since yesterday?
-One brother got seller's remorse.

07:37.400 --> 07:39.000
-Garry.
-Larry.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.200
Garry's still for it.
Show him some money...

07:41.200 --> 07:43.300
...he'll quack like a duck.
Larry's nervous.

07:43.300 --> 07:46.100
If I tell my wife we're not going
to Hawaii, bury me ass-up.

07:46.100 --> 07:47.900
You have a place to park your bike.

07:47.900 --> 07:50.200
-Bob.
-Todd.

07:50.200 --> 07:54.100
Bob. Bob,
this crisis has actually saved your job.

07:54.100 --> 07:56.500
-Really?
-After yesterday...

07:56.500 --> 08:00.500
...I figured I gotta fire you
to maintain some respect around here.

08:00.500 --> 08:03.300
But in light of this Alpine thing...

08:03.600 --> 08:05.800
-...I still need you.
-Bless you, Todd.

08:05.800 --> 08:08.000
I gotta run out there
and make a presentation.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.900
I can write the presentation in Hawaii
and zap it to you.

08:10.900 --> 08:14.900
Laird can write me a presentation.
If I tell him to, he'll live in the office.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.900
He'll shower
in the damn water cooler.

08:16.900 --> 08:19.000
But you've got one thing
he hasn't got.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.800
-A soul.
-No, you're good in a meeting.

08:21.800 --> 08:23.600
You've got the chutzpah.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.800
So I want you
to write that presentation...

08:25.800 --> 08:28.600
...and I need you at the meeting
to put this thing over.

08:28.600 --> 08:30.700
-Yeah.
-So no Hawaii.

08:30.700 --> 08:34.200
-No.
-Boulder, Colorado, Friday.

08:34.200 --> 08:36.100
Just move your Hawaii dates.

08:36.100 --> 08:38.500
The kids are booked
the rest of the summer.

08:38.500 --> 08:41.299
-You have to go to Boulder.
-Agreed.

08:41.299 --> 08:45.300
I want you to know, after the divorce,
I'm coming after Jamie hard.

08:45.500 --> 08:47.000
Bring jewelry.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.600
Hey, if you get Jamie,
can I have Elaine?

08:49.600 --> 08:52.500
-You want Elaine?
-Better than nothing.

08:52.500 --> 08:54.600
Trust me, it's not better.

08:54.600 --> 08:57.500
Elaine is still mad at me
for taking that vacation last year.

08:57.500 --> 08:59.800
Figures that's why
I didn't get that promotion.

08:59.800 --> 09:02.100
-Oh, the RV trip.
-RV trip?

09:02.100 --> 09:05.300
Oh, the famous RV trip.
Oh, can we see the pictures again?

09:05.300 --> 09:07.200
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Nobody move.

09:08.900 --> 09:10.900
Did you rent that RV?

09:18.000 --> 09:22.000
Mom, some idiot just parked
this ugly RV outside our house.

09:22.000 --> 09:23.400
What?

09:26.200 --> 09:28.500
Oh, my God, it's your husband.

09:31.500 --> 09:34.000
-Oh, hi.
-What is that?

09:35.400 --> 09:38.000
-It's an RV.
-And why is it in front of our house?

09:38.000 --> 09:40.800
-We're taking it on vacation.
-To Hawaii?

09:40.800 --> 09:44.400
-No, it doesn't float. Colorado.
-What happened to Hawaii?

09:44.400 --> 09:47.800
Come on, Hawaii's
a winter destination. It's summer.

09:47.800 --> 09:50.900
The place I'm taking you is special,
and not like Uncle Mike.

09:50.900 --> 09:54.700
It's Lake Nirvana,
where I went with my parents as a kid.

09:54.700 --> 09:56.900
Is he being funny?
Because I can never tell.

09:56.900 --> 09:59.400
Oh, come on.
You've always wanted to camp, right?

09:59.400 --> 10:02.200
This is what he came up with
to punish me for Gretchen.

10:02.200 --> 10:04.700
I was gonna surf.
Nice one, Dad. Thanks.

10:04.700 --> 10:06.800
The hotel in Hawaii
has a weight room.

10:06.800 --> 10:09.900
Doesn't anybody
respect my lifting schedule?

10:13.700 --> 10:16.800
We're not campers. We don't camp.

10:16.800 --> 10:19.800
-Why not?
-Why--? Why not?

10:19.800 --> 10:22.900
-For one thing, we like to shower.
-Well, it's got a shower.

10:22.900 --> 10:25.300
You and I will go out right now
and take a shower.

10:25.300 --> 10:28.300
Bob, do you know where you stay
when you take an RV trip?

10:28.300 --> 10:30.200
-Where?
-RV camps.

10:30.200 --> 10:32.700
Honey, try to remember,
we're not friendly.

10:32.700 --> 10:34.500
In Hawaii, we'll never see the kids.

10:34.500 --> 10:36.300
This way,
we can spend time with them.

10:38.100 --> 10:39.700
You need to spend time with them.

10:39.700 --> 10:42.900
I spend nine hours a day with them.
And I want Hawaii.

10:42.900 --> 10:44.800
All right, we'll go to Hawaii.

10:44.800 --> 10:47.900
At Christmas. Then it will just be us
and a lot of Jewish people.

10:47.900 --> 10:50.700
-We'll have all the ham to ourselves.
-I'll have to cook.

10:50.700 --> 10:53.500
No, you won't, because I'll cook
every night, every meal.

10:53.500 --> 10:57.000
We were gonna take naps.
Hotel room, afternoon...

10:57.000 --> 10:59.900
-...lock-the-door naps.
-Oh, the good naps.

10:59.900 --> 11:03.300
-How are we gonna do that in an RV?
-I'll drive slowly.

11:03.300 --> 11:06.300
-I was gonna get a massage.
-I'll give you a massage.

11:06.300 --> 11:08.800
You're gonna do all the cooking,
give me massages.

11:08.800 --> 11:10.100
And spend time with the kids.

11:10.400 --> 11:12.000
You got it.

11:13.300 --> 11:16.700
Did you cancel our Hawaii trip
because Todd told you to?

11:16.700 --> 11:20.000
Did you volunteer us
for some sort of experiment?

11:20.000 --> 11:23.100
The family travels around and drinks
nothing but Pure Vibe soda...

11:23.100 --> 11:24.500
...see if our teeth fall out?

11:24.500 --> 11:27.700
Honey, I'm running out of time
with my kids.

11:30.800 --> 11:34.000
Come on, baby. Why don't you
come out in the wilderness...

11:34.000 --> 11:36.600
...with your big, brawny man?

11:36.600 --> 11:39.500
Don't make me call
for my mail-order bride.

11:42.500 --> 11:44.400
Bob.

11:45.900 --> 11:48.600
Here's something your genius
husband probably overlooked.

11:48.600 --> 11:50.300
Four miles to the gallon?

11:50.300 --> 11:54.200
Gee, why don't we just stay home
and set fire to an oil field.

11:56.200 --> 11:58.100
There's an elegant touch.

12:00.600 --> 12:03.400
Or we could just travel around
in clown suits.

12:04.000 --> 12:08.000
I spent the night with my head
in the toilet. I'm sure it's contagious.

12:10.400 --> 12:14.200
All right, no more details.
Just e-mail me the new proposal.

12:18.100 --> 12:19.900
-That's my couch. Move.
-Make me.

12:25.400 --> 12:27.200
-This seat's better, anyway.
-Whatever.

12:43.800 --> 12:47.100
Welcome aboard, everybody.
Before we embark...

12:47.100 --> 12:49.700
...I think we should give
this beauty a name. Suggestions?

12:50.700 --> 12:52.300
The Big Turd.

12:53.200 --> 12:55.400
The Big Rolling Turd.

12:55.400 --> 12:58.500
In that spirit, we set forth.

13:35.700 --> 13:37.200
Make it so, Number One.

13:43.600 --> 13:45.600
Honey, are you sure know how to--?

13:45.600 --> 13:47.200
-Honey?
-Trust me, okay?

13:51.300 --> 13:52.800
Thanks.

13:54.100 --> 13:55.500
Oh, my God.

13:59.900 --> 14:02.200
-Honey, honey.
-What?

14:02.200 --> 14:04.600
-Oh, tree.
-Yeah, it's all right.

14:08.800 --> 14:10.300
Honey?

14:10.300 --> 14:11.900
Honey. Honey.

14:11.900 --> 14:13.700
Oh, my God.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.500
-We're okay.
-Honey.

14:17.700 --> 14:19.800
Honey, tree! Tree!

14:21.500 --> 14:23.300
Honey, honey.

14:26.600 --> 14:29.600
-Honey.
-Okay.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.300
Anything else you want to hit?

14:43.000 --> 14:45.200
Do you want to go back?
We missed the neighbor's cat.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.800
You are 31 hours
from your destination.

14:54.800 --> 14:57.300
-What's that?
-Road Mate 700.

14:57.300 --> 14:59.900
-I call her "Lola."
-Make a right in 100 feet.

14:59.900 --> 15:01.400
Thank you, Lola.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.300
She's accurate to within 10 feet.

15:03.300 --> 15:05.700
-Go straight.
-No, Lola says take a right.

15:05.700 --> 15:07.900
-Well, mall traffic. Go straight.
-Fifty feet.

15:07.900 --> 15:11.500
-Yeah, but she said take a right.
-Well, I'm telling you to go straight.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.400
Twenty feet.

15:13.400 --> 15:15.900
-Choose.
-Baby, please.

15:15.900 --> 15:17.500
-Turn right.
-Choose.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.900
-Dad!
-Turn right.

15:32.100 --> 15:34.200
My bad.

15:34.200 --> 15:36.800
-You are 30 hours and 59 minutes--
-Turn her off.

15:36.800 --> 15:38.900
--from your destination.

15:42.200 --> 15:43.800
Say, Dad, this is interesting.

15:43.800 --> 15:46.100
"Unsecured items
in an unlatched cabinet...

15:46.100 --> 15:49.600
...are a recipe for disaster."
Didn't you read this?

15:49.600 --> 15:53.000
No, I was too busy thinking
of all the ways we're gonna have fun.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.100
Dad, somebody's stealing the RV.

15:56.700 --> 15:58.400
No, Carl. Nobody's stealing it...

15:58.400 --> 16:00.300
...it's rolling backwards
with no one in it.

16:07.100 --> 16:08.700
Oh, yeah. Well, my bad.

16:08.700 --> 16:11.700
Yeah, well, yeah.

16:11.700 --> 16:13.300
-Thanks, Saul.
-Irv.

16:13.300 --> 16:14.700
-Irv.
-Not "Saul. "

16:14.700 --> 16:17.100
I don't know where I got Saul.

16:17.400 --> 16:19.200
Well, thanks.

16:19.200 --> 16:20.600
-Good news.
-I'm adopted?

16:20.600 --> 16:23.800
Good one. No,
thanks to my technically proficient...

16:23.800 --> 16:26.200
...and charmingly amusing description,
Saul--

16:26.200 --> 16:31.000
-Irv.
-Irv, yeah. Irv the dealer...

16:31.000 --> 16:34.400
...said we damaged the parking-gear
interlock and the emergency brake.

16:34.400 --> 16:37.400
We had that little mishap, you know,
when Mom distracted me...

16:37.400 --> 16:39.300
...we were pulling out of the driveway?

16:39.300 --> 16:42.300
But the driving brakes,
the ones we use when we're moving...

16:42.300 --> 16:45.000
...they're fine.
They're not just fine, they're brilliant.

16:45.400 --> 16:47.600
All we have to do
is every time we park...

16:47.600 --> 16:50.300
...we have to put two big blocks
under the rear wheel.

16:50.300 --> 16:53.700
We'll be perfect. Thanks for the help.
Okay, everybody, come on.

16:53.700 --> 16:56.400
It'll be fun, let's go.
Miles and smiles.

16:56.400 --> 16:58.400
This is the worst
I've ever been treated.

16:58.400 --> 17:00.800
-Wait till you get married.
-Thank you.

17:00.800 --> 17:03.300
Everybody, let's get aboard
the Big Rolling Turd.

18:59.800 --> 19:01.500
That was easy.

19:16.100 --> 19:18.300
Now what do we do?

19:18.300 --> 19:21.100
Hey, I know, let's go to the beach
and go surfing.

19:21.800 --> 19:25.000
Wait a minute, I forgot.
We're not in Hawaii.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.100
We're where NASA faked
the moon landing.

19:28.800 --> 19:30.300
Wait a minute.

19:32.500 --> 19:36.500
Wait till you see this.
It's called a "pop-out."

19:40.900 --> 19:42.500
Hold on.

19:51.900 --> 19:53.900
Wow, where are you?

20:01.000 --> 20:04.200
-How cool is that?
-Macarena cool.

20:05.500 --> 20:06.500
Hey.

20:08.800 --> 20:12.000
You guys want to see a movie?
But where?

20:18.200 --> 20:20.700
Forgive my ignorance,
but don't you need to hook up...

20:20.700 --> 20:24.100
...the Big Rolling Turd
to the electricity for that?

20:25.200 --> 20:26.900
Yes, I do.

20:46.700 --> 20:49.900
I gotta take a crap.
Time to break in the pooper.

20:51.900 --> 20:54.400
You are so disgusting.

20:57.800 --> 21:01.400
Dad! The toilet's backed up!

21:12.600 --> 21:14.800
Carl, what did you eat?

21:14.800 --> 21:17.700
Dad, it's not mine.

21:23.000 --> 21:25.700
There's the problem,
sewage tank is overflowing.

21:25.700 --> 21:27.800
And it's not even our sewage,
it's leftover.

21:27.800 --> 21:29.600
It's not a national emergency.

21:29.600 --> 21:31.500
We'll go to where
you dump the sewage...

21:31.500 --> 21:33.900
...and we'll dump the dump.
Come on, let's all go.

21:33.900 --> 21:37.600
As appealing as that sounds,
I think I'm gonna pass. But thank you.

21:37.600 --> 21:40.600
And don't forget,
you're making dinner.

21:42.100 --> 21:45.000
Sure, I'd love to clean
somebody else's crap out of the RV...

21:45.000 --> 21:47.100
...instead of being in Hawaii.

21:49.200 --> 21:50.800
Can I come?

21:50.800 --> 21:54.200
Not only can you come,
you can dump the sewage.

21:54.200 --> 21:55.600
-Really?
-Yeah.

21:55.600 --> 21:58.900
It's gonna be a regular
Field of Dreams moment, buddy.

22:18.600 --> 22:20.400
Piece of cake.

22:54.200 --> 22:57.000
-Gonna be a while, mister?
-Oh, well, that depends.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.300
If I can get this hose attached
to this outlet...

22:59.300 --> 23:01.000
...I'll be right out of here.

23:01.800 --> 23:05.000
-What's the dealie?
-Guy needs to attach a hose.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.200
Doing it.

23:07.900 --> 23:10.300
-What's up?
-Trying to attach a hose.

23:10.300 --> 23:14.100
-Fella here's trying to hook up a hose.
-Maybe get on the loudspeaker.

23:14.100 --> 23:16.700
That there's the wrong hose.
It's that there one.

23:17.900 --> 23:19.300
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

23:19.300 --> 23:20.900
-It's got the coupling.
-Right.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.600
That one right there.

23:23.100 --> 23:26.000
-There you go.
-Okay.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.600
You need another hose.

23:32.200 --> 23:35.300
Yeah, I guess, but....

23:35.300 --> 23:37.900
It's long enough, but:

23:37.900 --> 23:40.000
Gotta get one of them
bayonet couplings.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.700
-He hasn't got one.
-He's got a Y-coupling right there.

23:42.700 --> 23:44.800
Yeah, that'll do the trick.

23:44.800 --> 23:46.800
Y-coupling?

23:46.800 --> 23:48.900
A Y-coupling.

23:48.900 --> 23:50.800
That's the Y. Oh, I see.

23:51.600 --> 23:53.600
-One potato.
-Alrighty.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.000
Two potato.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.400
-Okay, wait, oh.
-There we go.

23:57.400 --> 23:59.900
Listen,
I'm no expert in waste management...

23:59.900 --> 24:03.500
...but won't the fecal matter
come out the top hole there?

24:04.900 --> 24:07.700
No, you just gotta hold it
up in the air like this:

24:07.700 --> 24:10.700
There you go. Little bit higher.
There you go.

24:10.700 --> 24:13.100
-Oh, like that there.
-There you go.

24:13.100 --> 24:15.100
You sure this is gonna work?

24:15.100 --> 24:17.400
Heck, yeah, man.
It's basic hydraulics.

24:17.400 --> 24:18.800
Okay, Archimedes.

24:18.800 --> 24:20.100
Hey, Joe Joe.

24:23.200 --> 24:25.100
-Okay.
-Let her rip.

24:35.800 --> 24:37.600
Turn it off!

24:41.600 --> 24:44.500
-That sure didn't work.
-No.

24:44.500 --> 24:46.700
-We need a hose spreader.
-Who's got one?

24:46.700 --> 24:48.400
Gornicke, I think. I'll get it.

24:48.400 --> 24:50.300
-I'll get some music.
-Oh, no, please.

24:50.300 --> 24:51.900
And some of those tortilla chips.

24:51.900 --> 24:54.000
-We got some leftover sausages.
-Bring them.

24:54.000 --> 24:57.500
No, you folks don't need to have
a parade. I don't want to impose.

24:57.500 --> 24:59.200
Oh, no, no.

24:59.200 --> 25:02.600
We are gonna get this
fixed up for you, buddy.

25:08.200 --> 25:09.700
Sausages.

25:10.600 --> 25:12.800
Sausages.

25:13.800 --> 25:15.700
Sausages.

25:16.400 --> 25:18.400
-Right here, you want one?
-Yeah.

25:19.800 --> 25:23.400
There we go. That'll work.

25:23.400 --> 25:25.300
You sure this will hold?

25:25.300 --> 25:28.100
Hey, man, why would they sell you
a hose spreader...

25:28.100 --> 25:30.100
...if you couldn't spread the hose?

25:30.100 --> 25:32.200
It's getting old. Come on.

25:32.600 --> 25:33.900
Open it up, Joe Joe.

25:40.200 --> 25:42.200
It's blocked. I'll flush the line.

25:49.300 --> 25:52.000
-Hey, Dad.
-Son.

25:52.000 --> 25:54.400
Maybe now is the time
to confess to you that...

25:54.400 --> 25:57.000
...your dad's not the master
of all things.

25:57.600 --> 26:00.300
I got that when you started
taking advice from morons.

26:00.300 --> 26:02.900
Yeah. All we need is a banjo.

26:02.900 --> 26:07.900
Oh, man. He didn't even open it up
all the way.

26:12.000 --> 26:15.600
-See? No worries.
-Yup.

26:18.400 --> 26:19.800
-Hello.
-Bob.

26:19.800 --> 26:23.100
Hey, Todd.
Yeah, I'm still pretty sick.

26:23.500 --> 26:26.000
-Where's my presentation?
-Presentation?

26:26.000 --> 26:28.800
It's the best work I've done,
not to toot my own horn....

26:28.800 --> 26:32.400
-Yeah, you'll have it Thursday morning.
-Thursday?

26:32.400 --> 26:34.700
No, that's not soon enough.
Tomorrow will be great.

26:36.900 --> 26:38.500
Oh, I gotta go.

26:41.700 --> 26:43.300
Oh, dude, that is nasty.

26:44.600 --> 26:46.900
Don't worry, I'll get another hose.

26:46.900 --> 26:49.400
Fire in the hole!

27:25.400 --> 27:27.800
Here's where you made your
critical mistake.

27:27.800 --> 27:30.300
You listened to anything
Howie and Joe Joe said.

27:30.300 --> 27:33.500
Nice boys, but they're a couple pliers
short of a tool chest.

27:33.900 --> 27:37.300
They're not the ones covered
in fecal matter.

27:37.300 --> 27:39.300
That's a good point.

27:41.100 --> 27:43.100
Travis Gornicke.

27:46.600 --> 27:48.300
Bob Munro.

27:48.300 --> 27:50.200
Yeah, let's postpone
that handshake...

27:50.200 --> 27:52.000
-...till we get you cleaned up.
-Yeah.

28:07.200 --> 28:10.100
You're clean enough to use
your own shower, Bob.

28:10.700 --> 28:12.400
The vehicle's all cleaned up, Daddy.

28:12.400 --> 28:14.500
-Oh, nice work, son.
-Thank you, boys.

28:14.500 --> 28:16.400
-You're welcome.
-No problem, Mr. Munro.

28:16.400 --> 28:19.700
-Look, can I offer you a--
-No, Bob, wouldn't think of it.

28:19.700 --> 28:21.700
-We're neighbors.
-Mom wants to know--

28:21.700 --> 28:23.000
What happened to you?

28:25.500 --> 28:27.600
He was covered in turd.

28:27.600 --> 28:29.600
Oh, I know the feeling.

28:29.900 --> 28:32.100
Mom wants to know when
you're cooking dinner.

28:32.100 --> 28:35.200
You tell your mother when I'm good
and ready, that's when.

28:35.600 --> 28:39.500
-I'll tell her.
-Tell her I'm good and ready.

28:39.500 --> 28:41.300
Well, thanks.

28:41.300 --> 28:44.700
Hey,
pleasure hosing you down, Bob.

28:44.700 --> 28:47.800
-Ditto.
-Why can't they have dinner with us?

28:48.500 --> 28:50.900
You know, aside from the stink,
I don't see why not.

28:50.900 --> 28:53.400
Why don't you come on over?
Tuesday's meatloaf.

28:53.400 --> 28:57.400
Then afterwards, we can sit around
and watch Ernest Goes to Jail.

28:57.400 --> 29:00.300
-It is funny.
-Well, it's a classic.

29:00.300 --> 29:04.100
-Yeah, we'll make a whole night of it.
-I wish I could.

29:04.100 --> 29:06.400
I promised my family
I'd make my special dish...

29:06.400 --> 29:09.100
-...shish kebob.
-Oh, that's good.

29:09.100 --> 29:11.700
-Well, another time, then.
-Yeah, try to keep me away.

29:11.700 --> 29:13.600
Okay.

29:16.100 --> 29:17.500
Carl!

29:22.700 --> 29:25.900
-Honey, how's it going?
-Great, baby.

29:25.900 --> 29:29.400
Okay, well, how long?
Because we're starving.

29:30.500 --> 29:33.500
Four hours.
Maybe longer if you keep asking.

29:34.300 --> 29:36.900
-What?
-It's a small oven...

29:36.900 --> 29:40.600
...and I'm having to do the potatoes
with a hair dryer set on "high".

29:45.800 --> 29:49.100
Hey, who wants to go to a party?

29:55.100 --> 29:58.800
-Here we are. Hope we're not late.
-No!

29:58.800 --> 30:00.900
-Well, Bob said we were invited.
-Yeah.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.400
-Of course you were.
-Then here we are.

30:03.400 --> 30:06.000
-We're hungry.
-All right!

30:06.000 --> 30:08.700
-Mary Jo, our company's here.
-What company?

30:08.700 --> 30:11.800
The ones that are close enough
to hear you yelling, darling.

30:12.700 --> 30:14.600
-Well, hi.
-Hi.

30:14.600 --> 30:16.200
Honey, help me.

30:16.200 --> 30:18.200
-I've got you here, darling.
-Here you go.

30:18.200 --> 30:20.500
Let's see. Earl and Billy you met.

30:20.500 --> 30:23.100
-Hi, I'm Earl.
-And I'm not.

30:23.100 --> 30:26.600
My wife, Mary Jo,
and my daughter, Moon.

30:26.900 --> 30:28.700
Hey, y'all.

30:33.800 --> 30:38.400
Well, Moon, that's kind of a hippie
name, like Moon, Rainbow, Bong.

30:38.900 --> 30:40.500
She was named after Warren Moon.

30:40.500 --> 30:42.300
He was quarterback of the
Houston Oilers.

30:44.700 --> 30:47.600
Well, this is my wife, Jamie.

30:47.600 --> 30:50.700
Cassie, my daughter.
My son, Carl.

30:50.700 --> 30:53.500
Named after Karl Marx...

30:53.500 --> 30:56.300
...socialist, some would say
the father of modern communism.

31:00.300 --> 31:03.500
As I'm throwing up with the blood
pouring out of my eyes, you know...

31:03.500 --> 31:07.000
...I looked up and I said,
"Who is that lovely...?"

31:07.000 --> 31:09.300
Next day, we were married
in Juárez.

31:09.300 --> 31:11.700
Nine months later...out popped Earl.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.300
So you got a boyfriend?

31:15.300 --> 31:18.500
-Yeah, actually, I'm engaged.
-Unlikely.

31:19.300 --> 31:21.300
So where are you guys from?

31:21.300 --> 31:23.200
Where do you hang your hat,
as it were.

31:23.200 --> 31:25.100
-Behind the wheel of that bus.
-Really?

31:25.100 --> 31:26.300
-Full-timer, U.S.A.
-Really?

31:26.800 --> 31:30.800
Well, how do Moon, Earl and not Earl
go to school?

31:31.000 --> 31:32.600
Home school.

31:33.400 --> 31:36.300
I hope you don't find
this next question too personal...

31:36.300 --> 31:39.300
-...but how do you...?
-Make a living? Various ways.

31:39.300 --> 31:42.900
Let's see. We made $25,000 when
we turned in Mary Jo's step dad.

31:42.900 --> 31:44.600
In prison
he's getting help he needs.

31:45.100 --> 31:47.700
Oh, and I almost forgot,
Mary Jo makes a living.

31:47.700 --> 31:52.300
I mean, she earns $60,000 a year
without ever leaving that bus.

31:52.300 --> 31:54.400
Really? Hooking?

31:58.800 --> 32:02.700
-Funny.
-I'm a mobile sales rep for Happy Max.

32:02.700 --> 32:05.800
Y'all seen the infomercials
for our musical car horns?

32:05.800 --> 32:07.900
-No, I don't think we have.
-No.

32:07.900 --> 32:10.000
Billy White Shoes,
blow that horn.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.200
-Watch this.
-Wait for it.

32:12.200 --> 32:14.300
I love it every time.

32:19.300 --> 32:22.300
Wow, that's fantastic. That was....

32:22.800 --> 32:24.600
Jamie, are you
a stay-at-home mom?

32:24.600 --> 32:26.200
-Yes.
-When there's not a sale.

32:26.200 --> 32:28.000
Let me hook you up with Happy Max.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.300
I got a rep bag in the bus.

32:30.300 --> 32:32.500
Plus, I represent
Lovely Lily Beauty Products.

32:32.500 --> 32:36.100
-Mary Jo's a trained cosmetologist.
-If you're still here tomorrow...

32:36.100 --> 32:39.700
...I'm going to give you a complete,
free total makeover.

32:39.700 --> 32:42.600
A $39 package absolutely free.

32:42.600 --> 32:44.500
-Oh, that would be good, honey.
-No.

32:44.500 --> 32:47.700
You know what, I'm gonna work on you
the whole day tomorrow.

32:48.700 --> 32:51.900
-There you go, little lady.
-Oh, I'm sorry, I don't eat meat.

32:51.900 --> 32:54.500
I heard you talking.
That's why I brought you this here.

32:54.500 --> 32:56.800
-There ain't no meat in it.
-Oh, no meat?

32:57.200 --> 32:59.600
You here that? No meat.
Thank you. That's lovely.

32:59.600 --> 33:01.600
That's right. It's all organs.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.600
Deer organs. They're fresh too.

33:04.600 --> 33:07.800
I run him over this morning.
The rest of it's curing in the bedroom.

33:07.800 --> 33:11.200
But the stomach, brains and pancreas,
we just toss that into the stew...

33:11.200 --> 33:13.000
...because in this heat,
it doesn't keep.

33:13.600 --> 33:17.200
-Bathroom.
-Little lady....

33:27.000 --> 33:28.900
-There's my girl.
-Dad, can we please go?

33:28.900 --> 33:31.600
Yes. You know,
thank you so much for the invitation.

33:31.600 --> 33:34.600
This has been great. A lot of fun.

33:34.600 --> 33:36.700
Dad, listen.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
This is kind of our family theme song.

33:40.000 --> 33:44.000
Kids, come on. Get up there, go, go.
Hurry up, get the-- You know.

33:44.100 --> 33:46.100
Oh, they're gonna love this.

33:46.100 --> 33:48.900
Little Mommy's got a whole
song-and-dance thing worked out.

33:48.900 --> 33:51.500
-Oh, that's wonderful.
-Come on, Moon, come on.

33:51.500 --> 33:53.500
-Here I go. Thank you, darling.
-Thank you.

33:53.500 --> 33:56.800
-Oh, yeah.
-Line up the way we practiced.

34:59.500 --> 35:03.000
I never grow tired of that song.
Last time I heard it I was buck-naked...

35:03.000 --> 35:05.300
-...in a field with a road flare.
-Dad.

35:05.300 --> 35:07.000
Yes. Big travel day tomorrow.

35:07.000 --> 35:08.600
-Where y'all headed?
-Away.

35:08.600 --> 35:10.800
Mount Watson in Colorado.

35:10.800 --> 35:13.900
-Just fantastic to have met you both.
-Same here.

35:13.900 --> 35:16.400
-Hope we see you again.
-How about breakfast tomorrow?

35:16.400 --> 35:21.300
-Bagels and deer testicles?
-Oh, yeah, she's funny, just like you.

35:22.800 --> 35:25.000
We'd have breakfast,
but we're early risers.

35:25.000 --> 35:28.200
-Well, us too. 6 a.m. work for you?
-We'll be long gone by then.

35:28.200 --> 35:30.200
Yeah, trust us.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.400
Bob? Bob?

35:37.400 --> 35:39.700
-Let's go, let's go. Bob?
-Yeah, baby.

35:40.400 --> 35:43.400
-Oh, friendly folks.
-Yeah, they're nice people.

36:45.500 --> 36:48.700
-Hi, Mr. Munro.
-Hi, Billy. I'm just--

36:50.200 --> 36:53.200
-You sure got a nice one.
-What?

36:53.200 --> 36:55.600
That's a nice laptop.

36:55.600 --> 36:59.100
Oh, thanks. What are you doing up?

36:59.100 --> 37:02.900
I have a sleep disorder.
I haven't slept since I was 5.

37:02.900 --> 37:05.200
So you just wander around
the campground.

37:05.200 --> 37:09.700
Yeah, I don't really mind.
It's the only time I have alone.

37:10.600 --> 37:13.700
Well, see you.

37:37.700 --> 37:39.500
Oh, okay.

38:14.800 --> 38:18.100
-Morning.
-Good morning, Mr. Munro.

38:32.900 --> 38:35.300
-Come on. Come on, let's go.
-It's 5:30.

38:35.300 --> 38:37.300
The Gornickes.

38:38.100 --> 38:40.200
Bob, a little help.

38:41.000 --> 38:43.300
Little help? Cassie?

38:43.300 --> 38:46.900
There's movement.
She-- She's moving.

38:46.900 --> 38:49.400
Carl, let's get going.

38:52.600 --> 38:56.100
Let's move it, let's move it.
Bob, gun it.

38:56.800 --> 38:59.600
Carl. Cass, what's our status?

38:59.600 --> 39:02.900
She's out the door. She's coming.
Mayday, mayday, she's coming!

39:04.100 --> 39:07.400
Come on. Let's go, let's go.
Go, go, go!

39:10.300 --> 39:12.300
-Come on!
-It's in gear, but it's not moving.

39:13.700 --> 39:16.400
-The wheel!
-This stupid pop-out thing.

39:18.700 --> 39:20.400
Hurry, Mom, she's coming!

39:33.700 --> 39:35.100
Come on, come on, come on.

39:36.700 --> 39:38.400
Will you move this son of a bi--

39:44.600 --> 39:45.900
Hey!

40:02.700 --> 40:04.400
They are early risers.

40:24.200 --> 40:26.800
I'm going a whole 12 miles an hour.

40:26.800 --> 40:28.500
Then pass him.

40:35.300 --> 40:38.300
Kids, leave him alone.
He's not that good a driver.

40:42.700 --> 40:44.100
Really.

40:48.800 --> 40:50.800
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

40:56.800 --> 40:59.700
-Come on.
-Bob.

40:59.700 --> 41:02.900
Bob. Bob. Bob.

41:07.300 --> 41:08.700
Bob.

41:17.100 --> 41:18.400
All right.

41:19.000 --> 41:22.400
-Okay. All right.
-Thanks.

41:23.700 --> 41:25.100
-Hey, guess what.
-What?

41:25.100 --> 41:26.900
We need gas.

41:27.900 --> 41:29.800
And I really have to go
to the bathroom.

41:29.800 --> 41:31.600
You know we have one of those.

41:31.600 --> 41:34.300
Yeah, but after my last little
shower of sadness....

41:34.300 --> 41:37.000
Okay, okay, do what you have to do.

41:37.400 --> 41:40.100
I've got an ICBM coming.

41:42.100 --> 41:45.300
If there's a poop fairy,
I can make a lot of money.

42:16.400 --> 42:20.400
I could be a while, baby.
It's an 80-gallon tank.

42:33.700 --> 42:34.900
Dad, you in here?

42:36.000 --> 42:37.900
Carl, I just need a minute.

42:37.900 --> 42:39.800
Sure, only the RV's rolling away.

42:40.900 --> 42:42.600
Be right out.

42:50.400 --> 42:52.500
-Hey, Bob.
-Travis.

42:52.500 --> 42:55.700
Yeah, I think you've got
a little problem with your vehicle.

42:55.700 --> 42:57.500
I'm no expert...

42:57.500 --> 43:00.600
...but it's your parking-gear
interlock and your emergency brake.

43:00.600 --> 43:02.400
-How did you...?
-It's a miracle.

43:02.400 --> 43:04.900
We pulled in
the second it started rolling away.

43:04.900 --> 43:07.300
Isn't that something?
Wanna hear about the time...

43:07.300 --> 43:09.700
-...Jesus saved us from a tornado?
-It's great.

43:09.700 --> 43:12.000
I'd love to,
but I was in the little boys' room...

43:12.000 --> 43:14.500
...taking care of business
when Carl interrupted...

43:14.500 --> 43:16.700
...but Jamie would love to hear it.

43:16.700 --> 43:18.900
Well, it seems just like yesterday.

43:50.900 --> 43:52.500
Thank you.

43:54.500 --> 43:56.800
I don't wanna get too big,
you know.

43:56.800 --> 44:01.700
-I mean, I don't want to look freakish.
-No.

44:06.000 --> 44:08.300
-What is this?
-It's a list of places...

44:08.300 --> 44:11.100
...between here and Colorado
that sell organic health food.

44:11.100 --> 44:15.700
-I got it last night off the Internet.
-Oh, that was really thoughtful.

44:15.700 --> 44:19.100
-What are you listening to?
-Nothing.

44:19.100 --> 44:21.300
So Billy was blown
right out of that tree.

44:21.300 --> 44:23.800
Right before he hit the ground,
from out of nowhere...

44:23.800 --> 44:25.900
...comes this queen-size
Simmons mattress...

44:25.900 --> 44:28.200
...slides right under him
and cushions his fall.

44:28.200 --> 44:30.700
Saved his life.
Plus, we needed the mattress.

44:30.700 --> 44:32.400
I have a bad back.

44:32.400 --> 44:35.100
So you folks wanna join us
for breakfast?

44:35.100 --> 44:36.500
-We--
-Ate.

44:36.500 --> 44:38.700
Mr. Munro,
I was just telling Earl and Moon...

44:38.700 --> 44:40.600
...about that neat laptop
you were using.

44:40.900 --> 44:43.500
-When were you using a laptop?
-At work, all the time.

44:43.500 --> 44:45.700
-I was just telling him--
-When did he see you?

44:45.700 --> 44:47.700
You know,
we'd love to join you for breakfast.

44:51.500 --> 44:54.300
-Somebody's ripe.
-Welcome to my world.

44:55.600 --> 44:58.200
You guys go on in, get that table.
We'll be right there.

44:58.200 --> 45:00.500
All right. Come on, kids.

45:05.500 --> 45:07.200
-We're ditching them?
-Absolutely.

45:07.200 --> 45:09.100
-Okay.
-Kids, move.

45:11.700 --> 45:14.400
So because you told them
we were early risers...

45:14.400 --> 45:16.000
...we had to get up at 5:30...

45:16.000 --> 45:17.800
-...to avoid the Gornickes...
-Right.

45:17.800 --> 45:19.700
...which we managed not to do
anyway...

45:19.700 --> 45:23.600
...because you refused to use the
bathroom on the RV that you rented.

45:23.600 --> 45:26.100
You're determined
to have a bad time, aren't you?

45:26.100 --> 45:27.300
We all are, Dad.

45:28.200 --> 45:32.200
Not me. I embrace every challenge.

45:42.500 --> 45:45.300
Honey, maybe they just got
some bad news and had to leave.

45:45.300 --> 45:48.500
You're a sweet woman, Mary Jo.
It's what I love about you.

45:48.500 --> 45:50.600
But them folks ditched us.

45:53.900 --> 45:57.100
Oh, Trav, honey, pull over.
Let's pull over.

45:57.600 --> 46:00.000
He looks like a folk singer.

46:00.900 --> 46:02.400
-Climb aboard.
-Hello there.

46:02.400 --> 46:04.100
-How you doing, buddy?
-Sir.

46:04.100 --> 46:05.700
Welcome to the Gornicke bus.

46:06.600 --> 46:08.700
You a folk singer?

46:30.900 --> 46:33.200
Cass,
can you turn on the oven for me?

46:33.200 --> 46:35.200
I am so bored.

46:35.200 --> 46:37.500
I could actually throw up
from how bored I am.

46:37.500 --> 46:41.400
I brought games.
Sorry!, Monopoly, Twister.

46:41.400 --> 46:44.000
-Come on, it'll be fun.
-Fun.

46:44.000 --> 46:45.300
Did you turn on the oven?

46:45.300 --> 46:47.000
-No.
-I'll do it.

46:53.800 --> 46:55.900
-Raccoon in the oven!
-Oh, please. No.

46:55.900 --> 46:57.100
Don't open it.

47:02.500 --> 47:04.800
Did you take out the roast
from last night?

47:04.800 --> 47:06.900
-I guess not.
-What's the plan?

47:06.900 --> 47:08.600
Give him Carl. Maybe he'll eat him.

47:08.600 --> 47:10.600
Give him you.
He's on the South Bitch Diet.

47:10.600 --> 47:12.400
-Good one.
-Okay, hey.

47:12.400 --> 47:15.000
Hey, come on. Don't you see
what the raccoon's doing?

47:15.000 --> 47:17.800
He's playing head games.
He wants to divide and conquer us.

47:17.800 --> 47:19.600
We have to hang together,
stay strong.

47:19.600 --> 47:22.000
-Just get rid of it.
-Just me?

47:22.000 --> 47:24.700
-Yeah.
-Okay.

47:28.800 --> 47:30.600
Come on, Blue.
There's coons in there.

47:30.600 --> 47:32.100
-Come on, boy.
-Bob.

47:32.100 --> 47:35.000
-Go get him, boy.
-Bob.

47:45.800 --> 47:47.400
Just kidding.

47:48.600 --> 47:50.100
I'm going in.

47:52.200 --> 47:53.600
Is anyone gonna stop me?

47:53.600 --> 47:56.100
"Dad, don't.
The raccoon might have rabies"?

47:56.100 --> 47:57.600
Nothing? Not a word?

47:58.200 --> 47:59.400
Not really.

48:03.300 --> 48:05.000
-Daddy?
-Yeah, baby.

48:05.900 --> 48:07.800
Don't hurt him.

48:15.500 --> 48:19.000
I am entering the RV.

48:21.100 --> 48:23.100
Still no sign.

48:23.100 --> 48:26.300
I'm going towards the oven door.

48:26.800 --> 48:30.100
I'm opening the ov--

48:30.100 --> 48:32.800
Oh, my God!

48:33.900 --> 48:36.000
There's more than one!

48:37.800 --> 48:39.300
You guys, he's just joking around.

48:49.600 --> 48:51.000
Get back.

48:51.500 --> 48:53.500
Back. Back! Back!

48:53.500 --> 48:55.200
You hideous--

48:59.600 --> 49:01.200
We need a new plan.

49:26.200 --> 49:29.500
All right, let's go.
You're off the Gornicke bus.

49:29.500 --> 49:31.100
I didn't steal it. I found it.

49:31.100 --> 49:33.900
Well, now you lost it.

49:38.500 --> 49:40.500
That's why they didn't
come to breakfast.

49:40.500 --> 49:43.800
He Lost his computer, he needs it.
They went off frantic to find it.

49:43.800 --> 49:46.000
I was quick to think the worst.

49:46.000 --> 49:48.000
I'm filled with chagrin.

49:49.000 --> 49:50.400
Oh, honey.

49:52.500 --> 49:54.200
-What is that?
-It's a stink bomb.

49:54.600 --> 49:56.900
Got it from the guy in the office.
Cost me $175.

49:56.900 --> 49:59.300
I can get this for five bucks online,
I know it.

49:59.300 --> 50:01.300
You're gonna set that off in the RV?

50:01.300 --> 50:04.400
He assured me it's not toxic.
Just noxious, like Grandpa Ted.

50:05.800 --> 50:07.200
Don't litter.

50:11.200 --> 50:13.300
Suck on this, Rocky.

50:19.700 --> 50:21.200
Yeah!

50:23.200 --> 50:25.100
Run, critters.

50:25.100 --> 50:28.100
Yeah, there's more where
that came from, you little bandits.

50:28.100 --> 50:29.800
Yeah!

50:31.500 --> 50:34.900
I'm not so ill-equipped to handle an
emergency as some people may think.

50:34.900 --> 50:37.800
-No one said you were ill-equipped.
-You know it, baby.

50:37.800 --> 50:39.400
How long does this last?

50:41.100 --> 50:43.100
Up to six hours.

50:45.000 --> 50:49.000
It's a beautiful evening.
Let's sit outside and enjoy nature.

50:54.000 --> 50:56.600
Why don't we huddle
under the awning?

50:56.600 --> 50:59.800
Oh, we can't.
Dad tore it off back in Nevada.

50:59.800 --> 51:02.300
Well, why don't we just
get underneath the umbrella?

51:02.300 --> 51:04.900
Oh, that's right.
Dad fed it to the raccoons.

51:05.200 --> 51:09.200
-Please, try the office again.
-No, he's an idiot.

51:09.300 --> 51:13.100
He won't let us in.
He charged me $70 for these bags.

51:13.100 --> 51:15.500
What about that bar
we passed on the way up here?

51:16.100 --> 51:18.800
-Yeah, Dad, pizza.
-And a roof.

51:18.800 --> 51:22.700
No, it's dark out there. Besides,
those raccoons could be waiting.

51:29.500 --> 51:33.500
Hey! I can see it.
It's just down there.

51:34.000 --> 51:35.600
Come on, I'm starving.

51:36.100 --> 51:38.600
-Bob?
-It's a bad idea.

51:38.600 --> 51:40.200
It's just down the--

51:42.900 --> 51:44.100
Carl!

51:45.800 --> 51:48.100
Carl, we're coming!

51:51.900 --> 51:53.600
Bob!

51:53.600 --> 51:55.200
Mom!

51:58.000 --> 51:59.400
Jamie!

52:02.200 --> 52:03.900
Bob!

52:04.400 --> 52:05.900
Bob!

52:33.400 --> 52:35.700
Table for four. No smoking.

52:36.500 --> 52:38.500
Wipe your feet.

52:43.800 --> 52:45.400
See? That's why you should study.

52:45.400 --> 52:47.900
So you can get good grades
and go to a big party school.

52:49.200 --> 52:52.000
Hey, Dad, how come you never
got a pool table for the house?

52:52.000 --> 52:54.200
Because of the generalissimo
over there.

52:54.200 --> 52:56.800
We had one before you were born,
in the dining room...

52:56.800 --> 52:59.500
...but then you get a job,
invite people for dinner...

52:59.500 --> 53:01.700
-...you have a family....
-Life used to be fun.

53:01.700 --> 53:04.900
It was fun. But then something
happened that was a lot more fun.

53:04.900 --> 53:07.200
We got the George Foreman
smokeless grill.

53:07.200 --> 53:08.500
Okay.

53:16.500 --> 53:19.300
It's fine. Let's just go to sleep.

53:20.900 --> 53:22.600
Oh Dad.

55:46.900 --> 55:48.800
Oh, yeah.

55:53.100 --> 55:56.500
Oh, great, you're up.
Will you make the coffee?

55:56.500 --> 55:59.100
-Love to.
-Thank you.

56:16.500 --> 56:17.900
Do you want me to drive?

56:24.300 --> 56:26.500
-You okay, Dad?
-Oh, yeah.

56:54.200 --> 56:55.500
Dad, emergency!

56:59.600 --> 57:00.300
Gornickes.

57:01.000 --> 57:02.600
I'll get their computer.

57:03.200 --> 57:05.600
I feel like that hitchhiker
in The Twilight Zone.

57:05.600 --> 57:08.400
What do they like about us?
We're not even that appealing.

57:08.400 --> 57:09.900
I'm not gonna spend the rest of my life...

57:09.900 --> 57:12.200
...going door to door,
selling musical car horns.

57:12.200 --> 57:14.300
-Oh the Gornickes. I'll flag them down.
-Cassie!

57:15.900 --> 57:17.000
-Get down!
-What?

57:17.700 --> 57:19.200
She got him.

57:21.600 --> 57:23.400
Munros!

57:24.000 --> 57:25.200
Munros!

57:25.700 --> 57:27.500
Bob! Jamie!

57:27.500 --> 57:29.900
It's the Gornickes.

57:29.900 --> 57:31.900
-Pretend to talk to me.
-Oh, yeah.

57:31.900 --> 57:34.400
Pull over! We've got your stuff!

57:34.400 --> 57:36.800
Munros. It's the Gornickes.

57:40.200 --> 57:43.900
Pull over. We have your computer.

57:44.900 --> 57:48.800
And a Happy Max bag.
Pull over.

57:49.500 --> 57:51.000
Kids, grab your paint guns.

57:51.000 --> 57:53.200
Pull ahead.
We'll put one across their bow.

57:53.200 --> 57:56.400
You know, seeing you drive this thing
is really turning me on.

57:58.100 --> 57:59.500
What?

57:59.500 --> 58:01.000
They've got guns!

58:03.500 --> 58:05.100
We've also got--

58:10.600 --> 58:12.700
You can come up now.

58:12.700 --> 58:14.600
Where did you learn
to drive like that?

58:14.600 --> 58:17.800
How do you think
I get the kids to school on time?

58:20.400 --> 58:23.800
What a shame. If we had their address,
we could just ship it to them.

58:23.800 --> 58:25.600
Well, we do know
where they're headed.

58:25.600 --> 58:28.400
Mount Watson, Colorado.

58:42.700 --> 58:44.700
You know,
if you wore clothes that fit...

58:44.700 --> 58:47.900
-...you wouldn't look like a 10-year-old.
-It's how I roll.

58:54.200 --> 58:55.600
Oh, sweet.

58:55.600 --> 58:57.500
You say something, Frodo?

58:59.100 --> 59:01.400
I was just saying
how that guy Shaq'd you there.

59:01.400 --> 59:04.100
-We got two-on-two, right?
-Why don't you find...

59:04.100 --> 59:05.600
...an under-2-foot league.

59:05.600 --> 59:08.800
Why don't you trade that thing in
on top of your neck for a face.

59:10.200 --> 59:11.900
I'm gonna floss your rear.

59:13.900 --> 59:16.600
-Let's go, bring it. Come on.
-Yo, my mobile homeboys.

59:16.600 --> 59:19.400
-What's tripping in the wood?
-This termite belong to you?

59:19.400 --> 59:21.300
-Don't call--
-Yo, my man-- Easy.

59:21.300 --> 59:23.600
This my man, C.
He's small, but ferocious.

59:23.600 --> 59:26.500
But you dogs, you're hardcore.
Where you from?

59:26.500 --> 59:29.700
-Scottsdale.
-Scottsdale, in the 'Zona.

59:30.000 --> 59:31.600
That's a hardcore 'hood.

59:32.000 --> 59:34.000
But you want to take on
my man C, here...

59:34.000 --> 59:35.700
...go ahead, because, you know...

59:35.700 --> 59:38.100
...he's fierce,
he gonna come up in your face...

59:38.100 --> 59:40.800
...he'll damage you.
You gonna walk away, maybe limp.

59:40.800 --> 59:44.200
But I say talk to the hand, call waiting,
because he's out. Boy is out.

59:44.200 --> 59:47.200
I can't restrains him. Because
I'm conversating you right now...

59:47.200 --> 59:50.800
...to give him a chance to cool down,
to get back to a realistic level...

59:50.800 --> 59:53.400
...as we were. Because we could be
chilling in our crib.

59:53.400 --> 59:56.300
Not just on this mobile home thing,
representing Malibu...

59:56.300 --> 59:58.300
...and Westwood, you know.

59:58.300 --> 01:00:01.100
Malling it, like we all can.
Boys to mensch.

01:00:01.100 --> 01:00:03.300
Pimp my Mercedes, call me back...

01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:05.300
...put you on hold.
You know what I'm saying?

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:08.700
We gotta go.

01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:12.600
You better, man. Don't make me
call my lawyer, because I'll audit.

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:15.400
Aren't you glad Dad came?
They were about to kick your butt.

01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:18.200
Carl.
That's not helpful. Carl.

01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:20.600
Carl.

01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:23.200
It occurs to me that you and I
haven't had too many...

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:26.000
...7th Heaven kind of dialogues
in the last year.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:29.100
-You're busy a Lot.
-Yeah, but not too busy to notice...

01:00:29.100 --> 01:00:31.800
...that you are sensitive
about your size.

01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:35.500
I'll bet you $1000 right now
you'll grow up bigger than me.

01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:38.400
I've seen pictures of you when you
were my age. You were huge.

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:41.900
-You were shaving already.
-Yeah, well, that's my point.

01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:43.600
See, I achieved maturity very early.

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:46.000
I stopped growing
after the eighth grade.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:49.300
But you have the other body type.
You're like my friend John Vigoshi.

01:00:49.300 --> 01:00:52.300
When he was 16,
he had a 9-inch summer.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:54.500
How do you mean that?

01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:57.500
He grew very tall, very quickly,
and so will you.

01:00:57.500 --> 01:01:00.200
And you're being proactive.
You're lifting weights.

01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:02.500
And when you grow up big,
you know what we'll do?

01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:03.900
What?

01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:06.500
We'll enter father-son
extreme-fighting competitions.

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:08.800
-All right.
-You'll have to push the wheelchair.

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:11.000
But we'll get them high,
and we'll get them low.

01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:17.800
Coming at you a little heat right now.

01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:21.600
Give me a little heat there.
A little heat. A little pepper there.

01:01:21.600 --> 01:01:23.200
Hike! All right.

01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:31.100
What's up?

01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:36.700
Kids, dinner's gonna be a little late
because--

01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:40.400
Sorry. False alarm.

01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:45.200
-The buzzing is not me.
-Bob.

01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:50.000
-Hello.
-Before you hang up on me again...

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.100
...we need to talk.

01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:53.400
I'm sorry, I can't hear you very well.

01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:55.600
Signal. No, no. Yeah.

01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:57.200
Hold on one second. The signal.

01:01:57.800 --> 01:02:00.900
Just a-- Can you hear me now?

01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:04.800
-Hey, Todd. Did you get the proposal?
-Not bad.

01:02:05.100 --> 01:02:06.800
My Laird didn't like it very much.

01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:09.800
-Who cares what Laird thinks.
-I do. He's young, Bob.

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:11.800
We'll talk about it tonight
on the plane.

01:02:11.800 --> 01:02:13.300
-No.
-No?

01:02:13.300 --> 01:02:17.300
I flew in last night. It's a mile high here
and I want to get acclimated.

01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:19.700
You don't wanna have a nose bleed
in a presentation.

01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:21.300
Could be a little embarrassing.

01:02:21.300 --> 01:02:24.700
So I'll see you there. Here.

01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:34.600
Mom, he's suffering.

01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:36.400
Honey, can I help?

01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:40.000
No, honey.
No, don't come down here.

01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.200
Boy, I'm just gonna try
and clean up a little--

01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:44.900
Don't use bark.

01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:47.000
These are great.

01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:49.600
Yeah, there it is. That does the trick.

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:52.900
Ferns. Nature's broom.

01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:56.000
Honey, no. You can't go on like this.
It's 10 miles.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.900
No,
I don't wanna spoil it for you guys.

01:02:57.900 --> 01:03:01.200
-You won't. We'll go tomorrow.
-No.

01:03:01.200 --> 01:03:02.700
Tomorrow we go to the lake.

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:05.500
Listen, I'll stay here. You go on.

01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:08.700
-I don't know--
-Go. It's a beautiful hike.

01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:11.100
Guys?

01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:13.200
Come on, kids.

01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:16.500
Yeah? Okay.

01:03:16.500 --> 01:03:18.000
Good.

01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:21.200
I'll try and make it back to the RV.

01:03:21.200 --> 01:03:23.200
I'm okay. Got my ferns.

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:25.800
Okay. I'm okay.

01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:30.200
Go on. Go on, you guys.
Save yourself. Okay.

01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:56.300
Welcome to the Road Mate 700.

01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:59.700
Hi, Lola. My wife's not here.

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:33.000
-The hell are you driving?
-Cadillac of RVs, Todd.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.600
You know, we should go over-- Laird.

01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:38.400
Yeah, I decided
to go with Laird's presentation.

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:42.000
-But hang around, tell a few jokes.
-You got it.

01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:50.900
Hi there.

01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:53.100
-Larry Moiphine.
-Garry Moiphine.

01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:56.200
-Cute dog.
-Oh, yeah. She's a sweetie.

01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:59.100
Oh, yeah, who's a good girl?

01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:00.500
-Todd?
-No.

01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:02.100
-Bob.
-Hi, Bob.

01:05:02.100 --> 01:05:03.500
-Laird.
-Hi, Laird.

01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:04.900
Larry. Laird.

01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:08.200
So, fellas, we'll have a little nosh
and we'll hear your presentation.

01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:10.900
-Tammy's not here yet. Our assistant.
-So we'll eat slow.

01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:12.500
-Come on.
-Gentlemen.

01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:26.700
Oh, hi. Hi. Sorry I'm late.

01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:29.400
You guys have all just got to see
the circus before it leaves.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:31.600
-It's good, huh?
-It was amazing.

01:05:31.600 --> 01:05:33.200
Wow, so....

01:05:33.200 --> 01:05:38.000
Oh, of course. I believe you folks
have a presentation for us.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:43.200
-Yes. Laird.
-Good luck.

01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:54.100
In 1985, Pure Vibe soda completed
a friendly takeover...

01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:56.900
...of Mr. Twinkle Iced Tea.
Today, Mr. Twinkle is worth...

01:05:56.900 --> 01:05:59.300
...an estimated $91 million.

01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:02.900
And that was with a profit definition
not as favorable...

01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:05.700
...as the one Pure Vibe is offering...

01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:09.200
...Alpine Soda.
If you turn to chart number one--

01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:11.600
Sorry, is this just gonna be
about money?

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:13.100
No, it's-- Stocks.

01:06:13.100 --> 01:06:15.800
Other than money,
why should we change from a local...

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:19.200
...family-oriented business to become
subsidiary to a national brand?

01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:22.700
Yeah. Other than money?

01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:25.200
-Right.
-Yeah.

01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:27.200
Garry, Larry.

01:06:28.100 --> 01:06:31.600
Fifty years ago, if you walked down
any street in America...

01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:35.400
...on a warm Monday night--
Thanks, Laird.

01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:39.300
--you'd hear I love Lucy coming out
of every house, on every block.

01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:42.700
I'm not speaking about conformity,
I'm talking about "Isn't it great?"

01:06:42.700 --> 01:06:44.100
And every once in a while...

01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:46.500
...America falls in love with something
together.

01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:49.100
That could happen here.
You have a terrific product.

01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:51.600
Money aside, how'd
Walter Frederick Morrison feel...

01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:54.300
...every time he walked by a park
and he'd see people...

01:06:54.300 --> 01:06:56.800
...throwing a Frisbee and the dog
doing all the work?

01:06:56.800 --> 01:07:00.000
If Pure Vibe takes Alpine national,
I think we have a chance...

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:03.500
...to let America fall in love
with something again.

01:07:05.300 --> 01:07:08.200
What's your hurry? Why don't
you stay and bask in my gratitude?

01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:10.300
I gotta get the RV back right now,
Todd...

01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:12.200
...or I have to pay for a full day.

01:07:12.700 --> 01:07:16.300
-Well, just picture me hugging you.
-Thanks.

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:30.300
Officer? Excuse me.
What's going on?

01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:32.400
Landslide.
We're diverting through I-70.

01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:35.900
I-70? It'll take hours. Isn't there
another way around Mount Watson?

01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:38.300
Diablo Pass. But you're not
gonna make it in that rig.

01:08:28.500 --> 01:08:30.899
Dad was right.
This is really amazing.

01:08:30.899 --> 01:08:33.800
Yeah. Poor Dad.

01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:35.899
Should we cut this short
and go back?

01:08:35.899 --> 01:08:38.200
-Yeah.
-Okay.

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:43.100
You are not on any marked road.

01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:44.500
I know that, Lola.

01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:47.300
Make a U-turn
at the next legal opportunity.

01:08:47.300 --> 01:08:48.700
I can't.

01:09:01.399 --> 01:09:03.300
Squeeze them cheeks
Tighten them buns

01:09:03.300 --> 01:09:05.200
Come on now
We having fun

01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:09.200
Big old rolling turd coming through
Coming through

01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:19.300
- You are not on any marked road.
-Shut up!

01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:37.300
Come on, Turd. Keep rolling.
Come on. Come on.

01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:39.300
You can do it.

01:09:40.899 --> 01:09:42.200
Come on.

01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:50.200
Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:10:11.100 --> 01:10:12.400
Damn it.

01:11:57.200 --> 01:11:59.900
Make a U-turn
at the next legal opportunity.

01:12:02.100 --> 01:12:04.300
Dad's gonna be surprised
we got back so soon.

01:12:04.300 --> 01:12:05.700
Yeah.

01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:22.300
Who was that maniac?

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.100
Oh, God.

01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:50.900
Bob?

01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:55.700
-Jamie.
-Why are you laying on the ground?

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.300
Honey,
there's something I need to tell you.

01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:02.700
I need....

01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:06.400
Needed a....

01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:10.300
Needed a little fresh air.

01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.800
After my incident.

01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:14.200
And how are you now?

01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:16.400
Good.

01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:19.900
Really good. Good.

01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:21.800
Oh, yeah.

01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:28.500
-Hello?
-Bob? Bob-orino? Bobcat?

01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:31.800
-Yeah?
-Teeny tiny wrinkle-dinkle.

01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:33.800
Larry wants you
to come back tomorrow...

01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:36.200
...and pitch the whole company,
all the employees.

01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:38.200
Majority want the merger,
it's a done deal.

01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:39.600
-What?
-We don't need him.

01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:43.400
I can do this. Give me another chance.
Let me kick this through the uprights!

01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:48.600
-I'll do it. I'm there.
-Great. You're spitting on me.

01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:56.300
Big old rolling turd coming through
Coming through

01:13:56.300 --> 01:14:00.300
Oh, we're on that road
On a big, steaming load

01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:04.000
Big old rolling turd coming through
Coming through

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Big old rolling turd
Big old rolling turd coming through

01:14:14.100 --> 01:14:17.500
Hey, Dad. Maybe we can go
to Yellowstone on the way home.

01:14:17.500 --> 01:14:21.200
-I'd love to go to Yellowstone.
-Yeah, Dad. Can we?

01:14:21.200 --> 01:14:22.800
Absolutely.

01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:25.600
Come on. I wanna show you
something wonderful.

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:33.800
It's hard to forget this place.

01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:35.700
My dad was so moved by it
he said:

01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:38.800
"You know, a snack stand up here
would do tremendous."

01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:43.100
My mom, always supportive:
"And who's gonna run it, Allan, you?"

01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:47.700
My dad: "Why don't you blow it out
your big, saggy rear end, Ellen."

01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:49.700
Can't buy memories like that.

01:14:49.700 --> 01:14:51.700
Or like this.

01:14:52.500 --> 01:14:56.200
Hey. You know, I should take the RV
to get the emergency brake fixed...

01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:58.600
-...before we head to L.A.
-Yeah. Good idea.

01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:01.400
And you guys don't want
to hang around some dingy garage.

01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:03.500
You wait here by the lake,
enjoy the view.

01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:06.700
I'll drive to Boulder, be back
in an hour. We'll have a big picnic.

01:15:06.700 --> 01:15:09.500
-How about that?
-Okay. Sounds good.

01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:13.400
Guys? Tell your dad
what you wanted to tell him.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:17.200
-Thank you for taking us on this trip.
-Kinko that.

01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:21.500
-Better than Hawaii?
-Yeah, better than Hawaii.

01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:24.100
Come give big daddy a hug.
Come on.

01:15:24.100 --> 01:15:26.900
-Wait.
-Carl, you'll be too big soon.

01:15:26.900 --> 01:15:28.500
-Dad.
-Cassie'll be in college.

01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:29.700
-Dad!
-What?

01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:31.600
The RV's rolling away.

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:36.500
No!

01:15:36.500 --> 01:15:37.700
Oh, God, no.

01:15:37.700 --> 01:15:39.000
-Oh, no!
-Dad, let it go!

01:15:40.700 --> 01:15:43.800
Bob. Bob!

01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.400
-Bob!
-Mom, what are you doing?

01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:51.700
Bob, no!

01:15:56.200 --> 01:15:58.000
Go.

01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.300
Are you crazy? It's a rental.

01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:05.600
-How am I gonna get to the meeting?
-What meeting?

01:16:05.600 --> 01:16:07.400
The Alpine merger.

01:16:09.300 --> 01:16:11.900
Sweetheart, you'll never guess
what happened yesterday.

01:16:11.900 --> 01:16:14.500
-You weren't really sick.
-Not really.

01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:16.400
This is about work.

01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:19.200
You brought us out here because
it was close to a meeting?

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:21.800
-You're getting warmer.
-The Alpine soda merger.

01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:24.700
-Bingo.
-So you lied to me...

01:16:24.700 --> 01:16:28.000
-...from the very beginning.
-Since we were first married?

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.700
No, since when you
first brought home the RV.

01:16:31.700 --> 01:16:33.900
-That time, yeah.
-This has nothing to do...

01:16:33.900 --> 01:16:36.000
...with you wanting to be
with your family.

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:38.600
-So you just used us?
-You wouldn't understand, missy.

01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:40.400
Oh, I don't know, she's pretty smart.

01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:42.500
Why don't you explain it to her.
And Carl too.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.400
Kids...

01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:45.800
...life is hard.

01:16:45.800 --> 01:16:48.200
Not "The TiVo in my room
is not working" hard.

01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:51.700
But "making a living because you're
responsible for people you love" hard.

01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:54.600
You know what it's like to be 50,
people are digging a hole...

01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:56.100
-...to bury your career--
-Bob.

01:16:56.100 --> 01:16:57.700
All right, that's a little rough.

01:16:57.700 --> 01:16:59.800
Cassie,
where do you want to go to college?

01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:01.800
Stanford.

01:17:01.800 --> 01:17:03.700
Carl, where's that camp you're going?

01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:05.900
-Alaska.
-Alaska.

01:17:05.900 --> 01:17:09.300
And you, how much do you think
that little fixer-upper of ours cost?

01:17:09.300 --> 01:17:11.700
Who has to ride a $4000 bicycle?

01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:14.800
I have to ride a custom bike
because my hips aren't aligned.

01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:18.300
Are you happy? Now the kids know
that their old man's a freak.

01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:22.100
Listen, I have to get to that meeting,
or I lose my job and we Lose a lifestyle.

01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:24.200
Let's pull it up two-by-two,
Look for help.

01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:26.200
-Carl. Come with me.
-I'm good.

01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:29.500
Cassie?

01:18:27.100 --> 01:18:30.500
I'm gonna Lose my job. I hope the kids
like selling fruit on the freeway.

01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:38.100
You know what's scary
is that this is rush hour.

01:18:38.100 --> 01:18:42.100
Mom, there's never going to be
any other cars on this road.

01:18:47.300 --> 01:18:50.000
Oh, my God.

01:18:53.700 --> 01:18:55.800
-Where's your husband?
-Don't ask.

01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:58.100
Could you possibly
take us to an airport?

01:18:59.100 --> 01:19:00.600
What's all this?

01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:03.000
Oh, I gotta study
for my stupid placement test.

01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:06.000
Oh, like some sort of
vocational training?

01:19:07.500 --> 01:19:08.700
College.

01:19:09.700 --> 01:19:13.000
-How old are you?
-Fifteen and a half. I jumped a grade.

01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:15.600
Moon, though,
she skipped two grades.

01:19:16.300 --> 01:19:18.200
So...

01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:20.600
...you guys are smart.

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:23.800
Gonna be unemployed.

01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:26.600
I'm gonna have to sell my liver
for cash.

01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:30.200
And then he just
rode out of the lake.

01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:33.700
Yup. This one really snuck up
and bit me right on the seat-meat.

01:19:33.700 --> 01:19:35.700
I thought Bob was good people.

01:19:35.700 --> 01:19:38.300
-Does anybody have a vomit bag?
-Are you sick?

01:19:38.300 --> 01:19:41.300
Big time.
Cassie and Earl are making out.

01:19:41.300 --> 01:19:42.500
What?

01:19:42.500 --> 01:19:44.400
Don't worry.
I got them in the mirror.

01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:46.300
Boy don't know
what the hell he's doing.

01:19:46.300 --> 01:19:49.200
-Like father, like son.
-Hey.

01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:51.300
Listen, I have to admit something.

01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:54.900
Bob wasn't the only one
trying to avoid you. I was too.

01:19:54.900 --> 01:19:58.100
I don't mean to shock you, but we
ain't everybody's cup of sunshine.

01:19:58.100 --> 01:20:00.300
Well, it was you,
but it was mostly us.

01:20:00.300 --> 01:20:02.700
You didn't exactly catch
the Munros at their best.

01:20:02.700 --> 01:20:05.200
Yeah, see, I had a feeling
you was having troubles.

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:07.300
Yeah, here's the thing.

01:20:07.300 --> 01:20:09.900
You start off happy and stupid.

01:20:09.900 --> 01:20:12.200
Then you become associates
in the marriage business:

01:20:12.700 --> 01:20:14.900
"Did the plumber come?"
"Take Carl to soccer."

01:20:14.900 --> 01:20:17.200
"I'll pick up your dad
from the doctor's office."

01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:20.500
Until you don't remember what
brought you together in the first place.

01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:22.800
You know what I mean?

01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:24.700
No, I don't. I-- No.

01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:25.900
No.

01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:28.700
Okay.

01:20:28.700 --> 01:20:33.800
Anyway, in the last few days,
I caught a glimpse of the old us.

01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:36.200
And I was happy.

01:20:37.700 --> 01:20:39.100
I better get directions...

01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:41.800
...so I can take you folks
where you need to be.

01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:06.200
Oh, really?

01:21:09.600 --> 01:21:11.300
Jamie!

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:15.200
Cassie! Carl!

01:21:15.200 --> 01:21:17.400
Come on, let's hit the road, Jamie.

01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:20.700
Okay.

01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:24.900
Oh, God.

01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:34.400
-Ladies first.
-Oh, boy, that's working it.

01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:00.700
Stop!

01:22:01.700 --> 01:22:04.200
Oh, Munro!

01:22:04.200 --> 01:22:05.600
The hike was so intense...

01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:08.600
...there was a few parts where
I had to carry my mom and sister.

01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:10.900
I think I might have pulled a muscle.

01:22:10.900 --> 01:22:12.900
-Where?
-In the woods.

01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:18.300
Travis!

01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:13.100
Jamie.

01:23:15.300 --> 01:23:16.700
Bob?

01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:24.100
Are you an idiot? Do you want
your children to see their father...

01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:25.600
...bouncing down the highway?

01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:27.500
Why are you with
the Partridge Family?

01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:30.300
-What are you doing on the bus?
-Because I was chasing you.

01:23:30.300 --> 01:23:33.700
You win. I blew off my job because
I can't live without you. You happy?

01:23:33.700 --> 01:23:37.400
I never asked you to blow off your job.
I wanted you to be honest with me.

01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:40.300
Honest. Like, "Todd's gonna fire me
if I go to Boulder" honest?

01:23:40.300 --> 01:23:43.600
-"Screw Hawaii" honest?
-Oh, I see.

01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:46.400
You think that if you told me
you were in trouble...

01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:49.800
...and your job was in jeopardy,
that I'd give you a hard time about it?

01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:51.200
No crying, that's cheating.

01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:54.300
Do you think I'm some horrible witch
that doesn't care? I do care!

01:23:54.300 --> 01:23:56.100
I care a lot.

01:23:56.100 --> 01:23:59.200
In fact, I hate you. Jerk.

01:24:00.300 --> 01:24:03.100
I didn't want you to know
I was in trouble.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:07.500
You and Cassie and Carl,
you mean everything to me.

01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:11.100
What you think about me is the
most important thing in the world.

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:14.200
I didn't want to fail.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:19.700
If you don't know how I feel about you
after 19 years of marriage...

01:24:19.700 --> 01:24:22.100
...then I must be a failure as a wife.

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.300
Then you admit you're the problem.

01:24:27.900 --> 01:24:29.600
Bob.

01:24:36.100 --> 01:24:39.400
You mean more to me
than just a paycheck.

01:24:39.900 --> 01:24:42.700
That's good, because we won't be
getting one for a while.

01:24:42.700 --> 01:24:44.300
I missed that meeting.

01:24:44.300 --> 01:24:45.900
No, you didn't.

01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:49.500
Come on, Bob. Come here.

01:25:03.300 --> 01:25:05.600
It's a Christmas miracle.

01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:08.600
No, it just sounded like this was
where your wife needed to be.

01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:10.600
So I brought her.

01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:14.200
Travis has never been one
to mind his own business.

01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:16.100
Travis...

01:25:16.100 --> 01:25:21.100
...some of my behavior on this trip
might be misconstrued as an insult.

01:25:21.100 --> 01:25:23.700
Did come off a tad abrasive.

01:25:23.700 --> 01:25:26.500
I was wrong, and it takes
a small man to admit it.

01:25:26.500 --> 01:25:27.900
And you're a big man.

01:25:27.900 --> 01:25:31.000
-I don't just mean--
-I understand a metaphor, Bob.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:32.900
See, I went to Stanford.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.200
You big lug, I love you!

01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:39.900
Who loves his big Lug?

01:25:39.900 --> 01:25:42.200
-I love you, you big--
-I know, I--

01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:45.200
-Todd.
-Little dramatic, don't you think, Bob?

01:25:45.200 --> 01:25:46.900
Showing up at
the last possible minute.

01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:49.600
You look horrible. Let's go.

01:25:55.900 --> 01:25:57.400
Dad.

01:25:57.700 --> 01:25:59.200
-I'm sorry.
-Sorry?

01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:03.200
I guess you're under a lot of pressure
and I could have been less trouble.

01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:05.400
And in your own nerdy way
you're kind of cool.

01:26:07.300 --> 01:26:09.200
-Bob?
-Yeah?

01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:10.800
I'm hating this.

01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:15.400
-Dad.
-Yeah?

01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:16.900
-I get it.
-What?

01:26:16.900 --> 01:26:19.900
Sometimes if you wanna succeed,
you have to do what they tell you.

01:26:26.300 --> 01:26:28.000
-You--
-Bob!

01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:34.100
This is the big one, Bobcat.

01:26:34.100 --> 01:26:35.700
-Bases loaded.
-Got it.

01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:38.700
You hit a grand slam on this,
it's big raise, promotion, bonus...

01:26:38.700 --> 01:26:41.400
...and I personally push Laird
down a flight of stairs.

01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:44.700
Everybody, this is Bob.
Remember, charming and funny.

01:26:45.100 --> 01:26:47.600
Hi, everybody. Sorry I'm late...

01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:51.200
...I just came down that mountain,
and next time I'll use a road.

01:26:51.900 --> 01:26:55.200
I guess you guys didn't get the memo
about extreme casual.

01:26:56.100 --> 01:26:59.000
I love your wilderness so much,
I decided to wear it.

01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:02.300
Easy, Todd.

01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.200
It's been kind of a wild journey
getting here.

01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:07.700
If you ever wanna really find out
about yourself...

01:27:07.700 --> 01:27:10.000
...put your family in an RV and drive.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:11.700
I've seen some amazing stuff.

01:27:11.700 --> 01:27:15.600
I've fought wild raccoons and won.
I've been in the desert to a place...

01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:19.100
...where it's not the end of the world,
but you can see it from there.

01:27:19.100 --> 01:27:21.500
And I met this weird family.

01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:24.400
I mean, boy, they were strange.

01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:27.500
You know, whenever a big white man
picks up a banjo, my cheeks tighten.

01:27:28.100 --> 01:27:31.200
In the dictionary, under "hootenanny,"
it says, "See: them."

01:27:31.200 --> 01:27:33.600
But you know
what's strange about them.

01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:38.500
They're just honest, good people, and
it's an honor to have them as friends.

01:27:41.700 --> 01:27:43.300
Garry, Larry...

01:27:43.300 --> 01:27:46.200
...this is a nice company
you have here. It's your baby.

01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:49.200
I bet at the birth of your baby
you were kind of scared, right?

01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:52.200
Excited, but scared. You didn't
know how it was gonna turn out.

01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:54.700
And next thing you know,
it's up and walking...

01:27:54.700 --> 01:27:58.100
...and you're trying to raise it. You
didn't know what you were doing...

01:27:58.100 --> 01:28:00.100
...but you pretended like you did.

01:28:00.100 --> 01:28:03.000
And next thing you know,
your baby's grown.

01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:06.600
It's bigger, older. More complicated.

01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:07.900
Difficult to deal with.

01:28:09.100 --> 01:28:11.300
But here's the deal...

01:28:11.300 --> 01:28:15.200
...you care about it just as much,
because you nurtured it...

01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:18.600
...and part of you is in it,
and you're proud of it.

01:28:19.300 --> 01:28:20.900
You love it more than ever.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.500
And right now,
you have to make a decision...

01:28:28.500 --> 01:28:31.700
...of whether you wanna merge
your family with the Pure Vibe family.

01:28:31.700 --> 01:28:34.400
Your stocks are gonna split.
You're gonna have money...

01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:37.500
...you won't know what to do with.
And your company's gonna grow.

01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:40.600
You'll be bigger than a woman
in bicycle shorts at Disneyland.

01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:44.400
You'll be able to get all that stuff,
like the ski boat, a $4000 bike...

01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:46.000
...maybe even a Barcalounger...

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:48.900
...that massages your ass
and blows smoke at the same time.

01:28:48.900 --> 01:28:50.600
Bottom line here, Garry, Larry.

01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:53.400
If you wanna merge
Alpine and Pure Vibe...

01:28:54.200 --> 01:28:57.600
...I promise you, you're making
the worst decision of your entire life.

01:28:59.300 --> 01:29:02.400
This guy is a disgruntled employee.

01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:05.700
Couldn't keep up with younger talent.
Look at him. He's off his meds.

01:29:05.700 --> 01:29:08.400
Finished. His own daughter
assaulted me in my home.

01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:11.400
I did not. It was my friend,
and she did it because Pure Vibe...

01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:14.200
...has one of the worst
environmental records in the industry.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.400
Why are these kids here?

01:29:16.400 --> 01:29:19.900
Plus, last year you guys outsourced
for cheaper labor to other countries--

01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:22.600
Let her go, Todd.

01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:24.700
I'll let her go. I'll let you go.

01:29:24.700 --> 01:29:26.300
You're fired.

01:29:31.300 --> 01:29:33.000
Yo, dog.

01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:36.800
-Carl.
-My hero.

01:29:39.800 --> 01:29:42.300
Todd, I quit.

01:30:06.700 --> 01:30:08.800
Honey,
there seems to be snow on the ground.

01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:11.700
Babe, it's left over from last winter.
At 9500 feet...

01:30:11.700 --> 01:30:13.200
...it doesn't melt. It's glacial.

01:30:14.500 --> 01:30:16.500
-We don't have chains.
-Don't need them.

01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:18.300
They're for the winter, not July.

01:30:18.300 --> 01:30:20.300
Well, I see snow.

01:30:20.300 --> 01:30:21.800
Hey, Dad, are we poor?

01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:24.800
Carl, there's a lot of ways
to measure a family's wealth.

01:30:24.800 --> 01:30:27.100
-I think love--
-I was talking about money.

01:30:27.100 --> 01:30:29.000
-We're dirt poor.
-Sell the house.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.100
We could all live
in the Big Rolling Turd.

01:30:31.100 --> 01:30:34.000
We'll spend every minute together,
just like the Gornickes.

01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:37.400
-That just sounds fantastic.
-Oh, yeah.

01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:43.700
-Chains. Four-wheel drive.
-Thanks.

01:30:45.000 --> 01:30:48.400
Officer, good day. I know what you're
gonna say: "Where are your chains?"

01:30:48.400 --> 01:30:50.900
Well, sir, this is no ordinary RV.

01:30:50.900 --> 01:30:54.200
It's part ATV, part SUV,
and certified by the DMV.

01:30:54.200 --> 01:30:57.900
It's got positraction, Dynaflow,
control traction with me in control.

01:30:57.900 --> 01:31:00.400
It's got heated rims.
Wish I had those.

01:31:03.600 --> 01:31:05.100
Okay.

01:31:05.100 --> 01:31:07.700
License and registration, sir.

01:31:16.300 --> 01:31:18.200
Oh, there it is.

01:31:20.900 --> 01:31:23.400
I believe that was
the rental agreement.

01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:26.200
We had a little bit
of a mishap at the lake.

01:31:26.200 --> 01:31:29.300
I lost my wallet.
My name is Bob Munro.

01:31:30.500 --> 01:31:32.500
We got him.
We're just ahead of you.

01:31:33.100 --> 01:31:34.300
Got me?

01:31:35.300 --> 01:31:38.500
Officer, I know she may look unsafe,
but she's tough.

01:31:38.500 --> 01:31:40.500
She likes to be rode hard
and put away wet.

01:31:40.500 --> 01:31:42.800
Spent two days in the lake.
Had to fish her out.

01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:44.700
It means a lot.
We couldn't abandon it.

01:31:44.700 --> 01:31:46.200
It's like a big, ugly pet, really.

01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:49.700
You got him. Thanks, Sam.

01:31:49.700 --> 01:31:52.200
-We owe you one.
-We've been chasing you all morning.

01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:53.700
I just took one soda.

01:31:53.700 --> 01:31:56.200
No, we just want you to know
we're going national.

01:31:57.100 --> 01:31:59.300
-Well, good luck.
-With you.

01:31:59.300 --> 01:32:01.600
We want you to join us
at Alpine Beverages.

01:32:02.300 --> 01:32:04.900
-You're offering me a job?
-Yeah.

01:32:04.900 --> 01:32:08.300
