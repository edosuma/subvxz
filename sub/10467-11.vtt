Ned on Machine:
JULIA, IT'S ME.

00:04.569 --> 00:06.963
YOU CAN'T JUST KEEP
NOT ANSWERING MY MESSAGES.

00:06.963 --> 00:08.530
I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY
TIMES THIS MAKES,

00:08.530 --> 00:09.618
BUT I'LL SAY IT AGAIN,

00:09.618 --> 00:10.836
I'M SORRY.

00:10.836 --> 00:12.273
I'M SORRY
WE HAD A FIGHT,

00:12.273 --> 00:14.753
BUT YOU KNOW,
PEOPLE FIGHT.

00:14.753 --> 00:17.234
IF I WASN'T
SO TOTALLY CRAZED

00:17.234 --> 00:19.628
THINKING ABOUT YOU
EVERY SECOND...

00:19.628 --> 00:22.109
LOOK, LOOK, PICK UP.

00:22.109 --> 00:24.763

00:24.763 --> 00:26.939
YOU'VE GOT TO BE.
I'M COMING OVER.

00:29.681 --> 00:31.727
GREETINGS, O JULIA.

00:31.727 --> 00:34.251
JUST HAD
PROFESSOR SHAPIRO'S
SHAKESPEARE.

00:34.251 --> 00:35.992
DON'T YOU HATE
WHEN TEACHERS,

00:35.992 --> 00:38.038
LIKE, DO THE PARTS?

00:38.038 --> 00:40.170
HE GOT REALLY INTO
OPHELIA.

00:40.170 --> 00:41.693
HEY, WHAT'D YOU
JUST ERASE?

00:41.693 --> 00:43.782
OH, DON'T WORRY.
IT WASN'T FOR YOU.

00:45.175 --> 00:47.525
IS YOUR ARM
STILL HURTING YOU?

00:47.525 --> 00:49.005
YOU KNOW WHAT, MAGGIE?

00:49.005 --> 00:51.399
I'M GOING HOME
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.

00:51.399 --> 00:53.705
YOU'RE GOING TO MISS
THE FINALS REVIEW

00:53.705 --> 00:55.664
SO IF ANYONE ASKS...

00:55.664 --> 00:57.057

00:57.057 --> 00:59.450

00:59.450 --> 01:01.757
SO YOU DON'T KNOW
WHERE I'VE GONE, OK?

01:03.759 --> 01:05.674
SURE, OF COURSE.

01:05.674 --> 01:08.111

TO TELL HIM,
I WON'T.

01:08.111 --> 01:10.200
THANKS.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.680
JUST LIKE
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK TO ME

01:11.680 --> 01:12.942
ABOUT WHAT'S
GOING ON,

YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

01:15.988 --> 01:18.469
WITH YOU AND NED,
I MEAN.

01:20.515 --> 01:22.125
I CAN'T.

01:22.125 --> 01:23.909

BEING THAT SMALL?

02:11.522 --> 02:13.655
YEAH.

02:13.655 --> 02:15.352
I MEAN, NO.
NOT--NOT THAT SMALL.

02:15.352 --> 02:16.658
NEITHER CAN YOU.
YOU WEREN'T EVEN

02:16.658 --> 02:17.659
THAT SMALL
WHEN YOU WERE BORN.

02:17.659 --> 02:19.617
YOU REMEMBER?

02:19.617 --> 02:21.576
GOD YEAH.

02:21.576 --> 02:22.751
I WAS IN
HIGH SCHOOL.

02:22.751 --> 02:24.013
I GAVE UP
A WHOLE WEEKEND,

02:24.013 --> 02:25.754
HAD 49ers TICKETS
AND EVERYTHING,

02:25.754 --> 02:27.669
TO BABYSIT BAILEY
AND JULIA,

02:27.669 --> 02:29.236
'CAUSE DAD
HAD TO KEEP RUNNING

02:29.236 --> 02:31.020
BACK AND FORTH
TO THE HOSPITAL.

02:31.020 --> 02:34.502
BAILEY WAS ABOUT 5.

02:34.502 --> 02:38.375
HE WAS THE ULTIMATE,
ULTIMATE BRAT
TO BABYSIT.

02:38.375 --> 02:41.726
HA HA. WHAT ARE YOU
DOING WITH THOSE BOXES?

02:41.726 --> 02:43.250
JUST PUTTING
THEM HERE FOR NOW.

02:43.250 --> 02:44.381
DAPHNE LEFT A BUNCH
OF STUFF IN HERE.

02:44.381 --> 02:46.166
I'VE GOT TO PACK
IT UP LATER.

02:46.166 --> 02:47.645
I WANT IT
TO BE READY

02:47.645 --> 02:49.473
WHEN SHE SENDS
FOR IT ALL.

02:49.473 --> 02:51.910
WELL, HOW DO YOU KNOW?

02:51.910 --> 02:54.217
THAT SHE ISN'T JUST
COMING BACK, I MEAN.

02:54.217 --> 02:56.524
CLAUD, THAT'S--
THAT'S WAY OVER,

02:56.524 --> 02:59.048
ME AND DAPHNE.
END OF STORY.

02:59.048 --> 03:01.137
YOU KNOW WHAT?
LET ME PACK UP
HER THINGS FOR YOU.

03:01.137 --> 03:02.747
IT'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING
THAT YOU HATE DOING.

03:02.747 --> 03:04.662
CLAUD, UH,
THANKS,

03:04.662 --> 03:06.447
BUT, YOU KNOW,
IT'S REALLY NOT
A BIG JOB,

03:06.447 --> 03:08.927
AND I DON'T NEED
ANY HELP.

03:13.628 --> 03:16.674
DO YOU THINK DIANA
KNOWS SOMETHING'S
HAPPENED TO HER?

03:16.674 --> 03:18.894
THAT HER MOTHER'S LEFT,
AND--

03:18.894 --> 03:20.809
PROBABLY ISN'T
A GREAT QUESTION

03:20.809 --> 03:23.420
TO BE ASKING
RIGHT NOW, HUH?

03:23.420 --> 03:25.901
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT IT.

03:25.901 --> 03:29.252
I DON'T THINK
SHE REALIZES.

03:29.252 --> 03:33.300
I MEAN,
IT'S BEEN A WEEK,
AND SHE SEEMS OK.

03:33.300 --> 03:35.258
HEY, HOW LONG YOU
GOING TO HANG OUT?

03:35.258 --> 03:36.433
DON'T YOU HAVE
TO GET TO SCHOOL?

03:36.433 --> 03:37.565
[DIANA FUSSES]

03:37.565 --> 03:39.523
OK, OK, OK.
ALL RIGHT. FINE.

03:39.523 --> 03:41.569
OK, BYE, DI.

03:46.965 --> 03:49.838
SHH. SHH. SHH.

04:04.026 --> 04:05.897
OH, HEY.

04:05.897 --> 04:07.812
OW. HI.

04:07.812 --> 04:10.815
HEY. HERE, LET ME
GET THOSE FOR YOU.

04:10.815 --> 04:12.513
DID YOU PULL
YOUR SHOULDER
OR SOMETHING?

04:12.513 --> 04:14.210
NO, I MEAN, YEAH,
BUT, UH--

04:14.210 --> 04:15.603
REALLY? HOW?

04:15.603 --> 04:16.995
I HAD AN ACCIDENT

04:16.995 --> 04:18.736
ON THAT SERVICE ROAD
BEHIND THE DORM--

04:18.736 --> 04:20.172
LET ME SEE.
SOMETHING HAPPEN
TO THE CAR?

04:20.172 --> 04:21.783
NO, GRIFFIN, DON'T.
FORGET IT.

04:21.783 --> 04:24.264
WHY? I'VE WORKED
ON THE OLD BEAST
A MILLION TIMES.

04:24.264 --> 04:25.961
IT DIDN'T--YOU CAN'T
EVEN SEE IT.

04:25.961 --> 04:26.962
IS IT FRONT OR BACK?

04:26.962 --> 04:28.268
GRIFFIN,
WOULD YOU STOP--

04:28.268 --> 04:30.052
STOP TRYING TO HELP
WITH EVERYTHING.

04:30.052 --> 04:32.010
WELL, THAT'S NOT EASY.

04:32.010 --> 04:33.273
JULIA, HEY.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.362
HEY YOU.

04:35.362 --> 04:36.711
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HOME?

04:36.711 --> 04:38.887
OH, I WAS, UM,
JUST MISSING EVERYBODY.

04:38.887 --> 04:41.193
WHERE'S NED?

04:41.193 --> 04:42.499
I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT HIM, OK?

04:42.499 --> 04:44.458
BUT HOW ARE YOU?
HOW'S SCHOOL?

04:44.458 --> 04:46.329
EVERYTHING'S OK.

04:53.031 --> 04:54.642
SORRY, EVERYBODY.

04:54.642 --> 04:56.339
SORRY I'M LATE.

04:56.339 --> 04:57.601
WHOA.
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.

04:57.601 --> 04:59.516
IS SHE YOURS,
MR. S?

04:59.516 --> 05:00.735
NOPE. NOPE.

05:00.735 --> 05:02.693
JUST FOUND HER
ON MY DOORSTEP.

05:02.693 --> 05:04.521
MR. SALINGER.

05:04.521 --> 05:06.784
MS. WALSH,
WE'RE, UH,

05:06.784 --> 05:09.004
JUST GETTING STARTED
HERE.

05:09.004 --> 05:11.136
NEW STUDENT?

05:11.136 --> 05:12.442
[BOTH LAUGH]

05:12.442 --> 05:14.270
EXTREMELY.

05:14.270 --> 05:15.924
I CAN, UH,
I CAN EXPLAIN

05:15.924 --> 05:17.491
ABOUT BRINGING HER
TO SCHOOL WITH ME.

05:17.491 --> 05:19.667
I, UH, GOT MY LITTLE
SISTER AT HOME, TOO.

05:19.667 --> 05:20.972
MY--MY LITTLE SISTER
AND MY LITTLE
BROTHER,

05:20.972 --> 05:22.365
AND, UH--

05:22.365 --> 05:23.366
AND YOU'RE
A SINGLE PARENT.

05:24.846 --> 05:26.891
TEACHER'S LOUNGE.
PEOPLE TALK.

05:26.891 --> 05:28.328
YEAH.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.894
WAY TOO MUCH.

05:31.548 --> 05:33.289
CAN I SHOW YOU
SOMETHING?

05:41.819 --> 05:43.038
Charlie:
DAY CARE?

05:43.038 --> 05:45.736
USED TO BE
THE MUSIC ROOM.

05:45.736 --> 05:47.869
COUPLE OF THE SINGLE
PARENTS ON THE STAFF

05:47.869 --> 05:49.566
CHIPPED IN
AND SET THIS UP.

05:49.566 --> 05:50.872
IF YOU'RE
INTERESTED,

05:50.872 --> 05:52.787
I CAN LET YOU KNOW
YOUR SHARE.

05:52.787 --> 05:56.094
GREAT, BUT, UH,
I'D RATHER NOT.

05:56.094 --> 05:57.966
SHE'S GOING THROUGH
THIS WEIRD THING
RIGHT NOW.

05:57.966 --> 05:59.620
DOESN'T WANT TO BE
LEFT WITH STRANGERS,

05:59.620 --> 06:02.623
SO I'D LIKE TO KEEP HER
IN THE CLASSROOM WITH ME,

06:02.623 --> 06:04.886
IF THERE AREN'T ANY RULES
AGAINST THAT.

06:04.886 --> 06:07.279
RULES, NO,

06:07.279 --> 06:09.847
BUT THE INSURANCE
SITUATION MIGHT BE
KIND OF IFFY.

06:09.847 --> 06:11.849
SEE, THIS--

06:11.849 --> 06:14.635
THIS DAY CARE STUFF...

06:14.635 --> 06:15.984
WHEN YOU'RE
A SINGLE PARENT,

06:15.984 --> 06:17.202
EVERYBODY FIGURES
THAT YOU NEED

06:17.202 --> 06:18.639
ALL KINDS OF HELP,
WHEN--

06:18.639 --> 06:20.728
ACTUALLY, I KNOW.

06:23.687 --> 06:24.949
HE'S MINE.

06:24.949 --> 06:26.995
ANDY.

06:26.995 --> 06:29.824
I'M ONE OF THOSE
SINGLE PARENTS
THAT I MENTIONED.

06:29.824 --> 06:31.478
EVEN THE VICE
PRINCIPAL

06:31.478 --> 06:33.349
NEEDS ALL THE HELP
SHE CAN GET.

06:33.349 --> 06:34.829
WE EVEN HAVE
A SUPPORT GROUP.

06:34.829 --> 06:36.744
SUPPORT GROUP'S
NOT EXACTLY MY...

06:36.744 --> 06:39.007
CUP OF TEA.
LIKE DAY CARE.

06:39.007 --> 06:41.357
SO, IS IT GOING TO BE OK

06:41.357 --> 06:42.880
IF I KEEP HER
IN THE ROOM WITH ME?

06:44.578 --> 06:46.449
I'LL SEE IF WE CAN
STRETCH A POINT.

06:46.449 --> 06:48.495
OK, THEN.

06:48.495 --> 06:50.410
I SHOULD, UH,
I SHOULD GET BACK,

06:50.410 --> 06:52.847
AND, UM, THANKS,
MS. WALSH.

06:52.847 --> 06:53.848

06:53.848 --> 06:55.719
OK.

07:09.951 --> 07:11.779
CLAUD,

07:11.779 --> 07:13.302
WHAT'S UP WITH THIS?

07:13.302 --> 07:15.043
IT'S FOR OWEN.
HE'LL LOVE IT.

07:15.043 --> 07:18.481
YOU KNOW, NOW THAT
HE'S THIS BIG CAMPER.

07:18.481 --> 07:20.614
MAN, I CAN BARELY
FIT IN HERE ANYMORE.

07:23.051 --> 07:24.313
HEY, CHAR.

07:24.313 --> 07:26.358
HEY.HEY, CLAUD.

07:26.358 --> 07:29.187
HEY, BUDDY.
WHO'S THE MAN?

07:29.187 --> 07:31.451
HEY, COOL.
CAN I PLAY IN THERE?

07:31.451 --> 07:32.669
Claudia: YOU CAN
SLEEP IN HERE.

07:32.669 --> 07:34.018
THAT'S WHY I SET
IT UP. COME ON.

07:34.018 --> 07:36.368
COOL.

07:36.368 --> 07:38.022
OLD TIMES, HUH?

07:38.022 --> 07:41.025
YEAH. ESPECIALLY
WITH JULIA HOME.

07:41.025 --> 07:42.505
JULIA'S HOME?

07:42.505 --> 07:44.159
IS EVERYTHING OK?

07:44.159 --> 07:45.116
WHY WOULDN'T IT BE?

07:45.116 --> 07:47.379
OH, NO REASON.

07:47.379 --> 07:49.294
IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW,
WE'RE GETTING READY
TO START FINALS,

07:49.294 --> 07:50.774
BUT YOU'RE PROBABLY
ON A DIFFERENT
SCHEDULE THAN US.

07:50.774 --> 07:52.428
OH, NO. US, TOO,

07:52.428 --> 07:55.039
BUT, UM, I'D JUST RATHER
STUDY HERE, THAT'S ALL.

07:55.039 --> 07:57.041
CAN I TAKE
THE LITTLE BEAUTY?

07:57.041 --> 08:00.523
YEAH. HEE HEE. HI.

08:01.959 --> 08:04.919
SO, UM,
HOW'S HE BEEN?

08:04.919 --> 08:07.443
WELL,

08:07.443 --> 08:08.836
WE HAD A GREAT TIME
CAMPING,

08:08.836 --> 08:10.620
AND HE'S MOSTLY
OVER HIS COLD.

08:10.620 --> 08:13.754
THAT'S NOT
WHAT I'M ASKING.

08:16.017 --> 08:17.714
WELL, I'M NOT
GOING TO LIE,

08:17.714 --> 08:20.674
YOU'VE GOT YOUR WORK
CUT OUT FOR YOU.

08:20.674 --> 08:22.153
HE STILL MAD
THAT I DIDN'T
COME GET HIM?

08:22.153 --> 08:24.895
HE'LL GET OVER THAT,
RIGHT?

08:25.853 --> 08:27.158
BUT...

08:27.158 --> 08:29.291
MAYBE WE SHOULD
MAKE THIS REGULAR,

08:29.291 --> 08:31.032
ME TAKING HIM.

08:31.032 --> 08:33.077
YOU KNOW, WEEKENDS.
A WEEK.

08:33.077 --> 08:35.036
I MEAN, HOW MANY PLATES
DO YOU NEED SPINNING
IN THE AIR?

08:35.036 --> 08:36.472
THINK I CAN'T
SWING IT?

08:36.472 --> 08:38.779
NO, BUT DO I THINK
IT WOULD BE BETTER

08:38.779 --> 08:40.476
IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO?
YES, I DO.

08:40.476 --> 08:41.433
I GOT IT COVERED,
BAY.

08:41.433 --> 08:43.523
CHARLIE...

08:43.523 --> 08:45.002
DAPHNE LEFT.

08:45.002 --> 08:47.918
THAT'S--WHATEVER WAY
IT WENT DOWN,

08:47.918 --> 08:49.093
YOU LOVED HER,

08:49.093 --> 08:50.530
YOU HAD A BABY
WITH HER,

08:50.530 --> 08:51.966
AND IT'S OK FOR YOU
TO LET IT HURT,

08:51.966 --> 08:54.055
BUT I DON'T SEE YOU
DOING THAT, MAN.

08:54.055 --> 08:55.273
I GET THAT YOU'RE
CONCERNED, BAY,

08:55.273 --> 08:56.884
BUT, UH...

08:56.884 --> 08:58.581
BUT...

08:58.581 --> 09:01.366
BUT LET'S JUST DROP
THE WHOLE SUBJECT, RIGHT?

09:05.370 --> 09:07.285
THAT'S WHAT I WAS
TRYING TO TELL HIM.

09:07.285 --> 09:09.331
LOOK, CHARLIE
JUST NEEDS TO THINK
HE CAN DO IT ALL.

09:09.331 --> 09:10.767
I READ ABOUT IT
IN PSYCH.

09:10.767 --> 09:13.161
IT'S CALLED
THE SUPERMAN COMPLEX.

09:13.161 --> 09:14.554
YEAH, WELL,
IT'S ALSO CALLED

09:14.554 --> 09:16.773
HE'S GOT TO CUT
HIMSELF SOME SLACK.

09:16.773 --> 09:17.992
THIS WON'T
TAKE A SECOND.

09:17.992 --> 09:19.254
I JUST HAVE
TO FIND THE DISK

09:19.254 --> 09:20.516
THAT ARTHUR
PUT THE ACCOUNTS ON.

09:20.516 --> 09:23.040
THEN WE CAN
GET OUT OF HERE.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.697
DO YOU SEE IT
ANYWHERE?

09:27.697 --> 09:29.699
NO.

09:29.699 --> 09:31.092

21:04.263 --> 21:06.395
HE'S A GUY.

21:06.395 --> 21:07.744
THEY TURN EVERYTHING
INTO THE NEED

21:07.744 --> 21:10.878
TO SMASH SOMETHING
OR SOMEBODY.

21:13.054 --> 21:14.751
BUT ME...

21:15.883 --> 21:17.406
WHAT IS IT?

21:18.538 --> 21:21.802
THE GUY...

21:21.802 --> 21:24.718
HE DID A TERRIBLE
THING TO ME,
AND YET,

21:24.718 --> 21:27.634
I'M THE ONE
WHO FEELS DIRTY.

21:27.634 --> 21:31.290
YOU KNOW, LIKE I DID
SOMETHING WRONG.

21:31.290 --> 21:34.075
I'M THE VICTIM,
AND I FEEL ASHAMED.

21:34.075 --> 21:36.599
GOD,
ACTUALLY ASHAMED.

21:36.599 --> 21:39.298
DOES THAT EVEN
MAKE SENSE?

21:54.922 --> 21:56.184

WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

21:56.184 --> 21:58.273

22:01.102 --> 22:02.538
OH, HEY, JULIA.

22:02.538 --> 22:05.193
I THINK DIANA HERE
LIKES NED MORE THAN ME.

22:05.193 --> 22:07.848
NED.

22:07.848 --> 22:10.416
COME WITH ME.

22:10.416 --> 22:12.069
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

22:39.575 --> 22:41.621
NO, YOU HOLD ON.
THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN.

22:41.621 --> 22:43.579
THAT IS NOT
GOING TO HAPPEN.

22:43.579 --> 22:46.582
OK, SO SOMETIMES
WE DON'T UNDERSTAND
EACH OTHER.

22:46.582 --> 22:47.844
LIKE--LIKE YOU
TELL ME SOMETHING,

22:47.844 --> 22:49.193
AND I THINK
MAYBE YOU'RE LYING

22:49.193 --> 22:51.152
BECAUSE I DIDN'T
KNOW ABOUT RICHIE,

22:51.152 --> 22:52.849
AND I DIDN'T KNOW
ABOUT YOUR PROBLEMS
WITH YOUR DAD,

22:52.849 --> 22:54.938
BUT WE TALKED.
WE TALKED IT OUT.

22:54.938 --> 22:57.376
I MEAN, AT LEAST
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT
WE WERE DOING.

22:57.376 --> 22:58.986

WHEN YOU DON'T
GET YOUR WAY

23:07.603 --> 23:09.779
WHAT?JULIA, I DIDN'T HIT YOU.

23:09.779 --> 23:11.041
THAT'S NOT
WHAT HAPPENED.

23:11.041 --> 23:12.129

23:12.129 --> 23:13.392
I HEARD YOU.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.002
NOW ARE YOU GOING
TO HEAR ME?

23:15.002 --> 23:16.438
NO, I DON'T
HAVE TO, NED.

23:16.438 --> 23:17.526

GOING TO SAY SOMETHING

23:17.526 --> 23:18.875
TOTALLY INSANE.

23:18.875 --> 23:19.963
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED TO ME.

23:19.963 --> 23:21.312
I GOT EXCITED.

23:21.312 --> 23:23.793
WE GOT EXCITED, OK?
THAT HAPPENED,

23:23.793 --> 23:26.230

HOW I FELT

23:31.061 --> 23:32.498

WITH THEM?

23:32.498 --> 23:33.673

23:33.673 --> 23:34.848
THAT I WAS GOING
TO DO SOMETHING

23:34.848 --> 23:36.589

ABSOLUTELY CRAZY.

I'M NOT--

DO YOU HEAR ME

23:50.211 --> 23:52.082
THAT WHAT I DID
WAS RIGHT?

23:52.082 --> 23:53.214
DON'T YOU THINK
I REALIZE

23:53.214 --> 23:54.520
THAT I TOTALLY
LOST IT?

23:54.520 --> 23:55.738
THAT I GOT SO
OUT OF CONTROL

23:55.738 --> 23:57.827

I'M SCARED

24:11.885 --> 24:13.974
I'M GOING
TO LOSE YOU.

24:15.715 --> 24:17.847
I GOT THAT "STUPID"
APARTMENT

24:17.847 --> 24:20.763
SO THAT WE
COULD BE TOGETHER.

24:20.763 --> 24:22.635
IT WAS FOR US.

24:23.853 --> 24:26.813
AND I JUST
GOT FRUSTRATED

24:26.813 --> 24:28.684
WHEN YOU DIDN'T
UNDERSTAND THAT,

24:28.684 --> 24:31.513
AND I THOUGHT
THAT YOU DIDN'T
WANT IT,

24:31.513 --> 24:33.950

I'M SORRY.

24:43.786 --> 24:46.136
OK, JUST LEAVE. LEAVE.

24:46.136 --> 24:48.574

THE OTHER DAY.

24:48.574 --> 24:49.879
SAME WAY.

24:49.879 --> 24:52.273
YOU TURNED AWAY,
I GRABBED YOU,

24:52.273 --> 24:54.928
