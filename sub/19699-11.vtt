03:57.585 --> 03:59.282
Very well.

Goodbye, John.

04:45.633 --> 04:48.331
So, is this it, is it?

04:48.375 --> 04:50.551
No hug goodbye?

04:52.944 --> 04:54.859
Is this really
how you're going to end it?

04:54.903 --> 04:57.035
Well, it appears so.

04:57.079 --> 04:58.515
It's my understanding
that the U.S. Government

04:58.559 --> 04:59.473

05:05.479 --> 05:08.003
That's the plan.

05:12.050 --> 05:14.357
I have a better idea.
Why don't you just kill me?

05:14.401 --> 05:17.055
Get it over and done with.

05:17.099 --> 05:18.361
No, I don't think so.

05:18.405 --> 05:19.710

want to go back to 1893,

05:24.411 --> 05:29.459
and always know somewhere
in the back of your mind

05:29.503 --> 05:32.506

still out there?

05:32.549 --> 05:34.464
Well, you won't be
out anywhere, John.

05:34.508 --> 05:36.901
You'll be in a cold,
isolated little prison cell,

05:36.945 --> 05:38.990

your remaining days.
