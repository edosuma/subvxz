WEBVTT

00:58.192 --> 01:00.928
- Hello.
- Hello, everybody.

01:00.994 --> 01:02.496
Greetings. Hello.

01:03.764 --> 01:04.732
Hello.

01:06.867 --> 01:08.302
JEREMY: Thank you so much.

01:10.671 --> 01:13.874
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

01:13.941 --> 01:15.143
Thank you.

01:15.143 --> 01:16.277
Thank you so much,

01:16.344 --> 01:18.346
and welcome to The Grand Tour,

01:18.412 --> 01:19.947
which this week comes to you

01:20.013 --> 01:22.716
from the United Arab Emirates!

01:27.255 --> 01:28.422
Specifically...

01:30.424 --> 01:34.162
Specifically,
we are in Dubai,

01:34.228 --> 01:36.330
which means,
for the first time ever,

01:36.397 --> 01:38.699
we are the three poorest people
in the tent.

01:38.766 --> 01:40.368
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

01:40.434 --> 01:41.535
I mean, look at that.

01:41.602 --> 01:42.936
You think,
"How do they do that

01:43.003 --> 01:44.238
with all those fountains?"

01:44.305 --> 01:46.374
Well, I'll let you
into a little secret.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.841
It's Perrier water.

01:48.976 --> 01:51.479
Flinging it up into the air.

01:51.545 --> 01:53.181
I heard another one
the other day.

01:53.214 --> 01:54.782
A taxi driver
clearing out his cab

01:54.848 --> 01:56.484
after a hard day at work--

01:56.550 --> 01:58.986
umbrella, mobile phone,
usual stuff--

01:59.052 --> 02:02.022
£800,000 gold bar.

02:02.089 --> 02:03.391
Someone had left it in there

02:03.457 --> 02:06.960
- and not even noticed.
- You would.

02:07.027 --> 02:08.562
Mind you, that said, here,

02:08.629 --> 02:11.332
you can just go to an ATM
and get gold out.

02:11.399 --> 02:13.767
Look at this!
That's an actual ATM.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.469
You know, at two o'clock
in the morning,

02:15.536 --> 02:17.438
"I haven't got
an ingot with me."

02:17.505 --> 02:19.273
But here you're fine.

02:19.340 --> 02:21.809
You can even buy
tyres here, OK?

02:21.875 --> 02:24.878
Which are studded
with gold and diamonds.

02:24.945 --> 02:28.649
Look at this. £600,000 a set.

02:28.716 --> 02:30.851
Even the authorities
are loaded.

02:30.918 --> 02:33.787
We have here
a selection of pictures
of local police cars.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.523
They have an Aventador.

02:35.589 --> 02:38.125
- They also have an SLS.

02:38.226 --> 02:41.128
Yeah. Wait for it. They even
have a Veyron police car.

02:41.229 --> 02:43.397
- Oh, yeah. Obviously,

02:43.464 --> 02:44.898
- because you need that.
- You actually do.

02:44.965 --> 02:46.934
You need that.
It's important.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.237
I've even got a photograph
of a local ambulance.

02:49.237 --> 02:52.240
- Look, here it is.
It's a Lotus!

02:52.240 --> 02:53.807
Not quite sure how that works.

02:53.874 --> 02:56.377
Presumably you have to break
the patient's other leg

02:56.444 --> 02:58.879
to actually get him in there.

02:58.946 --> 03:00.614
- Yeah.
- Then there's
public transport.

03:00.681 --> 03:04.117
Now, OK, in the UK,
this is a bus, yes?

03:04.252 --> 03:05.386
- Yeah.
- Let me show you

03:05.453 --> 03:07.154
a photograph
of a local bus here.

03:07.255 --> 03:08.289
- There you go.
- Wow!

03:10.090 --> 03:12.460
Top speed: 155mph.

03:12.526 --> 03:15.429
Costs £7 million.
Seats 23 people.

03:15.496 --> 03:17.731
You telephone the owner.
He comes and picks you up

03:17.798 --> 03:20.033
and takes you
to where you want to go.

03:20.100 --> 03:21.535
Well, that's a taxi.

03:21.602 --> 03:23.704
- No, James. No, no, no.

03:23.771 --> 03:26.607
A taxi in Dubai
looks like this.

03:26.674 --> 03:28.476
RICHARD:
Oh, right. Yeah, of course.

03:28.542 --> 03:31.144
You think I'm joking?
Look, "Uber".

03:31.279 --> 03:33.381
Seriously, you call
Uber up here,

03:33.447 --> 03:36.284
and you're given a choice--
Prius or helicopter.

03:36.317 --> 03:38.752
Wow! Do you get
to rate the driver?

03:38.819 --> 03:40.588
Do you think he sticks
his telephone on the screen

03:40.654 --> 03:42.490
like in Britain in the Prius?

03:42.556 --> 03:43.991
"I'm not really a pilot.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.159
I'm doing this while
training to be a plumber."

03:46.294 --> 03:47.861
"I want to get out!"
Just get out.

03:47.928 --> 03:50.063
- Shall we get
on with the show?
- Good idea.

03:50.130 --> 03:52.766
Because in our car show
this week...

03:54.302 --> 03:55.903
James falls over.

03:55.969 --> 03:56.937
Ow!

03:58.439 --> 04:01.041
James fall over again.

04:03.143 --> 04:04.778
And James falls over.

04:08.516 --> 04:10.518
But first, there's been
a bit of an argument.

04:10.584 --> 04:13.186
You see, James and I
both recently bought

04:13.321 --> 04:15.523
five-door German hatchbacks.

04:15.589 --> 04:19.693
His is a BMW i3, which
is powered by electricity,

04:19.760 --> 04:23.964
and mine is a conventional
Volkswagen Golf GTI.

04:24.031 --> 04:26.667
Yes, meaning my car
is from the future

04:26.734 --> 04:28.569
and his is from the past,

04:28.636 --> 04:31.905
making me enlightened
and him a dinosaur.

04:31.972 --> 04:35.543
They have been arguing
like this for a while now.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.345
The thing is, I don't doubt

04:37.411 --> 04:39.847
that in the future
electric cars will work,

04:39.913 --> 04:41.415
but they don't work now.

04:41.482 --> 04:43.150
- Well, they do.
- They don't, James!

04:43.216 --> 04:44.652
Well, why did you fit yours

04:44.718 --> 04:46.887
with a petrol-powered
range extender?

04:46.954 --> 04:48.722
Well, that's just
a little generator

04:48.789 --> 04:51.659
that keeps the battery
topped up if I need it.

04:51.725 --> 04:54.127
What you're saying is you
can't rely on new technology.

04:54.194 --> 04:55.696
And your seats,
they're made

04:55.763 --> 04:57.365
from the contents
of a Hoover bag.

04:57.431 --> 04:59.367
- Oh, says the man...

04:59.433 --> 05:01.435
Says the man whose
seats are made

05:01.502 --> 05:03.371
from Jackie Stewart's
old trousers,

05:03.437 --> 05:04.505
which they are.

05:04.572 --> 05:06.507
- It's- -
- Whatever!

05:06.574 --> 05:07.841
The fact is, in the office,

05:07.908 --> 05:09.677
we decided we'd had
enough of them bickering

05:09.743 --> 05:12.380
and told them to go out
and do a proper road test.

05:12.413 --> 05:15.182
So we did.

05:15.248 --> 05:16.917
JAMES: We began in London

05:16.984 --> 05:18.285
with a real-world test

05:18.386 --> 05:20.220
that Clarkson had thought of.

05:20.287 --> 05:21.755
Right, James, we must now see

05:21.822 --> 05:24.392
who can open their back door
in the shortest time.

05:24.392 --> 05:26.093
- There could be an emergency.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.661
People will want to know.

05:27.728 --> 05:29.630
Ready, steady, go!
Oh, mine's open.

05:29.697 --> 05:31.198
- Oh, dear.

05:31.264 --> 05:32.766
Have you got
to open your front door

05:32.833 --> 05:35.636
before you open that--
let's be honest

05:35.703 --> 05:37.538
- It's not a flap.
- It is a flap.

05:37.605 --> 05:39.473
Are BMW saying that,
in the future,

05:39.540 --> 05:41.542
children will only be
three inches wide?

05:41.609 --> 05:42.810
What are you talking about?

05:42.876 --> 05:44.277
For a start,
it's hardly a hardship,

05:44.412 --> 05:45.813
and that's
an enormous space.

05:45.879 --> 05:47.448
You only wanted
to do that test

05:47.515 --> 05:49.417
because you made a mistake.
He made a mistake.

05:49.417 --> 05:50.684
I didn't. What mistake?

05:50.751 --> 05:52.520
You did. You wanted
a three-door Golf,

05:52.586 --> 05:53.987
and you didn't fill
the form in properly.

05:54.054 --> 05:56.757
I know that.
You can't tick boxes.

05:56.824 --> 05:58.125
Five doors
are better-looking.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.493
No, they're not.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.429
Nobody ever wanted
a five-door Golf GTI.

06:01.429 --> 06:03.531
- It's really naff.
- We've got to get on
and talk about money.

06:03.597 --> 06:04.998
He also wanted a red one.

06:05.065 --> 06:06.900
He didn't fill that bit in
properly, either.

06:14.908 --> 06:19.012
This car, with many,
many optional extras,

06:19.079 --> 06:21.582
was £36,000.

06:21.649 --> 06:24.718
Whereas James May's
BMW i3 was...

06:24.785 --> 06:27.755
Well... let's find out,
shall we?

06:27.821 --> 06:30.223
JEREMY OVER RADIO:
How much was your i3?

06:30.290 --> 06:32.192
Well, it was £40,000,

06:32.259 --> 06:34.695
but I got £5,000 back
from the government,

06:34.762 --> 06:36.363
so actually it's £35,000,

06:36.464 --> 06:38.031
which is less than yours,
I think.

06:38.098 --> 06:40.601
You were given,
by the government,

06:40.668 --> 06:44.505
£5,000 of taxpayers' money

06:44.572 --> 06:46.774
so you could buy that car?

06:46.840 --> 06:49.342
I didn't make the rules.
You can't turn it down.

06:49.477 --> 06:51.144
It's not like
the Beatles' OBE.

06:51.211 --> 06:52.713
That is obscene!

06:52.780 --> 06:54.815
I mean, James May
is a wealthy man,

06:54.882 --> 06:59.119
but that bus driver
has bought his car for him.

06:59.186 --> 07:01.021
Where's the justice in that?

07:03.190 --> 07:06.059
You're paying for his car.
Do you know that?

07:06.126 --> 07:07.394
You have paid for it.

07:07.495 --> 07:10.030
Just so you know,
you've paid for his car.

07:10.097 --> 07:13.366
Has James May thanked you
for buying his car for him?

07:13.501 --> 07:15.102
Jeremy will have
an opinion on this,

07:15.168 --> 07:18.506
despite having bought a farm
on which, for many years,

07:18.572 --> 07:22.543
he was paid
to not grow anything.

07:22.610 --> 07:23.877
Congestion charge here.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.113
It's £11.50
to drive into the centre.

07:26.179 --> 07:28.415
- JAMES: Not for me, it isn't.
- JEREMY: Of course it isn't.

07:28.516 --> 07:31.184
The taxi driver, is he paying
for your congestion charge?

07:31.251 --> 07:34.421
I suppose everybody
must pay a little bit.

07:34.522 --> 07:38.025
* James May, James May
Stealing from the rich *

07:38.091 --> 07:41.562
* James May, James May
Stealing from the poor *

07:41.629 --> 07:45.633
* He steals from the rich
He steals from the poor *

07:45.699 --> 07:48.368
* And once more,
wants it all *

07:48.435 --> 07:50.704
* That's appalling *

07:51.572 --> 07:52.840
It nearly works.

07:54.407 --> 07:55.909
JAMES:
I'd had enough of this,

07:55.976 --> 07:57.811
so I came up with a new way
of trying to prove

07:57.878 --> 08:00.080
my car was better than his.

08:04.217 --> 08:07.287
James, can I just ask,
why have you brought me
to London Airport?

08:07.354 --> 08:12.025
Because I want to prove that
my car is faster than yours.

08:12.092 --> 08:13.927
That's funny, because I
just heard you say

08:13.994 --> 08:15.462
that your car's
faster than mine.

08:15.563 --> 08:17.364
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

08:17.430 --> 08:19.299
- 167 horsepower.
- Mm-hm.

08:19.366 --> 08:23.604
Mine has the performance
pack, so it produces 227.

08:23.671 --> 08:24.772
- Yes.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.173
That's the official
figure, is it?

08:26.239 --> 08:27.207
Yes, it is.

08:27.274 --> 08:28.375
- Yes.

08:28.441 --> 08:31.612
- Yes.

08:31.679 --> 08:33.614
All right, listen,
I know what you mean.

08:33.681 --> 08:36.049
Drag race: 0-150.

08:36.116 --> 08:38.051
No.

08:38.118 --> 08:40.387
JEREMY:
Having not agreed on that,

08:40.453 --> 08:41.822
we then failed to agree

08:41.889 --> 08:44.324
on where the finishing
line should be.

08:44.391 --> 08:47.160
James wanted a short race...

08:47.227 --> 08:48.696
and I didn't.

08:50.764 --> 08:53.066
- Compromise.
- It isn't. That's too short.

08:53.133 --> 08:55.102
- It's not.
It's exactly right.
- It is.

08:55.168 --> 08:57.938
But eventually,
we were ready to go.

09:03.076 --> 09:04.678
Now, the thing to remember,
viewers,

09:04.745 --> 09:06.046
is that an electric motor

09:06.113 --> 09:08.682
delivers enormous
torque from nothing,

09:08.749 --> 09:10.217
from really low down.

09:10.283 --> 09:11.484
So over a short distance,

09:11.619 --> 09:13.687
I should absolutely
cream this.

09:13.754 --> 09:15.222
Here we go.

09:15.288 --> 09:17.257
JEREMY: DCC-- normal.

09:17.324 --> 09:19.526
Steering-- normal.

09:19.627 --> 09:21.995
Drive-- eco.

09:22.062 --> 09:24.998
No point in ruining
my own car to win this.

09:45.518 --> 09:46.754
No need to rush.

09:47.688 --> 09:50.323
I'm winning. Oh, yes!

09:52.726 --> 09:54.962
I'm still winning.

09:55.028 --> 09:56.964
Let's go get him.
Come on, Golfy!

09:58.398 --> 09:59.767
No. No!

10:00.734 --> 10:02.602
Quite sprightly, but er...

10:02.670 --> 10:05.605
not sprightly enough,
methinks.

10:05.673 --> 10:06.840
See you, James.

10:14.915 --> 10:17.350
Bah! I've made the future
look rubbish

10:17.417 --> 10:19.286
on the television.

10:19.352 --> 10:21.889
JEREMY: And then,
to make it look even worse,

10:21.955 --> 10:23.691
I told the benefit scrounger

10:23.757 --> 10:25.693
that we were setting off
for Devon.

10:26.794 --> 10:29.596
Erm...
Why are we going to Devon?

10:29.663 --> 10:31.732
Because we have
two tickets tonight

10:31.799 --> 10:34.634
to see Roger Daltrey
out of the Who

10:34.702 --> 10:38.105
perform at a pub on Dartmoor.

10:38.171 --> 10:39.606
Couldn't we just wait for him

10:39.673 --> 10:41.308
to come and maybe
perform in London?

10:41.374 --> 10:43.677
- Because I'm sure he will.
- Well, no.

10:43.744 --> 10:45.879
Because it's a 200-mile
drive, or thereabouts,

10:45.946 --> 10:47.614
it'll give us an opportunity

10:47.681 --> 10:50.117
to see how our cars work
in the real world.

10:50.183 --> 10:52.686
What he means is
it's an opportunity
for him to claim

10:52.753 --> 10:56.957
that the car of the past
is superior.

10:57.024 --> 10:59.092
To prove it wasn't,
I needed to top up

10:59.159 --> 11:02.730
the charge I'd lost
by doing the drag race.

11:02.796 --> 11:05.733
Right, if I look
at settings on my satnav,

11:05.766 --> 11:09.236
I can look at
where all the charging
and petrol stations are.

11:09.302 --> 11:11.872
I can even tell
what sort of charging point

11:11.939 --> 11:13.807
I am being offered,

11:13.874 --> 11:18.045
whether or not I have
the right card for it.

11:18.111 --> 11:21.448
And soon, we found exactly
what I was looking for.

11:33.126 --> 11:35.095
- JEREMY: It's the future.
- Another one.

11:35.162 --> 11:38.031
- Oh, that's such a shame.
- Oh, shut up!

11:38.098 --> 11:40.433
Because I didn't have enough
juice in the batteries

11:40.500 --> 11:42.335
to make the next
charge point,

11:42.402 --> 11:45.272
I had to turn on
my petrol generator,

11:45.338 --> 11:46.940
which stopped them
going even flatter,

11:47.007 --> 11:51.344
and engaged ECO PRO+
driving mode.

11:51.411 --> 11:54.681
It does mean
I have to do 56mph.

11:54.782 --> 11:59.019
That's where ECO PRO+
sets the maximum speed,

11:59.086 --> 12:01.021
because that way you
get the maximum range.

12:01.088 --> 12:03.556
But it means I'm effectively
a lorry driver.

12:03.623 --> 12:06.493
Because I'm in ECO PRO,
I don't get any
air-conditioning

12:06.559 --> 12:08.061
or climate control at all,

12:08.128 --> 12:10.163
because that wastes
electricity,

12:10.230 --> 12:13.433
so the car
is slowly steaming up.

12:13.500 --> 12:14.802
It's now warning me. It says,

12:14.868 --> 12:17.204
"Find a charge station,
you idiot!"

12:17.270 --> 12:21.008
How many screws do you have
to have loose before you say

12:21.074 --> 12:23.276
"Yes, I'm gonna buy a car,

12:23.343 --> 12:25.813
which, when it's running
low on power,

12:25.879 --> 12:28.281
has to be driven at 8mph,

12:28.348 --> 12:30.851
with the air conditioning
off, and the lights off,

12:30.918 --> 12:33.120
and the heater off,
and the radio off.

12:34.454 --> 12:36.890
Why would you do that?

12:36.957 --> 12:38.859
After several lifetimes

12:38.926 --> 12:40.928
of driving in convoy
with James,

12:40.994 --> 12:42.095
we finally found

12:42.162 --> 12:44.231
a charge point that worked.

12:46.733 --> 12:48.068
JAMES: That's it.

12:48.135 --> 12:49.302
- Yes.

12:49.369 --> 12:50.838
You don't have to stand
and watch it.

12:50.871 --> 12:52.339
It's not like petrol.
We can go off

12:52.405 --> 12:55.075
and have a cup
of coffee, a sticky bun.

12:55.142 --> 12:57.477
- An hour or so.

12:57.544 --> 12:59.046
- Yeah.

12:59.112 --> 13:02.315
How much does it cost...
to fill it up?

13:02.382 --> 13:03.350
Nothing.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.854
- It's free.

13:06.887 --> 13:08.989
- It's free.

13:09.056 --> 13:10.891
You have to get the card,
but it doesn't cost...

13:10.958 --> 13:13.260
- Nothing.

13:13.326 --> 13:14.862
You fill a form in
on the Internet,

13:14.928 --> 13:16.229
and it comes in the post.

13:16.296 --> 13:17.865
So I'm paying for your fuel--

13:17.865 --> 13:19.599
well, your electricity--
as well?

13:19.666 --> 13:20.934
Probably.

13:21.001 --> 13:22.369
I'm just staggered by this.

13:22.435 --> 13:23.736
This is iniquitous.

13:23.871 --> 13:26.506
JEREMY: After killing time
for a few minutes...

13:26.573 --> 13:28.241
I'm just gonna try
and win some money

13:28.308 --> 13:31.011
to pay for James May's
heating bill this year,

13:31.078 --> 13:34.581
which... will undoubtedly
be down to me.

13:34.647 --> 13:37.384
...I decided I couldn't be
bothered to wait any more,

13:37.450 --> 13:40.387
so I recharged
the old-fashioned way

13:40.453 --> 13:43.290
and, in moments,
was back on the road.

13:45.993 --> 13:47.895
Britain only produces

13:47.895 --> 13:51.899
5% more power
than it actually consumes.

13:51.899 --> 13:56.069
That's now. So if everybody
starts buying electric cars,

13:56.136 --> 13:58.138
the power stations
won't be able to cope.

13:58.205 --> 13:59.539
There'll be power cuts,

13:59.606 --> 14:02.009
and then there will be
looting and anarchy.

14:02.075 --> 14:03.810
That's what James is doing.

14:03.911 --> 14:07.080
He is bringing Britain
to its knees.

14:14.654 --> 14:15.923
Oh.

14:15.956 --> 14:17.224
Yes.

14:17.290 --> 14:19.726
Here's something for Jeremy.

14:19.792 --> 14:21.261
Assuming he's got
a CD player.

14:21.328 --> 14:23.296
He's probably got
a cassette player

14:23.363 --> 14:24.764
in his Golf GTI.

14:24.831 --> 14:26.066
JEREMY:
Actually,

14:26.133 --> 14:29.236
May couldn't have
been more wrong.

14:29.302 --> 14:32.339
This car may be from the past,
but check this out.

14:32.405 --> 14:34.574
It's accelerating now,
you can probably hear that,

14:34.641 --> 14:35.943
but I'm not doing it.

14:35.943 --> 14:37.610
The radar in front of me

14:37.677 --> 14:39.612
is maintaining a safe distance

14:39.679 --> 14:42.249
behind the car in front.

14:42.315 --> 14:44.184
He goes faster, I go faster.

14:44.251 --> 14:45.485
He slows down, I slow down.

14:45.552 --> 14:46.954
Car pulling out now
into the middle lane.

14:46.954 --> 14:48.255
The car will sense that.

14:48.321 --> 14:50.023
Yeah. It's now dropping me

14:50.090 --> 14:51.291
back from that.

14:51.358 --> 14:53.326
I don't even have to steer,

14:53.393 --> 14:55.762
because it'll keep itself
between the white lines.

14:55.828 --> 14:56.964
Look.

14:56.964 --> 14:58.665
Google is making a big fuss.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.033
"Ooh, aren't we clever?

15:00.100 --> 15:01.634
We're making
a self-driving car."

15:01.701 --> 15:04.104
It's already here!
I'm driving it.

15:04.171 --> 15:06.473
And it's from 1978.

15:09.476 --> 15:11.111
JAMES:
After an hour's charging,

15:11.178 --> 15:13.880
I was back on the move.

15:13.981 --> 15:16.249
I actually think the service
station on the motorway

15:16.316 --> 15:18.718
should have an
electric-car driver section,

15:18.785 --> 15:20.287
where there are, you know,

15:20.353 --> 15:22.589
very complicated jigsaw
puzzles and a Monopoly set,

15:22.655 --> 15:25.458
or maybe some
painting-by-numbers.

15:27.127 --> 15:29.997
It is 170 miles to go.

15:30.063 --> 15:33.300
God, look at it.
It's all the way down there.

15:33.366 --> 15:35.002
JEREMY: Many miles ahead,

15:35.002 --> 15:36.436
I was busy firing up

15:36.503 --> 15:39.839
the GTI's
Apple CarPlay system.

15:39.906 --> 15:43.110
Right, I'm gonna send
James May a text message now,

15:43.176 --> 15:45.112
which would be illegal
in most cars,

15:45.178 --> 15:46.779
but not in this one.

15:46.846 --> 15:49.516
AUTOMATED VOICE: To whom
should I send your message?

15:49.582 --> 15:51.184
May.

15:51.251 --> 15:53.886
What was that again?
Uh-oh, something's wrong.

15:54.021 --> 15:55.755
Can you try again?

15:55.822 --> 15:56.823
Edit that out.

15:56.889 --> 15:58.558
To whom shall I send it?

15:59.726 --> 16:00.627
May.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.397
I don't know what you
mean by "Barry".

16:04.464 --> 16:07.034
- I didn't say "Barry".

16:07.067 --> 16:09.036
May.

16:09.102 --> 16:12.539
This is not doing well,
Volkswagen. Come on.

16:12.605 --> 16:15.875
OK. What do you
want to say to May?

16:15.942 --> 16:17.710
"May,
you're a blithering idiot,

16:17.777 --> 16:21.514
and your stupid car
is ruining my day."

16:22.482 --> 16:24.084
Your message to May says,

16:24.151 --> 16:27.320
"Your brother is idiot and
your stupid car is ready."

16:27.387 --> 16:28.721
Ready to send it?

16:33.226 --> 16:34.461
JAMES:
"Your brother is idiot"?

16:34.527 --> 16:36.863
What?
He's never met my brother.

16:36.929 --> 16:39.632
How does he know
he's an idiot?

16:39.699 --> 16:41.634
JEREMY: Because I'd
turned off the motorway

16:41.701 --> 16:43.903
to take the more direct
route to Dartmoor,

16:43.970 --> 16:47.240
I thought I'd better let
James know that as well.

16:49.709 --> 16:54.081
Erm... I'm going
on the A34 and the A303.

16:54.147 --> 16:55.648
I'll see you there.

16:57.984 --> 16:59.819
Your message to May says,

16:59.886 --> 17:02.889
"I'm going on the first
floor of the three RC."

17:02.955 --> 17:04.257
Ready to send it?

17:08.728 --> 17:11.931
JAMES: I, meanwhile,
was using the longer
motorway route

17:11.998 --> 17:14.634
because there'd be
more charging points.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.203
But I had my foot down.

17:19.672 --> 17:23.110
And now... the electric car
of the future

17:23.110 --> 17:27.780
is overtaking
a Porsche 911 Turbo S.

17:27.847 --> 17:29.682
There we go.

17:29.749 --> 17:33.786
I'm driving along
in a car on the motorway

17:33.853 --> 17:35.822
at motorway speeds,

17:35.888 --> 17:37.590
overtaking everybody.

17:39.526 --> 17:41.294
Oh, no. Since I filled up,

17:41.361 --> 17:44.864
I've used...
an eighth of a tank.

17:44.931 --> 17:46.533
Oh, no!

17:48.535 --> 17:51.838
And soon I was deep
in the Devon countryside,

17:51.904 --> 17:55.142
where my excellent
motorway cruising machine

17:55.208 --> 17:57.210
had become a GTI.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.585
We're in full sport mode now.

18:09.522 --> 18:12.359
It's got an astonishing
front differential,

18:12.425 --> 18:15.228
so you can hurl the car
into any corner

18:15.295 --> 18:17.630
at any speed
that takes your fancy,

18:17.697 --> 18:21.301
knowing you're gonna come out
on the other side OK.

18:23.870 --> 18:25.505
I'm not kidding.
On a road like this

18:25.572 --> 18:28.275
with wet leaves
and mud everywhere,

18:28.341 --> 18:32.979
this car is as fast
as any Ferrari.

18:33.045 --> 18:34.214
It just is.

18:38.985 --> 18:40.487
Many hours from now,

18:40.553 --> 18:42.655
James May's going to be
coming along here saying,

18:42.722 --> 18:45.792
"Right, I've got
13% battery and 2% fuel,

18:45.858 --> 18:49.696
so if I do 13.8 miles
to the gallon, I should..."

18:49.762 --> 18:50.863
Who wants to do maths

18:50.930 --> 18:53.300
when they could do
lift

18:55.968 --> 18:59.506
JAMES: In the i3, thanks
to my exuberant driving,

18:59.572 --> 19:02.642
I was indeed
having to do some maths.

19:03.543 --> 19:05.512
Energy management update:

19:05.578 --> 19:09.382
I have 36 miles
of electric power remaining,

19:09.449 --> 19:11.251
if I'm driving like this,

19:11.318 --> 19:14.687
and 34 miles
of petrol range left.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.689
So I'm going to stop
at these services

19:16.756 --> 19:19.759
and I'm going to fill up
the little fuel tank.

19:23.330 --> 19:25.232
Nine quid.
That is absolutely...

19:25.265 --> 19:26.766
I've overfilled it, in fact.

19:30.370 --> 19:32.071
If you drive a GTI,

19:32.138 --> 19:35.575
you're going to get to where
you're going more quickly,

19:35.642 --> 19:38.378
which means you're going
to meet more people,

19:38.445 --> 19:42.014
have more experiences,
learn more stuff.

19:42.081 --> 19:44.251
Speed makes you cleverer.

19:50.657 --> 19:52.759
Whereas,
if you drive a BMW i3,

19:52.825 --> 19:54.294
you're gonna
get everywhere late.

19:54.361 --> 19:56.329
You're gonna miss out
on things.

19:56.396 --> 20:01.000
You'll miss out on theatre,
culture, poetry.

20:01.067 --> 20:02.635
Love.

20:02.702 --> 20:05.705
You'll be a hollowed-out
husk of a man.

20:08.741 --> 20:11.344
"Connect your vehicle
and validate."

20:13.913 --> 20:16.883
What do they mean, "validate"?
I've already validated.

20:18.651 --> 20:21.488
And here we are.
My quest is at an end.

20:21.554 --> 20:23.990
I'm in good time.
All is well.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.758
And I was in for a treat,

20:25.825 --> 20:27.827
because joining
Roger Daltrey on stage

20:27.894 --> 20:31.531
was legendary guitarist
Wilko Johnson.

20:31.598 --> 20:33.099
The fabulous Wilko Johnson!

20:37.069 --> 20:41.374
"Station waiting for a charge
request from the vehicle.

20:41.441 --> 20:43.876
Initialisation. Charging."

20:44.977 --> 20:46.846
It's not charging.

20:51.318 --> 20:54.287
* Well, wait a minute, baby *

20:54.354 --> 20:56.255
* Well, whatcha gonna do? *

20:57.690 --> 21:01.361
OK, viewers,
here is where we're at.

21:01.428 --> 21:04.664
That last charging station
wasn't working.

21:04.731 --> 21:07.500
We have about 60 miles to go.

21:07.567 --> 21:10.337
So the answer is...

21:10.403 --> 21:11.804
eco driving.

21:11.871 --> 21:14.541
* Then I float on
Down the street *

21:15.675 --> 21:17.377
* Smiling at the faces

21:17.444 --> 21:18.845
* That I meet *

21:24.751 --> 21:26.453
I'm not switching it
into fast mode.

21:26.519 --> 21:28.020
It's too wasteful.

21:29.656 --> 21:33.426
* Then I'm going back home *

21:37.997 --> 21:41.634
It is 18 miles to the pub.

21:41.701 --> 21:45.037
I have 16 miles
of electric left.

21:46.473 --> 21:48.541
Is there anything else
I can turn off?

21:53.713 --> 21:57.183
Finally,
after much range anxiety...

21:57.249 --> 21:59.486
Roger Daltrey, here I come!

21:59.552 --> 22:00.753
...I made it.

22:07.927 --> 22:10.029
ROGER DALTREY: Thanks
for coming, and good night!

22:11.431 --> 22:12.732
Oh, cock!

22:15.234 --> 22:16.936
- So... Hang on.

22:19.406 --> 22:21.541
- Your car of the future...

22:21.608 --> 22:23.109
Two of the charging points

22:23.175 --> 22:25.812
you went to on that simple
journey, two were broken?

22:25.878 --> 22:27.747
Yes, that is very unusual.
But the point is,

22:27.814 --> 22:29.749
if I'd been
allowed to set off

22:29.816 --> 22:32.585
with a full electric charge
and a full little fuel tank,

22:32.652 --> 22:34.921
I could have got there--
admittedly a lot at 56mph--

22:34.987 --> 22:37.056
but I would have
done it with one stop.

22:37.123 --> 22:39.692
56mph. The future does
sound boring, James.

22:39.759 --> 22:42.261
And you still would have
missed the gig.

22:42.328 --> 22:43.930
That film is out of date.

22:43.996 --> 22:46.566
You don't get £5,000 from
the government any more.

22:46.633 --> 22:51.438
- You only get £4,500.

22:51.504 --> 22:53.039
I think what we've
done there is prove

22:53.105 --> 22:55.508
his car is not really
worth buying just yet.

22:55.575 --> 22:58.445
- Don't argue. It isn't.
It's not quite finished.
- Don't start again.

22:58.511 --> 23:00.713
Before we move on,
I want to tell you
a little bit more

23:00.780 --> 23:02.749
about that Volkswagen
system of texting.

23:02.815 --> 23:05.618
Cos I was using that
to send a text from my car

23:05.685 --> 23:07.587
the other day
to my youngest daughter,

23:07.654 --> 23:10.590
and I put four kisses
at the end, which is normal.

23:10.657 --> 23:14.494
And I said "X
This is what she got.

23:14.561 --> 23:16.696
- RICHARD: Oh, no!

23:16.763 --> 23:18.531
Oh, that is awkward!

23:19.832 --> 23:21.468
Oh!

23:21.534 --> 23:22.969
What did she say?

23:24.871 --> 23:28.274
- Oh, that is awkward.
- Say it, "X-X-X-X".

23:28.340 --> 23:29.476
That's what comes out.

23:29.509 --> 23:31.277
What sort of face did she pull

23:31.343 --> 23:33.312
when she got that
from her dad?

23:33.379 --> 23:34.547
Vomitous. Vomitous.

23:34.614 --> 23:35.882
We haven't spoken since.

23:35.948 --> 23:37.650
Katya, I'm sorry.
It was the car!

23:37.717 --> 23:39.652
- Move on!
- Yes, let's move on.

23:39.719 --> 23:43.956
It is now time for us
to visit the headquarters
of Chat & Co,

23:44.023 --> 23:47.193
who are, of course,
based on Conversation Street.

23:55.835 --> 23:58.270
Best one yet.
Anyway, we begin...

23:58.337 --> 24:00.607
We begin with Dubai, in fact.

24:00.673 --> 24:03.610
Cos the first time
I came here, which was...

24:03.676 --> 24:07.246
was only 20 years ago,
it was like a small village.

24:07.313 --> 24:09.181
I was the tallest thing in it.

24:10.517 --> 24:12.218
Now look at it.
It's unbelievable!

24:12.284 --> 24:15.522
- It is unbelievable, that.

24:15.588 --> 24:17.223
Do you know,
this shirt is older

24:17.289 --> 24:19.526
than everything you can
see out of that window.

24:19.526 --> 24:22.161
James, that shirt is older
than Carthage, mate.
Look at it.

24:22.228 --> 24:23.530
It is getting on a bit.

24:23.563 --> 24:24.897
Anyway, the point
I'm trying to make is,

24:24.964 --> 24:27.567
a few years ago,
when I first came here,

24:27.634 --> 24:30.870
there were virtually
no motoring laws at all.

24:30.937 --> 24:33.005
I woke up one morning
in my hotel--

24:33.072 --> 24:35.007
the hotel,
there was only one--

24:35.074 --> 24:36.108
in the hotel, thinking,

24:36.175 --> 24:38.911
"How did I get
back here last night?"

24:38.978 --> 24:41.080
Looked out of the window,
two wheel marks

24:41.147 --> 24:44.116
right over the ornamental
roundabout.

24:44.183 --> 24:47.353
And in the flowerbed,
my Range Rover.

24:47.419 --> 24:51.423
Jeremy, were you very tired
when you parked it?

24:51.558 --> 24:53.960
- I was off my face
with tiredness.
- OK. OK.

24:55.562 --> 24:57.797
- OK.
- Barely able to concentrate.

24:57.864 --> 24:59.331
But it was an extraordinary
free-for-all,

24:59.398 --> 25:01.033
which I bet it isn't now.

25:01.100 --> 25:02.268
It really isn't now.

25:02.334 --> 25:03.970
There are now very many rules

25:04.036 --> 25:06.072
and many stiff punishments.
I've got some of them here.

25:06.138 --> 25:08.575
Getting behind on the
repayments on your car loan,

25:08.641 --> 25:10.242
you go to prison.

25:10.309 --> 25:13.813
Making rude gestures at other
motorists, you go to prison.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.748
They're all just
the things I did

25:15.815 --> 25:17.183
when I was 17 every day.

25:17.249 --> 25:18.484
I quite approve of that.

25:18.585 --> 25:20.019
I'm just thinking
of all the things

25:20.086 --> 25:22.488
that you could be sent
to prison for in Britain

25:22.589 --> 25:24.290
if we ran it properly.

25:24.356 --> 25:26.258
A very good conversation,
isn't it? Here's one.

25:26.325 --> 25:28.595
Anyone who takes
more than five seconds

25:28.628 --> 25:30.963
between getting in their car
after filling up with petrol

25:31.030 --> 25:32.064
and driving off.

25:32.131 --> 25:33.600
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:33.666 --> 25:34.634
Definitely.

25:34.701 --> 25:35.835
Do you know what I mean by--

25:35.902 --> 25:37.770
- Definitely.

25:38.771 --> 25:39.806
- I know.

25:39.872 --> 25:41.407
Restaurant owners
who serve food

25:41.473 --> 25:42.709
on a piece of wood.

25:42.775 --> 25:44.110
Erm, It's not very
car-related,

25:44.176 --> 25:46.478
- No, it's not, but--

25:46.613 --> 25:48.480
Heston Blumenthal does that.

25:48.615 --> 25:49.916
Yes, he does. Exactly.

25:49.982 --> 25:51.984
Heston, if you're
watching... prison.

25:52.051 --> 25:53.620
- You, prison.

25:53.620 --> 25:55.354
I hate that--
food on a piece of wood.

25:55.421 --> 25:56.889
I tell you what I hate.

25:56.956 --> 25:58.858
I may have mentioned this
a couple of times before.

25:58.925 --> 26:00.660
And I think it should
be imprisonable.

26:00.727 --> 26:03.763
Any pilot who allows
the cabin of the plane

26:03.830 --> 26:05.632
to be more than 68°F.

26:05.698 --> 26:07.634
- Oh, God. Here we go.
- I'm with you on that.

26:07.667 --> 26:10.637
- All planes are
too hot these days.
- They are.

26:10.637 --> 26:13.405
It's just a standard moan
of yours.

26:13.472 --> 26:16.142
- I know. I know.
- Oh, God.

26:16.208 --> 26:18.210
We do have to fly together,
but I make every effort

26:18.277 --> 26:20.479
not to sit near Jeremy
Clarkson for a long flight.

26:20.546 --> 26:21.814
But eventually, you know,

26:21.881 --> 26:23.650
they turn the lights off
and it goes all dark,

26:23.716 --> 26:26.252
and after ten minutes
this voice over
in the blackness goes,

26:26.318 --> 26:29.656
"It's literally the hottest
place in the world!"

26:29.722 --> 26:32.959
- It is.

26:33.025 --> 26:35.795
If it gets any hotter,
I shall open a window!"

26:35.862 --> 26:38.665
I've heard all of this
so many times.

26:38.698 --> 26:40.566
Honestly, why do they do it?

26:40.667 --> 26:42.134
Why?
Are there any pilots here?

26:42.201 --> 26:44.470
- MAN: Yeah.

26:46.706 --> 26:49.976
Why do you boil us all?
Who do you fly with?

26:50.042 --> 26:51.678
- Etihad.
- Etihad.

26:51.678 --> 26:53.312
- Very warm.

26:53.379 --> 26:54.513
Well, there's a new rule.

26:54.580 --> 26:56.082
I'm telling you.
I'm warning you.

26:56.148 --> 26:58.450
- I'm seriously warning
you on this one.

26:58.517 --> 27:01.253
You land. If it's gone
over 68 in the cabin,

27:01.320 --> 27:04.356
straight to prison
for 50 years.

27:04.423 --> 27:07.093
Can I also say,
since you're in here--

27:07.159 --> 27:09.195
- We've gone off topic.
- It's worth pointing this out.

27:09.261 --> 27:11.063
Since you're in here,
when we're trying to sleep,

27:11.130 --> 27:12.732
don't tell us
the outside temperature

27:12.799 --> 27:14.366
is 57 below zero,

27:14.433 --> 27:15.735
cos we don't give a toss.

27:15.802 --> 27:17.336
Cos you can't open
the window anyway.

27:17.403 --> 27:19.371
We care about the temperature
in the plane.

27:20.840 --> 27:22.541
Just a few rules.

27:22.608 --> 27:23.810
Anyway, let's move it on.

27:23.876 --> 27:25.344
Shall we get back on
to some cars?

27:25.411 --> 27:26.713
Yeah, travel--

27:26.779 --> 27:28.748
Well, sort of
travel-related stuff. OK.

27:29.716 --> 27:30.750
I've got a photograph here

27:30.817 --> 27:32.018
of Britain's idea

27:32.084 --> 27:33.986
of infrastructure
investment, OK?

27:34.053 --> 27:36.622
This is in Cambridge.
It's erm...

27:38.190 --> 27:40.359
It's a T-junction
that they've designed,

27:40.426 --> 27:42.762
for reasons known
only to themselves,

27:42.829 --> 27:43.963
to look like a roundabout.

27:44.030 --> 27:45.464
Yeah, and let me guess.

27:45.531 --> 27:47.399
It cost 100 grand to do it?

27:47.466 --> 27:49.301
No, it was £500,000.

27:49.368 --> 27:51.303
- Of course it was, yeah.
- Half a million pounds

27:51.370 --> 27:53.039
they charged
the taxpayer for that.

27:53.105 --> 27:54.907
- For some paving slabs.
- Exactly.

27:54.974 --> 27:58.410
Anyway, Dubai's idea
of infrastructure investment

27:58.477 --> 27:59.746
is a little bit different,

27:59.779 --> 28:01.513
cos what they're planning
is this.

28:01.580 --> 28:03.549
It's called the Hyper Loop.

28:03.615 --> 28:04.951
It's like a tube train.

28:05.017 --> 28:07.019
And it'll go from Dubai
to Abu Dhabi,

28:07.086 --> 28:09.756
which is about 100 miles away,

28:09.822 --> 28:11.991
- in 12 minutes.
- 12 minutes!

28:12.058 --> 28:13.926
12 minutes. That's
how long that will take.

28:13.993 --> 28:15.627
So how fast does it go?

28:15.762 --> 28:17.663
500 miles an hour.

28:19.198 --> 28:21.033
I mean, that is just
breath-taking. It really is.

28:21.100 --> 28:23.335
- Did you say
it was 100 miles?
- Yeah.

28:23.402 --> 28:25.972
It's going 100 miles
at 500mph in 12 minutes.

28:26.038 --> 28:29.275
That means it accelerates
to 500mph instantly.

28:29.341 --> 28:30.910
- Mm.
- You're gonna have trouble

28:30.977 --> 28:32.678
holding on to the drinks
trolley in that.

28:32.779 --> 28:34.113
Ah! Ah!

28:34.180 --> 28:36.682
When it sets off,
you'll poo yourself.

28:36.783 --> 28:37.984
Then, when it stops,

28:38.050 --> 28:40.186
you'll wee yourself
at the end.

28:40.252 --> 28:41.954
It's a...
Are there any doctors here?

28:42.021 --> 28:43.856
I'm just saying.
It's not a medical argument.

28:43.923 --> 28:45.691
- I'm just saying.
- I'm not sure you're right.

28:45.792 --> 28:47.459
Well, think about Newton.

28:47.526 --> 28:49.328
If you set off,
you'll poo yourself, yes,

28:49.395 --> 28:51.297
but when it slows down,
you'll un-poo yourself,

28:51.363 --> 28:55.267
because everything has an
equal and opposite reaction.

28:55.334 --> 28:58.270
I'm roughly right, aren't I?
Any physicists here?

28:58.337 --> 29:00.206
- I think we should move on.
- Yeah.

29:01.941 --> 29:03.509
Right at the beginning
of the series,

29:03.575 --> 29:05.144
Richard Hammond and I came up

29:05.211 --> 29:06.813
with a rather brilliant
idea called...

29:08.480 --> 29:10.016
...Making James May

29:10.082 --> 29:12.284
Do Things He Doesn't
Want To Do.

29:12.351 --> 29:15.487
Yep. A brilliant idea
for an occasional feature.

29:15.554 --> 29:18.657
We made him go to a
doughnuting festival
in South Africa.

29:18.724 --> 29:20.359
- Yeah.
- He hated it.

29:20.426 --> 29:23.429
Then he thought
we'd forgotten about it.

29:23.495 --> 29:24.997
But we hadn't.

29:26.532 --> 29:28.234
JAMES: This is
the sort of countryside

29:28.300 --> 29:30.469
where people
can do nice things,

29:30.536 --> 29:33.405
like go for a walk
or a picnic.

29:34.606 --> 29:36.308
This, however,
is the sort of countryside

29:36.375 --> 29:39.278
that will be my home
for the day-- mud.

29:39.345 --> 29:41.180
Yes, I love mud.

29:41.247 --> 29:45.351
When I say I love mud,
I mean I hate mud.

29:45.417 --> 29:49.088
But the people with me here
today really do love it.

29:49.155 --> 29:51.490
They dream of the stuff.

29:51.557 --> 29:54.593
These people behind me
are called winchers,

29:54.660 --> 29:56.728
and what they like doing
is winching.

29:56.863 --> 29:59.598
They will drive,
deliberately,

29:59.665 --> 30:02.001
into something like
that puddle over there...

30:03.602 --> 30:07.306
..until they get stuck, and
then winch themselves out.

30:07.373 --> 30:09.842
When they've done that,
they'll find another one...

30:11.543 --> 30:13.112
and do it again, and again,

30:13.179 --> 30:15.447
and again, and again,
all day long.

30:17.850 --> 30:19.685
Winchers seem to be obsessed

30:19.751 --> 30:22.989
with making life
as difficult as possible.

30:23.055 --> 30:24.891
They put orienteering punches

30:24.957 --> 30:27.626
in almost unreachable
locations...

30:27.693 --> 30:31.663
and then try to get their
4x4s right up to them,

30:31.730 --> 30:36.835
as Seamus Doyle, my winch
buddy for the day, explained.

30:36.903 --> 30:38.270
There are 50 punches

30:38.337 --> 30:40.172
dotted around in different
parts of the site.

30:40.239 --> 30:42.474
We have a punch card
on the side of the vehicle.

30:42.541 --> 30:45.277
You've got to get this
punchcard to the punch.

30:45.344 --> 30:46.845
The punch will be on a string

30:46.913 --> 30:48.747
maybe 2ft long from
the tree, or maybe 1ft.

30:48.814 --> 30:50.149
So you've got to punch
the number.

30:50.216 --> 30:51.517
- Yes.

30:51.583 --> 30:53.019
When you get stuck,

30:53.085 --> 30:54.887
because you're
gonna get stuck...

30:54.954 --> 30:56.388
- Yes. Yeah, yeah.
- I have to get out

30:56.455 --> 30:57.990
and attach the winch
to a tree?

30:58.057 --> 30:59.325
Yes, you'll get out,

30:59.391 --> 31:01.027
and you'll get
your strap with you.

31:01.093 --> 31:02.962
The strap goes round the tree
to protect the tree.

31:03.029 --> 31:04.796
Then you bring your wincher
up to the tree,

31:04.931 --> 31:06.798
or whatever obstacle
we attach it to,

31:06.933 --> 31:08.634
and I'll operate the buttons.

31:08.700 --> 31:10.236
- Your English is excellent.
- Thank you.

31:10.302 --> 31:11.837
I've been practising
for a long time now.

31:11.938 --> 31:13.572
A lot of practice
has gone into that.

31:16.308 --> 31:18.244
As soon as the contest began,

31:18.310 --> 31:20.947
Seamus made it plain
that my new role in life

31:20.947 --> 31:23.415
was to be his winch bitch.

31:27.987 --> 31:29.288
SEAMUS: OK, got to go, go, go.

31:29.355 --> 31:30.957
- Yeah.

31:30.957 --> 31:32.858
Where the hell do you
think I'm gonna go?

31:32.959 --> 31:34.961
Go with the winch rope
to that tree over there.

31:34.961 --> 31:37.063
Oh, man!

31:37.129 --> 31:38.430
This is like being a...

31:39.298 --> 31:41.333
hippopotamus.

31:44.736 --> 31:46.672
OK, the clock is ticking.

31:46.738 --> 31:48.307
Having got our first punch,

31:48.374 --> 31:51.810
I was hoping the day might
get a bit less terrible.

31:51.877 --> 31:53.145
But it didn't.

31:56.515 --> 31:59.151
- Oh, man!

32:00.352 --> 32:01.553
Ow!

32:03.855 --> 32:05.224
I'm winching myself.

32:05.291 --> 32:06.358
Oh, that's much better.

32:06.425 --> 32:07.793
Well, I say
it's "much better",

32:07.859 --> 32:09.061
it's less shit.

32:11.163 --> 32:12.798
SEAMUS: Go!
We've got to make up time.

32:12.864 --> 32:14.666
- I've got a great idea.

32:14.733 --> 32:17.803
- Why don't you get out
and get the punch?
- No.

32:17.869 --> 32:19.338
Why do I
have to keep doing it?

32:19.405 --> 32:21.707
Me being the driver,
it doesn't work that way.

32:24.510 --> 32:26.612
Right, where next
on our lovely Sunday drive?

32:28.314 --> 32:31.483
- We're going down here.
- Don't be stupid.

32:31.550 --> 32:33.452
Ow!

32:33.519 --> 32:36.022
- We're stuck again.

32:36.055 --> 32:37.556
Get the winch out here,
buddy.

32:39.625 --> 32:40.626
See the tree over there?

32:40.692 --> 32:42.694
The place is full
of  trees.

32:42.761 --> 32:44.196
This is terrible.

32:44.263 --> 32:46.532
Christ!

32:48.534 --> 32:50.269
On the odd occasion
when I did manage

32:50.336 --> 32:52.038
a sit-down in the car,

32:52.071 --> 32:54.573
Seamus even managed
to ruin that.

32:59.045 --> 33:00.246
That wasn't even necessary.

33:00.312 --> 33:02.548
You just did that
to piss me off.

33:02.614 --> 33:04.050
No, no, no.

33:09.055 --> 33:10.489
We nearly made it, James.

33:10.556 --> 33:12.958
Yeah, but you didn't.
Now can I go home?

33:13.059 --> 33:15.361
Ground anchor over the hill.

33:18.697 --> 33:21.167
- I'll be here, OK, yeah.

33:21.233 --> 33:23.102
It's four hours
we've been in here now,

33:23.169 --> 33:24.736
and we've travelled,
in reality...

33:26.972 --> 33:28.507
...150 metres.

33:28.574 --> 33:31.077
All the things
I could be doing today

33:31.110 --> 33:33.112
that I would rather do,

33:33.179 --> 33:35.547
which include self-harm.

33:39.451 --> 33:42.754
Mercifully, the contest
eventually came to an end,

33:42.821 --> 33:46.758
and we were finally on our
way back to prize-giving.

33:46.825 --> 33:49.828
- The good news is
we're not gonna come last.

33:49.895 --> 33:52.598
Because one of the boys
broke down since ten o'clock.

33:52.664 --> 33:53.665
Lucky bastard.

33:53.732 --> 33:54.966
Oh, geez!

33:55.101 --> 33:56.468
I'm on it. I'm on it.

33:56.535 --> 33:58.170
No, you're gonna overdo it!

33:58.237 --> 34:01.173
- No, it's OK. You're OK.

34:01.240 --> 34:03.175
- JAMES: You idiot!
- SEAMUS: Your fault!

34:03.242 --> 34:05.877
JAMES: It was you driving,
you fool!

34:05.944 --> 34:07.879
It stinks down here.

34:07.946 --> 34:09.981
God! What is this stuff?

34:10.116 --> 34:12.017
SEAMUS: England.

34:12.118 --> 34:15.321
At last, we made it back
for the prize-giving.

34:18.290 --> 34:20.192
So, here's a quick sum-up.

34:20.259 --> 34:22.394
Er... At the end
of a seven-hour day,

34:22.461 --> 34:26.665
I've... been stuck
50-something times.

34:26.732 --> 34:28.500
Erm... I've fallen over,

34:28.567 --> 34:31.670
I haven't actually
been counting,
something like 25 times.

34:31.737 --> 34:34.140
I've nearly drowned
in three puddles.

34:34.206 --> 34:36.175
And that wouldn't be so bad

34:36.242 --> 34:38.144
if I was gonna win a winch
or a winch cover

34:38.210 --> 34:40.146
or a new piece of rope
or something like that,

34:40.146 --> 34:41.613
but, in fact, in the rollover,

34:41.680 --> 34:44.416
we tore the punchcard off,
which means, technically,

34:44.483 --> 34:47.553
we've got to start again
from the beginning.

34:47.619 --> 34:50.156
But I've decided to go
and drown myself instead.

34:54.160 --> 34:56.162
- I like Seamus a lot.
- Yeah, I like him.

34:56.162 --> 34:58.730
- Seamus is my new
best friend.
- Yeah, definitely.

34:58.797 --> 35:01.032
- Ruined James May.
- We need to do
a lot more of those.

35:01.167 --> 35:03.569
- Yeah, a lot more.
A lot more.
- Many more.

35:03.635 --> 35:07.606
So, James, was there any
aspect of that that you liked?

35:07.673 --> 35:08.874
- No.
- Good.

35:08.940 --> 35:10.842
So, moving on, it's time now

35:10.909 --> 35:13.712
to play Celebrity Brain Crash.

35:20.752 --> 35:22.688
- That doesn't get any better.
- It doesn't!

35:22.754 --> 35:25.524
Anyway, our guest today

35:25.591 --> 35:29.995
is a shining star from
the world of Formula One.

35:30.061 --> 35:31.530
He's also
a very brave young man,

35:31.597 --> 35:34.032
because, even though
he is fully aware

35:34.099 --> 35:35.467
of all of the calamities

35:35.534 --> 35:37.303
that have befallen
all the other celebrities

35:37.369 --> 35:39.538
that have tried
to come to our tent,

35:39.605 --> 35:43.675
he's elected to arrive
in a hovercraft.

35:43.742 --> 35:45.877
Ladies and gentlemen,
Daniel Ricciardo!

35:48.480 --> 35:50.516
- JEREMY: And there he is.
- RICHARD: There he is.

35:50.582 --> 35:52.218
JEREMY:
Putting his helmet on.

35:52.251 --> 35:54.553
That's a wise move,
I think. A wise move.

35:54.620 --> 35:58.357
JAMES: I genuinely, genuinely
like Daniel Ricciardo,

35:58.424 --> 36:01.026
because he is
a truly nice man.

36:01.092 --> 36:02.428
He's a truly nice man,

36:02.494 --> 36:04.496
and he's also extremely
happy and cheerful.

36:04.563 --> 36:06.765
JEREMY: I just... Well, I know
from personal experience,

36:06.832 --> 36:08.767
hovercrafts
are tricky to control.

36:08.834 --> 36:11.337
RICHARD: Yeah, Jeremy,
he's a Formula One driver.

36:11.403 --> 36:13.639
- He's got this covered.
- No, but it's windy.

36:13.705 --> 36:16.007
Oh, here he comes.
Here he is, arriving now.

36:16.074 --> 36:19.077
- He's fine with that.
- Wrestling with the controls
and doing well.

36:19.144 --> 36:20.479
- Yeah.
- Oh, he's overshot.

36:20.546 --> 36:23.582
He's overshot a bit there.
Oh, dear.

36:24.816 --> 36:26.318
RICHARD: Oh, no!

36:26.385 --> 36:28.287
Oh, there's been...
No, there's been a... No.

36:28.354 --> 36:31.423
Oh, God!
He's going in the fan!
He's going in the fan!

36:31.490 --> 36:32.958
- Oh, no!

36:35.394 --> 36:36.595
Oh, that...

36:44.303 --> 36:46.572
The helmet...

36:46.638 --> 36:49.975
The helmet has now
thankfully jammed
the motor with his head.

36:50.041 --> 36:51.343
Yeah, it's too late.

36:53.178 --> 36:55.281
Erm...

36:55.281 --> 36:57.883
- Does that mean
he's not coming on, then?

36:57.949 --> 37:01.019
Well, James, he's been
liquidised and now he's
all over the window,

37:01.086 --> 37:02.621
so, no, he's not.

37:02.688 --> 37:04.523
Yeah, he's not in the tent
so much as on it.

37:04.590 --> 37:06.725
Yeah. Uh...

37:06.792 --> 37:09.495
- We've got to do something.

37:09.561 --> 37:11.830
Well, I'm gonna clean
that off, if you don't mind.

37:11.897 --> 37:13.799
It is distracting
and off-putting.

37:13.865 --> 37:15.301
How do we fill the time?

37:15.334 --> 37:16.602
It's all right,
because I thought

37:16.668 --> 37:18.337
something like this
might happen.

37:18.404 --> 37:19.638
So when we arrived
last night,

37:19.705 --> 37:21.540
I went out and I made
a little film.

37:21.607 --> 37:23.309
Thank God for that.
What was it?

37:23.375 --> 37:24.910
- Well, let's just...
- We'll cover this up.

37:24.976 --> 37:27.613
- I'd like to talk
to you now--

37:27.679 --> 37:29.748
- No, we need
to tighten the shot.
- Good idea.

37:29.815 --> 37:32.751
Tighten it on him.
Just our faces.

37:32.818 --> 37:35.086
Concentrate on me
and what I'm saying,

37:35.153 --> 37:36.388
and not on anything else

37:36.455 --> 37:38.223
that you might be
tempted to look at.

37:38.324 --> 37:40.225
Erm... Now, the Porsche 918,

37:40.326 --> 37:43.595
earlier in this series
of programmes
we saw it in action

37:43.662 --> 37:45.331
and proved that it is
the ultimate

37:45.397 --> 37:47.799
of the hypercar Holy Trinity

37:47.866 --> 37:50.035
when we put it against
the Ferrari and the McLaren.

37:50.101 --> 37:51.337
But I've always wondered,

37:51.403 --> 37:53.004
"How would it fare
in a straight race

37:53.071 --> 37:54.440
against a Bugatti Veyron?"

37:54.506 --> 37:57.343
And as we are in
the home of the hypercar,

37:57.343 --> 37:58.844
this is the place
to find out.

37:58.910 --> 38:01.547
Yeah. Now, tight on me.
Are we tight? Good. Erm...

38:01.613 --> 38:02.881
This is, then...

38:02.948 --> 38:04.450
This is a... It's a race

38:04.516 --> 38:06.585
between the future
and the past.

38:06.652 --> 38:08.119
Second time this evening.

38:08.186 --> 38:09.421
Yeah, much like your film,

38:09.488 --> 38:10.956
only this one is exciting.

38:32.411 --> 38:33.545
So, here we are.

38:33.612 --> 38:34.980
The grand old man
of performance

38:35.046 --> 38:37.449
coming out one more time
to defend his title

38:37.516 --> 38:39.385
against one of
the young upstarts.

38:39.451 --> 38:41.252
Here's how it all
pans out on paper.

38:41.387 --> 38:44.623
Bugatti Veyron:
0-60, 2.5 seconds.

38:44.690 --> 38:46.157
Power-to-weight ratio:

38:46.224 --> 38:49.127
523 brake horsepower
per tonne.

38:49.194 --> 38:52.631
The 918: 0-60, 2.6 seconds,

38:52.698 --> 38:53.865
but a power-to-weight ratio

38:53.932 --> 38:57.469
of 535 brake horsepower
per tonne.

38:57.536 --> 39:00.238
However, as we learned
when we raced the 918

39:00.305 --> 39:03.141
against the LaFerrari
and the P1 in our first show,

39:03.208 --> 39:06.478
hard facts like that
count for nothing.

39:06.545 --> 39:08.680
In the end,
it's all down to this.

39:13.318 --> 39:14.720
And I'm ready to race.

39:17.022 --> 39:17.989
Actually...

39:20.158 --> 39:21.126
Yeah.

39:28.734 --> 39:30.135
Last bit of dead skin.

39:35.841 --> 39:38.677
OK.
Launch control: race mode.

39:41.312 --> 39:43.482
Representing the future here.

40:02.534 --> 40:05.771
I think...
if I can just stay ahead...

40:10.241 --> 40:12.143
This is going to be so close!

40:13.745 --> 40:15.814
The future is gonna take it!

40:18.484 --> 40:21.820
So sorry, Veyron,
but your crown is gone.

40:21.887 --> 40:22.854
Wow!

40:24.456 --> 40:26.091
What a device this is.

40:29.294 --> 40:31.663
I was gonna call it a day
at that, obviously,

40:31.730 --> 40:35.033
but there's a bloke here
wants to race his Nissan.

40:37.402 --> 40:38.737
It's a bit
embarrassing, really,

40:38.804 --> 40:40.506
but you don't want
to upset the locals.

40:40.572 --> 40:43.709
So, OK, race is on.
Here we go.

40:47.579 --> 40:48.814
Let's get this over with.

40:48.880 --> 40:51.550
Do race, apologise, move on.

41:01.560 --> 41:02.728
What?

41:04.162 --> 41:07.165
He's pulling away
in a Nissan Patrol!

41:18.176 --> 41:21.046
What... just... happened?

41:29.655 --> 41:30.956
So, hang on a minute.

41:31.990 --> 41:33.725
At the beginning
of this series,

41:33.792 --> 41:37.262
we bigged up
the hypercar Holy Trinity

41:37.328 --> 41:38.764
as the three greatest cars

41:38.830 --> 41:41.366
ever to have been conceived
and invented.

41:41.432 --> 41:43.735
- Yeah.
- And the fastest
of all of them...

41:43.802 --> 41:47.405
- Yes.
- ...was beaten
by a Datsun van.

41:48.574 --> 41:50.108
Yes. Yes.

41:50.175 --> 41:51.843
What the hell engine
did it have?

41:51.910 --> 41:55.981
Well, it turns out
it's got 1,900 horsepower.

41:56.047 --> 41:58.449
- What were Porsche
thinking of?
- I know.

41:58.584 --> 41:59.951
Back to the drawing
boards, lads,

42:00.018 --> 42:02.020
- and we'll gloss over that.
- Exactly right.

42:02.087 --> 42:05.023
Your embarrassing
mistake, Porsche.

42:05.090 --> 42:07.626
Now, I'd like to make
a confession, actually,
and it's this.

42:07.693 --> 42:12.063
- I've never been able
to drift properly.

42:12.130 --> 42:14.332
It's just...
I know, just ignore him.

42:14.399 --> 42:16.134
Nothing to see.
Nothing to see.

42:16.201 --> 42:17.435
Nothing to see here.

42:17.502 --> 42:19.004
It's just a man doing his job.

42:20.105 --> 42:22.473
I've never been able
to drift properly.

42:22.608 --> 42:24.743
I can provoke a car,
you know, into a slide,

42:24.810 --> 42:26.077
but I couldn't hold it there.

42:26.144 --> 42:27.646
It would always just
spin off and crash.

42:27.713 --> 42:29.314
No, exactly. I mean,

42:29.380 --> 42:31.216
everything you've ever seen
in the past of him drifting

42:31.282 --> 42:34.052
has been done with smoke,
mirrors, clever editing

42:34.119 --> 42:36.254
and, let's be honest,
stunt drivers.

42:36.321 --> 42:38.957
So I decided when we
started making Grand Tour

42:39.024 --> 42:40.726
that I had to go out
and change that,

42:40.792 --> 42:43.261
and learn
how to do it properly.

42:49.000 --> 42:50.501
One option would be to go

42:50.636 --> 42:53.639
to a supermarket car park
on a Saturday night,

42:53.672 --> 42:56.742
but instead
I came here to France.

43:02.147 --> 43:04.182
Specifically,
to the top-secret

43:04.249 --> 43:05.817
Ladoux test centre,

43:05.884 --> 43:08.086
where Michelin
develops its tyres.

43:10.756 --> 43:13.759
There are several reasons
why I'm here.

43:13.825 --> 43:15.661
First, they have the space.

43:17.863 --> 43:21.767
Twenty-seven miles
of test tracks and skid pans.

43:24.102 --> 43:27.572
Second, if you want
to understand drifting,

43:27.673 --> 43:29.675
you have to understand tyres,

43:29.675 --> 43:32.043
and this place
is a tyre temple.

43:40.919 --> 43:42.888
Third, and most important,

43:42.954 --> 43:45.356
if you want to know
about tyres,

43:45.423 --> 43:47.158
you have to know
how to drift,

43:47.225 --> 43:50.028
and that is where
this chap comes in.

43:54.900 --> 43:57.268
His name is Jérôme Haslin,

43:57.335 --> 43:59.971
and he is Michelin's
chief tyre tester

44:00.038 --> 44:03.374
for BMW, Porsche,
Ferrari and Bugatti.

44:04.876 --> 44:07.012
Rubber compound
runs through his veins.

44:07.078 --> 44:09.314
He is a Zen master of grip,

44:09.380 --> 44:11.482
a Kung Fu Panda of drifting,

44:11.549 --> 44:13.985
and I am to be his new pupil.

44:37.108 --> 44:40.278
This is what he means
by "over the limit".

44:40.345 --> 44:43.749
He uses power to kick
the back of the car
out of line...

44:43.782 --> 44:47.285
and then a delicate balance
of throttle and steering

44:47.352 --> 44:48.820
to keep it there.

44:51.022 --> 44:53.558
Your steering-wheel
technique is amazing.

44:53.624 --> 44:56.061
JÉRÔME: I play a lot
with the gas pedal.

44:59.297 --> 45:02.033
And if you work a lot
with the gas,

45:02.100 --> 45:04.002
you have nothing
to do with the steering.

45:04.069 --> 45:06.404
You can do all with one hand,
like this.

45:06.471 --> 45:09.775
- So you're steering the car
with your right foot?
- Yes.

45:13.111 --> 45:15.146
Jérôme, this is brilliant
that I learn how to do this

45:15.213 --> 45:17.515
because you read those lists
on the Internet

45:17.582 --> 45:20.318
of things that women
appreciate in a man,
don't you?

45:20.385 --> 45:23.121
And there's always honesty,
integrity,

45:23.188 --> 45:25.490
loyalty, fidelity, drifting.

45:25.556 --> 45:27.492
It's always there.

45:27.558 --> 45:32.063
On that note, it was time
for me to begin my lesson.

45:32.130 --> 45:34.699
You can pull up the seat
more.

45:34.800 --> 45:36.935
- More close
to the steering wheel.

45:37.002 --> 45:38.369
What are you trying to say?

45:41.606 --> 45:43.374
OK. So, here we go.

45:43.441 --> 45:46.878
Provoking oversteer, coming
off, and then feeding...

45:46.945 --> 45:48.914
No, and then going round
in a small circle.

45:51.482 --> 45:55.453
My challenge was to drift
the car for one complete lap.

45:56.554 --> 45:58.289
Gas, oversteer.

45:58.356 --> 46:01.392
- Release gas, counter-steer.
- Release gas, counter-steer.

46:01.459 --> 46:02.861
- Oh, I've spun!
- OK.

46:04.695 --> 46:06.431
JÉRÔME: Gas, gas, gas, gas!

46:06.497 --> 46:07.833
RICHARD: Oh, bugger!

46:10.836 --> 46:12.537
Soon, the constant spinning

46:12.603 --> 46:15.373
started to have an effect
on my teacher.

46:16.541 --> 46:18.944
A little bit more power. No.

46:20.711 --> 46:21.947
Yeah, off the gas.

46:25.416 --> 46:28.419
This is weird. I thought
this would be so easy.

46:31.122 --> 46:34.860
- OK, is it possible
to take air
- Yeah.

46:34.893 --> 46:37.328
Because I will be ill
in two minutes.

46:38.763 --> 46:40.165
RICHARD: Is this going badly?

46:43.869 --> 46:47.305
While Jérôme went off to say
hello to his breakfast...

46:49.774 --> 46:53.411
I continued plugging away.

46:53.478 --> 46:55.546
Begin power and begin
counter-steer immediately.

46:55.613 --> 46:56.948
Now hold it.

46:59.350 --> 47:01.953
And soon,
it started to click.

47:04.355 --> 47:08.093
What I am doing is drifting.
There's no denying that.

47:08.960 --> 47:11.562
Oh, yes! Yes!

47:11.629 --> 47:14.365
I've connected the steering
wheel to my feet.

47:15.233 --> 47:16.801
This is a whole new feeling.

47:16.902 --> 47:18.904
This is not reacting
to a slide,

47:18.904 --> 47:21.339
this is deliberately
provoking it

47:21.406 --> 47:23.408
and keeping it
right on the point.

47:27.712 --> 47:30.248
Ha-ha, Jérôme, you French...

47:30.315 --> 47:32.817
drift-and-ski-instructing
dude, you.

47:32.918 --> 47:34.252
He'll be impressed with this.

47:35.653 --> 47:36.787
And he was,

47:36.922 --> 47:38.689
so we immediately progressed

47:38.756 --> 47:41.259
to the next level.

47:41.326 --> 47:42.928
Just before we start, Jérôme,

47:42.928 --> 47:45.931
are you going to make this
look really annoyingly easy?

47:45.964 --> 47:47.298
Yeah, you are. OK.

47:48.699 --> 47:49.935
He did.

47:51.002 --> 47:53.238
This is called
transitioning--

47:53.304 --> 47:56.707
drifting the car one way
and then the other.

47:56.774 --> 48:00.011
Get it right
and it's almost balletic.

48:06.551 --> 48:08.419
That is beautiful.

48:08.486 --> 48:11.656
From that to that,
seamlessly.

48:13.959 --> 48:17.362
Which, sadly, couldn't be
said of what followed.

48:17.428 --> 48:19.297
- Brake!

48:27.172 --> 48:28.339
Brake, brake, brake.

48:30.175 --> 48:31.476
RICHARD: Oh, bollocks.

48:35.080 --> 48:37.248
Does BMW know
we're using their car?

48:37.315 --> 48:39.284
- I don't think so.
- OK.

48:40.986 --> 48:42.320
Eventually, though...

48:45.991 --> 48:47.125
Yeah!

48:55.033 --> 48:56.667
Yes, that was a transition.

48:56.734 --> 48:58.203
Your first.

49:01.639 --> 49:05.643
By the end of the day,
I really had got it mastered.

49:07.112 --> 49:09.747
I'd become,
for the first time,

49:09.814 --> 49:11.349
a driving god.

49:17.922 --> 49:19.457
It really is...

49:19.524 --> 49:22.193
It really is the most
amazing feeling

49:22.260 --> 49:23.928
when you get just the right
amount of power

49:24.029 --> 49:25.496
to spin the back wheels,

49:25.563 --> 49:27.698
but not so much that you
don't spin the whole car,

49:27.765 --> 49:29.534
and you hold it on the edge.

49:29.600 --> 49:32.037
No, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
He came back from France,

49:32.037 --> 49:34.139
where he'd spent one day

49:34.205 --> 49:35.540
saying,
"Well, I'm brilliant now."

49:35.606 --> 49:36.707
Yeah, well, I am.

49:36.774 --> 49:37.875
Well, now, I'm sorry.

49:37.942 --> 49:40.211
Hammond, it took me ten years

49:40.278 --> 49:42.047
to learn how to drift a car.

49:42.047 --> 49:43.281
- Mm-hm. Mm-hm.
- Ten--

49:43.348 --> 49:44.749
But because I'm not an ape,

49:44.815 --> 49:47.285
I did it in one day.

49:47.352 --> 49:48.619
- You didn't!
- Well, I did.

49:48.686 --> 49:50.121
Look, anyway,
it doesn't matter.

49:50.188 --> 49:53.158
To find out
if he was a driving god,

49:53.224 --> 49:55.293
Clarkson and I arranged
for Richard Hammond

49:55.360 --> 49:58.463
to take part
in a drifting contest.

49:58.529 --> 50:00.398
Yeah, we did. We fixed up
the car for him.

50:00.465 --> 50:02.167
We fixed up the competitors.

50:02.233 --> 50:03.734
We did everything.

50:10.308 --> 50:12.077
RICHARD: This is the car.

50:12.143 --> 50:14.979
It started out
as a Nissan 200SX,

50:15.046 --> 50:20.318
but it's been fitted with
a 700-horsepower 6.2L V8

50:20.385 --> 50:22.720
and a modified
steering rack,

50:22.787 --> 50:24.655
so it can do this.

50:47.678 --> 50:51.516
Its owner, a chap called
Steve "Baggsy" Biagioni,

50:51.582 --> 50:53.818
said that, to prepare
for my competition,

50:53.884 --> 50:58.123
I needed to put some melons
on a row of traffic cones.

50:58.189 --> 50:59.624
What are we doing with these?

50:59.690 --> 51:01.592
Can I put mine down?
They're really heavy.

51:01.659 --> 51:03.194
Well, in a drifting
competition,

51:03.261 --> 51:04.429
you have what's
called clipping points.

51:04.495 --> 51:06.297
- Yes.
- So these would be

51:06.364 --> 51:08.133
determined
points on the track

51:08.133 --> 51:10.801
made by the judges as to where
they want to see the car.

51:10.868 --> 51:14.705
- Our clipping points
are melons?
- Melons, yes.

51:14.772 --> 51:16.241
My orders were to get

51:16.307 --> 51:18.209
as close to the melons
as possible

51:18.276 --> 51:21.379
without hitting them.

51:21.446 --> 51:22.947
We're just gonna concentrate

51:23.013 --> 51:25.650
on looking for the middle
of the track, yeah,

51:25.716 --> 51:28.586
and aim the back of the car
near them melons.

51:28.653 --> 51:29.620
OK.

51:31.256 --> 51:33.224
Right, when you're ready,
go for it.

51:40.231 --> 51:41.532
Bollocks!

51:44.369 --> 51:47.238
Having not really mastered
this at all...

51:48.239 --> 51:51.176
Oh, shit!

51:51.242 --> 51:52.743
...it was time for the event

51:52.810 --> 51:57.382
organised by Clarkson
and May to begin.

51:57.448 --> 52:00.251
What they've done
is told me to report here,

52:00.318 --> 52:01.486
Rockingham Raceway,

52:01.552 --> 52:03.020
where they've arranged for me

52:03.188 --> 52:04.455
to take on two drifters

52:04.522 --> 52:06.724
in some competitive drifting.

52:08.693 --> 52:14.098
The course was a series of
classic transitional bends...

52:14.199 --> 52:15.600
strategically peppered

52:15.666 --> 52:17.335
with the dreaded
clipping points.

52:19.837 --> 52:23.974
Baggsy was on hand to explain
how the scoring worked.

52:24.041 --> 52:26.977
The main thing about drifting
is that it's a judged sport,

52:27.044 --> 52:30.748
and the judges have placed
the clipping points where
they want to see the car.

52:30.815 --> 52:34.419
So that'll either be the rear
or the front of the car.

52:34.485 --> 52:35.953
The closer you get
to the clipping points,

52:36.020 --> 52:38.389
the more points
you're gonna get awarded.

52:38.456 --> 52:40.225
But the key is
to not hit them.

52:40.258 --> 52:41.492
If you can brush them,

52:41.559 --> 52:42.893
you're gonna get
maximum points.

52:42.960 --> 52:44.061
When I say "brush",

52:44.128 --> 52:45.230
I mean don't knock them over.

52:45.296 --> 52:46.297
If you can be

52:46.364 --> 52:47.365
within half a metre,

52:47.432 --> 52:49.934
you're gonna score high.

52:50.000 --> 52:52.703
I'd also score points
for holding the car

52:52.770 --> 52:55.306
in as impressive a drift
as possible.

52:56.774 --> 52:58.376
You've got to keep
the throttle in

52:58.443 --> 53:00.845
so that you maintain
the drift with good angle,

53:00.911 --> 53:03.381
and that's only up to you
about how much steering input

53:03.448 --> 53:05.250
and how much accelerator
you put in.

53:06.651 --> 53:09.420
The cars are designed
to run at almost 90°.

53:09.487 --> 53:11.589
They've got massive amounts
of steering angle,

53:11.656 --> 53:13.658
so you can drive
on the end of your rack.

53:13.724 --> 53:16.160
OK. So I don't get
awarded points

53:16.261 --> 53:17.662
for how quickly
I do the whole thing?

53:17.728 --> 53:19.096
No, that doesn't
come into it.

53:19.163 --> 53:22.367
It's all about angle, line,

53:22.433 --> 53:24.369
and how much
you excite everybody.

53:24.435 --> 53:26.671
It's judged showing off,
isn't it?

53:26.737 --> 53:28.873
- Basically, yeah.
- Yeah, OK.

53:31.008 --> 53:33.711
As my car was prepped
for the big event,

53:33.778 --> 53:36.414
the competitors,
organised by my colleagues,

53:36.481 --> 53:38.983
finally arrived.

53:39.049 --> 53:43.321
And they weren't
what I was expecting.

53:43.388 --> 53:44.889
It seems James and Jeremy

53:44.955 --> 53:48.025
want their old mate
to do well after all,

53:48.092 --> 53:50.661
because, unless I'm mistaken,

53:50.728 --> 53:54.299
it would appear
that I'm up against a child

53:54.299 --> 53:56.334
and a man with no arms.

53:59.036 --> 54:00.004
OK.

54:01.306 --> 54:02.540
That's my competition.

54:07.111 --> 54:08.813
With the judges in position,

54:08.879 --> 54:12.383
it was time for
the contest to begin.

54:12.450 --> 54:15.219
First up was
the disabled gentleman,

54:15.320 --> 54:17.688
Bartek OstaBowski
from Poland.

54:19.056 --> 54:20.591
The fact is, Bartek...

54:22.727 --> 54:25.730
is deficient
in the arms department
to the tune of two.

54:25.796 --> 54:28.032
When I say "deficient",
I don't mean deficient.

54:28.098 --> 54:29.099
He... He has...

54:29.166 --> 54:31.068
He has no arms... at all.

54:31.135 --> 54:33.571
So, I mean, it's brilliant
that he's having a go.

54:33.638 --> 54:35.706
Really, it's tremendous.

54:35.773 --> 54:38.976
Bartek, who lost his arms
in a motorcycling accident,

54:39.043 --> 54:42.613
overcomes his disability
by steering with his foot

54:42.680 --> 54:45.350
and changing gear
with his shoulder.

54:46.884 --> 54:50.921
And unfortunately for me,
he's rather good at it.

55:09.173 --> 55:10.475
How is he...?

55:35.232 --> 55:36.434
Good for you!

55:36.501 --> 55:37.935
Really good for you!

55:38.002 --> 55:40.805
Yeah! Good!

55:40.871 --> 55:42.873
This was nice.

55:42.940 --> 55:45.242
Out of a maximum
of 30 points,

55:45.309 --> 55:48.813
the judges awarded Bartek
a score of 22.

55:50.581 --> 55:53.551
And then it was the turn
of the child,

55:53.618 --> 55:56.787
Conor Shanahan,
who's just 13 years old.

56:00.290 --> 56:02.527
Here we go. Primary-school
drifting with Conor.

56:02.593 --> 56:04.128
He'll go ten yards, get bored,

56:04.194 --> 56:05.630
and start crying
for his mummy.

56:07.632 --> 56:08.799
However...

56:17.908 --> 56:18.876
Whoo!

56:23.948 --> 56:27.752
He's 13! I mean,
he's five years off voting!

56:57.882 --> 57:00.551
The judges awarded
the cocky little sh...

57:00.618 --> 57:03.521
talented young man
a score of 27.

57:05.255 --> 57:07.492
And then it was my turn.

57:08.358 --> 57:10.360
Right, this is it.

57:10.495 --> 57:11.762
My shot at glory.

57:13.531 --> 57:14.899
Everything I'd learned

57:14.965 --> 57:17.502
would be brought
into sharp focus.

57:17.502 --> 57:18.769
Gas, gas, gas, gas, gas!

57:20.237 --> 57:23.040
BAGGSY:
The key is to not hit them.

57:23.107 --> 57:26.143
RICHARD: Here,
in the moment of truth...

57:28.946 --> 57:31.015
I'm waiting for amber.
There it is.

57:31.081 --> 57:32.049
Amber and...

57:39.356 --> 57:41.926
Forward to glory
for Grand Tour!

57:43.327 --> 57:44.529
Clutch kick!

58:09.620 --> 58:10.788
Oh, shit!

58:11.656 --> 58:14.324
Oh! And across the line!

58:14.391 --> 58:15.560
Yeah!

58:15.560 --> 58:16.927
Yeah, I clipped the flag.

58:16.994 --> 58:19.129
That's probably
an extra point, I imagine.

58:19.196 --> 58:20.565
Erm... I'll just restart,

58:20.565 --> 58:23.400
because I wanted to stop
there for a minute.

58:23.467 --> 58:25.169
Yep. Oh, I've stalled again.

58:29.006 --> 58:31.576
Yep. Yep.

58:32.476 --> 58:33.578
Thank you.

58:33.611 --> 58:35.980
So...

58:36.046 --> 58:39.584
Hold on.
What was your final score?

58:39.650 --> 58:42.052
- Two.

58:42.119 --> 58:43.120
- Yes.

58:43.187 --> 58:44.121
You were useless!

58:44.188 --> 58:46.256
No, listen, gentlemen.
Gentlemen.

58:46.323 --> 58:48.025
I have to say, I'm delighted

58:48.092 --> 58:50.861
that you now have, albeit
limited, drifting skills,

58:50.928 --> 58:52.997
cos it means
I have a playmate,

58:53.063 --> 58:58.268
as this short montage from
the last 12 weeks shows.

59:19.690 --> 59:23.861
Yeah. Yeah. On the edge.

59:23.928 --> 59:26.496
Now, I admit...
I admit it's not...

59:26.631 --> 59:28.065
It's not important work,
really.

59:28.132 --> 59:29.834
No, we haven't actually
cured anything.

59:29.900 --> 59:31.268
No, we haven't brought peace

59:31.335 --> 59:33.170
to troubled parts
of the world or any of that.

59:33.237 --> 59:34.639
No, but it is a job.

59:34.639 --> 59:36.841
It is a job,
and we're very good at it.

59:36.907 --> 59:38.709
- No, you're not
very good at it.
- We are.

59:38.776 --> 59:40.745
No, well, I've got some items

59:40.811 --> 59:42.847
from the unseen footage bin

59:42.913 --> 59:44.749
that would suggest otherwise.

59:44.815 --> 59:46.651
Unfortunately,
we don't have time for that.

59:46.684 --> 59:48.052
Sadly. Cor, that's a pity!

59:48.118 --> 59:49.654
No, no. You're wrong.
We do have time.

59:49.687 --> 59:51.188
Who wants to see that?
Nobody.

59:53.791 --> 59:56.026
OK. Let's roll it.

59:56.093 --> 59:57.762
Here is Richard Hammond.

59:57.828 --> 1:00:00.297
Can he contain
170 horsepower?

1:00:00.364 --> 1:00:02.933
- No, it would appear not.

1:00:03.000 --> 1:00:04.935
Jeremy Clarkson,
Porsche 911 GT3.

1:00:05.002 --> 1:00:07.838
Oh, there we go.
You see, I have actually
made a mess of that.

1:00:07.905 --> 1:00:10.107
Yes, you have, and we saw it.

1:00:10.174 --> 1:00:12.042
Richard Hammond negotiating
Your Name Here.

1:00:12.109 --> 1:00:13.644
Your name, in this instance,

1:00:13.711 --> 1:00:15.145
is Total Bell End,
it would appear.

1:00:16.246 --> 1:00:18.615
Clarkson,
has he tamed the GT3?

1:00:18.683 --> 1:00:19.684
No!

1:00:19.750 --> 1:00:21.719
I've had an idea. Hold on.

1:00:21.786 --> 1:00:23.187
I bet it wasn't this.

1:00:26.523 --> 1:00:28.092
Watch this. Ready?

1:00:28.158 --> 1:00:29.493
Never say that.

1:00:29.559 --> 1:00:32.229
Even if you're just in
a four-door family saloon,

1:00:32.296 --> 1:00:33.831
it's disastrous.

1:00:33.898 --> 1:00:36.266
Right, Richard Hammond,
has he got it yet?

1:00:36.333 --> 1:00:39.536
Yes, I think he has.
Yes! Yes!

1:00:39.603 --> 1:00:42.339
- No. No, he hasn't got it.

1:00:42.406 --> 1:00:44.709
- I tell you what--
- Nobody's perfect!

1:00:44.775 --> 1:00:49.279
- A couple of moments.
- Yeah, just two or three,
four, five.

1:00:49.346 --> 1:00:50.981
Don't worry. Don't worry.

1:00:51.048 --> 1:00:52.449
In the future, we'll just get

1:00:52.516 --> 1:00:54.518
an armless man and small boy
to do those bits.

1:00:54.584 --> 1:00:56.186
Shut up! Shut up!

1:00:56.253 --> 1:00:58.255
As opposed to a fat man
and a small boy.

1:00:58.322 --> 1:01:00.090
Anyway...

1:01:00.157 --> 1:01:01.859
Listen, on that
terrible disappointment,

1:01:01.926 --> 1:01:04.261
it is time to end
not just the show

1:01:04.328 --> 1:01:05.529
but the entire series.

1:01:05.595 --> 1:01:06.831
Thank you so much
for watching.

1:01:06.897 --> 1:01:08.598
Thank you all for coming.

1:01:08.733 --> 1:01:10.634
And we'll see you
later in the year

1:01:10.735 --> 1:01:12.469
for more of this.

1:01:12.536 --> 1:01:13.738
Take care. Goodbye.
