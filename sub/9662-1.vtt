[No audible speech]

02:10.564 --> 02:12.333
How did it happen?

02:12.400 --> 02:15.703
You knocked me up.
That's how it happened.

02:16.937 --> 02:19.106
You said you were safe!

02:19.173 --> 02:20.908
Well, I was wrong.

02:20.974 --> 02:24.212
It's a hell of a thing
to be wrong about.

02:24.278 --> 02:26.113
You're not taking this too well.

02:26.180 --> 02:28.549
I'm sorry!
So am I!

02:28.616 --> 02:31.919
Hey, I'm the one that's
knocked up, remember?

02:33.287 --> 02:34.588
Damn!

02:37.057 --> 02:38.826
How do you feel?

02:38.892 --> 02:40.861
Oh, great, great,

02:40.928 --> 02:42.863
especially in the morning.

02:46.133 --> 02:48.269
Does anybody else know about this?

02:49.337 --> 02:51.472
Just you and my gynecologist.

02:54.342 --> 02:56.644
What are you going to tell your folks?

03:00.581 --> 03:02.850
What are you going to tell your folks?

03:04.084 --> 03:06.687
Oh, shit! I had these lines down cold.

03:06.754 --> 03:09.357
Oh, Denise.
Steve, I really did.

03:09.423 --> 03:11.359
I can't work with you anymore.

03:11.425 --> 03:13.361
I got to go meet my agent.

03:13.427 --> 03:14.528
Just one more time.

03:14.595 --> 03:16.530
Another day.
When? You name it.

03:16.597 --> 03:19.600
Monday before class. Don't want
to make a fool out of myself.

03:19.667 --> 03:22.670
Alright.
I'll see you then.

03:22.736 --> 03:25.773
I'll see you Monday!
And learn your lines!

03:26.607 --> 03:28.108
[Man]
Corned beef on rye,

03:28.175 --> 03:30.177
extra-lean, extra-thin bread.

03:30.244 --> 03:33.981
I'm a storm, a flame too
strong to war with mortals.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.783
Bring me giants!

03:35.849 --> 03:38.586
Bring him a corned
beef sandwich.

03:38.652 --> 03:41.555
Marty, there's an off-Broadway
production of Cyrano.

03:41.622 --> 03:43.357
Can you get me an audition?

03:43.424 --> 03:45.626
Talk to me about the beer commercial.

03:45.693 --> 03:47.828
I read for them this morning.

03:47.895 --> 03:48.629
And?

03:48.696 --> 03:50.664
And they like my sincerity.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.199
They like your acting?

03:52.266 --> 03:54.201
Oh, Marty, how much can you do

03:54.268 --> 03:55.636
with "that's what I call beer"?

03:55.703 --> 03:57.638
Marty, get me a play, any play.

03:57.705 --> 04:00.541
You had one last summer...

04:00.608 --> 04:02.776
Shakespeare in the park.

04:02.843 --> 04:05.846
I carried a spear.
Jesus, Marty.
That's a joke.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.881
When an actor says
he carried a spear,

04:07.948 --> 04:09.950
he doesn't mean
he carried a spear.

04:10.017 --> 04:12.386
I carried a spear.

04:12.453 --> 04:13.654
[Man]
Steve!

04:14.755 --> 04:16.690
Oh, most worthy person,

04:16.757 --> 04:19.527
prince of actors, friend
of friends, thank you.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.529
Who's the Arab?

04:21.595 --> 04:23.030
Jerry Feldman, Marty Fields.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.032
Hi. Nice
to know you.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.233
I got it.

04:26.300 --> 04:27.868
The Schlitz commercial...
I got it!

04:27.935 --> 04:30.471
Hey, that's great!
No. You're what's great.

04:30.538 --> 04:32.940
I wouldn't have known
about it. You told me.

04:33.006 --> 04:34.575
I'm happy for you.

04:34.642 --> 04:37.611
I'll remember you in my will.

04:37.678 --> 04:39.647
I'll let you guys talk.
I'll call later.

04:39.713 --> 04:42.883
Alright, man. Hey, Jerry.
Congratulations.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.051
Bye.

04:46.487 --> 04:48.656
You told him about
the beer commercial?

04:48.722 --> 04:52.560
Yeah. He's in my acting class.
He's a good guy.

04:52.626 --> 04:55.663
You told him, and he got it.

04:55.729 --> 04:56.897
Schmuck!

04:56.964 --> 04:58.899
He'll do the same
for me sometime.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.734
And you believe that?
Double schmuck!

05:00.801 --> 05:03.404
Oh, come on, Marty.
You didn't lose the commercial.

05:03.471 --> 05:05.238
Did I get 10% from that Arab?

05:05.305 --> 05:06.507
Just get me a play.

05:06.574 --> 05:07.975
I'll get you a head examiner.

05:08.041 --> 05:11.479
Did you put these
on separate checks?

05:11.545 --> 05:13.981
No. I put them on rye,
like you said.

05:14.047 --> 05:17.084
A schmuck and a smart ass. I'm
surrounded!

05:17.150 --> 05:21.822
[Announcer]
This looks like a job
for Captain Avenger!

05:23.591 --> 05:25.192
Captain Avenger!

05:25.258 --> 05:26.594
Mind if I drop in?

05:26.660 --> 05:28.328
[Man]
Get him!

05:40.040 --> 05:42.543
We're saved!

05:42.610 --> 05:45.513
Thank god you got here
just in time.

05:45.579 --> 05:49.249
[Announcer]
Captain Avenger, the superhero
who thrilled a generation,

05:49.316 --> 05:52.019
returns to rock
the motion picture screen

05:52.085 --> 05:53.286
with new excitement.

05:53.353 --> 05:54.855
Sworn to uphold justice,

05:54.922 --> 05:56.857
protect the weak,
and punish wrongdoers,

05:56.924 --> 05:58.926
Captain Avenger fights
a never-ending battle

05:58.992 --> 06:00.994
against the forces of evil.

06:01.061 --> 06:04.331
This is his story,
his greatest adventure.

06:04.398 --> 06:08.301
[Captain Avenger]
Who says nice guys finish last?

06:08.368 --> 06:10.538
[Announcer]
This weekend, Captain Avenger
appears in person

06:10.604 --> 06:12.473
at selected theaters.

06:12.540 --> 06:14.141
[Tires squeal]

06:14.207 --> 06:16.944
And now back to Clark Gable
and Joan Crawford

06:17.010 --> 06:18.979
in strange cargo.

06:23.350 --> 06:26.319
[Clark Gable]
Is it because I haven't
seen any women lately?

06:26.386 --> 06:27.721
Now get smart.

06:27.788 --> 06:29.557
[Joan Crawford]
Why don't you get smart?

06:29.623 --> 06:31.659
You know what they'll do to you.

06:31.725 --> 06:34.928
[Gable]
I'll take all they've got for a little of this.

06:53.514 --> 06:55.716
Sorry.
That's ok.

06:55.783 --> 06:57.350
So, you're J. Marsh.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.352
I'm S. Nichols.
We're neighbors.

06:59.419 --> 07:00.688
Hello.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.990
Here. You want me
to hold that for you?

07:03.056 --> 07:05.192
Thank you.
Oh, you're welcome.

07:08.028 --> 07:10.764
I've seen you come
and go a few times.

07:10.831 --> 07:12.833
I live in the front
apartment up there.

07:12.900 --> 07:15.235
And you watch people
come and go.

07:15.302 --> 07:19.239
Well, I'm an actor,
so I watch people.

07:19.306 --> 07:21.074
Haven't you got that backwards?

07:21.141 --> 07:25.312
No. I learn things about
how people are, you know.

07:25.378 --> 07:26.814
How are they?

07:26.880 --> 07:29.182
Well, you look sort of lonely.

07:29.249 --> 07:30.984
I'm not.

07:31.051 --> 07:33.987
No. That's ok.
We're going in the same direction.

07:34.054 --> 07:36.423
So, did you move here
from out of town?

07:36.490 --> 07:37.825
No.

07:37.891 --> 07:39.660
Somewhere in the city,
like Queens or...

07:39.727 --> 07:43.564
East 66th street.
East 66th street?

07:43.631 --> 07:46.066
Why would anyone move
here from there, right?

07:46.133 --> 07:49.002
No. Hey, I wasn't
thinking that.

07:49.069 --> 07:51.204
You're a lousy liar
for an actor.

07:51.271 --> 07:52.506
[Blender whirring]

07:52.573 --> 07:54.608
That's my tiger shake.
My schefflera!

07:55.909 --> 07:59.179
[Sarcastically]
Oh, good, Steve.
I always do that.

07:59.246 --> 08:01.048
I forget about it.

08:02.249 --> 08:04.718
Uh... this is home.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.522
Looks more like a gymnasium.

08:08.589 --> 08:11.324
Yeah, well, I have to
stay in shape, you know.

08:11.391 --> 08:14.528
I take a lot of lessons...
Voice, movement, fencing.

08:14.595 --> 08:15.829
Collecting.

08:15.896 --> 08:19.066
Yeah. I can't
throw anything away.

08:19.132 --> 08:20.968
You ever act?

08:21.034 --> 08:22.235
Well, sure.

08:22.302 --> 08:23.937
Professionally?

08:25.072 --> 08:26.273
Sometimes.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.275
What do you do other times?

08:28.341 --> 08:32.679
Uh, whatever. Right now
I'm driving relief cab.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.784
Well, may I have my plant now?

08:36.850 --> 08:38.785
I will deliver it to your door.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.788
I think you better
have your drink.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.990
No.
It has to settle.

08:44.558 --> 08:46.927
So, what do you do?

08:46.994 --> 08:47.861
About what?

08:47.928 --> 08:50.530
Well, I act.
What do you do?

08:50.598 --> 08:52.065
I make commercials.

08:52.132 --> 08:54.735
Really? So do I.
I got one running right now.

08:54.802 --> 08:56.436
Other side of the camera.

08:56.503 --> 08:59.506
Oh.
Oh, that's great.

08:59.573 --> 09:00.808
Listen, um...

09:00.874 --> 09:04.544
I guess you already
have a date for tonight.

09:04.612 --> 09:07.014
No. I'm working.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.249
Perfect. I am, too,
till about 10:00.

09:09.316 --> 09:11.251
Maybe we could get together...

09:11.318 --> 09:12.786
We start at 11:00.

09:12.853 --> 09:15.488
It's the only time
we can get into sardi's.

09:15.555 --> 09:17.157
That's where you're working?

09:17.224 --> 09:19.860
Sparkey goes to opening night.

09:19.927 --> 09:23.063
Sparkey the dog?
You do those commercials?

09:23.130 --> 09:24.497
God help me.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.299
Oh, that's funny.

09:27.735 --> 09:30.638
Uh... some other time
when you're not working?

09:31.905 --> 09:33.273
I don't think so.

09:33.340 --> 09:34.507
Why not?

09:34.574 --> 09:36.710
You live in a lousy
neighborhood.

09:39.112 --> 09:40.080
Huh.

09:45.753 --> 09:49.790
[Steve]
There you go, ok?
What's your name, Tiger?

09:49.857 --> 09:51.792
[Boy]
Does it really hurt you

09:51.859 --> 09:53.794
when crooks sock you in the face?

09:53.861 --> 09:56.396
[Steve]
It sure does, little fella.

09:56.463 --> 09:58.398
There you go.

09:58.465 --> 09:59.933
Hi.

10:00.668 --> 10:01.601
Hey, Captain Avenger.

10:01.669 --> 10:02.602
Yes, sir.

10:02.670 --> 10:03.971
Let's see you fly.

10:04.037 --> 10:05.673
Sorry. I don't fly.

10:05.739 --> 10:07.174
Don't let him shit you, man.

10:07.240 --> 10:08.909
Anybody dresses
like that, flies.

10:08.976 --> 10:10.744
You mean, he's a fruit?

10:10.811 --> 10:15.783
You saw the picture.
He don't fool around with girls.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.785
Hey, uh, Captain Avenger...

10:17.851 --> 10:19.987
Can I feel your muscle?

10:20.053 --> 10:21.254
Ha ha ha!

10:21.321 --> 10:23.256
I'll let you feel mine.
You faggot!

10:23.323 --> 10:26.226
Alright, you wise guys,
get out of here.

10:26.293 --> 10:29.296
You want to feel my muscle?
I want to kick your butt!

10:29.362 --> 10:32.900
Eddie, come on.
The others can hear, ok?

10:32.966 --> 10:34.167
I don't believe you.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.403
How can you keep dishing out this stuff?

10:36.469 --> 10:38.638
I'm having fun.
Don't you think this is great?

10:38.706 --> 10:42.943
Great? It's terrible.
We were expecting 400, and we got 40.

10:43.010 --> 10:46.079
[P.A. playing Captain Avenger theme music]

10:48.481 --> 10:50.617

[Girl]
So long, wimp.

11:04.131 --> 11:06.700
How's it going?
Don't ask.

11:06.767 --> 11:09.069
Two years at actor's studio for this?

11:10.771 --> 11:13.640
Well, it's just
like any other part.

11:13.707 --> 11:15.308
You got to really get into it.

11:15.375 --> 11:18.812
When I was at that theater,
I was Captain Avenger.

11:18.879 --> 11:21.882
Listen.
I gave it a shot I was doing ok.

11:21.949 --> 11:24.785
Until some kid got
me with a pellet gun

11:24.852 --> 11:26.920
right in the ass.

11:26.987 --> 11:29.890
Wanted to find out
if I was really tough.

11:29.957 --> 11:31.691
What did you do?
I screamed.

11:31.759 --> 11:34.895
I'm not tough...
Not in the ass.

12:05.258 --> 12:07.427
Excuse me, can I get in there?
We're closed.

12:07.494 --> 12:10.297
Can you stay open long
enough for me to get milk?

12:10.363 --> 12:16.036
We have to go home.
Just for a second?

12:16.103 --> 12:16.837
Ok.

12:16.904 --> 12:19.139
Oh, thank you, sir.

12:19.206 --> 12:21.341

Here. Check me out.
I'm no accountant.

12:32.820 --> 12:34.955
Who can read your handwriting?

12:35.022 --> 12:37.490
Hire yourself a secretary.

12:37.557 --> 12:40.093
What I should do is hire
myself another wife.

12:40.160 --> 12:43.296
Oh, that's good.

12:43.363 --> 12:45.498
No. I'm sorry, dear.
We're closed.

No. Just a bag.

13:12.059 --> 13:13.226
I want your money!

13:13.293 --> 13:14.461
Here, here, here!

13:14.527 --> 13:16.629
Not this.
I want the money!

13:16.696 --> 13:17.664
Where is it?

13:17.730 --> 13:18.866
We haven't got it.

13:18.932 --> 13:20.901
It's in the bank.
We deposited.

13:20.968 --> 13:22.602
Where is the money?

13:22.669 --> 13:25.505
Give him...
Give him money!

13:25.572 --> 13:28.475
I'll cut you if I have to.

13:28.541 --> 13:30.243
I'll cut you in half!

13:30.310 --> 13:31.811
Hey!

13:31.879 --> 13:32.812
Captain Avenger!

13:32.880 --> 13:34.147
Let's get him.

13:34.214 --> 13:36.349
You got the knife.
You get him.

13:36.416 --> 13:37.851
Oh, come on!

13:39.953 --> 13:41.288
Mind if I drop in?

13:41.354 --> 13:43.490
I'm going to cut you, man.

13:59.072 --> 14:00.340
How 'bout that?

14:00.407 --> 14:03.243
I would never believe it
if I didn't see it.

14:03.310 --> 14:05.312
I can't wait to tell my Sheldon.

14:05.378 --> 14:07.647
He always used to read
your comic books.

14:07.714 --> 14:09.449
Yours and Batman!

14:09.516 --> 14:11.952
No. He was always
Sheldon's favorite!

14:12.019 --> 14:13.954
Well, I better get going.

14:14.021 --> 14:15.956
Can we get you something?

14:16.023 --> 14:17.757
Uh...
Oh, my milk!

14:17.824 --> 14:21.461
Almost forgot.
That's what I came in here for.

14:21.528 --> 14:24.664
[Woman]
Oh, I've got some very nice fruit,

14:24.731 --> 14:26.666
some peaches and plums.

14:26.733 --> 14:28.135
How about some nectarines?

14:28.201 --> 14:29.636
No, no.
Just the milk.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.838
That's fine.
Thank you.

14:31.905 --> 14:33.140
Thank you!

14:33.206 --> 14:34.774
How much do I owe you?

14:34.841 --> 14:37.410
Oh, please!
It's on the house.

14:37.477 --> 14:39.947
We couldn't take
a penny from you, darling.

14:40.013 --> 14:41.949
Well, thank you very much.

14:42.015 --> 14:43.183
Thank you!

14:43.250 --> 14:44.317
Bye-bye.

14:44.384 --> 14:45.919
[Woman]
Bye-bye, dear.

14:45.986 --> 14:49.089
Oh, he's such a nice boy.

14:49.156 --> 14:51.091
This is a miracle.

15:02.135 --> 15:04.437
You'll never believe
what just happened to me.

15:04.504 --> 15:06.940
You know that little grocery
store on Bleecker street?

15:07.007 --> 15:09.542
[Man]
Hold on a second, will you?

15:09.609 --> 15:10.810
[People laughing]

15:10.877 --> 15:12.812
No. Hey, Jerry?
What? What?

15:12.879 --> 15:14.814
I'll tell you about it later.

15:14.881 --> 15:16.816
Just tell me when you get here.

15:16.883 --> 15:18.251
Yeah. If I come.

15:18.318 --> 15:21.688
It's crazy!
Ha ha ha!

15:21.754 --> 15:23.690
I'll talk to you later.

15:40.473 --> 15:42.976
Sorry, guys.
I'm a little late.

15:43.043 --> 15:45.178
Soup's on.

15:45.245 --> 15:47.180
[Recording]
This is Marty Fields.

15:47.247 --> 15:49.182
I'm not in right now.

15:49.249 --> 15:51.218
Want to know if you got a job?

15:51.284 --> 15:52.685
The answer's no.

15:52.752 --> 15:55.155
When it's yes, I'll call you.

15:55.222 --> 15:58.758
Any other business,
leave your name and number.

15:58.825 --> 16:00.260
[Beep]

16:00.327 --> 16:02.262
Yeah. This is Robert Redford.

16:02.329 --> 16:04.264
I'm seeking new representation.

16:04.331 --> 16:06.466
Sorry you were out.

16:22.615 --> 16:24.551
[Applause]

16:33.360 --> 16:35.295
[Man]
Ladies and gentlemen,

16:35.362 --> 16:38.898
may I propose a toast
to our beautiful leading lady?

16:38.965 --> 16:40.800
Bravo!

16:40.867 --> 16:42.869
Bravo! Bravo!

16:42.935 --> 16:45.072
May I have your autograph?

16:48.508 --> 16:49.476
Thank you.

16:52.279 --> 16:54.381
Cue the waiter...

16:54.447 --> 16:56.883
And we start to zoom in.

16:56.949 --> 16:58.885
We zoom in even tighter.

16:58.951 --> 17:00.887
Sparkey looks at it,

17:00.953 --> 17:02.522
smells it. Mmm!

17:02.589 --> 17:03.690
Smells terrible.

17:03.756 --> 17:06.358
He looks around
and says, "where's Soupo?

17:06.425 --> 17:07.426
Where's my dog food?"

17:07.493 --> 17:10.196
Look at that eclair!
Cut!

17:10.262 --> 17:11.931
Joe? Ms. Marsh?

17:11.998 --> 17:12.964
[J. Marsh]
Here!

17:13.031 --> 17:14.800
Where is she?

17:14.867 --> 17:16.603
Come over here
where the work is.

17:16.669 --> 17:19.071
Look. I'd pick Soupo
dog food over that.

17:19.138 --> 17:21.074
If you take so long
between takes,

17:21.141 --> 17:22.309
it's going to melt.

17:22.375 --> 17:25.778
It has to be a beautiful eclair, ok?

17:25.845 --> 17:27.980
I've got an entire
refrigerator full.

17:28.047 --> 17:31.184
Would you bring
another pastry, Jeff?

17:31.251 --> 17:32.519
Tell everybody to relax.

17:32.585 --> 17:34.154
Background people, you relax,

17:34.221 --> 17:36.623
but, please, do not wander off.

17:36.689 --> 17:38.891
Now let me hear that playback.

17:38.958 --> 17:42.129
[Music playing]

17:42.195 --> 17:44.631
Excuse me. Hi. Hello.
May I have this dance?

17:44.697 --> 17:47.300
What are you doing here?
Are you crazy?

17:47.367 --> 17:50.002
No. I'm on a high.
Well, come down.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.672
Don't be sore.
I am working.

17:52.739 --> 17:55.175
You're on a break!

17:55.242 --> 17:56.809
Good-bye.
Hello.

17:56.876 --> 17:58.311
It's a prop!

17:58.378 --> 18:00.313
Ok. I'll leave.
You know why?

18:00.380 --> 18:03.283
I'll leave because
I'm a very nice person.

18:03.350 --> 18:05.318
I'm one of the nicest
people you know.

18:05.385 --> 18:07.920
I don't know you.
I'm working on it.

18:07.987 --> 18:11.324
[Man]
Ok. Let's take it from the beginning.

18:11.391 --> 18:13.126
Alright, people.
It's picture time.

18:13.193 --> 18:17.330
If you're not in this shot,
will you please clear out?

18:17.397 --> 18:18.998
Thank you very much.

18:19.065 --> 18:22.001
People, we're laughing
our way into overtime.

18:22.068 --> 18:23.503
Where's the waiter?

18:23.570 --> 18:26.906
Oh, alright. We ready?
Doggy ready? Sound ready?

18:26.973 --> 18:28.241
[Man]
Ready!

18:28.308 --> 18:32.111
Ok, Milo.
Let's go. Roll 'em!

18:32.179 --> 18:35.114
Fade!
And action!

18:35.182 --> 18:37.850
[Music playing]

18:40.653 --> 18:43.156
[Applause]

18:47.760 --> 18:52.699
[Man]
That didn't take too long.

18:54.534 --> 18:57.304
[Man] I'm going to leave the
wardrobes here for now, alright?

18:57.370 --> 18:58.371
[J. Marsh]
Fine.

18:58.438 --> 19:00.072
What about the props?

19:00.139 --> 19:02.074
Don't worry about it, Sean.

19:02.141 --> 19:05.845
Just organize it
as best you can.

19:05.912 --> 19:07.247
Ok. Alright.

19:07.314 --> 19:10.183
How about some coffee?
I don't believe it!

19:10.250 --> 19:11.818
I'll even spring for a Danish.

19:11.884 --> 19:13.753
What are you doing here?

19:15.154 --> 19:17.557
I just felt like being with somebody.

19:17.624 --> 19:20.293
Don't you have any friends?

19:20.360 --> 19:22.061
Not a lot.
Do you?

19:22.128 --> 19:24.197
Hundreds...

19:24.264 --> 19:26.132
Give or take a few.

19:26.199 --> 19:28.735
We'll have some coffee together.
We'll talk.

19:28.801 --> 19:31.238
Wait till you hear what
happened to me tonight.

19:31.304 --> 19:32.939
I can't.

19:33.005 --> 19:37.210
You can't. Well, we can
share a taxi home together.

19:37.277 --> 19:39.178
I got a ride.

19:40.480 --> 19:44.217
Is it something special,
or is it just a ride?

19:45.452 --> 19:50.056
Look... I've got nothing
against you personally.

19:50.122 --> 19:51.090
Thank you.

19:51.157 --> 19:53.092
You're a guy in condition,

19:53.159 --> 19:55.094
and I'm a girl across the hall.

19:55.161 --> 19:56.863
Why shouldn't you try?

19:56.929 --> 19:58.431
But as it happens...

19:58.498 --> 20:00.967
Come on. Let's get out
of here. I'm tired.

20:06.506 --> 20:07.674
[Car doors close]

20:07.740 --> 20:08.908
[Engine starts]

20:16.015 --> 20:17.917
[Laughs]

20:24.190 --> 20:25.358
Hey.

20:25.425 --> 20:27.860
Come on.
I'll buy you some coffee.

20:27.927 --> 20:28.895
Alright.

20:31.130 --> 20:32.732
You will never believe

20:32.799 --> 20:35.067
what happened to me tonight.

20:35.134 --> 20:38.605
You know a little grocery
store on Bleecker street?

20:38.671 --> 20:43.009
Well, I was in this costume
to promote this film.

20:43.075 --> 20:46.346
It's called Captain Avenger.
I had a cape...

20:46.413 --> 20:47.880
Mr. and Mrs. Rothberg,

20:47.947 --> 20:49.782
hasthis neighborhood
really changed

20:49.849 --> 20:51.684
in the years you've been here?

20:51.751 --> 20:55.021
Oh, yes.
As a matter of fact, we were talking...

20:55.087 --> 20:57.924
Maybe we should sell the
store and move away.

20:57.990 --> 20:59.492
After 33 years.

20:59.559 --> 21:01.661
But after last night...

21:01.728 --> 21:03.663
That sort of gives you hope.

21:03.730 --> 21:05.665
[Reporter]
Have youany idea,

21:05.732 --> 21:07.667
who that man was last night?

21:07.734 --> 21:09.836
Certainly.
It was Captain Avenger.

21:09.902 --> 21:14.341
Yeah. Believe me.
You can't miss it.

21:14.407 --> 21:16.409
But, Mr. and Mrs. Rothberg,

21:16.476 --> 21:19.579
Captain Avenger is a character
in the comic books.

21:19.646 --> 21:21.581
I don't care
where he comes from.

21:21.648 --> 21:24.116
A man comes in to the store,

21:24.183 --> 21:27.320
takes care of a couple of punks

21:27.387 --> 21:29.155
that tried to cut my throat.

21:29.221 --> 21:32.825
What should I do...
Ask him for a driver's license?

21:35.795 --> 21:36.863
Hey, J.?

21:36.929 --> 21:39.866
J., turn on your television set.
Hurry!

21:39.932 --> 21:42.835
Mrs. Havacheck...
Huh! I got excited.

21:42.902 --> 21:45.071
Please! I'm not interested
in your personal life.

21:45.137 --> 21:46.539
I'm on TV right now.

21:46.606 --> 21:48.074
Without your trousers?

21:48.140 --> 21:50.142
They're talking about me.
I wouldn't doubt it.

21:50.209 --> 21:53.613
Today is the 15th. That makes
your rent two weeks overdue.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.515
Oh, yeah.
The rent. Right.

21:55.582 --> 21:57.350
You know how it is with actors.

21:57.417 --> 21:59.352
I studied with Ouspenskaya.

21:59.419 --> 22:01.354
I appeared with Sir Galleon.

22:01.421 --> 22:03.356
I toured with Barrymore.

22:03.423 --> 22:05.157
You told me.
We played the classics!

22:05.224 --> 22:08.461
It's a long time between classics.
I did this commercial.

22:08.528 --> 22:11.564
Commercials do not
an actor make!

22:11.631 --> 22:13.566
It's the best I can do.

22:13.633 --> 22:16.403
Pay your rent on the first of
each month.

22:16.469 --> 22:19.806
And don't come out
without trousers!

22:19.872 --> 22:22.609
At least you can walk
on the street at night!

22:22.675 --> 22:25.612
Thank you very much,
Mr. and Mrs. Rothberg.

22:25.678 --> 22:27.514
Calls have been
coming into the switchboard

22:27.580 --> 22:31.551
expressing gratitude, but to whom?
Who is Captain Avenger?

22:31.618 --> 22:33.285
It's me...
Steve Nichols!

22:33.352 --> 22:36.689
Surprisingly, there is very
little curiosity about that.

22:36.756 --> 22:38.891
In fact, some people
have stated flatly

22:38.958 --> 22:40.927
they don't want to know
his true identity.

22:40.993 --> 22:44.497
You can tell a child that
Santa claus is on payroll.

22:44.564 --> 22:48.100
He may believe you, but he
really won't thank you for it.

22:48.167 --> 22:51.671
So perhaps the question isn't
"who are you, Captain Avenger?"

22:51.738 --> 22:53.873
But "what next, Captain Avenger?"

22:53.940 --> 22:56.075
What do you mean, what next?

23:05.351 --> 23:08.621
Eight weeks away
from election day,

23:08.688 --> 23:10.222
and look at us.

23:10.289 --> 23:12.792
A lot can happen in eight weeks.

23:12.859 --> 23:14.160
It better.

23:14.226 --> 23:15.728
He hasn't been a bad mayor.

23:15.795 --> 23:18.064
There's a great campaign slogan...

23:18.130 --> 23:20.266
"He hasn't been a bad mayor."

23:20.332 --> 23:23.536
We focused on a solid, responsible
job for the past four years.

23:23.603 --> 23:25.337
What's wrong with that?

23:25.404 --> 23:28.207
And they focused on subway crime,
blackouts, garbage strikes,

23:28.274 --> 23:30.076
and they laid it all on him!

23:30.142 --> 23:33.680
That's New York.
The incumbent is always under attack.

23:33.746 --> 23:35.782
Tell me something
I don't know, will you?

23:35.848 --> 23:37.950
The bottom line is
they're killing us!

23:38.017 --> 23:39.952
We're trailing
in all the polls...

23:40.019 --> 23:43.656
The New York Times poll,
Lou Harris poll, 6:00 news.

23:43.723 --> 23:46.325
Fine. We'll shift emphasis
away from his record

23:46.392 --> 23:48.327
to his personality.

23:48.394 --> 23:51.030
Except you and I both know...

23:51.097 --> 23:52.932
He hasn't got one.

23:52.999 --> 23:55.935
Your name's on the door out there.

23:56.002 --> 23:58.838
You are the high-priced PR genius.

23:59.539 --> 24:01.173
Work it out.

24:02.108 --> 24:03.843
Calvin, take it easy.

24:03.910 --> 24:05.311
We're coasting, Walter.

24:05.377 --> 24:07.113
We need some fresh ideas.

24:07.179 --> 24:10.182
I don't know what they are,
but I know we need them.

24:10.249 --> 24:13.653
I'm expecting to hear something
from you by the end of the week.

24:13.720 --> 24:15.655
You're really pushing me, Calvin.

24:15.722 --> 24:17.857
You're right.
I am.

24:19.058 --> 24:21.193
[Eddie]
Hey, I've got great news.

24:21.260 --> 24:23.395
Can we talk?
Yeah, yeah.

24:23.462 --> 24:25.865
Linda, keep holding the calls.

24:27.333 --> 24:29.736
[Eddie]
Grosses are in on the Captain Avenger flick.

24:29.802 --> 24:31.738
Lines around the block.
Lines, Walter!

24:31.804 --> 24:33.740
Lines to see that Turkey!

24:33.806 --> 24:36.242
People are going nuts
on account of last night.

24:36.308 --> 24:39.612
They're calling in...
Radio stations, television stations,

24:39.679 --> 24:41.914
even city hall...
To say they're happy.

24:41.981 --> 24:43.916
They're going to see the movie.

24:43.983 --> 24:45.952
When that kook walked
into that grocery store,

24:46.018 --> 24:48.621
it was the best thing
that ever happened to us.

24:48.688 --> 24:49.789
We got a hit!

24:49.856 --> 24:51.791
Two reporters called me here.

24:51.858 --> 24:53.793
I told Linda to stall them

24:53.860 --> 24:56.128
until we could figure
out what to say.

24:56.195 --> 24:58.130
What do you think?

25:02.268 --> 25:03.703
What do I think?

25:05.271 --> 25:07.306
You know what I think?

25:07.373 --> 25:12.044
I think Captain Avenger
just saved the mayor's ass.

25:12.111 --> 25:15.181
You guys hired those yo-yos
to cover the theaters, right?

25:15.247 --> 25:17.283
How many were there?
62.

25:17.349 --> 25:18.517
They keep the outfits?

25:18.585 --> 25:20.720
Yeah.
For the matinee this afternoon.

25:23.055 --> 25:27.359
Ok. You tell them to...
Hang on to those suits.

25:27.426 --> 25:30.029
Tell them they're going
to wear them again,

25:30.096 --> 25:34.200
and maybe one of our
62 Captain Avengers

25:34.266 --> 25:36.569
will make another
special appearance.

25:36.636 --> 25:38.605
How do we know it's one of ours?

25:38.671 --> 25:40.607
Some freak could
have made a costume.

25:40.673 --> 25:42.875
No, no, no.
I know in my heart.

25:42.942 --> 25:44.877
I know it's one of ours.

25:44.944 --> 25:47.079
You guys are going to find him.

25:47.146 --> 25:48.314
Bring him in?

25:48.380 --> 25:50.950
No. If he'd wanted us
to know who he was,

25:51.017 --> 25:52.952
we'd have heard from him by now.

25:53.019 --> 25:54.987
I want you to check
him out, quietly.

25:55.054 --> 25:57.824
Find out which one could
do it and would do it,

25:57.890 --> 26:01.393
and get out word
that one's missing.

26:01.460 --> 26:02.995
A guy?

26:03.062 --> 26:04.163
A costume.

26:05.932 --> 26:07.967
Tell them that it was stolen.

26:08.034 --> 26:10.803
That'll confuse anybody who's
trying to find out who he is.

26:10.870 --> 26:12.605
Still say it could be anybody.

26:12.672 --> 26:15.775
That's why my name is on
the front door, not yours.

26:15.842 --> 26:19.211
Gentlemen, we have
a golden opportunity.

26:19.278 --> 26:22.615
Let us take it firmly...
By the private parts.

26:24.116 --> 26:27.386
[P.A. playing Captain Avenger theme music]

26:27.453 --> 26:29.555
[Cheering and applause]

26:29.622 --> 26:31.758
[Horn honks]

26:35.662 --> 26:39.598
[Cheering]

26:42.301 --> 26:43.369
My god...

26:43.435 --> 26:46.038
The more I see it,
the less I believe it.

26:46.105 --> 26:47.674
[Boy]
Can I have your autograph?

26:47.740 --> 26:48.975
Sure.

26:50.810 --> 26:52.244
Chuck, set up over there.

26:52.311 --> 26:54.781
Tom, go get Captain Avenger.
Let's go.

26:54.847 --> 26:57.717
[Boy]
Captain Avenger, you're the man!

26:57.784 --> 26:59.618
[Cheering]

27:01.287 --> 27:03.589
Gloria Preston wants to
interview you for television.

27:03.656 --> 27:05.391
You mind coming here?

27:05.457 --> 27:08.828
Oh, ok. Sure.

27:10.196 --> 27:11.263
Ok.

27:11.330 --> 27:13.465
We're here at
the Greenwich Theater

27:13.532 --> 27:15.267
in New York's West Village.

27:15.334 --> 27:17.603
A large crowd has gathered to meet

27:17.670 --> 27:19.839
or catch a glimpse at Captain Avenger.

27:19.906 --> 27:21.307
Hi. How are you?

27:21.373 --> 27:22.408
Hi. Fine.

27:22.474 --> 27:24.210
This is my seventh stop.

27:24.276 --> 27:27.413
People in Brooklyn are doing
this and all around queens...

27:27.479 --> 27:30.082
As a matter of fact, all
over greater New York.

27:30.149 --> 27:32.318
What do you think of
all this attention?

27:32.384 --> 27:34.120
I think it's terrific.

27:34.186 --> 27:35.955
It sure sells tickets.

27:36.022 --> 27:38.624
Yeah, but that's not
quite what I meant.

27:38.691 --> 27:40.526
Let me ask you the same question

27:40.592 --> 27:42.762
I've asked half a dozen
other Captain Avengers.

27:42.829 --> 27:45.832
Where were you last night at 10:00?

27:45.898 --> 27:49.435
I was having dinner with a girl.

27:49.501 --> 27:50.803
Ooh!

27:50.870 --> 27:52.805
Would you like to introduce yourself?

27:52.872 --> 27:55.875
Oh, sure. My name is Steve Nichols.

27:55.942 --> 27:57.676
An actor, model, or what?

27:57.744 --> 27:59.078
I'm an actor.

27:59.145 --> 28:02.181
How do you account for this turnout?

28:02.248 --> 28:04.216
Do you think these people may be here

28:04.283 --> 28:06.719
on the chance that you're
the Captain Avenger,

28:06.786 --> 28:08.654
the, uh, grocery store hero?

28:08.721 --> 28:13.092
Unfortunately, I don't think
it has anything to do with me.

28:13.159 --> 28:14.226
What, then?

28:14.293 --> 28:18.030
Well, um, I think it's the idea.

28:18.097 --> 28:19.231
The idea?

28:19.298 --> 28:21.901
Yeah. You know, what Captain
Avenger stands for...

28:21.968 --> 28:24.603
What's right and for justice.

28:24.670 --> 28:26.705
I think these people like that,

28:26.773 --> 28:28.707
you know. Yeah.

28:28.775 --> 28:32.812
See, Captain Avenger looks out
for the little guy, and he wins.

28:32.879 --> 28:35.081
It makes people feel

28:35.147 --> 28:37.750
like they have a chance, you know?

28:37.817 --> 28:41.120
We've just heard from Steve Nichols,

28:41.187 --> 28:43.389
1 of 62 Captain Avengers

28:43.455 --> 28:46.725
making appearances at movie
theaters all around New York

28:46.793 --> 28:49.796
and giving his thoughts on
what this is all about,

28:49.862 --> 28:54.533
an idea come to life, out of
the comics onto the front pages

28:54.600 --> 28:56.435
to make us all feel better.

28:56.502 --> 28:58.104
It sounds good to me.

28:58.170 --> 29:01.841
Hurray for Captain Avenger
and Mickey Mouse for president.

29:01.908 --> 29:05.044
This is Gloria Preston
from Greenwich Village.

29:16.055 --> 29:20.226
Hi. Hi. J. Marsh.
We're neighbors.

29:20.292 --> 29:23.495
I'm sorry. My head
was someplace else. Hi.

29:23.562 --> 29:25.932
Um, about last night.

29:25.998 --> 29:27.934
I'm sorry I barged in on you.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.936
No. I could have been nicer.

29:30.002 --> 29:31.938
No. That was way out of line.

29:32.004 --> 29:33.605
I've been a little uptight lately.

29:33.672 --> 29:35.975
That's ok.
It's my fault.

29:39.345 --> 29:40.813
Well!

29:45.084 --> 29:46.752
I got it.
That's ok.

29:46.819 --> 29:47.987
Ok?

29:54.226 --> 29:55.862
Hi.

29:55.928 --> 29:58.097
I knocked on your door this morning.

29:58.164 --> 29:59.098
Oh?

29:59.165 --> 30:01.567
About 8:30. You're a sound sleeper.

30:01.633 --> 30:04.370
I spent the night out.

30:04.436 --> 30:07.173
That was a special ride, wasn't it?

30:08.440 --> 30:10.042
With an old friend.

30:10.109 --> 30:13.679
Does that old friend
live on east 66th street?

30:13.745 --> 30:16.048
Who are you...
J. Edgar Hoover?

30:16.115 --> 30:19.085
Nope.
I'm Captain Avenger.

30:19.151 --> 30:20.152
Right.

30:20.219 --> 30:22.354
I guess you heard
about last night?

30:22.421 --> 30:25.391
How could I help it?
What do you think?

30:25.457 --> 30:27.593
The world is full of weirdos.

30:30.429 --> 30:32.398
That's it?
He's a weirdo?

30:32.464 --> 30:34.466
Probably stoned out of his mind,

30:34.533 --> 30:38.437
sitting around today trying
to figure out how he did it.

30:38.504 --> 30:41.740
You have a terrific way
of looking at things.

30:41.807 --> 30:44.010
I traded my rose-colored
glasses in

30:44.076 --> 30:46.078
for a crash course in karate

30:46.145 --> 30:50.482
and a fountain pen
that shoots tear gas.

30:50.549 --> 30:52.484
I'll keep my distance.

30:54.486 --> 30:57.256
Why did you knock on my door?

30:57.323 --> 30:59.525
I was going to tell
you a funny story.

30:59.591 --> 31:02.628
I'm not the best
audience at 8:30.

31:02.694 --> 31:04.630
You would have
laughed at this one.

31:04.696 --> 31:06.165
So tell me.

31:07.733 --> 31:09.868
I forgot the punch line.

31:15.975 --> 31:17.676
Ever since we met,

31:17.743 --> 31:20.479
I can't think of anyone but you.

31:20.546 --> 31:26.585
You are my whole life,
my reason for being.

31:26.652 --> 31:29.088
You mustn't say
things like that.

31:30.957 --> 31:33.892
I have to say what's true.

31:33.960 --> 31:35.827
I don't understand.

31:35.894 --> 31:37.896
I don't know what you want.

31:37.964 --> 31:41.033
I want to surround you,

31:41.100 --> 31:43.469
to possess you,

31:43.535 --> 31:46.538
to absorb you.

31:46.605 --> 31:47.573
No.

31:49.008 --> 31:51.077
Why are you turning away...

31:51.143 --> 31:53.512
I'm sorry.
I can't do this.

31:53.579 --> 31:56.182
I mean, he and I...
Look at us.

31:56.248 --> 31:59.918
That's alright, Steve.
Thank you very much.

31:59.986 --> 32:02.254
No, I'm sorry.
I'll try it again.

32:02.321 --> 32:03.722
It won't be necessary.

32:03.789 --> 32:07.126
I'm used to it now.
If I could try again...

32:07.193 --> 32:09.928
I have a number of other
people waiting to read.

32:09.996 --> 32:12.298
Ok? Thank you.

32:16.402 --> 32:18.437
I guess I blew it, huh?

32:18.504 --> 32:21.640
No. No, that was lovely, really.

32:21.707 --> 32:23.742
Nice.

32:23.809 --> 32:25.444
Thank you.

32:31.984 --> 32:33.619
Who's next?

32:40.159 --> 32:41.460
[Horn honks]

32:45.064 --> 32:46.498
[Honk honk]

32:54.040 --> 32:55.974
[Woman]
Mr. Nichols!

32:56.042 --> 32:57.776
Mrs. Havacheck.
I know.

32:57.843 --> 33:01.680
About the rent...
I'm sure there's a residual check

33:01.747 --> 33:03.682
in my mailbox right now.

33:03.749 --> 33:04.983
It's so overdue.

33:05.051 --> 33:06.485
These things happen.

33:06.552 --> 33:08.787
The agents have to take
out their commission,

33:08.854 --> 33:10.789
and the computers foul up,

33:10.856 --> 33:13.692
but I'm sure it's here.

33:13.759 --> 33:15.694
It's not here.

33:15.761 --> 33:17.396
Can you believe this?

33:17.463 --> 33:19.631
They are running my
commercial all the time.

33:19.698 --> 33:21.067
Maybe you've seen it.

33:21.133 --> 33:22.868
I only watch
public broadcasting.

33:22.934 --> 33:28.174
Oh. Well, I'm going to call my
agent right now and raise hell.

33:28.240 --> 33:32.578
It's not fair to you,
and it's not fair to me.

33:32.644 --> 33:34.280
Hello.

33:34.346 --> 33:36.482
Haven't seen you for a while.

33:41.987 --> 33:43.922
How is the acting business?

33:43.989 --> 33:46.125
I wouldn't know.

33:49.561 --> 33:50.962
You look great.

33:51.029 --> 33:52.498
Thank you.

33:54.800 --> 33:56.102
Well...

33:57.136 --> 33:58.704
See you later.

33:58.770 --> 34:00.072
Ok.

34:02.874 --> 34:06.378
Tonight, Mr. Nichols, or else.

34:06.445 --> 34:08.980
Gimme a break, will you?

34:09.047 --> 34:10.782
Authorities are still wondering

34:10.849 --> 34:15.754
who the man in the
costume really is.

34:15.821 --> 34:19.625
Carol, any reports of a second
appearance by Captain Avenger?

34:19.690 --> 34:22.828
Not yet, rollin, but calls
havecontinued to come in

34:22.893 --> 34:26.297
with people saying they feel
good about what happened.

34:26.364 --> 34:28.967
We still need heroes.

34:29.034 --> 34:31.270
And that's channel 2 news.
Good night, Carol.

34:31.337 --> 34:33.172
Good night, rollin,

34:33.239 --> 34:35.741
and good night, Captain
Avenger, wherever you are.

I've lost them.

of 27th and Lexington...

S. Nichols?
Is that you?

38:46.725 --> 38:50.496
Tsk-tsk.
Drunk as a skunk.

38:50.562 --> 38:52.297
What you got on?

38:52.364 --> 38:53.565
It's a gag, right?

38:53.632 --> 38:55.767
You've been to a costume party.

38:55.834 --> 38:56.835
I wish.

38:56.902 --> 38:58.404
Then what?

39:00.439 --> 39:03.809
Uh, I got a little
carried away this time.

39:03.875 --> 39:06.512
You're not going to tell me...

39:06.578 --> 39:08.079
S. Nichols is...

39:08.146 --> 39:09.481
Captain Avenger.

39:09.548 --> 39:12.050
I don't believe it.
It's true.

39:12.117 --> 39:14.052
What is it?

39:14.119 --> 39:17.989
J., they got me.

39:18.056 --> 39:20.325
You haven't got
a bullet in there?

39:20.392 --> 39:23.361
But you were shot? We better
get you in your apartment.

39:23.429 --> 39:25.397
It's locked.
What?

39:25.464 --> 39:27.232
I didn't pay the rent.

39:27.298 --> 39:30.402
Mrs. Havacheck, you are a wonderful person.

39:30.469 --> 39:32.170
Isn't she?

39:32.237 --> 39:36.408
You can't stay here.
I better get you into my apartment.

39:36.475 --> 39:38.209
Can you stand up?

39:38.276 --> 39:39.678
Yeah, I think so.

39:39.745 --> 39:42.881
Put your arm around me. OK?

39:46.418 --> 39:47.686
Lean on me.

39:47.753 --> 39:50.489
Oh, yeah.
That... that helps.

39:50.556 --> 39:52.624
You don't look that heavy.

39:52.691 --> 39:54.893
I'm sorry you have to deal with this.

39:54.960 --> 39:56.127
You and me both.

39:56.194 --> 39:58.430
It's not too serious.
It stopped bleeding.

39:58.497 --> 40:03.535
Don't talk about bleeding.
I have a problem with that.

40:04.736 --> 40:05.504
Ow!

40:05.571 --> 40:08.574
Sorry!
It's ok.

40:08.640 --> 40:10.241
You have a doctor?

40:10.308 --> 40:11.877
Uh, yes, I do.

40:13.879 --> 40:16.414
Only he's back in
Cawker City, Kansas.

40:16.482 --> 40:18.116
Figures.

40:19.485 --> 40:20.719
This is nice.

40:20.786 --> 40:22.420
I'll call emergency.

40:22.488 --> 40:24.422
No, please.
I'll be alright.

40:24.490 --> 40:26.357
All I need is to rest.

40:26.424 --> 40:29.695
Don't. They have to report
gunshot wounds, and...

40:29.761 --> 40:32.230
I'll be fine.
I just need to rest.

40:32.297 --> 40:34.666
It's ok. Oh, see?

40:34.733 --> 40:37.469
Oh, well, now,
I'm better already.

40:41.873 --> 40:43.875
Ok.

40:43.942 --> 40:46.144
I don't know
which of us is crazier,

40:46.211 --> 40:47.345
but ok.

40:47.412 --> 40:50.516
Of all the beds
in all the apartments

40:50.582 --> 40:52.718
in all of New York City...

40:54.853 --> 40:57.556
Captain Avenger ends up in mine.

41:01.459 --> 41:05.063
Tell him I want what I
want when I want it.

41:05.130 --> 41:08.366
I'll be around no matter
who wins the election.

41:08.433 --> 41:12.938
Just let him know gently
that I'll always be around.

41:16.274 --> 41:17.709
You're late.

41:17.776 --> 41:20.311
I'm sorry, Cal, but
have I got an idea.

41:20.378 --> 41:24.215
I'm sorry, too, because
it's too little, too late.

41:24.282 --> 41:25.717
You're through, Walter.

41:25.784 --> 41:28.386
We fell four points
in the latest poll.

41:28.453 --> 41:30.722
I know. I saw this.

41:30.789 --> 41:33.725
I'm talking to
an aggressive young man

41:33.792 --> 41:35.727
with some bright ideas.

41:35.794 --> 41:38.564
He's hungry, and that
makes people aggressive.

41:38.630 --> 41:40.732
Really?
Can he bring you

41:40.799 --> 41:43.268
the election in
a box, gift-wrapped?

41:43.334 --> 41:45.470
Can he do that, Calvin?

41:45.537 --> 41:48.173
What are you talking about?

41:48.239 --> 41:51.743
Captain Avenger,
that's what I'm talking about.

41:51.810 --> 41:54.379
How do you like
what's happening?

41:54.445 --> 41:57.248
How would you like
him to keep it up?

41:57.315 --> 42:00.819
How would you like it if he stayed
in action uptil election day?

42:00.886 --> 42:02.153
What's the point?

42:02.220 --> 42:03.555
The point is,

42:03.622 --> 42:05.624
when the people feel
good about the city,

42:05.691 --> 42:08.059
they feel good about
the administration, right?

42:08.126 --> 42:10.562
Well, the people feel good
about the city today

42:10.629 --> 42:13.064
because of him.

42:13.131 --> 42:14.866
A comic book hero?

42:14.933 --> 42:17.502
Read the papers, Calvin.
Watch the news.

42:17.569 --> 42:19.705
New York loves Captain Avenger.

42:21.439 --> 42:24.375
Who is he, Walter?

42:24.442 --> 42:26.144
Uh-uh.

42:26.211 --> 42:29.414
You can tell him what to
do and when to do it?

42:29.480 --> 42:31.349
I set up the whole thing.

42:31.416 --> 42:35.253
I made a third-rate movie, the hit
of the year with a simple gimmick...

42:35.320 --> 42:38.056
Captain Avenger comes
to your neighborhood.

42:39.691 --> 42:41.192
Who is he?

42:41.259 --> 42:43.061
Come on, Calvin.

42:47.398 --> 42:53.238
Ok, but there will have
to be a closer connection.

42:53.304 --> 42:54.272
You bet.

42:54.339 --> 42:56.074
Photographs for the media.

42:56.141 --> 42:58.576
Captain Avenger meets the mayor.

42:58.644 --> 43:00.145
Two crusaders working together

43:00.211 --> 43:02.681
toward a better life
for the people.

43:02.748 --> 43:04.382
It is a natural.

43:04.449 --> 43:07.418
You'll have to do bigger
stuff with more witnesses.

43:07.485 --> 43:08.620
Can you arrange that?

43:08.687 --> 43:10.789
It's already in
the planning stage.

43:10.856 --> 43:15.193
Oh, Walter. Walter!
I was writing you off.

43:28.273 --> 43:29.240
S. Nichols?

43:29.307 --> 43:31.342
Oh, yeah. Hi.

43:31.409 --> 43:32.811
What are you doing?

43:32.878 --> 43:34.646
I'm just freshening my breath.

43:34.713 --> 43:36.347
Get back in bed.

43:36.414 --> 43:38.549
Also fighting tooth decay.

43:38.616 --> 43:40.185
A hero's work is never done.

43:40.251 --> 43:42.353
Get back in bed.

43:43.755 --> 43:46.224
I love the way you say that.

43:46.291 --> 43:47.993
Are you hungry?

43:48.059 --> 43:51.029
Oh, no. No, I couldn't
eat right now.

43:51.096 --> 43:53.264
Good. Then we can
get this over with.

43:53.331 --> 43:54.800
Get what over with?

43:54.866 --> 43:57.202
This very nice man
at the pharmacy

43:57.268 --> 44:00.238
told me exactly what to do.

44:00.305 --> 44:02.473
I told him my dog
had an accident.

44:02.540 --> 44:04.175
With a gun?

44:04.242 --> 44:08.847
He didn't know it was loaded.
He's only a dog.

44:11.016 --> 44:13.651
It's only fair to warn you,

44:13.719 --> 44:16.988
I am not experienced
at this and may faint.

44:17.055 --> 44:20.291
I don't expect you
to take care of me.

44:20.358 --> 44:22.293
Who do you suggest?

44:22.360 --> 44:25.163
You're such a good neighbor.

44:25.230 --> 44:27.198
Did you, by any chance,
pick this up

44:27.265 --> 44:31.569
in the vicinity
of park and 52nd?

44:31.636 --> 44:33.972
How did you know that?

44:34.039 --> 44:36.574
The guy that shot you
wants credit,

44:36.641 --> 44:38.576
but since nobody else saw you,

44:38.643 --> 44:41.747
he's having a hard time
proving it.

44:41.813 --> 44:44.816
I picked this up in case
you keep a scrapbook.

44:51.289 --> 44:54.259
Quarter of a million dollars
worth of angel dust?

44:54.325 --> 44:55.961
Hardly a record,

44:56.027 --> 44:58.629
but after all,
it was your first bust.

44:58.696 --> 45:02.734
You really didn't know what you
were getting into last night?

45:02.801 --> 45:05.236
Really didn't.

45:05.303 --> 45:07.806
Who sends you out on
these missions, anyway?

45:07.873 --> 45:09.340
Your agent?

45:09.407 --> 45:12.243
No. He only sends me out
on beer commercials.

45:15.346 --> 45:17.983
Why?
Why do you do it?

45:21.953 --> 45:24.455
Because of what happened...

45:24.522 --> 45:27.392
All those people calling
in and writing letters.

45:27.458 --> 45:30.762
How often do you get a
chance to do something

45:30.829 --> 45:34.132
that's really special, you know?

45:35.300 --> 45:37.468
You really mean that, don't you?

45:37.535 --> 45:39.004
You're for real.

45:40.005 --> 45:42.240
And nobody knows?

45:42.307 --> 45:43.408
Just you.

45:45.176 --> 45:48.713
What do you do...
Keep it up till somebody kills you?

45:48.780 --> 45:53.284
No. If they're going to use real
bullets, I think I'll retire.

45:53.985 --> 45:55.987
[Honks horn]

45:57.789 --> 45:59.925
That's for me.

46:02.127 --> 46:04.262
I'll be right there.

46:11.903 --> 46:14.039
You going out?

46:14.105 --> 46:16.641
Yeah. Got a date.

46:16.707 --> 46:18.176
Oh, good.

46:22.848 --> 46:24.850
[Clears throat]

46:24.916 --> 46:27.152
Listen, I...
I'm in the way.

46:27.218 --> 46:30.155
Why don't I get out of here?

46:30.221 --> 46:32.557
You're in terrific
shape to travel.

46:32.623 --> 46:34.425
Well, I could manage.

46:35.827 --> 46:38.163
Look, uh, it's alright with me

46:38.229 --> 46:41.499
if you want to stay here
until you're feeling better.

46:41.566 --> 46:44.903
You don't take up much room,
and I'm gone a lot.

46:46.671 --> 46:51.009
I don't even know your name,
what the J. stands for.

46:51.709 --> 46:53.011
Jolene.

46:54.445 --> 46:57.148
Listen, J., I'll tell
you what I'll do.

46:57.215 --> 46:59.350
I'll move to the sofa.

46:59.417 --> 47:00.886
I accept.

47:13.831 --> 47:16.101
Sorry.
What kept you?

47:16.167 --> 47:18.236
You wouldn't believe it.

47:18.303 --> 47:19.637
Uh, try me.

47:19.704 --> 47:23.541
When I got home last
night, I found this stray.

47:24.943 --> 47:26.411
You took him in?

47:26.477 --> 47:28.713
He'd been hurt.
I was taking care of him.

47:28.779 --> 47:33.784
Don't get started.
There are strays all over New York.

47:33.851 --> 47:35.987
Not like this one.

48:03.681 --> 48:04.983
Hi.

48:06.251 --> 48:08.253
It's just me...
Captain Avenger.

48:08.319 --> 48:10.455
I thought you'd be asleep.

48:12.123 --> 48:14.125
Well, that was some date.

48:15.326 --> 48:17.295
We lingered over dinner.

48:17.362 --> 48:18.596
Oh.

48:18.663 --> 48:20.932
Just you and, um...

48:20.999 --> 48:22.600
Milo.

48:22.667 --> 48:24.235
Right. Right.

48:26.037 --> 48:28.173
Where did he take you... Elaine's?

48:30.175 --> 48:32.978
A little restaurant in Chinatown.

48:33.044 --> 48:36.614
Ah, so!
Oriental atmosphere.

48:36.681 --> 48:39.584
Curiously seductive.

48:39.650 --> 48:42.220
I like Chinese food.

48:42.287 --> 48:45.423
Mm. Gentleman strive to please.

48:45.490 --> 48:49.494
He want you back
in house on, uh...

48:49.560 --> 48:51.429
East 66th street.

48:51.496 --> 48:55.300
Confucius say,
grandma have long nose.

48:55.366 --> 48:57.702
Well, I care about these things

48:57.768 --> 48:59.837
now that I'm living with you.

48:59.904 --> 49:01.872
You are not living with me.

49:01.939 --> 49:04.075
Well, visiting with you.

49:07.078 --> 49:08.746
How's the arm?

49:08.813 --> 49:11.616
Oh. You did a great job.

49:14.019 --> 49:16.154
Probably saved my life.

49:25.296 --> 49:27.965
Yes, he wants me back.

49:30.435 --> 49:33.338
And what about you?
How do you feel?

49:35.473 --> 49:39.144
Excuse me, but that is
none of your business.

49:39.210 --> 49:41.146
Don't let him rush you.

49:41.212 --> 49:44.049
A guy like that can be very pushy.

49:44.115 --> 49:46.051
How do you know that?

49:46.117 --> 49:49.387
The car. It's a dead giveaway.

49:49.454 --> 49:52.157
[Laughs]

49:52.223 --> 49:54.559
You're crazy.

49:54.625 --> 49:57.295
Of course, that's not
exactly a news flash.

50:02.833 --> 50:07.138
Steve.
My name's Steve.

50:10.975 --> 50:13.778
Good night, Steve.

50:13.844 --> 50:15.513
Good night, J.

50:18.716 --> 50:20.051
Jeff Goldstein.

50:20.118 --> 50:22.353
A Jewish Captain Avenger?

50:22.420 --> 50:25.022
Captain Avenger is a wasp.

50:25.090 --> 50:26.057
Here.

50:26.124 --> 50:27.892
This is Steve Nichols.

50:27.958 --> 50:29.894
I was with him that first day.

50:29.960 --> 50:31.362
And?

50:31.429 --> 50:33.598
He's sort of strange.

50:33.664 --> 50:36.101
I won't go with a pansy.

50:36.167 --> 50:39.370
Oh, not that.
Not one of those.

50:39.437 --> 50:42.507
He takes this Captain
Avenger very seriously.

50:42.573 --> 50:45.042
He really wants
kids to like him.

50:45.110 --> 50:46.911
That kind of strange.

50:46.977 --> 50:50.315
Alright.
Let's see, uh...

50:50.381 --> 50:52.683
Ok.

50:52.750 --> 50:55.086
Tell me about Matt Lewis.
I know him.

50:55.153 --> 50:57.688
Actor, model, into bodybuilding.

50:57.755 --> 50:59.290
That's six of them.

50:59.357 --> 51:03.094
Tony and I think it's got
to be one of these guys.

51:03.161 --> 51:05.596
You want to see them all?

51:05.663 --> 51:09.066
No. Just this one.

51:09.134 --> 51:11.436
Why him?

51:12.137 --> 51:14.071
I don't know.

51:14.139 --> 51:15.773
I...

51:15.840 --> 51:17.408
Just got a feeling.

51:18.543 --> 51:23.181
Hey, J... J.
I'm in big trouble.

51:23.248 --> 51:24.782
Swim for shore.

51:24.849 --> 51:26.984
I have nothing to wear.

51:27.051 --> 51:29.387
Fighting crime is a dirty business.

51:29.454 --> 51:32.257
I'm trapped in here.

51:32.323 --> 51:35.193
Can you wear size 7 in junior dresses?

51:35.260 --> 51:38.129
[Knock on door]

51:38.196 --> 51:40.898
Someone's here.
Yeah, I heard.

51:40.965 --> 51:42.300
Keep the splashing down.

51:42.367 --> 51:43.701
Anything you say.

51:43.768 --> 51:44.735
Shh!

51:48.105 --> 51:49.106
Milo!

51:49.174 --> 51:50.775
[Milo]
Hi.

51:50.841 --> 51:52.977
Get your bikini.
We're going sailing.

51:53.043 --> 51:54.679
What?

51:54.745 --> 51:57.748
Mr. Soupo dog food wants to
take me out on his 40-footer

51:57.815 --> 52:01.786
and said to bring the
playmate of my choice... you.

52:03.087 --> 52:05.890
Well, thanks, but,
uh, I've got plans.

52:07.292 --> 52:08.726
What kind of plans?

52:08.793 --> 52:11.996
Well, personal plans.
Break them.

52:12.062 --> 52:13.564
I can't.

52:13.631 --> 52:16.667
I thought we came to an
agreement last night.

52:16.734 --> 52:19.370
Not that I remember.
Sure, we did.

52:19.437 --> 52:22.807
You came to an agreement,
Milo, with yourself.

52:22.873 --> 52:24.108
Get your stuff together.

52:24.175 --> 52:26.110
We'll talk about all this later.

52:26.177 --> 52:29.847
Milo, you can be very pushy.

52:29.914 --> 52:32.116
Alright. We'll
talk about it now.

52:32.183 --> 52:34.319
No!

52:34.385 --> 52:37.154
I want you to go.

52:37.222 --> 52:40.325
Hey, what's the matter with you?

52:40.391 --> 52:42.227
There's nothing the matter,

52:42.293 --> 52:44.995
except that I am about to get angry.

52:45.062 --> 52:48.132
Why? Because I want to stop you

52:48.199 --> 52:51.969
from making a very large mistake?

52:52.036 --> 52:53.771
I am getting angry.

52:53.838 --> 52:56.774
Hey, we belong together.
We're a team.

52:56.841 --> 53:00.378
Not true. I am part of your team.

53:00.445 --> 53:02.547
Haven't I taken good care of you?

53:02.613 --> 53:06.984
You treat me like a thing.
I am not a thing.

53:07.051 --> 53:10.154
Let me take you
out of this hole.

53:10.221 --> 53:12.089
Now I'm angry.

53:12.156 --> 53:16.261
This hole happens to be my
home, and I want you out.

53:16.327 --> 53:17.462
Take it easy.

53:17.528 --> 53:19.997
Now! I want you to go now.

53:20.064 --> 53:24.235
I'll go when I'm good
and goddamn ready.

53:24.302 --> 53:26.437
I'm counting to 3, Milo.

53:28.606 --> 53:30.741
Who the hell is that?

53:30.808 --> 53:33.043
1...

53:33.110 --> 53:34.779
You better go.

53:34.845 --> 53:36.080
2...

53:36.146 --> 53:38.283
So this is your stray.

53:50.961 --> 53:52.530
3.

53:52.597 --> 53:55.132
Listen, he's not the guy for you.

53:55.199 --> 53:57.468
I knew that the first time I saw him.

53:57.535 --> 54:01.138
You don't know anything.
Look at you.

54:01.205 --> 54:03.140
You're a crazy man

54:03.207 --> 54:05.310
who dresses up in a comic book suit

54:05.376 --> 54:07.312
and goes around doing good deeds

54:07.378 --> 54:09.714
like an overgrown boy scout.

54:09.780 --> 54:11.649
Yeah, but...

54:11.716 --> 54:14.852
I would never treat
you like a thing.

54:21.992 --> 54:27.231
Who are you, and what are
you doing in my apartment?

54:27.298 --> 54:29.434
You want me to leave?
Yes. No!

54:29.500 --> 54:30.868
Ow!
Sorry!

54:30.935 --> 54:33.638
It's ok.

54:41.178 --> 54:43.314
I don't want to get involved.

54:46.517 --> 54:48.018
I just got uninvolved.

54:48.085 --> 54:49.554
I know.

54:52.523 --> 54:55.960
A struggling actor from Cawker City

54:56.026 --> 54:58.963
and a nut, at that.

54:59.029 --> 55:01.065
A nice nut.
Thank you.

55:01.131 --> 55:03.067
But a nut's a nut.

55:26.357 --> 55:27.992
I want you to know,

55:28.058 --> 55:29.860
I'm not always this easy.

55:29.927 --> 55:32.497
I bet you say that to all the girls.

55:33.631 --> 55:35.299
I don't suppose you've seen

55:35.366 --> 55:37.502
a high-heeled shoe anywhere.

55:39.437 --> 55:41.171
Do you have to go?

55:41.238 --> 55:43.474
Job interviews are very
important at this point

55:43.541 --> 55:48.012
since I don't think I'm going to
be doing much more work for Milo.

55:48.078 --> 55:50.548
I'll take care of you.

55:50.615 --> 55:53.117
I don't want to be
taken care of.

55:53.183 --> 55:57.054
Besides, you can't even
take care of yourself.

55:57.121 --> 55:59.056
My luck is changing.

55:59.123 --> 56:00.357
You're sure about that?

56:00.425 --> 56:02.393
Yep. Yours, too.

56:02.460 --> 56:04.094
Maybe you're right.

56:04.161 --> 56:06.096
I just found my shoe.

56:11.569 --> 56:13.370
Come here.

56:13.438 --> 56:15.039
Uh-uh.

56:15.906 --> 56:17.542
I gotta go.

56:20.277 --> 56:22.880
Just one minute.

56:22.947 --> 56:24.882
See you later.

56:31.388 --> 56:33.123
Well, hello.

56:33.190 --> 56:34.358
Hello.

56:34.425 --> 56:36.861
I'm looking for Steve Nichols.

56:36.927 --> 56:38.863
His apartment
is across the hall.

56:38.929 --> 56:40.998
Yeah, but he's not in it.

56:41.065 --> 56:44.234
The landlady thought you
might know where he is.

56:44.301 --> 56:46.437
I wonder where
she gets her ideas.

56:46.504 --> 56:50.941
I'm from, uh, Walter
Reeves' public relations.

56:51.008 --> 56:54.645
It's very important
that I talk to Mr. Nichols.

56:54.712 --> 56:56.413
It's about a job.

56:56.481 --> 56:57.848
Oh!

56:57.915 --> 57:00.417
Could you excuse me
for a minute, please?

57:15.399 --> 57:17.568
I've just located him.

57:17.635 --> 57:20.104
Oh, good, good, good.

57:20.170 --> 57:21.405
Hiya, Steve.

57:21.472 --> 57:23.373
Eddie, it's nice to see you again.

57:23.440 --> 57:26.076
How are you?

57:26.143 --> 57:27.945
Did you hurt yourself?

57:28.012 --> 57:32.116
Well, yeah. I fell.
I was just clumsy.

57:32.182 --> 57:33.751
Listen, Steve,

57:33.818 --> 57:35.753
Mr. Reeves wants to talk to you

57:35.820 --> 57:38.923
about something very interesting.

57:38.989 --> 57:41.526
Oh. Well, it might be kind of hard

57:41.592 --> 57:43.694
for me to see him today.

57:43.761 --> 57:48.298
I paid your rent.
Does that help?

57:48.365 --> 57:51.969
Well, yeah, that does help.

57:52.036 --> 57:53.971
Listen, Eddie, can you give me

57:54.038 --> 57:55.973
about five minutes to get dressed?

57:56.040 --> 57:58.743
Sure. Take all the time you want.

57:58.809 --> 58:00.845
I'll be right outside waiting for you.

58:00.911 --> 58:03.047
I'll be right there.

58:08.018 --> 58:11.556
See, I told you.
Our luck is changing.

58:11.622 --> 58:14.525
I think you're going to need these.

58:14.592 --> 58:16.026
Oh.

58:18.228 --> 58:19.463
Steve,

58:19.530 --> 58:21.031
don't wear pink.

58:21.098 --> 58:22.700
I won't.

58:27.304 --> 58:30.407
Goddamn it, this is a moment!

58:30.474 --> 58:33.944
I won't dick you around. We
know what you've been doing.

58:34.011 --> 58:35.212
You do?

58:35.279 --> 58:36.647
A beautiful thing.

58:36.714 --> 58:37.982
Beautiful.

58:38.048 --> 58:39.550
Beautiful.

58:41.185 --> 58:44.822
Sorry. I don't know what you
guys are talking about.

58:44.889 --> 58:47.357
[Reeves]
You can relax.
It's just us.

58:47.424 --> 58:50.327
Kick off the boots.
Drop the mask.

58:50.394 --> 58:52.529
Take off the cape.

58:53.731 --> 58:56.066
How did you find out?

58:56.133 --> 58:58.068
A little detective work.

59:02.339 --> 59:06.210
So...
What happens now?

59:06.276 --> 59:08.078
Well...

59:08.145 --> 59:09.546
We wanna help you.

59:11.315 --> 59:12.850
Help me do what?

59:12.917 --> 59:14.885
Finish what you've started.

59:14.952 --> 59:16.453
I didn't start anything.

59:16.520 --> 59:18.856
Oh, really?
Turns the city upside down,

59:18.923 --> 59:21.926
says he didn't start anything.

59:21.992 --> 59:25.395
I think the question really is
how long can you keep it up?

59:25.462 --> 59:27.632
I have to quit.
I know that.

59:27.698 --> 59:29.433
Let's talk about that.

59:29.499 --> 59:30.801
Quitting?

59:31.736 --> 59:33.370
How to do it.

59:33.437 --> 59:35.873
You can't just walk away.

59:35.940 --> 59:37.875
They'll forget you in a week.

59:37.942 --> 59:40.177
You wanna go out a legend.

59:40.244 --> 59:42.546
It was just something
that happened.

59:42.613 --> 59:44.014
Don't do that, Steve.

59:44.081 --> 59:46.383
Don't ever make little
of what you've done,

59:46.450 --> 59:47.885
even in modesty.

59:47.952 --> 59:49.586
It's too important.

59:50.988 --> 59:52.189
You see,

59:52.256 --> 59:56.393
the need you've touched
in the people of this city,

59:56.460 --> 59:57.895
the faith you've restored...

59:57.962 --> 01:00:01.198
Well, it's amazing.

01:00:01.265 --> 01:00:03.634
I don't think even you
realize what you've done,

01:00:03.701 --> 01:00:05.636
what you still can do.

01:00:05.703 --> 01:00:07.137
All it needs

01:00:07.204 --> 01:00:09.406
is a little advanced planning.

01:00:09.473 --> 01:00:11.541
You mean a setup?

01:00:11.608 --> 01:00:13.543
A performance.

01:00:13.610 --> 01:00:15.045
I can't do that.

01:00:15.112 --> 01:00:17.281
Come on.
You're an actor.

01:00:17.347 --> 01:00:18.582
If you were...

01:00:18.649 --> 01:00:20.918
If you were giving
a performance of Hamlet,

01:00:20.985 --> 01:00:22.920
would you use real swords?

01:00:22.987 --> 01:00:24.922
Yeah, but that's make-believe.

01:00:24.989 --> 01:00:26.423
What's Captain Avenger?

01:00:26.490 --> 01:00:28.125
Captain...
You ca...

01:00:28.192 --> 01:00:29.226
I... I... I know.

01:00:29.293 --> 01:00:32.529
It's a fine line.
I'll Grant you that.

01:00:32.596 --> 01:00:34.765
But you did something...

01:00:34.832 --> 01:00:36.300
Beautiful.

01:00:38.703 --> 01:00:41.138
You played Captain Avenger.

01:00:41.205 --> 01:00:44.141
To do it, you wore a costume.

01:00:44.208 --> 01:00:46.643
Does that make it less honest...

01:00:46.711 --> 01:00:48.345
Less beautiful?

01:00:49.714 --> 01:00:51.949
But I didn't fake it.

01:00:53.083 --> 01:00:55.219
Don't be selfish, Steve.

01:00:55.285 --> 01:00:57.054
Selfish?

01:01:01.225 --> 01:01:03.861
Give them what they want, Steve.

01:01:05.262 --> 01:01:06.864
Give them the legend.

01:01:14.739 --> 01:01:17.641
You know, I... I...

01:01:17.708 --> 01:01:19.676
I need some time
to think this over.

01:01:19.744 --> 01:01:21.378
Is that alright?

01:01:21.445 --> 01:01:23.213
Of course.
Absolutely.

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:24.181
Oh, good.

01:01:24.248 --> 01:01:27.384
Come on out this way.
Yeah.

01:01:27.451 --> 01:01:29.386
Take care of that arm.

01:01:29.453 --> 01:01:30.687
You play pool?

01:01:30.755 --> 01:01:32.189
Sometimes, yeah.

01:01:32.256 --> 01:01:35.392
We got a nice table here.
Take a look.

01:01:37.995 --> 01:01:40.197
Steve, I want you
to think it over.

01:01:40.264 --> 01:01:42.699
It's very important...
To all of us.

01:01:42.767 --> 01:01:44.701
Mr. Reeves,
tell me something.

01:01:44.769 --> 01:01:47.604
Why do you care
about this so much?

01:01:47.671 --> 01:01:49.807
That's a good question.

01:01:52.777 --> 01:01:54.711
Somebody has to care.

01:02:00.484 --> 01:02:04.088
Steve, you know Zev Bufman?

01:02:04.154 --> 01:02:05.355
The producer?

01:02:05.422 --> 01:02:08.558
Yeah. He's a...
He's a friend of mine.

01:02:08.625 --> 01:02:12.963
He's doing a revival of
Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,

01:02:13.030 --> 01:02:15.165
and they're looking
for a new face

01:02:15.232 --> 01:02:18.002
to play the role of...

01:02:18.068 --> 01:02:19.569
What's that character's name?

01:02:19.636 --> 01:02:21.271
Brick?

01:02:21.338 --> 01:02:22.372
That's the one.

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:25.575
Paul Newman played that part...

01:02:25.642 --> 01:02:27.177
And Ben gazzara.

01:02:27.244 --> 01:02:28.212
Well, I...

01:02:28.278 --> 01:02:30.881
I think they ought
to talk to you.

01:02:32.116 --> 01:02:33.750
Well, thanks a lot.

01:02:33.818 --> 01:02:35.285
[Steve]
Thank you very much.

01:02:35.352 --> 01:02:37.154
It's alright.

01:02:37.221 --> 01:02:39.756
Wow. I'll see you later.

01:02:44.128 --> 01:02:46.063
Linda, get me Calvin Donnelly.

01:02:46.130 --> 01:02:49.066
Hey, shouldn't you wait till
you hear back from the guy?

01:02:49.133 --> 01:02:50.567
What for?
He's hooked.

01:02:50.634 --> 01:02:52.769
Don't worry.
Just trust me.

01:02:52.837 --> 01:02:54.939
[Steve]
Mr. Reeves?

01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:59.276
I'm sorry.
I can't do it.

01:03:01.345 --> 01:03:03.280
I just can't.

01:03:03.347 --> 01:03:04.949
Thanks anyway.

01:03:46.023 --> 01:03:47.958
That looks better on you.

01:03:48.025 --> 01:03:49.426
What's all this?

01:03:49.493 --> 01:03:52.429
This is dinner!
It's the old Chinese seduction.

01:03:52.496 --> 01:03:56.233
Oh, and flowers for the
lady of the house.

01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:59.436
I bring you wondrous delights...

01:03:59.503 --> 01:04:02.806
Tender duckling steamed
with delicate spices,

01:04:02.873 --> 01:04:04.441
pressed into dainty cakes,

01:04:04.508 --> 01:04:07.644
and served with
a spicy plum sauce.

01:04:07.711 --> 01:04:09.713
Spicy plum sauce.

01:04:09.779 --> 01:04:12.449
Steve, I'm going out to dinner.

01:04:12.516 --> 01:04:14.851
You'll change your plans
once you've tasted

01:04:14.919 --> 01:04:16.954
quong how Singapore noodles.

01:04:17.021 --> 01:04:18.655
I got a job.

01:04:18.722 --> 01:04:20.824
You did?
Congratulations!

01:04:20.891 --> 01:04:21.992
Look! Look!

01:04:22.059 --> 01:04:23.160
We'll celebrate...

01:04:23.227 --> 01:04:25.695
With a wine of recent vintage,

01:04:25.762 --> 01:04:27.531
very recent vintage,

01:04:27.597 --> 01:04:29.799
but it's not too
dry, not too sweet.

01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:31.401
I'm meeting some agency people.

01:04:31.468 --> 01:04:36.673
Hold on. Fortune cookies so wise
you will gasp to read them.

01:04:36.740 --> 01:04:40.277
I can't have dinner with you.

01:04:42.279 --> 01:04:44.348
Ok.

01:04:44.414 --> 01:04:45.549
Wonton for one.

01:04:45.615 --> 01:04:47.784
I'll just watch TV
till you get home.

01:04:47.851 --> 01:04:49.753
Steve...

01:04:49.819 --> 01:04:51.855
Home is over there.

01:04:51.922 --> 01:04:56.193
The rent was paid.
The lock is off the door.

01:04:58.428 --> 01:05:00.397
Yeah, but I thought
that you and I...

01:05:00.464 --> 01:05:04.134
I thought that's
what you thought.

01:05:04.768 --> 01:05:06.570
Look...

01:05:06.636 --> 01:05:08.172
Steve...

01:05:08.238 --> 01:05:10.674
You're a terrific guy,

01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:12.376
and I like you.

01:05:12.442 --> 01:05:14.378
I like you a lot,

01:05:14.444 --> 01:05:15.679
but right now,

01:05:15.745 --> 01:05:18.715
I need some time
with me, for me.

01:05:18.782 --> 01:05:21.385
You understand?

01:05:21.451 --> 01:05:22.719
No.

01:05:22.786 --> 01:05:25.222
There are things I want to do.

01:05:25.289 --> 01:05:26.723
I wouldn't stop you.

01:05:26.790 --> 01:05:28.425
Yes, you would.

01:05:28.492 --> 01:05:31.195
You're not just another guy.

01:05:31.261 --> 01:05:33.530
You're someone to stay home with,

01:05:33.597 --> 01:05:36.333
and I don't want to stay home right now.

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:38.568
When I look at you, I see Christmas cards

01:05:38.635 --> 01:05:41.171
with kids' pictures on the front.

01:05:41.238 --> 01:05:43.407
I got a few dreams of my own.

01:05:43.473 --> 01:05:45.542
I want to do something about them.

01:05:45.609 --> 01:05:48.745
Now, when I still have the chance.

01:05:48.812 --> 01:05:50.514
I could help you.

01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:51.815
It wouldn't work.

01:05:51.881 --> 01:05:53.083
I promise...

01:05:53.150 --> 01:05:56.053
I don't want promises.

01:05:56.120 --> 01:05:57.954
Steve...

01:05:58.022 --> 01:06:01.191
There's no place for you in my life.

01:06:01.258 --> 01:06:04.528
Please... go back to your apartment.

01:06:18.175 --> 01:06:21.178
Could you open the door for me?

01:06:21.245 --> 01:06:23.713
My hands are a little greasy.

01:06:33.557 --> 01:06:35.725
Thanks, J., not just
for that, but for...

01:06:35.792 --> 01:06:37.427
I know.

01:06:48.172 --> 01:06:50.174
My fortune.

01:06:55.745 --> 01:06:57.247
What's it say?

01:06:57.314 --> 01:07:02.552
"A duck who flies upside down
may have a bad quackup."

01:07:20.404 --> 01:07:22.672
New York is going
Captain Avenger crazy.

01:07:22.739 --> 01:07:26.009
Last night, there was a report

01:07:26.076 --> 01:07:28.678
about Captain Avenger
thwarting a bank robbery.

01:07:28.745 --> 01:07:33.850
A passerby describedseeing
him rout five armed men.

01:07:33.917 --> 01:07:35.752
Now, Dr. Brothers,

01:07:35.819 --> 01:07:38.288
is this a good thing
or a bad thing

01:07:38.355 --> 01:07:40.324
in the sense of
healthy or unhealthy?

01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:43.760
Your question isn't as
simple as it sounds.

01:07:43.827 --> 01:07:46.596
On one hand, who says it's unhealthy
to admire heroic figures?

01:07:46.663 --> 01:07:48.698
[Woman]
Oh, I will.

01:07:48.765 --> 01:07:51.635
Next we'll be looking
for genies in bottles

01:07:51.701 --> 01:07:54.804
or having our fairy godmothers
take us to the ball.

01:07:54.871 --> 01:07:57.641
Doesn't the public response
to Captain Avenger

01:07:57.707 --> 01:08:00.744
indicate that the people
would like to have a hero?

01:08:00.810 --> 01:08:02.679
Of course they would.

01:08:02.746 --> 01:08:05.382
Whathappens when they
find out it's a joke?

01:08:05.449 --> 01:08:08.485
Assuming that the man
is completely Sincere,

01:08:08.552 --> 01:08:11.621
the question surely arises,
how far will he go?

01:08:11.688 --> 01:08:14.524
Isn't it inevitable
that he'll let us down?

01:08:14.591 --> 01:08:16.526
Well, he can't let us down

01:08:16.593 --> 01:08:18.662
if we don't let him set us up.

01:08:18.728 --> 01:08:21.430
You're saying
we ought to give up hope.

01:08:21.497 --> 01:08:24.667
I don't believe that
we have to give up hope.

01:08:24.734 --> 01:08:27.804
We need our hopes
as we need our fantasies.

01:08:27.871 --> 01:08:32.576
We need you, Captain
Avenger, dream and reality.

01:08:32.642 --> 01:08:34.377
Keep it up.

01:08:43.487 --> 01:08:46.156
This is a stickup!
Everybody up!

01:08:46.223 --> 01:08:47.524
Get up there! Move!

01:08:47.591 --> 01:08:50.460
Come on! Hurry!
Move it!

01:08:50.527 --> 01:08:53.296
Quiet! Everybody
to the back of the car!

01:08:53.363 --> 01:08:55.432
Sit down on each side!

01:08:55.499 --> 01:08:58.868
Quiet! Don't make
any sudden moves!

01:08:58.935 --> 01:09:00.970
Sit down back there!

01:09:01.037 --> 01:09:01.970
Everybody be quiet,

01:09:02.037 --> 01:09:04.073
nobody gets hurt.

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:05.542
Ok.

01:09:05.609 --> 01:09:08.545
Your money, rings, watches,
wallets, in that bag!

01:09:08.612 --> 01:09:09.979
Hurry up!

01:09:10.046 --> 01:09:11.481
Stick it in there!

01:09:11.548 --> 01:09:13.517
Come on, sis.
Stick it in the bag.

01:09:13.582 --> 01:09:17.120
There you go.
Pass it down the line.

01:09:17.187 --> 01:09:18.755
And your wallet!

01:09:18.822 --> 01:09:21.591
You forgot your wallet!

01:09:21.658 --> 01:09:24.961
Pass it along!
Come on! Come on!

01:09:25.028 --> 01:09:26.162
Come on!
Come on!

01:09:26.229 --> 01:09:27.430
Come on! Hurry up!

01:09:27.497 --> 01:09:29.733
I haven't got all day!
Here. Take it.

01:09:31.734 --> 01:09:34.002
Whatever you say, tough guy.

01:09:34.069 --> 01:09:35.138
Captain Avenger!

01:09:35.205 --> 01:09:37.140
Don't you want your loot?

01:09:37.207 --> 01:09:38.442
Stay there!

01:09:41.044 --> 01:09:44.381
[Man]
Get him, Captain!
Get him, Captain!

01:10:02.899 --> 01:10:05.469
Get him, Captain!

01:10:13.277 --> 01:10:15.712
Alright, everybody,
you can relax now.

01:10:15.779 --> 01:10:17.481
Everything's under control.

01:10:19.182 --> 01:10:22.218
This is the end of the line for you.

01:10:22.286 --> 01:10:24.220
Officer!

01:10:24.288 --> 01:10:26.222
We have an attempted
armed robbery here.

01:10:26.290 --> 01:10:27.957
Thank you, Captain.
I'll take over.

01:10:28.024 --> 01:10:30.059
Officer, I was a witness.

01:10:30.126 --> 01:10:32.462
Would you mind coming with me?

01:10:32.529 --> 01:10:34.398
No, I don't mind.

01:10:34.464 --> 01:10:36.633
[Policeman]
Let's move.
Come on.

01:10:37.267 --> 01:10:39.002
Great, huh?

01:10:39.068 --> 01:10:43.373
It's selling so good,
we can't keep it on the shelves.

01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:46.676
Well, I heard you were a big hit today.

01:10:51.014 --> 01:10:53.583
Listen, Mr. Reeves.
I'm not doing it anymore.

01:10:54.751 --> 01:10:57.887
I told myself
all those things were true...

01:10:57.954 --> 01:11:02.225
People needing Captain Avenger
and going out a legend.

01:11:02.292 --> 01:11:03.593
And?

01:11:04.961 --> 01:11:08.932
And I wanted a part in a play.
I wanted to be somebody.

01:11:08.998 --> 01:11:12.636
What's the harm of doing
something good for yourself?

01:11:12.702 --> 01:11:15.038
The harm is I feel lousy!

01:11:15.104 --> 01:11:20.944
When I did it before, it was
real. I felt great. Not now.

01:11:21.010 --> 01:11:22.245
Steve...

01:11:22.312 --> 01:11:24.280
You had a big day.

01:11:24.348 --> 01:11:26.249
Why don't you go home, relax,

01:11:26.316 --> 01:11:28.017
think it over?

01:11:28.084 --> 01:11:30.019
No, I thought it over. No.

01:11:30.086 --> 01:11:32.255
We have an agreement.

01:11:32.322 --> 01:11:34.658
I haven't collected my part.

01:11:34.724 --> 01:11:36.760
Alright.
Now, wait a minute.

01:11:36.826 --> 01:11:38.762
Steve, hold on a second.

01:11:38.828 --> 01:11:40.764
Something you should know about.

01:11:40.830 --> 01:11:43.767
The mayor's office has
been in touch with me.

01:11:43.833 --> 01:11:46.269
They want to have a
Captain Avenger day.

01:11:46.336 --> 01:11:47.537
Not bad, huh?

01:11:47.604 --> 01:11:49.072
With television coverage.

01:11:49.138 --> 01:11:53.076
Everyone will get to see you.
Really see you.

01:11:53.142 --> 01:11:57.881
I mean, listen, if you...
if you want to quit, ok,

01:11:57.947 --> 01:12:01.351
but it's a nice way
to go out, isn't it?

01:12:04.621 --> 01:12:08.057
Alright, but that will
be the last time.

01:12:08.124 --> 01:12:10.627
You bet. I'll send a car for you.

01:12:10.694 --> 01:12:11.661
Uh...

01:12:13.630 --> 01:12:16.633
Uh, no, thanks.
I'll get there on my own.

01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:19.035
I'd rather send you a car.

01:12:20.103 --> 01:12:23.106
I promise.
I'll be there.

01:12:23.172 --> 01:12:24.574
[Door closes]

01:12:27.911 --> 01:12:30.046
Thanks so much.

01:12:33.617 --> 01:12:35.051
You're crazy.

01:12:35.118 --> 01:12:37.554
You know that, don't you?

01:12:37.621 --> 01:12:40.857
Uh, yeah.
I heard it a couple of times.

01:12:40.924 --> 01:12:42.859
Armed robbers on elevated trains?

01:12:42.926 --> 01:12:45.562
Have you decided you really
are Captain Avenger?

01:12:45.629 --> 01:12:47.063
Not doing it again.

01:12:47.130 --> 01:12:49.265
That's what you said last time.

01:12:49.332 --> 01:12:50.767
Maybe it's an addiction.

01:12:50.834 --> 01:12:52.869
Oh, come on, don't do that.

01:12:52.936 --> 01:12:55.304
I should turn you in
for your own good!

01:12:55.371 --> 01:12:57.441
Hey, you don't want
to deal with me.

01:12:57.507 --> 01:12:59.976
You got other things
to do, remember?

01:13:01.344 --> 01:13:03.279
I should have expected that.

01:13:03.346 --> 01:13:04.648
Oh, well.

01:13:06.583 --> 01:13:09.018
I haven't seen you for days.

01:13:09.085 --> 01:13:10.520
I've been busy.

01:13:10.587 --> 01:13:12.355
Riding around
on elevated trains.

01:13:12.422 --> 01:13:15.625
Tomorrow I'm leaping over a tall
building in a single bound.

01:13:15.692 --> 01:13:17.561
Wrong guy.
I'm expanding.

01:13:17.627 --> 01:13:20.564
Go ahead and get yourself killed.

01:13:20.630 --> 01:13:22.932
Just don't come and tell me about it.

01:13:26.670 --> 01:13:28.838
Hey, toots.
You want to put that in there?

01:13:28.905 --> 01:13:31.475
You might want to check
out the big C.A.

01:13:31.541 --> 01:13:33.309
He really did it this time.

01:13:33.376 --> 01:13:36.646
So I heard.
So I heard.

01:13:36.713 --> 01:13:38.648
"Suddenly he appeared"?

01:13:38.715 --> 01:13:40.650
How the hell does somebody

01:13:40.717 --> 01:13:43.352
suddenly appear
on a moving train?

01:13:43.419 --> 01:13:45.855
20 witnesses say so.
That's how.

01:13:45.922 --> 01:13:47.356
20 witnesses.

01:13:47.423 --> 01:13:49.158
"It's the idea that counts."

01:13:49.225 --> 01:13:52.361
He even stopped to
make a speech, Gloria.

01:13:52.428 --> 01:13:54.498
Yeah.

01:13:54.564 --> 01:13:57.333
Seems like I heard that speech before.

01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:59.869
See you in the funny papers, honey.

01:13:59.936 --> 01:14:01.638
Taxi! Taxi!

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:07.076
[Band playing]

01:14:16.620 --> 01:14:18.688
This is your better idea...

01:14:18.755 --> 01:14:20.690
Forget about the fake heroics?

01:14:20.757 --> 01:14:24.393
Have a ceremony.
Give him the key to the city.

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:26.395
Enough coverage for two elections.

01:14:26.462 --> 01:14:27.697
What have we got,

01:14:27.764 --> 01:14:29.432
a disappearing act instead?

01:14:29.499 --> 01:14:31.901
He said he would be here.

01:14:38.174 --> 01:14:40.877
I'm afraid we just have to start.

01:14:43.412 --> 01:14:45.048
Without him?

01:14:45.114 --> 01:14:47.917
We don't know what's happened.

01:14:47.984 --> 01:14:50.186
You got me into this, Calvin.

01:14:50.253 --> 01:14:52.255
[Donnelly]
I'm sorry, your honor.

01:14:52.321 --> 01:14:53.957
I am not happy.

01:14:55.491 --> 01:14:58.628

Ladies and gentlemen!

01:15:07.871 --> 01:15:10.439
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:15:10.506 --> 01:15:14.310
the mayor of New York City!

01:15:14.377 --> 01:15:16.813
[Crowd booing]

01:15:21.484 --> 01:15:23.252
Through the years,

01:15:23.319 --> 01:15:26.856
many heroes have been honored
on these steps,

01:15:26.923 --> 01:15:29.458
none of them more extraordinary

01:15:29.525 --> 01:15:31.995
than the one we honor today.

01:15:35.999 --> 01:15:38.935
[Mayor]
I wish that he had seen fit

01:15:39.002 --> 01:15:41.705
to accept this tribute in person.

01:15:41.771 --> 01:15:44.808
[Crowd booing]

01:15:46.209 --> 01:15:48.077
I can only hope...

01:15:48.144 --> 01:15:50.346
I can only hope

01:15:50.413 --> 01:15:53.016
that wherever he is,

01:15:53.082 --> 01:15:57.486
he can hear our heartfelt
expression of gratitude.

01:15:57.553 --> 01:16:00.690
[Crowd booing]

01:16:03.126 --> 01:16:06.863

You are a bum! You are a bum!

01:16:06.930 --> 01:16:09.565
[Mayor]
I only hope... I only hope...

01:16:09.633 --> 01:16:13.036
[Crowd]
We want Captain Avenger!

01:16:13.102 --> 01:16:15.504
We want Captain Avenger!
We want Captain Avenger!

01:16:59.282 --> 01:17:00.316
Thank you.

01:17:08.091 --> 01:17:12.295
I don't want you to think that I don't
appreciate this honor you're paying me,

01:17:12.361 --> 01:17:15.598
the mayor and all of you.

01:17:15.665 --> 01:17:17.967
Thank you.

01:17:18.034 --> 01:17:20.670
But, you see,
I didn't come here for that.

01:17:20.737 --> 01:17:24.874
I came here
because I have something to say,

01:17:24.941 --> 01:17:27.476
and this is a chance to say it

01:17:27.543 --> 01:17:30.513
to a lot of people all at once.

01:17:30.579 --> 01:17:34.450
But what I want to say is...

01:17:34.517 --> 01:17:39.588
That I don't really
matter very much.

01:17:39.655 --> 01:17:41.624
That's not true.

01:17:41.691 --> 01:17:43.092
We love you.

01:17:43.159 --> 01:17:44.527
[Steve]
No, no, no.

01:17:44.593 --> 01:17:48.097
You see, I don't really
matter very much...

01:17:48.164 --> 01:17:50.133
Who I am or where I come from,

01:17:50.199 --> 01:17:52.836
or if I'll ever show up again.

01:17:52.902 --> 01:17:57.774
It's what Captain Avenger stands for.
That's what's important.

01:17:58.641 --> 01:18:00.443
[Audience clapping and cheering]

01:18:00.509 --> 01:18:03.913
That's what's important,

01:18:03.980 --> 01:18:05.915
and he stands for justice...

01:18:05.982 --> 01:18:07.817
[Audience cheering]

01:18:07.884 --> 01:18:09.085

01:18:11.988 --> 01:18:13.823
[Audience cheering louder]

01:18:13.890 --> 01:18:15.591
Those things still exist.

01:18:15.658 --> 01:18:17.426
[Audience cheering]

01:18:19.328 --> 01:18:21.798
[Man]
God bless you!

01:18:23.166 --> 01:18:26.235
And there are heroes everywhere
if you look for them,

01:18:26.302 --> 01:18:29.505
and not just guys
in flashy costumes

01:18:29.572 --> 01:18:31.941
and comic book names

01:18:32.008 --> 01:18:37.246
but people...
Next-door, down the block...

01:18:37.313 --> 01:18:42.351
People putting themselves
on the line for other people,

01:18:42.418 --> 01:18:43.386
caring.

01:18:44.754 --> 01:18:46.389
[Man]
People like you!

01:18:46.455 --> 01:18:47.690
And people like you!

01:18:47.757 --> 01:18:50.426
[Audience clapping and cheering]

01:18:50.493 --> 01:18:53.496
It's people putting themselves
on the line for other people,

01:18:53.562 --> 01:18:56.599
caring, that's what being a hero is.

01:18:56.665 --> 01:18:58.467

What a world that would be?

Right on!

01:19:18.421 --> 01:19:19.388
And...

01:19:23.159 --> 01:19:27.363
I'm not used to
giving speeches, but, uh...

01:19:27.430 --> 01:19:30.599
That's all I have to say,
and I think it's enough.

01:19:30.666 --> 01:19:32.802
Thank you for listening.

Just a few words for
our viewers at home.

01:20:16.379 --> 01:20:18.848
No. Not now.
I can't. I'm sorry.

01:20:18.915 --> 01:20:21.450
I'd like to talk to you, Steve.

01:20:23.052 --> 01:20:25.588
Uh, I better go now.
Thank you. I'm sorry.

01:20:25.654 --> 01:20:28.457
This is Gloria Preston,
WNYB, from city hall,

01:20:28.524 --> 01:20:31.995
where I am attempting to get an
interview from Captain Avenger,

01:20:32.061 --> 01:20:34.730
the man being honored here today,

01:20:34.797 --> 01:20:37.867
or should I say Steve Nichols...

01:20:37.934 --> 01:20:40.736
A small-town, out-of-work actor

01:20:40.803 --> 01:20:42.771
performing rehearsed...

01:20:42.838 --> 01:20:48.544
Performing rehearsed
heroics to sell a movie

01:20:48.611 --> 01:20:53.582
and maybe...
And maybe even a politician.

01:20:59.155 --> 01:21:01.757
Mr. Mayor, I think we ought to leave.

01:21:01.824 --> 01:21:02.992
I have...

01:21:03.059 --> 01:21:04.560
Wait a minute, people!

I have with me...

01:21:09.999 --> 01:21:13.937
I have with me another actor...

01:21:14.003 --> 01:21:16.139
The so-called holdup man.

01:21:16.205 --> 01:21:18.507
This man is prepared to admit

01:21:18.574 --> 01:21:21.077
that the whole train
robbery was staged

01:21:21.144 --> 01:21:24.513
and it is as phony as
Captain Avenger himself.

distorting information.

Is it fake?

01:21:38.094 --> 01:21:39.428
Is it fake?

01:21:39.495 --> 01:21:41.998
No. Not at first,
but later on...

01:21:42.065 --> 01:21:43.866
Not at first?

01:21:43.933 --> 01:21:45.101
It was a fake!

01:21:45.168 --> 01:21:47.270
It's not me.
I'm not important.

01:21:47.336 --> 01:21:49.705
It's what Captain Avenger stands for.

01:21:49.772 --> 01:21:52.841
What the hell are you
talking about, you fake?

01:21:52.908 --> 01:21:55.244
It doesn't matter
what you think of me.

01:21:55.311 --> 01:21:57.246

01:22:27.043 --> 01:22:28.677
Were you involved?

01:22:28.744 --> 01:22:31.914
Did he hide in your apartment?

01:22:31.981 --> 01:22:34.917
Do you expect him to contact you?

01:22:34.984 --> 01:22:36.485
I don't know anything.

01:22:36.552 --> 01:22:38.988
Did you know before today that he's a fraud?

01:22:39.055 --> 01:22:40.990
Some say he should be arrested.

01:22:41.057 --> 01:22:42.458
Arrested?

01:22:42.525 --> 01:22:46.929
[Woman]
Did you know a P.R. firm
told him what to do?

01:22:46.996 --> 01:22:48.931
Did you suspect he was a phony?

01:22:48.998 --> 01:22:50.933
He wasn't a phony.

01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:52.935
How did this all happen?

01:22:53.002 --> 01:22:54.970
The man I knew was real.

01:22:55.038 --> 01:22:57.740
The bullet wound
in his arm was real,

01:22:57.806 --> 01:23:01.277
and what he believed in,
that was real, too.

01:23:01.344 --> 01:23:03.346
How did you find all of this out?

01:23:03.412 --> 01:23:05.314
That's all I have to say.

01:23:05.381 --> 01:23:10.186
I have a mean knee. If you don't want
to sing soprano, I suggest you move.

job as Captain Avenger.

Get that basket up there right away!

01:28:30.839 --> 01:28:33.609
Come on! Hurry!
Get it moving!

01:28:33.676 --> 01:28:36.111
Take it easy. Come on.
Move it up there.

01:28:36.178 --> 01:28:37.312
Quick!

01:28:37.380 --> 01:28:40.248
Keep it moving.
Keep it moving!

01:28:40.315 --> 01:28:43.619
Please stay calm, lady.
We're coming up to get you.

01:28:43.686 --> 01:28:46.755
[Woman]
Help us!
Help, please!

01:28:46.822 --> 01:28:50.325
My baby!
My boy's in there.

01:28:50.393 --> 01:28:53.028
Help! Help!
I can't find him!

01:28:53.095 --> 01:28:55.297
I can't find him!

01:28:55.364 --> 01:28:58.100
[Fireman]
The fireman will help you.

01:28:58.166 --> 01:29:00.102
Do you have my baby?

01:29:00.168 --> 01:29:02.705
Where is he?

01:29:05.273 --> 01:29:08.677
I want our people
out of that building right now!

01:29:08.744 --> 01:29:10.178
[Woman]
Where's my baby?

01:29:10.245 --> 01:29:12.781
Dead! He's dead!

01:29:15.418 --> 01:29:18.086
[Fireman]
Don't worry, now.
You're ok.

01:29:19.788 --> 01:29:20.523
Come on!

01:29:20.589 --> 01:29:22.024
Move it! Move it!

01:29:22.090 --> 01:29:25.528
Get out! I want everybody,
and I mean everybody...

01:29:25.594 --> 01:29:28.096
Johnny! Johnny!

01:29:28.163 --> 01:29:31.767
Johnny! Johnny?

01:29:31.834 --> 01:29:32.601
Easy. Easy.

01:29:32.668 --> 01:29:34.903
You're going to be alright.

01:29:34.970 --> 01:29:38.206
He's up there!
My baby's up there!

01:29:38.273 --> 01:29:39.908
Where's my son?

01:29:39.975 --> 01:29:42.611
Have you seen my little boy?

01:29:42.678 --> 01:29:44.480
Johnny! Johnny!

01:29:44.547 --> 01:29:45.914
I'm going in there!

01:29:45.981 --> 01:29:48.551
You can't!
It's too dangerous.

01:29:48.617 --> 01:29:50.753
[Woman yelling indistinctly]

01:29:52.821 --> 01:29:55.223
Please find him.
Will you find him?

01:29:55.290 --> 01:29:58.226
Please! He's up there!

01:29:58.293 --> 01:30:01.630
Johnny! Johnny!

01:30:01.697 --> 01:30:04.433
My boy's up there.
My boy's up there.

01:30:09.538 --> 01:30:12.007
Nobody goes back in that
building, understood?

01:30:22.651 --> 01:30:25.420
[Gloria]
...A young boy is still
trapped in the building.

01:30:25.488 --> 01:30:27.222
All rescue efforts have been stopped

01:30:27.289 --> 01:30:30.125
due to the imminent danger
of further collapse.

01:30:30.192 --> 01:30:34.129
Both fire and rescue crews
have been ordered to stay out.

01:30:34.196 --> 01:30:37.232
Chief Palmer faces
a very difficult decision...

01:30:37.299 --> 01:30:41.336
Whether he should
risk the lives of his own men

01:30:41.403 --> 01:30:43.138
or to stand by helplessly

01:30:43.205 --> 01:30:46.642
while a boy is trapped
in a potential time bomb.

01:30:46.709 --> 01:30:50.012
What the hell is that?
Get a light up there!

01:30:50.078 --> 01:30:51.647
Jesus Christ!

01:30:51.714 --> 01:30:54.883
[Woman]
It's Captain Avenger!

01:31:19.074 --> 01:31:21.777
[Hissing]

01:31:26.782 --> 01:31:28.150
[Steve]
Is anybody there?

01:31:28.216 --> 01:31:30.052
Yes.

01:31:35.457 --> 01:31:37.560
It's going to be alright.

01:31:37.626 --> 01:31:39.628
[Steve]
Let's get out of here.
Let's go!

01:31:39.695 --> 01:31:42.164
Come on.
Here we go.

01:31:44.466 --> 01:31:46.802
Grab on tight grab on tight.

01:31:47.936 --> 01:31:50.606
I'm going to get you out of here.

01:31:51.674 --> 01:31:53.341
[Hissing]

01:31:53.408 --> 01:31:55.911
Will he find him, or will...

01:31:57.880 --> 01:32:00.015
He's got the kid!

01:32:00.082 --> 01:32:03.385
[Fireman]
Captain Moore, bring out the net!

01:32:03.451 --> 01:32:04.787
Get that net here!

01:32:04.853 --> 01:32:07.155
Move it!
Move it in there!

01:32:08.223 --> 01:32:10.258
Drop the child first.

01:32:10.325 --> 01:32:13.161
Give us a moment to reset,
then you jump!

01:32:13.228 --> 01:32:14.597
Alright!

01:32:19.367 --> 01:32:20.903
Oh, Johnny!

01:32:24.306 --> 01:32:26.308
Now! Are you ready?

01:32:26.374 --> 01:32:27.876
I'm ready!

01:32:32.047 --> 01:32:33.015
Steve!

01:32:34.082 --> 01:32:36.451
No! I know
he's still alive!

01:32:36.518 --> 01:32:38.286
[Sobbing]

01:32:44.627 --> 01:32:46.328
I'm going in!

01:32:46.394 --> 01:32:48.030
[Man]
You can't!

01:32:48.096 --> 01:32:50.032
Stop me!
Me, too!

01:32:58.406 --> 01:32:59.675
Where are you going?

01:32:59.742 --> 01:33:00.909
I'll go in?

01:33:00.976 --> 01:33:04.179
No. You take over here.
I'm going in.

01:33:04.246 --> 01:33:06.649
Get these vehicles out of here!

01:33:54.462 --> 01:33:56.098
[Man]
There he is!

01:33:56.164 --> 01:33:59.668
[Crowd cheering]

01:34:10.578 --> 01:34:11.880
[J.]
Steve!

01:34:17.185 --> 01:34:18.420
You ok?

01:34:20.088 --> 01:34:22.024
I love you!

01:34:28.997 --> 01:34:31.967
I'm alright.
I'll be ok.

01:34:37.405 --> 01:34:41.243
Let's go home.
Let's go home. Ok?

01:34:45.247 --> 01:34:46.348
Please.

01:34:50.853 --> 01:34:52.988
[Woman]
God bless you.

01:34:58.560 --> 01:34:59.928
[Man]
It's him, isn't it?

01:34:59.995 --> 01:35:02.564
The same guy from the movie house.

01:35:02.630 --> 01:35:05.968
You know, I guess it
doesn't matter who it is.
