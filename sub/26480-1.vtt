01:02.319 --> 01:04.428
7 MONTS EARLIER...

01:17.977 --> 01:19.769
See you around, Chambers.

01:24.216 --> 01:27.550
Come on, come on, come on. Where
you at, where you at, where you at?

01:35.194 --> 01:37.984
Ha, ha, ha!
You didn't forget it!

01:39.765 --> 01:42.602
I missed you so
much, little boy!

01:43.135 --> 01:45.794
Oh, look at you.
Bootsie!

01:48.207 --> 01:49.938
What the... what is this?

01:50.776 --> 01:52.979
Gah!

01:52.979 --> 01:55.217
Let's get in here, boy;
let's get out, come on!

02:09.829 --> 02:12.583
I can't wait to see
the R.V. you got us.

02:12.618 --> 02:15.246
Yeah. It's a little beat up,
but it'll get us to Big Sur.

02:15.368 --> 02:17.054
Good job, son.

02:31.984 --> 02:33.986
Dad...

02:33.986 --> 02:36.776
I don't have a good
feeling about this.

02:43.829 --> 02:46.536
Hey, this won't
take long.

02:47.933 --> 02:49.729
You don't have to do this.

02:52.972 --> 02:54.479
Yeah, I do.

02:55.174 --> 02:57.413
Why? 
- Why?

02:57.710 --> 03:00.271
Because if I don't,
the trouble's gonna find me.

03:00.346 --> 03:05.799
And I gotta cut it clean.
- Dady... - Stop, listen.

03:07.053 --> 03:08.654
One more time.

03:09.288 --> 03:12.637
I promise, one more
time. And we're free.

03:13.208 --> 03:15.987
Okay?
- You've said that before.

03:19.065 --> 03:23.005
This time is different.
- Said that too.

03:29.441 --> 03:30.865
I'll be back.

04:26.932 --> 04:28.334
Well, boys.

04:29.835 --> 04:32.338
The prodigal son
has returned.

04:36.442 --> 04:39.700
Um... - Mr. Gates,
the three of us...

04:40.379 --> 04:42.424
the three of us, we're out.

04:47.353 --> 04:51.330
What's that? - That's...  that's
the amount from the last gig.

04:53.025 --> 04:54.927
There should be enough in
there to cover what I owe you.

04:54.927 --> 04:56.402
Where you think
you're gonna go?

04:56.796 --> 04:58.364
What do you think
you're gonna do?

04:58.998 --> 05:02.446
You're cons.
- Ex...

05:02.468 --> 05:05.077
Ex-cons.
- Ex-cons.

05:05.337 --> 05:10.891
Sorry, sunshine. But the world's not
gonna see you like that. Like an ex-con.

05:10.943 --> 05:13.564
I just want a second
shot with me and my boy.

05:13.600 --> 05:15.684
That's just heart-breaking.

05:16.015 --> 05:19.915
But what you all need
ain't gonna fit in that bag.

05:20.906 --> 05:23.457
Come on, dad.
Hurry up.

05:35.167 --> 05:39.714
Forget this. - I understand but...
we just don't want any bloodshed.

05:40.206 --> 05:41.404
Mr. Gates...

05:42.274 --> 05:46.104
we appreciate everything you've
done, we're grateful. - You're grateful?

05:46.139 --> 05:48.808
But we've changed.
- Changed?

05:48.914 --> 05:52.852
You want out. Think about
the things that we've seen

05:52.852 --> 05:54.937
and we've done together.

05:56.088 --> 05:59.531
Oh, no. There's no getting out.

05:59.892 --> 06:02.306
Let me tell a story.

06:03.596 --> 06:05.687
When I was a kid
growing up in Scotland,

06:06.298 --> 06:09.826
my old man used
to breed chickens.

06:10.603 --> 06:13.962
One night when he
was on his usual bender,

06:14.039 --> 06:17.114
I heard this noise
coming from the hen house.

06:17.476 --> 06:20.899
And it was this red
fox standing there

06:21.180 --> 06:23.743
with a hen in his mouth.

06:25.017 --> 06:29.732
So I raised up my end field
and I had him in my sights.

06:32.258 --> 06:34.118
Aye, he was there.

06:36.629 --> 06:39.645
I couldn't pull the trigger.

06:40.165 --> 06:41.771
Couldn't do it.

06:43.002 --> 06:45.671
So the next day...

06:45.671 --> 06:51.501
daddy dear, is standing waiting
for me... with a leather strap.

06:53.679 --> 06:56.576
And he beat me with
that thing for an hour.

06:58.284 --> 07:02.484
So later that night,
when the fox came back

07:03.956 --> 07:07.144
I opened up the coop
and I let him in.

07:08.160 --> 07:12.593
And he killed every
one of them chickens.

07:12.965 --> 07:16.851
And that was the last
fox I ever let away.

07:17.670 --> 07:19.902
Mr. Gates please.

07:20.172 --> 07:22.361
We just want
a clean slate, okay?

07:22.474 --> 07:24.722
I did what you
asked us to do.

07:26.512 --> 07:27.801
Please.

07:51.303 --> 07:53.217
Sleep tight, you two.

07:56.175 --> 07:59.659
You're wondering why
you're still alive, aren't ya?

08:00.079 --> 08:05.181
I got one more job for you.
- Never! - Oh, I think you will. - Dad?

08:05.317 --> 08:07.652
Stop, son stop!
- Whoa, little leak.

08:13.258 --> 08:17.763
You do this job for me,
you and the boy get to live.

08:17.763 --> 08:22.569
My boy has nothing to do
with this. - Well, that's a shame.

08:22.604 --> 08:26.160
Then the boy has to die
for the sins of his father.

08:27.740 --> 08:30.689
Shoot him.
- No, no! Stop, don't!

08:32.778 --> 08:35.120
I'll do it.
- Dad!

08:36.615 --> 08:39.049
Of course you will.

08:40.119 --> 08:41.520
Good boy.

08:47.899 --> 08:50.513
LEGAL ACTION

08:52.765 --> 08:54.700
NASHVILE, TENNESSEE
Parker, we don't have to do this.

08:54.700 --> 08:57.906
You can drop the criminal
charges, and we can all just walk away.

08:58.404 --> 09:02.112
What are you talking
about? - May I? - Please.

09:08.147 --> 09:09.823
What is this?

09:10.115 --> 09:12.958
That's the number my client's
prepared to sue your client for.

09:14.720 --> 09:19.251
You see... he feels this number's
necessary to ease the pain and suffering 

09:19.286 --> 09:21.516
and the injuries
he sustained from his fall.

09:27.066 --> 09:28.358
You crack me up.

09:29.060 --> 09:32.260
See, this is about the criminal
charges of shoplifting against your client,

09:32.738 --> 09:34.607
not some drummed up civil case.

09:34.642 --> 09:36.567
You and I are just
having a friendly discourse,

09:36.575 --> 09:38.062
Before we pass
the point of no return.

09:38.063 --> 09:40.702
I just think you don't want to go
to trial 'cause you know you'll lose.

09:42.214 --> 09:43.599
What's your win
streak up to? - 39.

09:44.249 --> 09:46.287
Wow. - But the
point I want to make...

09:47.286 --> 09:49.154
Is that my client
slipped on a wet floor

09:49.903 --> 09:53.126
owe your client
National electronic retail stores.

09:53.161 --> 09:54.933
Casey, he still TV.

09:55.348 --> 09:56.731
It's not robbing if you
never leave the store.

09:57.830 --> 09:59.025
I'm not stealing this pen.

09:59.765 --> 10:02.506
I'm merely holding it,
openly in your presence

10:03.168 --> 10:05.313
Without any current
objections from you.

10:05.737 --> 10:08.996
The janitor will testify that he
was running for the exit. That's intent.

10:09.325 --> 10:11.966
Yeah, but aren't the cash
registers right by the exit?

10:12.377 --> 10:14.239
I think we'll take
our chances in court.

10:15.347 --> 10:18.550
Parker, what did the janitor
say to my client immediately

10:18.550 --> 10:19.646
after the accident?

10:20.686 --> 10:21.958
I'm looking.

10:23.322 --> 10:25.566
His first words
were, "I'm sorry."

10:26.859 --> 10:28.854
"I'm sorry, I forgot the sign."

10:29.236 --> 10:31.684
The big, yellow warning
sign that never left his cart.

10:32.331 --> 10:35.540
Now an employee of your
client apologized to my client

10:35.575 --> 10:37.028
moments after the incident.

10:37.169 --> 10:40.979
And he knew that he had duty
of care to place that sign out

10:41.747 --> 10:43.850
So customers would
know that that floor was wet.

10:45.244 --> 10:48.729
Now I suggest you drop those charges
before this becomes  an actual lawsuit.

10:52.518 --> 10:55.007
Like I said, we can
all just walk away.

10:57.589 --> 10:59.654
Oh... don't forget this.

11:04.296 --> 11:05.915
40... - Have a
good day, Parker.

11:08.934 --> 11:11.524
Before you go
and thank me, don't.

11:12.804 --> 11:14.148
I didn't do you any favors.

11:14.640 --> 11:16.730
I was assigned to you
because you didn't have a lawyer.

11:16.842 --> 11:19.240
I did what was my
legal responsibility.

11:19.411 --> 11:21.295
Everyone's entitled
to a vigorous defense.

11:21.413 --> 11:23.720
But let's get one
thing straight here, Polo...

11:24.216 --> 11:26.385
if you end up back in court
again, I am not gonna be here

11:26.385 --> 11:28.392
to save your
sorry tail. - Nope!

11:28.854 --> 11:30.615
Don't even think about suing.

11:30.622 --> 11:33.030
A second chance is worth
a lot more than money.

11:34.593 --> 11:35.647
Now go on, get.

12:21.873 --> 12:25.435
After ten years I would've at least
thought you'd have changed the locks.

12:26.545 --> 12:27.526
Pru.

12:28.436 --> 12:29.848
You know, you
always did have a knack

12:30.119 --> 12:31.271
for being one
step ahead of me.

12:38.023 --> 12:39.536
My brother's in trouble.

12:40.993 --> 12:42.734
He's always in trouble.
- Not like this.

12:44.496 --> 12:46.463
What's Jay gotten
himself into this time?

12:47.866 --> 12:48.990
It's murder.

12:50.736 --> 12:51.614
Murder?

12:52.771 --> 12:55.765
Who'd he go and kill?
- District attorney.

12:56.541 --> 12:58.076
A D.A., huh?

12:58.844 --> 13:00.644
Your brother's hit
the big time, babe.

13:01.404 --> 13:03.862
The arraignment's on monday.
- Back in Cherokee Hills?

13:09.588 --> 13:10.815
I didn't know
where else to go.

13:19.998 --> 13:21.671
How's your winning streak?

13:22.534 --> 13:23.495
39.

13:24.036 --> 13:25.862
Well, I'm glad our
divorce wasn't for nothing.

13:26.830 --> 13:28.583
Pru, now listen.
- Will you defend him or not?

13:31.743 --> 13:33.097
You're the best lawyer I know.

13:38.016 --> 13:39.480
You want me to
defend your brother,

13:40.886 --> 13:43.519
the same brother that
we've given a small fortune to?

13:45.057 --> 13:48.839
The brother who we bailed
out, dropped off, taken in

13:48.874 --> 13:51.863
and rescued more times
than a dog's had fleas? - Yeah.

13:53.336 --> 13:57.535
You remember the time he stayed over
and stole my grandmother's silver? - Yeah.

13:57.969 --> 13:59.597
Yeah, remember the
time he took mr. Darcy...

13:59.638 --> 14:01.943
Okay look, my list is longer
than yours, okay Casey? - Right.

14:02.908 --> 14:04.409
But, Jay's family.

14:05.344 --> 14:07.079
His whole life's
been on a downhill roll.

14:07.079 --> 14:09.157
Are you really surprised
that this is where he's landed?

14:11.350 --> 14:12.630
Still wearing your watch.

14:14.019 --> 14:17.096
I remember buying it for you.
- It stopped working a year ago.

14:18.423 --> 14:20.056
So why don't you
just get a new one?

14:22.728 --> 14:24.191
Some things are
worth hanging onto.

14:25.997 --> 14:28.559
Besides I'd rather get it fixed.

14:33.839 --> 14:34.909
Well...

14:35.607 --> 14:39.644
you may look different but...
you haven't changed a lick.

14:40.145 --> 14:42.432
Still too busy.
- Pru...

14:47.919 --> 14:50.502
What good's a winning streak
if you're not willing to risk it?

14:54.926 --> 14:56.311
Thank you, Casey.

16:08.467 --> 16:11.860
We've got a 10-91 at the court house.
Suspect, Jay Chambers, in custody.

16:27.752 --> 16:30.717
Books, bibles, magazines.

16:31.189 --> 16:33.215
Can I get you
anything before lights out?

16:35.827 --> 16:38.431
I got The sands of time.

16:38.997 --> 16:40.912
I got Jonah and the whale.

16:43.902 --> 16:46.464
Crime and punishment.

16:47.572 --> 16:49.887
Crime and punishment, brother.

16:56.715 --> 16:58.991
Hey, you tell Gates I did
everything he asked, alright?

16:59.551 --> 17:01.456
I did everything that he asked.

17:01.953 --> 17:04.223
Well then, you just
keep on playing the game.

17:04.789 --> 17:07.105
Yeah, that ain't part of the deal.
- 'Cause you got caught.

17:10.929 --> 17:12.098
Now...

17:13.231 --> 17:15.724
you don't talk
to no lawyers.

17:16.034 --> 17:17.828
Don't titter-tatter to your sister.

17:19.204 --> 17:21.167
You know we'll
know if you do.

17:23.097 --> 17:24.240
If you do...

17:25.577 --> 17:26.573
well...

17:27.656 --> 17:29.615
you know what
I'm gonna have to do.

17:31.816 --> 17:34.786
Where's Kit?
Where's my boy?

17:34.786 --> 17:37.448
Where is my boy?
- Oof!

17:42.561 --> 17:43.600
Safe.

17:44.796 --> 17:46.517
Just like a little
bird in the hand.

17:47.599 --> 17:51.339
If you lay one hand on my boy,
okay... one hand and I will rip your...

17:51.374 --> 17:53.680
Oh, you're gonna rip my?
- What are you gonna do?

17:55.106 --> 17:56.519
Go on a hunger strike?

17:58.176 --> 18:01.270
You gonna write the lawyers?
Gonna speak to the governor?

18:05.617 --> 18:09.614
You know, we know that you got
an outside pinch-hitter coming in...

18:10.355 --> 18:11.521
Your brother in law.

18:12.057 --> 18:14.096
I've always hated lawyers.

18:14.659 --> 18:17.360
Please, please just

18:17.862 --> 18:19.703
give me a half
a reason to hurt him.

18:28.707 --> 18:30.642
Sleep sweet.

18:34.946 --> 18:37.682
Hey! - Books, bibles,
magazines. - Hey!

18:40.218 --> 18:43.369
Books, bibles, magazines.

18:44.956 --> 18:47.280
Books, bibles, magazines.

20:17.415 --> 20:21.123
You look lost.
- No, just calibrating.

20:21.319 --> 20:23.555
Looking for the courtroom
where they're holding Chambers case.

20:23.852 --> 20:26.554
Ben Wingwright, just
sworn in as special prosecutor.

20:26.858 --> 20:29.049
Oh! Casey McKay, defense counsel.

20:29.494 --> 20:30.795
Did they bring you in
from another county?

20:31.050 --> 20:32.779
No, brought me
in from retirement.

20:33.042 --> 20:35.762
I was fishing in the Ozarks.
- Really? - Yeah, yeah.

20:36.267 --> 20:39.370
They brought in judge
Thorne from two counties over

20:39.370 --> 20:41.959
For the case, too.
Good luck with that.

20:43.241 --> 20:44.905
Courtroom's upstairs.

20:49.214 --> 20:51.277
I've always loved
this courtroom;

20:51.312 --> 20:53.590
It's a thing of beauty.

20:54.753 --> 20:56.862
The windows are
the original panes,

20:56.897 --> 20:58.829
the seats were refurbished

20:59.057 --> 21:02.237
From the original bleachers
of fenway park. Go figure.

21:09.768 --> 21:11.635
I'm glad to have run
into you, mr. Wingwright.

21:11.836 --> 21:13.683
Please, Ben's easier.
- Ben.

21:13.972 --> 21:17.043
I was thinking that before iI met
with my client here... - He's kin, isn't he?

21:18.877 --> 21:22.378
He is, by association. He just
sorta came with the ex-wife.

21:22.814 --> 21:24.321
So it's a favor to her.

21:24.349 --> 21:26.568
I was hoping to test
the waters on a plea deal.

21:28.264 --> 21:29.978
25?
- Hmm.

21:31.322 --> 21:34.273
40? Be out in 20.

21:34.959 --> 21:36.089
Hm.

21:36.928 --> 21:39.616
How about plea
guilty to trespassing and

21:39.798 --> 21:43.170
carrying an illegal firearm?
- You're looking for a leg to stand on.

21:43.935 --> 21:46.233
Don't you care that
justice is done at all?

21:46.471 --> 21:47.381
That's why I'm here.

21:47.447 --> 21:49.541
Everyone's innocent
till proven guilty.

21:49.541 --> 21:51.910
And as far as I'm
concerned, he's already standing.

21:51.910 --> 21:54.901
Well, mr. McKay call me
old fashioned but I think

21:55.697 --> 21:58.624
we ought to let
truth decide this case.

21:59.439 --> 22:02.076
Your brother-in-law just
graduated from Ne'er-do-well

22:02.253 --> 22:06.410
public enemy No1, so no sir, there
will be no plea deal, not for murder one.

22:07.196 --> 22:10.073
Not for Henry Patrick Jenkins
our late district attorney,

22:10.399 --> 22:13.215
and certainly not for
the likes of Jay Chambers,

22:13.331 --> 22:16.625
a man known to throw
bricks at cars from the overpass.

22:17.315 --> 22:18.473
Y'all have an overpass?

22:30.481 --> 22:32.708
Oh, hey I'm gonna need that.
I'm gonna have to take notes.

22:33.451 --> 22:35.874
I know he's a murder suspect, but
he's not gonna doodle me to death.

22:36.187 --> 22:37.744
Sorry, judge's orders.

22:43.428 --> 22:47.609
Jay. - Well, I see my sister still gets you
to do pretty much whatever she wants.

22:51.102 --> 22:52.728
So you here to
save the day?

22:55.406 --> 22:57.193
How about we
start saving your life?

22:57.234 --> 22:58.091
MURDERED D.A.'S
SUSPECT ARRAIGNED

23:04.282 --> 23:07.194
You always were the least
favorite of Pru's husbands.

23:07.585 --> 23:10.360
Well, considering she only had
one, I'll take that as a compliment.

23:14.713 --> 23:16.993
So what's the deal, Jay?
- I don't know.

23:17.495 --> 23:20.500
I mean, I killed somebody.
- Yeah, that's what I've heard.

23:21.021 --> 23:23.646
I also heard that somebody
crept into the courthouse

23:23.681 --> 23:25.192
wearing a mask
and killed the D.A..

23:25.570 --> 23:27.135
Henry Patrick Jenkins.

23:27.170 --> 23:29.693
That they've confirmed
your fingerprints on the gun,

23:29.728 --> 23:31.137
and your boot
prints on the floor.

23:31.643 --> 23:34.860
But, the thing that really made
the executioner smile extra wide

23:35.460 --> 23:37.771
is the fact that they nabbed
you fleeing the scene of the crime

23:38.050 --> 23:40.775
with all the aforementioned
on your person. - What?

23:42.117 --> 23:43.796
What... what do
you want from me?

23:44.188 --> 23:45.838
How about you
start by elaborating.

24:00.271 --> 24:01.589
Nah, I can't.

24:07.946 --> 24:09.380
Jay, what are you doing?

24:15.119 --> 24:17.443
I remember you used
to like puzzles, right?

24:19.157 --> 24:21.265
Read this paper. There's
a good one in there for ya.

24:48.653 --> 24:52.023
All rise! The honorable
judge Thorne presiding.

24:58.279 --> 25:01.200
The state of Georgia
versus Steven Jay Chambers.

25:01.666 --> 25:04.933
Counselor... your
client's been charged with...

25:05.303 --> 25:07.750
first degree murder.
How do you plead?

25:08.606 --> 25:10.588
Guilty.
- Not guilty, Your honor.

25:11.042 --> 25:12.961
Shh.
- What are you doing?

25:13.850 --> 25:16.126
You are not gonna have a leg
to stand on if you plead that.

25:16.415 --> 25:19.883
Excuse me counselor, do we need to
take a recess while you and your client

25:19.918 --> 25:23.371
Discuss how he'd like to plead?
- No, Your honor. Not guilty.

25:24.555 --> 25:26.849
Your honor, I'd also like to
motion for a change of venue.

25:27.440 --> 25:29.449
On what grounds?
- Several, Your honor.

25:29.794 --> 25:30.951
Such as?

25:31.725 --> 25:33.446
Well, I'd rather not have
the jury sitting in the shadow

25:33.564 --> 25:34.934
of the crime scene,
Your honor.

25:35.995 --> 25:37.706
The crime scene is what it is,

25:37.741 --> 25:41.489
whether your client committed
the murder or not. Mr... uh.

25:42.440 --> 25:45.580
McKay, Your honor. - Mr. McKay,
there's been more blood shed

25:45.615 --> 25:50.413
within the shadow of that
jury box... than you'd care to know.

25:50.715 --> 25:55.211
This building... stood
between Sherman and the sea.

25:55.707 --> 26:00.578
There was the assassination of
judge Caliber in '63. The riots of '74.

26:00.872 --> 26:03.427
If I keel over
dead right now...

26:03.694 --> 26:07.579
I expect court to be in session
after lunch. - Yes, Your honor.

26:08.366 --> 26:09.777
I... I just...

26:11.239 --> 26:13.359
I'm not sure that my
client can get a fair trial

26:13.625 --> 26:17.997
of his peers in this community
based on his... past indiscretions.

26:18.076 --> 26:20.974
I feel that a local jury
would have a difficult time

26:21.145 --> 26:23.660
looking past their own
prejudice and preconceptions of

26:23.695 --> 26:25.660
who mr. Chambers was.

26:26.207 --> 26:29.575
Mr. McKay, this county
is made up of hard-working,

26:30.321 --> 26:33.224
God-fearing,
honorable men and women.

26:33.224 --> 26:37.035
I have no doubt that you'll be
able to find a fair and impartial jury.

26:37.604 --> 26:40.779
I understand that, but I'd prefer
an outside jury pool, Your honor.

26:43.612 --> 26:45.940
Since you have the
opportunity to pick your jury

26:46.270 --> 26:49.377
you can strike anyone
you'd deem unfit.

26:49.540 --> 26:55.296
The news of a murdered district attorney
travels far and wide across county lines.

26:55.331 --> 26:58.042
I'm not about to ship
that off to another county.

26:58.316 --> 27:01.946
Not without evidence
that he can't get a fair trial.

27:05.256 --> 27:06.447
Motion denied.

27:07.291 --> 27:08.711
Yes, Your honor.

27:09.260 --> 27:11.850
We'll set the trial for...

27:13.331 --> 27:14.662
november 10th.

27:15.733 --> 27:19.570
November 10th, Your honor?
- Everyone has a right to a speedy trial.

27:19.570 --> 27:21.911
That's how they do
it here. - Yes, Your honor.

27:23.674 --> 27:25.023
Court is adjourned.

27:30.015 --> 27:33.367
So 30 years ago, Prudence
Chambers moves to Nashville.

27:34.485 --> 27:38.320
And whether it's big city
inexperience or just ignorance,

27:38.734 --> 27:41.019
You and I both know if you
wind up in the wrong part of town

27:41.333 --> 27:43.589
at the wrong time of day,
somebody's gonna want your pocketbook.

27:43.895 --> 27:46.349
You take it black, right?
- Mm-Hmm. - But fortunately...

27:47.579 --> 27:50.307
she was rescued by
a brash, young lawyer

27:50.342 --> 27:53.309
who took down her
assailant using only his briefcase.

27:53.538 --> 27:55.390
A briefcase?
- Mmm.

27:56.779 --> 27:59.819
Like my grand-Pappy used to say,
"You don't pick a fight with a lawyer."

28:00.323 --> 28:02.383
Her assailant got
15 years in prison,

28:03.281 --> 28:04.856
and Casey got a date.

28:04.891 --> 28:07.092
And then, he
got a future wife.

28:07.418 --> 28:08.574
Huh.

28:09.921 --> 28:14.192
Wath's all of this? - Well, now even
though he's a natural-born astros fan,

28:14.192 --> 28:17.427
Casey McKay comes from
three generations of Texas rangers.

28:17.728 --> 28:19.778
Instead of becoming a
lawman, he became a lawyer,

28:20.448 --> 28:23.536
moved to Nashville,
won a couple of big cases

28:23.863 --> 28:25.798
and then he put
together a little streak.

28:26.804 --> 28:30.348
But then, he and Pru got
divorced and she moved back home.

28:30.908 --> 28:34.052
I guess that's what you
call career collateral damage.

28:36.914 --> 28:38.227
Well...

28:39.181 --> 28:40.590
you told me what
I need to know.

28:41.652 --> 28:43.569
Hmm.
Thank you.

28:44.288 --> 28:45.328
And what is that?

28:45.363 --> 28:48.230
That this will be a long,
drawn-out trial that'll drag

28:48.265 --> 28:50.852
This county behind it
like cans on a wedding car.

28:51.295 --> 28:52.420
Hmm.

28:53.429 --> 28:56.285
Well, maybe it needs to be
shaken up a little bit around here.

28:57.116 --> 28:58.653
I'm gettin' bored.

29:11.649 --> 29:12.691
Hey!
- Hey.

29:13.985 --> 29:15.953
So...

29:15.953 --> 29:17.101
no plea?

29:18.856 --> 29:21.725
From what I can gather we're lucky
Jay's not already swinging from a tree.

29:22.028 --> 29:24.395
So, yeah, no plea.
- So what's the plan?

29:24.762 --> 29:27.537
I don't know et Your brother's
holding it pretty close to the chest.

29:27.999 --> 29:29.273
But, he's hiding something.

29:30.743 --> 29:32.022
Or maybe he's
protecting someone.

29:33.871 --> 29:36.747
What do you mean?
- Maybe he's... protecting Kit.

29:37.875 --> 29:39.814
I mean, no one's seen
him since the shooting.

29:40.711 --> 29:42.023
Hmm.

29:43.547 --> 29:46.364
Say, do the words "Go to
Forbs" mean anything to you?

29:46.817 --> 29:49.942
Hmm? - Yeah, it's the
best I can do right now.

30:01.732 --> 30:02.756
Boots...

30:05.635 --> 30:08.314
Frog. - What? - Boots and
Frog are two of his buddies.

30:08.706 --> 30:11.202
What? Now how'd you do that?

30:11.609 --> 30:14.584
Jay and I used to...
play word scrambles as kids.

30:14.745 --> 30:17.037
But Boots and Frogs were
suposed to pick him up from prison.

30:18.700 --> 30:20.420
But then you've
got to find a...

30:22.103 --> 30:24.517
then you've got
to find my nephew.

30:26.596 --> 30:28.245
Yeah, what I need
is an investigator

30:28.860 --> 30:30.452
A good one;
one that I can trust.

30:31.549 --> 30:32.910
Any suggestions in this town?

30:34.075 --> 30:35.140
Yeah, I know someone.

32:03.120 --> 32:04.697
Boss wants to see you.

32:12.696 --> 32:13.863
Oh, okay.

32:14.698 --> 32:17.255
So I don't get to
have my toys, huh?

32:21.672 --> 32:24.688
Mr. Ex.
- Gates!

32:25.256 --> 32:27.079
Sorry about the
rather noisy intrusion.

32:27.912 --> 32:30.800
Hopefully I didn't disturb
too many of your guests.

32:31.081 --> 32:34.053
No, no. Nice car,
though. - Yeah.

32:35.553 --> 32:39.236
How is this hospitality
business working out for ya?

32:39.924 --> 32:41.796
Well, it's a little
slow these days.

32:42.760 --> 32:45.395
But as long as it keeps your
knickers in a knot, I'm happy.

32:47.798 --> 32:49.389
That's hurtin' my feelings.

32:51.068 --> 32:57.321
And it's gonna
hurt me even more

32:57.241 --> 32:58.923
That you're in a lot
of pain. - Whoa, now!

32:58.958 --> 33:03.499
Ooh! - Whoa, whoa. - Oh sorry,
sorry. It's just a reflex. - Oh!

33:04.715 --> 33:07.919
See... you bring this on yourself.

33:08.352 --> 33:11.431
Yeah, my first sergeant
told me I was a glutton for pain.

33:12.089 --> 33:15.022
Or maybe that was my
second wife. I get them mixed up.

33:15.893 --> 33:19.277
Well you must think
you're a clever man

33:19.797 --> 33:22.211
buying this little
cockroach motel.

33:22.900 --> 33:25.665
Well, yes. - The thing is, you
forgot to get the parking lot.

33:26.241 --> 33:28.128
Oh, I'm sorry,
did you need this plot?

33:30.254 --> 33:33.351
That dog track's going
ahead. It's inevitable.

33:33.968 --> 33:36.483
I don't know. By the time
I get done with you,

33:36.779 --> 33:40.012
I don't think you're gonna be able
to run for librarian, much less mayor.

33:41.719 --> 33:42.660
You see...

33:44.355 --> 33:46.444
you do this to yourself.

33:46.850 --> 33:49.386
Yeah, it was definitely
my second wife that said that.

33:51.962 --> 33:52.978
Have at it.

33:53.864 --> 33:55.786
Oh no, here comes Gilligan.

33:56.333 --> 33:58.006
Need a stool there, little
buddy? Can you reach me?

34:03.107 --> 34:05.497
Gah!
That didn't hurt.

34:06.642 --> 34:09.793
You go ahead and finish that off.
- I've got a long memory, lurch.

34:10.848 --> 34:11.697
Better make it good.

34:14.318 --> 34:17.001
Ah, yeah.

34:46.150 --> 34:47.951
Hey, perfect timing!

34:47.951 --> 34:50.920
Would you come over
here and hand me a flathead?

34:53.724 --> 34:55.324
Right up there on top.

34:57.094 --> 35:00.464
Any time, sweetheart.
- There you go.

35:00.464 --> 35:03.300
Yeah, so I'm uh,
looking for a room.

35:03.300 --> 35:06.203
Okay, just give
me a second.

35:09.973 --> 35:11.141
Thank you.

35:15.479 --> 35:17.813
There we go.
All right.

35:23.954 --> 35:26.757
There you go.
- Thank you.

35:28.058 --> 35:31.328
You okay?
- Oh, yeah.

35:32.262 --> 35:34.832
I cut myself shaving.

35:34.832 --> 35:36.934
Name's Ex.

35:36.934 --> 35:40.871
Ah...
- Oh. - Yeah.

35:40.871 --> 35:43.539
So is that "x," like the one letter?
- No, two letters, you know.

35:43.900 --> 35:48.865
Like ex-cop, ex-marine,
ex-bounty hunter, Ex-boxer,

35:48.900 --> 35:51.319
ex-husband.
You get the idea.

35:52.981 --> 35:55.566
Well, the name's Casey
McKay. - That's the rumor.

35:56.987 --> 35:58.633
I'll just run
your card. - Sure.

36:00.758 --> 36:03.160
Business is booming, huh?

36:03.160 --> 36:05.295
Oh, well let's just say

36:05.295 --> 36:07.568
you're gonna get
the Eisenhower suite.

36:08.065 --> 36:11.301
Now, when I bought this
place, it didn't come with a maid.

36:11.902 --> 36:13.948
So, you're gonna have
to do your own bedding.

36:14.071 --> 36:15.573
Sheets and towels
are in the closet.

36:16.588 --> 36:19.601
Breakfast down here at
seven a.m. every morning. And...

36:20.441 --> 36:21.311
that's how is it.

36:21.646 --> 36:23.828
I mean, if you need any of
those little shampoos or something,

36:23.863 --> 36:25.563
I'm sure there's a box
around here somewhere.

36:25.820 --> 36:27.283
Look, pardon me
for saying so, but...

36:28.260 --> 36:30.180
inn keeper just doesn't
have quite the same bravado

36:30.546 --> 36:32.121
as some of your
past vocations had.

36:33.090 --> 36:36.391
Well, there's a snake trying
to build a dog track around here,

36:36.426 --> 36:38.575
and he wants
this land. - Yeah?

36:39.563 --> 36:41.303
You ever been to a dog track?

36:41.899 --> 36:43.519
No, I can't say that I have.

36:43.896 --> 36:45.933
Ever seen what
gambling can do to people?

36:47.271 --> 36:49.708
Well... well, it killed my mom.

36:50.833 --> 36:53.957
I saw black jack siphon off
everything that we owned.

36:54.545 --> 36:56.572
Gambling's a disease.

36:57.114 --> 36:59.332
I don't want that
to kill this town.

37:01.485 --> 37:02.214
So...

37:02.909 --> 37:05.181
And on that note, I
hope you enjoy your stay.

37:05.489 --> 37:07.846
I'll point you in the right
direction. - And by the way...

37:09.060 --> 37:12.879
I hear that you're a P.I.
- Well, that license is expired, too.

37:13.063 --> 37:15.031
I'm an ex-P.I.
What are you looking for?

37:15.484 --> 37:18.268
Well, I'm just looking for a couple
guys go by the name Boots and Frog.

37:19.136 --> 37:22.175
Just the who, what and the where?
- Ah, just the where for now.

37:24.842 --> 37:26.410
I tell ya what, I'll look into it

37:26.410 --> 37:29.213
and then I'll just charge it
to your room. - Fair enough.

37:30.013 --> 37:31.007
Let me show
you the way.

37:51.134 --> 37:55.239
Well, if this is the Eisenhower
suite, I'd hate to see the Taft.

38:21.465 --> 38:23.567
Quite the fortified
set-up you got there.

38:23.567 --> 38:25.469
What you want?

38:25.469 --> 38:27.938
Well, I read your
statement in the police report.

38:27.938 --> 38:30.107
And well, I was just
wondering if you might

38:30.107 --> 38:32.576
Have any further
thoughts on the Chambers' case.

38:32.576 --> 38:35.012
He deserves to fry.

39:05.375 --> 39:07.110
Next stop.

40:15.479 --> 40:16.346
Hello?

40:19.149 --> 40:20.550
Hello?

40:55.819 --> 40:59.222
17 Mississippi...
18 Mississippi...

40:59.222 --> 41:03.060
19 Mississippi...
25 Mississippi...

41:04.795 --> 41:07.798
27 Mississippi...
28 Mississippi...

41:16.640 --> 41:19.023
28 Mississippi's.

41:31.254 --> 41:34.458
How'd it go?
- Fine.

41:34.458 --> 41:36.358
Is ex gonna help you?
- We'll see how it goes.

41:37.439 --> 41:39.429
Can I ask you
something? - Shoot.

41:41.845 --> 41:45.122
Do you think Jay did it?
- It doesn't matter what I think.

41:45.721 --> 41:48.458
Well, it matters to me.
- I think that...

41:48.930 --> 41:50.920
everybody deserves a
vigorous defense and a fair trial.

41:51.190 --> 41:52.366
And I'll do my
best to give him that.

41:54.177 --> 41:55.860
Thank you.
- For what?

41:56.547 --> 41:57.941
For doing this.

41:58.783 --> 42:01.684
Why don't you repay me by
letting me take you to dinner?

42:03.054 --> 42:05.245
Don't you go try winning
me back, Casey McKay.

42:05.623 --> 42:07.517
You don't remember
why you lost me.

42:08.059 --> 42:09.526
I'd settle for a lunch.

42:09.827 --> 42:13.262
Ah, we'll see.
Later case.

42:13.564 --> 42:14.615
Later gator.

42:35.052 --> 42:37.134
Hey there, big city.

42:38.622 --> 42:41.910
You think you can just...
roll up here with them

42:42.026 --> 42:44.662
fancy car and them boots

42:44.662 --> 42:47.087
and convince a guilty
man to plead not guilty?

42:48.065 --> 42:50.701
Actually it's called a trial.

42:50.701 --> 42:53.104
It's something that keeps
troubled boys like yourselves

42:53.104 --> 42:55.506
from getting
flushed down the toilet.

42:56.640 --> 42:58.976
Chambers, is guilty as sin.

42:58.976 --> 43:02.146
And you know it.

43:02.146 --> 43:04.582
So you just let him roll
over and be done with it.

43:04.582 --> 43:07.418
You hear?

43:07.418 --> 43:11.389
I'm gonna give you sin if you
don't take your hands off my suit.

43:13.758 --> 43:14.892
Just...

43:17.995 --> 43:20.598
Get him to change
the plea, all right?

43:21.999 --> 43:24.435
You've backed me into
a corner here, fellas

43:24.435 --> 43:26.971
with no avenue for escape.

43:26.971 --> 43:30.441
So unless you step off,
you're gonna be forcin' me to fight.

43:32.810 --> 43:35.413
Forcing you to fight, old man?

43:36.747 --> 43:40.017
I'm beggin' ya.
Huh?

43:40.017 --> 43:41.652
All right.

43:44.922 --> 43:47.057
Y'all better start
digging up mason jars,

43:47.057 --> 43:49.093
because when I'm finished
dragging you across the law

43:49.093 --> 43:52.778
you'll be so broke with fines...
- You won't be able to pay attention.

44:00.871 --> 44:02.706
My granddaddy took
on a gang of outlaws with

44:02.706 --> 44:05.311
nothing but a pair of
spurs and a buffalo bone.

44:05.676 --> 44:07.928
I reckon I can
handle the lot of you.

44:32.570 --> 44:35.367
What do you think?
Call an ambulance?

44:35.773 --> 44:37.974
Ah, you broke my nose.
- I don't know, I'm good.

44:38.142 --> 44:40.078
You good?
- Yeah, I'm good.

44:40.644 --> 44:42.116
Maybe we should call the cops.

44:42.813 --> 44:45.930
Nah... no, I think
justice was served today.

44:50.054 --> 44:51.689
Ow.

44:54.859 --> 44:56.260
So who were
those knuckleheads?

44:57.194 --> 44:59.630
Mr. Gates' men.

44:59.630 --> 45:04.268
One of those han-Yonkers
dropped this.

45:04.268 --> 45:06.704
Hmm.
J.C.?

45:06.704 --> 45:09.565
Jay Chambers. I gave one
to each of my groomsmen.

45:11.163 --> 45:13.090
Jay Chambers was
one of your groomsmen?

45:13.210 --> 45:15.906
Well, for the rehearsal.
Never made the wedding.

45:16.514 --> 45:19.817
You know Jay? - I know he
used to be one of Gates' men.

45:21.752 --> 45:24.264
You and I might be fighting
different battles in the same war.

45:31.562 --> 45:34.353
I've never been good at
fightin' with words and paper.

45:35.165 --> 45:37.962
I drown in all that
legalese mumbo-jumbo.

45:37.968 --> 45:40.328
And I don't know a
loophole from a lily pad.

45:40.604 --> 45:44.554
But I will be your P.I.
pro bono if you'll help

45:44.589 --> 45:47.024
me fight this dog track.
- I thought your license expired.

45:47.278 --> 45:49.585
Yeah, and so did
my boxing license.

45:49.620 --> 45:51.191
I didn't hear you
complain about that.

45:51.916 --> 45:52.974
Got yourself a deal.

45:55.753 --> 45:58.373
It comes with the room.
- Looks like it.

46:05.095 --> 46:08.098
Yeah, I know of Jay Chambers.

46:08.098 --> 46:12.268
I was there when he
caught mr. Miller's field on fire.

46:13.804 --> 46:17.541
Your honor, I request this
juror be removed on basis of cause.

46:17.908 --> 46:20.173
Agreed, you may step down.

46:20.844 --> 46:22.580
Well, I didn't know Jay directly.

46:22.580 --> 46:24.703
But, my sister was
his sunday school teacher.

46:24.982 --> 46:27.517
And she said he was
the meanest child in church.

46:27.885 --> 46:31.508
One christmas, he
put ex-lax in the punch.

46:31.922 --> 46:34.508
It was this
egg-nog looking stuff.

46:34.725 --> 46:36.842
'Course there
was no alcohol in it.

46:36.877 --> 46:38.960
This the devil's juice.

46:39.063 --> 46:40.999
Ex-lax doesn't
sound any better.

46:42.333 --> 46:44.988
Your honor...
I move to strike.

46:45.836 --> 46:49.223
Ma'am, you are excused.
- Well, one time he...

46:49.239 --> 46:50.415
Move to strike.

46:52.009 --> 46:54.434
Can you believe he knocked out
the groom right at the ceremony?

46:54.469 --> 46:55.481
Your honor...

46:55.980 --> 47:00.150
Presented with the evidence, you
could come to a fair verdict? - I do.

47:00.150 --> 47:05.201
Even if the punishment was death?
- I believe we reap what we sow.

47:05.756 --> 47:07.427
That's what my
mama taught me.

47:08.355 --> 47:10.187
Your honor, I'm good
with this juror. - Your honor...

47:11.128 --> 47:12.284
I object.

47:13.764 --> 47:16.250
Will counsel please
approach the bench?

47:21.372 --> 47:27.706
Counselor, you can't excuse
all of the available jurors.

47:35.719 --> 47:37.762
Fine, I'll allow him.

47:38.822 --> 47:39.739
Thank you.

47:40.958 --> 47:43.179
Great, we have
our first juror.

47:43.214 --> 47:47.546
Bailiff, would you bring in the
next batch of potential jurors?

47:47.898 --> 47:50.994
All rise for the next
batch of potential jurors.

48:02.146 --> 48:03.881
Come in.

48:03.881 --> 48:06.850
Hey!
- Hey.

48:06.850 --> 48:11.255
Oh, i remember when you
used to do this to my dining room.

48:11.255 --> 48:13.314
That room always had
the best light. - Hmmm.

48:13.891 --> 48:16.827
Hey boss, we're
in business... Pru!

48:16.827 --> 48:19.063
Hey, Solomon.
- How are ya?

48:19.063 --> 48:22.399
Good, how are you? - Pretty
good considering my advanced age.

48:22.399 --> 48:23.652
Y'all are friends?

48:23.734 --> 48:26.850
Oh yeah we uh...
we go way back.

48:26.885 --> 48:27.971
What?
You didn't tell him?

48:28.972 --> 48:30.467
Pru and I used to date.

48:31.008 --> 48:33.450
Ha, ha!
Date? Ha, ha!

48:34.144 --> 48:37.723
What? - You need
somethin'? - No, but you do.

48:38.082 --> 48:40.732
This is Jason "Frog" Stittum.

48:41.018 --> 48:44.855
He's got a mother in a nursing
home. She hasn't seen him in a week,

48:44.855 --> 48:46.603
And he usually comes
by every saturday.

48:47.958 --> 48:50.420
And this is Michael "Boots" Killby.

48:50.828 --> 48:53.284
He's got a very scared,
angry, and desperate wife.

48:53.319 --> 48:56.026
She hasn't seen
him since Jay got out.

48:56.266 --> 48:59.290
Apparently, she overheard a
conversation where they were

48:59.325 --> 49:02.172
planning to meet at a barn
near the bootlegger path

49:02.172 --> 49:04.908
which would be right here.
- Gates owns most of that land.

49:04.908 --> 49:06.488
Any idea what that
meeting was about?

49:06.523 --> 49:08.730
I'd say the three of
them were there to cut bait.

49:08.779 --> 49:10.214
Kit must have
been at that barn too,

49:10.214 --> 49:11.837
because he went with
him to go pick up Jay.

49:13.083 --> 49:15.739
If Jay got that boy in
trouble, he'd be lucky to fry.

49:16.253 --> 49:20.290
We're gonna need to
check that out. - Yeah, we are.

49:20.290 --> 49:23.139
Pru, could we uh... could
we change lunch to dinner?

49:23.927 --> 49:26.216
Hmmm... I'm booked.
- Tomorrow?

49:26.251 --> 49:28.639
Ummm... thursday?

49:28.866 --> 49:30.134
That's perfect.
- Okay.

49:30.134 --> 49:33.003
You're welcome to join us, Ex.

49:33.003 --> 49:35.345
Hey, that sounds fun.
I wouldn't miss it.

49:38.342 --> 49:40.346
You know you're not
comin' to dinner, right?

49:48.085 --> 49:49.853
It might look pretty,
but the backwoods of

49:49.853 --> 49:52.256
Cherokee Hills is what
produced all of Gates' men.

49:52.256 --> 49:55.959
Hmph... and you?
- I'm too pretty to be from the

49:55.959 --> 49:57.861
Backwoods of Cherokee Hills!

50:13.043 --> 50:15.045
Was this really that necessary?

50:15.045 --> 50:17.926
Nah, we could have just
taken your flashy sports car;

50:18.048 --> 50:20.526
parked it in front of
a potential crime scene

50:20.561 --> 50:23.774
owned by a potential murderer,
and then just see what happened.

50:28.292 --> 50:30.518
So you still got a
thing for Pru, huh?

50:30.561 --> 50:34.279
She was my wife.
- So what? I've had 3 of 'em.

50:34.331 --> 50:36.720
I'm not trying to get any of 'em back!
- Yeah, but they weren't Pru.

50:36.834 --> 50:38.127
That's true.

50:38.202 --> 50:40.997
It's been 10 years, man.
Why do you care now?

50:41.138 --> 50:43.318
I always cared, I just didn't
know what to do about it.

50:45.242 --> 50:47.357
So what do you
make of all this, Ex?

50:48.045 --> 50:48.988
Well...

50:50.948 --> 50:54.852
People don't just
vanish in my experience;

50:54.852 --> 50:59.377
somebody makes 'em
disappear. -  So... - Hmmm.

51:02.459 --> 51:03.849
Bullet hole.

51:06.630 --> 51:08.546
That's a .45.

51:09.499 --> 51:12.011
Yes, it is. That's
a 9 mm there,

51:12.202 --> 51:15.211
and then take a look
at this... different angle.

51:15.472 --> 51:17.207
That leads me to think
that this there is uh...

51:17.207 --> 51:19.177
This is what happened
to Boots and Frog.

51:19.212 --> 51:21.473
I just hope Kit wasn't
here when this went down.

51:24.381 --> 51:28.273
I'm not ex-forensics but I'd be
willing to bet that pinball machine

51:28.308 --> 51:29.858
that we're gonna
find seven shooters

51:30.187 --> 51:32.001
because Gates
usually runs in sevens.

51:32.289 --> 51:34.432
I don't know, the most
I can figure here is six.

51:37.628 --> 51:40.016
You know, there's no
bullet holes on this wall so...

51:40.998 --> 51:43.232
Maybe Boots, Frog,
and Kit got ambushed?

51:44.268 --> 51:48.326
If I was gonna do an
ambush, might do it righere, see?

51:55.112 --> 51:58.102
Six shooters...
seven members of the gang...

51:59.516 --> 52:01.039
Seven members of the gang.

52:02.452 --> 52:04.919
These guys are good.
I don't see blood anywhere.

52:05.389 --> 52:08.312
You know, my daddy used to take
me hunting a lot when I was a kid.

52:08.358 --> 52:10.791
He put a lot of emphasis
on me tagging my first deer.

52:11.461 --> 52:14.206
And then one day I found
myself aiming at an 8-point buck.

52:14.598 --> 52:19.182
So I raised my gun and I
had that deer in my sights.

52:20.237 --> 52:21.334
But...

52:22.439 --> 52:25.238
I just couldn't
do it, so I shot high.

52:26.443 --> 52:27.979
You couldn't shoot a deer?

52:28.445 --> 52:30.122
What a wimp!

52:30.948 --> 52:35.082
No, not a wimp...
I was just scared.

52:38.188 --> 52:42.391
We need to find what is. - There's
gotta be some kind of link between

52:42.426 --> 52:46.096
What happened here, and
the murder of that D.A. - Um-Hmm.

52:53.236 --> 52:55.592
Sit it right by
there, by the windows.

53:02.279 --> 53:04.213
Sorry, come on.

53:27.137 --> 53:30.510
Parking closer to the barn doesn't
seem like such a bad idea now does it?

53:30.545 --> 53:31.749
Come on.

53:39.583 --> 53:43.420
Dusty, why didn't
you hear that gunshot?

53:43.420 --> 53:45.455
Um, the train.

53:46.757 --> 53:50.660
I mean, everyone knows how loud it gets;
the clanging and banging like a gunshot

53:50.660 --> 53:52.329
every couple of cars or so...

54:23.093 --> 54:25.328
Freeze! - Gun!
Get on the ground!

54:25.328 --> 54:27.264
Get on the ground!
- Get on the ground now!

54:27.264 --> 54:29.699
Get down on the ground!
- Get on the ground!

54:29.699 --> 54:32.169
Get down!
Drop the weapon!

54:32.169 --> 54:34.071
I'm dropping my gun now.
- Drop the weapon!

54:34.071 --> 54:37.240
Get down! Get
down! Get down!

54:40.444 --> 54:43.513
So you saw who

54:43.513 --> 54:45.549
Standing over the body,

54:46.283 --> 54:47.717
of mr. Jenkins?

54:51.121 --> 54:53.323
That fella over there.

54:53.323 --> 54:56.493
Let the record show that
the witness has identified

54:56.493 --> 54:59.596
The defendant, Jay Chambers.

54:59.596 --> 55:01.264
Thank you, Dusty.

55:01.264 --> 55:04.668
No more questions, Your honor.

55:04.668 --> 55:08.205
Your witness, mr. McKay.
- Thank you, Your honor.

55:11.741 --> 55:13.543
So...

55:13.543 --> 55:16.246
Dusty, you uh...
you like music?

55:20.117 --> 55:23.487
Um...
Yes sir, I love music.

55:23.487 --> 55:26.256
Yeah, what kind of music?

55:26.256 --> 55:30.460
Um... really
anything that moves.

55:30.460 --> 55:32.896
Right, right. A lot of drums,
cymbals... stuff like that?

55:32.896 --> 55:34.831
Yes, oh absolutely.
Yes, sir. Uh...

55:34.831 --> 55:38.502
Anything that moves like I said.
- In fact, you were listening to

55:38.502 --> 55:41.777
Music the night of the murder,
weren't you? - Oh yes, sir. Yes, sir.

55:41.812 --> 55:43.034
I mean, I listen...

55:44.474 --> 55:47.888
I mean, I listen to music
every night so... - Nice and loud?

55:47.923 --> 55:49.056
Oh, um...

55:49.546 --> 55:51.715
probably a little louder
than my doctor would like.

55:52.716 --> 55:55.624
Too loud to hear
a gunshot? - Huh?

55:55.659 --> 55:59.359
Well, isn't it possible
or even likely that uh...

55:59.394 --> 56:02.237
D.A. Jenkins was shot
far earlier than you say?

56:02.272 --> 56:05.738
Objection, Your honor.
He's asking the witness to speculate.

56:06.396 --> 56:09.347
Overruled. Continue.

56:09.382 --> 56:12.170
Well, before my client
even entered the building...

56:12.205 --> 56:14.329
and long before the train
rolled through town...

56:14.771 --> 56:17.401
is it possible you
didn't hear the gunshot?

56:18.909 --> 56:21.905
I'm sure I would've
heard gunshot.

56:22.612 --> 56:24.262
Ahem.

56:25.515 --> 56:28.295
May I uh... approach
the witness, Your honor?

56:28.330 --> 56:29.592
Proceed.

56:30.287 --> 56:34.784
Now Dusty, can you
identify this as your headset?

56:34.819 --> 56:36.495
Yes sir, it was my father's.

56:37.576 --> 56:38.828
What I'd like you to do is put
the headset on and adjust the

56:38.828 --> 56:43.225
Volume to that level your
doctor says is too loud.

56:43.260 --> 56:44.359
Okay.
- Okay.

56:44.394 --> 56:46.744
And then I want you to
close your eyes and press play,

56:46.779 --> 56:50.471
and raise your hand when
you hear this book hit the floor.

56:50.506 --> 56:52.680
Yes, sir.
- Proceed.

56:52.715 --> 56:56.024
# Close your eyes

56:56.059 --> 57:00.984
# let your troubles slip away

57:00.984 --> 57:03.416
# just imagine

57:09.492 --> 57:11.761
Ahem...

57:13.597 --> 57:15.794
No further questions, Your honor.

57:17.400 --> 57:18.724
Thank you, Dusty.

57:37.988 --> 57:40.450
So how do we find
this seventh shooter?

57:43.892 --> 57:45.923
It's him.
- Ratchet?

57:46.595 --> 57:48.241
Um-hmm. Nervous as always.

57:48.764 --> 57:52.439
He's the one; he's
the one who aimed high.

57:53.636 --> 57:54.621
It takes one to know one.

57:56.805 --> 57:59.340
So what was your last
memory of that evening?

58:00.743 --> 58:02.717
I saw Jay Chambers running

58:03.512 --> 58:05.708
out of the building
with a gun in his hand.

58:06.415 --> 58:08.924
Now, it's my understanding that you've
been robbed twice in the past four months...

58:09.351 --> 58:10.355
Objection, Your honor.

58:10.552 --> 58:12.868
Unless the defense
wants to add larceny

58:13.389 --> 58:15.428
to his client's charges,
how is this relevant?

58:18.460 --> 58:20.963
Your honor, if I may have
just a little bit of leeway?

58:20.963 --> 58:21.906
I'll get to the point.

58:23.465 --> 58:25.260
Very well, make it quick.

58:25.734 --> 58:27.292
Now you've been
robbed twice, is that correct?

58:27.603 --> 58:31.769
That's right. Twice.  - And you were able
to call 911 during both of those robberies?

58:32.041 --> 58:33.968
Yes.
- Objection, Your honor.

58:35.344 --> 58:37.582
Mr. McKay...
- Yes, Your honor.

58:38.013 --> 58:41.023
My question is, how long did it take the
police to arrive after you made those calls?

58:41.950 --> 58:43.980
It felt like a
lifetime... forever.

58:44.987 --> 58:45.964
Ten minutes maybe.

58:46.789 --> 58:49.026
Hmm... now let
me get this straight.

58:50.066 --> 58:53.355
It took ten minutes for the
police to arrive for your two break-ins,

58:53.763 --> 58:55.564
but those four squad cars

58:55.564 --> 58:58.983
made it to the courthouse in under
28 seconds after the D.A. was murdered.

59:00.035 --> 59:02.438
28 seconds...
give or take a Mississippi.

59:02.972 --> 59:04.028
Now how do you explain that.

59:06.434 --> 59:09.678
I guess they were called before he was
murdered. - Objection. - Order. - Your honor...

59:09.678 --> 59:12.053
That's conjecture!
- Order in the court!

59:12.715 --> 59:13.966
That's conjecture.

59:14.616 --> 59:17.037
Sustained, please strike
that from the record.

59:17.678 --> 59:19.622
Jury, please ignore
that last statement.

59:20.989 --> 59:24.972
Counsel, save your theories
for your closing argument.

59:25.602 --> 59:26.924
Yes, Your honor.
No further questions.

59:28.664 --> 59:31.316
I'm sorry... one moment,
Your honor? - Keep it brief, counsel.

59:31.633 --> 59:34.803
Yes, Your honor. - Here are
all the pending cases the D.A.

59:34.803 --> 59:36.241
had before his murder.

59:36.872 --> 59:39.480
Guess who may have had a
great big beef with the deceased?

59:40.676 --> 59:42.457
Your good buddy, Archibald Gates?

59:42.711 --> 59:45.242
Um-hmm, and guess whose
case suddenly got shelved?

59:48.016 --> 59:51.050
My man, Ben Wingwright, is
gonna need to reopen that case.

59:51.577 --> 59:52.371
Thanks, Ex.

59:52.955 --> 59:55.834
Counsel McKay, is there something
you wanna share with the court?

59:56.558 --> 59:57.707
My apologies, Your honor.

59:59.495 --> 01:00:00.244
Pull!

01:00:06.733 --> 01:00:07.841
Pull!

01:00:12.941 --> 01:00:14.127
Not bad.

01:00:15.878 --> 01:00:18.975
You wanna shot?
- Nah, I'm good.

01:00:20.927 --> 01:00:22.091
You wanted to
see me? - I did.

01:00:22.519 --> 01:00:25.666
I want to encourage you to reopen
your predecessor's case on mr. Gates.

01:00:25.970 --> 01:00:29.227
Well, all his cases have been
shelved until they find a replacement.

01:00:29.709 --> 01:00:30.891
But you could open them.

01:00:31.593 --> 01:00:34.714
I've got enough on my plate with
your client. - Yeah, I've read the case file.

01:00:35.097 --> 01:00:37.267
You're spending more time
investigating me than Jay Chambers.

01:00:39.101 --> 01:00:40.387
Ex has told me
a lot about you.

01:00:41.537 --> 01:00:43.267
For the past 25 years,
you've paved the way

01:00:43.439 --> 01:00:45.105
for men like
Henry Patrick Jenkins.

01:00:46.002 --> 01:00:47.849
He may have been the pillar,
but you've been the bedrock.

01:00:48.967 --> 01:00:52.007
Why do I want to reopen this case?
- Because i believe mr. Gates

01:00:52.614 --> 01:00:53.872
had something to do
with the D.A.'s murder.

01:00:55.551 --> 01:00:56.430
I doubt it.

01:00:57.119 --> 01:00:59.388
Doubting one's doubts
makes a second chance possible.

01:01:01.723 --> 01:01:06.876
Falsely accusing mr. Gates
is a dangerous game.

01:01:07.829 --> 01:01:09.285
Even for someone
like you.

01:01:18.321 --> 01:01:19.247
Pull.

01:01:28.851 --> 01:01:31.238
Reopen that case on Gates...
and watch what happens.

01:01:51.343 --> 01:01:52.447
Hmm.

01:02:03.185 --> 01:02:06.999
"New chapter, love Pru".

01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:45.711
Can I get you something?

01:02:46.395 --> 01:02:49.509
A pack of peanuts?
A bucket of ice?

01:02:51.949 --> 01:02:54.293
I do really like what
you've done with the place.

01:02:54.703 --> 01:02:57.550
Yeah, it really sets the mood.

01:02:59.742 --> 01:03:01.583
The boss is waitin' for you.

01:03:17.226 --> 01:03:18.647
Turn around slowly.

01:03:19.562 --> 01:03:21.989
Or else my daddy's gun is
gonna blast you to the moon.

01:03:33.976 --> 01:03:36.517
Ex. Hey, we're busy today.

01:03:43.219 --> 01:03:44.494
Mr. Casey.

01:03:45.754 --> 01:03:47.418
Uh... mr. Gates, I presume?

01:03:49.425 --> 01:03:51.592
Well, it seems to me...

01:03:53.662 --> 01:03:55.398
as you're diggin' Jay's grave,

01:03:55.831 --> 01:03:58.140
you're shoveling
some dirt on me.

01:03:58.901 --> 01:04:01.306
Oh, I'm not in the business
of digging graves.

01:04:02.404 --> 01:04:04.387
What are ya in the
business of? - Justice.

01:04:05.241 --> 01:04:10.904
Well, i've got my own justice, mr. McKay.
- Hey, look... look.  Don't sugarcoat it.

01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:13.063
Just threaten me like a
man and then walk away.

01:04:13.682 --> 01:04:15.749
See, I gotta date tonight so...

01:04:17.253 --> 01:04:18.073
Hmph.

01:04:24.660 --> 01:04:26.177
I wasn't threatening you.

01:04:27.396 --> 01:04:30.521
I was just giving you a
friendly warning. - Same difference.

01:04:30.933 --> 01:04:34.177
No, no, no.
You see, a threat...

01:04:35.804 --> 01:04:37.281
would go something like this.

01:04:39.008 --> 01:04:40.701
You try and pin
some dirt on me,

01:04:40.976 --> 01:04:42.731
my boys here will
put you in a grave.

01:04:43.545 --> 01:04:44.972
Now, that's a threat.

01:04:47.883 --> 01:04:50.475
Now a warning would be more like...

01:04:51.820 --> 01:04:55.129
while I support your
search for the truth,

01:04:55.524 --> 01:04:59.099
if you slander my name
in the process, I will sue.

01:05:01.530 --> 01:05:04.355
Well, that's a threat
too isn't it? Yeah... ah...

01:05:07.703 --> 01:05:09.530
Colt single action .45.

01:05:10.439 --> 01:05:13.042
You know, some folks say
that's the gun that Wyatt Earp

01:05:13.042 --> 01:05:15.858
used at the O.K. corral,
but that's not true.

01:05:16.345 --> 01:05:18.154
He actually had a Smith
and Wesson model three.

01:05:18.414 --> 01:05:19.834
G'day? Hmm...

01:05:20.716 --> 01:05:22.146
Yeah, my daddy was a collector.

01:05:22.985 --> 01:05:27.212
I have his colt single
action .44 and his double action .41.

01:05:27.923 --> 01:05:29.918
Wow, did you know this...

01:05:31.393 --> 01:05:33.315
Billy the Kid used to carry them.

01:05:33.562 --> 01:05:35.739
He called one "Thunder" and
the other one was "Lightning."

01:05:35.798 --> 01:05:40.747
That's right, that's right!
You know, I also have my daddy's

01:05:40.782 --> 01:05:41.036
Winchester .73 tucked
away in my closet...

01:05:41.036 --> 01:05:42.764
for the uninvited so-to-speak.

01:05:45.941 --> 01:05:50.018
Wow... it's very rare
to meet another aficionado.

01:05:50.112 --> 01:05:53.287
Oh, you would have loved my daddy.
And he would have loved this town.

01:05:53.716 --> 01:05:55.911
All y'all acting like
it's the Wild west.

01:05:56.485 --> 01:05:58.085
Between you and Ex, I'm just...

01:05:58.554 --> 01:06:00.605
I'm just surprised you
don't settle this at High noon.

01:06:05.994 --> 01:06:07.260
It's not a bad idea.

01:06:08.063 --> 01:06:09.250
What do you think, Solomon?

01:06:10.466 --> 01:06:12.698
You and me, High noon,
the middle of the street.

01:06:12.935 --> 01:06:15.551
We'll shoot it out for this
little rat-motel of yours?

01:06:16.872 --> 01:06:20.135
If it's just you and me...
any time, any place.

01:06:24.446 --> 01:06:25.797
You see, Solomon there...

01:06:27.383 --> 01:06:28.982
he's your side of the coin.

01:06:29.685 --> 01:06:31.252
Me? I was born dirt poor.

01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:36.468
But Ex's mama was
very good at making money.

01:06:37.726 --> 01:06:39.429
See, everything I have...

01:06:40.162 --> 01:06:41.613
I went to the dog track...

01:06:42.431 --> 01:06:44.873
See, I gambled
everything; went all-in.

01:06:46.068 --> 01:06:48.359
Made me the man I am today.

01:06:49.938 --> 01:06:55.200
So the opportunities around
here to make it rich are very slim.

01:06:55.878 --> 01:06:58.568
So Ii just want to give
people a chance of success

01:06:58.603 --> 01:07:01.279
like I had... you understand?

01:07:02.117 --> 01:07:05.713
You know, you don't
strike me as a gambling man.

01:07:06.088 --> 01:07:09.200
Actually, I think you're the kinda guy
that likes to stack the deck in his favor.

01:07:09.725 --> 01:07:10.899
Now I'm willing to bet

01:07:11.915 --> 01:07:14.300
that you had something
to do with D.A. Jenkins' death.

01:07:14.797 --> 01:07:17.184
And so I'm gonna stick
around 'til you're behind bars.

01:07:18.767 --> 01:07:20.081
Now that's a threat.

01:07:22.805 --> 01:07:23.983
It was.

01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:28.453
And so is this... your pet
snake over there, Geraldo...

01:07:28.877 --> 01:07:31.029
If he doesn't give
me my watch back,

01:07:31.064 --> 01:07:32.828
I'm gonna throw him head
first through that pinball machine.

01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:40.519
I'd like to see that.

01:07:43.826 --> 01:07:45.781
You shouldn't have
talked about my mama, Gates.

01:07:50.766 --> 01:07:52.202
Come on, boys.

01:07:53.001 --> 01:07:57.465
Now Casey, by law am I
allowed to start shooting yet?

01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:01.161
I don't know, are they trespassing?
- Oh, they're definitely trespassing.

01:08:01.710 --> 01:08:03.907
Then yes, sir. You can
legally start shooting.

01:08:19.795 --> 01:08:23.654
You gonna get that?
- Oh, if you don't mind.

01:08:23.832 --> 01:08:25.462
Yeah, it might be important.

01:08:28.937 --> 01:08:32.255
Hello? Yes!

01:08:34.446 --> 01:08:35.966
Why yes, we do
have vacancies!

01:08:37.246 --> 01:08:39.854
Well, good. We'll see
ya in a few, thanks!

01:08:42.082 --> 01:08:44.716
Hey, good news...
first customer!

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:47.493
Actually your second.
- Oh sorry, yeah... second.

01:08:47.890 --> 01:08:49.854
You know mr. Gates,
I can't help but notice that...

01:08:50.926 --> 01:08:53.948
You're one man short...
ratchet is it?

01:08:54.962 --> 01:08:55.988
Yeah...

01:08:57.599 --> 01:09:00.211
Yeah, Ratchet's sick.
- Right.

01:09:02.304 --> 01:09:03.705
I'll give ya this...

01:09:05.941 --> 01:09:08.390
for a lawyer,
you've got teeth.

01:09:09.176 --> 01:09:12.366
Well, not all of us start
out as lawyers. - Well...

01:09:15.984 --> 01:09:19.607
I'm really lookin' forward
to talkin' guns again with you.

01:09:20.822 --> 01:09:22.158
I'm sure we will.

01:09:24.693 --> 01:09:25.636
Soon.

01:09:26.828 --> 01:09:30.709
Soon.
- Come on... let's go.

01:09:31.899 --> 01:09:32.877
See ya, fellas!

01:09:39.140 --> 01:09:40.323
Geraldo...

01:10:01.797 --> 01:10:02.778
Whoops.

01:10:17.879 --> 01:10:19.061
Y'all forgot somethin'.

01:10:22.150 --> 01:10:24.542
Ohh... ahh!

01:10:26.054 --> 01:10:26.820
Pick him up.

01:10:28.090 --> 01:10:32.003
Ah! Ahhh! Hey!

01:10:35.397 --> 01:10:38.678
Come on, we gotta check on Pru.
Bring that scatter gun with ya.

01:10:38.713 --> 01:10:40.160
Gates was one man short.

01:10:46.742 --> 01:10:48.053
Let's do it.

01:11:01.757 --> 01:11:04.359
Pru?

01:11:10.165 --> 01:11:13.390
Don't you do it, Casey McKay!
- Hey, hey, take it easy.

01:11:13.735 --> 01:11:15.439
Would you mind
lowering the gun, please?

01:11:15.474 --> 01:11:17.856
You're late. - Yeah,
yeah. Well, we were busy.

01:11:18.907 --> 01:11:20.695
Now what are you doing
with that shotgun anyway?

01:11:21.877 --> 01:11:25.544
Somebody's ringin' my doorbell after dark.
- Bad guys don't  ring doorbells!

01:11:25.781 --> 01:11:28.477
Yeah, well... I'm not
taking any chances.

01:11:28.512 --> 01:11:31.189
Besides, where have you been? We've
been trying to call you the whole way up here.

01:11:31.353 --> 01:11:32.620
I've been busy.

01:11:34.156 --> 01:11:35.366
Come on.

01:11:38.427 --> 01:11:41.957
He was worried Gates had
gotten to me. Scared me to death.

01:11:43.732 --> 01:11:44.621
I'm sorry, aunt Pru.

01:11:47.736 --> 01:11:49.515
Hey, Kit. Good
to see you again.

01:11:50.272 --> 01:11:52.777
Why don't you uh... why
don't you go on and take a seat.

01:11:53.775 --> 01:11:55.705
I'm glad you're safe;
we've been worried about you.

01:12:01.783 --> 01:12:02.344
So where you been?

01:12:04.419 --> 01:12:06.681
Hiding.
- Yeah? Why?

01:12:09.324 --> 01:12:11.522
It's okay, Kit.
You can trust him.

01:12:13.795 --> 01:12:15.075
Uncle Casey, my...

01:12:18.500 --> 01:12:22.235
My father...
he killed mr. Jenkins.

01:12:23.772 --> 01:12:24.763
Hmm.

01:12:26.007 --> 01:12:27.661
And you know this for a fact?

01:12:28.376 --> 01:12:29.885
Of course I know.

01:12:31.012 --> 01:12:33.355
My whole life, he's been
telling me he's gonna change;

01:12:33.390 --> 01:12:35.060
telling me he's not gonna
make the same mistake twice.

01:12:36.952 --> 01:12:38.145
He was right about that.

01:12:39.154 --> 01:12:41.754
He made 'em a thousand times
and look where it's gotten him.

01:12:42.858 --> 01:12:45.460
Look, I just came to see aunt
Pru to make sure she was safe

01:12:45.460 --> 01:12:46.687
before we get outta town.

01:12:49.865 --> 01:12:52.813
How do you know
that he killed him?

01:12:53.869 --> 01:12:54.934
I was there.

01:12:56.404 --> 01:13:00.636
D.A. Jenkins is a
problem and he's a liability.

01:13:02.244 --> 01:13:03.459
That ends tonight.

01:13:05.213 --> 01:13:06.403
Do you understand?

01:13:07.449 --> 01:13:10.762
Or... you could end
up like Boots and Frog.

01:13:14.289 --> 01:13:15.315
Atta boy.

01:13:16.091 --> 01:13:17.675
What happens
when it's over, huh?

01:13:19.528 --> 01:13:23.106
You can come on
back here, I'll be gone.

01:13:23.999 --> 01:13:28.113
You and your boy here can ride
off into the sunset for all I care.

01:13:29.137 --> 01:13:31.900
And I don't cause
you're dead to me.

01:13:33.475 --> 01:13:36.114
We're gonna get
in that R.V., right?

01:13:38.413 --> 01:13:39.932
Check the water
pressure in the shower?

01:13:41.283 --> 01:13:42.580
Get in the cab...

01:13:43.385 --> 01:13:45.731
quit stallin'.

01:13:47.489 --> 01:13:50.072
Hey, the three of us?

01:13:52.260 --> 01:13:53.170
The four of us.

01:13:56.331 --> 01:13:58.359
The four of us are
gonna be in that R.V. soon.

01:13:58.967 --> 01:14:02.359
The four of you? How?
Who are the other two?

01:14:04.005 --> 01:14:07.071
It's okay, baby.
You can come on out.

01:14:09.845 --> 01:14:11.880
Um, Casey.
This here's Stella.

01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:15.232
So these two have
been married a year now.

01:14:18.587 --> 01:14:19.952
I sent you an invitation.

01:14:24.392 --> 01:14:25.950
Now, Kit uh...

01:14:26.995 --> 01:14:28.164
about the gunshot.

01:14:29.631 --> 01:14:31.132
Did you actually hear it?

01:14:31.867 --> 01:14:33.692
Well, no.
There was the train...

01:14:34.102 --> 01:14:37.733
Sirens and a
bunch of commotion.

01:14:45.981 --> 01:14:48.050
Freeze! Get on the ground!
- What about my dad?

01:14:49.284 --> 01:14:51.939
Oh, your daddy's going
back away for a while, boy.

01:14:53.121 --> 01:14:55.236
Hey, don't you think about it.

01:14:55.271 --> 01:14:56.584
Get back in here! Hey!

01:14:57.377 --> 01:14:58.480
Ah...

01:15:06.601 --> 01:15:08.425
You have the right
to remain silent.

01:15:08.460 --> 01:15:12.246
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

01:15:12.322 --> 01:15:14.255
You have the right
to an attorney.

01:15:14.409 --> 01:15:16.163
If you can not
afford an attorney,

01:15:16.198 --> 01:15:19.402
you're to be provided one.
- Watch your head.

01:15:46.041 --> 01:15:48.643
Well, I used the money
we'd saved to buy that R.V.

01:15:48.643 --> 01:15:52.224
And we've been hiding out in it ever
since; movin' to a new spot every day.

01:15:54.482 --> 01:15:56.628
Say, Ex...
- Hmm?

01:15:57.218 --> 01:15:58.368
Ratchet wasn't there tonight.

01:15:58.396 --> 01:15:59.874
Do you think you can
find him and flip him?

01:16:00.221 --> 01:16:02.407
Oh, probably.
- Great.

01:16:03.481 --> 01:16:05.218
Kit, I'm gonna need
you to hide out here.

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:08.042
No. Uncle Casey, we're leaving
town and you can't stop us.

01:16:08.163 --> 01:16:11.580
Now look... look Kit... if the
prosecutor gets a hold of you now,

01:16:11.615 --> 01:16:13.917
we might as well buy the
flowers for your daddy's funeral.

01:16:14.302 --> 01:16:17.026
Now you may be done with him,
but I know you don't want that.

01:16:18.540 --> 01:16:19.147
No, sir.

01:16:20.508 --> 01:16:21.250
Pru...

01:16:22.544 --> 01:16:24.171
Yeah? - You
got today's paper?

01:16:25.714 --> 01:16:27.899
I think we'd better
send a message to Jay.

01:16:29.384 --> 01:16:30.680
Yeah.

01:16:40.495 --> 01:16:42.263
You got a package.

01:17:03.318 --> 01:17:05.898
He wanted me to
scare the D.A. off his scent;

01:17:07.355 --> 01:17:10.131
Scare him from digging around
in mr. Gates' personal affairs.

01:17:10.558 --> 01:17:13.184
I didn't wear a
mask... gun in hand...

01:17:14.629 --> 01:17:16.299
He just wanted
me to scare him.

01:17:18.466 --> 01:17:19.243
That's what he told me.

01:17:36.084 --> 01:17:38.493
How do I know you're
not lying just to get a deal?

01:17:39.821 --> 01:17:42.506
And why is it now that
you're willing to testify?

01:18:00.675 --> 01:18:03.078
Because...

01:18:03.078 --> 01:18:04.948
because I'm gonna
be a grandfather...

01:18:08.216 --> 01:18:09.803
and my boy's
gonna be a father.

01:18:13.555 --> 01:18:15.559
I will spend an
eternity in prison...

01:18:17.222 --> 01:18:19.400
before I live to see
someone hurt them, okay?

01:18:22.197 --> 01:18:25.152
Now, right now they're safe.

01:18:26.568 --> 01:18:30.959
Man, I'm just nothin' but
a con with nothin' to lose...

01:18:34.242 --> 01:18:35.669
but a second chance to gain.

01:18:43.518 --> 01:18:46.504
He was blackmailing you?
- He was gonna hurt my boy.

01:18:53.361 --> 01:18:54.374
You were right.

01:18:55.130 --> 01:18:57.935
Henry had begun an
investigation on Gates.

01:18:58.733 --> 01:19:00.486
There's not enough
proof yet to bring him down,

01:19:00.568 --> 01:19:02.398
but definitely
enough to scare him.

01:19:03.404 --> 01:19:05.306
If what he's saying is true,

01:19:05.306 --> 01:19:07.798
there's no telling
how far Gates will go.

01:19:08.843 --> 01:19:12.317
I think the D.A. had already
been shot before Jay got to him.

01:19:12.747 --> 01:19:15.813
I think Gates set him up...
gave him the same gun

01:19:15.848 --> 01:19:17.598
with the same used
shell still in the chamber.

01:19:18.319 --> 01:19:19.943
In fact,
I'm convinced of it.

01:19:20.722 --> 01:19:23.247
In 30 years of breaking the law,
Jay never once used a gun.

01:19:24.526 --> 01:19:27.447
You really think they
were listening? - We'll see.

01:19:27.929 --> 01:19:31.670
You think it'll work? - It better,
or Jay's gonna be found guilty.

01:19:34.469 --> 01:19:36.789
Well, Dusty can't seem
to fix the power over there.

01:19:36.824 --> 01:19:37.781
What do you mean?

01:19:38.473 --> 01:19:40.516
The whole back section has
been out since we got started.

01:19:41.276 --> 01:19:43.100
Ben, I'll catch
up with you later.

01:20:35.797 --> 01:20:37.432
Mr.
- Hey, Jenkins...

01:21:17.272 --> 01:21:20.754
We're postponing the
closing arguments for a new witness.

01:21:21.776 --> 01:21:24.538
Will Jay Chambers
please take the stand?

01:21:26.781 --> 01:21:29.074
Mr. McKay, your witness.

01:21:31.719 --> 01:21:35.266
Mr. McKay! - Your honor, I'd
like to request a short recess.

01:21:39.327 --> 01:21:40.995
On what grounds?

01:21:40.995 --> 01:21:44.058
Uh, Your honor... I could
use that recess as well.

01:21:46.534 --> 01:21:51.211
We'll take an early lunch
and reconvene in 2 hours sharp.

01:21:52.974 --> 01:21:55.395
What about the plan?
- They jumped the plan.

01:21:55.843 --> 01:21:57.137
You wanted them to jump.

01:21:59.647 --> 01:22:03.685
Yeah, but not with Pru.
- Listen... - Jay, I'll handle it.

01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:05.349
If you're not
back in two hours,

01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:07.213
I'm gonna plead
guilty, alright?

01:22:08.141 --> 01:22:09.390
No one else is gonna
get hurt because of me.

01:22:09.390 --> 01:22:10.826
This ends with me, Casey.

01:22:14.862 --> 01:22:16.168
I hope that's enough time.

01:22:17.532 --> 01:22:18.990
I guess they
really were listening.

01:23:21.562 --> 01:23:24.056
You didn't tell me your great,

01:23:24.353 --> 01:23:28.249
great-granddaddy was the man who
chased Cutthroat Jimmy of West Texas.

01:23:30.104 --> 01:23:31.538
You didn't ask.

01:23:32.707 --> 01:23:33.834
Yeah.

01:23:34.509 --> 01:23:36.617
There's a few legends
in your family, isn't there?

01:23:37.912 --> 01:23:39.729
Rangers... all that kinda thing?

01:23:40.047 --> 01:23:43.050
See, that got me thinkin'
how someone like you could

01:23:43.050 --> 01:23:46.641
possibly get close to me and
maybe in fact bring me down.

01:23:48.589 --> 01:23:50.434
Well, you see now...
if I was one them...

01:23:51.926 --> 01:23:53.738
you'd already be
swingin' at the end of a rope.

01:23:57.131 --> 01:23:58.329
Now where's my wife?

01:23:59.967 --> 01:24:01.506
Prudence...

01:24:02.503 --> 01:24:03.811
Ouch.

01:24:07.575 --> 01:24:08.704
Now here's
what's gonna happen...

01:24:09.610 --> 01:24:13.743
you're gonna get Jay to
incriminate himself, and you...

01:24:14.115 --> 01:24:15.773
are going to
get out of my town.

01:24:16.217 --> 01:24:17.876
And we're all gonna
get back to normal.

01:24:18.219 --> 01:24:22.142
Nah, it's not gonna happen;
how about you and I cut a deal?

01:24:24.992 --> 01:24:27.477
Now, why would I do that?

01:24:28.629 --> 01:24:30.781
I'm the one
holding all the cards.

01:24:31.699 --> 01:24:32.990
You're holding
all the cards, huh?

01:24:35.036 --> 01:24:37.686
Well, not if one of your boys
here is willing to testify against you.

01:24:39.607 --> 01:24:41.766
Never gonna happen.
- You think?

01:24:43.177 --> 01:24:45.005
You didn't know you
had a weak link, did ya?

01:24:45.913 --> 01:24:46.965
Yeah, I didn't think so.

01:24:48.049 --> 01:24:51.127
Take a look right
there... you see that?

01:24:51.752 --> 01:24:54.205
You see, one of your
boys didn't shoot to kill,

01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:56.412
and now you've got
a fox in the hen house.

01:25:00.795 --> 01:25:01.938
Here's my offer to you...

01:25:03.030 --> 01:25:06.531
all the aforementioned
and your informant.

01:25:07.735 --> 01:25:10.814
And you get to
get that wife back.

01:25:12.573 --> 01:25:14.320
Or is it ex-wife?

01:25:17.211 --> 01:25:18.351
You think it out.

01:25:24.552 --> 01:25:25.727
Let me ask you a question.

01:25:27.889 --> 01:25:29.551
Do you believe in
second chances?

01:25:31.993 --> 01:25:35.422
No, I do not. - Well, neither
did I for the longest time.

01:25:35.897 --> 01:25:37.546
At least not for myself...

01:25:38.799 --> 01:25:40.951
not until I realized
how badly I needed one.

01:25:45.606 --> 01:25:47.632
See Gates, I've been
aiming high my whole life.

01:25:48.609 --> 01:25:52.055
But today... I'm willing
to level it out for you.

01:25:54.048 --> 01:25:55.431
Ahhh...

01:25:55.616 --> 01:25:57.957
so this is the way
it's going to go, huh?

01:26:01.722 --> 01:26:02.339
Well...

01:26:04.325 --> 01:26:06.561
it was always going
to come down to this.

01:26:22.009 --> 01:26:23.514
Okay. Jig's up, losers.

01:26:24.345 --> 01:26:26.393
Just relax and put
the guns on the ground.

01:26:34.055 --> 01:26:35.153
Sorry about that.

01:26:38.225 --> 01:26:42.207
Thank you... thank you.

01:26:43.631 --> 01:26:47.320
Hey, Casey, we found
Ratchet. He really was out sick!

01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:52.327
Ex... Pru... go ahead
and get 'em outta here.

01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:54.694
One at a time in
an orderly fashion.

01:26:54.842 --> 01:26:56.366
Somebody help
ol' stumpy there.

01:26:57.979 --> 01:26:59.222
Right this way.

01:27:03.818 --> 01:27:05.046
It's over, Gates.

01:27:05.853 --> 01:27:08.192
Nothing's over; it's never over.

01:27:08.789 --> 01:27:12.112
Nothing is over... nothing!!!

01:27:15.396 --> 01:27:17.230
See, your little D.A. Jenkins...

01:27:18.199 --> 01:27:19.877
He tried to end me.

01:27:20.668 --> 01:27:22.124
I shot him down.

01:27:24.238 --> 01:27:25.855
I'm gonna do the same to you.

01:27:25.906 --> 01:27:27.863
Once i've got you
out of my way,

01:27:29.176 --> 01:27:31.131
I'm going after Jay;
yea

01:27:31.879 --> 01:27:33.924
I'm gonna get him
and the little baby.

01:27:34.382 --> 01:27:37.229
They're never
gonna be safe... never!!!

01:27:37.752 --> 01:27:39.924
I'm just gonna finish
the whole thing off...

01:27:40.287 --> 01:27:43.932
I'm gonna get your Prudence,
and I'm gonna keep her for myself.

01:27:44.125 --> 01:27:45.564
You hear me?

01:27:47.228 --> 01:27:48.333
So what do
you think, boy?

01:27:49.730 --> 01:27:50.733
Are you man enough?

01:27:51.832 --> 01:27:53.139
Are you man enough?!

01:27:54.368 --> 01:27:56.483
Come on...
come on...

01:27:57.104 --> 01:27:58.163
Come on!!!

01:28:29.470 --> 01:28:32.555
Ah! Ahhh!!!!

01:28:35.376 --> 01:28:36.697
That's your second chance.

01:28:39.780 --> 01:28:41.521
You best just kill me.

01:28:42.283 --> 01:28:43.918
Nah, I don't think so,

01:28:44.719 --> 01:28:46.160
I'm more interested
in the truth.

01:28:47.988 --> 01:28:48.688
Ah...

01:28:57.164 --> 01:28:58.833
Ex, call the cops.

01:28:58.833 --> 01:29:00.391
Tell them we've got
their murder suspect.

01:29:03.137 --> 01:29:06.801
Good afternoon, county courthouse.
- Yeah, hi. I  need to get a message

01:29:06.836 --> 01:29:08.344
to Ben Wingwright immediately.

01:29:16.884 --> 01:29:19.793
Well, it's about time.
- I'm very sorry, Your honor.

01:29:23.457 --> 01:29:24.297
Your honor...

01:29:25.926 --> 01:29:29.133
I've been presented
with... new evidence

01:29:29.722 --> 01:29:34.505
and the state would like to drop
all charges against Jay Chambers.

01:29:38.873 --> 01:29:40.872
Well, now I've seen it all.

01:29:42.910 --> 01:29:44.551
Case dismissed.

01:29:48.349 --> 01:29:49.550
Thank you, Ben.

01:29:51.786 --> 01:29:53.205
Are you kidding me?
- You're a free man.

01:29:55.856 --> 01:29:59.550
Okay... okay there, Jay.
Congratulations, buddy.

01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:00.628
Thank you.

01:30:01.195 --> 01:30:02.100
Kit.

01:30:04.265 --> 01:30:05.205
Thank you.

01:30:06.467 --> 01:30:08.562
Kit... to a new start, boy!

01:30:09.003 --> 01:30:11.106
To a new start, dad.

01:30:11.839 --> 01:30:13.161
We won.
- Sure did!

01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:15.927
Now, could I interest
you in buying a hotel?

01:30:16.410 --> 01:30:19.856
Uh, I'd consider a negotiation.
First, work on gettin' that third customer.

01:30:20.014 --> 01:30:22.590
That's a good idea;
maybe ebay.

01:30:22.950 --> 01:30:25.415
Look at you,
you kept your streak!

01:30:26.854 --> 01:30:29.325
Oh... streak.
That old thing.

01:30:30.558 --> 01:30:32.631
Hmm, maybe you have changed.

01:30:33.861 --> 01:30:34.840
Hmm... maybe.

01:30:37.565 --> 01:30:41.527
Look, Pru ...
I'm sorry. I just...

01:30:43.437 --> 01:30:45.895
This may sound a
little cheesy but uh...

01:30:46.841 --> 01:30:48.306
I owe you an apology.

01:30:49.208 --> 01:30:51.792
I'm sorry for fighting for
everything else in my life but you.

01:30:53.214 --> 01:30:54.001
Well...

01:30:56.050 --> 01:30:58.087
that's all I have to
say about that but...

01:30:58.122 --> 01:31:00.521
ahem...

01:31:00.521 --> 01:31:02.135
if you'll have me back,

01:31:02.556 --> 01:31:06.535
I'll never quit fightin'
for you... for us.

01:31:14.839 --> 01:31:17.443
ONE YEAR LATER

01:31:55.342 --> 01:31:57.489
They finally made it
there in that old R.V.

01:31:57.524 --> 01:31:58.809
Alright! I knew they would.

01:32:06.453 --> 01:32:08.222
Hey, babe.

01:32:10.991 --> 01:32:12.218
Of all the rooms
in the house,

01:32:12.327 --> 01:32:14.098
how come you had to
set up in my dining room?

01:32:14.461 --> 01:32:16.915
'Cause that room's
got the best light!

01:32:18.065 --> 01:32:20.922
Hey, easy now. I got
a system going on there.

01:32:21.268 --> 01:32:24.279
You don't even have
an office! - Lawyer office.
