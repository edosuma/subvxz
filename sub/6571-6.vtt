<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

00:05.505 --> 00:07.496
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice...</i>

00:07.607 --> 00:09.598
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

00:15.148 --> 00:16.843
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

00:19.786 --> 00:22.687
<i>[Man Narrating] Michael was using</i>
<i>the Bluth Company crane...</i>

00:22.789 --> 00:27.021
<i>to retrieve the family-owned frozen banana stand</i>
<i>after it had been dumped in the bay...</i>

00:27.127 --> 00:29.960
<i>a holiday tradition</i>
<i>among the local youth.</i>

00:30.063 --> 00:33.863
- <i>Soon he returned home so that he and his son</i>- 
- George Michael?

00:33.967 --> 00:36.367
<i>Could share</i>
<i>their holiday tradition of rebuilding it.</i>

00:36.469 --> 00:38.937
- Another one of Dad's suits?
- Hey, I'm the president now.

00:39.039 --> 00:43.237
I'm filling Dad's shoes...
literally, except his shoes don't fit.

00:43.343 --> 00:45.607
But I did finally get
into Dad's pants...

00:45.712 --> 00:48.806
although I had to have
the crotch taken in a little.

00:48.915 --> 00:51.611
You know, Gob, maybe it's the suits,
but I think you may be beginning...

00:51.718 --> 00:54.812
to alienate some
of the employees down at work.

00:54.921 --> 00:57.446
What? Oh, that's great.

00:57.557 --> 01:00.993
The president has to worry
about alienating the employees now.

01:01.094 --> 01:04.620
<i>[Narrator] In fact, Gob</i> had <i>started</i>
<i>to alienate some ofhis colleagues.</i>

01:04.730 --> 01:09.464
The worst that could happen is I could
spill some on my $3,000 suit. Come on!

01:09.569 --> 01:12.436
- Hey!
- The guy in the $4,000 suit...

01:12.539 --> 01:15.406
is holding the elevator for the guy
who doesn't make that in three months.

01:17.377 --> 01:19.811
Why don't I just take a whiz
through this $5,000 suit?

01:19.913 --> 01:23.440
Come on! They like me just fine.
You'll see that tonight...

01:23.550 --> 01:26.951
when they toast me at the Christmas party,
just like they used to with Dad.

01:27.053 --> 01:29.214
They used to <i>roast</i> Dad
'cause they thought that...

01:29.322 --> 01:32.257
he had a sense of humor about himself,
but he didn't, and neither do you.

01:32.358 --> 01:35.418
Hey, nobody laughed louder
than me at any joke about Dad.

01:35.528 --> 01:39.464
<i>You're the one who's all Mr.</i>
<i>"I take myself too seriously all the time."</i>

01:39.566 --> 01:42.433
<i>[Narrator] Michael did tend to take</i>
<i>the Christmas party somewhat seriously.</i>

01:42.535 --> 01:45.834
Merry Christmas. You can go ahead
and put that right in the charity barrel.

01:45.939 --> 01:48.737
Thanks a lot. Sorry, pal.
We just can't have them resent us.

01:48.842 --> 01:52.903
<i>I know some of the numbers haven't all</i>
<i>added up, and there is some speculation...</i>

01:53.012 --> 01:56.812
that George has been into the kitty-

01:56.916 --> 01:59.111
- <i>[Laughter]</i>
- "Into the kitty"! That's awesome.

01:59.219 --> 02:02.882
[Whispering] Fire Tom
and get your jackass brother out of here.

02:02.989 --> 02:06.618
This year I'm not officially president,
and it'll be nice to actually have some fun...

02:06.726 --> 02:08.990
with my son
at a Christmas party.

02:09.095 --> 02:11.893
- Thank God I don't have to go.
- So glad to hear you say that.

02:11.998 --> 02:13.795
I wanna meet someone there.

02:13.900 --> 02:16.232
What? So I'm not invited to
the Bluth Company Christmas party?

02:16.336 --> 02:19.965
Oh, honey, of course
you can go if you want to.

02:20.073 --> 02:23.133
- Thanks, Mom.
- No. You're not going to that.

02:23.243 --> 02:26.735
You see, if I show up with you,
it'll just make me seem like I'm a mother.

02:26.846 --> 02:29.508
- I've never thought of you that way.
- That's sweet.

02:29.616 --> 02:34.849
<i>Well, I won't be going. I will</i>
<i>be head to toe in blue makeup until 8:01...</i>

02:34.954 --> 02:36.888
in case the Blue Man Group
needs their understudy, so-

02:36.990 --> 02:39.481
No, no, you have to go.
So when men find out...

02:39.592 --> 02:41.924
we're in an open relationship,
they'll see you're no threat.

02:42.028 --> 02:46.089
People hear the name Tobias,
they think big, black guy.

02:46.199 --> 02:48.724
Well, obviously I'm not a big guy.

02:48.835 --> 02:51.429
I'm not a Carl Weathers, <i>par exemple.</i>

02:51.538 --> 02:54.701
I forgot about Carl.
Is he still single?

02:54.807 --> 02:58.675
Hey, George Michael, I need you
to help me fix up the banana stand.

02:58.778 --> 03:01.178
No, I can't. I was supposed
to go to Ann's parents' Christmas party.

03:01.281 --> 03:04.876
- We're makin' yams.
- Tonight? Tonight is the office party.

03:04.984 --> 03:08.852
Well, did you want me to go to that? You're
always telling me not to have fun at those things.

03:08.955 --> 03:12.186
Yes. We might even
snatch a gift from the charity barrel.

03:12.292 --> 03:16.854
Oh. Okay, well-well, I think Ann's parents
are having their party on Bethlehem time...

03:16.963 --> 03:19.022
which is pretty early,
so maybe I can make an appearance.

03:19.132 --> 03:22.260
Make an appearance?
Uh- Uh- No, no. It's okay.

03:22.368 --> 03:25.132
- You be with Yam. It's fine. It's good.
- It's Ann.

03:25.238 --> 03:27.536
It's good. Have fun.

03:27.640 --> 03:31.167
<i>The boy's pulling away from you.</i>
<i>Are we having yams?</i>

03:31.277 --> 03:34.212
Yeah, I don't know what's goin' on with him.
You know, he's on Bethlehem time.

03:34.314 --> 03:36.248
He's spending every moment
of the day with this girl.

03:36.349 --> 03:39.216
- It's, like, I'm his father.
He should be spending most-
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:39.319 --> 03:43.756
Don't get involved. Believe me. When
I thought your first wife was driving us apart...

03:43.856 --> 03:45.824
I did not make a stink.

03:45.925 --> 03:50.555
You complained all the time,
and she was my only wife. And she died.

03:50.663 --> 03:53.826
Well, see, things have a way
of working themselves out.

03:53.933 --> 03:56.731
- <i>[Phone Ringing]</i>
- Nonetheless, it's family first at the holidays.

03:56.836 --> 03:59.566
- Oh, God. It's Mom again.
- <i>Put it on speakerphone.</i>

03:59.672 --> 04:02.140
I wanna hear
her beautiful voice.

04:02.242 --> 04:04.972
[Screams] Michael! There's a hole in the window!
There's been a break-in!

04:05.078 --> 04:07.308
- Get over here!
- I'm leaving now.

04:07.413 --> 04:09.381
Sounds tense.

04:09.482 --> 04:13.851
That means she's not gettin' any
from my brother, Oscar. Lovely. That's nice.

04:16.221 --> 04:19.190
I heard about the banana stand,
and now there's been a break-in.

04:19.291 --> 04:22.625
But I have a surprise
for whoever it is if he comes back.

04:22.729 --> 04:25.254
First I blow him;
then I poke him.

04:25.365 --> 04:28.334
Guy has no idea
what he's in for.

04:28.434 --> 04:33.133
You know, Mom, all the glass seems to be
on the outside. Plus, here's your little statue...

04:33.239 --> 04:37.175
<i>so I guess what this says to me is,</i>
<i>I doubt anyone was trying to break in, Mom.</i>

04:37.277 --> 04:40.269
If anything, someone was trying
to break out. Where is Oscar?

04:40.380 --> 04:43.781
Well, he's on his walkabout
or pilgrimage.

04:43.883 --> 04:47.444
<i>[Narrator] Every year,</i>
<i>Oscar attempts the 420-mile walk...</i>

04:47.553 --> 04:50.215
<i>from Newport Beach</i>
<i>to Berkeley, California.</i>

04:50.323 --> 04:53.121
<i>In the 12 years</i>
<i>he's attempted this...</i>

04:53.226 --> 04:56.992
<i>he's never made it past U.C. Irvine.</i>

04:57.096 --> 05:00.554
He calls it a quest to recharge his chi.
I call it an excuse for him...

05:00.667 --> 05:03.135
to score his pot
and wag his pickle at coeds.

05:03.236 --> 05:06.399
You sound mad, Mom, mad enough
to throw one of these little lady heads at him.

05:06.506 --> 05:10.602
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Well, maybe you're a little bit lonely...

05:10.710 --> 05:13.144
and you're acting out
for attention.

05:13.246 --> 05:16.306
That's ridiculous.
I want you to move in with me.

05:16.416 --> 05:20.352
What? No. No. No.
No, no, no, no.

05:20.453 --> 05:23.752
Didn't you adopt a child for this very reason?
So that you would never be alone?

05:23.856 --> 05:27.223
Michael, a mother doesn't have a child
to give herself company.

05:27.327 --> 05:30.990
- Annyong was to teach Buster a lesson.
- And where is that little lesson?

05:31.097 --> 05:35.932
I sent him to the Milford Academy to
teach <i>him</i> a lesson. I can't remember about what.

05:36.035 --> 05:39.027
And Buster left this morning
to finish his army training.

05:39.138 --> 05:43.768
<i>[Narrator] In fact, Lucille had refused</i>
<i>to drive him to the army base...</i>

05:43.876 --> 05:46.777
<i>so Buster was taking</i>
<i>his very first bus ride.</i>

05:46.879 --> 05:49.279
- I can't change a hundred.
- Oh.

05:50.717 --> 05:54.619
Oh, God. Oh.

05:54.721 --> 05:58.054
<i>[Narrator] And that's when Buster</i>
<i>saw something interesting.</i>

05:59.826 --> 06:02.420
That could be good for army.
[Laughs]

06:02.528 --> 06:05.088
[Imitates Whirring Crane]

06:05.198 --> 06:09.396
<i>[Narrator] Whilejust 20 yards away,</i>
<i>Michael went to work repairing the banana stand.</i>

06:09.502 --> 06:11.367
[Michael]
What are you doin' here?

06:11.471 --> 06:14.872
My mom signed me out of school early,
so she wouldn't have to pick me up later...

06:14.974 --> 06:17.033
so she wouldn't be late
for the Christmas party.

06:17.143 --> 06:19.771
- That's about the worst thing I've ever heard.
- I had to drive...

06:19.879 --> 06:23.076
- because she had a little bit of a buzz on.
- No. That's it.

06:23.182 --> 06:26.879
- You doing this alone?
- Yeah. Well, thanks.

06:26.986 --> 06:30.046
I guess George Michael's gettin' a little too old
to hang out with his dad.

06:30.156 --> 06:33.057
- Yeah, and I'm getting too old
for my mom to be with me.
- You know what?

06:33.159 --> 06:35.559
- Maybe we should go to this party together.
- Really?

06:35.661 --> 06:38.289
Yeah. You're my little niece. I think
we should be spending more time together.

06:38.398 --> 06:42.892
- And if it makes my mom jealous-
- And George Michael can run back
to his precious Ann.

06:43.002 --> 06:45.630
Great. Good deal.

06:52.578 --> 06:54.409
<i>[Bells Jingling]</i>

06:54.514 --> 06:57.779
<i>[Narrator] Michael and Maeby stopped</i>
<i>by the office to see if Gob needed help...</i>

06:57.884 --> 06:59.943
<i>for the party</i>
<i>that was now hours away.</i>

07:00.052 --> 07:02.748
...king $6,300 suit!

07:02.855 --> 07:05.187
- Come on!
- Hi there.

07:05.291 --> 07:10.160
- What's she doin' here?
- Merry Christmas to you too, Uncle Gob.

07:10.263 --> 07:13.926
- Everything all right?
- I just don't want people's kids
getting their sticky fingers...

07:14.033 --> 07:15.933
all over these $2,600 pants.

07:16.035 --> 07:18.094
Oh, yeah? You think
they're gonna go right for the pants?

07:18.204 --> 07:23.267
Okay, okay, okay. So, should-
should- should- should, should, should-

07:23.376 --> 07:27.369
- Shh.
- Should- should- should-

07:27.480 --> 07:29.607
<i>We'll do it your way.</i>
<i>I'm just here to have fun.</i>

07:29.715 --> 07:32.809
Not too much fun, all right? I already
gave my big sexual harassment speech today.

07:32.919 --> 07:36.218
And please refrain from
discussing or engaging...

07:36.322 --> 07:39.223
in any sort of interoffice-
[Bleeps]

07:39.325 --> 07:41.816
<i>Or-[Bleeps]</i>
<i>Or finger-[Bleeps]</i>

07:41.928 --> 07:44.954
Or- [Bleeps] fisting
or- [Bleeps]

07:45.064 --> 07:51.003
Or even- [Bleeps] even though
so many people in this office are begging for it.

07:51.103 --> 07:55.005
And if anybody does anything
with my sister Lindsay...

07:55.107 --> 07:59.476
<i>I'll take off my pants,</i>
<i>I'll shave-[Bleeps]</i>

07:59.579 --> 08:01.809
And I'll personally-
[Long Bleep]

08:01.914 --> 08:04.007
- Let's get this going.
- What are you talking about?

08:04.116 --> 08:06.676
Now? You're not gonna let these people
go home and change their clothes?

08:06.786 --> 08:10.187
I don't think we need people tryin'
to compete with what I'm wearing.

08:10.289 --> 08:14.316
Everybody, come out of your offices, please.
The party has now started.

08:14.427 --> 08:19.228
- Here we go. Let's go.
- [Stereo: Disco]

08:21.200 --> 08:24.692
Everybody dance now.

08:24.804 --> 08:28.069
[Over Microphone]
Everybody dance <i>now.</i>

08:29.976 --> 08:32.672
I think we're off
to a great start.

08:32.778 --> 08:36.009
<i>[Narrator] And so, Michael started</i>
<i>to become relaxed, and a short time later...</i>

08:36.115 --> 08:38.140
<i>his mother arrived anything but.</i>

08:38.251 --> 08:41.277
Someone broke in again.
The liquor is gone. All of it- gone.

08:41.386 --> 08:44.413
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>In fact, Gob had stolen it earlier that day...</i>

08:44.524 --> 08:46.617
<i>to cut down on the cost</i>
<i>of the party.</i>

08:46.726 --> 08:51.186
- Hey, need a hand with that?
- No, Al. I wanna spill booze all over my f-

08:51.297 --> 08:54.698
- I'm all alone there, Michael.
- You know, Buster's only
stationed about five miles away.

08:54.800 --> 08:57.735
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>In fact, Buster never went to the army.</i>

08:57.837 --> 09:02.740
- <i>He'd gotten hooked playing the skill crane</i>
<i>and missed his first day.</i>
- [Trilling]

09:02.842 --> 09:06.869
- <i>Somewhat ashamed and with nowhere</i>
<i>to go, he returned home.</i>
- Hey, Buster.

09:06.979 --> 09:09.539
- <i>[Door Closes]</i>
- [Gasps] Buster!

09:09.649 --> 09:14.313
Thank God you're back!
There's no shame in being a coward.

09:14.420 --> 09:17.287
A coward? I'm not a coward.

09:17.390 --> 09:20.951
- Would a coward have this?
- What the hell is that?

09:21.060 --> 09:24.655
These are my awards, Mother,
from army.

09:24.764 --> 09:26.994
The seal is for marksmanship...

09:27.099 --> 09:30.398
and the gorilla is for sand racing.

09:30.503 --> 09:33.631
- You're doing well?
- I was just dropping these off.

09:33.739 --> 09:38.073
Now, if you'll excuse me, they're
putting me in something called Hero Squad.

09:38.177 --> 09:41.408
You have no idea what it's like
to be abandoned by your son.

09:41.514 --> 09:44.005
Do you see my son?
He chose his girlfriend over me.

09:44.116 --> 09:48.746
How the worm has turned.
Look who feels the sting of an ungrateful child.

09:48.854 --> 09:51.448
Mother, you have
to receive something to be ungrateful.

09:51.557 --> 09:54.526
I'm not gettin' worked up over it tonight.
I'm not gonna let anything bother me.

09:54.627 --> 10:00.065
Good. I'll get a drink and then go home
and wait for you to come stay with me.

10:00.166 --> 10:02.760
Thank God they've got my brands here.

10:02.868 --> 10:04.802
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>This was an unacceptable solution.</i>

10:04.904 --> 10:10.774
Hey, Tobias, it's Michael. I hope you get this.
I need you to go over to my mother's tonight.

10:10.876 --> 10:13.106
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>Unfortunately, Tobias missed the call...</i>

10:13.212 --> 10:15.112
<i>and it went through</i>
<i>to Michael's home voice mail.</i>

10:15.214 --> 10:17.444
- The Blue Men!
- [Phone Beeps]

10:17.550 --> 10:20.951

10:33.833 --> 10:36.233
<i>[Narrator] And Lindsay showed up</i>
<i>at the Christmas party.</i>

10:36.335 --> 10:40.795
<i>Unfortunately, she didn't realize the employees</i>
<i>had been threatened against flirting.</i>

10:40.906 --> 10:45.309
Oh, hello, Ted. Oh, if you're worried
about my husband, it's fine.

10:45.411 --> 10:49.973
He's no bigger than a Cub Scout. You could
take him, and you could certainly take me.

What about this one? She's got thick arms.

15:28.027 --> 15:31.155
Mom, you just need to calm down a little bit.
You're so tense.

How am I supposed
to calm down?

15:33.565 --> 15:37.763
