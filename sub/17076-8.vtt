00:01.535 --> 00:03.535
- Hey, will, you ever meet
jeff clarke?

00:03.537 --> 00:05.371
- You were a firefighter, right?
- That's right.

00:05.372 --> 00:07.206
- You're in med school?
- I hurt my back on the job,

00:07.208 --> 00:09.775
so no more lugging
fire hose.

00:09.777 --> 00:12.511
- Oh, hey, did you fill in brett
on next weekend's festivities?

00:12.513 --> 00:15.014
- It's their parents'
anniversary party.

00:15.016 --> 00:18.450
- I can't do this.
Camila and I...

00:18.452 --> 00:20.552
Are getting divorced.

00:23.357 --> 00:25.357
- Hey, come on.
It's not what you think.

00:25.359 --> 00:27.593
- The hell it isn't.
- Listen, I was--I was--

00:27.595 --> 00:29.528
I was just looking--
- I thought you had a job.

00:29.530 --> 00:31.797
- I do, I told you.
I'm a firefighter.

00:31.799 --> 00:34.266
- That's really lame,
using a noble profession

00:34.268 --> 00:36.735
like that to impress women.
- Come on.

00:36.737 --> 00:39.071
- Be glad I don't
press charges.

00:45.479 --> 00:47.246
- I heard my dad give
this speech once

00:47.248 --> 00:48.747
to the entire church.

00:48.749 --> 00:50.682
It was on mother's day.

00:50.684 --> 00:53.819
And he talked about commitment
and loyalty

00:53.821 --> 00:56.488
and his unbreakable love
for her.

00:56.490 --> 00:58.090
- Gabby.
- I mean, if they couldn't

00:58.092 --> 01:01.126
make it, why would I think
anyone can make it?

01:01.128 --> 01:03.195
What does marriage
even mean anymore?

01:03.197 --> 01:05.297
- Gabby.
- What?

01:05.299 --> 01:07.800
Oh, hey.
Hey.

01:07.802 --> 01:10.436
You ready for your cereal?

01:10.438 --> 01:12.237
- Be right there, buddy.

01:12.239 --> 01:14.373
- Okay, matt.

01:19.246 --> 01:20.512
- Matt?

01:20.514 --> 01:22.514
- I know, but what is he
supposed to call you?

01:27.455 --> 01:31.590
- Gabby, whatever your parents
did or didn't do...

01:31.592 --> 01:33.692
None of it affects us.

01:38.199 --> 01:40.299
- Yeah.

01:41.602 --> 01:43.602
- All right.

01:43.604 --> 01:46.605
Cheerios for the 20th day
in a row, huh?

01:46.607 --> 01:48.707
Huh?
Good boy.

01:56.750 --> 01:58.851
Mister sippy.

02:07.361 --> 02:11.263
Yum.
That's good.

02:11.265 --> 02:12.898
- Hey, what you got there?

02:12.900 --> 02:14.466
- Molly's books.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.835
And I think I'm gonna need
a new red pen.

02:16.837 --> 02:18.687
- That bad, huh?

02:18.688 --> 02:20.538
- It's been a<i> dia de los muertos</i>
around there lately.

02:20.541 --> 02:22.908
I look up the other day and
there's four people in the bar.

02:22.910 --> 02:24.710
And one of them was mouch.

02:24.712 --> 02:26.478
- I drink for two.

02:26.480 --> 02:28.680
- You know,
these things are cyclical.

02:28.682 --> 02:30.849
- Yeah? Well, let me know when
the wheels are gonna turn again

02:30.851 --> 02:34.186
so I can tell my kids
they can go to college.

02:34.188 --> 02:35.754
- Mind if I take a look
at that?

02:35.756 --> 02:39.391
- Be my guest.

02:42.363 --> 02:45.464

02:59.813 --> 03:01.797
- What's going on?

03:01.798 --> 03:03.782
- I was walking by; I heard
a boom like something exploded.

03:03.784 --> 03:05.918
Came from back there.

03:15.563 --> 03:16.862
- You smell that?

03:16.864 --> 03:18.497
- There's nothing
on the gas meter.

03:18.499 --> 03:21.600
- Let's get it turned off
anyway. Mask up.

03:23.837 --> 03:25.971
Open up, fire department.

03:28.475 --> 03:32.277
Fire department.

03:32.279 --> 03:34.680
- Whoa! Whoa, hey, man.

03:34.682 --> 03:36.282
[high-pitched beeping]
how's it going?

03:36.283 --> 03:37.883
- You got something cooking
in your apartment?

03:37.885 --> 03:41.753
- Uh, just a problem with,
like, the fridge.

03:41.755 --> 03:43.855
But it's--it's not a f--

03:48.796 --> 03:50.395
- a problem, huh?

03:50.397 --> 03:52.531
- Uh, like I said,
it's nothing.

03:52.533 --> 03:54.333
My fridge is on the fritz.

03:54.335 --> 03:56.435
<i> - Gas is off, lieutenant.</i>

04:00.941 --> 04:03.675
- Using butane to extract
hash oil indoors?

04:03.677 --> 04:04.743
You know how stupid that is?

04:04.745 --> 04:06.378
- Hey, man,
I got a prescription.

04:06.380 --> 04:09.348
It's all good.
- No, man, it's not all good.

04:09.350 --> 04:11.516
Butane evaporates,
needs ventilation.

04:11.518 --> 04:13.518
- Hey, man,
where are you going?

04:13.520 --> 04:14.987
- You toss it in a fridge,

04:14.989 --> 04:16.888
you got a box full
of combustible fumes.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.724
- Well, I got blurry vision
or something, man.

04:18.726 --> 04:20.325
My doctor said I got--
- that doesn't give you

04:20.327 --> 04:24.663
a prescription to turn your
freezer into a time bomb.

04:24.665 --> 04:26.999
- Severide!
- Get down!

04:27.001 --> 04:28.333
[exploding]

04:34.642 --> 04:37.576
- hey. Hey, hey.
Hey, you okay?

04:43.917 --> 04:46.785
Hey, dawson, brett, get me
a c-collar and a backboard

04:46.787 --> 04:48.887
down here now!

04:57.431 --> 04:59.898
- Let me take a quick look.

04:59.900 --> 05:02.334
- Moron was home cooking
hash oil.

05:02.336 --> 05:03.735
Knocked him unconscious
in the blast.

05:03.737 --> 05:07.539
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

05:07.541 --> 05:08.674
- Pupils are responsive.

05:08.676 --> 05:12.611
- All right,
let's get him in the rig.

05:12.613 --> 05:15.547
- Oh, god.
Oh, god!

05:15.549 --> 05:18.550
Sam!
What happened?

05:18.552 --> 05:20.986
- It's okay, ma'am.
He just bumped his head.

05:20.988 --> 05:24.656
- What's that smell?
- He was cooking hash.

05:24.658 --> 05:25.791
- Hashbrowns?

05:25.793 --> 05:29.428
- No, honey, hash.
Drugs.

05:29.430 --> 05:31.063
- One of you guys want
to ride along with us?

05:31.065 --> 05:34.366
- I'll go...So I can beat
his ass when he comes to.

05:45.479 --> 05:47.612
[indistinct chatter]

06:01.462 --> 06:03.628
- you okay, sir?

06:03.630 --> 06:06.031
- Not at all.

06:06.033 --> 06:08.066
- Well, your son's breathing
is normal,

06:08.068 --> 06:09.668
his blood pressure is good,

06:09.670 --> 06:12.771
and other than a slight
concussion, he's fine.

06:15.476 --> 06:17.609
- You never stop worrying.

06:20.381 --> 06:22.681
From when he fell off the slide
in kindergarten

06:22.683 --> 06:24.983
to the time he drove a jet ski
into a wooden dock

06:24.985 --> 06:26.685
his senior year...

06:26.687 --> 06:28.687
His mother and I
have worried

06:28.689 --> 06:30.789
every time the phone rang.

06:36.163 --> 06:38.730
- I'm a new mom myself.

06:38.732 --> 06:42.100
- Are you?
[chuckles]

06:42.102 --> 06:45.437
well, it's a roller coaster.

07:15.636 --> 07:18.703
- So, did you know that
before molly's was molly's,

07:18.705 --> 07:20.739
it was called
the wolcott street pub?

07:20.741 --> 07:22.207
- So?
- So, did you know

07:22.209 --> 07:25.076
that the wolcott street pub
was incorporated

07:25.078 --> 07:29.047
on December 6th, 1916?

07:29.049 --> 07:31.082
- Mm, fascinating.

07:31.084 --> 07:35.754
- That means that Tuesday
is the 100-year anniversary

07:35.756 --> 07:39.991
of when molly's bar
became a bar.

07:39.993 --> 07:42.627
- You guys should throw
a big blow-out party.

07:42.629 --> 07:45.063
- Yes! That's exactly
what I'm talking about.

07:45.065 --> 07:47.732
Molly's needs jumper cables
to the...[groans]

07:47.734 --> 07:50.602
right now and this is
exactly how we do it.

07:50.604 --> 07:54.039
- A centennial celebration.
- A what now?

07:54.041 --> 07:56.575
- That is a damn good idea,
otis.

07:56.577 --> 07:57.709
- Thank you.
- What is?

07:57.711 --> 08:00.178
- 100-year anniversary party
for molly's.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.880
- What will it cost?

08:01.882 --> 08:04.182
- Not as much as it would cost
not to do it.

08:04.184 --> 08:06.168
- Cool with me.

08:06.169 --> 08:08.153
- "sun-times" culture section
loves this kind of thing.

08:08.155 --> 08:10.689
- Casey, you gotta have
connections at the paper.

08:10.691 --> 08:13.825
Do you think you could, uh,
help us out with publicity?

08:13.827 --> 08:15.994
- I can call.

08:15.996 --> 08:18.930
- [grunts]

08:18.932 --> 08:21.032
ow!

08:28.575 --> 08:30.041
- You should get that
looked at.

08:30.043 --> 08:32.177
- You should worry
about yourself.

08:52.699 --> 08:55.100
- Hey.
- [exhales deeply]

08:55.102 --> 08:57.102
what am I doing?

08:57.104 --> 09:00.539
- What?

09:00.541 --> 09:02.641
- What's the purpose?

09:04.945 --> 09:09.281
- Okay, you're gonna have to
help me out here.

09:09.283 --> 09:11.983
- This morning...

09:11.985 --> 09:15.987
The girl I had a very nice time
with is in the bathroom,

09:15.989 --> 09:20.692
and I realize
I can't remember her name.

09:20.694 --> 09:24.963
It is jessica?
Is it jennifer?

09:24.965 --> 09:30.168
And so I slyly
look in her purse,

09:30.170 --> 09:33.104
and see if I can find
her driver's license.

09:33.106 --> 09:36.074
[laughter]
- she caught you.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.709
- She thought
I was ripping her off.

09:37.711 --> 09:40.979
- No. Oh, so what was it?

09:40.981 --> 09:42.981
Jennifer? Jessica?

09:42.983 --> 09:45.216
- I don't know.
[laughter]

09:45.218 --> 09:48.253
I don't know.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.789
I'm serious, man.
What am I doing?

09:50.791 --> 09:54.993
- Uh, everything that everyone
else wishes they could do.

10:00.133 --> 10:01.633
- You know what I felt today

10:01.635 --> 10:07.105
as I got blasted in the head
by a fireball?

10:07.107 --> 10:09.240
Nothing.

10:14.715 --> 10:16.348
- Let's get away.

10:16.350 --> 10:19.351
Boys fishing trip
someplace warm.

10:19.353 --> 10:22.721
Beers, cigars,
and a boat.

10:22.723 --> 10:27.025
Get the hell out of chicago
and recharge our batteries.

10:27.027 --> 10:30.795
- Yeah?
Where you thinking?

10:30.797 --> 10:33.932
- I don't know.
Tampa? Miami? Whatever.

10:37.704 --> 10:41.072
- Yeah, I could get behind
this idea.

10:41.074 --> 10:42.240
- All righty then.

10:42.242 --> 10:43.274
- Matt, you got a minute?

10:43.276 --> 10:44.876
Tina from dcfs is here.

10:44.878 --> 10:47.646
- Uh, yeah, yeah. Sure.
Okay.

10:47.648 --> 10:50.782
This...[whirrs]
is happening.

10:58.992 --> 11:01.126
Hi, tina.
- Hi.

11:01.128 --> 11:03.261
Some of louie's medical files
came across my desk.

11:03.263 --> 11:05.730
- Is something wrong?
- No, not at all.

11:05.732 --> 11:08.333
But I saw in louie's files
that the court has granted

11:08.335 --> 11:12.437
permanency placement for him
after 90 days.

11:12.439 --> 11:15.624
- Meaning?

11:15.625 --> 11:18.810
- There's a fast track process
if you want to adopt.

11:18.812 --> 11:20.745
The one disclaimer
I'll throw at you

11:20.747 --> 11:24.683
is the court will view you,
gabby, as a single parent.

11:24.685 --> 11:29.254
- Even--even though
we're living together?

11:29.256 --> 11:32.891
- Yes.
But here's the paperwork

11:32.893 --> 11:35.126
if you want to get started.

11:35.128 --> 11:38.863
- Yeah, we do. Definitely.
- Yeah.

11:38.865 --> 11:40.865
[alarm blaring]

11:40.867 --> 11:43.702
<i> - ambulance 61, man down</i>
<i> from unknown causes.</i>

11:43.704 --> 11:45.837

<i> - 1600 armitrage.</i>

11:45.839 --> 11:48.139
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

11:48.141 --> 11:50.241
You take care.
- Yeah, you too.

12:09.830 --> 12:11.496
- Everyone okay here?

12:11.498 --> 12:13.798
- Over there.

12:19.005 --> 12:21.106
- Sir, you all right?

12:27.013 --> 12:29.047
One, two, three.

12:29.049 --> 12:33.184
- [gasps]
ahh! Oh, no, no, no!

12:38.759 --> 12:42.160
- No crepitus.
Brett, grab me a c-collar.

12:42.162 --> 12:44.162
- [groaning]
- brett?

12:44.164 --> 12:47.165
- Okay, okay.

12:47.167 --> 12:48.933
- Sir?
- [groans]

12:48.935 --> 12:50.902
- sir, can you hear me?

12:50.904 --> 12:52.804
Hey, chuckles,
can you open your eyes?

12:52.806 --> 12:55.340
Talk to me.

12:55.342 --> 12:57.008
- [groans]
my head.

12:57.010 --> 12:59.043
- Yeah, your head.
You got quite a gash there.

12:59.045 --> 13:00.545
What happened?

13:00.547 --> 13:02.881
- I have no idea.

13:05.886 --> 13:09.020
- You okay?

13:09.022 --> 13:11.489
- It's a clown.
- It's an idiot with makeup on.

13:11.491 --> 13:14.025
Some internet fad
scaring people.

13:14.027 --> 13:15.927
- Well, it works.
Ah!

13:15.929 --> 13:17.395
- I'm fine, I'm fine.
- Hey, hey, hey.

13:17.397 --> 13:20.131
Hey, hey.
- What happened?

13:20.133 --> 13:23.368
- What do we got?
- Clown down, head injury.

13:23.370 --> 13:25.870
- Clown down?
That's a first.

13:25.872 --> 13:29.874
- Well, I'm guessing it's got
something to do with that.

13:29.876 --> 13:31.309
Pupils are responsive.
What's your name?

13:31.311 --> 13:35.046
- Bo.
- Bo, what were you doing?

13:35.048 --> 13:37.515
- I saw it online.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.818
I thought it looked fun.

13:43.156 --> 13:45.390
- What happened here?
- No idea.

13:45.392 --> 13:47.592
- He just hit himself
in the head?

13:47.594 --> 13:49.994
- Who knows what goes through
the head of a guy like that?

13:49.996 --> 13:53.064
- Besides a baseball bat.

13:53.066 --> 13:55.099
- I think I was ambushed.

13:55.101 --> 13:57.035
- Just don't talk.

13:57.037 --> 13:58.870
- Boo!

13:58.872 --> 14:01.039
- I'm driving.

14:02.943 --> 14:06.277
- Boom.
[laughter]

14:06.279 --> 14:08.179
- that's not a word.
- Since when?

14:08.181 --> 14:09.881
If I had a nickel
ever time my mom said,

14:09.883 --> 14:12.183
"harold, stop all the grabass."

14:12.185 --> 14:14.953
- this conversation's
making me uncomfortable.

14:14.955 --> 14:16.588
- Try again, buddy.

14:16.590 --> 14:19.924
- Help you, chief?
- Show me your neck.

14:24.164 --> 14:25.430
Why didn't you
get that treated?

14:25.432 --> 14:27.398
- Ambo was gone.
I put some stuff on it

14:27.400 --> 14:30.602
from the first aid kit.
It's fine.

14:30.604 --> 14:33.304
Who told you?

14:33.306 --> 14:35.240
- Get to med, pronto.

14:35.242 --> 14:37.375
Capp,
you're acting lieutenant.

14:42.148 --> 14:44.983
- Oh, okay, lieutenant.

14:44.985 --> 14:46.351
How about you
stop the grabass?

14:46.353 --> 14:47.619
Wash the rig
while I'm gone.

14:47.621 --> 14:51.422
- Will do.
- [laughs]

14:51.424 --> 14:53.524
- it's a word.

15:00.233 --> 15:02.267
- Hey, brett,

15:02.269 --> 15:05.637
why don't sharks eat clowns?

15:05.639 --> 15:08.473
Because they taste funny.

15:08.475 --> 15:11.042
- Good one.
- He's just being a joker.

15:11.044 --> 15:13.044
- You know, clown phobias
are a real thing.

15:13.046 --> 15:16.014
- It's true. And remember,
if you're ever attacked

15:16.016 --> 15:19.117
by a mob of clowns,
always go for the juggler.

15:22.389 --> 15:25.056
- Easy, brett.
Ignore these bozos.

15:25.058 --> 15:28.192
- Oh!
- Oh.

15:28.194 --> 15:30.295
Hey, dawson,
casey's looking for you.

15:35.068 --> 15:36.935
- Brett.
- Hey.

15:36.937 --> 15:39.437
- Um, I just want
to let you know

15:39.439 --> 15:41.105
I get the whole clown thing.

15:41.107 --> 15:43.608
My dad was
a professional clown,

15:43.610 --> 15:48.046
and my brother
could never handle it.

15:48.048 --> 15:50.048
Shoes were too big to fill.

15:50.050 --> 15:53.384
[laughter]

15:53.386 --> 15:56.220
come on, brett.
Give me--

15:56.222 --> 15:58.723
- hey, hey, guys,
check this out.

15:58.725 --> 16:01.392
"mr. Zvonecek, thank you
for your press release

16:01.394 --> 16:03.061
"regarding the anniversary
of molly's bar.

16:03.063 --> 16:05.997
We're going to assign a reporter
to cover the story."

16:05.999 --> 16:07.398
- oh!

16:07.400 --> 16:09.000
- Good for you, otis.
- Oh, my god.

16:09.002 --> 16:11.469
- I can't believe that worked.
What'd you tell them?

16:11.471 --> 16:13.604
- Well, I simply said
that a chicago institution

16:13.606 --> 16:16.207
of spirits and intoxicants
was celebrating 100 years

16:16.209 --> 16:18.343
of cheerful pours
and colorful conversation

16:18.345 --> 16:20.578
and I urged them
to write about it.

16:20.580 --> 16:22.680
- What's the catch?

16:22.682 --> 16:25.450
- There's no catch, hermy-herm.
It's free press.

16:25.452 --> 16:27.618
- Any press is good press.

16:27.620 --> 16:29.554
- Tell that to richard nixon.

16:29.556 --> 16:31.323
- We're going to need to up

16:31.324 --> 16:33.091
the budget on this shindig,
herrmann.

16:33.093 --> 16:35.660
Okay, we'll hand out
pre-prohibition cocktails

16:35.662 --> 16:37.695
as an enticement.
- Not a chance.

16:37.697 --> 16:39.330
- Hear me out.

16:39.332 --> 16:43.401
We'll restock the bar
with really rare chartreuse.

16:43.403 --> 16:47.171
Then the interior.

16:47.173 --> 16:50.308
- [sighs] doesn't matter
what it says on this form.

16:50.310 --> 16:52.276
As far as I'm concerned,
we're louie's parents

16:52.278 --> 16:53.478
as soon as the state
grants custody.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.613
- Yeah.

16:55.615 --> 16:57.749
But...I don't--

16:57.751 --> 17:01.619
I don't want us to be
mom and matt to louie.

17:01.621 --> 17:04.756
I want us to be mom and dad.

17:15.335 --> 17:19.237
- I want that more than
anything else in the world.

17:19.239 --> 17:23.207
So...How do we get that?

17:23.209 --> 17:26.077
- Well,
there's a family court judge

17:26.079 --> 17:28.613
I know through the youth center
committee, judge deaver.

17:28.615 --> 17:30.348
A straight shooter.

17:30.350 --> 17:33.451
I'll talk to him
about applying for co-adoption.

17:33.453 --> 17:36.521
At least see
what our options are.

17:36.523 --> 17:39.223
- Okay.
That's a good idea, baby.

17:39.225 --> 17:41.159
I mean, there's gotta be
exemptions, right?

17:41.161 --> 17:42.460
We can't be the first couple
who have done this.

17:42.462 --> 17:44.328
- No, no.

17:44.330 --> 17:47.131
There's an answer out there.

17:47.133 --> 17:49.267
We just have to find it.

18:09.789 --> 18:12.123
Hey!

18:14.527 --> 18:16.661
What do you want?

18:19.632 --> 18:22.767
[tires screeching]
[horn honking]

18:24.404 --> 18:26.671
- what the hell
was that all about?

18:26.673 --> 18:28.473
- I don't know.

18:28.475 --> 18:30.842
Saw him outside of my house
yesterday morning.

18:30.844 --> 18:32.376
Then here.

18:32.378 --> 18:33.711
- One of your constituents?

18:33.713 --> 18:36.814
- Your guess is as good
as mine.

18:42.755 --> 18:46.891
- Yeah, well, sadly, it looks
like you're gonna be fine.

18:46.893 --> 18:49.560
- You never told anyone at 51
you wanted to be a doctor.

18:49.562 --> 18:51.496
- I had three medical books
above my bunk.

18:51.498 --> 18:52.897
- Yeah, sure, buddy.

18:52.899 --> 18:55.233
- I did.

18:58.238 --> 19:00.238
Weird question.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.873
Are you in the bone marrow
registry?

19:01.875 --> 19:04.509
- Uh, they did a sign-up
in the academy,

19:04.511 --> 19:06.611
but I got dinged
'cause I had walking pneumonia.

19:06.613 --> 19:08.579
- You made a full recovery?

19:08.581 --> 19:10.781
- Yeah.
- Well, you're good to go.

19:10.783 --> 19:13.484
Let me send a nurse in here to
draw a blood sample real quick.

19:13.486 --> 19:15.720
- You know what? I'm about
to head out for furlough.

19:15.722 --> 19:16.921
Maybe in a couple of months?

19:16.923 --> 19:18.756
- Sure. That sounds good.
- Okay.

19:18.758 --> 19:21.325
Thanks, clarke.
Or is it doc now?

19:21.327 --> 19:23.694
- Clarke's good.
- Okay. Thanks.

19:23.696 --> 19:25.830
- See you, bud.

19:27.400 --> 19:30.701
- And marriage isn't really
an option right now

19:30.703 --> 19:32.236
for a bunch of family reasons

19:32.238 --> 19:33.838
that would take too long
to explain.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.406
- But you're living together?

19:35.408 --> 19:37.375
- Yes.
- For how long?

19:37.377 --> 19:39.810
- Not that long.

19:39.812 --> 19:41.279
- From what I know
about you, matt,

19:41.281 --> 19:42.847
you seem like a good guy.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.549
But the court
doesn't know either you

19:44.551 --> 19:46.184
or your girlfriend
from a turnip.

19:46.186 --> 19:48.053
- Well--
- what they do know

19:48.054 --> 19:49.921
is what they have on the papers
in front of them.

19:49.923 --> 19:53.958
Two single parents who just
started sharing the same roof.

19:53.960 --> 19:57.261
So co-adoption...

19:57.263 --> 19:59.397
It's a real long shot.

20:04.637 --> 20:06.437
- Beer through a straw?

20:06.439 --> 20:08.339
- I feel a cold sore
coming on.

20:08.341 --> 20:10.441
- Okay.

20:12.212 --> 20:15.780
Hey, hey, incoming.

20:15.782 --> 20:18.549
- Firefighters, huh?
- That's right.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.384
- You guys come here a lot?

20:20.386 --> 20:22.286
- Yeah, it's a firefighter bar.

20:22.288 --> 20:24.422
- It's dead.

20:25.625 --> 20:27.592
- Okay.

20:27.594 --> 20:29.427
- So, you're a firefighter too?

20:29.429 --> 20:30.795
- I am, yeah.

20:30.797 --> 20:34.465
- So, you want to get
out of here with us?

20:34.467 --> 20:36.567
Find something more fun.

20:41.641 --> 20:43.908
- Maybe another time.

20:43.910 --> 20:47.712
- Really?
- You sure? Last chance.

20:47.714 --> 20:49.847
- All good.
Have a safe night.

20:57.257 --> 20:58.789
- It was a generous portion,
but she finished it,

20:58.791 --> 21:02.593
no problem.
I think my mom would like her.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.528
- I'm looking for a brian.

21:04.530 --> 21:06.264
- Yeah, hi.
- Dee phillips.

21:06.266 --> 21:08.966
The "sun-times" culture section.
- Oh, yeah, great. Welcome.

21:08.968 --> 21:11.269
What can we get you to drink?
It's on the house, of course.

21:11.271 --> 21:12.903
- I can't.
Thank you.

21:12.905 --> 21:14.972
- Eh, come on. I'll make you
whatever your heart desires.

21:14.974 --> 21:17.041
- I don't drink.
Baptist.

21:17.043 --> 21:18.976
- What?

21:18.978 --> 21:20.878
Oh, okay.
Yeah, no problem.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.346
Uh, soda then?

21:22.348 --> 21:24.949
- Sodas are nothing
but chemicals and sugar.

21:24.951 --> 21:26.834
[laughter]

21:26.835 --> 21:28.718
um, I'm nearly finished
with my article, actually,

21:28.721 --> 21:30.955
but I wanted to get a quote
from you, brian.

21:30.957 --> 21:32.323
- Okay.

21:32.325 --> 21:33.991
- What do you think
about the gun violence

21:33.993 --> 21:37.061
currently consuming chicago?

21:37.063 --> 21:38.763
- The what now?

21:38.765 --> 21:42.366
- Do you condone it?

21:42.368 --> 21:43.734
- I think it's awful.

21:43.736 --> 21:45.002
Who would condone
something like that?

21:45.004 --> 21:46.037
- Then why is your bar

21:46.039 --> 21:48.039
celebrating
such a bloody history?

21:48.041 --> 21:50.808
One that includes
al capone.

21:50.810 --> 21:54.011
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Lady, what the hell is this?

21:54.013 --> 21:56.347
Hmm?

21:56.349 --> 21:57.982
- Okay, fine.
No comment.

21:57.984 --> 22:00.718
- We're just trying
to have a little party,

22:00.720 --> 22:02.887
and my business partner thought
it would be a good idea.

22:02.889 --> 22:06.757
- Hmm.
"a good idea."

22:06.759 --> 22:09.327
thank you so much
for your time.

22:09.329 --> 22:11.462
Look for my article
tomorrow.

22:15.001 --> 22:18.803
- Hey.
What was that about?

22:18.805 --> 22:22.707
- Yeah, otis,
what was that about?

22:22.709 --> 22:24.742
- No.
[groans]

22:24.744 --> 22:27.445
- what?

22:27.447 --> 22:31.582
- Wolcott pub massacre.

22:31.584 --> 22:33.718
- Oh.

22:36.456 --> 22:40.591
How much money are we into
on this party?

22:40.593 --> 22:42.727
- About 5 grand.

22:44.397 --> 22:46.530
- This place is cursed!

22:52.839 --> 22:55.873
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:55.875 --> 22:57.808
- Where's louie?
- He's sleeping.

22:57.810 --> 22:59.977
How'd it go?

23:02.849 --> 23:04.582
- Uh, I can give you guys
some alone time if you want.

23:04.584 --> 23:08.786
- No, no, no, no way.
Let's hear it.

23:08.788 --> 23:11.889
- Co-adoption ain't gonna
happen.

23:13.659 --> 23:14.658
- He said that?

23:14.660 --> 23:16.927
- He said the chances
were slim.

23:16.929 --> 23:21.031
We could fight it, but the court
isn't going to go for it.

23:21.033 --> 23:23.167
So you put your name down
as the adopter.

23:23.169 --> 23:26.036
I'll be louie's dad
in every sense of the word,

23:26.038 --> 23:30.608
no matter what's on that form
or whatever he calls me.

23:30.610 --> 23:32.843
- You sure?
- Yeah.

23:32.845 --> 23:35.679
The important thing is
louie's place here is permanent.

23:35.681 --> 23:37.815
- That's right.

23:42.455 --> 23:46.190
- I will get started
on the forms then.

23:46.192 --> 23:48.492
- And I will get
another bottle open.

23:53.833 --> 23:55.666
- See?

23:55.668 --> 23:57.768
There's always an answer.

24:08.948 --> 24:13.484
Hey, buddy.
Can't sleep, huh?

24:13.486 --> 24:16.720
Want me to read that
to you?

24:16.722 --> 24:18.856
Okay.

24:30.970 --> 24:33.103
[exhales deeply]

24:34.607 --> 24:36.740
hey.

24:39.178 --> 24:42.480
You know how much
I love you, right?

24:46.018 --> 24:49.153
You mean the world to me.

24:52.658 --> 24:56.594
And I think it's important
for you to know that

24:56.596 --> 25:00.731
no matter what
anybody ever says,

25:00.733 --> 25:04.902
or what anyone else
might call me,

25:04.904 --> 25:07.771
I will always...

25:07.773 --> 25:09.907
Always be your dad.

25:13.212 --> 25:15.513
That word means everything.

25:31.597 --> 25:32.696
- Tina.

25:32.698 --> 25:35.099
- Good to see you guys.

25:35.101 --> 25:37.535
- Here you go.

25:43.576 --> 25:45.242
Everything okay?

25:45.244 --> 25:46.744
- I wish I could tell
the court

25:46.746 --> 25:48.712
you were more stable
as a couple.

25:48.714 --> 25:51.849
- We're as stable as anyone
these days.

25:51.851 --> 25:53.918
- I'm sure.

25:53.920 --> 25:55.653
Well, I'll do what I can.

25:55.655 --> 25:57.087
Talk to you soon.

25:57.089 --> 25:59.189
- Okay.

26:02.295 --> 26:03.827
- Two hundred cases of--

26:03.829 --> 26:07.231
- "and what this anniversary
party says about chicago

26:07.233 --> 26:12.069
"is perhaps the saddest
epigram of all.

26:12.071 --> 26:14.238
"the city of broad shoulders

26:14.240 --> 26:19.276
is starting to reek
like a bloated corpse."

26:19.278 --> 26:20.911
- that's some vivid imagery.

26:20.913 --> 26:23.213
- Don't worry, no one knows
what an epigram is.

26:23.215 --> 26:25.749
- Yeah, and who reads
the culture section anyway?

26:25.751 --> 26:26.984
- Uh, people trying
