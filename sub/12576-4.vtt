HANK: Okay, Dale, hop on up.

00:48.058 --> 00:51.824
I don't know. Looks like
he died with his tongue sticking out.

00:52.029 --> 00:54.259
Let me try again. I can look deader.

00:54.331 --> 00:55.958
BOOMHAUER: No way, man. Dead is dead.

00:56.033 --> 00:58.297
It's getting old sitting up here
in this harness.

00:58.369 --> 01:00.530
Dang old wedgie city up here, man.

01:00.771 --> 01:03.296
HANK: Well, it's a small price
to pay, Boomhauer.

01:03.407 --> 01:06.240
I'm the general contractor
of the school's haunted house...

01:06.310 --> 01:09.768
and it's my responsibility
to bring this job in on time...

01:09.847 --> 01:12.008
under budget, and over scary.

01:12.182 --> 01:16.312
You know, it's the damnedest thing.
I got myself a wedgie, too.

01:17.221 --> 01:20.850
PEGGY: Hank, dinner time.
I am stirring in the cheese powder.

01:20.991 --> 01:21.980
HANK: Okay.

01:22.059 --> 01:25.620
Hey, Peg Leg! Can you come out here
and give me a hand?

01:26.163 --> 01:28.154
What is it, honey? I'm right in the middle...

PEGGY: Oh, you!

01:33.237 --> 01:35.705
That just took a year off of my life, I think.

01:35.773 --> 01:39.504
I'm gonna scare the pants off those kids,
I tell you what!

01:39.643 --> 01:42.441
I want Bobby
to have the perfect Halloween...

02:40.685 --> 02:43.381
they will punch out the nostril holes
for free.

Sorry. I got to go
to my youth fellowship meeting.

02:46.825 --> 02:49.293
We're gonna deliver
a hot meal to old people...

03:00.505 --> 03:02.029
BOBBY: They can bite you.

03:02.741 --> 03:06.199
And nine times out of ten,
they go right for the groin.

Where are the vampires
and monsters and ghosts?

our guest speaker.

03:21.292 --> 03:22.919
She's a new member of our church...

03:22.994 --> 03:25.622
who has made herself known
in a very short time...

03:25.697 --> 03:29.394
through a series of gutsy letters,
complaints, and threats.

Ms. Junie Harper.

[All clapping]

03:33.171 --> 03:34.433
Thank you.

03:34.572 --> 03:37.700
Why don't we just start things off
with a little quiz?

03:37.809 --> 03:39.674
I hope it's open Bible.

03:39.744 --> 03:42.235
Who can tell me what this is?

03:42.614 --> 03:43.876
LUANNE: It's a witch.

03:43.948 --> 03:45.813
Very good. What's your name?

03:45.917 --> 03:50.183
LUANNE: Luanne Platter.
JUNIE: Luanne. You answered that so fast.

03:50.655 --> 03:52.782
Do you know any witches yourself?

03:52.924 --> 03:55.722
LUANNE: Witches aren't real.
JUNIE: Yes, they are.

03:55.827 --> 03:57.488
They even have their own holiday.

03:57.562 --> 04:01.362
Who knows
what October holiday is associated...

04:01.499 --> 04:04.024
with witches, goblins, and Satanists?

LUANNE: Halloween?

04:16.314 --> 04:20.216
PEGGY: Well, we still need a costume
for Bobby. But at least we got our treats.

04:20.351 --> 04:24.151
Eat Wells, sugar-free, low-fat Fun Bars.

04:24.456 --> 04:28.051
Peggy, that stuff isn't for trick-or-treaters.
It's for diabetics.

04:28.293 --> 04:30.727
I'm not gonna gain 10 pounds
like I did last year.

04:30.795 --> 04:32.888
So, don't eat it. Just leave it there.

04:32.964 --> 04:35.899
No one said
you could touch my candy, anyway.

04:36.968 --> 04:39.266
JUNIE: The ancient Druids
celebrated Halloween...

04:39.337 --> 04:42.795
by eating babies by the light
of their jack-o'-lanterns.

04:43.208 --> 04:45.005
And then they danced.

Boy, I'm sure glad
your grandma kept my old costume!

that went along with this.

05:06.064 --> 05:07.929
It was disturbing.

05:08.032 --> 05:10.762
LUANNE: Uncle Hank, Aunt Peggy,
I have terrible news!

05:10.869 --> 05:14.498
Halloween is a satanic holiday.
It was invented by the Drewish!

05:14.672 --> 05:17.004
No, honey, not "Drewish." The Druids.

05:17.075 --> 05:19.202
Where did you hear that garbage?

05:19.310 --> 05:22.302
It's the truth.
Trick-or-treating is devil worship.

05:22.447 --> 05:23.971
Junie Harper says so.

05:24.215 --> 05:28.879
Luanne, Halloween is just good clean fun.
It's got nothing to do with the devil.

05:29.821 --> 05:32.415
HANK: I don't want to hear
any more of your foolishness.

05:32.490 --> 05:33.718
[Crying]

05:35.126 --> 05:37.151
Well, what is wrong with you?

05:37.362 --> 05:39.626
She put some exciting
new thing in her brain...

05:39.697 --> 05:42.530
and all she wanted to do was show it to us.

05:43.835 --> 05:45.928
[Making baby talk]

05:46.004 --> 05:48.564
So, you told him about the Druids,
and the candy corn...

05:48.640 --> 05:50.540
and he still thinks Halloween is just for fun.

05:51.042 --> 05:52.907
I felt so stupid.

05:52.977 --> 05:54.342
Oh, no.

05:54.412 --> 05:57.074
First of all, in the eyes of the Lord,
you're a genius.

05:57.148 --> 05:59.582
The devil fools you
into thinking you're stupid...

05:59.651 --> 06:02.711
because it makes it easier for him
to trick you.

06:02.854 --> 06:05.322
But if you think you're smart,
you can resist him.

06:05.390 --> 06:07.984
JUNIE: Do you see what I'm saying?
LUANNE: I'm not sure.

06:08.059 --> 06:10.493
JUNIE: Satan, be gone! Now you see?
LUANNE: Yes.

06:10.862 --> 06:13.592
These days, Satan's getting very popular.

06:13.731 --> 06:17.565
That's why, this Halloween,
I'm sponsoring a Hallelujah House.

06:17.669 --> 06:18.863
LUANNE: What's that?

06:18.937 --> 06:22.338
It's a righteous alternative
to those wicked haunted houses.

06:22.473 --> 06:23.906
Oh, no!

06:24.342 --> 06:27.675
Uncle Hank is running a haunted house,
down at Bobby's school.

06:27.879 --> 06:30.279
The school? Tell me more.

MOSS: Hello, Hank.

06:41.693 --> 06:44.924
This is a school.
You have to take that cigarette outside.

[Moss grunting]

06:52.870 --> 06:55.998
Hank, you know Mrs. Junie Harper.
She has some concerns.

06:56.207 --> 06:59.370
Apparently, some people
consider Halloween a religious holiday.

06:59.444 --> 07:00.433
HANK: So?

07:00.511 --> 07:05.175
So our Constitution guarantees
a separation of Church and state.

07:06.451 --> 07:09.579
Mrs. Harper has a point, and an attorney.

07:10.488 --> 07:11.819
JUNIE: What's the skeleton for?

07:11.889 --> 07:14.255
Planning to read fortunes
with the casting of bones?

07:14.325 --> 07:15.314
No.

07:15.393 --> 07:17.486
And what's that, a witch?

07:17.695 --> 07:18.957
That has got to go.

07:19.030 --> 07:21.089
I'm not taking out any of this stuff.

07:21.165 --> 07:24.532
I want those kids
to have a real scary Halloween.

07:24.769 --> 07:26.669
You know, I'm starting to feel...

07:26.738 --> 07:30.003
like the whole idea
of a house of horrors is wrong.

07:30.408 --> 07:33.138
Or we could make it a house of pancakes.

07:35.680 --> 07:38.774
BILL: I'm just brainstorming here.
HANK: Shut up, Bill.

07:39.050 --> 07:42.281
Look, we either do this haunted house
the right way...

07:42.353 --> 07:45.481
or I'm not doing it at all.
Now, what's it gonna be?

07:45.556 --> 07:47.649
Hank, we can't afford another lawsuit.

07:47.725 --> 07:51.593
We blew our budget fighting wheelchair
ramps and left-handed scissors.

07:51.729 --> 07:53.526
So that's how it is?

07:53.731 --> 07:55.722
Boomhauer, grab Hagatha.

07:55.933 --> 07:58.731
There's only room for one witch in here.

It's our last Halloween together,
and Junie Harper ruined it.

08:19.457 --> 08:23.689
PEGGY: There's nothing in the Constitution
about separation of Church and garage.

08:23.861 --> 08:26.159
Why don't you make a haunted garage?

08:26.297 --> 08:28.094
Yeah, I guess I could do that.

08:28.166 --> 08:31.397
No, Uncle Hank. You could go to hell.

08:31.703 --> 08:35.503
See, Junie Harper says a haunted house
is the devil's mousetrap...

08:35.707 --> 08:37.572
and fun is the cheese.

08:37.674 --> 08:42.442
Luanne, just when I think you've said
the stupidest thing ever, you keep talking.

08:42.679 --> 08:46.013
Junie says I'm smart, so don't try
to trick me into thinking I'm not.

08:46.084 --> 08:48.917
Now, hold on. Luanne is not stupid.

08:49.153 --> 08:51.644
And neither is Hank's idea
for a haunted house.

08:51.723 --> 08:54.817
So, you can have your haunted garage,
and you can be smart.

08:54.892 --> 08:58.293
LUANNE: But Junie Harper says...
HANK: "Junie Harper says..."

08:58.429 --> 08:59.726
Last time I checked...

08:59.797 --> 09:03.028
it wasn't Junie Harper's face

[Exclaiming]

09:06.504 --> 09:10.565
Bobby, next Halloween you're gonna be
too old to dress up and get candy.

09:10.875 --> 09:11.864
What?

09:11.943 --> 09:15.936
Now, don't panic.
Treats are only half of trick-or-treat.

09:16.381 --> 09:19.441
It's time you learn to give
as well as receive.

09:19.751 --> 09:21.844
You're not gonna throw that, are you?

09:21.919 --> 09:23.819
Bobby! Of course I am.

09:24.055 --> 09:25.920
It's a sign of respect.

You know who could use
a little respect right now? Dale.

Kitty! Joshua!

"Do unto others..."

09:45.015 --> 09:46.243
BOBBY: I don't know, Dad.

09:46.316 --> 09:49.979
This is vandalism, and vandalism isn't cool.

09:50.087 --> 09:53.022
Bobby, that attitude is a little immature.

09:53.657 --> 09:55.124
Now, come on.

a little visit tonight?

BOBBY: Yes.
PEGGY: Bobby!

11:05.529 --> 11:09.465
Now, don't jump all over the boy.
The truth is, this is my fault.

11:09.566 --> 11:10.965
JUNIE: Well, of course it is.

11:11.034 --> 11:13.059
His antisocial behavior is a result...

11:13.136 --> 11:15.900
of your whole family's
anti-Christian values.

and bingoed and bake-saled my way...

11:24.514 --> 11:26.106
as close to the good Lord as you.

11:26.183 --> 11:29.346
So, do not try to one-up me,
because I will one-up yours.

11:29.419 --> 11:33.150
"The complacency of fools
will destroy them." Proverbs.

11:33.423 --> 11:36.153
"Get out of my house." Exodus.

11:37.928 --> 11:41.830
HANK: You're a regular Halloween
hell-raiser, just like your old man.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.024
[Door opens]

11:44.101 --> 11:46.501
And I'm very disappointed in you.

11:46.903 --> 11:47.892
[Peggy agrees]

11:58.849 --> 12:00.339
[Hank laughing]

12:01.818 --> 12:03.183
[Chirping]

12:04.755 --> 12:08.282
I'll never use toilet paper in anger again.

12:09.092 --> 12:11.492
LUANNE: Are you all right?
I didn't hear the TV on.

12:11.561 --> 12:12.994
I grounded myself.

12:13.196 --> 12:16.632
I don't deserve to watch TV
after what I did last night.

12:16.733 --> 12:20.032
LUANNE: It's not your fault.
It's Uncle Hank's fault.

12:20.937 --> 12:22.131
[Luanne sighing]

12:22.205 --> 12:23.866
He's a Satanist, Bobby.

12:24.041 --> 12:27.169
Come on, Luanne!
That's the craziest thing I ever heard.

12:27.277 --> 12:29.074
LUANNE: It's true.
BOBBY: Oh, dang!

12:29.279 --> 12:32.680
That's why Uncle Hank
smirched my ideas about Halloween.

12:32.816 --> 12:35.341
The devil doesn't want you
to know the truth.

12:35.686 --> 12:38.177
Did your father ever make you drink blood?

12:38.355 --> 12:40.050
He made me eat liver once.

12:40.123 --> 12:42.250
That is called a recovered memory.

12:42.659 --> 12:45.389
Think, Bobby.
What else can you remember?

12:45.729 --> 12:46.718
[Grunts]

12:46.863 --> 12:50.094
Where are the vampires
and monsters and ghosts?

12:50.300 --> 12:54.361
You're a regular Halloween hell-raiser,
just like your old man.

12:54.538 --> 12:57.336
It's just liver. It's not gonna kill you.

12:57.441 --> 12:59.306
[Sinister laughing]

13:01.244 --> 13:02.506
Oh, dang!

13:03.780 --> 13:05.805
DALE: The vandalism upon my house...

13:05.882 --> 13:08.510
can only be described as a hate crime.

13:09.052 --> 13:10.644
Somebody hates me.

13:10.754 --> 13:13.723
Let the record show
that somebody hates Dale Dribble.

13:13.790 --> 13:18.022
Last night, my house
was also attacked by Satanists.

13:18.595 --> 13:20.859
Mrs. Harper,
what evidence do you have of that?

13:20.931 --> 13:22.592
What evidence?

13:22.999 --> 13:25.229
How is this for evidence?

13:25.502 --> 13:27.231
[All groaning]

13:27.571 --> 13:28.799
Little kitty!

13:29.172 --> 13:30.969
Well, I think it is perfect.

13:31.108 --> 13:34.271
Although I still think "Hank Heck"
works just as well.

13:34.544 --> 13:36.774
Yes! Halloween is canceled.

13:37.080 --> 13:39.571
I just got off the phone
with Mrs. Junie Harper.

13:39.649 --> 13:42.083
She said that the city council
passed a curfew...

13:42.152 --> 13:44.518
because the Satanists
made her run over her cat.

13:44.588 --> 13:46.283
What about the trick-or-treaters?

13:46.356 --> 13:48.586
There won't be any trick-or-treaters.

13:48.692 --> 13:49.750
See, Uncle Hank?

13:49.826 --> 13:53.262
You said I was wrong,
but now everyone agrees with me.

13:53.363 --> 13:56.821
Nobody agrees with you.
You agree with everybody else.

13:57.134 --> 13:59.625
You agree with any idiot
who says anything.

13:59.770 --> 14:01.362
Stop attacking her, Hank.

14:01.438 --> 14:04.407
Luanne didn't cancel Halloween.
Junie Harper did.

14:04.508 --> 14:06.100
I don't care what she does.

14:06.176 --> 14:08.337
Tomorrow night, I'm gonna teach Bobby...

14:08.411 --> 14:11.778
the true meaning of Halloween,
come hell or high water.

14:13.350 --> 14:16.342
My dad sure wants me to be
at that haunted house.

14:16.520 --> 14:19.284
Last time he wanted me
to be somewhere so bad...

14:19.356 --> 14:21.381
I woke up without tonsils.

14:22.392 --> 14:23.416
[Luanne exclaiming]

14:23.493 --> 14:26.189
This time, he may be after your soul.

14:26.530 --> 14:28.259
I'm scared, Luanne.

14:28.598 --> 14:30.566
I can't help you, Bobby.

14:30.934 --> 14:32.595
But I know who can.

14:32.769 --> 14:34.168
[Religious instrumental music]

14:34.237 --> 14:35.898
Mrs. Junie Harper.

14:40.277 --> 14:41.505
[Gate creaking]

14:41.578 --> 14:42.806
[Wind howling]

14:47.918 --> 14:49.647
[Crickets chirping]

14:56.626 --> 14:58.253
Thanks for helping me get away.

14:58.328 --> 15:02.230
I heard Satanists like my dad
always sacrifice virgins.

15:02.599 --> 15:05.033
So we'd both better be careful.

15:05.502 --> 15:06.764
[Hemming]

15:06.837 --> 15:07.895
[Car door shuts]

15:13.476 --> 15:14.738
Where is everybody?

15:14.811 --> 15:18.144
I can't believe they're staying home
because of a curfew.

15:18.281 --> 15:19.908
And where the heck is Bobby?

15:19.983 --> 15:21.507
He's still out with Luanne.

15:21.585 --> 15:23.780
I sent them to the store for more Hi-C.

15:23.854 --> 15:26.550
Now, I guess that was a fool's errand.

15:30.160 --> 15:34.597
Isn't there one person in this town
with the courage to celebrate Halloween?

15:34.664 --> 15:37.963
DALE: [On megaphone] Hank,
while you're out there, turn off my hose.

15:38.835 --> 15:42.362
First of all, I'd like to say
"halo" to everybody.

15:42.939 --> 15:45.339
Now, follow me, children. No pushing.

15:45.442 --> 15:47.774
"He who is last shall be first."

15:51.514 --> 15:52.981
JUNIE: What have we here?

15:53.183 --> 15:56.846
It's a young, unmarried couple,
who are about to let their hormones...

15:56.920 --> 15:58.717
get the best of them.

15:58.889 --> 16:00.789
[Organ music playing on speakers]

16:00.857 --> 16:01.881
[Junie exclaims]

16:01.958 --> 16:06.054
I guess the old saying is true: "Sex kills."

16:10.533 --> 16:12.694
Dinner's ready. Where's Grandpa?

16:12.802 --> 16:14.702
[Grunting]

16:15.472 --> 16:16.803
[Junie screaming]

16:16.940 --> 16:19.033
That's your grandpa?

16:19.209 --> 16:22.144
Haven't you heard?
Our ancestors are monkeys.

16:23.580 --> 16:24.774
[Gorilla growls]

16:24.848 --> 16:27.942
WOMAN: [Monotonically] Oh, no!
He's eating the baby. Stop him!

16:28.084 --> 16:29.779
WOMAN: Honey?
MAN: We can't.

16:30.153 --> 16:32.747
It's against the law to teach creationism.

16:32.822 --> 16:34.119
[Children gasping]

16:35.325 --> 16:36.622
Have you seen Bobby?

16:37.060 --> 16:38.288
[Hemming]

16:38.495 --> 16:40.156
I think he said...

16:40.430 --> 16:42.990
he was going to the gym.

16:43.199 --> 16:44.188
Luanne.

16:44.301 --> 16:48.465
All right, I took him to Junie Harper's.
He's a lot better off there.

16:48.538 --> 16:50.005
What are you talking about?

16:50.073 --> 16:54.703
Well, I think that it's better for a child
to receive wholesome impressions...

16:54.778 --> 16:57.338
from established religious authorities...

16:57.547 --> 17:00.778
than participate in rituals
that are conducted by people...

17:00.850 --> 17:03.648
who don't know
they are pawns of the devil.

17:03.720 --> 17:08.054
Little missy, you hold it right there.
I have had it up to here with your baloney.

17:08.124 --> 17:11.287
I have taken you into my home,
I have sheltered and fed you.

17:11.361 --> 17:13.420
If you step
between my husband and his son...

17:13.496 --> 17:15.964
I will cast you out like yesterday's garbage.

17:16.031 --> 17:18.227
But I...

17:18.435 --> 17:20.665
From now on,
you leave the parenting to us.

17:20.737 --> 17:22.829
We get a magazine about it.

17:26.076 --> 17:29.068
PEGGY: I brought you an ice-cold beer.
HANK: Thanks, Peggy.

17:30.246 --> 17:34.410
Luanne took Bobby to Junie Harper's
for an anti-Halloween church party.

17:34.484 --> 17:35.473
[Choking]

17:35.552 --> 17:36.814
[Gulping]

17:37.620 --> 17:40.248
I came very close to spitting out beer.

17:40.423 --> 17:41.927
I knew you'd be upset.

17:43.162 --> 17:45.494
They wrecked my haunted house,
they outlawed my trick-or-treating...

17:45.564 --> 17:47.794
and now they want to brainwash my boy?

17:47.867 --> 17:50.563
It's time for somebody to do something.

17:51.404 --> 17:52.928
[Police-radio chattering]

17:56.475 --> 17:58.773
Hank, no! You could go to jail.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.911
I knew the risks when I put on the uniform.

18:06.619 --> 18:08.917
HANK: [Repeatedly] Trick or treat!

18:25.371 --> 18:28.636
Hey, man! Check it out, man.
I don't need no dang old costume, man.

18:28.708 --> 18:32.508
I can be a dang old mime,
'cause I'm trying to get out of his box.

18:32.578 --> 18:34.808
I say, playing tug of war, man.

18:35.614 --> 18:37.138
BOTH: Trick or treat!

18:39.118 --> 18:40.710

ALL: [Repeatedly] Trick or treat!

18:52.131 --> 18:53.120
DALE: Boo.

18:53.332 --> 18:57.860
I am a high-priced Washington lobbyist,
peddling influence.

ALL: [Repeatedly] Trick or treat!

19:30.736 --> 19:35.435
Okay, Susie, what's it gonna take to get
you to join the Hallelujah Club tonight?

19:37.209 --> 19:41.111
Look, you took the brownie.
I didn't make you take the brownie.

19:42.982 --> 19:45.246
JUNIE: Congratulations, Bobby.

19:45.584 --> 19:47.415
Hey, everybody, listen up!

19:47.553 --> 19:50.386
Bobby Hill has joined the Hallelujah Club.

19:50.489 --> 19:52.684

19:53.058 --> 19:54.787
Can I have another brownie?

19:57.363 --> 19:58.352
[Muttering]

19:58.831 --> 20:00.196
I'll handle this.

20:00.266 --> 20:01.961
CROWD: Trick or treat!

20:02.635 --> 20:05.365
HANK: Hey, Bobby.
BOBBY: Go away, Satan.

20:05.437 --> 20:07.200
Bobby, it's just a costume.

20:07.273 --> 20:09.264
There is a curfew in effect, Mr. Hill.

20:09.341 --> 20:12.310
But I guess you have no respect
for man's law, either.

20:12.378 --> 20:14.778
I've had enough of this nonsense.

20:15.014 --> 20:17.209
Come on, son, let's go trick-or-treating.

20:17.416 --> 20:20.681
He will not, because he is a good boy.

20:22.721 --> 20:23.745
[Sighing]

20:23.823 --> 20:27.259
All right, Bobby.
I don't want to force you to choose.

20:27.493 --> 20:30.428
I just wanted to spend Halloween
with my son...

20:30.496 --> 20:32.987
but I guess I can't do that this year.

20:33.065 --> 20:35.158
It just tears my heart out.

20:35.467 --> 20:37.298
[Screaming in anguish]

[Kids laughing]

JUNIE: What do you think you're doing?
HANK: Just keeping an eye out for my son.

20:45.544 --> 20:47.671
Oh, mercy! What have I done?

20:48.581 --> 20:51.482
Do not encourage this monster. This is vile!

20:51.684 --> 20:54.983
Come on, Bobby!
Halloween is just no fun without you.

20:56.622 --> 21:00.615
Bobby, if you leave now,
you'll never get the key to the kingdom.

21:00.793 --> 21:02.852
HANK: Come on, son. Let's get some candy.

21:02.928 --> 21:05.158
JUNIE: You'll go to hell!
HANK: You'll get candy.

21:05.231 --> 21:06.459
JUNIE: Hell!
HANK: Candy!

21:07.199 --> 21:09.861
Stop! I don't care about candy.

21:11.003 --> 21:12.027
[Scoffing victoriously]

21:24.617 --> 21:27.108
Fine! Go on, all of you!

21:27.253 --> 21:29.744
More room in heaven for me!

21:30.356 --> 21:33.519
We got to get you home
and scare you up a costume.

21:33.826 --> 21:35.817
HANK: Okay. Hey, Dad?

21:36.061 --> 21:39.519
I was just kidding before.
I care about candy.

21:39.965 --> 21:41.364
I care a lot.
