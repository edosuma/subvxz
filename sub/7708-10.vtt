WEBVTT

00:01.435 --> 00:04.470
Hey, Willie, when does
the band get here?

00:04.472 --> 00:06.672
No band, ALF.

00:06.674 --> 00:09.975
Well then, who's gonna
back up the dancing poodles?

00:11.212 --> 00:14.113
There are no dancing poodles.

00:14.115 --> 00:17.316
Yeah, there are.
I saw them on "Letterman."

00:17.318 --> 00:19.752
They dance pretty
good for white dogs.

00:21.722 --> 00:23.155
No poodles, ALF.

00:23.157 --> 00:24.723
And next time, I'll thank you

00:24.725 --> 00:27.092
not to order dancing dogs

00:27.094 --> 00:29.328
without asking me first.

00:29.330 --> 00:30.829
Okay.

00:30.831 --> 00:33.532
So, when do all
the guests arrive?

00:33.534 --> 00:35.667
Neal? He'll be here soon.

00:35.669 --> 00:38.203
He just had to stop
off for a bottle of wine.

00:38.205 --> 00:41.440
So, my third anniversary
of landing on your planet

00:41.442 --> 00:42.775
is gonna be just another day

00:42.777 --> 00:45.310
except for toilet
paper on the ceiling

00:45.312 --> 00:47.579
and a piece of dry cake.

00:47.581 --> 00:51.517
Gee, guys.
I'm all misty.

00:51.519 --> 00:54.686
ALF, we're trying to make
this as special as we can, huh?

00:54.688 --> 00:57.656
By the way,
this isn't toilet paper.

00:57.658 --> 00:59.591
Well, it does the job

00:59.593 --> 01:01.660
although it chafes.

01:02.563 --> 01:03.829
[telephone ringing]

01:03.831 --> 01:05.064
I'll get it.

01:05.066 --> 01:07.366
Here, ALF. Does this look
like your spaceship?

01:07.368 --> 01:08.634
(Kate)
'Hello?'

01:08.636 --> 01:09.935
Well, you forgot
the bumper sticker.

01:09.937 --> 01:12.838
"My other spaceship
is a Porsche."

01:12.840 --> 01:15.174
Other than that, it's a
pretty feeble attempt.

01:15.176 --> 01:18.277
Ah. Calm down, mom.
I can hardly hear you.

01:18.279 --> 01:20.779
Where are you?

01:20.781 --> 01:22.347
The airport?

01:22.349 --> 01:25.084
Don't invite her!
Don't invite her!

01:26.454 --> 01:27.986
What's wrong?

01:29.090 --> 01:30.255
Oh..

01:30.257 --> 01:31.957
Oh, n.. No, no.

01:31.959 --> 01:35.027
Stay right where you are.
I'm on my way.

01:35.029 --> 01:38.297
I thought you said we
couldn't have a dancing dog?

01:38.299 --> 01:40.532
- ALF.
- You're right.

01:40.534 --> 01:44.036
Who am I to assume
she knows how to dance?

01:44.038 --> 01:46.205
What happened to grandma?

01:46.207 --> 01:48.240
Mom and Whizzer had a fight.

01:48.242 --> 01:51.710
She left him.
I gotta go pick her up.

01:51.712 --> 01:54.146
What, is her thumb broken?

01:54.982 --> 01:56.982
[theme music]

02:56.243 --> 02:57.943
[instrumental music]

02:59.980 --> 03:03.248
Okay, okay, uh, we've got
a clock and a bird.

03:03.250 --> 03:04.416
- Uh-huh.
- Bird-watch!

03:04.418 --> 03:07.486
- Uh-unh!
- Uh, uh, bird-watching!

03:07.488 --> 03:10.389
- That's it, let's eat.
- Uh-unh!

03:10.391 --> 03:12.524
Are you sure?

03:12.526 --> 03:14.626
Watch. Bird.

03:16.297 --> 03:18.163
Watch-bird.

03:21.669 --> 03:25.070
One flew over the cuckoo's nest!

03:25.072 --> 03:26.638
Ugh!

03:28.409 --> 03:31.076
That's my final answer.
Make it work.

03:33.047 --> 03:34.680
Oh, come on!

03:34.682 --> 03:37.216
What else could it be?

03:37.218 --> 03:38.217
[timer dings]

03:38.219 --> 03:42.020
What about "time flies?"

03:42.022 --> 03:45.090
What about a
halfway decent clue?

03:49.096 --> 03:50.262
Are you having fun, ALF?

03:50.264 --> 03:51.830
Yeah. Great party.

03:51.832 --> 03:54.800
Considering you guys
wouldn't let me have helium.

03:56.203 --> 03:58.804
Ah.. Oh, aha.

03:58.806 --> 04:01.840
I believe I smell a victory.

04:01.842 --> 04:04.076
- Ready?
- Uh, yeah.

04:04.078 --> 04:06.044
Go.

04:06.046 --> 04:07.980
(Brian)
'Okay.'

04:07.982 --> 04:09.014
West!

04:09.016 --> 04:10.916
West..

04:10.918 --> 04:12.017
Z..

04:12.019 --> 04:13.151
Sleep?

04:13.153 --> 04:14.453
Quiet.

04:14.455 --> 04:15.954
"All Quiet
On The Western Front!"

04:15.956 --> 04:17.723
That's it.

04:17.725 --> 04:19.658
Boy, way to go.

04:19.660 --> 04:22.327
How come they always
get the easy ones?

04:23.697 --> 04:26.164
"Time flies?"

04:26.166 --> 04:27.899
[doorbell rings]

04:28.736 --> 04:31.203
Oh, boy! The guest has arrived.

04:35.676 --> 04:37.576
What on earth?

04:37.578 --> 04:39.177
Hi, Willie.

04:39.179 --> 04:40.445
Hi, everyone.

04:40.447 --> 04:41.813
Hi, ALF.

04:41.815 --> 04:43.615
Happy anniversary.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.517
Hi, Uncle Neal.

04:45.519 --> 04:46.918
Hi, Uncle Neal.

04:46.920 --> 04:49.421
Why are you dressed like a bed?

04:49.423 --> 04:53.158
ALF said it was a toga party.

04:53.160 --> 04:56.662
Shoot! That was the call
I was supposed to make.

04:58.065 --> 05:01.600
I'll, uh, I'll get you
something to put on.

05:01.602 --> 05:03.669
Or we could all wear sheets!

05:03.671 --> 05:07.606
Lynn? To-ga! To-ga! To-ga!

05:07.608 --> 05:10.876
Fat chance,
fat chance, fat chance.

05:11.745 --> 05:13.779
So where are the dogs?

05:17.318 --> 05:19.785
They're at the airport.

05:19.787 --> 05:21.820
I heard that.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.355
He's upset because
Kate went to the airport

05:23.357 --> 05:25.057
to pick up her mother,
and he's afraid

05:25.059 --> 05:26.758
that she's gonna
spoil his party.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.927
Oh. What brings Dorothy to town?

05:28.929 --> 05:32.264
Oh, she and Whizzer
had another fight.

05:32.266 --> 05:33.832
She flew out by herself.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.934
Aw, that's a shame.

05:35.936 --> 05:39.371
Another marriage
flapping in shallow water.

05:39.373 --> 05:42.240
That's how I felt when
Margaret dumped me.

05:42.242 --> 05:46.678
Oh, great. My party's turning
into a suicide watch.

05:48.782 --> 05:50.982
[instrumental music]

05:56.323 --> 06:00.592
Everything I own in the world
is in those suitcases.

06:00.594 --> 06:02.561
Mrs. Deaver,
we're very, very sorry

06:02.563 --> 06:03.862
about any inconvenience.

06:03.864 --> 06:05.364
If they are not
on the next plane

06:05.366 --> 06:06.598
we will have them delivered

06:06.600 --> 06:08.600
as soon as we can locate them.

06:08.602 --> 06:10.068
Please accept this coupon

06:10.070 --> 06:12.604

drink plus earphones

06:12.606 --> 06:14.272
on your next
international flight

06:14.274 --> 06:16.875
some restrictions apply.

06:16.877 --> 06:17.909
Listen, young man.

06:17.911 --> 06:19.277
This is not the first time

06:19.279 --> 06:20.679
I have gone through
this on your airline.

06:20.681 --> 06:23.515
Okay. Look.
Alright, I confess.

06:23.517 --> 06:24.983
I took your bags.

06:24.985 --> 06:26.651
I was behind you on
the counter in St. Louis.

06:26.653 --> 06:30.155
I said to myself, "Whoo, this
lady must have pretty things"

06:30.157 --> 06:33.125
is that what you want to hear?

06:33.127 --> 06:35.827
Well, there's no
need to get nasty.

06:35.829 --> 06:39.164
I'll check one more time,
because I care.

06:39.166 --> 06:41.867
Have a seat.

06:41.869 --> 06:43.735
Smart aleck.

06:44.838 --> 06:46.138
[sighs]
Mom.

06:46.140 --> 06:48.907
Oh, Kate! Oh,
it's so good to see you.

06:48.909 --> 06:51.843
I have been looking
all over for you.

06:51.845 --> 06:52.844
What happened?

06:52.846 --> 06:54.980
Oh, it was awful.

06:54.982 --> 06:57.482
I did roadside
check-in in St. Louis.

06:57.484 --> 06:59.151
Never do that. Always
take your bags straight..

06:59.153 --> 07:03.755
Mom, mom. I was talking
about you and Whizzer.

07:03.757 --> 07:05.457
Look, I don't want
to talk about it.

07:05.459 --> 07:07.793
I have more important
things on my mind.

07:07.795 --> 07:11.430
Okay, here. Come here.
Come here. Sit down.

07:11.432 --> 07:13.865
Mom, you can replace luggage.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.801
You can't replace a husband.

07:15.803 --> 07:18.170
That depends on the luggage.

07:18.172 --> 07:20.038
Mom. Whizzer?

07:20.040 --> 07:23.008
He's dead. How's the baby?

07:23.010 --> 07:25.076
You flew 2,000 miles,
you call me in a panic

07:25.078 --> 07:28.480
you don't want
to discuss it, fine.

07:28.482 --> 07:30.982
He doesn't give a damn about me.

07:30.984 --> 07:33.852
All he cares about
is jazz, jazz, jazz.

07:33.854 --> 07:36.488
The man is a
cultural cul-de-sac.

07:36.490 --> 07:37.722
Do you know what it is like

07:37.724 --> 07:39.224
trying to reason with someone

07:39.226 --> 07:41.493
while he's draining
his spit valve?

07:43.530 --> 07:48.133
Mom, you knew a spit valve
came with the marriage.

07:48.135 --> 07:50.168
But I didn't know
my home would end up

07:50.170 --> 07:52.804
being a storage locker in L.A.

07:52.806 --> 07:56.441
All I asked from him was
to give up his lifestyle

07:56.443 --> 08:01.313
and stay in one place.
Here. He said no.

08:01.315 --> 08:05.183
So, I suggested a new place to
store his saxophone and left.

08:06.887 --> 08:09.187
Mom, you knew how important

08:09.189 --> 08:10.755
being on the road
was to Whizzer.

08:10.757 --> 08:13.692
Now, is it possible
that you're not being

08:13.694 --> 08:16.261
totally sensitive
to his feelings?

08:16.263 --> 08:20.565
Kate, that is not fair.
I'm a very sensitive person.

08:20.567 --> 08:23.034
I'm sorry.

08:23.036 --> 08:25.971
Now, where's
rain man with my bags?

08:27.808 --> 08:29.407
What?

08:32.613 --> 08:34.613
Alright! Come on,
I'm on a roll.

08:34.615 --> 08:36.781
Hit me with another one.

08:36.783 --> 08:39.351
Um, okay.

08:39.353 --> 08:40.552
Okay.

08:40.554 --> 08:41.987
Okay.

- I know.

08:53.100 --> 08:55.433
Come on, come on, I'm hot.

08:55.435 --> 08:58.603
Alright, alright, here it goes.
Here's one. Uh..

09:07.581 --> 09:10.148
- Next! Huh.
- Okay.

09:10.150 --> 09:11.783
H-here's one you don't know.

09:11.785 --> 09:14.419
Oh. Uh..

to "Fiddler On The Roof."

09:25.899 --> 09:27.933
Next.

09:27.935 --> 09:29.734
Can we play something else?

09:29.736 --> 09:31.937
Something maybe
we can all take part in?

09:31.939 --> 09:34.739
No! Next!

09:34.741 --> 09:37.876
Brian, uh, is it past, uh

09:37.878 --> 09:40.245
certain somebody's bed time?

09:40.247 --> 09:42.514
You want us to wake you when
grandma Dorothy gets here?

09:42.516 --> 09:44.349
Only if she brought me
something.

09:44.351 --> 09:46.952
If not, tell her I'll see her
in the morning.

09:48.689 --> 09:51.156
[telephone ringing]

09:51.858 --> 09:52.891
Hello?

09:52.893 --> 09:54.859
Oh, hi, honey. Where are you?

09:54.861 --> 09:57.596
What? Well.. W-what happened?

09:57.598 --> 10:01.299
Oh, don't tell me.
She's been taken hostage.

10:01.301 --> 10:03.935
I say no deals.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.503
They're still at the airport.
They..

10:05.505 --> 10:08.607
Th-they lost
Dorothy's suitcases.

10:08.609 --> 10:10.475
Too bad they didn't lose her.

10:11.912 --> 10:14.312
I can't get the two of them
don't get along.

10:14.314 --> 10:15.981
Oh, they've had their moments.

10:15.983 --> 10:17.882
Luckily, one of us
is always been around

10:17.884 --> 10:19.451
to turn the hose on them.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.121
Well, tell her we say "hi."

10:24.257 --> 10:26.191
Fun?

10:26.193 --> 10:28.326
I wouldn't say fun.

10:29.730 --> 10:31.129
Hurry home, though.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.031
We'll save you some cake.

10:34.501 --> 10:35.800
[doorbell rings]

10:35.802 --> 10:38.003
Wait, don't tell me!

10:38.005 --> 10:41.473
You got me my dancing
poodles after all!

10:41.475 --> 10:43.742
Oh, I shouldn't
have said anything.

10:43.744 --> 10:46.678
I spoiled the surprise.

10:46.680 --> 10:48.146
Get in the kitchen.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.548
Oh, you're really
gonna milk this, huh?

10:50.550 --> 10:53.885
Okay. I'll try to
look surprised.

10:53.887 --> 10:56.021
How's this?

11:00.927 --> 11:03.628
Well, it's Whizzer!

11:03.630 --> 11:04.729
Whizzer!

11:04.731 --> 11:06.698
Hi, Willie.
Is Dorothy here?

11:06.700 --> 11:09.367
No, Kate just went to
pick her up at the airport.

11:09.369 --> 11:11.036
I must have just missed them.

11:11.038 --> 11:12.170
Hi, Neal. Hi, Lynn.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.606
- Hi, Whizzer.
- Hi, Whizzer.

11:14.608 --> 11:15.807
I guess you heard.

11:15.809 --> 11:17.575
About your fight with Dorothy?

11:17.577 --> 11:19.310
The woman is impossible.

11:19.312 --> 11:21.479
Nothing I do seems
to please her.

11:21.481 --> 11:23.248
I'm telling you, this thing
has got me so worked up

11:23.250 --> 11:25.050
I don't know what to do anymore.

11:25.052 --> 11:26.584
I would have called, but..

11:26.586 --> 11:29.287
I've been a bundle of raw
nerves ever since the argument.

11:29.289 --> 11:31.056
It's all I can do,
is to keep myself

11:31.058 --> 11:33.625
from losing it altogether.

11:33.627 --> 11:35.026
- I need a beer.
- No!

11:35.028 --> 11:39.130
Relax! I'll leave a buck on
the counter, you cheapskate!

11:39.132 --> 11:41.733
Oh, I'm sorry.

11:41.735 --> 11:43.802
See what I mean?

11:43.804 --> 11:45.904
S-stop!

11:45.906 --> 11:48.106
[screaming]

11:48.108 --> 11:49.774
(ALF)
'Arf, arf.'

11:49.776 --> 11:51.676
'Would you believe "meow?"'

11:51.678 --> 11:53.678
[instrumental music]

11:58.018 --> 12:00.385
[instrumental music]

12:03.023 --> 12:04.723
How's your headache, Whizzer?

12:04.725 --> 12:06.491
It's getting better.

12:06.493 --> 12:08.159
You know, I always thought
that "hitting the ceiling"

12:08.161 --> 12:10.361
was just an expression.

12:10.363 --> 12:12.397
Does he, uh, levitate,
or cure people

12:12.399 --> 12:14.532
by touching them, or anything?

12:14.534 --> 12:18.203
You kidding?
Can't even make his own bed.

12:19.506 --> 12:21.306
I can so!

12:21.308 --> 12:23.842
I just don't want to.

12:23.844 --> 12:26.811
You know, I've played a lot of
clubs over the year, but, uh

12:26.813 --> 12:29.981
you're the third strangest
things I've ever seen.

12:29.983 --> 12:32.684
Really? Does that include Kate?

12:33.987 --> 12:37.122
[sighs]
Here you go, Whizzer.
Drink this.

12:37.124 --> 12:39.791
Your pupils are dilating nicely.

12:39.793 --> 12:41.893
Thank you.

12:41.895 --> 12:43.595
So, ALF, uh..

12:43.597 --> 12:45.764
What have you done
since you got here?

12:45.766 --> 12:48.566
Well, I, uh..

12:48.568 --> 12:50.034
Uh, w.. I, uh..

12:50.036 --> 12:52.904
Uh..

12:52.906 --> 12:54.773
Willie?

12:54.775 --> 12:57.709
Oh, well, he..

12:57.711 --> 12:59.511
...he eats a lot.

12:59.513 --> 13:01.579
Have I left anything out, ALF?

13:04.050 --> 13:06.050
This is incredible.

13:06.052 --> 13:07.919
First, my wife leaves me

13:07.921 --> 13:09.554
then I meet an alien.

13:09.556 --> 13:12.090
How many people can say that?

13:18.732 --> 13:22.600
(Dorothy)
You think, if they could get 250
tons of metal supply

13:22.602 --> 13:25.703
how hard could it be to find
two pieces of luggage

13:25.705 --> 13:29.140
day glow pink yarn?

13:29.142 --> 13:30.708
Mom, enough talk
about the luggage.

13:30.710 --> 13:34.612
They said, they'll call, they'll
call. You're driving me crazy.

13:34.614 --> 13:37.482
You used to be
such an agreeable child.

13:38.952 --> 13:42.086
Mom, Whizzer has been
playing music for 40 years

13:42.088 --> 13:43.555
he has known you
for less than two

13:43.557 --> 13:46.057
you're behaving like a child.

13:46.059 --> 13:47.992
Why don't you just call him?

13:47.994 --> 13:50.495
And give him the satisfaction?

13:50.497 --> 13:53.398
- Mom!
- Anyway, I can't.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.233
I don't even know where he is.

13:55.235 --> 13:57.969
For all I know, he's in some
two-bit jazz club

13:57.971 --> 14:00.805
buying a drink for some
lonely middle-age floozy.

14:00.807 --> 14:03.274
- Oh, Whizzer won't do that.
- Are you kidding?

14:03.276 --> 14:05.210
How do you think he met me?

14:06.780 --> 14:09.280
[instrumental music]

14:11.084 --> 14:13.852
Come on, 7, come, 11.

14:13.854 --> 14:16.821
Daddy needs a new pair of shoes.

14:16.823 --> 14:20.124
Don't give me no boxcars, baby.

14:20.126 --> 14:21.392
Yeah, oh, yeah

14:21.394 --> 14:23.228
mama, come to papa.

14:23.230 --> 14:26.097
You know what I like.

14:26.099 --> 14:30.101
Do you have to comment
on every single card?

14:30.103 --> 14:31.369
It's a quick drop
from wonderment

14:31.371 --> 14:33.872
to aggravation,
isn't it, Whizzer?

14:33.874 --> 14:36.140
Come on, shut up and bet.

14:36.142 --> 14:37.642
Who didn't ante?

14:37.644 --> 14:39.077
You, ALF.

14:39.079 --> 14:40.245
Oh, right.

14:40.247 --> 14:42.180
Cover me, Neal.

14:43.149 --> 14:44.649
What's the limit?

14:44.651 --> 14:47.952
$5.00. Same as it was
a half an hour ago.

14:47.954 --> 14:50.855
Okay, keep your shorts on.

14:50.857 --> 14:53.591
I open for a quarter.

14:53.593 --> 14:55.159
- I'm in.
- Me, too.

14:55.161 --> 14:56.194
I'll stay for a quarter.

14:56.196 --> 14:57.195
Sure, why not?

14:57.197 --> 15:00.198
Well, too rich for my blood.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.467
You were the one
that made the bet!

15:02.469 --> 15:04.435
Oh, hello, Mr. Hoyle!

15:04.437 --> 15:07.405
I didn't see you come in!

15:07.407 --> 15:08.773
Cards, everybody.

15:08.775 --> 15:11.976
Okay, I'll stay
with what I've got.

15:11.978 --> 15:13.845
Two's fine.

15:13.847 --> 15:15.480
One, please.

15:16.783 --> 15:18.116
Will you not

15:18.118 --> 15:21.185
please not keep
looking at my cards?

15:21.187 --> 15:23.621
Then keep them out of my face.

15:25.025 --> 15:26.391
Give me two.

15:26.393 --> 15:28.359
Dealer takes three.

15:28.361 --> 15:30.662
That sounds good.
I'll have the same.

15:30.664 --> 15:33.131
You already said
you didn't want any.

15:33.133 --> 15:34.666
It's too late.

15:34.668 --> 15:39.203
But that was before I knew
what Willie's cards were.

15:39.205 --> 15:42.106
I'm out.

15:42.108 --> 15:44.075
What was the limit, again?

15:44.077 --> 15:46.411
(all)
$5.00!

15:46.413 --> 15:50.014
Well, in that case,
I'll bet 35 cents.

15:51.551 --> 15:54.919
I'll see that 35 cents

15:54.921 --> 15:57.288
and I'll raise you $1.00.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.823
I'm out.

15:58.825 --> 16:00.458
Yep, me too.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.560
Well, they're dropping
like flies.

16:02.562 --> 16:04.295
The bluff's working.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.830
Alright, I'll see that $1.00

16:05.832 --> 16:09.801
and I'll keep it company
with.. What's the limit?

16:09.803 --> 16:13.271
I'm kidding!
Kidding, man!

16:13.273 --> 16:15.440
Uh, Willie

16:15.442 --> 16:17.308
would you stake me?

16:17.310 --> 16:20.845
To what?
Uh, I mean, yeah. Sure.

16:23.917 --> 16:26.150
Hm.

16:26.152 --> 16:27.919
Oh, come on,
Uncle Neal, stay in.

16:27.921 --> 16:29.220
He can't know what he's doing.

16:29.222 --> 16:31.456
Don't be a fool, Neal, fold.

16:31.458 --> 16:34.559
Nobody plays that stupidly
without having a plan.

16:34.561 --> 16:37.729
Trust me, there's no plan.

16:39.165 --> 16:43.034
Okay, I'll see you four

16:43.036 --> 16:46.237
and I'll raise you five.

16:46.239 --> 16:48.573
What do you say, big talker?

16:51.478 --> 16:54.512
Thanks.
Let's see 'em, Neal!

16:54.514 --> 16:56.948
Three queens!
What have you got?

16:56.950 --> 17:00.585
Well, enough sense not to bet
with my own money!

17:00.587 --> 17:04.822
My deal! Five-card draw,
all red cards wild!

17:08.495 --> 17:11.662
Well, the place
is still standing.

17:11.664 --> 17:14.499
What did you do, dump the alien?

17:14.501 --> 17:16.401
No, he's still with us.

17:16.403 --> 17:17.435
As a matter of fact,
we're throwing him

17:17.437 --> 17:18.970
a party in his honor.

17:18.972 --> 17:20.605
Open or closed casket?

17:22.008 --> 17:23.374
[sighs]
I'm sorry.

17:23.376 --> 17:24.876
I guess I'm just upset.

17:24.878 --> 17:28.546
It's not every day
you lose your luggage.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.581
Mom, you'll spend
the night with us

17:30.583 --> 17:32.483
and in the morning, you'll
get in touch with Whizzer

17:32.485 --> 17:34.285
and discuss your differences

17:34.287 --> 17:36.988
like mature, rational adults.

17:36.990 --> 17:39.424
(Whizzer)
Come on, come on,
give me my cards!

17:39.426 --> 17:41.526
- Give me my cards back!
- No!

17:41.528 --> 17:42.727
- Yes!
- Make me!

17:42.729 --> 17:43.928
Step outside, you little--

17:43.930 --> 17:45.797
Whizzer!

17:45.799 --> 17:46.964
Dorothy.

17:46.966 --> 17:49.067
What are you doing here?

17:49.069 --> 17:50.568
I came looking for you.

17:51.905 --> 17:54.839
So, you met cousin "IT."

17:54.841 --> 17:57.341
Met him?
He's cheated me at cards.

17:57.343 --> 17:59.010
Sore loser!

17:59.012 --> 18:01.412
Can't prove it.

18:01.414 --> 18:03.114
Oh, Dorothy,
good to see you again.

18:03.116 --> 18:04.982
Yes, Willie.

18:04.984 --> 18:07.885
- Hi, grandma.
- Ah, sweetheart.

18:07.887 --> 18:09.987
- Hi, Dorothy.
- Hello, Neal.

18:09.989 --> 18:12.857
Oh, I 'm sorry about
you and Margaret.

18:12.859 --> 18:15.393
Aw, thanks, Dorothy.
It was a tough adjustment.

18:15.395 --> 18:16.594
I mean, after all,
when you've spent

18:16.596 --> 18:17.595
as much time with one person--

18:17.597 --> 18:19.063
Can it, Neal!

18:19.065 --> 18:20.998
She's not interested.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.468
So, Dorothy, can I
get you something?

18:23.470 --> 18:27.004
A cab? A rickshaw? A broom?

18:28.408 --> 18:32.009
No, maybe just a baseball bat

18:32.011 --> 18:33.945
and a small body bag.

18:35.348 --> 18:36.614
I-I think maybe
we should give

18:36.616 --> 18:39.083
Dorothy and ALF
a little privacy.

18:39.085 --> 18:40.985
Don't you mean Whizzer?

18:40.987 --> 18:42.019
What did I say?

18:42.021 --> 18:43.421
You said "ALF."

18:43.423 --> 18:46.023
Oh, what could I
have been thinking?

18:46.025 --> 18:49.260
Mom, talk to Whizzer.

18:49.262 --> 18:53.030
Not in front of
the orange hairball.

18:53.032 --> 18:54.832
At least mine's natural.

18:57.937 --> 19:02.039
Come on, Whizzer,
we have got to talk.

19:02.041 --> 19:06.144
She's just cranky because Toto
escaped from her little basket.

19:09.082 --> 19:10.748
Look, Whizzer

19:10.750 --> 19:14.619
we're obviously two
very different people

19:14.621 --> 19:17.522
with two completely
different approaches to life

19:17.524 --> 19:20.158
who happen to be
attracted to each other.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.527
The only solution
that I can see is

19:22.529 --> 19:24.629
you have to change.

19:24.631 --> 19:27.231
Dorothy, what are you doing?
What do you want?

19:27.233 --> 19:29.500
[sighs]
Triplets.

19:29.502 --> 19:31.736
What do you think I want?
I want a home.

19:31.738 --> 19:33.104
Is that too much to ask?

19:33.106 --> 19:35.673
Oh, so we're starting
on that one again.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.875
Look, there's one thing
you have to understand.

19:37.877 --> 19:40.978
You're not more important
in this relationship than I am.

19:40.980 --> 19:44.182
- I don't think that!
- Yes, you do.

19:44.184 --> 19:46.350
So what if I do?

19:46.352 --> 19:48.886
Well, I think if we have a
prayer of making this marriage

19:48.888 --> 19:50.755
work, we're gonna
have to ask ourselves

19:50.757 --> 19:52.924
one very important question.

19:52.926 --> 19:55.560
And be honest.

19:55.562 --> 19:58.596
Do you love me,
or am I just convenient?

19:58.598 --> 20:00.731
You're convenient.

20:00.733 --> 20:03.201
Well, so are you.

20:03.203 --> 20:05.102
And I love you.

20:05.104 --> 20:07.104
And I love you.

20:08.775 --> 20:11.676
You know, you'd think after
three marriages between us, we'd

20:11.678 --> 20:13.544
we'd be better at this?

20:13.546 --> 20:16.080
So, what are we gonna do?

20:16.082 --> 20:20.084
Well, each of us is going to
have to give up something.

20:20.086 --> 20:22.186
You first.

20:22.188 --> 20:25.323
Well, I can't give
up music, but..

20:25.325 --> 20:27.658
...I will agree to look
for a permanent gig

20:27.660 --> 20:29.660
and wherever
that turns out to be

20:29.662 --> 20:31.829
we can live there.
How's that?

20:31.831 --> 20:35.666
That is so giving
and thoughtful of you.

20:35.668 --> 20:37.335
- Can we live here?
- No.

20:37.337 --> 20:40.571
Now, this is the part where
you have to give up something.

20:40.573 --> 20:43.074
Alright, I'll give up
the triplets.

20:43.076 --> 20:46.310
What do I need with
more stretch marks, anyway?

20:46.312 --> 20:50.581
- Dorothy.
- Tsk. But I like being here.

20:50.583 --> 20:53.084
I like being close
to Kate and the kids.

20:53.086 --> 20:55.253
How can you ask
me to give that up?

20:55.255 --> 20:58.189
Well, I was hoping
you'd like to be near me.

21:01.361 --> 21:03.494
Do you say that to
every cheap floozy

21:03.496 --> 21:05.663
you pick up at a bar?

21:06.699 --> 21:08.833
Only the ones I marry.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.606
Oh, gross!

21:16.709 --> 21:19.810
Now, I won't be able
to eat for a week.

21:21.314 --> 21:25.416
Kate! Get in the kitchen
and hose down your mother.

21:25.418 --> 21:27.118
Yuck!

21:28.388 --> 21:29.053
[instrumental music]

21:32.959 --> 21:36.527
Ahem. You know, I miss
being nice like this.

21:36.529 --> 21:40.665
I know.
I hate it when we fight.

21:40.667 --> 21:43.267
Of course, making
up has its advantages.

21:43.269 --> 21:45.169
[chuckling]

21:46.406 --> 21:48.472
[both moan]

21:48.474 --> 21:49.907
Are you sure
you two wouldn't be

21:49.909 --> 21:52.510
more comfortable at the y?

21:52.512 --> 21:53.878
[sighs]

21:53.880 --> 21:55.713
Shouldn't you be
digging yourself

21:55.715 --> 21:58.883
a hole for the night?

21:58.885 --> 22:02.753
You know, Dorothy, they should
make a movie of your life story.

22:02.755 --> 22:06.324
They could call it
"Lady Brings The Blues."

22:08.227 --> 22:12.663
ALF, can we be<i> alone?</i>

22:12.665 --> 22:14.932
Well, I appreciate
the offer, but

22:14.934 --> 22:17.735
I'd rather swallow a hammer.

22:17.737 --> 22:21.505
Can't the two of you get
along for even five minutes?

22:21.507 --> 22:24.875
Hey! This is as good as it gets.

22:24.877 --> 22:29.313
Well then, are you planning
to stand there the whole night?

22:29.315 --> 22:30.981
Of course not.

22:30.983 --> 22:33.150
Just till "Letterman" is over.

22:35.054 --> 22:37.355
Maybe they have the
dancing poodles tonight.

22:38.758 --> 22:41.058
[theme music]

22:42.862 --> 22:45.062
[theme music]

23:09.655 --> 23:12.957
Ha-ha-ha!
Yuck!
