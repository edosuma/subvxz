01:09.320 --> 01:11.422
What do you think?

01:11.480 --> 01:15.586
Well, I have one more piece coming
up, and it is really gorgeous.

01:15.600 --> 01:17.941
But darling, give
this one a chance.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.901
Look at it for a few minutes, all right?
I'll be right back.

01:27.960 --> 01:28.822
Laurie?

01:28.840 --> 01:30.143
Yes?
Angel.

01:30.160 --> 01:31.182
Yes?

01:31.200 --> 01:33.103
- Is the sherbet resort ready?
- Here it comes.

01:33.120 --> 01:35.067
It's coming.
Mrs. Grimaldi is waiting.

01:35.080 --> 01:36.261
No, no, no.

01:36.360 --> 01:38.747
No, no, I'll dress
the model myself.

01:38.760 --> 01:40.703
Uh... oh my god, it's 5 o'clock.

01:40.720 --> 01:41.742
Send the girls home.

01:41.760 --> 01:43.271
I'm not paying any overtime.

01:49.960 --> 01:51.824
Sorry.

01:51.880 --> 01:55.985
Have you reconsidered it?

01:56.040 --> 01:58.119
Can I see the other style, please?

01:58.120 --> 02:00.109
Uh, it's coming right up.

02:00.200 --> 02:01.540
Thank you, Eileen.

02:01.560 --> 02:04.550
Very pretty.

02:04.600 --> 02:08.102
When she moves, the material
review seems to flow.

02:08.120 --> 02:10.550
It's like quicksilver.
Turn around, honey.

02:13.880 --> 02:15.311
What do you think?

02:17.600 --> 02:18.986
It's nice.

02:19.040 --> 02:22.144
Let's do it in three
colors, five sizes.

02:22.200 --> 02:24.780
For all the stores.

02:24.800 --> 02:26.664
Excellent.

02:26.720 --> 02:27.821
Excellent!

02:27.880 --> 02:29.425
You have impeccable taste, my dear.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.383
Come on, let's get
to Marty McGuire's.

02:31.400 --> 02:33.502
I hope that lawyer guy
is going to be there.

02:33.560 --> 02:35.307
You remember him?
Oh, yeah, I remember him.

02:35.320 --> 02:37.791
Come on, Thana, let's go.
I really liked him.

02:37.840 --> 02:39.863
OK, bright and
early in the morning.

02:39.880 --> 02:41.186
Good night, honey.

02:41.240 --> 02:43.183
Everything's locked up.

02:43.200 --> 02:45.029
And the machines are shut off?

02:45.040 --> 02:46.141
Yes, good night.

02:46.160 --> 02:48.183
The two best
seamstresses in town.

02:48.240 --> 02:50.707
Grimaldi loved it.

02:50.720 --> 02:52.026
Thana.

02:52.040 --> 02:55.587
Good night, honey.

02:58.800 --> 03:01.585
Here comes those girls.

03:08.560 --> 03:09.908
Vaya mami!
Vaya!

03:12.480 --> 03:16.221
You do look good.

03:16.280 --> 03:18.986
Hey, sweetie, you
wanna sit on my face?

03:19.000 --> 03:20.465
Fuck off.

03:22.880 --> 03:24.823
Oh, mama.

03:24.840 --> 03:25.827
Hey, baby.

03:27.840 --> 03:31.183
Come here, sugar.

03:31.200 --> 03:34.588
Are you sure you don't want
to come with us for a drink?

03:34.640 --> 03:37.425
You'll have a good time.

03:37.440 --> 03:38.063
All right.

03:38.120 --> 03:40.265
We'll see you tomorrow.
Bye-bye.

04:26.560 --> 04:28.747
Produce department,
pick up the telephone, please.

04:28.760 --> 04:30.100
Produce department.

05:36.080 --> 05:40.187
You make one sound, I'm gonna
stick this thing in your mouth.

05:40.200 --> 05:42.507
Then I'm gonna shoot it off.

06:02.120 --> 06:03.381
You're good.

06:03.400 --> 06:05.707
That was great, baby,
but I gotta go now.

06:05.760 --> 06:06.543
I'll see you.

06:06.600 --> 06:07.701
I'll see you again.

06:07.760 --> 06:09.541
I'll be back.
I will.

08:45.600 --> 08:48.180
Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh!

08:48.200 --> 08:50.667
Now we're gonna
play a little game.

08:50.680 --> 08:53.943
You talk and I kill you.

08:53.960 --> 08:55.983
Now I'm gonna take my
hand off your mouth.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.784
If you scream...

08:57.800 --> 08:59.550
barn!

08:59.600 --> 09:00.861
Now let's try it.

09:05.760 --> 09:07.100
That's good.

09:07.120 --> 09:10.747
That's real good.

09:10.760 --> 09:12.225
Now where's the money?

09:14.160 --> 09:16.024
Where's the money?

09:16.040 --> 09:19.542
What's the matter with you?

09:19.560 --> 09:21.503
Talk.

09:21.520 --> 09:23.827
Talk!

09:23.840 --> 09:25.430
You can't talk, huh?

09:25.480 --> 09:26.741
You can't talk?

09:32.000 --> 09:33.465
Open the bag.

09:35.480 --> 09:36.945
Give me the bag!

09:50.760 --> 09:53.545
What's the matter with you?

09:53.560 --> 09:54.821
What happened to you?

09:57.400 --> 10:00.310
Come on, chicky babe,
don't be modest.

10:32.440 --> 10:33.701
Mmm.

10:58.080 --> 11:01.980
This ought to make you talk, hm?

11:02.000 --> 11:03.465
Come on.

11:40.800 --> 11:42.231
Aughh!

12:00.800 --> 12:02.902
Is flowing smoothly on both levels.

12:03.880 --> 12:05.061
It's 6:09.

12:05.160 --> 12:07.306
The temperature in
Central Park is 52.

12:07.320 --> 12:09.720
Going down to the low 40s tonight.
Continued fair tomorrow...

14:32.600 --> 14:35.750
Come here, Sam.

14:35.800 --> 14:37.231
Come on.

15:17.720 --> 15:18.981
What is this?

15:22.080 --> 15:25.866
I said a V-neck!

15:25.880 --> 15:27.345
Not a scoop neck!

15:32.680 --> 15:35.624
What are you gawking at?

15:38.080 --> 15:40.626
All right, girls.

15:40.680 --> 15:42.782
Back to the drawing board.

16:07.920 --> 16:09.665
Thana, do you have
this shirt ready?

16:12.240 --> 16:15.310
Thana, are you all right?

16:15.320 --> 16:17.422
Thana?

16:17.440 --> 16:19.668
What's the matter with Thana?

16:22.560 --> 16:24.503
Thana?

16:24.520 --> 16:25.826
Thana?

16:25.840 --> 16:27.226
Thana, what's the matter?

16:27.240 --> 16:28.227
Thana?

16:28.240 --> 16:30.101
You OK?
Are you OK?

16:30.120 --> 16:31.759
Are you OK?
What's the matter?

16:31.760 --> 16:33.741
Thana?
Do you feel well?

16:33.800 --> 16:36.351
- Would you like to sit down?
- Thana?

16:36.400 --> 16:37.865
Would you like a glass of water?

16:37.920 --> 16:39.306
Let me feel your forehead.

16:39.320 --> 16:40.865
Thana, maybe you should sit down.

16:40.880 --> 16:42.469
Come over here.
Would you like to sit down?

16:42.520 --> 16:43.462
Thana?

16:43.520 --> 16:45.190
What happened to her?

16:45.240 --> 16:46.705
Thana, now maybe
you should sit down.

16:46.720 --> 16:48.460
Would you like a glass of water?

21:54.480 --> 21:57.060
What's in that bag?

21:58.120 --> 22:00.063
Oh, Phil, get out of the way.

22:04.080 --> 22:06.581
I'll take the bag out for you.

22:06.600 --> 22:09.306
Really, let me do it.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.788
Thana, what did you...
what's wrong, honey?

23:21.800 --> 23:24.301
Are you all right?

23:24.320 --> 23:26.548
Is anything wrong, honey?

23:35.040 --> 23:36.187
Little girl.

23:36.200 --> 23:38.428
Hey, uh, little girl, sweetheart.

23:38.520 --> 23:39.542
Where you going?

23:39.600 --> 23:40.879
What's the hurry?

23:40.880 --> 23:45.943
Ah, Jesus Christ almighty, everybody's
in a goddamn hurry today, huh?

23:45.960 --> 23:47.107
Huh, Ben?

23:47.160 --> 23:49.945
Goddamn chicks are
cold as ice, huh?

23:50.000 --> 23:51.625
You ain't missing shit.

23:54.000 --> 23:56.785
Hey, baby doll, you look
pretty good today, huh?

23:56.840 --> 23:57.839
Hey, what's the matter?

23:57.840 --> 23:59.669
I got bad breath or something?

23:59.680 --> 24:02.545
A-and maybe I ain't good
enough for you, huh?

24:02.560 --> 24:04.981
Hey, Lassie.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.465
Fucking cunt.

24:51.480 --> 24:52.467
Hey, baby!

24:52.480 --> 24:53.229
Your bag!

24:53.240 --> 24:54.944
You forgot your bag!

25:04.240 --> 25:05.944
You forgot your bag!

26:22.160 --> 26:23.742
Thana!
Thana!

26:23.760 --> 26:25.305
Open the door!

26:25.320 --> 26:27.309
Thana!

26:27.320 --> 26:28.262
Open!

26:28.320 --> 26:29.103
Thana!

26:29.120 --> 26:30.506
What's wrong with you?

26:30.520 --> 26:33.146
I heard you run up the
stairs like a phantom!

26:33.160 --> 26:35.786
And throwing up all the place?

26:35.800 --> 26:38.750
There's something wrong with you.
I'm going to call a doctor.

26:38.760 --> 26:40.100
Oh, yes I am.

26:40.160 --> 26:42.069
Yes... uh, Phil, where are you?

26:42.120 --> 26:43.745
Come on, Phil.

26:47.000 --> 26:47.942
Oh, Phil!

26:48.000 --> 26:49.511
What are you doing in there?

26:49.520 --> 26:51.270
Come on out.

26:51.280 --> 26:52.381
Phil, you naughty dog.

26:52.400 --> 26:58.860
Now you get out of there right now!

26:58.880 --> 27:00.599
I think I ought to call Dr. Fisher.

27:00.600 --> 27:02.429
You look very bad.

27:02.440 --> 27:03.427
You really do.

27:03.440 --> 27:06.020
I'm going to call the doctor.

27:06.040 --> 27:08.302
All right, we'll see about it.

27:25.440 --> 27:27.986
What's the matter with you?

27:28.080 --> 27:31.070
What happened to you?

27:31.080 --> 27:32.944
'Cause you're mute,
you dress like that?

28:03.800 --> 28:05.026
Hey, Mister, nickel?

28:05.040 --> 28:05.823
Dime?

28:05.840 --> 28:07.351
Anything.

28:08.920 --> 28:10.670
Aah, go fuck yourself.

28:54.080 --> 28:57.150
Harold's Incorporated.

28:57.160 --> 29:01.424
Thana, I guess what I'm trying
to say is I'm concerned about you.

29:01.440 --> 29:05.067
You insist that you're feeling
better, but still, your work

29:05.080 --> 29:08.389
these past few days has
not been up to par.

29:08.400 --> 29:12.869
On top of scorching the silk
blouse, you sewed only two

29:12.880 --> 29:16.999
cuff buttons instead of three
on all the print suits.

29:17.000 --> 29:19.785
I had to have them all recalled.

29:19.800 --> 29:24.747
Darling, I realize that you're
working under a tremendous

29:24.760 --> 29:30.310
handicap, which is precisely
why you have to try harder

29:30.360 --> 29:33.862
than a normal person.

29:33.880 --> 29:36.460
You know we all love you here.

29:36.480 --> 29:40.505
You know we all want
you to do well.

29:40.520 --> 29:44.511
So promise me you'll
get back on the track.

29:44.520 --> 29:49.199
Show more interest in
your work, more spirit.

29:49.200 --> 29:52.509
Be like the other girls.

29:52.560 --> 29:57.109
There's the Halloween
party on the 31 st.

29:57.120 --> 29:59.791
All of us are going.

29:59.800 --> 30:02.141
You should come, too.

30:02.160 --> 30:05.662
There'll be boys your own age.

30:05.680 --> 30:07.509
You'll enjoy yourself.

30:07.520 --> 30:08.781
Have fun.

30:22.560 --> 30:23.502
Good.

30:23.560 --> 30:24.786
I believe you will.

30:24.840 --> 30:27.750
Now tell Laurie to come in
here for a minute, please.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.465
OK.

30:37.840 --> 30:38.782
Now?

30:38.800 --> 30:39.742
OK.

30:39.760 --> 30:41.544
I'll be right in.

30:41.600 --> 30:45.705
Look, I'll get back to
you in about 15 minutes.

30:45.720 --> 30:46.981
Bye.

30:52.640 --> 30:53.741
Thana, come here.

30:53.760 --> 30:55.479
Why did Albert want to
see you in his office?

30:55.480 --> 30:58.106
Is he upset?

30:58.120 --> 30:59.585
What's wrong?

31:30.600 --> 31:33.271
Can I have the ashtray?
Thank you.

31:38.120 --> 31:40.465
Don't you like your sandwich?
It's terrible.

31:40.480 --> 31:42.901
You know, I don't know why
we keep coming to this place.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.101
I don't either.

31:44.160 --> 31:45.591
We barely have time for coffee now.

31:45.600 --> 31:48.180
Hey, Mrs. Onassis, what about
the coffee we ordered?

31:48.200 --> 31:50.591
I'll get it for you right now.
No, skip the coffee.

31:50.640 --> 31:52.740
Just get us the check.
We have to get back to work.

31:52.760 --> 31:53.941
OK, you want separate?

31:53.960 --> 31:55.221
Just put it on one.

31:55.240 --> 31:56.980
What, do we look like
strangers over here?

31:57.000 --> 31:58.861
OK.
OK.

32:05.080 --> 32:06.625
What is this, a zoo?

32:08.000 --> 32:11.582
They look like a couple
of monkeys going at it.

32:11.600 --> 32:14.306
Hey, lady, we're trying
to eat over here.

32:14.360 --> 32:15.302
This is a restaurant.

32:15.320 --> 32:16.706
It's not Plato's Retreat.

32:19.400 --> 32:21.741
Bye.

32:21.760 --> 32:23.271
See you later.

32:28.480 --> 32:32.588
Here, let me make sure Madame Curie
didn't make any mistakes on here.

32:32.600 --> 32:34.599
OK, it's $3.50 a piece.

32:34.600 --> 32:36.865
It's $4 with a tip.
Everybody put up $4?

32:45.520 --> 32:47.543
Hey, ladies.

32:47.560 --> 32:50.743
May I joint you in an
after-dinner drink?

32:50.760 --> 32:52.589
Sweet ladies.

32:55.840 --> 32:56.827
I'm buying.

32:56.880 --> 32:57.902
Fuck off!

32:57.920 --> 32:59.067
What?

32:59.120 --> 33:01.669
You heard me.
Get fucked!

33:01.720 --> 33:03.982
Get bent!

33:04.080 --> 33:06.501
You fucking wimp,
get the hell out of here.

33:06.560 --> 33:08.359
- Heard you, all right.
- Beat it!

33:08.360 --> 33:09.942
Scram!
Take it easy!

33:09.960 --> 33:11.822
Get bent.
Take it easy, my ass.

33:11.920 --> 33:13.829
Believe the nerve of this guy?

33:13.840 --> 33:15.510
Here you go.

33:19.920 --> 33:23.669
I can't believe how much work we've
got to get done this afternoon.

33:23.680 --> 33:24.622
Yeah, I know.

33:24.640 --> 33:25.821
I have to go to the bank.

33:25.840 --> 33:27.146
I hope there's not a long line.

33:27.160 --> 33:29.001
Here, Thana, you pay the bill.
I'll meet you...

33:30.080 --> 33:33.020
Hey, listen, Thana, we'll see you
later at the office, all right?

33:48.760 --> 33:50.271
Bye-bye.

34:28.480 --> 34:31.504
Listen, uh, baby, how you doing?

34:31.520 --> 34:32.746
Uh, look.

34:32.840 --> 34:35.745
I didn't mean to seem forward or out of
place in that restaurant or anything.

34:35.840 --> 34:37.748
It's no reason for your sister
to get carried away like that.

34:37.800 --> 34:41.109
Just wanted to say hello,
introduce myself.

34:41.120 --> 34:42.870
Rich Volk, fashion photographer.

34:42.880 --> 34:46.427
You know, "Vogue," "Cosmo,"
the layout of Atlanta in

34:46.440 --> 34:49.199
"Elle," the wind in the zebra
skins at the Plaza Fountain?

34:49.199 --> 34:50.062
You know my stuff.

34:50.080 --> 34:51.420
It's been all over.

34:57.680 --> 34:58.906
Hey, wait a minute.

34:58.920 --> 34:59.907
Just a second.

34:59.920 --> 35:01.465
I just want to talk to you.

35:01.520 --> 35:04.468
See, I'm a photographer.
I'm a gourmet of beauty.

35:04.480 --> 35:08.625
And when I saw you in that restaurant
in that light, I said to myself, wow!

35:08.680 --> 35:13.461
I mean, it was like a Renoir or a Matisse,
and uh, that's why I wanted to talk to you.

35:13.520 --> 35:14.621
No other reason.

35:14.680 --> 35:17.624
I mean, when I see beauty,
I gotta go after it.

35:21.200 --> 35:23.462
You're not a model, right?

35:23.480 --> 35:28.871
No, you are much too
beautiful to be a model.

35:28.880 --> 35:33.224
Much too beautiful to be a model.

35:33.240 --> 35:36.300
Listen, uh, what do you say?
My studio's right around the corner.

35:36.360 --> 35:37.666
Nobody's gonna be there.

35:37.680 --> 35:38.827
It's Friday.

35:38.840 --> 35:41.591
And we'll take a test.

35:41.600 --> 35:42.940
Hm?

35:42.960 --> 35:44.903
Smoke a little pot?

35:44.920 --> 35:46.351
Dig not, huh?

35:46.400 --> 35:49.902
Little wine, and uh, we'll
crank off a roll of shots.

35:49.920 --> 35:52.671
No big deal.

35:52.720 --> 35:54.743
You got nothing to lose.

36:03.440 --> 36:04.666
Yeah.

36:04.720 --> 36:08.825
I knew you were a smart
kid the minute I saw you.

36:08.840 --> 36:12.387
Hey, there's no sense being
shy with a face like that.

36:12.440 --> 36:13.826
Trust me.

36:13.840 --> 36:17.430
I'm going to make it work for you, show
you how to make the big bucks, OK?

36:17.440 --> 36:18.189
Here.

36:18.200 --> 36:20.029
Here's my place here, 54.

36:20.040 --> 36:21.908
Wait till you see this place.
You're not gonna believe it.

36:21.920 --> 36:22.862
It's beautiful.

36:22.920 --> 36:24.590
Right in here.

36:29.240 --> 36:31.502
OK, just hold on one second.

36:47.640 --> 36:50.346
OK, this is the place.

36:50.360 --> 36:51.109
Come on.

36:51.120 --> 36:52.665
You're gonna love it.

36:52.680 --> 36:55.226
Wait till you see.

36:55.280 --> 36:59.584
Didn't I tell you to trust me?
I mean, isn't this a beautiful place?

38:10.640 --> 38:12.199
Mrs. Nasone, I'm sorry.

38:12.200 --> 38:13.586
It won't happen again.

38:13.640 --> 38:17.540
But, like, I had my copy
and I changed my pants.

38:17.560 --> 38:18.309
I mean...

38:18.360 --> 38:20.827
Oh, Nicky, you're hopeless.

38:20.880 --> 38:23.824
You're always losing your keys.

38:23.840 --> 38:25.787
But it's not my fault!
The same story!

38:25.800 --> 38:28.107
It's not...

38:28.120 --> 38:29.107
Thana!

38:29.160 --> 38:31.069
What's all that makeup?

38:31.120 --> 38:32.267
Good heavens!

38:32.280 --> 38:34.986
I've never seen you look like that.

38:35.080 --> 38:36.341
Your eyes.

38:36.360 --> 38:41.341
And your lips are
so heavily made up.

38:41.360 --> 38:44.919
"Staying overnight with a friend"?

38:44.920 --> 38:46.385
What friend?

38:50.320 --> 38:51.831
Kennedy.

39:47.760 --> 39:50.784
I'm tired of you playing
a game, you understand?

39:50.800 --> 39:53.160
What are you talking about?
Now I want the rest of my money.

39:53.200 --> 39:54.745
But I don't have any money.

39:54.760 --> 39:56.100
I gave you $50, didn't I?

39:56.160 --> 39:58.740
Baby, you sure you
ain't got $50 more?

39:58.760 --> 39:59.907
How much you think...

39:59.920 --> 40:02.460
You sure you ain't got $50 more?
Five minutes.

40:02.480 --> 40:03.866
Five minutes we're in
there, and he gave me $50.

40:03.920 --> 40:05.181
How much you think
he's gonna give me?

40:05.200 --> 40:06.631
And besides, bay, I wouldn't
hold out on you.

40:06.640 --> 40:09.505
Listen, baby, that last
trick you had was a set-up.

40:09.520 --> 40:11.145
Now I gave him $100.

40:11.160 --> 40:12.591
You gonna give me $50.

40:12.680 --> 40:15.319
Baby, I don't care how much you
gave him, but he gave me $50.

40:15.320 --> 40:16.865
You calling my friend a liar?

40:16.880 --> 40:17.867
Yeah, he is!

40:17.880 --> 40:19.623
Huh?
What'd you call my friend?

40:23.640 --> 40:25.199
Oh, don't hit me no more!

40:25.200 --> 40:26.790
Baby, don't hit me no more!

40:26.840 --> 40:27.782
Don't hit me!

40:27.800 --> 40:30.141
Never fuck with my money!

40:30.160 --> 40:31.799
Baby, don't hit me no more!

42:32.840 --> 42:35.307
We want everything you got, baby.

42:55.720 --> 42:56.469
Now!

43:04.840 --> 43:07.782
Please, don't!
Don't!

43:28.480 --> 43:31.789
Hunter, pick her up.

43:43.400 --> 43:45.582
Perhaps we can give
you a lift somewhere?

44:27.480 --> 44:29.742
Are you going anywhere particular?

44:46.760 --> 44:49.386
Then perhaps you'd like
to come with me tonight.

46:17.520 --> 46:19.679
Police are still mystified by two

46:19.680 --> 46:21.987
apparently unconnected
multiple murders that took

46:22.000 --> 46:25.422
place in Midtown Manhattan
last night in the largest mass

46:25.440 --> 46:27.622
killing in New York
City in eight years.

46:31.520 --> 46:34.231
In Bethesda
Fountain in Central Park.

46:34.240 --> 46:36.581
All the victims had been shot
with a 45-caliber pistol.

46:36.600 --> 46:39.704
Meanwhile, at 48th Street and
Park Avenue, a wealthy Saudi

46:39.720 --> 46:44.030
Arabian businessman, Sheikh Mohammad
al Faisal, was shot to death...

46:44.040 --> 46:44.982
Oh, it's Thana.

46:45.040 --> 46:46.380
Come on in.

46:46.400 --> 46:47.581
Along with his chauffeur...

46:47.600 --> 46:49.668
Oh, you brought something for Phil.

46:51.800 --> 46:53.106
Here, Phil.

46:53.160 --> 46:54.785
Look what Thana brought you.

46:54.800 --> 46:56.425
A motive in the killing, since the

46:56.440 --> 47:00.147
sheikh was found carrying
more than $2,800 in cash.

47:00.160 --> 47:04.319
Police are continuing
both investigations.

47:04.320 --> 47:06.900
Talks will resume this morning
between the sanitation workers

47:06.920 --> 47:11.590
and the city, hoping to head off a strike
now scheduled to begin at 12:01 AM Monday.

47:28.760 --> 47:30.703
There she goes again, Phil.

47:58.280 --> 48:00.269
Hey, you going out or what?

48:20.800 --> 48:23.710
But just not coming back to
work from lunch on Friday...

48:23.720 --> 48:26.426
I mean, how could you do that?

48:26.440 --> 48:29.430
It's just not fair
to the other girls.

48:29.440 --> 48:32.987
On top of having to finish
your work for you before they

48:33.000 --> 48:37.583
could go home, they
were worried sick.

48:37.640 --> 48:42.465
You could have at least gotten word back
to us somehow, has Mrs. Nasone call.

48:45.400 --> 48:52.509
Thana, darling, you promised
the other day, remember?

48:52.520 --> 48:53.781
You were trying.

48:53.800 --> 48:55.789
And look what happened.

48:58.800 --> 49:01.949
And now I hear from the other
girls that you're not coming

49:02.040 --> 49:03.790
with us to the Halloween party.

49:03.800 --> 49:05.948
Well, from this, all I can...

49:14.600 --> 49:15.986
Now this is good news.

49:18.880 --> 49:20.311
Do you know where it is?

49:25.200 --> 49:30.545
Are you, uh, planning
on going with someone?

49:34.720 --> 49:36.788
Would you like to go with me?

49:47.040 --> 49:48.027
I don't believe it!

49:48.080 --> 49:49.559
Have you ever seen her before!

49:49.560 --> 49:50.263
Yes!

49:50.280 --> 49:51.302
I've seen her in there.

49:51.320 --> 49:52.945
That's her office, and that...

49:52.960 --> 49:54.505
I guess that's her...

49:54.520 --> 49:55.382
That's her boss?

49:55.400 --> 49:56.103
Oh, god.

49:56.120 --> 49:58.547
Yes, that's his desk.
I don't believe this.

49:58.560 --> 50:00.959
If I ever ran into him, I
wouldn't know what to say to him.

50:00.960 --> 50:03.222
Albert, you gotta come
and look at this!

50:03.240 --> 50:05.707
I'll make a bet it's one
of your fantasies, Albert.

50:05.720 --> 50:07.064
Come here!
It's the second window.

50:07.960 --> 50:09.425
Can you believe it?

50:09.480 --> 50:10.991
Albert, why don't you hire
her to answer your phone?

50:11.000 --> 50:12.465
You know, I see this guy
downstairs a lot.

50:12.480 --> 50:14.867
What are you gonna say to
him next time you see him?

50:14.880 --> 50:16.391
You're gonna start laughing.

50:16.440 --> 50:17.701
I'll tell him to get some curtains.

50:17.720 --> 50:18.867
She's riding him like
a whale over there.

50:18.920 --> 50:20.749
I don't believe this.

50:20.760 --> 50:22.066
Even the lamps are shaking.

50:23.880 --> 50:26.665
They should get a...

50:26.680 --> 50:28.159
Don't know why they want to

50:28.160 --> 50:31.742
persecute me because
I don't talk to women.

50:31.760 --> 50:37.902
All women do is laugh and sing
and say the word "pussy." You

50:37.920 --> 50:41.263
ask any doctor and
he'll tell you that.

50:41.280 --> 50:43.030
Ah, yes.

50:43.040 --> 50:47.225
I don't know what's
gotten into people.

50:47.280 --> 50:51.590
Well, I'll get these things
going after a while.

50:51.640 --> 50:52.946
I just will.

50:52.960 --> 50:55.586
Oh.

51:20.960 --> 51:22.949
I gotta get back to work now.

51:22.960 --> 51:24.425
No you don't.

53:20.960 --> 53:22.710
You know, really, uh, I don't...

53:22.760 --> 53:27.741
think it's possible to find a
woman who's, uh, as good as

53:27.760 --> 53:28.907
she was, you know?

53:28.960 --> 53:31.701
We make love in the bedroom.
We'd start out in the bedroom.

53:31.720 --> 53:33.709
We'd end up in the
living room, you know?

53:33.720 --> 53:37.186
You know, we start out in the living room,
we'd end up in the bathroom, you know?

53:37.200 --> 53:39.260
I mean, we made love all
over the house, you know?

53:39.280 --> 53:40.222
You never could tell
what was gonna happen.

53:40.240 --> 53:41.830
It was fantastic.

53:41.840 --> 53:43.226
It was going along great.

53:43.280 --> 53:46.190
All of a sudden she starts
getting antsy, you know?

53:46.200 --> 53:49.110
She's got too much time
on her hands, man.

53:49.160 --> 53:50.999
She's freaking out.
She wants to do something.

53:51.000 --> 53:53.159
She wants to get a job.
And I say, hey, wait a minute.

53:53.160 --> 53:55.262
A wife of mine isn't working.

53:55.320 --> 53:56.831
She fought back, you know.

53:56.840 --> 53:58.180
So finally, I gave in.

53:58.200 --> 53:59.904
I said, all right, get
yourself a part-time job.

53:59.960 --> 54:01.471
Get yourself a full-time job.

54:01.480 --> 54:02.183
Get a job.

54:02.200 --> 54:03.745
Do something, you know?

54:03.800 --> 54:07.267
And she did that, you know, and
everything was back to normal, sort of.

54:07.320 --> 54:09.184
You know, for me it
was more just good.

54:09.200 --> 54:10.790
The sex wasn't as good, you know.

54:10.800 --> 54:16.143
But you know, it was better than, you
know, like when she was freaking out.

54:16.160 --> 54:17.559
You know... you know
I'm a salesman?

54:17.560 --> 54:21.271
I'm a shoe salesman, you know,
and I do a lot of work upstate.

54:21.280 --> 54:25.787
You know, upstate, Massachusetts,
generally the New England area.

54:25.800 --> 54:27.862
You know, and I go out of town two,
three days at a time, you know?

54:27.880 --> 54:30.631
Once every two weeks.

54:30.680 --> 54:32.782
And you know, I started
calling her, you know?

54:32.840 --> 54:35.102
Like 3 o'clock in the morning.

54:35.120 --> 54:36.267
She's not home.

54:36.280 --> 54:38.109
9 o'clock at night,
she's not home.

54:38.120 --> 54:39.824
9 o'clock in the morning,
she's not home.

54:39.840 --> 54:42.830
I'm wondering what the hell
is going on here, you know?

54:42.880 --> 54:46.471
You know, a lot of things are crossing my
mind, you know, but I'm blanking them out.

54:46.520 --> 54:47.985
I'm trying to say, yeah, well,
she may go over to her

54:48.000 --> 54:49.545
mother's house, over
to her sister's place.

54:49.560 --> 54:53.106
I don't know, a movie, going to a
museum or something like that.

54:53.120 --> 54:56.060
So anyway, I start thinking about
this cheating stuff, you know?

54:56.080 --> 54:58.467
And I can't get it
out of my mind, man.

54:58.520 --> 55:02.747
And all of a sudden, I'm trying to
imagine these guys she's cheating with.

55:02.760 --> 55:03.990
You know, what's she cheating with?
A lawyer?

55:04.040 --> 55:05.983
A banker?

55:06.000 --> 55:08.580
You know, a cop?

55:08.600 --> 55:11.180
I was fed up.

55:11.240 --> 55:14.423
I had to find out.

55:14.440 --> 55:19.102
So I told her I was working
late one night, real late.

55:19.120 --> 55:22.781
And I hid across the street in an
alley behind some garbage cans.

55:26.280 --> 55:28.986
She walked down the street a
couple of blocks and went into

55:29.000 --> 55:33.545
a building, you know, a brownstone?
I went up and I checked out the buzzers.

55:33.600 --> 55:37.429
There was four names up there and
I didn't recognize none of them.

55:37.440 --> 55:41.181
So I tried the door
and it was locked.

55:41.240 --> 55:42.944
Tried to force it, but
it wouldn't give.

55:45.240 --> 55:49.586
I tried the side door, the one that
they bring the garbage out in.

55:49.600 --> 55:52.180
It was open.

55:52.240 --> 55:54.024
I went in the back.

55:54.120 --> 55:56.302
A dark window.

55:56.320 --> 55:58.946
I looked in... there
was candlelight.

56:02.120 --> 56:05.383
And I saw her with her arms
around another woman.

56:09.360 --> 56:13.101
When I got back to our place,
I went in the bathroom and

56:13.120 --> 56:16.349
brushed my teeth and
washed my face.

56:16.360 --> 56:20.988
Then I went in the bedroom
and changed my shirt.

56:21.000 --> 56:24.710
And then I went out in the
kitchen and I strangled her cat.

56:43.160 --> 56:44.785
Is this some kind of a joke?

01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:16.187
MRS.NASONE Thana?

01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:18.064
Are you there?

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:26.348
Phil!

01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:43.347
This place is turned upside down!

01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:44.023
Phil!

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:46.381
What have you got there?

01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:47.661
It's locked.

01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:50.670
You wait here and I'm gonna
get the get the key and I'll

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:54.580
be right back.

01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:02.069
Phil!

01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:05.548
Look what you've done!

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:08.982
You naughty dog!

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.147
Phil!

01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:14.663
Now she'll know that we were here!

01:01:15.720 --> 01:01:16.559
OK, ladies.

01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:19.230
I... I want to make a
little announcement.

01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:22.025
I know all of us have been
working very hard this week...

01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:24.919
What's so funny about that?

01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:27.705
And you're looking forward
to the party this evening.

01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:32.679
So courtesy of Harold's, I've
giving you the afternoon off.

01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:38.551
There's two eggs and
they're boiling in a pot.

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:41.385
And one egg says to the other,
how do they expect us to get

01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:44.066
hard in three minutes
after we just got laid?

01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:42.464
Oh, but you haven't walked him in...
in such a long time.

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:46.508
Well...

01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:58.263
Hey, lady!

01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:00.781
Quit trying to dump the dog!

01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:47.301
What's going on?

01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:50.987
Not a hell of a lot, but did you
see the couple of the evening?

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.664
So.
Hello, Bobby.

01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:55.303
And Sister?
Thana.

01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:58.239
That's a charming name.
Is that Greek?

01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:00.069
It's Greek to you, Bobby.

01:06:08.440 --> 01:06:10.399
I'm telling you, you've
got to go to Puerto Rico.

01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:12.343
The Spanish girls, man, mmm.

01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:14.025
$300, you can get a virgin.

01:06:14.040 --> 01:06:15.904
They ship them in from
the other islands.

01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:17.590
What the hell is $300?

01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:33.239
But you promised after we had
Laura that you'd get a vasectomy.

01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:34.785
I changed my mind.

01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:45.350
How are my little brownies?

01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:47.747
My little workers,
how are you doing?

01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:49.146
Oh, Albert, you're drinking.

01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:51.547
Un poquito, Carol.

01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:55.710
Uh, excuse me, your hair
will turn to silver.

01:06:57.080 --> 01:06:59.706
Albert, how are you?

01:06:59.720 --> 01:07:00.389
Ramon.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.545
You know Ms. Benson, don't you?

01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:05.679
Of course.
You sure?

01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:08.465
Albert, who's that girl
you're with tonight?

01:07:08.480 --> 01:07:09.741
Yes.

01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:16.542
She's one of my proteges.

01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:20.785
Well, it's unfair.

01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:22.026
It's goddamn unfair.

01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:23.380
Would you shut up?

01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:25.901
We are not going to have
this discussion here.

01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:27.983
These are business
associates of mine.

01:08:10.040 --> 01:08:10.902
Thana?

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:12.988
Is that you, Thana?

01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:23.703
But Mrs. Nasone, I
didn't mean to scare you.

01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:26.470
You almost gave me a heart
attack in that idiot costume!

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:37.303
Oh, that girl, that witch!

01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:18.223
Oh, I know, I know, I know.

01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:24.550
On, baby.

01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:26.519
Oh, sweetheart.

01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:28.588
The mound of Venus.

01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:45.590
I think she's
at a party with friends.

01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:47.782
She's a witch!

01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:51.422
I know she killed my Phil!

01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:52.581
Phil?

01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:53.588
My Phil.

01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:56.630
Yes, my dog!

01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:59.919
Check that office for,
uh, late workers.

01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:02.944
Somebody must know where they went.

01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:04.625
Yeah, she's a horror!

01:11:04.680 --> 01:11:07.943
You've got to find her!

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:08.862
Oh, Mickey.

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:10.106
All right, Mrs. Nasone.

01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:11.864
And you better get
rid of that head.

01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:13.311
I hope they find them.

01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:14.581
Oh!

01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:46.020
What's that?

01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:47.301
Thana!

01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:49.501
- What happened?
- Thana!

01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:51.668
Look out!

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:03.465
Thana!

01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:13.825
Thana!

01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:55.741
No!

01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:35.551
Sister.
