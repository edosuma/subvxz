- Oh, look.
- Common gulls, do you think?

01:27.546 --> 01:30.595
Yes, I would think...
I don't know. Maybe.

01:52.529 --> 01:55.248
You were made for each other, you and Merrilegs.

01:55.365 --> 01:57.333
You're a little beauty, aren't you?

02:08.794 --> 02:09.967
Where did you meet him?

02:10.547 --> 02:12.870
In the pub, not surprisingly.

02:12.896 --> 02:14.497
Eyes front, Dolly.

02:14.551 --> 02:16.148
You've got your clothes on now.

02:16.174 --> 02:17.204
Do stop shivering.

02:17.304 --> 02:20.433
<i>No, not Ad. Your husband?</i>

02:21.308 --> 02:23.402
Oh, him.

02:24.853 --> 02:27.572
In Nottingham. I was 14.

02:27.648 --> 02:30.777
- 14?
- Harold was 17.

02:31.735 --> 02:35.535
And he taught me everything I know about painting.

02:37.741 --> 02:39.709
Oh, Harold.

02:59.638 --> 03:00.962
Well, what about the outbuildings?

03:00.988 --> 03:01.961
Ruins, aren't they?

03:02.057 --> 03:03.684
They could be converted into studios.

03:03.809 --> 03:06.107
There are enough artists on my land already, aren't there?

03:06.269 --> 03:08.477
I think we should be proud of the artists, sir.

03:08.503 --> 03:09.514
They're a great bunch.

03:09.606 --> 03:11.700
What's all this I hear about this Munnings chap?

03:11.775 --> 03:12.801
Not sure what you mean, Colonel.

03:12.827 --> 03:13.723
What do they call him?

03:13.819 --> 03:16.038
Is it AJ? 
There's nothing a bit off about the fella, is there?

03:16.196 --> 03:17.371
No, he's great fun, sir.

03:17.397 --> 03:18.474
Where's he from?

03:18.657 --> 03:19.887
Suffolk-Norfolk way, I think.

03:19.913 --> 03:21.652
He's upset some people in Penzance.

03:21.743 --> 03:24.016
I don't want a cad living on my land, Evans.

03:24.042 --> 03:25.022
Not a cad, is he?

03:25.789 --> 03:27.278
They tell me he's a genius.

03:27.304 --> 03:29.068
Oh, Lord, not another one.

03:37.884 --> 03:39.807
- Gilbert! Give me a hand here!
- AJ!

03:41.930 --> 03:43.807
Quick, grab the bridle!
Grab the bridle!

03:43.932 --> 03:45.605
- Got it!
- Shh. Calm down.

03:45.726 --> 03:48.320
- Come on.
- Keep turning him.

03:48.437 --> 03:49.418
There we are.

03:49.444 --> 03:52.763
Mind you give him a good rubdown there, eh?

03:52.858 --> 03:54.280
Sir.

03:54.401 --> 03:55.584
Who's coming to the party?

03:55.610 --> 03:57.475
Why everyone in Lamorna, of course.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.494
No half measures, then.

04:09.124 --> 04:12.845
Laura? Laura!
Get Gilbert a drink, will you?

04:12.961 --> 04:14.338
Coming up, sir!

04:14.421 --> 04:16.515
And pour one down your husband's neck while you're at it.

04:16.630 --> 04:18.759
Leave Harold alone!

04:18.841 --> 04:20.515
He's all right, aren't you, Knighty?

04:20.635 --> 04:23.104
Joey! Joey, logs, man, logs.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.938
But there may be regimental business in March.

04:27.058 --> 04:29.060
I hope that's not the case. I do.

04:29.186 --> 04:31.021
You're going to stay down here, Gilbert?

04:31.047 --> 04:32.010
You're not leaving?

04:32.063 --> 04:34.316
Well, it depends on the regiment.

04:34.441 --> 04:35.804
But we couldn't get on without you.

04:35.830 --> 04:37.386
That's very sweet of you, Laura...

04:39.196 --> 04:40.692
Aha, I knew that was you.

04:40.718 --> 04:41.710
Not in my house.

04:41.736 --> 04:43.351
Get off her. Get off her.

04:44.993 --> 04:46.002
You been busy, Dolly?

04:46.028 --> 04:47.612
I've never been busier, AJ.

04:47.704 --> 04:49.172
Mm, me next, then, is it?

04:49.372 --> 04:51.372
Why don't you join the queue and take your chances?

04:51.458 --> 04:54.132
- Join the queue...
- I'm sorry, Dolly.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.046
- Go on.
- Go on what?

04:56.171 --> 04:57.846
Do what you promised.

04:57.872 --> 04:59.840
What did I promise?

04:59.841 --> 05:01.843
You know what I'm talking about.

05:02.594 --> 05:04.141
Oh, no, not now.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.022
Right, everyone, quiet, please!

05:06.139 --> 05:08.107
- Oh, no.
- Shh!

05:09.017 --> 05:13.944
I want to hear this piece of lemon...

05:16.233 --> 05:19.032
- ..hiss.
- Sorry.

05:20.403 --> 05:22.405
When I put it on the fire.

05:41.883 --> 05:45.387
"Once upon a midnight dreary,

05:46.721 --> 05:49.270
"while I pondered weak and weary,

06:11.955 --> 06:13.923
Who on earth is that?

06:19.087 --> 06:20.760
- Florence, my God.
- Joey.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.178
What are you doing here?

06:22.299 --> 06:23.236
I asked at the pub.

06:23.262 --> 06:24.543
They said you'd be here.

06:24.634 --> 06:26.602
Everybody,
this is my sister Florence.

06:26.720 --> 06:30.065
- Hello, Florence.
- This is one of your parties?

06:30.181 --> 06:32.229
One of AJ's and he does love a party.

06:33.435 --> 06:35.062
That's Alfred Munnings?

06:35.145 --> 06:37.308
Yes, this is Laura, Laura Knight.

06:37.334 --> 06:39.300
She's a very famous painter.

06:39.399 --> 06:40.488
Oh, yes, very famous.

06:40.514 --> 06:42.223
This is her husband Harold.

06:42.319 --> 06:43.799
- How do you do.
- Lovely to meet you.

06:43.820 --> 06:46.790
This is Dolly. Now, Dolly, she models for us painters.

06:46.907 --> 06:49.251
If they ask nicely.

06:49.326 --> 06:50.794
Hello.

06:50.911 --> 06:53.755
And this is my dearest friend, Captain Gilbert Evans.

06:54.706 --> 06:56.184
How do you do, Miss Carter-Wood.

06:56.210 --> 06:57.826
How do you do, Captain Evans.

06:57.918 --> 06:59.814
Gilbert, please. Come and get warm.

06:59.840 --> 07:01.573
Please, can I take your cloak?

07:01.671 --> 07:02.324
Yes, thank you.

07:02.350 --> 07:03.915
It's very free down here, Flo.

07:03.965 --> 07:04.935
We do what we like.

07:04.961 --> 07:06.084
We say what we like.

07:06.176 --> 07:07.356
So are you a soldier?

07:07.382 --> 07:08.954
Some of the time, yes.

07:09.095 --> 07:11.723
And the rest of time you do what you like and say what you like.

07:11.848 --> 07:13.896
No, the rest of the time, he keeps us all in line.

07:14.643 --> 07:16.737
And you're down here in Cornwall to paint as well?

07:16.853 --> 07:19.572
Yes, I'm joining Joey at his class in Newlyn.

07:19.689 --> 07:22.738
I'll just hang this up and I'll get you a drink. Ah, AJ.

07:22.859 --> 07:25.078
If I may continue...

07:25.153 --> 07:27.372
- Shh.
- I'll start again, shall I?

07:29.574 --> 07:32.953
"Once upon a midnight dreary,

07:33.453 --> 07:37.583
"while I pondered weak and weary,

08:04.818 --> 08:06.411

08:07.862 --> 08:11.036

08:12.826 --> 08:15.420

08:19.332 --> 08:20.897
Oh, Joey, it's perfect.

08:20.923 --> 08:23.032
I can't wait to see the view.

08:23.128 --> 08:24.727
And you know AJ Munnings.

08:24.753 --> 08:26.032
So do you now.

08:26.214 --> 08:27.889
Everybody's talking about him in town.

08:27.915 --> 08:29.368
He has an exhibition coming up.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.345
That poem was amazing, wasn't it?

08:31.371 --> 08:32.538
You thought so?

08:32.595 --> 08:34.438
Oh, yes, didn't you?

08:34.639 --> 08:37.734
Was it really worth all the effort of committing it to memory like that?

08:37.808 --> 08:40.607
- It seemed quite strange.
- Here we are.

08:44.691 --> 08:46.717
I still can't get over it.

08:46.743 --> 08:48.846
You seem fully recovered.

08:50.447 --> 08:53.121
- Did Father let you come?
- What?

08:55.452 --> 08:57.750
No, I just left.

08:57.871 --> 08:59.714
You just left?

09:01.166 --> 09:03.260
I told him what I thought of his Julian.

09:03.376 --> 09:04.423
Ah.

09:05.378 --> 09:06.825
He told me that I was a fool.

09:06.851 --> 09:07.997
I wouldn't do better.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.598
Any girl would be fortunate to marry his precious Julian

09:11.718 --> 09:14.847
and I told him that I wanted to come down here, as far away as possible.

09:14.971 --> 09:17.099
What happened with Julian?

09:17.849 --> 09:20.068
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

09:21.186 --> 09:23.188
Julian does not exist.

09:24.814 --> 09:27.067
Did you break it off?

09:27.150 --> 09:29.015
Not now, Joey, I'm tired.

09:29.041 --> 09:31.055
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

09:31.112 --> 09:33.114
I'm so glad you came.

09:37.035 --> 09:39.037
You're going to love it here.

09:39.704 --> 09:41.877
- Good night.
- Good night.

09:53.468 --> 09:56.267
- What do you make of her, then?
- Of whom?

09:56.346 --> 09:59.316
Come on. 
You know who I'm talking about, the new girl.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.150
I hardly had a chance to speak to her.

10:01.267 --> 10:03.770
I could have sworn I saw you gazing at her.

10:03.895 --> 10:06.865
- Nonsense.
- Very paintable.

10:06.981 --> 10:08.504
Ah, so it's over to you, then.

10:08.530 --> 10:10.306
There'll be a stalking party.

10:10.485 --> 10:11.306
Oh, I'm sure.

10:11.332 --> 10:13.480
Might be a gent she's after.

10:16.157 --> 10:19.457
Remember, whatever I say or do, I'm your friend,

10:19.994 --> 10:22.622
even when I'm a silly bugger.

10:22.747 --> 10:24.369
All right, come on, Gilbert.

10:24.395 --> 10:25.901
I'll beat you this time.

10:33.925 --> 10:38.055
I've been in the rock pools again and I'm just bringing them in,

10:38.138 --> 10:42.063
putting them in the big tank and the little devil stung me.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.462
Gilbert, what a pleasure.

10:43.488 --> 10:44.966
Florence, how are you?

10:45.061 --> 10:47.655
Here he is. Look, Gilbert.

10:47.772 --> 10:49.820
This one here.

10:49.941 --> 10:51.739
- That's extraordinary.
- Yeah.

10:51.860 --> 10:54.659
Beautiful, aren't they?

10:54.779 --> 10:56.577
When is your first class?

10:56.739 --> 10:57.657
Tomorrow at Newlyn.

10:57.683 --> 10:59.517
Joey's going to take me, aren't you?

10:59.576 --> 11:01.169
Yes, of course.

11:01.286 --> 11:04.460
If Father thinks we're wasting his money, it's straight back to London.

11:04.581 --> 11:06.333
None of us would want that.

11:06.457 --> 11:08.710
That's exactly what Mr Munnings said, isn't it?

11:08.918 --> 11:09.883
AJ's been around already?

11:09.909 --> 11:10.911
You just missed him.

11:11.045 --> 11:13.468
He came to see some of Florence's paintings.

11:13.548 --> 11:14.693
I see, of course.

11:14.719 --> 11:16.873
And very impressed he was.

11:16.968 --> 11:19.312
- I'm sure.
- He was just being polite.

11:19.387 --> 11:21.606
When's AJ polite?

11:21.764 --> 11:24.517
So Joey tells me you fought in the South African war.

11:24.684 --> 11:27.278
- Florence.
- What?

11:27.395 --> 11:29.848
You did. Did I say something wrong?

11:29.874 --> 11:31.345
No, not at all.

11:31.441 --> 11:34.991
Do forgive me. 
Joey assured me you all spoke about everything here.

11:35.111 --> 11:38.331
That's what made this place special, that sense of frank discussion.

11:39.282 --> 11:41.284
Absolutely.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.082
Yeah.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.706
Well, drink in the Wink?

11:46.623 --> 11:50.127
- What, now?
- AJ said he was going.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.133
Well, the Wink it is, then.

11:52.212 --> 11:55.214
- Dolly, you'll like this one.
- Try me.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.217
“When Titian mixed his rose madder,

11:57.300 --> 11:59.723
"His model he placed on a ladder.

11:59.844 --> 12:03.394
"Her position to Titian suggested coition,

12:03.514 --> 12:06.267
"so he mounted the ladder and had her!"

12:08.311 --> 12:09.328
Same again, Dolly?

12:09.354 --> 12:11.556
AJ, you're a gent and it's a gin.

12:11.648 --> 12:13.742
- Joey?
- To Omar Khayyam!

12:16.069 --> 12:18.242
If everyone could write like Omar Khayyam.

12:18.363 --> 12:20.866
Who's this Omar Khayyam?

12:20.990 --> 12:22.992
Weren't you educated at all?

12:23.993 --> 12:26.963
No. Not much.

12:27.121 --> 12:30.125
- He does makes lots of references...
- AJ.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.877
Erm...

12:32.001 --> 12:34.095
Who's this Omar, then?

12:34.212 --> 12:36.590
Arab horse thief?

12:36.756 --> 12:40.386
Er, "Rubaiyat" of Omar Khayyam.

12:40.510 --> 12:43.138
It's a poem, translated from the Persian.

12:43.221 --> 12:44.438
Which Persian?

12:47.976 --> 12:49.273
So it's a poem.

12:49.352 --> 12:50.899
Let's hear a bit, then.

12:51.521 --> 12:53.489
- I like a bit of poetry.
- Alfred.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.098
No, stay out of this, Laura.

12:55.124 --> 12:55.975
Well, come on.

12:56.067 --> 12:58.035
- Do you...?
- A couplet.

12:58.152 --> 13:01.656
- Bertie...
- A line? A word?

13:01.823 --> 13:05.168
So you like this Omar, but you don't know a bloody word of his?

13:05.285 --> 13:07.253
- Right, Jory!
- Yes, AJ.

13:07.328 --> 13:11.333
Get me a drink, will you, and I'll give this lot a bit of poetry.

13:11.334 --> 13:13.380
A bit of bloody "Hiawatha".

13:14.419 --> 13:18.344
"Never stoops the soaring vulture

13:18.464 --> 13:21.889
"On his quarry in the desert,

13:23.386 --> 13:27.016
"On the sick or wounded bison, But another vulture, watching

13:27.098 --> 13:29.100
"From his high aerial lookout..."

13:29.183 --> 13:31.151
Florence, I would very much like to paint you.

13:31.227 --> 13:34.322
I was wondering whether you would sit for me.

13:35.732 --> 13:39.077
And when I'm with you, I could pick your brains,

13:39.152 --> 13:42.201
because I came here to learn from you. I want to learn from all of you.

13:42.322 --> 13:43.416
Well, if you wish.

13:43.442 --> 13:45.021
Would you excuse me.

13:48.036 --> 13:50.255
Mightn't it be easier if you asked Dolly?

13:50.330 --> 13:52.207
- Dolly?
- Yes.

13:52.332 --> 13:55.302
No, Dolly's game enough, but she has nothing to hide.

13:56.502 --> 13:59.338
"And filled the silent wigwam..."

13:59.339 --> 14:00.919
Oh, Howard, I'm sorry. I can't.

14:00.945 --> 14:02.117
I've just remembered.

14:02.216 --> 14:04.093
I promised to sit for Mr Munnings.

14:04.177 --> 14:06.430
"Hiawatha could hear a rustle..."

14:06.554 --> 14:09.433
- On a horse.
- On a horse?

14:09.557 --> 14:11.059
<i>Yes.</i>

14:11.184 --> 14:14.484
Well, that's what he does, doesn't he? Horses.

14:14.562 --> 14:16.064
AJ doesn't do women.

14:17.899 --> 14:19.492
Excuse me.

14:20.234 --> 14:24.489
"Felt the cold breath of the night air,

14:25.740 --> 14:27.617
"And for the moment saw the starlight,

14:29.952 --> 14:33.126
"But he could see the ghosts no longer,

14:34.123 --> 14:37.423
"Saw no more the wandering spirits

14:37.502 --> 14:40.096
"From the kingdom of Ponemah,

14:41.089 --> 14:46.687
"From the land of the Hereafter."

14:49.972 --> 14:55.399
And that was by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow

14:55.520 --> 14:59.570
and he is not a fucking Persian.

15:01.818 --> 15:03.695
Well done, AJ. Well done.

15:03.820 --> 15:06.448
I must say that is quite a feat.

15:06.614 --> 15:10.118
Jory, get these gentlemen a drink

15:10.243 --> 15:12.962
and a slice of humble pie.

15:13.079 --> 15:16.458
Well, now, AJ, I was wondering if we could have a little settle up.

15:17.708 --> 15:20.211
- Excuse me.
- I've been totting up here.

15:20.294 --> 15:23.218
And erm... there we are.

15:24.090 --> 15:25.558
Oh, I see.

15:25.675 --> 15:29.430
Well, I can do better than this,
Mr Jory.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.973
- Can you, now?
- Yes, I can.

15:35.143 --> 15:36.986
I'll give you something priceless.

15:43.568 --> 15:45.366
Oh. Oh, dear Lord.

15:47.530 --> 15:49.032
- Is that us?
- It's us.

15:58.875 --> 16:01.424
Well, I suppose I'd better add it to my collection.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.915
I can tell you like it here.

16:33.868 --> 16:36.371
- A man, was it?
- I'm sorry?

16:36.496 --> 16:38.590
Are you escaping from a man?

16:40.291 --> 16:41.338
<i>I was.</i>

16:42.585 --> 16:43.882
Thought as much.

16:45.922 --> 16:47.139
Wait, don't move.

16:50.551 --> 16:52.553
It was my father.

16:52.678 --> 16:54.055
Worries about you, does he?

16:57.391 --> 16:58.914
And I can see why.

16:58.940 --> 17:00.886
What can you see?

17:01.020 --> 17:02.818
A talented girl who wants
what she wants.

17:03.773 --> 17:05.867
And that's worrying, is it?

17:06.733 --> 17:08.486
Hm, for some men.

17:11.071 --> 17:12.164
Not for me.

17:17.328 --> 17:18.875
All right.

17:19.079 --> 17:21.174
Come on. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.884
- Calm down.
- Whoa, calm down, now.

17:25.211 --> 17:27.088
Calm down, calm down, calm down.

17:27.213 --> 17:29.932
That's it. You're such a good girl.

17:32.218 --> 17:33.811
Let's get back to work, eh?

17:34.762 --> 17:35.854
Good girl.

17:38.224 --> 17:40.226
Gilbert.

17:46.607 --> 17:47.699
Gilbert.

17:49.068 --> 17:52.993
Come on. No, that's not it.

17:53.155 --> 17:55.203
Lighter, man. Blast.

17:57.618 --> 17:59.586
Bloody Gilbert.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.378
Would you like me to help you?

18:04.709 --> 18:07.428
- Help me?
- I could make you better.

18:10.381 --> 18:12.133
What's Joey been saying to you?

18:12.300 --> 18:14.394
He's been talking
about me, hasn't he?

18:15.928 --> 18:17.475
Make you a better painter.

18:21.100 --> 18:22.568
Oh, I see.

18:25.104 --> 18:28.358
Lighter, lighter! Blast.

18:32.361 --> 18:33.112
What on earth?

18:33.138 --> 18:34.639
Wait, you can't leave now.

18:34.697 --> 18:37.371
Oh, for God's sake,
get back on the horse, woman.

18:37.491 --> 18:40.165
I have pins and needles
and I have my own work to do.

18:40.286 --> 18:42.755
I can't be on both sides of the easel at once, can I?

18:42.872 --> 18:45.921
Come back tomorrow. Will you?

18:46.876 --> 18:48.469
But I'm on the edge.

19:17.406 --> 19:18.532
What is that?

19:20.701 --> 19:22.578
It's a rabbit.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.664
What's it doing there?

19:26.040 --> 19:27.667
It brings the trout up.

19:27.750 --> 19:28.842
HOW?

19:28.959 --> 19:32.964
Maggots breed inside it, drop down into the stream.

19:33.631 --> 19:35.804
It attracts the bigger fish.
That's all.

19:38.928 --> 19:41.556
What's the matter? 
You're shivering.

19:41.681 --> 19:43.683
Is something wrong?
Here, take this.

19:43.808 --> 19:46.061
Thank you.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.233
- Better?
- Yes.

19:50.648 --> 19:52.821
Will you stay for a bit?

19:52.942 --> 19:54.944
Only if you go on fishing.

19:55.945 --> 19:57.447
All right.

19:57.613 --> 20:00.366
That is if you...
if you don't mind me watching.

20:00.491 --> 20:02.493
There's nothing I'd like more.

20:18.968 --> 20:20.704
What a wonderful walk.

20:20.730 --> 20:22.623
Let's do it again.

20:22.680 --> 20:25.524
- I'd love to.
- Tomorrow morning, then.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.808
Erm, I'm meeting AJ for a lesson.

20:27.834 --> 20:29.095
Ah, lucky man.

20:29.228 --> 20:31.822
You're very loyal to him, aren't you?

20:31.981 --> 20:34.029
I like him.

20:34.942 --> 20:37.491
Whatever he does?

20:37.611 --> 20:39.409
His bark's worse than his bite.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.247
Come on, Doll!

20:43.451 --> 20:45.829
- It's not too bad.
- Joey!

20:45.953 --> 20:48.172
I'm going now!

20:48.330 --> 20:49.281
Then get it on you!

20:49.307 --> 20:50.107
Come on! Here!

20:52.001 --> 20:53.753
I need a place of my own.

20:54.754 --> 20:57.007
You're not going away?

20:57.131 --> 21:00.101
No. No, a... a studio.

21:00.176 --> 21:03.020
However small, somewhere I can work and be alone.

21:03.262 --> 21:05.356
- I'll keep my eye open.
- Would you?

21:05.431 --> 21:07.900
- Of course.
- Come on in, it's lovely!

21:08.017 --> 21:10.566
- Come on, Gilbert.
- Oh, that boy.

21:10.644 --> 21:12.646
Wait here.

21:14.315 --> 21:15.815
On!

21:15.816 --> 21:18.069
Joey! Dolly!

21:19.361 --> 21:21.489
Joey, come in at once!

21:23.574 --> 21:25.372
The tide will drag you out to sea!

21:25.493 --> 21:27.666
Come in, both of you! Dolly!

21:28.579 --> 21:31.628
- Woo!
- Come on, Dolls. Let's go.

21:31.749 --> 21:33.751
Caught red-handed.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.506
Nice out here, isn't it, Captain?

21:38.714 --> 21:41.012
Dolly, the tide is especially dangerous here.

21:41.133 --> 21:42.931
You a prefect at school, were you?

21:43.552 --> 21:45.600
Of course I was.

21:48.808 --> 21:51.357
Oh, hurry up, Dolls.
It's freezing.

21:52.478 --> 21:54.141
Come on, get your clothes on.

21:54.167 --> 21:55.427
All right, then.

23:34.914 --> 23:36.291
Fuck!

23:47.968 --> 23:49.436
AJ!

23:50.721 --> 23:51.813
Ad!

23:54.683 --> 23:55.451
Where were you?

23:55.477 --> 23:57.882
I thought I was sitting for you this morning.

24:08.280 --> 24:10.032
I can't paint, Florence.

24:12.534 --> 24:13.706
Everybody has off days.

24:13.827 --> 24:16.376
Don't talk to me about off days.

24:17.373 --> 24:18.816
I paint. That's what I do.

24:18.842 --> 24:20.117
Nothing else matters.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.007
I see it and I paint it.

24:26.131 --> 24:28.133
I thought you understood that.

24:30.803 --> 24:32.260
Where are you going?

24:32.286 --> 24:34.253
As far away as I can.

24:50.572 --> 24:52.733
- Here we are, ma'am.
- Anything interesting?

24:52.825 --> 24:54.022
It's from Father.

24:54.048 --> 24:56.229
Father? What does it say?

24:59.790 --> 25:02.213
He's coming down.

25:02.334 --> 25:04.837
What on earth is he coming down for?

25:04.962 --> 25:06.162
To spoil the fun.

25:06.188 --> 25:07.740
That's what he does.

25:09.508 --> 25:11.138
He'll miss the main show.

25:11.164 --> 25:12.207
There's no AJ.

25:12.302 --> 25:15.146
Can you imagine how the two of them would get along?

25:16.890 --> 25:17.982
I've got it.

25:18.726 --> 25:20.694
We get Gilbert over.

25:21.645 --> 25:23.989
- That's perfect.
- Gilbert won't let the side down.

25:24.064 --> 25:25.024
We'll ask him now.

25:25.050 --> 25:26.968
I promised I'd sit for Harold.

25:27.067 --> 25:28.694
All right, in demand, are we?

25:29.695 --> 25:33.290
Joey, whatever happens when Father comes, you mustn't lose your nerve.

25:33.407 --> 25:36.581
- Right.
- We're not going home.

25:36.702 --> 25:39.626
Come on, kids. Clear off.

25:39.747 --> 25:41.340
And leave his painting.

25:41.457 --> 25:43.100
Don't touch those paints.

25:43.126 --> 25:44.702
Don't touch the paint!

25:48.005 --> 25:49.632
Beautiful.

25:57.264 --> 25:58.459
Get! Hey, give me that.

25:58.485 --> 26:00.042
Bugger off, you little rats.

26:17.076 --> 26:19.670
Well, how are you both getting on?

26:19.787 --> 26:21.585
We're having great fun, Father.

26:21.705 --> 26:24.049
I meant the art classes.

26:25.209 --> 26:27.758
Well, they're going very well.

26:27.878 --> 26:29.114
They're costing me a fortune.

26:29.140 --> 26:30.247
Anything to show for it?

26:30.339 --> 26:33.593
- More cake, Father?
- Er...

26:33.801 --> 26:36.930
Just a slither, if I may, Florence, thank you.

26:38.097 --> 26:39.474
More cake, Captain Evans?

26:40.265 --> 26:41.437
If I may.

26:42.101 --> 26:46.777
So, Captain Evans, you're with the Monmouthshire Militia?

26:46.897 --> 26:48.865
Yes, Colonel Paynter's regiment, sir.

26:48.982 --> 26:51.280
But he also keeps an eye on all the wayward artists.

26:51.485 --> 26:52.927
Don't you, Captain Evans?

26:52.953 --> 26:54.855
Never lets us out of his sight.

26:54.947 --> 26:58.201
But you're called back regularly for training?

26:58.283 --> 27:01.127
When required, yes, every few months or so.

27:01.245 --> 27:02.545
Very good, very good.

27:02.571 --> 27:04.490
And where were you at school?

27:04.540 --> 27:06.838
- I was at Rugby, sir.
- Rugby...

27:08.919 --> 27:10.887
Very good, so, er...

27:13.715 --> 27:15.388
Who's going to show me round?

27:15.414 --> 27:17.085
Joey said he'd like to.

27:17.136 --> 27:21.141
Gilbert's already asked me for a walk to Mousehole along the cliffs.

27:22.141 --> 27:26.146
Yes, marvellous views along there.

27:28.438 --> 27:30.486
Good, excellent.

27:31.984 --> 27:33.861
Do you ever come up to town, Captain Evans?

27:34.653 --> 27:36.451
The colonel can't spare him, I'm afraid.

27:38.740 --> 27:40.492
Occasionally, yes, sir.

27:41.243 --> 27:44.122
Do call in on us, er, if you do.

27:45.747 --> 27:46.794
Thank you very much.

27:56.466 --> 27:59.345
You were wonderful at tea. Thank you.

27:59.469 --> 28:02.097
- And you were naughty.
- Was I?

28:02.181 --> 28:05.230
- Very naughty.
- Yet I've never felt so good.

28:05.976 --> 28:07.899
You've never looked so good.

28:08.020 --> 28:10.022
Haven't I?

28:10.147 --> 28:12.866
Will you come with me to the races on Saturday?

28:12.983 --> 28:14.826
I'd love to.

28:14.985 --> 28:16.453
And Father will be gone!

29:05.160 --> 29:06.616
Keep them in line. Move them up.

29:06.642 --> 29:07.779
That's it. Steady, now.

29:07.871 --> 29:10.249
Altogether, keep them in line.

29:20.842 --> 29:22.117
Good to see you again.

29:22.143 --> 29:23.416
Good to be back.

29:23.512 --> 29:25.514
- I'll see you later.
- Yes.

29:26.556 --> 29:27.931
Have you missed me, then?

29:27.957 --> 29:29.551
Oh, have you been away?

29:34.356 --> 29:35.549
Have you got it?

29:35.575 --> 29:37.885
I have. Sovereign to win.

29:37.985 --> 29:40.033
And is he a winner, do you think?

29:40.153 --> 29:42.247
- Undoubtedly.
- Are you ready, gentlemen?

29:45.617 --> 29:47.290
Go on, boy!

29:49.538 --> 29:51.461
Go on! Go on!

29:52.708 --> 29:54.710
- Go on!
- Look, he's leading.

29:58.005 --> 30:00.258
- Joey, time for a pint.
- Absolutely.

30:01.508 --> 30:02.591
Be a dear. Dolly?

30:02.617 --> 30:05.037
I don't want to miss the finish.

30:05.137 --> 30:06.046
Don't be silly.

30:06.072 --> 30:07.585
There's plenty of time.

30:13.186 --> 30:15.234
What do you think?

30:15.314 --> 30:17.316
There's no one like him.

30:18.317 --> 30:20.945
Really? No one?

30:21.111 --> 30:23.205
No one.

30:23.280 --> 30:25.282
He's a genius.

Oh, he was doing so well.

31:01.360 --> 31:02.674
Give that to him.

31:02.700 --> 31:04.013
Give that here.

31:08.367 --> 31:11.246
- Tell me something.
- What's that?

31:11.370 --> 31:13.372
Is Laura in love with AJ?

31:13.497 --> 31:15.545
- With AJ? No.
- No?

31:15.665 --> 31:18.088
No, she... loves his work,

31:18.210 --> 31:22.681
but... deep down she's devoted to Harold.

31:22.798 --> 31:25.722
Deep down. It's a lovely phrase.

31:26.760 --> 31:28.728
Do you know who you are deep down?

31:30.305 --> 31:31.431
Yes, I think so.

31:32.182 --> 31:33.775
I wish I did.

31:34.810 --> 31:36.608
And I know what I want.

31:37.729 --> 31:41.734
I That's why I'm lonely

31:41.817 --> 31:45.947
<i>No home at all</i>

31:46.029 --> 31:50.000
<i>I broke her heart, pet</i>

31:50.117 --> 31:54.088
<i>After the ball</i>

31:55.163 --> 31:59.464
<i>After the ball is over</i>

31:59.543 --> 32:02.922
<i>After the break of morn</i>

32:03.046 --> 32:04.423
Morn! Morn!

32:04.548 --> 32:07.643
<i>After the dancers leaving</i>

32:07.759 --> 32:11.605
<i>After the stars are gone</i>

32:11.721 --> 32:16.022
<i>Many a heart is aching</i>

32:16.143 --> 32:20.273
<i>If you could read them all</i>

32:20.397 --> 32:24.823
<i>Many of the hopes that have vanished</i>

32:24.985 --> 32:30.116
<i>After the ball</i>

32:30.240 --> 32:32.538
Oh, very good.

32:32.659 --> 32:34.536
Oh, I wish I could play.

32:34.619 --> 32:36.667
So do I. I...

32:36.788 --> 32:37.631
That was fantastic.

32:37.657 --> 32:38.986
Where did you learn to sing?

32:40.292 --> 32:43.466
It's so beautiful down here, isn't it?

32:43.587 --> 32:45.134
Yes, it is.

32:45.255 --> 32:47.553
It's the most beautiful place I've ever been to.

33:00.020 --> 33:02.364
- Florence.
- Yes.

33:07.694 --> 33:10.664
- I've something I want to ask you.
- Yes.

33:10.780 --> 33:13.704
What on earth are you doing mooning about out here?

33:13.825 --> 33:15.543
We're dancing inside

33:15.660 --> 33:19.756
and only yesterday you said how much you loved dancing.

33:19.831 --> 33:22.300
And I am the best dancer in Lamorna.

33:22.417 --> 33:24.465
Eh, Gilbert? Come on.

33:58.203 --> 33:59.295
Florence!

34:01.122 --> 34:02.294
Florence!

34:07.546 --> 34:09.547
I need you this afternoon.

34:09.672 --> 34:11.194
I'm sorry, I can't. I'm busy.

34:11.219 --> 34:12.371
Busy doing what?

34:12.467 --> 34:13.592
Sketching.

34:13.677 --> 34:15.395
In your bedroom?

34:15.512 --> 34:18.891
Hey. Well, bring it with you.

34:20.391 --> 34:21.049
Well, come on.

34:21.074 --> 34:22.340
What are you waiting for?

34:23.520 --> 34:25.087
Give me ten minutes. I'll be down.

34:25.112 --> 34:26.264
I'll give you five.

34:30.569 --> 34:32.913
- What have you been up to?
- Me?

34:33.071 --> 34:34.947
- Mm.
- Oh, you're not interested.

34:35.114 --> 34:36.321
No, don't stand up.

34:36.347 --> 34:38.440
I am going to draw you now.

34:38.534 --> 34:40.333
No, you're bloody not.

34:40.453 --> 34:44.208
You have told me a number of times that you'd help me.

34:44.331 --> 34:46.755
Yes and I will, once this is finished.

34:47.418 --> 34:48.793
You... you storm off.

34:48.819 --> 34:51.369
You don't tell me where you're going.

34:51.464 --> 34:53.683
You come back and you use me.

34:54.384 --> 34:55.931
It's all you, isn't it?

34:56.094 --> 34:58.472
Well, now it's my turn.

34:59.180 --> 35:00.352
Sit down, please.

35:02.851 --> 35:05.195
Right.

35:05.312 --> 35:07.406
Knees together.

35:10.400 --> 35:11.525
This is not easy for me.

35:11.551 --> 35:13.144
It's not easy for me either.

35:13.236 --> 35:15.739
- I feel like a bloody fool.
- Oh, poor you.

35:20.243 --> 35:24.168
Laura says that you are going to be the most famous artist in England.

35:27.208 --> 35:28.926
No, she'll be the famous one.

35:29.419 --> 35:30.796
Energy of six.

35:30.920 --> 35:32.513
But she's a woman.

35:33.465 --> 35:35.012
Is she?

35:36.384 --> 35:37.144
That's very rude.

35:37.170 --> 35:38.912
You shouldn't have laughed, then.

35:42.932 --> 35:45.731
I think I saw your father the other day in the lane.

35:46.811 --> 35:49.030
Not easy to miss, is he, Mr Carter-Wood?

35:49.189 --> 35:50.736
Nor are you.

35:50.857 --> 35:54.361
Yes, a different breed, though.

35:55.487 --> 35:56.830
Different stable.

35:57.656 --> 35:59.469
Quite a different class.

35:59.495 --> 36:01.231
Does that matter?

36:01.326 --> 36:02.669
Does it to you?

36:04.663 --> 36:07.462
No. No, it doesn't.

36:08.333 --> 36:09.960
Oh, come on, are you feeling brave yet?

36:13.880 --> 36:15.882
I'm not sure what I'm feeling.

36:20.553 --> 36:22.555
Yes, all right, you may look.

36:22.681 --> 36:25.685
And here is Mr AJ Munnings.

36:28.603 --> 36:31.447
- It's a rabbit.
- So it is.

36:32.065 --> 36:33.863
There's more to you than meets the eye.

36:35.318 --> 36:37.116
Is there?

36:38.071 --> 36:39.618
Look, take this section here.

36:41.199 --> 36:43.472
Just here. Come on. Come on, girl.

36:43.498 --> 36:45.570
A little bit more. That's it.

36:45.662 --> 36:47.664
Good girl. Good.

37:02.095 --> 37:04.143
Dodger, here.

37:05.265 --> 37:06.892
Oh.

37:09.018 --> 37:10.235
Ah.

37:34.461 --> 37:36.088
May I have a look?

37:37.005 --> 37:38.382
Of course.

37:49.559 --> 37:51.561
Thank you, Mr Munnings.

38:40.443 --> 38:43.322
You have to be daring and bold.

38:43.446 --> 38:46.700
Layer the paints out how you feel they should be layered.

38:46.825 --> 38:49.544
Just do as you feel just as long as you feel it.

38:49.661 --> 38:52.835
Paint like that or like this.

38:54.582 --> 38:56.255
Like Laura?

38:56.835 --> 38:57.882
No.

38:58.545 --> 39:00.764
- Like you?
- Yes.

39:02.340 --> 39:08.564
Do not under any circumstances paint like this.

39:16.229 --> 39:19.358
Because that is Piss-casso, that is.

39:19.482 --> 39:22.110
- That is piss.
- We wouldn't want that, would we?

39:22.277 --> 39:25.675
No, we would not that, so be bold.

39:25.701 --> 39:27.399
Be... be brave.

39:27.532 --> 39:29.660
Dive in at the deep end.

39:29.784 --> 39:30.876
That's art.

39:32.871 --> 39:34.873
Come here.

39:38.001 --> 39:40.595
Look at me. Stay there.

39:44.465 --> 39:45.557
Look at me.

39:50.763 --> 39:54.142
Because I will bring you alive

39:56.019 --> 39:59.899
And I will capture you... forever.

40:02.150 --> 40:04.744
Years from now they'll look at you...

40:08.823 --> 40:11.542
...and they'll know exactly what I was thinking.

40:14.746 --> 40:16.919
You and I are getting on rather nicely.

40:17.040 --> 40:18.917
- You think so?
- Yes, very nicely.

40:19.876 --> 40:21.878
Does that surprise you?

40:23.796 --> 40:25.423
You civilise me.

40:25.548 --> 40:27.971
Is that what you want, Mr Munnings, to be civilised?

40:28.092 --> 40:29.890
Yes, Miss Carter-Wood.

40:32.096 --> 40:33.268
Is that all you want?

40:35.058 --> 40:36.275
No.

40:38.853 --> 40:40.526
So I'm going to ask you something.

40:42.565 --> 40:44.784
- Are you?
- Just once.

40:45.777 --> 40:47.029
You are?

40:49.322 --> 40:50.494
Will you marry me?

40:58.247 --> 41:01.501
- Yes. Yes, I will.
- I knew you would.

41:01.626 --> 41:06.678
I knew you would. 
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes! Yes!

41:06.798 --> 41:08.766
Oh.

41:12.345 --> 41:13.938
- Laura.
- Gilbert.

41:14.013 --> 41:15.981
You won't believe what I have to tell you.

41:15.982 --> 41:17.146
What is it?

41:18.017 --> 41:20.145
So you haven't heard.

41:22.271 --> 41:23.491
AJ has just called round.

41:23.517 --> 41:25.175
Really? What's he up to now?

41:25.316 --> 41:26.818
They're engaged.

41:28.152 --> 41:29.995
Who? Who's engaged?

41:30.989 --> 41:32.912
Florence and AJ.

41:41.833 --> 41:43.335
Right.

41:46.713 --> 41:48.511
Well, thank you for telling me.

41:48.631 --> 41:50.008
I'm so sorry.

41:51.092 --> 41:53.595
We both are.

41:53.720 --> 41:55.722
You'll come and see us, won't you?

41:56.973 --> 41:58.975
Yes, I expect so.

42:47.940 --> 42:49.362
Mr Munnings.

42:50.818 --> 42:52.482
Yes, that's me.

42:52.508 --> 42:55.724
Well, where is the old boy?

42:55.823 --> 42:57.871
Mr Carter-Wood is in the drawing room, sir.

42:57.992 --> 42:59.244
Very good.

43:00.912 --> 43:02.481
Ah, good afternoon.

43:02.507 --> 43:04.157
How do you do.

43:04.332 --> 43:04.881
How do you do.

43:04.907 --> 43:06.200
A long old journey for you.

43:06.292 --> 43:07.832
No, no, I like to be on the move.

43:07.858 --> 43:09.070
Plenty to catch the eye.

43:10.838 --> 43:12.840
Do sit down.

43:20.348 --> 43:24.023
Missed you, it seems, when I was down in Lamorna.

43:24.143 --> 43:25.235
Yes,

43:25.686 --> 43:28.610
out and about, doing what I do.

43:31.067 --> 43:32.055
Some tea, I thought.

43:32.081 --> 43:33.265
I thought maybe...

43:33.361 --> 43:35.705
Yes, tea, I think.

43:38.199 --> 43:40.873
In my experience, I have to say,

43:41.911 --> 43:45.461
artists are an irresponsible bunch, who often fail to provide

43:45.623 --> 43:48.547
a proper home for themselves, let alone a wife and family.

43:48.668 --> 43:51.421
Yes, that does sound like us.

43:53.005 --> 43:56.305
My daughter has not been short of suitors, Mr Munnings.

43:56.467 --> 43:57.537
I should think not.

43:57.563 --> 43:58.745
And as for you,

43:59.178 --> 44:01.727
as a token of your intent

44:01.806 --> 44:05.276
and before we can discuss any serious arrangements,

44:05.351 --> 44:06.944
I would expect you

44:07.019 --> 44:09.488
to earn 1,000 guineas a year.

44:14.318 --> 44:15.410
Done.

44:16.487 --> 44:17.784
I do already.

44:19.031 --> 44:21.500
Do you? Oh, of course.

44:21.576 --> 44:25.206
But you know, the most important thing

44:25.329 --> 44:27.502
is that you make her happy.

44:27.665 --> 44:29.383
Mm?

44:29.500 --> 44:30.922
Of course.

44:32.336 --> 44:34.338
Cheerio.

44:38.509 --> 44:39.681
Are you happy?

44:41.721 --> 44:43.439
Very.

44:44.182 --> 44:46.230
I should think so.

44:49.770 --> 44:51.772
Have you seen Gilbert lately?

44:53.107 --> 44:54.359
Only from a distance.

44:54.483 --> 44:56.235
He's stopped coming to the pub.

44:59.488 --> 45:01.206
Perhaps he has a lot to do.

45:02.825 --> 45:05.999
He did write me the most lovely letter congratulating us.

45:06.120 --> 45:07.918
Always the gent is our Gilbert.

45:10.917 --> 45:12.590
Oh, come on. That's enough of that.

45:12.710 --> 45:14.132
Let's have a look.

45:51.457 --> 45:55.303
To the most beautiful girl in the whole world!

45:59.131 --> 46:01.179
Second, second most beautiful.

46:01.259 --> 46:03.182
Congratulations.

46:03.261 --> 46:05.605
To the love birds.

46:05.763 --> 46:07.982
What do you think he sees in her?

46:09.267 --> 46:11.679
What do you see in him?

46:11.705 --> 46:14.640
He's fun, Harold. Fun.

46:14.772 --> 46:16.900
You'll be saying he's a force of nature next.

46:17.400 --> 46:19.823
Perhaps she thinks she'll change him.

46:19.902 --> 46:23.998
- Fat chance.
- Some girls are like that.

46:24.115 --> 46:26.083
Before they're married.

46:28.577 --> 46:30.170
Knighty!

46:30.246 --> 46:31.589
Evening.

46:31.706 --> 46:33.925
- You seen Florence's new work?
- I have.

46:34.083 --> 46:36.131
Howard has been very encouraging.

46:36.252 --> 46:39.256
- Do you like it?
- I do. I do.

46:39.338 --> 46:40.490
Bolder, more striking.

46:40.516 --> 46:42.663
Yes, as long as she takes her time.

46:42.717 --> 46:44.316
No, no, no, no, Knighty.

46:44.342 --> 46:46.872
Strike while the iron's hot, Harold.

46:47.805 --> 46:50.900
That's what Florence and I do, isn't it, mm?

46:51.017 --> 46:53.111
Ah, the old boy.

46:53.185 --> 46:56.314
Gilbert, old boy, haven't seen you in a while.

46:57.231 --> 46:58.369
Terribly busy spell.

46:58.395 --> 47:00.100
You know how the colonel is.

47:03.321 --> 47:04.970
I've been up to London.

47:04.996 --> 47:07.647
Yes? Another exhibition, is it?

47:07.742 --> 47:08.924
No, I wish it was.

47:08.950 --> 47:10.065
Old Carter-Wood.

47:11.120 --> 47:12.747
Prospects, all that nonsense.

47:14.540 --> 47:16.542
How did you find him?

47:17.668 --> 47:20.137
I found him a silly old bugger.

47:22.048 --> 47:25.177
There they are, the love birds.

48:18.979 --> 48:21.198
I'm only resting my eyes.

48:27.029 --> 48:28.497
Please do carry on.

48:35.704 --> 48:37.297
May I ask you something?

48:39.041 --> 48:40.839
Of course.

48:41.001 --> 48:44.847
When you're painting, you often hit the canvas quite hard.

48:45.673 --> 48:47.767
It's so different to Laura and Harold

48:47.842 --> 48:51.346
and the technique that they use to apply paint. I...

48:51.429 --> 48:54.148
- It often looks quite er...
- What?

48:55.182 --> 48:58.812
- Clumsy?
- No, not clumsy at all.

48:59.770 --> 49:01.693
- I was just wondering...
- Just wondering?

49:04.066 --> 49:06.034
Just wondering, were you?

49:10.030 --> 49:12.283
You'd better just take a bloody good look.

49:12.408 --> 49:13.711
Look at my right eye.

49:13.737 --> 49:14.481
Do you see?

49:14.577 --> 49:16.545
- Look at my right eye. Look.
- I'm looking.

49:17.997 --> 49:20.466
And the reason for this, my dear Florence,

49:20.583 --> 49:23.837
the reason for this clumsiness, my dear Miss Carter-Wood,

49:24.003 --> 49:27.177
is that I'm completely blind in my right eye.

49:28.299 --> 49:32.554
Blinded as a boy, by a blackthorn, chasing a bloody, silly dog.

49:32.678 --> 49:35.056
And that is why this...

49:36.307 --> 49:40.437
...bumps into that.

50:09.089 --> 50:11.137
Flo, come on. Hey.

50:14.553 --> 50:19.810
It's a big change ahead of you...
and it's a big step.

50:22.019 --> 50:23.737
But he's a great man AJ.

50:25.940 --> 50:27.283
He's going to be famous.

50:28.526 --> 50:31.405
Yes. You're right.

50:32.321 --> 50:34.369
Of course you're right.

50:34.490 --> 50:35.582
Yes?

50:37.076 --> 50:38.453
Hey.

50:41.163 --> 50:43.131
All right.

50:59.682 --> 51:00.934
Any luck?

51:03.435 --> 51:04.652
Not yet.

51:05.688 --> 51:08.407
I don't suppose there's any news on my hut.

51:08.983 --> 51:12.078
Surely once you're married, you'll have everything you need.

51:13.153 --> 51:15.906
No, I still need a place of my own.

51:18.617 --> 51:19.960
Do you?

51:20.119 --> 51:22.793
Yes. Somewhere that I can be away from everybody else.

51:22.913 --> 51:25.382
I'll have a word with the colonel when I get back.

51:25.499 --> 51:27.422
Back? From where?

51:27.501 --> 51:29.503
I'm wanted for a training exercise.

51:30.754 --> 51:32.802
You won't miss the wedding, though, will you?

51:32.923 --> 51:34.470
When is it, exactly?

51:36.844 --> 51:38.471
Two weeks from Saturday.

51:39.179 --> 51:40.277
Two weeks Saturday?

51:40.303 --> 51:42.208
You'll be there, won't you?

51:45.311 --> 51:46.563
Please.

52:25.559 --> 52:27.402
Fancy a drink?

52:27.561 --> 52:28.778
Now?

52:30.022 --> 52:32.491
- Can I come in or was I...
- No, please do.

52:42.910 --> 52:45.663
Bit of a strange request, to tell you the truth.

52:45.746 --> 52:47.714
Sit down.

52:54.088 --> 52:58.184
I have to go up to London early, a few things to do, this and that.

52:59.301 --> 53:02.225
And one way or another, I won't be back before the wedding.

53:04.223 --> 53:06.225
And it's soon, I hear.

53:09.186 --> 53:11.188
Mm, the point is...

53:11.939 --> 53:14.692
...Florence and I would like you to accompany her to London.

53:14.775 --> 53:15.822
Me?

53:18.570 --> 53:19.442
What about Joey?

53:19.468 --> 53:20.939
No, it has to be you.

53:21.865 --> 53:23.867
I think she needs you with her.

53:26.537 --> 53:28.681
You mean a great deal to me, Gilbert.

53:28.707 --> 53:30.908
You mean a great deal to both of us.

53:31.041 --> 53:32.258
You know that.

53:33.711 --> 53:35.554
You do realise what you're asking me?

53:35.671 --> 53:37.093
Yes, of course I do.

53:40.551 --> 53:41.768
We need your help.

53:46.223 --> 53:48.225
All right.

53:49.810 --> 53:50.982
Top man.

54:06.243 --> 54:07.711
Morning.

54:11.457 --> 54:13.380
- Florence.
- I know what you're thinking.

54:13.500 --> 54:16.629
I know what you're going to say, but please don't.

54:16.754 --> 54:17.910
Come on! Come on!

54:17.936 --> 54:19.908
None of this mooning about.

54:20.048 --> 54:23.097
Plenty to see in here.
Plenty to see.

54:23.302 --> 54:25.304
One thing in particular.

54:25.763 --> 54:28.482
What would Constable make of this lot, eh?

54:29.475 --> 54:33.571
I cannot believe that I've dreaded rejection from this bunch of pansies.

54:34.730 --> 54:36.778
- I rather like this one.
- Huh?

54:36.857 --> 54:38.279
It has something.

54:38.400 --> 54:39.777
You do, do you?

54:39.902 --> 54:42.325
Yes, the blues and reds, I think they work.

54:43.363 --> 54:45.741
I'd leave the art to the artists if I were you, my love.

54:49.953 --> 54:52.206
I've seen better work in a Cornish urinal.

54:52.414 --> 54:54.752
And this is why you're here.

54:54.778 --> 54:57.366
May I present "Morning Ride".

55:18.816 --> 55:20.159
What do you think?

55:21.819 --> 55:22.991
Is it me?

55:24.780 --> 55:25.997
Well, it's a picture of you.

55:26.114 --> 55:27.787
What about the other one?

55:28.242 --> 55:30.415
Yes, he has caught them, hasn't he?

55:30.536 --> 55:32.504
No, I mean the gypsy woman.

55:32.621 --> 55:34.794
I hadn't noticed her.

55:34.873 --> 55:37.126
Well, have a good look...

55:38.085 --> 55:39.507
...because she...

55:40.921 --> 55:43.845
because that is one of his as well.

55:46.468 --> 55:49.392
- And Dolly.
- Dolly?

55:49.513 --> 55:53.393
You didn't know? You're his friend and you didn't know.

55:53.517 --> 55:55.019
No, not Dolly, I doubt they...

55:55.143 --> 55:59.614
Because now the whole world knows about AJ and his women,

56:00.816 --> 56:02.659
of whom I am one.

56:05.571 --> 56:07.073
Then why...?

56:08.866 --> 56:09.992
Why?

56:12.286 --> 56:14.914
Why am I happy one day and bored the next?

56:17.165 --> 56:19.759
I can't begin to account for it, can you?

56:21.253 --> 56:25.099
It's all so... unaccountable.

56:28.218 --> 56:33.566
It is a strange feeling, having given oneself away so lightly.

56:35.934 --> 56:37.060
Lightly?

56:39.271 --> 56:40.568
But then...

56:42.983 --> 56:44.985
...AJ is a genius.

56:46.153 --> 56:48.201
And there's no one else in the world like him.

56:52.034 --> 56:53.536
And he loves me.

56:54.786 --> 56:57.960
I'll ask him to take that down and he will.

57:00.167 --> 57:01.635
Excuse me.

57:02.961 --> 57:04.087
A quick word.

57:05.964 --> 57:08.262
I'm not going to do it tomorrow.

57:09.843 --> 57:12.016
- Oh, you're not?
- No.

57:14.473 --> 57:16.475
But you will be there?

57:20.103 --> 57:22.151
I don't know.

57:22.272 --> 57:24.070
Oh.

57:25.108 --> 57:27.110
But I...

57:27.194 --> 57:28.741
I'm sure Joey will step in.

57:31.865 --> 57:33.287
UP '10 you.

58:20.247 --> 58:22.841
People at the back, a little bit in, thank you very much.

58:22.958 --> 58:25.816
AJ, if you love me, take it down.

58:25.842 --> 58:27.659
Take what down?

58:27.713 --> 58:29.807
AJ, I meant what I said.

58:30.841 --> 58:31.534
Take it down.

58:31.560 --> 58:33.210
If you love me, take it down.

58:34.177 --> 58:36.963
My portrait? My portrait of you?

58:36.989 --> 58:38.207
Are you mad?

58:38.306 --> 58:42.982
No, I'm not.
 Leave your other women up there, but take me down.

58:48.400 --> 58:52.951
Well, friends, my Suffolk friends...

58:54.698 --> 58:56.746
- Sons of the soil.
- Yeah!

58:56.825 --> 58:59.419
And my... Cornish friends.

59:02.330 --> 59:06.301
My Cornish family in a manner of speaking,

59:06.418 --> 59:08.420
who see the world as I do,

59:08.587 --> 59:10.806
who capture the world as it passes...

59:11.965 --> 59:15.344
...who see the sparkle of the sea,

59:15.469 --> 59:17.813
or the shimmering coat of a horse.

59:18.805 --> 59:21.558
And the light of a beauty on a lovely day.

59:21.683 --> 59:22.855
Hear, hear.

59:23.894 --> 59:26.818
And what a beauty she is.

59:26.938 --> 59:29.361
Hear, hear.

59:29.483 --> 59:31.577
I'm truly a very lucky man,

59:32.277 --> 59:35.372
because I get to see this wonderful woman

59:35.447 --> 59:39.077
for the rest of my life, but if you want to see Florence

59:39.659 --> 59:41.127
you don't have to go to Florence.

59:42.454 --> 59:44.422
You don't even have to go to Paris.

59:46.041 --> 59:48.419
If you want to see this beautiful woman,

59:48.585 --> 59:51.054
captured for all time,

59:51.129 --> 59:54.008
all you need do is go to the Royal Academy.

59:55.258 --> 59:58.888
Yes, go directly to room nine.

59:59.012 --> 01:00:01.606
The rest is a load of old nonsense in my opinion.

01:00:03.391 --> 01:00:05.769
And go and see my beautiful wife.

01:00:08.396 --> 01:00:10.615
I'd like to raise a glass

01:00:10.732 --> 01:00:14.154
and toast Mrs AJ Munnings.

01:00:17.155 --> 01:00:20.534
To Mrs Munnings.

- To you, Gilbert.
- Cheers.

01:02:24.783 --> 01:02:26.376
I say-

01:02:30.247 --> 01:02:31.965
I'm not interrupting anything.

01:02:36.670 --> 01:02:38.798
Florence!

01:02:40.257 --> 01:02:42.259
Florence!

01:02:45.428 --> 01:02:47.476
Call a doctor! Florence?

01:02:47.597 --> 01:02:49.599
Did she fall?

01:03:10.161 --> 01:03:14.007
<i>Where and when she got the poison I do not know.</i>

01:03:15.208 --> 01:03:19.429
<i>They took her to the London Hospital and, thank God, saved her life.</i>

01:03:22.382 --> 01:03:24.976
<i>Now they're coming back to Lamorna</i>

01:03:25.093 --> 01:03:26.686
<i>and staying here...</i>

01:03:27.846 --> 01:03:29.848
<i>...at the hotel.</i>

01:03:33.310 --> 01:03:34.562
Gilbert...

01:03:34.686 --> 01:03:37.030
Gilbert.

01:03:38.064 --> 01:03:40.066
Good to see you, old boy.

01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:45.242
What's for dinner, hmm?

01:03:46.406 --> 01:03:47.828
Come on.

01:03:47.949 --> 01:03:50.384
You heard Joey's staying in London?

01:03:50.410 --> 01:03:52.775
Yes, very sudden, wasn't it?

01:03:52.912 --> 01:03:55.040
No appeal, I'm afraid. Father was adamant.

01:03:55.874 --> 01:03:59.094
He preferred life to art, didn't he, our Joey?

01:03:59.210 --> 01:04:00.439
What exactly do you mean?

01:04:00.465 --> 01:04:01.988
He preferred life to art.

01:04:03.089 --> 01:04:05.057
Nothing wrong with that.

01:04:06.009 --> 01:04:07.511
Preferred Dolly to daubing.

01:04:08.928 --> 01:04:11.226
So what's he up to now?

01:04:11.348 --> 01:04:13.225
At it hammer and tongs, I imagine.

01:04:14.351 --> 01:04:16.945
You can hardly blame him... Dolly.

01:04:19.230 --> 01:04:21.949
Time for a drink, I think.
Gilbert?

01:04:23.234 --> 01:04:24.861
Yes, thought as much.

01:04:25.779 --> 01:04:27.497
Mrs Jory!

01:04:28.239 --> 01:04:30.662
He insisted on coming back straightaway.

01:04:32.077 --> 01:04:33.124
I'm sorry?

01:04:33.787 --> 01:04:36.256
He seems on top form when you're near.

01:04:37.207 --> 01:04:38.959
He wanted you to come back here?

01:04:39.084 --> 01:04:40.176
Yes.

01:04:41.002 --> 01:04:43.380
And... and you had no choice?

01:04:44.047 --> 01:04:45.765
I had a choice.

01:04:48.468 --> 01:04:51.142
As my father would say, I've made my bed.

01:04:51.888 --> 01:04:54.061
Now it seems as though I must lie on it...

01:04:55.475 --> 01:04:57.477
and in it.

01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:02.732
So you'll still want that studio, then?

01:05:03.817 --> 01:05:05.819
More than anything in the world.

01:05:29.551 --> 01:05:31.553
It's good to see him, though.

01:05:32.846 --> 01:05:33.938
Very.

01:05:37.183 --> 01:05:38.435
Good old Gilbert.

01:05:45.525 --> 01:05:47.573
It feels better being here.

01:05:49.237 --> 01:05:52.241
Yes, I think it will be better, for both of us.

01:05:55.326 --> 01:05:57.328
Yes, I thought it would have...

01:05:59.164 --> 01:06:01.337
...pleased you.

01:06:01.458 --> 01:06:03.085
It does.

01:06:06.963 --> 01:06:08.965
You could always talk to Laura...

01:06:10.633 --> 01:06:12.476
...about things.

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:15.393
You know, woman to woman and all.

01:06:45.168 --> 01:06:47.591
- It's perfect.
- There's a few things need doing.

01:06:47.754 --> 01:06:49.927
No, it's perfect.

01:06:55.386 --> 01:06:58.139
Somebody else has moved into the cottage.

01:07:30.088 --> 01:07:32.090
Thank you so much.

01:07:32.882 --> 01:07:34.475
I'm glad you like it.

01:07:35.176 --> 01:07:36.555
I'm going to fetch my things.

01:07:36.581 --> 01:07:37.579
Will you wait here?

01:07:37.637 --> 01:07:38.763
What, now?

01:07:38.888 --> 01:07:41.607
- Yes, will you wait for me?
- Of course.

01:08:02.912 --> 01:08:04.960
- Morning, AJ.
- Morning.

01:08:36.194 --> 01:08:37.412
Ah.

01:08:49.917 --> 01:08:51.260
AJ.

01:08:52.712 --> 01:08:53.884
You're looking well.

01:08:56.006 --> 01:08:57.224
Roses in your cheeks.

01:08:58.801 --> 01:09:01.770
Yes, you are looking well.

01:09:02.639 --> 01:09:04.015
Am I?

01:09:04.932 --> 01:09:06.184
Suits you.

01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:08.528
You should get out more.

01:09:11.522 --> 01:09:14.492
I am. I'm going now in fact.

01:09:16.194 --> 01:09:18.367
- Going where?
- Don't.

01:09:22.075 --> 01:09:23.372
Come on.

01:09:24.952 --> 01:09:26.625
Let's be seeing you.

01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:30.750
- All of you.
- AJ, not now.

01:09:32.919 --> 01:09:34.386
So when is now?

01:09:36.171 --> 01:09:40.678
Not in the day, not in the night, not this week, not next week,

01:09:40.843 --> 01:09:42.890
not sometimes, not ever.

01:09:43.011 --> 01:09:45.265
- Just not now.
- Yes now!

01:09:46.474 --> 01:09:48.290
Go on. Try that again.

01:09:48.316 --> 01:09:49.719
Try that again.

01:09:52.814 --> 01:09:57.285
Why don't you do what you bloody well should do?

01:10:03.658 --> 01:10:05.331
Ow!

01:10:07.286 --> 01:10:09.038
Aow!

01:10:09.205 --> 01:10:10.422
Don't you dare.

01:10:10.498 --> 01:10:11.841
I'm not your gypsy!

01:10:11.958 --> 01:10:14.552
- No.
- And I'm not Dolly!

01:10:14.627 --> 01:10:15.970
You're damn right you're not.

01:10:25.054 --> 01:10:27.648
Florence, what is it?

01:10:27.724 --> 01:10:30.068
No, don't touch me!

01:10:31.394 --> 01:10:33.488
It's all right. It's all right.

01:11:47.887 --> 01:11:49.889
I just wanted to say...

01:11:56.938 --> 01:11:59.157
I just wanted to say that she's told me.

01:12:00.817 --> 01:12:01.943
Told you?

01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:05.663
Told you what?

01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:07.157
About the hut.

01:12:08.908 --> 01:12:10.910
- Wherever it is.
- Oh, it's nothing.

01:12:12.495 --> 01:12:16.841
I'm happy to do it for her, for you, for both of you.

01:12:17.917 --> 01:12:20.545
It's been made crystal clear to me that it's out of bounds.

01:12:24.799 --> 01:12:28.178
Come to think of it, to tell you the truth, quite a bit is out of bounds.

01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:35.063
- Sit down, AJ.
- I don't want to sit down.

01:12:39.564 --> 01:12:41.441
It used to be so easy, didn't it?

01:12:44.944 --> 01:12:47.072
Paint,

01:12:47.196 --> 01:12:49.164
have a drink...

01:12:49.907 --> 01:12:54.162
...ride, everything full tilt.

01:12:58.416 --> 01:13:00.418
But this...

01:13:03.754 --> 01:13:05.756
God, this beats me.

01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:13.894
The whole fucking business.

01:13:33.492 --> 01:13:34.914
Dodge!

01:13:36.621 --> 01:13:39.249
Morning, ladies. Morning, AJ.

01:13:57.516 --> 01:13:58.642
Thank you.

01:13:59.810 --> 01:14:01.812
- Morning.
- Good morning.

01:14:02.813 --> 01:14:04.986
Oh, I've just seen old Harold in his car.

01:14:05.983 --> 01:14:07.485
Exciting, isn't it?

01:14:08.110 --> 01:14:09.612
Is it?

01:14:09.737 --> 01:14:11.159
Stink of petrol.

01:14:12.657 --> 01:14:14.205
Is the stink of petrol exciting?

01:14:14.231 --> 01:14:15.777
All I meant was that er...

01:14:15.868 --> 01:14:17.336
The hunt is exciting.

01:14:18.245 --> 01:14:20.498
The smell of a horse, that's exciting.

01:14:21.499 --> 01:14:24.127
Besides, he never goes anywhere, does he?

01:14:24.293 --> 01:14:26.091
Runs around after Laura.

01:14:26.212 --> 01:14:27.964
Perhaps that is because he loves her.

01:14:32.551 --> 01:14:33.848
Is that what you want, is it?

01:14:35.554 --> 01:14:38.353
Errand boy? Lap dog?

01:14:44.772 --> 01:14:48.151
I have applied for a position in Africa, surveying.

01:14:49.694 --> 01:14:51.571
I'll be hearing within the month.

01:14:51.988 --> 01:14:53.126
Not back to South Africa?

01:14:53.152 --> 01:14:54.516
You're not going back there?

01:14:54.657 --> 01:14:56.910
- It's West Africa, Nigeria.
- Nigeria?

01:14:57.994 --> 01:15:00.042
But for how long?

01:15:00.162 --> 01:15:01.152
I might not get it.

01:15:01.178 --> 01:15:02.531
How long, she asked?

01:15:04.792 --> 01:15:06.260
Three years.

01:15:08.170 --> 01:15:10.798
Jumping off to the jungle.

01:15:10.923 --> 01:15:12.800
Fuck Africa. I need you here.

01:15:12.883 --> 01:15:13.675
She needs you here.

01:15:13.701 --> 01:15:14.910
Some bloody friend you are.

01:15:15.011 --> 01:15:16.354
- AJ...
- And talking of a friend,

01:15:16.554 --> 01:15:19.683
I'd like to offer you a bit of advice because I've seen something of life.

01:15:19.807 --> 01:15:22.060
You've seen a little bit, but you don't know what you're talking about.

01:15:22.143 --> 01:15:26.319
AJ, do you know what we did in South Africa when we were starving?

01:15:26.439 --> 01:15:28.988
No breakfast like this, no breakfast at all, no lunch.

01:15:29.108 --> 01:15:30.237
No dinner, no food.

01:15:30.263 --> 01:15:31.807
Do you know what we did?

01:15:31.902 --> 01:15:33.241
You like horses, don't you, AJ?

01:15:33.267 --> 01:15:34.476
You love them. We both do.

01:15:34.613 --> 01:15:36.008
Well, we killed them.

01:15:36.034 --> 01:15:38.359
We beheaded them, we skinned them

01:15:38.451 --> 01:15:41.045
and we boiled them into soup, horse soup.

01:15:44.081 --> 01:15:47.631
Horse soup, so do not talk to me about what you have seen.

01:15:47.752 --> 01:15:50.255
Do not talk to me about petrol and, above all,

01:15:50.337 --> 01:15:53.261
do not talk to me about art and life!

01:16:29.877 --> 01:16:31.971
Stay where you are.

01:16:34.381 --> 01:16:36.099
Don't move.

01:16:39.345 --> 01:16:41.347
Stay exactly as you are forever.

01:16:49.063 --> 01:16:51.316
You already have the letter, haven't you?

01:16:53.734 --> 01:16:55.156
Yes.

01:16:55.277 --> 01:16:57.279
And you're going to accept?

01:16:58.280 --> 01:16:59.873
I must.

01:17:02.660 --> 01:17:03.957
Hm.

01:17:05.246 --> 01:17:07.220
Howard says there may be another war.

01:17:07.246 --> 01:17:08.525
What will you do then?

01:17:08.624 --> 01:17:11.047
I'll join my regiment if I have to.

01:17:49.582 --> 01:17:51.084
There's no drink here, AJ.

01:17:52.042 --> 01:17:53.168
You know.

01:17:54.295 --> 01:17:56.969
He called in, yes.

01:17:59.216 --> 01:18:02.186
Joey gone, Dolly gone.

01:18:02.845 --> 01:18:07.225
Gilbert... going.

01:18:07.349 --> 01:18:09.147
Going.

01:18:11.937 --> 01:18:13.484
Gone.

01:18:13.606 --> 01:18:15.108
Yes.

01:18:16.692 --> 01:18:18.285
They're all gone.

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:20.909
You'd better sit down for a moment.

01:18:23.490 --> 01:18:26.835
Friends, one sees how it ends.

01:18:29.455 --> 01:18:31.207
"A woman looks,

01:18:32.333 --> 01:18:34.381
"Or a man lies.

01:18:35.961 --> 01:18:37.838
"And the pleasant brooks,

01:18:38.756 --> 01:18:41.179
"And the quiet skies,

01:18:43.260 --> 01:18:45.137
"Ruined with brawling,

01:18:45.221 --> 01:18:47.223
"And caterwauling,

01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:50.358
"Enchant no more,

01:18:51.769 --> 01:18:53.988
"As they did before,

01:18:56.106 --> 01:18:58.529
"And so it ends,

01:18:58.734 --> 01:19:00.156
"With friends."

01:19:08.202 --> 01:19:09.545
Thank you.

01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:12.957
Life goes on, AJ.

01:19:13.749 --> 01:19:15.615
Yes, it certainly does.

01:19:15.641 --> 01:19:18.075
And you have a wife now.

01:19:21.090 --> 01:19:21.994
She's no wife.

01:19:22.020 --> 01:19:24.085
What on earth do you mean?

01:19:24.134 --> 01:19:25.761
She's with him.

01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:28.347
That's what I mean.

01:19:38.190 --> 01:19:42.787
Do you know that we're sitting on 264 million years of rock?

01:19:43.779 --> 01:19:45.076
No.

01:19:48.826 --> 01:19:50.205
I'm going to paint you now.

01:19:50.231 --> 01:19:51.149
Close your eyes.

01:19:57.459 --> 01:19:59.507
Does AJ know?

01:20:01.005 --> 01:20:02.302
He knows.

01:20:06.844 --> 01:20:07.607
What on earth...?

01:20:07.633 --> 01:20:09.292
I'm painting. I'm painting you.

01:20:09.346 --> 01:20:11.033
Give in. Just give in.

01:20:11.059 --> 01:20:12.591
Stop it. Stop.

01:20:30.492 --> 01:20:33.541
And, Captain Evans, did you know...

01:20:36.290 --> 01:20:40.420
Did you know they've put a telegraph cable all the way under the sea?

01:20:40.544 --> 01:20:42.262
All the way to America.

01:20:43.589 --> 01:20:45.637
Imagine all of that cable,

01:20:45.758 --> 01:20:48.978
all those voices saying, "I love you", echoing along it.

01:20:50.888 --> 01:20:52.890
Will you write to me every day?

01:20:59.021 --> 01:21:01.069
Where shall I write?

01:21:02.358 --> 01:21:04.360
The hotel.

01:21:05.736 --> 01:21:07.704
Are you sure you'll still be here?

01:21:10.282 --> 01:21:12.284
You're so beautiful.

01:21:14.578 --> 01:21:16.580
My beautiful soldier.

01:21:18.499 --> 01:21:20.501
My captain.

01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:42.064
Why can't there be a telegraph cable to Nigeria?

01:21:45.692 --> 01:21:47.069
There will be.

01:21:59.039 --> 01:22:01.337
It's like a summer's day, isn't it?

01:22:05.421 --> 01:22:07.423
Summer in February.

01:22:11.051 --> 01:22:12.553
Which train is it?

01:22:19.101 --> 01:22:21.103
The first one in the morning.

01:22:26.567 --> 01:22:28.615
Come back for me.

01:22:30.988 --> 01:22:32.990
I will.

01:22:34.158 --> 01:22:35.660
Tell me again.

01:22:40.539 --> 01:22:42.541
I love you.

01:22:44.418 --> 01:22:46.261
I love you.

01:25:11.815 --> 01:25:13.817
- Afternoon, madam.
- Hello.

01:25:17.487 --> 01:25:19.160
Florence.

01:25:19.281 --> 01:25:20.533
Mm-hmm.

01:25:20.616 --> 01:25:22.618
I was just wondering how your work is coming along.

01:25:26.830 --> 01:25:28.423
It's gone.

01:25:30.042 --> 01:25:31.339
I can't.

01:25:32.461 --> 01:25:33.883
Yes, you can.

01:25:35.714 --> 01:25:37.512
Unless he comes back.

01:25:45.307 --> 01:25:46.934
Some tea, I think.

01:25:50.187 --> 01:25:51.689
Are you going to come to the party?

01:25:52.814 --> 01:25:55.512
Oh, er, I expect so.

01:25:55.538 --> 01:25:57.561
We always do.

01:25:57.653 --> 01:26:00.076
Fancy dress wouldn't be the same without you.

01:26:01.365 --> 01:26:02.912
Does he know?

01:26:03.867 --> 01:26:05.289
What?

01:26:06.536 --> 01:26:08.163
Oh, come on, Florence.

01:26:13.460 --> 01:26:14.928
I can't tell him.

01:26:16.963 --> 01:26:20.684
You'll have to... fairly soon.

01:26:27.724 --> 01:26:29.101
It's not his.

01:26:34.564 --> 01:26:35.816
Are you sure?

01:26:43.907 --> 01:26:45.454
It can't be his.

01:27:47.429 --> 01:27:49.431
AJ's coming over to us.

01:27:52.142 --> 01:27:54.736
What are you up to, Laura?

01:27:54.811 --> 01:27:56.984
Painting some fishermen over in Newlyn.

01:27:57.063 --> 01:27:59.157
No.

01:27:59.316 --> 01:28:00.659
Not that.

01:28:02.152 --> 01:28:03.199
With her?

01:28:03.862 --> 01:28:05.455
What were you up to just now?

01:28:05.572 --> 01:28:06.755
We were just talking.

01:28:06.781 --> 01:28:07.850
Just talking.

01:28:09.409 --> 01:28:11.411
Just talking.

01:28:12.788 --> 01:28:13.880
Look at her.

01:28:25.175 --> 01:28:26.552
Go on.

01:28:27.344 --> 01:28:28.766
Off you go.

01:28:31.515 --> 01:28:32.983
You whore!

01:28:48.448 --> 01:28:50.200
Florence, my dear, are you all right?

01:28:50.325 --> 01:28:51.451
Oh.

How do?

01:33:03.495 --> 01:33:05.247
Captain Evans.

01:33:28.895 --> 01:33:30.772
Gilbert.

01:33:30.855 --> 01:33:32.698
Harold.

01:33:35.110 --> 01:33:37.533
Good to see you.

01:33:37.737 --> 01:33:39.660
Very good.

01:33:55.630 --> 01:33:59.430
So you don't want me to come with you?

01:33:59.634 --> 01:34:01.557
No, thank you.

01:34:06.307 --> 01:34:08.776
Do give my love to Laura, won't you?

01:34:08.893 --> 01:34:11.487
I will. I will.

01:34:11.646 --> 01:34:14.274
One moment.
 One moment, there's...

01:34:14.399 --> 01:34:16.401
There's this for you.

01:34:24.993 --> 01:34:26.870
Thank you, Harold.

01:35:40.944 --> 01:35:45.120
<i>Dear Gilbert, one day
you'll come back to Lamorna.</i>

01:35:45.240 --> 01:35:47.242
<i>I know you will.</i>

01:35:48.451 --> 01:35:54.549
<i>And when you do, I hope that you will
accept this from your old friend.</i>
