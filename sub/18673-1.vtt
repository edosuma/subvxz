01:21.500 --> 01:23.092
McCaleb.

01:23.500 --> 01:26.458
Whatever happens,
ill be his face on the front page.

01:42.420 --> 01:43.773
What do you have?

01:43.980 --> 01:47.097
I've had hemorrhoids for a while. You?

01:47.260 --> 01:50.855
Victims five and six.
Code Killer strikes again.

01:52.500 --> 01:54.491
You're not a vegetarian, right?

01:54.700 --> 01:58.295
How do you like your steak?
Big, red, juicy?

01:58.500 --> 02:03.654
WALLER: Neighbor complained about
the noise. He got run over at the door.

02:04.620 --> 02:07.259
Neighbor said he saw this
from the door.

02:07.460 --> 02:10.735
ARRANGO: Bachelor number one
hasn't been dating lately.

02:10.940 --> 02:13.135
Apparently, he's a bed wetter.

02:13.340 --> 02:16.218
MCCALEB:
You're sick, you know that, Arrango?

02:16.540 --> 02:21.660
WALLER: Neighbor didn't see a thing.
ARRANGO: This might be important too.

02:21.860 --> 02:26.331
The maid quit about six years ago.
She didn't like the neighborhood.

02:32.540 --> 02:34.610
We're calling him Chuck Taylor.

02:34.820 --> 02:36.617
Oh, how's that?

02:37.260 --> 02:39.535
Well, the prints. Look.

02:40.020 --> 02:42.090
Converse. High-tops.

02:42.300 --> 02:44.256
Chuck Taylor.

02:46.260 --> 02:48.091
You get it, right?

02:49.420 --> 02:54.255
You don't know who Chuck Taylor is?
Basketball coach. Stanford Cardinals.

02:54.980 --> 02:57.733
We got the remains
of two or three people.

02:57.940 --> 03:00.056
ARRANGO:
One of them could be a midget.

03:00.260 --> 03:02.854
In any case, is a hell of a gangbang.

03:03.060 --> 03:06.336
MCCALEB: Once you joke about it,
you shouldn't be doing it.

03:09.420 --> 03:12.457
MAN 1: Get the stretcher.
MAN 2: All right.

03:20.020 --> 03:21.578
Another love note.

03:21.780 --> 03:25.090
Maybe the two of you ought to get
a room someplace.

03:39.300 --> 03:41.575
MALE REPORTER: McCaleb.
FEMALE REPORTER 1: Another message?

03:41.740 --> 03:43.731
- Why is he singling you out?
MCCALEB: I can't comment.

03:43.940 --> 03:45.339
I can't comment.

03:45.540 --> 03:47.417
FEMALE REPORTER 1:
Are there numbers this time?

03:50.060 --> 03:51.732
He loves it.

03:52.540 --> 03:54.770
What does the message say?

03:54.980 --> 03:56.936
FEMALE REPORTER 2:
Why does he focus on you?

03:57.100 --> 03:58.419
Do we have numbers this time?

03:58.620 --> 04:00.372
FEMALE REPORTER 3:
Were there numbers?

04:01.180 --> 04:04.616
- Why does he single you out?
FEMALE REPORTER 1: What does he want?

04:05.700 --> 04:06.815
Chuck.

04:06.980 --> 04:08.174
You got a motive?

07:09.580 --> 07:10.979
MAN:
Clear.

07:15.020 --> 07:16.612
WOMAN:
Almost there.

07:16.820 --> 07:18.697
Good. Coming out.

07:19.180 --> 07:21.614
Good, Terry. You did good.

07:25.260 --> 07:27.057
Are you taking your pills?

07:27.260 --> 07:28.295
Yeah.

07:28.500 --> 07:30.809
Yeah, all 34 of them.

07:31.300 --> 07:34.212
- No fever at all?
- No.

07:34.380 --> 07:36.052
All clear of that.

07:36.260 --> 07:39.013
- No diarrhea?
- No, nothing.

07:39.220 --> 07:40.619
Good.

07:40.940 --> 07:44.455
- Blood pressure and pulse?
- Right on target.

07:44.620 --> 07:46.850
You're not working too hard
on the boat?

07:47.060 --> 07:51.212
No, just enough to keep it afloat.
Thas all.

07:51.420 --> 07:53.251
I'll be back in a bit.

07:53.420 --> 07:57.254
I'll check this blood work
and get the tissue to the lab.

07:58.220 --> 07:59.494
Okay.

08:16.980 --> 08:20.609
Don't start running laps yet,
but I'm very pleased.

08:20.780 --> 08:24.170
No rejection.
All your blood levels are good.

08:24.340 --> 08:27.730
- I might lower your prednisone next week.
- Thank God.

08:27.940 --> 08:30.454
I'm tired of shaving
three times a day.

08:30.660 --> 08:32.298
FOX:
Lean forward.

08:37.140 --> 08:39.779
- May I ask you something?
- No, don't talk.

08:39.940 --> 08:41.259
Sit up.

08:42.980 --> 08:44.811
Okay, come around.

08:53.860 --> 08:56.772
All right. What did you want to ask me?

08:56.980 --> 08:59.448
The kid in 218...

08:59.660 --> 09:01.093
...whas his blood type?

09:01.260 --> 09:04.855
Is different from yours,
if thas what you wanted to know.

09:05.060 --> 09:09.497
- How long has he been waiting?
- About half as long as you did.

09:10.340 --> 09:12.934
What are his chances?

09:13.180 --> 09:17.856
Maybe 50-50, maybe less.
Whas bothering you, Terry?

09:18.020 --> 09:19.009
MCCALEB:
I don't know.

09:19.980 --> 09:24.974
When I was at the Bureau, we had
to qualify once a year on the range.

09:25.180 --> 09:28.138
You know, shoot at targets,
stuff like that.

09:30.380 --> 09:33.975
We had a thing where you shoot
a circle around a heart.

09:34.140 --> 09:38.372
It was called the "10 ring."
That was the highest score.

09:38.860 --> 09:40.578
Typical.

09:40.900 --> 09:43.539
You wait for a heart for two years...

09:43.700 --> 09:48.615
...almost don't make it, then wonder
if we shoulďve given you that heart.

09:48.820 --> 09:50.572
Know what that is?

09:51.300 --> 09:52.289
B. S?

09:53.140 --> 09:56.849
Exactly. Go home and enjoy your boat.
See you next week.

09:59.420 --> 10:01.092
WOMAN: Hey, Terry.
MCCALEB: How you doing?

10:09.700 --> 10:11.338
BUDDY:
Morning, Terry.

10:11.500 --> 10:15.254
Morning?
Is 2 in the afternoon, Buddy.

10:15.460 --> 10:19.612
As long as my dad sends those checks,
is whatever time I say it is.

10:19.780 --> 10:22.214
- Whatever.
- Heads up, by the way.

10:22.860 --> 10:25.090
Somebody's on your boat.

10:26.540 --> 10:30.579
Been here 10 minutes. Looked harmless.
I didn't say anything.

10:31.860 --> 10:34.215
Looks better than harmless!

10:39.780 --> 10:41.771
MCCALEB:
May I help you, miss?

10:42.540 --> 10:44.610
I'm looking for Terry McCaleb.

10:47.020 --> 10:48.772
You're looking at him.

10:48.980 --> 10:50.698
Graciella Rivers.

10:51.340 --> 10:56.130
I have read about you in the paper,
in the "Where are they now?" column.

10:56.340 --> 10:58.535
You know, in the Metro section.

10:58.700 --> 11:02.090
You're not the first person
to try to find me.

11:02.260 --> 11:06.048
I can recommend a good
investigator who won't rip you off.

11:06.260 --> 11:10.856
The article said you're the best
and you hate when someone gets away.

11:11.060 --> 11:15.656
If you read it, you know what happened
and that I'm retired, Miss Rivers.

11:15.860 --> 11:16.975
Graciella.

11:17.380 --> 11:18.369
Graciella.

11:18.900 --> 11:20.652
I think you could help me.

11:20.820 --> 11:22.014
How's that?

11:22.780 --> 11:25.738
- Maybe even help yourself.
- I don't need money.

11:25.900 --> 11:28.414
I'm not talking about money.

11:35.780 --> 11:36.769
MCCALEB:
Sister?

11:37.100 --> 11:39.409
- And her son.
- Which one?

11:39.980 --> 11:42.733
- Excuse me?
- Which one's dead?

11:43.340 --> 11:45.137
My sister.

11:45.700 --> 11:48.533
Gloria Torres. Glory.

11:48.940 --> 11:51.738
And her son's name is Raymond.

11:52.260 --> 11:56.538
- I don't think I can help you.
- Just look at it again, please.

11:56.940 --> 12:00.296
Just one more time,
and I'll leave you alone.

12:00.500 --> 12:03.731
Just tell me if you perceive
or feel anything.

12:04.620 --> 12:08.090
Miss Rivers, I'm a retired FBI man,
not a psychic.

12:10.380 --> 12:13.656
- Do you want this back or not?
- I have a double.

12:13.860 --> 12:16.374
You know, two for the price of one.

12:16.900 --> 12:19.653
- You'll want to keep that one.
- Why is that?

12:25.900 --> 12:27.652
Your heart, Mr. McCaleb.

12:28.820 --> 12:30.856
It was my sister's.

12:31.860 --> 12:35.170
- How do you know that?
- Newspaper.

12:35.380 --> 12:38.975
You two have the same blood type,
AB with CMV negative.

12:39.180 --> 12:41.694
You were operated on the day she died.

12:42.380 --> 12:46.168
My number's on the back
if you change your mind.

13:21.100 --> 13:23.978
Miss Rivers, this is Terry McCaleb.

13:24.180 --> 13:27.297
Yeah, I'm sorry about it
being so late...

13:27.500 --> 13:32.654
...but I wanted to tell you I'm going
to the police to see whas going on.

13:32.860 --> 13:35.533
Don't thank me.
Don't get your hopes up.

13:35.700 --> 13:39.978
I'm just gonna have a look.
I owe your sister that much.

13:55.780 --> 13:56.895
May I help you?

13:57.100 --> 14:00.729
- Detective Arrango and Waller around?
- Your name?

14:01.140 --> 14:04.610
McCaleb.
I'm here about the Gloria Torres case.

14:07.420 --> 14:08.569
Is McCaleb.

14:12.700 --> 14:16.295
Down the hall, up the stairs,
first door on your right.

14:16.500 --> 14:18.058
Thanks.

14:24.620 --> 14:26.178
Well, Mr. McCaleb.

14:26.340 --> 14:27.489
Detective Arrango.

14:27.660 --> 14:29.810
I thought you were dead
or retired.

14:29.980 --> 14:33.052
I hear you want to talk
about Gloria Torres.

14:33.220 --> 14:34.938
Can we talk privately?

14:35.100 --> 14:36.089
About what?

14:36.260 --> 14:40.173
- I'm looking into her death.
- Here we go, same old shit.

14:40.660 --> 14:45.176
I'll give you five minutes, thas it,
before I toss your ass right out.

14:48.820 --> 14:52.290
- My partner will be here in a minute.
- Want a doughnut?

14:52.460 --> 14:56.294
I want to know who you're working for.
Her sister, right?

14:56.460 --> 14:57.609
Thas right.

14:57.780 --> 15:01.136
I knew it. Son of a bitch.
Let me see your ticket.

15:01.580 --> 15:05.209
I don't have a license,
if thas what you mean.

15:05.900 --> 15:07.492
Is it stuffy in here?

15:08.340 --> 15:09.409
Is it hot?

15:09.580 --> 15:10.695
No.

15:11.020 --> 15:12.612
Just get a little air.

15:15.980 --> 15:19.655
Let me give us some air
and make it more comfortable.

15:19.820 --> 15:24.132
Okay, let me get this straight. You're
conducting a homicide investigation...

15:24.300 --> 15:26.814
...into the Gloria Torres case?

15:26.980 --> 15:28.129
Thas true.

15:28.300 --> 15:33.169
You don't have a license to practice
as a private investigator in California?

15:33.860 --> 15:35.009
Thas right.

15:35.500 --> 15:40.176
Do you know is a crime to practice
as an investigator without a license?

15:40.340 --> 15:42.251
Will you knock off the crap?

15:42.500 --> 15:45.856
I just wanted to have a talk.
Knock off the tape too.

15:46.020 --> 15:49.808
- He's blocking the microphone anyway.
- Why didn't you say?

15:49.980 --> 15:53.734
In the three years we've
interrogated here, maybe I forgot.

15:53.900 --> 15:57.734
Come on, fellas. I'm just
here to help. Have a doughnut.

16:03.700 --> 16:05.975
How do you know Graciella Rivers?

16:06.140 --> 16:10.531
She's an acquaintance.
I told her I'd look into it. Thas all.

16:12.620 --> 16:15.896
If you guys aren't gonna have one,
I'm gonna have one.

16:37.980 --> 16:39.015
Look.

16:39.660 --> 16:43.812
I don't care what her sister told you,
Mr. Former FBI Profiler.

16:43.980 --> 16:46.369
This ain't the type of case you like.

16:46.540 --> 16:49.816
This ain't a glamorous case
that will get headlines.

16:50.300 --> 16:53.929
This isn't Charles Manson
or Ted fucking Bundy.

16:54.100 --> 16:57.251
This is an ordinary
convenience-store robbery.

16:57.420 --> 16:59.012
Some idiot with a gun...

16:59.180 --> 17:03.059
...with the right ratio
of balls to brains pulled the trigger.

17:03.220 --> 17:05.415
I told her I'd check it out.

17:05.579 --> 17:09.732
You've been on this a while,
and a fresh pair of eyes won't hurt.

17:09.900 --> 17:14.178
I won't grandstand anybody.
I'll give any information to you first.

17:14.339 --> 17:16.773
I'm not trying to one-up anyone.

17:16.940 --> 17:18.055
What do you want?

17:18.380 --> 17:22.009
A copy of the murder book
and a video walk-through of the scene.

17:22.180 --> 17:24.535
I was always good with crime scenes.

17:24.700 --> 17:26.179
- No can do.
- Why not?

17:26.339 --> 17:29.571
- No way, man.
- How often does the sister call you?

17:30.220 --> 17:35.055
Every day, weekends, holidays...
Believe it or not, we got feelings.

17:35.220 --> 17:38.690
It hurts me to tell her there
are no leads or suspects.

17:38.860 --> 17:41.215
I can get her off your case.

17:41.380 --> 17:46.852
I tell her I looked into it, you're
doing a good job, she stops calling.

17:47.940 --> 17:50.374
You were always good at a crime scene.

17:50.540 --> 17:53.134
But the key word is "were."
Are you still?

17:53.300 --> 17:56.656
You just give me a copy
of the tape, thas all.

17:56.940 --> 17:58.373
Oh.

17:58.860 --> 18:01.693
We got more than
just the crime-scene tape.

18:02.380 --> 18:04.450
We've got the crime.

18:04.620 --> 18:07.180
Bring the doughnuts. Come on.

18:11.820 --> 18:14.209
WALLER:
Thas Kyungwon Kang, the owner.

18:14.420 --> 18:19.175
ARRANGO: He's making his last sale.
She comes in to buy a candy bar.

18:19.660 --> 18:21.412
Yeah, for her kid.

18:22.100 --> 18:26.730
And here he is. Ba-da-bing! Pow, pow.

18:27.380 --> 18:30.292
He picked up all the shells.

18:31.260 --> 18:32.249
MCCALEB:
Hm.

18:32.460 --> 18:35.338
<i>Won't see this on
America 's Favorite Videos.</i>

18:35.500 --> 18:40.290
- There's no sound on that camera?
- Right. He's just talking to himself.

18:40.780 --> 18:44.659
- Could you run it in slow motion?
- Hold on. Is not over.

18:45.260 --> 18:48.969
This guy coming up we call
the Good Samaritan. Watch.

18:49.460 --> 18:54.215
This guy goes up and down the aisles,
looking for bandages, I guess.

18:54.820 --> 18:58.654
Couldn't find any, so he used paper
towels to wrap her head.

18:59.460 --> 19:02.497
The camera never really
gets a good look at him.

19:02.660 --> 19:06.699
After he's finished, he goes outside,
he dials 911...

19:07.340 --> 19:08.739
...and splits.

19:08.900 --> 19:13.052
The voice was Latino. We figure
he was illegal, afraid to stay.

19:13.220 --> 19:15.450
Yeah. Thas too bad.

19:15.620 --> 19:19.454
He probably got a look
at the car or the shooter.

19:19.620 --> 19:24.250
We put out fliers, went on all
the Spanish stations. Nothing.

19:24.900 --> 19:27.812
- May I?
- Knock yourself out.

19:37.660 --> 19:40.777
Pushing the pause button
ain't gonna help her.

19:45.420 --> 19:47.809
$32 in the cash register.

19:47.980 --> 19:50.050
Look at that. He winked.

19:50.540 --> 19:51.973
WALLER:
What?

19:53.620 --> 19:54.848
Yeah.

19:59.940 --> 20:01.578
Huh.

20:04.940 --> 20:07.329
ARRANGO:
Well, there you have it, Mr. FBI Guy.

20:07.700 --> 20:09.930
Tell us something we don't know.

20:10.220 --> 20:12.780
The shooter's been
in the store before.

20:12.940 --> 20:15.500
He knew the placement
of the camera.

20:15.660 --> 20:18.857
He's from the neighborhood,
or he just cased the place.

20:19.020 --> 20:21.898
This isn't the first time either.

20:22.060 --> 20:25.257
No emotion, no panic,
policed up his own brass.

20:26.020 --> 20:28.739
This guy's done it before.

20:33.620 --> 20:35.576
What?

20:37.420 --> 20:39.650
How many others?

20:40.620 --> 20:42.850
Let me look at the murder book.

20:43.020 --> 20:45.693
We have to talk to our lieutenant.
We'll be in touch.

20:45.860 --> 20:49.648
- When?
- Give me a number. We'll be in touch!

20:49.820 --> 20:52.380
WALLER: Jesus Christ.

20:59.860 --> 21:03.853
You guys can keep the doughnuts.

21:04.460 --> 21:07.338
We don't need your doughnuts
or your shit!

21:07.500 --> 21:09.092
We got enough of our own!

21:14.460 --> 21:16.337
WOMAN:
Okay. Thanks.

21:22.820 --> 21:26.415
MCCALEB: Mrs. Kang?
- Yes? I know you?

21:26.580 --> 21:27.649
No.

21:28.020 --> 21:32.889
I heard what happened here.
Your husband and all. I'm sorry.

21:33.060 --> 21:35.290
Yes, thank you.

21:35.460 --> 21:38.850
The only way to keep evil out
is not unlock door.

21:39.020 --> 21:41.215
We can't do that.

21:41.380 --> 21:43.848
- We must have business.
- Yeah.

21:44.620 --> 21:46.690
Thank you, ma'am.

22:07.460 --> 22:11.169
You gonna pay me, or should
I drive you somewhere else?

22:13.900 --> 22:16.494
MCCALEB:
Nearest public library.

23:06.380 --> 23:09.133
Detective Winston said to wait here.
She'll be right with you.

23:09.300 --> 23:10.858
Thanks.

23:28.260 --> 23:30.216
Huh.

23:31.020 --> 23:34.535
Well, well, well, Terry McCaleb.

23:36.660 --> 23:40.130
- Hi.
- As I live and breathe.

23:43.820 --> 23:45.333
Look at you.

23:47.020 --> 23:48.578
Look at you.

23:48.940 --> 23:50.817
I hear you got a new ticker.

23:51.300 --> 23:55.293
Thas right. I'm all right, though.

23:58.380 --> 24:00.689
How are you doing, babe?

24:01.260 --> 24:03.979
Me? You know, same old, same old.

24:04.740 --> 24:07.777
So, whas up?
You on a private ticket now?

24:07.940 --> 24:10.977
No. Just doing a favor for a friend.

24:11.140 --> 24:12.289
What case is it?

24:12.820 --> 24:17.098
James Cordell. ATM holdup.

24:17.260 --> 24:18.409
Les see.

24:18.980 --> 24:24.452
January 22. Newspaper says he was
shot by a guy wearing a ski mask.

24:24.940 --> 24:27.977
Who's this friend you're
doing the favor for?

24:28.140 --> 24:33.339
Graciella Rivers. Her sister was
shot in a store two weeks after.

24:34.060 --> 24:36.255
Also a man in a ski mask.

24:36.820 --> 24:39.015
Am I right? Are they connected?

24:39.500 --> 24:42.697
Yeah. Same guy.
Out of your orbit, though.

24:42.860 --> 24:46.057
Scumbag with a gun.
Three-strikes shit, thas all.

24:46.220 --> 24:47.289
MCCALEB:
What do you mean?

24:47.460 --> 24:51.453
Guy has two felonies,
third puts him away for life.

24:51.620 --> 24:54.214
So he kills any witnesses.

24:54.500 --> 24:58.937
Robbery, murder, is all the same
sentence for him either way.

24:59.340 --> 25:03.219
I talked to the boys over at L.A.P.D.,
and they showed me a tape...

25:03.380 --> 25:06.497
...but they wouldn't copy
me the murder book.

25:06.660 --> 25:08.616
Hm.

25:08.780 --> 25:12.011
- I'll bet they copied you, though.
- Hm.

25:13.140 --> 25:15.574
Come on, darling,
you owe me just one little one.

25:16.820 --> 25:18.538
I know that.

25:19.620 --> 25:22.134
When you handed me
the Cemetery Man bust...

25:22.340 --> 25:27.619
...you were my membership into
this boys club. I haven't forgotten.

25:28.020 --> 25:30.454
Does that mean yes?

25:33.420 --> 25:35.297
Terry McCaleb.

25:38.420 --> 25:41.378
Lucky for us the bank
had two cameras on this.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.132
The shooter's back there.

25:43.300 --> 25:47.612
I'm betting the mask isn't on yet,
or Cordell would have run.

25:47.780 --> 25:51.932
H&K 9mm, same model used
in the Valley tape.

25:54.100 --> 25:56.614
Hold that.
Back it up a little bit.

25:56.900 --> 26:00.210
Back up there.
Look, he's saying something.

26:00.380 --> 26:03.213
Like in the Valley tape.
He talked there too.

26:03.380 --> 26:05.940
Yeah, he's a real chatterbox.

26:06.260 --> 26:08.820
Did you get a lip reader in?

26:10.060 --> 26:11.971
I'll get on it.

26:12.140 --> 26:15.735
What about his cartridge?
Did he pick up his brass?

26:17.220 --> 26:19.495
- Yeah, there he is.
- Uh-huh.

26:20.740 --> 26:22.093
James Lockridge.

26:22.260 --> 26:26.173
Pulled into the bank lot,
almost got sideswiped by a sedan.

26:26.340 --> 26:29.093
Says it was a white guy,
but nothing else.

26:29.420 --> 26:33.572
He called for the ambulance.
Cordell died going to the hospital.

26:33.740 --> 26:36.300
You got any leads at all?

26:36.460 --> 26:39.850
No, I'm following
the three-strike thing.

26:40.020 --> 26:43.649
I think the man in the ski mask
is one of those.

26:45.100 --> 26:48.854
What about the gun? H&K's
expensive for a holdup man.

26:49.020 --> 26:52.137
Thas weird he'd keep
it after the first killing.

26:52.300 --> 26:56.737
I thought about that. I figure he
stole it, but that lead me nowhere.

26:56.940 --> 27:02.458
I don't know. I think we'll need
fresh blood to solve this one.

27:03.540 --> 27:06.816
Well, Jaye...

27:06.980 --> 27:10.256
...why don't you get me
a copy of the book?

27:10.540 --> 27:12.451
Both yours and L.A. Could you?

27:12.660 --> 27:15.333
I'll ask the captain.
I don't see why not.

27:15.500 --> 27:18.572
He was the lieutenant
on the Cemetery Man case.

27:18.740 --> 27:21.652
Yeah, I kind of remember that.

27:21.820 --> 27:26.371
Oh, well. I'm glad
someone got promoted.

27:29.580 --> 27:33.129
- Right here.
- Thanks.

27:34.620 --> 27:37.930
Mr. Lockridge, Terry McCaleb.
Thanks for seeing me.

27:38.100 --> 27:39.374
LOCKRIDGE:
Are you a policeman?

27:39.540 --> 27:44.455
No, retired FBI. I'm investigating
a related case for a victim's family.

27:44.620 --> 27:47.498
- Good. Because police are stupid.
- Why?

27:49.260 --> 27:51.820
- Didn't they tell you?
- No.

27:52.020 --> 27:56.411
Why would they? When I found
the guy, I call 911, right?

27:56.620 --> 27:57.609
MCCALEB: Yeah.
- Yeah.

27:57.780 --> 28:00.772
They sent the ambulance
to the wrong place.

28:00.940 --> 28:02.658
Took them 20 minutes.

28:02.820 --> 28:05.937
He might have made it
if they hadn't screwed up.

28:06.100 --> 28:08.011
- Those things happen.
- No.

28:08.180 --> 28:11.172
They screwed up. A guy died.
End of story.

28:11.900 --> 28:15.973
I'm busy. I agreed to see you
because you're already here, so...

28:16.140 --> 28:17.414
...what do you want?

28:17.580 --> 28:20.219
I thought you'd give your
statement to me firsthand.

28:20.380 --> 28:23.019
For the love of God.
I needed cash.

28:23.180 --> 28:26.377
As I pulled up, the guy
driving out almost hits me.

28:26.540 --> 28:31.170
All I saw was a car.
There were no plates, no face, nothing.

28:31.340 --> 28:34.537
I walk up to the ATM,
and there's this guy bleeding.

28:34.700 --> 28:38.659
I figured he got it right before
I got there, so I called 911.

28:38.820 --> 28:43.177
Ten minutes later, they come,
driving right fucking past us. Past us.

28:43.340 --> 28:45.058
Any other details?

28:45.220 --> 28:48.974
It coulďve been me.
Coulďve been him finding me...

28:49.140 --> 28:54.419
...with the ambulance driving
right on fucking by. Good stuff.

29:30.100 --> 29:32.170
You done?

29:35.980 --> 29:37.936
Yeah.

29:45.700 --> 29:46.689
Hey, Buddy.

29:46.860 --> 29:50.535
Here's to you. Semper fi,
auld lang syne, keep on trucking.

29:50.700 --> 29:53.260
You look like a skunk.

29:55.180 --> 29:58.889
- What are you doing tomorrow?
- Same as always. Big, fat goose egg.

29:59.540 --> 30:03.169
I could use a driver.
$ 10 an hour and meals.

30:03.660 --> 30:07.938
- Whas up? An investigation?
- I just need a driver, not a partner.

30:08.340 --> 30:10.808
Okay. I'm in. Whose car?

30:10.980 --> 30:14.893
If we take yours, I'll buy gas,
or I'll sit in the back in mine...

30:15.060 --> 30:17.779
...because of the air bags.
- Your chest, right?

30:18.020 --> 30:19.055
Yeah.

30:19.220 --> 30:23.099
Les take mine. That way
I won't feel like a chauffeur.

30:24.260 --> 30:26.330
See you in the a.m.

30:26.980 --> 30:30.939
You look tired, Terry.
You should get some sleep!

30:55.100 --> 31:00.618
You don't deserve it.

31:35.700 --> 31:39.295
First of all, I have no idea
where your heart came from.

31:39.620 --> 31:42.498
All BOPRA tells us is they
have an organ...

31:42.660 --> 31:45.220
...with a match to someone on the list.

31:45.380 --> 31:47.814
In your case, we told you
what we knew.

31:47.980 --> 31:52.451
Female, 32, perfect health,
perfect blood typing, perfect donor.

31:52.620 --> 31:54.975
She was murdered.

31:55.140 --> 31:56.812
- Murdered?
- Yeah.

31:56.980 --> 31:58.732
What are you talking about?

31:59.020 --> 32:03.377
She was shot during a robbery and lived
long enough for me to get her heart.

32:03.660 --> 32:07.653
How do you know? You're not
supposed to know about the donor.

32:07.860 --> 32:09.418
Her sister found me.

32:09.580 --> 32:13.892
She read about how I had a rare
blood type like her sister...

32:14.060 --> 32:16.972
...and that my surgery
was on the day she died.

32:17.140 --> 32:19.574
What does she want? Money?

32:21.060 --> 32:23.176
I'm glad you can find it funny.

32:23.540 --> 32:26.338
She wants me to find out who did it.

32:26.500 --> 32:28.775
She wants me to solve the murder.

32:28.940 --> 32:33.058
Shit. Give me this woman's
name right now.

32:35.860 --> 32:39.853
- You're not thinking of doing this?
- I started yesterday.

32:40.020 --> 32:44.298
And today you're running a fever!
You are 60 days post-transplant!

32:44.460 --> 32:47.293
As your doctor,
I'm ordering you not to do this.

32:47.460 --> 32:52.454
- Respect the gift you were given.
- I do, I do. It was her gift.

32:52.620 --> 32:56.135
She'd be dead either way.
You don't owe her.

32:56.460 --> 32:58.690
It was supposed to be an accident.

32:58.860 --> 33:02.694
99 out of 100 of these are head
injuries that end up fatal.

33:02.860 --> 33:03.849
This one is different.

33:04.020 --> 33:07.171
How is it different?
A hears a heart!

33:07.340 --> 33:09.695
An accident is fate. Murder is evil.

33:09.900 --> 33:10.889
Please.

33:12.460 --> 33:17.898
I wouldn't have this gift if somebody
hadn't done this hateful, evil thing.

33:18.380 --> 33:20.018
You're not making sense.

33:20.180 --> 33:23.968
She goes into a store
to buy a candy bar for her kid.

33:24.340 --> 33:25.614
I can't explain it.

33:27.180 --> 33:29.489
Terry, sit down.

33:35.980 --> 33:41.293
- You know that little boy in room 218?
- Yeah.

33:41.460 --> 33:45.976
He's waiting for a heart that
isn't coming. That could be you.

33:46.220 --> 33:50.008
This is your one chance, Terry.
You tell that woman no.

33:50.380 --> 33:53.292
You save yourself and tell her no!

33:53.460 --> 33:54.688
I can't.

33:54.860 --> 33:56.930
You're gambling with your life.

33:57.100 --> 34:00.410
You get infection or rejection,
there's nothing we can do.

34:00.580 --> 34:03.174
- I have no choice.
- Neither do I.

34:03.340 --> 34:06.855
I can't be your doctor.
I won't be around for this.

34:07.020 --> 34:08.498
Come on, doc.

34:08.659 --> 34:11.538
I'll have your records ready
in the morning.

34:11.699 --> 34:13.257
Good luck, Terry.

34:25.500 --> 34:29.254
Graciella. Make it quick.

34:32.659 --> 34:34.378
<i>- Hello?
MCCALEB: Graciella.</i>

34:34.580 --> 34:35.695
This is McCaleb.

34:35.860 --> 34:38.010
<i>GRACIELLA:
Whas going on?</i>

34:38.219 --> 34:39.572
Tell me about her.

34:41.020 --> 34:42.168
What do you mean?

34:42.580 --> 34:44.935
Just tell me something about Gloria.

34:45.260 --> 34:49.411
The more I know, the more
I can get a handle on this thing.

34:49.980 --> 34:52.130
Do you have a kitchen on the boat?

34:52.659 --> 34:54.810
A galley, yeah.

34:55.179 --> 34:57.694
Is it big enough to cook a real meal?

34:58.380 --> 35:00.371
Yeah, sort of.

35:00.940 --> 35:02.851
So...

35:03.020 --> 35:06.569
You want to know my sister,
you'll have to meet her son.

35:07.180 --> 35:10.570
He's everything that was good
about her. Is in him.

35:10.740 --> 35:13.937
I'll bring him by later,
and I'll make you dinner.

35:15.340 --> 35:16.614
Good. I'd like that.

35:16.940 --> 35:20.376
Okay. Then you can
give me an update.

35:20.540 --> 35:26.809
Look, just so you know it, these cases
usually turn on some small detail.

35:26.980 --> 35:30.529
Something someone forgot
or didn't think was important.

35:30.700 --> 35:33.009
Thas the key.
I'll have to find it.

35:33.420 --> 35:36.492
You have Glory's heart.
She'll guide you.

35:37.540 --> 35:40.259
Yeah. Thanks.

35:47.260 --> 35:49.091
Quick enough?

35:53.620 --> 35:55.690
BUDDY: You okay?
- Yeah.

35:55.940 --> 35:57.578
BUDDY: Huh?
- Dandy.

35:58.060 --> 36:02.099
BUDDY: I'll tell you what. Let me stop
by the In-N-Out on Victory.

36:14.300 --> 36:17.576
I don't think they serve
hamburgers here. Whas up?

36:17.740 --> 36:22.097
The sheriff's office listed all
the three-strikes robbery suspects.

36:22.260 --> 36:27.539
They also made a list of every H&K P7
pistol stolen in the last few years.

36:27.700 --> 36:31.329
I charted that list
plus the address...

36:31.500 --> 36:34.731
...and the work location
of every man on the list.

36:34.900 --> 36:37.892
- A cross-reference to check overlap?
- Exactly.

36:38.060 --> 36:43.180
One guy stands out like a whore
in church, and thas Mikail Bolotov.

36:43.340 --> 36:47.856
He's a two-time loser, lives a mile
from where Gloria Torres was shot...

36:48.020 --> 36:51.854
...and works four blocks from where
an H&K was stolen in December.

36:52.020 --> 36:54.898
Why didn't they arrest
this Polo, Bolo...?

36:55.060 --> 36:56.288
- Bolotov.
- Bolotov.

36:56.460 --> 36:59.497
Oh, a Russian son of a bitch!

37:00.020 --> 37:03.979
They don't know about the pistol.
It seems he has a good alibi.

37:04.140 --> 37:08.372
Is his timecard. He punched
out after the Cordell murder.

37:08.540 --> 37:12.055
- A friend could have done that.
- Yeah, true.

37:12.220 --> 37:14.415
- I still don't know why we're here.
- Well...

37:15.100 --> 37:19.093
This is where he works.
I'm gonna go have a talk with him.

37:25.580 --> 37:28.617
- Cool.
- Where are you going?

37:28.780 --> 37:32.295
You go after him, I pull you off.
Good cop, bad cop?

37:32.460 --> 37:37.170
- No. Stay with the car.
- Come on, man. Starsky and Putz.

37:37.820 --> 37:39.890
What are you expecting in there?

37:40.060 --> 37:44.895
Nothing. This is just for show.
Hold this. Thanks.

38:00.500 --> 38:01.694
Can I help you?

38:02.060 --> 38:04.369
My name is McCaleb.

38:05.660 --> 38:09.733
Following up the sheriff's department
investigation of February 3.

38:09.980 --> 38:14.053
Just a minute, please.

38:15.420 --> 38:20.414
Mr. Toliver? A Mr. McCaleb from
the sheriff's department is here.

38:21.860 --> 38:26.376
- We're awfully busy, Mr. McCaleb.
- I'll get right to the point, then.

38:26.540 --> 38:30.692
A few months ago, some deputies
asked you about an employee.

38:30.900 --> 38:32.253
- Bolotov?
- Yes.

38:32.420 --> 38:35.776
I'm on the case.
I'd like to get a few more points.

38:35.940 --> 38:37.578
I'll tell you what I told them.

38:37.780 --> 38:41.898
Bolotov was working that day.
You can see his timecards.

38:42.500 --> 38:45.936
How many employees
do you have here at one time?

38:46.100 --> 38:47.089
Eighty-five.

38:47.420 --> 38:51.936
Is it possible that one of them might
have punched his timecard for him?

38:52.260 --> 38:55.696
We've been in business 16 years.
Is happened.

38:55.900 --> 38:57.219
Is he here today?

38:58.900 --> 39:02.256
Yes, thas him over there.

39:03.500 --> 39:05.491
Bolotov. Thas Russian, right?

39:05.660 --> 39:08.220
They're good workers
and don't complain.

39:08.380 --> 39:10.575
They don't mind being paid shit.

39:10.740 --> 39:13.618
- I'd like to talk to him.
- In here?

39:13.780 --> 39:18.535
You want to maintain your cooperation
with the sheriff's office, don't you?

39:19.140 --> 39:21.608
Yeah, all right.

39:30.420 --> 39:33.332
Bolotov, up in the office.

39:45.300 --> 39:48.656
Mr. Bolotov.
Have a chair.

39:54.580 --> 39:58.334
Where were you on the night
of January 22?

39:58.620 --> 40:01.259
I told them before.
I worked that night.

40:01.420 --> 40:04.890
I know, but we know things
now that we didn't know then.

40:05.140 --> 40:06.971
What things?

40:07.140 --> 40:11.850
There was a burglary on Mason Street,
about four blocks from here.

40:12.020 --> 40:15.729
- Is that where you got the gun?
- What gun?

40:16.020 --> 40:20.059
And February 7, I suppose you
got an alibi for that night too.

40:20.740 --> 40:22.935
I don't know that night.

40:23.100 --> 40:24.419
'Course you do!

40:24.580 --> 40:29.290
Thas the night you went into Kang's
grocery store and killed two people.

40:29.460 --> 40:31.576
Who are you?

40:31.740 --> 40:35.813
You're not a cop.
Cops goes twos. Who are you?

40:36.500 --> 40:39.617
I'm the Lone Ranger. Now sit down.

40:50.940 --> 40:54.569
No badge. See? No cop.

40:56.220 --> 40:59.018
"Terrell McCaleb."

40:59.180 --> 41:01.933
Maybe one day, I pay you visit.

41:02.100 --> 41:03.215
Yes?

41:24.300 --> 41:27.531
Not now. I'll get back to him.

41:27.740 --> 41:30.891
Bolotov's alibi isn't solid.
Think about it.

41:31.140 --> 41:34.576
Even if you had a badge,
id be the wrong one.

41:34.860 --> 41:36.259
I like him for this.

41:36.420 --> 41:40.493
Bolotov's an ex-con. He could have
done that for any reason.

41:40.700 --> 41:43.055
- You should still put out a pickup.
- Got you a soda, Terr.

41:43.260 --> 41:46.332
- Who the hell are you?
- Buddy, Terry's partner.

41:46.500 --> 41:47.615
- Sort of.
- Great.

41:47.780 --> 41:49.930
Les get back to Bolotov.

41:50.100 --> 41:53.297
I've already sent a car to his
apartment. He's gone.

41:53.460 --> 41:55.655
- I hit a nerve.
- I'll say.

41:55.820 --> 41:59.256
Remember my lieutenant, who's
now my captain? He's unhappy.

41:59.420 --> 42:01.854
He doesn't want to hear
from you again.

42:02.020 --> 42:05.057
Terry has worked very hard on this.
We both have.

42:05.220 --> 42:07.734
- Sh...
- Shut up.

42:09.020 --> 42:10.248
Also...

42:10.420 --> 42:16.017
...he wants the tapes and murder
books back first thing in the morning.

42:16.340 --> 42:19.571
Will that give you enough
time to copy everything?

42:19.740 --> 42:22.334
I've already done that. Thanks.

42:22.500 --> 42:24.775
Go home, you look like crap.

42:24.940 --> 42:26.976
Wait a minute.

42:28.420 --> 42:33.448
Lip reader is 90% certain the shooter
was saying, "Happy Valentine's Day."

42:33.620 --> 42:35.258
Happy Valent...

42:35.420 --> 42:39.652
That doesn't sound like your average
three-strikes guy, does it?

42:40.020 --> 42:43.217
Whas the average these days?

42:44.860 --> 42:47.055
Not much, man.

42:58.940 --> 43:01.977
Happy Valentine's Day.

43:07.540 --> 43:10.259
GRACIELLA:
Do you see the boat?

43:10.420 --> 43:11.455
I told you.

43:12.860 --> 43:15.977
- How much homework do you have?
RAYMOND: Three questions.

43:16.340 --> 43:17.932
- Hey.
GRACIELLA: Hey.

43:18.900 --> 43:21.016
You forgot, didn't you?

43:21.180 --> 43:24.650
Sort of. I kind of got lost
the last couple hours.

43:24.820 --> 43:26.970
- We can do this another time.
- No.

43:27.140 --> 43:29.734
No, we're having dinner.
Come on up.

43:30.100 --> 43:32.489
- Is this Raymond?
- This is Raymond.

43:32.660 --> 43:35.128
This is the man I was
telling you about.

43:35.300 --> 43:38.770
<i>MCCALEB: How are you doing?
- Whas The Following Sea?</i>

43:38.940 --> 43:43.218
Thas the one that you have to
watch for, the one right behind you.

43:43.700 --> 43:48.216
- Where's the kitchen? I mean, galley?
MCCALEB: Right in here.

43:48.380 --> 43:51.292
- Can you fish off this boat?
- Yeah, you can.

43:51.460 --> 43:54.577
Come on back,
I'll get you a fishing pole.

44:03.140 --> 44:04.539
Jesus.

44:09.460 --> 44:12.054
I didn't want you to see that.

44:13.980 --> 44:16.016
Was she...?

44:16.820 --> 44:18.219
Was she ever scared?

44:18.900 --> 44:22.336
No, she never knew anything.

44:25.700 --> 44:28.772
What I've asked you to do,
it just isn't fair.

44:29.300 --> 44:31.211
Is it?

44:31.660 --> 44:36.176
There's a restaurant in the marina.
Good atmosphere, view of the sunset.

44:36.340 --> 44:39.377
Why don't I just take you
to dinner there.

44:45.300 --> 44:47.211
GRACIELLA:
Why do you live on a boat?

44:47.380 --> 44:49.974
MCCALEB:
I hate mowing lawns.

44:50.260 --> 44:52.012
Why do you live onshore?

44:52.180 --> 44:55.570
GRACIELLA: Because thas where
my warm, cozy apartment is.

44:56.220 --> 44:58.609
You were right, though.

44:59.220 --> 45:00.972
Is a great sunset.

45:01.660 --> 45:06.529
Yeah, you never get tired of it.
Does he stay with you?

45:08.340 --> 45:11.537
Yeah. His dad isn't around.

45:11.700 --> 45:15.898
He's a great kid. Your sister
must have been a good woman.

45:16.420 --> 45:18.376
Thank you.

45:19.220 --> 45:21.939
So how is it going, McCaleb?

45:22.420 --> 45:24.490
Any hope?

45:24.860 --> 45:27.454
Start thinking about your sister...

45:27.620 --> 45:31.579
...who her friends were,
where she went, all of her routines.

45:31.740 --> 45:35.938
- All right. How come?
- Thas just an angle I'm working on.

45:36.100 --> 45:38.409
Did she ever know a James Cordell?

45:38.580 --> 45:41.299
- Cordell?
- Yeah.

45:41.660 --> 45:42.649
No.

45:42.820 --> 45:45.129
- You sure?
- Positive. Why?

45:45.300 --> 45:48.178
It may be nothing.
It might be premature...

45:48.340 --> 45:51.093
You think this James Cordell
killed her.

45:51.300 --> 45:52.892
No, nothing like that.

45:53.060 --> 45:57.292
Stop, McCaleb, with the prematures
and the angles. What?

45:57.460 --> 46:02.409
Cordell was killed at an ATM machine
two weeks before your sister died.

46:02.580 --> 46:05.697
We think is the same gunman
in both cases.

46:05.860 --> 46:07.532
Why would she know Cordell?

46:07.700 --> 46:10.897
They were both in the wrong
place at the wrong time.

46:11.060 --> 46:14.575
This investigation's being conducted
under the theory...

46:14.740 --> 46:18.699
...that the locations were chosen
and the victims were random.

46:18.860 --> 46:23.934
Is the other way around. Is not
where thas important. Is who.

46:24.100 --> 46:27.888
- Gunman took money, so is robbery...
- Bear with me.

46:28.060 --> 46:30.938
Cordell and your sister
were connected.

46:31.100 --> 46:35.059
There's some intersecting link
between them and the killer.

46:35.700 --> 46:37.372
I'm not following you.

46:37.700 --> 46:42.296
At the Bureau, we used to call
this a full-field investigation.

46:42.460 --> 46:45.736
- Thas what I'm conducting here.
- Full-field investigation.

46:45.900 --> 46:47.299
Yeah.

46:48.020 --> 46:49.089
Okay.

46:49.860 --> 46:51.088
Come on!

46:57.460 --> 47:01.135
You know, there was one thing
thas always bothered me.

47:01.300 --> 47:02.972
- What?
- Nothing, but...

47:03.140 --> 47:04.209
What is it?

47:04.380 --> 47:08.976
Glory had this piece of jewelry she
always wore. Like a good-luck charm.

47:09.140 --> 47:14.453
She never took it off. When the police
brought me her effects, it was missing.

47:14.620 --> 47:15.609
What was it?

47:15.780 --> 47:19.978
It was a single earring,
a dangling crucifix.

47:24.060 --> 47:26.813
Okay. So, what does it mean?

47:27.700 --> 47:32.330
Nothing. Some killers take
souvenirs, I suppose.

47:34.020 --> 47:35.453
- Thas sick.
- Yeah.

47:35.620 --> 47:36.609
Are you okay?

47:36.780 --> 47:40.216
Yeah. I gotta get back to the boat
for my medicine.

47:40.380 --> 47:43.816
We have to get going too.
Raymond has some homework.

47:43.980 --> 47:44.969
Raymond?

47:45.140 --> 47:47.370
We've gotta go!

47:47.540 --> 47:49.929
Say thank you to Mr. McCaleb. Come!

47:50.100 --> 47:52.295
Thank you!

47:56.220 --> 47:58.415
- Give me that school bag.
- Okay.

47:58.580 --> 48:00.332
- Say thank you.
RAYMOND: Thank you.

48:00.500 --> 48:03.572
MCCALEB: See you later.
GRACIELLA: Give me the school bag.

48:08.980 --> 48:11.175
And he takes the earring.

48:12.820 --> 48:15.015
Hey, Buddy!

48:17.700 --> 48:19.179
Whas up?

48:19.380 --> 48:22.736
You're working tomorrow, 6 a.m.

48:22.980 --> 48:24.891
Cool. Whatever.

48:30.020 --> 48:33.092
BUDDY:
Who wants to go to the desert anyhow?

48:33.660 --> 48:35.412
We go where the clues lead.

48:35.780 --> 48:38.578
Don't any clues lead to the beach?

48:38.740 --> 48:43.860
They lead where they lead. Usually
pretty close to where they started.

48:46.980 --> 48:49.619
I have to ask, Terry.

48:50.140 --> 48:51.539
How did it feel?

48:51.940 --> 48:56.058
Back in the day, when you were
going up against all those sickos?

48:56.220 --> 48:57.699
That was my job.

48:57.860 --> 49:01.455
Come on, man. I mean,
driving a truck, thas a job.

49:01.620 --> 49:04.259
All those killers
you used to hunt down.

49:04.420 --> 49:09.699
I read in the paper some used to leave
you messages. That ain't truck driving.

49:09.860 --> 49:14.092
Only one, actually,
ever left me messages.

49:15.780 --> 49:19.056
Sorry, I'm sticking my nose
in it, I know.

49:19.220 --> 49:20.573
Connected.

49:21.140 --> 49:22.892
What?

49:23.060 --> 49:27.770
When I was at the top of my game,
I felt connected to everything.

49:28.020 --> 49:31.410
The victim, the killer,
the crime scene.

49:31.580 --> 49:33.298
Everything.

49:33.460 --> 49:39.296
Just felt like it was all part of me.
Is beginning to feel that way again.

49:39.780 --> 49:41.736
Cool.

49:43.700 --> 49:49.457
I'll tell you what. Driving is okay
because I would shit my shorts.

49:51.100 --> 49:52.852
I would.

49:53.020 --> 49:58.219
But thas why you're a famous cop
and I'm a boat bum. A loser.

49:58.900 --> 50:00.652
Buddy, you're not a loser.

50:00.820 --> 50:06.133
Is okay, Terry.
Only my mom has to tell me that.

50:06.300 --> 50:09.133
My friends can tell me the truth.

50:24.100 --> 50:25.169
Mrs. Cordell?

50:26.020 --> 50:28.250
I'm Terry McCaleb. I called you.

50:28.500 --> 50:30.411
Is this a bad time?

50:30.620 --> 50:35.250
- As opposed to a good time?
- Poor choice of words. Can we talk?

50:35.860 --> 50:38.010
Is that your partner in the car?

50:39.100 --> 50:42.251
Yeah.

50:42.660 --> 50:46.448
I wanted to hire an investigator,
but I couldn't afford to.

50:46.620 --> 50:49.293
Couldn't afford to find out
who killed him.

50:49.700 --> 50:51.213
You work for the police?

50:51.380 --> 50:53.450
No, I'm a retired FBI agent.

50:53.620 --> 50:57.898
I'm also a friend of the family
of the woman killed in Canoga Park.

50:58.060 --> 51:00.255
We think is the same gunman.

51:00.420 --> 51:01.694
I see.

51:02.260 --> 51:06.890
I'd like to tell you I'm sorry.
Thas hard coming from a stranger...

51:07.060 --> 51:11.133
...but I went through the files, and
James seemed like a good man.

51:11.580 --> 51:15.209
Funny hearing him called James.
Everyone called him Jimmy.

51:15.380 --> 51:17.769
And he was a very good man.

51:17.940 --> 51:20.659
How can I help, Mr. McCaleb?

51:21.540 --> 51:25.135
See this photograph?
Does this woman look familiar to you?

51:25.300 --> 51:28.815
- Is that someone he might have known?
- I don't think so.

51:29.020 --> 51:33.138
- Is that the victim from Canoga Park?
- Right.

51:33.300 --> 51:35.530
- Is that her son?
- Uh-huh.

51:36.620 --> 51:37.939
I don't understand.

51:38.100 --> 51:40.568
How could he know her?
Are you suggesting they...?

51:40.740 --> 51:44.050
- No, nothing like that.
- Then, like what?

51:44.660 --> 51:50.018
We think your husband and Miss Torres
may have crossed paths with the killer...

51:50.180 --> 51:55.459
...sort of the relationship between
the victim and the gunman.

51:55.620 --> 52:01.138
The smallest detail of them coming
in contact is very, very important.

52:01.300 --> 52:05.054
Something like dining at the same
restaurant, for instance.

52:05.340 --> 52:08.013
- A restaurant the killer went to?
- Yeah.

52:08.180 --> 52:11.092
That sounds like stalking,
not robbery.

52:11.260 --> 52:16.732
To be honest with you, we're not sure
robbery is the motive in this case.

52:17.420 --> 52:21.254
When they brought back his effects,
was it all there?

52:21.420 --> 52:24.173
Was anything missing?
Rings, watches?

52:24.340 --> 52:26.092
No.

52:26.500 --> 52:30.334
You're sure he couldn't have been
in the Valley two weeks before?

52:30.500 --> 52:35.335
No, he spent a month in Northern
California, working on the aqueduct.

52:35.500 --> 52:39.857
And when my husband wasn't
working, he was home with me.

52:40.020 --> 52:43.217
- Is that his car?
- Yes.

52:44.220 --> 52:46.415
Any personal effects in that?

52:46.580 --> 52:48.571
A picture on the dashboard.

52:48.740 --> 52:51.618
- Still there?
- I don't know. I would think.

52:51.780 --> 52:55.898
The sheriff's department drove
it home. I haven't been in it.

52:56.060 --> 52:58.255
Can I...?

53:05.580 --> 53:07.491
There it is.

53:07.660 --> 53:09.412
MCCALEB:
Right here, yeah.

53:09.580 --> 53:13.209
Any of this stuff your husbanďs
favorite knickknacks?

53:13.380 --> 53:14.369
No, sorry.

53:16.300 --> 53:20.179
Could you jot down your
husbanďs routines for me...?

53:20.340 --> 53:22.012
- His sunglasses.
- What?

53:22.180 --> 53:26.412
They hung from the mirror on a cord.
They're missing.

53:26.580 --> 53:27.899
What kind of glasses?

53:28.060 --> 53:31.370
They were Wayfarers.
He had them for years.

53:31.540 --> 53:34.896
- Wayfarers?
- What do you think it means?

53:35.540 --> 53:38.338
I said, what do you think it means?

53:38.980 --> 53:40.493
Probably nothing.

53:40.660 --> 53:44.733
Thanks, Mrs. Cordell.
I'll call you if anything comes up.

53:50.180 --> 53:53.377
Easy, Mac. Whas the matter?

53:54.780 --> 53:58.739
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

54:00.220 --> 54:02.575
I saw the killer, Buddy.

54:03.380 --> 54:07.055
At the bank, at the ATM,
where Cordell was killed.

54:07.860 --> 54:12.217
Wait a minute, thas crazy.
Thas the last place he would be.

54:12.380 --> 54:14.575
No, it fits the profile.

54:14.900 --> 54:17.368
Profile? What profile?

54:17.620 --> 54:21.215
Take me to the L.A. County
Sheriff's Office.

54:21.660 --> 54:26.688
No, wait! I don't get it.
Why would the killer go back?

54:29.020 --> 54:31.932
Okay. Never mind, I'll just drive.

54:35.540 --> 54:40.330
- Now you're starting to get it.
- This goes any longer, I want a raise.

54:40.700 --> 54:43.373
How about workmen's comp?

54:44.180 --> 54:47.729
Detective Winston's in the field.
Can I take a message?

54:47.900 --> 54:50.892
- Tell her McCaleb was by.
- Hey.

54:51.060 --> 54:54.689
She wanted to see you, Mr. McCaleb.

54:56.020 --> 54:57.339
How about that?

54:57.940 --> 54:59.817
Is McCaleb, Jaye.

54:59.980 --> 55:04.531
<i>WINSTON: I'm en route. You should get
yourself down here ASAP.</i>

55:04.900 --> 55:06.731
What was that first part?

55:06.900 --> 55:10.210
<i>I said, we've got Bolotov.</i>

55:27.460 --> 55:29.849
- Stay there, Buddy.
- This sucks!

55:30.020 --> 55:34.252
Trash collectors found him.
We think he's been here since early a.m.

55:34.420 --> 55:37.571
- What are they doing here?
- This alley is the line.

55:37.740 --> 55:38.729
The line?

55:38.900 --> 55:41.972
South side's L.A.P.D.,
north is sheriff's department.

55:42.140 --> 55:44.893
We're not sure who
has jurisdiction yet.

55:50.180 --> 55:52.057
Congratulations, old man!

55:52.220 --> 55:56.179
You shook him out of his tree.
Dumb bastard killed himself.

55:56.340 --> 55:57.773
H&K 9mm.

55:57.940 --> 56:01.376
Same as both murders.
I bet ballistics confirms it.

56:04.020 --> 56:08.491
- What are you talking about?
- He's saying this case is closed.

56:08.660 --> 56:10.969
Bolotov, he doesn't fit the profile.

56:11.140 --> 56:13.449
- Of what?
- A serial killer.

56:13.620 --> 56:14.655
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

56:14.820 --> 56:18.096
This guy stalks his victims
and kills them on camera...

56:18.260 --> 56:22.538
...then he takes trophy items.
- What are you talking about?

56:22.700 --> 56:26.249
I was at the ATM crime scene.
The killer was behind me.

56:26.420 --> 56:30.572
He had Cordell's glasses on,
and he had Gloria Torres' earring.

56:30.740 --> 56:33.777
Did they look like these?

56:33.940 --> 56:37.012
This? And this?

56:37.620 --> 56:41.772
I don't care what you call him.
We got him.

56:44.540 --> 56:48.055
- I don't know, his hair was long.
- Maybe it was a wig?

56:48.220 --> 56:49.938
Maybe.

56:50.100 --> 56:53.058
- You wanna sit down?
- I'm fine, goddamn it.

56:53.220 --> 56:57.179
- Why don't you lay down?
- Arrango, shut up!

57:01.060 --> 57:04.257
There's something in his mouth.

57:06.980 --> 57:10.973
- Is a bullet.
- No way it came from a 9mm.

57:12.340 --> 57:16.379
- Looks like a.38 to me.
- Why'd he put a.38 slug in his mouth?

57:16.540 --> 57:19.373
Same reason he died
on the jurisdiction line.

57:19.540 --> 57:21.929
Somebody's trying to jerk us all off.

57:22.100 --> 57:24.819
Personally, I like being jerked off.

57:25.020 --> 57:27.090
This case is closed in my book.

57:27.300 --> 57:30.098
You're just worried, aren't you?

57:30.260 --> 57:32.057
- Worried?
- Yeah.

57:32.220 --> 57:33.289
About what?

57:33.460 --> 57:37.931
That I might bust this case.
You don't care who gets hurt or killed.

57:38.100 --> 57:43.049
- As long as I don't bust the case.
- What the fuck is it to you anyway?

57:43.220 --> 57:46.849
Gloria Torres, that victim
you didn't give a shit about?

57:47.020 --> 57:49.693
I've got her heart. Thas what.
Thas right.

57:49.980 --> 57:53.734
I'm alive because she's dead.
That puts me in this bigtime.

57:53.900 --> 57:58.610
You're an asshole, and you can't help
it, but I'm on this case for a while.

57:58.780 --> 58:00.975
I'll be along until we get him.

58:01.140 --> 58:05.736
I don't care whether is you, him
or whoever. I'm in this.

58:06.140 --> 58:09.610
Stay out of my city!
Go get yourself a dick transplant!

58:09.780 --> 58:12.817
Conflict of interest.

58:12.980 --> 58:15.972
- Ever think about that?
MCCALEB: Pain in the ass.

58:17.420 --> 58:21.413
- How much do I owe you?
- I don't know, 200 or so.

58:21.580 --> 58:23.696
That sounds right.

58:26.100 --> 58:29.456
- Take a check?
- Yeah, sure.

58:29.620 --> 58:32.339
You look like shit.
You should take a nap.

58:32.500 --> 58:35.253
Yeah, thanks. I will.

58:35.420 --> 58:41.450
- Who do I make it out to? Buddy?
- Jasper. Jasper Noone. N-O-O-N-E.

58:41.620 --> 58:44.692
I know the Noone part. But Jasper?

58:44.860 --> 58:47.420
I look more like a Buddy
than a Jasper, huh?

58:47.580 --> 58:49.411
Yeah.

58:50.500 --> 58:52.730
Take a nap.

59:02.530 --> 59:08.048
GRACIELLA: Ray, stay here. Be careful
of the edges. I'll be right out.

59:08.250 --> 59:11.481
MCCALEB: Hi.
- Hey.

59:12.970 --> 59:15.928
So is it true?

59:16.330 --> 59:17.365
What?

59:17.890 --> 59:22.008
I heard it on the news. They said
that they found a Russian man...

59:22.170 --> 59:23.922
...who may be the killer.

59:24.090 --> 59:25.364
I don't know.

59:25.530 --> 59:29.079
I don't think so, but I don't know.

59:29.250 --> 59:33.926
They said they had evidence that
could link this guy to both murders.

59:34.170 --> 59:37.401
That may just be two cops
trying to grab headlines.

59:37.570 --> 59:39.322
I don't know. Sorry.

59:39.490 --> 59:42.084
You're starting to sound like L.A.P.D.

59:42.730 --> 59:44.925
I need some answers.

59:45.090 --> 59:46.728
Because no one knows...

59:46.890 --> 59:52.408
No one has a clue what that boy goes
through every night without his mother.

59:52.570 --> 59:54.686
I'm sorry.

01:00:00.890 --> 01:00:03.802
I did what you asked.

01:00:05.210 --> 01:00:07.963
I made a list of all
of Glory's routines.

01:00:08.130 --> 01:00:09.848
Thas good.

01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:15.920
She used to go to that market
almost every night.

01:00:16.090 --> 01:00:19.127
She'd take Raymond
to McDonalďs a lot. Too much.

01:00:19.530 --> 01:00:22.647
The one on Ventura and Reseda.

01:00:22.810 --> 01:00:27.645
And she would go bowling,
but not lately.

01:00:27.810 --> 01:00:30.449
She used to visit an aunt
every Thursday...

01:00:30.850 --> 01:00:34.684
...because our aunt was in a
nursing home in Culver City.

01:00:34.850 --> 01:00:38.525
Like a responsible person,
she never missed a day of work.

01:00:38.690 --> 01:00:42.080
She gave blood every month,
took her son to school...

01:00:42.250 --> 01:00:44.923
...and I wanna understand
why she was killed!

01:00:45.090 --> 01:00:46.079
What?

01:00:47.250 --> 01:00:48.729
She gave blood?

01:00:48.970 --> 01:00:53.043
Yes, McCaleb. She's the same
blood type as you are.

01:00:53.210 --> 01:00:55.166
AB with a CMV negative.

01:00:55.330 --> 01:00:59.323
The hospital would have paid her,
but she wouldn't accept money.

01:00:59.610 --> 01:01:02.966
- Thas the connection!
- What are you talking about?

01:01:03.130 --> 01:01:06.679
Thas the link between Cordell
and your sister. Blood.

01:01:07.170 --> 01:01:09.559
Wait a minute. Blood?

01:01:16.570 --> 01:01:18.959
I'll cover tomorrow's shift.

01:01:19.130 --> 01:01:21.598
Yeah, thanks.

01:01:22.650 --> 01:01:26.245
- Don't you ever use a cell phone?
- I don't believe in them.

01:01:26.410 --> 01:01:30.005
I always stay with a hard line.
Mrs. Cordell wasn't home.

01:01:30.410 --> 01:01:32.560
Is there another way to find out?

01:01:32.730 --> 01:01:35.608
If he gave blood often,
he'd be on the computer.

01:01:35.770 --> 01:01:38.125
- Which computer?
- The BOPRA computer.

01:01:38.290 --> 01:01:41.566
For rare blood types.
There's one at L.A. Memorial.

01:01:41.730 --> 01:01:46.360
- All right. I'm coming with you.
- Get somebody to stay with the kid.

01:01:47.130 --> 01:01:49.041
MCCALEB:
What do you think?

01:01:49.210 --> 01:01:51.804
What do you mean, babysitting?

01:01:51.970 --> 01:01:53.119
MCCALEB: Yeah.
- Fuck me.

01:01:53.290 --> 01:01:54.325
How much?

01:01:54.490 --> 01:01:58.085
I don't know. Beer.
A case of beer an hour.

01:01:58.250 --> 01:02:00.286
You got it.

01:02:11.490 --> 01:02:15.529
MAN: They said some kind of blockage.
In about an hour.

01:02:15.690 --> 01:02:17.840
MCCALEB:
Hey, doc.

01:02:18.010 --> 01:02:19.966
Terry. Whas wrong?

01:02:20.130 --> 01:02:23.361
Nothing. Is there a place
we could talk privately?

01:02:23.530 --> 01:02:25.407
I need to talk to you.

01:02:30.850 --> 01:02:33.489
You have five minutes.

01:02:34.970 --> 01:02:36.005
Who's this?

01:02:36.170 --> 01:02:38.889
Graciella Rivers,
the one I told you about.

01:02:39.050 --> 01:02:43.760
She's the one who put you up to this.
Look at him. Look at his color.

01:02:43.930 --> 01:02:48.003
Look at the lines under his eyes.
A week ago, he was perfect.

01:02:48.170 --> 01:02:50.161
- I am sorry.
- It was my choice.

01:02:50.330 --> 01:02:53.242
Shut up! Sit down.

01:02:53.410 --> 01:02:55.480
Open your mouth.

01:02:57.410 --> 01:02:59.719
Lift your shirt up.

01:03:09.290 --> 01:03:12.088
- What do you want?
- We wanted to know...

01:03:12.250 --> 01:03:16.926
- Keep that thermometer in your mouth.
- My sister was murdered.

01:03:17.090 --> 01:03:18.808
So was another man.

01:03:18.970 --> 01:03:21.359
It was the same killer.

01:03:21.530 --> 01:03:25.159
McCaleb found a link between
my sister and this other man.

01:03:25.330 --> 01:03:27.969
- They both gave blood.
- What?

01:03:28.130 --> 01:03:32.123
She was the same blood type
as McCaleb, AB with CMV negative.

01:03:32.290 --> 01:03:35.566
McCaleb says thas 1 in 200.

01:03:39.050 --> 01:03:42.440
101. 1. Shit.

01:03:43.930 --> 01:03:45.522
What do you want?

01:03:45.690 --> 01:03:48.250
I want you to access
the BOPRA computer.

01:03:48.410 --> 01:03:51.561
If Cordell's on it,
I wanna know his blood type.

01:03:51.730 --> 01:03:52.879
Thas unethical.

01:03:53.050 --> 01:03:57.407
You've gotta help. If I'm right,
the killer already has access.

01:03:57.770 --> 01:03:58.998
I don't know...

01:03:59.170 --> 01:04:03.448
If you can't protect the integrity
of the system, there's no system.

01:04:03.770 --> 01:04:04.839
All right.

01:04:05.050 --> 01:04:07.041
I'll do it on one condition.

01:04:07.290 --> 01:04:08.405
Whas that?

01:04:08.570 --> 01:04:10.561
Let me run blood work on you.

01:04:10.730 --> 01:04:14.518
- That will take all day!
- Yes or no?

01:04:15.490 --> 01:04:18.323
- Yes.
- Sit down.

01:04:19.530 --> 01:04:21.725
I'll get the nurse.

01:04:26.050 --> 01:04:27.529
MAN:
Very still now.

01:04:27.770 --> 01:04:30.045
WOMAN:
We're almost done.

01:04:38.090 --> 01:04:41.048
I want you to stop, McCaleb.

01:04:43.890 --> 01:04:45.721
Stop what?

01:04:46.810 --> 01:04:48.766
Everything.

01:04:48.930 --> 01:04:51.205
I was wrong to bring this to you.

01:04:51.370 --> 01:04:52.564
No.

01:04:52.730 --> 01:04:54.482
Yeah.

01:04:55.650 --> 01:04:57.800
Glory gave another person life.

01:04:57.970 --> 01:05:01.599
- Thas really all I need to know.
- No.

01:05:01.770 --> 01:05:04.125
Look, I got a new heart, but...

01:05:04.290 --> 01:05:07.760
...I didn't necessarily
get a new life.

01:05:07.930 --> 01:05:10.569
I don't know what you mean.

01:05:10.850 --> 01:05:13.284
I lost a little something...

01:05:13.450 --> 01:05:16.567
...but knowing you and
working with you on this...

01:05:16.730 --> 01:05:19.642
...I feel a little bit coming back.

01:05:24.170 --> 01:05:25.205
Okay.

01:05:25.370 --> 01:05:29.249
Is a list of the local AB CMV
negatives. Cordell's on it.

01:05:29.410 --> 01:05:31.446
Same blood type as Torres.

01:05:31.610 --> 01:05:33.840
Whas the D stand for? Deceased?

01:05:34.010 --> 01:05:37.320
No, donor. Organ donor.
They were both organ donors.

01:05:37.730 --> 01:05:39.482
Both organ donors?

01:05:39.650 --> 01:05:43.404
Cordell died on the scene,
and Gloria lived just long enough.

01:05:43.570 --> 01:05:46.004
- Thas crazy.
- What are you saying?

01:05:46.250 --> 01:05:47.603
I missed it, damn it.

01:05:47.770 --> 01:05:52.082
I didn't think Gloria had anything
anyone wanted, but I missed it.

01:05:52.410 --> 01:05:54.480
What did you miss?

01:05:54.650 --> 01:05:56.845
FOX:
Her blood.

01:05:57.050 --> 01:05:59.041
It made her unique.

01:05:59.210 --> 01:06:02.759
It made what was inside her
very valuable. To someone.

01:06:02.930 --> 01:06:08.607
Someone like me. Anyone who could
benefit would be a suspect.

01:06:09.850 --> 01:06:14.162
Wait a minute. You're saying that
she was murdered for her organs.

01:06:14.570 --> 01:06:18.882
The autopsy report had both
bullets going through the frontal lobe.

01:06:19.050 --> 01:06:22.645
That could leave them brain dead,
but not die right away.

01:06:22.810 --> 01:06:28.646
Of course, Cordell... 911 screwed up,
but your sister had the Good Samaritan.

01:06:28.810 --> 01:06:30.641
Who?

01:06:30.970 --> 01:06:37.079
Thas the customer who came in,
bandaged her head and called 911.

01:06:37.250 --> 01:06:40.322
- You can't get back until...
- Can I use your phone?

01:06:40.490 --> 01:06:44.961
- Terry...
- Get a list of where the organs went.

01:06:45.130 --> 01:06:46.119
GRACIELLA:
Terry.

01:06:56.650 --> 01:06:58.163
Detective Jaye Winston?

01:06:58.330 --> 01:07:02.801
Graciella Rivers. He's inside talking
about surveillance and numbers.

01:07:03.210 --> 01:07:05.849
This is Arrango from
West Valley Homicide.

01:07:06.010 --> 01:07:11.004
Badge 14110. I'd like a 10-20
for a surveillance commencement.

01:07:11.170 --> 01:07:13.240
<i>WOMAN:
Thas 17: 14:39.</i>

01:07:13.410 --> 01:07:15.446
Thank you. 17: 14:39.

01:07:15.610 --> 01:07:19.285
I'm out of my jurisdiction,
and you're way out. Whas up?

01:07:19.530 --> 01:07:23.569
The surveillance camera's three
seconds behind the CCW clock.

01:07:23.730 --> 01:07:27.609
- Thas the one 911 uses.
- Okay, so?

01:07:27.770 --> 01:07:30.443
So did you bring the tape?

01:07:33.610 --> 01:07:35.601
<i>OPERATOR:
This is the 911 operator.</i>

01:07:35.770 --> 01:07:38.682
<i>MAN: The girl is shot very bad!
She needs help!</i>

01:07:38.850 --> 01:07:40.249
<i>OPERATOR:
Who was shot, sir?</i>

01:07:40.410 --> 01:07:43.447
<i>MAN: The girl is shot!
Kang's Market, Sherman Way!</i>

01:07:43.610 --> 01:07:46.363
<i>OPERATOR:
Sir, please stay on the line.</i>

01:07:52.250 --> 01:07:55.447
Thas 10:40:58.

01:08:11.130 --> 01:08:13.883
All right. At 22:41:37...

01:08:14.050 --> 01:08:17.929
...Gloria is shot.

01:08:19.170 --> 01:08:21.399
Jump down to...

01:08:21.569 --> 01:08:26.484
...22:42:55, and here comes
Good Samaritan.

01:08:26.649 --> 01:08:29.288
That son of a bitch.

01:08:29.450 --> 01:08:32.567
What? What is it?

01:08:32.729 --> 01:08:34.402
This guy here...

01:08:34.569 --> 01:08:38.358
...this unidentified Good Samaritan,
who tried to help Gloria.

01:08:38.529 --> 01:08:40.087
There's just one problem.

01:08:40.250 --> 01:08:42.639
Whas that?

01:08:42.810 --> 01:08:47.837
The clock on the surveillance camera
is three seconds behind the 911 clock.

01:08:48.010 --> 01:08:50.240
All right, and...?

01:08:50.410 --> 01:08:54.926
We think he made the call
before he killed her.

01:08:56.410 --> 01:08:57.889
No.

01:08:58.050 --> 01:09:02.042
No, that doesn't make any sense,
because the numbers...

01:09:03.170 --> 01:09:05.126
Wait a minute.

01:09:06.649 --> 01:09:08.765
The caller.

01:09:10.810 --> 01:09:12.129
Is the same guy.

01:09:12.569 --> 01:09:16.483
He called an ambulance
before he shot her.

01:09:16.649 --> 01:09:18.322
Yeah.

01:09:18.490 --> 01:09:21.607
See, Cordell, his organs
were no good.

01:09:21.770 --> 01:09:27.606
This time, the shooter would make
sure the ambulance got a good lead.

01:09:27.770 --> 01:09:31.444
So he shot Gloria, then
he comes back with bandages...

01:09:31.609 --> 01:09:34.078
...and tries to keep her alive.

01:09:35.490 --> 01:09:37.879
Oh, my God.

01:09:40.649 --> 01:09:42.049
Okay.

01:09:42.210 --> 01:09:47.807
Could this Good Samaritan be the same
guy you saw at the ATM machine?

01:09:49.609 --> 01:09:52.727
I don't know.
Put a wig on him, maybe.

01:09:53.170 --> 01:09:55.445
A little dark makeup, he's Hispanic.

01:09:55.930 --> 01:09:57.682
You got those ATM tapes?

01:09:57.850 --> 01:10:00.887
No. You only told me
to bring this one.

01:10:01.210 --> 01:10:04.088
Yeah, well...

01:10:05.130 --> 01:10:09.282
The ATM thing. The shooter probably
had them on the way anyway.

01:10:09.450 --> 01:10:12.806
They went to the wrong address,
so it doesn't matter.

01:10:13.410 --> 01:10:16.288
What do you think about
Lockridge for this?

01:10:16.450 --> 01:10:18.202
I don't know, maybe.

01:10:19.330 --> 01:10:24.484
Whoever got the list of organ donors
had to hack into the BOPRA computer.

01:10:24.650 --> 01:10:26.766
Lockridge is a computer man, right?

01:10:26.930 --> 01:10:30.479
And he lives and works in
my jurisdiction. Les go.

01:10:34.810 --> 01:10:36.289
GRACIELLA:
I have to go with you.

01:10:36.450 --> 01:10:40.728
No, get back to Raymond.
Take my car. I'll go with Jaye.

01:10:57.410 --> 01:10:59.924
Why don't you pop the trunk?
I'll put this stuff in the back.

01:11:00.090 --> 01:11:01.284
Okay.

01:11:13.730 --> 01:11:15.607
What the fuck is he doing?

01:11:21.250 --> 01:11:24.481
McCaleb! What are you doing?!

01:11:24.770 --> 01:11:27.443
You're killing me here.
Whas going on?

01:12:12.730 --> 01:12:15.642
- You okay?
- Yeah. You okay?

01:12:15.810 --> 01:12:19.405
- Yeah.
- Les go find Lockridge at work.

01:12:19.570 --> 01:12:22.562
What do you mean?
We just shot up the Valley.

01:12:22.730 --> 01:12:23.640
Did you hit anyone?

01:12:23.810 --> 01:12:27.325
- No, thank God.
- Neither did I. Les go.

01:12:28.490 --> 01:12:29.764
Fuck.

01:12:30.650 --> 01:12:33.323
Mr. Lockridge didn't
come to work today.

01:12:33.490 --> 01:12:35.879
- Is he ill?
- He hasn't called...

01:12:36.290 --> 01:12:39.123
...and he didn't come
in yesterday either.

01:12:51.850 --> 01:12:54.683
Come here and look at this.

01:12:59.130 --> 01:13:01.928
Doesn't that look like
probable cause to you?

01:13:02.090 --> 01:13:03.682
Les go.

01:13:03.890 --> 01:13:06.643
See if I remember how they did this.

01:13:11.770 --> 01:13:13.647
Shit.

01:13:21.970 --> 01:13:23.483
Her throas been slit.

01:13:23.810 --> 01:13:26.882
She's been here a good 24 hours.

01:13:31.250 --> 01:13:33.127
WINSTON:
You okay?

01:13:33.410 --> 01:13:35.287
Yeah.

01:13:35.450 --> 01:13:39.284
We got an APB out on Lockridge.

01:13:39.450 --> 01:13:43.523
I might get suspended,
but you did real good, McCaleb.

01:13:43.690 --> 01:13:44.679
Real good.

01:13:44.850 --> 01:13:47.125
I hope so.

01:13:53.810 --> 01:13:57.883
I guess I'd better get home
and get my pills.

01:13:58.250 --> 01:13:59.922
Want some coffee?

01:14:02.370 --> 01:14:05.248
No, go home. Get your pills.

01:14:13.050 --> 01:14:15.484
You still got company.

01:14:16.250 --> 01:14:18.320
How much beer do I owe you?

01:14:18.490 --> 01:14:19.479
Seven cases...

01:14:19.650 --> 01:14:23.802
...but since he's a good kid
and a great fisherman, I'll take two.

01:14:23.970 --> 01:14:26.438
I'll get you the check in the morning.

01:14:26.610 --> 01:14:29.522
Thas what they all say.

01:14:31.170 --> 01:14:33.365
Good night, Terry.

01:14:42.090 --> 01:14:43.603
MCCALEB: Hey.
- Hey, Mr. McCaleb.

01:14:43.770 --> 01:14:45.123
MCCALEB:
Howdy.

01:14:45.290 --> 01:14:46.689
GRACIELLA: Hey.
MCCALEB: How are you?

01:14:46.850 --> 01:14:50.763
Me and Buddy caught so many fish
he had to get more bait.

01:14:51.090 --> 01:14:55.880
- I caught six all by myself.
- Really? It must be a harbor record.

01:14:56.050 --> 01:14:59.247
Is "Buddy and I."
Finish your homework, Ray.

01:15:02.010 --> 01:15:03.921
So?

01:15:04.410 --> 01:15:06.924
I'm not sure yet,
but is looking good.

01:15:07.090 --> 01:15:09.399
Okay. When will you know?

01:15:11.250 --> 01:15:13.810
Soon, hopefully.

01:15:17.930 --> 01:15:19.761
Thank you.

01:15:20.490 --> 01:15:22.446
For everything you've done.

01:15:22.610 --> 01:15:23.759
I'm impressed.

01:15:24.890 --> 01:15:27.085
GRACIELLA:
Thas my dad.

01:15:27.250 --> 01:15:31.129
He used to take Glory and me fishing.

01:15:31.290 --> 01:15:32.564
A lot.

01:15:32.730 --> 01:15:34.163
When we were kids.

01:15:34.530 --> 01:15:37.363
You know, they're all gone.

01:15:38.650 --> 01:15:42.529
But I'm glad I can still smile
about her, you know?

01:15:43.410 --> 01:15:45.207
I couldn't at first.

01:15:45.370 --> 01:15:48.203
This is a cool gun, Mr. McCaleb.

01:15:49.490 --> 01:15:51.640
Oh, shit...

01:15:52.170 --> 01:15:54.559
GRACIELLA: Raymond...
- Is all over. Don't, no.

01:15:56.370 --> 01:15:59.282
You never, never touch a gun.

01:15:59.450 --> 01:16:01.918
See? You can look at it.

01:16:02.290 --> 01:16:05.168
This is an eight-shot
Smith & Wesson.

01:16:05.330 --> 01:16:08.367
We don't touch it.
I shouldn't have left it out.

01:16:08.530 --> 01:16:12.409
You never play with this,
so stay right there. Understand?

01:16:14.850 --> 01:16:16.886
Whas this?

01:16:19.530 --> 01:16:24.524
Oh, thas some code I was supposed
to break, but I never could do it.

01:16:30.330 --> 01:16:32.969
- There's no one.
- What?

01:16:33.530 --> 01:16:34.758
There's no 1.

01:16:35.330 --> 01:16:38.527
"9-0-3-4-7-2-5-6-8."

01:16:38.690 --> 01:16:40.487
Is all the numbers, but no 1.

01:16:40.690 --> 01:16:43.727
How about that? No 1 s.

01:16:43.930 --> 01:16:47.718
Little man, come on.
We have to go. Is getting late.

01:16:47.890 --> 01:16:50.085
- Can I stay?
GRACIELLA: No.

01:16:50.250 --> 01:16:54.243
- We gotta go. Is getting late.
- I don't want to.

01:16:54.410 --> 01:16:57.288
We have to. Okay?

01:16:57.450 --> 01:17:01.204
Were you just going to let me
sit here and eat alone?

01:17:04.770 --> 01:17:10.322
Raymond loves this boat, and he was
wondering if he could spend the night.

01:17:10.490 --> 01:17:14.165
Yeah, there's a berth in front
you can both share.

01:17:51.090 --> 01:17:53.604
You don't have to hide it.

01:18:16.650 --> 01:18:19.118
Show me your heart.

01:18:19.650 --> 01:18:21.641
Show me.

01:18:37.170 --> 01:18:40.560
- Somebody's up on deck.
- Whas wrong?

01:18:40.970 --> 01:18:44.406
- I don't know. Somebody's up there.
- Raymond.

01:18:44.570 --> 01:18:47.721
No, too heavy for him.

01:19:15.970 --> 01:19:19.565
- You son of a bitch!
MCCALEB: What the hell is going on?

01:19:20.170 --> 01:19:24.686
Jesus Christ! We came because the
captain wants you at the crime scene.

01:19:25.090 --> 01:19:26.443
ARRANGO:
When this is over...

01:19:27.290 --> 01:19:31.886
...you better get an ass transplant
because I'll tear you a new one!

01:19:32.050 --> 01:19:33.688
Damn, is cold.

01:19:37.490 --> 01:19:38.923
ARRANGO:
Out of the way, please.

01:19:39.090 --> 01:19:42.685
There's McCaleb. Mr. McCaleb,
did you think this was over?

01:19:42.850 --> 01:19:46.479
I can't comment, I don't know
anything about anything.

01:19:47.810 --> 01:19:50.005
- Oh, no.
- What?

01:19:52.690 --> 01:19:55.523
This is where I had my attack.

01:20:02.690 --> 01:20:04.806
Lockridge.

01:20:05.410 --> 01:20:09.767
James Lockridge, the guy who
found Cordell at the ATM machine.

01:20:10.090 --> 01:20:12.809
Looks like your Code Killer's back.

01:20:15.530 --> 01:20:19.921
Happy Valentine's Day.
Way to make a comeback.

01:20:20.090 --> 01:20:23.446
Some people get flowers,
some people get chocolates.

01:20:23.890 --> 01:20:26.165
You get a dead guy.

01:20:31.370 --> 01:20:35.158
Mr. McCaleb.
Do you think is the Code Killer?

01:20:43.010 --> 01:20:44.682
WOMAN: Hey!
MAN: Whas going on?

01:20:49.410 --> 01:20:51.082
MAN:
Is all right.

01:21:02.770 --> 01:21:05.204
Paper said something you didn't like?

01:21:07.890 --> 01:21:11.883
Ballistics will match this slug
with the one in Bolotov's mouth.

01:21:12.050 --> 01:21:16.726
It was the Code Killer.
Torres, Cordell, Bolotov, all of them.

01:21:16.890 --> 01:21:18.721
What does that mean?

01:21:18.930 --> 01:21:23.924
I shot him two years ago. The slug in
Bolotov's mouth is the one that hit him.

01:21:24.090 --> 01:21:25.967
Now I'm back...

01:21:26.130 --> 01:21:28.041
...and so is he.

01:21:28.210 --> 01:21:33.648
Every second we're talking, you could
be trying to get this son of a bitch.

01:21:33.810 --> 01:21:36.244
We got a lot of good
people out there.

01:21:36.410 --> 01:21:37.399
You're right.

01:21:37.570 --> 01:21:41.483
Better chance of breaking
this with you in here.

01:21:41.650 --> 01:21:45.086
- Fuck you, Bureau man!
- Enough of that, detective.

01:21:45.290 --> 01:21:47.520
ARRANGO: Yes, sir.
- McCaleb.

01:21:48.210 --> 01:21:53.204
This Code Killer likes to impress you.
Any idea why?

01:21:53.930 --> 01:21:56.842
I had a media profile, so did he.

01:21:57.010 --> 01:22:01.162
I guess he missed the matchup, me
and him on the news every night.

01:22:01.330 --> 01:22:04.481
I thought once these guys started,
they didn't stop.

01:22:04.650 --> 01:22:07.210
But your Codie's been
down for two years.

01:22:07.370 --> 01:22:09.361
What do you make of that?

01:22:09.530 --> 01:22:13.921
I don't know. I shot him. I always
figured he crawled off and died.

01:22:14.090 --> 01:22:17.560
- What do the numbers mean?
- Don't know that either.

01:22:17.730 --> 01:22:22.440
We ran it by the computers at Cal,
by the code breakers at the NSA.

01:22:22.610 --> 01:22:24.760
Nobody comes up with anything.

01:22:24.930 --> 01:22:25.919
Except...

01:22:26.250 --> 01:22:28.605
Except what?

01:22:29.170 --> 01:22:31.240
There's no digit number one.

01:22:31.410 --> 01:22:34.447
No 1, whatever that might mean.

01:22:34.610 --> 01:22:37.647
Guys, step out. Give us a minute.

01:22:43.770 --> 01:22:45.362
Okay.

01:22:45.530 --> 01:22:49.000
Just cop to cop, whas going on here?

01:22:49.170 --> 01:22:53.322
Cordell, Gloria Torres...
He did them for me.

01:22:53.490 --> 01:22:56.527
Keep talking until I understand.

01:22:57.090 --> 01:22:59.763
He missed the action. Me and him.

01:22:59.930 --> 01:23:03.684
In order to get it back,
I needed a new heart, so...

01:23:03.850 --> 01:23:06.523
...Happy Valentine's Day.

01:23:07.010 --> 01:23:09.046
Holy shit.

01:23:09.210 --> 01:23:13.408
Now the love letters are gonna start,
hot and heavy.

01:23:19.570 --> 01:23:22.926
You might have the captain fooled,
but not me.

01:23:23.090 --> 01:23:26.685
You got Torres' heart.
That makes you suspect number one.

01:23:26.850 --> 01:23:30.286
What a waste of a good
Mexican's heart!

01:23:32.330 --> 01:23:33.729
Get out of here.

01:23:40.130 --> 01:23:42.280
Graciella?

01:23:44.890 --> 01:23:46.801
Raymond?

01:24:32.970 --> 01:24:37.088
Hey, Ter!
Welcome to Davy Jones' locker.

01:24:40.010 --> 01:24:42.399
Have you seen Graciella and Raymond?

01:24:43.170 --> 01:24:47.129
They got tired of waiting for you.
They left about an hour ago.

01:24:49.570 --> 01:24:52.243
You're all over the news, brother!

01:24:58.810 --> 01:25:01.404
How long we been neighbors?

01:25:01.570 --> 01:25:05.848
I don't know. I moved into the marina
about a week after you.

01:25:13.210 --> 01:25:16.407
- Raise up your shirt.
- What?

01:25:16.770 --> 01:25:18.920
Raise it up.

01:25:21.410 --> 01:25:23.526
Now.

01:25:36.130 --> 01:25:39.281
Come on, turn around.

01:25:45.610 --> 01:25:48.886
I'm the following sea, man.

01:25:49.050 --> 01:25:51.848
I'm the one you need to watch out for.

01:25:52.610 --> 01:25:55.249
When did you figure it out?

01:25:57.610 --> 01:25:59.601
On the check.

01:26:01.050 --> 01:26:03.041
"No one."

01:26:03.970 --> 01:26:07.485
I had a little trouble
with the Jasper part.

01:26:08.810 --> 01:26:10.368
Oh.

01:26:12.250 --> 01:26:16.766
I coulďve killed you if I wanted to.
I was behind you at the ATM.

01:26:16.930 --> 01:26:21.481
I followed you to Kang's Market,
just like I followed Gloria Torres.

01:26:21.650 --> 01:26:23.766
You sick son of a bitch.

01:26:24.290 --> 01:26:26.929
I studied her. I chose her.

01:26:27.090 --> 01:26:29.365
She was my valentine to you.

01:26:29.610 --> 01:26:31.248
I gave you life.

01:26:31.770 --> 01:26:33.442
What else you wanna know?

01:26:33.610 --> 01:26:38.206
That necklace belonged to a girl
named Sunny. Lockridge's wife.

01:26:38.370 --> 01:26:41.442
When Sunny gets blue,
I slit her throat.

01:26:43.610 --> 01:26:47.205
There's a story for every piece
of crap on that tray.

01:26:47.370 --> 01:26:49.964
Come on, man.
You're mine forever.

01:26:50.130 --> 01:26:52.519
Every breath you take belongs to me.

01:26:52.690 --> 01:26:58.287
Every beat of that stolen heart is
the echo of my voice in your head.

01:26:58.890 --> 01:27:00.209
Every day.

01:27:00.850 --> 01:27:02.283
Always.

01:27:02.530 --> 01:27:06.682
It depends on you. Pull that trigger,
you'll never see them again.

01:27:06.850 --> 01:27:11.605
- What?
- Kill me, no one will find them.

01:27:11.810 --> 01:27:14.768
They will die. Alone.

01:27:14.930 --> 01:27:19.287
In a black hole.
And that will be on you.

01:27:20.570 --> 01:27:24.688
You know me. You know I have them.

01:27:24.850 --> 01:27:28.923
- What do you want?
- I want you to live.

01:27:29.130 --> 01:27:30.927
I want me to live.

01:27:31.090 --> 01:27:36.642
I want it all to start again, you know,
the battle between good and evil.

01:27:37.330 --> 01:27:41.448
Can't you see I've been getting you
back to where you need to be?

01:27:41.970 --> 01:27:43.562
I'm not interested.

01:27:43.730 --> 01:27:47.564
Bullshit. That day in the car,
what did you say you felt?

01:27:47.730 --> 01:27:49.322
What was the word?

01:27:49.490 --> 01:27:53.802
You felt "connected." Shit.
I almost came when you said that.

01:27:54.410 --> 01:27:57.322
Because thas us, Terry.
Thas you and me.

01:27:57.490 --> 01:27:59.924
Is us. We were meant to be.

01:28:00.250 --> 01:28:03.925
We're Cain and Abel.
Kennedy and Oswald.

01:28:04.090 --> 01:28:07.765
We are shit in the bottom
of somebody's shoe.

01:28:14.330 --> 01:28:16.798
I have to leave now.

01:28:17.210 --> 01:28:19.883
And you're not gonna follow me.

01:28:20.170 --> 01:28:23.128
You're not gonna scrape me off.

01:28:26.170 --> 01:28:31.608
You'll sit by that pay phone and wait
for me to call you from time to time...

01:28:31.770 --> 01:28:36.798
...and when I'm relocated and ready,
I'll let Graciella and Raymond go.

01:28:36.970 --> 01:28:41.168
Then you and me, we can start again.

01:28:43.370 --> 01:28:48.000
I hope you think of me
as often as I think of you.

01:28:52.650 --> 01:28:54.641
BUDDY:
Ah!

01:28:58.890 --> 01:29:00.039
God. Crazy!

01:29:00.570 --> 01:29:02.959
Call an ambulance!

01:29:04.850 --> 01:29:07.523
You're gonna take me to them.

01:29:11.730 --> 01:29:17.043
Keep that tight. That will pinch the
artery, and you won't bleed to death.

01:29:17.810 --> 01:29:22.008
- Now, show me.
- Okay.

01:29:36.330 --> 01:29:39.288
Whas it like having a chick's heart?

01:29:40.530 --> 01:29:42.407
You start watching soaps?

01:29:43.730 --> 01:29:46.563
Get cranky at the end of the month?

01:29:47.770 --> 01:29:51.399
Hear some love song on the radio,
you start crying?

01:29:51.570 --> 01:29:55.404
Plus is a spic heart.
She was a wetback.

01:29:55.570 --> 01:30:00.360
<i>You wake up going, "Arriba! Gotta get
me some enchiladas for the cholita."</i>

01:30:00.530 --> 01:30:02.441
Shut up!

01:30:03.810 --> 01:30:07.007
When they were girls going
to Sunday school...

01:30:07.170 --> 01:30:10.401
...do you think Gloria Torres
ever thought that her heart...

01:30:10.570 --> 01:30:16.361
...would be pumping blood through some
guy that was banging her sister?

01:30:23.090 --> 01:30:25.524
You don't look so good, Ter.

01:30:26.770 --> 01:30:29.967
You don't look so good
yourself there, Buddy.

01:30:44.690 --> 01:30:47.887
Ran aground in that storm
last year. Remember?

01:30:48.050 --> 01:30:51.599
Salvage company's gonna demo
it next week.

01:30:51.770 --> 01:30:54.728
Till then, is a perfect prison.

01:30:54.930 --> 01:30:56.682
Better than Alcatraz.

01:30:56.850 --> 01:30:59.569
My little shop of horrors.

01:31:00.770 --> 01:31:03.079
Just so you know...

01:31:03.810 --> 01:31:06.961
...I would never hurt that little boy.

01:31:07.130 --> 01:31:11.248
See, he's the same blood type.
He's the backup.

01:31:11.490 --> 01:31:14.641
In case anything happens
to his mom's heart.

01:31:37.330 --> 01:31:38.763
MCCALEB:
Come on.

01:31:38.930 --> 01:31:42.479
Do you think you have a chance?
With Graciella?

01:31:42.650 --> 01:31:44.402
You think she can love you?

01:31:44.570 --> 01:31:48.768
After her sister died for you?
Thas tough for her to get around.

01:31:48.930 --> 01:31:52.127
Les go. Les get going.

01:31:56.410 --> 01:31:59.163
You can put the belt in your teeth.

01:32:07.250 --> 01:32:09.161
Follow me.

01:33:01.490 --> 01:33:03.481
In there.

01:33:09.170 --> 01:33:12.367
- The key.
- Ah.

01:33:49.650 --> 01:33:51.880
GRACIELLA: Hey.
- Hey.

01:33:52.050 --> 01:33:53.961
Come on.

01:33:54.290 --> 01:33:56.360
- I knew you'd find us, Terry.
MCCALEB: Yeah, well.

01:33:56.730 --> 01:34:01.326
He may be on the boat, but I'm not
sure if he's dead or alive. Les go.

01:35:07.290 --> 01:35:09.485
Did your father teach
you to run a boat?

01:35:09.650 --> 01:35:12.801
- Yeah.
- My boas at the end of this gangway.

01:35:12.970 --> 01:35:16.280
Wait a few minutes,
then go on down there.

01:35:16.450 --> 01:35:18.918
Use this knife to cut the lines.

01:35:19.090 --> 01:35:23.003
Back off about 100 yards or more
and wait till I call you.

01:35:23.330 --> 01:35:25.048
- All right?
- Yeah.

01:35:25.330 --> 01:35:29.323
If I don't call you in a half-hour,
get the hell out of here.

01:35:30.610 --> 01:35:33.044
Okay. Get going.

01:35:33.490 --> 01:35:36.368
GRACIELLA:
Les go. Come on, honey.

01:35:41.210 --> 01:35:44.247
BUDDY:
I'm sad, Terry!

01:36:45.410 --> 01:36:48.288
GRACIELLA:
Get inside. Hurry up.

01:38:03.690 --> 01:38:05.760
Get down below, Raymond!

01:38:42.650 --> 01:38:46.438
Come on, man.

01:38:46.770 --> 01:38:48.249
We're connected.

01:38:48.770 --> 01:38:51.204
Think of what you're doing.

01:38:51.890 --> 01:38:53.608
You need me.

01:38:54.610 --> 01:38:56.680
No, Buddy.

01:38:56.850 --> 01:39:01.446
Remember how you said I was your
friend and I could tell you the truth?

01:39:02.530 --> 01:39:05.567
Well, I don't need you at all.

01:39:19.010 --> 01:39:21.046
Ten ring.

01:39:27.970 --> 01:39:30.643
I saved you.

01:39:48.410 --> 01:39:51.083
- Right next to you the whole time.
- Yeah.

01:39:51.250 --> 01:39:52.524
You okay?

01:39:52.690 --> 01:39:56.285
Yeah, I'm okay.
Never felt better.

01:39:56.450 --> 01:39:58.805
You got his ass.

01:39:58.970 --> 01:40:01.643
Yeah, there's "no one" anymore.

01:40:01.850 --> 01:40:06.128
Give me a day to catch my breath,
I'll write you a full report.

01:40:06.290 --> 01:40:08.360
I want to see it.

01:40:08.530 --> 01:40:09.883
Two of them okay?

01:40:10.050 --> 01:40:12.359
Yeah, if everyone will
leave them alone...

01:40:12.530 --> 01:40:14.919
...not get them any more involved.

01:40:15.090 --> 01:40:18.605
- I'll see what I can do about that.
- Thas a pal.

01:40:18.770 --> 01:40:21.807
How are you planning
to deal with all this?

01:40:25.170 --> 01:40:27.730
Well, I've got Gloria Torres' heart.

01:40:27.890 --> 01:40:30.279
I'll probably just let that guide me.

01:40:31.170 --> 01:40:34.321
- You got anyone, Jaye?
- Excuse me?

01:40:35.570 --> 01:40:38.209
Police work can get
kind of heavy on you.

01:40:38.370 --> 01:40:40.838
You got anyone at home?

01:40:45.970 --> 01:40:49.485
Yeah, I got someone.

01:40:50.210 --> 01:40:51.723
Good.

01:40:51.890 --> 01:40:53.164
ARRANGO:
McCaleb!

01:40:53.330 --> 01:40:57.164
Thas it! I'm sick and tired of your
grandstanding bullshit!

01:40:57.330 --> 01:40:58.729
WINSTON:
You're out of your jurisdiction.

01:40:58.890 --> 01:41:05.125
Maybe. But because you got a Mexican's
heart, it don't make you one of us!

01:41:06.130 --> 01:41:08.007
Arrango?

01:41:08.410 --> 01:41:13.006
Next time you come around this dock,
this Mexican will kick your ass.

01:41:13.170 --> 01:41:16.845
What? You're out of your
goddamn mind!

01:41:19.410 --> 01:41:21.799
ARRANGO:
All my life, I've had the shitty jobs.

01:41:21.970 --> 01:41:24.484
You got him talking to himself.

01:41:25.730 --> 01:41:28.369
I didn't even know he spoke Spanish.

01:41:34.650 --> 01:41:38.086
Poor baby, he's been
at this all morning.

01:41:41.650 --> 01:41:45.802
I wish I could get a big, fat marlin
and put it on his line.
