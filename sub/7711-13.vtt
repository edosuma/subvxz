00:01.802 --> 00:03.171
(Dwight)
I have left Dunder-Mifflin

00:03.204 --> 00:05.473
after many
record-breaking years,

00:05.506 --> 00:08.209
and I am officially
on the job market.

00:08.242 --> 00:09.443
And it's very exciting.

00:09.477 --> 00:10.611
(Dwight)
For your convenience,

00:10.644 --> 00:12.046
I've broken it down
into three parts:

00:12.080 --> 00:13.747
professional résumé,

00:13.781 --> 00:16.317
athletic
and special skills résumé,

00:16.350 --> 00:18.486
and Dwight Schrute trivia.

00:18.519 --> 00:20.621
I am ready
to face any challenges

00:20.654 --> 00:22.556
that might be foolish enough
to face me.

00:22.590 --> 00:23.791
How would I describe myself?

00:23.824 --> 00:25.226
Three words:

00:25.259 --> 00:26.360
Hardworking,

00:26.394 --> 00:28.196
alpha male,

00:28.229 --> 00:30.431
jackhammer.

00:30.464 --> 00:31.499
Merciless.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.201
Insatiable.

00:33.234 --> 00:35.736
There's nothing on my horizon
except everything.

00:35.769 --> 00:38.172
Everything is on my horizon.

00:38.206 --> 00:39.740
I got this job
to make some money

00:39.773 --> 00:42.376
while I continue
my employment search.

00:42.410 --> 00:43.644
And, uh...

00:43.677 --> 00:45.379
it's fine
for the time being.

00:45.413 --> 00:46.514
Oops.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.082
Break's over.

00:56.557 --> 00:57.591
Big Turkey.

00:58.892 --> 01:00.394

and a-singing this song *

01:09.503 --> 01:10.671
* All the little birds

01:10.704 --> 01:11.572
Is that you singing?

01:11.605 --> 01:12.573
All four parts.

01:12.606 --> 01:14.175
Recorded it
on my computer.

01:14.208 --> 01:15.576
It took me forever.

01:15.609 --> 01:17.478
* Tweet-tweet,

Nice job.

01:17.511 --> 01:19.313
Thank you muchly.
* Tweet-tweet tweet

01:19.347 --> 01:20.648
* Go rockin' robin

01:20.681 --> 01:22.483
* Boy, you're really
gonna rock tonight *

01:22.516 --> 01:23.717

01:23.751 --> 01:25.353

01:26.620 --> 01:28.556

[chuckles]

01:28.589 --> 01:29.723
I called it myself.

01:29.757 --> 01:31.425
I just thought
you'd get a kick

01:31.459 --> 01:32.426
out of the new ring.

01:32.460 --> 01:33.427
[song stops]
Yikes.

01:33.461 --> 01:34.595
Side note:

01:34.628 --> 01:35.463
I'd just like
to say I'm thrilled

01:35.496 --> 01:36.497
to be working
directly beneath you.

01:36.530 --> 01:39.367
Oh.
I feel I have a lot
to learn from you.

01:39.400 --> 01:42.303
Even though you're younger
and have less experience.

01:42.336 --> 01:44.538
So...

01:44.572 --> 01:46.374
here's to the future.

01:46.407 --> 01:48.342
Andy and The Tuna.

01:48.376 --> 01:49.710
[To Bennie and the Jets]
* Yeh ah-ah

01:49.743 --> 01:51.245
* Andy and The Tuna

01:51.279 --> 01:52.713
[tapping on desk]

01:52.746 --> 01:53.581
* Oh

01:53.614 --> 01:56.517
[scatting]

01:56.550 --> 01:58.652
* Ah-ah
Andy and The Tuna *

02:00.488 --> 02:01.889
I miss Dwight.

02:03.957 --> 02:06.460
Congratulations, Universe.

02:06.494 --> 02:08.429
You win.

02:08.462 --> 02:11.432
[cheerful music]

02:11.465 --> 02:19.473
*

02:28.982 --> 02:31.519
Yes, Dwight Schrute
has left the company--

02:31.552 --> 02:33.221
more personnel turnover.

02:33.254 --> 02:34.655
Cost of doin' business.

02:34.688 --> 02:36.924
Yeah, well,
it is a big loss.

02:36.957 --> 02:39.360
Dwight was
the top salesman.

02:39.393 --> 02:40.628
Was the top salesman.

02:40.661 --> 02:41.795
I said "was."

02:41.829 --> 02:44.665
[chuckles]
Addition by subtraction.

02:44.698 --> 02:46.467
What does that even mean?

02:46.500 --> 02:47.835
That is impossible.

02:47.868 --> 02:48.969
Mmm...

02:49.002 --> 02:50.804
Yeah, you're right.

02:50.838 --> 02:53.241
But there is some good news.
Oscar is back.

02:53.274 --> 02:55.776
Addition by addition.

02:55.809 --> 02:58.512
So we are going
to have a big party today

02:58.546 --> 03:00.881
to welcome him back,
and hopefully

03:00.914 --> 03:02.816
that'll lift
everyone's spirits.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.852
Hey, everyone.

03:04.885 --> 03:05.886
Oh, hello, Oscar.

03:05.919 --> 03:07.688
How was your gay-cation?

03:07.721 --> 03:09.823
That's very funny.

03:09.857 --> 03:10.824
Yeah?

03:10.858 --> 03:11.825
I thought of that,
like,

03:11.859 --> 03:13.727
two seconds
after you left.

03:13.761 --> 03:14.762
All right.

03:18.932 --> 03:20.834
Hi, Angela.

03:20.868 --> 03:23.604
Oscar.

03:23.637 --> 03:24.605
[door opens]

03:24.638 --> 03:25.673
Hey, boss.

03:25.706 --> 03:26.807
Hey, what's up?

03:26.840 --> 03:28.309
Nooothin'.

03:29.777 --> 03:31.979
Enhrrr...hehh.

03:32.012 --> 03:35.916
[chuckles]
Man, TGI Wednesday.

03:35.949 --> 03:37.518
Yeah.
Am I right?

03:37.551 --> 03:38.619
Yep.

03:38.652 --> 03:40.854
Gonna go home,
get my beer on,

03:40.888 --> 03:43.524
get my Lost on.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.426
What are you doin' later?
You want to hang out?

03:45.459 --> 03:47.595
Uh...I don't know.

03:47.628 --> 03:48.696
Maybe.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.731
Well, I'll take that
as a "maybe."

03:57.871 --> 03:59.740
Where you goin'?
Bathroom.

03:59.773 --> 04:01.008
Well, I'm going
to the kitchen.

04:01.041 --> 04:02.510
I'll walk with you.

04:08.516 --> 04:10.718
Yeah, things
are goin' pretty good.

04:10.751 --> 04:13.487
Gettin' a lot of face time
with the boss.

04:13.521 --> 04:15.723
[typing]

04:15.756 --> 04:17.425
[adding machine clatters]

04:17.458 --> 04:18.559
Oscar?

04:19.727 --> 04:20.794
I have a question.

04:22.463 --> 04:24.665
Would you like to join
the Party Planning Committee?

04:24.698 --> 04:25.966
The committee
with all the women?

04:25.999 --> 04:27.000
Yeah.

04:27.034 --> 04:28.369
Because I'm gay?

04:28.402 --> 04:29.803
[Kevin snickers]
No.

04:29.837 --> 04:31.605
No.

04:31.639 --> 04:34.442
Certain events
have transpired,

04:34.475 --> 04:38.078
and I've thought
about certain things.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.613
And I'm sorry for the way

04:39.647 --> 04:42.816
those certain events
transpired.

04:42.850 --> 04:44.852
And I would just like
to make some changes

04:44.885 --> 04:47.655
about certain things

04:47.688 --> 04:49.523
and certain situations.

04:49.557 --> 04:50.591
Okay, okay.
And certain accountants.

04:50.624 --> 04:51.592
All right, all right,
I'll join.

04:51.625 --> 04:52.593
I'd love to.

04:52.626 --> 04:53.627
That's--

04:53.661 --> 04:54.828
Thank you.

04:54.862 --> 04:55.829
Thank you.

04:55.863 --> 04:56.764
Thank you.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.732
[sniffling]

04:58.766 --> 05:01.502
Can I join too?

05:03.671 --> 05:04.938
Never.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.107
You sell those two printers
this morning?

05:07.140 --> 05:08.576
Nice work.

05:08.609 --> 05:09.677
[scoffing]
Child's play.

05:09.710 --> 05:12.079
Give me something hard
to sell.

05:13.614 --> 05:14.615
Wow.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.083
What is wrong
with this thing?

05:16.116 --> 05:17.651
It looks terrible.

05:17.685 --> 05:18.852
Do you want me to ask
the night cleaning crew

05:18.886 --> 05:19.853
if they stopped
watering it?

05:19.887 --> 05:20.854
Yeah.

05:20.888 --> 05:22.356
Oh, you know what?

05:22.390 --> 05:24.358
Ask them about the toys
on my desk too.

05:24.392 --> 05:26.894
They always used
to arrange the toys on my desk

05:26.927 --> 05:29.129
in a--a very pleasing way.

05:29.162 --> 05:30.698
It used to brighten my morning.

05:30.731 --> 05:32.132
Oh, that wasn't
the night crew.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.401
That was Dwight.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.804
Really?

05:36.837 --> 05:38.972
That was very nice of him.

05:39.006 --> 05:42.142
We need more attitude like that
around this office.

05:42.175 --> 05:43.844
Feel ya, dawg.

05:43.877 --> 05:45.078
Yeah, do you?

05:45.112 --> 05:46.947
Absolutely.

05:46.980 --> 05:48.649
What did I say?

05:49.917 --> 05:51.485
You said...

05:51.519 --> 05:53.521
Ruh-duht duh duh-dooh.
[chuckles]

05:53.554 --> 05:54.588
Huh.

05:54.622 --> 05:55.589
Which is, like,

05:55.623 --> 05:56.757
"Right on."

05:56.790 --> 05:58.125
Pam was like,
"Blah blah blah."

05:58.158 --> 06:01.829
And you were like,
"Yeah. Psh-sht."

06:01.862 --> 06:03.864
Nailed it.

06:08.902 --> 06:10.404
Oh.

06:10.438 --> 06:11.972
Oh, no.

06:12.005 --> 06:14.007
Love that Andy, right?

06:14.041 --> 06:15.809
Solid fellow?

06:15.843 --> 06:16.877
Seems smart enough.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.946
Likes me a lot.

06:18.979 --> 06:20.080
A lot.

06:20.113 --> 06:21.915
Too much.

06:21.949 --> 06:24.985
Like a crazy person,
a little.

06:25.018 --> 06:28.789
Not super crazy, just...

06:28.822 --> 06:30.991
there's something about him
that creeps me out.

06:31.024 --> 06:33.427
I can't really explain it.

06:33.461 --> 06:35.663
He's always up
in my bidness,

06:35.696 --> 06:38.999
which is Ebonics
for "being in my face

06:39.032 --> 06:41.569
and annoying
the bejesus out of me."

06:41.602 --> 06:44.204
I don't understand how someone

06:44.237 --> 06:46.907
could have
so little self-awareness.

06:53.046 --> 06:55.048
I really have no preference.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.584
We don't even have
to have a party.

06:56.617 --> 06:58.118
No. Hey, hey...

06:58.151 --> 06:58.986
Don't be ridiculous.

06:59.019 --> 07:01.755
Of course we are going
to have a party,

07:01.789 --> 07:03.691
a celebration of Oscar.

07:03.724 --> 07:04.892
Oscar night.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.994
And I want it
to be Oscar-specific.

07:07.027 --> 07:07.861
(Oscar)
Michael, I--
No, no.

07:07.895 --> 07:09.997
I mean, not--
not because you're gay.

07:10.030 --> 07:11.031
Your gayness

07:11.064 --> 07:12.533
does not define you.

07:12.566 --> 07:13.534
Okay.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.903
Your Mexican-ness
is what defines you to me.

07:15.936 --> 07:19.707
And I think we should celebrate
Oscar's Mexicanity.

07:19.740 --> 07:21.241
So...Phyllis,

07:21.274 --> 07:25.045
I want you
to go find firecrackers...

07:25.078 --> 07:26.680
and a Chihuahua.

07:26.714 --> 07:29.950
Pam,
in the frozen food section,

07:29.983 --> 07:31.852
Swanson makes
a delightful chimichanga.

07:31.885 --> 07:33.687
(Oscar)
Why don't you have me
riding in on a donkey

07:33.721 --> 07:35.856
into the office,
like Pepe?

07:35.889 --> 07:37.157
Ah...a burro.
Of course.

07:37.190 --> 07:40.127
If Oscar wants a donkey,
let's get him one.

07:42.996 --> 07:44.097
Need any help?

07:44.131 --> 07:46.800
Oh, no thank you.

07:46.834 --> 07:48.769
I'm--I'm just looking.

07:48.802 --> 07:49.837
Great.

07:53.774 --> 07:56.043
I will literally
be standing right here

07:56.076 --> 07:58.512
if you need anything
at all.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.050
Okay.

08:05.318 --> 08:08.522
I think I could go for some
tuna fish right about now.

08:08.556 --> 08:11.158
Oh, oh, oh,
got my rod here.

08:11.191 --> 08:13.594
Whizzzzzz...

08:13.627 --> 08:14.662
Bloop.

08:16.229 --> 08:17.531
Click, click.

08:17.565 --> 08:19.032
Click, click, click.

08:19.066 --> 08:20.634
Click, click.

08:20.668 --> 08:21.869
Click, click,
click, click.

08:21.902 --> 08:23.103
Click, click,
click, click.

08:23.136 --> 08:24.137
Click, click,
click--Argh!

08:24.171 --> 08:25.238
Oop! Oh.

08:25.272 --> 08:27.140
I got one.
I got one.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.008
Eeh!

08:30.644 --> 08:31.612
Hey.

08:31.645 --> 08:33.180
Hey.
Hey.

08:33.213 --> 08:37.184
So, Andy is
in rare form today.

08:37.217 --> 08:39.987
Yeah, you should
not encourage him.

08:40.020 --> 08:41.622
Encourage him?

08:41.655 --> 08:43.691
I'm the victim, okay?

08:43.724 --> 08:45.058
He's fishing for me.

08:45.092 --> 08:46.126
We've got to do something.

08:46.159 --> 08:48.996
Look, I've got,
like, 15 new clients

08:49.029 --> 08:50.163
that I've inherited
from Dwight,

08:50.197 --> 08:52.065
and each file
is password protected

08:52.099 --> 08:53.233
with a different
mythical creature,

08:53.266 --> 08:55.869
so...I'm sorry.

08:55.903 --> 08:58.105
I can't.

08:58.138 --> 08:59.873
Fine.

08:59.907 --> 09:01.208
Party pooper.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.279
Oop! Ooh.
Rah!

09:06.313 --> 09:07.715
Unh!

09:07.748 --> 09:08.749
Ooh!

09:08.782 --> 09:10.350
Ah! Whoa!

09:10.383 --> 09:12.686
(Michael)
Who's that sportscaster
that bit that lady?

09:12.720 --> 09:14.154
Marv something?

09:14.187 --> 09:15.155
Floppin' around!

09:15.188 --> 09:16.123
Andy is like Marv something.

09:16.156 --> 09:18.158
Great sportscaster...

09:18.191 --> 09:20.661
big, weirdo creep.

09:20.694 --> 09:23.063
185 pounder.
Check it out.

09:23.096 --> 09:26.166
Whew!
Ahh!

09:31.104 --> 09:32.139
Hey, Ryan?

09:32.172 --> 09:33.741
What?

09:33.774 --> 09:35.342
Do you wanna pull a prank
on Andy?

09:35.375 --> 09:40.113
Not right now,
but ask me again 10 years ago.

09:42.816 --> 09:44.351
I liked you better
as the temp.

09:44.384 --> 09:46.253
[sighs]
Me too.

09:47.821 --> 09:49.790
Hey, guys.

09:49.823 --> 09:51.224
How's the workload

09:51.258 --> 09:54.061
on all of
Dwight's old accounts?

09:54.094 --> 09:55.128
Handling it okay?

09:55.162 --> 09:57.831
Sort of.
He had a lot of clients.

09:57.865 --> 09:59.700
Yes, he did.

09:59.733 --> 10:01.168
Have any of you

10:01.201 --> 10:02.736
talked to Dwight?

10:02.770 --> 10:03.804
Oh, sure.

10:03.837 --> 10:05.105
We talk all the time.

10:05.138 --> 10:07.040
Really?
No.

10:07.074 --> 10:08.241
Don't--don't do that.

10:08.275 --> 10:09.643
That's not nice.

10:09.677 --> 10:11.144
What about you, Phyllis?

10:11.178 --> 10:12.913
You and Dwight
were close.

10:12.946 --> 10:15.248
No. Sorry.

10:15.282 --> 10:16.383
Dwight had
a big personality,

10:16.416 --> 10:18.686
and I have
a big personality.

10:18.719 --> 10:19.953
And a lot of times

10:19.987 --> 10:21.789
when two people like that
get together,

10:21.822 --> 10:23.824
it can be explosive.

10:23.857 --> 10:26.293
Really comin' down
out there.

10:26.326 --> 10:28.361
Commute's gonna be hell.

10:28.395 --> 10:30.898
I have snow tires
and chains.

10:30.931 --> 10:34.034
Plus exceptional
eye-hand coordination.

10:35.869 --> 10:39.006
So, um, where were you
workin' before this?

10:39.039 --> 10:40.708

10:40.741 --> 10:42.710
What kind of company
is that?

10:42.743 --> 10:43.977
[scoffs]

10:44.011 --> 10:45.846
Paper company.

10:45.879 --> 10:48.448
They're only one of Staples'
top competitors in the area.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.150

10:50.183 --> 10:52.319
I never heard of 'em.
Whoa.

10:52.352 --> 10:54.788
Really?
Have you heard of paper?

10:56.189 --> 10:57.991
It's gonna be like that, huh?

10:58.025 --> 11:00.861
I don't like him,
his giant head,

11:00.894 --> 11:02.830
or his beady little eyes.

11:02.863 --> 11:04.898

on the matter.

of--Yes, please.

11:28.255 --> 11:29.189

Nice one.

11:44.004 --> 11:45.806
Are there any messages?

11:45.839 --> 11:46.907
Nope.

11:46.940 --> 11:47.908
So weird.

11:47.941 --> 11:49.142
Hmm.

was late that morning

14:07.514 --> 14:08.715
because he had
to drive to New York

would have driven

No.

I don't want to do
any of that.

Duh.

Which is why
I was joking about doing it.

No, just stop. Stop.

Just stop doing it.

for her?

19:37.510 --> 19:38.511
Yes.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.520
* La cucaracha

19:47.554 --> 19:48.621
* La cucaracha

19:48.655 --> 19:53.726
*

19:53.760 --> 19:58.431
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
the big finale.

19:58.465 --> 20:00.700
Sir, would you
do the honor?

20:01.801 --> 20:03.202
Oh, man.

20:04.937 --> 20:06.739
No, no, no.

20:06.773 --> 20:08.375
I don't need it.

20:09.842 --> 20:11.010
Get out!

20:11.043 --> 20:12.645
[shouting indistinctly]

20:14.046 --> 20:16.849
(Michael)
It takes a big man
to admit his mistake,

20:16.883 --> 20:19.452
and that's what I did.

20:19.486 --> 20:21.788
The important thing is...

20:21.821 --> 20:23.856
I learned something.

20:23.890 --> 20:27.394
I don't want somebody
sucking up to me

20:27.427 --> 20:30.029
because they think
I am going to help their career.

20:30.062 --> 20:34.033
I want them
sucking up to me

20:34.066 --> 20:37.704
because
they genuinely love me.

20:37.737 --> 20:39.672
Hmm.
