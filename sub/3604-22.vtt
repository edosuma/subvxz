deserve you.

it's a lie, Alena, a lie.

get away from him, now,

Bennet's old
Primatech files.

32:53.222 --> 32:55.884
Looks like he's been
holding out on you.

33:00.479 --> 33:01.889
I'm not surprised.

33:02.231 --> 33:03.471
No?

33:03.566 --> 33:05.898
Are you surprised now?

33:08.154 --> 33:11.567
If I were Sylar,
I wouldn't need this,
now would I?

33:14.743 --> 33:15.732
Gun.

33:18.414 --> 33:22.908
I knew he couldn't have gotten
to James Martin alone,
not right under your nose.

33:23.627 --> 33:24.833
What do you want?

33:24.920 --> 33:26.330
How dumb are you?

33:26.589 --> 33:29.001
How did you think
it was gonna end?

33:29.091 --> 33:34.631
Who did you think would be
left standing the minute
Sylar got bored? You?

33:34.763 --> 33:38.426
What do you want?
I want Sylar on a platter.

33:39.560 --> 33:43.394
And then, maybe,
I'll overlook this
pathetic little cry for help.

33:46.108 --> 33:51.853
He's been going on
assignment as Agent Donner,
leader of Team 6.

33:52.990 --> 33:55.606
They've been racking up
a lot of wins lately.

33:57.119 --> 33:58.529
Where are they now?

33:58.662 --> 34:00.072
On a mission.

34:00.998 --> 34:02.784
They should be
back in an hour.

34:04.752 --> 34:06.083
I'll wait.

34:09.798 --> 34:11.413
And so will you.

34:12.176 --> 34:15.418
I know you meant well,
Hiro, but I didn't ask
to be rescued.

34:15.512 --> 34:18.128
Dr. Suresh told us
about your plan.

34:18.265 --> 34:19.971
It is one thing
to defend yourself,

34:20.059 --> 34:22.892
but a true warrior
knows the difference
between a righteous battle...

34:22.978 --> 34:24.229
And what? Retribution?

34:24.313 --> 34:25.302
See, that's where
you're wrong.

34:25.397 --> 34:27.228
It's the only thing
the other side understands.

34:27.316 --> 34:28.726
But that is why we
are better than them.

34:28.817 --> 34:30.648
That is why we
had to save you.

34:31.195 --> 34:33.982
Matt! Finally.

34:38.410 --> 34:39.570
What's going on?

34:39.662 --> 34:41.573
I cannot make
the face anymore.

34:41.664 --> 34:43.655
What's With the kid?

34:43.749 --> 34:47.867
Matt Parkman,
meet Matt Parkman.

34:50.381 --> 34:51.666
He is your son.

34:56.011 --> 34:58.093
Wait. My son?

34:58.180 --> 35:01.138
We rescued him
from government agents
in California.

35:01.225 --> 35:03.056
He has a power
like us.

35:03.852 --> 35:06.184
This is why
you can't give up.

35:06.730 --> 35:08.641
A boy needs his father.

35:12.528 --> 35:14.189
I have a son?

35:17.741 --> 35:18.730
Hi.

35:20.286 --> 35:21.742
I have a son.

35:23.872 --> 35:24.827
Hey.

35:24.915 --> 35:25.904
(CHUCKLES)

35:27.960 --> 35:30.417
Outstanding.
Great work out there.

35:30.504 --> 35:33.291
Wade, good job.
Sir.

35:33.382 --> 35:34.371
Agent Donner.

35:34.466 --> 35:35.455
Yes, sir.

35:35.551 --> 35:36.836
A word, please.

35:36.927 --> 35:38.588
Did I do something wrong?

35:38.679 --> 35:42.547
Just wanted to say congrats.
You guys have really
been on a roll lately.

35:43.142 --> 35:44.678
Thank you, sir.

35:44.768 --> 35:47.384
This man is not Donner,
he's Sylar.

35:47.479 --> 35:48.980
He has
shape-shifting
abilities.

35:49.064 --> 35:50.315
Get a lock on
the back of his head.

35:50.399 --> 35:53.436
Whoa, whoa, guys,
it's just me.

35:54.069 --> 35:55.684
Tell him, Danko.

35:55.779 --> 35:58.111
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

36:01.285 --> 36:03.867
Agent Danko
has betrayed you.

36:03.996 --> 36:06.533
He and Sylar are
working against you.

36:06.623 --> 36:08.534
Guys, this is
a huge mistake.

36:08.625 --> 36:09.660
Put the gun down, Bennet.

36:09.752 --> 36:10.912
This is Sylar.

36:11.003 --> 36:14.166
He's killed a dozen agents,
and Danko is protecting him.

36:14.256 --> 36:15.496
Everybody stand down.

36:17.259 --> 36:19.500
Yeah, because of
the divorce
and everything.

36:20.929 --> 36:23.136
How would you know
a thing like that?

36:30.773 --> 36:33.230
Everybody, freeze!

36:33.317 --> 36:37.105
This is Sylar,
and I can prove it.
He's gonna heal, you watch.

36:42.826 --> 36:46.193
Get up. Get up.

36:47.790 --> 36:50.122
Get up. Get up!

36:56.382 --> 36:57.713
He's dead.

37:00.469 --> 37:02.801
Sylar was never
even in the building.

37:04.139 --> 37:05.970
You just killed
an innocent man.

37:06.058 --> 37:10.017
Nobody moves.
Put your weapons on
the ground, right now.

37:10.145 --> 37:12.978
Weapons down,
or I will blow
his head off!

37:15.818 --> 37:17.228
Get him!

37:36.088 --> 37:38.249
I didn't have
a lot of options.

37:38.549 --> 37:40.756
I had to direct
him somewhere.

37:41.260 --> 37:44.923
It seemed the safest choice.

37:52.271 --> 37:53.511
(GRUNTS)

38:13.584 --> 38:17.202
You almost got me killed.
You could have said
I was Agent Foster.

38:18.464 --> 38:21.501
Except if Bennet shot Foster,
Foster would be dead.

38:24.094 --> 38:26.710
Didn't know you
could bleed like that.

38:28.182 --> 38:32.801
Isqueezed
a little extra for show.

38:35.105 --> 38:38.563
Sandra,
I just called to say...

38:39.359 --> 38:42.522
I don't know what.
I love you, miss you.

38:42.905 --> 38:44.691
I miss my family.

38:46.366 --> 38:48.231
All my old
numbers are burned.

38:48.368 --> 38:50.233
I can't leave you
this one.

38:51.371 --> 38:53.327
I'll call you again
when it's safe.

39:09.765 --> 39:11.721
(SPEAKING BABY TALK)

39:20.359 --> 39:21.849
Alena, it's me.

39:23.737 --> 39:27.605
I know how you must feel.
Betrayed. Angry.

39:27.699 --> 39:31.442
But what / said before,
it’s not true.

39:31.537 --> 39:33.448
You mean so much to me.

39:33.580 --> 39:35.491
The way / am with you...

39:37.334 --> 39:38.915
It's not a lie.

39:40.337 --> 39:44.751
Jakob Prodasa is...
Is the man I want to be.

39:45.592 --> 39:47.969
/ can’t do it without you.

39:49.179 --> 39:52.467
I’m begging you. Please.

39:54.810 --> 39:56.596
Give me a chance
to prove myself.

40:06.071 --> 40:09.063
You know, I still don't
understand what we're
doing out here, Mom.

40:09.157 --> 40:11.068
This is the place,
Peter.

40:13.120 --> 40:15.827
This is where
our story really begins.

40:16.498 --> 40:17.533
Yeah.

40:23.922 --> 40:25.207
Why did you call him here?

40:25.299 --> 40:26.505
This family has
to come together.

40:26.592 --> 40:28.833
Whatever has happened,
Nathan is still
your brother.

40:28.927 --> 40:30.258
Yeah, well,
I have a hard time
believing that.

40:30.345 --> 40:31.334
Peter.

40:31.430 --> 40:32.840
Claire, it's all right.
Let him vent.

40:33.307 --> 40:37.300
Enough.
There's been too much
misery in this place.

40:38.061 --> 40:41.178
What happened here, Ma?
Why'd you call us together?

40:41.273 --> 40:45.141
I never wanted you
to see this. Any of you.

40:45.611 --> 40:48.227
But I realize now
that was a mistake,

40:48.322 --> 40:50.483
and to prepare
for the future,

40:50.616 --> 40:52.823
you have to understand
the past.

40:54.828 --> 40:57.035
You want the answers?

40:58.081 --> 40:59.537
Then you'll have to dig.

41:02.836 --> 41:05.828
MOH/NDER: It is our nature
to protect our children,

41:05.922 --> 41:10.256
for each generation to
pass on their cautionary tales
to the next.

41:10.761 --> 41:13.002
So it is with
the myth of Icarus.

41:13.096 --> 41:16.839
The legend ofa boy
who fashioned wings
from feathers and wax,

41:16.933 --> 41:19.219
daring to fly
into the heavens.

41:21.396 --> 41:24.684
His father was fearful,
and warned
Icarus to be careful.

41:24.816 --> 41:25.931
PETER: You find something?

41:26.026 --> 41:30.110
Begging him not to tempt fate
by flying too close
to the sun.

41:30.530 --> 41:34.239
But in the end,
the boy couldn’t resist.

41:34.326 --> 41:37.193
His waxen wings
melted from the sun ’3 rays.

41:42.626 --> 41:44.491
You know who that was?

41:44.586 --> 41:48.170
I knew all of them.

41:48.715 --> 41:50.000
All of them?

41:52.678 --> 41:56.045
Exactly how
many are here, Ma?

41:57.265 --> 41:58.641
Keep digging.
