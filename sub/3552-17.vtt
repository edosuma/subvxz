WEBVTT

00:01.172 --> 00:02.173
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.173 --> 00:04.435
CARLOS NEEDED TO MAKE A CHANGE.

00:04.435 --> 00:08.309
I AM MISERABLE AT WORK.
I CAN'T DO IT ANYMORE.

00:08.309 --> 00:11.042
ORSON SENT THE POLICE
AN ANONYMOUS TIP.

00:11.042 --> 00:13.013
GOT A FEELING ABOUT THIS.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.785
ENOUGH OF A FEELING TO GO
DIG UP A CONSTRUCTION SITE?

00:16.387 --> 00:18.018
MIKE PROTECTED RENEE...

00:18.018 --> 00:19.650
HE IS A GOOD MAN.

00:19.650 --> 00:22.153
BUT HE PAID THE PRICE.

00:29.460 --> 00:31.762
(Mary Alice)
EVERY DAY ON WISTERIA LANE,

00:31.762 --> 00:35.366
WOMEN FACE THEIR SHARE
OF PROBLEMS...

00:35.366 --> 00:40.171
LIKE A PAPERBOY
WHO'S OFF THE MARK...

00:40.171 --> 00:43.574
(beeping)
 AN APPLIANCE
THAT'S OUT OF WHACK...

00:45.246 --> 00:50.181
OR A REPORT CARD
THAT'S BELOW PAR.

00:50.181 --> 00:53.124
THESE EVERYDAY PROBLEMS
CAN SEEM LIKE

00:53.124 --> 00:55.586
MATTERS OF LIFE AND DEATH.

00:55.586 --> 00:58.489
I'VE TOLD YOUR PAPERBOY
TEN TIMES--

00:58.489 --> 01:01.592
THE FLOWER BED SPRINKLERS GO ON
AT 6:00 A.M. SHARP.

01:01.592 --> 01:04.295
(gunshot, tires peal)

01:04.295 --> 01:05.566
(beep, phone clatters)

01:05.566 --> 01:07.198
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN
CALL HIM A REPAIRMAN

01:07.198 --> 01:09.240
IF AFTER HE VISITS,
THE THING IS NOT REPAIRED.

01:09.240 --> 01:10.571
(gunshot, tires peal)

01:10.571 --> 01:11.742
(beep)

01:11.742 --> 01:14.245
AND GET THIS, CARLOS.
HER MATH TEACHER WROTE,

01:14.245 --> 01:17.178
"THE ONLY THING WORSE THAN
HER ARITHMETIC IS HER ATTITUDE."

01:17.178 --> 01:19.150
(gunshot, tires peal)

01:19.150 --> 01:21.452
(beep)

01:21.452 --> 01:25.456
BUT THEN SOMETHING
TRULY HORRIBLE COMES ALONG...

01:27.618 --> 01:32.092
AND WE RUSH TO HOLD ON
TO WHAT REALLY MATTERS...

01:32.092 --> 01:33.164
(exhales deeply)

01:33.164 --> 01:34.865
(Susan crying)

01:34.865 --> 01:36.167
MIKE!

01:36.167 --> 01:39.330
BEFORE IT'S GONE FOREVER.

01:55.146 --> 01:57.318
WHEN A LOVED ONE DIES,

01:57.318 --> 02:01.492
CERTAIN DECISIONS
HAVE TO BE MADE.

02:03.123 --> 02:06.257
A COFFIN MUST BE SELECTED.

02:09.259 --> 02:12.233
A HEADSTONE MUST BE PICKED.

02:15.306 --> 02:19.170
CLOTHES MUST BE CHOSEN.

02:19.170 --> 02:21.812
PREPARING A BODY FOR BURIAL

02:21.812 --> 02:24.645
IS NEVER AN EASY THING
TO DO...

02:24.645 --> 02:26.247
(police radio chatter)

02:26.247 --> 02:31.151
BUT UNEARTHING ONE
CAN BE EVEN HARDER.

02:31.151 --> 02:33.324
(police radio chatter)

02:33.324 --> 02:36.827
HEY! I THINK WE GOT SOMETHING.

02:46.237 --> 02:47.438
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

02:48.939 --> 02:51.272
YOU LOOK HANDSOME.

02:51.272 --> 02:52.803
WHAT'S THAT UNDER YOUR SHIRT?

02:52.803 --> 02:56.647
MY LITTLE TRIBUTE TO MIKE.

02:56.647 --> 02:59.550
HE WOULD'VE LOVED THAT.

03:01.352 --> 03:02.753
HE WAS ALWAYS TRYING
TO GET ME

03:02.753 --> 03:05.456
TO GO TO INDIANAPOLIS
FOR A GAME. (chuckles)

03:05.456 --> 03:08.859
AND I WAS TOO BUSY
BEING A BIG EXECUTIVE,

03:08.859 --> 03:12.223
HELPING RICH PEOPLE
GET RICHER.

03:12.223 --> 03:13.724
THAT'LL BE A...

03:13.724 --> 03:16.267
GREAT EULOGY SOMEDAY, HUH?

03:20.231 --> 03:21.972
IS THIS ABOUT YOU WANTING
TO QUIT YOUR JOB AGAIN

03:21.972 --> 03:23.934
SO YOU CAN BE
AN UNDERPAID COUNSELOR?

03:23.934 --> 03:26.677
I'M NEVER GONNA BE ABLE TO GET
YOU TO UNDERSTAND THIS, AM I?

03:26.677 --> 03:28.339
WHAT A DIFFERENCE
IT WOULD MAKE IN MY LIFE

03:28.339 --> 03:30.411
IF I FELT LIKE
I WAS HELPING PEOPLE.

03:30.411 --> 03:32.383
YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M NEVER GONNA
UNDERSTAND IT, AND I ALSO

03:32.383 --> 03:34.315
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE HAVE
TO TALK ABOUT THIS TODAY.

03:34.315 --> 03:36.887
BECAUSE MY BEST FRIEND
IS DEAD,

03:36.887 --> 03:38.319
AND HE DIED TRYING
TO HELP PEOPLE,

03:38.319 --> 03:40.851
SO IF YOU ASK ME,
IT KIND OF SEEMS LIKE

03:40.851 --> 03:43.654
THE PERFECT DAY
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

03:45.896 --> 03:48.559
THIS ONE?

03:48.559 --> 03:50.331
SURE.

03:50.331 --> 03:53.434
UM, SHOES?

03:54.635 --> 03:56.307
YOU PICK.

03:56.307 --> 03:58.809
(doorbell rings)

04:01.842 --> 04:02.943
HI, REVEREND.

04:02.943 --> 04:04.715
HELLO, JULIE.

04:06.277 --> 04:08.279
(door closes)
 SUSAN.

04:10.250 --> 04:12.022
I, UM, WANTED TO SHOW YOU

04:12.022 --> 04:14.985
A... ROUGH DRAFT
OF MIKE'S FUNERAL SERVICE.

04:14.985 --> 04:16.557
IT'S WHAT WE DISCUSSED--

04:16.557 --> 04:18.959
A STANDARD
EPISCOPALIAN CEREMONY.

04:18.959 --> 04:21.992
I'M SURE IT'LL BE FINE.

04:26.567 --> 04:31.302
UM, JUST WANTED TO SEE
IF YOU'D LIKE TO ADD ANYTHING

04:31.302 --> 04:33.344
TO MAKE IT
A LITTLE MORE PERSONAL.

04:33.344 --> 04:35.306
READINGS, FOR EXAMPLE.

04:35.306 --> 04:37.348
DID HE HAVE
ANY FAVORITE POEMS?

04:37.348 --> 04:39.350
ANY FAVORITE WRITERS?

04:40.651 --> 04:45.816
MIKE REALLY WASN'T
MUCH OF A READER.

04:45.816 --> 04:47.518
THAT'S FINE.

04:47.518 --> 04:51.862
WERE YOU PLANNING ON SAYING
SOMETHING DURING THE SERVICE?

04:53.424 --> 04:56.527
LIKE WHAT, "I WISH SOMEONE
HADN'T MURDERED MY HUSBAND"?

04:58.399 --> 04:59.430
MOM...

05:01.402 --> 05:02.973
HE'S JUST TRYING TO HELP.

05:02.973 --> 05:05.776
I KNOW. I'M SORRY.

05:05.776 --> 05:08.038
I JUST, UH...

05:08.038 --> 05:12.743
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD SAY
THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH.

05:12.743 --> 05:17.518
I DON'T KNOW HOW TO TELL PEOPLE
WHAT KIND OF MAN MIKE WAS...

05:19.450 --> 05:23.323
WHAT KIND OF FATHER AND HUSBAND
AND FRIEND HE WAS.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.496
I JUST...

05:25.496 --> 05:27.498
NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD
HAVE TO SUM UP HIS LIFE

05:27.498 --> 05:31.602
BEFORE HE WAS...
DONE LIVING IT.

05:38.609 --> 05:41.472
IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

05:41.472 --> 05:43.974
(scoffs)

05:43.974 --> 05:45.576
PLEASE, REVEREND,

05:45.576 --> 05:48.919
IF THERE'S ONE THING THAT I KNOW
FOR SURE AT THIS MOMENT,

05:48.919 --> 05:51.382
IS THAT...

05:51.382 --> 05:53.784
NOTHING IS EVER
GOING TO BE OKAY AGAIN.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.933
(car door opens and closes)

06:06.937 --> 06:09.039
(car door closes)

06:10.471 --> 06:11.542
HEY.

06:11.542 --> 06:13.143
HEY.

06:14.445 --> 06:16.106
HOW'S SUSAN HOLDING UP?

06:16.106 --> 06:19.480
SHE'LL BE REALLY GLAD
YOU CAME.

06:19.480 --> 06:20.911
I CAUGHT THE FIRST FLIGHT
AFTER YOU CALLED ME.

06:20.911 --> 06:23.083
I'M JUST, UH...

06:23.083 --> 06:24.555
I'M STILL IN SHOCK.

06:24.555 --> 06:27.087
YOU KNOW WHAT I KEEP
THINKING ABOUT ALL MORNING?

06:28.719 --> 06:31.722
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT TIME
YOU, ME, MIKE, AND SUSAN

06:31.722 --> 06:34.394
RENTED THOSE CABINS
BY THE LAKE?

06:34.394 --> 06:35.926
OH, NO. THE PONTOON BOAT?

06:35.926 --> 06:38.829
YEAH, THE PONTOON BOAT
WITH THE BROKEN GAS GAUGE.

06:38.829 --> 06:40.631
AND I KEPT TELLING EVERYBODY,
"DON'T WORRY.

06:40.631 --> 06:43.003
THEY'LL COME LOOKING FOR US."
 AND THEN THE SUN
STARTED TO GO DOWN.

06:43.003 --> 06:44.805
WHO KNEW MIKE WAS
SUCH A GREAT SWIMMER?

06:44.805 --> 06:47.438
I KNOW. IT WAS HALF A MILE TO
SHORE, AT LEAST, IN COLD WATER.

06:47.438 --> 06:50.581
HE WAS AN AMAZING GUY.

06:53.544 --> 06:55.446
(crying) I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M NEVER GONNA SEE HIM

06:55.446 --> 06:58.418
WALK OUT OF THAT HOUSE AGAIN.

07:00.651 --> 07:01.792
(sniffles)

07:04.555 --> 07:07.427
(exhales deeply)

07:07.427 --> 07:09.860
(sniffles) I'M SORRY.

07:09.860 --> 07:12.603
I'VE BEEN DOING A REALLY GOOD
JOB KEEPING IT TOGETHER

07:12.603 --> 07:13.664
UNTIL NOW.

07:13.664 --> 07:16.637
I'M SO SORRY, LYNETTE.

07:16.637 --> 07:18.739
HE REALLY SEEMED LIKE
A GOOD GUY.

07:18.739 --> 07:21.512
YEAH. HE WAS A GREAT GUY.

07:23.744 --> 07:25.846
WELL, WE SHOULD
PROBABLY GET GOING.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.949
HEY.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.951
YOU WANT TO RIDE WITH US
TO THE CHURCH?

07:36.056 --> 07:39.490
NO. I STILL HAVE TO GET READY.

07:39.490 --> 07:42.132
SO YOU GUYS GO AHEAD.

07:44.234 --> 07:45.966
HEY, BREE.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.899
OH. PLEASE TELL ME YOU'RE NOT
WEARING THAT TO THE FUNERAL.

07:48.899 --> 07:51.071
UH, ACTUALLY THAT'S WHY
I WAS COMING OVER.

07:51.071 --> 07:52.903
I'M NOT GOING TO THE FUNERAL,

07:52.903 --> 07:55.876
SO COULD YOU PLEASE TELL SUSAN
HOW SORRY I AM?

07:55.876 --> 07:58.148
YOU HAVE TO BE THERE.
THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD IS GOING.

07:58.148 --> 08:00.150
UH, YEAH, AND THEY'LL
ALL BE THINKING,

08:00.150 --> 08:02.012
"THERE'S THE WOMAN
THAT MIKE WAS PROTECTING

08:02.012 --> 08:03.984
"WHEN HE BEAT UP
THAT LOAN SHARK.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.556
SHE'S THE REASON HE'S DEAD."

08:05.556 --> 08:06.657
RENEE--

08:06.657 --> 08:08.118
MIKE STUCK HIS NECK OUT
FOR ME,

08:08.118 --> 08:09.660
AND NOW SUSAN'S A WIDOW,

08:09.660 --> 08:12.122
AND A 9-YEAR-OLD KID HAS TO
GROW UP WITHOUT A FATHER.

08:12.122 --> 08:14.665
LOOK, I KNOW YOU FEEL AWFUL
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED,

08:14.665 --> 08:16.797
BUT TODAY IS ABOUT
HONORING MIKE.

08:16.797 --> 08:19.730
YOU DO NOT GET TO MAKE THIS
ABOUT YOUR GUILT.

08:19.730 --> 08:22.533
(sighs)

08:22.533 --> 08:24.635
WHY ARE YOU LOOKING AT ME
LIKE THAT?

08:24.635 --> 08:26.506
BECAUSE YOU'RE RIGHT,

08:26.506 --> 08:28.138
AND IT'S ANNOYING.

08:28.138 --> 08:30.180
COME ON.

08:30.180 --> 08:32.582
GO GET CHANGED,
AND I WILL SAVE YOU A SEAT.

08:32.582 --> 08:34.585
UGH. I REALLY HATE TODAY.

08:34.585 --> 08:36.746
ME, TOO.

08:36.746 --> 08:37.818
(car door slams)

08:37.818 --> 08:39.519
MRS. VAN DE KAMP?

08:39.519 --> 08:40.591
CAN I HELP YOU?

08:40.591 --> 08:43.554
I'M DETECTIVE HEREDIA,
FAIRVIEW P.D.

08:43.554 --> 08:46.627
OH. UH, IF THIS IS ABOUT
MIKE DELFINO'S MURDER,

08:46.627 --> 08:48.729
I'D BE HAPPY TO HELP,
BUT...

08:48.729 --> 08:51.261
AS YOU CAN SEE,
I'M ON MY WAY TO HIS FUNERAL.

08:51.261 --> 08:53.864
ACTUALLY, WE ALREADY MADE
AN ARREST IN THAT CASE.

08:53.864 --> 08:55.566
THANK GOD.

08:55.566 --> 08:56.707
I'M HERE
ON AN UNRELATED MATTER.

08:56.707 --> 08:58.939
IT'S A MISSING PERSONS
INVESTIGATION.

08:58.939 --> 09:00.571
OH?

09:00.571 --> 09:02.813
YEAH, I'D LIKE YOU TO COME DOWN
AND ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS.

09:02.813 --> 09:04.845
NOW?

09:04.845 --> 09:06.546
PLEASE.

09:18.659 --> 09:21.732
AS SHE ARRIVED
AT MIKE DELFINO'S FUNERAL,

09:21.732 --> 09:26.196
GABY CONSIDERED WHAT HER FRIEND
SUSAN MUST BE GOING THROUGH.

09:26.196 --> 09:31.201
AFTER ALL, MIKE WAS
THE LOVE OF SUSAN'S LIFE,

09:31.201 --> 09:34.044
AND THAT GOT GABY THINKING

09:34.044 --> 09:36.677
ABOUT THE LOVE OF HERS.

09:41.251 --> 09:42.813
(giggles)

09:42.813 --> 09:45.686
SO... (sighs)
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

09:45.686 --> 09:49.119
A LOT OF THINGS.

09:49.119 --> 09:51.261
MOST OF THEM OBSCENE.

09:51.261 --> 09:52.723
(laughs) I LIKE IT, TOO!

09:52.723 --> 09:56.296
IT'S ROYAL WEDDING WITH
JUST A HINT OF SLUT. (giggles)

09:56.296 --> 09:57.768
SO... HOW MUCH?

09:57.768 --> 10:00.070
WHO CARES?
YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,

10:00.070 --> 10:02.803
AND YOU ARE GETTING THIS.

10:02.803 --> 10:05.776
(giggles)

10:05.776 --> 10:09.109
$12,000? DIOS MIO.

10:09.109 --> 10:12.242
WE DIDN'T EVEN PAY THIS MUCH
FOR OUR FIRST HOUSE.

10:12.242 --> 10:14.244
YEAH, WELL, HOW MUCH
CAN MUD AND STRAW COST?

10:14.244 --> 10:15.285
LADIES.

10:15.285 --> 10:18.018
(sighs) WE ARE
HAVING A NICE TIME.

10:18.018 --> 10:20.751
LET'S TRY
AND KEEP IT THAT WAY.

10:20.751 --> 10:23.724
NOW BE HONEST, MAMA.
DON'T YOU LIKE THE DRESS?

10:25.656 --> 10:27.728
DOES IT ONLY COME IN WHITE?

10:28.829 --> 10:32.803
I'M JUST SAYING,
SHE'S NOT FOOLING ANYBODY.

10:32.803 --> 10:35.135
WELL, I THINK
SHE LOOKS BEAUTIFUL.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.636
WE'LL TAKE IT.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.068
NO.

10:38.068 --> 10:41.041
I WILL NOT LET YOU SPEND MONEY
LIKE THAT.

10:41.041 --> 10:43.273
UH, COULD YOU GIVE US A MOMENT?

10:46.977 --> 10:49.780
UGH.

10:49.780 --> 10:51.051
(Carlos)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:51.051 --> 10:54.024
SHE LOVES THE DRESS,
AND YOU KEEP INSULTING IT.

10:54.024 --> 10:56.256
YOU JUST DON'T GET IT,
DO YOU, CARLOS?

10:56.256 --> 10:58.328
THIS IS ONLY THE BEGINNING.

10:58.328 --> 11:02.032
YOU GIVE IN TO HER WITH THIS
DRESS, SHE'LL BLEED YOU DRY.

11:02.032 --> 11:05.766
TRUST ME.
THAT WOMAN IS A GOLD DIGGER.

11:05.766 --> 11:07.898
(whispers) HIT HER, CARLOS.
HIT HER.

11:07.898 --> 11:09.870
(clears throat) MAMA,

11:09.870 --> 11:11.772
YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU,

11:11.772 --> 11:15.806
BUT IF YOU SAY ONE MORE
CRITICAL THING ABOUT GABY,

11:15.806 --> 11:17.948
DON'T BOTHER
COMING TO OUR WEDDING.

11:17.948 --> 11:21.181
UNDERSTOOD?

11:22.913 --> 11:24.815
WELL, I GUESS
YOU'VE MADE YOUR CHOICE.

11:24.815 --> 11:28.088
I JUST HOPE SHE REALIZES
HOW LUCKY SHE IS.

11:28.088 --> 11:29.860
MM. NO.

11:29.860 --> 11:31.722
I AM THE LUCKY ONE.

11:31.722 --> 11:34.264
I'VE NEVER MET
ANYONE LIKE HER,

11:34.264 --> 11:37.928
AND WHEN SHE SMILES AT ME,
YOU CAN'T PUT A PRICE ON IT.

11:37.928 --> 11:41.071
SO I DON'T CARE
IF I HAVE TO WORK

11:41.071 --> 11:43.203
20 HOURS A DAY
TO KEEP HER HAPPY.

11:43.203 --> 11:46.036
I'LL DO IT.

11:46.036 --> 11:48.278
(inhales deeply)

11:48.278 --> 11:49.840
CARLOS, SWEETIE,

11:49.840 --> 11:53.713
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD REALLY MAKE
THIS DRESS POP IS...

11:53.713 --> 11:55.115
OH.

11:55.115 --> 11:56.787
NO, I SHOULDN'T.

11:56.787 --> 11:58.849
TELL ME. WHAT?

11:58.849 --> 12:00.050
WELL,
IT'S PROBABLY TOO MUCH,

12:00.050 --> 12:03.153
BUT A PAIR
OF DIAMOND EARRINGS?

12:03.153 --> 12:05.355
THEN OUR NEXT STOP IS
A JEWELRY STORE.

12:05.355 --> 12:07.457
(giggles and squeals)

12:09.059 --> 12:11.201
MM.

12:14.304 --> 12:17.968
HEY. WHAT ARE THOSE STAINS
ON THE LIVING ROOM RUG?

12:17.968 --> 12:20.470
THE GREEN IS JUANITA'S PUKE,
THE YELLOW IS CELIA'S PUKE,

12:20.470 --> 12:22.212
AND THE RED IS MY MERLOT.

12:22.212 --> 12:24.414
SINCE WHEN ARE YOU DRINKING WINE
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON?

12:24.414 --> 12:27.047
SINCE THE GIRLS STARTED PUKING
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON.

12:27.047 --> 12:28.318
(bell dings)

12:28.318 --> 12:30.951
YOUR SOUP IS COMING, JUANITA!

12:30.951 --> 12:32.182
(air horn blows)

12:32.182 --> 12:34.084
YES, CELIA, YOURS, TOO!

12:34.084 --> 12:35.285
(sighs)

12:36.987 --> 12:39.029
HERE. MY SHIFT IS OVER.

12:39.029 --> 12:40.760
NO. NO. NO. NO. NO.
I CAN'T, GABY. NOT TONIGHT.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.232
WHY NOT?
I'VE BEEN WITH THEM

12:42.232 --> 12:43.934
SINCE THEY GOT
THE STUPID STOMACH FLU.

12:43.934 --> 12:46.036
I HAVEN'T SLEPT IN FOUR DAYS.
I NEED A BREAK, CARLOS.

12:46.036 --> 12:48.939
TOMORROW MORNING, TEN CLIENTS
FROM JAPAN ARE FLYING IN,

12:48.939 --> 12:51.771
AND IN ORDER FOR ME
TO WIN THEIR GIANT ACCOUNT,

12:51.771 --> 12:53.203
I HAVE TO WOW THEM WITH

12:53.203 --> 12:55.545
A PowerPoint PRESENTATION THAT
I HAVE NOT EVEN STARTED YET.

12:55.545 --> 12:58.208
ALL I HEAR IS "BLAHBETY-BLAH.
JAPAN. BLAHBETY BLAH."

12:58.208 --> 13:00.550
I NEED A MASSAGE.
 (bell dings)

13:00.550 --> 13:02.953
OH, MY GOD. NOT AGAIN.

13:02.953 --> 13:06.186
EVERY TIME A BELL RINGS,
AN ANGEL DOES NOT GET ITS WINGS.

13:06.186 --> 13:08.088
A CHILD ALMOST GETS HIT!

13:08.088 --> 13:10.290
IT'S JUST ENDLESS.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.122
IF SOMETHING ISN'T COMING OUT
OF THEIR MOUTHS,

13:12.122 --> 13:13.994
IT'S COMING OUT
OF THEIR BUTTS.

13:13.994 --> 13:15.966
EVERY OPENING IS
ON FULL SERVICE.

13:15.966 --> 13:17.968
I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE.
I'M STARTING TO LOSE MY MIND!

13:17.968 --> 13:19.029
OKAY.

13:19.029 --> 13:20.330
OKAY.

13:20.330 --> 13:23.273
GO GET YOUR MASSAGE. I WILL
TAKE CARE OF THEM TONIGHT.

13:23.273 --> 13:26.006
WHAT ABOUT JAPAN?

13:26.006 --> 13:28.338
THIS IS MORE IMPORTANT.

13:28.338 --> 13:31.311
I TOLD YOU I WOULD
ALWAYS TAKE CARE OF YOU.

13:31.311 --> 13:32.382
(kiss)

13:32.382 --> 13:35.245
GO. GO GET YOUR MASSAGE.

13:35.245 --> 13:39.249
HEY, GIRLS! DADDY'S HOME!
I GOT YOUR SOUP!

13:39.249 --> 13:41.151
(knock on door)

13:41.151 --> 13:43.023
(singsongy)
SURPRISE TACO VISIT.

13:43.023 --> 13:45.525
(normal voice) DON'T GET TOO
EXCITED. THAT'S NOT A EUPHEMISM.

13:45.525 --> 13:48.959
HEY, BABE, I'M KIND OF
IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING.

13:48.959 --> 13:50.961
WHAT ARE YOU IN THE MIDDLE OF?
OBVIOUSLY NOT SHAVING

13:50.961 --> 13:52.832
OR PUTTING ON DEODORANT.
YOU LOOK LIKE A TERRORIST.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.464
CAN YOU PLEASE
JUST COME BACK LATER?

13:54.464 --> 13:56.466
OKAY. I MEAN,

13:56.466 --> 13:59.139
I THOUGHT IT'D BE NICE TO HAVE
LUNCH TOGETHER, BUT FINE.

13:59.139 --> 14:01.471
I'LL JUST LEAVE THESE FOR YOU.

14:01.471 --> 14:03.373
(Carlos sighs)

14:03.373 --> 14:04.574
MIKE?

14:04.574 --> 14:07.377
HEY, GABY.

14:07.377 --> 14:09.549
SO MIKE GETS TO COME VISIT,
BUT NOT ME?

14:09.549 --> 14:12.482
MIKE IS JUST BEING A FRIEND.
HE GETS WHAT I'M GOING THROUGH.

14:12.482 --> 14:14.084
AH, I DID MY OWN LITTLE STINT
IN REHAB.

14:14.084 --> 14:15.485
I KNOW HOW HARD THIS CAN BE.

14:15.485 --> 14:18.528
RIGHT. WHAT DO I KNOW?
I'M ONLY HIS WIFE.

14:20.090 --> 14:22.032
(sighs)

14:23.293 --> 14:26.366
GABY. GABY, WAIT.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.969
HE'S A LITTLE ON EDGE RIGHT NOW.
CUT HIM SOME SLACK.

14:28.969 --> 14:31.101
YOU THINK I CAME HERE
TO GIVE HIM A HARD TIME?

14:31.101 --> 14:33.143
I JUST WANT
TO BE HERE FOR HIM.

14:33.143 --> 14:34.874
YEAH, BUT YOU BEING HERE
JUST REMINDS HIM

14:34.874 --> 14:37.107
HOW HE'S MESSING EVERYTHING UP.
HE FEELS LIKE HE'S FAILING YOU.

14:37.107 --> 14:40.180
OH, THAT'S RIDICULOUS.
 WHY DO YOU THINK
HE'S PUSHING YOU AWAY?

14:40.180 --> 14:42.312
HE CAN'T STAND
YOU SEEING HIM LIKE THIS,

14:42.312 --> 14:44.955
AND FRANKLY, I THINK
HE'S A LITTLE SCARED.

14:44.955 --> 14:46.516
OF WHAT?

14:46.516 --> 14:49.059
HE'S ALWAYS PROVIDED FOR YOU,

14:49.059 --> 14:51.091
AND IF YOU THINK
HE CAN'T DO THAT ANYMORE,

14:51.091 --> 14:52.963
HE'S AFRAID
YOU MIGHT LEAVE HIM.

15:00.030 --> 15:03.103
MIKE WAS A GOOD MAN...

15:04.975 --> 15:06.506
AND SO ARE YOU.

15:08.038 --> 15:10.910
YOU SHOULD QUIT YOUR JOB.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.082
WHAT? BUT YOU SAID THAT--

15:12.082 --> 15:13.944
I WAS WRONG.

15:13.944 --> 15:16.016
IF BEING A COUNSELOR'S
GONNA MAKE YOU HAPPY,

15:16.016 --> 15:18.088
THEN THAT'S
WHAT YOU SHOULD DO.

15:28.558 --> 15:30.200
AS LYNETTE LOOKED
AT A WEDDING PHOTO

15:30.200 --> 15:32.462
OF SUSAN AND MIKE,

15:32.462 --> 15:36.306
SHE THOUGHT ABOUT THE TRAGIC
END OF THEIR MARRIAGE,

15:36.306 --> 15:41.311
AND THAT STARTED HER THINKING
ABOUT THE BEGINNING OF HER OWN.

15:44.944 --> 15:46.016
OH, I GOT THIS.

15:46.016 --> 15:48.078
NO. NO. NO. NO. NO.
I GOT IT. (chuckles)

15:48.078 --> 15:49.279
WHY? 'CAUSE YOU'RE THE GUY?

15:49.279 --> 15:52.422
NO, BECAUSE I ASKED YOU OUT.
IT'S ONLY FAIR.

15:52.422 --> 15:54.384
LET ME GET IT.

15:54.384 --> 15:56.426
NO. NEXT TIME.

15:56.426 --> 15:58.628
NEXT TIME?

15:58.628 --> 16:00.660
YOU'RE ASKING ME OUT
ON A SECOND DATE?

16:03.063 --> 16:04.664
ABSO-TIVELY.

16:04.664 --> 16:06.966
OKAY, BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW
I HAVE A 3-DATE RULE

16:06.966 --> 16:09.499
BEFORE I EVEN CONSIDER
SLEEPING WITH SOMEONE.

16:09.499 --> 16:11.001
(chuckles)

16:11.001 --> 16:14.104
FOR THE RECORD, I WASN'T,
UH, EXPECTING ANYTHING.

16:14.104 --> 16:17.077
THAT SAID, IF YOU TAKE ME OUT
FOR COFFEE NOW,

16:17.077 --> 16:20.080
I WOULD BE WILLING TO CONSIDER
 THAT A SECOND DATE.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.082
AND WHAT IF AFTER THAT,
I OFFERED YOU

16:22.082 --> 16:25.155
HALF THE CANDY BAR
I HAVE IN MY GLOVE COMPARTMENT?

16:25.155 --> 16:28.018
WOULD THAT COUNT
AS A THIRD DATE?

16:28.018 --> 16:29.159
(chuckles)

16:29.159 --> 16:31.461
LET'S HAVE THE COFFEE FIRST

16:31.461 --> 16:33.693
AND SEE HOW IT GOES,
SHALL WE?

16:33.693 --> 16:36.626
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

16:36.626 --> 16:40.430
(chuckles) SO DO WE NEED
TO TELL H.R. ABOUT THIS?

16:40.430 --> 16:42.302
WHY WOULD WE?

16:42.302 --> 16:44.074
WELL, I THINK
THEY WANT TO KNOW

16:44.074 --> 16:46.176
WHEN EMPLOYEES GET
IN A RELATIONSHIP.

16:46.176 --> 16:48.408
TOM, WE DON'T HAVE TO DO
THE WHOLE RELATIONSHIP THING.

16:48.408 --> 16:50.410
I AM NOT ONE OF THOSE GIRLS

16:50.410 --> 16:53.643
LOOKING FOR A RING AND KIDS
AND A HOUSE IN THE SUBURBS.

16:53.643 --> 16:56.546
ALTHOUGH I AM KIND OF PARTIAL
TO WHITE PICKET FENCES.

16:56.546 --> 16:58.588
YOU DON'T THINK
THERE'S ANYBODY OUT THERE

16:58.588 --> 17:00.520
WHO CAN
MAKE YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND?

17:00.520 --> 17:02.352
NOT FOR THE NEXT SEVEN YEARS.

17:02.352 --> 17:05.555
I HAVE THIS WHOLE PLAN
WHERE I BECOME VICE PRESIDENT.

17:05.555 --> 17:08.098
OF THE UNITED STATES?

17:08.098 --> 17:09.699
(laughs)

17:09.699 --> 17:12.801
I MEANT THE COMPANY,
BUT WE'LL SEE.

17:17.137 --> 17:19.368
OKAY. CAN I LOOK NOW?
MY BACK IS ACHING,

17:19.368 --> 17:22.311
MY ANKLES ARE SWOLLEN, AND YOUR
HANDS SMELL LIKE CHEESE.

17:22.311 --> 17:24.144
(laughs)

17:24.144 --> 17:25.575
(gasps)
 TA-DA!

17:25.575 --> 17:28.117
WHAT IS THIS?

17:28.117 --> 17:30.250
IT'S YOUR DREAM HOUSE.

17:30.250 --> 17:32.322
SOMEONE ALREADY BOUGHT IT.

17:32.322 --> 17:35.455
YEAH, I DID, FOR YOU.

17:35.455 --> 17:36.556
OW!

17:36.556 --> 17:37.657
WHAT THE HELL'S WRONG
WITH YOU?

17:37.657 --> 17:39.229
YOU DON'T JUST BUY
SOMEONE A HOUSE.

17:39.229 --> 17:41.831
THE EXCEPTION TO THE RULE
BEING DREAM HOUSES.

17:41.831 --> 17:44.094
NO, YOU STILL
SHOULD'VE CONSULTED ME.

17:44.094 --> 17:46.466
THIS IS A DECISION WE'RE
SUPPOSED TO MAKE TOGETHER

17:46.466 --> 17:47.737
AND...
(inhales sharply) OW!

17:47.737 --> 17:49.299
OH, CRAMP. OH, MY FOOT.

17:49.299 --> 17:50.640
HERE. SIT DOWN.
 OKAY.

17:50.640 --> 17:52.202
SIT DOWN.

17:52.202 --> 17:53.303
(groans) HERE.

17:53.303 --> 17:55.145
WHERE IS IT? RIGHT THERE?
 RIGHT THERE. RIGHT THERE.

17:55.145 --> 17:56.646
(sighs)

17:56.646 --> 17:58.208
COME ON.

17:58.208 --> 18:01.181
ADMIT IT.
THIS IS KIND OF NICE.

18:01.181 --> 18:03.153
YEAH, IT'S NICE,

18:03.153 --> 18:05.155
BUT...

18:05.155 --> 18:07.157
I HAVE CERTAIN THINGS
I WANT IN A HOME.

18:07.157 --> 18:10.089
I KNOW. LIKE A-A TREE HOUSE
FOR THE TWINS TO PLAY IN.

18:10.089 --> 18:12.192
THERE'S THE PERFECT TREE
FOR IT.

18:12.192 --> 18:13.423
AND AN HERB GARDEN--

18:13.423 --> 18:15.865
THERE'S A GREAT SPOT
ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HOUSE.

18:15.865 --> 18:18.268
AND OF COURSE,

18:18.268 --> 18:21.331
YOUR WHITE PICKET FENCE, JUST
LIKE YOU ALWAYS DREAMED ABOUT.

18:22.732 --> 18:26.336
WAIT. I NEVER SAID ANYTHING
ABOUT A WHITE PICKET FENCE.

18:26.336 --> 18:28.408
SURE, YOU DID.
ON OUR FIRST DATE.

18:28.408 --> 18:30.280
YOU SAID YOU WERE A SUCKER
FOR A WHITE PICKET FENCE.

18:30.280 --> 18:32.512
THERE'S NO WAY I SAID THAT
ON OUR FIRST DATE.

18:32.512 --> 18:35.385
YOU DID. I REMEMBER,
BECAUSE AS SOON AS YOU SAID IT,

18:35.385 --> 18:38.117
I GOT THIS IMAGE OF US
SITTING ON OUR PORCH,

18:38.117 --> 18:40.890
WATCHING OUR KIDS PLAY
WHILE WE DRINK LEMONADE

18:40.890 --> 18:43.193
AND LOOK OUT OVER
OUR WHITE PICKET FENCE.

18:46.196 --> 18:48.258
YEAH, THIS DOES
SEEM LIKE A NICE PLACE.

18:48.258 --> 18:50.860
(birds chirping)

18:50.860 --> 18:52.562
I'M SORRY
I DID THIS WITHOUT YOU,

18:52.562 --> 18:54.864
BUT I KNEW,

18:54.864 --> 18:57.407
WHEN I SAW THIS HOUSE,
THAT YOU WOULD LOVE IT.

18:58.908 --> 19:01.441
BECAUSE I KNOW YOU
BETTER THAN ANYONE.

19:04.314 --> 19:05.315
MM.

19:05.315 --> 19:06.145
MM.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.917
MM.

19:07.917 --> 19:09.179
OW!

19:09.179 --> 19:10.280
(chuckles)

19:13.223 --> 19:14.754
(grunts)

19:16.186 --> 19:18.888
HERE. THESE ARE YOURS, TOO.
 AH.

19:18.888 --> 19:21.861
THANKS. UM, DO YOU MIND IF I
TAKE THE PORTABLE CD PLAYER?

19:21.861 --> 19:23.193
THE ONE I USE
WHILE I'M COOKING?

19:23.193 --> 19:25.295
HOW ELSE
AM I GONNA PLAY MY CDs?

19:25.295 --> 19:27.637
YEAH. SURE. TAKE IT.

19:27.637 --> 19:29.168
OKAY. THANKS.

19:31.471 --> 19:33.343
(door opens and closes)

19:33.343 --> 19:35.174
HOW YOU DOING?

19:35.174 --> 19:37.577
GREAT. IT'S ALL THE FUN
OF A GARAGE SALE

19:37.577 --> 19:39.349
WITHOUT MAKING ANY MONEY

19:39.349 --> 19:42.452
AND ONLY GETTING RID
OF STUFF YOU REALLY LIKE.

19:42.452 --> 19:44.183
WHY AREN'T YOU
FIGHTING HARDER?

19:44.183 --> 19:46.216
IT'S JUST A CD PLAYER.

19:46.216 --> 19:48.318
I'M TALKING
ABOUT YOUR MARRIAGE.

19:48.318 --> 19:50.690
LYNETTE, YOU KNOW ME.

19:50.690 --> 19:53.192
I HATE TALKING ABOUT THIS STUFF,
BUT EVERYBODY ON THE STREET

19:53.192 --> 19:56.266
KNOWS YOU AND TOM ARE
SUPPOSED TO BE TOGETHER.

19:56.266 --> 19:58.368
I DON'T KNOW.

19:58.368 --> 20:00.300
AT THIS POINT,
THERE'S SO MANY BAD FEELINGS,

20:00.300 --> 20:02.402
I THINK TIME APART
WILL HELP US.

20:02.402 --> 20:04.704
IT WON'T.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.205
(suitcase thuds)

20:06.205 --> 20:07.507
(sighs)

20:07.507 --> 20:09.239
I'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS.
ALL RIGHT, I KNOW HOW IT GOES.

20:09.239 --> 20:10.510
EACH OF YOU WAITING
FOR THE OTHER ONE

20:10.510 --> 20:13.383
TO ADMIT THEY WERE WRONG,
BEG TO BE TAKEN BACK.

20:13.383 --> 20:15.445
THE PROBLEM IS,
THE WHOLE TIME YOU'RE WAITING,

20:15.445 --> 20:17.447
YOU'RE JUST GROWING
FURTHER APART.

20:17.447 --> 20:19.549
BUT YOU AND SUSAN
GOT BACK TOGETHER.

20:19.549 --> 20:22.422
AND I KICK MYSELF EVERY DAY
FOR LETTING IT TAKE SO LONG.

20:22.422 --> 20:24.754
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS,

20:24.754 --> 20:27.297
SOMEBODY'S GOTTA MAKE
THE FIRST MOVE.

20:27.297 --> 20:29.228
I CAN'T RIGHT NOW.

20:29.228 --> 20:31.261
I'M TOO ANGRY.

20:31.261 --> 20:33.363
AND ONE DAY YOU WON'T BE.

20:33.363 --> 20:35.405
I HOPE IT'S NOT TOO LATE.

20:35.405 --> 20:37.707
FOR EITHER ONE OF YOU.

20:42.312 --> 20:44.644
DON'T LET IT BOTHER YOU,
HONEY.

20:44.644 --> 20:45.645
WHAT?

20:45.645 --> 20:47.817
TOM, SHOWING UP
WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND.

20:49.319 --> 20:50.950
IT'S FINE.

20:50.950 --> 20:53.353
I ACTUALLY DON'T THINK IT'S
GONNA LAST THAT MUCH LONGER.

20:53.353 --> 20:55.024
YEAH? YOU HEARD SOMETHING?

20:56.456 --> 20:58.788
NO, I DECIDED SOMETHING.

21:06.536 --> 21:08.738
BREE VAN DE KAMP
FOUND HERSELF HELPLESS

21:08.738 --> 21:11.040
IN THE FACE OF A POWERFUL MAN.

21:11.040 --> 21:13.843
AND THIS GOT HER THINKING

21:13.843 --> 21:17.477
ABOUT THE WAYS SHE'D HANDLED
POWERFUL MEN BEFORE

21:17.477 --> 21:20.510
AND HOW SHE'D LEARNED TO DO IT.

21:26.386 --> 21:27.657
BREE.

21:27.657 --> 21:29.519
WHAT ARE YOU MAKING?

21:29.519 --> 21:31.591
HONEY PECAN PIE.

21:31.591 --> 21:33.393
IT'S YOUR FATHER'S FAVORITE.

21:33.393 --> 21:34.764
CAN I HELP?

21:34.764 --> 21:35.965
PIE'S DONE,

21:35.965 --> 21:39.669
BUT I CAN TEACH YOU
HOW TO MAKE WHIPPED CREAM.

21:42.402 --> 21:43.933
OF COURSE
THERE'S SO MANY THINGS

21:43.933 --> 21:45.905
I SHOULD PROBABLY
TEACH YOU FIRST.

21:45.905 --> 21:47.437
LIKE WHAT?

21:48.578 --> 21:51.881
LIKE... HOW TO BE A WOMAN.

21:51.881 --> 21:56.586
THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT
LESSON I CAN PASS DOWN.

21:56.586 --> 22:00.790
AS THE CREAM THICKENS, YOU WHIP
IT A LITTLE FASTER, OKAY?

22:00.790 --> 22:03.353
DON'T I BECOME A WOMAN
JUST BY GETTING OLDER?

22:03.353 --> 22:04.624
OH, NO, BREE.

22:04.624 --> 22:07.397
THERE'S SOME THINGS
YOU'RE TOO YOUNG TO UNDERSTAND,

22:07.397 --> 22:09.559
BUT...

22:09.559 --> 22:12.732
I THINK YOU'RE OLD ENOUGH
TO LEARN ABOUT THE MASK.

22:12.732 --> 22:14.504
THE MASK?

22:14.504 --> 22:16.806
IT'S WHAT MY MOTHER CALLED IT.
IT'S THE FACE YOU WEAR

22:16.806 --> 22:20.109
WHEN YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE
TO KNOW WHAT YOU'RE FEELING.

22:20.109 --> 22:23.443
ALL WELL-BROUGHT-UP WOMEN
CONCEAL THEIR EMOTIONS.

22:23.443 --> 22:26.876
IT'S VERY USEFUL, ESPECIALLY
WHEN DEALING WITH MEN.

22:26.876 --> 22:28.117
WHY?

22:28.117 --> 22:31.120
WELL, IF A MAN
KNOWS WHAT YOU'RE THINKING,

22:31.120 --> 22:32.822
IT GIVES HIM POWER OVER YOU.

22:32.822 --> 22:35.655
FOR EXAMPLE,

22:35.655 --> 22:38.458
IF A MAN KNOWS
HOW MUCH YOU LOVE HIM,

22:38.458 --> 22:41.130
HE'LL TAKE YOU FOR GRANTED.
HE'LL HURT YOU--

22:41.130 --> 22:43.493
CARELESSLY,

22:43.493 --> 22:45.795
CRUELLY,

22:45.795 --> 22:46.836
CONSTANTLY.

22:46.836 --> 22:47.697
(plop)

22:49.499 --> 22:51.140
DOES DADDY KNOW
THAT YOU LOVE HIM?

22:51.140 --> 22:53.803
YES. I HAVE
TOLD HIM REPEATEDLY

22:53.803 --> 22:56.005
THAT I CANNOT LIVE
WITHOUT HIM.

22:56.005 --> 22:58.648
IF YOU'RE SO UPSET WITH HIM,

22:58.648 --> 23:00.810
WHY ARE YOU MAKING
HIS FAVORITE PIE?

23:00.810 --> 23:02.812
BECAUSE AFTER
ALL OF THESE YEARS,

23:02.812 --> 23:05.084
I'VE FORGOTTEN
HOW TO WEAR MY MASK.

23:05.084 --> 23:08.788
SO NOW I MUST DO THINGS
TO DISTRACT DADDY.

23:08.788 --> 23:11.621
LIKE THIS PIE.

23:11.621 --> 23:14.724
WHEN I BRING IT OUT,
HE'LL BE SO EXCITED,

23:14.724 --> 23:16.966
HE WON'T NOTICE
THE DEVASTATION IN MY EYES.

23:16.966 --> 23:19.769
DEVASTATION?

23:19.769 --> 23:21.130
MM-HMM. IT'S AN EMOTION.

23:21.130 --> 23:23.102
THE KIND YOU MIGHT FEEL
WHEN YOUR FRIEND CALLS

23:23.102 --> 23:24.974
TO SAY
YOUR HUSBAND'S LeSABRE

23:24.974 --> 23:27.837
WAS SEEN IN THE PARKING LOT
OF A CERTAIN MOTEL,

23:27.837 --> 23:31.180
NEXT TO
HIS SECRETARY'S BONNEVILLE.

23:32.782 --> 23:34.884
PRACTICE YOUR MASK.

23:36.415 --> 23:37.717
OH, NO. (chuckles)

23:37.717 --> 23:38.988
HONEY, THAT'S TOO MUCH.

23:38.988 --> 23:42.592
ALL YOU NEED IS
THE HINT OF A SMILE.

23:43.753 --> 23:44.924
PERFECT.

23:44.924 --> 23:46.696
WHEN AN EXPRESSION LIKE THAT,

23:46.696 --> 23:49.799
NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE REALLY THINKING.

23:49.799 --> 23:52.161
AND I'LL HAVE POWER
OVER MEN?

23:54.063 --> 23:56.035
GOD, I HOPE SO.

23:56.035 --> 23:57.507
(plop)

24:05.645 --> 24:07.777
(door closes)

24:07.777 --> 24:10.620
(sighs deeply)

24:10.620 --> 24:12.221
WHY ARE YOU ANGRY?

24:12.221 --> 24:14.754
WHO SAYS I'M ANGRY?

24:14.754 --> 24:17.927
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,
YOU DON'T THINK I CAN READ YOU?

24:17.927 --> 24:21.761
WELL, IF I'M SUCH AN OPEN BOOK,
WHAT AM I ANGRY ABOUT?

24:21.761 --> 24:24.193
SO YOU ADMIT YOU'RE ANGRY.

24:24.193 --> 24:25.865
I ADMIT NO SUCH THING.

24:29.869 --> 24:31.200
(sighs)

24:31.200 --> 24:33.773
YOU KNOW...

24:33.773 --> 24:35.074
THIS THING YOU'RE DOING...

24:35.074 --> 24:37.877
AND WHAT THING WOULD THAT BE?

24:37.877 --> 24:40.850
YOU PUT ON THIS PLASTIC FACE

24:40.850 --> 24:43.783
TO KEEP ME IN THE DARK ABOUT
WHAT YOU'RE REALLY FEELING.

24:43.783 --> 24:46.255
A-AND I WALK AROUND
ON EGGSHELLS FOR DAYS,

24:46.255 --> 24:49.058
NOT KNOWING WHICH END IS UP.

24:49.058 --> 24:51.861
WELL,
MAYBE I DON'T FEEL SAFE

24:51.861 --> 24:54.864
SHARING EVERY SINGLE THOUGHT
AND EMOTION I HAVE WITH YOU.

24:54.864 --> 24:56.826
HMM.

24:56.826 --> 24:59.829
WELL, THAT'S A HORRIBLE THING
TO SAY.

24:59.829 --> 25:02.001
(refrigerator door closes)

25:02.001 --> 25:04.534
OF COURSE YOU CAN FEEL SAFE
WITH ME.

25:04.534 --> 25:07.136
I'M YOUR HUSBAND.

25:07.136 --> 25:08.778
I LOVE YOU.

25:09.879 --> 25:11.881
PLEASE.

25:14.113 --> 25:16.746
OKAY.

25:16.746 --> 25:18.517
AFTER DESSERT,

25:18.517 --> 25:20.950
YOU PAID A CERTAIN...

25:20.950 --> 25:23.092
COMPLIMENT TO GABRIELLE.

25:24.854 --> 25:26.055
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING.

25:26.055 --> 25:27.657
IT WAS HURTFUL.

25:27.657 --> 25:30.960
(laughs)

25:30.960 --> 25:32.562
TO WHO?

25:32.562 --> 25:34.233
TO ME.

25:34.233 --> 25:38.067
YOU TOLD HER SHE WAS THE MOST
GORGEOUS WOMAN YOU'D EVER MET.

25:38.067 --> 25:40.009
SHE WAS A MODEL.
 I DON'T CARE.

25:40.009 --> 25:43.312
YOU DON'T SAY THAT WITH YOUR
WIFE STANDING RIGHT NEXT TO YOU.

25:43.312 --> 25:45.845
I'M GOING TO BED.

25:45.845 --> 25:47.977
NOW?

25:49.779 --> 25:52.782
YOU WANTED TO KNOW
WHAT I WAS FEELING.

25:52.782 --> 25:54.654
I'M FEELING...

25:54.654 --> 25:56.826
HURT AND HUMILIATED.

25:56.826 --> 26:00.029
AND I THINK YOU'RE DUMB
TO FEEL THOSE THINGS.

26:04.063 --> 26:06.265
ARE YOU COMING TO BED?

26:06.265 --> 26:09.298
OR ARE YOU JUST GONNA
STAY DOWN HERE AND POUT?

26:09.298 --> 26:13.042
ACTUALLY, I WAS JUST
THINKING ABOUT MY MOTHER...

26:14.874 --> 26:16.776
AND HOW INSIGHTFUL SHE WAS.

26:16.776 --> 26:19.148
INSIGHTFUL ABOUT WHAT?

26:19.148 --> 26:21.651
I'LL BE RIGHT ALONG.

26:21.651 --> 26:25.014
I JUST WANT TO, UH...

26:25.014 --> 26:26.956
TIDY UP FIRST.

26:29.058 --> 26:31.791
OKAY.

26:31.791 --> 26:33.993
OH, AND, REX?

26:33.993 --> 26:37.727
I'LL BE SERVING BELGIAN WAFFLES
FOR BREAKFAST.

26:38.998 --> 26:42.301
WOW.

26:42.301 --> 26:44.133
THEY'RE MY FAVORITE.

26:44.133 --> 26:46.636
MM.

26:49.278 --> 26:51.040
SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING.

26:51.040 --> 26:52.982
IT'S QUITE ALL RIGHT.

26:54.043 --> 26:56.015
ALTHOUGH I'M STILL
A LITTLE UNCLEAR

26:56.015 --> 26:58.347
AS TO WHY
YOU BROUGHT ME HERE.

26:58.347 --> 27:01.290
HAVE YOU EVER MET A MAN
BY THE NAME OF RAMON SANCHEZ?

27:01.290 --> 27:03.923
NO, I DON'T BELIEVE I HAVE.

27:03.923 --> 27:05.094
WHY?

27:05.094 --> 27:07.697
HE DISAPPEARED FROM HIS HOME
A FEW MONTHS AGO.

27:07.697 --> 27:10.259
AND WE JUST GOT A TIP

27:10.259 --> 27:11.961
THAT HE'S DEAD.

27:11.961 --> 27:13.703
OH, MY.

27:14.734 --> 27:16.635
YOU SAY YOU NEVER MET HIM?

27:16.635 --> 27:20.109
RAMON SANCHEZ. NO, THAT NAME
DOESN'T RING A BELL.

27:20.109 --> 27:21.811
WELL, YOU SEE,
BECAUSE OF THIS TIP,

27:21.811 --> 27:26.145
SOMEONE OUT THERE IS ACCUSING
YOU OF KILLING MR. SANCHEZ.

27:26.145 --> 27:29.148
OH, GOOD HEAVENS.
THAT'S JUST SILLY.

27:29.148 --> 27:31.120
AND AS IT HAPPENS,

27:31.120 --> 27:34.754
MR. SANCHEZ WAS FOUND
 EXACTLY

27:34.754 --> 27:36.856
WHERE THE TIPSTER SAID
HE WOULD BE.

27:36.856 --> 27:38.327
AND WAS HE--

27:38.327 --> 27:39.729
DEAD?

27:39.729 --> 27:40.990
YES, MA'AM.

27:40.990 --> 27:43.833
(sighs) WHAT A SHAME.

27:43.833 --> 27:47.296
BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED
AS MR. SANCHEZ'S KILLER--

27:47.296 --> 27:49.338
YOU HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO
BRING ME IN FOR QUESTIONING.

27:49.338 --> 27:51.000
I UNDERSTAND.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.772
SO I HAVE TO ASK YOU...

27:52.772 --> 27:54.073
(sets mug down)

27:54.073 --> 27:55.945
DID YOU KILL HIM?

27:58.677 --> 28:00.850
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

28:06.085 --> 28:08.718
I MUST SAY,
YOU ARE HARD TO READ.

28:08.718 --> 28:10.319
THANK YOU.
WHAT A LOVELY COMPLIMENT.

28:10.319 --> 28:13.262
YOU THINK
THAT'S A COMPLIMENT?

28:13.262 --> 28:15.194
I WAS RAISED TO BE COMPOSED
AT ALL TIMES.

28:15.194 --> 28:18.697
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY
A VERY STRESSFUL SITUATION--

28:18.697 --> 28:22.101
FINDING MYSELF ACCUSED
OF A HORRIFIC CRIME.

28:22.101 --> 28:23.702
AND THE FACT
THAT YOU WOULD THINK

28:23.702 --> 28:25.234
THAT I'M COMPORTING MYSELF

28:25.234 --> 28:28.107
WITH A MEASURE OF GRACE
AND DIGNITY--

28:28.107 --> 28:31.240
WELL, THAT'S A THOUGHTFUL THING
TO SAY. YOU'RE VERY SWEET.

28:31.240 --> 28:33.712
NOW DO YOU HAVE
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS?

28:33.712 --> 28:35.144
I HATE TO RUSH YOU,

28:35.144 --> 28:38.788
BUT I'M LATE FOR THE FUNERAL
OF A VERY DEAR FRIEND.

28:38.788 --> 28:40.890
HMM.

28:40.890 --> 28:43.152
I CAN'T THINK OF A THING.

28:48.397 --> 28:51.000
WELL, IT WAS LOVELY
MEETING YOU,

28:51.000 --> 28:54.303
AND I DO HOPE YOU FIND OUT
WHAT HAPPENED TO MR. SANCHEZ.

28:54.303 --> 28:56.165
I'M SURE WE WILL.

29:02.511 --> 29:04.914
SEE? WHAT DID I TELL YOU?

29:04.914 --> 29:07.016
SHE'S SOMETHING ALL RIGHT.

29:07.016 --> 29:09.979
I'M JUST NOT SURE WHAT WE GOT
BY BRINGING HER DOWN HERE.

29:13.452 --> 29:16.255
WE GOT HER FINGERPRINTS.

29:21.791 --> 29:22.962
(man, amplified voice)
"I AM THE RESURRECTION

29:22.962 --> 29:24.293
AND THE LIFE..."
 AS SUSAN LISTENED

29:24.293 --> 29:27.296
TO THE KIND WORDS THE MINISTER
HAD TO SAY ABOUT MIKE,

29:27.296 --> 29:29.999
SHE FOUND HERSELF AT A LOSS.

29:29.999 --> 29:33.973
SHE KNEW PEOPLE WANTED
TO HEAR FROM HER,

29:33.973 --> 29:38.377
BUT SHE HAD NO IDEA
WHAT SHE WANTED TO SAY.

29:38.377 --> 29:40.349
(both laugh)

29:40.349 --> 29:42.181
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE MAKING ME DO THIS.

29:42.181 --> 29:45.114
OH, WAIT. I THINK
WHAT YOU MEAN TO SAY IS,

29:45.114 --> 29:49.018
"SUSAN,
SWEET, WONDERFUL SUSAN,

29:49.018 --> 29:51.991
"THANK YOU FOR MARRYING ME
AND ALLOWING ME THE HONOR

29:51.991 --> 29:56.325
OF CARRYING YOUR BEAUTIFUL
BEHIND INSIDE OUR HOUSE."

29:56.325 --> 29:58.097
YOU ARE SO DRUNK RIGHT NOW.

29:58.097 --> 30:00.930
NO, I AM NOT. I'M JUST--

30:00.930 --> 30:03.372
OH, I'VE NEVER BEEN
THIS HAPPY IN MY LIFE.

30:03.372 --> 30:05.474
(groans)
 I FEEL LIKE I COULD FLOAT.

30:05.474 --> 30:07.076
(strained voice)
I WISH YOU COULD.

30:07.076 --> 30:08.077
AAH! (laughs)

30:08.077 --> 30:10.509
(laughs) OH.

30:10.509 --> 30:14.043
YEAH, I'M HAPPY, TOO.

30:14.043 --> 30:15.414
THAT'S IT?

30:15.414 --> 30:16.916
"I'M HAPPY"?

30:16.916 --> 30:19.518
WELL, THAT COVERS IT.

30:19.518 --> 30:23.422
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?
I'M NOT A BIG... WORD GUY.

30:23.422 --> 30:26.225
OKAY. COME ON, MISTER...

30:26.225 --> 30:28.157
STRONG AND SILENT.

30:30.029 --> 30:31.000
WHAT?

30:31.000 --> 30:33.102
WRITE ME A POEM.

30:33.102 --> 30:34.904
OH, LEAVE ME ALONE
WITH THIS STUFF.

30:34.904 --> 30:38.137
IT'S MY WEDDING NIGHT,
AND I WANT A POEM.

30:38.137 --> 30:41.140
COME ON. LET'S GO.

30:41.140 --> 30:44.243
ALL I REMEMBER IS THIS THING
FROM WHEN I WAS A KID.

30:44.243 --> 30:45.945
I'LL TAKE IT.

30:45.945 --> 30:47.977
GIVE ME MY POEM, HUSBAND.
(laughs)

30:47.977 --> 30:49.478
(chuckles)

30:49.478 --> 30:50.920
(clears throat)

30:50.920 --> 30:53.122
I LOVE YOU ONCE.

30:53.122 --> 30:55.124
I LOVE YOU TWICE.

30:55.124 --> 30:57.586
I LOVE YOU MORE
THAN BEANS AND RICE.

30:57.586 --> 31:01.030
(laughs) OH.

31:01.030 --> 31:04.263
NOW THAT IS A POEM. OH.

31:08.867 --> 31:10.339
IT'S REALLY SMART
YOU GUYS ARE DOING THIS.

31:10.339 --> 31:13.973
WHEN PEOPLE DIE WITHOUT A WILL,
IT CAN BE A NIGHTMARE.

31:15.905 --> 31:17.106
YOU OKAY, HONEY?

31:17.106 --> 31:19.348
OF COURSE I'M OKAY.

31:19.348 --> 31:22.051
WE'RE ABOUT TO TALK
ABOUT US DYING

31:22.051 --> 31:24.113
FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS.

31:24.113 --> 31:27.256
IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL ANY BETTER,
NOBODY ENJOYS THIS.

31:27.256 --> 31:29.088
I'M SHOCKED TO HEAR THAT.

31:29.088 --> 31:30.659
YOU GOT ANY CANCER PAMPHLETS
IN THERE?

31:30.659 --> 31:32.221
IN CASE WE FINISH EARLY.

31:32.221 --> 31:34.193
SUSAN, COME ON.
THIS IS IMPORTANT.

31:34.193 --> 31:36.065
WE GOT THE BABY COMING.
WE GOT THE HOUSE.

31:36.065 --> 31:37.927
I'M NOT SAYING
A WILL ISN'T IMPORTANT.

31:37.927 --> 31:40.930
I'M SAYING
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY.

31:40.930 --> 31:42.501
WE SHOULD TAKE A WALK
OR SOMETHING

31:42.501 --> 31:45.274
AND DEAL WITH
THIS DYING STUFF...

31:45.274 --> 31:48.107
ON A NICE, DREARY,
RAINY DAY.

31:48.107 --> 31:51.610
UM, BATHROOM'S RIGHT THERE, BOB.

31:51.610 --> 31:53.082
I DON'T NEED
TO USE THE BATHROOM.

31:54.183 --> 31:56.986
OR MAYBE I DO.

31:58.617 --> 32:01.090
(sighs)

32:01.090 --> 32:03.022
OKAY. WHAT IS IT?

32:03.022 --> 32:05.924
(sighs) WE'RE JINXING US.

32:05.924 --> 32:09.258
BY DOING THIS, WE'RE TELLING
DEATH, "COME ON IN."

32:09.258 --> 32:12.231
NO, IT'S WHEN YOU DON'T DO THIS
THAT IT'S A JINX.

32:12.231 --> 32:14.263
LOOK, I'M A PLUMBER,
AND IT'S ALWAYS

32:14.263 --> 32:15.965
THE PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE
HOMEOWNER'S INSURANCE

32:15.965 --> 32:17.566
WHOSE TOILETS EXPLODE.

32:17.566 --> 32:20.039
IS IT WHAT THEY EAT?

32:20.039 --> 32:22.171
MISSING MY POINT.

32:22.171 --> 32:24.443
NO, AVOIDING YOUR POINT.

32:24.443 --> 32:25.474
GO WASH YOUR HANDS.

32:28.077 --> 32:29.118
PLEASE?

32:29.118 --> 32:31.280
WE'LL DO IT SATURDAY.
I PROMISE.

32:31.280 --> 32:35.954
LOOK, I KNOW IT'S TOUGH,
BUT INDULGE ME, OKAY?

32:35.954 --> 32:38.227
BECAUSE IF SOMETHING HAPPENS,

32:38.227 --> 32:40.089
THERE'S NOTHING
MORE IMPORTANT TO ME

32:40.089 --> 32:42.161
THAN KNOWING THAT YOU
AND YOU...

32:43.492 --> 32:45.964
ARE TAKEN CARE OF.

32:50.239 --> 32:51.600
BOB, COME ON!

32:51.600 --> 32:55.344
WE'RE NOT PAYING YOU
TO GO TO THE BATHROOM.

32:57.346 --> 32:59.508
OH, THIS IS
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

32:59.508 --> 33:02.381
NONE OF THAT KOBE BEEF, ARUGULA,
AND GOAT CHEESE NONSENSE.

33:02.381 --> 33:04.183
GIVE ME GOOD OLD-FASHIONED
GROUND BEEF,

33:04.183 --> 33:07.286
AMERICAN CHEESE,
AND ICEBERG LETTUCE ANY DAY.

33:07.286 --> 33:09.218
WELL, I AM GLAD YOU'RE HAPPY,

33:09.218 --> 33:11.090
BUT I AM NOT SURE
THAT ANY BURGER IS

33:11.090 --> 33:12.991
WORTH A HALF-HOUR DRIVE
IN THE CAR.

33:12.991 --> 33:15.364
THAT'S JUST 'CAUSE
YOU HAVEN'T TAKEN A BITE YET.

33:15.364 --> 33:19.998
JUANITA SAID MRS. VAN DE KAMP'S
BOYFRIEND GOT KILLED BY A CAR.

33:19.998 --> 33:22.201
UH, YES.

33:22.201 --> 33:24.002
YES, HE DID.

33:24.002 --> 33:25.204
UM...

33:25.204 --> 33:26.775
AND IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

33:26.775 --> 33:28.177
IT WAS VERY SAD.

33:28.177 --> 33:29.678
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY.

33:29.678 --> 33:31.710
AS LONG AS WE REMEMBER
TO LOOK BOTH WAYS

33:31.710 --> 33:34.213
BEFORE WE CROSS THE STREET,
THAT'LL NEVER HAPPEN TO US.

33:36.545 --> 33:38.347
WHERE DO WE GO WHEN WE DIE?

33:43.222 --> 33:45.694
(mouth full) WELL, YOU KNOW,
WE GO TO HEAVEN.

33:45.694 --> 33:48.257
I KNOW,
BUT DOES EVERYONE GO?

33:50.429 --> 33:53.262
EVERYONE YOU KNOW
WILL GO TO HEAVEN.

33:53.262 --> 33:57.166
WHAT ABOUT ANIMALS?

33:57.166 --> 33:59.068
ANIMALS GO TO HEAVEN, TOO.

33:59.068 --> 34:01.510
WHAT ABOUT BUGS?

34:01.510 --> 34:03.812
BUGS ARE ANNOYING.

34:03.812 --> 34:05.744
WE DON'T WANT BUGS IN HEAVEN.

34:05.744 --> 34:08.117
WHAT ABOUT THE ANIMALS
THAT EAT THE BUGS?

34:08.117 --> 34:09.378
WON'T THEY STARVE?

34:11.080 --> 34:12.420
YOU'RE RIGHT.

34:12.420 --> 34:14.223
THERE ARE BUGS IN HEAVEN.

34:14.223 --> 34:16.685
BUT IF ALL THE PEOPLE
AND ALL THE ANIMALS

34:16.685 --> 34:19.358
AND ALL THE BUGS THAT EVER LIVED
GO TO HEAVEN,

34:19.358 --> 34:21.290
ISN'T IT SUPER CROWDED?

34:21.290 --> 34:23.232
NO, SWEETIE.

34:23.232 --> 34:25.293
HEAVEN IS PERFECT.

34:25.293 --> 34:28.337
HOW IS IT PERFECT?
I MEAN, WHAT'S IT LIKE?

34:28.337 --> 34:30.539
YOU WANNA JUMP IN HERE?

34:32.641 --> 34:35.304
(mouth full) BUDDY,
THIS IS HEAVEN.

34:35.304 --> 34:37.446
IT IS?

34:37.446 --> 34:39.248
SURE. SITTING WITH THE PEOPLE

34:39.248 --> 34:41.810
YOU LOVE MORE THAN
ANYTHING IN THE WORLD,

34:41.810 --> 34:44.483
EATING A DOUBLE CHEESEBURGER
AND FRIES--IT'S GOTTA BE HEAVEN.

34:46.083 --> 34:48.317
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS HEAVEN?
 WHAT?

34:48.317 --> 34:49.358
THAT PLACE WE FISH.

34:49.358 --> 34:50.458
NEAR THE WATERFALL?

34:50.458 --> 34:51.760
YEP. HEAVEN.

34:51.760 --> 34:53.492
AND WHEN WE WATCH FOOTBALL
TOGETHER

34:53.492 --> 34:55.793
AND MOM BRINGS US
TRAYS OF SNACKS.

34:55.793 --> 34:57.396
THAT'S HEAVEN, TOO?

34:57.396 --> 34:59.268
IF HEAVEN IS SUPPOSED TO BE
THE HAPPIEST PLACE YOU CAN BE,

34:59.268 --> 35:01.330
DON'T ALL THOSE PLACES
SOUND LIKE IT TO YOU?

35:07.276 --> 35:08.607
(mouth full) WHAT ARE HAMBURGERS
MADE OUT OF?

35:08.607 --> 35:10.209
'CAUSE I KNOW THEY'RE NOT HAM.

35:10.209 --> 35:11.480
(chuckles)

35:14.843 --> 35:16.745
(amplified voice)
THANK YOU FOR COMING

35:16.745 --> 35:19.818
TO HELP HONOR
MIKE DELFINO'S LIFE.

35:19.818 --> 35:23.692
THE FAMILY INVITES YOU
TO JOIN THEM AT THE CEMETERY.

35:23.692 --> 35:25.154
UH...

35:26.395 --> 35:29.127
I CHANGED MY MIND.

35:29.127 --> 35:30.699
(amplified voice) HI.

35:30.699 --> 35:33.862
I-I WASN'T, UH,
PLANNING TO SAY ANYTHING

35:33.862 --> 35:37.506
BECAUSE, UH...

35:37.506 --> 35:41.410
I HAD ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA
WHAT TO SAY.

35:41.410 --> 35:45.244
MIKE AND I NEVER TALKED ABOUT

35:45.244 --> 35:47.346
WHAT HE WANTED FOR A FUNERAL.

35:49.248 --> 35:52.681
I THINK IT'S BECAUSE, UM...

35:52.681 --> 35:54.483
WELL, YOU KNOW MIKE.

35:54.483 --> 35:58.257
HE... WASN'T REALLY
MUCH OF A TALKER.

35:59.458 --> 36:01.460
SOME OF YOU,

36:01.460 --> 36:05.364
AS YOU CAME BY TO HUG ME TODAY,

36:05.364 --> 36:08.397
YOU SAID THAT
HE'S IN A BETTER PLACE.

36:10.499 --> 36:13.472
AND YOU KNOW WHAT? I...

36:13.472 --> 36:16.775
I REALIZE NOW...

36:16.775 --> 36:18.777
HE IS.

36:20.549 --> 36:24.413
HE... IS IN A DINER...

36:26.455 --> 36:30.359
EATING CHEESEBURGERS
WITH HIS FAMILY...

36:32.621 --> 36:34.863
AND HE'S FISHING

36:34.863 --> 36:36.765
AT A WATERFALL...

36:40.329 --> 36:43.502
AND HE'S WATCHING FOOTBALL
WITH HIS SON,

36:43.502 --> 36:46.505
YELLING LIKE A MANIAC.

36:46.505 --> 36:49.207
SO...

36:49.207 --> 36:54.212
SINCE HE HAS TO BE IN...

36:54.212 --> 36:56.545
ALL THOSE WONDERFUL PLACES...

37:00.389 --> 37:04.753
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO SAY
GOOD-BYE TO HIM NOW.

37:11.600 --> 37:14.833
GOOD-BYE, MIKE.

37:19.268 --> 37:28.377
(sniffles)

37:28.377 --> 37:30.719
I LOVE YOU ONCE.

37:30.719 --> 37:33.622
I LOVE YOU TWICE.

37:33.622 --> 37:36.525
OH.

37:36.525 --> 37:39.257
(whispers) I LOVE YOU MORE
THAN BEANS AND RICE.

THIS WAS THE BEST FREAKING
BURGER I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE.

40:13.682 --> 40:14.943
YOU GOT THAT RIGHT.

40:18.116 --> 40:21.419
SUSAN, YOU HAVEN'T EATEN
A THING. AREN'T YOU STARVING?

40:23.021 --> 40:26.755
0-5-1-6-0-2.

40:28.426 --> 40:30.929
I-I JUST REMEMBERED--

40:30.929 --> 40:32.901
IT'S MIKE'S PASSWORD
FOR HIS VOICE MAIL.

40:32.901 --> 40:35.504
I HAVE TO CALL
THE CELL PHONE COMPANY,

40:35.504 --> 40:37.866
OR THEY'RE GONNA CHARGE US
FOR AN EXTRA MONTH.

40:37.866 --> 40:39.738
I CAN DO THAT FOR YOU.

40:39.738 --> 40:41.940
I WILL CALL THEM
FIRST THING TOMORROW MORNING.

40:46.575 --> 40:49.878
M.J. SIGNED... UP

40:49.878 --> 40:53.021
FOR PITCHING
FOR LITTLE LEAGUE THIS YEAR.

40:53.021 --> 40:54.923
MIKE WAS SUPPOSED TO TEACH HIM.

40:54.923 --> 40:57.486
OH, HONEY, I'LL SEND CARLOS OVER
TO COACH HIM.

40:57.486 --> 41:00.158
I GAVE HIM TWO GIRLS WHO HATE
SPORTS, SO HE'LL BE THRILLED.

41:00.158 --> 41:03.091
(voice breaking) MIKE WAS ALWAYS
CHECKING THE TIRES ON OUR CAR

41:03.091 --> 41:04.893
WITH THIS THINGY.

41:06.835 --> 41:09.498
(crying) I DON'T KNOW
WHERE THE THINGY IS.

41:09.498 --> 41:12.741
I JUST KNOW IT WAS IMPORTANT
AND IT KEPT US SAFE.

41:12.741 --> 41:15.574
HEY. HEY. TOM'S STILL
TAKING CARE OF OUR CARS.

41:15.574 --> 41:19.107
I'LL JUST TELL HIM TO ADD YOURS
TO HIS TO-DO LIST FROM NOW ON.

41:19.107 --> 41:20.979
(sniffles)

41:20.979 --> 41:23.552
OH.

41:23.552 --> 41:27.055
SUSAN, WE ARE GONNA DO
EVERYTHING WE CAN

41:27.055 --> 41:28.617
TO HOLD YOU UP, OKAY?

41:28.617 --> 41:31.089
(sniffles) OKAY.

41:31.089 --> 41:35.063
YES, AS MUCH AS DEATH
TAKES FROM US,

41:35.063 --> 41:37.225
IT ALSO GIVES.

41:37.225 --> 41:40.999
IT TEACHES US
WHAT'S TRULY IMPORTANT...

41:42.971 --> 41:47.876
LIKE GIVING BACK
AFTER A LIFETIME OF TAKING...

41:49.978 --> 41:52.180
GOING AFTER SOMETHING

41:52.180 --> 41:55.113
WE NEVER
SHOULD HAVE LET GO OF...

42:00.088 --> 42:04.953
OR LOOKING BACK
ON WHAT MADE US WHO WE ARE.

42:07.896 --> 42:13.531
BUT SOMETIMES THE LESSONS
LEARNED AFTER A PERSON'S DEATH

42:13.531 --> 42:16.534
AREN'T THE ONES WE EXPECTED.

42:16.534 --> 42:17.966
FORENSICS SAYS
THE PRINTS ON THE MUG

42:17.966 --> 42:20.138
MATCH THE PRINTS WE FOUND
ON THE DEAD GUY.

42:20.138 --> 42:24.112
WHOLE TIME SHE WAS DATING CHUCK,
I NEVER TRUSTED HER.

42:24.112 --> 42:26.274
YOU THINK WE GOT ENOUGH
TO ARREST HER?

42:26.274 --> 42:27.946
PROBABLY.

42:27.946 --> 42:29.317
LET'S HOLD OFF.

42:29.317 --> 42:32.921
I WANNA MAKE SURE WE GET ENOUGH
TO PUT THIS BITCH AWAY FOR GOOD.
