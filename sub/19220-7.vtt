WEBVTT

00:04.680 --> 00:06.800
Let the fun commence.

00:08.800 --> 00:10.480
'Ex on the Beach is back.'

00:14.000 --> 00:17.280
'Eight new unsuspecting singles
are looking for love.'

00:18.360 --> 00:21.240
'But what they don't know is...'
Fuck.

00:21.320 --> 00:25.240
'...there are more exes
than ever before.'

00:25.320 --> 00:28.000
My arse just fell out me shorts.
You cheated on me!

00:28.080 --> 00:30.040
Stop acting the fucking big man!

00:30.120 --> 00:33.000
You are my best friend
and I wouldn't do that to you!

00:33.080 --> 00:36.920
'And they're flying in
from everywhere.'

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
(shouting, laughter)

00:41.480 --> 00:44.320
'Some exes want romance.'

00:44.400 --> 00:46.000
I do really, really love him.

00:47.400 --> 00:48.640
'Some want revenge.'

00:48.720 --> 00:51.080
(screaming)
Both of you, let go now!

00:51.160 --> 00:52.480
Let go now!

00:52.560 --> 00:54.680
No one fucking likes you!
See you later.

00:54.760 --> 00:57.840
'And others just want
to wreck the gaff.'

00:59.080 --> 01:00.680
Hey!
(clattering)

01:00.760 --> 01:03.920
Fuck! That'll be someone's
fucking head in a minute.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.440
'As always, the Tablet of Terror
is topping up the torment...'

01:07.520 --> 01:10.520
It's going to be fireworks.
'...causing misery...'

01:10.600 --> 01:12.160
(sobs)
What am I going to do?

01:12.240 --> 01:14.320
You will never ever have me
ever again.

01:14.400 --> 01:16.560
'...mayhem...'
You fucking dickhead!

01:16.640 --> 01:19.640
(shouting)
'...and madness.'

01:19.720 --> 01:23.560
Oh!
'It's going to get explosive.'

01:23.640 --> 01:25.160
Fucking what?!
Ooh!

01:25.240 --> 01:28.160
(shouting)
Fucking slag!

01:28.240 --> 01:31.200
'Eight exes have already arrived.
But...'

01:32.000 --> 01:35.120
I hate her guts.
Slag, slag, slag, slag, slag.

01:40.720 --> 01:42.640
My heart is breaking.

01:59.520 --> 02:01.320
(thunder crashes)

02:06.080 --> 02:07.760
(thunder crashes)

02:09.000 --> 02:11.680
I'm probably the happiest
I've been in the villa.

02:11.760 --> 02:14.400
I feel like me and Ross
are really strong.

02:14.480 --> 02:16.560
Even if there is shit
coming our way,

02:16.640 --> 02:18.720
I think we could
deal with it together.

02:18.800 --> 02:21.080
It feels, like, special.

02:23.400 --> 02:25.200
Harriette thinks I'm in 100%.

02:25.280 --> 02:28.640
Being honest, she's the best
in there for me, at the moment.

02:30.440 --> 02:33.360
After Adam accusing me of sleeping
with another girl,

02:33.440 --> 02:35.320
me and Nicole, we've got past this

02:35.400 --> 02:37.800
and we're going
in the right direction.

02:41.360 --> 02:43.760
Me and Jacques Fraser made up
by having sex,

02:43.840 --> 02:47.000
so, yeah, ten out of ten.
Blinding night.

02:54.560 --> 02:57.000
Last night, I chose Jack
to go to the penthouse

02:57.080 --> 02:59.440
cos I've been trying to move forward.

02:59.520 --> 03:01.120
If I chose Aaron,

03:01.200 --> 03:04.960
I know for a fact
we would've ended up just arguing.

03:05.040 --> 03:07.120
It was exciting to sit on his face.

03:10.800 --> 03:12.720
Thank fuck for that.

03:12.800 --> 03:15.640
I knew I was getting my end away.

03:15.720 --> 03:17.160
Emptied the load.

03:18.720 --> 03:21.960
I've seen how Aaron's acted
since Becca's been in the villa.

03:23.800 --> 03:26.840
I've just decided
enough's just enough.

03:27.840 --> 03:30.120
If Becca and Aaron shagged,
it's not nice.

03:30.200 --> 03:32.160
I'm not second best to anyone,

03:32.240 --> 03:35.960
so it'll be interesting to see,
when they come down the stairs,

03:36.040 --> 03:37.800
what they've got to say.

03:39.200 --> 03:41.080
Morning.
What's happening?

03:41.160 --> 03:43.760
What's happening?
You all right?

03:43.840 --> 03:45.480
You both look fresh.

03:45.560 --> 03:47.280
Becca can't even look at us.

03:47.360 --> 03:50.360
Did you romp? Yes or no?

03:53.000 --> 03:54.760
What's your input, Becca?

03:54.840 --> 03:57.080
(whispers) Fuck off, for fuck's sake.

03:58.080 --> 04:01.600
Obviously, she's the only bird
I'm attracted to in here.

04:01.680 --> 04:04.960
Think I'm going
to play chess with her?

04:05.040 --> 04:08.160
Now that is the biggest
kick in the balls I have ever had.

04:08.240 --> 04:12.960
Don't look over the table and say,
"You're not cracking on with Aaron."

04:13.040 --> 04:17.200
Last night, Becca has a go at us
and she goes and gets shagged.

04:17.279 --> 04:19.720
That is a disrespectful little girl.

04:19.800 --> 04:21.920
The was the final nail
in the coffin.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.880
You've done wrong, you arsehole.

04:23.960 --> 04:25.960
Fuck you, you fucking divvy.

04:27.480 --> 04:28.880
Becca has a dirty arse?

04:28.960 --> 04:31.560
How can you sit
across the table from someone

04:31.640 --> 04:34.680
How can you go,
"Don't fucking dare kiss him."

04:34.760 --> 04:38.480
What's it got to do with you?
I didn't say fucking don't dare.

04:38.560 --> 04:41.000
You went, "You're my best mate."
Yes, you did.

04:41.080 --> 04:43.200
I couldn't give a fuck.
I got my end away.

04:43.280 --> 04:44.920
That's all I give a shit about.

04:45.000 --> 04:46.600
She's just a fucking bang.

04:46.680 --> 04:49.840
You talk shit.
Don't you dare sit and go...

04:49.920 --> 04:52.840
All right! How many times
do you want to fucking say it?!

04:52.920 --> 04:55.120
You idiot!
What are you shouting for?

04:55.200 --> 04:57.480
I'm allowed to say
what I fucking want!

04:57.560 --> 05:00.880
Because all you fucking do
is fucking repeat the same shite.

05:00.960 --> 05:03.720
I love this. This is my honest face.
I am loving this.

05:03.800 --> 05:06.320
Go and sit down then.
I like standing up.

05:06.400 --> 05:08.400
I'm comfortable standing here.

05:08.480 --> 05:10.800
You're a liar.
That's why you're shouting.

05:10.880 --> 05:12.720
You can't handle what you've done.

05:12.800 --> 05:14.480
You talk shit, Becca.

05:14.560 --> 05:16.360
What the fuck are you on about?

05:16.440 --> 05:18.480
You will see. You will see.

05:18.560 --> 05:20.840
You're going to set me
fucking off again!

05:22.240 --> 05:24.320
(clanging)

05:27.280 --> 05:28.480
(chuckles)

05:28.560 --> 05:32.560
On my family's life, my mum's life,
I will never speak to that girl.

05:33.600 --> 05:36.360
Becca has not got
a fucking leg to stand on.

05:37.360 --> 05:40.920
She doesn't want me, but she doesn't
want me to have anyone else.

05:41.920 --> 05:43.360
Aaron is not over Becca

05:43.440 --> 05:46.480
and I'm not being a third piece
in this fucked-up jigsaw.

05:46.560 --> 05:48.800
I don't know
where she's coming from.

05:49.920 --> 05:52.280
You've made your bed, so lie in it.

05:52.360 --> 05:55.160
Hopefully, you'll never get up.
I take that back.

05:55.240 --> 05:59.400
He's doing whatever he wants
with ZaraLena. Is he fucking off it?

05:59.480 --> 06:02.480
Aaron and ZaraLena
fancy each other like fuck.

06:03.600 --> 06:05.280
Everyone forgets that as well!

06:05.360 --> 06:08.840
Everyone's looking at me
like I'm some cunt. Fucking hell.

06:08.920 --> 06:10.280
(laughs) Whoa.

06:11.320 --> 06:13.160
Fucking joke.

06:13.240 --> 06:15.520
Why the fuck?
I don't fucking understand.

06:15.600 --> 06:18.200
Honestly. Whatever.

06:18.280 --> 06:20.840
She's like a big, massive,
screaming rhino.

06:20.920 --> 06:23.960
No-one fucking says,
"This is how you must feel today."

06:24.040 --> 06:27.040
"This is how you must feel tomorrow,
when you're drunk."

06:27.120 --> 06:29.360
"This is how..." Fucking fuck off.

06:29.440 --> 06:32.280
I'm not allowed
to have different feelings?

06:32.360 --> 06:34.040
Yes, I fucking am!

06:39.840 --> 06:40.880
Thanks.

06:43.160 --> 06:44.800
'With Becca losing her mind,

06:44.880 --> 06:49.680
who else will be going batshit crazy
when the next ex arrives?'

06:49.760 --> 06:53.080
'Whose ex is next?'

07:03.680 --> 07:05.560
(tablet chimes)

07:05.640 --> 07:07.520
For fuck's sake.

07:07.600 --> 07:10.120
What does it have in store
for us today?

07:10.200 --> 07:12.280
"After a heated morning
in the villa,

07:12.360 --> 07:14.080
it's time to hit it hard."

07:14.160 --> 07:16.960
"You're having a boat party."
Yes, come on!

07:17.040 --> 07:18.880
(they cheer)

07:21.320 --> 07:23.520
Let's go and fucking party!

08:00.160 --> 08:01.440
Everyone's jumping in.

08:01.520 --> 08:05.160
I want to chuck Zara in a speedboat
and send her back to shore.

08:05.240 --> 08:07.560
She's not getting involved,
the bore.

08:07.640 --> 08:10.800
'While Zara is all alone,
looking lost at sea,

08:10.880 --> 08:15.160
some of the other girls seem
to be falling hook, line and sinker.'

08:16.840 --> 08:18.520
Where are you with Ross now?

08:18.600 --> 08:20.960
I feel like there is a future
for me and Ross.

08:21.040 --> 08:23.600
Harriette and Ross,
on, off, on, off.

08:23.680 --> 08:25.680
Snooze fest. I'm bored of it.

08:27.320 --> 08:30.360
Nicole, what's going on
with you and Jacques now?

08:30.440 --> 08:32.960
Just said we're going to see
how things go.

08:33.039 --> 08:35.480
I don't believe in
the cheating rumours.

08:35.559 --> 08:38.799
I love him to pieces,
so I do regret ever doubting him

08:38.880 --> 08:41.919
cos I feel like I should have
had his back like he has mine.

08:42.000 --> 08:44.440
Are you getting back together?

08:44.520 --> 08:46.760
He hasn't said,
will I be his girlfriend?

08:46.840 --> 08:50.320
We have cleared the air
and we're letting things go slowly.

08:50.400 --> 08:53.080
I do think
he's such a genuine guy as well.

08:53.160 --> 08:56.800
I normally can see through, sort of,
if somebody's lying.

08:56.880 --> 09:00.120
I don't trust him at all.
I feel like he's lying to her.

09:08.960 --> 09:10.400
Is this person a cunt?

09:11.400 --> 09:13.360
(all agree)
Aaron!

09:13.440 --> 09:15.120
(they laugh)

09:17.640 --> 09:19.960
Aaron's clearly got feelings
with Becca

09:20.040 --> 09:22.080
and I feel like piggy in the middle.

09:22.160 --> 09:24.960
So, I need to get myself out
of this situation.

09:25.040 --> 09:27.280
I just think it's time that I left.

09:30.200 --> 09:33.320
I've made the decision
that I will go tonight.

09:33.400 --> 09:34.640
(bell tolls)

09:38.160 --> 09:39.840
No-one's arsed.

09:41.880 --> 09:44.400
Me and Zara haven't
had a proper chat.

09:44.480 --> 09:46.360
We need to talk before she goes.

09:46.440 --> 09:48.840
The thing is,
I'm not going to make you stay.

09:48.920 --> 09:51.640
I want you to stay,
but I'm not going to make you.

09:51.720 --> 09:54.000
It's making me unhappy.
There's no point.

09:54.080 --> 09:57.640
I'm ready to go and it doesn't mean
I don't like you or anything.

09:57.720 --> 10:00.240
So you know how I feel about you.
I do like you.

10:00.320 --> 10:02.880
Obviously,
see if we speak after here and then

10:02.960 --> 10:06.880
you have a good time and I'll
go home and cuddle my dog. (laughs)

10:06.960 --> 10:08.960
Yeah?
Quick kiss.

10:09.040 --> 10:11.360
Zara's leaving.
That means I'm single.

10:11.440 --> 10:13.720
So, believe me,
I've got one job to do

10:13.800 --> 10:17.720
and that is fucking mug Becca off
as much as I can.

10:17.800 --> 10:20.240
She's chose to leave
and I respect that.

10:20.320 --> 10:23.080
I'm going to miss ZaraLena so much
because...

10:25.440 --> 10:27.200
(indistinct conversation)

10:28.520 --> 10:30.360
Nah, I'm not going to miss her.

10:30.440 --> 10:33.280
You get why I'm going.
Yeah, of course I do.

10:33.360 --> 10:34.680
I'll see you later.
Bye.

10:34.760 --> 10:36.360
Bye, fuckers.

10:42.720 --> 10:45.760
ZaraLena's got a face
like a slapped arse.

10:46.840 --> 10:50.400
Zara's stat there with that awkward
smile that she does all day.

11:01.520 --> 11:02.960
She has good morals.

11:05.440 --> 11:07.720
She's drier than Gandhi's flip-flop.

11:09.120 --> 11:10.160
Whatever.

11:15.680 --> 11:17.800
'After ZaraLena's emotional goodbye,

11:17.880 --> 11:21.040
it seems Harriette's trying
to hold on to what she's got.'

11:21.120 --> 11:22.680
I'm falling for you.

11:25.160 --> 11:27.160
I just don't know what to say.

11:27.240 --> 11:30.320
We've supported each other,
made each other laugh.

11:31.320 --> 11:34.320
And cry.
And cry. And angry.

11:34.400 --> 11:37.000
I have... I have grown to love you.

11:39.400 --> 11:41.360
(laughs)

11:41.440 --> 11:43.000
It's fucking awkward.

11:46.360 --> 11:49.440
I wanted him to give me
a bit more than a smile.

11:51.760 --> 11:54.440
He's messing with my emotions a bit.

11:56.240 --> 11:58.440
'Come on, Ross, grow some balls.'

11:58.520 --> 12:00.280
'Tell her how you really feel.'

12:03.160 --> 12:05.080
'Ah, you bottled it.'

12:05.160 --> 12:06.800
(chuckles)

12:10.280 --> 12:11.720
'With everyone in bed,

12:11.800 --> 12:15.880
let's see if Jacques Fraser can be
a bit more honest with his feelings.'

12:16.720 --> 12:18.360
What is it that you want?

12:18.440 --> 12:21.280
You know what I want.
Don't ask me what I want.

12:21.360 --> 12:23.680
I just need to know
where we both stand.

12:23.760 --> 12:25.800
Are we getting back together or?

12:25.880 --> 12:28.480
That's down to you.
Are you going to ask me that?

12:28.560 --> 12:30.360
I've come in here to get you back.

12:31.600 --> 12:33.200
I can't explain how I feel.

12:33.280 --> 12:35.480
You know when people say you find

12:35.560 --> 12:39.200
the one person of your lifetime
that is my soulmate.

12:39.280 --> 12:41.880
I had to deal
with the cheating allegations

12:41.960 --> 12:44.720
and you've said they're not true.
They're not true.

12:44.800 --> 12:46.640
It's a rumour, an allegation.

12:46.720 --> 12:50.520
Do you think I'd come in here
if that happened? Like, honestly?

12:50.600 --> 12:53.400
I do trust you, but I'm just saying,
don't let me down

12:53.480 --> 12:56.040
cos if you do let me down,
then you would be gone.

12:56.120 --> 12:57.920
That's not going to happen.

12:58.000 --> 13:01.920
Trust is a big thing. Thankfully,
she's believed what I'm telling her.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.280
So, we're basically together now.

13:04.360 --> 13:08.280
I'd like to think so, yeah.
OK.

13:12.080 --> 13:14.760
Nothing in this world
can tear us apart.

13:14.840 --> 13:16.880
I feel like
we're stronger than ever.

13:30.680 --> 13:34.560
For today, I hope that a couple
new birds come in, liven it up.

13:34.640 --> 13:38.920
I ain't come to get cooped up with
one bird and have a relationship.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.360
I'm still single
and I'm still at bat.

13:41.440 --> 13:43.400
I've woken up alone this morning.

13:43.480 --> 13:46.000
As much as me and Jack get on,
it'll never work.

13:47.000 --> 13:50.760
I'm just so upset because of how much
I've fucked things up with Aaron.

13:50.840 --> 13:52.560
I always put on this front,

13:52.640 --> 13:57.560
that I'm so strong and I don't love
him and this, that and the other.

13:57.640 --> 13:59.200
I do still love him.

13:59.280 --> 14:01.200
Me and Becca will never be anything.

14:01.280 --> 14:03.760
I don't have any feelings
for the girl at all.

14:03.840 --> 14:06.520
So, she might as well
walk around like a ghost

14:06.600 --> 14:08.480
cos I couldn't give a fuck.

14:08.560 --> 14:11.200
'Yeah, of course you couldn't,
Aaron.'

14:19.200 --> 14:20.800
I woke up with Nicole.

14:20.880 --> 14:21.960
Oh, my gosh.

14:22.040 --> 14:24.760
We've made it official
that we're back together.

14:24.840 --> 14:27.080
I feel like
I've got my best friend back.

14:27.160 --> 14:28.840
I'm cool. I'm good.

14:34.720 --> 14:36.200
Today, I feel a little lost.

14:38.520 --> 14:41.520
Harriette's falling for me.
I don't feel the same.

14:41.600 --> 14:44.520
I wanted a bit of fun,
but I'm not having any of the fun.

14:46.360 --> 14:48.560
'While Harriette enjoys a lie-in,

14:48.640 --> 14:51.000
the rest are about to get
a wake-up call.'

14:51.080 --> 14:52.800
(tablet chimes)

14:52.880 --> 14:54.120
(they groan)

14:54.200 --> 14:57.200
Fucking joking?
My chicken's fell out of my mouth.

14:57.280 --> 15:01.240
"Hey, gang, some of you could use
a little cooling down."

15:01.320 --> 15:04.800
"Rebecca and Ross...
you're off on a date."

15:04.880 --> 15:07.360
What?
(they laugh)

15:08.520 --> 15:10.320
Pretty excited about this date.

15:10.400 --> 15:11.840
She's hot.

15:14.920 --> 15:17.040
I'm glad that I'm with Ross
on this date.

15:17.120 --> 15:19.520
I'll be able to let my hair down,
have some fun

15:19.600 --> 15:22.200
and get away
from the Aaron situation.

15:24.400 --> 15:25.520
She can fuck off.

15:31.280 --> 15:34.360
Harriette's asleep and they
sneak off for a little date.

15:34.440 --> 15:36.800
Bye.
This ain't going to end well.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.480
'That's right.
There's no happy endings here,

15:40.560 --> 15:43.680
but whose ex will bring
more heartache and hatred?'

15:43.760 --> 15:46.800
'T minus four hours.'

15:46.880 --> 15:48.600
(maniacal laugh)

15:51.800 --> 15:53.520
(they chuckle)
Hello.

15:53.600 --> 15:56.840
Hello. I'm going to be your
paddle board yoga instructor.

15:56.920 --> 15:58.960
Oh, we're doing some yoga.

15:59.040 --> 16:01.000
Fucking hell, what's this?

16:01.080 --> 16:03.680
Close your eyes. Make a wish.

16:03.760 --> 16:05.880
Wishing that Becca's
going to kiss me.

16:07.400 --> 16:10.000
Find the balance and flow.

16:11.400 --> 16:12.440
Steady, steady.

16:12.520 --> 16:14.040
(gasps)

16:14.120 --> 16:16.680
(screams)
(laughs)

16:17.880 --> 16:22.040
I proper appreciate Rossy
just being dead fun with me.

16:23.080 --> 16:24.560
Oh.
(screams)

16:24.640 --> 16:26.440
I just fucking fancy her.

16:26.520 --> 16:28.480
Lower, lower, lower.
Jesus.

16:28.560 --> 16:30.000
Yes.
Shit.

16:30.080 --> 16:31.160
Yes.

16:31.240 --> 16:35.200
Becca's sitting on my back.
I wish she was sitting on my face.

16:36.640 --> 16:38.440
Whoo!

16:38.520 --> 16:40.040
(they laugh)

16:40.120 --> 16:42.280
Oh, how did that happen?

16:42.360 --> 16:45.320
Wye aye, what are you doing,
you cheeky bastard?

16:45.400 --> 16:46.960
(gasps)
Oh.

16:51.240 --> 16:52.960
Stop it!

17:00.280 --> 17:02.080
All right? What are you saying?

17:02.160 --> 17:04.040
What are you saying?

17:04.119 --> 17:08.160
She doesn't know Ross and Rebecca
have been out. I might stir the pot.

17:08.240 --> 17:09.920
What's been going on?

17:10.000 --> 17:11.800
Couple people have gone on a date.

17:11.880 --> 17:14.440
Yeah? Who?
Ross and Rebecca.

17:16.839 --> 17:21.040
Great. That's exactly what
I want to wake up to. Thanks, Josh.

17:21.119 --> 17:22.839
Right.

17:22.920 --> 17:25.640
I heard a rumour
that Rebecca fancies him.

17:26.640 --> 17:28.640
Yeah.
What the fuck?

17:28.720 --> 17:30.680
Like, another fucking head fuck.

17:32.720 --> 17:34.240
Peace out.
Peace out.

17:34.320 --> 17:35.360
I hope you cheer up.

17:35.440 --> 17:38.600
You look like a right grumpy bitch,
by the way.

17:38.680 --> 17:41.040
I actually fucking hate you!

17:41.120 --> 17:43.320
He's a fucking arsehole.

17:48.800 --> 17:50.560
It's awfully quiet, innit?

17:50.640 --> 17:52.280
Like, awfully quiet.

17:54.680 --> 17:55.760
(tablet chimes)

17:55.840 --> 17:57.680
(they groan)

17:57.760 --> 17:59.280
In the middle of my plait.

17:59.360 --> 18:01.360
I hope it's not to do
with me and Sean.

18:01.440 --> 18:04.560
"That's a storm brewing
as a new ex is on their way."

18:04.640 --> 18:06.320
"Adam, Jacques Fraser..."

18:06.400 --> 18:07.880
Little wanker.

18:07.960 --> 18:09.920
'...and Jack Devlin..."
Oh!

18:10.000 --> 18:12.000
"...time to meet your new arrival."

18:12.080 --> 18:15.440
It's three of Nicole's exes.
Her face is a picture.

18:15.520 --> 18:17.880
What the hell.
Are you trying to ruin my life?

18:17.960 --> 18:21.640
I think it's yours, Devlin.
I don't mate.

18:21.720 --> 18:22.760
Frankie?

18:22.840 --> 18:24.400
Yeah.
Why would it be her?

18:25.520 --> 18:29.160
I've banged her. You've banged her.
It's going to be Frankie

18:29.240 --> 18:32.640
and that's the girl the Jacques
Fraser cheated on Nicole with,

18:32.720 --> 18:33.800
in Ibiza.

18:36.640 --> 18:39.280
Jacques Fraser laid a shit
on the sunbed.

18:39.360 --> 18:43.280
What's the matter? Why are you
so worried? Clean that shit up.

18:43.360 --> 18:45.040
That's going to kick off.

18:45.120 --> 18:48.480
I want to fucking find out
what happened,

18:48.560 --> 18:50.920
why he said that.
It's going to kick off.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.760
I thought you trusted me.
I do.

18:52.840 --> 18:55.400
I want to know what's going on.
OK.

18:55.480 --> 18:57.040
Cool. Do what you got to do.

18:57.120 --> 18:59.720
Jacques Fraser's
being overly nice to me.

19:02.680 --> 19:04.440
There's something not right.

19:11.880 --> 19:15.320
I've had a sick date.
It's been proper good, hasn't it?

19:15.400 --> 19:18.040
Got me in them right positions,
didn't you, son?

19:19.160 --> 19:21.400
She fancies me. It's obvious, innit?

19:21.480 --> 19:23.320
(chuckles) Do you fancy me?

19:23.400 --> 19:24.800
Yeah.

19:26.200 --> 19:28.800
But I know in my heart, like...

19:31.240 --> 19:33.000
...that I do still love Aaron.

19:33.080 --> 19:35.800
And then you get thrown in the mix.
(they laugh)

19:35.880 --> 19:38.640
And I go, "Hey, it's Rossy."
Oh, you know.

19:40.080 --> 19:43.640
I feel comfortable around Ross.
He's letting me open up to him.

19:43.720 --> 19:46.280
You got to kiss me, though.
No.

19:46.360 --> 19:47.640
Yeah, you do.
No.

19:47.720 --> 19:51.040
All right, then.
No, cos Harriette will get upset.

19:52.320 --> 19:55.040
Even though I want to get
to know Ross a bit better,

19:55.120 --> 19:57.840
I just know I can't
go that step further.

19:57.920 --> 20:00.680
I've had a sick day.
Me too. It's been proper good.

20:01.720 --> 20:03.440
Today's date was a bit of fun.

20:03.520 --> 20:06.360
I did a bit of graft.
There's plenty more to come.

20:10.400 --> 20:12.400
'Ross, you might be having fun now,

20:12.480 --> 20:14.640
but this is Ex on the Beach.'

20:14.720 --> 20:18.280
'Fear and fury are always
just around the corner.'

20:18.360 --> 20:20.520
'Whose ex is next?'

20:25.240 --> 20:26.800
Aw, bruv.

20:28.160 --> 20:29.440
I'm pissing myself.

20:29.520 --> 20:33.960
Down here, you never know who's going
to come or what's going to happen.

20:34.040 --> 20:35.880
I don't think it's Frankie.

20:35.960 --> 20:37.600
Normally I love the beach.

20:37.680 --> 20:40.000
It's put me off for life
coming down here.

20:41.280 --> 20:43.240
I hope it's Frankie.

20:43.320 --> 20:47.080
If she's here, she can defend me
and say, "This is what happened."

20:47.160 --> 20:49.920
Frankie could come and say
I fucked her in Ibiza,

20:50.000 --> 20:51.720
but I know for a fact I never.

20:51.800 --> 20:55.080
I went to and I thought about
Nicole. I thought better of it.

20:57.360 --> 21:00.400
Jacques Fraser
is about to shit his pants.

21:00.480 --> 21:02.040
(echoes) Shit his pants.

21:20.480 --> 21:22.720
It is Frankie.
Is it?

21:22.800 --> 21:24.520
For fuck's sake.

21:24.600 --> 21:27.240
(laughs)

21:27.320 --> 21:29.040
(sighs)

21:29.120 --> 21:31.760
Jacques's face looks like
a slapped arse.

21:32.600 --> 21:34.280
How you been? You all right?

21:34.360 --> 21:36.240
What's going on? What's going on?

21:39.040 --> 21:42.200
I'm Frankie.
I've got the best tits in Essex.

21:42.280 --> 21:43.760
(laughs)

21:43.840 --> 21:46.680
I've had my boobs done, my lips
and Botox.

21:46.760 --> 21:49.480
And now I can't actually frown.

21:51.680 --> 21:55.040
I'm coming out to tell Nicole
her ex-boyfriend Jacques Fraser

21:55.120 --> 21:56.840
is a fucking cheat.

21:56.920 --> 21:58.760
(tuts)

21:58.840 --> 22:01.080
He cheated on her with me in Ibiza.

22:02.400 --> 22:05.560
Nicole should've kept Jacques Fraser
on a lead.

22:05.640 --> 22:07.840
(laughs)

22:07.920 --> 22:09.680
You need to tell the truth.

22:11.600 --> 22:15.040
Are you going to say I fucked you?
100% you did.

22:15.120 --> 22:18.840
I was hoping Frankie was going
to come so she can defend my corner.

22:18.920 --> 22:22.840
But where I've mugged her off,
she's come on revenge bullshit.

22:22.920 --> 22:25.720
What happened?
You know what happened that night.

22:25.800 --> 22:28.440
We went to the hotel. We did.
Yeah, we did.

22:28.520 --> 22:30.760
I mugged you off.
No, you didn't.

22:30.840 --> 22:32.840
What did we do, chat?
I don't think so.

22:32.920 --> 22:35.280
You are full of shit.
Tell the truth.

22:35.360 --> 22:36.840
You're mugging off Nicole.

22:36.920 --> 22:39.840
I mugged you off.
That definitely didn't happen.

22:39.920 --> 22:42.960
We did sleep with each other.
He needs to tell the truth.

22:43.040 --> 22:46.480
You're a scumbag.
You're the one that's cheated.

22:46.560 --> 22:48.320
A scumbag.
Tell the truth.

22:48.400 --> 22:50.640
You're lying.
Keep chatting your shit.

22:50.720 --> 22:54.360
I'm going to keep lying.
That's what I'm doing, ain't it.

22:54.440 --> 22:57.320
I believed from day one
that Jacques's a liar,

22:57.400 --> 22:58.840
but I had no proof.

22:58.920 --> 23:02.840
Now Frankie's come here
and said it to his face, he's fucked.

23:02.920 --> 23:04.720
He's fucked, mate.

23:05.720 --> 23:08.320
You're going to get hurt.
Cos I tell the truth?

23:08.400 --> 23:11.400
Regardless.
You cheated on them. You're fucked!

23:11.480 --> 23:13.880
When she sees you,
she's going to smash you.

23:13.960 --> 23:17.200
I'll tell the truth to Nicole
and Nicole will hate me for it,

23:17.320 --> 23:20.480
but would she rather me
come and laugh behind her back?

23:20.560 --> 23:22.720
I wouldn't rather that.

23:22.800 --> 23:25.600
I'm going to go sit over there.
Thank you.

23:25.680 --> 23:28.880
Keep yourself over there.
Shut up. Getting all defensive.

23:28.960 --> 23:30.440
(tablet chimes)

23:30.520 --> 23:32.520
This red little fucker.

23:32.600 --> 23:36.520
I'm going to pick it up, launch it
and volley the cunt over there.

23:36.600 --> 23:38.760
"Welcome to the beach, Frankie."

23:38.840 --> 23:41.760
"Adam and you are off to the bar
to mix it up a little bit."

23:41.840 --> 23:44.000
I'm happy to crack on with a fit bird

23:44.080 --> 23:49.360
and hear the story of what happened
with Jacques Fraser and Frankie.

23:49.440 --> 23:51.240
See you later.

23:51.320 --> 23:52.600
See you later.

23:54.160 --> 23:57.840
The truth's out there.
There's no coming back from this.

23:57.920 --> 23:58.960
What have I done?

23:59.040 --> 24:02.720
'It would seem you've told Nicole
one enormous porky, Jacques.'

24:04.920 --> 24:08.880
'After Ross's date with Becca,
it's time to face up to Harriette.'

24:08.960 --> 24:10.240
'This should go well.'

24:10.320 --> 24:12.080
Hello, everyone.
Hello.

24:12.160 --> 24:14.520
Aye, someone looks a bit happy.

24:14.600 --> 24:17.320
We went yoga, but in the sea
on paddle boards.

24:18.360 --> 24:20.840
I bet that was hard, wasn't it?
Nah.

24:20.920 --> 24:22.560
I had a great day with Becca.

24:22.640 --> 24:26.080
The second I walk in, Harriette
is staring at me like a pit bull.

24:26.160 --> 24:29.520
Well, if things was different
in here now,

24:30.600 --> 24:32.760
would you two have necked on?

24:38.360 --> 24:40.280
What do you mean?
That's a yes, then.

24:40.360 --> 24:42.880
No, it isn't.
I mean, he's good looking.

24:42.960 --> 24:45.000
No-one can deny that he's...

24:45.080 --> 24:46.920
Would you two have necked on?

24:49.960 --> 24:51.280
You didn't answer.

24:53.400 --> 24:55.360
Come on, Ross.
You can answer that.

24:55.440 --> 24:57.200
So, the answer's a yes, then.

24:57.280 --> 25:00.800
No, obviously,
if the situation was different...

25:00.880 --> 25:03.040
and I wasn't with Harriette
or whatever,

25:03.120 --> 25:05.720
then, yeah, probably.
But he is with Harriette.

25:05.800 --> 25:08.360
If I wasn't here
or the situation was different,

25:08.440 --> 25:12.400
he would probably fucking kiss her!
What the fuck?!

25:15.440 --> 25:19.520
What a bullshitting,
motherfucking cunt.

25:19.600 --> 25:21.680
I haven't done anything wrong, babe.

25:21.760 --> 25:24.880
You told me how much you like Ross.
I'm not going to kiss him.

25:24.960 --> 25:27.160
I'm not going to do anything
with Ross.

25:27.240 --> 25:28.960
I don't have a problem with you.

25:29.040 --> 25:31.480
He's meant to, like,
actually care about me.

25:31.560 --> 25:33.480
And I got one of them.

25:33.560 --> 25:37.120
The way you spoke to me, there's
no way I'm going to go there.

25:37.200 --> 25:39.560
Got another drink?
Want it over your head?

25:39.640 --> 25:41.000
Aaron, shut the fuck up.

25:41.080 --> 25:43.840
You're going to taste every drink
I have tonight.

25:43.920 --> 25:46.160
(indistinct shouting)

25:47.200 --> 25:49.720
I can push Becca's buttons
within an instant.

25:49.800 --> 25:51.960
That's two drinks you've wasted.

25:54.200 --> 25:57.000
Once again, she's flipped
and looks a fucking dick.

25:57.080 --> 25:59.520
Just come here. (laughs)

26:01.240 --> 26:04.120
I'm going to stay clear
of Harriette and speak to Becca

26:04.200 --> 26:06.080
cos we had a great date.

26:06.160 --> 26:08.320
(laughs)
Is Ross asking for a death wish?

26:10.000 --> 26:12.640
I don't know,
but they look quite cute together.

26:17.920 --> 26:21.520
All guys, if you break them down
and take their skin away from them,

26:21.600 --> 26:23.320
they're the same arsehole.

26:25.720 --> 26:29.600
Maybe it's cos they have
matching hair. His and hers.

26:33.000 --> 26:35.560
Ross has been selling the dream,
but guess what?

26:35.640 --> 26:37.480
Wide a-fucking-wake.

26:41.200 --> 26:44.480
Oh, I'm going to blow. I can feel it.
I can actually feel it.

26:48.040 --> 26:50.320
This is a better environment
than earlier.

26:50.400 --> 26:52.240
Earlier on was madness.

26:52.320 --> 26:56.120
Thank fuck I'm not sitting with that
yapping Chihuahua Jacques Fraser.

26:56.200 --> 26:58.880
Did you see when I walked over
how he looked at me?

26:58.960 --> 27:01.280
Oh, mate.
He stared at me and was like,

27:01.360 --> 27:03.160
"You're here to tell the story."

27:03.240 --> 27:06.320
I'm here to tell the truth.
You need to admit it as well.

27:06.400 --> 27:10.280
What girl would come into a villa
and lie about sleeping with someone?

27:10.360 --> 27:13.160
You wouldn't do it.
Cos what actually happened?

27:13.240 --> 27:15.640
He was going around,
acting mad sexy,

27:15.720 --> 27:18.040
going around about himself.

27:18.120 --> 27:22.200
Like, if I had a boyfriend,
you ain't moving like that.

27:22.280 --> 27:25.120
So, you went to his hotel
and you banged.

27:25.200 --> 27:27.240
Yeah, so we went to his hotel,
banged,

27:27.320 --> 27:30.080
and then I thought,
"What the fuck am I doing?"

27:30.160 --> 27:31.240
I knew it was true.

27:31.320 --> 27:35.360
Now I'm hearing more of Frankie's
story, it's clear that he's lying.

27:35.440 --> 27:38.520
I hope that he tells the truth.
He's going to look an idiot.

27:38.600 --> 27:41.560
Only thing is facing Nicole now.
I know.

27:41.640 --> 27:44.360
Would she rather me come in,
lie for Jacques

27:44.440 --> 27:47.200
and let her be mugged off
and let Jacques do it to her?

27:47.280 --> 27:51.240
Or we she prefer me come and tell
the truth so she don't get upset?

27:51.320 --> 27:54.720
You've got to have my back.
I'll have your back, no matter what.

27:56.760 --> 28:00.480
The villa's been hectic. What's
about to happen is on another level.

28:02.520 --> 28:04.520
I'm going to need full body armour.

28:04.600 --> 28:06.280
(laughs)

28:06.360 --> 28:10.320
And a riot shield to stop whatever
Nicole is going to throw at us.

28:17.920 --> 28:20.280
Chill, bro. Chill, bro.

28:20.360 --> 28:23.120
I'm going in there
and just be truthful with her.

28:26.600 --> 28:29.880
I'm really nervous,
but it's the best thing to do.

28:29.960 --> 28:31.720
What's the crack, lads?
So?

28:31.800 --> 28:34.520
Who came out?
Frankie.

28:34.600 --> 28:36.440
(thunder crashes)

28:40.480 --> 28:44.000
I just want to come out and be
a man about it and say I fucked up.

28:44.080 --> 28:46.120
I couldn't tell you. I was a coward.

28:47.320 --> 28:49.040
Hang on, so you did cheat on her?

28:51.720 --> 28:54.520
I've done it.
I'm sick to my stomach for doing it.

28:54.600 --> 28:55.760
You cheated on her?

28:57.040 --> 28:58.840
Fucking idiot.

29:05.560 --> 29:09.760
Why the fuck you been lying all
this time? I knew it. I hate him.

29:11.200 --> 29:14.640
I feel absolutely devastated,

29:14.720 --> 29:17.720
heartbroken that he could
do that to me.

29:17.800 --> 29:20.440
You go away for two days.
I drop you to the airport.

29:20.520 --> 29:23.000
I'm at home washing
and ironing your clothes.

29:23.080 --> 29:25.160
I pick you up
and you fuck someone else.

29:25.240 --> 29:27.680
In them two days.
Two days is all it took you.

29:27.760 --> 29:29.200
It...
Shut your mouth now.

29:29.280 --> 29:33.320
Why would you do that?
What goes through these boys' heads

29:33.400 --> 29:37.320
of how much they love you and want
kids with you and want to marry you,

29:37.400 --> 29:40.920
but they want to go out two nights
on holiday and fuck another bird.

29:41.000 --> 29:44.480
It does not make sense.
The boy's a cunt. He's disgusting.

29:44.560 --> 29:47.400
I've put up with you cheating
and I forgived you.

29:47.480 --> 29:49.720
And I stood by you
through thick and thin

29:49.800 --> 29:51.400
and I've never cheated on you

29:51.480 --> 29:53.160
and I never would've.
I know.

29:53.240 --> 29:57.040
That's because I love you. I don't
know what love you've got for me.

29:57.120 --> 29:59.000
It ain't love cos you don't love...

29:59.080 --> 30:01.200
You love someone no matter what.

30:01.280 --> 30:04.720
If you have met your soulmate
and your best friend,

30:04.800 --> 30:07.960
you would not sleep with someone.
You are my best friend.

30:08.040 --> 30:11.000
You are my best friend
and I wouldn't do that to you!

30:11.080 --> 30:12.800
I'm sorry.
You are my best friend

30:12.880 --> 30:16.240
and I wouldn't do that to you.
I wouldn't dream of doing that.

30:16.320 --> 30:18.360
How can you do that to me?

30:18.440 --> 30:21.480
It weren't me.
My whole life, I changed for you.

30:21.560 --> 30:24.560
It weren't me. That weren't me.

30:24.640 --> 30:27.440
What is real anymore? What is real?

30:27.520 --> 30:29.600
Please explain to me,
what is so real?

30:29.680 --> 30:31.120
Because you're not real.

30:31.200 --> 30:33.320
I'm fucking sorry.
What else can I say?

30:44.480 --> 30:48.280
'Ah, looks like Nicole's
finally calmed down.'

30:48.360 --> 30:49.600
'But not for long.'

30:51.320 --> 30:54.440
Oh, here comes
the dirty, fucking fat slag.

30:54.520 --> 30:56.960
You're not welcome. Go away!

30:57.040 --> 31:01.240
I don't know how Frankie's got
an arsehole to walk in this villa.

31:01.320 --> 31:04.920
You fucking slag! I ain't
letting her get away with it.

31:05.000 --> 31:06.840
See what I'll do to you.

31:06.920 --> 31:09.240
(indistinct shouting)

31:09.320 --> 31:13.400
Big meatball head, ugly fucking
slag. Slag, slag, slag, slag, slag.

31:13.480 --> 31:15.360
You fucking sore.

31:15.440 --> 31:17.200
Ding, ding. Here we go.

31:17.280 --> 31:18.840
Slag!

31:18.920 --> 31:22.520
Round two, three, four, five
and six, all in one go.

31:22.600 --> 31:25.560
How can you walk in the villa
and mug yourself off?

31:25.640 --> 31:27.360
You've more front than Tesco.

31:27.440 --> 31:30.560
Should you not shout at Jacques?
Jacques is the liar here.

31:31.680 --> 31:35.440
How many boys did you fuck?
You don't know what I'm capable of.

31:35.520 --> 31:39.200
Nicole is three feet tall, but
that girl is an angry little fucker.

31:39.280 --> 31:43.160
When she starts swinging them fists,
I am diving out of the fucking way.

31:43.240 --> 31:46.360
How can she... Hey! Listen!

31:46.440 --> 31:48.960
Do not fuck with me now.
How can you walk in here?

31:49.040 --> 31:52.360
Nicole's lost her head.
Ain't nowhere this girl can hide.

31:52.440 --> 31:54.120
How can you...
Nic, Nic, Nic.

31:54.200 --> 31:56.480
Get off me.
Nic, Nic, Nic, I love you.

31:56.560 --> 31:59.960
(indistinct shouting)

32:00.040 --> 32:02.360
Walk away now. Walk away now.
Walk away now.

32:03.880 --> 32:05.760
I got done with a drink.

32:06.800 --> 32:08.880
That's my only shirt.
(laughs)

32:08.960 --> 32:11.120
I wanted to come in here
and make friends.

32:11.200 --> 32:13.200
I don't know easy
that's going to be.

32:13.280 --> 32:16.080
The thing is,
she's screaming and blazing...

32:16.160 --> 32:18.000
Frankie, come outside.

32:18.080 --> 32:21.680
How can you to come in here? How
have you got the front to come here?

32:21.760 --> 32:23.920
Come and talk to me.
How have you?

32:24.000 --> 32:26.840
Stop shouting.
These girls, they're all my mates.

32:26.920 --> 32:28.800
You ain't going to have no friends!

32:28.880 --> 32:32.240
You are a filthy, fat, ugly slag.

32:32.320 --> 32:36.000
Everyone has fucked you!
Everyone has fucked you!

32:36.080 --> 32:38.360
(indistinct)
Piss off.

32:38.440 --> 32:41.080
(indistinct)
There's ten people and one girl.

32:41.160 --> 32:43.800
What Frankie done is wrong

32:43.880 --> 32:47.520
is she knew that Jacques
had a girlfriend. She didn't know.

32:47.600 --> 32:49.760
Ten people on one girl.

32:49.840 --> 32:51.880
(indistinct arguing)

33:04.920 --> 33:07.560
You are fucking disgusting!
(indistinct)

33:07.640 --> 33:09.040
Come and talk to me.

33:11.920 --> 33:15.280
I've done what I've done
and I'm finished. I now feel better.

33:15.360 --> 33:17.160
All right, now, come on.

33:17.240 --> 33:19.640
No, I'm walking out tonight anyway.

33:19.720 --> 33:21.080
I'm walking out!

33:23.000 --> 33:25.800
Ladies don't fight
and carry themselves like that.

33:25.880 --> 33:29.440
When you're ready to talk, I'll
speak to you like a proper lady.

33:31.320 --> 33:33.560
Fuck off away from me.
Go away from me.

33:33.640 --> 33:35.640
Get away.
Why are you shouting?

33:35.720 --> 33:38.840
You're a scumbag.
Why are you angry?

33:38.920 --> 33:41.160
Because you're a scumbag.
You're fucked.

33:41.240 --> 33:44.160
(indistinct)
I promise you that now.

33:44.240 --> 33:47.640
Trust me on that one.
You are fucked.

33:47.720 --> 33:50.440
Hey, is he shouting at you now?
Yeah, that's me.

33:50.520 --> 33:52.720
I don't like this Frankie girl,

33:52.800 --> 33:55.320
but he spoke to her like shit.
Mate, fuck off.

33:55.400 --> 33:57.520
What are you talking like that for?

33:57.600 --> 33:59.840
Are you being serious?
Are you serious?

33:59.920 --> 34:03.560
Don't tell me fuck. She's
the scumbag. She's the scumbag.

34:03.640 --> 34:06.600
I don't give a shit.
She ain't a bird. She's a scumbag.

34:06.680 --> 34:09.520
You think you're a big lad.
You're a pussy.

34:09.600 --> 34:11.560
Fuck off.
Don't speak like that.

34:11.639 --> 34:14.880
Do something.
In one shot, you'll be out cold.

34:14.960 --> 34:17.120
All right, go for it.
I bang for fun.

34:17.199 --> 34:18.360
It don't wash with me.

34:18.440 --> 34:20.480
I bang for fun.
Go ahead.

34:20.560 --> 34:24.159
Where I come from, if you offer a
free shot, they're going to take it

34:24.239 --> 34:26.199
and you're going to end
on your arse.

34:26.280 --> 34:29.280
Don't speak to birds.
Or what? Or fucking what?

34:29.360 --> 34:31.600
Don't speak like that.
Or fucking what?

34:31.679 --> 34:34.239
Josh can pick him up
and flick him away!

34:34.320 --> 34:36.800
Get out, shut the door behind you
and fuck off.

34:37.880 --> 34:39.960
You ain't going to do nothing.

34:40.040 --> 34:41.840
One lift and you'd be on the floor.

34:41.920 --> 34:44.639
One swift lift, mate?
And you'd be out cold.

34:44.719 --> 34:46.719
One swift lift? See you later.

34:46.800 --> 34:48.280
Bye-bye.

34:52.719 --> 34:57.320
With everything going on, I haven't
had a chance to speak to Harriette,

34:57.400 --> 34:59.360
the one person I need to speak to.

34:59.440 --> 35:00.560
Since day one...

35:00.640 --> 35:03.760
I would never,
ever in a million years, yeah,

35:03.840 --> 35:05.360
ever in a million years,

35:05.440 --> 35:09.120
say if some guy came in and you
weren't even here, that I'd crack on.

35:09.200 --> 35:11.600
You know what?
I'm going to crack on.

35:11.680 --> 35:13.080
I'm bored of being down.

35:13.160 --> 35:14.880
I've got nothing else to say.

35:14.960 --> 35:18.560
If you walk away now, I swear to God.
Like, I swear to God.

35:18.640 --> 35:20.280
I'm telling you it's over.

35:20.360 --> 35:21.880
This time I mean it.

35:21.960 --> 35:23.680
See you later. Fuck off. Done.

35:25.040 --> 35:27.920
What a fucking immature cunt, mate.

35:28.000 --> 35:31.920
That's fucking nasty.
What have I done to deserve that?

35:32.000 --> 35:33.280
How old are you?

35:33.360 --> 35:35.760
You can't even have
a conversation with me.

35:35.840 --> 35:38.000
I ain't a dickhead.
All right.

35:38.080 --> 35:40.120
It's making things
a lot easier for me

35:40.200 --> 35:43.400
because if you're that crazy, babe,
I can't be with you.

35:48.160 --> 35:49.280
I'm not a dickhead.

35:49.360 --> 35:52.080
You sat there and told me
if I was not in this villa,

35:52.160 --> 35:55.440
you'd kiss some other girl.
I was in this villa.

35:55.520 --> 35:58.280
I was in this villa
and you necked with another guy,

35:58.360 --> 36:00.040
When I was in this villa.

36:00.120 --> 36:04.560
If that really got to you, you should
not have slept with me afterwards.

36:04.640 --> 36:06.640
You shouldn't have.
I'm getting off.

36:06.720 --> 36:10.520
You think I don't regret everything
I've done with you. I slept with you.

36:10.600 --> 36:12.800
I must've lost my fucking head
in here.

36:12.880 --> 36:16.440
I genuinely thought
he was a nice guy.

36:18.080 --> 36:19.800
And he's not.

36:19.880 --> 36:22.320
I honestly fell for you. Massively.

36:22.400 --> 36:24.720
But, do you know what? Pfft.

36:24.800 --> 36:27.440
I don't know.
I don't even know why.

36:27.520 --> 36:30.000
At the end of the day, I'm human.

36:30.080 --> 36:31.920
I got caught up in his shit.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.760
I don't even know why I'm here.

36:37.320 --> 36:39.760
Fuck this shit.
I can't be arsed, mate.

36:39.840 --> 36:43.520
The only worry I've got, mate, is
where the fuck am I going to sleep?

36:47.080 --> 36:49.760
You are fucking sick, mate.

36:49.840 --> 36:53.240
I don't think Jacques's sorry.
Why would you pack your case

36:53.320 --> 36:55.720
and get out of here?
He's shitting his arse.

36:55.800 --> 36:58.120
No-one cares about my feelings.
I care.

36:58.200 --> 36:59.480
Really?
I'm in pieces.

36:59.560 --> 37:00.640
Really?

37:00.720 --> 37:03.480
Why aren't you fucking begging
at her fucking feet

37:03.560 --> 37:05.800
and saying fucking sorry to her?!

37:05.880 --> 37:08.960
Beg at her fucking feet!
Babe. Babe, that's her argument.

37:09.040 --> 37:11.880
It's their argument, not yours.
Fuck you!

37:11.960 --> 37:13.200
(murmurs)

37:13.280 --> 37:15.480
Shut the fuck up, Maisie, you cunt.

37:15.560 --> 37:18.080
I just asked her...
(indistinct shouting)

37:18.160 --> 37:19.440
Fuck you!

37:19.520 --> 37:21.480
Fucking arsehole.

37:21.560 --> 37:23.040
Can I talk to you quickly?

37:23.120 --> 37:26.280
You're a fucking slut,
you little fucking slut.

37:26.360 --> 37:29.760
Fuck off, Becks.
You're five foot nothing. (groans)

37:29.840 --> 37:31.360
I'm so fucking angry at her.

37:31.440 --> 37:33.760
How can you do that to me, man?

37:33.840 --> 37:35.960
I thought you actually loved me.

37:36.040 --> 37:38.280
And you lied to my face. You lied.

37:39.840 --> 37:42.560
Yeah, I did.
You cheated on me with that.

37:42.640 --> 37:47.200
Frankie's like one of the girls
you see in Amsterdam in the windows.

37:47.280 --> 37:50.360
Look at your girlfriend
and at that meatball head cunt.

37:50.440 --> 37:52.520
Why do boys...
What is wrong with you?

37:52.600 --> 37:55.000
I fucked up, Nic.
You fucked up, majorly.

37:55.080 --> 37:58.680
There's no going back. You're
fucked. You've lost me. I'm gone.

37:58.760 --> 38:00.000
You live with that.

38:00.080 --> 38:03.680
I'm sure I can find a decent bloke
who ain't going to do that to me.

38:03.760 --> 38:06.920
Just thrown it all away
for a fucking stupid night out.

38:08.000 --> 38:09.400
I'll meet someone else.

38:10.800 --> 38:14.000
You ain't all that and a bag
of chips. You're disgusting.

38:17.840 --> 38:20.360
Do you think my mum's
going to talk to you?

38:22.080 --> 38:26.000
You've broke my heart. You've let
my family down. You're fucking vile.

38:26.080 --> 38:29.280
It's finished.
Nothing to talk about, Jacques.

38:32.840 --> 38:34.040
(sighs)

38:35.305 --> 38:41.673
