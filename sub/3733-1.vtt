WEBVTT

00:02.370 --> 00:05.521
- Previously:
- Hannibal!
- We are as close as we are

00:05.570 --> 00:08.459
ever going to get
to catching this man.

00:08.500 --> 00:11.708
- I'm dismantling who I was
and moving it brick by brick.

00:11.740 --> 00:15.528
It's the last stage
of a transformation.
We could disappear now.

00:15.580 --> 00:18.799
- You've set some
sort of trap and you're
goading Hannibal into it.

00:18.850 --> 00:22.342
- How can you be sure he's
not goading you?
- I can't.

00:22.390 --> 00:25.518
- I have begun to
question your actions

00:25.550 --> 00:29.429
with regards to my attack.
I am no longer your therapist.

00:29.460 --> 00:32.429
You are dangerous.

00:59.360 --> 01:03.478
***

01:29.320 --> 01:31.117
(engine sound)

01:37.160 --> 01:39.458
***

01:56.250 --> 01:58.206
(engine stopping)

01:58.250 --> 02:00.548
(sirens and traffic from afar)

02:02.550 --> 02:06.350
(nothing but music
from this point on)

03:03.550 --> 03:05.745
(Ambient sound returns.)

03:05.780 --> 03:09.216
- Antony Dimmond.
- Boris Jakov.

03:09.250 --> 03:11.741
- I'd offer a hand, but...
- It's a double-fisted

03:11.790 --> 03:14.486
kind of bash.

03:14.520 --> 03:17.318
- Do you know
Roman well?

03:17.360 --> 03:18.952
You were staring with
the thinly-veiled disdain

03:18.990 --> 03:22.869
of a man who does.
I was his TA at Cambridge.

03:22.900 --> 03:25.619
He was insufferable
even then.

03:28.800 --> 03:31.860
- Have you
read his books?

03:31.910 --> 03:34.401
(whispering): They're terrible.

03:34.440 --> 03:36.579
You know they're terrible,
you're just too polite to say.

03:36.610 --> 03:38.976
Blink if you agree.

03:39.010 --> 03:42.480
See?

03:42.520 --> 03:44.385
That doesn't stop him
squatting over his keyboard

03:44.420 --> 03:46.650
and depositing a fresh one
every six to eight months.

03:46.690 --> 03:49.784
It takes me six to eight
months to write one line.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.957
- Why?

03:51.990 --> 03:54.254
- Poetry is hard.

03:54.300 --> 03:57.326
Too hard for Roman.
Well, it's easier for him

03:57.370 --> 03:59.338
to slide into academia and
dissect the work of others

03:59.370 --> 04:01.395
than it is to stand
by his own words.

04:01.440 --> 04:03.806
- One can appreciate
another's words

04:03.840 --> 04:06.900
without dissecting them.

04:06.940 --> 04:10.478
Though, on occasion, dissection
is the only thing that will do.

04:10.510 --> 04:11.943
(glass shattering)

04:35.100 --> 04:38.558
- Bonsoir.

04:40.580 --> 04:42.571
- Bonsoir.

04:47.020 --> 04:48.817
(engine starting)

05:06.400 --> 05:08.891
Bonsoir?

05:08.940 --> 05:12.376
- Bonsoir.

05:15.640 --> 05:18.803
(soft scratching)

05:18.850 --> 05:21.648
***

05:21.680 --> 05:25.548
(classical tenor voice)

06:16.970 --> 06:18.665
Bonsoir.

06:18.710 --> 06:20.928
(theme music)

07:14.800 --> 07:18.793
- You really are the Devil.

07:22.170 --> 07:25.105
You have a click in your hoof.
- The Devil has been a yoke

07:25.140 --> 07:28.803
on the neck of humanity since we
first began to think and dream.

07:28.840 --> 07:32.105
I for a much shorter time.
- You admit the yoke.

07:34.680 --> 07:37.478
Smells of candy apples

07:37.520 --> 07:40.057
and thyme.

07:40.090 --> 07:43.480
You smoked me in thyme.

07:43.530 --> 07:48.058
- Smoked, glazed, served
on a sugar cane quill.

07:48.100 --> 07:51.228
You will be
falling off the bone.

07:51.270 --> 07:54.967
- Well, of course. And
with these rarified dishes

07:55.000 --> 07:56.968
you so carefully
prepare...

07:57.010 --> 08:00.673
do we all...
taste different?

08:00.710 --> 08:03.679
- Everyone has
their flavor.

08:03.710 --> 08:06.713
- Cannibalism was standard
behaVIor among our ancestors.

08:06.750 --> 08:10.516
The missing link was only
missing because we ate him.

08:10.550 --> 08:12.609
- This isn't
cannibalism, Abel.

08:12.660 --> 08:14.958
It's only cannibalism
if we're equals.

08:17.160 --> 08:20.618
- This is only cannibalism
if you eat me.

08:20.660 --> 08:23.629
But you just feel this is
the natural order of things.

08:23.670 --> 08:25.820
Everybody gets et.

08:25.870 --> 08:28.668
- Be he fat or be he lean.

08:28.700 --> 08:31.999
- With my last leg
standing next to me,

08:32.040 --> 08:36.602
I should still wrestle with
the urges to fight or flee.

08:36.650 --> 08:40.074
_- It's called
"terminal restlessness."

08:40.120 --> 08:44.045
The body fills with adrenaline
and feels compelled to go-go-go.

08:44.090 --> 08:47.912
- "Go-go-go"? I've
already gone up and gone.

08:47.960 --> 08:51.555
This is posthumous.

08:51.590 --> 08:53.729
- You're not dead yet,
Abel. You still have to eat.

08:53.760 --> 08:56.149
- No, I don't.

09:00.170 --> 09:04.106
At this point, there is
absolutely nothing I have to do.

09:06.910 --> 09:10.277
But I shouldn't spoil
the fairy tale, should I?

09:10.310 --> 09:13.211
You and your little
gingerbread house.

09:16.150 --> 09:18.880
- Let it be a fairy tale, then.

09:18.920 --> 09:21.582
Once upon a time...

09:21.620 --> 09:23.224
(classical music)

10:01.400 --> 10:04.767
- Bellissi_ma.
- GraZIe.

10:07.170 --> 10:09.138
- Dr. Fell,

10:09.170 --> 10:12.105
I hope you translate
as well as you waltz.

10:12.140 --> 10:15.337
Mrs. Fell. _
- Our new appomtee

10:15.380 --> 10:19.202
was confirmed by the board
after close questioning.

10:19.250 --> 10:21.969
- You've examined him
In medieval Italian

10:22.020 --> 10:23.840
and I will not deny

10:23.890 --> 10:26.017
his language is...

10:26.050 --> 10:28.257
admirable...

10:28.290 --> 10:30.281
- Thank you.
- for a straniero.

10:30.330 --> 10:33.128
Are you familiar
with the personalities

10:33.160 --> 10:35.253
of pre-Renaissance Florence?

10:35.300 --> 10:38.167
I think not.

10:38.200 --> 10:41.192
Dr. Fell might
hold in his hand -

10:41.240 --> 10:44.232
in his non-Italian hand -

10:44.270 --> 10:47.307
a note from
Dante Alighieri himself.

10:47.340 --> 10:50.377
Would he recognize it?

10:50.410 --> 10:53.743
I think not.

10:53.780 --> 10:56.681
- Professor Sogliato, would you
do me the honor of a dance?

10:56.720 --> 10:58.745
- Of course.

11:02.830 --> 11:05.879
- "Allegro mi sembrava Amor

11:05.930 --> 11:08.956
"tenendo meo core in mano,

11:09.000 --> 11:13.289
_"e ne le braccia avea madonna
Involta In un drappo dormendo.

11:13.340 --> 11:16.468
"Poi la svegliava,
e d'esto core ardendo

11:16.500 --> 11:21.130
"lei paventosa
umilmente pascea;

11:21.180 --> 11:24.343
appreso gir lo
ne vedea piangendo."

11:26.850 --> 11:28.772
Dante's first sonnet.

11:28.820 --> 11:32.347
It fascinated Cavalcanti. The
eating of the heart is a
powerful image.

11:32.390 --> 11:34.415
- If he's such
an expert on Dante,

11:34.460 --> 11:38.180
let him lecture
on Dante, to the Studiolo.

11:38.230 --> 11:40.494
Let him face them.

11:40.530 --> 11:42.259
Extempore.

11:42.300 --> 11:44.996
- I'm happy to sing
for my supper.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.161
- Professor Sogliato.

12:02.550 --> 12:06.179
- We are among the palaces
built six hundred years ago

12:06.220 --> 12:08.757
by the merchant princes,
the kingmakers

12:08.790 --> 12:11.850
and _the connivers
of Renaissance Florence.

12:11.890 --> 12:17.192
- As connivers
of modern Florence.

12:17.230 --> 12:18.219
- I've found a peace here

12:18.270 --> 12:20.488
that I would preserve.

12:20.540 --> 12:23.907
I've killed hardly anybody
during our residence.

12:23.940 --> 12:27.034
- You created a vacancy

12:27.080 --> 12:31.176
at the Palazzo Capponi by
removing the former curator.

12:31.210 --> 12:33.110
- A simple process requiring
a few seconds' work

12:33.150 --> 12:35.209
on the old man...

12:35.250 --> 12:38.481
and a modest outlay
for two bags of cement.

12:38.520 --> 12:41.978
- You no longer have
ethical concerns, Hannibal.

12:42.020 --> 12:44.523
You have aesthetical ones.

12:47.060 --> 12:49.255
- Ethics become aesthetics.

12:49.300 --> 12:51.894
- You seem more interested
In makIng appearances

12:51.930 --> 12:53.534
than maintaining them.

12:53.570 --> 12:55.788
Would you?

12:58.240 --> 13:01.004
- If_ this is about
my pOSItIon at the Palazzo,

13:01.040 --> 13:03.076
once the path was cleared,

13:03.110 --> 13:05.408
I won the job fairly.

13:05.450 --> 13:07.941
On my merits.

13:07.980 --> 13:11.313
- Yes, even the most
contentious Florentines

13:11.350 --> 13:15.059
can't resist the verse of Dante
rIngIng off of frescoed walls.

13:19.060 --> 13:21.927
- One contentious
FlorentIne can.

13:29.000 --> 13:33.369
- Have you given serious thought
to eating Professor Sogliato?

13:33.410 --> 13:37.403
- My killing Sogliato now
would not preserve the peace.

13:37.450 --> 13:41.079
(squeaky faucet)

13:41.120 --> 13:44.283
- Your peace is
without morality.

13:44.320 --> 13:47.357
- Morality doesn't exist.

13:47.390 --> 13:50.553
Only morale.

13:50.590 --> 13:53.093
- How you feel today.

13:53.130 --> 13:57.021
- How do YOU feel today?

13:57.070 --> 13:59.459
_- I still believe I am
In conSCIous control

13:59.500 --> 14:01.889
of my actions.

14:01.940 --> 14:03.908
Given your history...

14:03.940 --> 14:06.101
that's a good day.

14:21.460 --> 14:25.248
(water dripping)

15:14.010 --> 15:17.400
(panﬁng)

15:25.690 --> 15:28.284
If you think you're
about to catch Hannibal,

15:28.320 --> 15:31.153
it's because he wants
you to thInk that.

15:31.190 --> 15:34.353
Don't fool yourself

15:34.400 --> 15:37.528
into thinking he's not in
control of what's happening.

17:17.830 --> 17:21.231
(cocking of a gun)

17:29.780 --> 17:32.169
- May I get dressed?

17:32.210 --> 17:35.475
- You may.

17:44.530 --> 17:46.555
What have you done, Hannibal?

17:46.590 --> 17:49.627
- I've taken off my person suit.

17:52.370 --> 17:55.339
- You let them
see you.

17:57.340 --> 18:00.503
- I let them see enough.

18:02.580 --> 18:04.548
- How does it feel...

18:04.580 --> 18:07.174
being seen?

18:07.220 --> 18:10.542
- Well, you're in no position
to ask, Dr. Du Maurier.

18:10.590 --> 18:14.310
You ended our patient-
psychiatrist relationship.

18:17.260 --> 18:21.799
- I lacked the appropriate
skills to continue your therapy.

18:24.200 --> 18:27.590
- I never found you
to be lacking.

18:30.210 --> 18:32.531
- I'm sorry I didn't provide you

18:32.570 --> 18:34.879
with a suitable
substitute for therapy.

18:37.650 --> 18:41.677
Is Will Graham still alive?

18:44.650 --> 18:48.586
- Will Graham was not a suitable
substitute for therapy.

18:51.260 --> 18:53.421
- What was he?

18:53.460 --> 18:56.793
_- Is this _ _
profeSSIonal curIOSIty?

18:56.830 --> 18:59.799
- Almost entirely.

19:05.510 --> 19:07.307
- Do you trust me?

19:10.350 --> 19:12.306
- Not entirely.

19:12.350 --> 19:14.910
- Are you taking
into consideration

19:14.950 --> 19:17.316
my beliefs about
your intentions?

19:17.350 --> 19:20.387
- My intentions?

19:20.420 --> 19:25.323
-_ Human motivation can be
lIttle more than IUCld greed.

19:25.360 --> 19:27.396
- Greed...

19:29.560 --> 19:31.892
and blind optimism.

19:31.930 --> 19:35.934
- You're optimistic
I won't kill you.

19:35.970 --> 19:39.303
(uncocking of the gun.)

19:59.390 --> 20:02.689
(bells ringing)

20:29.620 --> 20:31.952
- Due bottiglie
di Btard-Montrachet

20:31.990 --> 20:34.595
e li tartufi bianchi,
per favore.

21:57.080 --> 21:58.877
- Hello!

22:01.080 --> 22:03.344
Bonjour!

22:03.390 --> 22:05.517
Mr. Jakov, isn't it?

22:05.550 --> 22:07.780
We met in Paris
a few months back.

22:07.820 --> 22:10.789
Sorry, I didn't mean
to startle you,

22:10.830 --> 22:13.355
it's just... here I was
and then, there you were...

22:13.400 --> 22:15.129
I never forget a face.

22:15.160 --> 22:18.368
- Antony Dimmond.
- Nice to be remembered.

22:18.400 --> 22:21.631
- You're hard to forget.
- What are you doing
in Florence?

22:21.670 --> 22:24.537
Are you working with Roman?
- Dr. Fell?

22:24.570 --> 22:27.004
- I heard he took an appointment
at the Capponi library.

22:27.040 --> 22:30.100
- Yes, he's the new curator
and translator at the
Palazzo CapponI.

22:30.140 --> 22:32.506
- Evidently, the last one
eloped with a woman

22:32.550 --> 22:35.110
or someone's
money or both.

22:35.150 --> 22:37.448
- That's the
commonly held belief.

22:37.490 --> 22:40.857
You just missed Roman.
- Did I?

22:40.890 --> 22:44.348
Was hoping
to take the piss.

22:46.690 --> 22:48.749
- Spare the piss for the time
being. If you're free,

22:48.800 --> 22:50.722
my wife and I would love
to have you for dinner.

23:31.870 --> 23:34.839
Listen.

23:34.880 --> 23:38.179
They prefer eating in company.

23:38.210 --> 23:41.976
I've kept cochlear gardens
since I was a young man,

23:42.020 --> 23:44.648
fattening snails
on herbs and vine leaves.

23:44.690 --> 23:46.885
Like all of us,
what they eat

23:46.920 --> 23:49.650
greatly influences and
enhances their flavor.

23:49.690 --> 23:52.181
- When I'm not busy
eating myself,

23:52.230 --> 23:55.893
you wish me to be
eating oysters,

23:55.930 --> 23:59.468
drinking sweet wines
and snacking on acorns.

23:59.500 --> 24:03.095
All to make me tastier?

24:03.140 --> 24:07.531
- Oh yes. And you are
making them tastier.

24:07.580 --> 24:10.140
- And I you.

24:10.180 --> 24:13.047
Imagine what you
must taste like.

24:13.080 --> 24:16.470
Won't be long until someone's
taking a bite out of you.

24:16.520 --> 24:19.580
- You're becoming
brighter, Abel.

24:19.620 --> 24:22.157
Dying hasn't dulled you one bit.

24:24.160 --> 24:28.654
- The snails are certainly
having a lovely experience,

24:28.700 --> 24:30.998
fattened on me

24:31.030 --> 24:33.567
in a red-wine marinade.

24:33.600 --> 24:35.966
They have no idea

24:36.000 --> 24:38.730
they're going to be eaten.

24:38.770 --> 24:42.570
We do.

24:42.610 --> 24:45.101

24:45.150 --> 24:49.940
(jazz music)

25:21.250 --> 25:23.309
- How well do you
know the Fells?

25:23.350 --> 25:27.719
- As well as anybody.
Which'd be not really.

25:27.760 --> 25:32.151
Lydia a friend of yours?

25:32.190 --> 25:34.249
- Not really.

25:34.300 --> 25:36.757
- I'd be surprised
to hear she had one.

25:36.800 --> 25:39.621
We share a mutual detestation.

25:39.670 --> 25:42.969
She disapproves
of my disapproval.

25:44.970 --> 25:46.631
- What do you disapprove of?

25:46.670 --> 25:49.833
- Roman, mainly. Lydia isn't
quite bright enough to see

25:49.880 --> 25:52.769
I'm just intimidated.
Roman does, of course.

25:52.810 --> 25:55.677
How he loves to strike fear.

25:55.720 --> 25:58.939
- Dante wrote that fear is
almost as bitter as death.

26:01.160 --> 26:04.687
- Dante wasn't dead
when he wrote it.

26:04.730 --> 26:08.154
- Are you traveling
alone, Antony?

26:08.200 --> 26:10.623
- The only way I travel.

26:10.670 --> 26:12.319
- Oh!

26:14.240 --> 26:17.767
Roman is speaking to the
Studiolo Friday, on Dante.

26:17.810 --> 26:21.132
You should come.
- Sounds appropriately hellish.

26:25.350 --> 26:28.069
Are you avoiding meats?

26:32.090 --> 26:35.059
- I'm trying not to eat anything
with a central nervous system.

26:35.090 --> 26:39.026
- Oysters, acorns and Marsala.

26:39.060 --> 26:40.891
That's what ancient Romans
would feed animals

26:40.930 --> 26:43.660
to improve their flavor.

26:52.310 --> 26:55.279
- My husband

26:55.310 --> 26:57.278
has a very
sophisticated palate.

26:57.310 --> 26:59.676
He's very particular

26:59.710 --> 27:02.838
about how I taste.

27:09.820 --> 27:11.629
- Is it that kind of party?

27:16.260 --> 27:19.889
- It's not that kind of party.

27:19.930 --> 27:22.330
- No,

27:22.370 --> 27:25.407
it really isn't.

27:25.440 --> 27:28.273
- Shame.

27:28.310 --> 27:30.437
You were both
suddenly so fascinating.

27:30.480 --> 27:33.040
Hm!

27:36.180 --> 27:39.013
- Buonasera.
- (both): Buonasera.

27:45.760 --> 27:48.126
- You let him go.

27:50.330 --> 27:52.298
- What would you
have me do, Bedelia?

28:27.870 --> 28:30.168
- Due bottiglie
di Btard-Montrachet

28:30.200 --> 28:31.963
e li tartufi bianchi,
per favore.

28:47.490 --> 28:49.458
- Grazie.

29:25.890 --> 29:28.996
(shalq breathing)

29:56.160 --> 29:59.129
(moan)

30:04.630 --> 30:06.860
- Bedelia.

30:09.270 --> 30:11.261
- He attacked me.

30:15.310 --> 30:18.245
- Is that your blood?

30:19.580 --> 30:22.174
- No.

30:29.460 --> 30:32.156
- You were defending yourself?

30:33.590 --> 30:37.048
- I was reckless.

30:39.530 --> 30:42.192
- This wasn't reckless violence.

30:42.240 --> 30:47.132
It was a controlled
use of force.

30:47.170 --> 30:50.276
- I know what happened.

30:50.310 --> 30:53.143
- Do you?

30:54.350 --> 30:56.944
- He was your patient
before he was mine.

31:01.020 --> 31:03.557
- He died under your care.

31:05.160 --> 31:07.628
You were not
defending yourself.

31:32.350 --> 31:34.386
- I can help you tell
the version of events

31:34.420 --> 31:36.854
you want to be told.

31:40.730 --> 31:43.324
I can help you...

31:43.360 --> 31:46.124
if you ask me to.

31:49.400 --> 31:51.209
- Will you help me?

32:05.390 --> 32:09.258
- In accord with my own taste
for the pre-Renaissance,

32:09.290 --> 32:12.589
I present the case
of Pietro della Vigna,

32:12.630 --> 32:17.090
whose treachery earned him
a place in Dante's Hell.

32:17.130 --> 32:19.690
- He was disgraced
and blinded for betraying

32:19.730 --> 32:23.291
his emperor's trust.

32:23.340 --> 32:25.661
Dante's pilgrim finds him
in the seventh level

32:25.710 --> 32:28.508
of the Inferno,
reserved for suicides.

32:28.540 --> 32:31.976
Like Judas Iscariot,
he died by hanging.

32:32.010 --> 32:36.014
Judas and Pietro della Vigna
are linked in Dante's Inferno.

32:36.050 --> 32:39.349
Betrayal, hanging...

32:39.390 --> 32:42.279
then, linked
since antiquity,

32:42.320 --> 32:44.424
the image appearing
again and again in art.

32:44.460 --> 32:48.248
This is the earliest
known depiction

32:48.300 --> 32:51.599
of the Crucifixion, carved
on an ivory box in Gaul

32:51.630 --> 32:55.430
about A.D. four hundred. It
includes the death by hanging

32:55.470 --> 33:00.760
of Judas, his face upturned to
the branch that suspends him.

33:00.810 --> 33:02.573
On the doors of
the Benevento Cathedral,

33:02.610 --> 33:05.204
we see Judas hanging
with his bowels falling out.

33:05.250 --> 33:09.038
And here, from a
fifteenth-century edition

33:09.080 --> 33:11.719
of The Inferno, is
Pietro della Vigna's body

33:11.750 --> 33:14.685
hanging from a bleeding tree.

33:14.720 --> 33:17.587
I won't belabor the parallels
with Judas Iscariot.

33:17.620 --> 33:20.350
Betrayal, hanging,
self-destruction.

33:20.390 --> 33:24.065
"Io fei gibetto a me
de le mie case."

33:26.600 --> 33:30.092
"I make my own home
be my gallows."

33:30.140 --> 33:34.236
- Mr. Dimmond. Welcome.
Please jom us.

33:34.280 --> 33:36.635
We were just about to discuss
the matter of chewing in Dante.

33:43.850 --> 33:46.080
(applause)

33:52.090 --> 33:54.593
Thank you for
your kind attention.

33:54.630 --> 33:57.724
Thank you.

34:05.340 --> 34:08.571
Would you say I secured
my position, Professor Sogliato?

34:08.610 --> 34:12.671
- The Studiolo
seem... satisfied.

34:12.710 --> 34:15.349
- Satisfied?

34:15.380 --> 34:17.348
I thought the applause
was downright enthusiastic

34:17.380 --> 34:20.713
in its soft and dusty way.

34:20.750 --> 34:23.150
- Dottore Fell is
a friend of yours?

34:23.190 --> 34:27.388
- I was his TA at Cambridge.
The tales I could tell.

34:29.430 --> 34:31.694
- Please do.

34:31.730 --> 34:37.362
- What kind of friend
would I be?

34:37.400 --> 34:40.608
- What kind of friend, indeed.

34:40.640 --> 34:43.734
Dottore.

35:02.160 --> 35:05.197
- An exposition of Atrocious
Torture Instruments

35:05.230 --> 35:08.165
appeals to connoisseurs
of the very worst in mankind.

35:08.200 --> 35:11.636
- Now that
ceaseless exposure

35:11.670 --> 35:14.173
has calloused us into
the lewd and the vulgar,

35:14.210 --> 35:17.600
it is instructive to see
what still seems wicked to us.

35:17.640 --> 35:19.005
- What still slaps
the clammy flab

35:24.950 --> 35:28.784
- What wickedness has
your attention, Mr. Dimmond?

35:28.820 --> 35:32.221
- Yours...

35:32.260 --> 35:34.558
"Dr. Fell."

35:36.400 --> 35:39.790
I have no delusions
about moraIIty;

35:39.830 --> 35:42.390
ifI did, I would've
gone to la polizia .

35:42.440 --> 35:45.364
I'm curious
as to what fate

35:45.410 --> 35:47.207
befell Dr. Fell

35:47.240 --> 35:51.244
to see you here
in his stead.

35:53.480 --> 35:55.539
- You may have to strap me
to the breaking wheel

35:55.580 --> 35:58.481
to loosen my tongue.
- You overestimate

35:58.520 --> 36:00.886
my affection for
the genuine Dr. Fell.

36:00.920 --> 36:06.529
Clearly, you found him
as distasteful as I did.

36:06.560 --> 36:09.597
- On the contrary.

36:13.700 --> 36:16.931
- We_ can twist
ourselves Into all manner

36:16.970 --> 36:20.462
of uncomfortable positions
just to maintain appearances,

36:20.510 --> 36:23.399
with or without
a breaking wheel.

36:26.380 --> 36:29.645
- Are you here to twist me
into an uncomfortable position?

36:29.680 --> 36:32.649
- I'm hereto
help you untWIst...

36:32.690 --> 36:35.784
to our mutual benefit.

37:16.300 --> 37:19.997
(Thump!)

37:20.030 --> 37:24.660
(panﬁng)

37:24.710 --> 37:29.534
- Observe or participate?

37:33.910 --> 37:36.777
- What?

37:36.820 --> 37:37.844
- Are you,

37:37.880 --> 37:40.440
in this very moment,
observing or participating?

37:42.620 --> 37:44.349
- Observing.

37:47.560 --> 37:50.620
- You say you're
observing, but this...

37:50.660 --> 37:53.322
this is
participation, Bedelia.

37:53.370 --> 37:55.964
Did you know
what he would do?

38:01.380 --> 38:04.304
I would prefer
you answer honestly.

38:04.350 --> 38:06.705
- I was curious.
- You were curIous

38:06.750 --> 38:09.310
what would happen.

38:09.350 --> 38:12.012
You were curious
what Mr. Dimmond would do.

38:12.050 --> 38:15.383
What I would do.

38:17.690 --> 38:20.523
Did you anticipate
our thoughts?

38:20.560 --> 38:23.757
Counter-thoughts?
Rationalizations?

38:23.800 --> 38:26.428
- Yes.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.865
- Is this
what you expected?

38:36.080 --> 38:38.071
- Yes.

38:40.480 --> 38:43.074
- That's participation.

38:45.720 --> 38:48.359
(panting and moaning)

38:52.790 --> 38:56.624
(loud cracking)

39:06.710 --> 39:08.507
- What have you gotten
yourself into, Bedelia?

39:10.710 --> 39:12.439
Shall I hang up your coat?

40:29.960 --> 40:31.450
Would you rather I extended you

40:31.490 --> 40:34.857
the same kindness
as the escargot?

40:34.900 --> 40:38.688
- Eating me
without my knowledge?

40:40.030 --> 40:43.090
Well... I find knowing
to be far more powerful.

40:45.510 --> 40:48.502
Why do you think
I'm allowing this?

40:48.540 --> 40:51.668
- Why do you think
'I'm' allowing this?

40:51.710 --> 40:54.918
- 'Cause snails aren't
the only creatures

40:54.950 --> 40:58.044
who prefer eating with company.

41:00.250 --> 41:03.014
If only that company
could be Will Graham.

41:22.680 --> 41:24.477
(dropped utensil clinking)

41:29.680 --> 41:31.944
I'm just fascinated
to know how you will feel

41:31.990 --> 41:35.619
when all of this...

41:35.660 --> 41:38.584
happens to you.

42:29.640 --> 42:33.098
