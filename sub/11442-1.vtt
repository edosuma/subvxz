00:57.007 --> 00:59.396
One, two, three,
knock on the wall!

01:01.847 --> 01:04.202
One, two, three,
knock on the wall!

02:00.367 --> 02:02.676
Good Shepherd Orphanage, hello?

02:05.087 --> 02:06.315
It's all ready.

02:06.807 --> 02:09.560
She's playing.
We haven't told her yet.

02:11.887 --> 02:15.118
She'll be happy in her new home.
Don't worry.

02:17.127 --> 02:18.162
See you then.

02:42.167 --> 02:45.239
Your friends
will miss you a lot, Laura.

02:52.447 --> 02:53.163
Got you!

03:48.327 --> 03:51.205
THE ORPHANAGE

04:01.967 --> 04:03.161
Mummy!

04:10.687 --> 04:13.155
I'll go, it's my turn.

04:18.367 --> 04:19.641
I'm coming!

04:39.327 --> 04:40.476
Simon!

04:41.367 --> 04:43.323
They're outside.
Listen.

04:47.527 --> 04:49.006
Go to sleep.

04:51.527 --> 04:53.404
Simon, darling.

04:54.767 --> 04:55.995
Oh, I see!

04:56.167 --> 04:58.556
Watson and Pepe
have played very late,

04:58.727 --> 05:00.718
now they can't get in?

05:02.407 --> 05:03.886
Come on, in you go.

05:06.607 --> 05:08.882
Aren't you
a bit old for this?

05:09.287 --> 05:12.359
Weren't you scared here,
when you were little?

05:12.767 --> 05:15.565
You couldn't be afraid.
There was a gang of us,

05:15.887 --> 05:17.525
and there was the lighthouse...

05:17.687 --> 05:19.120
-Lighthouse?
-It's still there,

05:19.287 --> 05:21.164
but it doesn't work anymore.

05:21.327 --> 05:23.158
I'll show you tomorrow.

05:23.327 --> 05:24.840
Why doesn't it work?

05:29.607 --> 05:31.404
Can you keep a secret?

05:32.727 --> 05:35.082
Actually, it does work.

05:35.607 --> 05:38.405
But the light's invisible,
it protects us.

05:38.567 --> 05:39.966
Invisible light?

05:40.967 --> 05:42.559
OK, try this.

05:43.007 --> 05:45.123
Look at the window, over there.

05:46.167 --> 05:47.282
Don't move.

05:56.927 --> 05:58.121
See it?

06:00.887 --> 06:02.366
Did you see it?

06:03.007 --> 06:04.599
Those kids that are coming,

06:04.927 --> 06:07.441
why can't they stay at home?

06:07.607 --> 06:09.563
They're special children,

06:09.727 --> 06:12.400
and they need
a lot of special care.

06:12.567 --> 06:14.603
They can't come and go,
they need a home.

06:14.767 --> 06:16.086
You understand?

06:18.127 --> 06:19.685
Can I sleep with you tonight?

06:23.727 --> 06:26.002
You're pushing it, kiddo!

07:19.247 --> 07:21.397
Dad, are you coming to the beach?

07:21.567 --> 07:23.285
Aren't Watson and Pepe going?

07:23.447 --> 07:26.200
No, they didn't sleep
a wink last night.

07:27.327 --> 07:30.524
You're such a smartass!
Friends only when it suits.

07:30.967 --> 07:32.844
OK, wise guy, take your pill.

07:38.687 --> 07:39.722
''S'' for Simon!

07:42.287 --> 07:45.757
Go upstairs and get your bag.
Dad'll meet us there later.

07:49.367 --> 07:51.801
One of us should talk to him.

07:53.327 --> 07:54.806
About his invisible friends.

07:55.287 --> 07:58.404
He's lonely, he's bored.
It's normal.

07:58.567 --> 08:01.843
He'll forget them
as soon as the real kids arrive.

08:11.807 --> 08:13.479
Everything will work out.

08:13.647 --> 08:15.717
We'll have a great home.

08:17.567 --> 08:19.922
I'm so glad we're here together.

08:29.407 --> 08:30.601
Pirate.

08:31.407 --> 08:32.556
Cave.

08:33.607 --> 08:34.756
And lighthouse.

08:35.327 --> 08:39.285
Once upon a time there was
a very, very bad pirate

08:39.447 --> 08:42.803
who hid his treasures
in a cave, near a lighthouse.

08:42.967 --> 08:45.242
-What treasures?
-Stolen treasures.

08:45.407 --> 08:47.716
But it wasn't easy
to get into the cave.

08:48.527 --> 08:50.040
How did they get in?

08:50.207 --> 08:53.040
They'd click a stone
in a gap in the rocks...

10:19.527 --> 10:20.755
Simon!

10:24.527 --> 10:26.085
Simon, come on!

10:42.007 --> 10:43.565
What's your name?

10:44.687 --> 10:47.759
I'm Simon.
Do you want to play?

10:49.487 --> 10:51.079
Why can't you play?

10:53.847 --> 10:56.839
Do you want to come to my house
to play later?

10:59.567 --> 11:01.000
What are you doing?

11:01.167 --> 11:02.202
Playing.

11:02.367 --> 11:04.164
But Watson and Pepe
didn't come.

11:04.327 --> 11:05.646
It's another boy.

11:05.927 --> 11:08.157
He shouldn't play here.
It's dangerous.

11:08.327 --> 11:09.601
Come on, let's go.

11:13.927 --> 11:16.122
Can he come home to play?

11:54.967 --> 11:56.685
Why are you dropping shells?

11:56.847 --> 12:00.044
It's a path
for my friend to follow

12:00.207 --> 12:01.640
so he can come and play.

12:01.807 --> 12:04.605
-He made a new friend. How's that?
-Another one?

12:04.767 --> 12:07.679
We won't have room
for all these kids.

12:38.007 --> 12:38.757
Good afternoon.

12:39.207 --> 12:41.198
Sorry I didn't call

12:41.367 --> 12:44.086
but I couldn't get your number.

12:44.927 --> 12:46.804
Benigna Escobedo.

12:47.447 --> 12:49.324
I'm a social worker.

12:51.167 --> 12:52.646
I'm sorry you've come so far

12:52.807 --> 12:54.718
but there are no interviews today.

12:54.887 --> 12:55.683
Interviews?

12:55.847 --> 12:59.078
No, I'm here for Simon.

13:03.687 --> 13:05.166
What a sitting room!

13:05.687 --> 13:07.643
It's a beautiful house.

13:08.607 --> 13:10.404
How did you find it?

13:11.207 --> 13:13.767
I grew up here.
It was an orphanage.

13:14.007 --> 13:16.567
I wanted to return,
so I thought of the home.

13:16.727 --> 13:17.955
Home?

13:18.607 --> 13:21.167
For special children.
That's not why you came?

13:21.327 --> 13:24.319
You'll need a lot of people
for that.

13:24.487 --> 13:25.886
It's not that kind of a home.

13:26.367 --> 13:29.723
We'll be happy
with 5 or 6 children.

13:29.967 --> 13:32.322
More would be too complicated.

13:35.487 --> 13:36.806
What about Simon?

13:38.247 --> 13:39.600
Yes, of course!

13:40.847 --> 13:42.405
I received his file yesterday

13:43.287 --> 13:45.926
and thought:
''I should visit them,

13:46.087 --> 13:48.521
in case they need anything.''

13:50.247 --> 13:51.839
Will you make many changes?

13:52.487 --> 13:55.285
Sorry, I don't understand
why you're here.

14:04.527 --> 14:05.960
This information's old.

14:06.127 --> 14:07.799
I know, but I received it.

14:08.807 --> 14:11.879
There are new treatments,
an experimental program

14:12.047 --> 14:16.040
that requires an application,
You might be interested.

14:17.047 --> 14:18.446
My husband is a doctor.

14:18.927 --> 14:22.442
We're aware of all treatments
for Simon's disease.

14:23.407 --> 14:25.284
Now please leave.

14:25.447 --> 14:28.519
Simon doesn't know he's adopted,
or about his illness,

14:28.807 --> 14:31.685
and I'd rather deal with it
with my husband.

14:40.767 --> 14:43.998
CHANGE OF RESIDENCE

14:45.327 --> 14:47.602
HIV POSITIVE

15:51.087 --> 15:52.315
Carlos.

15:54.167 --> 15:56.601
I'll go. It's my turn.

16:14.127 --> 16:15.526
Who's there?

17:39.927 --> 17:40.564
What are you doing?

17:56.927 --> 17:58.121
Carlos!

17:59.647 --> 18:00.443
What is it?

18:06.247 --> 18:09.000
Planning to bash
the old lady's head in?

18:25.007 --> 18:26.918
Sleep with Simon tonight.

18:27.287 --> 18:30.643
If she shows up again,
we'll call the cops.

18:43.087 --> 18:44.839
Can I wake up?

18:46.207 --> 18:47.799
Can I wake up?

18:58.807 --> 19:00.445
You are awake.

19:01.287 --> 19:03.084
You can get up now.

20:06.967 --> 20:08.798
Wendy gets old and dies?

20:08.967 --> 20:12.960
Wendy gets old, but Peter Pan
takes her daughter to Neverland.

20:13.447 --> 20:15.244
Why doesn't Wendy go too?

20:18.327 --> 20:21.080
If Peter Pan came to get me,
would you come too?

20:22.407 --> 20:24.796
I'm too old to go to Neverland.

20:24.967 --> 20:27.356
-How old are you?
-37.

20:29.367 --> 20:31.085
At what age will you die?

20:33.127 --> 20:35.038
What sort of question is that?

20:36.007 --> 20:38.316
Not for a long time,
when you're much older.

20:39.207 --> 20:41.198
I won't get older.

20:41.847 --> 20:42.996
I'm not going to grow up.

20:46.567 --> 20:48.239
Like Peter Pan?

20:48.487 --> 20:50.000
Like my new friends.

20:52.887 --> 20:55.037
-There's more than one?
-Six.

20:55.207 --> 20:58.005
-They won't grow up either?
-They can't.

21:32.087 --> 21:34.237
What are they holding?

21:34.407 --> 21:36.398
Treasures. To play with.

21:37.287 --> 21:39.357
Your friends play together?

21:39.527 --> 21:40.118
Sure.

21:40.527 --> 21:42.006
They steal your treasure,

21:42.167 --> 21:45.045
something you love,
and you have to find it.

21:45.567 --> 21:47.797
That's the game?
Finding treasure?

21:47.967 --> 21:49.878
Yes, but following the clues.

21:50.087 --> 21:52.999
If you find it,
they grant you a wish.

21:53.167 --> 21:53.758
Well now.

21:54.767 --> 21:56.678
And you have a treasure?

21:56.847 --> 21:58.360
Special coins.

21:58.527 --> 22:01.644
An old man left them in the park.
I think they're gold

22:02.287 --> 22:04.005
and very valuable.

22:04.567 --> 22:06.046
Want to see them?

22:13.007 --> 22:13.837
Don't look yet.

22:17.047 --> 22:19.607
-Where'd you get all this?
-I found it.

22:20.287 --> 22:21.003
What's this?

22:21.447 --> 22:25.326
The first ice cream I had
after my tonsils operation.

22:28.447 --> 22:30.199
The special coins.

22:31.927 --> 22:34.122
They're not coins,
they're milk teeth.

22:34.367 --> 22:36.244
-Where'd you find them?
-See?

22:36.407 --> 22:39.717
They're the first clue.
They've got my coins.

22:40.967 --> 22:43.003
You want to play treasure hunt?

22:43.607 --> 22:44.881
The game's started.

22:45.047 --> 22:47.607
Remember where you kept
my milk teeth.

22:47.767 --> 22:51.237
If I find my treasure,
I can make a wish.

23:02.727 --> 23:04.877
Sand.
Where do you find sand?

23:05.727 --> 23:07.604
You set this up, right?

23:10.047 --> 23:12.277
-The beach?
-No, it has to be at home.

23:26.727 --> 23:27.842
What's this?

23:29.927 --> 23:31.360
The sewing box!

23:33.527 --> 23:34.323
Simon, wait!

23:49.447 --> 23:50.846
Come on, hurry up!

24:13.527 --> 24:15.006
This rings a bell.

24:15.407 --> 24:17.557
The key in the kitchen!

24:27.327 --> 24:28.442
Those are Daddy's...

24:28.607 --> 24:30.086
I can make a wish!

24:30.887 --> 24:32.400
Leave that alone!

24:33.927 --> 24:36.964
Those are our things,
you shouldn't touch them.

24:37.127 --> 24:39.004
I didn't. It was them!

24:40.087 --> 24:42.203
-Don't lie to me.
-I'm not lying.

24:42.367 --> 24:44.756
You're lying!
You say you're my mother,

24:44.927 --> 24:46.679
and you're not!

24:48.887 --> 24:51.037
-What?
-You're not my mother.

24:51.567 --> 24:53.842
-Who told you that?
-My friend told me.

24:54.007 --> 24:55.235
-What friend?
-Tomas.

24:55.407 --> 24:58.080
Tomas said I'm just like them,

24:58.247 --> 25:00.886
I have no mother or father.
And I'm going to die.

25:01.367 --> 25:04.006
You're not my mother,
you're a liar!

25:19.487 --> 25:23.480
We wanted you to be a bit older
to talk about certain things.

25:24.327 --> 25:26.522
If you want to ask us anything...

25:28.647 --> 25:31.719
Is Father Christmas a lie too?

25:33.407 --> 25:34.635
Simon...

25:34.967 --> 25:36.525
You heard Mummy
and that lady,

25:36.847 --> 25:39.042
saw the envelope
and invented the game

25:39.207 --> 25:42.085
because you were afraid
to ask about it.

25:43.847 --> 25:45.724
What if I don't take them?

25:46.087 --> 25:47.645
Nothing would happen.

25:49.047 --> 25:52.357
If I don't take them,
how soon would I die?

25:52.887 --> 25:55.720
It would take many days,
even weeks.

25:56.207 --> 26:00.200
Don't worry, we'll take care of you.
You won't get sick or die.

26:01.447 --> 26:02.562
OK?

26:20.327 --> 26:22.204
You don't love me!
It's a lie!

26:26.727 --> 26:27.716
Come down, son!

26:47.127 --> 26:49.357
Hurry, the first kids are here!
Come on!

26:49.527 --> 26:52.280
We can't go yet.
I want to show you something.

26:52.567 --> 26:55.127
-What is it?
-Tomas' little house.

26:55.287 --> 26:57.562
Not now, darling.
You can show me tomorrow.

26:57.727 --> 26:58.318
No!

26:59.367 --> 27:01.119
-Not now, Simon.
-Now!

27:01.767 --> 27:03.280
Go downstairs right now!

27:03.447 --> 27:04.880
I don't want to!

27:05.047 --> 27:06.958
Come and see Tomas' house.

27:12.327 --> 27:14.761
If you don't want
to go downstairs, don't.

27:16.167 --> 27:17.725
No one is forcing you.

27:22.207 --> 27:24.004
WELCOME

28:52.367 --> 28:53.561
Darling!

29:49.967 --> 29:51.320
Simon, son.

30:34.407 --> 30:35.726
What's going on?

30:35.967 --> 30:37.082
Darling!

31:59.047 --> 32:00.002
Darling!

32:27.167 --> 32:28.236
He's over there, Carlos!

32:28.647 --> 32:30.365
There's no one, Laura!
Come on.

32:30.847 --> 32:33.361
There's no one!
We can't stay here!

32:33.527 --> 32:35.995
He's there, Carlos!

33:09.727 --> 33:11.080
Carlos is here.

33:11.407 --> 33:15.400
He spoke to the police,
and they want to talk to you.

33:23.567 --> 33:24.682
How are you?

33:26.967 --> 33:28.923
He's not in the caves.

33:29.327 --> 33:31.079
But I saw someone, Carlos.

33:31.967 --> 33:33.559
You must have imagined it,

33:33.727 --> 33:35.285
in all the confusion.

33:35.447 --> 33:37.677
Believe me, he wasn't there.

33:39.287 --> 33:39.924
I'm Pilar.

33:42.447 --> 33:46.440
I know it's hard, but you must know
we're doing all we can

33:46.887 --> 33:48.764
to locate your son.

33:48.927 --> 33:50.121
Pilar is a psychologist.

33:50.287 --> 33:52.118
She works with the police.

33:52.327 --> 33:54.602
They're working hard to find Simon.

33:54.767 --> 33:56.359
I have a few questions.

33:58.727 --> 34:02.117
Your husband told me
about the adoption,

34:02.367 --> 34:04.085
and your son's illness.

34:04.847 --> 34:06.678
As he was adopted,

34:06.847 --> 34:08.882
There are possibilities
we must consider.

34:09.847 --> 34:10.835
What possibilities?

34:11.007 --> 34:14.204
That he has been kidnapped
by a relative.

34:15.567 --> 34:17.637
I heard you recently found

34:17.806 --> 34:19.478
a woman intruder
in the grounds.

34:20.447 --> 34:22.244
Benigna Escobedo, a social worker,

34:22.687 --> 34:24.359
came a few days ago.

34:24.527 --> 34:26.597
We can find no social worker

34:26.766 --> 34:28.120
with that name.

34:29.047 --> 34:30.480
Could you describe her?

34:34.327 --> 34:37.637
She was about seventy,
with white hair,

34:39.047 --> 34:42.083
pale eyes, very thick glasses.

34:44.367 --> 34:46.197
We will find her.

34:47.167 --> 34:48.725
You can be sure of that.

35:15.287 --> 35:18.199
How can they trust me
with their kids after this?

35:24.887 --> 35:26.286
Let's do something.

35:26.447 --> 35:29.007
Wear my grandmother's
Saint Anthony medal.

35:30.407 --> 35:32.637
To bring us good luck.

35:34.127 --> 35:35.526
You don't believe that.

35:35.687 --> 35:37.723
Exactly. But you do.

35:38.767 --> 35:40.485
Take it now.

35:40.727 --> 35:42.399
Give it back when we find Simon.

38:00.607 --> 38:04.600
<i>Simon Sanchez's parents</i>
<i>feel more and more forsaken.</i>

38:05.287 --> 38:07.926
<i>The 7-year-old boy disappeared</i>

38:08.087 --> 38:10.760
<i>from his home 6 months ago.</i>

38:10.927 --> 38:13.202
<i>The situation</i>
<i>is even more desperate</i>

38:13.367 --> 38:17.076
<i>because Simon is ill</i>
<i>and needs daily medication.</i>

38:17.687 --> 38:19.564
My son disappeared 6 months ago.

38:20.847 --> 38:22.326
His name is Simon.

38:27.247 --> 38:30.956
There are posters everywhere.
You may have seen them.

38:31.767 --> 38:33.280
We've tried everything,

38:34.247 --> 38:35.475
but not one clue,

38:36.767 --> 38:38.359
not even a trace.

38:47.447 --> 38:50.007
My son had imaginary friends.

38:55.767 --> 38:58.122
We never paid much attention but...

39:03.767 --> 39:06.406
I have the feeling
they're in the house.

39:11.647 --> 39:12.636
I saw my daughter.

39:15.807 --> 39:17.843
A year after her death.

39:23.087 --> 39:25.282
It was at night, we were asleep.

39:28.327 --> 39:29.885
I woke up and,

39:30.887 --> 39:33.879
without knowing why,
I went to her room.

39:40.327 --> 39:41.999
And there she was.

39:46.527 --> 39:48.518
Smiling. Calm.

39:53.127 --> 39:55.925
It was her way of telling me:

39:57.087 --> 39:59.203
''I'm fine, I'm safe,

40:01.607 --> 40:03.325
don't suffer for me.''

40:05.287 --> 40:08.996
It is not unusual to feel,
in some way,

40:10.047 --> 40:12.686
the presence of a loved one
after their death.

40:13.647 --> 40:15.524
All of us in this group

40:15.687 --> 40:18.042
could tell you similar stories.

40:30.887 --> 40:32.479
You don't understand.

40:33.967 --> 40:35.798
My son is not dead.

40:36.887 --> 40:39.879
His friends took him.
I saw one of them.

40:40.887 --> 40:42.286
He was at home.

40:43.327 --> 40:45.761
I'll do whatever it takes
to recover my son.

40:47.447 --> 40:48.516
I'm not crazy,

40:49.447 --> 40:50.323
believe me.

40:52.727 --> 40:54.319
I know what I'm saying.

41:56.967 --> 41:57.797
It's her.

41:58.287 --> 42:00.562
The woman who came to the house.

42:02.167 --> 42:03.441
Benigna?

42:26.087 --> 42:27.600
Simon!

43:45.687 --> 43:48.838
We went to Benigna's house.
We found some pictures

43:49.007 --> 43:50.645
and old Super 8 films.

43:51.167 --> 43:53.283
I'd like you to see them.

43:55.087 --> 43:57.362
Are any of the faces familiar?

43:59.007 --> 44:01.680
Antonia, the principal, the orphans.

44:02.007 --> 44:03.440
My friends.

44:04.247 --> 44:06.715
Martin.
She liked to be called Martin.

44:07.207 --> 44:07.844
Rita.

44:08.807 --> 44:11.640
Victor...
I think his name was Guillermo.

44:11.807 --> 44:14.241
That's Alicia, she was blind.

44:15.167 --> 44:16.043
And this is me.

44:21.687 --> 44:22.563
Benigna?

44:22.727 --> 44:24.558
The woman you saw

44:24.727 --> 44:27.082
worked at the orphanage.

44:32.887 --> 44:35.037
That's impossible. I'd remember!

44:35.207 --> 44:37.482
She wasn't there very long.

44:40.927 --> 44:43.122
She had a son. Tomas.

44:43.807 --> 44:46.958
The child was deformed,

44:47.407 --> 44:49.967
he was kept away from the others.

44:50.207 --> 44:51.799
No one knew.

44:53.607 --> 44:56.758
It was a total shock
when they found the body.

44:57.927 --> 44:58.757
What do you mean?

44:59.687 --> 45:02.918
It seems he disappeared while playing.

45:03.207 --> 45:05.277
CHILD'S BODY FOUND ON BEACH

45:05.447 --> 45:07.438
Shortly after your adoption.

45:07.927 --> 45:09.758
One of the orphans confessed

45:10.887 --> 45:12.798
that they had played
a trick on him.

45:12.967 --> 45:15.083
They went into the caves
with Tomas

45:15.647 --> 45:18.605
and took his mask off
to see if he'd come out.

45:19.527 --> 45:22.246
But he never emerged.
He drowned.

45:22.407 --> 45:24.682
They found his body at low tide.

45:26.247 --> 45:29.603
The children weren't blamed.
They were only playing.

45:33.087 --> 45:34.406
That boy was in my house.

45:35.127 --> 45:38.039
We asked everyone
at the opening party.

45:38.607 --> 45:41.599
No one remembers a child
with a sack mask.

47:13.807 --> 47:16.480
I can't sleep through the night.

47:20.047 --> 47:21.924
I can't stop thinking.

47:29.727 --> 47:32.446
Remember what we called Simon
when we met him?

47:32.607 --> 47:34.086
''Two Little Kilos''.

47:37.167 --> 47:40.159
''My two little extra kilos''.
That's all he weighed.

47:45.007 --> 47:47.919
The doctors said it wasn't enough.

47:49.887 --> 47:52.720
But it was plenty for us.

47:57.247 --> 47:58.919
Although we knew

48:00.327 --> 48:04.081
there was little chance
he could ever be normal.

48:06.847 --> 48:08.678
But when we saw him,

48:11.727 --> 48:14.195
saw his smile for the first time...

48:15.247 --> 48:17.238
his eyes, his bright eyes...

48:21.847 --> 48:24.202
Simon made us strong, Carlos.

48:27.407 --> 48:29.363
Together, we're strong.

48:30.727 --> 48:31.876
Together.

48:33.727 --> 48:37.197
Forgive me if I get upset,
but it's hard.

48:50.287 --> 48:52.323
Carlos, someone's in the bathroom.

49:12.207 --> 49:14.118
-What is it?
-Someone was here.

49:18.807 --> 49:20.798
Carlos, feel, it's still warm.

49:20.967 --> 49:23.276
Sure, I just got up.

49:24.887 --> 49:26.559
Someone got into bed.

49:27.007 --> 49:28.486
I'm convinced.

49:34.527 --> 49:37.280
That's what Jung means when he says

49:37.447 --> 49:39.836
it's in the subconscious that

49:40.007 --> 49:42.396
the living coexist with the dead.

49:43.887 --> 49:47.846
The Germans have another name
for ''the herald of death''.

49:48.007 --> 49:49.440
Doppelganger.

49:49.807 --> 49:53.197
A being that appears
in one's own image.

49:54.607 --> 49:56.006
A double.

49:56.607 --> 49:58.006
To glance at him,

49:58.167 --> 50:01.557
or at any of the others
I've shown you,

50:02.647 --> 50:05.207
means, without the slightest doubt,

50:06.367 --> 50:09.484
a passport to the otherworld.

50:10.847 --> 50:13.441
How long has your son been missing?

50:13.847 --> 50:15.246
Nine months.

50:17.847 --> 50:21.840
Strange things are happening.
Things linked to his disappearance.

50:24.247 --> 50:25.919
I don't know who to turn to.

50:26.087 --> 50:27.361
It's not that simple.

50:27.527 --> 50:31.076
You won't find an exorcist
in the yellow pages.

50:37.487 --> 50:39.159
This is from my son's kidnapper.

50:41.167 --> 50:44.284
The police say he's been dead
for over 30 years.

50:45.767 --> 50:46.882
Someone has my son.

50:47.567 --> 50:51.082
I don't know why.
But I won't do nothing.

50:52.847 --> 50:56.237
There's someone in this field,
someone I trust.

50:57.367 --> 50:59.642
I'm talking from the heart.

51:01.167 --> 51:04.045
Would you allow a medium
to visit your home?

51:29.927 --> 51:33.397
This wasn't a children's room
in the orphanage.

51:33.567 --> 51:35.842
The bedroom was back there.

51:38.127 --> 51:40.357
Then we should start here.

51:40.527 --> 51:41.596
Enrique.

51:41.767 --> 51:42.404
Perfect,

51:42.567 --> 51:43.966
give me an hour.

51:45.847 --> 51:48.520
I want an old object
from this house,

51:48.687 --> 51:52.202
something related to its history.
And, if possible,

51:52.767 --> 51:54.962
some clothing from the past.

51:58.367 --> 51:59.880
We're not alone.

52:05.247 --> 52:07.807
There's a police psychologist, Pilar,

52:07.967 --> 52:11.437
who would like to attend the session.

52:11.807 --> 52:13.684
If you don't mind.

52:14.927 --> 52:17.043
Cops! The cops is cool!

52:34.047 --> 52:36.686
What does she need that doll for?

52:36.927 --> 52:39.521
To facilitate her trance.

52:40.087 --> 52:41.918
Clothing and objects
get her into it

52:42.887 --> 52:44.639
and begin the regression.

52:44.807 --> 52:47.037
-Regression?
-A psychic summoning.

52:47.407 --> 52:50.763
Past, present and future
are superimposed, and cross.

52:50.927 --> 52:52.360
Like a sort of time travel.

52:54.207 --> 52:56.004
It may sound like witchcraft,

52:56.167 --> 52:58.635
but you mustn't fear
parallel perception.

52:59.047 --> 53:01.607
If there's anything,
Aurora will see it.

53:02.007 --> 53:04.567
I hope we'll all see it.

53:06.767 --> 53:08.519
<i>Everything's ready, Enrique.</i>

53:12.967 --> 53:14.082
Whenever you want.

53:34.527 --> 53:36.722
-Aurora, can you hear me?
<i>-Perfectly.</i>

53:36.887 --> 53:38.206
Here we go.

53:45.807 --> 53:49.436
Everything around you
is beginning to fade.

53:50.287 --> 53:54.246
Darkness is forming
a circle around you,

53:54.567 --> 53:56.922
it's closing in on you.

53:57.927 --> 54:01.237
Everything is fading.
We're no longer here.

54:01.927 --> 54:05.442
Now you're alone
in the darkness,

54:06.847 --> 54:09.964
and the darkness
begins to disappear.

54:11.447 --> 54:13.403
I'm going to count down

54:14.047 --> 54:15.799
from ten

54:16.047 --> 54:17.639
and once I've finished,

54:18.007 --> 54:21.044
you can go
wherever you want

54:21.687 --> 54:23.564
and will be able to see

54:23.807 --> 54:27.686
anyone who is hiding in this house.

54:29.407 --> 54:30.726
Ten...

54:32.007 --> 54:33.235
Nine...

54:34.287 --> 54:35.436
Eight...

54:51.727 --> 54:53.046
You can open your eyes.

55:03.047 --> 55:04.526
<i>It's cold,</i>

55:06.607 --> 55:08.325
<i>the window is open.</i>

55:18.047 --> 55:18.843
Aurora,

55:19.327 --> 55:20.885
I want you
to look around you.

55:21.367 --> 55:23.005
Is there anyone with you?

55:25.167 --> 55:26.441
<i>I can hear someone.</i>

55:29.367 --> 55:30.197
<i>I can hear...</i>

55:51.647 --> 55:53.000
<i>I hear something.</i>

56:05.167 --> 56:06.441
<i>It comes and goes.</i>

56:16.647 --> 56:18.160
<i>I can't hear it anymore.</i>

56:21.047 --> 56:23.083
<i>I think I've lost them.</i>

56:32.647 --> 56:34.365
<i>I can hear something.</i>

56:39.407 --> 56:40.556
<i>...all alone.</i>

56:43.287 --> 56:44.606
<i>Children,</i>

56:44.767 --> 56:46.439
<i>I'm sure it's children.</i>

56:49.647 --> 56:52.923
<i>At the end of the hall.</i>
<i>I think it's them.</i>

57:10.327 --> 57:11.521
<i>I can't open it.</i>

57:12.367 --> 57:13.766
<i>It's closed.</i>

57:17.487 --> 57:18.966
<i>But there's someone.</i>

57:21.287 --> 57:23.084
<i>Why are you crying?</i>

57:23.767 --> 57:26.884
<i>-We're sick!</i>
-Who's sick?

57:27.887 --> 57:29.559
<i>I won't hurt you.</i>

57:29.727 --> 57:33.163
<i>Open the door.</i>
<i>Don't be afraid.</i>

57:34.207 --> 57:35.196
<i>Open the door.</i>

57:35.367 --> 57:38.803
<i>We want you to open the door!</i>

57:53.607 --> 57:55.199
<i>What have they done to you?</i>

57:58.007 --> 57:59.565
<i>What have they done?</i>

58:04.327 --> 58:05.157
Aurora,

58:05.327 --> 58:07.397
tell me what you see.

58:08.087 --> 58:09.440
<i>Five children.</i>

58:09.647 --> 58:12.525
<i>They're very sick.</i>
<i>They're crying.</i>

58:15.047 --> 58:16.526
<i>What happened?</i>

58:20.927 --> 58:21.962
<i>They're dying.</i>

58:22.127 --> 58:24.277
<i>Who would want to poison you?</i>

58:30.087 --> 58:31.486
<i>Someone's going to kill us.</i>

58:32.407 --> 58:33.476
Is my son there?

58:34.687 --> 58:36.359
Aurora, is Simon with you?

58:39.127 --> 58:41.436
<i>Is Simon here?</i>

58:58.647 --> 59:00.717
Aurora, can you hear me?

59:01.607 --> 59:02.403
Let's get her.

59:02.807 --> 59:05.879
Aurora, stay in the middle
of the room.

59:06.047 --> 59:07.241
I'll count from ten.

59:08.087 --> 59:08.724
Ten...

59:10.007 --> 59:10.837
Nine...

59:11.287 --> 59:11.878
Eight...

59:34.847 --> 59:37.236
I was in the house, but...

59:38.167 --> 59:39.600
everything was different.

59:39.767 --> 59:43.362
The beds, the toys, the decor,
everything was much older.

59:45.447 --> 59:49.042
The light from the lighthouse
came through the windows.

59:52.087 --> 59:53.918
You didn't see Simon?

59:55.687 --> 59:57.086
It was too dark,
I'm sorry.

59:57.567 --> 59:59.523
I couldn't recognize anyone.

59:59.927 --> 01:00:01.280
But the children were there.

01:00:01.447 --> 01:00:03.756
You saw the children.
Is that right?

01:00:03.927 --> 01:00:04.518
That's right.

01:00:04.687 --> 01:00:06.518
You're talking about ghosts.

01:00:06.687 --> 01:00:08.803
And what is a ghost, Carlos?

01:00:09.127 --> 01:00:11.641
There's something here,
and we all saw it.

01:00:13.487 --> 01:00:15.796
When something terrible happens,

01:00:16.287 --> 01:00:19.085
sometimes it leaves a trace,

01:00:19.847 --> 01:00:22.077
a wound that acts

01:00:22.607 --> 01:00:24.757
as a knot between two time lines.

01:00:25.647 --> 01:00:28.286
It's like an echo

01:00:28.447 --> 01:00:32.076
repeated over and over,
waiting to be heard.

01:00:32.567 --> 01:00:34.478
Like a scar...

01:00:34.647 --> 01:00:35.841
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:00:36.167 --> 01:00:38.283
Like a scar or a pinch

01:00:39.047 --> 01:00:41.720
that begs for a caress
to relieve it.

01:00:45.127 --> 01:00:46.276
Laura...

01:00:49.407 --> 01:00:53.036
we who are close to death,

01:00:53.207 --> 01:00:56.358
we are more receptive
to these messages.

01:00:59.647 --> 01:01:03.037
You mean my son
could see those children

01:01:06.327 --> 01:01:07.237
because...

01:01:08.727 --> 01:01:10.001
That's enough.

01:01:10.167 --> 01:01:11.998
Please take your things and leave.

01:01:12.967 --> 01:01:14.719
We can't let them go like this.

01:01:14.887 --> 01:01:16.878
Laura, this is a farce,

01:01:17.647 --> 01:01:18.716
a sideshow trick.

01:01:18.887 --> 01:01:21.082
I can't believe this. Why?

01:01:21.447 --> 01:01:24.166
For what reason?
They're right...

01:01:24.327 --> 01:01:26.204
-They don't want money.
-Not yet.

01:01:27.367 --> 01:01:28.641
What should I do?

01:01:28.807 --> 01:01:30.206
What should I do?

01:01:30.367 --> 01:01:33.200
The police haven't found
a single clue

01:01:33.367 --> 01:01:35.927
as to whether he's
dead or alive.

01:01:36.087 --> 01:01:37.918
What do I do,
just sit and wait?

01:01:38.087 --> 01:01:39.440
Can it hurt to listen?

01:01:39.607 --> 01:01:41.165
-Laura, stop!
-No, you stop!

01:01:42.167 --> 01:01:43.236
Pilar...

01:01:43.527 --> 01:01:47.076
How many similar cases
have you had in this damned village?

01:01:48.527 --> 01:01:50.961
Get another distraction,
I didn't invite you here.

01:01:58.527 --> 01:01:59.880
What should I do?

01:02:00.047 --> 01:02:01.002
My dear,

01:02:01.407 --> 01:02:03.477
you are a good mother.

01:02:03.687 --> 01:02:06.724
Your pain gives you strength,
it will guide you.

01:02:08.007 --> 01:02:12.000
But only you know
how far you are willing to go

01:02:12.367 --> 01:02:14.164
to find your son.

01:02:14.487 --> 01:02:15.920
I don't know what to do.

01:02:16.087 --> 01:02:18.203
You hear, but don't listen.

01:02:19.247 --> 01:02:22.080
Seeing is not believing.
It's the other way around.

01:02:24.807 --> 01:02:26.035
Believe,

01:02:27.327 --> 01:02:28.806
and you will see.

01:02:45.087 --> 01:02:46.281
What are you doing?

01:02:56.647 --> 01:02:59.241
We can't stay here any longer.

01:02:59.967 --> 01:03:02.242
We should go,
at least for a while.

01:03:04.767 --> 01:03:08.077
The children are here.
Aurora saw them. I can't leave.

01:03:08.247 --> 01:03:09.566
You heard the voices.

01:03:09.727 --> 01:03:12.480
That Enrique could have faked it all.

01:03:12.647 --> 01:03:15.081
Can't you see it could be a set-up?

01:03:15.327 --> 01:03:17.124
That's Pilar's theory,
a set-up?

01:03:17.847 --> 01:03:20.361
-Her rational theory?
-She's protecting us.

01:03:21.647 --> 01:03:23.000
From what?

01:03:23.167 --> 01:03:24.725
Things like this evening.

01:03:24.887 --> 01:03:27.879
People entering our home
and fucking up our lives.

01:03:28.727 --> 01:03:31.082
-They just want to help.
-Help?

01:03:31.247 --> 01:03:32.885
Didn't you hear them?

01:03:33.367 --> 01:03:35.801
Did they mention finding Simon?

01:03:36.087 --> 01:03:38.237
They just want to contact the dead.

01:03:44.287 --> 01:03:47.996
If Simon's alive,
I can't see how they can help us.

01:03:50.807 --> 01:03:53.241
If he's not,
they won't recover him.

01:03:53.527 --> 01:03:55.961
I don't want to keep
taking this shit.

01:03:56.127 --> 01:03:58.322
Please, let's leave this house.

01:04:01.207 --> 01:04:04.961
You can't ask me to give up.
Neither you nor Pilar.

01:04:06.967 --> 01:04:10.118
We can survive this. Many couples
lose a child and pull through.

01:04:10.287 --> 01:04:13.643
I want to be with Simon,
don't you understand?

01:04:13.807 --> 01:04:17.720
If you want to go, I can't stop you.
I just want to know

01:04:17.887 --> 01:04:19.479
where he is!

01:05:23.247 --> 01:05:24.760
Where are you?

01:05:26.047 --> 01:05:27.366
I'm not afraid.

01:06:33.127 --> 01:06:34.640
You want to play?

01:06:36.487 --> 01:06:38.125
Are you playing with me?

01:08:56.966 --> 01:08:58.366
Benigna?

01:11:01.687 --> 01:11:03.882
Please, don't let it be Simon.

01:12:23.367 --> 01:12:25.437
-There are five, right?
-Yes.

01:12:25.847 --> 01:12:27.360
All my friends.

01:12:27.767 --> 01:12:30.520
Martin, Rita, Alicia,
Guillermo, Victor.

01:12:32.807 --> 01:12:36.117
Benigna killed them.
That's why she went to the shed,

01:12:36.287 --> 01:12:38.084
to recover their bodies.

01:12:38.247 --> 01:12:39.236
I've thought it out.

01:12:39.727 --> 01:12:41.957
Their game killed Tomas

01:12:42.127 --> 01:12:45.244
and now they're playing
with Simon and me.

01:12:47.167 --> 01:12:50.159
Simon's in danger
and I don't know how to play.

01:12:50.847 --> 01:12:51.882
I don't know how to play.

01:12:52.047 --> 01:12:53.639
Laura, you're making it up.

01:12:53.807 --> 01:12:55.638
I saw it myself.

01:12:55.807 --> 01:12:58.560
And this afternoon?
Who laid out the clues?

01:12:58.727 --> 01:13:00.604
Simon made it all up.

01:13:00.767 --> 01:13:02.166
Who?

01:13:02.327 --> 01:13:03.646
Tell me! Who?

01:13:05.727 --> 01:13:08.082
I've packed.
I don't want us to stay here.

01:13:10.087 --> 01:13:11.122
I can't leave yet.

01:13:11.287 --> 01:13:13.437
I won't live here,

01:13:14.407 --> 01:13:15.886
and you're not staying alone.

01:13:17.047 --> 01:13:20.005
I can't just leave,
there are too many memories.

01:13:20.767 --> 01:13:22.485
I have to say goodbye.

01:13:28.127 --> 01:13:29.401
Two days.

01:13:29.847 --> 01:13:30.802
Alone.

01:13:32.807 --> 01:13:34.525
Please, I need this.

01:13:36.807 --> 01:13:38.081
Please.

01:17:42.447 --> 01:17:44.199
Please bless
what you have given us.

01:17:48.767 --> 01:17:52.760
Thank you for letting us
gather once again

01:17:54.047 --> 01:17:56.003
and be together.

01:18:22.367 --> 01:18:24.597
What else do you want?

01:18:25.527 --> 01:18:27.518
What more must I do?
What?

01:18:28.927 --> 01:18:30.918
I have no time,
I have no time.

01:18:43.527 --> 01:18:46.360
You want to keep playing?
Is that it?

01:18:46.687 --> 01:18:48.882
Let's make a deal.
I'll play a while,

01:18:49.047 --> 01:18:51.402
then you tell me where Simon is.

01:18:53.727 --> 01:18:55.046
OK?

01:19:22.687 --> 01:19:25.485
One, two, three,
knock on the wall!

01:19:35.127 --> 01:19:37.766
One, two, three,
knock on the wall.

01:21:06.567 --> 01:21:08.364
Wait, wait!
No.

01:21:08.527 --> 01:21:11.246
I won't hurt you.
I just want to find Simon...

01:25:21.407 --> 01:25:22.760
Why are you crying?

01:25:24.367 --> 01:25:25.561
Oh, my darling!

01:25:28.327 --> 01:25:30.966
Are you OK?
You're freezing.

01:25:32.287 --> 01:25:34.005
Don't worry about a thing.

01:25:34.287 --> 01:25:36.323
Don't be afraid,
I'll get you out.

01:25:45.407 --> 01:25:47.125
Stay and play with us.

01:25:48.247 --> 01:25:49.521
We can't stay to play.

01:25:55.927 --> 01:25:57.804
Listen to me, Simon.

01:25:58.127 --> 01:26:01.563
Imagine it's just you
and me here. OK?

01:26:02.567 --> 01:26:05.286
Think about before we came
to this house.

01:26:05.567 --> 01:26:06.886
Remember?

01:26:07.087 --> 01:26:09.157
Think only about that, OK?

01:26:09.327 --> 01:26:11.477
Think only about that,

01:26:11.927 --> 01:26:13.042
think about Daddy,

01:26:13.207 --> 01:26:15.038
think about next Christmas,

01:26:15.207 --> 01:26:17.801
and all the things we'll do together.

01:26:18.247 --> 01:26:19.646
So many things, darling!

01:26:19.807 --> 01:26:22.116
Close your eyes, tight,

01:26:22.287 --> 01:26:24.596
shut them really tight

01:26:25.967 --> 01:26:29.323
and think about what you'll be
when you grow up.

01:26:29.727 --> 01:26:32.002
What would you like to be, darling?

01:26:32.167 --> 01:26:35.637
Think about the schools you'll go to,
the friends you'll make.

01:26:38.007 --> 01:26:39.884
And just believe for a moment

01:26:42.087 --> 01:26:45.363
that Tomas and the other children
aren't real.

01:26:46.567 --> 01:26:48.523
This is a fantasy, my darling,

01:26:48.727 --> 01:26:50.285
like a nightmare.

01:26:54.367 --> 01:26:56.198
Do it for me, Simon.

01:26:57.127 --> 01:26:58.845
When you open your eyes,

01:27:00.087 --> 01:27:01.361
make them go away.

01:27:25.887 --> 01:27:27.479
Close your eyes, darling,

01:27:27.887 --> 01:27:29.684
and keep on playing with me.

01:27:32.607 --> 01:27:35.326
Keep on playing, darling, OK?

01:28:17.847 --> 01:28:20.042
<i>-What is it?</i>
<i>-Tomas' little house.</i>

01:30:18.167 --> 01:30:20.203
I found you.
This isn't fair.

01:30:24.767 --> 01:30:26.519
I found you...

01:32:06.687 --> 01:32:08.564
I want Simon back!

01:33:07.807 --> 01:33:09.445
Mummy, can I wake up?

01:33:13.247 --> 01:33:15.636
Of course you can, darling.

01:33:20.167 --> 01:33:20.917
Mummy...

01:33:23.047 --> 01:33:24.878
I found the special coins.

01:33:25.047 --> 01:33:27.481
Now I just have to make a wish.

01:33:28.367 --> 01:33:31.564
I wish you'll stay
and look after all of us.

01:34:25.647 --> 01:34:26.397
It's Laura!

01:34:40.567 --> 01:34:43.286
She's grown old,
like Wendy in the story.

01:34:47.487 --> 01:34:48.806
It's Laura.

01:34:55.487 --> 01:34:56.966
Come, don't be afraid.

01:34:59.327 --> 01:35:03.320
The house. The beach.
The lost children.

01:35:08.887 --> 01:35:10.445
Once upon a time

01:35:10.607 --> 01:35:12.916
there was a house near the beach

01:35:13.207 --> 01:35:15.846
where the lost children lived...

01:35:53.727 --> 01:35:55.763
In memory of Laura and Simon

01:35:55.927 --> 01:35:57.565
and of the orphans

01:35:57.727 --> 01:36:00.799
Martin, Rita,
Guillermo, Alicia, Victor

01:36:00.967 --> 01:36:02.320
and Tomas

01:41:09.407 --> 01:41:11.762
