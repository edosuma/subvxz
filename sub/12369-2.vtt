WEBVTT

00:02.127 --> 00:03.670
-<i> HOT IN CLEVELAND</i>
IS RECORDED IN FRONT

00:03.753 --> 00:05.380
OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:05.463 --> 00:07.090
- ISN'T WILBUR BEAUTIFUL?

00:07.173 --> 00:08.758
- YES.

00:08.842 --> 00:12.595
HE DOESN'T LOOK
A THING LIKE YOU.

00:12.679 --> 00:14.222
- HE'S GOT MY EARS.

00:14.305 --> 00:17.183
- DON'T WORRY.
HE CAN GET THOSE PINNED BACK.

00:20.353 --> 00:21.813
- GOOD MORNING.

00:21.896 --> 00:24.566
- WOW, THAT'S SOME OUTFIT.

00:24.649 --> 00:28.278
- IS IT
"TAKE THE GIRLS TO WORK" DAY?

00:28.361 --> 00:29.612
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.614
THIS IS PERFECTLY APPROPRIATE
OFFICE ATTIRE.

00:31.698 --> 00:34.451
- IF YOU'RE SECRETLY IN LOVE
WITH YOUR BOSS.

00:34.534 --> 00:36.411
I THOUGHT YOUR PLAN WAS TO FIGHT
YOUR ATTRACTION TO ALEC.

00:36.494 --> 00:37.829
- IT IS.

00:37.912 --> 00:38.955
AND I WASN'T EVEN THINKING
ABOUT ALEC

00:39.038 --> 00:43.126
WHEN I PUT ON
MY DO-ME BRA

00:43.209 --> 00:46.087
AND MY DO-ME DRESS
AND MY DO-ME SHOES.

00:49.174 --> 00:51.468
OH, WILBUR,
DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT.

00:51.551 --> 00:52.635
[baby coos]

00:52.719 --> 00:54.304
OKAY, I'M LYING.

00:54.387 --> 00:56.306
WHAT IS IT
ABOUT THAT SWEET SMILE

00:56.389 --> 00:58.141
THAT JUST CUTS
RIGHT THROUGH THE B.S.?

00:58.224 --> 00:59.976
- AND MAKES YOU WANT TO BE
A BETTER PERSON.

01:00.059 --> 01:01.811
- I DIDN'T EVEN
PUT WHISKEY

01:01.895 --> 01:04.772
ON MY OATMEAL
THIS MORNING.

01:04.855 --> 01:06.149
ALL RIGHT,
WILBUR.

01:06.232 --> 01:09.319
I PUT
LESS WHISKEY.

01:09.402 --> 01:11.780
- WILBUR, I PROMISE
TO GET THROUGH THIS DAY

01:11.863 --> 01:13.114
WITHOUT FLIRTING
WITH MY BOSS.

01:13.198 --> 01:15.200
ALTHOUGH
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU

01:15.283 --> 01:17.118
HE'S BEEN A LITTLE FLIRTY
WITH ME?

01:17.202 --> 01:18.828
OKAY, YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

01:18.912 --> 01:22.999
FOR ONCE, I'M GONNA FORGET
THE GUY AND FOCUS ON MY CAREER.

01:23.082 --> 01:25.710
- MAYBE IT'S
THE OATMEAL TALKING,

01:25.794 --> 01:29.172
BUT THAT KID
MAKES SENSE.

01:29.255 --> 01:31.299
- WELL, I REALLY AM FOCUSING
ON MY WORK.

01:31.382 --> 01:33.676
I'M A LITTLE LOOPY
'CAUSE I WAS UP UNTIL 2:00 A.M.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.011
TRYING TO COME UP
WITH P.R. SLOGANS

01:35.094 --> 01:36.930
TO ATTRACT PEOPLE
TO CLEVELAND.

01:37.013 --> 01:39.182
- I'LL TELL YOU, THERE IS
NO PLACE LIKE CLEVELAND

01:39.265 --> 01:41.017
IF YOU WANT
TO GET FAT.

01:41.100 --> 01:44.395
- THERE'S A WINNER.

01:44.479 --> 01:45.855
- YOU WANT
TO GAIN WEIGHT?

01:45.939 --> 01:48.149
- OH,
THESE AREN'T GROCERIES.

01:48.233 --> 01:50.318
THESE ARE OSCAR BAIT.

01:50.401 --> 01:52.862
LIKE CHARLIZE THERON
AND RENEE ZELLWEGER,

01:52.946 --> 01:56.366
I HAVE BEEN ASKED BY MY DIRECTOR
TO GAIN WEIGHT FOR A MOVIE.

01:56.449 --> 01:59.577
WOODY ALLEN REQUESTS IT,
THE ACADEMY RESPECTS IT,

01:59.661 --> 02:02.205
AND THE OSCAR DISPLAY CASE
THAT I BUILT 20 YEARS AGO

02:02.288 --> 02:06.209
COULD REALLY USE IT.

02:06.292 --> 02:10.797
- THAT'S MY DREAM, TO HAVE
SOMEONE DEMAND I GAIN WEIGHT.

02:10.880 --> 02:15.385
PREFERABLY GEORGE CLOONEY
IN A TUXEDO

02:15.468 --> 02:17.053
IN HIS VILLA
IN LAKE COMO,

02:17.137 --> 02:21.391
HOLDING A PLATTER
OF CANNOLI,

02:21.474 --> 02:23.226
SAYING,
<i>"MANGIA, MANGIA."</i>

02:23.309 --> 02:27.647
- HE'S PROBABLY JUST TRYING
TO GET YOU TO STOP TALKING.

02:37.907 --> 02:40.076
{\an8}- GRANDMA?

02:40.159 --> 02:42.537
{\an8}NAH,
TOO OLD-FASHIONED.

02:42.620 --> 02:44.414
{\an8}GRANNY?

02:44.497 --> 02:47.709
{\an8}WHAT AM I,
A CLAMPETT?

02:47.792 --> 02:50.503
{\an8}NANA?
YEAH.

02:50.587 --> 02:55.675
{\an8}STRONG, SEXY,
WITH JUST A HINT OF DANGER.

02:55.758 --> 02:59.053
{\an8}NANA IS GONNA BE WITH YOU
EVERY STEP OF THE WAY,

02:59.137 --> 03:02.056
{\an8}FROM PRESCHOOL
TO COLLEGE.

03:02.140 --> 03:05.977
{\an8}AND YOU WILL GO TO COLLEGE,
WILBUR.

03:06.060 --> 03:08.313
{\an8}OH, I KNOW,
I NEVER GRADUATED.

03:08.396 --> 03:10.398
{\an8}AND...
[chuckles]

03:10.481 --> 03:12.400
{\an8}YOU'RE RIGHT,
I HAVE TIME NOW.

03:12.483 --> 03:15.320
{\an8}AND, YES, I REALIZE
CLEVELAND STATE

03:15.403 --> 03:16.946
{\an8}IS ONLY
A COUPLE OF MILES AWAY.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.532
{\an8}HOW DO YOU KNOW
THESE THINGS?

03:21.284 --> 03:22.160
{\an8}WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO?

03:22.243 --> 03:24.454
{\an8}- JUST OUT.

03:24.537 --> 03:26.456
{\an8}- WHY ARE YOU BEING
SO EVASIVE?

03:26.539 --> 03:27.832
{\an8}YOU'VE BEEN GOING "JUST OUT"
A LOT LATELY.

03:27.916 --> 03:30.293
{\an8}WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

03:30.376 --> 03:32.921
{\an8}- IF I TOLD YOU,
I'D HAVE TO KILL YOU.

03:35.548 --> 03:37.300
{\an8}I'M TORN.

03:39.886 --> 03:42.972
{\an8}- GOOD MORNING, ALEC.
- MELANIE, GOOD MORNING.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.766
{\an8}YOU ARE LOOKING
LOVELY TODAY.

03:44.849 --> 03:48.394
{\an8}- OH,
I WASN'T TRYING TO.

03:48.478 --> 03:49.646
{\an8}- YOU HAVE AN INTERESTING WAY
OF TAKING A COMPLIMENT.

03:49.729 --> 03:51.564
{\an8}- THANK YOU.

03:51.648 --> 03:53.942
- THAT ONE WASN'T REALLY
A COMPLIMENT.

03:54.025 --> 03:56.361
- OH, SORRY.
[chuckles]

03:56.444 --> 03:57.946
- BOY, YOU SURE ARE CUTE
WHEN YOU BLUSH.

03:58.029 --> 04:01.449
- I DIDN'T MEAN TO BE.

04:01.532 --> 04:02.617
- BISCOTTI?

04:02.700 --> 04:04.035
- OH, NO, I SHOULDN'T.

04:04.118 --> 04:06.496
- OH, COME ON.
<i>MANGIA, MANGIA.</i>

04:12.335 --> 04:14.003
- OKAY.

04:14.087 --> 04:18.966
[thunder]

04:19.050 --> 04:21.678
WOW.

04:21.761 --> 04:24.055
- YEAH, CHLOE IS NOT
GONNA BE HAPPY ABOUT THIS.

04:24.138 --> 04:26.516
- WE WERE JUST SHARING
A BISCOTTI.

04:26.599 --> 04:29.352
- NO, CHLOE IS AFRAID
OF THUNDER AND HEIGHTS,

04:29.435 --> 04:30.853
THE COLOR ORANGE,
BUT THE WORD "BLUE."

04:30.937 --> 04:32.021
DO NOT MIX THAT UP.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.691
- WOW.

04:34.774 --> 04:36.401
- WELL, LISTEN, ALL BEAUTIFUL
WOMEN ARE CRAZY, RIGHT?

04:36.484 --> 04:38.778
- WELL, CHLOE IS
VERY BEAUTIFUL, YES.

04:38.861 --> 04:42.156
- THAT TIME,
I WAS TALKING ABOUT YOU.

04:42.240 --> 04:44.534
- OH, THANK YOU.
OR HOW DARE YOU!

04:44.617 --> 04:47.996
I'M SO CONFUSED.
[laughs]

04:48.079 --> 04:50.707
- LET'S GET TO WORK,
SHALL WE?

04:50.790 --> 04:52.834
THE OHIO WINE COUNCIL
WANTS A VENUE

04:52.917 --> 04:54.877
FOR THEIR NEW CHARDONNAY LAUNCH,
SOMEPLACE ROMANTIC.

04:54.961 --> 04:55.920
- YEAH.
AND I WAS THINKING FERULLO'S.

04:56.004 --> 04:57.714
- OOH, I'VE NEVER BEEN.

04:57.797 --> 04:59.924
TELL YOU WHAT, HOW ABOUT YOU
AND I CHECK IT OUT THURSDAY?

05:00.008 --> 05:03.011
SAY, DRINKS AT 7:00?

05:03.094 --> 05:04.178
- YEAH.
SOUNDS GREAT.

05:04.262 --> 05:06.889
- IT'S A DATE.
- A DATE.

05:06.973 --> 05:09.892
- MORNING.
- CHLOE, HI!

05:09.976 --> 05:10.935
- THAT THUNDER.
HOLD ME!

05:11.019 --> 05:12.395
- THE THUNDER IS OVER,
CHLOE.

05:12.478 --> 05:14.731
- COME ON, YOU KNOW YOU WANT ME.
I'M YOUR WIFE.

05:14.814 --> 05:16.232
- EX-WIFE.

05:16.315 --> 05:19.068
- I COULD BE
YOUR X-RATED WIFE.

05:19.152 --> 05:21.487
- THAT'S A NICE THOUGHT, BUT WE
BOTH KNOW THAT OUR MARRIAGE

05:21.571 --> 05:23.281
ENDED WITH AN R-RATING
FOR STRONG LANGUAGE

05:23.364 --> 05:26.451
AND UNPLEASANT
ADULT SITUATIONS.

05:26.534 --> 05:30.538
I'M GONNA GO GRAB SOME COFFEE.
LADIES.

05:30.621 --> 05:32.790
- HE IS SO HANDSOME.
WHY DID I EVER DIVORCE HIM?

05:32.874 --> 05:34.417
- YEAH, WHY DID YOU?

05:34.500 --> 05:37.211
- I WAS YOUNG AND FOOLISH
AND WANTED TO LAND A BIG ACCOUNT

05:37.295 --> 05:39.464
AND DIDN'T THINK
HE'D BE HOME SO EARLY.

05:41.841 --> 05:43.426
- YOU HAD AN AFFAIR
TO GET AN ACCOUNT?

05:43.509 --> 05:45.428
- IT WAS
A TOP-THREE TIRE COMPANY.

05:45.511 --> 05:48.222
DON'T MAKE IT
SOUND CHEAP.

05:48.306 --> 05:50.224
MELANIE,
I'M WORRIED.

05:50.308 --> 05:52.101
WHEN I FLIRT WITH ALEC,
HE ALWAYS FLIRTS BACK,

05:52.185 --> 05:53.394
BUT LATELY,
NOTHING.

05:53.478 --> 05:55.563
AND OBVIOUSLY,
I CAN STILL BRING IT,

05:55.646 --> 05:58.107
SO I'M PRETTY SURE
HE'S FALLING FOR SOMEONE ELSE.

05:58.191 --> 06:01.277
- YOU REALLY THINK SO?

06:01.360 --> 06:02.779
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
WHY WOULD I CARE?

06:02.862 --> 06:04.238
- WELL, YOU CARE
BECAUSE I'M YOUR BOSS,

06:04.322 --> 06:05.615
AND I'M ORDERING YOU
TO FIND OUT

06:05.698 --> 06:08.576
WHO THIS EX-HUSBAND-STEALING
BITCH IS.

06:08.659 --> 06:12.497
I NEED YOU TO BE
ON TOP OF ALEC EVERY MINUTE.

06:12.580 --> 06:13.956
- GLADLY.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.416
I MEAN,
UM, I'LL--

06:15.500 --> 06:18.836
I'LL DO HIM--
I'LL DO IT!

06:18.920 --> 06:21.506
SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
TO HER WHEN YOU FIND HER?

06:21.589 --> 06:23.633
- [clicks tongue]
GREAT THING ABOUT OHIO,

06:23.716 --> 06:26.636
EVERYBODY'S GOT
A WOOD CHIPPER.

06:26.719 --> 06:28.346
[thunder]
I'M SCARED.

06:28.429 --> 06:31.390
- ME TOO.

06:34.018 --> 06:35.144
- SO BASICALLY...
- HMM?

06:35.228 --> 06:37.480
- CHLOE'S ASKING ME
TO SPY ON MYSELF.

06:37.563 --> 06:39.982
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?
- NO IDEA.

06:40.066 --> 06:41.776
- YOU'RE SURE YOU'RE THE ONE
HE'S INTERESTED IN?

06:41.859 --> 06:43.361
- I AM.

06:43.444 --> 06:44.487
HE LOOKED AT ME
THE WAY I'M LOOKING

06:44.570 --> 06:47.490
AT THIS THIRD CUPCAKE.

06:47.573 --> 06:49.200
- FOR ME,
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE FRENCH FRIES.

06:49.283 --> 06:53.871
OH, COME TO MOMMY, YOU SALTY,
GREASY BIT OF HEAVEN.

06:53.955 --> 06:55.665
I'M GONNA PUT YOU
IN MY MOUTH.

06:55.748 --> 06:58.000
- I BET YOU WISH
YOU HAD A DIME

06:58.084 --> 07:00.211
FOR EVERY TIME
YOU'VE SAID THAT.

07:03.589 --> 07:05.800
- ALL RIGHT, YOU TWO.
THAT'S ENOUGH, NO FIGHTING.

07:05.883 --> 07:07.802
NOW I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL
FOR SUPPORTING ME

07:07.885 --> 07:11.180
BY GAINING
A SOLIDARITY POUND.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.683
OH, IT'S SO LIBERATING
TO BE ABLE TO JUST PIG OUT.

07:13.766 --> 07:16.811
YUM!

07:23.276 --> 07:25.069
- VICTORIA, ALL YOU ATE
WAS A SPRINKLE.

07:25.153 --> 07:28.823
- [mouth full]
DELICIOUS.

07:28.906 --> 07:31.409
- IT'S STILL IN YOUR MOUTH,
ISN'T IT?

07:31.492 --> 07:33.035
- NOT ANYMORE.

07:33.119 --> 07:36.622
WELL, THAT JUST WENT
STRAIGHT TO MY THIGHS.

07:36.706 --> 07:38.833
- I THOUGHT YOU WANTED
TO GAIN WEIGHT FOR THIS PART.

07:38.916 --> 07:40.918
- WELL, I DO,
BUT IT'S JUST SUCH HARD WORK.

07:41.002 --> 07:44.547
- IT'S NOT HARD!
IT'S A CUPCAKE.

07:44.630 --> 07:48.176
IT'S LITERALLY
A PIECE OF CAKE.

07:48.259 --> 07:49.427
I MEAN, I COULD EAT THEM
IN MY SLEEP.

07:49.510 --> 07:51.179
I DO EAT THEM
IN MY SLEEP.

07:51.262 --> 07:52.889
AND THEN I WAKE UP HORRIFIED
FROM THE DREAM,

07:52.972 --> 07:54.849
AND THEN I'M MAD AT MYSELF
FOR NOT ENJOYING IT

07:54.932 --> 07:57.018
BECAUSE IT WAS JUST A DREAM,
FOR GOD'S SAKES!

07:59.020 --> 08:02.899
BUT GO ON,
YOU SAID YOU HAD FOOD ISSUES.

08:02.982 --> 08:05.735
- WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
JUST EAT.

08:11.115 --> 08:15.369
- I CAN'T DO THIS.

08:15.453 --> 08:16.370
- POOR VICTORIA.

08:16.454 --> 08:17.872
SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN THIN.

08:17.955 --> 08:19.415
THIS IS TOTALLY
OUT OF HER COMFORT ZONE.

08:19.498 --> 08:21.083
- YEAH.

08:21.167 --> 08:23.085
MAYBE IT'S GOOD
TO GET OUT OF YOUR COMFORT ZONE.

08:23.169 --> 08:23.961
I MEAN,
I'M ALWAYS WORRIED

08:24.045 --> 08:27.215
ABOUT CONSEQUENCES
AND PLANNING AHEAD.

08:27.298 --> 08:28.507
YOU KNOW WHAT?

08:28.591 --> 08:31.052
I'M JUST GONNA LET
THINGS HAPPEN WITH ALEC.

08:31.135 --> 08:32.428
LET THE CHIPS FALL
WHERE THEY MAY.

08:32.510 --> 08:35.264
OH!
CHIPS.

08:35.347 --> 08:38.976
- WELL, IF WE'RE ALL BREAKING
FREE OF OUR COMFORT ZONES,

08:39.059 --> 08:41.479
I'M THINKING
ABOUT GOING BACK TO COLLEGE.

08:41.562 --> 08:43.438
IT'S ALWAYS BOTHERED ME
THAT I DIDN'T FINISH,

08:43.522 --> 08:46.275
AND I WANT TO SET
A GOOD EXAMPLE FOR WILBUR.

08:46.359 --> 08:47.944
- THAT'S FANTASTIC!

08:48.027 --> 08:52.073
- IS NOBODY GONNA SAY
THE OBVIOUS?

08:52.156 --> 08:54.533
SHE'S TOO OLD.

08:58.162 --> 09:01.999
- ALL RIGHT.
THIS SHOULD EXPLAIN EVERYTHING.

09:02.083 --> 09:06.671
I WORE THESE TO CAMP
NEW BEGINNINGS WHEN I WAS 10.

09:06.754 --> 09:08.256
- YOU WENT TO FAT CAMP?

09:08.339 --> 09:12.510
- NO, IT WAS A SPORTS CAMP
FOR FAT KIDS.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.097
- YOU NEVER TOLD US.

09:16.180 --> 09:18.766
- YEAH, WELL, I BLOCKED
A LOT OF THAT TIME OUT.

09:18.849 --> 09:20.142
BUT I STILL REMEMBER

09:20.226 --> 09:22.270
WHAT THE OTHER KIDS
AT SCHOOL CALLED ME.

09:22.353 --> 09:23.813
"THICKTORIA CHASE"

09:23.896 --> 09:27.483
OR "VICTORIA CHASES
AN ICE CREAM TRUCK."

09:27.567 --> 09:29.277
ALSO, "LARDASS."

09:29.360 --> 09:32.863
- [laughs]

09:36.033 --> 09:38.869
- BUT WITH HARD WORK,
BY THE END OF THAT SUMMER,

09:38.953 --> 09:41.956
I WENT FROM "THICKTORIA"
TO "STICKTORIA."

09:42.039 --> 09:42.873
AND I KEEP
THESE PANTS AROUND

09:42.957 --> 09:45.960
JUST TO REMIND ME
NEVER TO GET FAT AGAIN.

09:46.043 --> 09:48.212
AND NOW I HAVE
THE ROLE OF A LIFETIME,

09:48.296 --> 09:52.466
AND I CAN'T EAT THE ROLLS
TO MAKE IT HAPPEN.

09:52.550 --> 09:55.469
- WHY DON'T YOU JUST CHEW
THE SCENERY LIKE YOU USUALLY DO?

09:57.596 --> 09:59.890
- WHY CANT YOU JUST TALK
TO WOODY, EXPLAIN THE SITUATION?

09:59.974 --> 10:02.143
- YEAH, MAYBE HE'LL SAY
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

10:02.226 --> 10:05.021
- WELL, I GUESS IT COULDN'T HURT
TO ASK, RIGHT?

10:05.104 --> 10:06.522
[thunder]

10:06.605 --> 10:09.400
[phone ringing]

10:09.483 --> 10:11.360
- OH, BOY.

10:11.444 --> 10:12.903
HI, CHLOE.

10:12.987 --> 10:16.532
SHE'S AFRAID
OF THUNDER.

10:16.615 --> 10:19.410
- OH, NO, OH, NO,
OH, NO!

10:23.789 --> 10:26.167
HOLD ME.
- OH, OKAY.

10:26.250 --> 10:28.711
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY, CHLOE.

10:28.794 --> 10:30.087
- I MISS ALEC.

10:30.171 --> 10:31.922
HE WAS
SUCH A GOOD THUNDER BUDDY.

10:32.006 --> 10:34.216
AT THE FIRST CRACK OF LIGHTING,
HE'D SWOOP ME UP,

10:34.300 --> 10:38.179
CARRY ME TO BED,
AND HOLD ME ALL NIGHT.

10:38.262 --> 10:41.724
[both sigh]

10:41.807 --> 10:44.602
- HE SEEMS LIKE
HE'D BE REALLY GREAT AT...

10:44.685 --> 10:46.604
THUNDER BUDDY-ING.

10:46.687 --> 10:49.857
- ALEC WAS
THE PERFECT HUSBAND,

10:49.940 --> 10:52.860
AND I RUINED IT.

10:52.943 --> 10:54.945
ANY INFORMATION ON THAT SLUT
HE'S INTERESTED IN?

10:55.029 --> 10:56.697
- NO, NO.

10:56.781 --> 10:59.367
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHO THE SLUT COULD BE?

10:59.450 --> 11:00.659
- [sighs]
I OVERHEARD HIM

11:00.743 --> 11:01.911
ON THE PHONE
TALKING TO HIS BROTHER

11:01.994 --> 11:05.414
ABOUT A CURVY BRUNETTE
WITH A KILLER SMILE.

11:05.498 --> 11:08.250
- KILLER SMILE, HUH?

11:08.334 --> 11:10.920
MM, DID HE SAY
ANYTHING ELSE?

11:11.003 --> 11:12.588
- NO.

11:12.671 --> 11:14.590
I FEEL LIKE I CAN TRUST YOU,
MELANIE.

11:14.673 --> 11:16.926
- [inhales deeply]

11:17.009 --> 11:19.136
YEAH, YOU CAN.

11:22.223 --> 11:23.682
LISTEN, I WILL FIND
THIS HOT BRUNETTE.

11:23.766 --> 11:25.726
- I DIDN'T SAY HOT.

11:25.810 --> 11:26.936
- WELL, YEAH,
BUT SHE SOUNDS

11:27.019 --> 11:29.480
LIKE SHE'S GOT
A LOT GOING FOR HER.

11:29.563 --> 11:32.608
I WILL FIND HER
AND TELL HER TO FORGET

11:32.692 --> 11:34.276
ABOUT ALEC.

11:34.360 --> 11:37.738
IT'S A LOST CAUSE.

11:37.822 --> 11:40.449
- YOU'RE A BAD THUNDER-BUDDY
BUT YOU'RE A GOOD SPY,

11:40.533 --> 11:41.617
AND THAT'S MORE IMPORTANT
IN A FRIEND.

11:41.700 --> 11:44.245
- [sighs]

11:44.328 --> 11:46.038
HEY, THE RAIN STOPPED.

11:46.122 --> 11:47.248
- OH, THANK GOD.

11:47.331 --> 11:48.874
YOU CAN GO NOW.

11:48.958 --> 11:51.252
- WELL, IT'S 2:00
IN THE MORNING.

11:51.335 --> 11:53.337
- WE'RE DONE HERE.
SCOOT!

11:59.927 --> 12:02.596
- MELANIE, I LEFT THREE MESSAGES
WITH WOODY'S ASSISTANT,

12:02.680 --> 12:04.432
AND HE NEVER
CALLED ME BACK.

12:04.515 --> 12:06.809
[thunder]

12:06.892 --> 12:09.937
OH, THE LIGHTS IN MY TRAILER
JUST WENT OUT.

12:10.020 --> 12:11.605
[knock at door]

12:11.689 --> 12:14.150
- HELLO, MISS CHASE?
ARE YOU IN THERE?

12:14.233 --> 12:16.652
- OH, MY GOD!
IT'S WOODY!

12:16.735 --> 12:21.282
I GOTTA GO.
UH, COME IN.

12:21.365 --> 12:22.450
- WITH ALL THE THUNDER,

12:22.533 --> 12:24.493
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE
YOU WERE SAFE.

12:24.577 --> 12:27.830
- OH, WELL,
THAT'S SO SWEET.

12:27.913 --> 12:29.999
WELL, CAN YOU BELIEVE
THIS CLEVELAND WEATHER?

12:30.082 --> 12:33.169
LA-DI-DAH!
LA-DI-DAH.

12:33.252 --> 12:36.005
- IN THE LATE '60s, I TRIED
TO BECOME A WEATHERMAN.

12:36.088 --> 12:38.132
THIS WAS SHORTLY
AFTER THE BLACK PANTHERS

12:38.215 --> 12:40.134
TURNED DOWN
MY APPLICATION.

12:40.217 --> 12:41.844
APPARENTLY, I HAD
THE FIERCE HEART OF A RADICAL

12:41.927 --> 12:45.973
BUT THREW A MOLOTOV COCKTAIL
LIKE A GIRL.

12:46.056 --> 12:49.310
- LOOK, I AM SO GRATEFUL
TO BE A PART OF THIS FILM,

12:49.393 --> 12:50.811
BUT, UM, I'M JUST
REALLY STRUGGLING

12:50.895 --> 12:53.355
WITH THE CONCEPT
OF GAINING WEIGHT FOR THE ROLE.

12:53.439 --> 12:55.357
- IT WOULD BE A SHAME
TO DESECRATE

12:55.441 --> 12:57.359
SUCH A BEAUTIFUL FIGURE.

12:57.443 --> 13:00.863
{\an1}- ON THE OTHER HAND, I WANT TO
DO ANYTHING I CAN TO PLEASE YOU.

13:00.946 --> 13:03.532
- WELL,
THAT SOUNDS PROMISING.

13:05.826 --> 13:07.536
- YOU SLEPT
WITH WOODY ALLEN?

13:07.620 --> 13:10.706
- YES, AND I FEEL TERRIBLE
ABOUT IT.

13:10.789 --> 13:13.375
I-I DON'T KNOW
WHAT CAME OVER ME.

13:13.459 --> 13:16.837
- I CAN'T SAY I APPROVE, BUT DID
HE AT LEAST CHANGE THE PART,

13:16.921 --> 13:18.047
SO YOU DON'T HAVE
TO GAIN WEIGHT?

13:18.130 --> 13:21.217
- WELL, HE SAID
HE'D SEE WHAT HE COULD DO.

13:21.300 --> 13:22.676
I JUST HAVE TO MAKE IT
VERY CLEAR TO HIM

13:22.760 --> 13:24.887
THAT I CANNOT SLEEP
WITH HIM AGAIN.

13:24.970 --> 13:26.514
OH, IT'S JUST SUCH A CLICHE
TO HAVE AN AFFAIR

13:26.597 --> 13:28.390
WITH YOUR DIRECTOR.

13:28.474 --> 13:31.227
- OR YOUR BOSS.

13:35.314 --> 13:37.399
- THERE IS NOTHING
GOING ON HERE.

13:37.483 --> 13:40.236
CHLOE GUILTED ME RIGHT BACK
TO MY COMFORT ZONE.

13:40.319 --> 13:42.071
I MEAN, I'M STILL GONNA SEE
ALEC TOMORROW NIGHT,

13:42.154 --> 13:43.864
BUT IF ANYTHING
ROMANTIC HAPPENS,

13:43.948 --> 13:46.575
I'M JUST GONNA TELL HIM
I CAN'T.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.077
NOT RIGHT AWAY,
OF COURSE,

13:48.160 --> 13:50.162
'CAUSE I'M STILL ALLOWED
A LITTLE FLIRTING, RIGHT?

13:52.998 --> 13:54.875
- HEY, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
[door closing]

13:54.959 --> 13:57.253
- OUT.
HUMILIATING MYSELF.

13:57.336 --> 14:00.047
- SO JUST OUT.

14:02.049 --> 14:03.759
- WHAT HAPPENED?

14:03.842 --> 14:05.803
- WILBUR TALKED ME
INTO REGISTERING FOR COLLEGE,

14:05.886 --> 14:07.096
AND NOW I'M QUESTIONING
THE WHOLE THING.

14:07.179 --> 14:09.098
- OH, HONEY, WHY?

14:09.181 --> 14:11.225
- EVERYONE LOOKED AT ME
LIKE I WAS SOMEONE'S MOM

14:11.308 --> 14:14.770
OR A TEACHER
OR A TEACHER'S MOM.

14:14.853 --> 14:15.896
I OVERHEARD
ONE GIRL SAY,

14:15.980 --> 14:20.401
"IF I'M STILL IN SCHOOL
WHEN I'M THAT OLD, KILL ME."

14:20.484 --> 14:22.903
THEY OBVIOUSLY THINK I'M SOME
DESPERATE, MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN

14:22.987 --> 14:24.822
TRYING TO DO SOMETHING
WITH HER LIFE.

14:24.905 --> 14:28.450
- KIDS CAN BE
SO CRUEL.

14:28.534 --> 14:31.745
AND SO RIGHT.

14:33.872 --> 14:36.458
- I'M SORRY, WILBUR.
I'M NOT GOING BACK.

14:36.542 --> 14:40.129
[baby fusses]

14:40.212 --> 14:43.632
OH, NO.
DID I JUST MAKE HIM FROWN?

14:43.716 --> 14:45.968
I CAN'T BE RESPONSIBLE
FOR HIS FIRST WRINKLE.

14:46.051 --> 14:49.305
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL DO IT.

14:49.388 --> 14:52.141
[baby giggles]

14:52.224 --> 14:54.852
- YOU KNOW, THIS CUYAHOGA RIVER
CHARDONNAY, DESPITE ITS NAME,

14:54.935 --> 14:57.146
IS ACTUALLY--IT'S PRETTY GOOD.
- MMM.

14:57.229 --> 15:00.316
- I'M GETTING NOTES OF CITRUS
AND ANJOU PEAR AND HONEYSUCKLE.

15:00.399 --> 15:03.444
- THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.
HOW DO YOU DO THAT?

15:03.527 --> 15:07.281
- I READ THE LABEL.
- [laughs]

15:07.364 --> 15:08.490
- IT'S A LITTLE TRICK
I LEARNED TO IMPRESS WOMEN.

15:08.574 --> 15:10.784
ALSO,
IT MAY CONTAIN SULFITES.

15:10.868 --> 15:13.954
- VERY SEXY.
- [laughs]

15:14.038 --> 15:15.414
MAN, YOU'VE GOT
A KILLER SMILE.

15:15.497 --> 15:17.499
- SO I'VE HEARD.

15:17.583 --> 15:20.878
I MEAN--
[clears throat] THANK YOU.

15:20.961 --> 15:22.421
- THIS PLACE REALLY
IS ROMANTIC.

15:22.504 --> 15:25.883
- MM-HMM.

15:25.966 --> 15:29.136
- SO THE CLIENT SAID
THEY WANTED THE KIND OF PLACE

15:29.219 --> 15:31.180
WHERE YOU TAKE SOMEONE
WHEN YOU WANT THEM

15:31.263 --> 15:34.516
TO FALL IN LOVE
WITH YOU, RIGHT?

15:34.600 --> 15:38.395
I COULD CERTAINLY SEE FALLING
IN LOVE HERE, COULDN'T YOU?

15:38.479 --> 15:40.856
- YEAH,
I COULD SEE THAT.

15:40.939 --> 15:42.900
ALEC, UM--
[clears throat]

15:42.983 --> 15:44.693
I'M SORRY, ALEC.
THIS ISN'T GONNA WORK.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.070
- WHY NOT?

15:46.153 --> 15:49.239
- WELL, WE HAVE
SOME PRETTY BIG OBSTACLES HERE.

15:49.323 --> 15:52.076
- WELL, I SUPPOSE SO.

15:52.159 --> 15:56.705
I DON'T USUALLY GO
FOR SOMETHING SO OLD.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.248
- EXCUSE ME?

15:58.332 --> 16:00.834
- TH--THIS RESTAURANT,
IT'S GOT A LOT OF CHARM.

16:00.918 --> 16:03.087
- OH, THE RESTAURANT.

16:03.170 --> 16:05.089
YEAH, NO,
THE RESTAURANT'S PERFECT, UM--

16:05.172 --> 16:07.925
- OH, MY DATE IS HERE.
SHE'S EARLY.

16:08.008 --> 16:09.551
- YOUR DATE?

16:09.635 --> 16:13.097
- YEAH.
RIGHT OVER THERE.

16:13.180 --> 16:16.016
- CURVY BRUNETTE
WITH A KILLER SMILE...

16:16.100 --> 16:19.061
WHO'S SO YOUNG.

16:19.144 --> 16:20.604
YEAH, THAT'S GREAT.

16:20.688 --> 16:23.023
GOOD FOR YOU!
I'D HIT THAT. [laughs]

16:24.650 --> 16:26.610
- YOU'RE FUNNY.
- UH-HUH.

16:26.694 --> 16:28.278
- YEAH, I FIGURED I WAS GOING
TO BE HERE WITH YOU ON BUSINESS,

16:28.362 --> 16:29.863
WHY NOT MEET HER
FOR DINNER AFTER?

16:29.947 --> 16:32.366
- FOR PLEASURE.
MAKES PERFECT SENSE.

16:32.449 --> 16:35.577
- THIS WAS FUN.
- YEAH.

16:35.661 --> 16:39.206
- I'M ALMOST SORRY
SHE CAME EARLY.

16:39.289 --> 16:41.166
- NO, I THINK SHE CAME
AT JUST THE RIGHT TIME.

16:44.378 --> 16:46.463
- TOMORROW THEN.
- TOMORROW.

16:54.471 --> 16:58.058
NOTES OF HUMILIATION
AND DEFEAT.

16:58.142 --> 17:00.936
- SO THAT'S HER.
- [coughs]

17:01.019 --> 17:03.439
CHLOE,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

17:03.522 --> 17:05.941
- I OVERHEARD HIM MAKE
RESERVATIONS, SO I FOLLOWED HIM.

17:06.023 --> 17:07.233
YOU BEAT ME TO IT.
GOOD JOB.

17:07.317 --> 17:09.403
- OH, YEAH, RIGHT.
THAT, YEAH.

17:09.486 --> 17:11.280
AND YOU KNOW, AS SOON
AS HE SAW ME TAILING HIM,

17:11.363 --> 17:13.281
WELL, YOU KNOW,
I HAD TO JOIN HIM FOR A DRINK.

17:13.365 --> 17:15.159
- FOR A SECOND,
WHEN I SAW YOUR CAR IN THE LOT,

17:15.242 --> 17:16.617
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE HIS MYSTERY WOMAN.

17:16.702 --> 17:18.454
- YEAH, LIKE HE'D BE
INTERESTED IN ME.

17:18.537 --> 17:20.664
- RIGHT.
IT SEEMS SO OBVIOUS NOW.

17:22.374 --> 17:25.419
[sighs]
I HATE HER.

17:25.502 --> 17:27.963
- ME TOO.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.716
YOU KNOW,
ON YOUR BEHALF.

17:30.799 --> 17:32.092
SO NOW THAT WE KNOW
THE TRUTH,

17:32.176 --> 17:33.635
I GUESS MAYBE
WE CAN JUST MOVE ON.

17:33.719 --> 17:35.304
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

17:35.387 --> 17:37.723
HE'LL NEVER BE HAPPY
WITH THAT YOUNG PIECE OF FLUFF.

17:37.806 --> 17:39.975
- SO THERE'S HOPE?
- OH, THERE'S HOPE.

17:40.058 --> 17:41.977
I'LL GET HIM BACK.
TEAM CHLOE, RIGHT?

17:42.060 --> 17:44.688
- YEAH.
TEAM CHLOE!

17:44.772 --> 17:46.023
- YOU SAY IT WEIRD.

17:54.072 --> 17:56.909
- WELCOME TO ECON 101.
I'M PROFESSOR OLIVER.

17:56.992 --> 17:59.703
I SEE WE HAVE
A SENIOR CITIZEN AMONG US.

18:01.580 --> 18:03.040
- EXCUSE ME?

18:03.123 --> 18:06.043
BUT I AM HARDLY
A SENIOR CITIZEN.

18:06.126 --> 18:08.545
SO CLEARLY YOU'RE MAKING SOME
KIND OF A JOKE AT MY EXPENSE.

18:08.629 --> 18:11.340
WELL, I'M NOT GONNA PUT UP
WITH IT.

18:11.423 --> 18:12.674
NOT FROM YOU,
PROFESSOR,

18:12.758 --> 18:15.344
OR YOU,
SMIRKY FRAT BOY,

18:15.427 --> 18:17.513
OR YOU,
SNARKY, NECK-TATTOO GIRL.

18:17.596 --> 18:20.057
OH, THAT'S GONNA LOOK GOOD
IN 30 YEARS.

18:20.140 --> 18:21.850
AND FRANKLY,
PROFESSOR,

18:21.934 --> 18:23.644
I WOULD THINK
THAT SOMEONE WHO SHAVES

18:23.727 --> 18:25.521
HIS HEAD TO HIDE
HIS PREMATURE BALDNESS

18:25.604 --> 18:27.731
WOULD BE A LITTLE MORE SENSITIVE
TO THE FACT

18:27.815 --> 18:30.526
THAT I CLEARLY DO NOT WANT
TO DRAW ATTENTION TO MYSELF!

18:30.609 --> 18:34.696
- [clears throat]

18:34.780 --> 18:38.742
I THINK
HE WAS TALKING TO ME.

18:41.119 --> 18:42.871
[knock at door]
- SWEETHEART?

18:42.955 --> 18:46.834
HELLO?

18:46.917 --> 18:48.919
- WE NEED TO TALK.
I--

18:49.002 --> 18:50.212
YOU'RE NOT WOODY.

18:50.295 --> 18:52.256
- VICTORIA,
IT'S ME, GARY.

18:52.339 --> 18:54.716
- GARY?

18:54.800 --> 18:56.593
- I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO STOP
THINKING ABOUT OUR LOVE-MAKING.

18:56.677 --> 18:58.512
IT WAS
FAR TOO BRIEF,

18:58.595 --> 19:01.014
FOR WHICH
I APOLOGIZE.

19:02.766 --> 19:06.603
- I'M SORRY, BUT I HAVE
ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHO YOU--

19:06.687 --> 19:08.564
OH, MY GOD.

19:08.647 --> 19:11.900
I SLEPT
WITH A CREW MEMBER.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.862
NO OFFENSE.
- NONE TAKEN.

19:14.945 --> 19:16.864
- BUT WAIT,
WE TALKED ABOUT THE SCRIPT.

19:16.947 --> 19:18.198
YOU SAID YOU'D SEE
WHAT YOU COULD DO.

19:18.282 --> 19:20.075
- I DID,
I DID.

19:20.158 --> 19:23.120
I SPOKE TO WOODY, AND YOU DON'T
HAVE TO GAIN A SINGLE POUND.

19:23.203 --> 19:27.291
BEING AN ASSISTANT DIRECTOR
HAS ITS PERKS.

19:27.374 --> 19:28.625
WHO DID YOU THINK
I WAS?

19:28.709 --> 19:30.878
- OH, SURELY I'M NOT THE FIRST
TO NOTICE THAT,

19:30.961 --> 19:33.797
IN THE RIGHT LIGHT
OR NO LIGHT AT ALL,

19:33.881 --> 19:35.883
YOU SOUND EXACTLY
LIKE WOODY ALLEN.

19:35.966 --> 19:40.053
- LOOK, HE'S HAD THE SAME CREW
FOR THE LAST 30 YEARS.

19:40.137 --> 19:41.930
WHEN YOU WORK
WITH A MAN THAT LONG,

19:42.014 --> 19:44.600
I SUPPOSE IT'S ONLY LOGICAL
THAT SOME OF HIS MANNERISMS,

19:44.683 --> 19:46.476
YOU KNOW,
MIGHT RUB OFF.

19:49.062 --> 19:51.273
DESHAWN, WHAT'S UP?

19:51.356 --> 19:55.402
- GARY...

19:55.485 --> 19:57.738
I'M AFRAID
THERE'S BEEN A MINOR INCIDENT

19:57.821 --> 19:59.114
IN THE MAKEUP TRAILER.

20:09.875 --> 20:11.209
- SO WHY, ELKA?

20:11.293 --> 20:13.295
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
YOU WERE IN SCHOOL?

20:13.378 --> 20:16.298
- I HAVE MY REASONS.

20:16.381 --> 20:17.633
- AND WHY ECONOMICS?

20:17.716 --> 20:20.802
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT
UP YOUR KLEENEX-FILLED SLEEVE?

20:20.886 --> 20:22.763
- NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

20:25.599 --> 20:28.685
- OH, SORRY.

20:28.769 --> 20:30.938
OH, MY GOD.

20:31.021 --> 20:33.482
WHAT'S ALL THIS MONEY?

20:33.565 --> 20:35.609
- WHAT MONEY?
