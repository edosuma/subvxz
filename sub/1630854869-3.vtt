Hi, this is Joey Shorter
with Brightside Lunar Residences.

01:02.646 --> 01:04.105
How can I be of assistance...

01:11.738 --> 01:14.157
Imagine with me, Mrs. McKenna,

01:14.157 --> 01:18.120
those zinnias stretching skyward
in reduced gravity.

01:18.120 --> 01:19.621
- What a sight.
- One minute, exactly.

01:19.621 --> 01:21.498
Holographic wallpaper? You got it.

01:21.498 --> 01:22.958
Of course. I'll call you back.

01:22.958 --> 01:25.085
You know, you feel like family,
Howard. You do.

01:25.085 --> 01:28.589
Which is why I'm gonna get you
the very same deal I got my own ma.

01:28.589 --> 01:30.215
No. Hold on one second, sir.

01:30.215 --> 01:33.385
Shirl, chalk me up a B-Plex.
Lot B5, crater-view.

01:33.385 --> 01:36.972
Herb, you come fry a ham steak
on my bare chest over here,

01:36.972 --> 01:39.558
because I am just so hot, baby.

01:39.558 --> 01:41.727
Ed, stop. I don't have a ham steak.

01:41.727 --> 01:45.314
God forbid, Jack, I disappoint you
with another one of these ads.

01:45.314 --> 01:46.690
We might all end up rich.

01:46.690 --> 01:51.153
Well, then we'll call it even
on you being dead wrong on the new kid.

01:51.153 --> 01:52.863
Would you like a strong coffee pot?

01:52.863 --> 01:54.948
Hey, who wants to mop this one up?
Easy money.

01:54.948 --> 01:57.409
- Joey, you could take it.
- Yeah, I got it, Jack.

01:58.535 --> 02:01.496
Hi, this is Joey Shorter
with Brightside Lunar Residences.

02:02.122 --> 02:03.999
It's great
that you heard our ad on the radio.

02:03.999 --> 02:07.419
It's too bad about our Volts,
but we'll shock 'em next time, right?

02:07.419 --> 02:09.253
Okay. Patch me in, Shirl.

02:09.253 --> 02:12.216
Careful, Herb.
New kid's coming for your lunch money.

02:12.841 --> 02:14.384
Now, if you could just give me...

02:17.095 --> 02:22.267
I'm a guy who takes "No" for,
"Let's just keep talking until 'yes.'"

02:22.267 --> 02:25.229
You've gotta be proud, Mrs. Shizlitski,
with your son in the lunar mines.

02:25.229 --> 02:26.980
And what could make him happier

02:26.980 --> 02:32.236
than his beloved ma being a quarter
of a million miles closer to him, right?

02:33.153 --> 02:34.947
Hey Shirl, patch me in again.

02:34.947 --> 02:37.407
I got another one. It's a C-Plex, C12.

02:38.700 --> 02:40.911
Welcome to second place, kid.

02:42.871 --> 02:46.458
Where's Herb? Did he just hear that
and jump out the window?

02:46.458 --> 02:48.293
You know what? It's getting late.

02:49.002 --> 02:51.922
Let's call it a night,
stay fresh for tomorrow's leads.

02:51.922 --> 02:53.632
I'm all good to keep going, Jack.

02:53.632 --> 02:55.300
You stay that hungry, kid.

02:55.300 --> 02:58.136
Desperation, a salesman's greatest asset.

02:58.136 --> 02:59.513
I am living proof of that.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.390
This kid's got some real dog in him.

03:01.390 --> 03:03.976
He stole second place,
and all he wants is more.

03:04.726 --> 03:07.646
Let's knock off and run a victory lap.

03:12.401 --> 03:14.862
Take this then. That's all of it.

03:14.862 --> 03:19.658
Great. You'll be thrilled to know
that you are now likely to be working

03:19.658 --> 03:22.744
with the team's
number two top seller this evening.

03:23.412 --> 03:24.788
I'll get you on the first launch out.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.875
Jesus, am I supposed to read all this?

03:28.375 --> 03:29.376
Technically, yes.

03:30.377 --> 03:32.880
But time is your most precious asset.

03:40.637 --> 03:41.638
That's it.

03:43.599 --> 03:45.434
You won't be disappointed, ma'am.

03:45.434 --> 03:48.687
The next quarterly launch is scheduled
in just a few quick months.

03:48.687 --> 03:53.192
Months? No. That's not possible.

03:53.192 --> 03:56.820
We're not talking about
a bus to Sun City, ma'am.

03:57.779 --> 04:00.824
This is a state-of-the-art rocket launch,
scheduled quarterly,

04:01.325 --> 04:02.993
as contractually specified.

04:07.456 --> 04:10.125
- So, I'll just go get this processed.
- No.

04:10.125 --> 04:11.376
You don't understand!

04:12.920 --> 04:14.338
I have to go now.

04:14.922 --> 04:18.966
You're on the same great schedule
as all our customers.

04:21.928 --> 04:28.143
But I also don't believe in impossible,
so I'll be Mr. Do-All-I-Can for you.

04:28.143 --> 04:29.353
First thing tomorrow morning.

04:30.771 --> 04:35.150
But... I have nowhere else to go.

04:40.781 --> 04:43.033
Can I help you with transportation?

04:44.159 --> 04:48.664
A man of your accomplishments
needs a drink in his hands.

04:49.831 --> 04:53.502
One day on the road to a lifetime.

04:54.878 --> 04:56.088
Thanks, Jack.

04:56.088 --> 04:57.548
Wow, this is really great.

05:00.425 --> 05:04.304
You know, I sold one
to my old algebra teacher, Mr. Klein.

05:05.931 --> 05:09.685
I was just thinking about him up there
one day, you know, looking down at us.

05:10.185 --> 05:13.313
And it's all thanks to me.
Kinda. You know?

05:16.024 --> 05:17.943
Wow, look at that.

05:17.943 --> 05:22.322
Look at that.

05:23.198 --> 05:26.952
- Wow.
- Yeah, wow, that must be the 568.

05:26.952 --> 05:28.954
I should've brought the whole gang
out here to see it.

05:28.954 --> 05:31.373
- That's one of ours?
- Yeah, I think so. Must be.

05:32.749 --> 05:35.794
Oh, man,
it'd be great to see one up close one day.

05:35.794 --> 05:37.880
Oh, kid, just you wait.

05:43.635 --> 05:46.388
Okay. Yeah, I should grab the bus.

05:46.388 --> 05:48.599
It's getting pretty late
to be stopping by Mom.

05:50.767 --> 05:56.023
Or, at this hour, I mean,
we can get you a room here for the night.

05:57.441 --> 05:58.275
Yeah?

06:00.819 --> 06:02.070
I mean, I don't really need--

06:02.070 --> 06:05.616
You are way past the business
of what you need, kid.

06:05.616 --> 06:07.951
It's time for what you deserve.

06:13.832 --> 06:15.834
You know where this would look
a whole lot nicer?

06:15.834 --> 06:17.002
On you, Shirley.

06:17.002 --> 06:21.256
Kinda confetti-strewn,
little to no other garments, or--

06:21.256 --> 06:24.051
Am I getting ahead of myself
by about 12 minutes here?

06:27.012 --> 06:28.222
But who's measuring, right?

06:28.805 --> 06:31.058
Abundance is fucking abundance, Shirley.

06:31.058 --> 06:35.229
Your abundance is fixing my car
and your problems tomorrow.

06:35.229 --> 06:37.898
Problems, car, tomorrow. Ding, ding, ding.

06:37.898 --> 06:41.944
All right, you guys. Have a good night
and just, thanks for everything.

06:41.944 --> 06:43.570
It's Captain Puberty.

06:43.570 --> 06:45.239
How you doing? You all good for bus fare?

06:45.239 --> 06:48.200
Ignore him, Joe. He's terrified
of anyone younger than he is.

06:48.867 --> 06:50.577
No, Jack's grabbing me a room, actually.

06:51.370 --> 06:54.206
Okay. You gonna be ready
to pack out with us tomorrow?

06:55.207 --> 06:58.001
Pack out? What about
all the great leads we've got here?

06:58.001 --> 06:59.461
Day's work, then wheels up.

06:59.461 --> 07:01.421
We're lucky we got all we did
out of this town.

07:01.421 --> 07:04.925
Right. So there's never someone
who sticks around just to work local?

07:04.925 --> 07:06.927
Well, that's kind of the thing
about traveling salesmen, kid.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.345
They do tend to travel.

07:08.971 --> 07:11.974
Shirley, you wanna go grab
that sizable form I mentioned?

07:12.766 --> 07:15.853
It's okay if the road's not for you, Joe.
You did good tonight.

07:16.353 --> 07:17.604
Yeah, you did.

07:18.105 --> 07:20.023
We'll send you a card
on your 12th birthday.

07:21.108 --> 07:23.235
Have a wonderful evening.

07:23.235 --> 07:25.279
Joe. Jack's not here?

07:25.279 --> 07:26.572
You just missed him. Why?

07:27.865 --> 07:29.449
Certain developments is all.

07:29.449 --> 07:32.870
Regarding fairness,
which always favors the actual winners.

07:33.704 --> 07:37.040
Good evening, guest.
How can I make your stay more pleasant?

07:40.043 --> 07:46.008
<i>Every man's a king, Herb-O
As long as every man is me, Herb-O</i>

07:46.008 --> 07:50.429
<i>Oh, she loves me, she loves me
Oh, oh, oh</i>

07:50.429 --> 07:52.264
Oh, Jesus! Who are you?

07:53.015 --> 07:55.100
- You're not Herb at all.
- He told me I could sleep here.

07:55.100 --> 07:58.812
Boy, for a mealy-minded,
congenitally limp fella like him--

07:58.812 --> 07:59.897
Get out! Go!

07:59.897 --> 08:01.356
All right, forgive me,

08:01.356 --> 08:04.401
hot-blooded woman
who is way outta Herb's league.

08:04.401 --> 08:07.946
This is half my room as well,
but no, I'll gladly vacate.

08:07.946 --> 08:11.617
Wait, hey. He said he would
get me on an earlier launch. Did he?

08:11.617 --> 08:15.621
Oh, God, Herb.
Good luck, toots. Seriously.

08:19.416 --> 08:23.086
<i>Jacky boy,
you're hoarding my handsome grandson.</i>

08:23.670 --> 08:27.382
<i>Sure, you're ashamed of me,
but don't overestimate my patience.</i>

08:28.258 --> 08:29.259
Delete.

08:29.927 --> 08:34.765
<i>Every day you're here
and not delivering Joey, who I am owed,</i>

08:34.765 --> 08:36.600
<i>I die faster.</i>

08:36.600 --> 08:37.683
Delete.

08:38.644 --> 08:40.062
Down in a flash.

08:40.062 --> 08:41.772
I need a minute, Jack.

08:43.273 --> 08:44.274
Fuck.

08:44.274 --> 08:47.069
All right,
anything for you, Shirl, anytime.

08:55.953 --> 08:59.289
- Hey.
- Fifteen units in three hours.

08:59.289 --> 09:04.294
Considering we did 48 the last three
months, I'd call it an eventful evening.

09:04.294 --> 09:07.589
You know--
Could you help me pick out a tie?

09:09.925 --> 09:14.471
Yes, we are making big waves.
Big, big, big, big waves.

09:14.471 --> 09:17.224
You know,
I shouldn't be thinking like this,

09:17.224 --> 09:19.768
but if Jenkins hits us with
more delays now,

09:19.768 --> 09:22.271
this whole town is gonna grab pitchforks.

09:22.271 --> 09:24.565
Well, that'll be HQ's problem
'cause we'll be long gone.

09:24.565 --> 09:27.442
That is the right call, Shirl.

09:27.943 --> 09:30.279
Oak Grove has a county fair tomorrow.

09:30.279 --> 09:31.780
I got prices on ad buys.

09:31.780 --> 09:34.741
Plus,
a regional spread plan profit projection.

09:35.492 --> 09:37.619
Lots of potential
we never had the stones to tap.

09:37.619 --> 09:42.875
This is also all stuff that you are
not paid enough to worry about.

09:42.875 --> 09:45.210
Well, whosever job it is,
I'm better at it.

09:48.005 --> 09:51.175
I'm not saying ambition
doesn't look great on you. It does.

09:51.175 --> 09:52.634
But let's...

09:55.220 --> 09:56.346
Let's just hit the road.

09:57.055 --> 10:01.226
Keep working doors like we know how.
Crawl before we corner the market.

10:01.226 --> 10:03.312
Of course.
Who doesn't wanna make less money?

10:03.312 --> 10:05.647
Me, Shirl.

10:05.647 --> 10:09.193
I've got a boss, and bosses are violent,
irrational creatures,

10:09.193 --> 10:13.155
especially when you start spending
their budgets however the hell you want.

10:15.866 --> 10:20.954
One day, when Brightside's bigger than
sliced bread and you and me run the show,

10:20.954 --> 10:23.957
we will be rich enough
to make up our own rules.

10:25.792 --> 10:27.211
Ready when you are.

10:27.211 --> 10:28.670
Hey, Jack, it's me.

10:29.505 --> 10:30.797
Too bad Joey won't travel.

10:30.797 --> 10:33.634
- I see some of what you're seeing.
- Won't travel?

10:35.677 --> 10:37.054
Jack, you got a minute?

10:38.222 --> 10:39.348
- Hey, good morning.
- Hey.

10:39.348 --> 10:40.432
Hey, Shirl.

10:40.432 --> 10:43.310
I was just coming by
to say thanks for everything.

10:43.310 --> 10:44.770
I gotta go home.

10:44.770 --> 10:47.397
Well, hey-- Let me give you a ride. Okay?

10:47.397 --> 10:48.732
Got something I wanna show you.

10:48.732 --> 10:49.816
Let's go.

10:50.901 --> 10:52.444
It only looked like I was in last place,

10:52.444 --> 10:55.572
and that's with Jack
handing this Joey certain advantages,

10:55.572 --> 10:58.283
which he needs, of course,
given his total lack of expertise.

10:58.283 --> 11:03.080
<i>Herbie, you're not letting life
on the road get to you again, are you?</i>

11:03.080 --> 11:06.124
- <i>Remember, we're stronger than that.</i>
- Much stronger.

11:06.124 --> 11:07.709
<i>So much stro--</i>

11:08.836 --> 11:11.797
<i>Wait, Herbie, what is that scarf?</i>

11:12.756 --> 11:14.633
<i>That women's scarf there on your bed.</i>

11:19.388 --> 11:25.185
You see, honey, I can't say
for certain what that scarf is or whose,

11:25.185 --> 11:28.188
because I was not present
when it was left there.

11:28.188 --> 11:30.774
<i>I'm alone, every day.</i>

11:30.774 --> 11:36.363
<i>And I'm here for you, your eternal rock,
with our twins growing inside me,</i>

11:36.363 --> 11:41.451
<i>and you have a scarf. You have a scarf!</i>

11:45.122 --> 11:47.541
A car like this.
All the home a salesman ever needs.

11:48.125 --> 11:51.003
- Oh, man.
- Hey, don't be shy, kid, open her up.

11:51.545 --> 11:53.338
- You sure?
- Yeah, see what she got.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.048
Here goes nothing.

12:04.641 --> 12:06.685
That's right, kid.
Ten and two, right there, you got it.

12:06.685 --> 12:08.270
This thing's pretty powerful.

12:08.270 --> 12:09.646
Yeah, it is.

12:10.814 --> 12:16.236
So, Joe, we head out tonight,
and I would be honored

12:16.737 --> 12:22.409
to have the most promising rookie salesman
I've ever met in convoy with us.

12:22.409 --> 12:24.912
And you can drive your new car here too.

12:25.412 --> 12:26.830
What do you mean?

12:27.414 --> 12:30.834
What, you don't like it? We'll swap
it out, but frankly, I think it suits you.

12:31.793 --> 12:33.170
You didn't buy this for me.

12:33.170 --> 12:38.383
You didn't think any of this would be
as good as it is, but... here we are.

12:51.522 --> 12:53.065
You know, it's just--

12:55.400 --> 12:58.237
- It's just too much. Jack, it's-- No.
- No.

12:58.237 --> 13:00.697
Don't get hung up, kid.
Call it a company car.

13:00.697 --> 13:03.075
You work with us, you get to drive it.
That simple.

13:03.075 --> 13:04.868
Yeah, you don't have to
sell me on it, Jack.

13:04.868 --> 13:06.828
I'm not going to go.

13:06.828 --> 13:09.623
I can't leave my mom.

13:14.211 --> 13:15.212
I can't.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.696
You haven't seen Jack, have you?

13:40.696 --> 13:44.283
Herb, my compliments. I met
your conjugal visitor from last night.

13:44.283 --> 13:46.577
Well, I was very wrong about you.

13:46.577 --> 13:50.205
You're actually very wrong
about being wrong about me.

13:50.205 --> 13:53.542
I provided her with our customer service
hotline, which should be very helpful.

13:53.542 --> 13:57.254
Now you're ducking her like a regular
Don Juan, and-- just-- It's shocking.

13:57.254 --> 14:00.257
No one's ducking or shocking or anything.

14:00.257 --> 14:02.342
Why does everyone think I'm a sex maniac?

14:02.342 --> 14:04.553
It's a fair question.
Let me ask you something.

14:04.553 --> 14:07.890
Now, you saw this in a shop window, huh?
Singing you a love song.

14:07.890 --> 14:11.310
Would you not put aside
certain other pertinent concerns?

14:11.310 --> 14:15.606
Look at this. Look at that.
AutoColor, huh? Goes with everything.

14:15.606 --> 14:16.815
Very impressive.

14:17.816 --> 14:20.110
Okay, just slowly walk away, okay?

14:20.694 --> 14:22.654
I know you have a million and one
stupid fucking questions.

14:22.654 --> 14:25.240
For once, please save them
and get outta here.

14:25.240 --> 14:26.366
Take that bag of money.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.327
Probably time I just give it to Shirl.

14:28.952 --> 14:30.287
Hey there, pal.

14:31.121 --> 14:34.666
There you are. I've been looking
all over for you, Fred.

14:35.792 --> 14:39.338
Third visit on this tab, Ed.
Third visits hurt.

14:39.338 --> 14:41.423
Great news. Payday is tomorrow.

14:41.423 --> 14:44.009
You'll find me right here, Fred.
Come on, you'll have every cent.

14:44.009 --> 14:46.637
Money or pain, pal. It's your call.

14:48.805 --> 14:52.142
Come on, you gotta have something on ya. Anything.

14:56.063 --> 14:57.356
Fred, I got nothing.

14:59.066 --> 15:00.108
You unlucky bum.

15:00.108 --> 15:03.278
All right, easy. Okay, hey.
Come on. Please?

15:03.779 --> 15:05.948
I can walk myself, all right? Big boy now.

15:07.074 --> 15:09.451
Have a wonderful afternoon.

15:09.451 --> 15:13.997
<i>Hello, and thank you for calling
the Brightside Lunar Residences,</i>

15:13.997 --> 15:16.750
<i>where you'll live
your brighter tomorrow today.</i>

15:16.750 --> 15:18.961
<i>For Sales, press one.</i>

15:18.961 --> 15:21.755
<i>For more about the Brightside, press two.</i>

15:24.258 --> 15:26.009
<i>For Sales, press one.</i>

15:26.593 --> 15:29.221
<i>For more about the Brightside, press two.</i>

15:29.221 --> 15:31.181
<i>Invalid entry.</i>

15:33.016 --> 15:39.815
<i>Invalid entry.</i>

15:42.693 --> 15:46.321
<i>Sorry, none of our sales associates
are available to take your call.</i>

16:03.130 --> 16:04.131
Follow.

16:25.194 --> 16:29.031
You cut me off,
but his name was "Herb Porter,"

16:29.031 --> 16:31.200
and he should be fired immediately

16:31.200 --> 16:33.619
because I never would have done this
if he hadn't let me think--

16:34.912 --> 16:37.497
And now I'm stuck here in this dingy motel

16:37.497 --> 16:41.293
with nothing in my suitcase
but goddamn loungewear for the moon.

16:42.836 --> 16:46.340
Waiting three months
with no home to go back to?

16:46.340 --> 16:48.592
I thought I was leaving right away.

16:48.592 --> 16:51.929
Do you know what it took to get here?

16:52.930 --> 16:56.266
Are these the offices
of Brightside Lunar "Redisences?"

16:56.266 --> 16:58.227
Yeah, what can I do for ya?

16:59.895 --> 17:04.148
I'll need to speak with the manager
or operationally deputized "sudorbinate."

17:04.775 --> 17:06.026
Yeah, guess I'll do.

17:07.236 --> 17:09.738
- Location of corporate enterprise?
- Excuse me?

17:09.738 --> 17:11.656
Location of corporate enterprise?

17:12.281 --> 17:13.282
Where's HQ, you mean?

17:14.076 --> 17:14.992
The moon.

17:16.787 --> 17:19.665
- Form 703C, please.
- Yeah, now you stumped me.

17:20.290 --> 17:21.541
Fetch 703C.

17:22.876 --> 17:26.588
Pursuant to the non-local entity's
unpermitted broadcast advertisements

17:26.588 --> 17:28.089
on WYBS,

17:28.089 --> 17:33.804
you are required to file
a 703C Statement of Disclosure.

17:33.804 --> 17:34.763
Down.

17:35.347 --> 17:39.393
Per entity, per transaction,
in "triclipate."

17:40.811 --> 17:42.646
Sorry, I wasn't aware.

17:42.646 --> 17:45.691
Which, ipso facto,
constitutes a violation.

17:46.275 --> 17:47.943
These are public airwaves, ma'am.

17:47.943 --> 17:51.488
We can't just allow anyone from anywhere
to say anything they want.

17:51.488 --> 17:54.074
Well, good thing
we're taking our business elsewhere,

17:54.074 --> 17:56.285
and you won't have to worry about our 73s.
Right--

17:56.285 --> 18:02.040
703C's. And yes, my jurisdiction's
confined to Vistaville county, but--

18:02.040 --> 18:04.042
Then write this down in "triclipate."

18:04.710 --> 18:07.421
I've spent 14 hours doing paperwork,
my wrists hurt,

18:07.421 --> 18:09.965
my fucking ass is numb,
and I've been daydreaming

18:09.965 --> 18:13.051
about stabbing just about anyone
in the eye with this pencil.

18:13.051 --> 18:16.972
Then comes you, stuffed in your $12 suit,

18:16.972 --> 18:20.392
asking an honest businesswoman
who's buried in forms

18:20.392 --> 18:22.102
for more useless goddamn forms.

18:22.102 --> 18:25.522
Now, please, get the fuck out,
and let me do my job.

18:26.106 --> 18:29.234
I'm no stranger to coarse language
and contempt.

18:29.234 --> 18:35.115
And while there's no rule against it,
it does make the process less pleasant.

18:36.575 --> 18:41.580
Your 16-hour compliance window
began with initial "nofitication..."

18:42.748 --> 18:43.749
three minutes ago.

18:44.333 --> 18:45.626
Follow.

18:47.586 --> 18:50.255
So, what else can I say?

18:50.255 --> 18:53.634
I got married at 17.
That was my first mistake.

18:53.634 --> 18:57.554
Any man who says, "We'll keep
the next baby," is a fucking liar.

18:57.554 --> 19:01.141
My mother's even worse,
but we covered her.

19:03.435 --> 19:04.895
Please get me out of here.

19:06.897 --> 19:08.899
Get me out of here.

19:08.899 --> 19:11.068
<i>We were unable to save your message.</i>

19:13.737 --> 19:15.405
<i>For sales, press one.</i>

19:19.201 --> 19:20.619
- Mr. Billings?
- Hey.

19:20.619 --> 19:22.454
I saw the garage needed work.

19:22.454 --> 19:24.540
Nothing a couple men with hammers
can't handle.

19:26.875 --> 19:27.876
Why you doing this?

19:27.876 --> 19:29.628
Well, because you're stuck, kid.

19:29.628 --> 19:32.214
And every time you see that,
it's dragging you down more.

19:32.214 --> 19:35.759
I get you can't come on the road with us,
but you can't stay here with that either.

19:35.759 --> 19:37.135
You got some tools in there?

19:38.887 --> 19:39.888
I can check.

19:52.651 --> 19:55.028
My mom just has trouble
getting rid of stuff.

19:56.196 --> 19:58.031
Here, you can check in there.

20:01.034 --> 20:02.077
Had a case like this once.

20:02.661 --> 20:04.371
Did you use it a lot as a kid?

20:05.372 --> 20:07.124
No. Mostly just called the handyman.

20:08.250 --> 20:09.251
This will do.

20:10.460 --> 20:12.713
I-- You can throw some paint
on the new ones.

20:14.631 --> 20:15.716
Okay.

20:21.847 --> 20:25.017
B-Plex.
Please inform Jack I dropped that off.

20:25.017 --> 20:27.811
Nice work, Herb. Tied for second.

20:27.811 --> 20:29.646
Hey, you wanna mark it up yourself?

20:33.150 --> 20:34.484
Who needs a check mark, right?

20:34.484 --> 20:39.656
I know what I did,
even if Jack doesn't, nor Joey.

20:39.656 --> 20:41.950
Don't beat yourself up.

20:41.950 --> 20:44.828
Whatever's going on with Jack
and that kid's got nothing to do with you.

20:45.621 --> 20:46.705
Thank you, Shirley.

20:47.206 --> 20:50.292
You know, sometimes I think
that Betty thinks that if I'm not...

20:51.919 --> 20:54.171
you know, number one,

20:54.171 --> 20:57.799
then there's something wrong.

20:59.593 --> 21:02.679
Well, maybe both of you
need to relax a little.

21:03.180 --> 21:07.684
Well, she doesn't really like us
using the R-word, Shirley.

21:17.486 --> 21:20.864
Hey, look, you're a good kid, and it's
noble that you wanna stick by your mom,

21:20.864 --> 21:23.575
but it's tough living your life
for someone else.

21:23.575 --> 21:25.953
Well, that's just how she raised me.

21:25.953 --> 21:27.287
You know, family first.

21:27.287 --> 21:29.498
Exactly, but aren't you a part of
that family too?

21:30.290 --> 21:31.458
Sure.

21:31.458 --> 21:35.587
Trust me, the world,
it's big enough for you to love her

21:35.587 --> 21:37.381
and do your own thing sometimes.

21:37.381 --> 21:38.966
Looks good, nice, and even.

21:40.050 --> 21:41.051
Thanks.

21:43.554 --> 21:45.430
You know, I've only ever left here once.

21:46.473 --> 21:48.725
No, it was game seven, Volts, Dynamos.

21:50.185 --> 21:52.020
So, it was 10 hours
on local buses right there.

21:52.604 --> 21:55.065
You got an adventurer's heart,
and you're living like a granny.

22:01.071 --> 22:02.531
How do you know people so good?

22:03.115 --> 22:04.449
Knocking on their doors.

22:05.534 --> 22:06.535
It's a hell of a classroom.

22:08.203 --> 22:10.080
Of course, I wanna go with you guys.

22:10.831 --> 22:13.667
I just don't wanna wind up some nobody. I...

22:19.673 --> 22:22.009
My pops left,
and that's what happened to him.

22:23.927 --> 22:25.679
He left her and never looked back.

22:30.225 --> 22:32.936
- You keep in touch with him ever?
- I don't even wanna know his name.

22:32.936 --> 22:35.022
- You sure?
- I could care less if he was dead.

22:38.025 --> 22:39.985
Well, then, I bet you'll turn out
way better than he did.

22:43.155 --> 22:46.700
And that's all your mom
really wants, anyway.

22:46.700 --> 22:48.702
I mean, now, I don't know her, but...

22:50.537 --> 22:52.831
moms aren't always built
for letting their boys go.

22:52.831 --> 22:56.793
Yeah, she'd probably
want me to stay here in this house

22:56.793 --> 22:58.712
with her for the rest of my life
if she had her way.

22:58.712 --> 23:00.464
You'd hate her if you never left.

23:02.841 --> 23:04.134
That I know.

23:04.885 --> 23:07.804
Plus, you'd be short a car and a career,
and a bunch of new friends,

23:07.804 --> 23:10.641
all of which could be yours
for the price of "Thanks, Jack."

23:18.815 --> 23:19.816
Thanks, Jack.

23:33.413 --> 23:34.873
Turndown service.

23:37.251 --> 23:39.461
- You shitty little bastard.
- Ma'am-- Miss.

23:40.045 --> 23:42.756
I believed you.
I left my whole life for this!

23:42.756 --> 23:44.299
What are you doing here?

23:46.760 --> 23:48.971
- Those are actually my roommate's.
- Well, fuck him too!

23:48.971 --> 23:50.681
You promised me this would happen!

23:51.265 --> 23:54.309
I don't have time to wait!
My whole life is ruined!

23:54.309 --> 23:57.062
Twelve years of marriage, just fucked!

23:57.062 --> 23:59.857
<i>Excuse me, Miss Tramp,</i>

23:59.857 --> 24:03.360
<i>if you're looking for your cheap scarf,
it's right over there.</i>

24:04.069 --> 24:05.153
<i>I knew it.</i>

24:13.078 --> 24:14.079
All right.

24:14.580 --> 24:17.040
Good afternoon, guest.
Can I help with your bags?

24:17.040 --> 24:19.126
- You're getting the hang of it.
- Sorta.

24:19.126 --> 24:20.919
So, there you are.

24:21.503 --> 24:24.423
Ma, hey. I wasn't expecting you.

24:25.007 --> 24:28.594
This is the--
a new recruit of ours. A great guy.

24:28.594 --> 24:30.429
Joey Shorter, my ma.

24:30.429 --> 24:32.139
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Mrs. Billings.

24:33.223 --> 24:36.101
God, you're handsome. Excuse me.

24:37.728 --> 24:40.272
All right, no, let him breathe, Ma.
Ma, first w-- it's his first week.

24:41.982 --> 24:47.779
I've been telling Jack
to recruit someone like you for years now.

24:47.779 --> 24:49.948
Tell me, is he treating you right?

24:49.948 --> 24:53.035
I know firsthand he can be cruel.

24:53.035 --> 24:55.162
Checked out, two-faced, you name it.

24:55.162 --> 24:56.705
Oh, no.

24:56.705 --> 24:58.874
He's been great, really.
He's been teaching me a lot.

24:58.874 --> 25:00.751
We're all hitting the road tonight, actually.

25:00.751 --> 25:01.835
Is that right?

25:02.920 --> 25:04.254
On the road?

25:04.254 --> 25:06.757
Lots of packing
and planning to do here, Ma.

25:06.757 --> 25:10.010
- But I'm glad you had a chance to meet.
- I hope to see you again, Mrs. Billings.

25:10.010 --> 25:11.512
I'm sure you will, Joey.

25:11.512 --> 25:16.266
You're a very special boy.
No matter what he says or does.

25:16.266 --> 25:18.936
- Okay.
- All right.

25:18.936 --> 25:20.521
Okay.

25:22.397 --> 25:24.441
Good afternoon, valued guest.

25:24.441 --> 25:25.901
Can I help you with transportation?

25:25.901 --> 25:28.612
- I'm coming with, Shirl.
- Good for you.

25:29.655 --> 25:30.739
And what's that?

25:31.740 --> 25:33.325
It's a company car.

25:33.325 --> 25:36.662
But, Jack says I can drive it a while.

25:40.457 --> 25:44.127
What sadistic thing
are you doing to that boy?

25:44.127 --> 25:46.672
He's fine, Ma. Okay? Just get in the car.

25:46.672 --> 25:49.049
You got to see him.
Everything's gonna be fine.

25:49.049 --> 25:54.137
You got him so pumped up full of hot air.
He's half nuts already.

25:54.137 --> 25:59.768
Abandoning his mother on her deathbed
to "hit the road"

25:59.768 --> 26:02.479
when you can't even cop to being his dad.

26:02.479 --> 26:04.773
I'm gonna tell him soon.
What do you think I am?

26:04.773 --> 26:06.316
I know what you are, Jack.

26:06.316 --> 26:09.903
You're the guy who's gonna rip him away
from everything decent.

26:09.903 --> 26:14.283
- Straight out of your father's playbook.
- Dad didn't run out. He died.

26:14.283 --> 26:16.910
And you think that's not his fault?

26:17.786 --> 26:20.414
I know what it is
to live with a lunatic, Jack.

26:21.456 --> 26:23.417
So I'm gonna be looking out for that boy.

26:24.001 --> 26:28.422
Well, I better warn him, 'cause every guy
you look out for winds up suicidal.

26:29.006 --> 26:30.716
- Suck it up.
- Bye, Ma.

26:30.716 --> 26:34.636
Run away, Jack. Go on, run away.

26:45.522 --> 26:46.607
Shirley.

26:46.607 --> 26:48.442
Hey. Loaded up?

26:49.943 --> 26:53.071
What's better than leaving this town
and never coming back, am I right?

26:53.906 --> 26:57.910
You did forget to--

26:57.910 --> 26:59.912
Well, you forgot to pack this, though.

27:03.957 --> 27:05.167
Let's just see.

27:09.421 --> 27:11.423
What about your other issues?

27:11.423 --> 27:15.761
Jesus. A jewel like that, and you're gonna
waste time talking to me about issues?

27:22.017 --> 27:25.312
<i>Ay, ay, ay</i>. It's beautiful, Ed.

27:27.856 --> 27:29.233
It's huge.

27:31.151 --> 27:32.152
Knockout.

27:35.280 --> 27:37.199
- What's wrong with your leg?
- Nothing.

27:37.199 --> 27:40.702
- Walk over here then.
- No. I'm no trained seal.

27:40.702 --> 27:42.621
I happen to like it over here.

27:44.331 --> 27:46.083
What,
you gonna stand over there all night?

27:46.083 --> 27:47.793
Get over here and kiss me.

27:52.172 --> 27:53.674
You miserable fool.

27:53.674 --> 27:57.594
Yeah, maybe, but ain't I lucky, though?

28:03.308 --> 28:04.309
Here.

28:05.394 --> 28:07.521
- What?
- Everyone else plays fast and loose.

28:07.521 --> 28:09.064
- Why can't we?
- What?

28:10.607 --> 28:13.443
Just take care of what you have to,
and pay it back soon.

28:13.443 --> 28:18.282
Shirl, there is an air of miracle
and salvation about all this. There is.

28:18.782 --> 28:20.284
- Don't milk it.
- Okay, no.

28:21.201 --> 28:24.371
Milk... keeps coming up
over and over again.

28:24.371 --> 28:28.000
- No, I'm telling you.
- No, enough with the juju talk.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.585
- I--
- Gimme them lips.

28:39.511 --> 28:42.598
So, you're maybe
not gonna wanna hear this, but...

28:44.391 --> 28:46.768
Sure, he can stay here

28:47.269 --> 28:50.814
and spend his life getting antsy,
wondering what he's capable of,

28:50.814 --> 28:55.694
or he could do what makes him
feel like he's got a chance in the world.

28:56.528 --> 28:58.614
And you don't wanna take that away
from him.

29:01.450 --> 29:04.369
So what if it screws him up
a hundred different ways?

29:04.369 --> 29:06.663
At least he'll come by it honest.

29:18.634 --> 29:20.385
He's incredible. You know that.

29:24.056 --> 29:25.265
You did that.

29:31.104 --> 29:32.689
And, boy, he loves you.

29:33.732 --> 29:36.652
He'd lay down his dreams
just to stay by your side.

29:37.986 --> 29:39.571
At least, till I got involved.

29:44.034 --> 29:46.620
God, he knows things at his age
I might never learn.

30:08.684 --> 30:09.768
So, fine.

30:13.522 --> 30:15.816
I get it. We'll stay.

30:17.067 --> 30:18.443
What's the big rush, right?

30:24.283 --> 30:26.535
Visiting hours are for family only.

30:29.162 --> 30:30.414
I'm her husband.

30:34.001 --> 30:35.669
How 'bout another round?

30:38.297 --> 30:39.298
Jesus.

30:40.591 --> 30:43.510
Whoever called this a porterhouse
should be taken out and shot.

30:44.928 --> 30:45.929
Well, ma'am...

30:47.848 --> 30:52.060
quite often what the menu listed
as USDA Prime

30:52.686 --> 30:55.189
is only grade "stadnart--" standard.

30:55.689 --> 30:56.773
That's criminal.

30:59.234 --> 31:01.028
Technically, you're right.

31:06.867 --> 31:07.868
Thank you.

31:08.452 --> 31:11.747
You know, I was on the phone
for four hours today,

31:11.747 --> 31:14.875
and no one's listening. Not a soul.
I might as well be a goddamn doormat.

31:16.585 --> 31:18.128
Fetch F27EZ.

31:22.049 --> 31:24.510
You're not a doormat, ma'am.
You're a customer.

31:31.475 --> 31:33.936
And customers have rights.

31:35.521 --> 31:37.648
And it's my job to protect them.
