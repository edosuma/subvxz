WEBVTT

00:03.235 --> 00:06.364
- Good morning, loved ones!
- Nice outfit.

00:06.439 --> 00:09.203
Where's your giant,
foam-rubber Wolverine head?

00:09.876 --> 00:12.242
Don't be silly.
You can't get those anymore.

00:12.345 --> 00:14.609
Yes, I realize I am dressed up.

00:14.681 --> 00:18.048
But you see, to a Michigan fan,
football is a religion.

00:18.118 --> 00:21.884
And the Ohio State game,
well, that's our Easter.

00:21.955 --> 00:24.515
- So that reminds me...
- I like your clothes, Dad.

00:24.591 --> 00:26.855
- Thank you.
- "I like your clothes, Dad."

00:26.926 --> 00:29.861
Guys, please.
This is my one sacred day of the year.

00:29.929 --> 00:32.898
There's a sale
on blue and gold body paint.

00:32.966 --> 00:36.732
You could smear it all over your body
and watch the game in the nude.

00:37.537 --> 00:39.698
My people call it blue and maize.

00:39.773 --> 00:42.799
Not really good colors on you.
You're more of a...

00:42.876 --> 00:44.434
I know, I'm more of a spring.

00:44.544 --> 00:47.377
A spring? Ha! You wish.
He's such a winter.

00:47.447 --> 00:51.076
Back to the plan. I am commandeering
the television set all day,

00:51.151 --> 00:53.881
starting with the
first pre-game show. Got it?

00:53.953 --> 00:55.181
- All right.
- Whatever.

00:55.255 --> 00:59.487
- [zapping on video game]
- Rory, that means no video games.

00:59.559 --> 01:02.722
You kidding? I don't wanna
watch a violent sport like football.

01:04.096 --> 01:06.122
Hey, I killed 'em!
I killed 'em all!

01:06.199 --> 01:07.962
Off! Off!

01:09.402 --> 01:12.166
Bridget, did you
borrow my beige purse?

01:12.238 --> 01:15.366
Yeah, to go with my beige
double-knit jumpsuit.

01:16.709 --> 01:18.677
Wow, very nice.

01:18.745 --> 01:22.408
You know, first grad school seminar.
I want to make a good impression.

01:22.482 --> 01:25.576
How? By turning on all the guys?
I don't think so.

01:25.652 --> 01:30.612
You march upstairs, young lady, and
don't come down until you look frumpy.

01:30.723 --> 01:33.419
Which I realize
is virtually impossible.

01:33.493 --> 01:35.654
Come on, Paul, I'm nervous enough.

01:35.728 --> 01:38.094
I haven't set foot
in a classroom in 16 years.

01:38.198 --> 01:40.632
- You're gonna do great.
- Wow, 16 years.

01:40.700 --> 01:42.793
That's like my entire life.

01:45.004 --> 01:47.768
I'm aware of that, Bridget.

01:47.874 --> 01:49.501
And there's a connection.

01:50.176 --> 01:52.610
- Why are you dressed like that?
- It's Easter.

01:52.679 --> 01:56.012
The Ohio State game.
Why didn't you say something?

01:56.082 --> 01:59.245
Because you've been dreaming
about your Master's forever.

01:59.319 --> 02:02.755
And, you know, it's not like I go
to the game every year or anything.

02:02.822 --> 02:05.313
- Yes, you do.
- Yes, I do, but, honey,

02:05.391 --> 02:07.222
you've been waiting for this day.

02:07.293 --> 02:09.454
I can raise these kids
with my eyes closed.

02:09.529 --> 02:12.760
You just leave out some food
and crack the window a bit.

02:12.832 --> 02:15.300
Yet you cannot even
put your dish in the sink?

02:15.368 --> 02:19.134
Handled. Kids, put my dish
in the sink. See, I'm on fire.

02:20.140 --> 02:22.472
I'm completely reassured.

02:23.276 --> 02:25.938
I have my cell phone
if there's any problems.

02:26.012 --> 02:29.277
Like there's a fire and your dad
won't get up or a pipe bursts

02:29.349 --> 02:31.510
and your dad won't get up.
Or locusts...

02:31.584 --> 02:34.075
Locusts!
I would get up for locusts.

02:34.154 --> 02:36.714
- I mean it, call me.
- Not gonna happen. Here.

02:36.789 --> 02:40.225
OK, just make sure that Kerry
doesn't mope around all day.

02:40.293 --> 02:43.456
Oh, and get Rory away
from that video and out of the house.

02:43.563 --> 02:45.326
No moping, video games.
No problem.

02:45.431 --> 02:48.161
Oh, and keep Bridget off the phone
and out of the mall.

02:48.234 --> 02:50.395
I'm a man, not a miracle worker.

03:12.592 --> 03:15.755
[announcer on TV indistinct]

03:15.862 --> 03:18.592
I'm bored.
When's the game gonna be over?

03:19.699 --> 03:21.826
Are you serious?
It hasn't started yet.

03:22.969 --> 03:28.305
I don't want you playing video games.
You can't just sit and vegetate.

03:28.374 --> 03:30.604
Yeah, Dad's already doing that.

03:30.677 --> 03:31.644
And parenting.

03:31.744 --> 03:34.975
Now, come on everybody, quiet down.
I want to watch the game.

03:35.048 --> 03:38.984
- Go outside and get some fresh air.
- OK, I'll go ride my skateboard.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.816
Go ride your skateboard.
Be sure to wear your helmet

03:41.921 --> 03:45.948
and your elbow pads and your knee...
At least I said it.

03:46.459 --> 03:50.486
- Daddy, which do you like better?
- I love all my children the same.

03:50.563 --> 03:53.930
Oh, you mean the pants?
Bridget, I'm trying to watch...

03:54.000 --> 03:57.094
- You care what I think?
- Take the fashion show outside.

03:57.170 --> 04:00.196
Those of us who can
are trying to read.

04:00.273 --> 04:02.901
See, Kerry,
it can matter how you dress.

04:02.976 --> 04:05.342
- I mean, if you have hips.
- You have zits?

04:05.411 --> 04:08.574
- No, no, I said hips.
- You mean like childbearing hips.

04:08.681 --> 04:11.172
- Shut up!
- Don't talk to your sister like that.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.014
- You always take her side!
- I don't.

04:13.086 --> 04:16.522
- Yeah, OK, you never take my side.
- I take your side a lot.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.079
- Like all the time.
- No.

04:18.156 --> 04:20.853
Name one time you've taken my side.

04:23.162 --> 04:25.027
I have lots of times in my mind,

04:25.098 --> 04:27.726
but I'm not gonna dignify that
with a response.

04:27.800 --> 04:30.360
- I'm waiting.
- OK, OK. The red ones.

04:30.436 --> 04:33.132
Finally. Dad likes these.
They're perfect for you.

04:33.206 --> 04:36.266
I hate you
and your stupid red pants.

04:36.342 --> 04:38.572
Girls, don't kill each other!

04:39.545 --> 04:41.570
At least I said it.

04:44.651 --> 04:47.882
Check this out, Bear,
they're recapping the '78 season.

04:47.954 --> 04:50.514
My whole fraternity
went to every game that year.

04:50.623 --> 04:52.181
[groans]

04:57.664 --> 05:00.132
- Something wrong?
- No.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.825
Wow.

05:04.404 --> 05:07.339
Something's bothering you.
What is it, Care Bear?

05:08.675 --> 05:13.578
- I just saw this ad.
- Hey, the Big Top's in town.

05:14.747 --> 05:17.511
My little girl
wants to go to the circus,

05:17.617 --> 05:19.585
but you're too embarrassed to ask.

05:20.787 --> 05:24.245
Monkey. You want to see the monkeys.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.848
It's disgusting.

05:25.925 --> 05:30.362
The way they treat circus animals
is cruel and your paper's promoting it!

05:30.430 --> 05:32.523
- Uh-huh.
- Dad!

05:33.900 --> 05:36.061
God, you never care about
what I care about!

05:36.169 --> 05:38.797
I do. And I'll care even more
when this game's over.

05:39.439 --> 05:41.373
Unbelievable!

05:41.441 --> 05:44.877
God, you know, would it kill you
to take the time to listen to me?

05:44.944 --> 05:48.311
Hey, I always have time to listen
to you. Just not right now.

05:49.015 --> 05:50.539
[phone ringing]

05:50.616 --> 05:53.380
- You're like the worst father ever.
- I heard that.

05:53.453 --> 05:56.183
See, I do listen.

05:56.255 --> 05:58.883
- Hello?
- Listen to who?

05:58.958 --> 06:01.518
Um... Kerry. We were having
a heart-to-heart.

06:01.594 --> 06:05.030
- [Kerry] Hate! Hate! Hate!
- She says hi, hi, hi.

06:05.098 --> 06:07.566
- So how is everything?
- Well, I just got here.

06:07.633 --> 06:11.399
I forgot to pick up my allergy medicine.
Could you drop by the pharmacy?

06:11.471 --> 06:14.804
Oh, man.
You know I hate buying that stuff.

06:14.874 --> 06:18.207
No, no, no, it's really
allergy medicine this time.

06:19.512 --> 06:22.811
OK, yeah, I'll get it for you, Cate.

06:22.882 --> 06:26.841
It's hard... You're breaking up now.
Call me later, bye-bye.

06:28.621 --> 06:32.580
I'm studying with Courtney. I remembered
my cell phone and I need $40.

06:32.658 --> 06:35.718
You need $40 to study?
No, no. No.

06:35.795 --> 06:38.355
No, no, no, no, no.
No mall today.

06:38.464 --> 06:40.557
- What gave it away?
- The $40.

06:40.633 --> 06:44.660
Cupcake, I'm not inclined to let you
go somewhere if you lie to me about it.

06:44.737 --> 06:49.174
- OK, can I go to the mall?
- See, doesn't the truth feel better?

06:50.309 --> 06:51.833
No, you can't go.

06:52.378 --> 06:55.404
Dad, I promised Courtney.
You asking me to go back on my word?

06:55.481 --> 06:58.814
I will, but that is such bad parenting.

06:58.885 --> 07:02.651
I don't have time to explain to you
everything wrong with that statement.

07:02.722 --> 07:06.089
So you have this
obsessive-compulsive need to shop?

07:06.192 --> 07:10.526
OK. Go pick up your mother's
allergy medicine at the drugstore.

07:10.596 --> 07:13.087
Oh, Dad, grow up.
Pick it up yourself.

07:13.166 --> 07:15.862
No, it's really allergy medicine
this time.

07:15.935 --> 07:17.960
- Dad!
- Come on, take it or leave it.

07:18.538 --> 07:21.234
Fine. Like I want to sit
with Psycho Sister babbling

07:21.307 --> 07:23.537
about the poor
unfortunate circus animals.

07:23.609 --> 07:26.578
I mean, God, maybe the bears
wanna dance, OK?

07:27.346 --> 07:29.280
It beats catching fish with your hands.

07:29.348 --> 07:31.976
Bridget. Bye-bye, Bridget.

07:34.854 --> 07:38.153
- Kerry, sweetheart.
- [announcer on TV] Holy Toledo,

07:38.224 --> 07:40.954
Henderson's got it at the 15,
jukes to the 20!

07:41.027 --> 07:43.996
He's got some blocking
down at the 30.

07:44.096 --> 07:46.564
Fumbles! Who's got the ball?

07:52.171 --> 07:54.935
- Kerry? Care Bear?
- [Kerry] Go away!

07:55.007 --> 07:56.975
Honey, I just wanted to...

07:57.076 --> 08:01.604
[announcer on TV] I don't believe it!
Michigan recovers! Michigan recovers!

08:05.184 --> 08:07.812
- You just wanted to what?
- Talk.

08:07.887 --> 08:09.752
OK. What?

08:09.822 --> 08:12.655
Honey, if it'll make you feel
any better, I'm sorry.

08:15.394 --> 08:16.884
For what?

08:19.599 --> 08:21.362
I don't know.

08:26.072 --> 08:28.836
[announcer on TV] Look out!
And he's gone!

08:28.908 --> 08:31.672
Touchdown!
Michigan goes back up on top!

08:31.744 --> 08:33.506
Touchdown! Yes! Yes!

08:33.613 --> 08:37.140
- And there's a flag down on the play.
- No! No, flag!

08:38.017 --> 08:40.645
Dad, can I talk to you a minute?

08:40.720 --> 08:42.984
- Can't talk.
- It's about sex.

08:45.224 --> 08:48.318
Do I have to break out
the health book again?

08:48.394 --> 08:51.488
- If it's not too much trouble.
- I thought we had this talk.

08:51.564 --> 08:55.728
You did. I'll never forget
the giggling coming from his room.

08:56.269 --> 08:59.636
I couldn't help it.
You should've seen the look on his face.

09:00.239 --> 09:03.333
- I'm not talking to you.
- Ha! You just did.

09:04.877 --> 09:06.606
So, what's on your mind, buddy?

09:07.547 --> 09:10.983
My body feels weird
when I look at girls.

09:11.050 --> 09:16.147
- What's going on with me, Dad?
- Well, it's a rough time, sport.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.349
I remember when I was 13.

09:18.424 --> 09:22.758
Boy, they had ads in the back
of comic books on how to get girls

09:22.828 --> 09:27.162
through hypnosis and X-ray specs.

09:27.233 --> 09:30.396
Total rip-offs. Anyway...

09:30.469 --> 09:33.836
Level 12! I got to level 12!
I've never been to level 12!

09:35.007 --> 09:37.237
What do you think you're doing?

09:37.310 --> 09:40.074
I'm just trying to take
my mind off my problem.

09:41.514 --> 09:43.846
- Outside!
- I'm sorry.

09:43.916 --> 09:45.247
God!

09:46.319 --> 09:49.345
[announcer] Oh, Singletary really
puts a hurt on Temerit.

09:49.422 --> 09:50.980
Knocked his helmet clean off.

09:51.090 --> 09:52.216
Total interference!

09:52.291 --> 09:56.057
[announcer 2] They better make sure his
head's not still in there. [laughing]

09:56.162 --> 09:57.925
Shut up! Not funny.

09:58.030 --> 10:00.999
- [phone ringing]
- Not gonna get that.

10:01.067 --> 10:03.558
[Rory on machine]
You've reached the Hennessys.

10:03.636 --> 10:06.264
If calling Paul, Cate or Rory,
please leave a message.

10:06.339 --> 10:09.502
If calling for Bridget or Kerry,
you have the wrong number.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.133
[man] This is Brenner's Drugs.

10:11.210 --> 10:13.678
I'm calling for the parents
of Bridget Hennessy.

10:13.746 --> 10:16.510
We're detaining her for shoplifting.

10:17.516 --> 10:22.078
[announcer on TV radio indistinct]

10:23.022 --> 10:24.785
- How could you do this?
- Dad, I...

10:24.890 --> 10:27.620
Don't even! Thank you
for calling me and not the cops.

10:27.693 --> 10:29.217
She will never do this again.

10:29.295 --> 10:33.857
At least not here. Everybody on our
wall of shame is permanently banned.

10:33.966 --> 10:37.094
- Dad, I swear...
- Don't talk to me, you are in trouble.

10:37.169 --> 10:40.935
[announcer] That closes the door on the
best half of football I've ever seen!

10:41.007 --> 10:43.134
Big trouble. Come on.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.740
- Bridget!
- I'm not talking about it!

10:49.815 --> 10:52.375
- You are talking about this.
- What is the point?

10:52.485 --> 10:56.751
- You've made up your mind I'm guilty.
- They caught you taking lipstick!

10:56.822 --> 10:59.382
I would never buy lipstick
at a drugstore.

11:00.292 --> 11:02.783
Nobody's accusing you of buying it.

11:02.862 --> 11:05.626
That's why your picture
is up on their wall of shame.

11:05.731 --> 11:07.790
I cannot believe you.
I'm calling Mom.

11:07.867 --> 11:09.334
- And ruin her day?
- Your day?

11:09.402 --> 11:12.735
- You've already done that.
- Dad, if you really want to apologize,

11:12.805 --> 11:15.774
write a column on your paper's
pro-animal-cruelty stance.

11:15.841 --> 11:19.937
All they did was run an ad
for children of all ages.

11:21.180 --> 11:23.273
I knew you wouldn't.
I'm calling Mom.

11:23.349 --> 11:26.785
- Me first.
- Does everyone have a cell phone?

11:26.852 --> 11:29.787
- How much am I paying for these?
- You get the phones free.

11:29.855 --> 11:32.016
I bet you do.
No, you're not calling Mom.

11:32.124 --> 11:36.185
This is a very important day for her.
We're not gonna make it any harder.

11:36.262 --> 11:41.029
- Are you gonna write the article?
- I don't have time to deal with you.

11:41.100 --> 11:42.863
Oh, right, I forgot.

11:42.935 --> 11:46.200
I was caring about animals while
you watched your football game.

11:46.272 --> 11:49.173
I am not watching the game.
It's about Bridget.

11:49.241 --> 11:52.142
Oh, I should have known.
It's always about Bridget.

11:52.211 --> 11:55.112
Bridget's problems
are always more important than mine.

11:55.181 --> 12:00.346
"Oh, my God, Daddy,
my shoe strap broke! What do I do?"

12:01.887 --> 12:04.117
Bridget got busted for shoplifting.

12:05.157 --> 12:07.022
She did?

12:07.493 --> 12:10.985
I did not shoplift. And thanks
for telling everyone my business!

12:11.063 --> 12:13.156
- Who shoplifted?
- I did not!

12:13.232 --> 12:15.666
- I told you to go outside.
- No way.

12:15.735 --> 12:19.831
People are gonna point and say,
"There goes the shoplifter's brother."

12:19.905 --> 12:21.372
You are such a brat.

12:21.440 --> 12:24.204
- Bridget! Bridget, you get back here!
- [phone rings]

12:24.276 --> 12:26.210
- Nobody move!
- Stay inside, got it.

12:26.278 --> 12:29.839
- Nobody move? What's wrong?
- Somebody was offsides. How ya doing?

12:29.949 --> 12:31.610
- Let me talk to her.
- No, no, no.

12:31.684 --> 12:33.413
- No?
- No, offsides again.

12:33.486 --> 12:35.454
The penalties are killing us.

12:35.554 --> 12:38.717
You're gonna hate prison.
Everyone will dress like you.

12:38.791 --> 12:40.281
Stop it!

12:40.359 --> 12:43.260
Paul, what is going on?
Do you need some help?

12:43.329 --> 12:46.389
- Everything is fine.
- Good, because the people I'm with

12:46.465 --> 12:50.026
- want to go watch the rest of the game.
- I'm having fun. You should.

12:50.136 --> 12:53.401
Listen, everything
is under control here. Bye, love you.

12:53.472 --> 12:56.737
- You are so out of control here.
- I'm out of control? You are!

12:56.809 --> 13:00.768
- Are you gonna write the article?
- I can't deal with this now.

13:00.846 --> 13:03.713
- As long as you're not watching...
- Get outside!

13:05.217 --> 13:08.186
That's a lovely outfit, Bridget.
Where did you get it?

13:08.287 --> 13:11.654
- You gave it to me.
- Really? I've never seen it before.

13:11.724 --> 13:13.885
Oh, I knew Mom put your name
on the card!

13:13.959 --> 13:17.122
- I love how I'm on trial here.
- How much time does it take

13:17.196 --> 13:18.424
to step into a store?

13:18.497 --> 13:20.863
Longer, if you actually
pay for the item.

13:22.268 --> 13:23.963
You really think I would shoplift?

13:24.036 --> 13:26.561
Here it is.
Poor little innocent Bridget.

13:26.639 --> 13:29.802
It's bad enough that you stole,
but to stand there and lie.

13:29.875 --> 13:32.343
I thought you had
more character than that.

13:32.411 --> 13:36.745
- Fine! I don't care what you think.
- Come back! We're not done talking!

13:36.816 --> 13:38.078
[door slams]

13:38.150 --> 13:40.118
Go to your room!

13:42.221 --> 13:44.781
- Dad?
- Kerry, I am on my knees.

13:44.857 --> 13:49.226
I really, really can't talk
about circus animals right now.

13:50.296 --> 13:52.787
Do you really
think Bridget would steal?

13:53.833 --> 13:56.802
There's a lot of bad things
that you don't know about.

13:56.869 --> 14:00.327
There's a list as long as your arm.
But stealing, it isn't one of them.

14:00.406 --> 14:03.432
- There's a list as long as my arm?
- At least. But she...

14:03.509 --> 14:05.773
- So what's on the list?
- I'm not telling you!

14:05.845 --> 14:09.747
- Come on, just get me up to my wrist.
- See, that is exactly the problem.

14:09.815 --> 14:12.579
- You don't listen.
- I don't listen?

14:12.685 --> 14:15.654
I mean, God, that thing
about the animals really upset me,

14:15.754 --> 14:18.120
but you ignore me,
'cause I'm the middle child.

14:18.224 --> 14:20.590
- Now, listen. Come on, Bridget...
- Kerry!

14:20.693 --> 14:22.627
I mean... I'm saying Bridget.

14:22.695 --> 14:25.630
With her around here,
it was like a three-ring circus.

14:25.698 --> 14:28.758
- Dad!
- Sorry, no circus, come here. Kerry.

14:28.834 --> 14:32.201
I really do care about what's
important to you. I always have.

14:32.271 --> 14:34.239
- Right.
- No, come here, come here.

14:34.340 --> 14:35.671
Listen, honey.

14:40.045 --> 14:44.573
I know you've always loved animals.
And I adore that about you.

14:44.650 --> 14:48.086
I remember when you were five,
and you had just started to read,

14:48.153 --> 14:52.249
you came to me heartbroken
and crying one day.

14:52.324 --> 14:56.818
You said, "Daddy, I just saw a sign
on the corner and it said 'Last Dog."'

14:56.896 --> 14:58.864
- Do you remember this?
- Kind of.

14:58.964 --> 15:03.025
Anyway, you were sobbing because
you thought there weren't going to be

15:03.102 --> 15:05.593
any more dogs.

15:06.105 --> 15:08.130
And I hugged you and I laughed.

15:08.207 --> 15:12.507
I said, "Honey, it didn't say
'Last Dog.' It said 'Lost Dog."'

15:13.579 --> 15:16.446
And then you started
sobbing all over again.

15:16.515 --> 15:18.346
Because he was lost.

15:19.451 --> 15:22.750
- You found him, right?
- Yes, of course I did.

15:22.821 --> 15:25.585
That's what I said, didn't I?
I said that I found him

15:25.658 --> 15:27.592
and I'm sure he's still on that farm

15:27.660 --> 15:31.892
running and barking and playing
with all the other little doggies.

15:33.399 --> 15:35.299
He's dead, isn't he?

15:37.569 --> 15:40.595
Well, by now.
I mean, it was a long time ago!

15:41.340 --> 15:43.570
Oh, God.

15:46.712 --> 15:48.077
Dad?

15:49.949 --> 15:53.441
How'd you get up there?
Never mind. I don't even want to know.

15:53.886 --> 15:56.446
What is it, Rory?
What could be so important?

15:56.522 --> 15:58.649
Bridget's crying.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.330
[knocking on door]

16:08.600 --> 16:10.465
Beach?

16:13.973 --> 16:15.873
Good idea, I'll start.

16:16.709 --> 16:18.404
Honey, I'm...

16:19.845 --> 16:23.372
I'm sorry I accused you
without listening to your side.

16:23.449 --> 16:28.477
I guess it was the shock of seeing
your picture up on that wall of shame.

16:28.554 --> 16:31.717
- That doesn't make it true.
- I know. So why don't you...

16:31.824 --> 16:33.587
Tell me what really happened.

16:33.692 --> 16:34.989
[sighs]

16:35.060 --> 16:39.827
OK, we stopped in cosmetics because
if we had to do this thing for you,

16:39.898 --> 16:43.732
then we might as well have fun, and
I've never found eye shadow that works

16:43.802 --> 16:46.464
with my combination skin.
"Last all night color"?

16:46.538 --> 16:50.599
- That is a laugh. I get it from Mom.
- Is this leading to the picture?

16:50.676 --> 16:53.008
Courtney was stuffing
a lipstick in her bag.

16:53.078 --> 16:56.570
I was stunned. "What are you doing?"
And she's all, "Everybody does it."

16:56.648 --> 16:59.276
I'm all, "It's stealing."
She's all, "You're a wuss."

16:59.351 --> 17:01.046
- You're all...
- I'm all, "No!"

17:01.120 --> 17:05.250
I put it back myself, then she grabs it
and stuffs it in her fake Fendi baguette

17:05.324 --> 17:08.349
and this clerk shows up
and it turns into this ugly scene.

17:08.426 --> 17:10.987
So you didn't take the lipstick?

17:11.063 --> 17:13.031
No! Dad, it was coral.

17:13.799 --> 17:16.962
I can't wear coral.
Look at me. Hello, I'm a summer.

17:17.036 --> 17:22.133
- That's all I needed to hear.
- Peach. Maybe tangerine too, but...

17:22.207 --> 17:24.539
That's all I needed to hear.

17:24.609 --> 17:28.171
Dad, I know you don't think I care
about what you think of me,

17:28.247 --> 17:32.616
- but I really want you to trust me.
- I do, Bridget, I really do.

17:34.219 --> 17:35.709
- So we're good now?
- No.

17:35.788 --> 17:38.052
No? I said I believe you.

17:38.123 --> 17:41.854
Yeah, but you totally bailed on me.
You dragged me out of that store.

17:41.927 --> 17:45.693
I was humiliated. Like having my picture
on the wall wasn't bad enough.

17:45.764 --> 17:47.493
- Dad?
- What?

17:47.566 --> 17:49.898
It's happening again.

17:49.968 --> 17:52.994
My body's doing strange
and wonderful things.

17:54.840 --> 17:57.206
- I'm so confused.
- OK! Go play your video games.

17:57.276 --> 18:00.404
OK! Thanks, Dad!

18:01.213 --> 18:05.047
- Excuse me, I was here earlier.
- You're the shoplifter's father.

18:05.117 --> 18:07.483
That was a mistake.
She doesn't belong there.

18:07.553 --> 18:10.021
- None of them do.
- My daughter is innocent.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.613
I know. They all are.

18:11.690 --> 18:14.022
Listen, pal, I've had a hard day.

18:14.093 --> 18:18.393
I had to watch the game of the century
on a two-inch television screen.

18:18.464 --> 18:21.490
It was the game of the century?
No, wait, wait.

18:21.567 --> 18:24.866
Did you actually see my girl
take the lipstick?

18:25.904 --> 18:27.872
Yeah, you heard me.
Did you see it?

18:27.973 --> 18:31.465
You can't always catch 'em red-handed.
And she gave me attitude.

18:31.543 --> 18:34.637
Try living with her.
But that doesn't make her a criminal.

18:34.713 --> 18:37.238
- Take down the picture.
- You'd better leave.

18:37.316 --> 18:42.253
I'm not leaving.
You take the picture down or I will.

18:50.229 --> 18:53.289
- Bridgie, look what I have.
- I gotta go.

18:53.365 --> 18:56.892
- Oh, you're the best.
- I got it down before anybody saw it.

18:56.969 --> 18:58.994
Are you saying I don't look good?

18:59.071 --> 19:01.198
Bridget, I am trying my best here.

19:01.273 --> 19:04.208
I went to the pharmacy
and I gave the clerk an earful.

19:04.276 --> 19:07.211
- Please, meet me halfway.
- I'll let you off the hook,

19:07.279 --> 19:08.303
on one condition.

19:08.380 --> 19:11.406
- Heather's having a party this weekend.
- Parents?

19:11.483 --> 19:14.646
No parents, but she's responsible.
Her cousin is a Marine.

19:14.720 --> 19:17.484
He'll be there with his buddies,
so we'll be safe.

19:17.556 --> 19:21.652
I was worried, but as long as there's
gonna be Marines with school girls...

19:21.727 --> 19:23.456
- Have enough booze?
- Thanks!

19:23.529 --> 19:26.089
- That was Daddy's way of saying no way.
- Too late.

19:26.198 --> 19:30.157
Mom, how was class? Stay off the phone.
I'm calling Heather.

19:30.235 --> 19:33.534
- Hi, I had such a great day!
- Did ya?

19:36.708 --> 19:41.441
I was smart and I made new friends,
and what about that game?

19:41.513 --> 19:45.950
I don't usually watch football, and even
I knew I was watching something special.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.384
Yeah. I waited all year for it.

19:48.487 --> 19:51.650
Well, I can see everything's
pretty much the way I left it.

19:52.724 --> 19:56.888
It was a very challenging day, Cate.
I must say, I rose to the challenge.

19:56.962 --> 19:59.624
I should be inducted
into the Father Hall of Fame.

19:59.698 --> 20:02.633
And yet you couldn't
put your dish in the sink.

20:02.701 --> 20:05.261
I'm sorry, honey. I was very busy.

20:05.871 --> 20:10.899
"Did you get my prescription?"
she asked, knowing the answer: "No."

20:10.976 --> 20:15.003
Uh, your prescription.
After all that. I'll go now.

20:15.080 --> 20:17.207
No, no, it's OK, I owe you for today.

20:17.282 --> 20:22.117
Get a head start putting that dish in
the sink and I'll help when I get back.

20:22.187 --> 20:25.350
Cate, you don't happen to know
the score of the game, do you?

20:25.457 --> 20:28.483
Oh, come on, Paul.

20:34.399 --> 20:35.696
Hennessy.

20:40.539 --> 20:41.631
Hennessy?

20:42.441 --> 20:43.703
Yeah.

21:07.766 --> 21:10.257
[man on TV] Stay tuned
for complete game highlights

21:10.335 --> 21:11.859
of today's game of the century.

21:11.937 --> 21:14.963
Dad, this thing
about Bridget and lipstick

21:15.040 --> 21:17.406
started me thinking
about animal testing.

21:17.476 --> 21:20.036
They test cosmetics
on rabbits, you know?

21:20.112 --> 21:23.673
And that started me thinking
about Mr. Wiggles.

21:23.749 --> 21:28.516
I couldn't stand to think if he was
in a cage somewhere with lipstick on.
