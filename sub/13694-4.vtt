How much you're
looking forward
to our weekend away.

05:13.274 --> 05:16.110

about the weekend.

05:16.778 --> 05:17.820
Ah.

05:19.030 --> 05:20.281
Tea?

05:27.455 --> 05:30.333
What do you think of Thailand?

05:30.416 --> 05:33.878
-Thailand?
-New Zealand, maybe?

I told you
to stick to what you know.

05:37.131 --> 05:39.926
-Is that what you did?
-Yep.

05:42.303 --> 05:45.640
Well, I went straight from
school, to uni, to my masters,

05:45.723 --> 05:49.185
so I thought I'd
take a year out now
and catch up on real life.

We're gonna need the table.

I can go away with you.

06:18.006 --> 06:20.216
I thought we agreed.

I thought we agreed
we'd spend some time together.
Alone.

06:25.179 --> 06:28.808
Yes. And I'd like that
very much, really, I would.

06:28.891 --> 06:30.810
But not this weekend.

06:30.893 --> 06:35.356
It's the football match,
you see, the big local derby,

06:35.440 --> 06:38.526
and it means a tremendous
amount to Archie, and I
really ought to be there.

06:38.609 --> 06:41.946
-Archie!
-Mother. Andrew.

06:42.030 --> 06:45.241
Coaching the team is one of
the few perks that I get
as laird.

06:47.368 --> 06:49.412

-Oh, they're Stags, Molly.
Called (WHISPERS) the Stags.
-Oh yes, of course they are!

Winning's the thing.
That's what people want.
They don't care how,

06:55.793 --> 06:58.046
or who gets 'em there,
they simply want to win.

06:58.129 --> 07:00.965
Oh, my word,
spoken like your father.

07:03.051 --> 07:07.847
Now, with some of my lads
playing for the Stags,
and me as coach...

07:07.930 --> 07:10.058
That's always been
Archie's job.

07:10.141 --> 07:12.602
Your lads can't play
for the Stags.
They have to be local.

07:12.685 --> 07:15.355
-They are. Temporarily.
-That's cheating.

07:15.438 --> 07:18.274
You let me coach the team,
Archie, and I'll
bring home the bacon.

-ARCHIE: Can't be done.

-That has nothing
to do with it.

for the job, ask your boys!

do things their way,
we do things our way.

07:27.575 --> 07:30.328
They win. You lose.

to share the duties, you know?
Two heads and all that.

-We're gonna have to have
some house rules here.
-Okay.

appreciate it if you wouldn't
mind keeping your...

I suppose.

I'm here. We've had a row.

I was seeing.
-What person's this?

suitable men, I suppose.

come and watch you play?

to watch the football.

15:38.941 --> 15:42.195
I used to wear my scarf
and my wee woolly hat

15:42.278 --> 15:45.406
and we'd talk the whole way
home about whether or not
it was a free kick,

15:45.490 --> 15:47.909
and what was wrong
with the referee.

football, then?

15:50.620 --> 15:52.747

But it just reminds me
of my dad, so I don't.

You?

16:02.924 --> 16:04.300
Yeah, I do.

watched you play?

didn't like football.
-I don't. See ya.

16:30.410 --> 16:33.579
Me? Uh, out for
a bit of a jog, you know.

16:33.663 --> 16:37.500
And a bit of weight training
thrown in for good measure.

16:37.583 --> 16:41.587
-So, you're jogging
all the way to Glasgow?
-Sorry, Glasgow?

16:44.882 --> 16:50.096
Oh, Glasgow! Well, you know,
bit of jogging,

16:50.179 --> 16:54.100
bit of hitching, you know,
no point in overdoing
it at all, is there, eh?

16:54.183 --> 16:56.144
-Get in.
-Yep.

17:03.484 --> 17:04.484
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

17:05.903 --> 17:08.031
Go on, lad.

17:08.114 --> 17:12.952
-Right, keep going.
-Come on, Angus.

17:13.036 --> 17:16.122
Right, Angus, back down
the hill and straight back up
again, come on.

17:17.957 --> 17:20.126
LEXIE: Don't you think you're
being a bit hard on him?

17:20.209 --> 17:23.838
-What do you suggest?
-A bit of careful handling?

17:23.921 --> 17:25.757
We've got a game to win.

17:25.839 --> 17:27.550
I've got just over a day
and a half

17:27.633 --> 17:29.427
to get this lot
looking something like
a football team.

17:29.510 --> 17:33.431
-Why does it mean so much
to you, anyway?
-Angus?

17:33.514 --> 17:38.227
-Let him go.
-So you're just gonna
give up on him?

17:38.311 --> 17:41.689
I think he's given up
on himself, don't you?
Right, come on.

17:41.773 --> 17:42.774
(WHISTLES)

17:56.328 --> 17:59.874
-Hi, I'm Duncan. I've
got a letter...
-(CAR HORN HONKS)

18:01.750 --> 18:04.253
I've got a letter
from Sadie Carter.

18:06.713 --> 18:09.049
Hi, I'm Duncan.

18:09.133 --> 18:14.972
I've got a meeting tomorrow
with Sadie Carter
from Human Resources.

18:15.056 --> 18:20.144
I was wondering if it was all
right for me to have a look
around to familiarise myself

18:20.228 --> 18:22.313
with the hotel. Establishment.

18:22.397 --> 18:26.609
Facilities.
Tell Sadie, Duncan's here.

18:27.151 --> 18:29.612
Hi. I'm Sadie.

18:32.490 --> 18:34.367
SEAN: So much for feudalism.

18:34.450 --> 18:39.622
And so we come
to the present day.
What, we may ask, has changed?

18:39.706 --> 18:45.878
The feudal lord had power
over every aspect of
his serfs' or tenants' lives.

18:45.962 --> 18:50.008
To what extent does the
modern laird
reproduce this model?

18:50.091 --> 18:52.176
More, perhaps,
than we might imagine.

18:56.764 --> 18:57.807
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

18:57.890 --> 19:00.393
-Jess?
-Won't I do?

19:00.476 --> 19:02.395
I'm sorry, Molly.

19:02.478 --> 19:05.064
Thought I heard you
beavering away.
Everything all right?

19:06.399 --> 19:09.235
Well, no, actually.

19:09.318 --> 19:13.197
Jessica has got herself
a boyfriend who's
a lot older than she is.

19:13.281 --> 19:17.577
Oh, well, there's something
to be said for the older man.

19:17.660 --> 19:23.833
They're more settled and,
well, he can probably afford
to take her to nice places.

19:23.916 --> 19:27.712
Buy her presents. And there's
nothing like experience...

19:28.963 --> 19:30.506
Maybe not.

19:30.590 --> 19:33.885
-It's all my own fault.
-Nonsense.

19:33.968 --> 19:37.430
She hates me. It's obvious.

19:37.513 --> 19:41.809
We're emotional punch bags
when it comes to
our children, Golly.

19:41.893 --> 19:46.147
She'll move on from this older
man, but you'll always be
there for her. She knows that.

19:46.230 --> 19:48.358
Mmm.

19:48.441 --> 19:52.528
-Does she love him?
-She's seeing him.
That's enough, isn't it?

19:52.612 --> 19:56.199
Spending time with somebody is
not the same thing
as loving them.

19:56.282 --> 19:58.368
I suppose not.

19:58.451 --> 20:04.040
People spend time together
for all sorts of reasons.
Sometimes they're just lonely.

20:07.377 --> 20:13.341
Maybe love should be left to
the young. The older one gets,
the less brave one becomes.

20:13.424 --> 20:16.594
-You'll never be old, Molly.
-Oh.

20:17.595 --> 20:20.306
-Andrew.
-Sorry. Our sitting?

20:20.848 --> 20:23.351
Am I late?

20:23.434 --> 20:26.354
Not to worry, I'll drop this
at the house and
see you this evening.

20:26.437 --> 20:27.438
Fine.

20:29.315 --> 20:30.400
Oh, dear.

20:31.943 --> 20:33.111
Are you lonely, Molly?

20:36.447 --> 20:37.490
Me?

20:38.741 --> 20:39.784
No.

20:41.786 --> 20:46.040
Poor Jess. I do know
what it's like to be in love.

20:46.124 --> 20:49.043
-Not the most rational
of feelings.
-No.

20:51.212 --> 20:53.214
When we do fall in love,

20:55.633 --> 20:57.260
it's not always
with the right person.

21:04.600 --> 21:08.104
A sustainable,
social, economic

21:08.187 --> 21:12.358
and environmentally
acceptable land economy:

21:12.442 --> 21:14.152
the bubble theory.

21:23.911 --> 21:25.872
Dr Cook?

21:25.955 --> 21:28.666
You're not a student, are you?
Certainly not one of mine.

21:28.750 --> 21:35.882
No, my name's
Archie MacDonald. I'm a laird.
The laird of Glenbogle.

21:35.965 --> 21:39.260
And I think it's you
who's living in a bubble.

21:40.595 --> 21:42.764
We have amongst us

21:42.847 --> 21:49.270
a social, political
and economic dinosaur.

21:49.354 --> 21:52.482
If you're not interested,
the university authorities
might be.

21:52.565 --> 21:55.026
Then I suggest you
talk to them.

21:55.109 --> 21:59.447
Right now, I have an
important date with a
very special young lady.

21:59.530 --> 22:01.199
Why doesn't that surprise me?

22:03.701 --> 22:05.453
My daughter, Keri.

22:06.120 --> 22:07.288
Hiya.

22:09.040 --> 22:10.583
You're married?

22:12.251 --> 22:13.378
I am.

22:15.213 --> 22:18.883
Come and see me tomorrow.
Call for me
at the faculty office.

22:34.607 --> 22:37.276
Have you got a minute?

22:37.360 --> 22:40.863
-I've got all the time
in the world.
-I need a spot of advice.

22:40.947 --> 22:45.410
-As long as it's not about
dealing with young women.
-It's about Molly, actually.

22:45.493 --> 22:49.872
You're the only person I could
think of to ask. I expect you
know I'm very fond of her.

22:49.956 --> 22:52.000
I think I do.

22:52.083 --> 22:55.086
I want to make her happy, but
I don't seem able
to get through to her.

22:55.169 --> 22:58.131
It's as if she's somehow
avoiding the issue.

22:58.214 --> 23:00.717
I dare say she's happy enough.

23:02.468 --> 23:04.595
You really think so?

23:04.679 --> 23:07.974
Andrew, I think the truth
of the matter is that you want
Molly to make you happy.

23:10.309 --> 23:13.855
I've never met anyone
that put a clock on Molly
and wasn't disappointed.

23:15.148 --> 23:16.983
I dare say
there are some still waiting.

23:20.528 --> 23:22.822
How long?

23:22.905 --> 23:25.575
If it's you she wants, she'll
come round in
her own good time.

23:27.326 --> 23:28.578
But she will not be rushed.

23:49.974 --> 23:50.975

24:08.826 --> 24:10.328
Oh, thank you!

24:18.086 --> 24:21.631
What's that?
Not supper, I hope.

24:23.007 --> 24:25.551
Some soup for Paul's boys.

24:25.635 --> 24:28.471
-Is that the time?
-Mmm-hmm.

24:28.554 --> 24:32.892
Andrew.
I'm simply not ready for him.
He wants to finish my hands.

24:34.435 --> 24:37.021
Oh, I look an absolute fright.

24:38.856 --> 24:41.275
You've been seeing
quite a lot of Andrew.

24:41.359 --> 24:42.610
Can you hand me that flask?

24:42.694 --> 24:45.238
Hmm. He, um...

24:45.321 --> 24:47.782
wants me to
go away with him.

24:47.865 --> 24:49.534
On a dirty weekend?

24:50.284 --> 24:51.911
(CHUCKLES) At my age?

24:53.496 --> 24:54.914
When's age
bothered you, Molly?

24:54.997 --> 24:56.833
Only when it matters!

24:57.750 --> 24:59.752
You like him, don't you?

25:01.462 --> 25:03.172
Molly?

25:03.256 --> 25:06.843
-Yes, of course I like him.
-So go for it.

25:08.219 --> 25:10.763
Well, what would Hector think?

25:10.847 --> 25:12.098
Molly!

25:12.181 --> 25:15.309
And I am rather enjoying
my independence.

25:17.145 --> 25:19.856
-Or loneliness.
-Oh, nonsense!

25:19.939 --> 25:22.191
You've got to take love
where you find it, Molly.

25:23.735 --> 25:26.195
Worry about the
messy bits later, eh?

25:45.381 --> 25:47.425
Come and get it!

25:47.508 --> 25:49.469
-What is it?
-Soup.

25:50.219 --> 25:51.721
Soup?

25:52.180 --> 25:53.806
Yep,

25:53.890 --> 25:56.726
hot chicken soup.

26:01.647 --> 26:03.024
You're spoiling them.

26:03.107 --> 26:04.859
And why not?

26:04.942 --> 26:07.862
You wanna come and join us?
You look like you could
do with some hot soup.

26:07.945 --> 26:08.946
Yeah.

26:12.992 --> 26:14.160
Where do you want me?

26:14.243 --> 26:15.745
Where we left off.

26:15.828 --> 26:18.581
Oh, yes, of course.

26:22.794 --> 26:23.795
Ah...

26:24.337 --> 26:26.130
Where's Lexie?

26:26.214 --> 26:28.383
Oh, she's at the
outdoor centre, running
the soup kitchen.

26:28.466 --> 26:30.677
So it's just you and
me, I'm afraid.

about the football match.
-Hmm.

Um, it'll be over by
mid-afternoon, and...

26:49.362 --> 26:51.614
Do you have any plans for
the rest of the weekend?

26:52.657 --> 26:54.701
I did.

26:54.784 --> 26:57.286
And now you've made
other arrangements?

26:57.370 --> 26:59.163
No.

26:59.247 --> 27:02.542
Good. No sense
in rushing things.

27:06.087 --> 27:09.215
Because only fools rush in.
That's right, isn't it?

27:09.298 --> 27:11.175
I suppose they do.

I thought you were on an
errand for Hermione.

27:40.538 --> 27:45.084
No, it got a bit complicated
so I'll be staying over.
Just for one night, mind.

27:45.168 --> 27:46.627
Yeah, me too.

27:46.711 --> 27:50.048
I haven't booked anywhere yet.
Where are you staying?

27:50.131 --> 27:52.884
The Hilton.
I haven't checked in yet.

27:52.967 --> 27:55.553
They're holding the
room until six o'clock.
What time is it?

27:55.636 --> 27:58.181
Uh... Seven.

27:58.264 --> 28:01.309
Never mind, we'll finish these
and go and find somewhere.

28:04.645 --> 28:06.689
Leave it with me.

28:08.274 --> 28:10.902
-Hi, do you have any rooms?
-Yeah, sure.

28:25.041 --> 28:27.710
Ah, great, thanks a lot.

28:32.256 --> 28:37.553
Problem solved.
We've got to share,
but problem solved.

that this is a gay bar?

28:40.848 --> 28:42.558
Yeah, it's all right, eh?

28:42.642 --> 28:44.394
No, Duncan. Gay.

28:44.477 --> 28:45.687
Yeah, gay.

28:48.773 --> 28:50.149
Gay.

29:16.509 --> 29:20.513
I've just booked us
into a double room.
I'll un-book it.

29:20.596 --> 29:23.224
It's all right,
it's all right.
It's a bed, isn't it?

29:27.478 --> 29:32.108

29:32.191 --> 29:34.360
Lexie, she's fine, yeah.

29:34.444 --> 29:35.695
Great.

29:35.778 --> 29:37.572
I suppose I should
give her a call, actually.

29:37.655 --> 29:41.576
What, the wife? Gonna call
the wife, eh Archie?

29:41.659 --> 29:44.328
Duncan, will you stop
punching me?

do it back to me.

(GRUNTING)

29:58.509 --> 30:01.346
LEXIE: So, why are you
staying down here
and not in the house?

30:01.429 --> 30:03.097
PAUL: First law
of leadership.

30:03.181 --> 30:05.016
Never expect your
men to do anything
you wouldn't do.

30:05.099 --> 30:07.435
Or go anywhere
you wouldn't go.

30:07.518 --> 30:10.772
And do you really think
that we're gonna win?

30:10.855 --> 30:13.358
Why the sudden
interest in the match?

30:13.441 --> 30:15.651
Well, I could ask you
the same thing.

30:15.735 --> 30:19.739
I just want to make
a contribution.
To prove myself, I suppose.

30:22.200 --> 30:25.036
Look, what you're
doing is great.

30:25.119 --> 30:30.041
And it's really good for
Glenbogle and it's good for
the kids that come here.

30:30.124 --> 30:32.001
But?

30:32.085 --> 30:37.090
I think that you should
tread carefully
on Archie's turf.

30:37.173 --> 30:38.925
You think I'm over-stepping
the mark?

30:39.008 --> 30:41.511
No, no, I...

30:41.594 --> 30:45.306
I just think that maybe
you're trying too hard.

30:46.808 --> 30:49.102
You know, you don't need to
prove anything, Paul.

30:50.603 --> 30:52.689
You...you belong here.

30:54.691 --> 30:59.153
And...you need to watch out
for wee Angus.

30:59.237 --> 31:00.571
I thought you were doing that.

31:00.655 --> 31:02.448
He misses his dad.

31:04.325 --> 31:05.993
You're good with him.

31:06.077 --> 31:08.579
At least he listens to you.

31:08.663 --> 31:11.666
I suppose you'll be
having children
of your own soon.

31:11.749 --> 31:13.459
That is a long way away.

31:13.543 --> 31:15.086
Well, you'll make a good mum.

31:21.759 --> 31:25.221
I suppose my childhood
wasn't much to write
home about.

31:26.222 --> 31:29.183
My mum, she just
couldn't cope.

31:29.267 --> 31:31.060
And then when my
dad walked out...

31:31.144 --> 31:33.062
Archie's hardly likely
to do that, is he?

31:33.146 --> 31:35.106
No, no, course not.

31:37.442 --> 31:41.362
But then, I never thought
my dad would either.

31:42.655 --> 31:46.409
And what about Archie?
Does he want kids?

31:46.492 --> 31:51.414
Well, you know, it's
different for him. I mean,
he grew up here.

31:56.002 --> 31:58.087
He's a very lucky man.

32:01.257 --> 32:03.468
Having all this, I mean.

32:03.551 --> 32:06.471
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

32:08.097 --> 32:09.390
I'd better go.

32:14.145 --> 32:15.229
Thanks.

32:24.489 --> 32:25.782
Archie?

32:27.367 --> 32:28.451
Yes.

32:29.535 --> 32:30.828
Are you asleep?

32:32.205 --> 32:33.498
Yes.

32:35.875 --> 32:37.752
Fancy a drink?

32:37.835 --> 32:39.420
Dunc, they'll be shut.

32:39.504 --> 32:41.673
Not necessarily.

32:55.645 --> 32:57.397
Hermione's favourite.

33:00.942 --> 33:02.110
Archie?

33:02.193 --> 33:04.237
Mmm?

33:04.320 --> 33:06.489
I lied about why I'm here.

33:06.572 --> 33:09.117
Okay, so why are you here?

33:10.743 --> 33:13.413
Job interview.

33:13.496 --> 33:15.873
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

33:20.294 --> 33:21.963
(LIGHTING CRASHING)
Dad...

33:24.173 --> 33:25.717
I'm frightened.

33:25.800 --> 33:27.218
Come here.

33:28.469 --> 33:30.471
It's only a wee storm.

33:31.389 --> 33:33.516
Hmm?

33:33.599 --> 33:36.394
I didn't know you were
scared of thunder.

33:36.477 --> 33:38.104
Why should you?

33:38.563 --> 33:39.564
Hmm.

33:44.652 --> 33:47.155
No, I need to better
myself, Archie.

33:47.238 --> 33:49.574
If you're unhappy at
Glenbogle, you should
have just said so.

33:49.657 --> 33:51.034
No, I'm not unhappy.

33:51.117 --> 33:52.869
We could have found
something else for you.

33:52.952 --> 33:57.415
(LAUGHING) Yeah. But I don't
want any favours, Archie.

33:57.498 --> 34:04.005
(SIGHS) No, I need to prove
I can make something of
myself...by myself.

34:04.088 --> 34:07.342
I thought we were family.
You, me, Golly, Lexie.

34:07.425 --> 34:09.802
Yeah, now there's Paul.

34:09.886 --> 34:14.306
Families go their own way,
they fly the nest.

34:14.389 --> 34:17.935
I mean, no offence, Archie,
but it is time to move on.

34:18.018 --> 34:22.315
You've made changes
on the estate.
You've proved yourself.

34:22.398 --> 34:24.108
Because I had to.

34:27.027 --> 34:29.614
Or become a dinosaur.

34:32.241 --> 34:36.411
You see, you're
the laird, Archie.

34:36.496 --> 34:38.956
I mean, you can
do what you like.

34:39.040 --> 34:43.293
And when you decide
to move on, then, well,

34:43.378 --> 34:46.589
you can go out
and find something
for yourself.

34:46.672 --> 34:49.550
That's what I want to do.

34:49.634 --> 34:52.553
Something for me.

34:52.637 --> 34:54.138
Just me.

35:03.231 --> 35:04.649
Go!

35:04.732 --> 35:06.484
MAN: Go.

35:08.653 --> 35:09.987
Move!

35:24.043 --> 35:28.214
You'll be the
laird's wife, Lexie.

35:28.297 --> 35:29.799
I am.

35:29.882 --> 35:31.718
I told him all about you.

35:31.801 --> 35:35.555
He used to play too.
He could have played
for Scotland.

35:35.638 --> 35:36.723
(WHISTLE)

35:36.805 --> 35:39.433
Let's be having you, then!

35:42.812 --> 35:44.355
Breakfast!

35:44.439 --> 35:46.899
-Morning.
-Morning.

35:50.486 --> 35:54.782
No... Oh, no!

35:54.866 --> 35:56.826
Lexie, I don't know why
you're bothering.

35:56.909 --> 35:59.328
I gave him a chance
and he didn't take it.

35:59.412 --> 36:03.291
Well, you have to
spell it out to them.

36:03.373 --> 36:06.252
You know, and even then,
that doesn't always work.

36:06.336 --> 36:09.047
Most men are
emotionally dyslexic.

36:10.882 --> 36:13.217
Oh, definitely not.

36:14.594 --> 36:15.886
I rather like that one.

36:17.388 --> 36:21.059
Do you not think that it makes
you look, um...

36:22.018 --> 36:23.394
Settled?

36:23.478 --> 36:25.396
You've never called
me that before.

36:25.480 --> 36:27.982
Well, I've never had
to dress you for a dirty
weekend before.

36:28.066 --> 36:30.234
I didn't say I was going.

36:31.194 --> 36:34.155
No... Oh, this.

36:35.114 --> 36:36.532
Very nice.

36:36.616 --> 36:38.076
One of my favourites.

36:38.159 --> 36:41.704
Oh, no, look, this'll take far
too long to come off. Sorry.

36:41.788 --> 36:44.749
Lexie, please!

36:44.832 --> 36:49.003
Don't you think I should
wait for him to ask me again?

36:49.087 --> 36:50.630
He already has asked you.

36:50.713 --> 36:52.674
Well, once more would be nice.

36:52.757 --> 36:54.967
He did rather flee last night.

36:55.051 --> 36:57.261
Well, he was being
a gentleman.

36:57.345 --> 36:58.721
Oh, dear.

36:59.722 --> 37:02.266
You need to give him a signal.

37:03.393 --> 37:05.061
What sort of signal?

37:07.188 --> 37:09.190
This sort of signal.

37:09.273 --> 37:12.735
Oh, no, Lexie! No, no.
No, I couldn't possibly.

37:12.819 --> 37:16.406
Oh, well, it is rather nice.

37:16.489 --> 37:17.490
Mmm.

37:18.116 --> 37:19.117
(LAUGHS)

37:22.995 --> 37:25.707
How do you do?
Please sit down.

37:27.625 --> 37:29.127
Okay.

37:29.210 --> 37:31.796
Now, remember, look relaxed
and you'll feel relaxed.

37:31.879 --> 37:35.216
Okay... How?

37:35.299 --> 37:37.719
Uh... Well, like this.

37:41.431 --> 37:45.309
Right, that's easy
enough. Good.

37:47.311 --> 37:51.441
Just relax. How does it feel?

37:52.942 --> 37:56.070
Good, yeah, pretty good.

37:56.154 --> 37:58.865
Okay. Now, don't appear
to be too eager.

37:58.948 --> 38:02.577
Remember, you're interviewing
them as much as they're
interviewing you.

38:02.660 --> 38:07.248
No, no, Archie, it's me
that wants the job.

38:07.331 --> 38:12.879
Yes, I know that, Duncan,
but, well, you can't appear
to be too desperate.

38:13.963 --> 38:15.840
No, I am desperate.

38:15.923 --> 38:20.053
You're a man of the world.
The world is your oyster.

38:22.597 --> 38:27.185
You can have any
job that you want.

38:27.268 --> 38:31.898
Make them think that they
are just one of a long
list of possibilities.

38:36.319 --> 38:38.196
Just relax.

38:39.530 --> 38:40.531
Relax.

38:45.620 --> 38:50.291
Ever since I was
first inducted into the
targeted...

38:50.375 --> 38:52.835
...visitor facility

38:52.919 --> 38:55.922
at Glenbogle Estates Plc,

38:56.005 --> 39:00.301
I realised that the primary
candidate source

39:00.385 --> 39:03.763
would have to extend...

39:03.846 --> 39:08.518
Beyond the local
catchment area if
business was to expand.

39:08.601 --> 39:12.980
This required a studied
and concise...

39:13.064 --> 39:14.357
...approach

39:14.440 --> 39:18.027
to time-space management,

39:18.111 --> 39:21.197
with an ability to put in
place an alternative,

39:21.280 --> 39:26.077
although by no means
less effective,

39:26.160 --> 39:28.996
series of measures,

39:29.080 --> 39:33.543
if the need arose through,
for example...

39:33.626 --> 39:35.420
...human deviation

39:35.503 --> 39:39.590
from the already existing...
I'm sorry.

39:40.425 --> 39:42.093
Is this you, Duncan?

39:42.176 --> 39:44.178
I'm sorry if I've wasted
your time.

39:45.972 --> 39:46.973
Aye.

39:56.441 --> 39:59.318
You're warning me
off the daughter of
one of your retainers?

39:59.402 --> 40:00.528
He's a friend.

40:00.611 --> 40:01.738
But on the payroll.

40:01.821 --> 40:02.864
He works with me.

40:02.947 --> 40:04.073
For you.

40:04.157 --> 40:06.409
That's hardly the point.

40:06.492 --> 40:09.662
The point being that, but for
an accident of birth the roles
might have been reversed.

40:09.746 --> 40:11.497
I mean, you own the
ground he walks on.

40:11.581 --> 40:15.877
Not only was Jessica one of
your students, but you're
a married man.

40:15.960 --> 40:18.463
I do own 40,000 acres, but
with that comes a burden

40:18.546 --> 40:20.590
of responsibility that I
take very seriously.

40:20.673 --> 40:24.218
The defence of the
benevolent dictator.

40:24.302 --> 40:28.139
Come on, this is the 21st
century, wake up and
smell the coffee.

40:28.222 --> 40:30.391
We have opened up the estate.

40:30.475 --> 40:35.563
We run outward-bound schemes
for city children. We brought
wolves back to the Highlands.

40:35.646 --> 40:38.316
We support the local
community. There must be
something I'm doing right.

40:38.399 --> 40:42.737
Aye, but you, one man, owns a
great swathe of this country.

40:42.820 --> 40:44.530
Yes...

40:44.614 --> 40:46.824
And all the good works, the
access, whatever you
want to call it...

40:46.908 --> 40:48.868
Is all in your gift as laird.

40:48.951 --> 40:51.371
Well, it may seem archaic to
you, but we are modernising.

40:51.454 --> 40:53.581
For laird, read
managing director.

40:53.664 --> 40:57.543
I run a family business
that benefits a lot of people.

40:57.627 --> 41:00.380
I suppose you do.

41:00.463 --> 41:02.757
Would you read
my lecture notes?

41:02.840 --> 41:04.092
Why?

41:04.175 --> 41:07.261
I might be open to persuasion.

41:07.345 --> 41:12.975
And as for being married,
it's more of a technicality.
I'm about to be divorced.

41:13.935 --> 41:17.480
I'm sorry.

41:17.563 --> 41:22.110
And you can tell
Jessica's father that
it's over between us.

41:24.487 --> 41:28.408
She dumped me.

41:28.491 --> 41:36.499
He asked me to move in with
him. I told him I wasn't ready
for that sort of commitment.

41:36.582 --> 41:39.961
I should have left things as
they were, I suppose.

41:40.044 --> 41:42.088
But you can't go
back, can you?

41:43.214 --> 41:46.217
Why didn't you tell me?

41:46.300 --> 41:50.430
Because you were too
bothered with your own
feelings to listen.

41:51.764 --> 41:53.641
I'm sorry, lass.

41:55.476 --> 41:57.061
I do miss her.

41:58.521 --> 42:01.315
I loved him, Dad.

42:03.109 --> 42:04.819
I really loved him.

42:04.902 --> 42:09.574
Ah, darling girl,
I know, I know, I know.

42:11.909 --> 42:16.080
We don't always love
the right person, do we?

42:22.420 --> 42:29.302
And yet, there's something
liberating about losing
whatever it is you hold dear.

42:29.385 --> 42:31.137
You should try it some time.

42:33.556 --> 42:35.933
Don't forget my lecture notes.

42:36.934 --> 42:38.811
They won't bite.

43:04.128 --> 43:05.963
Hi.

43:06.047 --> 43:07.298
Miss me?

43:08.257 --> 43:09.592
Not a bit.

43:17.767 --> 43:19.644
How did it go?

43:22.271 --> 43:26.609
Tell me, Lex, do
you think it's wrong

43:26.693 --> 43:31.197
for one man to own
an estate this size?

43:31.280 --> 43:34.242
Hm...depends what
he does with it.

43:34.325 --> 43:37.245
Am I a dinosaur...

43:37.328 --> 43:39.997
Or a dictator?

43:43.793 --> 43:45.712
Are you all right?

43:45.795 --> 43:49.132
Yeah, fine. We'll talk
about it in the morning.

43:49.215 --> 43:50.299
Bed?

43:59.851 --> 44:02.103
You'll never guess
who I slept with last night.

44:02.186 --> 44:03.312
Archie!

44:24.167 --> 44:26.169
You had your chance.

44:26.252 --> 44:28.004
I felt others deserved
it more.

44:35.636 --> 44:37.013
What's wrong?

44:37.096 --> 44:38.806
He's on the bench.

44:39.932 --> 44:42.018
(SARCASTICALLY) Oh, great!

44:53.071 --> 44:56.491
-Right, lads, let's go.
-Come on, Stags!

44:56.574 --> 45:01.371
-Come on the Stags!
-Come on the Stags!

45:03.539 --> 45:05.875
-(CROWD CHEERING)
-PAUL: Concentrate, lads.

45:08.086 --> 45:09.879
Molly!

45:09.962 --> 45:11.631
You look wonderful.

45:11.714 --> 45:15.093
You don't think it's too much?
For a football match, I mean.

45:15.176 --> 45:17.595
No, of course not.

45:17.679 --> 45:19.180
I have got a case in the car.

45:19.263 --> 45:20.473
You do?

45:20.556 --> 45:23.434
I could change into
something more...

45:23.518 --> 45:26.354
Or I could wait until we
get to the hotel.

45:26.437 --> 45:28.523
You look absolutely perfect.

45:28.606 --> 45:33.111
Come and sit down.
Here we are.

45:33.194 --> 45:38.366
I don't know much
about Andrew, but he does make
Mother happy, doesn't he?

45:39.784 --> 45:41.327
Come on, boys!

45:41.994 --> 45:43.037
That's it!

45:43.121 --> 45:44.122
PAUL: Easy goal, come on.

45:45.665 --> 45:47.709
-Go on!
-Come on!

45:48.918 --> 45:51.796
Come on, lads!
Hold it there!

45:51.879 --> 45:56.134
Come on the Stags!
Keep it tight. Go on.

45:57.468 --> 45:58.678
Yes, yes! Come on!

46:16.738 --> 46:19.615
Where do you think
I should have my desk?

46:23.369 --> 46:25.997
This came this morning.

46:27.498 --> 46:29.334
Aren't you going to open it?

46:29.917 --> 46:31.252
I can't.

46:31.336 --> 46:33.087
Duncan!

46:33.171 --> 46:34.464
You read it.

46:48.227 --> 46:49.395
What do they say?

46:51.731 --> 46:56.235
"Dear Duncan,"
blah, blah, blah,

46:56.319 --> 47:02.658
"We are sorry to inform you
that your application for the
position of," blah, blah,

47:03.701 --> 47:07.121
"has been unsuccessful."

47:07.205 --> 47:10.375
But they almost offered me
the job there and then.

47:10.458 --> 47:12.085
"Yours," etc.

47:16.422 --> 47:17.715
I'm sorry, Duncan.

47:20.593 --> 47:22.637
Maybe I was aiming too high.

47:25.598 --> 47:28.017
Look on the bright side.

47:28.101 --> 47:31.104
I'm trying, Hermione.
I really am.

47:31.187 --> 47:34.565
You won't be going away
from me, will you?

47:35.358 --> 47:37.068
No...

47:37.777 --> 47:39.404
No...

47:39.487 --> 47:40.905
I don't
suppose I will.

47:44.200 --> 47:45.201
(CROWD CHEERING)

47:48.955 --> 47:50.915
How much longer have we got?

47:50.998 --> 47:52.208
Two minutes.

47:52.291 --> 47:54.085
Come on the Stags!

47:59.507 --> 48:02.385
Nil-nil's not too
bad, considering.

48:02.468 --> 48:05.221
Look, if it ends up a draw,
they keep the antlers
for another year.

48:09.517 --> 48:12.603
-(WHISTLE BLOWING)
-Aw, come on! Penalty!

48:14.480 --> 48:15.940
-(WHISTLE BLOWING)
-REFEREE: Penalty!

48:16.024 --> 48:17.567
Yes!

48:17.650 --> 48:18.901
REFEREE: Can we have
the trainer over, please?

48:22.447 --> 48:24.198
Come on. Now's your chance.

48:24.282 --> 48:25.742
I'm not going on.

48:25.825 --> 48:27.368
LEXIE: We had a deal.

48:27.452 --> 48:30.246
ANGUS: I've changed my mind.

48:30.329 --> 48:34.917
You'll be letting your
whole team down.
You'll be letting me down.

48:35.001 --> 48:38.880
And worst of all, you'll be
letting yourself down.
Is that what you want?

48:38.963 --> 48:41.966
-I don't care.
-Yeah, well, I do!

48:42.050 --> 48:43.426
You're going on whether
you like it or not.

48:43.509 --> 48:45.303
You can't make me.
You're not my mum.

48:46.220 --> 48:48.014
Well, fine.

48:48.097 --> 48:50.224
You talk to him, then.

48:51.434 --> 48:52.769
Come here.

48:55.146 --> 48:58.358
ARCHIE: Come on Stags,
this is it!

48:58.441 --> 49:01.861
-What's it to be?
-I'm not going on.

49:01.944 --> 49:08.117
You're 15. You've got
your whole life ahead of you.

49:08.201 --> 49:11.662
I mean, I'd give it a go
if I had the chance,
but I gave up.

49:11.746 --> 49:15.833
I knew it. Hamish McKinnon.

49:15.917 --> 49:17.043
Is that what you want?

49:17.126 --> 49:18.211
No.

49:18.294 --> 49:19.962
He was one of my
heroes, Lexie.

49:20.046 --> 49:25.426
What might have been
counts for nothing.
It's just a dream.

49:26.803 --> 49:28.680
Do you still dream, laddie?

49:30.848 --> 49:33.893
Of scoring a hat-trick
for Scotland, eh?

49:33.976 --> 49:36.270
Of course you do.

49:38.356 --> 49:40.441
(CROWD CLAPPING AND CHEERING)

49:44.404 --> 49:45.780
All right. On you go.

49:46.948 --> 49:48.658
Let me take the penalty.

49:55.456 --> 49:59.293
Look, what's more important,
winning the game or
helping the boy?

50:01.421 --> 50:03.840
Okay, you take it.

50:05.174 --> 50:07.260
Come on, Angus.

50:09.929 --> 50:10.930
MAN: Come on, Angus!

50:15.143 --> 50:17.270
You could have
been the best, man.

50:17.353 --> 50:20.064
What happened?

50:20.148 --> 50:24.110
We played Palermo
in the European Cup
Winners Cup.

50:24.193 --> 50:27.280
The Dunfermline disaster.
I was there.

50:27.363 --> 50:31.200
Got a last minute penalty.
It could have been
the winning goal.

50:31.284 --> 50:32.827
But you missed it.

50:33.703 --> 50:35.997
We lost in extra time.

50:38.666 --> 50:40.460
Things were never the same
after that.

50:41.961 --> 50:43.796
And all this time I thought
you were...

50:44.630 --> 50:46.090
Dead?

50:46.966 --> 50:48.885
Sorry.

50:53.598 --> 50:54.807
(WHISTLE)

50:58.853 --> 51:00.688
Oh!

51:10.490 --> 51:11.491
Yes, yes, yes!

Angus, Angus!

51:39.644 --> 51:42.397
Yours, I think.

Two heads, Archie.

51:53.324 --> 51:57.453
(CHUCKLING) Yes, in fact,
Lexie and I, we were having a
little bit of a chat and...

51:57.537 --> 52:00.623
Well, I think we should share
more of the workload

52:00.707 --> 52:03.793
and the responsibilities
of running the estate.

52:05.211 --> 52:06.462
Are you sure about this?

52:06.546 --> 52:09.841
Yeah. It's time to wake up
and smell the coffee.

52:15.179 --> 52:17.348
Come on. Team photo.

52:19.559 --> 52:20.685
What's wrong?

52:20.768 --> 52:23.771
Where did Hamish go?
He didn't see me score.

52:23.855 --> 52:28.109
Oh, he did, son.
I'm sure he did.

52:30.069 --> 52:31.571
Come on, Angus.

52:32.655 --> 52:34.198
TEAMMATE: Come on, Angus.

52:34.282 --> 52:37.702
The photographer wants a photo
of the laird with the team.

52:37.785 --> 52:39.287
Yes, of course.

52:48.838 --> 52:50.715
Paul, you should be
in this too. Come on.

52:50.798 --> 52:52.008
Go on, Paul.

52:52.884 --> 52:53.885
PLAYER: Aye, Paul.
