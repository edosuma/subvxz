WEBVTT

00:01.043 --> 00:04.462
Nachos and guacamole
like chipotle

00:04.588 --> 00:06.881
But it is real

00:09.051 --> 00:10.343
Can I help you?

00:10.761 --> 00:12.011
Yeah. How much you want for this junk?

00:12.179 --> 00:14.889
How 'bout a quabillion jillion trillion dollars?

00:14.973 --> 00:17.183
This isn't a yard sale, you bitch ass.

00:17.476 --> 00:19.352
-Bitch ass?
-Yeah, I said bitch ass. Put it down.

00:19.436 --> 00:20.645
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:20.729 --> 00:22.313
-Hey, man.
-Easy, man. Hands off.

00:22.439 --> 00:24.107
-Put down my record, bro.
-Wey-oh.

00:24.942 --> 00:26.526
Put down my record!

00:27.361 --> 00:28.361
Hey, guys!

00:29.405 --> 00:32.115
Something's going down in the front yard.
Check it out!

00:34.034 --> 00:35.034
There I go.

00:35.828 --> 00:36.869
-Hey, Karl!
-Bring the tone down.

00:36.954 --> 00:38.037
-Back it off.
-Keep your hands off me.

00:38.122 --> 00:39.163
What the hell are you doing?

00:39.748 --> 00:41.958
-Dean, we'll handle this scandal.
-All right, man. See that you do.

00:43.210 --> 00:45.294
Thank you so much. You saved me.
Thank you.

00:45.379 --> 00:48.464
Karl, bud, it's too early for this.
What's all this stuff, man?

00:48.716 --> 00:51.050
Oh, dude, this stuff is my Mexican stuff.

00:51.135 --> 00:53.094
-I've been getting hella into Mexico lately.
-Oh. Ooh.

00:53.220 --> 00:55.096
-Oh, yeah?
-I actually need to go back down there

00:55.180 --> 00:57.557
right now to help
some coyotes do a border run.

00:57.641 --> 01:01.060
So if you guys don't mind, I'd...
I'd love to leave this stuff inside your house.

01:01.145 --> 01:02.729
- Okay. All right.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.397
You got one trip.

01:04.898 --> 01:07.817
Anything you can get in
the house in one trip can stay.

01:08.152 --> 01:10.653
All this other shite got to go.

01:10.946 --> 01:13.322
That's cool.
I already know what I'm gonna do.

01:16.952 --> 01:18.077
Come on. Get it, boy.

01:18.162 --> 01:20.371
Get it, boy. Live there. You got this.

01:20.706 --> 01:23.166
-Finish line's right there.
-Yeah! Whoo!

01:23.250 --> 01:24.250
-What do you need?
-I need water.

01:24.334 --> 01:26.335
No, no, no. No, we said no water.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.087
Right there, across the plank.
You got this. You got this.

01:28.172 --> 01:29.714
--You got this!

01:29.798 --> 01:32.842
Ahhh! No!

01:33.010 --> 01:34.594
--Yay!

01:35.512 --> 01:38.055
Oh, ho, ho, ho. Blanket.

01:38.265 --> 01:41.100
-Blanket on the ground.
-That's my favorite blanket.

01:41.310 --> 01:43.853
-That's all right.
-It belongs to the outside now, bitch.

01:48.150 --> 01:49.150
I'm fresh

01:50.736 --> 01:52.779
You gotta, you gotta
You gotta, gotta

01:52.863 --> 01:54.155
Gotta be fresh

01:56.158 --> 01:59.952
--Whoa, is that a full body shot of Olmec?

02:00.037 --> 02:01.287
I've never seen his lower half.

02:01.371 --> 02:03.331
Is this a Legends of the Hidden Temple
tell-all?

02:03.415 --> 02:04.665
Dude, probably.

02:04.958 --> 02:08.169
Everything cool comes from Mexico.
You know, tacos and...

02:08.587 --> 02:10.546
-Where's your blanket though?
-Oh, hey, uh...

02:10.631 --> 02:13.216
These right here in the bag,
they're in a bag for a reason.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.843
They are muy caliente...
Burning your skin off.

02:16.011 --> 02:18.262
-Don't let 'em touch you. All right?
-All right.

02:18.555 --> 02:22.141
-Sweet.
-Awesome. This right here is very important.

02:22.226 --> 02:23.893
I need to ask a favor of you.

02:24.144 --> 02:27.855
I have a business associate stopping by
tomorrow to pick that up.

02:27.940 --> 02:29.273
Don't open it. It says it right there.

02:29.399 --> 02:32.068
-It does. Right on the front.
-Yeah, I read that, too, but I was like,

02:32.402 --> 02:33.528
"It's like a suggestion."

02:33.612 --> 02:37.281
But I really want to know, "What's in the box?

02:37.950 --> 02:39.742
"What's in the box?"

02:41.578 --> 02:44.705
Like from that scary movie, Se7en?
With Brad Pitt?

02:44.790 --> 02:46.749
I'm sorry. I haven't seen movies.

02:47.084 --> 02:49.544
But I know who Brad Pitt is.
I see his face on the magazine blankets

02:49.628 --> 02:50.628
that keep me warm at night.

02:50.712 --> 02:52.421
-Magazine blankets.
-Okay, but, like,

02:52.673 --> 02:55.258
what is "in the box" actually, though?

02:55.384 --> 02:56.384
We don't want to know
what's in the box, okay?

02:56.468 --> 02:59.011
Don't tell us, 'cause we're not
some shady FedEx Kinko's

02:59.096 --> 03:00.680
with package pickup availability, okay?

03:00.764 --> 03:04.892
Okay, well I have 2,000 reasons
that says otherwise.

03:04.977 --> 03:07.603
-These are all dollars.
-Oh. Well, hell yeah.

03:07.688 --> 03:09.355
-We'll do it. Come on. Give me the money.
-Oh, my gosh.

03:09.606 --> 03:12.400
I'll give you one G now
and then another G upon completion, okay?

03:12.484 --> 03:15.027
I love that you're giving us
money, but it's "T"s.

03:15.112 --> 03:16.737
-It's not "G"s.
-Hmm?

03:16.989 --> 03:19.949
It's thousands. Not "grousands."

03:20.742 --> 03:23.286
-Hmm?
-Oh, wow.

03:23.662 --> 03:26.956
It's always been "G"s in my book.
Let me change that.

03:28.083 --> 03:29.458
I'm glad I'm here
to teach you something.

03:30.377 --> 03:32.086
You guys, I think we should open the box.

03:32.170 --> 03:33.629
I just want to know what we're dealing with.

03:33.797 --> 03:35.923
No, you can't open the box, Ders.

03:36.008 --> 03:37.383
It's definitely drugs, all right?

03:37.467 --> 03:39.510
As soon as you open the box,
you're a drug dealer.

03:39.595 --> 03:40.761
You leave the box closed,

03:40.846 --> 03:44.223
you're just a friendly neighborhood, like,
box dealer. Like a UPS man or something.

03:44.474 --> 03:47.852
I'm gonna go talk to Alice, get tomorrow off
because I feel like I've been stacking

03:47.936 --> 03:50.646
a lot of cool points as of late,
so I'm gonna go cash those in.

03:50.939 --> 03:52.106
-Good call.
-Cool points?

03:53.734 --> 03:55.401
-Yeah.
-Okay. Well, I've never heard of it,

03:55.485 --> 03:57.820
and it sounds really fake, like it doesn't exist.

03:58.113 --> 04:01.240
Mmm, very, very, very real.
It's, like, a real thing.

04:01.325 --> 04:03.075
It's like when you do something cool,
you get a cool point.

04:03.160 --> 04:05.244
Maybe you poop your pants.
Cool points depleted.

04:05.329 --> 04:07.038
Maybe you piss yourself,
or maybe you puke on your shirt...

04:07.164 --> 04:09.832
But if, sometimes
if you puke a distance, then...

04:09.958 --> 04:13.002
Then perhaps you get
a cool point for projectile.

04:13.545 --> 04:16.255
That's cool.
I'm at 68 right now and I'm about to get to 69,

04:16.340 --> 04:19.717
which, in itself, you get extra cool points,
for being close to 69,

04:19.801 --> 04:21.260
because that's such a cool number.

04:21.678 --> 04:25.097
You actually would get a more... Okay.

04:25.182 --> 04:28.684
I'm gonna... I'm gonna go talk to Alice then.
Dicks.

04:28.977 --> 04:30.019
Thank you.

04:30.562 --> 04:31.896
A day off?

04:33.190 --> 04:36.275
All right, everyone.
In the conference room, now.

04:36.735 --> 04:38.653
-Alice, I got your coffee.
-Mmm-hmm.

04:42.824 --> 04:45.868
-Jillian, this is ice cold.
-Like your heart.

04:46.119 --> 04:48.496
She is freaking Jeremy-Pived.

04:48.997 --> 04:50.790
I wonder if, like, my cool points depleted

04:50.874 --> 04:52.792
when I got all that hot sauce
in my eyes last week

04:52.876 --> 04:55.252
from the burrito, and she must have seen it.

04:57.047 --> 04:58.506
Is there something wrong with you people?

04:59.299 --> 05:00.383
Because every day this week,

05:00.509 --> 05:04.220
someone has come to me bitching
and moaning about a new problem.

05:04.680 --> 05:10.685
Well, it ends now, because I don't give
a fuck about your problems.

05:10.978 --> 05:14.230
Hear that, Tez?
No more coming to my office whining,

05:14.314 --> 05:17.441
"Where my leads at? I don't got no lizz-eads."

05:17.734 --> 05:18.734
I don't sound like that.

05:19.069 --> 05:21.612
And, Bill? Stop coming to me for advice.

05:21.947 --> 05:24.365
"Why won't girls date me?"

05:25.075 --> 05:28.077
Maybe 'cause you're broke
'cause you suck at your job.

05:28.578 --> 05:31.080
Ow. Burn notice received.

05:31.164 --> 05:34.083
You know, Bill,
a wig could really help with your confidence.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.377
And, Gary, stop staring at Jillian.

05:38.755 --> 05:40.589
Can't tell if this guy wants to fuck
or kill me.

05:40.674 --> 05:46.971
Oh, and now you three want a day off
for no reason at all.

05:47.347 --> 05:50.850
-Really, that... That'd be great.
-100% no.

05:51.268 --> 05:54.270
If everyone else is here,
so are you three idiots.

05:54.896 --> 05:58.733
-And, hey. Consider this your lunch break.
-What?

05:58.984 --> 05:59.984
Jillian.

06:00.318 --> 06:04.113
-You just ate lunch.
-Gah, this job is a jizz-oke.

06:04.656 --> 06:05.948
Oh, yeah, I do sound like that.

06:06.116 --> 06:08.117
What are we gonna do, man?
We still need tomorrow off.

06:08.452 --> 06:11.704
If no one comes in the office,
the heat'll be off us.

06:11.788 --> 06:12.788
What about a ditch day?

06:13.331 --> 06:14.582
That's perfect. Oh, my God.

06:14.708 --> 06:17.043
Hey, wait. Hang on. Shh. Everyone shut up.

06:17.127 --> 06:18.419
-Sit down.
-Shut up and sit down.

06:18.587 --> 06:19.962
- Shut up and sit down.
- Shut up.

06:20.047 --> 06:21.380
-Sit down, shut up.
-Okay, now you shut up.

06:21.465 --> 06:22.631
Okay, here's the deal, guys.

06:23.133 --> 06:26.093
I know tensions are running high
working here. It's tough, right?

06:26.178 --> 06:27.219
I hate it. I hate it.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.722
Instead of coming here
tomorrow and working,

06:29.806 --> 06:32.558
why don't you guys come
to our place for a ditch day?

06:32.642 --> 06:33.893
-Oh, my God. That sounds fun.
-Uh, nah, nah.

06:33.977 --> 06:34.977
-Just like in high school.
-Nah, nah, nah.

06:35.062 --> 06:37.563
We ain't going to your nasty-ass frat house,

06:38.106 --> 06:41.484
bath soap all covered
in pubes and dookie streaks.

06:41.568 --> 06:44.528
Nope, there is no dookie
on the soap anymore.

06:44.654 --> 06:46.072
-Not anymore.
-We switched to body wash.

06:46.239 --> 06:47.490
-So we solved that problem.
-Yup.

06:47.574 --> 06:48.616
So I'll see you guys there?

06:50.452 --> 06:53.245
-Also, there's gonna be alcohol, snacks, food.
-Tons of booze.

06:53.330 --> 06:57.249
-Yeah, so...
-Okay, so ditch day is a s'go.

06:57.501 --> 07:01.003
You know what, dude? I think I figured it out,
why my cool points are dipping.

07:01.088 --> 07:03.089
-What?
-I need, like, a new hip name.

07:03.173 --> 07:06.008
Yeah, it's pretty bad.
I been meaning to tell you about it.

07:06.218 --> 07:08.094
-Nails DeChamp.
-Okay, right this way.

07:08.178 --> 07:09.178
Wow. That's good, right?

07:09.262 --> 07:11.889
The pianist, you can just get set up in there.
Okay?

07:11.973 --> 07:14.141
Um, and if you don't mind,
let's keep it classy,

07:14.267 --> 07:17.186
but also a little nasty,
just like my main man, Jamie Foxx.

07:17.312 --> 07:19.105
In fact, I got a little bracelet for you here.

07:19.189 --> 07:22.441
"WWJFP." What would Jamie Foxx play?
All right?

07:22.526 --> 07:24.985
Okay. I'm gonna need that back though.
Thank you.

07:25.070 --> 07:27.071
Excuse me, honey,
where do you keep your plates?

07:27.906 --> 07:30.407
Honey? I'm not your honey.
I'm your boss, okay?

07:30.617 --> 07:32.785
The kitchen is that way. Please, get in there.

07:33.537 --> 07:36.789
Do not use the Wendy's napkins.
Use the Starbucks napkins.

07:38.500 --> 07:41.127
Yo, hey, bro, what... What's up, man? Um...

07:41.211 --> 07:43.796
So, what? Are these volunteers, or you...
You hired people?

07:43.964 --> 07:45.381
Yes, Blake. I had to hire people.

07:45.507 --> 07:47.716
Two people, okay?
I'm trying to class it up here.

07:47.801 --> 07:50.511
It's only 300 bucks out of
the thousand that Karl gave us.

07:50.679 --> 07:51.887
I mean, you could have asked us.

07:51.972 --> 07:55.850
-You spend money to make money.
-Exactly. Right? And I spent $700 more

07:55.934 --> 07:58.727
on finger foods, this rug,
thank you for not stepping on it,

07:58.812 --> 08:00.896
and the Chiavari chairs, which look...

08:01.565 --> 08:03.232
-They look so good.
-These look great.

08:03.525 --> 08:06.110
Plus we got another thousand coming
when we get rid of the drug box, right?

08:06.194 --> 08:07.653
-One more T, baby.
-Right. Right.

08:07.737 --> 08:08.821
- So we're fine.

08:08.905 --> 08:10.823
-All right. Yeah.
-Oh, I got it. Uh-oh, party time.

08:10.907 --> 08:12.241
-Skip over the rug.
-Look good. Look good.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.160
-What up.
-Hey.

08:14.244 --> 08:20.624
Hey. Hey. It's me, Nails DeChamp,
your party guide for ditch day.

08:20.959 --> 08:22.334
Welcome to the main event.

08:22.419 --> 08:25.171
Give me some food.
I skipped dinner last night for this.

08:25.255 --> 08:26.839
We got plenty of food.
Let me get my waitress.

08:26.923 --> 08:28.340
Paula, eggs!

08:28.758 --> 08:29.925
Where this drank at?

08:30.010 --> 08:31.677
--Yeah, yeah, I understand that,

08:31.761 --> 08:33.637
but it makes my feet swell up like balloons.

08:33.722 --> 08:35.681
Jillian, breakfast biscuit and black coffee.

08:37.309 --> 08:39.185
- Jillian?

08:42.856 --> 08:44.273
Oh, what the fuck?

08:47.777 --> 08:49.612
We're like
fresh, fresh, fresh

08:52.157 --> 08:54.241
Ah, no. I'm full. Thank you.

08:55.452 --> 08:58.871
Hey, what'd you think of the bathroom?
How about that two-ply Charmin?

08:58.955 --> 09:00.289
You know what? It was all right.

09:00.415 --> 09:02.208
Them booty wipes was a nice touch.

09:02.292 --> 09:05.794
- It stings now, but it's a good sting.
- Fantastic.

09:06.004 --> 09:09.715
Guys, if we could put our phones away,
that'd be great. All right?

09:09.799 --> 09:11.884
Come on.
We're staring at these things all day.

09:11.968 --> 09:13.302
Do we even know each other anymore?

09:13.553 --> 09:17.556
For instance, Ghostman.
What, uh, like, what's even your real name?

09:18.016 --> 09:20.684
-My name's Gary Golstman.
-Oh.

09:21.686 --> 09:24.980
Oh, that... I just always thought Alice
was calling you that because...

09:25.232 --> 09:26.565
-Nothing.
-Yo, Blake.

09:26.816 --> 09:28.442
Watch me stack mad cool points

09:28.526 --> 09:31.070
-with this B-boy flavor.
-Oh, all right.

09:31.363 --> 09:32.780
-Ayo!
-Ladies and gentlemen.

09:32.864 --> 09:37.284
-Who's ready to b-b-b-b-break dance!
-Me.

09:37.744 --> 09:38.786
-Get 'em, Nails.
-Here, Steven.

09:39.746 --> 09:43.249
Oh, daddy's a dancer

09:45.585 --> 09:48.170
That's not break dancing. This is.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.089
Oh!

09:51.466 --> 09:54.301
- Oh, is that... Ha, ha, ha!
- Adam.

09:54.386 --> 09:56.512
I'll frickin' break-dance.
I'll frickin' break-dance!

09:56.596 --> 09:57.763
-Adam.
-Oh!

09:57.847 --> 09:59.765
-I'll break-dance!
-It's a rental.

10:00.016 --> 10:01.642
It's a rental. It's a rental.

10:02.102 --> 10:05.437
- Someone needs a chill pill.

10:06.731 --> 10:10.693
Hey, you know what?
I told y'all this party was gonna eat my booty.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.611
Let's get out of here.
I haven't had a sale in three weeks.

10:12.696 --> 10:15.447
Whoa. Hang on. Everyone, sit down.
Sit down and shut up.

10:15.532 --> 10:17.241
-You can't ditch ditch day.
-That's right.

10:18.368 --> 10:22.746
Everybody, sit down. Okay?
Sit down, Montizzle.

10:22.831 --> 10:25.416
Listen, I've been reading a lot
about the Mayans, okay?

10:25.500 --> 10:28.502
And when they stressed out
about pesos, they didn't just,

10:28.878 --> 10:32.214
you know, run back to work.
They sipped the worm water.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.551
You guys want me to chug that? 'Cause I will.

10:35.635 --> 10:38.929
-Someone dare me to chug that.
-All right. Come on, everybody, shots!

10:39.139 --> 10:43.058
In honor of Olmec,
the Mayan god of chillaxing.

10:46.229 --> 10:51.608
-I will get with Waymond.
-Waymond wouldn't be with you.

10:51.985 --> 10:57.239
Everybody here can suck my big johnson!

10:59.242 --> 11:01.618
--TelAmeriCorp, please hold.

11:02.454 --> 11:04.121
Well, then please hold a third time.

11:04.414 --> 11:05.789
TelAmeriCorp.

11:06.750 --> 11:11.086
Oh, actually Jillian does the shipping usually,
but I can do it if you tell me your...

11:11.421 --> 11:13.088
Hello? Fine.

11:15.759 --> 11:17.009
Oh, sh...

11:18.428 --> 11:19.428
Argh!

11:19.929 --> 11:22.222
You put a black light
in that Holiday Inn hotel room,

11:22.307 --> 11:25.517
it's gonna be nasty.
Never even saw the beach.

11:25.935 --> 11:26.935
-Excuse me.
-Whoo!

11:27.020 --> 11:30.647
If you want a piano player at your
crappy house, get one. This one's mine.

11:30.857 --> 11:32.566
He's jamming though. You don't hear this?

11:32.650 --> 11:34.109
Well, he's not taking requests, okay?

11:34.277 --> 11:36.195
-Hey. Waymond, give me that box.
-Why?

11:36.279 --> 11:38.697
"What's in the box?"

11:38.907 --> 11:40.282
-Have you ever seen Se7en?
-Yeah.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.493
-We've said it, like, seven times already today.
-Oh.

11:42.577 --> 11:46.080
Give me the box right now.
What's wrong with you, man?

11:46.539 --> 11:48.040
-Waymond!
-Hey.

11:49.417 --> 11:52.461
What are you doing? What are you...
No, no, no, no, no!

11:52.545 --> 11:54.296
Yo! Guys, want to help?

11:55.590 --> 11:58.300
-Waymond, what is your problem?
-Oh, he's strong.

11:58.385 --> 12:01.553
He's strong. He's strong. Whoa.

12:01.638 --> 12:03.472
Come on, trap him
in the closet in Adam's room.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.432
Oh, he's tough. He's slippery.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.226
Chill, man! Oh!

12:08.311 --> 12:11.355
Don't piss in my bed, fat...
Fatso. All right.

12:11.439 --> 12:14.149
I don't know. Maybe "chillax" means
something different in his country.

12:14.317 --> 12:16.902
Whoo! That was cool.
Waymond's freakin' strong.

12:16.986 --> 12:19.029
He's like a Chevy truck or something.

12:19.155 --> 12:21.573
-Very surprising.
-Too strong for you.

12:21.658 --> 12:25.077
He almost got the box...

12:25.161 --> 12:27.621
Which I put right there.
I swear to God, I putted it there.

12:27.705 --> 12:29.331
Dude, we got to find that box right now.

12:29.707 --> 12:33.836
"What's in the box?" From Se7en?

12:34.546 --> 12:37.631
Never seen it? Good flick. Cool twist.

12:38.007 --> 12:40.676
Which one of you lowlife
scumbags took my box?

12:42.137 --> 12:43.929
Hmm? I pay your rent.

12:44.013 --> 12:46.473
I put food on your table
after you put food on my table,

12:46.558 --> 12:48.642
and this is the thanks that I get?

12:49.894 --> 12:51.979
You're both fired,
and I want the wristband back.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.273
I don't have the wristband.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.860
Did you throw away my wristband?

12:58.862 --> 13:03.532
-I threw it away.
-Get the hell out of here before I go crazy.

13:04.826 --> 13:06.869
You mind if I stick around for a drink?

13:07.203 --> 13:08.370
Yes. You're a chick.

13:08.705 --> 13:10.539
Chicks never have to leave our house.
It's a house rule.

13:10.957 --> 13:13.083
Be a good Ghost and grab mama a drink.

13:13.209 --> 13:14.668
-I'll get you a drink.
-Shh.

13:14.878 --> 13:17.963
I can't breathe! Thank you.

13:18.756 --> 13:22.551
Of course. And I'm sorry about before...
The staring.

13:22.969 --> 13:25.262
It's just you look like my dead wife.

13:25.388 --> 13:28.223
Oh, Ghostman. That... I'm so sorry.
I didn't know.

13:28.933 --> 13:31.852
RIP, lady Ghostman. Come here.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.606
Wait a second. That's my woman!

13:35.690 --> 13:36.732
Whoa, what's going on?

13:39.068 --> 13:40.068
Oh, God.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.863
Get him! Get him!

13:42.947 --> 13:46.992
Holy shit! Guys! Come on!

13:47.076 --> 13:51.914
You're acting, well, nuts, actually.

13:51.998 --> 13:53.916
They both want a piece of the Jilly bean.

13:54.250 --> 13:55.584
What are you doing? Do you like these guys?

13:55.752 --> 13:58.128
-Oh, no. Not really.
-Then what're you doing?

13:58.213 --> 13:59.671
Why you teasing my dangle?

13:59.756 --> 14:01.340
Alice craps on me a lot,

14:01.424 --> 14:04.343
and I just wanted to see what it felt like
to do the crapping.

14:04.552 --> 14:08.096
Guys, you can't be trying to
twist each other's joints off, man.

14:08.556 --> 14:12.100
He's right. I only went at you so hard
'cause we're both so badass.

14:12.644 --> 14:14.561
Well, you see that waitress?

14:15.813 --> 14:19.107
I'm gonna tell her that you have
a monster wang.

14:19.400 --> 14:20.609
You wouldn't be lying.

14:26.407 --> 14:27.407
What

14:29.786 --> 14:32.955
-Totally all good.
-No problem.

14:34.791 --> 14:37.000
Freakin', oh, you can eat crazy peppers.

14:37.085 --> 14:40.087
Everyone loves Gil, don't they?

14:40.255 --> 14:42.256
I'll eat... I'll eat a freakin' million of those.

14:44.217 --> 14:47.094
Pepper. Mmm, ooh, it's so hot.

14:47.220 --> 14:50.305
It's so hot. Let me drip a little bit in my eyes.
It's so hot.

14:50.974 --> 14:53.475
-Rubby, rubby, rubby.
-I wouldn't do that.

14:53.810 --> 14:56.478
Ow! Shit!

14:56.771 --> 15:01.608
Ahhh, it's so hot! Ahhh! Oh, my God!

15:01.693 --> 15:04.319
It's so hot! It's so hot!

15:06.406 --> 15:07.823
Why won't it help me?

15:10.618 --> 15:12.452
That helps a little, actually.

15:13.454 --> 15:14.997
Oh! He's leaving!

15:16.749 --> 15:18.584
-Oh, hey.
-He's biting. Careful.

15:18.668 --> 15:20.836
-How'd he get out?
-Hey, man, chillax!

15:24.090 --> 15:27.259
Oh, my God. Come back!

15:27.468 --> 15:29.261
How did you do that? Hey!

15:31.556 --> 15:33.265
Adam. It's not...

15:33.349 --> 15:34.600
-I got it!
-You can't.

15:34.851 --> 15:36.310
-Just...
-I'm gonna go around.

15:36.394 --> 15:37.769
-Yeah, good call.
-Through the gate.

15:37.854 --> 15:39.813
-Good call. Yeah.
-Hey, boys.

15:39.897 --> 15:41.148
You want this box?

15:42.358 --> 15:46.445
Back up, or I'm gonna flood this box
like a high school girl on prom night.

15:46.863 --> 15:47.988
Ew.

15:49.365 --> 15:51.116
Drop it, Tez. All right?

15:51.200 --> 15:53.201
Just put the box down.
Not in the water though.

15:53.286 --> 15:54.620
Outside of the water though, please.

15:54.704 --> 15:56.580
Ooh, why you want the box so bad, huh?

15:56.664 --> 15:58.999
-Fess up.
-You know exactly what it is.

15:59.083 --> 16:01.460
-It is drugs, okay?
-Yeah.

16:01.544 --> 16:02.586
We're big-time drug dealers.

16:02.670 --> 16:04.880
We're about to make a big-time
drug deal, so just hand it over.

16:04.964 --> 16:06.632
There's someone at the door for you guys.

16:06.716 --> 16:08.467
-Says it's important.
-Thank you, Didi.

16:08.551 --> 16:09.635
It's the drop-off. It's a drop-off.

16:09.719 --> 16:11.511
Okay, I'm not kidding. You give me that box.

16:11.846 --> 16:13.889
No. You ain't getting nothing
with that cheap suit on.

16:14.057 --> 16:16.558
You back up too, Blake.
I could just sell this box

16:16.643 --> 16:19.144
myself and make all the money, huh?
How 'bout that?

16:19.228 --> 16:20.562
- Tez!

16:27.236 --> 16:29.863
Oh. Ooh.

16:30.156 --> 16:31.823
-Come on. Let's go.
-Okay, let's go.

16:31.908 --> 16:33.325
Why you gonna do me like that, man?

16:34.452 --> 16:36.912
- Come on. Oh, wow.

16:37.038 --> 16:39.581
-Help me.
-Yeah, I got you, dude. Whoa.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.458
I never seen your hair wet. It's cool.

16:42.001 --> 16:45.671
-What's going on, man? Huh?
-It's... You know what?

16:45.797 --> 16:48.006
-Colleen making more money than me.
-Uh-huh.

16:48.091 --> 16:49.841
I didn't get no sales last month.

16:50.093 --> 16:51.551
That's what you're worried about?

16:51.678 --> 16:55.263
You know what? I used to deal
those diggity-dang nugs back in high school.

16:55.348 --> 16:59.434
If y'all cut a brother in on the box,
I bet you I can up those profits.

17:00.645 --> 17:02.729
Grandma drug dealer. Perfect cover.

17:02.814 --> 17:05.982
-It really is.
-More like a gram-ma. Get it?

17:06.109 --> 17:08.652
'Cause you, like...
It's a common measurement in drugs.

17:08.820 --> 17:09.861
-That's good.
-Thanks.

17:09.946 --> 17:11.613
Nice one. Very good one.

17:12.949 --> 17:14.533
-Oh, man.
-Cops. Cops!

17:14.617 --> 17:16.451
Oh, my God. It's a sting. I knew it!

17:16.661 --> 17:18.995
-We're going to the booty house!
-Flush it. We got to flush 'em.

17:19.080 --> 17:20.872
-Flush it! Flush, flush, flush.
-Go, go, go. Go, go, go.

17:22.959 --> 17:24.376
Hey, we're busy here.

17:24.460 --> 17:28.839
Uh, we just need to use the toilet, so, uh...
Okay. Yup.

17:29.006 --> 17:32.718
-Baby, don't stop.
-I'm in love!

17:32.802 --> 17:34.469
Yeah, we'll just work around you.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.805
- What is this?
- What?

17:36.889 --> 17:38.056
The drugs must be inside.

17:38.141 --> 17:40.142
Here. Rip 'em open. Start flushing.

17:40.226 --> 17:41.560
-All right.
-Oh, yeah.

17:44.605 --> 17:49.109
Whoo! Yeah, baby, that's the good burn
right there.

17:49.193 --> 17:50.902
Yeah. Yeah, man.

17:50.987 --> 17:53.822
I know cocaine when I taste it on my lips.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.554
-Oh, snaps.
-Oh, wow.

18:17.680 --> 18:18.680
Oh, whoa, the cops are here.

18:18.765 --> 18:21.057
We received complaints about
a heavyset Asian man

18:21.142 --> 18:22.893
destroying front yards in the neighborhood.

18:23.686 --> 18:24.770
They said he came from here.

18:25.146 --> 18:29.107
So let me get this straight. He's in trouble,
and we're not in trouble for do...

18:29.192 --> 18:32.360
For... We're not in trouble.

18:33.196 --> 18:34.780
-You just keep the noise level down.
-Mmm-hmm.

18:35.364 --> 18:37.199
Another complaint, and you'll be cited.

18:41.287 --> 18:44.581
Woman, I tell you that right now...
Hey, are we doing this or what?

18:44.749 --> 18:46.708
We actually had to flush the
drugs when the cops got here.

18:46.834 --> 18:49.127
It was almost a huge bust,
so we just saved you.

18:49.212 --> 18:50.212
Drugs?

18:50.296 --> 18:54.591
I bought rare Princess Diana Beanie Babies
from Karl the collector.

18:54.675 --> 18:56.218
And I paid him up front.

18:56.636 --> 19:00.222
Well, I mean, if you really want 'em,
I think you could pull 'em out of the toilet.

19:00.306 --> 19:02.849
-I mean, they're just in pieces, but...
-The fabric's okay.

19:02.934 --> 19:05.602
You tell Karl he'll be hearing from me.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.647
- Whoa, whoa.

19:11.067 --> 19:12.275
He's insane

19:15.363 --> 19:20.283
Okay, we no longer need any of you here,
so ditch day is over.

19:22.495 --> 19:23.578
Ditch day?

19:23.830 --> 19:25.455
Everybody back to the office.

19:25.581 --> 19:30.627
Adam, Blake, Anders, you three
are suspended without pay until I feel like it.

19:30.753 --> 19:31.753
-What? It wasn't our...
-We were trying to...

19:31.838 --> 19:35.924
No. No. No! No! No! People were miserable.

19:36.259 --> 19:38.593
Adam, Blake, and Anders
were just trying to help.

19:38.761 --> 19:41.096
You treat us like you don't even
give a damn about us.

19:41.556 --> 19:43.932
Why are you even here now? I'll answer.

19:44.392 --> 19:46.268
For yourself. Uh-huh.

19:48.145 --> 19:49.980
I know. I...

19:51.023 --> 19:53.358
It's just sales get low,
and then I get stressed out,

19:53.442 --> 19:55.610
and all of that trickles down. I...

19:56.529 --> 19:58.280
I owe you an apology.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.659
Guys, I have an idea.

20:03.119 --> 20:07.789
What if we hit the freaking phones
and got corporate off Alice's back?

20:08.499 --> 20:11.126
-Come on!
-Yeah. Yeah, let's do that.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.210
Sure, hell yeah.

20:12.295 --> 20:14.337
- Come on! Yes!

20:14.422 --> 20:17.215
Okay. All right, sure. Yeah, why not.

20:17.300 --> 20:19.968
I mean... Thanks, Adam.

20:20.177 --> 20:22.304
Good idea. Major cool points.

20:24.765 --> 20:26.641
-I accept them.
-Great.

20:26.809 --> 20:30.228
Ding dong. Aloha, guys.

20:30.313 --> 20:34.065
It's me, Karl again. Whoa, hey.
Look, I got a text from Fran.

20:34.150 --> 20:37.193
She said the Beanie Baby
handoff didn't go as planned.

20:37.403 --> 20:38.904
-Sorry about that.
-That's all right.

20:38.988 --> 20:40.238
I'll just give her a good munchin'.

20:41.157 --> 20:43.658
Hey, check it out.
I got my coyotes across the bordie.

20:43.868 --> 20:45.660
You were talking about real coyotes?

20:46.287 --> 20:47.495
-Uh, yeah.
-That's cool.

20:47.580 --> 20:48.580
-Cool points.
-Yeah.

20:48.998 --> 20:50.665
Karl, those are wolves.

20:51.959 --> 20:54.502
-Wild wolves.
-Nuh-uh.

20:55.880 --> 20:56.880
I put ropes on 'em.

21:02.011 --> 21:03.887
-You bitch ass.
-You're the bitch ass.

21:03.971 --> 21:06.765
-I'm not afraid of you, dude.
-Stop. Stop this.

21:07.600 --> 21:10.101
-Okay, just stop, dude.
-Come on, dude. I'll run at you and do it.

21:10.186 --> 21:11.686
-Just stop.
-I'm not afraid of you.

21:11.896 --> 21:13.813
I'm not. What?

21:14.523 --> 21:17.025
Dude, I don't wanna... I don't wanna...
Okay, man.
