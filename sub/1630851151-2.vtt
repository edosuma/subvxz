24:23.444 --> 24:25.228
I guess I'd been spotted
around the Oval

24:25.315 --> 24:26.665
one too many times.

24:26.665 --> 24:28.014
You know that place--
people talk.

24:28.014 --> 24:30.016
-It's terrible.
-Yeah, and this is the part

24:30.103 --> 24:32.975
-that makes me upset because...
-Monica.

24:33.019 --> 24:34.673
Monica, you don't have
to tell me.

24:34.716 --> 24:37.197
No, it's fine, I...

24:37.240 --> 24:38.938
When I moved over here,
he called me a lot, at first.

24:40.679 --> 24:43.203
He invited my family to meet him
at a radio address

24:43.246 --> 24:45.205
when they were in town,
and when I went to Bosnia

24:45.248 --> 24:47.033
with Mr. Bacon,
he called the day

24:47.120 --> 24:49.035
I got home
to ask how it had gone.

24:49.122 --> 24:51.472
I still felt connected to him.

24:51.516 --> 24:53.779
And then the calls

24:53.822 --> 24:55.998
got less and less frequent.

24:56.042 --> 24:58.479
And now I realized...

24:58.523 --> 25:00.263
Occam's razor, Monica.

25:00.307 --> 25:02.352
He'd lost interest.

25:02.396 --> 25:04.137
And when he ever did call me,
it was probably just

25:04.180 --> 25:06.487
because he wanted to keep me
quiet through the election.

25:06.531 --> 25:08.924
-Mm.
-[Monica inhales deeply]

25:08.924 --> 25:11.013
My friends think I basically
need to be institutionalized

25:11.057 --> 25:13.450
because I barely go anywhere.

25:13.494 --> 25:16.062
And I have all these dumb gifts
just sitting in my apartment,

25:16.062 --> 25:18.804
waiting for the day he brings
me back to the White House

25:18.847 --> 25:21.850
like he promised and...

25:21.937 --> 25:24.374
now I realize
that's never gonna happen.

25:24.418 --> 25:26.942
It's over.

25:26.986 --> 25:29.554
And so I'm flying to Portland.

25:31.207 --> 25:32.992
To see my friend Cat
and try and relax.

25:32.992 --> 25:35.298
And...

25:35.385 --> 25:36.865
just try to stop
thinking about him

25:36.865 --> 25:39.564
for one single fucking minute.

25:42.349 --> 25:44.786
Linda, I feel so stupid.

25:47.093 --> 25:49.182
[Monica sniffles]

25:49.225 --> 25:51.314
I feel so stupid.

25:53.882 --> 25:56.058
I'm sorry to unload all this.

25:56.102 --> 25:57.799
I can't imagine
what you're thinking.

26:01.107 --> 26:02.978
Well...

26:03.022 --> 26:05.241
to be honest...

26:05.328 --> 26:07.766
listening to all this,

26:07.766 --> 26:09.811
this sounds
like it is absolutely...

26:12.031 --> 26:13.989
-...not over.
-What?

26:14.033 --> 26:15.425
Trust me, it's done.

26:15.469 --> 26:17.471
It's not done, Monica.

26:19.342 --> 26:21.693
What you're describing
sounds real.

26:21.780 --> 26:23.216
You think you're stuck in exile

26:23.259 --> 26:25.087
because he doesn't
have feelings for you?

26:25.131 --> 26:27.220
You have it backwards.

26:27.263 --> 26:29.352
My ex-friend Kathleen,

26:29.396 --> 26:31.354
they were always flirting.

26:31.441 --> 26:32.486
She had a crush.
One day, he kissed her.

26:32.573 --> 26:34.488
She wasn't sent away.

26:34.575 --> 26:36.577
You?

26:36.664 --> 26:38.231
You're sitting here
in the Pentagon right now

26:38.274 --> 26:40.276
because you were

26:40.363 --> 26:43.366
a threat, Monica.

26:43.453 --> 26:46.152
We both know there are
ten women in that building

26:46.239 --> 26:48.981
who have had something with him.

26:51.461 --> 26:53.289
They're all still there.

26:54.595 --> 26:57.380
You want to know why?

26:57.467 --> 26:59.992
[whispers]:
Because he doesn't care
about them.

27:02.734 --> 27:05.301
You're exhausted and upset.

27:06.738 --> 27:09.871
You are not seeing
this clearly at all.

27:13.875 --> 27:15.747
I don't know.

27:18.401 --> 27:20.186
I think, sadly, I am.

Can I just say...?

27:27.846 --> 27:29.848
-What?
-Look, I know this sounds funny,

27:29.891 --> 27:31.632

27:31.719 --> 27:33.503
I'm an extremely
intuitive person.

27:33.547 --> 27:35.854

Susan Carpenter-McMillan,
president and founder

30:25.458 --> 30:27.025
of the Women's Coalition.
We're a nonprofit that advocates

30:27.068 --> 30:28.504
for what I like to call...

30:28.504 --> 30:30.245
"conservative feminism."

30:30.289 --> 30:31.812
Okay.

30:31.856 --> 30:33.379
-Wonderful.
-I was at an event

30:33.379 --> 30:36.034
for the Right to Life League
and Susie came up

30:36.121 --> 30:37.905
and said she knew who I was.

of commentary in support

30:39.689 --> 30:41.604

And I thought,
oh, my gosh, how nice.

And she told me that she thought
I was being treated poorly.

Well... just to bring you
up to speed,

31:18.206 --> 31:20.513
Clinton's team has been arguing

31:20.600 --> 31:23.646
that a sitting president is
immune to lawsuits like Paula's.

31:23.690 --> 31:26.171
Fucking lowlifes.

31:26.214 --> 31:29.174
[clears throat] And now
the Supreme Court has agreed

to step in
and rule on that question.

working on our arguments.

Well, I just want
to help however I can.

32:01.119 --> 32:04.644
And Susie was thinking maybe
I could do some TV appearances

32:04.687 --> 32:07.038
since no one on TV is saying
my side of things.

32:07.125 --> 32:09.431
I would not advise going on TV.

32:09.475 --> 32:11.868
All that matters right now
is the Supreme Court.

that made it legal

-to murder children?
-What? Oh, my gosh.

32:15.698 --> 32:17.483
Yes, unborn children.

32:17.483 --> 32:20.138
You see, I have to disagree
with you about television.

32:20.181 --> 32:22.662
I have never heard of a case

32:22.705 --> 32:24.577
that couldn't benefit
from a little outside pressure.

32:24.620 --> 32:27.058
The justices are
political animals just

32:27.058 --> 32:29.364
like everyone else in this town.

32:29.364 --> 32:31.714
I just want people
to see my side of it.

32:31.801 --> 32:33.455
Paula, I assure you...

32:33.499 --> 32:34.935
they will.

32:37.068 --> 32:39.244
Please, let's get to work.

I'm thinking Stevens, Breyer,

32:41.594 --> 32:43.248
Ginsburg, Souter...
[sighs]

32:43.291 --> 32:45.119
This isn't gonna win them over.

32:45.163 --> 32:46.381
I'm not worried
about the liberals.

32:46.425 --> 32:48.296
They've argued for decades
that a president

32:48.383 --> 32:50.298
should be treated
like an ordinary citizen.

32:50.385 --> 32:52.083
They have to take Paula's side.

32:52.083 --> 32:53.910
I always
say you can never go wrong

integrity of liberals.

32:56.652 --> 32:59.307

at MSNBC.

32:59.394 --> 33:01.962
-They fired me.
-Again?

with this simpering peacenik

33:04.660 --> 33:07.533

we lost the war."

33:25.768 --> 33:27.857
Really?

33:27.901 --> 33:29.555
Really. What are we doing?

33:29.642 --> 33:31.948
Uh, preparing, uh, briefs

33:31.992 --> 33:33.341
to help out Paula's lawyers.

33:33.428 --> 33:35.735
Oh, tough case.

33:35.778 --> 33:37.519
Do the laws apply
to our head of state

33:37.563 --> 33:39.739
or is he
an infallible sovereign?

33:39.782 --> 33:43.221
Not as though the country was
founded on that exact concept.

33:43.264 --> 33:45.353
They'll argue her suit
will distract him

33:45.440 --> 33:47.790
from him presidential duties.

33:47.790 --> 33:50.750
When do we get to the part
where he's deposed and he lies?

33:50.793 --> 33:52.665
Oh, well, after this, if the
court finds in Paula's favor.

33:52.708 --> 33:55.015
I have a law degree.

33:55.102 --> 33:56.451
It was a rhetorical question.

-excruciating detail."
-Well, to be clear,

34:12.032 --> 34:13.903
the goal isn't to embarrass him.

34:13.947 --> 34:15.992
I-It's to constrain
a president who has engaged

34:16.036 --> 34:17.603
-in illicit activities.
-I'm bored.

34:17.646 --> 34:19.822
You're boring.

34:19.909 --> 34:21.911
That's the problem
with you Republicans.

34:21.955 --> 34:23.391
You're a Republican.

34:23.391 --> 34:24.827
Mm, I'm a conservative.

-Um, he lost.

for Paula.

Oh, this isn't about justice.

34:57.425 --> 34:59.732

34:59.775 --> 35:01.995
Impeachment, Jerome.

35:06.434 --> 35:08.132

35:09.785 --> 35:10.960
I want you to tell me

your honest-to-goodness opinion,
okay?

35:17.967 --> 35:20.100
MAN [on TV]:
On May 8, 1991,

35:20.144 --> 35:22.320
Paula Jones,
a state employee

35:22.407 --> 35:25.323
with the Arkansas Industrial
Development Commission,

35:25.410 --> 35:27.063
was working
the registration desk

35:27.107 --> 35:28.891
for the Governor's
Quality Management Conference

35:28.935 --> 35:31.067
at the Excelsior Hotel.

35:31.111 --> 35:33.853
Governor Bill Clinton was
to be the main speaker.

35:33.896 --> 35:37.117
He tried to lean in
on me and grab--

35:37.161 --> 35:39.337
Well, he-he...

35:39.380 --> 35:41.904
he tried to put
his hand up my leg.

35:41.904 --> 35:43.776
And it... which I...

35:43.819 --> 35:46.213
It all happened so fast.

35:46.257 --> 35:49.695
And Bill Clinton asked me
to perform oral sex,

35:49.782 --> 35:51.175
which I declined.

35:52.915 --> 35:54.874
And I told the governor I'm not

35:54.917 --> 35:57.311
that kind of girl
and I walked right out.

35:57.355 --> 36:00.227
I went to my desk-- I told
my coworker the whole story.

36:00.271 --> 36:01.924
And that is what happened.

36:01.968 --> 36:03.491
Isn't that right?

36:03.578 --> 36:06.015
Yes, Paula.

36:06.059 --> 36:09.323
My husband's very outraged.

36:09.367 --> 36:11.238
STEVE:
I'm just-- I'm just glad
I wasn't there,

36:11.282 --> 36:12.805
-I can tell you that.
-Me, too.

36:12.848 --> 36:15.721
Gil and Joe said never
show this ever to anyone,

36:15.808 --> 36:18.593
but this is a real video

36:18.637 --> 36:21.248

Jerry Falwell at his churches.

36:21.292 --> 36:24.338
Oh. Okay.

36:24.382 --> 36:26.122
And I was thinking
about what you said.

36:26.166 --> 36:28.037
And if we got
this out there more--

36:28.081 --> 36:30.692
if it was on TV, you know,

36:30.736 --> 36:32.738
people would see my side.

36:32.825 --> 36:35.306
Um... I don't know,
what do you think?

36:36.785 --> 36:38.961
Um, what is this?

36:39.005 --> 36:40.746

-Mmm.

It's French.

36:48.754 --> 36:50.538
You're wonderful in it.

36:50.582 --> 36:52.758
So real.

36:52.845 --> 36:54.977
You have a look that says...

36:54.977 --> 36:57.589
"rural Arkansas."

36:57.632 --> 37:00.418
That, I love, but city people
don't always like that.

37:00.461 --> 37:01.984
Even city people
who vote Republican.

37:02.028 --> 37:03.682
Mm. Yeah.

37:04.987 --> 37:07.207
They want to believe you.

we were the Church

38:34.294 --> 38:36.644
you'd say it was kind of strict
on the length.

I'm a conservative feminist.

you don't have to be a lesbian
