00:03.170 --> 00:04.376
Give me the ring!

00:04.460 --> 00:07.167
I have some news. Claire found Jamie.

00:07.250 --> 00:08.797
We 7/ pay what we owe in taxes.

00:08.920 --> 00:11.582
The corruption
of the Governor's sheriffs

00:11.680 --> 00:13.545
and tax collectors must end!

00:13.840 --> 00:14.829
I love you.

00:14.930 --> 00:16.136
Will you marry me?

00:16.430 --> 00:18.762
I'm not ready for this.

00:18.970 --> 00:20.597
Her mother found a lost love.

00:20.680 --> 00:23.843
You mean when she went back
in time to find Jamie Fraser?

00:24.100 --> 00:26.011
I wasn ’1‘ sure if] should show you.

00:26.110 --> 00:27.395
An obituary?

Roger,
I found out something terr/b/e

00:34.530 --> 00:36.771

All that was fair

02:36.400 --> 02:39.153
Pardon me, ladies.
I'm looking for this woman.

02:41.160 --> 02:42.149
Yourself, sir?

02:44.290 --> 02:45.655
All right. Thank you.

02:50.750 --> 02:51.990
No, sorry.

02:52.710 --> 02:53.699
Thank you.

03:25.450 --> 03:27.361
My establishment offend you
in some way, sir?

03:29.120 --> 03:31.111
No, no.

03:31.540 --> 03:32.529
It's only that...

03:35.460 --> 03:36.870
I'm looking for this lady.

03:37.920 --> 03:39.751
She recently arrived
on the
Ph/l/io Alonzo.

03:39.840 --> 03:42.331
I've made inquiries,
but no one's seen her.

03:42.930 --> 03:44.136
I haven't either.

03:45.010 --> 03:46.637
Have you completed your inventory?

03:46.720 --> 03:49.382
Yes, sir. We'll need 12 more
composing sticks come Thursday.

03:49.480 --> 03:50.469
All right.

03:51.230 --> 03:52.686
Sir, have you seen this lady?

03:55.860 --> 03:56.849
I'm sorry, I haven't.

04:19.920 --> 04:21.046
Where's the bairn?

04:21.630 --> 04:22.927
Go see for yerself.

04:27.140 --> 04:28.425
Milady. Milord.

04:28.510 --> 04:30.307
I'm so glad ye could come for a visit.

04:32.100 --> 04:34.933
- Is Ian not with you?
- He'll be along tomorrow.

04:35.020 --> 04:37.978
He's gone to Brunswick
to fetch casks for our whiskey.

04:38.400 --> 04:42.029
The Governor has invited us
to join him and his wife at the theatre.

04:42.110 --> 04:44.908
- Summoned us to join him.
- You came all this way for a play?

04:44.990 --> 04:47.072
No, we came all this way to see you.

04:47.160 --> 04:49.537
- And Germain.
- Shall I put him down?

04:49.620 --> 04:51.247
Hmm.

04:51.700 --> 04:53.156
The Governor's eager to introduce me

04:53.250 --> 04:56.629
to one of his right-hand men,
Mr Edmund Fanning.

04:56.880 --> 05:00.589
A right-hand man with both his hands
dipped in the treasury,

05:00.670 --> 05:02.251
- or so Murtagh would tell us.
-Mmmmmm.

05:02.340 --> 05:04.717
Marsali, shall I help you
get the rest of lunch?

05:04.800 --> 05:05.789
Yes.

05:13.520 --> 05:14.976
So, how are you all coping,

05:15.900 --> 05:18.221
you and Fergus, with the baby?

05:22.740 --> 05:24.810
Being a mother to a wee bairn...

05:26.280 --> 05:29.579
My heart is so full of love
it's fit to burst.

05:32.870 --> 05:33.859
But...

05:37.000 --> 05:38.376
Is something the matter?

05:38.460 --> 05:40.701
No, 'tis only...

05:42.300 --> 05:44.336
With Germain being so precious...

05:46.340 --> 05:51.926
I look at him and I ken
I'd have a knife through my gut

05:52.020 --> 05:55.228
before seeing him hurt or in sorrow.

05:56.600 --> 05:59.933
If anything should ever happen to him...

06:01.980 --> 06:04.392
That's the hardest thing
about being a parent.

06:05.110 --> 06:06.099
I'm sure.

06:07.610 --> 06:10.488
Though you know you would die trying,

06:11.830 --> 06:15.118
you can't protect them
from everyone and everything.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.626
Mmm.

06:41.480 --> 06:42.686
For Christ's sake.

07:03.380 --> 07:05.450
- Excuse me.
- Yes, lass?

07:05.630 --> 07:08.622
Do you know where I might be
able to buy passage to Cross Creek?

07:08.720 --> 07:10.460
I'd like to leave tomorrow.

07:10.760 --> 07:12.000
The
Sa/ly,4nn
is in port.

07:12.100 --> 07:13.499
It makes the journey every week or so.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.136
You can ask Captain Freeman.

07:15.220 --> 07:16.380
Thank you.

07:20.020 --> 07:21.089
Bnanna?

07:24.610 --> 07:25.816
It's you.

07:30.360 --> 07:31.850
Oh, thank God.

07:33.070 --> 07:35.573
- Thank God I found you.
- Hi.

07:41.540 --> 07:44.373
Oh, my God. What are you doing here?

07:44.460 --> 07:45.495
Looking for you.

07:46.380 --> 07:49.713
At no small risk to life and limb,
I might add.

07:49.800 --> 07:52.758
You weren't supposed to come here.
That wasn't the plan.

07:53.300 --> 07:56.007
What, and you call tearing off
into bloody nowhere a plan?

07:56.510 --> 07:58.387
No, I would've told you. I just...

07:59.480 --> 08:02.267
I didn't know where we stood
after the last time we talked.

08:02.810 --> 08:04.766
What do you mean,
you didn't know where we stood?

08:06.610 --> 08:08.271
You didn't know how I feel about you?

08:14.450 --> 08:15.576
Let's go outside.

08:21.750 --> 08:22.785
Roger, wait.

08:22.870 --> 08:26.283
- How did you even know where I was?
- I spoke to Gayle.

08:26.630 --> 08:28.291
She told me you were
going to visit your mum.

08:28.670 --> 08:30.456
So I went to find you in Inverness.

08:31.760 --> 08:34.251
- You read my letter.
- Of course, I read your letter.

08:34.340 --> 08:37.503
And that's all I got, a letter?
You could have called me.

08:37.600 --> 08:40.558
I wanted to call you, but I didn't know
how to tell you that I love you,

08:40.640 --> 08:43.973
and I thought that if I told you
I was coming here, you'd try to stop me.

08:46.610 --> 08:48.066
Did you just say you love me?

08:53.030 --> 08:54.190
Come with me.

09:12.340 --> 09:13.580
Close the door.

09:28.770 --> 09:30.510
Wait. Stop.

09:30.610 --> 09:32.237
- What?
- Stop.

09:34.280 --> 09:35.269
Are you sure?

09:37.410 --> 09:39.617
Do you not know how badly I want you?

09:40.240 --> 09:41.229
But...

09:42.370 --> 09:43.655
We're not engaged.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.786
That seemed to be very important to you.

09:47.830 --> 09:49.161
At the festival, you said...

09:49.250 --> 09:50.456
I said...

09:53.970 --> 09:56.177
I said I would have all of you
or none at all.

09:59.640 --> 10:00.880
Have you changed your mind?

10:06.020 --> 10:07.055
No.

10:13.110 --> 10:14.236
Well, then...

10:17.660 --> 10:18.900
You have all of me.

10:22.830 --> 10:23.819
You'll marry me?

10:29.460 --> 10:33.453
How could I say no to a man
who pursued me for 200 years?

10:42.260 --> 10:43.466
I don't have a ring.

10:44.220 --> 10:46.222
I still have the bracelet you gave me.

10:50.770 --> 10:53.318
It's the gemstone you used
to come through the stones.

10:59.820 --> 11:01.060
I have an idea.

11:02.450 --> 11:03.735
D'ye know what "handfasting" is?

11:05.040 --> 11:07.110
It's...

11:08.960 --> 11:10.996
It's sort of a temporary marriage.

11:12.040 --> 11:13.120
In the Highlands,

11:14.130 --> 11:17.008
where... Where folk are a long way
from the nearest minister,

11:17.090 --> 11:18.876
a man and a woman, in this time,

11:18.970 --> 11:21.632
can be promised to one another
for a year and a day.

11:21.720 --> 11:23.676
- At the end of that time...
- Let's do it.

11:27.220 --> 11:28.221
Really?

11:31.060 --> 11:32.049
Yes.

11:53.630 --> 11:56.417
Very pleased you could join us,
Mister and Mistress Fraser.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.719
This play is said to be
quite exceptional.

12:00.630 --> 12:03.133
Indeed, it was written by
a native son of Wilmington.

12:06.640 --> 12:07.629
Ah!

12:07.720 --> 12:08.709
Fanning!

12:08.810 --> 12:10.596
Come, come. Come.

12:11.310 --> 12:12.641
I must introduce you to a friend.

12:13.770 --> 12:17.183
Mr Fanning, may I present
Mr James Fraser of Fraser's Ridge.

12:17.270 --> 12:19.397
Mr Edmund Fanning,
my dear friend and colleague.

12:20.570 --> 12:23.448
A pleasure, sir. My wife, Claire Fraser.

12:24.490 --> 12:26.981
Mr Fanning sits on the Assembly
and is my public Register of Deeds.

12:27.080 --> 12:30.072
He's also, I might add,
leader of the Orange County militia

12:30.160 --> 12:33.243
and judge of the Superior Court
in Salisbury, in your county.

12:33.710 --> 12:35.621
A man with many strings to his bow.

12:35.710 --> 12:38.793
His Excellency speaks highly
of you as well, Mr Fraser,

12:39.170 --> 12:42.674
especially in the light of our current
grievances in the western counties.

12:43.840 --> 12:44.966
The Regulators?

12:45.050 --> 12:47.632
Do not dignify those insurgents
with that name.

12:47.720 --> 12:49.210
I would be ashamed to declare anyone

12:49.310 --> 12:51.050
save the Lord above

12:51.140 --> 12:53.222
a "regulator" of all things.

12:53.560 --> 12:55.187
Are you in pain, Mr Fanning?

12:55.690 --> 12:59.069
Oh, I'm afraid I injured myself
standing against the mob

12:59.150 --> 13:01.641
which assembled
in Hillsborough last May.

13:01.740 --> 13:03.446
Quite literally standing, mind you.

13:03.530 --> 13:05.066
I am an object of jest.

13:05.570 --> 13:07.197
In an attempt to appease the insurgents,

13:07.280 --> 13:10.078
I carried rum to the river
where they were encamped,

13:10.490 --> 13:13.493
meaning to persuade them
against their lawlessness.

13:13.580 --> 13:17.539
A noble deed, one which preserved
the lives of many, I'm sure.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.003
As I turned to leave,
my boot stayed in the mud,

13:21.090 --> 13:23.217
and I must have wounded myself.

13:23.550 --> 13:25.427
I've a strange protrusion.

13:26.180 --> 13:29.559
The least movement now sends me
Into parowsms of pain.

13:30.310 --> 13:33.052
My physician assures me
it will go away in time.

13:33.140 --> 13:35.688
Not if it is what I think it might be.

13:35.770 --> 13:38.352
If I were to examine it,
I could know for sure.

13:39.650 --> 13:41.561
My wife is a healer, Mr Fanning.

13:41.820 --> 13:42.855
Ah...

13:43.070 --> 13:46.562
Well, let us defer
to Mr Fanning's physician, shall we?

13:47.030 --> 13:50.409
Well, if the pain gets worse,
you may need to see a surgeon.

13:51.790 --> 13:55.112
Mr Fraser, allow me to introduce you
to some of my acquaintances.

13:55.210 --> 13:57.701
My wife will present
Mistress Fraser to the wives.

13:58.290 --> 13:59.279
Please.

14:07.550 --> 14:09.381
The society of the wives.

14:11.060 --> 14:12.300
Indeed.

14:13.350 --> 14:16.638
But fear not, I will help you
navigate these waters.

14:18.310 --> 14:19.299
Ah, there.

14:19.900 --> 14:22.528
You've heard of the face
that launched a thousand ships.

14:22.610 --> 14:27.024
Well, here's a lady who could fill
as many with tobacco, if she so chose.

14:27.660 --> 14:29.730
Wit and wealth aplenty.

14:31.910 --> 14:35.494
Her husband seems to have captured
the attention of the crowd as well.

14:35.580 --> 14:36.865
That's Colonel Washington.

14:38.790 --> 14:39.996
I'm sorry, who?

14:40.750 --> 14:42.240
Colonel George Washington.

14:42.500 --> 14:45.003
He's a former soldier
with the Virginia Regiment.

14:48.220 --> 14:50.381
Well, I should love to meet them both.

14:56.390 --> 15:00.429
Mister and Mistress Fraser
recently settled their own estate,

15:00.810 --> 15:03.472
ten thousand acres
in the Blue Ridge Mountains.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.856
The parcel that Mr Washington
surveyed for me last year.

15:05.940 --> 15:07.020
Yes, I remember.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.526
A magnificent stretch of wilderness.

15:09.610 --> 15:11.566
Aye, good land,

15:12.490 --> 15:14.481
so generously granted to us
by His Excellency.

15:15.080 --> 15:17.446
Hitherto unprecedented generosity.

15:17.910 --> 15:19.150
Ten thousand acres.

15:19.870 --> 15:21.622
The Governor must be quite fond of you.

15:21.710 --> 15:23.166
Of course, I'm fond of him.

15:23.420 --> 15:26.628
Mr Fraser is a loyal man.
A former soldier, you know.

15:26.710 --> 15:27.836
Oh?

15:27.970 --> 15:29.460
Were you with us against the French?

15:29.550 --> 15:30.539
No.

15:31.220 --> 15:34.553
But I've heard tales of
your husband's explorts In those wars.

15:35.970 --> 15:39.019
I fought at Culloden in '46.

15:40.190 --> 15:41.760
I do not recall that battle.

15:43.020 --> 15:44.567
I spent my youth in Virginia.

15:44.770 --> 15:46.431
Chopping down cherry trees...

15:50.030 --> 15:52.237
Is what a young boy would do.

15:52.700 --> 15:53.769
Figure of speech.

15:55.530 --> 15:59.364
Ladies and gentlemen,
the play will soon begin.

15:59.580 --> 16:00.706
Ah...

16:00.790 --> 16:02.200
Let us be seated.

16:10.380 --> 16:11.460
George Washington.

16:12.010 --> 16:15.173
He will be, perhaps,
the most famous American to ever live.

16:18.060 --> 16:20.472
Well, he's the man who wins
the war against the British,

16:20.730 --> 16:22.846
and he'll be the first leader
of this country.

16:23.440 --> 16:25.146
But he won't be a king.

16:25.650 --> 16:29.188
He'll be called a "president,"
elected by the people.

16:31.530 --> 16:35.409
If Brianna were here, she'd have
a hundred questions to ask him.

16:44.830 --> 16:47.993
Yeah, I think we're supposed to kneel.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.621
I, Roger Jeremiah,

17:32.970 --> 17:34.335
do take thee,

17:35.090 --> 17:38.423
Brianna Ellen,
to be my lawful wedded wife.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.516
With my goods I thee endow,

17:43.850 --> 17:45.590
with my body I thee worship,

17:46.730 --> 17:48.686
in sickness and in health,

17:49.270 --> 17:51.181
in richness and in poverty,

17:52.110 --> 17:53.896
so long as we both shall live.

17:54.570 --> 17:56.151
I plight thee my troth.

18:01.120 --> 18:03.327
I, Brianna Ellen,

18:04.460 --> 18:06.917
take thee, Roger Jeremiah,

18:08.000 --> 18:09.877
to be my lawful wedded husband.

18:11.340 --> 18:15.128
With my goods I thee endow,

18:15.470 --> 18:17.370
not that there's much of that.

18:19.850 --> 18:21.590
With my body I thee worship,

18:23.970 --> 18:25.972
in sickness and in health,

18:26.560 --> 18:28.471
in richness and in poverty,

18:29.810 --> 18:31.607
so long as we both shall live.

18:34.900 --> 18:36.447
- The plight.
- Right.

18:36.530 --> 18:39.772
I plight thee my troth.

18:42.030 --> 18:43.782
By the power vested in

18:45.040 --> 18:48.783
this unusual Scottish tradition, I...

18:49.000 --> 18:50.911
I now pronounce us...

18:52.880 --> 18:54.620
- Man and wife.
- Man and wife.

19:34.290 --> 19:36.042
Has my mistress returned?

19:36.340 --> 19:37.967
No, still off with that man.

19:38.550 --> 19:40.120
The man of wanton morals?

20:04.870 --> 20:08.112
The Regulators
mean to deprive me of my home.

20:08.660 --> 20:10.787
They refuse to see
their taxes apportioned

20:10.870 --> 20:12.701
for the construction of my palace.

20:13.670 --> 20:15.991
Well, let's hope my men
put on a good show tonight.

20:17.550 --> 20:18.539
I'm sorry?

20:19.800 --> 20:21.756
"All the world's a stage,

20:22.010 --> 20:25.753
"and all the men and women
merely players.

20:26.510 --> 20:28.808
"They have their exits
and their entrances."

20:29.600 --> 20:32.091
Shakespeare, you know.
Never goes out of fashion.

20:32.190 --> 20:36.229
Aye. But it's not Shakespeare
we're seeing tonight, Your Excellency.

20:36.320 --> 20:37.389
Indeed not,

20:37.480 --> 20:41.314
but we are at a theatre of His Majesty
the King in all its glory,

20:41.400 --> 20:44.654
made possible through taxes.

20:45.320 --> 20:47.402
Not something those insurgents
would ever comprehend.

20:47.490 --> 20:49.117
- A night to remember.
-Mmm.

20:51.660 --> 20:53.457
But what has this to do with yer men?

20:54.580 --> 20:56.161
- The insurgents?
- Yeah.

20:57.290 --> 20:59.292
I have a spy in their camp.

21:00.630 --> 21:02.507
They mean to rob a carriage

21:02.590 --> 21:05.332
carrying tax monies
to the treasury at New Bern,

21:05.430 --> 21:07.637
tonight, as it leaves Wilmington.

21:09.010 --> 21:11.092
They're here, gentlemen,

21:11.430 --> 21:13.728
encamped upon the road to New Bern.

21:14.310 --> 21:16.266
My Redcoats are going to arrest them.

21:18.190 --> 21:21.023
Do ye ken who these men are?

21:21.110 --> 21:22.236
Oh, yes.

21:22.950 --> 21:26.067
And they have a leader among them,
Murtagh Fitzgibbons.

21:31.200 --> 21:32.497
Mmm.

21:32.750 --> 21:36.072
If ye'd like,
I could ride out and join yer men.

21:36.540 --> 21:38.952
Oh, I appreciate your offer,
but I have it in hand.

21:39.500 --> 21:40.956
- Enjoy the performance.
- Aye.

21:55.640 --> 21:57.050
He comes.

24:10.070 --> 24:11.606
Your skin is so soft.

24:18.870 --> 24:21.282
You're the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

25:06.330 --> 25:08.332
I've wanted this for so long.

25:09.710 --> 25:11.871
If I take you now, it's for always.

25:13.430 --> 25:14.419
Yes.

25:16.340 --> 25:18.171
Yes, please.

25:55.880 --> 25:57.211
Feel my heart.

25:59.430 --> 26:01.136
Tell me if it stops.

26:29.790 --> 26:30.870
- What?
- Just...

26:33.090 --> 26:34.830
I want to make this last.

26:53.190 --> 26:54.987
I've been wondering for a while,

26:55.530 --> 26:57.566
what colour your hair is down here.

27:01.030 --> 27:02.861
It's...

27:05.120 --> 27:06.906
I'm gonna find out for myself.

27:18.260 --> 27:19.921
And what's that name?

27:20.010 --> 27:22.296
- What splendid robes.
- Thank you, sir.

27:22.390 --> 27:26.599
Ambient air, and weary gracious heaven
with ceaseless bellowings.

27:26.890 --> 27:28.380
Your ceaseless bellowings.

27:29.600 --> 27:32.353
_Vardanes sounds
wrth equal harmony,

27:32.440 --> 27:35.523
and suits as well
the loud repeated shouts

27:35.610 --> 27:36.986
of noisy joy.

27:37.070 --> 27:39.482
Can he bid Chaos Nature's rule dissolve?

27:39.570 --> 27:40.559
I don't know.

27:40.660 --> 27:43.618
Can he deprive mankind
of light and day,

27:44.080 --> 27:46.537
and turn the seasons
from their destined course?

27:46.910 --> 27:48.866
- Such poetry.
- What poetry?

27:48.960 --> 27:52.703
Say, can he do all this and be a god?

28:18.820 --> 28:20.196
Patience, lads.

28:29.410 --> 28:30.741
Can I ask you something?

28:31.870 --> 28:32.859
Anything.

28:34.380 --> 28:36.951
Was it all right? Did I do it right?

28:37.380 --> 28:38.665
Oh, God.

28:41.300 --> 28:43.791
- It was all right, then?
- Christ, yes.

28:45.180 --> 28:47.808
What could possibly
make you think otherwise?

28:47.890 --> 28:49.710
Well, you didn't say anything.

28:50.310 --> 28:53.552
You just lay there like someone
had hit you over the head.

28:55.480 --> 28:57.220
I thought maybe you were disappointed.

28:57.320 --> 28:59.276
No! No.

29:00.490 --> 29:01.684
God, no.

29:02.740 --> 29:05.982
Behaving as though you've had
your spinal column removed

29:06.070 --> 29:10.325
is a fair indication
of male satisfaction.

29:17.840 --> 29:19.125
Can I ask you something?

29:19.550 --> 29:20.539
Of course,

29:21.300 --> 29:22.289
husband.

29:23.470 --> 29:26.257
Did it hurt? The first time?

29:26.340 --> 29:27.386
Yes,

29:29.010 --> 29:30.466
but I liked it.

29:37.690 --> 29:40.682
When I thought of our wedding night,
I always pictured

29:41.730 --> 29:44.858
clean sheets, champagne,

29:45.910 --> 29:47.229
a bed.

29:50.620 --> 29:52.030
I have those things.

29:55.080 --> 29:56.365
Not this.

30:09.600 --> 30:11.921
I don't think I've ever been so happy.

30:27.700 --> 30:28.769
Bree...

30:39.210 --> 30:42.748
What dares he, Vardanes dares not?

30:42.840 --> 30:44.501
Blush not, noble prince.

30:44.590 --> 30:45.750
Have pity.

30:46.220 --> 30:47.676
I'd loud proclaim

30:47.760 --> 30:49.671
the merits of Vardanes.

30:50.010 --> 30:52.592
Brother, my soul
endures him not,

30:52.680 --> 30:56.172
and he's the bane
of all my hopes of greatness.

30:56.270 --> 30:57.589
Artless verse.

30:57.770 --> 30:59.146
No rhyme intended.

30:59.730 --> 31:03.109
Like the sun, he rules the day,

31:03.190 --> 31:05.567
and like the night's pale queen,

31:05.940 --> 31:08.852
my fainter beams are lost
when he appears.

31:08.950 --> 31:12.113
And this because he came into the world
a moon or two before me.

31:12.200 --> 31:13.656
What's the difference?

31:15.250 --> 31:16.694
Christ, forgive me.

31:17.160 --> 31:18.240
This man needs a surgeon!

31:18.670 --> 31:20.035
Colonel, please help me.

31:20.120 --> 31:22.031
Apologies, ladies and gentlemen.

31:22.380 --> 31:24.450
Players, I'm sorry.
This man is in distress.

31:24.590 --> 31:26.376
This man is dying!
Is there a surgeon present?

31:26.460 --> 31:28.872
_ _ - Here.
- My wrfe IS a surgeon, Your Excellency.

31:28.970 --> 31:29.959
You said she was a healer.

31:30.050 --> 31:31.290
I mean, herbs and potions
are one thing, but this...

31:31.390 --> 31:33.676
Bring him into the lobby.
Lay him flat on his back.

31:33.760 --> 31:34.886
Now, please.

31:34.970 --> 31:36.267
- Now! Now!
- I'm sorry.

31:42.650 --> 31:44.220
No, if he's suffering
from what I think he is,

31:44.320 --> 31:46.470
you may have just saved his life
by forcing me to operate.

31:46.570 --> 31:48.435
Governor Tryon is gonna arrest a gang

31:48.530 --> 31:50.236
of Regulators tonight,
here in Wilmington.

31:50.320 --> 31:52.231
- Murtagh's among them.
- Arrest them for what?

31:52.320 --> 31:53.776
Robbery. A hanging offence.

31:53.870 --> 31:56.191
I must go warn Murtagh,
but Tryon canna ken I've gone.

31:56.290 --> 31:57.325
Will ye keep him occupied?

31:57.950 --> 32:01.408
I'll buy you as much time as I can,
but be careful.

32:09.920 --> 32:11.296
Inguinal hernia.

32:11.760 --> 32:14.752
His intestines have moved,
and the blood flow may be cut off.

32:14.850 --> 32:16.465
I need to operate immediately.

32:16.970 --> 32:20.133
You, go behind the stage
and find me a needle and thread.

32:20.310 --> 32:23.552
And you, sir, go next door
and fetch me a small, sharp knife,

32:23.650 --> 32:26.187
some liquor and some linens.
Lots of linens.

32:26.270 --> 32:27.976
Frohock, for God's sake,
find us a surgeon.

32:28.070 --> 32:30.948
I am a surgeon, Your Excellency,
and I cannot wait.

32:31.030 --> 32:32.657
Now, if you would be so kind
as to assist me...

32:32.740 --> 32:34.981
Should we not undertake this
somewhere more private?

32:35.070 --> 32:36.230
We'll have him carried to the inn.

32:36.330 --> 32:38.742
If I don't act quickly,
this man will die.

32:42.170 --> 32:45.492
Mr Fanning, I need you
to take a long drink

32:45.590 --> 32:47.876
and hope that it knocks you unconscious.

32:52.340 --> 32:53.466
How is the patient?

32:55.680 --> 32:57.750
My wife will do her best to help him.

33:00.140 --> 33:01.129
She's very skilled.

33:01.230 --> 33:02.549
Excellent news.

33:03.140 --> 33:05.188
- Ye're leaving?
- We are indeed.

33:05.270 --> 33:06.931
What a lugubrious performance.

33:07.440 --> 33:08.429
You're leaving as well?

33:09.780 --> 33:14.069
Well, I must fetch my wife's
surgical tools from our residence.

33:17.030 --> 33:18.577
May we offer you transport?

33:21.080 --> 33:22.069
Aye.

33:25.540 --> 33:27.997
Here you are, mistress.
I brought you this as well.

33:28.090 --> 33:29.990
Thank you. Put them down.

33:30.090 --> 33:32.331
No, we don't need more rum.
It's already taken effect.

33:32.420 --> 33:35.082
- He looks so pale.
- He's at death's door.

33:35.180 --> 33:36.966
Where is the needle and thread?

33:39.140 --> 33:40.255
Thank you.

33:46.350 --> 33:47.476
What are you doing?

33:47.770 --> 33:50.978
I'm cleaning the area
where I'm going to make an incision.

33:52.570 --> 33:55.482
I need four men
to hold down his arms and legs

33:55.570 --> 33:57.561
and keep him still while I work.

33:57.660 --> 33:59.696
The rum can only do so much.

33:59.780 --> 34:02.533
He's likely to come in and out
of consciousness with the pain.

34:02.950 --> 34:05.111
I can't do this without your help.

34:06.870 --> 34:07.950
Please.

34:14.840 --> 34:16.922
You're his colleague, Your Excellency.

34:17.300 --> 34:20.804
If he wakes, it will do him good
to see a friendly face to keep him calm.

34:21.810 --> 34:23.175
You have a kerchief?

34:23.930 --> 34:24.919
Uh, yes.

34:25.020 --> 34:27.181
Well, if he wakes,
let him bite down on it.

34:44.580 --> 34:45.865
Whoa, there, now.

34:51.210 --> 34:54.122
I, uh...
I'll borrow a horse onwards from here.

34:54.210 --> 34:55.837
Thank ye for aiding a fellow soldier.

34:55.920 --> 34:57.717
Is there a war I'm not aware of?

34:58.470 --> 35:00.847
Aye. Aye, there is, sir.

35:13.110 --> 35:14.099
Hold him steady.

35:28.830 --> 35:29.819
There.

35:38.510 --> 35:40.637
You must keep calm, Mr Fanning.

35:48.640 --> 35:51.643
Governor Tryon, talk to him.
Distract him from the pain.

35:54.110 --> 35:57.318
Now, if you lie still, Fanning,
when all this is over,

35:58.150 --> 36:00.778
I'll dip my hands into the treasury
and have a house built for you

36:01.200 --> 36:04.943
with the finest brick exterior
you've ever laid your eyes upon.

36:05.200 --> 36:09.034
Impenetrable as a fortress,
safe from those insurgent mobs.

36:09.120 --> 36:10.109
All right. Hold him.

36:22.470 --> 36:23.459
Well done, Governor.

36:23.550 --> 36:25.552
I must admit
that was all rather exciting.

36:26.930 --> 36:28.010
He, uh...

36:28.640 --> 36:30.221
He won't remember what I said, will he?

36:30.640 --> 36:32.642
Make way. Let me through.

36:38.030 --> 36:39.816
What hath hell wrought?

36:41.900 --> 36:44.061
I've just begun to close the opening.

36:45.070 --> 36:47.026
You've butchered him, madam.

36:47.240 --> 36:49.617
All he needed was tobacco smoke
up through the rear.

36:50.750 --> 36:51.956
No need of you.

36:52.620 --> 36:53.951
The lady has it in hand.

37:23.320 --> 37:25.356
Stop! Will you stop?

37:35.040 --> 37:36.701
Let's take our money back.

38:09.910 --> 38:10.945
Finished, madam?

38:14.540 --> 38:16.110
Thank you, gentlemen.

38:17.630 --> 38:19.029
I'll see him home.

38:19.920 --> 38:21.581
Believe you may have saved his life.

38:27.130 --> 38:28.461
I see now why your husband claims

38:28.550 --> 38:30.347
he cannot live without you
in the wilderness.

38:36.270 --> 38:38.306
You certainly left that
to the last moment.

38:40.610 --> 38:42.009
He dinna seem to notice.

38:45.190 --> 38:46.942
Did you manage to reach Murtagh in time?

38:47.490 --> 38:48.479
I hope so.

38:51.830 --> 38:52.865
Good evening.

38:53.620 --> 38:55.030
Oh, it's cold out.

38:55.250 --> 38:57.115
It's me, Fergus.

38:57.210 --> 38:58.416
The Governor knows of your plan

38:58.500 --> 38:59.956
and intends to have you arrested.

39:02.500 --> 39:03.626
Fergus?

39:04.880 --> 39:06.290
Is that you?

39:06.380 --> 39:09.884
Milord sent me to warn you.
Do not rob the coach.

39:21.860 --> 39:23.066
May I help you?

39:25.900 --> 39:27.106
Apologies, sir.

39:27.650 --> 39:29.561
We've had a bottle or two this evening.

39:30.610 --> 39:33.989
I thought you might tell us
if this is the road to Wilmington.

39:34.740 --> 39:35.820
Aye, it is.

39:37.790 --> 39:39.109
You must be on your way.

39:39.210 --> 39:41.531
It's not wise to linger
on these roads at night.

39:41.630 --> 39:44.121
Oh, well... We'll be doing just that.

39:44.210 --> 39:45.916
Be well, sir. Thanks.

39:46.010 --> 39:48.126
Appreciate it. Come on, come on.

39:48.220 --> 39:49.209
Up here.

39:49.300 --> 39:50.585
Have a good night.

39:54.390 --> 39:55.675
We've been found out.

39:56.640 --> 39:58.050
Come on. Clear out.

40:07.610 --> 40:09.316
You have a spy in your camp.

40:11.570 --> 40:12.980
I suppose I must.

40:15.830 --> 40:19.288
My godson couldn't be troubled
to come here and tell me himself?

40:19.370 --> 40:20.746
He is at the theatre.

40:22.710 --> 40:23.825
The theatre?

40:25.380 --> 40:26.369
Just as well.

40:26.800 --> 40:28.756
There's no other man I'd rather see.

40:36.560 --> 40:38.096
We should start looking for gems

40:38.180 --> 40:40.671
to get back through the stones
after we help your parents.

40:40.770 --> 40:41.805
Yeah.

40:43.520 --> 40:46.762
It's just so frustrating
not knowing the exact date of the fire.

40:47.570 --> 40:50.277
I know I have time,
I just don't know how much.

40:52.110 --> 40:53.691
I could kill that printer.

40:55.740 --> 40:58.368
When I met him,
I was tempted to tell him off, but...

40:58.450 --> 40:59.439
VVho?

40:59.950 --> 41:02.612
The printer who smudged the date.

41:03.330 --> 41:04.410
How did you know?

41:07.040 --> 41:08.086
Hmm?

41:09.960 --> 41:12.087
I just told you
about the obituary today.

41:13.180 --> 41:16.638
How could you have known about
the smudged date or who the printer was?

41:17.640 --> 41:18.675
Unless you...

41:23.100 --> 41:24.590
Unless you already knew.

41:30.320 --> 41:31.480
Don't be angry,

41:32.740 --> 41:33.855
but I did know.

41:35.200 --> 41:36.406
I found the same obituary.

41:40.620 --> 41:41.860
After I left?

41:42.910 --> 41:45.117
No. Before.

41:48.380 --> 41:50.336
- And you didn't tell me?
- I almost did.

41:51.420 --> 41:52.455
But...

41:54.050 --> 41:56.837
You were so happy when I told you
that your parents found each other.

41:56.930 --> 41:58.636
I couldn't bear making you sad again.

41:58.970 --> 42:02.633
You found out my mother died, and you
didn't think that I should know that?

42:02.730 --> 42:03.879
At first, I did.

42:04.770 --> 42:06.180
I wanted to tell ye.

42:06.770 --> 42:07.805
Bnanna,

42:09.770 --> 42:11.601
there was no point breaking your heart.

42:13.240 --> 42:15.276
- Even Fiona agreed...
- Fiona?

42:17.200 --> 42:19.191
You talked to Fiona about this?

42:20.410 --> 42:23.152
About my mother and time travel?

42:23.250 --> 42:24.956
That's how I found the obituary.

42:25.040 --> 42:27.110
Fiona had it, or her granny did.

42:27.210 --> 42:29.701
She was a caller for the dancers
at Craigh na Dun.

42:29.790 --> 42:31.621
Fiona already knew about time travel,

42:32.250 --> 42:34.298
and she agreed that
if I told you about the fire,

42:34.380 --> 42:35.665
it would do more harm than good.

42:35.760 --> 42:37.421
Oh, she did, did she?

42:39.090 --> 42:41.422
She's the one you consulted about this,
and not me?

42:42.220 --> 42:43.710
And then the two of you decided

42:43.810 --> 42:46.381
that I shouldn't know
that my own mother was dead?

42:46.480 --> 42:48.186
She was already dead.

42:49.360 --> 42:52.727
You knew she was dead.
She's been dead for 200 years.

42:52.820 --> 42:54.185
What could you do?

42:54.940 --> 42:55.941
This.

42:56.400 --> 42:58.027
Roger, I could do this.

43:00.870 --> 43:03.191
But you didn't want me to.

43:03.290 --> 43:06.532
Brianna, we have this gift,

43:06.620 --> 43:09.783
but we cannot be the arbiters
of who lives and who dies,

43:10.210 --> 43:11.871
or we'd save all our loved ones.

43:12.090 --> 43:14.126
That was my decision to make.

43:14.920 --> 43:17.047
I would never
have done that to you, Roger.

43:17.130 --> 43:19.428
How dare you take that choice
away from me?

43:19.510 --> 43:21.296
I didn't want to break your heart!

43:21.390 --> 43:24.006
No, you wanted me to be happy
so I'd marry you.

43:24.100 --> 43:26.477
Yes! Yes.

43:27.640 --> 43:29.801
Pardon me for wanting you to be my wife,

43:31.020 --> 43:33.397
which, by the way, you are now,

43:33.480 --> 43:35.027
so maybe it's time you listened to me.

43:35.190 --> 43:36.316
What?

43:36.400 --> 43:39.142
I'm your wife,
so now I have to do what you say?

43:39.240 --> 43:40.400
Is that how it's gonna be?

43:40.490 --> 43:42.276
You make all of my decisions for me

43:42.370 --> 43:44.235
so I don't have to worry
my pretty little head?

43:44.330 --> 43:45.786
You're twisting my words.

43:46.750 --> 43:48.490
I nearly died coming after you!

43:48.580 --> 43:51.413
- Well, I didn't ask you to come.
- Oh, that's right. You just left.

43:51.500 --> 43:52.740
You left without saying a word,

43:52.840 --> 43:56.458
just a note I was supposed
to receive a year later,

43:56.960 --> 43:59.622
after ye'd died or got stuck.

44:00.970 --> 44:03.347
- Maybe I should just go back.
- Maybe you should.

44:07.270 --> 44:08.339
Is that what you want?

44:09.640 --> 44:11.767
For me to leave
and return through the stones?

44:13.110 --> 44:15.351
Turns out Lizzie and I
do pretty well on our own.

44:15.480 --> 44:16.469
Bnanna,

44:17.780 --> 44:20.943
you told me about
your last words to your father,

44:21.200 --> 44:23.065
and how you've never forgiven yourself
for leaving him like that...

44:23.160 --> 44:25.902
Don't you dare
bring my father into this.

44:25.990 --> 44:27.992
It's the same thing. Can't you see that?

44:28.080 --> 44:30.150
Right when it matters,
you're pushing me away.

44:30.250 --> 44:32.662
Screw you! I was just a kid.

44:32.750 --> 44:34.627
Well, you know what? You still are.

44:35.630 --> 44:37.245
You're acting like a child.

44:40.550 --> 44:43.758
- Maybe this was a mistake.
- Fine.

44:44.260 --> 44:46.387
If you really believe that,
then you should go.

44:51.890 --> 44:53.642
Look me in the eye and tell me

44:54.650 --> 44:56.811
because if that's what you really want,

44:59.860 --> 45:00.895
I will go.

45:06.830 --> 45:08.286
No one's stopping you.

45:45.660 --> 45:47.651
The insurgents must have
received word of my plan.

45:48.120 --> 45:50.441
- Someone alerted them?
- ObVIously.

45:51.120 --> 45:54.908
I told both of you about it, as well as
Fanning and Colonel Washington,

45:55.710 --> 45:57.325
but you were all in my company.

45:58.840 --> 46:01.707
No. I saw him leave the play.

46:04.090 --> 46:06.832
_- Who?
- Colonel Washington, Your Excellency.

46:07.180 --> 46:08.169
I saw him and his wife

46:08.260 --> 46:10.467
putting on their coats
as I ran to fetch the surgeon.

46:12.770 --> 46:14.635
- The two of them?
- Yes.

46:15.100 --> 46:16.306
The two of them together.

46:17.100 --> 46:18.761
Never trust a Virginian.

46:20.520 --> 46:22.226
Washington's day will come.

47:13.700 --> 47:15.110
Losing your courage, man?

47:18.170 --> 47:20.957
I may have lost 20 shillings,
but I still have my soul.

47:21.420 --> 47:23.581
A soul is as rare
as hen's teeth around here.

47:24.710 --> 47:27.929
How about something with
a little more earthly value, then?

47:28.930 --> 47:31.501
You'll need a lot of luck
to pull this one off, Bonnet.

47:31.970 --> 47:33.176
Yes, I will.

47:39.520 --> 47:41.431
Blow on it, will ye, darling?

47:45.280 --> 47:47.066
Perhaps ye'll change my luck.

47:57.200 --> 47:58.246
Where did you get this?

47:59.790 --> 48:00.859
Why do you ask?

48:01.630 --> 48:04.087
- It looks like one my mother had.
- Does it now?

48:09.970 --> 48:11.119
Is she alive?

48:12.010 --> 48:14.001
It's bad luck to wear
the jewellery of the dead.

48:15.350 --> 48:17.716
I cannot say
I've noticed that effect myself,

48:18.430 --> 48:21.649
but I can assure you, your mother
was both alive and well when I left her.

48:23.310 --> 48:24.299
Where is she?

48:24.980 --> 48:26.186
Afraid I don't know.

48:26.980 --> 48:28.811
My time with the lady
was some while ago,

48:29.570 --> 48:30.559
though pleasant.

48:33.200 --> 48:34.827
But if you'd like to return it to her,

48:37.330 --> 48:39.116
perhaps an agreement could be reached.

48:40.790 --> 48:41.779
Fold.

48:42.120 --> 48:43.747
- You'll sell it to me?
- Come, now.

48:44.840 --> 48:46.546
I never haggle in public.

48:48.800 --> 48:50.370
This lot will learn my tricks.

49:00.640 --> 49:02.596
How much money do you want for it?

49:04.440 --> 49:05.475
I have enough money.

49:15.530 --> 49:16.827
But perhaps you could earn it.

49:18.790 --> 49:21.577
- I think you've mistaken me. I...
- No, I think you've mistaken me.

49:21.660 --> 49:23.616
No! Please, just let me go.
Please...

49:27.670 --> 49:29.911
- You want to play games, do you?
- No! No!

49:32.090 --> 49:33.250
Somebody!

49:37.140 --> 49:38.255
Someone, please!

49:40.100 --> 49:41.089
Two pairs.

49:41.180 --> 49:42.169
Fold.

49:42.270 --> 49:43.510
Get off of me!

49:44.020 --> 49:45.180
Queen high.

49:46.980 --> 49:48.356
Somebody help me!

49:50.320 --> 49:52.140
Please, somebody help me!

49:57.490 --> 49:58.570
A pair.

50:33.360 --> 50:34.896
I've had livelier rides.

50:38.990 --> 50:40.025
You know,

50:41.740 --> 50:43.492
I thought ye might've been a virgin,

50:46.460 --> 50:49.748
but that wasn't your first time, was it?

51:18.820 --> 51:20.526
Forgot something, didn't you?

51:27.370 --> 51:28.997
I pay for my pleasures.

51:30.000 --> 51:31.661
I'm an honest man for a pirate.

51:48.850 --> 51:50.397
If you find your mother,

51:51.350 --> 51:52.806
give her my regards.
