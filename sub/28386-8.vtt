WEBVTT

00:00.219 --> 00:01.620
<i>Previously, on "The Bold Type."</i>

00:01.651 --> 00:03.874
You worked for Pamela
Dolan as her assistant.

00:03.952 --> 00:05.918
Half my job was carrying
camera equipment.

00:05.954 --> 00:07.820
The other half was handing out NDAs.

00:07.856 --> 00:10.589
Would there be any chance
that you remember the models?

00:10.624 --> 00:11.891
It's my book tour itinerary.

00:11.926 --> 00:14.193
Twenty-three cities in eight weeks.

00:14.229 --> 00:15.693
That's a lot of cities.

00:16.175 --> 00:17.296
Hi, this is Sutton.

00:17.331 --> 00:18.597
That was Julian Grant.

00:18.632 --> 00:21.934
He just called to personally
welcome me into the seminar.

00:21.970 --> 00:24.403
- To Sutton.
- Maybe I was feeling stuck.

00:24.438 --> 00:26.052
- Because of me?
- Maybe.

00:26.087 --> 00:27.306
It is really hard to hear

00:27.342 --> 00:29.508
that you're, like,
the opposite of a muse for someone.

00:29.543 --> 00:31.944
This is the real me: Heartbroken.

00:31.980 --> 00:34.747
- So now what?
- Now I kiss you.

00:39.347 --> 00:40.819
_

00:45.593 --> 00:47.092
- What?
- I don't know.

00:47.127 --> 00:49.428
I hope I don't have a problem now.

00:50.272 --> 00:52.398
Huh?

00:53.048 --> 00:56.402
Well, we have an election
coming up, and I...

00:56.437 --> 01:00.672
just can't get out of bed.

01:00.708 --> 01:04.643
Yeah, I get it.
But, you know, I am paying you.

01:04.678 --> 01:07.546
- So...
- Really?

01:07.581 --> 01:09.014
I'm totally vulnerable right now,

01:09.049 --> 01:10.883
- and that's what you say?
- Yeah.

01:10.918 --> 01:12.885
- As my campaign manager.
- Oh, as your campaign manager.

01:12.920 --> 01:14.986
- Did I not mention that?
- No, you did leave that out.

01:15.022 --> 01:17.755
- Oh.
- But you're right,

01:17.791 --> 01:20.357
- you're right.
- Hey.

01:22.729 --> 01:26.096
Election's around the corner.
We got babies to kiss,

01:26.132 --> 01:30.100
hands to shake, un-woke to wake.

01:30.947 --> 01:32.303
Yeah.

01:32.453 --> 01:34.601
_

01:36.008 --> 01:37.708
Oh.

01:40.079 --> 01:43.180
So this is the first text
from Adena in how long?

01:43.215 --> 01:46.851
Five or six weeks? Okay, yes.

01:46.886 --> 01:48.719
After I sent Adena's stuff back,

01:48.755 --> 01:50.321
we were texting a little bit.

01:50.356 --> 01:53.458
You know, nothing major.
Just "Hi, how are you?"

01:53.493 --> 01:54.926
- You were "tingering."
- What?

01:54.961 --> 01:57.027
- Huh?
- Lingering in a relationship

01:57.063 --> 01:59.163
via text. I made it up.

01:59.198 --> 02:00.997
- Sorry, continue.
- Her text said

02:01.032 --> 02:02.599
"Would really love to see you."

02:02.634 --> 02:04.968
- What does that even mean?
- I don't know.

02:05.003 --> 02:08.705
Maybe it could mean
she'd really love to see you.

02:08.740 --> 02:12.308
- Naked.
- You know what's crazy is

02:12.344 --> 02:14.878
I used to fantasize about the moment

02:14.913 --> 02:16.746
that I would finally see Adena again.

02:16.782 --> 02:20.049
You know, like, what she'd say,
and then what I'd say.

02:20.085 --> 02:21.885
How you would have Michelle Obama arms

02:21.920 --> 02:24.988
- when you ran into her?
- Whatever, I just...

02:25.023 --> 02:28.758
I fell so hard so fast.

02:30.522 --> 02:33.096
Adena opened my eyes.

02:33.131 --> 02:36.332
She taught me things about myself,

02:36.368 --> 02:40.537
and she was...

02:40.572 --> 02:42.538
is incredible.

02:42.573 --> 02:44.407
- She is.
- We know.

02:44.442 --> 02:46.242
- Yeah.
- Which is why

02:46.277 --> 02:47.643
you have to text her back and say yes,

02:47.678 --> 02:49.912
you'll meet her tonight.

02:49.947 --> 02:54.083
Actually, that's why
I just said that I can't.

02:54.119 --> 02:55.918
- Really?
- Really.

02:55.953 --> 02:59.088
I need to move on,
and I just can't with this right now.

02:59.124 --> 03:00.390
What did you say? Let me see.

03:03.261 --> 03:04.860
"Work is so crazy, I can't.

03:04.896 --> 03:06.195
"I'll text when I come up for air.

03:06.231 --> 03:08.364
Plain smiley face." Great work.

03:08.400 --> 03:10.033
- Thank you.
- I just have one addition.

03:10.068 --> 03:11.567
Yeah, if you could just make one...

03:11.602 --> 03:13.602
- You know what?
- I was gonna say you should...

03:13.638 --> 03:15.471
Don't, you're actually touching it! Hey!

03:19.811 --> 03:22.978
Go on the record about Pamela Dolan?

03:23.013 --> 03:26.080
What, just ignore my nondisclosure?

03:26.115 --> 03:29.584
- That could cost me $40,000.
- We don't think it would.

03:29.619 --> 03:32.119
People are starting to see
NDAs for what they really are.

03:32.155 --> 03:34.556
Evidence of abuse.

03:34.591 --> 03:36.324
And we have a little more.

03:40.697 --> 03:43.465
- I'm a model.
- A model who came out here

03:43.500 --> 03:45.567
straight from Iowa at 16 years old,

03:45.602 --> 03:48.035
and was ordered by the "Pamela Dolan"

03:48.071 --> 03:50.938
to get into freezing ocean waters.

03:50.974 --> 03:53.742
You were in there so long
that you were hospitalized.

03:53.777 --> 03:57.178
That's not normal.

04:00.650 --> 04:05.587
Pamela is so powerful.
Who's going to believe me?

04:05.622 --> 04:07.789
Well, what if it wasn't just you?

04:07.824 --> 04:11.292
What if we got other women
to break their NDAs with you?

04:11.327 --> 04:13.394
Like who?

04:13.429 --> 04:17.031
Well, I'd need
to get them to agree first

04:17.065 --> 04:18.732
before I reveal their names to you,

04:18.767 --> 04:22.836
but I will call them,
and then I'll talk to you.

04:27.076 --> 04:29.277
Okay.

04:34.450 --> 04:38.286
So, some of you are taking to
design like a duck to water,

04:38.321 --> 04:40.955
and some of you, well, not yet.

04:42.625 --> 04:45.826
Look at it.
The stitching, it's impeccable,

04:45.861 --> 04:48.963
thereby fulfilling
the theme of the piece.

04:48.998 --> 04:51.331
Donnie, great job.

04:51.366 --> 04:54.267
So you win this class's Runway Prize.

04:54.303 --> 04:58.505
Now, everyone else,
there's always next class.

05:06.649 --> 05:09.149
- Hey, uh, Daphne, right?
- Yeah.

05:09.184 --> 05:10.617
I really liked your blouse.

05:10.653 --> 05:12.519
- Simple.
- Thanks.

05:12.555 --> 05:14.120
Actually, I really liked yours, too.

05:14.156 --> 05:17.023
Aw, thanks.
Julian Grant certainly didn't.

05:18.828 --> 05:20.861
Yeah, well.
that's because he was blinded

05:20.896 --> 05:22.663
by the $250-a-yard fabric

05:22.698 --> 05:25.031
and the Gucci-grade
sewing machine that made it.

05:27.000 --> 05:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here

05:34.797 --> 05:36.242
<i>The design class is really great,</i>

05:36.278 --> 05:37.844
but I honestly get the vibe

05:37.879 --> 05:39.112
that a lot of these other students

05:39.147 --> 05:40.813
don't even have day jobs.

05:40.849 --> 05:43.483
So they have plenty of time
for the assignments,

05:43.518 --> 05:45.785
unlike the hardest-working
assistant in fashion.

05:45.820 --> 05:48.054
Yeah, and a lot of them

05:48.090 --> 05:50.823
have professional quality
sewing machines, too.

05:50.859 --> 05:53.926
It's fine, I enjoy being
the underfunded underdog.

05:53.962 --> 05:55.976
That is why I like the Phillies.

05:56.011 --> 05:58.264
Yeah, I've been meaning to have a word
with you about that.

05:58.300 --> 06:01.567
See, you live in Manhattan now,
and we're Yankees fans.

06:01.603 --> 06:03.136
You are, I'm not.

06:05.273 --> 06:06.839
- Oh, I got it.
- It's okay.

06:06.875 --> 06:08.508
I can get my salad, and you can get your

06:08.543 --> 06:10.410
- carbonara-carpaccio.
- Sutton, you don't have to.

06:10.445 --> 06:11.544
- Let me get it.
- I'm Venmo-ing you right now.

06:12.780 --> 06:16.281
Done. Now you can get it.

06:16.317 --> 06:19.151
And all the air miles.

06:22.189 --> 06:24.689
Oh, Reynolds just posted a video.

06:24.725 --> 06:26.158
Oh, has he got his sleeves rolled up,

06:26.193 --> 06:27.426
- looking like he gives a shit?
- No.

06:27.461 --> 06:29.428
Actually, it's an ad about you.

06:31.232 --> 06:34.833
<i>Kat Edison claims she's a serious,
legitimate candidate.</i>

06:34.868 --> 06:36.835
<i>Well, this is the real Kat Edison,</i>

06:36.870 --> 06:40.039
<i>shown in all her unfiltered
social media posts.</i>

06:40.074 --> 06:44.510
<i>Shot, selfies, wild nights, tears.</i>

06:44.545 --> 06:47.112
This is the real me. Heartbroken.

06:47.148 --> 06:50.449
<i>Take her word for it,
this is the real Kat Edison.</i>

06:50.484 --> 06:54.253
<i>Paid for by the Committee
to Re-elect Lawrence Reynold.</i>

06:54.288 --> 06:57.455
Well, congratulations.
You're in politics now.

06:57.490 --> 06:58.789
Yeah.

07:01.127 --> 07:04.529
- You okay?
- It's weird to...

07:04.564 --> 07:06.464
Yeah, because that's not the real you.

07:06.499 --> 07:08.066
That's a distorted version of you

07:08.101 --> 07:09.667
spliced together for a hit piece.

07:09.702 --> 07:12.136
- Right?
- Right.

07:12.172 --> 07:16.240
Kat, seriously, do not worry about it.

07:17.510 --> 07:20.111
Okay. So what do we do?

07:20.146 --> 07:22.913
We hit back, but our way.

07:27.620 --> 07:30.354
<i>So Jacqueline Carlyle
is coming here now?</i>

07:30.390 --> 07:32.756
You might want to run a vacuum around.

07:32.792 --> 07:35.426
I did, twice.

07:35.462 --> 07:38.362
Look, so, um,
we're chasing a big story...

07:38.398 --> 07:41.031
Say no more. I will go out.

07:41.067 --> 07:43.366
Maybe do a little bit of light reading.

07:43.402 --> 07:46.036
- Ryan's book?
- Yeah.

07:46.072 --> 07:50.007
So what do you think?

07:50.042 --> 07:51.942
It's great. He's an evocative writer.

07:51.978 --> 07:55.312
And, well, you know.

07:55.347 --> 07:58.048
- What?
- Well, you read it, right?

07:58.084 --> 08:00.350
Of course I read it.
I got the first copy.

08:00.385 --> 08:02.620
I know it's fiction, but the hook-ups,

08:02.655 --> 08:04.655
the parties, the four-ways. Whew.

08:06.425 --> 08:08.792
That's my cue. See you at work.

08:11.697 --> 08:13.831
<i>- Hello?
- Hello, hi, is Jane here?</i>

08:13.866 --> 08:15.499
<i>She's coming.</i>

08:17.302 --> 08:20.070
If you all tell your stories
about Pamela together,

08:20.106 --> 08:21.738
then the "she said/she said"

08:21.773 --> 08:24.274
becomes "she said/they all said."

08:24.309 --> 08:26.843
Yeah, and we all get sued
for breaking our NDAs.

08:26.878 --> 08:28.378
We don't think that will happen.

08:28.413 --> 08:30.280
If multiple voices come forward,

08:30.315 --> 08:32.215
then Pamela's going to
be ducking for cover,

08:32.251 --> 08:33.716
trying to protecting her image.

08:33.751 --> 08:35.184
Speaking of image, what about ours?

08:35.220 --> 08:36.818
I mean, won't we get smeared?

08:36.855 --> 08:39.389
Yeah, I can hear it now.
A bunch of whiny models.

08:39.424 --> 08:41.323
Not if we break the story first,

08:41.360 --> 08:43.525
get ahead of the smear campaign.

08:43.561 --> 08:45.394
Jane will write the story,

08:45.429 --> 08:48.430
and we will do a top-shelf photo shoot.

08:48.466 --> 08:50.499
- With what photographer?
- Yeah, good ones

08:50.535 --> 08:51.934
might hesitate to shoot something

08:51.970 --> 08:54.436
that takes Pamela Dolan down.

08:54.472 --> 08:58.340
I promise... We will take care of you.

09:00.311 --> 09:03.546
- I'm in.
- Yeah, me too.

09:11.289 --> 09:13.923
Should we order dinner?

09:15.526 --> 09:17.326
Why don't you just say
what you really mean?

09:17.361 --> 09:20.796
- Do I want to work late?
- Oh, Red, you're working late.

09:20.831 --> 09:22.330
- I know.
- I'm just curious

09:22.365 --> 09:24.332
if you want to go hungry while we do it.

09:24.367 --> 09:26.467
Oliver, can I see you
in my office for a minute?

09:26.503 --> 09:27.936
Sure.

09:30.407 --> 09:32.874
Vegan tacos, and no mystery queso.

09:32.910 --> 09:35.476
Copy that.

09:35.512 --> 09:37.179
Hello, Jane.

09:39.083 --> 09:41.150
- We're doing it.
- The Pamela Dolan story?

09:42.152 --> 09:45.053
We're going to blow her abusive ass up
in the Fall issue.

09:45.089 --> 09:46.922
The best part is doing this piece

09:46.957 --> 09:49.591
is going to put Jacqueline
back on top where she belongs.

09:49.626 --> 09:52.126
- Jane, be careful.
- What?

09:52.161 --> 09:53.994
Your nipples are hard.

09:56.298 --> 09:57.431
You like it.

10:00.603 --> 10:03.270
So a photographer
who can capture emotion,

10:03.305 --> 10:04.772
but knows how to drink
a good cup of shut-up.

10:04.807 --> 10:06.573
We definitely need discretion.

10:06.609 --> 10:08.308
That's going to be tough.
It's a small community.

10:08.344 --> 10:10.410
They share lighting and grips, and...

10:10.446 --> 10:11.545
Okay, let's stop there.

10:12.815 --> 10:14.314
So we go outside the community,

10:14.350 --> 10:16.316
but it just has to be
someone that's good.

10:16.352 --> 10:17.818
Okay.

10:17.854 --> 10:20.287
Well, here's one. Adena El-Amin.

10:20.322 --> 10:23.290
Um, her agent emailed me.
I think she lives in Paris,

10:23.325 --> 10:25.191
but she's here for a gallery opening.

10:25.227 --> 10:29.829
- That's Kat's ex, right?
- Yes.

10:29.865 --> 10:33.066
And as I recall, Adena's very talented.

10:33.101 --> 10:34.868
Gets political, and she shot

10:34.903 --> 10:36.535
our body positivity piece, right?

10:37.839 --> 10:40.606
- She did.
- Well.

10:40.642 --> 10:43.143
Would she be good for this?

10:43.178 --> 10:44.677
Jane?

10:44.712 --> 10:46.746
Honestly...

10:50.318 --> 10:52.819
Yeah, yeah. She would be perfect.

10:59.212 --> 11:00.913
And as soon as Oliver said it,

11:00.948 --> 11:04.282
I knew that Adena kind
of was perfect for it.

11:04.318 --> 11:06.652
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

11:06.687 --> 11:09.220
I mean, if Adena's perfect for it,
then you should use her.

11:09.256 --> 11:11.657
And if I'm going move on,
I got to move on.

11:13.427 --> 11:16.161
I should go because Tia's
organized for a reporter

11:16.196 --> 11:17.996
from "NY14" to do a piece on me.

11:18.031 --> 11:19.731
She said it was better to show that I am

11:19.767 --> 11:22.501
a female, kickass force of
nature than to, you know,

11:22.536 --> 11:24.269
stoop to their level
and do a negative ad.

11:24.304 --> 11:27.505
Ah, I'm Sutton Brady,
and I approve this message.

11:27.540 --> 11:31.977
- Great, see you guys later.
- Okay.

11:32.012 --> 11:35.447
And, hey, Jane. It's really okay.

11:35.482 --> 11:37.548
You should use Adena. I'm fine.

11:47.861 --> 11:51.463
I know that we should leave,
but I just can't.

11:58.737 --> 12:02.373
Well, that dream died fast.

12:04.618 --> 12:05.909
Bye.

12:15.354 --> 12:17.021
- Hey, you busy?
- I thought I was busy,

12:17.056 --> 12:19.156
and then Oliver gave me
a shoot to style,

12:19.191 --> 12:21.191
and I'm also working on my
design assignment for class,

12:21.227 --> 12:22.626
so now, I'm really busy.

12:22.661 --> 12:24.328
This is going to be a jacket someday.

12:24.363 --> 12:27.031
Wow, so quick fashion-related questions

12:27.066 --> 12:29.133
since you are an expert.

12:29.168 --> 12:31.467
There's this up and coming
young designer.

12:31.503 --> 12:33.136
A real shooting star

12:33.171 --> 12:36.339
who's in need of a
high-end sewing machine.

12:36.374 --> 12:40.143
I'm just wondering,
will this model do the trick?

12:40.178 --> 12:43.413
- Oh, my God, it's beautiful.
- Right?

12:43.448 --> 12:45.548
- You want to buy this for me?
- For us.

12:47.118 --> 12:50.486
- It's $2,500!
- It makes 27 different kinds

12:50.522 --> 12:53.156
of buttonholes, so that's a deal.

12:53.191 --> 12:55.158
You know,
I actually have a plan in place

12:55.193 --> 12:56.926
- to buy a new one.
- What?

12:56.961 --> 12:58.494
Yeah, I'm cutting back on coffee

12:58.530 --> 12:59.828
and also ride shares.

12:59.864 --> 13:01.297
Sutton, that could take years.

13:01.332 --> 13:03.032
Don't you need this for your class now?

13:03.068 --> 13:05.400
Nah, I'm going to bring in
my old sewing machine

13:05.436 --> 13:09.204
and use the simple stitch
as part of my signature design.

13:09.239 --> 13:10.905
I can't believe you don't want this.

13:10.941 --> 13:13.241
Well, believe it, babe.

13:14.678 --> 13:17.212
- I have to get back to work.
- Oh.

13:33.230 --> 13:36.264
Uh, Jane?

13:36.300 --> 13:38.600
Adena, hi.

13:40.904 --> 13:44.271
- You look great.
- Thanks, you too.

13:47.176 --> 13:50.211
- Uh, do you want a coffee?
- No, no, no.

13:50.246 --> 13:53.681
- I'm good, thank you.
- So how long are you in town?

13:53.717 --> 13:55.650
Uh, three weeks.

13:55.685 --> 13:58.920
I have a gallery opening
in Chelsea next week,

13:58.955 --> 14:01.689
and then a few to scout.

14:01.725 --> 14:05.559
Possible locations for
a new multimedia series.

14:05.595 --> 14:10.364
- Wow, you're really busy.
- I am, yeah.

14:10.399 --> 14:13.934
And this shoot seems very important.

14:13.969 --> 14:16.970
The truth is, as soon as I heard
your name come up,

14:17.006 --> 14:19.239
I knew you were perfect for it,

14:19.274 --> 14:22.175
which was challenging for me,
because of...

14:22.210 --> 14:24.911
- Kat.
- Yeah.

14:24.947 --> 14:29.215
But I spoke with her about it,
and she's fine with it.

14:31.520 --> 14:34.521
How is Kat now?

14:34.556 --> 14:36.857
She's good, she's really good.

14:36.892 --> 14:40.961
Okay. I know she's been busy.

14:40.996 --> 14:42.963
We haven't reconnected yet.

14:42.998 --> 14:45.498
Yeah, and "busy" is an understatement.

14:45.534 --> 14:46.967
I mean, she's killing it at work.

14:47.002 --> 14:48.935
She's running for city council.

14:48.971 --> 14:52.772
- She's kind of seeing someone.
- Oh.

14:54.509 --> 14:59.646
Well, good.
I'm... I'm happy to hear that.

14:59.681 --> 15:03.916
- I want her to be happy, Jane.
- She is happy.

15:06.887 --> 15:10.822
So, um, we're shooting
these women at "Scarlet."

15:10.857 --> 15:13.325
Yes, I think it's safer that way.

15:13.360 --> 15:16.961
Okay, I'd love to see
the backdrops, if possible.

15:19.466 --> 15:21.166
Yeah, most of my job involves

15:21.202 --> 15:23.635
interacting with 6
million people online.

15:23.671 --> 15:25.870
And that will help you
represent District One?

15:25.906 --> 15:28.840
Mm-hmm, yeah, I listen,
I hear the consensus,

15:28.875 --> 15:30.742
and take appropriate action.

15:30.777 --> 15:32.010
I think those will be useful skills

15:32.045 --> 15:33.778
when elected to City Council.

15:37.050 --> 15:38.883
- I think we got it.
- Of course you got it.

15:38.919 --> 15:41.186
She is it. Thank you so much.

15:41.221 --> 15:43.221
We should probably clear out.
It's still a place of business.

15:43.256 --> 15:46.224
- All the best.
- Thank you.

15:46.259 --> 15:47.992
- Hey, this was a good idea.
- Yeah.

15:48.028 --> 15:50.128
- Not going negative in response?
- Yeah.

15:50.163 --> 15:52.530
Showing me in the workplace,
letting people know

15:52.565 --> 15:54.032
that I can handle a leadership role.

15:54.067 --> 15:55.566
Yeah, it's very smart.

15:55.602 --> 15:58.269
You have too much to offer
to go negative.

16:03.910 --> 16:07.511
- Adena, hi.
- Kat, hi.

16:09.081 --> 16:12.816
Your hair. I love it.

16:12.852 --> 16:15.152
Oh, thanks.

16:15.187 --> 16:18.256
This is Tia. She's my campaign manager.

16:18.291 --> 16:20.558
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

16:20.593 --> 16:23.060
- This is Adena.
- Yeah, I've seen photos.

16:23.095 --> 16:25.062
I'm going to catch up with the guys,

16:25.097 --> 16:27.365
and get in on the edit if I can,
so I'll see you later.

16:27.400 --> 16:29.099
Okay.

16:31.537 --> 16:35.473
So, I guess you've been pretty busy.

16:35.508 --> 16:37.408
- Yeah.
- You probably haven't

16:37.443 --> 16:41.178
- put down your phone in months.
- Nope.

16:41.213 --> 16:43.247
Well, running for City Council.

16:43.282 --> 16:46.516
- It's... it's very impressive.
- Thanks.

16:46.551 --> 16:49.319
Yeah, just "Vote for Kat."

16:49.354 --> 16:53.157
That'll... that's got to be better.

16:53.192 --> 16:56.660
- You'll be great.
- Thank you.

16:59.698 --> 17:01.464
- Anyway...
- Yeah, we should...

17:01.500 --> 17:05.301
- Yeah, it was good to see you.
- Yeah, you too.

17:09.441 --> 17:12.810
So you have a gallery show coming up?

17:12.845 --> 17:15.944
Yeah, yeah, you should come.

17:15.980 --> 17:19.147
- If you can.
- Yeah, maybe.

17:20.785 --> 17:23.986
- Bye.
- See you.

17:24.021 --> 17:25.887
I'm sorry.

17:37.556 --> 17:39.216
- Damn it.
- What happened?

17:40.646 --> 17:43.396
We ran into Adena. Kat, I'm so sorry.

17:43.432 --> 17:45.131
I thought that you were
out getting interviewed.

17:45.166 --> 17:48.668
Yeah, it's fine.
I just didn't expect, you know,

17:48.704 --> 17:50.637
seeing her to hurt this much,
that's all.

17:50.672 --> 17:53.005
Why didn't you expect it?

17:53.041 --> 17:57.944
I just really thought I was over her.

17:57.979 --> 18:01.615
- Well, that was dumb.
- Kat, Adena's your first.

18:01.650 --> 18:03.940
You'll get over her.
It'll just take time.

18:03.975 --> 18:06.553
Yeah, Jane's right.
Firsts are a totally different thing.

18:06.588 --> 18:09.122
I mean, the way you feel about Adena,

18:09.157 --> 18:12.659
I felt about Billy,
who had an "Ass, gas, or grass,

18:12.694 --> 18:15.327
no one rides for free" bumper sticker.

18:17.798 --> 18:20.198
- He's the one that got away.
- Yeah.

18:22.670 --> 18:24.303
What?

18:26.540 --> 18:27.873
I don't know, it's just...

18:27.908 --> 18:29.375
I mean, you broke up with Richard,

18:29.410 --> 18:32.010
- and then you went back, right?
- Yeah.

18:32.045 --> 18:34.179
So, yeah, I mean, Adena is my first,

18:34.214 --> 18:37.048
but what if she's my Richard?

18:39.520 --> 18:41.853
Maybe that's why
seeing her hurt so much.

18:43.624 --> 18:47.125
Oh, my God. This sucks.

18:47.161 --> 18:50.495
See, this is why I didn't do
relationships for so long.

18:50.530 --> 18:52.029
Screwing around is so much easier.

18:52.064 --> 18:55.032
Yeah, it's a really, really good option.

18:57.771 --> 19:03.140
- Hey, hang in there.
- You're going to be okay.

19:26.898 --> 19:29.299
- Hey.
- Hi.

19:29.335 --> 19:31.457
- It's a sewing machine.
- It is.

19:31.492 --> 19:32.769
And I know I should've
told you about it when

19:32.805 --> 19:34.938
I showed you the picture,
but you were just so against it.

19:34.973 --> 19:37.441
- I still am.
- Which is why

19:37.476 --> 19:40.210
I drew up a P&L document

19:40.245 --> 19:43.513
detailing our liabilities and assets.

19:43.549 --> 19:45.415
I included everything from rent

19:45.451 --> 19:47.417
to the fact that you drink
most of the orange juice.

19:47.453 --> 19:49.986
That's 23.75 in your column.

19:50.021 --> 19:51.988
But you did start to make
the coffee in the morning,

19:52.023 --> 19:55.458
so that saves me $43 in lattes.

19:55.493 --> 19:57.125
And everything pretty much evens out

19:57.161 --> 20:01.864
except for the 100 grand
you saved me in legal fees,

20:01.899 --> 20:03.466
because I would have married Jessica

20:03.501 --> 20:05.334
and then gotten a divorce
if you hadn't come along.

20:05.370 --> 20:08.904
So, you know,
just trying to keep everything fair.

20:08.939 --> 20:14.209
That is really something.

20:14.245 --> 20:16.679
But I still can't accept it.

20:18.383 --> 20:22.017
Sutton, I don't know what to say.

20:22.661 --> 20:24.453
Don't say anything. Just hug me,

20:24.489 --> 20:26.489
and tell me that you
get how hard this is.

20:26.524 --> 20:28.491
But that's just it. I don't get it.

20:28.526 --> 20:31.626
- Why won't you let me do this?
- Why are you so desperate

20:31.661 --> 20:34.429
to buy me a $2,500 sewing machine?

20:34.464 --> 20:36.698
I'm not desperate.
I'm just trying to help.

20:36.733 --> 20:38.901
- I don't want help.
- And I don't know why.

20:38.936 --> 20:41.703
I get that you don't want my
housekeeper to do your laundry,

20:41.738 --> 20:44.039
but splitting every single dinner check,

20:44.074 --> 20:46.674
and making sure that you pay
your part of the groceries,

20:46.710 --> 20:50.012
and not letting me buy you a gift?

20:50.047 --> 20:52.314
It doesn't feel like you're
just doing your part.

20:52.349 --> 20:53.815
It feels like you're keeping me at bay.

21:04.561 --> 21:07.395
- The timing wasn't great.
- Yeah.

21:07.431 --> 21:11.599
That was some really bad
elevator luck, huh?

21:13.904 --> 21:16.504
- Oh, you mean...
- Yeah.

21:16.540 --> 21:21.876
Well, you know, what happened
between us was big for me.

21:21.912 --> 21:23.377
Yeah, me, too.

21:25.381 --> 21:28.817
But, you know,
woman plans and God laughs, right?

21:28.852 --> 21:33.821
Yeah, but why didn't you just
tell me Adena was back in town?

21:33.856 --> 21:38.192
Because things are great.
We're great, right?

21:38.227 --> 21:40.027
- Yeah.
- I just didn't want it

21:40.063 --> 21:44.731
- to be a thing.
- So then was it a thing?

21:46.802 --> 21:50.304
I've never had an ex before,

21:50.340 --> 21:53.540
so I'm kind of still figuring it out,

21:53.576 --> 21:59.046
and I assume that it's supposed
to feel weird and awkward

21:59.082 --> 22:02.683
running into someone in your work place

22:02.718 --> 22:04.852
with your new boo.

22:04.887 --> 22:08.121
- Who is your campaign manager.
- Yeah.

22:08.156 --> 22:12.325
But the most important thing is that

22:12.361 --> 22:15.895
Adena and I didn't work. We're done.

22:15.930 --> 22:18.598
Okay, well, then, uh...

22:18.633 --> 22:21.134
I just have one question.

22:21.169 --> 22:24.104
Is Adena a voter in our district?

22:24.139 --> 22:26.006
- No.
- Then I don't want to

22:26.041 --> 22:27.540
talk about her anymore.

22:27.575 --> 22:29.775
- Cool?
- Okay.

22:31.646 --> 22:34.914
"We're beasts. Procreation machines

22:34.949 --> 22:37.250
"put on the planet to make more beasts,

22:37.285 --> 22:39.452
"and we try to tie that
to emotion and love,

22:39.488 --> 22:42.388
"because we're optimists,
but it's horseshit.

22:42.423 --> 22:45.491
And ultimately, it's doomed to fail."

22:46.071 --> 22:48.561
- Romantic.
- Okay, it's also fiction,

22:48.596 --> 22:51.263
and if I could get a hold of Ryan,

22:51.298 --> 22:54.299
I would have him explain that to you.

22:54.335 --> 22:55.401
Mm.

22:57.672 --> 22:59.238
If I have to leave again,

22:59.273 --> 23:00.540
we're going to have to discuss my rent.

23:03.845 --> 23:05.044
- Hello.
- Hi.

23:05.079 --> 23:07.479
I'm here to stitch and bitch.

23:07.515 --> 23:09.615
And I think I should still have a key.

23:09.651 --> 23:12.484
- What are you doing here?
- Whatever I want.

23:13.128 --> 23:15.120
- Wow.
- You know, and Richard,

23:15.156 --> 23:17.822
he just wants to pay for rent,
and pay for dinner,

23:17.858 --> 23:20.592
- and pay for a sewing machine.
- What an asshole.

23:20.627 --> 23:22.327
I want to pay for my own stuff.

23:22.363 --> 23:24.463
And where were you two when I was broke

23:24.498 --> 23:27.266
- buying sushi on first dates?
- Buying our own sushi.

23:27.301 --> 23:29.801
- Ah, boom!
- Touché.

23:29.836 --> 23:32.771
But, Sutton,
you and Richard live together.

23:32.806 --> 23:34.406
Can't he share with the person he loves?

23:34.442 --> 23:35.974
I mean, what's wrong with that?

23:36.009 --> 23:38.510
It just makes me feel
bought and paid for.

23:38.546 --> 23:40.112
Are you?

23:41.815 --> 23:43.848
- No.
- So if it's just

23:43.884 --> 23:46.985
how you're feeling, isn't that on you?

23:49.656 --> 23:52.691
You know what, also,
I tried your fancy coffee.

23:52.726 --> 23:54.525
It's...

23:54.561 --> 23:56.027
It's not that good. It's not that great.

23:56.063 --> 23:58.830
- It's pretty bad.
- Look, I get it.

23:58.865 --> 24:00.665
I am simultaneously

24:00.701 --> 24:03.101
Jeff the molester and Ask Alex.

24:03.136 --> 24:05.503
Well, let me ask you a question,
"Jeff-lex."

24:05.538 --> 24:07.505
Ooh, whoa, too soon.

24:07.540 --> 24:09.574
If you were dating
a woman who was rich...

24:09.610 --> 24:11.109
Mm-hmm.

24:11.144 --> 24:12.877
...would you let her pay for everything?

24:12.913 --> 24:16.180
Whoo, I mean, that would be hard for me.

24:16.216 --> 24:18.883
And it would hurt my ego a little.

24:18.919 --> 24:24.822
But yeah, if it made her happy.
Um, but this isn't about me.

24:24.857 --> 24:28.892
The question is what works
best for you and Richard?

24:38.938 --> 24:41.739
Uh, no scrims, please.

24:41.774 --> 24:44.608
It should feel like
sunlight exposing truth.

24:44.644 --> 24:48.578
- Just raw and revealing.
- Okay.

24:48.614 --> 24:51.581
I think we have the right
photographer in Adena.

24:51.617 --> 24:53.517
- Anything else?
- No, we're good.

24:53.552 --> 24:55.418
And there's still a lot to do upstairs.

24:55.454 --> 24:57.954
- Thanks, Sutton.
- Yes, thank you.

25:00.459 --> 25:04.594
So, I think if we just move that...

25:04.630 --> 25:08.097
- Jane, is everything okay?
- No.

25:08.133 --> 25:10.066
Ingrid just got a phone call.

25:10.101 --> 25:12.302
Pamela Dolan's lawyers
are threatening to sue.

25:12.337 --> 25:14.538
Oh, the hack.

25:14.573 --> 25:17.106
They got a hold of that email
with the recording you sent me.

25:19.211 --> 25:21.010
I think they're going to back out.

25:28.761 --> 25:31.094
<i>Ladies, I can empathize.</i>

25:31.129 --> 25:34.064
I was also the victim of abuse.

25:34.099 --> 25:37.233
The circumstances were different,

25:37.269 --> 25:42.738
but like all of you,
I lived with my secret.

25:42.774 --> 25:46.042
I thought by keeping it,
I was in control.

25:46.078 --> 25:51.114
But then, I realized
that what I was actually doing

25:51.149 --> 25:57.287
was surrendering my power.
My power to help other women.

25:57.322 --> 26:03.993
You ladies are all so much
more powerful than you realize.

26:05.797 --> 26:11.100
Don't let Pamela Dolan or
anyone take that from you.

26:14.806 --> 26:18.474
- That was amazing.
- Yeah.

26:18.509 --> 26:21.777
I could've used a Jacqueline in my life.

26:21.813 --> 26:24.246
Just having someone like her to talk to.

26:24.281 --> 26:28.117
I probably could have avoided
some pretty big mistakes.

26:32.123 --> 26:34.090
- Are you talking about...
- We should get to it

26:34.125 --> 26:37.159
before we miss the moment.

27:10.493 --> 27:12.794
Hey.

27:12.829 --> 27:16.397
Um, I just want to say thank you.

27:16.432 --> 27:20.834
Thank you for hiring me, Jane.

27:20.870 --> 27:23.037
It's stories like this
that change the world,

27:23.072 --> 27:26.974
make it a better place
for the women after us.

27:29.879 --> 27:36.150
Before, when you were talking
about big mistakes,

27:36.185 --> 27:39.053
what were you talking about?

27:39.088 --> 27:42.555
Well, I was talking
about a lot of things.

27:42.590 --> 27:44.456
Was one of them Kat?

27:47.261 --> 27:49.395
Yes.

27:49.430 --> 27:52.231
Why did you leave her in Paris?

27:59.074 --> 28:01.674
That's a-a good question.

28:05.046 --> 28:08.881
I was hoping I could
discuss it with her.

28:08.917 --> 28:12.885
She was really hurt and confused.

28:12.921 --> 28:15.254
She felt like she was stifling you.

28:15.289 --> 28:19.424
- Like she wasn't inspiring.
- I know.

28:19.459 --> 28:23.328
But that's not the truth.

28:23.363 --> 28:26.898
You know, I was confused, too.

28:26.934 --> 28:32.137
I was living in her house.
I couldn't travel anywhere.

28:32.172 --> 28:35.273
I wasn't making any money
of my own for the first time.

28:35.308 --> 28:38.777
That was really hard for me.

28:38.812 --> 28:41.579
And I blamed her.

28:41.615 --> 28:44.182
I made a mistake.

28:45.819 --> 28:50.254
But it doesn't matter now. She's happy.

28:50.289 --> 28:54.191
And, um, she's seeing someone.

28:57.596 --> 29:01.966
You know, thank you
for the opportunity, Jane.

29:02.001 --> 29:04.802
I really hope the photos do these women

29:04.837 --> 29:08.572
and, of course, your story justice.

29:08.607 --> 29:11.408
- I have to finish up.
- Yeah.

29:31.496 --> 29:35.765
Yes, go! Come on, you little bitch!

29:35.801 --> 29:37.110
- How's it going?
- It's going.

29:37.169 --> 29:39.769
Cool, I just had
a conversation with Adena,

29:39.805 --> 29:41.104
and I need to talk to somebody,

29:41.139 --> 29:42.373
because I don't know what to do.

29:42.440 --> 29:43.779
Yeah, don't tell me. I don't have time.

29:43.809 --> 29:46.109
- I don't want to know.
- Adena just told me that

29:46.144 --> 29:47.877
what happened in Paris was a mistake.

29:48.914 --> 29:50.146
- What?
- I don't think

29:50.181 --> 29:52.115
- she's over Kat.
- Oh, my God.

29:52.150 --> 29:53.416
What do we do? Do we tell her?

29:53.451 --> 29:54.985
- I don't know.
- You saw Kat.

29:55.020 --> 29:56.919
- She's not over Adena.
- I know.

29:56.954 --> 29:59.021
But, I mean,
I don't want to blow things up

29:59.056 --> 30:00.990
with her and Tia. They seem so great.

30:01.025 --> 30:03.325
But what if Adena is Kat's Richard?

30:03.360 --> 30:05.694
I know he and I are in a bumpy
spot right now, but still,

30:05.730 --> 30:07.496
I would want to know. Wouldn't you?

30:07.531 --> 30:09.898
- Yeah.
- Ladies.

30:09.934 --> 30:12.267
Come see what we have wrought.

30:12.302 --> 30:13.669
I'll deal with you later.

30:16.340 --> 30:18.573
These are powerful.

30:18.609 --> 30:20.976
You really captured their spirit, Adena.

30:21.012 --> 30:25.280
Thank you. It was a real honor.

30:25.315 --> 30:27.249
And we can worship beauty, even money,

30:27.284 --> 30:31.119
but no one should ever
have to suffer abuse.

30:32.756 --> 30:34.589
Oh, please, Red.
I treat you like a Fabergé egg.

30:36.193 --> 30:39.161
Um, Jane,
can I talk to you for a second?

30:39.196 --> 30:40.995
Mm-hmm.

30:41.031 --> 30:43.331
You need to finish up
their written profiles quickly,

30:43.367 --> 30:44.699
because now that Pamela
Dolan is on the trail,

30:44.734 --> 30:46.368
we need to move up our timeline,

30:46.403 --> 30:48.203
get our ducks in a row,
because we are going to

30:48.238 --> 30:49.937
bring Pamela in here, we're going to

30:49.973 --> 30:51.939
confront her with this,
and get a statement.

30:51.975 --> 30:56.478
Wow, um, okay.

30:56.513 --> 30:59.413
- Here we go.
- Yes, here we go.

30:59.448 --> 31:01.115
All right.

31:03.419 --> 31:05.987
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, yeah, no.

31:06.022 --> 31:09.924
- It's just... it's a big day.
- Yeah.

31:13.596 --> 31:15.429
Do we tell her?

31:23.106 --> 31:25.372
Look at them. I think we have to.

31:32.815 --> 31:35.916
Hey, what's up? Was the shoot okay?

31:35.951 --> 31:37.751
Uh, yeah. Adena was amazing.

31:37.786 --> 31:39.853
Okay. I mean, I'm not surprised,

31:39.888 --> 31:43.056
so what's up?

31:43.092 --> 31:48.929
Well, Adena talked to Jane about you

31:48.964 --> 31:51.031
and what happened in Paris.

31:53.035 --> 31:56.270
Oh. What did she say?

31:56.305 --> 32:01.041
She said what happened
in Paris was a mistake.

32:01.076 --> 32:03.711
I'm not even sure she understands it,

32:03.746 --> 32:08.081
but I don't think she's over you, Kat.

32:10.185 --> 32:12.052
Uh...

32:15.090 --> 32:17.390
- Okay.
- I'm sorry, it's just, like,

32:17.425 --> 32:18.591
with everything you were saying...

32:18.627 --> 32:19.926
Yeah, we just... I mean,

32:19.962 --> 32:22.162
we thought that you should know,

32:22.197 --> 32:25.165
even if all you get
out of it is closure.

32:34.650 --> 32:37.653
Oh, this asymmetrical one
showed some imagination.

32:37.659 --> 32:40.492
And the sleeve cuts are innovative.

32:40.527 --> 32:43.395
Uh, I ran out of fabric.

32:43.430 --> 32:46.165
Necessity, the mother of invention.

32:46.200 --> 32:48.000
Ah, which brings us

32:48.035 --> 32:52.872
to the primitive stitching on
this women's tuxedo jacket.

32:52.907 --> 32:56.075
Look at that. Ironic and witty.

32:56.110 --> 33:01.413
So tonight's Runway
Prize goes to Sutton.

33:01.448 --> 33:03.983
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

33:04.018 --> 33:07.352
Keep working hard. Here's why.

33:07.388 --> 33:08.988
As some of you may already know,

33:09.023 --> 33:11.222
I'm rolling out my spring line soon,

33:11.258 --> 33:13.258
and as part of that fashion show,

33:13.293 --> 33:15.459
this class is going to
do a little pre-show.

33:15.495 --> 33:16.861
You'll show three to four looks each.

33:16.897 --> 33:18.362
Buyers will be there.

33:18.398 --> 33:20.698
So if you want to jumpstart your career,

33:20.733 --> 33:24.435
that's where you could do it.
So that's it for tonight.

33:29.760 --> 33:32.193
Look at you, and I knew you when...

33:32.228 --> 33:33.327
Oh, please.

33:34.698 --> 33:38.599
Oh, uh, sorry. Hey, babe, just one sec.

33:38.635 --> 33:40.301
Um, it's my boyfriend.

33:40.336 --> 33:41.803
He's just going to want
to know what Julian said.

33:41.838 --> 33:43.404
He was up all night with me helping me.

33:43.439 --> 33:46.274
- Oh, he helped you sew?
- Um, no.

33:46.309 --> 33:50.411
More like helped with the baby,
fed me-type things.

33:50.446 --> 33:51.912
Oh, sorry.

33:51.947 --> 33:55.916
Hey, you will never guess what he said.

33:55.951 --> 33:58.653
He called it innovative.

33:59.376 --> 34:01.088
Yeah.

34:01.123 --> 34:04.325
No, babe,
I couldn't have done it without you.

34:04.360 --> 34:08.462
What, no, don't do that.
Just wait for me.

34:08.498 --> 34:10.697
Okay, well, I'm going to be home soon.

34:10.733 --> 34:12.333
Bye.

34:18.039 --> 34:21.007
_

34:22.042 --> 34:23.784
_

34:27.616 --> 34:30.483
_

34:40.495 --> 34:43.161
You okay?

34:43.197 --> 34:45.398
Yeah.

34:48.069 --> 34:51.870
- Gustave Flaubert.
- What?

34:51.905 --> 34:54.706
Gustave Flaubert.
He wrote "Madame Bovary."

34:54.742 --> 34:57.074
I was an English major.

34:57.110 --> 34:59.144
It's this brilliant dive
inside of the mind

34:59.179 --> 35:01.280
of a young French peasant woman

35:01.315 --> 35:03.716
written by a rich city dude.

35:03.751 --> 35:05.817
I still have so much to learn about you.

35:05.853 --> 35:09.221
The point is, maybe being a good writer

35:09.257 --> 35:11.890
is the ability to step
outside of yourself.

35:11.925 --> 35:14.893
Write from a point of view
that's not yours at all,

35:14.928 --> 35:18.530
which Ryan does well.
I think I was just jealous.

35:18.566 --> 35:20.031
Well, you shouldn't be.

35:20.067 --> 35:22.568
You are also a great writer, "Jeff-lex."

35:22.603 --> 35:24.102
Still too soon.

35:25.539 --> 35:27.239
Yeah, no, you're right.

35:27.275 --> 35:29.507
It's just... since Ryan's been gone,

35:29.542 --> 35:32.110
it's been really hard for us to connect.

35:35.415 --> 35:38.049
Also, didn't Madame Bovary
have an affair?

35:39.719 --> 35:41.386
I was also an English major.

35:44.158 --> 35:45.857
That wasn't my point.

35:48.595 --> 35:50.295
But, yeah, she did.

35:52.277 --> 35:56.367
Yeah, so it's "Kat with a K
on Election Day."

35:56.403 --> 36:01.106
Yeah, we think it's cute, too.
All right, thanks, bye.

36:01.141 --> 36:05.476
Okay, you ready
to record some robo-calls?

36:05.512 --> 36:07.077
- Robo-calls.
- Uh-huh.

36:07.113 --> 36:10.815
Yeah. "Are you a voter?"

36:12.919 --> 36:15.085
- That was lame.
- We have time.

36:15.121 --> 36:17.888
- It'll get there.
- Yeah.

36:17.924 --> 36:20.458
Oh, hey, I think I'm going
to have to go home tonight.

36:20.493 --> 36:22.126
The next couple days
are going to be insane,

36:22.161 --> 36:23.894
and if I don't water my plants,

36:23.930 --> 36:26.163
I will officially be a plant murderer

36:26.199 --> 36:27.799
and I cannot have another

36:27.834 --> 36:29.767
Election Day massacre on my hands.

36:29.803 --> 36:32.804
- I do this every year.
- Yeah, I get it.

36:32.839 --> 36:34.171
Cool, thanks.

36:36.676 --> 36:40.611
Hey, you know what I adore about you?

36:40.647 --> 36:44.248
It's the fact that you
make this and us...

36:44.283 --> 36:48.585
it's just... it's easy.

36:48.620 --> 36:51.889
- It's great.
- Thanks, babe.

36:54.526 --> 36:57.061
Where is this thing?
I did so many drafts.

36:59.365 --> 37:02.499
- I-I just...
- You okay?

37:04.904 --> 37:06.737
Getting antsy?

37:06.772 --> 37:09.606
I get it,
we've been working really hard.

37:09.641 --> 37:11.475
We're in the home stretch.

37:15.247 --> 37:18.114
Yeah, home stretch.

37:34.366 --> 37:38.734
- I got the Runway Prize.
- Wow.

37:39.511 --> 37:42.038
- What is it?
- I get to say I got the Runway Prize.

37:42.073 --> 37:45.841
And you proved that you
could do it all by yourself.

37:45.877 --> 37:49.612
Yeah, I did.

37:49.647 --> 37:54.549
But now, I'm wondering
if there's a better way.

37:54.584 --> 37:58.453
You know, maybe I don't always
have to do it by myself.

38:06.563 --> 38:09.498
I want this to work for both of us.

38:09.533 --> 38:10.865
The thing is, I don't really have

38:10.901 --> 38:13.701
a great example of how that goes.

38:13.737 --> 38:16.905
See, my mom would go
to the mailbox once a month,

38:16.940 --> 38:20.275
hoping that there would be
a check in there from my dad.

38:23.013 --> 38:25.313
And whenever there wasn't one,

38:25.349 --> 38:28.650
the look of panic on her face...

38:31.688 --> 38:33.721
And allowing you to pay for things,

38:33.757 --> 38:39.594
allowing myself to depend on you,
is hard for me.

38:42.141 --> 38:43.631
I don't know if you've noticed or not,

38:43.667 --> 38:47.035
but I depend on you too.

38:49.305 --> 38:51.739
Are you going to get
the P&L sheet out again?

38:51.775 --> 38:54.141
- Do I need to?
- I think I got it.

38:55.645 --> 38:57.545
You owe me $1 million.

39:00.316 --> 39:03.885
So, um...

39:03.920 --> 39:06.554
is the sewing machine still here?

39:06.590 --> 39:09.067
I haven't had a chance to return it yet.

39:09.102 --> 39:13.159
Don't. I'll take it.

39:13.195 --> 39:14.928
And thank you.

39:32.648 --> 39:35.916
- Kat.
- Hi.

39:35.951 --> 39:37.884
Hi.

39:41.856 --> 39:45.491
- I'm glad you called.
- Yeah.

39:46.301 --> 39:49.309
Adena, look,
I just started seeing someone.

39:49.344 --> 39:52.632
- I know.
- And she's great.

39:54.502 --> 39:58.971
She's really great. I'm happy.

39:59.007 --> 40:01.373
Then I'm happy you're happy.

40:05.847 --> 40:10.616
But, I... I just, uh...

40:10.652 --> 40:14.620
never really understood
what happened to us.

40:14.656 --> 40:16.087
I thought about it a lot,

40:16.123 --> 40:20.959
and maybe it means
I'm insecure or whatever,

40:20.994 --> 40:25.063
but it tortured me.

40:25.098 --> 40:28.333
No, I get it.

40:37.010 --> 40:39.410
Do you want to walk?

40:41.081 --> 40:44.448
Yeah, let's walk.
