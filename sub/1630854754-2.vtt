00:00.000 --> 00:01.768
- Previously on
"RuPaul's Drag Race"...

00:01.768 --> 00:05.873
Welcome to "RuPaul's
Drag Race," season 15.

00:05.873 --> 00:07.140
[screaming]

00:07.140 --> 00:09.009
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

00:09.009 --> 00:11.945
- I'm gagging.
Like, Ariana?

00:11.945 --> 00:14.314
- Mother has arrived.

00:14.314 --> 00:17.684
- You'll be performing
in a talent extravaganza.

00:17.684 --> 00:19.887
- I can really spearhead this
for the group.

00:19.887 --> 00:21.889
- OK, well I do have an idea.

00:21.889 --> 00:23.123
- It kind of just turns

00:23.123 --> 00:25.826
into Aura taking over
the whole thing.

00:25.826 --> 00:27.261
[tense music]

00:27.261 --> 00:29.730
- Y'all ready for some
premiere drama, mama?

00:29.730 --> 00:31.198
[doorbell rings]

00:31.198 --> 00:33.867
[laughter]

00:33.867 --> 00:35.569
Queens of season 15,

00:35.569 --> 00:38.071
meet the queens of season 15.

00:38.071 --> 00:40.507
- We can't even choreograph
this number with eight people.

00:40.507 --> 00:41.508
16?

00:46.313 --> 00:47.381
- [singing] RuPaul's Drag Race

00:47.381 --> 00:48.782
- The winner of
"RuPaul's Drag Race"

00:48.782 --> 00:50.150
receives a one-year supply

00:50.150 --> 00:52.319
of Anastasia Beverly Hills
cosmetics,

00:52.319 --> 00:56.456
and a gagworthy grand prize
of $200,000

00:56.456 --> 00:57.925
served by Cash App.

00:57.925 --> 01:01.094
With extra special guest judge
Ariana Grande.

01:01.094 --> 01:02.329
[singing]
- RuPaul's Drag Race

01:02.329 --> 01:03.664
May the best
drag queen win

01:03.664 --> 01:07.434
Best drag queen win

01:07.434 --> 01:08.669
[dramatic music]

01:08.669 --> 01:09.736
- That's right.

01:09.736 --> 01:11.605
Before this week is over,

01:11.605 --> 01:14.808
one of you will be going home.

01:14.808 --> 01:15.943
- Huh?

01:15.943 --> 01:18.445
- Are there any chocolate bars?

01:18.445 --> 01:20.547
- There are 16 of us!

01:20.547 --> 01:22.582
I thought I was
in competition mode before,

01:22.582 --> 01:26.153
and now it is a competition.

01:26.153 --> 01:28.388
- So for one of you,

01:28.388 --> 01:31.658
it really will be
one night only.

01:31.658 --> 01:33.593
[bright music]

01:33.593 --> 01:35.395
[singing]
- One night only

01:35.395 --> 01:36.964
[laughter]

01:36.964 --> 01:38.498
- I will leave you now

01:38.498 --> 01:41.134
so you can become
better acquainted.

01:42.302 --> 01:44.638
No tongues.
- Oh!

01:44.638 --> 01:47.307
- Now, we got to get
to know these other bitches.

01:47.307 --> 01:49.910
Uh, I guess.

01:49.910 --> 01:52.980
Hey, girl.
How y'all doing?

01:52.980 --> 01:54.348
[screaming]

01:54.348 --> 01:55.983
- Oh, come over.

01:55.983 --> 01:57.317
What's your name?
- Hi. Malaysia.

01:57.317 --> 01:59.453
- So Sugar and Spice?
- Yes.

01:59.453 --> 02:04.024
- I feel like season 15
is, like, trades and twinks.

02:04.024 --> 02:05.325
- Hey, girl!
- Hi, again.

02:05.325 --> 02:07.361
- But I'm still
the trade of the season.

02:07.361 --> 02:09.596
What, what, what?
Mwah.

02:09.596 --> 02:11.264
- OK, so what's the real tea?
- Girl!

02:11.264 --> 02:12.666
- Who's a booger?
Who's a booger?

02:12.666 --> 02:14.368
- I grew up
in the Texas drag scene,

02:14.368 --> 02:17.137
and I know
Mistress Isabelle is no joke.

02:17.137 --> 02:20.007
She is known in Houston
for being that girl

02:20.007 --> 02:22.909
who will cut you down
in a moment's notice.

02:22.909 --> 02:25.245
I am so glad
that I have someone else

02:25.245 --> 02:27.848
to talk massive amounts
of shit with.

02:27.848 --> 02:30.717
- OK, I want to know who knows
each other already prior,

02:30.717 --> 02:31.718
like, from the other people.

02:31.718 --> 02:32.719
- From the other group?

02:32.719 --> 02:33.954
- I know Sasha from back home!

02:33.954 --> 02:35.822
- I do.
- Oh, my God!

02:35.822 --> 02:38.859
Sasha Colby,
that is my LA sister.

02:38.859 --> 02:40.627
- All right
with the drag icon.

02:40.627 --> 02:43.630
- So nice to see you.
- I love you, sis.

02:43.630 --> 02:44.998
- I mean,
I guess you could say

02:44.998 --> 02:47.501
that I know Sugar and Spice
from Instagram.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.636
- Yeah, we're, like--
we're, like, Insta friends.

02:49.636 --> 02:53.240
- Of course, everybody knows
who Sugar and Spice are.

02:53.240 --> 02:55.776
- I feel like all of, like,
my drag friends are virtual,

02:55.776 --> 02:58.178
so now, it's fun to, like,
have friends in person.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.579
And I just want
to, like, touch every--

02:59.579 --> 03:01.081
whoa, that's--uh, no.

03:01.081 --> 03:03.016
[tense music]

03:03.016 --> 03:06.620
- Chile, let's see if they
can last more than 15 seconds,

03:06.620 --> 03:11.024
or, well, however many seconds
it is they give you on TikTok.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.626
- Can I ask
what your entrance line was?

03:12.626 --> 03:14.394
- Well, we trotted in together.

03:14.394 --> 03:15.595
- Uh-huh.
- You were like,

03:15.595 --> 03:17.397
"Well, this doesn't
look like the toy store.

03:17.397 --> 03:19.533
And then, I was like,
"Sweetie, that was my line."

03:19.533 --> 03:20.967
And then, we started,
like, fighting--

03:20.967 --> 03:23.470
- It was giving rehearsary
or, like, the doll you pull

03:23.470 --> 03:25.305
and just, like,
the little lines come out.

03:25.305 --> 03:26.706
- I've been waiting
for them to shut up.

03:26.706 --> 03:28.075
[laughter]

03:28.075 --> 03:29.843
You're gonna be here
for a while.

03:29.843 --> 03:31.111
- I got, like, yelled at once.

03:31.111 --> 03:32.479
Like, my librarian was--

03:32.479 --> 03:33.647
- Again, enough about them.

03:33.647 --> 03:35.148
[laughter]

03:35.148 --> 03:37.050
- That's real.
That's real.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.552
- Girls, I thought
we were all friends.

03:38.552 --> 03:39.886
I'm starting to feel like,
oh, no,

03:39.886 --> 03:42.656
it's gonna be me and Sugar
against the world.

03:42.656 --> 03:44.958
- OK, you guys,
there's 16 of us now.

03:44.958 --> 03:46.760
You guys want to go back
to rehearsing?

03:46.760 --> 03:48.295
- We should.
- Yes.

03:48.295 --> 03:50.430
- We got to add them
into our choreography

03:50.430 --> 03:52.632
that we just worked hard on.

03:53.967 --> 03:55.535
Do you guys want to see
what we came up with?

03:55.535 --> 03:57.370
- Yes, show us, show us.
- OK.

03:57.370 --> 03:59.106
- We'll be over here
just judging.

04:01.608 --> 04:03.343
[laughter]
- Hit it!

04:03.343 --> 04:05.412
[singing]
all: I wanna be on top

04:05.412 --> 04:07.047
And let the children know

04:07.047 --> 04:10.283
[singing]
- Let the children know

04:10.283 --> 04:11.818
[singing]
all: Will I get the chop?

04:11.818 --> 04:12.819
[music fades]

04:12.819 --> 04:14.154
[quirky music]

04:14.154 --> 04:15.789
- Y'all said
y'all prepared something,

04:15.789 --> 04:18.391
but this is, like, ten seconds
of high kicks and chopping.

04:18.391 --> 04:21.261
And it's not gonna work
with 16 of us on stage.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.996
- I say that we stop ours,

04:22.996 --> 04:24.598
like right before
"tonight, tonight,"

04:24.598 --> 04:26.666
and then they come in
from the back.

04:26.666 --> 04:28.969
- No, I think we all
should just be on together.

04:28.969 --> 04:31.671
- Baby, we got to choreograph
a whole opening number,

04:31.671 --> 04:33.140
and the girls
have already started!

04:33.140 --> 04:34.941
So, like,
what are we gonna do?

04:34.941 --> 04:36.409
- I'll place people.
- Yes.

04:36.409 --> 04:37.944
- So do we have to choreograph
our own version?

04:37.944 --> 04:39.446
Are we gonna pick up
where they left off?

04:39.446 --> 04:42.349
- Where do you want me, baby?
- We'll pop you right here.

04:42.349 --> 04:43.984
- OK.
- It's like "Tetris."

04:43.984 --> 04:45.051
Where are we gonna fit?

04:45.051 --> 04:47.554
- I have a suggestion.
- Yes?

04:47.554 --> 04:48.989
- We have eight new girls.

04:48.989 --> 04:50.724
I think that our group
should be on one side,

04:50.724 --> 04:52.092
and their group
should be on one side.

04:52.092 --> 04:53.593
It'd be like,
"tonight, tonight,"

04:53.593 --> 04:55.996
then "one night only,"
and everybody mix in together.

04:55.996 --> 04:59.399
- Should we listen to the song
while we're together maybe?

04:59.399 --> 05:01.401
- They come in when we come in?
[singing] - Too many chefs

05:01.401 --> 05:02.702
- Where are we entering from,
she's asking?

05:02.702 --> 05:04.771
[singing]
- In the kitchen

05:04.771 --> 05:06.840
- Can we put one person
in charge of saying everything

05:06.840 --> 05:09.376
because there's too many people
saying a bunch of shit?

05:09.376 --> 05:11.077
We are getting nowhere.

05:11.077 --> 05:12.345
I'm feeling very frustrated

05:12.345 --> 05:14.080
because I'm not the best
of choreography,

05:14.080 --> 05:16.550
and I know it's gonna
take me a long time to learn.

05:16.550 --> 05:18.752
For one person, it really
is gonna be only one night,

05:18.752 --> 05:20.287
so I want to make sure
it's perfect

05:20.287 --> 05:21.555
and it's what it needs to be,
you know what I mean?

05:21.555 --> 05:22.923
- Right, right, right.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.391
- I'm not trying to be a bitch
and, like, dominate.

05:24.391 --> 05:25.892
I just--
- You don't have to try.

05:25.892 --> 05:27.260
- [chuckles]

05:27.260 --> 05:29.129
[strained laughter]

05:29.129 --> 05:31.865
Mistress and Irene
are already going at it.

05:31.865 --> 05:33.266
I mean,
I thought me and Spice

05:33.266 --> 05:35.602
were gonna be the drama
this season, OK?

05:35.602 --> 05:36.903
- One person needs
to be in charge.

05:36.903 --> 05:39.406
The extra comments from people
is unnecessary.

05:39.406 --> 05:42.342
- [scoffs]
Jesus Christ.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.978
- Me and Sugar are on totally
opposite sides of the room,

05:44.978 --> 05:46.613
and we just keep
making eye contact.

05:46.613 --> 05:47.914
Like, we would just have
our little, like,

05:47.914 --> 05:49.049
inside joke faces.

05:49.049 --> 05:50.750
We're like,
this is ridiculous.

05:50.750 --> 05:52.552
- I know
that we already had a routine,

05:52.552 --> 05:54.688
but I feel like we really need
to start from scratch,

05:54.688 --> 05:56.923
like, and--
- Scrapping everything,

05:56.923 --> 05:58.959
I just think
it would take too much time.

05:58.959 --> 06:00.694
- Speaking of time,
we don't have a lot,

06:00.694 --> 06:02.195
so I think
we should just, like,

06:02.195 --> 06:03.597
get back to work
and start doing this.

06:03.597 --> 06:05.131
- All right, bottoms,
let's take it from the top.

06:05.131 --> 06:07.300
All right?
- Yeah!

06:07.300 --> 06:09.636
- I'm really nervous about
how this never gonna come out.

06:09.636 --> 06:11.338
I don't know
if we about to go to war,

06:11.338 --> 06:13.907
but I do know that
it's finna be a long night.

06:13.907 --> 06:15.408
I'm telling you,
it's finna be a long night.

06:16.743 --> 06:19.412
[upbeat music]

06:19.412 --> 06:20.947
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!

06:20.947 --> 06:22.349
It's move-in day

06:22.349 --> 06:24.818
- Chile, let me throw
this mug on real quick.

06:24.818 --> 06:25.885
- Buenos días, baby!

06:25.885 --> 06:27.520
It is a new day
in the Werk Room,

06:27.520 --> 06:29.789
and we're gonna do our talent
show in front of the judges.

06:29.789 --> 06:31.625
Here we go.
Engines are running.

06:31.625 --> 06:33.026
The game has begun!

06:33.026 --> 06:34.094
- Let's go grab our stuff.

06:34.094 --> 06:35.595
[exciting music]

06:35.595 --> 06:36.963
- Ah!
- Ah!

06:36.963 --> 06:38.732
- It is a madhouse.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.900
We all have to claim stations,

06:40.900 --> 06:43.470
and the energy is just,
go, go, go, go, go.

06:43.470 --> 06:45.038
- Go in here.
Go in here. Go in here.

06:45.038 --> 06:48.008
- Sugar's running
to secure our clothing,

06:48.008 --> 06:50.277
and then I run
to secure the makeup station

06:50.277 --> 06:51.945
because we share a lot
of the same makeup.

06:51.945 --> 06:54.681
And also, like, it's our thing,
getting ready together.

06:54.681 --> 06:57.217
It's like, let us just be
our little twinning selves.

06:57.217 --> 06:58.418
- We got our station.
- Yas!

06:58.418 --> 07:00.487
Here we go.
- Here we go.

07:00.487 --> 07:02.355
- [groans]

07:02.355 --> 07:04.357
- For someone who doesn't
wear a lot of clothes,

07:04.357 --> 07:06.092
I sure got a lot of shit.

07:06.092 --> 07:09.262
Mistress, what are these
little chicken biscuit-ass...

07:09.262 --> 07:11.264
[laughter]

07:11.264 --> 07:13.867
Did you bring any high heels
to the show?

07:13.867 --> 07:15.602
all: Ah!
- Oh!

07:15.602 --> 07:17.537
- Wait,
are Mistress and Irene--

07:17.537 --> 07:18.605
do they hate each other?

07:18.605 --> 07:20.807
It's very, like,
conflicting energy.

07:20.807 --> 07:22.275
- Let's compare our pads.
- Are you ready?

07:22.275 --> 07:25.545
- Ready? One...
- Three, two...

07:25.545 --> 07:27.480
- Shut up!
- [laughs] What are these?

07:27.480 --> 07:29.215
This is a pancake...
- Yeah.

07:29.215 --> 07:31.151
- [laughs]

07:31.151 --> 07:33.320
- That's a--
it's an actual pancake.

07:33.320 --> 07:34.721
[laughter]

07:34.721 --> 07:36.489
- OK, I need a--

07:36.489 --> 07:39.025
I don't know where to begin.
- Degrease.

07:39.025 --> 07:40.694
- Even though
I am the older twin,

07:40.694 --> 07:44.064
sometimes I feel like
Sugar is my older twin

07:44.064 --> 07:46.299
and she's, like, coming--
like, she's gonna make it OK.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.068
- Now, you guys are,
like, notorious

07:48.068 --> 07:49.836
for taking a really long time
to paint, right?

07:49.836 --> 07:51.538
- Yeah, right? It's bad. That's
why we're, like, rushing.

07:51.538 --> 07:52.639
I'm like--
- I noticed.

07:52.639 --> 07:53.973
You were the first two in--
- I know.

07:53.973 --> 07:55.842
I said, "Bolt. Get our thing.
We need to start."

07:55.842 --> 07:57.010
- How long
does it normally take y'all?

07:57.010 --> 07:58.211
- When we were back
on the Island,

07:58.211 --> 07:59.546
like, if we had all day
to get ready...

07:59.546 --> 08:02.515
- It would take all day.
- It would take us all day.

08:02.515 --> 08:04.617
- Oh, Lord have mercy.

08:04.617 --> 08:05.919
The twins just
seem to be living

08:05.919 --> 08:07.987
in their own
little La La land.

08:07.987 --> 08:10.423
I'm not sure
how this is gonna turn out.

08:13.326 --> 08:14.661
Luxx?
- Yes?

08:14.661 --> 08:15.995
- Do you know what this is?

08:15.995 --> 08:18.865
- A 40-inch unit, I guess.
[laughter]

08:18.865 --> 08:20.767
- Wait, I think
I have a measuring tape.

08:20.767 --> 08:22.135
- Are we really
about to do this?

08:22.135 --> 08:23.370
- Yeah, let's find out.

08:23.370 --> 08:25.171
- Yours is definitely longer
than mine,

08:25.171 --> 08:26.239
but they're close.

08:26.239 --> 08:28.141
- Well, this is 40 inches.

08:29.309 --> 08:30.877
- [sighs]

08:30.877 --> 08:34.080
Irene's may be 40 inches
or it may be a little longer,

08:34.080 --> 08:36.816
but at least my hair
is thick to the bottom.

08:36.816 --> 08:39.953
Yours truly is probably,
like, the same length.

08:39.953 --> 08:42.021
Yours just gets a little,
like, withered at the end.

08:42.021 --> 08:43.022
- Withered!

08:43.022 --> 08:44.991
[laughter]

08:46.326 --> 08:47.660
- Luxx, how did you
get your start?

08:47.660 --> 08:50.530
- I couldn't go out
'cause I wasn't of age.

08:50.530 --> 08:52.732
I turned 21
during the pandemic,

08:52.732 --> 08:54.434
so I was just on Instagram.

08:54.434 --> 08:56.069
- Don't you feel, like,
people kind of shade,

08:56.069 --> 08:58.338
like, social media, but, like,
for when you're younger queen,

08:58.338 --> 08:59.506
that's kind of all you have

08:59.506 --> 09:00.774
'cause you're not allowed
in the club?

09:00.774 --> 09:02.275
- That's all you have
when you're young.

09:02.275 --> 09:05.678
I think social media is a very
big part of not only my drag

09:05.678 --> 09:07.480
but drag at large now.

09:07.480 --> 09:09.616
It's kind of, like,
a digital portfolio

09:09.616 --> 09:12.252
for people to look at you
and see what you can do.

09:12.252 --> 09:14.654
That's how I got, like,
my followers during quarantine.

09:14.654 --> 09:16.656
Since I couldn't gag the girls
in the club,

09:16.656 --> 09:18.925
I gagged them
from their living room couches.

09:18.925 --> 09:20.960
- Let's face it.
It's 2022.

09:20.960 --> 09:22.829
If you're not a drag queen
on social media,

09:22.829 --> 09:23.830
what are you doing?
- It's kind of like,

09:23.830 --> 09:24.998
what are you doing?
- That's

09:24.998 --> 09:26.332
how you make your business.
- Exactly.

09:26.332 --> 09:28.601
- It's like, I think
it's a really stupid,

09:28.601 --> 09:30.236
like, mindset
for people to have,

09:30.236 --> 09:32.572
that like,
"Oh, you can't be talented..."

09:32.572 --> 09:33.640
- Right, right.
- "In person

09:33.640 --> 09:35.175
because you do social media."

09:35.175 --> 09:36.543
And it's typically the girls

09:36.543 --> 09:39.279
who don't do well
on social media, you know?

09:39.279 --> 09:42.115
[tense music]

09:42.115 --> 09:43.650
- America,

09:43.650 --> 09:46.352
I have nothing against
social media sensations,

09:46.352 --> 09:50.123
but it takes a lot of growth
to get to where you got to get.

09:50.123 --> 09:53.460
A lot of these new girls, it's
happening overnight for them,

09:53.460 --> 09:56.029
but I feel like you got to know
how to walk the walk

09:56.029 --> 09:58.198
and talk the talk, boo!

10:00.500 --> 10:02.035
- So how do you feel
everything went yesterday?

10:02.035 --> 10:03.403
Were y'all gagged to see us?

10:03.403 --> 10:05.438
- Who would gag to see you?
- [laughs]

10:05.438 --> 10:08.274
- Not the two enemies
sitting next to each other.

10:08.274 --> 10:09.742
[music fades]

10:09.742 --> 10:11.244
- Girl, what the fuck
are you talking about?

10:11.244 --> 10:13.446
- Oh my God. Wait, did you guys
think we were enemies?

10:13.446 --> 10:15.248
- They thought
that we were bickering.

10:15.248 --> 10:16.816
[laughter]

10:16.816 --> 10:18.585
- Mistress and I are talking

10:18.585 --> 10:22.121
the way that I talk to girls
backstage at a drag show.

10:22.121 --> 10:23.523
- I thought
y'all hated each other.

10:23.523 --> 10:25.158
- You can really tell
how young

10:25.158 --> 10:26.726
and inexperienced
some of these girls are

10:26.726 --> 10:29.395
because they think that
a little bit of light shade

10:29.395 --> 10:31.164
means that you're enemies
with someone.

10:31.164 --> 10:32.732
- I thought
someone was gonna, like,

10:32.732 --> 10:34.901
throw a punch, like...
- [laughs]

10:34.901 --> 10:36.703
I'm glad the twins
are getting to see me

10:36.703 --> 10:39.506
because they get to see
what a real drag queen gives.

10:39.506 --> 10:41.241
If someone's your sister
and you like someone,

10:41.241 --> 10:42.909
you read them back and forth.

10:42.909 --> 10:44.744
- Can we talk
about when the groups merged

10:44.744 --> 10:47.213
and everyone was, like,
on the twins' ass at first?

10:47.213 --> 10:49.983
Whenever they walked in, I saw,
like, nails on the floor.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.985
The lace was waving at me
on her wig.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.120
And, like, for me,
I'm not gonna talk shit.

10:54.120 --> 10:55.622
Like, if I'ma talk shit--
- You just did!

10:55.622 --> 10:57.156
- No, no, no, if I'ma
talk shit, I'ma help you.

10:57.156 --> 10:59.359
I'm not gonna just be--I'm
not gonna just let it happen.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.761
- And you ended up being
one of the sweetest, yeah.

11:01.761 --> 11:03.963
- You were giving, like,
Mayor of Dragville.

11:03.963 --> 11:05.131
You were looking around.

11:05.131 --> 11:07.734
You had a magnifying glass.

11:07.734 --> 11:09.402
- Not Mayor of Dragville.

11:09.402 --> 11:11.905
[laughter]

11:13.006 --> 11:14.407
- What are you doing
for your talent?

11:14.407 --> 11:16.442
- I'm a hip-hop dancer.
- Nice, nice.

11:16.442 --> 11:18.645
- And I kind of incorporate
that in my drag sometimes.

11:18.645 --> 11:20.880
- OK.
Amethyst, how about you?

11:20.880 --> 11:24.851
- It's technically a lip sync,
but it's my kind of lip sync.

11:24.851 --> 11:25.985
Let's just say that.

11:25.985 --> 11:27.420
- I'm gonna sing.

11:27.420 --> 11:29.822
- Original song?
- Yes, actually.

11:29.822 --> 11:31.324
- Yas!
- Yeah, I'm really excited

11:31.324 --> 11:35.161
because I sing in, like,
95% of the shows that I do.

11:35.161 --> 11:36.596
It's season 15.

11:36.596 --> 11:38.398
You got to step it up,

11:38.398 --> 11:40.667
so I'm singing live.

11:40.667 --> 11:42.735
And I think the judges are
gonna be really impressed

11:42.735 --> 11:45.471
with the fact that I'm willing
to take such a risk.

11:45.471 --> 11:47.140
- Loosey has range.

11:47.140 --> 11:49.742
- I would like to say
that I have range as well.

11:49.742 --> 11:50.877
- What are you doing?

11:50.877 --> 11:54.314
- I'm not gonna Ruveal yet.
- OK.

11:54.314 --> 11:55.782
- These girls
do not need to know

11:55.782 --> 11:57.016
what I'm doing for talent.

11:57.016 --> 11:58.851
I'm not showing you
all my cards.

11:58.851 --> 12:01.521
I'm from Sin City. I know
how to play poker, bitch.

12:01.521 --> 12:04.090
- Do you know what anybody else
is doing for their talent?

12:04.090 --> 12:07.026
- I don't know. I heard
something about ice water.

12:07.026 --> 12:08.728
- Ice water?

12:08.728 --> 12:10.363
Who was doing ice water?

12:10.363 --> 12:11.731
Where did you hear that from?
- It's like the next step--

12:11.731 --> 12:14.367
Irene. I think Irene's doing
something with ice water.

12:14.367 --> 12:15.868
- Irene?
- Yes, ma'am?

12:15.868 --> 12:19.072
- I just heard you're using
ice water in your talent show.

12:19.072 --> 12:22.475
- Yeah, I'm making a glass of
ice water for my talent show.

12:22.475 --> 12:24.310
My mom used to make it
for me all the time.

12:24.310 --> 12:26.012
[laughter]

12:26.012 --> 12:28.181
- While it sounds
very ridiculous,

12:28.181 --> 12:30.416
I feel like after last season

12:30.416 --> 12:33.219
when Willow Pill kind of
knocked it out of the park

12:33.219 --> 12:35.588
doing
some obscure talent number,

12:35.588 --> 12:37.423
now it's gonna be a contest

12:37.423 --> 12:40.059
of who can out-obscure
the obscurest.

12:41.861 --> 12:44.797
[exciting music]

12:44.797 --> 12:46.466
- Oh, bitch, she's on.

12:46.466 --> 12:47.567
- Your lips?

12:47.567 --> 12:49.302
- The mug.
- [laughs]

12:51.104 --> 12:53.206
- Spice, come on.
- I know, I know.

12:53.206 --> 12:54.841
- You might want
to speed it up there, twins.

12:54.841 --> 12:56.075
- Ooh!

12:56.075 --> 12:57.610
- The rest of us are
in full drag--

12:57.610 --> 13:01.280
corsets laced, wigs glued,
makeup on, shoes on.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.783
The twins are, like,
still struggling to get ready.

13:05.852 --> 13:07.353
- Let me actually
just do it for you.

13:07.353 --> 13:08.688
- You'd think that
with two of them,

13:08.688 --> 13:10.556
they'd be able to get ready
in a timely manner.

13:10.556 --> 13:12.892
- Sugar, it's not
on a wig stand thing?

13:13.926 --> 13:15.728
- Where are they?
Oh, my God.

13:15.728 --> 13:17.330
I am running so behind.

13:17.330 --> 13:20.433
I can't find my clothes.
I can't find my wig.

13:20.433 --> 13:21.434
I, like, went through them.
Yes.

13:21.434 --> 13:22.535
I don't think it's in there.

13:22.535 --> 13:23.703
- We're literally seconds away

13:23.703 --> 13:25.004
from performing
on the main stage.

13:25.004 --> 13:26.906
First impressions
are so important,

13:26.906 --> 13:28.441
and I do not want
to mess this up.

13:28.441 --> 13:31.110
Is it this?
- Oh, my God, no.

13:31.110 --> 13:33.312
- Then where the hell
is the wig?

13:33.312 --> 13:36.416
- Girl, the twins are,
like, on overload.

13:36.416 --> 13:37.417
- Can you please
try to find the wig?

13:37.417 --> 13:38.551
Please, please, please.

13:38.551 --> 13:40.520
- The dolls are,
like, malfunctioning.

13:40.520 --> 13:43.022
- Like, you packed it. I didn't
pack it, so you would know.

13:43.022 --> 13:44.524
Oh, my God.

13:44.524 --> 13:47.026
- The Doublemint twins
done lost they mind.

13:47.026 --> 13:48.561
Somebody going home.

13:48.561 --> 13:50.830
Baby, you is at risk right now.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.899
[tense music]

13:52.899 --> 13:55.935
[dramatic music]

14:01.207 --> 14:03.076
- [laughs]

14:05.978 --> 14:07.380
Cover girl

14:07.380 --> 14:09.716
Put the bass in your walk

14:09.716 --> 14:11.117
Head to toe

14:11.117 --> 14:12.885
Let your whole body talk

14:12.885 --> 14:14.220
[cheers and applause]

14:14.220 --> 14:15.755
And what?

14:15.755 --> 14:19.225
Welcome to the season premiere
of "RuPaul's Drag Race."

14:19.225 --> 14:21.294
She's a dangerous woman.

14:21.294 --> 14:23.329
Michelle Visage.

14:23.329 --> 14:25.465
- Oh!
More like slippery when wet.

14:25.465 --> 14:28.201
Oh, oh, oh!
- Oh, oh, oh!

14:28.201 --> 14:30.503
The hilarious Ross Mathews.

14:30.503 --> 14:33.372
Now, don't you have
something to show us?

14:33.372 --> 14:34.774
- Well, Ru,

14:34.774 --> 14:36.743
I'm married!

14:36.743 --> 14:38.144
Sorry, ladies.

14:38.144 --> 14:39.879
[laughter]
- Aw.

14:39.879 --> 14:42.381
- Well, we wish you
and Wellinthon

14:42.381 --> 14:43.983
all the love in the world.

14:43.983 --> 14:45.752
Condragulations.
- Aw, thank you.

14:45.752 --> 14:46.753
Next.

14:46.753 --> 14:48.154
[laughter]

14:48.154 --> 14:49.555
- And finally,

14:49.555 --> 14:53.259
her hair has been
defying gravity since 2010.

14:53.259 --> 14:55.027
It's Ariana Grande.

14:55.027 --> 14:58.231
- Oh, thank you, Ru.
Apparently so have my knockers.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.366
[laughter]

15:00.366 --> 15:02.101
I love being here so much.

15:02.101 --> 15:04.103
I'm having
an out-of-body experience.

15:04.103 --> 15:05.671
I love you so much.
Thank you.

15:05.671 --> 15:08.074
- We love having you here.

15:08.074 --> 15:09.909
This week,
we challenged our queens

15:09.909 --> 15:14.747
to entertaint us in the largest
talent extravaganza ever.

15:14.747 --> 15:17.016
Racers, start your engines.

15:17.016 --> 15:19.485
And may
the best drag queen win.

15:19.485 --> 15:21.854
[boisterous music]

15:21.854 --> 15:25.091
Let the talent extravaganza
begin.

15:28.161 --> 15:29.962
[singing]
all: Tonight, tonight

15:31.731 --> 15:34.400
One night only

15:34.400 --> 15:37.570
Am I the greatest star?

15:37.570 --> 15:41.374
Or am I full of bologna?

15:41.374 --> 15:43.709
It's time to make my mark

15:43.709 --> 15:47.313
I'm yours
for one night only

15:47.313 --> 15:51.117
I want to be on top
to let the children know

15:51.117 --> 15:54.220
- [singing] Let the children
know

15:54.220 --> 15:55.988
[singing]
all: Will I get the chop

15:55.988 --> 15:59.692
Or be the star
of the show?

15:59.692 --> 16:01.227
Tonight, tonight

16:01.227 --> 16:02.295
[singing]
- One night only

16:02.295 --> 16:03.162

16:05.965 --> 16:08.835
Herstory is gonna be made

16:08.835 --> 16:10.436
The strong will survive

16:10.436 --> 16:12.572
The weak will be slayed

16:12.572 --> 16:15.675
It's time to do or die

16:15.675 --> 16:17.210
[singing]
- One night only

16:17.210 --> 16:19.245
[singing]
- One night only

16:19.245 --> 16:22.114
[singing]

16:22.114 --> 16:23.716

[laughter]

16:32.458 --> 16:36.529
[cheers and applause]

16:36.529 --> 16:39.398

16:39.398 --> 16:42.668
Up first,
Malaysia Babydoll Foxx.

16:42.668 --> 16:43.970
- Yes.

16:43.970 --> 16:46.672
Put your hands up,
season 15.

16:46.672 --> 16:49.041
Yeah, all my queen,

16:49.041 --> 16:50.543
Where you at?

16:50.543 --> 16:52.979
Walked in the Werk Room
like I'm a boss bitch

16:52.979 --> 16:54.180
I'm the fattest
and the baddest

16:54.180 --> 16:55.381
What you thought, chick

16:55.381 --> 16:56.616
Tell these other girls

16:56.616 --> 16:57.950
To pack it up

16:57.950 --> 16:59.218
Ain't no friends
in this race

16:59.218 --> 17:00.853
'Cause I'm in the league,
bitch

17:00.853 --> 17:02.555
You little bastards
keep on coming for the crown

17:02.555 --> 17:04.557
'Cause winners only last,
so I'm winning every round

17:04.557 --> 17:05.858
- Yas!
- Yas!

17:05.858 --> 17:07.293
[singing]
- Now they callin' me cocky

17:07.293 --> 17:08.561
Charisma, uniqueness

17:08.561 --> 17:10.096
Nerve is what I call it

17:10.096 --> 17:12.498
Yeah, I put the "T"
in talent

17:12.498 --> 17:15.534
XXXL,

17:15.534 --> 17:18.004
And you know I'm a savage,

17:26.779 --> 17:28.114
I'm on the main stage

17:28.114 --> 17:29.749
And I'm living out my dream,
bitch

17:29.749 --> 17:32.218
I'm a queen,

17:32.218 --> 17:33.819
I'm a queen,

17:33.819 --> 17:35.154

[singing] - I'm a queen

17:35.154 --> 17:36.622

Go head, Mama Ru,

17:39.992 --> 17:42.094
[laughter]

17:42.094 --> 17:44.497
[applause]

17:44.497 --> 17:47.199
- Let's hear it for Spice.

17:47.199 --> 17:49.235
- Uh, I'm bored.

17:49.235 --> 17:50.603
- [laughs]
- I think it's about time

17:50.603 --> 17:53.205
for me
to spice things up a bit.

17:53.205 --> 17:55.041
Listen up,
and let you know

17:55.041 --> 17:57.109
I'm comin' in
with a spicy flow

17:57.109 --> 17:58.911
So get dolled up
and be a ho

17:58.911 --> 18:00.746
Pull up to the club
and drop it low

18:00.746 --> 18:02.515
- Ah!

18:02.515 --> 18:03.449
[singing]
- The boys want to know

18:03.449 --> 18:04.517
[singing]
Where my dingaling go

18:04.517 --> 18:06.519
Where my dingaling go,
where my dingaling go

18:06.519 --> 18:08.054
The boys want to know
where my dingaling go

18:08.054 --> 18:10.523
Where my dingaling go,
where my dingaling go

18:10.523 --> 18:12.058
Hold up,
you know I'm a doll

18:12.058 --> 18:13.893
Like the plastic ones
you can get at the mall

18:13.893 --> 18:15.728
Ain't got parts
like a normal girl

18:15.728 --> 18:17.563
'Cause I is a drag queen
and I'ma rock your world

18:17.563 --> 18:19.332
See you looking at me
with curiosity

18:19.332 --> 18:20.366
If you want
to grab the goodies

18:20.366 --> 18:24.971
Then you gotta pay a fee

18:24.971 --> 18:25.471
Hangin' downstairs like,
sis, what's the tea?

18:25.471 --> 18:27.039
If you see me untucked,
that's on you, not me

18:27.039 --> 18:28.908
The boys want to know
where my dingaling go

18:28.908 --> 18:30.242
Where my dingaling go,
where my dingaling go

18:30.242 --> 18:32.078
Look around,
I'm the drag princess

18:32.078 --> 18:33.946
That, that, that, that,
that, that, that dingaling

18:33.946 --> 18:35.581
Boys call me up like,
like dingaling

18:35.581 --> 18:37.416
I no the man 'cause
I don't want to fling-a-ling

18:37.416 --> 18:39.418
But I might change my mind
if I get that bling-a-ling

18:39.418 --> 18:41.354
Bl-bl-bl-bl-
bl-bl-bl-bling-a-ling

18:41.354 --> 18:43.222
That, that, that, that,
that, that, that dingaling

18:43.222 --> 18:46.058
Dingaling, dingaling,
dingaling, mmm

18:46.058 --> 18:47.660
- Yas!

18:47.660 --> 18:49.996
[cheers and laughter]

18:49.996 --> 18:51.664
- Seeing Spice perform
without me,

18:51.664 --> 18:54.600
I am a proud little gay mom.

18:54.600 --> 18:57.470
She always feels like
she has to rely on me,

18:57.470 --> 19:01.107
and she proves that she can
be a bad bitch without Sugar.

19:01.107 --> 19:03.943
- I just love how the coffin
pulls it all together.

19:03.943 --> 19:07.713
[laughter]

19:07.713 --> 19:10.816
Hey, sis.
It's Luxx Noir London.

19:10.816 --> 19:13.152
[singing]
- The vibrations of the music

19:13.152 --> 19:15.054
Get my body groovin'

19:15.054 --> 19:18.591
And I can feel it
from head to toe

19:18.591 --> 19:19.692
Tonight's gonna be

19:19.692 --> 19:21.027
A good night
- Yas!

19:21.027 --> 19:24.530
Baby, I already know

19:24.530 --> 19:26.632
Already know

19:26.632 --> 19:28.367
Round and around

19:28.367 --> 19:30.436
Get low to the sound

19:30.436 --> 19:32.304
Get up and get down

19:32.304 --> 19:34.240
Get low to the ground

19:34.240 --> 19:35.541
- Werk!
- The hair is giving.

19:35.541 --> 19:37.676
The body is giving.
The mug is giving.

19:37.676 --> 19:38.944
It might be Christmas

19:38.944 --> 19:40.346
because the whole thing
is just giving.

19:41.947 --> 19:43.883
[singing]
- The face, the brand, the
fantasy

19:43.883 --> 19:45.751
When I'm on the floor,
I feel the beat

19:45.751 --> 19:47.920
Every look is fire,
I bring the heat

19:47.920 --> 19:49.989
Leave the bitches in the
dust, they can't compete

19:49.989 --> 19:51.490
You do not want it

19:51.490 --> 19:53.692
I come through
and I funk shiz

19:53.692 --> 19:55.394
I'll make you want
to force quit

19:55.394 --> 19:57.463
Can't show up
or you're done, sis

19:57.463 --> 19:59.165
Mug make 'em
turn their heads quick

19:59.165 --> 20:01.200
Gonna do a double take
like Ross Lynch

20:01.200 --> 20:03.102
Better call me Rick
'cause I'm real slick

20:03.102 --> 20:06.072
Goin' round and round,
and I won't quit

20:06.072 --> 20:07.173
all: Yas!

20:07.173 --> 20:09.208
[cheers and applause]

20:09.208 --> 20:12.344
- Somebody is
going home tonight.

20:12.344 --> 20:14.580
Not me, though.
[laughs]

20:14.580 --> 20:18.317
- Now presenting
Mistress Isabelle Brooks.

20:18.317 --> 20:21.620
- Baby, the heavyweight
champion is now here, honey,

20:21.620 --> 20:23.255
representing
for the big girls.

20:23.255 --> 20:24.690
Let's go.
There's never been

20:24.690 --> 20:27.293
A chubby girl
to take the win

20:27.293 --> 20:29.161
Get ready, bitches,
take a look

20:29.161 --> 20:30.930
I'm the next of kin

20:30.930 --> 20:32.932
I'ma smack you down.
I'ma knock you out

20:32.932 --> 20:34.867
I'll bite a ear off
if I have to

20:34.867 --> 20:36.902
Well, hopefully I won't
have to bite your ear

20:36.902 --> 20:38.537
But, baby,
I got my eye on you

20:38.537 --> 20:40.206
Listen up, baby,
I'm the bitch to beat

20:40.206 --> 20:42.308
- Mistress is
very intimidating.

20:42.308 --> 20:43.742
[singing]
- Honey, go back and take a seat

20:43.742 --> 20:46.078
- She really packs a punch.

20:46.078 --> 20:46.946
[singing]
- I got it, you want it

20:46.946 --> 20:47.813
[singing]
I crave it, you taste it

20:47.813 --> 20:49.582
I need it, I love it,
Will never replace it

20:49.582 --> 20:51.383
I'll shake it and throw it,
drop down, make you know it

20:51.383 --> 20:53.519
I'm snatching the crown from
the last queen that holds it

20:53.519 --> 20:55.121
Big, big, big,
big, big, big

20:55.121 --> 20:57.089
Big, big, big,
big, big, big, big, big

20:57.089 --> 20:58.991
Big, big, big,
big girl

20:58.991 --> 21:00.960
Big, big, big,
big, big, big, big, big--

21:00.960 --> 21:02.261
[panting]

21:02.261 --> 21:04.296
Hold on.
My sugar got low.

21:04.296 --> 21:06.499
Thank God
I have this delicious

21:06.499 --> 21:09.034
RuPaul chocolate bar.
[laughter]

21:09.034 --> 21:10.603
Big, big, big,
big, big, big

21:10.603 --> 21:13.906
- Yas,
and pulling out the chocolate.

21:13.906 --> 21:15.040
[singing]
- Big girl

21:15.040 --> 21:16.909
Big girl

21:16.909 --> 21:17.910
What?
- Oh!

21:17.910 --> 21:20.779
- Ah!
- Yas!

21:20.779 --> 21:22.014
[laughter]

21:22.014 --> 21:23.215
- All right, y'all.

21:23.215 --> 21:25.651
It's time
to get Loosey LaDuca.

21:25.651 --> 21:27.086
[singing]
- Let loose

21:27.086 --> 21:29.455
I said, let loose

21:29.455 --> 21:30.823
You're holding it together

21:30.823 --> 21:32.424
Baby, what's the use?

21:32.424 --> 21:33.559
Let loose

21:33.559 --> 21:35.561
I said, let loose

21:35.561 --> 21:37.296
I'm giving you permission

21:37.296 --> 21:39.465
You've got no excuse

21:39.465 --> 21:42.001
Call me queen
of the thunder

21:42.001 --> 21:43.169
- So Loosey sings live.

21:43.169 --> 21:45.104
[singing]
- I'm taking over the voltage

21:45.104 --> 21:47.173
- And it's definitely a choice.

21:47.173 --> 21:48.474
[singing]
- Pick up the music

21:48.474 --> 21:50.943
And put on
your dancing shoes

21:50.943 --> 21:52.278
- Absolutely a choice.

21:52.278 --> 21:53.312
[singing]
- The synthesizer takes you

21:53.312 --> 21:55.114
As you toss your hair

21:55.114 --> 21:58.250
Loosen up your buttons
and say like a prayer

21:58.250 --> 22:01.820
When they start dancing,
it gets hot up in here

22:01.820 --> 22:04.290
So you better beware

22:04.290 --> 22:05.824
Let loose

22:05.824 --> 22:09.161
- Loosey LaDuca is kind of
a mindfuck for me,

22:09.161 --> 22:11.630
because she's singing
about how to be loose

22:11.630 --> 22:14.600
but she's standing
as rigid as a dead fish.

22:14.600 --> 22:17.069
[singing]
- Let loose

22:17.069 --> 22:20.172
Baby, let loose

22:20.172 --> 22:22.274
Baby, let loose

22:22.274 --> 22:23.776
- Yas!
- Werk!

22:23.776 --> 22:26.345
[cheers and applause]

22:26.345 --> 22:28.614
- Marcia Marcia Marcia.

22:28.614 --> 22:31.016
[singing]
- Close your eyes

22:31.016 --> 22:33.552
Make a wish

22:33.552 --> 22:38.624
And blow out
the candlelight

22:38.624 --> 22:40.526
For tonight

22:40.526 --> 22:43.229
Is just your night

22:43.229 --> 22:45.864
We're gonna celebrate

22:45.864 --> 22:46.999
- [laughs]

22:46.999 --> 22:48.867
[singing]
- All through the night

22:48.867 --> 22:51.136
[singing]
- Pour the wine

22:51.136 --> 22:53.739
Light the fire
- Twirl, girl!

22:53.739 --> 22:55.608
[singing]
- Girl, your wish

22:55.608 --> 22:58.377
Is my command
- Oh, wow!

22:58.377 --> 23:01.747
[singing]
- I will do anything

23:01.747 --> 23:03.849
Girl, you need only ask

23:03.849 --> 23:06.385
[singing]
all: I'll make love to you

23:06.385 --> 23:08.954
Like you want me to

23:08.954 --> 23:11.757
And I'll hold you tight

23:11.757 --> 23:13.859
- This is genius.

23:13.859 --> 23:16.895
It's so campy.
It's so funny.

23:16.895 --> 23:18.664
You go, Marcia.

23:18.664 --> 23:21.834
[singing]
all: And I will not let go

23:21.834 --> 23:24.970
Till you tell me to
- Yas!

23:24.970 --> 23:28.574
[singing]
- Girl, relax

23:28.574 --> 23:31.010
[laughter]

23:31.010 --> 23:32.745
[cheers and applause]

23:32.745 --> 23:36.482
- Here to let you have it,
The Robin Fierce.

23:36.482 --> 23:40.352
[singing]
- Yeah, yeah

23:40.352 --> 23:42.788
[singing]
all: Now that we found love

23:42.788 --> 23:44.523
What are we gonna do?

23:44.523 --> 23:47.960
[singing]
- What are we gonna do with it?

23:47.960 --> 23:49.194
[singing]
- One, two

23:49.194 --> 23:50.729
Tell me what you got
- Yas, girl!

23:50.729 --> 23:51.730
[singing]
- Let me slip my quarters inside
your slot

23:51.730 --> 23:53.165
To hit the jackpot

23:53.165 --> 23:54.733
Rev me up, rev me up,
my little buttercup

23:54.733 --> 23:56.368
We can tuck sheets,
snuggle up, and get stuck

23:56.368 --> 23:58.203
Believe it or not, here
comes a brother with glow

23:58.203 --> 23:59.672
A snugglin', bubblin',
overweight

23:59.672 --> 24:01.273
Lovin' huggin' pro,
so what's it gonna be?

24:01.273 --> 24:03.275
Me or the TV?
Let me take time

24:03.275 --> 24:04.476
To set your mind
and your body

24:04.476 --> 24:06.378
Lover my lady
- Yas, girl!

24:06.378 --> 24:07.246
[singing]
- Spread your wings

24:07.246 --> 24:08.247

So we can fly around the world

24:08.247 --> 24:10.349
Harmony, charm of me, your
fingertips are calmin' me

24:10.349 --> 24:11.617

24:16.422 --> 24:18.190
Blessin' like Buddha,
Buddha as the bless

24:18.190 --> 24:19.258
You can lay down

24:19.258 --> 24:20.526
Put your head on my chest

24:20.526 --> 24:22.728

24:40.713 --> 24:43.916
- Next up,
it's Irene Dubois.

24:43.916 --> 24:45.651
- Hi there.

24:45.651 --> 24:48.954
Irene Dubois here
with a fun, little tutorial.

24:48.954 --> 24:51.523
Today, we're gonna be making
one of my favorite recipes,

24:51.523 --> 24:53.792
a glass of ice-cold water.

24:53.792 --> 24:55.194
Let's get started.

24:55.194 --> 24:57.363
First, you're gonna want
to pour yourself

24:57.363 --> 24:59.698
two cups of water
into a glass.

24:59.698 --> 25:02.501
[upbeat music]

25:11.643 --> 25:13.145
See how easy that is?

25:13.145 --> 25:15.514
All right, next up,
we're just gonna take some ice.

25:15.514 --> 25:17.282
And we...

25:17.282 --> 25:18.751
You just get a little ice.

25:18.751 --> 25:19.752
And you...

25:19.752 --> 25:20.953
Give it!

25:20.953 --> 25:23.355
Just put some ice
right into the glass.

25:23.355 --> 25:24.790
[music stops]

25:27.192 --> 25:29.928
- No one's laughing.

25:29.928 --> 25:31.930
Absolutely no one.

25:31.930 --> 25:34.833
The only thing that's
making noise is the ice cubes.

25:34.833 --> 25:37.136
- All right,
and last but not least,

25:37.136 --> 25:39.338
we're gonna take
a little slice of lemon.

25:39.338 --> 25:42.007
We're gonna squeeze a few drops
into the glass.

25:42.007 --> 25:44.476
And then we're gonna put it
right on the edge of--

25:44.476 --> 25:45.811
right into the glass.

25:45.811 --> 25:48.647
All right,
let's try it out.

25:48.647 --> 25:50.449
- This had so much potential.

25:50.449 --> 25:53.218
It doesn't have to be this...

25:53.218 --> 25:56.722
no pun intended, dry.

25:56.722 --> 25:59.124
- Mmm, so good.

26:09.968 --> 26:11.437
- I'm cringing for Irene

26:11.437 --> 26:15.541
because I can feel the
whole room just staring at her.

26:15.541 --> 26:17.409
The judges are not
feeling the number,

26:17.409 --> 26:19.144
and I'm kind of scared
for my girl.

26:19.144 --> 26:22.114
[tense music]

26:22.114 --> 26:25.184

26:35.360 --> 26:37.996
Six letters and three vowels.

26:37.996 --> 26:39.898
My name is Anetra,
ladies and gentlemen,

26:39.898 --> 26:42.901
and I'm here
to wear your pussies out!

26:42.901 --> 26:44.603
- Whoo!

26:44.603 --> 26:46.538

Walk that fucking duck!

27:06.859 --> 27:08.494
Guys, do you smell that?

27:08.494 --> 27:10.095
It's like something's burning.

27:10.095 --> 27:12.931
Is that my pussy?

27:12.931 --> 27:14.166
Yes.
[cracks board]

27:14.166 --> 27:15.934
[cheers and applause]
It is.

27:15.934 --> 27:18.837
- Shut up!
- It's burning!

27:18.837 --> 27:20.405
Oh, my God, it's on fire.
It's, like, burning out.

27:20.405 --> 27:22.541
Wait, there we go.
[cracks board]

27:22.541 --> 27:25.244
There's nothing like
a fire extinguisher.

27:25.244 --> 27:26.912
- Ah!
- Wow!

27:26.912 --> 27:28.113

27:32.651 --> 27:35.153

for the quiet ones, you know?

27:35.153 --> 27:36.655
You never know
what they have up their sleeve.

27:36.655 --> 27:39.558
- You better walk
that fucking duck!

27:39.558 --> 27:41.026
- Yas!
- Shut up!

27:41.026 --> 27:42.094
- Ah!
- Damn!

27:42.094 --> 27:44.763
[cheers and applause]

27:44.763 --> 27:47.966
- It's time

27:47.966 --> 27:49.535
[singing]

27:49.535 --> 27:51.637
Wh-wh-wh-where, where,

Sugar babies at?
Sugar babies at?

27:55.440 --> 27:57.042
Shh, it's Sugar.

27:57.042 --> 27:58.844
Bubblegum,
bubblegum in a dish

27:58.844 --> 28:00.779
If you wanna get with Sugar,
then you better make a wish

28:00.779 --> 28:02.548
Genie in a bottle,
Xtina's my girl

28:02.548 --> 28:04.550
Make a viral video

28:04.550 --> 28:06.251
I'm from TikTok,

28:06.251 --> 28:08.186
Like Tyra Banks,
the bitch on my side

28:08.186 --> 28:09.054
[singing]
- Tucked, a French tip

28:09.054 --> 28:09.955
Blonde hair, and a curl

28:09.955 --> 28:11.957
One-inch heels,
ugh, make me wanna hurl

28:11.957 --> 28:13.458
All you girl,

28:13.458 --> 28:15.427

28:15.427 --> 28:17.329
Bimbofied,

28:26.405 --> 28:28.473
He d-d-d-d-d-d-dies

28:28.473 --> 28:30.075
Just kidding,

28:30.075 --> 28:32.144
We're pretty kittycats
until the sun rise

28:32.144 --> 28:33.679
A scoop, a coupe,
and a spoonful of Sugar

28:33.679 --> 28:35.681
But do your research,
I was never a booger

28:35.681 --> 28:37.215
So pick your nose
before you pick on me

28:37.215 --> 28:39.117
And if you suck a D,
never do it for free

28:39.117 --> 28:40.953
Unless he's hot,
then he can holler at me

28:40.953 --> 28:42.955
Now you might be shocked,
this bimbo got vibes

28:42.955 --> 28:45.490
Check the writing credits,

28:54.666 --> 28:56.668

hell is going on here?

29:19.891 --> 29:21.126
[singing]

29:21.126 --> 29:23.261

29:47.352 --> 29:49.354
For we're, oh, so blessed

29:49.354 --> 29:50.989
[singing]
- My life is meaningless

29:50.989 --> 29:52.758

Why he's gone away

32:27.612 --> 32:30.916
And I don't know
where he can be

32:30.916 --> 32:32.617
My baby

32:32.617 --> 32:33.852
Ooh!

32:33.852 --> 32:35.053
- [laughs]
- Yas!

32:35.053 --> 32:37.088
- Whoo!
- Whoo! Yeah!

32:37.088 --> 32:38.723
[laughter and applause]

32:38.723 --> 32:42.561
- Give it up for Aura Mayari.

32:42.561 --> 32:44.496
[singing]
all: Let's kill this love

32:46.097 --> 32:47.766
[singing]
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

32:49.935 --> 32:52.003
[singing]
- Rum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum,
pum

32:53.438 --> 32:57.342
[singing] all: Let's kill this
love
- Yeah!

32:57.342 --> 32:59.244
[singing]
- Rum, pum, pum, pum, pum, pum,
pum

33:05.050 --> 33:06.785
[music swells]

33:06.785 --> 33:08.887
[singing]
- We all commit to love

33:08.887 --> 33:12.390
That makes you cry

33:12.390 --> 33:13.725
Oh, oh

33:13.725 --> 33:15.627
We're all making love

33:15.627 --> 33:19.664
That kills you inside,
yeah

33:19.664 --> 33:21.700
[singing]
all: We must kill this love

33:21.700 --> 33:23.468
Yeah, it's sad but true

33:23.468 --> 33:27.639
Gotta kill this love
before it kills you too

33:27.639 --> 33:30.876
Kill this love,
yeah, it's sad but true

33:30.876 --> 33:33.578
Gotta kill this love,
gotta kill

33:33.578 --> 33:36.514
Let's kill this love

33:36.514 --> 33:38.183
- Werk!

33:38.183 --> 33:41.720
[cheers and applause]

33:41.720 --> 33:44.489
- It's Sasha Colby.

33:46.324 --> 33:50.996
[singing]
- Another head hangs lowly

33:50.996 --> 33:56.034
Child is slowly taken

33:57.636 --> 34:02.941
And the violence
caused such silence

34:02.941 --> 34:07.746
Who are we mistaken?

34:07.746 --> 34:10.715
But you see,
it's not me

34:10.715 --> 34:13.385
It's not my family

34:13.385 --> 34:16.655
In your head,
in your head

34:16.655 --> 34:19.691
They are dying

34:19.691 --> 34:21.293
In your head

34:21.293 --> 34:23.762
- I'm just living for Sasha.

34:23.762 --> 34:26.598
She is so engaging
and beautiful

34:26.598 --> 34:29.401
but also not afraid
to get gritty with it.

34:30.735 --> 34:32.270
[singing]
- What's in your head?

34:32.270 --> 34:34.039
- Werk!

34:34.039 --> 34:36.541
[singing]
- In your head

34:36.541 --> 34:39.344
Zombie, zombie

34:39.344 --> 34:43.048
Zombie-ie-ie, oh

34:44.582 --> 34:45.684
- Werk.

34:45.684 --> 34:48.954
[cheers and applause]

34:48.954 --> 34:53.058
- Last but not least,
here's Jax.

34:54.492 --> 34:56.361
[singing]
- Brushed my hair, went
downstairs

34:56.361 --> 34:58.163
Favorite jeans on my rear

34:58.163 --> 34:59.998
And I looked up
in my mirror

34:59.998 --> 35:01.833
And I said,
who's that there?

35:01.833 --> 35:03.702
Who's that there
in that mirror?

35:03.702 --> 35:05.503
I don't care
if they're aware

35:05.503 --> 35:07.539
Now I see
just why they stare

35:07.539 --> 35:09.274
I just pay them,
I don't care

35:09.274 --> 35:11.810
I know,
so what I got a attitude?

35:11.810 --> 35:12.677
- Werk!

35:12.677 --> 35:14.112
[singing]
- Bitch, I got a attitude

35:14.112 --> 35:15.647
I'm gonna have a attitude

35:15.647 --> 35:17.248
- No way!
[singing] - Bitch, I got a
attitude

35:17.248 --> 35:18.717
- You better werk!
[singing] - Attitude, attitude

35:18.717 --> 35:20.485
Attitude, attitude,
attitude, attitude

35:20.485 --> 35:21.953
Attitude, attitude

35:21.953 --> 35:23.655
Attitude, attitude,
attitude, attitude

35:23.655 --> 35:25.223
Attitude, attitude
- Oh, my God.

35:25.223 --> 35:27.325
[singing]
- When they ask me where I've
been

35:27.325 --> 35:28.860
Busy
- Yas, bitch!

35:28.860 --> 35:30.729
[singing]
- When they ask me where I live

35:30.729 --> 35:32.230
The city, the city

35:32.230 --> 35:33.698
I don't own a welcome mat

35:33.698 --> 35:35.867
Give me the proper feet
to stand back

35:35.867 --> 35:37.602
I don't own a welcome mat
- Yas!

35:37.602 --> 35:39.237
[singing]
- Give me the proper feet to
stand back

35:39.237 --> 35:41.239
Attitude, attitude,
attitude, attitude

35:41.239 --> 35:42.874
Attitude, attitude,
attitude, stand back

35:42.874 --> 35:44.843
Attitude, attitude,
attitude, attitude

35:44.843 --> 35:46.811
Attitude, attitude,
attitude, stand back

35:46.811 --> 35:48.580
Attitude, attitude,
attitude, attitude

35:48.580 --> 35:50.415
Attitude,
attitude, attitude

35:50.415 --> 35:52.150
Attitude, attitude
- The fuck?

35:52.150 --> 35:54.786
[singing]
- Attitude, attitude, attitude,
what?

35:54.786 --> 35:58.323
[cheers and applause]

35:58.323 --> 36:01.426
- This bitch just did
a triple-double whatever it is

36:01.426 --> 36:04.129
and lands on her titties?

36:04.129 --> 36:05.730
Ever so gently?

36:05.730 --> 36:08.299
- Whoo!
- Periodt!

36:08.299 --> 36:09.300
- Yas! Werk!

36:09.300 --> 36:11.236
- I'm actually so gagged.

36:11.236 --> 36:13.505
[dramatic music]

36:13.505 --> 36:15.440
[dramatic music]

36:15.440 --> 36:19.444
[singing]
- The world is your runway

36:19.444 --> 36:22.747
- Category is,
Who Is She?

36:22.747 --> 36:27.218
Up first, Irene Dubois.

36:27.218 --> 36:31.089
Ooh!
Oh, no, she better Dubois!

36:31.089 --> 36:33.958
- This is absolutely
a signature Irene Dubois look.

36:33.958 --> 36:37.362
It's inspired
by Giger and the Xenomorph

36:37.362 --> 36:38.730
from the "Alien" franchise.

36:38.730 --> 36:40.198
I'm gonna plant my baby
in you,

36:40.198 --> 36:41.633
and it's gonna burst out
of your chest.

36:41.633 --> 36:43.802
And give me your heart
so I can eat it!

36:43.802 --> 36:45.170
Nya, nya, nya, nya, nya!

36:45.170 --> 36:47.272
- When are they
bringing back the McRib?

36:47.272 --> 36:49.607
- [laughs]

36:49.607 --> 36:51.743
Luxx Noir London.

36:51.743 --> 36:56.014
Luxx Noir Paris,
Luxx Noir New York.

36:56.014 --> 36:57.682
- A quintessential Luxx look

36:57.682 --> 37:00.285
would be, like,
some sort of grand hat

37:00.285 --> 37:01.786
'cause I love a statement hat.

37:01.786 --> 37:02.987
Like,
people don't wear hats enough.

37:02.987 --> 37:04.456
Maybe people do
wear a lot of hats.

37:04.456 --> 37:06.324
I don't know.
I don't really pay attention.

37:06.324 --> 37:08.960
But definitely some color.

37:08.960 --> 37:10.228
I love to show body.

37:10.228 --> 37:12.764
I love to show shade.

37:12.764 --> 37:14.332
Fun colors.

37:14.332 --> 37:15.867
I think I said colors already,
didn't I?

37:15.867 --> 37:19.404
- I think you get free
satellite TV with this hat.

37:19.404 --> 37:21.906
- [laughs]

37:21.906 --> 37:23.641
Aura Mayari.

37:23.641 --> 37:26.211
Trend alert:
high-top ponytail.

37:26.211 --> 37:29.581
- Aura Mayari is
a moon goddess warrior,

37:29.581 --> 37:31.316
and I'm definitely
showing that

37:31.316 --> 37:35.854
with this all-black vinyl look
and my platinum ponytail.

37:35.854 --> 37:37.188
Michelle is looking at me,

37:37.188 --> 37:38.756
and she's like,
"Who is that bitch?

37:38.756 --> 37:40.758
She's fucking gorgeous."

37:40.758 --> 37:42.393
Maybe I'm just delusional.
[laughs]

37:42.393 --> 37:44.295
- "Why I Aura!"

37:44.295 --> 37:47.098
[laughter]

37:47.098 --> 37:49.868
- Marcia Marcia Marcia!

37:49.868 --> 37:51.269
- You know,
Mom always said,

37:51.269 --> 37:53.571
don't play with balls
in the house.

37:53.571 --> 37:55.039
- [laughs]

37:55.039 --> 37:58.643
- This beautiful
Chanel-inspired outfit

37:58.643 --> 38:03.581
represents my drag because
it is kind of preppy pastel.

38:03.581 --> 38:07.352
My references are like
Ariana Grande, Audrey Hepburn,

38:07.352 --> 38:10.555
and, like, Cher Horowitz,
like, mixed together.

38:10.555 --> 38:12.690
- Normally,
I'm not a fan of blue balls,

38:12.690 --> 38:14.926
but in this case,
I'll take them.

38:14.926 --> 38:16.194
[laughter]

38:16.194 --> 38:19.330
- Anetra.
- "What? I can't hear you.

38:19.330 --> 38:22.400
I have giant fucking spikes
in my ears."

38:22.400 --> 38:26.571
- I'm stopping this runway
in a custom Anetra original.

38:26.571 --> 38:28.940
Everything is handsewn
by your girl.

38:28.940 --> 38:30.742
We're giving you high future,

38:30.742 --> 38:34.145
crash landed from
the Planet Cunt in 3035.

38:34.145 --> 38:38.183
Left, right, left, right,
walking ducks left and right.

38:38.183 --> 38:40.118
- It's all water
off a duck's crack.

38:40.118 --> 38:41.286
- That's right.

38:41.286 --> 38:43.488
You better walk
that fucking duck.

38:43.488 --> 38:45.456
- Quack, quack!

38:45.456 --> 38:46.524
[laughter]

38:46.524 --> 38:49.694
- Malaysia Babydoll Foxx.

38:49.694 --> 38:52.997
All right, Patti LaBelle,
here's something else for you.

38:52.997 --> 38:57.001
- I'm wearing a fully
rhinestone white netted gown.

38:57.001 --> 38:59.003
I got my foxtails, baby,

38:59.003 --> 39:01.339
and that mean I got
a little change in the bank.

39:01.339 --> 39:02.640
Y'all eating it up, baby,

39:02.640 --> 39:04.809
'cause I'm giving
what needs to be given.

39:04.809 --> 39:07.111
- Why have seven rings
when you can have that one?

39:07.111 --> 39:08.513
[laughter]

39:08.513 --> 39:10.114
- Princess Poppy.

39:10.114 --> 39:12.550
- She's tulle for the summer.
- Mm.

39:12.550 --> 39:14.519
- I am the princess
of Candy Land.

39:14.519 --> 39:17.255
I am colorful, irreverent,

39:17.255 --> 39:21.159
and I am doing a pun
on rainbows and bows.

39:21.159 --> 39:23.861
I'm letting them see
all of this little tutu

39:23.861 --> 39:26.130
and just a little bit
of my asscrack.

39:26.130 --> 39:28.299
- Toot-toot. Hey!

39:28.299 --> 39:29.500
Beep, beep.

39:29.500 --> 39:30.868
- [laughs]

39:30.868 --> 39:33.404
- Sasha Colby from ColbyCo.

39:33.404 --> 39:36.040
- I'm fangirling so hard
right now.

39:36.040 --> 39:39.010
- I am giving you
quintessential Sasha Colby,

39:39.010 --> 39:41.579
wearing a gown
that I wore once ten years ago

39:41.579 --> 39:43.147
when I won Miss Continental.

39:43.147 --> 39:46.718
This look is screaming
unadulterated glamour,

39:46.718 --> 39:50.355
unapologetic fashion,
and most of all, art.

39:50.355 --> 39:51.556
Don't touch!

39:51.556 --> 39:53.825
- Gorgeous.

39:53.825 --> 39:55.326
- Ma'am, I can't see the movie.

39:55.326 --> 39:57.662
[laughter]

39:57.662 --> 39:59.497
- For your consideration...
- Yes?

39:59.497 --> 40:01.299
- Salina Estitties,

40:01.299 --> 40:03.501
or Salina STDs.

40:03.501 --> 40:05.503
[laughter]

40:05.503 --> 40:07.772
- This is
classic Estitties, OK?

40:07.772 --> 40:09.607
She is serving
West Coast chola.

40:09.607 --> 40:12.910
I'm in a full head-to-toe
denim look that I made myself.

40:12.910 --> 40:16.381
You know exactly who this girl
is the minute you see her.

40:16.381 --> 40:18.182
- You know,
she's got really good jeans.

40:18.182 --> 40:21.019
- [laughs]

40:21.019 --> 40:22.553
Amethyst.

40:22.553 --> 40:25.390
- Enema-thyst?
[laughter]

40:25.390 --> 40:29.827
- For this look I'm going with
a very slutty Bo Peep vibe.

40:29.827 --> 40:32.897
I think of myself
as a Disney teen

40:32.897 --> 40:34.265
that went off the deep end

40:34.265 --> 40:36.267
and, like,
wants to be naughty.

40:36.267 --> 40:38.236
I'm a Disney ho.

40:38.236 --> 40:40.972
- Uh, Chrissy,
where's Jack and Janet?

40:40.972 --> 40:42.573
- "At the Regal Beagle."

40:42.573 --> 40:45.977
Mr. Roper? I think
you mean Mr. Groper.

40:45.977 --> 40:47.578
[laughter]

40:47.578 --> 40:49.113
- Jax.

40:49.113 --> 40:53.184
Oh, the Fly Girl auditions
are next door.

40:53.184 --> 40:55.887
- I'm giving you OG Jax.
It is color-blocked.

40:55.887 --> 40:57.588
And I'm coming up out
of that bodega

40:57.588 --> 40:59.824
just rolling
through the East Village,

40:59.824 --> 41:02.527
stomping on some rats
in Tompkins Square Park,

41:02.527 --> 41:04.095
ready to serve it
on the runway.

41:04.095 --> 41:05.563
- You got some film
in that camera,

41:05.563 --> 41:06.731
or you just happy to see me?

41:06.731 --> 41:08.633
- Hey!

41:08.633 --> 41:10.535
- Loosey LaDuca.

41:10.535 --> 41:14.739
- I am serving an homage
to the holy spirit herself,

41:14.739 --> 41:16.908
Miss Britney Spears.

41:16.908 --> 41:19.977
- Check out
her overhead compartments.

41:19.977 --> 41:21.746
- You'll notice
my drag is always

41:21.746 --> 41:24.215
about the body-ody-ody.

41:24.215 --> 41:27.752
I'm trying to embody glamour
with a hint of camp--

41:27.752 --> 41:29.921
signature Loosey LaDuca.

41:29.921 --> 41:32.790
- "On this flight,
we only serve nuts."

41:32.790 --> 41:34.859
- [laughs]

41:34.859 --> 41:38.796
Mistress Isabelle Brooks.

41:38.796 --> 41:41.933
Oh,
there's a new sheriff in town.

41:41.933 --> 41:43.634
- [laughs]

41:43.634 --> 41:46.637
- I'm giving them a little
taste of Houston, Texas drag.

41:46.637 --> 41:48.840
Everything in Texas
is bigger and better.

41:48.840 --> 41:50.842
When we walk,
you're gonna hear the beads

41:50.842 --> 41:52.176
swishing against the floor.

41:52.176 --> 41:53.945
We're going to be
in the heaviest garments

41:53.945 --> 41:55.847
doing the most, honey.

41:55.847 --> 41:57.281
I didn't get this made
for the show.

41:57.281 --> 41:58.783
I pulled this out of my closet,

41:58.783 --> 42:01.219
so that's how you know a bitch
really got it going on.

42:01.219 --> 42:03.654
- I hear she has a huge lasso.

42:03.654 --> 42:04.956
- [laughs]

42:04.956 --> 42:07.892
The Robin Fierce.

42:07.892 --> 42:11.095
- She's got a bod for sin
but a head for donuts.

42:11.095 --> 42:12.764
- [laughs]

42:12.764 --> 42:15.133
- This is literally
the most beautiful

42:15.133 --> 42:18.202
that I have ever,
ever, ever felt.

42:18.202 --> 42:21.806
This look represents me because
it's glamorous and functional.

42:21.806 --> 42:23.674
Not only is she
the belle of the ball,

42:23.674 --> 42:25.943
she can get down
if she has to.

42:25.943 --> 42:28.346
- Business in the front
and whore in the back.

42:28.346 --> 42:30.515
[laughter]

42:30.515 --> 42:31.783
- Sugar.

42:31.783 --> 42:33.618
- Where's her beast?

42:33.618 --> 42:35.686
- [laughs]

42:35.686 --> 42:39.624
- I am in my full high-whore
princess drag fantasy.

42:39.624 --> 42:42.994
All of the references are
pulled from my childhood--

42:42.994 --> 42:45.296
my favorite pop stars
and movies.

42:45.296 --> 42:46.964
And that's the only reason
why I do drag,

42:46.964 --> 42:48.533
is to connect
with my inner self

42:48.533 --> 42:50.468
and be that little kid.

42:50.468 --> 42:53.504
- "My name is Belle.
I'm from Long Island.

42:53.504 --> 42:56.541
"I go to Roosevelt Field Mall.

42:56.541 --> 42:58.009
See you there."

42:58.009 --> 42:59.210
[laughter]

42:59.210 --> 43:00.445
- Spice.

43:00.445 --> 43:01.512
"- My name is Ariel.

43:01.512 --> 43:04.515
"You just met my sister, Belle.

43:04.515 --> 43:06.851
We hung out on Jones Beach
this summer."

43:06.851 --> 43:08.453
[laughter]

43:08.453 --> 43:11.622
- I'm giving you
Lecter edition Spice,

43:11.622 --> 43:14.192
channeling
my favorite princess ever.

43:14.192 --> 43:16.561
Red glitter lip
to match my red hair,

43:16.561 --> 43:20.064
and of course I have the high
slit up to the nether region.

43:20.064 --> 43:21.666
The coochie is
about to pop out.

43:21.666 --> 43:23.401
But hello,
it's Spice.

43:23.401 --> 43:25.069
That's always gonna happen.

43:25.069 --> 43:28.306
- Fashion alert:
fuzzy slits.

43:28.306 --> 43:30.308
[laughter]

43:30.308 --> 43:32.743
- Took you 15 seasons
to say fuzzy slits?

43:32.743 --> 43:35.313
[laughter]
I feel like--

43:35.313 --> 43:37.515
I'm quite sure
that was said once before.

43:37.515 --> 43:40.718
- It had to be.
Check the tape.

43:40.718 --> 43:42.153
- Welcome, queens.

43:42.153 --> 43:44.822
Based on your One Night Only
performances

43:44.822 --> 43:48.793
and your Who Is She?
runways presentations,

43:48.793 --> 43:50.294
I've made some decisions.

43:50.294 --> 43:51.996
[tense music]

43:51.996 --> 43:53.731
Luxx Noir London.

43:53.731 --> 43:55.500
Aura Mayari.

43:55.500 --> 43:58.236
Malaysia Babydoll Foxx.

43:58.236 --> 44:00.438
Princess Poppy.

44:00.438 --> 44:01.439
Sasha Colby.

44:01.439 --> 44:03.708
Salina Estitties.

44:03.708 --> 44:06.644
Mistress Isabelle Brooks.

44:06.644 --> 44:09.180
The Robin Fierce.

44:09.180 --> 44:10.381
Sugar.

44:10.381 --> 44:11.382
Spice.

44:11.382 --> 44:13.818
Ladies, you are...

44:13.818 --> 44:17.188
safe.

44:23.394 --> 44:25.696
Ladykins, you represent

44:25.696 --> 44:28.933
the tops and the bottoms
of the week.

44:28.933 --> 44:31.736
Now, it's time
for the judges' critiques.

44:31.736 --> 44:34.272
Up first,
Irene Dubois.

44:34.272 --> 44:35.506
- First of all,

44:35.506 --> 44:38.776
congrats to all of you
for that opening number.

44:38.776 --> 44:42.446
It looked so amazing,
so Miss America.

44:42.446 --> 44:44.382
I was living my fantasy.

44:44.382 --> 44:47.285
So brava to all of you.

44:47.285 --> 44:49.053
Hey, Irene.
- Hi, Michelle.

44:49.053 --> 44:52.189
- Your talent show, I was
excited about the storyline

44:52.189 --> 44:54.659
that you were giving us
with just the way you looked.

44:54.659 --> 44:56.694
I think the way you
paint yourself is beautiful.

44:56.694 --> 44:59.697
Where it fell short for me,
Irene, was it wasn't funny.

44:59.697 --> 45:01.232
- I liked where you were going.

45:01.232 --> 45:04.635
It just went from an H2-oh!,
to an H2-oh...

45:04.635 --> 45:06.103
- I wish that it had had

45:06.103 --> 45:08.372
a little bit more
of a punchline at the end.

45:08.372 --> 45:10.575
- But I love this runway look.
- Thank you so much.

45:10.575 --> 45:12.944
- I think it's very intricate,
and I'm into it.

45:12.944 --> 45:15.613
- Have you performed
the water bit before?

45:15.613 --> 45:18.115
- I have, and it is normally
a much longer bit.

45:18.115 --> 45:19.317
And I think compressing it,

45:19.317 --> 45:23.054
I chose some of the wrong beats
to mix.

45:23.054 --> 45:24.455
I think it was underwritten.

45:24.455 --> 45:26.390
- By an insurance company?

45:26.390 --> 45:28.926
- [laughs]
- Thank you.

45:28.926 --> 45:32.897
Up next,
Marcia Marcia Marcia.

45:32.897 --> 45:35.967
- Uh, stalker much?
- [laughs]

45:35.967 --> 45:38.235
- No, listen, I get it.
I want to fuck me too, OK?

45:38.235 --> 45:40.404
- Ah!
- I get it.

45:40.404 --> 45:42.239
I thought it was very sweet
and very brave of you.

45:42.239 --> 45:43.975
You speak for tens
of people out there

45:43.975 --> 45:45.443
who also want
to make out with me.

45:45.443 --> 45:48.980
- You were able to remain
in this goofy character

45:48.980 --> 45:52.249
and still deliver this
technically beautiful ballet.

45:52.249 --> 45:53.951
That's what a performer does.

45:53.951 --> 45:57.421
- You are
a very thoughtful artist.

45:57.421 --> 46:01.659
It was just super moving and
incredible in every capacity.

46:01.659 --> 46:03.094
- I think this is really fun,

46:03.094 --> 46:06.564
but you're wearing maybe
some Chapstick and mascara?

46:06.564 --> 46:08.633
- You got away with it tonight,

46:08.633 --> 46:10.735
but you're gonna
have to do more.

46:10.735 --> 46:12.303
- Gotcha.
And I will give that to you.

46:12.303 --> 46:14.038
- All right.
I will be looking.

46:14.038 --> 46:15.506
- [chuckles] Great.

46:15.506 --> 46:17.341
- Up next, Anetra.

46:17.341 --> 46:19.977
- Anetra, you better
walk that fucking duck.

46:19.977 --> 46:21.412
Your sense of drag,

46:21.412 --> 46:23.781
it's kind of like "Street
Fighter" meets ballroom.

46:23.781 --> 46:25.583
- The specificity
with your looks

46:25.583 --> 46:27.218
is so incredibly important.

46:27.218 --> 46:29.086
I feel like
I know you right away.

46:29.086 --> 46:30.921
- You counted
the letters in your name,

46:30.921 --> 46:32.757
and then told us
how many vowels were in it.

46:32.757 --> 46:35.359
[laughter]

46:35.359 --> 46:37.028
Like you're Vanna White.

46:37.028 --> 46:38.696
Thank you.
Good to know.

46:38.696 --> 46:40.498
- Immediately,
I know exactly who you are,

46:40.498 --> 46:43.200
and you're damn talented.
- Thank you.

46:43.200 --> 46:46.570
- I want to watch that number
on rewind

46:46.570 --> 46:49.006
over and over and over again.

46:49.006 --> 46:50.007
You just tore it up.

46:50.007 --> 46:51.442
And then,
you gave us something

46:51.442 --> 46:54.712
we didn't expect
with the kicks.

46:54.712 --> 46:57.081
Did you tell Bryce
that there's no way

46:57.081 --> 46:58.549
you're gonna hit his face?

46:58.549 --> 47:00.184
- We ran it a couple of times
just to make sure

47:00.184 --> 47:01.519
he was comfortable.
- Sure.

47:01.519 --> 47:04.088
- But I was a taekwondo
athlete for 14 years.

47:04.088 --> 47:07.191
- Wow. And when did you know
you could duck walk?

47:07.191 --> 47:08.192
- Just now.

47:08.192 --> 47:10.995
[laughter]

47:10.995 --> 47:12.129
- Just remember,

47:12.129 --> 47:14.832
you better walk
that fucking duck.

47:14.832 --> 47:16.701
Up next, Amethyst.

47:16.701 --> 47:19.270
- The idea with your number,

47:19.270 --> 47:22.173
it's actually a funny idea.

47:22.173 --> 47:23.641
You could have padded
a little bit

47:23.641 --> 47:25.076
to give us more drag with it.

47:25.076 --> 47:28.846
But I'm gonna tell you
the main thing that went wrong.

47:28.846 --> 47:31.882
We saw the baby way too fast.

47:31.882 --> 47:33.517
- I laughed
when the wine glass came out,

47:33.517 --> 47:35.252
and then I laughed
when I saw the baby.

47:35.252 --> 47:37.722
But unfortunately, there
was nowhere to go from there.

47:37.722 --> 47:39.824
- You should have kept that bun
in the oven until the end,

47:39.824 --> 47:42.693
because once the audience
gets ahead of you,

47:42.693 --> 47:44.495
you can't catch up.

47:44.495 --> 47:46.530
Tonight on the runway,
I think this is really cute!

47:46.530 --> 47:48.399
- Thank you.
- I like the extra bows.

47:48.399 --> 47:50.401
I love the pigtails.
I love a pigtail.

47:50.401 --> 47:52.870
- And tell me
about the no padding.

47:52.870 --> 47:55.506
What do you have
against Styrofoam rubber?

47:55.506 --> 47:57.041
- Nothing.
[laughter]

47:57.041 --> 48:01.112
But I do think I was blessed
with a nice body,

48:01.112 --> 48:02.780
so I would--
I like to show it off.

48:02.780 --> 48:04.415
- Well, no,
you should show it off,

48:04.415 --> 48:06.383
but if you had a big, fat ass,

48:06.383 --> 48:08.686
it would make your tiny waist
even better.

48:08.686 --> 48:10.654
- That's the misconception
of younger queens.

48:10.654 --> 48:12.189
They think padding takes away.

48:12.189 --> 48:16.327
Adding some hip and thigh will
just be like va-va-va-voom!

48:16.327 --> 48:17.394
- Yeah.
- All right.

48:17.394 --> 48:19.196
Up next, Jax.

48:19.196 --> 48:22.366
- This talent was
a total gamechanger.

48:22.366 --> 48:25.936
When it became clear to us that
your hair was the jump rope,

48:25.936 --> 48:28.239
something shifted
in the universe.

48:28.239 --> 48:32.777
Like, something major happened
in the cosmos.

48:32.777 --> 48:34.111
- One of my favorite moments

48:34.111 --> 48:36.213
was not
the four backflips you did.

48:36.213 --> 48:38.182
It was when you were
jump roping with your hair

48:38.182 --> 48:41.218
and you were rolling your eyes
like, "This is nothing."

48:41.218 --> 48:42.887
Who the fuck does that?

48:42.887 --> 48:44.121
- Me.

48:44.121 --> 48:45.956
- I imagine you're a gymnast.

48:45.956 --> 48:47.024
- I was
a competitive cheerleader.

48:47.024 --> 48:48.325
- Yeah, you were.
- Yeah.

48:48.325 --> 48:49.560
- And that's so smart,
whether it's taekwondo,

48:49.560 --> 48:50.694
whether it's ballet.

48:50.694 --> 48:52.630
That is
how you show us who you are

48:52.630 --> 48:53.931
at the beginning
of this competition.

48:53.931 --> 48:55.533
- I like your attitude.

48:55.533 --> 48:58.035
I like your look.
You are an around-the-way girl.

48:58.035 --> 49:00.671
You give me very '90s vibes,
which is fantastic.

49:00.671 --> 49:01.872
- I've said it for years:

49:01.872 --> 49:04.475
know who you are
and deliver it at all times.

49:04.475 --> 49:07.344
It was something
we did not expect at all.

49:07.344 --> 49:09.980
I mean, that's one
that I could watch on a loop

49:09.980 --> 49:12.049
all night long.

49:12.049 --> 49:14.585
Up next,
Loosey LaDuca.

49:14.585 --> 49:17.154
- Your body is so beautiful.

49:17.154 --> 49:19.523
You know exactly
how it should look.

49:19.523 --> 49:20.658
That's smart.

49:20.658 --> 49:22.493
Singing live,
on the other hand,

49:22.493 --> 49:23.761
wasn't that smart.

49:23.761 --> 49:26.096
You were doing
this whole '80s moment.

49:26.096 --> 49:29.733
And it almost needed for you
to lean into big movements,

49:29.733 --> 49:32.770
but because you were giving us
live vocals, it took it down.

49:32.770 --> 49:34.071
And it was like, oh, OK,

49:34.071 --> 49:35.739
she's doing step touch,
and she's doing this.

49:35.739 --> 49:37.174
- I do share similar concerns.

49:37.174 --> 49:39.376
If that was gonna be the
main thing of the performance,

49:39.376 --> 49:41.078
then I would love for it

49:41.078 --> 49:43.681
to have been
a slightly more perfect vocal.

49:43.681 --> 49:46.116
- I assumed
that singing live

49:46.116 --> 49:50.054
would really show a talent that
not everyone was going to show.

49:50.054 --> 49:53.958
And I took a risk and I, um...

49:53.958 --> 49:56.460
[sobbing]

49:56.460 --> 49:57.962
[somber music]

49:57.962 --> 50:01.732
I understand
that it didn't fully pay off,

50:01.732 --> 50:03.934
but I want you to know

50:03.934 --> 50:07.838
that I've been doing this
for a really long time.

50:07.838 --> 50:10.541
And I have a lot to show.

50:10.541 --> 50:12.643
And I know you like us padded,
but I don't pad.

50:12.643 --> 50:14.411
And I never will, OK?

50:14.411 --> 50:17.681
[laughter]

50:17.681 --> 50:20.117
- Thank you, ladies.
I think we've heard enough.

50:20.117 --> 50:22.019
While you untuck
in the Werk Room,

50:22.019 --> 50:24.221
the judges and I
will deliberate.

50:25.422 --> 50:27.958
Now,
just between us girlfriends,

50:27.958 --> 50:29.994
what do you think?

50:29.994 --> 50:34.198
And may I remind you,
somebody has gotta go home.

50:34.198 --> 50:37.134
Let's talk about Irene Dubois.

50:37.134 --> 50:39.103
- Irene Dubois is
a beautiful queen.

50:39.103 --> 50:41.805
She's a bit twisted, which we
could see in the talent show.

50:41.805 --> 50:44.408
- Well, a lot of show,
not so much talent, right?

50:44.408 --> 50:45.776
- Uh-huh.
- [laughs]

50:45.776 --> 50:48.913
- The idea of an act
that kind of mocks influencers

50:48.913 --> 50:51.315
and TikTok culture,
I think that's really smart.

50:51.315 --> 50:52.616
But it didn't land at all.

50:52.616 --> 50:54.451
And if you're gonna go comedy,
it has to land.

50:54.451 --> 50:57.354
- All right, let's move on down
to Marcia Marcia Marcia.

50:57.354 --> 50:58.756
- This queen is so smart.

50:58.756 --> 51:00.357
She pops!

51:00.357 --> 51:01.458
And I'm not just saying that

51:01.458 --> 51:02.660
'cause she has great taste
in men.

51:02.660 --> 51:04.061
You understand?
- [laughs]

51:04.061 --> 51:05.229
- It was funny.

51:05.229 --> 51:07.264
It was a full story.

51:07.264 --> 51:08.766
It showcased her talent.

51:08.766 --> 51:10.301
I think she's the full package.

51:10.301 --> 51:11.769
- Anetra.

51:11.769 --> 51:15.839
- You know, it was enough,
the dancing and the taekwondo.

51:15.839 --> 51:17.241
I would have been impressed
with that.

51:17.241 --> 51:19.276
And then, she changed
the whole motherducking game.

51:19.276 --> 51:20.978
- I want to come
to her show, you know?

51:20.978 --> 51:22.913
I think if I saw that
at a club or somewhere,

51:22.913 --> 51:24.815
I would pass out.
- I'm gonna say it.

51:24.815 --> 51:26.884
Anetra has quacked the code.

51:26.884 --> 51:28.986
- Shut up.
[laughter]

51:28.986 --> 51:30.821
- Up next,
we've got Amethyst.

51:30.821 --> 51:33.824
- So whereas we know
exactly what Marcia is

51:33.824 --> 51:35.859
and we know exactly
what Anetra is,

51:35.859 --> 51:38.963
we have no idea
who Amethyst is.

51:38.963 --> 51:41.065
- I can tell
that she's incredible.

51:41.065 --> 51:44.068
It's just a bummer that
it wasn't perfectly executed.

51:44.068 --> 51:45.769
- She could have actually
made that character

51:45.769 --> 51:47.037
more interesting.

51:47.037 --> 51:49.506
I want to see
a Beverly Hills housewife mom

51:49.506 --> 51:51.675
with leggings
and high-heeled shoes.

51:51.675 --> 51:54.144
I hate seeing flats
on this runway.

51:54.144 --> 51:56.080
- It wasn't necessary.
- Jax.

51:56.080 --> 51:59.116
- Jax skipped rope
with her hair.

51:59.116 --> 52:01.318
- You can't get any more drag
than that.

52:01.318 --> 52:05.122
- That kind of thinking is
my favorite kind of ridiculous.

52:05.122 --> 52:07.725
- Yeah,
she put everything into this--

52:07.725 --> 52:10.527
a little attitude, a little
around-the-way girl thing.

52:10.527 --> 52:13.063
I loved it.
Loosey LaDuca.

52:13.063 --> 52:15.366
- This really sucks
because I love Loosey.

52:15.366 --> 52:17.401
And I feel like this was--
oh, my God, "I Love Lucy."

52:17.401 --> 52:18.635
OK. Sorry.
- Oh, cute.

52:18.635 --> 52:19.870
- No, this is another case

52:19.870 --> 52:22.473
where execution just fell
to the back seat.

52:22.473 --> 52:23.674
And you can tell that

52:23.674 --> 52:26.010
there's this extraordinary
talent there.

52:26.010 --> 52:28.112
- Singing live was not
really an asset tonight

52:28.112 --> 52:30.014
because it wasn't
that kind of a song.

52:30.014 --> 52:31.148
And she was pitchy.

52:31.148 --> 52:33.050
- She is a fantastic queen.

52:33.050 --> 52:35.886
The problem is it just
wasn't memorable enough.

52:35.886 --> 52:38.088
- I took a Loosey LaDuca once.
- Did you?

52:38.088 --> 52:39.390
- Yeah,
it was her bad shrimp.

52:39.390 --> 52:42.092
[laughter]

52:42.092 --> 52:43.761
- All right, silence.
[claps]

52:43.761 --> 52:46.030
I've made my decision.

52:46.030 --> 52:48.265
Bring back my girls.

52:48.265 --> 52:50.367
Welcome back, ladies.

52:50.367 --> 52:51.735
I've made some decisions.

52:51.735 --> 52:53.804
[dramatic music]

52:53.804 --> 52:55.806
Marcia Marcia Marcia.

52:55.806 --> 52:59.410
You came here
with a crush on Ross.

52:59.410 --> 53:01.178
But after this week,

53:01.178 --> 53:03.847
we're obsessed with you.

53:03.847 --> 53:07.051
Anetra, bitch,
you are quackers.

53:07.051 --> 53:08.318
[laughter]

53:08.318 --> 53:10.354
Jax, tonight,

53:10.354 --> 53:13.157
you really
got this joint jumping.

53:14.625 --> 53:16.627
Anetra, condragulations.

53:16.627 --> 53:18.529
You are the winner
of this week's challenge.

53:18.529 --> 53:20.064
- Oh! Oh!

53:20.064 --> 53:23.267
- You've won a cash prize
of $5,000.

53:23.267 --> 53:26.470
- Ah!
[chuckles]

53:26.470 --> 53:28.472
I mean, thank you. Sorry.
[laughter]

53:28.472 --> 53:29.673
Winner, winner,

53:29.673 --> 53:32.209
I am a duckwalking
motherfucking winner.

53:32.209 --> 53:33.977
Baby, I'm about
to walk this duck

53:33.977 --> 53:37.314
all the way to the fucking
finale and get this crown.

53:37.314 --> 53:38.615
- Marcia and Jax,

53:38.615 --> 53:40.150
you are safe.

53:40.150 --> 53:41.385
You may join the other girls.

53:41.385 --> 53:42.986
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

53:42.986 --> 53:44.688
[applause]

53:44.688 --> 53:46.023
- Good job, girls.

53:51.161 --> 53:52.830
- Irene Dubois.

53:52.830 --> 53:56.533
Your performance
did not quench our thirst.

53:58.001 --> 53:59.470
Loosey LaDuca.

53:59.470 --> 54:01.638
You tried to let loose,

54:01.638 --> 54:04.374
but there was blockage.

54:06.043 --> 54:08.278
Amethyst, tonight,

54:08.278 --> 54:10.881
you prematurely e-joke-ulated.

54:16.220 --> 54:18.322
Loosey LaDuca,

54:18.322 --> 54:20.190
you're safe.

54:20.190 --> 54:22.726
- [sobbing]
Thank you so much.

54:22.726 --> 54:24.761
I'm not gonna
let you down again.

54:24.761 --> 54:27.131
And I promise
not to hold myself back.

54:27.131 --> 54:28.732
- You may join the other girls.

54:28.732 --> 54:29.967
- Thank you.

54:29.967 --> 54:32.703
[applause]

54:32.703 --> 54:34.538
- Irene Dubois.

54:34.538 --> 54:36.106
Amethyst.

54:36.106 --> 54:39.576
I'm sorry, my dears,
but you are up for elimination.

54:41.478 --> 54:43.180
- I'm devastated,

54:43.180 --> 54:46.383
but I'm absolutely
not going down without a fight.

54:47.651 --> 54:50.387
- Two queens stand before me.

54:50.387 --> 54:51.655
Prior to tonight,

54:51.655 --> 54:54.825
you were asked to prepare
a lip sync performance

54:54.825 --> 54:58.095
of "7 Rings"
by Ariana Grande.

54:58.095 --> 55:02.566
Ladies, this is
your last chance to impress me

55:02.566 --> 55:05.769
and save yourselves
from elimination!

55:07.604 --> 55:13.377
The time has come
for you to lip-synch

55:13.377 --> 55:16.580
for your life.

55:19.316 --> 55:22.452
- I learned the lyrics to
the song the day it came out.

55:22.452 --> 55:26.823
Uh, I'm quite the Ariana fan,
so I'm feeling really scared

55:26.823 --> 55:28.992
to lip synch her song
in front of her.

55:28.992 --> 55:32.429
But at the same time,
I'm here to fight.

55:32.429 --> 55:36.833
And I'm here to prove why I'm
America's next drag superstar.

55:36.833 --> 55:37.935
- Good luck.

55:37.935 --> 55:42.406
And don't fuck it erp.

55:42.406 --> 55:45.309
[Ariana Grande's "7 Rings"]

55:48.979 --> 55:50.614
[singing]
- Breakfast at Tiffany's

55:50.614 --> 55:52.716
And bottles of bubbles

55:52.716 --> 55:55.786
Girls with tattoos
who like getting in trouble

55:55.786 --> 55:59.489
Lashes and diamonds,
ATM machines

55:59.489 --> 56:02.826
Buy myself
all of my favorite things

56:02.826 --> 56:04.394
Been through some bad shit

56:04.394 --> 56:06.363
I should be a sad bitch

56:06.363 --> 56:09.933
Who would have thought
it'd turn me to a savage?

56:09.933 --> 56:13.170
Rather be tied up
with calls and not strings

56:13.170 --> 56:16.807
Write my own checks
like I write what I sing

56:16.807 --> 56:18.175
My wrist, stop watchin'
- Hey!

56:18.175 --> 56:19.743
[singing]
- My neck is flossy

56:19.743 --> 56:21.578
- Yas, girl.
[singing] - Make big deposits

56:21.578 --> 56:23.213
My gloss is poppin'

56:23.213 --> 56:24.848
You like my hair?

56:24.848 --> 56:26.683
Gee, thanks,
just bought it

56:26.683 --> 56:29.953
I see it, I like it,
I want it, I got it

56:29.953 --> 56:32.122
Yeah, I want it, I got it
- Hey!

56:32.122 --> 56:33.724
[singing] - I want it, I got it
- Werk!

56:33.724 --> 56:35.659
[singing]
- I want it, I got it

56:35.659 --> 56:38.695
Wearing a ring,
but ain't gon' be no "Mrs."

56:38.695 --> 56:41.531
- Irene and Amethyst are
lip-synching for their lives,

56:41.531 --> 56:44.201
the first official lip sync
of the season.

56:44.201 --> 56:46.970
And, baby, it's a close one.
It's a close one.

56:46.970 --> 56:50.173
[singing] - My smile is beamin'
- Wow! Hey!

56:50.173 --> 56:52.042

You've seen it.

56:53.877 --> 56:56.613
I see it, I like it,
I want it, I got it

56:56.613 --> 56:58.982
Yeah, my receipts be
lookin' like phone numbers

56:58.982 --> 57:00.751
If it ain't money,
then wrong number

57:00.751 --> 57:02.319
Black card is
my business card

57:02.319 --> 57:04.054
The way it settin' the tone
for me

57:04.054 --> 57:05.756
I don't mean to brag,
but I be like

57:05.756 --> 57:07.624
Put it in the bag, yeah
Hey!

57:07.624 --> 57:09.026
When you see them racks

57:09.026 --> 57:11.194
They stacked up like my ass,
yeah

57:11.194 --> 57:12.696
Shoot, go from the store
to the booth

57:12.696 --> 57:14.264
Make it all back
in one loop

57:14.264 --> 57:16.266
Give me the loot,
never mind, I got to juice

57:16.266 --> 57:17.567
Nothing but net
when we shoot

57:17.567 --> 57:19.169
Look at my neck,
look at my jet

57:19.169 --> 57:21.071
Ain't got enough money
to pay me respect

57:21.071 --> 57:22.673
Ain't no budget
when I'm on the set

57:22.673 --> 57:24.408
If I like it, then
that's what I get, yeah

57:24.408 --> 57:26.043
- Hey!
[singing] - I want it, I got it

57:26.043 --> 57:27.444

58:05.415 --> 58:07.851
And I promise I have
a lot more to show you.

58:09.353 --> 58:11.254
- You may join the other girls.

58:11.254 --> 58:12.489
- Thank you.

58:16.960 --> 58:18.962
- Irene Dubois.

58:18.962 --> 58:22.366
You may have been here
one night only,

58:22.366 --> 58:26.903
but you'll be in our hearts
forever and a day.

58:26.903 --> 58:29.940
Now, sashay away.

- Thank you all.

Well, I may not
have won the crown...

58:40.117 --> 58:43.320
[laughter]

58:47.657 --> 58:52.729
Being told to sashay away
is not a thrilling experience.

58:52.729 --> 58:55.432
I wasn't expecting
to go home first.

58:55.432 --> 58:58.435
I don't think it was
necessarily my time to go.

58:58.435 --> 59:00.537
But I won
the first mini challenge,

59:00.537 --> 59:02.239
so at least I won something.

59:02.239 --> 59:04.040
I wish that I could have
gotten to show the world

59:04.040 --> 59:06.843
a little bit more
of what I have to offer,

59:06.843 --> 59:10.781
but I'm very happy
with who I am.

59:10.781 --> 59:12.249
And I think
that despite the fact

59:12.249 --> 59:13.784
that I was only here
for a short time,

59:13.784 --> 59:14.885
that will still come through.

59:19.923 --> 59:22.125
- Condragulations, ladies.

59:22.125 --> 59:25.162
And remember,
if you can't love yourself,

59:25.162 --> 59:27.731
how in the hell you
gonna love somebody else?

59:27.731 --> 59:30.400
Can I get an amen up in here?
all: Amen!

59:30.400 --> 59:32.402
- All right,
now let the music play.

59:32.402 --> 59:34.971

- A little bit of love

to a brighter day

59:40.076 --> 59:41.478

59:46.116 --> 59:47.918
Next time on "RuPaul's Drag
Race"...

59:47.918 --> 59:49.719
I want you to sell us

59:49.719 --> 59:52.589
your vision
of the afterlife.

59:52.589 --> 59:54.090
- Keep your pills, poppers,

59:54.090 --> 59:55.959
and lackluster hookups
at the door.

- [laughs]

59:57.427 --> 59:59.296
- Where am I?

59:59.296 --> 1:00:01.298
- Oh, honey, you're--

1:00:01.298 --> 1:00:02.599
oh, I'm sorry.
[chuckles]

1:00:02.599 --> 1:00:04.835
[tense music]

1:00:04.835 --> 1:00:06.036
I just want to die.

1:00:07.137 --> 1:00:09.639
- I want all of it, OK?

1:00:09.639 --> 1:00:12.175
- I did not want
to go to that heaven.

1:00:12.175 --> 1:00:15.479
- I essentially had to write
the entire script myself.

1:00:15.479 --> 1:00:17.047
- I'm just not gonna, like...

1:00:20.584 --> 1:00:22.919

- A little bit of love

1:00:22.919 --> 1:00:25.489
Goes a long, long way

Lifting you up
to a brighter day

1:00:28.258 --> 1:00:30.627
A little bit of love

1:00:30.627 --> 1:00:33.129
Goes a long, long way

1:00:33.129 --> 1:00:35.799
Turn it around
when you up and say

1:00:35.799 --> 1:00:37.534
Everybody say love

1:00:37.534 --> 1:00:41.371
Love, love,
love, love, love

1:00:41.371 --> 1:00:45.675
Love, love, love,
love, love

1:00:45.675 --> 1:00:47.878
When you feel the love
