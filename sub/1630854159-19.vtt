00:02.209 --> 00:03.555
<i>Previously on "The Rookie."</i>

00:03.693 --> 00:06.075
I read my sister's case file.
My mom lied to me.

00:06.213 --> 00:07.800
<i>I'm here because
I have to do this.</i>

00:07.938 --> 00:10.251
Because what happened to me
was so awful

00:10.389 --> 00:12.012
I need to make sure it doesn't
happen to anyone else.

00:12.150 --> 00:13.703
Celina's mom had been
in a car accident.

00:13.841 --> 00:15.601
Her doctors prescribed opioids.

00:15.739 --> 00:17.914
On the day that your sister
was abducted,

00:18.052 --> 00:19.709
your mother was buying drugs.

00:19.847 --> 00:22.608
All these years, I mean,
do you have any idea

00:22.746 --> 00:24.300
how much I've blamed myself?

00:24.438 --> 00:26.509
Hey, you were just a kid.
It wasn't your fault.

00:26.647 --> 00:27.855
I know.

00:27.993 --> 00:28.890
It was hers.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.312
Oh, don't you look cozy!

00:36.450 --> 00:38.969
It's my day off
and I intend to relax.

00:39.108 --> 00:41.006
- You're going to relax?
- Oh, yeah.

00:41.144 --> 00:43.595
Okay, let me translate that
into Bailey.

00:43.733 --> 00:45.666
That means you're going to
teach four capoeira classes,

00:45.804 --> 00:47.564
do a 10-mile hike,
run for mayor?

00:47.702 --> 00:50.119
Excuse me, governor.

00:50.257 --> 00:52.673
No, I'm doing
absolutely nothing.

00:52.811 --> 00:54.226
- Okay.
- I'm serious.

00:54.364 --> 00:55.986
I'm gonna read trashy magazines

00:56.125 --> 00:58.230
and stream '90s sitcoms
and do nothing.

00:58.368 --> 01:00.508
I give the whole thing
20 minutes.

01:00.646 --> 01:02.165
I can do anything
I set my mind to,

01:02.303 --> 01:03.546
even nothing.

01:03.684 --> 01:05.099
You go, girl.

01:05.237 --> 01:06.411
It's supposed to be beautiful
this weekend.

01:06.549 --> 01:08.482
I was going to power wash
the outdoor furniture.

01:08.620 --> 01:10.691
Oh, I can do that.

01:10.829 --> 01:12.658
Oh, you're baiting me.
Nice try.

01:12.796 --> 01:14.833
I'm doing nothing today.
- Sure you are.

01:14.971 --> 01:16.938
Listen, if you change your mind
about the governorship,

01:17.077 --> 01:19.009
I'd be honored to be
your first gentleman.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.462
Governor Nune.

01:23.600 --> 01:25.602
<i>♪ Whoa, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh ♪</i>

01:25.740 --> 01:26.810
I kinda like it.

01:26.948 --> 01:29.054
<i>♪ I'm gonna win for you ♪</i>

01:29.192 --> 01:32.195
<i>♪ Like I know
you want me to do ♪</i>

01:40.307 --> 01:41.860
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:41.998 --> 01:43.551
When did you get in?

01:43.689 --> 01:45.760
Uh, depends.
What day is it?

01:45.898 --> 01:47.210
That bad, huh?

01:47.348 --> 01:49.557
Look, I'm--I'm 80% sure
it's--it's Thursday.

01:49.695 --> 01:51.973
It's Tuesday. Yeah.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.182
What were you guys
working on last night?

01:53.320 --> 01:55.045
Uh, murder suspect.
We were there all night.

01:55.184 --> 01:56.633
I stayed up anyways.

01:56.771 --> 01:58.808
Thought maybe I'd get lucky
and he'd turn himself in.

01:58.946 --> 02:01.190
Not quite.
Um, he did show up, though.

02:01.328 --> 02:03.364
- Hmm?
- Yeah.

02:03.502 --> 02:05.297
- Oh, babe.
- Yeah.

02:05.435 --> 02:07.851
Took on five metro officers?

02:07.989 --> 02:09.129
You gotta love that confidence.

02:09.267 --> 02:10.751
Yeah.

02:12.408 --> 02:14.962
What's all this?

02:15.100 --> 02:16.412
What?

02:16.550 --> 02:18.690
I'm studying for
the detective's exam.

02:18.828 --> 02:20.347
- Since when?
- I didn't tell you?

02:20.485 --> 02:22.211
I--no, I don't think so.

02:22.349 --> 02:23.833
If I'm gonna work undercover,

02:23.971 --> 02:26.353
the best move is to become
a detective in some division,

02:26.491 --> 02:28.700
like intelligence
or narcotics, right?

02:28.838 --> 02:30.219
Right.
So you got the tap.

02:30.357 --> 02:32.359
Harper and Lopez
are backing me.

02:32.497 --> 02:34.602
All I have to do is score
in the top 12, which--

02:34.740 --> 02:36.225
Which you will.

02:36.363 --> 02:37.398
Mm.

02:41.920 --> 02:44.164
Well, I guess
we should get used to

02:44.302 --> 02:45.682
not seeing each other so much.

02:45.820 --> 02:47.305
Mm, right.

02:47.443 --> 02:50.722
Yeah, between detective's hours
and metro hours...

02:50.860 --> 02:53.173
Hm. It's okay.

02:53.311 --> 02:54.864
We'll figure it out.

02:55.002 --> 02:56.900
Yeah, yeah.

03:00.180 --> 03:03.459
Hey, I'm sorry I haven't been
around as much lately.

03:03.597 --> 03:05.530
I've been busy.

03:05.668 --> 03:07.946
I actually started working on
your case.

03:11.121 --> 03:14.055
Well, I--I haven't made
much progress,

03:14.194 --> 03:18.715
unless destroying my
relationship with Mom counts.

03:18.853 --> 03:21.615
Look, I know you'd want me
to forgive her, but I--

03:21.753 --> 03:23.651
I--I don't--
I don't think I'm ready.

03:26.654 --> 03:29.450
Well, I gotta get to work.

03:35.076 --> 03:36.285
<i>Where's Celina?</i>

03:36.423 --> 03:37.941
Oh, she's visiting
her sister's grave.

03:38.079 --> 03:39.667
Today's the anniversary of
the day she was taken.

03:39.805 --> 03:41.393
I know. That's what I have to
talk to her about.

03:41.531 --> 03:43.050
I found two similar
kidnappings;

03:43.188 --> 03:44.569
one four years after Blanca

03:44.707 --> 03:46.260
and another seven years
after that.

03:46.398 --> 03:47.917
In every case, the victim was
six years old,

03:48.055 --> 03:49.367
taken while playing outside,

03:49.505 --> 03:51.507
and the parent has
a history of substance abuse.

03:51.645 --> 03:53.405
That sounds like
a serial killer.

03:53.543 --> 03:54.993
But why target the children
of drug addicts?

03:55.131 --> 03:56.339
I don't know.

03:56.477 --> 03:58.341
And every case happened on
the same day.

03:58.479 --> 04:00.101
Today?

04:00.240 --> 04:02.449
I'll handle it.
Thank you very much.

04:04.727 --> 04:06.522
Is that the sign-up list
for the detective's exam?

04:06.660 --> 04:08.489
It is. Two weeks to go.

04:08.627 --> 04:10.629
- I'll be ready.
- I have no doubt.

04:10.767 --> 04:13.218
Brave move, Chen.

04:14.978 --> 04:16.325
I don't know about that.

04:16.463 --> 04:18.050
I think it's the next step
for me.

04:18.188 --> 04:20.881
Sure, but you'll never make
top 12.

04:21.019 --> 04:22.538
What is that
supposed to mean?

04:22.676 --> 04:24.436
One of the detectives
has it out for you.

04:24.574 --> 04:26.335
So no matter how well you do
on the written,

04:26.473 --> 04:27.853
they're gonna sink you
on the oral.

04:27.991 --> 04:30.615
What? Who?

04:30.753 --> 04:32.133
I don't know.

04:32.272 --> 04:35.171
Good luck.

04:35.309 --> 04:37.967
- Is he right?
- Rarely.

04:38.105 --> 04:40.556
But I will ask around,
see if there's any truth to it.

04:40.694 --> 04:42.074
Thanks.

04:45.595 --> 04:47.287
<i>He abducted more kids?</i>

04:47.425 --> 04:48.702
<i>Two, that we know of.</i>

04:48.840 --> 04:50.566
And on the same day
as your sister.

04:50.704 --> 04:52.533
That's today.
Okay, that's creepy.

04:52.671 --> 04:54.052
So there could be another one today.

04:54.190 --> 04:55.364
Or not.

04:55.502 --> 04:57.745
Right.

04:57.883 --> 05:00.058
You know, I--I visited
her grave this morning,

05:00.196 --> 05:03.372
and she wasn't there.

05:03.510 --> 05:04.994
I know you think that's crazy.

05:05.132 --> 05:08.791
That aside, why do you think
she wasn't there?

05:08.929 --> 05:10.931
I don't know.

05:11.069 --> 05:13.554
But lately she's felt so, like,
far away.

05:13.692 --> 05:16.316
And I don't know
what's changed.

05:16.454 --> 05:18.663
<i>7-Adam-15,
we have a possible 207</i>

05:18.801 --> 05:21.286
<i>at 9215 Detroit Street.</i>

05:21.424 --> 05:23.426
- It's a kidnapping.
- Possible kidnapping.

05:23.564 --> 05:25.255
7-Adam-15, show us responding.

05:25.394 --> 05:27.775
I can take the lead on this.
- No, I'm good.

05:27.913 --> 05:29.018
You know,
when Blanca was taken,

05:29.156 --> 05:30.744
there were dozens of cops.

05:30.882 --> 05:32.262
And most of them were terrifying,

05:32.401 --> 05:34.920
but there was one that
made me feel like

05:35.058 --> 05:37.337
everything was going to be Okay.

05:37.475 --> 05:41.858
I want to be that person
for someone else.

05:43.032 --> 05:45.241
Maybe it's Carradine.

05:45.379 --> 05:47.795
I called him out for stealing
my lunches from the fridge.

05:47.933 --> 05:49.383
Okay, and you think
he's that petty?

05:49.521 --> 05:51.385
Maybe. I--

05:51.523 --> 05:53.214
Who do you think it is?
- I think,

05:53.353 --> 05:55.527
and stay with me on this one...
- Mm-hmm?

05:55.665 --> 05:58.358
Maybe you shouldn't believe
everything Smitty says

05:58.496 --> 06:00.429
or anything Smitty says.

06:00.567 --> 06:02.292
Yeah, but what if
he is right?

06:02.431 --> 06:04.743
The oral part of the exam is
so subjective.

06:04.881 --> 06:07.021
If even one person on the panel
has it out for me,

06:07.159 --> 06:08.540
it'll tank my score.

06:08.678 --> 06:11.163
Yeah, I never expected
a police station

06:11.301 --> 06:13.649
to be so much like high school.
- I know.

06:13.787 --> 06:16.652
Except, I mean,
now I'm one of the cool kids.

06:24.176 --> 06:26.247
It's him. It's the same guy.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.835
I don't--we don't know that.

06:27.973 --> 06:29.423
Most of the time
they're playing somewhere.

06:29.561 --> 06:30.907
We find them in minutes.
- No, that's not what this is.

06:31.045 --> 06:32.564
I can feel it.

06:32.702 --> 06:33.945
- Did you find her?
- No, ma'am.

06:34.083 --> 06:36.568
We have to find her!
She's six. She's scared.

06:36.706 --> 06:38.294
We know. That's why we're
here.

06:38.432 --> 06:39.916
We just need a few details.
- What details?

06:40.054 --> 06:41.677
My daughter is missing.
I said that on the phone!

06:41.815 --> 06:43.368
Okay, maybe you can
let us inside,

06:43.506 --> 06:44.507
and we can help you look.
- She's not inside.

06:44.645 --> 06:46.509
I looked.
She was playing outside.

06:46.647 --> 06:48.338
I--I heard a scream,
and she was gone.

06:48.477 --> 06:49.926
- You heard her scream?
- Yes.

06:50.064 --> 06:51.756
7-Adam-15.

06:51.894 --> 06:53.136
I need additional units
on my location.

06:53.274 --> 06:54.483
Notify search and rescue.

06:54.621 --> 06:55.518
What's he doing?
Is he calling someone?

06:55.656 --> 06:56.933
He's calling everyone.

06:57.071 --> 06:58.418
In ten minutes,
there will be dozens

06:58.556 --> 06:59.971
of police officers
and volunteers

07:00.109 --> 07:02.007
looking for your daughter.

07:02.145 --> 07:03.699
Olivia.

07:03.837 --> 07:04.769
Her name's Olivia.

07:04.907 --> 07:06.218
That's a really pretty name.

07:06.356 --> 07:08.669
How about I help you find
a photo of her?

07:08.807 --> 07:10.291
Yeah.

07:17.851 --> 07:19.439
We'll do two more of those,
at least by the next--

07:19.577 --> 07:21.441
- Nolan.
- Here we are.

07:21.579 --> 07:22.649
Any updates?

07:22.787 --> 07:24.202
We turned the house
upside down,

07:24.340 --> 07:25.859
checked the adjacent yards.
We're widening the search.

07:25.997 --> 07:27.447
- Security cameras?
- We got what we can.

07:27.585 --> 07:29.310
A lot of people aren't home.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.036
- It's him, isn't it?
- We don't know that.

07:31.174 --> 07:32.210
Look, we see the parallels,

07:32.348 --> 07:33.832
but you cannot leap
to conclusions.

07:33.970 --> 07:35.247
I mean, it's the anniversary.

07:35.385 --> 07:37.526
She's six years old,
taken from her front yard.

07:39.389 --> 07:41.875
What was that?

07:42.013 --> 07:43.255
I checked.

07:43.393 --> 07:45.395
Olivia's mother has
a history of drug abuse.

07:45.534 --> 07:47.639
Just like my mom. I mean,
just like the other victims.

07:55.371 --> 07:56.372
Well done. Just double back

07:56.510 --> 07:57.546
to check if anybody wasn't
home.

07:57.684 --> 07:58.408
We'll interview friends
and family.

07:58.547 --> 07:59.996
Okay.

08:00.134 --> 08:00.859
Oversee the canvass teams
and widen the perimeter.

08:00.997 --> 08:02.551
Hey.
How can we help?

08:02.689 --> 08:04.000
We need to comb through
the other cases,

08:04.138 --> 08:05.554
find any connections we can
between them.

08:05.692 --> 08:06.589
Any of the girls that
were taken,

08:06.727 --> 08:07.728
did any of them survive?

08:07.866 --> 08:09.454
No, all the girls were
found dead

08:09.592 --> 08:10.904
less than a month after
they disappeared,

08:11.042 --> 08:12.492
except Blanca,
who was found near death.

08:12.630 --> 08:13.769
What was different about her?

08:13.907 --> 08:15.391
Best guess,
she was the first.

08:15.529 --> 08:16.392
He didn't know
what he was doing.

08:16.530 --> 08:17.531
Well, he does now.

08:17.669 --> 08:18.946
He won't make that mistake again.

08:19.084 --> 08:22.087
You know your jobs.
Get it done.

08:22.225 --> 08:23.468
- Celina.
- Yeah.

08:23.606 --> 08:25.470
Hey, look, I just wanted
to say that

08:25.608 --> 08:27.368
I remember what it was like
to not know what happened

08:27.507 --> 08:29.716
to someone you love. I mean,
there were a bunch of times

08:29.854 --> 08:32.201
I thought we had a lead and
nothing ever panned out.

08:32.339 --> 08:33.651
So don't get my hopes up.

08:33.789 --> 08:36.446
Yeah, I guess that's what
I'm trying to say.

08:36.585 --> 08:38.932
Yeah, no. Thank you.
I gotta stay objective. Yeah.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.521
Anything south of
Hobart Street,

08:41.659 --> 08:42.798
you take it all the way down--

08:45.386 --> 08:47.181
Hang on a sec. You got that?

08:47.319 --> 08:49.529
Bailey.

08:49.667 --> 08:51.082
I know what I said
this morning,

08:51.220 --> 08:52.808
but I heard you needed more
bodies for the door to door.

08:52.946 --> 08:54.603
So here I am.
- I wasn't gonna say anything.

08:54.741 --> 08:56.087
I'm just going to check in
with the civilian team.

08:56.225 --> 08:57.226
Hey, what's on your hands?

08:57.364 --> 09:00.781
Uh... wood stain.

09:00.919 --> 09:02.990
Okay, so you went to power
wash the outdoor furniture--

09:03.128 --> 09:05.268
It just looked so bad
after all the rains

09:05.406 --> 09:06.822
that I had to sand it
and refinish it.

09:08.271 --> 09:10.101
- I tried to do nothing.
- Yeah, I know.

09:10.239 --> 09:12.310
It's important you tried.
- Yeah.

09:12.448 --> 09:14.588
- You're doing great.
- Okay.

09:14.726 --> 09:17.902
Yeah, I'll call you back.
All right, bye.

09:18.040 --> 09:19.835
Detective Dave Delgado.

09:19.973 --> 09:22.769
Sergeant Wade Grey.

09:22.907 --> 09:23.942
Man, thanks for coming down.

09:24.080 --> 09:26.013
Have a seat.
- Yeah, man.

09:26.151 --> 09:28.360
I heard you had a lead on
the Juarez case.

09:28.498 --> 09:30.466
I ran three red lights
getting over here.

09:30.604 --> 09:31.743
Well, I hope we didn't
waste your time.

09:31.881 --> 09:33.158
Eh, if I wasn't here,

09:33.296 --> 09:34.815
I'd be watching "Bosch"
in my underwear.

09:34.953 --> 09:37.680
Never retire.

09:37.818 --> 09:39.509
Look, we know everything
in the case file.

09:39.648 --> 09:42.167
What we need is
what's not in the file.

09:42.305 --> 09:44.756
Well, there was this one guy,

09:44.894 --> 09:46.620
Drew Heslov.

09:46.758 --> 09:48.553
Lived in the area,
didn't have an alibi.

09:48.691 --> 09:50.762
And he's a Megan's Law 290
sex offender.

09:50.900 --> 09:51.936
Not much to build
a case around.

09:52.074 --> 09:53.144
Exactly.

09:53.282 --> 09:55.318
But I interviewed him.
Real creep.

09:55.456 --> 09:57.010
Felt like he was enjoying
the whole thing.

09:57.148 --> 09:58.045
All right,
we'll check him out.

09:58.183 --> 09:59.840
I hear the, uh--

09:59.978 --> 10:01.014
the sister's a rookie here.

10:01.152 --> 10:02.843
She is.

10:02.981 --> 10:04.431
She'll make a good detective
one day.

10:04.569 --> 10:05.846
She has great instincts.

10:05.984 --> 10:08.469
Yeah, well, she came by them
the hard way.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.713
Something like that
happens when you're a kid,

10:10.851 --> 10:13.336
changes the way
you see the world.

10:13.474 --> 10:15.373
Yeah.

10:20.343 --> 10:23.864
<i>Celina, vamos!</i>

10:24.002 --> 10:25.901
<i>Celina!</i>

10:26.039 --> 10:28.213
Celina.

10:28.351 --> 10:30.975
Officer Chambers! Hey!

10:31.113 --> 10:32.873
I thought I might see you at
the cemetery this morning.

10:33.011 --> 10:34.426
Well, I--
I must have missed you.

10:34.564 --> 10:36.325
You know, I saw the picture
of your graduation.

10:36.463 --> 10:39.052
But it's a whole other thing
in person.

10:39.190 --> 10:40.363
I'm so proud of you.

10:40.501 --> 10:43.573
Thank you.

10:43.712 --> 10:46.059
There's someone
I want you to meet.

10:46.197 --> 10:48.924
This is my TO, John Nolan.

10:49.062 --> 10:50.995
This is Officer Joel Chambers.

10:51.133 --> 10:52.582
- Pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

10:52.721 --> 10:55.862
Yeah, Joel's one of the cops
who helped look for Blanca.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.415
Joel Chambers.

10:57.553 --> 10:58.865
Thank you, sir.

10:59.003 --> 11:00.349
I don't remember seeing
your name on the report.

11:00.487 --> 11:01.937
Yeah, we've been going over
the case file.

11:02.075 --> 11:04.802
I--I didn't, uh,
write a Form 3.

11:04.940 --> 11:06.217
In a case like this,
everyone just pitches in.

11:06.355 --> 11:07.908
Right.

11:08.046 --> 11:09.669
Now, when we found her,
when she was in the hospital,

11:09.807 --> 11:12.257
Joel visited every day.

11:12.395 --> 11:14.604
I have something.

11:14.743 --> 11:16.745
It's a shoe print.
- Excuse me.

11:20.507 --> 11:21.957
Can I offer a hand?
- Oh, sorry.

11:22.095 --> 11:23.924
I can't let anyone inside
without detective approval.

11:24.062 --> 11:25.615
I--I promise
I know better than to

11:25.754 --> 11:28.273
contaminate a crime scene.

11:28.411 --> 11:30.413
- Rules are rules.
- Of course.

11:31.483 --> 11:32.657
She's a good kid.

11:38.076 --> 11:39.595
Smitty, what's up?

11:39.733 --> 11:42.149
I don't want you to worry
about the detective's exam.

11:42.287 --> 11:44.048
I'm on it.
- Wait, what?

11:44.186 --> 11:45.601
- Leave it to Smitty.
- No, Smitty.

11:45.739 --> 11:47.361
Please don't--

11:47.499 --> 11:49.294
God.

11:49.432 --> 11:50.813
He hung up.

11:50.951 --> 11:52.781
So you won't be
making detective.

11:52.919 --> 11:54.955
But, um, there's other
career paths, right?

11:57.958 --> 11:59.373
This the guy that
Delgado mentioned?

11:59.511 --> 12:01.237
Yeah, Drew Heslov.

12:01.375 --> 12:02.618
Back in the aughts he did
five years for

12:02.756 --> 12:03.964
lewd acts with a minor.

12:04.102 --> 12:05.863
He's been on probation
ever since.

12:06.001 --> 12:08.520
We are less than a mile
from Olivia's house.

12:13.042 --> 12:14.319
- Officers.
- Can we come in?

12:14.457 --> 12:15.907
We both know
I can't stop you.

12:16.045 --> 12:17.944
Mm-hmm.

12:19.669 --> 12:21.326
Where were you between 10:00
and 11:00 this morning?

12:21.464 --> 12:22.672
Why?
What happened?

12:22.811 --> 12:23.812
Sir, just answer
the question.

12:23.950 --> 12:25.399
I was here.

12:25.537 --> 12:26.918
Alone?

12:27.056 --> 12:29.507
Yeah.

12:29.645 --> 12:30.991
Move aside.

12:37.860 --> 12:38.930
That's a gift.

12:39.068 --> 12:40.483
Really? For who?

12:40.621 --> 12:41.484
One of my nieces.

12:41.622 --> 12:42.831
You don't have any nieces.

12:42.969 --> 12:44.936
I like dolls.
That's not a crime.

12:45.074 --> 12:46.489
Per the terms of
your probation,

12:46.627 --> 12:47.939
you're not allowed to own
children's toys.

12:48.077 --> 12:49.147
This is harassment!

12:49.285 --> 12:50.148
I think you two should leave.

12:50.286 --> 12:52.357
Sit down.

12:52.495 --> 12:53.876
Now.

12:54.014 --> 12:56.120
Do not move,
do not touch anything,

12:56.258 --> 12:59.779
or you will be in violation of
your probation.

12:59.917 --> 13:01.125
7-Adam-7.

13:01.263 --> 13:04.542
We need additional units
to 7858 West Cedar.

13:07.200 --> 13:08.235
Detectives.

13:08.373 --> 13:09.547
You have a minute?
- What's up?

13:09.685 --> 13:11.135
Earlier today,
an officer dropped by.

13:11.273 --> 13:13.137
He worked Blanca's case
back in the day.

13:13.275 --> 13:15.380
According to Celina,
he visited constantly.

13:15.518 --> 13:17.210
- A little overinvolved?
- Maybe.

13:17.348 --> 13:19.246
And today,
he tried to get inside

13:19.384 --> 13:21.145
the crime scene's
inner perimeter.

13:21.283 --> 13:23.043
Maybe these kinds of cases
hit home for him

13:23.181 --> 13:24.424
and he wants to help.

13:24.562 --> 13:26.357
Or maybe he wanted
an excuse for his DNA

13:26.495 --> 13:28.048
to be at the scene.

13:28.186 --> 13:29.670
I looked into him.
He had a daughter,

13:29.809 --> 13:31.707
lost custody of her
when she was six years old.

13:31.845 --> 13:33.226
The same age as
the missing girls.

13:33.364 --> 13:35.745
And today was
his daughter's birthday.

13:40.060 --> 13:41.234
Look, I know it's not
a slam dunk, but I think

13:41.372 --> 13:43.615
it deserves a closer look.
Nolan is right.

13:43.753 --> 13:45.548
There's something off
about Officer Chambers.

13:45.686 --> 13:46.756
How do you want to proceed?

13:46.895 --> 13:48.068
Joel's been on duty
all morning.

13:48.206 --> 13:49.518
We want to check
his shop's GPS,

13:49.656 --> 13:51.244
see if he went anywhere
near her house.

13:51.382 --> 13:52.935
He has a history with
Olivia's family.

13:53.073 --> 13:54.799
I can bring him in
under the guise of

13:54.937 --> 13:56.766
needing background intel.
<i>- Good.</i>

13:56.905 --> 13:58.768
The minute he realizes
he's a suspect,

13:58.907 --> 14:00.632
he'll ask for his reps
and shut down.

14:00.770 --> 14:02.082
Lucy and Aaron
have a new suspect.

14:02.220 --> 14:03.877
I'll check in with them
and report back.

14:04.015 --> 14:05.051
All right. Keep me posted.

14:08.157 --> 14:09.745
Do you see that?

14:09.883 --> 14:12.368
Harper and Lopez are making
secret calls in their car.

14:12.506 --> 14:15.095
They'll update us when
they get something concrete.

14:15.233 --> 14:16.269
You know what's going on.

14:16.407 --> 14:17.546
If you're keeping
something from me

14:17.684 --> 14:19.444
because you think
I'm too close to the case,

14:19.582 --> 14:21.274
please don't.

14:23.172 --> 14:24.760
How well do you know Joel?

14:24.898 --> 14:26.796
Yeah, we've kept in touch.
Why?

14:26.935 --> 14:28.453
Does he ever talk about
his daughter,

14:28.591 --> 14:30.041
the one he lost custody of
when she was six?

14:30.179 --> 14:33.769
No.

14:33.907 --> 14:36.289
Wait. You--you don't--

14:36.427 --> 14:37.497
you don't think he did this?

14:37.635 --> 14:40.155
Did you know today is
her birthday?

14:40.293 --> 14:42.157
So you think--what,

14:42.295 --> 14:45.954
he just takes these girls
to replace her?

14:46.092 --> 14:47.576
Maybe. It's a theory.

14:47.714 --> 14:49.336
No, it's a coincidence.

14:49.474 --> 14:50.510
Maybe that's why
he gets involved,

14:50.648 --> 14:52.098
because it reminds him of her.

14:52.236 --> 14:54.272
Okay, I know this is hard
for you to hear--

14:54.410 --> 14:55.998
Hard to hear?

14:56.136 --> 14:58.656
He's the reason I'm a cop--
because of him.

14:58.794 --> 15:02.004
Listen, you're wrong,
and he didn't do this.

15:09.460 --> 15:11.151
- Find anything?
- No sign of Olivia.

15:11.289 --> 15:12.601
He could have built
all sorts of hidden areas

15:12.739 --> 15:14.154
over the years.
We need dogs and infrared.

15:14.292 --> 15:15.845
Already requested.

15:17.744 --> 15:20.126
Mr. Heslov,
I'm Detective Lopez.

15:20.264 --> 15:22.507
Does the name Olivia Vargas
mean anything to you?

15:22.645 --> 15:24.993
That's what all this
is about?

15:25.131 --> 15:25.959
You think I did
something to her?

15:26.097 --> 15:26.995
Answer the question.

15:27.133 --> 15:29.135
Have you ever met
Olivia Vargas?

15:29.273 --> 15:32.862
Ah, it's hard to say.
A picture might jog my memory.

15:33.001 --> 15:34.554
Yes or no.

15:34.692 --> 15:38.523
Come on.
Give me a few details.

15:38.661 --> 15:41.630
We are going to
turn this house inside out.

15:41.768 --> 15:44.357
If we so much as find a hair
that doesn't belong here,

15:44.495 --> 15:45.945
you're going to prison.

15:46.083 --> 15:47.118
Do you need details on that,

15:47.256 --> 15:48.395
or do you remember
what it's like

15:48.533 --> 15:50.742
to be a pedophile behind bars?

15:53.780 --> 15:58.060
These cases are the worst,
just every parent's nightmare.

15:58.198 --> 15:59.786
You have kids?
- Yeah, a daughter.

15:59.924 --> 16:00.994
Losing her would destroy me.

16:01.132 --> 16:03.514
So if you need any help,
I'm here.

16:03.652 --> 16:05.792
He's wearing different shoes.

16:05.930 --> 16:06.724
Are you sure?

16:06.862 --> 16:08.139
I am.

16:08.277 --> 16:09.382
His other ones had
a zipper on the side,

16:09.520 --> 16:10.935
so they don't have to be tied.

16:11.073 --> 16:13.075
Yeah, he saw that we found
a shoe print at the scene.

16:13.213 --> 16:14.352
Probably threw the old ones
in the LA river.

16:14.490 --> 16:15.905
I mean, or his old ones were uncomfortable,

16:16.044 --> 16:17.562
or Nolan's wrong.

16:17.700 --> 16:19.426
Celina, I'm aware
of the history.

16:19.564 --> 16:21.187
But if you can't examine
the facts objectively--

16:21.325 --> 16:22.912
Sorry. I'm--I'm good.

16:23.051 --> 16:24.500
Joel was called
to Olivia's house

16:24.638 --> 16:25.812
several times before
the abduction.

16:25.950 --> 16:27.227
He was also called to

16:27.365 --> 16:28.953
the second and third victims'
homes.

16:29.091 --> 16:32.681
We gotta know if Blanca fits
the same pattern.

16:32.819 --> 16:33.889
Bring Carla in.

16:34.027 --> 16:35.063
Let's see what she remembers.

16:35.201 --> 16:36.616
There's no record of
an arrest

16:36.754 --> 16:38.100
or any sort of calls made to
our house.

16:38.238 --> 16:39.584
And only your mom knows
for sure.

16:39.722 --> 16:42.277
We'll find out.

16:42.415 --> 16:43.899
According to the logs,

16:44.037 --> 16:45.694
Joel was at a premise check
at a warehouse

16:45.832 --> 16:47.075
at the time of the abduction.

16:47.213 --> 16:49.905
GPS on the shop says that
he was there 30 minutes.

16:50.043 --> 16:51.458
How far is the warehouse
from Olivia's house?

16:51.596 --> 16:53.598
Far enough
he would have to drive.

16:53.736 --> 16:54.841
Or maybe he had
a car stashed there.

16:54.979 --> 16:56.084
Look, I can go to the location,

16:56.222 --> 16:57.533
drive the route from
Olivia's and back,

16:57.671 --> 16:58.638
see if it even works.

16:58.776 --> 16:59.742
- Keep me updated.
- Yeah.

16:59.880 --> 17:01.813
So according to the file,

17:01.951 --> 17:05.369
you answered a 415 at
Olivia's house.

17:05.507 --> 17:06.404
That's right.
It was about a month ago.

17:06.542 --> 17:07.854
The neighbor called it in.

17:07.992 --> 17:09.304
Olivia's mom was kicking out

17:09.442 --> 17:12.134
her most recent
deadbeat boyfriend.

17:12.272 --> 17:14.205
Yeah, we are actually
looking into him.

17:14.343 --> 17:16.138
And did you see Olivia?

17:16.276 --> 17:18.554
Yeah, she was
hiding in a corner.

17:18.692 --> 17:19.831
Pretty badly shaken.

17:19.969 --> 17:21.626
She begged me not to
take her mom away.

17:21.764 --> 17:24.250
- And you didn't?
- No signs of abuse.

17:24.388 --> 17:25.630
There wasn't much I could do
but refer them

17:25.768 --> 17:27.736
to Child Protective Services.

17:27.874 --> 17:29.807
You ask me,

17:29.945 --> 17:32.223
we're far too lenient
with parents.

17:32.361 --> 17:34.605
You'll get no argument
from me there.

17:34.743 --> 17:35.882
CPS is overwhelmed.

17:36.020 --> 17:37.401
Even when there's abuse,

17:37.539 --> 17:40.093
the parents get them back
half the time.

17:40.231 --> 17:41.370
It is maddening.

17:41.508 --> 17:43.510
I mean, so many deserving
parents out there

17:43.648 --> 17:45.961
just struggling through
the adoption process.

17:46.099 --> 17:47.997
Exactly.

17:48.136 --> 17:52.416
You also participated in
the search for Celina's sister?

17:52.554 --> 17:53.555
Is that right?

17:53.693 --> 17:55.143
It is.

17:55.281 --> 17:57.352
Why? You don't think
the two cases are related?

17:57.490 --> 17:59.181
Oh, it's just an avenue
we're exploring.

18:03.979 --> 18:05.705
Oh.

18:05.843 --> 18:08.017
I really need to get home.
My birds are--

18:08.156 --> 18:11.020
I know, okay,
but this is important.

18:11.159 --> 18:12.643
We'll get you home
just as soon as we can.

18:12.781 --> 18:14.231
We just need to know

18:14.369 --> 18:16.681
if you remember meeting
an Officer Joel Chambers.

18:16.819 --> 18:18.338
Of course.

18:18.476 --> 18:19.788
He was very helpful.

18:19.926 --> 18:21.893
He--he still checks in on me
years later.

18:22.031 --> 18:24.931
And when did you
first meet him?

18:26.588 --> 18:27.968
It was such a long time ago.

18:28.107 --> 18:31.213
<i>Mami,</i> I need you
to tell me everything,

18:31.351 --> 18:33.353
no matter how upsetting.

18:33.491 --> 18:35.838
There were so many
police officers around.

18:35.976 --> 18:38.117
Okay, so you met him
after Blanca was taken?

18:38.255 --> 18:39.497
- I guess so.
<i>- Mami!</i>

18:39.635 --> 18:42.051
Celina.

18:45.124 --> 18:48.920
Look... I get it.

18:49.058 --> 18:50.853
I--I used to think
you wouldn't leave the house

18:50.991 --> 18:53.062
because you didn't
have answers,

18:53.201 --> 18:54.892
because everyone
you crossed on the street

18:55.030 --> 18:58.516
could be her killer,
but I understand now.

18:58.654 --> 19:00.691
You left once and
the world ended,

19:00.829 --> 19:03.383
so you never left again.

19:03.521 --> 19:06.421
Guilt is what's kept you
locked away.

19:06.559 --> 19:09.734
And the only way out is
to tell the truth.

19:15.464 --> 19:17.190
Okay.

19:17.328 --> 19:22.920
About a month before
Blanca got taken...

19:23.058 --> 19:26.026
Officer Chambers found me
passed out in my car.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.338
I was high.

19:27.476 --> 19:29.375
I had drugs on me.

19:29.513 --> 19:33.137
I begged him not to arrest me.

19:33.275 --> 19:37.417
I told him I had to get home
to you and your sister.

19:37.555 --> 19:40.731
And he drove me home.

19:40.869 --> 19:42.077
Did he talk to
your daughters at all?

19:43.665 --> 19:45.770
He waited in his car.

19:45.908 --> 19:50.258
And I went and
brought them outside.

19:50.396 --> 19:52.743
He watched us play, and--

19:52.881 --> 19:54.883
and then he drove away.

19:55.021 --> 19:56.781
I'll let Harper know.

19:59.612 --> 20:01.614
Wait.

20:03.029 --> 20:05.790
You don't think he took her?

20:05.928 --> 20:07.930
We're not sure yet.

20:11.417 --> 20:13.591
I was so grateful
he didn't arrest me.

20:13.729 --> 20:16.594
I never thought--

20:18.389 --> 20:23.049
Is that the reason
he took Blanca?

20:23.187 --> 20:24.602
Because of me?

20:31.230 --> 20:32.334
Uh, just one more thing.

20:32.472 --> 20:34.509
We talked to Celina's mom, Carla.

20:34.647 --> 20:37.822
She says you picked her up
before the kidnapping?

20:37.960 --> 20:40.653
You could have arrested her
and you didn't.

20:40.791 --> 20:41.861
- Really?
- Yeah,

20:41.999 --> 20:43.207
You said you didn't
meet them until

20:43.345 --> 20:45.658
after Celina's sister
went missing.

20:45.796 --> 20:47.038
Oh.

20:49.282 --> 20:52.043
Uh, I guess I forgot.
- Ah.

20:52.181 --> 20:54.287
You meet so many people
in our line of work.

20:54.425 --> 20:55.530
You remember everyone
that you picked up

20:55.668 --> 20:57.394
when you were on patrol?
- Oh, God, not a chance.

20:57.532 --> 21:01.121
I have two kids, so I can
barely remember breakfast.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.985
Uh, give me a minute, will you?
- Of course.

21:03.123 --> 21:05.056
Hey, am I free to go?

21:06.748 --> 21:08.784
It'll just be a second.

21:17.206 --> 21:19.312
<i>Detective Lopez.
Found something.</i>

21:21.866 --> 21:22.971
What is it?

21:28.183 --> 21:30.668
According to Tim,
Joel had plenty of time

21:30.806 --> 21:33.084
to drive from the premise shack
to Olivia's house.

21:33.222 --> 21:34.500
Just because he could have
doesn't mean he did.

21:34.638 --> 21:36.743
I saw his face when
I caught him in the lie.

21:36.881 --> 21:38.055
He was terrified.

21:38.193 --> 21:38.987
Well, do you think
you could get more

21:39.125 --> 21:40.229
if you keep questioning him?

21:40.368 --> 21:42.508
No.
He asked if he was free to go.

21:42.646 --> 21:44.233
He knows he's a suspect.

21:44.372 --> 21:45.511
He's forcing you
to show your hand.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.828
Angela, you're on speakerphone
with Wesley and Nyla.

21:52.966 --> 21:54.658
<i>We found something at
Drew's house.</i>

21:54.796 --> 21:56.315
It's Olivia's teddy bear.

21:56.453 --> 21:58.731
Drew's our guy. He took her.

22:09.362 --> 22:11.364
<i>Celina.</i>

22:13.884 --> 22:14.885
<i>Celina.</i>

22:15.023 --> 22:16.852
- Celina.
- Yes.

22:16.990 --> 22:18.095
Lopez wants him
in interview three.

22:18.233 --> 22:20.856
Yes, right.

22:20.994 --> 22:22.962
So this means
Joel's innocent, right?

22:23.100 --> 22:25.516
We don't know
anything for sure.

22:27.932 --> 22:29.796
Hey, you sure it's
Olivia's teddy bear?

22:29.934 --> 22:31.384
Lab's working on
a DNA match now,

22:31.522 --> 22:33.213
and Olivia's mom IDed it
as hers.

22:33.352 --> 22:34.422
So where does that leave us
in the Joel theory?

22:34.560 --> 22:35.802
I still like Joel.

22:35.940 --> 22:37.977
He has been overly involved
in both cases,

22:38.115 --> 22:39.737
and he lied to us
about his prior contact

22:39.875 --> 22:41.221
with Celina's mother.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.740
Yeah, but any good
defense attorney will argue

22:42.878 --> 22:44.397
that his only crime is
caring too much.

22:44.535 --> 22:46.123
Both abductions happened on
his daughter's birthday.

22:46.261 --> 22:47.469
Coincidence?

22:47.607 --> 22:48.574
Well, that's why
he got so involved.

22:48.712 --> 22:50.576
He saw his daughter in
these two girls.

22:50.714 --> 22:53.613
It's shaky, but you only need
one jury member to buy that.

22:53.751 --> 22:55.339
The teddy bear,
on the other hand,

22:55.477 --> 22:57.272
Drew's lawyer will have a hell
of a time explaining that away.

22:57.410 --> 22:58.618
You found it in his backyard.

22:58.756 --> 23:00.137
Anyone could've gained access.

23:00.275 --> 23:02.311
Look, if you are Joel,

23:02.450 --> 23:05.004
you know that they found
a boot print.

23:05.142 --> 23:06.730
The first thing you do is
throw those boots away.

23:06.868 --> 23:07.972
The second thing you do is

23:08.110 --> 23:09.974
throw suspicion
on someone else.

23:10.112 --> 23:12.011
He knew Drew was
a suspect back in the day,

23:12.149 --> 23:13.806
the perfect patsy.
I can sell that.

23:13.944 --> 23:16.809
Okay, we're a long way
from a jury.

23:16.947 --> 23:17.844
There's a missing girl
out there.

23:17.982 --> 23:19.156
She's the priority.

23:19.294 --> 23:21.089
Can you press Joel,
get a confession?

23:21.227 --> 23:22.573
No, he knows I'm onto him.

23:22.711 --> 23:24.782
We could arrest.
- But that starts a clock.

23:24.920 --> 23:26.508
We have 72 hours
to bring charges.

23:26.646 --> 23:28.165
And we're not ready for that.

23:28.303 --> 23:29.994
Then we let him go.

23:30.132 --> 23:31.824
Keep working Drew.

23:31.962 --> 23:34.274
On it.

23:36.000 --> 23:39.176
So I wanted you to be
the first to know,

23:39.314 --> 23:40.833
we got him.

23:40.971 --> 23:42.386
- Really?
- I don't know if you remember

23:42.524 --> 23:45.009
the guy from Blanca's case,
Drew Heslov?

23:45.147 --> 23:47.495
Yeah, he had
a prior conviction.

23:47.633 --> 23:50.014
Yep, that's the guy.

23:50.152 --> 23:52.845
They found Olivia's teddy bear
in his yard.

23:52.983 --> 23:54.674
Did you bring him in?

23:54.812 --> 23:56.676
Yeah, he's in processing
right now.

23:56.814 --> 23:58.160
Huh.

23:58.298 --> 23:59.610
- So thank you...
- Oh.

23:59.748 --> 24:01.405
- For all of your help.
- Of course, of course.

24:01.543 --> 24:02.682
Listen, it's time
for me to clock out,

24:02.820 --> 24:05.305
but if you need anything else,
you got my cell.

24:05.444 --> 24:06.893
- Yeah.
- Okay.

24:12.658 --> 24:14.073
We need a surveillance team.

24:14.211 --> 24:16.178
That's six cops now out there
looking for Olivia.

24:16.316 --> 24:18.526
I told him that we found
Olivia's teddy bear,

24:18.664 --> 24:20.838
but he did not ask
about Olivia.

24:20.976 --> 24:22.702
He doesn't need to.
He knows exactly where she is.

24:22.840 --> 24:24.532
I am telling you, it is Joel.

24:24.670 --> 24:26.637
We can't let him
out of our sight.

24:26.775 --> 24:28.639
Let's alert metro.

24:36.198 --> 24:37.476
Walking to
his personal vehicle,

24:37.614 --> 24:39.754
silver pickup truck.

24:39.892 --> 24:43.827
California plates, two, George,
Adam, Tom, one, two, three.

24:52.387 --> 24:54.389
<i>North Compass Point has him,
westbound Whilshire.</i>

24:54.527 --> 24:56.495
<i>Number two lane,
approaching a stale green.</i>

24:56.633 --> 24:58.255
<i>Two for cover.</i>

24:58.393 --> 24:59.774
Wheatley, Bradford.
<i>- Go for Wheatley.</i>

24:59.912 --> 25:01.845
Confirm we have
all six units on this,

25:01.983 --> 25:03.536
four compass points,
two rovers.

25:03.674 --> 25:05.676
<i>- Affirm, boss.</i>
- Good.

25:05.814 --> 25:07.506
Everyone keep radios low,
cover coats on,

25:07.644 --> 25:09.024
and be ready for crazy Ivans.

25:09.162 --> 25:10.923
He may do a counter.
We cannot let him get away.

25:13.132 --> 25:14.616
Can you ID this item?

25:14.754 --> 25:17.205
Aw, it's a teddy bear.

25:17.343 --> 25:19.932
Was it hers, that Olivia kid
you were asking about?

25:20.070 --> 25:22.555
- Yes.
- Oh, she must be young.

25:22.693 --> 25:23.798
Eight years old?

25:25.558 --> 25:27.318
Younger?

25:27.456 --> 25:29.286
Have you ever seen this item
before?

25:29.424 --> 25:30.977
No.

25:31.115 --> 25:33.946
Then how do you explain
its presence in your backyard?

25:35.292 --> 25:36.949
What?

25:37.087 --> 25:39.330
How did Olivia's favorite toy
come into your possession?

25:39.468 --> 25:40.918
It didn't.

25:41.056 --> 25:42.333
I don't know.

25:42.471 --> 25:44.439
You're lying.
- I'm not lying.

25:44.577 --> 25:45.785
We found it in your backyard.

25:45.923 --> 25:47.131
No!

25:49.064 --> 25:52.067
Look, I know what I am.

25:52.205 --> 25:53.517
I know what I've done.

25:53.655 --> 25:57.590
But I swear, I've never
laid eyes on that kid.

26:00.766 --> 26:02.250
<i>Bradford, this is Wheatley.</i>

26:02.388 --> 26:03.907
<i>Target has landed
in the parking</i>

26:04.045 --> 26:05.943
<i>of a home improvement store.</i>

26:06.081 --> 26:07.945
<i>I'm pulling into the other
entrance to the parking lot.</i>

26:12.571 --> 26:14.676
All right, Bradford copies.
All units compass up.

26:14.814 --> 26:16.782
Standby for roll call in three.

26:16.920 --> 26:19.370
<i>Target is making contact
with another subject.</i>

26:19.508 --> 26:21.787
<i>Male, white, blue jacket,
black pants.</i>

26:21.925 --> 26:25.135
<i>Target is handing the subject
his gym bag.</i>

26:25.273 --> 26:27.344
<i>Subject number two is
walking away with the gym bag.</i>

26:27.482 --> 26:29.346
All units, stay with primary.

26:29.484 --> 26:30.865
<i>Confirm, you don't want
anyone going with</i>

26:31.003 --> 26:33.177
<i>that secondary?</i>

26:33.315 --> 26:35.110
No, no. He knows
he's under surveillance.

26:35.248 --> 26:36.560
He's trying to split the team.

26:36.698 --> 26:38.355
<i>Secondary is approaching
a black Charger.</i>

26:40.184 --> 26:43.153
<i>He'll be away in five, four,
three, two--</i>

26:43.291 --> 26:45.224
Miller, Jones, Clark,
go with secondary.

26:45.362 --> 26:46.535
Wheatley, Smith, and I will
stay with primary.

26:46.674 --> 26:48.365
And get me six
additional units ASAP.

26:48.503 --> 26:52.818
<i>Copy that. Secondary units,
work off encrypted channel 18.</i>

26:57.063 --> 26:58.513
Bradford on point.

27:03.242 --> 27:05.382
Primary's approaching
a motorcyclist.

27:05.520 --> 27:07.418
They're talking.

27:08.696 --> 27:10.836
Primary is taking
the motorcycle.

27:10.974 --> 27:14.494
<i>I have eyes on primary.</i>

27:27.507 --> 27:29.026
<i>Wheatley, Bradford,</i>

27:29.164 --> 27:30.994
<i>what's the ETA on
those additional units?</i>

27:31.132 --> 27:33.375
<i>ETA nine minutes.</i>

27:33.513 --> 27:34.894
Copy that.
We have a fresh green.

27:35.032 --> 27:38.277
Looks like
he's picking up speed.

27:38.415 --> 27:40.072
<i>He knows we're here.
I just hit the lights.</i>

27:50.772 --> 27:52.256
Control, can I get
an airship assist?

27:52.394 --> 27:53.810
Metro, Pico and Washington.

27:53.948 --> 27:55.846
<i>Copy, Air 5 is closest.
She's en route.</i>

27:55.984 --> 27:56.882
<i>ETA 3 minutes.</i>

27:57.020 --> 27:58.055
Speeds approaching 100.

27:58.193 --> 28:00.126
<i>Sarge, I can stay with him.</i>

28:00.264 --> 28:03.612
<i>He's now 120,
getting on the 405 North.</i>

28:03.751 --> 28:05.442
<i>- On the shoulder.</i>
- Negative, shut it down.

28:05.580 --> 28:07.547
<i>- Sarge, he took a kid!
- Speed's 130.</i>

28:07.686 --> 28:09.204
Negative, shut it down.

28:09.342 --> 28:11.103
It's not worth plowing into
some innocent family.

28:11.241 --> 28:12.967
<i>Copy that. Shutting down.</i>

28:14.658 --> 28:16.073
<i>Primary is gone.</i>

28:16.211 --> 28:17.799
Damn it.

28:21.113 --> 28:22.286
- You let him get away?
- Celina.

28:22.424 --> 28:23.771
- Excuse me?
- Joel has her.

28:23.909 --> 28:25.773
I mean, he's probably on
his way to kill her right now.

28:25.911 --> 28:27.567
We're all aware of
the situation, Officer Juarez.

28:27.706 --> 28:28.534
Okay, then why weren't there
more units?

28:28.672 --> 28:29.742
I mean, how could this happen?

28:29.880 --> 28:30.950
My apologies, sergeants.

28:31.088 --> 28:33.573
Officer Juarez, Joel is a cop.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.679
He knew our techniques,
and he used them against us.

28:35.817 --> 28:37.439
There's nothing metro
could have done.

28:37.577 --> 28:39.648
He is gone.

28:39.787 --> 28:41.823
The only question now is where?

28:43.722 --> 28:46.069
- Where could he be?
- Better.

28:46.207 --> 28:48.830
Listen up.

28:48.968 --> 28:51.246
Our suspect is a cop.

28:51.384 --> 28:53.973
He's been meticulous and smart
every step of the way.

28:54.111 --> 28:55.595
We need to be smarter.

28:55.734 --> 28:57.252
No one pulls
something like this off

28:57.390 --> 29:00.014
without leaving a trail.
Find it.

29:00.152 --> 29:01.118
Let's go.

29:11.991 --> 29:13.303
Uh, sorry,
I just needed a minute.

29:13.441 --> 29:14.960
Oh, of course.

29:17.031 --> 29:19.792
You know,
I never knew my father.

29:19.930 --> 29:22.795
When I was little,
I used to wish Joel--

29:24.486 --> 29:26.143
What do I tell Olivia's mom?

29:26.281 --> 29:27.317
I mean, she's so scared.

29:27.455 --> 29:28.801
She's counting on us
to find her.

29:28.939 --> 29:31.631
- And we will.
- But what if we're too late?

29:31.770 --> 29:33.357
What if we have to tell her
that Olivia's gone,

29:33.495 --> 29:35.774
and it's our fault that we--
- Okay.

29:35.912 --> 29:37.396
Maybe you need to take
a little break.

29:37.534 --> 29:40.330
I can't. I can't do anything
else until we find her.

29:40.468 --> 29:41.814
<i>Sarge?</i>

29:41.952 --> 29:43.505
Looks like
they've got something.

29:45.404 --> 29:47.026
We've been combing through
Joel's unit history,

29:47.164 --> 29:49.201
every name, address,
license plate he logged

29:49.339 --> 29:50.719
while on duty over
the last three months.

29:50.858 --> 29:52.204
Yeah, six weeks ago,
he cleared a pair of squatters

29:52.342 --> 29:53.550
out of a foreclosed home.

29:53.688 --> 29:55.241
It's a low income area,
mostly industrial.

29:55.379 --> 29:56.553
But you could easily get
in and out

29:56.691 --> 29:58.727
without anyone noticing.
- That's a slim lead.

29:58.866 --> 30:01.730
Yeah, except it's less than a
mile away from Olivia's house,

30:01.869 --> 30:04.078
and he cleared it three days
after he first met the family.

30:04.216 --> 30:05.493
He was getting
everything in place.

30:05.631 --> 30:07.219
Okay, well, then that's it.
Olivia's there.

30:52.816 --> 30:54.749
All inbound units,
metro unit on scene.

30:54.887 --> 30:57.062
Vehicle registered to our
suspect is parked out front.

30:57.200 --> 30:58.546
No sign of our 207 victim.

30:58.684 --> 31:00.099
<i>Second team is 9-7.</i>

31:00.237 --> 31:01.652
<i>We're in the alley behind
target on Sheldon.</i>

31:01.790 --> 31:02.757
All right,
we need eyes inside.

31:02.895 --> 31:04.069
Let's get a ball cam ready.

31:04.207 --> 31:05.277
What's the play?

31:05.415 --> 31:06.312
We need to get
a better look inside,

31:06.450 --> 31:08.107
see how much firepower's
in there.

31:10.627 --> 31:11.593
Ball cam's live.

31:27.161 --> 31:29.439
Okay, I can see him.
He can see us.

31:29.577 --> 31:31.786
- What about Olivia?
- No sign of her.

31:31.924 --> 31:34.409
So we breach, right?
I mean, we have to find her.

31:34.547 --> 31:36.446
If she's alive, that's
a sure way to change that.

31:36.584 --> 31:37.757
We need to get him talking.

31:37.896 --> 31:38.931
Her best chance is
if we can end this

31:39.069 --> 31:40.346
without firing a shot.

31:40.484 --> 31:42.003
You give me some cover,
I'll get a phone to Joel.

31:42.141 --> 31:43.349
Phone drop.

31:43.487 --> 31:45.006
Get ready to approach.

31:51.426 --> 31:53.325
Joel, we're just gonna
throw a phone

31:53.463 --> 31:55.568
on the other side
of the door, all right?

31:55.706 --> 31:58.123
All we want to do is talk,

31:58.261 --> 32:01.574
settle this before anyone
gets hurt.

32:10.825 --> 32:12.447
I confirm suspect has
a 9 millimeter

32:12.585 --> 32:14.794
in his right hand.
No other weapons are visible.

32:17.349 --> 32:18.729
Wait, what was that?
Turn it around.

32:20.490 --> 32:22.181
She's out cold.
Probably drugged.

32:25.012 --> 32:26.634
What was that?

32:26.772 --> 32:28.015
He shot the camera.

32:28.153 --> 32:29.982
This is Sergeant Bradford.

32:30.120 --> 32:30.949
Did you think
I wouldn't notice

32:31.087 --> 32:32.640
your little eye rolling around?

32:32.778 --> 32:34.366
You know I had to
take a look,

32:34.504 --> 32:35.677
<i>assess the situation.</i>

32:35.815 --> 32:37.472
Who's that?

32:37.610 --> 32:38.818
Is that Olivia?

32:38.957 --> 32:40.855
No more cameras
and get your guys back.

32:40.993 --> 32:42.236
I can do that for you

32:42.374 --> 32:43.478
but I need you to do something
for me.

32:43.616 --> 32:44.721
I need to make sure
Olivia's okay.

32:44.859 --> 32:46.550
She's fine.
I'm protecting her.

32:46.688 --> 32:47.862
Okay, that's great.

32:48.000 --> 32:48.725
But it would help
if we could see her.

32:48.863 --> 32:50.416
No, not a chance.

32:50.554 --> 32:52.349
I show my face,
you're gonna blow it off.

32:53.661 --> 32:55.042
He thinks
he's protecting her.

32:55.180 --> 32:56.595
That's gotta be
a good thing, right?

32:56.733 --> 32:59.322
He thought he was
protecting Blanca too.

32:59.460 --> 33:01.255
He's probably justifying
the murders,

33:01.393 --> 33:03.498
death being better than
the life they were living.

33:03.636 --> 33:04.672
Yeah, but if he's not
willing to talk,

33:04.810 --> 33:06.087
then we need to go in.

33:11.851 --> 33:13.508
I am done talking.

33:13.646 --> 33:14.993
It's me. It's Celina.

33:17.202 --> 33:18.099
Joel?

33:19.721 --> 33:20.757
Yeah.

33:20.895 --> 33:22.345
I'm outside.

33:24.381 --> 33:26.521
Listen, I--I know that
you don't understand.

33:26.659 --> 33:28.730
Her parents didn't deserve her.
- I know.

33:28.868 --> 33:30.732
You did it to keep her safe,
just like the others,

33:30.870 --> 33:33.459
just like--like Blanca.

33:33.597 --> 33:37.912
<i>I think they remind you
of your daughter.</i>

33:38.050 --> 33:40.708
I just want to be
a father again.

33:40.846 --> 33:42.572
<i>Why don't they understand?</i>

33:42.710 --> 33:45.609
<i>They just keep crying and
begging to go back home.</i>

33:46.748 --> 33:48.440
I gave them a better life
than they ever had,

33:48.578 --> 33:52.306
and they want to go back to
some loser drug addict?

33:52.444 --> 33:53.928
Tell him
what he wants to hear.

33:58.795 --> 34:00.521
You're right.

34:00.659 --> 34:01.625
They needed you.

34:01.763 --> 34:03.800
They--they needed a father,

34:03.938 --> 34:07.148
<i>someone to--
to guide them, to--</i>

34:07.286 --> 34:09.909
to keep them safe.

34:10.048 --> 34:11.911
But Olivia's not safe
right now, is she?

34:12.050 --> 34:13.120
<i>Not with all these
guns outside.</i>

34:13.258 --> 34:15.950
We need to get her
out of that house.

34:19.643 --> 34:21.335
We're not leaving.

34:21.473 --> 34:22.922
I don't trust anyone out there.

34:23.061 --> 34:24.407
Okay, well, then
what about me?

34:24.545 --> 34:26.029
How about I--
I come get Olivia?

34:27.824 --> 34:29.895
<i>Joel, it's over.</i>

34:30.033 --> 34:31.931
<i>You need to know that.</i>

34:32.070 --> 34:33.623
<i>End it by doing what
you wanted to do.</i>

34:33.761 --> 34:38.283
End it by protecting her.

34:41.286 --> 34:42.597
Do you think
he's gonna let her go?

34:42.735 --> 34:44.358
- I don't know.
- All right, we're in position.

34:44.496 --> 34:47.119
As soon as she's clear,
we breach.

34:57.854 --> 34:59.959
Celina!
- Celina, hey!

35:00.098 --> 35:01.375
We're good.

35:01.513 --> 35:02.686
Look alive.
Move, move.

35:02.824 --> 35:06.311
It's all clear.

35:06.449 --> 35:08.554
Breach.

35:08.692 --> 35:10.280
Go, go, go.

35:12.144 --> 35:13.111
Clear.

35:14.215 --> 35:15.665
Clear.

35:15.803 --> 35:17.701
Clear in here.

35:17.839 --> 35:20.048
- Clear.
- Clear.

35:20.808 --> 35:22.223
Good.

35:22.361 --> 35:24.881
There. Are you okay?
Are you hurt?

35:26.158 --> 35:27.504
Clear.

35:27.642 --> 35:28.850
Clear!

35:31.681 --> 35:33.200
Clear.

35:39.447 --> 35:40.621
Drop the gun.

35:42.864 --> 35:45.246
Drop the gun!

35:46.868 --> 35:47.731
Drop it!

35:53.047 --> 35:55.083
<i>Suspect down. Send an RA.</i>

36:02.574 --> 36:04.438
Hey, Harper.

36:04.576 --> 36:06.060
Um...

36:06.198 --> 36:08.545
Tim is still in with IA.

36:08.683 --> 36:10.547
Look, the officer involved
shooting interview

36:10.685 --> 36:12.894
is very thorough.

36:13.032 --> 36:14.033
Tim's fine.
- Right.

36:14.172 --> 36:15.242
Hey, Chen.

36:15.380 --> 36:16.381
I've got news for you.

36:16.519 --> 36:17.727
It's not a great time, Smitty.

36:17.865 --> 36:20.592
It's about
the detective exam.

36:20.730 --> 36:23.250
The detective blocking you
is Prim.

36:23.388 --> 36:25.390
He heard about your little
scheme to help Bradford

36:25.528 --> 36:26.874
and was less than impressed.

36:27.012 --> 36:29.532
Oh, the five player trade.

36:29.670 --> 36:31.154
Turns out treating people
like puppets

36:31.292 --> 36:33.052
wasn't the best way to
make friends.

36:33.191 --> 36:36.711
Thank you, Smitty.

36:36.849 --> 36:38.023
I did warn you.

36:38.161 --> 36:40.163
I know.

36:43.131 --> 36:44.547
Hey.

36:44.685 --> 36:46.100
Let him talk to Grey first.

36:52.175 --> 36:54.073
Hey, come in.

36:55.972 --> 36:57.939
All done with IA?

36:58.077 --> 36:59.941
Uh, yeah.

37:00.079 --> 37:03.945
I'm sure you'll be cleared to
return to work in no time.

37:04.083 --> 37:05.982
I hope so.

37:09.123 --> 37:11.159
Hey.

37:11.298 --> 37:13.645
You know you had to
take the shot.

37:13.783 --> 37:14.818
I know.

37:14.956 --> 37:15.957
Just 'cause he wanted to die

37:16.095 --> 37:18.512
doesn't mean
he wasn't dangerous.

37:18.650 --> 37:20.410
I know.

37:24.103 --> 37:25.243
Is there anything I can do?

37:29.385 --> 37:31.835
Can I get back to you
on that?

37:31.973 --> 37:33.147
Take your time.

37:37.082 --> 37:39.705
You know, it's her first time
visiting Blanca's grave.

37:39.843 --> 37:42.294
I honestly never thought
she'd make it here.

37:42.432 --> 37:44.262
How was she on
the drive over?

37:44.400 --> 37:47.023
Shaky. She didn't say a word.

37:48.714 --> 37:51.096
She's still not here--

37:51.234 --> 37:52.649
Blanca.

37:52.787 --> 37:54.651
And I think I know why.

37:54.789 --> 37:55.894
She moved on.

37:56.032 --> 37:58.517
She knows I don't need her anymore.

38:04.178 --> 38:06.284
You want to go join your mom?

38:17.364 --> 38:18.986
I brought him into our lives.

38:19.124 --> 38:20.884
No, he preyed on
your illness.

38:21.022 --> 38:22.679
You can't blame yourself.

38:22.817 --> 38:26.338
But I do.

38:26.476 --> 38:29.065
And I blame myself for
all the days and weeks

38:29.203 --> 38:32.379
leading up to it.

38:32.517 --> 38:35.485
I was barely there.

38:35.623 --> 38:39.247
Short-tempered,
sleeping all the time.

38:44.460 --> 38:47.670
They were the last days of
her life,

38:47.808 --> 38:49.430
and I wasted them.

38:49.568 --> 38:52.191
You were addicted.
It's not your fault.

38:52.330 --> 38:56.334
Mama, I know you can't forgive
yourself, but...

38:56.472 --> 39:00.993
I want you to know that
I forgive you.

39:11.418 --> 39:14.248
Oh, baby.

39:14.386 --> 39:16.215
I forgive you.

39:16.354 --> 39:18.425
<i>♪ But it's over ♪</i>

39:18.563 --> 39:20.185
I'm sorry.

39:20.323 --> 39:21.911
Jack is asleep.

39:22.049 --> 39:24.223
And according to my watch,
I paced up and down our hallway

39:24.362 --> 39:26.778
for a total of 12 miles.

39:29.712 --> 39:32.059
I thought that was impressive.

39:32.197 --> 39:33.992
What's this?

39:34.130 --> 39:36.788
A mommy blogger posted
top 10 ways to prevent

39:36.926 --> 39:40.688
your kid from getting taken.

39:40.826 --> 39:43.760
You know the vast majority of
missing kids are taken by a--

39:43.898 --> 39:45.486
A non-custodial parent.

39:45.624 --> 39:46.936
I know.

39:49.421 --> 39:50.629
This was a hard case.

39:50.767 --> 39:53.114
<i>♪ Set my soul on fire ♪</i>

39:53.252 --> 39:55.323
<i>♪ Take me to the light ♪</i>

39:55.462 --> 39:58.188
Celina's mom...

39:58.326 --> 40:00.328
I don't know how
you survive that.

40:00.467 --> 40:03.677
<i>♪ Set my soul on fire ♪</i>

40:03.815 --> 40:05.989
<i>♪ Take us to the light ♪</i>

40:06.127 --> 40:07.991
If you're worried about
Jack's safety,

40:08.129 --> 40:09.786
we could always have
Charlie come back.

40:09.924 --> 40:11.478
Charlie?

40:11.616 --> 40:15.171
Oh, the smoking hot
ex-SAS bodyguard?

40:15.309 --> 40:17.104
I'm not saying I want that.

40:17.242 --> 40:18.623
Just thinking about
your peace of mind.

40:18.761 --> 40:22.178
Hmm, how selfless.

40:22.316 --> 40:23.800
You are a bad ass.

40:23.938 --> 40:26.941
And I'm no slouch.

40:27.079 --> 40:31.187
Jack and the new baby
are gonna be safe.

40:31.325 --> 40:32.706
Okay?

40:32.844 --> 40:34.742

40:34.880 --> 40:36.261
Yeah.

40:39.091 --> 40:40.679

"AirTag your kids"?

40:49.343 --> 40:50.793
No.

40:53.140 --> 40:54.486
Mm--no.

40:55.832 --> 40:57.662
How are you doing
with everything?

40:57.800 --> 41:00.043
I'll be okay.

41:00.181 --> 41:01.562
You know,
maybe you should try--

41:01.700 --> 41:02.977
Exercise before going to bed?

41:03.115 --> 41:04.047
Yeah, I know.

41:04.185 --> 41:05.117
It's not the first time I--

41:05.255 --> 41:06.740
No, I--I know it isn't.

41:06.878 --> 41:09.052
I know that. I just--

41:09.190 --> 41:11.469
I--I want to be helpful.

41:11.607 --> 41:12.849
I know.

41:12.987 --> 41:14.575
Thank you.

41:15.576 --> 41:17.233
You need help studying?

41:17.371 --> 41:18.579
There's no way
I would have scored

41:18.717 --> 41:20.754
as well on the sergeant's
exam without you.

41:20.892 --> 41:23.515
That's true.

41:23.653 --> 41:24.689
You owe me.

41:24.827 --> 41:27.415
- I don't owe you.
- You owe me.

<i>♪ Set my soul on fire ♪</i>

41:28.934 --> 41:30.660
Okay.

41:30.798 --> 41:33.421
We saved a kid,
solved a cold case,

41:33.560 --> 41:36.217
and helped our friend
find closure.

41:36.355 --> 41:38.047
And there's still technically
three hours left

41:38.185 --> 41:40.221
on my day off.
- Oh, there are?

41:40.359 --> 41:42.051
I can finally rest.

41:42.189 --> 41:44.881
Oh, I'm sorry I can't let you
get any rest tonight.

41:45.019 --> 41:46.262
I have plans for you.

41:46.400 --> 41:48.402
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, yeah.

41:48.540 --> 41:54.442
So settle in for
a nice, long night of...

41:54.581 --> 41:56.859
catching up on "The Bachelor."

41:56.997 --> 41:59.724
Oh, there's gonna be
limo arrivals

41:59.862 --> 42:03.175
and rose ceremonies.

42:03.313 --> 42:04.970
Sadly, lots of crying.

42:05.108 --> 42:10.010
For every dream realized,
a hope will be dashed.

42:10.148 --> 42:12.530
Honey?

42:12.668 --> 42:13.807
Baby?

42:15.981 --> 42:19.191
If you don't want me to watch
ahead without you, just say so.

42:19.329 --> 42:20.986
I love you too.

42:56.850 --> 42:57.747
Damn it.
