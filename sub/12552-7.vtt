00:05.772 --> 00:07.240
CLYDE: <i>13 Bannerman Road is</i>
<i>where Sarah Jane Smith lives</i>

00:07.307 --> 00:10.477
<i>and it's home to things</i>
<i>way beyond your imagination.</i>

00:10.543 --> 00:14.381
<i>There's an extraterrestrial,</i>
<i>super computer in the wall,</i>

00:14.447 --> 00:17.917
<i>a genetically engineered</i>
<i>boy genius in the attic,</i>

00:17.984 --> 00:21.154
<i>a school girl investigator</i>
<i>across the road,</i>

00:21.221 --> 00:24.858
<i>and a whole universe</i>
<i>of adventure</i>
<i>right here on the doorstep.</i>

00:29.629 --> 00:30.897
-Ready?
-Always.

00:37.237 --> 00:38.805
PROFESSOR RIVERS:
<i>No-one really knows</i>

00:38.872 --> 00:42.142
<i>just when Ashen Hill Manor</i>
<i>was first built.</i>

00:42.208 --> 00:46.012
<i>But, through history,</i>
<i>there has always been</i>
<i>a house here.</i>

00:46.079 --> 00:49.916
<i>And, so they say, just as long</i>
<i>as there's been stone and oak,</i>

00:49.983 --> 00:52.118
<i>there has always been evil.</i>

00:57.590 --> 00:59.926
<i>They say it was the reputation</i>
<i>of the house</i>

00:59.993 --> 01:02.862
<i>that attracted the magician</i>
<i>Erasmus Darkening.</i>

01:09.936 --> 01:13.440
<i>He entered the service of the</i>
<i>young lord of the manor,</i>
<i>the widower,</i>

01:13.506 --> 01:15.275
<i>Lord Marchwood.</i>

01:15.341 --> 01:18.745
<i>Darkening promised that</i>
<i>in return for his protection,</i>

01:18.812 --> 01:22.048
<i>he would replenish</i>
<i>the family's fortunes</i>
<i>with the secret</i>

01:22.115 --> 01:25.351
<i>of making gold</i>
<i>from base metal.</i>

01:25.418 --> 01:30.957
<i>But after two years working</i>
<i>in a secret chamber</i>
<i>far beneath the house,</i>

01:31.024 --> 01:35.428
<i>Darkening's alchemy</i>
<i>had failed to bear</i>
<i>one ounce of gold.</i>

01:39.866 --> 01:43.203
<i>And the people</i>
<i>on Marchwood's land</i>
<i>were uneasy.</i>

01:43.269 --> 01:46.439
<i>There were stories</i>
<i>of how Darkening came</i>
<i>among them at night,</i>

01:46.506 --> 01:49.342
<i>of how he took away people</i>
<i>that never returned</i>

01:49.409 --> 01:51.945
<i>and that he was not human.</i>

01:57.750 --> 01:59.052
(SCREAMING)

02:00.954 --> 02:03.089
LORD MARCHWOOD:
Elizabeth?

02:03.156 --> 02:04.457
Joseph?

02:11.097 --> 02:13.399
Elizabeth! Joseph!

02:14.467 --> 02:16.669
My children, where are you?

02:22.141 --> 02:26.546
RIVERS: <i>No matter how long,</i>
<i>no matter how hard their</i>
<i>father searched for them,</i>

02:26.613 --> 02:29.382
<i>they were never ever</i>
<i>seen again.</i>

02:38.825 --> 02:40.460
My children!

02:41.227 --> 02:42.829
My children!

02:45.798 --> 02:48.968
And they say
he searches still.

02:49.035 --> 02:52.005
SARAH: It's a good story,
Professor, but I don't
believe in ghosts.

02:52.071 --> 02:55.675
Of course you don't.
And neither do I.
But Ashen Hill Manor

02:55.742 --> 02:59.112
is reputedly one of
the most haunted
locations in the UK.

03:08.321 --> 03:11.791
CLYDE: So let me get
this right, if you don't
believe in ghosts, Sarah Jane,

03:11.858 --> 03:14.227
and you don't
believe in ghosts,
Professor, then...

03:14.294 --> 03:15.662
SARAH: What are we doing here?

03:15.728 --> 03:16.930
RIVERS: To see if we're right.

03:17.130 --> 03:20.600
To find out scientifically
one way or the other.

03:20.667 --> 03:24.203
In that case, I'm delighted
you invited me along
to cover the story.

03:24.270 --> 03:27.340
RIVERS: We're set up
through here.

03:27.407 --> 03:29.342
Are you sure
about this? I mean...

03:29.409 --> 03:31.311
there's no such things
as ghosts, is there?

03:31.377 --> 03:33.079
Clyde, I don't
believe you.

03:33.146 --> 03:36.382
After all
the things we've seen,
you're scared of ghosts!

03:36.449 --> 03:40.486
Who said anything
about scared?
Did I mention scared?

03:40.553 --> 03:41.821
I don't think so.

03:41.888 --> 03:43.957
Don't worry. I'm sure.

03:44.023 --> 03:46.492
Whatever people
may think they've seen
at Ashen Hill Manor,

03:46.559 --> 03:49.862
it has more to do
with imagination
than the supernatural.

04:17.589 --> 04:21.194
Introductions,
Sarah Jane Smith,
journalist.

04:21.260 --> 04:23.463
My assistant from the
Pharos Institute,

04:23.529 --> 04:24.564
Toby Silverman.

04:24.631 --> 04:25.965
Hello, Toby.

04:26.032 --> 04:28.034
Um. This is Rani
and Clyde.

04:28.101 --> 04:29.669
Sort of Sarah Jane's
apprentice.

04:29.736 --> 04:32.772
And I'm carrying
the sandwiches.

04:32.839 --> 04:35.475
So are you the
technical genius?

04:35.541 --> 04:37.677
Well, I don't know
about that.

04:37.744 --> 04:40.880
I'm just interested in the
quantifiable effects of
meta-normal energies

04:40.947 --> 04:43.182
on the established phenomena.

04:43.249 --> 04:44.684
We should've
brought Luke.

04:44.751 --> 04:48.421
Only he said that people
who believed in ghosts

04:48.488 --> 04:51.858
-were still living
in the Dark Ages.
-(BOTH LAUGHING)

04:51.924 --> 04:53.793
Or something
like that.

04:53.860 --> 04:55.461
Luke is my son.

04:55.528 --> 04:59.265
Toby is the son of Professor
Sir Rupert Silverman.

04:59.332 --> 05:01.200
The physicist?

05:01.267 --> 05:04.003
What does your father
think of his son dabbling
in the paranormal?

05:04.070 --> 05:06.873
I ought to get on with
putting my monitoring
equipment together.

05:06.939 --> 05:09.409
Yes, of course.

05:09.475 --> 05:13.746
This house has a long
history of psychic activity.

05:13.813 --> 05:16.449
Then there are the
disappearances.

05:16.516 --> 05:20.520
Disappearances?
Nobody said anything about
any disappearances.

05:20.586 --> 05:22.422
No, they didn't.

05:22.488 --> 05:24.624
There's something else,
isn't there?

05:24.691 --> 05:26.592
The Scrivens family,

05:26.659 --> 05:30.530
who legally still own
the house, a mother,
a father and two children,

05:30.596 --> 05:33.166
vanished one night
20 years ago.

05:33.232 --> 05:36.402
The keys were found
still in the doors.

05:36.469 --> 05:38.137
Locked from the inside.

05:39.839 --> 05:41.841
Toby! What on earth
are you doing?

05:41.908 --> 05:45.945
My screwdriver.
I just put it down there
and it's gone, it's vanished.

05:49.248 --> 05:50.349
What's that?

05:50.416 --> 05:52.351
EMF meter.

05:52.418 --> 05:56.989
Paranormal activity causes
a fluctuation in the
electro-magnetic field.

05:57.056 --> 05:59.425
Save your batteries,
Professor.

05:59.492 --> 06:04.530
The only ghost at work here
is the spirit of
Sir Isaac Newton.

06:04.597 --> 06:06.866
Gravity.
It fell and rolled away.

06:08.167 --> 06:10.703
Come on.
Let's have a look around.

06:21.047 --> 06:23.649
At least we know
Lord Marchwood was real.

06:23.716 --> 06:25.585
I've no doubt he was.

06:25.651 --> 06:27.820
And his children probably
disappeared, too.

06:27.887 --> 06:31.524
Perhaps Lord Marchwood
did spend the rest of his life
looking for his children.

06:31.591 --> 06:35.228
But the afterlife?
I doubt it.

06:35.294 --> 06:37.930
Ah, it's so sad how this house
has fallen into disrepair.

06:38.131 --> 06:40.633
It must have been
quite wonderful.

06:40.700 --> 06:44.837
Professor Rivers couldn't
have picked a creepier place
for a ghost hunt.

06:44.904 --> 06:47.173
It's felt like someone's been
watching me since we got here.

06:47.240 --> 06:50.610
It's psychological,
you know this place is
supposed to be haunted

06:50.676 --> 06:53.913
-and your imagination
starts to work overtime.
-Hmm.

06:53.980 --> 06:56.382
No wonder Luke
wanted to stay at home.

06:56.449 --> 07:01.120
I could get bored of
jumping at my own shadow
pretty fast.

07:01.187 --> 07:05.191
What about the disappearances?
An entire family
vanishes into thin air.

07:05.258 --> 07:08.227
Whether or not you believe in
ghosts, that's just sinister.

07:08.294 --> 07:11.798
I've seen so many
strange things in my life,
wonderful and frightening,

07:11.864 --> 07:15.101
yet all of it had
a scientific explanation
of some kind.

07:15.168 --> 07:18.237
The trouble with ghosts is
that there simply isn't any

07:18.304 --> 07:20.506
scientific basis
for them to exist.

07:21.140 --> 07:23.109
(BELL TOLLS)

07:23.176 --> 07:25.678
What's that?
Dinner time?

07:25.745 --> 07:27.513
I didn't see
any bell tower.

07:27.580 --> 07:30.249
That's because
there isn't one.

07:30.316 --> 07:32.018
(BELL CONTINUES RINGING)

07:42.461 --> 07:44.197
Miss Smith?

07:44.263 --> 07:47.200
Didn't you hear it?
The bell. The church bell.

07:47.266 --> 07:48.534
What bell?

07:53.639 --> 07:55.408
CLYDE:
There's no bell tower,

07:56.209 --> 07:58.144
there's nothing.

07:58.211 --> 08:00.746
But why did we hear something
like Quasimodo on a joy ride

08:00.813 --> 08:03.316
and Professor Rivers
and Toby heard nothing?

08:03.382 --> 08:05.384
It doesn't make sense.

08:05.451 --> 08:10.022
I'm telling you, I don't care
whether Sarah Jane
believes in ghosts or not,

08:10.089 --> 08:13.860
-there's something seriously
freaky about that place.
-(GROWLING)

Perfect.

09:01.007 --> 09:03.576

Look at this place,
it's beautiful.

09:04.377 --> 09:05.578
Yeah.

09:07.146 --> 09:10.516
I bet Castle Dracula looked
okay on a sunny day too.

(DOOR OPENING)

09:25.798 --> 09:27.833
-Doesn't look like
it's been used years.
-Well,

09:27.900 --> 09:32.104
...that would be because
everyone just disappears.

09:32.171 --> 09:33.940
-Are you scared?
-(SCOFFS)

09:34.006 --> 09:35.875

09:35.942 --> 09:39.412

creep in the universe, right.

09:39.478 --> 09:40.913
I ain't afraid of no ghost.

09:40.980 --> 09:42.114
Good. Come on, then.

09:47.787 --> 09:49.588
Oh...

09:49.655 --> 09:51.924
It smells like
cucumber farts in here.

09:51.991 --> 09:53.726
It's just old and damp.

09:53.793 --> 09:55.995
It must have been
wonderful here years ago.

09:56.062 --> 09:59.632
A picnic by the fountain.
Taking the boat out
on the lake.

11:29.055 --> 11:32.358
What's wrong?

11:32.425 --> 11:36.362
RIVERS: I think what you
experienced was a Stone Tape
manifestation.

11:36.429 --> 11:40.132
RANI: Some of us are a bit new
to this kind of thing,
you might need to explain.

11:40.199 --> 11:44.503
It's the theory that events
can be recorded on physical
matter, normally stone,

11:44.570 --> 11:48.040
and then, under certain
circumstances,
they get played back.

11:48.107 --> 11:51.844
It's the most convincing
explanation for most
so-called hauntings.

11:51.911 --> 11:55.147
The house is built on a giant
slab of granite bedrock,

11:55.214 --> 11:59.351
which research suggests
is a great conductor
of these psychic recordings.

11:59.418 --> 12:03.355
There are stories about the
Grey Lady that walks the
castle rampart,

12:03.422 --> 12:08.027
or sometimes a legion
of Roman centurions
marching along a road.

12:08.094 --> 12:10.262
Only people only ever
see them from the knee up.

12:10.329 --> 12:12.832
Because the Roman Roads
were lower?

12:12.898 --> 12:15.201
Exactly.

12:15.267 --> 12:19.505
I heard about this castle
where some lord was murdered
by his jealous brother.

12:19.572 --> 12:23.542
He lopped of his head
and every Halloween, it rolls
down the castle steps.

12:23.609 --> 12:26.312
The man in the mirror,
he didn't look like
any sort of recording.

12:26.378 --> 12:28.514
If it was a
disembodied spirit,

12:28.581 --> 12:31.684
let's hope he shows
up again tonight.

12:31.750 --> 12:33.752
It's after 8:00
and it's gone dark.

12:33.819 --> 12:35.521
It's time to begin
the experiment.

12:35.588 --> 12:38.124
If I could have everybody's
mobile phones, please.

12:38.190 --> 12:39.925
Our phones? What for?

12:39.992 --> 12:42.361
Mobiles can interfere
with our equipment.

12:42.428 --> 12:44.964
We can keep in touch
throughout the house
with walkie-talkies.

12:45.030 --> 12:46.732
I'd like to
speak to Luke first.

12:46.799 --> 12:48.868
And Clyde and Rani
should call their parents.

12:48.934 --> 12:53.105
Of course.
We'll be in the control hub
running final checks. Toby.

12:57.743 --> 12:59.411
Hi, Mum. Everything's cool.

Just bedding down
for the night in the
old haunted house.

13:03.048 --> 13:07.620
I haven't seen any ghosts yet
but I reckon they're
on a skeleton staff.

13:07.686 --> 13:10.623
And yes, we've had dinner,
we had ghoul-lash.

13:30.176 --> 13:32.611
Sorry. For a moment...

13:32.678 --> 13:34.346
I thought I saw...

13:34.413 --> 13:35.848
You saw what?

13:37.616 --> 13:39.885
Oh, nothing.

13:39.952 --> 13:41.854
-All cams are fine.
-Good.

13:45.224 --> 13:46.425
Oh, no.

13:49.328 --> 13:51.463
Mmm-hmm, I'll go and check it.

14:00.472 --> 14:02.942
Apparently Luke's been
driving Dad round the bend
all afternoon.

14:03.008 --> 14:05.077
What?
Luke's your dad's star pupil.

14:05.144 --> 14:08.247
-He's probably just secretly
planning your wedding.
-Ugh.

14:08.314 --> 14:10.349
Not any more. Dad taught him
to play chess today.

14:10.416 --> 14:12.451
And Luke beat him six times
before he went home.

14:12.518 --> 14:14.920

your father in pieces.

I know I did.

14:23.295 --> 14:24.630
-Please.
-It isn't.

14:24.697 --> 14:27.466
Must be a draught

That's him! That's the man
from the pavilion.

a rational explanation.

Oh, I don't think so, Rani.

managed somehow to disappear
in the blink of an eye.

The same thing
may have been happening here
for centuries.

prove yourself to your father?

the universe is very detailed

need to believe in
some sort of afterlife,

This is it.

26:19.511 --> 26:21.246
It's all for real.

26:21.313 --> 26:23.782
I guess he hasn't
been around in a while.

26:23.848 --> 26:26.551
Maybe this is the reason
for whatever's going on here.

legend is true.

did make those

27:39.157 --> 27:41.826
What was that?
The poltergeist activity.

27:41.893 --> 27:43.461
I think it's following us!

27:45.230 --> 27:46.698
CLYDE:
<i>It doesn't matter</i>
<i>what you shut out,</i>

27:46.765 --> 27:49.100
<i>you never know what you're</i>
<i>locking yourself in with.</i>
