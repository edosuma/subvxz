WEBVTT

00:02.370 --> 00:03.637
-Previously on This Is Us...
-TOBY: Plumbers are expensive.

00:03.771 --> 00:06.107
We're not exactly swimming in it
at the moment.

00:06.240 --> 00:07.408
Okay, well,
it's gonna be more expensive

00:07.541 --> 00:08.709
if there's water damage or--

00:08.842 --> 00:10.144
Kate, I'll fix it.

00:10.278 --> 00:11.479
Promise.

00:11.612 --> 00:13.581
KATE:
Sometimes I look at you, Toby,

00:13.714 --> 00:14.982
and I don't even know
who you are anymore.

00:15.116 --> 00:18.552
What is so terrible
about me right now?

00:18.686 --> 00:20.754
That I don't want to dress
like a clown?

00:20.888 --> 00:22.956
That I want to buy
a nice house for my family?

00:23.091 --> 00:25.159
-I don't know, Toby.
-Kate, what about you?

00:25.293 --> 00:27.795
You love the life
that you are living.

00:27.928 --> 00:30.064
This life that you are building
without me.

00:30.198 --> 00:32.900
Moving here is the only way
that we are gonna stay a family.

00:33.033 --> 00:35.303
It is the only option.

00:35.436 --> 00:37.671
Did you, uh,
fill Sheila's job yet?

00:37.805 --> 00:39.373
No, but we're looking
at applicants.

00:40.608 --> 00:42.776
I'd like to be considered.

00:42.910 --> 00:45.146
LUCY:
You know, you don't need
to keep using that thing.

00:45.279 --> 00:47.181
It's, like, the literal symbol

00:47.315 --> 00:49.117
of the day your mom and dad's
marriage blew up.

00:49.250 --> 00:50.951
That day
almost permanently deformed

00:51.085 --> 00:53.821
that near-perfect face of yours.

00:53.954 --> 00:56.157
-It's bright in here.
I can see some light.
-How do you--?

00:56.290 --> 00:58.859
Just a little,
and really, really

00:58.992 --> 01:00.828
blurry shapes,
but nothing clearly.

01:02.763 --> 01:04.965
KATE: I didn't say "never."
I never said never.

01:05.099 --> 01:06.667
I just said not right now,
not when we're like this.

01:06.800 --> 01:08.669
TOBY: Okay, okay, okay,
let me... let me see

01:08.802 --> 01:10.804
if I understand
your grand plan here.

01:10.938 --> 01:12.540
-KATE (sighs): Oh, my God,
can we just...
-TOBY: No, no, no, no, no.

01:12.673 --> 01:14.275
Just let me, let me map it out,

01:14.408 --> 01:16.144
let me map it out so I,
so I understand.

01:16.277 --> 01:19.046
You refuse
to move to San Francisco,

01:19.180 --> 01:21.349
but you will take a bigger
teaching job here in L.A.

01:21.482 --> 01:23.016
-How does that fix our family?!
-Two weeks ago, you were

01:23.151 --> 01:25.353
-okay with me exploring this.
-Two weeks ago, I was still

01:25.486 --> 01:27.388
in shock from your rather huge,

01:27.521 --> 01:30.358
-rather humiliating
unilateral decision.
-"Decision"?

01:30.491 --> 01:31.892
You had, you gave me an
ultimatum. You said I had to...

01:32.025 --> 01:33.127
-(loud thud)
-What was that?

01:33.261 --> 01:34.895
TOBY:
Jack?

01:35.028 --> 01:37.030
Buddy, you okay?

01:37.165 --> 01:38.799
-Hey, hey, hey.
-(Kate sighs)

01:38.932 --> 01:40.834
KATE:
Are you okay?

01:40.968 --> 01:42.903
TOBY:
Come here. What happened?

01:43.036 --> 01:44.572
What--?

01:44.705 --> 01:46.740
JACK:
I knocked something over.

01:46.874 --> 01:48.176
KATE:
That's okay. Are you okay?

01:48.309 --> 01:50.010
JACK:
Yeah.

01:50.144 --> 01:51.912
Well, hey, do you,
do you know what today is?

01:52.045 --> 01:54.382
-Saturday.
-Yeah, that's right.

01:54.515 --> 01:57.084
-And what do we do on Saturdays?
-We go to the park.

01:57.218 --> 01:59.820
-We go to the park.
-Yeah.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.555
-Park day!
-Yay!

02:02.823 --> 02:05.593
KATE:
* Saturday *

02:05.726 --> 02:07.861
* In the park *

02:07.995 --> 02:10.664
* Jack's excited
for the swing set *

02:10.798 --> 02:12.166
Move your cane
with your wrist, Jack.

02:12.300 --> 02:13.601
Good.

02:13.734 --> 02:15.836
Uh, should we be holding
both his hands?

02:15.969 --> 02:17.438
He's got to practice, though.

02:17.571 --> 02:20.741
* 12 steps to the sidewalk *

02:20.874 --> 02:24.044
* And then we make
a turn to the left *

02:24.178 --> 02:25.913
TOBY:
Jesus.

02:26.046 --> 02:27.581
* Stop at the curb *

02:27.715 --> 02:30.418
* Hop that dog turd *

02:30.551 --> 02:32.953
* That always seems
to be there *

02:33.086 --> 02:34.422
* Always seems to be there *

02:34.555 --> 02:36.624
* And listen for the cars *

02:36.757 --> 02:38.226
Yeah!

02:38.359 --> 02:40.194
Unless they're electric.
Silent killers.

02:40.328 --> 02:42.430
KATE:
Okay, join in or stop.

02:42.563 --> 02:43.797
-TOBY: Okay.
-JACK: * Step down *

02:43.931 --> 02:48.236
* Step down,
go towards the sound *

02:48.369 --> 02:51.472
* Of buzzy buzz
telephone wires *

02:51.605 --> 02:54.242
* Feel the curb, step up and *

02:54.375 --> 02:56.277
-Grr!
-* Grr *

02:56.410 --> 02:59.313
* 'Cause this one's
a little bit higher *

02:59.447 --> 03:02.250
* Jackie in his rubber boots *

03:02.383 --> 03:05.586
* For puddles, ba-ba-ba-ba *

03:05.719 --> 03:07.588
-We added a line.
What was it again?
-Yeah... (stammers)

03:07.721 --> 03:09.557
* Puddles full of wetness *

03:09.690 --> 03:11.292
* And-and sandboxes *

03:11.425 --> 03:14.161
* Full of tetanus *

03:14.295 --> 03:16.464
* Seven steps to the grass *

03:16.597 --> 03:19.099
* Now we know
that Jack has arrived. *

03:19.233 --> 03:20.501
TOBY: All right, buddy,
I'll take that.

03:20.634 --> 03:23.170
Good job.

03:23.304 --> 03:24.572
JACK:
Can I walk to the swing?

03:24.705 --> 03:26.274
-TOBY: Yeah, go, go, go.
-KATE: Yes!

03:27.541 --> 03:28.776
TOBY:
Uh-oh.

03:28.909 --> 03:30.678
-It's a bird.
-(Jack laughing)

03:30.811 --> 03:32.813
It's a plane!

03:32.946 --> 03:35.349
It's Pooper-man!

03:35.483 --> 03:37.685
-JACK: Higher!
-TOBY: Up?

03:37.818 --> 03:40.087
What do you think, Alice?

03:40.220 --> 03:42.590
-Should we zing zang zoom
this guy to the moon?
-KATE: I don't know, Ralph.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.858
-TOBY: Aah!
-(Jack laughs)

03:44.992 --> 03:47.495
This guy is a mental case.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.498
(Kate and Jack laughing)

03:53.000 --> 03:55.102
TOBY:
I missed that.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.670
Your laugh.

03:56.804 --> 03:58.739
I know. Me, too.

04:00.574 --> 04:01.809
JACK:
I need more.

04:01.942 --> 04:03.377
-He needs more.
-TOBY: Oh, you need some more?

04:03.511 --> 04:05.613
(Jack laughing)

04:05.746 --> 04:07.348
-KATE: Whoa!
-TOBY: Up!

04:07.481 --> 04:09.717
KATE:
Oh, my goodness.

04:09.850 --> 04:11.885
-TOBY: Yeah!
-KATE: Oh!

04:12.019 --> 04:14.087
* *

04:18.091 --> 04:21.128
JACK:
All right, pace it up, Picassos.
As soon as Mom is ready,

04:21.261 --> 04:22.830
and if the sitter
ever gets here,

04:22.963 --> 04:25.165
Mom and Dad are gonna
take off for a special

04:25.299 --> 04:26.700
grown-ups dinner.

04:26.834 --> 04:28.235
How do you spell "anniversary"?

04:28.369 --> 04:30.338
A-N-N-- you know what?

04:30.471 --> 04:32.406
Just look at whatever Randall
wrote. Kev, come on, man.

04:32.540 --> 04:34.375
You got to finish this stuff--
open up.

04:34.508 --> 04:36.043
I'm full.

04:36.176 --> 04:37.845
You're full? Big guy like you?

04:37.978 --> 04:39.913
No, there's got to be room
in there-- come on, dig deeper.

04:40.047 --> 04:41.349
(growls)

04:41.482 --> 04:42.783
REBECCA (singsongy):
Here I come!

04:45.953 --> 04:48.088
Oh, wowza.

04:48.221 --> 04:49.723
It's not too much?

04:49.857 --> 04:51.825
Oh, it is definitely,
definitely too much.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.427
-But happy tenth, babe.
-Happy tenth.

04:53.561 --> 04:54.862
Mm.

04:54.995 --> 04:56.430
-Hey, babe?
-Yeah?

04:56.564 --> 04:58.031
Are you warming up milk?

04:58.165 --> 04:59.333
Since when do you warm up milk?

04:59.467 --> 05:02.269
-Um...
-What did you

05:02.403 --> 05:04.505
-feed the kids for dinner?
-So much turkey.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.206
-JACK: Yeah.
-And mash potatoes.

05:06.340 --> 05:08.442
Oh, you're trying
to knock out our kids.

05:08.576 --> 05:10.911
The sooner we can get
the kids down,

05:11.044 --> 05:13.447
the sooner I can get
my foxy wife home and...

05:13.581 --> 05:15.783
And what?

05:15.916 --> 05:19.553
And... get a good night's rest.

05:19.687 --> 05:22.590
-Yes.
-Because it's been
a long time...

05:22.723 --> 05:25.292
-Since we've had
any kind of real... sleep.
-Good...

05:25.426 --> 05:27.227
-(doorbell rings)
-Sitter.

05:27.361 --> 05:29.196
Thank God!

05:30.598 --> 05:31.865
KATE:
Hey, Mom?

05:31.999 --> 05:33.801
-Hmm?
-I got it.
It's your anniversary.

05:33.934 --> 05:35.569
Today is your day.

05:35.703 --> 05:37.605
I'm just trying to help.

05:37.738 --> 05:40.307
Maybe you could help by,
uh, removing that creepy doll?

05:40.441 --> 05:41.842
It's staring at me.

05:43.243 --> 05:44.712
"Creepy"? This-this doll is

05:44.845 --> 05:46.747
-a Puerto Rican
wedding tradition.
-Mm-hmm.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.248
It's the doll
that was on our lovers' table

05:48.382 --> 05:50.484
exactly ten years ago today.

05:50.618 --> 05:51.985
I think recreating some
of our wedding moments

05:52.119 --> 05:53.621
was a very sweet idea, honey.

05:53.754 --> 05:55.389
Oh, thank you.

05:55.523 --> 05:57.224
(Jack babbling)

05:58.892 --> 06:00.628
I don't know, do you think
Miguel looks at that doll

06:00.761 --> 06:02.295
when Mom leaves town
to sort of, uh,

06:02.430 --> 06:04.164
grease the wheels?

06:04.297 --> 06:05.933
-You're disgusting. Get away.
-I'm disgust--?

06:06.066 --> 06:07.334
Miguel just said
"lovers' table."

06:07.468 --> 06:09.336
How am I disgusting?
Where's Toby, by the way?

06:09.470 --> 06:11.905
Oh, uh, well,
he's out back pretending

06:12.039 --> 06:13.574
that he doesn't know
how to light

06:13.707 --> 06:16.410
the Big Green Egg
in an effort to avoid me.

06:16.544 --> 06:18.512
But he's got the "egg-niter."

06:18.646 --> 06:20.113
You know how I know
about the egg-niter?

06:20.247 --> 06:21.415
Because he talked
about the egg-niter

06:21.549 --> 06:23.316
last egg-night, all egg-night.

06:23.451 --> 06:24.818
(laughs)

06:24.952 --> 06:26.587
Yeah.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.789
(Jack babbling)

06:28.922 --> 06:31.158
Did you and Toby get into
another fight last night?

06:31.291 --> 06:33.461
Why? What did you hear?

06:33.594 --> 06:35.429
I mean, I didn't hear anything
specific; it's just...

06:35.563 --> 06:37.297
I tried, you know,
but your walls are really thick.

06:37.431 --> 06:39.166
Well, Toby left one
of Jack's safety gates open,

06:39.299 --> 06:40.968
and I told him that he has
to listen for the click.

06:41.101 --> 06:42.770
Got to listen for the click.
If you don't hear the click--

06:42.903 --> 06:44.672
If you don't hear the click,
then it's not locked, right.

06:44.805 --> 06:46.139
So then he said
I was helicopter-parenting

06:46.273 --> 06:47.708
his parenting...

06:47.841 --> 06:49.810
I don't know, maybe I am,
but, like, he's never here.

06:49.943 --> 06:52.480
And so, you know,
that broken record

06:52.613 --> 06:55.115
skipped to our daily fight
about San Francisco.

06:55.248 --> 06:57.184
-KEVIN: Hmm.
-KATE: Hmm.

06:57.317 --> 06:59.820
Well...

06:59.953 --> 07:02.289
-now, Bug... if you need--
-Mm-mm.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.224
If you need
a little break, you're

07:04.357 --> 07:05.726
more than welcome
to come join me and Miguel

07:05.859 --> 07:07.895
at our... lovers' casa.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.997
-Give me a hug.
Bring it in for a hug.
-(laughing): Please!

07:10.130 --> 07:11.899
-Put her away.
-(Kevin laughing)

07:12.032 --> 07:14.134
-So weird!
-It is weird.

07:15.703 --> 07:18.405
What's so, uh...

07:18.539 --> 07:20.474
what's so funny
in here, huh, kids?

07:20.608 --> 07:22.409
Oh, nothing. I'm just trying
to cheer up Kate.

07:22.543 --> 07:24.478
(laughs)

07:24.612 --> 07:25.746
TOBY:
Why did--? (laughs)

07:25.879 --> 07:27.915
Why did Kate need cheering up?

07:28.048 --> 07:30.150
I don't. He's just an idiot.

07:30.283 --> 07:31.652
-You're an idiot.
-Yeah, I'm an idiot.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.487
I'm an idiot
with his bags packed, though.

07:33.621 --> 07:35.255
Did you see that,
I got my bags packed?

07:35.388 --> 07:37.891
Escrow closes tomorrow
on my new house.

07:38.025 --> 07:40.393
And I will be
out of your hair for good.

07:40.528 --> 07:43.263
-HAILEY (crying): Mommy!
-Oh, I'll get Hailey.

07:43.396 --> 07:44.598
-Kev, can you actually get--?
-I'm on it. I hear.

07:44.732 --> 07:47.334
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
-KATE: Thanks.

07:47.467 --> 07:50.270
Come on, hon, let's go see if
we can whip up some rum punch.

07:50.403 --> 07:52.239
-I'm just trying to help.
-I know.

07:52.372 --> 07:54.174
(Jack babbling)

07:57.678 --> 07:59.847
Hey, thank you so much
for doing this party.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.515
Yeah, of course, um...

08:01.649 --> 08:02.916
Uh, seriously, though,
what-what were you two

08:03.050 --> 08:04.718
laughing about when I came in?

08:04.852 --> 08:07.354
I don't... (laughs)
That doll.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.690
Did you tell him
about our fight?

08:09.823 --> 08:12.225
He could hear us.

08:12.359 --> 08:13.894
Okay.

08:14.027 --> 08:15.629
Wait, Toby, come on,
I-I thought that

08:15.763 --> 08:17.898
we were just gonna try
to have, like, one nice day.

08:18.031 --> 08:20.901
I'm just going to smoke
Miguel's meat.

08:21.034 --> 08:23.470
That came out weird, but yeah.

08:23.604 --> 08:25.706
-JACK: Hey, Mama.
-(door opens and closes)

08:25.839 --> 08:27.708
Walk to the park.

08:27.841 --> 08:28.942
You know what, Jackie, we can't.

08:29.076 --> 08:31.712
But it's Saturday.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.146
-I know, I know.
-(doorbell rings)

08:33.280 --> 08:34.782
Open the door with you, Mama?

08:34.915 --> 08:36.917
Okay.

08:37.050 --> 08:38.952
-Okay, let's go.
-All right.

08:39.086 --> 08:42.890
KATE:
Okay, unlock it.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.292
Your hand.
There we go. Go for it.

08:45.425 --> 08:46.927
-JACK: Opened that door.
-KATE: Good job.

08:47.060 --> 08:48.896
-RANDALL: Oh, there's my nephew!
-BETH: Hey!

08:49.029 --> 08:51.732
-Hi.
-KATE: Hi. Hi.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.001
I still can't believe you came
all this way for a barbecue.

08:54.134 --> 08:56.136
-Me, neither.
-RANDALL: For Mom and Miguel's

08:56.269 --> 08:58.005
tenth anniversary party,
come on!

08:58.138 --> 08:59.840
-We wouldn't miss it.
-BETH: Our hormonal girls,

08:59.973 --> 09:01.842
on the other hand, opted
to stay at home with my mom

09:01.975 --> 09:03.844
and get their knuckles slapped.

09:03.977 --> 09:05.779
Well, I'm really glad
that you're here.

09:05.913 --> 09:07.581
RANDALL:
Aw, glad to be here.

09:08.782 --> 09:10.851
Okay, we're hugging again.

09:10.984 --> 09:13.020
That's cool. It's cool.

09:13.153 --> 09:15.188
We're doing a long one. Yeah.

09:15.322 --> 09:17.457
Oh, with a little bit
of rocking.

09:17.591 --> 09:19.760
-Yeah.
-Jack?

09:19.893 --> 09:22.529
Hey, let's go
to the kitchen, bud.

09:22.663 --> 09:25.532
-Let's, uh, let this happen.
-RANDALL: Okay.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.701
Hey, what's going on?

09:27.835 --> 09:29.369
I can't handle it, Randall.

09:29.502 --> 09:31.371
I can't.

09:31.504 --> 09:33.874
Every day, I wake up
and I think, "Okay,

09:34.007 --> 09:36.309
today's the day that
Toby and I aren't gonna fight."

09:36.443 --> 09:38.612
And then there's
trip wires everywhere.

09:38.746 --> 09:41.615
(exhales) God, and Kevin,
he's driving him crazy.

09:41.749 --> 09:44.217
Honestly, I think that Toby
might kill him,

09:44.351 --> 09:45.418
and I don't want him
to kill him.

09:45.552 --> 09:47.621
-Tell me what to do.
-Take Kevin out of here.

09:47.755 --> 09:49.690
Go pick up the twins early
from Madison's or something.

09:49.823 --> 09:51.391
Just take a long time, please.

09:51.524 --> 09:53.126
I got you. Hey.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.728
You guys are gonna make it
through this.

09:54.862 --> 09:56.997
You hear me?

09:57.130 --> 09:58.365
You want me to get Beth
out of here, too?

09:58.498 --> 10:00.233
What? No.

10:00.367 --> 10:02.636
She's, like, the least stressful
person in this whole family. No.

10:02.770 --> 10:05.472
-Try not to create
a lot of stress.
-BETH: Kate?

10:05.605 --> 10:07.675
-Yeah?
-Little issue in here.

10:08.709 --> 10:11.144
Oopsie.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.746
KATE:
Great.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.547
This feels about right.

10:14.682 --> 10:15.883
(sighs)

10:21.689 --> 10:23.423
Oh, my God, this place, Jack.

10:23.556 --> 10:26.193
When the girl hung up my coat
back there, I almost cried.

10:26.326 --> 10:28.495
I mean, I can't tell you

10:28.628 --> 10:30.931
the last time someone actually
hung up my coat for me.

10:31.064 --> 10:33.433
-Wow, cheap date.
-I mean, this is

10:33.566 --> 10:35.903
my first night out
in almost six years.

10:36.036 --> 10:38.605
You are the greatest husband.
This is the greatest restaurant.

10:38.739 --> 10:40.674
-It's gonna be
the greatest night of my life.
-Okay.

10:40.808 --> 10:42.109
-No pressure.
-No pressure.

10:42.242 --> 10:43.711
-(Rebecca chuckles)
-Well, hello.

10:43.844 --> 10:45.679
-BOTH: Hi.
-Can I start you guys
with a drink?

10:45.813 --> 10:47.681
Uh, yes, please.

10:47.815 --> 10:50.583
Um, do you happen to serve
drinks with adorable names?

10:50.718 --> 10:54.521
-I thought I heard you serve
drinks with adorable names.
-Yes.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.790
Well, our signature drinks are:
Between the Sheets,

10:56.924 --> 10:58.558
Blue Lagoon, Dirty Banana,

10:58.692 --> 11:00.360
Fluffy Duck, Fuzzy Navel,

11:00.493 --> 11:02.262
-Jungle Bird--
-Yes.

11:02.395 --> 11:03.864
Yes?

11:03.997 --> 11:06.700
Yes to all of them, one by one.

11:06.834 --> 11:08.902
-Thank you.
-I'll have a beer.

11:09.036 --> 11:10.203
-You got it.
-Thank you.

11:10.337 --> 11:11.905
(sighs) Hi.

11:12.039 --> 11:14.274
I am carefree, childless

11:14.407 --> 11:16.076
-Rebecca Malone--
do you remember me?
-Yeah, faintly.

11:16.209 --> 11:18.311
I...

11:18.445 --> 11:21.114
am gonna rock
your world tonight, babe.

11:22.382 --> 11:23.717
I'm gonna get the check now.

11:23.851 --> 11:26.754
(both laugh)

11:26.887 --> 11:29.222
Mommy and Daddy usually
put us to sleep at 8:00,

11:29.356 --> 11:31.091
but now it's 8:34
because we were too excited

11:31.224 --> 11:33.093
because tonight is
a special night

11:33.226 --> 11:34.461
because we all get to sleep
together.

11:34.594 --> 11:35.963
All right, Chatty Cathy.

11:36.096 --> 11:37.297
Time to find your off switch.

11:37.430 --> 11:39.299
I mean, geez.

11:39.432 --> 11:42.469
He-Man, G.I. Joe,
you ready for lights-out?

11:42.602 --> 11:44.337
No! I'm not tired!
I'm not going to sleep!

11:44.471 --> 11:46.073
Come on, Kevin, it's bedtime.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.675
No. I don't like you.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.243
JOANIE:
Well, I don't care. Bedtime.

11:50.377 --> 11:51.611
I said no.

11:53.413 --> 11:54.915
I didn't know things
had gotten so bad

11:55.048 --> 11:56.516
-between Kate and Toby.
-Yeah, man.

11:56.649 --> 11:59.119
It's not very good.

11:59.252 --> 12:01.288
(doorbell rings)

12:03.223 --> 12:05.258
-What are we doing?
-Oh, yeah, no, I don't use
my house key here anymore.

12:05.392 --> 12:06.960
Out of respect.

12:07.094 --> 12:08.295
For the mother of my children.

12:08.428 --> 12:09.930
-Got ya.
-Yeah.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.331
Well, Kate stuff aside,

12:11.464 --> 12:13.100
you seem to be doing
pretty well, Kev.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.367
Thanks, yeah.

12:14.501 --> 12:16.804
Putting down some roots,
you know, solid base.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.505
-I'm at peace
with my life, you know?
-Yeah.

12:18.638 --> 12:20.640
Plus my new place
has those fancy toilets.

12:20.774 --> 12:22.309
You know, the ones that spray,
so you barely have to wipe?

12:22.442 --> 12:24.144
-Got one of 'em.
-I know you do.

12:24.277 --> 12:25.478
-Hey!
-Hi.

12:25.612 --> 12:26.679
-How are you?
-Come in.

12:26.814 --> 12:28.348
-Thank you.
-RANDALL: Madison!

12:28.481 --> 12:30.283
MADISON:
Randall!

12:30.417 --> 12:31.952
(twins laughing)

12:32.085 --> 12:33.553
Oh, my goodness, look at these

12:33.686 --> 12:35.622
beautiful babies.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.057
Beautiful, right?
Hey, you taking them out?

12:37.190 --> 12:39.026
Yeah, we are off to music class.

12:39.159 --> 12:40.193
You are two hours early, dude.

12:40.327 --> 12:41.795
KEVIN:
I... Yeah, I know, I know.

12:41.929 --> 12:44.497
Kate kicked me out. She thought
Toby was gonna murder me.

12:44.631 --> 12:45.732
How'd you know
she was worried about that?

12:45.866 --> 12:48.668
We're twins.
It's that ESP thing.

12:48.802 --> 12:50.003
Plus I-I heard her tell you.

12:50.137 --> 12:52.005
-That sounds right, yeah.
-Yep.

12:52.139 --> 12:53.740
Well, I can drop them off
at the party later.

12:53.874 --> 12:55.142
Yeah? That sounds good. Okay.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.844
Hey, I saw Elijah's car.

12:56.977 --> 12:58.778
You want to meet Elijah?
It's Madison's new beau.

13:00.013 --> 13:03.050
Our dynamic is super weird,
and it's wildly uncomfortable.

13:03.183 --> 13:05.585
-It's true.
-Can't wait.

13:05.718 --> 13:07.087
MADISON:
Well, I'm sorry
I have to miss that.

13:07.220 --> 13:08.355
RANDALL:
Well, let me help you

13:08.488 --> 13:10.090
-with this monster stroller.
-Thank you.

13:10.223 --> 13:12.159
-And Elijah's where?
-Uh, in my bedroom.

13:12.292 --> 13:13.593
Okay, all right.
Be good to your mom.

13:13.726 --> 13:15.528
-Say, "Bye-bye, Daddy."
-Okay, bye!

13:15.662 --> 13:17.898
-RANDALL: My goodness,
these kids are growing!
-MADISON: I know.

13:24.037 --> 13:26.506
Hey, man, what are you doing?

13:26.639 --> 13:28.175
Hi there.

13:29.409 --> 13:31.278
-Yeah, so I know
what this looks like.
-Well... (stammers)

13:31.411 --> 13:33.113
...it looks like you're
stealing Madison's jewelry.

13:33.246 --> 13:35.849
Yeah, yeah, I know, but it's
not that at all, I swear.

13:37.050 --> 13:39.052
-So how are you?
-Me?

13:39.186 --> 13:40.587
I'm good, I'm good.
What-what...?

13:40.720 --> 13:43.523
What's under your shirt?

13:43.656 --> 13:45.425
Uh...

13:48.095 --> 13:49.897
Okay, look, it's...

13:50.030 --> 13:53.066
Wow, I look like a real pervy
thief, don't I? But I'm not.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.435
It's a, um...

13:55.568 --> 13:57.004
ring sizer.

13:59.506 --> 14:01.441
Oh.

14:01.574 --> 14:04.144
Oh, oh, yeah, you're, you're,
you're gonna, uh...

14:04.277 --> 14:06.779
Yeah, yeah.

14:06.914 --> 14:08.415
-KATE: This isn't
happening right now.
-TOBY: Okay.

14:08.548 --> 14:09.716
Can you just move that towel
so I can get up there?

14:09.849 --> 14:12.252
-Here's some towels.
-No, not the good towels.

14:12.385 --> 14:14.821
Well, yeah,
I can wash them afterwards.

14:14.955 --> 14:16.723
-Hey, Kate, I'm gonna
turn off this stove, okay?
-Okay. Thank you.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.558
Hey, uh, Toby, I don't think
it's a good idea

14:18.691 --> 14:21.128
to open that up right now.

14:21.261 --> 14:23.330
-KATE: Stay right here.
-Yeah, we need to turn the
water off to the house first.

14:23.463 --> 14:25.265
-Yeah.
-Wait, so we're not
gonna have water?

14:25.398 --> 14:26.934
Toby, I begged you to call
the plumber about this.

14:27.067 --> 14:28.835
We couldn't afford it
then, okay?

14:28.969 --> 14:31.271
Okay, so now we have
a more expensive problem.

14:31.404 --> 14:32.639
TOBY:
It's good thing I have
such a high-paying

14:32.772 --> 14:33.740
job that you resent so much.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.308
You know what, Miguel?

14:35.442 --> 14:37.477
Can you please help my wife
with this since she thinks

14:37.610 --> 14:39.812
-I can't take care of it?
I'm gonna go check on the grill.
-Yeah, sure.

14:39.947 --> 14:42.315
REBECCA:
Hey, sweetheart, it's just,
it's a leak, it's okay.

14:42.449 --> 14:44.184
Toby, can you please
take Jack with you?

14:44.317 --> 14:45.785
It's a little slippery in here.

14:45.919 --> 14:47.187
And make sure that you close
the gate to the--

14:47.320 --> 14:49.422
I know, until it clicks!
I got it.

14:49.556 --> 14:52.092
Can I put shoes on him first,
please?

14:52.225 --> 14:53.927
At least let me do that.

14:54.061 --> 14:56.763
(Jack crying)

14:56.896 --> 14:58.598
Come on, sweetheart.

14:58.731 --> 15:00.900
Let's go put your shoes on.
Come on.

15:04.004 --> 15:05.338
(door slams, rattles)

15:10.743 --> 15:12.679
Here.

15:12.812 --> 15:14.647
Miguel made 'em.

15:14.781 --> 15:16.383
I don't know what's in this,

15:16.516 --> 15:18.986
-but it's getting the job done.
-Okay.

15:20.020 --> 15:21.654
(slurps)

15:21.788 --> 15:23.856
So, this is the famous

15:23.991 --> 15:26.159
Big Green Egg, huh?

15:26.293 --> 15:28.461
Did it come
with a big green ham? (chuckles)

15:28.595 --> 15:30.363
You know, like--
Because Green Eggs and-- No?

15:30.497 --> 15:32.199
You're not in the mood?
I feel you.

15:32.332 --> 15:33.833
I liked-- I liked it. Sorry.

15:33.967 --> 15:36.036
Sor-- And sorry for the scene
in there.

15:36.169 --> 15:38.205
You know,
every time I walk into a room

15:38.338 --> 15:40.907
with Kate in it, I tell myself,
"Toby, be light.

15:41.041 --> 15:42.209
Be playful." And then I just--

15:42.342 --> 15:43.910
-I lose myself.
-Oh, please.

15:44.044 --> 15:45.212
I blame Kevin, okay?

15:45.345 --> 15:46.813
He came to live with us
for a year,

15:46.946 --> 15:47.981
and I nearly killed Randall.

15:48.115 --> 15:50.350
Kev can drive a person crazy.

15:51.551 --> 15:53.486
Hey, Toblerone.

15:53.620 --> 15:56.089
I know it's none of my business,
but, you know,

15:56.223 --> 15:58.225
uh, Randall and I did the
long-distance thing for a while,

15:58.358 --> 16:00.493
when he was campaigning
in Philly,

16:00.627 --> 16:01.861
and...

16:01.995 --> 16:03.530
it's a bitch.
Yeah, I'm not gonna lie to you.

16:03.663 --> 16:07.100
But, uh, we made it through.

16:07.234 --> 16:08.868
Yeah, I think the difference
is... (sighs)

16:09.002 --> 16:11.271
you moved for him, Beth.

16:11.404 --> 16:12.539
Well, I moved for myself.

16:12.672 --> 16:14.674
And for work.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.676
-And for...
-For your marriage.

16:18.978 --> 16:21.214
* *

16:23.850 --> 16:26.186
REBECCA:
Hey, Jack. Your shoes
are lined up so neatly.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.055
-Oh, yeah.
-(chuckles softly)

16:28.188 --> 16:30.290
-They are.
-Did your mommy do it?

16:30.423 --> 16:32.425
Yes. These ones,

16:32.559 --> 16:35.195
high-tops. Low-tops.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.697
Rubber boots.

16:37.830 --> 16:40.533
Dressy shoes.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.802
I hate dressy shoes.

16:42.935 --> 16:44.804
Yeah. I hate dressy shoes, too.

16:44.937 --> 16:46.606
They're very uncomfy.
(chuckles softly)

16:47.874 --> 16:49.909
So which ones should we wear
to the barbecue, you think?

16:50.043 --> 16:53.146
Should we wear the rubber boots?

16:53.280 --> 16:55.448
Oh, but they're for
muddy puddles.

16:55.582 --> 16:56.983
-Okay?
-Oh,

16:57.117 --> 16:58.985
rubber boots
are for muddy puddles.

16:59.119 --> 17:01.588
-Okay.
-Yeah. For the park.

17:02.755 --> 17:03.756
Grandma, are you sad?

17:05.125 --> 17:05.992
(clicks tongue)
Honey.

17:06.126 --> 17:08.228
You know what? I...
(sighs)

17:08.361 --> 17:10.763
I just-- I want to feel useful.

17:10.897 --> 17:13.233
And Grandma does not feel
very useful today.

17:15.435 --> 17:16.503
Oh, yeah.

17:16.636 --> 17:17.504
Is Jackie sad?

17:17.637 --> 17:19.272
Jackie's sad.

17:19.406 --> 17:21.674
Mommy and Daddy are mad a lot.

17:21.808 --> 17:23.510
Mommy and Daddy
are mad a lot?

17:23.643 --> 17:24.911
Yeah.

17:26.479 --> 17:29.916
Well, mommies and daddies
fight sometimes.

17:30.049 --> 17:32.219
But it's gonna be okay.

17:33.920 --> 17:35.955
Okay.

17:37.290 --> 17:38.991
These ones.

17:39.126 --> 17:41.494
-Low-tops.
-Low-tops.

17:41.628 --> 17:43.163
You got it.

17:44.597 --> 17:45.832
Let's put these on then.
Come on.

17:51.638 --> 17:53.940
-(slurping) Mmm!
-There you are. (chuckles)

17:54.073 --> 17:55.342
-Must be a good one. (chuckles)
-REBECCA: Hmm.

17:55.475 --> 17:56.376
-(waiter chuckles)
-(slurping continues)

17:56.509 --> 17:57.810
Mmm.

17:57.944 --> 17:58.845
Good to the last drop.

17:58.978 --> 18:00.180
(waiter chuckles)

18:00.313 --> 18:02.315
-Thank you! (chuckles)
-No problem.

18:02.449 --> 18:04.717
-Wow. Beautiful.
-Hey.

18:04.851 --> 18:07.320
Bec, may-maybe you should
slow down a little bit?

18:07.454 --> 18:09.289
I think maybe you should
slow down a little.

18:09.422 --> 18:12.492
(chuckles) I think maybe
that doesn't, uh, make any sense

18:12.625 --> 18:14.227
-because I'm still on
my first drink.
-Mmm.

18:14.361 --> 18:15.495
Mmm.

18:15.628 --> 18:18.198
To ten amazing years.

18:18.331 --> 18:19.699
Yes.

18:19.832 --> 18:21.701
-Mmm.
-Ten amazing years.

18:21.834 --> 18:24.537
Where do you think we're gonna
be ten years from now, babe?

18:24.671 --> 18:26.539
Probably still at this table,
waiting for our food.

18:27.774 --> 18:30.177
(laughing loudly)

18:31.544 --> 18:32.645
(chuckles)

18:32.779 --> 18:34.247
(laughing)

18:34.381 --> 18:35.982
(sighs)
Mmm.

18:36.949 --> 18:38.718
I know what I should do.

18:38.851 --> 18:39.986
Huh?

18:40.119 --> 18:42.489
I should cut my hair short,

18:42.622 --> 18:43.590
like Princess Diana.

18:43.723 --> 18:45.392
(laughs)

18:45.525 --> 18:48.428
Uh, yeah, I'm gonna go get you
some bread.

18:48.561 --> 18:49.929
I don't want bread.

18:50.062 --> 18:51.063
-Mr. Pearson?
-Yeah.

18:51.198 --> 18:53.065
-Your babysitter.
-Oh.

18:54.201 --> 18:56.336
Joanie?

18:56.469 --> 18:58.838
It's crazy. It's just--
The whole thing is crazy.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.907
-You know?
They've been dating six months.
-(Randall sighs)

19:01.040 --> 19:02.742
RANDALL:
I think a good thing to focus on

19:02.875 --> 19:04.411
is that, 20 minutes ago,

19:04.544 --> 19:06.579
you were feeling at peace
with your life.

19:06.713 --> 19:08.415
Yeah, well, my life
just changed pretty radically.

19:08.548 --> 19:09.949
Did it?

19:10.082 --> 19:12.419
Just picture yourself at
your wedding, all right?

19:12.552 --> 19:16.122
When she asked you
if you were in love with her,

19:16.256 --> 19:18.258
-would your answer be
any different now?
-(tapping)

19:19.492 --> 19:20.593
(sighs)

19:21.994 --> 19:24.364
I don't know.

19:24.497 --> 19:26.766
-(exhales)
-I don't kn-- I know I'm not
the same person I was back then.

19:26.899 --> 19:27.934
I'm a father now.
That changes you.

19:28.067 --> 19:29.736
-You know that.
-Sure.

19:29.869 --> 19:32.539
And-and, you know...
(sighs)

19:32.672 --> 19:34.307
You saw us together.
We're-we're relaxed,

19:34.441 --> 19:35.908
we're good, we're--
We laugh together.

19:36.042 --> 19:37.710
We-we genuinely enjoy
each other's company.

19:37.844 --> 19:39.746
-You're very cute.
-You know? And the idea

19:39.879 --> 19:41.914
of her marrying somebody else

19:42.048 --> 19:43.783
just makes me feel...

19:45.752 --> 19:47.687
...not good.

19:49.256 --> 19:51.391
So, you know,

19:51.524 --> 19:53.125
-maybe that means...
-Maybe we should
just keep driving

19:53.260 --> 19:56.095
until that thought
leaves your mind.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.068
'Kay. Maybe I should
just text her right now,

20:02.201 --> 20:04.003
-just real quick...
-Stop.

20:04.136 --> 20:05.505
Kevin, you're a 41-year-old man

20:05.638 --> 20:06.939
who makes
rash romantic decisions

20:07.073 --> 20:09.108
that reverberate for decades.

20:09.242 --> 20:12.979
Okay? Now, we're gonna go
on a nice scenic drive,

20:13.112 --> 20:15.515
maybe stop for some boba tea
and not send

20:15.648 --> 20:18.818
a self-destructive text message
to your baby mama.

20:20.152 --> 20:21.954
I'm starting to realize
why your kids didn't want to go

20:22.088 --> 20:23.323
on this trip with you, Randall.

20:23.456 --> 20:25.358
I love you, too.

20:25.492 --> 20:26.859
(sizzling)

20:26.993 --> 20:29.362
(Jack panting)

20:29.496 --> 20:31.030
Whoa, whoa, whoa, buddy.
Don't get too close.

20:31.163 --> 20:32.965
(grunts)
Huh? It's very hot.

20:33.099 --> 20:34.100
You want to do some cooking
with me?

20:34.233 --> 20:35.802
-Yeah.
-Okay.

20:36.803 --> 20:38.037
Oh. You smell that?

20:38.170 --> 20:39.205
-Oh, yeah!
-Take a...

20:39.339 --> 20:40.473
-I...
-Yeah. Take a whiff.

20:40.607 --> 20:42.875
What does that smell like?
(inhales deeply)

20:43.009 --> 20:46.178
It smells like apples and pants.

20:46.313 --> 20:48.348
It does smell like apples
and pants.

20:48.481 --> 20:50.350
That's very good.

20:51.618 --> 20:53.486
No, you're actually on
West Ladera.

20:53.620 --> 20:55.154
You're supposed
to be on East Ladera.

20:55.288 --> 20:56.723
Yes. Just please--
Please just hurry.

20:56.856 --> 20:59.225
Yes, pl-- Thank you.
Plumber's lost.

20:59.359 --> 21:02.028
Hey, Kate,
we can just cancel this party.

21:02.161 --> 21:04.697
It's only some of my bridge
friends and his golf buddies,

21:04.831 --> 21:06.466
-who I don't even like
very much.
-What?

21:06.599 --> 21:07.634
KATE:
Absolutely not, Mom.
I want to do this for you.

21:07.767 --> 21:10.002
(loud creaking)

21:11.671 --> 21:13.406
Hey, hey, hey. Who's in here
banging pots and pans

21:13.540 --> 21:15.842
while I'm trying
to put Hailey down? Ooh.

21:15.975 --> 21:18.478
There's some bad spirits
up in here.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.813
(crackling thud,
liquid splashing)

21:20.947 --> 21:22.415
BETH:
Dear Lord.

21:22.549 --> 21:24.417
-Oh, shoot.
-KATE: Oh, wow. Well,

21:24.551 --> 21:26.653
Toby's always wanted
a frickin' waterbed.

21:26.786 --> 21:28.054
-Well, I'm gonna go get him.
-Okay.
-You've got to get

21:28.187 --> 21:30.156
-this mattress
off of here quick.
-Yeah, I guess.

21:30.289 --> 21:31.558
BETH:
Hey, Toby.

21:31.691 --> 21:32.992
We need you inside.

21:33.125 --> 21:36.195
(sighs) All right,
come on, buddy. Let's go.

21:38.565 --> 21:40.367
-TOBY: Hey, where are you guys?
-(babbling)

21:40.500 --> 21:42.769
Where are you guys?
(giggles)

21:42.902 --> 21:44.571
TOBY:
Oh, my--

21:44.704 --> 21:46.939
What is this? I thought you said
you turned the water off.

21:47.073 --> 21:48.941
I did, Toby, but obviously
enough water was already pumped

21:49.075 --> 21:50.843
into the pipes that it
just blew the ceiling in.

21:50.977 --> 21:52.745
KATE:
Can you just help us instead of,

21:52.879 --> 21:54.514
like, you know, running
your colorful commentary, Toby?

21:54.647 --> 21:56.583
Yeah, let me just,
let me put Jack down.

21:56.716 --> 21:59.018
I got to find Beth. Hey, Beth?

21:59.151 --> 22:00.520
-JACK: Beth?
-Beth... (sighs)

22:00.653 --> 22:02.689
Okay.

22:02.822 --> 22:04.290
(Jack babbling)

22:04.424 --> 22:06.759
-Beth?
-(shushes) I got Hailey.

22:06.893 --> 22:09.061
Yeah, sorry. Okay.

22:09.195 --> 22:11.731
All right, buddy, you, um, you
got to go to your room, okay?

22:11.864 --> 22:14.367
-Here you go.
-KATE: Toby,
where the hell are you?

22:14.501 --> 22:15.702
-TOBY: Stay put, okay?
-My 70-year-old mother

22:15.835 --> 22:17.269
-is picking up this mattress!
-Stay right here.

22:17.404 --> 22:19.539
-I'm coming! Relax.
-KATE: It's heavy. Be careful.

22:19.672 --> 22:21.908
TOBY:
Okay, all right, just slide it,
slide it towards the...

22:22.041 --> 22:23.543
-Toward-towards the window.
-KATE: Get it straight.
-REBECCA: Hey, hey, hey.

22:23.676 --> 22:24.911
-REBECCA: It's, uh...
-TOBY: All right, we have to

22:25.044 --> 22:26.413
-move the bedframe.
-KATE: Yeah, I-I got that.

22:26.546 --> 22:27.780
TOBY:
Here, just get it out
from under...

22:27.914 --> 22:28.881
-(doorbell ringing)
-KATE: Move it forward

22:29.015 --> 22:29.982
so you can open the door.

22:30.116 --> 22:31.718
TOBY:
Would you get the door?

22:31.851 --> 22:32.885
KATE:
Coming!

22:36.022 --> 22:38.090
TOBY:
Slide it towards the...

22:38.224 --> 22:40.159
Oh, thank God. I could hug you.

22:40.292 --> 22:42.161
You want to show me
where the leak is?

22:42.294 --> 22:43.295
Oh, yeah, come in.

22:44.764 --> 22:47.266
All right, so,
it started in the kitchen.

22:47.400 --> 22:48.435
-PLUMBER: Uh-huh.
-Um...

22:50.603 --> 22:51.938
...right here.

23:04.116 --> 23:05.918
(birds chirping, cars passing)

23:17.163 --> 23:19.198
(leaves crunching)

23:19.331 --> 23:23.002
JACK:
* Saturday in the park *

23:23.135 --> 23:26.573
* Jack's excited
for the swing set. *

23:29.108 --> 23:31.077
* *

23:37.684 --> 23:39.018
Jack?

23:41.287 --> 23:44.290
Jack? Jack?

23:44.423 --> 23:45.958
KATE:
See, the back, just, is ruined.

23:46.092 --> 23:47.894
TOBY:
Jack-- Hey, is, uh,
is Jack in here with you?

23:48.027 --> 23:49.529
-What? Wh...
-Jack?

23:49.662 --> 23:51.197
-What are you talking about?
-Buddy?

23:51.330 --> 23:53.332
-Toby.
-Jack?

23:53.466 --> 23:56.368
-Huh? Answer me, Jack.
-Toby, what the hell
is happening?

23:56.503 --> 23:58.037
-Jack? Where are you?
-Toby, where did you leave him?

23:58.170 --> 24:01.173
I-I thought that I closed
the gate all the way.

24:04.010 --> 24:05.745
KATE:
Jack?

24:05.878 --> 24:08.014
(panting)

24:08.147 --> 24:10.016
-(exhales)
-REBECCA: What's wrong?

24:10.149 --> 24:11.017
-We can't find Jack.
-TOBY: Buddy?

24:11.150 --> 24:12.251
REBECCA:
What?

24:12.384 --> 24:14.086
No, no, no, no.
That-that can't be true.

24:14.220 --> 24:16.489
-He's got to be here somewhere.
-I'll look in the backyard.

24:16.623 --> 24:18.725
-MIGUEL: Jack?
-REBECCA: Hey, hey, bud?

24:30.169 --> 24:33.205
* Feel the curb,
listen for cars to pass by. *

24:41.881 --> 24:43.182
(vehicle approaches)

24:46.919 --> 24:48.254
-MIGUEL: Hey, Jack!
-BETH: Jack!

24:49.556 --> 24:51.758
-Jack?
-Jack!

24:51.891 --> 24:53.560
-TOBY: Jack!
-Jack?

24:53.693 --> 24:55.094
Hey, can you check
with that neighbor?

24:55.227 --> 24:56.395
I'm gonna see
if he's at Gregory's.

24:56.529 --> 24:57.530
Jack!

24:59.031 --> 25:00.967
He's not here.
He's not anywhere.

25:01.100 --> 25:02.769
REBECCA:
Okay, okay, stop and think.

25:02.902 --> 25:04.370
Do you guys play hide-and-seek?

25:04.503 --> 25:06.272
-Uh...
-Does he have
any-any hiding spots?

25:06.405 --> 25:07.540
(sighs)

25:07.674 --> 25:09.576
I'm gonna, I'm gonna
check outside.

25:09.709 --> 25:10.943
Okay.

25:22.722 --> 25:25.958
JACK:
* Down, down, walk sound *

25:26.092 --> 25:28.795
* Buzzy buzz telephone wires. *

25:28.928 --> 25:30.730
(electrical buzzing)

25:33.099 --> 25:35.234
Jack? Where are you, babe?

25:35.367 --> 25:37.637
-Jack?
-TOBY: He's not at Gregory's.

25:37.770 --> 25:39.105
Toby, the front door
was unlocked.

25:39.238 --> 25:40.640
I let the plumber in,
and I-I don't think...

25:40.773 --> 25:42.141
I didn't-- I didn't lock it.

25:42.274 --> 25:43.676
We're gonna find him.
I'm gonna go look around

25:43.810 --> 25:45.612
-the neighborhood.
-I'm gonna call the police.

25:48.280 --> 25:50.316
REBECCA:
Hey, Jack?

25:50.449 --> 25:53.853
Honey? Hey, bud,
you're not in trouble.

25:53.986 --> 25:55.521
You can come out now, okay?

25:55.655 --> 25:57.624
Jack?

25:57.757 --> 25:59.125
(exhales)

26:06.265 --> 26:08.200
The boots. The boots.

26:08.334 --> 26:10.169
Okay. Mm-hmm.

26:10.302 --> 26:12.471
-He went to the park!
-What?

26:12.605 --> 26:14.774
He's at the park.

26:14.907 --> 26:16.475
He went to the park.

26:25.484 --> 26:27.519
(babbles)

26:32.825 --> 26:34.326
(cane drops to ground)

26:45.471 --> 26:47.907
(panting, giggling)

26:48.040 --> 26:49.341
(squeals)

26:49.475 --> 26:50.743
(thuds)

26:50.877 --> 26:52.945
* *

26:55.547 --> 26:56.949
Jack!

26:58.685 --> 27:01.220
Jack?

27:01.353 --> 27:03.255
(panting)

27:03.389 --> 27:05.157
Jack?

27:06.192 --> 27:07.794
(Jack crying)

27:09.996 --> 27:12.832
Oh, Jack. That's my grandson.

27:12.965 --> 27:14.400
Jack.

27:14.533 --> 27:16.502
Hey, hey, buddy.
Hey, buddy, Grandma's here.

27:16.635 --> 27:18.537
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

27:18.671 --> 27:21.207
Grandma's got you now.
It's okay.

27:21.340 --> 27:23.109
It's okay, Jack,
you-you're all right.

27:23.242 --> 27:25.277
-Let me see. Let me see,
can I look at your head?
-What was-- What was that?

27:25.411 --> 27:27.213
REBECCA:
Can I look at your head?

27:27.346 --> 27:29.081
(kisses)
You're okay. Come here.

27:29.215 --> 27:31.050
Grandma's here.
It's okay, honey.

27:31.183 --> 27:33.219
It's okay, honey.
(exhales)

27:39.658 --> 27:41.293
-Kids!
-(low-pitched): Kids!

27:41.427 --> 27:44.196
(regular pitch):
Oh, Daddy is so mad.

27:44.330 --> 27:47.333
You guys are in so much trouble.

27:49.035 --> 27:50.402
Oh, God.

27:52.604 --> 27:54.640
I am sorry. I am so sorry.

27:54.774 --> 27:56.909
Look, I'm sure the kids
were just playing around.

27:57.043 --> 27:58.410
Hey, h-how about an extra ten?

27:58.544 --> 27:59.979
Yeah, I was locked in there
for over an hour.

28:00.112 --> 28:01.380
Oh, no, you're-you're right.

28:01.513 --> 28:03.449
H-H-How about 20? 20?

28:03.582 --> 28:06.719
I-- Please just don't
tell your friends.

28:06.853 --> 28:09.288
-So, what happened?
-REBECCA: Mmm.

28:09.421 --> 28:12.391
These potatoes are lumpy,
and I like them.

28:12.524 --> 28:14.727
KATE:
What's wrong with Mommy?

28:14.861 --> 28:16.495
Two Fluffy Ducks
and a Dirty Banana.

28:16.628 --> 28:18.998
Now answer Daddy.

28:19.131 --> 28:20.599
Joanie was mean.

28:20.733 --> 28:22.401
REBECCA:
What do you mean, mean?

28:22.534 --> 28:25.404
"Mean mean."
(snorts)

28:25.537 --> 28:27.573
JACK:
Kate, look at me.

28:27.706 --> 28:30.576
Who locked Joanie
in the bathroom?

28:30.709 --> 28:33.512
She yelled at Kevin
for not sleeping.

28:33.645 --> 28:35.414
So Kevin locked her
in the bathroom?

28:35.547 --> 28:37.049
No.

28:38.450 --> 28:41.988
You locked her
in the bathroom, Randall?

28:42.121 --> 28:43.022
REBECCA (whispers):
Randall,

28:43.155 --> 28:44.924
you can tell me.

28:45.057 --> 28:46.325
-Rebecca, please.
-What?

28:46.458 --> 28:49.161
Randall and I talk.
We have a thing.

28:49.295 --> 28:51.597
I did it, okay?
Joanie's not nice.

28:51.730 --> 28:54.033
She calls Kate "Chatty Cathy."

28:54.166 --> 28:55.167
KATE:
Yeah.

28:55.301 --> 28:56.468
Every time I talk.

28:56.602 --> 28:58.337
It hurts her feelings.

28:58.470 --> 29:01.808
The chair under the doorknob
was my idea.

29:03.475 --> 29:05.677
Well, guys, you can't...

29:05.812 --> 29:08.047
you can't lock someone
in a bathroom

29:08.180 --> 29:09.348
just because they hurt
Kate's feelings.

29:09.481 --> 29:11.784
-You understand?
-Why not?

29:11.918 --> 29:13.352
She's our sister.

29:15.187 --> 29:17.623
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

29:17.756 --> 29:19.625
-Hey, how is he?
-Is he all right?

29:19.758 --> 29:23.029
Um, he has a nasty gash
on his forehead.

29:23.162 --> 29:24.530
He's in getting stitches
right now,

29:24.663 --> 29:25.998
but he's gonna be all right.

29:27.033 --> 29:28.434
Here.

29:29.936 --> 29:31.303
(exhales)

29:31.437 --> 29:33.405
Now can you help me
fill out this paperwork,

29:33.539 --> 29:36.208
because I can't seem to remember
any of his information.

29:36.342 --> 29:38.010
Yeah, okay, yeah.

29:38.144 --> 29:39.946
-We got it.
-Thank you.

29:44.817 --> 29:47.319
KATE:
Wait, Jack, we have to put
your hands down, bud.

29:47.453 --> 29:49.555
-(Jack screams, crying)
-I know. I know.

29:49.688 --> 29:51.357
It's okay.

29:51.490 --> 29:52.524
Almost done.

29:55.727 --> 29:56.996
It's okay.

29:58.497 --> 29:59.866
Oh, wait.

29:59.999 --> 30:01.067
Be very careful with scissors...

30:03.970 --> 30:06.372
-You're very brave.
-TOBY: It's okay, buddy,
you're okay.

30:06.505 --> 30:09.208
Almost done, almost done.

30:36.168 --> 30:37.736
(footsteps approaching)

30:45.677 --> 30:47.446
He's okay.

30:57.523 --> 30:59.725
(exhales)

30:59.858 --> 31:01.894
(sniffles)

31:06.632 --> 31:08.700
(sighs)

31:09.902 --> 31:11.703
(indistinct chatter)

31:18.577 --> 31:20.212
(sighs)

31:22.314 --> 31:25.151
I thought that the gate
was locked.

31:27.819 --> 31:29.421
Not here.

31:31.823 --> 31:33.625
(door opens)

31:37.763 --> 31:39.498
(door closes)

31:41.400 --> 31:44.336
I told you. I told you
to listen for the click.

31:44.470 --> 31:47.139
Yes, I know, I know.

31:47.273 --> 31:49.175
Maybe I would've heard the click

31:49.308 --> 31:51.143
if you weren't yelling
at me all the time.

31:51.277 --> 31:53.112
Oh, God-- Toby, come on.

31:53.245 --> 31:55.681
Look, I thought he was safe.

31:55.814 --> 31:57.950
He was there one minute,
and he was gone the next.

31:58.084 --> 32:00.352
But it wasn't just
one minute, Toby.

32:00.486 --> 32:02.154
It-it wasn't. It was,
it was many, many minutes

32:02.288 --> 32:04.390
between Jack leaving his room
and you even bothering

32:04.523 --> 32:06.358
to notice that he was gone.

32:06.492 --> 32:08.660
Gone out the door
you left unlocked, by the way.

32:08.794 --> 32:10.496
The door you taught him
how to open.

32:10.629 --> 32:13.165
Who does that with a,
with a sighted toddler,

32:13.299 --> 32:14.633
let alone a blind child?

32:14.766 --> 32:16.668
And then this park song
that you do with him?

32:16.802 --> 32:18.637
-Okay-- Dignity...
-Oh...

32:18.770 --> 32:20.639
...independence, confidence,
self-respect.

32:20.772 --> 32:23.742
That's what we need to be
instilling in him now, Toby.

32:23.875 --> 32:25.978
Now. Not when he's 12
or 18 or 32.

32:26.112 --> 32:27.546
So he can get it in his soul,

32:27.679 --> 32:30.849
in his cells, so he knows
that he's not broken.

32:30.983 --> 32:33.885
All you've ever seen
were his limitations.

32:34.020 --> 32:37.556
-(car doors open)
-Okay, okay. You-you need sleep.

32:37.689 --> 32:39.491
KATE:
From the moment
that we brought him home,

32:39.625 --> 32:41.727
all you did was google
eye surgeries that didn't work

32:41.860 --> 32:44.430
instead of holding him.

32:44.563 --> 32:46.932
So you want to blame it on me
not moving to San Francisco?

32:47.066 --> 32:48.767
Fine, but you know what?

32:48.900 --> 32:52.404
The truth is, you pulled away
from us way back then.

32:52.538 --> 32:54.240
You are losing your mind
right now.

32:54.373 --> 32:57.709
Oh, are you gonna go-- Oh, oh,
you're pulling away, Toby! Bye!

32:57.843 --> 32:59.745
-You all right, Kate?
-All I see are his limitations?

32:59.878 --> 33:01.347
You don't see any.

33:01.480 --> 33:02.748
All right? And that's
just irresponsible.

33:02.881 --> 33:04.883
You know what burns me up?

33:05.017 --> 33:07.386
The fact that you think
because you sing with a bunch

33:07.519 --> 33:09.221
of blind kids that that
makes you the only parent

33:09.355 --> 33:10.889
in this family
that can raise one.

33:11.023 --> 33:14.260
I am the only parent
in this family, Toby, period.

33:14.393 --> 33:17.396
That's the way you want it!
That's the way you've made it!

33:17.529 --> 33:18.697
Guys, take it easy, yeah?

33:18.830 --> 33:20.266
(sighs)

33:20.399 --> 33:23.202
Do you even want me
to move back to L.A.?

33:23.335 --> 33:24.436
What?

33:24.570 --> 33:26.938
-Do you?
-Um-- Oh, I'm sorry,

33:27.073 --> 33:28.874
do you not feel wanted
right now, Toby?

33:29.007 --> 33:32.311
I feel judged and blamed
every day.

33:32.444 --> 33:34.313
That's how I feel.
Judged and blamed.

33:34.446 --> 33:35.781
Let's get your finger
out of her face

33:35.914 --> 33:37.383
and watch how you talk to her.
How about that?

33:37.516 --> 33:39.918
What-what-what are you talk--
What are you doing here?

33:40.052 --> 33:42.321
-What are you doing everywhere
here? You're in my house.
-I'm here because--

33:42.454 --> 33:44.656
-You're in my marriage.
-Well, you're not here!
You're not here, are you? Huh?

33:44.790 --> 33:45.957
-RANDALL: You guys,
let's just stop.
-KEVIN: That's why I'm here.

33:46.092 --> 33:47.426
-'Cause you're not.
-RANDALL: Okay? Just...

33:47.559 --> 33:49.128
Stop.

33:55.267 --> 33:56.635
(exhales)

33:56.768 --> 33:58.437
Well, there it is.

34:00.639 --> 34:02.308
This is per-- it's perfect.

34:02.441 --> 34:04.243
Way it's always been.

34:06.878 --> 34:08.914
(dog barking in distance)

34:13.552 --> 34:15.121
(door opens, closes)

34:20.926 --> 34:22.728
(white noise playing)

34:26.898 --> 34:28.800
KEVIN (whispers):
Thank you.

34:28.934 --> 34:30.602
I had to see them.

34:30.736 --> 34:32.138
-Of course.
-After what happened with Jack.

34:32.271 --> 34:33.772
I know.

34:33.905 --> 34:36.475
Just... the thought of it...

34:37.509 --> 34:39.111
Yeah.

34:44.950 --> 34:46.985
* *

34:48.320 --> 34:50.822
Well, I-I should
get back to Kate's, so...

34:50.956 --> 34:52.591
Yeah.

34:53.825 --> 34:55.861
Um, have a good night.

34:59.798 --> 35:01.200
(door closes)

35:01.333 --> 35:02.801
(door opens)

35:02.934 --> 35:04.203
MADISON:
Hey.

35:06.372 --> 35:08.006
You okay?

35:08.140 --> 35:11.143
(exhales)
Yeah.

35:12.178 --> 35:13.945
It's-it's just, uh...

35:15.981 --> 35:17.549
I was, I was
at the hospital earlier,

35:17.683 --> 35:19.551
I was filling out all
of those forms, you know,

35:19.685 --> 35:22.020
the, uh, intake forms,

35:22.154 --> 35:24.823
and it dawned on me that...

35:24.956 --> 35:26.992
you're still
my emergency contact.

35:29.728 --> 35:32.030
I was thinking maybe I should
change it to Randall.

35:34.233 --> 35:37.936
(laughs softly) Randall
lives across the country.

35:38.069 --> 35:40.772
How would he help you
in an emergency?

35:40.906 --> 35:42.841
Yeah, but Randall is out here
an obnoxious amount of times.

35:42.974 --> 35:45.076
And-- Or maybe
I'll make it Kate, but...

35:46.245 --> 35:48.680
What I'm saying is you are...

35:51.850 --> 35:56.054
...officially released from
your emergency contact duties.

36:05.431 --> 36:07.299
Hey, Kev.

36:07.433 --> 36:09.034
Um...

36:11.237 --> 36:14.940
I think Elijah's
gonna propose to me.

36:15.073 --> 36:17.743
Oh.

36:17.876 --> 36:20.512
Oh. Well, that's, uh...

36:21.847 --> 36:24.483
Oof. How does it make you feel?

36:24.616 --> 36:28.186
Can you handle the truth
if I tell you?

36:31.357 --> 36:34.092
Yeah. Yeah.

36:36.795 --> 36:39.398
Very excited.

36:39.531 --> 36:42.268
(laughs):
I... I really love him, Kevin.

36:47.873 --> 36:50.075
Well, then that makes me
very, very happy.

36:54.780 --> 36:57.182
(both chuckle)

36:57.316 --> 37:00.118
-Hey, Kev.
-Hmm?

37:00.252 --> 37:03.755
I am the mother
of your children.

37:03.889 --> 37:05.524
I will be your emergency contact

37:05.657 --> 37:07.926
for as long
as you need me to be.

37:13.932 --> 37:15.801
(softly):
Okay.

37:15.934 --> 37:17.736
-Night.
-Good night.

37:20.272 --> 37:21.840
* *

37:24.310 --> 37:30.115
* I met two angels,
but they were in disguise *

37:30.248 --> 37:35.487
* Took one look to realize *

37:35.621 --> 37:39.491
* Tell them anything
and they will sympathize *

37:42.127 --> 37:46.865
* These arms hold me tight *

37:46.998 --> 37:52.237
* Old fears, helped to ease
them in my mind *

37:52.371 --> 37:56.475
* New tears say
that they will dry in time *

37:56.608 --> 37:58.644
* Why me? *

37:58.777 --> 38:02.881
* How'd I get this hallelujah? *

38:04.450 --> 38:08.954
* Hallelujah... *

38:10.556 --> 38:12.358
-So...
-So...

38:14.960 --> 38:17.195
Well, this party blew.

38:17.329 --> 38:19.531
(laughing):
It did.

38:19.665 --> 38:21.066
-Glad you came out for it?
-Oh, yeah.

38:21.199 --> 38:23.201
-Yeah?
-(both laugh)

38:23.335 --> 38:24.936
How'd it go with Madison?

38:25.070 --> 38:26.938
Uh, you know, it's--
uh, we eloped.

38:27.072 --> 38:29.508
-Good for you.
-Yeah, yeah, it was a...

38:29.641 --> 38:31.410
small little, uh, wedding--
drive-through,

38:31.543 --> 38:33.278
off of Sepulveda there,
it was nice, yeah.

38:33.412 --> 38:35.581
We had Carl's Jr.
afterwards, so...

38:35.714 --> 38:36.848
-Answer me this.
-Yeah?

38:36.982 --> 38:39.017
Why isn't it "Carl Jr.'s"?

38:40.752 --> 38:43.689
-L.A.'s stupid.
-Yes, it's so stupid.

38:44.756 --> 38:46.725
Hey, Katie girl.

38:46.858 --> 38:48.193
KEVIN:
How we doing?

38:50.396 --> 38:52.464
Never better.

38:52.598 --> 38:54.733
* *

38:54.866 --> 38:56.201
Come on.

39:03.509 --> 39:05.076
(sighs heavily)

39:08.547 --> 39:11.049
After they got done
stitching Jack up,

39:11.182 --> 39:15.053
the doctor asked him why he went
to the park, and he said,

39:15.186 --> 39:17.723
"Because that's where Mommy
and Daddy are happy."

39:17.856 --> 39:19.991
(shuddering breath)

39:20.125 --> 39:25.897
* I met two angels,
but they were in disguise *

39:26.031 --> 39:29.401
* Took one look to realize *

39:30.902 --> 39:35.874
* Tell them anything
and they will sympathize *

39:37.375 --> 39:41.580
* These arms hold me tight *

39:42.814 --> 39:47.252
* Old fears, helped
to ease them in my mind *

39:47.385 --> 39:49.287
* New tears say *

39:49.421 --> 39:52.157
* That they will dry in time *

39:52.290 --> 39:53.625
* Why me? *

39:53.759 --> 39:58.396
* How'd I get this hallelujah? *

39:59.931 --> 40:03.134
* Hallelujah *

40:05.971 --> 40:10.842
* Laughing together like
our thoughts are harmonized *

40:12.243 --> 40:17.315
* Been that way since '95 *

40:17.449 --> 40:22.120
* Give me direction
when it is hard to fight *

40:23.955 --> 40:28.727
* Three roads, one light *

40:28.860 --> 40:33.231
* Now and then I can
lean my back to yours *

40:34.533 --> 40:38.870
* Traveling like our feet
don't touch the floor *

40:39.004 --> 40:40.506
* Why me? *

40:40.639 --> 40:44.776
* How'd I get this hallelujah? *

40:46.645 --> 40:50.148
* Hallelujah *

40:51.483 --> 40:53.351
* Hallelujah... *

40:53.485 --> 40:55.921
I loved this anniversary.

40:56.054 --> 40:58.524
-(scoffs, laughs)
-What? I mean it.

40:58.657 --> 41:01.860
-You're obviously still drunk.
-Mm-mm.

41:01.993 --> 41:04.362
Think about it, babe.

41:04.496 --> 41:06.665
Our first time leaving them
home for a whole night...

41:06.798 --> 41:09.267
-Half a night.
-And what did they do?

41:09.400 --> 41:13.004
-They ruined it.
-No. They banded together.

41:13.138 --> 41:16.508
They looked out for one another.

41:16.642 --> 41:18.877
This is a seminal moment, Jack.

41:19.010 --> 41:22.814
I know you may not see it
right now, but trust me.

41:24.516 --> 41:28.253
Kevin protecting Kate
and Randall then jumping in

41:28.386 --> 41:31.690
to protect Kevin protecting Kate
and Kate defending both of them.

41:33.324 --> 41:36.327
I-I couldn't ask
for a better gift.

41:37.563 --> 41:38.864
I could.

41:38.997 --> 41:40.899
I could definitely ask
for a better gift.

41:41.032 --> 41:44.369
-(laughs)
-(chuckles)

41:44.502 --> 41:46.572
-How about, next anniversary...
-Mm. Mm-hmm?

41:46.705 --> 41:48.807
...I get you...

41:48.940 --> 41:50.542
(indistinct whisper)

41:50.676 --> 41:53.545
Oh, that-- Can I get that
for Christmas?

41:53.679 --> 41:56.047
-Mm.
-You know, Christmas
is a lot sooner.

41:56.181 --> 41:58.416
-Yeah, we'll see.
-Okay.

41:58.550 --> 41:59.985
(laughs)

42:00.118 --> 42:03.622
* How'd I get this hallelujah? *

42:06.457 --> 42:08.326
* Hallelujah. *

42:08.459 --> 42:10.796
I don't know if Toby and I
are gonna make it.

42:16.234 --> 42:17.903
(sniffles)
