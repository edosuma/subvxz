00:01.767 --> 00:04.600
Last time, on "Star Trek:
The Next Generation".

00:04.687 --> 00:08.566
Not all the Klingons at Khitomer
were killed during the massacre.

00:08.927 --> 00:11.361
Many were captured
by the Romulans

00:11.447 --> 00:15.042
and placed in a prison camp
on a remote planet.

00:15.127 --> 00:16.799
Your father was among them.

00:16.887 --> 00:21.085
If my father were alive, it would
dishonour his sons and their sons.

00:21.167 --> 00:23.886
Even Alexander would bear the burden.

00:23.967 --> 00:29.325
So, you're willing to ignore
the possibility because of dishonour?

00:29.407 --> 00:34.037
My father is dead.
That Yridian is selling lies.

00:34.127 --> 00:38.166
This is a homing device.
It will allow you to find my ship.

00:45.087 --> 00:48.079
You are Klingon.
Where did you come from?

00:48.167 --> 00:51.876
That does not matter.
I have come to take you home.

00:51.967 --> 00:53.002
He must leave.

00:53.087 --> 00:55.282
It's too late. He would bring others.

01:03.287 --> 01:07.678
We are not leaving here
and neither are you.

01:08.087 --> 01:09.998
And now, the conclusion.

01:11.807 --> 01:13.206
Take his pack.

01:16.607 --> 01:18.757
Are you afraid to die escaping?

01:18.847 --> 01:22.886
We are dead, Worf.
We died at Khitomer.

01:22.967 --> 01:26.164
We were captured.
It was worse than death.

01:26.247 --> 01:28.158
Why did you allow it?

01:28.247 --> 01:33.241
We had no choice. We were defending
an outpost on the perimeter.

01:33.327 --> 01:35.636
The Romulans took out our shields,

01:35.727 --> 01:38.082
the next blast
rendered us unconscious.

01:39.527 --> 01:44.647
When we awoke, we were prisoners,
unarmed and shackled.

01:44.727 --> 01:47.161
We were interrogated
for three months.

01:47.247 --> 01:50.284
We tried to starve ourselves
but they kept us alive.

01:50.367 --> 01:53.916
The Romulan Cmdr Tokath
thought he was being kind.

01:54.007 --> 01:57.761
The Romulans hoped to trade our lives
for territorial concessions.

01:57.847 --> 02:00.998
The Klingon High Council
refused to negotiate.

02:01.087 --> 02:04.921
They would not acknowledge that
warriors had been taken prisoner.

02:05.007 --> 02:10.479
When it was clear we were of
no use, Tokath offered to let us go.

02:10.567 --> 02:14.480
But we knew that our families
believed we had fallen in battle.

02:15.607 --> 02:18.280
We would not return
to dishonour them.

02:18.367 --> 02:21.677
We asked Tokath to let us stay.
He took pity on us.

02:23.167 --> 02:28.525
I understand your desire
to preserve your family's honour.

02:28.607 --> 02:32.964
But what of your own? There is
no honour in remaining prisoners.

02:34.207 --> 02:37.358
We lost our honour
when we were captured.

02:38.727 --> 02:41.082
It does not matter
what happens to us.

02:41.167 --> 02:44.955
All that matters is that
our families are not dishonoured.

02:45.647 --> 02:47.683
Why did you come here, Worf?

02:47.767 --> 02:49.803
If you had found your father, ...

02:51.047 --> 02:54.039
..you would have found
only dishonour.

02:56.407 --> 02:59.763
If he had been captured, as you were,

02:59.847 --> 03:04.602
if I had found him here,
I would be glad to see him.

03:05.727 --> 03:09.436
There is no room
in my heart for shame.

03:09.527 --> 03:13.156
I can only hope
that if my son came here, ...

03:14.407 --> 03:17.638
..he would be Klingon enough
to kill me.

03:45.807 --> 03:48.924
Space, the final frontier.

03:50.207 --> 03:53.836
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

03:54.407 --> 03:58.525
Its continuing mission,
to explore strange new worlds,...

03:59.607 --> 04:02.804
..to seek out new life
and new civilizations,...

04:03.887 --> 04:07.721
..to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

05:23.847 --> 05:27.317
- This is a gin'tak spear.
- What of it?

05:27.407 --> 05:30.319
Have your parents
taught you nothing?

05:30.407 --> 05:34.400
This is used for battle,
not tilling soil.

05:34.487 --> 05:37.957
We have no need for weapons.
The war is far away.

05:38.487 --> 05:39.715
What war?

05:39.887 --> 05:42.685
The war our parents
came here to escape.

05:44.007 --> 05:46.237
That war was over many years ago.

05:47.207 --> 05:52.361
I'm not interested in what you've got
to say. I've got work to do.

06:06.727 --> 06:08.922
Hello again, Worf.

06:10.727 --> 06:14.083
They say you've come to stay with us.

06:14.167 --> 06:15.566
Not by choice.

06:15.647 --> 06:19.083
Aren't you happy
to have escaped the war?

06:19.167 --> 06:20.566
The war...

06:20.647 --> 06:24.686
Yes. We've heard the stories
all our lives.

06:24.767 --> 06:27.600
How people are slaughtered
in terrible battles,

06:27.687 --> 06:30.406
forced to fight
whether they want to or not.

06:30.487 --> 06:34.116
That's why our parents came here,
to make a safe home,

06:34.207 --> 06:37.199
a place to raise
their children in peace.

06:37.887 --> 06:41.004
You should be relieved.
You're safe here.

06:41.087 --> 06:44.682
A place can be safe
and still be a prison.

06:44.767 --> 06:48.316
Where I come from,
people are free to come and go.

06:49.167 --> 06:50.486
So are we.

06:57.207 --> 07:00.643
Tell your father
that you would like to leave.

07:00.727 --> 07:05.198
Tell him that you want to visit the
Klingon Homeworld. See what he says.

07:05.287 --> 07:08.040
Why would I go there? It's dangerous.

07:08.127 --> 07:09.526
Not any longer.

07:10.087 --> 07:11.315
Ba'el.

07:11.887 --> 07:15.084
- Come here.
- Yes, Mother.

07:16.967 --> 07:19.527
You are not allowed to leave
the compound?

07:21.607 --> 07:24.041
Then I won't see you
at the pond again.

07:27.607 --> 07:31.316
- I told you not to speak with him.
- I'm sorry, Mother.

08:31.167 --> 08:32.566
Enter.

08:39.807 --> 08:41.320
I am Tokath.

08:42.967 --> 08:46.516
I can return later
if I'm disturbing you.

08:46.607 --> 08:48.165
It is a strange thing

08:48.247 --> 08:52.923
when the jailer concerns himself
with his prisoner's comfort.

08:53.007 --> 08:55.077
Mine is a strange prison.

08:58.327 --> 09:01.364
You robbed the Klingons
of who they were.

09:02.487 --> 09:03.840
You dishonoured them.

09:03.927 --> 09:06.999
By not slitting their throats
when we found them?

09:07.087 --> 09:11.524
I do not expect you to understand.
You are a Romulan.

09:14.447 --> 09:19.077
You're just like L'Kor was
20 years ago, proud and angry.

09:19.687 --> 09:22.645
He hated me. All the Klingons did.

09:22.727 --> 09:25.560
I had no love for them,
I won't deny it.

09:26.847 --> 09:28.803
When I informed the High Command

09:28.887 --> 09:31.606
that the Klingons
wanted to remain here,

09:31.687 --> 09:36.158
I was told that unless I stayed
to oversee them myself

09:36.247 --> 09:37.919
they would be killed.

09:39.607 --> 09:42.565
My decision ended
my military career.

09:43.727 --> 09:45.001
Why do it?

09:45.887 --> 09:49.880
I don't expect you to understand.
You're a Klingon.

09:51.047 --> 09:53.607
But I do expect you
to understand this.

09:54.407 --> 09:57.205
We've put aside the old hatreds.

09:57.287 --> 10:01.565
Here, Romulans and Klingons
live in peace.

10:02.847 --> 10:06.283
I won't allow you
to destroy what we have.

10:10.927 --> 10:13.600
Do not deceive yourself.

10:13.687 --> 10:16.599
These people are not happy here.

10:16.687 --> 10:19.281
I see the sadness in their eyes.

10:19.367 --> 10:22.598
That's not what I see
when I look in my wife's eyes.

10:24.127 --> 10:25.924
I married a Klingon.

10:26.767 --> 10:30.077
So, when I warn you
not to disrupt our lives,

10:30.167 --> 10:33.239
I'm not speaking just as a jailer,

10:33.327 --> 10:36.444
but as a man protecting his family.

10:38.407 --> 10:40.477
Do not test my tolerance.

11:38.087 --> 11:40.840
Do you know what that song means?

11:40.927 --> 11:43.999
No, I just like the melody.

11:58.127 --> 11:59.401
Stop.

12:28.367 --> 12:29.641
There.

12:57.967 --> 13:01.801
Captain's log, stardate 46759.2.

13:01.887 --> 13:05.197
The Yridian vessel Lt Worf
boarded at Deep Space Nine

13:05.287 --> 13:08.085
failed to arrive
for our scheduled rendezvous.

13:08.167 --> 13:09.964
It is now 12 hours overdue.

13:10.047 --> 13:13.198
Still no sign of them
on long-range scanners.

13:13.287 --> 13:16.962
Contact DS9. Find out what they know
about this Yridian trader.

13:17.047 --> 13:19.720
Hopefully, he filed a flight plan.

13:19.807 --> 13:22.196
It's our only chance of finding Worf.

13:26.367 --> 13:30.076
We haven't had to use one of these
for a long time.

13:31.447 --> 13:34.962
It implants a small boridium pellet
underneath the skin.

13:37.127 --> 13:40.005
We can use its energy signature
to track you.

13:41.287 --> 13:44.563
In time, you will grow accustomed
to life here.

13:46.967 --> 13:47.956
Never.

13:48.807 --> 13:53.323
He is one of yours.
Deal with him however you like.

13:53.407 --> 13:56.843
But I warn you,
if he becomes a disruption,

13:56.927 --> 13:59.122
I will not be so tolerant.

14:00.487 --> 14:01.761
Toq.

14:04.367 --> 14:06.437
You guard him.

14:06.847 --> 14:09.645
He is free to move around
inside the compound.

14:09.727 --> 14:12.958
But make certain
he does not cause trouble.

15:16.967 --> 15:20.403
- What are you doing?
- This is the Mok'bara.

15:23.007 --> 15:25.441
The form clears the mind...

15:27.127 --> 15:28.958
..and centres the body.

15:39.447 --> 15:41.199
No. Like this.

15:42.567 --> 15:44.603
First, learn how to breathe.

15:46.207 --> 15:48.641
Stand tall, as tall as you can.

15:48.727 --> 15:52.003
- Now, take a wider stance.
- You must stop.

15:55.687 --> 15:58.645
These forms are the basis
for Klingon combat.

15:59.767 --> 16:02.440
You would be wise to learn them.

16:07.487 --> 16:09.842
I will teach you. Join us.

16:10.447 --> 16:13.245
We will see
what L'Kor thinks of this.

16:17.567 --> 16:19.205
Mother?

16:22.967 --> 16:24.958
She's not here. Come in.

16:27.447 --> 16:30.086
This is what I wanted to show you.

16:31.327 --> 16:36.117
I don't know why, but
I'm not supposed to look at these.

16:37.167 --> 16:40.125
- They're Klingon, aren't they?
- Yes.

16:40.967 --> 16:44.482
I thought you might be able
to tell me about them.

16:46.287 --> 16:48.676
This is a warrior's armour.

16:51.047 --> 16:55.279
And this is a d'k tahg.

16:59.247 --> 17:02.080
It should not be allowed
to rust like this.

17:03.607 --> 17:05.244
Isn't it beautiful?

17:12.887 --> 17:14.718
That is a jinaq.

17:15.887 --> 17:18.765
It is given to a daughter
who has come of age,

17:18.847 --> 17:21.202
old enough to take a mate.

17:22.727 --> 17:24.285
Ba'el.

17:24.367 --> 17:26.926
- Mother.
- Put that away at once.

17:27.007 --> 17:29.680
Why is she forbidden
to know what these are?

17:29.767 --> 17:31.439
They are not needed here.

17:36.767 --> 17:37.756
Go!

17:55.807 --> 17:59.595
Kahless held his father's
lifeless body in his arms.

17:59.687 --> 18:02.645
He could not believe
what his brother had done.

18:03.287 --> 18:07.121
Then his brother threw
their father's sword into the sea,

18:07.207 --> 18:12.361
saying if he could not possess it,
neither would Kahless.

18:13.687 --> 18:16.963
That was the last time
the brothers would speak.

18:17.047 --> 18:18.605
What happened to the sword?

18:18.927 --> 18:22.806
Kahless looked into the sea
and wept.

18:23.807 --> 18:27.356
For the sword
was all he had left of his father.

18:27.447 --> 18:32.123
The ocean filled with his tears
and flooded over the shore.

18:32.207 --> 18:33.560
That is impossible.

18:36.127 --> 18:38.402
For you, perhaps.

18:39.007 --> 18:41.646
Not Kahless. He was a great warrior.

18:41.727 --> 18:43.763
You're making it up.

18:43.847 --> 18:46.998
No. These are our stories.

18:48.007 --> 18:50.157
They tell us who we are.

18:52.407 --> 18:56.958
It is late. It is time to sleep.

19:16.727 --> 19:18.399
Worf.

19:19.047 --> 19:21.038
You never answered my question.

19:22.127 --> 19:25.324
Did Kahless ever find
his father's sword?

19:27.407 --> 19:29.398
Yes. He found it.

19:29.487 --> 19:32.718
The stories that you tell,
are they true?

19:32.807 --> 19:35.719
I have studied them all of my life,

19:35.807 --> 19:39.163
and find new truths in them
every time.

19:39.247 --> 19:45.004
This Kahless,
did he ever take a mate?

19:46.607 --> 19:49.440
That is another story.

19:51.287 --> 19:52.686
Tell me.

20:10.607 --> 20:12.359
You are Romulan.

20:19.647 --> 20:23.560
Tokath is my father.
I thought you knew that.

20:23.647 --> 20:26.320
How could your mother mate
with a Romulan?

20:26.407 --> 20:29.285
- Why shouldn't she?
- It is an obscenity.

20:29.367 --> 20:31.278
They love each other.

20:31.367 --> 20:34.404
Romulans are treacherous. Deceitful.

20:37.007 --> 20:39.157
They are without honour.

20:39.767 --> 20:41.837
My father is a good man.

20:41.927 --> 20:46.239
He is kind and generous. There is
nothing dishonourable about him.

20:46.327 --> 20:49.080
He took part
in a cowardly attack at Khitomer.

20:49.167 --> 20:52.796
Thousands of Klingons were
massacred, many women and children.

20:52.887 --> 20:57.438
I don't know what you're talking
about. My father escaped the wars.

20:57.527 --> 21:00.883
- He would never kill anybody.
- Ask him.

21:00.967 --> 21:04.482
Ask your mother.
Tell them you want to know the truth.

21:21.567 --> 21:22.920
What is it?

21:23.007 --> 21:26.602
We've received the Yridian's flight
plan from Deep Space Nine.

21:26.687 --> 21:29.963
He's been to three systems
in the past week.

21:30.047 --> 21:32.038
Worf could be at any one of them.

21:32.127 --> 21:34.516
Are any of them near Romulan space?

21:35.327 --> 21:38.922
Two of them. The Nequencia
and the Carraya Systems.

21:39.007 --> 21:41.840
- Let's head for the closer one.
- Aye, sir.

21:50.727 --> 21:52.922
What do you want?

21:53.007 --> 21:55.965
I am sorry if I upset you.

22:06.007 --> 22:07.565
I was surprised.

22:07.647 --> 22:09.365
I became angry.

22:11.047 --> 22:14.881
But I do not blame you.
You cannot help being what you are.

22:14.967 --> 22:17.276
There is nothing wrong
with what I am.

22:17.367 --> 22:19.756
What I mean is, it is not your fault.

22:19.847 --> 22:22.600
What, being born?
I'm sorry that offends you.

22:22.687 --> 22:24.200
No.

22:25.447 --> 22:27.403
It is hard to explain.

22:28.207 --> 22:31.722
Klingons and Romulans have been
blood enemies for centuries.

22:31.807 --> 22:34.082
Not here. Here, we live in peace.

22:34.167 --> 22:36.158
But I don't live here.

22:37.447 --> 22:42.441
Worf, before you knew,
you were attracted to me.

22:42.527 --> 22:47.203
Can't you leave the hatred behind?
Can't you accept me as I am?

22:50.767 --> 22:52.246
I do not know.

23:10.567 --> 23:12.000
Come on, Toq!

23:21.447 --> 23:22.960
Who's next?

23:30.207 --> 23:32.357
OK? Try again.

23:50.807 --> 23:53.958
- Ka'la!
- That is not how you play this game.

23:54.527 --> 23:59.806
The qa'vak is not a game.
It hones the skills of the hunt.

23:59.887 --> 24:01.639
The hunt?

24:02.127 --> 24:04.118
We have replicators here.

24:04.607 --> 24:07.519
Klingons do not hunt
because they need food.

24:07.607 --> 24:10.485
The hunt reminds us
of where we come from.

24:11.407 --> 24:14.558
I know where I came from. Right here.

24:20.127 --> 24:24.120
It is a difficult skill to master.
Perhaps you are too young.

24:40.087 --> 24:41.805
Your arm is strong.

24:44.607 --> 24:46.723
But you need practice.

24:47.447 --> 24:50.757
Hold your other arm like this
and aim along it.

24:54.047 --> 24:55.116
Roll.

25:00.887 --> 25:02.400
You learn quickly.

25:03.767 --> 25:07.442
Perhaps it is time
to put your skills to the test.

25:07.527 --> 25:09.438
What do you mean?

25:09.927 --> 25:12.964
Come. I will take you on the hunt.

25:13.047 --> 25:15.641
You are not allowed
to leave the compound.

25:17.527 --> 25:19.085
They won't allow it.

25:21.407 --> 25:23.363
I think they will.

25:27.487 --> 25:29.045
Hunting?

25:30.087 --> 25:31.805
Have you lost your mind?

25:31.887 --> 25:34.560
The boy can come with me.

25:34.647 --> 25:38.765
I cannot sit in the compound.
I must practise my skills.

25:38.847 --> 25:42.840
We can't let you out.
You've already tried to escape once.

25:42.927 --> 25:47.796
I give you my word, as a warrior.
I will not try to escape.

25:47.887 --> 25:50.799
Leave us. We have work to do.

25:52.567 --> 25:53.602
Tokath.

25:56.727 --> 25:58.319
He gave his word.

25:58.407 --> 26:03.117
Are you seriously suggesting we open
the gates and let him wander free,

26:03.207 --> 26:06.279
with only a boy as his guard?

26:06.367 --> 26:09.120
23 years ago, I gave you my word.

26:11.087 --> 26:15.046
In all this time,
have I ever broken it?

26:17.567 --> 26:20.639
I told you he was yours to deal with.

26:21.647 --> 26:26.562
If you want to take this risk,
the responsibility is yours.

26:30.287 --> 26:33.404
You will go with him. Take a weapon.

26:33.487 --> 26:36.559
If he breaks his word
and tries to escape, ...

26:39.167 --> 26:40.520
..kill him.

26:53.727 --> 26:55.285
He is there.

26:57.087 --> 27:00.238
The wind has shifted. We must wait.

27:00.327 --> 27:04.605
- Why? We're so close.
- Never approach prey from upwind.

27:04.687 --> 27:06.803
The breeze will carry your scent.

27:10.607 --> 27:12.165
The wind is shifting again.

27:14.847 --> 27:16.485
I can't smell anything.

27:18.287 --> 27:20.676
- He is there.
- How can you...?

27:22.767 --> 27:23.882
Yes.

27:24.967 --> 27:27.242
I can smell it.

27:27.327 --> 27:31.798
Remember the scent. More than
anything else, it will guide you.

27:33.527 --> 27:35.802
It is strong.

27:35.887 --> 27:38.606
I cannot believe
I couldn't smell it before.

27:38.687 --> 27:41.247
Let it work its way into your blood.

27:41.967 --> 27:46.040
- I can feel my heart pounding.
- Yes.

27:47.367 --> 27:50.996
This is the moment
where life and death meet.

27:52.207 --> 27:54.118
This is what we are.

27:54.727 --> 27:56.524
Warriors.

27:56.607 --> 27:58.757
I was never taught that.

28:00.887 --> 28:03.640
There is much you were never taught.

28:29.367 --> 28:31.164
Aren't you hungry, L'Kor?

28:31.247 --> 28:34.922
Or are you upset because
your prisoner has not returned?

28:35.487 --> 28:38.001
I should not
have sent the boy with him.

28:38.087 --> 28:42.080
- If he has been hurt...
- Don't worry, my friend.

28:42.167 --> 28:46.763
He'll come back. After all, a warrior
keeps his word. Isn't that so?

28:46.847 --> 28:47.996
Father?

28:48.087 --> 28:52.205
If I wanted to visit Romulus
or the Klingon Homeworld,

28:52.287 --> 28:54.084
would I be allowed to go?

29:00.807 --> 29:02.525
What is that?

29:11.647 --> 29:15.242
Tonight, we eat well.

29:18.447 --> 29:20.085
Get that off my table.

29:22.167 --> 29:25.159
You do not kill an animal
unless you intend to eat it.

29:25.247 --> 29:27.044
Get rid of it.

29:27.127 --> 29:29.595
I intend to, Tokath.

29:31.047 --> 29:33.436
But not until it's cooked.

29:37.527 --> 29:40.121
Today, I learned the ritual hunt.

29:40.727 --> 29:42.957
But that is not all I learned.

29:43.047 --> 29:47.723
I discovered that warrior's blood
runs through my veins.

29:48.247 --> 29:53.640
I do not know how or why,
but we have forgotten ourselves.

29:54.127 --> 29:56.925
Our stories are not told.

29:57.007 --> 29:59.475
Our songs are not sung.

30:01.127 --> 30:05.678
Tonight, as we came home,
we sang a song of victory.

30:06.487 --> 30:09.160
A song known only to me as a lullaby.

30:09.767 --> 30:12.804
But it is a warrior's song.

30:16.327 --> 30:18.636
Fire streaks the heavens.

30:24.287 --> 30:26.482
Battle has begun.

31:02.127 --> 31:03.196
Ba'el.

31:14.727 --> 31:19.118
Well, Worf, you've had quite
an effect on the young people.

31:19.207 --> 31:22.563
I have done nothing more than
show them who they are.

31:22.647 --> 31:27.198
No. You have shown them
what you want them to be.

31:31.207 --> 31:33.038
Tell me this.

31:33.127 --> 31:36.483
Do you know of any place,
any time in history,

31:36.567 --> 31:40.037
when Klingons and Romulans
have lived together in peace?

31:43.407 --> 31:49.039
We have despised each other,
fought each other, for centuries.

31:49.127 --> 31:53.917
Except here, on this remote planet,

31:54.007 --> 31:58.205
Romulans and Klingons
live together in harmony.

32:01.687 --> 32:08.240
No government, no leader, has
ever done what I have done here.

32:08.327 --> 32:09.760
And what about Toq?

32:10.087 --> 32:11.839
I saw what happened to him

32:11.927 --> 32:14.839
when he caught
the scent of his prey on the wind.

32:14.927 --> 32:17.395
For the first time, he felt powerful.

32:17.487 --> 32:20.320
That is what he has been denied
living here.

32:20.407 --> 32:23.479
That is what you have
tried to take away from him.

32:23.567 --> 32:27.242
Now, you may be content
to sit here and wither to old age,

32:27.327 --> 32:31.878
but Toq and the others have tasted
what it is to feel truly alive.

32:31.967 --> 32:35.880
- They will not give that up now!
- Enough of this.

32:35.967 --> 32:39.403
We could talk all night
and not convince each other.

32:42.527 --> 32:44.757
I offer you a choice.

32:44.847 --> 32:47.441
Live with us as one of us.

32:49.647 --> 32:55.438
- Or?
- Or I will have you put to death.

32:56.847 --> 32:58.838
Then that is what
you will have to do.

33:00.887 --> 33:03.082
Worf, consider this carefully.

33:03.447 --> 33:06.644
That death will be honourable.

33:06.727 --> 33:11.721
The young people will see
what it is to die as a Klingon.

33:32.807 --> 33:34.206
Enter.

33:36.447 --> 33:37.800
Thank you.

33:39.967 --> 33:42.003
I will remove the tracking device.

33:42.087 --> 33:44.965
You can go over the wall
and hide in the jungle.

33:45.047 --> 33:48.164
- Why are you doing this?
- My father is wrong.

33:48.247 --> 33:51.603
No matter how I feel about you,
you don't deserve to die.

33:54.527 --> 33:56.518
I am not going to run away.

33:57.207 --> 33:59.562
- They will kill you.
- Yes.

33:59.647 --> 34:01.319
But they will not defeat me.

34:02.527 --> 34:04.563
I don't understand you.

34:04.647 --> 34:07.207
A Klingon does not run away
from battles.

34:07.287 --> 34:09.721
Is that the lesson
you want us to learn?

34:09.806 --> 34:13.719
You've taught us a great deal,
awakened something in us.

34:13.806 --> 34:17.083
But I don't understand
what we can learn from your death.

34:17.167 --> 34:20.762
Then you do not yet understand
what it is to be Klingon.

34:22.447 --> 34:23.880
Worf.

34:25.047 --> 34:27.958
In spite of everything
that's happened,

34:28.047 --> 34:31.755
I still sense that you care for me.

34:32.766 --> 34:34.598
Am I wrong?

34:36.647 --> 34:39.559
You talk so much
about being a warrior,

34:39.647 --> 34:41.478
about honour and death.

34:42.527 --> 34:44.995
Is it so hard to speak of love?

34:45.087 --> 34:46.565
Worf, please.

34:52.927 --> 34:57.443
I would not have thought
it possible to love a Romulan.

34:57.527 --> 34:59.085
But you do.

35:02.727 --> 35:04.126
Yes.

35:04.207 --> 35:08.246
If you've come that far,
can't you take it one more step?

35:08.327 --> 35:11.205
Can't you stay here with us? With me?

35:12.527 --> 35:16.725
If there were a way,
I would take you away with me.

35:20.447 --> 35:22.961
If there's anything
I have learned from you,

35:23.047 --> 35:28.121
from your reaction to me,
it's that I have no place out there.

35:29.207 --> 35:32.404
Other Klingons will not accept me
for what I am.

35:32.487 --> 35:37.038
And if I stay, these Klingons
will not accept me for what I am.

35:37.127 --> 35:39.083
Why did you come here?

35:39.687 --> 35:43.362
We were so happy. We didn't know
there was anything missing.

35:43.487 --> 35:44.476
Ba'el.

35:57.927 --> 35:59.599
Goodbye, Worf.

36:36.167 --> 36:38.442
I know that there are those among you

36:38.927 --> 36:41.760
who may question
what I am about to do.

36:42.447 --> 36:45.245
You would not be wrong to do so.

36:45.727 --> 36:49.515
I have questioned myself, spent
the night considering my decision,

36:49.607 --> 36:53.566
challenging myself to justify
whether it is right.

36:53.647 --> 36:58.721
And I have reached the conclusion
that it is absolutely necessary

36:58.807 --> 37:01.162
to put this man to death.

37:01.927 --> 37:06.205
What we have built together
would be destroyed by this man.

37:06.287 --> 37:09.006
I cannot allow that to happen.

37:13.247 --> 37:16.876
I give you one last chance
to accept our way of life.

37:17.447 --> 37:20.439
Those are eloquent words, Tokath.

37:21.047 --> 37:24.198
But the truth is, I am being executed

37:24.287 --> 37:29.042
because I brought something
dangerous to your young people.

37:29.127 --> 37:30.480
Knowledge.

37:31.647 --> 37:33.319
Knowledge of their origins.

37:33.407 --> 37:36.205
Knowledge of the real reasons
you are in this camp.

37:36.287 --> 37:39.279
- The truth is a threat to you.
- Enough!

37:41.367 --> 37:43.085
Stand ready.

37:47.567 --> 37:49.444
Raise your weapons.

37:51.127 --> 37:52.845
- Father!
- Stop this.

38:00.927 --> 38:04.636
If you kill him,
you will have to kill me.

38:11.767 --> 38:13.200
Step aside, Toq.

38:13.287 --> 38:16.836
Worf would rather die
than accept this way of life.

38:16.927 --> 38:18.679
And so would I.

38:18.767 --> 38:22.237
I want to leave, as do many of us.

38:23.487 --> 38:26.399
You have to kill us to keep us here.

38:28.287 --> 38:30.164
You see, Tokath?

38:31.127 --> 38:32.879
It is already too late.

38:32.967 --> 38:37.165
I am warning you. Move aside, now.

38:39.447 --> 38:40.766
Stand ready.

38:42.127 --> 38:45.005
Toq, move away.

38:46.767 --> 38:47.802
Take aim.

39:26.447 --> 39:29.120
- Ba'el.
- Tokath.

39:35.367 --> 39:39.565
Long ago, when your captives
asked to stay here, ...

39:41.047 --> 39:46.519
..our hope was to avoid dishonouring
our children on the Homeworld.

39:46.607 --> 39:48.916
But perhaps, over the years,

39:49.007 --> 39:53.125
we lost sight of our children
that we raised here.

39:53.647 --> 39:58.596
This is our prison.
It should not be theirs.

40:21.887 --> 40:26.358
Years ago, your parents made
a great sacrifice for their families.

40:26.447 --> 40:29.598
Today, they do so again.

40:29.687 --> 40:32.121
For that, we must honour them.

40:33.647 --> 40:38.402
You must promise them
never to reveal their secret.

40:40.527 --> 40:43.200
No one must know of this place.

40:46.967 --> 40:51.006
A supply ship's due in a few days.
They will take us.

40:51.087 --> 40:53.999
When they arrive,
Tokath will explain it to them.

40:54.767 --> 40:57.122
Then we will start a new life.

41:03.567 --> 41:07.355
Captain's log, supplemental.
Our search for Worf was cut short

41:07.447 --> 41:11.759
when we received a message from him
to rendezvous with a Romulan vessel.

41:11.847 --> 41:14.964
He has informed us
we will be taking on passengers.

41:20.847 --> 41:22.599
It's good to see you.

41:26.287 --> 41:27.845
He seems fine.

41:27.927 --> 41:31.283
We're giving everyone
a check-up in sickbay.

41:35.127 --> 41:36.606
Thank you, Doctor.

41:37.327 --> 41:40.763
- Welcome home, Mr. Worf.
- Thank you, sir.

41:40.847 --> 41:44.760
Picard to bridge. Signal
that the last group is on board.

41:44.847 --> 41:45.962
Aye, sir.

41:46.847 --> 41:50.362
You found what you were looking for,
Mr. Worf?

41:50.447 --> 41:53.519
No, sir. There was no prison camp.

41:53.687 --> 41:55.803
Those young people are survivors

41:55.887 --> 41:58.242
of a vessel that crashed
four years ago.

41:59.687 --> 42:01.917
No one survived Khitomer.

42:04.807 --> 42:06.559
I understand.
