WEBVTT

00:01.436 --> 00:02.654
PREVIOUSLY ON "THE 100"...

00:02.698 --> 00:04.439
WHERE THE HELL
IS MY DAUGHTER?

00:04.482 --> 00:07.007
WE DIDN'T KNOW
SHE WAS MISSING
UNTIL TODAY.

00:07.050 --> 00:08.356
NOBODY DID.

00:08.399 --> 00:10.401
WE'RE GONNA GET
EVERYONE BACK.

00:10.445 --> 00:12.229
MADI: I REMEMBER THINGS.

00:12.273 --> 00:13.578
CLARKE:
YOUR SKETCHBOOK?

00:13.622 --> 00:16.973
MADI, DON'T TELL
ANYONE THAT...

00:17.017 --> 00:18.496
EVER.

00:18.540 --> 00:20.411
CLARKE: WE NEED TO GET
TO OUR FRIENDS.

00:25.764 --> 00:27.636
THERE'S YOUR BRIDGE. GO.

00:27.679 --> 00:29.072
YOU'RE COMING
WITH US.

00:29.116 --> 00:30.378
NOW MOVE.

00:30.421 --> 00:33.163
YOU SHOULD HAVE
MORE FAITH, CLARKE.

00:33.207 --> 00:35.078
MY THRONE.

00:35.122 --> 00:36.471
THE BOOK.

00:42.259 --> 00:44.827
CLARKE: BELLAMY...

00:44.870 --> 00:46.742
DON'T MAKE ME DO THIS.

00:46.785 --> 00:49.614
THE FATE OF THE ENTIRE
HUMAN RACE IS AT STAKE.

00:49.658 --> 00:51.529
I HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO SHARE THIS.

00:51.573 --> 00:52.965
I'M SORRY.

00:53.009 --> 00:54.576
ME, TOO.

00:54.619 --> 00:56.056
UNH!

01:21.777 --> 01:23.344
MADI: CLARKE!

01:25.520 --> 01:27.043
WHAT IS IT?
WHAT HAPPENED?

01:30.873 --> 01:32.135
CLARKE: WHERE ARE WE?

01:32.179 --> 01:34.094
THE SECOND DAWN
BUNKER.

01:34.137 --> 01:36.270
JACKSON: OTHERWISE KNOWN
AS HELL.

01:36.313 --> 01:37.836
EARTH?

01:39.969 --> 01:41.449
HOW?

01:41.492 --> 01:43.799
CADOGAN: THIS PLACE IS
PERFECT FOR YOU.

01:48.064 --> 01:49.848
NANO-TRACKING PROGRAM.

01:52.590 --> 01:55.506
WHAT IS IT YOU SAY?
MAY WE MEET AGAIN.

02:02.470 --> 02:04.167
GAIA: WELCOME HOME, MOTHER.

02:05.821 --> 02:07.214
GAIA?

02:22.011 --> 02:23.882
MADI: SEDA, HOW
ARE YOU HERE?

02:27.147 --> 02:29.018
GOOD QUESTION.

02:30.759 --> 02:32.891
HE TURNED OFF THE STONE.

02:32.935 --> 02:36.330
BEFORE THE BRIDGE CLOSED,
WE WENT THROUGH...

02:36.373 --> 02:37.679
UNH!

02:37.722 --> 02:39.724
LANDING HERE.

02:41.117 --> 02:44.816
GAIA: NO. HOW?

02:44.860 --> 02:46.296
THE CLOSING BRIDGE
DEFAULTS

02:46.340 --> 02:48.690
TO THE PLANETARY ORIGIN
OF OUR DNA.

02:48.733 --> 02:50.692
YOUR JOURNEY ENDS
HERE, TOO.

02:50.735 --> 02:52.650
GAIA, VOICE-OVER: HE WOULD NOT
STOP TALKING WHILE WE FOUGHT.

02:52.694 --> 02:54.478
HE SAID WHEN YOU'RE CAUGHT
IN A CLOSING BRIDGE,

02:54.522 --> 02:56.219
IT DEFAULTS
TO THE PLANETARY ORIGIN

02:56.263 --> 02:58.526
OF YOUR DNA, EARTH.

02:58.569 --> 02:59.875
FOR ALL MANKIND.

02:59.918 --> 03:01.181
I'M NO MAN.

03:01.224 --> 03:04.314
UNH! UNH! UGH!

03:04.358 --> 03:06.142
ARR!

03:11.321 --> 03:13.062
WHERE'S THE HEAD?

03:13.105 --> 03:15.195
GAIA: BURIED
WITH THE REST OF HIM.

03:15.238 --> 03:18.023
INDRA: UNTIL TODAY,
NO ONE EVEN KNEW
YOU WERE MISSING.

03:18.067 --> 03:20.243
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN ALONE HERE?

03:20.287 --> 03:23.507
A FEW DAYS UNTIL
THE OTHERS ARRIVED
THIS MORNING.

03:23.551 --> 03:25.944
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE
THE REST OF MY LIFE.

03:25.988 --> 03:27.468
WE'RE TOGETHER NOW.

03:30.645 --> 03:34.301
CLARKE: ECHO
AND OCTAVIA--
WHERE ARE THEY?

03:47.096 --> 03:49.359
MADI: IT'S SO GREEN.

03:52.101 --> 03:53.320
THEY'RE OVER HERE.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.846
MURPHY: EARTH
IS BACK.

04:07.464 --> 04:08.770
HEY.

04:08.813 --> 04:11.425
-JAX!
-HEY, BABY.

04:11.468 --> 04:13.514
OH, IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU.

04:13.557 --> 04:14.819
I MISSED YOU.

04:14.863 --> 04:16.908
RAVEN: HEY.
OCTAVIA: HI.

04:16.952 --> 04:19.955
MADI: HEY!
NIYLAH: HEY.

04:19.998 --> 04:22.000
MADI: IT'S GOOD
TO SEE YOU.

04:22.044 --> 04:23.872
HI.

04:23.915 --> 04:25.134
MADI: YOU WEREN'T INSIDE.

04:25.177 --> 04:26.744
-HEY.
-HEY.

04:28.790 --> 04:30.574
WHERE'S BELLAMY?

04:35.536 --> 04:37.320
CLARKE?

04:40.497 --> 04:41.759
DEAD.

04:44.675 --> 04:46.460
HE'S DEAD.

04:46.503 --> 04:47.939
BELLAMY?

04:47.983 --> 04:49.201
CLARKE, HE WAS FINE
WHEN WE LEFT.

04:49.245 --> 04:50.333
I'M A LITTLE CONFU--

04:50.377 --> 04:51.639
I KILLED HIM.

05:03.868 --> 05:06.393
I HAD TO.

05:06.436 --> 05:07.698
WHY?

05:10.527 --> 05:14.966
MADI'S SKETCHBOOK.
HE HAD IT,

05:15.010 --> 05:18.143
AND HE KNEW THAT
SHE STILL HAS
THE MEMORIES

05:18.187 --> 05:19.884
OF THE COMMANDER.

05:19.928 --> 05:23.105
SHE WOULD NEVER
BE SAFE.

05:23.148 --> 05:25.890
I BEGGED HIM TO
STOP.

05:25.934 --> 05:27.849
I TRIED TO GET
THE BOOK BACK,

05:27.892 --> 05:30.373
BUT HE...

05:30.417 --> 05:32.636
I TRIED EVERYTHING,
I PROMISE.

05:32.680 --> 05:34.246
I TRIED.

05:37.424 --> 05:39.339
I'M SO SORRY.

05:49.784 --> 05:51.133
I UNDERSTAND.

05:54.397 --> 05:56.094
SO WOULD THE OLD BELLAMY.

05:58.445 --> 06:01.970
THE ONE THAT WOULD DO
ANYTHING FOR HIS BABY SISTER

06:02.013 --> 06:04.233
AND THE PEOPLE HE LOVED.

06:13.329 --> 06:16.898
YOU CAN HATE ME
IF YOU WANT TO.

06:16.941 --> 06:18.943
GOD KNOWS I DO.

06:24.340 --> 06:27.343
WE LOST HIM
A LONG TIME AGO.

06:27.387 --> 06:31.042
HE NEEDED ALL THIS CHAOS
TO MAKE SENSE,

06:31.086 --> 06:33.001
ALL THE VIOLENCE,

06:33.044 --> 06:36.047
ALL THE PEOPLE
WE'VE KILLED.

06:36.091 --> 06:40.008
HE COULDN'T ACCEPT
THAT IT'S ALL MEANINGLESS.

06:40.051 --> 06:41.966
CADOGAN GAVE HIM MEANING,

06:42.010 --> 06:44.665
AND THAT MEANING IS
WHAT KILLED HIM...

06:46.667 --> 06:48.233
NOT YOU.

07:42.549 --> 07:44.507
GAIA: NO ONE WANTS
TO LIVE HERE,

07:44.551 --> 07:46.944
BUT IT WILL DO
UNTIL WE BUILD OUR OWN SHELTER.

07:46.988 --> 07:48.642
THERE IS A RIVER CLOSE BY,

07:48.685 --> 07:51.732
SO THERE IS PLENTY
OF DRINKING WATER.

07:51.775 --> 07:54.517
JACKSON: WHAT ABOUT FOOD?
YOU CHECK THE HYDROFARM?

07:54.561 --> 07:56.301
GAIA: NOTHING.
THAT WHOLE LEVEL

07:56.345 --> 07:59.391
WAS DESTROYED
IN THE FIRE.

07:59.435 --> 08:01.263
MILLER: WHERE IS BLODREINA?

08:02.743 --> 08:04.396
SHE DIDN'T COME
BACK INSIDE.

08:04.440 --> 08:06.224
INDRA: AVOIDING
HER DEMONS.

08:06.268 --> 08:07.922
I DON'T BLAME HER.

08:07.965 --> 08:09.619
GABRIEL: HAVE YOU FOUND
ANOTHER FOOD SOURCE?

08:09.663 --> 08:11.534
WE HEAR BIRDS, INSECTS,
SO THERE MUST--

08:11.578 --> 08:14.972
RAVEN: WHAT ABOUT POWER,
HOT WATER?

08:15.016 --> 08:16.670
THAT'S IT.
I'M OUT OF HERE.

08:16.713 --> 08:18.628
WHERE'S THE FUNKY BALL
WITH THE GREEN LIGHT?

08:18.672 --> 08:20.282
JORDAN: A WAY OUT
IS THE FIRST THING
WE LOOKED FOR.

08:20.325 --> 08:22.197
THERE'S NO STONE HERE.

08:22.240 --> 08:23.720
GABRIEL:
NO. THERE HAS TO BE.

08:23.764 --> 08:25.592
THAT'S HOW CADOGAN GOT
HIS PEOPLE OUT.

08:25.635 --> 08:27.594
NIYLAH: WE LIVED HERE
FOR 6 YEARS.

08:27.637 --> 08:29.117
I THINK WE WOULD
HAVE SEEN IT.

08:29.160 --> 08:30.510
RAVEN: ONE WAY
TO FIND OUT.

08:32.990 --> 08:34.905
JORDAN: RAVEN,
WE TRIED THAT.

08:34.949 --> 08:37.038
OUR HELMETS SHOWED
NO TRACE OF THE STONE
ANYWHERE.

08:39.693 --> 08:42.347
100 FEET
STRAIGHT DOWN.

08:42.391 --> 08:44.698
THEY GAVE YOU TRASH HELMETS
SO YOU COULDN'T GET OUT.

08:44.741 --> 08:46.351
MURPHY: PERFECT.
SO WE JUMP TO SANCTUM,

08:46.395 --> 08:48.963
HAVE A HOT SHOWER,
STOCK UP ON SUPPLIES.

08:49.006 --> 08:51.574
BRING MY PEOPLE
HOME.

08:51.618 --> 08:54.403
-RAVEN, CAN I?
-YEAH.

09:02.629 --> 09:04.065
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

09:04.108 --> 09:06.546
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
OUT OF HERE!

09:06.589 --> 09:09.200
EARTH IS OUR HOME.

09:09.244 --> 09:11.942
EVERYONE WHO IS FROM HERE
IS HERE...

09:13.204 --> 09:15.903
EVERYONE WE CARE ABOUT,

09:15.946 --> 09:18.558
AND I WILL NOT LOSE
ANYONE ELSE.

09:21.909 --> 09:23.475
LET'S CHOOSE A ROOM.

09:51.068 --> 09:53.593
PRETTY PICTURES,
DON'T YOU THINK?

09:56.204 --> 09:58.423
THESE RESTRAINTS
WON'T DO AT ALL.

10:00.904 --> 10:02.514
YOU'RE LUCKY MY PEOPLE
BROUGHT YOU HERE,

10:02.558 --> 10:05.126
OR YOU'D BE DEAD
RIGHT NOW.

10:05.169 --> 10:06.780
I FEEL LUCKY.

10:10.740 --> 10:12.916
DID YOU DRAW THIS?

10:12.960 --> 10:16.616
NO...BUT I KNOW
WHO DID.

10:19.401 --> 10:22.578
OHH. INCREDIBLE.

10:22.622 --> 10:25.059
YES. OUR MEDICINE
IS INCREDIBLE.

10:25.102 --> 10:27.714
SO IS OUR ABILITY
TO DIG THROUGH
YOUR MEMORIES,

10:27.757 --> 10:29.411
BUT I'D RATHER
SAVE THE TIME.

10:29.454 --> 10:31.065
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

10:31.108 --> 10:33.937
FIRST, I'LL NEED
ASSURANCES.

10:33.981 --> 10:35.939
SANCTUM IS MINE.

10:35.983 --> 10:37.854
WE DESTROY THE STONE.

10:37.898 --> 10:39.987
YOU PEOPLE NEVER
COME BACK.

10:41.989 --> 10:43.773
THE STONES ARE
INDESTRUCTIBLE,

10:43.817 --> 10:46.646
BUT, YES, YOU CAN
HAVE SANCTUM,

10:46.689 --> 10:49.692
NOT THAT IT'LL MATTER.

10:49.736 --> 10:53.478
I DON'T THINK YOU
COMPREHEND WHAT
THIS MEANS.

10:53.522 --> 10:56.568
IT MEANS SOMEONE HAS
MEMORIES THAT ARE
NOT THEIR OWN,

10:56.612 --> 10:59.354
MEMORIES THAT YOU REQUIRE
IN ORDER TO START A WAR

10:59.397 --> 11:02.444
WITH WHOEVER MADE
THE STONES,

11:02.487 --> 11:05.316
A WAR I WANT
NO PART OF.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.841
ONE PLANET WILL BE FINE,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

11:07.884 --> 11:10.408
NOT A WAR,
THE LAST WAR,

11:10.452 --> 11:13.934
AND YOU'LL BE PART
OF IT WHETHER YOU
LIKE IT OR NOT.

11:13.977 --> 11:15.544
HOW'S THAT?

11:15.587 --> 11:17.938
IF WE WIN,
WE TRANSCEND,

11:17.981 --> 11:20.549
EVOLVING BEYOND
THESE MEAT SACKS

11:20.592 --> 11:22.682
THAT AGE AND DIE,
BECOMING ONE

11:22.725 --> 11:25.554
WITH A UNIVERSAL
CONSCIOUSNESS.

11:25.597 --> 11:28.775
I LIKE THIS MEAT SACK.
IT'S NEW.

11:28.818 --> 11:30.602
-THIS WILL BE BETTER.
-HMM.

11:30.646 --> 11:34.084
AND WHETHER YOU
FIGHT WITH US OR NOT,

11:34.128 --> 11:36.913
EVEN YOU
WILL TRANSCEND.

11:36.957 --> 11:39.220
EVERY MEMBER
OF THE HUMAN
FAMILY WILL.

11:39.263 --> 11:42.223
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

11:42.266 --> 11:44.747
DO WE HAVE A DEAL
OR NOT?

11:44.791 --> 11:47.141
YOU FOOL.

11:47.184 --> 11:49.447
IF WE LOSE, IT WON'T
MATTER WHAT PLANET
YOU'RE ON

11:49.491 --> 11:51.449
OR WHETHER YOU'RE
FIGHTING.

11:51.493 --> 11:54.191
EVERY MEMBER
OF THE HUMAN
FAMILY DIES.

11:58.413 --> 12:00.328
CLARKE'S CHILD.

12:04.071 --> 12:05.289
MADI.

12:05.333 --> 12:07.074
OF COURSE.
BELLAMY KNEW.

12:07.117 --> 12:08.510
THAT'S WHY SHE
KILLED HIM.

12:08.553 --> 12:09.772
THANK YOU.

12:13.907 --> 12:16.736
SHEIDHEDA: SHE'LL NEVER
LET YOU TAKE HER CHILD.

12:16.779 --> 12:18.520
I WON'T BE ASKING.

12:18.563 --> 12:21.436
OF COURSE NOT. YOU'LL SEND
A STRIKE TEAM NO DOUBT,

12:21.479 --> 12:23.090
THEY'LL FIGHT YOU,
THE CHILD, AS WELL.

12:23.133 --> 12:25.396
IF SHE GETS KILLED,
YOU'LL HAVE NOTHING.

12:29.096 --> 12:32.229
-YOU HAVE A BETTER IDEA?
-YES.

12:32.273 --> 12:33.578
SEND ME.

12:40.585 --> 12:42.196
-YOU?
-MMM.

12:42.239 --> 12:43.806
WHO WANTS
NO PART OF THIS.

12:43.850 --> 12:47.027
THAT WAS BEFORE I KNEW
WHAT WAS AT STAKE.

12:47.070 --> 12:51.074
ALTHOUGH TRANSCEND
OR DIE HAS A NICE
RING TO IT,

12:51.118 --> 12:54.861
IT REALLY ISN'T
MUCH OF A CHOICE, IS IT?

12:56.471 --> 12:59.909
I'VE BEEN
IN THE CHILD'S HEAD.

12:59.953 --> 13:02.782
I KNOW HER BETTER
THAT SHE KNOWS HERSELF.

13:04.871 --> 13:07.438
HOW WELL DOES YOUR
STRIKE TEAM KNOW HER?

13:07.482 --> 13:10.920
I'LL GET HER BACK,
BUT THEN OUR DEAL
STILL STANDS.

13:18.275 --> 13:19.973
TAKE HIM
TO THE BRIDGE.

13:31.985 --> 13:33.900
JACKSON: I DON'T WANT
TO TAKE INVENTORY.

13:35.336 --> 13:37.729
SO DON'T.

13:37.773 --> 13:39.209
WE TOOK EVERYTHING
WE COULD CARRY

13:39.253 --> 13:40.820
WHEN WE MARCHED
FOR THE VALLEY.

13:44.040 --> 13:46.521
DO YOUR REMEMBER
OUR FIRST NIGHT
IN OUR DESERT TENT?

13:50.917 --> 13:52.527
HEY. YOU OK?

13:52.570 --> 13:54.834
I TOLD BELLAMY
I'D FORGIVE HIM.

13:56.226 --> 13:57.749
NOW I CAN'T.

14:04.321 --> 14:05.845
TALK TO ME.

14:08.021 --> 14:10.850
HE FORGAVE ME FOR
EVERYTHING I DID HERE.

14:12.764 --> 14:15.158
I WONDER IF MY FATHER
WOULD DO THAT.

14:16.768 --> 14:20.337
I DON'T THINK HE WOULD.

14:20.381 --> 14:23.688
YOUR FATHER WANTED
YOU TO LIVE, NATE.

14:23.732 --> 14:27.562
THAT'S WHY HE GAVE UP
HIS SPOT IN THIS BUNKER,

14:27.605 --> 14:30.173
AND YOU HAVE.

14:30.217 --> 14:32.175
YOU ARE.

14:34.961 --> 14:37.789
CLARKE'S RIGHT.

14:37.833 --> 14:41.532
EVERYONE WE CARE
ABOUT THAT'S LEFT
IS HERE.

14:44.013 --> 14:46.755
WE THOUGHT SANCTUM
WAS OUR SECOND CHANCE...

14:48.017 --> 14:50.019
BUT I THINK THIS IS.

14:56.417 --> 14:58.593
NIYLAH: WELCOME TO
NIYLAH'S REC ROOM.

14:58.636 --> 15:02.031
NO CURSING, NO SPITTING,
NO KILLING.

15:04.120 --> 15:08.081
GABRIEL: HUH. NO WAY.
A PIANO.

15:08.124 --> 15:10.126
I USED TO TICKLE
THE IVORIES.

15:10.170 --> 15:11.519
JORDAN, HOLD THIS.

15:11.562 --> 15:13.086
IT'S BEEN OVER
200 YEARS, BUT, UH...

15:14.652 --> 15:16.480
OUT OF TUNE.

15:16.524 --> 15:18.830
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:18.874 --> 15:22.747
OHH. THERE WERE
TOO MANY RULES
WHEN WE LIVED HERE.

15:22.791 --> 15:25.837
I FOUND MY WAY
AROUND MOST OF THEM.

15:31.800 --> 15:34.934
-THE BAR'S OPEN.
-AHH. IS IT SAFE?

15:34.977 --> 15:36.892
IT WAS NEVER SAFE.

15:41.941 --> 15:44.552
GOD, THAT'S AWFUL.

15:44.595 --> 15:47.598
IT WAS YOUR DAD'S RECIPE.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.396
SMOOTH.

16:06.182 --> 16:08.184
NIYLAH: ECHO.

16:19.891 --> 16:21.415
I'M TIRED.

16:23.286 --> 16:26.811
-I'LL GO WITH YOU.
-NO.

16:26.855 --> 16:27.987
I'M GONNA.

16:28.030 --> 16:29.336
NIYLAH: SHE NEEDS SPACE.

16:29.379 --> 16:31.860
JORDAN: AND WE NEED
TO DRINK.

16:33.557 --> 16:37.039
HOPE: OH. NO, NO,
THANK YOU.

16:37.083 --> 16:39.433
I'M TIRED, TOO.

16:39.476 --> 16:41.217
MY DAD MADE IT.

16:46.266 --> 16:49.486
OK. HMM.

16:51.053 --> 16:52.663
-OH, MY--
-HA HA HA!

16:54.970 --> 16:57.755
-IT'S GOOD, RIGHT?
-NO. THAT'S AWFUL. MMM.

16:57.799 --> 16:59.714
OH, MAN.

17:02.630 --> 17:05.459
THIS'LL DO UNTIL WE CAN
REBUILD ABOVE GROUND.

17:07.330 --> 17:11.595
PICK A BED. YOU'LL BE
LESS MAD AT ME IN THE MORNING.

17:15.164 --> 17:17.297
ALL THESE BEDS SHOULD BE
FILLED WITH PEOPLE.

17:17.340 --> 17:21.257
OH, MADI,
I'M REALLY NOT
IN THE MOOD TO ARGUE.

17:28.873 --> 17:32.660
YOU DECIDED FOR ME...AGAIN.

17:35.184 --> 17:38.013
I DECIDED
FOR EVERYONE.

17:38.057 --> 17:41.016
THAT'S WHAT I DO.

17:41.060 --> 17:44.237
JUST LIKE YOU DECIDED
TO KILL BELLAMY.

17:46.978 --> 17:48.893
I DID THAT
TO SAVE YOU.

17:48.937 --> 17:50.939
I DIDN'T ASK YOU TO,

17:50.982 --> 17:52.941
AND NOW YOU HAVE TO LIVE
WITH THAT!

17:52.984 --> 17:54.682
I DON'T WANT THAT
FOR YOU!

17:56.292 --> 17:59.730
I KNOW YOU'RE MAD THAT
I STRANDED US HERE,

17:59.774 --> 18:02.994
BUT REMEMBER
SHALLOW VALLEY,

18:03.038 --> 18:05.910
WHEN IT WAS JUST US
AND ALL WE WANTED WAS
FOR OUR FRIENDS--

18:05.954 --> 18:09.436
YOUR FRIENDS.
WHAT ABOUT MINE?

18:09.479 --> 18:11.090
I WAS STARTING TO BUILD
MY OWN LIFE.

18:11.133 --> 18:13.048
I HAVE FRIENDS
IN SANCTUM.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.703
PICASSO IS THERE, LUCA.

18:15.746 --> 18:17.705
YOU THINK YOU'RE
PROTECTING ME,

18:17.748 --> 18:20.142
BUT YOU'RE NOT.

18:20.186 --> 18:22.101
YOU RUINED MY LIFE.

18:23.624 --> 18:25.234
JUST LIKE YOU
RUINED YOUR OWN.

18:27.715 --> 18:30.239
MADI, WAIT.

18:30.283 --> 18:33.155
THIS PLACE IS HUGE.
YOU CAN'T JUST WANDER
OFF IN THE DARK.

18:36.115 --> 18:39.770
I WON'T. DON'T FOLLOW ME.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.347
MURPHY: OH, LET
THERE BE LIGHT.

18:52.696 --> 18:55.090
EMORI: THAT'S MY GIRL. HA.

18:59.573 --> 19:01.183
WELL, THANKS
FOR YOUR HELP.

19:01.227 --> 19:02.967
NOW WE FIND
THE STONE,

19:03.011 --> 19:04.230
ASSUMING YOU CAN
FIX THIS.

19:04.273 --> 19:05.666
YOU'RE KIDDING, RIGHT?

19:05.709 --> 19:07.102
I'M NOT A MIRACLE
WORKER, MURPHY.

19:07.146 --> 19:08.625
I BEG TO DIFFER.

19:08.669 --> 19:10.192
COME ONE. YOU KNOW
WE CAN'T LEAVE

19:10.236 --> 19:11.628
ALL THOSE PEOPLE
ON SANCTUM NOW
THAT WE KNOW

19:11.672 --> 19:13.413
IT'S SURVIVABLE HERE.

19:13.456 --> 19:15.545
THE PEOPLE ON SANCTUM ARE
BETTER OFF WITHOUT US.

19:15.589 --> 19:17.547
UNTIL THE NEXT
ECLIPSE MAYBE.

19:17.591 --> 19:19.201
CLARKE IS WRONG.

19:19.245 --> 19:20.985
SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE
ARE FROM HERE, RAVEN,

19:21.029 --> 19:22.639
WONKRU,
ELIGIUS PRISONERS.

19:22.683 --> 19:24.685
EARTH IS THEIR
HOME, TOO.

19:24.728 --> 19:27.340
LET ME ASK YOU
SOMETHING.

19:27.383 --> 19:29.080
WHEN YOU LET HATCH
AND HIS BUDDIES DIE,

19:29.124 --> 19:30.865
WAS THAT JUST TO
SAVE YOUR FRIENDS?

19:35.261 --> 19:38.220
WE PASSED A WORKSHOP
DOWN HERE.

19:38.264 --> 19:41.397
6 YEARS OF WATCHING
BELLAMY MANIPULATE
HER ON THE RING.

19:45.749 --> 19:48.230
DAMN IT.

19:48.274 --> 19:49.710
I KNOW.

19:53.496 --> 19:56.412
I MISS HIM, TOO.

19:56.456 --> 19:59.154
YEAH.

20:20.436 --> 20:22.351
INDRA: DID LINCOLN
TEACH YOU THAT?

20:27.574 --> 20:30.185
YOU WEREN'T
MY ONLY TEACHER.

20:30.229 --> 20:33.971
NO. JUST THE BEST.

20:37.192 --> 20:39.890
IT'S YOUR WATCH
IN THE ROTUNDA.

20:41.979 --> 20:45.722
NO WAY. I'M NOT
GOING BACK DOWN THERE.

20:45.766 --> 20:48.725
FINE.

20:48.769 --> 20:50.814
THEN NEITHER AM I.

20:52.947 --> 20:55.732
I TOLD YOU ONCE
WE MOURN THE DEAD

20:55.776 --> 20:58.300
WHEN THE WAR IS OVER.

20:58.344 --> 21:01.260
SO IS IT OVER?

21:01.303 --> 21:03.218
I HOPE SO.

21:05.829 --> 21:08.267
I SAW YOU DAYS AGO,
BUT FOR YOU,

21:08.310 --> 21:10.747
IT'S BEEN 10 YEARS
ON ANOTHER PLANET,

21:10.791 --> 21:12.662
YET STILL YOU HAVEN'T
MADE PEACE

21:12.706 --> 21:14.490
WITH WHAT HAPPENED HERE.

21:14.534 --> 21:15.883
I THOUGHT I DID.

21:17.406 --> 21:19.974
AND THEN SEEING
THE FIGHTING PIT AGAIN,

21:20.017 --> 21:22.716
I DON'T KNOW.

21:22.759 --> 21:26.285
WE DID WHAT WE HAD
TO DO TO SURVIVE,

21:26.328 --> 21:31.420
BUT IF IT IS YOUR PENANCE
TO SIT HERE

21:31.464 --> 21:33.074
IN THE FREEZING COLD,

21:33.117 --> 21:35.032
THEN IT IS MY PENANCE, TOO,

21:35.076 --> 21:37.252
BECAUSE I AM
EQUALLY GUILTY

21:37.296 --> 21:39.298
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
DOWN THERE.

21:40.603 --> 21:42.475
WE WERE ALL BLODREINA.

21:54.138 --> 21:57.577
NOW COME ON. WE'LL FACE
YOUR DEMONS TOGETHER.

22:04.105 --> 22:05.498
YOU WIN.

22:29.739 --> 22:32.960
OCTAVIA, VOICE-OVER:
CONCLAVE RULES. CONCLAVE RULES.

22:34.570 --> 22:37.660
WIN THE FIGHT,
SAVE YOUR LIFE.

22:55.374 --> 22:57.376
I USED TO RESENT WHEN YOU
WOULD LOOK AT HER LIKE THAT.

22:57.419 --> 23:00.030
-GAIA.
-I DON'T ANYMORE.

23:01.597 --> 23:04.426
I AM GLAD OCTAVIA
CAME TO YOU.

23:04.470 --> 23:06.863
SHE WAS ALWAYS MORE WARRIOR
THAN I.

23:06.907 --> 23:10.432
I AM SORRY
THAT I WASN'T.

23:10.476 --> 23:13.827
I'M THE ONE
WHO'S SORRY.

23:13.870 --> 23:16.569
MY CHILD,
DON'T YOU KNOW?

23:18.440 --> 23:20.399
YOU'RE MY SEDA.

23:24.577 --> 23:26.187
HERE THEY COME!

23:27.580 --> 23:28.929
ON ME!

23:28.972 --> 23:30.496
GAIA!

23:44.640 --> 23:47.687
WHAT WAS THAT?
WHY OPEN THE BRIDGE
AND NOT USE IT?

23:47.730 --> 23:51.560
INDRA: THEY USED IT.
SOMEONE'S HERE.

23:53.040 --> 23:54.650
I CAN FEEL IT.

23:54.694 --> 23:56.609
GAIA: THEY'RE HERE
FOR MADI.

23:56.652 --> 23:58.175
GO WARN CLARKE.
I'LL STAY AND MAKE SURE

23:58.219 --> 23:59.829
NO ONE ELSE COMES THROUGH.

23:59.873 --> 24:01.918
I'M NOT LEAVING
YOU AGAIN.

24:01.962 --> 24:03.572
OCTAVIA: I'LL GO.

24:13.930 --> 24:15.062
AHH.

24:40.914 --> 24:42.742
CLARKE: THEY'RE HERE
FOR MADI.

24:42.785 --> 24:45.179
WHERE IS SHE?

24:45.222 --> 24:46.746
WE HAD A FIGHT.

24:49.662 --> 24:51.141
I HAVE TO FIND HER.

24:52.839 --> 24:54.318
HMM.

24:55.581 --> 24:56.625
CLARKE: MADI!

25:06.243 --> 25:08.681
HEY. I LIKE
THAT SONG.

25:13.599 --> 25:16.210
HOPE: HA HA HA!
WHAT? NO. HA HA HA!

25:21.258 --> 25:22.782
UM...

25:26.220 --> 25:28.091
I'M--I'M SORRY. I...

25:33.444 --> 25:36.230
GABRIEL: THIS IS THE PART
WHERE YOU GO AFTER HER,
MI HERMANO.

25:40.582 --> 25:42.976
HI, MADI.

25:43.019 --> 25:44.717
NIYLAH: MADI'S HERE?

25:46.936 --> 25:49.112
OHH.

25:49.156 --> 25:50.853
THERE SHE IS.

25:55.118 --> 25:57.425
IT'S OK, NIYLAH.
YOU CAN DRINK
IN FRONT OF ME.

25:57.468 --> 25:59.688
UH, SHE'S HAD ENOUGH
ANYWAY.

25:59.732 --> 26:02.996
NIYLAH: WHAT?
I'M FINE.

26:03.039 --> 26:04.606
MADI?

26:04.650 --> 26:07.000
IF YOU CAN HEAR ME...

26:07.043 --> 26:09.045
OCTAVIA: SHE WASN'T
ON LEVEL 6 EITHER.

26:12.048 --> 26:14.747
THERE'S 4 MORE LEVELS.
WE'LL FIND HER.

26:16.139 --> 26:18.315
OK.

26:27.803 --> 26:29.283
THE PARTY'S OVER.

26:31.285 --> 26:32.634
GROWNUPS.

26:38.335 --> 26:41.164
WILL YOU PLAY
SOMETHING ELSE?

26:41.208 --> 26:44.733
AHH. I'LL DO BETTER
THAN THAT.

26:44.777 --> 26:48.041
HAVE A SEAT.
I'LL TEACH YOU.

26:48.084 --> 26:50.870
-REALLY?
-YEAH. IT'S EASY.

26:50.913 --> 26:54.961
IT'S ONLY TAKEN ME
200 YEARS TO FIGURE OUT. HEH.

26:55.004 --> 26:56.440
MADI?

26:58.355 --> 26:59.792
ANSWER ME!

26:59.835 --> 27:02.664
HANDS LIKE THIS. OK.

27:06.102 --> 27:07.713
GABRIEL:
WE'RE GONNA PLAY A C.

27:10.324 --> 27:11.586
MADI!

27:25.078 --> 27:26.427
YOU'RE DRUNK.

27:28.081 --> 27:29.648
AND YOU SAID YOU
WERE TIRED,

27:29.691 --> 27:32.607
BUT YOU'RE STILL UP,
SO...

27:37.220 --> 27:39.832
WHY ARE YOU
STILL UP, ECHO?

27:39.875 --> 27:41.224
NOT ECHO.

27:43.400 --> 27:44.663
ASH.

27:47.404 --> 27:49.668
MY NAME IS ASH.

27:49.711 --> 27:52.366
DON'T WORRY. I NEVER
TOLD BELLAMY EITHER.

27:53.846 --> 27:55.543
6 YEARS,

27:55.586 --> 27:58.633
AND I NEVER
TOLD HIM MY REAL NAME.

27:58.677 --> 28:01.723
EVERY DAY, I'D WAKE UP
AND THINK TO MYSELF

28:01.767 --> 28:03.507
"TODAY'S THE DAY."

28:05.727 --> 28:08.208
BUT NO.

28:08.251 --> 28:10.253
WHEN I FINALLY TOLD SOMEONE,

28:10.297 --> 28:12.038
IT WAS TO SAVE MY LIFE.

28:15.345 --> 28:17.434
ECHO WAS A COWARD.

28:18.784 --> 28:20.002
NO.

28:22.483 --> 28:26.705
NOT A COWARD.
HUMAN.

28:28.489 --> 28:32.623
I WANTED HIM TO SEE ME
AS THIS PERSON I'VE BECOME,

28:32.667 --> 28:37.324
NOT PITY ME FOR WHO I WAS
OR WHAT I WENT THROUGH OR--

28:37.367 --> 28:39.848
HE DID. HE WOULDN'T
HAVE STAYED WITH YOU
THAT LONG

28:39.892 --> 28:42.721
IF HE COULDN'T SEE
THE REAL YOU, ECHO.

28:53.514 --> 28:55.646
I MEAN ASH.

28:57.561 --> 29:01.130
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
WITH SECRETS.

29:01.174 --> 29:04.220
I WAS NAMED
FOR QUEEN NIA.

29:04.264 --> 29:07.920
WHAT? BUT YOU'RE TRIKRU.

29:07.963 --> 29:11.358
MY FATHER'S SIDE.

29:11.401 --> 29:13.534
MY MOTHER WAS AZGEDA.

29:13.577 --> 29:16.058
THAT'S WHY WE LIVED
SO FAR OUT IN THE WOODS.

29:18.408 --> 29:20.715
SO NO ONE WOULD SEE
HER SCARS.

29:25.720 --> 29:28.941
WE ARE WHO WE
CHOOSE TO BE,

29:28.984 --> 29:31.726
AND WE DON'T OWE
ANYONE OUR PAIN.

29:39.299 --> 29:41.388
WHAT IS TAKING YOU
SO LONG?

29:45.131 --> 29:47.655
MIRACLES TAKE TIME.

29:47.698 --> 29:50.963
HERO MURPHY'S KIND
OF FREAKING ME OUT.

29:51.006 --> 29:53.530
I KNOW...

29:53.574 --> 29:55.837
BUT IT'S HOT.

29:55.881 --> 29:57.839
I'M RIGHT HERE,
AND ALSO I'M NOT A HERO.

29:57.883 --> 29:59.623
I JUST THINK THE PEOPLE
ON SANCTUM DESERVE

29:59.667 --> 30:01.669
TO LIVE ON A PLANET
THAT DOESN'T EAT THEM

30:01.712 --> 30:03.802
OR OCCASIONALLY DRIVE
THEM INSANE.

30:22.995 --> 30:24.518
MURPHY: HEY.

30:24.561 --> 30:28.043
WE HAVEN'T, UH,
PROPERLY MET. I AM--

30:28.087 --> 30:30.132
JOHN MURPHY.

30:30.176 --> 30:32.352
I'VE HEARD STORIES.

30:32.395 --> 30:33.919
I TEND TO PLAY WELL
IN STORIES.

30:33.962 --> 30:37.444
HMM. NOT THESE.

30:37.487 --> 30:40.403
THOSE STORIES. YES.

30:42.536 --> 30:44.451
YOU OK?

30:45.931 --> 30:48.281
JORDAN: HEY, MURPHY.

30:48.324 --> 30:50.936
I...GOT THIS.

30:53.242 --> 30:56.811
OK. I WAS HIS FAVORITE,
THOUGH,

30:56.855 --> 30:58.465
WASN'T I, JORDAN?

31:03.296 --> 31:05.820
JORDAN: I AM SORRY
I UPSET YOU.

31:05.864 --> 31:09.476
I HAVEN'T SPENT A LOT
OF TIME WITH PEOPLE, AND...

31:09.519 --> 31:12.218
SOMETIMES I JUST
MISREAD THINGS.

31:12.261 --> 31:14.263
YEAH. ME, TOO. HEH.

31:28.843 --> 31:30.236
I WAS HAVING FUN
DANCING,

31:30.279 --> 31:33.369
-AND I THOUGHT YOU--
-I WAS.

31:33.413 --> 31:36.546
I JUST STARTED
TO FEEL GUILTY.

31:36.590 --> 31:37.939
I KNOW.

31:40.420 --> 31:42.291
I FELT THE SAME
WHEN I WOKE FROM CRYO

31:42.335 --> 31:44.076
AND MY PARENTS
WERE GONE.

31:45.860 --> 31:48.210
IT TAKES TIME,
BUT IT DOES GET EASIER.

31:56.566 --> 31:58.003
WE SHOULD GET BACK.

31:58.046 --> 31:59.526
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
DANCE IF YOU--

31:59.569 --> 32:01.876
LET'S DANCE HERE.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.704
-THERE'S NO MUSIC.
-MMM.

32:13.757 --> 32:15.237
OK.

32:15.281 --> 32:16.543
HA HA!

32:18.414 --> 32:19.894
OK.

32:28.642 --> 32:32.080
CLARKE: MADI,
WHERE ARE YOU?

32:32.124 --> 32:34.169
MADI! MADI!

32:34.213 --> 32:35.823
HOPE: CLARKE?
MURPHY: HEY, HEY. WHAT?

32:35.866 --> 32:37.172
WHOA, WHOA.
WHAT HAPPENED?

32:37.216 --> 32:39.261
CLARKE: IS MADI
WITH YOU?

32:39.305 --> 32:41.916
DID YOU FIX IT?
I NEED TO FIND THE STONE.

32:41.960 --> 32:45.137
MURPHY: OH, NOW YOU
WANT TO FIND THE STONE?

32:45.180 --> 32:47.530
I'M SORRY, MURPHY.
YOU WERE RIGHT.

32:47.574 --> 32:48.967
WE NEED TO LEAVE.

32:49.010 --> 32:51.056
RAVEN: WHY?
WHAT HAPPENED?

32:51.099 --> 32:52.579
DISCIPLES ARE AFTER MADI.

32:52.622 --> 32:53.884
HAS ANYONE SEEN HER?

32:53.928 --> 32:56.017
SHE'S IN THE REC ROOM.

32:56.061 --> 32:58.585
CLARKE: YOU'RE SURE?
HOPE: YEAH.

32:58.628 --> 33:01.631
SHEIDHEDA: UNH!
OCTAVIA: OHH!

33:01.675 --> 33:04.895
CLARKE: NO, NO, NO.
NO, NO!

33:04.939 --> 33:06.332
MADI!

33:07.507 --> 33:08.769
MADI!

33:08.812 --> 33:13.295
E, E, F, G.

33:13.339 --> 33:15.515
YEAH. IT'S THAT EASY.

33:15.558 --> 33:18.344
IT'S ONLY 5 NOTES,
BUT...

33:18.387 --> 33:21.477
YEAH, IT ALMOST
FEELS...FAMILIAR.

33:21.521 --> 33:25.438
HMM. THAT IS THE BEAUTY
OF MR. BEETHOVEN.

33:25.481 --> 33:28.789
OK. TRY AGAIN,
BUT THIS TIME, I WANT--

33:50.680 --> 33:51.942
AAH!

33:51.986 --> 33:54.206
OHH, OHH, HELP!
GET AWAY FROM ME!

33:54.249 --> 33:57.557
UNH! AAH! AAH!

33:57.600 --> 33:59.602
SHEIDHEDA: HUH!

33:59.646 --> 34:01.169
AHH.

34:04.651 --> 34:07.045
HELLO, MADI.

34:07.088 --> 34:12.615
IT SEEMS YOU'RE THE KEY
TO THE TRANSCENDENCE
OF THE HUMAN RACE.

34:12.659 --> 34:15.314
THEY SENT ME
TO BRING YOU BACK,

34:15.357 --> 34:18.056
BUT, YOU SEE,

34:18.099 --> 34:21.668
I DON'T WANT TO
TRANSCEND.

34:21.711 --> 34:24.410
I WANT TO REIGN.

34:24.453 --> 34:26.629
THEY GAVE ME A CHOICE--

34:26.673 --> 34:31.199
USE THESE TO BRING
YOU BACK PEACEFULLY

34:31.243 --> 34:34.115
OR THIS...

34:34.159 --> 34:36.857
IF YOU WOULDN'T GO
WILLINGLY.

34:39.120 --> 34:41.818
I PREFER OPTION 3--

34:43.907 --> 34:47.868
TO GUT YOU LIKE A PIG.

34:50.566 --> 34:51.828
GABRIEL: GO!

34:53.482 --> 34:55.832
INDRA'S IN THE ROTUNDA.
GET HELP!

35:01.273 --> 35:03.405
HELP! CLARKE!

35:06.887 --> 35:08.628
MADI: HELP!

35:08.671 --> 35:11.326
GAIA, INDRA!

35:11.370 --> 35:12.893
GAIA: DO YOU HEAR THAT?

35:12.936 --> 35:14.938
MADI: HELP!
GAIA: IT SOUNDS LIKE MADI.

35:16.853 --> 35:19.334
WE LET THEM IN.
ON ME.

35:19.378 --> 35:22.032
MADI: GABRIEL NEEDS HELP!

35:22.076 --> 35:23.512
GAIA: MADI?
MADI: HE'S HERE!

35:23.556 --> 35:26.298
-MADI, WHAT IS IT?
-HELP! NO!

35:28.778 --> 35:29.823
YOU.

35:29.866 --> 35:31.346
SHEIDHEDA: ME.

35:34.741 --> 35:35.872
US.

35:35.916 --> 35:37.483
GAIA: MADI, CLEAR OUT.

35:39.224 --> 35:40.660
YAAH!

35:58.373 --> 36:00.158
RAAH!

36:00.201 --> 36:01.681
AGH!

36:08.775 --> 36:10.342
AGH!

36:10.385 --> 36:12.605
UNH. NOT TODAY.

36:12.648 --> 36:14.172
AAH!

36:29.709 --> 36:31.145
CLARKE: MURPHY,
GIVE IT UP.

36:31.189 --> 36:32.494
IT'S NEVER GONNA BREAK.

36:34.844 --> 36:36.803
YOU WERE SAYING?

36:36.846 --> 36:38.108
JORDAN: NICE JOB, MURPHY.

36:38.152 --> 36:39.719
ALL IN A DAY'S WORK,
MY FRIENDS.

36:39.762 --> 36:41.808
CLARKE: THANKS, MURPHY.
ALL RIGHT. LET'S GO.

36:53.559 --> 36:54.995
GABRIEL.

36:55.038 --> 36:57.476
NO, NO, NO, NO.

36:59.869 --> 37:01.784
HOPE...MY FRIEND.

37:01.828 --> 37:05.005
I'M RIGHT HERE.
I'M WITH YOU.

37:05.048 --> 37:07.312
CLARKE: WHERE IS SHE?

37:07.355 --> 37:08.704
MADI.

37:11.185 --> 37:12.447
SHEIDHEDA.

37:14.536 --> 37:17.060
I TRIED. UNH.

37:17.104 --> 37:19.498
MADI: I'M RIGHT HERE.

37:19.541 --> 37:22.457
THANK GOD.
ARE YOU HURT?

37:25.417 --> 37:27.070
MADI: HE SAVED MY LIFE.

37:29.116 --> 37:31.901
SHEIDHEDA GOT AWAY.

37:31.945 --> 37:37.037
HE STABBED HIMSELF
IN THE GUT AND...DISAPPEARED.

37:37.080 --> 37:39.387
OCTAVIA: I KNOW
HOW THAT WORKS.

37:39.431 --> 37:41.563
CADOGAN WILL SEND
MORE DISCIPLES.

37:41.607 --> 37:44.305
CLARKE: WE HAVE TO GET
BACK TO SANCTUM NOW.

37:44.349 --> 37:46.873
THE STONE.

37:46.916 --> 37:48.222
FIND THE STONE.

37:48.266 --> 37:49.658
RAVEN: I COULDN'T FIX
THE HELMET.

37:49.702 --> 37:51.834
GABRIEL: SHEIDHEDA'S.
HE LEFT IT.

37:58.450 --> 38:00.234
IT'S DAMAGED.
IT CAN'T PINPOINT

38:00.278 --> 38:01.801
THE EXACT LOCATION.

38:04.282 --> 38:05.587
THE STONE'S HERE.

38:07.502 --> 38:08.938
MILLER: WHAT'D WE MISS?

38:12.377 --> 38:15.380
-TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.
-I DON'T KNOW.

38:15.423 --> 38:18.339
GABRIEL: NO.
NO, NO, NO, NO.

38:18.383 --> 38:20.123
I'M READY.

38:21.864 --> 38:24.171
MURPHY: WHAT DO YOU MEAN
THE STONE'S HERE? WHERE?

38:24.214 --> 38:25.694
I DON'T KNOW.

38:25.738 --> 38:27.217
WE FIND IT,

38:27.261 --> 38:29.350
WE GO BACK TO SANCTUM,
WE GET OUR ARMY.

38:29.394 --> 38:33.006
MADI: CLARKE, YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO WAR OVER ME.

38:33.049 --> 38:35.965
IF THEY TRY TO
TAKE YOU, I AM.

38:36.009 --> 38:37.706
MURPHY: ALL OF US ARE.

38:40.927 --> 38:43.495
NO ONE ELSE IS GETTING
KILLED TRYING TO PROTECT ME.

38:50.328 --> 38:52.373
MADI!

38:52.417 --> 38:54.810
-MAYBE I SHOULD JUST--
-ABSOLUTELY NOT.

38:54.854 --> 38:56.334
GABRIEL: UNH!

38:57.596 --> 38:58.814
DO SOMETHING!

38:58.858 --> 39:02.122
HOPE, I WANT THIS.
IT'S OK.

39:03.906 --> 39:05.865
OCTAVIA: IN PEACE,
MAY YOU LEAVE THIS SHORE.

39:05.908 --> 39:08.128
IN LOVE...

39:08.171 --> 39:09.477
NO.

39:09.521 --> 39:11.697
MAY YOU FIND THE NEXT.

39:11.740 --> 39:15.396
SAFE PASSAGE
ON YOUR TRAVELS

39:15.440 --> 39:18.530
UNTIL OUR FINAL JOURNEY
ON THE GROUND.

39:20.749 --> 39:21.968
MAY WE MEET AGAIN.

39:22.011 --> 39:24.013
OTHERS: MAY WE MEET AGAIN.

39:31.543 --> 39:33.153
GOD!

39:40.421 --> 39:42.684
MADI?

39:42.728 --> 39:44.469
MADI?!

39:46.296 --> 39:47.646
THE VENT.

39:47.689 --> 39:48.951
WHAT?

39:54.522 --> 39:57.743
RAVEN, MURPHY,
FIND THAT STONE!

39:57.786 --> 40:00.180
GAIA: MADI, PUT
THE KNIFE DOWN.

40:00.223 --> 40:01.747
DON'T TAKE
ANOTHER STEP.

40:03.270 --> 40:05.359
INDRA: I AM SORRY.
I DID NOT KNOW

40:05.403 --> 40:07.361
WHAT SHE WANTED
UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE.

40:07.405 --> 40:09.798
MADI: OCTAVIA SAID CADOGAN WOULD
JUST KEEP SENDING MORE PEOPLE

40:09.842 --> 40:11.234
UNTIL HE GETS ME.

40:11.278 --> 40:13.323
NO ONE WILL EVER BE SAFE.

40:13.367 --> 40:15.717
GAIA: MADI, PLEASE
DON'T DO THIS.

40:15.761 --> 40:18.590
MADI: I TOLD YOU NO ONE
ELSE IS DYING TO SAVE ME.

40:18.633 --> 40:22.028
MADI...PLEASE.

40:23.203 --> 40:24.552
I LOVE YOU, CLARKE.

40:24.596 --> 40:26.685
-NO!
-UNH!

40:38.914 --> 40:40.350
HOPE: BE PREPARED!

40:40.394 --> 40:41.743
THEY'LL BE INVISIBLE.

40:47.662 --> 40:50.230
BOMB!

40:50.273 --> 40:51.492
HYAH!

41:17.518 --> 41:19.085
WHAT THE HELL
WAS THAT?

41:30.575 --> 41:32.228
EMORI, IT WAS NOTHING.
COME BACK.

41:32.272 --> 41:34.317
QUIET. LISTEN.
