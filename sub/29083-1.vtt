- Go, go, go!
- Go, go!

02:51.540 --> 02:53.308
Yes! Yes!

02:54.642 --> 02:56.243
Oh, my God!

03:08.856 --> 03:10.257
<i>Don't cry.</i>

03:11.125 --> 03:13.861
<i>Don't let 'em
see you cry, Haley.</i>

03:13.994 --> 03:16.097
<i>You will get them next time.</i>

03:19.568 --> 03:21.702
All right?
'Cause what are you?

03:23.270 --> 03:25.340
Huh? What are you?

03:26.374 --> 03:27.675
The apex predator.

03:27.808 --> 03:29.311
Yeah, you are.

03:29.844 --> 03:32.046
Apex predator. All day.

03:38.520 --> 03:40.721
- Hey, what's up?
- <i>Is everything okay?</i>

03:40.855 --> 03:42.089
<i>I've been calling you
all morning.</i>

03:42.223 --> 03:44.426
Sorry.
Late night, early practice.

03:44.559 --> 03:48.162
<i>You're having practice during a hurricane?</i>

03:48.295 --> 03:53.701
<i>More than one million people now
facing mandatory evacuation orders.</i>

03:53.834 --> 03:55.269
They said it was gonna miss us.

03:55.403 --> 03:56.605
<i>Don't you get alerts
on your phone?</i>

03:56.737 --> 03:58.072
<i>It's gonna hit really hard.</i>

03:58.205 --> 04:00.241
- <i>Louie, honey.</i>
- Hey, bubba. Look at you.

04:00.375 --> 04:01.809
Hi. Hi.

04:01.942 --> 04:04.412
<i>Anyway, Haley, listen.
Have you heard from Dad?</i>

04:04.546 --> 04:05.846
No. Why?

04:05.980 --> 04:07.781
<i>Oh, he's not answering my calls.</i>

04:07.915 --> 04:09.717
Well, he probably had
a late night too.

04:09.850 --> 04:11.553
<i>Yeah, I just need to know
he's okay.</i>

04:11.719 --> 04:13.455
<i>They've already evacuated
the whole south coast.</i>

04:13.588 --> 04:15.089
Well, maybe he left already.

04:15.222 --> 04:16.591
<i>Or maybe he's doing
something stupid,</i>

04:16.724 --> 04:17.757
<i>like trying to ride it out.</i>

04:17.892 --> 04:19.427
<i>You know what he's like.</i>

04:20.529 --> 04:22.229
Well, what does Mom say?

04:22.696 --> 04:24.298
<i>Mom's in Paris.</i>

04:24.432 --> 04:26.601
Ah, with Prince Charming?

04:26.734 --> 04:28.202
<i>Give her a break.</i>

04:28.336 --> 04:29.638
<i>Dad should've
returned my calls by now.</i>

04:29.770 --> 04:31.105
<i>He always does.</i>

04:31.238 --> 04:33.073
Look, I'll drive down
and check on him.

04:33.207 --> 04:35.843
- <i>Are you crazy?</i>
- 75 South will be empty.

04:35.976 --> 04:37.612
I can be there
in, like, two hours.

04:37.745 --> 04:40.114
<i>I'm not having both of you
down there in a Category 5.</i>

04:40.247 --> 04:43.284
- Then why did you call me?
- <i>Because I thought you might have heard from him.</i>

04:43.418 --> 04:44.785
Well, I haven't.

04:45.387 --> 04:46.588
Not for a while.

04:47.455 --> 04:49.558
- <i>Did you fight again?</i>
- He fights with me.

04:49.690 --> 04:51.825
<i>Because you're exactly alike.</i>

04:51.959 --> 04:54.094
Yeah, and you're more like Mom.

04:54.228 --> 04:56.697
Empathetic from a safe distance.

04:57.898 --> 04:59.334
<i>Okay, forget it.</i>

04:59.467 --> 05:01.101
- Beth, I gotta go.
- <i>Stay safe.</i>

05:01.235 --> 05:02.736
<i>If you hear from him, text me.</i>

05:02.870 --> 05:04.905
- Okay. I love you.
- <i>Love you too.</i>

05:05.640 --> 05:07.942
- <i>Bye.</i>
- Bye, little cutie.

05:08.677 --> 05:10.878
<i>...maybe 150 miles per hour.</i>

05:11.011 --> 05:14.715
<i>That is ridiculous.
That can't be true.</i>

05:14.848 --> 05:17.017
<i>I'm telling you,
if you think that's funny, get this.</i>

05:17.151 --> 05:18.620
- <i>Go ahead.</i>
- <i>Pasco County</i>

05:18.752 --> 05:20.355
<i>sheriff's office
have warned people</i>

05:20.488 --> 05:22.324
<i>to not shoot guns
into the hurricane.</i>

05:22.457 --> 05:24.526
<i>What?
You can't shoot guns in a hurricane?</i>

05:24.659 --> 05:25.960
<i>Well, it's dangerous!</i>

05:26.093 --> 05:28.363
<i>Florida is a stand-your-ground
state after all.</i>

05:28.496 --> 05:32.032
<i>Hell yeah, it is!
That's why I'm here.</i>

05:36.638 --> 05:39.073
<i>You've reached Dave Keller,
Dave Keller Construction.</i>

05:39.206 --> 05:42.042
<i>Probably up a ladder somewhere,
so please leave a message.</i>

05:42.176 --> 05:46.481
Dad, it's Haley. Call me back.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.750
Beth's worried about you.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.422
Okay.

05:55.624 --> 05:58.292
Oh, man. What a shit show.

05:59.394 --> 06:01.895
I swear to God,
if you've already left...

06:08.902 --> 06:12.474
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.
Slow down, slow down.

06:15.242 --> 06:17.612
Sorry, miss, we can't let you...

06:18.045 --> 06:19.481
Haley! What's up?

06:19.614 --> 06:20.948
Hey, Wayne.

06:21.549 --> 06:23.284
How's it going?

06:23.418 --> 06:26.120
We've had better days.
The evacuation drives people nuts.

06:26.253 --> 06:27.955
This guy tried to go around.

06:28.088 --> 06:29.290
No hurricane party this year?

06:29.424 --> 06:31.760
I don't think so.

06:31.892 --> 06:35.430
Hey, how's your sister? Your old
man says she's living up in Boston.

06:35.563 --> 06:37.197
Yeah. Yeah, she's good.

06:37.332 --> 06:39.867
She actually asked me
to go check on him.

06:40.635 --> 06:44.004
Uh, I'm afraid
I can't let you do that.

06:44.138 --> 06:46.073
The storm's turning west
and heading straight for us.

06:46.206 --> 06:47.941
- We're not letting anyone through.
- Come on, Wayne.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.344
He's not answering his phone.

06:49.477 --> 06:50.645
Look, I know the roads.

06:50.779 --> 06:52.580
I'll be in and out, I promise.

06:55.483 --> 06:59.086
I'm really sorry, Haley.
I wish I could help you out, but I just...

06:59.219 --> 07:01.288
I can't.
I wouldn't want you to get hurt.

07:02.557 --> 07:04.058
Okay, I understand.

07:04.191 --> 07:06.661
Maybe you could check on him
later if you get a chance?

07:06.795 --> 07:08.630
- Sure, I'll try.
- Thanks.

07:08.763 --> 07:09.997
Drive safe.

07:10.699 --> 07:12.933
Uh, say hi
to your sister for me.

07:13.668 --> 07:15.303
- Sure.
- Okay.

07:20.342 --> 07:21.875
Turn around.

07:36.391 --> 07:37.592
Fuck it.

07:39.193 --> 07:42.863
Hey! Hey! Hey! Stop!

07:44.298 --> 07:46.967
All roads are closed up ahead.

07:47.101 --> 07:48.737
Uh, come in.

07:48.869 --> 07:50.104
Stop!

07:50.938 --> 07:52.674
Just wait!
Stay where you are.

07:53.273 --> 07:55.109
<i>It looks
like Wendy's now gonna go</i>

07:55.242 --> 07:57.077
<i>right through the middle
of our state.</i>

07:57.211 --> 08:01.115
<i>We strongly urge local residents to
listen to all warnings from officials.</i>

08:01.248 --> 08:03.884
<i>If you're in an evacuation zone,
you gotta get out.</i>

08:04.017 --> 08:05.553
<i>You can't wait.</i>

08:05.687 --> 08:08.956
<i>We... We won't be able
to come for you.</i>

08:10.090 --> 08:12.394
<i>I hope every parent in the state
is thinking,</i>

08:13.127 --> 08:15.463
<i>"How do I keep my family safe?"</i>

08:53.835 --> 08:56.538
Dad?

09:06.681 --> 09:08.148
Dad?

09:09.551 --> 09:11.218
Dad!

09:11.352 --> 09:14.456
Hi. Hey, Sugar.

09:14.589 --> 09:15.623
Hey, girl.

09:16.023 --> 09:17.559
Where's Daddy?

09:17.692 --> 09:19.126
I missed you.

09:19.259 --> 09:21.696
Where's Dad, hey?
Where is he?

09:53.994 --> 09:56.196
<i>No sign of
Dad, but Sugar's here.</i>

09:56.331 --> 09:58.232
He wouldn't have gone
without her.

09:58.366 --> 10:01.001
It's weird. It's like a ghost town.
Everyone's gone.

10:01.134 --> 10:04.004
<i>Please,
just get yourself somewhere safe,</i>

10:04.137 --> 10:06.307
<i>even if you have to
stop at a shelter.</i>

10:06.441 --> 10:08.343
You think he went
to the old house?

10:08.476 --> 10:11.211
<i>No, I think it's been in
escrow since the divorce.</i>

10:11.346 --> 10:14.816
Beth, there's pictures of you,
me, and Mom laid out everywhere.

10:15.683 --> 10:18.720
This condo is horrible.
It's depressing.

10:18.853 --> 10:23.023
<i>Haley, you have to stop blaming them.
It was their mutual decision.</i>

10:23.791 --> 10:25.960
Whatever.
I'm gonna check the house.

10:26.093 --> 10:28.061
- <i>No, don't you dare. I'm not hav...</i>
- Hey, I bumped into

10:28.195 --> 10:29.964
your ex-boyfriend Wayne
on the way down.

10:30.097 --> 10:31.766
<i>He was not my boyfriend.</i>

10:31.900 --> 10:34.936
Whatever you say. I still remember
the time Dad caught you guys.

10:35.068 --> 10:38.506
<i>Stop! Oh, my God. How do you remember that?
You were like...</i>

10:38.640 --> 10:40.140
I was eight.

10:40.274 --> 10:41.910
- <i>God.</i>
- Scarred me for life.

10:42.042 --> 10:43.778
<i>I'm never gonna live that down.</i>

10:43.912 --> 10:46.079
No. Never ever.

10:57.892 --> 10:59.059
Don't give me that look.

10:59.293 --> 11:01.128
I was gonna visit more.
I just...

11:02.062 --> 11:03.230
got busy.

11:03.731 --> 11:05.833
I'm trying to have
a life of my own, you know.

11:06.401 --> 11:08.168
I love visiting the swamp.

11:08.937 --> 11:11.271
Heat, humidity,

11:12.139 --> 11:13.775
mosquitoes.

11:14.943 --> 11:16.311
What's not to like, eh?

11:16.444 --> 11:18.245
Oh, yeah, except you.

11:18.713 --> 11:20.415
My little fur baby.

11:46.874 --> 11:48.576
Oh, thank God.

12:05.026 --> 12:06.794
Come on, Sugar.

12:25.212 --> 12:26.581
Dad!

12:36.024 --> 12:37.392
Hello?

12:59.179 --> 13:00.815
Dad, you here?

13:08.856 --> 13:10.257
Dad?

13:23.371 --> 13:25.740
Marco! Polo! Anybody?

13:32.113 --> 13:33.347
Dad!

13:39.587 --> 13:40.788
Dad!

14:00.007 --> 14:01.175
Where is he, girl?

14:05.513 --> 14:07.548
Come on.

14:27.168 --> 14:29.437
Shit.

14:56.497 --> 14:57.865
Oh, my God.

15:20.021 --> 15:21.856
Sugar? What is it, girl?

15:30.131 --> 15:31.432
Shit.

15:32.967 --> 15:35.803
Is he there?
Can you hear him? Dad?

15:36.404 --> 15:38.873
Dad? Dad!

15:41.843 --> 15:43.911
I gotta go down there, don't I?

15:46.747 --> 15:47.782
Okay.

15:56.123 --> 15:57.525
Ah.

15:58.059 --> 15:59.360
Okay.

15:59.961 --> 16:01.128
It's cool.

16:02.697 --> 16:04.932
Cable guys do it
all the time.

16:14.175 --> 16:15.409
Dad?

16:26.487 --> 16:27.989
Stay here, okay?

16:38.065 --> 16:39.634
Uh!

17:08.229 --> 17:10.031
Ohh!

17:10.498 --> 17:11.799
Oh, God!

17:22.476 --> 17:23.778
Dad?

17:25.880 --> 17:27.481
Aww!

17:27.982 --> 17:29.684
Ugh, shit.

17:36.223 --> 17:37.525
Dad!

17:54.376 --> 17:56.077
I swear to God, Dad.

17:57.111 --> 18:00.047
Only you would come down here
in a frickin' hurricane.

18:01.350 --> 18:05.119
<i>Hard and loud.
Florida's best hard and heavy music.</i>

18:05.252 --> 18:07.456

18:45.092 --> 18:46.127

18:47.995 --> 18:49.764
Dad. No.

18:49.897 --> 18:50.931
Shit.

18:58.539 --> 18:59.874
Shit.

19:01.275 --> 19:03.878
Oh, shit. Daddy.

19:04.312 --> 19:05.679
Dad.

19:14.523 --> 19:16.491
Okay, you're breathing.
All right.

19:16.624 --> 19:18.826
What's happened? Dad?

19:20.227 --> 19:21.262
Oh, my God.

19:22.696 --> 19:27.601
Okay. We need to get to a hospital,
all right? We need to go right now.

19:28.470 --> 19:29.703
Okay.

19:43.150 --> 19:44.185
Fuck.

20:26.361 --> 20:27.395
Okay.

<i>Windows

20:42.511 --> 20:46.046
<i>Sunday morning

21:04.798 --> 21:06.368
We're almost there, Dad.

21:16.143 --> 21:18.012
Ahh! Shit!

21:22.551 --> 21:23.784
Oh, my...

21:37.332 --> 21:39.066
No, no.

23:14.329 --> 23:15.363
Dad.

23:18.799 --> 23:20.034
Beth?

23:22.737 --> 23:23.971
Beth?

23:24.439 --> 23:25.573
It's Haley, Dad.

23:37.117 --> 23:39.487
Hang on, hang on.

24:06.548 --> 24:07.682
Be careful.

24:08.148 --> 24:10.217
There's a big gator.

24:10.352 --> 24:13.321
Yeah, I know.
We've already met.

24:13.455 --> 24:15.289
How'd it even get down here?

24:19.461 --> 24:20.861
I don't know.

24:22.096 --> 24:23.964
It must've come through the...

24:24.098 --> 24:27.000
through the overflow drainpipe
on the lake side.

24:29.738 --> 24:32.607
Ohh.
Why did you come here?

24:34.007 --> 24:35.844
You're welcome.

24:35.976 --> 24:38.078
Listen to me.
Listen to me.

24:38.212 --> 24:41.181
You need to go. Now.

24:41.316 --> 24:44.084
- Not without you.
- I don't need your help.

24:49.156 --> 24:50.759
Ah, ah...

24:50.891 --> 24:53.293
Yeah,
I can clearly see that.

24:54.928 --> 24:57.599
Wait.

25:01.001 --> 25:02.035
Sugar?

25:02.169 --> 25:04.406
Yeah.
She helped me find you.

25:07.475 --> 25:08.510
You look good.

25:10.010 --> 25:12.179
You look like shit.

25:13.715 --> 25:15.215
What's with the beard?

25:15.949 --> 25:17.951
Oh, it's for
my Internet dating.

25:20.321 --> 25:22.424
What's happening
with the storm?

25:24.091 --> 25:26.394
It's pretty bad.
Everyone's gone.

25:26.528 --> 25:29.129
What are you even
doing here?

25:29.831 --> 25:31.231
I wanted to board up
some vents.

25:31.366 --> 25:34.234
I mean, in this house.
I thought you sold the place.

25:35.068 --> 25:36.704
Deal fell through.

25:44.144 --> 25:47.715
Oh, my God!
Oh, shit. What happened?

25:49.918 --> 25:53.187
Got tangled up in the pipes
when he tried to drag me.

25:53.321 --> 25:56.089
That's how I escaped.

25:56.223 --> 25:58.158
We're okay
on this side of the pipes.

25:58.292 --> 26:00.961
It's too big to get back here.

26:05.500 --> 26:07.201
I've gotta go get my phone.

26:07.335 --> 26:10.103
Nobody is coming
in this storm, Haley.

26:10.237 --> 26:11.673
I have to try.

26:13.173 --> 26:14.476
I'm getting us out of here.

26:14.609 --> 26:16.009
Okay, okay.

26:16.143 --> 26:19.012
Go this way.
It's safer. Okay.

26:19.146 --> 26:20.648
You keep your eye on him.

26:20.782 --> 26:22.784
They can't hear you
out of the water.

26:22.917 --> 26:24.586
They can see you in the dark.

26:25.620 --> 26:28.188
- They're not as fast out of...
- I know, Dad.

26:28.790 --> 26:30.157
Stay here.

26:30.290 --> 26:32.360
Well,
I thought I'd go for a run.

26:47.308 --> 26:49.544
Dad? Keep talking to me.

26:51.078 --> 26:53.180
How's your split
in the hundred free?

26:54.114 --> 26:57.217
- Really?
- You asked me to talk.

26:58.085 --> 27:00.187
We already talked
about the weather.

27:01.422 --> 27:02.857
I lost my last relay.

27:02.991 --> 27:05.960
- When?
- This morning at practice.

27:06.093 --> 27:07.629
By two hundredths.

27:07.762 --> 27:10.331
Two hundredths, that's nothing.
You got that.

27:11.366 --> 27:13.233
You just gotta want it, baby.

27:13.368 --> 27:18.071
If I lose my spot on the travel
team, I lose my scholarship.

27:19.541 --> 27:22.310
- Maybe I've reached my limit.
- No.

27:22.443 --> 27:25.780
I keep telling you, it's not your
body that's holding you back.

27:26.681 --> 27:28.449
Because what are you?

27:28.583 --> 27:30.217
You're not my coach anymore,
Dad.

27:30.351 --> 27:32.387
That apex-predator shit
doesn't help.

27:32.520 --> 27:35.490
I'm just saying, you could
believe in yourself a little more.

27:35.623 --> 27:37.692
Oh, yeah.
Look who's talking.

27:37.825 --> 27:40.193
Every athlete
reaches a plateau.

27:40.328 --> 27:42.129
- Dad, just stop.
- It's normal.

27:42.262 --> 27:44.231
I need to focus, okay?

27:45.065 --> 27:47.535
Haley,
just forget about the team.

27:47.669 --> 27:51.906
Just remember what got you into
swimming in the first place.

27:52.040 --> 27:53.073
You did.

27:54.375 --> 27:57.779
You're gonna blame me 'cause you have a gift.

27:57.912 --> 28:00.481
And I needed to kick you
in the butt a little.

28:01.248 --> 28:03.250
I know you, Haley.

28:07.689 --> 28:09.791
You're not gonna give up now.

28:11.258 --> 28:13.561
You don't know
anything about me.

29:24.297 --> 29:26.567
Yes.

29:39.347 --> 29:40.782
Ahh, Haley!

29:44.519 --> 29:46.521
No!

29:49.857 --> 29:51.359
Haley!

30:10.111 --> 30:11.713
Ah, ahh!

30:12.780 --> 30:14.682
Haley! No!

30:17.819 --> 30:19.320
Haley!

30:21.589 --> 30:22.724
Ahh!

30:26.594 --> 30:27.762
Ah!

30:48.916 --> 30:50.518
Ah, ahh!

30:58.092 --> 30:59.627
Ahh!

31:30.258 --> 31:31.626
Haley!

31:32.126 --> 31:33.694
Are you all right?

31:39.867 --> 31:41.035
Ah!

32:15.770 --> 32:16.904
Haley!

32:18.005 --> 32:20.041
Haley, answer me!

32:22.143 --> 32:23.377
Haley!

32:23.878 --> 32:24.912
Dad!

32:26.614 --> 32:28.049
There's two of 'em!

32:29.250 --> 32:30.751
Are you hurt?

32:33.955 --> 32:35.456
Are you hurt?

32:35.890 --> 32:37.091
I'm fine.

32:37.425 --> 32:39.660
You don't sound like
you're fine.

32:42.864 --> 32:44.065
I'm safe.

33:07.955 --> 33:09.423
Uhh.

35:00.402 --> 35:04.005
<i>The National Weather
Service has issued a flash flood warning</i>

35:04.138 --> 35:06.674
<i>for all of
southern and western Florida.</i>

35:06.807 --> 35:08.976
<i>Catastrophic levee failure

35:09.110 --> 35:11.645
<i>Residents should avoid
low-lying areas.</i>

35:11.779 --> 35:13.180
No shit.

35:21.122 --> 35:23.124
- Dad?
- Yeah?

35:23.257 --> 35:24.825
Can you see them?

35:26.461 --> 35:27.695
Hang on.

35:29.196 --> 35:30.365
Where are they?

35:31.565 --> 35:35.136
I'm gonna go to the front of the
house to see if I can call for help.

35:35.269 --> 35:38.739
I hear something moving
over near the stairs.

35:40.975 --> 35:42.910
I think
they're still over there.

36:44.105 --> 36:46.240
<i>The wind threat has increased</i>

36:46.374 --> 36:48.042
<i>from the previous assessment.</i>

37:30.084 --> 37:31.252
Ah.

37:31.386 --> 37:33.821
Dad! Dad, I see some people!

37:34.288 --> 37:36.023
Help! Help!

37:39.727 --> 37:42.129
- You check the register?
- Empty.

37:44.899 --> 37:47.302
- It's heavy.
- You got it? Wait, wait, wait.

37:51.071 --> 37:53.040
- You got it?
- Yeah.

37:56.311 --> 37:59.013
Whoo!
How we gonna open this baby?

37:59.146 --> 38:02.683
Who cares? Think of all the shit
we'll get with all this cash.

38:05.920 --> 38:07.755
Maybe it's empty too.

38:07.888 --> 38:09.823
Feels pretty loaded to me.

38:10.525 --> 38:11.992
Come on, Stan, time to go!

38:26.874 --> 38:29.810
Will you go get your brother?
We have to leave.

38:38.752 --> 38:40.788
Come on, Stan!

38:44.024 --> 38:46.428
What the fuck
are you doing? Marv!

38:46.561 --> 38:49.230
I think there's some
people in that house over there.

38:49.364 --> 38:50.931
Help!

38:55.604 --> 38:58.973
Help! Help!

38:59.106 --> 39:04.111
Marv! Marv, there's nothing there.
Let's go. You're gonna get shot.

39:10.851 --> 39:13.821
Hey! Hey, we're here!

39:14.322 --> 39:15.357
Come on!

39:15.956 --> 39:17.157
Please!

39:39.614 --> 39:42.049
See, I told you... Fuck!

39:49.658 --> 39:50.858
Shit.

39:52.394 --> 39:53.827
No!

39:54.228 --> 39:55.497
No!

40:11.680 --> 40:12.846
Stan!

40:12.980 --> 40:14.716
Stan, get out of the water!

40:14.848 --> 40:16.518
Get out of the water, Stan!

40:20.355 --> 40:21.389
Stan!

40:22.490 --> 40:23.525
Ah!

41:08.670 --> 41:10.904
Haley? Listen to me.

41:11.740 --> 41:13.408
There's another way out.

41:13.541 --> 41:16.176
Go over
to the other access hatch.

41:16.311 --> 41:18.278
By the entrance to the house.

41:19.279 --> 41:21.483
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah!

41:21.616 --> 41:25.320
Crawl along the foundation
till you reach the wet wall.

41:27.154 --> 41:28.723
They're all wet, Dad.

41:28.857 --> 41:30.625
No, listen.

41:30.759 --> 41:32.694
It's where all the pipes go up
into the house.

41:32.827 --> 41:36.230
But be careful.
You'll be pretty exposed over there.

41:36.997 --> 41:38.566
Okay.

43:08.021 --> 43:11.291
Ahh, ahh.

43:46.026 --> 43:47.795
Oh.

43:48.596 --> 43:50.565
Hey, Sugar. Hey.

43:50.698 --> 43:52.433
Good girl.

43:52.567 --> 43:54.101
Hey, girl.

43:54.602 --> 43:56.203
Good girl.

43:58.773 --> 44:00.207
Did you find it?

44:02.042 --> 44:03.611
Yeah, it's stuck.

44:06.614 --> 44:08.483
There's something on top of it.

44:09.149 --> 44:10.785
Is there a plan B?

44:10.919 --> 44:12.687
That was our plan B.

44:15.790 --> 44:18.960
In less than an hour,
this crawl space will be under water.

44:19.727 --> 44:21.996
What about
the overflow drainpipe?

44:22.129 --> 44:24.999
No. They came in from there.

44:25.132 --> 44:28.570
Come back to this side of the pipes.
We'll figure something out.

44:57.365 --> 44:59.299
There's somebody out there.

45:12.981 --> 45:14.582
Dad, it's the police!

45:14.716 --> 45:16.884
Help! Hello!

45:17.018 --> 45:18.920
- Hey!
- It's Wayne. Help!

45:29.831 --> 45:32.132
Stay with the boat.
I'll be right back.

45:46.514 --> 45:47.548
Haley?

45:51.319 --> 45:53.688
- Hey, Wayne!
- Wayne!

45:56.057 --> 45:57.392
Wayne!

45:57.892 --> 45:58.893
Down here!

45:59.627 --> 46:00.662
Wayne!

46:01.863 --> 46:02.897
Hey!

46:03.698 --> 46:05.165
Mr. Keller!

46:24.118 --> 46:25.185
Mr. Keller!

46:25.319 --> 46:27.755
Wayne! Wayne!

46:27.889 --> 46:29.657
- Wayne!
- Wayne!

46:31.159 --> 46:32.927
Wayne!

46:45.006 --> 46:46.007
Wayne!

46:46.140 --> 46:47.575
He's heading to the garage!

48:03.351 --> 48:04.585
Haley!

48:06.754 --> 48:08.055
Wayne?

48:09.323 --> 48:11.259
No, Wayne, wait! Stop!

48:11.392 --> 48:13.427
Stop! Wait, don't come down!

48:13.561 --> 48:15.496
- No! Stay there!
- Hey!

48:15.630 --> 48:18.666
Wait!
There's two gators down here!

48:19.901 --> 48:22.503
Okay, hold on.
Don't move. Hold on!

48:24.472 --> 48:27.308
Come in, Pete.

48:28.543 --> 48:29.644
Pete, you copy?

48:29.777 --> 48:31.579
<i>Pete, do you copy?</i>

48:35.383 --> 48:36.617
Pete, goddamn it, man.
Where are you?

48:36.751 --> 48:38.953
I need you down here now
with a snare pole!

48:40.488 --> 48:42.423
Pete, did you hear that?

49:07.081 --> 49:08.616
Help me!

49:09.650 --> 49:11.552
Haley, help me!

49:11.686 --> 49:13.888
Wayne!

49:20.461 --> 49:22.029
Grab my hand!

50:03.571 --> 50:04.839
I got you.

50:07.408 --> 50:08.843
I couldn't save him.

50:16.050 --> 50:18.052
It's okay. Shh.

50:19.053 --> 50:21.489
It's okay.
They can't get in here.

50:22.056 --> 50:23.457
We're safe here.

50:26.961 --> 50:27.929
Dad.

50:28.062 --> 50:29.096
Okay.

50:30.698 --> 50:32.900
Shh. It's okay.

50:33.034 --> 50:34.135
It's okay.

50:41.208 --> 50:43.611
I never thought
it would end like this.

50:44.745 --> 50:46.981
We should never have
come back here.

50:47.114 --> 50:50.785
Haley, you stay strong.
We're getting out of here.

51:01.062 --> 51:04.031
You remember
when you were little,

51:04.165 --> 51:08.235
and Beth could hold her breath for the
length of the pool and you couldn't?

51:08.370 --> 51:11.072
I'm not really up for
memory lane right now, Dad.

51:11.205 --> 51:14.875
Yeah, well, you got so mad
and you stormed off.

51:15.009 --> 51:17.478
Yeah, I was a little jerk.

51:17.611 --> 51:20.315
Yeah, well, Haley, that night,

51:20.449 --> 51:24.151
I woke up about 2:00 in the morning
'cause I heard something outside.

51:24.285 --> 51:26.421
I thought it was a burglar,
so I snuck down,

51:26.554 --> 51:28.457
and I saw you in the pool,

51:28.589 --> 51:31.926
taking your giant breaths
again and again.

51:33.362 --> 51:35.196
And you did it, Haley.

51:35.997 --> 51:38.866
You figured that shit out
all by yourself.

51:41.168 --> 51:45.039
And that's when I knew,
this kid's a fighter.

51:47.309 --> 51:50.678
So we may be stubborn,
but we do not give up.

51:53.482 --> 51:55.216
You gave up on Mom.

51:56.485 --> 51:59.520
Mom was not happy,
and I was selfish,

51:59.653 --> 52:01.423
and I didn't
pay enough attention to her.

52:01.555 --> 52:02.857
- Because of me.
- No.

52:02.990 --> 52:05.993
Yes, because you were
always with me.

52:06.127 --> 52:10.064
Every weekend at the meets.
On the road away from home.

52:10.197 --> 52:13.301
It had nothing to do with you.
Is that what you think?

52:21.008 --> 52:24.111
It was you and Beth
that kept us together.

52:25.646 --> 52:28.582
When you girls left,
we were just...

52:30.684 --> 52:34.021
two lonely people
in a big, empty house.

52:35.390 --> 52:37.758
Nobody to even pretend for.

52:39.361 --> 52:43.798
Your mom got a second chance,
Haley, and she deserves to be happy.

52:44.598 --> 52:45.933
So do you.

52:47.701 --> 52:49.937
I don't think I deserve one.

52:52.740 --> 52:54.208
I miss you.

52:55.242 --> 52:58.212
I miss seeing your face
in the stands when I win.

52:58.979 --> 53:00.549
Why don't you come
anymore?

53:00.681 --> 53:03.617
- I thought you were mad at me.
- I am!

53:04.419 --> 53:05.820
I know.

53:25.206 --> 53:29.110
We are gonna beat
these pea-brained lizard shits.

53:29.643 --> 53:31.112
You and me.

53:32.947 --> 53:35.950
They didn't like it
when I was banging on the pipes.

53:36.083 --> 53:38.819
I think I can distract them
if you can dive

53:38.953 --> 53:41.590
all the way under
until you get to the stairs.

53:41.722 --> 53:43.691
Yeah, I can do it.

53:45.092 --> 53:46.528
You ready?

53:46.660 --> 53:47.895
Yeah.

53:48.597 --> 53:50.532
I'm coming back for you, okay?

53:50.664 --> 53:52.233
You'd better.

53:54.668 --> 53:55.903
Okay.

54:26.767 --> 54:28.002
Okay.

54:48.356 --> 54:49.457
Go.

56:45.839 --> 56:47.141
Ahh!

57:10.398 --> 57:11.433
Dad?

57:11.733 --> 57:13.501
I can't make it to the stairs.

57:16.270 --> 57:18.640
I'm going for the drainpipe,
okay?

57:19.006 --> 57:20.240
No.

57:20.908 --> 57:22.410
It's too dangerous.

57:24.312 --> 57:25.447
You hear me?

57:28.849 --> 57:30.084
Haley?

58:14.462 --> 58:16.531
Oh.

58:39.119 --> 58:40.921
Oh, shit.

01:00:20.655 --> 01:00:22.089
Ah!

01:00:26.260 --> 01:00:27.729
Haley!

01:00:41.643 --> 01:00:44.111
Haley! Answer me!

01:00:45.914 --> 01:00:47.448
I killed one.

01:02:29.617 --> 01:02:31.719
Haley? Hey.

01:03:38.753 --> 01:03:39.787
Ah!

01:03:47.227 --> 01:03:48.463
Hey!

01:03:49.130 --> 01:03:51.866
We're over here! Help!

01:03:53.868 --> 01:03:56.637
Haley?

01:04:15.723 --> 01:04:16.891
Dad!

01:04:21.863 --> 01:04:23.831
Haley! Help!

01:04:26.334 --> 01:04:27.802
Haley!

01:04:55.096 --> 01:04:56.831
Dad, I'm coming!

01:05:21.789 --> 01:05:22.890
No!

01:05:23.024 --> 01:05:24.358
No.

01:05:24.492 --> 01:05:28.062
One, two, three, four.

01:05:30.965 --> 01:05:33.000
Come on! Wake up!

01:05:33.134 --> 01:05:34.468
No.

01:05:38.105 --> 01:05:40.309
Come on. Four, five, six.

01:05:40.441 --> 01:05:42.510
Don't quit on me, Daddy,
come on!

01:05:42.643 --> 01:05:46.848
One, two, three, four.

01:05:48.382 --> 01:05:50.718
No, no, no!

01:05:53.322 --> 01:05:55.089
Come on, Daddy, wake up!

01:05:56.891 --> 01:05:59.293
Come on!

01:06:02.129 --> 01:06:04.966
Yes, Daddy, yes! Yes!

01:06:07.435 --> 01:06:10.104
Yes, yes, yes!

01:06:12.740 --> 01:06:14.942
- You're okay. You're okay.
- Oh, God.

01:06:28.222 --> 01:06:29.423
Hey, Sugar.

01:06:30.224 --> 01:06:33.160
Okay, Sugar. It's okay.

01:06:34.462 --> 01:06:37.965
Come on. Let's get to the car.

01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:48.109
Oh, shit.

01:06:49.277 --> 01:06:50.511
No way!

01:06:55.116 --> 01:06:56.751
Dad, what do we do?

01:07:03.524 --> 01:07:05.459
Boat! You see over there?

01:07:05.593 --> 01:07:08.796
No, there are too many of 'em.
We need to stay here.

01:07:09.497 --> 01:07:10.665
No, those levees
are gonna break,

01:07:10.798 --> 01:07:13.034
and when they do
we can't be here.

01:07:13.167 --> 01:07:15.536
That boat's
our only chance to leave.

01:07:15.670 --> 01:07:17.538
I think we can make it.

01:07:18.639 --> 01:07:20.107
It's impossible.

01:07:22.043 --> 01:07:25.212
They gather in the floodwaters
'cause it's easier to hunt.

01:07:25.347 --> 01:07:27.349
They hunt what splashes.

01:07:27.481 --> 01:07:30.952
So no splashing, no hunting.

01:07:32.687 --> 01:07:34.789
I think
the rain should cover us.

01:07:34.922 --> 01:07:35.957
Okay.

01:07:38.427 --> 01:07:39.927
Come on, girl.

01:07:41.363 --> 01:07:43.998
It's okay. All right.

01:08:52.367 --> 01:08:54.001
The eye is above us.

01:09:04.545 --> 01:09:06.180
We'd better hurry.

01:09:07.548 --> 01:09:08.983
Ohh.

01:09:11.085 --> 01:09:12.653
Don't move.

01:09:29.203 --> 01:09:30.703
Levees just broke!

01:09:31.305 --> 01:09:33.774
Haley, you need to swim.

01:09:35.176 --> 01:09:38.513
You got this!
You're faster than they are!

01:09:38.645 --> 01:09:40.348
What are you?

01:09:41.182 --> 01:09:42.317
Swim!

01:10:16.217 --> 01:10:17.618
Whoo!

01:10:19.053 --> 01:10:21.155
Apex predator all day!

01:10:30.365 --> 01:10:31.399
Come on!

01:10:42.009 --> 01:10:43.677
- Hold on!
- Get down!

01:11:11.839 --> 01:11:14.008
- Dad! Dad!
- Take my hand!

01:11:16.344 --> 01:11:17.978
Help!

01:11:20.515 --> 01:11:22.216
- Haley!
- No! No!

01:11:52.813 --> 01:11:54.848
You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

01:12:00.689 --> 01:12:02.923
Dad! Where are you?

01:12:03.924 --> 01:12:05.159
Haley!

01:12:05.826 --> 01:12:07.495
I'm here!

01:12:09.296 --> 01:12:10.465
Oh.

01:12:43.465 --> 01:12:44.898
Hey!

01:12:45.533 --> 01:12:47.335
Meet me at the stairs.

01:13:19.401 --> 01:13:21.168
Oh! Ohh!

01:14:49.923 --> 01:14:52.926
Hello? Hello.
Can anybody hear me?

01:14:54.596 --> 01:14:57.097
Yes! Yes, hello!

01:14:57.231 --> 01:15:00.200
I'm trapped with my father
in our house in Coral Lake.

01:15:00.635 --> 01:15:02.102
It's flooded.

01:15:02.236 --> 01:15:04.439
There's alligators everywhere.

01:15:04.873 --> 01:15:06.341
Please send help.

01:15:06.940 --> 01:15:08.810
Please, can you hear me?

01:15:10.712 --> 01:15:12.212
No, come on!

01:15:35.870 --> 01:15:37.104
Sugar?

01:15:40.842 --> 01:15:43.243
Come on. Come here, girl.

01:15:44.479 --> 01:15:45.513
Come on.

01:15:51.185 --> 01:15:52.953
Good girl.

01:15:53.954 --> 01:15:55.557
Good girl.

01:15:57.358 --> 01:15:58.326
Haley!

01:16:10.705 --> 01:16:11.739
Dad!

01:16:13.441 --> 01:16:14.476
Dad!

01:16:25.687 --> 01:16:26.788
Dad!

01:16:26.921 --> 01:16:29.122
- Dad!
- Go!

01:16:29.524 --> 01:16:30.592
Go!

01:16:35.996 --> 01:16:37.565
Swim!

01:17:35.957 --> 01:17:37.525
Come on, you son of a bitch!

01:17:55.543 --> 01:17:58.313
Come on, we gotta
get to the roof. Come on.

01:18:00.715 --> 01:18:02.115
Come on, we gotta go.

01:18:02.884 --> 01:18:04.686
Keep the pressure on your arm.

01:18:05.753 --> 01:18:07.087
Stay with me!

01:18:19.099 --> 01:18:22.770
- The house made it after all.
- Yeah, she's a strong one.

01:18:22.904 --> 01:18:24.137
Come on.

01:18:26.975 --> 01:18:29.344
I lied to you
about the deal.

01:18:31.312 --> 01:18:33.280
I just couldn't sign the papers.

01:18:33.414 --> 01:18:36.116
- I don't want to sell.
- It doesn't matter, Dad.

01:18:36.249 --> 01:18:40.088
- It's just a house.
- It's not just a house. It's our home.

01:18:40.220 --> 01:18:42.557
The last place we were a family.

01:18:42.690 --> 01:18:44.459
This house isn't our home.

01:18:44.993 --> 01:18:47.762
Me and you, that's home.

01:18:47.895 --> 01:18:50.398
- Come on. You okay?
- Yeah.

01:18:52.533 --> 01:18:54.402
- Did you see that?
- What?

01:18:55.003 --> 01:18:56.738
It's the rescue helicopter.

01:18:56.871 --> 01:18:58.306
All right, go. Hurry!

01:19:03.243 --> 01:19:05.847
Here! We're here!

01:19:05.980 --> 01:19:07.214
Help!

01:19:08.383 --> 01:19:09.651
Do they see it?

01:19:10.217 --> 01:19:11.452
Come on!

01:19:18.291 --> 01:19:19.594
Haley!

01:19:23.998 --> 01:19:25.066
You okay?

01:19:25.566 --> 01:19:27.301
Dad, get to the roof!

01:19:27.935 --> 01:19:29.771
- Okay.
- I see a way out!

01:20:53.721 --> 01:20:54.756
Ah!

01:20:59.961 --> 01:21:01.362
Ah!

01:21:17.011 --> 01:21:18.045
Ahh!

01:22:09.263 --> 01:22:10.531
Wha...

01:25:17.383 --> 01:25:22.383
