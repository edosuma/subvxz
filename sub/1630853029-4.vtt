09:56.648 --> 09:57.736
He's that hard up?

09:57.780 --> 09:59.259
The guy
probably makes 250 a year.

09:59.303 --> 10:00.347
- Maybe.

10:00.391 --> 10:02.132
But according
to Financial Crimes,

10:02.175 --> 10:05.091
He was flat broke,
practically no savings,

10:05.135 --> 10:07.659
and that was after taking
a second mortgage last year.

10:07.703 --> 10:09.879
- Three credit cards
all maxed out.

10:09.922 --> 10:11.663
The guy was drowning in debt.

10:11.707 --> 10:13.622
His tab was close
to $1 million.

10:13.665 --> 10:15.406
- Any idea
where that money went?

10:15.449 --> 10:18.104
Was he living a big life?
- Doesn't look that way.

10:18.148 --> 10:19.671
His apartment was nice,
but nothing special.

10:19.715 --> 10:20.933
- Mm-hmm.

10:20.977 --> 10:22.761
- So much
for living a big life.

10:22.805 --> 10:25.068
But that money
just doesn't disappear.

10:25.111 --> 10:27.418
So let's find out
where it went.

10:27.461 --> 10:29.550
- Okay.

10:29.594 --> 10:31.944
- So this judge had
a serious gambling problem--

10:31.988 --> 10:33.642
had an account on First Down.

10:33.685 --> 10:34.947
- I'm familiar.

10:34.991 --> 10:36.601
- Well, I hope your touch
was better than his.

10:36.645 --> 10:39.560
This guy was down about 200K,
shut him off three months ago.

10:39.604 --> 10:43.129
- Yeah, better to put your
money in a paper shredder.

10:43.173 --> 10:45.610
- Looks like he was doing a lot
of betting with a bookie too.

10:45.654 --> 10:47.177
- You got a name?

10:47.220 --> 10:50.136
- No--lots of text messages
going back and forth, though.

10:50.180 --> 10:52.225
A few of them
are from a Dr. Weisman.

10:52.269 --> 10:54.401
Owed him a lot of money--
about 100 grand.

10:54.445 --> 10:57.100
- Two days ago,
he sends a text to the judge.

10:57.143 --> 11:01.974
"Need to get paid by tomorrow,
or this ain't gonna end well."

11:07.371 --> 11:07.588

No question about it.

11:16.119 --> 11:18.077
- You also threatened the guy.

11:18.121 --> 11:20.732
Mm-hmm.

11:20.776 --> 11:25.781
"Need to get paid by tomorrow,
or this ain't gonna end well."

11:25.824 --> 11:27.434
- That was a text.

11:27.478 --> 11:29.523
- Don't you see
it didn't end well?

11:29.567 --> 11:31.134
In fact, it ended really badly.

11:31.177 --> 11:34.746
The guy got his head smashed in
with a fire extinguisher.

11:34.790 --> 11:36.574
So it wasn't just a text.

11:36.617 --> 11:38.271
- No.

11:38.315 --> 11:40.796
Never got physical
with the judge.

11:40.839 --> 11:41.797
Ever.

- What is this, uh,
Dr. Weisman crap?

11:46.671 --> 11:49.239
- Excuse me?
- You sent a text to the judge.

11:49.282 --> 11:51.197
You signed it "Dr. Weisman."

11:51.241 --> 11:53.983
- I went to dental school
for two months and dropped out.

11:54.026 --> 11:55.201
The name stuck.

11:55.245 --> 11:58.117
Look, you guys
are way off base here.

11:58.161 --> 11:59.945
I didn't have
a beef with Keating.

11:59.989 --> 12:01.338
He paid me in full.

12:01.381 --> 12:02.339
- We've seen his bank accounts.

12:02.382 --> 12:03.644
He didn't have
a pot to piss in.

12:03.688 --> 12:05.429
How does he suddenly come up
with 100 grand?

12:05.472 --> 12:07.170
- I don't know
what to tell you.

12:07.213 --> 12:08.911
He said he had the money
and told me to come down

12:08.954 --> 12:10.782

12:25.144 --> 12:26.493

No discernable prints,
but they recovered a hair.

Well, that eliminates Weisman.

to marry her boyfriend.

31:08.745 --> 31:10.181

didn't want it to happen.
