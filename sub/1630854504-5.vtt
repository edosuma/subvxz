WEBVTT

00:25.853 --> 00:27.682
It's gonna be strange,

00:27.682 --> 00:30.616
Charlie being so far
away from home.

00:30.616 --> 00:32.825
Trust me,
two months with his dad

00:32.825 --> 00:34.413
will be enough for Charlie.

00:36.450 --> 00:38.107
And what about Ruby?

00:38.107 --> 00:40.626
Ah, well, apparently they're
gonna stay together,

00:40.626 --> 00:43.146
but they're gonna be open
to seeing other people.

00:43.146 --> 00:46.736
Oh, very bohemian!
I approve.

00:52.155 --> 00:55.745
But what if he meets
another girl, he falls in love,

00:55.745 --> 00:58.610
and then
he wants to stay there?

00:58.610 --> 01:00.336
Then we'll visit.

01:04.581 --> 01:06.825
Don't they have bears in Canada?

01:06.825 --> 01:08.689
Not in Toronto, Mum.

01:08.689 --> 01:11.657
When you're running away,
you have to zig-zag.

01:11.657 --> 01:13.245
It confuses them.

01:13.245 --> 01:15.523
No, that's crocodiles.

01:15.523 --> 01:18.008
With bears, I think you're meant
to make yourself really big

01:18.008 --> 01:19.803
and wave your arms around
and shout.

01:19.803 --> 01:21.253
Oh, right.
Well, while you're doing that,

01:21.253 --> 01:22.772
I'll be running away.

01:26.155 --> 01:29.779
You know this is what separates
us from the DFLs, don't you?

01:29.779 --> 01:32.954
What, practical footwear?

01:32.954 --> 01:35.129
Some of them have been
living down here for years,

01:35.129 --> 01:36.544
and they still run into the sea

01:36.544 --> 01:39.685
like they're treading
on hot coals.

01:39.685 --> 01:43.517
Don't worry, he'll be
back in no time.

01:46.002 --> 01:49.385
Come on, I'll get the kettle on.

01:49.971 --> 01:52.664
Oh, you've finally mowed
the lawn!

01:52.664 --> 01:54.286
Oh, yeah, yeah.

02:05.401 --> 02:07.023
What's that noise?

02:11.234 --> 02:13.305
Is that the shower?

02:17.206 --> 02:18.828
Mum!

02:18.828 --> 02:21.555
What are you playing at?!

02:21.555 --> 02:23.453
Scatterbrain.

02:23.453 --> 02:25.214
I've lost the plot.

02:25.214 --> 02:27.250
You better book me on
the next flight to Switzerland.

02:27.250 --> 02:28.769
Oh, Switzerland's a bit far.

02:28.769 --> 02:30.667
Be cheaper to chuck you
under a bus.

02:30.667 --> 02:32.221
No more Bloody Marys

02:32.221 --> 02:34.223
for breakfast!

03:39.805 --> 03:41.462
Morning?

04:18.292 --> 04:21.537
Oh, no. Oh, Dawnie!
Dawnie, Dawnie.

04:21.537 --> 04:24.125
Oh, my darling, you're hurt.

04:24.125 --> 04:25.644
Oh, I'm so sorry.

04:25.644 --> 04:26.852
Don't worry, I've got you,
I've got you.

04:26.852 --> 04:29.545
Oh, it's okay. Oh, my darling!

04:29.545 --> 04:32.099
You're okay now. You're okay.

04:39.106 --> 04:40.556
I usually lock up.

04:40.556 --> 04:41.902
Dawn goes home and makes
the dinner

04:41.902 --> 04:44.180
while I dot the I's
and cross the T's.

04:44.180 --> 04:45.388
Any normal night,
it would've been me.

04:45.388 --> 04:47.148
Oh, I'm glad it was me.

04:47.148 --> 04:50.151
He's got a weak heart.
This would've finished him.

04:50.151 --> 04:51.705
Why didn't you lock up?

04:51.705 --> 04:52.740
I was away with friends.

04:52.740 --> 04:54.570
On a treasure hunt.

04:54.570 --> 04:56.675
A forensic search
of the Kent coastline.

04:56.675 --> 05:00.161
Saddos with metal detectors.

05:00.161 --> 05:02.336
Centuries of shipwrecks,
you know?

05:02.336 --> 05:04.338
Gold coins, silver ingots.

05:04.338 --> 05:06.340
Then there's the ambergris.

05:06.340 --> 05:07.376
Ambergris?

05:07.376 --> 05:08.894
Whale vomit.

05:08.894 --> 05:10.517
- Oh.
- Washed up and hardened.

05:10.517 --> 05:13.071
It's a rare, but vital
ingredient in perfume.

05:13.071 --> 05:14.417
It's worth a small fortune.

05:14.417 --> 05:15.970
There was a month's
takings in the safe.

05:15.970 --> 05:17.593
More if you include the till.

05:17.593 --> 05:21.528
I mean, it wasn't a fortune,
but it was all we had.

05:21.528 --> 05:23.461
You got to find who did this.

05:23.461 --> 05:26.222
I don't care how you do it
or what rules you have to bend,

05:26.222 --> 05:29.363
I want you to break
their fingers one by one.

05:37.406 --> 05:38.959
Something's not right.

05:38.959 --> 05:40.754
What, the husband?

05:40.754 --> 05:42.411
Well, let's see
if his alibi checks out.

05:42.411 --> 05:44.413
No, I mean something's not right
'cause this is normally

05:44.413 --> 05:46.863
when Pearl rocks up to give us
all the local knowledge.

05:46.863 --> 05:48.969
I might as well call her.
Get the inside track.

05:48.969 --> 05:51.972
Put the phone down.

05:51.972 --> 05:54.630
We're solving this one
on our own.

06:53.205 --> 06:55.449
If they're not coming
we're gonna need a new name.

06:55.449 --> 06:57.002
Mm.

06:57.002 --> 06:59.246
Quizzly Bears.
One for Charlie.

06:59.246 --> 07:01.904
No bears in Toronto.

07:01.904 --> 07:02.939
I'm Smarticus?

07:02.939 --> 07:04.078
No. I'm Smarticus.

07:04.078 --> 07:05.977
Ah, I could text Kat.

07:05.977 --> 07:07.288
Oh, don't bother.

07:07.288 --> 07:08.600
They're probably having
a night in.

07:08.600 --> 07:10.050
Couscous and Rightmove.

07:10.050 --> 07:11.845
Searching for their
"forever home."

07:11.845 --> 07:13.847
Leave it.

07:13.847 --> 07:15.504
Be more fun just us two anyway.

07:15.504 --> 07:17.229
I'm game.

09:02.231 --> 09:05.579
Tupac?
As in Shakur?

09:05.579 --> 09:07.857
Working in the Aldi
in Herne bay?

09:07.857 --> 09:10.757
Yeah. I mean, it is
an amazing story.

09:10.757 --> 09:12.344
But, um...

09:12.344 --> 09:14.174
I don't think
I'll take that case.

09:14.174 --> 09:16.038
Thanks, bye.

09:16.038 --> 09:17.487
Blimey.

09:17.487 --> 09:18.661
You haven't got any
dead celebrities

09:18.661 --> 09:20.490
you want me
to track down, have you?

09:20.490 --> 09:22.803
Marilyn Monroe's not living it
up in a care home in Maidstone?

09:22.803 --> 09:24.771
No.

09:24.771 --> 09:26.393
But...

09:28.360 --> 09:29.741
...I do want to hire you.

09:29.741 --> 09:31.398
As a detective.

09:31.398 --> 09:34.608
- Okay.
- I think I'm being robbed.

09:34.608 --> 09:36.852
Things keep going missing
at home.

09:36.852 --> 09:39.371
Food from the fridge,
stuff that I know I bought.

09:39.371 --> 09:43.824
And I know that I took a tenner
out of the cashpoint especially.

09:43.824 --> 09:45.792
And when I opened my purse,
it wasn't there.

09:45.792 --> 09:47.172
Why would someone want to break
into your house

09:47.172 --> 09:49.105
to nick a tenner
or food out of your fridge?

09:49.105 --> 09:51.383
Let me finish.

09:51.383 --> 09:53.040
You know the other day
when we came home.

09:53.040 --> 09:54.386
When you left the shower on?

09:54.386 --> 09:55.664
Yeah, but I didn't,
I know I didn't!

09:55.664 --> 09:57.389
I'm sure of it.

09:57.389 --> 10:00.116
And someone mowed the lawn,
because I didn't do that either.

10:00.116 --> 10:05.915
And this morning, I was asleep,
and the smoke alarm went off.

10:05.915 --> 10:08.055
And there was toast
burning in the kitchen.

10:10.368 --> 10:12.059
It's an oddball burglar.

10:12.059 --> 10:14.924
And I am hiring you
to find them.

10:14.924 --> 10:16.926
You honestly think someone's
breaking into your house

10:16.926 --> 10:18.687
to make toast
and mow the lawn?

10:18.687 --> 10:22.000
I know it sounds crazy,
but it's the only explanation.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.831
It's not the only explanation.

10:27.385 --> 10:29.490
Have you seen a doctor?

10:31.665 --> 10:33.218
Listen, Pearl.

10:33.218 --> 10:36.118
You're a detective,
you're not a brain surgeon.

10:36.118 --> 10:38.879
And I am not hiring you
to give me medical advice.

10:38.879 --> 10:41.123
I just want this burglar caught.

10:41.123 --> 10:42.745
Okay.

10:47.025 --> 10:49.821
I went on a date the other day.

10:49.821 --> 10:51.133
It was nice.

10:51.133 --> 10:52.410
We met online.

10:52.410 --> 10:54.550
Um...

10:54.550 --> 10:57.933
We like the same things.

10:57.933 --> 11:01.074
We agreed to take it slow.

11:01.074 --> 11:04.905
Um, when I got back, I wanted
to tell somebody all about it.

11:04.905 --> 11:09.254
So I picked up the phone,
and I called my wife.

11:09.254 --> 11:11.532
She didn't answer obviously.

11:13.811 --> 11:18.850
I called my wife to tell her
I'd been on a date.

11:21.750 --> 11:23.993
And I don't know
how to make sense of that.

11:30.103 --> 11:32.726
I used to march against things
like this.

11:32.726 --> 11:34.763
My house is
a surveillance state.

11:34.763 --> 11:37.386
Do you want to catch
this weirdo or not?

11:37.386 --> 11:41.148
These cameras, they're linked
to your laptop?

11:41.148 --> 11:42.909
So you can spy on me?

11:42.909 --> 11:43.875
Hypothetically.

11:43.875 --> 11:45.152
- But you won't.
- No.

11:45.152 --> 11:46.982
Because you respect my privacy.

11:46.982 --> 11:49.432
Because I've got
better things to do.

11:51.469 --> 11:55.093
You think I'm going loopy.

11:55.093 --> 11:56.888
Let's give it a few days.

11:56.888 --> 11:59.615
A week.
See what we find.

13:27.427 --> 13:30.119
We tracked him from
the back of your shop.

13:30.119 --> 13:32.466
Then he turns down a side street
and disappears from view.

13:32.466 --> 13:34.641
Do you recognize him?

13:34.641 --> 13:37.023
He could be a customer?
A regular?

13:37.023 --> 13:39.473
Or someone who came in
for the first time recently?

13:39.473 --> 13:41.855
No, it all happened so fast.

13:41.855 --> 13:45.065
But he's the person
that robbed me.

13:45.065 --> 13:48.137
I can't tell you any more.

13:48.137 --> 13:50.277
- You sure?
- Yes.

13:50.277 --> 13:53.280
I saw you're closing the shop.

13:53.280 --> 13:55.006
I can't go back in there.

13:55.006 --> 13:56.628
Not now.

13:58.665 --> 14:01.944
My parents ran it before us.

14:01.944 --> 14:04.671
As a newsagents.

14:04.671 --> 14:06.638
It was his idea to change it.

14:06.638 --> 14:08.468
I was future proofing.

14:08.468 --> 14:10.159
Well no one wants newspapers
any more.

14:10.159 --> 14:13.887
No one wants
ancient crap either.

14:13.887 --> 14:15.647
You were losing money?

14:15.647 --> 14:17.339
We speculate to accumulate.

14:17.339 --> 14:19.755
He's a dreamer.
Head in the clouds.

14:19.755 --> 14:21.446
She's still in shock.

14:21.446 --> 14:25.243
Yeah, but he feels guilty.
So he's finally listening to me.

14:31.111 --> 14:32.457
Stop smiling!

14:32.457 --> 14:34.114
They've got really
strict security.

14:34.114 --> 14:36.082
It's Canada, not North Korea.

14:36.082 --> 14:38.912
They waterboard you if they
think you're taking the piss.

14:45.470 --> 14:47.817
Have you noticed anything
different about Dolly?

14:47.817 --> 14:49.578
Well, she was nice
to Tom the other day.

14:49.578 --> 14:52.132
So that was a bit weird.

14:52.132 --> 14:53.823
I don't know.

14:53.823 --> 14:57.482
I think she's really
struggling at home on her own.

14:57.482 --> 14:59.001
She left the shower
on all day.

14:59.001 --> 15:02.280
And she swears she doesn't
remember doing it, but...

15:02.280 --> 15:04.386
I'm worried about her.

15:04.386 --> 15:06.008
I might ask her to move in.

15:06.008 --> 15:07.768
Look, is this your way of trying
to guilt trip me

15:07.768 --> 15:09.322
into making sure
that I come home?

15:09.322 --> 15:11.980
No, it's my way of telling you
that I'm gonna offer

15:11.980 --> 15:13.602
Dolly your room.

15:17.295 --> 15:19.539
Anyway, you are
coming back home.

15:19.539 --> 15:21.817
Yeah, yeah, I know. University.

15:21.817 --> 15:25.303
No. They won't let you
in the country with those.

15:27.581 --> 15:30.136
You idiot.

15:30.136 --> 15:31.965
Alright, come on.
Let's get some together.

15:31.965 --> 15:33.208
Oh, no, Charlie.

15:33.208 --> 15:35.969
Oh, come on.
Don't be such a sour puss.

15:35.969 --> 15:37.350
Come on then.

15:41.181 --> 15:42.803
I'm really gonna miss you, mate.

15:42.803 --> 15:44.667
Yeah, you too.

15:54.815 --> 15:57.991
What we got?

15:57.991 --> 16:01.063
Our burglar.
Carl "Cheese" Crow.

16:01.063 --> 16:02.133
Cheese?

16:02.133 --> 16:03.341
Yeah, he's a deejay.

16:03.341 --> 16:04.998
Local cheese nights.

16:04.998 --> 16:06.896
Plays "The One and Only"
on loop.

16:06.896 --> 16:08.553
We could arrest him
just for that.

16:08.553 --> 16:10.038
How'd you find him?

16:10.038 --> 16:12.074
Pearl.

16:12.074 --> 16:13.593
I got you.

16:13.593 --> 16:16.354
It was actually all my own
police work, thanks.

16:16.354 --> 16:19.564
Carl's got a record.
Breaking and entering.

16:19.564 --> 16:22.257
He's also got a website.

16:22.257 --> 16:24.466
Recognize the logo?

16:25.812 --> 16:27.020
Alright.

16:27.020 --> 16:29.160
And guess who his aunt is.

16:29.160 --> 16:30.782
It's Dawn.

16:32.819 --> 16:35.373
You reckon she still wants us
to break his fingers?

16:53.874 --> 16:56.049
- Thank you, thank you. Bye.
- Cheers, bye.

17:14.826 --> 17:16.276
Dawn must have recognized him.

17:16.276 --> 17:18.278
She's covering for him.

17:18.278 --> 17:20.936
Or she's in on it.
Insurance job.

17:20.936 --> 17:22.731
Yeah, well, the shop
was losing money.

17:22.731 --> 17:24.146
They could have faked
the robbery

17:24.146 --> 17:25.941
while Ian was away
hunting for whale puke.

17:25.941 --> 17:27.667
Bit weird the way they
were talking to each other,

17:27.667 --> 17:29.496
don't you think?

17:29.496 --> 17:31.636
Or maybe that's how you make
a relationship work these days?

17:31.636 --> 17:32.879
Yeah, whatever it takes.

17:32.879 --> 17:34.294
My girlfriend's a duvet hog.

17:34.294 --> 17:36.848
Therefore, I buy her
her own duvet.

17:36.848 --> 17:39.334
Girlfriend?

17:39.334 --> 17:40.369
Yeah.

17:40.369 --> 17:41.543
Oh.

17:41.543 --> 17:43.234
Oh, this is priceless.

17:43.234 --> 17:46.237
You didn't know?

17:46.237 --> 17:48.722
How long have we been
working together?

17:48.722 --> 17:51.656
Of course I knew.

17:51.656 --> 17:53.244
Got ya.

17:53.244 --> 17:55.833
That's not funny.

17:55.833 --> 17:57.110
Let's play this one smart.

17:57.110 --> 17:59.147
See if we can get
Cheese to talk.

17:59.147 --> 18:01.080
Oh, so you're saying
I can break his fingers?

18:01.080 --> 18:03.289
Well, let's start
with the charm offensive.

18:03.289 --> 18:06.188
Oh, that'll be on me then.

18:06.188 --> 18:07.810
I can be respectful.

18:17.303 --> 18:18.545
Carl Crow?

18:18.545 --> 18:19.926
- Yeah.
- We'd like a word.

18:19.926 --> 18:21.548
Can we come in?

18:22.756 --> 18:24.379
Aah!

18:27.485 --> 18:29.004
Carl, no!

18:35.459 --> 18:37.806
Get off!

18:37.806 --> 18:40.153
- Stay still.
- Get off me!

18:40.153 --> 18:42.604
Very respectful.

18:44.399 --> 18:46.159
Okay.

18:48.334 --> 18:50.059
Are you ready?

18:56.307 --> 18:58.033
You're talking to yourself.

18:58.033 --> 19:02.175
Well, you do that when you live
alone. You'll find out.

19:02.175 --> 19:04.902
Oh, you can fast forward
this bit.

19:04.902 --> 19:06.973
Mum! You're smoking!

19:06.973 --> 19:08.940
You gave up.

19:08.940 --> 19:10.839
We sponsored you for charity!

19:10.839 --> 19:12.565
"You sponsored me for charity"

19:12.565 --> 19:13.945
Uh, stop, stop.

19:16.189 --> 19:18.467
Who's that?

19:18.467 --> 19:20.089
Oh, my God.

19:27.200 --> 19:29.202
Well, who is he?

19:29.202 --> 19:30.652
- I don't know.
- Mum!

19:30.652 --> 19:33.033
Mum, there's a stranger
living in your garage

19:33.033 --> 19:36.105
stealing your stuff.

19:36.796 --> 19:39.247
Do you think
he's in there now?

19:39.247 --> 19:41.870
Probably.

19:41.870 --> 19:43.492
Yeah.

19:49.084 --> 19:51.224
Hello!
Why aren't you freaking out?

19:51.224 --> 19:53.226
Oh, I thought I was
losing my mind.

19:53.226 --> 19:55.504
Honestly, I feel like
punching the air.

19:55.504 --> 19:56.816
I think you are
losing your mind.

19:56.816 --> 19:59.025
No. I'm not,
because now finally,

19:59.025 --> 20:00.302
everything makes sense.

20:00.302 --> 20:01.269
I'm calling the police.

20:01.269 --> 20:03.063
- No, wait.
- Mum.

20:03.063 --> 20:04.789
He could've murdered you
in your sleep.

20:04.789 --> 20:07.240
But he didn't!

20:07.240 --> 20:10.105
Look, look.
Come and look at this.

20:15.248 --> 20:16.905
What's he doing?

20:16.905 --> 20:20.253
Well, I think
he's paying me back.

20:20.253 --> 20:22.255
He's replacing
everything he took.

20:22.255 --> 20:23.394
I'm still
gonna call the police.

20:23.394 --> 20:24.913
No.

20:24.913 --> 20:27.640
Put the knife down.

20:27.640 --> 20:29.262
And the phone.

20:32.852 --> 20:35.682
Mum.

20:35.682 --> 20:37.477
What are you doing?

20:39.859 --> 20:42.068
I'm gonna make him a cup of tea.

21:12.167 --> 21:14.203
We come in peace.

21:16.447 --> 21:19.174
I'm Dolly,
and this is my daughter Pearl.

21:25.870 --> 21:27.458
I'm Bill.

21:30.047 --> 21:31.876
Why don't we all go inside?

21:52.000 --> 21:53.622
I'm so sorry.

21:56.694 --> 22:00.180
I've had a few problems lately.

22:00.180 --> 22:01.872
I lost my job.

22:01.872 --> 22:04.392
I just started to drink
too much.

22:04.392 --> 22:06.566
Well, you took a bottle
of whiskey off my Mum.

22:06.566 --> 22:08.637
I didn't touch a drop though.

22:08.637 --> 22:10.225
I was tempted.

22:10.225 --> 22:12.123
You took other stuff.
We've got it all on camera.

22:12.123 --> 22:14.367
Yeah, but then you--
you put everything back.

22:14.367 --> 22:15.920
Like the money, the food.

22:15.920 --> 22:17.543
You really scared her.

22:21.374 --> 22:23.445
I'm sorry.

22:23.445 --> 22:26.517
Like I say, I was in a bad way.

22:26.517 --> 22:30.003
Some mental health issues and...

22:30.003 --> 22:32.109
But I've got a job now.

22:32.109 --> 22:33.835
Fruit picking.

22:33.835 --> 22:37.183
It's not much, but the first
wage packet I got,

22:37.183 --> 22:38.736
I paid you back every penny.

22:38.736 --> 22:40.669
I know that's no excuse.

22:40.669 --> 22:43.189
Why me? Why my garage?

22:43.189 --> 22:44.846
Well, I was dossing up
on the high street

22:44.846 --> 22:46.434
in a shop doorway.

22:46.434 --> 22:49.954
And then they put all these
metal studs down outside.

22:49.954 --> 22:52.612
Oh, the spikes.

22:52.612 --> 22:55.408
It's not really conducive
to a good night's kip.

22:55.408 --> 22:58.515
Makes my blood boil.

22:59.067 --> 23:01.276
So like I say,
it was a cold night.

23:01.276 --> 23:03.554
I saw the garage and...

23:03.554 --> 23:07.420
I just needed to get out
of the cold and the wind.

23:07.420 --> 23:08.973
I didn't plan on staying.

23:08.973 --> 23:10.458
And there's no one else
you can stay with?

23:10.458 --> 23:12.598
No friends or family?

23:13.806 --> 23:15.463
Not anymore, no.

23:15.463 --> 23:19.432
Well, you can't carry on
sleeping in my garden.

23:19.432 --> 23:21.572
I know.

23:21.572 --> 23:22.780
Look, I'll get going.

23:22.780 --> 23:24.748
Why don't you stay
in my spare room?

23:24.748 --> 23:26.819
Mum!

23:26.819 --> 23:28.786
Just for tonight.

23:38.140 --> 23:39.694
I'm gonna stay here tonight.

23:39.694 --> 23:41.696
No, don't be silly.
Go home.

23:41.696 --> 23:44.250
I'm not gonna leave you
with a total stranger.

23:44.250 --> 23:46.286
Pearl, I'm fine.

23:47.702 --> 23:49.255
Right, well leave
all the cameras on.

23:49.255 --> 23:50.670
And go to bed
with your pepper spray.

23:50.670 --> 23:52.500
And that knife.

23:52.500 --> 23:55.261
All this detective work
has made you cynical.

23:55.261 --> 23:57.159
We've got no idea who he is!

23:57.159 --> 24:00.508
He's got kind eyes
and a nice smile.

24:00.508 --> 24:02.475
And anyway, don't you think
it's a bit of a mystery

24:02.475 --> 24:03.683
how he ended up here?

24:03.683 --> 24:06.099
Surely you'd like to solve that.

24:06.099 --> 24:07.722
Don't you think it's a bit weird

24:07.722 --> 24:10.759
that he hasn't got any friends
or family at all?

24:10.759 --> 24:12.209
I think we should call
the police.

24:12.209 --> 24:15.281
Pearl, go home.

24:16.351 --> 24:19.112
- This is rude.
- Just go!

25:27.284 --> 25:29.355
It's cold in Canada.

25:32.047 --> 25:33.739
And what's so good about skiing?

25:33.739 --> 25:36.396
It's just rich kids
falling down a hill.

25:36.396 --> 25:38.571
Gravity does most of the work,
doesn't it?

25:46.855 --> 25:48.201
Here he comes.

25:49.582 --> 25:52.033
He hasn't killed her at least.

26:30.761 --> 26:32.280
Right, you're going traveling,

26:32.280 --> 26:33.833
and you want to earn
a bit of extra money, okay?

26:33.833 --> 26:35.455
That's your cover story.

26:38.631 --> 26:40.253
And what, follow him?

26:40.253 --> 26:42.635
Try and work with him.
Get talking.

26:42.635 --> 26:45.086
See if he's telling the truth.

26:45.086 --> 26:48.330
I'm like a spy
or a secret agent.

26:48.330 --> 26:51.126
Yeah, well, you're a waitress
pretending to be

26:51.126 --> 26:53.094
a fruit picker following
a homeless bloke, so...

26:53.094 --> 26:55.303
Go on.

26:55.303 --> 26:57.201
- See you.
- See you later.

27:16.151 --> 27:17.877
Can we have a word?

27:24.470 --> 27:25.816
You must have
known it was Carl.

27:25.816 --> 27:28.267
I told you.
Everything happened so fast.

27:28.267 --> 27:29.682
I didn't have time to think.

27:29.682 --> 27:32.133
What about the CCTV, hm?

27:32.133 --> 27:34.687
The logo. Cheese.

27:34.687 --> 27:35.757
You can't miss it.

27:35.757 --> 27:36.862
Idiot.

27:36.862 --> 27:38.277
Why were you covering for him?

27:38.277 --> 27:40.279
What, covering for Carl?

27:40.279 --> 27:41.832
No, no, no, no.

27:41.832 --> 27:43.696
The shop was losing money.

27:43.696 --> 27:45.733
You knew the insurance
would pay out.

27:45.733 --> 27:48.597
You staged the robbery.
You and Carl.

27:48.597 --> 27:51.600
Carl hasn't got the brains
he was born with.

27:54.293 --> 27:57.503
Look, I'm tired.
Don't make me say it.

28:00.748 --> 28:02.784
You weren't covering for Carl.

28:04.855 --> 28:06.892
You were covering for Ian.

28:11.862 --> 28:13.933
I stayed late.

28:13.933 --> 28:17.523
Just, I don't know, trying to
make sense of the accounts.

28:18.455 --> 28:21.285
Ian thought I'd be at home.

28:21.285 --> 28:23.425
And Carl took it too far.

28:24.875 --> 28:27.188
Does Ian know you know?

28:28.948 --> 28:31.468
Look, he's a good man.

28:31.468 --> 28:33.401
He'd never hurt me.

28:34.954 --> 28:38.786
But he's always looking
for an easy answer.

28:39.303 --> 28:42.755
Anybody else would have filed
for bankruptcy.

28:42.755 --> 28:45.620
He came up with this.

28:47.311 --> 28:48.934
He's a dreamer.

29:07.469 --> 29:10.024
Okay, I've got--
I know why you're here, okay?

29:10.024 --> 29:12.164
But just bear with me.

29:13.406 --> 29:16.030
A Spanish galleon, right,
the <i>Santa Maria,</i>

29:16.030 --> 29:19.067
sank off this stretch of coast
in the late 16th century.

29:19.067 --> 29:21.967
And the spoils were never found.

29:21.967 --> 29:25.418
We're talking jewels
and silver and gold,

29:25.418 --> 29:28.249
buried somewhere on this beach.

29:28.249 --> 29:31.355
It's a fortune.

29:31.355 --> 29:33.979
It could change
your life around.

29:35.187 --> 29:38.811
We could split it three ways.

29:41.400 --> 29:44.644
The lost treasure of
the <i>Santa Maria.</i>

30:09.980 --> 30:11.602
You're nicked, mate.

30:15.848 --> 30:17.470
Come on.

30:52.264 --> 30:56.130
I'm sunburnt, I've got
blisters on my hands,

30:56.130 --> 30:58.442
and I never want to see
another strawberry again.

30:58.442 --> 31:00.030
You are a trooper.

31:00.030 --> 31:01.411
What about Bill?

31:02.895 --> 31:05.277
He seems for real.
He works hard.

31:05.277 --> 31:08.245
Shared his lunch with one of
the lads that didn't have any.

31:10.109 --> 31:11.628
I like him.

31:11.628 --> 31:14.148
He's got a kind eyes.

31:14.148 --> 31:15.770
Great.

31:31.406 --> 31:32.614
What do you mean he's staying?

31:32.614 --> 31:34.823
It's just till
he finds his feet.

31:34.823 --> 31:37.550
Oh, I'm gonna get you
some of those spikes

31:37.550 --> 31:39.207
and put them by your front door.

31:39.207 --> 31:42.935
Look, Bill needs somewhere
to live, I like the company.

31:42.935 --> 31:44.695
It's win-win.

31:44.695 --> 31:47.146
One minute, he's stealing from
you, and now he's your roomie.

31:47.146 --> 31:48.699
I mean, don't you think
it's a bit fast, Mum?

31:48.699 --> 31:50.494
We're taking one day at a time.

31:50.494 --> 31:52.496
He could be using you.

31:52.496 --> 31:55.016
He's weeded both the gardens,
he's fixed the tiles

31:55.016 --> 31:57.156
on the roof,
he's even cleaned the oven.

31:57.156 --> 31:58.709
He's working like a dog.

31:58.709 --> 32:01.091
Hmm, but he's not paying
any rent, is he?

32:01.091 --> 32:03.300
You really are
Thatcher's daughter.

32:03.300 --> 32:06.096
Mum, taxi's here.

32:06.096 --> 32:07.718
Oh.

32:09.720 --> 32:11.964
Right, you call me
as soon as you land.

32:11.964 --> 32:13.621
I will, I will.

32:13.621 --> 32:15.968
And then call me again
when you get to your Dad's.

32:15.968 --> 32:17.418
- Yeah, okay.
- Bye, bye, darling.

32:17.418 --> 32:19.627
See you.

32:19.627 --> 32:21.525
- And if you see a bear...
- Zig-zags.

32:21.525 --> 32:23.493
Oh, no, wait, sorry.
Make myself big.

32:23.493 --> 32:24.770
Scream and shout.

32:24.770 --> 32:27.393
Oh, just leg it.
Let it eat your Dad.

32:29.982 --> 32:30.983
Let me help with your bags.

32:30.983 --> 32:33.468
Pearl, let, uh, Ruby do that.

32:33.468 --> 32:36.989
Oh, yeah, of course.

32:36.989 --> 32:38.853
I love you, Mum.

32:38.853 --> 32:40.475
I love you, too.

32:42.857 --> 32:45.446
- Have an amazing time.
- I will.

32:46.378 --> 32:48.000
You will look after her
when I'm gone, won't you?

32:48.000 --> 32:50.002
I will, I promise.

33:35.392 --> 33:36.531
What?

33:38.775 --> 33:43.055
Okay.

33:43.055 --> 33:44.850
Where are you?

33:44.850 --> 33:46.507
Right.

33:46.507 --> 33:49.061
I'm on my way.
I'm coming now.

33:52.340 --> 33:55.136
Mike? It's Pearl.

33:57.414 --> 33:59.071
Hey.

34:01.246 --> 34:02.902
What's going on?

34:05.077 --> 34:07.493
Mike?

34:07.493 --> 34:09.081
What's going on?

34:09.081 --> 34:11.428
Nothing, it's stupid.

34:13.430 --> 34:15.536
I broke a glass in the kitchen.

34:18.573 --> 34:20.334
I didn't know what to do.

34:22.094 --> 34:23.682
Okay.

34:25.822 --> 34:27.444
Maybe clean it up.

34:30.482 --> 34:32.898
Do you want me to do that?

34:35.176 --> 34:37.351
Can you get rid of it, please?

34:37.351 --> 34:39.180
Of course.

35:12.627 --> 35:14.974
What was that?
A panic attack?

35:16.493 --> 35:18.840
It's pathetic.

35:19.945 --> 35:23.051
Well...

35:23.051 --> 35:25.157
when you called,
I was spying on my mum.

35:25.157 --> 35:28.609
So, how's that for pathetic?

35:30.162 --> 35:33.165
I think she's got
a new boyfriend.

35:34.028 --> 35:35.650
It's a long story.

35:44.694 --> 35:46.316
That glass.

35:48.767 --> 35:52.633
It was a present from my wife
for my--

35:52.633 --> 35:54.945
for my 30th birthday.

35:55.946 --> 35:58.673
Hm.

35:58.673 --> 36:01.193
"Mike. Established 1982."

36:01.193 --> 36:03.609
Yeah.
She thought it was funny.

36:07.613 --> 36:09.891
She had a good sense of humor.

36:16.450 --> 36:18.210
I never used that glass.

36:22.766 --> 36:25.217
Just seeing it smashed
on the floor like that...

36:45.789 --> 36:47.826
Why did you call me?

36:50.691 --> 36:52.520
Why not Kat?

38:07.319 --> 38:09.321
Hey, are you all right?

38:09.321 --> 38:11.116
Anymore breakages?

38:11.116 --> 38:12.359
<i>Yeah, listen.</i>

38:12.359 --> 38:14.326
I've done some digging for you.

38:14.326 --> 38:15.983
Dolly's burglar
slash boyfriend.

38:15.983 --> 38:17.812
- Bill.
- His full name's

38:17.812 --> 38:19.193
Graham William Tait.

38:19.193 --> 38:21.885
<i>- Go on.</i>
- You ain't gonna like this.

38:29.755 --> 38:31.757
We need to talk.

38:33.414 --> 38:35.036
Mum...

38:37.142 --> 38:39.178
He's been in prison...

38:42.906 --> 38:44.770
...for murder.

38:47.117 --> 38:49.499
He killed his Dad.

38:49.499 --> 38:51.121
I know.

38:53.779 --> 38:55.367
What do you mean you know?

38:59.129 --> 39:00.752
Mum, you're scaring me.

39:00.752 --> 39:03.755
Pearl, please hear him out.

39:12.211 --> 39:14.766
My father was ill.

39:16.181 --> 39:21.393
He had Parkinson's and the
beginning of Alzheimer's.

39:23.809 --> 39:26.640
I gave up work to,
to care for him full time.

39:28.952 --> 39:32.024
He was suffering.

39:32.024 --> 39:34.855
But he could handle that.

39:34.855 --> 39:37.029
He was a hard man.

39:37.029 --> 39:42.587
But what he couldn't bear

39:42.587 --> 39:44.899
was losing his mind.

39:48.903 --> 39:53.425
He was quite lucid when--
when he first asked me to do it.

39:57.084 --> 39:59.293
But I said I couldn't.

39:59.293 --> 40:02.434
I couldn't do it, no way.

40:04.988 --> 40:07.853
But then he started--
he started to beg.

40:12.893 --> 40:17.207
And I knew that I--
it would cost me everything.

40:24.525 --> 40:29.875
But, you know,

40:29.875 --> 40:34.293
I was there for my father
when he needed me, at the end.

40:36.019 --> 40:38.470
And I wouldn't change that
for a thing.

40:40.714 --> 40:43.889
I'm sorry.

40:43.889 --> 40:47.030
I am. I'm sorry.

40:47.479 --> 40:50.206
But I...

40:50.206 --> 40:52.967
I get it.

40:52.967 --> 40:55.832
You're worried about your mum.

40:55.832 --> 40:57.489
Yeah.

40:59.836 --> 41:03.633
Bill, will you give us a minute?

41:03.633 --> 41:05.359
Yeah, of course.

41:11.261 --> 41:12.711
Mum...

41:12.711 --> 41:14.886
Let's go to the beach.

41:15.542 --> 41:18.061
I don't get it.

41:18.061 --> 41:20.754
The broken glass upset you
because it reminded you of--

41:20.754 --> 41:23.515
- Of my wife.
- So you called Pearl

41:23.515 --> 41:25.310
and not me.

41:25.310 --> 41:27.864
- I didn't think...
- What?

41:27.864 --> 41:29.107
What?!

41:29.107 --> 41:30.764
I didn't think
you could handle it.

41:30.764 --> 41:32.282
And what's that supposed
to mean?

41:32.282 --> 41:34.940
We don't talk about them.
My wife. Your husband.

41:34.940 --> 41:37.564
Because we agreed
we're moving on.

41:37.564 --> 41:39.013
To what? To poker nights
and quiz nights and church?

41:39.013 --> 41:40.670
It's called a social life.

41:40.670 --> 41:42.223
- There's no space.
- For what?

41:42.223 --> 41:43.984
- To be lonely?
- To be sad.

41:43.984 --> 41:46.987
I don't want to be sad!

41:52.026 --> 41:54.960
You talk in your sleep,
you know?

41:58.101 --> 42:00.207
You say her name.

42:04.832 --> 42:08.940
You called Pearl and not me.

42:09.734 --> 42:14.635
And not because of a smashed
glass, or your wife, or me.

42:17.120 --> 42:19.709
You called Pearl...

42:19.709 --> 42:24.403
because you love her, don't you?

42:28.753 --> 42:31.479
You love Pearl.

42:40.972 --> 42:44.044
I'm worried, Mum.

42:44.044 --> 42:45.459
Me too.

42:45.459 --> 42:46.943
I get it.

42:46.943 --> 42:48.738
You were really scared
that you were sick,

42:48.738 --> 42:50.257
and then we found
an explanation,

42:50.257 --> 42:52.673
and you've got this whole
new lease of life.

42:52.673 --> 42:53.985
But you've got to remember

42:53.985 --> 42:55.365
Bill's the reason
you were scared.

42:55.365 --> 42:57.436
I can't just ignore that.

43:00.267 --> 43:06.480
I think you were looking forward
to me moving in.

43:06.480 --> 43:08.344
Wait, you're worried about me?

43:08.344 --> 43:09.897
Charlie's left.

43:09.897 --> 43:12.762
You're on your own
for the first time.

43:12.762 --> 43:16.421
I'm not on my own.
I've got Tom.

43:16.421 --> 43:18.285
It's scary.

43:18.285 --> 43:20.183
I know the feeling.

43:21.426 --> 43:24.498
I feel as if I've been alone
for a long time now.

43:26.707 --> 43:28.329
So be happy for me.

43:31.712 --> 43:35.405
And think about what
makes you happy, too.
