00:16.433 --> 00:17.567
THERE.

00:17.600 --> 00:18.867
THERE WE GO, LARRY.

00:18.900 --> 00:20.500
LET ME GET THIS
COTTON OUT FOR YOU

00:20.533 --> 00:23.567
AND YOU'LL BE READY
FOR DR. FUNKHOUSER.

00:29.500 --> 00:30.800
THANK YOU, DELILAH.

00:30.833 --> 00:33.800
HEY, SAUL.

00:33.833 --> 00:35.033
HOW ARE YOU ?

00:35.067 --> 00:37.167
MM, LOST A CROWN.

00:37.200 --> 00:38.733
SORRY ABOUT LAST TIME.

00:38.767 --> 00:40.333
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
THROW UP THIS TIME.

00:40.367 --> 00:41.500
I SWEAR.

00:41.533 --> 00:42.800
I HOPE NOT.

00:42.833 --> 00:44.367
NOW, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
THAT YOU'RE ALLERGIC ?

00:44.400 --> 00:47.433
I CAN'T DO THE GAS,
IT JUST MAKES ME SICK.

00:47.467 --> 00:48.700
GO... AAH.

00:48.733 --> 00:49.833
WHAT'S THIS ?

00:49.867 --> 00:51.333
WE HAVE TO DO THIS NOW,
IT'S INSURANCE.

00:51.367 --> 00:52.367
OPEN UP.

00:52.400 --> 00:53.333
YOU'RE GONNA TAKE
A PICTURE OF MY MOUTH ?

00:53.367 --> 00:54.800
WIDE, OPEN UP WIDE.

00:54.833 --> 00:58.000
THAT'S VERY, VERY
ANGRY AND RED TODAY,

00:58.033 --> 01:00.600
BUT I THINK
IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

01:00.633 --> 01:03.100
BY THE WAY, IT WAS VERY
NICE OF YOU TO RSVP

01:03.133 --> 01:04.600
FOR MY UNCLE LEO'S
TESTIMONIAL.

01:04.633 --> 01:06.567
HOW CAN I MISS
HIS TESTIMONIAL ?

01:06.600 --> 01:08.967
I MEAN, I'VE GOT PEOPLE
COMING FROM RUSSIA, YOU KNOW.

01:09.067 --> 01:09.933
REALLY ?

01:09.967 --> 01:11.133
YEAHCOUSIN
COMING FROM RUSSIA.

01:11.167 --> 01:12.067
I DON'T SEE HIM
PLAYING GOLF
ANYMORE THOUGH.

01:12.100 --> 01:13.200
DOES HE STILL PLAY ?

01:13.233 --> 01:14.600
MY UNCLE LEO,
HE'S NOT A SPRING CHICKEN.

01:14.633 --> 01:15.933
YEAH, I KNOW.

01:15.967 --> 01:17.767
YOU KNOW, I MEAN, SOMETIMES HE'S
FEELING LIKE HE COULD DO IT,

01:17.800 --> 01:19.733
AND SOMETIMES HE DOESN'T
WANT TO EMBARRASS HIMSELF.

01:19.767 --> 01:21.067
ROLL UP AND
WE'LL DO THIS.

01:21.067 --> 01:22.333
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE ?

01:22.367 --> 01:23.600
IT'S A LITTLE SEDATIVE.

01:23.633 --> 01:25.133
YOU CAN'T TAKE THE GAS,
THIS IS THE ALTERNATIVE.

01:25.167 --> 01:26.167
OH.

01:26.200 --> 01:27.700
ROLL UP THE SLEEVE
AND WE'LL DO IT.

01:27.733 --> 01:29.967
COME ON,
COME ON, COME ON.

01:30.067 --> 01:31.067
YOU AFRAID OF
THE NEEDLE ?

01:31.067 --> 01:32.167
NO, NO, YOU KNOW WHAT,

01:32.200 --> 01:35.067
I'M JUST CONCERNED
THAT IF I ROLL IT UP,

01:35.100 --> 01:37.067
IT'S GONNA LOSE
ITS ELASTICITY.

01:37.067 --> 01:39.067
YOU SEE HOW IT KIND OF
CLINGS TO THE WRIST NOW ?

01:39.067 --> 01:41.333
THEY CALL IT AN ELASTIC CUFF
FOR A REASON,

01:41.367 --> 01:42.867
'CAUSE IT SNAPS BACK.

01:42.900 --> 01:44.700
YOU'D THINK IT WOULD,
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE A SOCK.

01:44.733 --> 01:45.867
A SOCK SNAPS BACK.

01:45.900 --> 01:48.333
YOU CAN WEAR A SOCK,
500 TIMES WITH NO PROBLEM.

01:48.367 --> 01:49.933
NO, SOCKS ARE CHEAP,
THEY DON'T SNAP BACK.

01:49.967 --> 01:51.167
IT TAKES MORE THAN ONCE FOR
IT TO LOSE ITS ELASTICITY.

01:51.200 --> 01:53.800
BELIEVE ME, ON VERY FEW
SUBJECTS I'M A EXPERT ON,

01:53.833 --> 01:55.767
AND I'M AN EXPERT
ON ELASTIC.

01:55.800 --> 01:57.667
ALRIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT,
YOU KNOW WHAT, LARRY ?

01:57.700 --> 01:58.900
IF YOU'RE THAT
CONCERNED ABOUT IT,

01:58.933 --> 02:00.167
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
TAKE IT OFF YOUR BODY,

02:00.200 --> 02:00.967
AND THEN YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ABOUT IT...

02:01.067 --> 02:02.133
OH, OKAY.

02:02.167 --> 02:04.067
SORRY, EXCUSE ME, UH,
MR. SHERMAN IS ON THE PHONE.

02:04.067 --> 02:05.900
WELL, JUST TALK TO HIM,
I'M WITH A PATIENT RIGHT NOW.

02:05.933 --> 02:06.733
HE NEEDS
TO TALK TO YOU.

02:06.767 --> 02:07.800
WHY ?

02:07.833 --> 02:09.067
IT'S THE ROOT CANAL,
HE'S CALLED THREE TIMES.

02:09.067 --> 02:10.633
ALRIGHT, OKAY, FINE,
ALRIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT,

02:10.667 --> 02:12.233
WE'RE JUST GONNA ROLL
THIS RIGHT UP RIGHT NOW

02:12.267 --> 02:13.500
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T
GOT THE TIME.

02:13.533 --> 02:15.067
I WAS GONNA TAKE
THE SHIRT OFF.

02:15.067 --> 02:17.500
I HAVE PEOPLE WITH REAL
PROBLEMS IN THERE, LARRY,

02:17.533 --> 02:18.800
AND I HAVE
TO DO THIS NOW.

02:18.833 --> 02:20.733
I HAVE AN HYSTERIC
ON THE PHONE,

02:20.767 --> 02:22.700
I HAVE PEOPLE
IN THE WAITING ROOM,

02:22.733 --> 02:25.067
AND THIS IS ENOUGH ALREADY,
IT'S ENOUGH !

02:25.067 --> 02:26.200
KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING ?

02:26.233 --> 02:27.667
FIVE MINUTES
YOU'RE GONNA FEEL FINE.

02:27.700 --> 02:28.500
WHAT LINE IS IT ?

02:28.533 --> 02:29.533
LINE ONE.

02:29.567 --> 02:33.233
OH, GREAT, LOOK,
HE RUINED THE SHIRT.

02:33.267 --> 02:34.467
LOOK, LOOK AT THIS CUFF,

02:34.500 --> 02:37.133
AND IT'S FLOPPING ALL OVER
THE PLACE, LOOK AT THAT.

02:37.167 --> 02:39.433
WHAT, WHAT'S,
WHAT'S WITH HIM ?

02:39.467 --> 02:40.967
HE'S NOT HIMSELF
RIGHT NOW.

02:41.067 --> 02:43.500
HIS UNCLE
HAS HODGKIN'S.

02:43.533 --> 02:46.367
YEAH, BUT IT'S
THE GOOD HODGKIN'S.

02:46.400 --> 02:48.400
I DIDN'T KNOW THERE
WAS A GOOD HODGKIN'S.

02:48.433 --> 02:50.700
I'M NOT SAYING
IT'S A GREAT HODGKIN'S.

02:50.733 --> 02:52.367
IT'S A GOOD HODGKIN'S.

02:56.233 --> 02:58.500
( phone ringing )

02:58.533 --> 02:59.733
( Cheryl )
I'LL GET IT.

02:59.767 --> 03:01.067
HEY, POP.

03:01.100 --> 03:02.133
MMM ?

03:02.167 --> 03:03.467
DO ME A FAVOR, OKAY ?

03:03.500 --> 03:07.967
NEXT TIME USE THE BATHROOM,
MAKE SURE TO KEEP THE SEAT DOWN.

03:08.067 --> 03:10.200
WHAT ARE YOU,
PUSSY WHIPPED ?

03:10.233 --> 03:13.300
IT'S NOT REALLY ABOUT HER,
IT'S ABOUT ME.

03:13.333 --> 03:15.133
I PEE SITTING DOWN.

03:15.167 --> 03:16.833
HOW LONG YOU
BEEN DOING THAT ?

03:16.867 --> 03:20.967
WELL, IT STARTED
BECAUSE I WAS GETTING UP
TO GO AT NIGHT SOMETIMES,

03:21.067 --> 03:23.700
AND, UH, I DIDN'T FEEL
LIKE PUTTING THE LIGHT ON,

03:23.733 --> 03:26.133
SO I WOULD SIT DOWN,
AND THEN I, YOU KNOW,

03:26.167 --> 03:28.067
I GOT VERY COMFORTABLE
WITH IT, YOU KNOW.

03:28.100 --> 03:30.200
COMFORTABLE WITH...
A MAN DOESN'T DO THAT.

03:30.233 --> 03:31.700
A MAN STANDS UP TO PEE,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?

03:31.733 --> 03:34.300
I LIKE TO SIT DOWN, AND I DON'T
WANT TO WIND UP IN THE TOILET,

03:34.333 --> 03:35.867
BECAUSE YOU'RE
KEEPING THE SEAT UP.

03:35.900 --> 03:36.767
KEEP THE SEAT DOWN.

03:36.800 --> 03:37.767
NO, YOU STAND
LIKE A PERSON.

03:37.800 --> 03:40.333
I'M VERY UPSET WITH THIS,
THIS IS CRAZY.

03:40.367 --> 03:42.300
YOU KNOW WHAT
WINSTON CHURCHILL SAID,

03:42.333 --> 03:44.267
"WHY STAND
WHEN YOU CAN SIT ?"

03:44.300 --> 03:45.333
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
THAT EXPRESSION ?

03:45.367 --> 03:46.567
NO, I NEVER HEARD
THAT EXPRESSION.

03:46.600 --> 03:48.133
BUT I DON'T THINK
HE MEANT THE TOILET.

03:48.167 --> 03:49.933
DO YOU WANT ME TO GET
THOSE GLAUCOMA DROPS

03:49.967 --> 03:51.100
FOR YOU AT
THE DRUG STORE ?

03:51.133 --> 03:52.633
YES, I'M JUST ABOUT
OUT OF THEM.

03:52.667 --> 03:54.967
GO PICK UP THE DROPS FOR ME,
AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

03:55.067 --> 03:55.833
OKAY.

03:55.867 --> 03:59.067
LARRY, SO THAT
WAS SUSIE.

03:59.100 --> 04:02.067
UM, THEY'RE HAVING
A DINNER PARTY ON FRIDAY,

04:02.067 --> 04:04.700
BECAUSE OF
THE FUNKHOUSER TESTIMONIAL,

04:04.733 --> 04:07.333
THEY'RE HAVING A LITTLE,
YOU KNOW, DINNER PARTY

04:07.367 --> 04:10.633
WITH MARTY FUNKHOUSER
AND THEY HAVE THEIR COUSINS

04:10.667 --> 04:11.833
COMING UP
FROM RUSSIA, SO,

04:11.867 --> 04:14.767
AND, UH, TED DANSON
WILL BE THERE WITH MARY.

04:14.800 --> 04:18.600
OH, OKAY, TED ASKED US
TO TAKE CARE OF HIS DOG.

04:18.633 --> 04:21.167
THEY'RE GOING OUT OF TOWN FOR
A COUPLE OF DAYS SO I SAID OKAY.

04:21.200 --> 04:23.067
US ?

04:23.067 --> 04:24.267
OH, YOU'RE NOT GONNA
DO ANYTHING ?

04:24.300 --> 04:25.533
IT'S JUST
GONNA BE ME ?

04:25.567 --> 04:29.067
I LIKE DOGS,
I'M VERY HAPPY TO DO IT.

04:29.067 --> 04:30.300
OKAY, YOU DO THAT.

04:30.333 --> 04:32.700
UH, LOOK WHAT THIS DENTIST
DID TO MY SHIRT TODAY.

04:32.733 --> 04:34.067
WHAT HAPPENED ?

04:34.067 --> 04:35.067
IT'S ALL STRETCHED OUT.

04:35.067 --> 04:36.467
YEAH, I KNOW.

04:39.233 --> 04:40.667
NO MATTER WHERE I SIT
AT THESE DINNER PARTIES,

04:40.700 --> 04:42.300
IT ALWAYS SEEMS LIKE
EVERY CONVERSATION

04:42.333 --> 04:44.833
IS MORE INTERESTING
AND ENTERTAINING THAN
THE ONE I'VE HAVING.

04:44.867 --> 04:46.233
RIGHT, MM-HMM.

04:46.267 --> 04:48.633
EXCEPT WHEN YOU'RE
SITTING NEXT TO ME.

04:48.667 --> 04:50.667
NO, IT STILL
FEELS THAT WAY.

04:50.700 --> 04:52.133
WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT, THE MAIL ?

04:52.167 --> 04:54.800
YEAH, I GRABBED IT
ON THE WAY OUT,

04:54.833 --> 04:57.933
OH, A BILL FROM
DR. FUNKHOUSER.

04:57.967 --> 04:59.100
YOU'RE KIDDING,
ALREADY ?

04:59.133 --> 05:01.367
YEAH, WONDER IF SAUL'S
GONNA BE THERE TONIGHT ?

05:01.400 --> 05:02.333
HE DIDN'T MENTION
ANYTHING TO ME ABOUT IT.

05:02.367 --> 05:03.533
I JUST SAW HIM.

05:03.567 --> 05:04.667
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE ALREADY SENT ME A BILL.

05:04.700 --> 05:05.533
BOY, THAT WAS FAST.

05:05.567 --> 05:07.233
NEEDS HIS MONEY.

05:07.267 --> 05:10.600
OOH, EEEW, AAAH !

05:10.633 --> 05:12.233
OH !
OH MY GOD.

05:12.267 --> 05:13.333
WHAT ARE YOU CRAZY ?

05:13.367 --> 05:15.100
YOU ALMOST,
WHAT'S GOING ON ?

05:15.133 --> 05:17.533
WHAT IS THAT ?

05:17.567 --> 05:19.733
HERE'S A COPY OF
THE PICTURE OF YOUR TOOTH

05:19.767 --> 05:20.667
FOR INSURANCE PURPOSES ?

05:20.700 --> 05:22.067
MY TOOTH,
THAT'S MY TOOTH ?

05:22.067 --> 05:24.167
OH MY GOD,
THAT'S IN YOUR MOUTH.

05:24.200 --> 05:25.467
WHY ARE THEY
SENDING IT TO ME FOR ?

05:25.500 --> 05:26.733
WHY DIDN'T THEY SEND IT
TO THE INSURANCE COMPANY ?

05:26.767 --> 05:27.967
I DON'T NEED
A COPY OF THAT !

05:28.067 --> 05:29.067
MY GOD !

05:34.900 --> 05:36.233
THIS IS GREAT.

05:36.267 --> 05:38.733
YOU CAME ALL THE WAY FROM RUSSIA
FOR YOUR UNCLE'S TESTIMONIAL ?

05:38.767 --> 05:41.833
( speaking Russian )

05:41.867 --> 05:45.400
YES, HIS FAVORITE UNCLE.

05:45.433 --> 05:46.833
FAVORITE UNCLE, HUH ?

05:46.867 --> 05:49.567
IT'S NICE, YOU GET TO SEE
YOUR COUSIN MARTY, RIGHT ?

05:49.600 --> 05:51.900
HE LOVES MARTY.

05:51.933 --> 05:54.233
I LIKE TALKING
THROUGH A TRANSLATOR.

05:54.267 --> 05:56.800
IT'S FUN, YEAH.

05:56.833 --> 05:59.700
I WISH I COULD DO
THIS WITH MY WIFE.

05:59.733 --> 06:02.633
( laughing )

06:05.100 --> 06:06.800
WHAT'S WITH
THE BARE FEET ?

06:06.833 --> 06:11.633
IT'S MORE COMFORTABLE
THIS WAY.

06:11.667 --> 06:13.700
FEELS LIKE AT HOME,
YOU KNOW.

06:13.733 --> 06:15.167
OH, YEAH ?

06:15.200 --> 06:18.133
UH, WHERE DID,
WHERE DO YOU,

06:18.167 --> 06:20.433
WHERE DO YOU BUY
YOUR GLASSES, IN FRANCE ?

06:20.467 --> 06:21.500
LOS ANGELES.

06:21.533 --> 06:24.100
CAN HE TRY IT ON ?

06:24.133 --> 06:25.400
UH, YOU KNOW WHAT ?

06:25.433 --> 06:28.867
I DON'T REALLY LIKE PEOPLE
TRYING MY GLASSES ON.

06:30.067 --> 06:31.233
JUST FOR ONE MINUTE.

06:31.267 --> 06:33.433
I'D RATHER NOT, I'M A LITTLE
UNCOMFORTABLE WITH IT, YEAH.

06:33.467 --> 06:38.200
OH, HE'S A GUEST HERE,
SO, LIKE...

06:38.233 --> 06:39.600
I UNDERSTAND.

06:39.633 --> 06:41.567
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
I NEED HIM TO TRY ON MY GLASS,

06:41.600 --> 06:45.167
UH, NO, NO, NO.

06:45.200 --> 06:47.200
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?

06:47.233 --> 06:48.667
NO !

06:48.700 --> 06:51.700
OKAY.

06:51.733 --> 06:57.933
THIS RUSSIAN
IS NUTS.

06:57.967 --> 06:59.633
HE JUST GRABBED
FOR MY GLASSES.

06:59.667 --> 07:01.100
OUT OF NOWHERE JUST
GRABBED FOR YOUR GLASSES ?

07:01.133 --> 07:03.167
JUST GRABBED MY GLASSES,
HE WANTED TO TRY THEM ON.

07:03.200 --> 07:05.233
I SAID I DON'T LIKE WHEN
PEOPLE TRY MY GLASSES ON.

07:05.267 --> 07:06.300
HE JUST GRABBED
FOR THEM ?

07:06.333 --> 07:08.467
YEAH, AND WHAT'S WITH
THE NO SHOES ?

07:08.500 --> 07:10.433
THAT'S GREAT,
I HAVE TO HAVE DINNER

07:10.467 --> 07:12.167
AND LOOK AT HIS
DISGUSTING FEET ALL NIGHT ?

07:12.200 --> 07:14.200
THEY'LL BE
UNDER THE TABLE.

07:14.233 --> 07:16.533
WHERE'S TED AND MARY ?

07:16.567 --> 07:17.867
THEY HAD A MOVIE PREMIERE,
THEY COULDN'T MAKE IT.

07:17.900 --> 07:19.667
OH, TOO BAD, TOO BAD.

07:19.700 --> 07:21.533
IT WOULD'VE BEEN NICE
TO HAVE HIM HERE.

07:21.567 --> 07:22.400
YEAH.

07:22.433 --> 07:23.800
INSTEAD OF ALL
THESE FUNKHOUSERS.

07:23.833 --> 07:25.267
YEAH, IT'S A CHOCK
FULL OF FUNKHOUSERS.

07:25.300 --> 07:27.400
( Susie )
JEFFREY, I NEED YOU
IN THE KITCHEN, HONEY.

07:27.433 --> 07:29.500

07:47.967 --> 07:51.200
ENJOYING THE DOG ?

07:51.233 --> 07:53.800
DINNER'S SERVED.

07:56.200 --> 07:58.867
( Susie )
AND HE'S GONNA
TAKE CARE OF TED'S DOG.

08:02.467 --> 08:03.667
VERY GOOD.

08:03.700 --> 08:06.867
YOU CAN STAY UP
'TIL 10, YOUNG LADY.

08:09.600 --> 08:11.333
HI, LARRY.

08:11.367 --> 08:13.367
HI, SAMMI.

08:13.400 --> 08:16.467
MAYBE YOU SHOULD TAKE
YOUR SHOES OFF LIKE THAT GUY.

08:16.500 --> 08:19.267
TAKE MY SHOES OFF LIKE
THAT GUY, I DON'T THINK SO.

08:19.300 --> 08:21.067
YOU COULD BE TWINS.

08:21.067 --> 08:23.300
YEAH, I DON'T WANT
TO BE TWINS WITH HIM.

08:23.333 --> 08:27.333
OH, NO, COME ON, SAMMI,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?

08:27.367 --> 08:30.967
SAMMI, SAMMI, COME ON,
GIVE ME THAT SNEAKER, SAMMI.

08:31.067 --> 08:34.500
HEY, LAR, YOU EVER HEAR
OF DENTA FRIEND ?

08:34.533 --> 08:35.667
DENTA FRIEND, NO.

08:35.700 --> 08:37.500
IT'S A NEW
SONIC TOOTHBRUSH

08:37.533 --> 08:39.233
THAT WOULD REALLY
GET RID OF YOUR PLAQUE.

08:39.267 --> 08:41.267
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
GET RID OF MY PLAQUE ?

08:41.300 --> 08:42.500
I DON'T HAVE
ANY PLAQUE.

08:42.533 --> 08:45.900
MY COUSIN'S HYGIENIST
TOLD ME YOU HAD PLAQUE.

08:45.933 --> 08:48.233
( speaking Russian )

08:48.267 --> 08:51.600
YOUR COUSIN'S HYGIENIST TOLD YOU
I HAVE A LOT OF PLAQUE ?

08:51.633 --> 08:55.533
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL ?
PLAQUE IS NOT A SERIOUS DISEASE.

08:55.567 --> 08:58.167
FIRST OF ALL, NUMBER ONE,
I DON'T HAVE ANY PLAQUE.

08:58.200 --> 08:59.667
( laughing )

08:59.700 --> 09:03.067
NUMBER TWO, SHE SHOULDN'T
BE TALKING ABOUT IT.

09:03.067 --> 09:05.500
THAT'S A BREECH OF
PATIENT/HYGIENIST
CONFIDENTIALITY.

09:05.533 --> 09:07.867
THERE IS NO PATIENT/HYGIENIST
CONFIDENTIALITY.

09:07.900 --> 09:09.333
YOU'RE SO WRONG,
THERE IS SO.

09:09.367 --> 09:11.233
IT'S UNETHICAL,
MAYBE NOT LEGALLY

09:11.267 --> 09:12.700
LIKE A DOCTOR
OR A LAWYER,

09:12.733 --> 09:14.133
BUT IT'S UNETHICAL
IS WHAT HE'S SAYING.

09:14.167 --> 09:15.400
IT'S TOTALLY
UNETHICAL.

09:15.433 --> 09:17.200
AND I DON'T HAVE
ANY PLAQUE BY THE WAY.

09:17.233 --> 09:18.333
DO I HAVE AN
ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSH ?

09:18.367 --> 09:19.133
HE HAS AN
ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSH.

09:19.167 --> 09:20.533
HOW OFTEN
DO I FLOSS ?

09:20.567 --> 09:21.867
AT LEAST
TWICE A DAY.

09:21.900 --> 09:23.233
TELL HIM I DON'T
HAVE ANY PLAQUE,

09:23.267 --> 09:24.533
OKAY, DID YOU
TELL HIM THAT ?

09:24.567 --> 09:25.800
YOU HAVE PLAQUE.

09:25.833 --> 09:27.433
YOU WANT TO HAVE A PLAQUE
CONTEST WITH ME, MARTY ?

09:27.467 --> 09:28.667
ANY TIME YOU WANT.

09:28.700 --> 09:29.600
ANY TIME YOU WANT.

09:29.633 --> 09:31.433
LET'S HAVE
A PLAQUE CONTEST.

09:31.467 --> 09:32.467
FINE, YOU WANT TO.

09:32.500 --> 09:34.200
CHALLENGE ME JUST
LIKE YOU DO IN GOLF.

09:34.233 --> 09:35.767
BY THE WAY, THAT TIP,

09:35.800 --> 09:38.067
REMEMBER THE TIP I GAVE YOU
AT BEN STILLER'S HOUSE ?

09:38.100 --> 09:38.933
HAVE YOU TRIED IT ?

09:38.967 --> 09:40.067
THE BEST TIP
I EVER GOT.

09:40.067 --> 09:41.433
FANTASTIC, YEAH.
FANTASTIC TIP ?

09:41.467 --> 09:44.400
HOLD IT, HOLD IT, I'VE GOT A TIP
THAT WILL SAVE YOUR GAME.

09:44.433 --> 09:46.533
CHANGE IT,
IT'S THE EASIEST THING,

09:46.567 --> 09:47.633
THE WEATHERMAN
GAVE IT TO ME.

09:47.667 --> 09:49.067
WEATHERMAN GAVE YOU
A GOOD GOLF TIP ?

09:49.067 --> 09:50.467
I PLAYED WITH HIM
TWO WEEKS AGO,

09:50.500 --> 09:53.367
AND IT'S CHANGED MY ENTIRE GAME,
AND IT IS SO SIMPLE.

09:53.400 --> 09:54.833
REALLY ?
WHAT IS IT ?

09:54.867 --> 09:56.167
LOCK YOUR HANDS
THIS WAY AND HOLD IT.

09:56.200 --> 09:56.800
WHICH WAY, OKAY.

09:56.833 --> 09:58.100
YEAH, OKAY.

09:58.133 --> 09:59.767
NOW, INSTEAD OF BRINGING
YOUR HANDS BACK LIKE THIS.

09:59.800 --> 10:00.633
RIGHT.

10:00.667 --> 10:02.333
YOU START
THE ROTATION--

10:02.367 --> 10:03.733
( Sammi screaming )

10:03.767 --> 10:06.900
SAMMI, WHAT IS IT ?
WHAT, WHAT ?

10:06.933 --> 10:08.967
WHAT IS THAT ?
WHAT IS THIS ?

10:09.000 --> 10:10.333
OH, IT'S DISGUSTING.

10:10.367 --> 10:11.433
WHAT THE HELL
IS THIS ?

10:11.467 --> 10:12.800
HEY, WAIT A SECOND.

10:12.833 --> 10:16.000
THAT'S A PICTURE
OF MY TOOTH,

10:16.033 --> 10:17.633
THE DENTIST TOOK IT
FOR INSURANCE PURPOSES.

10:17.667 --> 10:18.667
WHERE DID YOU
GET THAT ?

10:18.700 --> 10:20.867
IT JUST FELL OUT
OF LARRY'S JACKET.

10:20.900 --> 10:22.300
FELL OUT OF
MY JACKET ?

10:22.333 --> 10:23.767
WHAT ARE YOU LEAVING
STUFF OUT LIKE THAT FOR ?

10:23.800 --> 10:25.667
WHAT ARE YOU BRINGING THAT
INTO A PERSON'S HOUSE FOR ?

10:25.700 --> 10:28.267
SHE TOOK THE MAIL
INTO MY CAR.

10:28.300 --> 10:29.800
WHY WOULD YOU BRING IT
INTO THEIR HOUSE ?

10:29.833 --> 10:31.167
DISGUSTING, LARRY.

10:31.200 --> 10:32.567
WELL, IT WAS IN MY POCKET,
SHE WENT THROUGH MY POCKET.

10:32.600 --> 10:35.200
YOU KNOW WHAT ?
I THINK WE'RE GONNA LEAVE.

10:35.233 --> 10:37.133
ALRIGHT, WE HAD A GREAT TIME,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

10:37.167 --> 10:39.933
OKAY I'M SORRY ABOUT THIS, WE'LL
SEE YOU AT THE TESTIMONIAL.

10:39.967 --> 10:45.667
CROWN, I WAS GETTING A CROWN,
THAT'S ALL, AND...

10:45.700 --> 10:47.733
SHE SHOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
GOING THROUGH THE PAPERS.

10:47.767 --> 10:49.000
CHERYL,
IT'S DISGUSTING.

10:49.033 --> 10:51.867
IT IS DISGUSTING, BELIEVE ME,
I THINK WE'RE GONNA LEAVE.

10:51.900 --> 10:53.533
I'M NOT FEELING
VERY WELL.

10:53.567 --> 10:54.700
WHAT, YOU'RE
NOT WELL ?

10:54.733 --> 10:56.100
NO, I HAD
TOO MUCH CAKE.

10:56.133 --> 10:57.133
OH.

10:57.167 --> 11:01.067
OH, UM, I NEED MY,
UH, MY SNEAKER.

11:01.067 --> 11:02.667
LARRY, NOW IS NOT
THE TIME, OKAY.

11:02.700 --> 11:03.633
OK.

11:03.667 --> 11:05.100
YOU CAN GO HOME
WITHOUT YOUR SNEAKER.

11:05.133 --> 11:06.200
ARE YOU DRIVING ?

11:06.233 --> 11:07.433
YOU HAVE MORE
SNEAKERS AT HOME.

11:07.467 --> 11:08.867
OKAY, YOUR SOCK
MIGHT GET DIRTY.

11:08.900 --> 11:09.700
SAMMI, SAMMI,
WHERE'S MY-- ?

11:09.733 --> 11:11.333
( Cheryl )
LARRY !

11:13.267 --> 11:15.300
IT'S OKAY,
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

11:18.200 --> 11:20.800
YOU KNOW, SHE COULD HAVE
TOLD ME WHERE THE SNEAKER WAS.

11:20.833 --> 11:23.200
IT'S NOT THAT HARD.

11:23.233 --> 11:25.400
IN THE CLOSET,
THREE WORDS.

11:25.433 --> 11:29.133
ONE WORD, CLOSET,
HOW ABOUT THAT ?

11:29.167 --> 11:31.100
HOW ABOUT
THAT HYGIENIST ?

11:31.133 --> 11:34.333
IT'S, LIKE, IF YOU
GO TO A PROSTITUTE,

11:34.367 --> 11:36.200
AND THE PROSTITUTE
GOES AROUND TELLING EVERYBODY

11:36.233 --> 11:37.267
YOU GOT A SMALL PENIS,

11:37.300 --> 11:40.267
NOT THAT I'VE EVER
BEEN TO A PROSTITUTE.

11:40.300 --> 11:43.633
NOT THAT I HAVE
A SMALL PENIS, YOU KNOW.

11:43.667 --> 11:47.133
YOU PLUNK DOWN
$300 FOR A HOOKER,

11:47.167 --> 11:49.167
EXPECT HER TO KEEP
HER MOUTH SHUT.

11:49.200 --> 11:51.067
UGH.

11:51.100 --> 11:52.833
I'M ONLY GUESSING $300,
WHAT DO I KNOW ?

11:52.867 --> 11:54.500
WHAT ?

11:54.533 --> 11:56.267
MY STOMACH
IS KILLING ME.

11:56.300 --> 11:58.933
I AM NEVER GONNA EAT
AT THEIR HOUSE AGAIN.

11:58.967 --> 12:01.800
I SWEAR, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT SUSIE DOES WHEN SHE COOKS,

12:01.833 --> 12:03.167
BUT IT'S AWFUL.

12:03.200 --> 12:04.967
YEAH, IT WAS REALLY
PRETTY BAD, WASN'T IT ?

12:05.067 --> 12:06.967
OH, MY GOD,
IT WAS SO BAD.

12:07.067 --> 12:09.367
I WAS TRYING TO MAKE
MYSELF THROW UP.

12:09.400 --> 12:10.433
THAT'S HOW
BAD IT IS.

12:10.467 --> 12:12.333
OH, GOD,
POOR THING.

12:12.367 --> 12:15.600
OH, JUST FEEL
LIKE I NEED, UH...

12:15.633 --> 12:17.067
OH, QUIET, QUIET,
THE WEATHERMAN'S ON.

12:17.067 --> 12:19.300
By the beaches it is a bit cool,
around 70 degrees,

12:19.333 --> 12:21.600
but tomorrow's forecast,
folks, I'm sorry to say it,

12:21.633 --> 12:23.867
it is rain,
thundershowers,

12:23.900 --> 12:25.700
the big ones, folks,
all day.

12:25.733 --> 12:26.967
So for you golfers
out there,

12:27.067 --> 12:28.200
better find
something else to do.

12:28.233 --> 12:30.667
I know I'll be watching
that "Godfather" trilogy.

12:30.700 --> 12:31.800
Jennifer, Stu,
back to you.

12:31.833 --> 12:34.067
( phone ringing )

12:34.100 --> 12:35.933
HELLO.

12:35.967 --> 12:36.933
HEY.

12:36.967 --> 12:38.433
You listening
to this ?

12:38.467 --> 12:39.833
YEAH, I JUST SAW IT,
LISTEN...

12:39.867 --> 12:41.200
UH, I'M NOT GONNA PLAY.

12:41.233 --> 12:41.967
WHAT ?

12:42.067 --> 12:44.333
Come on,
it's gonna rain.

12:44.367 --> 12:45.467
HE'S ONLY SAYING
IT'S GONNA RAIN.

12:45.500 --> 12:46.500
WE DON'T KNOW
FOR SURE.

12:46.533 --> 12:47.567
HE'S ONLY SAYING
IT'S GONNA RAIN ?

12:47.600 --> 12:49.200
IT'S HIS JOB,
IT'S GONNA RAIN.

12:49.233 --> 12:50.233
LET'S WAKE UP
IN THE MORNING

12:50.267 --> 12:52.067
AND AT LEAST TALK
ON THE PHONE AND SEE...

12:52.067 --> 12:53.767
No, no, no, you know what,
I'm gonna stay home with Sammi.

12:53.800 --> 12:54.867
WHAT ?

12:54.900 --> 12:56.767
NO, SHE'S HAVING
A TOUGH, TOUGH NIGHT,

12:56.800 --> 12:59.400
AND I JUST THINK,
IT'D BE BETTER

12:59.433 --> 13:00.733
IF I STAYED HOME
WITH HER TOMORROW.

13:00.767 --> 13:03.867
HE'S NOT RIGHT
ALL THE TIME, YOU KNOW.

13:03.900 --> 13:05.433
WELL, HE'S RIGHT
MOST OF THE TIME.

13:05.467 --> 13:07.233
AND YOU KNOW WHAT, IT'S GONNA
RAIN TOMORROW, OKAY ?

13:07.267 --> 13:07.900
OKAY.

13:07.933 --> 13:10.333
BYE.
Bye.

13:28.267 --> 13:28.900
( splashing sounds )

13:28.933 --> 13:31.233
AAH !

13:31.267 --> 13:31.967
WHAT ?!

13:32.067 --> 13:33.733
AAAH !

13:33.767 --> 13:35.133
WHAT HAPPENED,
LARRY ?

13:35.167 --> 13:37.667
I FELL IN
THE TOILET.

13:37.700 --> 13:40.067
UH, DID YOU LEAVE
THE SEAT UP ?

13:40.067 --> 13:43.633
OH, I GUESS I DID
WHEN I TRIED TO THROW UP.

13:43.667 --> 13:45.267
OH, I'M SORRY.

13:45.300 --> 13:48.067
OH, YOU GOTTA KEEP
THE SEAT DOWN, CHERYL,

13:48.067 --> 13:51.133
THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK,
TO KEEP A SEAT DOWN !

13:51.167 --> 13:54.233
SOAKING WET.

13:54.267 --> 13:59.833
I HURT MY BACK,
SOAKING WET, OH.

14:03.933 --> 14:04.900
AAH...

14:04.933 --> 14:07.267
WHAT'S WRONG ?

14:07.300 --> 14:10.400
MY BACK, OH.

14:10.433 --> 14:14.700
WHAT A LOUSY
NIGHT'S SLEEP.

14:17.133 --> 14:19.967
MAN, CHERYL...

14:20.067 --> 14:22.333
IT'S BEAUTIFUL OUT.

14:22.367 --> 14:28.200
JEFF CANCELLED GOLF BECAUSE
THE WEATHERMAN PREDICTED RAIN.

14:28.233 --> 14:32.100
WELL, SOMETIMES
THEY'RE WRONG, LARRY.

14:32.133 --> 14:35.133
PREDICTS RAIN,
DOESN'T RAIN,

14:35.167 --> 14:37.267
IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME
THIS HAS HAPPENED.

14:37.300 --> 14:40.533
CHERYL, SOMETHING
FISHY'S GOING ON HERE.

14:40.567 --> 14:46.167
WHAT IF THE WEATHERMAN
PREDICTS IT'S GONNA RAIN

14:46.200 --> 14:49.400
JUST SO HE CAN KEEP
PEOPLE OFF THE GOLF COURSE

14:49.433 --> 14:50.833
AND HAVE IT
FOR HIMSELF,

14:50.867 --> 14:52.133
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THAT THEORY ?

14:52.167 --> 14:54.067
I THINK IT'S RIDICULOUS.

14:54.067 --> 14:55.200
REALLY, DO YOU ?

14:55.233 --> 14:56.300
MM-HMM.

14:56.333 --> 14:59.400
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT
WEATHERMAN I DON'T TRUST.

14:59.433 --> 15:00.833
I DON'T LIKE
THAT WEATHERMAN.

15:00.867 --> 15:03.933
HE'S A VERY
SLICK WEATHERMAN.

15:03.967 --> 15:07.533
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE
REALLY ON TO SOMETHING.

15:07.567 --> 15:10.100
I'M GONNA GO TO
THAT GOLF COURSE.

15:10.133 --> 15:12.400
WANT TO CHECK
SOMETHING OUT.

15:12.433 --> 15:14.067
GET MY CANE.

15:14.100 --> 15:17.267
OH, BROTHER.

15:27.067 --> 15:28.433
HEY, CHUCK.

15:28.467 --> 15:29.933
HEY, HOW'S IT GOING,
LARRY ?

15:29.967 --> 15:31.400
NOT BAD.

15:31.433 --> 15:34.067
HOW'S IT LOOKING
OUT THERE ?

15:34.067 --> 15:35.900
IT'S WIDE OPEN, MAN,
HARDLY ANYBODY OUT THERE.

15:35.933 --> 15:38.333
IS THAT RIGHT ?

15:38.367 --> 15:40.667
YEAH, HMM, PROBABLY
HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH

15:40.700 --> 15:42.367
THAT WEATHER
FORECAST.

15:42.400 --> 15:46.500
YOU KNOW WHAT,
PROBABLY DOES.

15:46.533 --> 15:48.067
HUH.

15:48.067 --> 15:51.467
HAVE YOU SEEN
THE WEATHERMAN OUT THERE ?

15:51.500 --> 15:53.167
WELL, YES, MATTER OF FACT,
THERE HE IS WITH,

15:53.200 --> 15:55.833
DR. FUNKHOUSER,
COMING UP ON THE NINTH HOLE.

15:55.867 --> 15:58.067
WHAT DO YOU KNOW ?

15:58.067 --> 15:59.733
SO, UH, WHAT'S
WITH THE CANE ?

15:59.767 --> 16:02.167
FELL IN THE TOILET.

16:11.767 --> 16:12.700
HEY, LAR.

16:12.733 --> 16:13.767
HEY, LARRY,
WHAT'S GOING ON ?

16:13.800 --> 16:14.667
BEAUTIFUL DAY, HUH ?

16:14.700 --> 16:16.100
YEAH, GREAT DAY
FOR GOLF.

16:16.133 --> 16:17.300
WHAT'S UP ?

16:17.333 --> 16:18.767
YEAH, YOU KNOW I WAS
SUPPOSED TO PLAY TODAY.

16:18.800 --> 16:19.833
REALLY ?

16:19.867 --> 16:21.867
THEN JEFF CALLED ME
LAST NIGHT AND CANCELLED

16:21.900 --> 16:25.467
BECAUSE OF YOUR WEATHER REPORT
ABOUT THUNDER SHOWERS.

16:25.500 --> 16:27.067
HE MADE A MISTAKE,
SO WHAT, COME ON.

16:27.100 --> 16:28.300
I SAID THERE WAS GONNA
BE THUNDER SHOWERS ?

16:28.333 --> 16:29.367
YEAH, YEAH.

16:29.400 --> 16:30.600
OOPS.

16:30.633 --> 16:32.467
UH-OH, OH, WOOP.

16:32.500 --> 16:33.933
YEAH, OKAY,
NICE TO SEE YOU.

16:33.967 --> 16:35.367
TOO BAD FOR ME...
TOO BAD FOR ME.

16:35.400 --> 16:37.133
TAKE CARE.

16:37.167 --> 16:39.833
I DON'T QUITE
GET YOUR POINT.

16:39.867 --> 16:42.267
ALRIGHT, WEATHERMAN,
I'M GONNA TELL YOU MY POINT.

16:42.300 --> 16:47.600
I'VE GOT A SNEAKING SUSPICION
THAT YOU'RE PREDICTING RAIN

16:47.633 --> 16:49.967
TO CLEAR THE GOLF COURSE
FOR YOURSELF.

16:50.067 --> 16:52.767
MY GOD,
COME ON, LARRY.

16:52.800 --> 16:54.133
THAT'S RIDICULOUS ?

16:54.167 --> 16:55.267
THAT'S RIDICULOUS,
LARRY, COME ON.

16:55.300 --> 16:57.400
IT'S HAPPENED BEFORE,
WEATHERMAN, YOU KNOW IT.

16:57.433 --> 16:58.567
AND YOU KNOW WHAT ?

16:58.600 --> 16:59.900
I'M CALLING THE WEATHER
PEOPLE ON YOU.

17:00.067 --> 17:00.967
AND YOU'RE GONNA SAY,

17:01.067 --> 17:02.767
UH, REPORT ME BECAUSE
IT'S A NICE DAY ?

17:02.800 --> 17:04.800
I'M GONNA REPORT YOU
BECAUSE EVERY TIME

17:04.833 --> 17:07.433
YOU WANT TO PLAY GOLF,
YOU MAKE SURE THAT IT'S RAINING.

17:07.467 --> 17:08.667
LARRY, LARRY,
FIRST OF ALL,

17:08.700 --> 17:10.500
I'M NOT A WEATHERMAN,
I'M A METEOROLOGIST.

17:10.533 --> 17:11.967
I'D APPRECIATE
A LITTLE BIT OF RESPECT.

17:12.067 --> 17:13.433
OH, EXCUSE ME,
DOCTOR.

17:13.467 --> 17:14.867
CAN YOU GUYS
JUST CALM DOWN ?

17:14.900 --> 17:16.800
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF
A GAME OF GOLF HERE, ALRIGHT.

17:16.833 --> 17:17.733
UH, LARRY ?

17:17.767 --> 17:19.067
YES.

17:19.067 --> 17:20.567
THERE'S A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM
SITTING OUT OVER THE COAST.

17:20.600 --> 17:22.333
THE JET STREAM BRINGS
THAT INTO THIS AREA.

17:22.367 --> 17:25.233
THE JET STREAM IS CONTROLLED
BY THE ROTATION OF THE EARTH.

17:25.267 --> 17:26.833
YOU KNOW WHO
CONTROLS THAT, GOD.

17:26.867 --> 17:29.100
YOU KNOW WHAT, THERE'S
A JET STREAM OF BULLSHIT

17:29.133 --> 17:30.833
COMI OUT OF
YOUR MOUTH, MY FRIEND.

17:30.867 --> 17:32.167
YOU ARE BUSTED, BUDDY.

17:32.200 --> 17:33.200
STOP POINTING
WITH THE CANE.

17:33.233 --> 17:33.933
YOU'RE BUSTED !

17:33.967 --> 17:36.067
YEAH, DR. FUNKHOUSER,

17:36.100 --> 17:37.500
I'D APPRECIATE IT NEXT TIME
IN THE OFFICE,

17:37.533 --> 17:40.067
DON'T ROLL UP MY SLEEVE IF
I REQUEST YOU NOT TO, OKAY ?

17:40.100 --> 17:41.333
LOOK AT, LOOK WHAT
YOU DID TO MY SHIRT ?

17:41.367 --> 17:42.233
WHAT DID I DO
WITH IT ?

17:42.267 --> 17:43.667
IT'S NOT CLINGING
ANYMORE.

17:43.700 --> 17:45.300
IT'S NOT CLINGING ?

17:45.333 --> 17:47.067
IT'S NOT CLINGING TO THE WRIST
THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO.

17:47.067 --> 17:49.133
FINE, OKAY,
YOU KNOW WHAT.

17:49.167 --> 17:50.900
AND, HEY,
ONE MORE THING, OKAY.

17:50.933 --> 17:52.167
WHAT ?

17:52.200 --> 17:54.567
FROM NOW ON, DON'T TAKE
ANY PICTURES OF MY MOUTH.

17:54.600 --> 17:55.667
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT ?

17:55.700 --> 17:57.200
YOU ALMOST GAVE MY WIFE
A HEART ATTACK

17:57.233 --> 17:58.967
AND YOU TRAUMATIZED
A LITTLE GIRL !

17:59.067 --> 18:00.700
WHAT ?

18:00.733 --> 18:02.067
HEY, WALTER BRENNAN,

18:02.067 --> 18:04.367
THE BARN'S ON FIRE,
THE BARN'S ON FIRE.

18:04.400 --> 18:06.467
I'M TURNING YOU IN,
WEATHERMAN.

18:10.133 --> 18:14.667
HEY, LARRY, WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU, BUDDY ?

18:14.700 --> 18:17.367
FELL IN THE TOILET.

18:17.400 --> 18:19.367
WHAT DO YOU MEAN ?

18:19.400 --> 18:22.100
CHERYL LEFT
THE TOILET SEAT UP.

18:22.133 --> 18:23.433
I FELL IN.

18:23.467 --> 18:25.900
REALLY ?

18:25.933 --> 18:26.867
YEAH.

18:26.900 --> 18:28.533
WELL, DID YOU
HURT YOURSELF ?

18:28.567 --> 18:29.867
YEAH, I HURT
MY BACK, YEAH.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.567
I'M SORRY, I SHOULDN'T
BE LAUGHING AT YOU.

18:31.600 --> 18:32.967
THAT'S ALRIGHT,
IT'S FUNNY, I GUESS.

18:33.067 --> 18:34.667
YEAH, WELL,
NO, I MEAN, IT'S...

18:34.700 --> 18:36.833
HEY, YOU KNOW, SOMETHING'S
THAT GOOD THAT I RAN INTO YOU,

18:36.867 --> 18:41.133
MARY AND I WERE TALKING
THIS MORNING, AND, UH,

18:41.167 --> 18:44.533
WHAT WE DECIDED TO DO IS
WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND BOARD,

18:44.567 --> 18:46.933
UH, ROXY,
OUR DOG, UM...

18:46.967 --> 18:48.400
WHAT ?

18:48.433 --> 18:50.367
I KNOW YOU OFFERED TO
TAKE CARE OF HER, BUT, UH,

18:50.400 --> 18:54.667
I JUST THINK IT'S BETTER
TO PUT IT INTO A KENNEL.

18:54.700 --> 18:56.833
IT'S A SMALL DOG, WOULDN'T
BE MUCH POINT ANY WAY.

18:56.867 --> 18:58.667
I WAS KIND OF LOOKING
FORWARD TO IT.

18:58.700 --> 19:00.133
I LIKE DOGS.

19:00.167 --> 19:04.967
YEAH, UM, I JUST THINK,
I JUST THINK, UH, YOU KNOW,

19:05.067 --> 19:07.067
MAYBE NEXT TIME
OR SOMETHING.

19:07.100 --> 19:09.233
UM, BUT I REALLY
APPRECIATE THE OFFER, I DO.

19:09.267 --> 19:10.833
THANK YOU, THAT WAS
VERY SWEET OF YOU.

19:10.867 --> 19:12.867
TALK TO SUSIE TODAY
BY ANY CHANCE ?

19:12.900 --> 19:14.900
YEAH, I TALKED
TO HER THIS MORNING.

19:14.933 --> 19:17.467
I HAD TO APOLOGIZE FOR NOT
BEING AT THE PARTY LAST NIGHT.

19:17.500 --> 19:22.700
SHE MENTION ANYTHING
ABOUT, UH, LAST NIGHT ?

19:22.733 --> 19:26.333
YEAH, SHE WAS KIND OF MIFFED
THAT WE DIDN'T CALL.

19:26.367 --> 19:28.067
WE HAD TO GO
SOMEPLACE ELSE.

19:28.067 --> 19:32.200
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO
BE THERE, BUT, UH, WHY ?

19:32.233 --> 19:33.100
NO REASON.

19:33.133 --> 19:36.067
UH, ALRIGHT,
I'M GOING TO,

19:36.100 --> 19:39.100
GONNA GO HIT SOME,
HIT SOME BALLS.

19:39.133 --> 19:42.233
I'LL SEE YA.

19:42.267 --> 19:44.233
YEAH, SEE YA.

19:55.233 --> 19:56.767
HEY.

19:56.800 --> 19:58.800
CAME FOR
MY SNEAKER.

19:58.833 --> 20:00.967
ALRIGHT,
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU ?

20:01.000 --> 20:02.600
I FELL IN
THE TOILET.

20:02.633 --> 20:04.067
HOW'D YOU FALL
IN THE TOILET ?

20:04.100 --> 20:06.867
I WENT TO GO PEE
AND THE SEAT WAS UP.

20:06.900 --> 20:08.667
WHAT DOES THAT
HAVE TO DO WITH YOU ?

20:08.700 --> 20:10.233
I PEE SITTING DOWN.

20:10.267 --> 20:11.433
YOU PEE SITTING DOWN ?

20:11.467 --> 20:12.767
YEAH, HAVE YOU
EVER TRIED IT ?

20:12.800 --> 20:13.667
NO !

20:13.700 --> 20:14.933
IT'S MORE COMFORTABLE,

20:14.967 --> 20:16.500
WHEN YOU GET UP
DURING THE NIGHT

20:16.533 --> 20:18.200
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TURN
THE LIGHT ON AND WAKE UP,

20:18.233 --> 20:19.967
AND YOU GET TO READ.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.033
WHAT ARE YOU
READING ?

20:21.067 --> 20:22.833
I'M READING
A LOT OF STUFF.

20:22.867 --> 20:23.833
WHAT STUFF ?

20:23.867 --> 20:25.667
IF I PEE 20 TIMES
DURING A DAY,

20:25.700 --> 20:27.967
I CAN GET THROUGH
THE WHOLE "NEW YORK TIMES",
FOR GOD'S SAKE.

20:28.000 --> 20:29.233
20 TIMES ?

20:29.267 --> 20:31.533
YEAH, HEY, BUDDY, WHEN YOU'RE
PEEING ALL OVER YOUR SHOE,

20:31.567 --> 20:32.733
I'M LEARNING
SOMETHING.

20:32.767 --> 20:34.200
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I'M PEEING OVER MY SHOE

20:34.233 --> 20:35.200
WHILE YOU'RE
LEARNING SOMETHING ?

20:35.233 --> 20:36.400
ALRIGHT, JUST GET
MY SNEAKER, WILL YOU ?

20:36.433 --> 20:37.567
I DON'T NEED
TO DISCUSS THIS.

20:37.600 --> 20:38.867
( Susie )
JEFFREY,
WHO'S THERE ?

20:38.900 --> 20:40.267
LARRY.

20:40.300 --> 20:43.400
CARMELITA, PUT OSCAR IN
THE BEDROOM AND CLOSE THE DOOR.

20:43.433 --> 20:46.800
( dog whimpering )

20:46.833 --> 20:47.867
HEY.

20:47.900 --> 20:48.933
HI, LAR.

20:48.967 --> 20:52.567
GET THIS, THE WEATHERMAN
IS A TOTAL FRAUD.

20:52.600 --> 20:55.733
HE PREDICTS THUNDER SHOWERS
SO NOBODY WILL SHOW UP

20:55.767 --> 20:57.433
AND HE'LL HAVE
THE GOLF COURSE TO HIMSELF.

20:57.467 --> 21:00.667
I JUST CAME FROM THERE,
HE'S PLAYING WITH YOUR COUSIN.

21:00.700 --> 21:02.900
WHY DO YOU PEE
SITTING DOWN ?

21:02.933 --> 21:04.700
MANY REASONS.

21:04.733 --> 21:06.433
YOU CRAP
STANDING UP ?

21:06.467 --> 21:09.433
BY THE WAY,
YOU LEFT LAST NIGHT.

21:09.467 --> 21:11.067
YOU WERE ABOUT TO GIVE ME
THE WEATHERMAN'S TIP

21:11.100 --> 21:12.067
AND YOU NEVER
GAVE IT TO ME.

21:12.067 --> 21:13.500
I CAN'T.

21:13.533 --> 21:14.800
HE JUST CALLED ME
ON MY CELL PHONE

21:14.833 --> 21:16.500
AND SAID "DON'T
GIVE IT TO LARRY."

21:16.533 --> 21:18.067
WHAT AN ASSHOLE.

21:18.067 --> 21:20.367
WELL, HE'S NOT AN ASSHOLE,
HE HAS HIS TIPS.

21:20.400 --> 21:22.400
HE IS AN ASSHOLE.

21:22.433 --> 21:25.367
WHAT THE FUCK
HAPPENED TO YOU ?

21:25.400 --> 21:28.400
CHERYL GOT NAUSEOUS
FROM YOUR DINNER LAST NIGHT,

21:28.433 --> 21:30.733
AND SHE LEFT
THE TOILET SEAT UP,

21:30.767 --> 21:32.900
AND THEN I WENT TO PEE
AND FELL ON THE TOILET.

21:32.933 --> 21:34.667
SHE DIDN'T GET SICK
FROM MY DINNER, LARRY, OKAY ?

21:34.700 --> 21:36.133
HEY, HOW ARE
YOU FEELING ?

21:36.167 --> 21:37.467
I'M NOT FEELING GREAT.

21:37.500 --> 21:40.067
YEAH, MARTY, YOU'RE NEVER
FEELING GREAT, OKAY.

21:40.100 --> 21:41.067
AND LET ME ASK
YOU A QUESTION.

21:41.100 --> 21:42.200
WHAT ?

21:42.233 --> 21:44.267
YOU TALK TO TED DANSON
TODAY BY ANY CHANCE ?

21:44.300 --> 21:46.067
YEAH, HE CALLED TO SEE
HOW THE PARTY WENT.

21:46.067 --> 21:50.867
MM, 'CAUSE I WAS SUPPOSED
TO TAKE CARE OF HIS DOG,

21:50.900 --> 21:55.133
AND THEN SUDDENLY HE
TOLD ME I DIDN'T NEED TO.

21:55.167 --> 21:56.900
MM, I WONDER WHY.

21:56.933 --> 22:00.567
YEAH, I WONDER.

22:07.100 --> 22:09.800
I'LL GET
YOUR SNEAKER.

22:11.900 --> 22:14.067
HEY, MARTY, LET ME
ASK YOU A QUESTION.

22:14.067 --> 22:17.367
DOES YOUR FATHER
HAVE GOOD HODGKIN'S ?

22:21.267 --> 22:23.733
OSCAR ATE IT.

22:30.333 --> 22:33.333
Well, I am the good news,
bad news kid.

22:33.367 --> 22:35.267
The good news is, folks,
that wonderful weather

22:35.300 --> 22:36.767
we've been enjoying
here all week

22:36.800 --> 22:38.833
in the whole Los Angeles basin,
that's gonna continue tonight,

22:38.867 --> 22:40.967
and all day tomorrow,
Saturday.

22:41.067 --> 22:43.100
So if you're going to
the Leo Funkhouser testimonial,

22:43.133 --> 22:44.100
I'll see you there.

22:44.133 --> 22:45.367
We're gonna have
a wonderful day and Leo,

22:45.400 --> 22:47.133
nobody deserves
this more than you do.

22:47.167 --> 22:50.367
but the bad news is
we have a cold weather front

22:50.400 --> 22:52.700
that's gonna push in around
midnight Saturday night.

22:52.733 --> 22:55.667
We're gonna have thunder showers
all day Sunday

22:55.700 --> 22:57.667
and they're gonna continue
all the way into Monday.

22:57.700 --> 23:00.433
Folks, don't shoot me,
I'm just the messenger.

23:00.467 --> 23:01.700
Alright, back to you.

23:04.100 --> 23:06.067
( Larry )
I'M NOT REALLY DRESSED
APPROPRIATELY FOR THIS THING.

23:06.067 --> 23:07.233
( Cheryl )
I THINK YOU'RE FINE.

23:07.267 --> 23:08.233
WHAT ARE YOU DOING,
WHAT'S THIS ?

23:08.267 --> 23:09.400
THESE ARE NAME TAGS.

23:09.433 --> 23:10.200
NAME TAGS ?

23:10.233 --> 23:10.567
MM-HMM.

23:14.500 --> 23:15.900

23:26.267 --> 23:27.533
I GOTTA WEAR
A NAME TAG ?

23:27.567 --> 23:29.067
YOU'RE A LITTLE
TOO SOPHISTICATED
TO WEAR A NAME TAG ?

23:29.100 --> 23:30.100
COME ON, LARRY.

23:30.133 --> 23:31.267
NO, IT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THAT.

23:31.300 --> 23:32.367
IT HAS TO DO
WITH MY JACKET.

23:32.400 --> 23:33.833
IF I PUT THIS ON,
IT'S GONNA LEAVE

23:33.867 --> 23:36.100
LITTLE PAPER REMNANTS ON IT,
IT'S GONNA RUIN THE SUEDE.

23:36.133 --> 23:37.933
LOOK, THIS COMES OFF,
IT GOES ON, ALRIGHT.

23:37.967 --> 23:39.433
IT'S JUST LIKE THAT.

23:39.467 --> 23:40.733
YOU KNOW WHAT ?

23:40.767 --> 23:42.133
YOU ALREADY RUINED A SHIRT
OF MINE BY ROLLING UP MY SLEEVE.

23:42.167 --> 23:44.767
THERE, OKAY, IT'S ON,
YOU'RE GONNA GO CELEBRATE

23:44.800 --> 23:46.200

COME ON, LET'S JUST GO INSIDE,
OKAY, WHAT DO YOU SAY ?

23:48.833 --> 23:50.100

ALRIGHT, OKAY, FINE,
THANK YOU FOR COMING, CHERYL.

23:51.967 --> 23:53.200
THANK YOU,
SAUL, OH.

23:53.233 --> 23:55.133
IT'LL BE FINE, IT'S NOT
VERY NICE SUEDE ANYWAY.

23:55.167 --> 23:56.967
OKAY.

23:57.067 --> 23:59.233
DID YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
IT WAS GONNA BE THIS BIG ?

23:59.267 --> 24:01.400
HERE'S OUR,
HERE'S OUR TABLE.

24:01.433 --> 24:04.867
HEY, THERE'S JEFF.

NO, WHY DON'T YOU SWITCH,
NOBODY'S GONNA NOTICE.

24:10.400 --> 24:11.400
I DON'T KNOW WHO
THESE PEOPLE ARE.

24:11.433 --> 24:12.300
SWITCH 'EM.

24:12.333 --> 24:13.433
COME ON,
WHO'S GONNA KNOW ?

24:13.467 --> 24:14.300
IT'S LIKE THEY DO THIS
TO US ON PURPOSE.

24:14.333 --> 24:16.333
EXCUSE ME,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?

24:16.367 --> 24:18.400
NO, I'M JUST MAKING SURE
ALL THE PLACE CARDS

24:18.433 --> 24:19.633
ARE WHERE THEY'RE
SUPPOSED TO BE, THAT'S IT.

24:19.667 --> 24:20.900
THIS IS MINE

24:20.933 --> 24:23.633
OH, YEAH, OKAY, JENNY AND SAM,

24:27.200 --> 24:30.067
UH, LISTEN, I HEARD ABOUT YOUR
TOOTH PLAQUE PROBLEM, AND--

24:30.100 --> 24:31.800
THE WHAT ?

24:31.833 --> 24:33.600
YOUR PROBLEM, YOU KNOW,
WITH YOUR TOOTH PLAQUE.

24:33.633 --> 24:34.900
NO, NO, NO, I DON'T HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH PLAQUE.

24:34.933 --> 24:35.967
WHERE'D YOU
GET THIS FROM ?

24:36.067 --> 24:37.500
WELL, IT'S NOT
IMPORTANT WHO SAID IT.

24:37.533 --> 24:38.533
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT ?

24:38.567 --> 24:40.300
THE HYGIENIST,
DID SHE TELL YOU, HUH ?

24:40.333 --> 24:42.100
I, I REALLY...

24:42.133 --> 24:43.667

24:43.700 --> 24:45.833
LISTEN, I KNOW ABOUT
THIS REALLY GREAT PRODUCT

24:45.867 --> 24:46.867
THAT COULD
HELP YOU OUT.

24:46.900 --> 24:48.267
I DON'T HAVE
A TOOTH PLAQUE PROBLEM.

24:48.300 --> 24:51.133
I FLOSS PROBABLY MORE OFTEN
THAN ANYBODY IN THIS ROOM.

24:51.167 --> 24:52.800
GOOD, DON'T NEED
TO KNOW.

24:52.833 --> 24:54.200
OKAY, JUST DO ME
A FAVOR, OKAY.

24:54.233 --> 24:55.767
N'T MENTION THIS.

24:55.800 --> 24:57.233
DON'T BE
SO SENSITIVE.

24:57.267 --> 25:00.767
IT'S NOT SOMETHING I DIDN'T
GROW UP DREAMING OF DOING THIS.

25:00.800 --> 25:02.567
IN FACT, IT'S NOT SOMETHING
I EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT.

25:02.600 --> 25:03.900
IT'S JUST SOMETHING
THAT I WAS GOOD AT.

25:03.933 --> 25:05.233
I KIND OF HAD THE VOICE
FOR IT SOMETHING I...

25:05.267 --> 25:08.167
WELL, IF IT ISN'T THE OLD
RELIABLE WEATHERMAN.

25:08.200 --> 25:10.333

25:19.300 --> 25:21.200
YEAH, EXACTLY

25:21.233 --> 25:24.700
I GOT A LITTLE TIP FOR YOU,
WEATHERMAN, OKAY ?

25:24.733 --> 25:25.700
OKAY.

25:25.733 --> 25:27.700
EXPECT TO FIND
A LITTLE COMPANY TOMORROW

25:27.733 --> 25:28.833
WHEN YOU'RE ON
THE GOLF COURSE.

25:28.867 --> 25:30.700

25:30.733 --> 25:31.967

25:34.533 --> 25:35.533
YOU WON'T SEE ME
OUT THERE.

25:35.567 --> 25:37.533
OH, I'M REALLY WORRIED,
WEATHERMAN, YEAH.

25:37.567 --> 25:38.233
YEAH, REALLY, IT'S GONNA,
BRING A SLICKER.

25:38.267 --> 25:39.233
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

25:39.267 --> 25:41.067
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK
TOMORROW, BUDDY.

25:41.067 --> 25:42.267
GOOD TO SEE
YOUR BACK'S BETTER.

25:42.300 --> 25:43.867
YEAH.

25:43.900 --> 25:46.633
WELL, THIS IS A GREAT DAY
AS YOU ALL KNOW

25:46.667 --> 25:48.733
HERE AT ROLLING VALLEY
COUNTRY CLUB.

25:48.767 --> 25:51.867
35 YEARS AGO
TO THIS DATE,

25:51.900 --> 25:55.967
MY FATHER LEO FUNKHOUSER
JOINED THIS CLUB.

25:56.067 --> 26:00.167
AND AT THE TIME
WE WERE THE FIRST
AND ONLY JEWISH FAMILY,

26:00.200 --> 26:03.667
AND TODAY WE STILL ARE,
BUT WE LOVE THIS PLACE.

26:05.867 --> 26:08.833
IT'S GREAT TO SEE
ALL YOUR FACES HERE.

26:08.867 --> 26:11.967
AND, UH, THIS IS A VERY
SPECIAL DAY FOR ALL OF US.

26:12.067 --> 26:16.367
YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT OFTEN THAT
A SON GETS TO HONOR HIS FATHER

26:16.400 --> 26:17.367
IN FRONT OF HIS FRIENDS.

26:17.400 --> 26:19.533
IT'S USUALLY
AFTER THE FACT.

26:19.567 --> 26:22.200
AND I'M SO PROUD OF MY DAD,
HE'S MEANT SO MUCH TO ME.

26:22.233 --> 26:25.533
WHEN WE WERE LITTLE,
AND I WAS A BABY...

26:25.567 --> 26:29.867
OH LOOK AT THIS,
LOOK AT THAT.

26:29.900 --> 26:31.867
THAT'S IT, THAT'S
THE END OF THE JACKET...

26:31.900 --> 26:34.700
WHEN I WAS THREE YEARS OLD
HE COULDN'T DO IT ANY MORE

26:34.733 --> 26:35.867
'CAUSE I WAS TALLER
THAN HE WAS.

26:35.900 --> 26:39.900
WELL, WHAT A GREAT DAY.

26:39.933 --> 26:41.633
UH, THERE'S NOT
A LOT I CAN SAY.

26:41.667 --> 26:44.800
LEO, RIGHT NOW,
AS YOU ALL KNOW, HAS RETIRED.

26:44.833 --> 26:47.633
MY MOM COULDN'T BE HERE
TONIGHT OF COURSE.

26:47.667 --> 26:49.567
SHE PASSED AWAY
10 YEARS AGO...

26:49.600 --> 26:55.900
( speaking Russian )

26:55.933 --> 26:59.067
EXCUSE ME, EXCUSE ME, CAN YOU
KEEP IT DOWN A LITTLE BIT,

26:59.067 --> 27:00.433
'CAUSE IT'S VERY,
IT'S LOUD.

27:00.467 --> 27:02.233
I HAVE TO TRANSLATE
TO MY HUSBAND.

27:02.267 --> 27:03.533
HE DOESN'T
UNDERSTAND.

27:03.567 --> 27:04.900
I UNDERSTAND,
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT,

27:04.933 --> 27:06.433
JUST BE A LITTLE QUIETER,
THAT'S ALL.

27:06.467 --> 27:09.467
YEAH, DRINK YOUR TEA OR COFFEE,
WHATEVER YOU SAID,

27:09.500 --> 27:10.433

27:10.467 --> 27:11.700
I'M JUST TRYING
TO HEAR WHAT,

27:11.733 --> 27:13.500
I'M TRYING TO HEAR WHAT
YOUR COUSIN HAS TO SAY.

27:13.533 --> 27:16.400

27:16.433 --> 27:18.100

27:18.133 --> 27:19.433
WHAT DID HE SAY ?

27:19.467 --> 27:21.200

27:21.233 --> 27:23.433

ANY PLAQUE, OKAY, YEAH.

27:23.467 --> 27:26.800

MOUTH FULL OF PLAQUE.

27:26.833 --> 27:32.133
OH, YEAH, AT LEAST I DON'T HIDE
MY BALDNESS WITH A YARMULKE.

27:34.067 --> 27:35.467
HUH, HE HAS MORE
HAIR THAN YOU DO.

27:35.500 --> 27:36.733
I'LL BET YOU GOT
NOTHING UNDER.

27:36.767 --> 27:39.200
OKAY, HE'LL SHOW IT TO YOU
IF YOU'LL SHOW HIM GLASSES.

27:39.233 --> 27:41.833

TOUCH MY GLASSES, YEAH.

27:41.867 --> 27:43.633
