(laughs)

00:41.542 --> 00:43.675
(woman coughing)

00:45.445 --> 00:47.946
Murray? Murray?

00:47.948 --> 00:49.381
Hey, jerk chicken.

00:49.383 --> 00:50.783
Where's my Jew at?

00:50.785 --> 00:51.950
Oh, I'm sorry, Rallo.

00:51.952 --> 00:53.786
Murray's out with
a friend today.

00:53.788 --> 00:54.987
A friend?

00:54.989 --> 00:56.088
But I'm his only friend.

00:56.090 --> 00:57.456
Not to worry, child.

00:57.458 --> 01:00.993
You're welcome to take one
of our other old people.

01:01.861 --> 01:03.295
We got the Black-Filipino

01:03.297 --> 01:05.097
if you like exotic,

01:05.099 --> 01:08.267
Ruby-- she has no memory,
so you can do whatever you want.

01:08.269 --> 01:10.302
We even got twins.

01:10.304 --> 01:12.004
Double the hard candy.

01:12.006 --> 01:13.839
I'm Connie Chung.

01:15.041 --> 01:16.308
Rallo!

01:16.310 --> 01:17.676
What are you doing here?

01:17.678 --> 01:19.678
What the hell you
think I'm doing here?

01:19.680 --> 01:20.946
We have plans!

01:20.948 --> 01:22.147
Who's this broad?

01:22.149 --> 01:24.116
Hi, Rallo. I'm Hazel.

01:24.118 --> 01:27.152
Oh, I've heard
so much about you.

01:27.154 --> 01:28.353
Oh, you're right.

01:28.355 --> 01:29.922
It <i>is</i> like a sponge!

01:29.924 --> 01:32.024
Hey, get your zombie
hands off my head!

01:32.026 --> 01:33.292
Come on, Murray.

01:33.294 --> 01:34.927
Let's go sit
on a park bench

01:34.929 --> 01:37.596
and watch people try
to figure us out.

01:37.598 --> 01:40.632
Look, kid, I promise you
we'll do something tomorrow,

01:40.634 --> 01:42.101
just us guys.

01:42.103 --> 01:46.305
But I think I'm about to end
a 35-year dry spell here.

01:46.307 --> 01:48.674
It's gonna be gross.

01:49.976 --> 01:52.044
I bet they're gonna use
the pull-up method.

01:52.046 --> 01:54.246
Get it? They're old.

01:57.117 --> 01:59.418
Hey, Ro-Ro,

01:59.420 --> 02:00.919
if you're done with
your chicken fat,

02:00.921 --> 02:02.254
may I soak my
roll in it?

02:02.256 --> 02:03.589
Whatever, Fat Albert.

02:03.591 --> 02:06.125
Hey, hey! Hey.

02:06.127 --> 02:07.826
Thank you.

02:07.828 --> 02:09.995
Bones?

02:09.997 --> 02:11.930
(bones crunching)

02:11.932 --> 02:13.632
(groans)

02:13.634 --> 02:15.000
You're eating
bones, Cleveland?

02:15.002 --> 02:16.969
I grew up during the Depression.

02:16.971 --> 02:18.604
If you'd be so kind

02:18.606 --> 02:20.672
as to hand me
my bloody-coughing rag.

02:20.674 --> 02:22.774
(coughing)

02:27.947 --> 02:29.715
He's sloppy fat.

02:29.717 --> 02:31.783
I'm classy fat.

02:37.023 --> 02:39.091
Ah.

02:40.026 --> 02:41.360
Ah.

02:41.362 --> 02:42.694
Night.

02:42.696 --> 02:43.862
Unless you want to fool...

02:43.864 --> 02:45.197
(burps) ...around.

02:45.199 --> 02:47.299
Do you really need a
milkshake before bed?

02:47.301 --> 02:49.968
Do you really need three glasses
of wine with dinner?

02:49.970 --> 02:51.537
I had one glass.

02:51.539 --> 02:56.108
Pouring three glasses into one
does not a single glass make.

02:56.110 --> 02:59.111
Cleveland, you've gained 25
pounds since we got married.

02:59.113 --> 03:01.713
You wouldn't be complaining
if we lived in England.

03:01.715 --> 03:04.082
Because there,
pounds are money.

03:04.084 --> 03:06.518
Cleveland, you have
to join a gym.

03:06.520 --> 03:09.121
I know I said your weight
gain is unhealthy,

03:09.123 --> 03:11.957
but there's a... visual
component, as well.

03:11.959 --> 03:14.459
And yes, we turn out
the lights during sex.

03:14.461 --> 03:15.827
Mm.

03:15.829 --> 03:18.130
But every once in a
while, a car drives by,

03:18.132 --> 03:19.965
and a sliver of light
shines through,

03:19.967 --> 03:21.767
and I get an
awful fright.

03:21.769 --> 03:25.137
Look, I don't want to tell you
how to do your job as a woman,

03:25.139 --> 03:26.939
but as a man, that's my job.

03:26.941 --> 03:28.874
Women don't care how men look.

03:28.876 --> 03:32.277
They only care about emotions
and stuff and baths.

03:32.279 --> 03:34.646
Cleveland, I got you
a gym membership

03:34.648 --> 03:36.348
and a personal trainer.

03:36.350 --> 03:39.251
Speaking of member,
'member this?

03:39.253 --> 03:41.587
(grunting)

03:42.822 --> 03:44.923
(grunting)

03:45.858 --> 03:47.192
(sighs)

03:47.194 --> 03:49.328
And boom goes the dynamite.

03:49.330 --> 03:52.030
(snores and whistles)

03:54.267 --> 03:56.435
Hey, little fella.

03:56.437 --> 03:57.869
Beat it, perv.

03:57.871 --> 04:00.806
This right here is no country
for old men.

04:00.808 --> 04:02.975
Rallo, it's me.

04:02.977 --> 04:04.876
What is that,
your winter yarmulke?

04:04.878 --> 04:08.714
No, it's a hairpiece
to make me look young and hot,

04:08.716 --> 04:10.983
like that douche bag
Jeremy Piven.

04:10.985 --> 04:12.918
Why you got to talk
about Jeremy Piven?

04:12.920 --> 04:14.753
Come on, our
table's back here.

04:14.755 --> 04:17.990
We already had our soup and
sent back our first two courses.

04:17.992 --> 04:19.992
Ha! Wait. We?

04:22.595 --> 04:23.996
Hi, Rallo!

04:23.998 --> 04:26.298
I'm so glad you
could join us.

04:26.300 --> 04:28.000
Excuse me?!

04:28.002 --> 04:29.968
What's Wrinkle Me Elma
doing here?

04:29.970 --> 04:32.004
You said it was
just gonna be us.

04:32.006 --> 04:33.438
You tell that face "no."

04:33.440 --> 04:35.540
(both moaning)

04:39.979 --> 04:44.116
Well... I don't have
an old people fetish.

04:45.018 --> 04:47.819
I believe these are yours?

04:47.821 --> 04:48.920
No.

04:48.922 --> 04:51.123
Oh. Then they're mine. I...

04:51.125 --> 04:53.592
I must have put in two
this morning.

04:53.594 --> 04:56.495
Rallo, we got you a beet salad.

04:56.497 --> 04:58.263
Well, you can't beat beets.

04:58.265 --> 05:00.465
ANNOUNCER:
<i>they'll make you pee red!</i>

05:00.467 --> 05:02.868
SINGERS (in harmony):
♪ It's not blood!

05:02.870 --> 05:05.704
It happens
to be Hazel's birthday today.

05:05.706 --> 05:08.807
By the way,
what did I end up getting you?

05:08.809 --> 05:10.509
(dinging)

05:10.511 --> 05:12.044
Wow. They're nice.

05:12.046 --> 05:13.645
I must like you.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.147
(laughs)

05:15.149 --> 05:17.916
For my birthday, you pulled
a penny out of my ear.

05:17.918 --> 05:19.284
Then you kept it.

05:19.286 --> 05:21.386
Oh, she's got my card.

05:22.622 --> 05:23.922
She's got your wallet?

05:23.924 --> 05:25.624
Murray, come on. Wake up.

05:25.626 --> 05:27.292
She's just using you
for your money.

05:27.294 --> 05:28.760
Using me?

05:28.762 --> 05:30.629
Using me for this.

05:30.631 --> 05:33.598
(both moaning,
Hazel giggles)

05:33.600 --> 05:35.834
And your pastrami on rye.

05:35.836 --> 05:38.770
What am I,
(bleep) Scooby-Doo?

05:42.809 --> 05:45.210
Hi. Cleveland Brown,
new gym member?

05:45.212 --> 05:47.446
Oh, yes, I can see that, sir.

05:47.448 --> 05:50.182
The locker room
is right behind you.

05:51.250 --> 05:52.651
(water running)

05:52.653 --> 05:54.252
There are naked
men in there!

05:54.254 --> 05:56.121
It's a locker room, sir.

05:56.123 --> 05:58.623
I know that, but in my day,

05:58.625 --> 06:01.026
a man wrapped a towel
around his waist,

06:01.028 --> 06:03.362
then removed his briefs
from underneath.

06:03.364 --> 06:05.664
Modesty! Always modesty!

06:05.666 --> 06:06.965
MAN:
Yo, C-Bro!

06:06.967 --> 06:09.167
Ready for me to
get you rock hard?

06:09.169 --> 06:10.836
Holt? You work here?

06:10.838 --> 06:12.304
Yeah, I'm a
personal trainer.

06:12.306 --> 06:14.473
I've told you that,
like, a hundred times.

06:14.475 --> 06:17.676
I got a real thick filter
with you, Holt.

06:17.678 --> 06:21.046
Look, this whole gym silliness
was Donna's idea.

06:21.048 --> 06:23.048
She gets
on these kicks.

06:23.050 --> 06:25.450
Tried to get me
to brush my teeth for a while.

06:25.452 --> 06:26.752
(scoffs)

06:26.754 --> 06:28.186
Relax. You're gonna
love it here, brah.

06:28.188 --> 06:29.921
We got a steam room,
smoothie bar

06:29.923 --> 06:31.957
and terrible clothing on sale.

06:31.959 --> 06:33.992
Not to mention the babes.

06:33.994 --> 06:36.194
Hi. Bye.
(sighs)

06:36.196 --> 06:37.929
Hi. Bye.

06:37.931 --> 06:39.197
Hi. Bye.

06:39.199 --> 06:41.666
(chuckling):
Hel-lo!

06:41.668 --> 06:43.101
Yeah. They're lesbians.

06:43.103 --> 06:44.970
All lesbians.
With boyfriends.

06:44.972 --> 06:47.272
Now, come on. I'm gonna
start you out real easy.

06:47.274 --> 06:49.841
Step on the treadmill.

06:49.843 --> 06:51.109
Ah, this isn't bad.

06:51.111 --> 06:52.778
It's not on.
(beep)

06:52.780 --> 06:53.979
The floor is moving!

06:53.981 --> 06:55.881
You have to walk,
Cleveland.

06:55.883 --> 06:57.516
(panting)

06:57.518 --> 06:59.818
Water. Must have water.

06:59.820 --> 07:01.987
Okay, man, I'm just
gonna increase this

07:01.989 --> 07:03.922
from a walk
to a light trot.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.123
(high-pitched whirring)

07:05.125 --> 07:08.126
How many miles have I gone?
12? 17?

07:08.128 --> 07:09.861
Ugh! I forgot my nipple guards.

07:09.863 --> 07:11.196
Are they bleeding?

07:11.198 --> 07:12.664
It stings like they're bleeding.

07:12.666 --> 07:13.932
Stop the machine!

07:13.934 --> 07:15.867
It's only been 15 seconds, bro.

07:15.869 --> 07:17.169
Oh, God.

07:17.171 --> 07:19.504
I no feel so <i>bueno.</i>

07:19.506 --> 07:20.972
(echoing):
You're doing great.

07:20.974 --> 07:24.376
I... think I'm gonna pass out.

07:26.345 --> 07:28.313
Keep that core tight.

07:28.315 --> 07:30.415
I'll be back in ten minutes.

07:32.018 --> 07:33.985
(birds singing,
pigeons cooing)

07:33.987 --> 07:36.822
Mm. Those lucky pigeons.

07:36.824 --> 07:39.424
Ugh! We've been following
Hazel all day,

07:39.426 --> 07:41.827
but still no proof
that she's a gold digger.

07:41.829 --> 07:44.062
(imitates siren blaring)

07:46.098 --> 07:47.699
(whispers):
We got something.

07:49.302 --> 07:52.070
Another man.
Let's move in.

07:55.208 --> 07:58.043
(camera shutter clicking)

08:01.347 --> 08:02.948
Happy birthday, Hazel.

08:02.950 --> 08:04.483
What did I get you?

08:04.485 --> 08:05.984
Diamond necklace.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.986
Goo, goo.
Gotcha!

08:07.988 --> 08:11.389
You're nothing but a two-timing,
gold-digging old wench.

08:12.024 --> 08:14.860
Aren't you adorable.

08:14.862 --> 08:16.995
(gasps)
Now listen to me
and you listen good,

08:16.997 --> 08:18.330
you nosey little punk.

08:18.332 --> 08:21.099
If you tell a soul about this,
I will snap your neck in half,

08:21.101 --> 08:23.101
and then I'll suck your
guts out with a straw,

08:23.103 --> 08:26.938
and then spit them out because
I... hate.... your... guts.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.707
Are we clear?

08:28.709 --> 08:29.941
Yes!

08:29.943 --> 08:32.611
Now go sleep
with the ducks.

08:32.613 --> 08:33.979
(yelling)

08:33.981 --> 08:35.380
My baby!

08:44.290 --> 08:47.092
See, I jump you
three times.

08:47.094 --> 08:51.863
Oh, speaking of jumping you,
I think the pill is kicking in.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.633
Ooh! I thought that
was my sciatica.

08:54.635 --> 08:57.135
Murray, listen,
Hazel's two-timing you.

08:57.137 --> 08:59.204
I'm not afraid of you, old lady!

08:59.206 --> 09:00.805
I brought muscle.

09:00.807 --> 09:02.974
Ugh! Why are you
still in the dress?

09:02.976 --> 09:05.076
Take that thing off.

09:07.947 --> 09:09.648
Put it back on.

09:09.650 --> 09:12.617
Murray, I saw Hazel
with another man.

09:12.619 --> 09:14.920
And he was giving her
jewelry, too.

09:14.922 --> 09:17.122
Rallo, I was buying
that jewelry.

09:17.124 --> 09:18.857
For our wedding.

09:18.859 --> 09:20.492
We're getting married.

09:20.494 --> 09:22.294
What?! You can't
marry her!

09:22.296 --> 09:23.962
She threatened
to kill me!

09:23.964 --> 09:25.130
Oh, Rallo.
(laughs)

09:25.132 --> 09:26.798
That's ridiculous.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.533
If there's one thing
you should know

09:28.535 --> 09:32.304
about old Jewish people--
we don't hate anybody.

09:32.306 --> 09:34.039
Our wedding is
this weekend,

09:34.041 --> 09:36.007
and we'd love it if
you would be there.

19:47.187 --> 19:49.086
I'm lazy.
I hate working out.

19:49.088 --> 19:51.756
It's for gay guys
and probably gay guys.

19:51.758 --> 19:54.959
I know you can't stand
to look at my fat body

19:54.961 --> 19:56.961
or listen to
my fat voice.

19:56.963 --> 20:00.131
I just wanted you to
want to make love to me.

20:00.133 --> 20:01.766
I'm so sorry.

20:01.768 --> 20:03.868
(derisive laughter)

20:03.870 --> 20:06.604
(laughter continues)

20:06.606 --> 20:09.840
Oh, Cleveland!
Yes, you're obese

20:09.842 --> 20:12.009
and a heart attack
waiting to happen,

20:12.011 --> 20:14.979
and no 40-year-old man should
make ham-and-cheese sandwiches

20:14.981 --> 20:16.214
with toaster waffles.

20:16.216 --> 20:17.548
It's just a McGriddle!

20:17.550 --> 20:19.350
But you know what?
Nobody's perfect.

20:19.352 --> 20:21.586
None of you is perfect!

20:21.588 --> 20:23.154
And neither am I!

20:23.156 --> 20:24.589
I wear a wig!

20:24.591 --> 20:25.957
Yeah!
(others gasp)

20:25.959 --> 20:28.459
And these perfect eyebrows
and luscious lips--

20:28.461 --> 20:30.561
drawn on.

20:31.363 --> 20:32.997
And do you really think a woman

20:32.999 --> 20:35.633
who's breast-fed two kids
can still be this perky?

20:35.635 --> 20:38.869
Please! And that's the truth.

20:38.871 --> 20:40.371
The ugly truth.

20:41.506 --> 20:44.408
Oh, Donna, I love you.

20:47.012 --> 20:49.213
♪

20:50.148 --> 20:51.849
(others exclaim)

20:51.851 --> 20:53.985
(others groan in disgust)

20:53.987 --> 20:56.420
And boom goes the dynamite.

20:56.422 --> 21:00.091
Now, <i>this</i> is a
superintendent's dinner!

21:00.093 --> 21:02.093
I'm the superintendent,
by the way.

21:02.095 --> 21:03.694
Good night, everyone.
