WEBVTT

00:02.208 --> 00:04.708
Mom, Dad, great news.

00:04.708 --> 00:06.583
Since Harper and I
graduated high school,

00:06.583 --> 00:09.583
we decided that we're ready
to get our own apartment
and move out!

00:09.583 --> 00:11.416
What do you think?

00:11.416 --> 00:12.833
I think they love it.

00:12.833 --> 00:14.750
- Oh, my goodness,
let's start packing now.
- Yeah!

00:14.750 --> 00:17.875
Wait a second!
Did I hear you correctly?

00:17.875 --> 00:19.583
You graduated high school?

00:22.000 --> 00:23.625
Nice parenting!

00:25.250 --> 00:27.625
Listen, Alex...
You want to move out?

00:29.208 --> 00:31.458
I don't think you guys
have thought this through.

00:31.458 --> 00:34.333
Doesn't matter.
Because I have.

00:34.333 --> 00:36.833
I've actually been waiting
for this moment for years.

00:36.833 --> 00:38.375
Here, check it out.

00:38.375 --> 00:41.875
Here's a blueprint of the house
without Alex in it.

00:43.625 --> 00:45.375
Well, where's my room?

00:45.375 --> 00:49.166
Gone. I'm going to build
my laboratory in it.

00:49.166 --> 00:52.708
Bonus, you can never move
back in or visit.

00:55.583 --> 00:58.333
Alex, honey, moving out
is a very big deal.

00:58.333 --> 01:00.208
For one thing,
you're gonna need money,

01:00.208 --> 01:02.208
for things like food, rent...

01:02.208 --> 01:04.750
Oh, come on, Alex
and I agreed years ago

01:04.750 --> 01:07.458
that when we had enough
money saved, we'd move out.

01:07.458 --> 01:10.166
- Right, Alex?
- Yeah.

01:11.416 --> 01:12.958
I have a quarter.

01:13.708 --> 01:15.583
What about utilities?

01:15.583 --> 01:17.000
Where are you gonna
get the money for that?

01:17.000 --> 01:19.958
Oh, I just figured
I'd take some from here.

01:25.208 --> 01:27.333
Those are utensils.

01:27.333 --> 01:30.500
Well, then I don't know
what utilities are...

01:32.000 --> 01:33.500
...so I probably
don't need 'em.

01:33.500 --> 01:39.333
Oh, really? So you don't need
gas, heat, water, phone?

01:39.333 --> 01:43.083
You know, usually roommates
share the cost of those things.

01:44.125 --> 01:45.750
Did you know
about all that?

01:45.750 --> 01:48.625
Yes, Alex, I knew
we'd need water.

01:50.750 --> 01:53.833
If you two can earn
enough money to move out,

01:53.833 --> 01:57.833
that will prove how serious
you are, and we'd be supportive.

01:57.833 --> 01:59.958
Thank you,
thank you, thank you!

01:59.958 --> 02:01.875
Thank you, thank you!

02:53.958 --> 02:57.083
Mom, Dad, Talia just
told me her parents
want to meet you guys

02:57.083 --> 02:58.833
so they can get
a sense of my family.

02:58.833 --> 03:01.875
I can't even make
sense of this family,

03:01.875 --> 03:03.333
how are they gonna do it?

03:04.625 --> 03:07.000
You know what's worse
than meeting parents?

03:07.000 --> 03:09.208
Meeting the kind of parents
that want to meet other parents.

03:10.500 --> 03:13.333
Yeah, you should just
put 'em off for a little while.

03:13.333 --> 03:15.208
All right, I'll put 'em off
for two hours.

03:15.208 --> 03:16.833
They're coming over for lunch.

03:16.833 --> 03:20.166
Oh, I hate
meeting new people.

03:20.166 --> 03:23.250
But I do like lunch.
It's... There's...

03:23.250 --> 03:25.375
I'm torn!

03:27.333 --> 03:30.166
Justin, I just heard
your sister's moving out.

03:30.166 --> 03:32.125
Now we can take over her room.

03:32.125 --> 03:36.958
"Operation: Sister's Moving Out
So We Can Take Over Her Room"
is in high gear.

03:36.958 --> 03:42.458
We're gonna have enough room
to build a plexi-dome
moonscape biosphere!

03:46.708 --> 03:51.291
I'm Harper's latest craft
project, Venus Paloma.

03:51.291 --> 03:53.875
Harper, please stop
playing with puppets.

03:53.875 --> 03:56.333
I'm trying to figure out
a way to make money.

03:56.333 --> 04:00.250
All right, what do we have
that people would pay for?

04:00.250 --> 04:03.875
That's a cute puppet.
Are you doing a show?

04:03.875 --> 04:05.500
Hey, quiet,
little girl!

04:05.500 --> 04:08.166
We're trying to think
of a way we can make money.

04:08.166 --> 04:10.083
Sorry, but I just
wanted to know

04:10.083 --> 04:11.875
where I can buy a ticket
for the puppet show.

04:11.875 --> 04:16.416
Kid, please!
Don't make me tell you again.

04:18.625 --> 04:22.875
Wait a minute! That puppet
lovin' little girl just
gave me an idea.

04:22.875 --> 04:25.583
We could make money by
putting on a puppet show!

04:25.583 --> 04:29.333
That's a terrific idea!
I'm ready to be a rock star!

04:29.333 --> 04:30.708
OK, then it's settled.

04:30.708 --> 04:32.833
You make another marionette,
and I'll write a script

04:32.833 --> 04:35.458
about two oddball friends
making their way in the world.

04:35.458 --> 04:38.958
OK, and we'll build the puppet
stage to make sure you move out.

04:47.625 --> 04:50.750
All right, guys, Talia's
parents are on their way up.

04:50.750 --> 04:52.708
So let me give you a tip,
so you have plenty
to talk about.

04:52.708 --> 04:55.833
- OK.
- They love the Mets and they
like going to the movie theater.

04:55.833 --> 04:58.458
Perfect. Your father
and I love that stuff.

04:58.458 --> 05:00.333
That's why we
get along so well.

05:00.333 --> 05:03.416
On Saturday afternoons,
I go to a ball game,

05:03.416 --> 05:06.291
and your mom goes
to a movie about feelings.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.333
All right, that's them.

05:16.625 --> 05:19.458
Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Robinson,
welcome to our home.

05:19.458 --> 05:22.708
These are my parents,
Theresa and Jerry.

05:22.708 --> 05:26.458
And these are my parents,
Rob and Meg.

05:26.458 --> 05:29.583
- Oh, so nice to meet you.
- Lovely to meet you.

05:29.583 --> 05:31.833
- Oh, come on in.
- Hi.

05:31.833 --> 05:33.416
- How you doing?
- Hi.

05:36.083 --> 05:38.583
Did you prep your parents?
This is really important.

05:38.583 --> 05:41.291
Yeah, I told them your parents
love the movies and the Mets.

05:41.291 --> 05:44.125
No! No, I said they like
going to the Met.

05:44.125 --> 05:45.958
Short for "Metropolitan
Opera House."

05:45.958 --> 05:47.708
And going
to the theater for plays.

05:47.708 --> 05:49.083
Oh, OK.

05:49.083 --> 05:50.583
Uh, they're not prepped
at all, then.

05:51.625 --> 05:53.708
So, Rob, Meg...

05:53.708 --> 05:58.083
We love the Mets so much.
How about you guys?

05:58.083 --> 05:59.875
We were just there
on Saturday.

05:59.875 --> 06:01.708
Just a splendid
production.

06:01.708 --> 06:03.875
Oh, when they beat
the Phillies?

06:03.875 --> 06:09.208
What? Someone got beaten
at the Metropolitan Opera House?

06:09.208 --> 06:12.416
No, no, I'm talking about
the baseball team, the Mets.

06:12.416 --> 06:14.500
But if someone got beaten
at the opera house...

06:14.500 --> 06:16.750
Ha-ha! I actually might go.

06:18.083 --> 06:19.375
Uh... To save them!

06:19.375 --> 06:21.958
My dad would go anywhere
to save an opera lover.

06:23.375 --> 06:25.166
We go to the opera
all the time.

06:25.166 --> 06:29.500
We place a ridiculously
high value on education
and cultural awareness.

06:31.125 --> 06:34.083
Yes, our family motto is,
"The more you know...

06:34.083 --> 06:36.000
...it's still
not enough."

06:37.750 --> 06:42.250
Obviously, the
Russos care about learning, too.

06:42.250 --> 06:45.250
I mean, look how many
books they have on...

06:45.250 --> 06:47.458
...reality show celebrities.

06:49.375 --> 06:51.875
See, the thing is,
we really don't get
to go to the opera often,

06:51.875 --> 06:54.708
'cause, you know, we're
too busy going to the movies.

06:54.708 --> 06:57.208
I have a feeling
you can relate to that.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.458
Actually, no, we don't
go to the movies.

07:01.458 --> 07:03.250
We prefer live theater.

07:03.250 --> 07:05.625
Well, we went
to the theater once,

07:07.416 --> 07:11.750
But, you know, the show
seemed to end, like, right
in the middle of the story.

07:11.750 --> 07:14.083
I didn't get it.

07:15.166 --> 07:17.000
That was the intermission.

07:18.125 --> 07:20.875
You see Jerry,
I told you there was more.

07:22.125 --> 07:24.125
You know?

07:24.125 --> 07:28.208
We don't think this is
an intellectually stimulating
environment for Talia.

07:28.208 --> 07:30.458
I don't even have to confer
with my wife on this.

07:32.000 --> 07:35.500
Perhaps it's best that Max
and Talia don't see each
other anymore.

07:35.500 --> 07:37.458
Well... hold on.

07:37.458 --> 07:39.583
You're saying we can't see each
other anymore because...

07:39.583 --> 07:42.625
...what, my parents don't go
to the opera house and they
like the wrong kind of Mets?

07:42.625 --> 07:45.000
We also don't like your books.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.958
Talia, let's go.

07:49.083 --> 07:51.583
- Mom, Dad, please...
- Talia, let's go.

07:54.083 --> 07:55.583
Talia, I tried.

07:56.500 --> 07:58.125
Goodbye, Max.

08:05.166 --> 08:07.708
All right,
sorry I'm late.

08:07.708 --> 08:10.500
I overslept and didn't have
a chance to write the script.

08:10.500 --> 08:14.500
But I am well-rested
so that... is good.

08:16.083 --> 08:18.875
Excuse me? You didn't
write the script?

08:18.875 --> 08:21.833
Don't worry, Harper,
we'll just wing it.

08:21.833 --> 08:23.333
Oh yeah, we'll just wing it.

08:23.333 --> 08:26.291
Yeah, you know, I made puppets,
they made a stage.

08:26.291 --> 08:30.000
We all did what we said we were
going to do, except for you.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.708
Don't you care
about us moving out?

08:31.708 --> 08:33.708
Of course I do, Harper.

08:33.708 --> 08:36.166
They're just kids.
They love anything you
put in front of them.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.166
Look, we'll just be, like,

08:39.166 --> 08:41.500
"Hello, puppet.
How are you?"

08:41.500 --> 08:45.083
You'll be, like, "Hello, puppet.
I'm good, how are you?"

08:45.083 --> 08:47.500
Right? Not bad,
huh, kids? Yeah?

08:50.083 --> 08:53.708
Sorry, kids. Show's canceled
due to laziness.

08:54.583 --> 08:56.708
Aww...

08:58.291 --> 09:00.250
- Wait a minute!
- There's no show?

09:00.250 --> 09:05.458
Zeke, you need to do something,
or we can kiss our plexi-dome
moonscape biosphere goodbye.

09:07.375 --> 09:09.250
Hey, kids!

09:09.250 --> 09:12.333
Puppet shows are great,
but you know what's better?

09:12.333 --> 09:14.875
Mimes! Whoa!

09:14.875 --> 09:16.708
Look, I can pull a rope!

09:18.708 --> 09:20.750
It goes on forever!

09:20.750 --> 09:24.208
Wow, how about a donation,
folks, huh?

09:24.208 --> 09:26.500
Come on, put some
money in the hat. Come on.

09:26.500 --> 09:28.250
Put your hat
back on, mister.

09:28.250 --> 09:31.625
I'm not a "mister,"
I am in my late teens!

09:32.708 --> 09:34.125
Way to go, Alex.

09:34.125 --> 09:36.458
Once again, you've earned
no money for our apartment.

09:36.458 --> 09:38.500
What are you so mad
about, Harper?

09:38.500 --> 09:40.625
We'll just figure out another
way to make money and move out.

09:40.625 --> 09:43.375
You don't
get it, do you?

09:43.375 --> 09:45.958
If I can't rely on you
for a simple puppet show,

09:45.958 --> 09:50.458
how could I ever rely on you
for something more important,
like sharing an apartment?

09:50.458 --> 09:52.250
I'm not moving out
with you, Alex.

09:52.250 --> 09:53.625
I'm moving out on my own.

10:07.458 --> 10:09.583
Max, you all right?

10:10.958 --> 10:13.166
I'm just writing Talia's
name on my arm in mustard.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
I really miss her.

10:18.583 --> 10:20.375
I'm sorry, man.

10:20.375 --> 10:22.000
Maybe I can help.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.458
OK, there's only one "L" and
you need an "A" at the end.

10:27.208 --> 10:30.625
Thanks, man, but there's
no point in me learning
to spell her name now.

10:30.625 --> 10:33.833
Mom and Dad didn't make
a good first impression
when they met her parents.

10:33.833 --> 10:36.416
Yeah, of course they didn't.
They don't im-press people,

10:36.416 --> 10:40.125
- they de-press people.
- I just...

10:40.125 --> 10:43.708
I just wish there was
a way that they could meet
all over again, you know?

10:43.708 --> 10:45.333
Hold on...

10:45.333 --> 10:47.583
There is!

10:47.583 --> 10:49.708
You could use
the "clean slate" spell,

10:49.708 --> 10:52.583
so Talia's parents don't
remember meeting our parents.

10:52.583 --> 10:54.458
- Really?
- Yes.

10:54.458 --> 10:58.166
Wow, you're usually not the one
telling me to use magic to fix
my problems.

10:58.166 --> 11:02.000
I know. But, I do know
what it's like

11:02.000 --> 11:04.875
to have loved
and lost a girl.

11:04.875 --> 11:06.458
Twice.

11:07.583 --> 11:09.125
And then another girl.

11:10.875 --> 11:12.958
And I don't want that
to happen to you.

11:12.958 --> 11:14.458
Does the spell work
through the phone?

11:14.458 --> 11:16.208
All spells work
through the phone now.

11:16.208 --> 11:18.250
It's not 1991.

11:18.250 --> 11:20.375
All right,
I'm calling the Robinsons.

11:29.083 --> 11:32.208
Rob Robinson speaking.

11:32.208 --> 11:36.416
Hi, um... Is your wife
in the room with you
by any chance?

11:36.416 --> 11:39.458
Yes, she's in the middle
of practicing her violin...

11:39.458 --> 11:41.708
...but I'd be
happy to interrupt her.

11:43.208 --> 11:45.416
OK, do it now!

11:45.416 --> 11:46.708
Robinsons and Russos,
clean the slate,

11:46.708 --> 11:48.375
meet again
and change your fate!

11:50.833 --> 11:54.291
All right. Now I guess
I just call back and invite
the Robinsons over.

11:57.416 --> 12:02.708
Meg Robinson speaking.

12:02.708 --> 12:06.708
Hello, Meg. This is
Theresa Russo, Max's mother.

12:08.583 --> 12:11.500
Ooh, hi, Mrs. Russo.

12:11.500 --> 12:15.250
Do you have a cold?
You sound like a teenage boy.

12:16.583 --> 12:17.708
Thank you.

12:19.083 --> 12:22.208
Listen, why don't you guys
come over around six tonight?

12:22.208 --> 12:24.375
Jerry and I think it's
about time we met you guys.

12:24.375 --> 12:27.875
Ooh, I'd have to cancel
my violin lesson...

12:27.875 --> 12:30.000
Oh, I'll make sure that happens.
We'll be there.

12:32.500 --> 12:34.750
Hello, Annie. I'm home.

12:34.750 --> 12:37.583
I bought us groceries
for our new apartment.

12:37.583 --> 12:40.500
Cool. Just put 'em
in the cooking room.

12:40.500 --> 12:43.708
These bags are heavy.

12:43.708 --> 12:46.333
- Can you help?
- Sure, I'll help you.

12:47.583 --> 12:50.333
Whew,
I'm exhausted!

12:51.708 --> 12:53.291
I'm gonna lay down
and take a nap.

12:53.291 --> 12:55.458
But you didn't
even help me.

12:55.458 --> 12:58.416
Well, you know
how unreliable I am.

12:58.416 --> 13:01.083
I can't even carry
my own weight.

13:02.458 --> 13:06.208
Yeah, that's why I'm a hero
for just being friends with you.

13:06.208 --> 13:07.416
The end!

13:11.250 --> 13:14.125
Oh, thank you, guys.
Thanks for coming to the show.

13:14.125 --> 13:16.583
Oh, I see it's allowance week,
Jimmy. Thank you.

13:17.500 --> 13:19.375
That Annie didn't
lift a finger.

13:19.375 --> 13:20.625
Right?

13:20.625 --> 13:22.833
- Hey, guys.
- Harper, great show!

13:22.833 --> 13:25.291
where did you come up
with all these characters
out of thin air?

13:25.291 --> 13:28.500
Annie really reminded me
of somebody. Just...

13:28.500 --> 13:33.000
Really, you couldn't tell
that that was a thinly-veiled
attack on Alex?

13:34.166 --> 13:35.458
I could tell.

13:39.500 --> 13:41.500
She reminded me of Alex!

13:50.333 --> 13:52.500
So you want us to meet
the Robinsons all over?

13:52.500 --> 13:55.458
Wait, weren't we humiliated
enough the first time?

13:56.875 --> 13:59.708
Dad, Talia is my first real
girlfriend, all right?

13:59.708 --> 14:01.166
And you guys ruined it.

14:01.166 --> 14:03.708
You gave us terrible
information.

14:04.875 --> 14:06.500
And you listened to me.

14:06.500 --> 14:08.166
Which some people
would say is worse.

14:10.083 --> 14:12.625
Look, Justin did a spell
so her parents don't
remember any of it.

14:12.625 --> 14:15.583
What do you say?
Come on, Ma, Jerry...

14:15.583 --> 14:17.500
Wanna give this another shot?

14:17.500 --> 14:21.000
I don't think so, Max.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.958
Great, that's them.
Let's do this!

14:22.958 --> 14:25.333
OK, fine.

14:27.458 --> 14:28.750
- Hi.
- Hello.

14:28.750 --> 14:32.291
- Oh, hello.
- Hi, I'm Meg Robinson.
My husband, Rob.

14:32.291 --> 14:35.625
It's so nice to finally
meet Max's parents.

14:35.625 --> 14:37.125
Yes, so nice to meet you, too.

14:37.125 --> 14:38.750
You know, we've talked
about it so much,

14:38.750 --> 14:41.375
I feel like we've
already met you.

14:41.375 --> 14:43.625
- Come on in.
- Hello.

14:43.625 --> 14:45.625
Hi, Rob, I'm Jerry.

14:45.625 --> 14:49.583
Those calluses on my hands are
not from me playing baseball,

14:49.583 --> 14:51.500
but they're from me...

14:51.500 --> 14:53.500
...rubbing my chin
while thinking.

14:55.125 --> 14:57.625
Yes, um, my dad does
a lot of thinking.

14:57.625 --> 15:00.708
He was on the thinking team
back in college.

15:00.708 --> 15:02.583
You know what I'm
thinking about right now?

15:02.583 --> 15:05.958
A book I'm reading
about the Met.

15:05.958 --> 15:09.750
Not the baseball team,
the Mets.

15:09.750 --> 15:14.083
I bet there's some
culturally unaware people
that might confuse the two.

15:18.125 --> 15:21.458
Sometimes I have to force Jerry
to stop reading about the Met

15:21.458 --> 15:23.375
before we go to the Met.

15:23.375 --> 15:26.333
We like the opera so much
more than the movies.

15:26.333 --> 15:29.166
That's nice.
What's your favorite opera?

15:29.166 --> 15:31.583
Her favorite opera is Winfrey.

15:35.250 --> 15:38.000
What? Opera Winfrey, Ma.
You watch it every day.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.125
He's kidding.

15:40.125 --> 15:41.125
Ha-ha-ha!

15:41.125 --> 15:42.625
I have an idea.

15:42.625 --> 15:45.500
Let's all go see
Wagner'sThe Ring.

15:45.500 --> 15:47.000
It's playing
at the Met tonight.

15:47.000 --> 15:50.333
Oh, that would be wonderful!

15:52.333 --> 15:54.208
Pardon me for interrupting
this great time,

15:54.208 --> 15:56.416
but is it OK if I
still see your daughter?

15:56.416 --> 15:58.958
Absolutely.

15:58.958 --> 16:03.125
This is obviously a
culturally stimulating
environment for Talia.

16:03.125 --> 16:05.708
We haven't found anyone
else's parents

16:05.708 --> 16:09.458
to be sophisticated enough
to sit through 16 hours
ofThe Ring.

16:09.458 --> 16:12.125
What?

16:14.125 --> 16:16.000
Sixteen hours?

16:16.000 --> 16:21.000
Yes. Ah, I wish
it were longer, too.

16:21.000 --> 16:26.625
Oh... this is gonna be
a great evening!

16:26.625 --> 16:29.333
So fun!

16:29.333 --> 16:33.375
In 17 hours,
I am so gonna get you.

16:45.333 --> 16:48.875
Harper is still out there
making tons of money
making fun of me.

16:48.875 --> 16:52.875
But I will say that that Annie
has an undeniable charm.

16:52.875 --> 16:55.458
Alex, You need to make things
right with Harper,

16:55.458 --> 16:59.833
so I can fulfill my dream and
building a plexi-dome moonscape
biosphere in your room.

17:02.208 --> 17:05.250
All right, where should I put
the dual power generator?

17:08.000 --> 17:11.333
This is gonna be how
we generate electricity
in the biosphere.

17:11.333 --> 17:13.625
Hit it!

17:13.625 --> 17:16.125
See Alex, Zeke and I
can work together.

17:16.125 --> 17:18.166
Why can't you and Harper?
I can't breathe.

17:19.875 --> 17:23.083
Well, Harper and I don't
need to work together.

17:23.083 --> 17:26.583
I'm going to do my own show
and move out by myself.

17:26.583 --> 17:28.583
But you don't know
how to make marionettes.

17:28.583 --> 17:30.458
Oh, yes I do.

17:30.458 --> 17:33.708
Turn this clever spell-caster
into Alex, the puppet master.

17:33.708 --> 17:34.875
Oh, no! That sounds
like a spell!

17:38.375 --> 17:42.416
Hey, I did not agree
to be turned into a puppet!

17:42.416 --> 17:45.583
Oh, these lederhosen
are way nicer than mine.

17:49.708 --> 17:51.750
It's showtime.

17:55.750 --> 17:58.750
Annie, it's time
to get out of bed.

17:58.750 --> 18:01.083
I only get up on weekends!

18:07.583 --> 18:09.250
I'm gonna need a stage.

18:11.583 --> 18:14.833
Build a puppet stage
to earn a hefty wage.

18:19.083 --> 18:21.708
Hey, everybody! Come check out
this marionette show.

18:21.708 --> 18:24.416
You're gonna
like it so much better.

18:30.333 --> 18:31.875
Lady, please help me.

18:31.875 --> 18:34.166
I'm being forced to do this
against my will.

18:37.875 --> 18:39.875
Zeke! Just do
the show, man.

18:39.875 --> 18:41.250
Do it for us.

18:41.250 --> 18:43.708
Do it for the plexi-dome
moonscape biosphere.

18:43.708 --> 18:45.375
Now, come on,
let's dance.

18:45.375 --> 18:47.208
The people love it.

18:55.416 --> 18:57.875
Come on. Dance, Zeke!

18:57.875 --> 19:01.125
Stop! Must...
resist... the strings.

19:03.208 --> 19:04.958
Everybody stop!
Don't go!

19:04.958 --> 19:06.333
There's more!

19:06.333 --> 19:09.000
Heather is about to accuse
Annie of being selfish,

19:09.000 --> 19:11.458
irresponsible, and
of stealing her audience.

19:11.458 --> 19:13.333
All right, we get it.

19:13.333 --> 19:14.875
Annie's the cool one.

19:17.166 --> 19:19.500
Justin, Zeke is resisting.

19:19.500 --> 19:22.500
Just...Just turn him around
and I'll kick him into helping.

19:26.875 --> 19:28.458
Oh, stop it! Stop!

19:28.458 --> 19:30.458
I am not stopping
until you do the show!

19:34.750 --> 19:38.125
Stop, stop! Please stop!
I'll do it. All right,
I'll do it!

19:39.708 --> 19:41.083
- I'm out of here.
- Zeke!

19:45.583 --> 19:47.458
I'm not your puppet!

19:49.083 --> 19:50.583
Zeke!

19:50.583 --> 19:52.625
What about our biosphere?

19:58.708 --> 20:01.083
Remote control marionettes.
How 'bout that?

20:01.083 --> 20:04.500
Now that's a show!
Pay her, Mom.

20:05.958 --> 20:07.375
Thank you!

20:08.583 --> 20:09.708
Thank you.

20:12.458 --> 20:14.166
Thank you so much.

20:17.208 --> 20:18.875
Congratulations, Alex.

20:20.166 --> 20:22.000
It looks like you're the one
who gets to move out.

20:36.958 --> 20:40.583
It's the Annie
and Heather Show. Yay!

20:42.833 --> 20:46.333
When we last left them,
they were in the middle
of an ugly argument

20:46.333 --> 20:50.166
about irresponsible Annie
with a heart of gold.

20:51.625 --> 20:53.458
Look, Heather,
I made tons of dough,

20:53.458 --> 20:55.208
so we can get an apartment.

20:55.208 --> 20:57.583
I'm not gonna
move out without you.

20:57.583 --> 21:00.083
Aw, Annie, you're not perfect,

21:00.083 --> 21:02.833
but you usually come through
after a bad situation.

21:02.833 --> 21:05.416
We're best friends forever.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.708
Seriously, we are.

21:10.708 --> 21:12.416
I know!

21:12.416 --> 21:14.583
But I can't wait
for bad things to happen

21:14.583 --> 21:16.583
for you decide
to do the right thing.

21:16.583 --> 21:18.750
I have to be able
to count on you.

21:20.458 --> 21:22.416
That sounds like a warning,

21:22.416 --> 21:24.708
like we're gonna be
living together.

21:26.333 --> 21:28.166
Promise you'll pull
your own weight?

21:28.166 --> 21:30.333
- I promise.
- And respect the chore chart?

21:30.333 --> 21:31.458
And... Chore chart?

21:32.833 --> 21:35.416
- Only if you respect
my sleeping chart.
- No.

21:35.416 --> 21:38.416
All right, I didn't want
to go through the trouble
of making a chart anyway.

21:38.416 --> 21:39.958
It's a deal.

21:46.333 --> 21:48.333
They didn't
see us, did they?

21:48.333 --> 21:50.375
No, no,
we got out clean.

21:50.375 --> 21:54.166
What kind of language is that?
And how can anybody follow it?

21:54.166 --> 21:56.375
Hey, what's going on?

21:56.375 --> 21:58.583
You guys are supposed
to be at the opera
with Talia's parents.

21:58.583 --> 22:00.625
We snuck out!

22:00.625 --> 22:03.458
Yeah, we're gonna go
upstairs, take a nap,

22:03.458 --> 22:05.416
then get something to eat,
and sneak back in.

22:05.416 --> 22:07.458
- They'll never know.
- Don't you think they'll notice

22:07.458 --> 22:09.166
when the lights come
up for intermission?

22:10.833 --> 22:13.375
That's right,
there's an intermission!

22:13.375 --> 22:17.208
Oh, Jerry,
we have to go back.

22:17.208 --> 22:18.416
Come on.

22:20.875 --> 22:23.416
I'm still gonna
get you in 13 hours.

22:24.708 --> 22:27.250
Hi, Talia, how are...
Oh, that's cute!

22:27.250 --> 22:29.083
Clean that up!
