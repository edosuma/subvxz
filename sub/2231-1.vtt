01:12.072 --> 01:13.915
- Hey, Sam!
- Hi, Larry.

01:13.991 --> 01:15.368
Morning!

01:52.779 --> 01:54.156
Ready?

01:55.073 --> 01:56.416
Trainee!

02:12.716 --> 02:14.059
Welcome to UMart.

02:16.720 --> 02:20.020
Easy now. Easy. Easy. Try this, right here.

02:20.557 --> 02:22.059
Oh!

02:22.601 --> 02:25.024
But they're not... Actually, Mr Avery!

02:25.228 --> 02:27.856
- How much does this go for?
- $279.69

02:28.106 --> 02:29.858
$279.69

02:30.859 --> 02:36.072
That was a wild ride from this horsey
for that little pickle bug! Wasn't it?

02:36.073 --> 02:39.168
- I am so sorry.
- No, I understand.

02:39.242 --> 02:42.792
This happens all the time,
but it's usually the helicopter.

03:03.308 --> 03:04.935
Ah!

03:12.651 --> 03:16.701
You zone the entire depot, every rack,
before you punch out.

03:16.780 --> 03:19.033
It's not just policy.
It's the right thing to do.

03:22.119 --> 03:23.996
- What'd they say?
- You have to listen twice.

03:24.079 --> 03:26.457
<i>Larry Crowne to the
common break area.</i>

03:27.332 --> 03:29.380
"Larry Crowne to the common break area"?

03:29.459 --> 03:32.178
Yeah, that's what I heard. I wonder why.

03:33.004 --> 03:34.839
It's Employee of the Month day.

03:34.840 --> 03:37.593
Spectacular!

03:37.718 --> 03:39.436
How many will this be?

03:39.553 --> 03:41.851
Oh, I'm not saying. Nine.

03:42.806 --> 03:45.980
Larry Crowne on deck, as ordered.

03:46.309 --> 03:48.983
Hey, Vicky, where were you
in Alvarez' baby pool?

03:49.062 --> 03:52.022
I had last week. What a dope.

03:52.023 --> 03:54.651
Front office personnel are recommended
to leave the employee pools

03:54.776 --> 03:57.074
to the hourly staff, Larry. You know that.

03:57.154 --> 03:59.577
That's too bad.
You could've won a hundred bucks.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.663
Cubby, make tracks, please.

04:01.742 --> 04:04.541
Oh, I'm sorry. I was just taking a break
in the common break area.

04:04.995 --> 04:08.249
You know, I think I know
what this is about.

04:08.665 --> 04:10.499
I don't think you do.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.377
- Crowne...
- Mmm.

04:13.253 --> 04:16.803
There's been a restructuring ordered
throughout the UMart nation.

04:16.964 --> 04:19.507
Now, "restructuring" is their word.

04:19.509 --> 04:21.226
<i>Ask me, it's a pain in the tuchis.</i>

04:21.303 --> 04:23.055
<i>That's right, isn't it,
tuchis, where you get kicked?</i>

04:23.138 --> 04:24.513
- A Yiddish word, yeah.
- Absolutely.

04:24.514 --> 04:26.687
<i>- It's like the buttocks.
- Tuchis and buttocks, synonymous.</i>

04:26.767 --> 04:30.227
Well, it hurts when you get kicked back there
no matter what language you're speaking.

04:30.228 --> 04:31.730
You bet.

04:31.813 --> 04:33.156
Larry,

04:33.899 --> 04:38.575
I'm sorry, but we've come to a parting
of the ways, UMart and you.

04:43.533 --> 04:44.910
Miss Hurley will explain.

04:44.911 --> 04:47.870
UMart's policy is to never limit
the opportunities of our employees,

04:47.871 --> 04:51.040
no matter their race, gender,
age, sexual orientation.

04:51.041 --> 04:53.043
It's all published on the website.

04:53.168 --> 04:56.047
A mandatory review of the records
of all team leaders has revealed

04:56.129 --> 04:58.882
that you never matriculated
to a university or college.

04:59.049 --> 05:01.768
That makes you a 4
on the advancement scale of 1 to 4,

05:01.843 --> 05:03.937
4 being the least recommended.

05:04.012 --> 05:08.392
You're limited in your opportunities
for all further advancement corporate-wide,

05:08.475 --> 05:10.227
and that's something UMart does not do.

05:10.228 --> 05:13.231
That's, uh, something UMart does not do.

05:13.688 --> 05:16.282
Well, this sounds like you're firing me.

05:18.109 --> 05:19.986
See, Larry, here's the problem.

05:20.070 --> 05:22.072
Your lack of educational background

05:22.155 --> 05:25.034
is gonna forever retard your movement
up the UMart ladder.

05:25.200 --> 05:29.205
You're forever retarded, Crowne,
'cause you didn't go to college.

05:29.287 --> 05:32.837
SMU. Class of '86. That's solid gold, man.

05:32.916 --> 05:34.509
They just don't give those away.

05:34.584 --> 05:36.632
Three years, Chico State.

05:38.463 --> 05:41.683
So, that's why everybody's
made front office except me?

05:41.925 --> 05:43.472
You and I
went head-to-head, Larry.

05:43.760 --> 05:46.604
I mean, who'd have thought
I'd get promoted over you?

05:48.306 --> 05:51.475
I chose the Navy
right out of high school.

05:51.476 --> 05:53.069
I did almost 20 years.

05:53.228 --> 05:55.771
Weren't you a cook?

05:55.772 --> 05:58.150
We'd like to thank you for your service
to the nation, Larry,

05:58.151 --> 06:01.028
and, frankly, in all seriousness,
for your service to UMart, too,

06:01.111 --> 06:03.113
but that's over with now.

06:04.614 --> 06:06.787
Absolutely. Hey, ho, hey, pizza left.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.619
- One slice. Anybody want it?
- No.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.295
Larry?

06:10.704 --> 06:14.584
No. No. No, no, no. No, no, no.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.002
Listen, please, please,
don't, I cannot be fired.

06:18.003 --> 06:21.803
These last couple years
have just been a bloodbath.

06:22.048 --> 06:23.641
I mean, I have really taken a beating.

06:23.717 --> 06:27.845
Hey, we've all gotten our clocks cleaned
by our ex-wives. Am I right?

06:27.846 --> 06:30.645
Larry, the timing on something like this
is always a bitch.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.359
It's always a bitch.

06:36.897 --> 06:39.650
I thought I was gonna be
Employee of the Month.

06:41.109 --> 06:43.077
Well, in a way, you are.

07:36.623 --> 07:40.548
According to your website,
the position is still open.

07:40.627 --> 07:43.879
So, once again,
this is Larry Crowne with an "E"

07:43.880 --> 07:46.715
calling in regards to any possible

07:46.716 --> 07:51.062
retail sales or management position.

07:51.638 --> 07:54.858
It's been filled? Thank you.

08:23.294 --> 08:26.969
Hello! You have got to be the manager,
am I right?

08:45.400 --> 08:46.822
- Wish I could help.
- Yeah.

08:46.901 --> 08:49.905
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thanks. Thanks anyway.
Times are tough.

08:50.947 --> 08:52.949
Tell me about it.

08:55.618 --> 08:58.497
I'm pointing out that
with very little effort

08:58.580 --> 09:01.754
you can still pay off that 392 K you owe.

09:02.667 --> 09:04.795
No, I can't.

09:04.961 --> 09:07.555
And I was told refinancing
would always be possible.

09:08.715 --> 09:11.343
Well, three years ago,

09:11.426 --> 09:16.847
I would have given you half a
million dollars on your signature.

09:16.848 --> 09:18.307
But things change.

09:18.308 --> 09:23.610
You're now unemployed, and your house
isn't worth what you still owe.

09:25.982 --> 09:29.862
Mr Crowne, I'm gonna get you
some complimentary coffee,

09:29.944 --> 09:33.030
and we have a lot of good things
to talk about.

09:33.031 --> 09:34.499
Lots of good things.

09:34.866 --> 09:38.291
First on the agenda is
liquidating your assets.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.548
No! Oh, no! No, no, no, no!

09:46.169 --> 09:47.842
What the hell are you doing?

09:48.004 --> 09:52.100
Larry Crowne, there has been a yard sale
at 8642 Derby Court

09:52.175 --> 09:54.223
since Lionel Richie was
dancing on the ceiling.

09:54.302 --> 09:56.600
That means I have a monopoly
on this location.

09:56.679 --> 09:59.523
You go yard on me,
I will have to take you down.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.898
Lamar, I lost my job.

10:02.185 --> 10:04.279
No. You got fired?

10:05.146 --> 10:06.773
- Yes.
- When?

10:08.066 --> 10:09.488
Last Friday.

10:11.027 --> 10:14.873
That's how they do it. On a bloody Friday.

10:15.573 --> 10:17.291
Security walks you out.

10:17.909 --> 10:21.880
Come Monday, the fired man
is the forgotten man. It's diabolical.

10:22.497 --> 10:24.875
They said it's because I
didn't go to college.

10:24.958 --> 10:28.303
And you believed that?
The Man wanted you gone.

10:28.628 --> 10:31.922
Look at my skin color.
I know what I'm talking about.

10:31.923 --> 10:33.550
So, you going on unemployment?

10:35.093 --> 10:36.561
If I have to.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.721
That's not gonna be enough
to cover your nut.

10:39.722 --> 10:43.100
Taking a loan out to buy out
Denise's half of the house,

10:43.101 --> 10:45.103
- that was a bad idea.
- Huh!

10:45.562 --> 10:47.896
I told you how to avoid divorce lawyers.

10:47.897 --> 10:50.776
You get married and you stay married.

10:51.693 --> 10:53.240
Come on.

10:53.570 --> 10:55.743
Come with me. Come on.

10:59.951 --> 11:01.910
Hey, B'Ella. Got anything new?

11:01.911 --> 11:04.084
Ooh, Larry! Dance lessons from the '50s.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.962
You don't have any of these, I promise.

11:06.040 --> 11:09.260
He can't afford them. He lost his job.
They let him go.

11:09.669 --> 11:12.013
- Oh, Larry. I'm so sorry.
- Yeah.

11:12.088 --> 11:14.261
And we gonna get him something better
than a job.

11:14.340 --> 11:15.933
- An education.
- Oh!

11:16.634 --> 11:18.853
Get you some knowledge
and you'll be fireproof.

11:18.928 --> 11:22.228
Oh, yeah, that's right, Larry.
You're never too old to learn.

11:22.432 --> 11:25.481
Just listen to my husband.
He hasn't called The Man boss in years.

11:25.560 --> 11:26.937
Oh, yeah, I remember why.

11:31.774 --> 11:34.323
Yeah! Yeah! I won! I won!

11:36.571 --> 11:38.744
Whoo! I won all this money!

11:40.491 --> 11:44.337
Well, Uncle Sam took his half.
That's gonna be 50 cents for the book.

11:45.955 --> 11:47.456
They give these away for free.

11:47.457 --> 11:49.209
Well, they do. I don't.

11:49.834 --> 11:52.087
- Ten cents.
- Four dimes, two nickels.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.634
- Twelve cents.
- Half a buck.

11:54.005 --> 11:56.679
- Seventeen cents.
- One dollar and I'll take half off.

11:56.799 --> 11:58.142
Keep it.

11:58.301 --> 12:00.395
Larry, okay, 35 cents, Larry.

12:27.580 --> 12:30.174
Dave Busik, Dean of Student Services.

12:30.458 --> 12:32.756
Oh. Larry Crowne.

12:32.835 --> 12:35.554
Nice to meet you, Larry.
Back to college, huh?

12:35.630 --> 12:37.849
No, no, this is the first time ever for me.

12:37.924 --> 12:39.801
I was in the Navy for 20 years.

12:40.051 --> 12:42.895
Coast Guard. Adventure of a lifetime.

12:44.013 --> 12:45.356
I was a cook.

12:45.890 --> 12:47.938
Culinary specialist.

12:48.017 --> 12:51.353
We teach a whole track
in hotel and restaurant food preparation.

12:51.354 --> 12:53.522
Oh, no, no, no, no, I did that long enough.

12:53.523 --> 12:57.903
Then I got into a whole different
line of work, until I was downsized.

12:58.778 --> 13:00.872
I'm here to make sure
that never happens again.

13:01.197 --> 13:03.825
Say, did you ever think about studying
tai chi?

13:04.242 --> 13:07.121
- No, sir.
- Cured my diabetes, no lie.

13:08.037 --> 13:11.041
I recommend Speech 217.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.751
"The Art of Informal Remarks. "

13:14.752 --> 13:18.046
"From toasts to job interviews,
Speech 217 will teach you

13:18.047 --> 13:20.257
how to communicate
with ease and confidence. "

13:20.258 --> 13:21.760
This class'll change your life.

13:22.969 --> 13:24.642
And you'll like the teacher.

13:26.180 --> 13:28.603
You ready to go to work? How about this?

13:28.683 --> 13:31.601
- Speech 217, Econ 1...
- You bet.

13:31.602 --> 13:34.271
- ... Composition 1. You learn how to talk.
- Right.

13:34.272 --> 13:36.695
You learn how to do business, and you
learn how to write about it.

13:36.774 --> 13:39.869
Three classes, but you're gonna
have to get in there, work.

14:01.716 --> 14:04.344
I'm telling you,
every cop has to stop me, man.

14:05.595 --> 14:07.438
Well, maybe
it's the leather jacket.

14:08.973 --> 14:11.192
- No, it's not.
- Talia gave me this jacket, man.

14:12.602 --> 14:14.149
She said I'd look like a brown James Dean.

14:16.147 --> 14:17.490
Who's James Dean?

14:32.205 --> 14:33.673
Hey! What's cooking there, Joe College?

14:33.748 --> 14:35.957
Can you get this hunk of junk working?

14:35.958 --> 14:38.802
I don't sell junk.
Let me get my good tools.

14:40.129 --> 14:44.009
Larry Crowne. You've got a lot of
money in those albums of yours.

14:44.092 --> 14:45.467
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

14:45.468 --> 14:47.812
They'll sell on the eBay.
I can show you how.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.685
You know this machine is a classic, right?

14:49.764 --> 14:52.563
Yeah, okay. But does it work?

14:52.642 --> 14:54.976
It will for $800.

14:54.977 --> 14:56.729
Oh, Lamar, I'm thinking like 200.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.278
Okay. 700.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.405
- 200.
- 650.

15:01.484 --> 15:03.578
- Gonna be a long day with those two.
- Mmm-hmm.

15:03.653 --> 15:05.155
- 630.
- 200.

15:05.238 --> 15:06.696
626.

15:06.697 --> 15:10.702
Lamar, I have no money.
I'm out of a job. $200.

15:10.785 --> 15:14.506
You're my neighbour.
625, and I'll throw in the oil change.

15:15.123 --> 15:16.466
I have an idea.

15:20.545 --> 15:25.096
Okay. This is a simple machine.
All right, this is your gas, your brake.

15:25.174 --> 15:27.222
I want you to put your foot on
that pedal down there.

15:27.223 --> 15:29.437
This is your starter button. Push that.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.650
Nice. You gonna need a special license.

15:34.767 --> 15:37.316
- How fast does it go?
- Oh, pretty...

15:37.687 --> 15:39.360
No, the brake, the brake!

15:39.480 --> 15:40.897
Larry!

15:40.898 --> 15:43.868
Sorry! Sorry!

15:45.486 --> 15:47.363
It's got power!

15:57.707 --> 15:59.505
<i>Please enter your...</i>

16:58.851 --> 17:02.151
What sin did you commit to have a class
at 8:00 a. m.?

17:02.230 --> 17:05.029
Earning a master's in comparative
political discourse

17:05.107 --> 17:08.276
in the plays of Shakespeare and Shaw. You?

17:08.277 --> 17:12.446
Well, I just started race-walking
at the track. It was fun.

17:12.448 --> 17:13.950
I hope I am never like that.

17:16.117 --> 17:19.996
When was the last time you looked at
your life and saw nothing but fraud?

17:19.997 --> 17:21.374
How long have you been teaching?

17:21.999 --> 17:23.467
I used to remember.

17:23.542 --> 17:25.170
You're right on time.

17:25.252 --> 17:29.349
I wonder if I make a dollop of difference
to anyone sitting in my classroom.

17:29.882 --> 17:34.262
We used to, until Facebook and Twitter killed
whatever attention span they had left.

17:36.305 --> 17:39.015
Well, it's 7:52.
Come on, we gotta get going.

17:39.016 --> 17:41.610
Off I go. On my way.

17:43.729 --> 17:45.572
Time for class.

18:04.625 --> 18:07.219
That's a damn fine Zipper, mister.

18:07.837 --> 18:10.807
It did get me here for a
nickel's worth of gas.

18:12.258 --> 18:14.431
Didn't see you in the
scooter pit last term.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.313
Oh, this is my first day of college, ever.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.023
I love that.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.478
You an ex-cop?

18:24.520 --> 18:26.989
No. Why would you think that?

18:27.398 --> 18:30.368
Tucking in a polo shirt makes you
look like one.

18:31.527 --> 18:33.200
And the glasses don't help.

18:33.279 --> 18:35.532
Well, no, I'm just a student.

18:36.198 --> 18:40.577
You don't happen to know where the Speech
and Communications Building is, do you?

18:40.578 --> 18:41.921
Didn't know there was one.

18:50.838 --> 18:52.260
This is it?

18:53.966 --> 18:56.469
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine.

18:56.636 --> 18:59.763
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine.

18:59.764 --> 19:02.057
My day has just been made.

19:02.058 --> 19:03.558
Excuse me?

19:03.559 --> 19:05.277
This class is canceled.

19:05.353 --> 19:08.653
The state charter requires a minimum of
10 students per class

19:08.731 --> 19:11.109
or else it costs more for us to be
here than not, so.

19:13.569 --> 19:16.948
I mean, did you really want a class
at 8:00 a. m.? I didn't.

19:17.698 --> 19:19.700
No. Okay, thanks, anyway.

19:21.285 --> 19:23.003
Is this Speech 217?

19:29.418 --> 19:31.921
See if you can find yourself a seat.

19:34.215 --> 19:38.345
My name is Miss Tainot,
T-A-I-N-O-T, Tainot.

19:38.427 --> 19:41.351
Not "Tie-knot". Tay-no.

19:55.820 --> 20:01.748
This is what you are going to learn
to do in my class.

20:07.081 --> 20:10.711
If you do not care about this class,
then neither do I.

20:11.627 --> 20:15.130
If you do not participate and show
up with enough sleep

20:15.131 --> 20:20.854
to make it through the 55 minutes,
three dawns a week, that I have to be here

20:21.303 --> 20:26.901
then you do not care about Speech 217,
the Art of Informal Remarks.

20:30.604 --> 20:31.981
So, get out.

20:32.606 --> 20:35.610
Get out, now! Go, right now! Go!

20:42.450 --> 20:46.202
It was worth a try. Well, when next we
meet, this is what we're gonna do.

20:46.203 --> 20:49.924
Each of you is going to address the class
for the first time.

20:49.999 --> 20:54.129
You will tell us how to do something
that you already know how to do.

20:58.174 --> 20:59.517
Miss Tie-knot?

21:02.219 --> 21:03.641
Uh, Tay-knot?

21:06.766 --> 21:08.143
Tae-Bo?

21:09.643 --> 21:11.020
Really?

21:12.354 --> 21:14.948
Who are you?

21:15.191 --> 21:20.448
Steve Dibiasi. D-I-B-I-A-S-I.

21:21.363 --> 21:24.742
Only two days before I gotta get up and
give my speech?

21:25.910 --> 21:27.708
You may be dreaming.

21:32.166 --> 21:34.214
Why are you here, Steve?

21:36.045 --> 21:39.891
Dean of Student Services said
your class would change my life.

21:45.054 --> 21:46.772
I gotta take this.

21:47.556 --> 21:50.400
Yo. Dude, I left it right there.

21:52.102 --> 21:55.572
In the cigar box, under the coffee
table, where it always is.

21:57.900 --> 21:59.447
<i>I didn't check there.</i>

21:59.610 --> 22:01.283
Repeat after me.

22:01.779 --> 22:03.404
Repeat.

22:03.405 --> 22:05.573
Steve cannot take calls right now.

22:05.574 --> 22:07.242
Steve can't take calls right now.

22:07.243 --> 22:10.292
He's learning to care.

22:10.371 --> 22:12.169
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

22:30.432 --> 22:33.481
Hi. We have Speech 217 together.

22:33.727 --> 22:35.604
Can you believe

22:35.688 --> 22:40.239
we have to get up and give a speech
in our very next class?

22:41.485 --> 22:43.362
Yeah. She scares me.

22:43.445 --> 22:46.540
- Oh, my God. Fancy this bit of destiny.
- Hello!

22:46.615 --> 22:50.159
I've been thinking about you
and I don't even know your name.

22:50.160 --> 22:53.630
Larry. Larry Crowne. Hi.

22:53.706 --> 22:55.379
This is, uh...

22:56.083 --> 22:58.302
- Lala.
- Lala.

22:58.961 --> 23:01.714
Larry and Lala. I don't think so.

23:02.464 --> 23:07.186
I used to be Kathryn, until I looked in
the mirror and saw a girl named Talia.

23:07.678 --> 23:09.555
My real name is Celestina.

23:09.638 --> 23:12.733
Celestina? How gorgeous.

23:15.477 --> 23:17.104
You.

23:19.523 --> 23:22.652
Lance. Lance Corona.

23:24.153 --> 23:26.531
- Wanna join my gang?
- You're in a gang?

23:26.614 --> 23:30.164
I hang with like-minded
scooter enthusiasts.

23:30.951 --> 23:32.294
Ugh!

23:33.203 --> 23:37.049
I'll give you a text, and you can do
some free-wheeling.

23:51.472 --> 23:56.979
You have entered Economics 1,
Econ Prime.

23:57.937 --> 24:02.659
Trying to make sense of the complicated
structure of economic law and theory?

24:03.692 --> 24:05.069
It's confusing

24:05.861 --> 24:08.489
until you read this course pack

24:09.281 --> 24:12.376
written by Ed Matsutani, Ph. D.

24:13.786 --> 24:16.039
That's me.

24:16.205 --> 24:21.803
Read this and follow me to economic
enlightenment and power.

24:38.185 --> 24:40.108
That usually scares people.

24:41.146 --> 24:43.569
Yet none of you have fled.

24:45.234 --> 24:47.657
A good economic indicator.

24:49.071 --> 24:50.368
Let us begin.

24:57.246 --> 24:58.919
Only four of you.

25:02.042 --> 25:03.544
This class is canceled.

25:20.477 --> 25:21.979
Let's see. Oh.

25:24.690 --> 25:26.315
Oh, hello.

25:26.316 --> 25:29.444
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:29.445 --> 25:31.447
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I likey, I likey.

25:32.281 --> 25:35.285
Hey! Who's home early, huh?

25:35.868 --> 25:38.121
Ophelia, out of the pond.

25:40.122 --> 25:42.295
First day of term calls for a celebration.

25:42.374 --> 25:44.001
You'd think so.

25:52.801 --> 25:54.223
Um...

25:55.179 --> 25:59.559
You know what? I built a flamethrower
of a posting for WarriorWeb,

25:59.641 --> 26:01.809
which, if I do say so myself,

26:01.810 --> 26:05.646
<i>would feed nicely as an outline for
Second Angel.</i>

26:05.647 --> 26:06.990
Good for you.

26:07.066 --> 26:11.321
Yeah, then I crushed 1,000 calories
at 24-Hour Fitness.

26:11.403 --> 26:13.155
You know no one's there after 9:00 a. m.?

26:13.822 --> 26:15.490
Go figure.

26:15.491 --> 26:18.040
After a smooth nap and a double espresso,

26:18.118 --> 26:22.294
man, I hit three hours of Blog and Talk
for CyberShare. Whoa.

26:24.666 --> 26:26.009
You don't believe me.

26:28.337 --> 26:29.839
Why wouldn't I believe you?

26:30.297 --> 26:35.098
I'm writing, Mercy. Look, this is what
I do, all day. That's what I do.

26:35.719 --> 26:37.187
Mmm.

26:37.638 --> 26:39.390
You're looking at porn.

26:40.682 --> 26:42.559
What?

26:43.268 --> 26:45.487
Oh!

26:47.689 --> 26:49.032
Fine!

26:49.108 --> 26:52.328
So, yeah, Thought Police, take me away.

26:52.402 --> 26:55.997
I saw some erotica. I'm a man, I admit it.

26:57.157 --> 26:58.534
Took you a while.

26:58.617 --> 27:02.588
Yeah, and it's not... it's barely porn.
And I'm not hiding it.

27:03.205 --> 27:04.878
Yes, you are.

27:05.958 --> 27:07.505
Everybody hides something.

27:10.379 --> 27:11.756
I have no secrets from you.

27:12.798 --> 27:16.884
I walk in that door and fill you in on
every high and low in my day.

27:16.885 --> 27:18.728
Today's low?

27:19.054 --> 27:21.933
A toss-up between a canceled Shakespeare

27:22.015 --> 27:24.564
and an Intro to Ren Lit with 20 heads

27:24.643 --> 27:27.988
who think the Renaissance is a fair
they go to every July.

27:28.313 --> 27:30.782
My high? I'm drinking it.

27:35.904 --> 27:37.406
Mmm-mmm.

27:37.865 --> 27:39.242
Mmm.

27:39.950 --> 27:41.418
Brain freeze.

27:42.244 --> 27:46.090
No secrets. It's perfection. That is you.

27:48.292 --> 27:50.590
It gets the bills paid.

27:51.128 --> 27:53.756
See, that's what you hide from me.

27:54.006 --> 27:55.849
I mean, you walk in the door pissed off
because...

27:55.924 --> 28:00.521
And I'm sorry, I have established
a beachhead in new media

28:00.596 --> 28:03.600
while you still teach at
Vassar of the Valley.

28:04.016 --> 28:07.020
And that is what you hide from me.

28:08.687 --> 28:11.691
You look at Bra Busters Triple-X,
hoping I don't know

28:11.773 --> 28:14.902
or don't care, but I do,
and I don't like it.

28:17.070 --> 28:21.792
You know, it may look like I don't work
hard around here, Mercy, but I do.

28:21.867 --> 28:25.497
I'm just a guy who is a guy being a guy
when you're not around.

28:29.958 --> 28:33.588
Oh, well, and walking away is great
for a relationship.

28:45.599 --> 28:49.479
I'm a guy who's
a guy being a guy!

28:50.229 --> 28:51.651
That's all!

28:57.236 --> 28:59.532
Everyone says that women's lacrosse
is not a real sport

28:59.533 --> 29:01.657
because you can't body check,
but that's just not true.

29:01.740 --> 29:03.868
If you want to get out your real
aggression before a game

29:03.869 --> 29:06.327
just check yourself against the wall.

29:06.328 --> 29:08.330
And then do 10 push-ups!

29:08.622 --> 29:14.379
Be aggressive! B-E aggressive!

29:14.920 --> 29:18.800
B-E A-G-G-R-E-S-S-I-V-E! Be aggressive!

29:21.009 --> 29:23.853
Thank you. Ladies lacrosse.

29:25.555 --> 29:28.980
I didn't realise. Uh, who's next?

29:30.519 --> 29:32.561
All right. I'll be the bad guy.

29:32.562 --> 29:34.030
Miss Crowne, please.

29:34.898 --> 29:36.400
You mean me?

29:37.067 --> 29:38.865
Mr Crowne, excuse me.

29:49.413 --> 29:50.756
Go.

29:50.831 --> 29:55.428
My presentation will be on the very
particular subject

29:56.378 --> 30:00.679
of how to prepare restaurant-quality
French toast.

30:01.383 --> 30:05.433
But don't worry, I'll speak in English.

30:08.473 --> 30:11.727
The key ingredients of restaurant-quality
French toast

30:11.935 --> 30:15.030
are bread, eggs

30:16.189 --> 30:18.738
milk, vanilla extract,

30:19.651 --> 30:22.029
oil or melted butter,

30:23.030 --> 30:25.032
cinnamon, nutmeg,

30:26.158 --> 30:29.583
powdered sugar and eggs.

30:33.123 --> 30:34.466
Ahead of myself here.

30:37.252 --> 30:39.254
A few words about syrups.

30:40.922 --> 30:43.550
Thank you. French toast.

30:47.346 --> 30:48.723
Direct and informative.

30:50.015 --> 30:52.643
Next, please.

30:52.851 --> 30:54.899
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! I got one now!

30:56.772 --> 30:58.149
You will dig it.

30:58.774 --> 31:00.151
Are you clairvoyant?

31:01.109 --> 31:03.282
No. Steve Dibiasi.

31:05.197 --> 31:07.291
<i>Testing, one,
two, three, testing.</i>

31:08.700 --> 31:10.828
<i>Toaster waffles, the easy breakfast.</i>

31:11.620 --> 31:14.464
<i>Put 'em in a toaster,
wait, pop 'em out.</i>

31:14.539 --> 31:16.837
<i>Eat 'em like a sandwich.</i>

31:16.917 --> 31:18.919
<i>No mess to clean up.</i>

31:22.506 --> 31:24.634
<i>Ding-ding! Applause, please!</i>

31:28.720 --> 31:30.814
He got that from...
That was my French toast.

31:32.015 --> 31:33.437
Who's next?

31:40.565 --> 31:44.365
<i>Well, my speech is on the five dance
steps every man should know.</i>

31:45.112 --> 31:47.911
<i>The first of which is the commonly
known two-step, so.</i>

31:53.995 --> 31:57.499
<i>And for the more advanced,
there's the butterfly.</i>

32:01.878 --> 32:04.848
As I said in chapter three

32:04.923 --> 32:08.848
the science of economics is a
relatively simple discipline

32:09.052 --> 32:11.100
told by hard numbers.

32:11.179 --> 32:15.150
Anyone who can add, subtract, multiply,
and divide can divine its truths.

32:16.685 --> 32:21.031
The social science of economics is told
by an ephemeral language.

32:21.106 --> 32:23.859
Contracts, quality differentials,

32:24.693 --> 32:31.042
pressure trends, the intangible
elements of the Individual Value Index.

32:32.701 --> 32:34.201
Us? Scoot?

32:34.202 --> 32:37.877
Subtle interpretation is required.

32:40.083 --> 32:41.460
Yeah. Why not?

32:41.543 --> 32:44.342
As is full concentration.

32:46.089 --> 32:48.057
Your device, please.

32:52.012 --> 32:57.018
They call them "smart phones", but only
dummies use them in my class.

32:58.518 --> 33:01.112
Let us begin with the quality differential.

33:02.647 --> 33:04.945
Like I don't
know a cop when I see one.

33:07.569 --> 33:09.196
My Dell Gordo.

33:13.533 --> 33:16.002
This is Lance Corona.

33:16.369 --> 33:18.918
Classmate and, so far, good guy.

33:20.207 --> 33:21.880
You gotta untuck the shirt, Lance.

33:22.250 --> 33:24.252
So, you wanna ride with us?

33:25.212 --> 33:26.805
Sure. Why not?

33:37.766 --> 33:40.565
Snap along, Lance, or you
can't join the gang.

33:58.662 --> 34:00.960
Okay, okay. You're in for a trial run.

35:06.146 --> 35:08.365
Hey! How you doing?

35:08.898 --> 35:11.572
Great! Where are we going?

35:12.444 --> 35:14.822
You know, we'll just ride around till
we get a bit hungry

35:15.530 --> 35:17.874
then maybe get a bite to eat.
You know a place?

35:17.949 --> 35:20.576
- Yeah, I know a place.
- Great! Show us!

35:20.577 --> 35:22.045
Follow me!

35:40.555 --> 35:42.398
- Frank's a good guy.
- We're both veterans.

35:42.474 --> 35:43.817
He did 20 years in the Marines.

35:44.225 --> 35:46.774
Hey, kid. You pump iron, don't you?

35:47.228 --> 35:48.400
What do you think?

35:48.521 --> 35:51.320
- I think you're wasting your time.
- Really?

35:51.441 --> 35:53.284
- Yeah, you should just do push-ups.
- Yeah?

35:53.360 --> 35:54.902
Yeah, you see this body here?

35:54.903 --> 35:58.077
One time, it was nothing
but a mass of chiselled muscle and bone.

35:58.657 --> 36:00.955
Really? What year was that?

36:02.160 --> 36:04.037
19-kiss-my-ass.

36:05.080 --> 36:08.050
I better get going. I have homework.

36:08.375 --> 36:09.752
No! We just got boosted.

36:09.834 --> 36:13.338
Yeah, you should come with us. We'll go
check out some junk shops, thrift stores.

36:13.421 --> 36:14.764
Would a yard sale do?

36:14.839 --> 36:17.968
I know a spectacular yard sale.
It's open every day.

36:18.593 --> 36:21.062
Then ye shall lead us, Lance Corona.

36:21.262 --> 36:22.639
Let's go.

36:22.972 --> 36:24.690
Frank, thanks very much!

36:24.766 --> 36:26.268
You're welcome, Larry. Take care.

36:36.778 --> 36:38.280
We're being invaded!

36:52.460 --> 36:56.135
Larry. What kind of thugs did you get
involved with?

36:56.464 --> 36:58.466
- Just my college buddies.
- College buddies?

37:01.970 --> 37:03.971
Whoa, hey, hey, kid, kid, you...

37:03.972 --> 37:07.192
TV trays. Postmodernism. That's art.

37:07.308 --> 37:09.476
It's a bargain at 100 bucks apiece.

37:09.477 --> 37:10.854
- For these?
- Yeah.

37:10.937 --> 37:13.315
Look, if you want them,
let's get to haggling.

37:13.648 --> 37:16.322
- A buck apiece.
- Ninety-nine.

37:16.568 --> 37:19.617
- Two bucks.
- Ninety-eight. See how this is working?

37:19.738 --> 37:21.991
Uh-huh. $2.25.

37:22.198 --> 37:25.577
$97.50, and, kid, I do this every day.

37:28.037 --> 37:29.630
No.

37:30.331 --> 37:31.674
No.

37:31.750 --> 37:35.220
These would look perfect on you.
And I think they'll fit.

37:35.295 --> 37:37.764
- Could be really cute.
- Ooh!

37:37.881 --> 37:41.101
I'm kidding with you.
Eight bucks and they're yours.

37:41.176 --> 37:43.176
- You almost went for it.
- Uh, no, I didn't, I didn't.

37:43.177 --> 37:45.522
$97.50, you were like,
"Whoa, that's a lot for TV trays,"

37:45.597 --> 37:47.691
but no, no,
not really, when you think about it.

37:53.897 --> 37:56.275
B'Ella says
he keeps his door unlocked.

37:56.357 --> 37:57.984
How trusting.

38:00.528 --> 38:03.197
So, this is where you disappeared to.

38:03.198 --> 38:04.541
It's so cluttered and dark.

38:04.616 --> 38:07.335
Lance, nothing but treasures next door.

38:08.286 --> 38:12.962
Oh, look. He's a man, and he lives alone.

38:13.208 --> 38:15.375
Are you two walking in
on all the neighbours?

38:15.376 --> 38:17.879
Sal cuts hair and she's gonna tackle yours.

38:18.046 --> 38:20.720
- She is?
- Yes, Lance. You need a haircut.

38:20.799 --> 38:22.676
Where's your bathroom?

38:22.801 --> 38:24.553
Uh, back through the bedroom.

38:24.761 --> 38:27.014
Well, come on. First one's free.

38:28.431 --> 38:31.685
How can you breathe with all this stuff?

38:32.227 --> 38:35.106
I usually straighten up on weekends.
I've been busy.

38:35.230 --> 38:37.153
Just go see Sal.

38:38.233 --> 38:40.156
I'm gonna need some muscle here.

38:42.695 --> 38:44.117
So, what is going on out there?

38:44.906 --> 38:48.501
Just introducing you
to a little thing called feng shui.

38:49.869 --> 38:52.418
Just gonna get rid of some of
this clutter here, okay?

38:52.580 --> 38:54.582
Yeah, just, you know, don't go crazy.

38:54.749 --> 38:57.047
Let Talia do her thing.
Okay? Life is easier.

39:04.175 --> 39:06.553
Well, I did everything I could.

39:09.806 --> 39:12.099
Nice.

39:12.100 --> 39:14.273
Now I see the Lance of my dreams.

39:15.311 --> 39:17.279
Mr Lance Corona.

39:18.439 --> 39:20.862
Raise your right hand.
Say something patriotic.

39:22.402 --> 39:25.076
We'll be right back after these messages.

39:25.780 --> 39:27.782
Welcome to the Street Patrol.

39:28.449 --> 39:31.202
We ride for justice and beauty.

39:31.286 --> 39:32.953
It's a full-time job, Lance.

39:32.954 --> 39:36.458
Hey, Lance, remember to bring the sides
forward, pat down the back.

39:38.418 --> 39:40.546
You are way cooler than you appear.

39:42.380 --> 39:45.725
Well, you know, sometimes it just comes
down to a good haircut.

39:45.800 --> 39:48.019
- Thank you!
- Had to be done, Lance!

39:52.140 --> 39:53.687
Oh, Lance.

39:54.100 --> 39:56.944
You know, every man falls
in love with Talia.

39:57.020 --> 40:00.115
And you will, too, if you haven't already.

40:02.066 --> 40:05.491
But I love her the mostest.
Know that right now.

40:06.696 --> 40:08.664
Seriously, don't make me
keep my eyes on you.

40:08.665 --> 40:11.660
- What's your real name, Lance?
- Larry Crowne, with an "E".

40:11.826 --> 40:14.045
Don Gordon, with a "G".

40:14.579 --> 40:16.001
Shake hands.

40:16.581 --> 40:18.003
Look each other in the eyes.

40:20.418 --> 40:23.843
Firm grips. No contest, but firm.

40:25.340 --> 40:26.808
Hold it.

40:27.216 --> 40:28.684
Stack it.

40:31.387 --> 40:32.889
One word, Lance,

40:33.890 --> 40:35.312
peace.

40:35.683 --> 40:37.060
Peace, indeed.

40:47.946 --> 40:49.539
Spectacular!

40:50.198 --> 40:51.825
Spectacular!

40:53.451 --> 40:55.419
So, this is feng shui.

41:01.668 --> 41:03.420
Hi, Larry!

41:03.878 --> 41:06.381
Pennies per mile, Lamar! Pennies!

41:07.048 --> 41:09.642
I told you that machine was a classic!

41:09.842 --> 41:11.719
I think he got me on that deal.

41:13.012 --> 41:15.435
♫ I've treacle and toffee

41:15.436 --> 41:18.058
♫ I've tea and I've coffee

41:18.059 --> 41:21.654
♫ Soft tommies and succulent chops

41:21.729 --> 41:23.276
<i>Please enter your destination.</i>

41:23.277 --> 41:26.942
♫ I've chickens and conies
and pretty polonies

41:26.943 --> 41:28.411
Miss Tainot!

41:29.070 --> 41:33.120
- Miss Tainot!
- ♫ Excellent peppermint drops

41:33.241 --> 41:35.242
I can't believe this.

41:35.243 --> 41:37.416
♫ Then buy of your Buttercup

41:37.495 --> 41:39.964
♫ This man is looking at me

41:49.674 --> 41:51.347
It's Larry Crowne!

41:52.677 --> 41:54.094
Right, hi!

41:54.095 --> 41:56.763
I have you for Speech 217
in just a couple of minutes.

41:56.764 --> 41:58.473
Yes, you do.

41:58.474 --> 42:01.478
- I saw you singing.
- Oh, I'm just drowning out the GPS.

42:01.644 --> 42:03.772
See? It never stops.

42:03.855 --> 42:05.357
Well, no wonder, that's a Map Genie.

42:05.481 --> 42:06.824
Back when I sold you such things,

42:06.899 --> 42:10.199
I would've steered you toward a Vortex,
'cause the Map Genie has...

42:10.278 --> 42:12.030
It's very complicated.

42:12.113 --> 42:14.491
Well, no wonder,
the auto-on feature is engaged.

42:14.574 --> 42:18.670
So, menu, select, features,

42:18.745 --> 42:21.294
auto, voice select.

42:21.372 --> 42:24.626
Change? Yes. On/off.

42:24.709 --> 42:27.087
Off. Change? Yes.

42:27.170 --> 42:30.174
Save, and back, back, back, back, and exit.

42:31.132 --> 42:33.226
Oh.

42:33.301 --> 42:36.726
- How long was that broken?
- Ever since my husband installed it himself.

42:36.804 --> 42:39.398
- Well, it's all fixed now.
- Thank you.

42:39.474 --> 42:41.850
What are you gonna make us do
today in class, hmm?

42:41.851 --> 42:43.273
You'll just have to find out.

42:43.394 --> 42:44.737
Follow me.

42:46.773 --> 42:48.116
Interesting.

42:50.485 --> 42:54.615
Looking down at your notes,
your hands, is a downer.

42:54.822 --> 42:56.495
Look up at your audience.

42:56.991 --> 43:01.918
Find not one but three different focal
points and move your attention to each one.

43:01.996 --> 43:05.216
Start on the one side,
looking into the eyes of whoever's there.

43:05.708 --> 43:07.335
- Hello.
- Hi.

43:11.672 --> 43:14.767
The center is where major points are made.

43:16.177 --> 43:18.179
Make them there.

43:22.350 --> 43:26.901
Once you've come to the other side, you know
you've included everyone in the conversation.

43:32.693 --> 43:35.947
You don't wanna spend too much
time on any one focal point.

43:36.280 --> 43:40.330
If you're looking and speaking
to only one of your audience,

43:40.785 --> 43:43.538
that person may get the wrong

43:44.372 --> 43:45.794
message.

43:50.711 --> 43:52.304
Who wants to be first?

43:52.421 --> 43:57.302
If the balance on axis A
is the same metric as axis B,

43:57.802 --> 44:02.228
deficits appear because of overhead,
taxes and reinvestment.

44:03.182 --> 44:04.729
Translation?

44:05.518 --> 44:07.361
Miss Francesco.

44:08.187 --> 44:10.064
Something very complicated.

44:10.565 --> 44:11.908
Mr Crowne.

44:14.861 --> 44:18.741
The break-even paradox
of the static-flow assumption?

44:19.699 --> 44:23.749
That is the correct answer, from page 56.

44:24.245 --> 44:26.589
Someone's been reading the course pack.

44:27.290 --> 44:31.011
While economic law abhors an assumption,

44:31.711 --> 44:35.136
the break-even paradox creates
a whole new metric,

44:35.590 --> 44:38.764
an illusory flow that appears proactive

44:39.218 --> 44:41.767
but is, in fact, static.

44:58.279 --> 45:01.158
Holy smoke! You've got inventory.

45:01.240 --> 45:02.616
Yes, I do.

45:02.617 --> 45:04.369
Bad feng shui, though.

45:05.453 --> 45:10.084
This is all unproductive capital sitting
here, unless you're selling it on eBay.

45:10.666 --> 45:12.509
Never buy clothes you don't try on.

45:12.585 --> 45:15.259
You have to feel the
fabric and test the drape.

45:15.546 --> 45:17.969
- I don't.
- Take off your pants.

45:18.758 --> 45:20.175
What?

45:20.176 --> 45:21.644
Take off your pants.

45:22.220 --> 45:23.642
Really?

45:23.721 --> 45:26.520
Get behind that rack and
take off your pants!

45:27.934 --> 45:30.778
You know, I can't really afford
all these new threads.

45:30.853 --> 45:32.480
'Tis gratis, Lance.

45:35.524 --> 45:38.528
Lance, my boyfriend's here.
Put your pants back on.

45:39.362 --> 45:40.739
Yeah, Lance.

45:41.989 --> 45:43.411
Put your pants back on.

45:45.826 --> 45:47.169
Oh...

45:53.209 --> 45:54.677
These are a little tight.

45:57.004 --> 45:58.347
Hold on.

46:08.015 --> 46:09.392
Two more, please.

46:11.602 --> 46:13.525
I knew there was a reason
I skipped college.

46:13.604 --> 46:16.022
If I hadn't taken Matsutani's class,

46:16.023 --> 46:19.869
I'd never know how bad things really are.
My gross assets, my true debit flow,

46:20.027 --> 46:21.700
my value index.

46:22.154 --> 46:26.375
Well, if you need a job that'll hold
you over there, Kemo Sabe, just ask.

46:27.743 --> 46:29.916
You can still work a line, can't you?

46:29.996 --> 46:31.339
Yeah, I think so.

46:31.664 --> 46:33.915
All right, just work it out with Raul.

46:33.916 --> 46:36.886
He's tough, but fair.

46:37.044 --> 46:39.467
I'm the boss of this kitchen. You know why?

46:39.547 --> 46:42.257
- Because I'm tough, but I'm fair.
- Tough but fair.

46:42.258 --> 46:43.885
You say you wanna work for me? Okay.

46:43.886 --> 46:45.386
If you can use me.

46:45.469 --> 46:47.221
Can I use you?

46:47.222 --> 46:48.939
Hey, Nick, how many jobs you got?

46:49.015 --> 46:50.813
Three, and I coach Little League.

46:52.935 --> 46:56.439
<i>En América, tres, en México, tres,
en Panamá, uno.</i>

46:58.607 --> 47:00.655
How long has it been
since you manned a kitchen, anyway?

47:00.776 --> 47:02.778
It's been a few years.

47:06.615 --> 47:09.494
Bang this bad boy out, then we'll see.

47:19.003 --> 47:20.471
Order up!

47:21.797 --> 47:23.799
- Here they are.
- Okay.

47:24.425 --> 47:26.302
You're gonna be on-call.
You don't like it, walk.

47:26.385 --> 47:27.805
I need to stay in school.

47:27.806 --> 47:29.305
You can stay in a convent for all I care.

47:29.306 --> 47:32.275
- Just be on time and don't steal the flatware.
- Deal.

47:32.391 --> 47:34.314
- I'm a good boss, right?
- Great boss!

47:34.393 --> 47:36.395
Tough, but fair.

47:36.479 --> 47:38.277
Thank you.

47:38.439 --> 47:41.107
This may be beyond comprehension,

47:41.108 --> 47:43.987
<i>but there are many people
who dismiss Deep Space Nine</i>

47:44.070 --> 47:46.698
<i>in favour of the original
or The Next Generation.</i>

47:46.781 --> 47:50.116
Although I, too, am a fan
of both of Roddenberry's visions,

47:50.117 --> 47:52.711
<i>there is no version of Star
Trek I do not enjoy.</i>

47:52.787 --> 47:54.130
None.

47:54.789 --> 47:56.831
As you can tell by my uniform,

47:56.832 --> 47:59.176
had I the chance to
attend Starfleet Academy,

47:59.251 --> 48:00.628
I would have studied the Life Sciences.

48:00.629 --> 48:03.131
Who's cutting my class?
Where is Larry Crowne?

48:06.967 --> 48:08.765
Maybe he got the flu.

48:09.970 --> 48:13.395
Mr Mack, I apologise.

48:13.474 --> 48:15.818
<i>Please continue on with Star Wars.</i>

48:15.893 --> 48:18.021
In the deep space.

48:19.730 --> 48:22.649
<i>I can't even begin to tell you the
difference between Star Trek</i>

48:22.650 --> 48:24.994
<i>and Lucas' Star Wars saga. It's...</i>

48:28.531 --> 48:29.999
Live long and prosper.

48:30.866 --> 48:32.243
Energise.

48:43.045 --> 48:47.767
Bankruptcy. An economy
cannot be free without bankruptcy.

48:48.551 --> 48:52.397
Its penalties are obvious,
but what are its rewards?

48:52.596 --> 48:55.145
I am so sorry I'm late.

48:55.808 --> 48:59.352
Dr Matsutani, can I still sit in?

48:59.353 --> 49:01.196
This is college, Mr Crowne.

49:01.272 --> 49:03.570
There are only two things you can't do,

49:03.649 --> 49:05.401
smoke in the building

49:05.526 --> 49:08.700
and use your phone in my class.

49:09.572 --> 49:11.165
Thank you.

49:12.283 --> 49:15.702
The advantage of a bankruptcy works
both ways? How?

49:15.703 --> 49:20.209
You're here? You have some nerve showing
your face after you've skipped my class.

49:20.458 --> 49:22.460
Miss Tainot. A pleasure to see you.

49:22.543 --> 49:25.342
Dr M. Oh, did he skip your class, also?

49:25.504 --> 49:26.881
In fact, he was tardy.

49:29.425 --> 49:32.427
- Miss Tainot, this will never happen again.
- It will never happen again.

49:32.428 --> 49:35.056
And the next class, you will be first up
for Pop Topics.

49:35.222 --> 49:37.941
Two minutes, Pop Topics, first up.

49:54.909 --> 49:58.459
Interior design.

50:06.420 --> 50:08.548
Workplace etiquette.

50:09.423 --> 50:10.766
Good one.

50:20.601 --> 50:21.944
I hope they're worth it!

50:22.061 --> 50:25.065
- No, no, no, seriously, they're amazing!
- All right.

50:25.356 --> 50:26.733
Come on.

50:31.028 --> 50:32.871
I don't believe this.

50:34.490 --> 50:36.788
Sharing sweets with a little dolly.

50:36.951 --> 50:39.454
I bet that's why he went to college.

50:39.954 --> 50:42.958
Find a gal who has a thing for papa bear.

50:44.708 --> 50:46.836
And hideous pink doughnuts.

50:47.711 --> 50:49.713
Oh!

50:49.797 --> 50:51.390
Isn't that adorable?

50:55.678 --> 50:58.477
Ooh! Who's this?

50:59.598 --> 51:02.477
Wow, Larry! Nice job.

51:04.144 --> 51:07.648
Hey, there, Project Runway! I choose you.

51:08.524 --> 51:12.950
Hey, Johnny Cash. Where's your guitar?

51:15.656 --> 51:18.500
Mr Crowne is first. Pick and speak.

51:29.044 --> 51:30.842
Does this say "interior design"?

51:31.297 --> 51:32.674
Let's say yes.

51:37.761 --> 51:39.559
And go.

51:46.270 --> 51:47.943
Interior design.

51:50.566 --> 51:53.536
I know nothing
about interior design.

51:54.820 --> 52:00.533
But I don't have to, because
I know this girl who does.

52:00.534 --> 52:02.582
And the first time she came into my house

52:02.661 --> 52:05.371
she starts rearranging everything I own.

52:05.372 --> 52:11.220
She starts throwing out, you know, junk,
and rearranging my things

52:11.295 --> 52:14.922
and moving my furniture to places
that it's never, ever been before.

52:14.923 --> 52:20.020
And, before I know it,
I have a Spartan interior design

52:20.137 --> 52:23.016
with traffic flow and feng shui,

52:23.182 --> 52:25.401
in which everything has to be set just so,

52:25.476 --> 52:29.322
otherwise the chi or the spirit of
the house doesn't move.

52:29.396 --> 52:32.491
Then she moves from my living room
into my bedroom

52:32.566 --> 52:34.785
and that place is a horror show.

52:34.902 --> 52:37.111
My closet is a disaster.

52:37.112 --> 52:39.490
I have too many of the
wrong kind of hangers

52:39.573 --> 52:44.077
and I don't have enough scarves
to match my ensemble.

52:44.078 --> 52:47.298
And my dresser drawers are pitiful.
And she's throwing out...

52:47.373 --> 52:49.842
Oh, I can't wear matching pyjamas

52:50.000 --> 52:52.293
only pyjama bottoms and a T-shirt.

52:52.294 --> 52:55.218
Then she hops on my bed, and it's too hard!

52:55.339 --> 52:58.434
Who lives here? The Flintstones?
Ow, Bamm-Bamm, you hurt my neck.

53:00.719 --> 53:04.815
Then she threw out every one of my shirts.
Polo shirts are now forbidden.

53:05.265 --> 53:08.439
Can anyone
remember anything from that?

53:08.602 --> 53:11.776
Feng shui actually works.
I read about it in my Asian Studies class.

53:11.855 --> 53:13.277
Something about the Flintstones.

53:13.278 --> 53:15.608
Uh, Larry likes chicks
to rearrange his junk.

53:15.609 --> 53:18.112
That's what we women do.
We take you men and we make you better.

53:18.195 --> 53:20.948
We're moving off the topic.
Thank you, Mr Crowne.

53:21.031 --> 53:22.624
Chester, you're up.

54:16.503 --> 54:18.847
Finally, get rid of these.

54:19.965 --> 54:24.220
I get Dell to do the remodel and can restock
everything I move in the wink of an eye.

54:25.179 --> 54:27.273
Well, is...

54:27.347 --> 54:30.683
Nice, thank you.
Is this your plus-minus delta number?

54:30.684 --> 54:34.359
But that's what I'm asking you.
Square footage this cheap is a steal, right?

54:34.480 --> 54:38.610
Low overhead, cheap labour.
You will be in proht. Yeah, there.

54:42.196 --> 54:44.619
- I love you, Lance Corona!
- Well...

54:48.994 --> 54:50.371
Hey, Dell.

54:53.123 --> 54:55.091
I was just going back to work.

54:56.502 --> 55:00.803
I'm working my ass off all night just to
get one little f ricking smile out of you.

55:00.881 --> 55:04.977
- I'm smiling.
- Oh, yeah, like the Joker after three martinis.

55:05.052 --> 55:06.427
If they help, they help.

55:06.428 --> 55:08.647
You can't even have a date night now.

55:08.722 --> 55:10.565
You can't even chilloot for one minute!

55:10.566 --> 55:13.902
"Chilloot"? Did you just use
the word "chilloot"?

55:13.977 --> 55:17.151
Did that come
from a Canadian blogger thesaurus?

55:17.231 --> 55:19.404
Come on, let's just go home.
Get in the car.

55:24.571 --> 55:28.407
Could you please just hold on
to the cheesecake

55:28.408 --> 55:30.752
- so it doesn't slide back and forth?
- I'm allergic to cheesecake.

55:30.828 --> 55:32.671
- Is that too much to ask?
- Have you forgotten?

55:32.746 --> 55:34.747
Oh, my God. What, are you...

55:34.748 --> 55:38.173
Are you looking for a whole different
kind of man? Mercedes? Is that it?

55:38.252 --> 55:39.961
Sure.

55:39.962 --> 55:42.797
I got news for you, I like myself, okay?

55:42.798 --> 55:46.928
You know, I put up with you,
and I complain about nothing!

55:47.261 --> 55:50.185
I am not complaining. I am stating.

55:50.264 --> 55:53.859
I work and you porn-surf and pretend to work.
It's a statement.

55:53.934 --> 55:56.778
That's so much bull right there, okay?

55:56.895 --> 56:00.320
I had four postings today alone.

56:00.399 --> 56:04.318
Fogcaster, Skyscan, Parsec12.com.

56:04.319 --> 56:07.198
They're not postings, they're comments.

56:07.781 --> 56:11.117
Comments! Like, "You're lame" is a comment.

56:11.118 --> 56:14.372
And who are you to judge me, Boozilla?

56:16.582 --> 56:18.801
You know, I know what
really pisses you off.

56:18.917 --> 56:20.885
What is really pissing you off

56:20.961 --> 56:25.307
is that I like big knockers
and you don't have any!

56:30.137 --> 56:31.764
Maybe I should take that back.

56:33.015 --> 56:34.517
Stop this car.

56:35.601 --> 56:38.275
Stop this car.

56:39.021 --> 56:41.365
- I said I would take it back.
- Stop the car.

56:41.440 --> 56:43.659
Oh, come on, it was a joke!

56:44.109 --> 56:46.237
Let me out of this fucking car!

56:47.571 --> 56:49.414
- Give me that cheesecake.
- No, I take it back.

56:49.489 --> 56:50.832
- I take it back.
- How about you just drive?

56:50.908 --> 56:52.581
Look, I'm letting you win!

56:52.659 --> 56:54.994
Drive to a cliff on the coastline, mister!

56:54.995 --> 56:57.965
- So, everything that you say is right!
- You loser!

56:58.081 --> 57:02.837
I married a loser!
A childish, blogging loser!

57:03.003 --> 57:05.973
Okay, you know what?
Screw you, you washboard!

57:06.256 --> 57:08.600
Go! Oh, chilloot!

57:08.675 --> 57:10.427
I like big knockers!

57:29.863 --> 57:33.037
Hey, Lance! Chick alert!

57:34.034 --> 57:36.708
You are not gonna believe
how fate meets cute.

57:39.039 --> 57:40.541
Well, come on!

57:50.467 --> 57:53.846
Look who's
waiting for a bus! Miss Tainot?

57:54.513 --> 57:56.481
Do you need a ride? Hop on.

57:57.891 --> 58:00.644
Bust up your dance in the dell with Bambi?
No, thanks.

58:00.978 --> 58:03.276
Hey! Bambi was a boy.

58:05.065 --> 58:06.942
- Hey, can you spare your spare?
- Sure.

58:07.734 --> 58:09.202
Thank you.

58:12.072 --> 58:15.246
- Where did you go?
- Just hooking Lance up, sweetie.

58:15.409 --> 58:17.286
A man on a scooter can accomplish
anything, Lance.

58:21.832 --> 58:26.429
What do men see in irritating free spirits?

58:27.004 --> 58:29.848
Seriously, I am offering you a ride.

58:30.590 --> 58:33.764
Seriously, I can walk.

58:38.473 --> 58:40.100
In those shoes?

58:44.104 --> 58:45.902
You noticed my shoes?

58:48.775 --> 58:52.780
Fine, I'll ride, but I will not wear
that bucket on my head.

58:53.488 --> 58:55.115
It's the law.

59:01.788 --> 59:05.791
We're going so slow a cat could
knock us over, you know that, right?

59:05.792 --> 59:09.842
I've never given anyone a ride before!
I wanna make sure we both survive!

59:12.966 --> 59:14.309
Pardon me?

59:14.426 --> 59:16.394
I said "ha, ha, ha".

59:16.470 --> 59:18.347
Oh, look at this!

59:18.430 --> 59:19.807
Somebody is getting pinched.

59:19.890 --> 59:22.609
- Put your hands behind your back, sir.
- No, you gotta be kidding me!

59:22.768 --> 59:25.237
Ooh, this looks like a DUl.
This guy's in trouble.

59:25.312 --> 59:27.531
- No!
- You have the right to an attorney.

59:27.606 --> 59:30.234
- Shut up, shut up! I know my rights!
- You understand that?

59:31.026 --> 59:32.869
- I know my rights!
- All right.

59:33.320 --> 59:34.742
- Here we go now.
- Hey!

59:34.821 --> 59:37.415
- Careful with that man's cheesecake, Officer!
- Now, watch your head.

59:37.491 --> 59:39.366
He's very sensitive about his cheesecake!

59:39.367 --> 59:40.914
Did you
know what you just did?

59:40.994 --> 59:42.996
I bet you 10 bucks
that he barfs in the backseat.

59:43.580 --> 59:45.002
It was a bad night for that guy.

59:47.584 --> 59:49.507
Drive on, Macduff!

59:57.052 --> 59:58.719
There it is!

59:58.720 --> 01:00:00.472
On the left, got it.

01:00:01.014 --> 01:00:03.483
On the left!

01:00:13.693 --> 01:00:15.528
You're following me.

01:00:15.529 --> 01:00:18.874
I'm just... I'm seeing you safely
to your door, that's all.

01:00:18.990 --> 01:00:20.958
Okay. Um...

01:00:21.493 --> 01:00:25.037
Oh, my purse. Do you have my...

01:00:25.038 --> 01:00:27.257
Oh, it's in the car. The car.

01:00:31.211 --> 01:00:35.341
There's a key buried in that plant.

01:00:37.092 --> 01:00:38.514
Whoo!

01:00:38.885 --> 01:00:40.228
This it?

01:00:41.513 --> 01:00:42.890
That is it.

01:00:43.807 --> 01:00:46.401
There appears to be some choices.

01:00:48.186 --> 01:00:49.937
Uh...

01:00:49.938 --> 01:00:51.656
Let's see.

01:00:52.649 --> 01:00:54.617
Let me get this for you.

01:00:56.862 --> 01:00:58.409
Ooh!

01:00:59.906 --> 01:01:04.503
I have 30 seconds to disarm the alarm
or the cops will be here in half an hour.

01:01:08.081 --> 01:01:09.754
- They're slow.
- Slow cops.

01:01:11.918 --> 01:01:14.467
Oh. Better get to it. Look away, please.

01:01:19.342 --> 01:01:20.685
Two,

01:01:23.263 --> 01:01:24.606
two,

01:01:26.391 --> 01:01:27.813
two,

01:01:29.269 --> 01:01:30.646
two.

01:01:31.521 --> 01:01:33.105
Pound.

01:01:33.106 --> 01:01:34.528
Gotcha.

01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:36.743
All right!

01:01:37.277 --> 01:01:40.030
Mission accomplished, Mr Man in the Black.

01:01:42.782 --> 01:01:45.376
- Good night, Miss Tainot.
- Missus.

01:01:45.452 --> 01:01:48.877
I'm Mrs Tainot.

01:01:48.955 --> 01:01:50.878
Can't you see that?

01:01:50.957 --> 01:01:52.959
I assumed you preferred Miss.

01:01:53.043 --> 01:01:56.718
Well, when you presume, you make
a pretty pair of asses out of me and you.

01:01:56.796 --> 01:01:58.764
Something like that, or...

01:01:59.382 --> 01:02:01.931
Do you know what I noticed on the ride?

01:02:03.094 --> 01:02:05.938
That you smell very pleasant.

01:02:08.141 --> 01:02:10.314
Well, thank you.

01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:16.408
Would you...

01:02:16.483 --> 01:02:17.951
Would you like to kiss me?

01:02:19.319 --> 01:02:23.995
Just if you... if you wanted to kiss me,
it would really

01:02:24.074 --> 01:02:28.124
be your lucky night,
because I'm half in the bag

01:02:28.245 --> 01:02:31.044
and my husband won't be home for,
you know,

01:02:31.122 --> 01:02:34.001
three to five years.

01:02:54.729 --> 01:02:56.697
Mmm-hmm! Mmm!

01:03:15.208 --> 01:03:16.585
Wow!

01:03:16.668 --> 01:03:19.046
Whoa! Did you feel that?

01:03:19.212 --> 01:03:20.714
Oh, this is crazy.

01:03:20.797 --> 01:03:23.846
Let's do that again, and this time,
permission to cop a feel.

01:03:23.925 --> 01:03:25.598
Uh, wait, okay, okay. Miss Tainot...

01:03:25.599 --> 01:03:27.428
Mrs Tainot, Mrs Tainot...

01:03:27.429 --> 01:03:29.227
Oh, please, it was... Wow!

01:03:29.306 --> 01:03:34.904
Mrs Tainot, it is now time
for both of us to do the right thing.

01:03:37.355 --> 01:03:39.153
- In you go.
- What?

01:03:39.316 --> 01:03:41.112
Are you kidding?
But I thought I smelled good, too.

01:03:41.113 --> 01:03:43.407
- Closing the door.
- How could you... Really? Really?

01:03:45.822 --> 01:03:47.074
Lock the door.

01:04:10.764 --> 01:04:12.812
I can see you, you know.

01:04:17.395 --> 01:04:18.772
Good night, Mrs Tainot.

01:04:41.169 --> 01:04:45.219
- All right, buddy, get out.
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Just keep it.

01:04:45.298 --> 01:04:48.768
- Oh, wow, great, thanks.
- It'll put my kid through college.

01:04:49.469 --> 01:04:52.097
Oh, my God.

01:04:56.184 --> 01:04:58.528
Aw, come on! Jerk!

01:05:07.612 --> 01:05:09.614
Oh, God, I need coffee.

01:05:09.948 --> 01:05:12.747
<i>I'm your dirty girl, bad boy.</i>

01:05:13.201 --> 01:05:15.795
<i>I'm your dirty girl, bad boy.</i>

01:05:16.704 --> 01:05:18.997
<i>I'm your dirty girl, bad boy.</i>

01:05:18.998 --> 01:05:21.171
Jesus, hell, and tomorrow.

01:05:22.836 --> 01:05:24.964
Mercy!

01:05:28.550 --> 01:05:30.223
Oh, shit.

01:05:32.679 --> 01:05:35.728
Fortune cookies!
Chinese food tells you the future!

01:05:36.349 --> 01:05:39.017
Sushi is fresh out of the sea.
Tempura is fresh out of the oil.

01:05:39.018 --> 01:05:40.816
Accent on fr-fr-fresh!

01:05:40.979 --> 01:05:45.190
But it won't keep overnight
like Kung Pao chicken.

01:05:45.191 --> 01:05:47.614
Those flavours the next day
are deep and delicious.

01:05:47.735 --> 01:05:49.533
Samurais are amazing chefs!

01:05:49.612 --> 01:05:51.285
I weigh, like, 90 pounds.

01:05:51.448 --> 01:05:54.074
What's my 2:00 a. m. meal
after a couple of puffs?

01:05:54.075 --> 01:05:58.797
Chinese food in the Chinese carton
with Chinese chopsticks!

01:05:58.997 --> 01:06:01.716
- Yeah, yeah!
- What about the MSG?

01:06:01.791 --> 01:06:05.170
That's enough of the fake debate for today.
Thank you for your passion.

01:06:05.336 --> 01:06:06.929
That was so fun!

01:06:09.048 --> 01:06:10.425
Mr Crowne?

01:06:11.259 --> 01:06:12.977
A moment, please.

01:06:13.219 --> 01:06:15.267
- Sure.
- Uh-oh!

01:06:17.599 --> 01:06:19.693
Sounds like you're in trouble.

01:06:32.906 --> 01:06:37.958
Last night was a confluence
of too many things happening

01:06:38.036 --> 01:06:40.004
in too short of a time span.

01:06:40.705 --> 01:06:42.080
Yeah.

01:06:42.081 --> 01:06:47.963
I believe there was an inappropriate
exchange between teacher and student.

01:06:50.423 --> 01:06:55.429
I was worked up and under the influence
of the demon rum.

01:06:57.931 --> 01:07:01.276
Reminded me of a spotty incident

01:07:02.310 --> 01:07:05.109
I once had with a parking lot attendant,

01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:08.283
which was...

01:07:12.111 --> 01:07:16.161
At any rate, I hope the entire thing

01:07:16.241 --> 01:07:18.369
can be forgiven and forgotten.

01:07:19.452 --> 01:07:21.204
If gossip of this nature were to circulate,

01:07:22.830 --> 01:07:25.128
it would be not only embarrassing,

01:07:25.208 --> 01:07:29.008
but my status as a professor could
be tarnished.

01:07:31.089 --> 01:07:32.591
Well, I wouldn't want that.

01:07:32.882 --> 01:07:35.305
So, no bragging to your pals about

01:07:36.219 --> 01:07:39.268
almost scoring with the drunken professor.

01:07:46.646 --> 01:07:48.819
Well, I should scurry along.

01:07:49.607 --> 01:07:52.986
Hope I don't have the same conversation
with Dr Matsutani.

01:08:23.474 --> 01:08:26.518
The papers and records
for 8656 Derby Court.

01:08:26.519 --> 01:08:30.354
Since River Creek Bank can't see
to give me new terms,

01:08:30.356 --> 01:08:34.901
my mortgage has become a bad debt
that I now transfer back to you.

01:08:34.902 --> 01:08:38.122
Oh. No, no, no.
You don't wanna default on this.

01:08:38.197 --> 01:08:40.575
It's called a strategic foreclosure.

01:08:40.658 --> 01:08:43.081
Oh, I know what it's called,
but you can't do this.

01:08:43.161 --> 01:08:45.412
See, it's bad for your credit.

01:08:45.412 --> 01:08:49.259
Any student of Economics 1 will tell you
this move is tough, but fair.

01:08:50.251 --> 01:08:54.221
Larry, let's go have ourselves some
complimentary coffee

01:08:54.296 --> 01:08:55.640
and we'll talk this out.

01:08:55.715 --> 01:08:59.765
Legally, I have to vacate the premises
in 30 days. Keys are in it.

01:09:01.345 --> 01:09:05.067
This is not personal, Mrs Gammelgaard.
It's just, well, times have changed.

01:09:10.979 --> 01:09:12.323
Oh, shoot!

01:09:12.774 --> 01:09:15.067
When we bought this house,

01:09:15.068 --> 01:09:18.072
I thought I'd see my kids grow up
on this street.

01:09:18.154 --> 01:09:21.073
Man, you're whining
like a goo-goo, ga-ga baby,

01:09:21.073 --> 01:09:24.910
when you got your health,
you got no family to support.

01:09:24.911 --> 01:09:28.461
You're pale in America.
You're a clean slate.

01:09:28.956 --> 01:09:30.582
You're starting over.

01:09:31.584 --> 01:09:33.712
I just hate to leave.

01:09:34.170 --> 01:09:38.515
Well, manifest destiny is taking you
someplace else, neighbour.

01:09:40.926 --> 01:09:43.520
You took the time to meditate
on the vagaries of life,

01:09:43.595 --> 01:09:45.849
You'd come to realise

01:09:48.518 --> 01:09:51.812
that a woman with a measuring tape

01:09:51.813 --> 01:09:53.689
is money in my pocket.

01:09:54.273 --> 01:09:55.982
How you ladies doing?

01:09:55.983 --> 01:09:58.862
Oh, this is a nice one right here.
An old football table.

01:09:59.070 --> 01:10:00.617
David Beckham actually owned this one.

01:10:00.618 --> 01:10:03.492
Now, I got a offer for 1,800.
You just gotta beat that.

01:10:08.037 --> 01:10:11.498
<i>Showers should clear
before the morning commute.</i>

01:10:11.499 --> 01:10:14.673
<i>Look for sunny skies by 9:00 a. m.
with temperatures in the mid-70s.</i>

01:10:31.602 --> 01:10:33.812
These topics are to be researched

01:10:33.813 --> 01:10:37.909
until you can wax poetic on them
for two minutes.

01:10:37.984 --> 01:10:39.526
- What'd you get?
- Potatoes.

01:10:39.527 --> 01:10:41.361
Spuds. Can't wait.

01:10:41.362 --> 01:10:44.457
No repetition, no pauses.

01:10:46.409 --> 01:10:48.787
"Disraeli"? What is that?

01:10:49.328 --> 01:10:50.705
"Who" is that.

01:10:51.956 --> 01:10:54.209
Guy from Disrael. I'm done!

01:10:54.834 --> 01:10:58.384
No notes, no visual aids,
just sacks of charm.

01:10:59.172 --> 01:11:01.140
"Geography Show"?

01:11:01.257 --> 01:11:03.259
- That says "George Bernard Shaw".
- No, it doesn't.

01:11:03.342 --> 01:11:05.265
Well, the handwriting's kind of loopy.

01:11:05.678 --> 01:11:08.181
Then "Geography Show" for two minutes.

01:11:10.892 --> 01:11:12.519
- Pasta!
- Great.

01:11:12.602 --> 01:11:14.604
Good luck, everybody. This is your final.

01:11:14.771 --> 01:11:16.398
You're dismissed.

01:11:26.741 --> 01:11:28.209
Have a good day.

01:11:31.871 --> 01:11:33.293
Oh, thanks.

01:11:38.961 --> 01:11:40.759
Let me get this straight.

01:11:40.838 --> 01:11:44.758
You think dropping my class to open
a thrift store is a good idea.

01:11:44.759 --> 01:11:46.227
Not by much.

01:11:47.845 --> 01:11:50.064
Mercy? Mercy, come and meet this girl.

01:11:50.181 --> 01:11:53.481
She brings passion
to Feminism and Modern Lit.

01:11:53.559 --> 01:11:56.403
We should all be a witness.
And she's leaving me.

01:11:57.188 --> 01:11:58.531
We've met.

01:11:58.731 --> 01:12:00.449
That was some night, huh?

01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:03.869
I'm sure you and Larry Crowne have
your pillow talk.

01:12:03.945 --> 01:12:05.743
Pillow talk?

01:12:07.782 --> 01:12:11.628
Lance is a sweetie,
but I think he was born in the 1950s.

01:12:13.663 --> 01:12:17.338
Lance is forever mute on the subject of you.
Can't get a peep out of him.

01:12:24.257 --> 01:12:26.476
Lance? Larry Crowne? Who?

01:12:26.551 --> 01:12:29.430
- One and the same.
- He works at Frank's Coffee Shop.

01:12:29.595 --> 01:12:31.973
- The pie place?
- Great French toast.

01:12:33.015 --> 01:12:36.601
At the end of each chapter
is a study guide.

01:12:36.602 --> 01:12:40.105
Master those and you will have mastered
the course pack.

01:12:40.106 --> 01:12:41.608
Where's Talia?

01:12:42.358 --> 01:12:43.735
Where's Talia?

01:12:43.818 --> 01:12:48.039
Master my course pack
and you will take over the world.

01:12:54.704 --> 01:12:57.127
By now, you should be laughing with me.

01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:22.983
- Hey, there's Lance.
- Oh, yeah.

01:13:25.151 --> 01:13:26.744
What a surprise.

01:13:27.695 --> 01:13:30.289
Somebody skipped Matsutani's class!

01:13:30.489 --> 01:13:32.742
I dropped out of college today.

01:13:32.909 --> 01:13:34.252
What?

01:13:34.327 --> 01:13:37.080
No, Talia, don't be a fool, stay in school.

01:13:37.163 --> 01:13:40.588
And don't drink and drive, or do drugs,
and quit smoking, and eat vegetables.

01:13:41.042 --> 01:13:43.386
I don't, I stopped, I did, I do.

01:13:44.337 --> 01:13:45.884
New watch for you.

01:13:45.963 --> 01:13:47.636
Hey, we all got free tattoos.

01:13:47.715 --> 01:13:50.184
I wanted something in Japanese,
so check this out.

01:13:51.427 --> 01:13:54.146
That one says "courage".
That one says “spirit".

01:13:54.388 --> 01:13:56.436
Courageous spirit.

01:14:00.144 --> 01:14:01.519
I can see you!

01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:03.864
This is glass! I can see through glass!

01:14:06.317 --> 01:14:09.036
You know, that's Chinese, and it says

01:14:09.987 --> 01:14:12.697
- soy sauce.
- Oh, shut up!

01:14:12.698 --> 01:14:14.917
It does. Soy sauce!

01:14:15.868 --> 01:14:17.870
Be here for our grand opening.

01:14:17.954 --> 01:14:21.675
Oh, I might not make it.
Some of us have finals.

01:14:49.902 --> 01:14:51.370
Hi, Larry!

01:15:56.302 --> 01:15:57.975
- Mack.
- Yeah?

01:15:58.137 --> 01:15:59.889
- Got room for one more?
- I can try.

01:15:59.972 --> 01:16:01.440
Thanks.

01:16:01.807 --> 01:16:03.354
No room for your furniture?

01:16:03.476 --> 01:16:05.399
Well, it's a tiny place.

01:16:05.478 --> 01:16:07.979
How much you think you're gonna get
for this sofa sleeper?

01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:10.153
I don't know. You'll get me a good price.

01:16:11.150 --> 01:16:13.151
You're a smart man, Larry Crowne.

01:16:13.152 --> 01:16:14.825
Pizza's here at last!

01:16:15.571 --> 01:16:17.244
Here's that lunch I promised you.

01:16:23.579 --> 01:16:27.834
Did they tell you that I had one of
these discount coupons?

01:16:29.502 --> 01:16:31.846
Son of a cock.

01:16:31.921 --> 01:16:33.264
Larry Crowne.

01:16:34.548 --> 01:16:36.050
Jack Strang.

01:16:36.842 --> 01:16:41.348
Two extra large, a salad bucket
and a box of cinnamon frosted eggs. $16.50.

01:16:43.766 --> 01:16:47.521
Sorry to say this, but I need 2 bucks back.
Times are tough.

01:16:49.021 --> 01:16:50.364
Tell me about it.

01:16:51.690 --> 01:16:53.363
You know what, forget it.

01:16:53.442 --> 01:16:55.115
- Keep the change. Yeah.
- Really? Yeah?

01:16:55.194 --> 01:16:59.290
Hey, thanks, Crowne. I appreciate it.
Every buck helps.

01:16:59.365 --> 01:17:01.083
Put that right there.

01:17:01.084 --> 01:17:03.203
Lamar, don't touch the cinnamon eggs.

01:17:03.285 --> 01:17:05.083
I'm not gonna touch
the cinnamon eggs, baby.

01:17:05.084 --> 01:17:06.752
I don't want a cinnamon egg.

01:17:16.382 --> 01:17:18.601
- I'm gonna miss him. You, too.
- Yeah.

01:17:22.179 --> 01:17:24.430
- Oh, Larry.
- You're the best.

01:17:24.431 --> 01:17:25.890
Come back and see us.

01:17:25.891 --> 01:17:28.235
Larry, I got something for you.

01:17:29.895 --> 01:17:31.563
Good luck.

01:17:31.564 --> 01:17:34.067
- Well, I appreciate it, Lamar.
- If you win, I get half.

01:17:34.150 --> 01:17:36.109
Quick Picks. You never know.

01:17:36.110 --> 01:17:37.612
Bye, Larry!

01:17:41.323 --> 01:17:43.075
I'm gonna miss him.

01:17:45.828 --> 01:17:48.251
- See you, Larry!
- Goodbye, Larry!

01:18:34.835 --> 01:18:36.303
There is not a woman in the world

01:18:36.378 --> 01:18:39.598
that has not been standing
where you are right now.

01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:42.559
So, let's get it on. Come on!
Come on, let's go.

01:18:52.102 --> 01:18:54.730
There you go, there you go.
Yeah, baby, come on.

01:18:55.648 --> 01:18:57.241
Come on, come on.

01:19:01.695 --> 01:19:04.322
- How much change do you want back?
- Why don't you keep it?

01:19:04.323 --> 01:19:07.533
But just remember,
a teacher once gave you a $12 tip.

01:19:07.534 --> 01:19:09.707
- You stay in school.
- Thank you.

01:19:09.787 --> 01:19:12.336
You're a babe. Where do you teach?

01:19:12.581 --> 01:19:15.551
I'm divorcing a professor turned writer
turned blogger

01:19:15.668 --> 01:19:17.511
with the libido of a 13-year-old

01:19:17.586 --> 01:19:20.385
with two published books to his credit.

01:19:21.298 --> 01:19:23.596
When a man shows his true colours,

01:19:23.676 --> 01:19:27.397
that's when a woman has to make
the decision to go or no go.

01:19:29.014 --> 01:19:31.233
And we got pizza to go.

01:19:54.707 --> 01:19:56.675
Good morning, Larry.

01:19:57.543 --> 01:19:58.965
Good morning.

01:19:59.044 --> 01:20:01.638
Should I have been calling you Lance
all this time?

01:20:03.132 --> 01:20:05.385
Oh, no. Only one person calls me Lance.

01:20:05.467 --> 01:20:07.260
Well, and all her friends.

01:20:07.261 --> 01:20:10.105
I met her. She's an interesting girl.

01:20:10.639 --> 01:20:13.563
She's a unique bundle, yeah.

01:20:14.184 --> 01:20:16.937
And all this, you know,
my clothes are her idea.

01:20:17.021 --> 01:20:19.399
I had actually put that together.

01:20:19.898 --> 01:20:21.491
You ready for your final?

01:20:21.567 --> 01:20:23.109
Well, you'll find out.

01:20:23.110 --> 01:20:25.078
I drew
the order last night.

01:20:25.079 --> 01:20:26.738
- And?
- You're last.

01:20:26.739 --> 01:20:28.161
Lucky me.

01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:30.993
- Thank you, by the way.
- What did I do?

01:20:31.827 --> 01:20:34.080
- Kept our secret.
- Oh.

01:20:34.580 --> 01:20:36.958
I don't do many things well,
but I can keep a secret.

01:20:37.082 --> 01:20:38.755
Gentlemen do.

01:20:40.002 --> 01:20:41.629
Allow me.

01:20:43.839 --> 01:20:45.256
Morning!

01:20:45.257 --> 01:20:48.136
- Good morning!
- Let's make a few changes.

01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:51.637
A box of biscuits, a bag of biscuits,
a biscuit mixer! Say it!

01:20:51.638 --> 01:20:54.812
A box of biscuits, a
bag of biscuits, a biscuit mixer!

01:20:54.892 --> 01:20:56.269
Mr Mack, get loose.

01:20:56.352 --> 01:20:59.276
Red leather, yellow leather.
Red leather, yellow leather.

01:20:59.563 --> 01:21:02.191
Red leather, yellow leather.
Red leather, yellow leather.

01:21:02.316 --> 01:21:05.536
And we're moving, we're moving!
This is like Tainot-palooza! Breathing.

01:21:05.611 --> 01:21:08.455
Giving birth to relaxation.

01:21:10.157 --> 01:21:12.283
Pasta comes in all shapes and sizes.

01:21:12.284 --> 01:21:15.879
Farfalle, otherwise known as butterfly
or bow-tie shaped pasta...

01:21:16.121 --> 01:21:18.715
Because Australia's been an island
since the beginning of time,

01:21:18.791 --> 01:21:21.920
some awfully goofy animals can be
found there. Kangaroos, of course...

01:21:22.044 --> 01:21:23.842
If you're on the Moon
and look down at Earth

01:21:23.962 --> 01:21:26.340
you could actually see and recognise
the Great Lakes.

01:21:26.423 --> 01:21:29.472
They comprise 20% of the world's
fresh surface water supply.

01:21:29.551 --> 01:21:31.804
Aurora borealis can be found
in the northern hemisphere

01:21:31.887 --> 01:21:34.305
in Alaska, Canada, and Scandinavia.

01:21:34.306 --> 01:21:35.728
<i>- Everybody loves potatoes.
- How about that?</i>

01:21:35.891 --> 01:21:38.895
French fries, baked potato, potato chips,
scalloped potatoes...

01:21:38.977 --> 01:21:43.481
If it was the romance novelist in him
that made Victoria, the Queen, such a pal,

01:21:43.482 --> 01:21:47.485
chalk it up as another brick
in the legacy of Ben Disraeli,

01:21:47.486 --> 01:21:50.655
Earl of Beaconsield,

01:21:50.656 --> 01:21:52.657
educator,

01:21:52.658 --> 01:21:55.457
and Prime Minister of Great Britain!

01:21:57.663 --> 01:21:59.165
Yeah!

01:22:01.083 --> 01:22:02.801
Boom.

01:22:03.710 --> 01:22:05.336
Dibiasi, that was great.

01:22:08.173 --> 01:22:11.347
That leaves only Mr Crowne
and George Bernard Shaw.

01:22:11.468 --> 01:22:14.938
Uh, that's "Geography Show", remember?

01:22:15.264 --> 01:22:17.858
Right, the study of the Earth.

01:22:18.100 --> 01:22:21.570
Yes, study of the Earth, and there goes
my opening remark.

01:22:22.938 --> 01:22:25.566
Thank you.

01:22:25.649 --> 01:22:27.617
The equator

01:22:27.693 --> 01:22:31.948
is that imaginary line
that separates the Earth

01:22:32.030 --> 01:22:34.031
into the northern
and the southern hemisphere.

01:22:34.032 --> 01:22:37.002
And when you cross it for the first time

01:22:37.077 --> 01:22:39.796
it's a very big deal if
you are in the Navy,

01:22:39.872 --> 01:22:42.295
even if you're a culinary specialist.

01:22:42.708 --> 01:22:46.758
The old guys make you dress up
in goofy costumes

01:22:46.837 --> 01:22:48.880
and you have to sing these bawdy songs.

01:22:48.881 --> 01:22:51.430
And they play practical jokes on you.

01:22:51.508 --> 01:22:54.136
When I did it for the
first time, years ago,

01:22:54.219 --> 01:22:57.564
a chief petty officer ordered me
to stand watch

01:22:57.639 --> 01:23:00.108
until I saw the equator as we passed it,

01:23:00.184 --> 01:23:01.982
and I would recognize it by the big posts

01:23:02.060 --> 01:23:06.110
that were sunk into the ocean floor
and spaced every 100 yards.

01:23:06.190 --> 01:23:09.785
And, obviously, I never
hit my rack that night.

01:23:10.402 --> 01:23:13.155
Remember the old commercial for the Navy?

01:23:13.322 --> 01:23:15.406
"Join the Navy, see the world"?

01:23:15.407 --> 01:23:17.580
Well, it's true. I did.

01:23:17.659 --> 01:23:22.916
I saw landmarks that were both manmade
and the natural things.

01:23:22.998 --> 01:23:25.421
I saw deltas, I saw mountain ranges.

01:23:25.751 --> 01:23:28.794
I saw the Rock of Gibraltar.
I saw Hong Kong.

01:23:28.795 --> 01:23:31.589
And I saw the southern sky,

01:23:31.590 --> 01:23:34.469
which has different stars
than the northern sky does.

01:23:34.635 --> 01:23:37.184
In the Navy,
I went around the world five times.

01:23:38.138 --> 01:23:40.186
I saw the aurora borealis.

01:23:40.933 --> 01:23:43.857
I had shore leave in Australia,

01:23:44.311 --> 01:23:45.858
couple of times. Quite memorable.

01:23:45.938 --> 01:23:49.613
And I saw the Great Lakes from the rail
of a missile frigate

01:23:49.733 --> 01:23:51.110
while I was on the Great Lakes.

01:23:51.111 --> 01:23:56.331
I boiled and peeled and mashed and hashed
an awful lot of potatoes.

01:23:57.282 --> 01:23:59.956
I saw pasta once a week.

01:24:00.118 --> 01:24:03.622
Spaghetti Wednesdays, when I was in
charge of the galley.

01:24:03.705 --> 01:24:06.123
I learned a lot of geography in the Navy

01:24:06.124 --> 01:24:10.300
but I would never be able to
communicate it to you

01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:13.348
with such ease

01:24:13.423 --> 01:24:17.724
unless I had taken a class like this.

01:24:19.763 --> 01:24:24.769
I believe it was George Bernard Shaw
who once quipped,

01:24:24.977 --> 01:24:30.484
"A fool's brain digests
philosophy into folly,

01:24:31.358 --> 01:24:33.611
science into superstition

01:24:34.820 --> 01:24:36.868
and art into pedantry.

01:24:36.947 --> 01:24:40.668
Hence a university education. "

01:24:41.577 --> 01:24:46.174
Sounds to me like George Bernard Shaw
must have taken a college class

01:24:46.707 --> 01:24:52.134
maybe even Speech 217,
the Art of Informal Remarks.

01:24:56.133 --> 01:24:58.261
Ding-ding! Applause, please!

01:25:02.055 --> 01:25:03.523
Yeah!

01:25:06.018 --> 01:25:09.522
- Larry!
- Be aggressive, Larry!

01:25:11.690 --> 01:25:13.283
Larry
Crowne, you're terrific!

01:25:13.358 --> 01:25:15.326
Oh, that was incredible.

01:25:17.613 --> 01:25:19.331
Best speech ever!

01:25:45.098 --> 01:25:47.851
The first to finish. No surprise.

01:25:49.102 --> 01:25:50.479
Mr Crowne,

01:25:51.438 --> 01:25:54.988
you have a grasp of my concepts
like few others.

01:25:57.235 --> 01:25:58.908
Thank you, Doctor.

01:26:37.025 --> 01:26:38.447
Hmm.

01:26:39.569 --> 01:26:42.618
Cottage cheese to keep
me trim, fruit to keep me regular,

01:26:42.698 --> 01:26:44.792
and a big-ass biscuit.

01:26:46.118 --> 01:26:48.837
Club sandwich, white toast,
order of French fry, chicken-fried steak.

01:26:48.912 --> 01:26:51.381
That's right, chicken-fried.
Big-time, Larry.

01:26:59.256 --> 01:27:00.974
Spectacular.

01:27:01.299 --> 01:27:02.721
Hey, Nick.

01:27:02.801 --> 01:27:04.849
- Take the wheel for a second.
- All right.

01:27:04.970 --> 01:27:06.813
Is this the place with the killer pie?

01:27:07.013 --> 01:27:09.482
What's Spanish for
"My next wife just walked in"?

01:27:16.481 --> 01:27:20.987
Hello, I'm Larry, and I will be
your culinary specialist today.

01:27:21.903 --> 01:27:25.077
Larry Crowne, look at you. You work here?

01:27:25.157 --> 01:27:26.830
- It's my secret identity.
- Right.

01:27:27.242 --> 01:27:31.203
Frances, this is the A student
I was telling you about.

01:27:31.204 --> 01:27:33.047
The one that smells so nice.

01:27:33.498 --> 01:27:35.125
Larry, um,

01:27:35.792 --> 01:27:40.514
I actually gave you an
A-plus in Speech 217.

01:27:40.672 --> 01:27:43.340
"A" for excellent. Lance!

01:27:43.341 --> 01:27:45.059
A-plus?

01:27:45.677 --> 01:27:48.012
Well, I don't know what
to say, Miss Tainot.

01:27:48.013 --> 01:27:51.056
Please call me Mercy.
I'm not your teacher any more.

01:27:51.057 --> 01:27:52.684
Boo-hoo.

01:27:52.768 --> 01:27:54.611
Unless you signed up for next term.

01:27:56.354 --> 01:27:59.028
- Larry, kitchen, cook, busy.
- All right. My boss.

01:27:59.775 --> 01:28:01.277
Larry?

01:28:02.235 --> 01:28:05.364
You're a great student. I'm not an easy A.

01:28:07.866 --> 01:28:09.789
You're a great teacher.

01:28:13.789 --> 01:28:16.759
I got a whiff of the chef.
He smelled like grilled onions.

01:28:33.892 --> 01:28:35.565
Hey, thanks, Nick.

01:28:36.269 --> 01:28:39.739
Okay, I got this.
Greek salad, spaghetti, meatballs.

01:28:55.539 --> 01:28:59.339
The ships of finance
sail upon roiling seas,

01:28:59.459 --> 01:29:02.429
with hidden shoals of junk debt,

01:29:02.504 --> 01:29:05.923
squalls of undercapitalisation

01:29:05.924 --> 01:29:09.849
and tsunamis of the false value index.

01:29:10.929 --> 01:29:15.435
This course pack, written by guess who,

01:29:16.309 --> 01:29:20.109
is your map to a safe economic harbour.

01:29:21.106 --> 01:29:22.653
All aboard!

01:29:32.492 --> 01:29:36.954
The state charter requires a minimum of
10 students per class

01:29:36.955 --> 01:29:41.458
and since there are only eight of you,

01:29:41.459 --> 01:29:42.836
it costs them more...

01:29:44.588 --> 01:29:46.966
- Sorry we're late!
- Doesn't mean we don't care.

01:29:50.802 --> 01:29:52.179
Where's Larry?

01:29:52.262 --> 01:29:54.685
- Yeah, where is Larry?
- Crowne stiffed us?

01:29:54.806 --> 01:29:57.182
I thought for sure he'd be here.

01:29:57.183 --> 01:29:59.811
He told me your class changed his life.

01:30:02.230 --> 01:30:04.232
What's the name of this class, anyway?

01:30:04.983 --> 01:30:06.530
Shakespeare, the Politician.

01:30:07.944 --> 01:30:09.287
Seriously?

01:30:12.657 --> 01:30:15.376
Good morning, everyone.
My name is Miss Tainot.

01:30:15.452 --> 01:30:17.875
T-A-I-N-O-T.

01:30:17.954 --> 01:30:21.629
- Not Tae-Bo, not Tai Chi.
- Thanks a lot, guys.

01:30:22.375 --> 01:30:25.720
Not Tie-knot. Not Snotface.

01:30:59.788 --> 01:31:02.211
<i>Right
turn Harbor Street.</i>

01:31:02.457 --> 01:31:04.551
<i>- Thank you.
- Right turn.</i>

01:31:04.626 --> 01:31:06.210
Turning right.

01:31:06.211 --> 01:31:08.712
<i>Your destination is on the right.</i>

01:31:08.713 --> 01:31:11.136
Oh. Okay.

01:31:11.216 --> 01:31:13.389
Well, thank you, Map Genie.

01:31:37.659 --> 01:31:40.128
I love that dress, Cha-Cha!

01:31:40.203 --> 01:31:41.580
But I'd show more leg if I were you.

01:31:44.249 --> 01:31:46.092
4225?

01:31:47.168 --> 01:31:49.387
You're looking for Lance.

01:31:51.006 --> 01:31:52.599
4225.

01:31:52.674 --> 01:31:54.051
You'll see the stairs.

01:31:54.384 --> 01:31:55.727
Thank you.

01:31:58.972 --> 01:32:00.770
Shorter dress'll get you wolf whistles!

01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:06.275
Ow! For you. For you.

01:32:07.605 --> 01:32:10.358
- So, did he close that deal?
- Almost.

01:32:10.442 --> 01:32:12.194
Lance, Lance, Lance.

01:32:30.712 --> 01:32:32.089
Hello.

01:32:34.799 --> 01:32:36.221
Mercy.

01:32:40.096 --> 01:32:41.894
That's a good trick.

01:32:52.650 --> 01:32:55.153
You told Lala my class changed your life.

01:32:56.863 --> 01:32:59.161
Yes, yes, I said that.

01:33:03.745 --> 01:33:05.588
I met you.

01:33:41.366 --> 01:33:43.368
So, are you hungry?

01:33:45.078 --> 01:33:46.500
Extremely.

01:33:48.832 --> 01:33:51.381
Let me show you the
world's smallest kitchen.

01:33:53.878 --> 01:33:56.222
It's where I make my French toast.

01:33:57.305 --> 01:34:03.213
