death, death, death.

10:08.956 --> 10:10.827
Happy?

10:10.914 --> 10:13.047
Mom, you'’re kind of jumping
the gun.

10:13.134 --> 10:15.223
We won'’t get the results
of the biopsy for six more days.

10:15.310 --> 10:16.180
Don'’t you think you should...

10:16.267 --> 10:18.705
Death!

10:18.792 --> 10:20.358
Okay.

10:20.445 --> 10:22.012
Nighty-night.

10:22.099 --> 10:24.580
[sweetly]
Sweet dreams!

10:29.585 --> 10:30.847
Oh.

10:30.934 --> 10:32.283
Nice.

10:32.370 --> 10:35.678
No one cleans
like a crazy person.

10:35.765 --> 10:37.288
Hello? Mom?

10:37.375 --> 10:40.161
Upstairs!

10:41.771 --> 10:43.773
Hope she organized the closet.

10:48.386 --> 10:50.867
You okay?

10:50.954 --> 10:52.913
[sighs]
Just tired.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.611
I guess that'’s to be expected,
given my condition.

10:58.832 --> 11:02.531
Or you'’re tired
because you stayed up all night.

11:02.618 --> 11:03.880
[quietly]:
Damn.

11:03.967 --> 11:05.882
Christy,

11:05.969 --> 11:07.754
come. Sit.

11:07.841 --> 11:09.407
[sighs]

11:09.494 --> 11:11.192
Why do I come home?

11:13.585 --> 11:15.718
I love you.What?

11:15.805 --> 11:17.589
I said I love you.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.591
We don'’t say it enough.

11:19.679 --> 11:21.419
We don'’t say it ever.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.379
One of us doesn'’t even think it.

11:24.466 --> 11:26.511
Come on. Get out of bed.

11:26.598 --> 11:28.731
Let'’s go grab a bite to eat, and
then we'’ll go to the meeting.

11:28.818 --> 11:29.950
No, no. You go.

11:30.037 --> 11:33.257
Tell everyone to pray for me.

11:33.344 --> 11:36.391
Okay. But don'’t expect much.

11:36.478 --> 11:38.785
You know, I put

11:38.872 --> 11:41.962
my life at risk
for so many years.

11:42.049 --> 11:44.007
Drugs, alcohol,

11:44.094 --> 11:46.923
climbing into zoo enclosures
and taunting the animals.

11:47.010 --> 11:50.274
I-I never gave it
a second thought.

11:50.361 --> 11:53.974
And now every moment
feels so precious.

11:54.061 --> 11:56.150
And yet here you are
wasting my time.

11:56.237 --> 11:57.586
That'’s good.

11:57.673 --> 11:59.240
Laugh at me. Laugh at life.

11:59.327 --> 12:01.242
The whole thing'’s a joke.

12:01.329 --> 12:03.113
All righty. I'’m gonna skedaddle.

12:03.200 --> 12:05.246
Christy.Yeah. Quickly.

12:05.333 --> 12:08.423
Smell every rose.

12:10.033 --> 12:12.949
Sing every song.

12:13.036 --> 12:15.778
Dance like no one'’s watching.

12:15.865 --> 12:17.345
Will do.

12:17.432 --> 12:18.694
Oh, and if you
wouldn'’t mind,

12:18.781 --> 12:19.739
bring me home
a bucket of chicken.

12:20.914 --> 12:22.176
Extra crispy.

12:22.263 --> 12:23.351
[clicks tongue]

12:27.877 --> 12:30.575
Hi, I'’m Christy,
and I'’m an alcoholic.

12:30.662 --> 12:32.273
GROUP:
Hi, Christy.

12:32.360 --> 12:35.755
Well, this week has been
a doozy.

12:35.842 --> 12:39.062
My mom'’s in the middle
of a little health scare,

12:39.149 --> 12:41.891
and I am trying
to be compassionate.

12:41.978 --> 12:45.460
But you know her, she just sucks
it right out of you.

12:47.375 --> 12:49.203
On the plus side,

12:49.290 --> 12:53.250
our house hasn'’t been this clean
since she was doing blow.

12:55.209 --> 12:59.779
Anyway, she asked
for you to pray for her.

12:59.866 --> 13:01.781
Do with that what you will.

13:03.217 --> 13:05.306
Okay, who else
would like to share?

13:05.393 --> 13:06.786
I'’ll go.

13:06.873 --> 13:08.831
Hi, I'’m Jill.
I'’m an alcoholic.

13:08.918 --> 13:10.180
GROUP:
Hi, Jill.

13:10.267 --> 13:11.616
[sighs]
I'’ve been dealing

13:11.703 --> 13:13.793
with a little health issue
myself.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.969
My pool guy hurt his back,

13:16.056 --> 13:18.058
so the pool looks
like a Louisiana swamp.

13:18.145 --> 13:19.886
[door opens]

13:21.061 --> 13:22.932
Sorry.

13:35.989 --> 13:39.775
Anyway...

13:39.862 --> 13:41.690
if I'’m a little snippy,

13:41.777 --> 13:43.866
it'’s because I haven'’t
been getting my laps in

13:43.953 --> 13:47.043
and ballooned up to a size zero.

13:47.130 --> 13:49.872
[sighs]
That'’s it. Thanks.

13:49.959 --> 13:51.743
Anybody else?

13:51.831 --> 13:54.572
Hi, I'’m Bonnie.
I'’m an alcoholic.

13:54.659 --> 13:56.357
GROUP:
Hi, Bonnie.

13:56.444 --> 13:58.446
I wasn'’t gonna come tonight
because I was too busy

13:58.533 --> 14:00.230
feeling sorry for myself.

14:00.317 --> 14:03.016
But then I thought, "No, Bonnie.

14:03.103 --> 14:05.148
"You'’re not
a self-centered person.

14:05.235 --> 14:06.106
Don'’t start now."

14:09.979 --> 14:12.199
Sorry.

14:12.286 --> 14:14.114
Anyway,

14:14.201 --> 14:17.769
I want you to know
that I love, appreciate,

14:17.857 --> 14:21.425
and am grateful
for each and every one of you.

14:21.512 --> 14:24.254
You taught me how to live,

14:24.341 --> 14:26.996
and now...

14:27.083 --> 14:30.043
now I'’m gonna teach you
how to die.

14:32.349 --> 14:34.743
Oh, for God'’s sake,
shut up.

14:34.830 --> 14:35.787
Excuse me?

14:35.875 --> 14:37.224
Stop with all the drama.

14:37.311 --> 14:39.269
You don'’t even have
a diagnosis yet.

14:39.356 --> 14:41.924
And if you do,
it'’s not a death sentence.

14:42.011 --> 14:44.709
Hey, you shared
about your cancer all the time.

14:44.796 --> 14:48.061
Because I hadcancer!

14:48.148 --> 14:50.846
All you have is a chance
of cancer.

14:50.933 --> 14:52.282
You have...

14:52.369 --> 14:53.980
chancer!

14:54.067 --> 14:56.112
Okay.

14:56.199 --> 15:00.856
Apparently, this is not
the safe place I thought it was.

15:03.598 --> 15:05.426
[door slams]

15:05.513 --> 15:09.865
And as long as I'’m being honest,
screw you and your size zero.

15:13.956 --> 15:15.871
[knocking]

15:19.744 --> 15:21.659
Hey.Come on in.

15:21.746 --> 15:23.400
How'’s our patient?

15:23.487 --> 15:24.445
Who cares?

15:24.532 --> 15:26.490
Thank you. These are beautiful.

15:26.577 --> 15:28.318
Um, those are
kind of for your mom.

15:28.405 --> 15:31.365
Yeah, well, now they'’re mine.
She'’s upstairs.

15:31.452 --> 15:33.454
And if you see any more moles,
keep it to yourself.

15:35.282 --> 15:37.849
[knocking]

15:37.937 --> 15:39.025
Hello?

15:39.112 --> 15:40.504
Oh, hi. Come on in.

15:40.591 --> 15:43.855
For the record,
I brought you some flowers.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.161
Oh.

15:45.248 --> 15:47.033
Nice. Where are they?

15:47.120 --> 15:50.210
Christy took '’em for herself.
She was really mean.

15:50.297 --> 15:52.952
Try asking her
for a bucket of chicken.

15:53.039 --> 15:54.605
What are you doin'’ there?

15:54.692 --> 15:56.520
I'’m drawing up a list
of things I haven'’t done

15:56.607 --> 15:59.436
in case the biopsy
is bad news.

15:59.523 --> 16:03.136
Okay.You'’re not gonna tell me
I'’m being ridiculous?

16:03.223 --> 16:04.528
Nope. I think ridiculous

16:04.615 --> 16:06.487
is one of your more
endearing qualities.

16:06.574 --> 16:08.402
Let'’s see.

16:08.489 --> 16:10.752
"Throw out the first pitch
at a Giants game."

16:10.839 --> 16:14.321
While sober
and fully clothed.

16:14.408 --> 16:15.409
Okay.

16:15.496 --> 16:16.714
"Have dinner
at the White House."

16:16.801 --> 16:19.891
Again, sober
and fully clothed.

16:19.979 --> 16:22.503
"Jump out of a plane."
Sober and clothed?

16:22.590 --> 16:25.723
And without someone
pushing me.

16:25.810 --> 16:27.421
I'’m seein'’
a little trend here.

16:27.508 --> 16:30.859
Is there anything
you haven'’t done drunk or sober?

16:30.946 --> 16:32.992
Hmm...

16:33.079 --> 16:35.516
Christy, guess what.

16:35.603 --> 16:37.344
We'’re getting married!

16:38.519 --> 16:41.696
Of course you are.

16:41.783 --> 16:44.003
Those were your flowers.

16:50.313 --> 16:52.185
You know what'’s amazing?

16:52.272 --> 16:54.230
Even though I'’ve been scared
and hopeless all week,

16:54.317 --> 16:56.450
I-I haven'’t thought
about drinking.

16:56.537 --> 16:59.409
That is amazing. I ran out
of soy milk this morning

16:59.496 --> 17:02.064
and for a brief second
considered shooting heroin.

17:04.501 --> 17:05.936
Christy, I-I know

17:06.025 --> 17:06.938
I'’ve been a nightmare
through all this,

17:07.026 --> 17:07.983
and I'’m sorry.

17:08.069 --> 17:09.506
Yeah, thanks.

17:09.593 --> 17:12.074
Third movie, Batman,
seven letters.

17:12.161 --> 17:13.815
[knocking]

17:15.251 --> 17:18.819
So, we got the results
from your biopsy...

17:18.906 --> 17:20.082
Just say it.
I have cancer.

17:20.169 --> 17:23.128
Look at you, making my job easy.

17:23.215 --> 17:25.087
Oh, my God, what?

17:25.174 --> 17:26.609
The mole was indeed malignant,

17:26.696 --> 17:28.176
but we'’re confident
we got it all.

17:28.263 --> 17:29.352
There'’s no need
for further treatments,

17:29.439 --> 17:31.050
just regular checkups.

17:31.137 --> 17:34.357
So what you'’re saying is,
not only did I have cancer,

17:34.444 --> 17:36.359
I beat cancer?

17:36.446 --> 17:39.928
You beat it '’cause I carved
it out of your body, but okay.

17:40.015 --> 17:41.799
I'’ll see you again
in six months.

17:41.886 --> 17:44.063
Please don'’t steal
any more cotton balls.

17:46.282 --> 17:49.894
Oh, Mom. I was so worried
I was gonna lose you.

17:49.981 --> 17:53.159
Really? How come you
were being so horrible to me?

17:53.246 --> 17:55.639
'’Cause that'’s how I love!

17:56.988 --> 18:00.209
I guess
we have a wedding to plan.

18:00.296 --> 18:02.211
Uh...

18:02.298 --> 18:03.865
Mm.

18:03.952 --> 18:07.042
Yeah, Steve, uh, listen,

18:07.129 --> 18:09.697
about our engagement...

18:09.784 --> 18:11.351
You'’re pushing me out
of the plane?

18:11.438 --> 18:14.441
I-I'’m gonna live.
Why would I want to be married?
