♪ Help, help, help, help ♪

01:28.734 --> 01:30.984
- I know I'm not your pops.

01:32.770 --> 01:35.253
And when yours died, I get it.

01:37.330 --> 01:40.010
But I know your mama's
doing everything she can

01:40.010 --> 01:45.010
to keep you out of trouble,
so when she come to me,

01:45.320 --> 01:48.810
saying you talking back, coming in late,

01:48.810 --> 01:52.133
smelling like weed, 'sup, man?

01:54.240 --> 01:57.420
- Nah, everything cool, unc, I'm good.

01:57.420 --> 01:58.453
I can handle myself.

02:00.001 --> 02:01.401
- You're good, huh?
- Yeah.

02:03.860 --> 02:05.260
- Let me tell you like this.

02:07.441 --> 02:09.190
You ain't gonna be disrespecting your mama

02:11.557 --> 02:13.207
and them boys you hanging with...

02:15.702 --> 02:18.470
(sighs) You should come around
the house more, all right?

02:19.370 --> 02:22.863
Kick with Junior, he look at
you like a big brother anyways.

02:24.980 --> 02:26.200
Just want you to shine, nephew.

02:26.200 --> 02:27.560
- She been riding me
about shit for no reason.

02:27.560 --> 02:28.510
- Watch your mouth.

02:29.460 --> 02:30.353
I know your mama.

02:33.921 --> 02:36.220
And I know she wants the best for you.

02:36.220 --> 02:38.803
(phone buzzes)

02:40.342 --> 02:42.670
- I gotta take this.

02:42.670 --> 02:43.503
Hello?

02:45.830 --> 02:46.960
Are we done?

02:46.960 --> 02:48.910
- No, we ain't done, get off the phone.

02:50.380 --> 02:53.513
- I gotta call you back.
- Hang up the phone now.

02:57.778 --> 03:02.528
Hey, man, don't get it twisted,
I been through this shit.

03:03.462 --> 03:04.295
You hear me?

03:05.600 --> 03:10.600
You see Uncle Nate with the
business, with the lil garage,

03:11.430 --> 03:15.393
the family man, but I been
through the fire, Trey.

03:17.400 --> 03:19.700
That's why your mama
wanted me to talk to you.

03:21.640 --> 03:24.223
(somber music)

03:26.442 --> 03:28.859
(Nate sighs)

03:30.860 --> 03:31.710
Tell you a story.

03:33.080 --> 03:34.930
I ain't never told nobody this story.

03:38.883 --> 03:40.323
I need you to keep a secret.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.933
I mean, you can't tell nobody, Trey.

03:48.864 --> 03:50.447
- [Trey] All right.

03:52.746 --> 03:55.970
(Nate sighs)

03:55.970 --> 03:57.703
- Me and your mama came up rough.

04:01.490 --> 04:03.440
Growing up in the '90s was bittersweet.

04:05.760 --> 04:09.723
When our pops went to
prison, things changed.

04:12.040 --> 04:14.840
We moved right in the hood,
right next to the dope spot.

04:20.560 --> 04:24.833
There was always loud
music, parties going on.

04:27.265 --> 04:28.098
It was crazy.

04:31.150 --> 04:33.563
I seen somebody die for a dice game, Trey.

04:36.280 --> 04:38.403
Mama always seemed to make things right.

04:40.590 --> 04:42.543
She always had a smile on her face.

04:43.680 --> 04:47.546
Playing the brand new
cassettes in a boom box.

04:47.546 --> 04:50.580
(hip hop music)

04:50.580 --> 04:53.923
Music blasting, cleaning up the house.

04:56.710 --> 04:58.760
That's probably why I like music so much.

05:03.260 --> 05:04.500
Til Claw came by.

05:06.005 --> 05:09.290
- Can't test me for real.
- I don't fucking like that.

05:09.290 --> 05:11.063
- [Nate Voiceover] My mama boyfriend.

05:13.520 --> 05:16.910
Would abuse us for years,
catch us staring at her,

05:16.910 --> 05:19.260
being like, what you
looking at, little nigger?

05:20.643 --> 05:21.840
- Get in the house.

05:21.840 --> 05:23.220
- [Nate Voiceover] Honestly,
I would dream of the day

05:23.220 --> 05:26.093
I was old enough to beat his
ass for what he did to us.

05:27.800 --> 05:29.973
That'd be a day that'd
change my life forever.

05:32.120 --> 05:33.393
Streets is crazy.

05:40.010 --> 05:41.423
One day Mom and Amina left.

05:49.120 --> 05:50.670
I went through his stuff and...

05:55.589 --> 05:57.907
Found a little weed.

05:57.907 --> 06:00.407
(eerie music)

06:01.783 --> 06:03.023
I just wanted to try it.

06:05.003 --> 06:07.503
(eerie music)

06:08.930 --> 06:09.763
Caught me.

06:12.569 --> 06:14.360
- The fuck is you doing
going through my shit,

06:14.360 --> 06:16.210
smoking my damn weed?

06:16.210 --> 06:18.810
Your mama beat your ass if
she knew you was in here.

06:20.590 --> 06:21.563
- Got me drunk.

06:24.580 --> 06:28.477
- Yeah, little man, yeah,
something to smoke, huh?

06:29.804 --> 06:32.304
(eerie music)

06:35.148 --> 06:36.065
Smoke this.

06:40.603 --> 06:43.168
- Made me smoke PCP with him.

06:43.168 --> 06:45.785
(Claw laughs)

06:45.785 --> 06:48.285
(eerie music)

06:50.670 --> 06:55.670
Mind spinning, luckily I
didn't hit it that hard

06:56.570 --> 06:59.033
but between that and
the handy, I was done.

07:04.988 --> 07:07.010
- How long you been
smoking now, homie, huh?

07:08.613 --> 07:09.446
Huh, nigger?

07:10.950 --> 07:12.520
- Then he tried to kill me.

07:12.520 --> 07:15.130
- Smoke my shit, huh, you
wanna put your hands on me,

07:15.130 --> 07:17.080
nigger, get your ass back here, nigger.

07:17.930 --> 07:20.528
I'll cut you to pieces
right now, motherfucker.

07:20.528 --> 07:23.050
(Nate groans)

07:23.050 --> 07:26.148
(distorted voice) Scared,
little nigger, scared, huh?

07:26.148 --> 07:29.248
You wanna run home to your
mama, little pussy, huh?

07:29.248 --> 07:32.032
(Nate groans)

07:32.032 --> 07:35.040
(Claw cries out)

07:35.040 --> 07:37.833
Oh shit, fuck!

07:40.490 --> 07:41.423
Fuck!

07:43.130 --> 07:43.963
- I ran off.

07:45.550 --> 07:48.283
Everything was spinning. (scoffs)

07:50.767 --> 07:54.230
The whole night was kind of blurry.

07:54.230 --> 07:55.063
- Who are you?

07:56.368 --> 07:59.457
- I woke up in this backyard.
- What are you doing here?

08:00.604 --> 08:05.324
- And there was a little
girl there, tried to help me.

08:05.324 --> 08:07.568
- How'd I get here?

08:07.568 --> 08:09.540
I don't feel--

08:09.540 --> 08:10.373
- Come inside.

08:11.970 --> 08:13.270
I'll have my parents help.

08:14.309 --> 08:16.293
- And then her dad came
out with a shotgun.

08:18.672 --> 08:19.669
- Oh my God.

08:19.669 --> 08:20.603
- That'll be far enough.

08:23.100 --> 08:24.043
- He's lost.

08:27.330 --> 08:31.763
- Abby, get in the house, right now.

08:34.277 --> 08:36.900
- I mean, I'd been called
a nigger before, but--

08:36.900 --> 08:40.809
- Get off my property now,
before you wish you had never

08:40.809 --> 08:42.703
been born, you fucking nigger.

08:46.937 --> 08:49.413
(gun fires)

08:49.413 --> 08:50.746
- That shit cut.

08:53.070 --> 08:54.760
I ran til I couldn't run no more.

08:54.760 --> 08:56.160
- Hey, man, ain't that lil--

08:58.780 --> 09:00.223
- [Nate Voiceover] I passed out again.

09:00.223 --> 09:02.340
- Damn, that is lil Nate.

09:02.340 --> 09:04.234
- Nate, you all right?

09:04.234 --> 09:05.130
- [Nate Voiceover] Then I
remembered my mom and Amina

09:05.130 --> 09:06.820
was coming back.

09:06.820 --> 09:08.757
- He don't smoke weed.
- My weed and shit,

09:08.757 --> 09:10.282
you need to get on him--
- He doesn't do anything.

09:10.282 --> 09:11.735
- [Nate Voiceover] And it hit me.

09:11.735 --> 09:12.568
- Mama.

09:12.568 --> 09:13.401
- I gotta get home.

09:23.941 --> 09:27.191
(Mother shouts within)

09:39.334 --> 09:42.834
When I got there, they was still fighting.

09:44.740 --> 09:47.107
I walked in, he had the devil in his eye.

09:49.580 --> 09:51.280
I knew I was gonna die that night.

09:53.668 --> 09:55.240
- Going through my--
- Check him?

09:55.240 --> 09:56.970
- Check his ass up.
- He's a child!

09:56.970 --> 09:58.778
- There we go.
- No!

09:58.778 --> 10:01.612
No!
- Get the fuck off me.

10:01.612 --> 10:04.362
(crowbar clangs)

10:06.000 --> 10:07.167
- Right there.

10:12.138 --> 10:14.471
(gun fires)

10:46.623 --> 10:49.040
(Amina sobs)

10:50.230 --> 10:51.880
- I seen him laying on the floor.

10:53.284 --> 10:56.040
(eerie music)

10:56.040 --> 10:56.943
Blood everywhere.

10:58.425 --> 11:00.842
(Amina sobs)

11:02.620 --> 11:05.293
- Amina, give me the gun.

11:11.960 --> 11:14.000
- [Nate Voiceover] Just
know that day, your mom

11:14.000 --> 11:15.383
saved all our lives.

11:16.240 --> 11:17.903
- I shot him, you hear me?

11:23.426 --> 11:25.009
- From that day on,

11:26.340 --> 11:28.603
I never touched drugs or a gun again.

11:31.390 --> 11:32.393
I swore, Trey.

11:34.600 --> 11:35.963
If I ever had a family,

11:37.400 --> 11:38.993
I'd be the best father I could,

11:42.260 --> 11:43.763
so I started my business.

11:46.425 --> 11:47.613
And the rest is history.

11:48.631 --> 11:51.214
(somber music)

11:53.050 --> 11:54.950
I never told nobody that story before,

11:56.300 --> 11:58.550
and I'm telling you
'cause you're fucking up.

12:02.480 --> 12:05.440
- Are you serious, Nate? (sighs)

12:05.440 --> 12:07.333
Go upstairs, Trey, now.

12:08.400 --> 12:11.593
- Hey, but it was self defense, all right?

12:13.440 --> 12:15.807
Come by the shop, man,
I wanna see your face.

12:15.807 --> 12:17.557
- I will, Uncle Nate.

12:21.726 --> 12:23.967
- Nate, I'm an attorney
and the last thing I need

12:23.967 --> 12:25.423
is for that story to get out.

12:26.527 --> 12:27.360
- I know.

12:28.679 --> 12:29.829
Trey won't tell nobody.

12:33.450 --> 12:36.447
- [Nate Voiceover] Dear
Pops, I hope by the time

12:36.447 --> 12:39.683
you get this letter, everything's good.

12:42.125 --> 12:44.253
I wanted to write you so many times.

12:45.880 --> 12:47.283
First, I was just upset.

12:48.570 --> 12:49.870
You left when I was a kid.

12:51.470 --> 12:55.163
After Mama passed, just felt
like it's been too long.

12:57.960 --> 13:01.350
I would ask myself, what would you think

13:01.350 --> 13:02.443
about me now writing?

13:04.660 --> 13:07.480
I received your letters, and yes,

13:07.480 --> 13:09.053
of course you can stay with us.

13:11.650 --> 13:12.683
I'm married now.

13:13.650 --> 13:15.053
I got a beautiful wife.

13:16.604 --> 13:18.162
Her name's Tatiana.

13:18.162 --> 13:19.625
(trumpet music)

13:19.625 --> 13:20.817
And a son, Nate Junior.

13:22.847 --> 13:23.924
He's 13.

13:23.924 --> 13:26.591
(trumpet music)

13:27.567 --> 13:29.483
He was born deaf, but
it never held him back.

13:32.265 --> 13:34.450
He's now learning to read lips.

13:34.450 --> 13:36.922
He loves baseball and video games.

13:36.922 --> 13:39.589
(trumpet music)

13:57.777 --> 14:01.115
- All right, look, man, keep
your eye on it, all right?

14:01.115 --> 14:04.317
Here, use your heart, man, come on.

14:04.317 --> 14:06.900
(somber music)

14:09.158 --> 14:11.040
Yeah, like that, like that,
throw with your heart,

14:11.040 --> 14:12.758
stay with it.

14:12.758 --> 14:15.341
(somber music)

14:22.518 --> 14:24.030
(Nate sighs)

14:24.030 --> 14:24.863
- He's good.

14:26.790 --> 14:27.813
You taught him good.

14:28.918 --> 14:30.400
(Nate sighs)

14:30.400 --> 14:32.323
- That boy, he's too big.

14:35.790 --> 14:37.960
We gotta do something
with his hair, though,

14:37.960 --> 14:39.293
cut all this off.

14:39.293 --> 14:42.243
- No, no, you look at
this hair, he's the same.

14:43.193 --> 14:45.776
(somber music)

14:55.803 --> 14:58.443
- [Nate Voiceover] I
know Mama, rest in peace,

14:59.730 --> 15:01.513
always said you was a good man,

15:03.210 --> 15:04.710
just a victim of circumstance.

15:08.360 --> 15:10.360
I've always tried to keep my nose clean.

15:11.320 --> 15:12.520
Own my own business now.

15:13.920 --> 15:15.463
I got four employees.

15:16.660 --> 15:19.060
Maybe I could teach you
how to work on cars too.

15:25.010 --> 15:27.960
I understand how easy it is to
get caught up in the system.

15:29.610 --> 15:32.060
The other day I was picking
up a friend from work

15:33.150 --> 15:34.793
when two cops pulled us over.

15:38.220 --> 15:41.330
- License and registration, right now.

15:41.330 --> 15:42.973
- Man, this is some bullshit.

15:50.780 --> 15:52.400
- Chicago.

15:52.400 --> 15:53.670
- Really, you're not from around here.

15:53.670 --> 15:55.129
- Nah.

15:55.129 --> 15:56.033
- So what are you doing here, then?

16:08.740 --> 16:10.202
See what we got in these pockets,

16:10.202 --> 16:12.619
keep your hands out of your
pockets, put your hands up,

16:12.619 --> 16:14.550
put 'em on the hood.

16:14.550 --> 16:15.670
- [Nate Voiceover] Apparently
there was a robbery

16:15.670 --> 16:20.303
around the corner, couple
black guys, mid 20s.

16:23.300 --> 16:24.483
We fit the description.

16:26.130 --> 16:29.420
- We had a bad night sometimes,
all right, it happens?

16:29.420 --> 16:31.650
- [Nate Voiceover] I got a
red 300, they're looking for

16:31.650 --> 16:36.203
a Camaro, believe it or not,
he helped me out that night.

16:36.203 --> 16:38.870
(hip hop music)

16:53.956 --> 16:56.706
(shutter clicks)

17:00.141 --> 17:02.724
(phone chirps)

17:04.319 --> 17:05.153
- Sam.

17:10.369 --> 17:12.869
I think we should let Becca
go out with her friends again.

17:12.869 --> 17:14.730
It's been long enough.

17:14.730 --> 17:16.630
- Why the fuck are you whispering?

17:16.630 --> 17:17.567
- I just--

17:18.797 --> 17:19.796
- You don't need to whisper.

17:19.796 --> 17:20.628
We're the parents, remember?

17:21.597 --> 17:24.116

17:25.362 --> 17:26.613

- No.

17:28.279 --> 17:29.620
I'm fine, it's just eight hours on a beat

17:29.620 --> 17:30.520
and now this shit?

17:31.778 --> 17:34.957
- Hey, well, just stay calm
and no arguments, okay?

17:34.957 --> 17:37.437
- I'm calm. (sighs)

17:37.437 --> 17:39.013
Fuck, all right, let's just
get this shit over with.

17:50.694 --> 17:53.370

have something we would like

17:53.370 --> 17:54.203
to tell you.

17:56.090 --> 17:57.650
- Your mother and I have
agreed to let you go out

17:57.650 --> 17:59.460
with your friends, but on the condition

17:59.460 --> 18:00.960
that you stop seeing Mohammed.

18:05.073 --> 18:05.906
- But Dad.

18:05.906 --> 18:07.420
- You know what, this is not negotiable.

18:09.454 --> 18:10.623
- (scoffs) It never is.

18:13.719 --> 18:15.757
- You want to tiptoe and whisper
around this fucking house?

18:15.757 --> 18:16.590
You deal with her.

18:20.860 --> 18:21.693
- I hate him.

18:22.717 --> 18:25.217
(eerie music)

18:46.578 --> 18:48.862

18:48.862 --> 18:51.212
- Sam, good to see you,
thanks for coming down.

18:52.378 --> 18:53.378
- As always.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.773
- Sam, I appreciate you coming.

18:59.022 --> 19:00.080
I've got a little bit of a problem.

19:00.080 --> 19:01.930
I really could use your help with it.

19:04.450 --> 19:07.080
My sister's kid, my nephew,
he seems to have got himself

19:07.080 --> 19:10.780
mixed up into a drug
deal, something went bad

19:10.780 --> 19:13.730
and it's related to some
guys in your department.

19:13.730 --> 19:16.580
He's locked up in county but
they haven't sent it over

19:16.580 --> 19:19.693
to the DA's office yet, so
there's still some time.

19:23.570 --> 19:24.403
- Yeah.

19:26.090 --> 19:27.780
You're gonna owe me, all right?

19:28.737 --> 19:30.487
- Yeah, you got it, yeah, anything.

19:32.076 --> 19:34.576
(eerie music)

19:41.465 --> 19:43.269
- This is fucking bullshit.

19:43.269 --> 19:45.930
- Shit, it ain't here.

19:45.930 --> 19:47.146
- Did you check the engine?

19:47.146 --> 19:48.826
- I checked the whole fucking car.

19:48.826 --> 19:50.586
- It's all right.
- It's fucking bullshit.

19:50.586 --> 19:51.419
- They ain't gonna find nothing, man.

19:51.419 --> 19:53.370
- Hey, hey, where's it at,

19:53.370 --> 19:54.826
where'd you hide your fucking stash?

19:54.826 --> 19:55.824
- I don't know what you're
talking about, officer.

19:55.824 --> 19:56.951
- Oh, you don't know
what I'm talking about?

19:56.951 --> 19:58.060
I've been following you for fucking weeks.

19:58.060 --> 19:59.240
Where's the stash, boy?

19:59.240 --> 20:01.158
- You don't know shit, kid, shit.

20:01.158 --> 20:02.440
- How 'bout you, how 'bout you?

20:02.440 --> 20:03.824
You know what I'm talking about, huh,

20:03.824 --> 20:04.657
you know what I'm talking about?

20:04.657 --> 20:05.710
- Won't say shit.
- I've seen you go on

20:05.710 --> 20:07.760
ride alongs together for two weeks now.

20:07.760 --> 20:09.024
- Get back in the house, now!

20:09.024 --> 20:11.117
- Oh, no, no, no.
- Check it out.

20:11.117 --> 20:14.121

down, get back in the house,

20:14.121 --> 20:15.730
put the fucking phone down.

20:15.730 --> 20:18.913
- Ain't nobody scared of
you, what is wrong, Officer?

20:20.178 --> 20:24.383
- Put the fucking phone down,
put the fucking phone down.

20:24.383 --> 20:26.588
Give me that motherfucking phone.

20:26.588 --> 20:27.498
- Are you serious?

20:27.498 --> 20:28.840
- You're gonna let him
put a gun to his head?

20:28.840 --> 20:29.972
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Settle the fuck down.

20:29.972 --> 20:33.180
- Whoa, everybody be cool,
partner, hey, hey, okay, look,

20:33.180 --> 20:35.040

- If you care about your
brother, I'm gonna need you

20:37.250 --> 20:39.273
to step back, back up.
- I'm going, I'm backing up,

20:40.417 --> 20:41.250
all right?
- This is bullshit!

20:41.250 --> 20:43.053
- All right, chill.
- Crooked ass shit.

20:44.136 --> 20:45.300
- Y'all free to go, sorry
for the inconvenience.

20:45.300 --> 20:49.278
- Hey, hey, remember me,
Officer, 'cause I'ma see you

20:49.278 --> 20:52.695

20:53.699 --> 20:56.299
I'ma see on the street,

20:58.616 --> 21:00.011

21:00.011 --> 21:00.995
Did you really have to do that?

21:00.995 --> 21:04.680
- I got your badge, I'ma see you, bitch.

21:04.680 --> 21:05.513
- Let's go right now.

21:05.513 --> 21:08.013
(eerie music)

21:14.530 --> 21:16.570

21:20.280 --> 21:22.543

21:23.570 --> 21:26.290

21:26.290 --> 21:29.670

21:29.670 --> 21:30.503
Okay?

Okay, again, sorry 'bout that.

heard my mother tell my father

22:42.080 --> 22:47.010
she was having another
baby, the fear inside me...

22:50.115 --> 22:52.415
And then I heard my
father say, get rid of it.

22:53.530 --> 22:56.987
During dinner I watched my
mother, I wanted to help her.

22:59.089 --> 23:01.672

Keep this pistol, keep this pistol.

23:26.231 --> 23:29.145

23:29.145 --> 23:31.273

one but we gotta go now!

23:31.273 --> 23:32.393

25:51.952 --> 25:54.360
- You know what, the fucking
head thing, what the fuck,

25:54.360 --> 25:55.870
looks like he's calling you over.

25:55.870 --> 25:59.017
- It's a hood thing, like what's up.

25:59.017 --> 25:59.850
- All right, whatever.

25:59.850 --> 26:02.100
- How am I supposed to do it?

26:02.100 --> 26:03.603
- You do it in a downward motion, like.

26:04.550 --> 26:06.198
Like they do in England.

26:06.198 --> 26:09.010

- [Woman] President Trump has a rally

26:10.560 --> 26:11.750
that he's planning tonight

26:11.750 --> 26:14.060
in Phoenix Arizona in
the midst of heightened

26:14.060 --> 26:16.860
political tensions due to the
violence in Charlottesville

26:16.860 --> 26:19.412

26:19.412 --> 26:23.412

26:27.280 --> 26:29.040
- [Reporter] Mayor Greg
Stanton has recently

26:29.040 --> 26:31.330
been in the news and the
headlines for asking Trump

26:31.330 --> 26:33.910
to delay his campaign style rally.

26:33.910 --> 26:36.570
In a recent CBS interview,
he said I believe

26:36.570 --> 26:39.880
the true intention is really
to inflame people's passion

26:39.880 --> 26:41.770
to further divide the country

26:41.770 --> 26:43.440
and that's why I said this president

26:43.440 --> 26:45.270
should delay this trip to Phoenix.

26:45.270 --> 26:48.010
President Trump is drawing
criticism from both sides

26:48.010 --> 26:50.850
of the aisle based on his
statements for wanting to pardon

26:50.850 --> 26:52.457
Sheriff Joe Arpaio.

26:52.457 --> 26:54.957
(eerie music)

27:14.798 --> 27:17.640

27:17.640 --> 27:19.237

27:23.918 --> 27:25.930
They just out there for Mose.

27:25.930 --> 27:28.840

can't just go do what they do

27:28.840 --> 27:30.240
somewhere else.

27:30.240 --> 27:31.443

- I'm trying to go to the NBA.
- Right on.

30:55.290 --> 30:56.749
- Junior here?

30:56.749 --> 30:57.773
- He upstairs, go ahead.

30:57.773 --> 30:59.370
- All right, hey, auntie.
- Hey, baby.

31:02.253 --> 31:04.177
- I'm be back.

31:04.177 --> 31:06.760
(somber music)

31:20.820 --> 31:22.120
- That guy looks familiar.

31:23.114 --> 31:25.697
(somber music)

31:41.232 --> 31:43.982
(shutter clicks)

31:45.770 --> 31:48.573
- [Nate Voiceover] By now I
know you heard what happened.

31:49.510 --> 31:50.343
It's everywhere.

31:52.030 --> 31:54.133
I don't know how shit
like this can happen.

31:55.779 --> 31:58.529
(dramatic music)

32:03.960 --> 32:08.170
- Hey, for real, bro, nigger,
look, I got dreads, nigger,

32:08.170 --> 32:10.580
tattoos, bro, you think
they ain't out here

32:10.580 --> 32:13.910
stereotyping me, pfft, this
real in the field, bro,

32:13.910 --> 32:17.522

shit's happening right now.

32:17.522 --> 32:20.022
(Nate knocks)

32:21.699 --> 32:22.532
- Mose.

32:27.818 --> 32:30.318
(Nate knocks)

32:31.700 --> 32:32.850
- Hey, door, my nigger.

32:34.542 --> 32:35.375
- Then get it, nigger.

32:38.803 --> 32:40.782
- Bro.
- What up?

32:40.782 --> 32:43.699
You good?
- Yeah, man, I'm straight.

32:48.950 --> 32:50.890
- What's up, man, you wanna
go with me to the store,

32:50.890 --> 32:51.723
get a game?

32:55.402 --> 32:57.440
- [Nate Voiceover] I knew
that damn gun'd be a problem.

32:59.290 --> 33:01.720
It's why I threw that shit away.

33:01.720 --> 33:04.577
- Whoo, man, what up, what up, Mo?

33:06.824 --> 33:07.990
- My nigger, my nigger,
what's good, my nigger?

33:07.990 --> 33:10.060
- Man, I'm good, y'all loud.

33:10.060 --> 33:12.584
- Nigger, you know it's all legal.

33:12.584 --> 33:14.446
It's medical shit, my nigger, we good.

33:14.446 --> 33:15.670
- You might wanna tell the
boys up the street, though,

33:15.670 --> 33:16.503
they watching you.

33:16.503 --> 33:18.530
- Fuck all that, hit this shit, my nigger.

33:19.501 --> 33:21.760
- Nah, I don't smoke, bro, I
had a bad experience as a kid.

33:21.760 --> 33:22.700
- [Nate Voiceover] Somebody gave it to him

33:22.700 --> 33:26.260
for his birthday, psst,
I didn't want that gun

33:26.260 --> 33:27.710
to be nowhere near the house.

33:31.737 --> 33:32.973
If only I would've known.

33:34.024 --> 33:36.607
(somber music)

33:45.710 --> 33:49.613
- Lifted it six inches, gutted
it out, man, stripes on it,

33:49.613 --> 33:51.043
you good to go, it's live, it's live.

33:51.043 --> 33:52.960
- Hey, hey.
- Door, nigger.

33:52.960 --> 33:54.340
- Nigger, you get the door, what the fuck,

33:54.340 --> 33:56.755
you see me and this nigger talking, bro.

33:56.755 --> 33:58.056
- Now get the door, foo.

33:58.056 --> 34:00.333
(man knocks)

34:00.333 --> 34:02.032
- Hey, how much I owe you, bro?

34:02.032 --> 34:03.032
- Three, yeah, yeah.

34:03.933 --> 34:06.516
(somber music)

34:10.275 --> 34:11.108
- 'Sup.

34:11.108 --> 34:12.050
- Yo, can we talk to Uncle Nate?

34:12.050 --> 34:13.260
- Yeah, hold on.

34:13.260 --> 34:15.763
Hey, yo, Nate, somebody
at the door for you.

34:20.333 --> 34:22.630
- Hey, man, yeah, just

34:22.630 --> 34:27.091
you come pick it up.
- It's for you, Nate.

34:27.091 --> 34:28.424
- For me?
- Yeah.

34:31.580 --> 34:32.813
- A'ight, hey, I'll be back.

34:36.387 --> 34:38.639
What are you doing, what
are y'all doing, huh?

34:38.639 --> 34:40.440
I told you, don't come to the house.

34:42.029 --> 34:43.723
- What's he doing with his
hands, what's that, gang signs?

34:45.286 --> 34:47.027
- Calm down, Sam, calm down.

34:47.027 --> 34:48.860
- Hey, man, don't tell me to
be fucking calm, all right?

34:48.860 --> 34:51.120
They're all in cahoots, the
kid's probably a fucking runner.

34:51.120 --> 34:53.030
- Get back to the house now.

34:53.030 --> 34:53.862
What are y'all doing?

34:53.862 --> 34:55.239
- Man, we just need some
money, we trying to go get

34:55.239 --> 34:56.253
some video games.

34:58.624 --> 34:59.704
- Video games.

34:59.704 --> 35:00.954
- Video games, that's it.

35:02.925 --> 35:03.924
- Here.

35:03.924 --> 35:04.757
- It's gotta be calm.

35:04.757 --> 35:06.840
- Don't fucking tell me to
be calm, just, look, yeah,

35:06.840 --> 35:08.483
he just handed that kid something.

35:09.752 --> 35:10.680
- You're going through a
lot right now, brother,

35:10.680 --> 35:11.733
you need to calm down.

35:11.733 --> 35:14.568
- Hey, you watch over him, all right?

35:14.568 --> 35:17.235
- You know I got him, I got him.

35:19.640 --> 35:22.440
- You know what, why are you
always trying to one up me?

35:23.331 --> 35:24.164
Always trying to me shut me
down, every fucking thing

35:24.164 --> 35:26.380
that comes out of my
mouth, I know what I saw.

35:27.789 --> 35:30.372
(somber music)

36:13.561 --> 36:15.085
(gun cocks)

36:15.085 --> 36:16.335
- [Sam] Freeze!

36:24.772 --> 36:27.492
(ears ring)

36:27.492 --> 36:29.831
(gun fires)

36:29.831 --> 36:32.414
(somber music)

36:34.208 --> 36:37.765
- [Castillo Over radio]
Shots fired, shots fired.

36:37.765 --> 36:40.348
(somber music)

36:46.165 --> 36:48.165
This is Officer Castillo,
please send backup,

36:48.165 --> 36:50.684
we're gonna need an ambulance.

36:50.684 --> 36:53.267
(somber music)

36:55.386 --> 36:59.626
The child looks about
12 years old, maybe 13,

36:59.626 --> 37:02.117
I think he had a toy gun,
Sam thought it was a weapon

37:02.117 --> 37:05.946
but it was a toy, send somebody, quick.

37:05.946 --> 37:10.863
(no audio)
(somber music)

37:35.640 --> 37:36.913
- Fucking piece of shit.

37:42.000 --> 37:44.683
- You got any tequila?
- Right where you left it.

37:53.950 --> 37:56.000
I didn't think you were gonna call again.

37:57.062 --> 37:59.645
(somber music)

38:15.032 --> 38:17.365
(Sam sighs)

38:18.853 --> 38:19.686
- You see the news?

38:19.686 --> 38:21.720
- I mean, nothing that
caught my attention, why?

38:23.672 --> 38:27.196
(Sam clears his throat)

38:27.196 --> 38:28.613
- I killed a kid.

38:31.220 --> 38:34.113
I thought he had a gun, I
mean, he did have a gun, fuck!

38:35.676 --> 38:36.509
- Hey.

38:36.509 --> 38:38.500
- The kid had a gun, he was
pointing it at another kid,

38:38.500 --> 38:40.503
I thought it was a real gun.

38:41.690 --> 38:43.663
- Sam, you killed a kid with a toy?

38:46.660 --> 38:48.578
- It looked like a real gun to me.

38:48.578 --> 38:49.493
- So then it was a mistake.

38:50.380 --> 38:52.410
- Oh, that's shit, no one's buying that.

38:52.410 --> 38:54.880
- Sam, calm down.
- Don't fucking tell me

38:54.880 --> 38:57.335
to be calm, this is my fucking life!

38:57.335 --> 38:59.276
(ears ring)

38:59.276 --> 39:02.330
- (muffled) Sam, someone died.

39:02.330 --> 39:04.680
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, hey.

39:09.778 --> 39:12.500
This shit can go all wrong.

39:12.500 --> 39:14.350
I don't need anybody coming after me.

39:16.418 --> 39:21.251
(eerie music)
(Sam pants)

39:51.439 --> 39:54.297
(audience applauds)

39:54.297 --> 39:58.560
- Nate Wesley Junior, a
young man tragically murdered

39:58.560 --> 40:00.620
in our community, and I'm certain by now

40:00.620 --> 40:02.730
you have heard the story.

40:02.730 --> 40:06.830
Officer Sam Lynch, the
officer who shot and murdered

40:06.830 --> 40:10.100
Nate Wesley Junior on an assumption

40:10.100 --> 40:13.820
and that assumption was
that Nate Wesley Junior

40:13.820 --> 40:16.890
was carrying a loaded weapon.

40:16.890 --> 40:20.390
And by the way, Officer
Sam Lynch did not realize

40:20.390 --> 40:23.780
that Nate Wesley Junior was also deaf

40:23.780 --> 40:25.850
and could not communicate
effectively with him

40:25.850 --> 40:26.973
in that situation.

40:28.510 --> 40:31.480
Ladies and gentlemen, we must have reform

40:31.480 --> 40:34.200
in our law enforcement
so that officers come out

40:34.200 --> 40:38.330
of the law enforcement
community ready and able

40:38.330 --> 40:41.210
to disseminate and break down situations

40:41.210 --> 40:44.430
without having to use deadly force.

40:44.430 --> 40:48.570
It's a tragic event and
should never have happened.

40:48.570 --> 40:50.900
That's the final thought for this evening.

40:50.900 --> 40:52.410
Thanks for joining us.

40:52.410 --> 40:54.617
We look forward to seeing
you tomorrow night.

40:54.617 --> 40:57.753
(audience applauds)

40:57.753 --> 41:00.336
(somber music)

41:06.210 --> 41:08.063
- Hey, Sam, how you doing?

41:08.960 --> 41:10.380
Good to see you.

41:10.380 --> 41:12.230
So listen, how you holding up, buddy?

41:14.070 --> 41:17.130
- I mean, fucking media's
dragging me through the streets.

41:17.130 --> 41:19.280
- I been there, and
they're gonna do that, too,

41:19.280 --> 41:20.497
but that's why it's important
that you get out there

41:20.497 --> 41:22.540
and get your story out, okay?

41:22.540 --> 41:24.650
I've seen the media, and
they're gonna paint this picture

41:24.650 --> 41:25.483
however they want to.

41:25.483 --> 41:26.483
- Yeah, tell me about
it, they're calling me

41:26.483 --> 41:28.470
a fucking racist, I got a black Pastor,

41:28.470 --> 41:29.510
I'm not a fucking racist, all right?

41:29.510 --> 41:31.170
- Hey, hey, that's bullshit, okay?

41:31.170 --> 41:33.130
I've known you for years
and you're not a racist.

41:33.130 --> 41:34.810
Listen, you just got to get out there

41:34.810 --> 41:36.680
and tell your side of the story, okay?

41:36.680 --> 41:39.384
Don't let anybody twist
your words for you.

- [Pastor] My brothers, my
sisters we're gathered here today

43:13.820 --> 43:18.430
to funeralize our brother,
Nathaniel Wesley Junior

43:18.430 --> 43:21.123
affectionately known as young Nate Junior.

43:23.470 --> 43:28.470
We are saddened, we sit
here in awe of the events

43:30.672 --> 43:32.005
that took place.

43:35.270 --> 43:37.930
- Okay, can I have
everybody's attention here?

43:37.930 --> 43:41.060
Officer Lynch is going
to make a short statement

43:41.060 --> 43:43.290
and then he'll take some questions.

43:43.290 --> 43:44.123
Officer Lynch?

43:54.113 --> 43:57.140
- Ladies and gentlemen of the press,

43:57.140 --> 43:59.030
on behalf of the city police department,

43:59.030 --> 44:02.350
I would like to apologize
for the tragic events

44:02.350 --> 44:03.863
that have brought us here today.

44:05.091 --> 44:07.350
(organ music)

44:07.350 --> 44:10.050
- We have to talk about
the situations that

44:10.050 --> 44:14.420
are really going on, senseless deaths

44:14.420 --> 44:16.153
that shouldn't be taking place,

44:17.520 --> 44:20.203
our young Nate was full of life.

44:22.120 --> 44:24.070
His life was brought down way too soon.

44:27.010 --> 44:31.490
There's things that young Nate
will never get to experience.

44:31.490 --> 44:34.230
- As tragic as these
events are, I still contend

44:34.230 --> 44:36.817
that I behaved within the
bounds of police protocol.

44:36.817 --> 44:40.264
(group shouts questions)

44:40.264 --> 44:41.097
- Okay, okay, quiet down, one at a time.

44:42.279 --> 44:43.360
- Young Nate Junior...

44:45.560 --> 44:49.503
Was a young boy full of life,

44:51.280 --> 44:55.020
full of great opportunity,
and it was snatched away

44:56.897 --> 44:59.140
at the hands of someone who was

45:00.640 --> 45:03.137
supposed to protect and serve.

45:03.137 --> 45:04.430
- Officer, were you aware
that the boy was deaf

45:04.430 --> 45:06.550
at the time that you shot him?

45:06.550 --> 45:09.077
- I was not aware that
the boy was deaf, no.

45:09.077 --> 45:10.610
- Officer Lynch, Officer Lynch.

45:10.610 --> 45:11.950
Have you had an opportunity to speak

45:11.950 --> 45:13.200
with the boy's parents yet?

45:13.200 --> 45:15.240
- [Sam] I have not yet had
an opportunity to speak

45:15.240 --> 45:16.500
with the boy's parents.

45:16.500 --> 45:18.300
- Officer Lynch, do you intend to speak

45:18.300 --> 45:19.690
to the boy's family?

45:19.690 --> 45:21.740
- He'll never get a chance to go to prom.

45:22.730 --> 45:25.010
We'll never get to see
him walk across that stage

45:25.010 --> 45:26.510
and graduate from high school.

45:28.380 --> 45:30.800
He'll never get a chance to walk onto

45:30.800 --> 45:33.653
a college campus and
experience life on his own.

45:35.520 --> 45:38.193
He'll never get a chance to
meet the love of his life.

45:39.530 --> 45:42.260
He'll never get a chance
to stand at the altar

45:42.260 --> 45:45.750
and watch his bride walk down the aisle.

45:45.750 --> 45:47.777
- Look, I did what I
thought had to be done.

45:47.777 --> 45:49.440
Any good cop would've
done the exact same thing.

45:49.440 --> 45:51.410
- Okay, okay, okay, no more
questions, no more questions,

45:51.410 --> 45:54.737
no more, no more, he's done, he's done.

45:54.737 --> 45:57.320
(somber music)

45:58.279 --> 46:00.840
- Y'all, I wrote this song
in honor of Nate Junior

46:02.759 --> 46:07.170

and reflection of his life

48:52.220 --> 48:53.523
- Still fucking that cop?

48:54.510 --> 48:56.140
- Man, why are you
butting into my business?

48:56.140 --> 48:57.270
You're not my dad.

48:57.270 --> 48:59.175
- You know that
motherfucker's married, right?

48:59.175 --> 49:01.673
- Shh, quiet, I have neighbors.

49:03.538 --> 49:04.371
- Man, you always fucking fall in love

49:04.371 --> 49:05.750
with the wrong fucking people, man.

49:07.171 --> 49:08.010
This motherfucker got a family at home.

49:08.010 --> 49:08.923
He has kids.

49:10.014 --> 49:11.975
(woman sighs)

49:11.975 --> 49:14.270
You need to stop fucking doing that shit.

49:14.270 --> 49:15.892
- Whatever, man.

49:15.892 --> 49:18.642
- This motherfucker's a cop, man.

49:23.561 --> 49:25.894
(Sam sighs)

49:26.876 --> 49:29.319
- Where have you been?

49:29.319 --> 49:34.319
- On a stakeout, official
police business, you know?

49:34.418 --> 49:36.773
- Do you really think I'm stupid?

49:36.773 --> 49:38.270
- Rachel, I can't do
this tonight, all right?

49:38.270 --> 49:39.860
I have enough shit going
on in my life right now

49:39.860 --> 49:42.093
without you turning against me too.

49:43.596 --> 49:45.100
- Mom, is everything okay?

49:45.100 --> 49:46.900
- Everything's fine, go back to bed.

49:50.670 --> 49:52.020
- You wanna know the truth?

49:52.919 --> 49:54.410
Do you really want to
know the truth, Rachel?

49:54.410 --> 49:56.740
- Yeah, tell me, stop lying to me, Sam,

49:56.740 --> 49:57.840
and tell me the truth.

50:01.510 --> 50:03.110
- I fuck her every chance I get.

50:06.658 --> 50:07.491
I'm not happy.

50:08.410 --> 50:10.260
I haven't been happy for a long time.

50:11.510 --> 50:13.610
I don't know if we can pick up the pieces.

50:14.610 --> 50:17.510
Right, there, that's the truth,
you fucking satisfied now?

50:18.738 --> 50:19.571
Huh?

50:22.199 --> 50:24.340
(Sam sighs)

50:24.340 --> 50:25.173
- Hey, Sam.

50:26.290 --> 50:27.190
How are you doing?

50:28.210 --> 50:29.800
- Good, good.

50:29.800 --> 50:33.310
- You just take my lead,
I've got your back,

50:33.310 --> 50:36.199
and everything's gonna be all right, okay?

50:36.199 --> 50:37.196
- Okay.

50:37.196 --> 50:38.696
- You can do this.

50:52.170 --> 50:54.270
- As long as I've known
you, I ain't never known you

50:54.270 --> 50:55.470
to fuck up on no brakes.

50:57.940 --> 51:00.470
Gwen just called me and
said she almost crashed

51:00.470 --> 51:01.303
on the freeway.

51:06.446 --> 51:08.363
- Tell her I'll fix it.

51:09.545 --> 51:10.723
- Bro, you need to go home.

51:13.006 --> 51:14.700
You need to spend time
with your family, man.

51:14.700 --> 51:18.413
I love them like you, I've
known you for a long time, bro.

51:19.670 --> 51:20.503
You go home.

51:26.767 --> 51:29.862
♪ Love me the way ♪

51:29.862 --> 51:31.342
♪ The way that you do ♪

51:31.342 --> 51:32.942
- I haven't seen you smile in a long time.

51:32.942 --> 51:34.204
- Mmm.

51:34.204 --> 51:37.120
(crowd claps)

51:37.120 --> 51:40.030
- Now next up on the mic,
this sisters rocks mics

51:40.030 --> 51:41.830
all over the United
States, one of the best

51:41.830 --> 51:45.123
to ever do it, I want you to
please give it up for Divine.

51:45.123 --> 51:45.956
- We're gonna get through this.

51:45.956 --> 51:48.539
(group cheers)

51:52.544 --> 51:53.590
(woman sighs)

51:53.590 --> 51:58.123
- This poem is dedicated to
Nate and Tatiana. (sighs)

52:01.140 --> 52:05.880
I've missed you, thought about
you when I wasn't supposed to

52:07.370 --> 52:12.370
I cared, I watched you walk
away that day to play and smile

52:13.180 --> 52:15.713
and your silence was loud.

52:16.820 --> 52:18.580
You were special.

52:18.580 --> 52:21.140
And not many people knew how.

52:21.140 --> 52:22.423
And some didn't care.

52:23.570 --> 52:26.670
They took you right from under me,

52:26.670 --> 52:31.670
the system, the system
wasn't built for you or me.

52:31.670 --> 52:33.223
They offered no apology.

52:34.250 --> 52:35.503
My baby is gone.

52:36.870 --> 52:39.213
Your heartbeat was my favorite song.

52:40.660 --> 52:43.000
Missing you hasn't been fun.

52:43.000 --> 52:45.300
I mean, I try to substitute
for you in your absence,

52:45.300 --> 52:50.300
but no one else can do what
you do, love how you love and

52:50.480 --> 52:51.803
look how you look.

52:52.740 --> 52:53.853
I want you back.

52:54.760 --> 52:58.940
With you there was balance,
a sense of security,

52:58.940 --> 53:02.763
even if it lasted a little
while, I wanted you with me.

53:04.040 --> 53:07.959
'Cause I get that things
change and people part ways,

53:07.959 --> 53:12.677
but we were one, so
division wasn't an option.

53:13.810 --> 53:17.870
Son, I now know the
meaning when someone says

53:17.870 --> 53:19.223
they feel torn apart.

53:20.660 --> 53:24.310
Feeling like your finish
line never had a start.

53:26.063 --> 53:27.066
Thank you.

53:27.066 --> 53:28.122
(audience applauds)

53:28.122 --> 53:29.663
Come on, guys, come on.

53:29.663 --> 53:32.246
(somber music)

53:42.830 --> 53:44.330
- [Nate Voiceover] You know
they say in ancient times that

53:45.560 --> 53:47.850
the sun would be fighting the moon

53:47.850 --> 53:49.700
and then the moon would fight the sun

53:50.780 --> 53:52.933
but the solar system has to have balance.

53:55.929 --> 53:57.943
A person can only bend
so much til they break.

53:58.850 --> 54:00.510
If the sun woke up this morning

54:01.500 --> 54:03.063
and its shine was taken away,

54:04.360 --> 54:06.260
he would question his whole existence.

54:08.820 --> 54:12.550
If I break, I want the
crackling of my roots

54:12.550 --> 54:14.443
to resonate throughout the universe.

54:18.930 --> 54:21.290
- [Reporter] Breaking
news, Officer Sam Lynch

54:21.290 --> 54:22.650
will not be charged

54:22.650 --> 54:25.643
in the shooting death
of Nate Wesley Junior.

54:26.606 --> 54:28.070
- [Sam] I feel entirely
justified in my actions.

54:28.070 --> 54:31.890
Kid was a known drug runner
hanging out with known criminals

54:31.890 --> 54:34.400
My question is, where are
the parents in all this, huh?

54:34.400 --> 54:36.270
- [Reporter] Protestors
are already on scene

54:36.270 --> 54:37.570
from both sides.

54:37.570 --> 54:40.350
We will keep you up to
date on the very latest.

54:40.350 --> 54:43.600
(somber trumpet music)

55:08.235 --> 55:12.860
- What's happening with you,
man, how you holding up?

55:12.860 --> 55:15.130
- You know they down there
marching for you, man,

55:15.130 --> 55:17.717
I'm surprised you ain't at the march.

55:17.717 --> 55:19.587
- Fuck marches.

55:19.587 --> 55:21.743
- Man, fuck all that marching, bro.

55:22.610 --> 55:23.633
Marching for what?

55:24.690 --> 55:28.180
The police don't police
they own, so we'll never get

55:28.180 --> 55:30.433
no conviction, we'll never get no justice.

55:32.059 --> 55:33.856
- Shit, feel me?

55:33.856 --> 55:36.356
(eerie music)

56:11.667 --> 56:13.667
- What's up, Nate?
- Bro.

56:16.630 --> 56:17.773
- T-Moe in there?

56:18.646 --> 56:21.729
(Nate bangs on door)

56:26.670 --> 56:28.697
- What's up, man?
- Man.

56:28.697 --> 56:30.710
- Need a strap, y'all.
- Need a strap?

56:30.710 --> 56:32.560
- I need a strap, you got one or not?

56:34.430 --> 56:35.263
- You all right?

56:36.540 --> 56:37.373
- Good, man.

56:39.491 --> 56:40.491
- All right.

56:45.740 --> 56:46.573
Where you at?

56:48.260 --> 56:51.927
You need to get over here right
now, yeah, like right now.

56:54.611 --> 56:55.444
All right.

57:05.540 --> 57:06.523
- How you find me?

57:07.400 --> 57:08.900
- T-Moe's my friend, remember?

57:12.180 --> 57:14.920
Nate, I know you're not about
to do what I'm thinking.

57:14.920 --> 57:15.840
- What's that?

57:15.840 --> 57:17.063
- Listen to me.

57:17.950 --> 57:18.960
- What?

57:18.960 --> 57:20.780
- Don't do this.

57:20.780 --> 57:22.000
I'm in that courtroom every day.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.930
I know how this ends, it's not
worth throwing away your life

57:28.200 --> 57:30.850
- Put a hole in his chest,
I'm supposed to walk away?

57:32.180 --> 57:33.630
Huh?

57:33.630 --> 57:35.680
We kill each other every day for bullshit

57:36.700 --> 57:39.850
and now what, I'm supposed
to march and protest and

57:39.850 --> 57:41.853
sing peace songs, fuck that shit.

57:43.632 --> 57:44.883
I ain't turning the other cheek.

57:46.240 --> 57:47.563
That shit stops today.

57:48.750 --> 57:49.783
I'ma ride for mine.

57:51.420 --> 57:52.253
- Then what?

57:53.180 --> 57:54.013
Hmm?

57:55.430 --> 57:59.210
You plan on having me represent
you on a murder one charge?

57:59.210 --> 58:00.760
Pleading with the judge to forgive you

58:00.760 --> 58:03.130
and not give you the death penalty?

58:03.130 --> 58:05.480
Where's the honor in that?

58:05.480 --> 58:07.730
Our father spent most
of our lives in prison.

58:08.940 --> 58:09.940
Ask him about honor.

58:12.010 --> 58:13.980
This is your life.

58:13.980 --> 58:15.283
This isn't a game, Nate.

58:17.171 --> 58:19.588
(Nate sighs)

58:23.485 --> 58:24.760
- You know what?

58:24.760 --> 58:26.260
We either stand for something,

58:28.690 --> 58:30.980
we gonna keep dying
for nothing, excuse me.

58:32.751 --> 58:35.251
(Amina sighs)

58:37.240 --> 58:38.853
- So what happened?

58:41.020 --> 58:43.970
- Nobody wants to hang out with
me because of what Dad did.

58:45.760 --> 58:47.853
They're calling him a murderer.

58:51.790 --> 58:53.803
I seriously can't take it anymore.

58:55.150 --> 58:56.343
And where is he?

58:58.990 --> 59:00.640
Mom, I heard you guys
talking the other night

59:00.640 --> 59:02.740
and I know that he's seeing another woman.

59:06.150 --> 59:09.480
- It's complicated.
(girl scoffs)

59:09.480 --> 59:12.890
It breaks my heart to know
that you're going through this.

59:12.890 --> 59:16.873
Kids can be so mean, no one's
hazing you though, right?

59:18.760 --> 59:22.269
- Nobody says that, they just...

59:22.269 --> 59:23.680
(bell rings)

59:23.680 --> 59:24.513
Unlike you.

59:26.560 --> 59:28.910
They don't like your
comments or your photos

59:28.910 --> 59:30.223
on social media.

59:32.360 --> 59:35.240
They whisper.
(dog barks)

59:35.240 --> 59:37.260
This fucking dog.

59:37.260 --> 59:39.060
Shut up, Cowboy.

59:39.060 --> 59:41.693
- Go untie him and bring him in the house.

59:41.693 --> 59:42.693
- This is so stupid.

59:43.693 --> 59:46.193
(eerie music)

59:48.291 --> 59:51.331
(Rachel sniffles)

59:51.331 --> 59:54.700
- You know, they're not
really your friends.

59:54.700 --> 59:56.893
Oh don't, no, no-
- Sit the fuck down.

59:56.893 --> 59:57.830
- Stop, stop!
- Sit down, sit down.

59:57.830 --> 01:00:00.573
Go check the house,
bro, go check the house.

01:00:00.573 --> 01:00:02.743
Where the fuck is he at?
- Who, who?

01:00:02.743 --> 01:00:05.133
- Who, Sam, where the fuck is at?

01:00:05.133 --> 01:00:06.872
- I don't know.
- Where is he at?

01:00:06.872 --> 01:00:08.720
- [Rachel] He's not here, I don't know.

01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:09.570
- Where is he at?

01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:13.512
Call him, call him.
- Okay, yeah, okay.

01:00:13.512 --> 01:00:15.143
- Get him on the phone.
- I'm calling, I'm calling.

01:00:16.747 --> 01:00:19.030
(phone buzzes)

01:00:19.030 --> 01:00:21.530
(eerie music)

01:00:28.260 --> 01:00:29.233
He's not answering, sorry, it's not him.

01:00:32.424 --> 01:00:35.091
- Fuck.
- What you wanna do, bro?

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:42.847
- You ever been robbed of something?

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:47.623
Has somebody ever stole
something from you?

01:00:49.930 --> 01:00:51.290
Yeah?

01:00:51.290 --> 01:00:52.800
I'm not talking about your fucking car

01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:54.981
or your little place at the country club.

01:00:54.981 --> 01:00:56.731
I mean some shit you can't replace.

01:01:01.630 --> 01:01:03.980
He used to steal my heart
every time he smiled.

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:10.617
His first steps--

01:01:12.755 --> 01:01:15.189
I can't replace that shit.

01:01:15.189 --> 01:01:16.133
Do you believe in the Bible?

01:01:17.550 --> 01:01:20.330
Do you believe in the fucking Bible?

01:01:20.330 --> 01:01:21.580
- [Rachel] Yes.

01:01:24.510 --> 01:01:26.327
- Well, it says an eye for an eye.

01:01:27.950 --> 01:01:30.623
A tooth for a tooth.

01:01:33.690 --> 01:01:34.593
I've been fighting.

01:01:37.450 --> 01:01:38.423
I've been fighting.

01:01:48.289 --> 01:01:51.430
If I take something
from him, I'll be even.

01:01:51.430 --> 01:01:53.930
(eerie music)

01:02:14.477 --> 01:02:16.236
(girl sobs)

01:02:16.236 --> 01:02:19.888
- Jesus Christ, Jesus
Christ, you hurt, baby?

01:02:19.888 --> 01:02:21.837
You all right, hold on, hold on.

01:02:21.837 --> 01:02:24.170
(girl sobs)

01:02:31.533 --> 01:02:32.366
You okay, you all right?

01:02:33.911 --> 01:02:36.244
(girl sobs)

01:02:38.034 --> 01:02:39.415
(Rachel cries out)

01:02:39.415 --> 01:02:41.095
What happened, who did this?

01:02:41.095 --> 01:02:42.263
- It was--
- I'll kill them.

01:02:42.263 --> 01:02:44.810
- Just some black guys with guns.

01:02:44.810 --> 01:02:47.591
Where were you, I called you.

01:02:47.591 --> 01:02:48.889
Where the fuck were you?

01:02:48.889 --> 01:02:51.309
They were pointing a gun
at your daughter, okay,

01:02:51.309 --> 01:02:52.393
and you were gone, you were gone.

01:02:53.831 --> 01:02:56.031
It's probably those
guys's son you murdered.

01:02:57.286 --> 01:02:58.322
We should call the police.

01:02:58.322 --> 01:03:03.239
(ears ring)
(eerie music)

01:03:08.838 --> 01:03:10.340
We need to call the police.

01:03:10.340 --> 01:03:13.355
- No, look, baby, baby,
I'm the police, all right?

01:03:13.355 --> 01:03:15.272
I'ma take care of this.

01:03:16.998 --> 01:03:19.593
It's all right.
- It's your fault.

01:03:19.593 --> 01:03:21.237
(Rachel sobs)

01:03:21.237 --> 01:03:23.675
- Motherfuckers, motherfuckers!

01:03:23.675 --> 01:03:26.592
(foreboding music)

01:03:51.154 --> 01:03:53.487
(Sam pants)

01:03:55.570 --> 01:03:57.671
- Sorry, man, we're
closed, come back tomorrow.

01:03:57.671 --> 01:04:01.831
- [Sam] You just couldn't let it go, huh?

01:04:01.831 --> 01:04:04.393
Come into my home, tie
up my wife, my daughter?

01:04:09.870 --> 01:04:11.003
- You murdered my son.

01:04:13.810 --> 01:04:14.643
In cold blood!

01:04:19.351 --> 01:04:20.830
I coulda did the same to you.

01:04:23.010 --> 01:04:24.010
I'm not like you, though.

01:04:24.010 --> 01:04:25.820
- Hey, boss, I'm going.

01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:27.453
Oh, shit.

01:04:27.453 --> 01:04:29.648
(gun fires)

01:04:29.648 --> 01:04:30.481
- Back the fuck up!

01:04:32.050 --> 01:04:32.883
Go on, get outta here.

01:04:40.413 --> 01:04:43.746
- [Man] Hey, you see what he did, right?

01:04:46.930 --> 01:04:47.920
- This is Officer Sam
Lynch, we've got shots fired

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:52.920
in Nate's Garage, 1703
West 24th Ave. (pants)

01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:55.533
Need medical assistance.

01:04:59.530 --> 01:05:01.280
- [Reporter] This is Cadence
Harper with the LA broadcast

01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:03.687
network and we are here live on the scene

01:05:03.687 --> 01:05:04.520
at Nate's Garage.

01:05:04.520 --> 01:05:06.010
We have just learned
that Nate Wesley Senior

01:05:06.010 --> 01:05:09.550
has been shot after an altercation
with Officer Sam Lynch.

01:05:09.550 --> 01:05:10.930
If you remember--

01:05:10.930 --> 01:05:11.954
(man's speech distorted)

01:05:11.954 --> 01:05:13.590
Officer Sam Lynch is the same
officer in the deadly shooting

01:05:13.590 --> 01:05:16.460
of Nate Wesley Junior
for wielding a toy gun.

01:05:16.460 --> 01:05:19.610
The question is, why is
Officer Sam Lynch at the shop?

01:05:19.610 --> 01:05:21.650
Details are sketchy, but
in a statement released

01:05:21.650 --> 01:05:24.500
by Officer Sam Lynch, he
said that he went to the shop

01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:27.930
to apologize but Nate Wesley
Senior pulled out a gun

01:05:27.930 --> 01:05:29.260
and he was forced to shoot him.

01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:31.570
We still don't know the
condition of Nate Wesley Senior,

01:05:31.570 --> 01:05:34.810
but we do know that he is in
police custody and hospitalized

01:05:40.754 --> 01:05:42.370
(man sighs)

01:05:42.370 --> 01:05:43.593
- That's what happened.

01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:47.860
I'm sorry, I...

01:05:50.730 --> 01:05:51.713
I can't leave.

01:05:53.420 --> 01:05:54.323
I can't leave my family.

01:05:55.750 --> 01:06:00.017
It made me realize what--

01:06:05.319 --> 01:06:09.652
When you see your family's
lives flash before you...

01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:15.123
- So you leading me on this whole time?

01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:19.233
- No. (sighs)

01:06:21.910 --> 01:06:23.487
That's not what I mean, I--

01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:30.943
I need to be there for my wife.

01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:34.760
My daughter, I'm sorry, this is...

01:06:36.439 --> 01:06:39.960
(woman sniffles)

01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:40.793
Look, I--

01:06:44.855 --> 01:06:46.880
I can give you some money,
if you want to get away

01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:47.713
for a while.

01:06:48.615 --> 01:06:50.400
- Where am I supposed to go, Sam?

01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:51.473
And leave my family?

01:06:52.414 --> 01:06:54.081
Where am I gonna go?

01:06:56.455 --> 01:06:57.777
(Sam sighs)

01:06:57.777 --> 01:07:00.277
(eerie music)

01:07:07.496 --> 01:07:08.329
Really?

01:07:09.432 --> 01:07:12.515
I don't want your fucking money, Sam.

01:07:15.677 --> 01:07:16.510
- Fine.

01:07:20.861 --> 01:07:21.694
I'm sorry.

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:24.797
(woman sniffles)

01:07:24.797 --> 01:07:26.513
- Have a drink with me
for old time's sake?

01:07:28.898 --> 01:07:30.648
- I don't think that's a good idea.

01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:38.381
All right, okay, it's
okay, it's all right.

01:07:38.381 --> 01:07:40.798
(woman sobs)

01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:54.800
(Sam exhales)

01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:57.217
(Sam laughs)

01:08:02.024 --> 01:08:07.024
- I gotta tell you I am relieved,
fucking relieved. (laughs)

01:08:11.970 --> 01:08:13.140
The system works.

01:08:13.140 --> 01:08:15.140
- You think this could actually be over?

01:08:16.810 --> 01:08:20.523
- It's like, I don't know
what I was so worried about.

01:08:22.779 --> 01:08:25.069
All I had to do was just...

01:08:26.705 --> 01:08:29.420
Fucking, just put it on the ground.

01:08:31.930 --> 01:08:33.140
- Put what on the ground, Sam?

01:08:33.140 --> 01:08:38.140
- The gun, the fucking
unlicensed, untraceable,

01:08:38.490 --> 01:08:42.330
it's always good to have one
on hand in my line of work.

01:08:45.486 --> 01:08:48.069
(somber music)

01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:05.080
- Sam Lynch decided to show
up at Nathan Wesley Senior's

01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:07.399
shop to apologize, first
of all, who does that?

01:09:07.399 --> 01:09:09.060
I mean, I guess I can
kind of see it, you know,

01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:11.020
you want to be the bigger
man and make that appearance

01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:14.229
and I do understand it,
but it's just, it's such,

01:09:14.229 --> 01:09:16.250
so soon, fam, so soon?

01:09:16.250 --> 01:09:18.620
Listen, an altercation took place.

01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:21.330
Nate Wesley was shot and
Sam Lynch is claiming that

01:09:21.330 --> 01:09:23.720
a gun was pulled on him, a little suspect,

01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:25.359
listen, phone lines are open, call us up,

01:09:25.359 --> 01:09:27.893
tell us what you think, I
don't know who to believe.

01:09:47.904 --> 01:09:49.237
- How you doing?

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:54.212
- Pretty shaken up. (sighs)

01:09:56.388 --> 01:09:59.364
(Sam sighs)

01:09:59.364 --> 01:10:01.410
- Well, you ain't got
to worry no more, okay?

01:10:01.410 --> 01:10:04.723
They got the guy, he's gonna
be going away for a long time.

01:10:07.350 --> 01:10:08.363
- What about you?

01:10:12.340 --> 01:10:14.923
Are you going away too?

01:10:23.398 --> 01:10:25.481
- I'm not going anywhere.

01:10:27.520 --> 01:10:32.520
- What about Yolanda or Yesenia, whatever?

01:10:32.610 --> 01:10:35.193
(somber music)

01:10:37.584 --> 01:10:39.917
(Sam sighs)

01:10:41.141 --> 01:10:42.141
- It's over.

01:10:44.064 --> 01:10:45.103
I told her last night.

01:10:47.584 --> 01:10:48.981
It's in the past.

01:10:48.981 --> 01:10:51.564
(somber music)

01:10:54.758 --> 01:10:55.675
I love you.

01:10:58.583 --> 01:11:00.139
- I love you too.

01:11:00.139 --> 01:11:02.722
(somber music)

01:11:33.143 --> 01:11:34.470
- [Pastor] I need y'all
to turn with me today

01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:37.560
to Galatians six and
seven, the word of God

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:40.610
said be not deceived, God is not mocked

01:11:40.610 --> 01:11:44.160
for whatever a man soweth,
that shall he also reap.

01:11:44.160 --> 01:11:47.820
Understand, the devil
wants you to act and react

01:11:47.820 --> 01:11:50.580
based on reactions, but
understand God says,

01:11:50.580 --> 01:11:52.610
whatever you plant, if you plant positive,

01:11:52.610 --> 01:11:55.000
you'll reap positive,
if you plant negative,

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.740
you'll reap negative, God
is not playing with us.

01:11:57.740 --> 01:12:00.460
God will make you pay for
the things that you do.

01:12:00.460 --> 01:12:03.070
You better understand,
God is a God of justice,

01:12:03.070 --> 01:12:06.730
God is a God of compassion,
he's not a God of confusion,

01:12:06.730 --> 01:12:10.090
but he will make you pay for what you do.

01:12:10.090 --> 01:12:12.855
You will reap what you sow.

01:12:12.855 --> 01:12:14.710
You got to understand, God is not mocked.

01:12:14.710 --> 01:12:16.920
I'ma reaching out trying to save you

01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:18.330
while there's still time.

01:12:18.330 --> 01:12:21.255
You better do what's right
in the eyes of the Lord.

01:12:21.255 --> 01:12:26.255
(piano music)
(no audio from Pastor)

01:12:40.294 --> 01:12:42.877
(somber music)

01:12:46.358 --> 01:12:49.775
- [Sam] The gun, unlicensed, untraceable.

01:12:53.275 --> 01:12:56.253
It's always handy to keep one
handy while you're working.

01:12:59.731 --> 01:13:01.540
- You recognize the
name Officer Sam Lynch?

01:13:01.540 --> 01:13:02.670
It's in the news again.

01:13:02.670 --> 01:13:05.370
If you are one of the 18
million people who has not

01:13:05.370 --> 01:13:09.420
seen this video that was released
on YouTube three days ago,

01:13:09.420 --> 01:13:12.038
pay attention, there is graphic language,

01:13:12.038 --> 01:13:14.235
this is a warning.

01:13:14.235 --> 01:13:18.223
- A gun, unlicensed, untraceable.

01:13:20.310 --> 01:13:24.290
It's always handy to keep
one handy while I work.

01:13:24.290 --> 01:13:27.330
It's actually kind of (beep)

01:13:29.230 --> 01:13:33.777
I told him I went over there
to apologize. (sniffles)

01:13:37.777 --> 01:13:38.690
- Let's follow the timeline on this story.

01:13:38.690 --> 01:13:41.500
As you might remember, Officer
Sam Lynch back in the spring

01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:44.810
shot and killed a 12 year
old deaf boy by the name--

01:13:44.810 --> 01:13:47.979
- Man, I knew that
motherfucker was no good, man.

01:13:47.979 --> 01:13:49.240
- The grand jury heard the
case and he was acquitted.

01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:51.810
A few months later,
Officer Sam Lynch goes down

01:13:51.810 --> 01:13:55.430
to the office of Nate Wesley
Senior, the boy's father,

01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:57.530
to apologize for the incident.

01:13:57.530 --> 01:14:00.580
Officer Lynch claims that
the father, Wesley Senior,

01:14:00.580 --> 01:14:04.170
pulled a gun on him and
in defense, he shot him.

01:14:04.170 --> 01:14:07.419
Well, this video tells a
different story, doesn't it?

01:14:07.419 --> 01:14:08.252
- I've got your discharge paperwork here

01:14:08.252 --> 01:14:09.270
if you'd like to sign it.

01:14:12.270 --> 01:14:13.560
- [Reporter] After the
release of this video,

01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:15.790
Officer Sam Lynch was
arrested and is now being--

01:14:15.790 --> 01:14:17.940
- Ladies and gentlemen if
you haven't had a chance

01:14:17.940 --> 01:14:20.590
this afternoon to view any
of the major news networks

01:14:20.590 --> 01:14:24.350
or hear anybody talking in the
office by the water cooler,

01:14:24.350 --> 01:14:26.060
well, you're gonna see it tonight.

01:14:26.060 --> 01:14:29.140
Sam Lynch has been released
from the county jail.

01:14:29.140 --> 01:14:31.440
He must have made bond because he was seen

01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:32.890
exiting the jail this evening.

01:14:32.890 --> 01:14:36.160
If you remember the infamous
YouTube video that was released

01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:39.630
about a week ago showing
video footage of Mr. Lynch

01:14:39.630 --> 01:14:42.700
talking about planting
evidence at a crime scene,

01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:47.400
filmed, wait for it, by his
mistress with her cell phone,

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:50.180
well, that's all resurfacing
again this evening

01:14:50.180 --> 01:14:52.330
and the nightmare continues for Ms. Lynch

01:14:52.330 --> 01:14:54.510
and I'm sure she is very unhappy

01:14:54.510 --> 01:14:56.400
with the news media tonight.

01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:57.760
(muffled applause from TV)

01:14:57.760 --> 01:15:00.343
(somber music)

01:15:25.891 --> 01:15:26.724
- Yesenia!

01:15:33.747 --> 01:15:35.164
Yesenia, open up!

01:15:38.662 --> 01:15:39.495
Please.

01:15:44.322 --> 01:15:47.072
(dramatic music)

01:15:56.168 --> 01:15:57.680
- Hey, fool, why you
banging on my sister's door?

01:15:57.680 --> 01:15:59.923
You know she don't want
to see you no more, homie.

01:16:04.150 --> 01:16:05.863
Yeah, you better bounce, motherfucker.

01:16:06.846 --> 01:16:09.429
(somber music)

01:16:15.447 --> 01:16:16.320
- [Nate Voiceover] There's
a funny feeling inside

01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:17.833
when you stop giving a fuck.

01:16:20.386 --> 01:16:22.920
When you just stop caring about the world

01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:24.640
because you realize the
world don't give a fuck

01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:25.633
about you either.

01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:28.373
It's almost unnatural.

01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:32.793
I used to read the Bible a lot.

01:16:34.669 --> 01:16:37.860
And my mind keeps going back
to a scripture I remember.

01:16:37.860 --> 01:16:41.740
To everything there's a season and a time

01:16:41.740 --> 01:16:43.253
to every purpose under heaven.

01:16:45.808 --> 01:16:48.290
A time to be born, a time to plant,

01:16:48.290 --> 01:16:50.103
a time to pluck up that is planted.

01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:54.850
And it also says there's a time to kill.

01:16:54.850 --> 01:16:57.800
- Well, first, I want to thank
you for taking this meeting.

01:17:00.670 --> 01:17:03.240
I was formally charged a couple days ago

01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:05.607
and suspended from work and--

01:17:07.482 --> 01:17:09.800
I understand that you
were assigned my case,

01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:12.400
I'm supposed to appear
before you, so I was hoping--

01:17:14.660 --> 01:17:16.810
You might be able to help me out.

01:17:16.810 --> 01:17:19.980
- Sam, I know you did me a favor,

01:17:19.980 --> 01:17:22.103
but you're real hot on this one.

01:17:24.706 --> 01:17:26.200
The public is out for blood
and the media's all over this.

01:17:26.200 --> 01:17:28.470
I cannot help you on this one.

01:17:28.470 --> 01:17:30.023
- You can't help me?

01:17:30.023 --> 01:17:31.180
You owe me, I got your
nephew out of prison.

01:17:31.180 --> 01:17:32.653
- I understand that, look.

01:17:33.970 --> 01:17:35.730
I'm gonna ask you nicely and quietly.

01:17:35.730 --> 01:17:36.790
I think you need to leave.

01:17:36.790 --> 01:17:39.341
I shouldn't even be
seen with you right now.

01:17:39.341 --> 01:17:42.658
- You think I need to--

01:17:42.658 --> 01:17:43.758
- You need to go, Sam.

01:17:45.620 --> 01:17:49.793
You fucked up, you really
fucked up, you planted evidence.

01:17:52.370 --> 01:17:53.833
I can't make that go away.

01:17:55.730 --> 01:17:59.300
- That man came into my home,
he terrorized my family.

01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:00.470
What was I supposed to do?

01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:02.470
- You were supposed to
let the law handle it.

01:18:02.470 --> 01:18:03.303
- I--

01:18:04.684 --> 01:18:06.134
I'm a fucking police officer.

01:18:07.490 --> 01:18:10.150
I served my country.
(ears ring)

01:18:10.150 --> 01:18:11.653
I'm a proud American.

01:18:14.430 --> 01:18:15.793
And this is how I'm treated?

01:18:17.300 --> 01:18:19.581
You're just gonna throw me under the bus?

01:18:19.581 --> 01:18:21.030
- Look, he's a good kid,
he just made a mistake

01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:23.380
and I'd really appreciate
it if you could help me

01:18:23.380 --> 01:18:24.580
get him out of this jam.

01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:27.593
- Yeah.

01:18:29.563 --> 01:18:30.562
- Yeah?

01:18:30.562 --> 01:18:31.565
- But you're gonna owe me.

01:18:31.565 --> 01:18:32.810
- Nothing I can do for you, Sam.

01:18:32.810 --> 01:18:35.567
I'm putting myself at risk
just by meeting with you.

01:18:42.023 --> 01:18:44.940
(foreboding music)

01:19:56.650 --> 01:19:58.330
- [Nate Voiceover] With
everything that is within me

01:19:58.330 --> 01:19:59.913
telling me not to give a fuck,

01:20:01.390 --> 01:20:03.560
telling me to make you
feel a fraction of the pain

01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:05.473
that you put me and my family through,

01:20:07.340 --> 01:20:09.363
pain that keeps me up at night.

01:20:11.805 --> 01:20:14.455
The pain that brought me
here, right here, right now.

01:20:16.460 --> 01:20:21.244
I want the world to know that
it's your time, motherfucker.

01:20:21.244 --> 01:20:23.077
- [Sam] Let me go, no!

01:20:24.980 --> 01:20:25.813
- [Nate Voiceover] I watched him struggle

01:20:25.813 --> 01:20:27.060
as they laid him down on the ground.

01:20:28.925 --> 01:20:31.575
I thought how easy it'd be
just to end his existence.

01:20:33.605 --> 01:20:37.753
It's at those moments that
you gotta reach deep inside,

01:20:39.226 --> 01:20:41.426
the part that goes
beyond not giving a fuck.

01:20:44.057 --> 01:20:47.110
And I knew it was my time
to release all the pain

01:20:47.110 --> 01:20:48.673
that I felt about Nate Junior.

01:20:50.642 --> 01:20:53.142
(eerie music)

01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:13.613
- Watch your back.

01:21:42.343 --> 01:21:45.093
- Hey, hey, slow down, slow down.

01:21:47.710 --> 01:21:51.413
Aw, ese, ain't that
motherfucking pig right there?

01:21:54.620 --> 01:21:55.816
That's him.

01:21:55.816 --> 01:21:58.066
- That is him, that
motherfucker right there.

01:22:00.343 --> 01:22:04.401
- Pull up, pull up, ese, pull up, pull up.

01:22:04.401 --> 01:22:05.660
Remember me?

01:22:05.660 --> 01:22:10.020
(gun fires)
(Sam grunts)

01:22:10.020 --> 01:22:12.603
(somber music)

01:22:16.230 --> 01:22:19.180
- [Man] If you died today,
would they remember you for you?

01:22:20.210 --> 01:22:23.133
Or judge you for who
they thought you were?

01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:30.270
Growing up, you became
accustomed to chaos.

01:22:35.590 --> 01:22:37.363
Your mother lost her life to it.

01:22:43.469 --> 01:22:44.869
But the way the world works,

01:22:46.020 --> 01:22:47.533
subtract and you add to it.

01:22:52.712 --> 01:22:55.153
A father holds his baby boy in
his arms for the first time.

01:22:56.480 --> 01:22:58.730
Millions of thoughts
racing through his head.

01:23:00.450 --> 01:23:02.700
I can't wait to teach
him how to ride a bike.

01:23:04.170 --> 01:23:05.720
Show him how to play some ball.

01:23:07.970 --> 01:23:10.170
Him telling you about
the girls in his life.

01:23:12.260 --> 01:23:14.460
What kinda impact will
he make on the world?

01:23:18.230 --> 01:23:19.680
Kinda makes you smile, right?

01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:24.690
Can you imagine raising
your son to be the man

01:23:24.690 --> 01:23:27.860
you always knew he could be,
just for a coward with a gun

01:23:27.860 --> 01:23:28.933
to take him away?

01:23:31.280 --> 01:23:32.603
Black lives matter.

01:23:35.900 --> 01:23:38.300
The news'll tell you it's just
a bunch of thugs and hoodlums

01:23:38.300 --> 01:23:43.200
breaking shit, as if my
black life was a choice.

01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:45.693
See, America, you lack empathy.

01:23:47.210 --> 01:23:50.233
So allow me to emphasize the
thoughts of my motor mind, see.

01:23:51.460 --> 01:23:53.700
You tell my people to be
quiet when our children

01:23:53.700 --> 01:23:55.373
are being killed, why?

01:23:57.250 --> 01:23:58.203
Better him than me.

01:23:59.970 --> 01:24:03.523
You see it on the news, our
children being dehumanized, why?

01:24:04.390 --> 01:24:05.563
This isn't news to me.

01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:10.310
This has been a problem, except
now it's being televised.

01:24:10.310 --> 01:24:12.670
Fox is telling hella
lies and America acting

01:24:12.670 --> 01:24:15.410
like they seeing through
Hellen Keller's eyes.

01:24:15.410 --> 01:24:16.760
See, my view is omniscient.

01:24:17.992 --> 01:24:19.093
I seen it all, I seen it all.

01:24:21.146 --> 01:24:22.269
Seems like the only way out the hood

01:24:22.269 --> 01:24:23.630
is slinging rock or slinging a ball.

01:24:23.630 --> 01:24:25.940
And not all cops are bad,

01:24:25.940 --> 01:24:28.280
but man, I know it seems as such

01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:29.580
'cause they're killing off our genes

01:24:29.580 --> 01:24:31.649
and it's lost between the scenes.

01:24:31.649 --> 01:24:33.080
It sucks, it seems to
me that what the world

01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:34.253
is lacking is love.

01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:39.750
What you hear and what you see
is a distraction from love.

01:24:39.750 --> 01:24:42.500
What you say and how you
feel, I feel is actually love.

01:24:43.549 --> 01:24:45.903
And I hope you feel it
from a passage above, love.

01:24:46.985 --> 01:24:49.568
(somber music)

01:25:56.387 --> 01:25:59.054
