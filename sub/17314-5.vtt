00:13.420 --> 00:16.500
Tonight, we completely save
the countryside.

00:16.500 --> 00:19.660
James and I completely ruin London.

00:19.660 --> 00:22.900
And there be dragons
in the reasonably priced car.

00:29.020 --> 00:31.900
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

00:31.900 --> 00:33.580
Hello! Hello and welcome!

00:33.580 --> 00:37.140
And we start tonight
where we finished off last week,

00:37.140 --> 00:39.700
with the incredible Nissan GT-R.

00:39.700 --> 00:41.220
Really.

00:41.220 --> 00:45.700
We know that this car is faster
round the Nuerburgring

00:45.700 --> 00:48.620
than a Porsche 911 Turbo,
which costs twice as much.

00:48.620 --> 00:52.060
We know it's faster across Japan
than the bullet train.

00:52.060 --> 00:55.700
But what we don't know, cos
last week I was on the public roads

00:55.700 --> 00:58.460
and it was fitted with
an electronic speed muzzle,

00:58.460 --> 01:01.660
is what it's like when you
really put your foot down.

01:01.660 --> 01:03.620
So when the race was over,

01:03.620 --> 01:08.020
I stayed in Japan for an extra day
to see if I could find out.

01:15.940 --> 01:18.580
This is the Fuji race circuit.

01:18.580 --> 01:20.980
There's no speed limit here.

01:20.980 --> 01:22.780
No traffic either.

01:22.780 --> 01:24.620
And best of all,

01:24.620 --> 01:28.220
no need to be worried
by the Nissan speed governor.

01:30.900 --> 01:35.660
On normal roads, all Japanese cars

01:36.980 --> 01:42.660
But the GT-R satnav system knows
when it gets to a racetrack...

01:44.980 --> 01:46.820
..And simply turns the limiter off.

01:49.980 --> 01:53.220
First of all, I must apologise
for the sunglasses.

01:53.220 --> 01:56.780
This is because yesterday I picked
up a hideous eye infection.

01:56.780 --> 01:59.020
And I really don't think
you want to see it.

01:59.020 --> 02:01.220
This though I think
you do want to see.

02:01.220 --> 02:03.860
Flap your paddle gearbox
into manual.

02:03.860 --> 02:06.780
We put the gearbox itself
into race mode,

02:06.780 --> 02:08.820
the suspension into race mode,

02:08.820 --> 02:12.140
we put that button down
to engage the launch control.

02:12.140 --> 02:14.620
Left foot on the brake.
Build up the revs.

02:14.620 --> 02:16.220
Here we go!

02:19.900 --> 02:20.980
God!

02:22.860 --> 02:25.820
It's hard to say how much power
the GT-R develops,

02:25.820 --> 02:29.380
because each engine,
as I said last week, is hand built.

02:29.380 --> 02:32.220
Each one is therefore
a little bit different.

02:33.700 --> 02:36.860
But I think they put
a million horsepower in this one,

02:36.860 --> 02:42.260
because the acceleration is
just blistering. It's just savage!

02:43.020 --> 02:44.780
God! Face-ripping!

02:45.380 --> 02:48.020
With the launch control engaged,

02:48.020 --> 02:51.060
I did 0-60
in three and a half seconds.

02:51.060 --> 02:54.300
And flat out,
it's even more impressive.

02:59.940 --> 03:05.740
Partly that's down to the million
horsepower 3.8 litre twin turbo V6.

03:05.740 --> 03:08.300
And partly it's down
to the shape of the body.

03:10.580 --> 03:14.660
It looks like a discordant mess,
like Stravinsky designed it.

03:14.660 --> 03:19.060
But every crease and every angle,
even on the door mirrors,

03:19.060 --> 03:22.420
is there to channel air
to that big rear spoiler.

03:24.300 --> 03:29.420
The result is absolute stability
and a top speed of...

03:29.420 --> 03:32.020
Well, since this track
has the longest straight

03:32.020 --> 03:35.140
of any Grand Prix circuit,
let's find out.

03:38.180 --> 03:41.140
160kph there.

03:41.140 --> 03:42.660
90!

03:42.660 --> 03:44.060
220...

03:44.060 --> 03:45.140
Come on!

03:45.140 --> 03:46.260
240!

03:47.340 --> 03:50.380
Into sixth gear at 250kph.

03:50.380 --> 03:52.220
260... 275...

03:52.220 --> 03:54.900
I'm on the brakes.

03:56.260 --> 03:59.860
It will eventually do 193mph,

03:59.860 --> 04:03.380
and that's impressive for a car
that's quiet and comfortable,

04:03.380 --> 04:06.540
a car with four seats and a boot.

04:06.540 --> 04:08.420
And it's especially impressive

04:08.420 --> 04:11.660
when you think it wasn't really
built for straight line speed.

04:11.660 --> 04:15.340
Mostly it was built to mash
your mind in the corners.

04:18.620 --> 04:23.580
The axles are assembled
on hydraulic rigs that replicate
the weight of the car,

04:23.580 --> 04:25.180
so the geometry is bang on

04:25.180 --> 04:28.700
before the suspension
is bolted to the body.

04:30.580 --> 04:34.500
It uses its yaw sensor and
G-sensor to measure actual yaw rate,

04:34.500 --> 04:37.620
and can then adjust
the DampTronic shock absorbers

04:37.620 --> 04:40.660
and the four-wheel drive system
every hundredth of a second

04:40.660 --> 04:43.900
to bring the car into line
with a pre-ordained target.

04:45.700 --> 04:47.980
I don't understand any of that.

04:47.980 --> 04:50.380
But I do understand this.

04:50.380 --> 04:53.980
The GT-R can corner
so fast and so violently,

04:53.980 --> 04:57.860
each wheel has
a special knurling on the rim

04:57.860 --> 04:59.620
to stop the tyres coming off.

05:04.060 --> 05:09.140
It is extremely hard
to explain how this feels.

05:09.140 --> 05:11.380
Agony is probably the best word.

05:11.380 --> 05:16.180
The onboard readout is telling me
that in that last corner

05:16.180 --> 05:21.100
I generated one and a fifth
more sideways gravity.

05:22.380 --> 05:27.500
I wish my collar had a knurled rim -
it would stop my head coming off!

05:29.180 --> 05:32.580
When you really get going
at this kind of speed,

05:32.580 --> 05:35.020
you expect to feel detached
from the action,

05:35.020 --> 05:38.740
like you're playing a video game,
just pressing buttons.

05:38.740 --> 05:41.140
But incredibly, it feels mechanical.

05:41.140 --> 05:43.860
It feels analogue, it feels human.

05:45.740 --> 05:48.500
It feels fan-bleeding-tastic!

05:54.300 --> 05:57.500
I thought when I drove
the Mitsubishi Evo-10 the other day

05:57.500 --> 06:02.380
that there was no way the GT-R
could be worth twice as much money.

06:02.380 --> 06:06.820
I just thought there's no way
it could be twice as good.

06:06.820 --> 06:08.100
But it is.

06:08.100 --> 06:09.180
And some!

06:10.260 --> 06:12.740
They haven't built a new car here,

06:12.740 --> 06:14.740
they've build a new yardstick.

06:19.540 --> 06:21.980
Now at this point
I was going to tell you

06:21.980 --> 06:24.380
about the incredible brakes
and the turbo whistle,

06:24.380 --> 06:27.780
and how Lotus secretly developed
the spine of this car.

06:27.780 --> 06:32.220
But before I had a chance,
I had a bit of a problem.

06:33.420 --> 06:35.300
Agh!

06:38.700 --> 06:41.100
My neck's just gone.

06:53.380 --> 06:55.700
What I need is painkillers.

06:56.740 --> 06:59.220
Honestly, I hate to cause
the fuss because...

07:01.740 --> 07:03.340
APPLAUSE

07:06.700 --> 07:10.380
You hopeless old fart -
a Datsun broke your neck!

07:10.380 --> 07:11.820
It was already weakened,

07:11.820 --> 07:14.220
from endlessly craning down
to listen to you.

07:14.220 --> 07:15.860
LAUGHTER

07:15.860 --> 07:15.940
Amazing rescue service
they've got there, isn't it?

07:15.940 --> 07:18.340
I was very pleased to see that
someone had brought a lawnmower.

07:21.300 --> 07:22.580
And a bin lorry.

07:22.580 --> 07:25.140
The dustbin lorry did put
the fear of God into me.

07:25.140 --> 07:28.420
Much like I did with them actually
when I took my sunglasses off -

07:28.420 --> 07:31.140
"Oh, look at his eye,
it's disgusting!"

07:31.140 --> 07:32.580
I'll tell you the problem.

07:32.580 --> 07:38.140
You know a lot of modern cars have
those headlamps that swivel when
you turn the steering wheel? Yes.

07:38.140 --> 07:40.540
Do you know why the GT-R
doesn't have that?

07:40.540 --> 07:41.900
Save weight?

07:41.900 --> 07:45.420
No, it's because the motors in that
sort of headlamp can't keep up

07:45.420 --> 07:48.020
with the speed that thing
changes direction.

07:48.020 --> 07:51.900
Honestly, it's just unbelievable.
It corners faster than electricity.

07:51.900 --> 07:55.340
Wouldn't it be great to know how
fast it would go round our track?

07:55.340 --> 07:58.100
Yeah, problem is,
you think it's in Japan.

07:58.100 --> 08:02.740
But it isn't. We've flown it 9,000
miles so it can be here today

08:02.740 --> 08:04.860
in the hands
of our tame racing driver.

08:04.860 --> 08:08.340
Now some say that
he isn't allowed by law

08:08.340 --> 08:12.260
within a hundred yards
of Lorraine Kelly.

08:12.260 --> 08:13.780
LAUGHTER

08:13.780 --> 08:17.300
And that he's never seen
an episode of Top Gear,

08:17.300 --> 08:20.300
because he's a huge fan
of Midsomer Murders.

08:21.460 --> 08:23.980
All we know is he's called Bergerac.

08:25.220 --> 08:28.140
And he's off! Now remember,
this £53,000 car

08:28.140 --> 08:31.860
has monstered a 300g McLaren
round the Nuerburgring.

08:31.860 --> 08:35.500
But I doubt it will do that here,
because this is a power circuit.

08:35.500 --> 08:37.620
Very tidy through the first corner.

08:37.620 --> 08:40.860
Stig's neck, of course,
made of weapons grade titanium.

08:44.620 --> 08:48.660
And he's still all over Elton John.
Let's hope he showers afterwards.

08:48.660 --> 08:51.940
That is planted around Chicago.
A little wiggle on the way out.

08:51.940 --> 08:54.860
Hammerhead - will the big V6
upfront drag it wide?

08:54.860 --> 08:57.980
Not a chance.

08:57.980 --> 09:00.900
Look at that - the Stig,
four-wheel drifting for Japan

09:00.900 --> 09:04.140
even though he thinks
it's a fictional place.

09:06.580 --> 09:11.060
OK, the follow through.
Bang up the double clutch gearbox.

09:12.900 --> 09:15.300
Sounds like a fighter jet
through the tires!

09:15.300 --> 09:19.260
Second to last corner,
digital car and analogue animal
in perfect harmony.

09:19.260 --> 09:20.460
Gambon...

09:20.460 --> 09:22.860
Super tidy, and across the line!

09:22.860 --> 09:25.140
APPLAUSE

09:25.140 --> 09:27.060
Mm.

09:28.260 --> 09:29.980
Now...

09:31.660 --> 09:36.660
Now, I was expecting it
to be around here.

09:36.660 --> 09:38.060
The Ferrari 430,

09:38.060 --> 09:40.460
the Murcielago 1,22, 1,23.

09:40.460 --> 09:46.180
It did it, 1,19.7.

09:46.180 --> 09:48.500
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

09:49.980 --> 09:55.340
That's a £53,000
four-seater saloon car.

09:55.340 --> 09:59.780
And it's quicker than
Carrera GT, McLaren SLR...

09:59.780 --> 10:01.980
Genuinely staggering.

10:01.980 --> 10:04.580
Crikey! Small wonder that beat
the bullet train.

10:04.580 --> 10:07.380
Anyway, this week Renault
have sent us something

10:07.380 --> 10:09.140
they think we'd like to see.

10:09.140 --> 10:11.740
And here it is -
it's a mobile telephone.

10:11.740 --> 10:15.500
Now your mobile telephone may come
with something like a camera.

10:15.500 --> 10:17.100
This one comes with a car.

10:17.100 --> 10:20.100
And here it is,
it's the Megane Coupe Concept.

10:20.100 --> 10:21.900
And the amazing thing about it is,

10:21.900 --> 10:24.660
it's all operated
using this telephone.

10:24.660 --> 10:28.380
I have, for example, just opened
the 1970s doors with it.

10:28.380 --> 10:31.780
I can also switch on the headlights
like that.

10:31.780 --> 10:37.340
On the inside, I can even turn
on the funky disco lighting.

10:37.340 --> 10:40.740
You can do pretty much everything
on this car using the telephone.

10:40.740 --> 10:42.660
You can even start the engine.

10:42.660 --> 10:46.260
The only problem is they're never
gonna put it into production.

10:46.260 --> 10:48.420
I have better news from France,

10:48.420 --> 10:51.340
because this is the Peugeot 308 RCZ,

10:51.340 --> 10:53.900
and they are going to put this
into production.

10:53.900 --> 10:56.140
Well, look at it! It's fabulous.

10:56.140 --> 10:58.980
It's got the same 1.6 litre
turbo-charged engine

10:58.980 --> 11:01.940
you get in a 207 GTi
and a Mini Cooper S.

11:01.940 --> 11:05.260
But it's been tweaked
to give 218 horsepower.

11:05.260 --> 11:10.900
Up here this double bubble carbon
fibre roof also produces down force,

11:10.900 --> 11:15.020
so this car doesn't have to have
an ugly spoiler on the boot lid.

11:15.020 --> 11:16.660
Yeah. Not all brilliant though.

11:16.660 --> 11:18.500
Peugeot say it's got four seats,

11:18.500 --> 11:21.500
but I mean, come on,
even I'd struggle to get in there!

11:21.500 --> 11:24.460
You're probably better folding
them flat, which you can,

11:24.460 --> 11:25.500
and if you do that,

11:25.500 --> 11:28.500
Peugeot say there's room
in the boot for a mountain bike.

11:28.500 --> 11:32.020
Now we've heard this car will
be coming to Britain in 2010

11:32.020 --> 11:36.660
at prices starting from £20,000.
How about that?

11:36.660 --> 11:39.300
And I think actually, Hammond,
that on that basis,

11:39.300 --> 11:43.100
the Scirocco that we had in a couple
of weeks ago, possibly a bit dull?

11:43.100 --> 11:46.180
Yeah. It also means
I want to ask Peugeot a question.

11:46.180 --> 11:48.660
If you could make
this car all along,

11:48.660 --> 11:50.260
why did you waste our time

11:50.260 --> 11:53.460
with all that other
dreary rubbish, you pillocks?

11:53.460 --> 11:55.860
LAUGHTER
OK, time to do the news.

11:55.860 --> 11:57.820
And we're starting with...

11:57.820 --> 12:01.500
Well, you know Mercedes
now has the AMG division?

12:01.500 --> 12:06.020
And then the AMG division now
has the Black Ops division? Yes.

12:06.020 --> 12:09.060
They're like Skunk Works were
to Lockheed Martin.

12:09.060 --> 12:11.620
We tested the CLK Black
recently, OK?

12:11.620 --> 12:14.300
There's a new one. SL Black. Really?

12:14.300 --> 12:16.580
Trust me, you wanna see this -
look at this.

12:16.580 --> 12:19.140
Ooh! Just unbelievable.

12:19.140 --> 12:21.420
It's got six litre V12,
twin turbo...

12:21.420 --> 12:24.420
Enzo produces 650 horsepower.

12:24.420 --> 12:26.420
That's 670!

12:26.420 --> 12:31.380
1,200 torques, which they've had
to limit to 1,000.

12:31.380 --> 12:35.260
If you unleashed all of that
in a fast start, you'd spin
the planet the other way.

12:35.260 --> 12:38.100
Suddenly gravity
would be upside down.

12:38.100 --> 12:42.100
It's gonna cost £250,000. Ouch!

12:42.100 --> 12:43.420
But look at it this way.

12:43.420 --> 12:49.020
Who's gonna say, "I know what,
I'll spend £100,000 more

12:49.020 --> 12:53.460
"on a McLaren SLR Mercedes, which
is a little bit less powerful"?

12:53.460 --> 12:54.820
Good point. It is.

12:54.820 --> 12:57.220
That's Mercedes saying,
"I've got two feet -

12:57.220 --> 13:00.780
"I'll shoot myself in that one!
That's better."

13:00.780 --> 13:02.660
Right, moving on.

13:02.660 --> 13:05.660
I've got a theory. Oh God,
don't you start with theories,

13:05.660 --> 13:07.780
we have enough with his every week!
It's good.

13:07.780 --> 13:14.060
Citroen is the only manufacturer
that has a whole range of good
looking cars. Very good. What?

13:14.060 --> 13:16.740
Think about it. I am thinking
about it. The Cross Dresser.

13:16.740 --> 13:18.420
The Cross Dresser's the weak one,

13:18.420 --> 13:20.660
but apart from that
they're all good looking.

13:20.660 --> 13:22.580
Think of another one. Picasso.

13:22.580 --> 13:25.500
Ah, the Picasso - you say that,
but there's a new one.

13:25.500 --> 13:29.180
Anybody think that's not funky and
good looking? It's not bad looking.

13:29.180 --> 13:30.580
All right, C4.

13:30.580 --> 13:32.300
C4's good, C5's good, C6...

13:32.300 --> 13:34.860
Pluriel? Yes! Ha-ha!
Cock, I forgot about that.

13:34.860 --> 13:36.180
You forgot about that!

13:36.180 --> 13:38.700
It's a good point though that.

13:38.700 --> 13:43.620
Can anybody here think which
car maker doesn't make an ugly car?

13:43.620 --> 13:46.860
Across their whole range? Not an
ugly car in their range? Alfa?

13:46.860 --> 13:51.420
Alfa? No. No, 8C, Brera, 159...

13:51.420 --> 13:53.180
All good looking cars.

13:53.180 --> 13:57.300
I'm very sorry. But they've just
announced the Mito, here it is.

13:57.300 --> 13:58.660
And that is a minger!

13:58.660 --> 14:00.220
That is a minger.

14:00.220 --> 14:02.860
Has anybody else got any ideas?

14:02.860 --> 14:04.940
Aston Martin? Aston Martin?

14:04.940 --> 14:06.820
No. DB9 Convertibles.

14:06.820 --> 14:08.220
It looks like it's bent.

14:08.220 --> 14:09.260
Hummer

14:09.260 --> 14:12.740
Hummer? Who said Hummer?
Like your thinking!

14:12.740 --> 14:16.580
They're consistently ugly
across their range of one car.

14:16.580 --> 14:18.620
And they're designed by Americans

14:18.620 --> 14:21.020
who have the aesthetic ability
of giraffes.

14:21.020 --> 14:23.380
I know the answer to this.

14:23.380 --> 14:24.500
There's a surprise.

14:24.500 --> 14:26.540
Vauxhall. Eh?

14:26.540 --> 14:27.620
What, are you sure?

14:27.620 --> 14:29.220
No, he might have a point.

14:29.220 --> 14:34.020
The Vectra is going to be
replaced with the Insignia,
which is a fantastic looking car.

14:34.020 --> 14:37.060
They've got the Astra. Actually..
That's good looking.

14:37.060 --> 14:39.900
Corsa's really good looking.
Have you see the Agila?

14:39.900 --> 14:42.060
We've got a picture of it here.
Sweet!

14:42.060 --> 14:43.980
Don't say sweet!

14:43.980 --> 14:45.580
Wee little car.

14:45.580 --> 14:48.420
Vauxhall is now the only
carmaker in the world

14:48.420 --> 14:50.020
that doesn't make an ugly car.

14:50.020 --> 14:52.260
There's no real minger in the range.
No, there isn't.

14:52.260 --> 14:53.660
AUDIENCE MEMBER MUMBLES

14:53.660 --> 14:55.660
What did you say, baldy?

14:56.780 --> 14:59.580
I can't hear a word you're
saying, I'm very old. What?

14:59.580 --> 15:02.340
It's a small one they've
just brought out, the Gilo?

15:02.340 --> 15:04.540
The Agila? Gila?

15:04.540 --> 15:06.900
Were you watching the television?
LAUGHTER

15:06.900 --> 15:09.140
That! See that. My favourite...

15:09.140 --> 15:13.340
Come here. Look at that!
It's sweeeeeet!

15:13.340 --> 15:15.500
That's not the one in the showroom.

15:15.500 --> 15:17.460
You've seen one
in a Vauxhall showroom?

15:17.460 --> 15:19.180
Yeah, over at Fareham.

15:19.180 --> 15:20.260
It's ugly.

15:20.260 --> 15:22.140
It's probably old,
that's the problem.

15:22.140 --> 15:23.260
Ugh. Camera got in the way.

15:23.260 --> 15:26.100
It's unbelievable, nobody
is listening to a word we say.

15:26.100 --> 15:28.860
I was doing it in a high-pitched
squeak. That's really pretty.

15:28.860 --> 15:32.380
Anyone who buys one of those,
I'll sleep with them.

15:32.380 --> 15:34.220
Hilary Benn,
the Environment Secretary,

15:34.220 --> 15:35.860
has been on the television
this week

15:35.860 --> 15:38.780
and said he thinks the rise
in fuel cost is a good thing,

15:38.780 --> 15:42.420
because it will encourage people
to use their cars less. Brilliant(!)

15:42.420 --> 15:44.140
Thank you very much(!)

15:44.140 --> 15:46.980
Let's not worry they've closed
post offices, schools,

15:46.980 --> 15:51.420
the doctors, everything in my area,
because I can always drive
to the nearest town...

15:51.420 --> 15:52.820
No, I can't.

15:52.820 --> 15:55.580
I tell you what this is.
I tell you what this is.

15:55.580 --> 15:59.340
This is from chapter one in
left-wing dictatorship handbook.

15:59.340 --> 16:00.940
Oh, God. No, list...

16:00.940 --> 16:04.100
It is. Stalin, OK.

16:04.100 --> 16:07.540
First thing he did, limit movement.
Second thing, ID cards.

16:07.540 --> 16:09.620
Know what I'm saying?

16:09.620 --> 16:13.500
Third thing is curfews.
Rudruth this week in Cornwall -

16:13.500 --> 16:16.500
if you're not at home by 9:00pm
you're down the Lubyanka,

16:16.500 --> 16:19.900
Gordon Brown will pull
your fingernails out.

16:19.900 --> 16:24.140
We've just proved
Gordon Brown is Stalin.

16:24.140 --> 16:25.340
There he is.

16:26.980 --> 16:28.340
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

16:32.580 --> 16:34.460
Oh, good news. What?

16:34.460 --> 16:38.740
The Dacia Sandero will have
electronic brake force distribution.

16:38.740 --> 16:40.260
Great!

16:40.260 --> 16:44.420
We've all got motoring heroes, yeah?
We've all got motoring heroes. Yeah.

16:44.420 --> 16:48.180
A few of you will worship at the
altar that is Lewis Hamilton.
James Hunt.

16:48.180 --> 16:50.100
Stirling Moss. Colin Chapman.

16:50.100 --> 16:54.140
This week, Britain got
a new motoring hero.

16:54.140 --> 16:56.460
Here he is, ladies and gentlemen,

16:56.460 --> 16:59.420
Councillor Peter Greenhalgh
from Swindon Borough Council.

16:59.420 --> 17:02.700
He's in charge of transport
and what this man has said this week

17:02.700 --> 17:07.660
is that every year, Swindon Council
is giving the Government £400,000

17:07.660 --> 17:11.780
in exchange for the speed cameras
that they put up around the town.

17:11.780 --> 17:13.980
He says it's a blatant tax
on the motorist,

17:13.980 --> 17:18.140
and he is getting rid
of every speed camera in Swindon.

17:18.140 --> 17:20.140
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

17:20.140 --> 17:23.020
Standing ovation! Peter Greenhalgh!

17:23.020 --> 17:26.099
Ladies and gentlemen,
we had to honour him.

17:26.099 --> 17:28.300
We can't just let this moment pass.

17:28.300 --> 17:31.340
No. In the official register
of interest,

17:31.340 --> 17:34.100
it says he hasn't accepted
any gifts or hospitality.

17:34.100 --> 17:38.180
Well, that's gonna change right now,
because we have this for him.

17:38.180 --> 17:40.700
It is the Top Gear
Trophy of Excellence

17:40.700 --> 17:42.260
for Services to Common Sense.

17:42.260 --> 17:44.220
It is yours, Mr Greenhalgh.

17:44.220 --> 17:47.940
Services of Common Sense in the Face
of Blatant Government Stupidity.

17:47.940 --> 17:50.540
You want to pop up here
and get that.

17:50.540 --> 17:53.940
we've even provided you a chair,
the Top Gear Throne of Gratitude.

17:57.340 --> 17:58.820
It's for you. It's for you.

17:58.820 --> 18:01.540
Peter, you come here
and that is your chair.

18:01.540 --> 18:03.140
Permanently here.

18:03.140 --> 18:04.740
APPLAUSE

18:04.740 --> 18:06.420
Can I just say though,

18:06.420 --> 18:10.700
if you do live in or
are gonna drive through Swindon
over the next few weeks,

18:10.700 --> 18:13.500
they're all gonna be watching
to see if it works,

18:13.500 --> 18:14.740
so please be careful.

18:15.780 --> 18:19.300
If you do happen to have
any sort of accident in Swindon,

18:19.300 --> 18:22.980
wait until it's dark
and push the wreckage into Devizes.

18:22.980 --> 18:26.860
And then claim
that you hit a speed camera.

18:26.860 --> 18:32.060
Chrysler are about to announce
that all cars across their range
will come with Wi-Fi connectivity.

18:32.060 --> 18:34.900
Eh? You get the device in the boot,

18:34.900 --> 18:37.700
that allows you to hook up
to the internet on the move.

18:37.700 --> 18:38.780
It's very clever.

18:38.780 --> 18:42.020
What, you'd be able to check
your e-mails? Yeah.

18:42.020 --> 18:45.700
Would you be able to look at
Abi Titmuss's ladygarden?

18:45.700 --> 18:47.340
They say it's for passengers only.

18:47.340 --> 18:50.420
It really will be a case of
I went on the M40 this week

18:50.420 --> 18:52.380
and I found this.

18:52.380 --> 18:54.980
LAUGHTER

18:54.980 --> 18:56.180
You had to.

18:57.780 --> 19:01.300
Now, if you want a comfortable,
well-equipped four-seater

19:01.300 --> 19:02.820
for around £25,000,

19:02.820 --> 19:06.300
there are currently 30 different
models on the market.

19:06.300 --> 19:08.900
But these two, being old and odd,

19:08.900 --> 19:10.900
decided none of them
were good enough

19:10.900 --> 19:13.940
and instead wanted to buy cars
from the pages of history.

19:13.940 --> 19:16.420
I should stress that
what we've got coming up now

19:16.420 --> 19:19.300
isn't the usual Top Gear
cheap car challenge,

19:19.300 --> 19:21.860
because these really are
their cars.

19:21.860 --> 19:22.940
The stupid...

19:27.060 --> 19:28.700
This is what I've bought.

19:28.700 --> 19:31.740
It's a 1972 Rolls Royce Corniche
fixed head

19:31.740 --> 19:34.820
with coachwork by
HJ Mulliner Park Ward.

19:34.820 --> 19:37.980
And it's everything I look for
in a classic, luxury car.

19:37.980 --> 19:40.380
It's quiet,
it's supremely comfortable

19:40.380 --> 19:42.900
and it's quintessentially British.

19:42.900 --> 19:46.100
Frankly, if you have £25,000
to spend on classic luxury

19:46.100 --> 19:47.940
and you don't buy one of these,

19:47.940 --> 19:49.220
you're an imbecile.

19:51.940 --> 19:53.060
See what I mean.

19:53.060 --> 19:56.260
Reichsmarschall Goering has arrived.

19:56.260 --> 19:58.100
Morgen!

19:58.100 --> 20:01.900
This, James, as I'm sure you know,
is a Mercedes 600 Grosse,

20:01.900 --> 20:06.660
which was in 1963
the most expensive car in the world.

20:06.660 --> 20:08.300
Overpriced then, like most Mercedes.

20:08.300 --> 20:12.740
No! Does your car
have a hydraulically
operated sunshine roof?

20:12.740 --> 20:15.500
No. Hydraulic windows?
No. Hydraulic seats.

20:15.500 --> 20:17.900
No. Hydraulic doors?
No. Hydraulic boot lid?

20:17.900 --> 20:20.900
No. Well, there you are.
That's that then, is it?

20:20.900 --> 20:23.780
You've just got a Ford
Zephyr with a chrome nose.

20:23.780 --> 20:26.340
This is a coach built,
hand-built car.

20:26.340 --> 20:29.340
Hand-built is just another way
of saying the door will fall off.

20:29.340 --> 20:33.260
What's this called -
Rolls-Royce Mulliner Park Ward?

20:33.260 --> 20:37.140
H J Mulliner Park Ward. It just
sounds like a plumbers convention.

20:37.140 --> 20:39.100
Can I just show you something?

20:39.100 --> 20:43.060
You see these little windows,
do you know what they are for?

20:43.060 --> 20:48.460
So that when you're in the back
and the window is down, this stops
the draught messing your hair up.

20:48.460 --> 20:51.020
You've seen this as well?
Has your car got these?

20:51.020 --> 20:54.660
Curtains? Curtains.
No, they go in caravans.

20:54.660 --> 20:56.940
Are you ready for this?
Yes. OK, ready?

20:59.100 --> 21:04.740
That's brilliant, actually. I have to
concede that because what I always
found really difficult is this.

21:08.980 --> 21:12.940
Plainly, this had to be settled
and the only way Top Gear knows.

21:20.060 --> 21:25.460
What the grocer did
was cement Mercedes's reputation

21:25.460 --> 21:27.380
for engineering integrity.

21:27.380 --> 21:33.740
I think the only reason they didn't
make it out of diamonds is because
they're too weak and brittle.

21:33.740 --> 21:35.260
And then there's the ride.

21:37.340 --> 21:40.740
Just completely irons out the bumps.

21:40.740 --> 21:44.700
James will be saying
the same thing in that
Ford Zephyr of his, I know he will.

21:46.540 --> 21:50.380
Absolutely nothing is allowed to
compromise the quality of the ride.

21:51.500 --> 21:55.300
In fact, I like
to believe that if you worked
at Rolls Royce in the 1970s

21:55.300 --> 22:00.300
and you ever used
a word like handling or sporty...

22:00.300 --> 22:02.020
you'd have been fired.

22:03.100 --> 22:07.100
This was a car for heads of state,
dictators if I'm honest.

22:08.220 --> 22:13.300
People who had a 600 almost
always had access to an air force.

22:13.300 --> 22:19.220
That's why nobody carves it up.
Partly cos it's got the loudest
horn in the world and also because

22:19.220 --> 22:21.020
I can call in air strike.

22:23.420 --> 22:27.140
At the track our producers
had laid on a series of tests.

22:27.140 --> 22:30.300
The first inevitably
involved Lord Stig.

22:31.860 --> 22:33.580
OK, surprise me.

22:33.580 --> 22:36.100
As you can see,
the Stig is currently driving

22:36.100 --> 22:40.820
a 1.1 litre Hyundai iEO
down a slalom. It's an i10.

22:42.220 --> 22:44.620
Some say that's his own car.

22:44.620 --> 22:51.140
You will attempt to beat his time
in your much more elaborate and
sophisticated cars. Here he comes.

22:51.140 --> 22:54.180
It's a proud and noble car that is.

22:54.180 --> 22:58.340
With the Stig's marker laid down,
the Rolls went first.

23:01.300 --> 23:04.540
If this car had a monocle,
it would fall out now.

23:06.700 --> 23:08.180
I can't hold it, captain.

23:11.700 --> 23:13.820
It's always a dignified spectacle.

23:13.820 --> 23:15.700
HE LAUGHS

23:16.820 --> 23:17.820
Cock.

23:19.820 --> 23:20.820
He's reversing!

23:22.420 --> 23:25.620
'This was ridiculous.'

23:25.620 --> 23:28.220
Gonna be sick.

23:28.220 --> 23:33.140
OK, so the Hyundai did it
in 24.46 seconds and James...

23:33.140 --> 23:34.740
That's not good, mate.

23:36.020 --> 23:39.540
I had good reason to imagine
the greengrocer will do better.

23:41.220 --> 23:43.060
This is my secret weapon.

23:43.060 --> 23:47.020
Pull it down and it increases
the pressure in the shock absorbers

23:47.020 --> 23:49.860
to £3,000 per square inch.

23:49.860 --> 23:50.940
Cor!

23:50.940 --> 23:54.580
It is cor! It will be like
an F1 racer going down there.

23:55.820 --> 23:57.460
'It wasn't.'

23:58.540 --> 24:01.900
No, it's not quite as straight
level as I might have hoped.

24:01.900 --> 24:06.740
But unlike the Rolls
it's turning circle was less
than the width of the runway.

24:08.500 --> 24:10.900
That's quite good, actually.

24:10.900 --> 24:16.300
You've got to bear in mind
if you got a dictator in the back
and terrorists come,

24:16.300 --> 24:18.820
you've got to get away quickly.

24:20.540 --> 24:24.060
Oooh! It's a lot
faster than Captain Slow.

24:25.460 --> 24:26.660
Cock.

24:26.660 --> 24:31.300
'So with the first blood to Mercedes
it was time for our next challenge.'

24:32.380 --> 24:36.940
"There will now be a quarter mile
drag race between the two of you."

24:36.940 --> 24:41.660
But it says the only thing is you
aren't allowed to use your engines.

24:41.660 --> 24:47.700
It says, "Old cars break down
a lot and you should get used
to pushing them out of harm's way."

24:47.700 --> 24:50.140
A quarter of a mile pushing race?

24:51.820 --> 24:55.100
I've put my back out
just thinking about doing this.

24:55.100 --> 24:58.860
You're trying to get out of it.
Just say go. Are we ready?

25:01.700 --> 25:04.180
THEY GROAN

25:12.700 --> 25:15.780
I'm moving. I'm not.
And I was already ahead.

25:15.780 --> 25:18.220
I've got no tracks on these shoes.

25:19.820 --> 25:22.380
How much does yours actually weigh?

25:22.380 --> 25:25.780
2.2 tonnes. Mine's 2.8.

25:25.780 --> 25:27.940
Hang on, you're getting ahead.

25:27.940 --> 25:29.700
God, this is painful.

25:35.900 --> 25:40.860
I can't go on. I've had
a heart attack. I've won that.

25:40.860 --> 25:42.820
Yes, you have, you've won.

25:42.820 --> 25:46.660
I was still going. I don't care,
I'm not going any more.

25:46.660 --> 25:48.740
I bet I've got Ebola.

25:52.500 --> 25:55.820
Mercifully the next test
did involve our engines.

25:55.820 --> 25:59.620
Which car could achieve
the highest top speed?

25:59.620 --> 26:01.500
I've reached five.

26:01.500 --> 26:03.580
Buffeting. I've got 80.

26:07.220 --> 26:10.020
90. Good God, the trim's coming off.

26:11.020 --> 26:13.860
But with a six
and three-quarter litre V8,

26:13.860 --> 26:17.420
the final result
should be impressive.

26:17.420 --> 26:19.220
It wasn't.

26:20.500 --> 26:23.500
Children come out
of the womb faster than that!

26:27.660 --> 26:33.020
Before James had stopped
I fired up the 6.3 litre big.

26:33.020 --> 26:37.220
Top speed of this car
in 1969 was 128.

26:38.820 --> 26:41.180
120 kph.

26:41.180 --> 26:43.060
130.

26:44.100 --> 26:46.340
160. There is, 100 miles an hour.

26:47.580 --> 26:49.940
170.

26:50.940 --> 26:54.340
Sto-o-o-p!

26:54.340 --> 26:56.220
My brakes are on fire.

26:56.220 --> 26:57.820
We can see the smoke.

26:57.820 --> 27:00.420
It didn't stop and now it's on fire.

27:00.420 --> 27:03.540
It still stopped better
than me, I have to say.

27:03.540 --> 27:06.020
Yeah, your stopping
distance is rubbish.

27:07.300 --> 27:13.940
With the score at 2-1 to the
grocer, we were given the easiest
challenge in the history of Top Gear.

27:13.940 --> 27:17.180
Go to the centre of London and park.

27:19.380 --> 27:23.740
On the way we stopped
for a cup of tea and an argument
about running costs.

27:24.900 --> 27:29.340
My last service bill...

27:29.340 --> 27:31.860
There it is.

27:31.860 --> 27:34.780
£212 for a hosepipe!

27:34.780 --> 27:38.380
Yes. What was yours?

27:38.380 --> 27:40.780
Read it and weep.
That's the last service bill.

27:42.060 --> 27:43.340
Eh?!

27:43.340 --> 27:45.140
50...

27:48.020 --> 27:49.580
I misread that at first!

27:49.580 --> 27:54.460
£15,950.59.

27:57.460 --> 28:00.580
There was quite a lot
needed doing, if I'm honest.

28:00.580 --> 28:02.060
What did it do, buy you a Golf?

28:06.380 --> 28:11.620
In London our cars were plainly
so much better than anyone else's.

28:12.660 --> 28:15.980
Look at you, look at you
in the back of your Beemer.

28:15.980 --> 28:19.180
You just look like
a businessman, not a dictator.

28:19.180 --> 28:23.420
Look at him living out his
Chairman Margaret Clarkson fantasy.

28:23.420 --> 28:26.740
JAMES BLOWS HIS HORN
Don't blow your horn, James,

28:26.740 --> 28:29.620
or I'll blow mine back
and then your ears will bleed.

28:32.540 --> 28:36.460
Sure, our £25,000 cars
were a bit enormous, but then

28:36.460 --> 28:41.220
you need a lot of space when you're
talking about this level of luxury.

28:41.220 --> 28:43.460
This is my cocktail cabinet here.

28:43.460 --> 28:47.860
Air-conditioning, of course,
with mounting points
for your shot glasses.

28:49.740 --> 28:52.980
Here is an interesting
early safety feature.

28:52.980 --> 28:56.940
Window goes down. Window goes up,
but stops a couple of inches short.

28:56.940 --> 28:58.980
Then you press a little button...

28:58.980 --> 29:01.980
and it closes. That's so
you don't cut your finger off.

29:07.220 --> 29:10.180
Look at this bus.
Why does he have to do that?

29:11.380 --> 29:14.460
You wouldn't do that
to most 600 drivers, mate.

29:14.460 --> 29:16.700
You'd be in the boot
without your head.

29:18.580 --> 29:22.700
Soon, though, without executing
anyone, we were in the West End.

29:22.700 --> 29:24.980
And all we had to do was park.

29:24.980 --> 29:27.020
How hard could that be?

29:27.020 --> 29:33.100
No... Double yellow lines. Single
yellow line, double yellow line.

29:35.340 --> 29:41.300
Turned out to be a nightmare because
when we did come across a space it
always had a Smug Mobile in it.

29:43.420 --> 29:45.380
Look at them!

29:45.380 --> 29:49.260
Two gee whizzes taking up
one space, that's just selfish.

29:49.260 --> 29:52.860
In May's Britain, that would be
punishable by six months in prison.

29:52.860 --> 29:56.420
Happily though, electric
car drivers have no style.

29:56.420 --> 30:01.260
So we headed for the one place
we knew would be gee whiz.

30:01.260 --> 30:06.820
Savile Row. There's always
a parking space on Savile Row.

30:06.820 --> 30:09.540
James, that's a parking space.
I'm gonna have it.

30:09.540 --> 30:13.100
'Now we could
put this challenge to bed'.

30:13.100 --> 30:16.940
I'm good at parallel parking.
I lived in London for 18 years.

30:16.940 --> 30:19.340
How am I doing? Badly.

30:20.380 --> 30:23.820
Well, I am going to park
if it kills me. Come on!

30:26.100 --> 30:28.660
HORNS BLARE

30:31.220 --> 30:33.340
HORNS CONTINUE
No.

30:33.340 --> 30:35.780
What exactly
would you like me to do?

30:37.220 --> 30:39.220
God, this is embarrassing.

30:39.220 --> 30:42.940
RADIO 2 JINGLE PLAYS

30:42.940 --> 30:46.420
RADIO: '..And that's affecting

Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

shorter than the Mercedes big.

Right, put your card back in.

No, you've just cancelled it.

"Remove card". We haven't paid.

'Bravely, we gave up again and headed
for a traditional multi-storey'.

33:17.940 --> 33:18.940
Ah.

33:22.860 --> 33:25.580
Oh, no!

33:25.580 --> 33:27.860
I...I can't get out.

33:27.860 --> 33:30.060
'And James couldn't get in'.

33:30.060 --> 33:32.260
It doesn't fit.

everyone very cross.

CAR HORN BEEPS
Shut up!

33:37.660 --> 33:39.340
OK, fine.

You want to have a horn race?
Ready, steady...

I'm going to get raped or something.

Come on, man, turn the wheel.
Put your foot down!

34:34.659 --> 34:36.699
Hang on!

34:36.699 --> 34:39.260
Come on, pump it, James, pump it.

34:39.260 --> 34:42.219
Two miles an hour!
That's the fastest he's ever been.

34:44.020 --> 34:45.940
Anybody not doing anything?

Yes, it has.

Just admit that
mine's the superior car.

35:05.100 --> 35:07.540
It's got more petrol in it.
I would admit that.

35:15.140 --> 35:18.100
It is the colour of an afterbirth.
Afterbirth car.

35:20.340 --> 35:24.660
There is only one way
we can settle this.

35:24.660 --> 35:29.660
What I have here is a list of famous
people who, in the past, have owned
a Ford Zephyr with a chrome nose.

35:33.060 --> 35:36.340
"Ooh, you are awful,
but I like you." And James May.

35:36.340 --> 35:39.540
What do they all have in common?

35:39.540 --> 35:42.980
What you're trying to say is,
because I've got a Corniche,

35:42.980 --> 35:47.700
I must, by association, have
a wardrobe full of spangly jumpsuits.

35:47.700 --> 35:49.740
That's it, yes!

35:49.740 --> 35:54.620
Fair enough. Spangly jumpsuit man.
Let's have a look at the Big's
famous former owners.

35:54.620 --> 35:57.500
Is Max Mosley on that list? No.

35:57.500 --> 36:00.180
It's worse. It's worse.

36:09.220 --> 36:13.500
An impressive list.
It is an impressive list,
but if your theory is correct,

36:13.500 --> 36:15.820
you're either going to murder
millions of people

36:15.820 --> 36:19.900
or die on the bog trying to get 500
cheeseburgers out of your poo chute.

36:19.900 --> 36:22.180
LAUGHTER

36:23.980 --> 36:26.980
So really, it comes down
to a simple choice.

36:26.980 --> 36:28.300
Camp...

36:28.300 --> 36:30.660
Or camp commandant. Exactly!

36:30.660 --> 36:35.180
Now, it is time to put some
stars in our reasonably-priced car.

36:35.180 --> 36:40.100
My guests tonight are both judges
on the immensely popular show
Dragons' Den.

36:40.100 --> 36:44.500
My only problem
is that one of them has a name
that's very hard to pronounce.

36:44.500 --> 36:48.300
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
Theodoros Paphitis and Peter...

36:48.300 --> 36:51.340
Damn it! J-Jones...

36:51.340 --> 36:53.140
The taller one! Yeah.

36:53.140 --> 36:56.980
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

36:56.980 --> 36:59.180
How are you? Have a seat.

37:05.020 --> 37:08.460
Now, what I want to talk
about first of all is this.

37:08.460 --> 37:10.740
Since we started
having two guests a week,

37:10.740 --> 37:13.780
we thought it'd be a competition
on the sofa every week.

37:13.780 --> 37:18.260
But every week, everyone's
very polite, "No, I'm sure
you'll be faster than me."

37:18.260 --> 37:22.540
"No, I'm sure you will be".
I'm getting the impression
you two won't be like that.

37:22.540 --> 37:26.820
Absolutely not. And we've got
some questions to ask you. What?

37:26.820 --> 37:32.100
What are they? Why is it that you
can't drive fast after all the
experience you've had on that track?

37:32.100 --> 37:34.300
LAUGHTER

37:34.300 --> 37:37.620
Weak, feeble, blind,
hopeless and terrified.

37:37.620 --> 37:40.620
Shall we find out
your times later on?

37:40.620 --> 37:42.380
No. Now, please.

37:42.380 --> 37:45.220
No, later on. I've just
added ten seconds to yours.

37:45.220 --> 37:47.420
Oh! Yes!

37:47.420 --> 37:50.700
You see, they've already
started with the competition.

37:50.700 --> 37:54.260
Listen, in business,
is winning kind of everything?

37:54.260 --> 37:56.740
No, it's not everything.

37:56.740 --> 38:00.660
What else is there?
It is everything, isn't it?

38:00.660 --> 38:03.340
It is everything. He's lying.

38:03.340 --> 38:07.180
And you judge it really
on how much cash you make.

38:07.180 --> 38:09.180
It's just a scorecard.

38:09.180 --> 38:14.300
The cash is a scorecard,
a by-product, and it says
you've had a good or bad year.

38:14.300 --> 38:17.300
Yours is what?
You do stapling machines.

38:17.300 --> 38:19.780
I'm a shopkeeper. Knickers, bras...

38:19.780 --> 38:23.460
I thought you'd got rid of
the knickers. I kept a bit,
just to keep my hand in.

38:23.460 --> 38:25.460
LAUGHTER

38:25.460 --> 38:30.340
So, do you look at the
Sunday Times Rich List and look at
him and think, "He's ahead of me".

38:30.340 --> 38:33.380
Nah, cos it's rubbish.
Oh, you do. You do.

38:33.380 --> 38:35.620
Don't. You do. I don't!

38:35.620 --> 38:40.260
You do. Seriously, every Sunday,
Jeremy, when it comes out,
I get that little text.

38:40.260 --> 38:42.620
And it normally says, "BLEEP".

38:44.980 --> 38:47.100
You even compete on height.

38:47.100 --> 38:49.820
No, we don't. Theo's
given up on that one, I think.

38:49.820 --> 38:53.700
He is tall.
You mock him for his smallness.

38:53.700 --> 38:57.180
The only thing I mock him
about when we had these
beautiful cars, Maybachs,

38:57.180 --> 39:01.260
he bought a slightly
longer one than mine. And he also
blacked out his windows.

39:01.260 --> 39:05.860
That's the bit I really don't get
with Theo. Why would you buy
a car the size of a Maybach

39:05.860 --> 39:09.460
when you're four foot nothing?

39:09.460 --> 39:12.380
Nobody is ever
gonna see you looking in anyway!

39:12.380 --> 39:15.220
You've taken the idea
of tallness, which is good,

39:15.220 --> 39:17.860
and ruined it by going over the top.

39:17.860 --> 39:20.580
You have.   WOMAN: Look at his feet!

39:20.580 --> 39:22.780
Look at his socks!

39:22.780 --> 39:27.340
What possessed you to put those...?
Size 14.   No!

39:27.340 --> 39:30.660
You could go skiing
without renting any skis!

39:30.660 --> 39:33.940
LAUGHTER
There's no point being that tall.

39:33.940 --> 39:35.780
It's ridiculous.

39:35.780 --> 39:41.020
I just want to get on to this
business, because you brought it up,
of the Maybachs. There it is, look.

39:41.020 --> 39:44.060
Unwise, gentlemen,
very, very unwise.

39:44.060 --> 39:47.300
Best car ever. No, it isn't,
not even close.

39:47.300 --> 39:49.380
I had a Phantom on trial.

39:49.380 --> 39:52.220
My boat is more stable
than that Phantom.

39:52.220 --> 39:54.060
I used to have a Morris Marina.

39:54.060 --> 39:59.540
That was more stable than
the Phantom. That explains why
you've bought a Maybach. Exactly.

39:59.540 --> 40:00.660
LAUGHTER

40:00.660 --> 40:03.380
Honestly, I once drove in one
of those, sitting in the back,

40:03.380 --> 40:06.940
past some Eastern European
builders at a bus stop.

40:06.940 --> 40:10.180
It redefined for me what hate is.

40:10.180 --> 40:11.420
LAUGHTER

40:11.420 --> 40:17.860
It's just a 600 Geneva taxi with
a bit of chintz in the back.
Have you seen the colour of his?

40:17.860 --> 40:21.420
I have. I was walking
down Bond Street the other day.

40:21.420 --> 40:24.060
It's beige, mate.
No, that's Jewish Racing Gold.

40:24.060 --> 40:25.340
LAUGHTER

40:26.540 --> 40:29.540
There's one thing
I am really interested in.

40:29.540 --> 40:31.900
You've all got kids.

40:31.900 --> 40:36.780
If you make a lot of money,
you've got quite a good idea
for your kids, haven't you?

40:36.780 --> 40:39.180
Yeah, well,
I thought, what do you do?

40:39.180 --> 40:43.340
You're making a lot of money and you
want your kids to be as grounded as
possible.

40:43.340 --> 40:48.580
You know that's not really going to
happen, they are going to have the
fruits of your labour at some point.

40:48.580 --> 40:51.700
So I decided, actually,
I'll set up a trust fund.

40:51.700 --> 40:56.340
When they go to work and start
to earn money, for every amount
of money they earn in one year,

40:56.340 --> 40:58.220
the trust fund pays them double.

40:58.220 --> 41:01.940
So... So rather than getting £10
million or £1 million or £100,000,

41:01.940 --> 41:06.460
one lump sum that they can just blow
to the wind, the trust fund doubles.

41:06.460 --> 41:10.620
The other bit in the trust fund
is to encourage them to do
things that are good,

41:10.620 --> 41:16.300
become a nurse, which isn't
well-paid, all those sort of things.
Then it triples or quadruples.

41:16.300 --> 41:20.620
That's a good idea if you're
very wealthy and don't know
what to do when you die.

41:20.620 --> 41:23.940
That is very clever. Now,
I want to talk about cars, if I may.

41:23.940 --> 41:27.940
You are both big petrol heads,
despite the Maybachs.

41:27.940 --> 41:32.540
You both started out with Alphasuds.
Which we only found out today.
Really?

41:32.540 --> 41:34.740
They just told us.
I had three!

41:34.740 --> 41:39.420
You had three? And then I got wise!
I loved my Alphasud. My Alphasud
was bright orange.

41:39.420 --> 41:44.940
Every single day, I had to get
in and out of it like a lady
dismounts a horse.

41:44.940 --> 41:49.340
I had to go like that. The reason
for that is that they used to
have papier-mache sills.

41:49.340 --> 41:52.180
If I put my foot down,
I'd go through them.
LAUGHTER

41:52.180 --> 41:54.380
Anyway, the Alphasuds went.

41:54.380 --> 41:59.140
Then you did the Golf... GTi with
wonky rabbits at the back. Yes!

41:59.140 --> 42:00.900
He is a man of great taste!

42:00.900 --> 42:04.100
Have you got a
personal registration plate?

42:04.100 --> 42:06.380
Not one, no.

42:06.380 --> 42:09.180
How many personal
registration plates have you got?

42:09.180 --> 42:10.740
Quite a few.

42:10.740 --> 42:14.700
Have you got one?
I wouldn't buy one.

42:14.700 --> 42:17.100
That is so wrong,
because I bought him one.

42:17.100 --> 42:21.060
What was it? W411KER.

42:21.060 --> 42:23.460
LAUGHTER

42:23.460 --> 42:28.340
The Golf GTi, good,
and then you moved into
the sensible world of the Mercedes.

42:28.340 --> 42:31.900
No! No, I got
my first and last Porsche.

42:31.900 --> 42:37.740
944. 944? You did the Porsche.
I did the 911 SC Targa.

42:37.740 --> 42:39.980
Colour? Gold.

42:39.980 --> 42:42.980
LAUGHTER

42:42.980 --> 42:45.700
And what happened to that?
I had a bit of a problem.

42:45.700 --> 42:50.380
One of the guys I employed...
our company cars at the time
were Ford Orions.

42:50.380 --> 42:52.540
And we decided to
have a bit of a race.

42:52.540 --> 42:55.620
I didn't think it was any
competition with my nice 911.

42:55.620 --> 43:01.620
You raced your 911...
Against a Ford Orion. Mmm.

43:01.620 --> 43:03.220
You lost the race.

43:03.220 --> 43:08.300
And you think he went faster
than you round our track?
Definitely, the way I was driving.

43:08.300 --> 43:15.260
Anyway, look. It is time, gentlemen,
to see how you did out on the track.
Get off.

43:15.260 --> 43:17.900
Peter Jones, let's see your lap.

43:17.900 --> 43:20.140
Right, happy with the start?

43:20.140 --> 43:24.820
How on earth is a 6 foot 7,
17 stone lump like me

43:24.820 --> 43:28.100
going to beat
a 5ft whippet like Paphitis?

43:28.100 --> 43:31.100
Excuses, excuses.
That's good, actually.

43:31.100 --> 43:32.980
Ooh, that's very good.

43:35.660 --> 43:37.980
That's very neat
through the first corner.

43:37.980 --> 43:45.580
Like driving a hairdryer on wheels.
Don't you be rude.
That's too wide...

43:45.580 --> 43:50.100
Just. If all else fails in my
business, I've got to beat the Stig.

43:50.100 --> 43:51.700
LAUGHTER

43:51.700 --> 43:54.500
They don't make overalls
that ridiculously big.

43:54.500 --> 43:59.260
That was a bit wonky coming in
there, but nicely held
on the way out.

43:59.260 --> 44:01.660
What a place to put a cameraman!

44:01.660 --> 44:03.660
We've got millions of cameramen.

44:03.660 --> 44:05.260
Did you lift off through there?

44:05.260 --> 44:07.260
No, flat. Flat out through there.

44:07.260 --> 44:09.020
That was quick.

44:09.020 --> 44:12.020
This is the first
globally warm day we've had.

44:12.020 --> 44:16.020
That's fantastic!
Second to last corner's brilliant.

44:16.020 --> 44:19.580
Gamble... It's a wild one,
and across the line. Yeah!

44:19.580 --> 44:22.580
APPLAUSE

44:25.300 --> 44:28.540
Are we ready to see Theo's? No!
Let's have a look at Theo's.

44:28.540 --> 44:31.980
TYRES SCREECH, LAUGHTER

44:31.980 --> 44:37.140
That's called killing the wheels.
There'll be no clutch in this car
by the time we're finished.

44:37.140 --> 44:41.100
We'll see. It's a tough old bird,
this. Did you like it?

44:41.100 --> 44:44.460
No. It's better than your Maybach.

44:44.460 --> 44:46.580
Oh, brake! Brake!

44:46.580 --> 44:49.300
You can't brake there!
You'll be off in the field!

44:49.300 --> 44:51.660
Oh, gearbox, gearbox!

44:51.660 --> 44:53.580
What's the matter with the gearbox?

44:53.580 --> 44:57.260
It wouldn't go in!
Yes it would! It went in,
or that wouldn't be moving!

44:57.260 --> 45:01.780
Where are you going now? It's all
over the place. Dirty old bomber!

45:01.780 --> 45:04.380
You're the first two
we've had who haven't swore.

45:04.380 --> 45:07.700
Even the newsreaders last week
were swearing. That's very good.

45:07.700 --> 45:09.860
That's better than the tall one.

45:10.180 --> 45:11.700
Wait for it!

45:11.700 --> 45:13.420
And turn flat out.

45:14.380 --> 45:19.700
You've got to turn
sooner than that. You've missed.
Too much! Keep your foot down!

45:19.700 --> 45:22.740
Did you actually lift off?

45:22.740 --> 45:25.820
That was quite brave,
cos you got that entry all wrong.

45:25.820 --> 45:29.340
What are you doing? I can't really
see. That's looking pretty neat.

45:29.340 --> 45:32.260
Coming up to Gambon...
AUDIENCE: Oh!

45:32.260 --> 45:34.420
Lordy, Lord!

45:34.420 --> 45:37.380
APPLAUSE

45:40.700 --> 45:45.060
The Stig did actually say
he'd never met anyone
with less concept of speed than you.

45:45.060 --> 45:50.020
LAUGHTER
He said it was the first time
he's ever shouted at anybody.

45:50.020 --> 45:53.340
He was scared.
He actually wanted to get out.

45:53.340 --> 45:57.940
Yes, I noticed there was
a brownness to the back of
those normally pristine overalls.

45:57.940 --> 46:02.060
He also said you're quite heavy.
Are you really 17 stone?
17, 10, yeah.

46:02.060 --> 46:05.060
Fat bastard! I know.

46:05.060 --> 46:08.660
Right. Theo... Yes?
Where do you think you came?

46:08.660 --> 46:13.300
Er, if I got
under 1.50, I'll be happy.

46:13.300 --> 46:14.900
Smile away!

46:14.900 --> 46:18.100
1... I'm afraid I have
called you Theo Pamphlet.

46:18.100 --> 46:19.700
Cos...
LAUGHTER

46:19.700 --> 46:24.700
I've been called a lot worse. Yeah,
right. Under 1.50 is what you want.
You did it in one...

46:24.700 --> 46:28.100
forty...

46:28.100 --> 46:30.620
eight point five. Wow.

46:30.620 --> 46:32.860
And that's really not bad at all.
APPLAUSE

46:38.860 --> 46:43.420
Simon Pegg.
You're faster than Doctor Who.

46:43.420 --> 46:46.220
Now, we go on to Peter Jones.

46:46.220 --> 46:48.420
Where do you think you came?

46:48.420 --> 46:51.260
To be honest, I don't really
care as long as I beat Theo.

46:51.260 --> 46:53.060
LAUGHTER
Oh, get to the point!

46:53.060 --> 46:55.020
All right, here we go.

46:55.020 --> 46:56.780
One...

46:56.780 --> 46:59.340
forty...

46:59.340 --> 47:02.940
I can't remember... Oh! Oh!

47:02.940 --> 47:05.300
..Six point nine. Oh!

47:05.300 --> 47:07.500
Give him a round of applause,
everybody.

47:07.500 --> 47:09.820
APPLAUSE
That is a great time!

47:16.180 --> 47:24.020
The Stig, who has an
internal barometer, tells me that
Cowell came here on a cold day,

47:24.020 --> 47:30.260
when engines run better, and he said
if you were able to lose a couple
of stone, get to Cowell's weight,

47:30.260 --> 47:35.220
you would have been the fastest
we've ever had. Wow! He was that
impressed. Thought you were BEEP.

47:35.220 --> 47:37.260
LAUGHTER

47:37.260 --> 47:41.660
Anyway, ladies and gentlemen,
it's been a huge pleasure.
Theo and Peter, everybody.

47:41.660 --> 47:44.780
APPLAUSE

47:49.580 --> 47:52.340
It's time now
to talk about Green Laning.

47:52.340 --> 47:57.900
Basically, it's a countryside sport
for people who have Land Rovers,
Land Cruisers, tough stuff like that.

47:57.900 --> 48:00.020
It's not really a sport, is it?

48:00.020 --> 48:04.420
It's a collection of people with one
eye, who go into the countryside,

48:04.420 --> 48:09.500
dress up as murderers and then go
in a field and see who can get
the muddiest. No, it isn't.

48:09.500 --> 48:12.260
It's a group who see
who can do the most murdering.

48:12.260 --> 48:17.020
No! It's about man and machine
together, against nature.
Yes, you do get muddy.

48:17.020 --> 48:21.420
You get stuck in huge,
stinking pools of the stuff.
But you wade through it.

48:21.420 --> 48:25.260
You throw a winch line round a tree.
You pull the car round.

48:25.260 --> 48:31.020
It's tough, its technical
and, well, it's brilliant.
It sounds ghastly. It is.

48:31.020 --> 48:35.340
But the thing is, Green Laning is,
I don't know, like golf -
it's fairly harmless.

48:35.340 --> 48:41.180
However, there are a group of
very bitter-faced...ramblers,
who want to have it banned.

48:41.180 --> 48:46.620
They actually are calling for it
to be illegal to drive a vehicle

48:46.620 --> 48:51.900
into the countryside for the purpose
of having fun. Yeah. Seriously!

48:51.900 --> 48:51.980
This gave these two idiots
a bit of an idea.

48:51.980 --> 48:54.580
You see, hunting has already
been banned, and they were wondering
if there was a way of combining

49:00.980 --> 49:05.220
Green Laning and hunting
into a great and perfectly legal

49:05.220 --> 49:09.780
day out in the countryside for the
sort of halfwits who live there.

49:09.780 --> 49:12.380
Yeah, because you can't hunt
foxy-woxy any more,

49:12.380 --> 49:18.180
we decided to see if you can hunt
a small, Japanese off-road car.
LAUGHTER

49:22.100 --> 49:24.180
This is a countryside.

49:26.580 --> 49:29.900
And this is the Ledbury hunt.

49:32.140 --> 49:37.220
Normally when they meet these
days, they have to turn up with a
bird of prey which can kill the fox

49:37.220 --> 49:42.980
once the hounds have rooted it out,
or someone with a gun can shoot it
once they've got it cornered.

49:42.980 --> 49:49.220
But, today, they won't have to use
any of that subterfuge, because what
they'll actually be hunting is him.

49:49.220 --> 49:53.260
Yeah, as you can see,
I have everything you need
for a day's off-roading...

49:54.180 --> 49:56.860
..including a car, obviously.

49:56.860 --> 50:02.180
Its a £13,500 Daihatsu Terios -
and I know what you're thinking.

50:02.180 --> 50:05.140
It doesn't look like a fox.

50:05.140 --> 50:08.020
So, why will the hounds chase it?

50:08.020 --> 50:10.940
Ah...but look at this one!

50:14.940 --> 50:20.620
Of course, despite my best efforts,
this doesn't look like a fox either.

50:20.620 --> 50:23.780
But the hunt master says he can
at least make it smell like one.

50:23.780 --> 50:28.220
It's called red neck juice.
It's fox pee and glands.

50:29.780 --> 50:35.220
You put that on there. So, they
look at it and go, "That looks like
a car, and it sounds like a car.

50:35.220 --> 50:37.780
"Because it smells of fox pee,
I'll chase it."

50:37.780 --> 50:41.940
They hopefully won't get a chance
to look at it until they catch you.
IF they catch me.

50:42.300 --> 50:50.340
Harry... Meanwhile,
Hammond met his car.

50:50.340 --> 50:55.260
You said you could ride.
I trot around the country lanes
on a little pony!

50:55.260 --> 50:58.460
This isn't quite the same sort of
thing. It's only a pony horse.

50:58.460 --> 51:01.220
It's not. It's a hunter called Harry.

51:01.220 --> 51:04.260
The fact of the matter is,
you passed your driving test.

51:04.260 --> 51:06.580
That qualified you to drive
every car. Yes?

51:06.580 --> 51:10.220
You don't get in a Bentley
and go, "Oh, I'll never
be able to control it."

51:10.220 --> 51:12.260
So, get on it. It's different.

51:12.260 --> 51:15.380
He's a a hunter... Can you
ride a horse? Yes. Is that a horse?

51:15.380 --> 51:17.260
Technically, yes. Get on it, then.

51:17.260 --> 51:21.420
D you want me to give you a leg-up?
Yes. Thank you. I've got to have
one of these on.

51:21.420 --> 51:22.860
Right. On three...

51:24.420 --> 51:26.300
Oh, my God! Sorry.

51:26.300 --> 51:30.500
Can you do it
a bit less ferociously? Go!

51:32.060 --> 51:33.980
Thank you.

51:34.900 --> 51:38.180
I'm slightly out of balance.
Get it into there.

51:38.180 --> 51:41.940
Oh, that's brilliant.
That's how they are in the National.

51:41.940 --> 51:47.020
Why don't I adjust this horse
and we'll have a hunt,
and you'll get killed and eaten.

51:48.060 --> 51:55.180
As the rest of the hunt knocked
back a refreshing breakfast,
I scoped out the route of the chase.

51:55.180 --> 51:59.780
OK, I've got to get
from here, where I am now,
to here, on top of this hill.

51:59.780 --> 52:01.580
It's about nine miles.

52:01.580 --> 52:07.780
As far as I can see, the only real
problem is crossing this stream,
which I shall ford.

52:07.780 --> 52:14.580
Honestly,
Mr Darcy on his trusty steed -
Evostick - doesn't stand a chance.

52:14.580 --> 52:17.500
I've just noticed
something about my horse.

52:17.500 --> 52:19.220
He's had a Brazilian.

52:20.220 --> 52:22.260
The hounds were ready.

52:22.260 --> 52:28.180
The horses were ready
and, under the rules of Top Gear
small Japanese car hunting,

52:28.180 --> 52:30.780
I was given a two-minute start.

52:34.340 --> 52:35.980
Here we go!

52:35.980 --> 52:38.540
0-60 in 12 seconds.

52:38.540 --> 52:40.500
That's not fast, I admit,

52:40.500 --> 52:44.860
but it's faster than Colin Firth's
going to be able to manage

52:44.860 --> 52:46.300
on his horse.

52:46.300 --> 52:51.580
Trying to think like a wily fox,
I made straight for the nearest
wood.

52:52.740 --> 52:54.660
Come on!

52:54.660 --> 52:59.180
Proper Green Laning, off-roading
enthusiasts might knock...

52:59.180 --> 53:06.100
..but unlike their beloved
Land Rovers and Humvees, the small
and agile Terios doesn't lumber.

53:06.100 --> 53:08.740
It boings like a spring lamb.

53:08.740 --> 53:10.220
Oh!

53:10.220 --> 53:13.500
Braer Clarkson's two minutes were up.

53:18.980 --> 53:22.620
If anybody has an objection
to what we're doing here,

53:22.620 --> 53:26.180
do please feel free
to keep that objection to yourself.

53:27.940 --> 53:32.140
Keen to mask my scent,
I made for a patch of hyacinths.

53:32.980 --> 53:34.460
Ah...!

53:34.460 --> 53:41.220
You see, if I'd had a Humvee
there, I'd have just got wedged
and I'd now be in a dog's tummy.

53:46.700 --> 53:48.020
Come on!

53:49.580 --> 53:55.220
The hyacinth plan was working well.
The hounds were completely stumped.

53:56.340 --> 54:00.140
We're hunting a 6ft 5 fox,
he can't be hard to find.

54:00.140 --> 54:04.780
Actually, I couldn't even
find myself. I'd got lost.

54:06.580 --> 54:08.420
The woods.... Which woods...?

54:08.420 --> 54:11.820
Then I learned something
interesting.

54:11.820 --> 54:15.180
Fox pee is more pungent
than flowers.

54:15.180 --> 54:19.580
They're right on my track.
They are now on my track.

54:25.700 --> 54:29.460
Come on, little foxy Tereos thingy.

54:29.460 --> 54:30.500
Oops...

54:30.500 --> 54:33.580
HUNT HORN SOUNDS

54:36.940 --> 54:38.060
We're through. I'm out.

54:43.980 --> 54:47.660
All the hunters were now
chasing me at full speed.

54:47.660 --> 54:50.180
Well, when I say all...

54:52.940 --> 54:56.140
Right, what we've done
is lost the hunt.

54:57.580 --> 55:00.660
I can see tracks. There's car tracks.

55:00.660 --> 55:04.660
I'm using my tracking skills. I'm not
even using the hounds. Ow, a tree!

55:06.540 --> 55:09.260
The main pack
was now out of the woods.

55:11.460 --> 55:15.300
But, in open ground,
the Terios pulled out a big lead.

55:19.460 --> 55:21.260
I've got a bit of a tank slapper
here.

55:28.940 --> 55:32.740
Hello, people. Would you like me
to murder you? I'm an off-road
enthusiast.

55:36.060 --> 55:40.300
I was now ahead by two full miles.

55:40.300 --> 55:42.060
A gate!

55:47.500 --> 55:49.940
I've got to get out and shut it.

55:59.980 --> 56:01.900
That's not gone well.

56:01.900 --> 56:07.060
So, Jeremy had caught up with his
car, and I'd caught up with the hunt,

56:07.060 --> 56:10.500
which, worryingly, wasn't stopping
for the gate.

56:10.500 --> 56:13.060
I've never jumped.
I've never done that.

56:14.260 --> 56:18.460
Perilously close to Wales now -
perilously close.

56:18.460 --> 56:20.140
Oh, Christ!

56:20.140 --> 56:21.700
Go on!

56:21.700 --> 56:24.180
Oh, God...! I'm still on!

56:25.660 --> 56:31.980
I had 84 horse power. They had 12.

56:31.980 --> 56:36.900
But theirs were like Terminators and
so I decided to give up with the
gates as well.

56:36.900 --> 56:40.140
OK, can we jump the hedge? Let's
jump it!

56:40.900 --> 56:43.500
Or through, that will do.

56:43.500 --> 56:49.900
I think there can be no doubt,
watching this, that Top Gear
has saved the countryside.

56:49.900 --> 56:54.980
No rambler, no matter how bitter
and twisted they may be,
could possibly object to this,

56:54.980 --> 56:58.860
because the Terios is so light, it's
not even breaking the buttercups.

57:00.140 --> 57:02.620
No, no, no!

57:05.100 --> 57:06.700
Ah!

57:09.580 --> 57:12.060
Come on, Terios fox!

57:12.060 --> 57:14.460
Check it out!

57:14.460 --> 57:21.020
Plainly, reckless speed
wasn't working,
so I went back to animal cunning.

57:21.020 --> 57:23.940
Nobody can track me through water.

57:23.940 --> 57:27.540
That's a bit deeper than I thought.

57:29.980 --> 57:32.780
Oh, please don't do that.

57:40.740 --> 57:43.860
Please, come on!
I beg of you, I beg of you!

57:46.020 --> 57:52.340
We've found him again.
Why won't you work?
Why haven't I got low range?

57:54.340 --> 57:58.740
Animal cunning had let me down,
so I tried ringing for help.

57:58.740 --> 58:02.060
'Good afternoon.
AA Emergency Breakdown Services.
How can I help you?'
