00:13.420 --> 00:16.500
Tonight, we completely save
the countryside.

00:16.500 --> 00:19.660
James and I completely ruin London.

00:19.660 --> 00:22.900
And there be dragons
in the reasonably priced car.

00:29.020 --> 00:31.900
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

00:31.900 --> 00:33.580
Hello! Hello and welcome!

00:33.580 --> 00:37.140
And we start tonight
where we finished off last week,

00:37.140 --> 00:39.700
with the incredible Nissan GT-R.

00:39.700 --> 00:41.220
Really.

00:41.220 --> 00:45.700
We know that this car is faster
round the Nuerburgring

00:45.700 --> 00:48.620
than a Porsche 911 Turbo,
which costs twice as much.

00:48.620 --> 00:52.060
We know it's faster across Japan
than the bullet train.

00:52.060 --> 00:55.700
But what we don't know, cos
last week I was on the public roads

00:55.700 --> 00:58.460
and it was fitted with
an electronic speed muzzle,

00:58.460 --> 01:01.660
is what it's like when you
really put your foot down.

01:01.660 --> 01:03.620
So when the race was over,

01:03.620 --> 01:08.020
I stayed in Japan for an extra day
to see if I could find out.

01:15.940 --> 01:18.580
This is the Fuji race circuit.

01:18.580 --> 01:20.980
There's no speed limit here.

01:20.980 --> 01:22.780
No traffic either.

01:22.780 --> 01:24.620
And best of all,

01:24.620 --> 01:28.220
no need to be worried
by the Nissan speed governor.

01:30.900 --> 01:35.660
On normal roads, all Japanese cars

01:36.980 --> 01:42.660
But the GT-R satnav system knows
when it gets to a racetrack...

01:44.980 --> 01:46.820
..And simply turns the limiter off.

01:49.980 --> 01:53.220
First of all, I must apologise
for the sunglasses.

01:53.220 --> 01:56.780
This is because yesterday I picked
up a hideous eye infection.

01:56.780 --> 01:59.020
And I really don't think
you want to see it.

01:59.020 --> 02:01.220
This though I think
you do want to see.

02:01.220 --> 02:03.860
Flap your paddle gearbox
into manual.

02:03.860 --> 02:06.780
We put the gearbox itself
into race mode,

02:06.780 --> 02:08.820
the suspension into race mode,

02:08.820 --> 02:12.140
we put that button down
to engage the launch control.

02:12.140 --> 02:14.620
Left foot on the brake.
Build up the revs.

02:14.620 --> 02:16.220
Here we go!

02:19.900 --> 02:20.980
God!

02:22.860 --> 02:25.820
It's hard to say how much power
the GT-R develops,

02:25.820 --> 02:29.380
because each engine,
as I said last week, is hand built.

02:29.380 --> 02:32.220
Each one is therefore
a little bit different.

02:33.700 --> 02:36.860
But I think they put
a million horsepower in this one,

02:36.860 --> 02:42.260
because the acceleration is
just blistering. It's just savage!

02:43.020 --> 02:44.780
God! Face-ripping!

02:45.380 --> 02:48.020
With the launch control engaged,

02:48.020 --> 02:51.060
I did 0-60
in three and a half seconds.

02:51.060 --> 02:54.300
And flat out,
it's even more impressive.

02:59.940 --> 03:05.740
Partly that's down to the million
horsepower 3.8 litre twin turbo V6.

03:05.740 --> 03:08.300
And partly it's down
to the shape of the body.

03:10.580 --> 03:14.660
It looks like a discordant mess,
like Stravinsky designed it.

03:14.660 --> 03:19.060
But every crease and every angle,
even on the door mirrors,

03:19.060 --> 03:22.420
is there to channel air
to that big rear spoiler.

03:24.300 --> 03:29.420
The result is absolute stability
and a top speed of...

03:29.420 --> 03:32.020
Well, since this track
has the longest straight

03:32.020 --> 03:35.140
of any Grand Prix circuit,
let's find out.

03:38.180 --> 03:41.140
160kph there.

03:41.140 --> 03:42.660
90!

03:42.660 --> 03:44.060
220...

03:44.060 --> 03:45.140
Come on!

03:45.140 --> 03:46.260
240!

03:47.340 --> 03:50.380
Into sixth gear at 250kph.

03:50.380 --> 03:52.220
260... 275...

03:52.220 --> 03:54.900
I'm on the brakes.

03:56.260 --> 03:59.860
It will eventually do 193mph,

03:59.860 --> 04:03.380
and that's impressive for a car
that's quiet and comfortable,

04:03.380 --> 04:06.540
a car with four seats and a boot.

04:06.540 --> 04:08.420
And it's especially impressive

04:08.420 --> 04:11.660
when you think it wasn't really
built for straight line speed.

04:11.660 --> 04:15.340
Mostly it was built to mash
your mind in the corners.

04:18.620 --> 04:23.580
The axles are assembled
on hydraulic rigs that replicate
the weight of the car,

04:23.580 --> 04:25.180
so the geometry is bang on

04:25.180 --> 04:28.700
before the suspension
is bolted to the body.

04:30.580 --> 04:34.500
It uses its yaw sensor and
G-sensor to measure actual yaw rate,

04:34.500 --> 04:37.620
and can then adjust
the DampTronic shock absorbers

04:37.620 --> 04:40.660
and the four-wheel drive system
every hundredth of a second

04:40.660 --> 04:43.900
to bring the car into line
with a pre-ordained target.

04:45.700 --> 04:47.980
I don't understand any of that.

04:47.980 --> 04:50.380
But I do understand this.

04:50.380 --> 04:53.980
The GT-R can corner
so fast and so violently,

04:53.980 --> 04:57.860
each wheel has
a special knurling on the rim

04:57.860 --> 04:59.620
to stop the tyres coming off.

05:04.060 --> 05:09.140
It is extremely hard
to explain how this feels.

05:09.140 --> 05:11.380
Agony is probably the best word.

05:11.380 --> 05:16.180
The onboard readout is telling me
that in that last corner

05:16.180 --> 05:21.100
I generated one and a fifth
more sideways gravity.

05:22.380 --> 05:27.500
I wish my collar had a knurled rim -
it would stop my head coming off!

05:29.180 --> 05:32.580
When you really get going
at this kind of speed,

05:32.580 --> 05:35.020
you expect to feel detached
from the action,

05:35.020 --> 05:38.740
like you're playing a video game,
just pressing buttons.

05:38.740 --> 05:41.140
But incredibly, it feels mechanical.

05:41.140 --> 05:43.860
It feels analogue, it feels human.

05:45.740 --> 05:48.500
It feels fan-bleeding-tastic!

05:54.300 --> 05:57.500
I thought when I drove
the Mitsubishi Evo-10 the other day

05:57.500 --> 06:02.380
that there was no way the GT-R
could be worth twice as much money.

06:02.380 --> 06:06.820
I just thought there's no way
it could be twice as good.

06:06.820 --> 06:08.100
But it is.

06:08.100 --> 06:09.180
And some!

06:10.260 --> 06:12.740
They haven't built a new car here,

06:12.740 --> 06:14.740
they've build a new yardstick.

06:19.540 --> 06:21.980
Now at this point
I was going to tell you

06:21.980 --> 06:24.380
about the incredible brakes
and the turbo whistle,

06:24.380 --> 06:27.780
and how Lotus secretly developed
the spine of this car.

06:27.780 --> 06:32.220
But before I had a chance,
I had a bit of a problem.

06:33.420 --> 06:35.300
Agh!

06:38.700 --> 06:41.100
My neck's just gone.

06:53.380 --> 06:55.700
What I need is painkillers.

06:56.740 --> 06:59.220
Honestly, I hate to cause
the fuss because...

07:01.740 --> 07:03.340
APPLAUSE

07:06.700 --> 07:10.380
You hopeless old fart -
a Datsun broke your neck!

07:10.380 --> 07:11.820
It was already weakened,

07:11.820 --> 07:14.220
from endlessly craning down
to listen to you.

07:14.220 --> 07:15.860
LAUGHTER

07:15.860 --> 07:15.940
Amazing rescue service
they've got there, isn't it?

07:15.940 --> 07:18.340
I was very pleased to see that
someone had brought a lawnmower.

07:21.300 --> 07:22.580
And a bin lorry.

07:22.580 --> 07:25.140
The dustbin lorry did put
the fear of God into me.

07:25.140 --> 07:28.420
Much like I did with them actually
when I took my sunglasses off -

07:28.420 --> 07:31.140
"Oh, look at his eye,
it's disgusting!"

07:31.140 --> 07:32.580
I'll tell you the problem.

07:32.580 --> 07:38.140
You know a lot of modern cars have
those headlamps that swivel when
you turn the steering wheel? Yes.

07:38.140 --> 07:40.540
Do you know why the GT-R
doesn't have that?

07:40.540 --> 07:41.900
Save weight?

07:41.900 --> 07:45.420
No, it's because the motors in that
sort of headlamp can't keep up

07:45.420 --> 07:48.020
with the speed that thing
changes direction.

07:48.020 --> 07:51.900
Honestly, it's just unbelievable.
It corners faster than electricity.

07:51.900 --> 07:55.340
Wouldn't it be great to know how
fast it would go round our track?

07:55.340 --> 07:58.100
Yeah, problem is,
you think it's in Japan.

07:58.100 --> 08:02.740
But it isn't. We've flown it 9,000
miles so it can be here today

08:02.740 --> 08:04.860
in the hands
of our tame racing driver.

08:04.860 --> 08:08.340
Now some say that
he isn't allowed by law

08:08.340 --> 08:12.260
within a hundred yards
of Lorraine Kelly.

08:12.260 --> 08:13.780
LAUGHTER

08:13.780 --> 08:17.300
And that he's never seen
an episode of Top Gear,

08:17.300 --> 08:20.300
because he's a huge fan
of Midsomer Murders.

08:21.460 --> 08:23.980
All we know is he's called Bergerac.

08:25.220 --> 08:28.140
And he's off! Now remember,
this Â£53,000 car

08:28.140 --> 08:31.860
has monstered a 300g McLaren
round the Nuerburgring.

08:31.860 --> 08:35.500
But I doubt it will do that here,
because this is a power circuit.

08:35.500 --> 08:37.620
Very tidy through the first corner.

08:37.620 --> 08:40.860
Stig's neck, of course,
made of weapons grade titanium.

08:44.620 --> 08:48.660
And he's still all over Elton John.
Let's hope he showers afterwards.

08:48.660 --> 08:51.940
That is planted around Chicago.
A little wiggle on the way out.

08:51.940 --> 08:54.860
Hammerhead - will the big V6
upfront drag it wide?

08:54.860 --> 08:57.980
Not a chance.

08:57.980 --> 09:00.900
Look at that - the Stig,
four-wheel drifting for Japan

09:00.900 --> 09:04.140
even though he thinks
it's a fictional place.

09:06.580 --> 09:11.060
OK, the follow through.
Bang up the double clutch gearbox.

09:12.900 --> 09:15.300
Sounds like a fighter jet
through the tires!

09:15.300 --> 09:19.260
Second to last corner,
digital car and analogue animal
in perfect harmony.

09:19.260 --> 09:20.460
Gambon...

09:20.460 --> 09:22.860
Super tidy, and across the line!

09:22.860 --> 09:25.140
APPLAUSE

09:25.140 --> 09:27.060
Mm.

09:28.260 --> 09:29.980
Now...

09:31.660 --> 09:36.660
Now, I was expecting it
to be around here.

09:36.660 --> 09:38.060
The Ferrari 430,

09:38.060 --> 09:40.460
the Murcielago 1,22, 1,23.

09:40.460 --> 09:46.180
It did it, 1,19.7.

09:46.180 --> 09:48.500
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

09:49.980 --> 09:55.340
That's a Â£53,000
four-seater saloon car.

09:55.340 --> 09:59.780
And it's quicker than
Carrera GT, McLaren SLR...

09:59.780 --> 10:01.980
Genuinely staggering.

10:01.980 --> 10:04.580
Crikey! Small wonder that beat
the bullet train.

10:04.580 --> 10:07.380
Anyway, this week Renault
have sent us something

10:07.380 --> 10:09.140
they think we'd like to see.

10:09.140 --> 10:11.740
And here it is -
it's a mobile telephone.

10:11.740 --> 10:15.500
Now your mobile telephone may come
with something like a camera.

10:15.500 --> 10:17.100
This one comes with a car.

10:17.100 --> 10:20.100
And here it is,
it's the Megane Coupe Concept.

10:20.100 --> 10:21.900
And the amazing thing about it is,

10:21.900 --> 10:24.660
it's all operated
using this telephone.

10:24.660 --> 10:28.380
I have, for example, just opened
the 1970s doors with it.

10:28.380 --> 10:31.780
I can also switch on the headlights
like that.

10:31.780 --> 10:37.340
On the inside, I can even turn
on the funky disco lighting.

10:37.340 --> 10:40.740
You can do pretty much everything
on this car using the telephone.

10:40.740 --> 10:42.660
You can even start the engine.

10:42.660 --> 10:46.260
The only problem is they're never
gonna put it into production.

10:46.260 --> 10:48.420
I have better news from France,

10:48.420 --> 10:51.340
because this is the Peugeot 308 RCZ,

10:51.340 --> 10:53.900
and they are going to put this
into production.

10:53.900 --> 10:56.140
Well, look at it! It's fabulous.

10:56.140 --> 10:58.980
It's got the same 1.6 litre
turbo-charged engine

10:58.980 --> 11:01.940
you get in a 207 GTi
and a Mini Cooper S.

11:01.940 --> 11:05.260
But it's been tweaked
to give 218 horsepower.

11:05.260 --> 11:10.900
Up here this double bubble carbon
fibre roof also produces down force,

11:10.900 --> 11:15.020
so this car doesn't have to have
an ugly spoiler on the boot lid.

11:15.020 --> 11:16.660
Yeah. Not all brilliant though.

11:16.660 --> 11:18.500
Peugeot say it's got four seats,

11:18.500 --> 11:21.500
but I mean, come on,
even I'd struggle to get in there!

11:21.500 --> 11:24.460
You're probably better folding
them flat, which you can,

11:24.460 --> 11:25.500
and if you do that,

11:25.500 --> 11:28.500
Peugeot say there's room
in the boot for a mountain bike.

11:28.500 --> 11:32.020
Now we've heard this car will
be coming to Britain in 2010

11:32.020 --> 11:36.660
at prices starting from Â£20,000.
How about that?

11:36.660 --> 11:39.300
And I think actually, Hammond,
that on that basis,

11:39.300 --> 11:43.100
the Scirocco that we had in a couple
of weeks ago, possibly a bit dull?

11:43.100 --> 11:46.180
Yeah. It also means
I want to ask Peugeot a question.

11:46.180 --> 11:48.660
If you could make
this car all along,

11:48.660 --> 11:50.260
why did you waste our time

11:50.260 --> 11:53.460
with all that other
dreary rubbish, you pillocks?

11:53.460 --> 11:55.860
LAUGHTER
OK, time to do the news.

11:55.860 --> 11:57.820
And we're starting with...

11:57.820 --> 12:01.500
Well, you know Mercedes
now has the AMG division?

12:01.500 --> 12:06.020
And then the AMG division now
has the Black Ops division? Yes.

12:06.020 --> 12:09.060
They're like Skunk Works were
to Lockheed Martin.

12:09.060 --> 12:11.620
We tested the CLK Black
recently, OK?

12:11.620 --> 12:14.300
There's a new one. SL Black. Really?

12:14.300 --> 12:16.580
Trust me, you wanna see this -
look at this.

12:16.580 --> 12:19.140
Ooh! Just unbelievable.

12:19.140 --> 12:21.420
It's got six litre V12,
twin turbo...

12:21.420 --> 12:24.420
Enzo produces 650 horsepower.

12:24.420 --> 12:26.420
That's 670!

12:26.420 --> 12:31.380
1,200 torques, which they've had
to limit to 1,000.

12:31.380 --> 12:35.260
If you unleashed all of that
in a fast start, you'd spin
the planet the other way.

12:35.260 --> 12:38.100
Suddenly gravity
would be upside down.

12:38.100 --> 12:42.100
It's gonna cost Â£250,000. Ouch!

12:42.100 --> 12:43.420
But look at it this way.

12:43.420 --> 12:49.020
Who's gonna say, "I know what,
I'll spend Â£100,000 more

12:49.020 --> 12:53.460
"on a McLaren SLR Mercedes, which
is a little bit less powerful"?

12:53.460 --> 12:54.820
Good point. It is.

12:54.820 --> 12:57.220
That's Mercedes saying,
"I've got two feet -

12:57.220 --> 13:00.780
"I'll shoot myself in that one!
That's better."

13:00.780 --> 13:02.660
Right, moving on.

13:02.660 --> 13:05.660
I've got a theory. Oh God,
don't you start with theories,

13:05.660 --> 13:07.780
we have enough with his every week!
It's good.

13:07.780 --> 13:14.060
Citroen is the only manufacturer
that has a whole range of good
looking cars. Very good. What?

13:14.060 --> 13:16.740
Think about it. I am thinking
about it. The Cross Dresser.

13:16.740 --> 13:18.420
The Cross Dresser's the weak one,

13:18.420 --> 13:20.660
but apart from that
they're all good looking.

13:20.660 --> 13:22.580
Think of another one. Picasso.

13:22.580 --> 13:25.500
Ah, the Picasso - you say that,
but there's a new one.

13:25.500 --> 13:29.180
Anybody think that's not funky and
good looking? It's not bad looking.

13:29.180 --> 13:30.580
All right, C4.

13:30.580 --> 13:32.300
C4's good, C5's good, C6...

13:32.300 --> 13:34.860
Pluriel? Yes! Ha-ha!
Cock, I forgot about that.

13:34.860 --> 13:36.180
You forgot about that!

13:36.180 --> 13:38.700
It's a good point though that.

13:38.700 --> 13:43.620
Can anybody here think which
car maker doesn't make an ugly car?

13:43.620 --> 13:46.860
Across their whole range? Not an
ugly car in their range? Alfa?

13:46.860 --> 13:51.420
Alfa? No. No, 8C, Brera, 159...

13:51.420 --> 13:53.180
All good looking cars.

13:53.180 --> 13:57.300
I'm very sorry. But they've just
announced the Mito, here it is.

13:57.300 --> 13:58.660
And that is a minger!

13:58.660 --> 14:00.220
That is a minger.

14:00.220 --> 14:02.860
Has anybody else got any ideas?

14:02.860 --> 14:04.940
Aston Martin? Aston Martin?

14:04.940 --> 14:06.820
No. DB9 Convertibles.

14:06.820 --> 14:08.220
It looks like it's bent.

14:08.220 --> 14:09.260
Hummer

14:09.260 --> 14:12.740
Hummer? Who said Hummer?
Like your thinking!

14:12.740 --> 14:16.580
They're consistently ugly
across their range of one car.

14:16.580 --> 14:18.620
And they're designed by Americans

14:18.620 --> 14:21.020
who have the aesthetic ability
of giraffes.

14:21.020 --> 14:23.380
I know the answer to this.

14:23.380 --> 14:24.500
There's a surprise.

14:24.500 --> 14:26.540
Vauxhall. Eh?

14:26.540 --> 14:27.620
What, are you sure?

14:27.620 --> 14:29.220
No, he might have a point.

14:29.220 --> 14:34.020
The Vectra is going to be
replaced with the Insignia,
which is a fantastic looking car.

14:34.020 --> 14:37.060
They've got the Astra. Actually..
That's good looking.

14:37.060 --> 14:39.900
Corsa's really good looking.
Have you see the Agila?

14:39.900 --> 14:42.060
We've got a picture of it here.
Sweet!

14:42.060 --> 14:43.980
Don't say sweet!

14:43.980 --> 14:45.580
Wee little car.

14:45.580 --> 14:48.420
Vauxhall is now the only
carmaker in the world

14:48.420 --> 14:50.020
that doesn't make an ugly car.

14:50.020 --> 14:52.260
There's no real minger in the range.
No, there isn't.

14:52.260 --> 14:53.660
AUDIENCE MEMBER MUMBLES

14:53.660 --> 14:55.660
What did you say, baldy?

14:56.780 --> 14:59.580
I can't hear a word you're
saying, I'm very old. What?

14:59.580 --> 15:02.340
It's a small one they've
just brought out, the Gilo?

15:02.340 --> 15:04.540
The Agila? Gila?

15:04.540 --> 15:06.900
Were you watching the television?
LAUGHTER

15:06.900 --> 15:09.140
That! See that. My favourite...

15:09.140 --> 15:13.340
Come here. Look at that!
It's sweeeeeet!

15:13.340 --> 15:15.500
That's not the one in the showroom.

15:15.500 --> 15:17.460
You've seen one
in a Vauxhall showroom?

15:17.460 --> 15:19.180
Yeah, over at Fareham.

15:19.180 --> 15:20.260
It's ugly.

15:20.260 --> 15:22.140
It's probably old,
that's the problem.

15:22.140 --> 15:23.260
Ugh. Camera got in the way.

15:23.260 --> 15:26.100
It's unbelievable, nobody
is listening to a word we say.

15:26.100 --> 15:28.860
I was doing it in a high-pitched
squeak. That's really pretty.

15:28.860 --> 15:32.380
Anyone who buys one of those,
I'll sleep with them.

15:32.380 --> 15:34.220
Hilary Benn,
the Environment Secretary,

15:34.220 --> 15:35.860
has been on the television
this week

15:35.860 --> 15:38.780
and said he thinks the rise
in fuel cost is a good thing,

15:38.780 --> 15:42.420
because it will encourage people
to use their cars less. Brilliant(!)

15:42.420 --> 15:44.140
Thank you very much(!)

15:44.140 --> 15:46.980
Let's not worry they've closed
post offices, schools,

15:46.980 --> 15:51.420
the doctors, everything in my area,
because I can always drive
to the nearest town...

15:51.420 --> 15:52.820
No, I can't.

15:52.820 --> 15:55.580
I tell you what this is.
I tell you what this is.

15:55.580 --> 15:59.340
This is from chapter one in
left-wing dictatorship handbook.

15:59.340 --> 16:00.940
Oh, God. No, list...

16:00.940 --> 16:04.100
It is. Stalin, OK.

16:04.100 --> 16:07.540
First thing he did, limit movement.
Second thing, ID cards.

16:07.540 --> 16:09.620
Know what I'm saying?

16:09.620 --> 16:13.500
Third thing is curfews.
Rudruth this week in Cornwall -

16:13.500 --> 16:16.500
if you're not at home by 9:00pm
you're down the Lubyanka,

16:16.500 --> 16:19.900
Gordon Brown will pull
your fingernails out.

16:19.900 --> 16:24.140
We've just proved
Gordon Brown is Stalin.

16:24.140 --> 16:25.340
There he is.

16:26.980 --> 16:28.340
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE

16:32.580 --> 16:34.460
Oh, good news. What?

16:34.460 --> 16:38.740
The Dacia Sandero will have
electronic brake force distribution.

16:38.740 --> 16:40.260
Great!

16:40.260 --> 16:44.420
We've all got motoring heroes, yeah?
We've all got motoring heroes. Yeah.

16:44.420 --> 16:48.180
A few of you will worship at the
altar that is Lewis Hamilton.
James Hunt.

16:48.180 --> 16:50.100
Stirling Moss. Colin Chapman.

16:50.100 --> 16:54.140
This week, Britain got
a new motoring hero.

16:54.140 --> 16:56.460
Here he is, ladies and gentlemen,

16:56.460 --> 16:59.420
Councillor Peter Greenhalgh
from Swindon Borough Council.

16:59.420 --> 17:02.700
He's in charge of transport
and what this man has said this week

17:02.700 --> 17:07.660
is that every year, Swindon Council
is giving the Government Â£400,000

17:07.660 --> 17:11.780
in exchange for the speed cameras
that they put up around the town.

17:11.780 --> 17:13.980
He says it's a blatant tax
on the motorist,

17:13.980 --> 17:18.140
and he is getting rid
of every speed camera in Swindon.

17:18.140 --> 17:20.140
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

17:20.140 --> 17:23.020
Standing ovation! Peter Greenhalgh!

17:23.020 --> 17:26.099
Ladies and gentlemen,
we had to honour him.

17:26.099 --> 17:28.300
We can't just let this moment pass.

17:28.300 --> 17:31.340
No. In the official register
of interest,

17:31.340 --> 17:34.100
it says he hasn't accepted
any gifts or hospitality.

17:34.100 --> 17:38.180
Well, that's gonna change right now,
because we have this for him.

17:38.180 --> 17:40.700
It is the Top Gear
Trophy of Excellence

17:40.700 --> 17:42.260
for Services to Common Sense.

17:42.260 --> 17:44.220
It is yours, Mr Greenhalgh.

17:44.220 --> 17:47.940
Services of Common Sense in the Face
of Blatant Government Stupidity.

17:47.940 --> 17:50.540
You want to pop up here
and get that.

17:50.540 --> 17:53.940
we've even provided you a chair,
the Top Gear Throne of Gratitude.

17:57.340 --> 17:58.820
It's for you. It's for you.

17:58.820 --> 18:01.540
Peter, you come here
and that is your chair.

18:01.540 --> 18:03.140
Permanently here.

18:03.140 --> 18:04.740
APPLAUSE

18:04.740 --> 18:06.420
Can I just say though,

18:06.420 --> 18:10.700
if you do live in or
are gonna drive through Swindon
over the next few weeks,

18:10.700 --> 18:13.500
they're all gonna be watching
to see if it works,

18:13.500 --> 18:14.740
so please be careful.

18:15.780 --> 18:19.300
If you do happen to have
any sort of accident in Swindon,

18:19.300 --> 18:22.980
wait until it's dark
and push the wreckage into Devizes.

18:22.980 --> 18:26.860
And then claim
that you hit a speed camera.

18:26.860 --> 18:32.060
Chrysler are about to announce
that all cars across their range
will come with Wi-Fi connectivity.

18:32.060 --> 18:34.900
Eh? You get the device in the boot,

18:34.900 --> 18:37.700
that allows you to hook up
to the internet on the move.

18:37.700 --> 18:38.780
It's very clever.

18:38.780 --> 18:42.020
What, you'd be able to check
your e-mails? Yeah.

18:42.020 --> 18:45.700
Would you be able to look at
Abi Titmuss's ladygarden?

18:45.700 --> 18:47.340
They say it's for passengers only.

18:47.340 --> 18:50.420
It really will be a case of
I went on the M40 this week

18:50.420 --> 18:52.380
and I found this.

18:52.380 --> 18:54.980
LAUGHTER

18:54.980 --> 18:56.180
You had to.

18:57.780 --> 19:01.300
Now, if you want a comfortable,
well-equipped four-seater

19:01.300 --> 19:02.820
for around Â£25,000,

19:02.820 --> 19:06.300
there are currently 30 different
models on the market.

19:06.300 --> 19:08.900
But these two, being old and odd,

19:08.900 --> 19:10.900
decided none of them
were good enough

19:10.900 --> 19:13.940
and instead wanted to buy cars
from the pages of history.

19:13.940 --> 19:16.420
I should stress that
what we've got coming up now

19:16.420 --> 19:19.300
isn't the usual Top Gear
cheap car challenge,

19:19.300 --> 19:21.860
because these really are
their cars.

19:21.860 --> 19:22.940
The stupid...

19:27.060 --> 19:28.700
This is what I've bought.

19:28.700 --> 19:31.740
It's a 1972 Rolls Royce Corniche
fixed head

19:31.740 --> 19:34.820
with coachwork by
HJ Mulliner Park Ward.

19:34.820 --> 19:37.980
And it's everything I look for
in a classic, luxury car.

19:37.980 --> 19:40.380
It's quiet,
it's supremely comfortable

19:40.380 --> 19:42.900
and it's quintessentially British.

19:42.900 --> 19:46.100
Frankly, if you have Â£25,000
to spend on classic luxury

19:46.100 --> 19:47.940
and you don't buy one of these,

19:47.940 --> 19:49.220
you're an imbecile.

19:51.940 --> 19:53.060
See what I mean.

19:53.060 --> 19:56.260
Reichsmarschall Goering has arrived.

19:56.260 --> 19:58.100
Morgen!

19:58.100 --> 20:01.900
This, James, as I'm sure you know,
is a Mercedes 600 Grosse,

20:01.900 --> 20:06.660
which was in 1963
the most expensive car in the world.

20:06.660 --> 20:08.300
Overpriced then, like most Mercedes.

20:08.300 --> 20:12.740
No! Does your car
have a hydraulically
operated sunshine roof?

20:12.740 --> 20:15.500
No. Hydraulic windows?
No. Hydraulic seats.

20:15.500 --> 20:17.900
No. Hydraulic doors?
No. Hydraulic boot lid?

20:17.900 --> 20:20.900
No. Well, there you are.
That's that then, is it?

20:20.900 --> 20:23.780
You've just got a Ford
Zephyr with a chrome nose.

20:23.780 --> 20:26.340
This is a coach built,
hand-built car.

20:26.340 --> 20:29.340
Hand-built is just another way
of saying the door will fall off.

20:29.340 --> 20:33.260
What's this called -
Rolls-Royce Mulliner Park Ward?

20:33.260 --> 20:37.140
H J Mulliner Park Ward. It just
sounds like a plumbers convention.

20:37.140 --> 20:39.100
Can I just show you something?

20:39.100 --> 20:43.060
You see these little windows,
do you know what they are for?

20:43.060 --> 20:48.460
So that when you're in the back
and the window is down, this stops
the draught messing your hair up.

20:48.460 --> 20:51.020
You've seen this as well?
Has your car got these?

20:51.020 --> 20:54.660
Curtains? Curtains.
No, they go in caravans.

20:54.660 --> 20:56.940
Are you ready for this?
Yes. OK, ready?

20:59.100 --> 21:04.740
That's brilliant, actually. I have to
concede that because what I always
found really difficult is this.

21:08.980 --> 21:12.940
Plainly, this had to be settled
and the only way Top Gear knows.

21:20.060 --> 21:25.460
What the grocer did
was cement Mercedes's reputation

21:25.460 --> 21:27.380
for engineering integrity.

21:27.380 --> 21:33.740
I think the only reason they didn't
make it out of diamonds is because
they're too weak and brittle.

21:33.740 --> 21:35.260
And then there's the ride.

21:37.340 --> 21:40.740
Just completely irons out the bumps.

21:40.740 --> 21:44.700
James will be saying
the same thing in that
Ford Zephyr of his, I know he will.

21:46.540 --> 21:50.380
Absolutely nothing is allowed to
compromise the quality of the ride.

21:51.500 --> 21:55.300
In fact, I like
to believe that if you worked
at Rolls Royce in the 1970s

21:55.300 --> 22:00.300
and you ever used
a word like handling or sporty...

22:00.300 --> 22:02.020
you'd have been fired.

22:03.100 --> 22:07.100
This was a car for heads of state,
dictators if I'm honest.

22:08.220 --> 22:13.300
People who had a 600 almost
always had access to an air force.

22:13.300 --> 22:19.220
That's why nobody carves it up.
Partly cos it's got the loudest
horn in the world and also because

22:19.220 --> 22:21.020
I can call in air strike.

22:23.420 --> 22:27.140
At the track our producers
had laid on a series of tests.

22:27.140 --> 22:30.300
The first inevitably
involved Lord Stig.

22:31.860 --> 22:33.580
OK, surprise me.

22:33.580 --> 22:36.100
As you can see,
the Stig is currently driving

22:36.100 --> 22:40.820
a 1.1 litre Hyundai iEO
down a slalom. It's an i10.

22:42.220 --> 22:44.620
Some say that's his own car.

22:44.620 --> 22:51.140
You will attempt to beat his time
in your much more elaborate and
sophisticated cars. Here he comes.

22:51.140 --> 22:54.180
It's a proud and noble car that is.

22:54.180 --> 22:58.340
With the Stig's marker laid down,
the Rolls went first.

23:01.300 --> 23:04.540
If this car had a monocle,
it would fall out now.

23:06.700 --> 23:08.180
I can't hold it, captain.

23:11.700 --> 23:13.820
It's always a dignified spectacle.

23:13.820 --> 23:15.700
HE LAUGHS

23:16.820 --> 23:17.820
Cock.

23:19.820 --> 23:20.820
He's reversing!

23:22.420 --> 23:25.620
'This was ridiculous.'

23:25.620 --> 23:28.220
Gonna be sick.

23:28.220 --> 23:33.140
OK, so the Hyundai did it
in 24.46 seconds and James...

23:33.140 --> 23:34.740
That's not good, mate.

23:36.020 --> 23:39.540
I had good reason to imagine
the greengrocer will do better.

23:41.220 --> 23:43.060
This is my secret weapon.

23:43.060 --> 23:47.020
Pull it down and it increases
the pressure in the shock absorbers

23:47.020 --> 23:49.860
to Â£3,000 per square inch.

23:49.860 --> 23:50.940
Cor!

23:50.940 --> 23:54.580
It is cor! It will be like
an F1 racer going down there.

23:55.820 --> 23:57.460
'It wasn't.'

23:58.540 --> 24:01.900
No, it's not quite as straight
level as I might have hoped.

24:01.900 --> 24:06.740
But unlike the Rolls
it's turning circle was less
than the width of the runway.

24:08.500 --> 24:10.900
That's quite good, actually.

24:10.900 --> 24:16.300
You've got to bear in mind
if you got a dictator in the back
and terrorists come,

24:16.300 --> 24:18.820
you've got to get away quickly.

24:20.540 --> 24:24.060
Oooh! It's a lot
faster than Captain Slow.

24:25.460 --> 24:26.660
Cock.

24:26.660 --> 24:31.300
'So with the first blood to Mercedes
it was time for our next challenge.'

24:32.380 --> 24:36.940
"There will now be a quarter mile
drag race between the two of you."

24:36.940 --> 24:41.660
But it says the only thing is you
aren't allowed to use your engines.

24:41.660 --> 24:47.700
It says, "Old cars break down
a lot and you should get used
to pushing them out of harm's way."

24:47.700 --> 24:50.140
A quarter of a mile pushing race?

24:51.820 --> 24:55.100
I've put my back out
just thinking about doing this.

24:55.100 --> 24:58.860
You're trying to get out of it.
Just say go. Are we ready?

25:01.700 --> 25:04.180
THEY GROAN

25:12.700 --> 25:15.780
I'm moving. I'm not.
And I was already ahead.

25:15.780 --> 25:18.220
I've got no tracks on these shoes.

25:19.820 --> 25:22.380
How much does yours actually weigh?

25:22.380 --> 25:25.780
2.2 tonnes. Mine's 2.8.

25:25.780 --> 25:27.940
Hang on, you're getting ahead.

25:27.940 --> 25:29.700
God, this is painful.

25:35.900 --> 25:40.860
I can't go on. I've had
a heart attack. I've won that.

25:40.860 --> 25:42.820
Yes, you have, you've won.

25:42.820 --> 25:46.660
I was still going. I don't care,
I'm not going any more.

25:46.660 --> 25:48.740
I bet I've got Ebola.

25:52.500 --> 25:55.820
Mercifully the next test
did involve our engines.

25:55.820 --> 25:59.620
Which car could achieve
the highest top speed?

25:59.620 --> 26:01.500
I've reached five.

26:01.500 --> 26:03.580
Buffeting. I've got 80.

26:07.220 --> 26:10.020
90. Good God, the trim's coming off.

26:11.020 --> 26:13.860
But with a six
and three-quarter litre V8,

26:13.860 --> 26:17.420
the final result
should be impressive.

26:17.420 --> 26:19.220
It wasn't.

26:20.500 --> 26:23.500
Children come out
of the womb faster than that!

26:27.660 --> 26:33.020
Before James had stopped
I fired up the 6.3 litre big.

26:33.020 --> 26:37.220
Top speed of this car
in 1969 was 128.

26:38.820 --> 26:41.180
120 kph.

26:41.180 --> 26:43.060
130.

26:44.100 --> 26:46.340
160. There is, 100 miles an hour.

26:47.580 --> 26:49.940
170.

26:50.940 --> 26:54.340
Sto-o-o-p!

26:54.340 --> 26:56.220
My brakes are on fire.

26:56.220 --> 26:57.820
We can see the smoke.

26:57.820 --> 27:00.420
It didn't stop and now it's on fire.

27:00.420 --> 27:03.540
It still stopped better
than me, I have to say.

27:03.540 --> 27:06.020
Yeah, your stopping
distance is rubbish.

27:07.300 --> 27:13.940
With the score at 2-1 to the
grocer, we were given the easiest
challenge in the history of Top Gear.

27:13.940 --> 27:17.180
Go to the centre of London and park.

27:19.380 --> 27:23.740
On the way we stopped
for a cup of tea and an argument
about running costs.

27:24.900 --> 27:29.340
My last service bill...

27:29.340 --> 27:31.860
There it is.

27:31.860 --> 27:34.780
Â£212 for a hosepipe!

27:34.780 --> 27:38.380
Yes. What was yours?

27:38.380 --> 27:40.780
Read it and weep.
That's the last service bill.

27:42.060 --> 27:43.340
Eh?!

27:43.340 --> 27:45.140
50...

27:48.020 --> 27:49.580
I misread that at first!

27:49.580 --> 27:54.460
Â£15,950.59.

27:57.460 --> 28:00.580
There was quite a lot
needed doing, if I'm honest.

28:00.580 --> 28:02.060
What did it do, buy you a Golf?

28:06.380 --> 28:11.620
In London our cars were plainly
so much better than anyone else's.

28:12.660 --> 28:15.980
Look at you, look at you
in the back of your Beemer.

28:15.980 --> 28:19.180
You just look like
a businessman, not a dictator.

28:19.180 --> 28:23.420
Look at him living out his
Chairman Margaret Clarkson fantasy.

28:23.420 --> 28:26.740
JAMES BLOWS HIS HORN
Don't blow your horn, James,

28:26.740 --> 28:29.620
or I'll blow mine back
and then your ears will bleed.

28:32.540 --> 28:36.460
Sure, our Â£25,000 cars
were a bit enormous, but then

28:36.460 --> 28:41.220
you need a lot of space when you're
talking about this level of luxury.

28:41.220 --> 28:43.460
This is my cocktail cabinet here.

28:43.460 --> 28:47.860
Air-conditioning, of course,
with mounting points
for your shot glasses.

28:49.740 --> 28:52.980
Here is an interesting
early safety feature.

28:52.980 --> 28:56.940
Window goes down. Window goes up,
but stops a couple of inches short.

28:56.940 --> 28:58.980
Then you press a little button...

28:58.980 --> 29:01.980
and it closes. That's so
you don't cut your finger off.

29:07.220 --> 29:10.180
Look at this bus.
Why does he have to do that?

29:11.380 --> 29:14.460
You wouldn't do that
to most 600 drivers, mate.

29:14.460 --> 29:16.700
You'd be in the boot
without your head.

29:18.580 --> 29:22.700
Soon, though, without executing
anyone, we were in the West End.

29:22.700 --> 29:24.980
And all we had to do was park.

29:24.980 --> 29:27.020
How hard could that be?

29:27.020 --> 29:33.100
No... Double yellow lines. Single
yellow line, double yellow line.

29:35.340 --> 29:41.300
Turned out to be a nightmare because
when we did come across a space it
always had a Smug Mobile in it.

29:43.420 --> 29:45.380
Look at them!

29:45.380 --> 29:49.260
Two gee whizzes taking up
one space, that's just selfish.

29:49.260 --> 29:52.860
In May's Britain, that would be
punishable by six months in prison.

29:52.860 --> 29:56.420
Happily though, electric
car drivers have no style.

29:56.420 --> 30:01.260
So we headed for the one place
we knew would be gee whiz.

30:01.260 --> 30:06.820
Savile Row. There's always
a parking space on Savile Row.

30:06.820 --> 30:09.540
James, that's a parking space.
I'm gonna have it.

30:09.540 --> 30:13.100
'Now we could
put this challenge to bed'.

30:13.100 --> 30:16.940
I'm good at parallel parking.
I lived in London for 18 years.

30:16.940 --> 30:19.340
How am I doing? Badly.

30:20.380 --> 30:23.820
Well, I am going to park
if it kills me. Come on!

30:26.100 --> 30:28.660
HORNS BLARE

30:31.220 --> 30:33.340
HORNS CONTINUE
No.

30:33.340 --> 30:35.780
What exactly
would you like me to do?

30:37.220 --> 30:39.220
God, this is embarrassing.

30:39.220 --> 30:42.940
RADIO 2 JINGLE PLAYS

30:42.940 --> 30:46.420
RADIO: '..And that's affecting

Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

shorter than the Mercedes big.

31:50.900 --> 31:53.540
That's where you put

Right, put your card back in.

No, you've just cancelled it.

"Remove card". We haven't paid.

'Bravely, we gave up again and headed
for a traditional multi-storey'.

I am in, I'm parked.

33:17.940 --> 33:18.940
Ah.

33:22.860 --> 33:25.580
Oh, no!

33:25.580 --> 33:27.860
I...I can't get out.

33:27.860 --> 33:30.060
'And James couldn't get in'.

33:30.060 --> 33:32.260
It doesn't fit.

33:32.260 --> 33:34.580

everyone very cross.

CAR HORN BEEPS
Shut up!

33:37.660 --> 33:39.340
OK, fine.

You want to have a horn race?
Ready, steady...

I'm going to get raped or something.

Come on, man, turn the wheel.
Put your foot down!

34:34.659 --> 34:36.699
Hang on!

34:36.699 --> 34:39.260
Come on, pump it, James, pump it.

34:39.260 --> 34:42.219
Two miles an hour!
That's the fastest he's ever been.

34:44.020 --> 34:45.940
Anybody not doing anything?

Yes, it has.

Just admit that
mine's the superior car.

35:05.100 --> 35:07.540
It's got more petrol in it.
I would admit that.

35:15.140 --> 35:18.100
It is the colour of an afterbirth.
Afterbirth car.

35:20.340 --> 35:24.660
There is only one way
we can settle this.

35:24.660 --> 35:29.660
What I have here is a list of famous
people who, in the past, have owned
a Ford Zephyr with a chrome nose.

35:33.060 --> 35:36.340
"Ooh, you are awful,
but I like you." And James May.

35:36.340 --> 35:39.540
What do they all have in common?

35:39.540 --> 35:42.980
What you're trying to say is,
because I've got a Corniche,

35:42.980 --> 35:47.700
I must, by association, have
a wardrobe full of spangly jumpsuits.

35:47.700 --> 35:49.740
That's it, yes!

35:49.740 --> 35:54.620
Fair enough. Spangly jumpsuit man.
Let's have a look at the Big's
famous former owners.

35:54.620 --> 35:57.500
Is Max Mosley on that list? No.

35:57.500 --> 36:00.180
It's worse. It's worse.

36:09.220 --> 36:13.500
An impressive list.
It is an impressive list,
but if your theory is correct,

36:13.500 --> 36:15.820
you're either going to murder
millions of people

36:15.820 --> 36:19.900
or die on the bog trying to get 500
cheeseburgers out of your poo chute.

36:19.900 --> 36:22.180
LAUGHTER

36:23.980 --> 36:26.980
So really, it comes down
to a simple choice.

36:26.980 --> 36:28.300
Camp...

36:28.300 --> 36:30.660
Or camp commandant. Exactly!

36:30.660 --> 36:35.180
Now, it is time to put some
stars in our reasonably-priced car.

36:35.180 --> 36:40.100
My guests tonight are both judges
on the immensely popular show
Dragons' Den.

36:40.100 --> 36:44.500
My only problem
is that one of them has a name
that's very hard to pronounce.

36:44.500 --> 36:48.300
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
Theodoros Paphitis and Peter...

36:48.300 --> 36:51.340
Damn it! J-Jones...

36:51.340 --> 36:53.140
The taller one! Yeah.

36:53.140 --> 36:56.980
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

36:56.980 --> 36:59.180
How are you? Have a seat.

37:05.020 --> 37:08.460
Now, what I want to talk
about first of all is this.

37:08.460 --> 37:10.740
Since we started
having two guests a week,

37:10.740 --> 37:13.780
we thought it'd be a competition
on the sofa every week.

37:13.780 --> 37:18.260
But every week, everyone's
very polite, "No, I'm sure
you'll be faster than me."

37:18.260 --> 37:22.540
"No, I'm sure you will be".
I'm getting the impression
you two won't be like that.

37:22.540 --> 37:26.820
Absolutely not. And we've got
some questions to ask you. What?

37:26.820 --> 37:32.100
What are they? Why is it that you
can't drive fast after all the
experience you've had on that track?

37:32.100 --> 37:34.300
LAUGHTER

37:34.300 --> 37:37.620
Weak, feeble, blind,
hopeless and terrified.

37:37.620 --> 37:40.620
Shall we find out
your times later on?

37:40.620 --> 37:42.380
No. Now, please.

37:42.380 --> 37:45.220
No, later on. I've just
added ten seconds to yours.

37:45.220 --> 37:47.420
Oh! Yes!

37:47.420 --> 37:50.700
You see, they've already
started with the competition.

37:50.700 --> 37:54.260
Listen, in business,
is winning kind of everything?

37:54.260 --> 37:56.740
No, it's not everything.

37:56.740 --> 38:00.660
What else is there?
It is everything, isn't it?

38:00.660 --> 38:03.340
It is everything. He's lying.

38:03.340 --> 38:07.180
And you judge it really
on how much cash you make.

38:07.180 --> 38:09.180
It's just a scorecard.

38:09.180 --> 38:14.300
The cash is a scorecard,
a by-product, and it says
you've had a good or bad year.

38:14.300 --> 38:17.300
Yours is what?
You do stapling machines.

38:17.300 --> 38:19.780
I'm a shopkeeper. Knickers, bras...

38:19.780 --> 38:23.460
I thought you'd got rid of
the knickers. I kept a bit,
just to keep my hand in.

38:23.460 --> 38:25.460
LAUGHTER

38:25.460 --> 38:30.340
So, do you look at the
Sunday Times Rich List and look at
him and think, "He's ahead of me".

38:30.340 --> 38:33.380
Nah, cos it's rubbish.
Oh, you do. You do.

38:33.380 --> 38:35.620
Don't. You do. I don't!

38:35.620 --> 38:40.260
You do. Seriously, every Sunday,
Jeremy, when it comes out,
I get that little text.

38:40.260 --> 38:42.620
And it normally says, "BLEEP".

38:44.980 --> 38:47.100
You even compete on height.

38:47.100 --> 38:49.820
No, we don't. Theo's
given up on that one, I think.

38:49.820 --> 38:53.700
He is tall.
You mock him for his smallness.

38:53.700 --> 38:57.180
The only thing I mock him
about when we had these
beautiful cars, Maybachs,

38:57.180 --> 39:01.260
he bought a slightly
longer one than mine. And he also
blacked out his windows.

39:01.260 --> 39:05.860
That's the bit I really don't get
with Theo. Why would you buy
a car the size of a Maybach

39:05.860 --> 39:09.460
when you're four foot nothing?

39:09.460 --> 39:12.380
Nobody is ever
gonna see you looking in anyway!

39:12.380 --> 39:15.220
You've taken the idea
of tallness, which is good,

39:15.220 --> 39:17.860
and ruined it by going over the top.

39:17.860 --> 39:20.580
You have.   WOMAN: Look at his feet!

39:20.580 --> 39:22.780
Look at his socks!

39:22.780 --> 39:27.340
What possessed you to put those...?
Size 14.   No!

39:27.340 --> 39:30.660
You could go skiing
without renting any skis!

39:30.660 --> 39:33.940
LAUGHTER
There's no point being that tall.

39:33.940 --> 39:35.780
It's ridiculous.

39:35.780 --> 39:41.020
I just want to get on to this
business, because you brought it up,
of the Maybachs. There it is, look.

39:41.020 --> 39:44.060
Unwise, gentlemen,
very, very unwise.

39:44.060 --> 39:47.300
Best car ever. No, it isn't,
not even close.

39:47.300 --> 39:49.380
I had a Phantom on trial.

39:49.380 --> 39:52.220
My boat is more stable
than that Phantom.

39:52.220 --> 39:54.060
I used to have a Morris Marina.

39:54.060 --> 39:59.540
That was more stable than
the Phantom. That explains why
you've bought a Maybach. Exactly.

39:59.540 --> 40:00.660
LAUGHTER

40:00.660 --> 40:03.380
Honestly, I once drove in one
of those, sitting in the back,

40:03.380 --> 40:06.940
past some Eastern European
builders at a bus stop.

40:06.940 --> 40:10.180
It redefined for me what hate is.

40:10.180 --> 40:11.420
LAUGHTER

40:11.420 --> 40:17.860
It's just a 600 Geneva taxi with
a bit of chintz in the back.
Have you seen the colour of his?

40:17.860 --> 40:21.420
I have. I was walking
down Bond Street the other day.

40:21.420 --> 40:24.060
It's beige, mate.
No, that's Jewish Racing Gold.

40:24.060 --> 40:25.340
LAUGHTER

40:26.540 --> 40:29.540
There's one thing
I am really interested in.

40:29.540 --> 40:31.900
You've all got kids.

40:31.900 --> 40:36.780
If you make a lot of money,
you've got quite a good idea
for your kids, haven't you?

40:36.780 --> 40:39.180
Yeah, well,
I thought, what do you do?

40:39.180 --> 40:43.340
You're making a lot of money and you
want your kids to be as grounded as
possible.

40:43.340 --> 40:48.580
You know that's not really going to
happen, they are going to have the
fruits of your labour at some point.

40:48.580 --> 40:51.700
So I decided, actually,
I'll set up a trust fund.

40:51.700 --> 40:56.340
When they go to work and start
to earn money, for every amount
of money they earn in one year,

40:56.340 --> 40:58.220
the trust fund pays them double.

40:58.220 --> 41:01.940
So... So rather than getting Â£10
million or Â£1 million or Â£100,000,

41:01.940 --> 41:06.460
one lump sum that they can just blow
to the wind, the trust fund doubles.

41:06.460 --> 41:10.620
The other bit in the trust fund
is to encourage them to do
things that are good,

41:10.620 --> 41:16.300
become a nurse, which isn't
well-paid, all those sort of things.
Then it triples or quadruples.

41:16.300 --> 41:20.620
That's a good idea if you're
very wealthy and don't know
what to do when you die.

41:20.620 --> 41:23.940
That is very clever. Now,
I want to talk about cars, if I may.

41:23.940 --> 41:27.940
You are both big petrol heads,
despite the Maybachs.

41:27.940 --> 41:32.540
You both started out with Alphasuds.
Which we only found out today.
Really?

41:32.540 --> 41:34.740
They just told us.
I had three!

41:34.740 --> 41:39.420
You had three? And then I got wise!
I loved my Alphasud. My Alphasud
was bright orange.

41:39.420 --> 41:44.940
Every single day, I had to get
in and out of it like a lady
dismounts a horse.

41:44.940 --> 41:49.340
I had to go like that. The reason
for that is that they used to
have papier-mache sills.

41:49.340 --> 41:52.180
If I put my foot down,
I'd go through them.
LAUGHTER

41:52.180 --> 41:54.380
Anyway, the Alphasuds went.

41:54.380 --> 41:59.140
Then you did the Golf... GTi with
wonky rabbits at the back. Yes!

41:59.140 --> 42:00.900
He is a man of great taste!

42:00.900 --> 42:04.100
Have you got a
personal registration plate?

42:04.100 --> 42:06.380
Not one, no.

42:06.380 --> 42:09.180
How many personal
registration plates have you got?

42:09.180 --> 42:10.740
Quite a few.

42:10.740 --> 42:14.700
Have you got one?
I wouldn't buy one.

42:14.700 --> 42:17.100
That is so wrong,
because I bought him one.

42:17.100 --> 42:21.060
What was it? W411KER.

42:21.060 --> 42:23.460
LAUGHTER

42:23.460 --> 42:28.340
The Golf GTi, good,
and then you moved into
the sensible world of the Mercedes.

42:28.340 --> 42:31.900
No! No, I got
my first and last Porsche.

42:31.900 --> 42:37.740
944. 944? You did the Porsche.
I did the 911 SC Targa.

42:37.740 --> 42:39.980
Colour? Gold.

42:39.980 --> 42:42.980
LAUGHTER

42:42.980 --> 42:45.700
And what happened to that?
I had a bit of a problem.

42:45.700 --> 42:50.380
One of the guys I employed...
our company cars at the time
were Ford Orions.

42:50.380 --> 42:52.540
And we decided to
have a bit of a race.

42:52.540 --> 42:55.620
I didn't think it was any
competition with my nice 911.

42:55.620 --> 43:01.620
You raced your 911...
Against a Ford Orion. Mmm.

43:01.620 --> 43:03.220
You lost the race.

43:03.220 --> 43:08.300
And you think he went faster
than you round our track?
Definitely, the way I was driving.

43:08.300 --> 43:15.260
Anyway, look. It is time, gentlemen,
to see how you did out on the track.
Get off.

43:15.260 --> 43:17.900
Peter Jones, let's see your lap.

43:17.900 --> 43:20.140
Right, happy with the start?

43:20.140 --> 43:24.820
How on earth is a 6 foot 7,
17 stone lump like me

43:24.820 --> 43:28.100
going to beat
a 5ft whippet like Paphitis?

43:28.100 --> 43:31.100
Excuses, excuses.
That's good, actually.

43:31.100 --> 43:32.980
Ooh, that's very good.

43:35.660 --> 43:37.980
That's very neat
through the first corner.

43:37.980 --> 43:45.580
Like driving a hairdryer on wheels.
Don't you be rude.
That's too wide...

43:45.580 --> 43:50.100
Just. If all else fails in my
business, I've got to beat the Stig.

43:50.100 --> 43:51.700
LAUGHTER

43:51.700 --> 43:54.500
They don't make overalls
that ridiculously big.

43:54.500 --> 43:59.260
That was a bit wonky coming in
there, but nicely held
on the way out.

43:59.260 --> 44:01.660
What a place to put a cameraman!

44:01.660 --> 44:03.660
We've got millions of cameramen.

44:03.660 --> 44:05.260
Did you lift off through there?

44:05.260 --> 44:07.260
No, flat. Flat out through there.

44:07.260 --> 44:09.020
That was quick.

44:09.020 --> 44:12.020
This is the first
globally warm day we've had.

44:12.020 --> 44:16.020
That's fantastic!
Second to last corner's brilliant.

44:16.020 --> 44:19.580
Gamble... It's a wild one,
and across the line. Yeah!

44:19.580 --> 44:22.580
APPLAUSE

44:25.300 --> 44:28.540
Are we ready to see Theo's? No!
Let's have a look at Theo's.

44:28.540 --> 44:31.980
TYRES SCREECH, LAUGHTER

44:31.980 --> 44:37.140
That's called killing the wheels.
There'll be no clutch in this car
by the time we're finished.

44:37.140 --> 44:41.100
We'll see. It's a tough old bird,
this. Did you like it?

44:41.100 --> 44:44.460
No. It's better than your Maybach.

44:44.460 --> 44:46.580
Oh, brake! Brake!

44:46.580 --> 44:49.300
You can't brake there!
You'll be off in the field!

44:49.300 --> 44:51.660
Oh, gearbox, gearbox!

44:51.660 --> 44:53.580
What's the matter with the gearbox?

44:53.580 --> 44:57.260
It wouldn't go in!
Yes it would! It went in,
or that wouldn't be moving!

44:57.260 --> 45:01.780
Where are you going now? It's all
over the place. Dirty old bomber!

45:01.780 --> 45:04.380
You're the first two
we've had who haven't swore.

45:04.380 --> 45:07.700
Even the newsreaders last week
were swearing. That's very good.

45:07.700 --> 45:09.860
That's better than the tall one.

45:10.180 --> 45:11.700
Wait for it!

45:11.700 --> 45:13.420
And turn flat out.

45:14.380 --> 45:19.700
You've got to turn
sooner than that. You've missed.
Too much! Keep your foot down!

45:19.700 --> 45:22.740
Did you actually lift off?

45:22.740 --> 45:25.820
That was quite brave,
cos you got that entry all wrong.

45:25.820 --> 45:29.340
What are you doing? I can't really
see. That's looking pretty neat.

45:29.340 --> 45:32.260
Coming up to Gambon...
AUDIENCE: Oh!

45:32.260 --> 45:34.420
Lordy, Lord!

45:34.420 --> 45:37.380
APPLAUSE

45:40.700 --> 45:45.060
The Stig did actually say
he'd never met anyone
with less concept of speed than you.

45:45.060 --> 45:50.020
LAUGHTER
He said it was the first time
he's ever shouted at anybody.

45:50.020 --> 45:53.340
He was scared.
He actually wanted to get out.

45:53.340 --> 45:57.940
Yes, I noticed there was
a brownness to the back of
those normally pristine overalls.

45:57.940 --> 46:02.060
He also said you're quite heavy.
Are you really 17 stone?
17, 10, yeah.

46:02.060 --> 46:05.060
Fat bastard! I know.

46:05.060 --> 46:08.660
Right. Theo... Yes?
Where do you think you came?

46:08.660 --> 46:13.300
Er, if I got
under 1.50, I'll be happy.

46:13.300 --> 46:14.900
Smile away!

46:14.900 --> 46:18.100
1... I'm afraid I have
called you Theo Pamphlet.

46:18.100 --> 46:19.700
Cos...
LAUGHTER

46:19.700 --> 46:24.700
I've been called a lot worse. Yeah,
right. Under 1.50 is what you want.
You did it in one...

46:24.700 --> 46:28.100
forty...

46:28.100 --> 46:30.620
eight point five. Wow.

46:30.620 --> 46:32.860
And that's really not bad at all.
APPLAUSE

46:38.860 --> 46:43.420
Simon Pegg.
You're faster than Doctor Who.

46:43.420 --> 46:46.220
Now, we go on to Peter Jones.

46:46.220 --> 46:48.420
Where do you think you came?

46:48.420 --> 46:51.260
To be honest, I don't really
care as long as I beat Theo.

46:51.260 --> 46:53.060
LAUGHTER
Oh, get to the point!

46:53.060 --> 46:55.020
All right, here we go.

46:55.020 --> 46:56.780
One...

46:56.780 --> 46:59.340
forty...

46:59.340 --> 47:02.940
I can't remember... Oh! Oh!

47:02.940 --> 47:05.300
..Six point nine. Oh!

47:05.300 --> 47:07.500
Give him a round of applause,
everybody.

47:07.500 --> 47:09.820
APPLAUSE
That is a great time!

47:16.180 --> 47:24.020
The Stig, who has an
internal barometer, tells me that
Cowell came here on a cold day,

47:24.020 --> 47:30.260
when engines run better, and he said
if you were able to lose a couple
of stone, get to Cowell's weight,

47:30.260 --> 47:35.220
you would have been the fastest
we've ever had. Wow! He was that
impressed. Thought you were BEEP.

47:35.220 --> 47:37.260
LAUGHTER

47:37.260 --> 47:41.660
Anyway, ladies and gentlemen,
it's been a huge pleasure.
Theo and Peter, everybody.

47:41.660 --> 47:44.780
APPLAUSE

47:49.580 --> 47:52.340
It's time now
to talk about Green Laning.

47:52.340 --> 47:57.900
Basically, it's a countryside sport
for people who have Land Rovers,
Land Cruisers, tough stuff like that.

47:57.900 --> 48:00.020
It's not really a sport, is it?

48:00.020 --> 48:04.420
It's a collection of people with one
eye, who go into the countryside,

48:04.420 --> 48:09.500
dress up as murderers and then go
in a field and see who can get
the muddiest. No, it isn't.

48:09.500 --> 48:12.260
It's a group who see
who can do the most murdering.

48:12.260 --> 48:17.020
No! It's about man and machine
together, against nature.
Yes, you do get muddy.

48:17.020 --> 48:21.420
You get stuck in huge,
stinking pools of the stuff.
But you wade through it.

48:21.420 --> 48:25.260
You throw a winch line round a tree.
You pull the car round.

48:25.260 --> 48:31.020
It's tough, its technical
and, well, it's brilliant.
It sounds ghastly. It is.

48:31.020 --> 48:35.340
But the thing is, Green Laning is,
I don't know, like golf -
it's fairly harmless.

48:35.340 --> 48:41.180
However, there are a group of
very bitter-faced...ramblers,
who want to have it banned.

48:41.180 --> 48:46.620
They actually are calling for it
to be illegal to drive a vehicle

48:46.620 --> 48:51.900
into the countryside for the purpose
of having fun. Yeah. Seriously!

48:51.900 --> 48:51.980
This gave these two idiots
a bit of an idea.

48:51.980 --> 48:54.580
You see, hunting has already
been banned, and they were wondering
if there was a way of combining

49:00.980 --> 49:05.220
Green Laning and hunting
into a great and perfectly legal

49:05.220 --> 49:09.780
day out in the countryside for the
sort of halfwits who live there.

49:09.780 --> 49:12.380
Yeah, because you can't hunt
foxy-woxy any more,

49:12.380 --> 49:18.180
we decided to see if you can hunt
a small, Japanese off-road car.
LAUGHTER

49:22.100 --> 49:24.180
This is a countryside.

49:26.580 --> 49:29.900
And this is the Ledbury hunt.

49:32.140 --> 49:37.220
Normally when they meet these
days, they have to turn up with a
bird of prey which can kill the fox

49:37.220 --> 49:42.980
once the hounds have rooted it out,
or someone with a gun can shoot it
once they've got it cornered.

49:42.980 --> 49:49.220
But, today, they won't have to use
any of that subterfuge, because what
they'll actually be hunting is him.

49:49.220 --> 49:53.260
Yeah, as you can see,
I have everything you need
for a day's off-roading...

49:54.180 --> 49:56.860
..including a car, obviously.

49:56.860 --> 50:02.180
Its a Â£13,500 Daihatsu Terios -
and I know what you're thinking.

50:02.180 --> 50:05.140
It doesn't look like a fox.

50:05.140 --> 50:08.020
So, why will the hounds chase it?

50:08.020 --> 50:10.940
Ah...but look at this one!

50:14.940 --> 50:20.620
Of course, despite my best efforts,
this doesn't look like a fox either.

50:20.620 --> 50:23.780
But the hunt master says he can
at least make it smell like one.

50:23.780 --> 50:28.220
It's called red neck juice.
It's fox pee and glands.

50:29.780 --> 50:35.220
You put that on there. So, they
look at it and go, "That looks like
a car, and it sounds like a car.

50:35.220 --> 50:37.780
"Because it smells of fox pee,
I'll chase it."

50:37.780 --> 50:41.940
They hopefully won't get a chance
to look at it until they catch you.
IF they catch me.

50:42.300 --> 50:50.340
Harry... Meanwhile,
Hammond met his car.

50:50.340 --> 50:55.260
You said you could ride.
I trot around the country lanes
on a little pony!

50:55.260 --> 50:58.460
This isn't quite the same sort of
thing. It's only a pony horse.

50:58.460 --> 51:01.220
It's not. It's a hunter called Harry.

51:01.220 --> 51:04.260
The fact of the matter is,
you passed your driving test.

51:04.260 --> 51:06.580
That qualified you to drive
every car. Yes?

51:06.580 --> 51:10.220
You don't get in a Bentley
and go, "Oh, I'll never
be able to control it."

51:10.220 --> 51:12.260
So, get on it. It's different.

51:12.260 --> 51:15.380
He's a a hunter... Can you
ride a horse? Yes. Is that a horse?

51:15.380 --> 51:17.260
Technically, yes. Get on it, then.

51:17.260 --> 51:21.420
D you want me to give you a leg-up?
Yes. Thank you. I've got to have
one of these on.

51:21.420 --> 51:22.860
Right. On three...

51:24.420 --> 51:26.300
Oh, my God! Sorry.

51:26.300 --> 51:30.500
Can you do it
a bit less ferociously? Go!

51:32.060 --> 51:33.980
Thank you.

51:34.900 --> 51:38.180
I'm slightly out of balance.
Get it into there.

51:38.180 --> 51:41.940
Oh, that's brilliant.
That's how they are in the National.

51:41.940 --> 51:47.020
Why don't I adjust this horse
and we'll have a hunt,
and you'll get killed and eaten.

51:48.060 --> 51:55.180
As the rest of the hunt knocked
back a refreshing breakfast,
I scoped out the route of the chase.

51:55.180 --> 51:59.780
OK, I've got to get
from here, where I am now,
to here, on top of this hill.

51:59.780 --> 52:01.580
It's about nine miles.

52:01.580 --> 52:07.780
As far as I can see, the only real
problem is crossing this stream,
which I shall ford.

52:07.780 --> 52:14.580
Honestly,
Mr Darcy on his trusty steed -
Evostick - doesn't stand a chance.

52:14.580 --> 52:17.500
I've just noticed
something about my horse.

52:17.500 --> 52:19.220
He's had a Brazilian.

52:20.220 --> 52:22.260
The hounds were ready.

52:22.260 --> 52:28.180
The horses were ready
and, under the rules of Top Gear
small Japanese car hunting,

52:28.180 --> 52:30.780
I was given a two-minute start.

52:34.340 --> 52:35.980
Here we go!

52:35.980 --> 52:38.540
0-60 in 12 seconds.

52:38.540 --> 52:40.500
That's not fast, I admit,

52:40.500 --> 52:44.860
but it's faster than Colin Firth's
going to be able to manage

52:44.860 --> 52:46.300
on his horse.

52:46.300 --> 52:51.580
Trying to think like a wily fox,
I made straight for the nearest
wood.

52:52.740 --> 52:54.660
Come on!

52:54.660 --> 52:59.180
Proper Green Laning, off-roading
enthusiasts might knock...

52:59.180 --> 53:06.100
..but unlike their beloved
Land Rovers and Humvees, the small
and agile Terios doesn't lumber.

53:06.100 --> 53:08.740
It boings like a spring lamb.

53:08.740 --> 53:10.220
Oh!

53:10.220 --> 53:13.500
Braer Clarkson's two minutes were up.

53:18.980 --> 53:22.620
If anybody has an objection
to what we're doing here,

53:22.620 --> 53:26.180
do please feel free
to keep that objection to yourself.

53:27.940 --> 53:32.140
Keen to mask my scent,
I made for a patch of hyacinths.

53:32.980 --> 53:34.460
Ah...!

53:34.460 --> 53:41.220
You see, if I'd had a Humvee
there, I'd have just got wedged
and I'd now be in a dog's tummy.

53:46.700 --> 53:48.020
Come on!

53:49.580 --> 53:55.220
The hyacinth plan was working well.
The hounds were completely stumped.

53:56.340 --> 54:00.140
We're hunting a 6ft 5 fox,
he can't be hard to find.

54:00.140 --> 54:04.780
Actually, I couldn't even
find myself. I'd got lost.

54:06.580 --> 54:08.420
The woods.... Which woods...?

54:08.420 --> 54:11.820
Then I learned something
interesting.

54:11.820 --> 54:15.180
Fox pee is more pungent
than flowers.

54:15.180 --> 54:19.580
They're right on my track.
They are now on my track.

54:25.700 --> 54:29.460
Come on, little foxy Tereos thingy.

54:29.460 --> 54:30.500
Oops...

54:30.500 --> 54:33.580
HUNT HORN SOUNDS

54:36.940 --> 54:38.060
We're through. I'm out.

54:43.980 --> 54:47.660
All the hunters were now
chasing me at full speed.

54:47.660 --> 54:50.180
Well, when I say all...

54:52.940 --> 54:56.140
Right, what we've done
is lost the hunt.

54:57.580 --> 55:00.660
I can see tracks. There's car tracks.

55:00.660 --> 55:04.660
I'm using my tracking skills. I'm not
even using the hounds. Ow, a tree!

55:06.540 --> 55:09.260
The main pack
was now out of the woods.

55:11.460 --> 55:15.300
But, in open ground,
the Terios pulled out a big lead.

55:19.460 --> 55:21.260
I've got a bit of a tank slapper
here.

55:28.940 --> 55:32.740
Hello, people. Would you like me
to murder you? I'm an off-road
enthusiast.

55:36.060 --> 55:40.300
I was now ahead by two full miles.

55:40.300 --> 55:42.060
A gate!

55:47.500 --> 55:49.940
I've got to get out and shut it.

55:59.980 --> 56:01.900
That's not gone well.

56:01.900 --> 56:07.060
So, Jeremy had caught up with his
car, and I'd caught up with the hunt,

56:07.060 --> 56:10.500
which, worryingly, wasn't stopping
for the gate.

56:10.500 --> 56:13.060
I've never jumped.
I've never done that.

56:14.260 --> 56:18.460
Perilously close to Wales now -
perilously close.

56:18.460 --> 56:20.140
Oh, Christ!

56:20.140 --> 56:21.700
Go on!

56:21.700 --> 56:24.180
Oh, God...! I'm still on!

56:25.660 --> 56:31.980
I had 84 horse power. They had 12.

56:31.980 --> 56:36.900
But theirs were like Terminators and
so I decided to give up with the
gates as well.

56:36.900 --> 56:40.140
OK, can we jump the hedge? Let's
jump it!

56:40.900 --> 56:43.500
Or through, that will do.

56:43.500 --> 56:49.900
I think there can be no doubt,
watching this, that Top Gear
has saved the countryside.

56:49.900 --> 56:54.980
No rambler, no matter how bitter
and twisted they may be,
could possibly object to this,

56:54.980 --> 56:58.860
because the Terios is so light, it's
not even breaking the buttercups.

57:00.140 --> 57:02.620
No, no, no!

57:05.100 --> 57:06.700
Ah!

57:09.580 --> 57:12.060
Come on, Terios fox!

57:12.060 --> 57:14.460
Check it out!

57:14.460 --> 57:21.020
Plainly, reckless speed
wasn't working,
so I went back to animal cunning.

57:21.020 --> 57:23.940
Nobody can track me through water.

57:23.940 --> 57:27.540
That's a bit deeper than I thought.

57:29.980 --> 57:32.780
Oh, please don't do that.

57:40.740 --> 57:43.860
Please, come on!
I beg of you, I beg of you!

57:46.020 --> 57:52.340
We've found him again.
Why won't you work?
Why haven't I got low range?

57:54.340 --> 57:58.740
Animal cunning had let me down,
so I tried ringing for help.

57:58.740 --> 58:02.060
'Good afternoon.
AA Emergency Breakdown Services.
How can I help you?'
