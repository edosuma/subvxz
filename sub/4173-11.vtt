It's tradition, Jimmy.
We don't question it.

01:46.857 --> 01:48.942
I mean, it's not even

Day Festival's opening ceremony?

What's so important
anyway?

02:04.875 --> 02:07.753
Oh, nothing. Just taking the "What
Kind of Teenager Are You?" quiz

02:07.836 --> 02:09.920
to unlock my true
teen identity.

02:10.005 --> 02:13.133
Well, I'll just leave that to the
professionals at the magazine.

02:13.175 --> 02:16.053
Oh, look at that!
An inflatable wading pool.

02:16.053 --> 02:18.764
Oh, it's just like the one I
used to play in with Candace

02:18.764 --> 02:19.806
when she was little.

02:19.806 --> 02:22.059
Remember, hon?
Mmm-hmm.

02:22.059 --> 02:24.061
Ferb, I know what
we're gonna do today.

02:24.061 --> 02:26.772
And I'll tell you
after the wipe.

03:21.451 --> 03:23.328
An Emo Teen, Stacy.

03:23.328 --> 03:25.247
I don't even know
what that is!

03:25.247 --> 03:27.124
Okay. To the Internet.

03:27.124 --> 03:28.875
Here we go. Emo, Emo.

03:28.875 --> 03:30.961
"Emos believe
everyone's against them."

03:30.961 --> 03:32.212
How can you
say that to me?

03:32.254 --> 03:34.381
"They are highly sensitive
and drama queens."

03:34.381 --> 03:36.258
No, I'm not!

03:36.258 --> 03:38.260
You know, as teenage subcultures
g0, it's not so bad.

03:38.260 --> 03:40.721
You just need a new look to
match your true teen identity.

03:40.762 --> 03:42.139
I'll be right over.

03:42.139 --> 03:44.391
PHINEAS: Ferb, how's the
pool inflation coming?

03:45.726 --> 03:48.145
Hi, Phineas.
What you doing?

03:48.145 --> 03:50.731
Ferb and I are building a
super-inflatable wading pool.

03:50.772 --> 03:54.276
I'd love to! But actually,
I need your help.

03:54.276 --> 03:56.027
Anything for you, Isabella.

03:56.111 --> 03:57.988
Really?
Of course.

03:57.988 --> 04:00.490
Your word is my
humble command.

04:00.490 --> 04:03.243
I would travel the four
corners of the globe,

04:03.243 --> 04:04.536
which I actually
have done,

04:04.536 --> 04:07.247
but this time
it would be for you!

04:07.289 --> 04:09.249
All for you!

04:09.249 --> 04:10.292
Aw.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.544
Ah-ahem.

04:12.544 --> 04:14.421
You were lost in
Phineas Land again.

04:14.421 --> 04:16.380
Oh, right. Right.

04:16.380 --> 04:18.382
The Fireside Girls are going
for our Beekeeping Patch

04:18.382 --> 04:23.263
Of course! But I'll need some
collateral if you're gonna borrow Ferb.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.515
(LAUGHS) Oh, Phineas.

04:25.515 --> 04:27.142
It's not that funny.

Hey, great costume!

04:41.156 --> 04:42.407
That's the bee's knees.

04:42.407 --> 04:45.035
Or, you know,
wings, in this case.

04:45.035 --> 04:48.288

Hey, swat's your problem?
(GRUNTS)

04:53.418 --> 04:55.295
I'm sorry.
I, I can't help it.

04:55.295 --> 04:58.131
I got bees on the brain.
Especially the queen bee.

04:58.173 --> 05:00.425
Queen bee this,
queen bee that.

05:00.425 --> 05:02.427
You never hear about
the king bee, do you?

05:02.427 --> 05:06.306
That means there's a power
vacuum that I need to exploit.

05:06.306 --> 05:09.059
Bee-hold!
The Aroma-inator!

05:10.018 --> 05:13.814
I have acquired mass
quantities of pheromones.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.315
See?
Right here in the tank.

05:15.315 --> 05:18.819
Once I spray myself, the
bees will be attracted to me

05:18.819 --> 05:21.321
and I will be crowned
king bee!

05:21.321 --> 05:23.573
After that, it's just
a hop, skip and a jump

05:23.573 --> 05:26.284
to ruling the entire
Tri-State Area!

05:26.284 --> 05:28.954
Okay, so the top three items
on the Heather Magazine

05:28.954 --> 05:30.956
Eleven-Step Guide to Being
a True Emo Teen are

05:30.956 --> 05:33.166

05:36.461 --> 05:38.964
Hey, not bad!

05:38.964 --> 05:44.970
Now there's just one last test
to see if you're a true Emo.

05:45.053 --> 05:46.221
Do you have
enough ennui

05:46.221 --> 05:48.348
to resist the urge
to bust your brothers?

05:48.348 --> 05:50.225
I don't think your mom
would approve.

05:50.225 --> 05:53.103
Of course not! They are gonna
be so bust... Ah, ah, ah!

05:53.103 --> 05:55.188
True identity, Candace.

(SIGHS)

06:05.365 --> 06:06.575
What's the point?

06:06.575 --> 06:08.493
No one understands me
anyway.

06:08.493 --> 06:10.245
<i>Wow, Heather Magazine

06:10.245 --> 06:11.621

We're sure to get our
Beekeeping Patch now!

06:13.498 --> 06:14.958
No problem.

06:14.958 --> 06:16.626
What are friends for
if not to reconfigure

06:16.626 --> 06:18.503
a sorbet machine that
turns people into flies

06:18.503 --> 06:21.089
into a sorbet machine that
turns people into bees?

06:21.089 --> 06:24.217
Just remember the effect wea rs
off after a couple of hours.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.511
Why don't you come back for our
inflatable wading pool party

06:26.511 --> 06:27.637
after your
patch ceremony?

06:27.637 --> 06:29.139
Of course!
Wouldn't miss it!

06:29.139 --> 06:30.473
This is fascinating.

06:30.473 --> 06:33.226
Tell me more about bee dancing.
Really?

06:33.226 --> 06:36.021
Because usually people are
either gone or fall asleep

by the time I get to
this part of the sentence.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.525

a hand with these pools?

06:40.525 --> 06:42.360
In a minute.

So, to continue,
the figure-eight dan...

Oh.

06:46.656 --> 06:47.908
Aw!

06:50.160 --> 06:52.662
(CANDACE SIGHS) Hi, honey.
Love the new look.

06:52.662 --> 06:55.123
You obviously don't know me.
Nobody does.

06:55.123 --> 06:57.417
And if somebody did,
I'd just deny it.

06:57.417 --> 07:00.378
Sweetie, I went through a similar
phase when I was your age.

07:00.378 --> 07:02.255
Try writing some poems.

07:02.255 --> 07:04.299
Whatever.
I don't care.

07:04.299 --> 07:06.051
No one gets me.

07:06.051 --> 07:08.053
Except my hair.
That's my girl.

07:08.136 --> 07:11.932
Okay, time to fill the
void in the power vacuum!

07:11.932 --> 07:13.558
'Cause, you see, it's a,
it's a real vacuum cleaner.

No? Wow.

07:15.518 --> 07:18.146

or you're just being stubborn.

pool party started!

He really nailed you.
It is uncanny.

07:56.101 --> 07:58.478
Well, I guess we can
test the pools out

07:58.478 --> 08:00.689
to make sure they're up
to our usual standards.

08:00.689 --> 08:03.316
Well, I guess
we can test the pools.

08:03.358 --> 08:04.484
Hey, look at me.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.361
(LAUGHS)
You guys are right.

08:06.361 --> 08:08.196
It's like listening
to a mirror.

this wading pool a try.

That's why I like it.

08:27.132 --> 08:29.217
Yes, thank you
for sharing.

08:29.217 --> 08:31.219
Whoa!
Whoo-hoo!

08:32.136 --> 08:33.679
Whoo-hoo!

08:37.808 --> 08:39.519
And now that the bees
are out of the way,

08:39.519 --> 08:41.062
let's try this baby out.

08:41.062 --> 08:42.688
Just a little spritz.

08:42.688 --> 08:43.815
Oh.

08:45.191 --> 08:46.651
Okay...

08:46.651 --> 08:49.195
Needs a little adjustment.

Hey, Charlene.
Here you go.

Oh, thanks, Heinz. I...

Wait, are you more
attractive all of a sudden?

09:00.081 --> 09:02.417
Oh, why, thank you.
I have been trying to...

09:02.417 --> 09:04.294
Oh, wait, no,
it's just the pheromones.

09:04.294 --> 09:06.171
Wow. Well,
it's really working

09:06.171 --> 09:09.549
because suddenly I can't
remember why we broke up.

09:09.591 --> 09:11.301
You said you hated
Mr. Tomato.

09:11.301 --> 09:12.343
Hello, Charlene.

Oh, hello, Mr. Tomato.

09:14.679 --> 09:17.849
Thanks for the reminder.
I'm out of here.

09:17.849 --> 09:19.434
You know, it wasn't
me she didn't like.

09:19.434 --> 09:20.727
Shut up.

09:21.561 --> 09:24.230
Whoo! Awesome!

09:24.230 --> 09:26.733
Whoo! Yeah!

09:26.733 --> 09:29.569
Yeah! What a thrill!

09:31.821 --> 09:35.575
BALJEET: Man!
That kid can wade!

09:35.617 --> 09:37.869
Sibling unit,
wading, wading.

09:37.869 --> 09:40.371
I sit here,
not relating.

09:40.371 --> 09:42.332
Wow! Pithy!

09:42.332 --> 09:44.375
Now we're cooking
with gas!

09:44.375 --> 09:46.127
Watch, Perry the Platypus,

09:46.127 --> 09:51.257
as I shpritz myself right into
ruling the Tri-State Area!

09:51.257 --> 09:55.136
Uh-oh. You know, I, I think it
might be time for Plan Bee!

09:55.136 --> 09:56.262
Ow! Ow!

09:58.598 --> 10:00.141
HEY, Stop it, stop it!

10:01.226 --> 10:02.727
Oh, they're all
over me! Aah!

10:02.727 --> 10:04.646
Get 'em off!
Get 'em off!

10:09.150 --> 10:11.778
Thank you for saving me,
Perry the Platypus.

10:11.778 --> 10:16.282
And on the bright side, with all
those bees, not one sting. Ow!

10:16.282 --> 10:18.743
Aw, man. (SLURRING) I
should've expected this, I...

10:18.743 --> 10:20.537
At least my inator
is intact.

10:23.373 --> 10:24.666
Ah, shoot!

10:24.666 --> 10:27.127
Curse you,
Perry the Platypus!

10:27.127 --> 10:31.798
Curse you. I said, "Curse
you, Perry the Platypus."

10:31.798 --> 10:34.551
Yeah, well, see, you should be
able to get it from context.

10:37.178 --> 10:39.430
BUFORD:
What the heck is that?

10:39.430 --> 10:43.143
PHINEAS: I have no idea, but
the bees sure seem to like it.

10:44.811 --> 10:49.190
And so continues the inevitability
of my mundane existence.

10:51.818 --> 10:54.320
Once again, I'm humiliated
by the universe.

10:56.281 --> 10:58.283
What just happened?
LINDA: Hey, kids!

10:58.283 --> 10:59.450
Anyone up for
some iced tea?

10:59.534 --> 11:01.953
Sure! Thanks, Mom.

11:01.953 --> 11:04.956
Oh, there you are, Perry.

11:04.956 --> 11:08.459
Oh, look! You kids found
Candace's old wading pool!

11:08.543 --> 11:09.711
How sweet!

11:09.711 --> 11:10.712
We're gonna have
a pool party.

11:10.712 --> 11:12.297
Go ahead,
wade away.

11:12.297 --> 11:13.590
Sorry we're late, Phineas.

11:13.590 --> 11:14.966
Our bee ceremony
ran long.

11:14.966 --> 11:16.676
No worries, Isabella.

11:16.718 --> 11:18.344
Go ahead and join
Mom in the fun!

11:18.344 --> 11:19.721
No worries, Isabella.

11:19.721 --> 11:21.723
(SPEAKING GIBBERISH)

11:21.723 --> 11:23.474
Hey, he does
a good you!

11:23.474 --> 11:25.602
Come on, girls,
let's hit the pool!

11:28.188 --> 11:30.690
Aw, it's just like
old times.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.442
Hey, Candace!
I just realized

11:32.442 --> 11:33.818
you added up
your score wrong.

11:33.818 --> 11:35.612
Your true teen identity
is actually

11:35.612 --> 11:38.198
the Busting and Crush
Obsessed Older Sister Type

11:38.198 --> 11:39.490
who can't do math.

11:39.574 --> 11:42.869
But, but, but, but,
but... Whatever.
