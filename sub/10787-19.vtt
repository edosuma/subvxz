TRUST ME. THERE IS
NOTHING FALSE ABOUT
THESE CONTRACTIONS.

02:06.250 --> 02:09.291
YOU'RE RIGHT, BUT
THEY'RE NOT ENOUGH
TO BRING ON DILATION.

NO CAUSE FOR CONCERN.

ALSO JOIN THE OTHER.

WHEN HE'S GONNA BE BACK
FROM HIS FISHING TRIP?

07:35.125 --> 07:40.250

HE'LL CALL YOU AS SOON
AS HE GETS BACK.

WRONG, ISN'T THERE?

DROPPED, AND THEN

SOME SENSE INTO HIM.

WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO WITH

PUT ALL THAT ASIDE

08:21.000 --> 08:22.667
AND TRY TO DO
EVERYTHING POSSIBLE

08:22.667 --> 08:24.834
TO MAKE PACEY'S LIFE
EASIER RIGHT NOW,

08:24.834 --> 08:26.834

HAVE MUCH OF ONE.

08:26.834 --> 08:29.125
HE'S IN A LOT OF PAIN,

PROMISE ME THAT YOU
WON'T DO ANYTHING

PRESSURE ON HIM

KNOW HOW I CAN GET
IN TOUCH WITH HIM?

YOU THAT, GRETCHEN.

BE THAT SELFISH?

TO TALK TO MY BOYFRIEND,

THAT YOU CAN GET
IN TOUCH WITH HIM--

GET BACK HERE

SURE THAT PACEY GETS

THINGS SEEM CONFUSING

09:15.542 --> 09:17.041
AND FRIGHTENING,

09:17.041 --> 09:19.458

FIND THE COURAGE
TO TAKE THE TEST,

CONSIDER YOUR OPTIONS.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.041
LOOK, IF YOU CHANGE
YOUR MIND, YOU CAN
ALWAYS COME BACK HERE...

09:28.041 --> 09:29.667
ANY TIME.

09:33.625 --> 09:38.708
OH, YOU GUYS,
I THOUGHT I MADE YOU
PROMISE--NO GIFTS.

09:38.708 --> 09:40.542
ASKING LADIES
NOT TO BRING GIFTS
TO A SHOWER

09:40.542 --> 09:43.417
IS LIKE ASKING THE
SUN NOT TO SHINE,

09:43.417 --> 09:46.417
BIRDS NOT TO SING.

09:46.417 --> 09:48.500
GOOD LORD. GIVE THIS
WOMAN A BALL OF YARN
AND SOME KNITTING NEEDLES,

09:48.500 --> 09:49.875
YOU'LL BE AMAZED WHAT
SHE CAN COME UP WITH.

09:49.875 --> 09:52.250
OH, EXCUSE ME.
MY KITCHEN'S CALLING.

09:52.250 --> 09:55.625
OH, HI, HONEY.

09:58.083 --> 10:01.083
DAWSON, WHY ISN'T
YOUR MOM, LIKE, ON THE COUCH
WITH HER FEET UP?

10:01.083 --> 10:02.291
OH, SHE'S NOT INTERESTED.

10:02.291 --> 10:04.208
SHE'S COOKING,
SHE'S CLEANING,
SHE'S RELENTLESS.

10:04.208 --> 10:05.750
NESTING INSTINCT.

10:05.750 --> 10:07.166
DO YOU WANT
SOME LAUNDRY DONE?
YOU COULD MAKE HER DAY.

10:07.166 --> 10:09.083
COME ON.

10:09.083 --> 10:10.083
HEY.

10:10.083 --> 10:14.500
HEY.

10:14.500 --> 10:15.583
I WENT TO THE BOOKSTORE
THIS MORNING

10:15.583 --> 10:17.667
AND LOOKED AT
SOME MAGAZINES--

10:17.667 --> 10:20.375
ONCE CERTAIN CITY
MAGAZINE IN PARTICULAR.

10:20.375 --> 10:21.417
IT'S A GREAT READ.

10:21.417 --> 10:22.875
I SPENT THE WHOLE
MORNING TRYING TO PACK,

10:22.875 --> 10:26.041
YOU KNOW,
AND I HAVE TO ADMIT,
I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS.

10:26.041 --> 10:28.250
I MEAN, THE ONLY REAL
JOB INTERVIEW I EVER HAD
WAS WITH YOUR MOTHER.

10:28.750 --> 10:30.208
MOM, I GOT IT.

10:30.208 --> 10:31.375
OH, THANKS, HONEY.

10:31.375 --> 10:33.208
AH! HI, GRETCH.
HI.

10:33.208 --> 10:34.166
HEY.

10:34.166 --> 10:35.208
HI, JOEY.

10:35.208 --> 10:37.083
HOW YOU DOIN'?

10:37.083 --> 10:38.417
FINE.

10:38.417 --> 10:40.083
LOOK, JOEY, IF YOU NEED
ANYTHING AT ALL, I'M HERE.

10:40.083 --> 10:43.917
WOULD YOU PLEASE
TELL MY SISTER TO GET
A LIFE OF HER OWN?

10:43.917 --> 10:45.166
YOUR BROTHER GOES FISHING,
AND, I SWEAR,

10:45.166 --> 10:46.291
SHE DOESN'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO WITH HERSELF.

10:46.291 --> 10:49.291
OH, JOEY!

10:49.291 --> 10:51.333
HI.
HI.

10:51.333 --> 10:52.166
OH, I HAVEN'T
SEEN YOU IN SO LONG.
HOW ARE YOU?

10:52.166 --> 10:53.208
NEVER BETTER.

10:53.208 --> 10:56.542
OH!

10:56.542 --> 11:00.458
OK! EVERYBODY,
LET'S GET STARTED.

11:00.458 --> 11:01.834
ARE YOU STAYING?

11:01.834 --> 11:03.041
I...

11:03.041 --> 11:04.500
TRADITION IS VERY CLEAR
ON THIS MATTER.

11:04.500 --> 11:05.625
NO MEN AT SHOWERS.

11:05.625 --> 11:08.000
WELL, IN CASE YOU
HAVEN'T NOTICED,

11:08.000 --> 11:10.208
WE'RE KIND OF
A NON-TRADITIONAL
HOUSEHOLD.

11:10.208 --> 11:11.583
THAT'S OK.
DAD AND I WILL LEAVE

11:11.583 --> 11:13.708
AND LET YOU WOMEN DO
WHATEVER IT IS YOU DO
AT THESE THINGS.

11:13.708 --> 11:15.542
COME ON, DAWSON.

11:15.542 --> 11:17.458
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE
BEFORE THE VAGINA
MONOLOGUES  START.

11:17.458 --> 11:19.250
OH!
OH!

11:23.667 --> 11:24.750
WILL, WHERE'S TOBEY?

11:24.750 --> 11:25.875
I DON'T KNOW.

11:25.875 --> 11:28.959
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HIM,
HEARD FROM HIM, ANYTHING?

11:28.959 --> 11:29.542
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

11:29.542 --> 11:31.834
FRANK, GET OFF THAT!

11:36.375 --> 11:38.834
IT'S MOVING.
IT'S ACTUALLY MOVING.

11:38.834 --> 11:39.834
WHERE DID YOU
LEARN THIS?

11:39.834 --> 11:43.333
GENERATIONS OF WOMEN
HAVE DONE THIS.

11:43.333 --> 11:46.667
IT WAS THE ULTRASOUND
OF THE MIDDLE AGES.

11:46.667 --> 11:49.250
SO WHAT IS IT?

11:49.250 --> 11:52.041
A BOY OR A GIRL?

11:52.041 --> 11:54.583
IT'S JUST WHAT YOU WANT.

11:54.583 --> 11:57.834
[LAUGHS]

11:57.834 --> 12:00.542
Bessie:
I'D LIKE TO GO FIRST.

12:00.542 --> 12:02.333
THESE ARE FROM
BODIE AND ME.

12:02.333 --> 12:03.417
SOPHIE.

12:03.417 --> 12:05.500
THAT'S AN ADORABLE NAME.

12:05.500 --> 12:07.750
IT MEANS "WISE."

12:07.750 --> 12:08.333
THAT'S WHAT WE WERE
GONNA NAME ALEXANDER
IF HE WAS A GIRL.

12:08.333 --> 12:10.542
HMM. SOPHIE LEERY.

12:10.542 --> 12:13.500
IF YOU HAVE A BOY...

12:13.500 --> 12:15.208
SATCHEL?

12:15.208 --> 12:16.750
Bessie:
HE PLAYED BASEBALL.

12:16.750 --> 12:18.750
BODIE SWORE
MITCH WOULD LOVE IT.

12:18.750 --> 12:20.000
[LADIES LAUGH]

12:22.375 --> 12:24.208
HERE WE GO.

12:24.208 --> 12:25.208
[LAUGHS]

12:25.208 --> 12:27.375
WHAT?

12:27.375 --> 12:28.125
[LAUGHS]

12:28.125 --> 12:30.500
SORRY. I DON'T
PICTURE YOU

12:30.500 --> 12:33.458
AS A STOGIE-SMOKING
KIND OF DAD.

12:33.458 --> 12:36.875
WELL, EVIDENTLY,
IT'S WHAT YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO DO

12:36.875 --> 12:37.959
AT A TIME LIKE THIS.

12:37.959 --> 12:39.417
ACCORDING TO WHO,
LARRY FLYNT?

12:39.417 --> 12:40.667
ACCORDING TO MR. KASDAN.

12:40.667 --> 12:42.208
IT WAS HIS GIFT.

12:42.208 --> 12:44.417
I TOLD HIM
I'D DO THIS WITH YOU.

12:44.417 --> 12:46.333
I DID NOT, HOWEVER,
PROMISE HIM

12:46.333 --> 12:49.959
THAT WE WOULD
ACTUALLY LIGHT
THESE DEADLY THINGS.

12:55.417 --> 12:56.750
[LADIES LAUGH]

12:56.750 --> 13:01.083
SO, YOU THINK
ANY OF THE NAMES

13:01.083 --> 13:02.959
THEY'RE KICKIN'
AROUND DOWN
THERE'LL STICK?

13:02.959 --> 13:05.959
I WONDER IF
OUR INABILITY
TO DECIDE ON A NAME

13:05.959 --> 13:07.458
MEANS THAT WE
AREN'T REALLY DEALING

13:07.458 --> 13:10.250
WITH WHAT'S ABOUT TO
HAPPEN IN OUR LIVES.

13:10.250 --> 13:11.625
YEAH, BUT
THE GOOD NEWS IS,

13:11.625 --> 13:13.708
YOU GUYS HAVE
HAD A BABY BEFORE,

13:13.708 --> 13:14.792
SO YOU KNOW
WHAT TO EXPECT, RIGHT?

13:14.792 --> 13:17.291
WANT TO KNOW THE TRUTH?

13:17.291 --> 13:21.792
HAVING A NEWBORN
IN YOUR LIFE IS PURE,
UNADULTERATED HELL.

13:21.792 --> 13:22.417
IT CAN'T BE THAT BAD.

13:22.417 --> 13:25.000
OH, BUT IT IS,

13:25.000 --> 13:28.125
UNLESS YOU
HAVE A BREAST.

13:28.125 --> 13:32.917
A MAN DOESN'T REALLY
LOVE A BABY THE WAY
A WOMAN DOES--

13:32.917 --> 13:33.959
NOT AT FIRST.

13:33.959 --> 13:37.125
A MAN LOVES THE IDEA
OF A BABY.

13:38.291 --> 13:38.959
THAT CHANGES, RIGHT?

13:40.375 --> 13:42.834
ONE NIGHT,

13:42.834 --> 13:46.500
YOU'RE STANDING
IN A DARK ROOM,

13:46.500 --> 13:47.625
EXHAUSTED,

13:47.625 --> 13:50.125
REACHING FOR DIAPERS

13:50.125 --> 13:53.291
AND ANSWERS ON A SHELF
YOU CAN'T SEE,

13:53.291 --> 13:58.041
AND THIS LITTLE PERSON
CALLS OUT TO YOU.

13:59.667 --> 14:01.291
"DADDY."

14:03.834 --> 14:05.166
THAT'S WHEN YOU GET IT.

14:07.500 --> 14:11.834
YOU FEEL YOUR HEART
EXPAND IN A WAY

14:11.834 --> 14:13.250
YOU NEVER KNEW
WAS POSSIBLE,

14:13.250 --> 14:16.750
AND YOU LOVE THIS
LITTLE PERSON SO MUCH...

14:17.750 --> 14:20.792
THAT YOU ACTUALLY ACHE.

14:28.792 --> 14:31.834
I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT
ANY BETTER.

14:32.834 --> 14:35.125
I THINK THE REASON
YOU GUYS ARE WAITING

14:35.125 --> 14:37.792
IS BECAUSE YOU DON'T
WANT TO JUST SLAP
A NAME ON THIS IDEA.

14:37.792 --> 14:39.208
I THINK YOU
WANT TO GET A SENSE

14:39.208 --> 14:42.542
OF WHO THIS NEW MEMBER
OF OUR FAMILY IS,

14:42.542 --> 14:46.417
AND I THINK WHEN YOU
MEET HIM, YOU'LL KNOW.

14:50.250 --> 14:52.458
YOU'RE A PRETTY
SMART KID, DAWSON.

14:52.458 --> 14:54.667
HA HA HA!

14:55.375 --> 14:57.875
IF I WERE TO
HAVE A GIRL,

14:57.875 --> 14:58.875
I THINK I'D
NAME HER EMMA.

14:58.875 --> 15:03.041
AND FOR A BOY,
MAYBE JACKSON?

15:03.041 --> 15:04.875
JACKSON POLLOCK.

15:04.875 --> 15:05.583
MADE A
BEAUTIFUL MESS.

15:05.583 --> 15:08.125
[LADIES LAUGH]

15:08.125 --> 15:10.083
MY FAVORITE BOYS' NAME--KURT.

15:10.083 --> 15:10.750
STRONG NAME.

15:10.750 --> 15:12.542
FOR KURT DONALD COBAIN.

15:12.542 --> 15:13.834
HA HA HA!

15:13.834 --> 15:15.750
Gretchen: AND MY FAVORITE
GIRLS' NAME--

15:15.750 --> 15:17.083
ISABELLA,

15:17.083 --> 15:18.834
AFTER A STORY
THAT MY GRANDMOTHER
USED TO TELL ME

15:18.834 --> 15:19.917
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL.

15:19.917 --> 15:22.333
THERE ARE MANY FLOWERS
IN THE GARDEN,

15:22.333 --> 15:25.333
BUT THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
WILL ALWAYS BE ROSE.

15:25.333 --> 15:27.583
ROSE LEERY.

15:27.583 --> 15:31.708
AND FOR A BOY, THOMAS,

15:31.708 --> 15:35.667
FOR SOMEONE I KNEW
A LONG TIME AGO.

15:39.417 --> 15:43.417
GRETCHEN'S PROBABLY
GONNA TAKE A JOB
IN BOSTON.

15:43.417 --> 15:45.583
YOU THINK
IT'S A REACTION

15:45.583 --> 15:46.917
TO YOU
GETTING INTO USC?

15:46.917 --> 15:48.250
A WAY OF
PROTECTING HERSELF?

15:49.291 --> 15:50.750
I DON'T KNOW.

15:50.750 --> 15:53.792
I MEAN, I NEVER
EXPECTED HER TO
FOLLOW ME TO CALIFORNIA,

15:53.792 --> 15:56.250
AND IT'S A GREAT
OPPORTUNITY.

15:56.250 --> 15:58.291
I'M REALLY HAPPY
FOR HER, BUT--

15:58.291 --> 16:00.208
WELL, JUST REMEMBER,
A COUPLE YEARS AGO,

16:00.208 --> 16:01.083
YOUR MOTHER AND I
GOT A DIVORCE.

16:01.083 --> 16:04.208
NOW WE'RE MORE
IN LOVE THAN EVER.

16:04.208 --> 16:08.917
SO YOU'RE SAYING
MAYBE EVEN IF WE BREAK UP,

16:08.917 --> 16:11.708
WE'RE STILL DESTINED
TO BE TOGETHER?

16:11.708 --> 16:14.458
I'M SAYING YOU HAVE TO
FOLLOW YOUR OWN PATH,

16:14.458 --> 16:16.583
BECAUSE WITH EVERYTHING
ELSE IN THIS LIFE,

16:16.583 --> 16:17.166
YOU JUST NEVER KNOW.

16:20.333 --> 16:22.291
LOOK AT YOU AND JOEY.

16:22.291 --> 16:23.667
HEH.

16:27.917 --> 16:31.375
WELL, I WAS UP
ALL NIGHT LAST NIGHT,

16:31.375 --> 16:33.041
AND I COULDN'T
THINK OF A NAME,

16:33.041 --> 16:35.750
BUT I BROUGHT YOU
THIS INSTEAD.

16:35.750 --> 16:38.125
I THINK IT EMBODIES
EVERYTHING THAT
A NAME SHOULD.

16:38.875 --> 16:41.583
IT USED TO BELONG TO DAWSON,

16:41.583 --> 16:44.166
AND, AT SOME POINT,
I'M SURE HIS LITTLE
BROTHER OR SISTER

16:44.166 --> 16:46.375
WILL LIKE TO WEAR IT.

16:46.375 --> 16:49.500
IT'S GETTING HARDER TO
TELL WHAT'S RIGHT ANYMORE,

16:49.500 --> 16:50.500
SO I HOPE YOU LIKE IT.

16:50.500 --> 16:53.083
WELL, OF COURSE IT'S OK,
HONEY. THANK YOU.

16:53.083 --> 16:56.583
I'M SURE DAWSON WILL BE
AS TOUCHED AS I AM.

17:00.125 --> 17:02.375
AND THANK ALL OF YOU.

17:02.375 --> 17:06.125
YOU HAVE GIVEN ME
SO MUCH TO THINK ABOUT
DURING THIS LABOR

17:06.125 --> 17:08.500
INSTEAD OF
MY CONTRACTIONS.

17:08.500 --> 17:09.625
WELL, YOU CAN BE THANKFUL
THAT YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE

THE MIDDLE OF A HURRICANE.

17:12.666 --> 17:13.791
LET'S HOPE NOT.

17:13.791 --> 17:16.458
AS BAD AS THAT WAS,
IT WASN'T NEAR AS DIFFICULT

17:16.458 --> 17:18.541
AS WHAT I SAW
MY MOTHER GO THROUGH.

17:18.541 --> 17:20.750
LILLIAN WAS
AN AMAZING WOMAN.

17:20.750 --> 17:23.375

34 HOURS AFTER
HER WATER BROKE,

17:25.416 --> 17:27.040
THE BABY STILL
HADN'T APPEARED.

SO, WHAT MADE YOU FINALLY
DECIDE TO COME OUT AND
MAKE YOUR GRAND ENTRANCE?

17:29.208 --> 17:32.208
MY MOTHER STARTED
CALLING OUT HER NAME--

"JOSEPHINE! JOSEPHINE!

17:33.375 --> 17:35.041

WAITING TO MEET YOU,"

17:35.041 --> 17:37.000

17:37.000 --> 17:40.166

CHOCOLATE HAIR,

17:40.166 --> 17:43.166
THESE CURIOUS,
SAUCER EYES,

17:43.166 --> 17:46.208
AND A POUT WE
ALL KNOW WAY TOO WELL.

17:59.708 --> 18:01.000
YOU ALL RIGHT?

18:01.000 --> 18:03.959
Tobey: I'VE
GOT THE FLU.

18:03.959 --> 18:06.250
YOU DON'T SOUND SICK.

18:06.250 --> 18:07.959
[COUGHS] IT'S BAD.

18:07.959 --> 18:09.250
I'M HIGHLY
CONTAGIOUS.

18:09.250 --> 18:10.750
GO AWAY.

18:10.750 --> 18:12.750
I JUST HAD THE FLU.

18:12.750 --> 18:15.917
THIS IS A DIFFERENT
STRAIN--STRAIN "D."

18:15.917 --> 18:17.417
YOU HAVEN'T
HAD THIS. [COUGHS]

18:17.417 --> 18:20.583
COME ON, TOBEY.
OPEN UP.

18:20.583 --> 18:22.417
COME ON, MAN.

18:24.583 --> 18:26.750
SOME FLU.

18:26.750 --> 18:29.792
YEAH. DON'T FREAK.

18:29.792 --> 18:31.083
IT ONLY HURTS
WHEN I BLINK.

18:31.083 --> 18:32.959
WHAT HAPPENED?

18:32.959 --> 18:36.208
I HAD A DIVERGENCE
OF OPINION

18:36.208 --> 18:37.417
ON HOW A COUPLE OF
LOCAL ENTREPRENEURS

18:37.417 --> 18:40.875
SHOULD PAY FOR
THEIR CRACK, AND I
LOST THE DISPUTE.

18:40.875 --> 18:42.041
SO YOU GOT MUGGED.

18:42.041 --> 18:42.875
YEAH.

18:42.875 --> 18:43.875
NOW, LOOK,
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

18:43.875 --> 18:46.417
MY ICE PACK
IS THAWING.

18:46.417 --> 18:47.000
HEH.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.375
DID YOU REPORT IT?

18:49.375 --> 18:51.875
LOOK, IT WAS
A MUGGING. THEY
GOT 12 BUCKS.

18:51.875 --> 18:52.917
IT'S NOT WORTH
THE TROUBLE.

18:52.917 --> 18:54.041
COME ON.
I DON'T WANT TO
TALK ABOUT IT.

18:54.041 --> 18:55.625
IT'LL TAKE 10 MINUTES.
WE JUST GO TO THE COPS--

18:55.625 --> 18:56.667
WHAT AM I
GONNA TELL 'EM?

18:56.667 --> 18:58.291
THAT I FRIGHTEN

39:13.542 --> 39:15.583
[LAUGHS]

39:15.583 --> 39:17.250
[LAUGHS]

39:17.250 --> 39:19.542
WELCOME
TO OUR FAMILY.

39:19.542 --> 39:22.000
YOU COULDN'T HAVE
PICKED A BETTER ONE.

39:50.917 --> 39:52.792
[RING]

39:53.291 --> 39:54.208
HELLO.

39:54.208 --> 39:55.291
HEY, GRETCHEN
TOLD ME

39:55.291 --> 39:57.375
I HAD TO CALL
IMMEDIATELY.
WHAT'S WRONG?

39:58.542 --> 39:59.500
ACTUALLY, NOTHING.

39:59.500 --> 40:03.208
I THOUGHT I HAD
A HUGE PROBLEM,

40:03.208 --> 40:04.834
BUT, UM...

40:04.834 --> 40:06.041
I WAS WRONG.

40:06.041 --> 40:07.500
WELL, WHAT KIND
OF PROBLEM DID YOU
THINK YOU HAD?

40:07.500 --> 40:11.125
IT'S NOTHING THAT
YOU SHOULD WORRY ABOUT.

40:13.375 --> 40:16.708
THE IMPORTANT THING IS
THAT YOU FOCUS ON YOURSELF.

40:19.583 --> 40:21.959
WHERE ARE YOU?

40:24.875 --> 40:25.542
I TOLD YOU, I'M
FISHING WITH DOUGIE.

40:27.750 --> 40:29.417
WE'RE HAVING THE TIME
OF OUR LIVES OUT HERE.

40:29.417 --> 40:32.417
CAUGHT A 90-POUND
MARLIN YESTERDAY.

40:32.417 --> 40:34.125
WE'RE LIVING
THE HIGH LIFE, JO.

40:34.125 --> 40:37.583
THE HIGH LIFE.

40:37.583 --> 40:39.917
YOU AND I GOT TO GET
OUT HERE SOME TIME.

40:45.041 --> 40:48.583
YEAH, WE WILL.

40:48.583 --> 40:50.542
WE'LL HAVE TO DO
THAT REAL SOON.

40:53.250 --> 40:54.417
YEAH.

40:55.333 --> 40:55.542
I MISS YOU.

40:58.917 --> 41:00.750
I MISS YOU, PACE.

41:36.750 --> 41:38.458
I THOUGHT YOU HAD
A TRAIN TO CATCH.

41:40.125 --> 41:41.750
YOU KNOW THE BEST
THING ABOUT TRAINS?

41:43.166 --> 41:45.000
THERE'S ALWAYS
A LATER ONE.

41:59.041 --> 42:00.583
[LAUGHS]

42:00.583 --> 42:02.250
THIS IS CRAZY.

42:02.250 --> 42:03.458
INSANE.

42:04.458 --> 42:06.083
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

42:06.083 --> 42:07.208
PROLONGING
THE INEVITABLE.

42:07.208 --> 42:10.625
LIVING IN DENIAL.

42:10.625 --> 42:12.792
WHO KNEW DENIAL COULD
FEEL THIS GOOD?

42:13.875 --> 42:15.667
YOU KNOW THERE'S
NO HOPE FOR US.

42:15.667 --> 42:16.834
HOW COULD THERE BE?

42:16.834 --> 42:18.208
WE'RE HEADED IN COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS.

42:18.208 --> 42:19.583
WE MIGHT AS WELL BE GOING
TO 2 DIFFERENT PLANETS.

42:19.583 --> 42:22.792
WE SHOULD REALLY
BREAK UP RIGHT NOW.

42:22.792 --> 42:24.041
JUST GET IT OVER WITH.

42:24.041 --> 42:24.875
I AGREE.

42:24.875 --> 42:27.875
I NEVER WANT
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
