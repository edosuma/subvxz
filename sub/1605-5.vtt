BELL: "In a world filled with
hate, we must still dare to hope.

01:20.563 --> 01:24.400
"In a world filled with despair,
we must still dare to dream."

01:25.443 --> 01:28.363
Words from the late,
great Michael Jackson.

01:28.904 --> 01:31.199
Chapel will open at 8:00.

01:31.533 --> 01:35.786
Today's order of services
is Catholic, Evangelical,

01:35.911 --> 01:39.541
Wiccan, Baptist,
other, and Muslim.

01:39.624 --> 01:41.292
Enjoy your Sunday.

(MELLOW SONG PLAYING)

02:11.197 --> 02:14.367
You didn't eat breakfast. Most
important meal of the day.

02:16.077 --> 02:17.579
Start your engine right.

02:17.662 --> 02:18.663
Thanks. I'll, uh...

02:21.082 --> 02:22.083
Thanks.

02:22.417 --> 02:24.627
Fine. Run on fumes.

02:26.295 --> 02:27.838
I'm doing the
4-Hour Body.

02:28.339 --> 02:29.757
I don't know what that is.

02:29.882 --> 02:32.552
Oh, you'll see.
You'll see.

02:33.052 --> 02:35.346
Okay. Good luck
with that.

03:20.141 --> 03:22.143
(CLUCKING)

03:34.489 --> 03:36.157
LORNA: Come closer!

03:36.282 --> 03:39.952
Oh! Fuck me! God!

03:41.329 --> 03:43.080
I could get it.
Fucking come.

03:43.164 --> 03:44.457
(SQUEALING)

03:44.540 --> 03:47.376
Yes! Yeah! Yeah!
You fucking skank!

03:49.671 --> 03:50.630
Yeah!

03:50.713 --> 03:52.006
(MOANING)

03:54.342 --> 03:55.426
Finally!

03:56.093 --> 03:59.597
Man, look how buff my left arm
looks just from grabbling you.

04:01.766 --> 04:03.142
Nichols, we gotta stop.

04:03.225 --> 04:04.268
No, we can't.

04:04.352 --> 04:05.592
I gotta work out
the other side.

04:05.687 --> 04:08.606
Otherwise I'll be asymmetrical
like a crab, or a tennis pro.

04:08.690 --> 04:11.484
No, no, no.
No more. I'm engaged.

04:11.567 --> 04:13.152
Yeah, that's right.

04:14.111 --> 04:15.363
Get it while you can.

04:15.446 --> 04:17.740
No! No, it's not
fair to Christopher.

04:17.865 --> 04:19.826
And I need to
start tightening up.

04:19.908 --> 04:21.869
You're making me
feel like a cave.

04:21.994 --> 04:25.289
Baby, it's a cunt.
Huh? It stretches.

04:25.498 --> 04:27.875
Yeah, sometimes I feel like you're
trying to climb inside my womb.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.877
What can I say,
I've got mommy issues.

04:30.002 --> 04:32.880
Well, I don't want
to do it anymore.

04:33.005 --> 04:34.882
This was the last time.

04:37.218 --> 04:40.555
All right. Yeah, it's cool. Just at
least get me off first, all right?

04:40.680 --> 04:42.515
That's not very classy.

04:42.598 --> 04:44.392
We're having sex
in a fucking chapel.

04:44.517 --> 04:45.997
Come on, you wanna
give me blue balls?

04:46.227 --> 04:47.729
PENNSATUCKY: It's not fair.
I wake up every day and I...

04:47.854 --> 04:49.188
Fuck!
Shit!

04:53.150 --> 04:55.903
I thought you said the service
wasn't for another half hour.

04:56.028 --> 04:57.655
It was. You take
too long to come.

04:57.739 --> 05:01.409
Chaplain, the Jews never put
the markers back in the box.

05:01.534 --> 05:03.703
So write to your Congressman.

05:03.786 --> 05:05.162
What if he's a Jewish?

05:05.246 --> 05:09.834
There is one art cabinet for
everyone and you have to share.

05:09.917 --> 05:13.671
Now, if you please, we need
to get ready for mass.

05:13.755 --> 05:16.340
Sister? The candles.
Yes.

05:17.091 --> 05:18.593
My service is coming up.

05:18.718 --> 05:20.428
I wanna hang up my decoration.

05:20.553 --> 05:21.637
Your decoration?

05:22.304 --> 05:25.558
Yep. Look at it.
I made it in the shop.

05:26.141 --> 05:27.727
Except for it's not
done on account that

05:27.852 --> 05:29.492
I ran out of glow-in-the-dark
paint, but...

05:29.520 --> 05:30.937
Doggett, get it out of here.

05:31.063 --> 05:32.440
What? Why?

05:32.565 --> 05:34.941
You know why. I have
explained it to you.

05:35.067 --> 05:37.820
It's not iconography,
it's a cross.

05:37.944 --> 05:39.280
Nothing goes on the walls

05:39.405 --> 05:42.991
that can't be taken down
before the next service.

05:43.117 --> 05:44.368
It's gonna glow in the dark.

05:44.493 --> 05:46.746
Now, Doggett!

05:47.872 --> 05:49.123
You know what? Fine.

05:49.791 --> 05:51.375
That's just fine.

05:54.879 --> 05:56.963
It ain't right,
and you know it.

05:57.047 --> 05:59.675
Well, this chapel is
not just for Christians.

05:59.801 --> 06:03.220
(SCOFFING) Yeah. I'm sure if I was a
Catholic, you would be much different.

06:03.304 --> 06:04.388
That's not true.

06:04.472 --> 06:05.972
Yep. It's very true.

06:06.098 --> 06:08.643
'Cause you and that Pope's
bitch are running this place!

06:09.310 --> 06:11.771
I like to think of myself
as more of the Pope's homie.

06:11.854 --> 06:13.689
PENNSATUCKY: You know what?

06:13.980 --> 06:17.735
You treat everybody here better than me.
Even those witch ladies.

06:17.819 --> 06:19.445
Also not true.

06:19.528 --> 06:22.114
No, it is true. You let... You
take them for walks and you...

06:22.197 --> 06:26.452
As I would take you if your faith
required communion with nature.

06:26.535 --> 06:28.496
I don't want to walk! Okay?

06:28.621 --> 06:31.206
I'm gonna hang this damn cross!

06:31.332 --> 06:34.585
'Cause it's my religious freedom
and you're violating it!

06:39.507 --> 06:40.508
BIG BOO: You could sue.

06:40.675 --> 06:43.218
I heard about this
tranny in Massachusetts.

06:43.344 --> 06:45.930
State paid for
her whole hoo-ha.

06:46.012 --> 06:47.598
I don't need them
to pay for the car.

06:47.723 --> 06:49.308
I just need them
to buy the oil.

06:49.433 --> 06:50.768
(CHUCKLES)

06:51.894 --> 06:56.231
What exactly is going on with you anyway?
Is it like menopause?

06:56.440 --> 06:58.442
Same idea.
Not enough lady juice.

06:58.526 --> 07:01.403
Skin gets loose, tits get saggy.
Hulk get angry.

07:01.529 --> 07:03.489
Oh, God! Do not do that!

07:03.572 --> 07:04.657
(CHUCKLING)

07:04.740 --> 07:06.033
Jesus.

07:06.868 --> 07:07.869
I know what you can do.

07:07.994 --> 07:11.205
You find an old lady lifer
and you bum her estrogen.

07:11.413 --> 07:14.458
You think the Fed gives a shit
about a felon's hot flashes?

07:14.542 --> 07:16.210
None of that gets covered.

07:16.293 --> 07:19.129
Nun gets it. I'm on
the pill line with her.

07:19.463 --> 07:22.049
Bullshit. It's probably
just anti-depressants.

07:22.216 --> 07:25.761
Oh, really? Ever heard of
an SSRI called Gynotab?

07:27.930 --> 07:31.726
Ow! What the fuck?
Girl, you pulled my hair!

07:31.851 --> 07:33.060
WOMAN OVER PA:
Any available CO

07:33.185 --> 07:34.353
to outer gate for
inmate transfer.

07:34.436 --> 07:37.157
You don't fucking talk to me, but you
want me to thread your eyebrows?

07:37.231 --> 07:39.025
Nobody else can do them right.

07:39.107 --> 07:42.904
Besides, we're family. We fight,
but we do shit for each other.

07:43.195 --> 07:44.822
You gonna let me play dominos?

07:45.656 --> 07:47.115
You can keep score.

07:48.409 --> 07:49.660
You got some thread?

07:51.245 --> 07:53.497
MAN OVER PA:
All personnel, 10-21 Jasmine.

07:54.623 --> 07:57.585
Here. Go find Gloria,
see if she'll trade with you.

07:57.710 --> 07:59.511
If not, I'll pull some
threads from my jacket.

08:00.254 --> 08:01.255
All right.

08:04.508 --> 08:06.134
Hey. What are you doing?

08:06.552 --> 08:07.553
Trading corn.

08:07.929 --> 08:09.329
Inmates aren't
authorized to barter.

08:09.430 --> 08:11.098
What the fuck is "barter"?
Trade.

08:11.181 --> 08:12.433
Oh, come on. Everybody trades...
Hey!

08:12.558 --> 08:14.101
You want to get written up?
Is that what you want?

08:14.268 --> 08:15.436
What do you want from me?

08:15.561 --> 08:19.356
What do I want?
Less attitude! You got that?

08:19.440 --> 08:22.443
You're not in charge here.
I am.

08:23.069 --> 08:24.236
Now give me the corn.

08:24.361 --> 08:25.529
Yes, sir.

08:28.407 --> 08:30.284
Damn, y'all saw that?

08:31.243 --> 08:33.955
He fucking took my corn!

08:42.630 --> 08:46.008
WOMAN ON TV: Come on down to the
hottest spot south of Havana!

08:46.133 --> 08:48.427
Brazil's Copacabana Beach.

08:48.510 --> 08:50.220
But I would be careful.

08:50.304 --> 08:53.515
Some of the most beautiful
places along the beach are...

09:01.023 --> 09:02.066
Whatcha making?

09:02.149 --> 09:04.276
I'm knitting.
Oh.

09:07.237 --> 09:09.364
I'm sorry, do I smell?

09:09.490 --> 09:13.119
No, she's just in the zone.
How's your Sunday?

09:13.201 --> 09:15.830
Pretty nice so far.
I was outside.

09:16.122 --> 09:19.333
It is beautiful up
here in the fall.

09:19.792 --> 09:21.168
Oh, yeah, sure.

09:21.251 --> 09:24.839
I got myself incarcerated just so
I could see the changing colors.

09:24.922 --> 09:27.842
I'm serious. I think I
need to be outside more.

09:27.925 --> 09:29.176
Weren't you cold?

09:29.301 --> 09:30.845
A little.
But it was lovely.

09:30.928 --> 09:32.972
I had my tea,
it was almost hot.

09:33.055 --> 09:35.016
I had my book,
it was almost good.

09:35.099 --> 09:36.767
And I saw a chicken.

09:38.019 --> 09:39.353
How random is that?

09:46.360 --> 09:47.361
What? What?

09:50.114 --> 09:52.491
You saw a chicken? Like, a real
live chicken in the flesh?

09:52.574 --> 09:55.410
Well, it was covered
in feathers, but...

09:57.746 --> 09:58.873
(SIGHING)

10:03.627 --> 10:04.753
What's going on?

10:04.879 --> 10:06.213
You need to talk to Red.

10:07.006 --> 10:08.090
About what?

10:08.215 --> 10:09.842
You just need to talk to her.

10:13.220 --> 10:15.890
WOMAN OVER PA: CO to Main
Control for a shift briefing.

10:34.742 --> 10:36.911
Dayanara!
I unclogged the toilet.

10:37.036 --> 10:38.871
There was a Barbie in it.

10:39.914 --> 10:40.873
Eva?

10:40.956 --> 10:43.625
What? Barbie wanted
to go scuba diving!

10:46.087 --> 10:48.005
Ow, Mommy! Help me!
Aah!

10:48.089 --> 10:49.924
Sucio! Get your caqui fingers off me.
Dios mio!

10:50.049 --> 10:51.926
She's gonna hit me!

10:52.426 --> 10:53.594
You trying to hit your sister?

10:53.719 --> 10:55.846
She flushed a Barbie
down the toilet!

10:58.265 --> 10:59.975
The Barbie Cesar bought you?

11:01.518 --> 11:03.604
You think Barbies
grow on trees?

11:03.729 --> 11:06.314
You think toilets
grow on trees? Huh?

11:06.440 --> 11:07.441
No.

11:07.524 --> 11:09.484
What grows on trees?
Nothing.

11:09.610 --> 11:12.613
That's right! You need to
look after them better.

11:12.738 --> 11:13.781
How about you?

11:13.948 --> 11:15.032
I got better things to do.

11:15.616 --> 11:19.578
Get them a pizza if they're hungry.
I'm eating oysters, bitches.

11:20.246 --> 11:21.496
Whatever.

11:33.092 --> 11:34.176
I want oysters.

11:34.300 --> 11:35.469
No, you don't.

11:36.262 --> 11:40.099
You're sure it was a chicken?
Not a pigeon?

11:40.182 --> 11:41.225
No.

11:41.809 --> 11:43.811
What about
a quail or a pheasant?

11:43.894 --> 11:45.187
Spruce grouse?

11:45.311 --> 11:46.354
American bald eagle?

11:46.480 --> 11:48.983
It was a chicken. I know
what a chicken looks like.

11:49.108 --> 11:51.610
I don't...
What's the big deal?

11:54.029 --> 11:58.284
There are no chickens around here.
Except for one.

11:58.366 --> 12:00.535
They say she lived
on a farm near here.

12:00.661 --> 12:03.289
Till one night,
the night before

12:03.371 --> 12:06.000
all the other chickens
were slaughtered,

12:07.501 --> 12:09.170
she escaped.

12:09.878 --> 12:13.841
She's been out there ever
since, living off the land.

12:14.716 --> 12:16.342
Living on her wits.

12:16.468 --> 12:18.679
Hey, what's going on?

12:18.762 --> 12:19.888
The chicken's back.

12:20.181 --> 12:23.684
Oh, give me a break.
Mom, there is no chicken.

12:23.809 --> 12:26.728
You're wrong!
She saw it.

12:26.854 --> 12:28.272
Oh, really?
Mmm-hmm.

12:28.354 --> 12:29.815
How'd it get over the fence?

12:29.940 --> 12:31.357
I don't know. It flew?

12:31.483 --> 12:34.486
Chickens don't fly. It was
probably a spruce grouse.

12:34.569 --> 12:38.032
No, it was her.
I saw it in a dream.

12:39.365 --> 12:40.617
Goodbye.

12:42.119 --> 12:45.539
She came to me,
already dressed in herbs,

12:45.622 --> 12:49.375
and a little top hat,
black, tilted to one side.

12:49.501 --> 12:52.921
And she said, "Soon, Red,
we will be together.

12:53.047 --> 12:55.257
"Soon I will be yours."

12:55.381 --> 12:57.259
No more processed chicken

12:57.383 --> 13:01.305
that looks like a hockey puck
and tastes like wet paper.

13:02.139 --> 13:04.808
Real chicken Kiev.

13:08.145 --> 13:11.065
First girl to bag that bird

13:11.148 --> 13:14.235
gets a box of Biore strips.

13:17.529 --> 13:18.572
Me, too?

13:20.241 --> 13:21.992
Yes. You, too.

13:22.076 --> 13:23.702
You did good
bringing this to me.

13:24.912 --> 13:27.748
Maybe you're not as
useless as I thought.

13:32.711 --> 13:34.838
Sister Ingalls.
How was your service?

13:34.922 --> 13:36.924
Oh, fine. Thank you
for asking. Uh...

13:37.049 --> 13:38.926
Sophia. Sophia. That's right.

13:39.009 --> 13:40.468
What was your sermon about?

13:40.594 --> 13:43.097
Oh, I don't give sermons.
I'm not a priest.

13:43.180 --> 13:46.392
But we did have a good group
discussion about overcoming sin.

13:46.474 --> 13:47.893
Oh, I'm sorry I missed that.

13:47.976 --> 13:49.477
Really?
Are you Catholic?

13:49.603 --> 13:53.607
No! But... Well, I think a
lot about overcoming sin.

13:54.108 --> 13:56.360
And I just love Jesus Christ.

13:56.442 --> 14:00.239
And I've always wanted to try
one of those communion wafers.

14:00.322 --> 14:02.324
Well, I have a box
of a thousand.

14:02.448 --> 14:04.450
They're not as fresh as the
ones you get outside of prison,

14:04.534 --> 14:05.619
but they're good with dip.

14:05.786 --> 14:07.121
(LAUGHING)

14:07.246 --> 14:09.164
Oh, I forgot my hat.

14:09.290 --> 14:10.291
Mind if I come with you?

14:10.456 --> 14:11.458
Not at all.

14:11.541 --> 14:13.919
PENNSATUCKY: Okay,
higher. Higher.

14:14.002 --> 14:15.921
Yep, higher. Nope, wait!

14:16.004 --> 14:18.090
No! To... Okay, now to...

14:18.715 --> 14:21.302
Look, that doesn't look
centered to me, it just...

14:21.427 --> 14:22.970
Excuse me!

14:23.595 --> 14:26.598
Oh, hey, Sister. Ain't
your time through here?

14:26.681 --> 14:27.975
I thought you weren't
allowed to put that up.

14:28.100 --> 14:29.101
No?

14:29.310 --> 14:32.146
That's what the chaplain
told you this morning.

14:32.271 --> 14:33.355
Oh, yeah, that's right.

14:33.480 --> 14:35.857
You're the little church mouse
that lives in her pocket.

14:36.275 --> 14:37.692
Well, I live in God's pocket.

14:37.818 --> 14:39.619
And she said I couldn't
put it up on the walls,

14:39.694 --> 14:40.946
but she didn't say
I couldn't hang it

14:41.071 --> 14:42.392
from the ceiling,
all right? So...

14:42.448 --> 14:44.032
That's not
a load-bearing pipe.

14:44.158 --> 14:47.035
What do you know about a
load-bearing pipe, lady man?

14:47.619 --> 14:49.288
I think I just told you.

14:49.413 --> 14:50.998
Please.
I'll just get my hat.

14:51.123 --> 14:53.167
It's not my business.
I don't want any trouble.

14:53.292 --> 14:55.252
Trouble? There's not gonna
be any trouble, okay?

14:55.336 --> 14:57.129
This is beautiful.

14:57.212 --> 15:01.008
All right? It's our right as
Americans to religious freedom.

15:01.800 --> 15:03.320
Ain't you heard of
the Third Amendment?

15:03.344 --> 15:06.472
Soldiers should not be given quarter
in a house in times of peace?

15:06.554 --> 15:08.314
Is that really what
the Third Amendment says?

15:08.349 --> 15:09.557
I never knew that.

15:09.683 --> 15:10.684
Can you stay out of it?

15:10.767 --> 15:12.019
(PIPE SNAPPING)
(GASPS)

15:13.770 --> 15:15.939
Oh, damn it, Tucky.
I can't go back to seg.

15:33.623 --> 15:36.418
God has chosen to
test our conviction.

15:40.755 --> 15:43.633
So Red's okay with me because
I saw this chicken, I guess.

15:43.717 --> 15:45.552
And she said I wasn't useless.

15:46.720 --> 15:47.804
Wow.

15:47.888 --> 15:49.014
Good.

15:49.639 --> 15:53.727
So that's the big
news in my small world.

15:53.894 --> 15:55.020
Um...

15:56.604 --> 15:58.857
What's happening with Barney's?
Did you talk to Weiner?

15:58.940 --> 16:02.444
Yes, I have.
Actually, there is...

16:02.652 --> 16:05.572
Oh, well, it's funny,
but there's a problem.

16:06.073 --> 16:07.115
What?

16:07.241 --> 16:09.117
They have concerns
about our ability to

16:09.243 --> 16:11.119
produce since we
still don't have a space.

16:11.245 --> 16:12.913
You told them that?
They don't need to know that.

16:12.996 --> 16:14.077
Why did you tell them that?

16:14.498 --> 16:15.916
I don't know,
because they asked?

16:17.501 --> 16:19.586
I'm sorry, should I
have texted you first?

16:20.212 --> 16:21.612
We don't have
an official order yet.

16:21.629 --> 16:22.990
They could take
us off the shelves.

16:23.048 --> 16:26.593
Well, you know, I was thinking maybe
that wouldn't be such a bad idea.

16:28.929 --> 16:30.097
Excuse me?

16:30.180 --> 16:33.475
I mean, maybe it's not the best
time to expand our business.

16:33.600 --> 16:35.685
Polly, I quit my job for this.

16:35.769 --> 16:37.604
And then you went to prison.

16:37.687 --> 16:39.727
If I'd known you wouldn't
be around to handle things,

16:39.773 --> 16:41.816
I would have delayed the
baby and gotten a puppy.

16:41.942 --> 16:46.780
But I'm the size of Venus and
allergic to dogs, so... Fuck it.

16:46.905 --> 16:48.282
Polly, we were counting
on the extra income.

16:48.407 --> 16:49.783
Please, like you even pay rent.

16:49.908 --> 16:51.285
I pay rent. Who told
you I don't pay rent?

16:51.410 --> 16:54.496
Polly, I know that you're having
a baby, but what about our baby?

16:54.580 --> 16:55.789
What about Baby Poppy?

16:55.956 --> 16:59.667
What if Piper talks to Weiner? You
have more of a rapport, right?

16:59.793 --> 17:01.587
Yes! She likes me!

17:01.669 --> 17:04.298
So, should I see if she'll
drive up with us next week?

17:04.381 --> 17:07.468
No. We can set up a call.

17:07.550 --> 17:09.970
I'll call you, and then
the recording about it

17:10.053 --> 17:11.721
being a call from
prison will play,

17:11.805 --> 17:14.558
and then you can call
her from your phone,

17:14.641 --> 17:17.144
conference her in,
and I can talk to her.

17:19.605 --> 17:20.730
Please?

17:20.814 --> 17:22.065
Two minute warning.
Two minutes.

17:22.148 --> 17:23.317
(PEOPLE EXCLAIM
IN DISAPPOINTMENT)

17:23.442 --> 17:25.152
What? Jesus, they don't
give you any time.

17:25.277 --> 17:27.904
I know. Honey, have you talked
to your dad about Alex?

17:28.905 --> 17:31.116
No, I... Not yet. I will...

17:31.199 --> 17:32.493
Faster, please. Come on.
Okay, well,

17:32.576 --> 17:34.661
I'll ask him about it when
I see him later this week.

17:34.911 --> 17:36.204
Ask him what?

17:36.580 --> 17:39.458
To look over the indictment. To
see if Alex really named her.

17:39.541 --> 17:41.960
Of course she named me.
It's so obvious.

17:42.043 --> 17:43.753
Then why does his
dad need to check?

17:43.878 --> 17:48.800
So I can shove it in her smug,
lying, fucking lying, fucking face.

17:49.968 --> 17:51.345
I know she's lying.

17:53.347 --> 17:56.433
Hold up. What, she's in
here with you? Oh...

17:58.852 --> 17:59.811
Yes.

17:59.894 --> 18:01.313
Why didn't you tell me?

18:01.396 --> 18:02.523
Oh.

18:02.648 --> 18:06.943
You lied to me?
Honey, I didn't lie to you.

18:07.027 --> 18:10.030
I just failed to mention.
I didn't want you to worry.

18:10.155 --> 18:11.365
Worry? Worry about what?

18:11.490 --> 18:12.699
That she'd turn gay again.

18:13.450 --> 18:16.578
Whoa. That's not happening.
And you don't just turn gay.

18:16.703 --> 18:18.664
You fall somewhere on a spectrum.
Like, on a Kinsey scale.

18:18.746 --> 18:19.706
Okay.

18:19.831 --> 18:20.874
(STUTTERS)

18:20.957 --> 18:23.877
Besides, she is the last person
around here that I'd sleep with.

18:24.002 --> 18:25.003
Who's the first?

18:25.086 --> 18:26.087
See? I didn't mean that.

18:26.213 --> 18:27.714
I didn't mean that. I just...

18:27.797 --> 18:29.216
This is exactly why I
didn't want to tell you.

18:29.299 --> 18:32.010
Because I knew that you would do this.
What are you afraid of?

18:32.093 --> 18:34.471
That I'm going to do something?

18:34.555 --> 18:35.681
Gay?

18:35.763 --> 18:38.433
I wasn't before,
until you lied. Now I'm...

18:38.559 --> 18:40.768
Now I'm wondering if maybe
you're worried you will.

18:40.894 --> 18:42.521
Ah. Classic projection.

18:42.604 --> 18:43.730
Polly, don't help.

is the ceiling ripped open.

But, surprise, surprise, our
electrical line has been compromised.

19:40.704 --> 19:42.956
We have to run new electrical.

19:44.416 --> 19:48.670
Officer Luschek,
is running new electrical

19:48.795 --> 19:51.298
something that you
feel particularly

19:51.423 --> 19:53.883
excited about doing
on a fucking Monday?

19:53.967 --> 19:54.968
Nope.

19:55.051 --> 19:56.052
Hell nope.

19:57.178 --> 20:00.599
You ought to be relaxing
after an exhausting weekend of

20:00.682 --> 20:03.477
prostate stimulation
and blow-up fuck dolls.

20:05.479 --> 20:06.896
But instead,

20:07.855 --> 20:12.986
thanks to this missed
opportunity for cradle death,

20:14.154 --> 20:15.947
you're here with me.

20:17.282 --> 20:19.409
And all these
other shit-birds.

20:22.912 --> 20:25.915
And all this shit.

20:28.335 --> 20:30.420

SHU just for talking.

20:30.504 --> 20:31.879
Quiet, or you'll go with her.

20:32.255 --> 20:35.133
It weren't my fault. I was just
doing as the Spirit commanded.

20:35.216 --> 20:36.718
Fuck are you, Joan of Arc?

20:37.803 --> 20:40.472
No. I'm from Waynesboro.

and go start the demo.

Excuse me.

20:50.649 --> 20:51.858
Yes?

20:52.609 --> 20:53.943
Could we get some masks?

20:54.027 --> 20:55.111
(LAUGHS)

20:55.195 --> 20:58.365
For the mold.
And the rat shit dust.

21:06.832 --> 21:08.041
Bennett, go see if you can find

21:08.166 --> 21:09.835
some dust masks
in the tool shed.

21:09.959 --> 21:11.294
Okay.

21:11.378 --> 21:15.173

bringing in those sheets of drywall.

21:23.849 --> 21:25.517
That's why this

abomination in the church,

21:28.228 --> 21:29.468

get rid of "it,"

keep on happening.

You are not
an agent of God, okay?

21:36.403 --> 21:40.407
God can do so much better than you.
You must know that, right?

21:40.532 --> 21:41.491
Know what?

21:41.575 --> 21:44.703
Jesus Christ, how the fuck
did you survive infancy?

(SNIFFING)

22:57.901 --> 23:01.738
Hey. I thought that
we might get masks, too?

23:03.239 --> 23:04.990
There's not enough.

23:06.785 --> 23:08.453
That's what you get
for acting uppity.

23:08.536 --> 23:10.956
Okay, so about the chicken...

23:11.581 --> 23:13.834
What about it? It's like Red's
version of the white whale.

23:13.959 --> 23:16.001
No, no, no, I saw it.
I really did.

23:16.127 --> 23:18.839
All right. It's just you
and the crackheads then.

23:18.922 --> 23:21.299
But at least you're getting
in good with Captain Ahab.

23:21.382 --> 23:23.384
Better her ship than the ocean.

23:24.511 --> 23:27.722

come look for it after work?

23:27.848 --> 23:29.182
What, the chicken?

23:29.265 --> 23:33.060
We're gonna search the yard.
Morello invited me.

23:34.980 --> 23:37.774
Morello and I are sort of
taking a break. (SNIFFS)

23:38.023 --> 23:40.025
I'm sorry to hear that.
What happened?

23:40.109 --> 23:44.823
Yeah, she still thinks her relationship
with her fiance isn't doomed.

23:45.323 --> 23:47.241
But she'll be back.

Twenty.

23:59.044 --> 24:00.244
You got that?
What's the score?

24:00.296 --> 24:01.339
Oh.

24:01.589 --> 24:02.799
Hold up, let me add it up.

the chicken again.

That bitch is crazy.

24:13.184 --> 24:15.060
Who gives a shit
about a chicken?

24:15.144 --> 24:17.345
Maybe it's not the chicken but
what's within the chicken.

24:18.105 --> 24:19.440
You trying to sound deep?

24:19.858 --> 24:23.778
Nah. My boy, Potato Chip, told
me that when he was down,

24:23.904 --> 24:27.991
they used to bring in dope by
putting that shit inside birds.

24:28.616 --> 24:30.159
Chickens?
Nah.

24:30.243 --> 24:31.745
I think it was like
a pigeon or something.

24:31.870 --> 24:33.120
Did they stick it up the butt?

24:33.246 --> 24:37.166
Nah. They put it in a little
baggie, stuff it down the throat.

24:37.625 --> 24:39.335
But maybe they put
it in the butt, too.

24:39.920 --> 24:41.086
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

24:41.170 --> 24:44.257
There's no chicken.
That's a fairy tale.

24:44.340 --> 24:45.800
(ALL CHUCKLE)

24:48.344 --> 24:50.972

worth, like, $1,000, yo.

FLACA: And that's just from
what they put inside a pigeon.

24:55.226 --> 24:57.687
A chicken's got
a much bigger butt.

25:01.148 --> 25:02.609
Are you kidding me?

25:04.277 --> 25:05.278

25:05.445 --> 25:08.489
You have to be fucking kidding me.
You too?

25:08.615 --> 25:11.367
I'm not stupid. I'm just
going to watch the stupid.

25:13.954 --> 25:16.497
Yo, Spanish mamis
got something going on.

barbecue sauce on my titties,

31:07.640 --> 31:10.310
and I'm like,
"What the fuck? Again?"

31:11.978 --> 31:13.438
And then I look down

31:16.649 --> 31:21.737
and I see there's this dude
down on the ground

31:21.821 --> 31:23.530
with his head by,
like, the tire.

31:24.449 --> 31:25.783
And then I look close

31:25.866 --> 31:27.910
and I recognize it's the
bum from the night before

31:27.994 --> 31:30.663

outside of Pizzeria Uno.

all over his face and he's...

is happening right now.

Not that you're not all great, but I
guess I just thought I'd never be here.

32:29.889 --> 32:34.727
You know, I thought I was
someone who was in control.

32:35.269 --> 32:37.313
And I was in control,
for a while.

32:38.189 --> 32:40.274
When I only dealt heroin.

32:40.400 --> 32:43.569
Not even dealt.
I mean, I was an importer.

32:46.906 --> 32:51.618
But, yeah, I was going through
a break-up, and it was around.

32:53.162 --> 32:55.706
Actually, I think it's more accurate
to say that I was abandoned.

32:56.749 --> 33:01.212
But, anyway, I started using.

33:01.295 --> 33:02.922

made me feel better,

33:13.433 --> 33:15.642
and she was always available.

33:17.937 --> 33:20.017

will fuck you over, you know?

know, wouldn't you?

was supposed to relax you.

but if you put up the plastic,

you'll save a lot
of money on heating.

take care of us when we're dying.

any projects you're working on?

an article right now.

It's a trend piece, about
something called edging.

It's when you have sex or
masturbate without coming.

34:28.007 --> 34:30.635
Without coming?
That sounds unhealthy.

34:30.717 --> 34:33.094
A man needs to come.
Larry, tell me you're coming.

34:33.179 --> 34:34.221
I shouldn't have said anything.

34:34.347 --> 34:37.850
Howard, tell Larry he needs to come.
You could get blocked up!

34:37.975 --> 34:39.059
I'll tell him.

The girl made soup.

34:42.980 --> 34:44.773
Soup would be nice.
I'm fine. Thank you.

34:44.857 --> 34:46.859
I'll get for both of you.

34:50.655 --> 34:54.324
Dad, please. I know you don't like
Piper, but I'm asking you to help me.

34:54.408 --> 34:55.534
Who said I don't like her?

34:55.618 --> 34:56.994
I like her. She's the nicest
felon you've ever dated.

34:57.077 --> 34:58.287
Stop.

34:58.871 --> 35:01.374
I just think she's a bit wispy.

35:01.499 --> 35:03.209

someone more substantial.

character or the size of her breasts?

the indictment.

It's good that
Piper'll know for sure.

35:33.989 --> 35:37.368
And she'll hate her more,
so she'll stay away from her.

35:38.244 --> 35:40.246
Listen, Larry, don't tell her.
Why?

35:41.455 --> 35:42.665
Prison is a fishbowl, son.

35:42.748 --> 35:44.625
The last thing she needs
is an enemy to obsess over,

35:44.750 --> 35:46.293
do something
stupid out of anger.

35:46.419 --> 35:49.088
She should serve her time
and leave without any trouble.

35:49.922 --> 35:51.298
I'm not gonna lie
to my fiancee.

35:51.424 --> 35:52.425
Why not?

35:52.550 --> 35:54.677
Because our relationship
doesn't work that way.

35:54.760 --> 35:58.598
Oh, yes, yes. It's based
on trust and honesty.

35:58.681 --> 36:00.266
Even though she
neglected to tell you

36:00.391 --> 36:02.351
that she's in there
with this Alex until now?

36:02.435 --> 36:05.187
Okay, first of all,
it's only been three weeks,

36:05.271 --> 36:08.982
and she didn't want to tell me because
she didn't want me to get upset.

36:09.108 --> 36:10.610
So, why should you upset her?

36:13.320 --> 36:14.572
No. (SCOFFS)

36:15.364 --> 36:17.533
No. I'm not gonna
lie to protect her

36:17.617 --> 36:19.785
like she's some
helpless thing, okay?

36:20.661 --> 36:23.122
Honesty is the best policy.
I really believe that.

36:24.665 --> 36:27.334
Larry, remember
all those special

36:27.460 --> 36:30.087
achievement ribbons
you earned as a child?

36:31.130 --> 36:32.298
Yeah.

36:32.381 --> 36:34.800
You notice how there was
never a public ceremony?

36:34.925 --> 36:38.137
You did win that one for
tidiest cubby in preschool.

36:38.262 --> 36:40.306

go through with it.

36:57.531 --> 37:01.702
Here, Larry. Eat your soup. You're
the best soup eater in America.

37:08.208 --> 37:09.710

37:14.381 --> 37:16.008
Here, chicky, chicky, chicky.

37:18.135 --> 37:19.845
What's going on?

37:20.179 --> 37:23.849
There's $1,000 inside a chicken somewhere.
Everyone's looking for it.

37:24.600 --> 37:26.602
What?
RED: You.

37:27.853 --> 37:29.563
This is your fault.
Huh?

37:29.689 --> 37:32.358
You've been blabbing all over
about the chicken, haven't you?

37:32.525 --> 37:33.859
Not really.

37:34.360 --> 37:36.737
But even if I had, you never
told me it was a secret.

37:36.862 --> 37:38.989
Because I thought
you had common sense.

37:39.072 --> 37:41.867
Black girls hear about a chicken,
of course this will happen.

37:42.075 --> 37:43.910
Why, because all
black people love chicken?

37:44.036 --> 37:45.287
Don't be racist.

37:45.371 --> 37:46.664
Because they're all on heroin,

37:46.747 --> 37:49.792
and somebody's been telling them
there's heroin in the chicken.

37:49.875 --> 37:51.043
I heard it's a gun.

37:51.126 --> 37:53.045
Okay, I had nothing
to do with this.

37:53.128 --> 37:55.840
You cannot blame this on me.
I just told you what I saw.

37:55.922 --> 37:57.717
Right, what you "saw."

37:57.842 --> 38:00.427
Why are you using air quotes?
Are you saying that I'm lying?

38:00.553 --> 38:02.137
Maybe you wanted
to impress people.

38:02.221 --> 38:04.557
I did not even know this was
a thing that was impressive.

38:04.682 --> 38:08.143
If she hasn't been scared off, the
Spanish or the blacks have her.

38:08.268 --> 38:10.813
Those Spanish probably
won't even eat her,

38:10.896 --> 38:12.981
just cut her throat
and drink her blood,

38:13.065 --> 38:15.150
or something
else superstitious.

38:15.609 --> 38:17.319
All I wanted was
to eat the chicken

38:17.403 --> 38:19.071
that is smarter
than other chickens

38:19.196 --> 38:20.947

But, oh, well.

38:28.163 --> 38:31.083

You're just gonna give up?

38:33.252 --> 38:34.294
Huh?

38:35.462 --> 38:37.256
Just because of
a little competition?

38:38.758 --> 38:40.217

38:40.300 --> 38:42.969

To eat it.

And you have been waiting for
a very long time to eat it.

38:48.058 --> 38:50.436
What do those other girls
have that you don't have?

38:50.519 --> 38:51.604
They have dogs.

38:51.729 --> 38:54.899
Dogs does not a chicken catch.

chicken the most?

39:03.449 --> 39:06.577
Who will prepare
that chicken most expertly?

39:07.620 --> 39:10.122
The woman who dreams about it.

39:10.790 --> 39:14.126
The woman who was born
to eat that chicken.

was a chicken in my yard?

49:12.349 --> 49:14.393
(SIGHS) Where's your
stupid paper airplane?

49:14.518 --> 49:15.601
At home.

49:15.727 --> 49:16.936
Well, then why do I care?

49:17.062 --> 49:19.823
You want to show me something? You
can't show me something I can't see!

49:20.732 --> 49:21.816
What are you, stupid?

49:24.986 --> 49:28.198
You tell that motherfucker
he better visit. He owes me.

49:28.281 --> 49:31.076
WOMAN OVER PA: When in the visitation
room, you're allowed two hugs.

49:31.617 --> 49:34.079
One on arrival,
and one on departure.

49:40.085 --> 49:41.378
Good, you're home.

49:43.004 --> 49:45.673
Won't you make us
something to eat?

49:53.723 --> 49:55.350
Take off. Be out.

49:59.020 --> 50:01.398
How your tits be so big,
your mom's so small, huh?

50:01.481 --> 50:02.690
Well, I guess I
get 'em from my dad.

50:02.774 --> 50:03.983
Yeah?

50:18.582 --> 50:19.958
You said five minutes.

50:20.041 --> 50:22.210
Please. I just need
five more minutes.

50:22.335 --> 50:25.880
That's all. This is a very
important phone call.

50:25.964 --> 50:29.008
I'm on hold. (WHISPERING)
It's about my company.

50:29.134 --> 50:31.635
Man, I doubt you even got a company.
You all talk.

50:31.970 --> 50:33.305
See, there you go.

50:33.430 --> 50:34.847
POLLY: Piper?
Are you still there?

50:34.973 --> 50:36.308
Yes, I'm right here.
What's going on?

50:36.391 --> 50:37.591
I'm in a conference with Weiner

50:37.641 --> 50:39.242
on the other line.
How do I punch you in?

50:39.978 --> 50:41.354
I don't know, it's your phone.

50:41.480 --> 50:43.731
Ugh. All right, hold on. I have to ask Pete.
I'll be right back.

50:43.815 --> 50:45.024
No, no, no! Polly, wait, I don't...
Pete!

50:45.150 --> 50:47.235
Polly, Polly, Polly...

50:47.360 --> 50:48.987
MAN OVER PA:
Please revise count.

50:49.112 --> 50:51.573
It is not clear.
Please conduct a recount.

50:59.581 --> 51:00.624
Oh.

51:03.543 --> 51:05.504
Hey. Hey!

51:05.587 --> 51:07.380
Hey! Hey! Hey!

51:07.506 --> 51:08.706
Hey! Get off, man!
There it is!

51:08.756 --> 51:10.674
Look!
There it is! There's the...

51:10.800 --> 51:13.512
Hey! Hey! Are you
using the phone?

51:13.637 --> 51:14.638
Yes! I'm on hold.

51:14.720 --> 51:17.974
Hey! Hey! Make your call
or free up the phone now.

51:23.271 --> 51:24.856
Okay, Piper?
I figured it out.

51:24.939 --> 51:27.140
Everyone's on the other line.
I'm punching you in, okay?

51:27.859 --> 51:31.112
Piper? Piper, are you there?

51:31.279 --> 51:33.448
Dandelion ain't here right now.

51:33.532 --> 51:35.074
She gone to chase the chicken.

51:40.038 --> 51:41.206
(CLUCKING)

51:42.790 --> 51:44.042
PORNSTACHE: Chapman!

51:45.751 --> 51:47.552
What did I tell you
about running in the yard?

51:47.587 --> 51:48.880
I'm sorry, sir.
It's just that...

51:49.005 --> 51:50.507
Both feet on the ground
at all times. What?

51:50.590 --> 51:53.677
Nothing. Just trying to get
some fitness, that's all.

51:53.759 --> 51:56.429
Two speeds in my yard.
Walk and shuffle.

52:12.696 --> 52:14.030
(CLUCKING)
