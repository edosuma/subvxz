00:11.470 --> 00:13.846
Let's end today's lesson
by levitating Chopper.

00:13.931 --> 00:15.264
lf I do, can I drop him?

00:17.935 --> 00:18.935
Sure.

00:23.649 --> 00:25.400
Chalk another one up for the clone.

00:27.569 --> 00:30.279
Takes more than brawn
to win this game, big guy.

00:31.407 --> 00:34.117
Maybe I let you win, old guy.

00:36.412 --> 00:37.453
Lock it down.

00:41.500 --> 00:44.293
Come on, Ezra. Focus.

00:45.921 --> 00:51.008
Focus. Use the Force.
Look through the Force.

00:51.093 --> 00:54.470
Lift Chopper up. Picture it in your mind.

00:59.977 --> 01:02.645
I can't! I can't do it.

01:02.813 --> 01:04.939
Hey, kid, while you're
looking through the Force,

01:05.023 --> 01:07.316
don't forget to look with your eyes too.

01:07.943 --> 01:09.652
The droid's got his feet locked down.

01:12.823 --> 01:14.073
It's not fair.

01:14.158 --> 01:15.867
Real battles usually aren't.

01:15.951 --> 01:20.496
The Jedi general I served
combined the Force with his wits,

01:20.581 --> 01:22.832
and it made him a great warrior.

01:23.208 --> 01:26.878
Ezra's got plenty of wits.
What he needs is more discipline.

01:27.045 --> 01:30.590
Well, then you
better let a soldier handle that.

01:30.841 --> 01:31.883
Excuse me?

01:32.176 --> 01:34.510
Sabine, I have a mission
for you and Chop.

01:34.595 --> 01:36.387
Thanks to Captain Rex,
I found an old base

01:36.472 --> 01:39.599
where we might be able to salvage
some much-needed medical supplies.

01:39.683 --> 01:41.601
Zeb, you should go too.

01:42.728 --> 01:45.980
Better find the med supplies quick.
Captain Wits is about to need them.

01:47.524 --> 01:50.568
So there's where the boy's lack
of discipline comes from.

01:50.819 --> 01:52.612
You're saying I lack discipline?

01:52.696 --> 01:55.072
Yeah, that's exactly what I said.

01:55.491 --> 01:56.574
Here we go again.

01:57.534 --> 02:00.828
Funny. But a soldier's
discipline can't compare to a Jedi's.

02:00.913 --> 02:03.498
It takes far more discipline not to fight.

02:03.582 --> 02:08.544
So you're just gonna ask the Empire
to lay down their weapons and give up.

02:08.629 --> 02:10.588
No, that isn't what I meant.

02:10.672 --> 02:13.674
What I meant is Ezra's
got to learn to stay in the moment,

02:14.092 --> 02:16.052
be present. You got it, Ezra?

02:16.136 --> 02:17.136
Ezra.

02:17.221 --> 02:19.055
Hey, you weren't assigned this mission.

02:19.223 --> 02:22.391
I assigned myself. I'd rather deal
with the dangers out there,

02:22.476 --> 02:24.185
than stay in the cross fire in here.

02:24.269 --> 02:25.895
You say that now.

02:51.046 --> 02:52.296
What is this place?

02:52.381 --> 02:55.800
It's an old Republic medical station
abandoned after the Clone Wars.

03:09.773 --> 03:12.024
What do you know?
Rex's codes worked.

03:27.791 --> 03:30.501
Come on, Chop. It's not so creepy.

03:30.586 --> 03:33.921
Just dark. Nothing we can't handle.

03:34.006 --> 03:38.217
Wait. You actually understand that
glorified beeping garbage can?

03:38.302 --> 03:41.470
Yeah. Sort of. I'm learning.

03:49.354 --> 03:52.106
Yep. I was afraid of this. No power.

03:52.316 --> 03:53.524
I'm on it.

04:23.138 --> 04:24.639
Sabine, hurry up.

04:36.526 --> 04:37.610
Hey.

04:38.236 --> 04:39.278
Ezra!

04:48.205 --> 04:49.705
I will be right there.

04:50.332 --> 04:53.876
Well, this is the command center.
Or what's left of it.

04:55.712 --> 04:57.213
This might make a good base for us.

04:58.507 --> 04:59.799
No, thanks.

04:59.883 --> 05:02.176
This place looks like
it's about to fall apart.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.427
Chopper!

05:05.138 --> 05:06.389
Power it up.

05:12.980 --> 05:15.815
I didn't mean the whole station.
I meant this control panel.

05:22.114 --> 05:24.281
These mystics are unnecessary.

05:24.366 --> 05:27.660
I don't know why Lord Vader
insists on sending them.

05:27.744 --> 05:30.204
Agent Kallus, I may have something.

05:30.288 --> 05:34.291
A power surge at a decommissioned
medical station in Sector 11.

05:34.376 --> 05:35.334
Could be Rebels.

05:35.419 --> 05:36.502
Could be anything.

05:36.586 --> 05:38.671
A malfunction or even scavengers.

05:38.755 --> 05:42.800
No. I sense those we seek.

05:42.884 --> 05:46.846
One of your disturbances, I assume.

05:46.930 --> 05:50.599
Very well. Admiral,
set a course for this medical station.

05:50.809 --> 05:55.354
Your assistance is unnecessary,
Agent Kallus. I shall go alone.

06:04.406 --> 06:08.200
Okay, Chopper, shut everything else
off except for this one terminal.

06:11.788 --> 06:15.666
Got the inventory files,
but most are corrupted, unreadable.

06:16.251 --> 06:19.295
I can't tell where the med supplies
are or if they even exist.

06:19.421 --> 06:22.715
So, change of plans then.
Chopper stays here, repairs the files,

06:22.883 --> 06:24.467
while we search for the supplies.

06:24.634 --> 06:26.635
Well, it's worth a try, I guess.

06:32.976 --> 06:36.687
Why don't you put those Jedi powers to
use finding the medical supplies

06:36.772 --> 06:38.064
so we can get out of here?

06:38.148 --> 06:40.066
No. It doesn't work like that, Zeb.

06:40.150 --> 06:43.235
But I don't need my
Jedi powers to find them before you do.

06:44.154 --> 06:45.654
What's that supposed to mean?

06:46.156 --> 06:48.240
Well, generally it means
I'm more perceptive,

06:48.325 --> 06:50.493
I can think on my feet, and I'm faster.

06:51.411 --> 06:52.787
Really?

06:52.871 --> 06:56.582
Look, I don't care which one of you finds
them first, as long as you find them.

06:56.666 --> 06:58.834
I'll find them first.

06:59.377 --> 07:02.338
Cocky kid. Gonna run right past him.

07:11.348 --> 07:12.556
So not fair.

07:13.475 --> 07:17.520
Fights rarely are. Next time, keep your
head down and you won't get hit.

07:21.691 --> 07:23.275
You were saying?

08:32.470 --> 08:33.679
It's Chopper.

08:34.055 --> 08:36.015
Say again. You need help?

08:36.266 --> 08:37.808
-What's going on?
-I don't know.

08:37.893 --> 08:39.685
It sounded like Chopper said
he needed help.

08:39.769 --> 08:41.854
Well, better get back up
to the command center.

08:42.147 --> 08:43.397
How about a shortcut?

08:46.943 --> 08:49.069
Can't we go back the way we came?

08:49.154 --> 08:51.572
That'll take too long.
Chopper's in trouble.

08:56.369 --> 08:59.997
Hey, wait! Wait!
Okay, that's uncomfortable.

09:02.417 --> 09:03.417
Chopper!

09:09.507 --> 09:10.799
Chopper, where are you?

09:13.094 --> 09:14.345
Chopper?

09:16.514 --> 09:17.973
What is that?

09:18.058 --> 09:20.809
It looks like a probe droid.

09:22.854 --> 09:24.897
My pet told me you were here.

09:24.981 --> 09:27.775
I've been searching for you
for some time.

09:28.109 --> 09:29.526
A bounty hunter?

09:29.736 --> 09:31.487
Guess again.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.245
You're an Inquisitor.

09:39.329 --> 09:42.998
Good. I won't have to explain it to you.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.167
So, you know what comes next.

09:45.794 --> 09:46.835
Run!

10:00.433 --> 10:02.559
Like Kanan said, it's never a fair fight.

10:11.194 --> 10:12.903
We need to find Zeb and Chopper.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.488
Yeah, that way.

10:21.913 --> 10:23.330
Not who we're looking for.

10:23.540 --> 10:24.832
How many of these guys are there?

10:24.916 --> 10:26.041
Two!

10:40.223 --> 10:42.599
Go, go! Go, go!

10:49.316 --> 10:50.316
No!

10:51.234 --> 10:53.277
Sabine, run!

10:54.988 --> 10:56.030
Ezra!

10:57.782 --> 11:01.243
Such a noble act. Just like a Jedi.

11:01.703 --> 11:03.120
I'm learning.

11:04.414 --> 11:05.831
But not quite enough.

11:08.418 --> 11:10.002
I'm surprised to see you here.

11:10.211 --> 11:11.795
The kill is mine.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.922
You are short-sighted.

11:14.090 --> 11:16.425
We will use the boy as bait
to draw in the others.

11:16.593 --> 11:18.218
-Now find the girl.
-No!

11:28.563 --> 11:30.356
You and I are gonna have a talk.

11:30.440 --> 11:33.609
And if you're good,
maybe some of your friends will survive.

11:35.653 --> 11:36.779
Zeb!

11:40.992 --> 11:42.117
Zeb!

11:42.452 --> 11:46.246
I don't wanna die this way.
I'm the last of my kind.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.795
What's going on? I heard blasts.

11:53.296 --> 11:54.546
They've got Ezra.

11:54.631 --> 11:57.341
-Who's got Ezra?
-Inquisitors. Two of them.

11:58.093 --> 12:01.053
One was bad enough.
We need to get Kanan.

12:01.137 --> 12:04.223
No. lf we send a signal,
we could compromise the fleet.

12:04.307 --> 12:06.183
We have to try
and save Ezra ourselves.

12:06.267 --> 12:07.810
How are we supposed to do that?

12:07.894 --> 12:09.478
I'm working on it.

12:15.652 --> 12:17.736
You handle a lightsaber well,
apprentice.

12:18.321 --> 12:21.615
Well, I've got some time,
if you wanted a lesson.

12:23.785 --> 12:27.079
You have great potential,
but perhaps it is I that might teach you,

12:27.163 --> 12:31.208
as your master never achieved
the rank of Jedi Knight. Did he?

12:31.376 --> 12:34.169
Maybe not,
but he took out the last Inquisitor.

12:34.671 --> 12:36.630
So I think I'll just stick with him.

12:36.714 --> 12:40.926
Yes, the death of the Grand Inquisitor
was a surprise to all.

12:41.010 --> 12:45.222
Yet, it does present
the rest of us with new opportunities.

12:45.306 --> 12:50.310
There are many hunting you now,
all intent on killing you and your master.

12:50.395 --> 12:51.687
Does that frighten you?

12:52.021 --> 12:54.356
lf you were gonna kill me,
you'd have already done it.

12:55.608 --> 12:58.026
Kill you? I have no plans to kill you.

12:59.529 --> 13:00.529
Yet.

13:19.466 --> 13:21.884
Your fear betrays you.

13:32.520 --> 13:33.562
Come on.

13:35.440 --> 13:36.482
It's not working!

13:40.904 --> 13:41.945
Run!

13:59.172 --> 14:02.257
The other is yours. Do as you will.

14:40.463 --> 14:42.548
Now I find the supplies.

14:49.180 --> 14:51.848
Why can you just not cooperate?

14:52.642 --> 14:55.477
Why do you compel me to inflict pain?

14:57.772 --> 15:01.525
You know we'll find the others,
so why not just tell me where they are?

15:01.901 --> 15:07.030
Because unlike you, I can shut up.
You're like a broken protocol droid.

15:10.201 --> 15:11.743
You hide your fear well.

15:12.245 --> 15:15.872
Poor child. lf only you had the power
to protect your friends.

15:15.957 --> 15:19.835
Shows what you know.
I'm growing more powerful every day.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.254
Unfortunate there's no one
left to train you.

15:22.630 --> 15:24.006
The Jedi of old are dead.

15:24.173 --> 15:25.424
Not all of 'em.

15:25.883 --> 15:27.175
We know about Ahsoka Tano.

15:27.635 --> 15:29.803
Who's Ahsoka Tano?

15:29.887 --> 15:31.513
As pretty as you are...

15:31.723 --> 15:32.848
What?

15:32.932 --> 15:36.685
I only need you alive.
That doesn't mean in one piece.

15:36.978 --> 15:39.521
Now, where's Ahsoka Tano?

15:44.902 --> 15:47.779
Chopper! What'd they do to you?

15:57.123 --> 15:59.041
You know I don't understand
what you're saying.

16:00.335 --> 16:02.628
Just come with me. I need your help.

16:04.213 --> 16:05.839
Will you just be quiet?

16:06.758 --> 16:08.008
I need your help.

16:17.185 --> 16:18.852
What has the boy revealed?

16:18.936 --> 16:20.604
Nothing I wish to share.

16:20.688 --> 16:24.566
Contact your rebel friends
and bring them here. That's all I ask.

16:24.651 --> 16:27.569
Let me think about that. No.

16:27.904 --> 16:30.322
Contact your friends.

16:30.657 --> 16:34.159
I'm not talking to you right now.
Sabine, where's Zeb?

16:34.327 --> 16:37.037
We tried to fight,
but Zeb never had a chance.

16:37.121 --> 16:40.082
-What are you saying?
-Your friend is dead.

16:42.460 --> 16:44.294
You are mocking me, right?

16:45.880 --> 16:47.047
I can never tell.

16:47.423 --> 16:50.676
Everyone seems to know
everything these days.

16:50.760 --> 16:55.639
Truth is, I don't really stand a chance
going in alone, much less with you.

16:57.684 --> 17:01.645
lf we leave this space station,
we will never see those kids again.

17:01.729 --> 17:04.898
I came here with them,
and I'm not leaving without them.

17:06.442 --> 17:09.444
Hello, Spectre-6, come in.

17:09.529 --> 17:12.364
Do you read?
This is Commander Meiloorun.

17:13.324 --> 17:14.449
Answer him.

17:15.243 --> 17:18.286
Commander Meiloorun.
Yes. Yes, I can hear you.

17:18.371 --> 17:19.830
You missed your check-in.

17:19.914 --> 17:21.206
Am I correct in assuming

17:21.290 --> 17:23.917
mechanical difficulties
have your craft stranded again,

17:24.001 --> 17:26.545
and you're in need of help
with repairs?

17:26.796 --> 17:27.796
Answer him.

17:28.089 --> 17:30.716
Commander, we...
We can handle everything.

17:30.800 --> 17:32.384
No need for you or the others.

17:35.930 --> 17:38.348
No, Commander.
We changed our mind.

17:38.433 --> 17:39.808
We could use some help.

17:39.892 --> 17:43.478
Bring Kanan,
and you better bring Ahsoka too.

17:44.647 --> 17:46.982
Very well. Meet you in Bay Six.

17:47.316 --> 17:49.735
And don't worry. We'll fix everything.

17:50.319 --> 17:54.156
Just keep your chin up
and it'll all be fine.

17:57.493 --> 18:00.036
Once we have the others,
we'll dispose of them both.

18:01.122 --> 18:02.497
Very slowly.

18:15.011 --> 18:18.930
Chin up. Chin up?
What does that mean?

18:22.310 --> 18:23.477
What?

18:37.450 --> 18:38.492
Go!

19:11.818 --> 19:13.360
The doors are closing!

19:16.155 --> 19:17.739
I can't hold them alone!

19:22.954 --> 19:23.995
Go, go! Go, go, go!

19:32.713 --> 19:34.756
We made it. Good plan, Zeb.

19:35.049 --> 19:38.343
Let's not get all emotional.
It wasn't a big deal.

19:38.427 --> 19:42.514
But I did save both of you and got
some medical supplies by myself.

19:44.100 --> 19:46.142
Yeah, you helped a little, Chopper.

20:00.032 --> 20:01.032
I win.

20:02.159 --> 20:04.995
Looks like you can be disciplined
when you set your mind to it.

20:05.079 --> 20:07.455
What? Wait. Are you trying to say
you're teaching me a lesson?

20:07.623 --> 20:09.791
There are many ways to find victory.

20:10.167 --> 20:12.586
I'm not sure if I like
you more or less now.

20:13.337 --> 20:15.005
Speaking of lack of discipline.

20:15.381 --> 20:17.507
Ezra, we need to talk.

20:17.592 --> 20:20.468
Yeah, we do, about
the two Inquisitors we just ran into.

20:20.678 --> 20:21.720
Inquisitors?

20:22.597 --> 20:26.141
Yes. Two. We got lucky. Zeb saved us.

20:26.309 --> 20:28.768
Without him,
things could have been bad.

20:29.353 --> 20:30.562
Well done, soldier.

20:30.980 --> 20:35.483
It was a group effort.
Those Inquisitors are nasty business.

20:36.360 --> 20:38.987
Kanan, why didn't
you tell us there were more of 'em?

20:44.785 --> 20:47.662
Commander Sato
is going to need a full report on this.

20:47.955 --> 20:51.207
Well, we did get the medical supplies.
Some of them.

20:51.542 --> 20:52.751
Well, that's good news.

20:52.835 --> 20:54.836
I'll meet you three
on the command deck.

20:59.008 --> 21:01.509
Kanan, they knew about Ahsoka.

21:01.636 --> 21:02.677
I'll tell her.

21:05.514 --> 21:07.223
Did you know there was more than one?

21:09.727 --> 21:12.354
No, I didn't.
Do you think Ahsoka knows?

21:12.980 --> 21:14.230
I honestly don't know.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.610
We really have no idea
what we're up against.
