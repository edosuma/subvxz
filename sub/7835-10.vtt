00:56.807 --> 00:59.225
Dream

00:59.309 --> 01:01.644
Dream, dream, dream

01:01.729 --> 01:03.563
Dream

01:03.647 --> 01:06.441
Ooh, Jar Jar, everyone hates you but me.

01:08.986 --> 01:11.946
In my arms when I want you

01:50.319 --> 01:52.361
Cool! Mom's on drugs.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.822
If we turn her in, we can get
a form letter from Dick Cheney.

01:54.907 --> 01:56.949
She's not on drugs. She couldn't sleep

01:57.034 --> 01:58.993
because of Dad's chronic snoring.

01:59.077 --> 02:01.996
I'm taking him to Dr.
Hibbert's this afternoon.

02:02.080 --> 02:05.875
You know how hard it is to get
a doctor on Wednesday morning.

02:10.422 --> 02:11.547
Yah!

02:14.551 --> 02:15.968
I haven't lost so much sleep

02:16.053 --> 02:18.262
since little Bartie had the scoots.

02:18.347 --> 02:21.641
Well, there's a surgical
option, but it's not cheap.

02:22.226 --> 02:24.060
Here's what it costs.

02:24.520 --> 02:27.104
Interesting. Here's my counteroffer.

02:31.777 --> 02:33.027
Get out.

02:58.971 --> 03:00.346
I'll get it!

03:07.521 --> 03:09.063
Pedals, people!

03:11.275 --> 03:13.943
So Lisa, do you have a
date for the harvest dance?

03:14.027 --> 03:15.653
This is not a good time!

03:15.737 --> 03:17.697
It's never a good time!

03:21.410 --> 03:25.955
Overnight bag, no husband
in sight! It's happened!

03:26.456 --> 03:29.083
She left Homer? I'll get the Champale.

03:29.167 --> 03:31.002
And let's get that ring off.

03:31.587 --> 03:34.255
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Delilah.

03:34.339 --> 03:36.632
I didn't leave Homer, and I never will.

03:37.301 --> 03:40.219
I just need one night
away from his snoring.

03:42.848 --> 03:45.224
Great. We'll have a girls night.

03:45.309 --> 03:46.475
No bras!

03:53.775 --> 03:56.861
Let's catch the tail
end of Nooky in New York.

03:57.154 --> 03:58.529
Nooky in New York?

03:58.614 --> 04:03.576
It's a cable show about four
single women who act like gay men.

04:03.702 --> 04:05.369
That sounds great!

04:08.665 --> 04:11.626
If I'm not having sex by the end
of this goat cheese quesadilla,

04:11.710 --> 04:12.793
I'm gonna scream.

04:12.878 --> 04:14.295
I also enjoy sex.

04:14.755 --> 04:17.505
Since this morning, I've had
sex with a New York Knick,

04:17.591 --> 04:20.384
two subway cops and a guy
who works on Wall Street.

04:20.469 --> 04:21.594
Broker?

04:21.678 --> 04:22.720
Nah, she's just really sore.

04:26.642 --> 04:29.060
This is so like our lives.

04:29.770 --> 04:32.271
It's like they hid a
camera in our apartment.

04:32.356 --> 04:35.232
Coming up next on BHO, it's Arli$$.

04:35.317 --> 04:36.609
Ah!

04:37.194 --> 04:38.653
Gentlemen, start your envy!

04:39.863 --> 04:43.157
Men's World Magazine has listed
the 100 richest men in the country,

04:43.241 --> 04:44.825
and coming in at number five

04:44.910 --> 04:46.827
is Springfield native Artie Ziff.

04:46.912 --> 04:47.954
Ooh.

04:48.038 --> 04:50.289
Whoa! Your old boyfriend.

04:50.374 --> 04:52.375
Please. We went out once.

04:52.834 --> 04:55.795
Artie made mega bucks with
a revolutionary invention,

04:55.879 --> 04:58.756
a converter that changes that horrible
modem noise into easy listening music.

05:02.928 --> 05:05.054
Also available with lyrics.

05:06.431 --> 05:08.349
Hey, computer geek

05:08.433 --> 05:11.227
You will be connected in no time

05:11.395 --> 05:12.687
What a catch.

05:12.771 --> 05:15.356
Why didn't you sink your
claws into him at the prom?

05:15.440 --> 05:17.274
Yeah. He was warm for your form.

05:17.359 --> 05:19.902
Well, he seemed like
a sweet little shrimp.

05:21.571 --> 05:24.073
But then he turned into an octopus.

05:24.324 --> 05:25.533
Artie! Artie, no! Stop!

05:25.617 --> 05:29.078
Marge. Marge, you know you
can't resist my busy hands.

05:29.496 --> 05:31.288
Artie, get off of me!

05:32.958 --> 05:35.126
Well, I think you should
get in touch with him,

05:35.210 --> 05:38.546
you know, just to congratulate
him on his success.

05:40.132 --> 05:43.843
Well, I suppose I could
write him a letter.

05:43.927 --> 05:46.637
Are you nuts? E
- mail, female.

05:48.015 --> 05:49.932
You just tell us what you want to say.

05:51.560 --> 05:54.520
Okay, hold onto your hats.

05:55.814 --> 05:57.023
Dear Artie.

05:57.107 --> 05:58.816
Dear Hottie.

05:59.026 --> 06:02.611
Congratulations on your
recent TV appearance.

06:02.779 --> 06:06.449
I want to sex you up.
Your love slave, Marge.

06:06.783 --> 06:10.161
You can't use the word
"sex" on the Internet.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.620
Watch me!

06:26.178 --> 06:28.804
Anti-trust suit.
Anti-trust suit...

06:30.640 --> 06:32.641
A note from Marge Simpson?

06:32.893 --> 06:35.311
Well, isn't that a coincidence?

06:35.395 --> 06:36.937
I was just thinking about her.

06:37.647 --> 06:40.066
For the last 20 years.

06:49.785 --> 06:51.786
Mom, did you sleep
well at your sisters'?

06:51.870 --> 06:53.245
Mmm-hmm.

06:54.998 --> 06:56.791
Whoo! Mmm.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.042
For you.

06:58.126 --> 06:59.126
Ooh!

06:59.211 --> 07:02.296
Here's to a happy, well-rested Marge.

07:05.133 --> 07:08.302
Hey, a helicopter's landing on our lawn.

07:08.386 --> 07:09.678
Let's approach with caution.

07:15.185 --> 07:18.771
Unguarded breakfasts.
The sweetest taboo.

07:20.982 --> 07:22.691
Ooh.

07:25.403 --> 07:28.114
Well, well, Marge Bouvier.

07:28.198 --> 07:29.406
Artie Ziff?

07:29.991 --> 07:31.200
Oh.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.869
That e-mail. Look, I got a
little drunk and we were...

07:33.954 --> 07:36.288
I'm not surprised you
want me back in your life.

07:36.373 --> 07:38.791
You can't spell party without Artie,

07:38.875 --> 07:41.377
if you misspell party. Or Artie.

07:42.254 --> 07:43.254
How you doing?

07:43.338 --> 07:44.672
Look, it's great to see you,

07:44.756 --> 07:47.383
but you should know I'm happily married.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.385
Married? Was it consummated?

07:49.469 --> 07:50.845
Pretty much, yeah.

07:53.390 --> 07:54.598
What's going on?

07:54.683 --> 07:56.642
Homer, don't talk with your mouth full.

07:56.726 --> 07:58.811
I've told you before, it's rude!

07:58.895 --> 08:01.897
Oh-ho. Trouble in paradise.

08:02.858 --> 08:06.318
Hey, Marge! It's that guy
who couldn't get any off you!

08:06.736 --> 08:09.280
How would you all like
to take a ride with me?

08:09.364 --> 08:10.573
You're the old flame.

08:14.411 --> 08:17.663
Homer, Marge, I have a
rather delicate proposition.

08:17.956 --> 08:19.039
Spill it, moneybags.

08:20.292 --> 08:22.585
Yes, I do have everything,

08:23.086 --> 08:25.921
but yet I often wonder what life
with Marge would've been like.

08:26.006 --> 08:28.507
It's like being married
to my best friend,

08:28.592 --> 08:30.301
and he lets me feel his boobs.

08:31.636 --> 08:32.803
Homie!

08:33.429 --> 08:35.472
Homer, I will give you $1, 000,000

08:35.557 --> 08:37.433
to let me spend a weekend alone

08:37.808 --> 08:39.058
with your wife.

08:40.437 --> 08:43.022
Mmm. A million dollars. Wait a minute.

08:43.231 --> 08:46.692
How much sex would be involved?
Because if it's some...

08:46.943 --> 08:50.362
No, no, no. All I want is to show her

08:50.447 --> 08:53.073
what life would be
like had she chosen me.

08:53.408 --> 08:55.242
Artie, that's a sick idea.

08:55.327 --> 08:56.952
Come on, Homer. We're leaving.

09:02.417 --> 09:04.043
Just think about it!

09:04.127 --> 09:05.669
You'll win her yet, Artie.

09:06.004 --> 09:08.797
I mean, Arr-tie!

09:11.968 --> 09:13.969
Hey, where's our parents?

09:18.308 --> 09:20.226
Hey, Marge, I just thought of something.

09:20.310 --> 09:21.435
What?

09:21.645 --> 09:24.813
If we had Artie's money, I
could get that snoring surgery.

09:24.898 --> 09:28.734
Plus at least two of those other
surgeries I desperately need.

09:29.653 --> 09:33.447
No way, no how. I'll
get used to the snoring.

09:33.615 --> 09:37.159
Just like I got used to saying
"Courteney Cox-Arquette. "

09:37.327 --> 09:41.622
Besides, I like some of
the noises you make in bed.

09:44.584 --> 09:48.003
One squeaking spring symphony coming up.

09:53.510 --> 09:57.513
Wow! Homer, that was amazing!

09:57.597 --> 09:58.931
Yeah, I...

10:09.359 --> 10:11.527
Honey, did you get any sleep?

10:13.238 --> 10:14.989
Oh, I'm so sorry.

10:17.867 --> 10:20.369
Are you snoring while you're awake?

10:20.745 --> 10:22.371
Huh?

10:24.749 --> 10:28.544
You need that surgery.
We'll have to call Artie.

10:29.629 --> 10:33.882
Okay, Ziff. You get her for
the weekend, but no funny stuff.

10:34.342 --> 10:37.177
And by funny stuff,
I mean hand-holding,

10:37.262 --> 10:39.638
goo-goo eyes, misdirected woo,

10:39.723 --> 10:41.974
which is pretty much any John Woo film.

10:42.058 --> 10:43.642
Your wife's virtues shall remain

10:43.727 --> 10:46.478
as untouched as Bill Gates' weight room.

10:49.149 --> 10:53.360
Remember, Homie, I'm doing
this for us. See you on Monday,

11:09.210 --> 11:13.088
This round's on me, Moe!
I got a big payday coming.

11:13.423 --> 11:16.425
Yeah. Homer sold his
wife for a million bucks.

11:16.676 --> 11:21.263
I didn't sell her. I just
rented her to an old boyfriend.

11:21.639 --> 11:23.140
Gee, a million bucks.

11:23.224 --> 11:27.561
That's gonna buy him a lot of
swings in the old batting cage.

11:28.897 --> 11:30.606
Looks like everyone's a winner.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.608
Marge gets a great new life...

11:32.776 --> 11:35.486
And you get more
sprawl space on the bed.

11:35.612 --> 11:38.781
Wait. You really think Marge
is gonna fall for this guy?

11:38.865 --> 11:41.200
Even after I bought her
that hockey fight tape?

11:41.284 --> 11:43.202
I'd dump your ass. Me, too.

11:43.286 --> 11:45.037
Yeah, I can't get Artie out of my head.

11:45.121 --> 11:47.206
He's like a spy in the house of Moe.

11:47.290 --> 11:51.293
Oh, God, you're right. I gotta
get her back before it's too late!

12:00.553 --> 12:01.762
Hello, Artie.

12:02.847 --> 12:04.515
Where are you taking me?

12:04.599 --> 12:06.600
We're taking a trip through time.

12:06.768 --> 12:07.810
Forwards?

12:07.894 --> 12:08.936
No.

12:09.813 --> 12:12.689
Backwards! To the sexy '70s!

12:13.817 --> 12:17.277
Oh, my God! Artie, it's our senior prom.

12:20.490 --> 12:22.491
Burn, baby, burn

12:24.744 --> 12:26.328
I can't believe he's paying us

12:26.413 --> 12:29.123
a thousand bucks to
pretend it's the '70s.

12:29.207 --> 12:32.334
Disco Stu is working pro bono.

12:33.211 --> 12:37.881
Marge, many years ago I turned a
groovy night into a complete bummer.

12:37.966 --> 12:41.009
Tonight you get the
prom you always deserved.

12:41.511 --> 12:45.222
Precious and few are the
moments we two can share

12:45.306 --> 12:47.558
That's very sweet, Artie.

12:47.642 --> 12:49.476
Come, dear. We can dance all night.

12:49.769 --> 12:53.522
The band hasn't worked since
the wrap party for James at 16.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.566
Some say they're cursed.

13:06.953 --> 13:09.663
Oh, my God, it's our high school prom!

13:09.747 --> 13:11.707
And once again I have no date!

13:12.542 --> 13:13.625
Simpson!

13:13.710 --> 13:14.751
Hello, Dondelinger.

13:15.211 --> 13:17.838
You're not on the guest list,
Simpson. Orders of Prom King Ziff.

13:19.048 --> 13:20.090
And have you been drinking?

13:20.175 --> 13:21.967
Just for 25 years.

13:22.051 --> 13:23.343
Let's go, mister.

13:23.428 --> 13:24.720
Oh.

13:28.057 --> 13:30.934
You're very sweet, but no fake prom

13:31.019 --> 13:32.728
could make me forget my husband.

13:33.062 --> 13:34.396
I'm sorry.

13:35.773 --> 13:38.275
Very well, Marge. I
see you'll never feel

13:38.359 --> 13:41.069
about moi the way I feel about toi,

13:41.196 --> 13:42.696
but before the evening ends,

13:42.780 --> 13:46.033
may I request an innocent
peck on the cheek?

13:46.326 --> 13:47.409
Okay.

13:56.252 --> 14:00.756
Oh, no! If Marge marries
Artie, I'll never be born!

14:11.184 --> 14:13.310
Get off me, you little nerd!

14:16.940 --> 14:20.567
I knew this weekend was just
an excuse to get in my mouth.

14:22.195 --> 14:24.530
Keep your money. I'm going home.

14:30.828 --> 14:34.039
Stop looking at me! Keep dancing!

14:34.123 --> 14:35.582
Don't you know how to dance?

14:35.917 --> 14:37.167
Watch me!

14:47.345 --> 14:50.013
Aw! He's gonna sleep tonight.

14:51.933 --> 14:56.812
Oh, guys, it was horrible. I saw
Marge kissing a far superior man.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.772
Well, if it makes you feel any better,

14:58.856 --> 15:00.315
he's probably doing her right now.

15:02.151 --> 15:04.653
Oh, yeah. Make me the bad guy.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.572
My life here is over.

15:07.657 --> 15:11.785
Lenny, how'd you like to leave
town with me and never come back?

15:11.869 --> 15:13.412
Sounds like a plan.

15:13.496 --> 15:14.580
Then it's settled.

15:14.914 --> 15:17.124
We leave Springfield forever.

15:18.543 --> 15:20.085
What'd I miss? Anything good?

15:25.800 --> 15:27.634
That's $912.

15:27.802 --> 15:29.970
Send the bill to
Baron Von Kiss-a-lot.

15:30.054 --> 15:31.179
No problemo.

15:34.559 --> 15:36.810
This just arrived, Herr Baron.

15:37.353 --> 15:39.354
Okay, who's the wise guy?

15:40.857 --> 15:45.027
Oh, Homie, I'm so glad to
see... A tape on the bed?

15:51.200 --> 15:52.993
Marge, if you're watching this

15:53.077 --> 15:54.202
then it means I've figured out

15:54.287 --> 15:59.625
how to work the camera. Last night
I crashed a certain fake prom.

16:00.043 --> 16:02.836
That's right. Artie Ziff's fake prom.

16:04.047 --> 16:05.464
Homer was there?

16:05.548 --> 16:08.216
I saw something terrible
and I can't even say it.

16:08.301 --> 16:11.136
So I'll have these
two dolls do it for me.

16:11.387 --> 16:13.430
Kiss me, Artie.

16:13.514 --> 16:14.931
With pleasure.

16:15.224 --> 16:17.059
Homer's a big jerk.

16:18.895 --> 16:20.646
Ooh.

16:20.730 --> 16:22.439
But I can explain!

16:22.523 --> 16:23.857
I'm leaving you, Marge.

16:23.983 --> 16:27.110
The next time you see my name
will be in the hobo obituaries.

16:27.195 --> 16:30.739
Don't worry about the kids. I'll
drop them off with Patty and Selma.

16:30.823 --> 16:33.241
Patty and Selma? Screw that!

16:33.326 --> 16:34.910
Just run the camera, you little...

16:38.247 --> 16:40.040
Goodbye, my darling.

16:57.850 --> 16:58.850
Oh.

16:58.935 --> 17:02.145
It's no good. Everything
reminds me of Marge.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.028
I know what you're going through.

17:10.113 --> 17:12.280
We're coming up on Mount Carlmore.

17:14.701 --> 17:17.202
I carved that one wonderful summer.

17:17.286 --> 17:18.453
What did Carl think?

17:18.954 --> 17:20.914
You know, we've never discussed it.

17:37.515 --> 17:40.475
Do you have any jobs for
a man who wants to die?

17:40.560 --> 17:41.601
Something indoorsy.

17:41.686 --> 17:43.353
Close to a bathroom?

17:43.646 --> 17:47.607
I'll put you on rig 13 as soon
as they burn off the corpses.

17:48.985 --> 17:50.819
This job will be perfect.

17:50.903 --> 17:53.113
I'm gonna leave this
world the way I entered it,

17:53.197 --> 17:56.533
dirty, screaming, and torn
away from the woman I love.

17:56.617 --> 17:59.870
Oh. Quick and pointless.
That's the death for me.

18:00.163 --> 18:02.497
Thank you. You've been very helpful.

18:02.623 --> 18:04.916
Dad just got a library
card in West Springfield.

18:05.001 --> 18:06.626
He checked out 10 books on oil rigging

18:06.711 --> 18:08.170
and a book called Dying for Dummies.

18:08.254 --> 18:09.921
He must have taken a job

18:10.006 --> 18:11.923
in the West Springfield oil patch.

18:12.008 --> 18:13.383
That's practically a death sentence!

18:14.552 --> 18:17.763
What happened now?
Homer bowled a 300 game?

18:17.930 --> 18:20.807
Grampa, that happened
a year and a half ago.

18:20.892 --> 18:22.976
We have to go save Homer.

18:23.311 --> 18:26.021
But West Springfield's three
times the size of Texas.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.190
We'll never find him there.

18:29.192 --> 18:30.692
Unless...

18:34.030 --> 18:36.948
I really appreciate you
helping me find Homer.

18:37.033 --> 18:38.366
Think nothing of it, Marge.

18:38.451 --> 18:40.076
I hope we can always be friends.

18:40.161 --> 18:41.161
Of course.

18:41.245 --> 18:42.370
With privileges?

18:42.538 --> 18:44.331
Mmm? Mmm?

18:45.500 --> 18:47.083
Does that work on anyone?

18:47.460 --> 18:48.502
No.

18:48.878 --> 18:51.004
But when it does, hello!

19:00.056 --> 19:02.474
Another oil well successfully capped.

19:02.558 --> 19:04.601
Let's raise our goggles in triumph.

19:22.745 --> 19:26.081
Oh, no! This is how
Faceless Joe lost his legs!

19:32.922 --> 19:36.132
Looks like we're goners.
Oh, well. Circle of life.

19:39.554 --> 19:40.720
Marge!

19:43.766 --> 19:45.016
Climb up!

19:47.562 --> 19:49.521
Ain't you coming, Homer? Why?

19:49.605 --> 19:51.690
So I can watch my wife
spend the rest of her life

19:51.774 --> 19:53.567
in the arms of another man?

19:53.651 --> 19:55.944
I don't think so. Good day!

19:56.112 --> 19:57.279
But Homer...

19:57.363 --> 19:58.947
We said good day!

20:05.830 --> 20:08.039
Listen to me, Homer! You've won!

20:08.124 --> 20:11.960
You own Marge's heart, and that's
something I could never buy.

20:12.420 --> 20:13.670
Woo-hoo!

20:15.214 --> 20:17.173
There's nothing on
that helicopter for me.

20:17.258 --> 20:18.717
Don't be so sure.

20:20.094 --> 20:21.887
Carl Carlson?

20:28.895 --> 20:31.479
Artie, thanks for saving my life.

20:32.273 --> 20:34.608
Now, I believe there's the little
matter of the million dollars.

20:34.692 --> 20:36.526
We can't take his money.

20:36.611 --> 20:39.321
Oh. I can't take his money.

20:39.655 --> 20:43.158
I can't print my own money.
I have to work for money.

20:43.326 --> 20:45.785
Why don't I just lie down and die?

20:45.912 --> 20:47.412
Now, Homer, if there's one thing

20:47.496 --> 20:49.414
you should've learned from all this,

20:49.498 --> 20:53.043
it's that I'm rich, rich, rich! And now,

20:55.004 --> 20:57.714
I bid you adieu!

21:00.343 --> 21:02.677
I'm Artie Ziff!

21:04.972 --> 21:07.140
I gotta hand it to Artie Ziff, Marge.

21:07.224 --> 21:09.517
That little nerd saved my life.

21:09.852 --> 21:11.227
And our marriage.

21:11.312 --> 21:14.397
With his latest invention,
the snore converter.

21:16.317 --> 21:17.943
Goodnight, Homie.

21:19.028 --> 21:20.654
Goodnight, honey.

21:31.749 --> 21:34.292
He's a loser, Marge. Dump him!

21:34.377 --> 21:37.712
I travel the world and the seven seas

21:38.214 --> 21:41.508
I am watching you through a camera!
