WEBVTT

00:01.150 --> 00:05.450
In hindsight, we accomplished what was required. 

00:06.500 --> 00:08.800
With Unicron's awakening,

00:09.020 --> 00:10.020
extreme measures needed to be taken.

00:11.530 --> 00:13.630
Enemies became allies,

00:13.680 --> 00:15.780
allies became confidants.

00:17.330 --> 00:18.830
And, with the Matrix of Leadership,

00:21.120 --> 00:23.220
the planet Earth was saved.

00:25.450 --> 00:28.250
Though at immeasurable personal cost...

00:28.320 --> 00:30.620
When Optimus surrendered the Matrix

00:30.690 --> 00:33.890
he'd lost more than the collective
wisdom of the Primes.

00:33.990 --> 00:35.190
Who are they?

00:35.470 --> 00:36.470
Our mortal enemies!

00:43.350 --> 00:45.150
...He lost himself.

00:45.420 --> 00:48.020
That doesn't follow.
Optimus knew Megatron... !

00:48.100 --> 00:49.200
They were like BFFs!

00:51.840 --> 00:54.840
If Optimus did not know his own name,

00:55.040 --> 00:58.740
perhaps it is because the title of Prime
hasn't yet been granted to him.

00:59.480 --> 01:00.310
- Huh?
- What?

01:00.560 --> 01:01.260
Say again?

01:01.540 --> 01:04.739
With the power of the Matrix no longer within him,

01:05.090 --> 01:10.090
it would stand to reason that Optimus
has reverted to his pre-Prime state:

01:10.320 --> 01:14.220
the historical archivist, Orion Pax.

01:14.300 --> 01:16.000
You mean, in his mind.

01:16.100 --> 01:18.600
Are you telling me Prime thinks
he is some kind of

01:18.640 --> 01:20.640
librarian?
AND a Decepticon?!

01:23.280 --> 01:24.380
Attention, crew.

01:24.760 --> 01:28.660
Our guest is currently in isolation,
to help ease his transition.

01:29.680 --> 01:30.680
But when Orion Pax emerges,

01:31.930 --> 01:34.330
he is to be shown every courtesy.

01:34.380 --> 01:38.980
And the first to address him as "Optimus Prime"
will have their voice-box torn out.

01:39.130 --> 01:40.330
Lord Megatron.

01:40.570 --> 01:44.570
Is it wise, to allow an Autobot,
current or former,

01:44.570 --> 01:46.270
full run of the premises?

01:46.820 --> 01:49.620
Nothing happens aboard this ship
without my knowledge.

01:49.770 --> 01:53.170
You would do well to remember that, Airachnid.

01:53.290 --> 01:55.390
But there's no need for concern.

01:55.550 --> 02:00.050
Orion does not possess the same fight
Optimus is so renown for.

02:00.050 --> 02:02.450
Then what use is he to our Cause?

02:02.680 --> 02:07.680
Ah, rest assured, Orion Pax
will indeed earn his stripes.

02:16.820 --> 02:19.920
Welcome back to the winning team.

02:26.840 --> 02:30.500
Script by Skeinweaver

03:14.040 --> 03:16.940
Being a Decepticon is a choice, Agent Fowler. 

03:17.130 --> 03:21.530
One I have a hard time believing 
Optimus would make at any point in his life.

03:21.880 --> 03:24.180
So, if he's riding with the 'Cons...

03:24.250 --> 03:26.650
...it's because Megatron is
working some kind of voodoo.

03:26.920 --> 03:31.520
Orion Pax may not currently
be an Autobot up here,

03:31.560 --> 03:36.560
but I must believe,
he will never stop being one in here.

03:37.440 --> 03:40.140
We must locate him to know for certain.

03:41.070 --> 03:46.670
Hold up. I have a chip lodged in my behind
that let's Uncle Sam know when I stop for donuts.

03:46.740 --> 03:49.340
Are you telling me you can't just track Prime?

03:49.460 --> 03:54.360
Optimus's signal has not reappeared
since he embarked for Earth's core.

03:54.630 --> 03:57.330
But we must get to work finding him.

03:57.390 --> 04:00.490
If we have any hope of initiating his contingency plan.

04:00.610 --> 04:04.530
- Contingency plan?
- What "contingency"?

04:04.700 --> 04:05.400
Is that even a word?

04:05.430 --> 04:08.750
The Key card!
So, what does it do?

04:08.760 --> 04:12.060
It grants access to Vector Sigma,

04:12.090 --> 04:15.190
the repository of the wisdom of the Primes.

04:15.360 --> 04:18.160
Is that some sort of supercomputer?

04:18.260 --> 04:21.459
So, we can just download
Optimus's memories back into him?

04:21.480 --> 04:25.380
Great! Which one is the big V?
Over here? Somewhere in back?

04:25.690 --> 04:29.490
Vector Sigma is more than
a "supercomputer", Jack.

04:29.590 --> 04:32.190
It is an ancient source
of mystical power.

04:34.160 --> 04:36.360
On Cybertron.

04:47.890 --> 04:53.290
You had been a captive of the Autobots
and locked in stasis for quite some time, Orion.

04:53.500 --> 04:57.000
Long enough for us to be
in exodus on another world.

04:57.350 --> 04:59.050
Exodus? Why?

04:59.850 --> 05:02.450
Because the Warlord
Ratchet's careless actions

05:03.120 --> 05:04.620
led to this.

05:11.620 --> 05:13.900
Cybertron!

05:18.900 --> 05:21.500
Jackson Darby!
You will NOT be travelling to another planet.

05:21.820 --> 05:23.020
I'm in!

05:23.040 --> 05:26.890
You're not going either, Miko.
Not while one of YOU can.

05:28.950 --> 05:32.550
June's right.
Why send a boy to do a bot's job?

05:32.770 --> 05:36.070
Because only a Prime can access Vector Sigma.

05:36.120 --> 05:38.720
Or one chosen by a Prime.

05:38.830 --> 05:41.430
Optimus gave the Key card to Jack.

05:41.510 --> 05:45.510
It is now imprinted with his unique biosignature.

05:46.570 --> 05:50.070
So, you mean Jack's like
some kinda honorary Prime?

05:50.110 --> 05:53.310
Let's just say
Jack is the only one who can

05:53.380 --> 05:56.580
return Optimus to the Autobot we knew.

05:56.600 --> 06:00.400
But why would Optimus willfully
endanger a human? A child?

06:00.810 --> 06:02.310
I'm not a child, Mom!

06:02.750 --> 06:05.350
Maybe Optimus believes there's
more to Jack than meets the eye.

06:05.380 --> 06:07.480
All of which is moot.

06:07.530 --> 06:12.330
The Key-card is useless to us
without the means of reaching Cybertron,

06:13.060 --> 06:15.260
which we at present do not possess.

06:16.550 --> 06:18.350
Dude.
What about THAT?

06:18.560 --> 06:22.160
Miko, the Ground bridge barely got
them into Earth orbit, remember?

06:22.230 --> 06:23.930
Yeah, but Ratchet built it.

06:24.110 --> 06:26.210
Can't he just turbo-charge the thing?

06:31.420 --> 06:35.220
I cannot believe
Ratchet capable of such horrors.

06:36.810 --> 06:42.310
Yes. And to think the Doctor of Doom's mad
quest for power continues...

06:42.730 --> 06:45.730
his marauders pursued us to this planet's orbit.

06:45.820 --> 06:48.520
We feel its species are not ready to behold us.

06:49.040 --> 06:54.340
But we have resolved to protect this world
from the same tragedy which was dealt to our own.

06:54.340 --> 06:56.880
One question, Megatron.

06:56.880 --> 06:58.980
Why are we called Decepticons?

07:01.480 --> 07:04.480
Another craven Autobot scare tactic.

07:04.680 --> 07:07.280
The name was meant to demonize us.
Instead,

07:07.370 --> 07:12.370
we wear it as a badge of honour.
For if speaking the truth is deception,

07:12.530 --> 07:15.430
then we are gladly guilty.

07:17.240 --> 07:18.840
Now please, Orion.

07:18.930 --> 07:22.430
There will be plenty of time for catching up.
You must rest.

07:26.090 --> 07:27.990
Megatron!

07:28.500 --> 07:32.900
I will do my part to stop Ratchet's
unspeakable crimes of aggression.

07:34.380 --> 07:37.980
This I vow.
With all my Spark.

07:51.590 --> 07:56.090
It seems we have successfully
achieved control of Orion's spark. 

07:56.140 --> 07:59.240
Now, to put his mind to work.

08:01.030 --> 08:02.930
Have you sanitized the data-core?

08:04.320 --> 08:10.120
Excellent. Our new archivist will
require unlimited access to our files.

08:10.340 --> 08:15.040
It would be counterproductive for him
to stumble upon any sensitive information.

08:20.420 --> 08:22.820
Two "body slamburger" specials.
Enjoy!

08:27.160 --> 08:28.460
Hey Jack!

08:28.660 --> 08:29.960
Sierra!

08:30.020 --> 08:32.919
How come I never see you around?

08:32.929 --> 08:35.230
W-what are you talking about?
We have chemistry together.

08:36.500 --> 08:38.700
Ehm, "class"!
Chemistry class.

08:39.659 --> 08:42.260
I mean, outside of school.

08:42.380 --> 08:44.680
I never see you at any parties or at the mall.

08:45.820 --> 08:49.120
Well, mostly I'm here, wearing the hat.

08:49.160 --> 08:52.660
And you never can study too hard
for the old SATs, you know.

08:52.680 --> 08:54.380
And, there's some other... stuff.

08:56.300 --> 08:58.300
Oh. Don't go anywhere!

08:59.660 --> 09:01.460
Welcome to K.O. drive-in,
may I take your...

09:01.490 --> 09:03.490
5 PM, Jack.
Your shift is over.

09:03.570 --> 09:04.570
Let's go.

09:04.620 --> 09:08.050
Oh!
THAT kind of... "stuff".

09:10.240 --> 09:14.380
Sierra, wait!
She's my mother!

09:21.880 --> 09:25.280
Your mom looks good in leather.
On your bike.

09:29.440 --> 09:31.340
Didn't mean to decimate your social life.

09:31.360 --> 09:34.260
Not the first time.
Any sign of Optimus?

09:34.350 --> 09:35.350
Not today.

09:36.560 --> 09:38.360
Not yet!

09:39.020 --> 09:44.420
When we stormed the Iacon Hall of Records
in the winning days of the war for Cybertron,

09:44.470 --> 09:47.570
we acquired highly classified files.

09:47.590 --> 09:52.590
Files written with Autobot codes
which we had been unable to decipher.

09:52.660 --> 09:54.260
Autobot codes

09:54.350 --> 09:57.250
which the Iacon archivist Orion Pax

09:57.300 --> 10:00.500
should have no trouble cracking.

10:00.510 --> 10:02.110
Considering what's at stake,

10:02.220 --> 10:04.620
shouldn't we beef up the security around here?

10:05.720 --> 10:10.120
Knockout, I believe that Orion
will perform most effectively

10:10.150 --> 10:14.350
if he does not feel threatened
or confined in any way.

10:14.700 --> 10:19.200
However, it is no coincidence
that Orion's work-station

10:19.210 --> 10:24.410
is located in direct proximity
to the Energon storage vault.

10:24.590 --> 10:29.590
Which is under constant surveillance...
Well played.

10:40.720 --> 10:42.420
Ratchet! Are you

10:42.500 --> 10:45.300
turbo-charging
the Ground-bridge?

10:45.490 --> 10:46.490
Tinkering.

10:47.210 --> 10:49.710
No need to get anyone's hopes up, just yet.

10:59.310 --> 11:01.910
Orion!
How fares project "Iacon"?

11:03.050 --> 11:07.840
I am a bit rusty, I fear.
I've only managed to decode three entries.

11:07.900 --> 11:10.800
And what do these entries comprise?

11:10.950 --> 11:16.450
They were logged by Autobot archivist
during the war after I entered stasis.

11:16.480 --> 11:21.380
My only knowledge of its content
so far is that they are coordinates,

11:21.510 --> 11:25.310
targeting locations on this very planet.

11:27.660 --> 11:34.060
I surmise that they could indicate hiding places for vessels
shuttled from Cybertron for safe-keeping.

11:35.320 --> 11:40.420
Such as historical documents
or cultural artifacts?

11:41.680 --> 11:44.780
My greatest fear would be
weapons of mass destruction.

11:45.190 --> 11:47.490
Hidden away for later use.

11:48.880 --> 11:51.980
All the more reason it is essential that we do
everything in our power

11:52.000 --> 11:56.000
to keep said vessels from Autobot reach.

11:56.800 --> 11:59.800
We are fortunate to have you on our side, Orion Pax.

12:02.330 --> 12:03.830
Lord Megatron.

12:05.190 --> 12:08.190
I am puzzled by one particular finding.

12:08.320 --> 12:16.020
I have discovered several historic references
to Starscream as your second-in-command.

12:16.420 --> 12:19.520
Yet I have not seen him
aboard the ship.

12:20.620 --> 12:23.420
Sadly, Commander Starscream is dead.

12:35.240 --> 12:37.640
Orion asks many questions.

12:37.740 --> 12:42.340
A valuable trait in an archivist,
but not in a Decepticon.

12:43.540 --> 12:46.740
It is a matter of time before
he unravels our fabrications

12:46.770 --> 12:51.370
and his innate sense of right
and wrong rises to the surface...

12:51.600 --> 12:58.200
I only hope that Orion will complete project "Iacon"
before I am forced to destroy him,

12:58.280 --> 13:00.180
once and for all.

13:07.860 --> 13:09.445
Ratchet! You awake?

13:09.446 --> 13:11.030
This is an emergency!

13:11.270 --> 13:13.870
Agent Fowler!
Is it Optimus?

13:14.170 --> 13:15.220
It's 'Cons!

13:15.240 --> 13:15.860
And they're busting into

13:15.860 --> 13:19.530
the same military research lab
they hit two months ago.

13:20.360 --> 13:21.410
Another Space-bridge?

13:21.830 --> 13:23.830
But for all we know Optimus
is riding with them.

13:24.350 --> 13:26.270
Roll out!

13:43.370 --> 13:44.470
Drop the power source!

13:45.350 --> 13:48.620
Aren't you missing someone?

14:03.181 --> 14:04.826
Ready for that bridge!

14:06.580 --> 14:11.280
We'll be sure to tell the big O
you said "Hello".

14:14.940 --> 14:17.640
Arcee!

14:30.090 --> 14:31.890
Scrap.

14:45.940 --> 14:48.640
Where's Optimus?

14:48.940 --> 14:51.540
Answer me!

15:20.210 --> 15:21.380
What?!

15:21.710 --> 15:26.910
Arcee...
Allow me to welcome her aboard.

15:27.250 --> 15:28.080
No!

15:28.290 --> 15:31.200
If Orion so much as lays eyes on another Autobot

15:31.420 --> 15:34.720
let alone be allowed to witness its destruction,

15:34.800 --> 15:37.850
everything he currently believes
will be called into question.

15:38.260 --> 15:45.550
See to it that Arcee is escorted off 
this ship immediately!

16:09.940 --> 16:16.400
Orion! Please return to your station.
Lord Megatron's orders.

16:49.780 --> 16:51.380
I heard a commotion.

17:05.510 --> 17:07.210
What the...?

17:12.970 --> 17:18.359
You weren't able to determine the Decepticons' location
or if Optimus was even aboard ship?

17:18.849 --> 17:21.470
I... couldn't confirm.

17:23.573 --> 17:26.359
- Bulkhead!
- What? You needed that?

17:26.800 --> 17:29.130
Only thing I need is our head honcho back!

17:30.340 --> 17:32.400
It's not your fault.

17:32.440 --> 17:35.133
If any of us needed rescuing
Optimus would have found a way.

17:35.134 --> 17:36.480
I didn't. Simple as that.

17:37.510 --> 17:38.240
Ratchet!

17:38.380 --> 17:42.550
What happened out there?
Reports indicate at least a dozen wounded.

17:42.740 --> 17:44.840
The hits on me to provide some explanation.

17:45.200 --> 17:49.800
You bots better get your act together
or the Pentagon will make me shut down your base.

17:49.800 --> 17:50.660
But... where would you go?

17:51.060 --> 17:52.370
Who knows.

17:52.860 --> 17:58.290
Maybe they'll ship us out to some island or fire us into space!
Wouldn't that be a welcome relief.

17:58.390 --> 18:00.390
I don't blame Fowler!

18:00.490 --> 18:04.190
Optimus would have evacuated all humans in the area
before engaging the 'Cons.

18:06.150 --> 18:09.330
We don't actually know what Optimus
would have done because he's not here!

18:09.710 --> 18:11.710
You're pretty good at stating the obvious, Bulk.

18:12.050 --> 18:14.250
Anything else you'd like to mention
that we already know?

18:14.360 --> 18:16.920
Nothing I can say in front of the children.

18:16.920 --> 18:19.920
Hey!
Aren't we overlooking one positive?

18:19.950 --> 18:23.290
Nobody's talking about what the 'Cons
just got their claws on.

18:23.500 --> 18:28.360
Yes, we managed to allow them to finally
acquire a power source for their space bridge!

18:28.810 --> 18:32.110
And how exactly that would be a positive?

18:32.620 --> 18:34.720
We let them finish building their Space-bridge.

18:34.760 --> 18:38.260
Why? So they can bring more
zombies back from Cybertron?

18:38.410 --> 18:41.410
No.
So we can commandeer it.

18:41.610 --> 18:44.340
And use it
to send ME to Cybertron.

18:44.350 --> 18:46.300
Woah.
That's a pretty good idea.

18:46.560 --> 18:50.260
Oh well.
If Miko thinks it's a good idea...

18:50.380 --> 18:53.980
Nobody saying it will be easy
but you've seized the Space-bridge before!

18:54.720 --> 19:00.120
We blew one up. That's a whole lot different
than seizing and holding one.

19:01.880 --> 19:03.880
Bee's right.
We have to find that thing first.

19:04.620 --> 19:08.330
Hellooo!
If it's a space bridge... isn't it?

19:09.410 --> 19:15.350
The term "space" refers to its transport range,
not its physical location.

19:15.450 --> 19:20.430
And we've been monitoring Earth's orbit since the last one,
we'd know if it were there.

19:20.610 --> 19:23.350
So, the Bridge could be somewhere
right here on Earth?

19:23.400 --> 19:27.930
- Like trying to find a servo at a scrapyard.
- Then maybe we better start looking.

19:27.980 --> 19:32.680
But the fact remains: We don't know
what the Decepticons have in store for Optimus.

19:33.090 --> 19:35.890
Or if he's truly safe from harm.

20:19.540 --> 20:20.840
Starscream!

20:22.360 --> 20:24.260
That's "Commander Starscream".

20:25.440 --> 20:29.478
What's your malfunction?
Lower those weapons immediately.

20:29.697 --> 20:34.700
I'm sorry, Sir, but Lord Megatron ordered that you be taken
into custody should you ever return to the ship.

20:34.960 --> 20:41.140
What?
Clearly, there has been a mistake.

21:20.730 --> 21:22.130
No!

21:22.540 --> 21:25.540
Optimus Prime?!
