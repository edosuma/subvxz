WEBVTT

00:04.200 --> 00:05.700
OW! ZACK,

00:05.700 --> 00:08.567
CODY, NO BASKETBALL
IN THE LOBBY!

00:08.567 --> 00:11.467
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
WE'RE PLAYING
BASKETB--

00:13.600 --> 00:15.033
OH.

00:15.033 --> 00:16.367
YO, TOSS THE ROCK.

00:16.367 --> 00:22.400
OH! YOU GENTLEMEN MUST BE
THE ROCKLAND ROLLERS, HUH?

00:22.400 --> 00:24.400
OH, WONDERFUL.

00:24.400 --> 00:25.900
WELCOME TO THE TIPTON.

00:25.900 --> 00:27.867
NOW, OVER HERE, BOYS.

00:27.867 --> 00:29.867
HEADS UP!

00:29.867 --> 00:31.600
OH!
[DING]

00:33.100 --> 00:35.233
YES?

00:35.233 --> 00:37.500
FALSE ALARM, ESTEBAN.
OH!

00:37.500 --> 00:39.300
YES!

00:39.300 --> 00:41.400
NOW, CHILL!

00:41.400 --> 00:44.700
WHAT ARE YOU BOYS THINKING
TEARING UP THIS MAN'S HOTEL?

00:44.700 --> 00:46.700
Y'ALL TRYING TO MAKE
THE COACH LOOK BAD?

00:46.700 --> 00:49.800
All: SORRY, COACH.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.700
CHILDREN WHO LISTEN
TO ADULTS?

00:51.700 --> 00:53.567
HOW REFRESHING.

00:53.567 --> 00:55.200
AND YOU LETTING THEM
TEAR IT UP.

00:55.200 --> 00:56.967
OK.

00:56.967 --> 00:59.300
YEAH, HOW COME THEY
CAN PLAY BASKETBALL
IN THE LOBBY

00:59.300 --> 01:00.400
AND WE CAN'T?

01:00.400 --> 01:02.600
YOU KNOW, IT'S
JUST THAT, UH...

01:02.600 --> 01:05.200
YOU KNOW,
I MEAN, THEY'RE--
I DIDN'T WANT TO--

01:05.200 --> 01:06.100
IN WHEELCHAIRS?

01:06.100 --> 01:08.767
ARE THEY?
I HADN'T NOTICED.

01:09.600 --> 01:10.800
SHALL I CHECK YOU IN?

01:10.800 --> 01:11.834
SURE.
OK.

01:11.834 --> 01:13.300
THANKS, MAN.

01:13.300 --> 01:15.900
HEY, LISTEN,
FOR FUTURE REFERENCE,

01:15.900 --> 01:17.467
JUST BECAUSE A PERSON
IS IN A WHEELCHAIR

01:17.467 --> 01:19.700
DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO
GIVE THEM SPECIAL TREATMENT.

01:19.700 --> 01:21.200
OH, OF COURSE.

01:21.200 --> 01:24.100
NOW, WHY DON'T YOU
JUST SIGN HERE
FOR THE ROOMS?

01:24.100 --> 01:27.500
WHOA! PARTNER,
MAN, THIS IS STEEP!

01:27.500 --> 01:30.000
MAN, I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU WON'T GIVE A BROTHER
IN A WHEELCHAIR A BREAK.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.233
UH, BUT--

01:31.233 --> 01:35.834
PERHAPS A
SPECIAL ADJUSTMENT
CAN BE MADE.

01:35.834 --> 01:37.834
WHAT DID I JUST
TELL YOU

01:37.834 --> 01:39.033
ABOUT GIVING
PEOPLE IN WHEELCHAIRS
SPECIAL TREATMENT?

01:39.033 --> 01:41.800
OK, I'M SO SORRY!
HOW CAN I MAKE IT UP
TO YOU?

01:41.800 --> 01:44.600
HOW ABOUT A DISCOUNT?

01:44.600 --> 01:47.500
YOU JUST SAID--
WE HAD THE WHOLE
CONVERSATION ABOUT--

01:47.500 --> 01:49.567
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU LIKE!
PAY WHATEVER

01:49.567 --> 01:52.300

MADDIE, THAT MAKE UP
YOU'RE WEARING

02:43.467 --> 02:45.400
MAKES YOU LOOK
ALL SAD.

02:45.400 --> 02:47.133
I AM SAD.

02:47.133 --> 02:48.834
OH, NO.

02:48.834 --> 02:50.500
NOW YOU'RE PROBABLY
GONNA TELL ME WHY,

02:50.500 --> 02:52.900
AND I'M GONNA HAVE
TO PRETEND TO CARE.

02:52.900 --> 02:54.600
LONDON, YOU'RE
THE LAST PERSON

02:54.600 --> 02:56.467
I WOULD EVER GO TO
FOR SYMPATHY.

02:56.467 --> 02:57.500
OK.

02:57.500 --> 02:59.867
I CAN'T FIND
A LEADING LADY
FOR MY MOVIE.

02:59.867 --> 03:02.934
HERE'S ME
PRETENDING TO CARE.

03:02.934 --> 03:06.300
WHAT MOVIE, MADDIE?

03:06.300 --> 03:08.300
MY STUDENT FILM.

03:08.300 --> 03:10.200
WHAT'S IT ABOUT?

03:10.200 --> 03:12.033
WELL, IT'S ABOUT
SOCIETY'S INDIFFERENCE

03:12.033 --> 03:13.367
TOWARDS
THE IMPOVERISHED

03:13.367 --> 03:14.500
AND THE TRIUMPH
OF THE SPIRIT

03:14.500 --> 03:16.967
OVER OPPRESSIVE
SOCI-ECONOMIC
CIRCUMSTANCE.

03:16.967 --> 03:20.100
WHAT'S IT ABOUT?

03:20.100 --> 03:23.000
IT'S ABOUT A GIRL
AND A BOY.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.600
OH! SOUNDS GOOD.
CAN I BE THE GIRL?

03:25.600 --> 03:26.600
WELL, CAN YOU ACT?

03:26.600 --> 03:27.600
I JUST PRETENDED

03:27.600 --> 03:29.900
TO LISTEN TO
EVERYTHING YOU SAID.

03:29.900 --> 03:32.033
YOU DID, DIDN'T YOU?

03:32.033 --> 03:33.300
HMM.

03:33.300 --> 03:34.934
OK, ALL RIGHT,
YOU'RE IN!

03:34.934 --> 03:36.467
SO, WHO AM I KISSING?

03:36.467 --> 03:37.700
SORRY I'M LATE.

03:37.700 --> 03:39.033
SOME KID THREW UP
IN THE HOT TUB.

03:39.033 --> 03:40.600
IT'S REALLY HARD
TO PICK UP THE CHUNKS

03:40.600 --> 03:43.200
WHEN THEY'RE SWIRLING
AROUND LIKE THAT.

03:43.200 --> 03:44.467
YOU'LL BE KISSING HIM.

03:44.467 --> 03:47.800
OK, I'LL KISS HIM,
BUT I WON'T SHAKE
HIS HAND.

03:47.800 --> 03:49.000
UH, MADDIE?
YEAH?

03:49.000 --> 03:51.367
ON PAGE TWO OF YOUR SCRIPT,
IT SAYS I ENTER WALKING.

03:51.367 --> 03:54.400
I WAS THINKING INSTEAD,
MAYBE I SHOULD
ENTER SWIMMING.

03:54.400 --> 03:55.767
YOUR SCENE IS OUTSIDE.

03:55.767 --> 03:59.967
WE'D HAVE TO DIG UP THE STREET
AND PUT IN A SWIMMING POOL.

03:59.967 --> 04:02.900
I THINK IT MIGHT
BE WORTH IT.

04:04.200 --> 04:07.200
DUDE, YOU GOT TO GET
OVER HERE RIGHT NOW.

04:07.200 --> 04:09.100
JESSICA SIMPSON IS
IN THE HOTEL.

04:09.100 --> 04:10.467
JESSICA SIMPSON IS HERE?

04:10.467 --> 04:13.200
OH, MAYBE I CAN GET HER TO
PERFORM FOR A PTA FUNDRAISER.

04:13.200 --> 04:16.834
I DON'T THINK THE BAKE SALE
IS GOING TO GO VERY WELL.

04:16.834 --> 04:19.100
DON'T BE SILLY.
JESSICA SIMPSON ISN'T HERE.

04:19.100 --> 04:21.600
OH, I JUST SAW HER
WALK BY.

04:21.600 --> 04:23.200
HI, JESSICA!

04:23.200 --> 04:25.000
HEY, Y'ALL!

04:25.000 --> 04:27.900
WANT TO COME HANG OUT
WITH ME BY THE POOL?

04:27.900 --> 04:31.467
I NEED SOMEONE TO HELP RUB IN
MY SUNTAN LOTION.

04:32.233 --> 04:34.800
JAMIE'S ON HIS WAY.

04:34.800 --> 04:36.500
I MISS JAMIE.

04:36.500 --> 04:37.767
YEAH, ME, TOO.

04:37.767 --> 04:39.867
WE USED TO GET IN
SO MUCH...

04:39.867 --> 04:42.700
GOOD CLEAN FUN
TOGETHER.

04:42.700 --> 04:45.467
JAMIE HASN'T
BEEN THE SAME
SINCE HIS ACCIDENT.

04:45.467 --> 04:48.467
YEAH. ALL HE EVER DOES
IS GO STRAIGHT TO SCHOOL

04:48.467 --> 04:50.100
AND THEN GO STRAIGHT HOME.

04:50.100 --> 04:51.500
LIKE CODY.

04:51.500 --> 04:52.734
EXCUSE ME.

04:52.734 --> 04:54.467
YOU'RE FORGETTING
ABOUT STAMP CLUB?

04:54.467 --> 04:56.400
I CAME UP WITH
OUR MOTTO:

04:56.400 --> 04:59.834
YOU CAN'T LICK US.

04:59.834 --> 05:04.000
WELL, HERE'S MY MOTTO:
MY BROTHER'S A GEEK.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.500
ANYWAY...

05:06.500 --> 05:08.200
REMEMBER THOSE KIDS
PLAYING BASKETBALL IN THE LOBBY?

05:08.200 --> 05:09.400
MM-HMM.

05:09.400 --> 05:11.033
WELL, I WAS HOPING
IF JAMIE MEETS THEM,

05:11.033 --> 05:13.100
HE MIGHT BE INTERESTED
IN BASKETBALL AGAIN.

05:13.100 --> 05:15.033
HE WAS THE BEST PLAYER
ON OUR TEAM.

05:15.033 --> 05:16.500
AHEM.

05:16.500 --> 05:19.100
HE WAS THE BEST PLAYER
ON OUR TEAM.

05:19.100 --> 05:22.033
AND NOW HE WON'T EVEN
PICK UP A BALL.

05:22.033 --> 05:23.900
I THINK IT'S GREAT
THAT YOU GUYS WANT
TO HELP YOUR FRIEND,

05:23.900 --> 05:25.500
BUT WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN JAMIE GETS HERE

05:25.500 --> 05:26.967
AND THERE'S NO
JESSICA SIMPSON?

05:28.100 --> 05:31.934
OH, NO. I AM NOT
PUTTING ON A BIKINI.

05:33.500 --> 05:36.100
ESTEBAN, THANKS AGAIN
FOR BEING MY CAMERAMAN.

05:36.100 --> 05:40.233
I PREFER
CINEMAPHOTOGRAPHER.

05:40.233 --> 05:42.800
OK, HOW DO YOU WORK
THIS THING?

05:42.800 --> 05:44.734
YOU PUSH THE
LITTLE RED BUTTON.

05:44.734 --> 05:47.667
OH. START, AH. STOP.

05:47.667 --> 05:49.100
START. STOP.

05:49.100 --> 05:51.300
STOP!
OK!

05:51.300 --> 05:53.100
NOT UNTIL
I SAY "ACTION. "

05:53.100 --> 05:58.000
OK, LONDON, YOUR CHARACTER
IS SELLING HER WARES.

05:58.000 --> 05:59.000
WHAT WARES?

05:59.000 --> 06:00.700
THOSE WARES.

06:00.700 --> 06:02.100
WHERE?
THERE!

06:02.100 --> 06:03.133
YOUR WARES ARE THERE!

06:03.133 --> 06:04.200
PEARS.

06:04.200 --> 06:05.934
THE PEARS ARE MY WARES?

06:05.934 --> 06:09.600
OK, LANCE, REMEMBER,
YOU'RE RICH.

06:09.600 --> 06:10.600
RICH WHO?

06:10.600 --> 06:11.900
NO. I MEAN
YOU HAVE MONEY.

06:11.900 --> 06:15.500
SO I'M RICH...
AND MY NAME IS RICH?

06:15.500 --> 06:17.300
COOL.

06:17.300 --> 06:20.000
NO, NO. YOUR NAME
ISN'T RICH.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.500
WHAT'S MY NAME, THEN?

06:21.500 --> 06:22.900
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

06:22.900 --> 06:24.800
THEN WHY CAN'T
IT BE RICH?

06:24.800 --> 06:26.133
OK, IT'S RICH!

06:26.133 --> 06:29.834
LOOK, I AM TRYING TO WIN
A FILM FESTIVAL HERE, PEOPLE!

06:29.834 --> 06:31.300
OK, LANCE,

06:31.300 --> 06:32.834
YOU'RE ABOUT
TO ENTER THE HOTEL

06:32.834 --> 06:36.200
WHEN YOU SEE THIS POOR GIRL
IN TATTERED CLOTHING.

06:36.200 --> 06:39.100
OH, THANKS FOR LENDING ME
YOUR CLOTHES, MADDIE.

06:41.300 --> 06:43.033
RIGHT.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.500
LET'S TRY THIS, PEOPLE.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.667
AND...ACTION!

06:51.667 --> 06:54.500
PUSHING THE
RECORD BUTTON...NOW.

06:55.867 --> 06:57.967
OH, POOR SALES GIRL,

06:57.967 --> 06:59.767
CAN YOU TELL ME
WHERE I MIGHT FIND
THE ROOM

06:59.767 --> 07:01.300
OF PRINCESS
ANASTASIA?

07:01.300 --> 07:03.700
UH, LINE, PLEASE?

07:03.700 --> 07:04.834
NO.

07:04.834 --> 07:08.100
FINE. THEN I'LL JUST
GO LOOK IT UP IN MY SCRIPT.

07:08.100 --> 07:11.467
NO, NO, NO.
YOUR LINE IS, "NO."

07:11.467 --> 07:13.500
WHAT IS
GOING ON HERE?

07:13.500 --> 07:17.300
AND WHY ARE YOU WEARING
MADDIE'S CLOTHES?

07:17.300 --> 07:20.600
I'M SHOOTING
MY STUDENT FILM.
OR TRYING TO.

07:20.600 --> 07:23.567
BUT YOU CAN'T SHOOT
IN FRONT OF MY HOTEL.

07:23.567 --> 07:24.667
I CAN'T?

07:24.667 --> 07:25.800
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

07:25.800 --> 07:27.600
IT WOULD DISRUPT
MY GUESTS.

07:27.600 --> 07:29.767
WAIT...

07:29.767 --> 07:32.000
SAY THAT AGAIN.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.233
SAY WHAT?

07:33.233 --> 07:34.467
WHAT YOU JUST SAID.

07:34.467 --> 07:36.500
I MEAN, THE POWER
OF YOUR VOICE,

07:36.500 --> 07:39.767
IT'S--IT'S RIVETING.

07:39.767 --> 07:41.400
RIVETING?

07:41.400 --> 07:43.200
YEAH.

07:43.200 --> 07:44.600
YOU MEAN WHEN I SAID,

07:44.600 --> 07:45.700
ABSOLUTELY NOT!

07:45.700 --> 07:48.100
YOU'LL DISRUPT
MY GUESTS!

07:49.400 --> 07:51.233
OH, WOW!
I MEAN...

07:51.233 --> 07:55.233
YOU WOULD BE PERFECT
FOR THE PART OF--OF
THE HOTEL MANAGER!

07:55.233 --> 07:56.400
OH!

07:56.400 --> 07:58.867
I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU'VE
DONE ANY ACTING BEFORE.

07:58.867 --> 08:00.867
WELL, ACTUALLY,
IN SECOND GRADE
I PLAYED A PIRATE.

08:00.867 --> 08:03.300
MY TEACHER GAVE ME
TWO HOOKS UP! ARGH!

08:03.300 --> 08:05.000
ARGH!

08:05.000 --> 08:06.200
YOU'RE HIRED!

08:06.200 --> 08:07.934
OH, GREAT, I'LL
GO GET MY PEG LEG!

08:07.934 --> 08:09.800
OK.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.367
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

08:14.367 --> 08:16.967
I'LL GET IT.

08:16.967 --> 08:18.467
THERE'S NO ONE THERE.

08:18.467 --> 08:21.300
Man: HELLO!
I'M DOWN HERE!

08:21.300 --> 08:23.100
ARGH...

08:23.100 --> 08:25.567
HEY, DARYL.
THANKS FOR COMING
TO MEET OUR FRIEND.

08:25.567 --> 08:26.467
HEY, NO PROBLEM.

08:26.467 --> 08:29.500
DARYL! HI, I'M CARRIE.

08:29.500 --> 08:31.700
I HAVE BEEN WANTING
TO MEET YOU

08:31.700 --> 08:32.700
SINCE I SAW YOU
AT MY SHOW LAST NIGHT.

08:32.700 --> 08:35.233
OH, REALLY? MMM...

08:35.233 --> 08:37.000
[SPRAYS]

08:38.000 --> 08:40.800
OH, NO, I'M NOT
INTERESTED IN YOU FOR THAT.

08:40.800 --> 08:43.600
I MEAN,
NOT THAT I COULDN'T BE.

08:43.600 --> 08:46.767
I MEAN, YOU'RE A VERY
ATTRACTIVE MAN.

08:46.767 --> 08:48.500
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY--

08:48.500 --> 08:49.867
I DATED A GUY
IN A WHEELCHAIR ONCE.

08:49.867 --> 08:50.967
MAYBE YOU KNOW HIM!

08:50.967 --> 08:52.834
AW...
AW...

08:52.834 --> 08:55.133
CARRIE, LISTEN,
I WAS JUST PLAYING AROUND.

08:55.133 --> 08:56.867
I HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.

08:56.867 --> 08:58.700
OH, IS SHE
IN A WHEELCHAIR, TOO?

08:58.700 --> 09:02.400
NO, SHE CAN WALK.
MAYBE YOU KNOW HER?

09:02.400 --> 09:05.000
OK, OK, WHAT
I WANTED TO ASK WAS,

09:05.000 --> 09:06.967
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE
IN TOWN FOR A TOURNAMENT,

WHAT ARE YOU DOING
ON THE COURT?

19:08.867 --> 19:11.400
WELL, I DECIDED
I BETTER PLAY.

19:11.400 --> 19:12.367

YOU GUYS

19:13.700 --> 19:15.834

20:22.734 --> 20:25.400
[BUZZER SOUNDS]

20:26.700 --> 20:29.200
I DON'T KNOW
WHY EVERYBODY'S
SO HAPPY.

20:29.200 --> 20:30.500
WE STILL LOST.

20:30.500 --> 20:33.000
YEAH, BUT ONLY
BY SINGLE DIGITS.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.233
SINGLE DIGITS, BABY.

20:36.867 --> 20:38.500

20:38.500 --> 20:40.600
AND AS FOR THE REST
OF YOU GUYS,

20:40.600 --> 20:43.867
I HOPE YOU'RE BETTER
ON YOUR FEET.

20:43.867 --> 20:45.100
ACTUALLY, WE'RE WORSE.

20:45.100 --> 20:46.700
SO, JAMIE, I'M STARTING
A TEAM IN BOSTON.

20:46.700 --> 20:47.900
ARE YOU INTERESTED?

20:47.900 --> 20:50.400
SURE. WELL, I MEAN...

20:50.400 --> 20:52.367
ALL I WANT IS A CAR,
A HOUSE FOR MY PARENTS,

20:52.367 --> 20:53.600
AND $50,000.

20:53.600 --> 20:54.867
HOW ABOUT INSTEAD

20:54.867 --> 20:56.400
I TEACH YOU
HOW TO USE SYMPATHY
TO PICK UP GIRLS?

20:56.400 --> 20:57.500

20:57.500 --> 21:00.700

21:02.300 --> 21:06.667

GREAT JOB!

21:08.500 --> 21:11.500
YOU KNOW, I, UH,
DID COACH A LITTLE BIT.

21:11.500 --> 21:13.567
SORRY.

21:13.567 --> 21:16.033

21:16.033 --> 21:17.300

PLAYING PIRATES!

21:31.967 --> 21:34.300
MY FANS DEMAND IT.

21:34.300 --> 21:36.000
Lance: HEY, IF HE
GETS TO BE A PIRATE,

21:36.000 --> 21:38.300
I GET TO BE A MER-MAN!

21:38.300 --> 21:40.967

STREET WITH YOU!

21:40.967 --> 21:45.800

21:46.967 --> 21:48.000
Maddie:
SO AS YOU CAN SEE,

21:48.000 --> 21:50.200
IT'S NOT EASY
MAKING A STUDENT FILM.

21:50.200 --> 21:52.000
HELLO? HELLO?

21:52.000 --> 21:54.567
HEY, IS THIS THING ON?

21:54.567 --> 21:55.734

YOU GUYS THINK?

21:57.200 --> 21:59.500
WELL, IT'S NOT
A VERY GOOD LOVE STORY.

21:59.500 --> 22:01.967
THAT'S BECAUSE
I EDITED IT
INTO A COMEDY,

22:01.967 --> 22:04.400
WHICH WASN'T TOO HARD
WITH YOUR PERFORMANCES.

22:04.400 --> 22:05.600
THANKS.

22:05.600 --> 22:07.300
I DO HAVE A GIFT
FOR COMEDY.

22:07.300 --> 22:10.467
THANKS TO YOU GUYS,
MY FILM WON THE GOLDEN GIGGLE.

22:10.467 --> 22:12.867
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE SHOULD DO A SEQUEL.

22:12.867 --> 22:14.033
WHAT?

22:14.033 --> 22:15.400
MAYBE A MUCUSAL.

22:15.400 --> 22:17.200
OH, WE COULD SHOOT
IN THE POOL.

22:17.200 --> 22:18.900
I COULD DO A WHALE SONG.

22:18.900 --> 22:22.400
OO-OOH-OOH...

22:22.400 --> 22:23.867
