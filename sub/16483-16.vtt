00:01.252 --> 00:03.337
<i>Previously,
on</i> Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...

00:03.504 --> 00:05.256
It seems, Radcliffe is keeping
our team alive

00:05.423 --> 00:08.009
in this Framework thing.
Which means they can be rescued.

00:08.175 --> 00:10.720
So you just plug yourself
in to these avatars?

00:10.886 --> 00:12.930
Hook up with our people and find out
where on Earth their bodies

00:13.055 --> 00:14.932
- are being held.
- Meet at the rendezvous right away.

00:15.099 --> 00:16.684
<i>That's where I programmed
the backdoor to get out.</i>

00:18.686 --> 00:20.479
<i>Reality is just perception.</i>

00:20.604 --> 00:23.524
<i>They perceive it as real,
which makes it real.</i>

00:23.691 --> 00:25.985
<i>- They might not believe that.
- But I do.</i>

00:26.360 --> 00:28.404
<i>I am saving these people.</i>

00:33.701 --> 00:34.702
Lincoln?

00:58.642 --> 00:59.894
Lincoln.

01:05.107 --> 01:06.150
Morning.

01:07.485 --> 01:08.527
That a thing we do now?

01:10.029 --> 01:11.530
Tell me it means
you're making the coffee.

01:15.868 --> 01:16.911
Ward.

01:20.414 --> 01:21.457
It's, uh...

01:22.249 --> 01:23.250
Sorry. You j...

01:25.169 --> 01:26.170
You startled me.

01:26.796 --> 01:28.672
It's not like I snuck in here.

01:31.717 --> 01:32.718
So, what's up?

01:34.762 --> 01:36.597
We got called in to work.

01:38.724 --> 01:39.725
Okay.

01:50.277 --> 01:51.320
I'll get dressed.

01:52.530 --> 01:53.656
Weirdo.

01:59.787 --> 02:02.248
You know we've spent
more nights out tracking Inhumans

02:02.414 --> 02:03.749
than we've had at home?

02:04.917 --> 02:06.585
Bosses can't give us
a morning off?

02:08.795 --> 02:10.548
Bosses. Mm.

02:11.382 --> 02:14.760
Who do you think's running
the brief?

02:15.678 --> 02:17.513
Well, I don't know.
You got the text.

02:30.109 --> 02:31.235
We should go there again.

02:32.987 --> 02:34.029
That was a fun trip.

02:39.577 --> 02:41.704
So, what'd they say?

02:44.999 --> 02:46.458
Skye, who texted?

02:48.586 --> 02:49.628
Skye.

02:52.298 --> 02:53.632
Someone who knew you'd sleep in.

02:56.051 --> 02:57.052
Pinsky.

02:58.304 --> 02:59.972
Probably another intake briefing.

03:01.223 --> 03:02.224
Don't forget this.

03:15.154 --> 03:17.615
<i>A kid arrested
this morning, an Inhuman, of course,</i>

03:17.781 --> 03:20.743
<i>was grabbed ten feet
from a public market.</i>

03:20.910 --> 03:22.369
<i>Just imagine what he was planning.</i>

03:22.661 --> 03:24.038
<i>And I have it on good authority</i>

03:24.163 --> 03:25.915
<i>that someone was hiding this Inhuman.</i>

03:26.248 --> 03:28.500
<i>I hope this subversive
was strung up for treason.</i>

03:28.667 --> 03:30.127
<i>Unbelievable!</i>

03:31.253 --> 03:32.254
You're quiet.

03:33.214 --> 03:35.341
Are we okay? Or what?

03:35.883 --> 03:37.384
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

03:38.219 --> 03:39.261
I just, um...

03:47.478 --> 03:48.479
Oh, my God.

03:51.398 --> 03:53.943
Yeah, some mornings,
the Triskelion looks so beautiful.

04:02.660 --> 04:05.037
Come on. We're gonna be late.

04:08.457 --> 04:10.042
You can't do this!

04:10.167 --> 04:11.502
Sure we can, Inhuman!

04:12.002 --> 04:13.587
- Son of a...
- Hey!

04:14.046 --> 04:15.631
- Get him up.
- They can handle it on their own.

04:17.216 --> 04:18.259
Come on.

04:28.519 --> 04:29.478
What are you doing?

04:33.190 --> 04:34.900
You're on another planet
this morning.

04:36.443 --> 04:38.612
Look, I get it.

04:39.738 --> 04:42.283
You put yourself out there
last night and I let you down.

04:43.284 --> 04:44.285
I'm sorry.

04:46.620 --> 04:47.830
What are you apologising for?

04:49.248 --> 04:52.876
It's been a few years.
It makes sense to take this step.

04:53.502 --> 04:55.170
I would love to live with you.
It's just...

04:55.921 --> 04:56.922
it's not the right time.

04:58.257 --> 04:59.800
I asked you to move in?

05:01.593 --> 05:03.679
I, um, I mean, I did.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.015
And you're right, it's a bad idea.

05:06.181 --> 05:09.226
I just need some time,
some space.

05:10.936 --> 05:11.979
Skye...

05:14.023 --> 05:16.233
there are things about me
that you wouldn't like if you knew.

05:16.942 --> 05:18.444
Trust me. I know.

05:22.656 --> 05:23.699
Skye.

05:25.200 --> 05:26.243
Ward.

05:27.953 --> 05:28.954
It's that way.

05:31.540 --> 05:32.583
Kill me already.

05:35.878 --> 05:37.254
Hey,
you ever finish the Saunders report?

05:43.135 --> 05:43.927
Of course, you did.

05:45.888 --> 05:47.097
I'm gonna check my e-mail.

05:48.098 --> 05:50.225
Why? Anyone who's e-mailing you
is gonna be in the briefing.

05:50.976 --> 05:52.603
Yeah, that's why I want
to get caught up.

05:55.439 --> 05:56.440
Okay.

06:15.626 --> 06:16.835
"Died during testing."

06:18.128 --> 06:19.171
What did they do?

06:25.386 --> 06:27.137
No, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no.

06:29.223 --> 06:31.308
- It can't be.
- Can't be what?

06:32.935 --> 06:33.936
May.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.772
You're here. Are you okay?

06:37.773 --> 06:39.316
Are you okay? I came looking for you.

06:40.067 --> 06:43.112
- Could have started with the briefing.
- No, no, no, May, it's me.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.906
I... I got into the framework.

06:46.073 --> 06:49.243
- I don't care what you've hacked.
- May, look at me. It's me... it's D...

06:51.120 --> 06:52.871
Do I have to get you drug-tested?

06:53.497 --> 06:55.290
- Get in the briefing.
- Sorry.

06:56.625 --> 06:57.626
I'll come now.

07:24.653 --> 07:25.654
I was murdered.

07:32.035 --> 07:33.078
Ah!

08:10.616 --> 08:11.617
S.H.I.E.L.D. fell.

08:14.077 --> 08:16.079
Hey! Hey!

08:16.955 --> 08:17.956
Hey!

08:18.999 --> 08:20.584
- Are you okay?
- Thank you.

08:21.126 --> 08:22.711
I need help. Please.

08:23.253 --> 08:25.214
Okay. Yeah. Get in, get in.

08:30.761 --> 08:32.054
- I'm Jemma.
- I'm... I'm Julia.

08:32.221 --> 08:34.306
Uh. Where can I take you? DC?
Is that okay?

08:34.472 --> 08:35.557
Yes, thank you.

08:35.890 --> 08:37.142
- Anywhere but here.
- Yeah.

08:42.688 --> 08:45.275
That's a really dangerous area.
What were you doing there?

08:45.859 --> 08:48.612
I must look dreadful.
No, I'm... I'm fine. It's...

08:49.947 --> 08:52.366
- complicated.
- It's okay. I didn't...

08:54.117 --> 08:57.913
- Whatever happened, I didn't mean to push.
- Right. Yeah, well, best we don't.

09:00.374 --> 09:03.502
What about you? What are you into?

09:04.628 --> 09:06.171
Me? I'm boring.

09:06.797 --> 09:09.299
I wait tables for now.
But I make these.

09:09.967 --> 09:11.009
They're kind of cool.

09:11.760 --> 09:12.761
You make art?

09:13.387 --> 09:16.223
Fascinating. So incredibly lifelike.

09:17.432 --> 09:20.352
It's nothing special.
It's just side money for med school.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.855
- I always dreamed of helping people.
- You have dreams.

09:26.024 --> 09:27.150
This is all so real.

09:28.193 --> 09:29.945
So many computational layers.

09:35.409 --> 09:36.410
What's wrong?

09:37.369 --> 09:41.665
It's a new Inhuman checkpoint.
They take forever but it's worth it.

09:43.375 --> 09:46.795
They can test for Inhuman DNA,
pre-Terrigenesis?

09:47.296 --> 09:48.380
Don't they do that everywhere?

09:51.675 --> 09:54.720
I mean, it freaked me out the first time,
but they just check IDs here.

09:58.015 --> 09:59.850
I don't have one.
I must have lost it back there.

10:00.017 --> 10:02.060
No, no, no. You need... You need your ID.

10:02.811 --> 10:04.396
Like, you need it.

10:09.151 --> 10:12.404
I'm sorry, I don't... I don't have it.

10:12.529 --> 10:16.283
- Jemma, they're gonna arrest us.
- Well, okay. Well, okay, wait.

10:16.742 --> 10:18.577
Let's just... Oh, here we go.

10:21.246 --> 10:22.456
- You're S.H.I.E.L.D.
- No.

10:22.956 --> 10:25.876
- You're one of them.
- Wait. No, no, no. Listen.

10:26.001 --> 10:27.919
- You got to get out. You lied to me.
- No, no, please.

10:28.003 --> 10:29.338
- Please, please, don't...
- Get out! Get out!

10:29.421 --> 10:31.423
...I haven't lied to you I just need
to find my friend Daisy.

10:31.506 --> 10:33.592
- I'm sorry, okay? No, I'm sorry.
- Can I use your phone?

10:33.842 --> 10:35.093
- Please.
- I'm sorry!

10:35.260 --> 10:36.511
Just please close the door.

10:47.773 --> 10:48.899
I warned you not to be late.

10:50.484 --> 10:52.235
Shut up, Pinsky.

10:53.278 --> 10:54.321
Let's start.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.908
We've got an Inhuman
gene-positive detainee,

10:58.158 --> 10:59.993
possibly linked to subversive groups.

11:00.285 --> 11:02.037
The Doctor wants this fast-tracked.

11:04.498 --> 11:05.624
Don't disappoint him.

11:06.583 --> 11:09.503
Subject is Jason Rajan of Deanwood.

11:09.920 --> 11:12.839
We believe he's funnelling Terrigen
to subversives.

11:17.427 --> 11:18.553
Look who's perking up.

11:21.682 --> 11:22.683
You know this guy?

11:24.643 --> 11:26.478
- No.
- Then get to know him.

11:27.813 --> 11:28.897
You and Ward take point.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.485
I want this intel at any cost.

11:43.620 --> 11:45.664
You're in a very precarious position,

11:45.914 --> 11:46.915
Mr Rajan.

11:47.582 --> 11:49.209
Inhuman status isn't a crime.

11:50.252 --> 11:52.671
- But lying about it is.
- I never lied.

11:53.130 --> 11:54.214
We'll see about that.

11:54.923 --> 11:58.093
Hydra cares more about what you've done
than what you are.

11:59.761 --> 12:04.891
So when my partner here asks you
about smuggling charges...

12:06.101 --> 12:07.811
I highly suggest you cooperate.

12:18.780 --> 12:23.285
Your name is Jason Rajan,
born in Edison, New Jersey?

12:23.452 --> 12:24.494
Yes.

12:28.707 --> 12:31.042
Did you know that you were
an Inhuman before today?

12:31.710 --> 12:32.753
Yes.

12:33.962 --> 12:37.007
And it says that you own
an import business,

12:37.299 --> 12:40.260
<i>but Hydra surveillance says one
of your trucks is missing.</i>

12:41.344 --> 12:44.598
<i>- Where is it?
- I don't know. It was stolen.</i>

12:45.390 --> 12:47.893
Was stolen, but you didn't file
a police report.

12:48.101 --> 12:50.979
I'm an Inhuman. I was afraid
to talk to the authorities.

12:51.146 --> 12:53.732
What was stored in the truck, Mr Rajan?

12:55.025 --> 12:56.067
I don't know.

12:56.943 --> 12:58.862
I don't deal directly
with those kinds of shipments.

12:59.029 --> 13:01.323
Bull. Where is the truck?

13:02.574 --> 13:03.575
Forget about the truck.

13:03.742 --> 13:05.869
This guy's never seen Terrigen
before in his life.

13:10.248 --> 13:12.209
Hydra issued citizen's card.

13:13.168 --> 13:15.754
But I know for a fact
that your name isn't Jason Rajan,

13:15.921 --> 13:18.882
so I wonder, who made it?

13:21.134 --> 13:22.385
- It's not possible.
- Exactly.

13:22.636 --> 13:27.599
Unless someone within Hydra provided it.
I am trying to save your life.

13:28.266 --> 13:31.686
So, tell me,
is there a threat within Hydra?

13:31.853 --> 13:33.438
You never helped anyone, you bitch!

13:33.605 --> 13:35.440
Give me the Terrigen,
and I'll show you a threat.

13:35.607 --> 13:36.733
Someone in Hydra make this for you?

13:37.567 --> 13:39.653
Your name is Vijay Nadeer.

13:40.654 --> 13:41.738
Don't deny it.

13:42.864 --> 13:44.324
My DNA is not a crime.

13:45.200 --> 13:46.701
I'm not a criminal. You should know...

13:47.702 --> 13:49.162
Ward! What...

13:50.497 --> 13:51.498
At least we broke him.

14:20.277 --> 14:21.653
Not one smartphone.

14:36.793 --> 14:39.087
- Hey, come on. Really?
- It's not my fault.

14:48.054 --> 14:50.348
- Are you all right, ma'am?
- I'm great. Thank you.

14:51.016 --> 14:53.727
- Rough day?
- Oh, I was just hiking.

14:54.144 --> 14:55.562
I tripped. So clumsy.

14:56.855 --> 15:00.233
- Everything okay?
- Our friend here went hiking.

15:01.401 --> 15:02.402
Oh, yeah?

15:03.278 --> 15:04.446
In a dumpster or...?

15:04.738 --> 15:07.490
Well, that's not very nice.
No, I fell.

15:08.491 --> 15:11.620
- And I just want to get home.
- I'll need to see your ID.

15:12.454 --> 15:13.455
Yeah.

15:14.331 --> 15:15.373
Okay.

15:16.917 --> 15:17.959
Oh.

15:19.002 --> 15:21.421
I must have lost it in the fall,
I guess.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.465
Hmm. Come with us, please.

15:28.428 --> 15:29.763
Let's start with your name.

15:31.306 --> 15:32.307
Name?

15:33.099 --> 15:35.936
- Simmons. Jemma Simmons.
- You got that?

15:36.144 --> 15:37.187
Got it.

15:43.818 --> 15:45.654
You're lying about something.
I can see it.

15:46.696 --> 15:48.782
Based on what? My... my clothes?

15:49.199 --> 15:51.409
My accent? I told you, I lost my ID.

15:51.701 --> 15:53.578
It... it says here she's a dead girl.

15:53.912 --> 15:57.290
- False identification. Big trouble.
- But it's her picture.

16:11.346 --> 16:13.306
<i>This is a dangerous world.</i>

16:16.226 --> 16:17.644
The Cambridge incident proved that.

16:19.104 --> 16:21.481
To understand this, you have
to imagine individuals

16:21.648 --> 16:22.774
over the state.

16:23.233 --> 16:25.068
It was a mess. People were divided.

16:25.777 --> 16:29.364
They had their own truths,
their own media, their own agendas.

16:30.615 --> 16:31.992
There were so many untruths

16:32.200 --> 16:34.327
about Inhumans out there
that some people saw them

16:34.494 --> 16:37.622
as these magical, heroic creatures,
like unicorns.

16:37.872 --> 16:39.416
It was terrifying.

16:41.334 --> 16:45.588
Then, you had a weak state
that allowed a refugee from Bahrain,

16:46.172 --> 16:48.216
a girl, sympathetic.

16:48.675 --> 16:51.720
Even though S.H.I.E.L.D. knew
she was Inhuman,

16:52.387 --> 16:55.140
they brought her back to the States
and put her into a classroom.

16:56.141 --> 16:57.183
The rest is history.

16:59.102 --> 17:01.813
But what inspires me
is the way our country reacted,

17:02.355 --> 17:03.648
the way we came together.

17:03.898 --> 17:06.651
When no one would tell us the truth,
Hydra stepped forward.

17:07.609 --> 17:10.195
They brought us law and order, purpose.

17:10.864 --> 17:12.198
They galvanised us...

17:13.241 --> 17:16.118
for the good of the state
over individual interests.

17:16.286 --> 17:17.704
They... Yeah, Burnell.

17:18.079 --> 17:20.707
But, sir, isn't it true
that Hydra came from Nazis?

17:22.459 --> 17:24.377
That's not true. Never say that.

17:24.877 --> 17:27.380
Okay, but weren't they
the Nazis' science division?

17:28.006 --> 17:29.174
Anyone who's informed knows...

17:30.133 --> 17:32.135
that Hydra originated centuries ago.

17:32.635 --> 17:34.971
So they couldn't be Nazis.
That's just propaganda.

17:36.514 --> 17:37.348
But this is good.

17:39.100 --> 17:43.396
This shows how important it is to separate
fact from innuendo.

17:45.065 --> 17:48.485
Before the incident,
there were over 1,500 newspapers...

17:48.651 --> 17:49.694
...some of them...

17:50.487 --> 17:52.322
Mr Coulson? Sorry to interrupt.

17:53.156 --> 17:54.574
It's all right. How can I help you?

17:54.991 --> 17:56.576
Yeah, Chris Adler.

18:00.705 --> 18:03.500
- Chris?
- We're just gonna run a few tests.

18:12.133 --> 18:14.302
- Wait, Chris.
- Yes, Mr Coulson?

18:15.637 --> 18:16.679
Don't forget your bag, son.

18:25.105 --> 18:26.481
Oh. I'll take that.

18:33.446 --> 18:37.117
Okay. Let's get back to the lesson.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.872
You got quiet, Vijay.

18:43.957 --> 18:46.084
It's probably because of his broken jaw.

18:47.877 --> 18:48.878
No more games.

18:54.801 --> 18:55.802
You're her.

18:57.095 --> 18:59.347
- I know you.
- I doubt it.

19:00.807 --> 19:01.975
All Inhumans know you.

19:03.685 --> 19:04.727
Bahrain.

19:07.188 --> 19:09.482
It's funny,
'cause the world blame Inhumans

19:09.649 --> 19:10.650
for what happened.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.279
But it was you that got it wrong.

19:16.114 --> 19:18.700
May! May, don't do this.

19:19.617 --> 19:20.660
This isn't you.

19:23.163 --> 19:24.706
May, wake up!

19:27.250 --> 19:28.668
He's valuable to us.

19:31.337 --> 19:32.797
Take him upstairs for testing.

19:34.340 --> 19:35.341
Yes, ma'am.

19:35.800 --> 19:37.844
- The Doctor will get answers.
- No.

19:38.052 --> 19:39.429
- Just...
- Not him. No!

19:40.096 --> 19:41.848
- No! No!
- Come on!

19:43.349 --> 19:44.601
Not the Doctor, okay?

19:44.934 --> 19:47.395
I... I'll talk! All right, you're right!

19:47.562 --> 19:49.814
- All right? The ID was real.
- Shut up, shut up, shut up.

19:50.732 --> 19:52.525
What did you mean
when you were talking to Agent May?

19:52.692 --> 19:54.194
The Bahrain op was a success.

19:55.486 --> 19:59.782
- God, you have a sick measure of success.
- I'm sorry if she killed an Inhuman child,

20:00.283 --> 20:02.118
but if it saved everyone else...

20:02.368 --> 20:03.786
If that girl had been taken down
in Bahrain,

20:03.953 --> 20:06.122
she wouldn't have gone on to kill
all those people in Cambridge.

20:06.497 --> 20:07.749
Thanks to your friend back there,

20:08.041 --> 20:10.460
Hydra has a green light
to exterminate Inhumans.

20:11.461 --> 20:13.588
Okay. Listen, I know you don't trust me,

20:13.796 --> 20:15.798
- but I can help you get out of here.
- Oh, really?

20:16.466 --> 20:18.301
You should avoid saying that
under the cameras.

20:22.180 --> 20:23.640
Ah! Vijay!

20:26.726 --> 20:27.727
Vijay!

20:35.652 --> 20:36.986
We have him, Doctor.

20:43.576 --> 20:44.953
Fitz.

20:54.254 --> 20:55.505
You lost control of the prisoner.

20:59.968 --> 21:01.636
I would've caught him.

21:02.637 --> 21:03.680
Follow me.

21:31.457 --> 21:33.710
Thank goodness.

21:41.342 --> 21:43.136
Oh. Come on, Daisy.

21:44.637 --> 21:45.638
Come on.

22:47.033 --> 22:49.243
There you are, sir. I'm coming.

22:55.541 --> 22:57.043
- Coulson.
- Yes?

22:59.545 --> 23:01.714
It's so, so good to see you, sir.

23:02.090 --> 23:03.549
I'm sorry. Have we met? Are you...

23:04.926 --> 23:06.219
Please don't say
you were a student.

23:06.803 --> 23:08.262
Oh, you don't remember me, do you?

23:08.930 --> 23:11.808
Um. I'm Jemma. It's Jemma...
Jemma Simmons, sir.

23:12.016 --> 23:13.851
It's been such a horrible day
and when I saw

23:13.976 --> 23:15.311
- where you were, I hoped that you...
- Horrible?

23:15.436 --> 23:17.021
Did something happen?
Should I call someone?

23:17.188 --> 23:19.899
No, please don't call anyone.
I just need to talk to you.

23:20.441 --> 23:22.819
I don't understand.
When did you say we met?

23:23.069 --> 23:24.112
In the real world.

23:26.531 --> 23:27.907
Before you were ever a teacher.

23:29.659 --> 23:31.202
Unless you count summers life-guarding,

23:31.702 --> 23:33.746
- I've always been a teacher.
- You see, you think that.

23:33.996 --> 23:35.915
You think that you were, but no.
It's...

23:37.083 --> 23:39.919
Oh, there's no sane way to say it,
so...

23:41.212 --> 23:44.424
Do you have moments
where reality isn't quite right?

23:44.590 --> 23:46.217
Like your memories don't fit?

23:48.678 --> 23:50.179
- Who are you?
- Simmons.

23:51.973 --> 23:55.726
I know I sound like a lunatic,
but you have had your mind wiped

23:55.977 --> 23:58.813
- and implanted with false memories.
- Okay. It's time to leave.

23:59.021 --> 24:01.107
No, please, you... you need
to hear this.

24:01.816 --> 24:03.109
I am an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

24:03.317 --> 24:05.862
You were the director of S.H.I.E.L.D.
You destroyed Hydra.

24:06.028 --> 24:08.865
And now you're... you're trapped
in a virtual prison,

24:09.031 --> 24:10.700
and I am here to wake you up.

24:10.867 --> 24:12.493
Put that away before we both get arrested.

24:12.827 --> 24:15.079
What is this? Is this a test?
Because it's not gonna work.

24:15.371 --> 24:16.956
I'm loyal to Hydra. I'm just a teacher.

24:17.123 --> 24:20.251
Yes, you are a teacher!
You are a teacher and...

24:20.460 --> 24:22.211
and a leader and...

24:22.378 --> 24:25.965
Oh, you're a great man
and you shouldn't be here!

24:28.885 --> 24:30.094
I have no way to prove it.

24:31.387 --> 24:32.597
Not yet. I need to...

24:33.890 --> 24:36.225
- I need to go back...
- Please, get yourself some help.

24:36.517 --> 24:38.436
And whatever you do,
don't talk about S.H.I.E.L.D.

24:38.603 --> 24:39.645
Tahiti.

24:42.815 --> 24:45.526
- No. No, that's Hawaiian.
- Remember Tahiti.

24:49.530 --> 24:50.740
It's a magical place.

24:51.782 --> 24:54.577
- Why did you say that?
- It's a magical place.

24:55.661 --> 24:58.623
This isn't an accident.
Your memory's been rewritten before!

24:58.789 --> 25:00.291
You are Phil Coulson, agent
of S.H.I.E.L.D.,

25:00.458 --> 25:02.001
and your subconscious knows that!

25:02.251 --> 25:04.420
- You need to go.
- You need to remember me!

25:04.795 --> 25:08.216
And Fitz and Agent May
and all the good that we have done.

25:08.382 --> 25:12.053
Your friends depend on you
and this world is a lie!

25:12.220 --> 25:14.222
I have tried to be nice to you
but that's enough!

25:14.514 --> 25:16.641
I don't know you. Now leave.

25:20.144 --> 25:21.979
Okay. I'll go.

25:25.816 --> 25:27.485
But I am not giving up on you, sir.

25:53.386 --> 25:55.263
Yes, I'd like to report a subversive.

26:02.770 --> 26:03.771
Hey!

26:05.147 --> 26:06.148
What are you doing?

26:07.775 --> 26:10.403
You tagged my car.
I can't drive this now.

26:11.654 --> 26:13.990
- I didn't tag it.
- You're holding the can.

26:14.782 --> 26:17.618
What can? I... I mean,
that's how Hydra does it, right?

26:18.202 --> 26:20.413
You and Mr Coulson, I mean,
you all lie to us every day.

26:21.122 --> 26:22.832
You know,
that Hydra isn't a bunch of Nazis,

26:23.040 --> 26:24.834
and... and that you don't steal kids
out of school?

26:25.334 --> 26:26.460
You think I'm Hydra.

26:26.919 --> 26:29.255
I saw you talking to Coulson.
And where's Chris?

26:29.714 --> 26:30.965
You know, go ahead.
Take me to him.

26:31.299 --> 26:32.633
'Cause if not, I'm gonna find
the Resistance

26:32.800 --> 26:35.303
- and come after all of you.
- I don't ha... Ah.

26:36.804 --> 26:40.933
You're not even real, you rogue piece
of code! This is... this is all fake!

26:41.267 --> 26:42.685
It's a virtual world.

26:45.980 --> 26:47.023
I don't mean that.

26:48.149 --> 26:50.901
Look at me. Do I look like I'm Hydra?

26:52.361 --> 26:53.571
You look like a bag lady.

26:56.907 --> 26:57.908
I'm Jemma.

26:59.243 --> 27:00.620
Coulson let Hydra take your friend?

27:02.204 --> 27:03.205
Damn.

27:04.790 --> 27:06.417
You know,
Coulson used to fight Hydra.

27:07.251 --> 27:09.295
He was as brave as you
and got into more trouble,

27:09.587 --> 27:11.839
and even trained me well enough
to steal this car.

27:13.549 --> 27:15.676
Coulson? You're crazy.

27:18.596 --> 27:20.389
Look, I mean, they're definitely
gonna stop you now.

27:22.433 --> 27:23.893
Well, have at it.

27:24.769 --> 27:26.145
And for the record, Hydra?

27:27.021 --> 27:28.022
They're all Nazis.

27:31.025 --> 27:32.026
Hey.

27:32.902 --> 27:36.739
Look... I trashed your car.
You can borrow mine.

27:37.657 --> 27:39.742
- You're sure?
- Are Hydra all Nazis?

27:40.242 --> 27:41.285
Every last one of them.

27:41.869 --> 27:43.412
And don't you let anyone forget it.

28:02.223 --> 28:04.183
Now, with this machine,
we can test Inhuman powers

28:04.350 --> 28:05.434
without any side effects.

28:06.769 --> 28:09.188
It seems like it's burning him.

28:09.897 --> 28:10.940
There are side effects.

28:11.691 --> 28:14.652
Well, yes. I meant, we can determine
their powers

28:14.819 --> 28:17.863
without permanently triggering
Terrigenesis in the subject.

28:19.407 --> 28:22.368
- We'll change the world.
- Fitz, this is wrong.

28:23.035 --> 28:26.288
This... this
is crimes-against-humanity wrong.

28:26.455 --> 28:28.624
These are Inhumans.

28:30.835 --> 28:33.587
You've been a great asset, Skye,
but unless I ask for your opinion...

28:34.380 --> 28:35.423
don't give it.

28:45.015 --> 28:46.517
How are things going with Grant Ward?

28:51.605 --> 28:53.774
- They're good.
- I noticed your application

28:53.941 --> 28:55.735
for co-habitation had been approved.

28:57.486 --> 28:58.529
Yes.

29:01.449 --> 29:03.784
Sir, there's a report you need
to see.

29:04.201 --> 29:07.830
Subversive activity at a school,
a woman with a S.H.I.E.L.D. ID.

29:07.997 --> 29:08.998
Really?

29:09.165 --> 29:13.669
The report was called in
by a teacher, Phillip Coulson.

29:15.629 --> 29:18.340
- Who's the girl?
- Suspect was in her mid-20s,

29:19.008 --> 29:20.593
- British.
- Did you get her name?

29:20.968 --> 29:22.386
Where was this?

29:23.345 --> 29:24.346
You can go.

29:30.978 --> 29:33.105
I want any and all assets
in the area on this.

29:40.446 --> 29:43.157
Hey.

29:43.783 --> 29:44.992
What's up? We get a call?

29:45.618 --> 29:47.328
No, I just have some stuff to do.

29:47.995 --> 29:49.288
Stuff. Really?

29:50.414 --> 29:51.665
Skye, you never leave early.

29:53.292 --> 29:55.586
You've been pissed at me all morning.
Your attitude at work here sucks.

29:55.753 --> 29:57.713
It's like I woke up
to a totally different person.

29:59.006 --> 30:00.549
You know what? You're right.
I'm pissed.

30:00.925 --> 30:02.510
I tried to get closer to you
in our relationship,

30:02.593 --> 30:04.762
and you shut me down
because you said you needed space.

30:06.555 --> 30:10.184
Fine. Take all the space you need,
but right now, I need my own.

31:15.791 --> 31:16.876
It's a magical place.

31:29.471 --> 31:30.556
No.

31:41.150 --> 31:42.443
- Daisy!
- Jemma!

31:42.902 --> 31:45.404
- Oh. Ah!
- Oh, I was so worried.

31:46.655 --> 31:47.698
Wait. You're Hydra?

31:47.907 --> 31:50.284
It's a long story.
I saw that you were dead.

31:51.535 --> 31:53.787
- Wait. Are you still dead?
- No, I'm feeling much better.

31:53.954 --> 31:55.039
- So you're okay.
- Yeah.

31:55.247 --> 31:56.832
You were supposed to be buried
in the UK.

31:56.999 --> 31:58.417
More like a mass grave
at the Academy.

31:58.584 --> 32:01.086
The story's a cover-up. I think
Hydra murdered me.

32:01.837 --> 32:04.673
- Did you find the extraction beacon?
- Exactly where we programmed it.

32:05.007 --> 32:06.842
Okay. We have to get out of here.
Hydra is after you.

32:07.009 --> 32:09.136
- We have to get somewhere safe.
- What?

32:10.054 --> 32:11.263
Coulson gave me up, didn't he?

32:11.639 --> 32:13.432
He's completely different, Daisy.
You wouldn't believe it.

32:13.599 --> 32:15.184
He let Hydra arrest a child.

32:15.351 --> 32:17.811
May's different, too.
She's like number three in Hydra

32:18.062 --> 32:19.980
and way more damaged
than in the real world.

32:20.147 --> 32:22.024
Everything's worse here.
I woke up buried alive,

32:22.191 --> 32:23.734
was ditched on the side of the road,
nearly arrested

32:23.901 --> 32:25.444
and found Coulson
brainwashing the young.

32:25.653 --> 32:27.571
It sounds bad but wait
till you hear how I woke up.

32:27.738 --> 32:30.616
Why did Radcliffe build this place?
He was never into Hydra.

32:30.824 --> 32:32.618
Ladies.

32:34.036 --> 32:35.287
Ward.

32:36.080 --> 32:37.581
We need to talk.

32:40.584 --> 32:43.087
How did you know my name?
Who are you?

32:43.921 --> 32:46.548
- Skye, what have you told her?
- So, it's Skye again.

32:47.883 --> 32:50.219
- You have another name?
- No. I'm Skye.

32:50.427 --> 32:51.470
Why's Hydra after her?

32:52.429 --> 32:53.722
Is she your source in the Resistance?

32:53.889 --> 32:56.308
- What source? No, she's a friend.
- What is he doing here?

32:56.475 --> 32:58.477
All right, let's go!
Down this trail!

32:58.852 --> 33:00.354
Daisy, they're coming. You need
to do something

33:00.521 --> 33:03.983
- before psycho stalker shoots us!
- Stop it! Stop it! Ward, look at me.

33:04.233 --> 33:05.901
I have never betrayed you, ever.

33:11.991 --> 33:12.992
We're real.

33:13.742 --> 33:15.828
Is she your source for the Resistance?

33:15.995 --> 33:17.496
- No!
- No! Ward, I have nothing to do

33:17.663 --> 33:19.206
- with the Resistance!
- Over here.

33:22.793 --> 33:23.794
Well, I do.

33:24.670 --> 33:26.046
Come on. We got to get out of here.

33:26.171 --> 33:28.257
Use lethal force if necessary!

33:28.424 --> 33:29.508
We got move, now!

33:30.009 --> 33:31.260
- Whose car is this?
- Mine.

33:31.468 --> 33:32.803
- Keys, now!
- What? No!

33:32.970 --> 33:35.472
Keys, or we all die!

33:36.515 --> 33:38.308
- What the hell is going on?
- I've no idea.

33:55.034 --> 33:56.452
Skye, there's no good way
to tell you this,

33:56.827 --> 34:00.497
but I had the test results when you
were screened. You're an Inhuman.

34:01.290 --> 34:03.375
- I know.
- You know?

34:16.722 --> 34:17.806
Cover us!

34:20.851 --> 34:23.937
So, you're Hydra,
and you've been protecting Skye?

34:24.772 --> 34:26.148
Yeah. That's why I joined
the Resistance.

34:26.732 --> 34:29.025
Oh, always the double agent.
And this is who you woke up with?

34:29.193 --> 34:30.319
You two were together?

34:31.235 --> 34:33.280
Oh, this isn't the Framework.
This is Hell.

34:34.447 --> 34:36.241
They're gaining on us!

34:45.583 --> 34:46.877
How did you know
Vijay Nadeer's real name?

34:47.210 --> 34:50.339
- Why do you care?
- I was the one who got his ID cards.

34:51.297 --> 34:53.050
- You're a mole?
- What a surprise.

34:53.217 --> 34:54.592
You knocked him out to shut him up.

34:54.760 --> 34:56.303
Yeah. He was helpful until you burned him.

34:58.138 --> 35:01.350
Hold on!

35:06.772 --> 35:09.858
- What are you doing? We'll get stuck.
- Drones will be here any second.

35:10.901 --> 35:12.069
- Drones?
- Dwarfs,

35:12.236 --> 35:14.071
whatever. The Doctor invented them.
They're everywhere.

35:23.038 --> 35:24.331
Metro's just up those steps.

35:24.748 --> 35:26.708
Two stops to your apartment.
You'll be safe there.

35:29.711 --> 35:31.088
I'll clear the car. Go, go, go.

35:34.007 --> 35:35.050
Ward...

35:35.717 --> 35:37.845
I'm sorry about Vijay. I got caught up,

35:38.011 --> 35:40.722
and I... I had to give May something.
I didn't know it could be you.

35:42.724 --> 35:43.767
What is your name?

35:45.018 --> 35:46.061
Daisy.

35:47.646 --> 35:49.565
We'll talk. Get out of here.

35:51.024 --> 35:52.025
Go.

35:56.405 --> 35:59.950
One agent was killed. The others lost
the vehicle in Bethesda.

36:00.409 --> 36:01.702
We're canvassing the area.

36:03.120 --> 36:07.207
- It was one girl.
- One girl with help, who knew our tactics.

36:07.791 --> 36:09.251
Maybe whoever helped her...

36:10.794 --> 36:13.630
also made this. It's not a forgery.

36:14.923 --> 36:15.966
A mole.

36:20.220 --> 36:21.471
Well, that's a serious charge.

36:22.181 --> 36:23.557
Someone is betraying us.

36:24.808 --> 36:26.268
You know, my father always said...

36:27.269 --> 36:30.272
you have to have trust to be betrayed.

36:34.276 --> 36:35.694
Treat this mole like a cancer.

36:37.446 --> 36:38.739
I'll cut it out myself.

36:39.531 --> 36:40.782
Well, you failed before.

36:46.330 --> 36:48.123
Never forget how it felt at Cambridge.

36:52.377 --> 36:53.795
Did the dwarfs record these people?

36:56.924 --> 36:59.176
The footage was sent straight
to the director...

37:00.719 --> 37:01.762
by request.

37:03.263 --> 37:04.806
<i>You saw Fitz, didn't you?</i>

37:05.265 --> 37:07.309
Is he like the others? Brainwashed?

37:10.103 --> 37:12.189
Yeah, he was different.

37:14.650 --> 37:17.653
But, Simmons, they all are.
It's scary.

37:18.862 --> 37:21.198
Why change things like this?
It makes no sense.

37:21.323 --> 37:24.076
Radcliffe tried to take away
people's pain in the Framework.

37:25.327 --> 37:26.787
Wait. You're right.

37:27.663 --> 37:30.666
May's biggest pain was killing
the girl in Bahrain.

37:30.999 --> 37:33.961
You take that away and hundreds
of kids are killed in Boston.

37:34.127 --> 37:37.422
And Coulson is leading a quiet life.
I'm worried he's not the same man.

37:38.173 --> 37:39.633
He really let them take a kid?

37:41.760 --> 37:45.097
And what did they do to Fitz
to make him such an ugly person here?

37:45.847 --> 37:48.850
Well, that one's easy. They stole you
from his life.

37:55.274 --> 37:56.650
What if he never knew me?

37:57.943 --> 38:01.029
What if he can't remember? This...
This reality is flawless.

38:01.196 --> 38:02.656
- It lures you in.
- I know, I know.

38:02.823 --> 38:04.408
Can't even believe
what I found myself doing.

38:04.950 --> 38:05.951
I...

38:06.785 --> 38:07.828
I looked up Lincoln.

38:08.412 --> 38:11.957
I... I interrogated Vijay for being
an Inhuman.

38:12.165 --> 38:13.250
And I have been here one day.

38:13.834 --> 38:15.627
May's been here weeks.
She thinks it's her whole life.

38:16.253 --> 38:18.255
A few choices and a few lives.

38:18.547 --> 38:22.050
Radcliffe ran a simulation.
Now it's a brave new terrifying world.

38:25.095 --> 38:26.221
Okay. Um...

38:27.556 --> 38:28.557
We need to get out.

38:30.475 --> 38:32.853
What? N... No, we can't leave them.

38:33.228 --> 38:36.481
We have to talk to Yo-Yo,
and come back with a game plan,

38:36.648 --> 38:38.525
with backup. I don't have powers here.

38:41.069 --> 38:42.070
Okay.

38:52.748 --> 38:53.749
Why are we still here?

38:55.000 --> 38:56.043
I'm not sure.

38:56.251 --> 38:58.837
This should disconnect us
from the Framework, wake us up.

39:03.467 --> 39:04.468
They know we're here.

39:07.220 --> 39:08.263
You're supposed to be dead.

39:09.181 --> 39:11.641
- Someone re-coded our exit.
- We're trapped.

39:16.563 --> 39:17.647
Good evening, Madame.

39:20.067 --> 39:22.319
Leopold. Come in.

39:25.072 --> 39:28.909
These subversives need
to be taken seriously.

39:29.743 --> 39:31.453
Apparently, they've got a mole
inside Hydra.

39:33.038 --> 39:34.039
A traitor.

39:34.748 --> 39:37.292
I know. I've tightened security.

39:38.919 --> 39:40.879
Eliminated a loophole
for their escape.

39:44.132 --> 39:45.342
Next, we tighten the noose.

39:51.223 --> 39:52.849
So, you have surveillance on then?

39:55.102 --> 39:56.353
On one of them, yes.

39:56.978 --> 39:58.438
- I'd like to see it.
- No.

39:59.398 --> 40:02.818
Your work is too important
to be distracted by these criminals.

40:03.527 --> 40:08.407
I won't stand by, as they try to destroy
everything that we have built.

40:11.493 --> 40:12.869
I have to protect that.

40:13.370 --> 40:15.831
I have to protect you. I have...

40:19.167 --> 40:21.545
Your anger won't solve this.

40:22.254 --> 40:25.382
It's your creativity that we need.

40:59.458 --> 41:00.459
Hey.

41:03.086 --> 41:04.087
Who are you?

41:04.880 --> 41:07.257
Are you with the other person?
This is not okay.

41:09.426 --> 41:10.469
Coulson...

41:11.511 --> 41:14.681
- I need you to remember me.
- I'm sorry. We haven't met.

41:15.390 --> 41:16.433
We have.

41:17.225 --> 41:20.979
- Please, remember me.
- No. This isn't real.

41:21.188 --> 41:24.065
- You're not here.
- I am. I am.

41:24.733 --> 41:27.360
Please. Remember me.

41:34.618 --> 41:36.536
I'm sorry. I don't.

41:42.083 --> 41:43.084
It's not your fault.

41:44.711 --> 41:45.712
It's just...

41:46.296 --> 41:49.591
you're the person that I go to
when things get heavy.

41:51.051 --> 41:56.389
And this world is scary
and nothing makes sense, and...

41:58.058 --> 41:59.643
you're the closest thing I have to family.

42:04.064 --> 42:06.566
So, I just hope that deep down,
you feel it, too.

42:14.616 --> 42:15.617
Daisy?
