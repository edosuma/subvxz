00:32.198 --> 00:34.063
The Kol-Ut-Shan...

00:34.167 --> 00:38.001
a cornerstone of our beliefs.

00:38.104 --> 00:41.335
lnfinite diversity
in infinite combinations.

00:41.408 --> 00:44.605
l know all about
Vulcan philosophies.

00:44.677 --> 00:46.406
Why have you come here?

00:46.479 --> 00:49.175
l was sent against my will.

00:49.249 --> 00:52.150
Then l suggest you leave.

00:52.218 --> 00:54.015
l'm not a prisoner?

00:54.087 --> 00:55.577
Only of your emotions

00:55.655 --> 00:58.351
or so l have been told.

00:58.425 --> 01:00.791
My emotions free me.

01:00.860 --> 01:02.760
l see.

01:02.829 --> 01:06.890
lt's regrettable that l won't
be able to teach you.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.059
Where should l go?

01:09.169 --> 01:11.637
Are you seeking my counsel?

01:11.738 --> 01:15.538
l... can't return home.

01:15.608 --> 01:17.940
My father has banished me.

01:18.011 --> 01:19.444
Your school?

01:19.512 --> 01:20.945
They revoked my seat.

01:21.014 --> 01:22.811
Why?

01:22.882 --> 01:25.942
Because l refuse
to deny myself passion,

01:26.019 --> 01:29.386
the way you
and men like my father do.

01:29.456 --> 01:31.321
You reject logic?

01:31.391 --> 01:33.325
lf l was meant
to deny feelings,

01:33.393 --> 01:35.293
why was l born with them?

01:35.361 --> 01:36.988
Where's the logic in that?

01:38.064 --> 01:41.465
Hidden for you to find...

01:41.568 --> 01:45.402
or in plain sight
for you to ignore.

01:45.472 --> 01:47.872
You speak in riddles
because the truth frightens you.

01:47.941 --> 01:48.873
You're right.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.603
lt does frighten me.

01:50.677 --> 01:52.872
You are surprised

01:52.946 --> 01:56.848
to hear a Vulcan master admit
to having emotions?

01:56.916 --> 01:58.349
Yes.

01:58.418 --> 02:01.353
Emotions can be
a powerful tool.

02:01.421 --> 02:04.288
To deny their existence
is illogical,

02:04.357 --> 02:07.656
but you must learn
to control them.

02:07.727 --> 02:09.490
Why?

02:10.964 --> 02:13.194
Do you wish to be taught?

02:16.436 --> 02:19.496
l would question
everything you say.

02:19.606 --> 02:23.337
You would not be
a worthy pupil otherwise.

02:24.410 --> 02:26.275
Let us begin.

02:26.346 --> 02:28.780
Sit down, Tuvok.

06:51.944 --> 06:54.071
Tun beveg!

06:54.147 --> 06:55.079
Uh, sorry?

06:55.148 --> 06:58.447
Senn... nebah senn?

06:58.518 --> 07:01.851
Either the universal
translator's off-line

07:01.921 --> 07:04.014
or l hit my head
harder than l thought.

07:04.090 --> 07:05.148
Ruck.

07:05.224 --> 07:06.156
All right.

07:06.225 --> 07:07.192
Take it easy.

07:08.227 --> 07:09.990
All right, all right.

07:10.062 --> 07:11.188
Take it easy.

07:11.264 --> 07:12.322
Fitah!

07:12.398 --> 07:15.629
This?

07:15.735 --> 07:17.464
Listen, l really need this.

07:17.570 --> 07:18.696
Fitah! Ud neetot!

07:18.805 --> 07:20.568
Okay, okay.

07:39.725 --> 07:43.161
First day in town
and l've already been mugged.

08:14.160 --> 08:14.922
Ah.

08:55.535 --> 08:59.494
l'm Commander Tuvok
of the Starship Voyager.

09:03.442 --> 09:04.704
Tuvok.

09:06.112 --> 09:07.579
Tuvok.

09:07.647 --> 09:10.115
Yes.

09:10.182 --> 09:11.376
And you?

09:12.451 --> 09:13.884
Noss.

09:14.954 --> 09:16.148
Noss.

09:28.467 --> 09:31.197
We'll go to my vessel.

09:38.711 --> 09:41.179
l see you've already been there.

09:43.049 --> 09:44.744
Mayday, Mayday.

09:44.817 --> 09:47.615
Paris to Voyager.
Respond.

09:48.721 --> 09:49.847
Aw, come on.

09:54.226 --> 09:56.023
Her name is Noss.

09:56.095 --> 09:58.290
She was attacked
by two humanoid males.

09:59.532 --> 10:01.625
You sure she didn't attack them?

10:01.701 --> 10:03.566
They were attempting
to rob her.

10:03.669 --> 10:06.365
Seems to be a local pastime.

10:23.823 --> 10:25.791
She requires medical attention.

10:25.858 --> 10:29.954
l'd love to help,
but somebody stole our medkits.

10:38.437 --> 10:39.904
Food.

10:42.808 --> 10:45.538
What's the status
of the shuttle?

10:45.611 --> 10:47.579
Fractures throughout the hull,

10:47.647 --> 10:49.547
environmental systems down,

10:49.615 --> 10:52.550
impulse engines
are beyond repair.

10:52.618 --> 10:55.416
Told you we should have
brought the Delta Flyer.

10:57.289 --> 10:59.154
Communications appear
to be functional.

10:59.225 --> 11:01.090
Won't do us any good.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.752
Every time
l transmit a signal,

11:02.828 --> 11:05.160
it gets bounced back
by the distortion field

11:05.231 --> 11:06.630
that pulled us down here.

11:08.868 --> 11:12.304
lt looks like we fell into
some kind of gravity well.

11:12.371 --> 11:13.895
As far as l can tell,

11:14.040 --> 11:16.804
this planet is a part
of an entire solar system

11:16.876 --> 11:19.208
that is stuck
in a pocket of subspace.

11:19.278 --> 11:20.472
Fascinating.

11:20.546 --> 11:22.741
Yeah.

11:22.815 --> 11:24.339
Well, scientific
interest aside,

11:24.417 --> 11:26.180
l don't see any
easy way out of here.

11:26.252 --> 11:28.948
No doubt Voyager
has begun a rescue effort.

11:29.055 --> 11:30.249
The Doctor?

11:30.322 --> 11:32.119
His mobile emitter was
damaged during the crash.

11:32.191 --> 11:33.488
With a little luck,
l might be able

11:33.559 --> 11:35.083
to repair it and bring
him back on line.

11:35.161 --> 11:37.095
Make it your top priority.

11:37.163 --> 11:38.824
Gren, gren.

11:38.898 --> 11:40.559
What is it?

11:41.934 --> 11:44.061
13 humanoids approaching...

11:44.170 --> 11:46.638
the same species
that attacked her.

11:46.706 --> 11:48.833
Gather as many supplies
as you can carry.

11:48.941 --> 11:50.203
We're leaving.

11:50.276 --> 11:52.369
You really think it's smart
to abandon the shuttle?

11:52.445 --> 11:54.709
Noss appears to have survived
here for some time.

11:54.780 --> 11:56.213
lt's logical to assume

11:56.282 --> 11:58.147
she has access
to a more secure shelter.

11:58.217 --> 12:00.082
Nemmok. Eilen.

12:00.152 --> 12:01.744
Eilen.

12:01.821 --> 12:04.312
Whatever you say.

12:32.151 --> 12:34.176
Eid kahn.

13:10.156 --> 13:13.319
Doesn't look like this bird's
going to fly, either.

13:13.392 --> 13:15.553
Minimal power
and life-support,

13:15.628 --> 13:18.654
but the ship is protected
by a force field.

13:18.731 --> 13:21.894
That explains how
she's been able to survive here.

13:22.034 --> 13:23.899
Anything resembling
an engine?

13:24.003 --> 13:26.904
l'm detecting engine debris
two kilometers away.

13:26.972 --> 13:29.770
lt is of the same
configuration as this vessel.

13:29.842 --> 13:31.309
Great.

13:31.377 --> 13:33.641
We've got two unusable ships,
and the only way

13:33.712 --> 13:36.078
Voyager is going
to detect our distress call

13:36.148 --> 13:38.275
is if they crash-land
right on top of us.

13:38.350 --> 13:39.942
Progress?

13:40.019 --> 13:43.887
The optronic relays
took heavy damage.

13:43.956 --> 13:47.722
l'm bypassing
the primary circuits.

13:47.793 --> 13:49.226
Come on, Doc.

13:49.295 --> 13:51.855
l know you're in there.

13:55.267 --> 13:56.825
l'm guessing we hit a snag.

13:56.936 --> 13:58.426
An accurate assumption.

14:01.373 --> 14:02.397
Rev din ud?

14:03.776 --> 14:04.606
Ud rev?

14:04.677 --> 14:06.110
Tun sang.

14:06.178 --> 14:08.305
Ton rev ud tim seid.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.343
You speak her language?

14:11.417 --> 14:15.319
A universal translator
was written into my program.

14:15.387 --> 14:17.480
Ask her how long
she's been here,

14:17.556 --> 14:18.716
if she knows a way

14:18.791 --> 14:20.986
to get back through
that sinkhole.

14:21.060 --> 14:25.053
Din yee ton ud lurka?

14:25.130 --> 14:28.588
Pah din nefta menruk?

14:28.701 --> 14:30.191
Lurka heen.

14:30.302 --> 14:32.998
Zin ik lurka

14:33.105 --> 14:35.266
ud ruck totta.

14:35.374 --> 14:38.343
Mah'ees bin ruck ayah.

14:39.411 --> 14:41.208
What'd she say?

14:41.280 --> 14:45.649
She said she's been here
14 seasons

14:45.718 --> 14:48.778
and in that time, she's seen
many ships come down,

14:48.854 --> 14:51.516
but she's never seen one
go back up again.

15:20.552 --> 15:22.486
Come back,
you little bloodsucker.

15:23.956 --> 15:25.253
l don't know what's worse--

15:25.324 --> 15:26.848
catching them or eating them.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.291
No poison.

15:28.360 --> 15:30.055
Well, they may not
be poisonous,

15:30.129 --> 15:32.063
but they give me the creeps.

15:32.131 --> 15:34.691
Maybe l should have
left the hunting

15:34.767 --> 15:35.734
to you and Tuvok.

15:35.801 --> 15:36.995
Let me.

15:53.319 --> 15:56.220
Looks delicious.

16:03.929 --> 16:05.590
Shut down my program?

16:05.664 --> 16:06.926
Why?

16:06.999 --> 16:08.626
Our resources are
severely limited.

16:08.701 --> 16:10.794
We may need your mobile emitter
as a source of power.

16:10.903 --> 16:12.530
l'm a Doctor, not a battery.

16:12.638 --> 16:13.605
Until we're rescued

16:13.672 --> 16:15.139
or you're needed
for an emergency,

16:15.240 --> 16:17.265
l must insist
that you remain off-line.

16:17.376 --> 16:20.106
Make way for the mighty hunters.

16:20.179 --> 16:24.206
lf Mr. Paris' hunting ability
is any indication,

16:24.283 --> 16:26.012
maybe we should
take him off-line.

16:26.085 --> 16:28.610
Thanks for the vote
of confidence, Doc.

16:28.687 --> 16:30.052
The hunt was good.

16:32.124 --> 16:34.149
lmpressive.

16:35.294 --> 16:37.592
Voyager has 15 decks,

16:37.663 --> 16:39.130
a crew of 152,

16:39.198 --> 16:41.860
warp and impulse engines.

16:41.934 --> 16:44.425
l want to see.

16:44.503 --> 16:46.198
Someday, perhaps.

16:48.140 --> 16:50.802
Tell me about you there.

16:50.876 --> 16:53.003
l am the Chief Tactical Officer.

16:55.681 --> 16:57.876
What else?

16:57.950 --> 17:00.418
Can you be more specific?

17:00.486 --> 17:03.649
Your duties, uh...

17:03.722 --> 17:06.555
Where you sleep?

17:06.625 --> 17:08.148
What you eat?

17:08.227 --> 17:09.819
Music?

17:09.895 --> 17:11.226
Friends?

17:11.296 --> 17:13.730
Why is any of that relevant?

17:15.099 --> 17:17.568
Because it is you.

17:20.839 --> 17:24.297
When l first met her,
she wouldn't even look at me,

17:24.410 --> 17:27.503
but she warmed up after,
oh... three years.

17:27.579 --> 17:30.639
The longest flirtation
in Starfleet history.

17:30.716 --> 17:32.775
No kidding.

17:32.851 --> 17:36.218
She sounds... fascinating.

17:36.288 --> 17:38.483
l just hope l see her again.

17:38.557 --> 17:40.525
You must really...

17:43.996 --> 17:45.793
bot yah jouton.

17:47.633 --> 17:49.328
Love her very much.

17:51.670 --> 17:53.331
Yeah.

17:58.844 --> 18:01.210
More spiders?

18:01.280 --> 18:03.373
Oh, no, thank you.

18:03.449 --> 18:05.542
Three's my limit.

18:05.617 --> 18:07.107
l will assist you.

18:10.589 --> 18:14.685
Well, l suppose it's time
l shut down my program.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.557
Good night, Doc.

18:34.613 --> 18:36.274
She likes you.

18:36.348 --> 18:38.873
She has been alone
for many years.

18:39.017 --> 18:41.178
She appreciates our company.

18:42.654 --> 18:47.284
No. l mean...
she likes you.

18:48.360 --> 18:50.123
What are you implying?

18:50.195 --> 18:51.423
Oh, come on, Tuvok.

18:51.497 --> 18:54.022
You may be cold,
but you're not blind.

18:54.099 --> 18:57.330
Need l remind you
that l am married?

18:57.436 --> 18:59.870
Your wife is
50,000 light-years away

18:59.938 --> 19:01.462
in a different layer of space.

19:01.573 --> 19:03.803
The chances of you ever
seeing her again

19:03.876 --> 19:05.400
are practically nonexistent.

19:07.379 --> 19:08.778
Excuse me.

19:21.627 --> 19:24.152
What are you doing?

19:24.229 --> 19:26.493
l'm recalibrating
the distress beacon.

19:28.333 --> 19:29.766
Listen, um...

19:29.868 --> 19:33.497
what l said in there
about your wife--

19:33.605 --> 19:35.072
l'm sorry.

19:35.140 --> 19:37.267
l didn't mean
to hurt your feelings.

19:37.342 --> 19:39.276
l have no feelings
for you to hurt.

19:42.214 --> 19:43.613
l think you do.

19:43.682 --> 19:46.048
You work hard to bury them,

19:46.118 --> 19:47.881
but they're there.

19:50.522 --> 19:52.888
And even if they're not,

19:52.958 --> 19:56.325
this is home now.

19:56.395 --> 19:58.886
You might as well accept it
and try to find

19:58.964 --> 20:00.363
as much happiness as you can.

20:02.701 --> 20:04.293
Listen, you have a chance

20:04.403 --> 20:07.031
to make a decent life
for yourself here.

20:07.139 --> 20:10.404
There is still a possibility
that Voyager will rescue us.

20:10.475 --> 20:12.602
You may see
Lieutenant Torres again.

20:12.678 --> 20:14.771
lf l didn't know you better,

20:14.846 --> 20:18.577
l'd say you were trying
to cheer me up, Tuvok.

20:18.650 --> 20:21.175
ls there a point
to your pessimism?

20:21.253 --> 20:22.379
lt's not pessimism.

20:22.454 --> 20:23.546
lt's practicality.

20:23.622 --> 20:26.113
You of all people
should understand that.

20:28.393 --> 20:30.224
Look, l've never
met your wife,

20:30.295 --> 20:32.695
but if she's half
as logical as you are,

20:32.764 --> 20:35.289
l bet you she'd tell
you the same thing.

20:37.803 --> 20:40.636
Your attempt to play
matchmaker is misguided.

20:40.706 --> 20:42.674
l am not experiencing
Pon farr.

20:42.741 --> 20:44.299
What difference does it make?

20:44.409 --> 20:46.206
You obviously care about Noss.

20:46.278 --> 20:49.509
lf you won't admit it to me,
at least admit it to yourself.

20:49.581 --> 20:53.244
l respect her ability
to survive.

20:53.318 --> 20:55.013
lt's more than that.

20:55.120 --> 20:58.021
l've seen the way
you look at her.

20:58.090 --> 20:59.387
What way is that?

21:00.626 --> 21:04.027
Like someone who wishes
he wasn't Vulcan.

21:14.139 --> 21:15.572
l'm sorry l was born Vulcan.

21:15.641 --> 21:17.802
B'Elak paar.

21:17.876 --> 21:20.140
Self-pity.

21:20.212 --> 21:22.612
Are you cataloging
my emotions?

21:22.681 --> 21:24.740
What is the source
of your self-pity?

21:24.816 --> 21:25.908
lsn't it obvious?

21:25.984 --> 21:28.282
lf l weren't Vulcan,
l wouldn't be here now,

21:28.353 --> 21:30.378
going through
this pointless ritual.

21:30.455 --> 21:33.322
You see only what
is in front of you.

21:33.392 --> 21:35.952
You must learn
to see behind you.

21:36.028 --> 21:37.154
Another riddle.

21:37.229 --> 21:39.493
l have no eyes to see behind me.

21:39.564 --> 21:41.555
You have the eyes of memory,

21:41.633 --> 21:43.965
the knowledge
of why you are here

21:44.136 --> 21:46.331
and why you have lost control.

21:51.109 --> 21:52.599
Tell me your story.

21:53.712 --> 21:55.771
My father's
already explained it.

21:55.847 --> 21:58.543
l wish to hear it from you.

22:02.321 --> 22:03.811
Her name is Jara.

22:03.889 --> 22:06.756
Her father's
a Terrelian diplomat.

22:06.825 --> 22:09.487
She's been granted
a seat at my school.

22:09.561 --> 22:11.085
And you have developed

22:11.163 --> 22:13.529
an emotional attraction
toward her.

22:13.598 --> 22:15.361
Yes.

22:15.434 --> 22:16.696
You love her.

22:16.802 --> 22:18.030
Yes.

22:18.136 --> 22:20.001
Does she love you?

22:22.341 --> 22:24.138
No. She's...

22:26.078 --> 22:30.777
Jara... doesn't return
my feelings.

22:30.849 --> 22:34.785
What if l were to say
that l received a letter

22:34.853 --> 22:38.880
from your father telling me
that Jara is in love

22:38.957 --> 22:41.187
with one
of your fellow students?

22:41.259 --> 22:42.385
That's a lie!

22:43.729 --> 22:45.094
Who is it?

22:45.163 --> 22:46.790
Jealousy?

22:46.865 --> 22:48.389
l'll challenge him.

22:48.467 --> 22:50.458
That would be illogical,

22:50.569 --> 22:53.766
because l have received
no such letter.

22:55.841 --> 22:58.002
You're trying to trick me.

22:58.143 --> 23:01.601
No. l'm trying to help
you to understand.

23:01.680 --> 23:03.773
Shon-ha'lock-- love--

23:03.849 --> 23:06.875
is the most dangerous
emotion of all.

23:07.018 --> 23:09.782
lt produces
many other emotions--

23:09.855 --> 23:14.315
jealousy, shame, rage, grief.

23:14.393 --> 23:17.590
You must learn
to suppress them all.

23:17.662 --> 23:20.631
Otherwise, they will
consume you.

23:23.201 --> 23:27.331
l can sense emotions
building inside you

23:27.439 --> 23:29.873
like a gathering storm.

23:29.941 --> 23:34.844
lf we begin now,
we may be able to stop them.

23:43.655 --> 23:45.555
Captain's Log, supplemental.

23:45.624 --> 23:47.114
lt's been over an hour

23:47.192 --> 23:50.161
since the shuttle
disappeared from sensors.

23:50.228 --> 23:52.594
l'm not detecting any debris.

23:52.664 --> 23:55.258
Maybe the shuttle was tractored
or transported somewhere.

23:55.333 --> 23:56.322
Scan the region.

23:56.435 --> 23:58.562
Look for plasma emissions
or EM displacements--

23:58.670 --> 24:00.433
anything that might
indicate another ship.

24:00.539 --> 24:01.801
Nothing out of the ordinary--

24:01.840 --> 24:03.307
hydrogen, helium, space dust.

24:03.375 --> 24:04.535
There has to be
something out there.

24:04.609 --> 24:07.169
Shuttles don't just vanish
into thin air.

24:08.246 --> 24:10.146
lt's a gravimetric shear.

24:10.215 --> 24:11.147
Source?

24:11.216 --> 24:12.148
Unknown.

24:12.217 --> 24:13.149
Red Alert.

24:13.218 --> 24:15.118
Helm, full ahead.

24:21.693 --> 24:24.526
We're caught in some kind
of subspace sinkhole.

24:24.596 --> 24:26.029
lt's pulling us in.

24:27.098 --> 24:29.191
The gravimetric shear's
increasing.

24:29.301 --> 24:30.199
Go to warp.

24:30.302 --> 24:32.327
l can't establish
a stable field.

24:32.437 --> 24:34.803
Then we need more power
to the impulse engines.

24:34.873 --> 24:35.897
That won't be enough.

24:36.074 --> 24:37.939
We've got to find a way to
counter the gravitational pull.

24:38.043 --> 24:39.135
B'Elanna, vent

24:39.211 --> 24:40.940
three million isodynes of plasma
from the nacelles.

24:41.012 --> 24:43.344
Chakotay, reverse
shield polarity.

24:49.688 --> 24:50.712
We're clear.

24:50.789 --> 24:51.756
Move us away.

24:51.823 --> 24:53.347
Stand down Red Alert.

24:53.425 --> 24:55.017
Secure all stations.

24:57.095 --> 24:59.120
l'd say we have
a pretty good idea

24:59.197 --> 25:00.892
what happened to that shuttle.

25:01.032 --> 25:04.763
The anomaly is approximately
600 meters in diameter.

25:04.870 --> 25:06.565
lt's out of phase
with normal space.

25:06.671 --> 25:08.468
Even after recalibrating
the sensors,

25:08.540 --> 25:09.802
it barely registers.

25:09.875 --> 25:13.402
The distortion circumscribes
a subspace zone that includes

25:13.478 --> 25:15.207
a type-G sun and three planets.

25:15.280 --> 25:17.407
Any sign of the shuttle?

25:17.482 --> 25:19.313
No.

25:19.384 --> 25:21.875
l'd say it's time to break out
the multispatial probe.

25:21.987 --> 25:23.545
Agreed.

25:23.622 --> 25:25.180
What the hell is that?

25:25.257 --> 25:27.851
A vessel approaching
off the port bow.

25:27.926 --> 25:29.894
They've locked on
a tractor beam.

25:29.961 --> 25:32.191
Captain to the Bridge.

25:36.334 --> 25:38.461
l'm only going
to say this one more time.

25:38.570 --> 25:40.197
Disengage
your tractor beam, sir.

25:40.305 --> 25:42.899
You were in danger
of being pulled

25:43.008 --> 25:44.669
into the distortion.

25:44.743 --> 25:47.473
You should show
a little gratitude.

25:47.546 --> 25:50.379
We appreciate your help,
but we didn't ask for...

25:52.951 --> 25:55.715
Captain, this is Mr. Yost.

25:55.787 --> 26:00.520
Supervisor Yost,
Renovation Team Nova.

26:00.592 --> 26:03.527
Captain Janeway
of the Starship Voyager.

26:03.595 --> 26:05.927
Until tomorrow,
l suggest you stay

26:05.997 --> 26:09.592
at least two million kilometers
from the distortion.

26:09.668 --> 26:11.067
What happens tomorrow?

26:11.169 --> 26:13.694
The rift will be closed by then.

26:13.805 --> 26:16.273
Some of our crew
are trapped inside.

26:16.374 --> 26:17.568
l am sorry.

26:17.642 --> 26:21.874
We have lost 1 1 ships
to the distortion

26:21.980 --> 26:23.413
over the last year.

26:23.481 --> 26:24.880
lt must be sealed.

26:24.983 --> 26:27.110
What about your people?

26:27.185 --> 26:30.746
Even if there were survivors,
there's no way to rescue them.

26:30.822 --> 26:32.380
The best we can do

26:32.457 --> 26:34.891
is to prevent others
from being trapped.

26:34.993 --> 26:36.688
We can't abandon our crew.

26:36.761 --> 26:38.820
lf you could delay
your mission...

26:38.897 --> 26:43.425
My orders are to seal the rift
by this time tomorrow.

26:43.535 --> 26:47.471
lf you want to attempt a rescue
between now and then,

26:47.572 --> 26:52.509
the risk is yours to take,
but l wouldn't advise it.

26:54.212 --> 26:55.144
Launch the probe.

26:55.213 --> 26:56.202
Aye, Captain.

26:56.281 --> 26:58.272
Work with B'Elanna and Seven
to enhance the sensors.

26:58.350 --> 26:59.942
Do whatever you can
to find Tom and Tuvok.

27:00.018 --> 27:01.042
l'll be looking for a way

27:01.086 --> 27:02.678
to counter
those gravitational forces.

27:09.027 --> 27:09.994
Come in.

27:11.496 --> 27:12.827
l've been brushing up

27:12.931 --> 27:14.831
on sinkholes,
quantum singularities.

27:14.966 --> 27:16.092
Any luck?

27:16.201 --> 27:18.431
All the data leads me
to the same conclusion.

27:18.536 --> 27:20.197
They're mono-directional
phenomena--

27:20.305 --> 27:21.704
what goes in doesn't come out.

27:21.773 --> 27:22.967
Well, if it's any consolation,

27:23.041 --> 27:24.668
something's coming out
of that anomaly.

27:24.743 --> 27:25.675
What is it?

27:25.744 --> 27:26.870
Telemetry from our probe.

27:26.945 --> 27:28.845
We've located
the shuttle's distress beacon

27:28.913 --> 27:30.710
on a Class-D planet.

27:30.782 --> 27:33.216
Vulcan, human, alien life signs.

27:33.284 --> 27:35.752
At least we know they're alive.

27:35.820 --> 27:37.879
Keep reading.

27:42.861 --> 27:46.262
There's astronomical data here
covering a three-month period.

27:46.331 --> 27:47.559
How is that possible?

27:47.632 --> 27:50.499
There seems to be some sort
of temporal differential.

27:50.602 --> 27:52.229
How big a differential?

27:52.337 --> 27:53.634
lt's difficult to say,

27:53.705 --> 27:55.764
but every hour
that passes for us

27:55.874 --> 27:58.866
could mean weeks, even months
for Tom and Tuvok.

27:58.977 --> 28:01.309
Months trying to survive
in a Class-D environment?

28:01.413 --> 28:03.381
And more than likely,
they've assumed

28:03.415 --> 28:05.246
that we left them behind
long ago.

28:05.316 --> 28:06.578
Ready for the bad news?

28:06.651 --> 28:07.675
You're kidding.

28:07.752 --> 28:10.016
The gravitational stress
is increasing.

28:10.088 --> 28:13.387
Seven believes the sinkhole
is on the verge of collapse.

28:13.458 --> 28:16.291
When it does, everything inside
will be crushed.

28:30.608 --> 28:32.576
Noss!

28:43.521 --> 28:45.648
Medical tricorder.

28:47.058 --> 28:48.491
We were ambushed.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.824
Give me 20 milligrams
of inaprovaline.

28:50.895 --> 28:52.988
They got away with a pair of
resonator coils that we found.

28:53.064 --> 28:54.224
Three fractured ribs,

28:54.299 --> 28:57.063
subdural hematoma,
internal bleeding.

28:57.168 --> 28:58.157
Will he live?

28:58.269 --> 28:59.463
Vulcans are very resilient.

28:59.571 --> 29:00.469
He'll be fine.

29:03.208 --> 29:06.644
How long has it been
since l was last activated?

29:06.745 --> 29:07.973
Almost two months.

29:08.046 --> 29:09.536
Two months?!

29:12.383 --> 29:14.817
So... what's new?

29:14.919 --> 29:16.443
Oh, same old thing--

29:16.521 --> 29:19.922
fighting off scavengers,
hunting spiders...

29:19.991 --> 29:21.686
No word from Voyager?.

29:21.760 --> 29:25.526
They're probably 300 light-years
closer to home by now.

29:25.597 --> 29:27.827
l think
l should remain on-line

29:27.966 --> 29:30.560
until Mr. Tuvok
is fully recovered.

29:32.804 --> 29:35.671
lt's good to have you back, Doc.

29:51.156 --> 29:52.748
Rest.

29:54.292 --> 29:56.556
How long was l unconscious?

29:56.628 --> 29:58.687
Too many hours.

29:58.763 --> 30:01.197
Mr. Paris?

30:01.266 --> 30:02.392
He'll be fine.

30:04.669 --> 30:08.571
l was afraid.

30:08.640 --> 30:11.700
lt is good to see your eyes.

30:19.083 --> 30:20.482
Don't.

30:23.688 --> 30:28.421
l only want...
to show you how l feel.

30:36.835 --> 30:41.499
You... you-you feel
nothing for me?

30:41.606 --> 30:43.301
l told you,

30:43.374 --> 30:46.673
l don't experience emotion.

30:46.744 --> 30:52.580
l have developed an appreciation
and respect for you--

30:52.650 --> 30:54.618
nothing more.

31:00.158 --> 31:01.557
Nothing?

31:02.894 --> 31:04.327
l am sorry.

31:04.395 --> 31:07.228
l cannot return your affection.

31:09.634 --> 31:11.465
You cannot

31:11.569 --> 31:13.230
or you will not?

31:14.706 --> 31:16.139
A minor distinction.

31:16.207 --> 31:17.572
Logic!

31:17.642 --> 31:19.075
l hate logic!

31:19.143 --> 31:23.512
Your emotions will only
exacerbate the situation.

31:23.581 --> 31:25.071
Shevrot kat!

31:25.149 --> 31:27.845
lnsulting me will not help.

31:27.919 --> 31:29.682
Derot oraht!

31:40.498 --> 31:41.965
We can use
the multispatial probe

31:42.100 --> 31:43.260
as a transporter relay.

31:43.368 --> 31:44.392
lt'll take a little time

31:44.502 --> 31:46.129
to reconfigure
the targeting scanners,

31:46.237 --> 31:47.670
but, with a little luck,
it should work.

31:47.739 --> 31:49.229
Any reason we can't
use the same relay

31:49.340 --> 31:51.205
to send a com signal?

31:51.276 --> 31:52.675
l don't see why not.

31:52.744 --> 31:54.974
Good. Let them know
that help is on the way.

31:55.046 --> 31:57.037
Captain to the Bridge.

32:01.519 --> 32:03.282
They've started
ahead of schedule.

32:03.354 --> 32:04.378
Hail them.

32:04.455 --> 32:05.387
Yes?

32:05.456 --> 32:06.582
lt was my understanding

32:06.658 --> 32:08.819
you wouldn't begin
for another six hours.

32:08.893 --> 32:10.292
We're ready now.

32:10.361 --> 32:11.328
Well, we're not.

32:11.396 --> 32:12.886
We need at least
another two hours

32:12.964 --> 32:14.454
to make a rescue attempt.

32:14.532 --> 32:15.897
l'm sorry.

32:16.067 --> 32:18.160
How long
until they seal the rift?

32:18.269 --> 32:20.601
Approximately 30 minutes.

32:20.672 --> 32:22.196
Then that's all we've got.

32:34.018 --> 32:35.451
Tuvok?

32:37.855 --> 32:39.117
Hey!

32:39.190 --> 32:41.283
l am meditating, Mr. Paris.

32:41.359 --> 32:42.951
l don't care.

32:43.027 --> 32:45.086
l trust there is
an urgent reason

32:45.163 --> 32:46.926
for your lack of courtesy.

32:46.998 --> 32:48.966
You're damn right there is.

32:49.100 --> 32:50.897
What did you say to her?

32:51.002 --> 32:53.732
Our conversation was private.

32:53.838 --> 32:57.296
Well, whatever you said,
she's talking about leaving,

32:57.408 --> 32:58.875
going off by herself,

32:58.943 --> 33:01.571
because it's too painful
to be around you.

33:01.679 --> 33:05.581
She is under the influence
of unfettered emotions.

33:05.616 --> 33:10.679
Well, maybe you're able
to ''fetter'' your emotions,

33:10.755 --> 33:12.882
but the rest of us
don't have that luxury.

33:12.957 --> 33:15.448
She is a living,
breathing woman,

33:15.526 --> 33:18.051
who, for reasons that
l can't begin to fathom,

33:18.129 --> 33:20.097
has fallen in love with you.

33:20.164 --> 33:23.031
Now, if you're incapable
of returning her feelings,

33:23.134 --> 33:25.102
at least show her
some compassion.

33:25.203 --> 33:26.568
Try to let her down easy.

33:26.637 --> 33:30.164
There is no easy way
to recover from infatuation.

33:30.274 --> 33:31.741
Oh, really?

33:31.843 --> 33:35.836
And what do you know
about infatuation?

33:35.913 --> 33:37.881
More than you might imagine.

33:37.949 --> 33:39.246
Enlighten me.

33:39.317 --> 33:41.444
l have no intention
of continuing

33:41.519 --> 33:43.384
this conversation any further.

33:43.454 --> 33:44.785
Come on, Tuvok.

33:44.856 --> 33:46.221
Come on!

33:46.290 --> 33:50.090
lt's just you, me and the rocks.

33:59.504 --> 34:02.598
When l was a young man,
l experienced

34:02.707 --> 34:06.143
an emotional attraction
toward a woman.

34:06.210 --> 34:08.235
lt nearly destroyed me.

34:08.312 --> 34:10.576
Your wife?

34:10.648 --> 34:11.978
No.

34:12.050 --> 34:16.453
Her name was Jara,
a Terrelian female.

34:16.521 --> 34:18.250
l would have violated

34:18.322 --> 34:23.089
every tenet of Vulcan philosophy
simply to be near her.

34:24.462 --> 34:26.793
She must have
really been something.

34:26.864 --> 34:30.356
l lost all sense of who l was.

34:31.969 --> 34:34.027
The emotional attraction
l felt for her

34:34.138 --> 34:37.505
became a kind of... insanity.

34:37.574 --> 34:41.875
Tuvok, everyone feels
a little insane

34:41.946 --> 34:44.608
when they fall in love...

34:44.681 --> 34:47.206
but it's worth the risk.

34:47.284 --> 34:49.219
For you, perhaps,

34:49.286 --> 34:51.380
but l am Vulcan.

34:51.456 --> 34:55.755
My natural emotions
are erratic, volatile.

34:55.827 --> 35:00.127
lf l don't control them,
they will control me.

35:04.235 --> 35:06.795
Whatever happened to Jara?

35:06.904 --> 35:09.031
l chose to leave her.

35:09.140 --> 35:12.109
l spent several
months in isolation,

35:12.176 --> 35:14.701
studying with a Vulcan master.

35:14.779 --> 35:17.714
l learned to suppress
my emotions.

35:25.857 --> 35:27.154
Too bad.

35:33.865 --> 35:35.389
Gravimetric distortions.

35:35.466 --> 35:36.797
What's causing them?

35:36.901 --> 35:38.061
Unknown.

35:49.614 --> 35:51.741
No response to our hails,
Captain.

35:51.816 --> 35:53.374
At this rate,
their anti-graviton beam

35:53.451 --> 35:56.113
will seal the distortion
in approximately 29 minutes.

35:56.187 --> 35:57.882
Transporter status?

35:57.955 --> 35:59.388
l've completed
the reconfiguration,

35:59.457 --> 36:00.890
but we're only going
to be able to relay

36:01.025 --> 36:02.617
one transporter beam
through the probe.

36:02.693 --> 36:04.024
We'll have to get Tom
and Tuvok

36:04.095 --> 36:06.393
within a two-meter radius
of their distress beacon.

36:06.464 --> 36:07.590
Harry?

36:09.033 --> 36:10.557
l've opened a channel.

36:10.668 --> 36:13.296
Voyager to away team.

36:17.441 --> 36:18.408
What is it?

36:18.476 --> 36:19.408
The distress beacon.

36:19.477 --> 36:20.603
We're receiving a transmission.

36:20.678 --> 36:23.078
Can you route it through
your com system?

36:27.618 --> 36:30.109
lf l'm right, this message

36:30.188 --> 36:33.214
was sent almost nine hours ago
on a very slow carrier wave.

36:33.291 --> 36:35.088
Can you speed it up?

36:35.159 --> 36:37.059
l'll try.

36:37.128 --> 36:46.264
Voy-a-ger... to... away team.

36:46.370 --> 36:49.032
A transporter beam
with a radius of two meters

36:49.140 --> 36:50.471
will activate
at the coordinates

36:50.541 --> 36:53.032
of your distress beacon
in exactly 30 minutes.

36:53.144 --> 36:54.236
''30 minutes''?

36:54.312 --> 36:56.439
That would have been
over eight hours ago.

36:56.514 --> 36:57.947
Shh. There's more.

36:58.082 --> 37:00.573
Be advised we've detected
a temporal differential

37:00.685 --> 37:02.050
between our two positions.

37:02.086 --> 37:05.544
According to our calculations,
the differential ratio

37:05.623 --> 37:08.683
is .47 44 seconds per minute.

37:08.759 --> 37:11.819
Repeat: Voyager to away team.

37:11.929 --> 37:14.420
A transporter beam
with a radius of two meters...

37:14.498 --> 37:17.956
According to that formula,
30 minutes would translate

37:18.069 --> 37:20.503
to two days, 1 1 hours
and 47 seconds.

37:20.571 --> 37:22.505
Well, we've waited this long.

37:22.573 --> 37:24.234
Tom.

37:48.466 --> 37:50.297
The force field is holding.

37:51.769 --> 37:53.361
Not for long
if they keep pelting us

37:53.471 --> 37:54.961
with these photon grenades.

37:56.440 --> 37:57.771
How are we supposed
to hold them off

37:57.842 --> 37:58.774
for two more days?

38:04.181 --> 38:06.809
The rift will be sealed
in less than two minutes.

38:06.884 --> 38:08.579
Move us into range.

38:08.653 --> 38:10.746
Stand by for transport.

38:10.821 --> 38:11.788
Yes, ma'am.

38:11.856 --> 38:13.380
The force field is losing power.

38:13.457 --> 38:14.651
Time?

38:14.725 --> 38:17.216
We still have another
hour before transport.

38:18.763 --> 38:19.957
Where are you going?

38:20.031 --> 38:22.465
To repair the field generator.

38:22.533 --> 38:24.433
l will accompany you.

38:24.535 --> 38:25.502
No. You stay.

38:25.569 --> 38:27.298
Prepare for the attack.

38:27.405 --> 38:28.963
You can't go alone.

38:29.073 --> 38:32.873
Risking two lives...
would be illogical.

38:37.548 --> 38:39.709
We're in transporter range.

38:39.784 --> 38:43.447
Link up with the probe
and relay the signal.

38:43.521 --> 38:44.715
Stand by.

38:44.789 --> 38:47.622
l've got a lock on their beacon.

38:47.692 --> 38:49.853
They're supposed to be ready
for transport in 32 seconds.

38:49.927 --> 38:51.895
Let's hope
they don't stand us up.

38:51.962 --> 38:55.090
Begin 20-second countdown
on my mark.

38:55.166 --> 38:56.656
Now.

38:57.935 --> 39:00.130
We've got less
than ten minutes to transport.

39:00.237 --> 39:01.465
Where the hell is Noss?!

39:01.572 --> 39:03.699
l'll find her.

39:18.189 --> 39:20.089
15 seconds.

39:20.157 --> 39:21.249
fourteen...

39:21.325 --> 39:22.690
thirteen...

39:34.505 --> 39:35.494
Tuvok...

39:35.606 --> 39:38.268
l could not leave you behind.

39:43.581 --> 39:44.809
Nine...

39:44.882 --> 39:46.315
eight...

39:46.384 --> 39:47.749
seven...

39:47.818 --> 39:49.479
Now, Mr. Paris!

40:01.866 --> 40:03.493
Hurry.

40:06.871 --> 40:08.338
Four...

40:08.406 --> 40:10.340
three...

40:10.408 --> 40:11.466
two...

40:11.575 --> 40:13.702
lnitialize transport sequence.

40:13.778 --> 40:15.075
Energize.

40:21.919 --> 40:23.784
We've got them.

40:26.557 --> 40:28.184
Welcome back.

40:28.259 --> 40:29.783
Who...?

40:29.860 --> 40:31.851
A friend.

40:38.602 --> 40:45.269
Commander Tuvok,
Personal Log, Stardate 52438.9.

40:45.342 --> 40:47.936
We are en route
to Noss' homeworld.

40:48.012 --> 40:51.311
As l prepare to say good-bye,
l find myself experiencing

40:51.382 --> 40:53.247
a certain discomfort.

40:53.317 --> 40:55.308
Tuvok.

40:57.354 --> 40:59.015
Weird day.

40:59.089 --> 41:00.556
Problems?

41:00.658 --> 41:02.319
l've spent the last two months

41:02.359 --> 41:04.691
wondering if l'd ever
see B'Elanna again.

41:04.762 --> 41:08.528
As far as she's concerned,
it's only been two days.

41:08.599 --> 41:10.897
l guess l expected her
to have missed me, too.

41:11.068 --> 41:12.899
Were it not
for the time differential,

41:13.070 --> 41:14.799
l'm sure she would
have experienced

41:14.905 --> 41:15.894
a deep sense of loss.

41:16.073 --> 41:18.473
You know something?

41:18.542 --> 41:19.531
l always thought

41:19.643 --> 41:21.907
that beneath
that cold Vulcan exterior

41:21.979 --> 41:26.416
lay a... even colder
Vulcan interior,

41:26.484 --> 41:30.944
but now, l'm convinced
you're a hopeless romantic.

41:31.021 --> 41:34.422
There is no need
to insult me, Mr. Paris.

41:34.492 --> 41:36.460
Oh, here they are now.

41:36.527 --> 41:39.621
l was just getting Noss' recipe
for sautéed spiders.

41:39.697 --> 41:42.257
She told me
how much you enjoyed them.

41:42.333 --> 41:44.961
Let's just say
it's an acquired taste.

41:47.204 --> 41:48.865
Good-bye, Tom.

41:55.212 --> 41:56.679
Thank you.

42:00.117 --> 42:02.881
Come on, Neelix.

42:02.953 --> 42:03.885
Oh. Of course.

42:03.954 --> 42:04.978
Crewman.

42:13.330 --> 42:14.627
l'm sorry.

42:14.698 --> 42:17.997
For what?

42:18.102 --> 42:23.506
l know how difficult
this was for you...

42:23.574 --> 42:27.601
for us.

42:27.678 --> 42:30.272
l just wish things
had been different.

42:30.347 --> 42:33.043
As do l.

43:04.548 --> 43:06.038
l understand.

43:09.653 --> 43:11.382
Thank you.

43:39.416 --> 43:42.112
Live long and prosper, Noss.

43:44.788 --> 43:48.053
You, too.

44:19.823 --> 44:22.690
lnfinite diversity...

44:22.760 --> 44:26.321
ln infinite combinations.

44:28.232 --> 44:30.757
Your training is now complete.

44:30.868 --> 44:32.460
You have done well.

44:33.570 --> 44:35.538
Thank you.

44:35.606 --> 44:38.632
You are now prepared to return
to the world.

44:38.742 --> 44:42.143
Grief, anger, fear
and especially love,

44:42.212 --> 44:45.204
will never threaten you again.

44:46.283 --> 44:50.276
l am... grateful.
