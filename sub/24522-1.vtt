[instrumental music]

00:38.386 --> 00:41.215
[music continues]

01:14.030 --> 01:15.597
[Bill]
Michael Jackson was my client

01:15.727 --> 01:17.555
and he became my friend.

01:17.686 --> 01:19.688
This is our story.

01:23.605 --> 01:25.955
[Green]
Mr. Whitefield, tell us more
about what you do.

01:27.565 --> 01:28.914
[sighs]

01:30.525 --> 01:33.223
People see us on TV
in our black suits and--

01:33.354 --> 01:34.572
Excuse me, could you speak

01:34.703 --> 01:36.313
into the microphone?

01:40.491 --> 01:42.232
[clears throat]

01:42.363 --> 01:45.844
People see us on TV in...our
black suits and..

01:45.975 --> 01:49.631
...think we're...
glorified bouncers.

01:49.761 --> 01:51.589
But executive protection

01:51.720 --> 01:54.288
is serious business.

01:54.418 --> 01:57.769
We're entrusted with
the welfare of celebrities

01:57.900 --> 02:00.337
their spouses, children.

02:00.468 --> 02:02.644
We set up false identities
to move people

02:02.774 --> 02:05.777
around the globe in secret.

02:05.908 --> 02:07.866
And when we leave

02:07.997 --> 02:10.520
if we've done our jobs right

02:10.651 --> 02:13.002
it's like we were never there.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.135
But we're always there.

02:15.265 --> 02:17.659
Standing in the background..

02:17.789 --> 02:21.053
...listening, observing.

02:21.184 --> 02:23.012
We know the things
you wish you knew.

02:25.275 --> 02:28.060
Mr. Whitefield,
the purpose of this deposition

02:28.191 --> 02:30.628
is to determine
if Dr. Conrad Murray

02:30.759 --> 02:33.240
'killed Michael Jackson.'

02:33.370 --> 02:35.416
Like I told you,
I wasn't there that night.

02:35.546 --> 02:39.724
But you were there the two years
leading up to that night.

02:39.855 --> 02:41.378
May I remind you
you're under oath?

02:41.509 --> 02:42.814
[sighs]

02:47.079 --> 02:48.603
Now..

02:48.733 --> 02:52.172
When did you start
working for Mr. Jackson?

02:52.302 --> 02:54.217
Just before Christmas, 2006.

02:56.785 --> 03:00.441
Z-Y-G-O-T-E-S.

03:00.571 --> 03:02.921
Seven letters
on a triple-word score.

03:03.052 --> 03:05.576
One hundred and ten points.
I win.

03:05.707 --> 03:09.101
What is Z-Z-Zygota,
that's not even a word.

03:09.232 --> 03:10.407
Yeah, it is.

03:10.538 --> 03:12.148
- Good job, baby.
- Thank you.

03:12.279 --> 03:13.932
Did you just get better
while I was away

03:14.063 --> 03:16.196
or am I just gettin' rusty?

03:16.326 --> 03:17.762
Me and aunty
played every night.

03:17.893 --> 03:19.460
- 'Sure did.'
- Mm-hm.

03:19.590 --> 03:21.723
And she beat me
just like that every time.

03:21.853 --> 03:23.377
- Okay.
- 'Mm-hm.'

03:23.507 --> 03:26.380
- So what else did I miss?
- I got a boyfriend.

03:26.510 --> 03:28.817
- What?
- Just foolin', pops.

03:28.947 --> 03:30.384
You better be.

03:30.514 --> 03:32.821
'Cause I told you,
no boyfriends until you 20.

03:32.951 --> 03:34.257
You said 16.

03:34.388 --> 03:36.520
- Well, I meant 25.
- Oh, come on.

03:36.651 --> 03:39.219
[laughing]

03:39.349 --> 03:41.003
- So, daddy.
- Yes?

03:41.133 --> 03:43.962
Are you really gonna be
home for Christmas?

03:46.095 --> 03:47.705
Of course.

03:47.836 --> 03:49.185
That's tight.

03:49.316 --> 03:50.839
[chuckles]
Oh.

03:50.969 --> 03:51.796
[cell phone buzzing]

03:51.927 --> 03:53.537
Oh, okay.

03:53.668 --> 03:55.626
Hey, Jeff, what's up?

03:55.757 --> 03:57.541
Hey, I got a job for you.

03:57.672 --> 03:59.282
I'm not leavin' home.

03:59.413 --> 04:00.631
[Jeff]
'No, it's here in Vegas.'

04:00.762 --> 04:03.112
High profile dignitary.

04:03.243 --> 04:06.202
Arrives in two weeks, I just
need you to escort him home.

04:06.333 --> 04:08.248
Okay. A to B?

04:08.378 --> 04:10.815
A to B.
And I'll handle the rest.

04:10.946 --> 04:13.514
Alright, short and sweet.
I'm in.

04:16.212 --> 04:19.868
Now let's get back
to this boyfriendsituation.

04:19.998 --> 04:22.479
[Bill]
Two days before
the client was to arrive

04:22.610 --> 04:25.003
Jeff and I did what's known
as a pre-advance detail.

04:25.134 --> 04:26.527
Video camera.

04:26.657 --> 04:27.876
No cameras.

04:28.006 --> 04:30.400
Client is very
adamant about that.

04:30.531 --> 04:32.446
Matter of fact, let me check
underneath the truck.

04:34.361 --> 04:36.276
[indistinct chatter]

04:39.104 --> 04:41.455
[Grace]
'Quickly, please.'

04:41.585 --> 04:42.978
Watch your step, baby.

04:44.719 --> 04:46.851
Prince, take your
brother's hand please.

04:48.244 --> 04:50.246
- Hm?
- Where's daddy?

04:59.734 --> 05:01.562
Thank you very..

05:03.433 --> 05:04.739
[indistinct chatter]

05:07.959 --> 05:09.439
So who was that guy, anyway?

05:09.570 --> 05:11.615
You kiddin', right?

05:11.746 --> 05:13.269
You didn't see him?

05:13.400 --> 05:15.053
I saw a skinny dude
with a scarf.

05:15.184 --> 05:16.664
[chuckles]

05:16.794 --> 05:18.927
Man, that was Michael Jackson.

05:19.057 --> 05:20.320
- What?
- Yeah.

05:20.450 --> 05:22.452
I guess he got tired of Bahrain.

05:22.583 --> 05:24.454
The most popular dude
on the planet is back

05:24.585 --> 05:26.543
in the country and we
the only ones that know it?

05:26.674 --> 05:27.936
Mum's the word.

05:29.764 --> 05:32.897
I'm John Feldman, Mr. Jackson's
personal assistant.

05:33.028 --> 05:34.682
Mr. Jackson would
like to say hello.

05:34.812 --> 05:37.032
Oh, really? I'm about
to meet Michael Jackson?

05:37.162 --> 05:38.686
Told you this was a good gig.

05:38.816 --> 05:40.644
- You good, bro?
- Yeah.

05:40.775 --> 05:43.255
[instrumental music]

06:00.098 --> 06:01.839
Hello, Bill.

06:01.970 --> 06:03.537
It's nice to meet you.

06:03.667 --> 06:05.190
It's a honor to meet you, sir.

06:05.321 --> 06:06.757
I'm a huge fan.

06:06.888 --> 06:10.674
[chuckles]
Thank you.

06:10.805 --> 06:13.460
I saw on your resume that
you've done work for Motown.

06:14.635 --> 06:16.114
Many times, sir.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.249
So I can trust you?

06:21.772 --> 06:23.383
Yes, sir.

06:23.513 --> 06:24.862
- Of course.
- 'Daddy, daddy.'

06:24.993 --> 06:27.256
- 'Dad.'
- 'Daddy, daddy.'

06:27.387 --> 06:28.562
Volley-ball court.

06:28.692 --> 06:30.390
Not volley-ball, tennis.

06:30.520 --> 06:31.739
- Come on.
- Come on, we gotta--

06:31.869 --> 06:33.654
- Hey, hey, hey..
- Dad, dad..

06:33.784 --> 06:35.177
- Hey, come on.
- Come on, you gotta--

06:35.307 --> 06:36.961
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Dad, come on.

06:37.092 --> 06:40.400
Blanket, Blanket, Blanket!
Come, come back.

06:40.530 --> 06:42.793
Come back, everybody.

06:42.924 --> 06:44.795
Everybody.

06:44.926 --> 06:46.406
Say hello to Bill.

06:46.536 --> 06:48.625
[in unison]
Hi, Bill.

06:48.756 --> 06:50.627
Hi.

06:50.758 --> 06:53.021
Bill's our new head of security.

06:55.937 --> 06:57.852
You will stay in
the night, right?

06:59.070 --> 07:00.985
- Um, uh..
- Right.

07:01.116 --> 07:02.204
[chuckles]

07:02.334 --> 07:04.554
Yes, sir. Of course.

07:04.685 --> 07:07.818
- Okay, come on.
- Please, please, please, dad..

07:07.949 --> 07:10.081
- Let's go and see the pool.
- Yes!

07:10.212 --> 07:12.997
And then, and then we'll see
the bedroom. And then..

07:13.128 --> 07:16.392
So where's his staff,
his manager?

07:16.523 --> 07:18.481
He's traveling only
with me and the nanny.

07:18.612 --> 07:20.440
So it would just be me?

07:21.658 --> 07:23.834
You told him yes.

07:30.014 --> 07:31.146
[cocks gun]

07:54.169 --> 07:55.518
[exhales]

07:55.649 --> 07:58.478
[music continues]

08:25.940 --> 08:27.724
[breathing heavily]

08:35.078 --> 08:36.820
[murmuring]

08:44.436 --> 08:46.874
Excuse me, Mr. Bill.

08:47.004 --> 08:48.484
- Oh!
- Hi.

08:49.093 --> 08:50.530
Hey.

08:53.750 --> 08:55.447
I'm Paris,
it's nice to meet you

08:55.578 --> 08:56.797
Well..

08:56.927 --> 08:58.712
It's nice to meet you too.

09:00.365 --> 09:01.715
Daddy said
to bring you this

09:01.845 --> 09:03.847
and introduce myself.

09:03.978 --> 09:05.632
Okay.

09:05.762 --> 09:07.634
- Well, thank you.
- 'You're welcome.'

09:07.764 --> 09:09.287
I put the marshmallows in
myself.

09:09.418 --> 09:11.942
'Marshmallows. Very nice.'

09:12.073 --> 09:14.162
- Bye.
- Bye.

09:14.292 --> 09:16.120
Oh, yeah, be careful,
it's really hot.

09:16.251 --> 09:18.166
- 'Okay.'
- Bye.

09:19.863 --> 09:21.822
Oh, boy.

09:22.736 --> 09:23.954
[slurps]

09:24.085 --> 09:25.303
Oh, yeah.

09:25.434 --> 09:26.957
[Bill]
I was conflicted.

09:27.088 --> 09:29.743
On the one hand,
I had my family.

09:29.873 --> 09:32.572
But on the other, here was
this man and his family

09:32.702 --> 09:34.661
in this odd situation

09:34.791 --> 09:36.445
with no one
lookin' out for them.

09:36.576 --> 09:37.838
What else could I do?

09:37.968 --> 09:39.796
I took the job.

09:42.451 --> 09:43.887
[John]
'You'll be paid twice a month'

09:44.018 --> 09:44.932
on the 3rd and the 18th

09:45.062 --> 09:47.108
and if you have any questions

09:47.238 --> 09:48.979
do not bother Mr. Jackson.

09:49.110 --> 09:51.068
And do not ask the nanny.

09:51.199 --> 09:53.505
Ask me. And only me.

09:58.467 --> 09:59.860
Hi, Bill.

09:59.990 --> 10:01.383
Mr. Jackson would
like to do some

10:01.513 --> 10:03.603
Christmas shopping
at the mall, can you arrange it?

10:03.733 --> 10:05.561
[Bill]
Grace Rwaramba was the nanny.

10:05.692 --> 10:07.389
She was Mr. Jackson's
right hand.

10:07.519 --> 10:10.697
And his kids,
his kids adored her.

10:10.827 --> 10:12.612
Now that they were
back in the States

10:12.742 --> 10:15.615
the kids couldn't wait
to shop in familiar stores.

10:15.745 --> 10:18.356
So Mr. Jackson arranged
a trip to the mall.

10:18.487 --> 10:20.663
I hired extra private securit.

10:20.794 --> 10:24.058
We traveled underground like
rats scurrying through a maze.

10:24.188 --> 10:26.277
That's the world
Michael Jackson had to live in

10:26.408 --> 10:28.628
to get anywhere safely.

10:28.758 --> 10:31.326
[indistinct chatter]

10:35.069 --> 10:36.113
Okay.

10:36.244 --> 10:39.464
So, um, Paris is OshKosh.

10:39.595 --> 10:41.292
Blanket here is Kuko.

10:41.423 --> 10:44.774
Now, remember that,
because he's the rebel, he runs.

10:44.905 --> 10:47.690
No need to remember Prince's,
he's the oldest.

10:47.821 --> 10:49.823
He protects the others
and he never runs, right?

10:49.953 --> 10:52.956
- Right.
- Okay. OshKosh, Kuko?

10:53.087 --> 10:54.305
- Mm-hm.
- 'Copy that.'

10:54.436 --> 10:55.611
- Yeah.
- 'Are you ready, sir?'

10:55.742 --> 10:58.005
Wait, wait, wait.

10:58.135 --> 10:59.049
What game do we play?

10:59.180 --> 11:00.398
[in unison]
Shazam!

11:00.529 --> 11:03.053
- Alright, come on, let's do it.
- Ta-da!

11:03.184 --> 11:04.402
- Have a look.
- Me first. Me first.

11:04.533 --> 11:05.795
Blanket, Blanket, Blanket.

11:05.926 --> 11:07.928
- I want this one.
- Where's your manners?

11:08.058 --> 11:10.539
Sorry. Please.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.933
[sighs]
Okay, come on. Put it on.

11:14.108 --> 11:16.023
Now, listen, everybody.

11:16.153 --> 11:19.679
You gotta stay close to Grace
and close to each other, okay?

11:19.809 --> 11:21.289
Do not use your real name.

11:21.419 --> 11:22.769
'Always be polite.'

11:22.899 --> 11:24.814
And listen, hey.

11:24.945 --> 11:27.208
Jehovah's watching you.

11:27.338 --> 11:28.644
- Are you ready?
- Yes, I'm.

11:28.775 --> 11:29.689
You ready there?

11:29.819 --> 11:31.255
Mr. Jackson made the mass

11:31.386 --> 11:33.083
seem like part of a big game.

11:33.214 --> 11:34.868
But really, he was protecting

11:34.998 --> 11:36.260
his children from a world

11:36.391 --> 11:37.914
that was hungry to get at the.

11:39.176 --> 11:41.178
- Okay.
- Okay, ready?

11:41.309 --> 11:42.702
Are you excited?

11:42.832 --> 11:43.790
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

11:43.920 --> 11:45.313
[laughing]

11:45.443 --> 11:47.402
- I wanna get a Barbie doll.
- You do?

11:47.532 --> 11:48.925
'You wanna get a Barbie..'

11:49.056 --> 11:49.839
- 'Well, what do you want?'
- 'I need..'

11:49.970 --> 11:50.840
[Michael]
'Grace.'

11:50.971 --> 11:53.321
[indistinct chatter]

11:53.451 --> 11:55.192
[Grace]
Where do you want to go first?

11:55.323 --> 11:57.194
Toy, toy. Toys.

11:57.325 --> 11:59.022
[indistinct chatter]

11:59.153 --> 12:00.284
- Look over there!
- 'Oh, my gosh!'

12:00.415 --> 12:02.069
- 'Michael Jackson!'
- 'Michael!'

12:02.199 --> 12:03.331
Whoo!

12:03.461 --> 12:05.333
[clamoring]

12:07.814 --> 12:08.989
I love you!

12:10.381 --> 12:11.643
- I love you!
- 'Oh, my God!'

12:11.774 --> 12:14.908
- Michael! Michael!
- 'I love you.'

12:15.038 --> 12:16.300
We should've disguised you.

12:16.431 --> 12:18.085
- It doesn't work..
- Back off!

12:18.215 --> 12:20.130
We need to get out of here
before somebody gets hurt.

12:20.261 --> 12:23.568
- Easy, people!
- Stay easy, people!

12:23.699 --> 12:25.005
[Bill]
'Easy now.'

12:25.135 --> 12:26.528
- You're crushing me.
- Get away, hey!

12:26.658 --> 12:28.225
- Hey!
- Bill, don't hurt her.

12:28.356 --> 12:30.140
[indistinct yelling]

12:32.316 --> 12:34.884
My children, Bill!
I can't see my children!

12:35.015 --> 12:36.190
- I love you!
- 'I can't see my children!'

12:36.320 --> 12:37.887
Dad!

12:38.018 --> 12:39.062
- I see 'em!
- Bill!

12:39.193 --> 12:40.716
[clamoring]

12:40.847 --> 12:42.196
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Michael!

12:42.326 --> 12:44.067
[clamoring]

12:45.982 --> 12:47.592
Call in for more backup,
right now.

12:47.723 --> 12:50.247
We need more backup.
Get these kids out of here now!

12:50.378 --> 12:52.162
[indistinct chatter]

12:55.252 --> 12:56.558
Move, move! Let's go!

12:56.688 --> 12:59.039
[clamoring]

13:01.389 --> 13:03.260
[Blanket]
'I just wanna go home.'

13:03.391 --> 13:06.611
- Why are there so many people?
- It's okay.

13:06.742 --> 13:07.961
[Michael]
'It's gonna be okay.'

13:08.091 --> 13:09.397
Okay, come on.

13:11.007 --> 13:11.965
[Michael]
'Come, let's go with Bill.'

13:12.095 --> 13:13.705
'Come on, go with Bill.'

13:14.968 --> 13:16.708
[Grace]
'Thank you, Bill.'

13:16.839 --> 13:19.320
'Baby.
You were very brave, baby.'

13:19.450 --> 13:21.713
Take your time, cadet. Okay.

13:21.844 --> 13:24.020
[Grace]
'It's okay. It's okay.'

13:25.065 --> 13:26.588
'You're safe now.'

13:32.855 --> 13:34.030
[sighs]

13:37.686 --> 13:40.558
[Bill]
Mr. Jackson wanted to give
his kids a normal life.

13:40.689 --> 13:43.648
So, even though he personally
didn't celebrate Christmas

13:43.779 --> 13:45.607
he made sure
the day was special for them.

13:45.737 --> 13:47.827
[in unison]
Grandma!

13:47.957 --> 13:49.698
- I think she's coming.
- What?

13:49.829 --> 13:51.221
- Uh, well, I think..
- What?

13:51.352 --> 13:52.919
But I would really
want her to be here.

13:53.049 --> 13:54.137
- 'Look, she's nearly here.'
- She's here.

13:54.268 --> 13:56.357
- I see her! I see her!
- Grandma!

13:56.487 --> 13:58.272
[together]
Grandma!

13:58.402 --> 13:59.708
- Dad, she's here. She's here.
- She's here.

13:59.839 --> 14:01.623
- Wait, wait, wait. No, no, no!
- Hi, grandma.

14:01.753 --> 14:03.233
- Blanket, no, wait.
- Grandma!

14:03.364 --> 14:05.235
- Come on, dad, come on!
- Please, can we go?

14:05.366 --> 14:07.455
Be very careful,
be very careful.

14:07.585 --> 14:09.674
- Presents.
- Presents.

14:09.805 --> 14:10.937
[Paris]
'Grandma.'

14:11.067 --> 14:12.503
[in unison]
'Grandma!'

14:12.634 --> 14:14.288
Oh, I have missed you.

14:14.418 --> 14:16.507
- Hi, grandma!
- Oh, hi.

14:16.638 --> 14:18.205
Look at you, Blanket.

14:18.335 --> 14:21.730
Oh, Prince, what a nice
young man you are.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.123
- 'Thank you, grandma.'
- 'Lovely, Paris.'

14:23.253 --> 14:25.473
Now, take those presents
grandmother brought you.

14:25.603 --> 14:27.214
- 'And take them inside.'
- Thank you, grandma.

14:27.344 --> 14:28.650
- You're welcome.
- Mother.

14:28.780 --> 14:31.218
- Hi, darling.
- Oh, how are you?

14:31.348 --> 14:33.916
- I love you.
- I'm just fine, I love you too.

14:34.047 --> 14:35.918
- Thank you for being here.
- Well..

14:36.049 --> 14:38.573
Jehovah's blessed me
to spend this time with you.

14:38.703 --> 14:40.444
It's a pleasure, my darling.

14:40.575 --> 14:42.359
Oh, my goodness.

14:42.490 --> 14:43.926
Look at this,
this is wonderful.

14:44.057 --> 14:45.710
- You like it?
- Yes.

14:45.841 --> 14:47.974
You need to stop
running around the world.

14:48.104 --> 14:50.411
- I know.
- And settle down in one place.

14:50.541 --> 14:51.891
I promise I am, mother.

14:52.021 --> 14:53.457
- Alright. Yes.
- You know that?

14:53.588 --> 14:54.981
Exactly what I came here to do.

14:55.111 --> 14:56.721
- Look at this place.
- It's beautiful.

14:56.852 --> 14:57.635
- This is wonderful.
- Look at it.

14:57.766 --> 14:59.246
Yes, it is.

14:59.376 --> 15:00.943
Mom, thank you for being here.

15:01.074 --> 15:03.032
- I'm happy to be here.
- Means a lot to the kids.

15:03.163 --> 15:05.774
I love you, dar.. Yes.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.690
- 'Look at them.'
- 'Oh!'

15:08.820 --> 15:10.648
- What'd you get?
- What do you think of that?

15:10.779 --> 15:13.390
What is this?
What is this?

15:13.521 --> 15:15.131
Oh, I love it!

15:15.262 --> 15:18.308
- 'Oh!'
- 'Thank you so much, grandma!'

15:18.439 --> 15:20.180
- I love it!
- You're welcome, baby!

15:20.310 --> 15:21.964
- Oh, my goodness!
- Spiderman.

15:22.095 --> 15:23.574
- Oh!
- Like that Spiderman?

15:23.705 --> 15:25.968
You got socks,
I got a Spiderman.

15:26.099 --> 15:28.884
- Oh!
- I love it, grandma! I love..

15:29.015 --> 15:30.799
- Thanks, grandma.
- I know, baby.

15:32.192 --> 15:34.020
Hey, Prince.

15:34.150 --> 15:36.674
Prince?

15:36.805 --> 15:38.546
- 'It's for you.'
- 'What's in the box?'

15:39.329 --> 15:40.635
[gasps]

15:40.765 --> 15:44.465
- Oh!
- He's so cute!

15:44.595 --> 15:46.597
[indistinct chatter]

15:46.728 --> 15:48.164
- I got a doggie!
- Yes!

15:48.295 --> 15:49.992
- Thank you, daddy!
- That's okay.

15:50.123 --> 15:51.602
[Prince]
'He's beautiful!'

15:51.733 --> 15:53.561
Can I call him Kenya?

15:53.691 --> 15:55.693
He's yours. Come on.

15:55.824 --> 15:57.521
- Oh, Kenya.
- He's adorable.

15:57.652 --> 15:58.958
Hi, Kenya!

15:59.088 --> 16:00.481
- Hi, Kenya!
- Hey, hey, hey!

16:00.611 --> 16:02.700
Hey! Kenya's not a toy.

16:02.831 --> 16:06.182
He's a living thing.
Take care of him, okay?

16:06.313 --> 16:08.054
- I promise I will.
- Okay.

16:08.184 --> 16:09.533
- Thank you, daddy.
- 'That's okay.'

16:09.664 --> 16:12.319
- Hey.
- Aww! Can I hold it?

16:12.449 --> 16:14.495
You're too young.

16:14.625 --> 16:16.453
[chuckles]
They love..

16:16.584 --> 16:18.368
Do you see this?

16:18.499 --> 16:20.631
Bill, uh..

16:20.762 --> 16:24.853
'I need you to watch over my son
and my grandbabies.'

16:24.984 --> 16:27.160
- Hm?
- Yes, ma'am.

16:27.290 --> 16:29.814
You know, it's only a matter
of time before folks figure out

16:29.945 --> 16:31.773
'where they, where they live.'

16:33.514 --> 16:35.516
Yes.

16:35.646 --> 16:39.085
Thank you. Thank you, Jove.

16:39.215 --> 16:42.044
[Bill]
Mrs. Jackson was right.
The secret was out.

16:42.175 --> 16:43.393
I needed permanent help.

16:43.524 --> 16:46.222
For the record, state your name.

16:46.353 --> 16:49.312
[Javon]
Ahem, uh, Javon Beard.

16:49.443 --> 16:52.750
Uh, uh, Javon Beard.

16:52.881 --> 16:55.405
It says here,
your job with Mr. Jackson

16:55.536 --> 16:58.365
was your first
celebrity protection job.

16:58.495 --> 17:00.106
That's right.

17:00.236 --> 17:02.847
With no experience,
how did you land

17:02.978 --> 17:04.066
such a high profile gig?

17:06.982 --> 17:10.029
Javon possessed the one
qualification that mattered.

17:10.159 --> 17:12.596
Jeff Adams is my cousin.

17:12.727 --> 17:14.511
The guy that got youthe job?

17:14.642 --> 17:16.731
The protection business
is like all businesses.

17:16.861 --> 17:18.776
It's about relationships.

17:18.906 --> 17:21.605
I trusted Jeff,
so I trusted Javon.

17:36.751 --> 17:38.318
Wait, what am I
supposed to do?

17:38.448 --> 17:39.971
Curtesy.

17:40.102 --> 17:41.538
You're serious?

17:41.669 --> 17:43.323
- No.
- Man, cool, man.

17:43.453 --> 17:46.108
This is the King of Pop
we talkin' about.

17:46.239 --> 17:47.457
[exhales]
Alright.

17:49.024 --> 17:51.157
- When is he coming?
- He's coming.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.036
Hey, Javon.

18:04.300 --> 18:05.823
How are you?

18:08.565 --> 18:10.132
Uh, e-excuse me?

18:10.263 --> 18:12.352
Bill says I can trust you.

18:12.482 --> 18:14.658
Y-yes, sir, yeah,
y-you can trust me, sir.

18:14.789 --> 18:16.051
Yes, sir.

18:16.182 --> 18:17.661
Then, welcome.

18:18.401 --> 18:20.360
Cereal?

18:20.490 --> 18:22.623
Uh-h, n-no thank you, sir.

18:22.753 --> 18:25.016
It's okay. Nice suit.

18:32.459 --> 18:34.461
Wait, wait, s-so that's it?
Like, I-I'm in?

18:34.591 --> 18:36.071
- I guess so.
- Ho-ooh!

18:36.202 --> 18:38.769
- Hey, don't let me down.
- I got you, man.

18:38.900 --> 18:42.033
And, don't tell anybody
who you're working for.

18:42.164 --> 18:43.861
I mean wait, like, like,
nobody? I mean..

18:43.992 --> 18:46.342
It's on a need-to-know
basis only.

18:46.473 --> 18:48.779
Need-to-know. Alright, alright!

18:48.910 --> 18:52.087
And don't come back
here lookin' like no pimp.

18:56.657 --> 18:57.962
God! Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

18:58.093 --> 18:59.312
Alright, man!

19:01.662 --> 19:05.492
Raymone Bain was Mr. Jackson's
publicist during the trial.

19:05.622 --> 19:08.843
She parlayed that into
a better position, manager.

19:08.973 --> 19:12.673
Ms. Bain had power
and wasn't afraid to use it.

19:12.803 --> 19:14.631
Your money comes from me,
gentlemen.

19:15.937 --> 19:17.939
So let's get you paid.

19:21.812 --> 19:23.423
'If you have any questions'

19:23.553 --> 19:25.686
do not bother Mr. Jackson.

19:25.816 --> 19:27.688
'Forget about Feldman and Grace'

19:27.818 --> 19:29.429
'and ask me and onlyme.

19:29.559 --> 19:32.432
I live in D.C.,
but I'm here all the time.

19:32.562 --> 19:34.651
I'm available by phone 24/7.

19:36.523 --> 19:38.655
And why don't y'all
get the security trailer

19:38.786 --> 19:40.614
brought down here?

19:40.744 --> 19:42.093
It's heated.

19:45.575 --> 19:48.230
Thank you!

19:48.361 --> 19:51.451
Shh! Yeah, I'll take that!

19:51.581 --> 19:54.149
[Javon]
I was in charge of reading
Mr. Jackson's fan mail.

19:54.280 --> 19:55.977
Then passing
the letters on to him.

19:56.107 --> 19:57.631
- 'Javon.'
- Hm?

19:57.761 --> 19:58.980
Check this out..

19:59.110 --> 20:01.112
"Dear, Mr. Jackson

20:01.243 --> 20:03.898
"last year,
I was diagnosed with cancer.

20:04.028 --> 20:08.294
"The only thing that kept
my spirits up was your music.

20:08.424 --> 20:11.645
"I listen to "Beat It"
almost every day.

20:11.775 --> 20:13.386
"And I did.

20:13.516 --> 20:15.562
"I am now cancer-free.

20:15.692 --> 20:17.041
Thank you. Shirley."

20:17.172 --> 20:19.870
Wow. That's real nice.

20:21.176 --> 20:22.351
Hey, look at this fancy one.

20:22.482 --> 20:24.005
[laughs]

20:24.135 --> 20:28.227
It's all cute.
Let's see what we got here.

20:28.357 --> 20:30.664
[clears throat]
"Dear, Michael

20:30.794 --> 20:33.580
you are a filthy
child molester."

20:34.755 --> 20:37.236
Go ahead.

20:37.366 --> 20:40.108
"You think you're above the law,
you black son of a bitch.

20:40.239 --> 20:42.937
'"But as God as my witness,
I will hunt you down'

20:43.067 --> 20:45.331
'"tear you apart limb from limb'

20:45.461 --> 20:48.464
"then torture each one
of your three mongrel children

20:48.595 --> 20:50.074
"until they call me daddy

20:50.205 --> 20:52.294
and beg for
the sweet Lord's forgiveness."

20:55.166 --> 20:57.081
Goddamn!

20:57.212 --> 20:59.127
Let me get that, Javon.

21:00.607 --> 21:02.783
Executive Protection 101.

21:02.913 --> 21:04.306
All threats are real.

21:04.437 --> 21:06.308
And we check them all out.

21:06.439 --> 21:09.093
Mr. Jackson would always
remind us that

21:09.224 --> 21:12.923
John Lennon was killed
by one of his fans.

21:13.054 --> 21:14.751
Everything alright
out there, Bill?

21:14.882 --> 21:16.057
Everything is tight.

21:16.187 --> 21:17.885
Have a good night.

21:18.015 --> 21:19.321
Good night.

21:26.633 --> 21:27.764
[Grace]
Yes.

21:27.895 --> 21:29.375
Yes, miss, I understa..

21:29.505 --> 21:30.941
Can..

21:31.072 --> 21:32.508
Can you just take
this message, please?

21:32.639 --> 21:34.641
All I'm asking
is that you take..

21:34.771 --> 21:36.382
Hello?

21:42.257 --> 21:44.651
I can't believe this.

21:44.781 --> 21:46.566
Something wrong?

21:46.696 --> 21:49.090
Paris' birthday
is in two weeks and Mr. Jackson

21:49.220 --> 21:50.918
asked me to invite
some of his friends.

21:52.702 --> 21:54.225
Back in the day,
he had a lot of them.

21:54.356 --> 21:56.140
No doubt.

21:56.271 --> 22:00.797
I keep leaving messages,
but no one's calling back.

22:00.928 --> 22:03.452
No, it..

22:03.583 --> 22:07.238
I think he just
...he forgets sometimes that

22:07.369 --> 22:08.718
people don't want
to have anything

22:08.849 --> 22:10.503
to do with all that trial mess.

22:10.633 --> 22:12.374
But he was found innocent.

22:17.510 --> 22:19.599
What's that got
to do with anything?

22:23.646 --> 22:26.127
[party horn whistling]

22:26.257 --> 22:28.782
[Bill]
We did it up anyway.

22:28.912 --> 22:30.871
There are few things
Mr. Jackson loved

22:31.001 --> 22:32.089
more than a birthday.

22:32.220 --> 22:34.178
Make a wish.

22:37.399 --> 22:39.880
[cheering]

22:40.010 --> 22:42.012
Hey!

22:42.143 --> 22:43.971
- You know what I wished for?
- You're not supposed to tell.

22:44.101 --> 22:46.408
I wished we could go
back home to Neverland.

22:46.539 --> 22:48.236
I said don't tell!

22:48.367 --> 22:49.542
Now it's never
going to happen.

22:49.672 --> 22:52.196
Yes, it is!
We're going back.

22:52.327 --> 22:54.634
No. We're not.

22:54.764 --> 22:57.288
- Right, daddy?
- Blanket, look another balloon.

22:57.419 --> 22:58.899
We can't ever
go back to Neverland.

22:59.029 --> 23:00.857
But, but why not?

23:00.988 --> 23:02.729
Because that place

23:02.859 --> 23:05.384
has been contaminated by evil.

23:05.514 --> 23:08.038
See? Told you.

23:08.169 --> 23:10.345
[Paris]
Whatever.

23:10.476 --> 23:13.827
But at least, back
in Neverland I had friends.

23:13.957 --> 23:15.437
'And lots of people
came to my party.'

23:15.568 --> 23:18.222
And they had fun.
And so did I.

23:18.353 --> 23:21.008
- And they wanted--
- I'm gonna find us a home.

23:21.138 --> 23:23.053
I promise you I am.

23:25.012 --> 23:26.317
Don't do that.

23:27.188 --> 23:28.407
- Paris.
- Oh!

23:29.190 --> 23:30.583
Paris!

23:33.281 --> 23:34.674
[sighs]

23:44.553 --> 23:48.862
We would like to know about
Mr. Jackson's relationships.

23:48.992 --> 23:50.777
Who did he see
on a regular basis?

23:52.387 --> 23:53.910
[Bill]
Almost no one.

23:54.041 --> 23:55.651
Well, surely he had lots
of people in his life.

23:55.782 --> 23:58.001
- He was Michael Jackson.
- Yes!

23:58.132 --> 23:59.742
There was plenty
of people coming through

23:59.873 --> 24:04.181
but there was no one
who was really in his life.

24:04.312 --> 24:06.880
He had his children,
his mother.

24:08.185 --> 24:10.579
And his fans.

24:10.710 --> 24:12.712
His fans always
found out where he lived.

24:12.842 --> 24:15.323
This is an illegal assembly
and you all have to go.

24:15.454 --> 24:17.151
We have every right to be here.

24:17.281 --> 24:20.110
[indistinct chattering]

24:24.332 --> 24:27.291
[cheering]

24:38.259 --> 24:39.695
[Michael on phone]
'They're harassing my fans.'

24:39.826 --> 24:41.784
'Tell them it's okay
for them to be here!'

24:41.915 --> 24:44.657
[sighs]
Really, sir?

24:44.787 --> 24:46.659
[indistinct cheering]

24:48.312 --> 24:49.313
You are all breaking the law!

24:49.444 --> 24:52.099
[Bill]
Thank you. Get away.

24:52.229 --> 24:54.493
- Thank you, thank you.
- 'Listen to me right now.'

24:54.623 --> 24:56.059
- No, no, no, you do not, ma'am.
- You can't do this.

24:56.190 --> 24:57.713
You're breaking the law
right now.

24:57.844 --> 25:00.150
- You all have to le--
- Sir?

25:00.281 --> 25:02.109
It's okay
for these people to be here.

25:02.239 --> 25:05.852
- We own that property.
- You're the resident?

25:05.982 --> 25:08.028
I'm doin' private security
for the owner of the house.

25:08.158 --> 25:09.986
- Oh, yeah?
- Yes.

25:10.117 --> 25:11.031
And the owner of the house
doesn't have a problem

25:11.161 --> 25:12.293
with these people being here.

25:12.423 --> 25:14.382
[cheering]

25:15.949 --> 25:17.733
Is that right?

25:17.864 --> 25:20.431
I don't give a rat's fat ass
who lives here.

25:20.562 --> 25:22.651
Ladies and gentlemen,
you all have to stay

25:22.782 --> 25:24.784
on that side of the street,
or I'm coming back

25:24.914 --> 25:26.655
and arresting you all
for trespassing.

25:26.786 --> 25:28.091
Am I clear?

25:31.878 --> 25:32.922
Okay, everybody,
let's take it back

25:33.053 --> 25:34.445
on the other side of the street.

25:34.576 --> 25:37.492
[cheering]

25:42.802 --> 25:45.848
Okay, so he had his children,
his mother, his fans.

25:45.979 --> 25:47.284
[Javon]
And us.

25:47.415 --> 25:49.112
What about the rest
of the family?

25:50.679 --> 25:52.463
Tell us what you know,
please.

25:54.465 --> 25:57.556
It was spring of 2007.

25:57.686 --> 25:59.340
We looked at
the security gate camera

25:59.470 --> 26:01.734
and...there he was.

26:01.864 --> 26:04.388
[upbeat music]

26:10.960 --> 26:14.137
I think.. Joe Jackson!
Joe Jackson! Joe Jackson!

26:14.268 --> 26:17.184
[cheering]

26:19.621 --> 26:21.449
[sighs]

26:21.580 --> 26:22.624
You want me to go get him?

26:24.495 --> 26:25.714
I got it.

26:25.845 --> 26:28.674
[music continues]

26:40.424 --> 26:41.643
May I help you?

26:43.079 --> 26:44.603
Yeah.

26:44.733 --> 26:46.387
I'm here to see my son.
I-I'm coming in.

26:46.517 --> 26:49.085
I'm sorry, sir.
I can't let you do that.

26:49.216 --> 26:50.957
Can I give Mr. Jackson
a message?

26:55.265 --> 26:57.311
Yeah.

26:57.441 --> 26:58.878
Tell him his father's here.

27:00.140 --> 27:01.620
Yes, sir.

27:09.062 --> 27:09.889
[instrumental music]

27:10.019 --> 27:11.673
Mr. Jackson.

27:11.804 --> 27:13.327
Your father
would like to see you.

27:14.458 --> 27:16.417
Has he got an appointment?

27:17.374 --> 27:18.637
No, sir.

27:28.995 --> 27:31.127
Tell Joseph
to make an appointment.

27:31.258 --> 27:33.303
'I'm working.'

27:35.436 --> 27:37.394
Go on. Tell him.

27:38.526 --> 27:39.614
Yes, sir.

27:50.756 --> 27:52.627
I'm sorry, sir.

27:54.585 --> 27:57.197
You tell him,
I said to let me in.

28:00.374 --> 28:02.202
Call me and set up a time.

28:05.553 --> 28:07.686
I don't need
your damn number, boy!

28:07.816 --> 28:10.123
Look, I'm the one
who started this shit.

28:12.299 --> 28:16.129
Bastards like you wouldn't even
have a job if it wasn't for me.

28:16.259 --> 28:19.175
Hey! Hey, don't you
walk away from me!

28:19.306 --> 28:20.611
Look, I swear to God

28:20.742 --> 28:23.092
don't you come
between me and my son!

28:23.223 --> 28:25.660
'Fools like you
come and go every day.'

28:25.791 --> 28:27.923
I'm his father!
I'm always gonna be here!

28:28.054 --> 28:30.273
'Do you hear me?
Do you hear me?'

28:30.404 --> 28:32.667
Don't mess with my family!

28:39.326 --> 28:41.415
[indistinct chatter]

28:51.860 --> 28:53.383
Get out!

29:02.871 --> 29:05.178
[in unison]
Joe! Joe! Joe!

29:12.794 --> 29:16.929
Damn! That's one
scary-ass old dude!

29:17.059 --> 29:19.758
Or maybe he's just a father
tryin' to protect his son.

29:21.672 --> 29:24.501
[instrumental music]

29:34.555 --> 29:36.296
[Bill]
And then there was
that incident

29:36.426 --> 29:38.602
on the night
of Elizabeth Taylor's birthday.

29:38.733 --> 29:41.605
[upbeat music]

29:51.485 --> 29:53.008
[laughs]

29:57.708 --> 29:59.362
You guys have
Liz's gift, right?

29:59.493 --> 30:01.451
- Yes!
- It's wrapped the way I said?

30:01.582 --> 30:03.410
Everything is just the way
you wanted it, boss.

30:03.540 --> 30:05.760
Everything has to be
absolutely perfect.

30:05.891 --> 30:07.457
Yeah, we good.

30:07.588 --> 30:09.633
[laughs]

30:09.764 --> 30:12.985
- Ooh!
- King of Pop!

30:13.115 --> 30:14.769
[Javon]
'Yo, straight up!'

30:14.900 --> 30:16.858
Come on!
What are you watching me for?

30:16.989 --> 30:19.078
Get ready.
Come on, hurry up!

30:19.208 --> 30:20.514
- 'Go!'
- Okay. Okay, let's go.

30:21.863 --> 30:24.735
[music continues]

30:31.481 --> 30:32.874
Hey, how do we look?

30:33.005 --> 30:34.484
Like you're going
to the prom.

30:34.615 --> 30:35.703
[scoffs]

30:35.834 --> 30:37.313
I mean it. You guys look great.

30:37.444 --> 30:38.314
[tires screeching]

30:38.445 --> 30:40.186
[vehicle crashes]

30:40.316 --> 30:41.796
Damn!

30:43.189 --> 30:44.451
[gate rattling]

30:53.895 --> 30:56.550
- What's happening?
- 'Cover Mr. Jackson!'

30:56.680 --> 30:57.856
[Javon]
'Mr. Jackson, no!'

30:57.986 --> 30:59.509
Get down, sir! Get down!

31:00.859 --> 31:02.121
Sir, stay back.

31:02.251 --> 31:03.557
[car crashes]

31:06.603 --> 31:08.605
- Sir, please! Stay back!
- Damn!

31:12.131 --> 31:13.393
[tires screeching]

31:13.523 --> 31:15.482
Stop the car or I'll shoot!

31:15.612 --> 31:18.050
You got about one second
to start talking!

31:18.180 --> 31:20.443
Hey, shut up!

31:20.574 --> 31:22.489
Hey, get the gun
out of my face, alright?

31:22.619 --> 31:24.099
It's Randy!

31:24.230 --> 31:26.362
- 'I want to see my brother!'
- Hell no!

31:26.493 --> 31:28.843
- Not like this, you not!
- Hey, he owes me money!

31:28.974 --> 31:31.715
Move this car
back outside the gate.

31:31.846 --> 31:33.979
And then I'll tell
Mr. Jackson you here.

31:34.109 --> 31:36.633
Negro, please!

31:36.764 --> 31:38.722
I ain't movin'
until I get my money!

31:38.853 --> 31:42.248
So go on, get him! I got
all day! Got nowhere to be.

31:42.378 --> 31:44.685
'Now tell him to pay me,
or I'm goin' to the press.'

31:44.815 --> 31:47.557
CNN, NBC.
Go get my money!

31:47.688 --> 31:50.734
No! No more press! None!

31:50.865 --> 31:53.128
Copy. Okay, sir, uh..

31:53.259 --> 31:56.131
I'm gonna block the..
Sir, sir! Please!

31:56.262 --> 31:58.220
I will block Randy
with one of the trucks

31:58.351 --> 32:00.179
Bill can bring you out
through the side entrance, okay?

32:00.309 --> 32:02.442
- Let's go.
- Listen, you don't know Randy!

32:02.572 --> 32:05.358
You don't knowhim!

32:05.488 --> 32:07.316
He will follow us
to Liz's party

32:07.447 --> 32:09.318
and cause a huge scene!

32:09.449 --> 32:11.364
And she does not deserve that.

32:12.800 --> 32:14.715
What do you want us to do, sir?

32:14.845 --> 32:16.151
[breathing heavily]

32:20.895 --> 32:23.028
There's only one person
that can deal with him.

32:25.508 --> 32:27.858
[car approaches]

32:45.267 --> 32:47.704
Did you threaten

32:47.835 --> 32:50.011
to call
the press on your brother?

32:50.142 --> 32:52.144
[Bill]
I don't know exactly
what Mr. Jackson

32:52.274 --> 32:53.972
said to Randy that night.

32:54.102 --> 32:56.583
All I knew is,
he took care of the incident.

32:56.713 --> 32:58.150
Apparently, he didn't need
an appointment

32:58.280 --> 33:00.413
to fix a tough situation.

33:00.543 --> 33:03.372
Clearly, he was still
in charge of the family.

33:03.503 --> 33:04.983
And this is no way
to get somebody

33:05.113 --> 33:06.288
to do somethin' for you.

33:06.419 --> 33:09.030
Now, you stop actin'
like a damn fool

33:09.161 --> 33:11.728
and take your triflin' ass home.

33:11.859 --> 33:14.296
- But you don't understand--
- Do it!

33:25.568 --> 33:26.787
[engine starts]

33:29.616 --> 33:31.139
[Michael]
'This should never
have happened.'

33:31.270 --> 33:33.315
He can't just come up
to my house like this!

33:33.446 --> 33:35.709
'This can never happen again,
do you understand?'

33:35.839 --> 33:37.885
- Do you understand?
- 'We're sorry, sir.'

33:38.016 --> 33:39.974
[Javon]
'We're sorry, sir.'

33:40.105 --> 33:42.629
We can still make
that party if we hurry.

33:42.759 --> 33:44.848
- 'Yeah.'
- It's ruined!

33:46.937 --> 33:48.722
I can't, I can't bring
this to Liz's party.

33:48.852 --> 33:50.419
[Javon]
'Well, sir, l-look

33:50.550 --> 33:52.334
the perimeter's
totally secure now

33:52.465 --> 33:53.683
or we can take you out
through the garage

33:53.814 --> 33:55.163
just-just like always.

33:55.294 --> 33:59.037
He'll be out there, waiting.
He'll follow me.

33:59.167 --> 34:01.213
'I can't bring this to her.'

34:01.343 --> 34:03.345
I won't do it to her.

34:04.607 --> 34:05.739
[Javon]
Sir.

34:05.869 --> 34:08.306
- So?
- I'm going to bed.

34:13.572 --> 34:15.487
Are you sure, sir?

34:16.793 --> 34:18.273
Good night.

34:20.058 --> 34:21.710
[Bill]
As it turned out

34:21.842 --> 34:25.976
he and Ms. Taylor never
saw each other again.

34:26.107 --> 34:28.456
- I said, that's all.
- Yes, sir.

34:32.592 --> 34:34.376
[Grace]
'Hey, Paris, no running,
no running!'

34:34.507 --> 34:36.204
[Bill]
Mr. Jackson insisted
that there be

34:36.335 --> 34:38.902
structure and routine
in their education.

34:39.033 --> 34:42.471
School started every day
at 8 a.m. sharp.

34:42.601 --> 34:44.342
[in unison]
Me! Me!

34:44.473 --> 34:46.431
Alright, alright,
alright, calm down!

34:46.562 --> 34:48.042
Calm down, let us,
calm down! Hey!

34:48.172 --> 34:50.436
Hey, hey, hey!
Listen, sit down. Sit down.

34:50.565 --> 34:52.873
Alright, it's map study time.

34:53.003 --> 34:56.311
Blanket, please finish coloring
the Western States blue.

34:56.442 --> 34:57.878
- Okay.
- Prince? Paris?

34:58.008 --> 34:59.097
[Bill]
As strict as Mr. Jackson

34:59.227 --> 35:01.142
was about homeschooling

35:01.273 --> 35:05.277
sometimes we just needed to get
the kids out of the house.

35:05.407 --> 35:08.062
- 'Can we stop, please, daddy?
- 'Daddy, can we stop?'

35:14.982 --> 35:16.026
[together]
Oh!

35:17.506 --> 35:18.899
- 'Look at that.'
- 'I want to..'

35:19.029 --> 35:21.554
[Paris]
'Wow! Wow! Look at that.'

35:21.684 --> 35:24.122
[Prince]
'Dad!'

35:24.252 --> 35:25.949
I wanna do that.

35:26.080 --> 35:27.603
Whoa!

35:27.734 --> 35:29.953
'Dad! It's so cool.'

35:30.084 --> 35:31.085
- 'Ready?'
- Whoa!

35:31.216 --> 35:34.088
Whoa, I like it.

35:34.219 --> 35:35.916

49:38.671 --> 49:40.890
Look at it, Bill.

49:43.284 --> 49:44.677
Magic.

49:50.509 --> 49:52.990
Bill, this is wonderland!

49:55.601 --> 49:57.298
This is wonderland.

50:12.705 --> 50:14.620
- Hi, daddy!
- Hey, kids.

50:14.750 --> 50:16.491
- Come on down.
- Come on, Blanket, let's go.

50:16.622 --> 50:18.363
- Let's go, let's go.
- Come on!

50:18.493 --> 50:19.929
- Look at the waterfall.
- Whoa! Look at this tree.

50:20.060 --> 50:21.540
- You like it?
- Are you kidding me?

50:21.670 --> 50:22.802
This place is amazing.

[Michael]
'It has an indoor pool'

50:24.369 --> 50:26.675
and guest quarters
for the governess.

50:26.806 --> 50:27.720
The governors?

50:27.850 --> 50:30.027
No, Javon, the governess.

50:30.157 --> 50:31.724
The one who watches
over the kids.

50:31.854 --> 50:33.595
Oh, y-you mean like a nanny.

50:33.726 --> 50:35.032
I love it, I love it,
I love it!

50:35.162 --> 50:36.642
You need to read more.

50:36.772 --> 50:37.991
- Ha-ha-ha!
- Come on, Blanket, let's go.

50:38.122 --> 50:39.514
Look at 'em.

50:39.645 --> 50:42.474
Look at the waterfalls.
And there's a turtle.

50:42.604 --> 50:44.041
- You like it, huh?
- This place is amazing.

50:44.171 --> 50:45.738
Can we have animals?

50:45.868 --> 50:47.870
Of course, we can have animals.

50:48.001 --> 50:51.352
- And call it Neverland?
- No, no, not that.

50:51.483 --> 50:53.180
This place is filled with love

50:53.311 --> 50:56.749
and peace, music and magic.

50:56.879 --> 50:58.707
This place is called Wonderland.

50:58.838 --> 51:00.579
[all]
Wonderland.

51:00.709 --> 51:04.061
- I wanna see my room.
- Me too. Can we go inside?

51:04.191 --> 51:05.105
[in unison]
Please, daddy? Please?

51:05.236 --> 51:06.715
I really wanna see my room.

51:06.846 --> 51:08.674
The agent says
she'll be here in 30 minutes.

51:08.804 --> 51:10.415
- Please? Please?
- Please? Please?

51:10.545 --> 51:11.807
Uh, why don't you go
and have a look

51:11.938 --> 51:13.374
at the, uh, turtles
and stuff up there.

51:13.505 --> 51:16.464
- Turtles..
- Oh, I wanna see the turtles.

51:16.595 --> 51:18.031
Well, you guys
have something in the car

51:18.162 --> 51:19.641
that can open the door, right?

51:19.772 --> 51:23.080
Mr. Jackson, I'm not sure
that's a good idea.

51:23.210 --> 51:26.735
Come on, it's fine. The realtor
already knows, it's my house.

51:26.866 --> 51:29.999
I'm telling you. Come on.

51:30.130 --> 51:32.306
- 'Heh!'
- 'I see, I see the turtle.'

51:32.437 --> 51:35.266
I'm gonna go get the tools
out the car.

51:35.396 --> 51:37.659
You know he's gonna get us
in trouble one of these days.

51:37.790 --> 51:39.922
Hey, it's part of the job.

51:40.053 --> 51:43.796
[Prince]
'Dad. Dad, look.
Look at the turtle.'

51:43.926 --> 51:45.232
- 'Dad, come here.'
- Ah.

51:50.585 --> 51:52.805
Yeah, "I'm gonna take you
on a nice date, Simone."

51:52.935 --> 51:54.372
Our freakin' first night out

51:54.502 --> 51:56.591
and you brought me
to this chicken spot.

51:56.722 --> 51:59.594
You bring me
to a freakin' chicken spot.

51:59.725 --> 52:01.901
Now, baby, this is our spot.
That's the whole point.

52:02.031 --> 52:03.424
Alright? We haven't
been out in a while..

52:03.555 --> 52:04.773
I feel like
I haven't seen you in forever

52:04.904 --> 52:05.861
since we had the baby.

52:05.992 --> 52:07.472
I mean, we're here now, right?

52:07.602 --> 52:09.604
Are you really workin'?

52:09.735 --> 52:11.345
What you talkin' about?

52:11.476 --> 52:13.739
I mean, I just wanna know,
are you really working?

52:13.869 --> 52:16.568
I don't know anyone
who works as much as you do.

52:16.698 --> 52:19.571
- Are you seein' someone else?
- No. Really?

52:19.701 --> 52:22.574
Babe, I told you, my boss
is really high-profile.

52:22.704 --> 52:25.316
I don't wanna get fired, Simone.
I got a family to feed.

52:25.446 --> 52:26.491
Okay, who is it?

52:28.580 --> 52:30.712
Babe, I'm not seein' anyone--

52:30.843 --> 52:32.584
Who is she? Don't touch me.

52:32.714 --> 52:33.846
Who is she?

52:33.976 --> 52:35.543
Are you gonna do this right now?

52:35.674 --> 52:37.980
You're gonna do this right now?
Hm?

52:38.111 --> 52:39.504
We haven't been out in months.

52:39.634 --> 52:41.070
Can't we just have
a good time, huh?

52:41.201 --> 52:43.856
This is crazy.
Can you go get me some water?

52:45.074 --> 52:47.381
Go get me water.

52:47.512 --> 52:48.774
You want cold or room temp?

52:51.124 --> 52:53.518
Come on, you can't stay mad
at me. I'll get you some water.

52:53.648 --> 52:54.823
Let me get some sugar first.

52:54.954 --> 52:57.391
[groans]
Stop.

52:59.654 --> 53:00.699
[sighs]

53:07.227 --> 53:08.489
Hey, how you doin'?

53:10.099 --> 53:11.797
Do I know you, man?

53:11.927 --> 53:14.582
Hey, man, how'd you like to earn
an easy 50,000?

53:15.975 --> 53:17.846
What are you talkin' about?

53:17.977 --> 53:19.718
I know who you work for.

53:19.848 --> 53:21.720
I just want one photo, man.

53:21.850 --> 53:24.244
One photo, you give me
the exact whereabouts

53:24.375 --> 53:28.335
Michael Jackson and his kids,
at a specific time next week..

53:28.466 --> 53:30.032
Money's yours. 50 Gs.

53:30.163 --> 53:33.427
Get the hell outta here, okay?

53:33.558 --> 53:36.996
Hey, hey. In case
you change your mind.

53:38.998 --> 53:40.347
Yeah, alright.

53:43.176 --> 53:46.223
I ain't gonna tell you
one more time, bro. Step!

54:00.498 --> 54:02.282
Who was that?

54:02.413 --> 54:04.589
Uh, just some clown.
I don't know.

54:04.719 --> 54:06.765
You know white people.

54:06.895 --> 54:08.723
Excuse me.
You need to pay for that.

54:08.854 --> 54:10.551
Yeah, well, I was distracted

54:10.682 --> 54:12.074
I-I'll get you the money
for the water. Don't worry--

54:12.205 --> 54:13.902
No, you need to get
my dollar right now.

54:14.033 --> 54:15.600
Mm-hm, watch your mouth
when you're talkin' to him.

54:15.730 --> 54:16.992
I don't need to watch my mouth--

54:17.123 --> 54:17.950
'Yes, you do.
You're not gonna talk'

54:18.080 --> 54:18.951
'to my man like you're crazy.'

54:19.081 --> 54:20.692
Thank you.

54:20.822 --> 54:22.128
I'm not talking
to anybody like they're crazy.

54:22.259 --> 54:23.999
What you need to do
is pay for that water.

54:24.130 --> 54:25.914
- Look, heffa, lower your voice.
- 'Heffa?'

54:26.045 --> 54:28.003
Little girl, Imma come over
this counter, okay?

54:28.134 --> 54:30.789
Right? So you brought me
here to kick her butt.

54:30.919 --> 54:32.094
That's what's about to happen.

54:32.225 --> 54:33.748
Larry, come handle these people.

54:33.879 --> 54:36.316
Yeah, Larry, come handle us.
I'll be right here, bro.

54:36.447 --> 54:38.536
Larry's gonna get
his ass kicked too.

54:46.195 --> 54:49.373

54:58.382 --> 55:01.559
Well, it's Ms. Bain.
Maybe I should answer it.

55:01.689 --> 55:04.170
No, they're only gonna try
and get me to do things

55:04.301 --> 55:05.780
I don't wanna do.

55:05.911 --> 55:07.304
[ringing continues]

55:10.263 --> 55:13.092
- Sir?
- Hello, Raymone.

55:13.222 --> 55:15.268
Mr. Jackson, as you know

55:15.399 --> 55:17.749
you came back to Vegas
to do a residency.

55:17.879 --> 55:19.228
Listen, Raymone..

55:19.359 --> 55:21.579
'The hotel has agreed
to the money'

55:21.709 --> 55:24.190
and they've agreed
to build you a custom arena

55:24.321 --> 55:26.018
just like they did
for Celine Dion.

55:26.148 --> 55:28.281
I don't wanna think
about that right now.

55:28.412 --> 55:30.414
Well, you need to think
about this now.

55:30.544 --> 55:32.981
If you wanna buy
that $55 million house

55:33.112 --> 55:34.722
you better get back up
on stage.

55:34.853 --> 55:37.595
I told you, I can't do that.

55:37.725 --> 55:39.988
Okay, well, then I guess
you'll just have to sell

55:40.119 --> 55:42.077
your music catalogue.

55:42.208 --> 55:44.297
No! I don't wanna sell
my catalogue!

55:46.821 --> 55:48.562
I won't do it!

55:48.693 --> 55:49.737
Damn it!

55:51.478 --> 55:54.655
I'm sorry, Bill. I'm sorry.

55:54.786 --> 55:57.876
- I'll get you a new phone.
- It's alright, sir.

55:58.006 --> 55:59.704
'Is there anything I can do?'

56:01.706 --> 56:04.273
Play my song, Bill.

Do you like them
better than me?

She's coughin', she-she's

57:50.902 --> 57:52.251
'She has a fever.'

Okay, okay.
I'll take her to the ER.

I'm your family, not them.

'No. No, no, no.'

what I'll do

I'm sorry, baby.

Please, sweetheart, just
a little bit. You haven't had--

- No. No, no, no!
- Just a little bit.

- Paris, you got to eat.
- I don't want soup!

- Then what do you want?
- I want to go home.

Oh. Please come in.

58:48.481 --> 58:50.309
Good evening, Mr. Jackson.

58:50.439 --> 58:52.572
I'm Dr. Conrad Murray.

58:54.748 --> 58:58.143
Thank you, doctor.
Thank you for coming.

58:58.273 --> 59:00.406
- My pleasure, sir.
- Please.

59:06.412 --> 59:08.327
How often did Dr. Murray visit?

59:10.329 --> 59:12.418
Five or six times.

59:12.549 --> 59:16.074
Did you ever see Dr. Murray
give Mr. Jackson drugs?

59:16.204 --> 59:19.512
- Not that I recall.
- So, then what happened?

59:19.643 --> 59:23.734
I had to stay back to pack up
the house for Wonderland.

59:23.864 --> 59:26.867
And I went to Virginia
with the family for three weeks

59:26.998 --> 59:30.175
thinkin' we'd return
to move into Wonderland.

59:30.305 --> 59:32.220
At this point

59:32.351 --> 59:35.484
our paychecks were erratic.

Sometimes
they didn't come at all.

Mr. Jackson decided
to take the children

59:43.275 --> 59:45.320
on a summer vacation back eas.

59:45.451 --> 59:47.540
So I went to Virginia
with the family

59:47.671 --> 59:49.411
and Javon stayed in Vegas

59:49.542 --> 59:51.631
to pack up the house
for the move to Wonderland.

59:55.592 --> 59:58.290

- Let me get that.
- Okay.

01:29:57.870 --> 01:29:59.481
- Come on.
- Alright.

01:29:59.611 --> 01:30:01.657
Oh, my God, look at,
look at all this stuff.

01:30:01.787 --> 01:30:03.049
Yeah.

01:30:04.616 --> 01:30:06.618
Okay.

01:30:06.749 --> 01:30:08.751
Things are about
to change, Bill.

01:30:08.881 --> 01:30:10.709
I'm talking to AEG

01:30:10.840 --> 01:30:11.841
about London.

01:30:11.971 --> 01:30:14.409
Oh, God.

01:30:14.539 --> 01:30:16.454
I'll do ten days, max..

01:30:17.716 --> 01:30:19.805
...and then after that

01:30:19.936 --> 01:30:21.807
we don't have to worry
about money no more.

01:30:21.938 --> 01:30:23.461
Okay.

01:30:23.592 --> 01:30:25.158
[sighs]

01:30:25.289 --> 01:30:27.813

'are gonna start coming'

01:30:35.473 --> 01:30:36.518
and everybody's gonna
want something

01:30:36.648 --> 01:30:39.651
and nobody's gonna
trust anybody.

01:30:39.782 --> 01:30:41.392
Bill, I need you to look
for golf carts.

01:30:41.523 --> 01:30:42.524
Sir?

01:30:42.654 --> 01:30:43.525
We need golf carts

01:30:43.655 --> 01:30:44.874
to patrol Wonderland

01:30:45.004 --> 01:30:46.528
after we move in.

01:30:46.658 --> 01:30:47.790
[Bill]
Michael Amir used the new money

01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:49.835
from AEG to rent Mr. Jackson

01:30:49.966 --> 01:30:52.011
another temporary house.

01:30:52.142 --> 01:30:54.449
Amir also brought in
a small army

01:30:54.579 --> 01:30:56.842
of Fruit Of Islam
security guards

01:30:56.973 --> 01:30:59.018
who answered only to him.

01:30:59.149 --> 01:31:01.194
Javon and I were marginalized

01:31:01.325 --> 01:31:03.762

and damn near pushed out

- Hey!
- Hey, Bill.

01:31:08.811 --> 01:31:10.726
- How you doin'?
- We missed you.

01:31:10.856 --> 01:31:12.597
- I missed you too.
- Love you.

01:31:12.728 --> 01:31:15.034
- Bye, Bill.
- Alright. Bye-bye. Alright.

01:31:15.165 --> 01:31:16.645
- Bye, Bill.
- Yeah.

01:31:16.775 --> 01:31:18.255
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:31:21.737 --> 01:31:25.697
Mr. Jackson would like
for you to have the fan mail

01:31:25.828 --> 01:31:27.307
all legal correspondences,
everything

01:31:27.438 --> 01:31:28.395
send directly to me now.

01:31:28.526 --> 01:31:30.789
Not a problem.

01:31:30.920 --> 01:31:32.487
Should we set up
the trailer?

01:31:32.617 --> 01:31:34.053
We're not gonna be here long.

01:31:34.184 --> 01:31:36.578
Just use the garage.

01:31:36.708 --> 01:31:39.711
I'm gonna need you and Javon
to sign NDAs.

01:31:39.842 --> 01:31:42.497
- What?
- You're protecting Mr. Jackson.

01:31:42.627 --> 01:31:44.586
In the two years I've been
workin' for Mr. Jackson

01:31:44.716 --> 01:31:46.762
have there been
any information leaks?

01:31:46.892 --> 01:31:50.592
In those two years
Mr. Jackson wasn't workin'.

01:31:50.722 --> 01:31:51.984
It's a new day.

01:31:52.115 --> 01:31:53.682
What if I say no?

01:31:53.812 --> 01:31:55.684
Then you and Javon
don't get paid.

01:31:55.814 --> 01:31:57.599
Man, you know me.

01:31:57.729 --> 01:32:00.253
You've seen what we've done
for Mr. Jackson.

01:32:00.384 --> 01:32:02.038
How are you gonna look me
in the eye and tell me

01:32:02.168 --> 01:32:04.562
you're not gonna pay me
until we sign some bull crap

01:32:04.693 --> 01:32:06.259

I'll take it up with the boss.

01:32:24.103 --> 01:32:25.278

I've been tryin' to get in touch
with my son.

01:32:37.900 --> 01:32:39.815

Well, I'm worried about him
a-and my grandchildren.

01:32:47.039 --> 01:32:50.565
Ms. Jackson, please don't worry,
I'm gonna have him call you.

01:32:50.695 --> 01:32:53.219
Thank you, Bill.

01:32:53.350 --> 01:32:54.394
He trusts you.

01:32:57.006 --> 01:32:58.137
I trust you.

01:32:58.268 --> 01:32:59.661
Yes, Ms. Jackson.

01:33:03.969 --> 01:33:05.754
Mr. Jackson won't be
seeing you today.

But I'm not here tryin' to get
anything from Mr. Jackson

01:33:24.599 --> 01:33:26.339
I'm here because I'm concerned.

01:33:26.470 --> 01:33:28.777
Don't be.

01:33:28.907 --> 01:33:30.561

it was a prank call.

it was me?

he meant to them
