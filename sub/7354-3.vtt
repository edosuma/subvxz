00:01.801 --> 00:03.702
<i>Previously on</i> legends...
(grunting)

00:03.704 --> 00:05.971
Mccombs:
<i>There is no martin odum.</i>
<i>He's a legend.</i>

00:05.973 --> 00:08.207
Who am I?!
Rice: <i>You know, the lapd--</i>
<i>they found a couple</i>

00:08.209 --> 00:10.476
More witnesses. Why didn't
you tell me you were there?

00:10.478 --> 00:13.112
Martin:
<i>I didn't kill him.</i>
<i>Rice:</i> <i>Who did?</i>

00:13.114 --> 00:14.646
What do they want?
I used to be a chemist

00:14.648 --> 00:16.315
<i>For the russian military.</i>

00:16.317 --> 00:18.283
Richard hubbard was actively
involved in russia's

00:18.285 --> 00:19.852
Chemical weapons program.

00:19.854 --> 00:22.721
Maggie: <i>The burglary</i>
<i>happened last night.</i>

00:22.723 --> 00:24.957
<i>Those are the chemicals used</i>
<i>to produce vx gas.</i>

00:24.959 --> 00:26.158
Crystal:
<i>There's only two motives here.</i>

00:26.160 --> 00:27.226
<i>They're gonna make vx to sell.</i>

00:27.228 --> 00:28.460
They're gonna make vx to use.

00:28.462 --> 00:29.962
Oh. I won't do it!

00:29.964 --> 00:33.198
But I think you will, alexander.
Colonel.

00:33.200 --> 00:36.001
Are you going under again?
This is gonna kill you.
Sonya...

00:36.003 --> 00:38.737
Who's the legend?
Gates:
<i>Dante auerbach, lord of war.</i>

00:42.008 --> 00:44.643
(panting)

01:10.203 --> 01:12.404
(groaning)

01:14.007 --> 01:15.774
Help me! Help me!

01:15.776 --> 01:17.576
I got you. Come on.

01:22.882 --> 01:24.616
(gasps)

01:39.232 --> 01:40.699
(loud thudding)
jane? Susan?

01:40.701 --> 01:42.101
It's me.

01:43.803 --> 01:46.305
Dad!
Come on. Come on.

01:46.307 --> 01:49.741
Come on, we have to go. Now.
Grab my hand. Let's go.

01:49.743 --> 01:50.976
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:50.978 --> 01:52.644
(whimpering)
I'm right behind you.

01:52.646 --> 01:53.645
Get over the fence.

01:53.647 --> 01:55.948
Come on, jane,
help me do this...

01:55.950 --> 01:58.383
Go, go, go. Go.
Help me.

02:00.920 --> 02:03.088
(speaking russian)

02:03.090 --> 02:04.389
(speaking russian)

02:04.391 --> 02:06.959
(women whimpering)

02:06.961 --> 02:08.727
Get on your knees.

02:24.911 --> 02:27.079
(screams)
no, no, ,no!

02:27.081 --> 02:28.614
Susan, susan,
are you okay?

02:28.616 --> 02:29.781
Are you okay?

02:29.783 --> 02:33.485
If you run again,
your family dies.

02:35.288 --> 02:36.421
(screams)

02:58.444 --> 03:00.212
Yes, martin odum
is our best asset,

03:00.214 --> 03:01.713
No question, when he's healthy.

03:01.715 --> 03:03.515
I read
the psych report, too.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.317
I'm concerned about
putting him under again

03:05.319 --> 03:09.321
So quickly at
such high stakes.

03:09.323 --> 03:11.023
We have no choice.

03:11.025 --> 03:13.625
Clock is ticking, people.

03:13.627 --> 03:15.494
They're not gonna hold hubbard
and his family

03:15.496 --> 03:17.029
Any longer than they have to.

03:17.031 --> 03:19.131
At a maximum, figure
three days to make the vx.

03:19.133 --> 03:21.833
Which means three days
until there's a weapons-grade

03:21.835 --> 03:24.036
Nerve agent on american soil.

03:24.038 --> 03:25.571
The amount
of chemicals stolen

03:25.573 --> 03:27.005
From that warehouse can be used

03:27.007 --> 03:29.241
To manufacture enough vx
to kill thousands.

03:29.243 --> 03:30.709
So, how is martin gonna be able

03:30.711 --> 03:32.544
To find the vx in time,
let alone the hubbards?

03:32.546 --> 03:35.314
His legend-- dante auerbach.

03:35.316 --> 03:37.149
He's got more contacts

03:37.151 --> 03:38.750
In the weapons black market
than anybody.

03:38.752 --> 03:40.252
What do we know about this guy
he's meeting?

03:40.254 --> 03:44.022
He goes by khalid.
Real name is ahmed abdul.

03:44.024 --> 03:46.592
He's a facilitator.
He makes introductions.

03:46.594 --> 03:48.994
Crystal: <i>So dante thinks khalid</i>
<i>will lead us to the vx</i>
<i>supplier.</i>

03:48.996 --> 03:50.896
<i>Hopefully, hubbard's captors.</i>

03:50.898 --> 03:52.397
All of that in three days.

03:52.399 --> 03:54.833
I'll just be curled up
in the corner over here.

03:54.835 --> 03:57.269
It's dante's show now.
Let's see what he does.

04:03.009 --> 04:04.376
Good day, sir.

04:04.378 --> 04:08.080
I find a scratch,
I'm taking a finger.

04:08.748 --> 04:12.117
Fair warning. Incentive.

04:26.065 --> 04:28.967
Bang. You're dead.

04:31.704 --> 04:34.039
Mr. Auerbach. Oh.
Khalid. How are you?

04:34.041 --> 04:35.407
That's one way
to say hello.

04:35.409 --> 04:37.409
Martin:
Long time.

04:37.411 --> 04:41.046
Then, they showed up with
the ammunition in boxes

04:41.048 --> 04:43.615
With chinese markings
after we'd warned them...

04:43.617 --> 04:46.318
I thought you were going to
shoot the bastards right there.
I was that close.

04:46.320 --> 04:47.653
That really happened?

04:47.655 --> 04:49.054
I highly doubt it.

04:49.056 --> 04:51.290
He's good.
Totally sold that.

04:51.292 --> 04:53.659
He doesn't win the academy award
until he gets a solid lead.

04:53.661 --> 04:55.761
I heard rumors you got pinched.

04:55.763 --> 04:58.263
I was running proxy contracts
for the pentagon,

04:58.265 --> 05:00.098
Arming the afghan
rebels through

05:00.100 --> 05:01.733
Some contacts in peshawar.

05:01.735 --> 05:02.934
Some material leaked?

05:02.936 --> 05:04.936
I was on the hook
for selling arms

05:04.938 --> 05:07.072
To groups hostile
to the United States.

05:07.074 --> 05:09.741
These people in washington--
such hypocrites.

05:09.743 --> 05:11.576
I do their bidding
until the d.O.D. Gets caught

05:11.578 --> 05:12.911
With their hands
in the cookie jar,

05:12.913 --> 05:14.146
Wants someone
to blame.

05:14.148 --> 05:15.614
Play with fire.

05:15.616 --> 05:18.116
Should have known.
So what now?

05:18.118 --> 05:20.118
You coming back?

05:20.120 --> 05:21.753
Martin:
What else am I gonna do?

05:21.755 --> 05:23.121
But no more gray market stuff.

05:23.123 --> 05:25.490
I got to do something--
I don't know--

05:25.492 --> 05:27.659
Do something bigger.

05:29.495 --> 05:31.096
You get pinched dealing wmd,

05:31.098 --> 05:33.598
And they'll throw away
the key, huh?

05:33.600 --> 05:35.834
I'm not gonna make
a career of it.

05:35.836 --> 05:38.970
Get in, get out,
walk away with eight figures.

05:38.972 --> 05:41.006
That's a risky game, my friend.

05:41.008 --> 05:43.141
I'm always looking
over my shoulder,

05:43.143 --> 05:45.677
No matter what kind of weight
I'm moving.

05:45.679 --> 05:48.947
Might as well
shoot for the moon.

05:48.949 --> 05:50.549
You have a buyer?
I've got a few
associates

05:50.551 --> 05:52.150
From the
shock-and-awe days.

05:52.152 --> 05:54.119
I've heard the chechens
have product available.

05:54.121 --> 05:56.021
But I don't have any connect.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.656
I was hoping
you might be able to help me.

05:57.658 --> 05:58.857
He's not gonna bite.

06:00.493 --> 06:01.993
There might be

06:01.995 --> 06:04.062
Someone in town.

06:04.064 --> 06:05.964
A greek.
Could be worth a shot.

06:05.966 --> 06:08.133
Searching all entry visas
for the last 30 days.

06:08.135 --> 06:11.403
Greek passports
and birthplaces.

06:11.405 --> 06:13.472
Cross-reference those names with
interpol's criminal database.

06:13.474 --> 06:15.040
Khalid:
But as a friend,

06:15.042 --> 06:18.243
I'd rather do time
than do business with paulanos.

06:18.245 --> 06:19.144
Paulanos.

06:19.146 --> 06:20.312
Tough negotiator.

06:20.314 --> 06:21.580
Maybe the toughest.

06:21.582 --> 06:23.482
Particularly for you.

06:23.484 --> 06:25.150
(laughs)
why me?

06:25.152 --> 06:27.185
I've known you
a long time, dante.

06:27.187 --> 06:29.988
You have certain weaknesses

06:29.990 --> 06:32.357
That paulanos may be
suited to exploit.

06:32.359 --> 06:34.760
Risk and reward go hand in hand.

06:34.762 --> 06:38.163
Can you set something up?

06:38.165 --> 06:39.698
Not getting any hits.

06:39.700 --> 06:42.334
Definitely an alias.

06:43.836 --> 06:45.704
(chuckles)

06:45.706 --> 06:48.039
Martin: <i>Reservation under</i>
<i>khalid, please.</i>

06:48.041 --> 06:50.342
The other party has arrived.
In the back.

06:50.344 --> 06:52.244
Thank you.

06:55.281 --> 06:57.416
Thank you.
You're welcome.

07:02.922 --> 07:06.024
Excuse me. I'm looking
for mr. Paulanos.

07:06.026 --> 07:08.093
I'm paulanos.

07:09.028 --> 07:12.197
Ana paulanos.

07:12.199 --> 07:15.267
What a lovely mistake.

07:19.305 --> 07:21.573
Where's khalid?

07:21.575 --> 07:23.375
Unfortunately,
something came up.

07:23.377 --> 07:26.244
He, uh... He sends his regrets.

07:26.246 --> 07:28.280
And who are you?
I'm a friend of his.

07:28.282 --> 07:30.482
A good friend.

07:30.484 --> 07:34.219
I'm afraid I'm too busy for
friends of friends, mister...

07:34.221 --> 07:37.222
Auerbach. Dante.
If you'll excuse me.

07:37.224 --> 07:39.624
Don't run off. You don't know
what you're missing.
Honestly, mr. Auerbach,

07:39.626 --> 07:42.227
I don't care.
It's no wonder
people don't take you seriously.

07:42.229 --> 07:44.095
Excuse me?

07:44.097 --> 07:45.230
Just because you're beautiful,

07:45.232 --> 07:46.898
You think every man wants
to sleep with you.

07:46.900 --> 07:49.067
I find it
very unprofessional.

07:49.069 --> 07:50.735
Did you think this was a date?

07:50.737 --> 07:53.638
Please. I have all I can handle
on that front.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.106
The guy is good.

07:55.108 --> 07:56.575
He's not that good.

07:56.577 --> 07:58.610
He's really good.
He's keeping ana around

07:58.612 --> 08:01.480
While I run the stingray that
he just planted under the table,

08:01.482 --> 08:03.815
Which allowed me to trick
every cell in the bar

08:03.817 --> 08:05.984
To broadcast to us
instead of the local tower.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.853
So, in another 15 seconds,

08:07.855 --> 08:09.588
I'll have isolated her cell,
then we have her calls,

08:09.590 --> 08:10.989
Contacts, texts, the works.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.525
<i>You're</i> good.
Martin:
Khalid thought

08:13.527 --> 08:15.760
We might like to meet
to do some business together.

08:15.762 --> 08:17.429
What line of work are you in?

08:17.431 --> 08:19.931
I'm in the wine business.

08:21.801 --> 08:25.704
Please... Sit.

08:29.141 --> 08:31.610
What are you in
the mood for?

08:31.612 --> 08:33.111
Red or white?

08:33.113 --> 08:35.380
I don't have a preference.
Good.

08:35.382 --> 08:37.182
I already ordered
an excellent chardonnay.

08:37.184 --> 08:40.385
What do you do
in the wine trade,

08:40.387 --> 08:41.853
Mr. Auerbach?

08:41.855 --> 08:44.556
I suppose you could call me
a private sommelier.

08:44.558 --> 08:46.658
I have a select
list of clients

08:46.660 --> 08:49.060
With very sophisticated palates.

08:49.062 --> 08:51.296
I buy wine for them.

08:51.298 --> 08:54.466
That's why I wanted
to meet you.

08:54.468 --> 08:55.901
I have one client in particular

08:55.903 --> 08:57.536
Who's interested
in rare vintages.

08:57.538 --> 08:59.304
(laughs)

08:59.306 --> 09:01.039
Go to napa.

09:01.041 --> 09:03.475
They don't want something
that can be bought in napa.

09:03.477 --> 09:05.977
They want something
no one else has.

09:05.979 --> 09:08.146
Something exceptional.

09:08.148 --> 09:10.148
These are people
of extreme means.

09:10.150 --> 09:12.083
Committed collectors.

09:17.023 --> 09:19.691
What size lot?

09:19.693 --> 09:22.327
Large lots. Exclusively.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.402
It's got a nice finish.

09:34.106 --> 09:36.341
Where are we?

09:36.343 --> 09:38.577
What is this place?

09:40.546 --> 09:43.915
(groans)

09:48.254 --> 09:50.355
(groans)

09:55.061 --> 09:57.395
You should be grateful.

09:57.397 --> 10:01.366
You have it much nicer
than I did in yavas.

10:01.368 --> 10:03.234
The corrective colony.

10:03.236 --> 10:05.203
Eight years I spent there

10:05.205 --> 10:08.073
In a cell a fraction
of the size of this room.

10:08.075 --> 10:10.275
Because of you.

10:10.277 --> 10:12.978
You betrayed me...
And our country.

10:12.980 --> 10:16.314
When you sold the weapons
to god only knows who.

10:16.316 --> 10:19.417
Don't act like you didn't know
things were going on, doctor.

10:19.419 --> 10:20.819
You took payments.

10:20.821 --> 10:22.621
Where did you think
the money was coming from?

10:22.623 --> 10:24.889
I came to believe
that what we were doing--

10:24.891 --> 10:26.558
What I was doing-- was wrong.

10:26.560 --> 10:32.263
I realized early in my life
that belief is subjective,

10:32.265 --> 10:35.634
Fallible, the road to folly.

10:36.268 --> 10:38.269
No.

10:38.271 --> 10:40.505
My belief...

10:42.408 --> 10:44.242
...Is not to believe.

10:44.244 --> 10:46.444
Instead,
one should act

10:46.446 --> 10:48.747
In one's best interest.

10:48.749 --> 10:50.749
Do you know
your own

10:50.751 --> 10:52.651
Best interests, alexander?

10:56.589 --> 10:57.922
Your family's?

10:57.924 --> 10:59.624
You're going
to make

10:59.626 --> 11:01.159
<i>The vx gas for me,</i>

11:01.161 --> 11:03.662
<i>Or you and your family</i>
<i>will die.</i>

11:06.866 --> 11:09.200
Martin: <i>Just left paulanos</i>
<i>at the restaurant.</i>

11:09.202 --> 11:11.436
<i>She knew I was talking</i>
<i>about black market weapons,</i>

11:11.438 --> 11:13.038
Was totally engaged.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.639
Maggie:
Incoming call on

11:14.641 --> 11:15.774
Paulanos' cell.

11:15.776 --> 11:17.308
We need a warrant, technically.

11:17.310 --> 11:18.710
Get gates up here.

11:18.712 --> 11:20.278
We have to run this down,
crystal.

11:20.280 --> 11:21.780
Don't have a lot of time.

11:21.782 --> 11:23.114
Backdate it.

11:23.116 --> 11:25.884
Fisa rubber-stamps
everything anyway.

11:25.886 --> 11:28.153
Paulanos:
Where is it, alain?

11:28.155 --> 11:31.022
Alain:
Be patient. Uh, the clients had
some unexpected complications.

11:31.024 --> 11:33.024
Maggie:
This guy's got
to be the buyer.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.826
That is their issue.
We had an agreement.

11:34.828 --> 11:36.361
The transfers

11:36.363 --> 11:39.330
Must be untraceable,
you understand that?

11:39.332 --> 11:40.632
You assured me
these were legitimate buyers.

11:40.634 --> 11:42.233
The money is coming.

11:42.235 --> 11:43.568
I promise.

11:43.570 --> 11:45.370
Paulanos: You have until
8:00 a.M. Tomorrow.

11:45.372 --> 11:47.372
Alain:
I'm moving on it.

11:49.041 --> 11:51.409
Paulanos is selling something.
Yeah, it's vx.

11:51.411 --> 11:52.811
Maggie:
We haven't confirmed that.

11:52.813 --> 11:54.145
But I've got her cell.

11:54.147 --> 11:55.680
I'm running down the contacts.

11:55.682 --> 11:57.248
I say we let it play out.

11:57.250 --> 11:59.317
What if we let it play out
and we lose ana?

11:59.319 --> 12:01.753
One vx canister
has enough nerve gas in it

12:01.755 --> 12:03.922
To kill everyone in this
building ten times over.

12:03.924 --> 12:06.391
Crystal's right. We got to keep
operational control, in case.

12:06.393 --> 12:08.993
Martin: Yeah, we need to get
this frenchman-- the broker--

12:08.995 --> 12:10.428
Get him out of the picture.

12:10.430 --> 12:12.530
Then I step into the deal
with a straw buyer.

12:12.532 --> 12:13.865
Maggie, any ping on the caller?

12:13.867 --> 12:15.100
Yes.

12:15.102 --> 12:16.901
I geolocated his cell.

12:16.903 --> 12:19.337
He is downtown
at the vondrian hotel.

12:19.339 --> 12:21.005
Let's get eyes on him.

12:21.007 --> 12:22.340
On my way.

12:38.190 --> 12:39.691
(knocking)

12:39.693 --> 12:41.926
Room service.

12:44.196 --> 12:45.530
One second.

12:45.532 --> 12:47.766
(unlocking)

12:48.200 --> 12:49.701
(grunting)

12:49.703 --> 12:51.436
(door locks)

12:53.072 --> 12:54.706
What are you doing?

12:56.041 --> 12:57.542
You will be killed for this.

12:57.544 --> 12:59.277
Yeah? Get up.

13:02.748 --> 13:04.883
"delicates."

13:04.885 --> 13:06.317
But no frenchman setting.

13:08.387 --> 13:09.788
(sizzling)

13:10.923 --> 13:12.323
This is not gonna stop

13:12.325 --> 13:13.792
Until you answer my questions.

13:13.794 --> 13:15.894
Lying won't help you. I'll know.

13:17.096 --> 13:18.463
What are you buying
from paulanos?

13:18.465 --> 13:20.231
They'll kill me.
Do you know there

13:20.233 --> 13:22.901
Are more nerve endings in the
lower back than in the genitals?

13:22.903 --> 13:24.769
Please. Please, don't.

13:24.771 --> 13:26.971
No. Please, no.

13:26.973 --> 13:29.240
Don't.

13:30.075 --> 13:31.943
Is it vx? Huh?

13:31.945 --> 13:34.078
No. No.

13:35.080 --> 13:37.415
(screams)

13:39.952 --> 13:41.519
Okay.

13:41.521 --> 13:44.756
Okay. Okay, it's vx.

13:44.758 --> 13:46.124
Who are you buying it for?

13:46.126 --> 13:47.492
I don't know.

13:47.494 --> 13:48.760
There's a proxy.

13:48.762 --> 13:50.461
And who is the proxy?
Maduro.

13:50.463 --> 13:52.797
Psuv. They're worrying about

13:52.799 --> 13:55.099
The civil unrest in venezuela.

14:00.039 --> 14:01.272
(phone beeps)

14:01.274 --> 14:03.007
(line ringing)

14:03.009 --> 14:04.843
Here. Tell her
you're out.

14:04.845 --> 14:07.612
Tell her not to
contact you again.

14:07.614 --> 14:09.681
What is it, alain?

14:09.683 --> 14:11.282
Alain:
I'm sorry, I'm-I'm afraid

14:11.284 --> 14:12.784
I'm going to have to back out.

14:12.786 --> 14:15.520
What?
Yes, I-I'm afraid it's final.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.155
This is the last time
we will speak.

14:17.157 --> 14:19.357
Do not try to contact me again.

14:30.569 --> 14:34.672
Any attempt to
resuscitate this deal

14:34.674 --> 14:36.708
Will result in your termination.

14:36.710 --> 14:38.810
We have eyes on you
every minute of every day.

14:38.812 --> 14:40.078
Do you understand?

14:40.080 --> 14:41.746
<i>Oui.</i>

14:41.748 --> 14:43.314
That's good.

14:58.497 --> 15:00.999
(chuckles)
I'm gonna tell you something--

15:01.001 --> 15:03.234
You guys got it good
up here in the dco.

15:03.236 --> 15:05.270
Not like that crap we got
downstairs in transpo security.

15:05.272 --> 15:06.938
Laptops are from the 80s.

15:06.940 --> 15:09.574
Let me tell you,
if I had all the...
The point, agent rice.

15:09.576 --> 15:11.276
Like to talk
to one of your agents.

15:11.278 --> 15:12.944
Martin odum.
Why?

15:12.946 --> 15:15.413
Odum came to see me
and asked me about a homicide.

15:15.415 --> 15:18.850
Schizo drifter
named robert mccombs.

15:18.852 --> 15:22.353
Struck me as odd as to why
he was so curious.

15:22.355 --> 15:23.922
Then, days later,

15:23.924 --> 15:26.424
A witness turns up,
shows me this.

15:26.426 --> 15:27.892
This is the crime scene.

15:27.894 --> 15:29.560
The vic is in
the green jacket.

15:29.562 --> 15:30.962
That's him, right? That's odum?

15:30.964 --> 15:32.363
Hard to tell.

15:32.365 --> 15:33.898
Not really.

15:33.900 --> 15:37.035
And I thought it was
kind of suspicious that

15:37.037 --> 15:39.704
Odum never told me he was
on that subway platform.

15:39.706 --> 15:41.306
So I'd like to talk to mr. Odum

15:41.308 --> 15:43.041
And see why he misrepresented
his involvement.

15:43.043 --> 15:45.209
He's unavailable.

15:45.211 --> 15:47.612
Yeah, where is he?

15:47.614 --> 15:50.081
For how long?

15:50.083 --> 15:52.283
You don't have
clearance to know.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.585
This a... Murder case
the dco's working on?

15:54.587 --> 15:56.220
I'm not at liberty to say.

15:56.222 --> 15:57.655
I get it.

15:57.657 --> 16:01.659
Well, when mr. Odum
becomes available...

16:02.761 --> 16:05.430
...Let him know
I'd like to talk to him.

16:05.432 --> 16:07.231
He'll know where to find me.

16:09.501 --> 16:12.503
I know this is a big case.
See, I got video of odum

16:12.505 --> 16:14.238
Kneeling over the victim
as the crime occurred.

16:14.240 --> 16:15.974
I got odum
lying to me

16:15.976 --> 16:17.575
About being there in
the first place.

16:17.577 --> 16:19.310
And I got his boss in the dco

16:19.312 --> 16:20.979
Being tight-lipped and denying
interest in the case.

16:20.981 --> 16:23.982
You were supposed
to take this case to opr...

16:23.984 --> 16:26.184
This is what I think,
okay? I think that we got

16:26.186 --> 16:28.653
Some rogue deep-cover operative
who-who topped some skell.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.688
Right? And now he's being
protected by his boss

16:30.690 --> 16:32.757
In this huge cover-up;
that's what I think.

16:32.759 --> 16:34.292
Yeah, well, you think
a whole lot of things.

16:34.294 --> 16:35.660
Yeah, you know
what else?

16:35.662 --> 16:38.196
Agents don't do
murders in my fbi.

16:38.198 --> 16:40.999
I'm not dropping this case.
You can't arrest an fbi agent

16:41.001 --> 16:42.433
Without a smoking gun
there, fife.

16:42.435 --> 16:43.701
Okay, enough, enough
with the smoking gun.

16:43.703 --> 16:46.170
You know me, okay?
You know me.

16:46.172 --> 16:48.973
And you know what? I'm gonna
get you your evidence.

16:48.975 --> 16:50.141
Good luck.

16:50.143 --> 16:51.142
See? See what you said?

16:51.144 --> 16:52.510
It's a big case.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.012
So tell me something--
what's it like

16:54.014 --> 16:55.713
Overseeing an agent
with my instincts, huh?

16:55.715 --> 16:57.615
It's like a dream, isn't
it? Makes your job easier.

16:57.617 --> 16:58.783
Good-bye, rice.

16:58.785 --> 16:59.784
I love you, too.

16:59.786 --> 17:01.819
Nightmare.

17:01.821 --> 17:04.188
What did you do
to the broker?

17:04.190 --> 17:05.790
Do we need to
pull you out?

17:05.792 --> 17:06.991
I'm not blown.

17:06.993 --> 17:09.794
The frog is out
of the picture.

17:09.796 --> 17:10.962
No. He's not dead.

17:10.964 --> 17:13.164
Paulanos will move quickly

17:13.166 --> 17:14.465
To find another buyer.

17:14.467 --> 17:16.467
Possibly domestic,
for a domestic attack.

17:16.469 --> 17:18.236
I could reach out to her.

17:18.238 --> 17:20.538
If you have another go
at her, she'll spook.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.540
She doesn't want to
hold on to the vx

17:22.542 --> 17:24.475
Any longer than
she has to.

17:24.477 --> 17:27.345
You reach out to ana again,
there will be no deal.

17:27.347 --> 17:29.147
She'll vanish.

17:29.149 --> 17:30.581
She has to come to you.

17:30.583 --> 17:33.051
In the meantime,
we'll keep tabs on her.

17:36.855 --> 17:38.890
Gates thinks
you're up for this.

17:38.892 --> 17:41.092
Hope he's right.

17:54.440 --> 17:56.240
Gates:
<i>Martin,</i>

17:56.242 --> 17:58.576
You wouldn't be the first
undercover agent

17:58.578 --> 18:00.244
To struggle
coming out of a case.

18:00.246 --> 18:02.580
Confusion of identity,
personality dissociation,

18:02.582 --> 18:04.916
Fugue states--
these are recognized risks

18:04.918 --> 18:06.617
For deep-cover
operatives, martin.

18:09.788 --> 18:11.355
Hey.

18:11.357 --> 18:13.524
I'm sorry for coming
around unannounced.

18:13.526 --> 18:14.959
There's a fine line
between spontaneous

18:14.961 --> 18:16.961
And stalking,
martin. Boundaries.

18:16.963 --> 18:18.963
I know, I just need
to talk to you.

18:18.965 --> 18:21.466
You don't look good,
martin. Are you okay?

18:21.468 --> 18:23.301
Just need to ask you
some questions.

18:23.303 --> 18:25.870
I don't have anyone
else to talk to.

18:25.872 --> 18:27.805
Please, sonya.

18:27.807 --> 18:30.308
I-I think something's
happening to me.

18:30.310 --> 18:32.543
I don't know if I'm
this guy or that guy,

18:32.545 --> 18:34.545
Or if this guy's me.

18:34.547 --> 18:37.415
I know it sounds
crazy, but...

18:37.417 --> 18:40.384
I-I just need you
to tell me...

18:40.386 --> 18:41.786
How I proposed.

18:41.788 --> 18:44.155
It was on a
beach, was it?

18:44.157 --> 18:47.892
I-I remember there...
There was a beach. Yeah?

18:47.894 --> 18:50.461
You really don't remember?

18:53.065 --> 18:55.299
It was easter,
your parents' backyard.

18:56.401 --> 18:59.237
Look, aiden's gonna
be out any moment.

18:59.239 --> 19:01.072
I don't want him
seeing you like this.

19:01.074 --> 19:02.406
Us like this.

19:02.408 --> 19:03.841
He's taking this whole thing
really hard.

19:03.843 --> 19:05.409
This is just
gonna upset him.

19:05.411 --> 19:07.411
Dad!

19:07.413 --> 19:08.846
Hey.
(laughs)

19:08.848 --> 19:11.149
Hey, bud.

19:11.151 --> 19:12.750
How was school, huh?

19:12.752 --> 19:14.185
Horrible, of course.
We're still on

19:14.187 --> 19:15.653
For this weekend, right?
I'm staying with you?

19:15.655 --> 19:17.688
Uh, we've got
a problem, pal.

19:17.690 --> 19:19.357
Some... Something's come
up at work, and, uh...

19:19.359 --> 19:21.359
I know.
...I don't think...

19:21.361 --> 19:23.194
It's all right.
Don't worry.

19:23.196 --> 19:24.462
I'll make it up to you.

19:24.464 --> 19:27.265
That's why I came
around today.

19:27.267 --> 19:28.799
To see you.

19:28.801 --> 19:30.134
Come on, let's go.

19:30.136 --> 19:32.170
You're gonna be late.

19:49.988 --> 19:52.190
(phone ringing)

20:03.302 --> 20:05.069
I was hoping you'd call.

20:05.071 --> 20:08.039
I've come across a very
distinctive vintage.

20:08.041 --> 20:10.474
I thought your clients
might be interested.

20:10.476 --> 20:11.876
Depends on the vintage.

20:11.878 --> 20:13.978
Meet me at the 77 grand tonight.

20:13.980 --> 20:16.047
8:00.

20:27.993 --> 20:30.228
(line ringing)

20:30.230 --> 20:31.596
Gates:
Yeah?

20:31.598 --> 20:33.531
Got the call from paulanos.

20:33.533 --> 20:35.266
On for tonight.

20:35.268 --> 20:37.602
I'll brief the crew.

20:39.571 --> 20:41.439
One more thing:
An agent from downstairs

20:41.441 --> 20:42.940
Came to see me about you.

20:42.942 --> 20:44.508
Agent rice?

20:44.510 --> 20:45.943
He'd be the one.

20:45.945 --> 20:47.778
Feel free to get him off my ass

20:47.780 --> 20:49.080
Before he blows my cover.

20:49.082 --> 20:50.281
I'll do what I can.

20:50.283 --> 20:51.582
But when this is over,

20:51.584 --> 20:53.150
We're gonna have
a little sit-down.

20:57.723 --> 21:00.324
(knocking)

21:10.769 --> 21:12.403
Yuri:
Why did the frenchman back out?

21:12.405 --> 21:13.871
Paulanos:
Alain got cold feet,

21:13.873 --> 21:15.439
Buyer didn't materialize.
I don't know.

21:15.441 --> 21:16.741
But he's out.

21:16.743 --> 21:19.243
I can chase him.
Don't be an idiot.

21:19.245 --> 21:20.978
If he comes back to us,
it's with a wire.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.947
I warned you this
might happen.
Yes.

21:22.949 --> 21:25.916
Yuri: And it played out exactly
as I said.

21:25.918 --> 21:28.152
Maggie: I'm plugging the audio
into a word cloud program

21:28.154 --> 21:30.121
That pings key words.

21:30.123 --> 21:31.489
Paulanos:
I know.

21:31.491 --> 21:33.391
I want to make it right.

21:33.393 --> 21:36.193
I have other options
I'm looking into.

21:38.230 --> 21:40.231
Colonel, I know
you're disappointed.

21:40.233 --> 21:41.565
She said "colonel."
it must be

21:41.567 --> 21:43.734
The same guy that
dimitri mentioned.

21:43.736 --> 21:45.670
Yuri: After everything
I've done for you,

21:45.672 --> 21:47.772
I expect more.

21:47.774 --> 21:50.341
I pulled you out
of an orphanage in samashki.

21:50.343 --> 21:51.776
Samashki's in chechnya.

21:51.778 --> 21:53.477
I'm seeing if we have audio
for a voice match.

21:53.479 --> 21:54.912
Great.

21:54.914 --> 21:56.614
Do you know what would have
happened to you

21:56.616 --> 21:59.850
If I hadn't done that,
what your life would have been?

22:01.653 --> 22:04.188
I saved you.

22:05.357 --> 22:06.824
The longer we hold the product,

22:06.826 --> 22:08.659
The greater the risk.

22:08.661 --> 22:10.695
Ultimately,

22:10.697 --> 22:12.963
I won't be
the one bearing it.

22:12.965 --> 22:14.332
If you can't
get this done,

22:14.334 --> 22:16.767
Then I'll start over.

22:16.769 --> 22:18.502
With a clean slate.

22:18.504 --> 22:20.171
I'm sorry.

22:20.173 --> 22:23.541
I know you are.
I know.

22:23.543 --> 22:24.508
(computer beeps)

22:24.510 --> 22:26.243
We've got our colonel.

22:27.379 --> 22:28.512
Call martin,

22:28.514 --> 22:30.581
Fill him in; I'll brief gates.

22:33.352 --> 22:35.953
(squeaking)

22:41.026 --> 22:44.261
(frantic squeaking)

22:49.201 --> 22:51.035
Yuri:
It's not difficult

22:51.037 --> 22:53.070
If you're properly motivated.

22:53.072 --> 22:54.839
It's just the first step.

22:54.841 --> 22:56.841
With this equipment,
I can only make small batches.

22:56.843 --> 22:58.342
You know how
this works.

22:58.344 --> 23:02.213
I also know how you like
to stall, alexander.

23:02.215 --> 23:03.681
The process is what it is.

23:03.683 --> 23:05.383
I'm gonna need another 24 hours,
at least.

23:05.385 --> 23:07.385
You can go
without sleeping.

23:07.387 --> 23:08.753
'cause if
you don't finish

23:08.755 --> 23:10.321
In 18 hours,

23:10.323 --> 23:12.923
You and your family are up
against the wall.

23:12.925 --> 23:16.293
I'll kill
your daughter first.

23:17.095 --> 23:20.297
(speaking russian)

23:31.576 --> 23:33.344
Yuri medved.

23:33.346 --> 23:35.246
He was
a chechen resistance colonel

23:35.248 --> 23:37.515
In the first chechen war
in 1994.

23:37.517 --> 23:39.116
He flipped allegiance
halfway through

23:39.118 --> 23:40.751
And sided
with the russians.

23:40.753 --> 23:43.854
After the war ended, he was
brought to trial for murder.

23:43.856 --> 23:46.724
Specifically for the rape and
killing of a 24-year-old woman

23:46.726 --> 23:48.926
He claimed was a sniper
for the enemy.

23:48.928 --> 23:50.761
Medved served eight years
in an army prison,

23:50.763 --> 23:52.530
Then he bought
his way out.

23:52.532 --> 23:54.298
In the '90s, he was rumored
to be the source

23:54.300 --> 23:56.300
Of some black market
nerve agents out of crimea,

23:56.302 --> 23:59.403
Manufactured by none other
than alexander nevelsky.

23:59.405 --> 24:00.704
Gates: That's our
kidnapped scientist.

24:00.706 --> 24:03.374
With wmd in play,
we need to coordinate

24:03.376 --> 24:06.310
With the wmd directorate,
critical incident,

24:06.312 --> 24:07.745
Brief
the joint task force.

24:07.747 --> 24:10.381
We need an agency-wide response.
Understood,

24:10.383 --> 24:12.750
But we should be careful about
how visible our approach is.

24:12.752 --> 24:15.920
We're at a very fragile stage
in our undercover operation.

24:15.922 --> 24:18.155
Who's under now?
Well, our agent

24:18.157 --> 24:20.224
Has inserted himself
as a broker

24:20.226 --> 24:22.293
Of the deal
involving the vx gas.

24:22.295 --> 24:24.395
Now, if all goes
as planned,

24:24.397 --> 24:25.763
We'll be able
to recover the weapon

24:25.765 --> 24:27.164
And bring down the organization
behind it.

24:27.166 --> 24:29.200
Who's the agent?

24:30.635 --> 24:32.636
Martin odum, sir.

24:32.638 --> 24:34.104
Odum?

24:34.106 --> 24:36.173
Under again so soon?

24:36.175 --> 24:37.508
He's been in legend a week,

24:37.510 --> 24:39.677
And he's already penetrated
the network.

24:39.679 --> 24:41.645
What about you, ms. Mcguire?

24:41.647 --> 24:43.981
What do you think about odum?

24:43.983 --> 24:47.151
He put us on a hot lead
very quickly, no question.

24:47.153 --> 24:48.419
But?

24:48.421 --> 24:51.121
But his approach is unorthodox.

24:51.123 --> 24:52.756
The ends justify the means,
and that puts us...

24:52.758 --> 24:55.159
Our operation ends
with the interdiction of wmd.

24:55.161 --> 24:57.261
Odum is the only agent
I trust with a case

24:57.263 --> 25:00.464
Of this magnitude; I am
comfortable with his tactics.

25:00.466 --> 25:02.466
Give us a week before you start
knocking down doors.

25:02.468 --> 25:03.667
That's all I'm asking.

25:03.669 --> 25:05.102
You have 24 hours.

25:05.104 --> 25:06.737
Get it done.

25:08.206 --> 25:10.207
Hungover at gunpoint
is not ideal, okay?

25:10.209 --> 25:13.277
But there I am, in a
hangar off the tarmac,

25:13.279 --> 25:16.881
And these pla goons force me
to open the cargo hold,

25:16.883 --> 25:18.649
Which is full of
surface-to-air missiles.

25:18.651 --> 25:20.851
I have a warrant for my arrest
out from beijing,

25:20.853 --> 25:23.721
And I get the one captain
in the million-man army

25:23.723 --> 25:24.822
That won't take a bribe.

25:24.824 --> 25:26.524
So what did you do?
I explained

25:26.526 --> 25:29.393
The missiles were cloud seeders,
not munitions at all,

25:29.395 --> 25:32.796
Part of an international
research program to reduce smog.

25:32.798 --> 25:35.566
And they bought it.
(laughs)
completely.

25:35.568 --> 25:37.167
They were all trained
in xingtai.

25:37.169 --> 25:38.669
The air quality there
is horrendous.

25:38.671 --> 25:40.170
They all had
black lung.

25:40.172 --> 25:42.239
They actually thanked me
before letting me go.

25:42.241 --> 25:46.110
(both laughing)

25:47.679 --> 25:50.147
Romance at short notice
is my specialty.

25:50.149 --> 25:51.682
Uh-huh.
(chuckles)

25:51.684 --> 25:54.485
I'm learning more about you
by the moment.

25:54.487 --> 25:57.788
<i>I wonder what other secrets</i>
<i>you're hiding.</i>

26:02.093 --> 26:05.229
Tell me more about your clients.

26:05.231 --> 26:07.565
Known them for years.

26:07.567 --> 26:09.066
Great integrity.

26:09.068 --> 26:10.434
Paulanos:
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

26:10.436 --> 26:13.070
Martin:
<i>Once a deal is struck,</i>
<i>the deal is done.</i>

26:13.072 --> 26:15.739
Are they... Domestic?

26:15.741 --> 26:19.343
Isn't it simpler
if we're all anonymous?

26:19.345 --> 26:22.780
Paulanos: <i>Actually, I'm very</i>
<i>glad to hear you say that.</i>

26:22.782 --> 26:25.783
Tell me about this
vintage of yours.

26:28.186 --> 26:30.588
(quietly):
It's a v-series nerve agent.

26:30.590 --> 26:32.456
An area denial weapon.

26:32.458 --> 26:36.927
This particular lot
is patterned off

26:36.929 --> 26:39.096
A russian process
from the 1990s.

26:39.098 --> 26:40.864
Go on.

26:40.866 --> 26:44.401
The vx has high persistence
in the environment.

26:44.403 --> 26:46.971
It's tasteless, odorless.

26:46.973 --> 26:50.140
It can be distributed
as a spray,

26:50.142 --> 26:51.742
Liquid, aerosol...

26:51.744 --> 26:54.878
I think my clients would be
very interested, actually.

26:56.715 --> 26:58.449
Paulanos:
<i>That's enough about business.</i>

26:58.451 --> 27:00.818
I want to know more about you.

27:01.620 --> 27:02.886
<i>About dante.</i>

27:02.888 --> 27:04.989
Martin:
<i>Well, there's nothing</i>

27:04.991 --> 27:08.325
<i>More to add that you probably</i>
<i>don't already know.</i>

27:09.928 --> 27:11.495
Or won't find out soon enough.

27:11.497 --> 27:13.163
I don't know everything.

27:15.800 --> 27:17.001
Are you married?

27:17.003 --> 27:19.003
I was.

27:19.005 --> 27:22.006
I'm separated right now.

27:22.008 --> 27:24.842
Oh. That's too bad.

27:25.677 --> 27:28.512
You're a closet romantic.

27:28.514 --> 27:30.014
(chuckles)

27:30.016 --> 27:33.017
I bet you proposed in some...

27:33.019 --> 27:35.319
Elaborate way.

27:35.321 --> 27:36.654
Yes.

27:36.656 --> 27:39.023
On a beach, actually.

27:39.025 --> 27:40.658
At sunset.

27:40.660 --> 27:42.493
(chuckles)

27:42.495 --> 27:43.994
Very, uh...

27:43.996 --> 27:46.530
Very elaborate.

27:46.532 --> 27:48.465
Why did it end?

27:48.467 --> 27:53.037
I didn't pay as much attention
to my marriage as I should have.

27:53.039 --> 27:55.806
She deserved better.

27:55.808 --> 27:58.676
If you had it
to do again,

27:58.678 --> 28:00.711
What would you do differently?

28:00.713 --> 28:04.381
I don't know that I could do
anything differently.

28:04.383 --> 28:07.317
I am who I am,
for better or worse.

28:07.319 --> 28:10.621
But that doesn't alleviate
the guilt, does it?

28:13.892 --> 28:15.559
Let's go.

28:15.561 --> 28:16.894
Where are we going?

28:16.896 --> 28:19.463
To consummate the deal.

28:32.210 --> 28:35.079
(elevator bell dings)

28:40.318 --> 28:43.454
â™ª

28:56.000 --> 28:58.569
Do you always sleep
with your business partners?

28:58.571 --> 29:00.671
It's part
of the vetting process.

29:03.575 --> 29:05.809
(door opens)

29:08.613 --> 29:10.347
Evening, agent rice.

29:10.349 --> 29:11.949
Nisco:
I'll leave you boys

29:11.951 --> 29:14.685
To talk.

29:14.687 --> 29:16.553
House calls are below your
pay grade, ain't they, gates?

29:16.555 --> 29:18.222
Not when you're tailing
one of my agents

29:18.224 --> 29:20.190
During an extremely
sensitive operation.

29:20.192 --> 29:22.192
I'm not trying
to step on anybody's toes.

29:22.194 --> 29:25.929
See, martin odum is a material
witness to a brutal homicide

29:25.931 --> 29:27.898
In which he lied

29:27.900 --> 29:29.700
To an investigating
agent.

29:29.702 --> 29:31.568
I have a duty to follow
that case wherever it goes.

29:31.570 --> 29:32.936
Well, the case
he's working on now

29:32.938 --> 29:34.571
Is a hell of a lot
more important.

29:34.573 --> 29:37.541
Literally thousands of lives
could be at stake.

29:37.543 --> 29:39.810
Back off.
I'm not gonna
back off

29:39.812 --> 29:42.780
Until I know why odum was
on that subway platform.

29:42.782 --> 29:46.283
You know, I think
you're a little unsure yourself.

29:46.285 --> 29:48.652
That's why you're here.
You got five reprimands,

29:48.654 --> 29:50.254
One for use of excessive force.

29:50.256 --> 29:52.222
Seems to me
you tend to overdo things,

29:52.224 --> 29:53.924
Which is probably why
you haven't been promoted.

29:53.926 --> 29:56.059
You writing a book?
Tack on obstruction

29:56.061 --> 29:58.662
Of a federal investigation
charge to your rÃ©sumÃ©,

29:58.664 --> 30:01.965
And then your job prospects
turn into, well...

30:01.967 --> 30:04.001
What job?

30:05.436 --> 30:06.637
Daddy, I can't sleep.

30:06.639 --> 30:08.105
Go back upstairs,
sweetie.

30:08.107 --> 30:09.339
I'll be up in a second, okay?

30:09.341 --> 30:11.575
Okay.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.845
Nice family.

30:14.847 --> 30:17.347
Don't make me an enemy.

30:26.791 --> 30:29.026
(scraping)

30:35.033 --> 30:37.234
(phone buzzing)

30:54.986 --> 30:57.621
There's someone
I'd like you to meet

30:57.623 --> 30:58.856
Tonight.

30:58.858 --> 31:00.624
Good.

31:00.626 --> 31:02.226
What do we have?

31:02.228 --> 31:03.493
Martin's in.

31:03.495 --> 31:06.430
Paulanos wants him
to meet the supplier.

31:07.565 --> 31:09.466
I'll pick you up at 7:00.

31:09.468 --> 31:11.268
Okay.

31:14.339 --> 31:15.906
I really enjoyed
last night.

31:15.908 --> 31:18.375
Yeah, me, too.

31:18.377 --> 31:20.744
Hmm.

31:20.746 --> 31:22.679
(chuckles)

31:22.681 --> 31:24.815
Gates:
Martin can't risk being exposed

31:24.817 --> 31:27.851
As an undercover operative, not
<i>with the vx still out there.</i>

31:27.853 --> 31:31.555
<i>That means no wire,</i>
<i>no follow team.</i>

31:31.557 --> 31:33.790
Cell phone, gun.
Give me everything.

31:37.862 --> 31:40.130
Put it on.

31:42.200 --> 31:45.035
Gates: <i>We'll track the transport</i>
<i>vehicle via satellite,</i>

31:45.037 --> 31:47.237
<i>But he'll be on his own.</i>

31:47.239 --> 31:49.172
Maggie:
I have a lock on martin.

31:49.174 --> 31:51.408
(computer beeps)

31:51.410 --> 31:53.577
He's leaving downtown,

31:53.579 --> 31:56.146
Heading east towards echo park.

32:00.919 --> 32:03.921
I just pinned a number that

32:03.923 --> 32:07.024
Paulanos dialed three times on
the day of hubbard's kidnapping.

32:07.026 --> 32:09.259
It's the opposite direction
from where martin's headed,

32:09.261 --> 32:10.894
But it looks
like a warehouse.

32:10.896 --> 32:12.596
Isolated, secure.

32:12.598 --> 32:14.731
Guarantee that's our lab.

32:14.733 --> 32:16.733
Yeah, they could be holding
the hubbard family there.

32:16.735 --> 32:19.403
We've got about ten hours
before spiller takes this over.

32:19.405 --> 32:21.939
Let's get a tac team
down there now.

32:21.941 --> 32:24.007
Maggie, set up
mobile command.

32:25.944 --> 32:27.544
What, are we driving
in circles?

32:27.546 --> 32:29.846
I don't have anyone
following me.

32:33.751 --> 32:36.453
Crystal: Alpha team,
what do you have for us?

32:36.455 --> 32:39.089
I've got three bogeys
outside the warehouse,

32:39.091 --> 32:41.058
Armed and hot.
Defensive posture.

32:41.060 --> 32:42.626
They're definitely
guarding something.

32:42.628 --> 32:44.094
You seeing this?

32:44.096 --> 32:46.296
The hot spot is registering
at over 300 degrees.

32:46.298 --> 32:48.966
Vx gas requires
sustained high temperatures.

32:48.968 --> 32:51.735
That's the lab where
they're making the nerve gas.

32:51.737 --> 32:54.137
That means hubbard's there.
Maybe his family, too.

32:54.139 --> 32:55.605
Jam the nearby cell towers.

32:55.607 --> 32:57.274
I want an eight-block radius

32:57.276 --> 32:59.276
To go dark to all wireless
traffic, you understand?

32:59.278 --> 33:01.645
I don't want the chechens
tipping anyone that we hit them,

33:01.647 --> 33:03.480
Then have that boomerang
onto martin.

33:03.482 --> 33:05.582
I'll put the warehouse
in a black hole.

33:05.584 --> 33:06.717
Gates:
Crystal, let's go.

33:09.354 --> 33:11.154
Crystal:
Alpha team approaching
standby position.

33:11.156 --> 33:12.622
Maggie:
All wireless jammed.

33:12.624 --> 33:14.825
Gates:
Engage hostiles. Shoot to kill.

33:14.827 --> 33:17.060
(silenced gunfire, grunting)

33:19.163 --> 33:21.631
Crystal:
Keep the masks and gloves on

33:21.633 --> 33:23.266
Until you're clear
of the building.

33:23.268 --> 33:24.701
If you're exposed
to the nerve agent,

33:24.703 --> 33:27.237
Inject the atropine right away.

33:31.843 --> 33:32.642
Move in. Move in.

33:32.644 --> 33:35.379
Man:
Go! Go! Go! Go!

33:35.381 --> 33:36.580
Watch your six.

33:40.385 --> 33:42.552
(rapid gunfire)

33:50.695 --> 33:53.463
Man:
Bogeys down.
Moving into the east corridor.

33:53.465 --> 33:56.266
East corridor. Looks clear.

33:57.535 --> 33:59.569
Check the corner.

33:59.571 --> 34:02.072
(gunfire)

34:05.410 --> 34:06.943
Aah!
Man:
Nail that guy.

34:07.645 --> 34:08.879
Nice shot, mcguire.

34:08.881 --> 34:11.081
Mitch, find the hubbards.

34:11.083 --> 34:12.516
We're going for the lab.

34:12.518 --> 34:15.018
Copy that.

34:15.020 --> 34:16.920
Maggie: Crystal, that hot spot
should be dead ahead.

34:16.922 --> 34:20.390
Got it. Bravo's moving east.

34:20.392 --> 34:21.892
Approaching hot spot.

34:21.894 --> 34:24.161
Command, we found the lab.

34:24.163 --> 34:25.562
Gates:
Crystal, check around.

34:25.564 --> 34:26.696
Any sign of the vx?

34:26.698 --> 34:29.833
Stand by.
We're checking.

34:31.402 --> 34:33.737
I'll cover you. Go.

34:41.446 --> 34:44.581
(yelling)

34:44.583 --> 34:46.783
(gasps)
richard hubbard?

34:46.785 --> 34:49.086
Maggie, hubbard says

34:49.088 --> 34:51.688
His wife and daughter are locked
in the west corridor.

34:51.690 --> 34:53.023
Alpha team leader, do you copy?

34:53.025 --> 34:55.092
Copy that.
We're in the west corridor.

34:55.094 --> 34:56.159
Bogey, one o'clock.

35:00.465 --> 35:02.332
Clear!

35:09.440 --> 35:11.475
You're okay now.
We're gonna get you out of here.

35:11.477 --> 35:13.543
We've got the mother and
daughter; extracting them now.

35:13.545 --> 35:15.812
Where's my husband?
Is richard okay?

35:15.814 --> 35:18.248
Stand down. Building's clear.

35:18.250 --> 35:20.050
Command, this is
alpha team leader.

35:20.052 --> 35:21.751
We've been all over this place;
there is no vx here.

35:21.753 --> 35:25.122
I repeat,
there is no sign of the vx.

35:25.124 --> 35:27.557
Susan! Jane!
Dad!

35:27.559 --> 35:29.659
Oh.
(sobbing)

35:29.661 --> 35:31.595
Richard:
I'm so sorry.

35:31.597 --> 35:34.231
They must have already moved
the vx.

35:41.105 --> 35:43.140
(gunfire)

35:43.142 --> 35:45.408
(people shouting)

35:53.451 --> 35:55.752
I guess it's up
to martin now.

36:00.691 --> 36:02.826
(tires screeching)

36:06.264 --> 36:08.765
Take it off.

36:33.791 --> 36:36.393
It's interesting timing,
you coming out of the woodwork

36:36.395 --> 36:38.528
Right when
my recent buyer vanished.

36:38.530 --> 36:42.265
I didn't know you
had another buyer.

36:44.035 --> 36:46.236
I'm, uh... I'm
dante, by the way.

36:46.238 --> 36:49.206
Ana tells me you spent time
in federal prison.

36:49.208 --> 36:51.841
Yes. So?

36:51.843 --> 36:53.977
Well, it's a common practice
of the fbi

36:53.979 --> 36:58.315
To turn prisoners in exchange
for reduced prison sentences.

36:59.250 --> 37:02.185
What is this?

37:02.187 --> 37:05.655
I didn't come here
for an inquisition.

37:05.657 --> 37:08.258
Other than khalid,
who knows you?

37:08.260 --> 37:11.061
Who knows <i>you?</i>

37:11.063 --> 37:14.030
How do I know you don't have
some side deal with immigration

37:14.032 --> 37:15.865
To look away at
a few checkpoints,

37:15.867 --> 37:18.168
Give them a limey
broker in exchange?

37:19.904 --> 37:22.672
Huh. Hey, look,
I'm not wired.

37:22.674 --> 37:25.275
I've nothing to hide. What
about you? What have you got?

37:25.277 --> 37:26.676
(grunts)

37:31.182 --> 37:33.883
Go ahead, shoot.

37:33.885 --> 37:35.752
I'll splatter your boss
all over the walls.

37:39.090 --> 37:41.124
You don't trust
me, kill me.

37:41.126 --> 37:42.592
We'll both die together.

37:42.594 --> 37:45.595
Or we can sit down, make
each other some money.

38:04.782 --> 38:06.583
My buyers are prepared
to wire ten percent

38:06.585 --> 38:08.918
Of the purchase price as soon
as I leave this building.

38:08.920 --> 38:13.156
But they require some proof
that you've got the goods.

38:13.158 --> 38:15.725
Very well.

38:21.299 --> 38:23.533
(muffled groaning, panting)

38:30.675 --> 38:32.909
A single drop

38:32.911 --> 38:34.844
On the skin

38:34.846 --> 38:36.513
Is enough to kill.

38:36.515 --> 38:39.516
You should try the product
before you buy.

38:39.518 --> 38:42.018
(muffled groaning)

38:42.020 --> 38:44.187
Who is he?

38:44.189 --> 38:45.755
Not your concern.

38:47.525 --> 38:48.992
What did he do to you?

38:48.994 --> 38:50.593
He disappointed me.

38:51.696 --> 38:53.663
Please don't shed a tear.

38:57.968 --> 38:59.602
I want you to
do the honors.

38:59.604 --> 39:02.372
And then what?

39:02.374 --> 39:06.109
I do the business,
and he lives?

39:06.111 --> 39:07.777
I'm guessing not.

39:07.779 --> 39:10.313
Because no vx, no deal.

39:10.315 --> 39:13.049
And that's pretty shit
for us both, isn't it?

39:13.051 --> 39:14.617
You wouldn't go
to the trouble if you knew

39:14.619 --> 39:16.386
Your product
wasn't gonna work.

39:16.388 --> 39:17.854
I know it will work, yes,

39:17.856 --> 39:19.189
But I'm not trying

39:19.191 --> 39:20.824
To prove this to
you, mr. Auerbach.

39:20.826 --> 39:23.460
I want you
to prove something to me.

39:23.462 --> 39:24.961
I'm a businessman, not a killer.

39:24.963 --> 39:26.596
Do your own dirty work.

39:31.068 --> 39:33.603
I insist.

39:37.174 --> 39:40.310
(scoffs)

39:45.983 --> 39:47.817
(speaking russian)

39:47.819 --> 39:49.486
(muffled groaning)

40:02.566 --> 40:05.769
But on his skin, it's too slow.
Put it in the eye.

40:05.771 --> 40:08.905
(muffled groaning continues)

40:16.414 --> 40:18.481
Man:
Open his eye.

40:23.354 --> 40:25.488
(muffled screaming)

40:35.866 --> 40:38.435
Now we have trust.

40:38.437 --> 40:40.370
