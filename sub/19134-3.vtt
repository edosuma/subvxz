00:07.292 --> 00:08.425
<i>Okay, so here's the thing.</i>

00:08.460 --> 00:09.826
<i>I can't really touch the knife.</i>

00:09.862 --> 00:11.228
<i>We need the power of a god.</i>

00:11.263 --> 00:14.464
I have gifted you my
Bestowal. Imbibe it.

00:14.500 --> 00:16.967
The more it burns,
the less time we have.

00:17.002 --> 00:18.735
There's a spell that
seems strong enough.

00:18.771 --> 00:19.970
These are my students.

00:20.005 --> 00:21.738
They are in need of the Rhinemann Ultra.

within 20 feet of the blast.</i>

This is a cacodemon.

00:30.349 --> 00:31.349

00:31.383 --> 00:32.816
Unleash these, and believe me,

00:50.302 --> 00:52.536
- Wow.
- I owe you for real.

00:52.571 --> 00:54.449
You could die if you don't
get clear of The Beast.

00:54.473 --> 00:56.273
You think I don't know
how dangerous he is?

00:56.308 --> 00:58.041
No. Not him. Us.

00:58.076 --> 00:59.543
Yeah, do what you want with him,

01:02.014 --> 01:03.814
A god can resist.

01:03.849 --> 01:05.549
I don't give a shit about getting him.

- You should.
- I didn't summon him.

01:21.867 --> 01:23.967
is called the Rhinemann Ultra?

01:24.185 --> 01:25.735
Sounds like a not-so-great beer.

01:25.771 --> 01:27.649
Fine, it's a beer, but
it's a beer that we can use

01:27.673 --> 01:29.517
- to kill The Beast.
- Meanwhile, Penny comes back

01:29.541 --> 01:31.675
with cool circa-1985 wrist chains.

01:31.710 --> 01:33.656
Yeah, super cool how they
keep me from killing myself.

01:33.680 --> 01:35.758
And then Dean Fogg gives you
all matching tramp stamps?

01:35.781 --> 01:37.147
I thought tramp stamps

01:37.182 --> 01:38.849
were supposed to be on our lower back?

01:38.884 --> 01:40.762

Come. Sit.

02:12.784 --> 02:14.751
Wait, is this really
the most important thing

02:14.786 --> 02:16.119
we could be doing right now?

02:16.154 --> 02:19.105
I mean, The Beast is still out there
waiting for us...

02:19.130 --> 02:20.660
The Beast can wait for five minutes.

02:20.699 --> 02:23.426
You are all Kings and Queens of Fillory.

02:23.613 --> 02:25.228

03:00.265 --> 03:01.309
Yeah, we already talked strategy,

you're three against one.

03:28.493 --> 03:30.515
- Don't touch me.
- Sweetie?

03:31.218 --> 03:33.263

make a lot of sense.

04:06.225 --> 04:07.897
- You talked to that bitch?
- Yes, he did.

04:07.933 --> 04:10.133
It was a warning.
Something The Beast said.

04:10.168 --> 04:13.169
Uh... God, of course. It makes sense.

04:13.205 --> 04:15.080
I mean, he'd want to
booby-trap his kingdom, right?

04:15.104 --> 04:19.009
So apparently, he left curses behind.

04:19.463 --> 04:21.211

04:27.455 --> 04:28.518

04:28.553 --> 04:30.387
that Eliot started acting strangely

04:30.422 --> 04:32.713
once he took a drink from the goblet?

04:33.651 --> 04:37.794
I mean, it could be poison or a potion.

04:40.448 --> 04:43.533
All right, well, we probably shouldn't
drink from ours just to be safe.

04:43.568 --> 04:44.779

04:44.803 --> 04:46.247
Fillorian shit that went up his nose,

04:46.271 --> 04:47.963

04:52.049 --> 04:53.276

Nope. Nothing.

- We have to kill him.

For the poison.

of it being trapped in there.

22:20.364 --> 22:22.331

- Just leave her alone.

It's not like you
have yours. I do, so...

22:35.913 --> 22:37.479

22:37.616 --> 22:39.114
It's a simple spell,

22:39.149 --> 22:40.527
but that doesn't mean it's not powerful.

22:40.551 --> 22:42.295
Especially if all three
of us are casting it.

22:42.319 --> 22:45.287

22:58.202 --> 22:59.879
With one dick, you're
just jerking yourself off,

23:09.546 --> 23:10.645
It doesn't have to.
