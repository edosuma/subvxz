03:17.980 --> 03:19.721
We could do with more shells.

03:20.330 --> 03:23.246
Them little ammonites,tourist tut.

03:24.639 --> 03:26.118
And driftwood.

[man] No, please,
don'’t let me disturb you.

09:36.010 --> 09:39.230
-I am very content
to watch you work.
-The shop'’s closed, sir.

09:39.274 --> 09:40.928
It'’s wonderful, isn't it?

09:40.971 --> 09:42.451
<i>Cornu ammonis?</i>

09:42.494 --> 09:43.800
Ammonite.

09:45.149 --> 09:46.324
It'’s a broken one.

09:46.368 --> 09:48.022
It'’s still a fine specimen.

09:48.065 --> 09:49.414
Is there something
you wanted, sir?

09:50.546 --> 09:54.289
Sorry. Please, let meintroduce myself, Miss Anning.Roderick Murchison.

09:58.206 --> 10:00.774
I must confess
I'’m a little in awe.

10:00.817 --> 10:04.125
Your reputation is somethingI'’ve often heard discussed

10:04.168 --> 10:05.953
in the Geographical Societyin London.

10:07.389 --> 10:10.087
All boys together.Yes, well...

10:10.131 --> 10:11.611
Quite.

10:12.220 --> 10:15.397
But your insights,
your skills,
are legendary

10:15.440 --> 10:19.270
and I thoughtfor my archaeological tourof the Continent,

10:19.314 --> 10:23.100
how could I miss
the opportunity
to meet you?

10:23.144 --> 10:25.450
And here you are.

10:25.494 --> 10:26.669
At your work.

10:27.365 --> 10:29.759
I was under the impressionthat fine London gentlemen

10:29.803 --> 10:32.327
were no longer interestedin my sea creature relics.

10:32.806 --> 10:35.417
Fashion moved on, did it not?

10:36.418 --> 10:39.943
Quite. I'’m afraidI'’m a bit of a late starter.

10:39.987 --> 10:42.424
And how could I
not want to meet

10:42.467 --> 10:44.469
"the presiding deity of Lyme"?

10:45.470 --> 10:49.649
It'’d be customary
for a gentleman
to write to me

10:50.214 --> 10:53.261
to make an appointmentbefore arriving unannounced.

10:53.304 --> 10:55.872
-Yes, unforgivable.
-Could you not
fiddle with that?

10:57.569 --> 11:01.617
Sorry.May I introduce my wife,Mrs. Charlotte Murchison?

11:07.884 --> 11:10.713
Sir, as you can see,I don'’t excavatelarger pieces any more.

11:10.757 --> 11:13.673
I'’ve seen
that particular relic
in the British Museum.

11:13.716 --> 11:15.936
A complete ichthyosaurus.
Am I correct?

11:16.893 --> 11:18.634
And that'’s one of yours?

11:21.376 --> 11:22.551
It'’s fascinating.

11:23.770 --> 11:29.601
I would love to purchase
this ammonite from you,
but I must be honest.

11:29.645 --> 11:33.040
What I would dearly appreciateis the opportunity

11:33.083 --> 11:36.391
to spend some time working
with you on the shore,

11:36.434 --> 11:38.001
seeing what you see.

11:42.049 --> 11:43.964
I don'’t conduct
guided tours any more.

11:44.007 --> 11:47.054
I'’m not a tourist, Miss Anning,I'’m a scientist, like you.

11:47.097 --> 11:50.927
A man of the new world
and I'’m here to learn
all I can from you.

11:51.754 --> 11:56.411
And, of course,I am more than happy torecompense you for your time.

11:57.717 --> 12:01.198
And, obviously,
as it'’s an inconvenience
to yourself,

12:01.242 --> 12:04.332
I would be able
to pay a premium
for a private audience.

12:04.898 --> 12:08.684
As well as the purchase
of this fine ammonite,
of course.

12:11.556 --> 12:12.601
It'’s not easy work.

12:13.907 --> 12:15.865
-Good.
-I can'’t promise
we'’ll find anything.

12:17.258 --> 12:18.302
Naturally.

12:21.958 --> 12:24.439
Very well.Splendid!

12:28.617 --> 12:31.533
-You'’ve no idea
what this means to me.
-[bell rings]

13:38.382 --> 13:41.342
-Do you have
a quieter dining room?
-Yes, sir, but--

13:41.385 --> 13:44.693
This music'’s
a little overwhelming
for the situation.

13:44.736 --> 13:46.086
-Couldn'’t we--
-Don'’t make a fuss.

13:58.707 --> 14:00.709
[Roderick] What is the soup?[waiter] Hare.

14:01.188 --> 14:02.754
I'’ll have the oysters.
Are they larded?

14:02.798 --> 14:04.191
A la mode, sir.

14:04.234 --> 14:07.455
Perfect. And the beef. Rare.

14:07.498 --> 14:10.110
[waiter] Very good, sir.Braised celery,boiled potatoes.

14:10.153 --> 14:13.156
Pouring cream for the potatoes.Would you bring your wine list?

14:13.200 --> 14:15.593
No, wait. Just bring me
a bottle of the claret.

14:15.637 --> 14:18.553
[waiter] We havethe '’26 or '35.

14:20.033 --> 14:21.556
[Roderick] The '’35.

14:25.212 --> 14:28.693
And my wife will have
some plain white fish.
Baked. No sauce.

17:10.551 --> 17:12.074
Sorry. Am I late?

17:12.118 --> 17:14.772
The old woman
in your shop--My mother.

17:14.816 --> 17:16.513
Of course.
I do beg your pardon.

17:16.557 --> 17:18.907
Your mother said
I would find you here.

17:19.647 --> 17:23.172
It was a bright morning,
and the tide was out.
I couldn'’t wait.

17:23.868 --> 17:27.133
Yes, of course.
I just didn'’t want
to miss anything.

17:29.135 --> 17:30.136
Well, you'’re here now.

17:31.876 --> 17:33.052
Yes.

17:38.231 --> 17:39.536
[clears throat]

17:58.468 --> 17:59.382
Nothing.

18:01.558 --> 18:02.472
Beef.

18:03.821 --> 18:04.735
Limestone.

18:05.562 --> 18:07.477
Calcite crystal.And this?

18:11.481 --> 18:12.569
Look here.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.832
There is
a little ammonite inside,

18:14.876 --> 18:17.792
but that dimpletells me it will be crushed.

18:19.185 --> 18:20.969
You could chip it out,but it won'’t be any good.

18:24.320 --> 18:25.321
Oh, that'’s nice.

18:26.496 --> 18:28.672
Coprolite. Very nice.

18:28.716 --> 18:30.674
I'’m not familiar
with this type.

18:31.588 --> 18:32.894
If you look very carefully,

18:33.895 --> 18:36.289
you can see tiny fish bones.

18:39.770 --> 18:41.250
Those little black flecks...

18:42.469 --> 18:43.644
they'’re scales.

18:43.687 --> 18:45.472
That'’ll polish up very nice.

18:45.515 --> 18:46.951
Thank you.

18:46.995 --> 18:49.606
-But what is it?
-Fossilized feces.

18:50.085 --> 18:52.174
Pardon?Yes, Mr. Murchison.

18:52.914 --> 18:53.958
Shit.

18:54.872 --> 18:57.614
The tide will be coming in soon.We ought to be getting back.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.455
[door closes]Charlotte.

19:17.068 --> 19:19.723
-What are you doing?
-Taking you out
of this stinking room.

19:19.767 --> 19:22.726
-I don'’t want to.-I'’m afraidthat'’s no longer a choice.

19:32.693 --> 19:33.781
[sighs]

19:59.110 --> 20:01.678
We can'’t continue
like this, Charlotte.
You'’re like a shadow.

20:02.244 --> 20:03.724
It simply won'’t do.

20:03.767 --> 20:05.421
It'’s madness for meto expect you

20:05.465 --> 20:07.902
to be well enoughto accompany me abroad.

20:07.945 --> 20:11.297
It seems you need more timefor your convalescence.Roddy...

20:13.864 --> 20:16.911
Lyme appears to be
the perfect place for you.

20:28.662 --> 20:29.967
[man shouts in the distance]

20:40.064 --> 20:41.849
This expedition is extensive.

20:42.850 --> 20:44.852
You were prescribed rest.

20:45.331 --> 20:47.376
Sea bathing.I don'’t like the water.

20:47.420 --> 20:48.899
Little stimulation.

20:49.552 --> 20:53.469
I want my bright, funny,
clever wife back.

20:58.648 --> 21:00.433
I don'’t want to be alone.

21:27.373 --> 21:28.417
Is there something else?

21:32.900 --> 21:34.641
My wife, Charlotte,

21:34.684 --> 21:37.078
she hasn'’t been
at all well of late.

21:37.121 --> 21:39.123
She suffers...

21:39.950 --> 21:42.692
Well, it'’s
mild melancholia, perhaps.

21:43.998 --> 21:46.000
The doctor prescribed
taking the sea air,

21:46.043 --> 21:47.741
but it has been a little slow.

21:48.263 --> 21:51.745
I have arranged for her
to stay on in Lyme,

21:52.572 --> 21:56.532
and although I'’m reassured
that she will be
well cared for,

21:56.576 --> 21:58.491
she would be alone.

21:59.100 --> 22:03.104
I was thinking...
hoping, really,

22:04.497 --> 22:08.283
what a wonderful opportunity
it would be for her

22:08.327 --> 22:10.198
to walk out with you.

22:11.808 --> 22:13.332
Walk out?Yes.

22:14.028 --> 22:15.986
Walk the shoreline with you.

22:16.030 --> 22:18.815
Learn from you.I'’m not looking
for an apprentice.

22:18.859 --> 22:21.165
No, of course not.I am in no position

22:21.209 --> 22:22.689
to spend my days
caring for an invalid.

22:22.732 --> 22:27.171
No, and...
it wouldn'’t require you to.

22:27.650 --> 22:32.829
You showed me
such courtesy yesterday,
sharing your knowledge,

22:32.873 --> 22:38.095
and I was hoping that
you might be able to afford
my wife the same generosity.

22:38.922 --> 22:43.318
You'’ll help give her
an interest, as it were.

22:45.494 --> 22:49.063
And it would only be for...
four weeks.

22:49.106 --> 22:50.673
Perhaps five.

22:51.935 --> 22:53.110
But no more than six.

23:05.819 --> 23:08.082
[knocking at door]

23:12.042 --> 23:15.481
Excuse me, Mrs. Murchison,but Mr. Murchison instructed me

23:15.524 --> 23:17.221
to help you dressfor your day out today.

23:17.265 --> 23:18.745
[sighs] I'’m not going.

23:18.788 --> 23:20.964
I'’m very sorry,Mrs. Murchison,

23:21.008 --> 23:22.618
but Mr. Murchisonwas most insistent

23:22.662 --> 23:24.925
I get you up out of bedand dressed immediately.

23:24.968 --> 23:26.274
[clattering]

What is it?

27:37.133 --> 27:39.309
Something. Nothing.

27:40.049 --> 27:41.355
Shouldn'’t you excavate it?

27:42.791 --> 27:44.706
I mean,
isn'’t that what you do?

27:44.750 --> 27:47.100
My husband said that'’s what
you'’re meant to show me.

27:47.143 --> 27:50.364
Let me be clear.I don'’t want you here.

27:51.626 --> 27:53.454
Your husband paid meto take you out with me.

27:53.497 --> 27:55.891
Doesn'’t matter to meif you wanna be here or not.

27:55.935 --> 27:59.199
But please don'’t questionor presume to tell mehow I conduct my business.

27:59.242 --> 28:03.203
I came to get help
with my illness.
To bathe and to walk.

28:03.246 --> 28:05.553
Not work like a navvy.Bathe?

28:06.206 --> 28:09.078
Then may I suggest you rid meof your bad companyand go get better bathing.

28:09.122 --> 28:11.298
-My husband--
-Your husband left you.

31:46.165 --> 31:48.123
Uh... yes.

31:55.391 --> 31:57.176
There appears to bea high fever.

31:57.219 --> 31:59.482
Did she take a chill yesterday?

31:59.526 --> 32:03.269
Get wet in
the rain, perhaps?I don'’t know.

32:06.011 --> 32:07.142
Maybe she went bathing.

32:07.838 --> 32:10.276
Oh, yes, water torture.

32:10.929 --> 32:12.887
[sighs] She'’ll need care.

32:13.366 --> 32:15.629
Night and day.I'’m not a nurse, Doctor.

32:16.456 --> 32:17.892
I barely know the woman.

32:18.806 --> 32:21.156
Hmm. Um...

32:21.983 --> 32:23.028
Yes.

32:25.856 --> 32:26.770
Miss Anning,

32:28.250 --> 32:32.863
it is a woman'’s position
to care for a fellow sister,
is it not?

32:40.828 --> 32:43.744
Make sure you keep her warm,but not too hot.

32:43.787 --> 32:47.008
And cold compressesshould help relieve the fever.

32:47.052 --> 32:50.055
I'’ll write to her husband
and send for her things.

32:50.098 --> 32:52.796
And please do call for me
if her condition changes.

32:57.105 --> 32:58.324
I'’ll bid you a good afternoon.

33:09.335 --> 33:10.466
[door opens]

33:22.174 --> 33:25.046
How long is she intending
on being in residence?

33:25.090 --> 33:28.702
You should send her home...
to that London.

33:29.355 --> 33:31.009
It'’s not our responsibility.

33:32.358 --> 33:34.099
She might die, Mother.

33:34.142 --> 33:36.666
How are we to survivewhile you play lady'’s maid?

33:36.710 --> 33:38.364
We'’ll manage.

33:38.407 --> 33:40.801
[Molly] If she is to beaccommodated in my home,

33:41.454 --> 33:45.153

35:06.843 --> 35:08.106
I didn'’t...

35:09.368 --> 35:11.021
I didn'’t see her...

35:15.156 --> 35:16.462
in the ground.

35:21.728 --> 35:22.990
It was cold.

I need to purchase
a jar of salve, please.

It'’s not your ma again?
Poor Molly. Is she worse?

37:15.972 --> 37:17.191
Do you want to come in?

37:17.974 --> 37:19.106
Just the salve.

37:21.326 --> 37:22.327
You look well.

37:23.719 --> 37:26.026
I like your hair longer.
It suits you.

37:28.985 --> 37:30.944
I haven'’t seen you in church
for some time.

37:32.511 --> 37:34.164
Well, I'’ve had my work.

You know you can
always ask me for help.

37:44.827 --> 37:46.699
I don'’t think that'd besuch a good idea.

37:48.788 --> 37:50.659
I came for the salve,
not a sermon.

37:52.661 --> 37:53.836
I understand.

38:06.588 --> 38:09.896
Keep your coins.
They'’re hard earned.

38:16.424 --> 38:17.425
Mary...

You sure you don'’t want
to come in?

41:22.349 --> 41:24.438
Miss Anning,
I must commend you.

41:24.482 --> 41:26.919
I did not expect
to see Mrs. Murchison

41:26.962 --> 41:29.269
looking quiteas radiant as she does.

41:30.270 --> 41:32.664
Really. Wonderful work.

41:32.707 --> 41:34.187
Good.

Excellent.

41:36.885 --> 41:38.408

44:17.089 --> 44:18.264
Just take the air.

If you think I'’m strong enough.

44:21.963 --> 44:23.182

you'’re strong enough?

Can I try?

Use this...

You look after melike your child.

50:41.125 --> 50:42.169
You don'’t have any?

50:43.127 --> 50:44.563
What a lot of questions.

50:45.607 --> 50:47.740
I might have preferred it
when you were unconscious.

No.

For what?

51:08.195 --> 51:09.762
My mother had ten.

And two before me.

of her when they went.

51:31.566 --> 51:32.959
I have my work.

51:35.179 --> 51:37.137
I didn'’t need children
as well.

52:07.080 --> 52:09.126
You can'’t keep sleeping
in that chair.

52:10.388 --> 52:12.912
You need your rest.I'’ve taken your bedfor too long.

52:14.131 --> 52:16.133
Did you want to go back
to the hotel?

52:17.438 --> 52:18.570
[Charlotte] No.

52:21.268 --> 52:22.835
Unless you want me to.

52:24.576 --> 52:25.620
No.

52:31.060 --> 52:32.105
We should share the bed.

Dr. Lieberson has come
to see you.

Oh, no. Sorry.

54:54.160 --> 54:55.901

54:56.902 --> 55:02.124
My mission was to give thisto you, Miss Anning.

55:04.562 --> 55:05.954
It'’s an invitation.

55:05.998 --> 55:07.782
A musical evening.

55:08.479 --> 55:11.264
I thought after all your workwith Mrs. Murchison,

55:11.308 --> 55:14.746
you might like a little treat.

55:14.789 --> 55:16.095
What about Mrs. Murchison?

55:17.792 --> 55:19.664
Pardon?I'’m not sure I understand.

55:20.404 --> 55:23.232
Well, Mrs. Murchison
appreciates music much more
than I do.

55:23.276 --> 55:25.670
Where'’s her invitation?

55:25.713 --> 55:28.629
I would naturally beaccompanied by Mrs. Murchisonin her own right.

55:28.673 --> 55:30.979
Do you not think?Yes.

55:31.023 --> 55:34.896
I just thought givenMrs. Murchison'’s condition,

55:34.940 --> 55:39.423
this might provea little... overstimulating.

55:39.466 --> 55:40.989
Rubbish.

55:41.555 --> 55:43.818
As her doctor, I wouldstrongly advise against it.

55:43.862 --> 55:45.472
And as her friend, I disagree.

55:46.517 --> 55:49.215
Dr. Lieberson, I will
happily attend your recital.

55:50.564 --> 55:52.000
But with Mrs. Murchison.

55:56.918 --> 55:59.268

What is it?

1:08:04.819 --> 1:08:08.649
See here? This is a rowof small vertebrae.

1:08:09.172 --> 1:08:13.219
And these flatter sidesare where the ribswould have been attached.

1:08:14.090 --> 1:08:16.135
But these ones have
a certain shape,

1:08:17.484 --> 1:08:21.184
which tells methey would have beennear the skull.

1:08:21.227 --> 1:08:22.663
And that'’s good?

1:08:24.839 --> 1:08:27.320
It would be very good, yes.

1:08:37.025 --> 1:08:38.636
That one was special.

1:08:41.943 --> 1:08:43.249
I was only 11 years old.

1:08:44.729 --> 1:08:49.125
Days it took to dig it out,clean it.

1:08:50.778 --> 1:08:52.084
I'’d like to see it.

1:08:52.737 --> 1:08:54.304
It'’s in The British Museum

1:08:54.347 --> 1:08:57.872
with its fancy made-up name.Ichthyosaurus.

1:09:03.617 --> 1:09:09.188
We couldn'’t keep it.It was a year'’s worth of food,rent and clothing.

1:09:13.845 --> 1:09:15.499
That'’s such a poor drawing.

1:09:17.240 --> 1:09:19.067
A child'’s hand.

1:09:20.634 --> 1:09:21.853
I like it.

1:09:26.336 --> 1:09:28.642
I'’m pleased my rock
was worth the work.

1:09:48.923 --> 1:09:50.577
[fossil thuds on the table]

1:10:02.285 --> 1:10:03.503
You found the head.

1:10:08.726 --> 1:10:10.162
Beautiful.

1:10:11.250 --> 1:10:12.991
We can go tomorrow
to find the rest of it.

1:10:13.687 --> 1:10:14.688
Perhaps.

1:10:23.828 --> 1:10:25.090
I should help.

1:10:27.005 --> 1:10:30.008
Go to bed.Won'’t that waittill the morning?

1:10:30.617 --> 1:10:34.447
Father would turn in his graveif he thought I'’d gone to bedwithout cleaning his tools.

1:10:35.753 --> 1:10:36.841
Good night.

1:11:29.850 --> 1:11:31.025
[exhales]

1:11:35.726 --> 1:11:36.901
[Mary breathes heavily]

1:11:41.340 --> 1:11:43.342
[breathes heavily]

1:12:10.717 --> 1:12:12.110
[gasps]

1:12:16.810 --> 1:12:18.334
[Charlotte moans gently]

1:12:22.860 --> 1:12:24.818
[clears throat]

1:12:35.263 --> 1:12:36.395
[coughs]

1:12:39.964 --> 1:12:41.748
[door opens][man] Good morning.

1:12:41.792 --> 1:12:43.184
[bell rings]

1:12:48.146 --> 1:12:49.582
[door closes]

1:12:51.976 --> 1:12:53.543
[waves lap]

1:14:29.639 --> 1:14:32.511
[seagulls cry]

1:14:56.622 --> 1:14:57.841
[laughs]

1:15:25.477 --> 1:15:27.000
[Charlotte moans]

1:15:39.186 --> 1:15:41.058
[Charlotte] Say it again.[Mary] Hmm.

1:15:41.580 --> 1:15:42.625
Please.

1:15:46.454 --> 1:15:49.370
There was a young woman
named Sally

1:15:49.414 --> 1:15:51.547
Who loved
the occasional dally

1:15:52.286 --> 1:15:55.681
She sat on the lap
Of a well-endowed chap

1:15:55.725 --> 1:15:58.510
And she said, "Ooh,
you'’re right up my alley."

1:15:58.554 --> 1:16:00.120
[chuckles]

1:16:47.124 --> 1:16:49.387
[piano music playing]

1:17:33.910 --> 1:17:35.955
[music stops]

1:18:08.771 --> 1:18:12.426
[Mary] It was somethinglike a sea lizard with fins.

1:18:12.470 --> 1:18:15.952
It was probably six feet long.[man] Goodness.

1:18:15.995 --> 1:18:18.998
[Mary] It'’s one of the bestI'’ve found in a long time.

1:18:19.042 --> 1:18:20.826
[man] It will
require some thought.

1:18:20.870 --> 1:18:22.610
£22?

1:18:22.654 --> 1:18:24.308
What price would you
suggest then, sir?

1:18:24.351 --> 1:18:26.092
I'’m not in the market
for haggling.

1:18:28.355 --> 1:18:30.357
It'’s a stunning example,isn'’t it?

1:18:30.401 --> 1:18:34.231
In my humble opinion,the physical effortMiss Anning goes through

1:18:34.274 --> 1:18:39.323
to procure such a specimenwould make the price tag seemquite reasonable.

1:18:40.324 --> 1:18:43.370
Then there isthe painstaking hours spentworking on the specimen

1:18:43.414 --> 1:18:45.633
to reveal it
in all its beauty.

1:18:45.677 --> 1:18:48.549
Charlotte--On top of this sheer hard work,

1:18:48.593 --> 1:18:51.770
let us not forget
the knowledge
and years of skill

1:18:51.814 --> 1:18:53.467
Miss Anning brings
to her tasks.

1:18:54.251 --> 1:18:56.775
Without this,and to the untrainedor ill-formed eye,

1:18:56.819 --> 1:19:00.866
these would simply beun-investigated lumpsof stone and rock.

1:19:00.910 --> 1:19:02.650
Why do you think
the scientific community

1:19:02.694 --> 1:19:04.217
places such importance
on this work?

1:19:04.957 --> 1:19:08.918
Miss Anning informs usnot only of our past,but of our present.

1:19:08.961 --> 1:19:11.964
With all this in mind,
how would you put
a price on this, sir?

1:19:14.532 --> 1:19:15.620
I see.

1:19:46.303 --> 1:19:48.305
[Molly coughing]

1:19:55.486 --> 1:19:56.704
[sniffs]

1:20:17.595 --> 1:20:20.293
Sit down, Mrs. Anning.It'’s mushrooms for supper.

1:20:20.337 --> 1:20:21.555
Fancy.

1:20:22.252 --> 1:20:23.557
Sit down. There'’s plenty.

1:20:24.645 --> 1:20:26.822
The shop won'’t run itself.

1:20:26.865 --> 1:20:28.214
Close it, then.

1:20:29.912 --> 1:20:31.391
Oh, I almost forgot.

1:20:31.914 --> 1:20:34.830
Correspondence came for you,Mrs. Murchison.

1:21:38.415 --> 1:21:39.851
[sighs]

1:22:08.880 --> 1:22:10.099
Thank you.

1:23:06.633 --> 1:23:08.026
[door closes]

1:25:20.854 --> 1:25:22.204
Shh.

1:25:35.652 --> 1:25:36.957
[exhales]

1:25:59.110 --> 1:26:00.894
[moans softly]

1:26:09.425 --> 1:26:10.687
[exhales deeply]

1:26:10.730 --> 1:26:13.255
[breathes heavily]

1:26:53.599 --> 1:26:55.819
[moans]

1:27:00.650 --> 1:27:02.086
[breathes heavily]

1:27:12.009 --> 1:27:13.967

1:27:50.134 --> 1:27:51.657
[horse snorts]

1:28:00.884 --> 1:28:01.972
[Mary] It'’s warm.

1:28:04.844 --> 1:28:07.717
Last year at this time
we had snow,
and now it'’s nice.

1:28:16.769 --> 1:28:18.118
[horse snorts]

1:30:24.201 --> 1:30:25.637
[door closes]

1:30:30.120 --> 1:30:32.470
I had to start
the babies on my own.

1:30:39.608 --> 1:30:41.740
I think I might go to my bed.

1:30:54.623 --> 1:30:56.189
[door opens]

1:30:59.366 --> 1:31:00.629
[door closes]

1:31:26.785 --> 1:31:28.221
[door opens]

1:31:29.962 --> 1:31:31.007
What are you doing?

1:31:31.660 --> 1:31:33.444
Pricing up this thing.

1:32:19.621 --> 1:32:22.014
-[loud crash]
-[Molly whimpers]

1:32:25.583 --> 1:32:27.629
[Molly breathes heavily]

1:32:48.650 --> 1:32:49.999
[Mary grunts]

1:33:44.227 --> 1:33:45.576
[sighs]

1:34:18.087 --> 1:34:19.566
[bell rings]

1:34:19.610 --> 1:34:20.959
We'’re closed.

1:34:21.917 --> 1:34:24.484
[Elizabeth] It'’s me, Mary.Can I come in?

1:34:27.574 --> 1:34:29.054
[tea pours]

1:34:37.062 --> 1:34:38.585
I'’m so sorry, Mary.

1:34:42.720 --> 1:34:44.461
Molly was...

1:34:45.810 --> 1:34:47.638
a perspicacious woman.

1:34:48.813 --> 1:34:51.903
Her strength to carry on
after your father died
was admirable.

1:34:59.084 --> 1:35:01.304
Tell me, have you been
in correspondence

1:35:01.347 --> 1:35:03.132
with your Mrs. Murchison
recently?

1:35:05.787 --> 1:35:06.962
She'’s clever.

1:35:09.138 --> 1:35:10.574
And funny.

1:35:11.531 --> 1:35:13.577
I very much
enjoyed her company.

1:35:14.578 --> 1:35:17.320
It pleases me you'’ve struck upa friendship together.

1:35:29.767 --> 1:35:33.684
I know I hurt you terribly,and I'’m deeply sorry for that.

1:35:36.034 --> 1:35:37.383
[sighs softly]

1:35:42.432 --> 1:35:44.173
I just wasn'’t sure
I could live up to you.

1:35:46.044 --> 1:35:48.830
Or your expectations of me.

1:35:51.876 --> 1:35:54.836
A small side step
could curtail it completely.

1:35:55.924 --> 1:35:58.883
I wasn'’t the enemy,but it often felt like I was.

1:36:02.626 --> 1:36:03.670
I tried.

1:36:04.759 --> 1:36:05.890
No.

1:36:09.285 --> 1:36:10.503
I don'’t think you did.

1:36:12.679 --> 1:36:13.724
Not really.

1:36:17.554 --> 1:36:20.470
You seemed to do everything
you could to be distant.

1:36:30.610 --> 1:36:32.090
Eventually, I just...

1:36:36.573 --> 1:36:37.661
stopped trying.

1:36:43.362 --> 1:36:47.192
It seems your Mrs. Murchison
has been able to...

1:36:48.367 --> 1:36:50.500
unlock something in you
that I couldn'’t.

1:37:39.114 --> 1:37:41.377
[door rattling]

I'’m here as a guestof Mrs. Charlotte Murchison.

1:42:17.696 --> 1:42:18.741
Miss Anning?

1:42:19.307 --> 1:42:20.351
Yes.

1:42:21.309 --> 1:42:24.094
I beg your pardon, miss.Please, do come this way.

1:42:37.673 --> 1:42:39.065
Please wait here, miss.

1:43:00.261 --> 1:43:01.392
Thank you.

[chuckles]

1:44:22.560 --> 1:44:24.258
[Charlotte]That'’s just the maid.

1:44:24.736 --> 1:44:26.695
Thank you, Anne.
That will be all.

1:44:31.221 --> 1:44:33.615
[door closes]Oh, Mary! My Mary!

1:44:33.658 --> 1:44:36.444
I can'’t believe you're here.How was the journey?

1:44:36.487 --> 1:44:38.359
I wish you would have let mesend a carriage.

1:44:38.402 --> 1:44:41.492
[sighs] It feels
a very long way from Lyme.

1:44:41.536 --> 1:44:42.885
[chuckles]

1:44:48.064 --> 1:44:50.675
Oh. I had it all planned out.

1:44:50.719 --> 1:44:52.547
We'’d have tea,and then I'’d show you,

1:44:52.590 --> 1:44:55.376
but I just don'’t thinkI can wait any longer.Come on!

1:45:07.213 --> 1:45:10.347
Close your eyes.You must close your eyesor it will ruin everything.

1:45:10.391 --> 1:45:12.828
I don'’t think
I like surprises.[chuckles]

1:45:21.924 --> 1:45:23.186
You can open them.

1:45:27.712 --> 1:45:28.757
It'’s yours.

1:45:31.977 --> 1:45:33.370
Mine?Yes.

1:45:35.546 --> 1:45:36.765
To stay the night?

1:45:37.418 --> 1:45:39.768
Well, yes, but no.

1:45:40.508 --> 1:45:42.205
Also yours to move into.

1:45:42.727 --> 1:45:45.600
To live here with me.[chuckles]

1:45:46.818 --> 1:45:49.734
Here, I thought you could putyour mother'’s figurines.

1:45:50.474 --> 1:45:53.434
And here you can write
your journal.

1:45:54.870 --> 1:45:56.350
Such a good light, isn'’t it?

1:45:56.393 --> 1:45:58.482
-But I have my home.
-And in here...

1:46:03.661 --> 1:46:06.664
They'’re for you.I had them made just for you.

1:46:07.230 --> 1:46:08.318
Feel this one.

1:46:16.718 --> 1:46:18.328
Oh, and one last thing.

1:46:25.117 --> 1:46:28.338
My room.
So we'’ll be next
to each other, always.

1:46:30.340 --> 1:46:31.385
[chuckles]

1:46:37.216 --> 1:46:40.524
You'’ve thought
of everything.I hope so.

1:46:40.568 --> 1:46:42.787
I didn'’t want youto worry about anything.

1:47:01.240 --> 1:47:02.459
Well, say something.

1:47:12.513 --> 1:47:14.428
-Sorry. I really shouldn'’t---Mary.

1:47:15.690 --> 1:47:19.345
I wanted to see my relicin the British Museum today,so I should--

1:47:19.389 --> 1:47:21.478
We'’ll see it later
once we'’ve settled you in.

1:47:27.049 --> 1:47:30.226
I feel...
I feel I'’m at
a great disadvantage.

1:47:31.706 --> 1:47:32.750
Pardon?

1:47:35.231 --> 1:47:36.667
I feel I'’ve been misled.

1:47:38.364 --> 1:47:41.629
I don'’t think I have...I was invited for a visit.

1:47:43.152 --> 1:47:45.197
And now it seems
I'’ve been hoodwinked
in some way.

1:47:45.241 --> 1:47:46.460
Mary...

1:47:48.636 --> 1:47:50.551
Why did you not mentionall this in your letter?

1:47:52.944 --> 1:47:54.946
I wanted to see
the look on your face.

1:47:54.990 --> 1:47:56.948
You presumed I'’d be fittedinto your life, here,

1:47:56.992 --> 1:47:59.168
like one of my relicsin your fine glass case.

1:47:59.211 --> 1:48:01.126
No, of course not.Will you label me, too?

1:48:01.170 --> 1:48:05.479
No, that'’s not what I want.
That'’s not what I intended.

1:48:05.957 --> 1:48:07.785
I want this to be different.

1:48:07.829 --> 1:48:09.004
Our different.

1:48:09.700 --> 1:48:11.354
This must make
your husband very happy.

1:48:11.397 --> 1:48:13.791
-Who cares?
-Oh, please don'’t
make fun of me.

1:48:13.835 --> 1:48:16.577
Roddy is content with his life.Very content.

1:48:16.620 --> 1:48:20.972
And because of you, he now
has a proper interest that
takes up most of his time.

1:48:21.016 --> 1:48:24.019
You make it sound so neat,like I planned it.

1:48:24.062 --> 1:48:25.716
Of course not.

1:48:26.543 --> 1:48:29.285
Please,
why are you doing this?

1:48:29.894 --> 1:48:32.636
I don'’t want to go backto the life I had before you.

1:48:33.376 --> 1:48:36.335
What about my life, Charlotte?My work?

1:48:37.032 --> 1:48:40.862
I can'’t bear to thinkof you suffering out on thosebeaches in all weathers.

1:48:40.905 --> 1:48:43.995
And now you'’ll be free
to do your important work,

1:48:44.039 --> 1:48:46.171
your scientific work.

1:48:48.391 --> 1:48:49.566
You don'’t understand me.

1:48:58.836 --> 1:49:00.055
No!

1:49:03.580 --> 1:49:06.931
Your proposition makes me
feel like some fancy bird
in a gilded cage.

1:49:08.890 --> 1:49:10.326
[sighs]

1:49:10.369 --> 1:49:12.371
I need to find lodgingsfor tonight.

1:49:15.853 --> 1:49:17.333
I wish you'’d told me before.

1:49:19.422 --> 1:49:21.250
I could have saved
the boat fare.

1:49:21.293 --> 1:49:23.469
Mary... Mary!

1:49:31.477 --> 1:49:35.743
[chattering and laughter
in the distance]

1:49:59.897 --> 1:50:03.074
[horses'’ hooves clatter]
