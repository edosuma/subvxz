any more than I am.

And for the record,
I'm not the Green Arrow.

04:49.873 --> 04:51.330
There appears to be
a fair amount of evidence

04:51.416 --> 04:53.123
to suggest the former mayor is guilty.

What evidence?

That photo from several months ago?
That was doctored.

who they're going to find

04:57.881 --> 04:59.588
to say Oliver's the Green Arrow,
but they'll be lying.

04:59.674 --> 05:01.711
- You sound pretty sure of that.
- I am.

six years ago, remember?

05:05.430 --> 05:06.887

get some B-roll.

who the Green Arrow is.

06:41.401 --> 06:42.482

06:48.575 --> 06:50.407
Oliver Queen is a hero.

06:51.411 --> 06:52.401
He is.

06:52.662 --> 06:55.200
He's saved this city more times
than anybody can count.

06:57.125 --> 06:59.412
But he's done it all from behind a mask,

06:59.711 --> 07:02.579
so that he could take the law
into his own hands.

07:04.215 --> 07:07.333
In fact, he's taken as many lives
as he's saved.

07:07.761 --> 07:10.344
So, yes, Oliver Queen is a hero,

07:11.097 --> 07:13.259
but that doesn't mean
he's not also a criminal.

07:17.979 --> 07:21.347
JEAN: Three weeks ago,
Oliver Queen was mayor of this city.

07:22.442 --> 07:25.651
In that time, he has gone
from being under indictment,

07:26.196 --> 07:28.688
to impeachment, to being on trial.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.281
How?

07:31.368 --> 07:33.781
How could everything go wrong
so quickly for him?

07:34.287 --> 07:36.199
I think intuitively you know the answer.

07:36.623 --> 07:37.613
Corruption.

It runs through this city like a cancer,

07:40.293 --> 07:45.129

while discrediting others, like...

07:46.091 --> 07:47.423
Like the defendant.

07:47.592 --> 07:50.551
Even the anti-vigilante law
that he is being charged under

07:50.804 --> 07:53.046
is the work of the corrupt men and women

07:53.139 --> 07:55.631
who are holding our city in their grip.

07:56.059 --> 07:58.142
This may sound like a conspiracy theory,

07:58.228 --> 08:00.470
but at the conclusion of this trial,

08:00.563 --> 08:03.522
I'm going to ask you
what is most likely.

08:03.942 --> 08:06.605
That our city's government
has been compromised,

08:07.070 --> 08:10.529
or that we elected a superhero
as our mayor?

08:13.159 --> 08:15.742
Ms. Van Owen,
please call your first witness.

08:16.579 --> 08:17.865
The people call John Diggle.

08:22.669 --> 08:23.659

08:25.005 --> 08:27.497

for Mr. Diggle.

within one hour,

08:29.718 --> 08:31.801
he'll be held in contempt of this court.

08:34.389 --> 08:35.379

08:49.404 --> 08:51.862
- Yes.
- For various suspicious injuries,

08:51.948 --> 08:52.938
is that correct?

08:53.033 --> 08:56.447
I can't say without violating
doctor-patient confidentiality.

08:56.619 --> 08:57.609
I understand.

08:57.704 --> 09:00.538
Then let me direct your attention,
please, to an incident

09:00.999 --> 09:02.865
when Mr. Queen was not a patient.

On the night of April 6th, 2016,

09:05.545 --> 09:07.537
the Green Arrow
brought in the Black Canary.

09:08.006 --> 09:10.544
And according to your records,
she had been stabbed...

09:10.675 --> 09:13.042
Objection. Is there a question
in our future?

09:13.470 --> 09:14.460
Yes.

09:15.305 --> 09:17.467
That night, you were close enough
to the Green Arrow

09:17.557 --> 09:19.048
to determine his identity.

09:19.893 --> 09:23.227
So my question is whose face
did you see that night?

09:23.438 --> 09:26.021
I was focused
on saving Ms. Lance's life.

09:26.274 --> 09:29.233
I wasn't the least bit concerned
with who the Green Arrow was.

09:29.611 --> 09:30.852
<i>Concerned or not,</i>

09:31.571 --> 09:33.733
<i>whose face did you see
underneath that mask?</i>

09:33.823 --> 09:36.236
You know, it's not bad.
Oliver might just pull this one off.

09:36.493 --> 09:37.904
You want to put money on that?

09:39.162 --> 09:41.199
Diaz wants Oliver in prison.

09:42.123 --> 09:44.160
You'd think he'd want to kill him.
I mean, at least try.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.784
What, so the Green Arrow
can become a martyr?

09:47.253 --> 09:48.494
- Diaz is smarter than that.
- (CELL PHONE RINGING)

09:50.298 --> 09:51.334

09:53.134 --> 09:54.466
Something like that.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.005
You know, you don't have to go.

09:57.305 --> 09:59.922
First step to standing up to him
is to stand up to him.

10:00.058 --> 10:02.550
Sounds like the first step
to getting myself killed.

10:02.685 --> 10:05.473
Not for nothing,
but apart from your face,

10:06.397 --> 10:08.639
there's one thing
you got in common with my Laurel.

10:08.942 --> 10:09.932
And what's that?

10:10.527 --> 10:13.110
Neither of you would let
somebody else tell you what to do

10:13.196 --> 10:14.277
or have you running scared.

10:14.364 --> 10:17.072
You think your Laurel
would stand up to Diaz?

10:17.158 --> 10:18.148
I know it.

10:18.576 --> 10:21.034
Well, maybe if she were a little smarter

10:21.579 --> 10:23.286
she wouldn't have gotten herself killed.

10:29.003 --> 10:30.244
It's been one hour.

10:39.889 --> 10:41.005
Out of town.

10:43.101 --> 10:45.138
Oliver Queen is not the Green Arrow.

10:46.563 --> 10:48.054
I can't make it any plainer than that.

10:48.314 --> 10:49.771
How can you be so sure?

10:49.941 --> 10:53.150
From 2012 to 2016,
I was his personal bodyguard.

10:54.112 --> 10:56.149
If he was running around
with a bow and arrow,

10:56.823 --> 10:57.813
I would have known it.

10:57.991 --> 11:00.028
- But would you admit knowing it?
- Why wouldn't I?

11:00.285 --> 11:02.493
Because you were aiding
and abetting a vigilante?

11:02.662 --> 11:03.698
I absolutely was not.

11:04.372 --> 11:06.659
In fact, I had very limited
interaction with Oliver Queen.

11:06.916 --> 11:07.906
How can that be?

11:08.001 --> 11:09.993
You were head of his security
at City Hall.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.627
And my job was to keep him safe.

11:12.297 --> 11:15.165
And that included
not jumping off of rooftops.

11:15.258 --> 11:17.500
Mr. Diggle, you can't even keep
yourself safe.

11:17.927 --> 11:21.295
I mean, in the past four years
you've been abducted by Damien Darhk.

11:21.389 --> 11:23.176
Your own child was also kidnapped.

11:23.474 --> 11:25.682
You were hospitalized for nerve damage

11:25.768 --> 11:28.010
caused by severe trauma.

11:28.646 --> 11:29.636
Mr. Diggle,

11:30.481 --> 11:33.849
either you travel in some
very dangerous circles,

11:35.361 --> 11:36.818
or you have the worst luck ever.

11:38.907 --> 11:40.023
Who was Sean Sonus?

11:40.158 --> 11:41.740
- JEAN: Objection. Relevance?
- Overruled.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.367
- Your Honor...
- I said overruled.

11:44.662 --> 11:45.652
Answer the question.

11:46.956 --> 11:48.572
He was a drug dealer I investigated

11:48.666 --> 11:50.749
while undercover in the
Central City Police Department.

11:50.919 --> 11:53.332
And he was shot and killed
in Hub City last year.

11:53.463 --> 11:56.206
Your Honor, I renew my objection
as to relevance.

11:56.299 --> 11:58.006
Well, if Ms. Drake is a murderer,

11:58.092 --> 12:00.584
it would certainly undermine
her credibility now, wouldn't it?

12:01.512 --> 12:02.593
JUDGE: Objection overruled.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.298
Again. Sit down, Ms. Loring.

12:05.934 --> 12:09.223
So, you were not with
the Central City Police Department

12:09.312 --> 12:11.099
when Mr. Sonus was killed.
Is that correct?

12:11.397 --> 12:12.933
- That's right.
- Did you murder him?

12:13.399 --> 12:15.561
- Your Honor!
- Answer the question.

12:22.450 --> 12:24.191
I'm exercising my Fifth Amendment right

12:24.285 --> 12:25.571
against self-incrimination.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.156
(CROWD MURMURING)

12:38.007 --> 12:38.997
You beckoned?

12:40.468 --> 12:42.209
I saw something interesting on TV.

12:43.888 --> 12:46.096
<i>And I'll testify to it
if they subpoena me.</i>

12:48.309 --> 12:49.390
Is there a problem?

12:50.812 --> 12:51.802
Not yet, there isn't.

12:53.356 --> 12:55.018
You know, this would move a lot faster

12:55.108 --> 12:56.724
if you would stop talking in circles.

12:57.360 --> 12:59.852
You were given
the gift-wrapped opportunity

13:00.738 --> 13:02.400
to say that Oliver Queen

13:02.907 --> 13:03.897
was the Green Arrow.

13:06.995 --> 13:07.985
You didn't do it, baby.

13:08.288 --> 13:09.745
I wasn't aware I was supposed to.

13:10.290 --> 13:13.704
Well, that's why we're here,
having this little meeting.

13:14.460 --> 13:16.452
So we can set expectations.

13:17.297 --> 13:20.586
The prosecution is holding you
as a rebuttal witness,

13:20.925 --> 13:22.541
so when they call you,

13:22.802 --> 13:25.010
you're gonna be the final nail
in the coffin.

13:25.471 --> 13:27.758
If I go in and try
and convince a courtroom

13:27.849 --> 13:29.056
that I'm Laurel Lance,

13:29.976 --> 13:31.092
I'm gonna get made.

13:32.895 --> 13:34.306
Maybe you're right.

13:36.524 --> 13:38.231
You don't have a poker face.

13:41.696 --> 13:42.686
For example...

13:44.532 --> 13:46.194
The way you've been acting lately,

13:48.077 --> 13:50.569
ever since I torched Federico
on that rooftop...

13:53.416 --> 13:55.408
You've been keeping
your distance from me.

13:56.252 --> 13:58.118
I don't know what you're talking about.

13:59.672 --> 14:00.662
It's okay.

14:02.925 --> 14:03.915
You're okay.

14:06.637 --> 14:07.969
I just want to be a little clear.

14:09.432 --> 14:10.548
(CHOKING)

14:12.518 --> 14:14.009
When you take the stand,

14:15.480 --> 14:18.894
I want you to give the jury
a much better performance

14:19.859 --> 14:21.066
than the one you're giving me.

14:23.488 --> 14:24.945
You know what I'm talking about now?

14:26.449 --> 14:27.439
Good.

14:28.576 --> 14:29.908
That's a good girl.

14:31.954 --> 14:33.445
(GASPING)

14:37.001 --> 14:38.287
Gotta go to the courthouse.

14:46.344 --> 14:48.336
It's not going too good, is it?

14:48.554 --> 14:49.965
Hey, no, it's going fine.

14:50.056 --> 14:51.513
It's fine. That was just
the prosecution's turn,

14:51.599 --> 14:54.262
so when it's our turn,
we're gonna kick some major ass.

14:55.436 --> 14:56.597
That's a legal term.

14:58.856 --> 15:00.563
Why don't you go
and get yourself something

15:00.650 --> 15:02.482
that's not too unhealthy
from the vending machine, okay?

15:02.777 --> 15:03.767
Okay.

15:08.324 --> 15:10.486
What will happen
if Mr. Oliver goes to jail?

15:10.576 --> 15:12.112
He's not going to jail, Raisa.

15:12.495 --> 15:13.736
He's not the Green Arrow.

15:15.456 --> 15:17.038
I think we both know better.

15:22.630 --> 15:25.543
I tanked it. I did exactly
what you said not to do.

15:25.633 --> 15:27.169
Lawyer's good, D.

15:27.552 --> 15:29.009
Don't worry, I'll bring it home.

15:29.095 --> 15:31.428
How? We got immunity
from the prosecution.

15:31.514 --> 15:33.426
If watching every episode
of <i>Law & Order</i> ever

15:33.516 --> 15:35.849
has taught me anything,
it's that you can't plead the Fifth.

15:36.352 --> 15:38.594
If you get cornered
and you refuse to testify,

15:38.688 --> 15:41.021
- you go to jail, Rene.
- Well, then I'll go to jail, hoss.

15:41.566 --> 15:43.523
But I'm not screwing Oliver over again.

15:44.444 --> 15:47.232
Hey, guys, the clerk just called
the court back into session.

15:51.993 --> 15:54.235
I worked in the Mayor's office
close to a year.

15:55.246 --> 15:58.034
Side-by-side with Mr. Queen
every single day.

16:00.001 --> 16:02.789
If he was running around
pretending to be Robin Hood,

16:03.337 --> 16:05.044
- I would have known.
- And did you know it?

16:11.220 --> 16:12.210
Mr. Ramirez...

16:15.683 --> 16:16.844
Mr. Ramirez...

16:17.351 --> 16:19.684
Did you have occasion to determine

16:19.937 --> 16:22.520
whether Oliver Queen
was the Green Arrow?

16:27.820 --> 16:28.810
OLIVER: Rene...

16:39.582 --> 16:40.572
He's the Green Arrow.

16:41.375 --> 16:42.365
Oliver is.

16:42.877 --> 16:44.584
VAN OWEN: And you know this
because you were a member

16:44.670 --> 16:46.627
of his vigilante team, weren't you?

16:47.965 --> 16:48.955
Yeah.

16:50.843 --> 16:55.258
Did you ever see the defendant kill
or maim anyone as the Green Arrow?

16:56.390 --> 16:57.380
Yeah.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.258
How many people did he kill or maim?

17:04.065 --> 17:06.021
- I don't know.
- Ballpark it for me.

17:06.108 --> 17:07.144
I don't know!

17:10.988 --> 17:12.273
It's too many to count.

17:12.365 --> 17:14.357
- (CROWD MURMURING LOUDLY)
- JUDGE: Order.

17:14.534 --> 17:15.523
Order!

17:16.035 --> 17:17.867
VAN OWEN:
The prosecution rests, Your Honor.

17:32.552 --> 17:33.793
Are you okay?

17:33.886 --> 17:35.548
- Are you hurt?
- I'm fine.

17:35.846 --> 17:37.007
He picked me up from school.

17:37.348 --> 17:38.680
He was with a police officer.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.048
They said you were hurt.

17:42.186 --> 17:43.722
He was here and we just let him walk?

17:44.105 --> 17:45.266
We're not letting him walk.

17:45.940 --> 17:47.021
Let's get outta here.

17:57.535 --> 17:59.902
Hey, look at you.

18:00.288 --> 18:02.746
Maybe you don't care about people
finding out the truth about you.

18:02.999 --> 18:04.740
That's right. I don't care.

18:04.959 --> 18:06.416
Whatever it takes to stop you.

18:06.752 --> 18:09.119
How about taking on
the entire police force?

18:10.089 --> 18:11.580
How does that sound to you?

18:13.217 --> 18:14.378
You want us to light them up, boss?

18:15.011 --> 18:16.297
That depends on them.

18:17.888 --> 18:18.969
My man.

18:19.098 --> 18:20.384
What do you want us to do with them?

18:21.350 --> 18:22.557
Nothing.

18:23.352 --> 18:25.435
If they had an accident
after testifying...

18:26.522 --> 18:27.512
Could be awkward.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.974
Hey, smile.

18:31.861 --> 18:33.648
It's your lucky day, baby.

18:39.910 --> 18:40.900
Okay.

18:40.995 --> 18:42.657
Is this as bad as it looks?

18:42.788 --> 18:44.199
Arguably worse.

18:45.791 --> 18:49.956
Can we prove that Diaz
was putting pressure on Rene?

18:50.046 --> 18:52.254
No, no, no. I mean,
even assuming we could,

18:52.757 --> 18:55.295
the jury has no idea
who Ricardo Diaz is.

18:56.344 --> 19:00.258
Conventional wisdom says you never
ask a client if they are guilty,

19:00.348 --> 19:04.058
because the more I know,
the more it might tie my hands but...

19:04.727 --> 19:06.013
I am gonna ask...

19:08.439 --> 19:09.805
Are you the Green Arrow?

19:11.734 --> 19:12.724
Yes.

19:18.824 --> 19:20.690
Then I'm going to propose
a new strategy.

19:20.785 --> 19:22.401
- Okay.
- Jury nullification.

19:22.536 --> 19:23.902
- Hmm?
- You're going to admit

19:23.996 --> 19:25.282
to being the Green Arrow.

19:25.706 --> 19:28.744
We are then going to highlight
every single thing you have done

19:28.834 --> 19:31.076
for this city,
all the times you have saved it.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.708
We will argue you do not deserve
to go to prison.

19:34.048 --> 19:36.916
This is a legitimate chance, Oliver.

19:37.802 --> 19:39.509
- I can't do it.
- Why not?

19:40.429 --> 19:42.546
I'd be putting a target on my back.

19:43.140 --> 19:46.975
I'd be putting a target
on my wife and son's back.

19:48.813 --> 19:51.180
I have been the Green Arrow
for six years.

19:51.440 --> 19:54.023
I didn't plan on doing it forever.

19:54.110 --> 19:56.568
I thought that one day
my mission would end,

19:56.654 --> 19:59.567
and I would finally,
after all this time,

19:59.740 --> 20:02.574
get a chance to actually live my life.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.570
That will never happen,

20:08.624 --> 20:10.741
if I tell the whole world

20:11.627 --> 20:13.118
that I'm the Green Arrow.

20:23.180 --> 20:24.671
You don't have to testify.

20:24.765 --> 20:27.052
- Jean doesn't have to call you.
- Yes, she does.

20:27.143 --> 20:28.350
And I want to testify.

20:28.477 --> 20:30.810
I don't want you in a position
where you perjure yourself

20:30.896 --> 20:31.886
because of me.

20:32.148 --> 20:33.855
Well, let me just add it
to the long list of felonies

20:33.941 --> 20:34.931
I've already committed for you.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.649
Look, John has something planned.

20:38.696 --> 20:40.358
You don't have to take the chance.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.026
I will take any chance,

20:42.450 --> 20:45.318
if it keeps you from being taken away
from me and William.

20:45.453 --> 20:46.819
BAILIFF: Court is back in session.

20:47.413 --> 20:48.403
Here we go.

20:54.712 --> 20:58.376
I graduated summa cum laude from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology

20:58.466 --> 21:00.753
with master's degrees in cybersecurity

21:00.843 --> 21:01.924
and computer sciences.

21:02.011 --> 21:06.176
From 2015 to 2016, I served as
the CEO of Palmer Tech Incorporated.

21:07.057 --> 21:08.093
JEAN: Thank you.

21:08.517 --> 21:11.430
Defense moves to have Ms. Smoak
accepted as an expert witness.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.140
I don't see the point of this,
Ms. Loring.

21:13.230 --> 21:16.098
I want the witness to testify
to the validity of this photograph.

21:16.275 --> 21:17.982
Fine, but make it quick.

21:19.403 --> 21:20.519
Ms. Smoak,

21:20.946 --> 21:24.485
this appears to be a photograph
of your husband, Oliver Queen,

21:24.950 --> 21:27.158
- dressed as the Green Arrow.
- Yes.

21:27.244 --> 21:30.863
The key words being "appears to be."
This photo has been doctored.

21:30.998 --> 21:34.787
A pixel level analysis will show
almost undetectable light shifts

21:34.877 --> 21:36.664
and resolution inconsistencies

21:36.962 --> 21:38.874
that would not be present
in a natural photo.

21:39.048 --> 21:40.038
VAN OWEN:
Objection, Your Honor.

21:40.132 --> 21:43.341
What is the point of showing us an
allegedly doctored photograph at all?

21:43.511 --> 21:44.922
The better question would be,

21:45.012 --> 21:47.254
who and why would they doctor a photo

21:47.348 --> 21:48.964
to make Oliver Queen
look like the Green Arrow

21:49.058 --> 21:50.094
if he were the Green Arrow?

21:51.685 --> 21:53.642
I mean, which he's not.
He's my husband, I would know.

21:54.438 --> 21:55.599
JEAN: No further questions.

21:57.817 --> 21:59.149
When was Mr. Queen arrested?

21:59.401 --> 22:01.142
November 21st, 2017.

22:01.278 --> 22:02.689
And when were the two of you married?

22:02.822 --> 22:05.064
- November 28th.
- Just a week later?

22:05.199 --> 22:06.189
Yes.

22:06.367 --> 22:07.733
Is it possible that you
rushed the wedding

22:07.827 --> 22:09.864
so that you could claim
spousal privilege,

22:10.079 --> 22:12.571
just in case you had to testify
against Mr. Queen?

22:12.832 --> 22:15.745
I've been in love with Oliver
for six years.

22:16.210 --> 22:17.701
Trust me, it felt anything but rushed.

22:18.045 --> 22:19.377
VAN OWEN:
Let's change the topic.

22:19.630 --> 22:21.667
Your father's Noah Kuttler,
the alleged Calculator...

22:21.757 --> 22:23.339
- Objection.
- Overruled.

22:23.843 --> 22:26.085
- He's reformed.
- VAN OWEN: But before he was,

22:26.303 --> 22:29.796
did you know that he was a notorious
computer hacker and cybercriminal?

22:29.890 --> 22:30.880
No, I had no idea.

22:31.100 --> 22:32.511
Doesn't say much about your ability

22:32.601 --> 22:34.843
to see criminality in people
close to you, does it?

22:35.229 --> 22:36.720
- I would...
- And under the heading,

22:36.814 --> 22:38.601
"Apples falling from trees,"

22:38.691 --> 22:41.434
have you yourself ever engaged
in cybercrime?

22:41.527 --> 22:43.314
No, I haven't.

22:44.655 --> 22:46.362
Good luck proving otherwise,
Ms. Van Owen.

22:48.576 --> 22:50.238
Roy Harper is not a vigilante.

22:51.036 --> 22:53.244
He sacrificed himself
to protect the identity

22:53.330 --> 22:56.038
of a man that the city at the time

22:56.542 --> 22:58.078
referred to as "The Hood,"

22:58.377 --> 22:59.413
or "The Arrow."

22:59.837 --> 23:02.045
I've since come to learn
that the Green Arrow

23:02.131 --> 23:03.167
is the same person.

23:03.465 --> 23:05.923
- But that's not you.
- It's absolutely not me.

23:06.302 --> 23:07.884
And do you know who it is?

23:08.012 --> 23:11.505
Yes, I do,
but I will not reveal his identity.

23:13.475 --> 23:15.137
Not even if it sends me to prison.

23:16.937 --> 23:17.927
Pass the witness.

23:18.439 --> 23:19.680
Well, that's convenient.

23:20.524 --> 23:21.765
You're not the Green Arrow,

23:21.859 --> 23:24.067
you know who is the Green Arrow,
but you're not saying.

23:24.278 --> 23:25.940
Well, I keep my promises, Ms. Van Owen.

23:26.113 --> 23:27.649
When did you meet this mystery man?

23:27.865 --> 23:29.481
Shortly after I returned to Star City.

23:30.284 --> 23:32.651
As you know, I was marooned
for five years on an island

23:32.745 --> 23:33.735
named Lian Yu.

23:33.996 --> 23:36.363
This photograph was taken
during that five-year period.

23:36.457 --> 23:39.370
I'm just curious, why does Lian Yu
look a lot like Russia?

23:39.543 --> 23:41.159
- Objection.
- JUDGE: Overruled.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.082
VAN OWEN: We obtained this photograph
from a reporter

23:43.172 --> 23:44.959
by the name of Susan Williams.

23:47.676 --> 23:52.296
I've not been entirely forthcoming
about that period of time in my life.

23:53.974 --> 23:56.011
Parts of it were spent in Hong Kong,

23:57.686 --> 23:59.552
and, yes, parts of it
were spent in Russia.

24:00.230 --> 24:01.471
So, you lied,

24:01.941 --> 24:04.558
repeatedly and publicly?

24:05.444 --> 24:07.686
You lied about being on Lian Yu,

24:07.780 --> 24:09.988
and you lied about
five years of your life,

24:10.074 --> 24:12.441
which begs the question, Mr. Queen...

24:13.452 --> 24:15.159
What else have you lied about?

24:36.350 --> 24:37.386
Quiet.

24:37.476 --> 24:39.183
Quiet or I'll clear the courtroom.

24:39.269 --> 24:40.430
(GAVEL BANGING)

24:40.646 --> 24:42.387
Please state your name for the record.

24:42.815 --> 24:44.147
Thomas Merlyn.

24:44.650 --> 24:45.982
"Tommy" is fine if you want.

24:46.276 --> 24:48.359
Mr. Merlyn, you were declared dead,

24:48.570 --> 24:50.562
May 15, 2013.

24:50.823 --> 24:53.736
That night, my father destroyed
a large portion of the city.

24:54.618 --> 24:56.280
With the heightened scrutiny
on my family,

24:56.370 --> 24:59.033
I took the opportunity
to fake my own death

24:59.248 --> 25:01.490
to protect my identity as The Hood.

25:01.667 --> 25:02.703
Three years ago,

25:03.335 --> 25:05.668
Roy Harper confessed to being The Hood.

25:06.046 --> 25:07.162
To protect me.

25:08.132 --> 25:10.340
And then he was attacked in prison.

25:12.177 --> 25:15.466
I have lived with that guilt
for three years.

25:17.391 --> 25:20.225
I am not about to let Oliver
take the blame for me

25:20.602 --> 25:22.309
the same way that Roy did.

25:23.272 --> 25:24.604
And that's why I'm here.

25:25.607 --> 25:26.723
To set the record straight.

25:27.443 --> 25:28.433
Thank you.

25:29.319 --> 25:30.309
Your witness.

25:33.282 --> 25:34.648
If you're the Green Arrow,

25:34.950 --> 25:38.364
how come Rene Ramirez testified
under oath that Oliver Queen is?

25:38.829 --> 25:42.573
Well, I would suspect
that he was being pressured to.

25:42.791 --> 25:44.327
Are you saying he perjured himself?

25:44.710 --> 25:46.246
Well, I don't know. I'm not a lawyer.

25:46.795 --> 25:48.252
I'm just the Green Arrow.

25:49.590 --> 25:51.957
And I am telling you I am the only man

25:52.342 --> 25:54.129
that has ever worn this hood.

25:54.344 --> 25:55.630
Mr. Merlyn,

25:55.804 --> 25:58.137
you're under arrest
on suspicion of murder,

25:58.223 --> 26:02.058
assault, and violation
of the Anti-Vigilante Act of 2017.

26:02.311 --> 26:04.394
The bailiff will remand
Mr. Merlyn into custody.

26:04.605 --> 26:06.562
Objection, Your Honor.
It's the People's contention

26:06.648 --> 26:09.231
that Mr. Merlyn here
is not the Green Arrow.

26:09.359 --> 26:10.349
Be that as it may,

26:10.444 --> 26:12.185
I can't just let him walk out
of my courtroom.

26:12.571 --> 26:14.107
You know, if it's any consolation,

26:14.198 --> 26:17.532
my team is going to extract me
before I ever get to prison, so...

26:18.702 --> 26:19.909
Get him out of here.

26:21.830 --> 26:23.662
Your Honor, defense moves
for a dismissal.

26:23.749 --> 26:24.785
Nice try,

26:24.875 --> 26:27.583
but it's the jury's job
to sort out this kind of mess,

26:27.669 --> 26:28.910
and that's what I'm gonna let them do.

26:38.514 --> 26:40.255
Guys, on the way to Iron Heights,

26:40.349 --> 26:41.681
do you think we could stop
at a drive-thru?

26:41.767 --> 26:44.305
- I am starving.
- We're not going to Iron Heights.

26:44.561 --> 26:46.848
Mr. Diaz really wants to meet you.

26:46.980 --> 26:49.518
All right, so where did we land
on the drive-thru? It's my treat...

26:49.733 --> 26:51.645
(LAUGHING)

26:51.735 --> 26:53.897
You know, six against one,

26:54.238 --> 26:55.570
it's not really a fair fight.

26:55.739 --> 26:57.856
You should have brought backup. I did.

27:06.917 --> 27:08.533
You're cutting a little close there,
aren't you, John?

27:11.255 --> 27:12.336
What's your exit strategy?

27:12.881 --> 27:13.962
Sitting right there.

27:16.385 --> 27:17.375
Well, let's go.

27:23.392 --> 27:25.349
- Thanks for doing this.
- My pleasure.

27:25.978 --> 27:27.719
I always wanted to say,
"I am Spartacus."

27:31.859 --> 27:34.067
- It's Christopher Chance.
- Rene Ramirez.

27:34.653 --> 27:36.861
I think I bought you
a perjury charge back there, Rene.

27:37.030 --> 27:38.737
Small price to pay
for a clear conscience.

27:39.408 --> 27:40.398
You think it worked?

27:40.659 --> 27:44.073
At the very least, we've created
some very serious reasonable doubt.

27:44.371 --> 27:45.953
Yeah, let's hope so.

27:55.382 --> 27:57.965
When you said I didn't have
to take the "chance" of lying,

27:58.051 --> 27:59.713
- that was a pun!
- I don't do puns.

27:59.928 --> 28:01.794
Well, that was Christopher Chance
I did just see in there, right?

28:01.889 --> 28:02.925
Yes.

28:03.056 --> 28:04.422
I'm sorry that I couldn't loop you in.

28:04.516 --> 28:07.259
We had Officer Parks listening
to every word that we said,

28:07.352 --> 28:08.342
and I...

28:13.483 --> 28:16.271
I didn't know Chance
was gonna use Tommy's face.

28:16.904 --> 28:19.942
Well, yeah, I mean, I guess they were
thinking what's more compelling

28:20.032 --> 28:21.489
than a testimony from a dead guy, right?

28:24.036 --> 28:25.026
Excuse me.

28:25.370 --> 28:27.362
- Mr. Mayor.
- We've got a problem.

28:27.456 --> 28:28.446
Not anymore.

28:28.999 --> 28:30.991
- Chance just saved our bacon.
- Laurel told me.

28:31.210 --> 28:33.793
She also told me
that Diaz is making her testify

28:33.879 --> 28:34.960
as a rebuttal witness.

28:35.839 --> 28:39.708
He's sending her in there
with Chance's entire CIA file.

28:39.968 --> 28:42.255
She will be telling the jury everything

28:42.346 --> 28:44.679
about what you guys
just pulled in there.

28:45.807 --> 28:47.093
Or Diaz is going to kill her.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.392
How does Diaz even know about Chance?

28:50.854 --> 28:55.019
'Cause Diaz has access to everything
that Cayden James learned from his...

28:57.736 --> 28:59.102
It's the bug in the bunker.

28:59.529 --> 29:00.610
I'm sorry, Oliver.

29:02.032 --> 29:03.022
We'll think of something.

29:03.450 --> 29:04.941
I'll give you guys some room.

29:11.041 --> 29:12.907
Okay. Okay, so...

29:15.087 --> 29:17.329
Okay, what's the something
that we're gonna think of?

29:17.464 --> 29:19.626
Jean suggested that I just admit
I'm the Green Arrow

29:19.716 --> 29:21.332
and we go for some sort of
jury nullification.

29:21.426 --> 29:23.088
But I explained to her that

29:23.178 --> 29:24.669
I would like to have a life

29:24.888 --> 29:28.131
after being the Green Arrow,
but more importantly, I...

29:28.934 --> 29:30.846
I cannot put a target
on you and William.

29:31.103 --> 29:33.265
Let me worry about me and William.

29:33.397 --> 29:35.480
Let me at least take that
off your plate.

29:37.484 --> 29:38.895
That's not how wedding vows work.

29:39.278 --> 29:40.814
We didn't exchange vows.

29:41.321 --> 29:42.607
But if we did,

29:42.781 --> 29:44.238
"exchange" means "go both ways."

29:45.492 --> 29:46.903
And we fight

29:47.327 --> 29:50.115
for each other, Oliver.
We protect each other.

29:52.541 --> 29:53.748
We're gonna save each other.

29:54.376 --> 29:56.038
I can't save anyone from behind bars.

29:56.128 --> 29:57.585
We'll get you out
just like we got John out.

29:57.838 --> 30:01.252
I can break out of prison, Felicity,
but then what, you know?

30:03.427 --> 30:05.419
I'm not abandoning the two of you.

30:05.512 --> 30:07.378
I can't make the two of you fugitives.

30:07.514 --> 30:08.721
We're gonna be okay.

30:08.849 --> 30:11.307
John and I have been talking, and...

30:11.810 --> 30:14.427
If I go to prison, I need

30:16.732 --> 30:19.270
you and William to go into
A.R.G.U.S. protective custody.

30:19.818 --> 30:20.934
(GASPS)

30:25.365 --> 30:26.481
We're not there yet.

30:28.243 --> 30:29.404
We cannot live in denial.

30:30.746 --> 30:32.203
All right, we have to have a plan.

30:35.208 --> 30:36.574
I can handle losing my freedom.

30:39.880 --> 30:41.872
I cannot handle losing you and William.

BLACK SIREN: I solemnly affirm to
tell the truth, the whole truth,

31:01.985 --> 31:03.317
and nothing but the truth.

- (EXHALES)
- VAN OWEN: Ms. Lance,

31:05.447 --> 31:07.439
the defendant here
has publicly acknowledged

31:07.657 --> 31:10.616
that you were the vigilante
known as the Black Canary.

31:11.078 --> 31:12.944
Is it fair to take Mr. Queen
at his word?

31:14.581 --> 31:15.913
On that, at least.

31:16.041 --> 31:20.035
And being that the Black Canary is
a known associate of the Green Arrow,

31:21.463 --> 31:24.046
is it fair to say
you know his true identity?

31:24.174 --> 31:25.164
I do.

31:25.675 --> 31:26.916
<i>I know who the Green Arrow is.</i>

31:27.552 --> 31:28.633
Good girl.

31:29.096 --> 31:32.885
Over the course of this trial,
we heard Rene Ramirez testify

31:33.392 --> 31:36.226
that Oliver Queen was the Green Arrow,

31:36.478 --> 31:40.518
but a man calling himself
Tommy Merlyn claims that identity.

31:41.149 --> 31:44.062
Ms. Lance, if you would,
please, just help me out here.

31:45.070 --> 31:46.186
Who's telling the truth?

31:48.490 --> 31:49.901
I got an idea, hoss.

31:50.575 --> 31:52.066
- Help me out.
- Let's go.

32:00.585 --> 32:01.575
Ms. Lance,

32:03.588 --> 32:04.920
who is the Green Arrow?

32:11.972 --> 32:12.962
Tommy Merlyn.

32:15.100 --> 32:17.467
Oliver Queen is not the Green Arrow.

32:17.727 --> 32:18.763
(GAVEL BANGING)

32:29.906 --> 32:30.987
No comment.

32:31.783 --> 32:32.899
No comment!

32:33.201 --> 32:35.113
Back up! Give her a break, please.

32:35.203 --> 32:36.193
Hey, hey, listen to me.

32:37.456 --> 32:39.664
- Are you okay?
- Until Diaz gets a hold of me, yeah.

32:40.041 --> 32:41.532
I thought you said
you were gonna bury Oliver.

32:41.835 --> 32:43.918
- That was the plan.
- What made you change your mind?

32:45.380 --> 32:46.370
You did.

32:48.008 --> 32:50.216
The first step to standing up to him
is to stand up to him.

32:54.014 --> 32:56.006
- You can't stay in town.
- Don't worry.

32:56.850 --> 32:59.137
Thanks to you, I now know exactly
what I have to do.

33:05.775 --> 33:09.894
Earlier, Judge McGarvey said
it fell upon you, the jury,

33:10.489 --> 33:13.527
to sort out what he deemed to be a mess.

33:14.659 --> 33:17.367
True, we have contradicting witnesses,

33:17.871 --> 33:20.454
and, yes, we have
conflicting testimonies.

33:20.832 --> 33:23.324
But that is not a mess,
ladies and gentlemen.

33:23.877 --> 33:26.085
That is the textbook definition

33:26.463 --> 33:28.204
of reasonable doubt.

33:37.807 --> 33:40.049
Fifteen minutes
after being taken into custody,

33:40.268 --> 33:43.557
Tommy Merlyn was freed by members
of the Green Arrow's team.

33:44.022 --> 33:48.016
Now, you might take that as evidence
that he is in fact the Green Arrow,

33:48.109 --> 33:52.479
but I would like to offer you
a much more plausible explanation.

33:52.572 --> 33:58.318
And that is, Oliver Queen has people
and resources at his disposal

33:58.411 --> 34:01.154
to do whatever it takes
to keep his secrets.

34:01.581 --> 34:04.995
And don't think that doesn't mean
someone falling out of the sky

34:05.168 --> 34:08.411
into this courtroom with a false face
and a made-up story,

34:08.755 --> 34:11.589
because Tommy Merlyn
is just another Roy Harper.

34:12.217 --> 34:13.958
He's just another man

34:14.052 --> 34:16.886
willing to go to prison
to cover up the crimes

34:16.972 --> 34:18.759
that that man committed.

34:19.558 --> 34:21.299
Don't let him get away with it.

34:22.185 --> 34:23.426
Not again.

34:25.188 --> 34:27.429
Not ever again.

34:30.443 --> 34:31.853
What happens now?

34:33.446 --> 34:34.652
It's up to the jury.

34:35.739 --> 34:36.856
Yeah, but...

34:37.492 --> 34:39.279
What if Diaz got to them too?

34:43.581 --> 34:44.572
Dad!

34:45.583 --> 34:46.574
Hey.

34:51.965 --> 34:53.922
William, I love you very much.

34:54.759 --> 34:56.466
I love both of you very much.

34:56.803 --> 34:59.511
And whatever happens,
nothing is gonna change that.

34:59.598 --> 35:01.339
- What do you mean?
- I mean that

35:01.600 --> 35:04.468
the man who wants me in prison

35:05.353 --> 35:06.594
controls the judge,

35:06.730 --> 35:10.144
and we think it's a pretty good bet
that he has

35:11.276 --> 35:13.017
a strong influence over the jury.

35:13.194 --> 35:14.901
- What does that mean?
- It means...

35:15.822 --> 35:16.812
I might be going to prison.

35:18.366 --> 35:19.356
Okay?

35:19.951 --> 35:21.158
If that happens,

35:21.661 --> 35:25.405
Felicity has assured me

35:26.207 --> 35:28.199
that she is going to make sure

35:29.002 --> 35:30.288
you grow into the man

35:31.921 --> 35:33.332
that I know you can be.

35:33.840 --> 35:35.047
I don't want you to go.

35:35.592 --> 35:36.708
I don't want to go, either.

35:39.179 --> 35:40.886
Okay, I don't...

35:43.099 --> 35:45.011
I wish it was up to me but it's not.

35:46.728 --> 35:50.221
You are strong like me.

35:50.732 --> 35:51.768
Stronger even.

35:53.026 --> 35:54.267
So, whatever happens,

35:56.529 --> 35:57.770
and wherever I am...

36:03.453 --> 36:05.695
You need to know that I am always

36:06.206 --> 36:07.617
right here with you.

36:14.047 --> 36:15.663
- What is it?
- JEAN: Jury's back.

36:16.299 --> 36:17.415
We have a verdict.

36:24.557 --> 36:26.014
JUDGE: Will the defendant please rise?

36:27.060 --> 36:28.517
Please publish the verdict.

36:29.562 --> 36:31.349
In the matter of
<i>The People v. Oliver Queen,</i>

36:31.439 --> 36:33.351
on all 26 counts of the indictment,

36:33.483 --> 36:35.065
we find the defendant...

36:35.235 --> 36:36.225
Guilty.

JUDGE: Members of the jury, the court
thanks you for your service.

36:41.658 --> 36:42.694
You're dismissed.

36:43.034 --> 36:46.402
Defense moves for judgment
notwithstanding the verdict.

36:47.038 --> 36:50.406
Ms. Loring, as you know,
the standard for granting a JNOV

36:50.500 --> 36:53.664
requires a verdict that no
reasonable jury could arrive at.

37:00.427 --> 37:01.963
I find such a circumstance here.

37:03.304 --> 37:04.340
Your Honor...

37:04.431 --> 37:06.889
JUDGE: The evidence presented
was so conflicting

37:07.058 --> 37:08.845
that it created reasonable doubt.

37:09.394 --> 37:11.852
The defense motion for judgment
notwithstanding the verdict

37:11.938 --> 37:12.928
is granted.

37:13.440 --> 37:15.602
Mr. Queen, see Probation,

37:16.025 --> 37:17.015
then you're free to go.

37:17.694 --> 37:18.901
(GAVEL BANGS)

37:24.325 --> 37:25.861
Oh, my God, how is this possible?

37:26.286 --> 37:27.276
I don't know.

37:35.545 --> 37:36.706
Congratulations, man.

37:37.130 --> 37:38.246
Thank you.

37:38.339 --> 37:40.331
I'm surprised Judge McGarvey
had it in him, you know.

37:40.467 --> 37:42.459
I totally thought
he was in the tank for Diaz.

37:42.719 --> 37:43.960
JUDGE: I absolutely am.

37:44.763 --> 37:46.720
And Mr. Diaz isn't the forgiving type.

37:52.020 --> 37:53.010
Surprise.

37:53.313 --> 37:54.554
Wait, wait...

37:55.190 --> 37:57.227
- When did you...
- During jury deliberation.

37:57.734 --> 38:00.272
You know, the Judge can argue
that he got rolled,

38:00.361 --> 38:01.568
but no one's gonna believe him.

38:02.071 --> 38:03.653
Thanks again, man.
I owe you another one.

38:03.782 --> 38:06.525
Yeah, well, after Kasnia,
let's just call it even.

38:07.035 --> 38:08.025
Chris...

38:09.412 --> 38:11.574
- Thank you.
- Yeah, always happy to help.

38:12.207 --> 38:15.496
Just try not to need me again,
for at least another year.

38:17.378 --> 38:18.368
Okay?

38:19.756 --> 38:22.464
That was a brilliant move. Thank you.

38:22.717 --> 38:24.754
Well, I wish I could take the credit,
Oliver, but...

38:25.261 --> 38:26.797
It wasn't my idea.

38:28.056 --> 38:29.297
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING ON TV)

38:29.390 --> 38:30.881
Dad, you might wanna close your eyes
for this part.

38:31.267 --> 38:33.600
That was just one time I was scared.
That's not cool.

38:33.770 --> 38:35.432
- That's not cool at all.

Is it the guy from the courtroom?

38:39.609 --> 38:40.645
I said go now.

39:05.343 --> 39:07.255
You can take a shot at me
if you want to.

39:07.428 --> 39:11.092
Just, it's gonna ruin me
saying thank you.

39:11.224 --> 39:12.431
Can't be too safe.

(DOOR CLOSES)

39:19.357 --> 39:21.098
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

39:22.694 --> 39:24.526
When I rolled over on you last November,

39:24.612 --> 39:26.023
I was thinking about my kid,

39:26.114 --> 39:27.980
even though I knew it meant
it'd take you away from yours.

39:31.953 --> 39:32.943
I'm really sorry.

39:33.454 --> 39:34.615
Apology accepted.

39:35.832 --> 39:36.993
Look, I'm sorry if I

39:38.501 --> 39:41.460
made you feel like you
couldn't come to me

39:41.546 --> 39:43.037
when Watson put you in that position.

39:45.842 --> 39:48.084
I'm very sorry for everything
that happened afterwards.

39:58.271 --> 39:59.933
I'd never do that! It's me...

40:03.484 --> 40:05.225
It wasn't me, I swear.

40:06.946 --> 40:09.484
The only law that I abide by

40:09.991 --> 40:12.233
is following through on my word.

40:13.369 --> 40:14.530
You failed at that.

40:16.497 --> 40:18.079
So what would you have me do?

40:18.541 --> 40:21.875
Two men, they broke into my chambers,
they knocked me out...

40:26.049 --> 40:27.881
The legal system in this country

40:29.928 --> 40:31.294
is going to hell.

40:43.024 --> 40:44.981
after the crap you pulled in court.

40:45.276 --> 40:46.266
No.

I'm smart enough to know
there's no place I can run
