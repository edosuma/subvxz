00:07.183 --> 00:08.733
<i>Previously, on</i> House of Lies...

00:08.768 --> 00:10.101
Jeannie, you're in the clear.

00:10.103 --> 00:12.437
<i> I guess I taught</i>
<i>you well, huh, Jeannie?</i>

00:12.489 --> 00:13.988
<i>You out-Marty'd Marty Kaan.</i>

00:14.023 --> 00:15.440
<i> The fact</i>
<i>that we have to share space</i>

00:15.492 --> 00:16.824
<i>with those douchey</i>
<i>proto-fascist mavericks</i>

00:16.860 --> 00:19.494
makes me want to strap
a bomb to my chest.

00:19.529 --> 00:22.613
<i>If working for me is
such an unspeakable misery,</i>

00:22.665 --> 00:23.831
get another job.

00:23.867 --> 00:25.333
So this is where
you leverage me out.

00:25.368 --> 00:26.701
<i>You're a fucking
phony, Malcolm.</i>

00:26.753 --> 00:29.036
And you're a fucking
sellout, Martin,

00:29.088 --> 00:31.339
<i>but we're still brothers.</i>
<i>I'm pregnant, Marty.</i>

00:31.374 --> 00:33.090
Are you telling me that we're...
No.

00:33.126 --> 00:35.259
<i>After everything between us,</i>

00:35.295 --> 00:37.011
I rekindled something
with Edwin.

00:37.046 --> 00:39.096
Yes!
<i>I wouldn't have tricked</i>

00:39.132 --> 00:40.932
<i>anybody else into marrying me.</i>

00:40.967 --> 00:42.127
I need to tell you something.

00:42.135 --> 00:42.884
I panicked,

00:42.936 --> 00:44.635
and I... said Edwin.

00:44.687 --> 00:45.970
It's yours.

00:46.022 --> 00:47.138
<i>Can't really get over</i>

00:47.190 --> 00:48.523
<i>everything that's happened,</i>

00:48.558 --> 00:50.475
but we need to just get
through this transition,

00:50.527 --> 00:53.311
and then you should
leave, for good.

01:09.162 --> 01:10.912
? <i> Dig a little deeper</i> ?

01:10.964 --> 01:13.214
? Been thinking ?

01:13.249 --> 01:16.083
? 'Bout the little thing
you said ?

01:16.135 --> 01:19.253
? Doesn't sink in ?

01:19.305 --> 01:22.507
? And you fought above my head ?

01:22.559 --> 01:26.010
? And I don't think I'm ready
to go in this heavy ?

01:26.012 --> 01:29.146
? I thought we would take it slow ?

01:29.182 --> 01:31.315
? And now you got that feeling ?

01:31.351 --> 01:32.984
? You say that you mean it ?

01:33.019 --> 01:35.269
? But for me I just don't know ?

01:35.321 --> 01:36.687
? Ooh, ooh, ooh ?

01:36.739 --> 01:39.690
? I can't see it,
I don't feel it ?

01:39.742 --> 01:42.660
? I need to dig
a little deeper ?

01:42.695 --> 01:44.445
? I can't say that ?

01:44.497 --> 01:46.280
? I won't say it back ?

01:46.332 --> 01:48.866
? I need to dig

01:48.918 --> 01:50.201

02:13.226 --> 02:14.775

? I can't see it ?

02:22.201 --> 02:23.818

Fuck it.

02:23.870 --> 02:26.821

02:32.745 --> 02:34.211
Hey. Lazybones.

02:34.247 --> 02:35.630
What?
Get up

02:35.665 --> 02:37.331
and fuck your ovulating wife.

02:37.383 --> 02:38.299
What?

02:38.334 --> 02:41.052
Use the Fuck Force, Doug.

02:41.087 --> 02:42.253
Oh, um, no, no, no. Uh-uh.

02:42.305 --> 02:43.545
Sweetie, can you not touch him?

02:43.556 --> 02:44.672
Wait... Oh, you've got
two of them?

02:44.724 --> 02:45.840
No, no, no.
It's just...

02:45.892 --> 02:48.175
the value diminishes
exponentially.

02:48.227 --> 02:49.320
But I want to be touched.

02:49.440 --> 02:51.320
I need to be touched.
They don't talk like that.

02:51.347 --> 02:54.265
I will die
without human contact!

02:54.267 --> 02:55.933
Oh, God, you're scraping.
Don't scrape them,

02:55.935 --> 02:57.735
because you'll scratch
the surface. Sarah!

02:57.770 --> 02:59.654
Good morning.
Hey.

02:59.689 --> 03:02.073
You want breakfast?
Uh, no, I got company.

03:02.108 --> 03:03.824
Big shocker.

03:03.860 --> 03:07.078
I could hear you guys doing it all night.
Hey.

03:07.113 --> 03:08.613
No, seriously, Marty.

03:08.615 --> 03:11.082
I'm already fucked up enough.

03:11.117 --> 03:12.833
Sorry.

03:12.869 --> 03:14.418
Language...

03:14.454 --> 03:16.170
and don't call you Marty.

03:16.205 --> 03:17.872
Well done.

03:17.924 --> 03:20.007
So, you gonna watch Uncle
Malcolm's big debut tonight?

03:20.043 --> 03:21.709
Oh, let me think. No.

03:21.761 --> 03:23.461
Well, he's really
excited about it.

03:23.463 --> 03:24.962
I know.
When baby goes poopy,

03:24.964 --> 03:26.797
we're supposed
to make a big fuss.

03:26.799 --> 03:29.300
It's a big deal to him.
Yeah, but here's the thing.

03:29.302 --> 03:30.551
I'm going to Seattle,

03:30.603 --> 03:32.637
and they just don't have TV yet.

03:32.689 --> 03:34.305
Oh. I didn't
know that.

03:34.307 --> 03:36.140
Yeah, I mean, they're just behind.
Is that right?

03:36.192 --> 03:37.525
They'll catch up.
Okay.

03:37.560 --> 03:39.560
What is it gonna take, Doug?
Well, it certainly

03:39.612 --> 03:43.731
won't involve depreciating
a valuable investment, Sarah.

03:43.783 --> 03:45.449
This is a toy for a geek.

03:45.485 --> 03:46.867
This? No, no, wrong.
Yes, that.

03:46.903 --> 03:49.153
Incorrect. Uh-uh.
No, these all

03:49.155 --> 03:52.406
are valuable investments--
like-like art or fine wine.

03:52.458 --> 03:54.625
Well, I'm pretty sure fine wine
isn't humiliating

03:54.661 --> 03:57.328
to have all over your house.
What were you doing to her?!

03:57.330 --> 03:59.130
Please.
What? I'm just holding it.

03:59.165 --> 04:01.632
Okay, would you prefer I keep
them in an art storage facility?

04:01.668 --> 04:04.719
Oh, man, did you just say
"art storage facility"?

04:04.754 --> 04:07.171
You can't even take them
out of the box. You know that.

04:07.173 --> 04:08.506
And you're touching
everything-- your oily fingers

04:08.508 --> 04:10.007
and the fecal matter all over them.
Hey.

04:10.009 --> 04:11.592
If I got a black light and I...

04:11.644 --> 04:14.345
Hey, are we gonna get
in this bed... and do it?

04:14.347 --> 04:17.932
- Oh... - Or are you going
to make me be bad teacher?

04:17.983 --> 04:20.483
Miss Pendegast?

04:20.519 --> 04:21.902
Mm-hmm.

04:21.938 --> 04:24.605
She's very mean today.

04:24.657 --> 04:26.941
Well, yes, she has
every right to be.

04:26.993 --> 04:29.160
And I'm so sorry
that I have been

04:29.195 --> 04:33.080
so bad in biology...
Miss Pendegast.

04:33.116 --> 04:35.666
Frankly, Douglas, your
grades have been perverted.

04:35.702 --> 04:40.371
Well, is there anything I can do
to get my grades... up?

04:40.373 --> 04:42.339
We acquired it
at three bucks a share

04:42.375 --> 04:43.791
and dumped it at $240.

04:43.843 --> 04:45.876
So yeah, there can be
some collateral damage,

04:45.878 --> 04:49.847
but when you're profit-taking
in the billions... shit happens.

04:49.882 --> 04:51.599
God, I love when you
use the "B" word.

04:51.634 --> 04:52.800
So when are you gonna

04:52.852 --> 04:54.802
rape and pillage <i> my</i> company?

04:54.854 --> 04:57.972
Mm. I think I'm gonna stick
to raping and pillaging you.

04:58.024 --> 04:59.640
Whoa, don't threaten me
with a good time.

04:59.692 --> 05:02.193
Oh, I will.
I will flip this table over right now.

05:02.228 --> 05:03.778
I'll make it happen.
Really?

05:03.813 --> 05:05.696
Well, no, seriously,
though, I mean...

05:05.732 --> 05:08.566
why wouldn't Global want to
acquire a company like mine?

05:08.568 --> 05:11.652
With this Gage account coming
in, all this attention,

05:11.704 --> 05:13.904
we're gonna be fucking huge.

05:13.906 --> 05:16.207
No, no, educate me.
Well,

05:16.242 --> 05:20.878
unlike its namesake, your
company is ultimately... teensy.

05:20.913 --> 05:22.463
Oh, that's a dick reference.

05:22.498 --> 05:23.998
Mmm. Yeah, that's right.
Got it.

05:24.050 --> 05:26.751
Okay, well, I'll just escape
with the compliment, then.

05:26.753 --> 05:29.670
I mean, if I could take Kaan and
Associates and, like, ten other

05:29.722 --> 05:31.305
management firms
and put them in a blender

05:31.340 --> 05:33.057
and strain the fat, then maybe.

05:33.092 --> 05:36.310
Okay, so you're saying
if K and A were part of a...

05:36.345 --> 05:39.230
delicious management consultancy
bouillabaisse...

05:39.265 --> 05:41.348
Mmm. Yummy.

05:41.400 --> 05:43.267
Yummy.

05:48.908 --> 05:50.858
Kelsey.

05:52.278 --> 05:54.111
Hey, Doug.
Oh, hey.

05:54.113 --> 05:57.198
'Sup?
Well, you know, not <i> much.</i>

05:57.250 --> 05:59.116
Not <i> much.</i>

05:59.168 --> 06:00.618
What's wrong with you?

06:00.620 --> 06:02.586
Like a Muppet.
This is between me and Kelsey.

06:02.622 --> 06:05.372
Right. Okay. So, how's it going
at the day care center?

06:05.424 --> 06:09.210
Hey... guy whose name
I don't remember,

06:09.262 --> 06:10.711
you're awesome,
or whatever, but I made

06:10.763 --> 06:12.012
a solemn vow, like,
six months ago

06:12.048 --> 06:14.181
not to date any assholes
for a year, so...

06:14.217 --> 06:15.716
mark your calendar.
Why don't we

06:15.768 --> 06:17.301
slow down there, Peter Pan.
What would give you

06:17.303 --> 06:18.686
the impression
that I want to date you

06:18.721 --> 06:20.604
in the first place?
I mean...

06:20.640 --> 06:23.691
you're not even
in my arousal template.

06:23.726 --> 06:26.310
- Bye, Doug.
- Bye.

06:26.312 --> 06:27.945
You're n... she's not
in my arousal template.

06:27.980 --> 06:29.530
- You know that for a fact.
- Hey.

06:29.565 --> 06:30.531
Tom and Jerry.

06:30.566 --> 06:31.699
Oh, and by the way,

06:31.734 --> 06:33.095
Peter Pan is not
a put-down, Clyde.

06:33.119 --> 06:34.201
I think you're
forgetting Cathy Rigby.

06:34.237 --> 06:35.870
I would tap that.
Oh, yes.

06:35.905 --> 06:38.322
Peter Pan is a boy-- so you
want to have sex with a boy?

06:38.324 --> 06:40.958
No. Uh-uh. No, no, she is a girl
who looks like a boy. Okay?

06:40.993 --> 06:42.493
Let's talk brand
analysis for Krolls.

06:42.495 --> 06:44.795
I don't think we can walk
in there and just wing it.

06:44.831 --> 06:45.913
Yeah, so I pulled
their P-and-L's.

06:45.965 --> 06:47.131
They're very solid, okay?

06:47.166 --> 06:48.487
I've put together
a plug-and-play,

06:48.501 --> 06:50.167
did a SWOT analysis...
I would kind of like

06:50.169 --> 06:51.719
to run it against the
Five Forces Analysis.

06:51.754 --> 06:53.888
Hey, kiddies, I got it, okay?

06:53.923 --> 06:55.806
Okay, do you want to share it?

06:55.842 --> 06:57.758
Just draft off my Mensa shit.

06:57.810 --> 07:00.144
You know, I actually have
some ideas of my own.

07:00.179 --> 07:01.846
I know that might shock you.
Really?

07:01.848 --> 07:03.514
You know, when
Mommy and Daddy fight,

07:03.516 --> 07:04.982
it hurts me
in my no-no place.

07:05.017 --> 07:07.017
Your n... your dick.
It hurts you in your dick.

07:07.069 --> 07:08.402
Yes, my dick.
Okay, Krolls...

07:08.437 --> 07:10.104
beloved folksy
skin-care line-- good--

07:10.156 --> 07:12.323
has plateaued-- bad--
and they are looking

07:12.358 --> 07:15.492
to K and A, now that we're
all shiny and new again,

07:15.528 --> 07:17.244
to lead them
to the promised land.

07:17.280 --> 07:18.612
Hallelujah!

07:18.664 --> 07:20.164
Don't.
What?

07:20.199 --> 07:23.083
The upside is that this
engagement is wide open, okay?

07:23.119 --> 07:25.836
We can write our own ticket.
You really don't care

07:25.872 --> 07:27.838
about my input on this
engagement, do you?

07:27.874 --> 07:29.273
Define "care."

07:29.308 --> 07:30.708
Their brand health

07:30.743 --> 07:32.343
is excellent, okay?

07:32.378 --> 07:34.628
And all their survey metrics
around intent to purchase

07:34.680 --> 07:36.680
are off the charts.
They're on the charts,

07:36.716 --> 07:38.515
and skin care is a
red ocean, Martin.

07:38.551 --> 07:39.800
We just need to demonstrate

07:39.852 --> 07:41.185
that their current
management structure--

07:41.220 --> 07:43.520
with, you know, a little
assistance from K and A--

07:43.556 --> 07:45.472
can convert their brand
to rock star status.

07:45.524 --> 07:47.474
That's it.
Or, conversely, we can encourage them

07:47.526 --> 07:49.777
to sell to a major,
do some profit-sharing

07:49.812 --> 07:52.947
and enjoy their house in the San Juan Islands.
Wrong.

07:52.982 --> 07:55.232
Oh, my God!
Dude, you can't...

07:55.234 --> 07:57.151
You hit me in the balls!
Hey.

07:57.203 --> 07:59.236
Thank you, by the way, Jeannie.
Thank you for all this.

07:59.238 --> 08:01.038
Fuck you, Clyde.
No, no, no, I think

08:01.073 --> 08:02.623
it's important to give
credit where credit is due,

08:02.658 --> 08:03.791
and you're the
unwitting architect

08:03.826 --> 08:05.542
of our new austerity program,

08:05.578 --> 08:07.578
so thank you again for all of this.
Okay. You know what?

08:07.580 --> 08:09.296
Once Marty and I sew up
the Gage account,

08:09.332 --> 08:11.081
your balls will be back
in first, you dick.

08:11.083 --> 08:12.549
- Thank you.
- No, hey, hey,

08:12.585 --> 08:15.302
hey, hey, no, uh-uh--
I called Marty Shotgun.

08:15.338 --> 08:16.887
Why do you always
get Marty Shotgun?

08:16.923 --> 08:18.973
He doesn't want
to sit next to you, Doug.

08:19.008 --> 08:21.976
Why not? You're the asshole.
Says a tattooed code writer.

08:22.011 --> 08:23.844
Okay? And asshole
is way better than

08:23.896 --> 08:25.646
utterly intolerable.
Really?

08:25.681 --> 08:27.982
Do you really think
I'm an asshole?

08:28.017 --> 08:30.734
Yeah. But that's kind of
your brand, you know?

08:30.770 --> 08:32.403
People see you
and they're like, "Oh, look,

08:32.438 --> 08:34.020
"it's Clyde, what an asshole,
what a great...

08:34.073 --> 08:36.190
Asshole.
asshole." Yeah.

08:36.241 --> 08:37.775
Am I really intolerable?

08:37.777 --> 08:39.025
Yes.
Yes.

08:42.114 --> 08:45.282
So, we know Krolls has
deep brand equity.

08:45.334 --> 08:48.836
Mm-hmm. Now, with 30% awareness,
with $20 million per point,

08:48.871 --> 08:51.588
that's $600 million
in brand equity,

08:51.624 --> 08:53.841
just for marketing
and brand recognition alone.

08:53.876 --> 08:55.259
That's excluding valuations

08:55.294 --> 08:57.211
of inventory and infrastructure,

08:57.263 --> 08:58.879
which, based
on our statistical models,

08:58.931 --> 09:00.597
that's another $500 million.

09:00.633 --> 09:03.550
We're looking
at a very valuable brand here.

09:03.602 --> 09:06.854
Always nice to hear, but how do
we take it to the next level?

09:07.974 --> 09:09.773
You double down, Daddy.
Big-time.

09:11.727 --> 09:12.893
How?

09:12.945 --> 09:14.561
We make Krolls
an entertainment brand.

09:14.613 --> 09:16.897
Okay, we push awareness
into the stratosphere

09:16.949 --> 09:19.199
with celebrity endorsements,

09:19.235 --> 09:20.784
big media tie-ins.

09:20.820 --> 09:22.369
Major brick-and-mortar
build-outs.

09:22.405 --> 09:26.123
Look, listen, you guys are going
to kick the ass of every

09:26.158 --> 09:27.574
skin-care line out there, okay,

09:27.626 --> 09:29.159
because you are utterly unique
in the marketplace.

09:29.161 --> 09:30.911
Or...

09:30.963 --> 09:33.414
you sell to a huge
multinational,

09:33.466 --> 09:36.417
you make about 800 million
shitloads of money,

09:36.469 --> 09:38.836
you let us walk you through
the transition, and you

09:38.838 --> 09:40.671
enjoy being grandparents,
enjoy your lives.

09:40.673 --> 09:42.723
You live a little.

09:42.758 --> 09:44.508
What's the point of running
yourself into the ground?

09:44.510 --> 09:46.593
You guys have built
something amazing already.

09:46.645 --> 09:47.811
Or-or-or...

09:47.847 --> 09:49.396
you can take this
amazing company

09:49.432 --> 09:51.598
that you've already built
and see it to fruition...

09:51.650 --> 09:54.068
This is a graph of
awareness investment erosion.

09:54.103 --> 09:57.738
Say you go Marty's way
and it costs

09:57.773 --> 10:00.324
$100 million each to launch
five line extensions,

10:00.359 --> 10:02.659
giving you a five-point bump
in awareness,

10:02.695 --> 10:04.995
which is really only
a $20 million profit,

10:05.031 --> 10:06.363
given the current 24% margin,

10:06.365 --> 10:08.499
so Marty's plan

10:08.534 --> 10:11.118
is a great way
to lose $80 million fast.

10:11.170 --> 10:12.286
Whoa.

10:12.338 --> 10:14.004
In all fairness,
this is just theoretical.

10:14.040 --> 10:16.206
We haven't really run it through
our... all of our metrics.

10:16.208 --> 10:18.425
Also very interesting.

10:18.461 --> 10:20.177
So, Jeannie,

10:20.212 --> 10:22.629
are you going to be running
point on this project?

10:22.681 --> 10:24.214
I would certainly... I...

10:24.216 --> 10:25.883
It's... Marty,
would I be running point?

10:25.885 --> 10:28.685
Or... am I out on the street?

10:28.721 --> 10:31.638
Get your cardboard box ready.

10:32.808 --> 10:34.108
No, no. No, no.

10:34.143 --> 10:35.692
This is... this is it, though.

10:35.728 --> 10:37.611
Consulting at its best.

10:37.646 --> 10:39.279
Very spirited exchange of ideas.

10:39.315 --> 10:41.532
This is how we take
a great company like yours

10:41.567 --> 10:43.200
and push it to be even greater.

10:43.235 --> 10:46.320
I mean, this, all of this,
we-we hope

10:46.372 --> 10:48.122
this demonstrates
how Kaan and Associates

10:48.157 --> 10:51.241
can help your company to really
reach its apotheosis.

10:51.243 --> 10:52.876
So, let's just do this.

10:52.912 --> 10:55.129
Let's regroup tomorrow,
and we will present you with

10:55.164 --> 10:57.081
our very detailed
brand strategy.

10:57.083 --> 10:58.999
I think... I-I think you're
going to be amazed.

10:59.051 --> 11:00.417
I really do.

11:01.720 --> 11:03.971
Fuck!

11:04.006 --> 11:06.173
? And some may cry ?
Mm!

11:06.225 --> 11:08.342
? And some may bleed ?
Ooh. Yeah.

11:08.394 --> 11:10.727
? You're waging wars inside of me... ?

11:10.763 --> 11:12.679
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

11:12.731 --> 11:14.014
One more round of absinthe,
thank you, sir.

11:14.066 --> 11:15.349
Drink 'em slow.
They're deadly.

11:15.401 --> 11:17.401
Uh, I think I know
a little something

11:17.436 --> 11:18.902
about absinthe, my friend.

11:18.938 --> 11:20.487
It's hallucinogenic.
I tell people,

11:20.523 --> 11:22.439
'cause there's a tendency
to creep up on 'em...

11:22.441 --> 11:24.274
I just said I know all about it.
Doug...

11:24.276 --> 11:26.527
Like that.
It's happening already.

11:26.579 --> 11:28.278
He's not listening, you know?
Doug,

11:28.280 --> 11:29.913
I don't even like absinthe,

11:29.949 --> 11:31.582
and I will drink anything
that makes me forget.

11:31.617 --> 11:32.916
Do you know what Oscar Wilde
said about absinthe?

11:32.952 --> 11:34.535
I do.
I wasn't asking you, guy!

11:34.587 --> 11:36.453
You're probably going to want
to get out of the line of fire.

11:36.505 --> 11:37.704
You know you made
a mistake, right?

11:37.756 --> 11:39.790
He's wearing
his fighting glasses.

11:39.792 --> 11:41.842
He said the first glass
of absinthe

11:41.877 --> 11:44.761
makes you see things the way
you wish they were.

11:44.797 --> 11:46.263
Oh.
And after the second,

11:46.298 --> 11:47.965
you see thing
the way they are not.

11:47.967 --> 11:49.600
They're not.
Finally,

11:49.635 --> 11:51.852
well, then you see things
the way they really are,

11:51.887 --> 11:53.270
and that, my friends,

11:53.305 --> 11:55.522
that is the most horrible thing
of all.

11:55.558 --> 11:57.057
To you, absinthe.

11:57.109 --> 11:58.976
You do know that's
a sipping drink, right?

11:58.978 --> 12:01.612
You're about to get a brick in the face.
I know how to drink absinthe, man.

12:01.647 --> 12:03.848
Gunning for...
Marty. Marty, Marty, Marty, Marty, Marty.

12:05.401 --> 12:07.484
Shit.

12:07.486 --> 12:10.204
I think it's pretty clear what
Sister Meghan is talking about.

12:10.239 --> 12:12.039
There's a complete
and total denial

12:12.074 --> 12:14.491
of the essential Black
Experience in White America.

12:14.493 --> 12:16.410
Mr. Kaan, I'm
not going to sit here

12:16.462 --> 12:18.412
and be goaded
into a conversation

12:18.464 --> 12:20.247
about racial injustice
in America

12:20.299 --> 12:22.082
simply because you cannot
rebut my point.

12:22.134 --> 12:23.717
Oh, wow.

12:23.752 --> 12:25.586
Wow. No, the point is,

12:25.638 --> 12:28.555
White America and white folk
are just tired of hearing it.

12:28.591 --> 12:30.140
My own brother, Martin,

12:30.176 --> 12:33.594
sat in a federal prison
for six months

12:33.646 --> 12:37.431
because our patriarchal, uh,
kangaroo court system

12:37.483 --> 12:38.932
denied him due process!

12:38.984 --> 12:41.185
Well, I know we all
certainly look forward

12:41.237 --> 12:43.604
to watching this on cable news
for the next month.

12:44.990 --> 12:46.523
? Oh, oh, oh, oh ?

12:46.575 --> 12:49.359
? You shake
and rattle my bones ?

12:49.361 --> 12:51.245
Yeah. Yeah.

12:51.280 --> 12:53.413
Yeah, we're definitely
going to need beverages now.

12:53.449 --> 12:55.332
? Why do you break me down so? ?

12:55.367 --> 12:57.501
? Oh, oh, oh, oh ?

12:57.536 --> 13:01.038
? You shake
and rattle my bones ?

13:03.000 --> 13:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:11.016 --> 13:13.133
? Oh, oh, oh, oh ?

13:13.185 --> 13:16.937
? Why do you break me down so? ?

13:16.972 --> 13:19.723
? Oh, oh, oh, oh ?

13:19.725 --> 13:22.893
? You shake
and rattle my bones ?

13:22.895 --> 13:25.696
? Oh, oh, oh, oh,
why do you break me down so? ?

13:25.731 --> 13:27.314
<i>Right, because, you know,</i>

13:27.366 --> 13:29.066
it used to make for
great sex, always,

13:29.118 --> 13:31.702
but then it gets to a point,
then it's just too crazy.

13:31.737 --> 13:32.986
You know, and the baby thing.

13:33.038 --> 13:34.655
Now she's just,
"We, we, we, we."

13:34.707 --> 13:37.185
She's giving funny voices
to my action figures.

13:37.305 --> 13:38.292
Your...
Action figures?

13:38.327 --> 13:39.576
Your...
Action figures.

13:39.578 --> 13:41.161
Your...
You have action figures?

13:41.213 --> 13:44.047
Yeah. Really?
That's shocking to you?

13:44.083 --> 13:45.415
No.
They're...

13:45.417 --> 13:46.967
They're valuable
collector's items, Clyde.

13:47.002 --> 13:48.418
Yeah, it's true.
I've never even

13:48.470 --> 13:50.470
taken them out of the...
out of the packaging.

13:50.506 --> 13:52.422
Oh, that makes it much less pathetic.
Right?

13:52.424 --> 13:54.341
Still in the packaging.
That's not even the worst of it, man.

13:54.393 --> 13:55.676
Go, go.
Oh, please tell me.

13:55.728 --> 13:57.761
Ugh, I can't shake this feeling.

13:57.763 --> 13:59.980
Maybe I'm crazy, um, but

14:00.015 --> 14:02.816
I get this feeling that she
might murder me in my sleep.

14:02.851 --> 14:04.985
Do you get that vibe?
I could see it.

14:05.020 --> 14:07.104
Yeah.
You know what? If I was going to murder you,

14:07.106 --> 14:08.739
that's when I would do it.
That's what I think she's thinking.

14:08.774 --> 14:09.823
And with the arrests
and everything...

14:09.858 --> 14:11.241
I'm sorry.

14:11.277 --> 14:13.910
What did you say? What did you just say?
Stop it.

14:13.946 --> 14:15.279
It's not funny, Clyde.

14:15.281 --> 14:16.496
It's kind of funny.
It's not.

14:16.532 --> 14:18.999
No. She has a very alarming

14:19.034 --> 14:23.003
and real history of, uh,
nude stalking.

14:23.038 --> 14:24.921
Nude stalking.

14:24.957 --> 14:25.922
Yes, nude stalking.

14:25.958 --> 14:27.424
No, no, no, Marty.

14:27.459 --> 14:28.709
Nude stalking.
Don't tell people that.

14:28.761 --> 14:30.177
I shouldn't have even told you.

14:30.212 --> 14:31.678
But now that I have...

14:31.714 --> 14:33.347
You might as well keep going.

14:33.382 --> 14:36.350
She was arrested in the yard
of an ex-boyfriend

14:36.385 --> 14:38.468
au naturel.

14:38.470 --> 14:42.022
Twice. She's even done some
time at UCLA Psychiatric.

14:42.057 --> 14:45.025
Quick question: Of course that's
the same boyfriend for both times?

14:45.060 --> 14:46.693
Two different boyfriends.

14:46.729 --> 14:47.944
That's serial nude stalker.

14:47.980 --> 14:49.813
Um...
Serial nude stalker.

14:49.815 --> 14:51.398
Oh, fuck.
What's happening?

14:51.450 --> 14:52.816
I just came a little bit.
Ooh.

14:52.818 --> 14:54.534
I got too excited 'cause
you said serial nude...

14:54.570 --> 14:56.236
If it was one person.
No, I get it, I get it.

14:56.288 --> 14:57.621
Sensitive, sensitive, sensitive.
Oh.

14:57.656 --> 15:00.073
Yep. I have to confront her.

15:00.125 --> 15:01.992
I do. It's clear to me.
I have to confront her.

15:01.994 --> 15:04.628
You're going to confront her, Doug?
Sweet, sweet Doug. Come on.

15:04.663 --> 15:05.962
You're the most passive-aggressive
motherfucker I ever met.

15:05.998 --> 15:07.297
There's no way you're
going to confront her.

15:07.333 --> 15:08.882
I mean, not directly.

15:08.917 --> 15:11.335
Oh, okay, would a
passive-aggressive motherfucker

15:11.337 --> 15:14.588
text somebody so they don't have
to talk to them face-to-face?

15:14.640 --> 15:16.223
That's... that's actually
the defini...

15:16.258 --> 15:18.225
That's a passive-aggressive
text confrontation.

15:18.260 --> 15:20.844
Okay, then yeah.
Fine, I'm not arguing with you.

15:20.846 --> 15:22.062
And guess what I'm doing,

15:22.097 --> 15:23.397
'cause I'm going
to tell her right now.

15:23.432 --> 15:24.765
I have to.
Things have got to change.

15:24.817 --> 15:26.233
And she's got to stop
being so fucking crazy.

15:26.268 --> 15:27.567
I'm going to say that.

15:27.603 --> 15:29.353
Passive-aggressive
text confrontation.

15:29.355 --> 15:31.271
I can't believe I'm going to do
this, 'cause this goes against

15:31.323 --> 15:33.190
everything that we believe in, but...
Do it.

15:33.192 --> 15:34.941
maybe you don't text her. Maybe...
Oh, no.

15:34.993 --> 15:36.243
Oh, no, come on.
This is...

15:36.278 --> 15:37.744
Oscar Wilde was right.

15:37.780 --> 15:39.446
I'm finally seeing things
clearly

15:39.498 --> 15:40.697
for the very first time.

15:40.817 --> 15:43.386
Yeah. No, no, no.
It's time for Doug to take care of Doug.

15:43.506 --> 15:44.418
Goddamn right.
Right.

15:44.453 --> 15:46.503
That's right. Hey, man,
my wife is cray-cray, yo.

15:46.538 --> 15:48.121
Word.
Yeah, he gets it.

15:48.173 --> 15:50.424
No, he's fine.
He's fine.

15:50.459 --> 15:52.175
That's a first draft.
Let him keep going.

15:53.379 --> 15:55.095
<i>Dios mío.</i>

15:55.130 --> 15:56.596
Doug, are you serious?

15:56.632 --> 15:58.098
Don't text that last part.
Doug, this is

15:58.133 --> 15:59.383
a novel.
Hold up, hold up.

15:59.385 --> 16:01.351
Did you mean to say,

16:01.387 --> 16:03.770
"You are a crazy country"?

16:03.806 --> 16:05.389
It's auto correct, but
the word's still in there.

16:05.441 --> 16:07.057
The word... the first part
of that word makes sense.

16:07.059 --> 16:08.392
If she reads it out loud,
she'll get it.

16:08.444 --> 16:09.559
I'll fix that.

16:09.611 --> 16:11.228
Dude, this is
unbelievably harsh.

16:11.230 --> 16:12.791
How about this?
We go back to the hotel,

16:12.815 --> 16:14.564
we think about it, we
probably don't send it.

16:14.566 --> 16:16.233
Hold on a second.
Do you think that she's going

16:16.235 --> 16:18.201
to get the part here
where you say you feel like

16:18.237 --> 16:19.870
Oscar Wilde sitting in a cafe

16:19.905 --> 16:21.621
on the Left Bank having an epiphany?
Yeah.

16:21.657 --> 16:23.123
She'll get the gist.
It seems a little arch.

16:23.158 --> 16:24.624
I can't make it any clearer
than that, Marty.

16:24.660 --> 16:26.126
Fuck it, send it.
Yeah.

16:26.161 --> 16:28.161
Yeah, send it.
If you're an idiot, send it.

16:28.213 --> 16:30.130
Well, then so it shall be.

16:30.165 --> 16:32.165
Don't, you know, like...

16:40.259 --> 16:41.975
Did...
You just send it?

16:42.010 --> 16:43.677
Did you just send the text?

16:43.729 --> 16:46.263
Yeah, which... I pushed
that button there.

16:46.265 --> 16:47.647
That's send. That'll send it.
Yeah, that's send.

16:47.683 --> 16:50.600
You can't unsend something once you...?
No, no.

16:50.602 --> 16:53.103
I don't feel good.
That's regret.

16:53.105 --> 16:55.021
- Is that what it is? Okay.
- Yeah.

16:55.073 --> 16:56.239
Do you want
some more alcohol, maybe?

16:56.275 --> 16:58.608
Yes. Oh, good idea.

16:58.610 --> 17:00.827
Yeah, one more round of
absinthe, barkeep.

17:00.863 --> 17:02.245
But you can't unsend once...?

17:02.281 --> 17:03.447
No.
That's what I thought.

17:03.449 --> 17:05.248
Hey, Doug?
Yeah?

17:05.284 --> 17:08.335
Can you smell this and tell me
if you want to throw up from it.

17:08.369 --> 17:09.586
Huh?

17:09.621 --> 17:11.454
Oh, God, Clyde, stop it.

17:21.800 --> 17:24.134
Oh, shit.

17:27.138 --> 17:29.523
Good morning.
Good morning.

17:29.558 --> 17:30.941
Are you ready
to get your brand on?

17:30.976 --> 17:32.642
Yeah, well,
that's the thing, Marty.

17:32.644 --> 17:34.728
Mr. Kroll, if I could
just stop you, please.

17:34.780 --> 17:37.364
We've... we've traveled a...
traveled a long way

17:37.399 --> 17:39.950
and we really understand
this company.

17:39.985 --> 17:41.651
If you just give us
an opportunity...

17:41.653 --> 17:44.070
We thought your exploration
of our company

17:44.122 --> 17:45.622
was insightful, fresh, honest.

17:45.657 --> 17:47.824
Excellent. Excellent.

17:47.826 --> 17:50.577
And now, when we really
start to drill down...

17:50.629 --> 17:52.549
There's not going to be
any drilling down, Marty.

17:52.552 --> 17:53.547
Well, hold on a second.

17:53.667 --> 17:55.332
Why not? I mean, you
haven't seen us drill yet.

17:55.334 --> 17:56.216
We are excellent drillers.

17:56.251 --> 17:57.667
He was voted most likely
to drill.

17:57.669 --> 17:59.252
Show him, Doug. Show him.

17:59.304 --> 18:01.221
He will get
to the bottom of this.

18:01.256 --> 18:03.757
Your ideas are in direct conflict with Ms.
Van der Hooven's.

18:03.809 --> 18:05.509
And that is simply

18:05.511 --> 18:07.143
intolerable.
A company

18:07.179 --> 18:09.062
at war within itself
is not a company

18:09.097 --> 18:10.680
with which we can do business.

18:10.682 --> 18:12.349
Let me stop
you there for a second.

18:12.351 --> 18:14.100
I think the purpose of having
two different points of view...

18:14.152 --> 18:15.652
Mr. and Mrs. Kroll,
we really need this job.

18:15.687 --> 18:17.103
Personally, I'm going through
a tough time right now.

18:17.155 --> 18:19.689
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
Entropy is contagious.

18:24.196 --> 18:26.580
Doug's been very offensive.
He has?

18:26.615 --> 18:28.498
Yes. He has! He has!

18:28.534 --> 18:30.417
Show him, Fish Head.

18:30.452 --> 18:34.204
Okay. Uh, I know women are meant
to be loved and understood,

18:34.206 --> 18:36.873
but, Sarah, your destructive
behavior has plagued...

18:36.875 --> 18:38.842
Oh, really? It's been me?

18:38.877 --> 18:40.293
Don't do that to yourself, girl.

18:40.345 --> 18:41.761
I'm sorry. It's not me.

18:41.797 --> 18:43.179
It's not just me.

18:43.215 --> 18:45.181
That's right. It's not just you.

18:45.217 --> 18:47.801
That makes me very mad.
That makes me very mad, too.

18:47.853 --> 18:49.386
Makes me mad.

18:49.388 --> 18:52.055
I'm sorry that's happening
to you, my darling.

18:52.057 --> 18:54.524
Thank you. What do you think,
Sparkle Cape?

18:54.560 --> 18:56.476
I don't know, Fish Head.
What do you think?

18:56.528 --> 19:00.030
I think that we should
F Doug in the A!

19:00.065 --> 19:01.531
Kelsey.

19:01.567 --> 19:02.983
Oh, hey.

19:03.035 --> 19:04.868
Hey, it's me,
the asshole, remember?

19:04.903 --> 19:06.369
Yeah. I'm sorry.

19:06.405 --> 19:08.321
That was actually kind of
asshole-ish of me.

19:08.373 --> 19:11.074
Yeah, I wasn't even trying to
hit on you before, by the way.

19:11.126 --> 19:13.660
At least I don't think
I was trying to hit on you.

19:13.712 --> 19:15.412
I can't tell anymore.
Hey...

19:15.414 --> 19:17.831
what do you guys do
over here anyway?

19:17.883 --> 19:21.251
Ah, we make magic.

19:21.253 --> 19:23.920
Yeah, sorry. That was an
asshole thing to say.

19:23.922 --> 19:26.339
Do you do any tech consulting?
Yes.

19:26.391 --> 19:27.974
Actually, that's
kind of my thing. Why?

19:28.010 --> 19:29.809
Well, I have an idea for an app,

19:29.845 --> 19:31.478
but these douche bags
are just too busy

19:31.513 --> 19:33.597
spending all the VC
on sushi to even listen.

19:33.599 --> 19:35.231
Oh, lucky for you, I hate sushi,

19:35.267 --> 19:37.150
and I would love
to hear your idea.

19:37.185 --> 19:38.568
What is it?

19:40.856 --> 19:43.573
Okay, um...

19:43.609 --> 19:45.025
It's called "Housecallz."

19:45.077 --> 19:47.277
It's basically Uber,
but with doctors.

19:47.279 --> 19:48.612
With doctors. Yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:48.614 --> 19:51.331
Delivered to your door
on a GPS-based platform.

19:51.366 --> 19:54.250
It's actually kind of
brilliant, Kels.

19:54.286 --> 19:56.169
Thanks, Clyde.

19:56.204 --> 19:57.420
Mm. So, you do
know my name.

19:57.456 --> 20:00.173
Mm...
Kind of know my name.

20:00.208 --> 20:02.008
Now, can you write that code?

20:02.044 --> 20:03.710
'Cause, if so, I can calculate
the optimal price points,

20:03.762 --> 20:05.345
and I can help you get
this off the ground.

20:05.380 --> 20:06.846
That is, if you'll
let me help you.

20:06.882 --> 20:08.598
I've actually already
written that code,

20:08.634 --> 20:10.884
while the brain trust were busy
practicing their backside airs.

20:10.936 --> 20:14.054
Something terrible's gonna
happen in three, two, one.

20:14.106 --> 20:16.723
So, look, I think something
terrible's happened.

20:16.775 --> 20:18.391
I-I was just down
getting my mochaccino,

20:18.443 --> 20:20.560
like I always do--
the special one

20:20.612 --> 20:22.529
with the almond milk...
Finish. I don't care. I don't care.

20:22.564 --> 20:24.114
Right. So, my ATM
card didn't work,

20:24.149 --> 20:25.949
and then my credit
card didn't work.

20:25.984 --> 20:27.784
So, I'm thinking that maybe
there's something wrong with

20:27.819 --> 20:29.903
the magnetic strips, like if my
cell phone, too close to my...

20:29.955 --> 20:31.655
Well, have you maybe
checked your bank account?

20:31.657 --> 20:33.323
After all that rage-texting
you did to your wife last night.

20:33.375 --> 20:34.708
You don't think that maybe...?

20:34.743 --> 20:36.126
What does that mean?
What are you talking about?

20:36.161 --> 20:37.494
Don't be a fucking asshole.
What does that mean?

20:37.496 --> 20:38.878
Don't call me a fucking asshole.

20:38.914 --> 20:40.080
I don't know what
you're talking about.

20:40.132 --> 20:42.298
Did you really
black out last night?

20:42.334 --> 20:43.717
You don't remember the texting at all?
No.

20:43.752 --> 20:45.418
You don't remember the nude stalking?
Hey! Shh!

20:45.470 --> 20:46.886
How do you know about that?

20:46.922 --> 20:48.638
How do you know that?
The lecture on absinthe?

20:48.674 --> 20:50.090
Why don't you check
your text messages?

20:50.142 --> 20:51.975
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no.

20:52.010 --> 20:53.843
Oh, my God. Sarah.

20:54.763 --> 20:56.062
My money!

20:58.650 --> 21:00.517
Excuse me. Sarah!

21:05.357 --> 21:07.991
So...

21:08.026 --> 21:10.360
Yeah.

21:10.362 --> 21:12.362
Where's the part
where you rip me a new one

21:12.364 --> 21:13.780
for blowing the gig?

21:13.832 --> 21:16.533
Ah, you know.

21:18.453 --> 21:21.755
Mm, I don't think I do, Marty.

21:21.790 --> 21:23.757
Well...

21:23.792 --> 21:25.375
You know, since
you're transitioning

21:25.427 --> 21:27.010
out of here anyway...

21:27.045 --> 21:30.180
I mean, I don't see the point
in making a big deal about it.

21:37.639 --> 21:39.606
So, that's it?

21:39.641 --> 21:41.307
Seriously?

21:41.359 --> 21:43.359
Uh, yeah. I mean,
don't... don't do it again.

21:48.233 --> 21:52.402
After I told you that I am
carrying your baby, I'm...

21:52.404 --> 21:55.155
I kind of can't believe
that you have no reaction.

21:56.408 --> 21:58.458
This... This is...

21:58.493 --> 22:00.493
This <i> is</i> my reaction.

22:19.064 --> 22:21.097
Hey, Roscoe.

22:22.184 --> 22:23.483
How was school, buddy?

22:23.518 --> 22:24.901
It was a'ight.

22:24.936 --> 22:26.486
Yeah. A'ight.

22:26.521 --> 22:27.854
How was Seattle?

22:27.906 --> 22:29.489
Oh, it was amazing.

22:29.524 --> 22:32.492
Uh, I had Starbucks on
the Space Needle with Pearl Jam.

22:32.527 --> 22:33.827
Damn, you live the good life.

22:33.862 --> 22:35.278
Holy shit.

22:35.280 --> 22:37.447
It's the hunky Cornell West.

22:37.449 --> 22:39.415
Ah, somebody's been reading
my press.

22:39.451 --> 22:43.036
Oh, somebody just won't
stop sending it to me.

22:43.088 --> 22:44.671
You really
can't miss it.

22:44.706 --> 22:47.423
Well, he's quite
the self-promoter.

22:47.459 --> 22:49.709
So, uh, did you see the
shout-out I gave you last night?

22:49.761 --> 22:51.261
I did.

22:51.296 --> 22:53.963
That was so awesome. You know,
I really loved the part

22:53.965 --> 22:55.799
where you outed my prison time

22:55.801 --> 22:57.550
to millions of people
who had no idea.

22:57.602 --> 22:59.282
It's gonna help the business
so much, Pops.

22:59.304 --> 23:01.805
Whoa. Don't do the crime if you
can't do the time, playboy.

23:01.807 --> 23:04.190
Baretta.
Right.

23:04.226 --> 23:07.944
Anyway, I was just telling Pop
and Roscoe about my sizzle reel

23:07.979 --> 23:09.612
for the show that I'm
pitching to MSNBC.

23:09.648 --> 23:11.364
It's the shit.
Oh.

23:11.399 --> 23:13.650
I'm-I'm sure it's the shit.
Be sure to include

23:13.652 --> 23:16.536
in your sizzle reel
how you exploit your family

23:16.571 --> 23:18.288
for your own personal gain,
'cause that's a crowd pleaser.

23:18.323 --> 23:19.823
You know, maybe...
you know, maybe

23:19.825 --> 23:22.709
if you didn't take the fall
for your baby mama Jeannie.

23:22.744 --> 23:24.127
You remember her, right?

23:24.162 --> 23:25.545
Yeah, maybe things
would have turned out

23:25.580 --> 23:29.549
a little differently, Marty.

23:35.507 --> 23:37.891
I forgot the Parmesan.

23:37.926 --> 23:39.592
I'm gonna...
No, it's okay. It's okay.

23:39.644 --> 23:40.844
We're good.

23:40.846 --> 23:43.263
It's okay.

23:43.315 --> 23:45.398
Why'd you tell him, Dad?

23:45.433 --> 23:46.766
Well, he is your brother, Marty.

23:46.818 --> 23:48.351
Are-are you sure?

23:48.353 --> 23:50.486
Well, shit, I apologize.
I didn't know

23:50.522 --> 23:52.572
that you didn't tell him.
Yeah, you should, Malcolm.

23:52.607 --> 23:54.190
You got a big fucking mouth.
You got a big...

23:54.192 --> 23:55.024
Shut the fuck up, Dad!

23:55.026 --> 23:56.183
Hey.

23:56.303 --> 23:57.911
Stop trying to do
damage control.

23:57.946 --> 23:59.329
The damage is done.

23:59.364 --> 24:01.664
Congratulations.
Okay, I mean,

24:01.700 --> 24:03.783
your narcissism wins again.
Okay, okay.

24:03.835 --> 24:05.835
I mean, it's bigger than all of us, Dad.
Listen, listen.

24:05.871 --> 24:07.620
I was trying to find
the right time to tell you.

24:07.672 --> 24:09.289
I didn't want it
to just get blurted out.

24:09.341 --> 24:11.758
Dad, you don't get to control
how the world happens

24:11.793 --> 24:13.676
for me anymore.
You don't get to just

24:13.712 --> 24:16.596
set down all the land mines
and decide when I step on them.

24:16.631 --> 24:19.382
Look, little man, Uncle Malcolm
would never just...

24:19.384 --> 24:21.384
I'm not your little man,
Malcolm.

24:21.386 --> 24:24.304
You're a crappy uncle, okay,
and, Dad, you know,

24:24.356 --> 24:26.272
I love Jeannie, I do.

24:26.308 --> 24:28.441
I probably would have been super
happy about this whole thing

24:28.476 --> 24:30.443
if you would have had
the balls to tell me.

24:30.478 --> 24:32.028
Roscoe, we really were

24:32.063 --> 24:33.279
starting to tell you...
Shut up, Grandpa.

24:33.315 --> 24:34.864
Hey! Hey!

24:34.900 --> 24:36.482
I mean, I can't believe you knew

24:36.534 --> 24:39.202
about this information,
and you still didn't...

24:39.237 --> 24:40.987
You know, forget it.

24:41.039 --> 24:43.623
You guys are a bunch
of fucking cowards.

24:43.658 --> 24:46.159
You better...
Okay, sit down.

24:46.211 --> 24:47.994
Sit down. Sit down.

24:48.046 --> 24:51.464
I'm not sitting down.
I said sit down!

24:51.499 --> 24:55.134
Now, no. No.

24:55.170 --> 24:59.472
You don't get to take your
family down like this.

24:59.507 --> 25:02.425
We've all been through
some tough times.

25:02.427 --> 25:05.144
All of us.

25:05.180 --> 25:07.347
But that's what family
is, that's what this is,

25:07.399 --> 25:10.683
and sometimes, it's
a fucking disaster.

25:14.439 --> 25:18.157
But we go through that
fucking disaster together.

25:18.193 --> 25:20.276
That's what family is.

25:20.278 --> 25:23.947
And you don't ever get...

25:23.999 --> 25:26.416
to tell me to shut up.

25:28.536 --> 25:31.287
Do you understand me?

25:31.289 --> 25:33.673
Yes, sir.

25:38.096 --> 25:40.880
Roscoe?

25:40.932 --> 25:42.598
Roscoe!
Forget it!

25:42.634 --> 25:44.133
Pop, Pop, Pop, Pop.

25:44.185 --> 25:45.468
What?

25:45.470 --> 25:47.603
Let him go.

25:48.640 --> 25:50.390
What?

25:52.610 --> 25:54.610
Sarah?!

25:55.647 --> 25:57.647
Sarah?

26:00.068 --> 26:02.652
Ugh.

26:02.654 --> 26:04.487
Oh, God.

26:05.740 --> 26:08.074
Oh, my God.

26:08.126 --> 26:10.827
Shit. Oh, shit.

26:10.829 --> 26:12.996
She broke the seal.

26:12.998 --> 26:14.998
Oh...

26:17.335 --> 26:19.502
Oh. Oh, God.

26:19.504 --> 26:21.304
She broke the seal.

26:44.913 --> 26:49.615
? This is a song
about somebody else ?

26:49.667 --> 26:53.836
? So don't worry yourself,
worry yourself ?

26:55.874 --> 27:00.376
? The devil's right there,
right there in the details ?

27:00.428 --> 27:04.881
? And you don't want to
hurt yourself, hurt yourself ?

27:06.885 --> 27:09.218
? By looking too closely ?

27:12.307 --> 27:14.640
? By looking too closely ?

27:16.811 --> 27:19.278
? No, no, no, no ?

27:39.918 --> 27:43.820
? And I could be wrong
about anybody else ?
