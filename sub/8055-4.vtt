WEBVTT

00:00.741 --> 00:01.815
Ron?

00:02.076 --> 00:03.675
Jack Cooper, from the controller's office.

00:03.795 --> 00:04.962
Got a...got a second?

00:05.030 --> 00:06.481
Sure, what can I do you for?

00:06.564 --> 00:07.899
Frankly, this is
a little awkward.

00:07.966 --> 00:10.501
We've received this letter
from a collection agency

00:10.568 --> 00:11.836
about an outstanding debt

00:11.904 --> 00:13.971
from the Pawnee Public Library.

00:14.039 --> 00:15.206
It appears
you have an overdue book.

00:15.274 --> 00:16.607
Oh, do I?

00:16.675 --> 00:18.709
<i>It's Not the Size of the Boat:</i>

00:18.777 --> 00:22.713
<i>Embracing Life with a Micro-Penis.</i>

00:22.781 --> 00:24.415
Tammy.

00:24.483 --> 00:26.417
My ex-wife Tammy
likes to check in

00:26.468 --> 00:28.319
every so often and make sure

00:28.387 --> 00:29.821
I'm doing okay.

00:29.888 --> 00:33.691
And if I am, she tries
to [bleep] everything up.

00:33.759 --> 00:35.626
Okay, I pre-dialed 911,
so all you have to do

00:35.694 --> 00:36.694
is press send.

00:36.762 --> 00:38.129
You're worrying over nothing.

00:38.197 --> 00:39.764
If she binds your hands
and you can't reach your phone,

00:39.815 --> 00:41.566
just try to chew yourself free.

00:44.436 --> 00:45.970
Whale tale.
Whale tale.

00:46.038 --> 00:48.039
She's flashing a whale tale.
Abort. Abort.

00:48.107 --> 00:49.991
Hello, Tammy.

00:50.075 --> 00:52.176
Oh.
Hello, Ron.

00:52.244 --> 00:53.978
I didn't see you come in.

00:54.029 --> 00:56.013
I was just checking myself
for scoliosis.

00:56.081 --> 00:58.332
- And?
- Straight as an arrow.

00:58.400 --> 01:00.952
Just like somebody else I know.

01:01.019 --> 01:01.986
Jerky?

01:02.054 --> 01:03.888
Call off the dogs.

01:03.956 --> 01:05.355
You and I both know

01:05.424 --> 01:07.158
that in my entire adult life,

01:07.226 --> 01:10.695
I have never checked
a book out of the library.

01:10.762 --> 01:13.047
Oh, my God, she's amazing.

01:13.132 --> 01:16.017
Ooh...
Mmm.

01:16.101 --> 01:18.402
I admit there was a time
when that sort of behavior

01:18.470 --> 01:20.521
would've driven me wild.

01:20.606 --> 01:23.541
But I am in a healthy
relationship now, Tammy.

01:23.609 --> 01:26.477
A relationship?
With whom?

01:26.545 --> 01:28.579
A lovely, intelligent,
self-possessed

01:28.647 --> 01:29.947
pediatric surgeon named Wendy.

01:30.015 --> 01:32.450
Sounds like a real whore.

01:32.518 --> 01:34.852
Clear the late charges
and cut the crap.

01:34.920 --> 01:38.055
Good day.

01:38.123 --> 01:39.524
Good day, Leslie.

01:39.591 --> 01:42.410
Good... good day.

01:45.497 --> 01:55.421
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

02:02.548 --> 02:03.748
Okay, so we're ordering them

02:03.815 --> 02:06.601
a total of 30 pizzas
so let's talk toppings.

02:06.685 --> 02:08.085
Sausage, onion, and peppers.

02:08.152 --> 02:10.321
Scientifically proven
to be the best toppings.

02:10.388 --> 02:11.606
Nice.

02:11.690 --> 02:13.224
Should we throw in some salads

02:13.292 --> 02:14.892
for a healthy option?

02:14.943 --> 02:17.495
Wow, don't be such a Jerry, Ben.

02:17.563 --> 02:19.430
Yeah, Ben, these guys
are cops, not ballerinas.

02:19.498 --> 02:21.098
So we are throwing
a little shindig

02:21.166 --> 02:23.434
for the police department
because we're asking them

02:23.502 --> 02:26.070
to volunteer as security
during the harvest festival.

02:26.121 --> 02:28.756
I don't know what it is
about big outdoor gatherings

02:28.840 --> 02:31.442
that makes everyone
want to urinate

02:31.510 --> 02:35.446
all over everything, but it does.

02:35.514 --> 02:36.948
And they do.

02:37.015 --> 02:40.101
Okay, how about some calzones?

02:40.185 --> 02:41.919
Calzones are like pizzas
but they're harder to eat.

02:41.987 --> 02:44.655
They're dumb
and so was that idea.

02:44.723 --> 02:47.992
- Seriously?
- This is embarrassing for you.

02:48.060 --> 02:50.194
Sorry to interrupt.
Ron, you ready?

02:50.262 --> 02:51.629
Absolutely, my dear.

02:51.697 --> 02:53.598
I am off to have
a mid-morning pre-lunch

02:53.665 --> 02:55.066
with my lady friend,

02:55.117 --> 02:56.817
but I will be back
in time for lunch.

02:56.902 --> 02:59.303
All right.

02:59.371 --> 03:00.638
Oh, Ron's girlfriend's pretty.

03:03.942 --> 03:05.293
Tom's ex-wife.

03:05.377 --> 03:08.045
Oh.

03:08.113 --> 03:09.330
I don't want to
see them together.

03:09.414 --> 03:10.715
It's like they're
rubbing it in my face.

03:10.782 --> 03:13.184
So all I can think about
is Captain Mustache

03:13.252 --> 03:14.452
plowing my ex-wife.

03:14.519 --> 03:15.586
And you imagine
he's wearing a cape

03:15.654 --> 03:17.138
while he's plowing her?

03:17.222 --> 03:18.522
What?

03:18.590 --> 03:20.007
No, just, Captain Mustache?

03:20.092 --> 03:22.059
I mean, if all you can think of
is Ron, you know......

03:22.127 --> 03:23.728
Maybe put him in some tights
and a cape

03:23.795 --> 03:25.096
and then... and then
it would be funny.

03:25.163 --> 03:29.466
Now, I'm imagining a cape.

03:29.518 --> 03:30.668
April?

03:30.736 --> 03:33.671
Did you call me?

03:33.739 --> 03:35.306
I did call you.
Good ears.

03:35.357 --> 03:39.010
Chris's assistant
went back to Indianapolis,

03:39.077 --> 03:42.480
so he's borrowing me
for a few days.

03:42.547 --> 03:44.015
Yay.

03:44.082 --> 03:45.650
I'd like you to get me
some more post-its.

03:45.717 --> 03:47.285
I'd like them in multiple colors.

03:47.336 --> 03:48.719
I'd like green.
I'd like yellow.

03:48.787 --> 03:50.688
Do not buy orange.

03:50.756 --> 03:52.657
I do not want orange.
I have plenty of orange.

03:52.724 --> 03:53.991
Got it.

03:54.042 --> 03:55.893
You want five million
orange post-its.

03:55.961 --> 03:58.879
That's hilarious.

03:58.964 --> 04:04.501
Oh, wait!
I have a post-it for you.

04:04.553 --> 04:07.138
- It says, "great job."
- Mmm.

04:07.205 --> 04:08.773
- Great job!
- Mmm.

04:08.840 --> 04:10.808
There you go.

04:13.779 --> 04:17.081
They're getting really old
and I'm an only child.

04:17.149 --> 04:19.183
I just feel like
the right thing to do

04:19.250 --> 04:22.386
is to move back home.

04:22.454 --> 04:24.755
I'm sorry to see you go.

04:24.823 --> 04:30.027
I've really come to think
of you as...

04:30.095 --> 04:33.497
A companion.

04:33.565 --> 04:38.002
Hey, I don't suppose
you'd want to move to Canada?

04:41.139 --> 04:43.474
Canada.

04:43.542 --> 04:47.094
No, I don't suppose I would.

04:47.179 --> 04:49.113
Hey, I hate to nag,

04:49.181 --> 04:50.598
but shouldn't
we be talking strategy,

04:50.682 --> 04:54.685
like, when to ask the chief
for this huge critical favor?

04:54.736 --> 04:56.553
Yes. I know exactly
when we should do it.

04:56.605 --> 04:58.489
Post pizza, pre ice cream,

04:58.557 --> 04:59.890
between his third
and fourth beer.

04:59.941 --> 05:01.859
He'll be full but not stuffed,
tipsy but not drunk.

05:01.910 --> 05:03.060
Should be around 9:00.

05:03.111 --> 05:05.296
Okay, so you've
thought this through.

05:05.364 --> 05:08.833
Just sit tight.
I'll get you a beer.

05:08.900 --> 05:11.786
Can I have two beers please?

05:11.870 --> 05:13.087
Hey, you okay?

05:13.171 --> 05:15.072
Wendy and I are over.

05:15.140 --> 05:16.907
She's moving back to Canada.

05:16.975 --> 05:18.742
It's too bad.

05:18.794 --> 05:21.379
I just taught her how to whittle.

05:21.430 --> 05:24.799
She made me this
tiny sharpened stick.

05:24.883 --> 05:27.551
Look, I'm gonna tell you
what I tell all my girlfriends

05:27.619 --> 05:29.487
when they get dumped.

05:29.554 --> 05:31.055
Men are dogs.

05:31.123 --> 05:32.973
Thank you, Leslie.

05:33.058 --> 05:35.893
That does not apply
to this situation at all.

05:35.944 --> 05:38.262
But thank you.
I appreciate it.

05:38.313 --> 05:39.997
This is a disaster.

05:40.065 --> 05:42.666
You're not into football?

05:42.734 --> 05:45.269
I knew there was something
wrong with you.

05:45.320 --> 05:47.605
I knew it.
I knew it, knew it, knew it.

05:47.672 --> 05:49.990
Honestly, I haven't felt
this good in years.

05:50.075 --> 05:51.826
And it's not just because
of the supplements

05:51.910 --> 05:53.994
he has me taking
and the soluble fiber

05:54.079 --> 05:55.446
and the increase in regularity.

05:55.497 --> 05:56.747
It's him.

05:56.815 --> 05:58.816
He's, uh, moving back
to Indianapolis

05:58.884 --> 06:01.285
in a couple of weeks,
which sucks.

06:01.336 --> 06:03.788
But if he asked me
to move with him,

06:03.855 --> 06:06.290
I think I would.

06:06.358 --> 06:07.691
I would like a local beer.

06:07.759 --> 06:09.510
I'd like it in a bottle.

06:09.594 --> 06:11.095
I'd like the bottle to be cold.

06:11.163 --> 06:13.013
I would like
a glass of white wine.

06:13.098 --> 06:14.682
I would like it to be chardonnay.

06:14.766 --> 06:16.467
And I would like that
with one ice cube.

06:16.518 --> 06:18.969
Thanks.

06:19.037 --> 06:21.405
- Chief Trumple?
- Hey, Knope.

06:21.473 --> 06:24.325
You know Ben Wyatt
from the State Budget Office.

06:24.409 --> 06:25.543
- Yeah, how's it going?
- Hello.

06:25.610 --> 06:27.027
Thanks for the party.
Good pizza.

06:27.112 --> 06:30.197
Great. So, yeah, the pizza's
dynamite, isn't it?

06:30.282 --> 06:32.049
I just said it was good pizza.

06:32.117 --> 06:34.718
It's good.
Pizza's good.

06:34.786 --> 06:38.622
You, uh, you know what I like?

06:38.690 --> 06:40.458
Calzones.

06:40.509 --> 06:42.326
What the hell
is wrong with this guy?

06:42.394 --> 06:44.011
It's all right.
We'll check in with you later.

06:44.095 --> 06:45.796
- Take it easy.
- Yeah, will do.

06:45.847 --> 06:46.931
What is wrong with you?

06:46.998 --> 06:48.015
I was getting somewhere
with that.

06:48.099 --> 06:49.183
Yeah, great small talk
over there.

06:49.267 --> 06:50.234
Okay, let me handle this.

06:50.302 --> 06:51.352
I get a little nervous with cops.

06:51.436 --> 06:54.638
- I'm in control.
- What's up?

06:54.706 --> 06:56.524
Tom Haverford's in the building.

06:56.608 --> 06:57.741
Whoo!

06:57.809 --> 06:59.843
Tom, what the hell are you doing?

06:59.895 --> 07:02.146
Same thing you're doing,
celebrating Pawnee's finest.

07:02.214 --> 07:04.148
I believe you know
my date, Tammy Swanson.

07:04.216 --> 07:05.149
Hiya, Ron.

07:05.217 --> 07:07.401
- Oh. Hiya, Ron.
- Hey, Ron.

07:07.486 --> 07:08.752
I'm sorry.

07:08.820 --> 07:11.322
Is seeing your ex-wife
on my arm

07:11.389 --> 07:12.490
making you uncomfortable?

07:12.557 --> 07:15.593
Gee, I can't imagine why.
Or can I?

07:15.660 --> 07:17.912
Ooh, I like this song.
Do you wanna dance, Tammy?

07:17.996 --> 07:18.996
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

07:19.047 --> 07:21.415
Ooh. Uh.

07:21.500 --> 07:23.834
I know Tammy seems scary.

07:23.885 --> 07:26.170
But really, she's just
a manipulative, psychotic,

07:26.238 --> 07:29.073
library-book-pedaling,
sex-crazed she-demon.

07:32.968 --> 07:34.702
- I think that's enough.
- Tammy.

07:34.770 --> 07:36.871
Uh. Oh, hi, Ron.

07:36.922 --> 07:39.090
I was just tasting
my new boyfriend, Glenn.

07:39.174 --> 07:40.425
Tom.

07:40.509 --> 07:41.776
You don't know
what you're mixed up in, son.

07:41.844 --> 07:44.078
This isn't about you.
It's about me.

07:44.146 --> 07:46.931
Typical Ron Swanson.
Always thinking about yourself.

07:47.016 --> 07:49.717
- Maybe we like each other.
- Yeah, maybe we do.

07:49.768 --> 07:51.986
Ah-eey! Okay.

07:52.054 --> 07:53.271
Let's take it easy.

07:53.355 --> 07:55.723
Tammy, leave him out of this.

07:55.791 --> 07:57.291
Oh, so it's okay for you
to have a girlfriend,

07:57.359 --> 07:58.726
but I'm not supposed
to see anybody?

07:58.777 --> 08:00.094
Damn it, woman.

08:00.162 --> 08:02.096
Just crawl back in to
the dank hole you came from

08:02.164 --> 08:03.564
and leave my friends alone.

08:03.615 --> 08:04.866
Oh! Okay, okay.
Let's settle down.

08:04.933 --> 08:06.284
What seems to be the problem?

08:06.368 --> 08:07.802
- What seems to be the problem?
- Is there a problem here?

08:07.870 --> 08:10.271
Basically what we had here was
a dispute of a domestic nature.

08:10.339 --> 08:13.041
- White male, 40, 45.
- Caucasian male.

08:13.092 --> 08:15.476
- Stocky build.
- Approximately 5'10".

08:15.544 --> 08:18.146
Verbal altercation transpired
at approximately 8:55 P.M.

08:18.213 --> 08:19.414
with a female unsub.

08:19.481 --> 08:21.082
Appears to be slightly
intoxicated.

08:21.133 --> 08:22.784
Claims to be an ex-spouse.

08:22.851 --> 08:24.419
Real piece of work.

08:24.486 --> 08:25.920
- Real piece of work.
- Real piece of work.

08:25.988 --> 08:27.488
Real piece of work.

08:27.556 --> 08:28.923
I know why you're doing this,

08:28.974 --> 08:30.141
and you're making a huge mistake.

08:30.225 --> 08:31.592
Fight fire with fire, Leslie.

08:31.660 --> 08:33.027
He dates my ex, I date his.

08:33.095 --> 08:34.761
Ron and Wendy aren't
even dating anymore.

08:34.813 --> 08:36.614
She's moving back to Canada.

08:36.698 --> 08:38.482
- What?
- Uh-oh. Oh, God.

08:38.567 --> 08:39.984
Okay, hey.
What's happening here?

08:40.068 --> 08:42.370
Ron and I are going
to get a cup of coffee

08:42.437 --> 08:43.371
and talk things out.

08:43.438 --> 08:44.956
It's time for Tammy and me

08:45.040 --> 08:48.042
to bury the hatchet
once and for all.

08:48.110 --> 08:51.112
Everything will be fine.

08:56.085 --> 08:59.337
It's been like this for hours.

08:59.421 --> 09:00.555
Right there.
Right there.

09:00.622 --> 09:02.323
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Hey, Swanson!

09:04.126 --> 09:05.893
Snap out of it!

09:05.961 --> 09:07.461
Leslie.

09:07.513 --> 09:08.796
Congratulate us.

09:08.847 --> 09:12.400
Ron's got one
just like it on his penis.

09:12.467 --> 09:14.301
Oh, yeah.

09:14.353 --> 09:16.070
What the hell happened to you?

09:16.138 --> 09:18.406
Well...

09:20.000 --> 09:26.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:28.083 --> 09:29.200
Thank you.

09:30.986 --> 09:33.538
Rock and roll!
Yeah, baby!

09:33.622 --> 09:34.839
- I got it!
- Uh!

09:34.923 --> 09:36.174
You may now kiss the bride.

09:39.261 --> 09:46.551
♪ ♪

09:46.635 --> 09:49.053
It's been kind of a crazy night.

09:49.138 --> 09:50.354
Come back, come back.

09:52.307 --> 09:54.892
April, could you
come in here a second?

09:54.977 --> 09:57.378
April, way to come in.
Great initiative.

09:57.446 --> 09:59.346
You called me in.

09:59.398 --> 10:01.048
Listen, could you please
call Ann Perkins

10:01.116 --> 10:02.900
and tell her that I will be
unable to enjoy lunch

10:02.985 --> 10:05.253
with her today,
as I am just swamped.

10:05.320 --> 10:06.287
All day.

10:06.354 --> 10:08.856
Copy that.

10:08.907 --> 10:11.192
Hi, Ann.
This is April.

10:11.243 --> 10:12.860
I'm just calling to let you know

10:12.928 --> 10:14.879
that Chris can't
make lunch today.

10:14.963 --> 10:18.749
I knew you wouldn't care.
Good-bye.

10:18.834 --> 10:20.334
They started having sex
at the court house.

10:20.402 --> 10:21.636
We had no choice.

10:21.703 --> 10:23.604
Oh, well,
I completely understand.

10:23.672 --> 10:25.873
Chief, I need to ask you
a huge favor.

10:25.924 --> 10:27.141
Leslie.

10:27.209 --> 10:28.759
Ron is a good man

10:28.844 --> 10:30.311
who just got caught up
in something terrible.

10:30.378 --> 10:32.814
And I was hoping that maybe
you would

10:32.881 --> 10:36.450
reduce his charges and
release him into my custody.

10:36.518 --> 10:37.902
All right.

10:37.986 --> 10:40.154
But keep him away
from that crazy librarian.

10:40.222 --> 10:41.823
I'll do my best.

10:41.890 --> 10:42.940
In fact, I don't want him

10:43.025 --> 10:45.092
within 500 feet of the library.

10:45.160 --> 10:46.661
That's good advice for all of us.

10:46.728 --> 10:47.912
Nothing but trouble there.

10:47.996 --> 10:50.631
- Thanks a lot, bro.
- Hey, stop.

10:50.699 --> 10:52.617
Sorry.

10:52.701 --> 10:55.453
Take me back to Tammy.

10:55.537 --> 10:57.171
For the millionth time, no.

10:57.239 --> 10:59.423
That was not the favor
we needed to ask for, Leslie.

10:59.508 --> 11:01.509
If we don't get the police
for the harvest festival,

11:01.576 --> 11:03.344
there is no harvest festival.

11:03.411 --> 11:04.962
I know.
I'll figure it out later.

11:05.047 --> 11:07.932
Can you turn the radio off.
This is our song.

11:08.016 --> 11:09.750
Your song is
<i>Dancing on the Ceiling</i>

11:09.801 --> 11:11.769
by Lionel Ritchie?

11:11.854 --> 11:13.354
Oh, wow, look at that.

11:13.421 --> 11:14.555
You shaved off
part of your mustache.

11:14.623 --> 11:15.656
That's lovely.

11:15.724 --> 11:19.193
I didn't shave it off.
It rubbed off...

11:19.261 --> 11:20.561
From friction.

11:20.629 --> 11:21.696
Uhh!

11:21.763 --> 11:23.064
Uhhh!

11:23.115 --> 11:24.148
Uhh!

11:24.233 --> 11:26.267
Ron Swanson,
this is an intervention.

11:26.318 --> 11:28.502
You have been spending
the last 24 hours

11:28.570 --> 11:31.572
sipping on joy juice
and tripping on Tammy.

11:31.640 --> 11:33.824
Well, the people in this room
are your methadone.

11:33.909 --> 11:35.493
And we're here to get you clean.

11:35.577 --> 11:37.962
Congratulations.

11:38.046 --> 11:41.332
Holy matrimony,
there's the man of the hour.

11:41.416 --> 11:43.467
Jerry, what is this?

11:43.552 --> 11:44.585
That is the set of tumblers

11:44.653 --> 11:46.153
that I got from the registry.

11:46.221 --> 11:47.989
This is an intervention.

11:48.056 --> 11:49.307
I thought you said on the phone

11:49.391 --> 11:50.558
it was a reception.

11:50.626 --> 11:52.627
Okay.
All right, let's begin.

11:52.694 --> 11:55.513
I would like to address
the goofy-looking,

11:55.597 --> 11:58.666
dirty-kimono-wearing,
corn-rowed clown in the room.

11:58.734 --> 12:03.271
If you see Ron Swanson,
can you give him this message?

12:03.322 --> 12:05.539
You used to be a man.

12:05.607 --> 12:07.642
You need to get
your house in order.

12:07.709 --> 12:09.610
Look, I love you like a brother

12:09.678 --> 12:11.779
but right now, I hate you

12:11.830 --> 12:13.681
like my actual brother,
Levondrious,

12:13.749 --> 12:15.983
who I hate.

12:16.051 --> 12:17.001
Okay, Tom.

12:17.085 --> 12:18.986
Ron, you look great.

12:19.037 --> 12:21.255
Your skin is glowing.
I've never seen you so happy.

12:21.323 --> 12:23.257
Okay, sit down.

12:23.325 --> 12:25.492
Andy.

12:25.544 --> 12:28.596
Ron, I do not really understand

12:28.664 --> 12:30.598
what is going on right now.

12:30.666 --> 12:35.853
But no matter what,

12:35.938 --> 12:38.372
you must keep going.

12:38.440 --> 12:39.707
No.

12:39.775 --> 12:42.510
You must stop.

12:42.577 --> 12:44.478
I love you, buddy.

12:44.546 --> 12:47.581
Follow your dreams.

12:47.649 --> 12:49.383
Powerful stuff.

12:51.286 --> 12:54.521
April?
What are you doing here?

12:54.573 --> 12:57.591
I work for your boyfriend.
What are you doing here?

12:57.659 --> 13:00.027
I came to see why Chris
stood me up for lunch,

13:00.078 --> 13:01.462
but I think I just
figured it out.

13:01.513 --> 13:02.680
Because he doesn't like you.

13:02.764 --> 13:04.231
No, I'm pretty sure
that's not it.

13:04.299 --> 13:07.234
Actually it's because
I didn't call you deliberately.

13:07.302 --> 13:09.737
Which, if you ask me,
is a fireable offense.

13:09.804 --> 13:11.339
So I would tell him that.

13:11.406 --> 13:13.975
Also, he's not into you sexually.

13:14.042 --> 13:15.776
- Mmm.
- Ann Perkins.

13:15.827 --> 13:16.994
April Ludgate.

13:17.079 --> 13:19.246
Literally two of
my favorite people on earth.

13:19.314 --> 13:20.648
I'm sorry that I had
to cancel lunch.

13:20.716 --> 13:22.983
Not at all.
It's not a problem.

13:23.035 --> 13:25.853
April here was very
apologetic on the phone.

13:25.921 --> 13:27.288
She also sent me flowers.

13:27.339 --> 13:30.091
April.
Nice touch.

13:33.662 --> 13:36.130
Hello, Ron.
It's Ron.

13:36.198 --> 13:39.767
If you're watching this,
it means that once again

13:39.835 --> 13:41.669
you have danced with the devil.

13:41.737 --> 13:43.637
Right now,
you're probably thinking

13:43.705 --> 13:45.406
Tammy's changed.

13:45.474 --> 13:47.008
We'll be happy together.

13:47.075 --> 13:48.442
But you're only thinking that

13:48.510 --> 13:50.644
because she's
a monstrous parasite

13:50.712 --> 13:52.930
who entered through your privates

13:53.015 --> 13:55.316
and lodged herself in your brain.

13:55.384 --> 13:57.234
So you have two choices...

13:57.319 --> 13:59.553
One, get rid of Tammy,

13:59.604 --> 14:02.990
or two, lobotomy and castration.

14:03.058 --> 14:04.859
Choose wisely.

14:04.926 --> 14:07.795
You stupid.

14:07.863 --> 14:10.164
This is a waste of time.

14:10.231 --> 14:13.567
You people have no idea
what you're talking about.

14:13.635 --> 14:16.937
That was you on the tape.
That was you talking.

14:17.005 --> 14:18.706
Ron? Ron!

14:18.757 --> 14:21.876
Ron.
Oh, there you are.

14:21.927 --> 14:25.012
Ah!

14:25.080 --> 14:27.515
Ron. Stop it.
God, please.

14:27.582 --> 14:31.135
- Ron, don't do that.
- Oh, it's done, Leslie.

14:31.219 --> 14:32.820
Tammy and I are in love,

14:32.888 --> 14:34.922
and we're gonna start a family
together.

14:34.973 --> 14:37.191
In fact, she's ovulating.

14:37.259 --> 14:38.726
So if you'll excuse us,

14:38.777 --> 14:40.561
we're heading off
on our honeymoon.

14:40.629 --> 14:43.998
- Wow. Where are you going?
- Jerry.

14:44.066 --> 14:46.801
We're gonna spend 11 days
in my cabin in the woods.

14:46.868 --> 14:48.736
We bought 10 cases of Gatorade

14:48.804 --> 14:51.539
and a 40-pound bag
of peanuts for energy.

14:51.606 --> 14:54.458
- Oh, God.
- Give me it.

14:54.543 --> 14:58.112
All right, okay.
Excuse me.

14:58.163 --> 15:00.114
Oh, yeah.
Oh, God.

15:01.415 --> 15:02.969
Ann and I are headed out

15:03.089 --> 15:04.423
and I just wanted to thank you

15:04.490 --> 15:06.675
for everything today,
and I will see you tomorrow.

15:08.356 --> 15:10.190
Hi, Chris.

15:10.258 --> 15:12.558
Uh, Ron Swanson has sent me over

15:12.610 --> 15:15.328
to deliver to you this document.

15:15.396 --> 15:18.598
"To whom it may concern,
dear Chris,

15:18.666 --> 15:21.401
"there is an emergency regarding
the Parks Department,

15:21.469 --> 15:24.404
"and April may just be
the only person who can help.

15:24.472 --> 15:28.275
"I can't get into details
because it's super-classified.

15:28.342 --> 15:30.443
"Please release April
back to us permanently.

15:30.511 --> 15:32.312
"God bless America.

15:32.380 --> 15:36.416
Love, Bert Macklin, FBI."

15:36.484 --> 15:37.517
What?

15:37.584 --> 15:39.219
Okay. Well, bye.

15:39.270 --> 15:40.753
April, listen.

15:40.805 --> 15:42.589
If you don't want to work for me,

15:42.657 --> 15:43.823
I'm not gonna force you.

15:43.891 --> 15:45.091
You didn't have to do this.

15:45.142 --> 15:46.426
She didn't do that.
That... that was...

15:46.494 --> 15:48.194
Dude, I think it sounds
like it was Macklin's call.

15:48.262 --> 15:49.429
Look, I get it.

15:49.497 --> 15:52.899
You're young,
and trying isn't cool.

15:52.967 --> 15:54.334
But I think you're smart.

15:54.402 --> 15:57.070
I'm gonna be going back
to Indianapolis soon,

15:57.121 --> 15:59.539
and I think you should
come work for me.

15:59.606 --> 16:02.342
Wow, move all the way
to Indianapolis,

16:02.410 --> 16:05.145
so I can pick up your
vitamins and supplements.

16:05.212 --> 16:07.080
Everybody starts somewhere.

16:07.131 --> 16:08.315
You'll travel,

16:08.382 --> 16:10.684
and you will meet
interesting people.

16:10.751 --> 16:12.585
Think about it.

16:12.653 --> 16:15.855
Okay. I will.

16:15.923 --> 16:17.757
Apparently he wants April

16:17.825 --> 16:20.760
to move to Indianapolis with him.

16:20.811 --> 16:23.229
So that's something.

16:25.966 --> 16:27.367
I hope you're happy.

16:27.435 --> 16:30.737
Look, I just wanted to
show him what it felt like

16:30.804 --> 16:33.239
to have your ex-wife
date someone you know.

16:33.307 --> 16:35.775
Whatever happened after that
is not my fault.

16:35.826 --> 16:36.860
Yes, it is.

16:36.944 --> 16:39.162
Tom, you did
a really crappy thing,

16:39.246 --> 16:41.448
and I think deep down,
you know that.

16:41.515 --> 16:45.618
Whatever happens
to Ron Swanson is on you.

16:51.559 --> 16:53.793
Excuse me, chief.
Sorry to interrupt.

16:53.844 --> 16:55.762
Hey, calzone boy, what's up?

16:55.830 --> 16:58.831
Well, here's hoping that
that nickname doesn't stick.

16:58.883 --> 17:01.601
Right?

17:01.668 --> 17:03.636
But that's not why I'm here.

17:03.704 --> 17:07.540
Uh, Leslie Knope asked you
for a favor the other day,

17:07.608 --> 17:09.541
but the real favor we need
is much bigger.

17:09.609 --> 17:12.145
You mean,
like calzone-sized?

17:12.195 --> 17:15.415
Ah! Sure.

17:15.483 --> 17:17.483
We need the Pawnee police force

17:17.550 --> 17:18.752
to volunteer as security

17:18.819 --> 17:20.853
during the upcoming
harvest festival.

17:20.905 --> 17:22.989
Now, the city won't let us
throw the festival unless...

17:23.040 --> 17:24.590
Say no more.

17:24.657 --> 17:26.393
Just send me a schedule of how
many officers you need and when.

17:26.460 --> 17:28.762
Really?
Just like that?

17:28.829 --> 17:31.131
Leslie Knope gets
as many favors as she needs.

17:31.198 --> 17:33.066
Can I ask why?

17:33.134 --> 17:35.385
Because she's
the kind of a person

17:35.469 --> 17:37.237
who uses favors
to help other people.

17:37.304 --> 17:39.172
And also, my buddy Dave

17:39.223 --> 17:40.607
was the crankiest bastard
in the department

17:40.674 --> 17:41.975
till he started dating Leslie.

17:42.042 --> 17:45.711
Huh. So she...
Okay.

17:45.763 --> 17:47.547
Are they still dating or...?

17:47.615 --> 17:50.583
No. Moved to San Diego
a year ago.

17:50.651 --> 17:52.485
Oh.

17:52.553 --> 17:54.487
Was it a serious thing, or...?

17:54.555 --> 17:56.656
What do you care?
You a pervert?

17:56.724 --> 17:58.091
Nope, nope.
I'm all good.

17:58.159 --> 17:59.692
Um, everything's fine.

17:59.744 --> 18:01.694
This is fine.

18:03.397 --> 18:04.564
Don't think I won't do it.

18:04.632 --> 18:05.598
I'll wear this to work.

18:07.501 --> 18:09.068
All right, we got a little one.

18:09.120 --> 18:10.920
Ooh, what's in here, huh?

18:11.005 --> 18:13.590
A new library card?

18:13.674 --> 18:14.841
Read the name.

18:14.908 --> 18:16.342
"Tammy Swanson Swanson."

18:17.411 --> 18:19.679
You guys, that's amazing.

18:21.849 --> 18:23.767
Well, you about ready
to go, my love?

18:23.851 --> 18:25.251
- Yeah.
- Wait, Ron!

18:25.302 --> 18:26.419
Stop!

18:26.487 --> 18:28.354
Jerry, what the hell?

18:28.422 --> 18:30.756
Don't do it.
She doesn't love you.

18:30.808 --> 18:32.642
You don't know what
you're talking about.

18:32.726 --> 18:33.693
What are you doing here?

18:33.760 --> 18:35.929
Yes, I do, okay?

18:35.996 --> 18:36.946
When I asked her to be my date,

18:37.031 --> 18:38.064
she cackled for a full minute

18:38.115 --> 18:40.667
and said, and I quote,

18:40.734 --> 18:43.570
"anything to make Ron
miserable."

18:43.621 --> 18:45.605
It's not real, man.

18:45.656 --> 18:46.790
She's just messing with you.

18:46.874 --> 18:49.542
He's lying, Ron.
Stay out of this, Glenn.

18:49.610 --> 18:51.478
It's Tom.
And I'm not lying.

18:51.545 --> 18:52.996
I'm not gonna let you
destroy Ron.

18:53.080 --> 18:54.664
You're just gonna
have to... Ow!

18:54.748 --> 18:56.382
Ow! Aah!

18:56.450 --> 18:58.485
Oh!
He's attacking me, Ron!

18:58.552 --> 19:00.587
Kill him!

19:08.095 --> 19:11.064
Yeah!
Do your worst, Glenn!

19:11.131 --> 19:12.098
You're gonna have to do
better than that.

19:12.149 --> 19:13.533
- Aaaah!
- Aah!

19:15.536 --> 19:16.820
Why are you
hitting yourself, Glenn?

19:16.904 --> 19:18.354
Stop hitting yourself.

19:18.439 --> 19:20.406
Tammy, that's enough!

19:20.474 --> 19:21.574
What?

19:21.642 --> 19:23.359
Hey, baby.

19:23.444 --> 19:25.678
You almost had me.

19:25.746 --> 19:27.814
Again.

19:27.882 --> 19:29.883
But seeing you pick
on this pathetic,

19:29.950 --> 19:31.117
defenseless little man...

19:31.168 --> 19:32.352
Hey.

19:32.419 --> 19:34.988
Reminded me what kind
of a monster you are.

19:35.055 --> 19:36.155
You're a joke.

19:36.223 --> 19:38.124
You're not even a man anymore.

19:38.175 --> 19:40.176
Oh, and by the way, last night,

19:40.261 --> 19:42.212
I faked four out of the seven.

19:42.296 --> 19:45.231
Hmm. So did I.

19:45.299 --> 19:47.183
Let's go, son.

19:54.058 --> 19:55.742
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:55.809 --> 19:56.976
Sorry about the whole mess.

19:57.027 --> 19:58.695
The crisis has been averted,

19:58.779 --> 20:00.813
so let's go talk to the chief.

20:00.881 --> 20:02.115
Oh, I already talked to him.

20:02.182 --> 20:04.017
They'll give us the hours
we need, no problem.

20:04.084 --> 20:06.553
- Great. What a relief.
- Yeah.

20:08.222 --> 20:10.740
Hey, are you hungry?
I haven't eaten.

20:10.824 --> 20:11.891
You know, yeah.

20:11.959 --> 20:12.892
There's a really great
calzone place

20:12.960 --> 20:14.127
over in Idiotville.

20:14.194 --> 20:15.862
- Oh, really?
- Down on Terrible Idea Avenue.

20:15.930 --> 20:17.330
Okay. That's weird.

20:17.398 --> 20:21.601
'Cause I thought it was on
beating-a-dead-horse boulevard.

20:21.669 --> 20:23.236
Calzones are pointless.

20:23.304 --> 20:25.371
They're just pizza
that's harder to eat.

20:25.439 --> 20:27.574
No one likes them.

20:27.641 --> 20:28.975
Good day, sir.

20:29.042 --> 20:31.895
Leslie, I...
you know, I...

20:31.979 --> 20:33.646
I'm just kidding.
Let's go.

20:33.714 --> 20:34.880
Oh.

20:34.932 --> 20:36.983
Okay. That was funny.

20:40.022 --> 20:42.440
High and tight.

20:42.525 --> 20:44.526
Do you think
it's gonna leave a scar?

20:44.594 --> 20:46.261
Tom, women like scars.

20:46.312 --> 20:48.063
Shows you survived an attack,

20:48.114 --> 20:51.099
and they'll assume
the attack was from a man.

20:51.150 --> 20:54.236
Sorry, Ron, about everything.

20:54.287 --> 20:55.604
Ah.

20:55.671 --> 20:57.138
To true love.

20:57.206 --> 20:58.957
May we both find it.

20:59.041 --> 21:01.476
I'll drink to that.

21:02.545 --> 21:03.645
Nice glasses.

21:03.713 --> 21:05.780
Wedding present from Jerry.

21:05.848 --> 21:06.781
You're not gonna return them?

21:06.832 --> 21:09.017
Nah.
Too much hassle.
