00:01.760 --> 00:04.999
Operation Pear Tree files show
that DS Corbett has been out

00:05.000 --> 00:07.564
of contact with his COM and Cover
Officer for nearly three months.

00:07.566 --> 00:09.518
In that time,
he's believed to have actively

00:09.519 --> 00:12.756
participated in criminal offences,
namely the hijack of

00:12.757 --> 00:17.479
Seized Goods Transport ED-905, the
murder of three AFOs, the attempted

00:17.480 --> 00:20.759
murder of a fourth, and possibly
even the death of Maneet Bindra.

00:20.760 --> 00:22.719
Corbett relayed intel on a laptop

00:22.720 --> 00:25.531
being used to communicate
with higher levels of the OCG.

00:25.532 --> 00:26.946
Have you harvested enough information

00:26.971 --> 00:29.251
for us to impersonate the
unknown user online?

00:29.252 --> 00:32.151
Yes, given time,
we can simulate all the metadata.

00:32.152 --> 00:34.491
Hargreaves crossed us, so who's he
going to have crossed us to?

00:34.492 --> 00:36.651
So who do you think's the best
man for the job?

00:36.652 --> 00:39.691
H is a senior police officer.
Tell me I'm wrong.

00:40.827 --> 00:43.527
The PCC is anxious for a breakthrough.

00:43.528 --> 00:45.931
Not to worry. We're going to get our man.

00:45.932 --> 00:48.171
This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

00:48.172 --> 00:50.091
- How much?
- Hundred grand.

00:50.092 --> 00:51.492
Haven't we earned a payday?

00:53.372 --> 00:55.011
John Corbett, I'm arresting you

00:55.012 --> 00:57.204
for the murder of Lester Ha...

00:57.205 --> 01:00.411
I didn't mean to kill Hargreaves,
but now I have...

01:00.852 --> 01:02.452
...I've crossed the line.

01:04.965 --> 01:08.371
Mrs Hastings,
I'm Detective Sergeant Steve Arnott.

01:09.605 --> 01:12.878
A man broke in wearing a balaclava
over his face.

01:12.910 --> 01:15.891
He said you'd know why he did it.

01:15.892 --> 01:17.645
John Corbett was the name he was given

01:17.670 --> 01:19.666
when he was adopted by
the Corbett family.

01:19.667 --> 01:22.095
His adoptive mother's maiden
name was McGillis.

01:22.120 --> 01:23.639
He was born in Belfast.

01:23.640 --> 01:26.159
Does your husband have any
connection to Northern Ireland?

01:26.160 --> 01:28.599
John, they was here again, them
two from anti-corruption.

01:28.600 --> 01:29.966
What did they want?

01:29.991 --> 01:32.039
They was asking about
Northern Ireland and that.

01:32.040 --> 01:34.440
They was even asking about family
over there.

01:36.766 --> 01:38.846
- It'd be nice to catch up.
- Yes.

01:41.800 --> 01:44.743
Maybe you could help us
by describing any of the police

01:44.744 --> 01:46.270
that raided the print shop.

01:46.271 --> 01:48.200
I take photos.

01:49.332 --> 01:51.226
Christ, how long she's been there?

01:54.425 --> 01:55.984
I assaulted your gaffer's wife.

01:55.985 --> 01:58.424
He'll make sure I go down,
there's no two ways about it.

01:58.425 --> 01:59.744
Lee Banks?

01:59.745 --> 02:02.304
- Who the hell are you?
- Superintendent Hastings.

02:02.305 --> 02:04.860
Trust me, you'll be glad you did.

02:11.505 --> 02:14.264
You're a rat, John.

02:14.265 --> 02:15.545
A rat.

02:17.000 --> 02:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:25.465 --> 02:28.345
OK, now cover it up with all
this stuff. Come on.

02:30.839 --> 02:32.220
I feel terrible.

02:33.260 --> 02:36.011
I never asked you how your exams went.

02:36.520 --> 02:37.759
Yeah, fine.

02:37.760 --> 02:38.988
Great.

02:38.989 --> 02:41.100
Yeah. I got a date for my interview.

02:49.840 --> 02:52.419
Ryan here's got a date for his interview.

02:52.420 --> 02:53.420
Yeah?

02:54.380 --> 02:56.099
Smart boy.

02:56.100 --> 02:58.499
Guess you're going to have to lie
low from now on.

02:58.500 --> 02:59.940
Shit.

03:01.660 --> 03:03.060
I'm going to miss all this fun.

03:10.860 --> 03:13.420
- Cheers, Tatleen.
- Ma'am. Sarge.

03:14.500 --> 03:16.499
I've traced details
of John Corbett's parents.

03:16.500 --> 03:19.139
Corbett's birth name was John McGillis.

03:19.140 --> 03:22.059
His father, Anthony Patrick
McGillis, was the victim of a

03:22.060 --> 03:25.373
paramilitary murder in 1984 when
John was five years old.

03:25.374 --> 03:27.339
His mother, Anne-Marie McGillis,

03:27.340 --> 03:29.681
continued to live with John in Belfast.

03:29.682 --> 03:33.499
In 1989, Anne-Marie disappeared,
believed to have been kidnapped.

03:33.860 --> 03:36.563
Her remains weren't found until 2001.

03:36.564 --> 03:39.091
There was a forensic
investigation of the scene and body,

03:39.092 --> 03:40.899
but the case is unsolved.

03:40.900 --> 03:42.449
Do we know why she was kidnapped?

03:42.474 --> 03:45.286
According to files
held at the time by the Royal Ulster

03:45.311 --> 03:49.318
Constabulary, Anne-Marie was
accused of being a police informant.

03:49.346 --> 03:52.620
This is the postmortem report from 2001.

03:53.592 --> 03:56.716
Before she was executed with
a single gunshot to the head,

03:56.741 --> 03:58.580
Anne-Marie McGillis had been tortured.

03:59.712 --> 04:01.022
The postmortem detected

04:01.047 --> 04:04.615
gunshot wounds to the wrists,
knees and ankles.

04:04.640 --> 04:06.519
The same injuries as Roisin.

04:06.544 --> 04:08.133
Cheers, Tatleen, we'll take it from here.

04:08.158 --> 04:10.700
- Strictly 10-8 on this.
- Ma'am.

04:13.700 --> 04:15.460
Sarge.

04:25.900 --> 04:29.740
In 1989, Hastings was a PC in the RUC.

04:32.232 --> 04:33.997
When he passed the sergeants' exam,

04:34.022 --> 04:36.180
he chose to transfer over
here on promotion.

04:36.989 --> 04:39.188
There's nothing on his record
refers to him

04:39.189 --> 04:41.220
investigating the disappearance
of Anne-Marie McGillis.

04:42.269 --> 04:44.988
There's a reference to
prolonged sick leave.

04:44.989 --> 04:46.752
The only story the Gaffer ever told me

04:46.753 --> 04:50.468
about those days was about getting
seriously injured by a pipe bomb.

04:50.469 --> 04:52.792
Significant that should happen
shortly after

04:52.793 --> 04:55.700
- Anne-Marie McGillis disappeared.
- Yeah.

05:00.824 --> 05:03.543
Ted.

05:03.568 --> 05:04.888
Ma'am.

05:12.910 --> 05:16.189
Superintendent Hastings, I was very
sorry to hear about the assault

05:16.190 --> 05:18.426
on your wife. I hope she's making a
speedy recovery.

05:18.427 --> 05:20.233
Yes, she is. Thank you.

05:20.234 --> 05:22.691
I want to be transparent on police
corruption.

05:22.692 --> 05:24.996
The public needs to know
we're investigating

05:24.997 --> 05:29.105
institutionalised complicity between
the police and organised crime.

05:29.106 --> 05:30.966
Alleged complicity.

05:30.967 --> 05:34.064
And the lack of progress puts me
in an invidious position.

05:34.065 --> 05:37.459
It's better anti-corruption doesn't
exist than it's seen to fail.

05:37.460 --> 05:40.390
I'm being strongly advised to
suppress the truth.

05:41.790 --> 05:43.071
The truth?

05:43.072 --> 05:44.940
That corrupt officers are winning.

05:45.790 --> 05:47.069
Hang on a minute.

05:47.070 --> 05:49.470
It's hard enough catching criminals,
never mind bent coppers.

05:49.471 --> 05:50.910
Andrea.

05:50.911 --> 05:54.749
Ted, you'll receive written
notification, AC-12's authority

05:54.750 --> 05:57.830
to investigate Operation Pear Tree
has been rescinded.

06:00.350 --> 06:02.095
You're taking us off the case, ma'am?

06:02.096 --> 06:04.721
I've asked Detective Chief
Superintendent Carmichael to

06:04.722 --> 06:07.175
drop in later.
I haven't told her the reason yet.

06:07.176 --> 06:09.895
My team just need a little bit
more time, ma'am.

06:09.896 --> 06:11.695
You've had your time.

06:12.035 --> 06:13.595
Thank you, Ted.

06:16.796 --> 06:18.220
Ma'am.

06:23.216 --> 06:24.975
This is a complete mess.

06:24.976 --> 06:26.695
Of your own making.

06:27.100 --> 06:29.095
Rohan, no-one wants to lie.

06:29.096 --> 06:31.455
But part of our duty is to
uphold public trust,

06:31.456 --> 06:33.175
and sometimes that means having

06:33.176 --> 06:35.736
a non-exclusive relationship
with the truth.

07:02.256 --> 07:05.200
We've made repeated
attempts to contact the OCG

07:05.225 --> 07:06.695
using text communication to their laptop.

07:06.696 --> 07:09.215
So far, our messages haven't
been returned.

07:09.216 --> 07:11.455
Maybe they've rumbled the impersonation.

07:11.456 --> 07:12.815
Yes, that's possible.

07:12.816 --> 07:15.455
As you know, we've been able to
identify Corbett's burner

07:15.456 --> 07:18.575
phone on the targeted surveillance
of his wife's communications.

07:18.576 --> 07:21.055
We've been making good
progress in harvesting

07:21.056 --> 07:23.295
the metadata from his service provider.

07:23.860 --> 07:27.575
Here's a map created from historical
metadata on the phone's positions.

07:27.576 --> 07:31.333
The hot spots represent habitual
locations we already detected,

07:31.334 --> 07:34.420
such as his apartment
and Kingsgate Printing Services.

07:43.816 --> 07:46.335
We've been moving on to analyse
lukewarm spots

07:46.336 --> 07:48.215
and some have been reconnoitred.

07:48.216 --> 07:51.187
We identified a nightclub
in the Kingsgate area.

07:52.773 --> 07:53.775
Sir.

07:53.776 --> 07:58.220
Sir. I've been thinking about this
nightclub.

07:59.500 --> 08:01.215
Well, I do read the reports.

08:01.216 --> 08:05.020
Meet me downstairs. I've got a plan
of how we're going to proceed.

08:09.001 --> 08:10.130
Thanks.

08:10.515 --> 08:11.580
Ma'am.

08:18.343 --> 08:19.663
Sir.

08:21.400 --> 08:22.655
Sir, with respect,

08:22.656 --> 08:25.820
we need to consider exactly what it
is we're trying to achieve here.

08:34.260 --> 08:37.020
I'm banking that
Corbett is going to attempt some

08:37.020 --> 08:39.495
kind of authentication at this point.

08:39.496 --> 08:42.503
This nightclub seems to be
their current hideaway.

08:42.504 --> 08:45.531
If we look at burner phone activity
here, at this location,

08:45.532 --> 08:47.800
then the second that Corbett
or one of his wee mates

08:47.825 --> 08:50.170
tries to contact the nominals
further up the chain,

08:50.171 --> 08:51.820
then we'll have a trail to the top man.

09:00.336 --> 09:02.336
Oh, here we go.

09:02.766 --> 09:04.235
_

09:04.236 --> 09:05.611
_

09:05.636 --> 09:06.927
They're challenging us to name

09:06.928 --> 09:08.580
the meeting at the Palisades
Shopping Centre.

09:09.380 --> 09:10.695
They normally use audio.

09:10.696 --> 09:12.455
What's going on?

09:12.702 --> 09:14.981
We don't even know if this is
Corbett at the other end.

09:14.982 --> 09:17.960
It's an unknown user
with a new IP address,

09:17.961 --> 09:20.901
but they can achieve that using
a new dongle on their computer.

09:20.902 --> 09:23.341
Right. OK.

09:30.942 --> 09:32.513
_

09:32.553 --> 09:33.917
_

09:33.942 --> 09:36.781
Referencing the Palisades
meeting is an approved

09:36.782 --> 09:38.660
element of our pre-agreed responses.

09:42.428 --> 09:43.868
OK.

09:49.952 --> 09:51.952
_

09:53.782 --> 09:55.941
OK, so H was a no-show at the meeting.

09:55.942 --> 09:57.682
He may have spotted our surveillance,

09:57.683 --> 10:00.661
but I'm backing us to be too clever
to allow that to happen.

10:01.020 --> 10:04.300
I'm going to take a gamble that he
was in the dark about it.

10:09.242 --> 10:10.882
Here we go.

10:11.678 --> 10:12.786
_

10:12.811 --> 10:16.101
Bang! Now we're cooking with gas!
What next?

10:16.102 --> 10:19.452
Our preferred option is to request
information on the whereabouts

10:19.453 --> 10:20.982
of the stolen goods.

10:31.031 --> 10:33.031
_

10:52.135 --> 10:53.535
Christ's sake.

10:54.520 --> 10:56.403
The Gaffer can't authorise
an undercover op

10:56.404 --> 10:58.550
and be the UCO at the same time.

10:58.551 --> 11:00.580
There's no independent decision-making.

11:01.151 --> 11:02.790
Is he even trained in undercover?

11:02.791 --> 11:04.111
God knows.

11:08.700 --> 11:10.750
I'm going to have to report this.

11:15.104 --> 11:16.623
Kate, wait.

11:17.140 --> 11:19.430
Steve, regs are regs.

11:19.431 --> 11:21.976
We don't get to decide which ones
we like and which ones we don't.

11:21.977 --> 11:23.510
The Gaffer knows that.

11:23.511 --> 11:26.190
When my undercover was questioned,
he backed me.

11:26.500 --> 11:28.580
Look, I know he's going through a lot.

11:29.540 --> 11:30.950
I'll talk to him.

11:30.951 --> 11:32.870
- I'll come with you.
- No.

11:32.871 --> 11:34.351
I'm the DI.

11:40.219 --> 11:41.353
Yes?

11:41.700 --> 11:42.870
Sir.

11:43.298 --> 11:44.778
Kate.

11:46.631 --> 11:50.150
Sir, I honestly don't believe it's
lawful for the same senior officer

11:50.151 --> 11:53.350
to sanction an undercover operation
and carry it out without consulting

11:53.351 --> 11:56.864
the head of the Covert Unit or some
other independent officer.

11:56.865 --> 11:59.950
I also believe that whoever's TFC
on this will not be able to

11:59.951 --> 12:01.500
guarantee your safety.

12:01.911 --> 12:04.350
I recommend we commence
a covert surveillance

12:04.351 --> 12:06.806
operation on the nightclub
with a view to apprehending

12:06.807 --> 12:09.710
Corbett, McQueen and any other
OCG nominal detected.

12:10.404 --> 12:11.524
Sir.

12:15.531 --> 12:16.860
OK.

12:20.580 --> 12:21.790
Sir?

12:21.791 --> 12:25.860
OK. Start the surveillance.

12:30.751 --> 12:33.910
Sir, is there something you're
not telling us?

12:34.484 --> 12:36.084
No.

12:38.251 --> 12:39.931
Thank you, sir.

12:54.936 --> 12:56.455
Welcome to the messaging

12:56.480 --> 12:59.205
service for Mark Moffatt,
Kettle Bell Property Partners.

12:59.206 --> 13:00.991
No-one is available...

13:17.018 --> 13:19.218
- All right, Kyle?
- Steve.

13:20.271 --> 13:23.990
No sign yet of Corbett.
Looking like a quiet night so far.

13:23.991 --> 13:26.760
Ideally we want to strike
when they're all there

13:26.785 --> 13:28.910
Corbett, McQueen, Minkowicz and the rest.

13:28.911 --> 13:30.510
But Corbett's the priority.

13:30.511 --> 13:31.740
All right?

13:32.791 --> 13:34.270
Call me when he's sighted.

13:34.580 --> 13:36.070
Off somewhere nice?

13:36.071 --> 13:37.470
Might be.

13:37.471 --> 13:38.910
Cheeky bastard.

13:38.911 --> 13:41.511
- Bring pizza next time.
- See you.

13:50.039 --> 13:51.610
I'm glad you called.

13:52.060 --> 13:54.110
I was worried you'd still be
pissed off with me.

13:54.111 --> 13:55.830
Who says I'm not?

13:56.420 --> 13:58.910
Just cos you've got bumfluff
all over your face doesn't mean

13:58.911 --> 14:01.470
- you have to be an arse.
- You can borrow my razor any time.

14:01.471 --> 14:03.030
Oi!

14:03.799 --> 14:05.159
How's it going at work?

14:06.718 --> 14:08.798
Weird is how it's going.

14:09.831 --> 14:11.910
We've got an Acting DCS and she's great,

14:12.380 --> 14:14.660
but everyone's still
talking about Hargreaves.

14:16.307 --> 14:17.626
Looking back.

14:17.651 --> 14:20.140
- Were there any signs?
- Yeah.

14:21.191 --> 14:25.013
Are AC-12 opening an investigation
into the whole of Serious Crime,

14:25.014 --> 14:26.728
seeing if we were all in on it?

14:26.729 --> 14:28.831
We haven't got the manpower.

14:33.498 --> 14:35.098
Sorry.

14:37.271 --> 14:38.540
No.

14:38.951 --> 14:40.150
There weren't any signs.

14:40.151 --> 14:41.340
I wish there were.

14:42.340 --> 14:44.591
I guess there never are till
it's too late.

14:47.998 --> 14:49.518
Want another?

14:50.740 --> 14:52.190
It's up to you.

14:52.580 --> 14:53.820
I'm fine.

14:55.380 --> 14:58.711
I'm not, by the way,
pissed off with you any more.

15:01.091 --> 15:02.491
Good.

15:03.898 --> 15:05.458
Good.

15:13.957 --> 15:15.797
You coming?

15:36.461 --> 15:37.812
Something wrong?

15:38.685 --> 15:40.085
It's fine.

15:59.291 --> 16:00.931
Stop.

16:04.177 --> 16:05.497
Stop.

16:12.417 --> 16:13.897
Give me a minute.

16:15.791 --> 16:19.471
Steve, don't worry, it's not a problem.

16:32.091 --> 16:34.260
- Steve.
- I won't be a minute.

16:37.100 --> 16:40.180
Maybe there's just too much going
on with work or something.

16:41.700 --> 16:43.590
Or maybe it's something
to do with your back.

16:43.591 --> 16:45.500
You hurt it really badly.

17:48.724 --> 17:50.244
Shit.

18:22.751 --> 18:24.670
Can I help you, sir?

18:24.671 --> 18:27.300
A bit of a quiet night.
Business on the slide?

18:28.957 --> 18:30.477
Our business is fine.

18:31.544 --> 18:32.864
What's yours?

18:38.631 --> 18:41.260
John Clayton about?
I'd like to speak to him.

18:47.311 --> 18:49.332
- Wait here, sir.
- Clayton, mind.

18:49.333 --> 18:51.151
I don't want to talk to anybody else.

19:03.671 --> 19:07.030
Hey, Lis. Copper looking for John.

19:07.031 --> 19:08.511
Who?

19:14.511 --> 19:16.110
This one.

19:16.111 --> 19:17.910
- Did he show ID?
- Mm-hm.

19:17.911 --> 19:20.020
Superintendent Hastings.

19:21.537 --> 19:22.737
Hastings.

19:25.625 --> 19:26.945
H.

19:27.878 --> 19:29.318
He said he'd come.

19:37.231 --> 19:39.110
The Gaffer went in
about half an hour ago.

19:39.111 --> 19:40.550
No sign of him coming out.

19:40.551 --> 19:42.310
- Corbett?
- Still unsighted,

19:42.311 --> 19:44.991
but McQueen and Minkowicz
entered earlier tonight.

19:46.380 --> 19:49.030
God knows what the Gaffer's playing at.

19:49.031 --> 19:53.712
So, er, this Eastfield job, that was
Clayton's bright idea, wasn't it?

19:53.737 --> 19:55.337
Where is he?

20:02.231 --> 20:03.620
Lisa.

20:04.398 --> 20:06.118
We need to take some precautions.

20:10.020 --> 20:12.470
Well, I was just, erm,

20:12.471 --> 20:14.470
talking to Miroslav here.

20:14.818 --> 20:16.258
Where's Clayton?

20:18.620 --> 20:20.030
John's lying low.

20:20.031 --> 20:23.140
- The situation got too hot for him.
- Oh, right.

20:23.951 --> 20:27.310
Well, look, I need to talk to him
cos this is business.

20:27.311 --> 20:30.270
- Talk to me.
- Oh...

20:30.271 --> 20:32.470
Well, these Eastfield goods
are going to be difficult

20:32.471 --> 20:34.070
to get out the country, you know?

20:34.071 --> 20:35.990
We're all looking for a payday, right?

20:36.540 --> 20:39.030
Every cop in three counties is
going to be looking for the goods,

20:39.031 --> 20:41.630
so we've got to find a way of
throwing them off the scent.

20:41.631 --> 20:43.550
What better way to grease the wheels

20:43.551 --> 20:45.630
to get the head of anti-corruption...

20:45.631 --> 20:48.150
...who knows every bent cop going?

20:48.710 --> 20:50.270
You need to be more than that.

20:51.598 --> 20:52.798
What about H?

20:54.104 --> 20:55.504
If you want to use that term.

20:59.470 --> 21:01.270
How come you're showing your face?

21:02.311 --> 21:06.390
How come you're here on your own,
no crew backing you up?

21:06.391 --> 21:08.110
There's no time.

21:08.111 --> 21:09.990
This needs to happen fast.

21:09.991 --> 21:11.950
And this is between us.

21:11.951 --> 21:13.940
We're doing things my way.

21:19.631 --> 21:20.951
We'll take no chances.

21:24.740 --> 21:27.390
- I'd really rather you didn't.
- Don't make this harder.

21:27.391 --> 21:29.300
No disrespect intended.

21:31.655 --> 21:33.030
Armed police! Do not move!

21:33.031 --> 21:35.110
Do not move!

21:35.111 --> 21:37.913
- Stay where you are!
- Get down! Get down!

21:37.938 --> 21:39.470
Don't move!

21:39.471 --> 21:41.430
Don't move! Show me your hands!

21:41.431 --> 21:43.150
Stay there!

21:43.151 --> 21:46.100
Don't move! Stay there!

21:49.151 --> 21:51.896
- Six Four, urgent message.
- Four Five.

21:51.897 --> 21:53.309
No visual with the Gaffer.

21:53.334 --> 21:54.568
Searching premises.

21:54.569 --> 21:56.630
Unarmed stay out till secure.

21:56.950 --> 21:58.350
Received.

22:22.157 --> 22:23.317
All right.

22:27.620 --> 22:29.190
No.

22:29.191 --> 22:31.310
Keep him in the car for a while.

22:31.620 --> 22:33.790
Let's wait and see if
he's being followed, yeah?

22:34.085 --> 22:35.525
Well, what if he is?

22:56.804 --> 22:57.964
Boss.

23:07.751 --> 23:08.919
What happened?

23:08.944 --> 23:10.390
There's a door into
the adjoining building

23:10.391 --> 23:12.870
leading to an exit we didn't have
under surveillance.

23:13.100 --> 23:14.630
I'm sorry, boss.

23:14.631 --> 23:15.950
It's not your fault, mate.

23:15.951 --> 23:18.340
This is why I told the Gaffer
not to do this.

23:19.180 --> 23:22.273
Well, now I know why. The paperwork
came through from the DCC's office.

23:22.274 --> 23:24.747
- We got taken off the case this morning.
- Shit.

23:24.748 --> 23:26.599
Is there any other leads on
where they're taking him?

23:26.600 --> 23:28.790
An all-units bulletin's been on
the air for half an hour already,

23:28.791 --> 23:30.550
circulated to neighbouring forces.

23:30.900 --> 23:32.510
No obs reported.

23:32.900 --> 23:34.031
Christ.

23:52.991 --> 23:54.551
Well...

23:55.980 --> 23:58.750
...Clayton wasn't lying,
this really is...

23:59.060 --> 24:01.460
...some haul.

24:03.500 --> 24:04.910
Is he here?

24:05.220 --> 24:07.070
Told you, he's lying low.

24:07.071 --> 24:09.790
Yeah, right. Well, I need him
on the inside.

24:10.060 --> 24:12.070
I don't need him banging
around like some loose cannon,

24:12.071 --> 24:14.680
- ready to blow the gaff.
- What's your plan?

24:15.871 --> 24:18.790
Well, notices will have been
sent out to the port authorities

24:18.791 --> 24:22.110
and the border agencies,
so I think our best option

24:22.111 --> 24:25.702
is to fly this stuff out
through some private airport

24:25.703 --> 24:26.910
with slack security.

24:27.300 --> 24:28.550
I mean...

24:28.551 --> 24:31.054
...there's a hell of a lot of cargo here,

24:31.055 --> 24:32.277
it's going to take a couple of flights.

24:32.278 --> 24:33.910
I think we should start with the drugs

24:34.120 --> 24:36.119
cos they'll be the easiest got rid of,

24:36.120 --> 24:38.999
- and we can use the Spanish connection.
- What airfield?

24:39.000 --> 24:41.159
Well, that'd be Green Hill Aerodrome.

24:41.160 --> 24:44.519
At the minute, we're investigating
a number of drug squad officers

24:44.520 --> 24:47.399
who are under suspicion
for smuggling contraband

24:47.400 --> 24:50.054
and it seems that Green Hill Aerodrome

24:50.055 --> 24:51.778
is their preferred route out.

24:51.779 --> 24:53.518
So that's why we have to move fast

24:53.519 --> 24:55.359
because there's only a small
window of opportunity

24:55.360 --> 24:57.319
before the surveillance starts on Monday.

24:57.320 --> 25:00.119
So, first flight tomorrow night,
two or three more after that,

25:00.120 --> 25:02.740
we get the whole thing wrapped
up by the weekend. What do you say?

25:03.880 --> 25:07.599
I just... I don't believe
that H would show up on his own.

25:07.600 --> 25:09.079
Oh, right. OK.

25:09.080 --> 25:12.839
So now I get why Clayton
ended up bossing this unit,

25:12.840 --> 25:17.559
because he would not have
the temerity to piss me off.

25:17.560 --> 25:19.199
Now you find out where Clayton is,

25:19.200 --> 25:22.660
get him in here, so I can
have a proper conversation.

25:33.739 --> 25:35.420
What are you going to do, Lisa?

25:41.220 --> 25:42.540
Lisa?

25:44.040 --> 25:46.959
It's the cops!

25:52.123 --> 25:53.606
Armed police!

25:54.600 --> 25:56.519
Stay where you are.

25:56.520 --> 25:59.039
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
- Hands where I can see them!

25:59.040 --> 26:00.639
Hands where I can see them!

26:00.640 --> 26:03.439
It's all right.
We're all cooperating, fella.

26:03.440 --> 26:07.079
Six Four, scene secured. Two under
control, unarmed clear to enter.

26:07.080 --> 26:08.203
You crossed us.

26:08.228 --> 26:09.562
- Not me. Not me.
- Shut up!

26:09.563 --> 26:12.199
Control to unarmed Bronze.
All unarmed to move forward.

26:12.200 --> 26:14.267
Repeat, all unarmed to move forward.

26:14.268 --> 26:17.919
- Search her.
- Six Four, One GSW, ambulance required.

26:17.920 --> 26:20.749
Control received.
One subject down with GSW.

26:20.750 --> 26:25.058
I'm arresting you on suspicion of
Conspiracy to Commit Armed Robbery.

26:25.059 --> 26:28.279
It may harm your defence if you
do not mention, when questioned,

26:28.280 --> 26:30.079
something you later rely on in court.

26:30.080 --> 26:32.380
Anything you do say
may be used in evidence.

27:00.600 --> 27:02.200
There's no keeping this quiet.

27:03.920 --> 27:06.740
Alpha Charlie Four Five, two in custody.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.040
Sir.

27:37.600 --> 27:39.253
- Sir.
- I was hoping you two guys

27:39.278 --> 27:40.399
would save my bacon.

27:40.400 --> 27:42.119
How did you manage it?

27:42.120 --> 27:44.719
We exploited the contact numbers
from Corbett's burner.

27:44.720 --> 27:46.399
One of these was pinged at the nightclub

27:46.400 --> 27:48.479
and a live trace led us out of town.

27:48.480 --> 27:50.639
The phone was found on
Miroslav Minkowicz's body.

27:50.640 --> 27:53.919
Great work. And thanks for keeping
up the pretence in front of McQueen.

27:53.920 --> 27:56.559
She is our best chance of
bringing Corbett in.

27:56.560 --> 27:59.399
You'll appreciate, sir, we do
need to ask you a few questions.

27:59.400 --> 28:01.740
Yeah, well, let me save you the trouble.

28:02.360 --> 28:04.479
DCC Wise, she took us off the case.

28:04.480 --> 28:06.479
It could have been the end of AC-12.

28:06.480 --> 28:10.919
Look, I'm sorry that I didn't bring
you in on what I was planning,

28:10.920 --> 28:12.439
but it was the only way.

28:12.440 --> 28:14.719
Unfortunately, Corbett has
gone to ground,

28:14.720 --> 28:17.399
but my hunch is he will be back
sooner rather than later

28:17.400 --> 28:18.759
with his tail between his legs.

28:18.760 --> 28:21.839
But right now, you know what? I'll
give you a statement in the morning.

28:21.840 --> 28:22.959
I just want to get home.

28:22.960 --> 28:25.920
Sir, you should remain here
for your own protection.

28:28.160 --> 28:30.479
I just want... I just want to get home.

28:30.480 --> 28:32.559
Stick a couple of AFOs outside the door.

28:32.560 --> 28:36.319
Sir, if the OCG finds out you're not
in custody, it poses a serious and

28:36.320 --> 28:39.860
credible threat to an investigation
we've all worked so hard for.

28:40.320 --> 28:42.260
We need to maintain the pretence.

28:48.320 --> 28:49.559
Yeah.

28:49.560 --> 28:52.940
Yeah, OK. Yeah. OK.

28:56.880 --> 28:58.520
- Sir.
- Sir.

29:35.466 --> 29:37.226
Ah. I thought you'd be in bed.

29:39.240 --> 29:41.359
I was worried sick.

29:41.360 --> 29:42.840
I didn't get a chance to call.

29:45.840 --> 29:48.380
You said your promotion
meant better hours.

29:49.040 --> 29:51.860
You could be a mum as well
as a police officer.

29:54.733 --> 29:57.212
Thanks for making me feel like shit.

29:57.237 --> 29:58.677
Nice one.

30:04.640 --> 30:08.120
Alpha Charlie Six One.
Corridor secure, clear to approach.

30:21.800 --> 30:24.919
Did you participate in, or are you
able to provide any information,

30:24.920 --> 30:26.839
on the following offences?

30:26.840 --> 30:31.959
The hijack of Transport ED-905
on the 15th of February 2019,

30:31.960 --> 30:34.879
the hijack of ballistics transport BC-556

30:34.880 --> 30:38.000
on the 27th of February 2019

30:38.025 --> 30:40.159
and the armed robbery
of the Eastfield Depot

30:40.160 --> 30:42.839
on the 5th of March 2019?

30:43.133 --> 30:44.373
No comment.

30:45.360 --> 30:48.759
The murders of PC Ray Randhawa,
PC Kevin Greysham

30:48.760 --> 30:52.639
and PC Carl Waldhouse
on the 15th of February 2019

30:52.640 --> 30:55.759
and the attempted murder of
PS Jane Cafferty on the same date?

30:55.760 --> 30:57.159
No comment.

30:57.160 --> 31:01.940
The murder of PC Maneet Bindra on
or before the 23rd of February 2019?

31:02.713 --> 31:03.953
No comment.

31:05.680 --> 31:08.439
The murder of Detective Chief
Superintendent Lester Hargreaves

31:08.440 --> 31:10.599
on the 5th of March 2019?

31:10.600 --> 31:11.919
No comment.

31:11.920 --> 31:14.839
Lisa, we've got a mass of evidence
on the organised crime group

31:14.840 --> 31:16.799
you're a member of.
From the nightclub office,

31:16.800 --> 31:19.279
forensic investigators
recovered a laptop computer

31:19.280 --> 31:21.999
with your fingerprints
all over the keyboard.

31:22.000 --> 31:25.460
If convicted, you'll spend the best
years of your life in prison.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.480
But there is an alternative.

31:29.920 --> 31:32.399
Our side of the inquiry is
the corrupt police officers

31:32.400 --> 31:34.420
who've colluded in these offences.

31:35.120 --> 31:36.600
We need your help with that.

31:40.080 --> 31:41.440
Witness protection.

31:42.760 --> 31:44.679
Immunity.

31:44.680 --> 31:46.039
Provided you're not ineligible

31:46.040 --> 31:48.460
due to committing the most
serious offences.

31:49.400 --> 31:53.340
Did you participate in any of
the murders listed by DI Fleming?

31:54.040 --> 31:55.080
No.

31:56.080 --> 31:58.540
We'll still need to look into that,
of course.

31:59.120 --> 32:01.119
We require information on
the higher echelons

32:01.120 --> 32:02.640
of the organised crime group.

32:03.960 --> 32:05.520
You're asking a lot.

32:06.680 --> 32:08.040
I need to think about that.

32:09.720 --> 32:12.760
There is one individual we're
particularly interested in.

32:13.800 --> 32:16.000
Do you recognise the code name H?

32:18.600 --> 32:20.960
Is your boss watching all this?

32:22.200 --> 32:24.359
Superintendent Hastings is in custody,

32:24.360 --> 32:27.060
under investigation for his links
with the OCG.

32:31.753 --> 32:32.993
Is he H?

32:41.600 --> 32:42.919
Sorry.

32:42.920 --> 32:44.320
No comment.

32:49.160 --> 32:52.079
Lisa, it'd be great to have
something to prove

32:52.080 --> 32:53.559
you're assisting the inquiry,

32:53.560 --> 32:56.559
to get the ball rolling with
witness protection and immunity.

32:56.560 --> 32:59.559
One piece of information
we require urgently

32:59.560 --> 33:01.660
is the whereabouts of John Clayton.

33:02.320 --> 33:04.679
I ain't seen him for at least
a couple of days.

33:04.680 --> 33:06.279
Why not?

33:06.280 --> 33:08.660
We got a tip-off that there was
a rat in the unit.

33:09.160 --> 33:10.780
He must have lost his bottle.

33:11.360 --> 33:12.880
Where'd the tip-off come from?

33:14.040 --> 33:15.080
No names.

33:16.240 --> 33:18.300
You'll have to find that out
for yourselves.

33:19.120 --> 33:22.660
But it came from out of Blackthorn.

33:24.720 --> 33:28.479
Maybe someone inside Blackthorn knew
about Corbett from another inmate.

33:28.480 --> 33:31.759
Well, that's a long shot. Corbett
was brought in from Merseyside.

33:34.400 --> 33:38.559
Ma'am, Sarge, Governor-authorised
police visits to Blackthorn Prison.

33:38.560 --> 33:40.000
Cheers, Tatleen.

33:50.920 --> 33:53.039
The Gaffer made a visit
on the 12th of March.

33:53.040 --> 33:57.260
To Lee Banks,
the only current OCG member inside.

33:58.360 --> 33:59.660
Christ.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.799
Well, it's there, in black and white.

34:01.800 --> 34:03.999
The Gaffer found out that
Corbett was the one

34:04.000 --> 34:06.879
responsible for assaulting his wife.
He goes to visit Lee Banks.

34:06.880 --> 34:09.719
Lee Banks passes on a message to
the OCG that there's an undercover

34:09.719 --> 34:11.279
officer in their ranks.

34:11.280 --> 34:13.998
I mean, obviously we don't know
that's exactly how it happened,

34:14.000 --> 34:15.400
but... No, we don't.

34:17.400 --> 34:21.780
- Well...
- You know what I've got to do.

34:22.480 --> 34:23.840
You've got no choice, mate.

34:26.040 --> 34:27.360
Thanks, Steve.

34:28.719 --> 34:32.800
Well, as for Corbett, let's hope
he went to ground in time.

34:57.720 --> 35:00.239
The number you have
dialled is not available.

35:00.240 --> 35:02.440
Please record your message
after the tone.

35:03.720 --> 35:06.180
John, if you get this...

35:07.320 --> 35:08.879
...you're in danger.

35:08.880 --> 35:10.799
I think your cover's been compromised.

35:10.800 --> 35:13.439
You've gotta come in. I promise you,
you'll be treated fairly.

35:13.440 --> 35:16.519
I'll do everything I can so you can
give your side of the story.

35:16.520 --> 35:19.620
Just come in, mate, before it's too late.

35:29.520 --> 35:32.559
- DI Fleming, ma'am.
- DS Arnott, ma'am.

35:32.560 --> 35:34.919
I've asked DI Randall to take notes.

35:34.920 --> 35:37.719
I've been advised you want
to discuss a sensitive matter

35:37.720 --> 35:41.540
relating to AC-12's investigation
into Operation Pear Tree.

35:42.280 --> 35:43.880
I don't do this lightly, ma'am.

35:46.560 --> 35:49.319
It relates to
Superintendent Hastings, ma'am.

35:49.320 --> 35:53.239
I've a number of concerns regarding
his recent professional conduct.

35:53.240 --> 35:55.639
Specifically, there was
a potentially unlawful

35:55.640 --> 35:59.519
Fahrenheit order given to DS Arnott
and the recovery of the stolen goods

35:59.520 --> 36:02.719
involved an unauthorised
undercover operation.

36:02.720 --> 36:04.220
God's sake!

36:04.840 --> 36:08.263
Ma'am, we've also detected
circumstantial evidence

36:08.264 --> 36:10.519
that Superintendent Hastings
may have deliberately

36:10.520 --> 36:12.260
blown John Corbett's cover.

36:13.220 --> 36:14.580
My God.

36:15.400 --> 36:17.759
Has Corbett been able to reach
a place of safety?

36:17.760 --> 36:19.039
We don't know yet, ma'am.

36:19.040 --> 36:22.119
We're conducting urgent inquiries,
ma'am, in an effort to locate him.

36:22.120 --> 36:24.959
Given what you've disclosed,
I've got no choice but to order

36:24.960 --> 36:28.080
an outside investigation
into Superintendent Hastings.

36:29.280 --> 36:31.159
Yes, ma'am. We understand.

36:31.160 --> 36:32.839
Where is he now?

36:32.840 --> 36:35.860
We're housing him, ma'am, at AC-12.

36:42.240 --> 36:44.679
- Very sorry, sir.
- Oh!

36:44.680 --> 36:46.719
- Thank you.
- Ah, Gill.

36:46.720 --> 36:48.256
What are you doing in here?

36:48.257 --> 36:53.399
Yeah, well, this is my gambit to get
the OCG nominal talking.

36:53.400 --> 36:55.599
Meanwhile, I'm cooped up in here
going off my trolley.

36:55.600 --> 36:56.879
So good news, I think, yeah?

36:56.880 --> 36:59.039
You know, we managed to
neutralise the OCG,

36:59.040 --> 37:00.839
get the loot back from the Eastfield job,

37:00.840 --> 37:05.159
so should be back in the DCC's
good books, I'd say.

37:05.160 --> 37:07.519
Sorry, Ted. The opposite.

37:07.520 --> 37:10.279
There's been some extremely serious
allegations,

37:10.280 --> 37:12.740
which need to be thoroughly investigated.

37:14.200 --> 37:16.300
What kind of allegations?

37:17.320 --> 37:19.340
I'm not at liberty to say.

37:19.960 --> 37:22.079
I know I'm playing a bit fast
and loose at the moment,

37:22.080 --> 37:24.359
but my team'll back me up,
they always do.

37:24.360 --> 37:25.940
Not always.

37:28.760 --> 37:31.951
No. I-I don't believe you. Name them.

37:31.952 --> 37:33.919
The officer, or officers,
concerned have the right

37:33.920 --> 37:37.220
for their allegations to be handled
in strictest confidence.

37:37.880 --> 37:39.719
Mother of God.

37:39.720 --> 37:40.999
My own team?

37:41.000 --> 37:44.559
I'm here as a concerned colleague
to offer my sincere advice

37:44.560 --> 37:48.479
on how to avoid an embarrassing
finish to a distinguished career.

37:48.480 --> 37:50.719
Now, we need to move fast.

37:50.720 --> 37:53.439
Retirement will put you out of reach
of disciplinary procedures.

37:53.440 --> 37:56.367
There's such a thing
as reputation, you know?

37:56.368 --> 37:58.639
What are these allegations?
I'll fight them, just you watch!

37:58.640 --> 38:00.079
Who's leading the investigation?

38:00.080 --> 38:02.279
An outside unit with an
anti-corruption SIO at least

38:02.280 --> 38:04.039
one rank senior to you.

38:04.040 --> 38:08.239
Oh, Jesus Christ!
Not Patricia bloody Carmichael.

38:08.240 --> 38:10.199
That one has been fast-tracked
from day one.

38:10.200 --> 38:13.279
She hasn't put in the same years
as the rest of us mere mortals.

38:13.280 --> 38:16.519
I tell you, she'll see my scalp as a
step up the ladder, believe you me.

38:16.520 --> 38:17.679
Look, Ted, I can help you.

38:17.680 --> 38:20.359
I used to be a defence solicitor,
a bloody good one.

38:20.360 --> 38:23.460
No, that's all right, Gill. I'll
make my own arrangements, thank you.

38:24.320 --> 38:26.639
Well, you're your own man,
Ted, you always have been.

38:26.640 --> 38:28.760
But don't say that I didn't try...

38:29.720 --> 38:32.880
...which is why I wanted to be
the one to notify you.

38:34.040 --> 38:35.359
Notify me?

38:35.360 --> 38:40.159
This is a standard letter which will
accompany the Regulation 15 Notice.

38:40.160 --> 38:42.340
You're being suspended from duty.

38:43.600 --> 38:45.360
I'm really sorry, Ted.

39:08.400 --> 39:11.159
Sir? Sir, you're not meant
to leave the building

39:11.160 --> 39:12.799
without DI Fleming's permission.

39:12.800 --> 39:15.959
Kate and Steve aren't in the building,
otherwise they'd have to answer to me.

39:15.960 --> 39:18.759
You tell them to get their stories
straight by the time I get back.

39:18.760 --> 39:21.479
But, sir, I'm under orders
to stop you leaving AC-12.

39:21.480 --> 39:22.895
Am I under arrest?

39:22.920 --> 39:24.544
- Uh, no, sir.
- Precisely.

39:30.800 --> 39:33.679
No. No, there's no sign of him.

39:33.680 --> 39:36.279
Ma'am, he's just arrived. Ma'am.

39:36.280 --> 39:38.239
What the hell's going on here?

39:38.240 --> 39:39.999
- Superintendent Hastings?
- Yeah.

39:40.000 --> 39:42.159
DI Michelle Brandyce, AC-3.

39:42.160 --> 39:43.919
Are you going to tell me what's going on?

39:43.920 --> 39:46.519
Sir, Detective Chief Superintendent
Carmichael asked me to

39:46.520 --> 39:49.519
keep track of your movements. I was
informed you'd absconded from AC-12.

39:49.520 --> 39:52.319
"Absconded"? Well, that's rich. Now,
I'd just like to get to my room,

39:52.320 --> 39:53.439
if it's all the same to you.

39:53.440 --> 39:55.959
Sir, may I ask what's the purpose
of your visit here?

39:55.960 --> 39:58.479
A hot bath and a change of clothes,
for Christ's sake!

39:58.480 --> 39:59.999
Right, Constable, stand aside.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.999
Sir, we've made arrangements
to question you.

40:02.000 --> 40:05.079
Could I please ask you to accompany
me to Decker Avenue Police Station?

40:05.080 --> 40:07.719
Between you and me and the gatepost,
DI Brandyce,

40:07.720 --> 40:09.239
my patience is wearing a bit thin.

40:09.240 --> 40:11.519
Right, Constable.
Stand aside, that's an order.

40:11.520 --> 40:13.919
Sir, I've asked you politely
to come to Decker Avenue.

40:13.920 --> 40:15.799
Yeah. And I politely declined.

40:15.800 --> 40:18.319
In that case, sir, you give me
no choice but to arrest you.

40:18.320 --> 40:19.799
On what grounds?

40:19.800 --> 40:23.079
As I'm sure you know, sir, under
the Police and Criminal Evidence Act

40:23.080 --> 40:28.439
1984, Code G, Subsection 2.9, I have
the lawful power to arrest you

40:28.440 --> 40:31.639
to further the prompt and effective
investigation of an offence.

40:31.640 --> 40:33.639
What offence?
Wanting to get in to my room

40:33.640 --> 40:34.908
to get a clean set of clothes?

40:34.933 --> 40:36.519
Sir, I strongly recommend you cooperate.

40:36.520 --> 40:38.380
Yeah, well, state the offence.

40:38.920 --> 40:39.999
Edward Hastings,

40:40.000 --> 40:43.519
you are under arrest on suspicion
of misconduct in a public office.

40:43.520 --> 40:46.039
You do not have to say anything,
but it may harm your defence

40:46.040 --> 40:49.719
if you do not mention, when questioned,
something you later rely on in court.

40:49.720 --> 40:52.100
Anything you do say may be
used in evidence.

41:19.520 --> 41:20.800
DS Arnott.

41:24.499 --> 41:25.539
Thanks.

41:26.913 --> 41:29.233
- You all right?
- All right.

41:30.160 --> 41:33.759
It's usually you Sam calls.
Everything all right with you two?

41:33.760 --> 41:35.119
Not really.

41:35.120 --> 41:37.839
That's a shame. I thought
you were getting back together.

41:37.840 --> 41:39.319
We're not.

41:39.800 --> 41:41.160
Sorry, mate.

41:44.080 --> 41:45.959
Thanks for the call.

41:45.960 --> 41:47.680
- You all right?
- All right.

41:49.040 --> 41:50.559
Workmen were processing this scrap

41:50.560 --> 41:53.039
when they accidentally
disturbed the body bag.

41:53.040 --> 41:55.039
We've examined CCTV

41:55.040 --> 41:58.040
and an OCG vehicle was seen in
the immediate vicinity.

42:00.673 --> 42:01.873
Open it up.

42:03.393 --> 42:05.753
I'm going to cut into
the seal of the bag.

42:06.440 --> 42:08.519
- If this is Corbett...
- Yeah.

42:08.520 --> 42:10.720
Take pictures of each stage
of the process.

42:19.800 --> 42:22.300
There is a strong smell
from inside the bag.

42:23.760 --> 42:26.400
I can see various evidence
of dismemberment.

42:27.400 --> 42:29.479
Jesus Christ.

42:29.480 --> 42:31.160
No, it's OK. You carry on.

42:36.680 --> 42:38.760
- You OK, mate?
- No.

42:40.800 --> 42:42.200
I'm sorry.

42:44.080 --> 42:45.880
No way he deserved that.

43:09.600 --> 43:11.879
What if he did blow Corbett's cover?

43:11.880 --> 43:13.400
Doesn't bear thinking about.

43:18.360 --> 43:20.901
DCS Carmichael asked me
to pass on a message.

43:20.926 --> 43:21.999
Yeah?

43:22.000 --> 43:23.839
Given the possible conflict of interest,

43:23.840 --> 43:26.759
it protects all parties for you both
to stay out of the building.

43:26.760 --> 43:28.520
If she needs you, we'll call you in.

43:35.720 --> 43:38.260
Come on, mate.
There's nothing we can do here.

43:56.560 --> 43:57.960
Thank you, as you were.

44:30.640 --> 44:32.919
Anti-corruption Unit 3 interview
of Edward Hastings,

44:32.920 --> 44:34.439
in the presence of his solicitor,

44:34.440 --> 44:36.639
by Detective Chief
Superintendent Carmichael,

44:36.640 --> 44:40.039
Detective Inspector Brandyce
and Police Sergeant Tranter,

44:40.040 --> 44:44.639
at 17:30 on the 14th of March 2019.

44:44.640 --> 44:47.479
For the DIR, can you please
identify yourself?

44:47.480 --> 44:49.199
Superintendent Hastings.

44:49.200 --> 44:50.940
You remain under caution.

44:51.800 --> 44:54.759
Mr Hastings, what's your current
permanent residence?

44:54.760 --> 44:57.780
My rank is Superintendent
and you will address me as such.

45:00.920 --> 45:03.220
I'm very happy to address you
as Superintendent.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.840
And in respect of your responses,
"ma'am" will suffice.

45:09.600 --> 45:13.100
I do not have a permanent
residence, ma'am.

45:13.720 --> 45:16.319
Why is that, Superintendent?

45:16.320 --> 45:18.199
Well, because my wife and I
sold the house.

45:18.200 --> 45:20.799
I am temporarily holed up in a hotel

45:20.800 --> 45:24.719
whilst seeking a more
permanent accommodation.

45:24.720 --> 45:27.559
And this would be
the Edge Park Hotel room?

45:27.560 --> 45:29.839
Yes. Room 336.

45:29.840 --> 45:31.559
Document four in your folders.

45:31.560 --> 45:35.039
Document four relates to a search
of Room 336 at the Edge Park Hotel,

45:35.040 --> 45:37.039
today, on the 14th of March.

45:37.040 --> 45:39.119
PS Tranter will show you
image nine on screen.

45:39.120 --> 45:41.079
If you prefer, you can refer
to your folder.

45:41.080 --> 45:43.639
Image nine shows item reference MB-1.

45:43.640 --> 45:45.799
Superintendent Hastings,
do you recognise item MB-1?

45:45.800 --> 45:47.679
I do, ma'am.

45:47.680 --> 45:49.580
Image ten on screen, please.

45:50.160 --> 45:52.919
Image ten shows item reference MB-2.

45:52.920 --> 45:55.119
Item reference MB-2 is
a collection of banknotes

45:55.120 --> 45:57.380
in the value of £50,000.

45:58.360 --> 46:01.359
Do you recognise item MB-2,
Superintendent Hastings?

46:01.360 --> 46:02.799
I do, ma'am.

46:02.800 --> 46:05.559
Can you account for this
substantial sum of cash?

46:05.560 --> 46:07.679
I was in the process of returning
this cash to

46:07.680 --> 46:10.039
Retired Detective
Chief Inspector Mark Moffatt.

46:10.040 --> 46:14.239
Moffatt forwarded the cash to me
using false pretences.

46:14.240 --> 46:15.999
DI Brandyce.

46:16.000 --> 46:20.359
Document 24 in your folders,
statement given to PS Tranter

46:20.360 --> 46:23.319
by Mark Moffatt today, the 14th of March.

46:23.320 --> 46:26.039
In his statement, Mr Moffatt claims
he only provided further documents

46:26.040 --> 46:29.079
relating to the Kettle Bell project
and nothing else.

46:29.080 --> 46:31.119
Well, the man is a barefaced liar!

46:31.120 --> 46:32.680
I can't bear shouting.

46:34.560 --> 46:36.639
You really ought to try and be more calm.

46:36.640 --> 46:40.079
Yeah, well, I'll be more calm when
I'm not listening to a pack of lies.

46:40.080 --> 46:42.959
Did you even manage to check
the bank notes for fingerprints?

46:42.960 --> 46:46.439
Funnily enough, I have run
an investigation before.

46:46.440 --> 46:48.119
Moffatt provided elimination prints-

46:48.120 --> 46:49.730
they weren't detected on the bank notes.

46:49.755 --> 46:50.999
He'd be too smart for that.

46:51.000 --> 46:52.439
What about the envelope?

46:52.440 --> 46:56.140
Prints were detected, but he doesn't
deny handling the envelope.

46:56.680 --> 46:58.879
Said cash, why did you hold on to it?

46:58.880 --> 47:01.180
As I said, I intended to return it.

47:01.760 --> 47:02.882
"Intended"?

47:02.907 --> 47:04.719
Yeah, well, I didn't open the
package immediately, ma'am.

47:04.720 --> 47:08.040
But the minute I spotted the cash,
I called Moffatt straight away.

47:09.760 --> 47:13.319
How would you describe receiving
50 grand in a brown envelope

47:13.320 --> 47:16.640
when you're the head
of an anti-corruption unit?

47:19.680 --> 47:20.880
Suspicious.

47:22.440 --> 47:23.460
Mm.

47:24.527 --> 47:26.447
There, you see, we're agreeing.

47:27.947 --> 47:29.620
This is much better, isn't it?

47:31.772 --> 47:33.092
"Suspicious."

47:35.000 --> 47:37.399
Look, it was a complicated arrangement.

47:37.400 --> 47:40.679
It was an advance on funds that was
due to me further down the line.

47:40.680 --> 47:43.799
And the fact that it was in cash,
what did that make you think?

47:43.800 --> 47:46.759
Like I said, it didn't sit right.

47:46.760 --> 47:49.220
Possibly someone was trying
to hide the payment?

47:49.880 --> 47:51.420
That's possible.

47:52.080 --> 47:55.519
- DI Brandyce.
- Document 17 in your folders.

47:55.520 --> 47:57.399
We've been given access to the accounts

47:57.400 --> 48:00.119
of Kettle Bell Property Partners.

48:00.120 --> 48:05.000
We are unable to detect the sum of
£50,000 credited to Edward Hastings.

48:06.520 --> 48:08.480
Yeah, well, um...

48:09.920 --> 48:12.479
Moffatt must have been
keeping it off the books.

48:12.480 --> 48:15.719
Well, bearing in mind that's your
version of events, Superintendent,

48:15.720 --> 48:17.919
Moffatt denies furnishing you
with the cash.

48:17.920 --> 48:19.839
Yeah, and I told you the man's a liar!

48:19.840 --> 48:21.879
My client is telling the truth.

48:21.880 --> 48:25.479
He strenuously denies
Mr Moffatt's account.

48:25.480 --> 48:28.719
Alternatively, hiding financial
transactions on that scale,

48:28.720 --> 48:30.672
is that something you would normally do?

48:30.697 --> 48:31.904
Absolutely not.

48:32.960 --> 48:34.839
DI Brandyce.

48:34.840 --> 48:38.279
As part of our inquiry under police
developed vetting procedures,

48:38.280 --> 48:39.759
we've been able to inspect

48:39.760 --> 48:42.079
Superintendent Hastings'
financial records.

48:42.080 --> 48:45.959
Documents 32 to 38 in your folders.

48:45.960 --> 48:50.119
Now, in 2014, an allegation was made

48:50.120 --> 48:54.519
by an officer under investigation
by AC-12, DI Lindsay Denton,

48:54.520 --> 48:56.199
who had fraudulently obtained access

48:56.200 --> 48:59.079
to Superintendent Hastings'
financial records.

48:59.080 --> 49:01.399
At the time, Superintendent Hastings

49:01.400 --> 49:03.639
answered the allegations in writing

49:03.640 --> 49:05.439
and the inquiry was closed,

49:05.440 --> 49:08.519
as Denton's evidence
had been obtained unlawfully.

49:08.520 --> 49:11.039
No, no, no. It was because
there was no case to answer!

49:11.040 --> 49:13.674
Our examination of your accounts
since 2014

49:13.675 --> 49:15.074
shows a pattern of increasing debts,

49:15.075 --> 49:17.439
each time rectified by the sale of
assets.

49:17.440 --> 49:20.439
Is that why you sold the family
home, Superintendent?

49:20.440 --> 49:22.479
I don't have to answer that question.

49:22.480 --> 49:24.754
You don't really need to answer
any of these questions,

49:24.755 --> 49:27.080
but that's not going to help you, is it?

49:28.340 --> 49:33.035
So far, we have £50,000
hidden in your hotel room

49:33.036 --> 49:34.400
and a history of insolvency.

49:34.401 --> 49:36.559
I think it's in your best interest
to account for this,

49:36.560 --> 49:41.719
otherwise... my imagination
might start running away with me.

49:41.720 --> 49:44.759
I mean, there's lots of reasons why
a bloke might get into debt,

49:44.760 --> 49:46.399
I hardly dare mention them.

49:46.400 --> 49:47.820
Gambling.

49:48.780 --> 49:50.639
Drink. Drugs.

49:50.980 --> 49:52.157
Sex.

49:52.158 --> 49:54.239
Look, it was a bad investment.

49:54.240 --> 49:55.679
You trust somebody.

49:55.680 --> 49:57.399
All I was trying to do

49:57.400 --> 50:02.180
was to secure a comfortable
retirement for myself and my wife.

50:02.800 --> 50:04.479
I'm sorry to hear that...

50:04.480 --> 50:07.848
...but it is your duty to
declare these losses.

50:07.849 --> 50:10.374
In your position, as head
of an anti-corruption unit,

50:10.375 --> 50:12.067
you are uniquely vulnerable

50:12.068 --> 50:14.390
to attempts of
bribery and, or, blackmail.

50:14.391 --> 50:15.711
Agreed?

50:17.360 --> 50:19.010
- Yes.
- There, you see?

50:19.011 --> 50:20.119
We're agreeing again.

50:20.120 --> 50:22.100
This is how I like to work.

50:22.960 --> 50:24.919
These proceedings
were initially triggered

50:24.920 --> 50:26.879
by allegations of
professional misconduct,

50:26.880 --> 50:28.239
let's move on to examine those.

50:28.240 --> 50:29.639
I'd be most grateful if you would.

50:29.640 --> 50:31.614
I'd like to look at your
professional activities

50:31.615 --> 50:33.119
on the 12th of March.

50:33.120 --> 50:36.199
Have you had an opportunity to
review your diary for that day?

50:36.200 --> 50:37.519
I have, ma'am.

50:37.520 --> 50:40.359
- Please feel free to refer to it.
- Thank you.

50:40.620 --> 50:42.599
Did you make a visit
to Blackthorn Prison?

50:42.600 --> 50:43.919
I did.

50:43.920 --> 50:45.679
What was the purpose of that visit?

50:45.680 --> 50:50.346
To gather and harvest information on
the organised crime group

50:50.347 --> 50:52.959
that we were in the process of
investigating.

50:52.960 --> 50:55.399
We have a copy
of the Governor-authorised police

50:55.400 --> 50:57.879
visit to Blackthorn Prison
on the 12th of March.

50:57.880 --> 51:01.879
Is that your name recorded at 1700 hours?

51:01.880 --> 51:03.159
Yes, ma'am, it is.

51:03.160 --> 51:05.319
And who is recorded as
the prisoner that you visited?

51:05.320 --> 51:06.559
That would be Lee Banks.

51:06.560 --> 51:09.258
- Did you speak with Banks on the 12th?
- I did, ma'am.

51:09.259 --> 51:10.892
What was the content of that
conversation?

51:10.893 --> 51:13.799
Well, I questioned
Banks on the personnel of the OCG

51:13.800 --> 51:17.399
and other details that might be
useful to our inquiry.

51:17.400 --> 51:19.439
Was the conversation recorded?

51:20.106 --> 51:21.586
No, ma'am.

51:22.120 --> 51:24.079
Was it witnessed?

51:24.080 --> 51:25.600
No, ma'am.

51:37.960 --> 51:41.319
PS Tranter interviewed Lee Banks.

51:41.320 --> 51:43.599
Lee Banks refused to cooperate
in our inquiry

51:43.600 --> 51:46.199
and answered "no comment"
to all the questions put to him.

51:46.200 --> 51:48.279
There's no corroboration
of your statement,

51:48.280 --> 51:49.536
Superintendent Hastings, is there?

51:49.537 --> 51:53.679
No, look,
Lee Banks is a hardened criminal.

51:53.680 --> 51:55.879
It's like getting blood out of a stone.

51:55.880 --> 51:57.599
He talked to you?

51:58.067 --> 51:59.707
- A little.
- Why?

52:00.440 --> 52:01.639
What do you mean?

52:01.640 --> 52:03.959
You just stated that Lee Banks
isn't very forthcoming.

52:03.960 --> 52:06.160
What induced him to speak to you?

52:07.600 --> 52:10.639
I am the superintendent of the team
that got him banged up

52:10.640 --> 52:13.559
and put behind bars,
so, if he helps me with my inquiry,

52:13.560 --> 52:15.714
I'll put a word in to the court

52:15.715 --> 52:18.000
so they can take into account
his cooperation

52:18.001 --> 52:19.119
when it comes to sentencing.

52:19.120 --> 52:22.000
There really isn't anything very
clever about that.

52:23.160 --> 52:26.559
But visiting a prisoner,
with no witness, no recording,

52:26.560 --> 52:29.940
that is less clever.

52:37.960 --> 52:40.520
For the DIR,
the interviewee is not responding.

52:41.840 --> 52:45.079
What specifically did Banks
reveal to you about the OCG

52:45.080 --> 52:47.159
that helped you with your inquiry?

52:47.160 --> 52:50.547
Only that the shots were being
called by John Clayton,

52:50.548 --> 52:53.705
aka John Corbett, and one Lisa McQueen.

52:53.706 --> 52:55.239
Let's turn to Corbett and McQueen.

52:55.240 --> 52:57.786
Your unit has been attempting,
without much success,

52:57.787 --> 53:00.279
it has to be said, to apprehend Corbett.

53:00.280 --> 53:03.039
When was the last confirmed
contact with Corbett?

53:03.040 --> 53:05.399
Well, I'm sorry,
ma'am, I'd have to check.

53:05.400 --> 53:06.919
We've checked.

53:06.920 --> 53:08.839
It was the 12th of March,

53:09.380 --> 53:14.300
a few hours before you visited
Lee Banks in Blackthorn Prison.

53:18.400 --> 53:20.079
Now, turning to Lisa McQueen.

53:20.080 --> 53:22.319
She was interviewed by your leading
investigators

53:22.320 --> 53:24.519
into Operation Pear Tree,
DI Fleming and DS Arnott.

53:24.520 --> 53:27.159
We've been able to listen to the
DIR of that interview.

53:27.160 --> 53:29.479
Reading from the transcript, McQueen,

53:29.480 --> 53:31.959
"We got a tip off there was
a rat in the unit.

53:31.960 --> 53:33.559
"He must have lost his bottle."

53:33.560 --> 53:35.719
"He" being Corbett.

53:35.720 --> 53:38.679
DI Fleming,
"Where did the tip-off come from?"

53:38.680 --> 53:41.159
McQueen, "It came from out
of Blackthorn."

53:41.160 --> 53:44.237
Superintendent Hastings, did you
reveal sensitive information

53:44.238 --> 53:47.839
to Lee Banks regarding DS John
Corbett's undercover operation

53:47.840 --> 53:49.319
with the OCG?

53:49.320 --> 53:50.879
No, I did not.

53:50.880 --> 53:53.959
What would have been
the consequences, if you had?

53:53.960 --> 53:57.799
Well, I think Corbett would have
considered his position

53:57.800 --> 54:01.599
and sought refuge in the nearest
police station.

54:01.600 --> 54:03.720
Unless the OCG got to him first.

54:06.920 --> 54:09.239
For the DIR,
the interviewee is not responding.

54:09.240 --> 54:12.409
I'd now like to present evidence
from a forensic recovery

54:12.410 --> 54:17.060
at... McDade & Company breakers yard.

54:17.640 --> 54:21.079
Images 67 to 72 show us
a body bag being forensically

54:21.080 --> 54:25.359
recovered from McDade & Company
breakers yard.

54:25.360 --> 54:29.519
The body bag contains body parts
relating to a property developer

54:29.520 --> 54:32.040
who's been a missing person since 2012.

54:36.000 --> 54:37.980
Miss Jacqueline Laverty.

54:39.800 --> 54:42.020
Do you recognise Miss Laverty?

54:43.600 --> 54:45.239
Hmm, yes, I do.

54:45.240 --> 54:49.159
She was the mistress of a police officer

54:49.160 --> 54:52.439
who was under investigation,
DCI Tony Gates.

54:52.440 --> 54:56.119
Mm. Gates stated that he was present
when Miss Laverty was murdered

54:56.120 --> 54:57.593
by members of the OCG,

54:57.594 --> 54:59.685
so it's highly likely,
wouldn't you agree,

54:59.686 --> 55:02.920
that this body bag was dumped by the OCG?

55:05.840 --> 55:07.679
Yeah. Yes.

55:07.680 --> 55:09.759
Also present in the body bag

55:09.760 --> 55:14.799
were the remains relating to an IC1
male aged approximately 40 years.

55:14.800 --> 55:17.959
A postmortem has revealed that the victim

55:17.960 --> 55:20.719
died of exsanguination
following a knife wound to the neck.

55:20.720 --> 55:22.639
Fingerprints and DNA

55:22.640 --> 55:27.920
match IDENT1 elimination samples
of a serving police officer.

55:30.440 --> 55:32.980
Detective Sergeant John Corbett.

55:35.400 --> 55:36.921
Superintendent Edward Hastings,

55:36.922 --> 55:39.359
I believe we have demonstrated you
had motive

55:39.360 --> 55:40.959
to want Corbett dead...

55:40.960 --> 55:43.453
- No...
- ..and the opportunity and means

55:43.454 --> 55:45.919
to disclose to Lee Banks that he
was an undercover police officer.

55:45.920 --> 55:47.199
No. Never!

55:47.200 --> 55:49.389
It is clear to me that the
threshold test has been passed

55:49.390 --> 55:51.919
and therefore it is my lawful
right to arrest you

55:51.920 --> 55:54.039
on suspicion of conspiracy
to murder John Corbett.

55:54.040 --> 55:55.239
No, no, no!

55:55.240 --> 55:58.199
You will be held in custody while we
gather further evidence against you.

55:58.200 --> 56:01.119
No! What is happening here?
I am being framed!

56:01.120 --> 56:02.559
Interview terminated.

56:02.560 --> 56:04.480
Look, I am not bent!

56:36.320 --> 56:37.879
- Thank you, Tina.
- Ma'am.

56:37.880 --> 56:40.359
- I assume you've been informed.
- Yes, ma'am.

56:40.360 --> 56:42.959
You did the right thing, pointing
the finger at your own Gaffer.

56:42.960 --> 56:44.319
It takes guts, integrity.

56:44.320 --> 56:46.999
It tells me that I can
count on the two of you.
