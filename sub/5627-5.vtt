Correctional Treatment Facility
LORTON, VIRGINIA

01:11.170 --> 01:13.170
When we spoke last,
you were talking about the summer

01:13.170 --> 01:15.000
that you ran away from home.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.750
Why don't we start with that?

01:16.750 --> 01:18.120
Uh, sure.

01:19.960 --> 01:25.120
I wasn't really sure what was left for me
back at home.

01:26.210 --> 01:29.960
Um, I felt I had learned
all that I could there.

01:29.960 --> 01:32.670
-Mmm.
-Um, it was time to, uh,

01:32.670 --> 01:33.920
broaden my classroom.

01:34.540 --> 01:37.330
And that's when I met Susie Johnson.

01:37.880 --> 01:40.500
The first of your victims?ENNIS: Yes.

01:40.500 --> 01:42.960
What did it feel like
when you were killing her?

01:42.960 --> 01:44.620
Nothing special.

01:44.620 --> 01:47.080
I have trouble believing that, Leonard.

01:47.080 --> 01:48.460
How come?

01:49.250 --> 01:51.460
Well, you killed 14 of them.

01:51.460 --> 01:53.420
That you know of.

01:53.420 --> 01:57.080
My point is that something
drove you to keep killing,

01:57.080 --> 01:59.750
so you must have felt something.

02:00.080 --> 02:02.920
It was just a thing I did, you know?

02:03.580 --> 02:05.500
People do things every day.

02:11.960 --> 02:13.080
Hey.

02:13.960 --> 02:15.250
I, um...

02:16.000 --> 02:18.000
I didn't think you'd still be up.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.580
Still up.

02:20.460 --> 02:21.580
Did you eat?

02:22.040 --> 02:23.830
-No.
-Mmm.

02:23.830 --> 02:25.210
Me neither.

02:25.210 --> 02:29.330
Why don't I make us some
huevos rancheros?

02:29.330 --> 02:30.420
Tara.

02:30.420 --> 02:33.120
Don't worry. I will dial back
the jalapenos this time

02:33.120 --> 02:35.460
so I don't blow off the top of your head
like Mount St. Helens.

02:35.460 --> 02:37.750
Stop. Just...

02:38.210 --> 02:40.040
Stop.

02:45.790 --> 02:48.960
Look, I'm sorry I'm late, Doug.

02:49.380 --> 02:52.540
All right? We just got on a roll
and I lost track of time.

02:52.540 --> 02:55.040
It's research, okay? It's necessary.

02:55.420 --> 02:57.250
Wouldn't want to get in the way
of what's necessary.

03:00.710 --> 03:02.960
Look, Doug.

03:03.920 --> 03:06.080
These interviews with Ennis,

03:06.080 --> 03:09.040
these late nights,
this is important work.

03:09.040 --> 03:11.080
All right? It's meaningful work.

03:11.080 --> 03:15.790
I am trying to take serial killer
profiling protocol to the next level.

03:15.790 --> 03:18.420
You're more interested in a guy

03:18.420 --> 03:20.960
who killed a bunch of little kids
than you are in me.

03:25.460 --> 03:27.080
Um...

03:27.080 --> 03:29.620
I have to be in to the office
first thing in the morning,

03:29.620 --> 03:31.670
so could we talk about this at dinner
tomorrow night?

03:31.670 --> 03:33.500
There's nothing more to talk about.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.620
I'm going back to San Francisco.

03:42.330 --> 03:43.460
What?

03:43.460 --> 03:45.420
My flight leaves tomorrow afternoon.

03:45.420 --> 03:47.880
And you're just announcing this?

03:48.210 --> 03:51.040
Things haven't been good
with us for a while now.

03:53.500 --> 03:57.380
Okay, uh, I thought the point
of a relationship

03:57.380 --> 04:00.170
is that you work through your problems,

04:00.170 --> 04:03.460
not hop on a plane and leave.

04:06.750 --> 04:09.460
I can see I was mistaken.

04:11.210 --> 04:16.000
Thank you for keeping it real
for me, Doug.

04:19.960 --> 04:21.620
Have a nice flight.

04:27.210 --> 04:31.170
So Yogi Berra arrives at spring training
and the equipment manager says to him,

04:31.170 --> 04:32.580
"What size cap do you wear?"

04:32.580 --> 04:36.710
And Yogi says, "I don't know,
I'm not in shape yet."

04:36.710 --> 04:40.120
-Uh-huh?
-That's it. That's the joke.

04:40.120 --> 04:42.420
But, uh, studies have shown
that dimensional changes

04:42.420 --> 04:45.540
in the human head actually can fluctuate,
especially in the third decade of life.

04:45.540 --> 04:47.830
Morning, guys. How do I look?

04:47.830 --> 04:49.080
You look great.

04:49.080 --> 04:52.000
Went on a diet last night,
lost 185 pounds.

04:54.040 --> 04:55.290
What do we have?

04:55.290 --> 04:57.040
Okay, you know the phrase
"art imitates life"?

04:57.040 --> 04:59.460
Uh, this is like that, but a dead version.

04:59.460 --> 05:01.080
This happened last night in Detroit.

05:01.080 --> 05:03.750
And if I can direct your attention
to the signature...

05:04.540 --> 05:06.710
-Is that Morpheus

05:06.710 --> 05:10.290
He's a prolific street artist who's been
active since the summer of 2007.

05:10.290 --> 05:12.790
He began using primarily stencils
and wheat paste, but in recent years

05:12.790 --> 05:15.120
he's moved on to more site-specific
installation work.

05:15.120 --> 05:17.420
The kicker? No one knows
who Morpheus really is.

05:17.420 --> 05:19.540
Like that British graffiti artist,
what's-his-face?

05:19.540 --> 05:20.920
That's the one.

05:20.920 --> 05:22.920
This is the only known
photograph of Morpheus.

05:22.920 --> 05:24.920
This was taken seven years ago
in Los Angeles.

05:24.920 --> 05:26.920
No, that's no help.
That could be anyone.

05:26.920 --> 05:28.330
Do we know who the victim is?

05:28.330 --> 05:30.380
Yeah. Russell Pearson.
He's a community activist

05:30.380 --> 05:32.000
who's been in the local news a lot

05:32.000 --> 05:34.120
for opposing a controversial
development project

05:34.120 --> 05:35.880
that's supposed to revitalize
the downtown area.

05:35.880 --> 05:37.960
What's so controversial
about the project?

05:37.960 --> 05:41.620
Gentrification. Lower income residents
are displaced by luxury condos.

05:41.620 --> 05:45.290
Good bet the only thing being revitalized
are the developers' bank accounts.

05:45.290 --> 05:47.830
Morpheus has always sort of been
the voice of the underdog.

05:47.830 --> 05:50.540
I'd assume that he and Pearson
were on the same side of this issue.

05:50.540 --> 05:52.880
Normally, yes, but Pearson,
three days ago,

05:52.880 --> 05:55.580
was in the news again
for all the wrong reasons.

05:55.580 --> 05:58.380
He was accused of taking
bribes from the very developers

05:58.380 --> 05:59.880
he was organizing against.

05:59.880 --> 06:01.670
So this could be a dose of street justice.

06:01.670 --> 06:04.290
Has this Morpheus ever committed
an act of violence before?

06:04.290 --> 06:06.670
No, he's always advocated
for civil disobedience.

06:06.670 --> 06:08.460
Well, how do we know it's even him?

06:08.460 --> 06:10.960
Morgan's right. Morpheus
may be beating the war drum,

06:10.960 --> 06:12.290
but so far that's all he's done.

06:12.290 --> 06:14.290
Regardless, tensions
are already high in Detroit,

06:14.290 --> 06:17.330
and this is only gonna make things worse.
Wheels up in 20.

07:26.580 --> 07:30.290
"Ghosts were created
when the first man woke in the night."

07:30.290 --> 07:31.380
J.M. Barrie.

07:32.580 --> 07:34.500
Between his activism and bribe-taking,

07:34.500 --> 07:36.420
Russell Pearson had
no shortage of enemies.

07:36.880 --> 07:39.080
Well, Morpheus isn't
too subtle with his symbolism.

07:39.080 --> 07:41.250
Stick your nose in the cookie jar,
you pay the price.

07:41.250 --> 07:43.250
How long has Morpheus been in Detroit?

07:43.250 --> 07:45.000
Oh, I can answer that question.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.000
Morpheus first popped up
in the city six weeks ago.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.380
I'm sending video
to your tablet right now.

07:54.250 --> 07:56.620
A vehicle as barbecue. What's that about?

07:56.620 --> 07:58.960
There was a heatwave
in Detroit in August

07:58.960 --> 08:01.750
and a homeless woman and her child
locked themselves in a car to sleep

08:01.750 --> 08:03.210
and died of dehydration.

08:03.210 --> 08:06.380
Morpheus has done two more pieces.
The second one he took credit for,

08:06.380 --> 08:09.380
but it was dismantled by a rival artist
before anyone could see it.

08:09.380 --> 08:10.880
Didn't realize it was that cutthroat.

08:10.880 --> 08:13.000
Yeah, competition among
street artists is intense.

08:13.000 --> 08:14.920
Well, according to this,

08:14.920 --> 08:17.330
Morpheus has a website
where he always posts his work.

08:17.330 --> 08:19.330
Yeah, that's right.
He doesn't post any comments.

08:19.330 --> 08:21.330
It's through a proxy server,
so it's impossible to trace.

08:21.330 --> 08:23.670
He took credit for the first three
pieces in Detroit,

08:23.670 --> 08:25.960
but there's been nothing on the website
about the Russell Pearson murder.

08:25.960 --> 08:27.330
Because he didn't do it?

08:27.330 --> 08:29.080
-Or because this time it involved murder.
-

08:29.080 --> 08:30.380
-Oh, no.-What is it, Garcia?

08:30.380 --> 08:33.750
Uh, something is terribly wrong.
A child's been abducted in Detroit.

08:33.750 --> 08:36.880
Corinne Wallace, 8-month-old daughter
of Stuart and Katherine Wallace.

08:36.880 --> 08:39.750
Stuart Wallace is one of the developers
behind the urban renovation project.

08:39.750 --> 08:41.790
And there was graffiti
and Morpheus' signature

08:41.790 --> 08:43.170
on the walls of the baby's nursery.

08:43.170 --> 08:44.750
Has there been a ransom demand?

08:44.750 --> 08:46.540
I don't know. It just happened
like 30 minutes ago.

08:46.540 --> 08:48.830
All right, when we land, Dave,
you and Lewis go to the abduction site.

08:48.830 --> 08:51.670
Morgan, see if you can locate the
rival artist who took down Morpheus' work.

08:51.670 --> 08:53.120
Reid and I will go to the P.D.,

08:53.120 --> 08:55.460
we'll contact the regional CARD team
and get set up there. And Garcia...

08:55.460 --> 08:56.540
Yes, sir.

08:56.540 --> 08:58.500
Your sole job is to find out
the identity of Morpheus.

08:58.500 --> 09:00.000
Use every resource you have available.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.170
Finding him is our best
chance of finding the child.

09:06.750 --> 09:08.790
DETROIT, MICHIGAN

09:08.790 --> 09:10.670
We're grateful for your assistance.

09:10.670 --> 09:13.540
We've got an AMBER Alert
and tip line set up.

09:13.540 --> 09:16.420
And the bureau's child abduction
rapid deployment team are on their way.

09:16.420 --> 09:19.000
Got the video from the baby monitor
cued up in my office.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.170
Thank you.

09:20.170 --> 09:22.880
I understand both parents were home
at the time of the abduction?

09:22.880 --> 09:24.420
That's right. The maid, too.

09:24.420 --> 09:26.710
And no one in the neighborhood
saw anything unusual?

09:26.710 --> 09:28.670
Nah. Happened in Grosse Pointe,

09:28.670 --> 09:30.920
where the homes tend to be
on large secluded lots.

09:30.920 --> 09:33.710
In this case, the family being wealthy
works against us.

09:34.380 --> 09:37.040
Okay, our guy comes in now.

09:38.040 --> 09:40.000
Creepy how he plays with the baby.

09:42.830 --> 09:47.500
We did a photographic comparison
of the signatures at both crime scenes.

09:47.500 --> 09:50.540
They appear to be authentic.
It looks like Morpheus is our guy.

09:56.290 --> 09:58.790
I was in my study right down the hall.

09:59.170 --> 10:00.500
Right there, 30 feet away.

10:00.960 --> 10:04.250
I know it's hard, Mr. Wallace.
We appreciate you talking to us.

10:04.960 --> 10:07.790
If we could, we'd also like
to talk to your wife as well.

10:08.420 --> 10:11.500
Katherine's upstairs in the nursery.
The police said it was okay.

10:12.290 --> 10:14.250
If anything's happened
to our little girl...

10:14.250 --> 10:16.580
-You can't blame yourself.
-The hell I can't.

10:16.580 --> 10:18.920
I should have seen
something like this coming.

10:18.920 --> 10:21.380
Why

10:22.080 --> 10:25.290
Not her specifically,
but my property was vandalized

10:25.290 --> 10:26.880
and then Pearson turned up murdered.

10:26.880 --> 10:30.540
I should've moved my family out of town,
you know, hired more security, something.

10:30.540 --> 10:32.080
Wait, your house was vandalized?

10:32.460 --> 10:35.120
My business. I've got
a storage facility downtown

10:35.120 --> 10:38.420
and that guy they call Morpheus
put graffiti all over it last week.

10:38.420 --> 10:40.330
Even put it on his website.

10:40.330 --> 10:42.750
Who is he, anyway, Morpheus?

10:44.000 --> 10:46.080
How can somebody just not exist?

10:46.080 --> 10:47.750
He does exist.

10:48.170 --> 10:49.620
And we're gonna find him.

11:03.830 --> 11:06.250
The maid said the doors
to the house were locked.

11:06.250 --> 11:08.120
That's right. They're always locked.

11:08.830 --> 11:11.170
Mrs. Wallace, I know this is difficult,

11:11.170 --> 11:16.420
but did you hear or see
anything unusual?

11:17.580 --> 11:19.040
Corinne's giraffe.

11:19.830 --> 11:21.250
Ma'am?

11:21.250 --> 11:23.080
Corinne's giraffe. It isn't here.

11:23.080 --> 11:24.540
She's right.

11:24.540 --> 11:27.290
It's always in her crib.
It's her favorite toy.

11:27.290 --> 11:28.920
He took it.

11:28.920 --> 11:31.420
-That man took Corinne's toy.
-Oh, honey.

11:32.420 --> 11:34.540
He wouldn't do that
if he was gonna hurt her, would he?

11:35.000 --> 11:36.750
Take her favorite toy?

11:36.750 --> 11:38.620
It's a hopeful sign, Mrs. Wallace.

11:39.420 --> 11:41.500
You should try to get some rest.

11:41.500 --> 11:43.040
Come on, sweetheart.

11:46.380 --> 11:47.540
What have we got?

11:47.540 --> 11:49.120
I've been working with Garcia
to track the locations

11:49.120 --> 11:51.120
of Morpheus' street art
over the past eight years.

11:51.120 --> 11:53.250
This is a geographic
timeline I put together.

11:53.250 --> 11:54.420
Is there a pattern?

11:54.420 --> 11:57.670
Not really. He mainly just criss-crosses
between Los Angeles and New York.

11:57.670 --> 11:59.620
He's never really in one place
for a very long time.

11:59.620 --> 12:01.250
There is a higher concentration
of activity

12:01.250 --> 12:02.620
along the Gulf Coast of Florida, though.

12:02.620 --> 12:04.420
That could be some sort of home base.

12:04.880 --> 12:06.170
What are you looking for?

12:06.170 --> 12:08.120
Well, I noticed in Morpheus' early work

12:08.120 --> 12:10.540
there's a synthetic cubist spatial
construction reminiscent of de Kooning.

12:10.540 --> 12:12.670
So you're thinking he had
some formal art education.

12:12.670 --> 12:14.750
Exactly. And I'm hoping
to be able to track it

12:14.750 --> 12:16.790
to a specific university
or school of training.

12:16.790 --> 12:18.040
Good.

12:18.040 --> 12:19.460
Well, it took a while,
but I finally tracked down

12:19.460 --> 12:22.460
the artist who took credit
for dismantling Morpheus' work.

12:22.460 --> 12:25.710
Markus Ivey.
He's on his way in for questioning now.

12:25.710 --> 12:27.960
-Anything on the missing baby?
-Not yet.

12:27.960 --> 12:31.210
What's this guy thinking?
Murder, kidnapping a child.

12:31.210 --> 12:32.540
He had to know that law enforcement

12:32.540 --> 12:34.670
was gonna come down on him
like a ton of bricks.

12:34.670 --> 12:35.880
It's got to be personal.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.920
I'm just curious as to if Morpheus
intends to remain anonymous after this.

12:38.920 --> 12:40.210
He doesn't.

12:40.210 --> 12:43.750
It's got to be an endgame, and whatever
it is, consequences don't matter.

13:17.460 --> 13:18.960
What's up, Markus?

13:21.080 --> 13:23.670
I'm SSA Derek Morgan.
I just want to ask you a few questions.

13:23.670 --> 13:25.790
Didn't kill Pearson
and didn't take the baby.

13:26.420 --> 13:28.710
I got a gallery opening tonight.
Are we done?

13:29.040 --> 13:31.170
No. We're not done.

13:33.290 --> 13:34.420
Have a seat.

13:42.080 --> 13:43.750
I'll start with the obvious.

13:44.120 --> 13:45.750
Do you know Morpheus' identity?

13:45.750 --> 13:47.460
No. Nobody does.

13:47.710 --> 13:49.670
Why'd you take his artwork
down two weeks ago?

13:49.670 --> 13:52.580
A better question is,
why'd he put it up to begin with?

13:53.880 --> 13:55.500
Let me tell you about Morpheus.

13:56.290 --> 14:00.120
This dude comes swooping on in
anytime there's a photo op.

14:00.120 --> 14:02.250
Every issue is suddenly his issue.

14:04.120 --> 14:05.540
Not here.

14:05.540 --> 14:07.250
This is my city.

14:07.250 --> 14:09.330
Detroit's own can take care of Detroit.

14:12.040 --> 14:14.040
How'd you find him
before anybody else did?

14:15.170 --> 14:16.710
What do you mean?

14:16.710 --> 14:19.290
Morpheus assembled his artwork
in the middle of the night.

14:19.290 --> 14:22.380
Remote location.
How'd you stumble upon it first?

14:23.540 --> 14:25.250
He's gotten predictable, that's how.

14:25.250 --> 14:27.210
What he'll do, where he'll do it. Pfft.

14:27.500 --> 14:29.670
His routine's tired. It's played out.

14:29.670 --> 14:31.040
Really?

14:35.540 --> 14:39.250
I was kind of under the impression
that he was a really successful guy.

14:40.290 --> 14:41.620
More successful than you.

14:48.750 --> 14:50.880
Like the expression goes,

14:50.880 --> 14:52.250
time will tell.

14:53.710 --> 14:56.710
Did you ever think that somebody else
might just be setting him up?

14:56.710 --> 14:58.080
No. Why would I?

14:58.080 --> 15:00.790
Well, he seems like
a pretty easy target, right?

15:00.790 --> 15:02.040
With the secrecy and all.

15:02.040 --> 15:04.210
Uh... Are you saying
you don't think he did any of this?

15:04.210 --> 15:06.250
Markus, I'm just having a real hard time

15:06.250 --> 15:09.040
seeing the upside for him
to suddenly start kidnapping and killing.

15:09.040 --> 15:10.580
That's what I'm saying.

15:10.580 --> 15:14.380
Upside is people start paying attention
to him again.

15:15.380 --> 15:17.750
The man is desperate. Lost his edge.

15:20.120 --> 15:22.420
Morpheus ain't nothing
to anybody anymore.

15:22.420 --> 15:25.000
So you think this is all just
a publicity stunt.

15:27.040 --> 15:28.420
What I think...

15:29.960 --> 15:32.000
All this stuff now,

15:32.460 --> 15:35.290
that's Morpheus trying to stay relevant.

15:37.790 --> 15:39.500
And crazy as it sounds,

15:40.500 --> 15:41.830
it just might work.

16:07.460 --> 16:10.250
- -

16:32.960 --> 16:34.580
Garcia's slowly chipping away.

16:34.580 --> 16:36.380
She picked up a money trail
from Florida

16:36.380 --> 16:38.830
to some of Morpheus'
known locations in the past.

16:38.830 --> 16:41.120
No viable leads, no ransom demand.

16:41.120 --> 16:43.080
I mean, if it's not about money,
then what?

16:43.080 --> 16:44.920
Why else do children get abducted?

16:44.920 --> 16:48.580
Normally with an infant this young,
we'd consider maternal desire.

16:48.580 --> 16:50.670
But it doesn't really fit in this case.

16:50.670 --> 16:54.210
No. And then there's human trafficking,
but then why bother leaving art behind?

16:54.210 --> 16:56.330
That, and the Wallace baby's
too high-profile.

16:56.330 --> 16:59.170
Traffickers usually prefer
below-the-radar victims.

16:59.170 --> 17:01.120
Just got a call from
Markus Ivey's manager.

17:01.120 --> 17:03.000
He never showed for his
gallery opening tonight

17:03.000 --> 17:04.580
and she wanted to know
if he was still here.

17:04.580 --> 17:06.210
We cut him loose hours ago.

17:06.210 --> 17:09.960
I... I told her that. She gave me the
address of a private studio he keeps.

17:09.960 --> 17:12.250
-Sounded pretty worried.
-Let's check it out.

18:09.790 --> 18:11.000
Rossi.

18:22.080 --> 18:24.210
Thanks. The Wallaces
confirmed the stuffed animal

18:24.210 --> 18:26.380
is the one missing from
their daughter's nursery.

18:26.380 --> 18:27.880
This is a major shift in MO,

18:27.880 --> 18:30.040
behind closed doors
instead of out in the street,

18:30.040 --> 18:31.380
nothing overtly political.

18:31.380 --> 18:33.330
It almost feels like some sort of taunt.

18:33.330 --> 18:36.500
Elaborate staging this time, too.
The lullaby, the empty bassinet.

18:36.500 --> 18:37.920
No, there's no doubt this is personal.

18:37.920 --> 18:40.000
It's not about gentrification.
This is about the baby.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.080
Absent child.

18:41.080 --> 18:43.620
The abducted baby could be
a projection of the UnSub himself.

18:43.620 --> 18:46.040
Or not.

18:46.040 --> 18:49.620
He might have just been an
unwilling participant in a bigger endgame.

18:49.620 --> 18:53.120
Reid, do you have the photographs
of Morpheus' other work?

18:53.120 --> 18:54.380
Thanks.

18:59.210 --> 19:00.670
The signatures match.

19:00.670 --> 19:02.830
Wait a minute.
-What do you see?

19:02.830 --> 19:05.120
Morpheus is always extremely precise
with his signature.

19:05.120 --> 19:08.040
-It never varies.
-It looks the same to me.

19:08.460 --> 19:09.750
But it isn't.

19:10.920 --> 19:14.330
The bottom of the "U" never intersects
the "S" in the mobile signature.

19:14.330 --> 19:16.500
And look. The lower two
horizontal bars of the "E"

19:16.500 --> 19:18.670
fall just short of the left side
of the "U."

19:18.670 --> 19:21.420
And the alignment of
the "M" is marginally off.

19:21.880 --> 19:23.580
This is not Morpheus' signature.

19:23.580 --> 19:25.080
-A forgery?
-That's what I think.

19:25.080 --> 19:26.620
That means the signatures
in the nursery

19:26.620 --> 19:29.040
and the Russell Pearson crime scene
are probably also forgeries.

19:29.040 --> 19:31.290
Okay, well, then that brings us
back to our set-up theory.

19:31.290 --> 19:33.040
So who would have a motive
to frame Morpheus

19:33.040 --> 19:34.830
for both the kidnapping
and the murder?

19:34.830 --> 19:36.960
Someone with an ax to grind,
a grudge.

19:36.960 --> 19:39.170
Is there another rival artist
like Markus Ivey?

19:39.170 --> 19:40.580
You know, I keep
coming back to the fact

19:40.580 --> 19:43.380
that Ivey knew the location
of the Morpheus work beforehand.

19:43.380 --> 19:46.620
He told Morgan that it was because
Morpheus was becoming predictable,

19:46.620 --> 19:48.040
but I don't buy it.

19:48.040 --> 19:50.880
What if Markus Ivey was tipped by someone
who actually did know Morpheus?

19:50.880 --> 19:53.120
Like who?
HOTCH: I don't know, but think about it.

19:53.120 --> 19:55.880
For Morpheus to stay underground
year after year, he's gotta have help.

19:55.880 --> 19:57.170
- -

19:57.170 --> 19:58.540
Garcia.-Yes, sir?

19:58.540 --> 20:02.080
I need you to start a parallel search
for a possible associate of Morpheus.

20:02.080 --> 20:03.670
Okay, sure. I love parallel searches.

20:03.670 --> 20:06.380
You should know that the original
search is not going well,

20:06.380 --> 20:08.880
and I would really appreciate it if you
guys would put your noggins together

20:08.880 --> 20:11.750
and give me a nudge in how to proceed.

20:11.750 --> 20:14.620
Okay, well, this person would follow
the exact same geographical timeline

20:14.620 --> 20:16.210
that you built for Morpheus.

20:16.210 --> 20:18.750
We think the UnSub might have his
home base on the Gulf Coast of Florida.

20:18.750 --> 20:20.790
See if any money
from the various locations

20:20.790 --> 20:23.210
in your geo-profile
was wired to or from there.

20:23.500 --> 20:25.540
That's a beautiful nudge. Thank you.

20:25.540 --> 20:28.960
In Morpheus' first art piece in Detroit,
we found a distinctive blue chalk spray

20:28.960 --> 20:30.460
with a UV-resistant fixative.

20:30.460 --> 20:33.500
He used the same material
in New Orleans several years ago.

20:33.500 --> 20:34.960
I'd check to see if he ordered it
from the same outlet

20:34.960 --> 20:37.500
-or found a similar source nearby.-Uh-huh. Keep that coming.

20:37.500 --> 20:40.290
This possible associate
hasn't announced himself either.

20:40.290 --> 20:42.120
It means he may have reason to hide.

20:42.120 --> 20:45.000
Crosscheck any names you get
with those who have done prison time

20:45.000 --> 20:46.830
or have outstanding warrants.

20:46.830 --> 20:50.080
"Okay. I am on it,"
she said with confidence. Okay.

20:50.460 --> 20:53.170
Let's get back to the P.D.
We have a lot of work to do.

21:41.170 --> 21:44.710
There have been Corinne Wallace
sightings from Mexico to Nova Scotia.

21:44.710 --> 21:47.580
-People are well-meaning, but...
-How are the parents?

21:47.580 --> 21:48.960
Well, it's been tough.

21:48.960 --> 21:51.460
They've gone to a hotel
to try to get some sleep.

21:55.210 --> 21:57.620
-That's strange.
-What is?

21:57.620 --> 22:01.000
The Markus Ivey crime scene
and the bassinet next to the body.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
There's a small blue blanket.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.170
-What about it?
-I've seen it before. Here.

22:06.170 --> 22:09.210
What is it, Garcia?

22:09.210 --> 22:11.750
I found him, Morpheus'
associate or assistant or whatever.

22:11.750 --> 22:13.080
Corey Marlin.

22:13.080 --> 22:14.380
What makes you so sure?

22:14.380 --> 22:16.750
Well, you said Gulf Coast of Florida.
He's from Tampa.

22:16.750 --> 22:19.210
He was in prison for four years
for beating a guy half to death

22:19.210 --> 22:20.500
in a bar fight.

22:20.500 --> 22:23.000
He has a bunch of outstanding warrants
from forever ago.

22:23.000 --> 22:25.040
When he was in prison,
he took up painting.

22:25.040 --> 22:28.120
Said he wanted to become an artist.
Ooh, and the timeline matches, too.

22:28.120 --> 22:31.790
Marlin fell off the face of the Earth
in 2007 right when Morpheus showed up.

22:31.790 --> 22:34.000
If Morpheus has an associate,
this has gotta be our guy.

22:34.000 --> 22:37.210
Never mind associate.
Could Corey Marlin actually be Morpheus?

22:37.210 --> 22:38.750
Oh, well, that's doubtful.

22:38.750 --> 22:41.330
Uh, Marlin's work might have wowed 'em
in cell block C,

22:41.330 --> 22:43.620
but he doesn't have the artistic chops
that Morpheus does.

22:43.620 --> 22:47.170
He did, however, wire money
from an account in Sarasota

22:47.170 --> 22:50.500
to locations that match
the movements of Morpheus.

22:50.500 --> 22:53.540
Every week like clockwork,
up till three weeks ago.

22:53.540 --> 22:56.670
-Maybe the association ended.
-At the same time the killing began.

22:56.670 --> 22:58.000
I'm sending all this to you right now.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.170
Thanks, Garcia.

23:00.080 --> 23:01.790
An AMBER Alert has been activated

23:01.790 --> 23:04.040
in the search for missing
8-month-old Corinne Wallace

23:04.040 --> 23:05.710
who was abducted
from her family's home

23:05.710 --> 23:07.290
in Grosse Pointe yesterday morning.

23:07.290 --> 23:10.330
A primary suspect in the apparent
kidnapping has emerged.

23:10.330 --> 23:14.040
Corey Marlin of Sarasota, Florida.
The public should exercise caution,

23:14.040 --> 23:16.880
because police say Marlin has
a history of violent behavior

23:16.880 --> 23:19.000
and should be considered
armed and dangerous.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.580
A tip line has been set up
at Detroit Police headquarters,

23:21.580 --> 23:25.460
and anyone with information on the baby
or Corey Marlin is urged to call.

23:25.460 --> 23:27.080
It took me a little while to find them.

23:27.080 --> 23:29.170
This one's from
the Markus Ivey crime scene.

23:29.960 --> 23:32.670
And this one is from
the burnt-out car art piece

23:32.670 --> 23:34.920
Morpheus did a couple months ago.

23:37.920 --> 23:39.460
It's two halves
of the same blanket.

23:39.460 --> 23:40.750
It's weird, though.

23:40.750 --> 23:42.710
I mean,
we know Morpheus was responsible

23:42.710 --> 23:44.080
for the burnt-out car art piece.

23:44.080 --> 23:45.710
His signature was real
and he claimed credit for it

23:45.710 --> 23:47.380
on his encrypted social media site.

23:47.380 --> 23:49.830
But the Markus Ivey murder was done
by an imposter.

23:49.830 --> 23:53.000
Mmm. So how did two pieces of the
same blanket end up in both locations?

23:53.000 --> 23:55.960
Corey Marlin would have had access
to Morpheus' materials.

23:55.960 --> 23:59.040
Agent Hotchner.
There's a call about the missing baby.

23:59.040 --> 24:01.540
I think you should take this one.
It's on line three.

24:03.210 --> 24:04.380
Hello?

24:04.380 --> 24:06.170
Is this Agent Aaron Hotchner?

24:06.170 --> 24:07.540
Who is this?

24:07.540 --> 24:10.210
If you want to find the child,
go to 325 West Warren.

24:10.210 --> 24:12.670
-Who is this?-325 West Warren.

24:12.670 --> 24:14.960
-You have 30 minutes.-

24:18.540 --> 24:20.250
Lewis, let's go.

24:42.670 --> 24:44.120
It's a login code.

24:58.210 --> 24:59.460
Agent Hotchner.

24:59.460 --> 25:00.500
Who's this?

25:00.920 --> 25:02.620
This is Morpheus.

25:08.540 --> 25:10.290
Do you have Corinne Wallace?

25:10.290 --> 25:12.710
No. That's why I wanted
to speak with you.

25:12.960 --> 25:14.210
I want to help.

25:14.500 --> 25:16.830
How do we know
you're the real Morpheus?

25:16.830 --> 25:19.830
Right now, all you need to know
is that I would never hurt a child.

25:19.830 --> 25:23.330
This is Agent Lewis.
You're asking us to take a lot on faith.

25:23.330 --> 25:26.380
Why would I intentionally
expose myself to the FBI?

25:27.500 --> 25:29.500
I came to Detroit two months ago.

25:29.500 --> 25:31.830
I've only made three works
since I've been here.

25:31.830 --> 25:35.210
I don't know who killed those men
or who took the baby.

25:35.210 --> 25:38.040
Is there anyone else who could have
access to your art materials?

25:38.040 --> 25:39.500
Nobody.

25:39.500 --> 25:40.880
Not even Corey Marlin?

25:43.330 --> 25:44.710
Did he commit these crimes?

25:44.710 --> 25:47.420
You seem pretty certain.

25:47.420 --> 25:49.250
I know him. He was my partner.

25:49.250 --> 25:50.920
But the partnership's over.

25:50.920 --> 25:53.290
Yes. Why do you want
to know about my materials?

25:53.290 --> 25:56.790
You used a piece of blue blanket
in your first work in Detroit.

25:57.960 --> 26:01.040
-What is this about?-We have the other piece of that blanket.

26:02.460 --> 26:04.500
-It's not possible.-It's true.

26:05.620 --> 26:06.750
I've told you enough.

26:09.120 --> 26:10.750
We certainly hit a nerve.

26:11.920 --> 26:13.000
What are you thinking?

26:13.420 --> 26:16.420
What struck me was the concern
for the child above all else.

26:17.040 --> 26:19.750
And did you notice the cadence
in the speech pattern?

26:20.830 --> 26:22.170
I think Morpheus is a woman.

26:39.460 --> 26:41.620
Hey, talk to me.
Any progress, baby girl?

26:41.620 --> 26:43.670
Morpheus as a female helps,

26:43.670 --> 26:46.210
but there are over 50 women
in the Gulf Coast

26:46.210 --> 26:48.710
that went missing
during that time period.

26:48.710 --> 26:51.790
Did any of these missing women
have an art school background?

26:51.790 --> 26:53.920
Negative.

26:53.920 --> 26:55.000
Well, keep checking.

26:55.000 --> 26:58.380
Art galleries, museum employees,
related fields like graphic design.

26:58.380 --> 26:59.960
Okay. I'm all over this.

26:59.960 --> 27:01.540
- -

27:01.540 --> 27:04.000
You know, Corey Marlin
could still be our UnSub,

27:04.000 --> 27:05.420
despite what Morpheus says.

27:05.420 --> 27:07.210
There's another possibility here.

27:07.210 --> 27:10.170
Morpheus is the UnSub,
has always been the UnSub.

27:10.170 --> 27:11.460
Because?

27:11.460 --> 27:14.250
Morpheus' career has
been about manipulation.

27:14.250 --> 27:16.380
"You look that way, I'll go this way."

27:17.420 --> 27:18.920
Rossi, you really believe that?

27:20.210 --> 27:23.500
No. I still like Corey Marlin for it.

27:23.500 --> 27:26.460
When in doubt, go with the guy
with the long prison record.

27:58.540 --> 28:00.620
It's been over 30 hours since
Corinne Wallace was taken.

28:00.620 --> 28:02.000
We're running out of time.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.750
Corey Marlin turned up dead
in a downtown motel,

28:04.750 --> 28:07.080
bound and shot.
Body shows signs of torture.

28:07.080 --> 28:08.580
Any sign of the Wallace baby?

28:08.580 --> 28:11.420
No. And no evidence of the child
ever having been there.

28:11.420 --> 28:12.880
I'll have Agent Morgan meet you there.

28:12.880 --> 28:16.080
You know, this could be Morpheus.
She and Corey had a falling out,

28:16.080 --> 28:18.420
she knows that we're onto Corey,
Corey can reveal her secrets.

28:18.420 --> 28:19.880
The torture doesn't make sense.

28:19.880 --> 28:21.960
She didn't convey that level
of suppressed rage.

28:21.960 --> 28:23.790
Well, then, it has to be someone
looking for information.

28:23.790 --> 28:26.710
Corey seems to be the only person
that could tell Morpheus' whereabouts.

28:27.920 --> 28:31.040
Morpheus hung up on us
when I mentioned the blue blanket.

28:31.040 --> 28:33.670
-That stopped her cold.
-Wait a minute.

28:34.540 --> 28:35.830
Wait, look at this.

28:37.540 --> 28:41.620
This one is slightly more faded
and it's a little more worn out.

28:41.620 --> 28:44.830
It's subtle, but it would take years
for cloth to degrade like this.

28:44.830 --> 28:46.880
Whoever cut this blanket
did it a long time ago.

28:46.880 --> 28:49.420
They should be exactly the same,
but they're not.

28:49.670 --> 28:52.420
Morpheus came to Detroit
two months ago. Why then?

28:52.420 --> 28:54.210
The condo development controversy?

28:54.210 --> 28:56.540
I don't think so.
That's been an issue here for a while.

28:56.540 --> 28:57.960
Something else triggered her arrival.

28:57.960 --> 28:59.330
Well, then what happened two months ago?

29:00.080 --> 29:02.330
The mother and child died
in the overheated car.

29:03.710 --> 29:06.460
And that was Morpheus'
first piece of art in Detroit,

29:06.460 --> 29:09.250
the one that she used
her half of the blanket in.

29:09.670 --> 29:11.120
Garcia.-Yes, sir.

29:11.120 --> 29:13.500
Of all the women on your list,
did any lose a child?

29:13.500 --> 29:15.040
Uh, three did.

29:15.040 --> 29:19.080
And of those three, did any of those
children die between 2005 and 2008?

29:19.080 --> 29:20.790
Mmm-hmm. Ellen Clark.

29:20.790 --> 29:23.170
She lost her 3-year-old son
eight years ago.

29:23.170 --> 29:25.420
That coincides exactly
with the emergence of Morpheus.

29:25.420 --> 29:27.670
And what were the circumstances
of the child's death?

29:27.670 --> 29:32.500
Awful. It was a drowning accident
in a lake near Nokomis, Florida.

29:32.960 --> 29:35.790
Oh, sir! It has got to be Ellen Clark.

29:35.790 --> 29:38.000
Uh, she briefly audited courses

29:38.000 --> 29:41.040
at the Glenbury School
of Art and Design in Sarasota.

29:41.040 --> 29:42.790
And what about the father?

29:42.790 --> 29:45.540
William Cochran, who was a teacher
there when she was a student.

29:45.540 --> 29:47.920
That's how he and Ellen must have met.
He might have been her mentor.

29:47.920 --> 29:49.790
Uh, Cochran
was not at the school for very long.

29:49.790 --> 29:52.880
He was fired after an altercation
with another faculty member,

29:52.880 --> 29:54.960
and he underwent
a mandatory psych eval.

29:54.960 --> 29:57.380
So there were indicators
of mental instability from the start.

29:57.380 --> 29:58.710
What happened to him?

29:58.710 --> 30:00.830
After his son, Charlie, drowned,

30:00.830 --> 30:02.960
uh, William Cochran did
some drowning of his own in alcohol,

30:02.960 --> 30:05.080
and then he wound up
on the street for a while.

30:05.080 --> 30:06.460
And where is he now?

30:06.460 --> 30:08.380
He moved out of state a few years ago.

30:08.380 --> 30:11.120
Uh, looks like he's been
working as a handyman,

30:11.120 --> 30:14.790
trying to put his life back together,
in Waycross, Georgia, where he lives.

30:16.120 --> 30:17.460
-Uh-oh.
-What is it?

30:17.460 --> 30:19.000
William Cochran is on the move.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.880
He cleared out his bank account
nine days ago.

30:20.880 --> 30:22.420
He booked a one-way ticket to Detroit.

30:22.420 --> 30:25.750
I'm sending his photo and Ellen Clark's
to you right now.

30:25.750 --> 30:27.500
-Thanks.
-

30:43.580 --> 30:44.710
Hey.

30:45.000 --> 30:47.040
Shh. Quiet.

30:47.460 --> 30:49.000
Look, I brought you a present.

30:51.040 --> 30:53.670
Don't cry.
You're gonna make Mr. Turtle sad.

30:55.920 --> 30:57.710
It's almost over now.

31:13.460 --> 31:15.580
Well, we sent Ellen Clark
and William Cochran's photo

31:15.580 --> 31:18.250
to every hotel in the greater Detroit area
and nothing yet.

31:18.250 --> 31:21.250
Ellen and William lose their son
and then things go downhill for William.

31:21.250 --> 31:23.080
So did he grab the Wallace baby

31:23.080 --> 31:25.170
so they could start all over again
with a brand-new child?

31:25.170 --> 31:27.250
I'm going a different direction.

31:27.960 --> 31:31.000
The drowning of the child
ended the relationship.

31:31.000 --> 31:34.580
William and Ellen each took half of the
boy's blanket as a memento, a keepsake.

31:34.580 --> 31:37.670
But when William saw it show up
in Ellen's art piece, he flipped out.

31:37.670 --> 31:40.580
To him that was crossing the line.
And then he headed straight to Detroit.

31:40.580 --> 31:41.710
To take revenge on her.

31:41.710 --> 31:45.670
But before killing Ellen, he had to
destroy the legacy of Morpheus,

31:45.670 --> 31:48.500
-taint it with murder.
-Yeah, but then why take the baby?

31:49.120 --> 31:50.580
I don't know.

31:50.580 --> 31:53.000
To remind her of the loss
of their own child, maybe.

31:53.000 --> 31:56.080
And then he tracks down Corey Marlin and
tortures him to find out where Ellen is.

31:56.080 --> 31:58.380
And hopefully Corey didn't talk,
because if he did,

31:58.960 --> 32:01.170
Ellen could be in some serious trouble.

32:08.580 --> 32:09.790
- -

32:09.790 --> 32:12.960
It's been a long time, Ellen.
It's been a long time.

32:19.040 --> 32:21.880
William Cochran's not registered
at any hotel or motel,

32:21.880 --> 32:23.120
at least not under his own name.

32:23.120 --> 32:24.460
He could have some sort
of short-term rental.

32:24.460 --> 32:27.790
Or moved into some abandoned space.
There's plenty of those.

32:27.790 --> 32:30.670
But he does have a child with him.
He's gotta be careful.

32:30.670 --> 32:34.750
He'd also need a space big enough
to build his art pieces.

32:34.750 --> 32:36.670
If he came here searching for Ellen,

32:36.670 --> 32:40.710
he probably set up shop in one of the two
artsy areas of town, but which one?

32:40.710 --> 32:43.830
If he left his car in Georgia,
he'd need access to public transportation.

32:43.830 --> 32:46.670
Within walking distance of stores
for his daily needs.

32:46.670 --> 32:49.000
And the baby's.
He was very gentle with the baby

32:49.000 --> 32:51.290
when he took her, and if she at all
represents the child he lost,

32:51.290 --> 32:53.880
-he'll continue to take care of her.
-Proper baby food, diapers,

32:53.880 --> 32:56.000
maybe a temporary playpen of some sort.

32:56.000 --> 32:58.500
In the two arts districts,
this one's mostly just warehouses,

32:58.500 --> 33:01.210
but this one's definitely
got a store or two.

33:01.210 --> 33:03.750
I'll have photos of Cochran distributed
to all the local shopkeepers.

33:03.750 --> 33:04.880
Great.

33:08.790 --> 33:10.540
The baby, is she okay?

33:10.540 --> 33:13.460
The baby's fine.
-You need to give her back.

33:13.460 --> 33:16.830
Well, it's a shame that you didn't care
as much about our own child.

33:16.830 --> 33:18.330
Maybe Charlie'd still be alive.

33:20.210 --> 33:22.170
What happened to Charlie
was an accident.

33:22.420 --> 33:26.920
He was lying at the bottom of a lake,
while you were busy painting.

33:27.880 --> 33:29.790
It all happened so fast.

33:32.830 --> 33:34.670
I was sketching.

33:37.580 --> 33:39.080
I looked up and he was gone.

33:41.120 --> 33:42.540
Why did you do it?

33:45.000 --> 33:46.880
Charlie's blanket.

33:48.960 --> 33:51.080
You stuck it in that piece of art,

33:51.080 --> 33:54.420
like it was some junk
you buy in a thrift store.

33:54.420 --> 33:58.120
I did it to honor the homeless child
that died in that car.

34:00.040 --> 34:01.580
And to honor Charlie.

34:02.540 --> 34:03.960
That's a strange choice.

34:04.380 --> 34:06.750
But life is just a series of choices,
isn't it?

34:07.330 --> 34:09.290
Stare at a sketch pad

34:09.710 --> 34:12.830
rather than watch a child
at the water's edge.

34:17.170 --> 34:18.670
You sit down!

34:19.380 --> 34:21.790
Let me tell you
what's gonna happen today.

34:22.380 --> 34:25.000
I'm gonna give you
one last choice to make.

34:26.040 --> 34:29.080
Either you're gonna die
or the baby's gonna die.

34:32.460 --> 34:33.960
Which one?

34:34.920 --> 34:36.420
It's your decision.

34:37.120 --> 34:39.670
-Don't do this.
-Who am I gonna kill, Ellen?

34:40.540 --> 34:41.670
Tell me.

34:45.080 --> 34:47.120
A store owner recognized Cochran
from his photo.

34:47.120 --> 34:48.880
He's been in twice to buy baby food.

34:48.880 --> 34:51.170
She saw him go into
a building across the street.

34:51.830 --> 34:54.330
Time's up. Who's it gonna be?

34:59.380 --> 35:01.670
-No.
-Which one?

35:02.040 --> 35:03.750
I'm not going to do that.

35:03.750 --> 35:05.670
-Which one?
-No!

35:05.670 --> 35:07.920
I'll kill both of you, starting with her.

35:07.920 --> 35:10.790
No, wait!
Wait, just kill me!

35:12.330 --> 35:14.080
Kill me.

35:16.170 --> 35:17.580
Okay.

35:17.580 --> 35:18.670
Let's go.

35:29.790 --> 35:31.000
Cover the back.

35:33.620 --> 35:36.330
-This way. Come on. Go.
-

35:40.290 --> 35:41.830
William, please listen to me.

35:41.830 --> 35:43.790
-Shut up.
-No.

35:44.620 --> 35:46.080
I know what you're feeling.

35:46.080 --> 35:47.920
-No, you don't.
-Yes, I do.

35:47.920 --> 35:50.330
I couldn't handle what happened either.

35:50.330 --> 35:52.120
So I became somebody else.

35:56.420 --> 35:58.880
Somebody who didn't let
her little boy drown.

36:01.750 --> 36:03.040
I miss him.

36:03.880 --> 36:06.420
So do I.

36:16.920 --> 36:18.250
We can't bring Charlie back.

36:21.080 --> 36:23.500
Lewis, I'm going up.
-

36:25.080 --> 36:29.460
But at least you can die knowing
that you saved another child's life.

36:30.080 --> 36:31.620
I didn't make a choice.

36:31.620 --> 36:33.580
-Of course you did.
-No.

36:34.500 --> 36:36.540
You were never gonna
kill that little girl.

36:38.750 --> 36:40.290
I know you.

36:43.460 --> 36:46.170
- I loved you.
-William Cochran, drop the gun.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.620
Let Ellen go and drop the weapon.

36:55.960 --> 36:57.710
-I'm sorry.
-

37:56.460 --> 37:58.620
How's the diet going?

37:59.710 --> 38:04.120
I just wondered if you were, uh,
trying to regain those 185 pounds.

38:06.080 --> 38:08.620
No, I think I'm...
Think I'm gonna keep them off.

38:11.460 --> 38:13.120
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

38:13.120 --> 38:16.460
But if it's any consolation to you,
I've been there more than once,

38:17.420 --> 38:19.250
and I'm still standing.

38:20.250 --> 38:22.710
Rossi...

38:22.710 --> 38:26.420
Do you think our basic
personalities can ever change?

38:28.040 --> 38:29.330
No.

38:30.830 --> 38:32.670
Maybe a degree here or there,

38:32.670 --> 38:36.420
but I think we come
out of the oven fully cooked.

38:37.670 --> 38:38.880
Hmm.

38:39.960 --> 38:42.210
-It worries me sometimes.
-Why?

38:42.790 --> 38:46.080
I tend to be all in, you know?

38:47.170 --> 38:50.920
-Damn the consequences.
-That's why you're good at your job.

38:52.750 --> 38:53.880
Embrace it.

39:04.170 --> 39:07.920
I thought we weren't supposed
to meet again until next Friday.

39:07.920 --> 39:09.620
I moved it up.

39:09.620 --> 39:12.080
Know what I figured out the other day?

39:13.500 --> 39:14.960
What's that?

39:16.830 --> 39:20.540
You think you're interviewing me.

39:21.000 --> 39:24.670
But I'm really the one interviewing you.

39:24.670 --> 39:27.250
You may be onto something, Leonard.

39:29.250 --> 39:30.500
How's Douglas?

39:33.620 --> 39:34.750
He left.

39:37.080 --> 39:38.250
Because of me?

39:39.830 --> 39:41.210
You were part of it, yeah.

39:41.880 --> 39:44.880
Was it one of those deals

39:44.880 --> 39:47.330
where he says you have to choose
one or the other?

39:47.920 --> 39:49.960
Something like that, yeah.

39:51.670 --> 39:53.420
And you chose me.

39:57.620 --> 39:59.330
No, Leonard.

40:00.750 --> 40:02.540
I chose me.

40:06.250 --> 40:07.250
Let's get started.

40:08.420 --> 40:09.750
You were talking about...

40:09.750 --> 40:11.580
A Spanish proverb says,

40:11.580 --> 40:15.380
"More grows in the garden
than the gardener knows he has planted."
