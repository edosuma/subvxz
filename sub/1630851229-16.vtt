WEBVTT

00:01.393 --> 00:03.560
<i> -Previously on</i> The Resident...
-I think we should

00:03.562 --> 00:06.897
dig into Dr. Bosley's
patient outcomes and...

00:06.899 --> 00:09.082
give Ms. Benesch a fair hearing.

00:09.084 --> 00:10.825
Let's just simmer down.

00:10.827 --> 00:12.368
Just watch

00:12.370 --> 00:13.920
and learn how we operate.

00:13.922 --> 00:16.015
I-I think I'm getting a pretty
good sense of how you operate.

00:16.017 --> 00:18.258
Are you looking
for a financial settlement?

00:18.260 --> 00:20.185
No. I'm looking
for accountability.

00:20.187 --> 00:22.670
I did not have to end up
like this.

00:22.672 --> 00:25.432
I don't want future patients
of Dr. Bosley to, either.

00:25.434 --> 00:27.584
I want the board
to do something.

00:27.586 --> 00:30.195
-Will they?
-Honestly, probably not.

00:30.197 --> 00:33.240
But I will do something.

00:34.035 --> 00:36.410
<i> (grunting)</i>

00:44.286 --> 00:45.769
So what's happening
in the world?

00:45.771 --> 00:47.437
-I'm not reading the news.
<i> -(grunting)</i>

00:47.439 --> 00:49.214
I'm watching a video
of a bulldog

00:49.216 --> 00:51.458
failing to eat its kibble.

00:51.460 --> 00:52.943
Okay.

00:52.945 --> 00:54.386
Slow news day.

00:55.222 --> 00:56.613
What's going on with your leg?

00:56.615 --> 00:58.724
Oh, I guess it slept in.

00:58.726 --> 00:59.892
(groans)

00:59.894 --> 01:01.543
Could be an MS flare-up.

01:01.545 --> 01:03.729
I'll email Dr. Greer,
see if she can fit you in today.

01:03.731 --> 01:05.380
Yeah, well, early is better.

01:05.382 --> 01:07.124
I have a 10:00 with Abernathy,

01:07.126 --> 01:08.383
the head of the medical board,

01:08.385 --> 01:10.310
'cause I found more complaints
against Bosley,

01:10.312 --> 01:12.796
the neurosurgeon
who paralyzed Emily Benesch.

01:12.798 --> 01:15.299
Do you think you have enough
to convince the board

01:15.301 --> 01:17.859
to look into Bosley now?

01:17.861 --> 01:20.153
I'm not gonna give 'em
any choice.

01:20.155 --> 01:24.825
You know,
this whole moral crusader thing

01:24.827 --> 01:26.476
looks good on you.

01:26.478 --> 01:27.477
It's very...

01:27.479 --> 01:28.995
super hero-y.

01:28.997 --> 01:30.480
You should see me in spandex.

01:30.482 --> 01:32.508
-Well, that's ruined it.
(chuckles)
-(chuckles)

01:34.578 --> 01:35.928
(indistinct chatter)

01:35.930 --> 01:37.321
Can I help you?

01:37.323 --> 01:38.764
You look familiar,
but I can't place you.

01:38.766 --> 01:40.991
Are you gonna harass me
every time I have an ER shift?

01:40.993 --> 01:43.844
-Yes.
-You know, please look
into your abandonment issues.

01:43.846 --> 01:46.012
You know my father left me
at Yankee Stadium and got home

01:46.014 --> 01:48.348
with my brother before
he realized I was missing.

01:48.350 --> 01:50.792
I'm sorry I triggered you,
Irving.

01:50.794 --> 01:52.093
You don't care. Where's Leela?

01:52.095 --> 01:53.779
Sister day with Padma.

01:53.781 --> 01:55.355
Bonding over the gifting
of eggs.

01:55.357 --> 01:56.949
Level-1 trauma coming in!

01:56.951 --> 01:59.042
Bay 11's ready.

01:59.845 --> 02:01.453
Eliza Brockton.
32-year-old female.

02:01.455 --> 02:03.530
Status post-fall from her
sixth-floor apartment building.

02:03.532 --> 02:06.016
BP 120/68, tachy to 100,

02:06.018 --> 02:07.292
satting at 98%.

02:08.445 --> 02:10.295
Trauma survey.

02:11.281 --> 02:13.966
Pupils equal and reactive.

02:13.968 --> 02:15.450
DEVON:
Airway's intact.

02:15.452 --> 02:18.211
-Good breath sounds bilaterally.
-HUNDLEY: Pulse strong.

02:18.213 --> 02:20.547
Vitals stable. I'll get labs.

02:20.549 --> 02:23.367
I'll do a FAST exam
and put in for a chest X-ray.

02:23.369 --> 02:24.626
Eliza,

02:24.628 --> 02:27.387
how did you fall
from your apartment building?

02:27.389 --> 02:28.555
I-I was, um...

02:28.557 --> 02:30.816
I was hanging
a-an orchid on my balcony,

02:30.818 --> 02:34.987
and I-I reached too far over the
railing and I just... (sighs)

02:34.989 --> 02:36.488
lost my balance.

02:36.490 --> 02:39.491
Thank God the entry awning
broke my fall.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.551
Well, we're gonna get
that chest X-ray

02:41.553 --> 02:44.145
and CT scan
to check for head trauma.

02:44.147 --> 02:45.389
We'll be back, okay?

02:45.391 --> 02:48.125
-Uh, okay.
-All right, hang tight.

02:50.896 --> 02:53.730
You want to get her records
and I'll arrange the CT?

02:53.732 --> 02:54.965
Yeah.

02:57.736 --> 02:59.595

03:01.164 --> 03:02.330

03:02.332 --> 03:04.165
Eliza's attempted suicide
three times

03:04.167 --> 03:05.726
in the past six years.

03:07.262 --> 03:09.763

Eliza's stable.

04:32.255 --> 04:34.164
Scans were negative.
BP was borderline,

04:34.166 --> 04:35.107
so we placed an A-line.

04:35.109 --> 04:36.608
And Psych is en route.

04:36.610 --> 04:39.927
That was a very brave thing

This is Dr. Malco.

05:14.297 --> 05:16.982
She's from
the psychiatry department.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.817
Hi, Eliza.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.544
I'm guessing
you know the drill here.

05:20.546 --> 05:22.029
I'm gonna ask you
a few questions.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.397
You have my file.

05:24.399 --> 05:26.399
So you could just read
my old answers.

05:26.401 --> 05:29.745
My new answers are all the same.

05:30.814 --> 05:32.164
I'm out of words.

05:33.149 --> 05:36.242
I imagine that must be
very difficult for a writer.

05:36.244 --> 05:37.627
To be out of words.

05:38.730 --> 05:41.064
I'm out of everything.

05:41.066 --> 05:42.899
I want you to know,

05:42.901 --> 05:46.678
both of your books have informed
the way I treat depression.

05:46.680 --> 05:49.014
I'd like to return the favor.

05:49.666 --> 05:51.058
Do you have a gun?

05:53.095 --> 05:56.063
We're gonna keep you
on a 36-hour hold.

06:04.031 --> 06:05.530
Dear merciful Father,

06:05.532 --> 06:08.592
we ask for Your blessings
on Daisy.

06:08.594 --> 06:09.868
She needs You.

06:09.870 --> 06:14.764
We're asking that You grant her
the patience to...

06:14.766 --> 06:17.191
help her with her affliction

06:17.193 --> 06:19.527
and the freedom from her pain.

06:19.529 --> 06:23.289
And lead her out
the shadow of the valley

06:23.291 --> 06:27.052
so that we can heal her body
and spirit.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.795
(chuckles softly)

06:29.781 --> 06:32.057
Now let's go get you
a damn kidney, huh? (chuckles)

06:32.059 --> 06:33.800
(chuckling)

06:33.802 --> 06:36.144
-Amen.
-Amen.

06:41.460 --> 06:44.294
-Ah... (grunts)
-(laughs)

06:44.296 --> 06:46.963
Aaron, it is good to see you.

06:46.965 --> 06:48.465
Yeah, it's been a minute.

06:48.467 --> 06:51.317
You know we've had our
own conversations about pain.

06:51.319 --> 06:52.302
Mm.

06:52.304 --> 06:54.304
How are you and Gigi holding up?

06:54.306 --> 06:56.063
Yeah, really well.

06:56.065 --> 06:58.250
Gigi's definitely
my greatest achievement so far.

06:58.252 --> 07:00.252
You got that right.

07:00.254 --> 07:01.311
Yeah.

07:01.313 --> 07:03.588
Speaking
of our past conversations,

07:03.590 --> 07:05.982
the last few days, I've...

07:05.984 --> 07:07.333
been...
(exhales)

07:07.335 --> 07:09.928
back in the fresh grief
of Nic's passing,

07:09.930 --> 07:12.413
I-I guess. I don't...

07:12.415 --> 07:14.916
Uh, I don't know
what set it off.

07:14.918 --> 07:17.936
Ah, well, if it isn't Pastor
Aaron, my favorite clergyman.

07:17.938 --> 07:20.922
AJ, my big bad Buddhist, you.

07:20.924 --> 07:22.590
-Hey.
-How are you?

07:22.592 --> 07:23.758
How's your mother?

07:23.760 --> 07:27.170
She is as well as she can be.

07:27.172 --> 07:29.172
The cancer is progressing.

07:29.174 --> 07:31.432
I'm sorry to hear that.

07:31.434 --> 07:33.452
I-I'll definitely have
to go see her.

07:33.454 --> 07:36.362
Well, you see, her palliative
care is top-tier, right?

07:36.364 --> 07:39.291
But she's gonna need
to transition

07:39.293 --> 07:41.201
to hospice sooner
rather than later,

07:41.203 --> 07:43.353
and she is not keen on the idea.

07:43.355 --> 07:45.297
So I was thinking
maybe you can help me

07:45.299 --> 07:47.874
have that conversation with her
when it's time.

07:47.876 --> 07:48.967
I'll be happy to.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.210
Appreciate it, man.

07:50.212 --> 07:54.455
I have a favor of my own
to ask you two.

07:54.457 --> 07:56.700
Yeah. Anything.

07:56.702 --> 08:00.645
Recently, I had a heart stent
placed a few months back.

08:00.647 --> 08:03.540
A fit young dude like you?

08:03.542 --> 08:05.317
They found some blockage.
Now, the doctor told me

08:05.319 --> 08:06.651
that I should be feeling better,

08:06.653 --> 08:09.229
but I've been having
a lot of chest pain lately.

08:09.231 --> 08:12.991
Ah, say no more. AJ and I will
take a look at you in the ER.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.493
Better safe than sorry.

08:14.495 --> 08:16.077
AUSTIN:
Let's go now.

08:17.981 --> 08:19.480
Head scans are good.

08:19.482 --> 08:21.057
-Nothing to worry about.
-Great.

08:21.059 --> 08:22.742
But the leg issue is
a little MS flare-up.

08:22.744 --> 08:24.819
No biggie. This will happen
from time to time.

08:24.821 --> 08:26.505
Well, I'm glad we checked, then.

08:26.507 --> 08:28.155
We'll put you on a short course
of steroids

08:28.157 --> 08:29.323
that should improve
your symptoms.

08:29.325 --> 08:30.900
In the meantime,
take the pressure

08:30.902 --> 08:32.736
-off your leg with this.
-BELL: Oh.

08:32.738 --> 08:35.830
(chuckles) No. That is...
uh, won't be necessary.

08:35.832 --> 08:37.665
GREER:
It's only for a few days.

08:37.667 --> 08:40.076
The last thing we want
is for you to stumble

08:40.078 --> 08:41.578
-and hit your head.
-Randolph,

08:41.580 --> 08:43.429
-take the cane.
-BELL: No, it's...

08:43.431 --> 08:45.673
(stammers) It starts
with a cane, and then it goes

08:45.675 --> 08:47.433
to adult diapers and a chairlift
to get up the stairs.

08:47.435 --> 08:50.177
It's a concession to the
disease, and I won't make it.

08:50.179 --> 08:52.030
Good Lord, Randolph.
Typical man.

08:52.032 --> 08:54.424
You can dress it as bravery,
but it's just vanity.

08:54.426 --> 08:57.427
Okay. Uh,
I'd love to stick around

08:57.429 --> 08:59.095
and talk about canes and men,

08:59.097 --> 09:01.598
but... I have
an important meeting to get to.

09:01.600 --> 09:02.999
So, Meghan, thank you.

09:07.363 --> 09:09.005
(sighs)

09:10.275 --> 09:11.716
I remember

09:11.718 --> 09:15.795
being at a birthday party when
I was four or five years old.

09:15.797 --> 09:17.705
And...

09:17.707 --> 09:20.708
the birthday girl
shrieked with joy

09:20.710 --> 09:24.971
when she unwrapped a doll
from her parents.

09:24.973 --> 09:27.473
For the first time,
I became distinctly aware

09:27.475 --> 09:32.478
that it was something
that I had never... felt.

09:33.315 --> 09:34.631
Is there anything
in your daily life

09:34.633 --> 09:37.284
that brings relief
from the pain and dread?

09:38.895 --> 09:41.413
Periodically, when I'm writing.

09:41.415 --> 09:44.398
Are there any moments
in your past where you...

09:44.400 --> 09:46.710
can recall feeling happy?

09:48.755 --> 09:50.371
This morning.

09:51.166 --> 09:52.924
When I felt the wind on my face

09:52.926 --> 09:57.012
as I fell to what
should have been my death.

09:59.324 --> 10:03.417
My reservoir of hope...

10:03.419 --> 10:05.478
is empty.

10:10.927 --> 10:13.153
(exhales)

10:19.786 --> 10:23.437
Eliza has what we call
treatment-resistant depression.

10:23.439 --> 10:26.124
Cognitive behavioral therapy,
antidepressants,

10:26.126 --> 10:28.460
and ECT have all
been ineffective.

10:28.462 --> 10:30.277
So, what do we do?

10:30.279 --> 10:32.021
We just keep her here

10:32.023 --> 10:33.781
for 34 hours and then just

10:33.783 --> 10:36.359
-let her walk out?
-We don't have a lot of options.

10:36.361 --> 10:39.137
Sad to say, I have no beds free
on the unit.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.306
Don't patients with

10:41.308 --> 10:43.383
treatment-resistant depression

10:43.385 --> 10:45.960
qualify for off-label
deep brain stimulation?

10:45.962 --> 10:47.461
I've read

10:47.463 --> 10:49.296
some clinical trials on it,

10:49.298 --> 10:51.316
and I know Dr. Sutton
has used it on patients

10:51.318 --> 10:53.652
with Parkinson's and even OCD.

10:53.654 --> 10:55.211
They do,

10:55.213 --> 10:57.155
but there's no guarantee
it works.

10:58.566 --> 11:00.233
Well, in one trial,

11:00.235 --> 11:03.578
50% of patients saw some relief
from their symptoms.

11:06.333 --> 11:10.418
Do you think Eliza
would consider the procedure?

11:12.005 --> 11:15.064
All Eliza wants is to exit life.

11:15.066 --> 11:17.175
It'll be challenging

11:17.177 --> 11:19.569
to get her to agree
to any treatment,

11:19.571 --> 11:21.495
much less one that requires
holes drilled in her skull

11:21.497 --> 11:23.998
and electrodes placed
in her brain.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.426
Well, if we do nothing, there
is no doubt that she will try

11:26.428 --> 11:29.245
-to kill herself again.
-No doubt.

11:29.247 --> 11:30.504
I'll talk to Dr. Sutton.

11:30.506 --> 11:33.191
See if she can discuss
the procedure with Eliza.

11:42.018 --> 11:43.535
Dr. Sullivan didn't come in?

11:43.537 --> 11:44.761
She took the day off.

11:44.763 --> 11:45.945
We got Pravesh back instead.

11:45.947 --> 11:47.931
Who?

11:47.933 --> 11:49.432
(chuckles)

11:49.434 --> 11:52.285
Good thing we looked into
your chest pain. You have EKG

11:52.287 --> 11:55.547
changes and labs consistent
with an NSTEMI.

11:55.549 --> 11:57.364
It's a minor heart attack.

11:57.366 --> 11:59.533
AARON:
What? A minor heart attack?

11:59.535 --> 12:01.611
-How is that possible?
-AUSTIN: Take it easy, Aaron.

12:01.613 --> 12:03.871
All right, we're on it.
We got you.

12:03.873 --> 12:05.465
Taking good care
of yourself, right?

12:05.467 --> 12:07.467
-Yes.
-AUSTIN: All right, well,

12:07.469 --> 12:09.561
explain to us how you ended up
with a cardiac stent.

12:09.563 --> 12:13.398
Well, this cardiac clinic came
to the church leaving flyers.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.400
They were offering
heart screenings

12:15.402 --> 12:17.460
with no out-of-pocket
with Medicaid.

12:17.462 --> 12:21.055
And, uh, now, my congregation

12:21.057 --> 12:22.389
relies on outreach, so

12:22.391 --> 12:24.484
I wanted to set an example
to the flock, so I went.

12:24.486 --> 12:27.394
And what did the screening
turn up?

12:27.396 --> 12:30.323
Cardiologist said that my...

12:30.325 --> 12:32.658
my labs and my tests were...

12:32.660 --> 12:33.918
"borderline" was the word,

12:33.920 --> 12:36.629
and that I needed a cath ASAP.

12:39.150 --> 12:41.334
Were you feeling any chest pain?

12:41.336 --> 12:43.410
No. No.

12:43.412 --> 12:45.597
He said that the cath
was very important

12:45.599 --> 12:48.415
to screen for heart disease.
Silent killer.

12:48.417 --> 12:52.687
Okay, but why did
they stent you?

12:55.091 --> 12:57.424
Well, during the procedure,

12:57.426 --> 13:00.186
my heart was beating
out of my chest.

13:00.188 --> 13:02.096
And the pain,

13:02.098 --> 13:04.340
I mean, it's very severe, but

13:04.342 --> 13:07.193
once they put in the stent,
I had relief.

13:07.195 --> 13:09.120
You know, I'm a little
achy and tired

13:09.122 --> 13:10.363
here and there,
but for the most part,

13:10.365 --> 13:12.940
-I'm-I'm thankful.
-(phone ringing)

13:13.868 --> 13:16.702
Chest pain usually comes
before cardiac

13:16.704 --> 13:18.797
catheterization, not after.

13:18.799 --> 13:20.189
Excuse me, I need to take this.

13:20.191 --> 13:22.467
I hate to do this
to you, brother,

13:22.469 --> 13:25.970
but we need to get you
in our cath lab right away.

13:25.972 --> 13:29.715
And I promise you, you won't
feel any pain with these hands.

13:29.717 --> 13:31.518
All right?

13:33.462 --> 13:35.462
We got you, man.

13:35.464 --> 13:37.798
Hey, Billie.

13:37.800 --> 13:39.542
-You got a sec?
-What's up?

13:39.544 --> 13:41.394
So, I have a young woman
in the ER,

13:41.396 --> 13:42.879
she's banged up pretty bad

13:42.881 --> 13:44.564
from two failed
suicide attempts today.

13:44.566 --> 13:47.733
Yeah, I heard Superman
flew in and saved her.

13:47.735 --> 13:51.329
Her name is Eliza Brockton.
She's very smart, wily.

13:51.331 --> 13:54.057
She's a memoirist
who wrote two best sellers

13:54.059 --> 13:55.224
about depression.

13:55.226 --> 13:56.984
Sure, yeah, I read
the first one,

13:56.986 --> 13:58.394
<i> The Lure of the Void.</i>

13:58.396 --> 14:00.246
Right.

14:00.248 --> 14:02.732
So, I think she's
a good candidate for DBS.

14:02.734 --> 14:06.511
Well, DBS is still experimental
for depression.

14:06.513 --> 14:07.920
Does she meet
the inclusion criteria?

14:07.922 --> 14:09.163
Yes.

14:09.165 --> 14:12.091
No improvement
from CBT, SSRIs, or ECT.

14:12.093 --> 14:13.259
-(phone buzzes)
-Okay.

14:13.261 --> 14:14.501
-I'll talk to her.
-Thanks.

14:15.597 --> 14:17.747
It's Trevor. I've been trying
to reach him for weeks.

14:17.749 --> 14:22.026
Take it. No, take it, and
let him know that we miss him.

14:23.605 --> 14:26.105
Trevor, I'm so glad
you finally called.

14:26.107 --> 14:28.591
<i> -Are you okay?</i>
-Uh, yeah, yeah.

14:28.593 --> 14:30.426
I'm sorry it took so long
to get back to you. Just...

14:30.428 --> 14:33.538
-dealing with a lot of stuff.
<i> -Of course.</i>

14:33.540 --> 14:35.264
I can only imagine
a horrible revelation like...

14:35.266 --> 14:36.708
<i> Yeah. We don't have to, um...</i>

14:38.194 --> 14:40.211
Look, there's some...
there's some stuff

14:40.213 --> 14:42.380
I want to tell you in person.

14:42.382 --> 14:45.441
Okay. Sure.

14:45.443 --> 14:47.886
Just know, I've been
worried about you.

14:47.888 --> 14:49.295
All of us here have.

14:49.297 --> 14:50.722
<i> And I'm not sure</i>
<i> if you're aware of this,</i>

14:50.724 --> 14:53.616
<i> but you're in danger</i>
<i> of losing your residency.</i>

14:53.618 --> 14:56.043
Yeah, I know.

14:56.045 --> 14:59.063
Uh, look, can we meet up
tomorrow? I'll fill you in.

15:00.066 --> 15:01.715
Yeah, sure. That works.

15:01.717 --> 15:03.651
<i> Cool. Thanks, Billie.</i>

15:05.630 --> 15:06.738
(phone beeps)

15:09.317 --> 15:11.134
Phones in your locker
while you're at the warehouse.

15:11.136 --> 15:12.151
Yeah, yeah, sorry. My bad.

15:12.153 --> 15:13.578
-You know that.
-Yeah.

15:18.251 --> 15:20.643
What's with the limp?
You okay, Randolph?

15:20.645 --> 15:23.454
Oh, I'm-I'm doing great.
Thanks for your concern.

15:23.456 --> 15:25.831
I want to talk to you
about Bosley.

15:25.833 --> 15:27.483
I don't get it.

15:27.485 --> 15:29.485
What is your beef
with Dr. Bosley?

15:29.487 --> 15:32.505
-Is this personal?
-I've never met the man.

15:32.507 --> 15:35.658
I told you last week,
Dr. Elkins was looking

15:35.660 --> 15:37.160
-into the Emily Benesch case.
-Well, you know...

15:37.162 --> 15:38.937
She didn't.

15:40.089 --> 15:42.256
These are five more complaints
against Bosley

15:42.258 --> 15:44.350
for catastrophic outcomes
that the board

15:44.352 --> 15:46.427
didn't look into either.

15:46.429 --> 15:47.928
(sighs)

15:47.930 --> 15:49.763
Look...

15:49.765 --> 15:51.524
I-I'm just not familiar with

15:51.526 --> 15:53.451
the details
of these old complaints

15:53.453 --> 15:54.768
off the top of my head,

15:54.770 --> 15:57.029
but I can tell you that,
if we made the decision

15:57.031 --> 15:58.864
not to investigate,

15:58.866 --> 16:00.792
we had good reasons.

16:00.794 --> 16:03.686
See, I can't imagine what those

16:03.688 --> 16:05.463
could possibly be.

16:05.465 --> 16:08.858
Randolph, you're a good man,
and I like you.

16:08.860 --> 16:12.286
You can be a very valuable
member of the medical board.

16:12.288 --> 16:14.455
That's what I'm trying to be.

16:14.457 --> 16:15.531
Well, typically,

16:15.533 --> 16:18.125
new members tend to stay
on the sidelines

16:18.127 --> 16:19.702
for a period
to see how things work

16:19.704 --> 16:22.296
before going full Norma Rae,

16:22.298 --> 16:24.540
you know what I mean?

16:24.542 --> 16:27.986
I'll see you at the
board meeting this afternoon.

16:30.490 --> 16:33.216
All right, Aaron,
I found the stent,

16:33.218 --> 16:35.718
and I also found the cause

16:35.720 --> 16:37.553
of your heart attack.

16:37.555 --> 16:40.573
Unfortunately,
they're one and the same.

16:40.575 --> 16:42.500
Uh, what does that mean?

16:42.502 --> 16:45.319
The stent your doctors placed
is actually blocking

16:45.321 --> 16:47.396
one of the other arteries
in your heart.

16:47.398 --> 16:50.066
That's why you were
feeling so much pain.

16:50.068 --> 16:52.493
AJ, the rest of his vessels
are pristine.

16:52.495 --> 16:55.571
Cholesterol's low,
no family history...

16:55.573 --> 16:57.573
CONRAD:
And it looks like the stent
was placed in the location

16:57.575 --> 17:00.426
of a coronary artery dissection.
Are we thinking the same thing?

17:00.428 --> 17:02.411
AUSTIN:
Yeah. It sickens me

17:02.413 --> 17:03.837
to say this,

17:03.839 --> 17:06.415
but you never should have had
a cath in the first place.

17:06.417 --> 17:09.510
Worse, the cardiologist
tore blood vessels

17:09.512 --> 17:12.363
when he put it in, which is why
the procedure was so painful.

17:12.365 --> 17:15.033
I should prepare
to see my maker.

17:15.035 --> 17:16.759
No need to pack your bags.

17:16.761 --> 17:19.537
You will get to your next
great achievement.

17:21.766 --> 17:23.282
Aaron,

17:23.284 --> 17:25.710
what was the name
of your cardiologist?

17:28.197 --> 17:29.672
(knock on door)

17:32.552 --> 17:33.367
Eliza,

17:33.369 --> 17:35.628
this is Dr. Billie Sutton,

17:35.630 --> 17:37.463
and she is a neurosurgeon,

17:37.465 --> 17:39.540
and I've asked her to come here
and talk to you.

17:39.542 --> 17:40.633
Hi, Eliza.

17:40.635 --> 17:42.560
I've seen that expression

17:42.562 --> 17:44.062
on your face too many times.

17:44.064 --> 17:46.972
You have a plan to fix me,

17:46.974 --> 17:49.692
but I am unfixable.

17:51.479 --> 17:53.462
I don't want to go
through this again.

17:53.464 --> 17:55.648
I-I get that.

17:55.650 --> 17:57.742
And, truth be told,
my plan might not work.

17:57.744 --> 18:00.727
DEVON:
The success rate
of deep brain stimulation

18:00.729 --> 18:02.305
for depression is about 50%.

18:02.307 --> 18:04.248
That is a broad definition
of success,

18:04.250 --> 18:07.810
from modest improvement
to complete absence

18:07.812 --> 18:09.161
of symptoms.

18:09.163 --> 18:11.547
Deep brain stimulation?

18:13.484 --> 18:15.426
A small conductor, an electrode,

18:15.428 --> 18:18.337
is permanently placed in a
specific region of the brain.

18:18.339 --> 18:21.173
The conductor carries a
low-level impulse from a battery

18:21.175 --> 18:22.675
to the area of the brain
that regulates mood.

18:22.677 --> 18:24.585
What could possibly go wrong?

18:24.587 --> 18:27.830
In very rare circumstances,
a hemorrhage can occur.

18:29.016 --> 18:32.685
Wh-Which would conceivably
turn me into a can of peas.

18:32.687 --> 18:36.430
Well, like I said,
that outcome is very rare,

18:36.432 --> 18:37.598
and I'm very good at this.

18:37.600 --> 18:39.859
And here's the part
you might like...

18:39.861 --> 18:41.360
Can't imagine
what that would be.

18:41.362 --> 18:43.788
Well, first we have
to scan your brain.

18:43.790 --> 18:46.457
Then, I give you a tour
of the organ

18:46.459 --> 18:49.276
that's not only the source
of your literary success,

18:49.278 --> 18:51.187
but the thing
that wants you dead.

18:51.189 --> 18:53.464
I'll pull some strings
to get you out

18:53.466 --> 18:56.134
-of the ER while you wait.
-ELIZA: Mm.

18:57.971 --> 19:01.030
We'll be back.

19:01.032 --> 19:03.032
(door opens)

19:03.034 --> 19:04.550
(door closes)

19:04.552 --> 19:05.959
Aaron is stable,

19:05.961 --> 19:08.312
but I can't undo the injury
his heart has sustained.

19:08.314 --> 19:11.207
Once a blood vessel's been torn,
it can tear again.

19:11.209 --> 19:14.059
And an acute clot could form,

19:14.061 --> 19:15.820
cause him more heart attacks.

19:15.822 --> 19:17.730
His cardiac function
has decreased

19:17.732 --> 19:19.398
to only a third
of what it should be.

19:19.400 --> 19:21.975
-In time, it could improve.
-It's all wrong,

19:21.977 --> 19:23.477
and the worst part is,

19:23.479 --> 19:26.238
the procedure
was entirely unnecessary.

19:26.240 --> 19:28.724
Look, I got a quick errand
I got to run.

19:28.726 --> 19:30.334
I'll be back as fast as I can.

19:30.336 --> 19:33.062
I'll hold the pastor in the ER,
keep an eye on him.

19:33.064 --> 19:35.464
-Yeah, man.
-I'll update you.

19:47.020 --> 19:48.835
This is the cerebrum...

19:48.837 --> 19:51.430
(machine beeps)

19:51.432 --> 19:53.098
...where consciousness,
emotion, perception,

19:53.100 --> 19:56.194
and memory are all integrated.

19:56.196 --> 19:58.362
Like any other part of the body,

19:58.364 --> 20:02.033
pathways of connections
can be too strong or too weak,

20:02.035 --> 20:03.367
and when they are weak, we try

20:03.369 --> 20:04.760
to augment them
with medications,

20:04.762 --> 20:06.595
you know, SSRIs, ECT...

20:06.597 --> 20:09.040
-But those didn't work.
-Which is why we get

20:09.042 --> 20:10.541
to try something more intense.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.877
We would place electrodes

20:12.879 --> 20:15.120
here and here.

20:15.122 --> 20:17.606
Like a pacemaker for the brain

20:17.608 --> 20:19.291
instead of the heart.

20:19.293 --> 20:21.777
The electrodes stimulate
Brodmann area 25,

20:21.779 --> 20:24.871
which is like the interstate
highway of nerve connections,

20:24.873 --> 20:26.298
or white matter,

20:26.300 --> 20:28.284
and it's sitting right on top

20:28.286 --> 20:30.561
of a huge serotonin depot.

20:30.563 --> 20:33.898
It's like drilling
for a well of happiness.

20:33.900 --> 20:37.293
If you like that image.

20:37.295 --> 20:40.887
Reminds me of those
flimsy claws at arcades

20:40.889 --> 20:44.633
that kids dump their money into
and try to grab a prize,

20:44.635 --> 20:46.577
but they never get one.

20:46.579 --> 20:50.706
Well, DBS has much higher odds
of success than those claws.

20:52.643 --> 20:54.477
Define success.

20:54.479 --> 20:57.088
We banish the hell in your head

20:57.090 --> 20:58.981
but keep the heavenly talent.

20:58.983 --> 21:01.092
I won't wake up

21:01.094 --> 21:03.427
and be someone else,

21:03.429 --> 21:05.596
will I?

21:05.598 --> 21:08.516
Everyone facing DBS
asks that question.

21:09.585 --> 21:11.686
Surely not everybody.

21:13.347 --> 21:15.422
Look, they say
in Alcoholics Anonymous,

21:15.424 --> 21:17.424
if you sober up a horse thief,

21:17.426 --> 21:19.485
all you have is
a sober horse thief.

21:20.929 --> 21:23.005
You will remain you,

21:23.007 --> 21:24.991
but a happy you.

21:27.695 --> 21:30.162
You're describing a stranger.

21:32.366 --> 21:34.366
<i> AUSTIN:</i>
<i> You know, I really</i>
<i> appreciate you</i>

21:34.368 --> 21:36.869
making time for me
on such short notice,

21:36.871 --> 21:38.187
Dr. Pellington.

21:38.205 --> 21:39.688
Well, I'm glad we could
make it work, Mr. Austin.

21:39.690 --> 21:42.300
Now, as you know, we took
a picture of your heart

21:42.302 --> 21:45.044
a few minutes ago,
I sure am glad we did.

21:45.046 --> 21:47.196
It revealed some extra beats.

21:47.198 --> 21:48.697
Now, we have
a fancy term for that.

21:48.699 --> 21:51.033
It's called premature
ventricular contractions,

21:51.035 --> 21:53.035
but the important thing is,

21:53.037 --> 21:54.537
it may have shown a blockage

21:54.539 --> 21:56.705
in your arteries
that feed blood to your heart,

21:56.707 --> 21:58.965
and that's the first step
to a heart attack.

21:58.967 --> 22:01.377
Whoa, a heart attack.

22:01.379 --> 22:03.896
(sighs) C-Can I take
a look at that?

22:03.898 --> 22:06.306
-Oh, sure, sure.
-Thanks.

22:06.308 --> 22:08.384
You are one lucky man

22:08.386 --> 22:10.569
because we can do
a cardiac cath.

22:10.571 --> 22:11.996
That's a procedure

22:11.998 --> 22:14.165
where we can get a better view
of those arteries,

22:14.167 --> 22:15.816
and if there is blockages,

22:15.818 --> 22:17.984
which I suspect there will be,

22:17.986 --> 22:20.563
we can open 'em right up.
Any questions?

22:20.565 --> 22:22.915
Yeah, just one.

22:22.917 --> 22:26.068
Did you go into medicine
intending to become a fraud?

22:26.070 --> 22:27.753
Excuse me?

22:27.755 --> 22:30.089
I'm a cardiothoracic surgeon

22:30.091 --> 22:32.016
at Chastain Park Memorial,

22:32.018 --> 22:34.093
and you and I both know that

22:34.095 --> 22:35.594
my EKG is normal.

22:35.596 --> 22:38.338
There is no medical reason
to take me to cath,

22:38.340 --> 22:41.266
just like there wasn't
for Pastor Aaron either.

22:41.268 --> 22:42.418
I could point to hundreds...

22:42.420 --> 22:45.270
Pastor Aaron is in our ICU

22:45.272 --> 22:47.365
right now as a result
of the botched stent

22:47.367 --> 22:49.516
you put in when you dissected

22:49.518 --> 22:53.204
his LAD during
an unnecessary cath.

22:53.206 --> 22:55.431
So, not only are you greedy,

22:55.433 --> 22:57.766
you are incompetent at best.

22:57.768 --> 23:00.285
I don't know what the hell
you think you're getting at,

23:00.287 --> 23:02.028
but everything I did is legal.

23:02.030 --> 23:04.715
Legal? Really?

23:04.717 --> 23:08.260
You know, that's a pretty
low bar for a doctor.

23:09.964 --> 23:11.055
I'll tell you what,

23:11.057 --> 23:13.949
Pellington,

23:13.951 --> 23:15.951
if my friend takes a turn
for the worse,

23:15.953 --> 23:19.788
you will find yourself
on the losing end of a lawsuit

23:19.790 --> 23:22.733
with me as the expert witness.

23:25.980 --> 23:27.980
Aaron.

23:27.982 --> 23:29.465
How you doing?

23:29.467 --> 23:31.617
I was just working
on next week's sermon.

23:33.246 --> 23:35.246
You know, today's been
all about me,

23:35.248 --> 23:37.489
and earlier you mentioned
about being pulled back in

23:37.491 --> 23:40.400
the pain of your wife's death,
before we got interrupted.

23:40.402 --> 23:42.494
And it will continue
to be all about you.

23:42.496 --> 23:45.238
Numbers look good.
Any chest pain?

23:45.240 --> 23:47.541
Ah, nothing significant.

23:48.428 --> 23:51.487
You and I are in
the "you" business.

23:51.489 --> 23:54.247
-You let me do my job.
-(chuckling)

23:54.249 --> 23:56.600
This resurgence of grief,

23:56.602 --> 23:59.328
have you had any big recent
changes in your life?

23:59.330 --> 24:02.982
Crazy work stuff the past week.

24:04.669 --> 24:06.426
(exhales) Have you been

24:06.428 --> 24:08.487
stepping out with any women
since Nic's death?

24:08.489 --> 24:12.691
Eh... one. Nothing serious.
Potentially others.

24:12.693 --> 24:14.843
-They all come
with complications.
-Yeah.

24:14.845 --> 24:18.438
Yeah, and I'm sure that you had
those complications with Nic.

24:18.440 --> 24:20.866
Yeah, but the baggage
was mostly mine.

24:20.868 --> 24:21.959
(laughs)

24:21.961 --> 24:23.702
You know, my experience with

24:23.704 --> 24:27.022
counseling widowers is that
guilt and loyalty

24:27.024 --> 24:30.092
can toss you back
into the original grief.

24:31.954 --> 24:33.637
Maybe.

24:33.639 --> 24:35.473
Hey.

24:35.475 --> 24:36.807
If it's this woman,

24:36.809 --> 24:39.535
or if it's that woman,
you deserve

24:39.537 --> 24:41.386
your next
great romantic achievement.

24:41.388 --> 24:43.439
(heart monitor beeping rapidly)

24:44.633 --> 24:46.725
Patient's in V tach!
I need a crash cart!

24:46.727 --> 24:48.986
(groans)

24:50.656 --> 24:54.399
He's pulseless. Now in V fib.

24:54.401 --> 24:57.495
We need to shock.
Get the pads on.

25:03.394 --> 25:04.226
(grunts)

25:04.228 --> 25:06.319
Charging. And clear.

25:06.321 --> 25:09.064
Now.

25:09.066 --> 25:11.342
Still in V fib.

25:11.344 --> 25:13.427
Get me a bolus of amio
and shock again.

25:16.073 --> 25:18.015
(Conrad grunts)

25:20.761 --> 25:22.002
Charging.

25:22.004 --> 25:24.230
Clear. And shock.

25:25.583 --> 25:26.598
(Aaron gasps)

25:26.600 --> 25:29.434
-He has a pulse.
-HUNDLEY: Sinus rhythm.

25:29.436 --> 25:32.087
But if this happens again,
he is not...

25:32.089 --> 25:34.347
When it happens again,
he won't survive it.

25:34.349 --> 25:37.993
Let's get him to the ICU.
I'll page AJ.

25:43.692 --> 25:46.210
-Hey, what's going on?
-I got him out of V fib, but...

25:46.212 --> 25:49.421
Hey. Right here,
I got you, brother.

25:53.219 --> 25:56.612
His left ventricle
is barely contracting.

25:56.614 --> 25:58.964
Down to about 15%.
He couldn't tolerate

25:58.966 --> 26:00.282
the refractory arrhythmia.

26:00.284 --> 26:02.208
We can't fix
his coronary arteries

26:02.210 --> 26:04.544
with more stents.
They're too damaged.

26:04.546 --> 26:07.456
I'm gonna have to take a vessel
from his chest and go around it.

26:07.458 --> 26:11.460
From an unnecessary cath
to open-heart surgery.

26:11.462 --> 26:13.462
(monitor beeps)

26:13.464 --> 26:15.480
(sighs)

26:15.482 --> 26:18.300
His systolic's
dropping to the 60s.

26:18.302 --> 26:19.559
I need more pressure than that

26:19.561 --> 26:22.154
-to do surgery.
-I'm maxed out on pressors.

26:22.156 --> 26:25.157
We're gonna have to
put him on ECMO.

26:25.159 --> 26:28.143
Wh-What's going on, fellas?

26:28.145 --> 26:30.904
AJ needs to perform
bypass surgery,

26:30.906 --> 26:32.238
so we're gonna
put you on a machine

26:32.240 --> 26:33.665
that will take over
for your heart,

26:33.667 --> 26:36.501
so your heart can survive
the procedure, okay?

26:36.503 --> 26:39.988
If God wants me
at His table right now,

26:39.990 --> 26:41.765
I have faith in Him.

26:41.767 --> 26:44.159
Have faith in me.

26:44.161 --> 26:46.753
I'm gonna do my best to make you
late for that dinner.

26:46.755 --> 26:48.647
You hear me?

26:50.684 --> 26:54.445
I am glad to see that you
agreed to the DBS.

26:54.447 --> 26:57.281
Of course, you'll be
under psychiatric care

26:57.283 --> 26:59.599
for some time
after the surgery, but...

26:59.601 --> 27:01.601
have you thought about

27:01.603 --> 27:03.120
what kind of support
you're gonna need

27:03.122 --> 27:04.663
when you get back
into your life?

27:06.959 --> 27:08.325
Well, if this works,

27:08.327 --> 27:11.186
I'll be happy, right? So...

27:11.188 --> 27:12.963
I won't need anything.

27:13.966 --> 27:15.207
I started reading
your first book.

27:15.209 --> 27:18.385
Hmm. Enjoy it while you can.

27:19.788 --> 27:22.531
And that description
of the conversation that you had

27:22.533 --> 27:25.291
with your therapist after
your first suicide attempt...

27:25.293 --> 27:28.553
About falling in love with

27:28.555 --> 27:30.630
my depression.

27:30.632 --> 27:32.541
DEVON:
Yeah.

27:32.543 --> 27:34.526
It's hard to conceive of that.

27:35.729 --> 27:38.638
Well, for most people, it's...

27:38.640 --> 27:40.640
impossible, which is...

27:40.642 --> 27:43.568
why this is all so futile.

27:43.570 --> 27:44.903
(monitor beeping)

27:44.905 --> 27:46.405
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

27:46.407 --> 27:48.999
Yeah, I'm just, I'm just tired.

27:49.985 --> 27:53.128
This is so weird.

27:55.582 --> 27:57.841
-Eliza?
-Hmm? Yeah.

27:57.843 --> 27:59.426
Hey.

28:01.347 --> 28:04.181
My God, she pulled out
her A-line!

28:04.183 --> 28:06.266
I need another set
of hands in here!

28:07.261 --> 28:09.728
Eliza, I'm not letting you go.

28:10.856 --> 28:12.856
Please...

28:12.858 --> 28:14.983
give us a chance.

28:18.013 --> 28:21.699
Okay, so, remember, stay calm,
avoid an accusatory tone.

28:21.701 --> 28:24.593
But just share your truth.

28:24.595 --> 28:26.428
Yeah. Okay.

28:26.430 --> 28:29.206
I'm nervous, but I can do that.

28:31.210 --> 28:32.935
I wouldn't put you
in front of these people

28:32.937 --> 28:34.937
if I didn't think
you could reach them.

28:34.939 --> 28:36.714
Okay.

28:36.716 --> 28:38.966
Okay. All right. Here we go.

28:48.060 --> 28:50.043
I'm gonna move that chair.

28:50.045 --> 28:52.521
Just the top of the table.

28:54.233 --> 28:55.899
Okay.

28:55.901 --> 28:58.126
ELKINS:
Uh...

28:58.128 --> 28:59.570
Who is this woman, Dr. Bell?

28:59.572 --> 29:01.930
You didn't mention that you were
bringing a guest this morning.

29:01.932 --> 29:03.298
BELL:
This is Emily Benesch.

29:03.300 --> 29:06.468
She's gonna tell us her story,

29:06.470 --> 29:07.953
and we are going to listen.

29:09.397 --> 29:11.564
EMILY:
The last time I walked
on my own two feet,

29:11.566 --> 29:15.043
it was into
Dr. Bosley's practice.

29:16.404 --> 29:17.996
The man I was engaged to marry

29:17.998 --> 29:20.424
left me
after I was paralyzed.

29:25.765 --> 29:27.598
(exhales)

29:30.160 --> 29:32.995
I can't... (sighs)
turn over in bed,

29:32.997 --> 29:35.163
reach a book on the shelf,

29:35.165 --> 29:36.999
get out of my house, into a car,

29:37.001 --> 29:41.019
through a store
without pain and struggle.

29:41.021 --> 29:43.071
And why?

29:44.099 --> 29:46.099
Because no one stopped a man

29:46.101 --> 29:49.995
who should never have been
operating to begin with.

29:51.198 --> 29:54.683
You sit in here and review
his explanations.

29:54.685 --> 29:56.126
Accidents happen,

29:56.128 --> 29:58.545
but again and again?

30:00.115 --> 30:02.257
Who else will end up like me?

30:04.695 --> 30:07.787
Would you send your wife to him?

30:07.789 --> 30:10.198
Your son?

30:10.200 --> 30:12.050
Your father?

30:12.052 --> 30:14.311
Then why a stranger?

30:15.463 --> 30:18.798
I know that a very high
percentage of doctors

30:18.800 --> 30:20.876
are-are competent

30:20.878 --> 30:22.635
and good people.

30:22.637 --> 30:25.564
And the few who ruin

30:25.566 --> 30:27.399
people's lives,

30:27.401 --> 30:30.977
they're-- are repeat offenders.

30:30.979 --> 30:33.038
Like Dr. Bosley.

30:34.166 --> 30:37.167
If a hundred good doctors
do nothing

30:37.169 --> 30:39.728
about one bad one,

30:39.730 --> 30:42.256
then we've got 101 bad doctors.

30:44.751 --> 30:47.160
You owe it to yourselves.

30:47.162 --> 30:49.513
You owe it to me.

30:54.595 --> 30:56.728
Thank you, Emily.

30:58.506 --> 31:02.417
We'll pass this up to
the complaint division and...

31:02.419 --> 31:05.270
discuss the status
of the investigation

31:05.272 --> 31:08.699
on a weekly basis.

31:08.701 --> 31:10.492
Thank you.

31:24.458 --> 31:27.200
The ECMO's giving his heart
some relief,

31:27.202 --> 31:29.702
but this is as strong
as he's gonna get.

31:29.704 --> 31:32.038
If I don't operate now,
there might not be

31:32.040 --> 31:34.540
-any heart muscle left to save.
-Yeah, it's time.

31:34.542 --> 31:38.395
Let's hope he's strong enough
to survive.

32:02.479 --> 32:05.330
All right, the first graft
is complete.

32:05.332 --> 32:08.241
This LAD is gonna be
a little tougher.

32:08.243 --> 32:09.968
4.0 Prolene to me.

32:15.267 --> 32:18.435
Suturing over the dissection.

32:19.496 --> 32:21.254
CHU:
You're using both internal

32:21.256 --> 32:23.515
mammary arteries for grafts.

32:23.517 --> 32:25.609
Is there a risk
of recurring heart disease?

32:25.611 --> 32:28.003
Oh, good question, Chu.

32:28.005 --> 32:30.739
Not in a man who doesn't
actually have heart disease.

32:33.026 --> 32:35.527
Both anastomoses complete.

32:35.529 --> 32:37.204
Removing the clamp.

32:41.852 --> 32:44.461
CHU:
Let me know when you're ready.

32:47.874 --> 32:51.117
I am in position.

32:51.119 --> 32:53.286
Let's hit the reset button

32:53.288 --> 32:56.381
on the good pastor's
new and improved heart.

32:56.383 --> 32:58.058
-Starting with five joules.
-(whirring)

33:03.131 --> 33:05.524
-CHU: Going up to ten.
-(beeping)

33:07.060 --> 33:10.237
(whirring)

33:12.566 --> 33:14.974
(Austin sighs)

33:14.976 --> 33:17.077
Take it to 20.

33:18.831 --> 33:20.580
(beeping)

33:23.076 --> 33:25.460
(whirring)

33:29.566 --> 33:31.258
Come on.

33:33.995 --> 33:35.679
(sighs)

33:40.927 --> 33:43.261
BILLIE:
I'm placing the electrode.

33:43.263 --> 33:46.081
Now, there are no pain receptors
in the brain,

33:46.083 --> 33:47.858
so this won't hurt.

33:47.860 --> 33:49.192
That's ironic.

33:50.420 --> 33:52.362
BILLIE:
Advancing the electrode.

33:52.364 --> 33:55.106
60 millimeters.

33:55.108 --> 33:58.535
78 millimeters.

34:01.765 --> 34:04.766
We're at the target region.

34:04.768 --> 34:06.451
Dr. Malco?

34:06.453 --> 34:07.544
Pass it over to me.

34:07.546 --> 34:11.456
For what it's worth,
I feel no different.

34:11.458 --> 34:13.625
I...

34:13.627 --> 34:15.126
maybe feel worse, even.

34:15.128 --> 34:16.628
Perhaps because now

34:16.630 --> 34:19.205
my head is screwed
into a metal frame.

34:19.207 --> 34:21.707
We haven't turned it on
yet, Eliza.

34:21.709 --> 34:25.062
-That's what I'm about to do.
-ELIZA: Oh.

34:25.064 --> 34:27.789
-(machine beeps)
-Two volts.

34:27.791 --> 34:31.401
Eliza, rate your mood
on a scale of zero to ten.

34:31.403 --> 34:32.736
Unchanged.

34:32.738 --> 34:35.964
Zero.

34:35.966 --> 34:39.725
Adjusting to four volts.

34:39.727 --> 34:42.537
And now?

34:44.899 --> 34:46.583
Nothing.

34:49.404 --> 34:52.047
-(machine beeps)
-Six volts.

34:53.592 --> 34:55.634
Eliza, how about now?

34:57.078 --> 35:00.138
Eliza, are you okay?

35:02.935 --> 35:04.392
I'm...

35:05.345 --> 35:07.011
-I'm...
-MALCO: Eliza, if we

35:07.013 --> 35:09.106
-went too far we can
turn it back down.
-ELIZA: No.

35:09.108 --> 35:12.091
No. Don't-don't-don't
turn it back down.

35:12.093 --> 35:13.668
Don't-don't...

35:13.670 --> 35:16.095
Don't do anything.

35:16.097 --> 35:18.949
Tell us how you feel, Eliza.

35:18.951 --> 35:21.100
ELIZA:
I feel calm?

35:21.102 --> 35:23.620
Everything...

35:23.622 --> 35:26.665
everything seems... brighter.

35:28.368 --> 35:30.702
(chuckles)

35:30.704 --> 35:33.355
Is...?

35:33.357 --> 35:36.133
Could this be... (chuckles)

35:36.135 --> 35:39.377
Could this be happiness?

35:39.379 --> 35:41.221
(chuckles)

35:51.507 --> 35:54.042
Well, against all odds,
Aaron's alive

35:54.044 --> 35:55.894
with plenty more sermons
to give.

35:55.896 --> 35:58.062
Yeah, well,
it's a flawed victory.

35:58.064 --> 35:59.564
His heart
is permanently damaged,

35:59.566 --> 36:01.491
and he'll spend the rest
of his life exhausted.

36:01.493 --> 36:05.236
All because of unnecessary tests
and useless procedures

36:05.238 --> 36:06.905
that were detrimental
to his health.

36:06.907 --> 36:09.499
You know, I talked to Bell, now
that he's on the medical board.

36:09.501 --> 36:13.061
Ah, let me guess.
The system is so broken,

36:13.063 --> 36:15.063
Pellington won't face
any ramifications.

36:15.065 --> 36:16.464
Bingo.

36:17.918 --> 36:20.418
There's literally
nothing we can do.

36:20.420 --> 36:23.087
Maybe not, but there
is always karma.

36:23.089 --> 36:24.664

and what we do,

37:09.377 --> 37:11.561
just...

37:11.563 --> 37:15.047
watching people slide

37:15.049 --> 37:17.984
while we fight to save them.

37:19.387 --> 37:21.463
Yeah.

37:21.465 --> 37:25.224

37:37.147 --> 37:39.238
for my mother's passing.

37:39.240 --> 37:42.484
And when she does, I...

37:42.486 --> 37:44.261
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

37:44.263 --> 37:47.472
I know I'll never know
another like her.

37:48.934 --> 37:50.492
No.

37:51.495 --> 37:54.688
There are some holes

Go ahead, ask.

38:09.529 --> 38:11.204
How are you feeling?

38:12.124 --> 38:13.272
(laughs):
Good.

38:13.274 --> 38:16.851
Weird. Um, hopeful.

38:16.853 --> 38:19.370
Scared. Bionic.

38:19.372 --> 38:21.631
I feel like I'm at one
of those all-you-can-eat

38:21.633 --> 38:25.376
buffet restaurants,
only it's for emotions.

38:25.378 --> 38:26.861
(chuckles)

38:26.863 --> 38:28.972
Sounds dizzying,

38:28.974 --> 38:30.640
but an improvement.

38:31.885 --> 38:34.886
Dr. Malco has a few options for
psychiatric treatment centers,

38:34.888 --> 38:36.387
and they all accept
your insurance,

38:36.389 --> 38:37.797
and they're gonna
take you right away.

38:37.799 --> 38:40.542
BILLIE:
You'll come back
and see me in two weeks,

38:40.544 --> 38:43.236
and I'll adjust your stim level
if necessary.

38:44.731 --> 38:47.215
Okay.

38:47.217 --> 38:49.492
Uh, thank you...

38:50.645 --> 38:52.662
...for not letting me go.

38:53.890 --> 38:55.457
Of course.

39:05.569 --> 39:08.994
Days like this,
I love being a doctor.

39:08.996 --> 39:11.639
-Best job in the world.
-(chuckles)

39:19.265 --> 39:21.099
Bell.

39:21.101 --> 39:23.526
Bell, Bell, Bell.

39:23.528 --> 39:26.104
You know, I thought
I had the deepest,

39:26.106 --> 39:27.697
highest-octane reservoir

39:27.699 --> 39:31.593
of ego, but, brother,
your vanity makes mine blush.

39:31.595 --> 39:34.095
CONRAD:
Randolph, you are my friend,

39:34.097 --> 39:36.539
but it's a good thing
you don't have cancer

39:36.541 --> 39:38.433
because you are not
a good enough friend

39:38.435 --> 39:40.025
for me to shave off this.
I mean, this is like a silken

39:40.027 --> 39:43.438
-masterpiece up here.
-AUSTIN: That it is, it is.
-KIT: Ooh.

39:43.440 --> 39:45.006
So...

39:46.033 --> 39:48.009
What do you say?

39:49.888 --> 39:51.796
Okay, I will take this...

39:51.798 --> 39:53.890
walking stick,

39:53.892 --> 39:55.725
but not because
I'm old or infirm,

39:55.727 --> 39:58.061
but because it's really cool.

39:58.063 --> 39:59.787
(laughter)

39:59.789 --> 40:02.649
-Thanks, guys.
-You got it.

40:22.236 --> 40:24.087
Well, you look good.

40:25.757 --> 40:27.257
You okay?

40:27.259 --> 40:29.408
I am.

40:29.410 --> 40:31.052
I'm good.

40:39.846 --> 40:42.063
(Trevor sighs)

40:42.999 --> 40:44.691
So, what's going on?

40:45.852 --> 40:47.527
Okay, first...

40:49.189 --> 40:51.597
I'm not sure
I want to be a doctor.

40:51.599 --> 40:55.285
I went into it
for the wrong reasons.

40:56.680 --> 40:58.496
Why did you go into it?

41:03.870 --> 41:06.871
I wanted to be the person
I thought you'd love enough

41:06.873 --> 41:09.299
to wish you'd kept me.

41:09.301 --> 41:12.193
Now I realize you were a child.

41:12.195 --> 41:14.286
That's why you couldn't keep me.

41:14.288 --> 41:17.098
I know we both suffered.

41:20.887 --> 41:23.813
Right now
it feels like being a doctor

41:23.815 --> 41:25.648
won't give me what it gives you.

41:28.211 --> 41:31.062
The good news is, being an M.D.

41:31.064 --> 41:34.048
opens up a lot of opportunities.

41:34.050 --> 41:36.475
Yeah. I...

41:36.477 --> 41:39.496
got a job in
research and development

41:39.498 --> 41:41.146
at a biotech start-up.

41:41.148 --> 41:43.983
Drug chemistry, my sweet spot.

41:43.985 --> 41:47.061
But I'm gonna do it,
you know, by the rules.

41:47.063 --> 41:50.248
-(both chuckle)
-Try to make a difference.

41:50.250 --> 41:53.176
I don't know.
We'll see what happens.

41:55.588 --> 41:57.597
I'm happy for you, Trevor.

41:59.592 --> 42:02.060
And I'm very proud.

42:03.188 --> 42:05.170
Yeah, since Porter,

42:05.172 --> 42:07.415
since giving you away, I...

42:07.417 --> 42:09.526
It had been inconceivable to me

42:09.528 --> 42:12.529
that I could ever feel maternal
towards anyone.

42:14.015 --> 42:15.990
I never wanted kids.

42:17.460 --> 42:18.943
But you forced me to meet you,

42:18.945 --> 42:21.112
and what had been inconceivable
happened.

42:21.114 --> 42:24.432
Something opened up in me.
No, these last couple

42:24.434 --> 42:27.602
of weeks, when I didn't know
where you were,

42:27.604 --> 42:29.695
what you were doing...

42:29.697 --> 42:32.173
I was beside myself with worry.

42:34.535 --> 42:37.220
Which I suspect means
I was feeling a little bit

42:37.222 --> 42:39.180
like a real mother.

42:46.064 --> 42:48.731
You are my son.

42:48.733 --> 42:51.526
Nothing can ever change that.

42:52.887 --> 42:54.571
And I love you.
