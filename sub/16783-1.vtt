WEBVTT

00:06.314 --> 00:09.647
So how'd it go last night?
Oh, no!

00:09.718 --> 00:12.278
- Would you hand me that?
- Nice gloves. Are they new?

00:12.353 --> 00:15.811
What do you got when you
have a lawyer up to his neck in cement?

00:15.890 --> 00:17.824
- Your boyfriend out of jail yet?
- Not yet.

00:17.892 --> 00:20.292
Jack, one guess.

00:20.361 --> 00:23.990
Four Seasons. That's easy.
What's the flip side?

00:24.065 --> 00:27.501
Flip side? Flip side.
What is the flip side?

00:27.569 --> 00:30.163
Oh, shit, now my whole day's ruined.

00:30.238 --> 00:32.103
Is everything laid out?

00:32.173 --> 00:34.038
Everything you like.

00:34.109 --> 00:37.545
Oh, these are my favorites.

00:42.617 --> 00:45.848
- What's the story on our friend?
- He jumped, five floors.

00:45.920 --> 00:48.013
Oh, good grief.

00:48.089 --> 00:51.149
What do you want on this?
Pickle, lettuce, tomato? Onion?

00:51.226 --> 00:53.091
What do you want?
Want a coke? No coke?

00:53.161 --> 00:55.994
No, use more Betadine, sweetheart.
He needs the color.

00:56.064 --> 00:58.862
Let's go, Jack. I'm having trouble
keeping his pressure up.

00:58.933 --> 01:02.460
Just splash and slash.

01:02.537 --> 01:05.870
You know, Murray, they ought
to teach a course in suicide technique.

01:05.940 --> 01:11.071
I mean, five floors
is just not good enough.

01:12.547 --> 01:16.950
People use the wrong knife,
can't tie a decent knot. It's terrible.

01:17.018 --> 01:19.816
Nancy, when are you gonna run away
with me? I'm desperate.

01:19.888 --> 01:21.651
I can't eat. I can't sleep.

01:21.723 --> 01:26.922
OK. Blade.

01:32.867 --> 01:36.928
I'm going right in.
We'll tidy up on the way out.

01:44.979 --> 01:48.244
Oh, look at that. You made him bleed.

01:48.316 --> 01:50.443
Retractor.

01:54.489 --> 01:58.949
- Oh, boy, he's a gusher.
- I hate blood.

01:59.027 --> 02:03.691
Cell-saver suction. Malleable, Nancy.

02:03.765 --> 02:05.858
The BP's dropping all the time.
I can't keep up with his loss.

02:05.934 --> 02:10.064
This guy's aorta is in big trouble.
Cut down on the ventilation, Joe.

02:10.138 --> 02:13.539
- Move the lung out of the way.
- OK, I'm hand-ventilating.

02:16.644 --> 02:18.805
Oh, shit.

02:20.114 --> 02:22.981
The aorta's completely transected.

02:24.719 --> 02:27.882
- What do you wanna do?
- Turn off the music.

02:27.956 --> 02:31.119
Clamp and run.
Give me a 20-millimeter Dacron graft.

02:31.191 --> 02:32.954
On my way.

02:33.026 --> 02:36.086
Clamp? Thank you.

02:36.163 --> 02:40.190
- We need some over here.
- I'm getting in a clamp above.

02:40.267 --> 02:46.103
- Snap!
- Clamp. I'm getting in a clamp below...

02:46.173 --> 02:49.108
- I got it, I got it.
- Start the clock!

02:49.176 --> 02:51.041
OK. Take this, will you?
Get it. Take it out.

02:51.111 --> 02:53.102
Graft.

02:55.282 --> 02:57.375
I got it.

03:01.288 --> 03:04.746
- 4-0 Prolene, let's go!
- 4-0 Prolene, Doctor.

03:04.892 --> 03:08.828
- Give him more blood, Joe.
- He's got all we had. We sent for more.

03:08.896 --> 03:11.729
Knit one.

03:11.798 --> 03:15.199
He's 60 over zip.
But we still have a cardiac rhythm.

03:15.269 --> 03:17.464
Not for long.

03:17.537 --> 03:21.234
- Nancy, are my hands shaking?
- No, Doctor.

03:21.308 --> 03:24.243
That's amazing.
I always tremble when you're near.

03:27.047 --> 03:31.006
You've got about three minutes, Jack,
and then he's in big trouble.

03:33.887 --> 03:35.821
What's the difference between a...

03:35.889 --> 03:38.016
Nancy, if you know this one,
don't say anything.

03:38.091 --> 03:42.357
What's the difference between
a lawyer and a catfish?

03:44.831 --> 03:47.095
- You know?
- No idea.

03:47.167 --> 03:53.106
One is a scum-sucking bottom dweller...
and the other one's a fish.

04:00.714 --> 04:04.206
- Right over left and under.
- Left over right and under.

04:04.284 --> 04:06.275
Good scout.

04:07.321 --> 04:13.385
OK, here we go. I'm going
to unclamp slowly. Watch the BP.

04:14.561 --> 04:17.724
- Clamp.
- Easy.

04:17.798 --> 04:22.826
- Off.
- No leaks. We made it.

04:22.903 --> 04:24.894
Looks beautiful.

04:24.972 --> 04:28.430
Ooo-wee!

04:28.508 --> 04:32.501
Let's pack our bags, guys,
and go home. Closing music, Joe.

04:32.579 --> 04:37.573
Oh, that was great, everybody.
And, Nancy, I wanna hear you sing.

04:37.651 --> 04:38.879
Sure, Doctor.

04:48.729 --> 04:51.562
Nancy, you're not singing, doll.

04:51.631 --> 04:58.002
One day, Nancy, one day before I die,
you're gonna sing for me.

04:58.705 --> 04:59.967
Doctor, please.

05:03.210 --> 05:07.613
Sing it. Sing it, buddy! You're gonna
be OK. What's this kid's name?

05:23.230 --> 05:26.825
Sing it, Nancy, baby.

05:27.167 --> 05:30.295
Dr. MacKee? Dr. Blumfield
would like you to stop by OR 2

05:30.370 --> 05:31.837
and take a look at his patient.

05:31.905 --> 05:37.502
- Wow. Where ENT meets ESP.
- Rabbi calls. Go take a look.

05:37.577 --> 05:39.909
- The spirits wait.
- Will you finish up here?

05:39.980 --> 05:43.108
My pleasure. Don't forget your crystals.

05:43.183 --> 05:45.777
Or a Ouija board.

05:45.852 --> 05:50.050
Jack, you throw the wildest parties.
Come on, little doggie.

05:50.123 --> 05:53.149
Come on, fella, wake this kid up.
Have him join us.

05:53.226 --> 05:57.856
When that boy wakes up, tell him,
next time, ten floors minimum.

05:57.931 --> 06:00.923
- Reach for the sky!
- Look out!

06:01.001 --> 06:04.027
You hear that, boy?
That was Dr. Jack MacKee.

06:04.104 --> 06:07.005
- I need a gown.
- Here you go.

06:09.476 --> 06:11.467
Here, Doctor.

06:16.149 --> 06:21.382
Thank you for coming, Doctor.
I've got a rigid bronchoscopy, and...

06:21.455 --> 06:27.360
I'd like you to take a look. I think I found
a lesion in the right main bronchus.

06:28.228 --> 06:31.061
- He's under for another 20?
- Mm-hmm.

06:34.534 --> 06:39.062
Sergio, this is Dr. MacKee.
He's an expert in heart and lungs.

06:39.139 --> 06:45.942
And I'd like him to check you out.
There's nothing to be nervous about.

06:46.012 --> 06:49.345
Hi, Serge. How's it hanging?
I gotta tell ya, if you can hear me,

06:49.416 --> 06:52.977
I'd fire the anesthesiologist.

06:53.053 --> 06:55.521
Dr. MacKee likes to joke.

06:55.589 --> 07:00.390
Doesn't mean he's not caring,
that's just his way. He's a fine doctor.

07:03.463 --> 07:06.125
Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah.

07:06.199 --> 07:08.394
- Blumfield's amazing.
- Yeah. He published a paper:

07:08.468 --> 07:12.063
"Dialogue With Unconscious Patients".
Personally I keep it under my pillow.

07:12.139 --> 07:14.573
But this guy really believes
that they hear us.

07:14.640 --> 07:19.202
- I talk to you.
- But I pretend I'm conscious.

07:19.278 --> 07:21.576
- You eating?
- I don't know. I have some chores.

07:21.647 --> 07:23.615
What is it with this throat thing, huh?

07:23.682 --> 07:25.946
You know, Pete wants to do a bypass
on that short order cook.

07:26.018 --> 07:29.920
What's his name? Such a stupid name.
Heart the size of Pennsylvania.

07:29.989 --> 07:33.390
He's 65, he's 250 pounds, he had
a stroke, smokes two packs a day...

07:33.459 --> 07:34.551
Sounds in pretty good shape.

07:34.627 --> 07:37.619
So the guy crumps in six months
and it shows on our survival stats. Hi.

07:37.696 --> 07:39.926
Hi.

07:39.999 --> 07:41.694
- Hello, Doctor.
- Sarah.

07:47.606 --> 07:50.131
See you later.

07:50.209 --> 07:51.767
You hunk.

07:51.844 --> 07:54.438
- Ta-ta.
- Toodle-oo.

08:19.271 --> 08:20.898
Aaah.

08:20.973 --> 08:25.034
- How long have you had this throat?
- All my life.

08:26.011 --> 08:29.242
I don't know. A couple of... A little while.

08:29.315 --> 08:34.548
I can't really see anything.
A little swelling, some inflammation.

08:34.620 --> 08:39.922
Nothing to really worry about.
Are you steaming or what?

08:39.991 --> 08:41.789
What?

08:41.860 --> 08:43.691
- No, nothing.
- No, nothing.

08:43.761 --> 08:47.289
No wonder you still got a tickle.
What are you doing wasting my time?

08:47.366 --> 08:51.996
- I'm married to a doctor's wife.
- You too, huh?

08:52.071 --> 08:57.202
- Should I be referring you to someone?
- No.

08:57.276 --> 09:00.734
You're right. I should be steaming.

09:00.813 --> 09:04.044
I'll write you a note for some antibiotics.

09:04.116 --> 09:09.110
Better I should write to Anne,
prescribe TLC. How is she?

09:11.123 --> 09:13.114
She's terrific.

09:14.159 --> 09:18.027
I never see you guys
since your dad passed on.

09:22.167 --> 09:26.365
No, I-I kept clearing my throat,
it was like this habit thing.

09:28.073 --> 09:32.305
- Here, Jack.
- Thanks.

09:35.614 --> 09:41.280
- How's business in the big league?
- We're killing 'em.

09:46.425 --> 09:50.885
Hi. How're we doing?
I'm sorry I kept you waiting. Busy day.

09:50.963 --> 09:53.124
- Are we looking after you?
- Yes, thank you.

09:53.198 --> 09:55.462
Good.

09:55.534 --> 09:59.436
- Have you been sore?
- A little sore, yeah.

10:00.472 --> 10:02.406
OK.

10:03.375 --> 10:07.869
Oh, yeah. That's healed fine.
Let's just get those staples out.

10:08.747 --> 10:13.582
Doctor, my husband...

10:13.652 --> 10:20.023
He's a good man, and he...
I think he's a little nervous.

10:21.160 --> 10:23.628
Will the scar always be so...?

10:23.696 --> 10:26.665
Tell your husband you look
like a Playboy centerfold.

10:26.732 --> 10:29.462
You have the staple marks to prove it.

10:34.540 --> 10:39.603
No, no. No! No, no.

10:39.678 --> 10:43.876
I can smell tobacco from 50 paces.
I can smell it through the phone.

10:43.949 --> 10:46.611
You know how I quit?
I'll tell you the truth.

10:46.685 --> 10:48.516
I could kill for a cigarette
this very second.

10:48.587 --> 10:53.854
I'll give you back to my secretary. We'll
arrange to have you in for some tests.

10:53.926 --> 10:56.759
Carrie, take him back. Slap his wrist.

10:56.829 --> 11:02.426
He's not taking the cyclosporine
and he's smoking again.

11:03.569 --> 11:06.697
Whoa. Wait a minute.

11:06.772 --> 11:11.175
What? Pete? Just tell him I'll call back.

11:27.326 --> 11:29.191
My, my.

11:54.253 --> 11:57.814
Legs! Whoo!

12:02.059 --> 12:06.655
I wouldn't be caught dead with someone
stupid enough to drive that car.

12:06.731 --> 12:11.532
Too bad. You'll be missing
my electric roll-in-the-hay bar.

12:13.070 --> 12:15.231
Well, why didn't you say so?

12:17.008 --> 12:19.977
- Hi.
- Hi.

12:20.044 --> 12:21.375
- We have a dumpster.
- Mm-hmm.

12:21.446 --> 12:23.539
Do we have a contractor? No.

12:23.614 --> 12:26.742
- We do.
- This is a record. They've started.

12:26.818 --> 12:29.252
- Yeah, they started wrecking the place.
- Anne...

12:29.320 --> 12:31.117
- What?
- Anne...

12:31.189 --> 12:35.057
They'll have the old kitchen out and the
new one in, and you won't feel a thing.

12:35.126 --> 12:37.686
- And I know about pain. I'm a doctor.
- "I'm a doctor."

12:37.762 --> 12:42.165
- Is it OK about tonight?
- I'm a little nervous, but it'll be fine.

12:42.233 --> 12:44.064
- Why are you nervous?
- Gee, I don't know.

12:44.135 --> 12:46.831
I'm usually so comfortable
speaking in front of 200 people.

12:46.904 --> 12:48.235
You don't have to speak. I'll speak.

12:48.306 --> 12:51.070
You just stand by my side
and look gorgeous.

12:51.142 --> 12:54.873
No, I have to speak. Wait, wait. Are we
talking about the same thing here?

12:54.946 --> 12:57.938
Jack? The parents' meeting?

12:59.050 --> 13:01.382
- Oh, no. No, Jack.
- Hello?

13:01.452 --> 13:04.910
Don't tell me you forgot again.

13:04.989 --> 13:08.618
And then you wonder why the kids
call me "Miss" MacKee!

13:08.693 --> 13:13.824
- You're a total disaster.
- Well, I need you tonight as well.

13:16.200 --> 13:19.260
- Hey.
- I have to change.

13:22.206 --> 13:25.733
We can have dinner together
somewhere later.

13:25.810 --> 13:29.974
And you'll still forget next year,
won't you? Yeah.

13:45.329 --> 13:48.526
- Hola. Lucy. Como estas?
- Bad.

13:48.599 --> 13:50.590
OK.

13:51.636 --> 13:56.437
- Hey, kneepads and helmets.
- Why? We're staying in our yard.

13:56.507 --> 13:59.840
And what, you think
our concrete is softer?

13:59.911 --> 14:01.606
- Hi, Max.
- Hi, Dr. MacKee.

14:01.679 --> 14:04.307
- You, too.
- OK.

14:04.382 --> 14:06.247
- How was school?
- Pretty good.

14:06.317 --> 14:07.306
Good.

14:11.322 --> 14:13.517
If it leaks again, just...

14:25.469 --> 14:28.029
- Hi.
- Hi. How'd it go?

14:28.105 --> 14:31.973
Not bad. I only fainted once.
How was yours?

14:32.043 --> 14:35.570
I personally collected a check
for $50,000 towards a new wing

14:35.646 --> 14:38.376
from some guy who's big in glue.

14:39.517 --> 14:42.111
- Let's go spend it.
- Yeah.

14:44.989 --> 14:49.483
Well, what do you know? Oh, you're
not gonna answer it? Come on.

14:49.560 --> 14:51.528
- No.
- Jack.

14:51.596 --> 14:55.327
You're sounding tired again, you know.
You are. You're doing too much, honey.

14:55.399 --> 14:58.095
Let's just skip dinner and go home

14:58.169 --> 15:01.502
and I'll fix you something
while I still have a kitchen.

15:01.572 --> 15:03.563
OK.

15:08.646 --> 15:11.809
- Hello.
- Jack...

15:11.882 --> 15:16.819
Yes, OK. Yeah, OK, put her through.

15:20.825 --> 15:23.259
Mrs. Street, this is Dr. MacKee.

15:23.327 --> 15:25.295
<i>- Dr. MacKee?
- Yup.</i>

15:25.363 --> 15:28.332
<i>Well. You know what it is.
I'm lying here worrying.</i>

15:28.399 --> 15:30.162
Why would that be?

15:30.234 --> 15:32.498
<i>You took out my husband's lung
a month ago.</i>

15:32.570 --> 15:36.666
<i>Now he wants to mow the lawn.
Can he do that?</i>

15:36.741 --> 15:40.006
<i>- Well, it's pretty dark, but...
- Excuse me?</i>

15:40.077 --> 15:41.442
What's he saying?

15:41.512 --> 15:45.710
Does your husband have
a power mower, or does he push it?

15:45.783 --> 15:50.243
<i>Power mower? I don't know. Whatever
you say. He'll mow the lawn anyway.</i>

15:50.321 --> 15:53.313
<i>- That's the way he is.
- You know I got a damn power mower!</i>

15:53.391 --> 15:55.689
<i>- What?
- I got a power mower!</i>

15:55.760 --> 16:00.823
<i>He says it is a power mower. Hello?</i>

16:00.898 --> 16:06.336
I'm sure it'll be fine.
The exercise will do him good. OK?

16:06.404 --> 16:09.396
OK.

16:21.352 --> 16:26.346
- You OK?
- What? Yeah, I'm fine.

16:27.024 --> 16:32.724
What's that on your shirt?
Jack, is that blood?

16:37.101 --> 16:41.800
You know what? I must have burst
a blood vessel trying not to laugh.

16:41.872 --> 16:44.898
Jack, I have blood on my dress.

16:46.810 --> 16:51.144
My God, I have it in my hair, Jack.
What's going on?

16:51.214 --> 16:55.708
- Hey, relax.
- Relax? Has this happened before?

16:55.785 --> 16:58.686
I'm not bleeding to death here.

17:01.458 --> 17:05.861
<i>There's a danger in feeling
too strongly about your patients.</i>

17:06.096 --> 17:08.963
A danger in becoming too involved.

17:11.401 --> 17:15.734
Surgery is about judgment.
To judge, you have to be detached.

17:15.805 --> 17:18.933
But isn't it unnatural not to become
involved with a patient?

17:19.008 --> 17:22.375
There's nothing natural about surgery.
You're cutting open someone's body.

17:22.444 --> 17:26.244
Is that natural? One day you'll have
your hands around someone's heart.

17:26.316 --> 17:29.911
And it's beating. And you'll think,
"Uh-oh. I shouldn't be here."

17:29.986 --> 17:32.546
Well, then all the more reason
to care about what the patient feels.

17:32.622 --> 17:36.490
- The patient feels sick.
- A surgeon's job is to cut.

17:36.559 --> 17:41.258
You've got one shot.
You go in, you fix it and get out.

17:41.331 --> 17:42.320
- Fix it. Get out.
- Get out. Yeah.

17:42.398 --> 17:45.265
Caring's all about time.

17:45.335 --> 17:50.238
When you've got 30 seconds
before some guy bleeds out...

17:50.306 --> 17:53.207
I'd rather you cut straight
and cared less.

17:53.910 --> 17:59.177
Now, Harris here took a walk
from a fifth floor window.

18:00.083 --> 18:02.574
Should we come back?

18:05.455 --> 18:07.787
I'll be back.

18:08.224 --> 18:09.452
Here, Alan.

18:09.526 --> 18:13.895
"Transected aorta,
partially controlled by the pleura."

18:13.963 --> 18:16.693
- Procedure?
- Clamp above and below.

18:16.766 --> 18:19.894
You can suture the tear direct
or use a Dacron graft.

18:19.969 --> 18:21.766
What do we look for
when we go in, Jay-Jay?

18:21.838 --> 18:24.807
Apart from a great deal
of caring? Anyone?

18:24.874 --> 18:26.933
Significant continuing
blood loss and color.

18:27.010 --> 18:30.912
Yeah. How're we doing?

18:30.980 --> 18:36.111
I hadn't planned on ever waking up.
I feel stupid.

18:36.186 --> 18:39.087
You want my advice, Robert?
Next time you wanna give yourself

18:39.155 --> 18:47.255
some real punishment... try golf.
There's no greater torture.

18:50.066 --> 18:52.057
Thank you.

18:54.470 --> 18:57.496
I need you to take
as deep a breath as you can.

18:59.776 --> 19:02.074
If you were looking for a good ENT man,
who would you go to?

19:02.145 --> 19:03.976
- The Rabbi?
- Give me a break.

19:04.047 --> 19:05.742
Had the lowest mortality stats
in hospital.

19:05.815 --> 19:07.806
So would I if I took out tonsils.

19:07.884 --> 19:11.342
- Jack, my arrested lung's aphasic.
- You mean Richards? Shit.

19:11.421 --> 19:13.946
Obviously some damage from the
arrest. He must have had a stroke.

19:14.023 --> 19:16.821
Transfer him to Neurology.
No one dies in our service.

19:16.893 --> 19:21.330
I can't. I'm out. His wife fired me.
She's already phoned their lawyer...

19:21.397 --> 19:22.955
- How bad is he?
- Horrible.

19:23.032 --> 19:25.432
As of now, his speech is slurred,
he doesn't make any sense.

19:25.501 --> 19:28.026
So he moves to Texas.

19:28.104 --> 19:30.538
And you wonder why I'm so uptight
about our malpractice insurance.

19:30.607 --> 19:32.802
- It's never enough, you wait and see.
- Calm down.

19:32.876 --> 19:34.867
You did a responsible procedure.

19:34.944 --> 19:37.913
Sure. If you sneeze in this place,
they slap a lawsuit on you.

19:37.981 --> 19:40.882
Jack. There's your ENT man.

19:42.018 --> 19:44.077
Ooh!

19:46.923 --> 19:49.221
- Who is she?
- That's Leslie Abbott.

19:49.292 --> 19:54.252
- I think we're talking different talents.
- Absolutely not. She does great throat.

19:54.330 --> 19:57.356
- Puh-lease.
- I'm serious.

20:01.671 --> 20:04.435
- Is this for you, Jack?
- What?

20:04.507 --> 20:07.135
He's been doing
a little coughing for months.

20:07.210 --> 20:09.735
Well, if you won't see Leslie,
I'll check you out.

20:09.812 --> 20:12.838
- You're a gynecologist.
- So? Drop your pants.

20:17.353 --> 20:21.585
Hello. Sorry to keep you waiting.
Busy day.

20:21.658 --> 20:25.389
- Jack MacKee.
- Hmm? Yes, I know. Have a seat.

20:25.461 --> 20:27.452
Right.

20:31.334 --> 20:33.768
Murray Kaplan sends his best.

20:34.671 --> 20:37.538
Oh, that's right.
You're in practice together?

20:37.607 --> 20:40.132
Till we get it right.

20:44.747 --> 20:48.843
- So what seems to be the trouble?
- What?

20:51.321 --> 20:57.658
Nothing. I mean, I have... a tickle.
I've been hoarse.

20:57.727 --> 21:00.628
- Mm-hmm.
- So...

21:00.697 --> 21:02.790
All right. Let's take a look.

21:02.865 --> 21:06.733
Uncross your knees. Back in the chair.
Sit up. Hands on your knees.

21:06.803 --> 21:10.967
Chin forward. And open.

21:11.040 --> 21:14.032
Let's take a look. Close.

21:15.378 --> 21:18.313
Uh-huh. Open.

21:25.188 --> 21:27.179
Open.

21:47.909 --> 21:51.174
All right. Open.

21:51.246 --> 21:53.305
This might be a little bitter.

21:56.585 --> 22:01.613
- That's an anesthetic.
- I want to take a closer look.

22:01.990 --> 22:04.959
Whoa. A periscope!

22:06.595 --> 22:08.961
Won't be pleasant.

22:10.465 --> 22:12.456
Tongue out.

22:15.237 --> 22:21.073
All the way. And hold it... with your hand.

22:22.010 --> 22:26.447
Head forward. And open.

22:26.515 --> 22:30.042
- And "E".
- E-E-E.

22:32.654 --> 22:37.682
- Again.
- E-E-E-E...

22:37.759 --> 22:41.422
- Again.
- E-E-E-E...

22:41.496 --> 22:45.432
- Again.
- E-E-E-E...

22:45.500 --> 22:49.129
- One more time.
- E-E-E-E...

22:49.204 --> 22:51.934
And that's all I need.

23:02.584 --> 23:05.883
Doctor, you have a growth.

23:11.560 --> 23:13.892
What?

23:13.962 --> 23:18.023
A tumor. Laryngeal.
Here on the true vocal cord.

23:18.100 --> 23:21.365
I know what "laryngeal" is.

23:24.840 --> 23:28.776
We're gonna need chest X-rays,
blood chemistry,

23:28.844 --> 23:31.813
blood count, UA, EKG...

23:31.880 --> 23:34.144
I'll have to check with my secretary,
but if it's remotely possible,

23:34.216 --> 23:38.710
I'd like to do a biopsy tomorrow. OK?

23:44.926 --> 23:46.917
Thanks.

23:47.729 --> 23:49.788
Don't mention it.

24:02.878 --> 24:04.106
Hi.

24:06.815 --> 24:08.248
Hi.

24:10.919 --> 24:14.753
You OK? I thought you had
a bypass tonight.

24:14.823 --> 24:18.554
His EKG wasn't so good.
We postponed.

24:18.627 --> 24:20.788
I'm fine.

24:24.199 --> 24:27.600
So great! So we have
an evening together.

24:27.669 --> 24:29.660
Yeah.

24:30.438 --> 24:34.875
- Yeah. I'll call Nicky. Nicky!
- Coming!

24:34.943 --> 24:37.605
- Say hi to your Dad!
- Oh, OK.

24:39.514 --> 24:44.975
Hi, Dad. Dad?
Mom, we got disconnected.

24:45.053 --> 24:49.786
- Oh! Hi, Dad!
- Special live appearance.

24:50.592 --> 24:53.755
- How're you doing?
- Pretty good.

24:53.828 --> 24:56.695
Your dad's home tonight.

25:41.543 --> 25:44.273
- What are you doing?
- Hi!

25:44.346 --> 25:46.337
Hi.

25:55.123 --> 25:57.250
So, tell me.

25:58.293 --> 26:00.693
There's nothing to tell.

26:00.762 --> 26:04.425
You know, the longer you don't tell me,
the more frightened I'm getting.

26:04.499 --> 26:07.161
Anne...

26:07.235 --> 26:11.399
What is it, Jack? What have they found?

26:11.473 --> 26:15.773
Huh? Have they found something?

26:17.177 --> 26:19.168
Yep!

26:27.554 --> 26:32.787
OK, so... we'll beat it.

26:33.727 --> 26:35.354
- "We"?
- Mm-hmm.

26:35.429 --> 26:42.562
'We" don't have it, Anne!

26:42.903 --> 26:45.736
"We" don't have it!

26:45.806 --> 26:50.266
It's not a team game.

26:51.812 --> 26:53.803
OK.

26:56.750 --> 26:59.480
Why don't you come to bed?

27:44.365 --> 27:48.233
I have a biopsy tomorrow.
It's a laryngeal tumor.

27:48.302 --> 27:50.293
Oh, God.

27:56.377 --> 28:01.314
A doctor tells this man,
"You have a growth."

28:01.382 --> 28:05.682
Man says, "I demand a second opinion."

28:05.753 --> 28:12.181
Doctor says, "OK... and... you're ugly."

28:17.831 --> 28:20.459
Oh, sweetheart.

28:26.140 --> 28:29.166
Oh, baby...

28:34.782 --> 28:38.513
What am I doing sitting here
like one of the herd?

28:46.160 --> 28:48.890
- Name?
- Dr. MacKee.

28:48.962 --> 28:50.987
- First name?
- Jack.

28:51.064 --> 28:56.127
I've been an attending surgeon
on the staff of this hospital for 11 years.

28:59.106 --> 29:02.598
Then you should know
all about filling in forms.

29:02.676 --> 29:04.166
We've been sitting here for 30 minutes.

29:04.244 --> 29:07.509
Why didn't she give us these
when we first arrived?

29:08.415 --> 29:11.543
She should have.

29:17.191 --> 29:19.785
MacKee!

29:19.860 --> 29:22.385
- MacKee!
- Yeah.

29:23.697 --> 29:26.257
- Go home, Anne.
- No, I'll wait.

29:26.333 --> 29:27.891
- Really, it's no big deal.
- But I want to...

29:27.968 --> 29:31.199
I'll call when I can manage a croak.

29:32.339 --> 29:34.330
OK.

29:36.844 --> 29:39.608
MacKee.

29:39.680 --> 29:44.117
- I don't need a wheelchair.
- You have to sit in the chair.

29:44.184 --> 29:48.985
Listen. I know you. I'm Dr. MacKee.

29:49.056 --> 29:52.822
I don't need a chair.
I'm perfectly capable of walking.

29:52.893 --> 29:58.297
Please sit in the chair, Doctor.
If you fall over, the hospital is liable.

29:59.967 --> 30:03.300
I don't fall over in hospitals.

30:18.852 --> 30:20.945
<i>I know that Dr. Abbott
has been a little delayed.</i>

30:21.021 --> 30:23.922
But we'd like you to undress, please.

30:23.991 --> 30:27.518
Put on the gown you'll find on the bed.
They'll be down for you shortly.

30:27.594 --> 30:30.757
There's been a mistake.
This isn't a private room.

30:30.831 --> 30:34.790
Yes, I'm afraid we don't have
any private rooms just at the moment.

30:34.868 --> 30:40.932
- I'm not about to share a room.
- We don't have any private rooms.

30:41.008 --> 30:44.876
I understand Dr. Abbott felt
this biopsy was urgent.

31:00.761 --> 31:02.752
Hey!

31:04.297 --> 31:07.926
- Hey.
- Don't let her rattle you.

31:08.000 --> 31:10.560
They want your bare butt hanging out

31:10.636 --> 31:14.367
just so you don't get up
and bother them.

31:21.280 --> 31:25.546
I'm Ralph. My bowels are all
screwed up. What are you in for?

31:28.454 --> 31:31.082
Jack MacKee. Throat.

31:31.157 --> 31:33.955
What, your tongue,
your voice box, your tonsils?

31:34.026 --> 31:36.324
There's a lot of software in there.

31:36.395 --> 31:41.355
- Voice box.
- Oh, you poor bastard.

31:43.502 --> 31:46.869
Your first time under the knife?

31:46.939 --> 31:50.898
I bet you feel like you don't know
what's going on? Am I right?

31:50.977 --> 31:53.571
Well, don't worry.
They don't know, either.

31:53.646 --> 31:59.175
My doctor, the son of a bitch,
half the time he's lying to me.

31:59.251 --> 32:03.415
And I can tell. I'm a cop.

32:05.424 --> 32:07.392
What's your line?

32:11.297 --> 32:13.663
I'm a doctor.

32:15.768 --> 32:18.293
They're gonna cut you, doc?

32:19.605 --> 32:22.301
Yeah.

32:26.312 --> 32:32.410
Hey, Jack. How's it hanging?
Don't tell me, I can see for myself.

32:33.285 --> 32:37.312
Hi. What's going on here?

32:37.390 --> 32:40.621
The Ritz was full.

32:40.693 --> 32:44.561
- What time are they doing you?
- When Madame shows up.

32:44.630 --> 32:46.928
I spoke to her lawyer. He's very bullish.

32:46.999 --> 32:50.332
He says you're the expert, so we need
you on the witness stand, OK?

32:50.403 --> 32:53.236
- Don't go shuffling off to Buffalo just yet.
- But after that...

32:53.305 --> 32:56.741
Sure, after that, do what you like.
I couldn't care less.

33:00.246 --> 33:04.376
You OK?
You want me to go in with you?

33:05.051 --> 33:08.487
I want you to go in instead of me.

33:18.597 --> 33:21.998
- I did your bypass. Very clean.
- Great.

33:22.068 --> 33:25.469
- I even played your closing music.
- Did Nancy sing?

33:27.940 --> 33:33.037
- No, Nancy did not sing.
- That's good.

33:34.747 --> 33:38.080
Yeah, it's this one.

33:39.285 --> 33:41.150
She's never
gonna come back 100%.

33:41.220 --> 33:43.279
I know.

33:43.355 --> 33:45.346
Do you suppose you could get me
a thinner sheet?

33:45.424 --> 33:48.882
I'm not sure everyone
can see through this one.

33:54.366 --> 33:56.129
It must be some sort of a shunt.

33:56.202 --> 33:57.726
What do you think
of those blood gasses?

33:57.803 --> 33:59.668
- She's hypoxic.
- I know.

33:59.739 --> 34:02.435
But I saw the chest today
and the atelectasis is almost gone.

34:02.508 --> 34:03.634
There's something else going on.

34:03.709 --> 34:08.373
Does she have a murmur? You could be
dealing with an Eisenmenger Syndrome.

34:08.447 --> 34:11.746
Yes, it talks! Amazing!

34:15.154 --> 34:17.088
I have the radiographic video.
You wanna take a look at it?

34:17.156 --> 34:19.420
- Yeah.
- Who's the internist?

34:19.492 --> 34:20.891
Oh, hey, hey, Barry,
I've been looking for you.

34:20.960 --> 34:25.590
- So?
- I was late. It was very late.

34:27.399 --> 34:30.527
Good morning.
Everything all right there?

34:32.571 --> 34:36.803
- Now you're gonna feel a little prick.
- Please, Doctor, we've only just met.

34:47.553 --> 34:50.283
Looks like a sweet dream.

34:51.322 --> 34:54.850
Huh? Now, just keep dreaming.
Don't wake up.

34:54.927 --> 34:58.454
There's no need for you
to wake up, OK? Keep dreaming.

34:58.531 --> 35:01.329
We're just gonna roll you over
on your side. Come on.

35:01.400 --> 35:04.426
Help me out. Help me out. Help me out.

35:04.503 --> 35:08.496
Nice. You just stay there for me.

35:15.281 --> 35:20.412
Hey! Mr. Brown, relax.
Mr. Brown, relax, man.

35:20.486 --> 35:24.946
Hey, hey! Just relax, don't strain.
Keep dreaming.

35:25.024 --> 35:29.051
Mr. Brown, you know you're scheduled
for a barium enema.

35:29.128 --> 35:33.292
Relax. It's just an enema! Now breathe.

35:33.966 --> 35:36.901
Just tell Mr. Jaconelli
Dr. MacKee's wife called

35:36.969 --> 35:40.302
and that I expect him to get back
to me personally about this, OK?

35:40.372 --> 35:42.636
Right. Thank you.

35:45.644 --> 35:48.613
I'm Leslie Abbott.

35:48.680 --> 35:53.413
Jack? Jack, honey. Dr. Abbott's here.

35:57.922 --> 35:59.446
Hi.

36:00.358 --> 36:02.758
I'm sorry. I understand
there was some confusion

36:02.827 --> 36:04.260
regarding beds and procedures.

36:04.329 --> 36:06.194
Yeah.

36:06.264 --> 36:11.201
I hope you biopsied my throat
and not my colon.

36:11.269 --> 36:12.497
I'm sorry.

36:13.838 --> 36:18.673
So, did Path throw the I Ching?

36:19.911 --> 36:22.675
The tumor is malignant.

36:37.595 --> 36:40.325
The tumor is malignant.

36:44.636 --> 36:49.505
It's a T-2 lesion.
You're welcome to a second opinion.

36:49.574 --> 36:52.270
No. One enema's enough for any tumor.

36:52.343 --> 36:55.710
- How will you treat it?
- I'm recommending radiation therapy.

36:55.780 --> 36:58.874
I want it cut out.

36:58.950 --> 37:01.817
Radiation will reduce the mass
for this kind of tumor,

37:01.886 --> 37:04.616
and we got a high cure rate.
80% or better.

37:04.689 --> 37:07.089
And if I have to cut,
I risk losing the voice.

37:17.001 --> 37:22.405
- Do you know a good radiation man?
- Clark Kent.

37:25.710 --> 37:28.008
Charlie Reed is terrific.

37:28.079 --> 37:30.309
You could meet with him, get an MR

37:30.381 --> 37:33.248
and they could start fitting you
for treatment as of tomorrow.

37:33.318 --> 37:35.684
What time tomorrow?

37:35.753 --> 37:40.247
I have open heart scheduled
for tomorrow.

37:42.527 --> 37:46.327
Dr. MacKee... you've got cancer.

37:47.999 --> 37:50.934
Tomorrow's great. Thanks.

37:51.002 --> 37:53.664
I've signed you out. I think you're gonna
be more comfortable in your own bed.

37:53.738 --> 37:59.677
And you shouldn't be talking.
OK, we'll see you later.

38:12.991 --> 38:15.892
- I can do it.
- OK.

38:15.960 --> 38:19.259
Honey, listen, just...

38:20.732 --> 38:22.791
bring the car around, OK?

38:22.867 --> 38:24.858
OK.

38:44.655 --> 38:46.646
Dr. MacKee?

38:51.362 --> 38:56.390
I just heard. Did they get
the biopsy results back yet?

38:57.535 --> 39:01.164
Yeah. It's positive.

39:03.741 --> 39:06.608
How'd you hear?
Did they post it in the men's room?

39:06.677 --> 39:09.544
No.

39:13.351 --> 39:15.649
Come on, I'll walk down with you.

39:18.890 --> 39:22.189
I'm fine, thank you. I'll be just fine.

39:29.067 --> 39:31.763
I feel like having a cigarette.

39:33.271 --> 39:38.106
I have a tumor, my throat feels
like shit, and I want a cigarette.

39:38.643 --> 39:40.634
Yeah.

39:44.015 --> 39:45.539
We should have come
in the red lobster.

39:45.616 --> 39:48.176
This car always makes you depressed.

39:53.591 --> 39:58.961
We're laughing. They cut my throat
and we're laughing. Can you believe it?

40:10.508 --> 40:13.944
I couldn't bear it if...

40:30.228 --> 40:33.994
Better.

40:34.064 --> 40:36.624
Not better.

40:36.700 --> 40:40.568
We'll strip it down
on the weekend. Nicky?

40:41.638 --> 40:45.665
- Max is waiting.
- Yeah.

40:45.742 --> 40:49.075
Your mother told you
I had a test yesterday?

40:50.413 --> 40:51.641
Yeah.

40:51.715 --> 40:55.310
Well, it turns out I've got a growth,

40:55.385 --> 41:00.015
a lesion in my throat which is...

41:01.358 --> 41:03.189
not great.

41:05.595 --> 41:08.792
But it's the kind of tumor
which responds well to radiation,

41:08.865 --> 41:11.493
which is great. Which is...

41:12.969 --> 41:17.463
It... it's pretty great.

41:22.412 --> 41:26.314
- Dad, I gotta go.
- OK.

42:39.289 --> 42:43.350
This MRI examination
takes about 40 minutes.

42:43.426 --> 42:48.022
And it's very important that you don't
move at all during that time.

42:49.699 --> 42:54.261
- Are you claustrophobic?
- Only in cramped spaces.

43:05.181 --> 43:09.015
I just filled in all these forms.
I don't get this.

43:09.085 --> 43:11.952
Why don't you get this stuff from
Radiology? It's 50 feet down the hall.

43:12.022 --> 43:14.718
I know. I'm sorry.
It's the same for everybody.

43:14.791 --> 43:17.885
- We have to have our own records.
- Yeah, but...

43:17.961 --> 43:19.292
- Hi.
- Great hat.

43:19.362 --> 43:21.125
- Thanks.
- Hello. Radiation Therapy,

43:21.197 --> 43:24.758
Laurie speaking. No. Yes.

43:25.802 --> 43:28.396
Yes.

43:28.471 --> 43:33.101
Wait till you see the disclaimer
forms. They deliver them in a truck.

43:34.077 --> 43:36.637
- Uh-huh. Let me have a look.
- Um...

43:36.713 --> 43:38.840
I'll be right with you.

43:38.915 --> 43:42.248
Let me call you back once I've located it.

43:42.319 --> 43:46.688
Well, you know, busy. Yeah.
What seems to be the problem?

43:46.756 --> 43:48.451
I don't wanna pull rank,
but I don't know if you realize

43:48.525 --> 43:50.322
I'm an attending surgeon at this hospital.

43:50.393 --> 43:53.157
I knew that, Doctor, yes.

43:53.229 --> 43:56.858
OK, good. So you'll appreciate
when I say I have patients of my own

43:56.933 --> 43:58.525
who are waiting for me
while I'm waiting for you,

43:58.601 --> 44:00.501
which is why I mention
I'm not looking for VIP...

44:00.570 --> 44:03.232
You know, the pity is
you were late getting here, so...

44:03.306 --> 44:06.207
Hang on! I was not late getting here.
Radiology was late with my MRI.

44:06.276 --> 44:08.267
I was not...

44:09.412 --> 44:13.712
Please don't
make me strain my voice.

44:13.783 --> 44:16.343
- Dr. MacKee?
- Yeah.

44:16.419 --> 44:18.512
I'm Charles Reed.

44:18.588 --> 44:20.954
- Oh.
- Come in.

44:31.801 --> 44:35.760
- How we doing?
- Super.

44:35.839 --> 44:38.330
Sit down.

44:38.408 --> 44:40.740
No, I've been sitting.

44:40.810 --> 44:44.507
Dr. MacKee, my feeling - for what it's
worth - if we're going to treat you,

44:44.581 --> 44:49.041
you're going to meet the team here
every day for the next six weeks.

44:49.119 --> 44:50.108
And?

44:50.186 --> 44:52.177
I don't know what it's like
at the top of this building,

44:52.255 --> 44:54.723
but down here, we try to be civil.

44:54.791 --> 44:56.452
Oh, well, upstairs we're very hostile.

44:56.526 --> 45:00.826
We meet our patients, we come
right out and tell them our feelings...

45:00.897 --> 45:03.263
for what they're worth.

45:03.333 --> 45:04.561
OK.

45:04.634 --> 45:09.799
So... we're not gonna fall in love.
What else do I need to know?

45:09.873 --> 45:12.740
Your chest is clear.

45:12.809 --> 45:14.800
We'll get the MRI from tomorrow
and get started

45:14.878 --> 45:17.312
assuming there's no spread
to the lymph nodes.

45:17.380 --> 45:20.747
And the rest of this visit,
we'll fit you up for treatment.

45:20.816 --> 45:23.148
Good.

45:23.218 --> 45:26.187
And if the lymph nodes show positive?

45:26.255 --> 45:30.055
I'll discuss a different treatment
with Dr. Abbott.

45:31.360 --> 45:33.624
And me.

45:35.564 --> 45:38.055
Yeah, sure.

45:45.340 --> 45:47.365
Watch your step. Through here.

45:47.443 --> 45:52.346
If we can just have you come around
on this side... and hop up on here

45:52.414 --> 45:55.577
and lie so your head faces that way.

45:55.651 --> 45:57.642
Careful.

46:00.022 --> 46:03.719
Your last guest stole the bed linen.

46:13.769 --> 46:15.669
Here, we're gonna put
your wrists in the straps.

46:15.737 --> 46:19.833
When I ask you to,
I want you to pull up really hard. OK?

46:21.643 --> 46:25.101
Head down. OK, and pull.

46:35.591 --> 46:38.651
- What are you doing?
- Just marking the target.

46:38.727 --> 46:43.596
- OK. This mark'll come off.
- Hey, it's nothing to worry about.

46:43.665 --> 46:47.465
We just need to take a film and make
sure we're hitting the right spot.

46:54.276 --> 46:56.744
- What are you doing?
- We're just making a mask of your head

46:56.812 --> 47:00.578
in this position, all right? It's real fast.

47:03.519 --> 47:05.510
All right.

47:19.368 --> 47:21.336
...for an hour already.
- I understand. I'm sorry.

47:21.403 --> 47:24.304
- Great. Finally! Dr. Taylor...
- I know, I know.

47:24.373 --> 47:27.308
- Just give me five minutes.
- Doctor...

47:27.376 --> 47:30.743
Hello, Mrs. Arcari.
We'll be right with you.

47:35.751 --> 47:37.150
Oh, man.

47:39.988 --> 47:43.822
- Hey, partner.
- Hi.

47:44.459 --> 47:47.622
God, Jack, you look like shit.
Is this the radiation?

47:47.696 --> 47:52.360
- No, this is nearly the radiation.
- What are you doing here?

47:52.434 --> 47:56.165
I have a room full of patients.

47:57.940 --> 47:59.908
What about the valve job later?
What's his name?

47:59.975 --> 48:02.307
Choy. That'll be fine.

48:02.377 --> 48:04.607
I wouldn't want you
cutting my heart today.

48:04.680 --> 48:07.342
I told you, I'll be fine.

48:09.184 --> 48:11.379
Jack, we had a talk this morning.
Nobody planned...

48:11.453 --> 48:15.048
- "We"? Who's "we"?
- Pete, Ed, me. The practice.

48:15.123 --> 48:19.992
No. Pete, Ed, you and me
is the practice!

48:20.062 --> 48:23.498
Gosh, wherever I go these days,
I'm getting cut out of the talk.

48:23.565 --> 48:27.262
- What?
- So...

48:30.439 --> 48:32.771
What did "we" talk about?

48:34.109 --> 48:36.805
Jack, you're sick. Stay home.

48:36.878 --> 48:40.507
Stay home a week, two weeks,
three weeks, whatever it takes.

48:40.582 --> 48:43.380
- I don't want to stay home.
- Annie called me. She's worried as hell.

48:43.452 --> 48:46.910
- I don't wanna stay home!
- OK.

48:47.723 --> 48:51.318
What we don't want to happen, buddy...

48:51.393 --> 48:54.885
is to start canceling surgery time,
missing appointments,

48:54.963 --> 48:57.261
losing ground on the stats, that's all.

48:57.332 --> 49:01.200
From tomorrow,
I have 15 minutes' treatment a day.

49:01.269 --> 49:03.362
- Sure, Jack.
- 15 minutes in six weeks,

49:03.438 --> 49:06.737
that's it, it's gone.
So let's go back to work.

49:06.808 --> 49:09.470
And can everybody wipe that caring look
off their face! Is that possible?

49:09.544 --> 49:12.104
Because it's a royal pain!

49:21.857 --> 49:24.519
Come on, Carrie, let's go.

49:37.706 --> 49:41.699
- Ow! Ow! What are you doing?
- I'm just giving you a tiny tattoo.

49:41.777 --> 49:43.108
What? You're what?

49:43.178 --> 49:45.976
Nice and still now.
These are gonna be permanent marks.

49:47.949 --> 49:49.974
Shouldn't there be a lead apron?

49:50.052 --> 49:54.284
Oh, no. The beam is focused
on your larynx, doc. You don't need it.

49:55.824 --> 49:58.019
But can we have the apron
anyway though, please?

49:58.093 --> 50:03.030
Really, you don't need it, doc.
But, don't move.

50:26.787 --> 50:30.188
- I don't wanna wear kneepads.
- You've got to wear 'em.

50:31.659 --> 50:36.926
- Anybody need a doctor?
- Yes.

50:40.534 --> 50:43.094
It's an abrasion. Leave it open.

50:48.509 --> 50:50.670
- Good day?
- Great.

50:50.745 --> 50:54.738
I thought to myself, "What the hell?"
I went out and I got drunk,

50:54.815 --> 50:57.978
and decided to have myself tattooed.

50:58.052 --> 51:00.486
What do you think?

51:00.554 --> 51:03.955
That's where they shoot the X-rays.

51:07.361 --> 51:09.386
Dr. Reed's not here yet?

51:12.767 --> 51:14.758
Oh.

51:17.371 --> 51:22.434
- Um...
- Oh, thank you so much.

51:22.510 --> 51:25.343
I'm not doing so well today.

51:25.880 --> 51:27.848
Hi.

51:27.915 --> 51:33.182
Sit down. I'm leaving anyway.
Thank you.

51:33.254 --> 51:37.657
Oh, Dr. MacKee. I'm sorry.
Dr. Reed can't be here this morning.

51:37.725 --> 51:40.751
No. No. Why not?

51:40.828 --> 51:44.093
He's been held up. I think there's
some admin meeting all day today.

51:44.165 --> 51:46.292
- When do I see him?
- He'll be here next week.

51:46.367 --> 51:49.928
No, look it, if I can't see him today,
I'll see him tomorrow!

51:50.004 --> 51:51.733
- We're closed weekends.
- Laurie?

51:51.806 --> 51:53.000
I'll be right there, Carol.

51:53.073 --> 51:55.598
I was told this was
to be a daily treatment.

51:55.676 --> 51:58.406
Well, I'm sorry. I don't make the rules.
I'm sure that...

51:58.479 --> 52:00.879
Why don't we from now on,
in this hospital,

52:00.948 --> 52:04.748
we should drop "I'm sorry"
from conversation, OK?

52:04.819 --> 52:07.652
Let's just assume
it begins every sentence.

52:07.721 --> 52:09.882
"I'm sorry, the doctor
can't see you today",

52:09.957 --> 52:11.822
"I'm sorry you have
to fill in another form",

52:11.892 --> 52:15.589
"I'm sorry we gave you
the wrong treatment."

52:15.663 --> 52:18.427
What do we think?

52:27.408 --> 52:30.775
There's not much point
shouting at Laurie.

52:33.447 --> 52:36.939
- Excuse me?
- She's just doing her job.

52:37.017 --> 52:39.247
If you want to shout,
go shout at a doctor.

52:39.320 --> 52:43.381
- I am a doctor.
- Not when you're sitting here.

52:44.525 --> 52:47.824
- How come you're so calm?
- Who?

52:47.895 --> 52:50.193
You. You seem to be taking it so well.

52:52.433 --> 52:56.927
No. I have a grade four brain tumor.

52:57.004 --> 53:02.909
It took my doctors three months to
find it. I didn't take that so well at all.

53:07.314 --> 53:09.214
Actually, they didn't find it.

53:09.283 --> 53:14.687
I rear-ended a few cars,
fell over, blacked out.

53:14.755 --> 53:17.553
Short of the tumor
jumping out and singing,

53:17.625 --> 53:20.560
there was nothing else it could do
to get recognized.

53:20.628 --> 53:24.394
See, now I'd call that negligence,
wouldn't you?

53:24.465 --> 53:28.868
Well, that's-that's...
it's difficult to comment.

53:29.837 --> 53:34.797
Oh, yeah. It's a club, isn't it? I forgot.

53:38.345 --> 53:43.078
- Did you get tests?
- Sure.

53:43.717 --> 53:49.417
- What?
- CAT scan... two.

53:49.490 --> 53:51.583
Of course that was way down the track,

53:51.659 --> 53:55.459
after they gave me aspirin
and sent me home.

53:55.529 --> 54:00.990
Oh, and then what?
There was stress management.

54:01.068 --> 54:05.698
Yeah. Oh, and then traffic school.
That was really helpful.

54:10.611 --> 54:15.571
My father had a patient.
Same diagnosis, grade four.

54:15.649 --> 54:18.243
He has grandchildren now.

54:20.087 --> 54:24.114
- Are you serious?
- Sure.

54:25.559 --> 54:31.054
- June. Let's do it.
- That's me. June.

54:33.300 --> 54:35.962
See you later, June.

54:36.036 --> 54:38.903
You look good today, June.

54:45.112 --> 54:46.977
- I'll check it.
- Thanks, Walter.

54:47.047 --> 54:49.345
- Anytime.
- Murray, do me a favor, will ya?

54:49.415 --> 54:53.977
Call Radiology and ask them
for the results of my MRI.

54:54.053 --> 54:57.887
- Doesn't Leslie have them?
- I can't get her. I can't get Reed.

54:57.957 --> 55:00.551
And I can't wait any longer.

55:00.626 --> 55:01.991
They ought to release them
to you straight off.

55:02.061 --> 55:06.691
I mean, I don't know what you think
I'm going to accomplish.

55:06.766 --> 55:09.098
Hi. Who's this?

55:09.168 --> 55:12.626
Hey, Joanne, Murray Kaplan.
How you doing?

55:12.705 --> 55:17.574
Good. Listen, do me a favor, Joanne.
Pull me an MR file, would you?

55:17.643 --> 55:22.444
Jack MacKee. Capital "M", capital "K".

55:22.515 --> 55:27.179
No. No, it's Leslie Abbott's.

55:27.253 --> 55:32.156
No, I know that, Joanne. Sure...

55:32.225 --> 55:36.992
Hello, this is Dr. MacKee
and this is my file.

55:38.031 --> 55:42.764
No, it's not my patient.
It's in my name. I'm the patient.

55:44.103 --> 55:46.367
No, you do not need
to clear it with anybody.

55:46.439 --> 55:48.168
You just go now, open the file

55:48.241 --> 55:51.608
and tell me if it shows any spread
to the lymph nodes.

55:51.677 --> 55:53.668
Thank you.

55:55.214 --> 55:56.806
Dr. MacKee. We're ready in one.

55:56.883 --> 55:59.044
We'll be right with you.

56:05.191 --> 56:08.854
Thank you. Thank you, I appreciate that.

56:11.364 --> 56:15.300
- Zero spread.
- Oh, thank God! Oh, God!

56:20.506 --> 56:24.033
Dr. Blumfield...

56:24.110 --> 56:29.844
This is the ghost
of a thousand murdered tonsils.

56:29.916 --> 56:31.941
Put us back...

56:32.018 --> 56:38.821
Dr. Eli! This is your
tongue depressor - lick me!

57:05.852 --> 57:08.821
Hi.

57:10.256 --> 57:12.247
Anne!

57:14.160 --> 57:16.560
Anne!

57:16.629 --> 57:18.620
Nick!

57:42.288 --> 57:46.452
Well, hello. Chicken or sausage?

57:46.526 --> 57:51.964
Uh, hi. What are you doing out here?

57:52.031 --> 57:57.094
I'm celebrating. No spread
to the lymph nodes. They're clear.

57:58.137 --> 58:00.765
- What?
- Yeah.

58:00.840 --> 58:06.437
Oh, my God, that's wonderful.
That's, um...

58:07.413 --> 58:11.406
- Oh, thank God!
- Yeah, I thought so.

58:11.484 --> 58:14.044
So join the party.
Have a piece of sausage.

58:14.120 --> 58:18.420
Oh, no, no. I'm... I've eaten.

58:19.926 --> 58:21.917
OK.

58:22.695 --> 58:26.096
- Where's Nicky?
- He's sleeping over with Max.

58:26.165 --> 58:29.532
Great. Doesn't this smell great?

58:29.602 --> 58:32.036
Jack, are you angry about something?

58:32.104 --> 58:34.971
You know, I always work late
on Friday nights.

58:35.041 --> 58:40.240
- Sure. Do these look burnt?
- I mean, if I'd known...

58:40.947 --> 58:43.245
But, I didn't even know
you were expecting this news.

58:43.316 --> 58:46.444
Why didn't you tell me?

58:46.519 --> 58:49.420
You should've called me. I would have...

58:51.023 --> 58:54.891
Let's go inside.

58:56.262 --> 59:00.198
- Aren't you cold?
- Yeah, you are cold.

59:06.839 --> 59:09.364
Will you just tell me
how you want me to be, Jack?

59:09.442 --> 59:12.502
OK? Because I never know these days.

59:12.578 --> 59:16.912
Really. Like, like, like, what are we now?
Are we happy, are we not happy?

59:16.983 --> 59:22.182
Are we close, not close?
Please just tell me, I'll be there.

59:32.194 --> 59:35.254
Well, this is quality time.

59:36.030 --> 59:40.126
Why couldn't they send us the new IDs
through the mail? Do we know?

59:40.802 --> 59:45.034
Tell them you're a big doctor. Cut in line.

59:47.842 --> 59:50.902
Are you angry with me?

59:50.979 --> 59:53.880
You lied to me.

59:55.650 --> 59:57.845
What?

59:57.919 --> 01:00:02.947
My tumor. I see it giving me
certain freedoms I never allowed myself.

01:00:03.691 --> 01:00:06.592
Yeah, like being incredibly hostile.

01:00:07.528 --> 01:00:12.056
Like being honest and expecting
people around me to do the same.

01:00:12.133 --> 01:00:15.591
What did I lie about for Christ's sake?

01:00:15.670 --> 01:00:20.607
I'm dying. Please don't waste my time.

01:00:23.311 --> 01:00:26.439
- Miss Ellis.
- Thank you.

01:00:26.514 --> 01:00:28.505
Your card.

01:00:31.486 --> 01:00:36.446
They should've found your tumor.
You were right. Somebody screwed up.

01:00:37.191 --> 01:00:39.853
You should've had an MRI.

01:00:43.665 --> 01:00:45.758
But the system stinks.

01:00:45.833 --> 01:00:50.497
Insurance companies tell us
what tests we can and cannot do.

01:00:50.571 --> 01:00:55.702
An MRI, which I know
would have found your tumor...

01:00:57.545 --> 01:01:01.538
costs about $1,000.

01:01:17.799 --> 01:01:20.893
It's appalling.

01:01:21.936 --> 01:01:25.497
And what about your father's patient?

01:01:30.678 --> 01:01:33.408
The one who recovered?

01:01:40.788 --> 01:01:43.052
There was no patient.

01:01:51.232 --> 01:01:53.223
OK.

01:01:59.674 --> 01:02:02.165
Just don't lie to me again.

01:02:05.179 --> 01:02:07.170
OK.

01:02:08.783 --> 01:02:12.275
One, two, three, four. One...

01:02:14.455 --> 01:02:16.980
You wanna try? Show him how to do it.

01:02:17.058 --> 01:02:19.891
- Pretty amazing.
- I'm not that bad.

01:02:19.961 --> 01:02:21.952
I got a date.

01:02:23.064 --> 01:02:26.363
- Great.
- No, I wish.

01:02:26.434 --> 01:02:30.097
In court. So we got to get
our stories straight.

01:02:30.171 --> 01:02:32.605
What stories? Alan, who's first?

01:02:32.673 --> 01:02:38.236
- The terminal in 1217.
- Terminal?

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:41.713
What terminal? Bus terminal?

01:02:41.783 --> 01:02:47.244
No... the dying patient in 1217.

01:02:47.321 --> 01:02:50.256
What's the patient's name?

01:02:51.492 --> 01:02:54.586
- Jay-Jay?
- Mr. Winter.

01:02:54.662 --> 01:02:59.156
OK, now Mr. Winter
is either alive or dead.

01:02:59.233 --> 01:03:05.001
So, is Mr. Winter alive,
or should we advise the morgue?

01:03:06.674 --> 01:03:11.407
Call another patient "terminal" and that's
how you'll describe your career!

01:03:17.385 --> 01:03:20.149
What room is he in?

01:04:12.306 --> 01:04:14.570
Barbara died.

01:04:16.611 --> 01:04:19.876
The older woman with the knitting.

01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:23.415
She didn't wake up this morning.

01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:55.109
- What are you thinking?
- I don't know.

01:04:57.484 --> 01:05:01.511
That Barbara had been knitting
that big shawl for her granddaughter

01:05:01.588 --> 01:05:06.992
for months... and she finished it.

01:05:09.963 --> 01:05:15.765
And I've never been to London...

01:05:15.835 --> 01:05:18.804
or Italy.

01:05:21.841 --> 01:05:25.106
I never had a baby.

01:05:27.213 --> 01:05:30.774
I never learned to use chopsticks.

01:05:31.585 --> 01:05:36.022
And I had a front-row ticket

01:05:36.089 --> 01:05:41.652
to see the American Indian Dance
Theater. They were touring here.

01:05:41.728 --> 01:05:43.127
God, I've always wanted to see them.

01:05:43.196 --> 01:05:46.859
You know, they have
these great costumes.

01:05:49.336 --> 01:05:52.305
And I was in this place.

01:05:53.673 --> 01:05:55.664
So...

01:05:57.477 --> 01:06:01.436
It's just one more thing to add to my list.

01:06:02.415 --> 01:06:04.781
They'll be back.

01:06:05.619 --> 01:06:08.144
In six months.

01:07:05.311 --> 01:07:08.940
Mr. Maris, any questions?

01:07:09.015 --> 01:07:13.748
You know, Doctor... it seems strange.

01:07:15.355 --> 01:07:19.689
There's somebody out there
alive, walking around...

01:07:21.628 --> 01:07:24.859
Then something terrible will happen,
and they'll die.

01:07:30.737 --> 01:07:35.265
Then I'll have their heart.
I think about that.

01:07:35.809 --> 01:07:37.800
Yep.

01:07:38.978 --> 01:07:42.038
So, we wait.

01:07:42.115 --> 01:07:47.052
It may take a little while
before we have a heart to harvest.

01:07:48.888 --> 01:07:51.186
I know.

01:07:51.257 --> 01:07:54.954
Mr. Maris, it's always a good idea
to set your affairs in order.

01:07:56.362 --> 01:07:59.889
My affairs are in order.

01:08:01.568 --> 01:08:03.559
Good.

01:08:04.704 --> 01:08:07.229
I have confidence in you.

01:08:11.945 --> 01:08:13.412
OK.

01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:22.911
Thank you.

01:08:38.904 --> 01:08:40.895
Dr. MacKee.

01:08:45.278 --> 01:08:47.939
I want you to have another MRI.

01:08:49.182 --> 01:08:53.118
- Really? Why?
- Your exams were not what we'd like.

01:08:53.185 --> 01:08:56.279
I spoke to Dr. Abbott, she agreed.

01:08:56.356 --> 01:09:00.314
We'll do the MRI, and then I think
you should talk with her.

01:09:00.393 --> 01:09:02.917
What do you mean,
"Not what we'd like"?

01:09:03.763 --> 01:09:07.493
We had hoped to be seeing
some reduction in the tumor by now.

01:09:07.566 --> 01:09:09.557
We haven't.

01:09:11.870 --> 01:09:14.634
I'm sorry.

01:09:26.118 --> 01:09:28.109
Come on.

01:09:38.897 --> 01:09:42.162
I came up here when they finally
diagnosed my tumor.

01:09:46.438 --> 01:09:49.965
I thought I'd throw myself over the edge.

01:09:50.042 --> 01:09:53.102
God, I was so...

01:09:53.178 --> 01:09:58.946
I felt... like my skin was coming off.

01:09:59.818 --> 01:10:03.276
Oh, I screamed and screamed and...

01:10:04.990 --> 01:10:10.360
There was... there was this bird
perched right over there.

01:10:11.063 --> 01:10:16.126
And it just looks at me real strange,

01:10:16.201 --> 01:10:21.161
like "Lady, what is your problem?"

01:10:25.143 --> 01:10:29.842
And I laughed.
I felt so stupid that I just...

01:10:31.149 --> 01:10:33.549
laughed out loud.

01:10:35.787 --> 01:10:37.778
You know what?

01:10:39.458 --> 01:10:42.120
I think it was an angel.

01:10:51.403 --> 01:10:54.236
Go ahead and scream.
No one can hear you.

01:10:59.945 --> 01:11:02.277
I don't wanna scream.

01:11:03.181 --> 01:11:08.744
- Go ahead and jump.
- I don't wanna jump.

01:11:11.256 --> 01:11:15.317
Then fight it. Fight it!

01:11:31.877 --> 01:11:37.645
That tour, that tour...
is that still happening?

01:11:37.716 --> 01:11:41.846
- What tour?
- The Indians, the dancers.

01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:44.582
- I think so.
- Good.

01:11:44.656 --> 01:11:46.590
If they're in New York, we're in trouble.

01:11:46.658 --> 01:11:49.923
But we might find
they're just down the block.

01:11:49.995 --> 01:11:55.831
- I can't do that. I can't go.
- I'll take care of it. It's my treat.

01:11:55.901 --> 01:11:58.768
No, no, no. It's not that. It's just...

01:11:58.837 --> 01:12:03.672
Excuse me, is this my intrepid friend
or not? We're going!

01:12:05.410 --> 01:12:07.310
Come on.

01:12:07.379 --> 01:12:11.076
Wait, this is crazy. Look at me.
I'm not dressed for a...

01:12:11.149 --> 01:12:15.518
You look great. OK, Carrie,
call me back when you know.

01:12:15.587 --> 01:12:20.581
- Hi. Winnemucca?
- Nevada.

01:12:20.659 --> 01:12:24.720
We fly to Reno, we drive
for two hours into the desert.

01:12:24.796 --> 01:12:27.390
OK, what do we need?
We need two tickets to Reno, a car,

01:12:27.466 --> 01:12:29.457
and two tickets to the concert.

01:12:29.534 --> 01:12:32.264
No, it's for me and a Miss June Ellis.

01:12:32.337 --> 01:12:36.171
You got that?
Thanks, Carrie, you're great.

01:12:38.343 --> 01:12:41.870
Can you just pickup and go like this?

01:12:44.549 --> 01:12:48.610
"I see my tumor giving me certain
freedoms I never allowed myself."

01:12:54.559 --> 01:13:00.498
I had a strange,
wonderful dream last night.

01:13:01.533 --> 01:13:08.234
I flew right over your house
with a full head of hair.

01:13:21.420 --> 01:13:24.014
I love that song.

01:13:47.112 --> 01:13:51.071
- Can we stop?
- You mean, take a break or...?

01:13:51.148 --> 01:13:53.981
No, I mean, just stop.

01:13:54.785 --> 01:13:58.585
OK, I just... I'm a little nervous
about missing the concert, the Indians.

01:13:58.656 --> 01:14:04.151
Jack... it wasn't the concert.

01:14:04.895 --> 01:14:07.796
It's the time.

01:14:07.865 --> 01:14:12.097
It's rushing past me.

01:14:12.169 --> 01:14:15.002
I don't wanna rush past this.

01:14:15.072 --> 01:14:20.135
I don't wanna rush past
anything anymore. I can't.

01:14:20.878 --> 01:14:23.506
I just can't, Jack.

01:14:25.049 --> 01:14:27.813
Anything. Anything you want.

01:14:30.087 --> 01:14:32.954
I'm sorry
for dragging you out here.

01:14:34.558 --> 01:14:39.461
"Get in, fix it, get out."

01:14:39.530 --> 01:14:42.328
That's what I tell my residents.

01:14:43.067 --> 01:14:46.798
She missed her concert,
take her to the concert.

01:14:51.809 --> 01:14:56.769
You know what's special to me, Jack?
I mean, truly special?

01:14:59.683 --> 01:15:01.674
This.

01:15:04.989 --> 01:15:06.980
This.

01:15:13.497 --> 01:15:15.488
Now.

01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:26.938
Do you pray, June?
Is that what holds you together?

01:15:28.412 --> 01:15:30.846
Oh, I pray.

01:15:34.251 --> 01:15:36.412
I meditate.

01:15:37.087 --> 01:15:39.419
I eat chocolate.

01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:45.528
I go dancing.

01:18:52.849 --> 01:18:55.875
<i>- Hello?
- Anne, did I wake you?</i>

01:18:55.952 --> 01:19:01.584
Oh, God. Jack, where are you?

01:19:02.158 --> 01:19:06.891
I don't know. I'm in the desert,
in a phone booth

01:19:06.963 --> 01:19:08.988
somewhere between Reno and home.

01:19:09.065 --> 01:19:15.004
Why? What are you doing, Jack, huh?

01:19:15.071 --> 01:19:20.168
I went a little crazy. I'm OK.
I'll explain in the morning.

01:19:20.243 --> 01:19:22.973
No, no, no, no. Tell me now.

01:19:23.045 --> 01:19:26.742
<i>- I can't.
- Just tell me, OK?</i>

01:19:30.219 --> 01:19:35.020
<i>- I don't think the radiation is working.
- Oh. God...</i>

01:19:36.459 --> 01:19:40.896
<i>- They don't seem to think it's working.
- Oh. Sweetheart.</i>

01:19:40.963 --> 01:19:43.329
Let me come and get you.

01:19:45.468 --> 01:19:51.634
<i>- I'm with a fellow patient.
- Oh...</i>

01:19:51.707 --> 01:19:53.834
She's a friend, Anne.

01:19:55.445 --> 01:19:59.245
<i>She has a brain tumor.</i>

01:20:00.049 --> 01:20:03.644
<i>Oh. I missed the plane.</i>

01:20:03.719 --> 01:20:06.586
I'll be home in the morning.

01:20:06.656 --> 01:20:10.148
<i>Good night. Jack.</i>

01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:08.376
- I'm late.
- Anne, can we meet?

01:21:08.451 --> 01:21:11.909
Can I find you and talk?

01:21:14.690 --> 01:21:16.885
You're breaking my heart, Jack.

01:21:25.134 --> 01:21:26.863
- "Where's my lung?"
- Where's my lung?

01:21:26.936 --> 01:21:28.836
That's exactly what he said,
this is two years later.

01:21:28.905 --> 01:21:30.463
No, it's true.
Apparently he'd seen some shrink

01:21:30.540 --> 01:21:32.599
who told him he was suffering
from "organ bereavement".

01:21:32.675 --> 01:21:36.111
He should ask for his lung back.
I told him he should dial 1-900-LUNG.

01:21:36.178 --> 01:21:39.614
Yeah. "Hello, remember me?
I want my lung back."

01:21:39.682 --> 01:21:43.448
I don't believe it. It's Mr. Dribble.
The guy's a fruitcake.

01:21:43.519 --> 01:21:47.751
- That's your patient.
- That's Richards? What's he doing?

01:21:47.823 --> 01:21:51.190
I saved the guy's life,
and then he just fucks me over.

01:21:54.664 --> 01:22:00.364
- He's suing me. Is that crap?
- See you later.

01:22:00.436 --> 01:22:06.705
Jack, where are you going? Jack!
The guy's taking us to court!

01:22:10.813 --> 01:22:13.077
I'm telling you, man. It's unbelievable.

01:22:13.149 --> 01:22:19.019
- Hey, Mister, you need a hand?
- Keys. Locked... car.

01:22:20.323 --> 01:22:22.723
I'm sorry, you lost your keys?

01:22:22.792 --> 01:22:29.561
Locked... Keys. Locked. In car.

01:22:29.632 --> 01:22:35.662
You locked your keys in the car. Oh, my.

01:22:35.738 --> 01:22:39.299
I'm late. Speech therapy.

01:22:39.375 --> 01:22:42.936
Look, you go on ahead.
I work here at the hospital.

01:22:43.012 --> 01:22:47.813
I'll have your keys left for you at the front
desk. I come equipped. I'll make a call.

01:22:47.883 --> 01:22:50.113
It's not a problem.

01:22:51.854 --> 01:22:57.087
Name is... Richards.

01:22:58.661 --> 01:23:03.064
Mr. Richards? Don't worry.
It's not a problem.

01:23:03.766 --> 01:23:07.964
This... just driving me crazy.

01:23:19.482 --> 01:23:22.713
- It's gonna be OK.
- Thank you.

01:23:25.654 --> 01:23:28.452
Aahhh...

01:23:28.523 --> 01:23:30.514
OK.

01:23:32.394 --> 01:23:36.888
I'd make a gag,
but I'm busy gagging.

01:23:39.801 --> 01:23:42.269
How's it look?

01:23:44.372 --> 01:23:47.705
Well, I think Dr. Reed
had already mentioned that the, um,

01:23:47.776 --> 01:23:50.404
the tumor had gotten bigger.

01:23:52.981 --> 01:23:56.974
No. No, no!

01:23:57.052 --> 01:24:00.954
He said it was worried it hadn't
gotten smaller. He didn't... Is it bigger?

01:24:01.022 --> 01:24:06.892
It's disappointing because we, uh... we
get a very good cure rate with radiation.

01:24:08.329 --> 01:24:11.594
Yeah, that's disappointing as hell.

01:24:14.369 --> 01:24:17.361
Look, look. OK, I'm asking.
This is torture.

01:24:17.439 --> 01:24:21.432
What is the prognosis on my
vocal cords? Can you save them?

01:24:22.043 --> 01:24:26.776
I won't know until I'm there.
But that would be the idea, yes.

01:24:29.284 --> 01:24:31.878
Maria? Yeah, I'm looking at moving

01:24:31.953 --> 01:24:35.650
the tongue or the parotid a day or two
to make way for the laryngeal.

01:24:35.724 --> 01:24:40.058
Or the other option is doing
the adenoids late on the 20th.

01:24:40.128 --> 01:24:44.895
Yeah, that works. Adenoids late on the
20th and laryngeal afternoon of the 18th.

01:24:44.966 --> 01:24:49.733
No. No, I don't want you
cutting me in the afternoon.

01:24:49.804 --> 01:24:50.793
Excuse me?

01:24:50.872 --> 01:24:53.136
You'll be tired in the afternoon,
and ragged and hungry.

01:24:53.208 --> 01:24:56.700
You'll have been on your feet for hours.

01:24:56.778 --> 01:25:00.544
Come on, we both know how it is.

01:25:00.615 --> 01:25:03.209
I am the doctor and you are my patient.

01:25:03.284 --> 01:25:06.913
And I am telling you
when I am available.

01:25:07.956 --> 01:25:11.448
Now let's get this thing out
before it does any more damage.

01:25:35.884 --> 01:25:37.875
Knife.

01:25:44.425 --> 01:25:46.484
Let's go, boy.

01:25:53.001 --> 01:25:57.165
- Are you OK, Doctor?
- Jack?

01:26:10.618 --> 01:26:12.745
Let's go, Jacko.

01:26:23.031 --> 01:26:25.659
OK, here we go.

01:26:47.722 --> 01:26:49.713
It's Jack.

01:26:55.830 --> 01:26:58.025
I lost it.

01:26:58.733 --> 01:27:02.692
June, I lost it today.

01:27:05.340 --> 01:27:08.434
I should go home. It's too late, I'll go.

01:27:09.043 --> 01:27:12.308
No, it's OK. It's OK. Come in.

01:27:12.380 --> 01:27:16.840
And then, there's Anne. But...

01:27:18.686 --> 01:27:22.144
No, you know.

01:27:22.223 --> 01:27:28.093
Um, I'll go. This is terrible.
I woke you up.

01:27:29.130 --> 01:27:32.361
"There's Anne, but..."?

01:27:32.433 --> 01:27:35.732
I don't know. I don't know.

01:27:36.971 --> 01:27:39.235
I don't know.

01:27:42.677 --> 01:27:48.411
I've kept her there, you know,
over there, for so long.

01:27:48.483 --> 01:27:54.422
And now... I can't get my arm down.

01:28:01.529 --> 01:28:03.793
I have to have the operation, June.

01:28:11.705 --> 01:28:13.764
I'm sorry.

01:29:15.736 --> 01:29:18.034
Excuse me, you can't go...

01:29:19.439 --> 01:29:22.806
Dr. MacKee's headed back there.
You'd better come out.

01:29:25.712 --> 01:29:29.170
Dr. MacKee. What is it?

01:29:30.250 --> 01:29:31.945
Do you have a minute?

01:29:32.019 --> 01:29:35.921
You can see for yourself.
I have a waiting room full of patients.

01:29:35.989 --> 01:29:39.254
- One fewer.
- What?

01:29:39.326 --> 01:29:42.489
You have one fewer patients. I'm out.

01:29:42.562 --> 01:29:44.996
Look, Doctor, I know
how you must be feeling.

01:29:45.065 --> 01:29:50.799
That's the problem. You don't have
the first idea what I'm feeling.

01:29:52.072 --> 01:29:55.508
I think we better continue this
conversation some other time.

01:29:55.575 --> 01:29:59.102
I think you ought to brush up
your act, Dr. Abbott.

01:29:59.179 --> 01:30:00.737
Because today I'm sick.

01:30:00.814 --> 01:30:05.376
Tomorrow or the day after
or 30 years from now, you'll be sick.

01:30:05.452 --> 01:30:10.685
Every doctor becomes a patient
somewhere down the line, and then...

01:30:11.425 --> 01:30:15.293
it'll hit you as hard as it's hit me.

01:30:16.263 --> 01:30:18.731
I'm finding you very offensive,
so if you don't mind...

01:30:18.799 --> 01:30:20.790
Sure.

01:30:22.969 --> 01:30:27.235
If I had a patient like me
when I was a doctor like you, I'd...

01:30:27.307 --> 01:30:32.301
I'll just... wait for my file.

01:30:33.213 --> 01:30:35.374
I'll get you your file.

01:30:50.263 --> 01:30:54.461
Airmail. Thank you.

01:31:04.511 --> 01:31:06.741
- Eli...
- Jack.

01:31:08.281 --> 01:31:11.375
- May I speak with you for a minute?
- Sure.

01:31:22.062 --> 01:31:24.997
I need a partial laryngectomy.

01:31:27.567 --> 01:31:31.128
Would you do it?
I don't know a doctor I trust more.

01:31:33.907 --> 01:31:36.171
I'll do it tomorrow.

01:31:39.279 --> 01:31:41.679
Tomorrow...

01:31:41.748 --> 01:31:46.981
Yeah, I'm not working,
so... we'll get you in.

01:31:47.053 --> 01:31:49.044
Thank you.

01:31:50.790 --> 01:31:54.658
You know, I've been pretty...

01:31:55.495 --> 01:32:02.401
No, very insulting about you in the past...

01:32:02.469 --> 01:32:04.960
which I'm ashamed of.

01:32:05.038 --> 01:32:07.871
<i>Dr. Blumfield. Ready in two.</i>

01:32:07.941 --> 01:32:13.174
Yeah, well, that's OK, Jack. I, um...

01:32:13.246 --> 01:32:17.945
I've always wanted to slit your throat.

01:32:18.018 --> 01:32:23.479
Now I'm gonna get a chance to do that.

01:32:32.966 --> 01:32:35.594
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:32:41.875 --> 01:32:44.867
Murray, can I speak to you, please?

01:32:44.945 --> 01:32:47.607
- What's wrong?
- Let's go in here.

01:32:54.587 --> 01:32:59.581
- What's going on?
- I have to have surgery on my throat.

01:32:59.658 --> 01:33:06.257
- A partial laryngectomy.
- Jesus, Jack. Why didn't you say?

01:33:06.332 --> 01:33:09.859
I knew you were jumpy,
and then yesterday...

01:33:09.935 --> 01:33:13.393
I was saying to Pete,
I thought it was me or something.

01:33:13.472 --> 01:33:16.441
- I asked Eli Blumfield.
- The Rabbi?

01:33:16.508 --> 01:33:20.945
It's tomorrow. I trust him.
I don't wanna lose my voice.

01:33:22.648 --> 01:33:25.481
Well, me neither. I need you talking.

01:33:25.551 --> 01:33:27.883
Tomorrow...

01:33:27.953 --> 01:33:30.251
But even if I can talk...

01:33:33.058 --> 01:33:35.424
I won't be testifying.

01:33:37.029 --> 01:33:38.860
Say that again?

01:33:38.931 --> 01:33:40.990
I won't testify because I tell the truth

01:33:41.066 --> 01:33:44.035
and the truth is that poor guy
had a history of thrombophlebitis.

01:33:44.103 --> 01:33:48.540
- Well, how did you know that?
- I called his internist.

01:33:48.607 --> 01:33:52.407
What'd you think?
You could just tear up his records?

01:33:53.746 --> 01:33:58.479
It's not relevant, Jack.
You could argue as an expert.

01:33:58.550 --> 01:34:00.211
No.

01:34:03.689 --> 01:34:08.991
What did you do this for, huh?
Checking up on me?

01:34:09.061 --> 01:34:12.758
You wanted a witness.
I wanted to know what I was witnessing.

01:34:15.367 --> 01:34:17.961
14 years is what you're witnessing.

01:34:18.037 --> 01:34:21.268
Me covering your tail,
you covering mine.

01:34:21.340 --> 01:34:27.370
Why did you pull his file?
You can't do that.

01:34:32.117 --> 01:34:37.521
It's not relevant. It's a judgment thing.

01:34:39.291 --> 01:34:42.021
I'm sorry, Murray.

01:34:43.696 --> 01:34:46.062
No, no.

01:34:47.433 --> 01:34:51.426
It's not just me, partner.

01:34:51.503 --> 01:34:54.836
Your neck is on the fucking line, too.

01:34:56.308 --> 01:34:59.971
Yeah, that's right.

01:35:02.314 --> 01:35:05.374
Jack, you're killing me.

01:35:05.451 --> 01:35:08.215
I have a surgery.
I'll find someone else to help me out.

01:35:08.287 --> 01:35:13.224
Jack, hell you will. Hey, Jacko.

01:35:13.292 --> 01:35:15.385
Jack!

01:35:24.703 --> 01:35:27.729
Carrie told me about your surgery.

01:35:30.209 --> 01:35:32.234
I was going to...

01:35:35.214 --> 01:35:37.648
Oh, Anne...

01:35:38.717 --> 01:35:42.983
Yeah, well, that's how I find out
most things about us, you know.

01:35:44.423 --> 01:35:49.952
Dinner dates, messages,
your problems...

01:35:50.028 --> 01:35:52.462
through your secretary.

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:59.266
It's the 28th, is that right?

01:36:01.774 --> 01:36:04.106
It's tomorrow.

01:36:07.546 --> 01:36:09.605
Tomorrow?

01:36:12.684 --> 01:36:14.811
Eli Blumfield's gonna do me.

01:36:17.322 --> 01:36:20.223
You heard that from me first.

01:36:24.496 --> 01:36:30.662
Last night... Did you go
to your friend? June?

01:36:32.070 --> 01:36:34.766
Yes, I did.

01:36:38.677 --> 01:36:44.741
You know what I resent?
I don't resent her.

01:36:44.817 --> 01:36:50.949
Truly, I... I'm sure she's...
She must be very special.

01:36:54.226 --> 01:36:56.660
It's just that...

01:37:00.332 --> 01:37:04.166
You have a friend to go to. You know?

01:37:04.236 --> 01:37:08.263
And you were always my friend,

01:37:08.340 --> 01:37:11.639
and... now I can't go to you.

01:37:13.579 --> 01:37:17.481
Anyway, blah-blah-blah. I have to go.

01:37:26.758 --> 01:37:29.022
You know, it's funny.

01:37:29.995 --> 01:37:33.863
I wake up every morning,
and I have this... this feeling.

01:37:33.932 --> 01:37:36.833
This sensation.

01:37:37.702 --> 01:37:40.136
And I didn't know what it was.

01:37:40.671 --> 01:37:46.541
What is it? Am I hungry? Am I tired?

01:37:46.611 --> 01:37:48.909
Am I sad?

01:37:50.715 --> 01:37:54.947
Then I realized... I'm just lonely.

01:38:36.193 --> 01:38:38.184
June?

01:38:39.830 --> 01:38:42.799
- June, it's Jack.
- I don't think she can hear you.

01:39:14.465 --> 01:39:17.798
It's me. It's Jack.

01:39:21.205 --> 01:39:25.073
And I came over last night
and I made you so tired.

01:39:29.180 --> 01:39:32.672
I have my operation tomorrow.

01:39:33.551 --> 01:39:38.454
And selfish to the end, I was hoping
you'd be there to help me through it.

01:39:41.425 --> 01:39:43.757
Oh, June...

01:39:43.828 --> 01:39:49.391
I'm... I'm really terrified.

01:39:50.034 --> 01:39:55.233
That's the truth... which I got from you.

01:39:55.306 --> 01:39:57.297
The truth.

01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:07.850
Do you know, I don't even
know anything about you.

01:40:08.552 --> 01:40:10.543
Not really.

01:40:13.457 --> 01:40:19.191
I know you love life.
And I know you can dance.

01:40:21.666 --> 01:40:25.625
I hope you always fly over my house...

01:40:26.904 --> 01:40:29.805
<i>with your lovely long hair.</i>

01:41:03.407 --> 01:41:06.308
My friend June died today.

01:41:46.650 --> 01:41:49.619
How you doing, Jack?

01:41:49.687 --> 01:41:52.155
I'd rather be in Philadelphia.

01:42:01.499 --> 01:42:07.404
- Hi, Doctor.
- Nancy. Hi.

01:42:07.471 --> 01:42:10.838
My, my, my.

01:42:10.908 --> 01:42:14.605
- We're rooting for you, Jack.
- Thank you, Joe.

01:42:14.678 --> 01:42:17.909
Yeah, do. Root like crazy.

01:42:21.752 --> 01:42:24.050
Did you find it? Great.

01:42:24.120 --> 01:42:29.490
OK, Jack, your neck feels clear to me.

01:42:30.527 --> 01:42:32.518
Good.

01:42:34.097 --> 01:42:37.362
I'm gonna keep telling you everything
that I'm doing as I'm doing it.

01:42:37.433 --> 01:42:41.130
So I want you to just relax
as much as possible.

01:42:41.204 --> 01:42:46.608
And before I scrub in,
we have a little treat for you.

01:43:16.706 --> 01:43:20.904
Oh...

01:44:01.017 --> 01:44:05.044
We got the tumor, and there was
no cross-over, which is good.

01:44:05.121 --> 01:44:07.555
It's great.

01:44:07.624 --> 01:44:10.115
I was not able to save
all of the vocal cords,

01:44:10.193 --> 01:44:16.996
so I... I can't make any guarantees
about the voice, Anne.

01:44:18.434 --> 01:44:23.030
It was very clean,
and we're just gonna have

01:44:23.106 --> 01:44:26.507
to wait and see.

01:44:27.243 --> 01:44:32.374
- Are you OK here?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine, thanks.

01:44:43.893 --> 01:44:45.884
Nicky?

01:45:18.061 --> 01:45:20.689
I meant to give this
to you at the hospital.

01:45:27.603 --> 01:45:29.594
Sorry.

01:46:25.061 --> 01:46:27.325
That's not the color I asked for!

01:46:27.397 --> 01:46:30.161
No, I wanted the wall
to match the cupboard!

01:46:30.233 --> 01:46:32.497
How many times
do I have to tell you that?

01:46:32.568 --> 01:46:36.902
We sat down yesterday and I circled
the one I wanted. Remember that?

01:46:36.973 --> 01:46:41.740
Yeah... Oh, great, so now I'm color-blind
on top of everything else?

01:46:42.378 --> 01:46:45.506
I know what I was doing.
This is what you asked for.

01:46:45.581 --> 01:46:47.845
- Terrific.
- Well, I warned you that color...

01:46:47.917 --> 01:46:50.818
Look, just forget it!
I'll paint it myself, OK?

01:46:56.726 --> 01:46:59.661
Jack, let go of me. What are you doing?

01:46:59.729 --> 01:47:03.130
I don't wanna go outside. Jack!

01:47:05.968 --> 01:47:07.959
No!

01:47:08.504 --> 01:47:12.463
No, I don't wanna yell at you.
I want to go inside! Do you mind?

01:47:13.375 --> 01:47:15.434
Yeah, right. And now it's done.
Are you happy?

01:47:15.510 --> 01:47:19.241
Now would you please
let me go inside? God, Jack.

01:47:19.815 --> 01:47:22.409
You're crazy.

01:47:22.484 --> 01:47:26.215
Jack, stop it. Jack, stop it!

01:47:26.288 --> 01:47:28.916
Stop it, OK! OK.

01:47:28.990 --> 01:47:30.855
But get in the house.
If you want me to yell at you,

01:47:30.926 --> 01:47:34.555
I'll yell at you in the house, OK?
Now get inside!

01:47:37.766 --> 01:47:39.757
Jack!

01:47:41.403 --> 01:47:44.133
Look, Jack, I don't know
what you want from me.

01:48:02.924 --> 01:48:07.293
No, you don't. You don't need me.
No, I don't believe you.

01:48:07.362 --> 01:48:10.991
I was there. I was there for you, Jack,
and you didn't need me.

01:48:31.086 --> 01:48:36.183
Yeah, me, too. Me, too.

01:48:43.765 --> 01:48:47.633
Stop it! Stop blowing that thing! Stop it!

01:48:50.005 --> 01:48:51.996
Stop it!

01:48:57.679 --> 01:49:01.706
"Start again"? Jesus...

01:49:01.783 --> 01:49:04.013
Jack, stop it!

01:49:04.085 --> 01:49:08.215
Stop it! Stop it! God...

01:49:08.290 --> 01:49:10.281
Goddamn it!

01:49:45.160 --> 01:49:49.256
I just wish I'd never given you
this stupid whistle!

01:49:53.034 --> 01:49:56.470
I love you.

01:49:56.538 --> 01:49:58.529
I love you.

01:50:00.642 --> 01:50:03.406
You're talking.

01:50:06.248 --> 01:50:08.239
Shh.

01:50:42.817 --> 01:50:44.808
Aah!

01:50:51.459 --> 01:50:54.428
Hello, Jack. Welcome back.

01:51:02.904 --> 01:51:04.895
So...

01:51:06.708 --> 01:51:08.835
They're harvesting the heart
any minute now.

01:51:08.910 --> 01:51:14.507
It'll be flown in from New York,
whence all good things come.

01:51:31.166 --> 01:51:33.760
- What's the problem?
- Nothing, Doctor.

01:51:33.835 --> 01:51:35.826
What?

01:51:37.072 --> 01:51:40.371
My wife wants to know what's
impossible to know about the donor.

01:51:40.442 --> 01:51:44.640
She thinks because we say
things like "kindhearted"...

01:51:44.713 --> 01:51:49.650
"good-hearted"... that these
qualities come from the heart.

01:51:52.554 --> 01:51:55.216
Tell her I think they do.

01:52:27.354 --> 01:52:29.413
Yes?

01:52:29.490 --> 01:52:33.483
The helicopter's landed.
15 minutes, Doctor.

01:52:33.560 --> 01:52:36.222
Thank you, Nancy.

01:52:36.296 --> 01:52:40.790
Arturo... here we go.

01:52:44.438 --> 01:52:46.235
- Here you go. Good luck.
- Thanks.

01:52:50.611 --> 01:52:54.911
OK. We're all hooked up.

01:52:54.982 --> 01:52:58.145
Watch your flow
and watch your pressure.

01:53:00.654 --> 01:53:05.284
Ross clamp is... off.

01:53:16.236 --> 01:53:19.672
Start beating, sweetheart.

01:53:27.247 --> 01:53:31.149
Go, heart!

01:53:40.594 --> 01:53:43.961
Your wife will be delighted, Arturo.

01:53:53.006 --> 01:53:55.440
It's a beautiful heart.

01:54:12.926 --> 01:54:15.656
Any messages for me?

01:54:15.729 --> 01:54:18.197
These... and something personal.

01:54:18.265 --> 01:54:21.462
Oh, thanks.

01:54:24.505 --> 01:54:27.804
It's been an hour already.
I'm out of here, people.

01:54:27.875 --> 01:54:29.206
- Hasn't been an hour.
- Yeah, it has.

01:54:29.276 --> 01:54:32.211
Hi! Sorry, I kept you waiting.

01:54:32.279 --> 01:54:34.770
Good, good, good.

01:54:34.848 --> 01:54:37.214
OK, well.

01:54:39.319 --> 01:54:43.380
Can you strip naked and put on your
hospital gowns, quick as you can?

01:54:47.361 --> 01:54:51.559
- Dr. MacKee, this is a joke.
- I'm not laughing. Ah, here they are.

01:54:51.632 --> 01:54:57.628
Alan, Roger, Lonnie...

01:54:57.704 --> 01:55:03.870
- Let's go. Sarah, Jay-Jay, Michael.
- Anything in a paisley?

01:55:14.087 --> 01:55:16.078
Doctors...

01:55:18.525 --> 01:55:23.588
You have spent a lot of time
learning the Latin names

01:55:23.664 --> 01:55:28.124
for diseases your patients might have.

01:55:28.201 --> 01:55:31.637
Now it's time to learn...

01:55:31.705 --> 01:55:34.299
something simpler about them.

01:55:34.374 --> 01:55:37.969
Patients have their own names.

01:55:38.045 --> 01:55:40.036
Sarah.

01:55:40.747 --> 01:55:44.581
Alan. Jack.

01:55:45.686 --> 01:55:49.383
They feel frightened...

01:55:50.824 --> 01:55:53.258
embarrassed and vulnerable.

01:55:53.327 --> 01:55:58.993
And they feel sick.
Most of all, they want to get better.

01:55:59.499 --> 01:56:02.127
Because of that...

01:56:05.639 --> 01:56:09.097
they put their lives in our hands.

01:56:10.844 --> 01:56:14.644
I could try to explain what that means
until I'm blue in the face.

01:56:14.715 --> 01:56:17.946
But, you know something,
it wouldn't mean a thing.

01:56:19.453 --> 01:56:22.547
It sure as hell never did to me.

01:56:25.926 --> 01:56:28.724
So, for the next 72 hours,

01:56:28.795 --> 01:56:32.856
you'll each be allocated
a particular disease.

01:56:35.335 --> 01:56:39.965
You'll sleep in hospital beds,
eat hospital food.

01:56:40.039 --> 01:56:42.803
Hospital food?

01:56:42.875 --> 01:56:49.576
You'll be given all the appropriate tests.
Tests you will one day prescribe.

01:56:49.649 --> 01:56:51.844
Unbelievable.

01:56:54.053 --> 01:57:00.458
You are no longer... doctors.
You are hospital patients.

01:57:08.968 --> 01:57:14.167
So, good luck. I'll see you on my rounds.

01:57:36.495 --> 01:57:39.123
<i>Dear Jack...</i>

01:57:39.198 --> 01:57:44.500
<i>You've just left. And I've been
sitting here worrying about you.</i>

01:57:44.570 --> 01:57:50.031
<i>You were talking about Anne
and not knowing how to let her close.</i>

01:57:50.109 --> 01:57:52.509
<i>How to let anyone close.</i>

01:57:52.578 --> 01:57:57.379
<i>And I thought of this little story for you.</i>

01:57:57.450 --> 01:58:00.851
<i>I hope you get it before your operation.</i>

01:58:03.723 --> 01:58:05.714
Going up?

01:58:10.129 --> 01:58:13.292
<i>There was a farmer
who had a lot of fields.</i>

01:58:13.365 --> 01:58:17.665
<i>And he kept all of the birds
and creatures away from his crops</i>

01:58:17.737 --> 01:58:20.638
<i>with traps and fences.</i>

01:58:20.706 --> 01:58:24.904
<i>He was very successful.
But he was very lonely.</i>

01:58:26.212 --> 01:58:29.375
<i>So. One day. He stood in the middle</i>

01:58:29.448 --> 01:58:33.544
<i>of his fields to welcome the animals.</i>

01:58:33.619 --> 01:58:40.047
<i>He stayed there from dawn to dusk with
his arms outstretched calling to them.</i>

01:58:40.659 --> 01:58:45.790
<i>But not a single animal came.
Not a single creature appeared.</i>

01:58:48.267 --> 01:58:54.297
<i>They were terrified. You see.
Of the farmer's new scarecrow.</i>

01:58:56.742 --> 01:59:02.044
<i>Dear Jack. Just let down your arms...</i>

01:59:02.114 --> 01:59:05.345
<i>and we'll all come to you.</i>
