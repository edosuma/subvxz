- So we're at Blockbuster Video,
right?

02:17.196 --> 02:19.171
'Cause this was the 90s.
- The 1890s.

02:19.365 --> 02:20.714
- Bitch, do you wanna hear
my story or not?

02:20.790 --> 02:22.290
- Tell your story, mama.

02:22.476 --> 02:25.218
- So Derek goes,
"Oh! Sophie's Choice.
I've heard of this movie.

02:25.295 --> 02:27.980
It's supposed to be hilarious."
- Shut up.

02:28.131 --> 02:32.042
- So we go down to my parents'
basement, roll a joint
and start the movie.

02:32.044 --> 02:32.818
And say nothing.
- You seen my bag?

02:32.895 --> 02:34.561
- Don't even look at each other.

02:34.804 --> 02:37.381
Until we're three hours in,
and Meryl's like in the camps
or whatever,

02:37.474 --> 02:41.309
and finally I turn to Derek
and I go, "Girl, I don't think
this is a comedy."

02:41.328 --> 02:43.162
- Shut up!
- Lies and fairytales...

02:43.238 --> 02:45.146
- It's the damn truth.
You want me to call Derek?

02:45.166 --> 02:47.073
- Dammit, Layla!
These are all wet.

02:47.150 --> 02:49.075
- Girl, change at home
like the rest of us.

02:49.152 --> 02:52.045
- It's ten below zero.
My nipples are gonna
freeze right off.

02:52.155 --> 02:53.988
- A loan, bitch!

02:54.008 --> 02:56.425
Dry clean only.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.678
- Wait a minute now.

02:59.905 --> 03:01.555
(belches)
- Ooh, girl!

03:02.999 --> 03:05.726
(indistinct chatter)

03:08.505 --> 03:10.430
- Oh, look at her!

03:10.582 --> 03:12.691
- Hey, sweetheart!

03:12.768 --> 03:13.859
Sweetheart.

03:13.936 --> 03:15.419
You all by yourself?

03:15.421 --> 03:18.197
(laughter)
Well, excuse me very much.

03:18.273 --> 03:21.182
- No, no, no!
- What, I say the wrong thing?

03:21.202 --> 03:24.036
Or you just deaf or somethin'?
(glass breaking)

03:24.705 --> 03:28.457
- Oh, I'm sorry, honey,
I hurt your feelings?

03:29.710 --> 03:31.117
You feelin' pressed?

03:31.194 --> 03:32.953
- That's a freakin' dude!
- Nice one, Matty.

03:33.105 --> 03:34.362
- No need to be embarrassed.

03:34.381 --> 03:36.957
Maybe your lil' guy
knows somethin' you don't.

03:37.033 --> 03:39.051
- Excuse me?
- Pheromones, baby.

03:39.127 --> 03:40.777
Facts are facts.

03:40.796 --> 03:43.447
- What did you say?
- What? You gonna hit a lady?

03:43.465 --> 03:45.373
- You ain't no lady!
You're a freak.

03:45.392 --> 03:47.467
- Your mother's a freak.
- Taxi!

03:47.544 --> 03:50.120
- Guys, come on.
- I'm fine, let go of me.

03:50.122 --> 03:52.122
Ya freak!

03:52.124 --> 03:54.215
Guys, keep goin',
I'm gonna get him home.

03:54.235 --> 03:55.976
- Yeah, man.
(guys laughing)

03:56.128 --> 03:58.070
- (indistinct)
(taxi driver): Yup.

03:58.221 --> 04:01.031
(indistinct chatter)

04:03.135 --> 04:06.078
- Man, I feel a little bit down.

04:06.229 --> 04:08.538
(sirens wailing in the distance)

04:10.492 --> 04:12.659
(phone beeping)

04:12.811 --> 04:15.069
- Dammit. Come on...

04:15.089 --> 04:17.381
- Hey.
Hey, you okay?

04:18.742 --> 04:20.000
- Tip top, honey.

04:20.152 --> 04:21.409
- Alright, good.

04:21.428 --> 04:24.096
- Look, I'm sorry
about my brother,

04:24.247 --> 04:27.415
he's a dick when he's pissed.

04:27.493 --> 04:29.843
- What's his excuse
the rest of the time?

04:29.995 --> 04:32.104
(chuckles)
- I dunno.

04:33.682 --> 04:36.358
Hey, how far are you goin'?

04:37.427 --> 04:39.519
- Dorchester.

04:39.596 --> 04:41.838
- Do you want a ride?
Mine's pullin' up right now.

04:41.840 --> 04:43.615
- No, thanks.

04:48.363 --> 04:50.847
I mean, you sure?
I'm in Quincy.

04:50.866 --> 04:52.624
It's on the way.

04:54.128 --> 04:56.461
C'mon, it's freezin' out here.
Come on.

04:58.299 --> 05:00.206
Hey, bro, it's gonna be
two stops actually.

05:00.283 --> 05:03.051
- No problem.
- I'm Jamie.

05:04.788 --> 05:06.046
- Robyn.

05:06.198 --> 05:08.031
- Nice to meet you, Robyn.

05:08.050 --> 05:09.791
(clicking on phone)

05:09.810 --> 05:12.552
- I don't do chasers.
So we're clear.

05:12.629 --> 05:13.553
- Sorry?

05:14.481 --> 05:16.964
- You're not getting laid
tonight.

05:17.042 --> 05:18.558
(chuckles)

05:19.636 --> 05:23.304
- I was just tryin'
to be a gentleman.

05:24.066 --> 05:26.140
What? Why's that so hard
to believe?

05:26.160 --> 05:28.401
- Occam's razor.

05:28.554 --> 05:31.388
- That what you use
to get all silky smooth?

05:32.224 --> 05:33.832
- It's a philosophical
principle.

05:33.909 --> 05:37.243
It means the simplest
explanation is usually
the right one.

05:37.320 --> 05:38.395
- Hmm.

05:38.655 --> 05:40.413
- I've had enough experience
with boys like you.

05:40.490 --> 05:42.399
Supposedly straight men
with a weakness

05:42.417 --> 05:45.093
for girls
with a little somethin' extra?

05:48.349 --> 05:51.575
- Did you uh, get rid of it?

05:51.593 --> 05:55.187
- First of all, that is not
something you ask
a lady you just met.

05:55.263 --> 05:57.080
- Sorry, you're right.
(laughs)

05:57.099 --> 05:59.841
Uh, I had a few.
- Mm-hmm.

05:59.918 --> 06:01.193
- And no.

06:01.344 --> 06:03.269
I like mine just fine.

06:03.364 --> 06:05.530
(laughs)

06:11.372 --> 06:12.871
Thanks.

06:13.022 --> 06:15.999
- Uh, you know, stay safe.

06:24.276 --> 06:27.219
- All right, one drink.
(chuckles)

06:27.295 --> 06:29.112
One.

06:29.114 --> 06:34.059
- Uh, look, no disrespect
but I'm not...

06:34.895 --> 06:37.954
I don't, uh...

06:37.956 --> 06:40.065
- Finish your sentences?

06:42.461 --> 06:45.362
(door creaking, keys rattling)

06:49.392 --> 06:51.493
(soft music)

06:56.992 --> 06:59.084
(grunts)

07:15.269 --> 07:17.477
(sighs)

07:42.463 --> 07:44.111
(door creaking, banging)

07:44.131 --> 07:45.689
- Oh, you pee like a man today?

07:45.707 --> 07:48.041
- You can't let him in here!
He's the dude that...

07:48.193 --> 07:50.510
- This is for my brother.
(grunts)

07:52.622 --> 07:54.789
I should have done this
the first time.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.123
You hear me?

07:56.143 --> 07:57.809
(coughing)
- Alright, that's enough.

07:57.961 --> 07:59.385
Hey!
- You hear me?

07:59.462 --> 08:01.295
- Hey, hey.
- Let go of me!

08:01.315 --> 08:03.356
- Come on!
(man spits)

08:03.391 --> 08:06.876
(painful groans, coughing)

08:06.895 --> 08:08.987
Get out of here!

08:09.898 --> 08:11.740
(door closing)

08:13.827 --> 08:17.329
(theme music)

08:29.568 --> 08:33.995
I could say,
"I lost my wedding ring." Right?

08:34.014 --> 08:36.422
Simple past tense.

08:36.499 --> 08:39.834
Maybe I lost it Monday,
and found it on Tuesday.

08:39.853 --> 08:41.411
We don't know.

08:41.413 --> 08:44.189
Or I can use present perfect

08:44.266 --> 08:47.250
if the ring is still missing.

08:47.252 --> 08:51.029
"I have lost my wedding ring."

08:51.590 --> 08:54.607
- That's why you don't
wear yours, teacher?

08:55.735 --> 08:58.111
- Well, Svetlana, I don't have
a wedding ring.

08:58.263 --> 08:59.612
This is hypothetical.

08:59.765 --> 09:02.189
How was your weekend?
You see what's his name?

09:02.267 --> 09:04.876
Finance guy?
- Nah. He flaked again.

09:05.028 --> 09:07.028
I think it's over.
- Awe.

09:07.105 --> 09:08.380
- What about you, though?

09:08.957 --> 09:11.791
- I broke my own rule and fooled
around with a chaser.

09:11.868 --> 09:13.367
- A who?
- You know,

09:13.387 --> 09:15.036
like a guy
with a drag queen fetish.

09:15.113 --> 09:17.113
- Oh.
You meet him at the club?

09:17.132 --> 09:19.616
- Oh God, no.
Total closet case.

09:19.634 --> 09:21.117
Married, even.

09:21.119 --> 09:23.636
- Wait, Kevin!
- I know, I know.

09:24.231 --> 09:25.955
There was just somethin'
about him, okay?

09:25.957 --> 09:27.957
Good Will Hunting vibes.

09:27.959 --> 09:29.884
- Oh, she's in love.

09:29.961 --> 09:33.313
- She is not.
She's a realist.

09:33.465 --> 09:35.615
(TV beeping)

09:40.229 --> 09:42.372
(doorbell ringing)

09:49.831 --> 09:52.090
Yeah.
<i> - Um, Robyn?</i>

09:52.167 --> 09:55.076
It's Jaime from last weekend.

09:55.153 --> 09:58.263
<i> Look, I'm not like</i>

09:58.340 --> 10:00.265
a creep or anything,
I swear.

10:00.342 --> 10:04.661
I just I had your address
saved in my Uber

10:04.679 --> 10:06.830
and I was nearby.

10:06.848 --> 10:08.422
<i>You're probably busy, I'm sorry.</i>

10:08.500 --> 10:10.609
- No, no, it's okay. Just...

10:11.670 --> 10:14.487
could you come back
in like half an hour?

10:18.601 --> 10:19.934
Hi.

10:20.011 --> 10:23.538
- I, uh... I grabbed these.

10:25.350 --> 10:27.292
Thanks.

10:29.987 --> 10:31.946
- Out with your buddies again?

10:31.965 --> 10:35.258
- Uh, yeah, I was.
- Hmm.

10:39.030 --> 10:40.722
- There you go.

10:49.224 --> 10:51.708
It's a nice place.

10:51.726 --> 10:53.543
- Hasn't changed much.

10:54.229 --> 10:56.655
Guess you were
a little distracted.

10:56.806 --> 10:58.615
Last time.

10:59.493 --> 11:01.901
- You by yourself here?

11:01.978 --> 11:03.736
- Just my name on the lease.

11:03.889 --> 11:05.580
- And what name is that?

11:06.858 --> 11:08.625
- Kevin.

11:09.002 --> 11:10.877
- Kevin.

11:10.987 --> 11:13.004
And what's he like?

11:13.990 --> 11:15.748
- Dull.
But he pays the bills.

11:15.901 --> 11:17.634
- Hmm.

11:19.754 --> 11:21.012
(scoffs)

11:21.164 --> 11:23.348
That supposed to be
like a joke or something?

11:24.184 --> 11:26.000
- Yeah, honey,
it's called a pun.

11:26.019 --> 11:29.354
(chuckles)
- I know what a pun is, thanks.

11:29.431 --> 11:32.065
- I bet you do.

11:39.941 --> 11:43.184
So, this is me.

11:43.261 --> 11:46.246
I could use a bit of a heads
up next time.

11:48.041 --> 11:50.625
Or look, Snapchat's easier.

11:52.862 --> 11:56.089
So your wife's not stumbling
on your texts.

11:57.867 --> 12:00.385
Unless it's a husband?

12:00.462 --> 12:02.962
You're lucky, though. One more
week and I would've pawned it.

12:03.114 --> 12:05.706
She notice it missing yet?

12:05.784 --> 12:07.642
- She's dead.

12:09.287 --> 12:11.229
Car accident.
Last year.

12:11.898 --> 12:14.215
- Oh, God.
I'm sorry.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.508
- No, it's okay.
- I didn't mean--

12:15.660 --> 12:18.570
- No, listen, forget it.
Okay? Really.

12:19.239 --> 12:23.575
Truth is, I, I, I...
I really can't be doin' this.

12:25.804 --> 12:27.662
It's not me.

12:28.974 --> 12:31.291
I'll show myself out.

12:33.069 --> 12:35.828
(door creaking, closing)

12:36.739 --> 12:39.983
- I grew up in the Bay area.
Came out east for college.

12:40.001 --> 12:41.742
Never left.
- And you like consulting?

12:41.820 --> 12:43.261
- I do, yeah.

12:43.430 --> 12:46.598
But seriously, though,
I think that teachers are
the real heroes.

12:46.749 --> 12:49.325
What do you do for fun?
- Oh, you know. Usual stuff.

12:49.344 --> 12:52.845
Movies, concerts, masturbate.
(laughs)

12:52.998 --> 12:54.255
I also perform on the weekends.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.940
- Oh, dope.
You a musician?

12:56.092 --> 12:57.442
- I do drag actually.

12:57.519 --> 12:59.110
- Really?

13:00.263 --> 13:03.172
Um, no, I just... I dunno.

13:03.191 --> 13:06.009
I guess I'm not
into the whole fem scene.

13:06.027 --> 13:07.860
- Masc for masc only?

13:08.013 --> 13:10.513
(phone buzzing)

13:10.515 --> 13:12.865
- You know, actually,
I gotta pee.

13:13.018 --> 13:15.043
Take it.

13:20.801 --> 13:22.783
- Hello?
<i> - Hi, Kevin?</i>

13:22.861 --> 13:24.469
<i> Um, it's Jamie.</i>

13:24.546 --> 13:26.620
You'll have to be a little
more specific.

13:26.640 --> 13:29.882
- Ah, I guess,
it was about a month ago.

13:29.959 --> 13:31.458
I came over and...

13:31.478 --> 13:33.219
- And I never heard
from you again.

13:33.371 --> 13:35.371
"'Cause 'this isn't you."

13:35.373 --> 13:39.466
- Yeah, I, uh... I just...

13:39.519 --> 13:40.634
<i> I dunno.</i>

13:40.895 --> 13:43.488
<i> I was out tonight</i>
<i> and I was just wonderin'...</i>

13:44.307 --> 13:46.699
what you were doin' later?

13:49.162 --> 13:51.996
- Lemme call you back.

13:57.896 --> 14:00.255
(soft music)

14:02.676 --> 14:03.991
(sighs)

14:04.010 --> 14:07.345
(TV playing indistinctly)

14:16.189 --> 14:18.565
(doorbell ringing)

14:21.844 --> 14:23.027
- Go home, Jamie.

14:23.104 --> 14:24.345
- Come on. It's me.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.938
- And you're three hours late.

14:26.091 --> 14:27.423
- Yeah, I know.
I got held up.

14:27.425 --> 14:29.759
- Screw you.

14:29.777 --> 14:31.518
- Hey! Hey!

14:32.688 --> 14:34.947
(knocking on door)
What you doin' in there?
Let me in.

14:35.100 --> 14:36.599
Come on. Come on!

14:36.618 --> 14:38.117
- What the hell is
wrong with you?!

14:38.194 --> 14:39.526
You wanna get me evicted?

14:39.546 --> 14:41.362
- You should've let me in
the first time.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.439
- I don't want you here.
I'm done.

14:43.458 --> 14:45.216
I'm done.
- Come on. Don't be like that.

14:45.326 --> 14:48.127
Hey, hey. Come on.
My brother called, all right?

14:48.279 --> 14:49.554
We had a mess with one
of the supply trucks,

14:49.705 --> 14:51.538
I had to go all the way back
to the warehouse.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.950
- What the hell do you think
I do all day, huh?

14:53.968 --> 14:57.470
You think I'm sittin' around
in high whore drag
reclining on a chaise lounge

14:57.622 --> 14:59.288
just waiting for you
to pop by?
- No!

14:59.290 --> 15:01.791
- All of this? Takes work.

15:01.809 --> 15:03.067
And I don't work for free.

15:03.294 --> 15:05.570
- Look.
- You wanna see me,
come to Matterhorn.

15:05.721 --> 15:07.313
- Oh, right.
- Pay for a ticket
like everyone else.

15:07.465 --> 15:09.465
- Sure.
- Buy me a real drink for once.

15:09.467 --> 15:11.242
- You think this is easy
for me, huh?

15:11.319 --> 15:14.395
Do you have any idea
what Matty would say if he knew
where I was right now?

15:14.414 --> 15:16.897
- Who the hell cares, Jamie?!
- I do. I care.

15:16.975 --> 15:18.307
He's the only family I've got.

15:18.326 --> 15:20.627
He raised me
since I was 10 years old.

15:25.984 --> 15:27.908
- Look...

15:27.928 --> 15:30.169
we've had fun, yeah?

15:30.246 --> 15:34.507
But facts are facts.

15:35.251 --> 15:37.285
We both know this ain't real.

15:37.361 --> 15:39.178
So let's cut our losses, yeah?

15:39.330 --> 15:41.522
Before someone gets hurt?

15:43.001 --> 15:44.567
(sighs)

15:57.865 --> 16:01.417
(handcuffs rattling)

16:06.299 --> 16:08.191
- What the hell
happened to your face?

16:08.209 --> 16:11.694
- Nothing.
I tripped.

16:11.696 --> 16:13.471
(door opening)

16:15.700 --> 16:17.475
Just let it go.

18:15.095 --> 18:17.303

18:28.683 --> 18:31.016
You ever sing?
In your shows?

18:31.093 --> 18:34.170
- Oh, God, no.
Lip-sync only.

18:34.188 --> 18:36.989
- You got such
a nice voice though.

18:38.009 --> 18:39.617
- You're sweet.

18:39.694 --> 18:42.078
I could never.

18:42.847 --> 18:44.513
- Hmm.

18:45.625 --> 18:50.044
I didn't think
you were scared of anything.
(Kevin chuckles softly)

18:51.205 --> 18:54.090
= I like to keep it separate,
I guess.

18:55.193 --> 18:57.860
Onstage I get to be
someone else.

18:57.953 --> 19:00.263
- Hmm...
- That's the fun.

19:02.124 --> 19:03.957
You never tried it?

19:04.035 --> 19:05.292
As a kid?
- What?

19:05.370 --> 19:08.053
- Momma's high heels?
- No.

19:08.206 --> 19:10.055
You don't get it.
Where I'm from...

19:10.208 --> 19:13.359
- You think it was easy
in Alabama?

19:14.821 --> 19:16.988
(chuckles)
- Right.

19:18.658 --> 19:22.809
My dad used to work
for a vendor when we were kids

19:22.887 --> 19:25.145
and shipments would come in

19:25.165 --> 19:27.748
and we would go down
to Haymarket with the truck.

19:28.910 --> 19:31.227
(laughs)

19:31.229 --> 19:36.916
And I used to love
polishing the watermelons,

19:37.068 --> 19:39.418
I know but like...

19:39.570 --> 19:43.014
arranging 'em in the crates
and whatnot.

19:45.426 --> 19:47.760
I remember once

19:47.836 --> 19:50.262
Matty snapped at me

19:50.339 --> 19:53.858
and he's like, "Enough already,"
you know?

19:53.935 --> 19:55.918
"Nobody cares
what they look like.

19:55.920 --> 19:58.237
You look like a queer."

19:59.273 --> 20:02.441
I remember even then,
it was like...

20:03.018 --> 20:06.537
- But I'm not the first, right?

20:08.099 --> 20:10.766
(sighs)

20:10.785 --> 20:11.951
- I dunno.

20:12.103 --> 20:14.620
It just never seemed right,
you know?

20:14.697 --> 20:16.439
I mean...

20:16.441 --> 20:19.884
men, women,

20:20.035 --> 20:22.303
somethin' was always...

20:23.798 --> 20:25.681
wrong.

20:28.119 --> 20:30.394
Not this, you know.

20:33.291 --> 20:35.048
<i> - Words are never perfect.</i>

20:35.068 --> 20:36.734
Even when you're a fluent
speaker.

20:37.086 --> 20:40.571
There are times where
you don't know how to say
the thing you really want.

20:40.723 --> 20:42.889
Don't be afraid to get creative.

20:42.967 --> 20:45.660
Use the words
you do know, right?

20:47.305 --> 20:50.081
- Yesterday, I go to
the grocery.

20:50.308 --> 20:53.142
- Uh-huh.
- Uh, I want to buy a chicken.

20:53.160 --> 20:55.144
- Chicken? Sounds delicious.

20:55.162 --> 20:58.256
- But I can't remember
how to say chicken.

20:58.332 --> 21:00.407
- Uh-huh.
And what did you do?

21:01.594 --> 21:04.244
Bless his heart, he grabs
a carton of eggs, right?

21:04.264 --> 21:06.338
- Uh-huh.
- Goes up to the cashier.

21:06.491 --> 21:08.173
Points at the eggs
and says, "Where's momma?
- What?

21:08.326 --> 21:10.493
- "Where's momma?"
- He did not!

21:10.495 --> 21:12.177
- "Where's momma?"
- The best part... wait, wait.

21:12.330 --> 21:14.330
This poor lady just looks
at him and says,

21:14.348 --> 21:16.107
"Uh, I dunno know sir.
Probably dead?"

21:16.183 --> 21:19.068
- What?
(laughing)

21:23.524 --> 21:24.690
- What?

21:24.933 --> 21:27.676
- Shoot, I just realized
I left my charger at school.

21:27.695 --> 21:30.771
I should probably grab it,
but lunch tomorrow?

21:30.848 --> 21:32.364
- Yeah.
- Okay.

21:32.441 --> 21:33.849
- Muah, Muah.

21:33.868 --> 21:36.335
Bye, boo.
- Bye.

21:45.046 --> 21:48.431
(Jamie and woman
talking indistinctly)

21:51.144 --> 21:52.701
(woman): It's not raining.

21:52.720 --> 21:57.273
- These TV weather guys... they
don't know what they're doing.

22:10.330 --> 22:14.332
- Your receipt is in the bag.
Have a good day.

22:16.394 --> 22:18.085
- Excuse me.

22:20.398 --> 22:22.989
- Hi there.
Need some help?

22:23.067 --> 22:26.159
- Yeah, I was just wondering
if these are all
the sizes you have?

22:26.179 --> 22:27.586
- Uh, which size
are you lookin' for?

22:27.663 --> 22:30.997
Depends on the cut.
I'm usually a 10 or a 12.

22:31.017 --> 22:34.018
- Oh, uh.
- Wow, this one's gorgeous too.

22:34.095 --> 22:35.911
More my color.

22:35.913 --> 22:37.413
What is this, an 8?

22:37.415 --> 22:39.190
- Lemme check in the back, yeah?

22:39.341 --> 22:41.584
My name's Natalie
if you uh, need anything else.

22:41.586 --> 22:46.030
- Actually, if you're not
too busy I could use
an extra pair of eyes?

22:46.699 --> 22:50.183
- Gotta tell you, I lasted
one summer in retail. Barely.

22:50.203 --> 22:51.760
- Oh, come on.
It's not that bad.

22:51.779 --> 22:55.264
- Placating the masses is not
for the faint of heart.

22:55.266 --> 22:57.666
Okay.
Ready or not.

22:58.769 --> 23:00.603
Whaddya think?

23:00.696 --> 23:04.197
- Okay, first of all, screw you
for having better legs than me.
- Oh, you hush.

23:04.275 --> 23:06.199
- You think I'm joking?

23:06.277 --> 23:08.277
- I have eyes, sis.

23:08.295 --> 23:12.631
I know when you're not giving
shop girl realness
you drive the boys crazy.

23:12.783 --> 23:15.726
We'll go clubbin' together
sometime. You'll see.

23:15.803 --> 23:19.546
- I think that my, uh...
clubbing days are over.

23:19.624 --> 23:22.048
- He can't survive
one night without you?

23:22.068 --> 23:24.476
- Okay. I know that I'm paid
to say this

23:24.553 --> 23:27.888
but this is really stunning.
- Mm-hmm.

23:27.965 --> 23:29.815
- You been married long?

23:29.967 --> 23:31.575
- Eight years.

23:31.652 --> 23:34.412
- Wow. Kids?

23:36.231 --> 23:37.498
But you want them?

23:39.401 --> 23:41.160
I'm so sorry, that's none
of my business.

23:41.236 --> 23:43.337
I didn't mean--
- You're fine.

23:44.590 --> 23:48.651
Um... so I actually need
to start closing up.

23:48.744 --> 23:52.263
But do you think that you wanna
take one of the dresses?

23:52.490 --> 23:54.932
- You work on commission, right?

23:55.083 --> 23:56.825
I'll take both.

23:56.844 --> 23:58.919
- Sir, really, you...
you don't need to do that.

23:58.938 --> 24:01.730
- They're both gorgeous!
And I'm greedy.

24:03.334 --> 24:05.276
You goin' straight home now?

24:05.352 --> 24:07.186
I'm not tryin'
to get in your pants.

24:07.338 --> 24:08.187
Trust.

24:08.339 --> 24:09.947
- You're too much,
you know that?

24:10.098 --> 24:12.450
Guilty as charged.

24:14.695 --> 24:16.345
- You like champagne?

24:16.363 --> 24:18.747
- Oh, don't tell me
we're the good time.

24:19.867 --> 24:22.293
- Thank you, have a great night.

24:26.132 --> 24:29.449
We can't afford IVF,
so I just Google.

24:29.469 --> 24:32.027
Herbal stuff. Supplements.
You go down a rabbit hole.

24:32.029 --> 24:33.286
- And no luck?

24:33.380 --> 24:35.380
- I got pregnant again
last summer.

24:35.533 --> 24:39.143
Three weeks later, giant SUV
plows into me on the Mass pike.

24:39.294 --> 24:41.645
- Oh, God.
- Yeah.

24:41.797 --> 24:44.482
- The worst part is I can tell
my husband's mad
I'm not over it.

24:44.633 --> 24:47.059
- How could you be?
- I dunno know. It's just ...

24:47.211 --> 24:50.971
it's been rough lately.
Everything's an argument.

24:51.065 --> 24:53.048
He's hammered
every chance he gets.

24:53.067 --> 24:54.216
- So sorry.

24:54.218 --> 24:55.976
- He's got... trauma.

24:56.053 --> 24:57.811
From when he was a kid.

24:57.888 --> 24:59.738
Some queer sicko.

24:59.890 --> 25:02.241
I'm not anti-gay,
I just...

25:02.393 --> 25:04.743
I'm anti pervert, you know?
- He was abused?

25:04.820 --> 25:08.506
- We're married three years
before I even got him to admit
there was somethin'.

25:09.342 --> 25:12.343
Oh, look at me,
Debbie Downer over here.

25:12.494 --> 25:14.403
What about you?

25:14.405 --> 25:16.088
Do you have anybody special
in your life?

25:16.240 --> 25:19.591
- Nah.
I thought so maybe.

25:20.019 --> 25:22.002
But the guy turned out
to be married.

25:22.079 --> 25:23.412
- Hmm, classic.

25:23.430 --> 25:25.080
- Even told me his wife
was dead.

25:25.082 --> 25:26.857
- No. For real?

25:27.009 --> 25:28.934
God...
Men are trash.

25:29.028 --> 25:31.511
You know?
No offence but...

25:31.531 --> 25:33.364
- Hey, facts are facts.

25:33.440 --> 25:36.775
So were there any, um... clues?

25:36.852 --> 25:39.036
- Oh, plenty.

25:39.187 --> 25:40.946
Should've been obvious.

25:41.098 --> 25:43.932
I just didn't wanna see it.
You know?

25:43.951 --> 25:46.252
- Yeah, I know.

25:47.621 --> 25:50.631
(Tv playing indistinctly,
door rattling)

25:53.110 --> 25:55.627
(door closing)

25:55.704 --> 25:57.429
- Hey.

25:58.465 --> 26:01.725
- Long day?
-Yeah, it was all right.

26:03.287 --> 26:05.646
(beer bottlecap tinkling)

26:11.720 --> 26:13.362
Did you eat yet?

26:14.131 --> 26:16.490
(turns off the TV)

26:19.303 --> 26:21.136
- I wanna try counselling again.

26:21.155 --> 26:22.746
- Okay, can we not do this now?
Please.

26:22.898 --> 26:24.915
- It doesn't have to be
Dr. Bristol.
It can be someone you like.

26:25.067 --> 26:29.069
- Like I said before, if you
wanna go get your head shrunk,
nobody's stopping you.

26:29.146 --> 26:31.313
But I don't need
some smartass pervert

26:31.332 --> 26:32.664
asking me a bunch
of sick questions.

26:32.741 --> 26:35.317
- He's not a pervert, Jamie.
He's just doin' his job.

26:35.410 --> 26:37.911
- I just walked in the door,
you're already pickin' a fight?

26:37.930 --> 26:41.247
- Well, I'd rather talk about
this now while you can still
string a sentence together.

26:41.267 --> 26:43.842
- It's one beer, all right?!
You know what?

26:43.994 --> 26:45.510
(glass breaking)

26:45.663 --> 26:47.396
You happy?!

27:01.621 --> 27:03.454
I'm sorry.

27:06.867 --> 27:08.851
(sighs)

27:08.869 --> 27:11.128
I haven't eaten since noon.

27:12.114 --> 27:15.507
I'll think about it, okay?
I will.

27:17.786 --> 27:21.263
How many times I have
to tell you to pack
a freakin' protein bar.

27:22.308 --> 27:25.059
You with low blood sugar:
not sexy.

27:28.706 --> 27:30.147
(Jamie sighs)

27:30.224 --> 27:32.541
You been watchin' Dr. Phil or
somethin'?

27:32.559 --> 27:34.042
- Hm?

27:34.061 --> 27:35.969
- All the therapy talk.

27:36.046 --> 27:37.488
- Oh...

27:38.048 --> 27:39.973
No. I, um...

27:40.475 --> 27:43.402
I just had a moment
with a customer today.

27:43.496 --> 27:46.312
It was sweet actually.
Ended up talkin' to him
for a while.

27:46.332 --> 27:49.500
- Him?
- He was gay, relax.

27:49.727 --> 27:50.893
- Hmm.

27:51.562 --> 27:54.062
- In fact, he was in there
pickin' out a dress.

27:54.081 --> 27:57.007
Point is um,
it got me thinkin'...

27:57.918 --> 27:59.918
we can't keep doin' this.

27:59.995 --> 28:02.429
Same fights, over and over.

28:03.182 --> 28:04.998
You know I love you

28:05.017 --> 28:07.601
but facts are facts.

28:10.856 --> 28:13.482
(soft dramatic music)

28:20.682 --> 28:23.400
<i> - Listen, I know what you did.</i>
<i> And you had no right,</i>
<i> you hear me?</i>

28:23.627 --> 28:26.778
<i> This is not a game.</i>
<i> This is my life.</i>

28:26.855 --> 28:30.265
<i>And what, now you're too afraid</i>
<i>to pick up the damn phone? Huh?</i>

28:30.267 --> 28:33.127
<i> I know where to find you.</i>

28:37.049 --> 28:40.676
(keys clacking softly)

28:44.706 --> 28:47.307
(sighs)

28:56.402 --> 28:57.884
- What the hell?

28:57.903 --> 28:59.294
- You tell me, Jamie.

28:59.313 --> 29:01.646
- You stalked my wife!
- And you told me she was dead.

29:01.799 --> 29:02.906
What kinda sick sociopath.

29:03.075 --> 29:04.816
- Oh, for God's sake,
I didn't know you from Adam!

29:04.893 --> 29:06.559
- Oh, sure.
- You were sittin' there
crackin' jokes,

29:06.579 --> 29:09.321
readin' me like a book.
- Turns out I had you pegged
at the jump.

29:09.415 --> 29:11.397
Just another tragic
closeted queen.

29:11.475 --> 29:12.565
- You know what?

29:12.752 --> 29:14.418
I love Natalie in a way
you could never understand.

29:14.495 --> 29:16.478
- Then grow some balls
and tell her the truth.

29:16.497 --> 29:18.738
Cowardice isn't kind.
- Cowardice? Really?

29:18.758 --> 29:21.149
Four months, this is the first
time I've seen you no makeup.

29:21.243 --> 29:22.742
Why is that, huh?
- What's that got to do with--

29:22.762 --> 29:24.762
- 'Cause you're puttin' on
an act just like everyone else.

29:24.838 --> 29:26.671
Only you think
you're all high and mighty.

29:26.748 --> 29:29.491
Callin' me a coward 'cause
I don't prance around
for a bunch of queers

29:29.493 --> 29:32.418
like some transvestite hooker?
Are you serious?

29:32.438 --> 29:35.981
Some of us have
a little self-respect.

29:36.834 --> 29:38.258
- Who was it, Jamie?

29:38.335 --> 29:40.110
- What?
-Family friend?

29:40.262 --> 29:41.945
Little league coach?

29:42.097 --> 29:44.430
Yeah, she told me.
But you listen to me.

29:44.508 --> 29:47.326
Whatever happened to you
didn't make you gay.

29:48.028 --> 29:49.528
That's not how it works.

29:49.680 --> 29:52.364
So you wanna spend the rest
of your life living a lie,

29:52.516 --> 29:54.440
stick your head in the sand,
be my guest,

29:54.460 --> 29:57.586
but that's the opposite
of self-respect.

30:13.720 --> 30:15.646
(phone ringing)

30:16.515 --> 30:18.649
(deep, trembling breath)

30:18.800 --> 30:21.527
(line ringing)

30:27.993 --> 30:31.578
<i> What do you want?</i>
- I told Natalie.

30:32.665 --> 30:33.980
- What do you mean?

30:33.999 --> 30:37.084
- I mean she knows.
Everything.

30:38.062 --> 30:39.837
- You're serious?

30:39.913 --> 30:41.563
- Mm-hmm.

30:41.565 --> 30:42.914
- Where is she?

30:43.067 --> 30:44.900
<i> - She went to her sister's.</i>

30:45.511 --> 30:47.994
<i>She wants me out by the morning.</i>

30:48.088 --> 30:49.847
Can... can we just
go away together?

30:50.074 --> 30:51.423
<i> Please?</i>

30:51.499 --> 30:54.726
<i>I'll pick you up in the morning,</i>
<i> first thing. 8 am.</i>

30:57.356 --> 30:58.689
Please?

30:58.765 --> 31:00.440
I need you.

31:01.193 --> 31:02.767
- Okay.

31:02.844 --> 31:04.586
- Okay?

31:04.588 --> 31:06.512
- Yeah.

31:06.532 --> 31:08.365
- Okay.

31:22.715 --> 31:25.507
(dramatic music)

31:47.481 --> 31:50.490
- You should eat something.
- Thanks.

31:55.563 --> 31:56.972
(sobbing)

31:56.990 --> 31:58.582
- Hey. Hey.

31:58.733 --> 32:00.400
Listen to me.

32:00.419 --> 32:04.546
It's feelin' like you burned it
all down
and there's nothing left?

32:06.667 --> 32:08.759
That's freedom.

32:14.416 --> 32:16.491
The day Natalie Walsh
was murdered,

32:16.510 --> 32:20.345
you and Jamie arranged to meet
in person at Merrymount Park?

32:20.497 --> 32:23.423
- Yes.
- To discuss what?

32:24.334 --> 32:28.094
- Our relationship, I guess.
I'd found out he was married.

32:28.113 --> 32:29.504
I was upset.

32:29.506 --> 32:34.284
- In fact, you'd stalked
Mrs. Walsh, hadn't you?

32:34.436 --> 32:36.787
You'd shown up
at her place of work.

32:36.863 --> 32:38.697
Tried to befriend her.

32:38.849 --> 32:39.957
You'd become obsessed.

32:40.033 --> 32:41.441
- No.
It wasn't like that.

32:41.460 --> 32:43.961
I told him it was over.
We argued and I left.

32:44.037 --> 32:47.038
- After which, he returned home,

32:47.191 --> 32:49.299
bludgeoned Natalie Walsh
to death

32:49.451 --> 32:52.118
and immediately called you,
again.

32:52.137 --> 32:54.287
Because he needed help
dumping the body.

32:54.364 --> 32:56.289
- No, that's not what he said.
- Really?

32:56.366 --> 32:59.017
Where did you think
you were going?

33:25.896 --> 33:28.821
- My dad used to take us here,

33:28.899 --> 33:30.323
before he died.

33:30.676 --> 33:36.263
Me and Matty, we'd race
each other, swimmin' across.

33:39.926 --> 33:41.501
I brought Natalie once.

33:41.595 --> 33:43.836
It's where I asked her
to marry me.

33:43.856 --> 33:46.064
- You did the right thing.

33:47.359 --> 33:49.434
For both of you.

33:50.103 --> 33:53.363
(Jamie breathes deeply)
I promise.

33:55.868 --> 33:58.351
(sighs)
- I'm not a coward.

33:58.428 --> 34:01.329
- I know.
- I'm not...

34:02.708 --> 34:04.416
You love me?

34:05.786 --> 34:07.961
- Yes.
- No matter what?

34:09.364 --> 34:11.298
- Of course.

34:16.889 --> 34:19.097
- I didn't tell Natalie.

34:19.892 --> 34:22.017
She already knew.

34:23.804 --> 34:25.545
- What?

34:25.564 --> 34:27.180
- After...

34:27.733 --> 34:29.624
we met in the park.

34:29.643 --> 34:32.143
When I got home,
she was waitin' for me.

34:32.296 --> 34:35.405
She'd followed me somehow.
I don't know how but... but

34:35.632 --> 34:37.890
she'd seen us together.

34:37.968 --> 34:39.743
- You mean she...

34:39.894 --> 34:41.894
- Yeah, she already knew.

34:41.914 --> 34:44.730
And she started screamin' at me

34:44.808 --> 34:46.249
and...

34:46.401 --> 34:48.734
tellin' me like how could
I humiliate her like this.

34:48.754 --> 34:50.754
All these years. And...

34:52.424 --> 34:54.574
She was drunk,
it wasn't just me.

34:54.651 --> 34:58.578
And then she was... she was...
callin' me a liar and a pervert.

34:58.655 --> 35:01.431
And she was gonna tell Matty.
And I just...

35:02.750 --> 35:04.726
...I lost it.

35:06.254 --> 35:08.163
I'm so sorry.
- Jamie.

35:08.181 --> 35:09.940
- I'm so sorry.

35:10.016 --> 35:11.650
- What did you do?

35:12.853 --> 35:15.570
(steadying breath)

35:16.857 --> 35:18.356
(exhales)

35:18.508 --> 35:21.025
We're gonna have
to weigh her down.

35:21.178 --> 35:23.328
I can't do it alone.

35:24.197 --> 35:26.272
- You... she's...?

35:26.291 --> 35:27.849
- Yeah.

35:27.851 --> 35:29.584
It'll be okay, though.

35:31.463 --> 35:34.205
- Your fingerprints were found
on the trunk of the car.

35:34.282 --> 35:36.983
Traces of Natalie's blood
on the clothes you were wearing.

35:37.060 --> 35:39.043
How do you explain that?

35:39.787 --> 35:41.304
- Listen, listen.
I've got a record, okay?

35:41.456 --> 35:43.548
A year ago she called
the cops on me.

35:43.642 --> 35:46.050
But I never hit her, I swear,
not once, but just... look!

35:46.127 --> 35:47.702
They're not gonna believe me,
okay?

35:47.721 --> 35:50.538
Hey! Hey! What are you doin'?
No! No! Hey!

35:50.540 --> 35:52.232
No. No!

35:54.878 --> 35:57.879
Where the hell are you goin'?
Hey. You can't just
leave me here.

35:57.881 --> 35:59.881
Please!

35:59.883 --> 36:01.324
You did this too!

36:01.476 --> 36:04.235
You know you did!
It was both of us.

36:04.388 --> 36:08.406
Get back here! Robyn! Come back!

36:08.558 --> 36:10.959
- Hey! Help me!

36:13.172 --> 36:15.172
- One last question.

36:15.323 --> 36:18.175
James Walsh has confessed
to killing his wife.

36:18.251 --> 36:20.402
He's going to prison.

36:20.404 --> 36:22.596
For a very long time.

36:24.832 --> 36:27.166
If you're telling the truth,

36:28.061 --> 36:31.688
if you were completely blameless
in this crime,

36:32.933 --> 36:35.358
why won't he corroborate
your story?

36:36.862 --> 36:38.695
What's he got to lose?

36:46.096 --> 36:47.929
- They're really buying this?

36:47.931 --> 36:49.264
The jury.

36:49.282 --> 36:51.449
- It's hard to say.

36:51.526 --> 36:54.360
The case is largely
circumstantial but...

36:55.029 --> 36:59.507
the brutality of the crime
does make a jury more inclined
to convict.

37:01.294 --> 37:04.054
I can see if a plea deal
is still on the table.

37:04.130 --> 37:06.130
- That means telling the world
a lie.

37:06.207 --> 37:08.975
It might be easier
but that doesn't make it right.

37:10.729 --> 37:13.271
Pff...
- Stop.

37:17.218 --> 37:19.736
- How much longer
'til we're back?

37:21.131 --> 37:22.722
- About twenty minutes.

37:22.799 --> 37:24.699
- Can you buy me an hour?

37:37.739 --> 37:39.631
(door opening)

37:42.335 --> 37:45.595
(pop music)
(crowd whispering)

37:48.916 --> 37:50.416
(Robyn): Thank you, sweetheart.

37:50.435 --> 37:51.935
(crowd talking indistinctly)
(gavel banging)

37:51.937 --> 37:53.419
- Order. Order!

37:53.497 --> 37:55.105
Come to order.

37:55.181 --> 37:57.524
That's enough!

37:58.092 --> 37:59.734
Order please.

38:01.262 --> 38:03.738
Uh, redirect, Your Honor?

38:04.691 --> 38:05.782
(clears throat)

38:05.859 --> 38:07.450
To avoid confusion,

38:07.769 --> 38:14.106
let the record show
that this is in fact
the defendant, Kevin Milstead.

38:14.126 --> 38:16.200
Mr. Milstead,

38:16.353 --> 38:19.687
is there a reason why you're
dressed the way you are today?

38:19.689 --> 38:21.356
- Yes.

38:21.358 --> 38:23.466
And not because
it's comfortable.

38:24.194 --> 38:26.428
People pay good money
to see me like this.

38:27.455 --> 38:29.288
I usually don't do it for free.

38:29.366 --> 38:32.309
But I made an exception
the day I was arrested.

38:33.795 --> 38:35.887
The club is one thing.

38:35.963 --> 38:38.064
But out in public?

38:39.467 --> 38:41.225
Broad daylight?

38:42.321 --> 38:45.063
I go out like this
and it causes a bit of a stir,

38:45.157 --> 38:47.382
as you all just witnessed.

38:47.826 --> 38:49.642
So here's my question.

38:50.236 --> 38:54.480
If I'm getting into a car
and I know there's a body
in the trunk,

38:54.499 --> 38:58.001
do you really think I'm looking
for extra attention?

38:58.837 --> 39:01.729
I was wearing nails like these.

39:01.731 --> 39:03.064
Acrylic.

39:03.083 --> 39:05.425
Custom-made.

39:06.086 --> 39:08.261
Not cheap.

39:08.847 --> 39:11.056
And not practical.

39:11.833 --> 39:13.350
So here's my question:

39:14.411 --> 39:18.079
are these the nails you wear
if you're planning to drag
a body from the trunk of a car

39:18.098 --> 39:20.565
and dump it in the middle
of a lake?

39:22.194 --> 39:24.510
I was wearing heels like these.

39:24.588 --> 39:27.197
They go for half a grand
at least.

39:27.348 --> 39:31.034
And let me tell you,
leather's hard to clean.

39:31.185 --> 39:33.185
So here's my question:

39:33.263 --> 39:36.280
whatever you think of my getup,

39:36.357 --> 39:39.358
is this really
what I would have worn

39:39.360 --> 39:42.462
if I had any idea
what Jamie had in mind?

39:44.049 --> 39:46.031
And speaking of Jamie.

39:46.626 --> 39:49.777
You asked why he wouldn't
corroborate my story?

39:49.796 --> 39:52.037
I'll tell you why.

39:52.115 --> 39:53.973
Shame.

39:55.135 --> 39:57.543
And not for what he did.
No.

39:58.379 --> 40:01.305
He's admitted to killing
his wife, sure,

40:01.382 --> 40:04.216
but he wants the world to think
he only did it

40:04.294 --> 40:06.886
'cause some freak in a wig
got in his head.

40:06.963 --> 40:08.905
Manipulated him.

40:09.132 --> 40:11.315
Twisted his mind.

40:12.059 --> 40:14.494
Hell, he might even
believe that.

40:16.230 --> 40:19.565
He hates me
'cause he hates himself.

40:20.477 --> 40:23.628
He'd rather take me down
with him than admit the truth.

40:25.257 --> 40:27.674
He did this on his own,

40:28.835 --> 40:31.761
after spending his life...

40:31.838 --> 40:33.596
hiding.

40:33.673 --> 40:35.974
Running scared.

40:37.010 --> 40:40.395
Can't expect him
to grow a pair now.

40:41.998 --> 40:44.315
Not for my sake.

40:48.171 --> 40:52.532
Facts are facts.

40:56.621 --> 40:59.514
On the charge of conspiracy
to murder,

40:59.532 --> 41:04.327
we find the defendant,
Kevin Milstead, not guilty.

41:04.403 --> 41:07.797
On the charge of
accessory after the fact,

41:07.799 --> 41:13.285
we find the defendant,
Kevin Milstead, not guilty.
(friends exclaiming happily)

41:13.305 --> 41:16.047
On the charge of obstruction
of justice,

41:16.199 --> 41:20.643
we find the defendant,
Kevin Milstead, not guilty.

41:20.795 --> 41:22.687
(cheering)

41:35.068 --> 41:37.235
All right, kids,

41:37.311 --> 41:40.580
I'ma try somethin'
a little different tonight.

41:42.167 --> 41:47.962
