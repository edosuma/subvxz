05:57.591 --> 05:59.391
Right, treasure?

05:59.430 --> 06:03.920
What did I do? I ... did the usual, you know.

06:03.958 --> 06:06.375
Followed around the camera.

06:06.413 --> 06:08.600
"Why did you do that, Milo?"

06:08.639 --> 06:10.442
I don't...

06:12.245 --> 06:13.396
know.

06:17.540 --> 06:18.961
HAPPY RETIREMENT - Hi, Frank. I'm gonna miss...

06:18.999 --> 06:20.533
GOOD-BYE, FRANK  - Sometimes a tragedy is required to ...

06:20.571 --> 06:23.793
Barbara, would you wanna have a testimony on Frank?

06:25.173 --> 06:27.168
Hey, Sara. Hey.

06:27.208 --> 06:31.160
Uh, apparently the guy who's replacing Frank is some douche bag.

06:31.197 --> 06:32.269

06:47.196 --> 06:49.112
Hey, Milo, let's go. We might be late.

06:49.151 --> 06:51.031
Yeah, coming.

06:51.069 --> 06:53.449
Guy just bothers you because you don't know him

06:53.526 --> 06:55.713
and you're suspicious of everything you don't know.

06:55.750 --> 06:58.629
No, he just brings all the way out here with no prep whatsoever.

06:58.665 --> 06:59.625
Who does that?

06:59.665 --> 07:02.081
Guy comes to Columbia from Boston.

07:02.120 --> 07:03.079
Yeah.

07:03.117 --> 07:04.997
Well, its not exactly a lateral move.

07:05.035 --> 07:07.567
- I don't know. Perhaps he moved by the family.  - Has a lot of fun?

07:07.607 --> 07:08.911
He is already arrived in time, it's perfect.

07:08.949 --> 07:10.752
- Yes, you're professionals. - Yes, that's right. Good job.

07:10.790 --> 07:13.358

07:13.396 --> 07:16.007

07:16.045 --> 07:17.271
Everything?

07:17.310 --> 07:20.112
I'll just drive the van  through in front into the house.

07:20.151 --> 07:21.494
MORTGAGE EXECUTED  - This is great because it is gonna be a story

07:21.531 --> 07:23.411
it can really sink into your soul, you know it.

07:23.449 --> 07:24.677
Some people actually benefit from.

07:24.716 --> 07:25.869
- It's, it's actually kind of new ... - I know.

07:25.906 --> 07:27.326
A fresh take, uh, look, so ...

07:27.362 --> 07:28.629
- Smart. - Wanna try one?

07:28.668 --> 07:30.471

- Alright. Milo? - Yeah?

07:34.115 --> 07:35.495
- Then? - Yeah, you much out there.

07:35.533 --> 07:37.490
Well, I ran a trash of crew.

07:37.528 --> 07:39.639
When a folk old abandoned his house,

07:39.677 --> 07:42.016
so we come in and clean the place up.

07:42.057 --> 07:44.129
We started off cleaning the dusted areas

07:44.168 --> 07:45.970
and this switch over it when, uh ...

07:46.047 --> 07:48.004
market went down and the bank started to call us.

07:48.043 --> 07:52.567
It just gonna be obsessed Mr Day take a stop of, uh, what damage there isn't

07:52.607 --> 07:54.870
and see if there is some valuables we got to move

07:54.908 --> 07:56.903
to keep the place from being loaded.

07:56.980 --> 07:59.627
- Oh, does that happen once?  - Yes, it does.

07:59.665 --> 08:02.540
Michael Tobler.

08:02.619 --> 08:04.499
Let's see what's behind the door number one.

08:07.071 --> 08:10.139
Hello? Is anybody home?

08:10.177 --> 08:13.132
Why do I feel like this is going to suck?

08:15.358 --> 08:16.853
Jesus.

08:16.891 --> 08:18.004
Suck it.

08:18.043 --> 08:19.922
One of the person's job is whenever the homos live behind, we got the key.

08:19.997 --> 08:21.764
We stay with what they have left.

08:21.802 --> 08:24.295
You never know what you gonna find through the front door.

08:24.334 --> 08:26.559
It might be toxic mold growing on the wall.

08:26.596 --> 08:28.709
It might be completely disaster area of

08:28.786 --> 08:31.891
...squatters who settled of on the floors. You would never know.

08:34.308 --> 08:36.308

09:01.125 --> 09:04.461
They put out the stuff and just cement down the white toilet.

09:04.503 --> 09:05.961
- And then...  - That's so bad.

09:05.999 --> 09:07.993
They ripped the wiring out of the walls.

09:08.029 --> 09:08.990
- Why do it? - Oh no.

09:09.067 --> 09:12.177
- I don't know. They are very upset about that. - "ripped the wiring out of the walls"?

09:32.009 --> 09:34.735

09:34.774 --> 09:35.774
What is that for?

09:35.807 --> 09:39.644

What the hell?

10:20.731 --> 10:23.418
Are you sure no one's living here?

10:24.532 --> 10:27.331
I had never seen anything like this. The power is still on.

10:29.556 --> 10:31.552
The place is also covered in dust, too.

10:34.889 --> 10:37.802

- What are you doing back here? - I found this ...

13:10.956 --> 13:13.488
- With a bunch of graffiti out here. - I see, I see.

13:13.524 --> 13:15.981
I think there were squatters. What is wrong with you?

13:16.019 --> 13:18.014
I'm sorry. It was a bad thing I do and I didn't do it anyway.

13:19.128 --> 13:20.816
Dude, my heart is beating so fast.

13:20.855 --> 13:22.658
- Its not funny. - I'm sorry. I had to do it.

13:22.696 --> 13:24.615
It is the second time today. You see this?

13:25.533 --> 13:27.032
What is it?

13:31.250 --> 13:32.287
Hey, Leonard.

13:33.206 --> 13:35.471
Oh man, once if this turns out to be a one cellar,

13:35.509 --> 13:37.658
I'll tell you how do I spend my weekend.

13:37.696 --> 13:40.649
- Would you get in there? - Yeah, why don't you check it out?

13:40.690 --> 13:42.070
Did you find anything good?

13:42.109 --> 13:47.173
I don't know. There is a paint and there's a box of DV tapes, maybe camera.

13:47.211 --> 13:48.899
Right there, in the corner. Do you see them?

13:50.701 --> 13:52.966
Wow, great.

13:53.004 --> 13:54.734
- Leonard? Where is Leonard? - Here, right here.

13:54.769 --> 13:57.298
- You mind if we take these video? - It's none of my business.

13:57.336 --> 13:58.719
You're a good man.

13:58.758 --> 14:03.018
Congratulations, today we just struck gold. Those tapes are incredible.

14:03.057 --> 14:04.744
What do you wanna drink? I'll go get the first round.

14:04.783 --> 14:06.547
- I don't ... I don't drink. - You don't? You don't drink?

14:06.586 --> 14:08.120
- No, not drinking. - You're not drinking? At all?

14:08.158 --> 14:09.692
- She does not drink. - Do you want a coffee or something?

14:09.730 --> 14:11.075
- Yeah. - I'll get a coffee.

14:11.113 --> 14:12.186
- I mean, an Irish coffee. - Hey guys.

14:12.225 --> 14:13.567
Cheers.

14:13.605 --> 14:15.945
- Salute. - Cheers.

14:15.984 --> 14:19.206
You know, I don't mean to bring anybody's prie-dieu,

14:19.245 --> 14:22.081
but I just sat in the van for the last 45 minutes

14:22.120 --> 14:26.572
and all I saw was a bunch of very boring ... as family gathers.

14:26.610 --> 14:28.110
- Wrong.  - No, right.

14:28.148 --> 14:29.912
- No, that's totally wrong. - Very boring.

14:29.950 --> 14:33.211
No, that gives us story exactly what it was missing to the context.

14:33.287 --> 14:34.899
Worry about the shooting, the story layer?

14:34.936 --> 14:38.695
Sara, look, you want to be a fantastic poetical one day

14:38.734 --> 14:41.226
and I see that you absolutely have the potential.

14:41.267 --> 14:44.798
But sometimes you got to learn to take what you can get.

14:44.835 --> 14:49.322
And also, Leonard did say whatever that we're behind, we got to keep.

14:50.744 --> 14:54.196
Just that you can't keep something, it means actually you shouldn't.

14:54.231 --> 14:56.268
Look, I do not want to spend the rest of my life<br>in Columbia, do you?

14:56.306 --> 14:57.341
Unprotected ...

15:17.485 --> 15:19.668
- Oh. - This gonna be a lot.

15:21.128 --> 15:22.394
Yeah.

15:24.312 --> 15:26.192
- Chopping broccoli. - Your favorite.

15:26.230 --> 15:29.028
- Oh, broccoli. - Yeah, broccoli.

15:29.067 --> 15:31.408
- I hate broccoli. - You got to love that ...

15:31.447 --> 15:33.750
I got to learn that like you.

15:33.788 --> 15:35.360
It looks like there's moist around the tapes.

15:35.399 --> 15:37.048
Yeah, it's not like it should ...

15:37.086 --> 15:39.427
Cake.

15:39.466 --> 15:43.340
- You can sit outside. - Alright, stop, okay?

15:43.378 --> 15:45.832
Stop it. I know it's a pin in the ass.

15:45.873 --> 15:47.753
And it's a lot of furnish, but we have to go through it.

15:47.791 --> 15:48.903
- But it is a lot. Why...? - It's gonna be...

15:48.942 --> 15:50.782
- It's gonna cut them together well. - Why did we have to do?

15:50.820 --> 15:52.663
Why doesn't Charlie come and watch together with us ...?

15:52.701 --> 15:54.620
- 'Cause that's not his job to do that.  - Yes of course.

15:54.658 --> 15:56.077
- You know that.  - Thank you, mommy.

15:56.115 --> 15:58.341
You know I gets Charlie in your pants, right?

16:01.716 --> 16:03.596
Really?

16:03.634 --> 16:05.284
- Really? - Alright, nevermind.

16:07.586 --> 16:09.046
You really wanna talk about this again?

16:09.082 --> 16:10.196
No, we ... Forget it.

16:10.234 --> 16:11.960
- That was not a good head conversation. - Well, no, you are not given up.

16:11.998 --> 16:13.033
You were absolutely wasted, I know.

16:13.072 --> 16:17.100
But you like totally screw up for a few following weeks after that?

16:17.139 --> 16:19.058
'Cause I seem to remember we last a little longer

16:19.096 --> 16:21.322
a horrible wasted given.

16:21.360 --> 16:25.964
And it was a mistake and we just need to stay friends.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.499
Great. Let me clear. A mistake.

16:27.572 --> 16:29.567
I wouldn't talk about this anymore.

16:34.748 --> 16:36.591
Shit.

17:02.409 --> 17:04.826
Daddy, is that you?

17:05.940 --> 17:07.895
Daddy?

17:12.730 --> 17:14.876
- Are you little tense? - A little bit.

17:14.915 --> 17:17.910
- I've never done this before. - Alright, just relax.

17:17.948 --> 17:20.865
Do you remember the Wittlocke on Hollyluke Road?

17:20.903 --> 17:22.281
Dan and Rose Wittlocke?

17:22.319 --> 17:25.621
We didn't kick the red lights out. They left.

17:25.660 --> 17:27.347
We called them and nobody picked up.

17:27.385 --> 17:28.461
They were  just gone.

17:28.499 --> 17:31.375
So, uh, what has inspired the Wittlocke to leave,

17:31.413 --> 17:34.289
Had nothing to do with us. Nothing.

17:34.367 --> 17:37.130
D &amp; W GROUP MORTGAGE<br>- Hey Milo, what do you think <!-- i-->?

17:37.166 --> 17:39.892
They left. They had just get out of here.

17:39.930 --> 17:41.194
Milo?

17:41.232 --> 17:42.807
- Yeah? - New game plan, man.

17:42.846 --> 17:44.496
Can you give me a flavor  and look up these tapes?

17:44.535 --> 17:48.755
Check discover every hour you can and find it  any inside of the word where the Wittlockes went.

17:48.791 --> 17:52.666
Yeah, that's cool. Alright I just pack up all by myself and I see you guys in some point.

18:02.604 --> 18:04.059
Can you give me sound check with it?

18:04.136 --> 18:05.711
- I can't ... I can't hear you. - You can't hear me?

18:05.750 --> 18:08.549
I can't hear anything.

18:08.587 --> 18:09.894
- The microphone was not on. - Was it off?

18:09.932 --> 18:10.971
It was totally off.

18:11.007 --> 18:12.078
- Good job. - I am professional.

18:12.117 --> 18:14.153
It began as the story with a family ...

18:14.268 --> 18:16.184
driven from the home by Foreclosure

18:16.261 --> 18:19.406
but recent development has shown it to be much more than that.

18:19.444 --> 18:21.711
They were barbeque on the beach.

18:21.749 --> 18:24.701
Dan Rose, Tara, Jeremy.

18:24.740 --> 18:26.502
Wayne noticed it.

18:28.153 --> 18:29.652
Jeremy was gone.

18:31.031 --> 18:33.565
What happened to him?

18:33.604 --> 18:36.442
He went for a swim and hit by a boat.

18:36.480 --> 18:39.625
Dan got a little bit strange after the accident.

18:39.701 --> 18:41.467
I mean, who wouldn't?

18:41.505 --> 18:45.419
He just always had that ... that camera with him.

18:45.457 --> 18:47.798
Uh, I mean, he had it before,

18:47.836 --> 18:50.137
but he would use it for birthday parties...

18:50.213 --> 18:52.288
or school recitals things like that.<br>

18:52.326 --> 18:55.355
I went for a jog and I saw him in the backyard,

18:55.394 --> 18:57.656
just staring into the woods,

18:57.694 --> 19:00.382
just pointing the camera at nothing.

19:00.421 --> 19:04.218
So, did you get any calls regarding Dan Wittlocke or his wife's pryer

19:04.256 --> 19:05.673
through their disappearance?

19:05.711 --> 19:09.164
Yeah, I got a series calls from Dan

19:09.203 --> 19:12.352
claim there were some stalker in the woods outside of his home.

19:12.390 --> 19:14.192
I never saw anything.

19:14.230 --> 19:17.069
Dan? He did not hear in that.

19:17.107 --> 19:18.566
He began to wag and raving,

19:18.605 --> 19:22.134
and insisting there was a guy living in the trees on his property.

19:22.172 --> 19:25.932
If you ask me, the guy playing with the full deck there.

19:25.970 --> 19:27.082
Oops, sorry, I moved my hands.

19:27.118 --> 19:28.655
- No, that's okay. - Okay, that's alright.

19:28.693 --> 19:31.607
- That was pretty good. - A lot of we did that.

19:31.646 --> 19:34.796
If you ask me, the guy wouldn't play with the full deck there.

19:34.834 --> 19:36.329
That's great, it's a great one.

19:46.266 --> 19:47.875
Obsessive.

19:51.443 --> 19:53.018
- Hey. - Hey.

19:53.056 --> 19:54.780
- What're you doing? - Hey, uh...

19:54.819 --> 19:59.423
- Where's the rest of your team? - They'll come back along in five minutes.

19:59.461 --> 20:00.883
Ah, well. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:00.921 --> 20:02.300
Can you see the difference ...?

20:02.339 --> 20:03.721
Does it strikes you as odd?

20:03.759 --> 20:05.332
Yeah, but can you see the...

20:11.278 --> 20:12.851
Here we go.

20:15.460 --> 20:18.145
Alright never mind. Yep, we are good ...

20:18.184 --> 20:19.144
she's not.

20:19.182 --> 20:20.410
This is the fifth call I get.

20:20.448 --> 20:21.866
Barbara, hello.

20:21.904 --> 20:22.942
Yeah.

20:22.980 --> 20:24.746
I ... No, no, we clear this duty

20:24.786 --> 20:27.393
Remember? We talked about it... Okay. Oh, she's gone.

20:27.431 --> 20:28.467
- That's it. she's gone. - She hang up?

20:28.502 --> 20:31.382
I feel like a better husband. I feel I should go on Oprah.

20:31.421 --> 20:36.329
Did you survive two years at the affiliated Boston and you are stressed out here?

20:36.368 --> 20:38.979
Well, I... I got to kicked off Boston.

20:39.017 --> 20:39.938
What?

20:39.976 --> 20:42.546
I got to show you guys something. I got to show you something right now.

20:42.584 --> 20:44.040
Charlie, grab the camera.

20:44.079 --> 20:45.461
- Alright, as if. - What are you...?

20:45.500 --> 20:48.108
Two seconds, I got a whole bunch of stuff to show you guys.

20:48.144 --> 20:49.836
I'll look at it. Come on.

20:49.875 --> 20:50.945
Watch.

20:50.986 --> 20:53.096
Alright, come here.

20:53.134 --> 20:55.588
Come here, girl. Alright.

20:55.625 --> 20:58.201
Good job.

20:58.237 --> 21:00.845
- Alright, birthday girl. - Okay, Tara.

21:00.884 --> 21:02.035
- Just like I showed you. - Let me get this.

21:02.073 --> 21:04.030
- Got hairs on your face too. - Milo, seriously,

21:04.067 --> 21:05.144
What is the point of this?

21:05.182 --> 21:09.057
Just be patient, okay? Just watch.

21:09.095 --> 21:11.626
- Alright, let me spin you. - Not much too dizzy.

21:11.664 --> 21:13.891
Turn you around.

21:13.930 --> 21:15.692
What happened to the sound?

21:15.730 --> 21:18.147
No idea, but it happens on a bunch of these tapes.

21:18.185 --> 21:20.221
There. You see that? You see that?

21:20.259 --> 21:24.171
See what, Milo?

21:24.209 --> 21:26.281
Birthday girl's gonna be defeat.

21:26.319 --> 21:28.392
You see? There ... Look, there's somebody standing<br>back there by the trees.

21:28.431 --> 21:30.385
- Look. - There. Yeah, there.

21:31.346 --> 21:33.147
Looks like a guy in suit.

21:35.028 --> 21:37.444
Hold on. Alright, just listen.

21:38.403 --> 21:40.131
Rose, I'm telling you.

21:40.169 --> 21:43.700
I look through the camera, he there. I look up, he's not there.

21:43.738 --> 21:46.000
I'm not lying. I don't know how's the put.

21:46.038 --> 21:49.031
Right, because you can only see him through the camera...

21:49.069 --> 21:52.601
I'm not crazy, you've seen it. I don't know how else to...

22:00.617 --> 22:02.268
Wait, what is that? Look.

22:04.376 --> 22:06.488
Right there.

22:06.526 --> 22:07.675
- What is that?  - I didn't see it this one.

22:07.752 --> 22:08.752
I didn't see it.

22:08.788 --> 22:10.440
Is that it?

22:11.627 --> 22:14.429
Should we had to stop rewind and show it this tape to the police? I don't understand.

22:14.468 --> 22:17.115
Maybe he tried to and they were just tired enough of them.

22:18.267 --> 22:22.140
In the 60s there was that serial killer, do you remember?

22:22.178 --> 22:24.019
- What was his name?  - Zodiac.

22:24.057 --> 22:26.476
- Yeah.  - I used to make entire, you know, uh, code messages

22:26.897 --> 22:28.853
and the press to the police station.

22:28.892 --> 22:30.348
- So yeah, one of the most of them was actually...  - Oh yeah.

22:30.387 --> 22:32.307
- with this little cross over it.  - Yeah.

22:32.346 --> 22:35.951
So ... I don't know. I mean I guess that  this guy was not that imaginative.

22:35.990 --> 22:39.212
You can always return an X. It is a similar symbol.

22:39.250 --> 22:42.243
- This guy... is a serial killer?  - It could be.

22:42.281 --> 22:44.200
You know, we just found knives clean  and blood in the kitchen.

22:44.277 --> 22:46.384
That thing is that the one trade most serial killer is, that

22:46.424 --> 22:49.035
they are somebody for a while  and then they choose them.

22:49.073 --> 22:51.989
You know, and if this guy keeps popping up for the kids birthday

22:52.027 --> 22:54.444
in the woods in the backyard, I guess this is ridiculous thing to say.

22:54.482 --> 22:57.971
And in fact I have a friend in the Bureau in Boston.

22:58.010 --> 22:59.810
Let me see if I still have his numbers. Hang on.

23:01.309 --> 23:03.613
Yep. I'll giving a call, to see if something is ringing the bell.

23:10.249 --> 23:12.130
Are you okay?

23:12.166 --> 23:16.656
Hey, is Barbara pissed with us or that just your face looks like this all the time?

23:16.695 --> 23:18.038
- Hello, Barbara. - Hey.

23:18.076 --> 23:19.458
Oh yeah?

23:19.497 --> 23:21.606
Two hours late.

23:21.644 --> 23:24.406
Yeah, well, it's a lot difficult working on two stories.

23:24.444 --> 23:25.865
- Oh, really? - Yeah.

23:25.903 --> 23:28.510
- That's the problem. - Well, it doesn't have to be a problem.

23:28.548 --> 23:30.507
Yeah, you know what? I think we need to get inside and talk.

23:32.576 --> 23:34.957
Alright, we... I mean, look, there's no reason we can't do

23:34.993 --> 23:37.144
- Both this story. - Be my guest. Be my guest.

23:37.182 --> 23:38.756
- Come on, Milo. Let's go. - Me too?

23:38.794 --> 23:40.557
- Yeah.  - Really?

23:43.356 --> 23:47.117
Well, I can't believe she pulled this story. That's, that's bullshit.

23:47.156 --> 23:48.615
- I don't know how she runs that place.  - Sara,

23:48.653 --> 23:52.220
Remember the guy, uh, from Atlanta, the rare teeth?

23:52.258 --> 23:53.983
- Yeah. - Wait, who is he?

23:54.021 --> 23:55.058
- This dude came from... - Yeah.

23:55.097 --> 23:59.893
A months ago. We helped him out and he kinda owe us a favor.

23:59.931 --> 24:01.967
Look, to be honest, I think this can go in national.

24:02.006 --> 24:04.652
So if you think you got enough footage, then buy on me. Just keep ...

24:04.691 --> 24:06.760
Up here, guys.

24:06.797 --> 24:09.790
Hey, Marty?

24:09.829 --> 24:12.056
Marty. Marty, out.

24:12.094 --> 24:14.740
Out. Now.

24:14.778 --> 24:16.044
- God.    - Is this your dog?

24:16.083 --> 24:17.656
He does not understand anything I say.

24:17.694 --> 24:19.268
You know, that's everything on the van.

24:19.307 --> 24:21.529
Okay.

24:23.413 --> 24:25.251
- At least we have this. - Yeah.

24:25.290 --> 24:27.076
- That's a good set up, man. - Yeah, thanks.

24:27.111 --> 24:28.861
We should've start this from decade ago.

24:28.897 --> 24:30.777
Yeah, who needs sleep or whatever?

24:31.698 --> 24:33.615
Uh, so that's... That's everything right here.

24:33.653 --> 24:36.914
Just try not to turn into zombie while you going through all this stuff, alright?

24:36.953 --> 24:39.101
- Alright. I will try my best. - You're in.

24:39.140 --> 24:40.634
Call me in the morning and let me know.

24:40.673 --> 24:42.861
Yeah, I will spend a few hours tonight and I'll tell you how it went.

24:42.900 --> 24:44.817
- Okay. - Yes.

24:44.855 --> 24:46.892
- All right, Milo. - Right, just get some sleep.

24:46.929 --> 24:48.884
We'll take care of Barbara.

24:48.923 --> 24:53.989
These are hieroglyphics, and right over here ... These are some pyramids.

24:55.981 --> 24:58.438
He following the daughter too?

25:06.150 --> 25:08.567
Hey, Jesus! No, no!

25:08.605 --> 25:10.905
No, no. Marty, no.

25:12.594 --> 25:13.709
Out.

25:18.539 --> 25:20.573
Rose, come here. Come here.

25:20.612 --> 25:22.567
Come on.

25:22.605 --> 25:25.217
- Where? - Come. Out there, under the tree.

25:25.255 --> 25:27.518
Look, right there. Right there.

25:27.556 --> 25:29.704
Honey, there's nobody out there.

25:29.742 --> 25:31.317
Here, look through the camera.

25:33.272 --> 25:36.037
Oh my God. That's him?

25:36.075 --> 25:39.143
Still there, right? I mean, you see him.

25:39.182 --> 25:41.060
You see?

25:41.101 --> 25:44.435
Give me the camera. Shit.

25:44.473 --> 25:46.624
- He's gone. - What the hell is going on?

25:54.911 --> 25:57.096
I don't know, Marty.

25:57.289 --> 25:59.284
I don't what's going on,

25:59.323 --> 26:05.576
except that I am not gonna not watch  anymore of those goddamn tapes, you feel me?

26:05.614 --> 26:07.683
Do you? You understand? No more.

26:07.721 --> 26:10.103
Not for me. No sir.

26:11.521 --> 26:13.403
Oh goddammit.

26:14.897 --> 26:16.625
Okay.

26:21.115 --> 26:23.452
Where...?

26:26.140 --> 26:28.211
No, Marty.

26:30.781 --> 26:33.237
Stay. Stay in the room, Marty.

26:37.037 --> 26:39.336
Marty, stay in the room.

26:44.403 --> 26:45.553
I've lost.

26:45.589 --> 26:50.192
I've lost it. Thank you, Dan Wittlocke.

26:51.229 --> 26:52.803
Okay.

26:53.800 --> 26:58.903
I'm now officially stuck in the house with my camera.

27:17.509 --> 27:18.892
Hello?

27:58.942 --> 28:01.166
Hello, Milo. How are you?

28:01.204 --> 28:03.432
I'm good. And you?

28:24.035 --> 28:26.105
You know what? Don't check the closet.

28:26.143 --> 28:28.217
It's just jackets in your closet, Milo.

28:28.255 --> 28:30.326
No need to freak out yourself, okay?

28:30.365 --> 28:32.358
Alright.

28:44.558 --> 28:47.092
Marty! Goddammit!

28:47.130 --> 28:49.009
Shit. Jesus.

28:52.769 --> 28:54.608
Oh my God.

29:02.895 --> 29:04.278
Marty?

31:34.054 --> 31:35.971
He did not hear in that.

31:36.009 --> 31:38.237
He began to wag and raving, insisting there was...

31:38.387 --> 31:40.575
a guy living in the trees on his property...

31:49.285 --> 31:51.471
I knew it.

32:01.866 --> 32:03.862
Hi, It's Charlie MacNeel. Leave your message.

32:03.897 --> 32:05.895
Charlie, hey. Hey, it's Milo.

32:05.933 --> 32:08.810
I'm going to the Wittlocke 'cause I want to look for some more tapes.

32:08.848 --> 32:13.798
And I don't know if you're around, but ... I think the guy from the tape is following me

32:13.836 --> 32:15.528
and I ... Call me back if you can.

33:05.976 --> 33:08.084
Come on.

34:20.250 --> 34:22.166
Oh yes.

34:25.735 --> 34:28.344
Goddammit.

34:31.143 --> 34:33.141
Alright. Come on, come on.

34:35.710 --> 34:36.710
Hello?

34:38.050 --> 34:40.927
Oh my God.

34:44.342 --> 34:46.414
Charlie?

34:51.440 --> 34:53.396
Screw this, screw this.

35:16.570 --> 35:17.643
Yes.

35:22.822 --> 35:25.469
Goddammit.

35:49.179 --> 35:51.980
Marty, be good. Stay there. Good.

36:59.043 --> 37:00.844
Goddammit.

37:02.532 --> 37:03.914
Goddammit.

37:11.853 --> 37:12.965
Okay, good.

37:19.755 --> 37:21.829
Oh my God.

37:29.425 --> 37:31.114
Hey, Marty?

37:34.452 --> 37:35.677
Marty?

37:38.518 --> 37:40.206
What the hell you doing?

37:41.626 --> 37:43.891
Marty, what ...?

37:43.929 --> 37:45.614
Marty, there's nothing ...

37:52.981 --> 37:55.398
Asshole, get out of my yard.

38:00.152 --> 38:03.454
Marty, get over here ...

38:06.179 --> 38:08.443
Marty.

38:14.887 --> 38:18.070
Shit. Shit.

38:20.949 --> 38:22.445
Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God.

38:22.483 --> 38:24.708
Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God.

38:31.577 --> 38:33.840
Oh my God. Okay.

38:37.331 --> 38:39.478
Sara?

38:43.085 --> 38:44.965
Godammit.

38:49.489 --> 38:52.371
Hey Sara? Hey, it's Milo.

38:52.409 --> 38:53.829
Sara?

38:53.867 --> 38:55.210
Hey, uh, I'm sorry.

38:55.248 --> 38:57.931
I-I gotta talk to you right now, okay?

38:57.972 --> 38:59.543
- Milo?  - I'm sorry, Sara.

38:59.583 --> 39:01.193
Hey, Sara.

39:01.309 --> 39:02.806
Hey, uh, I'm sorry.

39:02.844 --> 39:04.264
I didn't realize

39:04.300 --> 39:06.833
I didn't realize that, I didn't realize this seconds okay?

39:06.871 --> 39:09.481
You looks like shit. Wait, how did you get in here?

39:09.518 --> 39:14.007
- I used the spare key from the ... plant. The part of plants.  - Jesus.

39:14.047 --> 39:15.119
Listen for to two seconds.

39:15.159 --> 39:16.195
- I'm sorry.   - Jesus.

39:16.233 --> 39:19.764
Okay, I'm sorry. Just listen. Uh, I...

39:19.802 --> 39:24.135
You guys remember the guy, the, the, the ... Uh, Dan Wittlocke who keeps talking in the tapes? The guy?

39:24.170 --> 39:26.014
- Yes Yes Yes. - The guy you can't see,

39:26.052 --> 39:28.239
you know, you make an eye.

39:28.277 --> 39:30.387
Remember he said he can only sees him in the camera?

39:30.425 --> 39:32.650
- Yes.   - I just saw him in my yard.

39:32.690 --> 39:35.338
Okay, okay? Well, well, look. Look at this, look at this.

39:35.378 --> 39:37.179
Look at this. Look.  It's still there. Look at it.

39:37.217 --> 39:39.251
- You see that?  - Oh my God, what did you do with yourself?

39:39.289 --> 39:41.362
I was sleeping and I thought I heard something.

39:41.400 --> 39:43.050
When I woke up, it was just there.

39:43.088 --> 39:44.891
It's like a ... A brand or something.

39:44.929 --> 39:46.271
It's just ...

39:46.309 --> 39:48.074
I just saw the guy in my camera!

39:48.114 --> 39:50.108
Calm down. It's time to leave.

39:50.146 --> 39:51.911
- No, it's not. Charlie.  - You've got to go.

39:51.949 --> 39:53.867
- Sara, listen.  - Calm down.

39:53.905 --> 39:55.824
I don't know what to do. You see this?

39:55.862 --> 39:58.166
Sara, I wouldn't do this to myself!

39:58.204 --> 39:59.739
Charlie, shut up!

39:59.817 --> 40:01.311
- Milo, that's enough!  - Sara, listen. No. No.

40:01.349 --> 40:03.460
No, Charlie! Don't touch my camera, Charlie.

40:03.498 --> 40:05.686
You get out! I don't wanna get physical violence before you leave, do you understand?

40:05.724 --> 40:07.487
Okay. No! Get your hands off me!

40:07.527 --> 40:08.869
Okay, yeah, yeah, I'm calm, I'm calm, I'm calm.

40:08.907 --> 40:10.824
- Listen, I'll go. Charlie, okay? - What?

40:10.862 --> 40:12.014
- I...     - Milo.

40:12.050 --> 40:14.125
Look, I saw you at Chez Figaro and I don't care.

40:14.163 --> 40:16.311
- What the f...? Get out of the house! - God, Charlie!

40:16.349 --> 40:19.036

40:19.074 --> 40:23.103
Sara, I don't want to go home! Sara, please! I don't want to go home!

40:23.141 --> 40:25.672
I don't know what to do!

40:27.322 --> 40:28.742
Goddamn it, Charlie!

40:48.001 --> 40:49.574
911, what is your emergency?

40:49.614 --> 40:51.760
Hi. I...

40:51.797 --> 40:54.023

40:55.172 --> 40:57.514
Sir, are you there?

40:57.592 --> 41:00.891
I need to... report

41:02.885 --> 41:05.418
Are you okay, sir?

41:05.458 --> 41:08.103
- Sir?      - I'm sorry, never, never mind.

41:16.313 --> 41:17.887
Oh shit.

41:26.556 --> 41:28.246

Cash or credit?

41:32.927 --> 41:35.918
Credit, uh, sorry. Hold on.

41:35.956 --> 41:38.603
You got sort of YouTube or something?

41:38.639 --> 41:39.639
Yeah.

42:00.202 --> 42:02.581
Okay.

42:02.619 --> 42:04.346
Okay, I can do this.

42:04.384 --> 42:06.724
I can do this.

42:18.887 --> 42:20.230
Who is it?

42:23.452 --> 42:24.831
Who is it, Marty?

42:30.547 --> 42:32.161
What is it, Marty?

42:41.981 --> 42:43.746
Marty, come here.

42:50.460 --> 42:52.934
Oh God.

42:52.969 --> 42:55.409
H-Hello?

43:02.891 --> 43:05.231
Okay. Okay.

43:08.873 --> 43:11.099
In out...

43:11.139 --> 43:13.210
Oh God...

43:13.248 --> 43:15.242
Your...

43:20.500 --> 43:22.842
Oh, oh, careful. Oh no.

43:22.918 --> 43:24.721
Jesus Christ, Charlie?

43:24.797 --> 43:27.099
What are you doing in my house? You scare the shit out of me, Charlie!

43:27.137 --> 43:28.481
Have you been following her?

43:29.476 --> 43:30.934
How long does this thing going on, Milo?

43:30.974 --> 43:33.851
Is it why you had a problem with me since I came to work?

43:33.889 --> 43:35.001
Charlie, you just can't...

43:35.039 --> 43:37.764
Because you're some sick fantasy with you and Sara got in together?

43:37.802 --> 43:39.376
- You can't just walk into my house ...  - Put the camera down.

43:39.414 --> 43:40.911
Shut up, Milo. Put the camera down.

43:40.949 --> 43:43.864
How long does it going on? Until you know about Chez Figaro, huh?

43:43.902 --> 43:45.016
'Cause you've been watching us?

43:45.054 --> 43:47.202
- No. - I swear to God, how much does it is bullshit, Milo?

43:47.280 --> 43:49.389
Don't start with me or else I lose my temper.

43:49.427 --> 43:52.034
No! I swear to God.

43:52.072 --> 43:54.181
What the fuck is wrong with you?

43:54.221 --> 43:57.483
Charlie, you've been telling us that the, this whole entire Wittlocke story is been going on?

43:57.521 --> 43:59.478
Now you've been spying on her...?

43:59.514 --> 44:02.164
How much it is true and how much it is bullshit?

44:02.202 --> 44:06.039
Because I've been trying, man. I am trying to give the benefit of the doubt!

44:06.077 --> 44:08.342
I swear to God that I will lose my temper!

44:08.380 --> 44:09.530
Sara, listen to me.

44:09.568 --> 44:11.179
Milo. Milo, stop.

44:11.217 --> 44:12.867
Sara, I know, I know, I know.

44:12.905 --> 44:14.632
We're gonna come and talk to him in the morning.

44:14.670 --> 44:16.512
Sara, if you let me show these tapes ...

44:16.547 --> 44:18.277
Milo, shut up! Shut up, Milo!

44:18.315 --> 44:20.579
Look, he's been stalking you for months.

44:20.614 --> 44:22.458
In the grocery store, until you have to work.

44:22.496 --> 44:24.186
- Have footage where ... - Guys, guys.

44:24.224 --> 44:25.721
- Everywhere. - Guys.

44:25.759 --> 44:27.677
- Somebody's gonna pick up the camera now and look at the screen, please.  - That's enough.

44:27.715 --> 44:28.943
That's enough with the pale man.

44:28.981 --> 44:31.704
- Don't touch ... Well, Milo.  - Well, Charlie, Charlie, Charlie.

44:31.744 --> 44:33.547
Okay, fine, just look. Just look. Look, please.

44:33.585 --> 44:35.425
This is ridiculous. Alright, alright.

44:35.463 --> 44:38.646
For the last time, Milo, There is no...

44:38.684 --> 44:40.759
pale man.

44:41.755 --> 44:43.481
Leave the room! Go!

44:53.610 --> 44:55.222
What the hell just happened?

44:55.260 --> 44:57.101
You believe me now?

44:57.139 --> 44:58.405
I'll just keep driving man, okay?

44:58.445 --> 44:59.902
- Where are you trying to take us to?  - What do you mean?

44:59.940 --> 45:02.128
I'll just gotta keep driving until somewhere.

45:02.166 --> 45:03.699
Calm down.

45:03.737 --> 45:05.503
Don't you think he's gonna finds us on the road?

45:05.541 --> 45:06.960
Why does he have to?

45:07.000 --> 45:09.648
- We can't just keep driving, Milo.  - Where are we supposed to go?

45:09.686 --> 45:11.987
We need to, we need to go the cops, okay?

45:12.027 --> 45:14.713
If the cops really believe us ... It is the best idea.

45:14.751 --> 45:17.282
Dan Wittlocke called the cops and looked at what they looked at him.

45:17.320 --> 45:19.123
Yeah, they thought he was crazy.

45:19.161 --> 45:22.190
Yeah, we're not calling the cops like crazy people.

45:25.146 --> 45:27.025
- Hey, you need the GoPro?  - Yeah.

45:28.943 --> 45:30.056
Check this out, guys.

45:30.097 --> 45:32.322
- That's a good idea. - Oh man.

45:35.889 --> 45:37.385
Yeah.

45:38.996 --> 45:41.338
I've got to show you something.

45:41.375 --> 45:42.641
Come here.

45:46.322 --> 45:48.664
Alright man.

45:48.702 --> 45:51.081
- You can bear with me for a second, okay? - Yeah.

45:52.155 --> 45:55.186
I have no idea what the ... what this thing is.

45:55.226 --> 45:58.447
I don't know what it wants, and don't know why chose us or why chose the Wittlockes.

45:59.407 --> 46:02.898
But I think it operates some of uh, some kind of a, like, uh...

46:04.126 --> 46:05.737
Like a pattern. Look.

46:23.882 --> 46:25.302
- Dan? - Yeah.

46:25.340 --> 46:28.025
I see you.

46:29.521 --> 46:33.204

And I have no idea. I have no idea.

47:02.630 --> 47:04.664
I didn't feel it. I just, I just woke up.

47:04.704 --> 47:09.152

49:09.963 --> 49:11.842
Honey, what are you doing?

49:14.721 --> 49:16.179
Rose.

49:17.251 --> 49:18.556
What are you doing?

49:20.360 --> 49:22.125
I was washing up.

49:26.266 --> 49:28.914
- We have to leave. - Okay, okay, okay.

49:28.952 --> 49:30.947
- Okay, okay, yeah, come on.  - Now.

49:32.827 --> 49:34.594
- That's it?  - That's it.

49:34.634 --> 49:36.360
- That's all we have?  - Yeah.

49:36.398 --> 49:37.588
Okay.

49:37.623 --> 49:41.193
So, why does this thing stalks you and then ...?

49:42.958 --> 49:45.143
Marks you somehow in possibly?

49:45.181 --> 49:48.402
And then you so obsessed with this thing then you just go completely mad?

49:48.443 --> 49:51.626
- 'Cause that's what we're dealing with it?  - Maybe they found a way to make it stop.

49:51.666 --> 49:53.315
Yeah. Or, God, maybe they didn't, guys.

49:53.353 --> 49:54.311
I mean, I'm telling you,

49:54.349 --> 49:56.460
- they could be lying somewhere dead.  - Stop, stop.

49:56.494 --> 49:57.612
That's what I'm only saying.

49:57.650 --> 50:00.259
We need to figure out where they went.

50:17.331 --> 50:20.094
- Anything? - No, nothing.

50:26.806 --> 50:30.376
Hey.

50:36.398 --> 50:38.739
How long have you been following me around?

50:42.192 --> 50:45.414
Well, technically I started the night we met.

50:54.813 --> 50:56.731
You know, I ... I told myself ...

50:56.768 --> 51:01.719
when I started that ... You know, I was doing it because I...

51:04.902 --> 51:07.128
You know, I ... I loved you.

51:08.239 --> 51:13.958
You know, and I wanted ... I wanted to make sure you were safe,

51:13.996 --> 51:16.565
that you're okay and when you're gonna go to your meetings.

51:21.554 --> 51:25.851
You know, the truth is, I started ...

51:27.806 --> 51:29.880
like that and then ...

51:29.918 --> 51:32.641
but I kept going because I just, uh...

51:32.679 --> 51:37.706
I didn't know how to stop.

52:23.014 --> 52:24.277
Hey, Charlie?

52:24.318 --> 52:25.813
- Charlie, you gotta wake up.  - Yeah.

52:25.853 --> 52:27.311
- Why?  - Sara is not here. I don't know.

52:27.349 --> 52:29.152
I don't know where she...

52:29.190 --> 52:30.724
- What are you doing?  - What are you doing?

52:30.762 --> 52:32.181
Where have you been?

52:32.222 --> 52:33.911
- Where did you go?   - I just trying to get some air.

52:33.949 --> 52:35.789
Urghh...

52:35.827 --> 52:37.132
- Why didn't you take the camera?   - I'm sorry.

52:37.170 --> 52:39.280
- It's Charlie.  - Chill out.

52:39.320 --> 52:40.855
Oh God,I tell you I've got good news.

52:40.893 --> 52:43.577
- You really should have take a camera.   - Holy shit, are you serious?

52:43.614 --> 52:45.456
Alright, give me a second. I'll go get something to write it down.

52:45.494 --> 52:48.373
Let me get a pen. Okay, yeah?

52:48.411 --> 52:51.018
What is it? Charlie, what is it?

52:51.056 --> 52:54.050
Okay. Yep.

52:56.047 --> 52:57.773
Oh, you're a handsome man and I love you.

52:57.811 --> 52:59.612
I already told you that before? Thank you so much, buddy.

52:59.652 --> 53:05.599
2901 Little Cape Road, Alma, Colorado. 81210.

53:05.637 --> 53:07.018
What is that?

53:07.056 --> 53:09.434
Bureau got to hit on Dan Wittlocke's credit card

53:09.472 --> 53:12.005
and apparently he ordered something and had a shoot it to this address.

53:12.043 --> 53:15.344
I say, we go there and play a little more, Milo.

53:15.382 --> 53:17.454
I might need your help packing up the projector.

53:17.492 --> 53:18.492
Yeah.

53:25.702 --> 53:27.467
- Hey, Charlie. - Yeah?

53:28.387 --> 53:30.114
Lift up your shirt.

53:30.148 --> 53:31.148
What?

53:32.300 --> 53:34.601
- Look. - Oh shit.

53:34.907 --> 53:36.940
- What? - Shit.

53:39.130 --> 53:41.085
When did it happen?

53:54.666 --> 53:56.547
Thank you.

53:56.585 --> 53:57.697
No way.

53:57.735 --> 54:00.498
WELCOME TO ALABAMA BEAUTIFUL

54:15.574 --> 54:18.148
Milo. What are you doing over there?

54:30.922 --> 54:33.684
- Look, could I ask you something?  - Sure, yeah.

54:36.253 --> 54:40.052
You got, uh... fired from Boston, right?

54:43.887 --> 54:45.152
Why?

54:49.030 --> 54:52.177
We had create a differences. It was totally encore.

54:53.135 --> 54:54.746
- Really? - No, not at all.

54:54.784 --> 54:59.389
I walked into my boss's office and I smashed up everything with a light knife.

55:00.920 --> 55:02.610
- Jesus Christ, really? - Yeah.

55:02.648 --> 55:05.871
We doing a story on a charge of school in Boston

55:05.909 --> 55:08.672
sticking bibles for the extra kids.

55:08.710 --> 55:13.007
As it turns out, my boss's son was one of the kids.

55:13.391 --> 55:17.304
- No, shit. - So, of course, he tried to shut this down.

55:17.342 --> 55:19.184
I didn't like that very much.

55:19.222 --> 55:21.561
And I got very angry.

55:21.601 --> 55:23.172
I lost my temper.

55:23.210 --> 55:28.507
It was trying to like if something that I couldn't stop myself doing.

55:28.545 --> 55:30.389
Does makes sense.

55:31.998 --> 55:34.876
Yeah, does makes sense.

55:36.103 --> 55:39.480
- Yo, you want me to drive?  - No, I'm alright, man.

55:39.518 --> 55:41.474
- Sure? - Yeah.

55:47.498 --> 55:49.070
Oh, Marty. Marty.

55:49.108 --> 55:51.141
I get so much dog hair from here.

55:51.179 --> 55:53.213
There is Sarah.

55:53.253 --> 55:55.706
Marty, are you okay? Good boy.

55:55.746 --> 55:58.202
Do you think she's okay?

55:58.239 --> 56:00.617
I have no idea. How do you think I should act?

56:00.657 --> 56:03.418
Hey, come on. Sit.

56:05.376 --> 56:06.909

58:05.032 --> 58:06.646
Charlie, wake up. Milo is gone.

58:10.327 --> 58:11.710
Shit.

58:11.748 --> 58:12.748
Milo.

58:14.358 --> 58:15.623
What are you doing?

58:18.460 --> 58:19.880
What are you doing?

58:20.840 --> 58:21.952
The ...

58:22.989 --> 58:26.902
I'm sorry. The headlights ... They were flickering.

58:26.940 --> 58:29.664
So, I had to come out here and fix them, you know?

58:47.773 --> 58:49.688
Marty, sit down.

58:49.726 --> 58:50.726
Stay.

58:54.563 --> 58:56.635
Hey, Milo, let me know if your hotspot had been running.

58:56.672 --> 58:58.016
- I need to know about it.  - It should be else in run.

58:58.094 --> 58:59.666

58:59.704 --> 59:01.545

59:01.583 --> 59:03.311
Yeah, I'm looking at it. I got it.

59:04.422 --> 59:05.878
I got it. I got it.

59:05.918 --> 59:10.675
Oh, no, we are long way to go. Goddammit.

59:10.715 --> 59:12.978
Man, I think it got too hot in the car.

59:13.054 --> 59:15.434
- What?  - The projector's not working.

59:15.817 --> 59:17.811
Sara, how you doing there? I got to use the restroom.

59:17.851 --> 59:19.117
Shit.

You okay?

59:21.456 --> 59:23.989
I'm fine. Hold on.

59:24.027 --> 59:25.869
- Milo?  - Yeah, what's wrong?

59:25.907 --> 59:28.284
I don't know.

59:28.322 --> 59:30.050
Sara, can we come in?

59:30.088 --> 59:31.967
Sara, what's wrong?

59:32.005 --> 59:34.114
Sara, open the door, ya?

59:34.152 --> 59:35.844
Sara, I'm gonna come in, OK?

59:35.882 --> 59:37.570
- Sara, open the ...   - Just leave me alone.

59:37.608 --> 59:38.835
She's not open up, Charlie.

59:38.873 --> 59:40.907
Sara, open the door.

59:40.945 --> 59:42.864
- Hey, hey.  - Leave me alone.

59:42.902 --> 59:45.396
I'm sorry. Are you okay? What's happen?

59:47.007 --> 59:48.849
Look, look, look.

59:48.885 --> 59:50.614

59:50.650 --> 59:52.722
- Goddammit, Milo.  - Just stop it. Sara, what is wrong?

59:52.760 --> 59:54.565
What do you doing with ...?

59:55.025 --> 59:56.405
Really? Now?

59:56.445 --> 59:58.135
- You kidding me?  - Give me my...

59:58.172 --> 59:59.630
No. Just stop.

59:59.668 --> 01:00:01.164
- What else you got?   - Come on, guys.

01:00:01.202 --> 01:00:02.507
What else you got?

01:00:02.545 --> 01:00:03.851
Let's see what else we can find here.

01:00:03.889 --> 01:00:04.925
- What else is inside, huh?  - Milo, Milo. stop, stop, stop!

01:00:04.963 --> 01:00:05.884
Get out of my ...

01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:07.378
Milo, come on. You're not helping.

01:00:07.418 --> 01:00:08.952
Bastard! Stop it!

01:00:08.989 --> 01:00:10.371
- Milo, stop.  - Charlie, you don't touch me!

01:00:10.409 --> 01:00:11.521
Hey, don't push her, Milo!

01:00:12.980 --> 01:00:14.976
- Stay out, Charlie!  - Do not put your hands on me, Milo!

01:00:15.014 --> 01:00:16.969
What will you gonna do? You gonna grab a light knife and go crazy on me ...?

01:00:17.009 --> 01:00:18.733
You piece of shit! What did you just said?!

01:00:32.545 --> 01:00:34.309
He's here.

01:00:34.349 --> 01:00:35.884
- Who is here?  - I think he's in the room.

01:00:35.922 --> 01:00:38.110
What happened? What happened?

01:00:38.148 --> 01:00:40.295
I don't know. I don't know.

01:00:42.137 --> 01:00:46.050
No gracious.There's no gracious.

01:00:55.295 --> 01:00:57.367
Look, I'm really sorry, again.

01:00:57.405 --> 01:01:00.514
I just don't have any goddamn idea what happened.

01:01:02.891 --> 01:01:04.811
How did that thing find us?

01:01:04.849 --> 01:01:07.880
Even talking about it. We have no idea what we talking about.

01:01:07.918 --> 01:01:10.911
It could be anything. You can only see him through the camera.

01:01:10.949 --> 01:01:13.137
Means it can be, what, anywhere?

01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:16.280
Is death.

01:01:19.197 --> 01:01:23.762
Doesn't seem like death could be done with you?

01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:26.257
Whatever is this, it makes you do things.

01:01:32.818 --> 01:01:33.929
- You alright to drive? - Yeah.

01:01:33.969 --> 01:01:35.579
- You sure?  - Yeah.

01:01:35.619 --> 01:01:36.619
Okay.

01:01:54.302 --> 01:01:55.302
Oh shit!

01:01:57.947 --> 01:02:01.820
Guys, we gotta stop. I've tried. I'm done.

01:02:09.416 --> 01:02:11.335
Guys...

01:02:11.373 --> 01:02:13.789
Guys.

01:02:13.829 --> 01:02:16.132
What if we just switched off the cameras?

01:02:18.777 --> 01:02:20.858
Why would we? Why we just shut off the camera?

01:02:22.114 --> 01:02:24.608
Because we can only see this thing through the camera

01:02:24.646 --> 01:02:25.838
and obviously he wants us to see him.

01:02:25.876 --> 01:02:28.253
What if we just shut them off?

01:02:28.291 --> 01:02:30.286
Yeah, I see it ...

01:02:30.326 --> 01:02:31.936
It's only anything we got it.

01:02:31.976 --> 01:02:36.693
Well, maybe ... Maybe it would go away. We do not know ... I mean, I ...

01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:39.304
Yeah, I think we should do it.

01:02:39.342 --> 01:02:41.106
- Really? - Yeah.

01:02:42.065 --> 01:02:43.715
What else we can do, Milo?

01:02:46.360 --> 01:02:47.780
Let's try it.

01:02:51.349 --> 01:02:52.349
You got it?

01:02:59.710 --> 01:03:01.440
Fine.

01:03:15.097 --> 01:03:16.668
Guys, wake up ...

01:03:22.195 --> 01:03:23.766
Marty?

01:03:28.869 --> 01:03:31.056
My dog stop moving! I don't know!

01:03:31.094 --> 01:03:32.094
I don't know what had happened.

01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:34.893
He's dead! You woke up and he's dead?

01:03:34.931 --> 01:03:37.617
Yes, Charlie. Why did you guys tell me to shut off the camera?

01:03:37.655 --> 01:03:38.766
- It was an idea, Milo.  - Why would you make me to shut off the camera?

01:03:38.806 --> 01:03:41.722
What will you do besides stop filming this guy?

01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:45.443
Oh shit! Jesus Christ.

01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:50.085
This is it?

01:03:52.809 --> 01:03:55.188
He was in the car.

01:04:01.056 --> 01:04:03.016
I'm really worry about him.

01:04:04.088 --> 01:04:06.619
I don't know what to say.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.264
Milo, I'm so sorry.

01:04:26.802 --> 01:04:29.103
WELCOME TO COLORFUL COLORADO

01:04:31.518 --> 01:04:33.668

01:04:33.708 --> 01:04:37.235
Yeah, I mean, it popped up in the GPS, alright? So...

01:04:40.188 --> 01:04:43.106
Yeah, these people they did not want to live out.

01:04:44.485 --> 01:04:48.246
Destination will be on your right in point two miles.

01:04:49.742 --> 01:04:52.427
You have arrived on your destination.

01:05:09.652 --> 01:05:11.380
Shit!

01:05:22.313 --> 01:05:23.695
Just let him go.

01:05:27.494 --> 01:05:28.989
- Hey guys?  - Yeah?

01:05:29.027 --> 01:05:30.563

01:05:37.967 --> 01:05:39.501
See that?

01:05:39.539 --> 01:05:41.534
- What? - What is that?

01:05:41.572 --> 01:05:43.489
Oh, you know that looks like?

01:05:43.527 --> 01:05:45.447
It looks like a ...

01:05:45.485 --> 01:05:47.597
Yeah, it looks like an RFM antenna.

01:05:47.635 --> 01:05:49.054
Yeah, what the ...?

01:05:49.092 --> 01:05:50.971
What the hell is that connected to?

01:05:57.224 --> 01:05:58.992
- Open it up? - Yeah.

01:05:59.027 --> 01:06:01.715
- Is there a latch or something?  - Yeah.

01:06:04.438 --> 01:06:06.088
- You need help?  - Nope.

01:06:15.449 --> 01:06:16.869
What's in it?

01:06:18.135 --> 01:06:21.166
It looks like a storm shelter.

01:06:21.242 --> 01:06:23.391
Charlie, go grab a flashlight from the truck, ya?

01:06:23.429 --> 01:06:25.309
Hello?

01:06:34.976 --> 01:06:36.931
Yeah, there is so much of shit down here.

01:06:36.974 --> 01:06:38.891
Careful, don't touch anything.

01:06:40.463 --> 01:06:43.342
Jesus, look at this.

01:06:43.380 --> 01:06:44.454
Come here.

01:06:49.746 --> 01:06:51.358
Oh shit.

01:06:53.621 --> 01:06:55.614
Uh, he totally lost it.

01:06:56.958 --> 01:06:58.610
What is this set up here?

01:07:03.518 --> 01:07:04.824
- Guys, there's light. - Give me the light.

01:07:04.864 --> 01:07:06.206
- I'm gonna try to find ... - There is a cord.

01:07:06.244 --> 01:07:07.664
There's a cord down here.

01:07:10.347 --> 01:07:12.996
Alright.

01:07:14.643 --> 01:07:16.027
Well, there you go.

01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:21.590
Well, go, go to the last entry.

01:07:23.277 --> 01:07:25.311
Oh shit.

01:07:26.271 --> 01:07:27.536
Oh man.

01:07:28.496 --> 01:07:30.722
Holy shit, he filmed the whole house.

01:08:37.398 --> 01:08:38.662
Dear?

01:08:48.368 --> 01:08:49.559
Tara?

01:08:49.595 --> 01:08:51.055
Honey?

01:08:51.134 --> 01:08:52.975
Wake up.

01:08:55.929 --> 01:08:59.073
No. Dan. What did you do?

01:09:00.417 --> 01:09:02.259
What did you do?

01:09:02.296 --> 01:09:04.751
Dan.

01:10:19.792 --> 01:10:21.328
I love you.

01:11:07.635 --> 01:11:11.126
It make us kill each other out of it? Is that it? That's it?

01:11:12.314 --> 01:11:14.538
It can't be. That's not it.

01:11:14.578 --> 01:11:15.881
You know what, I'm taking this.

01:11:18.145 --> 01:11:21.060
So, what're we gonna do now?

01:11:23.363 --> 01:11:24.782
Hey, pond there.

01:11:24.819 --> 01:11:28.314
I'm sorry, sir. Did you know they were the Wittlockes when you found them?

01:11:28.350 --> 01:11:31.804
Oh we didn't know who they were actually until after the fire.

01:11:31.841 --> 01:11:35.180
I see some things up here. The hunting accidents and all it like.

01:11:35.216 --> 01:11:36.636
But I never seen anything like this bad.

01:11:36.676 --> 01:11:38.095
By the time the trucks got there,

01:11:39.515 --> 01:11:42.430
husband and the kid are quite  burnt toast.

01:11:42.466 --> 01:11:43.734
What about the wife, Rose?

01:11:43.774 --> 01:11:45.844
She was still kick in.

01:11:45.881 --> 01:11:49.489
I'm sorry, wait. Is she still alive?

01:11:50.872 --> 01:11:52.136
Barely.

01:11:52.175 --> 01:11:55.283
She is trap inside the psychiatric Stratton, she is gonna stay for very long time.

01:12:01.613 --> 01:12:02.801
Uh, I'll be right back.

01:12:03.989 --> 01:12:05.716
Hold on, guys, wait for a second.

01:12:05.756 --> 01:12:07.904
- 1138.  - Oh shit.

01:12:07.939 --> 01:12:09.899
You see that? Did you see it?

01:12:09.939 --> 01:12:11.895
Who? That guy?

01:12:11.934 --> 01:12:13.658
Have they seen it?

01:12:13.698 --> 01:12:17.341
- What?  - The one who is not there?

01:12:17.377 --> 01:12:19.567
No, I don't think so.

01:12:19.604 --> 01:12:21.792
Of course you haven't.

01:12:21.828 --> 01:12:23.634
He's not there.

01:12:24.859 --> 01:12:26.854
- Not there.  - Come on, Parson.

01:12:26.894 --> 01:12:28.274
He is not...

01:12:31.573 --> 01:12:32.728
What the fuck...?

01:12:50.872 --> 01:12:52.636
Alright, come on.

01:13:13.354 --> 01:13:15.233
Is it okay if we ...?

01:13:15.310 --> 01:13:17.613
- Yes, you're allowed.  - Okay.

01:13:19.532 --> 01:13:21.296
Ms. Wittlocke?

01:13:26.399 --> 01:13:28.509
Ms. Wittlocke, my name is Sara Kovic.

01:13:28.546 --> 01:13:32.728
I am a reporter of Columbia and I wanted to ...

01:13:33.881 --> 01:13:36.256
ask you a couple questions about your family.

01:13:40.979 --> 01:13:46.042
If you want to talk about Dan, you gonna have to talk about his friend.

01:13:49.609 --> 01:13:51.488
His friend?

01:13:53.904 --> 01:13:58.087
What was the way would you call someone you invite into your life?

01:13:58.126 --> 01:14:00.962
Dan could not stop looking for him

01:14:01.002 --> 01:14:07.180
and that's why he opened the door and let it be in.

01:14:07.219 --> 01:14:09.099
But he left you alone.

01:14:11.822 --> 01:14:13.203
Did he?

01:14:16.118 --> 01:14:17.806
I don't know.

01:14:19.113 --> 01:14:24.100
All I know is this as soon as Dan died ...

01:14:27.054 --> 01:14:28.279
He went away.

01:14:28.319 --> 01:14:29.547
He is with you!

01:14:29.586 --> 01:14:30.734
- No!  - You brought him here!

01:14:30.774 --> 01:14:32.078
- No, he is here!  - Sara.

01:14:32.154 --> 01:14:33.154
He is here!

01:14:33.189 --> 01:14:35.185
Get away from me! Get out of here!

01:15:13.399 --> 01:15:14.550
Want to take this?

01:15:27.822 --> 01:15:29.470
Yes, we're okay.

01:15:38.756 --> 01:15:40.484
Put it up there or some places.

01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:42.247
I 'm gonna put one up back.

01:15:54.756 --> 01:15:56.750
Tell me, where are we gonna go? What are we gonna do?

01:15:56.788 --> 01:15:58.250
Who wouldn't take this? I mean,

01:15:58.283 --> 01:16:00.778
you know we can't keep moving from town to town,

01:16:00.814 --> 01:16:03.654
- Setting cameras up there whenever we go. - No, obviously.

01:16:03.694 --> 01:16:04.845
- I know. - Rose survived.

01:16:04.881 --> 01:16:07.221
Rose survived and she is the only one who survived.

01:16:07.261 --> 01:16:11.096
What does that mean? You stick together and all kill yourself? Or you what?

01:16:11.136 --> 01:16:13.091
- You separate?  - I don't know.

01:16:13.130 --> 01:16:14.435
And then you kill yourself.

01:16:14.471 --> 01:16:16.278
You kill somebody that has no idea about this thing?

01:16:16.317 --> 01:16:19.921
I mean ... Maybe it's better if we split up.

01:16:20.881 --> 01:16:22.340
That we are not in danger with each other.

01:16:22.377 --> 01:16:24.908
What else? You saw the videos in the house.

01:16:26.136 --> 01:16:28.015
He suffocated his daughter.

01:16:29.666 --> 01:16:32.582
I don't want that to happen to us, where all we kill each other.

01:16:43.823 --> 01:16:45.127
He is with you.

01:16:45.167 --> 01:16:46.201
- It is not like this. - You brought him.

01:16:46.238 --> 01:16:47.621
- No, he's not here.   - Sara.

01:16:47.658 --> 01:16:49.501
He is here. He is here.

01:16:51.417 --> 01:16:55.176
All I know is that as soon as Dan died ...

01:16:55.216 --> 01:16:57.442
he went away.

01:16:59.667 --> 01:17:02.046
Dan died and he went away.

01:17:10.564 --> 01:17:12.020
- Hey guys?  - Yeah?

01:17:12.059 --> 01:17:13.747
I have to show you something.

01:17:21.957 --> 01:17:23.685
These are the footage in the hospital.

01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:27.252
- Yeah?  - Do you see her wrist?

01:17:27.291 --> 01:17:29.131
The mark's gone.

01:17:33.122 --> 01:17:35.001
- Do you see your wrist?  - Yeah.

01:17:38.340 --> 01:17:40.448
Dan died and the mark's gone.

01:17:46.511 --> 01:17:49.158
Shit. Charlie, get the another camera.

01:17:50.729 --> 01:17:52.573
- Did you see something?  - I don't see anything.

01:17:52.609 --> 01:17:54.680
Shit. It's all black.

01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:56.755
He's here. He's here.

01:17:56.792 --> 01:17:59.667
Sara. Stay close to Charlie, okay?

01:17:59.707 --> 01:18:01.550
Oh Jesus.

01:18:01.587 --> 01:18:02.930
Come on, let's ...

01:18:08.761 --> 01:18:10.680
Hey, guys, what are you doing?

01:18:13.943 --> 01:18:15.743
Sara, this way.

01:18:18.006 --> 01:18:19.542
Right there. Next to your left.

01:18:19.581 --> 01:18:21.384
Milo, what are you doing, man?

01:18:21.421 --> 01:18:23.417
Oh my God.

01:18:23.453 --> 01:18:25.104
Milo.

01:18:25.143 --> 01:18:27.407
Sara.

01:18:27.444 --> 01:18:28.828
Everything's gonna be ok.

01:18:28.867 --> 01:18:30.055
What are you doing man?

01:18:45.094 --> 01:18:47.202
Jesus Christ.

01:18:49.042 --> 01:18:51.154
I think he's gone.

01:18:53.113 --> 01:18:55.377
Sara? Sara.

01:18:55.412 --> 01:18:57.792
I think it's over.

01:18:59.863 --> 01:19:02.854
Sara, are you okay?

01:19:02.895 --> 01:19:04.313
Shit.

01:19:04.350 --> 01:19:05.770
Sara.

01:19:11.219 --> 01:19:12.984
- It is okay. - No.

01:19:13.024 --> 01:19:14.024
It is okay.

01:19:14.059 --> 01:19:16.131
Alright, come here. Come here.

01:19:20.886 --> 01:19:22.613
Milo.

01:19:22.653 --> 01:19:24.264
-  Milo?  - Sara, get back.

01:19:24.301 --> 01:19:25.760
Milo?

01:19:25.796 --> 01:19:27.676
Jesus Christ, Milo.

01:19:32.282 --> 01:19:34.506
Stay away.

01:19:40.261 --> 01:19:41.796
Oh God.

01:20:05.046 --> 01:20:06.426
Help!

01:20:29.060 --> 01:20:32.322
Milo.

01:21:11.301 --> 01:21:13.372
No, honey, we are still in Alabama,

01:21:13.448 --> 01:21:15.750
but we will be home tomorrow evening.

01:21:15.787 --> 01:21:17.055
Okay.

01:21:17.091 --> 01:21:18.779
Yes, Mommy misses you.

01:21:18.858 --> 01:21:20.893
Give your brother a kiss from me

01:21:20.930 --> 01:21:24.152
and tell him not to cause too much problem for Makaela, okay?

01:21:24.189 --> 01:21:27.300
Alright. Bye bye.

01:21:27.337 --> 01:21:29.600
Dan, this is why you don't take to garage sales.

01:21:29.639 --> 01:21:32.171
That you went around for three seconds and buy this camera?

01:21:32.210 --> 01:21:36.430
Did you know this camera would have cost like  three times as much if I bought Costco?

01:21:36.469 --> 01:21:39.997
- Alright. Doesn't it work?  - It's working right now. Even had a tape in it.

01:21:40.036 --> 01:21:41.916
Somebody's art filming or something.

01:21:41.953 --> 01:21:42.913
- What do you mean? - I don't know.

01:21:42.953 --> 01:21:43.988
Some kid like chasing a guy ...

01:21:44.103 --> 01:21:45.216
wearing a suit to the wood with a flashlight.

01:21:45.252 --> 01:21:48.747
And here I was hoping it stumbled upon up something fun.

01:21:48.822 --> 01:21:52.926
Oh well, we can put something fun about that.

01:21:53.886 --> 01:21:55.153
- Dan. - No?

01:21:55.189 --> 01:21:56.533
- Put it away. - Totally kidding.

01:21:56.573 --> 01:21:57.912
- Yeah.  - Right.

01:22:01.136 --> 01:22:02.591
Dan.

01:22:02.631 --> 01:22:04.471
What are you doing?

01:22:04.511 --> 01:22:06.122
You're beautiful.

01:22:06.162 --> 01:22:08.270
Sometimes I remember something.

01:22:09.270 --> 01:22:10.920
Just put it away.

01:22:10.957 --> 01:22:13.297
Yes, of course. Let's get out of here.

01:22:13.337 --> 01:22:14.372
What are you talking about?

01:22:14.408 --> 01:22:16.060
Where is the power?
