00:12.387 --> 00:14.554
Trust me. This isn't the story

00:14.556 --> 00:17.149
I expected to be telling,

00:17.151 --> 00:18.967
but you know as well as I do

00:18.969 --> 00:22.896
that stories, like the
people who tell them,

00:22.898 --> 00:25.407
aren't always what they seem.

01:00.635 --> 01:02.811
Let's take a picture, Beth.

01:08.343 --> 01:11.536
Mom! Wake up! No! Mom!

01:13.064 --> 01:15.958
Batman's here. He's gonna save us!

01:27.554 --> 01:30.489
Batman, where are you going? Wait!

01:30.492 --> 01:32.057
You're leaving us to die!

01:32.059 --> 01:34.484
Beth, grab my hand!

01:34.487 --> 01:36.281
Grab my hand!

01:36.284 --> 01:40.782
- Kate!
- Mom, Beth, no!

01:54.773 --> 01:57.838
- Too slow.
- You covered the damn hole!

02:00.111 --> 02:02.681
And you found way, own way.

02:02.684 --> 02:05.661
Tomorrow, find faster.

02:07.936 --> 02:09.745
Brrr.

02:11.206 --> 02:14.674
I suppose I should
start here in Gotham.

02:14.676 --> 02:17.719
3 years ago when Batman
mysteriously disappeared,

02:17.722 --> 02:19.763
it divided the city.

02:19.766 --> 02:21.105
Some hoped he'd be back,

02:21.108 --> 02:22.924
others figured he was dead.

02:22.926 --> 02:25.633
I thought he abandoned
Gotham for the same reason

02:25.636 --> 02:27.677
he abandoned my family...

02:27.680 --> 02:29.990
because he didn't care.

02:55.976 --> 02:58.501
How cute is this little kid?

02:58.503 --> 03:00.724
Mary, you're embarrassing me.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.012
Excuse me, ma'am.

03:10.014 --> 03:13.077
Heh heh. This isn't
beneath you, Commander?

03:13.080 --> 03:17.404
Well, it's the only excuse I
have to see my radiant wife.

03:17.406 --> 03:19.964
KATE, VOICE-OVER: Concerned
the police couldn't keep order

03:19.967 --> 03:23.464
in a Gotham without Batman,
my dad started Crows Security,

03:23.467 --> 03:25.359
a private firm that protects the people

03:25.362 --> 03:28.340
that the Dark Knight left behind.

03:28.342 --> 03:31.009
Moore to Crows' nest.
North side's clear.

03:31.011 --> 03:32.440
How are we out front?

03:32.443 --> 03:33.985
Perimeter looks good.

03:33.988 --> 03:35.830
What's the word, Vasquez?

03:35.832 --> 03:37.812
- West Side's clear.
- Copy.

03:37.815 --> 03:39.915
Let's lock it up.

03:41.596 --> 03:43.569
All right, Dodgson. How much?

03:43.572 --> 03:46.817
10,000 bucks a plate just
to watch a light flip off.

03:46.819 --> 03:48.843
- Must be nice.
- Heh.

03:53.183 --> 03:55.919
Operational leadership
at its best, Agent Moore.

03:55.922 --> 03:57.380
Well done tonight.

03:57.383 --> 03:58.622
My pleasure, sir.

03:59.839 --> 04:03.541
Ladies and gentlemen,
tonight is about reality.

04:03.544 --> 04:06.027
Batman gave up on us.

04:06.029 --> 04:08.121
It's been 3 years, Gotham.

04:08.123 --> 04:10.623
The Bat's not coming back.

04:10.625 --> 04:13.071
Mayor Akins, help us say good-bye

04:13.074 --> 04:15.035
to Gotham's outdated tradition.

04:15.038 --> 04:18.723
It's time to turn off the signal.

04:24.756 --> 04:26.380
My kid used to stare at this thing

04:26.382 --> 04:27.715
through his bedroom window.

04:27.717 --> 04:29.425
Now I got to be the one to flip it off?

04:29.427 --> 04:31.928
Together, I invite you to gaze out

04:31.930 --> 04:34.182
at the Bat-Signal one last time.

04:36.076 --> 04:39.258
Uh, Commander Kane, I just
lost our city surveillance.

04:39.261 --> 04:40.812
What about the rooftop feed?

04:40.815 --> 04:43.700
- Sir, we're totally blind.
- Something's up.

04:43.703 --> 04:45.129
Eyes everywhere.

04:46.652 --> 04:48.680
We're gonna start the
countdown, Officer.

04:48.683 --> 04:50.471
Copy. Standing by.

04:50.474 --> 04:51.946
10...

04:51.949 --> 04:53.216
Agh!

04:53.218 --> 04:55.068
8, 7...

04:55.071 --> 04:56.056
Unh!

04:56.059 --> 04:59.695
6, 5, 4,

04:59.698 --> 05:03.458
3, 2, 1.

05:09.801 --> 05:11.650
Turn the light off, boys.

05:11.653 --> 05:14.112
What's happening?

05:19.441 --> 05:21.226
"Hello", said Alice.

05:21.229 --> 05:23.866
"Shall we believe the
Crows will protect us?"

05:23.876 --> 05:26.848
Heh heh heh. Well, I
believe 6 impossible things

05:26.851 --> 05:28.475
before breakfast.

05:28.478 --> 05:31.279
Do you feel safe behind
these security gates?

05:31.281 --> 05:34.830
Ha ha! Because one of you
won't be going home tonight.

05:34.833 --> 05:40.195
The Crows are not the
hero of this story, Gotham.

05:40.198 --> 05:43.625
Batman couldn't save you,

05:43.628 --> 05:47.472
and neither... will... they.

05:50.958 --> 05:52.717
Get these people out of here now.

05:52.719 --> 05:54.543
Let's go. Let's go.

05:54.546 --> 05:55.640
Mom?

05:55.643 --> 05:57.045
Jacob, what the hell are you...

05:57.048 --> 05:59.010
Get out now. Let's go.

06:22.949 --> 06:25.969
Agent Moore, do you copy?

06:25.972 --> 06:27.128
Hyah!

06:27.131 --> 06:29.156
Sophie, do you copy?

06:37.635 --> 06:38.968
Aah!

06:38.971 --> 06:40.260
Unh!

06:40.263 --> 06:42.005
Aah!

06:42.008 --> 06:43.832
Ohh!

06:43.835 --> 06:45.894
We got her.

06:52.449 --> 06:53.940
Aah!

07:15.505 --> 07:17.028
Call for you.

07:17.031 --> 07:19.591
Girl who talk too much.

07:27.605 --> 07:30.773
- Hello?
- Kate, it's Mary.

07:30.776 --> 07:32.877
- Your stepsister.
- Mary, our parents

07:32.880 --> 07:34.402
have been married for over a decade.

07:34.404 --> 07:35.736
I know who you are.

07:35.738 --> 07:38.256
Oh. Okay. You have to swear
you won't tell anyone

07:38.258 --> 07:41.617
- I'm telling you this...
- Mary, what happened?

07:41.619 --> 07:45.597
Sophie's missing. They
think someone took her.

07:45.599 --> 07:48.778
I just... I thought you should know.

07:48.781 --> 07:50.581
Ha ha!

07:59.817 --> 08:02.242
KATE, VOICE-OVER: I'd spent
years traveling the world,

08:02.245 --> 08:04.699
training with combat and
survivalist specialists

08:04.701 --> 08:06.213
so I could join the Crows.

08:06.216 --> 08:08.667
Sophie's disappearance
brought me home early.

08:08.670 --> 08:10.901
I had to find her, but first,

08:10.904 --> 08:13.458
I had to convince my dad I was ready.

08:13.460 --> 08:16.536
Crows represent
order, security, safety.

08:16.538 --> 08:19.631
These monsters long
for the good, old days

08:19.633 --> 08:21.315
when gangs ran around unchecked.

08:21.318 --> 08:24.302
They spread fear by saying, "look at us.

08:24.304 --> 08:26.427
We can get a Crow,
we can get your wife,

08:26.430 --> 08:28.147
your kid."

08:28.150 --> 08:29.715
Where are we on surveillance?

08:29.718 --> 08:31.417
Afraid it doesn't exist, sir.

08:31.419 --> 08:32.918
If it were any one of you,

08:32.919 --> 08:34.905
Agent Moore would not sleep

08:34.908 --> 08:37.075
until you were found.

08:37.078 --> 08:39.193
Let's do the same for her.

08:39.197 --> 08:41.381
Let's bring her home.

08:51.059 --> 08:52.559
Kate.

08:52.562 --> 08:54.121
Hey, Dad.

08:57.552 --> 08:59.677
Come here, kiddo.

09:07.538 --> 09:09.472
I, uh... I didn't have cream,

09:09.474 --> 09:12.896
but please tell me you
kicked that vegan thing, huh?

09:12.899 --> 09:14.502
I wish you'd called.

09:14.504 --> 09:16.816
- We're gonna find her.
- Then let me help.

09:16.819 --> 09:18.161
Neck tattoo. That's new.

09:18.164 --> 09:20.840
Dad, I'm ready to come
home and work for you.

09:20.843 --> 09:22.485
Sir, Mayor's on two.

09:22.487 --> 09:25.299
He's talking about canceling
the movie in the park.

09:25.302 --> 09:27.528
Tell him I'll be right there.

09:30.139 --> 09:31.930
Do you know who took her?

09:31.933 --> 09:33.554
Ruthless, spineless maniacs

09:33.557 --> 09:35.448
who frankly don't stand
a chance against a team

09:35.450 --> 09:37.650
of ex-Navy SEALs and Green Berets.

09:37.652 --> 09:40.781
- And what about me?
- You take after your cousin.

09:40.784 --> 09:42.530
You're a female Bruce Wayne,

09:42.532 --> 09:44.549
but unlike him, you actually have a shot

09:44.551 --> 09:46.304
at making something of your life.

09:46.307 --> 09:48.900
Bruce was the one person
who was actually there for me

09:48.903 --> 09:50.235
after Mom and Beth died.

09:50.238 --> 09:53.892
Let me help the Crows find Sophie.

09:53.894 --> 09:58.104
It's great to see you, but
I got to take this call.

10:01.656 --> 10:03.439
Ha ha!

10:07.532 --> 10:09.291
How about we don't get expelled

10:09.294 --> 10:12.078
a week before graduation?

10:12.081 --> 10:13.753
About that.

10:13.756 --> 10:15.873
How about after we graduate

10:15.876 --> 10:17.500
I take you to the Greek isles

10:17.503 --> 10:19.626
for a week alone on a yacht?

10:19.629 --> 10:20.715
All alone...

10:20.718 --> 10:24.647
But, like, with a chef?

10:24.650 --> 10:27.254
- Obviously.
- Heh.

10:29.398 --> 10:33.951
Oh, Shed, things you have seen.

10:33.954 --> 10:37.214
Defacing school property.

10:37.217 --> 10:38.932
Heh. Why not?

10:38.935 --> 10:41.299
Got me to break every other rule.

10:45.887 --> 10:48.971
"Loves." Bold.

10:58.488 --> 10:59.982
Cadet Katherine Kane,

10:59.984 --> 11:01.752
is there something you'd like to report

11:01.755 --> 11:02.766
to your squad?

11:02.769 --> 11:04.035
Not that I'm aware of, sir!

11:04.038 --> 11:05.988
Perhaps, you're not
aware of the Academy's

11:05.991 --> 11:07.949
code of conduct.

11:07.952 --> 11:09.758
KATE, VOICE-OVER: I had to find her,

11:09.761 --> 11:11.533
so I needed to go to the one place

11:11.536 --> 11:13.795
that always seemed to have the answers,

11:13.798 --> 11:15.423
to the heart of Gotham,

11:15.426 --> 11:18.958
which just happened to
have eyes all over the city.

11:55.015 --> 11:57.790
Bruce isn't
in his office. Come on.

11:57.792 --> 11:59.833
Kate, we're not
supposed to be in here.

12:09.033 --> 12:13.360
What's that? Why
does Bruce have a girl's necklace?

12:13.363 --> 12:15.622
Come on.

12:17.370 --> 12:20.104
No. I don't think
we're supposed to touch that.

12:20.107 --> 12:22.441
Come on.

12:22.444 --> 12:24.862
Step away from the desk! Move!

12:31.113 --> 12:32.555
Wayne Security.

12:32.558 --> 12:36.319
Not to tell you how
to do your job, Mr...

12:36.322 --> 12:37.988
- Luke.
- Luke,

12:37.991 --> 12:40.008
but your boss is my cousin.

12:40.011 --> 12:42.320
Think you're the first
squatter I've met related

12:42.323 --> 12:43.421
to Bruce Wayne?

12:43.424 --> 12:45.023
How the hell did you even get in here?

12:45.026 --> 12:47.305
I'm Kate Kane. I
practically grew up here,

12:47.308 --> 12:50.913
and Bruce was like my fun,
irresponsible big brother.

12:50.916 --> 12:53.528
Okay. When's his birthday?

12:53.531 --> 12:56.908
- February 19.
- Middle name?

12:56.911 --> 12:58.366
Trick question. Doesn't have one.

12:58.369 --> 12:59.702
Favorite soup?

12:59.705 --> 13:01.913
Is it weird that you know that?

13:03.475 --> 13:04.958
If you are Bruce's cousin,

13:04.960 --> 13:06.860
you know that no one's heard from him

13:06.863 --> 13:08.503
in almost 3 years.

13:17.171 --> 13:19.263
Hey. Yeah. Luke Fox over at Wayne here.

13:19.265 --> 13:21.557
Got another B&E for you.

13:23.344 --> 13:26.920
Bruce gave me a great
piece of advice once.

13:26.922 --> 13:28.797
Grow into the person
you needed as a kid.

13:28.799 --> 13:30.441
That's great. Police are on their way.

13:30.443 --> 13:33.721
Oh. It... it turns out that the
person that I needed as a kid

13:33.724 --> 13:35.325
can do this.

13:39.953 --> 13:43.834
Hey! Get these handcuffs
off me right now.

13:43.837 --> 13:46.054
Password still "Alfred"?

13:46.057 --> 13:48.253
- Hey!
- You might want to change that.

13:48.256 --> 13:50.715
Wait. You can't...

13:50.718 --> 13:53.418
can you just step away
from the computer, please?

13:53.421 --> 13:55.267
Agh.

13:55.270 --> 13:57.259
Hey. What are you doing?

13:57.262 --> 13:59.040
What the Crows aren't able to.

13:59.043 --> 14:00.802
Get this thing off me.

14:03.566 --> 14:06.918
Hey, hey. You can't just...

14:10.980 --> 14:12.733
See the relation now.

14:22.428 --> 14:27.056
Dad, I think I found something.

14:27.056 --> 14:28.878
Surprise!

14:28.881 --> 14:30.089
Aah!

14:30.092 --> 14:32.134
Keep us waiting, why don't you?

14:32.137 --> 14:33.302
- Hi.
- Hi!

14:33.305 --> 14:34.448
- Mary.
- Hi.

14:34.451 --> 14:36.151
Where's, uh... where's my dad?

14:36.154 --> 14:41.408
No idea because you, me,
cotton candy shots now. Good?

14:41.411 --> 14:43.494
So I'm on the roof, Alice
is threatening to kill

14:43.496 --> 14:45.383
literally everybody,
and the first thought

14:45.408 --> 14:47.708
that pops into my brain is
"Oh, my God. What a bummer.

14:47.710 --> 14:50.079
Now I'll never be able to read
my future children 'Alice in Wonderland'",

14:50.079 --> 14:51.787
but then I was like, "Oh, Mary,

14:51.789 --> 14:53.798
rearranging your entire life out of fear

14:53.800 --> 14:55.508
is exactly how the terrorists win."

14:55.511 --> 14:56.953
Why did you call me?

14:56.956 --> 14:58.962
I may have found a box
of pictures in your closet

14:58.965 --> 15:00.371
when I was borrowing
your Balenciaga T...

15:00.373 --> 15:02.476
- You know what? Never mind.
- Look. I don't know your drama,

15:02.478 --> 15:04.562
but we all got a box
of picture somewhere.

15:04.565 --> 15:07.416
I just thought you'd want to be here.

15:07.419 --> 15:09.513
Welcome home, Katie.

15:09.515 --> 15:11.024
I hope you don't mind my making you

15:11.026 --> 15:13.276
the center of attention tonight.

15:13.278 --> 15:14.776
No place I'd rather be.

15:14.779 --> 15:17.029
Then let's make sure
we're posting happy photos

15:17.032 --> 15:18.546
to our social media accounts.

15:18.549 --> 15:20.693
Because why wouldn't
this party have an agenda?

15:20.696 --> 15:21.720
If we feel safe,

15:21.723 --> 15:23.441
then our clients feel safe.

15:23.444 --> 15:24.885
Movie in the park is Friday,

15:24.888 --> 15:27.540
and it's Gotham's first
public event in 3 years.

15:27.543 --> 15:31.594
Anyway, the councilwoman
would like a photo, Mary.

15:31.597 --> 15:33.865
Excuse us.

15:42.024 --> 15:44.584
"I hereby deny
the below allegation

15:44.587 --> 15:46.586
of homosexual conduct."

15:46.589 --> 15:50.275
Blah, blah, blah. Kiss my ass.

15:51.434 --> 15:52.766
Guess that's that then.

15:52.769 --> 15:54.659
What do you say we burn these

15:54.661 --> 15:56.995
and scatter the ashes
across the Mediterranean?

16:02.121 --> 16:05.911
I can't. I'm staying.

16:09.725 --> 16:12.201
You signed it.

16:12.204 --> 16:15.442
I told them what they wanted to hear.

16:15.445 --> 16:16.713
You lied.

16:16.716 --> 16:19.333
I need this school, okay?
I want to be here.

16:19.335 --> 16:20.927
But they don't want you.

16:20.929 --> 16:25.673
Unfortunately, I don't have the
luxury of being offended by that.

16:29.575 --> 16:31.742
And maybe it's best if
you just kept your distance

16:31.745 --> 16:34.580
from now on.

16:34.583 --> 16:36.350
Hey.

16:39.135 --> 16:41.936
I know you love me.

16:43.043 --> 16:45.025
Tell me that I'm wrong,
and I'll walk away

16:45.027 --> 16:47.045
and let you make the
biggest mistake of your life.

16:49.655 --> 16:51.339
You're wrong, Kate.

16:54.462 --> 16:56.629
I have to go.

17:08.137 --> 17:11.347
Dad, I have something.

17:11.349 --> 17:12.979
Where'd you get this?

17:12.981 --> 17:15.926
Wayne's camera feed isn't
on the Crows' network.

17:15.930 --> 17:17.284
Wayne's defunct.

17:17.287 --> 17:20.204
Not sure how facial
rec's supposed to work here.

17:20.208 --> 17:22.308
They're in masks.

17:25.276 --> 17:28.377
Wait. What does that paddle say?

17:30.644 --> 17:34.591
"Milk", "well-behaved", "C-H".

17:34.594 --> 17:37.703
"Not for the mild, well-behaved child."

17:37.705 --> 17:40.122
It was their creepy
disciplinary motto.

17:40.124 --> 17:42.436
- It was whose model?
- The Burnside Orphanage.

17:42.439 --> 17:44.884
Beth and I used to sneak in
there with our ouija board

17:44.887 --> 17:46.219
and freak each other out.

17:46.222 --> 17:47.417
That's where they are.

17:47.420 --> 17:48.604
Taylor, get a satellite feed.

17:48.607 --> 17:50.119
I want eyes all over this.

17:50.122 --> 17:51.924
Dodgson, cover the
north entrance with me.

17:51.927 --> 17:54.520
Banks takes his team on the south.

17:56.899 --> 17:57.984
Kate.

18:32.038 --> 18:33.722
Aah!

18:55.509 --> 18:57.151
Unh!

19:23.489 --> 19:25.340
Aah!

19:45.876 --> 19:50.153
Curiouser and curiouser.

19:50.156 --> 19:52.782
Up, up.

19:56.135 --> 19:58.043
I thought you'd been sent away,

19:58.046 --> 20:01.450
but now you seem to be... here.

20:13.541 --> 20:17.692
How do you know me?

20:17.695 --> 20:19.504
Better now.

20:22.040 --> 20:23.748
Where's Sophie?

20:23.751 --> 20:26.043
Gone, and just in time

20:26.046 --> 20:30.357
because I am not used to being found.

20:30.360 --> 20:31.884
Clever girl.

20:31.887 --> 20:33.863
If you didn't want an audience,

20:33.866 --> 20:36.107
I'd be dead.

20:36.110 --> 20:37.893
So what do you want?

20:37.896 --> 20:41.065
I need you to send
your father a message.

20:41.068 --> 20:44.155
He thinks he's Gotham's white knight,

20:44.158 --> 20:46.291
but he's a bully whose army bullies

20:46.294 --> 20:47.785
this city into obedience,

20:47.788 --> 20:49.946
and I want the world to know

20:49.949 --> 20:52.734
that he doesn't scare me.

20:52.737 --> 20:54.061
Heh.

20:54.064 --> 20:57.892
I want to take away his power.

20:57.895 --> 21:01.705
Then take me and let Sophie go.

21:01.708 --> 21:07.345
Oh, dear. This is... Quite sad actually.

21:07.348 --> 21:09.232
You poor thing.

21:10.960 --> 21:12.810
You haven't figured it out yet.

21:12.812 --> 21:17.297
I took Sophie because she'll
actually get his attention.

21:17.299 --> 21:20.426
Your father doesn't want you, Kate.

21:20.428 --> 21:23.121
He shipped you away, and you show up

21:23.124 --> 21:25.350
without the proper postage.

21:27.143 --> 21:29.694
I assumed you knew,

21:29.697 --> 21:33.163
but then again, you have been so busy

21:33.166 --> 21:35.474
trying to convince him to love you,

21:35.477 --> 21:39.788
you sweet, pathetic girl.

21:41.490 --> 21:46.812
Sophie is the daughter
your father always wanted,

21:46.815 --> 21:51.267
not you... dear.

21:51.270 --> 21:53.756
Who the hell are you?

21:53.759 --> 21:55.309
Right.

21:55.312 --> 21:58.572
I'm Alice. How do you do?

22:07.309 --> 22:09.326
Dodgson, what do you got?

22:09.329 --> 22:11.149
- Just missed them, sir.
- Where's Kate?

22:11.149 --> 22:13.256
Found her bike stashed in some bushes

22:13.259 --> 22:14.276
but no sign of her.

22:14.279 --> 22:16.148
What do you mean no sign of her?

22:21.719 --> 22:23.323
Where am I?

22:23.326 --> 22:27.095
Hi, and don't kill me.

22:33.286 --> 22:34.638
What is this place?

22:34.640 --> 22:39.217
This is my humble,
little... Illegal clinic.

22:39.219 --> 22:41.461
Gotham University has generously

22:41.464 --> 22:44.206
and unknowingly leant me...

22:44.209 --> 22:46.056
Hey, Mr. Whittaker.

22:46.059 --> 22:48.601
We're gonna have to keep that on, okay?

22:48.603 --> 22:50.241
We talked about this, remember?

22:50.244 --> 22:51.802
Got to keep that on.

22:51.805 --> 22:54.381
Can we be done with
this? I got to... unh.

22:54.384 --> 22:57.060
Ooh. Ow. Hang on.

22:57.063 --> 22:59.037
I was mid-stitch.

23:00.442 --> 23:01.831
How did you find me?

23:01.833 --> 23:03.241
Someone dumped you at the door.

23:03.243 --> 23:04.891
One of my guys brought you in.

23:04.894 --> 23:07.395
You have guys?

23:07.398 --> 23:10.878
So I swear this began with me offering

23:10.881 --> 23:13.048
water and band-aids, and
the next thing you know,

23:13.051 --> 23:14.984
I'm the Meredith Grey
of Sherwood Forest.

23:14.987 --> 23:18.923
I'm sorry if stealing from my
med school makes me a bad person.

23:18.925 --> 23:22.426
It doesn't. It actually makes you

23:22.429 --> 23:23.934
deeper than I thought.

23:23.937 --> 23:26.455
Oh. Thanks.

23:28.101 --> 23:30.661
- Done.
- Keep your ear to the street,

23:30.664 --> 23:32.946
and if you hear anything
about Sophie, call.

23:32.949 --> 23:34.698
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

23:37.202 --> 23:39.639
I was right. Alice was there,

23:39.642 --> 23:42.447
and wherever they went,
it's probably not far.

23:42.449 --> 23:44.132
Where the hell have you been?

23:44.134 --> 23:45.450
We thought she took you, too.

23:45.452 --> 23:47.326
I got half my guys out
there looking for you!

23:47.328 --> 23:49.300
And here I am telling you her vendetta

23:49.303 --> 23:51.497
isn't against Gotham,
isn't against the Crows,

23:51.499 --> 23:52.982
but against you.

23:52.985 --> 23:54.966
- Why?
- You are not listening.

23:54.969 --> 23:56.525
You ran into an unknown terrorist cell

23:56.528 --> 23:57.603
without proper backup.

23:57.606 --> 23:58.950
If you treated me like everybody else,

23:58.952 --> 24:03.143
- I would have had backup.
- Except you're not everyone else.

24:03.146 --> 24:06.498
No, I'm not.

24:06.501 --> 24:08.680
I never will be

24:08.683 --> 24:13.146
because no matter what I do
trying to prove myself to you,

24:13.149 --> 24:15.241
you don't want me.

24:16.746 --> 24:20.832
What did I tell you after you
got expelled from the Academy?

24:20.835 --> 24:24.030
Kate, I love you. I wouldn't
want you any other way.

24:24.032 --> 24:25.207
I remember what you said because

24:25.209 --> 24:27.794
it was right before you sent
me away to train for a job

24:27.797 --> 24:28.870
that you were never gonna give me.

24:28.872 --> 24:30.695
I was giving you a second chance!

24:30.698 --> 24:33.431
You were getting rid of me!

24:33.434 --> 24:36.921
Because when you look
at me, you see Beth,

24:36.924 --> 24:39.670
and when you see Beth, you see Mom,

24:39.672 --> 24:41.141
and instead of dealing with it,

24:41.144 --> 24:44.225
you spent the last 15
years pushing me away!

24:46.438 --> 24:50.417
You win, Dad. I'm gone.

24:52.837 --> 24:54.645
Kate.

24:58.983 --> 25:01.378
Hey, hey, hey! Hey, hey!
How did you even get in... agh.

25:01.381 --> 25:02.735
I know you know where Bruce is.

25:02.737 --> 25:04.611
Call him and tell him that
I am looking for someone.

25:04.613 --> 25:06.982
- I have no idea where he is.
- That was me asking nicely.

25:06.985 --> 25:08.657
Okay. If Bruce wanted to come home...

25:08.660 --> 25:10.961
He would. He would for me.

25:10.964 --> 25:13.214
Okay. Ugh.

25:17.982 --> 25:19.940
Someone moved that.

25:19.943 --> 25:21.923
How the hell would you know?

25:24.551 --> 25:25.734
It was my Aunt Martha's.

25:25.736 --> 25:27.319
She was wearing it the night that she

25:27.321 --> 25:29.887
and my Uncle Thomas were killed,

25:29.889 --> 25:34.534
but he always kept it... here.

25:45.598 --> 25:47.817
Look. You... you don't
want to do that.

25:47.820 --> 25:49.352
I mean, it looks really old.

25:49.355 --> 25:51.281
Probably not even up to code, you know,

25:51.284 --> 25:53.376
if it even works.

25:57.423 --> 26:00.585
You are seriously not supposed
to know what's down there.

26:00.587 --> 26:02.554
So I have this thing with rules.

27:23.075 --> 27:25.534
Bruce Wayne is Batman?

27:27.811 --> 27:30.338
Yeah. I'm dead.

27:35.971 --> 27:38.944
KATE, VOICE-OVER: The Bruce
I knew had a million secrets,

27:38.947 --> 27:41.598
and now I know why
they were kept from me.

27:56.096 --> 27:57.428
Let's take a picture, Beth.

27:57.430 --> 27:59.453
Make sure our necklaces are in it.

27:59.456 --> 28:02.257
There. Ready? Cheese!

28:04.508 --> 28:06.148
What is this guy doing?

28:10.044 --> 28:11.313
Beth, are you okay?

28:11.316 --> 28:12.606
We're gonna go over!

28:12.609 --> 28:14.903
Batman's here. He's gonna save us!

28:17.409 --> 28:19.218
He spent years
trying to figure out

28:19.220 --> 28:20.960
what went wrong that day.

28:20.963 --> 28:22.797
He knew the car was gonna go over,

28:22.800 --> 28:24.508
so he shot two hooks,

28:24.511 --> 28:27.679
each with a safe load of one ton.

28:27.682 --> 28:29.960
The weight, the angle...

28:29.963 --> 28:32.297
he was so sure he secured the car.

28:32.299 --> 28:35.400
Go, Kate! Hurry! Get out!

28:35.402 --> 28:38.094
Where are you going, Batman? Wait!

28:38.096 --> 28:41.272
Wake up now! Mom, please!

28:41.275 --> 28:45.314
Beth, you need to grab my hand now!

28:45.317 --> 28:46.633
Kate!

28:46.636 --> 28:49.846
Grab my hand!

28:49.849 --> 28:51.607
No!

28:51.610 --> 28:55.612
Beth! No!

28:57.037 --> 29:00.530
Mom! Beth!

29:00.533 --> 29:03.374
The steel in the trunk
still ripped away.

29:03.377 --> 29:04.913
It was crappy engineering.

29:04.915 --> 29:07.340
It was the one calculation he didn't make.

29:07.342 --> 29:09.870
I grew up thinking
that Batman cared more

29:09.873 --> 29:12.179
about getting the bad guy than...

29:12.181 --> 29:14.282
The lives of innocent people.

29:14.285 --> 29:16.735
No. He cared.

29:16.738 --> 29:18.944
He saved 34 kids that day.

29:18.946 --> 29:21.623
He thought he saved
your mom and sister, too.

29:26.945 --> 29:29.051
I mean, his only living family,

29:29.054 --> 29:30.347
and he got it wrong.

29:30.350 --> 29:32.650
Haunted the hell out of him.

29:37.204 --> 29:39.080
Yeah. Don't push that.

29:47.113 --> 29:49.897
Whoa.

29:49.900 --> 29:52.218
Nope. Okay. Heh.

29:52.221 --> 29:55.770
Not about to get my ass
fired twice by Batman, so...

30:03.086 --> 30:05.729
Find your own way.

30:05.732 --> 30:09.493
- What?
- That's why Bruce became Batman,

30:09.496 --> 30:11.312
to play by his own rules.

30:11.314 --> 30:13.982
It made him terrifying to his enemies.

30:13.984 --> 30:15.959
Yeah, and his friends and his co-workers.

30:15.961 --> 30:17.134
We really need to go.

30:17.137 --> 30:19.479
People aren't afraid anymore.

30:19.482 --> 30:23.317
An army may not scare them,

30:23.320 --> 30:25.153
but that will.

30:26.329 --> 30:29.089
I need you to fix his suit.

30:29.091 --> 30:32.125
The suit is literal perfection.

30:32.127 --> 30:36.122
It will be... When it fits a woman.

30:40.269 --> 30:42.627
- Mary.
- We found one of Alice's guys.

30:42.630 --> 30:44.663
I think I know where they took Sophie.

31:23.543 --> 31:25.544
That'd be Dodgson, sir.

31:29.761 --> 31:31.525
Dodgson.

31:34.893 --> 31:36.522
I love it.

31:41.276 --> 31:42.877
Have fun.

31:44.353 --> 31:46.779
You, too.

31:46.782 --> 31:49.106
Traitor! Don't!

31:49.109 --> 31:50.876
Don't!

32:01.464 --> 32:02.766
Commander,

32:02.769 --> 32:05.531
dare I say Gotham is looking a little

32:05.534 --> 32:06.866
like the good, old days.

32:06.868 --> 32:08.084
Sorry I had my doubts.

32:08.086 --> 32:10.411
City trusts us for a reason, Mayor.

32:10.413 --> 32:12.529
Enjoy the movie. Excuse me.

32:12.532 --> 32:13.706
Kane.

32:13.709 --> 32:16.218
I haven't missed the show, have I?

32:18.305 --> 32:19.805
Now you tell me where you are,

32:19.807 --> 32:22.507
and then I'll dump you at Arkham myself.

32:22.509 --> 32:24.477
We're all mad here, Commander.

32:24.480 --> 32:25.810
I'm mad, you're mad.

32:25.813 --> 32:29.380
Sanity is so... pedestrian.

32:29.383 --> 32:31.245
I want to be memorable,

32:31.248 --> 32:33.911
the kind of girl who
never leaves your thoughts,

32:33.913 --> 32:35.579
so I took it upon myself

32:35.581 --> 32:38.889
to fill a Crows' truck
with forget-me-nots.

32:55.592 --> 32:58.421
"How do you like the
Queen?" said the cat.

32:58.424 --> 33:01.458
These are families, kids.

33:01.461 --> 33:03.716
Keep your mouth shut, and everyone

33:03.719 --> 33:06.801
will stay alive to see
how this boring movie ends.

33:06.803 --> 33:09.463
Try anything, and pfeewww!

33:09.466 --> 33:11.555
Look up.

33:11.558 --> 33:15.100
You'd never forget about
Sophie, would you, Commander,

33:15.103 --> 33:17.996
your favorite little
birdie up in the sky,

33:17.998 --> 33:19.187
but, oh, dear, oh, my,

33:19.190 --> 33:21.065
can your little birdie fly,

33:21.068 --> 33:23.342
for if she moves an inch,

33:23.345 --> 33:24.936
she'll die.

33:24.939 --> 33:26.305
Pick one, Commander...

33:26.308 --> 33:29.236
Sophie or Gotham.

33:30.868 --> 33:32.492
Why are you doing this?

33:32.495 --> 33:35.422
Why is a raven like a writing desk?

33:36.710 --> 33:38.519
Aah!

33:41.035 --> 33:42.785
Who's there?

33:44.849 --> 33:46.700
Aah!

33:52.610 --> 33:54.524
I thought you were dead.

34:01.742 --> 34:02.815
Simple math.

34:02.817 --> 34:04.334
Barrel weighs 500 pounds.

34:04.336 --> 34:07.153
Birdie weighs a quarter of that.

34:07.155 --> 34:10.368
Once barrel weighs less than birdie...

34:10.371 --> 34:12.347
Whoa! Ohh!

34:38.433 --> 34:39.449
Unh!

34:39.453 --> 34:41.402
Aah!

34:45.071 --> 34:46.871
No!

34:48.219 --> 34:50.428
Raah!

34:52.971 --> 34:54.980
Aah!

35:07.223 --> 35:09.389
You're...

35:09.392 --> 35:11.452
Not him.

35:53.589 --> 35:56.265
Mommy, look!

35:56.268 --> 35:58.319
It's Batman!

36:05.610 --> 36:07.569
Good morning, Gotham.

36:07.572 --> 36:09.522
Your girl Vesper Fairchild here.

36:09.525 --> 36:11.650
So was I dreaming,

36:11.653 --> 36:13.607
or is Batman really back?

36:13.610 --> 36:16.036
If so, things are
looking up for this city.

36:16.038 --> 36:19.812
If not, I just revealed way
too much about my dreams.

36:19.815 --> 36:22.138
Talk to me, Gotham. Are you as excited

36:22.141 --> 36:25.875
about Mr. Tall Dark
and Unavailable as I am?

36:25.878 --> 36:27.123
It was so cool,

36:27.126 --> 36:29.643
and then Batman flew into the sky

36:29.646 --> 36:32.096
and was swinging from buildings.

36:32.099 --> 36:34.536
See? I told you he'd be back.

36:34.539 --> 36:37.944
Dodgson and Alice are
Crows' priority number one.

36:37.947 --> 36:39.196
What about the Bat, sir?

36:39.199 --> 36:42.210
Oh, come on. Seen these wannabes before.

36:42.213 --> 36:43.755
He gets the city all hot and bothered,

36:43.757 --> 36:45.560
and then thanks to a
total lack of skill,

36:45.563 --> 36:49.114
he usually dies in some
spectacular fashion.

36:49.117 --> 36:50.400
He?

36:50.403 --> 36:52.721
Welcome back, Agent Moore.

36:52.724 --> 36:54.142
You say something?

36:54.145 --> 36:55.588
Not important, sir.

36:55.591 --> 36:58.152
All right. Let's find these two.

37:14.914 --> 37:17.790
Wouldn't drink that if I were you.

37:17.793 --> 37:22.689
It's toxic. Christmas
gift from Gotham police.

37:22.692 --> 37:24.966
Good to know.

37:24.969 --> 37:26.671
Hi, by the way.

37:26.674 --> 37:29.735
Hi. I heard you came back for me.

37:29.738 --> 37:31.110
Thanks.

37:31.113 --> 37:32.779
There she is. I thought we talked

37:32.782 --> 37:35.139
about never letting you
out of my sight again.

37:35.141 --> 37:39.120
I'm fine. Seriously, I'm good.

37:39.123 --> 37:40.936
Tyler, this is Kate.

37:40.939 --> 37:43.990
Kate, Tyler works for Crows International.

37:43.993 --> 37:45.358
Sorry to barge in,

37:45.360 --> 37:46.777
but, uh, got in late last night,

37:46.780 --> 37:50.918
and now I am that annoyingly
overprotective husband.

37:50.921 --> 37:53.022
You're married.

37:55.615 --> 37:57.999
Yeah.

37:58.002 --> 38:00.336
Congratulations.

38:00.339 --> 38:03.915
Nice to meet you, Tyler.

38:03.918 --> 38:07.428
I should probably go.

38:07.431 --> 38:09.565
See you, Sophie.

38:27.495 --> 38:29.853
Figured you'd left town.

38:35.326 --> 38:37.410
I want you to tell me that I was right.

38:37.412 --> 38:39.980
You were never going to make me a Crow.

38:42.541 --> 38:43.999
You're right.

38:44.002 --> 38:46.811
I never wanted you to be a Crow.

38:52.769 --> 38:55.636
The Military was my dream for you.

38:55.638 --> 38:58.573
I'd call in a favor, get you a desk job,

38:58.576 --> 39:00.487
a staff, and the occasional papercut

39:00.490 --> 39:02.923
would be the only
bloodshed you'd ever see.

39:02.926 --> 39:04.612
That wasn't my dream.

39:04.614 --> 39:09.859
No. No. You wanted to be in the action.

39:09.861 --> 39:12.479
That's why I didn't
want you to be a Crow...

39:12.482 --> 39:14.838
because I'm selfish

39:14.841 --> 39:18.009
and overly protective,

39:18.012 --> 39:20.679
and I'm terrified

39:20.682 --> 39:25.018
and because you're
all I have left, Kate,

39:25.021 --> 39:27.894
and I don't want to lose you, too.

39:31.641 --> 39:33.591
Look. This is all my way of saying

39:33.593 --> 39:37.864
that if... if you want
to be part of the team,

39:37.867 --> 39:39.915
you're in.

39:48.566 --> 39:51.425
KATE, VOICE-OVER: My dad
was running from his pain,

39:51.428 --> 39:53.401
but I was running, too,

39:53.404 --> 39:55.644
toward everything that didn't want me,

39:55.647 --> 39:57.434
a military academy,

39:57.437 --> 39:58.871
a private army,

39:58.874 --> 40:01.260
my own father.

40:01.263 --> 40:05.757
I spent 15 years searching
for a place I fit,

40:05.759 --> 40:08.343
and I think I've finally found it.

40:08.345 --> 40:11.271
Some see fear, others hope.

40:11.273 --> 40:13.965
I see the freedom to be myself,

40:13.967 --> 40:16.684
to play by own rules.

40:16.686 --> 40:19.980
I believe you're going to
come home one day, Bruce,

40:19.983 --> 40:21.885
and before you kill me for borrowing

40:21.888 --> 40:23.473
a few of your things,

40:23.476 --> 40:25.619
I want you to read my story

40:25.621 --> 40:28.108
because it's only just begun.

40:28.111 --> 40:30.793
Miss you, your cousin Kate.

40:34.296 --> 40:36.784
You know, for a minute there,

40:36.787 --> 40:39.296
really felt like he was home.

40:44.431 --> 40:46.163
Hey. Look. For what it's worth,

40:46.165 --> 40:48.475
Bruce never stopped looking

40:48.477 --> 40:50.489
for your sister's body.

40:50.492 --> 40:52.973
It is worth more than you think.

40:55.317 --> 40:58.989
Guy had the best tech on the planet.

40:58.992 --> 41:01.293
Why didn't he find her?

41:25.884 --> 41:27.943
Make sure our necklaces are in it.

41:34.251 --> 41:35.856
Beth.

41:40.553 --> 41:44.364
ALICE, THINKING: I'll win
you over, my dear sister.

41:44.366 --> 41:50.281
The two of us will rule Gotham together.
