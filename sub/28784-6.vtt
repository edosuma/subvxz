00:03.350 --> 00:04.830
MRS. BASKETS:
The new CEO

00:04.870 --> 00:06.830
of Baskets Rodeo.

00:06.870 --> 00:08.440
-[clapping]
-Thanks, everybody.
I appreciate that.

00:08.480 --> 00:11.310
-Hey, how did you kids
get in here?
-Shut up, old man.

00:11.350 --> 00:13.620
-Excuse me?
-DALE: The only lesson
that these kids understand

00:13.660 --> 00:15.490
is a cinder block
to the face.

00:16.530 --> 00:17.970
-Hey...
-Hear, hear. Cheers.

00:18.010 --> 00:19.840
You guys are partying
with minors.

00:19.880 --> 00:21.100
That is a Class A felony.

00:21.150 --> 00:23.240
You really think
I'm a good CEO?

00:23.280 --> 00:25.020
-Sure, you're a great CEO.
-Thanks, Dale.

00:28.890 --> 00:32.420
[high-pitched hum,
heartbeat pounding]

00:32.460 --> 00:36.340
NURSE [distant, echoing]:  Now just move your eyes slowly, left to right.

00:37.990 --> 00:41.120
Anything out of the ordinary?

00:41.170 --> 00:45.690
Any distortions?
Swirling sensations?

00:45.740 --> 00:47.260
Sir, just keep
moving your eyes, please.

00:47.300 --> 00:49.780
Mm, who is that over there?

00:49.830 --> 00:51.960
Oh, that's our clown.

00:52.000 --> 00:55.440
Okay. I don't see any reason
why you can't go home,

00:55.490 --> 00:57.270
I just wouldn't drive
for a couple days.

00:57.310 --> 00:59.360
Well, I don't drive.
What's with this clown?

00:59.400 --> 01:02.490
-Yeah?
-Is he a doctor?

01:02.540 --> 01:04.760
-No.
-He's not much of a clown,
either.

01:04.800 --> 01:07.110
NURSE:
Well, grief clowning
is a special skill.

01:07.240 --> 01:08.930
I mean, he's got a certificate.

01:08.980 --> 01:10.460
A certificate doesn't
mean anything

01:10.500 --> 01:12.890
when you're in
the clowning business.

01:12.940 --> 01:14.770
[quietly]:
Watch this.

01:14.810 --> 01:18.640
[makes bird noises]

01:22.380 --> 01:24.990
-Oh! Thanks!
-Yeah, no problem.

01:25.040 --> 01:27.600
Maybe I can come by
and give him some pointers,

01:27.650 --> 01:30.170
or maybe volunteer here,
I don't know.

01:30.220 --> 01:32.960
Oh, it's a paying job.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.180
-Paying job?
-Yeah.

01:35.220 --> 01:39.310
I used to clown professionally,but I'm a CEO now.

01:39.360 --> 01:42.490
-What-what are you doing?
-Oh, I was just looking
for my business card.

01:42.530 --> 01:45.320
Oh, uh, well, you're wearing
a hospital gown.

01:45.360 --> 01:47.580
That is true. Yeah.
Probably not in there.

01:47.620 --> 01:50.370
Yeah.
All righty, then.

01:51.320 --> 01:53.890
[phone ringing]

01:55.590 --> 01:57.290
Oh, hi, Chip.
How are you?

01:57.330 --> 01:58.500
Uh, listen.
Can you come pick me up

01:58.550 --> 01:59.720
at the hospital, please?

01:59.770 --> 02:02.250
Oh. Well, you know, honey,
I'm in Denver.

02:02.290 --> 02:03.770
I got a carpet emergency.

02:03.810 --> 02:07.080
Oh, gosh, I forgot
that you were in Denver.

02:07.120 --> 02:09.820
I probably forgot
'cause I got hit in the head.

02:09.860 --> 02:10.860
Oh, okay.
Well, feel better.

02:10.910 --> 02:13.300
Uh, well, don't forget
to feed the cats, honey.

02:13.350 --> 02:15.090
Okay.

02:15.130 --> 02:17.390
-Mom?
-Sorry, Chip. Got to go.

02:17.440 --> 02:18.870
-Mom!
-[phone beeps]

02:22.140 --> 02:25.310
[sighs]
I'm down here.

02:25.360 --> 02:28.580
The urn that is included
with the cremation

02:28.620 --> 02:33.100
is a hard... plastic shell.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.890
But if you'd like your father
to reside in something

02:35.930 --> 02:39.460
-a little more gracious...
-Um, that's okay.

02:41.460 --> 02:42.590
You're sure?

02:42.640 --> 02:44.460
My dad loved plastic.

02:44.510 --> 02:45.600
But how's that gonna look?

02:45.640 --> 02:49.380
Oh, I'm probably just gonna
keep it in the closet.

02:49.430 --> 02:50.600
That's fine.

02:50.640 --> 02:54.430
What are your plans
for the service?

02:54.470 --> 02:56.480
I haven't made any plans yet.

02:56.520 --> 02:58.220
This was pretty sudden.

02:58.260 --> 03:02.350
My dad fell off the roof
trying to fix the TV antenna.

03:02.390 --> 03:06.440
And, unfortunately, he fellbefore he could finish the job,

03:06.490 --> 03:09.050
-so it's still broken.
-Oh.

03:09.100 --> 03:11.270
Now I can't leave
my mom home alone,

03:11.320 --> 03:15.360
or she'llgo up on the roof
to try to fix the antenna.

03:15.490 --> 03:19.800
I got it.
I got it.

03:19.850 --> 03:24.070
Okay, well, um, I left my mom
at Costco temporarily,

03:24.110 --> 03:27.510
but I should really get back
to her as soon as possible.

03:27.550 --> 03:30.070
-Let's just finish this.
-Okay.

03:30.120 --> 03:33.080
-[phone ringing]
-Oh, it's Chip.

03:33.120 --> 03:35.080
-Hello?
-Hey, Martha, listen,
I need you to, uh...

03:35.120 --> 03:36.170
I'll do it.

03:36.210 --> 03:38.300
But you don't know what
I'm asking you to do.

03:38.340 --> 03:40.300
-[phone beeps off]
-Sir, I've got to go.

03:40.350 --> 03:42.700
I'll come back for my dad.

03:48.140 --> 03:50.400
Do you miss my clowning?

03:50.440 --> 03:51.660
Do I miss your clowning?

03:51.700 --> 03:54.580
Yeah, it's
a legitimate question.

03:54.710 --> 03:58.150
Um, not yet, I guess.

03:58.190 --> 04:00.370
'Cause I do.

04:00.410 --> 04:01.410
Hmm.

04:01.450 --> 04:06.150
You know, I've been listening
to, to those success tapes.

04:06.200 --> 04:07.550
The ones Tammy gave you?

04:07.590 --> 04:09.900
Well, let's not get mixed up
in the personalities, Martha.

04:09.940 --> 04:11.640
But let's just say
the system works.

04:11.680 --> 04:13.860
It-it, it does.

04:13.900 --> 04:16.209
-Okay.
-I do miss clowning.

04:16.250 --> 04:18.560
Something reminded me
of that today.

04:21.730 --> 04:23.350
Something?

04:23.390 --> 04:25.740
Yeah, something, Martha, yeah.

04:25.780 --> 04:27.960
I just-- I don't know,
I saw this clown,

04:28.000 --> 04:30.960
and I thought...

04:31.000 --> 04:32.960
maybe I should return
to clowning, you know?

04:33.010 --> 04:37.400
As-as a hobby. Just-just do it
for the joy of it.

04:37.530 --> 04:41.010
-Okay.
-You need to take a left
right here.

04:41.060 --> 04:43.230
Um, we have to stop
at Costco first.

04:43.280 --> 04:45.670
I ain't going
to no Costco, Martha.

04:45.720 --> 04:47.330
-MARTHA: Well, my mom's here.
-[Chip sighs loudly]

04:47.370 --> 04:50.370
CHIP:
Do you have a life
outside of Costco?

04:50.420 --> 04:52.590
MARTHA:
Sometimes I go to Sam's Club.

04:52.640 --> 04:55.420
Mom.

04:55.460 --> 04:56.940
I can eat ham.

04:56.990 --> 04:58.380
No one said you couldn't.

04:58.420 --> 05:00.730
-Would you like a sample?
-Oh, hey, Lorenzo.

05:00.770 --> 05:03.340
-No, thank you.
-I-I'll take some.I just got out of the hospital.

05:03.390 --> 05:04.820
Thank you.

05:04.860 --> 05:07.350
Okay, Mom,
let's get you home.

05:07.390 --> 05:08.780
Okeydokey.

05:08.830 --> 05:11.000
See you tomorrow.

05:11.040 --> 05:12.570
MARTHA:
Well, we'll see about that.

05:12.610 --> 05:14.270
Since my husband died,

05:14.310 --> 05:17.360
my daughter won't let me
stay home alone.

05:17.400 --> 05:20.840
Martha, your--
your dad died?

05:20.970 --> 05:24.010
You didn't tell me.

05:24.060 --> 05:25.360
Well...

05:25.410 --> 05:27.840
Oh, God, uh-- You okay?
Do-- Is this--

05:27.890 --> 05:29.060
I should hug you.
I'm gonna hug you, okay?

05:29.110 --> 05:30.500
I'm going in for a hug, here...

05:30.540 --> 05:33.420
-Okay. Well, ow, my cast.
-Okay, sorry.

05:33.460 --> 05:35.420
It just happened, Chip.

05:35.460 --> 05:38.380
We don't even know where
we're gonna have the services.

05:38.420 --> 05:39.940
[exhales] God...

05:39.990 --> 05:41.290
You're sad.
You must be sad.

05:41.340 --> 05:43.470
I'm sorry.
Uh, uh, I'm so sorry.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.040
All right, well, let me help.

05:45.080 --> 05:47.820
I-I, I can, uh, let me host it.I could, I could host it.

05:47.860 --> 05:49.430
Okay-- In your condo?

05:49.470 --> 05:52.390
In my con-- No, but there's a--there's a common room

05:52.430 --> 05:53.870
in my condo.
It's a great space.

05:53.910 --> 05:55.390
We could d-- we could
have it there.

05:55.440 --> 05:57.610
You think you could score it
for the wake?

05:57.660 --> 06:00.090
-Yeah. Yeah-yeah, absolutely.
No problem.
-Okay.

06:00.140 --> 06:02.230
All right.
Okay, Mom, let's go.

06:02.360 --> 06:04.180
Chip's gonna host the wake.

06:04.230 --> 06:06.620
Whoopie-do! [giggles]

06:06.670 --> 06:08.060
See you tomorrow.

06:08.100 --> 06:10.320
Well, we'll see
about that, okay?

06:10.370 --> 06:13.850
Can I get, uh,
seven of those to go?

06:30.340 --> 06:32.470
Yeah, come in.
You can come in.

06:32.520 --> 06:38.000
Hi. I'm, uh, I'm Chip Baskets.
I'm a condo...

06:38.040 --> 06:40.660
I'm a condo owner.

06:40.700 --> 06:42.270
And I'm Anita in Operations.

06:42.400 --> 06:46.270
Uh... I wanted to-to talk
to you, or to anybody

06:46.310 --> 06:50.540
about reserving
the, uh, common room.

06:50.580 --> 06:52.490
Um, yeah. Okay.

06:52.540 --> 06:54.540
You'd have to talk to David.

06:54.580 --> 06:59.240
-David?
-'Cause everything really
runs through... David.

06:59.280 --> 07:00.500
Oh, yeah, that's what they--

07:00.550 --> 07:02.980
Yeah, is he,
is he on the premises?

07:03.110 --> 07:05.070
He is around,
but he's in and out.

07:05.120 --> 07:08.070
And he's on the premises
of other premiseses

07:08.120 --> 07:09.730
in California.

07:09.770 --> 07:13.470
Um, so he just had a baby.

07:13.520 --> 07:14.560
-Okay.
-Mm-hmm.

07:14.600 --> 07:15.340
Well, luckily, you'rehere.

07:15.390 --> 07:17.340
-Well, I can't do anything.
-So...

07:17.390 --> 07:18.560
[chuckles] 'Cause I'm in sales.

07:18.610 --> 07:21.170
But could I put a request in
through you?

07:23.000 --> 07:24.130
Sure.

07:24.180 --> 07:28.140
I will put in a request
with David.

07:28.270 --> 07:29.530
-That sounds like a good plan.
-Right?

07:29.570 --> 07:31.490
Thank you very much. Great.

07:31.530 --> 07:35.620
If, uh, you need me,
I'll be in my unit.

07:35.670 --> 07:37.580
-Okay.
-Thank you.

07:37.630 --> 07:38.670
Mm-hmm.

07:41.760 --> 07:43.410
CHIP:
Okay, you guys are fed,

07:43.460 --> 07:47.680
I changed your litter box,
I gave you water.

07:47.720 --> 07:50.290
I think I'm gonna be on my way.

07:50.330 --> 07:52.600
-Mom!
-Chip!

07:52.640 --> 07:55.210
-What are you doing here?
-What happened to your neck?

07:55.250 --> 07:57.340
What do you mean?I called you from the hospital.

07:57.380 --> 08:00.340
Well, I didn't know
it was so serious, honey.

08:00.390 --> 08:01.780
Well, I'm-I'm totally fine.

08:01.820 --> 08:04.220
Oh, hi, kitties.

08:04.260 --> 08:05.520
What are,
what are you doing here?

08:05.570 --> 08:07.480
I thought there was
a carpet emergency.

08:07.610 --> 08:10.400
Well,
Martha's father died, honey.

08:10.440 --> 08:13.880
-I came right home.
-Yeah, I know, it's sad.

08:13.920 --> 08:15.620
Terrible.

08:15.660 --> 08:19.540
Honey, never let me go
on the roof in my 90s, okay?

08:19.580 --> 08:21.670
-What are you doing?
-I'm making a casserole

08:21.710 --> 08:23.540
for Martha's family.

08:23.590 --> 08:26.150
You know, when someone dies,
people get hungry.

08:27.810 --> 08:29.680
Well, I told Martha
that I would, uh, you know,

08:29.720 --> 08:31.680
try to throw a wake for her.

08:31.720 --> 08:35.250
Oh, well, that's really nice,
honey. What are you planning?

08:35.289 --> 08:39.340
You know, and I was
thinking about maybe...

08:39.380 --> 08:42.340
I don't know, dipping my toe
back into clowning

08:42.390 --> 08:45.560
and doing something,
you know, there.

08:45.610 --> 08:47.570
At a funeral?

08:47.610 --> 08:49.520
Yeah, grief clowning.
It's a, it's a specialty.

08:49.650 --> 08:50.920
-Oh.
-It's...

08:50.960 --> 08:52.790
You know, it makes
people feel better.

08:52.830 --> 08:54.350
But I thought you were happy

08:54.400 --> 08:56.360
being a CEO, honey.

08:56.400 --> 08:58.580
I am, I am, I am.
I just, you know,

08:58.620 --> 08:59.840
It's a performance itch,

08:59.880 --> 09:03.800
and maybe I just want to scratchthat itch at the funeral.

09:03.840 --> 09:06.280
Well, I guess I'd talk
to Daniel if I was you

09:06.320 --> 09:09.500
because he's always planning allthese memorials at the church.

09:09.540 --> 09:13.500
He'll tell you if being a clownat a wake is crazy or not.

09:13.550 --> 09:15.850
It's not crazy, Mom.

09:15.900 --> 09:17.600
Well...

09:18.680 --> 09:20.690
I'll talk to him.

09:20.730 --> 09:23.650
-You need some onions?
-Don't I.

09:23.690 --> 09:26.390
[birds singing, dog barking]

09:26.430 --> 09:28.430
When are we going to your work?

09:28.480 --> 09:30.700
I'm taking a bereavement day.

09:30.740 --> 09:35.530
If you're trying to get betweenme and the sample ham man,

09:35.570 --> 09:38.830
forget it. I like him.

09:38.880 --> 09:41.310
You don't even know his name.

09:41.360 --> 09:43.010
Lorenzo.

09:43.060 --> 09:46.490
-Okay, you're right.
-[doorbell rings,
knocking at door]

09:46.540 --> 09:48.800
Why do people keep showing up?

09:48.840 --> 09:51.590
My husband died.

09:53.500 --> 09:56.630
-Oh.
-Oh! Martha, I'm so sorry

09:56.680 --> 09:59.030
for your loss.
I brought you a casserole.

09:59.070 --> 10:00.810
Thanks, I'll put it
in the fridge.

10:00.860 --> 10:03.470
And don't worry about the pan,
get it back to me

10:03.510 --> 10:06.040
whenever you can. It doesn't
match my other ones anyways.

10:06.080 --> 10:08.470
It's a Le Creuset, though.

-There you are.

10:09.730 --> 10:12.610
-Darling, how are you?
-Oh, not so good.

10:12.740 --> 10:13.960
So sorry.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.480
I can't stand being
in this house anymore.

10:17.520 --> 10:18.920
All the memories, honey?

10:18.960 --> 10:21.140
-No TV.
-No TV.

10:21.180 --> 10:23.790
Well, let's sit and chat,
you know?

10:23.840 --> 10:25.880
MARTHA:
Don't sit there,
that's my dad's paperwork.

10:25.920 --> 10:29.150
Oh! Oh, geez, I'm sorry, Martha.

10:29.190 --> 10:32.670
-Sorry.
-Thanks, Mrs. Baskets.

10:32.710 --> 10:34.760
I appre-- Mom, stop.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.590
-Do not go on the roof.-What is she doing on the roof?

10:37.630 --> 10:41.810
She's trying to fix the TV. Mom.

[sighs] I'll take you to Costco.

Costco? Always a good fix
when you're not

10:48.560 --> 10:49.770

-Here we go.

Hey, Reverend Kwon?

11:02.740 --> 11:04.960
Oh, hey, Chip.

11:05.010 --> 11:07.970
Hey, uh, do you have a minute?

11:08.010 --> 11:08.710
Yeah.

11:08.750 --> 11:11.710
Um, I just wanted to say
that I'm really sorry

11:11.750 --> 11:14.190
about the other night
with those kids.

11:14.230 --> 11:17.800
I wasn't thinking,
and that's... I'm sorry.

11:17.850 --> 11:20.940
You coming here
and saying that...

11:20.980 --> 11:23.070
Jesus teaches us to forgive.

11:23.110 --> 11:25.070
That's all you had to do.

11:25.110 --> 11:27.200
Who's Jesus?

11:27.250 --> 11:30.730
Oh, oh, yeah, the guy from the--Yeah, the Bible guy. Yeah.

11:30.770 --> 11:33.860
Um, hey, listen... [stammers]
I wanted to ask your advice.

11:33.910 --> 11:35.950
I have to, uh,
perform a eulogy...

11:35.990 --> 11:37.740
-Cool.
-...at...

11:37.870 --> 11:39.080
Yeah, it is cool.

11:39.130 --> 11:41.130
And, uh, my mom says
you're the master at it.

11:41.170 --> 11:43.000
I mean, she may be
a little biased.

11:43.050 --> 11:44.000
She's kind of a fan, but...

11:44.050 --> 11:46.140
I think she has a crush
on you, actually.

11:46.180 --> 11:47.920
[laughing]:
Oh, come on, Chip.

11:47.960 --> 11:50.010
So I-I kind of came
to ask your advice.

11:50.050 --> 11:52.790
I have this eulogy
and I wanted to bring

11:52.840 --> 11:55.140
what I call my grief clowning

11:55.190 --> 11:57.800
to the, to the wake.

11:57.840 --> 12:01.020
Well, I always try to remember
that it's not about me, right?

12:01.060 --> 12:04.760
It-It's about the mourned
and-and the mourners.

12:04.810 --> 12:06.110
Yeah.

12:06.160 --> 12:09.030
But I have managed to get someenormous laughs over the years.

12:09.070 --> 12:10.810
-Hm.
-Is it open casket?

12:10.860 --> 12:13.030
No, I don't think so,
no, no, no.

12:13.080 --> 12:14.900
Yeah, gives you some leeway.

12:14.950 --> 12:17.780
Maybe you could come to the
service and check it out and

12:17.820 --> 12:20.170
-see what you think about it.
-Oh! Sure.

12:20.300 --> 12:21.820
Yeah? Would you do that?

12:21.870 --> 12:25.000
Yeah, you know what, y-y-yes,
I will. I-I-I will be there.

12:25.040 --> 12:26.700
You know where the
Bullet Train Apartments are?

12:26.740 --> 12:28.260
-Yes.-They're on Federalsburg Street.

12:28.310 --> 12:29.830
-Yeah, okay. Okay.
-Okay.

12:29.870 --> 12:32.440
All right, thanks, Kwon,
Reverend Kwon.

12:32.490 --> 12:34.440
You got the bath
and the closet...

12:34.490 --> 12:36.790
Sorry. Have you talked
to David yet?

12:36.840 --> 12:38.840
Um, not yet.

12:38.880 --> 12:41.020
They're not trying to get
the common room, are they?

12:41.060 --> 12:43.930
No, but if you did want to,you do need to go through David.

12:43.980 --> 12:45.850
Okay, you know what,
why don't we assume

12:45.890 --> 12:46.850
that David's gonna grant me

12:46.890 --> 12:48.890
-the common room...
-I'm so sorry.

12:48.940 --> 12:50.370
...and then you can
tentatively slot me in

12:50.420 --> 12:51.980
until maybe David vetoes it.

12:52.030 --> 12:53.900
Hey, Martha, I wanted
to let you know

12:53.940 --> 12:54.810
we have the common room.

12:55.990 --> 12:57.420
We have the common room.

12:57.470 --> 13:00.300
Oh, um, I didn't realize

13:00.430 --> 13:02.170
that we ever hadn't had it.

13:02.210 --> 13:05.080
We didn't didn't have it. We--
But I'm-I'm just saying

13:05.130 --> 13:07.830
we have it for sure,
it's carved in stone.

13:07.870 --> 13:09.480
Um, okay, thanks, Chip.

13:09.520 --> 13:13.090
Yes, exciting. It's beautiful.
Lot of square footage,

13:13.140 --> 13:15.920
uh, lights,
everything you need, couches.

13:15.960 --> 13:18.180
I fell in love
with clowning as a child,

13:18.230 --> 13:22.060
and, uh, actually, was formallytrained in-in-in France.

13:22.100 --> 13:25.970
I don't have any specific
grief clowning training,

13:26.020 --> 13:28.320
but I have a ton
of experience with grief

13:28.370 --> 13:29.500
in my own personal life.

13:29.540 --> 13:31.110
Mm.

13:31.150 --> 13:32.330
I'm actually performing
at a wake this weekend

13:32.370 --> 13:34.240
if you'd like to see me
showcase my talents.

13:34.290 --> 13:35.980
Uh, there'll be a lot
of grieving there.

13:36.030 --> 13:37.990
I mean, I'm-I'm-I'm hoping.

13:38.030 --> 13:40.860

Hey, Mrs. Brooks.

14:15.630 --> 14:17.900
Hey, any news on my dish?

You mean the pale blue one?

14:20.200 --> 14:23.030
-La Creuset.
-I thought you said it was

14:23.070 --> 14:24.380
no hurry getting it back to you.

14:24.510 --> 14:28.170
Well, no hurry doesn't mean
we lose our minds, Martha.

14:28.210 --> 14:29.120
Chip, talk to her.

14:29.170 --> 14:31.520
All right, no--
[exhales] Yeah, I will.

14:31.560 --> 14:34.170
All right. And then I gotta go
upstairs and change clothes.

14:34.220 --> 14:35.610

I don't care about the dish.

14:35.650 --> 14:37.000

14:49.750 --> 14:51.410
You were saying?

14:51.450 --> 14:55.590
And my mom is mad at me 'cause
I wouldn't let her invite

14:55.630 --> 14:58.200
the Hormel ham sample guy.

Martha, you got to stop
cockblocking your mom.

15:00.330 --> 15:01.330
She's grieving.

15:01.370 --> 15:02.940
And I don't know if this
is the best time for you

15:02.980 --> 15:05.070
to be going over
your dad's paperwork.

15:05.120 --> 15:09.030
Do you think I'm doing it
to avoid facing my feelings?

15:09.160 --> 15:10.950
I don't know.
Is that possible?

15:10.990 --> 15:13.390
Sounds like a good idea.

15:13.430 --> 15:15.650
Hey, listen, I wanted you
to know that I'm, uh,

15:15.690 --> 15:18.170
I'm gonna swing for the fences.

for your faith, Martha.

I'm gonna handle this.

Look what you did!

And all without David.

My fingerprints cannot be
anywhere near this. Okay?

-Okay.

this room open,

Okay, uh...

19:17.240 --> 19:18.670
[stammers]
Hurry this along.

19:18.800 --> 19:20.330
Um...

19:20.370 --> 19:22.330
Don't-don't come back here.

19:22.370 --> 19:26.030
-[children vocalizing]
-MRS. BASKETS: They're back.

19:26.070 --> 19:28.680
[playing along on kazoo]

19:30.080 --> 19:32.250
CHIP:
They're a little hyped up

19:32.300 --> 19:33.650
on hot chocolate, I think.

19:33.690 --> 19:35.820
-[scattered laughter]
-Okay, guys, thank you.

19:35.870 --> 19:36.820
Oh.

19:36.870 --> 19:38.350
-[applause]
-Oh. They like it.

19:38.390 --> 19:39.960
They like it. Bow, bow, bow.

19:42.260 --> 19:45.660
Okay, uh, and then
just maybe right back out.

19:45.700 --> 19:47.360
Here we go. There we go, gang.

19:47.400 --> 19:49.140
[Chip and kids vocalizing]

19:49.180 --> 19:51.230
-[playing along on kazoo]
-ANITA: Oh, David?

19:51.270 --> 19:54.360
Hi. Yeah, I've been trying
to call you over and over,

19:54.410 --> 19:55.670
but you were signed out.

19:55.710 --> 19:57.630
-Is that David?
-ANITA: Did you get the...

19:57.670 --> 20:00.460
Oh, yeah, you can...
you can use the room.

20:00.590 --> 20:02.630
-We have the room?
-For how long?

20:02.670 --> 20:04.850
Three...
three hours if you want.

20:04.890 --> 20:06.330
-MRS. BASKETS: Oh!
-We have the room!

20:06.370 --> 20:08.640
-We have three more hours. Okay.-MRS. BASKETS: The room!

20:08.680 --> 20:10.900
-We have the room.
-[sighs] What a relief.

20:10.940 --> 20:13.900
Now we can respect Mr. Brooks
the way he should be.

20:15.730 --> 20:18.910
MRS. BASKETS:
We raised $63.

20:19.740 --> 20:22.300
Great meeting y'all.

20:22.350 --> 20:24.480
Take care.

20:24.520 --> 20:26.870
That was a big success,
don't you think?

20:26.920 --> 20:28.000
It was...

20:28.050 --> 20:30.090
Oh, I thought
Chip was so terrific.

20:30.140 --> 20:34.970
It was very cool
and unusual and interesting.

20:35.010 --> 20:36.880
You liked it?

20:36.930 --> 20:39.490
I love the kids' conga.

20:39.540 --> 20:43.150
Yeah. I mean, when you work
with kids, you never know.

20:43.190 --> 20:46.680
You know, lot of wild card
situations there, but, uh...

20:46.720 --> 20:49.200
Yeah, it all worked out.

20:49.240 --> 20:52.290
I laughed. I never laugh.

20:52.330 --> 20:53.330
I've seen you laugh.

20:53.380 --> 20:54.900
Maybe I'm not aware of it.

20:54.940 --> 20:57.730
Chip, you're CEO,

20:57.770 --> 21:02.300
but maybe this is, you know...

21:02.340 --> 21:04.260
you.

21:06.130 --> 21:07.570
Thank you.

21:07.610 --> 21:08.780
DANIEL:
Well, anyway,

21:08.830 --> 21:10.570
got to run.
God bless. Thank you.

21:10.610 --> 21:12.090
-Thank you for letting me
be part of this.
-Bye.

21:12.140 --> 21:14.570
-See you in church.
-Okay.

21:14.620 --> 21:16.750
[Mrs. Baskets chuckles]

21:18.230 --> 21:19.800
Mom, you want
some hot chocolate?

21:19.840 --> 21:21.750
-It's really good.
-Oh, yes.

21:21.800 --> 21:23.710
Are there any tiny marshmallows?

21:23.760 --> 21:25.240
Yeah. How many you need?

21:25.370 --> 21:27.800
Oh, you know,
just fill it up, honey.

21:27.850 --> 21:29.460
BOY:
He started slow

21:29.500 --> 21:31.370
but sort of warmed up a bit.

21:31.420 --> 21:33.460
He got some scattered laughter.

21:33.500 --> 21:35.460
His makeup needed a little work,

21:35.510 --> 21:37.600
but his costume was decent.

21:37.640 --> 21:40.470
I'd be inclined to move him
to the next round.

21:40.510 --> 21:42.820
Okay. Thanks for helping.

21:42.860 --> 21:45.390
Ooh, candy. Yay.
