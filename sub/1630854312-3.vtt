26:41.766 --> 26:43.435
is carrying a dangerous disease.

26:43.518 --> 26:46.354
Okay, so we use the pipe
to get him from the airlock.

26:46.438 --> 26:48.648
-And what if he escapes?
-TV SARAH: Hang on!

26:48.732 --> 26:50.483
Wait for it.

26:50.567 --> 26:53.611
What if we put him inside
a big plastic ball?

26:54.988 --> 26:56.323
I totally agree.

26:56.865 --> 26:59.159
Fuck, yeah!

26:59.242 --> 27:02.620
-Hologram tech, baby.
-This is a game changer.

27:02.704 --> 27:04.873
Seriously,
I don't even recognize the game.

27:04.956 --> 27:07.083
(SIGHS) Decisions!

27:07.167 --> 27:09.044
God, it feels good
to finally get one right.

27:09.127 --> 27:12.714
Ryan, the ship's smart sensor
is showing we have a stowaway.

27:12.797 --> 27:15.050
-A what?
-Frank's cannibal

27:15.133 --> 27:16.509
is still on board.

27:16.593 --> 27:19.346
Oh, take me to hell
and toast my tits.

27:19.429 --> 27:21.014
Now, this is a teachable moment.

27:21.097 --> 27:22.265
You were so focused on the pedo,

27:22.349 --> 27:24.142
you forgot all about
the cannibal.

27:24.225 --> 27:26.102
Tale as old as time.

27:26.186 --> 27:28.563
So, I bring tools
for the eel tank.

27:29.189 --> 27:30.231

27:30.315 --> 27:31.858
