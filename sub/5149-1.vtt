00:54.000 --> 00:57.642
I spy with my little eye,
something beginning with Y.

00:57.682 --> 01:00.964
Yorkshire.
You can't SEE Yorkshire.

01:01.004 --> 01:04.285
Yellow.
I don't see anything yellow.

01:04.325 --> 01:09.608
Penny, these moors
have been inspiration for a lot
of great British artists.

01:10.649 --> 01:12.690
Maybe they'll be good for you, too.

01:19.733 --> 01:21.814
Look, kids!

01:21.854 --> 01:25.336
There's Heathcliff chasing Catherine
across the moor.

01:25.376 --> 01:27.737
I don't see anybody.

01:27.777 --> 01:30.219
Just a load of...empty.

01:46.867 --> 01:49.749
Creepy.
I think it looks nice.

01:49.789 --> 01:52.070
Wait till your mom's done with it.

01:52.110 --> 01:55.352
Rock stars and royalty
will be lining up around the block

01:55.392 --> 01:58.593
to get into one of Brad Mason's
parties. What block?

01:58.633 --> 02:02.795
All I see is green stuff.
It's only for six months.

02:02.835 --> 02:05.597
Six months?
I thought it was four months.

02:05.637 --> 02:07.798
It depends what I find.

02:07.838 --> 02:11.600
If there's woodworm and dry rot,
it could take longer.

02:15.362 --> 02:18.523
Come on!
We're going to enjoy ourselves.

02:18.564 --> 02:20.484
This is an adventure.

02:21.765 --> 02:24.527
An adventure that pays well.

02:24.567 --> 02:26.768
I'll drink to that.

02:49.179 --> 02:51.420
There it is!

02:59.264 --> 03:03.507
Who'd pay money to stay in a dump
like this?

03:03.547 --> 03:06.388
Come on. Let's get settled in.

03:14.352 --> 03:18.234
Mum, there's no signal. What kind
of hotel doesn't have bathrooms?

03:18.274 --> 03:20.475
It wasn't a hotel. It was a B&B.

03:20.515 --> 03:23.917
There's a bathroom down the hall.
Yeah, still!

03:26.238 --> 03:30.921
Is there no water? No. Sorry,
darling. I'll fix it tomorrow.

03:36.043 --> 03:37.484
Ooh!

03:40.005 --> 03:42.247
Budge up. Let me in.

03:49.050 --> 03:52.372
Think you're going to be able
to work here?

03:54.253 --> 03:56.414
I think I could work anywhere.

03:56.454 --> 04:00.416
But right now,
I just really want to go to sleep.

05:12.733 --> 05:14.414
Right.

05:23.018 --> 05:25.300
Three, two, one.

05:29.942 --> 05:34.624
Yeah. It's perfect.
What was it before? A games room.

05:34.664 --> 05:40.267
When it was built,
it was an artist's studio.
Radcliffe had an artist?

05:40.307 --> 05:43.789
No. Radcliffe WAS an artist,
a landscape painter.

05:43.829 --> 05:49.272
Shouldn't wonder,
with all this landscape lying about.
It's not too late to join the fun.

05:49.312 --> 05:53.314
I'd get crazy up here. When has
that been bad for an artist? True.

05:53.354 --> 05:56.636
Perhaps you'll make something
worth selling.

05:56.676 --> 05:58.076
What?

05:58.116 --> 05:59.997
And ruin my marriage?

06:01.198 --> 06:04.840
Is she all right?
She has a broken jaw.

06:04.880 --> 06:07.081
The car's a write-off.
Jesus!

06:07.121 --> 06:10.403
It could be serious.
They want to do a brain scan.

06:10.443 --> 06:15.605
I'm sorry, Meg. I can't leave her.
Maybe you could get Tony to help?

06:15.645 --> 06:18.767
But Tony's on a build in Scotland.

06:18.807 --> 06:23.449
Look, they're calling me back.
What about that Italian guy?

06:23.490 --> 06:25.651
Can you hear me? Frank?

07:33.365 --> 07:36.647
Greg left. Couldn't get out of here
fast enough.

07:39.689 --> 07:42.730
Is everything all right?
Celia's had a car accident.

07:42.770 --> 07:44.891
God! Is she all right?
Yeah.

07:44.931 --> 07:48.533
But Frank's got to look after her.
What are you going to do?

07:48.573 --> 07:51.695
I don't know.
I'll...find a local guy?

07:52.615 --> 07:55.457
Can you help me with something?

07:57.418 --> 07:59.619
It must be nailed shut.

07:59.659 --> 08:02.220
What's in there?

08:02.260 --> 08:05.902
I've no idea, but from the skylight,
it's worth a look.

08:07.023 --> 08:09.544
That's it. Nearly there.

08:12.866 --> 08:16.348
Ooh. Are you all right?
Yeah. It's just a nick.

08:16.388 --> 08:20.350
I'm all right.
Come on. After three.

08:21.710 --> 08:23.511
Two, three!

08:25.993 --> 08:27.994
Ooh!

08:30.315 --> 08:33.797
What do you think this place was?
I have no idea!

08:35.837 --> 08:37.999
It's not on any of the plans.

08:38.039 --> 08:40.039
I wonder why.

08:59.210 --> 09:01.131
What are you going to do with it?

09:01.171 --> 09:05.093
Turn it into a playroom
for one of Brad's kids?

09:07.134 --> 09:10.015
I have a feeling
this house is full of surprises.

09:12.496 --> 09:14.898
What the hell is that?

09:14.938 --> 09:16.619
Wow!

09:16.659 --> 09:20.100
Right. I've got a builder to find.

09:39.630 --> 09:42.272
I'm looking for Mr Donnelly.

09:46.914 --> 09:50.076
Sean Donnelly?
I'm not available.

09:50.116 --> 09:53.157
I've come about a long-term job.
Radcliffe.

09:53.197 --> 09:55.719
Yeah. Wow. How do you know that?

09:55.759 --> 09:59.241
You're the American banker's
designer from London.

09:59.281 --> 10:04.843
Why do I get the feeling
you don't approve? I don't mind
who lives in that house.

10:04.883 --> 10:07.645
I just don't want
to turn it into Disneyland.

10:07.685 --> 10:12.607
That's not what we're doing.
Is it true he hasn't set foot
in the place?

10:12.647 --> 10:14.768
That he bought it on the internet?

10:14.809 --> 10:18.410
He doesn't want to see it
until it's fully restored.

10:18.450 --> 10:21.932
Many of those skills are long gone,
Miss...?

10:21.972 --> 10:24.013
Hamilton, Meg.

10:26.815 --> 10:29.256
What do you know
about Yorkshire stone?

10:29.296 --> 10:33.818
I know that if you try and fix a
bronze dial plate by F Baker & Sons

10:33.858 --> 10:38.181
to a Mark Blanchard pedestal
using hydrated cement paste

10:38.221 --> 10:40.662
it'll probably corrode
in three years.

10:40.702 --> 10:44.544
You need to use lime mortar
and a French binding agent.

10:45.624 --> 10:47.866
If you want it to last.

10:52.828 --> 10:55.069
Mrs Hamilton?

11:13.959 --> 11:16.000
! Sorry!

11:16.040 --> 11:17.961
I'm doing laps.
What the hell?

11:18.001 --> 11:20.242
Harper, can you...?

11:28.206 --> 11:31.248
What is that horrible thing?
It's a fountain.

11:31.288 --> 11:34.449
It used to live outside the back
of the house.

11:34.490 --> 11:37.771
It won't be horrible
once you've cleaned it up. No, Mum.

11:37.811 --> 11:41.253
I've got books to read for school.

12:08.587 --> 12:10.068
Mum? Mm-hm.

12:10.108 --> 12:12.829
Have a look.
What is it?

12:12.869 --> 12:15.150
Come and see this.

12:15.791 --> 12:17.432
What?

12:18.352 --> 12:20.713
What is that?

12:20.753 --> 12:25.396
I don't know. It's a flare
or a reflection or something.

12:26.516 --> 12:28.517
No. It looks like...

12:28.557 --> 12:30.919
Is that a ghost?

12:30.959 --> 12:33.480
Woooo

12:33.520 --> 12:36.681
Knock twice
if you can hear me!

12:39.883 --> 12:42.645
Blow it up on your screen.
Don't touch my...

12:42.685 --> 12:44.526
OK. Sorry.

12:44.566 --> 12:47.807
What do you want to look at?
The picture.

12:55.571 --> 12:59.973
Now I don't see anything.
How can it be there and not here?

13:00.014 --> 13:03.655
I don't know. Printer's screwed.
It's a rubbish printer.

13:03.695 --> 13:06.537
Maybe it's a different picture.
It's not! Look!

13:06.577 --> 13:08.658
It's the only one I took.

13:08.698 --> 13:11.539
See? Nothing there.

13:11.579 --> 13:14.461
Come on. Let's get some lunch.
I'm starving.

13:14.501 --> 13:17.182
And you should be doing
differential calculus!

13:17.222 --> 13:20.544
OK.
It's nothing. It's in your head.

16:04.108 --> 16:06.229
Mrs Hamilton?

16:07.910 --> 16:11.312
Donnelly. I knocked.
Figured you couldn't hear me.

16:11.352 --> 16:14.554
Yeah. Thanks for coming.
You did want me here at four?

16:14.594 --> 16:17.675
Yes, yes. Sorry, I was miles away.

16:17.715 --> 16:19.716
What have you found?

16:20.237 --> 16:23.638
I don't know.
I think it's a bricked-up doorway.

16:23.678 --> 16:27.520
That would have been the root cellar
when the house was built.

16:27.560 --> 16:32.203
People closed them up when fridges
came in. OK. Give me a second.

16:32.243 --> 16:34.924
I'm just going to patch this up.

16:34.964 --> 16:39.006
I can only do three days a week
and my lad even less.

16:39.046 --> 16:41.808
Well, I'll take what I can get.

16:46.010 --> 16:50.772
I think we should start at the top
of the house and work our way down.

16:50.812 --> 16:57.376
As I said,
my client wants to see the place
returned to its original state.

16:57.416 --> 17:01.338
I think we might get away
with mostly decorative work...

17:12.502 --> 17:14.825
What was that?

17:15.865 --> 17:19.987
It's just the boiler.
Are you sure that's what it was?

17:23.309 --> 17:27.590
It's not going to do that all night?
Can you go check, Dad?

17:27.631 --> 17:30.993
Your mum wears the plumber's pants
in this house, sweetie.

17:39.397 --> 17:41.438
Ooh!
Where do you think you're going?

17:41.478 --> 17:43.719
I'm going to shut down
the bloody boiler.

17:43.759 --> 17:46.521
I'm not finished with you yet.

18:12.694 --> 18:14.095
Jesus!

20:10.355 --> 20:13.677
That felt great!
You had a shower?

20:13.717 --> 20:18.119
Piping hot and great pressure.
I've got to hand it to you, Meg.

20:18.159 --> 20:20.280
I turned the boiler off.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.961
Yeah. Very funny

20:23.001 --> 20:27.164
I...thought I saw a woman
wandering around the garden.

20:27.204 --> 20:31.486
Probably a nosy neighbour curious
about the aliens from London.

20:31.526 --> 20:33.887
Maybe I'm just tired.

21:06.064 --> 21:08.265
Do you know what I think?

21:08.305 --> 21:12.267
I think that you're more beautiful
now than when we first met.

21:13.467 --> 21:15.949
I don't believe you.

21:16.949 --> 21:19.030
Why?

21:20.551 --> 21:24.073
I think you wish...
I'd never cut my hair.

21:39.321 --> 21:43.203
I'm obviously not the woman
you fell in love with, Alec.

21:45.084 --> 21:47.765
I don't know what's happened to her.

21:48.806 --> 21:51.647
This is your moment.

21:53.888 --> 21:56.449
You're perfect as you are now.

21:57.570 --> 21:59.491
But that's not ME.

22:26.545 --> 22:28.226
Mm.

22:37.230 --> 22:38.751
Mm.

24:02.794 --> 24:05.756
Get your fucking hands off me!

24:22.445 --> 24:24.886
Get away!

24:27.407 --> 24:30.649
Get away, Alec, please!

24:31.369 --> 24:32.930
No!

24:34.291 --> 24:35.932
Stop it!

26:32.912 --> 26:35.313
Penny?

26:35.353 --> 26:37.434
Penny, the door's locked.

26:39.275 --> 26:43.317
The key must have dropped out.
Can you see it on the floor?

26:44.998 --> 26:47.719
Penny? Have you got your inhaler?

26:48.760 --> 26:50.801
Shit!

27:00.166 --> 27:02.167
I'm coming!

27:04.328 --> 27:05.729
Coming!

27:11.371 --> 27:13.252
Shit!

27:14.853 --> 27:17.174
Penny, stand clear.

27:21.137 --> 27:23.258
Where's your inhaler?

27:26.980 --> 27:28.901
Here we go.

27:32.222 --> 27:34.263
Exhale...and in.

27:34.303 --> 27:36.745
Big one. Good girl. And again.

27:38.585 --> 27:40.707
And breathe in. There we go.

27:40.747 --> 27:43.588
Let the medicine work. Good girl.

27:43.628 --> 27:47.830
Deep breath. You're OK.

27:47.870 --> 27:51.992
There was a woman.
She...was here with me.

27:52.032 --> 27:54.874
No. That's just a bad dream.
No, it's not.

27:57.035 --> 27:59.356
What's happening?

27:59.396 --> 28:02.518
Don't worry.
She just had an asthma attack.

28:02.558 --> 28:06.720
Go back to bed, darling. No way.
I'm sleeping in your bed now.

28:06.760 --> 28:09.641
Are you OK?

28:46.180 --> 28:49.022
So, who wants to go
to the beach today?

28:50.302 --> 28:53.464
There's a town called Whitby,
not far from here.

28:53.504 --> 28:55.505
That's where Dracula landed.

28:55.545 --> 28:58.867
They put him in a coffin because
the sunlight burnt his skin.

28:58.907 --> 29:02.789
Shut up, Harper. It was the centre
of the creepy universe.

29:12.434 --> 29:16.036
Since when do you work all night?
I'm on the brink of something.

29:16.076 --> 29:18.677
Where's the tea? We don't have tea.

29:19.197 --> 29:24.080
Don't tell me you forgot the tea?
No. We don't drink it.
There's coffee on the stove.

29:25.280 --> 29:27.882
Penny saw a ghost.
What?

29:27.922 --> 29:32.884
She had a nightmare. She got
wound up and had an asthma attack.

29:33.845 --> 29:37.086
It was a real fucking ghost.
Penny!

29:37.126 --> 29:40.288
What kind of language is that,
young lady?

29:41.929 --> 29:45.451
It's the language of a girl
who's been neglected by her father,

29:45.491 --> 29:49.213
which is why you're taking them
to the bloody seaside today.

29:49.253 --> 29:51.254
Today's no good.

29:53.095 --> 29:54.255
Alec!

29:56.336 --> 30:00.458
Alec, we agreed you'd look after
the kids till they start school.

30:00.498 --> 30:03.020
And I will. Just not today.

30:03.060 --> 30:06.422
I'm in the middle of something.
I'm very pleased for you.

30:06.462 --> 30:09.703
And you can pick it up
when they start school next week.

30:09.743 --> 30:13.025
This isn't something
you can pick up and drop off.

30:20.669 --> 30:25.111
It's important that you position it
in line with the study window.

30:26.152 --> 30:30.354
Ten yards from the house.
It's this distance here.

30:58.808 --> 31:03.011
There were cuts and scars
up her arms. I didn't dream it, Mum.

31:03.051 --> 31:06.452
I know it must seem like that,
but sometimes we can't tell.

31:06.492 --> 31:08.614
Then why was the door locked?

31:08.654 --> 31:12.456
Penny, the door doesn't have a lock.
The door was jammed.

31:12.496 --> 31:15.937
Jammed?
Old houses move over time.

31:15.977 --> 31:18.098
Things stick.

31:19.939 --> 31:23.541
You know Emily? Her uncle bought
this place which was haunted.

31:23.581 --> 31:26.543
He got this guy
who sorted it out in one visit.

31:26.583 --> 31:29.784
Have you been Tweeting about this?
We've got to do something.

31:29.824 --> 31:32.946
It's not a priest. He just says
he was born with a gift.

31:32.986 --> 31:35.667
My God! You've contacted him.
No, Mum.

31:35.707 --> 31:39.309
Emily sent me his home page so
we could check him out. Let me see.

31:41.871 --> 31:44.312
You've got to be kidding.
He's super-discreet.

31:44.352 --> 31:48.754
Promise me that you won't talk
about this online any more. Mum!

31:48.794 --> 31:51.956
This is my work you're dissing,
Penny!

31:51.996 --> 31:54.157
I'm going to get a reputation.

33:23.763 --> 33:28.085
Fix yourselves some lunch.
I'm going to check on the guys.

33:31.087 --> 33:33.168
Donnelly!

33:39.691 --> 33:41.692
"Sorry we missed you."

33:54.339 --> 33:56.940
What happened?
We have a little problem.

33:59.782 --> 34:02.183
Wow!

34:03.343 --> 34:07.826
My lad's not normally superstitious.
Neither am I.

34:07.866 --> 34:13.708
But we thought, with the history
of the place and all,
you'd want to keep it covered.

34:13.748 --> 34:16.670
I thought you understood.

34:14.909 --> 34:18.751
The history of the place is
exactly what we're here to restore.

34:21.473 --> 34:24.034
Then I'm afraid you're on your own.

34:28.156 --> 34:31.757
Why is it such a big deal?
I've got a reputation, Mrs Hamilton.

34:31.797 --> 34:34.239
Small,
but enough to keep me in work.

34:34.279 --> 34:38.802
If word spread that Sean Donnelly
invited the wrong publicity,
I'll lose my business.

34:38.842 --> 34:43.684
What kind of publicity? There are
rumours that Radcliffe built
the place as a sort of temple.

34:43.724 --> 34:47.166
It was so long ago, thankfully,
it's all they are - rumours.

34:47.206 --> 34:49.687
Now I'm not so sure.
It's just a work of art.

34:49.726 --> 34:52.849
No. It's a work of the devil.
That is ridiculous!

34:52.889 --> 34:56.650
Is it? He killed his wife
in some sort of ritual.

34:56.690 --> 35:01.573
She haunted him day and night until
he threw himself from the window.

35:01.613 --> 35:07.336
If I were you, I'd persuade
your American banker to tear it down
and start from scratch.

35:20.903 --> 35:23.745
You've been in there all day?

35:23.785 --> 35:27.667
How was the beach?
You missed the phone engineer.

35:27.707 --> 35:30.828
I'm sorry, babe.
Can you stop walking away from me?

35:30.868 --> 35:34.350
I'm trying to talk to you.
Alec, this is important.

35:34.390 --> 35:39.913
Donnelly's just quit.
I've got to find someone else.
I really need you to pitch in.

35:39.953 --> 35:44.435
Would you sit for me? This
is serious. A couple of sessions.

35:44.475 --> 35:47.637
I can't do this on my own!
I'm in the thick of it, Meg.

35:47.677 --> 35:51.999
Look, this is our pay cheque. OK?
It's our only pay cheque.

35:52.039 --> 35:56.402
Since your last show, we don't have
any money. I understand all that.

35:56.442 --> 36:00.003
But what I'm doing
will change our lives for ever.

36:01.084 --> 36:04.366
Alec, I'm really glad for you
that you found something new,

36:04.406 --> 36:07.767
but right now,
I just need your help.

36:07.807 --> 36:09.288
OK.

36:09.328 --> 36:11.169
OK?

36:14.051 --> 36:15.531
OK.

36:15.571 --> 36:16.972
Thanks.

36:17.012 --> 36:18.653
Really?

36:20.894 --> 36:23.776
I'll set aside some time
in the afternoons.

38:42.007 --> 38:44.208
Thank God!

39:37.275 --> 39:38.996
Hello?

39:39.036 --> 39:42.278
Is that you, petal?
Who is this?

39:50.162 --> 39:52.723
Agh! Agh! God!

39:56.045 --> 39:58.926
! You scared me.

40:01.007 --> 40:03.689
What are you doing in here?

40:03.729 --> 40:07.571
Well, I... I just...
I was answering the phone.

40:07.611 --> 40:11.093
I guess the engineer
must have connected it, after all.

40:11.133 --> 40:14.654
Phone?
You didn't hear the phone?

40:17.296 --> 40:19.977
Listen, I don't think
we should leave this light.

40:20.017 --> 40:22.899
Did you put this light on?
No. I thought you did.

40:24.860 --> 40:26.861
OK. Let's get out of here.

40:40.228 --> 40:42.469
Let's not do this in here.

40:42.509 --> 40:44.870
Can we go upstairs?

40:49.993 --> 40:54.075
Alec, can we go up? This room
really gives me the creeps.

40:54.115 --> 40:56.516
I don't like it in here. No!

40:56.556 --> 40:58.477
Alec, please, no!

40:58.517 --> 41:00.918
I don't like it here, please!

41:00.958 --> 41:03.360
Please, Alec. No.

41:05.881 --> 41:07.642
I don't like it.

41:27.292 --> 41:29.853
Hi. Thanks for coming back.

41:29.893 --> 41:32.174
Just through there.

41:35.496 --> 41:37.377
On the table at the end.

41:37.417 --> 41:41.259
Unless that's been converted to
digital, it's never going to work.

41:41.299 --> 41:44.901
It was working last night,
but dead again this morning.

41:46.982 --> 41:51.144
Well, I can't see how
that's possible. It's not connected.

41:51.184 --> 41:54.466
I can't even see
a telephone socket down there.

41:56.027 --> 41:57.227
Madam?

42:03.350 --> 42:05.271
OK. Let's go.

43:53.527 --> 43:55.768
Absolutely, Bradley. Yeah.

43:55.808 --> 43:59.890
Not only are we on schedule, we're
also finding some amazing stuff!

43:59.930 --> 44:02.932
Great.
Many original features are intact.

44:02.972 --> 44:06.013
Which is why, I imagine,
you wanted to buy it.

44:06.054 --> 44:08.135
I didn't buy it. I inherited it.

44:08.175 --> 44:11.136
Inherited it?
Yeah. I thought you knew that. No.

44:11.176 --> 44:15.779
The will showed up after 150 years,
buried in some trust somewhere.

44:15.819 --> 44:19.180
The original owner had a sister -
my great-great aunt.

44:19.220 --> 44:21.341
You just discovered that?
Yeah.

44:21.381 --> 44:25.103
I guess Victorian paperwork
was not all it's cracked up to be.

44:25.143 --> 44:29.105
The only condition was that it's
maintained in its original state.

44:29.145 --> 44:35.229
All I need to do is to get
the executor to check your work
and they'll sign over the deeds.

44:35.269 --> 44:38.190
What will you do with it?
Sell it. Keep up the good work!

44:53.758 --> 44:55.439
Hello?

44:57.560 --> 44:59.123
Hello?

45:02.811 --> 45:08.021
I believe you found artwork
of historical interest in the house.

45:08.061 --> 45:10.266
I'm sorry. You are...?

45:11.869 --> 45:13.873
Charles Kendrick Walker.

45:17.440 --> 45:21.809
I've always wondered
about this place.
You've been talking to Donnelly?

45:21.849 --> 45:23.813
I'd love to take a peak.

45:23.853 --> 45:27.581
We're not open to the public.
You misunderstand, Mrs Hamilton.

45:27.621 --> 45:31.749
I'm somewhat of an expert
on the era. I may be able to help.

45:31.789 --> 45:34.154
I don't need any help, thank you.

45:34.194 --> 45:37.120
Word spreads pretty fast round here.

45:37.160 --> 45:39.725
Good as well as bad.

45:39.765 --> 45:42.050
If we can dispel superstition,

45:42.090 --> 45:46.819
encourage people to regard Radcliffe
with fascination, rather than fear,

45:46.859 --> 45:50.507
we may be able to restore it
to the status it deserves.

45:51.709 --> 45:56.038
I'm a historian, Mrs Hamilton.
Believe me, you need my expertise.

46:01.409 --> 46:03.653
Good heavens!

46:03.693 --> 46:07.421
The glass is 1860, but I think
the design is a lot earlier.

46:07.461 --> 46:10.587
It goes back to the ancients.
You know what it is?

46:10.627 --> 46:12.832
A map of the human soul.

46:12.872 --> 46:16.679
Rosicrucians call it
the Emerald Tablet of Hermes.

46:16.720 --> 46:18.964
Radcliffe was an alchemist?

46:19.004 --> 46:21.249
Yes. A very good one.

46:23.173 --> 46:26.940
What happened here? I guess somebody
didn't like her face.

46:26.980 --> 46:30.908
The glass was shattered. It must
have been hit with something hard.

46:30.948 --> 46:33.794
Will you be able to restore it?

46:33.834 --> 46:36.880
If I can find out
what she looked like, yes.

46:36.920 --> 46:40.688
There's a painting at the Victorian
Museum of Art in Leeds.

46:40.728 --> 46:47.221
Radcliffe was a landscape artist,
but he left one portrait
of his wife, Isabella.

46:47.261 --> 46:50.868
This amazing illumination
features in the background.

46:50.908 --> 46:52.592
Great.

46:52.632 --> 46:54.836
I'll check it out.

46:54.876 --> 46:59.967
There would have been an effigy
of the Hermetic ray hanging over
the tablet.

47:00.007 --> 47:02.171
The altar.

47:04.736 --> 47:07.903
Will you be restoring the house
to its original state?

47:07.943 --> 47:12.111
Yes. That's the plan.
Not really sure what to do
with this room, though.

47:12.151 --> 47:15.157
Do? You said you were going
to restore it.

47:16.640 --> 47:20.528
My employer doesn't really
have a use for a Rosicrucian altar.

47:22.091 --> 47:25.017
And then there are the rumours
around town.

47:25.057 --> 47:28.785
These are simple folk, Mrs Hamilton.

47:28.825 --> 47:33.314
The miracle of metempsychosis is not
something they would understand.

47:33.354 --> 47:35.879
But Radcliffe did kill his wife?

47:38.003 --> 47:40.368
It was an accident.

47:40.408 --> 47:43.374
He loved her more than life itself.

47:45.579 --> 47:48.625
Why don't you meet my husband?

47:48.665 --> 47:51.791
I'm afraid I'm a little pushed
for time.

47:51.831 --> 47:54.958
You will put in a good word for us
in town?

47:57.042 --> 47:59.286
I'll do my best.

48:04.256 --> 48:08.184
I think that was a tie!

48:10.028 --> 48:12.192
Hi. Is there anything to eat?

48:12.232 --> 48:17.764
There are cold cuts in the fridge
and there's that bread you like.
Can you grab something?

48:17.804 --> 48:22.253
"Hi, Pen. How was your bike ride?"
Internet's working.

48:48.265 --> 48:50.590
My God! That's her!

48:50.630 --> 48:54.397
The woman in my room! That's her!
It's just some stupid picture.

48:54.438 --> 48:58.686
Why were you looking at that?
It came up when I was researching.

48:58.726 --> 49:01.933
Mum, that is definitely her.
Penny, calm down.

49:01.973 --> 49:04.899
Look, it's very common.
It's like a deja vu.

49:04.939 --> 49:10.871
When you're tired and stressed,
you feel like you've seen someone
in a dream and you haven't.

49:10.911 --> 49:14.237
I promise you! That is the woman
with the cuts up her arm!

49:14.278 --> 49:18.566
You said she was looking out the
window. Yes. How can you be sure?

49:18.606 --> 49:22.614
She looked at me. I saw her face!
Please, we've got to leave now.

49:22.654 --> 49:24.859
Please!
What's going on?

49:24.899 --> 49:29.308
Can you go? I'll be up in a minute.
What have I done wrong now?

49:29.348 --> 49:32.154
Just go upstairs now,
please!

49:33.436 --> 49:36.562
Listen, Penny, I know you're upset.

49:36.603 --> 49:42.254
If you're really not happy here,
I could try and organise for you
to live with Grandpa in London.

49:42.294 --> 49:46.022
Would you like to do that
for a couple of months? No, Mum.

49:46.062 --> 49:48.827
Please, we have to all leave
right now.

49:48.867 --> 49:51.032
I can't leave.

49:51.072 --> 49:55.761
I have to finish this job. We need
the money. Try and understand, OK?

49:55.801 --> 49:58.887
I've fixed the hot water.
I'll run you a nice hot bath.

49:58.928 --> 50:05.661
We'll all snuggle down
in the bed together
and watch a movie on the iPad, yeah?

50:05.701 --> 50:08.707
Something, you know, like a comedy.

50:19.970 --> 50:23.257
Was it Reverend Green in the cellar
with the lead pipe?

50:25.461 --> 50:27.706
Who's that?

50:38.086 --> 50:41.133
May I help you?
Nigel Lean at your service.

50:41.173 --> 50:43.578
This the old spooky pile?

50:43.618 --> 50:47.425
God! You're the ghost whisperer,
aren't you?

50:47.465 --> 50:52.195
This is Bessie. I'm terribly sorry.
There's been a misunderstanding.

50:52.235 --> 50:54.399
I know... Mum?

50:56.243 --> 50:58.528
At least show him round, OK?

51:03.377 --> 51:06.303
So, you're a plumber as well?

51:06.343 --> 51:10.311
A man's got to make a living.
I'd have thought exorcism...

51:10.352 --> 51:14.279
I don't charge for my cleansing
work. There's rules about that.

51:14.320 --> 51:16.364
But I will take a cup of coffee.

51:16.404 --> 51:19.851
Don't tell me. Milk and two sugars?
You're psychic, Mrs H

51:22.175 --> 51:26.504
It kind of looked like a smudge,
but there was definitely a figure.

51:26.544 --> 51:30.632
And then, the other night
I was going to bed and...

51:30.672 --> 51:34.520
My mum says it was a dream
but I saw this woman.

51:35.923 --> 51:38.047
Here we are.

51:38.087 --> 51:44.661
I should just explain,
my husband and I don't believe
in ghosts or spirits, Mr Lean.

51:44.701 --> 51:48.669
No-one does, Mrs H, till
they experience one first hand.

51:48.709 --> 51:50.873
Are you feeling one right now?

51:50.913 --> 51:53.478
The house has a very strong aura.

51:53.519 --> 51:55.643
No doubt about it.

52:04.060 --> 52:06.344
Can I take a look around?

52:06.384 --> 52:09.110
As long as you don't break anything.

52:26.265 --> 52:28.549
Been cooking, have we?

52:45.263 --> 52:46.826
Mm!

52:47.628 --> 52:50.634
Yep. That's some psychotic pharmacy.

52:50.674 --> 52:53.439
What?
It's a nasty red potion.

52:53.479 --> 52:55.604
Takes a while to kick in.

52:55.644 --> 52:59.732
Word of caution - be very careful
what you drink. Understood?

53:01.496 --> 53:04.502
OK, that's it.
Upstairs, both of you.

53:04.542 --> 53:07.508
Mum...! No!
I've heard enough. Upstairs!

53:07.548 --> 53:13.199
He said we could watch!
We're leaving Mr Lean
to find his own way out.

53:13.239 --> 53:15.364
Please let him do the cleansing.

53:15.404 --> 53:18.129
He's not helping.
He's spooking us, that's all.

54:35.204 --> 54:39.373
I'm sorry, Mr Lean. I can't have you
scaring the kids like that.

54:43.421 --> 54:46.427
Is something wrong?
He's still here.

54:47.750 --> 54:51.838
Who? It's not safe.
He wants to take over, take control.

54:53.121 --> 54:58.411
You're not making any sense.
He was a painter. He died
on that fountain from the fall.

54:58.451 --> 55:01.698
My God! Radcliffe.
Penny, go upstairs, please.

55:01.738 --> 55:04.985
No, not Radcliffe.
His name was different.

55:05.025 --> 55:07.470
Walker, I think.

55:07.510 --> 55:10.916
I'll leave you this,
in case of anything untoward.

55:10.957 --> 55:14.524
Basically, it's holy water
with a few add-ons. It's pukka.

55:14.564 --> 55:16.889
OK. Goodbye, Mr Lean.

55:16.929 --> 55:19.935
There's something else,
a feeling I picked up.

55:19.975 --> 55:23.342
I've never quite...
You have to be careful.

55:23.382 --> 55:27.390
What do you mean, careful?
He loved her, that's the problem.

55:27.430 --> 55:31.879
He loved her too much and now...
he wants to take control.

55:31.919 --> 55:36.809
Control of what? The house?
No, no. Not the house. Of you.

55:40.376 --> 55:43.662
Goodbye, Mr Lean.
Penny, back in the house, please.

55:47.791 --> 55:50.997
He said a painter lived here.
Radcliffe was a painter.

55:51.037 --> 55:54.965
All that information is
on the internet for anyone to see.

55:55.005 --> 55:57.851
These guys always do their research.

55:57.891 --> 56:01.017
Go and hang with your brother.
I'll be up in a minute.

56:01.058 --> 56:03.502
Wait. Where are you going?

56:03.543 --> 56:07.671
I'm just going to check on Dad.
. I'll come with you. No.

56:07.711 --> 56:11.398
Penny, your dad and I need
a bit of private time, OK?

56:11.438 --> 56:14.605
Take this -
in case of anything untoward!

56:16.208 --> 56:17.691
OK.

56:24.144 --> 56:27.190
Metempsychosis.

56:32.681 --> 56:34.926
"Metempsychotic pharmacy."

56:38.854 --> 56:40.337
Jesus!

57:06.950 --> 57:08.874
Charles Kendrick Walker.

57:11.399 --> 57:14.566
I've always wondered
about this place.

57:34.085 --> 57:35.648
Alec?

57:40.298 --> 57:41.700
Alec?

58:12.322 --> 58:14.326
What do you think?

58:15.008 --> 58:17.372
What is this?

58:18.294 --> 58:21.020
Jesus!
Different, huh?

58:21.060 --> 58:24.747
I wanted to wait till
she was a little bit further along,

58:24.787 --> 58:27.593
but I suppose now's as good a time
as any.

58:30.118 --> 58:33.244
I could have done with a couple
more sessions with you.

58:33.284 --> 58:36.651
I had to settle for sketching you
while you slept. Me?

58:37.653 --> 58:42.944
Alec, this isn't me. Wait till
she's cast and finished. You'll see.

58:44.387 --> 58:47.072
You're difficult to nail down.
Jesus!

58:47.112 --> 58:49.677
What have you done to yourself?

58:51.722 --> 58:55.529
It sounds crazy, but the blood
makes the clay easier to work.

58:55.569 --> 58:58.215
The woman in Radcliffe's portrait.

59:00.098 --> 59:05.469
His wife. Why are you sculpting
Radcliffe's wife?

59:05.509 --> 59:07.554
What are you talking about?

59:08.836 --> 59:12.564
It's exactly the same face,
the same position, everything.

59:12.604 --> 59:14.808
Meg, it's supposed to be you.

59:17.534 --> 59:20.099
Alec, he was a Rosicrucian.

59:20.139 --> 59:24.067
He killed his wife in some ritual
in this house.

59:24.107 --> 59:27.594
This job's pushed you over the edge.
You need to get back to therapy.

59:27.634 --> 59:32.123
Our daughter is having a breakdown.
She believes she saw this woman
in her bedroom.

59:32.163 --> 59:35.209
That was a nightmare.
You said so yourself.

59:35.249 --> 59:37.293
I'm going back to London.

59:37.334 --> 59:40.099
No. I'm taking the kids.
I'll run the job from there.

59:40.139 --> 59:43.466
NO! I'm not going anywhere
and neither are you.

59:45.149 --> 59:47.354
Don't you care about our daughter?

59:47.394 --> 59:50.841
Of course I do, but I also care
about me for a change.

59:53.206 --> 59:57.053
This is the best work
I've ever done. Probably ever!

59:58.015 --> 01:00:02.464
I'm not about to give that up now.
This isn't your work, Alec.

01:00:02.504 --> 01:00:06.873
What are you talking about?
You don't draw like this.

01:00:06.913 --> 01:00:10.120
This is your stuff and I love it!
It's real.

01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:12.284
This is not yours.

01:00:24.549 --> 01:00:26.312
Get out!

01:00:41.463 --> 01:00:43.186
Um...

01:00:43.226 --> 01:00:48.357
First thing tomorrow,
after we've had a good sleep,
I'm going to have a family meeting.

01:00:48.397 --> 01:00:50.481
I think I'm ready to...

01:00:50.521 --> 01:00:53.327
go back to London
and work the build from there.

01:00:53.367 --> 01:00:54.970
Really?

01:00:56.854 --> 01:01:02.465
It's going to cost a lot more money,
but I think I can persuade Bradley
to step up.

01:01:02.505 --> 01:01:05.351
Mum...we should leave now.

01:01:06.754 --> 01:01:09.199
Your father's not ready
to leave yet.

01:01:09.239 --> 01:01:11.203
And, um...

01:01:11.243 --> 01:01:14.049
and I'm not leaving him here
on his own.

01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:51.565
Harper?
Mum!

01:02:53.088 --> 01:02:55.012
Harper?
Mum!

01:02:55.693 --> 01:02:57.417
Harper?

01:02:59.701 --> 01:03:02.667
Are you there?
Mum! Mum!

01:03:02.708 --> 01:03:04.591
Harper?

01:03:05.994 --> 01:03:08.800
Mum! Stop! Stop!
Harper, where are you?

01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:12.407
Mum! Mum! Mum!
I hear you. I can't...

01:03:12.447 --> 01:03:15.052
Mum? Mum!

01:03:21.305 --> 01:03:25.193
Harper!
Mum! Mum! Get the door!

01:03:41.666 --> 01:03:46.235
Harper, is that you? Are you there?
Answer me!

01:03:52.969 --> 01:03:54.692
Shit!

01:03:55.494 --> 01:03:57.939
For Christ's sake, Penny!
Where's Harper?

01:03:57.979 --> 01:04:01.586
I think he's fallen into
the root cellar. The what?

01:04:01.626 --> 01:04:03.831
OK, I'll find Dad.
No!

01:04:10.043 --> 01:04:12.889
Harper, get back from the wall.

01:04:12.929 --> 01:04:15.294
Get back from the wall!

01:04:20.785 --> 01:04:22.228
Dad?

01:04:25.555 --> 01:04:27.038
Dad?

01:04:31.406 --> 01:04:32.849
Dad?

01:04:35.655 --> 01:04:38.421
Dad? Dad?

01:04:39.583 --> 01:04:41.066
Dad...?

01:04:47.439 --> 01:04:49.042
Mum.

01:04:49.082 --> 01:04:50.805
Mum! Mum!

01:04:51.607 --> 01:04:54.012
Mum! Mum.

01:04:55.335 --> 01:04:56.978
Mum!

01:04:57.018 --> 01:04:59.142
Mum!

01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:05.075
God!

01:06:11.809 --> 01:06:14.214
God! Oh, God!

01:06:32.210 --> 01:06:34.815
God! Oh, God!

01:07:21.910 --> 01:07:23.954
Where did you go?

01:07:41.309 --> 01:07:42.953
Come on.

01:07:52.211 --> 01:07:55.097
Did you see Dad?
No. I was down there when I woke up.

01:07:55.137 --> 01:07:59.185
How do you think you got there?
It wasn't Dad. It was the ghost.

01:08:00.388 --> 01:08:05.678
Shit. My keys are upstairs
in my bag. Please don't leave us.

01:08:05.718 --> 01:08:08.003
Well, come with me, then.
No!

01:08:08.043 --> 01:08:13.093
We can't sit here all night. You
need your inhaler. I'm going back.
Lock the door!

01:08:26.921 --> 01:08:28.645
God!

01:08:28.685 --> 01:08:30.127
What?

01:08:31.930 --> 01:08:33.694
Penny?

01:08:33.734 --> 01:08:35.899
Penny? Ssh.

01:08:35.939 --> 01:08:39.506
It's OK. Ssh.
We're safe in here, OK?

01:08:42.432 --> 01:08:44.395
We're going to die.

01:08:48.805 --> 01:08:51.611
Ssh. It's OK. It's OK.

01:08:59.305 --> 01:09:01.350
How are you feeling?

01:09:01.390 --> 01:09:07.162
Where have you been, Alec?
I went for a walk on the moor.

01:09:07.202 --> 01:09:09.487
To clear my head.

01:09:09.527 --> 01:09:11.691
Are you sure you're feeling OK?

01:09:14.417 --> 01:09:16.581
You're wearing a coat.

01:09:17.502 --> 01:09:19.426
Are you leaving?

01:09:19.466 --> 01:09:24.437
I thought I'd take the kids
to Grandpa's for a couple of days.
I'll come right back.

01:09:27.243 --> 01:09:30.970
But we're getting so close.
I just think we all need a break.

01:09:32.934 --> 01:09:35.660
Why don't we just talk about this...

01:09:37.022 --> 01:09:39.026
..when I get back?

01:09:43.115 --> 01:09:46.801
You can't abandon me.
There's so much to be done.

01:10:06.081 --> 01:10:08.566
Why are you behaving like this?

01:10:17.344 --> 01:10:18.987
Harper?

01:10:20.189 --> 01:10:22.674
Penny? Where the fuck's the car?

01:10:25.681 --> 01:10:27.484
Penny!

01:10:28.847 --> 01:10:30.410
Harper?

01:10:30.450 --> 01:10:32.815
Where's the fucking car?

01:10:32.855 --> 01:10:35.540
Help me, somebody. Please.

01:10:35.581 --> 01:10:37.344
Penny? Harper?

01:10:38.827 --> 01:10:42.555
We need to talk. The kids have gone.
Someone's taken the car.

01:10:42.595 --> 01:10:44.679
What kids?

01:10:44.719 --> 01:10:47.364
Let go of me. Let go of me!

01:11:13.096 --> 01:11:15.341
Isabella.

01:11:15.381 --> 01:11:17.505
What are you doing in here?

01:11:17.545 --> 01:11:20.030
It's nearly time.
We have to get ready.

01:11:22.555 --> 01:11:24.479
What's happening to us, Alec?

01:11:25.842 --> 01:11:29.690
Who's Alec? One of your lovers?
Stop it.

01:11:29.730 --> 01:11:31.213
Stop it!

01:11:32.335 --> 01:11:35.421
Keep away from me.
You're losing your fucking mind!

01:11:35.461 --> 01:11:37.425
We made a secret pact.

01:11:37.465 --> 01:11:39.990
You can't lose heart, Isabella.

01:11:41.073 --> 01:11:43.798
Alec, I think Radcliffe's trying
to possess you.

01:11:43.838 --> 01:11:46.684
You've got to fight him...

01:11:57.546 --> 01:12:00.472
I love you more than life itself,
Bella.

01:12:19.470 --> 01:12:22.075
Are you OK?

01:12:22.115 --> 01:12:24.721
I think I peed.

01:12:24.761 --> 01:12:27.446
When I say run, you run with me, OK?

01:12:29.891 --> 01:12:34.460
OK? OK. One, two, three...

01:12:35.222 --> 01:12:36.705
Run!

01:12:47.166 --> 01:12:48.929
What now?

01:13:16.264 --> 01:13:19.792
Why is there never any signal
in this stupid place?

01:13:19.832 --> 01:13:22.156
OK, I think it's this way.

01:13:22.196 --> 01:13:25.804
What if the ghost has killed Mum?
Stop thinking those thoughts.

01:13:25.844 --> 01:13:28.569
YOU think those thoughts.
Well, I'm older than you.

01:13:28.609 --> 01:13:33.579
What will we do if he has?
We'll get home and find Dad.

01:13:33.619 --> 01:13:38.429
He'll know what to do.
What if the ghost has killed Dad?
We'll run away back to London.

01:13:39.551 --> 01:13:40.834
OK.

01:13:41.796 --> 01:13:45.283
We have to run, Harper.
Stay close to me, OK?

01:14:02.317 --> 01:14:04.081
My gosh.

01:14:16.867 --> 01:14:19.111
You! You there!

01:14:20.314 --> 01:14:21.676
Harper!

01:14:26.606 --> 01:14:28.169
Harper?

01:14:29.051 --> 01:14:30.654
Harper!

01:14:31.737 --> 01:14:32.939
Penny?

01:14:34.823 --> 01:14:36.346
Harper?

01:16:19.995 --> 01:16:21.678
Daddy! Daddy!

01:16:27.410 --> 01:16:28.692
Dad?

01:16:28.732 --> 01:16:30.456
Stop it, Dad.

01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:34.865
Dad! ! Ow!

01:16:34.905 --> 01:16:37.430
Dad! Let go! Dad!

01:16:46.208 --> 01:16:48.332
No!

01:16:48.372 --> 01:16:50.777
Dad! Let me out!

01:16:50.817 --> 01:16:52.741
Dad! Dad!

01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:13.585
Harper!

01:19:13.625 --> 01:19:15.869
We need to get you out of there.

01:19:21.401 --> 01:19:23.765
Harper, stand back from the window.

01:19:37.713 --> 01:19:40.279
Are you OK? Yeah.

01:19:40.319 --> 01:19:43.966
Dad's gone mad.
We've got to find Mum.

01:19:44.006 --> 01:19:46.852
Have you seen her?
No.

01:19:46.892 --> 01:19:48.976
Penny, he's changed.

01:19:50.259 --> 01:19:54.227
He locked me in the room.
The ghost got inside him.

01:19:54.267 --> 01:19:56.632
OK. Let's go.

01:22:13.628 --> 01:22:15.191
Boy!

01:22:36.714 --> 01:22:37.997
Mum.

01:22:40.201 --> 01:22:42.165
Mum, wake up.

01:22:49.380 --> 01:22:51.785
Wake up. Wake up.
My head.

01:23:00.923 --> 01:23:03.689
Mum, come with me. We have to hurry.

01:23:27.176 --> 01:23:29.380
God, what's happening?

01:23:35.232 --> 01:23:37.116
The window.

01:23:37.156 --> 01:23:40.242
We can reach the fire escape
from the rooftop.

01:24:01.726 --> 01:24:04.010
Isabella. Please.

01:24:10.303 --> 01:24:13.750
Don't look down.
Don't look down, please.

01:24:13.790 --> 01:24:15.674
Please!

01:24:15.714 --> 01:24:17.558
Charles!

01:24:47.538 --> 01:24:49.542
Why did you do that?

01:24:51.907 --> 01:24:54.793
Are you all right?
My head.

01:24:54.833 --> 01:24:57.558
My back.

01:24:57.598 --> 01:24:59.883
What happened?
Alec.

01:25:02.208 --> 01:25:04.292
You scared us.

01:26:57.520 --> 01:26:59.404
I love you, petal.
