WEBVTT

00:14.264 --> 00:16.349
You know, someday,
weeks will go by,

00:16.433 --> 00:20.270
maybe even years, it won't
even cross our minds.

00:20.353 --> 00:23.023
We'll come home,
and we'll talk about work.

00:24.691 --> 00:26.526
And what we want
for dinner...

00:26.609 --> 00:27.819
movies.

00:27.902 --> 00:29.195
Nursery schools.

00:33.283 --> 00:35.160
It's going to be great.

00:38.288 --> 00:41.499
Yeah. Yeah, all
we got to do is survive.

00:42.459 --> 00:43.585
We will.

00:44.461 --> 00:45.712
I promise.

00:48.757 --> 00:49.799
What happened?

00:49.883 --> 00:52.385
Nothing. The detonator
must have failed.

00:52.469 --> 00:54.471
Distract them.
We'll be there in five minutes.

00:54.554 --> 00:56.139
No, we don't have
five seconds, Michael.

00:56.222 --> 00:58.308
Then you'll have
to trigger it manually.

00:59.601 --> 01:01.394
How much time
is that gonna give me?

01:03.813 --> 01:06.441
Out. Now.

01:09.194 --> 01:11.321
Alex?

01:11.654 --> 01:12.655
Alex?

01:13.948 --> 01:15.366
It's wiped clean.

01:15.450 --> 01:17.577
That's not possible.
Really?

01:17.660 --> 01:19.287
Well, then where is it?
Where's the data?

01:19.370 --> 01:21.247
It was intact
when I took it.

01:22.248 --> 01:24.584
I'll tell you what,
If it doesn't boot up

01:24.667 --> 01:25.960
in ten seconds,
I'm gonna

01:26.044 --> 01:28.338
splatter your skull
all over these walls.

01:28.421 --> 01:29.714
I came to you.
I want this over.

01:29.798 --> 01:31.299
Why would I jeopardize that?

01:33.635 --> 01:36.805
I don't believe that Michael
just let you have it.

01:36.888 --> 01:39.349
He didn't. He left me alone
in a room, and I took it.

01:40.517 --> 01:43.436
And that wasn't the least bit
suspicious to you?

01:44.354 --> 01:45.730
Maybe. I...

01:47.565 --> 01:48.608
I don't know.

01:49.818 --> 01:51.152
Or you're lying.

01:55.406 --> 01:56.783
Kill the junkie.

02:17.971 --> 02:21.516
Oh! You pathetic slug.

02:21.599 --> 02:23.893
Sara was the only
leverage we had.

02:23.977 --> 02:26.187
Scofield's donned
many a chapeau,

02:26.271 --> 02:27.605
but human fly?

02:27.689 --> 02:30.567
I should anticipate him
scaling the building?

02:31.317 --> 02:32.902
Move on Panama.

02:33.778 --> 02:34.821
Proffer your nine.

02:41.536 --> 02:44.539
Men in my employ,
Bagwell...

02:44.956 --> 02:46.332
anticipate.

02:47.417 --> 02:48.793
They cover their bases.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.713
They refuse to fail,

02:51.796 --> 02:55.133
which you seem to do
with unyielding consistency.

02:59.304 --> 03:00.680
That's got to be Sara's phone.

03:01.181 --> 03:02.557
I should answer it.

03:04.100 --> 03:05.310
What do you got
to lose, General?

03:08.521 --> 03:09.898
Yello?

03:09.981 --> 03:11.774
Who the hell is this?

03:11.858 --> 03:13.109
Is this Fernando Sucre?

03:13.193 --> 03:14.485
Oh, thank you, God.

03:14.569 --> 03:15.528
Bagwell?

03:15.612 --> 03:16.905
Yeah.

03:16.988 --> 03:17.989
And we're on the same team,

03:18.072 --> 03:19.240
brother, same team.

03:19.324 --> 03:21.242
Our boys are
in a hell of a pickle.

03:21.326 --> 03:22.535
Where's Michael?

03:22.619 --> 03:25.246
Uh, his mother snatched
him and Tancredi.

03:25.330 --> 03:27.040
Linc, too! and I personally

03:27.123 --> 03:28.917
took a nasty beat-down.

03:29.000 --> 03:30.585
Where does she have them?

03:30.668 --> 03:31.753
I got an idea,

03:31.836 --> 03:32.879
but I can't say on the phone.

03:32.962 --> 03:33.922
I'm running scared, amigo.

03:34.005 --> 03:35.256
Okay, cool it. You know what?

03:35.340 --> 03:37.467
Um, we got somebody
who can help us out,

03:37.550 --> 03:39.385
but I need to get ahold
of Michael.

03:39.469 --> 03:42.138
We should, uh, we should get
together and pool our resources.

03:42.222 --> 03:45.099
The park on 72nd Avenue,
uh, in an hour?

03:47.352 --> 03:48.853
Okay, I'll be there.

03:48.937 --> 03:50.730
Excellent, perfecto.

03:52.357 --> 03:55.151
He's got someone
who can help on his cause,

03:55.235 --> 03:57.362
I'm certain can
draw out Scofield.

03:57.445 --> 03:59.530
You're certain of nothing.

03:59.614 --> 04:00.531
Yet I do have

04:00.615 --> 04:02.992
a sit-down with Scofield's
friend in an hour.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.702
You got no
better hand, General.

04:12.877 --> 04:14.796
Your breathing is short.
Does it hurt to inhale?

04:14.879 --> 04:17.131
I'm fine.
Hell, you've collapsed your lung.

04:17.215 --> 04:19.509
No hospital.
Hospital means jail.

04:19.592 --> 04:21.552
Come on! come on!

04:21.636 --> 04:23.137
Can you treat him?
I don't know.

04:23.221 --> 04:24.681
I need a better look
before I can try.

04:25.139 --> 04:26.140
Christina?

04:27.558 --> 04:28.643
Buried.

04:52.292 --> 04:55.044
You are a sight
for sore eyes, my friend.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.629
Can the reunion.

04:56.713 --> 04:58.298
Where can I find
Michael and Lincoln?

04:58.381 --> 05:00.174
Admittedly, they're
in dire straits.

05:00.258 --> 05:01.676
Are you deaf?

05:01.759 --> 05:05.388
Unlikely, amigo. I just heard the dime
drop on your sorry ass.

05:05.471 --> 05:07.932
And from the bench
over my left shoulder,

05:08.016 --> 05:10.560
the gentlemen
in the Wayfarers?

05:10.643 --> 05:13.187
Just like in Fox River,
you never thought things through.

05:13.271 --> 05:15.189
Now, are you gonna
name the friend

05:15.273 --> 05:16.691
who said he'd show up
and help out the brothers?

05:16.774 --> 05:20.903
No. You're gonna hand Sara's phone,
or I'll break your face.

05:20.987 --> 05:24.365
Accuse me of being deaf, but you're
the one that's going blind, Puerto Rican.

05:24.449 --> 05:27.368
The man's a Company operative
trained assassin.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.875
What's up, Jethro?

05:35.918 --> 05:38.796
We're a long way from Fox
River, T-Bag. Let's go.

05:43.134 --> 05:44.927
Yeah, I got Tancredi's phone.

05:47.597 --> 05:50.224
Paging Dr. Bender.

05:50.308 --> 05:51.642
Do you know if he's diabetic?

05:51.726 --> 05:52.894
On some medication
he may have missed?

05:52.977 --> 05:55.063
I have no idea.
Any chance he's faking it?

05:55.146 --> 05:56.481
No. His pupils are dilated.

05:56.564 --> 05:59.525
He needs a head CT stat,
EKG and a chest X-ray.

05:59.609 --> 06:01.694
He may have bled into his
brain or had a heart attack.

06:02.820 --> 06:04.405
Franco.

06:04.489 --> 06:05.406
It wasn't just Scofield

06:05.490 --> 06:06.824
and Burrows.
This is the team

06:06.908 --> 06:08.409
that Self had
at the warehouse.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.121
Former federal agent.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.706
Yeah, Self was into
something nasty.

06:14.832 --> 06:16.584
Agent Self, can you hear me?

06:16.667 --> 06:17.919
Agent Franco, we have to move him.

06:18.002 --> 06:19.253
Where are Scofield
and Burrows?

06:19.337 --> 06:20.463
We're going now.

06:23.007 --> 06:26.094
His finger moved.
He can hear me.

06:26.177 --> 06:27.804
Agent Self,
can you help us?

06:29.305 --> 06:30.681
He's not going anywhere.

06:34.977 --> 06:36.396
Michael,
what's the plan?

06:37.105 --> 06:38.356
Who do we trust?

06:38.898 --> 06:39.941
No one.

06:40.024 --> 06:41.943
We're out of options.

06:42.026 --> 06:43.778
Then maybe we destroy it.

06:44.737 --> 06:45.780
Destroy Scylla.

06:49.909 --> 06:51.661
Is that it?

06:51.744 --> 06:52.954
Is that where we're at?

06:54.705 --> 06:57.083
What if the General
decides to retaliate?

06:57.166 --> 06:59.252
He will even if we
give it to him.

07:00.044 --> 07:01.921
We can crush it,
incinerate it,

07:02.797 --> 07:03.923
throw it in the ocean.

07:04.006 --> 07:05.383
All three sound good.

07:05.883 --> 07:06.717
Alex?

07:11.639 --> 07:12.682
All right.

07:13.891 --> 07:15.393
Then it's decided.

07:22.650 --> 07:23.818
Hello.

07:24.610 --> 07:26.237
Hello, Michael.

07:31.075 --> 07:33.870
You're a tough man
to get ahold of.

07:33.953 --> 07:35.538
Kellerman!

08:10.948 --> 08:12.116
I heard you were dead.

08:12.658 --> 08:15.703
Those rumors
were greatly exaggerated.

08:16.537 --> 08:19.707
No, I was, um... freed

08:19.790 --> 08:21.834
by a group working
against the Company.

08:21.918 --> 08:23.211
The same group
founded by your father.

08:23.294 --> 08:24.295
I'm working with them.

08:24.378 --> 08:26.380
Could've used
a hand, Paul.

08:26.464 --> 08:27.757
Do you have Scylla?

08:27.840 --> 08:29.217
What do you think?

08:29.300 --> 08:30.301
I think you do.

08:31.260 --> 08:32.386
Michael, there is a

08:32.470 --> 08:34.722
UN attachÃ©, who
will be in Miami today at five O'clock

08:34.805 --> 08:36.057
to receive Scylla from you.

08:36.140 --> 08:38.601
Why should I trust a word
coming out of your mouth?

08:38.684 --> 08:40.978
I assume you know that
what you have can...

08:41.938 --> 08:44.357
and this is no exaggeration...
change the world

08:44.440 --> 08:45.900
for the better.

08:47.068 --> 08:49.862
All you have to do
is deliver it.

08:49.946 --> 08:51.197
And you don't
need to trust me.

08:51.280 --> 08:54.116
Just trust the people that work
at the United Nations.

08:58.621 --> 08:59.997
The phone died.

09:00.081 --> 09:02.083
He's not getting any better.

09:02.166 --> 09:04.085
All right, come on.
Let's get him up.

09:04.168 --> 09:05.962
I got to get some supplies.

09:14.303 --> 09:15.721
Yeah.

09:15.805 --> 09:16.973
Okay.

09:20.643 --> 09:21.769
That was Kellerman.

09:21.852 --> 09:25.439
This Alabama trailer trash
has been making good.

09:25.523 --> 09:27.233
He hooked up with
General Krantz.

09:27.316 --> 09:28.609
What's it to you, rug-head?

09:28.693 --> 09:30.486
Well, where is
the General now?

09:30.570 --> 09:32.154
Same place as your daddy.

09:32.238 --> 09:34.156
Location unknown.

09:44.208 --> 09:46.544
Do you remember that day

09:46.627 --> 09:49.589
we were in the chow line,
Fox River,

09:49.672 --> 09:52.508
you made that offhanded comment
to me?

09:52.592 --> 09:55.261
I believe it had
a racial bent to it.

09:55.344 --> 09:56.387
Yeah.

09:56.470 --> 09:58.306
Do you remember
your broken jaw?

09:59.807 --> 10:01.934
Now, just imagine what I can do
to you right now

10:02.018 --> 10:03.894
with something
real on the line.

10:03.978 --> 10:05.229
Such as?

10:05.313 --> 10:07.064
We need the General's location.

10:07.148 --> 10:08.441
What's in it for me?

10:09.650 --> 10:11.694
If we take Scylla to the place
it's supposed to be,

10:12.737 --> 10:14.030
there'll be an immunity list.

10:14.113 --> 10:15.239
You could be on it.

10:15.323 --> 10:16.282
No.

10:16.365 --> 10:19.035
Where I'm sitting, albeit
momentarily compromised,

10:19.118 --> 10:20.661
you're backing the wrong horse.

10:20.745 --> 10:22.246
Scofield cannot pull this out.

10:22.330 --> 10:25.458
You help me get him to the
General and we are set for life!

10:25.541 --> 10:27.084
Man, I don't have
time for this, man.

10:27.168 --> 10:29.879
Time? It's time you backed a winner
for once, my chocolate friend!

10:29.962 --> 10:31.714
Ow!

10:32.506 --> 10:34.300
Sit down!

10:34.383 --> 10:35.843
Now where is
the General?

10:40.598 --> 10:43.392
Where... is... the General?

10:46.729 --> 10:48.981
No word from Agent Frost
or Bagwell.

10:49.065 --> 10:50.650
That slippery little rat.

10:50.733 --> 10:52.818
If he's AWOL, I'll
skin him alive.

10:52.902 --> 10:54.278
No way he got
over on Frost.

10:54.362 --> 10:55.613
He's... he's captured...

10:56.155 --> 10:57.198
or dead.

10:57.531 --> 10:58.991
So we're exposed here.

11:00.534 --> 11:01.494
Is this the end?

11:03.079 --> 11:04.330
Whimpering?

11:04.413 --> 11:08.042
There's no shame
in retreating to regroup, sir.

11:08.125 --> 11:11.337
That, son, is a
tremendous load.

11:14.965 --> 11:16.008
Yeah?

11:20.096 --> 11:22.598
Lincoln Burrows' phone
pinged a cell tower downtown.

11:22.682 --> 11:23.724
We have his location.

11:23.808 --> 11:25.810
Then what are you doing here?

11:33.526 --> 11:34.902
You holding up?

11:37.738 --> 11:39.824
You're going to give
Scylla to Kellerman?

11:42.493 --> 11:43.619
I don't know.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.162
Do you trust him?

11:47.248 --> 11:48.165
No.

11:49.333 --> 11:50.835
The thought of walking free
from this

11:50.918 --> 11:52.378
sounds pretty good right now.

11:52.461 --> 11:54.422
I mean, that-that was the goal.

11:54.505 --> 11:56.257
Five O'clock,
Declan Plaza.

11:56.340 --> 11:58.050
It's right across town.

11:58.134 --> 11:59.969
If you have to leave,
Michael, you should.

12:00.052 --> 12:01.637
I'm not leaving
you, Linc.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.139
You're my brother.

12:06.350 --> 12:07.893
Not according to Christina.

12:07.977 --> 12:10.521
Don't let her mess
with your head.

12:10.604 --> 12:12.898
Well, maybe it's true.

12:14.024 --> 12:16.110
I keep... I keep
playing things

12:16.193 --> 12:18.320
over in my head
from-from our childhood...

12:18.404 --> 12:19.780
Doesn't matter
what she said.

12:19.864 --> 12:22.366
It doesn't change anything.

12:25.536 --> 12:28.330
You're stuck with me
whether you like it or not.

12:32.126 --> 12:34.128
The doc said the CT scanner is free.

12:34.211 --> 12:35.880
We got to take him now.
No, he stays till he talks.

12:35.963 --> 12:37.173
He's worse than he was
ten minutes ago.

12:37.256 --> 12:38.758
He won't be talking
anytime soon.

12:38.841 --> 12:40.509
Yeah, but you can write,
can't you, Don?

12:40.593 --> 12:42.470
So you give me
what I need,

12:42.553 --> 12:44.680
and you'll get top-notch
care and a pension.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.891
Or you can waste away
in front of us

12:46.974 --> 12:50.352
until you have the brain
capacity of a peanut.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.189
Your choice.

12:59.487 --> 13:00.821
All right, all right,
all right, all right,

13:00.905 --> 13:02.114
all right, come on.

13:46.700 --> 13:48.577
Excuse me, um...

13:48.661 --> 13:50.329
May I speak to you
for a second?

14:18.274 --> 14:20.609
Alex was arrested.
Federal agents.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.027
We need to get him.

14:23.404 --> 14:26.699
If we give Scylla to Kellerman,
Alex gets exonerated.

14:26.782 --> 14:27.992
He's fine.

14:29.743 --> 14:31.120
We need to get the fluid out.

14:31.203 --> 14:33.205
It should ease the pressure
and help him breathe.

14:37.626 --> 14:39.670
Can you hold that?

14:42.464 --> 14:44.758
That won't last long,
but we can go.

14:50.639 --> 14:52.057
Mind if I drive?

15:04.987 --> 15:07.823
In two minutes, your eyeballs

15:07.907 --> 15:10.117
are gonna pop
out of your head.

15:11.869 --> 15:13.245
Now, that's
worse than death.

15:15.414 --> 15:17.374
I can't betray.

15:19.001 --> 15:21.921
My destiny is to be...

15:22.546 --> 15:25.174
a respected gentleman.

15:25.257 --> 15:27.927
Where's the General,
you son of a bitch?

15:39.855 --> 15:41.982
Battered and bruised.

15:42.650 --> 15:44.276
Staring death in the face.

15:45.611 --> 15:47.237
Surprising that
you still need

15:47.321 --> 15:49.865
more assurance
that you've come to the end of the line.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.283
We don't have Scylla.

15:52.409 --> 15:53.619
Michael...

15:54.203 --> 15:55.537
your brother is dying.

15:58.499 --> 16:00.125
It's fascinating...

16:01.126 --> 16:05.547
watching the blood
drain from his face.

16:06.423 --> 16:07.508
Do you suppose

16:07.591 --> 16:10.552
that he would like to see
that happen to his girlfriend?

16:20.646 --> 16:22.314
Sofia...

16:24.149 --> 16:26.860
You give me Scylla or he can
sit there and watch

16:26.944 --> 16:30.280
as Sofia's throat is slit.

16:34.535 --> 16:36.370
The gun that killed Naveen Banerjee.

16:36.453 --> 16:39.081
We pulled Lincoln Burrows'
thumbprint off the stock.

16:39.164 --> 16:40.666
We got video of you
outside the crime scene

16:40.749 --> 16:42.084
with Burrows.

16:42.167 --> 16:43.669
Isn't that a coincidence?

16:45.754 --> 16:47.506
Lincoln didn't kill Banerjee.

16:49.508 --> 16:50.759
He was set up.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.094
By whom?

17:01.395 --> 17:02.771
It was the Company.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.065
The Company. You know
what I'm talking about?

17:05.149 --> 17:07.443
They've developed a device
that's called Scylla.

17:07.526 --> 17:09.069
If you want to see
the light of day again

17:09.153 --> 17:10.446
as a free man,
you'll give us

17:10.529 --> 17:12.114
Scofield and Burrows...
You're missing what's

17:12.197 --> 17:13.657
right in front of your face!

17:15.367 --> 17:17.202
The brothers
didn't kill anybody.

17:20.372 --> 17:21.373
You say you're here

17:21.457 --> 17:23.000
'cause you want
to do the right thing?

17:23.542 --> 17:24.835
Then listen to me.

17:24.918 --> 17:26.462
Listen to what
I'm telling you.

17:28.922 --> 17:30.549
Scofield and Burrows.

17:31.967 --> 17:33.469
Where are they?

17:35.387 --> 17:37.598
Sofia...

17:38.974 --> 17:41.935
Granted, it is a
dreadful decision,

17:42.019 --> 17:44.188
but you pondered
it long enough.

17:44.563 --> 17:45.397
You have me.

17:45.481 --> 17:47.649
I don't really care
about you, Lincoln.

17:47.733 --> 17:49.443
I just want my property.

17:49.526 --> 17:50.903
All right.

17:50.986 --> 17:52.321
Let's say I do
know where it is.

17:52.404 --> 17:53.405
Why should I tell you?

17:53.489 --> 17:55.074
You're just gonna
kill us anyway.

17:55.157 --> 17:58.160
True, you and your brother
are walking dead,

17:58.243 --> 18:01.413
but if I get Scylla
within the next half hour,

18:02.081 --> 18:03.665
I'll release Sofia.

18:03.749 --> 18:05.042
And what about Sara?

18:07.753 --> 18:10.672
We're negotiating
for Sofia right now.

18:10.756 --> 18:11.924
I want you to let her go.

18:12.007 --> 18:13.634
And I want
a decision, Michael.

18:13.717 --> 18:15.385
Let her go!

18:22.434 --> 18:23.852
All right.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.104
Don't move.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.690
Let Sofia go.

18:28.774 --> 18:30.442
Now.
Make the call.

18:39.785 --> 18:41.286
Stand down.

18:42.412 --> 18:43.956
Just let her walk.

18:44.790 --> 18:46.375
Yes, immediately!

19:00.806 --> 19:02.099
All right.

19:03.809 --> 19:05.060
And this is where
we say good-bye.

19:05.144 --> 19:06.395
Michael, no!

19:06.478 --> 19:07.771
Kill him.

19:07.855 --> 19:09.857
No. We leave.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.568
Listen to her, Michael.

19:12.651 --> 19:14.027
Kill him.

19:14.111 --> 19:15.571
I'm just an old man

19:16.530 --> 19:17.990
who's lost everything.

19:19.324 --> 19:20.868
You win, Michael.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.370
And you, Lincoln.

19:23.453 --> 19:25.497
You win, Michael!

19:25.581 --> 19:27.457
You both win.

19:29.251 --> 19:32.921
Because it's all
just a game, isn't it?

19:33.005 --> 19:36.758
When you get to be
as old as I am, Michael,

19:36.842 --> 19:39.386
should you survive so long,

19:39.469 --> 19:43.348
you, too, will see that's
exactly what it all is-

19:43.432 --> 19:45.058
a game.

19:45.142 --> 19:46.185
Kill him.

19:46.268 --> 19:50.564
Listen to me, huh, just listen to me.

19:52.232 --> 19:56.028
I didn't risk everything
to come down here for revenge.

19:59.656 --> 20:01.366
I'm here to clear my name.

20:06.496 --> 20:07.956
Do you have Scylla?

20:09.791 --> 20:11.001
Yes.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.213
Then let's go.

20:20.302 --> 20:22.638
Come on, General.

20:27.059 --> 20:29.561
Never thought I'd be so happy to see you.

20:30.312 --> 20:31.730
Tell me something.
Yeah?

20:31.813 --> 20:35.108
Are you sure we can
trust Kellerman?

20:35.192 --> 20:36.902
You know, the only
thing I'm sure of

20:36.985 --> 20:38.695
is that he's our last option.

20:39.488 --> 20:41.073
Gentlemen, we gotta leave.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.713
Wait for me!

21:08.684 --> 21:09.768
Michael?

21:12.145 --> 21:13.021
Freeze! I'll shoot!

21:14.898 --> 21:16.441
Go! Go!

21:17.067 --> 21:18.777
Michael, go.

21:41.883 --> 21:44.636
He's not going to
make it much longer without a hospital.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.972
No.
Not till this is done.

21:47.055 --> 21:51.268
Hey, Linc,
I need your phone.

21:53.186 --> 21:54.896
Here.

21:54.980 --> 21:56.523
Dial Kellerman's number.

21:57.482 --> 21:58.984
Don't tell me
you're getting cold feet.

21:59.067 --> 22:00.610
Just dial it, please.

22:04.823 --> 22:06.700
It's voice mail.

22:12.789 --> 22:15.000
You'd better come through
for us in the end.

22:17.294 --> 22:18.670
Yeah, he will.

22:19.338 --> 22:20.672
Yeah, well...

22:22.591 --> 22:24.718
We know him a little bit
better than you do.

22:24.801 --> 22:26.720
Be sure to turn
the phone off.

22:26.803 --> 22:29.556
That's how Krantz
found us before.

22:30.474 --> 22:31.850
And somebody already has.

22:31.933 --> 22:33.477
Yo, hey, hey,
get out, get out!

22:33.560 --> 22:34.811
Get out! Get out!

22:42.194 --> 22:43.278
Ahh!

22:53.955 --> 22:55.248
Just make the call.

22:55.332 --> 22:56.833
Get Scofield or Burrows

22:56.917 --> 22:58.627
or whoever they're
in business with.

22:58.710 --> 22:59.753
Get them on the phone.

22:59.836 --> 23:00.879
This is your last chance

23:00.962 --> 23:02.672
before we take the deal
to Mahone.

23:04.049 --> 23:06.426
If Mahone was talking,
you guys wouldn't be here.

23:06.510 --> 23:07.844
What kind of man are you?

23:07.928 --> 23:09.638
I mean, you got your woman
and your baby up north.

23:09.721 --> 23:10.806
Don't you want
to look out for them?

23:10.889 --> 23:12.015
Don't you want
to get their back?

23:12.099 --> 23:13.266
Why the hell you gonna
give all that up

23:13.350 --> 23:14.559
for two guys
you did time with?

23:14.643 --> 23:16.728
Unless something went down
at Fox River that we don't know about.

23:16.812 --> 23:18.105
Are you guys blind?

23:18.188 --> 23:19.856
Don't you see, they're trying
to do something

23:19.940 --> 23:21.066
that's bigger than all this.

23:21.149 --> 23:23.360
Then you're dumber
than you look.

23:23.443 --> 23:25.529
Are you going to make
the call or not?

23:25.612 --> 23:26.988
Last chance.

23:29.366 --> 23:30.826
No.

24:12.325 --> 24:13.702
Drop it!

24:15.704 --> 24:17.664
Where do you think
you're going?

24:20.000 --> 24:21.334
Turn around...

24:21.418 --> 24:23.170
slowly.

24:29.342 --> 24:30.594
Drop the gun.

24:30.677 --> 24:31.928
Do it now.

24:32.012 --> 24:35.265
Michael, when you were eight years old...
Save it!

24:35.348 --> 24:36.641
I don't care.

24:38.018 --> 24:39.019
Drop the gun.

24:39.102 --> 24:40.937
Put Scylla
on the ground,

24:41.021 --> 24:42.856
and I'll let you walk
out of here.

24:43.690 --> 24:45.025
If you don't...

24:45.609 --> 24:46.651
I'll kill you.

24:46.735 --> 24:48.778
You can't kill
your mother, Michael.

24:48.862 --> 24:50.822
You were never my mother.

24:50.906 --> 24:52.908
And I'm no longer your son.

24:56.077 --> 24:57.704
Fine.

24:58.705 --> 24:59.998
Then pull the trigger.

25:00.081 --> 25:01.249
Don't tempt me.

25:03.210 --> 25:04.711
Pull the trigger,
Michael.

25:04.794 --> 25:06.129
Do it for Lincoln.

25:06.213 --> 25:07.672
Drop the gun!

25:11.676 --> 25:14.012
You can't do it, can you?

25:20.268 --> 25:22.896
Oh... dear.

25:22.979 --> 25:25.315
Misfire.

25:26.358 --> 25:28.401
You were born a Scofield...

25:29.569 --> 25:31.404
but you'll die
a Burrows.

25:50.590 --> 25:51.633
Okay?

25:51.716 --> 25:53.343
I have to get Lincoln
to the hospital.

25:54.261 --> 25:55.929
I'll get this to Kellerman.

25:59.349 --> 26:00.725
It's all on you again.

26:02.269 --> 26:03.311
Thank you.

26:20.287 --> 26:21.621
Ooh... sorry.

26:22.622 --> 26:24.874
Sorry. Sorry.

26:34.634 --> 26:37.429
Nice and easy.
You're coming with us.

26:37.512 --> 26:38.930
Let's go.

27:05.457 --> 27:06.583
Sorry about all of that.

27:06.666 --> 27:08.585
I had to make sure
you weren't followed.

27:08.668 --> 27:10.086
Solomon Okella
from United Nations.

27:10.170 --> 27:12.589
He's the man
to get this thing done.

27:14.299 --> 27:16.134
Lincoln,

27:16.217 --> 27:17.552
Sara,

27:17.636 --> 27:19.596
Mahone, Sucre.

27:19.679 --> 27:22.682
Exonerated. All of them.

27:26.519 --> 27:28.063
It's okay.

27:43.703 --> 27:45.997
Something's wrong.
There's a piece missing.

27:47.999 --> 27:49.167
What the hell are you doing?

27:49.250 --> 27:50.627
How is someone from the UN

27:50.710 --> 27:52.462
supposed to get us
exonerated here?

27:52.545 --> 27:54.005
You are wasting time, and
we are all in danger.

27:54.089 --> 27:55.674
What is going on here, Paul?

27:55.757 --> 27:57.467
I need to know exactly
who his contacts are

27:57.550 --> 27:58.802
in the U.S. Government.

27:58.885 --> 28:00.303
I've been telling everybody
what a genius you are.

28:00.387 --> 28:01.638
Don't get stupid on me now.

28:01.721 --> 28:02.681
I'm not waiting.

28:02.764 --> 28:04.140
He either has it
or he doesn't.

28:16.903 --> 28:17.946
Michael...

28:18.029 --> 28:19.864
if you have it,

28:20.615 --> 28:22.325
please give it to me,

28:22.409 --> 28:23.660
and we can be done

28:23.743 --> 28:25.704
with all of this finally.

28:26.287 --> 28:27.747
And if you don't,

28:27.831 --> 28:29.833
fine... but just tell me,

28:29.916 --> 28:32.377
so we can hurry up
and run for our lives.

28:46.516 --> 28:48.309
I don't want
to run any more.

28:50.103 --> 28:51.271
Neither do I.

29:33.354 --> 29:34.939
I'll make the call.

29:49.954 --> 29:51.331
You did it.

29:55.460 --> 29:56.753
It's over.

30:30.954 --> 30:32.872
Hands up!

30:34.582 --> 30:36.125
Jonathan Krantz?

30:36.209 --> 30:38.127
General Jonathan Krantz.

30:38.211 --> 30:40.255
Just put your hands
behind your back.

30:42.298 --> 30:43.591
Sir.

30:46.886 --> 30:49.931
Okay,
we got everything we need. We're done.

31:10.785 --> 31:12.370
And this is it?

31:12.453 --> 31:15.331
There will be some follow-up
interviews, but...

31:15.957 --> 31:17.709
this is it.

31:18.918 --> 31:20.211
Sign it,

31:20.295 --> 31:21.713
and you're free to go.

32:21.314 --> 32:22.899
Can I keep the pen?

32:22.982 --> 32:23.942
Sure.

32:37.705 --> 32:39.958
Alex?

32:41.167 --> 32:43.086
Pam's been located.
She's safe.

32:48.091 --> 32:49.300
Mr. Burrows,

32:49.384 --> 32:52.011
Sofia and LJ are
safe, as well.

32:53.388 --> 32:54.889
Police station in Panama.

33:01.104 --> 33:03.731
Now, last bit
of business, um,

33:04.273 --> 33:05.900
Bagwell, T-Bag...

33:07.318 --> 33:08.987
claims he helped
find Scylla.

33:09.070 --> 33:10.905
He was helpful
here in Miami.

33:10.989 --> 33:12.699
He wants
exoneration, as well.

33:14.200 --> 33:15.910
I can make that happen.

33:17.412 --> 33:19.247
I'll leave it up to you.

33:28.506 --> 33:30.591
"And be kind
to one another, tenderhearted,

33:30.758 --> 33:35.054
forgiving each other, just
as God in Christ forgave you."

33:35.138 --> 33:37.056
Ephesians 4:32.
Let's forgive each other,

33:37.140 --> 33:38.808
Lincoln, Michael.

33:38.891 --> 33:40.935
In God's name,
'cause there's too much pain.

33:43.062 --> 33:45.773
There's too much hate
in our hearts.

33:46.941 --> 33:48.359
We took a vote.

33:48.443 --> 33:49.944
You're in luck.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.863
Oh, lucky day!

33:51.946 --> 33:54.741
What we voted on...

33:54.824 --> 33:57.493
was whether or not
you took a stick of gum

33:57.577 --> 33:59.120
on the van ride back...

34:00.163 --> 34:01.831
to prison.

34:05.209 --> 34:07.962
You rot in hell,
both of you!

34:09.714 --> 34:12.633
You're no better than me,
you hear? No...

34:26.481 --> 34:27.940
I want you to know,

34:28.024 --> 34:30.151
I'm totally going to
be a hands-on dad.

34:31.986 --> 34:33.071
Okay.

34:33.154 --> 34:35.031
Like, if the baby needs a bottle
in the middle of the night,

34:35.114 --> 34:38.159
I will totally keep
your side of the bed warm

34:38.242 --> 34:39.535
until you get back.

34:42.330 --> 34:43.790
Thank you.

34:45.291 --> 34:46.834
When do they start walking?

34:46.918 --> 34:49.378
Uh... a year?

34:50.671 --> 34:52.298
We'd better get
some baby books,

34:52.381 --> 34:53.716
Yeah.
because I plan

34:53.800 --> 34:56.177
on being the most
over-informed dad in Chicago.

34:58.429 --> 35:00.139
No kidding.

35:08.314 --> 35:10.817
I'm happy right now.

35:12.151 --> 35:13.694
So am I.

35:26.415 --> 35:27.750
Thanks.

35:32.296 --> 35:33.798
I love you.

35:35.049 --> 35:36.676
I love you, too.

36:27.935 --> 36:29.103
When do you leave?

36:29.187 --> 36:30.855
Eight o'clock.

36:33.316 --> 36:34.984
I'm going to miss you.

36:35.985 --> 36:37.528
I'll be back soon.

36:51.834 --> 36:53.878
Did LJ make any decision?

36:53.961 --> 36:54.879
I made it for him.

36:54.962 --> 36:56.672
I told him
to take his finals.

36:56.756 --> 36:58.382
Next year.

36:58.466 --> 36:59.383
Yeah.

36:59.467 --> 37:01.385
Always next year.

37:01.469 --> 37:02.803
All right, sweetheart.

37:02.887 --> 37:03.846
Love you.

37:03.930 --> 37:05.139
Mmm. Love you, too.

37:09.518 --> 37:11.229
Get home safe.

37:11.312 --> 37:12.813
I will.

37:32.166 --> 37:33.626
Hi.

37:33.709 --> 37:36.921
Daddy's going to come
back in two days, okay?

37:55.982 --> 38:01.946
âª If you've got dreams
in your heart âª

38:05.449 --> 38:09.829
âª Why don't you share them
with me âª

38:12.748 --> 38:16.627
âª And if dreams
don't come true âª

38:16.711 --> 38:23.551
âª I'll make sure that your
nightmares are through âª

38:25.511 --> 38:26.887
It's been a pleasure meeting you,

38:26.971 --> 38:27.805
Congressman
Kellerman.

38:27.888 --> 38:29.598
Pleasure meeting you,
as well.

38:29.682 --> 38:31.183
You fight those bastards
in Washington.

38:32.476 --> 38:33.853
Don't let them
give you any guff.

38:33.936 --> 38:35.688
You know what,
I'm not gonna.

38:35.771 --> 38:37.815
-Thank you again for your support.
-No, thank you.

38:37.898 --> 38:38.774
It's all right.

38:38.858 --> 38:40.359
Thank you.

38:40.443 --> 38:42.486
Remember me, Paul?

38:43.321 --> 38:45.239
I'm Danny Hale's widow.

38:46.032 --> 38:47.158
Remember Danny?

38:47.241 --> 38:48.409
Of course, Allison.

38:48.492 --> 38:50.077
Danny was a true
American hero.

38:51.203 --> 38:52.705
Get her out of here.

38:52.788 --> 38:54.999
It's okay. It's okay.

38:55.082 --> 38:57.251
Congressman, who was that woman?

38:59.545 --> 39:04.717
âª And lay it down slow âª

39:07.762 --> 39:11.682
âª Lay it down free âª

39:14.769 --> 39:20.107
âª Lay it down easy âª

39:22.818 --> 39:25.112
Are you ready, my son?

39:25.196 --> 39:28.449
Semper Paratus.

39:39.835 --> 39:41.879
The captivity of negativity.

39:41.962 --> 39:43.214
That's what it is.

39:43.297 --> 39:44.799
What was that?

39:46.133 --> 39:47.968
It's just this book I got.

39:57.144 --> 40:00.106
I don't ever want
to see this book again.

40:01.065 --> 40:02.149
You hear?

40:02.858 --> 40:04.068
Yes, sir.

40:09.490 --> 40:12.118
âª Lay it down free âª

40:15.496 --> 40:20.835
âª Lay it down easy âª

40:22.670 --> 40:27.800
âª But lay it on me âª

40:29.969 --> 40:34.557
âª If you've got love
in your heart âª

40:34.640 --> 40:36.600
Those right there.

40:36.684 --> 40:39.854
Perfect.
Thank you so much.

40:43.190 --> 40:44.817
Michael, we got to go.

40:50.364 --> 40:51.782
What have you got here?

40:51.866 --> 40:53.993
Oh, you're so tough, huh.

40:58.664 --> 41:00.749
Here you go.
Muchas gracias.

41:00.833 --> 41:02.460
Come on. Let's go
see your daddy.

41:02.543 --> 41:04.628
And thank you
very much, sir.

41:08.007 --> 41:09.049
You want to do a skip?

41:09.550 --> 41:10.843
All right, I'll skip.

41:12.094 --> 41:13.929
âª Skip down! âª

41:14.013 --> 41:15.014
Then on three,
biggest jump you got.

41:15.097 --> 41:17.141
One, two, three!

41:17.224 --> 41:19.977
Not two! On three!

41:20.060 --> 41:22.646
Hey, buddy.

41:24.106 --> 41:25.149
Ooh!

41:25.232 --> 41:27.651
Oh, my goodness.

41:32.198 --> 41:37.995
âª If you've got love
in your heart âª

41:41.540 --> 41:47.213
âª Why don't you keep it
with mine âª

41:49.340 --> 41:54.637
âª I can't promise a miracle âª

41:54.720 --> 42:00.601
âª But I'll always be trying âª

42:03.229 --> 42:08.442
âª And lay it down slow âª

42:11.195 --> 42:16.617
âª Lay it down free âª

42:18.994 --> 42:23.832
âª Lay it down easy âª

42:26.085 --> 42:31.632
âª And lay it on me âª

42:34.009 --> 42:39.223
âª Lay it down easy âª

42:42.142 --> 42:46.146
âª Lay it on me âª

42:49.400 --> 42:54.613
âª Lay it down easy âª

42:57.116 --> 43:00.661
âª Lay it on me. âª
