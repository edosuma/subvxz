Here, I'll let Stevetopus
explain.

10:09.957 --> 10:12.612
You see,
Francine's subconscious

10:12.742 --> 10:14.962
has created manydifferent
versions of you.

10:15.092 --> 10:16.572
Whichever one best fits

10:16.703 --> 10:18.748
her current perception of you
in real life

10:18.879 --> 10:21.621
is the one that's most powerfuland visible at any given moment,

10:21.751 --> 10:24.624
but the rest are always
down here somewhere.

I see.

10:39.769 --> 10:42.990
That's your insecurity --

if she also sees me

10:53.783 --> 10:55.785

10:55.916 --> 10:57.569
There she is now.

10:57.700 --> 10:59.659
I'm gonna go give her
a piece of my mind.

Are you crazy?!

11:02.139 --> 11:03.837
A human dream-stormer

11:03.967 --> 11:05.795
can never let a host become
aware of his presence.

11:05.926 --> 11:08.580
I call it dream-storming,
by the way. Pretty cool, right?

11:08.711 --> 11:11.105
Don't you know the most basic
rules of dream-storming?!

11:11.235 --> 11:12.628
No. Why would I?

Oh, don't try
to turn this around on me.

You're the one

run wild,

thinking me up as some kind
of bunch of Garbage Pail Kids.

11:24.031 --> 11:26.381
I can't believe
you're so insecure

11:26.511 --> 11:29.906

How dare you?!

11:32.953 --> 11:34.650
She's right.

true to his word

11:42.005 --> 11:45.835

11:45.966 --> 11:47.968
And as for Francine,

11:48.098 --> 11:49.709
well, she left Stan

11:49.839 --> 11:53.060
and started having sex
with Jeff for reals.

push the genitals together

12:00.720 --> 12:02.634
and just mash them around.

12:02.765 --> 12:04.288
And why?

12:04.419 --> 12:05.812
Because she knows

12:05.942 --> 12:07.944

-Same as usual.

12:21.349 --> 12:23.220
I just have to touch you both

12:23.351 --> 12:25.919
Then why were you sticking your
fingers in our eyes before?

12:26.049 --> 12:28.965
That's a way of touching.

12:29.096 --> 12:31.098
Since trying to change
how Francine saw me

12:31.228 --> 12:32.926
in the real world didn't work,

12:33.056 --> 12:34.797
I figured I'd do it right here
at the source --

No. I didn't come
to take you home.

19:23.466 --> 19:25.947
Spending time with Stanferatu
made me understand

19:26.077 --> 19:28.036
how awful it feels
when someone you love

19:28.167 --> 19:31.257
won't trust you enough
to just give you some space.

19:31.387 --> 19:33.302
So I only came
to tell you...

19:33.433 --> 19:34.608
I'm sorry.

19:34.738 --> 19:38.133
And if you ever decide
you've had enough space,

19:38.264 --> 19:39.526
I'll be waiting for you.

19:42.529 --> 19:43.878
FRANCINE: Stan?

19:45.967 --> 19:47.273
Thank you.

19:47.403 --> 19:50.189
I knew you would betray me,
Stan!

19:50.319 --> 19:51.929
So I will killyou

19:52.060 --> 19:55.498
and claim Francine for my own!

-[grunting]

20:00.373 --> 20:01.548
Stan!

20:01.678 --> 20:03.332
Stanferatu's too strong for you

20:03.463 --> 20:05.639
-in the dream realm!
-Wait.

20:05.769 --> 20:08.337
His power comes from
my insecurity.

20:08.468 --> 20:11.297
[strains]
Steve, dream us up Jeff.

20:11.427 --> 20:13.386
Hiya.

20:13.516 --> 20:15.301
[groans] If I can be
confident enough

20:15.431 --> 20:18.434
to stand by while Jeff really
works you over...

20:18.565 --> 20:20.349
[strains] that should weaken
Stanferatu enough

20:20.480 --> 20:21.481
for me to defeat him.

20:21.611 --> 20:23.570
I'm not gonna have sex

20:23.700 --> 20:24.919
with Jeff!

20:25.049 --> 20:27.704
[strains] Fine.

20:27.835 --> 20:30.185
Then I'llhave sex
with Jeff.

20:30.316 --> 20:32.187
What?!
How the hell would that...

20:35.146 --> 20:37.236
[growls]

20:37.366 --> 20:40.108
Well, I guess it is
a good distraction.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.283
Dream sword!

20:41.414 --> 20:43.459
[sword shinks]

20:43.590 --> 20:46.593
-[groaning]
-Aah!

20:46.723 --> 20:48.159
Aah!

20:48.290 --> 20:49.900
What a crazy dream.

20:50.031 --> 20:52.729
No more Colonel Buttchug's
Irradiated Sphincter Scorcher

20:52.860 --> 20:54.296
right before bed for me.

20:54.427 --> 20:58.039
Well, maybe just one more
teensy,little taste.

20:59.345 --> 21:02.391
[screams]

21:02.522 --> 21:04.350
Bye! Have a beautiful time!
