WEBVTT

00:01.175 --> 00:02.524
<i>Previously on "Will Trent"...</i>

00:02.524 --> 00:04.221
- Kenny's in the hospital.
- What happened?

00:04.221 --> 00:06.354
Stroke. While doing
the GBI's scutwork.

00:07.485 --> 00:09.313
Good job today, you two.

00:09.313 --> 00:12.447
I think I'm gonna keep
this little experiment going.

00:13.839 --> 00:15.145
I slept with Ormewood.

00:15.145 --> 00:18.192
You and I were on a break,
and I was high.

00:18.192 --> 00:19.845
Why are you telling me this now?

00:19.845 --> 00:22.239
Sick of secrets.

00:29.507 --> 00:32.684
<i>They call him
The Howling Man.</i>

00:32.684 --> 00:35.992
<i>Trapped for eternity
between the worlds</i>

00:35.992 --> 00:39.865
<i>of the living and the dead.</i>

00:39.865 --> 00:43.913
Y'all, the hairs on my neck
are buzzing.

00:43.913 --> 00:48.352
We're standing in the exact spot
my cousin stood

00:48.352 --> 00:51.181
when she heard
The Howling Man's screams

00:51.181 --> 00:52.400
from beyond the grave.

00:53.749 --> 00:58.145
It was so chilling,
her eyebrows turned white.

01:03.237 --> 01:05.065
Yeah, your cousin
was on 'shrooms.

01:08.198 --> 01:09.765
Was that a gun?

01:17.642 --> 01:18.948
Let's go.

01:20.602 --> 01:23.126
We called 911!
I think they hit a deer.

01:25.128 --> 01:26.260
Are you okay?

01:26.260 --> 01:27.609
W-We didn't see him.

01:27.609 --> 01:29.828
Oh, my God!

01:32.222 --> 01:35.051
It's a man. Oh, God.

01:35.051 --> 01:36.966
They hit a man.

01:36.966 --> 01:38.315
He's still breathing.

01:38.315 --> 01:39.969
Where'd he come from?

01:41.492 --> 01:43.755
Do you think
this is The Howling Man?

01:43.755 --> 01:45.366
What's wrong with his eyes?

01:49.761 --> 01:50.936
Just look up.

01:50.936 --> 01:52.416
I'm gonna check
your pupil response.

01:52.416 --> 01:54.201
<i>...extension 4240.</i>

01:54.201 --> 01:57.160
<i>Dr. May, extension 4240.</i>

01:57.160 --> 01:58.727
Faith, I know it's embarrassing,

01:58.727 --> 02:00.468
but you need to be honest
with the doctor. You fainted.

02:00.468 --> 02:02.470
I did not faint. I fell.

02:02.470 --> 02:03.949
But first, her eyes rolled
to the back of her head,

02:03.949 --> 02:06.169
then she was unconscious,
which I call fainting.

02:06.169 --> 02:08.824
You guys keep going,
but we wait much longer,
I can't do stitches.

02:08.824 --> 02:10.782
No! No stitches. If you come
at me with a needle, I'll--

02:10.782 --> 02:12.697
Steri-Strips and glue, then.

02:13.872 --> 02:15.831
Any chance the two of you
are expecting?

02:16.875 --> 02:18.312
Ha!

02:19.226 --> 02:21.358
Sorry. Um, we're not together.

02:21.358 --> 02:24.100
And I am definitely
not having sex,

02:24.100 --> 02:27.103
so unless God himself
is cooking up a plan, then...

02:29.323 --> 02:30.541
Not pregnant.

02:30.541 --> 02:33.153
Well, in that case,
I want to run some tests.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.024
CT, blood work.

02:35.024 --> 02:36.678
Afraid we can't skip
the needle on that one.

02:36.678 --> 02:39.289
Do you, uh,
need to squeeze my hand?

02:39.289 --> 02:41.030
I need you to get out of here.

02:41.030 --> 02:43.032
Okay.

02:54.783 --> 02:56.741
<i>...light southern breeze.</i>

02:56.741 --> 02:59.396
<i>Here's your latest storm
coverage for Metro Atlanta.</i>

02:59.396 --> 03:01.485
<i>As you can see through
Mississippi and across Alabama,</i>

03:01.485 --> 03:02.791
<i>this storm system
is moving in fast.</i>

03:04.271 --> 03:05.794
<i>This storm is coming
from the southwest,</i>

03:05.794 --> 03:08.623
<i>starting just above the Gulf...</i>

03:08.623 --> 03:10.233
Special Agent Will Trent.

03:10.233 --> 03:12.496
How soon can you be down
at St. Peter's Hospital?

03:12.496 --> 03:14.324
Pretty fast.
I'm here with Faith.

03:14.324 --> 03:17.153
Who called you?
Caroline!

03:17.153 --> 03:18.807
No one. I was there.

03:18.807 --> 03:20.939
W-- At the car accident?

03:21.810 --> 03:22.985
What car accident?

03:33.691 --> 03:35.171
Special Agent Will Trent.

03:35.171 --> 03:36.738
Park Police requested you
for a case

03:36.738 --> 03:38.043
down at Stone Mountain.

03:38.043 --> 03:39.436
Possible kidnapping.

03:39.436 --> 03:41.046
Ormewood and Polaski
will meet you there

03:41.046 --> 03:42.178
<i>to give you the details.</i>

03:42.178 --> 03:43.353
It's their case?

03:43.353 --> 03:45.442
It's your case.

03:45.442 --> 03:46.530
Keep me posted.

03:47.662 --> 03:49.968
Push another amp of bicarb.

03:49.968 --> 03:51.492
I need another two units, O neg.

03:51.492 --> 03:52.928
- O2 sats are falling.
- Hey.

03:52.928 --> 03:54.321
- Yes, Doctor!
- Hey. What are you doing here?

03:54.321 --> 03:56.279
- He's losing blood.
- Park Police called me in.

03:56.279 --> 03:59.239
That was fast. No, yeah. G-Good.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.805
We could use you.
This one is...

04:00.805 --> 04:02.154
Call the blood bank.
We're gonna need more blood.

04:02.154 --> 04:04.156
Uh, white male, early 50s,

04:04.156 --> 04:06.202
jumped in front of a car
in the middle of nowhere.

04:06.202 --> 04:09.597
No shirt, no shoes, no ID.
He's not expected to make it.

04:09.597 --> 04:10.815
Ormewood's talking
to the drivers.

04:10.815 --> 04:12.687
We got two other witnesses
at the scene.

04:12.687 --> 04:16.168
Paramedics noticed the ligatures
on the wrists and the ankles.

04:16.168 --> 04:17.344
He's been tortured.

04:17.344 --> 04:18.649
Yeah.

04:18.649 --> 04:19.955
Yeah, I'm surprised
he survived long enough

04:19.955 --> 04:21.086
to get hit by a car.

04:21.086 --> 04:22.392
Start a norepi drip.

04:22.392 --> 04:23.959
Get ready to intubate.
We're gonna lose him!

04:23.959 --> 04:27.310
Damn. I'm gonna try
for a declaration.

04:27.310 --> 04:29.051
Uh, I'm Detective Polaski.

04:29.051 --> 04:30.182
Can you tell me your name?

04:30.182 --> 04:31.967
Do you understand
what's happening?

04:33.360 --> 04:34.578
Tell us who did this.

04:37.146 --> 04:38.452
Timothy.

04:45.023 --> 04:48.331
No pulse.
He's lost too much blood.

04:48.331 --> 04:50.899
Time of death, 19:04.

04:53.118 --> 04:56.208
Ma'am, just take a deep breath
and try to think about

04:56.208 --> 04:57.732
what direction the victim
was headed when you--

04:57.732 --> 05:00.038
Is that poor man
gonna be all right?

05:00.038 --> 05:02.258
I always tell Henry
he drives too fast.

05:02.258 --> 05:05.130
One ticket 10 years ago.
She never lets me forget it.

05:05.130 --> 05:06.436
- Hey, Mom, hey.
- Oh, thank heavens.

05:06.436 --> 05:08.438
Tom, it's been a nightmare.

05:08.438 --> 05:11.223
Yeah, well, let's get you home.
Okay? Come on.

05:11.223 --> 05:12.486
Hi. Detective Ormewood, APD.

05:12.486 --> 05:13.878
I just need to finish
their statements

05:13.878 --> 05:15.053
while the details
are still fresh.

05:15.053 --> 05:16.577
Yeah, well, a crazed man

05:16.577 --> 05:18.666
ran out in front of their car
and almost killed them.

05:18.666 --> 05:20.189
Don't you think they've
had enough for one day?

05:20.189 --> 05:23.279
Look. I get it. You guys
have been through a lot.

05:23.279 --> 05:24.976
Which is why I was hoping
to wrap things up now,

05:24.976 --> 05:27.414
so you won't
have to see me again.

05:27.414 --> 05:29.241
<i>Dr. Bender,
you're needed in pre-op.</i>

05:29.241 --> 05:30.808
<i>Dr. Bender to pre-op.</i>

05:30.808 --> 05:32.288
Well, that was pointless.
They didn't see a damn thing.

05:32.288 --> 05:33.898
- Okay.
- No! No!

05:33.898 --> 05:35.509
What the hell's your
boyfriend doing here, huh?!

05:35.509 --> 05:37.162
What, did you chase
the ambulance here, Trent?

05:37.162 --> 05:38.947
Stay away from my case, okay?!

05:38.947 --> 05:41.036
Okay. Listen.
Park Police called him in.

05:41.036 --> 05:42.907
If we don't play ball,
they can push us off of this.

05:42.907 --> 05:44.561
The guy's a vulture.
And a vampire.

05:44.561 --> 05:45.997
He's a vampire vulture.

05:45.997 --> 05:48.173
He swoops in and he sucks up
people's cases like--

05:48.173 --> 05:50.306
I can hear you--
you know, through the curtain.

05:50.306 --> 05:51.655
Everyone can.

05:51.655 --> 05:53.178
Can you just accept his...

05:53.178 --> 05:55.006
Where have you been?
You have my phone and my wallet.

05:55.006 --> 05:56.356
Where's my purse?

05:56.356 --> 05:59.620
Relax. It's in the car.
So, what'd the tests say?

05:59.620 --> 06:01.578
They all came back positive
for "mind your business."

06:01.578 --> 06:02.710
I am fine.

06:04.233 --> 06:05.887
Are you doing
some sort of magic show?

06:05.887 --> 06:07.671
You are overseeing our case.

06:07.671 --> 06:09.717
Yeah, in the fascist sense
of the word.

06:09.717 --> 06:11.196
You don't even know
what that means.

06:11.196 --> 06:12.850
- Hey, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

06:12.850 --> 06:15.679
Guys. Someone held our victim
against his will, okay?

06:15.679 --> 06:19.117
They burned him, beat him,
cut him. God knows what else.

06:19.117 --> 06:21.206
We're here to help you
try to find that someone.

06:21.206 --> 06:22.904
As a team.

06:22.904 --> 06:24.122
Yes.

06:24.122 --> 06:25.776
Now, I suggest we get
to the crime scene

06:25.776 --> 06:27.996
before the storm that's coming
washes away all our evidence.

06:29.432 --> 06:31.695
What storm?

06:35.612 --> 06:36.961
Tell us about the gunshot.

06:36.961 --> 06:39.660
It sounded like
it came from over there,

06:39.660 --> 06:41.139
but not far away.

06:41.139 --> 06:42.619
You see where
the victim came from?

06:42.619 --> 06:45.187
I asked the driver, but
he just stared off that way.

06:45.187 --> 06:47.711
He might have also
been having a stroke.

06:47.711 --> 06:49.931
Did you see anyone
or hear anything else?

06:49.931 --> 06:52.977
Yeah. We almost got run over
by this jerk.

06:52.977 --> 06:54.501
There was another car?

06:54.501 --> 06:57.286
Yeah, some heartless dick
in a green pickup truck

06:57.286 --> 06:59.462
just blew past us,
hardly even slowed down.

06:59.462 --> 07:01.246
Just rubbernecked
and kept going.

07:01.246 --> 07:03.423
It's like, "Hello!
Man dying in the street."

07:03.423 --> 07:04.772
Have some compassion.

07:04.772 --> 07:06.600
You were recording
the whole time?

07:06.600 --> 07:09.603
It's gonna be our best episode.

07:09.603 --> 07:11.082
We'll need a copy. Thanks.

07:11.082 --> 07:12.562
Then Park Police
will get you home.

07:12.562 --> 07:14.216
All right. Right this way.

07:14.216 --> 07:16.218
Thank you so much.

07:16.218 --> 07:18.438
Gunshot wound was the only thing
our victim didn't have.

07:18.438 --> 07:20.570
Well, if the suspect
fired at him while he fled,

07:20.570 --> 07:22.485
then there's a bullet and
a casing somewhere in there.

07:22.485 --> 07:24.574
Sure, but we gotta wait
for the K-9 guys.

07:26.750 --> 07:28.665
No time. We're going in now.

07:28.665 --> 07:30.972
- All right. Let's roll.
- You heard him. Let's move.

07:30.972 --> 07:32.756
Grab a bag! Let's go!

07:32.756 --> 07:33.801
WOMAN ♪1: Let's go!

07:33.801 --> 07:36.107
WOMAN ♪2:
Passing back your way!

07:36.107 --> 07:39.154
Need one more!

07:41.852 --> 07:43.027
Got a rope here.

07:44.464 --> 07:45.769
It's got blood on it.

07:47.728 --> 07:50.252
Will. Over there.
There's a reflection.

08:04.875 --> 08:07.878
It's a driver's license. Georgia.

08:07.878 --> 08:09.358
Does it belong to our victim?

08:10.838 --> 08:11.969
I don't think so.

08:11.969 --> 08:13.754
Any chance it belongs
to "Timothy"?

08:14.537 --> 08:16.974
It's, uh, covered in dirt.

08:16.974 --> 08:18.323
I don't want to compromise it.

08:31.598 --> 08:32.642
His eyes.

08:36.472 --> 08:38.953
The hell happened
in these woods?

08:48.745 --> 08:49.833
All right. Go.

08:53.010 --> 08:54.403
ORMEWOOD [echoing] :Oh!

08:54.403 --> 08:56.492
Well, you're drinking me
under the table, woman.

08:56.492 --> 08:57.624
How many is that now?

08:57.624 --> 08:59.930
Don't worry about it.
Another round!

09:02.454 --> 09:03.891

09:05.501 --> 09:08.939

09:39.274 --> 09:41.276
This case stirring things up?

09:41.276 --> 09:42.494
Hm.

09:46.890 --> 09:49.719
Ohh. I should try to
make this early NA meeting.

09:51.112 --> 09:53.462
I'm working a big case,
you know, with the GBI.

09:55.333 --> 09:57.640
Yeah.
Hey, can I ask you something?

09:57.640 --> 09:59.816
You know, some people have
a no-dogs-on-the-bed rule.

09:59.816 --> 10:01.296
Yeah.

10:01.296 --> 10:04.429
Is, uh, working with Ormewood
bad for your sobriety?

10:05.648 --> 10:07.432
Funny you should ask,
because my sponsor

10:07.432 --> 10:10.218
thinks sleeping with you
is bad for my sobriety.

10:10.218 --> 10:13.264
Everything's bad
for my sobriety.
I just gotta deal with it.

10:14.483 --> 10:16.572
Is the Ormewood question
about me or about you?

10:17.878 --> 10:19.270
No, not me. I'm good.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.012
So you won't be weird?

10:22.926 --> 10:25.059
No. Not weird at all.

10:25.059 --> 10:26.277
Good.

10:28.976 --> 10:31.239
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

10:38.942 --> 10:41.162
All right, the media's
going wild for this one.

10:41.162 --> 10:43.643
I have a press conference
in an hour. What do we know?

10:44.818 --> 10:46.863
- What happened here?
- Don't worry about it.

10:46.863 --> 10:49.257
Our victims are Arthur Tealy
and Phineas Lathrop.

10:49.257 --> 10:50.693
Middle-aged white men.

10:50.693 --> 10:52.608
Not your typical targets
for this type of crime.

10:52.608 --> 10:54.218
Hm. Nice change of pace.

10:57.874 --> 11:00.050
Well, come in. I don't bite
unless you deserve it.

11:00.050 --> 11:01.182
Where's Polaski?

11:02.183 --> 11:03.924
The snacks in here are amazing.

11:03.924 --> 11:05.186
Are the apples organic?

11:05.186 --> 11:06.796
Yeah, I hear
their printer has toner.

11:06.796 --> 11:08.711
Do you also have valet?

11:08.711 --> 11:12.019
I'm sorry. We're just...
so dazzled by the GBI.

11:14.238 --> 11:15.631
Continue.

11:15.631 --> 11:18.460
For now, we can assume
our victims were abducted, held,

11:18.460 --> 11:20.114
and tortured
by the same suspect.

11:20.114 --> 11:21.724
Our working theory
is that the men were brought

11:21.724 --> 11:24.248
to the woods to be killed
but somehow escaped.

11:24.248 --> 11:27.077
Lathrop climbed a tree here,
probably to hide,

11:27.077 --> 11:28.862
but then his captor
found and shot him.

11:28.862 --> 11:31.908
Moments later, Tealy managed
to reach the road

11:31.908 --> 11:33.736
but was struck
by the Coldfields here.

11:33.736 --> 11:36.391
The question is,
why these men and why torture?

11:36.391 --> 11:39.002
Revenge or information?

11:39.002 --> 11:41.831
We need to establish
a connection. Next of kin?

11:41.831 --> 11:43.311
Interviewing them today.

11:43.311 --> 11:45.661
Can we talk about how
the victims got to the woods?

11:45.661 --> 11:47.228
I keep going back
to the green truck.

11:47.228 --> 11:49.360
Understood, Detective,
but since we have no make,

11:49.360 --> 11:50.884
model, year, or plate number,

11:50.884 --> 11:52.886
let's focus on what we can
learn from the victims.

11:52.886 --> 11:55.192
Yeah, really feeling
that team spirit.

11:55.192 --> 11:57.020
I'll go talk to the M.E.

11:57.020 --> 11:58.152
I'll come with you.

11:58.152 --> 11:59.762
What a treat.

11:59.762 --> 12:02.112
I'll check with the ROCIC,

12:02.112 --> 12:04.985
see if they're following
any similar cases.

12:04.985 --> 12:07.291
You feel okay?
I didn't see you eat breakfast.

12:07.291 --> 12:09.380
How about you use
your keen observation skills

12:09.380 --> 12:10.555
for the case?

12:10.555 --> 12:11.861
I am fine.

12:14.777 --> 12:18.476
Their insides are as messy
as their outsides.

12:18.476 --> 12:20.261
Thanks to this.

12:20.261 --> 12:22.829
We found it
among their clothing.

12:22.829 --> 12:26.006
The jequirity seed,
also known as a prayer bean.

12:26.006 --> 12:27.964
It's newly invasive to Georgia.

12:27.964 --> 12:30.750
When crushed,
it's more toxic than ricin.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.796
And rub a little in the eyes,
and it causes blindness.

12:37.321 --> 12:39.671
He was poisoning them
to keep them weak,

12:39.671 --> 12:42.370
easier to hold captive.

12:42.370 --> 12:44.938
But the blinding...

12:44.938 --> 12:46.243
that feels personal.

12:46.243 --> 12:48.855
Maybe it's punishment.

12:48.855 --> 12:50.073
They saw something
they shouldn't have.

12:52.293 --> 12:53.729
Or he didn't want to be seen.

12:53.729 --> 12:56.166
Hey, Trent.

12:56.166 --> 12:58.299
Take a look at your guy's
right arm.

13:00.040 --> 13:02.433
You're gonna like this.

13:04.871 --> 13:07.656
- The wounds are similar.
- Not just similar. Identical.

13:07.656 --> 13:08.831
All the wounds are.

13:09.963 --> 13:11.268
A ritual.

13:11.268 --> 13:13.836
The torture isn't about them.
It's about him.

13:15.098 --> 13:16.708
You ever see anything like this?

13:16.708 --> 13:19.668
Cigarette burns.
Just a bunch of them.

13:19.668 --> 13:20.800
You sure?

13:20.800 --> 13:23.280
Yeah.

13:28.155 --> 13:29.721
What?

13:29.721 --> 13:31.898
Not everyone appreciates
this part of the investigation.

13:31.898 --> 13:35.423
Ah, Faith can't stomach it, huh?

13:35.423 --> 13:39.340
That's what I love about
Polaski. She's up for anything.

13:40.036 --> 13:42.256
Arthur Tealy
was your father,

13:42.256 --> 13:43.779
and you didn't notice
he was missing?

13:43.779 --> 13:47.914
He took off when I was 8.
We didn't keep in touch.

13:47.914 --> 13:51.787
Which is fine, 'cause
he used to knock Mom around.

13:51.787 --> 13:53.833
And me sometimes.

13:53.833 --> 13:58.838
Phineas and I tried a long time
to make things work.

13:58.838 --> 14:02.711
But after I caught him driving
drunk with the kids again...

14:02.711 --> 14:03.843
I left.

14:03.843 --> 14:06.062
He lost his job,

14:06.062 --> 14:09.979
started drinking more...
if that's possible.

14:09.979 --> 14:11.894
He called once,

14:11.894 --> 14:13.983
at Christmas, all crying,

14:13.983 --> 14:16.812
"I'm sorry I'm a lousy dad."

14:16.812 --> 14:20.076
I thought, "You're not
even a dad. You're a ghost."

14:20.990 --> 14:23.950
His last words were, "Timothy."

14:23.950 --> 14:25.777
Does that mean anything to you?

14:25.777 --> 14:27.649
No.

14:27.649 --> 14:30.304
He's dead.

14:30.304 --> 14:32.654
Lousy end to a lousy life.

14:33.916 --> 14:35.265
What do I tell my kids?

14:35.265 --> 14:38.051
You know, he left
his driver's license

14:38.051 --> 14:39.617
where it would be found.

14:39.617 --> 14:43.491
He knew he wasn't gonna make it,
but he made sure to do that.

14:43.491 --> 14:46.015
I gotta believe...

14:46.015 --> 14:48.322
he was thinking of his family.

14:49.714 --> 14:53.327
So you could have closure,
not have to wonder.

14:57.026 --> 14:58.767
Are you okay?
You're kinda sweaty.

14:58.767 --> 15:01.770
Uh... I'm fine.

15:01.770 --> 15:04.555
If you think of anything else,
let us know.

15:23.792 --> 15:24.793
Faith?

15:24.793 --> 15:26.882
Checking on you.

15:26.882 --> 15:29.058
Will wants us to head back out
to the woods.

15:29.058 --> 15:30.538
Okay. Give me a minute.

15:30.538 --> 15:31.931
Okay.

15:33.802 --> 15:36.065
I swear to God. Polaski!

15:36.065 --> 15:37.675
Yup. Yup.

15:49.949 --> 15:52.038
This should give us
a rough triangulation

15:52.038 --> 15:53.604
of their starting point...

15:53.604 --> 15:56.564
which should be
somewhere around here.

15:56.564 --> 15:58.261
Let me see that.

15:58.261 --> 16:01.003
But the rain washed away
any tire tracks and evidence.

16:01.003 --> 16:03.136
What are we expecting
to find out here?

16:03.136 --> 16:04.833
Where the victims were kept.

16:04.833 --> 16:07.401
The Howling Man was more
than an urban legend.

16:07.401 --> 16:10.882
Park Police confirmed
hikers have reported screams.

16:10.882 --> 16:12.406
But they never found anything.

16:12.406 --> 16:14.495
So you think that instead
of being brought to the woods,

16:14.495 --> 16:16.018
they were here the whole time?

16:16.018 --> 16:18.803
Where? Inside a hollow tree
with the Keebler Elves?

16:18.803 --> 16:20.501
Nearest structures
are miles away from here.

16:20.501 --> 16:22.111
Well, if they would've
been kept out here,

16:22.111 --> 16:23.634
it would've been
in something mobile,

16:23.634 --> 16:25.810
like a trailer
or a camper, right?

16:25.810 --> 16:28.030
They were dumped. The guy drove
them here in that green truck

16:28.030 --> 16:29.945
to finish them off,
and they ran.

16:31.294 --> 16:33.122
Stop! Don't move.

16:35.559 --> 16:37.257
Where's the water going?

16:43.611 --> 16:45.091
Ormewood, move.

16:45.091 --> 16:48.572
Well, which is it?
Don't move? Move?

16:50.052 --> 16:53.882
[muffled] Aah!
Son of a bitch! My ankle!

16:53.882 --> 16:55.449
Trent, you did that on purpose!

16:55.449 --> 16:58.669
- He kept them underground.
- Where no one could find them.

16:58.669 --> 17:01.411
Oh, there's rats!
There's rats down here!

17:15.991 --> 17:18.298

or else I will come and strike

18:13.875 --> 18:16.051
with total destruction."

18:17.357 --> 18:18.358
Bible verses?

18:18.358 --> 18:19.924
Only one.

18:19.924 --> 18:22.188
Written over and over again
by hand.

18:24.755 --> 18:26.105
Check those?

18:28.933 --> 18:30.892
Utility lights
mess with my eyes.

18:37.899 --> 18:40.728
These pages are all brittle.

18:40.728 --> 18:43.078
Same verse,
different handwriting.

18:43.078 --> 18:44.993
Multiple victims.

18:46.168 --> 18:48.475
Each one doing penance
for the same thing.

18:50.216 --> 18:51.565
Being a bad father?

18:53.567 --> 18:55.177
How many people
were in this bunker?

18:55.177 --> 18:57.701
I'll get Angie and Ormewood to
pull missing-persons reports.

18:58.572 --> 19:00.965
We took away his toys
and his playroom.

19:00.965 --> 19:02.967
He's gonna need to
replace them, soon.

19:04.012 --> 19:07.233
Hey, hold on. Hold on.
There's something there.

19:08.059 --> 19:09.974
It's a name.

19:14.979 --> 19:17.199
We do have those kneelers, yes.

19:17.982 --> 19:19.462
Of course, without the, um...

19:19.462 --> 19:21.334
You wouldn't notice one missing?

19:21.334 --> 19:25.642
We sold some of the older ones
in a yard sale a few years back.

19:25.642 --> 19:27.601
Anyone could have them now.

19:27.601 --> 19:30.256
Well, whoever did this
seems connected to the church.

19:30.256 --> 19:33.084
We found bible verses,
uh, prayer beads--

19:33.084 --> 19:37.828
Forgive me, but whoever did that
is a psychopath.

19:37.828 --> 19:41.528
Or they might be using religion
to-- to hide behind,

19:41.528 --> 19:43.312
cherry-pick, justify...

19:44.052 --> 19:46.097
That's not--

19:46.097 --> 19:48.230
All the same,
I'm gonna need you to provide

19:48.230 --> 19:50.363
a list of parishioners,
staff, and volunteers.

19:50.363 --> 19:52.321
Of course,
although we don't really

19:52.321 --> 19:54.715
keep a running list
of those people.

19:54.715 --> 19:56.499
We've got our regulars, sure,

19:56.499 --> 19:59.241
but people are always
dropping in and out.

19:59.241 --> 20:01.330
Plus,
all the community activity.

20:01.330 --> 20:03.506
We host a lot of
outreach programs--

20:03.506 --> 20:07.206
you know, food banks,
AA meetings, things like that.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.512
I mean, someone's
always coming or going.

20:09.512 --> 20:12.602
You'll have to excuse me.
I have an appointment.

20:12.602 --> 20:14.125
I will get you that list.

20:14.125 --> 20:16.171
Appreciate it.

20:16.171 --> 20:18.173
Will, come look at this one.

20:20.871 --> 20:22.395
Read it to me.

20:24.614 --> 20:27.574
It's an ad for jobs.

20:27.574 --> 20:29.315
They wanna hire
"men who are looking

20:29.315 --> 20:31.142
to turn their lives around."

20:31.142 --> 20:32.709
But?

20:32.709 --> 20:34.537
There's a bible verse
at the bottom--

20:34.537 --> 20:36.496
"Fathers must be
men of dignity,

20:36.496 --> 20:38.498
not double-tongued

20:38.498 --> 20:42.066
or addicted to much wine
or fond of sordid gain."

20:42.066 --> 20:45.940
1 Timothy, 3:8.

20:47.724 --> 20:49.465
You think this is our Timothy?

20:50.727 --> 20:52.381
This is how he lures
his victims.

21:01.999 --> 21:05.786
Hiya. I'm Duke.
Excited to hear about this job.

21:21.541 --> 21:23.543
<i>Was that a gun?</i>

21:24.587 --> 21:26.154
Timothy.

21:27.198 --> 21:29.984
I wasted half my day
chasing down that number.

21:29.984 --> 21:31.812
Flyer was a total dead end.

21:31.812 --> 21:34.510
Phone was pay-as-you-go
and no longer activated.

21:34.510 --> 21:36.860
No trace evidence
from the paper.

21:38.949 --> 21:41.387
Since when did you start
carrying protein bars
in your suit?

21:42.170 --> 21:43.867
Got somethin'!
Guy called the tip line

21:43.867 --> 21:45.347
after seeing
Amanda's press conference.

21:45.347 --> 21:46.566
Oh, you should've seen this guy.

21:46.566 --> 21:48.872
He must've been, what,
seven feet tall?

21:48.872 --> 21:51.092
An actual giant. I mean,
you had to see his shoes.

21:51.092 --> 21:53.529
So, he said his friend Duke
went to meet about a job,

21:53.529 --> 21:55.009
and he hasn't heard
from him since.

21:55.009 --> 21:56.358
And Duke found out
about the job

21:56.358 --> 21:57.838
from a flyer at his AA meeting.

21:57.838 --> 22:00.188
Yeah, cruiser called in
a location on Duke's motorcycle.

22:00.188 --> 22:01.885
It's been sitting in front
of a rec center all day.

22:01.885 --> 22:04.148
Great. We'll check it out.

22:04.148 --> 22:05.454
The hell you will.
This is our lead.

22:05.454 --> 22:07.282
It's best you, uh,

22:07.282 --> 22:09.415
stay off crime scenes
while you're injured.

22:09.415 --> 22:11.895
I'm not injured. I'm hurt.
And you're not in charge.

22:11.895 --> 22:13.419
Actually, I am.

22:15.856 --> 22:18.467
Besides, you've been doing
really promising work

22:18.467 --> 22:20.121
with the missing-persons files.

22:20.121 --> 22:22.079
Do some door knocks,
interview families,

22:22.079 --> 22:23.254
whoever filed those reports.

22:23.254 --> 22:25.735
You have a talent
for follow-ups.

22:25.735 --> 22:28.129
You making fun of me? Hmm?

22:28.129 --> 22:31.088
I don't appreciate
your sarcasm, Trent.

22:31.088 --> 22:32.525
Absolutely not.

22:32.525 --> 22:34.744
People enjoy talking to you, Michael.

22:34.744 --> 22:36.703
Maybe we should take
this conversation outside.

22:36.703 --> 22:38.226
Stop it. What is happening?

22:38.226 --> 22:39.836
Stop. Stop. Just stop. Okay.

22:39.836 --> 22:42.143
We are gonna go knock
on some doors, right?

22:43.057 --> 22:45.015
That was some Big Weird Energy.

22:45.015 --> 22:47.453
Eh, if we split up,
we get done faster.

22:47.453 --> 22:48.758
We are not splitting up.
You're injured.

22:48.758 --> 22:50.238
I'm not injured. I'm hurt.

22:50.238 --> 22:52.240
Look. I just want
to finish this. Here.

22:52.240 --> 22:54.242
Okay. Yeah...

22:57.419 --> 22:58.594
<i>Was that a gun?</i>

23:04.861 --> 23:07.777
Again? Will, we're here.
Let's go.

23:07.777 --> 23:09.083
There's something off.

23:10.389 --> 23:12.478
I just can't focus.

23:13.653 --> 23:15.698
<i>Was that a gun?</i>

23:21.704 --> 23:23.053
<i>Was that a gun?</i>

23:25.578 --> 23:27.623
<i>We called 911!</i>

23:29.059 --> 23:30.757
I had no idea
you were this much fun.

23:30.757 --> 23:32.280
- Stop!
- Hey!

23:32.280 --> 23:34.325
Ease up!

23:34.325 --> 23:36.284
We'll figure it out.

23:41.071 --> 23:45.119
I keep on ruminating about
some... other personal stuff.

23:45.119 --> 23:46.468
Angie?

23:46.468 --> 23:47.991
- Maybe.
- Hm.

23:47.991 --> 23:50.864
My stupid detective brain
doesn't have an off switch.

23:50.864 --> 23:52.343
Sometimes I wish it did.

23:52.343 --> 23:54.781
Yeah, obsessive looping
thoughts. I know them well.

23:54.781 --> 23:56.478
You want to talk about it?

23:56.478 --> 23:58.698
- No.
- Yeah, copy that. Come on.

23:58.698 --> 24:01.222
They probably met over here,
away from people.

24:02.353 --> 24:04.007
Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey.

24:04.007 --> 24:07.010
Come on. Come on.
It's okay.

24:08.447 --> 24:09.622
All right.

24:10.623 --> 24:12.363
All right.
What do you need, huh?

24:12.363 --> 24:14.104
Juice? Insulin?
Where's your injector?

24:14.104 --> 24:16.237
Damn it, Trent!

24:16.237 --> 24:19.980
I am a person, dealing
with a personal matter.

24:19.980 --> 24:21.590
Stop treating
the people in your life

24:21.590 --> 24:23.113
like they are crime scenes.

24:23.113 --> 24:24.680
It is hard enough
being diagnosed

24:24.680 --> 24:26.073
with diabetes in your 30s

24:26.073 --> 24:28.467
without having Scooby-Doo
breathing down your neck.

24:32.296 --> 24:34.603
Ezra McCarvin had diabetes.

24:34.603 --> 24:37.388
He was one of the little kids I
looked after in the group home.

24:38.999 --> 24:42.132
I can help you. If you want.

24:45.484 --> 24:48.138
It's the needles.

24:49.357 --> 24:52.142
And how did you know, anyway?

24:52.142 --> 24:54.623
Fainting. Dead giveaway.

24:57.452 --> 24:59.628
Change of eating habits.

24:59.628 --> 25:00.977
Band-Aids on your fingers.

25:00.977 --> 25:04.938
As far as cases go,
it was a piece of cake.

25:04.938 --> 25:07.157
Which you can't have anymore.

25:07.157 --> 25:08.202
Blood-sugar humor.

25:08.202 --> 25:10.247
Not funny.

25:10.247 --> 25:13.468
You know...
you could've told me.

25:14.251 --> 25:15.862
Like you tell me
all your secrets?

25:17.951 --> 25:20.519
You are not the only
detective here, Will.

25:21.563 --> 25:23.478
Were you ever gonna tell me
about your reading?

25:26.394 --> 25:29.266
Look. I get it. You don't want
people treating you different,

25:29.266 --> 25:31.094
wondering if you can
do your job or not.

25:34.707 --> 25:36.491
Now you know how I feel.

25:38.754 --> 25:40.364
You want me to do this or what?

25:45.587 --> 25:47.110
Go on.

25:52.202 --> 25:54.596
Hmm. Not bad.

25:54.596 --> 25:55.902
Mm-hmm.

25:57.643 --> 25:58.861
What?

25:58.861 --> 26:00.428
Wait.

26:03.474 --> 26:04.780
It's confetti.

26:10.438 --> 26:12.919
Plastic, like from
a taser cartridge.

26:15.443 --> 26:17.314
Duke was taken.

26:17.314 --> 26:18.925
Most people don't realize

26:18.925 --> 26:21.492
that when a taser is fired,
it releases AFIDs--

26:21.492 --> 26:23.930
Anti-Felon
Identification Disks--

26:23.930 --> 26:27.411
each with its own serial number
that traces back to the buyer.

26:27.411 --> 26:29.718
The number on these,
they trace back to you.

26:31.024 --> 26:32.939
Why does a pastor need a taser?

26:32.939 --> 26:34.636
Well, I--

26:34.636 --> 26:37.857
The church bought one years ago
for security purposes.

26:37.857 --> 26:39.380
It's never been used.

26:39.380 --> 26:42.035
Where'd you go when you left us
yesterday afternoon?

26:42.035 --> 26:44.472
I had an appointment.

26:44.472 --> 26:45.691
With Duke Ulrich?

26:45.691 --> 26:47.083
With my dentist.

26:47.083 --> 26:49.695
We found the kneeler
that came from your church.

26:49.695 --> 26:53.133
A flyer for recruiting victims,
also from your church.

26:53.133 --> 26:54.656
And a taser cartridge
that was used

26:54.656 --> 26:58.399
on our latest assumed victim,
registered in your name.

26:58.399 --> 27:02.142
I gotta say, Pastor.
You're making me a believer.

27:04.753 --> 27:07.887
I think I'd like
to speak with my attorney now.

27:08.975 --> 27:11.281
You're here
about Paul? I don't know.

27:11.281 --> 27:13.719
It's been three years
since I filed that report.

27:13.719 --> 27:16.286
Um, uh,
when he first disappeared,

27:16.286 --> 27:19.812
I was a mess,
but sometimes I just feel like

27:19.812 --> 27:21.248
he walked out on me.

27:21.248 --> 27:23.163
That's what he did
the first time.

27:23.163 --> 27:24.381
What do you mean?

27:24.381 --> 27:28.211
Paul's wife, his kids--
he left them for me.

27:29.604 --> 27:32.651
Paul ever go to any meetings,
like AA?

27:32.651 --> 27:34.435
He ever mention
a flyer about a job?

27:34.435 --> 27:36.480
I don't think so.

27:36.480 --> 27:38.613
What about church? Did he go?

27:38.613 --> 27:40.528
Paul wasn't
the church-y type.

27:40.528 --> 27:43.096
There was this guy who worked
odd jobs at the dairy farm.

27:43.096 --> 27:45.881
He would walk past our house
every day on his way to work,

27:45.881 --> 27:48.405
and he would always give Paul
an earful about God,

27:48.405 --> 27:52.235
how fathers who left their kids
are going to hell.

27:52.235 --> 27:54.629
And Paul--
he would just laugh it off

27:54.629 --> 27:56.022
and say that
he's already been to hell,

27:56.022 --> 27:57.458
that's why he left his wife.

27:57.458 --> 28:01.244
Oh, he was a jerk.

28:01.244 --> 28:02.376
I miss him.

28:02.376 --> 28:03.812
Remember anything
about this guy?

28:03.812 --> 28:06.728
Young. Brown hair.

28:06.728 --> 28:07.860
Patchy beard.

28:08.730 --> 28:11.690
Got an address for that farm?

28:14.910 --> 28:17.826
Hey, Jimmy, I need you
to dig up employment records

28:17.826 --> 28:19.045
for Dresner Dairy.

28:19.045 --> 28:21.395
Looks like it's been closed
for a while.

28:21.395 --> 28:23.702
Yeah, and if you can, find
the number for a supervisor,

28:23.702 --> 28:25.834
see if there were people
working here off the books

28:25.834 --> 28:28.576
about three years ago.

28:28.576 --> 28:30.404
Yeah.

28:30.404 --> 28:31.448
Thanks.

29:00.913 --> 29:04.220
<i>Her eyebrows turned white.</i>

29:04.220 --> 29:05.700
<i>Yeah, your cousin
was on 'shrooms.</i>

29:11.445 --> 29:12.794
<i>Was that a gun?</i>

29:18.539 --> 29:21.716
Will, stop it. Just listen.

29:30.464 --> 29:32.466
That's it.

29:34.642 --> 29:35.948
Will, what are you doing?!

29:35.948 --> 29:37.950
I said I want
to speak to my lawyer.

29:37.950 --> 29:40.039
Judith and Henry Coldfield.
Do they have any connection
to your church?

29:40.039 --> 29:42.215
- The Coldfields?
- The recording--

29:42.215 --> 29:43.782
Their car hit Arthur
straight on.

29:43.782 --> 29:46.175
No horn, no brakes,
not until after.

29:46.175 --> 29:47.263
They were trying to kill him.

29:47.263 --> 29:49.004
I know Judith.

29:49.004 --> 29:50.614
We sheltered her
many years back,

29:50.614 --> 29:52.051
before the death
of her first husband.

29:54.357 --> 29:57.056
He was a monster.

30:03.366 --> 30:05.804
No one should suffer like this.

30:08.589 --> 30:10.852
Did you know Judith
when this was going on?

30:10.852 --> 30:14.334
Yes, we met at church when
she was married to Travis.

30:14.334 --> 30:17.206
Oh, so did you kill him for her?

30:18.555 --> 30:19.818
Or did you do it together?

30:21.907 --> 30:23.517
Whose idea was it
to do it again?

30:23.517 --> 30:27.651
To find other men
who deserved to be punished

30:27.651 --> 30:29.479
and do unto them
as Travis did to you?

30:32.526 --> 30:34.441
You searched
for men like Travis,

30:34.441 --> 30:36.878
canvassing churches, shelters,
truck stops

30:36.878 --> 30:38.880
all around the state,
and that's how you found

30:38.880 --> 30:41.796
Arthur Tealy
and Phineas Lathrop.

30:41.796 --> 30:45.060
Punishing them for the pain
that they caused their family.

30:45.060 --> 30:46.366
And killing them.

30:48.150 --> 30:49.760
Yes.

30:51.806 --> 30:54.417
And what about Duke Ulrich?
Where is he?

30:56.550 --> 30:57.986
Who shot the guy in the tree?

31:00.989 --> 31:03.644
Someone who was also hurt
by Travis.

31:04.863 --> 31:07.039
Someone you've been protecting
in a way you couldn't

31:07.039 --> 31:08.910
when he was a boy.

31:10.346 --> 31:12.783
Your son. Tom.

31:26.536 --> 31:29.235
Will. Polaski's worried.

31:29.235 --> 31:30.932
Says Ormewood is missing.

31:33.979 --> 31:35.937
What's his last known location?

32:04.835 --> 32:06.620
Are you afraid of me?

32:06.620 --> 32:08.665
Or are you afraid of God?

32:08.665 --> 32:11.364
Whatever you want.

32:12.669 --> 32:13.801
Good boy.

32:17.848 --> 32:19.024
Aah!

32:23.071 --> 32:25.334
My father used to always say...

32:25.334 --> 32:28.642
"Destruction of
the transgressors

32:28.642 --> 32:30.644
and of the sinners...

32:30.644 --> 32:33.038
shall be together."

32:37.738 --> 32:39.653
Aah!

32:39.653 --> 32:44.049
"And they that forsake the Lord
shall be put to an end."

32:53.623 --> 32:56.104
Please. Let us go.

32:57.584 --> 33:00.065
No discipline seems pleasant
at the time...

33:00.065 --> 33:02.589
but painful.

33:03.590 --> 33:06.245
Later on, it produces a harvest

33:06.245 --> 33:07.463
of righteousness and peace

33:07.463 --> 33:09.639
for those
who were trained by it.

33:19.040 --> 33:20.824
So this is what your father
did to you?

33:22.565 --> 33:24.393
He hurt you
in a place like this?

33:26.221 --> 33:27.918
It was a storm cellar.

33:30.008 --> 33:32.010
Look at you.

33:32.010 --> 33:33.054
Tommy.

33:35.622 --> 33:36.884
You're just like him.

33:38.842 --> 33:41.541
When's it time
for you to repent, huh?

33:42.672 --> 33:45.153
Oh, come on. Tommy...

33:45.153 --> 33:46.676
Don't call me that.

33:46.676 --> 33:48.243
Why'd you bring me here?

33:48.243 --> 33:51.072
Is it 'cause I remind you
of him? Hm?

33:55.903 --> 33:58.558
Tell me.
Why do you blind them?

34:00.647 --> 34:01.909
Is it 'cause
you don't want us to see

34:01.909 --> 34:04.390
how weak and pathetic you are?

34:04.390 --> 34:05.608
What'd you say?

34:05.608 --> 34:07.175
You're a disgrace
to your family.

34:07.175 --> 34:08.655
You always have been.

34:08.655 --> 34:11.353
And no matter what you do,
you'll always just be

34:11.353 --> 34:14.182
a whiny, filthy little sinner!

34:14.182 --> 34:15.749
Shut up!

34:29.937 --> 34:31.460
Let's get eyes in the sky.

34:31.460 --> 34:33.114
MAN ♪2: Copy that.

34:33.114 --> 34:34.768
<i>MAN ♪3: ...the perimeter.
Securing the location.</i>

34:54.179 --> 34:56.659
Quiet. Quiet.

35:52.106 --> 35:54.500
Shh! Quiet. Hey. Quiet.

36:15.956 --> 36:17.871
Aah!

36:17.871 --> 36:19.916
It's okay.

36:26.575 --> 36:27.924
Drop your weapon!

36:35.410 --> 36:37.151
She said, "Drop your weapon."

36:49.294 --> 36:51.034
Get paramedics in here.

36:56.997 --> 37:00.261
- All right. Bring the kit.
- Here. Help him. Help him.

37:00.261 --> 37:01.915
It's gonna be all right, sir.

37:01.915 --> 37:05.527
Hello, sir. I'm gonna
check your vitals, okay?

37:08.182 --> 37:09.966
You should let someone
take a look at you.

37:09.966 --> 37:13.187
Oh, God.
What are you, my mother?

37:13.187 --> 37:15.102
You should talk to someone
who'll listen, Trent.

37:30.030 --> 37:32.728
So, green truck.

37:37.646 --> 37:39.126
Told you.

37:46.481 --> 37:49.571
People carry their trauma
in different ways.

37:51.530 --> 37:53.096
It's never an excuse...

37:56.491 --> 37:58.580
...but it can be a reason.

38:00.278 --> 38:01.322
Can I come in?

38:01.322 --> 38:03.237
Yeah.

38:04.194 --> 38:07.763
I called the endocrinologist.
I'm dealing with everything.

38:07.763 --> 38:09.852
Good.

38:09.852 --> 38:11.550
Don't you find
hiding your secret

38:11.550 --> 38:12.899
more stressful than it's worth?

38:13.682 --> 38:14.727
Amanda knows.

38:14.727 --> 38:15.989
Yeah, I figured.

38:15.989 --> 38:18.731
But... everyone else?

38:18.731 --> 38:19.862
Hm.

38:21.908 --> 38:24.040
Before I had dyslexia,
you know what I had?

38:25.346 --> 38:26.782
"Stupid."

38:26.782 --> 38:29.872
"Lazy." "Useless."

38:29.872 --> 38:32.571
I got cigarette burns
for fetching

38:32.571 --> 38:35.356
the wrong kind of soup
from the pantry.

38:36.401 --> 38:39.665
So I learned how to tell
the difference in other ways.

38:40.796 --> 38:43.930
Figured out how to navigate
the world without words.

38:45.714 --> 38:47.368
Every step of the way,
there was someone there

38:47.368 --> 38:49.675
to tell me that I was...

38:49.675 --> 38:53.418
broken... worthless.

38:56.290 --> 38:59.337
I decided a long time ago
that I'm not letting anyone

38:59.337 --> 39:01.991
look at me that way ever again.

39:02.644 --> 39:06.953
You know that having dyslexia
does not make you broken, right?

39:06.953 --> 39:09.216
Oh, yeah. I do.

39:10.913 --> 39:15.048
But... knowing it
and believing it

39:15.048 --> 39:17.311
are two entirely
different things.

39:19.400 --> 39:21.359
All right.

39:25.754 --> 39:28.191
See you tomorrow... partner?

39:30.150 --> 39:31.543
And for what it's worth...

39:31.543 --> 39:35.677
the thing that you're
circling about Angie...

39:35.677 --> 39:37.375
I don't think
it's really about her.

39:39.942 --> 39:41.770
I think you're trying
to figure out...

39:41.770 --> 39:43.337
how to not get hurt again.

39:45.818 --> 39:47.689
And there is no solve
for that, Will.

39:49.343 --> 39:50.910
Comes with being human.

40:00.963 --> 40:02.443
How's Ormewood?

40:03.444 --> 40:06.012
He's fine. He's with his family.

40:06.012 --> 40:09.450
He's still my partner.

40:09.450 --> 40:11.147
I could arrange for him
to go away.

40:11.147 --> 40:13.236
Oh, you had your chance
at the dairy farm.

40:13.236 --> 40:15.325
And you saved his life,
you sucker.

40:20.374 --> 40:22.115
Did you build that?

40:22.115 --> 40:23.421
Mm-hmm.

40:23.421 --> 40:26.336
What is it
with you and this dog?

40:27.425 --> 40:30.558
Abandoned, misunderstood, underestimated.

40:30.558 --> 40:31.777
I mean, what's not to love?

40:32.865 --> 40:34.257
I was thinking about the case.

40:35.824 --> 40:37.478
All those victims,

40:37.478 --> 40:39.349
and nobody noticed
they were missing.

40:40.786 --> 40:42.396
Betty would notice
you're missing.

40:47.532 --> 40:49.664
I wish you told me sooner
about Ormewood.

40:51.100 --> 40:52.362
I know.

40:57.280 --> 40:59.457
Are you worried
I'm gonna start using again?

41:00.458 --> 41:02.416
Angie, I know all of you.

41:02.416 --> 41:04.418
And I'm not scared.

41:05.680 --> 41:07.726
I'm here.

41:08.901 --> 41:10.293
Maybe that scares you, though.

41:11.033 --> 41:12.034
Shut up.

41:15.255 --> 41:17.823
Yeah, okay. Maybe it does.

41:20.434 --> 41:23.872
Taking everything one day
at a time, you know? I'm trying.

41:27.310 --> 41:29.399
That's all I can say.

41:31.663 --> 41:35.014
How about the next time
you want to run...

41:35.014 --> 41:36.450
give it 24 hours.

41:36.450 --> 41:37.930
See if it passes.
