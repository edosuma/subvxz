18:27.314 --> 18:31.945
friendship test and I failed it.

18:31.986 --> 18:33.821
On purpose.

18:33.863 --> 18:36.074
Why would you do that?

18:36.115 --> 18:38.659
Sorry, listening.

18:38.701 --> 18:41.370
The Cutie Mark Crusaders

18:38.701 --> 18:41.370
wanted to go to this school

18:41.412 --> 18:42.956
more than anything.

18:42.997 --> 18:47.001
So I thought if I showed

18:42.997 --> 18:47.001
Headmare Twilight

18:47.043 --> 18:50.880
they're bad at friendship, she'd

18:47.043 --> 18:50.880
let them come here with me!

18:50.922 --> 18:52.673
That's devious!

18:52.715 --> 18:54.759
I mean... I see.

18:54.801 --> 18:56.176
[sip]

18:56.218 --> 18:59.931
I guess I still have a lot

18:56.218 --> 18:59.931
to learn about friendship.

18:59.973 --> 19:02.600
Actually, I think

18:59.973 --> 19:02.600
you're doing all right.

19:02.642 --> 19:05.103
Sure, that was a

19:02.642 --> 19:05.103
really, really bad way

19:05.144 --> 19:06.938
to try to help

19:05.144 --> 19:06.938
your friends.

19:06.980 --> 19:10.190
But what matters

19:06.980 --> 19:10.190
is, you wanted to.

19:10.232 --> 19:12.401
The reason the Cutie Mark

19:10.232 --> 19:12.401
Crusaders don't go to this

19:12.443 --> 19:15.446
school is that they'd make

19:12.443 --> 19:15.446
better teachers than students!

19:15.488 --> 19:17.991
So you do have a

19:15.488 --> 19:17.991
place for them here?

19:18.032 --> 19:19.951
Hmmm.

19:19.993 --> 19:25.832
[chatter]

19:25.873 --> 19:29.043
I bet there's no Wonderful

19:25.873 --> 19:29.043
World of Cleaning lesson

19:29.085 --> 19:30.795
at Twilight's school.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.713
[cough]

19:32.755 --> 19:34.924
We'll never find out now.

19:34.966 --> 19:36.717
[sigh]

19:36.759 --> 19:39.012
I still don't get how

19:36.759 --> 19:39.012
Cozy failed her test

19:39.053 --> 19:40.972
after all that studying!

19:41.014 --> 19:43.557
Or how Twilight could

19:41.014 --> 19:43.557
blame us for it!

19:43.599 --> 19:46.144
Or how gum can be so sticky!

19:46.185 --> 19:47.812
[knocking]

19:47.854 --> 19:50.106
Sorry to interrupt,

19:47.854 --> 19:50.106
Miss Cheerilee,

19:50.148 --> 19:53.192
but can I borrow Apple Bloom,

19:50.148 --> 19:53.192
Sweetie Belle, and Scootaloo?

19:55.486 --> 20:02.493
<i>♪ [sombre military music] ♪</i>

20:05.371 --> 20:07.915
We didn't do anything

20:05.371 --> 20:07.915
wrong, we promise!

20:07.957 --> 20:10.126
I know that. Now.

20:10.168 --> 20:12.170
Which is why I wanted

20:10.168 --> 20:12.170
to talk to you.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.797
Wait. So we're

20:12.211 --> 20:14.797
not in trouble?

20:14.839 --> 20:16.215
Just the opposite.

20:16.256 --> 20:19.093
Cozy Glow, is there

20:16.256 --> 20:19.093
something you'd like to say?

20:19.135 --> 20:21.971
This is all my fault.

20:22.013 --> 20:24.473
I messed up my

20:22.013 --> 20:24.473
test on purpose,

20:24.515 --> 20:26.600
so we could all go

20:24.515 --> 20:26.600
to school together!

20:26.642 --> 20:28.644
I'm sorry.

20:28.686 --> 20:30.270
Thank you, Cozy Glow.

20:30.312 --> 20:32.481
Honesty is one of the

20:30.312 --> 20:32.481
pillars of friendship.

20:32.523 --> 20:34.483
But you already know that.

20:34.525 --> 20:36.235
Which is why I'd like

20:34.525 --> 20:36.235
to give you these.

20:43.325 --> 20:45.285
They're honorary diplomas,

20:45.327 --> 20:48.956
making y'all official

20:45.327 --> 20:48.956
graduates of this here school.

20:48.998 --> 20:50.875
You've more than

20:48.998 --> 20:50.875
earned them.

20:50.917 --> 20:52.668
Without even

20:50.917 --> 20:52.668
having to study!

20:58.799 --> 21:01.010
Yeah!

21:01.052 --> 21:06.515
We are grad-u-ates!

21:06.557 --> 21:09.393
And, if you're interested, I

21:06.557 --> 21:09.393
think Starlight has a place

21:09.435 --> 21:11.729
for you at my school after all.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.189
We can stay?

21:11.771 --> 21:13.189
Really?

21:11.771 --> 21:13.189
Wooo hooo!

21:13.231 --> 21:15.775
We could use some good

21:13.231 --> 21:15.775
friendship tutors on staff.

21:15.816 --> 21:18.485
And I hear you're

21:15.816 --> 21:18.485
the best out there.

21:18.527 --> 21:20.071
Then what're we

21:18.527 --> 21:20.071
waiting for?

21:20.113 --> 21:22.156
Let's get tutoring!

21:22.198 --> 21:24.533
C'mon, Cozy!

21:24.575 --> 21:28.454
And that's why this school needs

21:24.575 --> 21:28.454
you as our guidance counselor.
