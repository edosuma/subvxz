Yeah! Chase or Wild?

00:50.984 --> 00:52.552
- Go, Wild!
- Do it, Wild!

00:52.619 --> 00:54.053
BOTH:
Go, Chase!

00:56.156 --> 00:59.526
Oh, Adventure Bay's
first ever space exhibition,

00:59.592 --> 01:02.662
featuring the adorable
Captain Gordy!

01:02.729 --> 01:04.697
Isn't it science-tastic?

01:04.764 --> 01:06.266
It sure is, Auntie.

01:06.332 --> 01:08.535
I wanna be an astronaut
when I grow up.

01:08.601 --> 01:10.303
When can we go
on the rocket ship?

01:10.370 --> 01:12.906
Sorry, Julius,
that's a real rocket.

01:12.972 --> 01:15.442
But Captain Gordy
is a trained professional

01:15.508 --> 01:18.144
and is going to show everyone
how it works later.

01:18.211 --> 01:20.547
CROWD:
Woohoo!

01:20.613 --> 01:22.582
But you can still go
on the Spin-a-lot!

01:22.649 --> 01:25.718
Cool! That's how
real astronauts train.

01:28.755 --> 01:30.390
(Clucking)

Wow!

01:39.532 --> 01:40.567
Oh, no!

01:40.633 --> 01:42.635
Who started up
that rocket?

01:42.702 --> 01:43.903
JULIA:
Look, Auntie!

01:43.970 --> 01:46.306
Chickaletta is gonna be
the first chicken in space!

01:46.372 --> 01:47.540
Actually, that's not accurate

01:47.607 --> 01:50.577
since that spacecraft's
soaring sideways!

01:50.643 --> 01:51.878
No!

01:54.914 --> 01:57.150
I can't wait to see
that rocket ship!

01:59.319 --> 02:01.087
Oh-ho! It came to me!

02:01.154 --> 02:03.256
Wait. Is that Chickaletta?

02:03.323 --> 02:04.891
I must call
the PAW Patrol!

02:07.126 --> 02:09.162
Okay. On your mark.

02:09.229 --> 02:10.730
Get set--

02:10.797 --> 02:12.899
(Tablet ringing)

02:12.966 --> 02:14.734
Francois? Are you okay?

02:14.801 --> 02:18.905
I am fine, but this Chickaletta
statue has been knocked over

02:18.972 --> 02:21.040
by Chickaletta
in a rocket ship!

02:21.107 --> 02:22.375
(Tablet ringing)

02:22.442 --> 02:24.844
Ryder? You're never
going to believe this,

02:24.911 --> 02:27.914
but something went wrong
at the space exhibition and--

02:27.981 --> 02:29.949
Chickaletta got launched
in a rocket?

02:30.016 --> 02:31.050
Where is it now?

02:31.117 --> 02:33.019
I don't know!
It zips here.

02:33.086 --> 02:35.688
- It zips there.
- It zips everywhere!

02:35.755 --> 02:37.724
Too fast
for anyone to catch!

02:37.790 --> 02:39.559
We'll see about that.

02:39.626 --> 02:41.661
No wrong way rocket's
too fast.

02:41.728 --> 02:43.263
No pup is too small.

02:43.329 --> 02:45.798
We'll need some
super speedy rescuers.

02:45.865 --> 02:47.834
(Beeping)

02:47.901 --> 02:51.471

02:58.278 --> 02:59.479

03:01.514 --> 03:02.882
Whoa-oh-oh!

(Beeping)

03:39.152 --> 03:40.420
Glad to hear it.

03:40.486 --> 03:42.855
Chickaletta is trapped
on an out of control rocket.

03:42.922 --> 03:43.957
(Clucking)

03:44.023 --> 03:46.192
Oh, no!
How will we stop it?

03:46.259 --> 03:48.861
We'll have to catch up to it
and turn off its power supply.

03:48.928 --> 03:49.963
So, for this mission,

03:50.029 --> 03:52.599
I'll need our two
fastest rescuers.

03:52.665 --> 03:56.102
Mighty Chase, I'll need you
to use your super speed

03:56.169 --> 03:59.639
to catch up to the rocket,
hop on top, and turn it off.

03:59.706 --> 04:02.208
Mighty Chase
can keep up the pace!

04:02.275 --> 04:04.644
Thanks, Chase,
but you'll need some help.

04:04.711 --> 04:09.115
Wild, I'll need you to go
just as fast as Mighty Chase

04:09.182 --> 04:11.351
to help him
stop that rocket.

04:11.417 --> 04:12.819
Cheetah speed!

04:12.885 --> 04:15.021
I bet I can go even faster!

04:15.088 --> 04:16.155
You're on!

04:16.222 --> 04:17.724
Mighty Skye and Leo,

04:17.790 --> 04:20.093
I'll need your whirlwind
and super strength

04:20.159 --> 04:22.562
to move stuff
out of the rocket's way

04:22.629 --> 04:23.896
until we can stop it.

04:23.963 --> 04:27.133

it's coming to us!

Chase! We've gotta keep it

06:10.837 --> 06:13.272
Uh-oh.
It's headed back to town!

06:13.339 --> 06:15.408
Skye, Leo, get ready.

06:15.475 --> 06:17.477
That runaway rocket's
headed your way.

06:17.543 --> 06:18.811
Clear a path for it.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.282
On it!

06:23.349 --> 06:25.818
(Barking)
Whirlwind power!

06:27.286 --> 06:28.955
(Zooming)

06:29.021 --> 06:30.356
Close call, Ryder.

06:30.423 --> 06:32.525
But now it's headed
for the water tower!

06:32.592 --> 06:35.394
Leo, use your strength
to save the water tower.

06:37.497 --> 06:40.967
Roar!
Lion strength!

06:43.936 --> 06:45.972
- Paw-esome!
- Thanks for the lift, Leo!

06:46.038 --> 06:47.406
(Grunting)

06:48.574 --> 06:50.777
It got away from us again,
Ryder!

06:50.843 --> 06:51.844
We're fast enough
to catch it,

06:51.911 --> 06:53.713
but we never know
where it's going!

06:53.780 --> 06:56.415
I know just the cat
who can figure it out.

06:56.482 --> 06:58.451
Shade, how soon
can you get here?

06:58.518 --> 06:59.786
How 'bout right now?

06:59.852 --> 07:02.054
Wow, that was fast!

07:03.422 --> 07:05.391
Shade, we need you to figure out

07:05.458 --> 07:07.960
where an out of control rocket
is headed next.

07:08.027 --> 07:09.061
(Beeping)

07:09.128 --> 07:11.364
Wow, seems like
a random route.

07:11.430 --> 07:14.467
But I bet
there's a pattern there.

07:14.534 --> 07:16.569
Calculating, now.

07:16.636 --> 07:19.071
(Beeping)

07:19.138 --> 07:21.641

07:21.707 --> 07:22.909
Agh, not again!

07:22.975 --> 07:25.077
Chase, Wild, stand by.

07:25.144 --> 07:27.446
Shade is figuring out
the rocket's path.

07:27.513 --> 07:30.583
I factored in the wind velocity,
the rocket's thrust,

07:30.650 --> 07:32.585
and thermal updrafts.

07:32.652 --> 07:34.754
Um, what does that mean?

07:34.821 --> 07:37.323
It means the rocket's
about to turn back

07:37.390 --> 07:39.058
towards the space exhibition!

07:39.125 --> 07:41.661
Heading there now.
Cheetah speed!

07:44.931 --> 07:47.600
Auntie, I know you're worried
about Chickaletta,

07:47.667 --> 07:49.435
and so are we, but--

07:49.502 --> 07:51.037
The Spin-a-lot
looks so fun!

07:51.103 --> 07:53.773
And the PAW Patrol
are going to rescue Chickaletta.

07:53.840 --> 07:55.775
And I really wanna be
an astronaut!

07:55.842 --> 07:57.009
Can we try the ride?

07:57.076 --> 07:59.378
Okay, but let me
check it out first.

08:00.479 --> 08:02.782
Mayor Goodway, watch out!

08:02.849 --> 08:04.350
(Clanging)

08:04.417 --> 08:06.786
Whoa, whoa, oh! Oh! Oh!

08:09.121 --> 08:10.857

08:13.259 --> 08:15.528
Now we have two rescues.
Shade?

08:15.595 --> 08:16.829
Already on it.

08:16.896 --> 08:20.566
(Beeping)

08:20.633 --> 08:23.269
Looks like the rocket is about
to head for the bridge!

08:23.336 --> 08:26.038
We're gonna need someone
to get on board and turn it off.

08:26.105 --> 08:28.341
Wild and Chase,
follow that Spin-a-lot

08:28.407 --> 08:30.243

out of your sight.

08:31.844 --> 08:35.181

skills at the top of the bridge.

08:35.248 --> 08:36.582

08:36.649 --> 08:38.784
Mighty Skye,
head for the bridge!

08:38.851 --> 08:41.520
You'll need to give Rory
a super boost.

08:41.587 --> 08:44.490

09:16.122 --> 09:18.624
Now, how do I turn it off?

09:18.691 --> 09:21.193

near the engine.

Uh-oh.
It's losing speed!

If it stops spinning,
it'll crash!

09:33.439 --> 09:35.174
We've gotta get it
spinning again.

09:35.241 --> 09:37.810
Wild, think you can
make a jump that high?

09:37.877 --> 09:40.479
With a mighty push
from Mighty Chase I can!

10:15.648 --> 10:18.417
(Grunting)

10:18.484 --> 10:20.286
Rocket engine turned off.

10:20.353 --> 10:22.088
(Sputtering)

10:22.154 --> 10:23.089
Uh-oh.

10:23.155 --> 10:24.156
(Clucking)

10:25.458 --> 10:27.693
Ryder, the rocket ship
is dropping!

10:27.760 --> 10:29.328
They're going
to need help landing.

10:29.395 --> 10:31.931
Leo, can you catch
a falling rocket?

10:31.998 --> 10:35.267
Sure I can,
and I'm not "lion!"

10:35.334 --> 10:36.402
(Chuckling)

10:36.469 --> 10:38.037
(Rocket whistling)

10:38.104 --> 10:39.038
Lion strength!

10:39.105 --> 10:41.240
(Roaring)

10:42.241 --> 10:43.175
- (Clanging)
- (Grunting)

10:43.242 --> 10:45.044
Roar!

10:46.779 --> 10:48.080
LEO:
We're comin' in hot!

10:48.147 --> 10:49.415
Hang on, Mayor.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.650
Couple more spins
and this ride is over.

10:54.353 --> 10:56.522
Oh, whoa.

10:56.589 --> 10:57.523
Chickaletta?

10:57.590 --> 10:59.859
- That was cool!
- Can we do that?

10:59.925 --> 11:04.597
Maybe let's just go to the space
exhibition gift shop instead.

11:04.663 --> 11:05.965
KIDS:
Yay!

11:07.299 --> 11:11.037
Thanks, Mighty Pups
and Cat Pack for saving us!

11:11.103 --> 11:12.371
You're welcome, Mayor.

11:12.438 --> 11:14.140
Whenever your rocket
goes wrong,

11:14.206 --> 11:15.775
just yelp for help.

11:15.841 --> 11:18.577
You two are really fast.

11:18.644 --> 11:21.213
So, how 'bout
that foot race?

11:21.280 --> 11:22.782
All the way around town?

11:22.848 --> 11:25.451
First one back
to the Lookout wins.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.386
We'll meet ya
at the finish line.

11:27.453 --> 11:30.022
Ready, set, go!

11:31.791 --> 11:33.659
- Woo!
- Woo!

11:33.726 --> 11:35.561
Here they come!

11:35.628 --> 11:37.596
And the winner is--

11:37.663 --> 11:39.965
