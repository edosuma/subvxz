01:19.178 --> 01:19.877
Hey, Louie.

01:19.912 --> 01:21.879
Hey, Jeff.

01:21.914 --> 01:24.982
Hey, how come you hung
      this girlie calendar here?

01:25.016 --> 01:30.288
Don't, don't say girlie calendar
like those girls are bimbos.

01:30.323 --> 01:34.392
Those girls are not bimbos,
they're all career women.

01:34.426 --> 01:39.397
That girl bending over to lace
her boots is a brain surgeon.

01:39.432 --> 01:42.567
Well, I don't care about
            the calendar, Louie,

01:42.601 --> 01:46.237
but why is it covering
       the picture of my mother?

01:46.271 --> 01:48.673
Well, look, to tell you
the truth, uh, Jeff,

01:48.708 --> 01:51.909
that picture of your old lady
give me the willies.

01:51.944 --> 01:54.212
Hey, Louie, what're you trying
         to say about my mother?

01:54.247 --> 01:56.447
What, come on, let's face it,

01:56.481 --> 01:59.350
you must admit
      she's no Lena Horne.

01:59.385 --> 02:02.086
Well, I think
                she's beautiful.

02:02.120 --> 02:04.622
Everyone who knows her
         thinks she's beautiful.

02:04.657 --> 02:08.059
'Cause God gave her
           beauty on the inside.

02:08.092 --> 02:10.829
Good, because he gave her
Swamp Thing on the outside.

02:10.863 --> 02:13.231
Hey, Louie, you say one more
           thing about my mother

02:13.266 --> 02:14.499
and I'm going to deck you.

02:14.533 --> 02:16.234
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

02:16.268 --> 02:17.602
When I see that picture,

02:17.636 --> 02:20.171
I see the most beautiful
             woman in the world.

02:26.678 --> 02:29.213
(shivers)

02:31.050 --> 02:32.249
I think you're
                the best referee

02:32.284 --> 02:33.751
we ever had with the kids.

02:33.785 --> 02:36.454
Now you're so good I'm going
     to buy you a cup of coffee.

02:36.488 --> 02:37.788
Yeah, thanks.

02:37.823 --> 02:39.957
I don't know, I still feel
    I need a little practice

02:39.992 --> 02:42.293
on my footwork, you know?

02:47.399 --> 02:49.066
Work out, Al, work out.

02:54.372 --> 03:00.912
Alex, take a tip from
            your old friend Jim.

03:00.946 --> 03:05.883
Sprinkle a little baby
          powder in your shorts.

03:08.020 --> 03:11.456
And it'll clear
                  that right up.

03:11.490 --> 03:15.393
No, no, no, Jim, I was, I was
refereeing down at Tony's gym.

03:15.427 --> 03:17.161
Well, that's
               good for it, too,

03:17.196 --> 03:19.464
but if you really want
         to clear it up, just...

03:21.801 --> 03:23.268
Thanks, Jim.

03:23.302 --> 03:24.669
A lot.

03:24.703 --> 03:27.372
Oh, good. Don't any
       of you guys leave.

03:27.406 --> 03:28.873
ALEX: Huh?
   My son Jason's coming here

03:28.908 --> 03:30.575
with a tape you're going
        to want to hear.

03:30.609 --> 03:32.644
He had his first music recital
             today.

03:32.678 --> 03:34.012
Oh, yeah?
    How'd it go?

03:34.046 --> 03:35.479
Oh, well,
             I don't know.

03:35.514 --> 03:37.849
I had to work at the art
   gallery, so I couldn't go.

03:37.883 --> 03:39.550
That's why he's coming here.

03:39.585 --> 03:41.218
But you're in for a treat.

03:41.253 --> 03:43.922
You're going to hear how his
  oboe lessons have paid off.

03:43.956 --> 03:46.824
I think it's great that you're
   giving him those lessons.

03:46.858 --> 03:47.792
Yeah.

03:47.827 --> 03:49.594
Every boy should know

03:49.629 --> 03:53.064
how to hop on
a moving freight train.

03:53.099 --> 03:56.734
Jim, I think she said oboe
      lessons, not hobo lessons.

03:59.738 --> 04:01.572
Hold on. Don't
                 worry about it.

04:04.477 --> 04:06.377
TONY: Oboe, huh?
                 ELAINE: Uh-huh.

04:06.412 --> 04:08.779
I mean, that's an interesting
         choice of an instrument

04:08.814 --> 04:10.448
to force your kid to play.

04:10.482 --> 04:12.817
I didn't force him to play it.

04:12.851 --> 04:14.618
What's wrong with the oboe?

04:14.653 --> 04:16.954
It's a sissy instrument.

04:16.988 --> 04:19.890
No, no, wait, wait, wait,
      I played the violin

04:19.925 --> 04:24.262
when I was a kid, and nobody
     thought I was a sissy,

04:24.296 --> 04:27.665
because I followed
        one simple rule.

04:27.699 --> 04:32.070
For every hour that I practiced,
    I committed an atrocity.

04:34.073 --> 04:36.007
Stay away from my kid, Louie.

04:39.144 --> 04:41.913
Listen, I'm not making
      my kid into a sissy.

04:41.947 --> 04:44.515
I mean, you know, Jason's
 learning to play the oboe now,

04:44.549 --> 04:46.851
but I wouldn't object if he came
    to me tomorrow and said,

04:46.886 --> 04:49.154
"Mom, I don't want
   to play the oboe anymore.

04:49.188 --> 04:50.421
I'd rather spend my time..."

04:50.456 --> 04:52.156
Ballet dancing.

04:54.326 --> 04:55.826
Playing baseball

04:55.861 --> 04:59.330
or logging or smelting pig
      iron or anything he wants.

04:59.364 --> 05:02.566
Besides, if Jason didn't like
the oboe, he'd tell me about it.

05:02.601 --> 05:03.701
Ah.

05:03.736 --> 05:05.470
(thudding)

05:07.707 --> 05:10.007
Jason?

05:10.041 --> 05:11.242
Jason!

05:11.277 --> 05:12.577
That's a very expensive
          instrument.

05:12.611 --> 05:14.779
It's a stupid instrument.

05:14.813 --> 05:17.448
Why do you say that?

05:17.482 --> 05:18.883
I know.

05:18.918 --> 05:20.518
It's because the other kids
           tease you

05:20.552 --> 05:22.120
about being a sissy, huh?

05:22.154 --> 05:23.788
No, th-they tease me

05:23.822 --> 05:26.090
because I don't play it
      beautifully enough.

05:26.125 --> 05:28.559
The neighborhood has changed.

05:28.593 --> 05:30.861
They're just jealous.

05:30.896 --> 05:32.897
Now come on, I want
       to hear your tape.

05:32.931 --> 05:36.233
(oboe playing
 "Peter and the Wolf" off-key)

05:36.268 --> 05:39.970
Oh, Jason.

05:40.005 --> 05:41.339
Aw...

05:43.975 --> 05:46.945
Oh, it's so beautiful,
I could cry.

05:46.979 --> 05:49.113
Yeah, you and the composer.

05:49.147 --> 05:51.415
"Peter and the Wolf."

05:51.450 --> 05:52.450
Yeah.
                         Mm-hmm.

05:52.485 --> 05:54.585
I haven't heard that
           for weeks.

05:54.619 --> 05:56.987
Mom, I got to go.

05:57.022 --> 05:58.422
My ride is waiting.

05:58.457 --> 06:00.791
Oh, all right, well, I'll listen
to the whole thing later.

06:00.826 --> 06:02.092
(tape recorder clicks off)
    Okay.

06:04.096 --> 06:06.564
Hey, hey, Tony,
   how's your boxing coming?

06:06.598 --> 06:09.167
Oh, well, uh, I'm not taking
          too many bouts lately.

06:09.201 --> 06:10.902
You know, I'm coaching
            kids instead, Jason.

06:10.936 --> 06:12.069
Wow!

06:12.104 --> 06:14.806
Hey, do they get beat up
     as bad as you used to?

06:14.840 --> 06:17.942
No, no. They wear headgear and
 big gloves and all, you know.

06:17.977 --> 06:19.143
It's fun.

06:19.177 --> 06:20.778
Why, why don't you
      come down sometimes?

06:20.812 --> 06:21.679
And box?

06:21.713 --> 06:23.447
Absolutely not.

06:23.482 --> 06:24.281
Why not?

06:24.315 --> 06:26.017
I think she has her heart set

06:26.051 --> 06:28.285
on logging or smelting pig iron.

06:28.320 --> 06:30.655
Well, I-I don't want
            to box.

06:30.689 --> 06:32.189
I just want to watch.
                        Hey.

06:32.224 --> 06:33.891
Oh, you want to watch.

06:33.925 --> 06:36.594
Oh, okay, that's all right.

06:36.629 --> 06:37.962
Come on, honey,

06:37.996 --> 06:39.730
you're going to be late
        for your movie.

06:39.765 --> 06:41.632
Yeah, we're going to
see <i>Star Wars</i> again.

06:41.666 --> 06:43.601
What's your favorite part?

06:43.635 --> 06:45.035
That scene in the bar.

06:45.070 --> 06:48.405
Oh, you mean, the one with all
the weird-looking aliens in it?

06:48.440 --> 06:50.508
You like that kind of stuff?
             Yeah.

06:53.546 --> 06:55.647
Here, show this to your friends.

06:55.681 --> 06:57.048
They'll love it.

07:03.555 --> 07:05.190
All right.

07:05.224 --> 07:08.226
Don't swallow this, Matty.

07:08.260 --> 07:10.028
Okay, you got it?

07:10.062 --> 07:11.295
All right, now, mean.

07:11.330 --> 07:13.464
(growls)

07:13.499 --> 07:15.065
Okay, ooh, this...

07:15.100 --> 07:17.068
I bet you're going to be good,
            I hope.

07:20.338 --> 07:21.839
(bell clangs)

07:21.873 --> 07:23.808
All right now,
                 box around now.

07:23.843 --> 07:24.809
All right, stick
                  it out, Matty.

07:24.843 --> 07:26.177
Use the left.

07:26.211 --> 07:27.812
Ooh, all right,
              Carlos, good shot.

07:27.846 --> 07:29.379
Ooh, easy baby now...
JASON:
Hey, Tony.

07:29.414 --> 07:30.548
Hey, Elaine. Hi, Jason.
                        Hi.

07:30.582 --> 07:32.250
I'll be with you
                    in a second.
                 Okay.

07:32.284 --> 07:33.818
Move now, move.

07:33.852 --> 07:35.152
Keep moving.

07:35.187 --> 07:36.654
Move to your left.

07:36.689 --> 07:37.889
Matty's usually good
for about two minutes

07:37.923 --> 07:39.590
before I have
to stop the fight.

07:39.625 --> 07:41.926
Keep going, baby.
     Oh, you let them fight
  until they hurt each other?

07:41.960 --> 07:44.495
Oh, no, no. That's
when his trunks usually
start falling down.

07:44.529 --> 07:46.497
(laughing):
                             Oh!
Okay, come on now.

07:46.531 --> 07:48.031
Keep moving
                  there, Carlos.

07:48.066 --> 07:50.067
Oh, Tony, aren't
    they too young for this?
Stop hitting gloves.

07:50.101 --> 07:52.937
Nah, look at 'em, Elaine.
They're not hurting each other.

07:52.972 --> 07:54.305
I mean, gee, they're learning
         sportsmanship,

07:54.339 --> 07:55.573
hand-eye coordination.

07:55.607 --> 07:58.843
And boxing, it's
fantastic for kids.

07:58.877 --> 08:00.878
Uh-oh, uh-oh, wait, uh-oh.

08:02.581 --> 08:03.981
(bell clangs)

08:04.016 --> 08:05.382
Hold it. Hold it. Hold it.

08:05.417 --> 08:08.519
Well, I'm sorry,
               Matty, I'm sorry.

08:08.553 --> 08:10.888
All right, buddy.
I love this kid.

08:10.922 --> 08:13.291
Keep moving, guys,
         finish strong.

08:13.325 --> 08:15.359
Hey, Tony, this looks
like a lot of fun.

08:15.394 --> 08:16.527
Can I try it?

08:16.561 --> 08:17.928
Uh, no, Jason, you can't.

08:17.962 --> 08:19.663
Why not?

08:19.697 --> 08:21.865
Well, well, because your
     mother doesn't want you to.

08:21.900 --> 08:24.535
All right, guys,
move in there now. Move in.

08:24.570 --> 08:26.137
Finish strong.
         Finish strong.

08:26.171 --> 08:27.738
All right, time.

08:27.773 --> 08:28.473
Time. Time.

08:28.507 --> 08:29.841
Way to go, guys.

08:29.875 --> 08:31.175
All right, Carlos,
great workout.

08:31.209 --> 08:32.243
You're looking good, babe.

08:32.277 --> 08:33.143
You, too.

08:33.178 --> 08:34.745
Get a shower.
            Get out of here.

08:34.779 --> 08:37.815
Hey, Coach, who am I
going to spar with?

08:37.850 --> 08:39.183
Well, where's Thompson?

08:39.217 --> 08:40.551
He went home.

08:40.585 --> 08:42.419
Ah, well, uh... well, gee,
            there's nobody left.

08:42.453 --> 08:44.488
I guess you can be first
         next week though, okay?

08:44.523 --> 08:46.324
What about him?

08:49.094 --> 08:52.663
Uh, Elaine, let me have a word
    with you a second here.

08:52.698 --> 08:55.499
You know, Jason wants to box,

08:55.534 --> 08:58.102
and this is a perfect
opportunity for him

08:58.137 --> 09:00.404
because Gregory over there
        is perfect for your son.

09:00.438 --> 09:02.439
What do you mean by that?

09:02.474 --> 09:03.941
Gregory is a wimp.

09:03.976 --> 09:06.443
Are you saying that
                 Jason's a wimp?

09:06.478 --> 09:08.779
No, no, not a wimp.

09:08.814 --> 09:09.780
A sissy?

09:09.814 --> 09:10.715
No, no!

09:10.749 --> 09:11.916
A weakling.

09:11.950 --> 09:13.951
That's all
I'm trying to say.
                           Yeah?

09:13.985 --> 09:16.854
Well, I'll have you know
        he's extremely athletic.

09:16.889 --> 09:18.456
I know.
Oh, Mom, can't I box?

09:18.490 --> 09:19.924
Please, Mom, please,
let me box.

09:19.958 --> 09:22.126
What's the matter?

09:22.160 --> 09:23.460
Your mommy won't
let you fight?

09:25.530 --> 09:27.064
Let him go one round.

09:27.099 --> 09:29.033
I promise, I promise,
  nothing will happen to him.

09:29.067 --> 09:30.300
I promise, Elaine.

09:30.335 --> 09:31.502
Please, Mom.

09:31.537 --> 09:32.970
(imitating Jason):
Please, Mom.

09:33.004 --> 09:35.540
Oh.

09:35.574 --> 09:37.208
All right, if you
                 really want to.

09:37.242 --> 09:38.409
All right!
Great!

09:38.443 --> 09:40.077
Come on, get some gloves
          on you. Come on.

09:40.112 --> 09:41.412
Tony, why did you...?

09:41.446 --> 09:42.780
(Tony humming tune)

09:42.815 --> 09:44.315
Elaine, don't worry
                  about a thing.

09:44.349 --> 09:45.616
You're doing
                the right thing.
Yeah?

09:45.650 --> 09:46.784
Wait a minute,
                       let me...
You sure?

09:46.819 --> 09:48.686
Oh, yeah, this is
                 good for Jason.

09:48.721 --> 09:50.388
He's a regular kid.

09:50.422 --> 09:52.489
Let me tell ya, this
     might even improve his wind

09:52.523 --> 09:54.325
for them difficult
                  oboe passages.

09:54.360 --> 09:55.893
Here you go.

09:55.928 --> 09:57.128
I'm ready, Coach.

09:59.030 --> 10:00.631
(clearing throat)

10:00.665 --> 10:02.833
Hi, what's your name?

10:02.868 --> 10:04.735
"Bulldog" Gregory.

10:04.770 --> 10:06.504
What's his?

10:06.538 --> 10:10.408
Oh, that's my son Jason...
      "The Butcher" Nardo.

10:11.910 --> 10:13.911
Come on, guys,
                      in you go.

10:13.946 --> 10:15.579
See? And you thought

10:15.614 --> 10:17.915
I was an overprotective
      mother, didn't you?

10:17.950 --> 10:19.650
Well, I'm not.

10:19.685 --> 10:21.485
I'm a blithering pea brain.

10:21.520 --> 10:22.820
Oh, Elaine.

10:22.854 --> 10:24.321
All right, guys...
    Now you listen, Jason--

10:24.356 --> 10:26.757
you saw those other guys, so
 just use your instincts, okay?

10:26.791 --> 10:27.891
You'll be fine.

10:27.926 --> 10:30.828
Now, look, I want a clean fight,
           all right?

10:30.863 --> 10:32.763
I don't want
  no hitting behind the head.

10:32.798 --> 10:34.632
And when I say
                 "box," you box.

10:34.666 --> 10:36.601
But when I say "break,"
           you break, all right?

10:36.635 --> 10:38.636
What's he doing?

10:41.005 --> 10:42.873
Not now. He's new.

10:46.544 --> 10:49.013
All right, here you go.

10:49.047 --> 10:51.182
Okay, all right,
      wait a minute here.

10:52.350 --> 10:54.117
Okay, buddy, here we go.
              ELAINE: All right.

10:54.152 --> 10:55.119
TONY: All right now.

10:55.154 --> 10:56.921
Be careful.

10:56.955 --> 10:58.155
Here we go.
                      You ready?

10:58.190 --> 11:00.358
(bell clangs)
                      All right,
                     box around.

11:00.392 --> 11:01.759
All right, Jason,
                  nice and easy.

11:01.793 --> 11:04.228
First time in there,
              you know, you want
                   to look good.

11:04.263 --> 11:06.097
ELAINE:
      See, you look at him move.

11:06.131 --> 11:07.932
That's it, Greg,
                 move in on him.
                 Ooh, good shot!

11:07.966 --> 11:09.233
ELAINE:
                       Ooh, hey!

11:09.267 --> 11:10.400
What the...?
    Ooh, hey!

11:10.435 --> 11:12.536
TONY:
                     Hey, Jason!
                 Hold it, Jason!

11:12.570 --> 11:15.206
Ja-Ja-Jason!

11:15.240 --> 11:16.373
What's the matter with you?

11:16.408 --> 11:17.541
You don't hit anybody
when he's down.

11:17.576 --> 11:19.577
Get up! I'm not through
       with you! Get up!

11:21.446 --> 11:23.814
Oh, hold it, hold it.
The fight's over.

11:23.848 --> 11:24.882
Jason wins.

11:24.916 --> 11:25.849
Come on, get up.

11:25.884 --> 11:28.419
My God, shake hands.

11:28.453 --> 11:29.987
Whew!
Hey, now, look, you.

11:30.021 --> 11:32.123
Let me get you out
         of this thing.

11:32.157 --> 11:33.123
Go hit the showers.

11:33.157 --> 11:34.691
I've only boxed
for ten seconds.

11:34.726 --> 11:36.460
I don't need a shower.

11:36.494 --> 11:38.129
You needed a shower
       when you got here.

11:38.163 --> 11:39.330
Get out of here.
      Get this thing off.

11:39.364 --> 11:40.330
Are you all right?

11:40.365 --> 11:41.332
Man!

11:41.366 --> 11:42.165
Did you see me?

11:42.200 --> 11:43.701
I mean, I punished him.

11:43.736 --> 11:44.802
Yeah, you did.

11:44.836 --> 11:48.038
I killed him!
     I got him in the gut!

11:48.073 --> 11:49.340
I made him go, "Ugh!"

11:49.374 --> 11:52.142
All right now, okay,
         all right, now stop it.

11:52.177 --> 11:53.644
Stop it!

11:53.678 --> 11:55.412
I don't like this side of you.

11:55.447 --> 11:57.815
Hey, you've got a pretty
talented kid here, Elaine.

11:57.849 --> 11:58.949
Yeah, talented?

11:58.983 --> 12:00.318
Yeah, quick hands,
quick feet.

12:00.352 --> 12:01.852
He could be
a terrific boxer.

12:01.887 --> 12:04.455
Oh, if he ever boxed
          again, which he's not.

12:04.490 --> 12:05.890
That's not fair!

12:05.924 --> 12:09.093
How come I always got to do
  the stuff you want me to do,

12:09.127 --> 12:11.929
but I never get to do the stuff
         I want to do?!

12:11.963 --> 12:13.197
Because in this case,

12:13.232 --> 12:15.166
what you want to do
     is appalling and disgusting

12:15.200 --> 12:17.701
and dangerous to you
       and extremely distasteful
                 to your mother.

12:17.735 --> 12:21.071
You said the same thing
         about Pac-Man.

12:22.808 --> 12:25.442
I wish Dad was here.

12:25.477 --> 12:27.411
He'd let me box.

12:28.513 --> 12:30.148
Jason...

12:30.182 --> 12:31.715
Jason...

12:33.318 --> 12:36.320
Tony, don't look at me like that
  because he's not gonna box.

12:36.354 --> 12:37.455
Come on, Elaine.

12:37.489 --> 12:38.655
He's not gonna box!

12:38.690 --> 12:40.491
Jason!

12:46.031 --> 12:49.099
ELAINE:
    <i>Oh, Alex, Alex, he's been</i>
    <i>miserable for three days.</i>

12:49.134 --> 12:50.834
ALEX:
             <i>Mm-hmm.</i>

12:50.869 --> 12:52.937
I mean, I'm trying
        to raise my son

12:52.971 --> 12:54.371
to be a normal,
          healthy boy,

12:54.406 --> 12:56.674
and maybe sometimes I need
     a man's point of view.

12:56.708 --> 12:59.110
I think you should let him box.

12:59.144 --> 13:00.311
Maybe not yours.

13:00.345 --> 13:02.079
Oh.

13:02.113 --> 13:03.647
Oh, do you
                really think so?

13:03.682 --> 13:04.915
You don't care what I think.

13:04.949 --> 13:06.250
No, I do, I do.

13:06.285 --> 13:08.219
I was just hoping that maybe
      you'd agree with me.

13:08.253 --> 13:09.587
Oh.
See, Alex,
I'm afraid

13:09.621 --> 13:11.589
that maybe Jason's missing out
         on something,

13:11.623 --> 13:13.324
being raised by a single mother.

13:13.358 --> 13:17.294
If you really think I should
 let him box, then convince me.

13:17.329 --> 13:18.295
Uh, Alex...

13:20.532 --> 13:23.166
Uh, may I?

13:23.201 --> 13:28.673
Uh, I think I have a few
pertinent words

13:28.707 --> 13:30.640
to say on this subject.

13:35.814 --> 13:43.287
The ability of two men
       to put on gloves,

13:43.321 --> 13:45.856
stand toe-to-toe

13:45.890 --> 13:48.893
in the spirit of sportsmanship

13:48.927 --> 13:54.865
and pummel each other
       into insensibility

13:54.899 --> 13:59.837
is what separates us
       from the animals.

14:12.951 --> 14:14.218
(head thuds on bench)

14:21.526 --> 14:22.926
Elaine, come here,
           come here.

14:22.961 --> 14:24.761
Look, look, look,
       just listen to me.

14:24.796 --> 14:26.563
We're not talking about
      prizefighting here.

14:26.597 --> 14:28.532
We're talking about kids boxing

14:28.566 --> 14:30.467
under, under very safe
conditions.

14:30.501 --> 14:32.736
I mean, with headgear
and big soft gloves.
           Yeah, I know, I know.

14:32.770 --> 14:34.204
I just don't want him
                    to get hurt.

14:34.239 --> 14:35.539
Elaine,
would you trust me?

14:35.573 --> 14:37.541
I've been refereeing these
     little ten-year-olds,

14:37.576 --> 14:40.611
and where they hit me, if they
   could do any harm at all,

14:40.645 --> 14:43.513
you wouldn't be hearing me now
     unless you were a dog.

14:45.717 --> 14:47.718
Oh, he really wants
               to do this, Alex.

14:47.752 --> 14:48.885
Then let him do it.

14:48.920 --> 14:50.854
Come on.
Competitive sports
are good for a kid.

14:50.888 --> 14:52.089
They teach him discipline.

14:52.124 --> 14:53.724
They teach him,
they teach him courage.

14:53.759 --> 14:55.059
They teach him determination,
self-respect.

14:55.093 --> 14:57.394
I was raised
by my mother.

14:57.429 --> 14:59.630
She didn't want me to do
competitive sports.

14:59.664 --> 15:00.631
No?

15:00.665 --> 15:02.299
No, but she
finally gave in.

15:02.333 --> 15:05.302
Yeah, I can remember
making that school team,

15:05.337 --> 15:08.172
getting into my first game,
catching that ball

15:08.206 --> 15:11.374
and tucking it under my arm
and racing down the field.

15:11.409 --> 15:13.610
I mean, it's moments
like that you don't forget.

15:13.645 --> 15:15.880
Did you score a touchdown?

15:15.914 --> 15:18.382
Well, no, actually, we were
playing soccer at the time.

15:18.417 --> 15:20.651
We-- not allowed to use
your hands in soccer,

15:20.685 --> 15:22.219
so it cost us a penalty kick.

15:22.254 --> 15:23.487
And, uh, well, after the game,

15:23.521 --> 15:25.255
the kids on the team
took off my pants

15:25.290 --> 15:26.924
and threw them out
of the bus window,

15:26.958 --> 15:27.924
but that didn't matter, no.

15:27.959 --> 15:29.893
I mean, I felt,
I felt accepted.

15:29.927 --> 15:31.262
Yeah?

15:31.296 --> 15:34.899
If Jason were your son, Alex,
          would you let him box?

15:34.933 --> 15:36.467
I would.

15:36.501 --> 15:40.337
Okay, you've convinced me.
          I'm gonna let him box.
Good.

15:40.372 --> 15:42.206
You're not gonna regret it,
I'm telling you.

15:42.240 --> 15:43.841
You're not gonna
regret it.

15:43.875 --> 15:45.342
Okay.

15:45.377 --> 15:46.643
Elaine...
                       Oh, Tony!

15:46.678 --> 15:47.912
Don't interrupt me.

15:47.946 --> 15:49.012
I've been thinking
about this

15:49.047 --> 15:50.447
for the past three days,

15:50.481 --> 15:53.650
and I've gone over and over
every argument to convince you,

15:53.684 --> 15:56.553
and, well, I think
you should let Jason box

15:56.588 --> 15:59.456
because... well,
you should!

15:59.490 --> 16:02.626
Okay, Tony.

16:06.764 --> 16:09.933
I should have
been a lawyer.

16:09.968 --> 16:11.568
Yeah, yeah.

16:15.507 --> 16:17.675
(bell clangs)

16:19.644 --> 16:22.479
(applause)

16:22.513 --> 16:24.014
Louie, what are you
                doing here?

16:24.048 --> 16:26.550
I want to make sure
nobody welshes on their bets.

16:26.585 --> 16:28.218
You're betting
                on these fights?

16:28.253 --> 16:29.686
They're just children.

16:29.721 --> 16:31.822
How could you bet
                 on little kids?

16:31.856 --> 16:35.492
I made little bets.

16:35.526 --> 16:38.095
What kind of sick person
           would take your bets?

16:38.129 --> 16:41.398
It was only two dollars.

16:41.433 --> 16:42.866
He's my son.

16:42.900 --> 16:46.503
HILLARY:
     I see your son's matched up
                 against my son.

16:46.538 --> 16:47.671
Good luck.

16:47.706 --> 16:49.639
Well, you seem awfully calm.

16:49.674 --> 16:52.876
To be honest, I'm not that
 thrilled about my son boxing,

16:52.911 --> 16:55.179
but beats hanging
      around a pool hall.

16:55.213 --> 16:57.314
Your son hangs
       around pool halls?

16:57.348 --> 16:59.449
No, I do.

17:01.619 --> 17:03.988
(bell clanging)

17:04.021 --> 17:05.189
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,

17:05.223 --> 17:07.590
before the next bout,
    I have an announcement.

17:07.625 --> 17:11.628
Uh, we are honored to have at
 ringside a very special guest.

17:11.663 --> 17:15.765
He is the champion of last
   year's 68-pound division,

17:15.800 --> 17:18.101
none other than Johnny Castillo!

17:18.136 --> 17:20.738
(audience cheering,
         bell clanging)

17:20.771 --> 17:22.138
Hey!

17:22.173 --> 17:23.440
Hey, John,
    all right!

17:25.977 --> 17:29.146
Nice to see you, bud.

17:31.950 --> 17:33.384
(bell clanging)

17:33.418 --> 17:39.423
The next bout, we have in this
 corner wearing the blue trunks

17:39.458 --> 17:42.593
and weighing 65 pounds--
          Jason Nardo!

17:42.627 --> 17:44.127
(audience cheering,
         bell clanging)

17:44.162 --> 17:46.129
(audience whistling)

17:46.164 --> 17:51.301
And in this corner weighing in
          at 66 pounds

17:51.335 --> 17:54.171
and wearing red trunks--
         Benny Jamison!

17:54.206 --> 17:56.506
(cheers, whistles, applause)

17:58.343 --> 18:00.244
Okay, come on.
      You know the rules.

18:00.278 --> 18:03.614
No low blows, no head butts
      and no name-calling.

18:03.648 --> 18:04.982
You understand?

18:05.016 --> 18:06.984
I want a clean fight. Shake
   hands. Come out fighting.

18:07.018 --> 18:10.821
All right, Jas,
                now you remember
              what I taught you.

18:10.855 --> 18:12.957
Okay, now keep moving,
         sticking out that left.

18:12.991 --> 18:14.892
Keep your guard up.
                Don't get tired.

18:14.926 --> 18:16.593
Save your best
            for the third round.

18:16.628 --> 18:17.961
Go in there
                   and nail him!

18:17.996 --> 18:19.930
Go ahead, baby,
       get him, baby, go!

18:19.964 --> 18:21.665
(Elaine gasps)

18:21.699 --> 18:23.233
TONY:
Jas? Jason!
              Oh, no!

18:23.268 --> 18:25.469
ELAINE:
                   Jason! Jason!

18:25.503 --> 18:27.938
Oh, Jas!
        (Jason sobbing)

18:27.973 --> 18:30.741
I think my nose is broken.

18:30.775 --> 18:33.177
I think he said
his nose is broken.

18:33.211 --> 18:34.545
Oh, no, baby,
               you're all right.

18:34.579 --> 18:35.912
It's not broken,
                 it's just sore.

18:35.947 --> 18:37.281
Ow!

18:37.315 --> 18:39.316
It's broken.

18:39.350 --> 18:40.584
Oh, no!

18:40.619 --> 18:41.651
Okay.

18:41.686 --> 18:44.488
Oh, can I have
        my purse, please? Oh...

18:44.523 --> 18:45.622
I am so sorry.

18:45.656 --> 18:47.190
I hope you don't blame
        my son for this.

18:47.225 --> 18:49.526
Oh, no. I, I couldn't blame him
       for anything done

18:49.560 --> 18:51.328
in the spirit
      of competition, no.

18:51.362 --> 18:55.098
I blame him
        and I blame him!

18:55.133 --> 18:56.533
Hey, Nardo,
                      I'm sorry.

18:56.567 --> 18:58.301
Don't worry
                       about it.

18:58.336 --> 19:00.504
You can pay me
                       tomorrow.

19:00.538 --> 19:01.638
Elaine...

19:01.672 --> 19:03.541
Elaine, I'm gonna go.
           I'm going.

19:03.575 --> 19:05.242
Wait a minute,
wait a minute, Tony, Elaine!

19:05.277 --> 19:08.978
Uh... uh, here,
    you're the ref, Johnny.

19:30.602 --> 19:31.968
Look, Elaine, I...

19:32.003 --> 19:33.971
Tony, please,
                  let's not have
                   another scene

19:34.005 --> 19:36.340
like we had at
             the emergency room.

19:36.374 --> 19:39.209
At least she's
                       calm now.

19:39.243 --> 19:42.079
I just wanted
                    to tell her:

19:42.113 --> 19:43.380
Don't worry
             about Jason's nose.

19:43.414 --> 19:45.015
My nose was
               broken six times.

19:45.049 --> 19:47.184
Look how good
                      it healed.

19:51.822 --> 19:53.323
(sobs quietly)

19:53.358 --> 19:55.192
What'd I say?

19:55.227 --> 19:57.261
Tony, Tony,
                 it's all right,
                 it's all right.

19:57.295 --> 19:58.528
She's in a mood.

19:58.563 --> 20:00.864
Nothing you can say
         can make it any better.

20:00.898 --> 20:02.366
Anyway, you're
                       home now.

20:02.400 --> 20:08.105
Oh, okay. Uh,
              hey, look, Elaine,
               I'm really sorry.

20:08.139 --> 20:10.640
I'm really, really sorry,
           and I don't blame you

20:10.674 --> 20:13.811
for blaming me for this.

20:13.845 --> 20:15.613
I don't blame you, Tony.

20:15.647 --> 20:18.682
It's just
bad luck, I guess.

20:18.716 --> 20:20.016
You spoke!

20:20.051 --> 20:22.119
She spoke!

20:22.153 --> 20:23.620
All right,
                 thanks, Elaine.

20:23.654 --> 20:25.255
Good night, Al.
                   Night, Jason.

20:25.289 --> 20:27.758
Good night, Tony.

20:29.994 --> 20:31.294
(sighs)

20:31.329 --> 20:34.331
You know, I'm really glad
           to hear you say that.

20:34.366 --> 20:37.033
I was afraid you
             weren't gonna speak

20:37.068 --> 20:38.902
to either of us again.

20:42.106 --> 20:44.207
Elaine? Oh, come on!

20:44.242 --> 20:47.278
Now why are you more mad at me
     than you were at Tony?

20:47.312 --> 20:50.514
'Cause I don't rely on Tony's
 opinion like I rely on yours,

20:50.548 --> 20:51.781
and you know that.

20:51.816 --> 20:53.650
You said to let him box,

20:53.684 --> 20:55.719
so I let him box,
    and look what happened.

20:55.753 --> 20:58.388
I'm really sorry.

21:00.124 --> 21:02.026
Oh, it's not your fault.

21:02.060 --> 21:03.527
(sighs)
It's my fault.

21:03.561 --> 21:05.696
I'm the one
who let him box.

21:06.798 --> 21:09.466
Oh...

21:09.501 --> 21:11.301
But that's it!

21:11.336 --> 21:15.705
Oh! Oh, I'm gonna be so careful
with this kid from now on.

21:15.739 --> 21:17.907
If you thought I was an
overprotective mother before,

21:17.942 --> 21:20.477
ho-ho-ho, you ain't
seen nothing yet.

21:20.511 --> 21:21.878
He isn't gonna go
anywhere,

21:21.913 --> 21:23.280
he isn't gonna do
anything,

21:23.314 --> 21:25.983
and all he's gonna eat
is strained food.

21:26.017 --> 21:28.318
Oh, come on, will you, Elaine?

21:28.353 --> 21:29.787
No, I mean it, Alex.

21:29.821 --> 21:31.388
I mean it.

21:31.422 --> 21:33.323
And he's not gonna
ride his bicycle.

21:33.358 --> 21:35.526
And he's definitely
not gonna climb trees.

21:35.560 --> 21:37.860
And no way is he gonna
play any sports.

21:37.895 --> 21:39.463
Oh, come on.
He isn't gonna do anything

21:39.497 --> 21:41.865
there's the remotest possibility
that he could hurt himself.

21:41.899 --> 21:44.301
Oh, yeah? The day will come
     when he has to shave.

21:44.335 --> 21:46.303
Who says?

21:46.337 --> 21:48.338
Oh, some men look better
in beards.

21:48.373 --> 21:50.807
Not a pretty picture:

21:50.841 --> 21:53.910
a 44-year-old man sitting
    in a room full of hair,

21:53.945 --> 21:55.813
playing an oboe.

21:57.148 --> 21:58.214
Come on, Elaine,

21:58.248 --> 22:00.017
you know you're
              not gonna do that.

22:00.051 --> 22:01.951
I know, I know.

22:01.986 --> 22:04.354
There are so many tough
decisions to make,

22:04.388 --> 22:06.356
and I don't know
if I can make them all.

22:06.390 --> 22:09.092
You'll make them.

22:09.127 --> 22:11.661
Making tough decisions is part
       of raising a kid.

22:13.430 --> 22:15.398
So you make some mistakes
         along the way,

22:15.433 --> 22:18.335
but you're an intelligent woman,
  and you're a caring person,

22:18.370 --> 22:19.569
and you're a loving mother.

22:19.604 --> 22:21.905
I think Jason's
               lucky to have <i>you</i>

22:21.940 --> 22:24.207
as the one who's gonna make
        those decisions for him.

22:24.241 --> 22:26.342
Thanks, Alex.

22:26.377 --> 22:28.044
You're welcome.

22:28.078 --> 22:30.080
You know,
the funny thing is

22:30.114 --> 22:34.618
that even after all
he's been through,

22:34.652 --> 22:37.086
losing the fight
and breaking his nose

22:37.121 --> 22:40.390
and-and the pain and trauma
of the emergency room,

22:40.425 --> 22:42.725
I bet that right now
he's wondering

22:42.760 --> 22:46.663
when he can box again.
(chuckles)

22:46.697 --> 22:48.498
You gotta be kidding.

22:50.300 --> 22:51.702
(laughs)

22:53.137 --> 22:54.604
(scoffs)

23:00.612 --> 23:04.281
(theme song playing)

23:25.136 --> 23:26.637
WOMAN:
    <i>Good night, Mr. Walters!</i>

23:26.671 --> 23:27.971
