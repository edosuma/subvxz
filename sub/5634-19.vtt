00:01.752 --> 00:08.342
<i>It seems today that all you see</i>
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

00:08.425 --> 00:12.012
<i>But where are those</i>
<i>Good old-fashioned values</i>

00:12.095 --> 00:15.015
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

00:15.098 --> 00:18.393
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

00:18.477 --> 00:21.522
<i>Lucky there's a man who</i>
<i>Positively can do</i>

00:21.605 --> 00:23.232
<i>All the things that make us</i>

00:23.315 --> 00:24.816
<i>Laugh and cry!</i>

00:24.900 --> 00:30.239
<i>He's a family guy!</i>

00:36.453 --> 00:40.165
Well, Chris, looks like another day
of nobody joining us for lunch.

00:40.249 --> 00:44.044
Yeah, we never should've let
that blind girl touch our faces.

00:45.546 --> 00:48.006
<i>Attention, students.</i>
<i>This is Principal Shepherd</i>

00:48.090 --> 00:50.050
<i>with the lunchtime announcements.</i>

00:50.133 --> 00:52.052
<i>And as a special treat,</i>
<i>I thought I'd deliver them</i>

00:52.135 --> 00:55.389
<i>in the rapping style you kids</i>
<i>are so enthused about.</i>

00:55.472 --> 00:58.016
<i>Later today you're gonna</i>
<i>Have a big thrill</i>

00:58.100 --> 01:00.602
<i>'Cause shortly after lunch</i>
<i>There'll be a fire drill</i>

01:00.686 --> 01:02.896
<i>And when you go out</i>
<i>To wait for the bus</i>

01:02.980 --> 01:05.482
<i>Mm, go in orderly fashion</i>
<i>Or your hair will get mussed</i>

01:05.566 --> 01:08.068
- You suck.
<i>- No, you suck.</i>

01:08.151 --> 01:10.279
<i>I can't hear you, I just presume</i>

01:10.362 --> 01:11.613
<i>somebody must have yelled "You suck."</i>

01:13.490 --> 01:16.660
<i>Don't forget it's time to vote</i>
<i>for homecoming king and queen.</i>

01:16.743 --> 01:20.247
<i>Nominations are due</i>
<i>by 3:00 p.m. today. Peace out.</i>

01:20.330 --> 01:23.292
<i>No, you're a douche bag.</i>

01:23.375 --> 01:26.920
Wow. Can you imagine if one
of us was homecoming king?

01:27.004 --> 01:29.131
Then people would want
to sit with us at lunch.

01:29.214 --> 01:32.134
Yeah, you should run. I'll nominate you.

01:32.217 --> 01:34.428
You know what? I'll do it.

01:34.511 --> 01:36.263
Maybe I'll surprise everyone,

01:36.346 --> 01:38.098
like when you find out
a buttoned-up librarian

01:38.182 --> 01:40.434
is actually super sexy.

01:40.517 --> 01:42.227
Excuse me, ma'am?

01:46.982 --> 01:48.108
<i>Hot blooded...</i>

01:48.192 --> 01:49.943
Yes?

01:50.027 --> 01:52.779
There's a dead homeless man
blocking the card catalog.

01:57.201 --> 02:01.121
Well, there goes Jerome,
loading the urinal up with ice.

02:01.205 --> 02:04.166
Gonna go play me my melting game.

02:04.249 --> 02:06.668
Man, I'm starting to get drunk.
Is it even noon yet?

02:06.752 --> 02:08.754
- Uh, it's only 10:40.
- 10:40?

02:08.879 --> 02:10.130
Ah, crap, we gotta get out of here.

02:10.214 --> 02:11.548
That's when Taco Bell throws all

02:11.632 --> 02:13.342
the breakfast food in the Dumpster.

02:13.425 --> 02:15.177
Can't let that raccoon get all of it.

02:15.260 --> 02:17.346
- Ooh, man, you're right.
- You know, this is great, guys.

02:17.429 --> 02:19.139
Drinking and eating garbage.

02:19.223 --> 02:21.391
I'm glad we all took a mental health day.

02:22.559 --> 02:24.269
Hey, where'd everybody go?

02:24.353 --> 02:25.687
I don't know where they went,

02:25.771 --> 02:27.689
but someone's got to pay this check.

02:27.773 --> 02:30.692
Damn it. They left without me,
and now I'm stuck with the bill?

02:30.776 --> 02:33.695
Man, who do those guys think
I am, Mark Zuckerbrothers?

02:33.779 --> 02:35.489
Seems like they do that a lot.

02:35.572 --> 02:37.533
Tell you what, this one's on me.

02:37.616 --> 02:38.742
Thanks, Jerome.

02:38.825 --> 02:41.328
Since there's no one here,
do you mind turning the TV up?

02:41.411 --> 02:44.331
That little Lamisil guy
always makes me laugh.

02:44.414 --> 02:46.792
Yeah.

02:50.462 --> 02:51.964
What do you think he is, like a Martian?

02:52.047 --> 02:53.257
Like a little shoe Martian?

02:53.340 --> 02:54.591
I don't know.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.927
I just hope he ain't
down there in my shoes.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.345
No, he's loud.

02:58.428 --> 03:00.514
If he were down there, we'd know it.

03:00.597 --> 03:02.850
I ain't got no toenails no how.

03:07.437 --> 03:09.731
Hey, everybody, guess what.

03:09.815 --> 03:12.401
I'm running for homecoming king!

03:12.484 --> 03:14.987
- You're what?
- Yeah. Neil nominated me.

03:15.070 --> 03:16.989
Why are you home
from school and Meg's not?

03:17.072 --> 03:18.782
Has she taken a lover?

03:18.866 --> 03:21.618
Well, the voting is tomorrow,
so I've got to write my speech.

03:21.702 --> 03:25.163
Luckily, "Chris Griffin"
rhymes with "homecoming king,"

03:25.247 --> 03:27.124
so I've got my opening line.

03:28.333 --> 03:29.334
Oh, my God.

03:29.418 --> 03:31.378
Did you see how excited he is?

03:31.461 --> 03:34.047
- Yeah, isn't that great?
- No, it's not great.

03:34.131 --> 03:36.341
Chris is not homecoming king material.

03:36.425 --> 03:38.218
He doesn't have a chance of winning.

03:38.302 --> 03:39.761
We got to be at that school tomorrow

03:39.845 --> 03:41.221
to help pick up the pieces when he loses.

03:42.431 --> 03:43.473
Oh, my Hot Pocket!

03:44.349 --> 03:46.226
Ow, it's hot!

03:51.857 --> 03:53.358
Oh, that must be Jerome.

03:53.442 --> 03:54.651
What the hell is Jerome doing here?

03:54.735 --> 03:56.111
We didn't order any drinks.

03:56.195 --> 03:58.071
No, he and I got plans.

03:58.155 --> 03:59.865
We're gonna go down to Carver High School

03:59.948 --> 04:02.075
and look at that mural
of black achievement.

04:02.159 --> 04:06.121
Mm, they got a manila folder
taped over Dr. Cosby's face.

04:06.205 --> 04:09.666
What? Cleveland, you didn't tell us
you had plans with Jerome.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.293
Some things are my business.

04:11.376 --> 04:13.462
You don't tell me when
you play with yourself.

04:13.545 --> 04:15.005
Well, if you checked my Twitter feed,

04:15.088 --> 04:16.548
I wouldn't have to.

04:26.308 --> 04:30.729
And if you elect me, I will be as good
a homecoming king as a touchdown.

04:32.564 --> 04:34.066
And our final nominee

04:34.149 --> 04:36.276
for homecoming king is Chris Griffin.

04:39.154 --> 04:40.489
Thank you.

04:40.572 --> 04:41.865
I'm Chris Griffin.

04:41.949 --> 04:44.910
Webster's dictionary defines "smegma" as

04:44.993 --> 04:46.870
"a sebaceous, cheese-like substance

04:46.954 --> 04:49.164
around the head of the penis."

04:49.248 --> 04:51.667
But what is a "king"?

04:51.750 --> 04:53.669
Oh, God, this is already hard to watch.

04:53.752 --> 04:56.880
Like that <i>Bourne</i> movie where
they couldn't get Matt Damon.

04:56.964 --> 04:59.341
We're facing a biochemical
attack of untold proportions.

04:59.424 --> 05:01.301
Unfortunately,
Jason Bourne is not available.

05:01.385 --> 05:02.886
Who have we got?

05:02.970 --> 05:05.097
We have the sixth-billed
guy from <i>The Avengers.</i>

05:05.180 --> 05:06.974
The arrow guy who frowns a lot.

05:07.057 --> 05:08.308
Uh, okay.

05:08.392 --> 05:09.518
Does he look like Bourne?

05:09.601 --> 05:11.103
Yeah, yeah.

05:11.186 --> 05:12.896
He sort of looks like a young Popeye.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.940
Well, sounds like he's
the right guy for this.

05:15.023 --> 05:17.693
Yeah... yeah.

05:17.776 --> 05:19.695
All right, students.
The votes have been tabulated,

05:19.778 --> 05:22.990
so if you could all look up
from your phones for a minute,

05:23.073 --> 05:24.449
I'll tell you who won.

05:25.993 --> 05:28.704
Children. A man is talking.

05:28.787 --> 05:30.122
All right, I better head down there.

05:30.205 --> 05:31.498
I brought a bag of marshmallows

05:31.582 --> 05:34.543
and a belt for Chris to bite on
during his meltdown.

05:34.626 --> 05:38.589
And this year's James Woods High
homecoming king is...

05:38.672 --> 05:39.923
Chris Griffin.

05:40.007 --> 05:41.592
- Yay!

05:41.675 --> 05:44.386
Yay!

05:44.469 --> 05:45.971
Holy crap!

05:46.054 --> 05:48.140
I don't believe it. Chris won!

05:48.223 --> 05:50.559
All right, now it's time
for these four poor kids

05:50.642 --> 05:52.811
to thank you for
subsidizing their lunches.

05:52.895 --> 05:54.521
Thank you.

05:54.605 --> 05:56.190
Mean it.

05:56.273 --> 05:57.357
Thank you.

05:57.441 --> 05:58.734
All right.

05:58.817 --> 06:00.235
Time for my car nap.

06:08.911 --> 06:11.413
Hey, hey, hey, there he is! The new king!

06:11.496 --> 06:13.457
I already called and quit my job.

06:13.540 --> 06:15.417
Peter, he doesn't get money
for being homecoming king.

06:15.501 --> 06:18.045
- Does he get land?
- No, of course not.

06:18.128 --> 06:21.590
Does he get this joke? "Shagadelic, baby!"

06:21.673 --> 06:23.217
Austin Powers!

06:23.300 --> 06:25.636
Oh, very good. Very good, my liege.

06:25.719 --> 06:29.056
Well, Chris, since you're royalty now,
I made your favorites.

06:29.139 --> 06:31.391
- Dinner for breakfast?
- That's right.

06:31.475 --> 06:33.393
Pork chops and French onion soup.

06:33.477 --> 06:34.853
Oh, boy!

06:34.937 --> 06:37.189
Well, as king, I shall eat this breakfast

06:37.272 --> 06:40.192
on a tray in front of <i>Wheel of Fortune.</i>

06:40.275 --> 06:43.195
I'll get the TV tray, Your Majesty.

06:43.278 --> 06:45.405
How does nobody see what's going
on with this Chris thing?

06:45.489 --> 06:46.782
What are you talking about?

06:46.865 --> 06:48.450
Well, it's obvious.

06:48.534 --> 06:50.410
The only reason they elected him king

06:50.494 --> 06:52.663
is because they're gonna
prank him at homecoming.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.414
Shut up, Hat. That's my brother.

06:54.498 --> 06:56.208
They're not gonna mess with him.
He's the man.

06:56.291 --> 06:58.627
He's got real Griffin beef
in those trousers.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.295
Meg, how can you be so sure?

07:00.379 --> 07:02.005
Because this kind of stuff
happens all the time

07:02.089 --> 07:03.465
to unpopular kids.

07:03.549 --> 07:05.008
They're just trying to embarrass him

07:05.092 --> 07:06.510
and make him look stupid.

07:06.593 --> 07:07.803
You don't really think
they're going to pull

07:07.886 --> 07:08.971
a prank on Chris, do you?

07:09.054 --> 07:10.681
I don't know, but if they are,

07:10.764 --> 07:12.641
we got to get down to that
school and talk 'em out of it.

07:12.724 --> 07:15.018
Good idea.
And luckily, I'm great at connecting

07:15.102 --> 07:16.645
with that generation.

07:16.728 --> 07:19.648
Like when I went on that
campout with One Direction.

07:19.731 --> 07:22.192
So they checked into their hotel suite,

07:22.276 --> 07:25.070
but the minibar had no
sparkling water-- only still!

07:26.405 --> 07:27.614
Ah, stop. It's too scary.

07:27.698 --> 07:29.449
Oh, but that's not all.

07:29.533 --> 07:32.536
They looked in the wardrobe
and discovered that the stylist

07:32.619 --> 07:34.288
had only brought non-skinny jeans!

07:35.706 --> 07:37.833
Do mean like a Levi's 513 skinny straight?

07:37.916 --> 07:40.043
No. Just regular pants that fit normal!

07:41.753 --> 07:43.630
That's not real, right? Those aren't real?

07:43.714 --> 07:45.549
Of course not, Louis.
It's-it's just a story.

07:45.632 --> 07:47.467
Well, I guess that means
these aren't real!

07:48.719 --> 07:50.470
Yeah, they're gonna die in the woods.

07:50.554 --> 07:51.847
Simon, are they tagged?

07:51.930 --> 07:53.098
They're tagged, right?

07:53.182 --> 07:54.933
- Oh, they're tagged.
- Good.

07:55.017 --> 07:57.853
Simon, did I ever tell you the one
about the loose-fitting T-shirt?

07:57.936 --> 08:00.772
No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no...

08:04.818 --> 08:06.153
All right, if we want Cleveland

08:06.236 --> 08:07.738
to stop spending all his time with Jerome,

08:07.821 --> 08:09.323
we got to remind him how much fun we are.

08:09.406 --> 08:11.658
- So let's just have fun.
- How do we do that?

08:11.742 --> 08:12.910
I don't know.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.870
Little bit of this.

08:14.953 --> 08:16.496
Okay. That seems like fun.

08:16.580 --> 08:18.290
What about one of these?

08:18.373 --> 08:19.499
Yeah, sure. There's no wrong moves.

08:19.583 --> 08:21.710
What if I brush my shoulders off?

08:21.793 --> 08:24.379
Original ideas are preferred, but sure.

08:24.463 --> 08:27.090
Three fun guys, room for four.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.300
I don't know if it's working, Peter.

08:28.383 --> 08:29.510
I don't know if it's fun.

08:29.593 --> 08:31.303
It's more than fun, it's "foon."

08:31.386 --> 08:32.888
That's a fun way to say "fun."

08:32.971 --> 08:35.724
Hey, how foon would it be
if we waved sticks around?

08:35.807 --> 08:37.601
I-I really don't know what we're doing.

08:37.684 --> 08:39.144
It's foon, from the word before.

08:39.228 --> 08:40.979
I don't see what's...

08:41.063 --> 08:43.732
All right, first,
let's take your blood pressure,

08:43.815 --> 08:45.359
'cause that's-that's
like our favorite thing

08:45.442 --> 08:46.944
to do around here.

08:50.656 --> 08:52.824
Okay, we all know how much
Cleveland loves <i>Tecmo Bowl,</i>

08:52.950 --> 08:54.409
so let's start playing.

08:54.535 --> 08:55.536
I'm the Raiders. I'm Bo Jackson.

08:55.619 --> 08:57.162
And hopefully, he'll show up.

08:57.246 --> 08:58.914
That's no fair. Bo Jackson's too fast.

08:58.997 --> 09:00.958
Guys, do we want
Cleveland back or don't...

09:01.041 --> 09:02.209
Uhp, here we go.

09:02.292 --> 09:04.586
Bye-bye.

09:04.711 --> 09:05.796
See, Peter? He's too fast.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.339
You got to tackle me. It's "B."

09:07.422 --> 09:08.715
You got to press "B."

09:08.799 --> 09:10.551
I'm pressing "B." He's too fast.

09:10.634 --> 09:12.010
Going over here.

09:12.094 --> 09:13.428
Going over here now.

09:13.512 --> 09:14.763
Never get tired.

09:14.847 --> 09:16.723
Change your guy, Quagmire.

09:16.807 --> 09:17.975
Change your guy.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.309
I'm trying. Peter's cheating.

09:19.393 --> 09:20.519
You're cheating, Peter.

09:20.644 --> 09:21.812
I'm not cheating.
I'm following the rules.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.355
I'm just really good.

09:23.438 --> 09:25.774
You're not really good.
You just got Bo Jackson.

09:25.858 --> 09:28.777
Bo Jackson also played
professional baseball.

09:28.861 --> 09:30.445
Shut up, Joe.
Everybody knows that.

09:30.571 --> 09:31.738
Kansas City.

09:31.822 --> 09:32.948
Royals.

09:33.031 --> 09:34.741
Can't stop. Won't stop.

09:34.825 --> 09:39.580
Bo... might... go... all... the...

09:39.663 --> 09:41.373
Nope, going back the other way.

09:41.456 --> 09:43.208
What? Are you going backwards? Just score.

09:43.292 --> 09:45.002
Nah, I'm gonna run
out the quarter.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.171
I'm not playing now.
My controller's down.

09:47.254 --> 09:49.047
Seems like your
controller's been down the whole time.

09:49.131 --> 09:52.009
Who's Veris?
You got to switch off Veris.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.261
Get it to Ronnie Lott.

09:54.344 --> 09:57.055
Pretty much anyone but Veris.

09:57.139 --> 09:59.766
Oh, no, I'm all the
way back here now.

09:59.850 --> 10:01.852
I'm in my own end zone. What am I doing?

10:01.935 --> 10:04.813
Too bad I'm not Bo Jackson.
Oh, wait. I am!

10:04.897 --> 10:06.231
Ridiculous.

10:06.315 --> 10:07.983
Oh, yeah.

10:08.066 --> 10:09.484
There you go, Quagmire.

10:09.568 --> 10:11.987
You're about to tackle me. But then...

10:12.070 --> 10:13.989
Damn it!

10:14.072 --> 10:15.199
Less than a minute.

10:15.282 --> 10:16.617
Shut up, Joe!

10:16.700 --> 10:18.869
He's gonna do it. He might do this.

10:18.952 --> 10:21.288
I don't know, a lot of football
still to be played here.

10:21.371 --> 10:22.623
I'm hitting reset.

10:22.706 --> 10:23.790
Don't you dare hit reset.

10:23.874 --> 10:25.209
You hit reset, you're banned for life.

10:25.292 --> 10:26.460
I hate this.

10:26.543 --> 10:27.794
Joe, do you want to play?

10:27.878 --> 10:29.796
Nah, I like being this guy.

10:29.880 --> 10:32.424
A zig. A zag. A touchdown!

10:32.508 --> 10:34.843
Yeah!

10:34.927 --> 10:36.011
<i>I won the game</i>

10:36.094 --> 10:37.721
<i>And now I'm gonna jump</i>

10:37.804 --> 10:39.097
<i>Bo Jackson!</i>

10:40.766 --> 10:42.726
All right, if we want
to get Cleveland back,

10:44.561 --> 10:45.854
an open can of tuna.

10:45.938 --> 10:48.690
Often he'll come running
when he hears a can opening.

10:48.774 --> 10:50.526
Peter, stop.

10:50.609 --> 10:53.862
Yeah, I think it's time we addressed
the elephant in the room.

10:53.946 --> 10:55.197
There's a simple reason

10:55.280 --> 10:57.741
Cleveland is hanging out
with Jerome and not us.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.618
Jerome is black and we're not.

10:59.701 --> 11:00.827
Yeah, I mean, you can't blame him.

11:00.911 --> 11:02.746
It's just a thing they have in common.

11:02.829 --> 11:04.039
Something they can bond over.

11:04.122 --> 11:05.749
Well, I guess that makes sense.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.668
I suppose people do want
to be with their own kind.

11:07.751 --> 11:10.671
Like the audience at a
Decemberists concert.

11:10.754 --> 11:12.673
Good evening, white guys who weigh less

11:12.756 --> 11:14.299
than their girlfriends.

11:22.182 --> 11:25.769
God, a lot of gym teacher
suicide memorials in this place.

11:25.853 --> 11:27.479
All right, let's find
the coolest kids here,

11:27.563 --> 11:29.565
and see if they know anything
about a prank on Chris.

11:29.648 --> 11:31.900
Those chicks in the
skirts look pretty cool.

11:31.984 --> 11:34.319
Hey there. Brian Rockwell.

11:34.403 --> 11:35.946
This is my friend, Stewie Goldberg.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.489
What?

11:37.573 --> 11:38.782
I don't know my way around the school,

11:38.866 --> 11:40.868
so I figured I'd get the deets
from a couple of seniors.

11:40.951 --> 11:42.119
Download me.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.872
Brian-- it's not Goldberg, by the way--
we should ask about the prank.

11:44.955 --> 11:46.498
I'm earning their trust.

11:46.582 --> 11:49.293
Hey, uh, I'm new here,
but you know what'd be crazy?

11:49.376 --> 11:52.754
If me, a guy,
went in the girls' room with you two.

11:52.838 --> 11:54.882
I mean, that would be,
that would be so wild.

11:54.965 --> 11:56.925
We should, we should
totally just go in there.

11:57.009 --> 11:59.136
- Brian, stop.
- That'd be hilarious.

11:59.219 --> 12:00.387
I'm in.

12:00.470 --> 12:01.930
Stewie, go wait in the car.

12:02.014 --> 12:03.724
No, we are here to get
information about Chris.

12:03.807 --> 12:05.851
I said, go wait in the car.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.607
They had security guards in the bathroom.

12:11.690 --> 12:14.776
We-we live in such a culture of fear now.

12:18.864 --> 12:21.533
Hey, guys, what are you doing here?

12:21.617 --> 12:23.160
And why are you dressed like that?

12:23.243 --> 12:24.995
Well, we realized you like
hanging out with Jerome

12:25.078 --> 12:26.580
because he's black,

12:26.663 --> 12:29.166
so we wanted you to know
we can be black guys, too.

12:29.249 --> 12:32.169
Yeah, in fact, we can even
be famous movie black guys.

12:32.252 --> 12:33.545
I'm Bagger Vance.

12:33.629 --> 12:35.214
I also am Bagger Vance.

12:35.297 --> 12:37.341
I'm Kazaam from <i>Kazaam.</i>

12:37.424 --> 12:40.844
You really think I'm only hanging out
with Jerome 'cause he's black?

12:40.928 --> 12:43.805
I hang out with Jerome because,
unlike some people,

12:43.889 --> 12:46.558
he actually takes an interest in my life.

12:46.642 --> 12:48.352
And he would never stick me with the bill

12:48.435 --> 12:50.521
by walking out on me at the Clam.

12:52.231 --> 12:54.358
Well, we could have come over
and graciously apologized,

12:54.441 --> 12:55.817
but we took a chance.

12:55.901 --> 12:58.028
That's what I like about us.

13:03.033 --> 13:04.868
Sucks we didn't find
out what kind of prank

13:04.952 --> 13:06.036
they're gonna pull on Chris.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.956
I know that book is <i>The Hunger Games</i>
with the cover taken off.

13:09.039 --> 13:10.999
Oh, look, something on TV.

13:11.083 --> 13:14.002
And finally, tonight, a moving
story from James Woods High,

13:14.086 --> 13:17.047
where the student body has made
their homecoming a special event

13:17.130 --> 13:19.341
for a very special boy.

13:19.424 --> 13:21.009
And this year's James Woods High

13:21.093 --> 13:24.596
homecoming king is... Chris Griffin.

13:24.680 --> 13:26.682
Yay!

13:26.765 --> 13:29.017
Yay!

13:29.101 --> 13:30.602
That's right. Chris Griffin,

13:30.686 --> 13:33.021
a tubby spaz with a heart full of dreams,

13:33.105 --> 13:35.023
gets to feel normal for a night,

13:35.107 --> 13:37.025
thanks to the kindness of his peers.

13:37.109 --> 13:39.820
Oh.

13:39.903 --> 13:43.031
I just see him walking around
with his hands down his pants all day,

13:43.115 --> 13:46.702
and he's just so fat and weird,
so we feel bad.

13:46.785 --> 13:50.247
Yeah, last year we did the burnt
up kid, so this was a slam dunk.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.499
Oh, my God, they just
elected him out of pity,

13:52.583 --> 13:54.293
because they think he's
mentally challenged.

13:54.376 --> 13:56.837
Kind of like we did with George W. Bush.

13:56.920 --> 13:59.089
Huh? Right?

13:59.173 --> 14:01.925
I-I guess. I guess, Brian.

14:02.009 --> 14:03.218
I-I don't-- I don't know.

14:03.302 --> 14:04.386
Let's-let's just watch some commercials.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.437
Well, that explains it.

14:13.520 --> 14:14.938
The only reason Chris is homecoming king

14:15.022 --> 14:16.940
is that all the other
kids feel sorry for him.

14:17.024 --> 14:18.025
Do you think he knows?

14:18.108 --> 14:19.234
I can't imagine.

14:19.318 --> 14:21.862
And we can't tell him.
It would destroy him.

14:24.239 --> 14:25.365
Look away!

14:25.449 --> 14:27.743
No one may meet the king's gaze.

14:28.118 --> 14:31.872
So, uh, hey,
congratulations again on that, uh,

14:31.955 --> 14:33.081
homecoming thing.

14:33.165 --> 14:36.752
Why congratulate me on a right
and natural turn of events?

14:36.835 --> 14:39.505
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I shall select three things

14:39.588 --> 14:41.924
from Stewie's room that I wish to be mine.

14:42.007 --> 14:44.551
There's a book in there
on how to eat healthy.

14:44.635 --> 14:46.762
Why don't you take that, you fat bitch?

14:46.845 --> 14:49.056
Well, he obviously doesn't
know it's just a pity vote.

14:49.139 --> 14:51.058
In fact, this whole homecoming king thing

14:51.141 --> 14:53.143
seems to have just gone
straight to his head.

14:53.227 --> 14:55.103
I know, he's acting like an arrogant jerk.

14:55.187 --> 14:56.730
Quiet, Rupert!

14:56.813 --> 14:58.941
It is an honor to serve
the king in this manner.

14:59.024 --> 15:01.902
Brian, this can't go on.
Chris is out of control.

15:01.985 --> 15:04.696
He's even more arrogant
than an actor/writer/director.

15:04.780 --> 15:07.282
Well, my script is brilliant,
and I'm a great director.

15:07.366 --> 15:11.036
The question is,
how bad do I want this part?

15:12.996 --> 15:15.207
Okay, I'll do it.

15:20.087 --> 15:23.090
Well, now we know.
Neither of us likes crepes.

15:23.173 --> 15:25.717
See, that's another thing
we got in common.

15:25.801 --> 15:27.761
In fact, you want to hear something crazy?

15:27.845 --> 15:30.722
Peter and the fellas think that
you and I only hang out together

15:30.806 --> 15:32.182
because we're both black.

15:32.266 --> 15:33.517
Uh-huh.

15:33.600 --> 15:34.935
But I told them that's insulting.

15:35.018 --> 15:36.353
Why is that insulting?

15:36.436 --> 15:37.938
People like to be with their own.

15:38.021 --> 15:40.107
I mean, you don't think
I hang out with you because

15:40.190 --> 15:43.026
of your endless stories about
working your remote control

15:43.110 --> 15:47.030
or your fat son or how you once
made a dog shake its head "no"?

15:47.114 --> 15:50.325
I manipulated the
cheeseburger what like this.

15:50.409 --> 15:52.035
You boring, man.

15:52.119 --> 15:53.704
But you're black, so we cool.

15:53.787 --> 15:55.789
That's racist. I'm offended.

15:55.873 --> 15:58.750
Whatever. I'll see you around, Cleveland.

15:58.834 --> 16:02.796
Man, I guess this whole
friendship was a bad idea.

16:02.880 --> 16:06.049
Just like Goodyear's advertising strategy.

16:06.133 --> 16:08.051
All right, we have $14 million
to play with.

16:08.135 --> 16:11.096
I say we spend it all on blimps,
'cause who do we want to reach?

16:11.180 --> 16:13.015
Drivers.

16:13.098 --> 16:14.766
And where are people looking
when they're driving a car?

16:14.850 --> 16:16.226
Straight up.

16:20.230 --> 16:22.983
Squire, my chamber pot needs emptying.

16:23.066 --> 16:24.443
What's he talking about?

16:24.526 --> 16:26.195
He's been pooping in the waffle iron.

16:26.278 --> 16:28.405
Just plug it in and close it.
It'll burn off.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.824
Look, Chris, you know,
being homecoming king

16:30.908 --> 16:33.035
doesn't mean you can
just start acting crazy.

16:33.118 --> 16:35.078
I can do whatever I want.

16:35.162 --> 16:38.248
I've been acknowledged
by my peers as their superior.

16:38.332 --> 16:40.417
You're just jealous 'cause
you've never done anything

16:40.501 --> 16:42.377
that deserves being elected king.

16:42.461 --> 16:44.171
Okay, you want to know the truth?

16:44.254 --> 16:46.048
They only picked you
because they felt sorry for you.

16:46.131 --> 16:47.174
Sorry?

16:47.257 --> 16:48.884
Why would they feel sorry for me?

16:48.967 --> 16:51.470
Well, because they all think
you're a, um, you know,

16:51.553 --> 16:55.265
"groundskeeper at a public
institution" kind of guy.

16:55.349 --> 16:56.433
A what?

16:56.517 --> 16:58.810
A dope. An idiot. A water head.

16:58.894 --> 17:01.271
You guys don't know
what you're talking about.

17:01.355 --> 17:04.066
Tonight, when they put
that crown on my head,

17:04.149 --> 17:06.401
it's gonna be the
greatest night of my life.

17:06.485 --> 17:09.905
Even better than when I had my first kiss.

17:33.762 --> 17:36.849
I say, we were a little hard on Chris,
but I'm glad we came.

17:36.932 --> 17:38.267
He's still my brother.

17:38.350 --> 17:40.143
Hey, look, there's the security guard

17:40.227 --> 17:41.728
that threw me out of the bathroom earlier.

17:41.812 --> 17:43.313
And he's here with his wife.

17:43.397 --> 17:45.482
This is like a date for them.

17:45.566 --> 17:48.068
Good evening, fingerers and fingerees.

17:48.151 --> 17:50.153
Sorry, I had a little rum in the car.

17:50.237 --> 17:53.282
Anyway, please welcome your
homecoming king, Chris Griffin.

17:57.035 --> 17:59.246
Good evening, subjects.

17:59.329 --> 18:03.250
The boys' showers shall run red
with the blood of my enemies.

18:03.333 --> 18:04.668
We believe in you!

18:04.751 --> 18:06.920
- Good for you, Chris!
- No one clap too loud.

18:07.004 --> 18:08.714
We don't want to frighten him.

18:08.797 --> 18:10.090
Wait a minute.

18:10.174 --> 18:13.302
And now your queen,
prom night car crash victim

18:13.385 --> 18:15.179
Kathleen Fitzpatrick.

18:17.014 --> 18:18.098
Aw.

18:18.182 --> 18:19.516
We miss you, Kathleen!

18:19.600 --> 18:21.101
You're heaven's queen now!

18:21.185 --> 18:22.686
Wow, she was hot.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.897
The queen is a dead girl?

18:24.980 --> 18:26.565
What does that make me?

18:26.648 --> 18:28.734
Brian and Stewie were right.

18:28.817 --> 18:30.569
This was a pity vote.

18:30.652 --> 18:32.112
We love you, Chris!

18:32.196 --> 18:33.322
You love me?

18:33.405 --> 18:35.282
You don't even know anything about me.

18:35.365 --> 18:38.243
You just voted for me
to make yourselves feel better.

18:41.038 --> 18:43.624
She was on PCP that night, you idiots!

18:50.631 --> 18:53.217
Chris, I-I'm so sorry.

18:53.300 --> 18:56.136
That's okay. You guys tried to warn me.

18:56.220 --> 18:57.763
I'm sorry I was such a jerk.

18:57.846 --> 18:58.931
Ah, don't worry about it.

18:59.014 --> 19:00.015
Are you okay?

19:00.098 --> 19:02.809
You know what? I am.

19:02.893 --> 19:06.522
I may not be king,
but I learned I don't need anyone's pity.

19:06.605 --> 19:07.981
That's the spirit, Chris.

19:08.065 --> 19:09.942
And, hey, you're not the homecoming king,

19:10.025 --> 19:12.319
but you'll always be my brother.

19:12.402 --> 19:13.695
Thanks, Stewie.

19:13.779 --> 19:15.364
It means a lot to me to know

19:15.447 --> 19:18.158
I've always got my family
looking out for me.

19:18.242 --> 19:19.952
Oh, hey, Chris.

19:20.035 --> 19:21.620
This is Tyler.

19:22.162 --> 19:24.665
Don't make this weird now.

19:24.748 --> 19:27.292
Oh, what a gentleman.

19:34.675 --> 19:36.844
Well, Cleveland, it's good
to have you back, buddy.

19:36.927 --> 19:38.345
It's good to be back.

19:38.428 --> 19:39.596
Hanging with Jerome was fun,

19:39.680 --> 19:42.391
but my best friends are
right here in this room.

19:42.474 --> 19:44.184
Hey, to celebrate,
how about we play a little

19:44.268 --> 19:46.395
old-school <i>Double Dribble?</i>

19:46.478 --> 19:48.397
Okay, but no stupid-ass
shots from the corner,

19:48.480 --> 19:49.982
because that's a glitch
in the software and...

19:50.065 --> 19:51.358
Game on!

19:53.527 --> 19:56.446
All right, bring it up
the court, and corner three!

19:56.530 --> 19:58.657
No, no.
That's what I'm talking about!

19:58.740 --> 20:00.284
Steal.

20:00.367 --> 20:03.203
Uhp, corner three.

20:03.287 --> 20:05.581
All right, here we go.
I got something cooking.

20:05.664 --> 20:07.583
Uhp, you dropped something.

20:07.666 --> 20:10.586
Think I'll head over in this direction.
Corner three!

20:10.669 --> 20:12.296
It's a rout. It's a blowout.

20:12.379 --> 20:13.839
It's some bullcrap.

20:13.922 --> 20:16.049
Couple nice passes there... hey!

20:16.133 --> 20:17.259
See? Competitive ball game.

20:17.342 --> 20:19.887
What should I do? Pass and then go up?

20:19.970 --> 20:22.222
And corner three!

20:22.347 --> 20:24.433
All right,
enough of this mess.

20:24.516 --> 20:26.310
Shoot it! Shoot it from there.

20:26.393 --> 20:29.438
The refs are lettin' 'em play.
I do appreciate that.

20:29.521 --> 20:30.689
Yeah, that's what
I'm talkin' about.

20:30.772 --> 20:32.065
Now I'm playing for reals.

20:32.149 --> 20:34.443
Yeah, you're doing pretty good.
What play should I call now?

20:34.526 --> 20:36.236
Maybe... corner three!

20:36.320 --> 20:37.821
He's hot. He is hot.

20:37.905 --> 20:39.406
Keep feeding that guy.

20:39.489 --> 20:41.241
Hi, nice to meet you.
Can I have that?

20:41.325 --> 20:42.618
Hang out over here for a second.

20:42.701 --> 20:44.286
Corner three!

20:44.369 --> 20:45.579
You got to get out there, Cleveland.

20:45.662 --> 20:47.122
I'm trying.

20:47.206 --> 20:49.458
He's taking advantage of poor technology.

20:49.541 --> 20:50.918
Uhp, lot of dribbling. Swipe.

20:51.001 --> 20:53.462
Here we... aw, I hit the wrong button.

20:53.545 --> 20:55.881
I think you all know I was
going for a corner three.
