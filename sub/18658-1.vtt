02:29.000 --> 02:31.900
<i>Now I am the richest person in the world.</i>

02:32.400 --> 02:35.700
<i>I am the richest person in the world.</i>

02:37.200 --> 02:41.200
Now I am the richest person in the world.

02:41.600 --> 02:45.600
I am the richest person in the world. I am...

02:48.300 --> 02:51.100
<i>Mi capit√°n,</i> not another ship in sight.

02:52.900 --> 02:55.100
Yes, King Carlos should be very pleased.

02:55.100 --> 02:58.000
Tell me, who is more important to please...

02:58.600 --> 03:01.600
the King of Spain or God?

03:02.400 --> 03:04.400
Well, God, of course.

03:04.400 --> 03:08.000
And who is God's personal representative
in this vicinity?

03:08.800 --> 03:11.600
Well, you are, Your Blessed Rectitude.

03:11.900 --> 03:14.300
Well, God wants to keep all of it.

03:15.800 --> 03:16.800
But...

03:17.000 --> 03:21.000
And anybody who dares "buts"
God's personal representative...

03:21.100 --> 03:24.100
will soon find his head pierced
and his neck stretched...

03:24.200 --> 03:27.200
and will go on to meet God very quickly!

03:27.800 --> 03:30.400
Which is more than anybody
could reasonably hope for...

03:30.500 --> 03:32.500
Your Holy Ruthlessness.

03:33.600 --> 03:37.200
Instead, you may bang your head
on the floor until forgiven.

04:56.700 --> 04:59.300
Congratulations, Captain Yellowbeard.

04:59.800 --> 05:04.700
- I'm glad my plan was a success.
- Your plan, my gold.

05:05.100 --> 05:08.500
Hands off my treasure, Bosun Moon!

05:10.100 --> 05:11.700
I said hands off!

05:13.100 --> 05:15.600
Do I have to do everything myself?

06:15.000 --> 06:17.100
Come now, don't slow down.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.000
- Step over him.
- Move it.

06:19.100 --> 06:22.300
- Step out of the way.
- We've got another one here now.

06:24.100 --> 06:25.400
Over here.

06:25.500 --> 06:27.800
Bloody hell, another one. Bloody witches.

06:27.900 --> 06:31.200
Corpses, corpses, all day long. Never stops.

06:32.200 --> 06:36.200
You know, Gilbert, being a prisoner's
not what it was when I came in here.

06:37.100 --> 06:38.500
Here we go.

06:39.400 --> 06:42.400
Whimpering poncies.
They get a leg broken and they faint.

06:42.500 --> 06:45.400
A few fingernails pulled out,
they start crying.

06:45.500 --> 06:47.400
When they stretched me on a rack
for a couple of years...

06:47.500 --> 06:50.300
I didn't go around dying all over the place.

06:53.200 --> 06:56.500
Pathetic. Taking the easy way out like that.

06:56.600 --> 06:57.900
How do you mean exactly?

06:58.000 --> 07:01.000
Dying. He'd only been in 15 years.

07:01.000 --> 07:05.200
You won't catch me dying.
They'll have to kill me before I die.

07:05.900 --> 07:08.700
Many a man has tried, Captain Yellowbeard.

07:09.600 --> 07:12.000
And soon you will be at large again.

07:12.100 --> 07:14.800
With a hand-picked crew
of the hardest buccaneers...

07:14.800 --> 07:17.700
that have ever stained
the seven seas with Spanish blood.

07:17.800 --> 07:21.300
It was most unjust I thought,
locking you up for...

07:21.500 --> 07:23.500
merely doing your duty.

07:23.500 --> 07:27.100
Twenty years for killing 5,000 dagos
and frogs.

07:27.200 --> 07:30.500
Betrayed by me right-hand man,
that bastard Moon.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.500
But he never found out
where you hid the treasure, did he?

07:33.600 --> 07:35.500
No! Nor will he ever.

07:37.100 --> 07:39.600
Where did you hide the treasure, actually?

07:40.200 --> 07:43.000
You won't catch me
with those trick questions.

07:44.400 --> 07:46.800
What really pisses me off, is...

07:47.400 --> 07:50.000
- What is it now?
- You've got a visitor.

07:50.100 --> 07:53.000
I expect that'll be the Queen
with my pardon.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.500
- Hello, sugar drawers.
- What, you again?

08:10.700 --> 08:14.100
Again? I haven't seen you for 15 years.

08:14.300 --> 08:16.000
What is it this time?

08:16.100 --> 08:19.000
Well, what with you being let out
next week...

08:19.300 --> 08:24.200
I thought it was my duty as a wife
to bring you up to date on a few things.

08:24.500 --> 08:28.300
Now, do you remember just before
you were arrested we were having a cuddle?

08:28.400 --> 08:31.900
- I was raping you, if that's what you mean.
- All right.

08:32.299 --> 08:36.100
- Sort of half cuddle, half rape.
- Get on with it, woman!

08:37.600 --> 08:41.299
Well, I haven't told you this before,
because I wanted him to be brought up...

08:41.400 --> 08:43.700
like a gentleman and not a pirate.

08:44.200 --> 08:45.900
Who are you talking about?

08:46.400 --> 08:50.200
- The fruit of your loins, sugar drawers.
- Are you mad, woman?

08:50.300 --> 08:53.800
I haven't got fruit in my loins.
Lice, yes, and proud of them!

08:53.800 --> 08:57.200
It means that we have spawned a son.

08:57.300 --> 08:58.400
Done what?

08:58.900 --> 09:01.100
You have just become the father...

09:01.200 --> 09:05.100
of a 20-year-old bouncing boy called Dan.

09:06.300 --> 09:09.000
A son. Takes after me, does he?

09:09.800 --> 09:10.700
Well...

09:10.900 --> 09:14.500
By the time I was 20, I'd killed 500 men.

09:14.700 --> 09:18.200
Well, he's not quite so extroverted as you,
but he's...

09:18.300 --> 09:20.200
- A thief?
- No.

09:20.300 --> 09:22.600
- A rapist?
- No.

09:22.700 --> 09:26.200
- Bloody hell. I give up. What is he then?
- He's a gardener.

09:26.300 --> 09:31.200
A gardener? A Yellowbeard gardening?
I'll see about that when I'm out.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.200
- What is it now?
- Time's up, sir.

09:37.200 --> 09:39.900
So your son's a gardener, eh?

09:49.000 --> 09:52.400
- There you are, Mr. Pew.
- I said a double.

09:52.400 --> 09:57.000
- Did you?
- I know a double when I hears one. When!

10:02.000 --> 10:03.400
Dan's coming.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.800
Reading as usual.

10:13.800 --> 10:15.900
There you are, Dan.

10:18.500 --> 10:21.800
- Got a moment?
- I'm reading something.

10:21.900 --> 10:23.400
Read, read.

10:23.700 --> 10:25.800
Read, read, read.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.300
There's more important things in life
than reading, Son.

10:30.800 --> 10:33.100
Keep an ear on the bar,
would you, Mr. Pew?

10:33.100 --> 10:34.200
Right.

10:34.400 --> 10:36.700
If there's one thing I've learned in life...

10:36.700 --> 10:39.300
it's that learning things
never taught me nothing.

10:39.400 --> 10:42.200
- And books is the worst.
- All right, Mother.

10:42.800 --> 10:46.600
Last time I read a book, I was raped.

10:47.400 --> 10:51.400
- So let that be a lesson to you.
- What do you want?

10:52.400 --> 10:54.300
Well, it's about your father.

10:55.900 --> 10:57.200
What about him?

10:58.500 --> 11:00.500
Well, when I said he was dead...

11:01.100 --> 11:04.900
- I was only trying to cushion the blow.
- What blow?

11:05.500 --> 11:06.700
He's alive.

11:07.500 --> 11:11.200
He's alive and imprisoned as a pirate.

11:11.900 --> 11:13.200
A pirate?

11:15.000 --> 11:18.700
- Like Yellowbeard?
- Very much like Yellowbeard, yes.

11:18.700 --> 11:20.900
In fact, he is Yellowbeard.

11:34.700 --> 11:36.300
No, thank you, sir.

11:46.600 --> 11:48.900
Commander Clement, Royal Navy.

12:03.600 --> 12:05.600
Welcome, Commander Clement.

12:06.200 --> 12:09.200
Her Majesty's temporary throne room...

12:09.300 --> 12:13.400
- is in the huge withdrawing room.
- Thank you, Lady Lambourn.

12:20.300 --> 12:23.900
Lambourn, stop that man
pissing on the hedge.

12:24.200 --> 12:26.000
It's imported!

12:27.500 --> 12:30.600
You, come here! You, stop that at once!

12:30.700 --> 12:33.300
That comes special, all the way from Egypt!

12:49.200 --> 12:50.200
Next...

12:51.400 --> 12:54.400
the head of Her Majesty's Secret Service.

12:54.500 --> 12:56.900
Not to be read out loud.

13:00.700 --> 13:02.700
Excuse me. Joking apart.

13:04.700 --> 13:07.400
Royal Navy Commander Clement.

13:28.200 --> 13:31.300
The fat one on the throne is the Queen.

13:33.600 --> 13:36.900
She's not very well today,
so I should kneel upwind of her.

13:38.300 --> 13:41.900
And the thin one is Lady Churchill.
She's the brains of the outfit.

13:48.500 --> 13:53.000
- State your business.
- Your Majesty, we in the Naval Department...

13:53.000 --> 13:57.100
while being keenly aware of recent spirals
in Defense expenditure...

13:57.200 --> 14:00.100
- humbly submit...
- Are you the Prime Minister?

14:02.800 --> 14:04.300
Secret Service.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.600
Charades!

14:09.600 --> 14:13.400
- You're a beekeeper.
- That'll do for her.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.500
- Will it?
- What do you want?

14:17.500 --> 14:20.600
The pirate Yellowbeard
is due to be released in two days...

14:20.600 --> 14:23.800
and despite years of unpleasantness,
he's still told us nothing...

14:23.800 --> 14:25.500
of the treasure he's hidden.

14:25.500 --> 14:28.400
However, I have a detailed plan here.

14:28.500 --> 14:32.400
I doubt if she could manage
more than the label on a gin bottle.

14:32.600 --> 14:34.100
Just tell us.

14:34.800 --> 14:38.600
Well, milady, we'd like you to increase
his sentence, so he's bound to escape...

14:38.700 --> 14:43.200
and make straight for the treasure.
I shall need a fast ship to follow him.

14:43.300 --> 14:47.300
A sensible request, I think, Your Majesty.

14:51.100 --> 14:54.600
The beekeeper would like this signed.

14:55.100 --> 14:56.300
Certainly.

15:01.500 --> 15:04.800
- Come on, move it, you ratbag!
- Get in there!

15:06.500 --> 15:10.100
- Mr. Yellowbeard.
- Captain to you, you scum.

15:10.200 --> 15:14.400
Quite. Sorry, "Captain" Yellowbeard.

15:16.300 --> 15:20.300
Yes. Twenty years ago today,
you were sentenced to jail.

15:20.400 --> 15:22.800
Yes, and now I'm due to be released.

15:22.900 --> 15:25.200
Yes. Or rather no.

15:25.700 --> 15:27.500
You see, 20 years ago...

15:27.600 --> 15:31.400
no one was expected
to live in jail for 20 years.

15:31.600 --> 15:35.800
Filthy, horrendous conditions
that existed then, and, indeed...

15:36.300 --> 15:38.000
still exist today.

15:38.100 --> 15:41.700
So the judge who sentenced you
had no idea you would survive.

15:42.300 --> 15:45.100
Therefore, Her Majesty
has graciously agreed...

15:45.100 --> 15:48.900
to increase your sentence
a further 140 years. Case dismissed.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.100
I've got him!

15:52.000 --> 15:53.000
Sorry.

15:59.500 --> 16:02.000
- Get off of me!
- What are you doing?

16:02.800 --> 16:03.900
Stop him! Stop him!

16:06.700 --> 16:08.800
Get over there where you belong!

16:11.000 --> 16:14.500
- Went well with the Commander then, did it?
- No.

16:15.500 --> 16:19.500
So I can take it you won't be leaving us
just yet, as it were.

16:19.600 --> 16:22.000
They broke their solemn word.

16:22.900 --> 16:25.100
There's governments for you.

16:25.500 --> 16:28.500
I expect they wanted to know
about the treasure.

16:28.600 --> 16:31.500
Yes, and that's something
they'll never know.

16:32.100 --> 16:34.800
Well, until you tell them about the treasure...

16:35.900 --> 16:39.300
the only way you're gonna get out of here
is feet first.

16:39.400 --> 16:43.400
- Open the gate!
- Must be an awful strain...

16:43.500 --> 16:46.600
being the only man in the world
knowing where it's hidden.

16:47.700 --> 16:51.200
Why don't you share the burden
with a friend?

16:54.800 --> 16:56.000
Gilbert.

16:57.400 --> 16:58.600
Mr. Moon?

17:00.500 --> 17:03.600
- Is that you?
- Get a move on, Gilbert.

17:06.400 --> 17:09.200
Coming, Captain. Here I come.

17:29.200 --> 17:31.000
Move, you scum.

17:39.500 --> 17:42.500
- Yellowbeard.
- Who was that stink?

17:52.700 --> 17:57.200
I do wish it didn't have to be
such a rush every time.

17:57.200 --> 17:58.300
What?

18:00.800 --> 18:03.300
I haven't got time for that now!

18:03.400 --> 18:07.100
Well, it's been 20 years
since we had a little cuddle...

18:07.300 --> 18:11.500
and what do you do?
Come in here and give me a kiss?

18:11.500 --> 18:15.900
No. You rush in and hack a hole in the wall.

18:16.000 --> 18:19.300
- Where's the map?
- What map?

18:19.600 --> 18:23.200
If you say you don't know where it is...

18:23.300 --> 18:26.500
I'll nail your tits to the table!

18:29.000 --> 18:30.500
Oh, dear!

18:31.000 --> 18:32.700
I know where it is.

18:33.200 --> 18:34.600
It's burnt.

18:34.900 --> 18:37.200
You burnt my map?

18:37.300 --> 18:41.500
- But only after I copied it.
- Where's the copy?

18:41.600 --> 18:45.400
- When little Dan came along...
- Who's Dan?

18:45.800 --> 18:49.000
My and probably your son!

18:49.800 --> 18:52.800
When little Dan was two minutes old...

18:53.200 --> 18:55.400
I tattooed it on his head.

18:56.200 --> 18:59.500
- Does he know about this?
- No. Nor nobody else, neither.

18:59.600 --> 19:02.800
That's why I kept him
in the cupboard for three years.

19:03.600 --> 19:06.000
That may be why he's a bit odd...

19:06.100 --> 19:09.400
with all these books and reading
and stuff like that.

19:09.600 --> 19:12.800
- Where is he now?
- Lambourn Hall.

19:13.200 --> 19:16.000
Right. I'll go up there and cut his head off.

19:16.100 --> 19:18.600
Where's my pirating outfit?

19:21.700 --> 19:23.300
Royal Navy here.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.000
Where's Yellowbeard?

19:31.100 --> 19:32.500
Yellowbeard!

19:34.500 --> 19:37.400
Where is Yellowbeard?

19:38.000 --> 19:39.400
He's...

19:41.000 --> 19:42.000
He's...

19:43.600 --> 19:44.800
He's...

19:46.400 --> 19:47.400
He's...

19:48.200 --> 19:49.200
He's...

19:51.300 --> 19:52.800
- gone!
- Gone!

19:55.200 --> 19:56.400
Well...

19:56.500 --> 19:59.700
if he's gone, you must have seen him.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.100
No.

20:02.200 --> 20:04.000
Who's the pretty boy?

20:10.900 --> 20:12.100
Shut up!

20:20.100 --> 20:21.500
And what's this?

20:22.500 --> 20:26.400
That's Lord Lambourn's waistcoat.
He's such a kind man.

20:26.500 --> 20:30.400
He thinks of everybody.
He left those here in case you escaped...

20:30.500 --> 20:34.900
- and needed a change of clothing.
- I'm sure I killed the last one I raped.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.600
It can't have been you.

20:37.100 --> 20:40.600
The after-play was a bit on the rough side...

20:40.700 --> 20:42.700
but not fatal, dear.

20:44.100 --> 20:47.300
What's this Dan, or whatever you call him,
look like?

20:47.400 --> 20:50.200
He looks a little bit
like Lord Lambourn, actually.

20:50.400 --> 20:54.000
But a bit more like you.
Much more like you, in fact.

20:56.000 --> 21:00.900
Yellowbeard. A tall, rough man
with a big yellow beard.

21:17.200 --> 21:19.000
That's our agent, sir.

21:21.700 --> 21:23.200
Did you see...

21:25.100 --> 21:29.800
- He's blind, you stupid sod!
- I may be blind...

21:29.800 --> 21:32.100
but I have acute hearing.

21:32.200 --> 21:35.200
I'm not interested in your jewelry,
cloth eyes. I'm trying to conduct...

21:35.300 --> 21:36.700
Yellowbeard...

21:37.500 --> 21:40.100
- was here.
- How do you know it was him?

21:40.100 --> 21:41.900
Because he sounded...

21:42.100 --> 21:44.100
about 47...

21:44.800 --> 21:49.600
and his clothing gave off
the unmistakable fibrous crackling sound...

21:49.700 --> 21:51.900
- of the 80% hessian...
- Which way did he go?

21:51.900 --> 21:55.000
...whilst the deafening
rustling of his beard...

21:55.100 --> 21:59.500
- indicated a length of not...
- Which way did he go?

22:06.800 --> 22:09.100
- Upstairs.
- Come on!

22:16.600 --> 22:19.500
- Where's Yellowbeard?
- He's in prison, isn't he?

22:19.500 --> 22:23.000
Your husband escaped this evening.
We know he came straight here.

22:23.100 --> 22:27.200
Come to think of it,
somebody did come in here a while back...

22:27.300 --> 22:31.200
- but I don't think it was my husband.
- These are his clothes.

22:31.600 --> 22:36.000
Wait a minute.
Somebody did pop in and rape me.

22:36.200 --> 22:39.500
- These must be his clothes.
- That's Yellowbeard, all right.

22:40.300 --> 22:42.600
Prison has reformed him.

22:42.700 --> 22:46.000
He never bothered to take his clothes off
in the old days.

22:46.000 --> 22:49.100
- Where did he go?
- I've no idea.

22:49.200 --> 22:52.300
Right, Mansell. Bring those clothes.
We'll need a scent.

22:53.100 --> 22:55.300
- For the dogs.
- Right.

23:09.500 --> 23:10.800
Yellowbeard?

23:17.300 --> 23:19.800
- Evening, Gilbert.
- Now look here, Pew.

23:19.900 --> 23:23.100
- I'm all ears.
- Those two gentlemen that just left...

23:23.100 --> 23:25.400
you didn't tell them everything you heard,
did you, shipmate?

23:25.400 --> 23:26.700
What gentlemen?

23:26.800 --> 23:28.800
I didn't hear you mention
much about a map.

23:28.900 --> 23:31.700
- What map?
- Yellowbeard's map.

23:32.100 --> 23:36.700
The one that any pirate worth his parrot
would give both his wooden legs for.

23:36.800 --> 23:40.000
You're drunk, Gilbert.
Your mind's wandering.

23:40.100 --> 23:43.000
My hands will be wandering
towards your throat, Pew...

23:43.000 --> 23:45.500
if you don't tell me what it is you overheard.

23:45.500 --> 23:48.500
So you can pass the information
on to Mr. Moon...

23:48.500 --> 23:52.700
so he can find the treasure?
Over my dead body.

23:52.800 --> 23:55.200
Very well, if those are your conditions.

23:55.300 --> 23:58.100
I was hoping we might see this eye to eye.

24:01.400 --> 24:03.500
I'm afraid you've forced my hand.

24:04.200 --> 24:07.000
Listen up, my hearties! Listen.

24:07.100 --> 24:10.400
This dear old blind man here...

24:11.500 --> 24:16.100
is a government agent! It is true.
I saw him talking to those two.

24:16.200 --> 24:17.300
It is a lie!

24:20.300 --> 24:22.400
I only told him one thing...

24:23.400 --> 24:25.500
about a treasure!

24:26.400 --> 24:28.200
- Treasure?
- Bolt that door.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.900
- Bolt that door, lads.
- Draw them curtains.

24:30.900 --> 24:33.500
- Draw them curtains!
- Put them other lights out.

24:33.500 --> 24:35.800
Put them other lights out, lads!

24:49.500 --> 24:53.200
- Where's Yellowbeard?
- Mr. Moon, sir.

24:53.400 --> 24:57.200
I was following him,
and then I thought I was being followed...

24:57.400 --> 25:00.200
- if you follow me.
- Who'd follow you?

25:00.300 --> 25:02.400
Some stupid blind man.

25:02.600 --> 25:06.500
Well, we've got to follow Yellowbeard,
and make sure no one else is following him.

25:06.600 --> 25:08.000
Do you follow me?

25:09.800 --> 25:11.700
What's going on in there?

25:29.300 --> 25:33.500
Evening. Sounded as though
there was a bit of a squabble.

25:34.100 --> 25:35.400
Squabble?

25:35.900 --> 25:37.800
- They're all dead.
- All?

25:38.300 --> 25:40.600
Must have been more of a tiff then.

25:42.600 --> 25:44.400
Squabble, tiff.

25:47.500 --> 25:49.600
Mr. Moon!

25:59.800 --> 26:03.900
I imagine being in the Navy, you must know
quite a lot about the sea and what's in it.

26:03.900 --> 26:06.800
- A trifle.
- A trifle?

26:06.900 --> 26:11.000
Yes, I once had a rum trifle,
but I only drink when I'm working.

26:11.400 --> 26:13.200
- Indeed.
- There you are, Lambourn.

26:13.300 --> 26:16.800
I was wanting your advice
on a matter of etiquetty.

26:16.900 --> 26:19.900
Now, does one curtsey
before saying adieu...

26:20.000 --> 26:23.700
or does one go down while speaking?

26:23.800 --> 26:26.000
Oh, dear. That's tricky.

26:28.000 --> 26:31.500
Excuse me, Admiral.
I must just have a word with this gentleman.

26:32.200 --> 26:35.400
I shan't be a moment. Oh, I say.

26:35.500 --> 26:39.200
Who was that chap who just seized hold
of my wife? Do you know him?

26:39.800 --> 26:41.300
Steady. Steady.

26:43.000 --> 26:46.400
He seems to have taken
quite a shine to Lady L.

26:47.300 --> 26:48.600
Yes.

26:49.500 --> 26:53.200
Not many people do, you know.
But when they do, they do.

26:55.200 --> 26:57.400
And when she does, she does.

27:02.200 --> 27:04.200
- Is your name Dan?
- Yes.

27:04.200 --> 27:07.300
- I need your head, my lad.
- You're my father.

27:07.400 --> 27:09.400
So your mother says,
but that's no reason to believe it.

27:09.500 --> 27:12.400
- Never trust a woman or a government.
- Well, pleased to meet you.

27:12.500 --> 27:15.500
I haven't got time for idle chitchat!
I need your head.

27:15.600 --> 27:17.000
Well, that makes a change.

27:17.100 --> 27:19.500
Mother seems to disapprove
of me using it at all.

27:19.600 --> 27:21.900
You're not gonna use it.
You're gonna lose it, lad.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.800
I'm gonna use it.
Right. Put your neck over there.

27:24.900 --> 27:28.000
- It'll be cleaner that way.
- You want to cut my head off?

27:28.300 --> 27:30.400
- What for?
- I don't want to lug your body...

27:30.500 --> 27:34.600
halfway around the world, do I?
Your head's got a map on it that I need.

27:35.700 --> 27:39.000
Well, you don't need to kill me for it.
Look, why don't you copy it?

27:39.000 --> 27:42.200
What? And have two maps? Bugger off!

27:43.800 --> 27:46.500
Look, if you cut my head off,
it'll start to putrefy.

27:46.500 --> 27:49.600
- Do what?
- Putrefy! Go rotten!

27:49.700 --> 27:52.800
Yeah, it would ooze a lot. Heads do.
But I can live with that.

27:52.900 --> 27:56.100
No, stop! Look! I could help you, Dad.

27:56.100 --> 27:57.100
Everyone will be following you...

27:57.200 --> 27:59.500
- and if they catch you, they'll have the map.
- Bugger them!

27:59.500 --> 28:02.400
I'll eat it first.
Won't be the first head I've eaten.

28:02.500 --> 28:04.000
But then you'll have lost it forever.

28:04.100 --> 28:06.400
Look. Wouldn't it be better
to leave it where it's safe?

28:06.600 --> 28:08.100
What? And take you along?

28:08.200 --> 28:11.100
You're not pirate material!
You wouldn't fit in.

28:12.300 --> 28:15.700
Hello, Dan. Been doing some gardening?

28:16.300 --> 28:19.100
- I don't believe we've been introduced.
- All right, Dan.

28:19.100 --> 28:22.300
If you're my son, prove it.
Kill this stupid old bugger.

28:22.300 --> 28:25.300
- Now hold your horses.
- I can't kill him. He brought me up...

28:25.400 --> 28:26.600
just like a father.

28:26.700 --> 28:29.900
You mean he's beaten you and kicked you
and smashed you in the teeth?

28:29.900 --> 28:30.900
- Yes.
- No!

28:31.000 --> 28:33.600
- No.
- He's been kind and gentle.

28:33.700 --> 28:36.900
- What kind of father is that? Kill him!
- No!

28:37.000 --> 28:40.100
- All right. I'll do it.
- No, don't!

28:40.200 --> 28:41.900
Look, he could be useful.

28:42.000 --> 28:46.100
Yes, I could be useful. I could, I could,
I could. What could I do?

28:48.800 --> 28:51.000
- They followed you here.
- I'll kill them all!

28:51.000 --> 28:53.100
- No, quick hide in here.
- All right.

28:53.200 --> 28:56.700
But I'll kill anyone that gets in the way
of me killing anyone.

28:56.800 --> 28:59.800
We'll take him to Dr. Gilpin's.
He always knows what to do.

28:59.800 --> 29:02.800
- And then kill everybody!
- Whatever you like, Dad.

29:02.900 --> 29:06.800
Dad? Him?
You mean to say I'm not your father?

29:06.900 --> 29:10.500
No. Mother says he is,
but you're still my father to me.

29:10.600 --> 29:14.600
- I'm still my father to you, Son.
- Look, you brought me up.

29:14.700 --> 29:16.800
You're my father. I don't even know him.

29:16.900 --> 29:20.000
- Lambourn!
- I'll come with you, Son.

29:20.600 --> 29:24.200
- This Dr. Gilpin, is he your father?
- No, he's your closest friend.

29:24.300 --> 29:26.300
I look forward to meeting him.

29:26.500 --> 29:29.900
Twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five...

29:39.400 --> 29:40.600
Lady Lambourn.

29:42.400 --> 29:45.700
- Well, he's not even married to her.
- I think he's blind.

29:47.500 --> 29:49.300
Under her command, so to speak.

29:51.700 --> 29:54.300
Now, see here, if you go with him,
you'll be criminals.

29:55.000 --> 29:57.500
You'll never be able to return to England.

29:58.200 --> 30:01.700
But if the government gets the treasure...

30:02.200 --> 30:06.300
they'll only waste it.
Warmongering in Europe.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.300
There we are.

30:13.000 --> 30:16.700
- That looks nothing like me!
- Well, that's the whole idea.

30:18.500 --> 30:22.600
I've got to go with him, my father,
to get the treasure.

30:22.700 --> 30:25.800
- I've got the map of the island.
- Could be very dangerous.

30:25.900 --> 30:27.500
It'll be dangerous. Do the boy good...

30:27.600 --> 30:30.400
to get a bit of senseless violence
into his life.

30:30.500 --> 30:32.500
Will you come with us, too, Doctor?

30:32.600 --> 30:35.900
Why, think of all the new plants
and medicines you could discover.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.400
Yeah. What's this?

30:38.200 --> 30:42.000
Stop! That's a precious extract
from a rare tropical tree.

30:42.200 --> 30:44.800
One drop of it paralyzes a man instantly.

30:50.700 --> 30:52.600
Perhaps it wears off instantly.

30:53.500 --> 30:54.900
No. No.

30:55.700 --> 30:58.700
Possibly ineffective
when taken through the mouth.

30:59.900 --> 31:02.200
Well, of course, if we really were...

31:02.200 --> 31:05.200
going on a botanical expedition...

31:05.600 --> 31:06.700
- They're here.
- Kill!

31:06.800 --> 31:09.000
- There's no need to.
- We must find a name for you.

31:09.100 --> 31:12.000
- Professor...
- Professor Flask.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.700
- Professor Death!
- Professor Chair.

31:13.800 --> 31:15.400
- Professor Rape!
- Professor Clock.

31:15.500 --> 31:17.500
What about Professor Anthrax?

31:17.500 --> 31:19.700
- Yes.
- Anthrax.

31:20.900 --> 31:23.400
Bugger off, you evil git!

31:23.700 --> 31:28.000
Evening, Doctor.
I was just saying good day to Mr. Pew.

31:28.600 --> 31:31.900
Lord Lambourn. And Dan.

31:32.600 --> 31:36.500
- And?
- Yeah, this is Professor Anthrax.

31:36.800 --> 31:40.900
- That's Yellowbeard.
- I'm in disguise, you stupid tart!

31:43.400 --> 31:46.100
- You've met your father then.
- Yes.

31:46.200 --> 31:48.100
We've got some exciting news.

31:48.600 --> 31:51.900
- You're all going after the treasure!
- Treasure? No.

31:52.200 --> 31:54.200
- No.
- Botanical...

31:54.300 --> 31:55.900
Killing plants!

31:56.800 --> 31:58.300
- Chasing butterflies.
- No.

31:58.400 --> 32:00.600
Well, I'm entitled to my share.

32:01.000 --> 32:05.000
What with all the lying and cheating
and tattooing that I've done over the years.

32:05.100 --> 32:09.600
- Don't worry, Mother. You'll get your share.
- I don't ask for much.

32:10.600 --> 32:14.400
I'd just like to see
a few of my little dreams come true.

32:15.700 --> 32:20.000
I've always wanted to buy Denmark
and be richer than the Queen.

32:20.000 --> 32:23.300
Yes, and if you do your job
covering up for us, Mother...

32:23.300 --> 32:25.700
- that will all come true.
- And by the way...

32:26.300 --> 32:29.200
why did you tell me that I was his father?

32:29.700 --> 32:31.000
I didn't.

32:31.400 --> 32:34.900
You were so sure he was,
I didn't have the heart to tell you.

32:35.200 --> 32:36.900
I think...

32:37.000 --> 32:39.500
we'd better sail for Jamaica at once.

32:39.700 --> 32:41.400
We'll find a ship...

32:42.400 --> 32:43.900
at Portsmouth.

32:56.500 --> 32:59.600
I was only taking what's my due
to cover expenses.

32:59.700 --> 33:02.100
You should see the mess they made.

33:02.300 --> 33:04.500
- What happened?
- Plague.

33:05.500 --> 33:07.000
Plague?

33:07.100 --> 33:09.600
All sudden like.

33:09.600 --> 33:11.400
Lucky I was out.

33:12.000 --> 33:15.400
- That man's got a sword in him.
- He fell on it.

33:16.600 --> 33:20.100
- Has Yellowbeard been here?
- He's dead, too.

33:20.500 --> 33:23.600
And Lord Lambourn and Dr. Gilpin.

33:24.400 --> 33:25.800
And my son.

33:25.900 --> 33:28.200
My son, Dan!

33:28.600 --> 33:31.500
All gone, all dead.

33:32.100 --> 33:35.100
- Oh, my!
- Oh, hell.

33:35.200 --> 33:37.300
If they're all dead,
what are you gonna tell the Queen, sir?

33:37.400 --> 33:40.400
I mean, we're supposed
to follow them to the treasure.

33:47.400 --> 33:51.700
- Halt! In the name of the law!
- All right! I'm not deaf!

33:55.500 --> 33:57.900
All right, Pew, what have you heard?

34:05.300 --> 34:08.100
Little did Yellowbeard surmise...

34:08.100 --> 34:12.300
as he presented himself
to his prospective traveling companions...

34:12.400 --> 34:16.100
that the details of the engagements
were being overheard...

34:16.199 --> 34:19.000
by a tall blind man of impressive bearing...

34:19.000 --> 34:21.100
- aquiline features...
- Cut the purple prose, Pew.

34:21.100 --> 34:24.500
Just give us the facts.
Where's Yellowbeard gone?

34:29.400 --> 34:31.500
- Portsmouth.
- With whom?

34:31.500 --> 34:33.199
Three people.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.400
Lambourn.

34:38.199 --> 34:39.400
Dan.

34:41.500 --> 34:43.199
Dr. Gilpin.

34:44.000 --> 34:46.699
Right, Mansell.
We shall be needing that frigate.

34:50.800 --> 34:53.600
Come on, Mansell.
We'll be needing Mrs. Beard.

34:53.900 --> 34:57.800
I think a month or two at sea
will loosen Mrs. Beard's tongue.

34:58.300 --> 35:00.100
Is she going away, too, sir?

35:25.000 --> 35:26.300
That'll do him.

35:36.000 --> 35:38.700
How's that for a squabble, Pew?

35:47.600 --> 35:49.400
Here! Stop! Thief!

35:53.800 --> 35:55.300
Fresh flowers!

35:56.300 --> 35:58.000
Get your lucky heather!

35:59.300 --> 36:01.200
Yoo-hoo, fresh flowers, sir?

36:03.900 --> 36:04.900
Yes.

36:08.600 --> 36:11.600
Fresh heather! Fresh flowers!

36:20.100 --> 36:23.800
I've always been fascinated by the sea.
It's so big.

36:23.900 --> 36:25.700
It has the little...

36:49.400 --> 36:52.100
It's the mouth of the river port, isn't it?

37:06.500 --> 37:08.100
Oh, my God!

37:11.500 --> 37:12.500
Come on.

37:18.000 --> 37:20.900
Harden your knives here.
Sharpen your knives.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.400
Can I have three farthings
for a lump of shit, please?

37:23.400 --> 37:24.400
I beg your pardon?

37:24.500 --> 37:27.000
I said can I have three farthings
for a lump of shit?

37:27.100 --> 37:28.300
No.

37:30.500 --> 37:32.100
Society's to blame.

37:34.700 --> 37:37.800
Harden your knives here.
Sharpen your knives.

37:38.900 --> 37:40.600
Excuse me a moment.

37:41.400 --> 37:45.000
Look out! Press gang! Get out! Press gang.

37:46.400 --> 37:48.700
- Get him. Come on.
- Catch him over there.

37:49.100 --> 37:50.400
Come on, get him!

37:52.800 --> 37:54.800
- That's the stuff.
- Press gang?

37:54.900 --> 37:58.700
Yes, they persuade drunks and vagrants
to become sailors.

37:59.200 --> 38:02.600
- What happens when they sober up?
- They're at sea.

38:02.600 --> 38:05.700
Okay, get that one in there!
Shove him in good, please.

38:06.400 --> 38:09.700
All right, good. He was a bit thin.
Those ones over there, they look good.

38:13.400 --> 38:14.600
I say.

38:15.900 --> 38:18.600
I'll give you three farthings, young lady.

38:19.900 --> 38:22.400
There we are. Oopsy daisy.

38:24.000 --> 38:27.000
A good big one
will always beat a rotten little one.

38:32.200 --> 38:35.900
What's going on, hey?
What do you think you're doing?

38:39.000 --> 38:41.200
Just borrowing your jacket, Bosun.

38:52.600 --> 38:57.500
I say, sir. I just saw two naval gentlemen
going the other way.

38:57.600 --> 39:01.500
Where's Yellowbeard? Professor Anthrax.

39:01.500 --> 39:05.000
He can't be far. He'll find us.
He needs that map.

39:05.100 --> 39:07.700
Well, I hope he finds us
before they find him.

39:07.800 --> 39:09.900
And it's not long before we sail.

39:10.600 --> 39:14.200
Now, we know it's an island close
to Jamaica, and we've got the map of it.

39:14.300 --> 39:18.500
But without him to tell us which island,
we might as well go home.

39:21.100 --> 39:25.500
Now, I'm sure some of you gentlemen
would like to volunteer...

39:25.700 --> 39:30.300
for a well-paid, well-fed adventure holiday...

39:31.000 --> 39:32.900
such as youths dream of...

39:33.000 --> 39:36.000
upon a modern, rat-free, leak-proof ship!

39:36.900 --> 39:40.900
Any volunteers just lie down on the ground
with your eyes shut.

39:43.400 --> 39:45.500
Would you gentlemen be looking for a ship?

39:45.600 --> 39:46.800
- We...
- Well, as a matter of fact...

39:46.900 --> 39:50.000
we're lucky enough already
to have tickets for the...

40:03.000 --> 40:04.200
Load them on.

40:06.600 --> 40:08.200
Take them to the ship.

40:16.400 --> 40:19.600
- Come on, kick him out! Come on!
- Oh, my God!

40:19.700 --> 40:21.800
He's thrown her in the water tub!

40:29.800 --> 40:32.600
- Take your hands off of me!
- Shut up and move!

40:35.400 --> 40:37.900
I want these three shackled in the bilges.

40:38.700 --> 40:40.000
Move over!

40:41.600 --> 40:42.800
Come on, old man.

40:42.900 --> 40:46.400
There's no need.
We can make our own way there.

40:48.800 --> 40:51.500
Sign here. I'll make your mark.

40:55.200 --> 40:58.100
- There's your shilling.
- Thank you, sir!

41:00.300 --> 41:03.000
Don't do that. Don't do that ever again.

41:07.500 --> 41:11.300
- Get off, lad.
- All right. Come on, move it.

41:11.400 --> 41:14.200
I never noticed that hook
when he signed on.

41:14.400 --> 41:15.800
Nor did I, sir.

41:17.000 --> 41:21.100
- He's right-handed, sir.
- Get rid of the others.

41:30.200 --> 41:31.400
Quiet!

41:40.500 --> 41:42.800
- Mr. Crisp.
- Aye, sir!

41:43.700 --> 41:45.100
What is that?

41:45.600 --> 41:49.800
- That's my box, sir.
- No, carrying your box.

41:50.900 --> 41:52.700
Cabin boy Smith, sir.

41:54.100 --> 41:57.700
- Smith has tits.
- He's been a bit ill, sir.

41:57.800 --> 41:59.200
Get her off!

42:00.300 --> 42:01.200
Aye, sir.

42:04.500 --> 42:06.000
Wait a minute.

42:06.800 --> 42:08.200
What is that?

42:09.000 --> 42:12.300
It's a crocodile, sir.

42:12.900 --> 42:14.300
What's it for?

42:14.400 --> 42:17.200
Well, each sailor is...

42:17.300 --> 42:20.600
allowed, by tradition, a pet, sir.

42:20.700 --> 42:24.200
One pet per sailor, parrots preferred.

42:25.300 --> 42:29.700
Well, we like clubbed together, as it were,
if you take my drift, sir.

42:29.800 --> 42:33.800
- That's bigger than three parrots.
- Not if they're in cages, sir.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.300
Open it up.

42:37.400 --> 42:38.600
Open it up?

42:38.700 --> 42:41.600
Open it up!
There are buttons down the side.

42:47.900 --> 42:51.800
The ancient superstition
that a woman onboard brings bad luck...

42:51.900 --> 42:54.700
is now a proven scientific fact.

42:56.800 --> 42:58.500
Nice try, Rosie.

43:05.300 --> 43:08.800
Shouldn't bother, love.
They're fairly strict on this one.

43:50.400 --> 43:52.200
<i>Rattus vulgaris.</i>

43:53.700 --> 43:55.800
- Yeah.
- You know, I've been thinking.

43:55.900 --> 43:59.100
If we paid 300 guineas each for this cabin...

43:59.200 --> 44:01.700
I'm glad we didn't go for the cheaper ones.

44:02.400 --> 44:06.200
I'm sorry to interrupt
your morning bath, gentlemen.

44:06.800 --> 44:08.800
On your knees!

44:09.100 --> 44:12.800
And crawl up here on the double!
Up here on the double!

44:15.200 --> 44:19.800
- All hands present, Mr. Crisp, sir!
- Thank you, Bosun!

44:20.800 --> 44:25.000
Deliver me, O Lord, from the evil man,
preserve me from the violent man...

44:41.600 --> 44:43.800
My name is Captain Hughes.

44:44.800 --> 44:49.300
These are my officers, Lieutenant Martin,
who is responsible for discipline...

44:50.100 --> 44:53.400
Lieutenant Crisp,
who is responsible for discipline...

44:54.600 --> 44:57.700
Mr. Prostitute, who is responsible for...

44:59.600 --> 45:01.900
Nail that man's foot to the deck.

45:02.000 --> 45:03.300
- Aye, sir.
- Discipline.

45:03.400 --> 45:07.300
No, I... It's all right. No. I was just joking.

45:07.300 --> 45:10.200
I was just having a...
Here, hang on. Hey, wait a minute.

45:15.900 --> 45:19.200
Now, in fairness to all of you...

45:20.100 --> 45:22.800
I'm honor bound to ask this question.

45:24.200 --> 45:28.800
Is there anyone here who does not wish
to be a member of Her Majesty's Navy?

45:31.000 --> 45:32.300
Me, sir.

45:39.100 --> 45:42.300
Is there anyone else
who is reluctant to serve?

45:46.400 --> 45:47.400
Right.

45:48.300 --> 45:52.100
lf, by chance, some of you may feel
that the discipline on this ship...

45:52.200 --> 45:56.200
is a trifle on the harsh side of strict...

45:56.800 --> 46:00.900
let me remind you that it is our duty
to seek out and destroy...

46:01.000 --> 46:02.600
Her Majesty's enemies...

46:02.700 --> 46:04.000
the foul...

46:04.100 --> 46:07.300
and most foreign French.

46:08.000 --> 46:09.200
- Here, here.
- Now...

46:09.300 --> 46:13.100
while the rest of the world will
eventually arrive at the same conclusion...

46:13.100 --> 46:15.700
it is our urgent task...

46:16.700 --> 46:19.600
to push things on a little.

46:20.200 --> 46:21.300
Amen.

46:25.400 --> 46:26.500
Next.

46:28.400 --> 46:31.500
Mr. Martin, Mr. Prostitute...

46:32.200 --> 46:33.700
luncheon duty.

46:46.500 --> 46:49.100
Right, Mr. Beamish,
I'll see the prisoner now.

46:49.300 --> 46:50.500
Aye, aye, sir.

46:50.500 --> 46:52.200
Man the capstan.

46:59.700 --> 47:02.700
- Ready to talk yet, Mrs. Beard?
- No!

47:03.200 --> 47:05.700
- Take her away, Mr. Beamish.
- Aye, aye, sir.

47:05.700 --> 47:06.700
Down.

47:19.000 --> 47:22.000
Give them a taste of the lash
before they've done anything.

47:22.100 --> 47:25.600
- Preventive punishment, that's the principle.
- Yes, sir.

47:27.400 --> 47:29.900
That man yawned.
Give him a swimming lesson.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.100
What, what? Hey! No.
Come on, wait a minute!

47:32.200 --> 47:33.800
Wait a minute. No. Hey!

47:35.600 --> 47:36.600
Thanks.

47:37.600 --> 47:39.800
- Well done, sir.
- Hold the line.

47:46.100 --> 47:47.400
Lovely day.

48:33.600 --> 48:35.500
No! No!

48:35.500 --> 48:36.500
No!

48:36.600 --> 48:37.800
Oh, no!

48:40.100 --> 48:41.600
Oh, no!

48:41.700 --> 48:44.000
Oh, what have we here? A laggard?

48:48.500 --> 48:52.100
Oh, it's so hard on a manicure, isn't it?

48:53.500 --> 48:55.200
Not to worry, lad.

48:55.300 --> 48:57.300
You'll get the hang of it.

49:05.800 --> 49:07.800
And third, Your Majesty...

49:09.000 --> 49:11.000
I'm very pleased to report...

49:11.700 --> 49:13.900
that after several very brave...

49:14.400 --> 49:17.100
and very expensive battles...

49:17.900 --> 49:19.900
the pirate Yellowbeard...

49:20.800 --> 49:23.300
is now well and truly...

49:23.500 --> 49:25.400
in our grasp.

49:30.000 --> 49:33.500
Sir, is that, strictly speaking, accurate, sir?

49:33.900 --> 49:37.900
Mansell, that's what
we in the Royal Navy call a lie.

49:38.600 --> 49:40.900
A lie, sir? But that's treason, isn't it?

49:40.900 --> 49:42.400
- Be quiet.
- Yes, sir.

49:42.500 --> 49:45.600
- Now get that off to Her Majesty right away.
- Yes, sir.

49:49.500 --> 49:50.800
How, sir?

49:51.400 --> 49:53.200
By pigeon, Mansell.

49:54.500 --> 49:55.500
Pigeon, sir?

49:55.600 --> 49:59.100
Surely you didn't forget
to bring the pigeon, Mansell?

50:12.600 --> 50:13.700
Come in.

50:18.600 --> 50:21.600
- I think she might be ready to talk now, sir.
- Right.

50:23.300 --> 50:27.200
I seem to remember something
about an island.

50:28.400 --> 50:33.100
It must have been that shark
what jogged my memory.

50:34.000 --> 50:35.500
Jolly good, Ensign.

50:36.800 --> 50:38.800
- Thank you, sir.
- Well done.

50:39.900 --> 50:42.300
Shall I meet you in the pump room, sir?

50:44.900 --> 50:46.400
Sit down, Mrs. Beard.

50:46.600 --> 50:48.400
Now, about this island.

50:49.500 --> 50:51.300
A little pigeon, perhaps?

50:52.100 --> 50:54.600
I've just ate some tuna, thank you.

51:00.900 --> 51:03.200
Where did I put that treasure?

51:03.400 --> 51:06.000
No, it's stagger. No, no, no.

51:07.000 --> 51:09.700
Get shot, then fall...

51:09.800 --> 51:11.600
then crawl, crawl...

51:11.600 --> 51:13.600
then stagger, stagger.

51:18.500 --> 51:21.000
Do you know that you have
three paying passengers onboard...

51:21.100 --> 51:23.800
who are being treated
as abominably as the rest of the crew?

51:23.900 --> 51:24.900
Really?

51:25.800 --> 51:29.800
I think once the Captain realizes who we are,
we'll get an easier passage.

51:31.500 --> 51:33.000
Perfect. Let's go.

51:33.500 --> 51:36.500
Well, I can see
there's only one thing you'll understand.

51:36.500 --> 51:38.900
And what, pray, might that be?

51:41.300 --> 51:43.700
Right! Let's finish it!

51:56.500 --> 52:00.100
- I'm so sorry, sir.
- What for?

52:01.500 --> 52:03.100
Interrupting you, sir.

52:03.800 --> 52:05.800
I was only smoking a cigar.

52:06.600 --> 52:07.800
Yes, sir.

52:08.300 --> 52:12.600
I came to tell you that the son of
Yellowbeard the pirate is onboard this ship.

52:12.700 --> 52:15.100
The son of Yellowbeard the pirate?

52:18.500 --> 52:19.600
Who's that?

52:21.400 --> 52:23.400
That was Mr. Crisp, sir.

52:24.200 --> 52:25.400
Mr. Crisp?

52:31.000 --> 52:34.700
Officers and men of <i>The Lady Edith...</i>

52:35.100 --> 52:39.600
these three people posing as pressees,
are, in fact...

52:39.800 --> 52:41.500
foul stowaways.

52:41.900 --> 52:43.500
Stowaways? No!

52:43.600 --> 52:45.200
The perspicacity of Mr. Moon...

52:45.200 --> 52:49.900
has led to the discovery
of a conspiracy against the Crown.

52:50.300 --> 52:53.200
There's no doubt in my mind
that the one in the middle...

52:53.200 --> 52:56.700
is the son of the evil Yellowbeard.

52:56.800 --> 52:59.600
- Yellowbeard!
- He has already dispatched...

52:59.900 --> 53:02.800
dear Mr. Crisp to the deep...

53:03.300 --> 53:06.200
clearly with the purpose
of taking over this vessel.

53:07.500 --> 53:12.000
We shall deliver
these traitors to the proper authorities.

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
Set course for Portsmouth.

53:15.800 --> 53:17.900
You know what to do, Mr. Moon.

53:36.500 --> 53:37.700
Mutiny.

53:55.100 --> 53:58.400
Oh, dear, the Captain
would appear to be out of sorts!

54:04.500 --> 54:08.400
We're gonna have to choose a new captain.
Who shall it be?

54:08.900 --> 54:09.900
Me!

54:11.200 --> 54:14.600
- No. We want Dan!
- Dan?

54:15.600 --> 54:16.900
Or the prostitute.

54:21.500 --> 54:23.200
Dan.

54:23.300 --> 54:25.000
Who? Who? Come on!

54:25.000 --> 54:27.500
- Dan! Dan!
- Dan!

54:27.700 --> 54:29.100
- We want Dan!
- Dan!

54:34.400 --> 54:36.000
It's unanimous, then.

54:36.800 --> 54:38.800
The ship's yours, Captain...

54:39.100 --> 54:41.200
to take where you will.

54:48.300 --> 54:49.800
That's it, that's it.

54:52.800 --> 54:56.200
I hope you don't mind us
tying up the Captain like that, sir.

54:56.300 --> 54:57.800
No, not at all.

54:57.800 --> 55:00.200
Well, I was only following your lead.

55:00.500 --> 55:04.700
I mean, well, your killing Mr. Crisp
was an example to us all.

55:05.200 --> 55:09.000
But I only hit him with a bucket,
and then everything went blank.

55:09.500 --> 55:10.500
Oh, yeah.

55:10.700 --> 55:12.700
It's like that, killing.

55:15.100 --> 55:17.100
No hard feelings, Captain Hughes.

55:17.100 --> 55:19.700
Your consideration will be noted.

55:19.800 --> 55:23.200
Now, Bosun, set course for Madagascar.

55:27.200 --> 55:28.200
Yes.

55:29.200 --> 55:30.400
Right!

55:31.300 --> 55:33.600
You heard what the Captain said.

55:34.300 --> 55:37.200
- It's Madagascar.
- Aye, aye, sir.

55:42.900 --> 55:45.000
Set a course for Portsmouth, Mr. Martin.

55:45.100 --> 55:46.200
Aye, aye, sir!

55:46.300 --> 55:48.600
East by northeast, Mr. Prostitute.

55:48.700 --> 55:50.200
Aye, aye, sir.

56:10.400 --> 56:14.600
All's well!

56:54.300 --> 56:58.400
- Ah...
- S'well!

57:22.200 --> 57:25.300
We went 10 degrees west
off course overnight.

57:25.800 --> 57:27.500
Did you notice that, Mr. Moon?

57:27.600 --> 57:29.200
Indeed I did, sir.

57:29.800 --> 57:33.400
Our captain didn't bump
the helmsman off last night, did he?

57:33.500 --> 57:36.700
No. Didn't leave his cabin, Mr. Moon.

57:37.600 --> 57:40.100
- Did you order a change of course?
- No.

57:44.000 --> 57:47.000
I think someone knows where the island is.

57:48.800 --> 57:51.500
See? They're leading us right to it.

57:58.000 --> 58:00.800
Come on, Mrs. Beard.
We've been at this all day.

58:02.000 --> 58:04.300
No. No.

58:05.300 --> 58:07.500
That still doesn't look right.

58:08.000 --> 58:11.600
I don't think you're being as helpful
as you promised, Mrs. Beard.

58:11.700 --> 58:13.600
I'm doing my best.

58:14.500 --> 58:17.200
Perhaps a little more shark treatment?

58:21.300 --> 58:24.500
Nothing in sight, sir.
Absolutely nothing at all.

58:24.700 --> 58:25.900
Nothing, sir!

58:26.300 --> 58:28.600
Talk about clear horizons, this is it.

58:29.100 --> 58:32.200
We've been at sea for weeks without
sighting anything, let alone <i>The Edith.</i>

58:32.300 --> 58:34.000
Ship ahoy!

58:37.900 --> 58:40.000
Look lively, lads. Look lively.

58:45.200 --> 58:47.400
There you are, sir. Nothing again.

58:47.900 --> 58:49.500
Nothing whatsoever.

58:54.300 --> 58:55.800
Behind you, Mansell.

58:55.900 --> 58:57.400
I know you are, sir.

58:57.600 --> 58:59.500
There's a ship behind you.

59:01.700 --> 59:03.900
Good lord, sir! It's <i>The Edith!</i>

59:04.500 --> 59:05.500
Sir?

59:11.900 --> 59:14.000
Of course it's <i>The Edith,</i> Mansell.

59:14.600 --> 59:15.700
But, sir...

59:17.100 --> 59:20.100
it is behind us,
and we're supposed to be following it, sir.

59:20.100 --> 59:22.000
Well, how can we be, sir?

59:27.500 --> 59:30.000
- Strike the colors, Mr. Beamish.
- Strike the colors, Mr. Beamish.

59:30.100 --> 59:31.900
- Hoist the French flag.
- Hoist the French flag.

59:32.000 --> 59:33.900
- Hard about.
- Hard about.

59:34.300 --> 59:35.900
They mustn't know
we're after them, Mansell.

59:36.000 --> 59:38.000
If we can convince them we're French,
they'll avoid us.

59:38.100 --> 59:41.200
Perhaps then we can return
to following them discreetly.

59:43.100 --> 59:44.600
What sort of ship is it?

59:44.600 --> 59:46.300
Some kind of frigate.

59:47.800 --> 59:51.000
We wouldn't have come across it,
if we had kept our course.

59:51.600 --> 59:53.200
No, no. We wouldn't.

59:56.600 --> 01:00:00.000
There's a flag.
They're French, and they're rounding on us!

01:00:00.100 --> 01:00:01.700
Stand by to fire.

01:00:01.700 --> 01:00:03.000
Oh, dear.

01:00:03.500 --> 01:00:05.200
Stand by to hide.

01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:11.900
All right, Mansell,
so we'll just sail quietly past, all right?

01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:12.900
Aye, aye, sir.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.500
Ready? Fire!

01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:26.600
- Are you all right, Mansell?
- Yes, thank you, sir.

01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:27.800
Shit.

01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:29.600
What do the fools think they're doing?

01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:32.800
We outgun them. We outman them.
We're much faster than they are.

01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:35.700
I think it might have something to do
with the French flag we're flying, sir.

01:00:35.800 --> 01:00:39.700
All right, then to avoid suspicion,
we better appear to retaliate.

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:41.900
We'll fire a bit and miss a lot.

01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:43.100
Fire!

01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:51.700
Lower the guns!

01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:55.000
Fire!

01:00:57.500 --> 01:00:59.000
Raise the guns!

01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:01.600
Fire!

01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:25.800
More sail!

01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:27.400
More sail!

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:38.600
- Clear the debris!
- Clear the debris!

01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:41.600
- Carpenters to action!
- Carpenters to action!

01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:44.200
Jettison some ballast, Mr. McKenzie.

01:01:44.300 --> 01:01:47.600
We must sail as fast as we can
without our sail.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:51.300
Well done, lad!

01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:53.300
This calls for a celebration.

01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:55.500
Well done, Captain.

01:01:56.200 --> 01:01:57.200
Oh, yes.

01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:00.100
No disrespect intended, Your Lordship.

01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:42.200
Straight back, head up and thrust.

01:02:42.900 --> 01:02:44.300
Well done, Son.

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:48.200
- Straight back, head up and thrust.
- Captain.

01:02:58.100 --> 01:02:59.800
Get out, you coward.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.200
- Ebenezer.
- Yes, Percy?

01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:12.400
- I've been thinking.
- Oh, yes?

01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:15.200
Can brandy make you see things?

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:19.900
- lf you drink enough of it.
- Oh, that explains it.

01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:24.400
- That island I thought I saw.
- Island?

01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:28.300
- It is an island.
- Of course.

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:29.700
It's beautiful.

01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:46.000
- Prepare the longboat, Mr. Tarbuck.
- Aye, aye, sir.

01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:50.700
Now, men, a group of us are going
to put ashore here for provisions.

01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:54.600
Provisions. Oh, yes. Of course, sir.

01:03:58.100 --> 01:04:02.500
Could be a mirage.
Looks rather like a mirage I once saw.

01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:03.700
If I saw it.

01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:05.800
Is it anything like the map on my head?

01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:07.900
This is the island.

01:04:54.300 --> 01:04:58.300
I gladly moisten your foot with my nostrils,
Your Barbarity.

01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:04.900
I have something very nice to show you.

01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:06.200
Excellent.

01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:23.400
So, explain to me, <i>Senor</i> Verdugo...

01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:27.000
the intricacies of this
most holy instrument of confession.

01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:30.200
Triola, I don't think you should see this,
my daughter.

01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:33.800
- It's only another torture machine.
- I want it to be a surprise for you.

01:05:33.800 --> 01:05:36.400
- Later, my sweet.
- All right, Daddy.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:39.500
- So, my new confessional.
- Yes, of course.

01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:44.000
But first, Your Severity,
you will notice that the instrument...

01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:47.800
is completely surrounded
by this pool of acid...

01:05:47.900 --> 01:05:51.200
which will destroy anything thrown into it...

01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:54.700
except gold and precious stones.

01:05:54.900 --> 01:05:57.900
But flesh and bone and iron...

01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.300
Observe.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.100
Voil√†!

01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:14.400
And it doesn't dissolve gold, you say?

01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:18.600
No. Not, of course.
Of course not, Your Vapidity.

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:23.100
Even if they have swallowed their valuables,
Your Severity...

01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:27.900
there would be no need for
those messy searches that we used to have.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.600
Unless we want one.

01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:32.000
Of course, Your Outrageousness.

01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:41.200
So this is my new confessional?

01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:45.500
Yes, it is. It works this way, Your Ferocity.
If you will, please.

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:48.000
The prisoner...

01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:50.400
is totally restrained...

01:06:50.600 --> 01:06:53.500
by means of this iron banding.

01:06:53.700 --> 01:06:55.500
Excellent. Excellent.

01:06:56.100 --> 01:07:00.300
But there is more to it than that,
Your Blizzard of the Wrong.

01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:03.600
By means of these ratchets
and these screws...

01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:07.100
you can place his body
in any position that you want...

01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:11.400
for as long as you want
and do anything to it that you want.

01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:15.500
You can break every bone in his hand...

01:07:15.500 --> 01:07:17.500
one at a time.

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:19.300
- And feet?
- And the feet.

01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:21.400
I love it.

01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:23.500
- And the back?
- And the back.

01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:27.500
- And slowly crush them and break them?
- Oh, yes.

01:07:28.100 --> 01:07:31.300
It is very effective,
Your Acute Horrendousness.

01:07:31.700 --> 01:07:35.100
People will be even more frightened of me
when they hear I have this.

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:38.800
Oh, yes, definitely, Your Blind Stupidity.

01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:42.900
Even you, <i>Senor</i> Verdugo?

01:07:44.300 --> 01:07:46.400
Well, of course not me.

01:07:46.500 --> 01:07:50.600
I mean, after all, I made it. I designed it.
It's my baby.

01:07:51.300 --> 01:07:53.300
Well, let's see if it works.

01:07:56.400 --> 01:08:00.100
If it does not work,
I shall dispatch you with heavenly force.

01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:15.900
Well, we could all do
with some good food and clean water.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.899
- Mr. Moon, prepare a hunting party.
- Aye, aye, sir.

01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:21.700
Why don't you go ahead and forage...

01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:25.600
and me and a few of the lads'll stay behind
and guard the boat?

01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:27.800
Very good, Mr. Moon.

01:08:37.899 --> 01:08:42.100
There's a beach like this, which ought to be
on the other side of the island.

01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:46.300
We'll cover more ground if we separate.

01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:50.600
We'll have every gun on that ship ready
for them when they return.

01:08:51.300 --> 01:08:52.800
Bosun Gilbert.

01:08:54.300 --> 01:08:57.200
Aye, aye, Captain Moon.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.700
Bloody murderers.

01:10:58.700 --> 01:11:00.400
Unhand me, you heathens.

01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:08.100
Percy...

01:11:08.300 --> 01:11:11.800
I think I found the tree that
that paralyzing liquid comes from.

01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:14.900
Just stab some under the skin and...

01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:17.600
You do what?

01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:19.700
Stab some...

01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:22.000
Oh, that.

01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:32.100
They've captured Dan.

01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:33.900
Ebenezer, look.

01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:35.400
Who?

01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:38.000
Shall we send for reinforcements...

01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:40.100
or capture them now?

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:45.800
Wait a minute.

01:11:46.700 --> 01:11:48.200
What's that?

01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.300
Good Lord.

01:11:56.700 --> 01:11:58.300
How did he get here?

01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:00.100
There's our reinforcement.

01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:13.100
Seems to have taken a mild dislike
to the priests.

01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:44.500
Come on, men. Let's rescue Captain Dan.

01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:46.600
Not likely, mate.

01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:48.000
And the treasure.

01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:50.800
- Right you are, mate.
- Be right with you.

01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:55.000
- No, no, I can't. Leave me alone.
- Come on, come on, please.

01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:56.900
He'll come back. He'll kill you. You see?

01:12:57.800 --> 01:12:59.400
Your Assholiness.

01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:06.200
Greetings, Your Vehemence.

01:13:08.700 --> 01:13:09.900
Mission accomplished.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.400
By the grace of God and heavenly force...

01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:15.400
five heathen souls
have attained eternal serenity.

01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:18.000
Only five?

01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:20.800
Was there any money?

01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:23.300
On the paltry side, Your Barbarity.

01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:28.500
So your mission was as so much fart gas.

01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:31.100
Oh, no, Your Offensiveness.

01:13:31.100 --> 01:13:33.900
The ship that they came on
was after Yellowbeard's treasure.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.300
Yellowbeard?

01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:37.000
Oh, no, no. He is not here.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:39.100
Just the men
who came looking for his treasure.

01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:41.900
This is one of their officers,
Your Molestation.

01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:44.500
The treasure of Yellowbeard.

01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:46.300
Now I am the richest...

01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:49.900
You must find out everything he knows.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:51.800
I have just the thing.

01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:09.800
Oh, my head.

01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:12.900
And my foot and my back.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.400
<i>Mon Dieu,</i> it works.

01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:17.100
You may torture me,
but it will avail you nothing.

01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:19.500
We'll see about that, sailor.

01:14:37.500 --> 01:14:42.100
Captain Moon, sir, they've captured Dan,
and they're setting a trap for the others.

01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:43.700
Excellent.

01:14:44.100 --> 01:14:47.900
They're making it easy for us.
Well done, Gilbert.

01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:06.600
Is it too cold for you?

01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:08.900
No, I'm all right.

01:15:09.700 --> 01:15:13.800
You must tell my father
where the treasure is, or you will surely die.

01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:15.300
I'll tell him nothing.

01:15:15.300 --> 01:15:18.500
But he only wants it
for the grace and glory of God.

01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:21.800
What kind of God is it
that kills and tortures men?

01:15:21.900 --> 01:15:24.300
My father's only purpose
is to enable heathen souls...

01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:27.900
to enter heaven more rapidly
than they would of their own accord.

01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:29.900
Please tell him.

01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:32.300
It hurts me to see you hurt.

01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:35.800
It hurts me to see you be hurt
by me being hurt.

01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:38.700
I think I love you.

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:40.300
You're right, you do.

01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:42.000
And I love you.

01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:45.500
And when I am rescued,
I want you to come with me.

01:15:45.800 --> 01:15:48.500
But to come with you
would mean leaving here.

01:15:49.900 --> 01:15:52.500
- Are you taking the treasure?
- That's right.

01:15:54.700 --> 01:15:57.000
Triola, you realize your father may be killed?

01:15:57.100 --> 01:16:00.100
Oh, Daddy won't mind.
He's a bit odd about things like that.

01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:02.000
I must pack my things.

01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:20.800
Excuse me, Your Monstrosity.

01:16:21.300 --> 01:16:24.000
Our prisoner here must be very <i>importante.</i>

01:16:24.300 --> 01:16:27.600
There seems to be
quite a little army gathering down there.

01:16:29.100 --> 01:16:32.000
- Could it be their leader?
- No.

01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:35.200
But there is a man
of very high rank giving orders.

01:16:35.300 --> 01:16:37.700
He would know where the treasure is.

01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:40.000
He is the one we must capture.

01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:44.200
That would be very difficult, O Berserk One.

01:16:44.300 --> 01:16:47.900
He would be the last in the attack
and the first to escape.

01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:50.300
Typical leader for you.

01:16:51.400 --> 01:16:52.900
What did you say?

01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:55.900
I said, except for you,
O Mindless Slaughterer.

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.100
That's the answer. Yeah.

01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:09.200
We will lure their leader to the front
by allowing their attack to succeed.

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:10.500
Yes.

01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:15.200
We will pretend to resist
and fake injury and death when they attack.

01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:20.800
Excuse me,
why are you banging your head like that?

01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:24.700
- Was I?
- Yes, you was.

01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:27.700
We all seen you, you silly man.

01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:29.200
Excuse me.

01:17:29.300 --> 01:17:34.300
Yes, and when the invaders reach
the throne room, my men will rise up...

01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:38.300
and dispatch all
with majestic heavenly force.

01:17:39.700 --> 01:17:42.200
Magnificent strategy, Your Arrogance.

01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:44.700
But it must look realistic.

01:17:44.900 --> 01:17:47.000
Anyone caught overacting...

01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:50.000
I will personally scare to death.

01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:54.100
- Alms for the poor.
- Social parasite.

01:17:54.700 --> 01:17:55.800
Take the donkey.

01:17:55.900 --> 01:17:57.500
- My bowl. Where is my bowl?
- Come on, burro!

01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:02.800
Hold on, men.

01:18:04.300 --> 01:18:05.600
This way.

01:18:06.900 --> 01:18:08.700
Welcome to our trap.

01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:15.000
Come on, Ebenezer.

01:18:17.700 --> 01:18:20.900
Now everyone wait for my signal.
Oh, except you.

01:18:56.700 --> 01:18:58.300
That is pathetic!

01:19:03.100 --> 01:19:05.200
- What?
- What about this, sir?

01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:11.000
Go back to your position. Go on!

01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:15.100
So far, so good.

01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:17.800
This way, men.

01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:39.100
Vasquez, don't overdo it.

01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:45.800
- Alms for the poor.
- On guard.

01:19:47.900 --> 01:19:49.100
And you.

01:19:51.700 --> 01:19:53.000
Jolly good.

01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:55.900
Touch√©.

01:20:07.100 --> 01:20:08.400
Good shot.

01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:17.800
Look at this, sir.

01:20:24.300 --> 01:20:25.900
This is terrible!

01:20:26.800 --> 01:20:29.800
I will have no more bad acting!

01:20:58.300 --> 01:21:00.200
- That was great. Bravo.
- Cool.

01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:01.900
Bravo.

01:21:06.500 --> 01:21:08.400
What do you make of it?

01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:15.800
Dead. Entirely.

01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:22.000
Release that man.

01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:25.200
You have fallen for
one of my least likely plans.

01:21:28.200 --> 01:21:30.700
Stand up, men. Come on, you guys.

01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:33.600
- Up. Up.
- I administered a drop of this to them all...

01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:35.600
just as a precaution.

01:21:36.300 --> 01:21:40.300
Well, then, you give me no choice.
I shall have to... I shall have to...

01:21:40.300 --> 01:21:41.600
give up completely.

01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:44.100
Sorry about that. Sorry, sorry, everyone.

01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:46.800
I'll go free your friend, then, shall I?

01:21:51.500 --> 01:21:55.300
I'm much too fiendish
for the likes of you white-faced persons.

01:21:55.300 --> 01:21:58.400
Your friend, who you value so highly,
is in my power.

01:21:58.500 --> 01:22:00.900
- Well, what sort of power?
- What?

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:04.000
Well, what sort of power do you have?

01:22:03.900 --> 01:22:06.400
My divine right
to command over life and death.

01:22:06.500 --> 01:22:09.600
- That sort of power.
- That sort of power, yes.

01:22:09.700 --> 01:22:13.100
I thought perhaps
you meant mechanical energy.

01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:16.400
As ruler,
my supremacy is absolute on this island.

01:22:16.900 --> 01:22:19.600
I thought this was an atoll.

01:22:19.700 --> 01:22:23.000
- Not at all. Not an atoll.
- No, not an atoll? Oh, no. What is it, then?

01:22:23.100 --> 01:22:25.600
- This is an isthmus.
- Isthmus.

01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:28.400
Silence and obey, or I shall kill your captain.

01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:31.900
Yellowbeard.

01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:38.100
Father, we thought you were dead.

01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:41.500
Us Yellowbeards are never more dangerous
than when we're dead.

01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:43.800
How you getting on pirating?

01:22:44.300 --> 01:22:47.300
- Well...
- How many men have you killed so far?

01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:49.400
One. Two, I think.

01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:53.000
You think? You'll never kill anyone
if you go around thinking.

01:22:54.700 --> 01:22:55.900
Triola.

01:22:57.600 --> 01:22:59.300
I don't think you've met my father.

01:22:59.300 --> 01:23:02.700
Been out raping, lad? Nice work, lad.

01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:04.900
No, I haven't raped her.

01:23:04.900 --> 01:23:07.000
No, you wouldn't have, you poncey little git.

01:23:07.100 --> 01:23:10.000
You're not the prawn of my loins.
Your mother's a bloody liar.

01:23:10.100 --> 01:23:11.500
That's what I liked about her.

01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:15.000
She couldn't be your mother.
No woman ever slept with me and lived.

01:23:15.100 --> 01:23:17.500
- What's happened to Daddy?
- I killed him.

01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:19.300
He's gone to heaven.

01:23:19.400 --> 01:23:22.600
Oh, that's nice. He sent all his friends there.

01:23:22.700 --> 01:23:24.400
She's yours, is she then, Dan?

01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:27.100
Let me have a bit of a prod at her first.

01:23:27.200 --> 01:23:29.400
- Father!
- Captain Dan!

01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:31.600
Captain Dan. It's Mr...

01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000
- Who?
- It's...

01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:41.000
It's Mr. Moon.

01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:44.100
Moon? That shithead Moon?

01:23:44.100 --> 01:23:46.500
It's time I got rid of him.

01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:48.900
Dad, stop. Look, we'll all fight Mr. Moon.

01:23:48.900 --> 01:23:51.800
Oh, good. Another battle. Well done, Son.

01:23:52.300 --> 01:23:53.500
Dan.

01:23:58.700 --> 01:24:02.000
Come on, men. Let's go get our treasure.

01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:12.700
So long, mate.

01:24:13.100 --> 01:24:16.300
Don't worry. I'll spend your share.

01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:20.700
- No, you won't, Mr. Moon.
- It's little Captain Dan, huh?

01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:23.000
Yellowbeard!

01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:25.700
Moon, you bastard, what betrayed me.

01:24:28.500 --> 01:24:32.800
I'm gonna make you eat
both your own buttocks.

01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:40.200
I've got a score to settle with you,
Captain Yellowbeard.

01:24:51.100 --> 01:24:52.300
Good girl.

01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:09.100
Hold your throat on this sword.

01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:19.700
He's all yours, lad.

01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:01.100
Dan, watch out.

01:26:30.800 --> 01:26:32.100
Get going!

01:26:33.300 --> 01:26:35.600
Great shot, young lady.

01:26:41.900 --> 01:26:43.400
Later, Triola. I must find my father.

01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:46.800
You mean Yellowbeard? He went that way.

01:26:50.300 --> 01:26:52.100
Well, Commander Clement...

01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:56.300
I had high hopes
you would consider sharing.

01:26:56.400 --> 01:26:59.100
Just lead me to Yellowbeard's treasure,
Mrs. Beard.

01:26:59.200 --> 01:27:00.900
- That's all I want.
- Right.

01:27:01.500 --> 01:27:04.000
Well, as I recall...

01:27:05.100 --> 01:27:07.300
it should be in that direction.

01:27:07.400 --> 01:27:11.100
Let's see, that's stagger, stagger,
crawl, crawl...

01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:15.900
No, that's crawl, crawl. Right.

01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:20.300
Crawl, sir?

01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:22.600
Come on, men.

01:27:23.400 --> 01:27:25.900
Right, right.

01:27:29.500 --> 01:27:33.300
Stagger, stagger, right and jump.

01:27:33.300 --> 01:27:35.200
- And stagger.
- Jump.

01:27:35.300 --> 01:27:39.200
- Stagger, stagger, jump.
- Jump. Wait for me, sir.

01:27:39.900 --> 01:27:42.600
It's quite good exercise this, really, isn't it?

01:27:42.700 --> 01:27:46.200
Get shot, stagger, stagger, stagger...

01:27:47.300 --> 01:27:48.800
roll...

01:27:48.900 --> 01:27:53.700
stagger, stagger, stagger a little bit, then...

01:27:54.700 --> 01:27:58.100
stagger, stagger, crawl, stagger...

01:27:58.200 --> 01:28:00.900
stagger, stagger, roll...

01:28:03.100 --> 01:28:05.600
and crawl, crawl, crawl...

01:28:06.300 --> 01:28:09.500
- stagger, stagger, stagger...
- Father, are you all right?

01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:13.100
...stagger, stagger, stagger...
- Father?

01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:17.800
You made me forget where I was,
you stupid little sod.

01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:19.300
- What were you doing?
- Shut up!

01:28:19.300 --> 01:28:22.000
Did I just say stagger or was it crawl?

01:28:22.100 --> 01:28:23.800
- I don't know.
- It was crawl.

01:28:23.900 --> 01:28:26.700
But was it crawl to the right,
crawl to the left...

01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:31.100
or crawl, crawl, then to the right,
then stagger? Or was it...

01:28:31.200 --> 01:28:32.900
Oh, bugger me,
you've sodded the whole thing up...

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:34.900
like the stupid little twerp that you are.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:38.500
I was recreating what happened to me
20 years ago, man and boy.

01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:39.900
Why didn't you stay with us?

01:28:39.900 --> 01:28:42.700
- Because I wanted to betray you.
- But why?

01:28:42.900 --> 01:28:45.400
I had to. Betraying's all part of pirating.

01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:47.900
If you don't know that,
you're not even close to being a pirate.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.500
- Prawn of my loins, my foot.
- What?

01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:52.900
You're either born a pirate or not.

01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:56.800
It's in the blood, Dan, and it's not in your
blood, or you'd have betrayed me long ago.

01:28:56.900 --> 01:29:00.000
All right, I may not be a pirate,
but at least I've got a brain in my head...

01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:01.700
so why don't we
just follow the instructions?

01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:03.000
Right.

01:29:07.900 --> 01:29:08.900
Right.

01:29:09.300 --> 01:29:14.000
Six paces north, left at the rock,
then four paces west.

01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:17.100
Right, come on, lad.

01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:20.500
Give us a hand. Stride, stride, stagger left...

01:29:20.600 --> 01:29:23.100
stride, stride, then dig.

01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:26.900
Go on, make yourself useful, lad.

01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:30.400
You know, the way you was
fighting back there...

01:29:30.500 --> 01:29:33.000
there may be some pirate blood in you,
after all.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:36.300
Well, I did have a hand
in forcing Mr. Moon into the acid.

01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:40.700
With your head on my shoulders,
we can wreck civilization.

01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:45.900
- And stagger and jump and jump...
- Keep hopping.

01:29:46.000 --> 01:29:47.600
...and stagger and stagger and jump.

01:29:49.700 --> 01:29:53.200
Go on, Dan, use your dagger.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:01.200
- Look at it all.
- Hip, hip, hooray!

01:30:01.900 --> 01:30:05.200
- Triola, we're rich.
- Come on, Dan.

01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:08.500
Congratulations, Father.

01:30:10.500 --> 01:30:12.500
But I didn't...

01:30:13.100 --> 01:30:16.100
- You are a Yellowbeard.
- What?

01:30:18.500 --> 01:30:22.600
Killing your father
as I killed my father before me.

01:30:24.300 --> 01:30:26.800
- Dad, the blood.
- Blood.

01:30:29.200 --> 01:30:31.200
That's what I like to hear.

01:30:31.900 --> 01:30:33.900
You are my son.

01:30:41.700 --> 01:30:43.700
Halt, in the name of the law!

01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:48.500
Well done there, lad. Got him at last.

01:30:48.900 --> 01:30:50.700
All right, men. Keep your guns on him.

01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:55.100
Hello, Dan. Hello, lambchop.
Wonderful to see you.

01:30:55.400 --> 01:30:57.000
Pity about your dad.

01:30:57.100 --> 01:31:00.700
On the other hand, it is the way
what he said he always wanted to go.

01:31:00.800 --> 01:31:02.100
Horribly.

01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:05.600
Commander Clement, Royal Navy.

01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:10.200
- I claim this treasure...
- He claims it?

01:31:10.200 --> 01:31:13.100
...in the name of Her Majesty, Queen Anne.

01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:16.700
Dan, darling,
I don't think I love you anymore.

01:31:17.100 --> 01:31:19.100
You're right. You don't.

01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:20.900
Goodbye, Triola.

01:31:20.900 --> 01:31:23.900
There's at least two more chests down there.

01:31:24.100 --> 01:31:26.800
You'll be a duke now, sir. Won't you, sir?

01:31:27.700 --> 01:31:29.900
Duty, Mansell. That's my reward.

01:31:30.900 --> 01:31:32.100
Duke, eh?

01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:36.600
You've got a lovely bottom, blue eyes.

01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:39.000
- I think I love you.
- What?

01:31:39.300 --> 01:31:42.600
She said you've got a lovely bottom,
sir, and...

01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:44.500
- Shut up, Mansell.
- Yes, sir.

01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:48.300
- Right, Mansell, clap those people in irons.
- Sir.

01:31:52.700 --> 01:31:55.300
You poor dear. You must have suffered.

01:31:55.600 --> 01:31:58.500
- Tell me about it.
- It was simply awful.

01:32:10.300 --> 01:32:13.500
Sir, I was just thinking...

01:32:14.100 --> 01:32:16.700
Her Majesty can have no idea...

01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:19.500
how much treasure we've got. Can she, sir?

01:32:20.500 --> 01:32:22.000
No, she can't.

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.200
- Have one yourself.
- Thank you, sir.

01:32:25.700 --> 01:32:28.700
Or even where we are.

01:32:30.400 --> 01:32:31.900
I say, sir.

01:32:33.700 --> 01:32:37.600
Mansell, are you thinking
what I think you're thinking?

01:32:37.900 --> 01:32:40.300
I'll think whatever you say, sir.

01:32:42.100 --> 01:32:44.600
Ever been to the Americas?

01:32:49.400 --> 01:32:53.000
Us Yellowbeards are never more dangerous
than when we're dead.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:55.200
Dan.

01:32:57.300 --> 01:32:59.000
I think I love you.

01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:02.300
Come on, lad, there's pirating to be done.

01:33:03.305 --> 01:33:09.864
