00:01.480 --> 00:03.155
Hi, I'm Janet King.

00:03.160 --> 00:04.560
Who is it, babe?

00:05.960 --> 00:07.515
Ah, hello.

00:07.520 --> 00:09.755
An illegal relationship
between a sicko and a child.

00:09.760 --> 00:11.395
Flynn pulling on his
pants isn't evidence,

00:11.400 --> 00:12.795
nor is him touching her arm.

00:12.800 --> 00:14.395
I mean, he's given
her a place to stay...

00:14.400 --> 00:17.435
- As long as she has sex with him.
- But we can't prove that to a court.

00:17.440 --> 00:19.115
Our supplements are above board.

00:19.120 --> 00:21.315
You have all the
paperwork from Eddie Cooke.

00:21.320 --> 00:23.115
I mean, we never failed a drug test.

00:23.120 --> 00:26.435
I need an assurance. When we
find this drug, Nate will talk.

00:26.440 --> 00:28.155
I told you, there's none left.

00:28.160 --> 00:29.475
Your inaction will mean

00:29.480 --> 00:31.795
that Nate Baldwin's going to
talk to the Crime Commission,

00:31.800 --> 00:33.635
which can't happen, as you well know.

00:33.640 --> 00:36.555
Now a drug that gets the
Devils from last to fourth.

00:36.560 --> 00:38.755
FLYNN: One bottle, 20 grand cash.

00:38.760 --> 00:40.275
MAXINE: You've gotta be kidding me.

00:40.280 --> 00:42.835
EDDIE: I think this
might be able to help you.

00:42.840 --> 00:44.915
And there's no chance
of it testing positive?

00:44.920 --> 00:47.755
Lots of guys were on it
last year. Passed everything.

00:47.760 --> 00:49.955
H2O. It was water.

00:49.960 --> 00:51.235
What?

00:51.240 --> 00:53.195
Eddie gave Zoe plain old tap water.

00:53.200 --> 00:55.035
Can you seriously get 10 grand for this?

00:55.040 --> 00:56.915
- Flynn was offering 20.
- Be stupid not to.

00:56.920 --> 00:59.115
Oi, Cindi, for fuck's sake!
I need that money. Stop!

00:59.120 --> 01:01.275
JUDGE: Mr Baldwin,

01:01.280 --> 01:03.915
on one count of manslaughter,

01:03.920 --> 01:05.600
I find you guilty.

NATE: It's all over. Greg...

01:49.680 --> 01:51.275
I could be in here for
12 years. I can't do it.

01:51.280 --> 01:52.715
It might not be that long, right?

01:52.720 --> 01:54.155
- It could be.
- We can appeal.

01:54.160 --> 01:56.275
- Or can we? He says we can't.
- I said we needed grounds.

01:56.280 --> 01:58.155
What happened to finding the
drug that Tyler was taking?

01:58.160 --> 01:59.515
Are the NCC still trying to find it?

01:59.520 --> 02:01.715
I believe so, and if they
find it they will hand it over,

02:01.720 --> 02:03.555
I'm certain of that, almost.

02:03.560 --> 02:04.755
I'm sick of your bloody 'if's.

02:04.760 --> 02:06.115
Look, I will get Janet on the phone...

02:06.120 --> 02:07.115
Oh, no, no, please.

02:07.120 --> 02:08.914
It's pretty clear that you
don't have the pull with her

02:08.919 --> 02:09.914
that you thought you did.

02:09.919 --> 02:11.715
I'll get someone else. Nate,
please, we need Richard.

02:11.720 --> 02:13.075
No, we need someone better, Luce.

02:13.080 --> 02:14.475
So, you're withdrawing my instructions?

02:14.480 --> 02:16.035
I'm letting you go, yeah, you're fired.

02:16.040 --> 02:17.515
Nate, before you make
any rash decisions...

02:17.520 --> 02:19.475
It's made, Rich, you're gone.

02:19.480 --> 02:21.595
Now I didn't kill Ty and
I shouldn't be in here,

02:21.600 --> 02:23.080
so get the fuck out!

02:32.000 --> 02:33.355
Look, just back me up on this, Luce,

02:33.360 --> 02:35.995
and find me someone who can
get me out of this, yeah?

02:36.000 --> 02:38.435
He can, Nate. You've just
fired your best chance.

02:38.440 --> 02:41.040
Why do you always have
to lose it at people?

02:45.640 --> 02:46.835
Look, I'm sorry, Okay? Just...

02:46.840 --> 02:50.160
I'll see you soon. Just
stay strong, please.

02:54.400 --> 02:57.035
- She's right.
- Shut up, Maxine. You're fired too.

02:57.040 --> 02:58.755
Well, being a dickhead's
not going to help.

02:58.760 --> 03:02.555
I'm going to lose her. If I don't
get out of here, Luce will leave me.

03:02.560 --> 03:05.075
I've gotta spill my guts to the
NCC. That will knock some time off.

03:05.080 --> 03:06.315
- No, not happening.
- I've got to.

03:06.320 --> 03:08.115
You tell them nothing!

03:08.120 --> 03:10.600
Now you think very carefully
about this, for everyone's sake.

03:16.640 --> 03:19.875
He just needs to calm down and
then we can work something out.

03:19.880 --> 03:21.835
Because right now there's
no food in the fridge,

03:21.840 --> 03:24.395
I need petrol and I've
got 10 in my wallet.

03:24.400 --> 03:25.835
And I know that's selfish,

03:25.840 --> 03:27.595
thinking of myself
when he's in there, but,

03:27.600 --> 03:30.715
I mean, I've got clothing
and jewellery I could sell.

03:30.720 --> 03:33.195
But the mortgage.
They'll take the house.

03:33.200 --> 03:35.675
It's Okay, you won't lose
access to your bank accounts.

03:35.680 --> 03:36.664
I don't have any.

03:36.687 --> 03:39.675
But you must have a credit or debit
card, even a supplementary one.

03:39.680 --> 03:42.523
No, he's got all the cards. What
would have happened to that stuff?

03:42.547 --> 03:44.595
All personal items
get bagged and stored.

03:44.600 --> 03:47.395
- You can apply to have them released.
- I don't even know his PIN, anyway.

03:47.400 --> 03:49.035
Did he really handle all the money?

03:49.040 --> 03:51.000
Yeah, why is that so strange?

03:54.360 --> 03:56.115
So, when Eddie was run
off the road last night,

03:56.120 --> 03:58.155
he got minor whiplash
and a couple of scratches.

03:58.160 --> 04:00.475
The airbags work, it seems.
Did he see the driver?

04:00.480 --> 04:01.795
Told the police it was too dark.

04:01.800 --> 04:03.195
All we know is the other car was blue,

04:03.200 --> 04:04.955
from a scrape of paint on his car.

04:04.960 --> 04:08.195
It all happened so fast.
I swear, I saw nothing.

04:08.200 --> 04:10.115
Have you had a falling
out with anyone recently?

04:10.120 --> 04:12.955
- Arguments? Fights?
- No.

04:12.960 --> 04:14.675
What about the Devils Football Club?

04:14.680 --> 04:16.515
Were questions asked about
your supplement program

04:16.519 --> 04:17.915
after Tyler Perati died?

04:17.920 --> 04:21.315
The Devils took ever ASADA
test without a single failure.

04:21.320 --> 04:23.915
Are they on the same program this year?

04:23.920 --> 04:26.155
Not at the moment.
Anyone upset about that?

04:26.160 --> 04:27.840
Not that I know of.

04:37.120 --> 04:40.475
So, this was a couple of
days ago. What was it about?

04:40.480 --> 04:45.635
Well, Maxine was angry that I
cancelled Lucy Baldwin's contract

04:45.640 --> 04:48.599
as the face of the clinic, but I had to.

04:48.693 --> 04:50.168
Her husband killed Tyler Perati.

04:50.173 --> 04:51.448
You expect us to believe

04:51.453 --> 04:53.968
that Maxine was that
furious over a PR contract?

04:53.973 --> 04:57.808
It was a good earner for
her, so, yeah, she was angry.

04:57.813 --> 04:59.568
Do you think Maxine ran me off the road?

04:59.573 --> 05:03.608
Possibly, but if so, we don't
think it was about Lucy Baldwin.

05:03.613 --> 05:07.333
Can you remember who came into your
clinic right after that argument?

05:08.613 --> 05:10.968
We have access to the footage
from this camera, Mr Cooke,

05:10.973 --> 05:12.613
so please answer the question.

05:13.733 --> 05:16.608
- Zoe DiCosta.
- And what was she there for?

05:16.613 --> 05:20.088
One of her athletes is injured,
so she asked if I could help.

05:20.093 --> 05:21.488
Could you?

05:21.493 --> 05:25.208
I think I said I might have
something to help tissue recovery.

05:25.213 --> 05:27.448
But it wasn't the supplement
you'd given the Devils?

05:27.453 --> 05:29.008
No, no.

05:29.013 --> 05:31.688
It was more a cortisone-type
derivative, I think.

05:31.693 --> 05:35.208
I really didn't give it
much thought, to be honest.

05:35.213 --> 05:37.048
Wasn't paying attention.

05:37.053 --> 05:40.128
Because your mind was still on
the argument with Maxine Reynolds?

05:40.133 --> 05:42.368
Yes. Well, that had really shaken me.

05:42.373 --> 05:44.933
But all you talked
about was Lucy Baldwin.

05:54.893 --> 05:57.288
Janet, you put the wind up Eddie Cooke.

05:57.293 --> 05:58.968
He made a phone call as soon as he left,

05:58.973 --> 06:02.728
to a prepaid mobile phone registered
in the name of Dorothy Gale.

06:02.733 --> 06:05.008
- The Wizard of Oz?
- That's Dorothy's surname.

06:05.013 --> 06:06.608
She had a surname?

06:06.613 --> 06:09.208
Well, so, who's the real Dorothy Gale?

06:09.213 --> 06:11.368
EDDIE: (ON RECORDING)
What the hell's going on?

06:11.373 --> 06:12.368
What have I done wrong?

06:12.373 --> 06:14.368
MAXINE: Why are you calling
this number? I told you not to.

06:14.373 --> 06:15.848
Don't ever do it again.

06:15.853 --> 06:17.288
Maxine's got a burner phone.

06:17.293 --> 06:18.768
Apparently so.

06:18.773 --> 06:20.808
Her legit phone was
geo-located to her place.

06:20.813 --> 06:22.328
It was there all last night.

06:22.333 --> 06:23.648
Which would have been strong evidence

06:23.653 --> 06:25.048
she wasn't out running Eddie down.

06:25.053 --> 06:26.093
But now means nothing.

06:28.133 --> 06:30.928
Could Maxine be the head
of the whole syndicate?

06:30.933 --> 06:33.288
Well, that would mean she's
let her own client go to jail

06:33.293 --> 06:35.568
over a drug that propped
up her betting plunges.

06:35.573 --> 06:38.008
And she's responsible for
Clay's death, and Oliver, too.

06:38.013 --> 06:39.728
(LAUGHS) Interesting business model.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.208
Well, what's worth more?

06:41.213 --> 06:43.328
Sharing Clay Nelson's
retirement earnings,

06:43.333 --> 06:45.608
or a gambling syndicate
raking in millions?

06:45.613 --> 06:47.248
Let's crosscheck Maxine's other phone

06:47.253 --> 06:48.608
with all the other betting plunges.

06:48.613 --> 06:50.488
We need people involved,
times, everything.

06:50.493 --> 06:52.848
BIANCA: Sure, but if she really
wanted that drug from Flynn,

06:52.853 --> 06:55.408
why didn't she just tell
him she's the head honcho?

06:55.413 --> 06:58.328
Maybe she didn't want Flynn
to know how important she was.

06:58.333 --> 07:00.528
Oh, yeah, bit of a
crisis there last night.

07:00.533 --> 07:03.248
Pearl's friend drank something
and started throwing up blood.

07:03.253 --> 07:05.008
So Pearl called Flynn to
get her to the hospital,

07:05.013 --> 07:07.008
which is how we heard, via the TI.

07:07.013 --> 07:08.168
Her friend drank something?

07:08.173 --> 07:10.893
Yeah. Not alcohol,
sounded more like a drug.

07:14.853 --> 07:16.808
You sure about this?

07:16.813 --> 07:20.053
Well, she needed the money. Maybe
SHE swapped it for the water.

07:22.933 --> 07:26.168
Pearl, hi. How's your friend doing?

07:26.173 --> 07:29.048
Yeah, I think she'll be
fine. What are you doing here?

07:29.053 --> 07:33.408
Hospitals have to report cases
involving unknown substances,

07:33.413 --> 07:35.293
and then they let us know.

07:39.293 --> 07:40.773
What did she drink?

07:43.773 --> 07:45.613
I'll go see how Wayne's getting on.

07:49.853 --> 07:52.168
Pearl, we're looking for something
that we believe Flynn had.

07:52.173 --> 07:54.013
Something we think you might have taken.

07:55.253 --> 07:56.813
Did you get it form Flynn?

08:00.693 --> 08:02.293
Pearl, this is very important.

08:03.893 --> 08:05.493
What did it look like? Was it labelled?

08:08.773 --> 08:09.968
Is there any left?

08:09.973 --> 08:11.888
I don't know what it was. It
was in a little brown bottle.

08:11.893 --> 08:13.293
Okay, good. Where is it now?

08:15.013 --> 08:16.688
Pearl, tell me where it is, Okay?

08:16.693 --> 08:19.008
After your friend vomited, what did
she do? Did she drop it, give it...

08:19.013 --> 08:20.768
She was throwing up blood
everywhere. I freaked, Okay?

08:20.773 --> 08:22.248
I didn't care about the fucking bottle!

08:22.253 --> 08:24.048
- Did you know what it was worth?
- I thought she was dying.

08:24.053 --> 08:26.053
I just wanted to get her
here. What do you think I am?

08:27.133 --> 08:29.016
Have you got it?

08:29.053 --> 08:31.368
Oh, you wanna search me or something?

08:31.373 --> 08:34.888
Okay, Okay. Just please,
don't go back to Flynn.

08:34.893 --> 08:36.332
I'll do whatever I want, alright?

08:50.813 --> 08:53.968
Patient records from the ED
indicate the doctor who treated Cindi

08:53.973 --> 08:56.208
asked them if they still
had some of what she took.

08:56.213 --> 08:57.688
Neither did.

08:57.693 --> 09:00.128
Well, if they didn't have it on them,

09:00.133 --> 09:02.208
it's probably still in the park.

09:02.213 --> 09:04.573
- Could be in Flynn's car.
- But they stole it from him.

09:06.053 --> 09:07.248
If she knows it's worth that much,

09:07.253 --> 09:08.733
would she really leave it in the park?

09:10.613 --> 09:11.973
She's still got it.

09:14.533 --> 09:16.693
(RINGING TONE)

09:18.133 --> 09:20.088
Straight to voicemail.

09:20.093 --> 09:21.933
Pearl, it's Janet. Can you call me?

09:28.173 --> 09:31.288
(PHONE RINGS)

09:31.293 --> 09:33.928
Bonnie, hi. Yeah, it's
me. I need to find Pearl.

09:33.933 --> 09:35.928
Can we track her phone?
Is it on our system?

09:35.933 --> 09:38.448
- Yep.
- Great. Where is she?

09:38.453 --> 09:40.048
Hang on, should be able to...

09:40.053 --> 09:42.213
No, sorry, can't locate
it. She's turned it off.

09:43.773 --> 09:45.373
Okay. No. Thanks.

09:51.973 --> 09:53.728
RICHARD: So, from what I can work out,

09:53.733 --> 09:56.488
everything's in Nate's name, except
for the online betting account,

09:56.493 --> 09:59.373
which is empty, and this.

10:01.693 --> 10:03.648
The convertible?

10:03.653 --> 10:05.888
- Why's that in my name? It's his car.
- I don't know.

10:05.893 --> 10:07.368
Camera fines go on your licence?

10:07.373 --> 10:09.368
But because it is in your
name, you can sell it.

10:09.373 --> 10:11.168
He loves that car.

10:11.173 --> 10:12.608
Well, he does have two others

10:12.613 --> 10:14.128
and it's going to be
a while before he can...

10:14.133 --> 10:15.728
No, I... I couldn't do that.

10:15.733 --> 10:17.968
He bought it after the winning
the club's best and fairest.

10:17.973 --> 10:19.968
Okay, well, you'll need to ask
him to make you a signatory

10:19.973 --> 10:22.928
on his accounts, or give
you power of attorney.

10:22.933 --> 10:24.568
You shouldn't be trapped like this.

10:24.573 --> 10:27.408
- I'm not trapped.
- Okay, I meant shielded.

10:27.413 --> 10:28.888
I'm not a victim, Richard.

10:28.893 --> 10:31.328
It's just how things turned
out. He was taking care of me.

10:31.333 --> 10:33.168
By controlling where you
could go and what you could do?

10:33.173 --> 10:35.128
Okay, can you please not
judge me or my life?

10:35.133 --> 10:37.048
- Nate's not some monster.
- I'm not saying that.

10:37.053 --> 10:38.048
If you want to help, help.

10:38.053 --> 10:40.573
If you want to undermine
and criticise, please go.

10:42.973 --> 10:44.333
Okay.

10:45.853 --> 10:48.208
Bank statements, credit card statements,

10:48.213 --> 10:50.328
utility bills, phone bills,

10:50.333 --> 10:52.648
mortgage account, though
he'd paid a lot of that off,

10:52.653 --> 10:53.848
and he kept the redraw facility

10:53.853 --> 10:56.128
so you've got several months
before you need to worry about that.

10:56.133 --> 10:59.688
Um, plenty of time to
get things under control,

10:59.693 --> 11:01.648
if you can access your savings account.

11:01.653 --> 11:03.768
Okay. Thank you.

11:03.773 --> 11:06.168
No problem. Accountancy
is not everyone's skill.

11:06.173 --> 11:08.368
And how boring would
the world be if it was?

11:08.373 --> 11:09.533
Mm. Exactly.

11:13.533 --> 11:16.008
When I was driving back
here, I called the prison,

11:16.013 --> 11:17.608
just to see if I could
talk to Nate again,

11:17.613 --> 11:19.288
see if he'd calmed down,

11:19.293 --> 11:23.008
and they said I could but
he wouldn't take my call.

11:23.013 --> 11:24.533
He's scared.

11:25.853 --> 11:29.253
He's scared of losing
you, especially now.

11:33.413 --> 11:36.733
Well, thank you again, for
today, for organising things.

11:39.773 --> 11:40.773
Drink?

12:03.893 --> 12:05.088
Mrs Perati?

12:05.093 --> 12:07.448
- Yeah?
- Hi. I'm Janet King.

12:07.453 --> 12:10.008
Yeah, I remember. What do you want now?

12:10.013 --> 12:11.213
I'm looking for Pearl.

12:12.733 --> 12:14.048
Well, she's not here.

12:14.053 --> 12:16.528
I was hoping that you might be
able to tell me where she is.

12:16.533 --> 12:20.408
Little slut. If it wasn't
for her, I'd still have Ty.

12:20.413 --> 12:22.008
He was going to buy me a house.

12:22.013 --> 12:23.848
She's not a slut.
She... she was assaulted.

12:23.853 --> 12:24.928
Nah, nah.

12:24.933 --> 12:27.368
She knew she did the wrong
thing, and that's why she left.

12:27.373 --> 12:30.808
No, it wasn't. You need to
know she didn't feel safe here.

12:30.813 --> 12:33.448
- Oh, is that what she said?
- Yeah.

12:33.453 --> 12:36.968
You just believed her without
having a clue what she's really like?

12:36.973 --> 12:39.853
She's a lying little shit.

12:43.293 --> 12:46.773
But Ty... beautiful boy.

12:48.973 --> 12:51.128
He could outrun all the other kids,

12:51.133 --> 12:52.933
even before he started school.

12:54.653 --> 12:56.648
Pearl tagged along.

12:56.653 --> 12:58.848
She got picked for reps. She
could have been good, too.

12:58.853 --> 13:01.288
But Ty...

13:01.293 --> 13:03.653
Ty was gonna make
first grade, you know?

13:05.373 --> 13:06.928
He was gonna look after us.

13:06.933 --> 13:11.048
She's your daughter, still,
Okay, and she needs you.

13:11.053 --> 13:14.728
Oh, do you think that she's
the only one who's hurting?

13:14.733 --> 13:17.088
What about me?

13:17.093 --> 13:18.848
Did that ungrateful
bitch stop and think...

13:18.853 --> 13:20.688
- Okay, she's just a kid.
- ..how I'm feeling?

13:20.693 --> 13:22.448
- You're her mother!
- You know what?

13:22.453 --> 13:27.128
Kev said to get rid of this. You
love her so much, you take it.

13:27.133 --> 13:29.893
- Listen, I really need to find...
- Piss off!

- Yes?
- BONNIE: It's on.

13:52.653 --> 13:54.248
- What?
- Pearl's phone.

13:54.253 --> 13:55.648
Great, where is she?

13:55.653 --> 13:59.048
She's at... the corner of James Street

13:59.053 --> 14:00.813
and Pitt Street in Redfern.

14:07.973 --> 14:09.688
- MAN: It's worth it, right?
- Yeah.

14:09.693 --> 14:11.088
- No, it's good stuff, yeah.
- Pearl!

14:11.093 --> 14:12.493
- Oh, shit!
- Oi, come back!

14:14.333 --> 14:16.528
- Why can't you leave me alone?!
- Why can't you tell me the truth?

14:16.533 --> 14:18.888
Why couldn't you tell me that you
were such a below average human?

14:18.893 --> 14:20.168
- Pearl, just stop.
- Fuck off.

14:20.173 --> 14:21.973
Alright. Just...

14:23.013 --> 14:25.208
- Just give it to me, alright?
- What?

14:25.213 --> 14:27.528
That bottle is a
critical piece of evidence

14:27.533 --> 14:28.568
in a national investigation.

14:28.573 --> 14:30.848
Now, if you want to get
arrested, fine, run off.

14:30.853 --> 14:34.693
If not, just give it to
me and we can move on.

14:39.733 --> 14:40.928
Thank you.

14:40.933 --> 14:43.448
I was gonna pay for my own
place. You know that, right?

14:43.453 --> 14:44.933
Thanks a lot.

BIANCA: Her mother disowns her daughter,

14:52.693 --> 14:54.448
and then gets a stranger
to break it to her.

14:54.453 --> 14:56.128
I know, I'm going to
have to find the moment.

14:56.133 --> 14:57.533
It's never-ending for that poor kid.

14:58.653 --> 15:00.448
Bottom line, you had to get that drug.

15:00.453 --> 15:02.688
Yeah, but I shouldn't have broken
the connection I'd made with her.

15:02.693 --> 15:04.808
I'm sure you haven't. She
put up a pretty big wall.

15:04.813 --> 15:08.648
Well, she's 15. God, my...
my tantrums were epic at 15.

15:08.653 --> 15:10.968
I can't imagine you having a tantrum.

15:10.973 --> 15:14.008
Teenage me was a lot
moodier than I am now.

15:14.013 --> 15:16.448
The point is, in that moment,
you had bigger priorities.

15:16.453 --> 15:19.453
That's Okay. Stop being
so tough on yourself.

15:20.933 --> 15:22.973
It's a hard habit to break.

15:25.293 --> 15:26.893
I'm doing my best.

15:30.653 --> 15:32.528
Yes, you are.

15:32.533 --> 15:33.968
- Kids asleep?
- Mm-hm.

15:33.973 --> 15:35.413
I just want to check on them.

15:43.213 --> 15:45.608
LUCY: So, why did you become a lawyer?

15:45.613 --> 15:47.808
Seemed like a good idea,

15:47.813 --> 15:50.653
and, um, I really thought
I could make a difference.

15:52.253 --> 15:53.493
Why did you become a pianist?

15:54.733 --> 15:56.608
Or not.

15:56.613 --> 15:59.088
- You still play?
- Hm, not really.

15:59.093 --> 16:01.688
- But you can.
- Yeah, of course.

16:01.693 --> 16:06.088
- Then you're a pianist.
- Oh, a pianist needs an audience.

16:06.093 --> 16:08.448
Did Nate like listening to you play?

16:08.453 --> 16:09.933
No, it wasn't really his thing.

16:13.253 --> 16:15.768
It's funny how you can end up so
far from where you started out.

16:15.773 --> 16:17.688
Yeah, you think you want something

16:17.693 --> 16:20.453
and then it doesn't end up
how you thought it would be.

16:23.253 --> 16:24.888
I always thought I was
going to be someone.

16:24.893 --> 16:26.768
You are.

I'm someone people pretend to talk
to, until they can talk to Nate.

and then, "Where's Nate?"

16:36.973 --> 16:40.008
You never pretended
to talk to me, though.

16:40.013 --> 16:42.328
You always really talked.

16:42.333 --> 16:44.608
And maintained eye contact?

16:44.613 --> 16:46.773
(LAUGHS) Always.

16:49.413 --> 16:51.928
- Play me something.
- No, I'm so out of practice.

16:51.933 --> 16:54.288
I don't care, I want to hear you play.

16:54.293 --> 16:55.973

16:58.093 --> 16:59.293

this a lot today, but... thank you.

18:52.373 --> 18:53.853
For what?

18:54.893 --> 18:56.093
Listening.

18:57.573 --> 19:01.773
It's been a really long time since
someone really listened... to me.

19:03.293 --> 19:05.373
I have no idea why.

19:30.013 --> 19:31.768
THX-5.

19:31.773 --> 19:33.528
Confirmed as the drug that killed Tyler

19:33.533 --> 19:36.253
and gave Cindi Jackson a gastro bleed.

19:37.573 --> 19:40.208
According to the lab, its main
function is to thin the blood.

19:40.213 --> 19:41.728
Which is what you want in a PED.

19:41.733 --> 19:44.368
Faster blood flow means
faster oxygen uptake,

19:44.373 --> 19:46.768
which means better stamina,
faster recovery times.

19:46.773 --> 19:49.248
- So, what is it, exactly?
- It doesn't have a brand name.

19:49.253 --> 19:51.008
- No brand name?
- It's not on the market.

19:51.013 --> 19:52.768
It IS on the market. It's
in a bottle, it's being used.

19:52.773 --> 19:55.088
But it hasn't actually
been tested on people,

19:55.093 --> 19:56.368
meaning that officially

19:56.373 --> 19:58.008
it's classified as "not
for human consumption".

19:58.013 --> 19:59.368
So, it's not on ASADA's banned list

19:59.373 --> 20:00.928
because people aren't meant to take it.

20:00.933 --> 20:02.928
- Correct.
- That is seriously sicko.

20:02.933 --> 20:04.448
So, he's been used as a guinea pig?

20:04.453 --> 20:05.688
Maybe the whole team were on it.

20:05.693 --> 20:08.173
Given the way they played
last season, I bet they were.

20:09.533 --> 20:11.048
I should rephrase that.

20:11.053 --> 20:12.368
- Yes.
- Sorry.

20:12.373 --> 20:14.288
So, why didn't they all react that way?

20:14.293 --> 20:17.168
Something in Tyler's DNA meant he
had a reaction others didn't get.

20:17.173 --> 20:19.648
Of course, proper clinical trials
would have identified that risk,

20:19.653 --> 20:21.808
but it meant that the slightest knock

20:21.813 --> 20:23.008
led to uncontrolled bleeding.

20:23.013 --> 20:25.088
And, in Cindi's case,
it burst a stomach ulcer

20:25.093 --> 20:27.288
she got from eating
ibuprofen like peanuts.

20:27.293 --> 20:30.568
And it breaks causation
for Nate Baldwin's punch.

20:30.573 --> 20:32.848
- We have to tell Richard.
- I know, but when?

20:32.853 --> 20:34.688
We still want Nate to
tell us what he knows.

20:34.693 --> 20:36.208
At this point in time,
we can't withhold this

20:36.213 --> 20:37.648
in exchange for that information,

20:37.653 --> 20:39.608
or we're perverting
the course of justice.

20:39.613 --> 20:42.088
- We need a different tactic.
- Okay, challenge accepted.

20:42.093 --> 20:44.733
I'll go tell Richard we've
saved his number one client.

20:47.093 --> 20:49.048
Isn't this the chance
we were waiting for?

20:49.053 --> 20:50.368
Can't we just say, "Hey, schmuck, talk,

20:50.373 --> 20:51.768
"or we throw the bottle
into the harbour"?

20:51.773 --> 20:52.968
No.

20:52.973 --> 20:54.768
Even as a bluff, just till he fesses up?

20:54.773 --> 20:55.888
Wasn't that the plan before?

20:55.893 --> 20:58.128
There was a moment in time,
before he was convicted,

20:58.133 --> 20:59.768
where a game like that might have worked

20:59.773 --> 21:03.048
because of his desperation,
but now it won't.

21:03.053 --> 21:06.248
But Nate could take us straight
to Maxine, and the mystery man.

21:06.253 --> 21:08.048
He knows who that is.
He knows the top players.

21:08.053 --> 21:10.208
Yes, and he knows that because
he's part of this whole seedy mess,

21:10.213 --> 21:11.408
as are Flynn and Eddie.

21:11.413 --> 21:14.048
I mean, any one of them could
give evidence against their boss

21:14.053 --> 21:16.368
if they weren't so scared of them.

21:16.373 --> 21:20.088
So, this is a new game - the first
person to talk gets protected.

21:20.093 --> 21:21.733
And now we just need
them all under pressure.

It's fantastic. Yes.

21:35.933 --> 21:37.093
Ah, thank you.

21:39.173 --> 21:40.928

21:40.933 --> 21:43.568
- There's grounds for an appeal.
- So Nate will get out?

21:43.573 --> 21:45.088
Almost certainly.

agreeing to meet with us.

22:19.133 --> 22:20.768
Have I got a choice?

22:20.773 --> 22:23.808
Are you aware that an untested
drug in your possession

22:23.813 --> 22:26.208
contributed to the
death of Tyler Perati?

22:26.213 --> 22:28.128
- Wait? What?
- This is bullshit.

22:28.133 --> 22:30.813
We have an immediate notice to
attend, which is enforceable.

22:32.053 --> 22:34.768
Hang on. Anything Tyler
had came from Eddie.

22:34.773 --> 22:36.768
I was just doing what he
said. I'm just the assistant.

22:36.773 --> 22:39.648
But the substance was found in your
house, not the Continuum office.

22:39.653 --> 22:42.208
No, no, anything I had
came from him... Eddie.

22:42.213 --> 22:43.888
So you admit possession.

22:43.893 --> 22:46.128
No, well, it depends...

22:46.133 --> 22:47.888
Okay, these are the facts, Flynn.

22:47.893 --> 22:49.368
The drug that caused Tyler's death

22:49.373 --> 22:51.808
is the same drug that
almost killed Pearl's friend,

22:51.813 --> 22:54.048
and we know that because
Pearl got the drug from you.

22:54.053 --> 22:56.408
- You stole it, you dumb bitch?
- You gave it to Ty?

22:56.413 --> 22:58.208
- I didn't know what the fuck it was!
- (PEARL RANTS)

22:58.213 --> 23:00.368
Hey, hey, hey! Get the fuck off me!

23:00.373 --> 23:01.768
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

23:01.773 --> 23:03.048
Aarggh! Aarggh!

23:03.053 --> 23:05.128
- Get off!
- (CONTINUES RANTING)

23:05.133 --> 23:06.768
- Let go of him now!
- Fuck you!

23:06.773 --> 23:09.008
- Shh. Calm down.
- Come on, get in the car.

23:09.013 --> 23:11.768
So, what happens now? You
lock him up now, right?

23:11.773 --> 23:13.688
It depends what he says,
alright? There's no guarantees.

23:13.693 --> 23:15.128
Well, why not? He killed Ty!

23:15.133 --> 23:18.133
Hey, look, he injected him with
a drug, but that's not illegal.

23:19.853 --> 23:22.888
I mean yes, it caused his death,
but I can't prove intent to kill.

23:22.893 --> 23:24.328
Look, I don't know what
the hell that means.

23:24.333 --> 23:26.008
I just want to know what's
going to happen to Flynn!

23:26.013 --> 23:29.248
Well, maybe nothing in the end, Okay?
We can scare him but not much more.

23:29.253 --> 23:30.608
You're kidding me, right?

23:30.613 --> 23:32.408
He killed my brother
and you can't do a thing.

23:32.413 --> 23:34.808
The only thing we can
really charge him with

23:34.813 --> 23:36.968
is for what he's doing to you.

23:36.973 --> 23:40.488
- Oh, back to that again, huh?
- Yes, it's a crime I can prove.

23:40.493 --> 23:42.408
So, I've gotta dob him in,
that's what you're saying.

23:42.413 --> 23:44.328
Yes.

23:44.333 --> 23:48.288
You've got this big organization
with a national investigation,

23:48.293 --> 23:50.888
which is useless without me
going and crying to the cops.

23:50.893 --> 23:52.413
Listen to me.

23:55.453 --> 23:57.488
I need you to go in
there and make a statement

23:57.493 --> 23:59.973
about the abuse you've
suffered at his hands, alright?

24:02.893 --> 24:05.768
And I will be there
every step of the way.

24:05.773 --> 24:07.573
Okay? I promise.

24:10.333 --> 24:11.973
And that'll get him locked up?

24:13.093 --> 24:15.328
If I report him, he'll go down, then?

24:15.333 --> 24:16.888
Look, our case is really strong,

24:16.893 --> 24:19.933
so in all likelihood,
yes, he'll go to jail.

24:25.773 --> 24:28.088
Okay. Yeah?

24:28.093 --> 24:30.613
Come here. Let's end this, alright?

24:36.133 --> 24:37.808
WOMAN: And can you
tell me your full name?

24:37.813 --> 24:39.368
Pearl Jean Perati.

24:39.373 --> 24:41.408
- Age?
- 15.

24:41.413 --> 24:44.008
How long have you been living
at your current address?

24:44.013 --> 24:45.853
Um, about three weeks.

24:47.173 --> 24:50.688
- And you live with Flynn Pearce?
- Yep.

24:50.693 --> 24:53.648
- How old's he?
- 28.

24:53.653 --> 24:56.653
And you allege that he had
sex with you at that address?

25:18.933 --> 25:20.293
How are you feeling?

25:21.493 --> 25:24.048
So, does Flynn get arrested now?

25:24.053 --> 25:28.448
Yes, he'll be arrested, charged,
and then we'll be given a court date.

25:28.453 --> 25:30.813
- You need me for that?
- Yes.

25:33.053 --> 25:34.688
Do you have any friends,
someone you know,

25:34.693 --> 25:36.493
that you can stay with just for a while?

25:39.773 --> 25:41.173
What about your place?

25:42.933 --> 25:45.328
You've got to have somewhere, right?
You keep saying you want to help me.

25:45.333 --> 25:48.608
- I do want to help you, Pearl.
- Got a spare room, then?

25:48.613 --> 25:50.248
- No, I...
- Sofa?

25:50.253 --> 25:52.088
Look, I've got...

25:52.093 --> 25:53.848
I've got seven-year-old twins, Okay?

25:53.853 --> 25:56.208
So it's not as easy as just saying,
"Hey, come and stay with us."

25:56.213 --> 25:57.848
- Why?
- Well, it's complicated.

25:57.853 --> 25:59.568
You think I'm gonna get 'em pissed?

25:59.573 --> 26:01.573
Steal their teddy bears?

26:02.573 --> 26:04.773
Leave porn up on their
computer or something?

26:07.453 --> 26:09.528
Yeah. Yeah, right. Great.

26:09.533 --> 26:11.288
Listen, Pearl, my kids
are my top priority,

26:11.293 --> 26:13.568
but that doesn't mean I don't want
to find an answer for you, alright?

26:13.573 --> 26:15.768
- What, then?
- It's just not that.

26:15.773 --> 26:17.133
'Cause I got nothin'.

26:18.213 --> 26:21.413
This is me, yeah? This is all I got.

26:22.733 --> 26:24.288
I... I...

26:24.293 --> 26:26.693
I will help you find
somewhere, alright?

26:30.893 --> 26:32.333
I promise you.

26:38.533 --> 26:41.893
Alright, this is just until we
can find somewhere permanent.

26:43.053 --> 26:45.288
In you go.

26:45.293 --> 26:46.693
Cool.

26:48.693 --> 26:53.248
So, this is a serviced apartment,
so it comes with some rules.

26:53.253 --> 26:55.968
Rules? Gonna give me rules?

26:55.973 --> 26:59.088
- Well, I am paying for it.
- So you should.

26:59.093 --> 27:01.253
Okay, let's lose the attitude, please.

27:03.173 --> 27:05.573
Thank you for the place
to stay, Miss King.

27:06.613 --> 27:08.008
I'll be forever grateful

27:08.013 --> 27:11.373
and do exactly what you want
me to so I don't get thrown out.

27:12.493 --> 27:15.808
(LAUGHS) Oh, no, wait,

27:15.813 --> 27:18.253
that's the deal you just
got me out of, isn't it?

27:19.573 --> 27:21.328
People are always wanting to help me out

27:21.333 --> 27:23.253
as long as I do exactly as I'm told.

27:26.333 --> 27:28.008
Tell you what, let's just, um...

27:28.013 --> 27:29.813
let's try and find
some common ground, yeah?

27:32.613 --> 27:34.688
You're here on your own,
in a very safe place,

27:34.693 --> 27:36.213
and you'd like to stay here, yes?

27:37.453 --> 27:40.728
- Yeah.
- Okay, that's good.

27:40.733 --> 27:43.528
Now, some things are going
to make that difficult,

27:43.533 --> 27:46.608
like excessive noise, loud music,
parties, damage to property.

27:46.613 --> 27:48.688
Now, I'm not setting any
terms, I'm not telling you

27:48.693 --> 27:50.528
what you can and can't do,

27:50.533 --> 27:51.768
but I'm just letting you know that

27:51.773 --> 27:53.768
if any of your neighbours
make any complaints,

27:53.773 --> 27:55.728
you won't be able to stay here.

27:55.733 --> 27:56.733
Okay, you understand?

27:58.573 --> 27:59.573
Yeah, alright.

28:03.133 --> 28:04.568
Cool?

28:04.573 --> 28:07.293
(LAUGHS) You don't
say that much, do you?

28:08.933 --> 28:11.008
No.

28:11.013 --> 28:13.848
- Yeah. No, we're cool.
- Great. I've got to get to work.

28:13.853 --> 28:16.373
- We'll speak soon.
- Alright. Yep.

28:22.973 --> 28:24.368
FLYNN: I didn't know what the stuff was.

28:24.373 --> 28:28.128
We just got it delivered and told
that that's what the Devils were on.

28:28.133 --> 28:31.488
Five mils, twice weekly.
I just followed protocol.

28:31.493 --> 28:33.568
- And you never took any home?
- No.

28:33.573 --> 28:36.168
And if that's what Pearl
says, it's bullshit.

28:36.173 --> 28:40.328
I know my rights. And my dad
knows some pretty good lawyers.

28:40.333 --> 28:42.248
And the State Police Commissioner.

28:42.253 --> 28:43.408
Well, I'm with the Feds.

28:43.413 --> 28:45.088
And I don't care who your father knows,

28:45.093 --> 28:46.808
because we've already
got compelling evidence

28:46.813 --> 28:48.568
of at least one count of perjury.

28:48.573 --> 28:51.088
(DEVICE BEEPS)

28:51.093 --> 28:53.413
EDDIE: (ON RECORDING) I need
it now. How much have you got?

28:54.613 --> 28:57.693
FLYNN: 50 mils. I kept
one bottle, that's all.

28:59.693 --> 29:02.648
I've been... I've been bugged?
How long's this been going on for?

29:02.653 --> 29:03.648
TONY: Long enough,

29:03.653 --> 29:06.248
so continuing to lie to us
would not be wise, Mr Pearce.

29:06.253 --> 29:07.408
I need a lawyer.

29:07.413 --> 29:09.768
Request denied under Section 2 of
the National Crimes commission Act.

29:09.773 --> 29:11.448
Well, I'm not answering
any more questions.

29:11.453 --> 29:12.848
Well, I hope you
brought your toothbrush,

29:12.853 --> 29:14.128
because you'll be in custody

29:14.133 --> 29:15.888
until your cooperation
is full and complete.

29:15.893 --> 29:17.848
Okay, alright. That wasn't me.

29:17.853 --> 29:20.688
I mean, that... that was Eddie.

29:20.693 --> 29:22.128
I just did what he said.

29:22.133 --> 29:24.768
- Who else was involved?
- I don't know.

29:24.773 --> 29:26.528
Do you know who asked
Eddie to provide the players

29:26.533 --> 29:27.528
with that supplement?

29:27.533 --> 29:30.048
No, I don't. I don't know
anything. I just work there.

29:30.053 --> 29:32.168
Did you ever suspect that
supplement was being used

29:32.173 --> 29:34.528
to ensure a huge bet on
their performance paid off?

29:34.533 --> 29:37.448
No, I just did my job.
I don't know anything.

29:37.453 --> 29:40.653
Eddie, he's the one
that can tell you stuff.

29:44.413 --> 29:47.493
Hearing of Flynn Pearce
concluded at 2:15pm.

29:48.693 --> 29:51.648
- Okay. Is that... that's it?
- Not quite.

29:51.653 --> 29:53.528
The state police would like a word now.

29:53.533 --> 29:56.128
And once you realise the
totality of what you'll be facing,

29:56.133 --> 29:58.288
you may want to reconsider
some of your answers.

29:58.293 --> 29:59.413
He's all yours.

30:04.613 --> 30:06.368
Was it Eddie who arranged the bets?

30:06.373 --> 30:08.568
And organised the drug program?

30:08.573 --> 30:10.608
I think Maxine's more likely.

30:10.613 --> 30:12.728
Yeah, but is she the big
boss or just one of the gang?

30:12.733 --> 30:15.208
When Flynn comes begging for a
deal on his under age sex matter,

30:15.213 --> 30:16.808
that will be my first question.

30:16.813 --> 30:20.288
Can you do a deal with Flynn? After
promising Pearl he'd go to jail?

30:20.293 --> 30:21.568
That was quick thinking, by the way,

30:21.573 --> 30:23.208
letting her know he was
involved in Tyler's death

30:23.213 --> 30:24.648
so we could get him
charged with something.

30:24.653 --> 30:26.888
Hopefully I don't have to
sacrifice one outcome for the other.

30:26.893 --> 30:29.528
If Nate knows Flynn's about to
do a deal, he should talk first.

30:29.533 --> 30:31.688
Well, the sooner Flynn's in
court, the better, in that case.

30:31.693 --> 30:33.168
Don't give any of them time to think.

30:33.173 --> 30:34.808
Good luck managing that outcome.

30:34.813 --> 30:36.493
Challenge accepted.

30:43.013 --> 30:44.288
OWEN: So, what's all this about?

30:44.293 --> 30:46.408
TONY: I am aware that
due to developments

30:46.413 --> 30:48.528
in one of our references, you
were forced to withdraw charges

30:48.533 --> 30:52.248
over Clay Nelson's death, which
did result in much public criticism.

30:52.253 --> 30:54.368
Well, let me assure you,
confidence in the performance

30:54.373 --> 30:56.408
of the DPP remains at an all-time high.

30:56.413 --> 30:59.608
Well, that's fortunate, because
we've now uncovered evidence

30:59.613 --> 31:01.968
which gives Nate Baldwin
very strong grounds

31:01.973 --> 31:03.768
to appeal his conviction.

31:03.773 --> 31:07.088
What exactly is your definition
of inter-agency cooperation, Tony?

31:07.093 --> 31:09.488
I mean, what, reversing every
decision my office makes?

31:09.493 --> 31:10.888
Oh, no, no, I just
want you to be prepared

31:10.893 --> 31:12.328
to take the running on
this one off the press

31:12.333 --> 31:14.448
and not get caught on the
back foot a second time.

31:14.453 --> 31:16.128
How very generous of you.

31:16.133 --> 31:17.408
Well, think of it as an opportunity

31:17.413 --> 31:20.128
to promote the transparency
and fairness of the DPP.

31:20.133 --> 31:22.328
And if new evidence comes to
light, you act on it quickly,

31:22.333 --> 31:24.768
without obstructing due process.

31:24.773 --> 31:27.608
So, first Janet and now you
telling me how to do my job?

31:27.613 --> 31:29.408
Well, I thought you'd
appreciate the opportunity

31:29.413 --> 31:31.528
to limit any potential
damage to the DPP.

31:31.533 --> 31:33.288
I'm just wondering what
you expect in return

31:33.293 --> 31:34.928
for such a gracious favour,

31:34.933 --> 31:36.568
or are you going to
surprise me and say nothing?

31:36.573 --> 31:37.968
No, no, no, there is something.

31:37.973 --> 31:41.368
If you could accelerate this
matter against Flynn Pearce,

31:41.373 --> 31:45.088
sex with a minor, the NCC
would be extremely grateful.

31:45.093 --> 31:46.528
And the reason you need it accelerated?

31:46.533 --> 31:49.688
- Confidential, of course.
- Of course.

31:49.693 --> 31:51.368
I'm not trying to tell you
how to do your job, Owen,

31:51.373 --> 31:53.488
I'm just trying to work
together as colleagues

31:53.493 --> 31:55.173
in support of the rule of law.

31:59.693 --> 32:02.608
Okay, Flynn Pearce, charged with
sexual intercourse with a child

32:02.613 --> 32:04.928
between the age of 10 and 16.

32:04.933 --> 32:07.968
Since your speciality is
sex crimes, I thought of you.

32:07.973 --> 32:09.928
Mm, one way to earn a reputation.

32:09.933 --> 32:11.848
You probably know the case law on this

32:11.853 --> 32:13.008
better than anyone else here.

32:13.013 --> 32:16.448
- Thank you. Does that mean it's mine?
- I think so.

32:16.453 --> 32:19.848
It's just the NCC seem to have a
particular interest in this case.

32:19.853 --> 32:21.248
Why?

32:21.253 --> 32:23.168
Well, that's what I'm
hoping you can find out.

32:23.173 --> 32:25.368
Look, they're desperate
to have this guy convicted,

32:25.373 --> 32:27.088
so Janet won't be able to help herself.

32:27.093 --> 32:30.048
She'll want to talk to you about it,
tell you how to run the prosecution.

32:30.053 --> 32:32.328
Oh, that's something to look forward to.

32:32.333 --> 32:34.648
I want to know what this
case really means to her.

32:34.653 --> 32:37.168
Actually as flattering as that is,
Janet rarely confides in me, Owen,

32:37.173 --> 32:38.648
so I doubt she's going
to start doing it now.

32:38.653 --> 32:40.368
Well, it depends on how
much she wants this guy,

32:40.373 --> 32:42.208
and how much your charm persuades her

32:42.213 --> 32:44.328
to be more forthcoming with details.

32:44.333 --> 32:46.568
I really don't think she's going
to tell me what you want to hear,

32:46.573 --> 32:48.893
'cause she'll know this
conversation has probably happened.

32:50.493 --> 32:52.253
Still, if you're wrong, let me know.

32:53.413 --> 32:55.368
I'm sure you'll do a
very good job with it.

32:55.373 --> 32:56.613
Thank you.

33:01.053 --> 33:03.048
(PHONE RINGS)

33:03.053 --> 33:05.368
NCC, Bonnie Mahesh speaking.

33:05.373 --> 33:06.488
Bonnie, Owen Mitchell.

33:06.493 --> 33:09.088
Mr Mitchell, hello.

33:09.093 --> 33:10.848
Who did you want to
speak to? Janet, Tony?

33:10.853 --> 33:12.488
Ah, actually you.

33:12.493 --> 33:15.008
Oh. Really?

33:15.013 --> 33:16.568
Yeah, you made some interesting comments

33:16.573 --> 33:18.648
at the Gender Equity
breakfast the other day.

33:18.653 --> 33:20.773
Wouldn't mind hearing
you expand on them.

33:22.133 --> 33:24.288
- Ah, sure. I'd love to.
- Great.

33:24.293 --> 33:25.768
Well, I'm in meetings all afternoon,

33:25.773 --> 33:27.368
but maybe we can meet end of the day?

33:27.373 --> 33:29.408
Yeah, I can do that.

33:29.413 --> 33:31.333
Good. Alright, see you then.

33:33.917 --> 33:35.237
JANET: Your grounds for appeal.

33:36.133 --> 33:37.328
Thanks. Appreciate this.

33:37.333 --> 33:39.088
It's not actually a favour.

33:39.093 --> 33:40.888
I mean, obviously we have
to release any information

33:40.893 --> 33:42.368
relating to wrongful conviction.

33:42.373 --> 33:45.368
However, I'm hoping
you'll do the same for us

33:45.373 --> 33:48.088
with any information
that Nate might tell you.

33:48.093 --> 33:50.168
I doubt he'll tell me anything.

33:50.173 --> 33:52.568
Well, others are very
close to making statements

33:52.573 --> 33:54.048
about the same criminal matter,

33:54.053 --> 33:56.208
so it would be in your client's
best interests to get in first.

33:56.213 --> 33:58.568
Actually, he's not a client anymore.

33:58.573 --> 34:00.693
He sacked me, so I
can't take instruction.

34:01.733 --> 34:04.013
Well, someone has to run
his appeal. It should be you.

34:05.173 --> 34:06.888
- I lost the trial.
- This is straightforward.

34:06.893 --> 34:09.408
- The drug breaks causation, so...
- So anyone can do it.

34:09.413 --> 34:11.288
Well, you know the
case better than anyone.

34:11.293 --> 34:13.408
You owe it to him, Richard.

34:13.413 --> 34:15.128
I do know that.

34:15.132 --> 34:17.172
What's the problem?

34:18.453 --> 34:20.487
I just don't feel comfortable
representing Nate anymore.

34:20.493 --> 34:21.608
Why, because he fired you?

34:21.612 --> 34:23.168
You're going back to him with good news.

34:23.172 --> 34:24.293
Come on, don't be such a sook.

34:26.413 --> 34:28.092
See you at remand tomorrow, then.

34:32.253 --> 34:33.487
What are you doing here?

34:33.493 --> 34:35.527
I assume Richard told you
about the new evidence?

34:35.533 --> 34:37.208
Yes, which means no deals with you.

34:37.213 --> 34:38.973
So if that's what
you're after, forget it.

34:57.693 --> 34:59.048
Check it out. Driver's side.

34:59.053 --> 35:01.528
And it looked pretty
new. No signs of rust.

35:01.533 --> 35:04.093
Let's compare it with
Eddie's car, passenger side.

35:05.693 --> 35:06.848
WAYNE: Yep, that could be a match.

35:06.853 --> 35:08.408
And we know she was furious with Eddie

35:08.413 --> 35:09.768
for not handing over the drug.

35:09.773 --> 35:11.208
But, in fact, that's all we have.

35:11.213 --> 35:13.408
They argued, she got
annoyed, crashed into him.

35:13.413 --> 35:14.728
It doesn't support a serious charge.

35:14.733 --> 35:16.933
Well, let's see if Nate
can tell us more tomorrow.

35:18.533 --> 35:20.048
- Can you take these?
- Yeah.

35:20.053 --> 35:21.968
- Where are you going?
- It's after five.

35:21.973 --> 35:24.968
- I thought you liked overtime.
- Hot date. I'll catch up tomorrow.

35:24.973 --> 35:26.608
I didn't think she ever left this place.

35:26.613 --> 35:28.573
Even an analyst deserves a private life.

35:35.413 --> 35:37.408
BONNIE: I'm glad you thought
my comments were interesting.

35:37.413 --> 35:40.528
Well, they were actually
surprisingly insightful.

35:40.533 --> 35:43.288
I know staffing quotas to address
workplace gender inequality

35:43.293 --> 35:44.768
can seem contentious, but...

35:44.773 --> 35:46.208
Yeah, well, actually, you know what?

35:46.213 --> 35:50.088
I'm more interested in hearing
about how you ended up at the NCC.

35:50.093 --> 35:51.368
They just made me an offer.

35:51.373 --> 35:52.568
Just after I finished my Masters

35:52.573 --> 35:55.128
in Political Science and
International Relations.

35:55.133 --> 35:58.688
Helping address crime on a national
scale sounded really exciting.

35:58.693 --> 36:01.008
So, what does an analyst
actually do? I'm intrigued.

36:01.013 --> 36:02.653
Oh, I've got a range of skills.

36:04.373 --> 36:06.653
I'm very multitalented.
I could talk for ages.

36:08.213 --> 36:11.008
Right, Okay. Let's go and have some
dinner and you can talk some more.

36:11.013 --> 36:13.333
- Awesome. Thanks.
- Hop in.

36:17.413 --> 36:19.568
No, you can't live on chips.

36:19.573 --> 36:20.928
Spaghetti's easy to make, alright?

36:20.933 --> 36:22.848
The directions are on the packet.

36:22.853 --> 36:24.973
Yeah, you turn it over and there's a...

36:26.373 --> 36:28.248
Wow.

36:28.253 --> 36:31.208
Is putting her in an
apartment a good idea?

36:31.213 --> 36:33.408
Well, it's just until I
can think of something else.

36:33.413 --> 36:35.768
This is a much bigger issue
than finding a bed for one girl.

36:35.773 --> 36:40.008
- That isn't going to fix the problem.
- Well, fixes it for her.

36:40.013 --> 36:41.933
And I have to start somewhere, so...

36:43.533 --> 36:44.888
I'm sure you know what you're doing,

36:44.893 --> 36:48.728
but I'm always here to
talk these things through.

36:48.733 --> 36:50.568
Except when you're not.

36:50.573 --> 36:52.328
I have to pick up a change
of clothes occasionally.

36:52.333 --> 36:55.808
Why don't you leave more here?
You know, save you the hassle.

36:55.813 --> 36:57.448
How much more?

36:57.453 --> 37:00.728
Whatever you like. I'm sure I
can make room in my wardrobe.

37:00.733 --> 37:02.768
Is now a good time to mention
that my lease is up for renewal

37:02.773 --> 37:03.773
in a few weeks?

37:06.373 --> 37:07.773
Now's an excellent time.

37:10.293 --> 37:12.208
Why don't you move in?

37:12.213 --> 37:15.688
Hang on, shouldn't we
talk about it first?

37:15.693 --> 37:17.173
We just did.

37:19.493 --> 37:20.853
I love you.

37:22.813 --> 37:24.848
I love you, too.

37:24.853 --> 37:26.208
Alright, kids, dinnertime.

37:26.213 --> 37:27.888
- Yay!
- Set the table.

37:27.893 --> 37:29.968
- Are you sure?
- I'll go get the curry.

37:29.973 --> 37:31.613
Yeah, it's good.

37:33.053 --> 37:35.888
Put that away, can you,
and set some plates?

37:35.893 --> 37:38.568
NATE: The club knew? The bastards!

37:38.573 --> 37:39.968
They said those supplements were safe.

37:39.973 --> 37:42.013
I asked Mitchell a hundred times.

37:43.373 --> 37:45.653
And they said nothin'
and they let me go down.

37:46.853 --> 37:49.288
No, they're going to cop it big
for this. We're suing 'em, Stirlo.

37:49.293 --> 37:50.488
- Technically...
- Look, I didn't...

37:50.493 --> 37:51.768
I didn't mean to sack you, alright?

37:51.773 --> 37:54.253
That was just... It
was heat of the moment.

37:55.533 --> 37:58.248
I trust you, no-one else now.

37:58.253 --> 38:00.048
So, how long before I get out?

38:00.053 --> 38:01.408
I'll lodge the notice of appeal today.

38:01.413 --> 38:04.928
They'll set a date to hear it soon.
It should be pretty straightforward.

38:04.933 --> 38:08.008
(SIGHS)

38:08.013 --> 38:09.608
I guess I ought to say thanks.

38:09.613 --> 38:12.813
All we did was act
appropriately, given the evidence.

38:14.653 --> 38:17.088
Although, I do now have
a couple of questions.

38:17.093 --> 38:19.413
I don't have to say nothin' but, right?

38:20.933 --> 38:21.973
It's entirely up to you.

38:34.093 --> 38:37.493
Look, I wasn't completely
sure what we were on, you know?

38:38.493 --> 38:41.928
I never really... I never really
knew exactly what it was at all.

38:41.933 --> 38:44.653
But you did know about the
four matches that were fixed.

38:49.133 --> 38:52.528
And we know from both your wife's
betting account and your defunct one,

38:52.533 --> 38:54.608
that you've been heavily
involved in illegal gambling

38:54.613 --> 38:55.968
for at least a couple of years.

38:55.973 --> 38:57.128
I wouldn't say heavily.

38:57.133 --> 39:00.733
Not a major player, no, but involved
enough to face serious charges.

39:02.613 --> 39:04.888
Unless you tell us who
those major players are.

39:04.893 --> 39:07.288
So I end up dead, like Oliver Pittman,

39:07.293 --> 39:08.808
or run off the road like Eddie Cooke?

39:08.813 --> 39:13.368
Nate, we know three or four other
minor players, just like you,

39:13.373 --> 39:16.168
but we can only protect the
first person who talks to us.

39:16.173 --> 39:17.653
Do you understand that?

39:21.053 --> 39:22.448
Yep.

39:22.453 --> 39:24.573
So, who told you what to bet on?

39:35.773 --> 39:38.008
Nate, listen to me.

39:38.013 --> 39:40.888
The only way I can guarantee
that you don't end up back in here

39:40.893 --> 39:43.573
is if you're the first
person to say something.

39:44.853 --> 39:47.368
Now, I've already got one other
person of interest in custody,

39:47.373 --> 39:50.813
so please, please just
give me some names.

39:55.293 --> 39:56.613
I can't.

39:57.693 --> 40:00.528
We're talking about very hard people.

40:00.533 --> 40:02.013
I know that.

40:05.773 --> 40:09.853
And I can help you with them if
you just please give me some names.

40:16.133 --> 40:18.053
Please.

40:20.813 --> 40:22.373
Nate.

40:26.613 --> 40:30.968
(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)

40:30.973 --> 40:32.688
(SARCASTICALLY) Thank you for your help.

40:32.693 --> 40:34.608
I doubt that anything I said
would have made a difference.

40:34.613 --> 40:37.253
You know, the Richard I used to
know would have at least tried.

40:46.893 --> 40:48.408
TONY: Mr Cooke, we
now have two witnesses

40:48.413 --> 40:50.568
stating that the drug THX-5

40:50.573 --> 40:52.688
supplied to Northern Devils
players came from you.

40:52.693 --> 40:55.648
- Will you confirm that's true?
- It was all Mitchell Douglas's idea.

40:55.653 --> 40:57.448
How does a football coach
even know about a drug

40:57.453 --> 40:59.448
not yet authorised
for human consumption?

40:59.453 --> 41:01.328
He asked for something
to realise their potential

41:01.333 --> 41:02.728
without testing positive.

41:02.733 --> 41:04.048
And where did you find it?

41:04.053 --> 41:06.408
From a compounding
chemist - Lionel Cartwright.

41:06.413 --> 41:08.688
He imports the ingredients
and makes it up.

41:08.693 --> 41:11.408
Nothing illegal about
that. But how is it ethical?

41:11.413 --> 41:14.408
Administering a drug without knowing
what the side effects could be,

41:14.413 --> 41:16.848
or how it affects various
genetic abnormalities.

41:16.853 --> 41:18.488
But it was working.

41:18.493 --> 41:20.568
I asked Mitchell to tell me
if there were any problems

41:20.573 --> 41:21.568
and he said there weren't.

41:21.573 --> 41:22.728
Why didn't you just tell the club

41:22.733 --> 41:25.448
you were giving them a drug not
cleared for human consumption?

41:25.453 --> 41:27.648
They never asked.

41:27.653 --> 41:30.128
All they said was, "Is
it banned?" And it wasn't.

41:30.133 --> 41:31.648
They never asked why it wasn't banned.

41:31.653 --> 41:33.768
Were you aware of the huge
bets that were being placed

41:33.773 --> 41:35.648
on the Devils performing
well last season?

41:35.653 --> 41:39.248
- I'm not a gambler, I'm a scientist.
- Answer the question, Mr Cooke.

41:39.253 --> 41:40.368
Yes.

41:40.373 --> 41:42.688
- How? Who told you?
- I can't recall.

41:42.693 --> 41:44.928
But it was made very clear what
was at stake and who was behind it?

41:44.933 --> 41:46.048
I can't recall.

41:46.053 --> 41:48.288
Have you bet on the Devils,
or helped fix any matches?

41:48.293 --> 41:51.768
I don't need to fix
matches, I create winners.

41:51.773 --> 41:53.608
That's what people want to see,

41:53.613 --> 41:55.648
high performance athletes
pushing the limits.

41:55.653 --> 41:58.488
And do you accept that
one of those athletes died

41:58.493 --> 42:00.248
as a direct consequence of your program?

42:00.253 --> 42:02.368
She can't attack me like
this. I am highly qualified...

42:02.373 --> 42:03.928
Oh, stop complaining
and answer the question.

42:03.933 --> 42:06.168
Do you acknowledge that
you and your program

42:06.173 --> 42:09.173
were responsible for the
death of Tyler Perati?

42:10.933 --> 42:14.288
This is a closed hearing,
right? None of this is public?

42:14.293 --> 42:16.933
The transcripts are
classified, that's correct.

42:19.373 --> 42:21.093
Yes.

42:22.533 --> 42:24.928
Thank you.

42:24.933 --> 42:26.728
And while the transcripts
are classified,

42:26.733 --> 42:28.128
at the conclusion of this reference,

42:28.133 --> 42:30.533
key findings may be
published at our discretion.

42:31.613 --> 42:34.448
So, I have to forewarn
you that such a disclosure,

42:34.453 --> 42:38.133
in this instance, would have a very
negative impact on your business.

42:40.933 --> 42:44.093
Or we could take into consideration
the extent of your cooperation, so...

42:45.853 --> 42:47.973
in view of that, let me ask you again.

42:49.293 --> 42:53.133
Who made it clear what was at stake,
and who did they say was behind it?

42:58.933 --> 43:00.613
I can't recall.

43:03.693 --> 43:05.208
JANET: Smug bastard.

43:05.213 --> 43:08.528
Is it a crime to supply a drug
not formally approved by the TGA?

43:08.533 --> 43:10.488
Well, not if it isn't
a controlled substance.

43:10.493 --> 43:11.928
It just breaches health regulations.

43:11.933 --> 43:13.968
We can get him for dealing in
steroids with Shannon Hinksman.

43:13.973 --> 43:16.568
- That's illegal.
- Generally considered trivial.

43:16.573 --> 43:19.088
Unless it's part of the organised
crime network behind the gambling.

43:19.093 --> 43:20.608
We can't do anything
until someone talks.

43:20.613 --> 43:23.968
Hey, team. Latest memo from
the world of forensic analysis.

43:23.973 --> 43:28.008
Clay Nelson's mystery visitor, AKA,
also the bagman for Nate Baldwin -

43:28.013 --> 43:31.133
his phone called Maxine's
secret prepay at least 17 times.

43:32.573 --> 43:33.688
And it gets better.

43:33.693 --> 43:36.048
Other numbers to call
Maxine's burner belong to

43:36.053 --> 43:39.133
a fullback for the Griffins and
the captain of the Bull Ants.

43:40.893 --> 43:43.053
They're the teams that lost
to the Devils last season.

43:45.213 --> 43:47.453
Maybe we DON'T need someone to talk.

43:49.573 --> 43:51.768
Nate has to sign a notice
of intention to appeal,

43:51.773 --> 43:53.448
and the CCA only accept new evidence

43:53.453 --> 43:55.448
if ignoring it would lead to
a miscarriage of justice, so...

43:55.453 --> 43:58.088
Oh, shut up, Stirlo. We are celebrating.

43:58.093 --> 43:59.768
Now, crack this open with me, will you?

43:59.773 --> 44:02.968
- It's barely lunchtime.
- Oh, who cares?

44:02.973 --> 44:04.528
You know, I knew you'd sort this.

44:04.533 --> 44:07.928
Nate gets out and
nobody's dobbed on anyone.

44:07.933 --> 44:10.968
God, I feel like a semitrailer
has rolled off my chest.

44:10.973 --> 44:12.368
- Now...
- (POP!)

44:12.373 --> 44:14.048
Ah! Get some glasses. Let's drink up.

44:14.053 --> 44:16.328
Yeah, that's not really been
working out too well for me lately.

44:16.333 --> 44:17.928
Well, it's been working out for me.

44:17.933 --> 44:18.933
(KNOCKS)

44:22.333 --> 44:23.533
Or it was.

44:25.333 --> 44:27.448
TONY: Ms Reynolds, did you know
about the unauthorised nature

44:27.453 --> 44:29.288
of the performance-enhancing drug

44:29.293 --> 44:31.648
Eddie Cooke was giving
the Devils players?

44:31.653 --> 44:33.488
Well, I knew there was
a supplement program.

44:33.493 --> 44:36.048
Did you ask Mr Cooke for
some of that substance?

44:36.053 --> 44:39.408
No, I don't think so. Not
that I can recall, anyway.

44:39.413 --> 44:42.128
Have you recently argued with Mr Cooke?

44:42.133 --> 44:44.648
I argue with everyone. It's
hard to remember specifics.

44:44.653 --> 44:46.048
Where were you the
night of the accident?

44:46.053 --> 44:48.008
I was at home.

44:48.013 --> 44:49.488
In bed, alone.

44:49.493 --> 44:51.133
How did the car get damaged?

44:53.533 --> 44:56.568
God, I don't know. There are
a lot of bad drivers around.

44:56.573 --> 44:59.853
How long did you
represent Clay Nelson for?

45:01.453 --> 45:03.568
Almost 10 years.

45:03.573 --> 45:06.768
- Did you become close in that time?
- Yeah, I guess we did.

45:06.773 --> 45:09.648
Did he ever confide in you
about his money problems?

45:09.653 --> 45:12.168
Well, he'd whinge I
wasn't making him enough,

45:12.173 --> 45:13.648
but all my clients do that.

45:13.653 --> 45:17.048
Were you aware he asked Oliver
Pittman to orchestrate a spot bet?

45:17.053 --> 45:18.328
No, I didn't.

45:18.333 --> 45:20.413
But you were aware he
had a gambling habit.

45:23.013 --> 45:24.328
Well, vaguely.

45:24.333 --> 45:26.248
And you were also aware that
at least two of your clients

45:26.253 --> 45:29.288
were involved in a very large
illegal betting syndicate.

45:29.293 --> 45:30.288
No.

45:30.293 --> 45:31.768
For the past two or three years,

45:31.773 --> 45:33.728
were you telling Clay
and Nate what to bet on?

45:33.733 --> 45:34.768
No.

45:34.773 --> 45:36.688
Did you know that the morning Clay died,

45:36.693 --> 45:39.093
he was about to tell us
who runs that syndicate?

45:41.653 --> 45:43.448
No, I didn't.

45:43.453 --> 45:46.168
Do you believe his
death was an accident?

45:46.173 --> 45:48.448
Yes, it was a terrible accident.

45:48.453 --> 45:49.768
Yes, it was.

45:49.773 --> 45:54.293
One which left his son,
Reed, without a father.

45:55.813 --> 45:59.533
He was a boy you've probably
known from the day he was born.

46:03.613 --> 46:05.413
Was he close to his dad?

46:07.373 --> 46:09.168
(SIGHS)

46:09.173 --> 46:11.168
Yes, they were a great team.

46:11.173 --> 46:13.368
Does he miss him?

46:13.373 --> 46:14.773
Of course he does.

46:17.973 --> 46:19.613
Do you think he'll ever recover?

46:21.453 --> 46:22.853
No, I don't.

46:27.293 --> 46:29.208
Why did that boy lose
a father, Ms Reynolds?

46:29.213 --> 46:30.928
It was an accident.

46:30.933 --> 46:35.208
Why has that boy been left fatherless?

46:35.213 --> 46:37.168
It was bad luck.

46:37.173 --> 46:39.008
Doesn't he deserve to know?

46:39.013 --> 46:40.968
To understand what happened?

46:40.973 --> 46:43.568
Would you rob a child of those answers

46:43.573 --> 46:44.808
for the rest of his life?

46:44.813 --> 46:46.173
What do you want me to say?

46:48.333 --> 46:49.933
It was an accident.

46:55.493 --> 46:56.933
Well, then, who's this man?

46:59.053 --> 47:00.573
(DEVICE BEEPS)

47:02.293 --> 47:04.808
CLAY: (ON RECORDING) I'll
bring you all down with me.

47:04.813 --> 47:06.053
MAN: Careful, Clay.

47:07.133 --> 47:09.973
If you do that, mate,
we're gonna kill your son.

47:11.053 --> 47:13.408
His school looks really nice, Clay.

47:13.413 --> 47:15.453
How dare you threaten me with that?

47:17.333 --> 47:19.293
That's your choice.

47:20.893 --> 47:24.013
So, the only real question you've
gotta ask yourself is this...

47:26.133 --> 47:27.613
who do you love more?

47:29.053 --> 47:32.293
Yourself... or your son?

47:34.053 --> 47:35.053
(DEVICE BEEPS)

47:41.453 --> 47:42.893
TONY: Ms Reynolds?

47:46.573 --> 47:48.053
I don't know.

47:50.253 --> 47:52.208
Well, given the number of
times you've called each other,

47:52.213 --> 47:54.013
we find that unbelievable.

47:56.853 --> 47:59.133
- What's his name?
- I don't know.

48:02.253 --> 48:03.493
I don't.

48:12.533 --> 48:14.168
- BONNIE: Did you break her?
- Not quite.

48:14.173 --> 48:17.013
Oh, damn. In other news, the Devils
are holding a press conference.

48:18.213 --> 48:19.613
Wayne, let's go.

49:15.613 --> 49:18.088
YANNI: The Northern Devils Football
Club is shocked by these allegations

49:18.093 --> 49:20.168
and want to make it perfectly clear,

49:20.173 --> 49:21.848
coach Mitchell Douglas acted alone

49:21.853 --> 49:24.288
in authorising a performance
enhancing drug be given to players.

49:24.293 --> 49:27.488
- It was all Mitchell's idea.
- Convenient.

49:27.493 --> 49:29.888
The club is totally opposed
to the use of such drugs,

49:29.893 --> 49:31.648
and we stand proudly by our record

49:31.653 --> 49:33.288
of never failing an ASADA-approved test.

49:33.293 --> 49:34.808
JOURNALIST: Have the
Devils been penalised?

49:34.813 --> 49:37.128
Mitchell betrayed the faith
and trust we placed in him,

49:37.133 --> 49:39.168
and his contract with the
Northern Devils is terminated,

49:39.173 --> 49:40.368
effective immediately.

49:40.373 --> 49:41.808
- Thank you.
- Who will replace Mitchell?

49:41.813 --> 49:44.368
MITCHELL: Eddie Cooke told me the
boys would get a supplement, Okay?

49:44.373 --> 49:47.408
That's all I knew.
I've told the APL that.

49:47.413 --> 49:48.728
It wasn't my idea.

49:48.733 --> 49:50.968
Eddie said it was
safe, and I trusted him.

49:50.973 --> 49:52.768
He's the scientist, not me.

49:52.773 --> 49:55.648
Is this how the Devils made it to
the semis last year, on this drug?

49:55.653 --> 49:58.048
We got there on bloody hard
work and bloody talented players.

49:58.053 --> 50:00.488
Those boys are my life. I
would never risk their health.

50:00.493 --> 50:02.488
JOURNALIST 1: Mitchell, any
other clubs you know involved?

50:02.493 --> 50:04.208
JOURNALIST 2: Is this
the end for the Devils?

50:04.213 --> 50:06.008
JOURNALIST 3: Have the
reports come back yet?

50:06.013 --> 50:08.208
(REPORTERS CLAMOUR)

50:08.213 --> 50:09.968
Are we recording this? See his car?

50:09.973 --> 50:12.133
We need that last frame blown up.

50:26.333 --> 50:28.208
It was Yanni and Eddie, alright?

50:28.213 --> 50:30.888
I lost my career over something
they organised, not me.

50:30.893 --> 50:33.648
That's not the only reason
you're here, Mr Douglas.

50:33.653 --> 50:36.173
Where were you the night Eddie
Cooke was run off the road?

50:40.013 --> 50:42.608
Ah, I don't remember.

50:42.613 --> 50:45.168
These pictures of you arguing with him,

50:45.173 --> 50:46.813
what was that about?

50:53.173 --> 50:54.608
I don't remember.

50:54.613 --> 50:57.528
Alright, the new scratch on your car

50:57.533 --> 51:00.608
that matches damage and
paint residue on Eddie's car

51:00.613 --> 51:01.933
how do you explain that?

51:11.653 --> 51:14.048
The arsehole.

51:14.053 --> 51:16.848
Giving that shit to my boys.

51:16.853 --> 51:19.888
Ty said he was getting
nosebleeds, bruising.

51:19.893 --> 51:21.888
I spoke to Eddie, but
he said not to worry.

51:21.893 --> 51:23.608
And you were satisfied with that answer?

51:23.613 --> 51:25.453
Tyler died. Hell no.

51:26.813 --> 51:28.328
But Eddie still wouldn't
give me any answers,

51:28.333 --> 51:32.168
so I... followed him home that night.

51:32.173 --> 51:33.773
Thought I'd doorstop him.

51:35.253 --> 51:38.413
But I got so angry, I just... lost it.

51:39.613 --> 51:42.368
Look, I know I should
have asked more questions,

51:42.373 --> 51:46.568
but the results that
we were getting, it's...

51:46.573 --> 51:49.768
When you're riding a wave like
that, no-one wants to get off.

51:49.773 --> 51:51.728
Because you were making
big money gambling on it?

51:51.733 --> 51:54.888
No, no, I would never bet on my
own team. It's against the rules.

51:54.893 --> 51:56.733
So's doping.

52:01.333 --> 52:02.368
Yeah.

52:02.373 --> 52:04.048
Why didn't you ask more
questions about the drug?

52:04.053 --> 52:05.608
Was it because you were in on the bet?

52:05.613 --> 52:07.168
- No.
- Who else was in on it?

52:07.173 --> 52:09.853
- Eddie, Maxine Reynolds...
- I... I don't know.

52:14.253 --> 52:16.053
I didn't ask because, um...

52:22.533 --> 52:24.893
it made me look good, too.

52:28.653 --> 52:30.373
I was the coach everyone wanted.

52:32.373 --> 52:34.128
Eddie swore it was safe

52:34.133 --> 52:36.893
and I would have done anything to
keep the boys playing like that.

52:38.093 --> 52:40.648
I know what it means to win.

52:40.653 --> 52:41.973
I was one of them once.

52:44.013 --> 52:46.133
Winning's like a drug
too, you know? It's...

52:50.373 --> 52:51.773
I let them down.

52:56.533 --> 52:58.053
I let Tyler down.

53:01.013 --> 53:02.493
And he died because of that.

53:11.893 --> 53:14.208
BIANCA: So, the road rage
was Mitchell, not Maxine.

53:14.213 --> 53:16.693
- Yeah, but even so...
- Check this out, sports fans.

53:18.213 --> 53:20.648
One particular call from
Clay Nelson's mystery visitor

53:20.653 --> 53:23.728
went to Maxine's burner the same
day Oliver's wide wasn't called.

53:23.733 --> 53:25.448
And Maxine was at the game, remember?

53:25.453 --> 53:26.448
Interesting.

53:26.453 --> 53:28.733
And even more interesting-ah,
check out the time.

53:30.053 --> 53:32.448
14 seconds before Oliver's wide.

53:32.453 --> 53:34.968
So mystery man's watching the odds,

53:34.973 --> 53:37.488
he called Maxine and
she signalled Oliver.

53:37.493 --> 53:38.688
That's my guess, too.

53:38.693 --> 53:41.453
- We need a warrant.
- Maxine's place. Onto it.

54:01.813 --> 54:03.048
OFFICER 1: Clear!

54:03.053 --> 54:04.328
- Was this door open?
- Yeah.

54:04.333 --> 54:06.688
- OFFICER 2: Clear!
- OFFICER 1: All clear!

54:06.693 --> 54:08.493
OFFICER 2: First floor clear.

-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

54:41.893 --> 54:44.448
If this evidence is confirmed, she's
no longer just linked to this world,

54:44.453 --> 54:45.448
she's directly involved.

54:45.453 --> 54:46.608
So Maxine's dead or guilty.

54:46.613 --> 54:48.408
As Tony says, we follow the money.

54:48.413 --> 54:50.088
Shouldn't be asking
me if I'd be interested

54:50.093 --> 54:52.413
in being involved in match fixing.

54:53.933 --> 54:56.488
No, it wasn't a mugging,
it was a message.

54:56.493 --> 54:59.248
You've always been terrible
at hiding things, Richard.

54:59.253 --> 55:01.088
What have you done, slept with a client?

55:01.093 --> 55:03.248
He was arrested. How does
he have any rights at all?

55:03.253 --> 55:04.808
You've seen how half
of these trials end.

- Why are you pushing so hard?
- She has no-one.
