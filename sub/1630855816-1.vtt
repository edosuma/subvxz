Oh!

00:13.747 --> 00:16.416
What she wants to do
is a little crazy.

00:16.583 --> 00:20.053
Has everybody forgotten that
Carolyn is not a choreographer?

00:20.053 --> 00:22.789
I don't even know if I can do it
and I'm an Olympic medalist.

like you but the chirping,

and the running around

00:53.787 --> 00:55.522
have always been your game.

Welcome to another edition

03:10.990 --> 03:13.026
brought to you by
BROdude Energy.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.627
I'm your host,
Anik Archambault,

03:14.627 --> 03:17.030
along with our panelists,
Tessa Bonhomme,

03:17.030 --> 03:19.432
Jay Onrait, and the man
they call RA.

03:19.432 --> 03:21.834
Mesdames and messieurs,
why save the best for last?

03:21.834 --> 03:23.803
We're leading with these
peckerheads now?

03:23.803 --> 03:25.605
I take it you saw the most
recent installment

03:25.605 --> 03:27.340
of Bulldogs Mic'd Up?

03:27.340 --> 03:29.175
Oui, monsieur.
And here are my personal

03:29.175 --> 03:32.078
highlights from last week's bout
with the hicks from Timmins.

03:32.912 --> 03:34.881
Hey, how'd that corn come in,
Apeldoorn?

03:34.881 --> 03:36.449
She knee-high
by the 4th of July?

03:36.449 --> 03:38.751
Hey, you ever see any crop
circles out there or?

03:38.751 --> 03:40.653
Hey, when you're driving by
a field of cows,

03:40.653 --> 03:42.222
how hard is it to not
just pull over

03:42.222 --> 03:44.924
and rope one of 'em right there?
(Apeldoorn): Fuck you, Shoresy!

03:44.924 --> 03:46.859
There's entertainment value,
I'll give you that.

03:46.859 --> 03:48.628
Tight competition.
But the best stuff comes

03:48.628 --> 03:50.196
when they play Keller
in North Bay.

03:50.196 --> 03:53.433
(Shoresy): Holy fuck, Keller,
did that C get even bigger?

03:53.433 --> 03:54.968
Should sell ads on that thing.

03:54.968 --> 03:56.236
You know what might look nice

03:56.236 --> 03:57.704
is some overhead
lights right here.

03:57.704 --> 04:00.106
Put a missing kid on there,
ya fuckin' loser!

04:00.106 --> 04:01.574
I love those Keller
exchanges too,

04:01.574 --> 04:03.743
but you cannot beat the Soo.

04:03.743 --> 04:05.078
Hey, those visors come
any darker?

04:05.078 --> 04:06.713
I can still kinda see
how fuckin' ugly ya are.

04:06.713 --> 04:09.182
Is there an eclipse tonight?
I can see your old lady

04:09.182 --> 04:11.517
in the stands up there.
You should put one
of those on her.

04:11.517 --> 04:13.286
- Are they still undefeated?
- Shoresy vowed the team

04:13.286 --> 04:14.954
would never lose again.
And well--

04:14.954 --> 04:16.389
They're all losers
in the NOSHO.

04:16.389 --> 04:18.024
After dropping the final game
of the season

04:18.024 --> 04:19.525
to the Soo Cyclones last year,

04:19.525 --> 04:21.027
the Sudbury Blueberry Bulldogs

04:21.027 --> 04:22.528
swept the playoffs
to win the league.

04:22.528 --> 04:24.364
Damn shame the National
Senior Tournament

04:24.364 --> 04:26.399
was cancelled.
They were on a heater!

04:26.399 --> 04:27.800
- They still are.
- You bet, Tessa!

04:27.800 --> 04:30.603
The Bulldogs are on a 20-game
win streak this year,

04:30.603 --> 04:33.773
looking to win the final four
contest for a perfect season.

04:33.773 --> 04:35.408
Never done before in the NOSHO.

04:35.408 --> 04:36.976
They've got
the whole team buzzin'

04:36.976 --> 04:39.112
but big individual efforts, too.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.680
Michaels is the best goalie
in the NOSHO,

04:40.680 --> 04:43.516
and JJ Frankie JJ
leads the league in goals!

04:43.516 --> 04:46.152
- Frankie's on top of the world.
- Yeah, but they've got the new

04:46.152 --> 04:49.355
American expansion team twice
and they're a handful.

04:49.355 --> 04:51.891
You know, only in the NOSHO
could there exist two teams

04:51.891 --> 04:54.027
from the Soo. Soo, Ontario,

04:54.027 --> 04:55.928
and then, I didn't even
know there was--

04:55.928 --> 04:57.864
- Soo, Michigan, baby.
- Yes, the NOSHO

04:57.864 --> 05:00.333
- is now a five-team league.
- Yeah, but here's the problem,

05:00.333 --> 05:02.735
they've spent the entire season
humiliating the rest

05:02.735 --> 05:04.037
of the league on the internet.

05:04.037 --> 05:05.905
They're putting a giant
target on their back.

05:05.905 --> 05:07.240
(crowd cheering)

05:07.240 --> 05:08.474
(Anik): Four games left
on the campaign,

05:08.474 --> 05:11.477
Timmins, North Bay,
Soo Michigan at home,

05:11.477 --> 05:13.446
then Soo Michigan
again stateside.

05:13.446 --> 05:15.682
(Jay): You know they're all
dying to spoil this

05:15.682 --> 05:16.683
for the Bulldogs.

05:16.683 --> 05:17.984
They've got bigger problems.

05:17.984 --> 05:19.452
Not to sound like
the Bobfather here

05:19.452 --> 05:21.187
but you think Shoresy
was bad last year

05:21.187 --> 05:22.355
trying to get them
outta the bottom.

05:22.355 --> 05:23.823
- Yes.
- I'm hearin' he's way worse

05:23.823 --> 05:25.291
this year tryin' to keep 'em
at the top.

05:25.291 --> 05:27.293
Whatever he's doin',
it's workin'.

05:27.293 --> 05:29.329
No one can pass the Bulldogs
for first place this year.

05:29.329 --> 05:32.098
They've got it locked up.
But with four games remaining

05:32.098 --> 05:34.901
and four wins away from
a record-breaking season,

05:34.901 --> 05:36.235
it's up to the Bulldogs.

05:36.235 --> 05:38.971
They can be the best team
in the league this year,

05:38.971 --> 05:41.574
or they can be the best team
in the league, ever.

05:41.574 --> 05:44.177
Sure, Anik.
What could go wrong?

05:44.177 --> 05:46.346
(Shoresy): We're hammerin'
too much ass.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.715
- That's why we're here.
- Well, not me.

05:48.715 --> 05:51.317
- I know.
- Too many distractions,

05:51.317 --> 05:53.753
Shoresy.
Priority is a perfect season.

05:53.753 --> 05:56.222
Seriously, Nat, I want that
fuckin' record but like--

05:56.222 --> 05:57.690
I've got my priorities straight.

05:57.690 --> 05:59.492
- Sanger, don't be a pussy.
- But what, slut?

05:59.492 --> 06:01.294
But like, the boys
are right up against it.

06:01.294 --> 06:02.595
- Why?
- Well, one, we're on

06:02.595 --> 06:04.097
- a 20-game heater.
- And two?

06:04.097 --> 06:05.231
There's an impossible amount

06:05.231 --> 06:06.999
of good-looking girls
in Sudbury.

06:06.999 --> 06:09.335
(sultry music plays)

06:14.574 --> 06:15.575
(speaking French)

06:15.575 --> 06:17.176
Too bad all the dudes
are ugly, though.

06:17.176 --> 06:19.045
I was just gonna say, Ziig,
your hair looks legit

06:19.045 --> 06:20.513
- good like that.
- Yeah?

06:20.513 --> 06:22.715
But I still think way
more dudes'd be into me.

06:22.715 --> 06:25.451
- Guilty.
- Sanger... don't be a pussy.

06:25.451 --> 06:26.853
She's my girlfriend, my guy.

06:26.853 --> 06:29.088
Yeah, but ya don't gotta
be like... kee-he-he-he!

06:29.088 --> 06:31.224
I asked you to raise
your game last year.

06:31.224 --> 06:32.692
- Me?
- Oh, my God.

06:32.692 --> 06:34.394
You started working hard
away from the rink,

06:34.394 --> 06:36.829
throwing some weights around,
and I will give it to you, man,

06:36.829 --> 06:39.132
- you got jacked.
- It's the least I can do, Nat.

06:39.132 --> 06:41.501
Seriously, thank you so much for...

06:42.835 --> 06:44.203
keepin' the team goin'.

06:44.203 --> 06:45.805
Tuck in your fuckin'
tampon string.

06:45.805 --> 06:47.940
You answered the call.
But then, you went above

06:47.940 --> 06:49.909
and beyond the call
and you got the rest of the team

06:49.909 --> 06:51.778
- jacked with you.
- What's good for the goose.

06:51.778 --> 06:53.112
Which brings us
to the problem

06:53.112 --> 06:55.481
- of my own manufacturing.
- Hammerin' too much ass?

06:55.481 --> 06:56.949
- Yeah--
- Huh?

06:56.949 --> 06:58.317
They're top of the league,
defending champs,

06:58.317 --> 07:01.154
20-game heater, and they're
the most jacked team

07:01.154 --> 07:03.189
in the NOSHO. Can you imagine?

07:03.189 --> 07:05.625
Trust me, you can't.

07:12.165 --> 07:15.134
(rap music plays)

07:25.244 --> 07:27.313
Got more ass than Kellogg's
got Corn Flakes.

07:27.313 --> 07:29.816
I can't help but feel
entirely responsible.

07:29.816 --> 07:31.083
- You are.
- You think?

07:31.083 --> 07:34.487
Well... if you don't want
the boys in snapper,

07:34.487 --> 07:37.990
definitely don't make us do
a calendar of sexy photos.

07:37.990 --> 07:39.625
- You're right.
- You're an idiot.

07:39.625 --> 07:41.461
I can't believe you got
'em to do that shit.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.396
That calendar's gonna bite us
in the ass one day, Nat.

07:43.396 --> 07:45.498
You look like such a fucking
goof in that thing, Shoresy.

07:45.498 --> 07:47.900
Ziig, you got a voice
that goes up one side of me

07:47.900 --> 07:49.969
- and right down the other.
- I've got a voice?

07:49.969 --> 07:51.938
Yeah, and a face
that makes me go, ah!

07:51.938 --> 07:53.973
The money from the calendars
will help fund our bid

07:53.973 --> 07:56.108
to host the National
Senior Tournament.

07:56.108 --> 07:57.910
It won't get cancelled
again now.

07:57.910 --> 08:00.112
- Brilliant move, ladies.
- Kee-he-he-he!

08:00.112 --> 08:01.981
(Nat): What's good
for the goose.

08:01.981 --> 08:03.382
Four games left
for a perfect season.

08:03.382 --> 08:05.718
- Keep the boys focused, slut.
- I want that record.

08:05.718 --> 08:07.420
Make sure they get the message.

08:07.420 --> 08:09.155
That you want the record?

08:09.155 --> 08:10.490
The other one.

08:11.090 --> 08:13.192
(Shoresy): You're hammerin'
too much ass.

08:13.726 --> 08:14.994
Well, I was more
talkin' to Goody.

08:14.994 --> 08:16.629
- Mkay.
- Dolo, you're hammerin'

08:16.629 --> 08:18.231
- way too much ass.
- Settle down.

08:18.231 --> 08:19.699
What am I, chopped liver?

08:19.699 --> 08:21.334
Well, they wheeled
more than you.

08:21.334 --> 08:22.668
You're some crooked
aren't ya, b'y?

08:22.668 --> 08:23.669
You ever have foie gras?

08:23.669 --> 08:25.538
Yeah, like Dolo
wheeled the most.

08:25.905 --> 08:28.241
- Goody's second.
- No, foie gras.

08:28.241 --> 08:29.675
And then, you well in third.

08:29.675 --> 08:30.910
B'ys, he's right
rotted, he is.

08:30.910 --> 08:32.178
I'm not saying you're ugly,

08:32.178 --> 08:33.546
Hitch. That's not
what I'm sayin'.

08:33.546 --> 08:35.147
- Charitable of ya, me son.
- I'm just sayin'

08:35.147 --> 08:37.016
- you're the ugliest here.
- Lard Jeezus!

08:37.016 --> 08:38.317
- You got a dip?
- Bethany?

08:38.317 --> 08:39.886
- (Bethany): Yeah?
- Join us out

08:39.886 --> 08:41.354
where we're to, please?

08:41.354 --> 08:43.055
(footsteps approaching)

08:43.055 --> 08:45.091
Bethany Dawn.

08:45.091 --> 08:47.059
Isn't it cute how
he calls me by my full name?

08:47.059 --> 08:49.929
If we're becomin' one,
I do ya the courtesy.

08:49.929 --> 08:51.297
Well, I only know
your nickname.

08:51.297 --> 08:52.965
Well, his full name's
Ted Hitchcock.

08:52.965 --> 08:55.601
- It's kinda funny 'cause when--
- Who's the ugliest

08:55.601 --> 08:57.270
outta the b'ys here
where we're to?

08:57.270 --> 08:58.271
Shoresy.

08:58.271 --> 08:59.906
Now, go on in
out of it, me son.

08:59.906 --> 09:01.541
- Sorry.
- Yeah, don't worry about it.

09:02.408 --> 09:04.810
- What's that, old man?
- Should be two outta three.

09:08.915 --> 09:10.616
Let's get on the go!

09:10.616 --> 09:12.151
Melodie?

09:15.221 --> 09:16.689
- Ooh.
- We got a nail-biter.

09:16.689 --> 09:18.691
(Britt): Shoresy is
the ugliest guy here.

09:18.691 --> 09:20.626
All right, now we're out
the other end of 'er.

09:20.626 --> 09:23.663
- (loud belch)
- Oh... Frankie is here.

09:23.663 --> 09:25.164
(Big Sexy): Tit fucker.
(Britt): Frankie's here?

09:25.164 --> 09:26.599
Yeah, why do you think
it smells like

09:26.599 --> 09:28.200
spaghetti carbonara?
(Big Sexy): Tit fucker.

09:28.200 --> 09:30.903
Let's get some fuckin'
tandoori barbecue kebabs.

09:30.903 --> 09:32.572
I dunno about that
Quebecer b'y.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.073
Last year left us
in a real pickle

09:34.073 --> 09:36.509
chasin' Laurence Leboeuf
back to Quebec.

09:36.509 --> 09:38.244
- Laurence Leboeuf?
- Laurence Leboeuf?

09:38.244 --> 09:40.479
- Well, would you chase 'er?
- Yes, b'y. You?

09:40.479 --> 09:41.948
Was a bit young but...

09:43.749 --> 09:45.051
You're still
the ugliest, Shoresy.

09:45.051 --> 09:46.352
I don't care.

09:46.352 --> 09:47.820
(Nat): I think he looks
pretty good.

09:47.820 --> 09:49.221
(Miig): Girl, no you don't.

09:49.221 --> 09:52.825
(Nat): Yeah, too much Bailey's
in my coffee this morning.

09:52.825 --> 09:54.660
(Ziig): Just can't believe
you got them to do this shit.

09:54.660 --> 09:55.895
(Nat): Ask
and you shall receive.

09:55.895 --> 09:57.396
(Ziig): They knew how much
ass would follow.

09:57.396 --> 09:59.098
(Miig): Bingo.
(Ziig): Got us to 50% full.

09:59.098 --> 10:00.633
(Nat): Bums in seats, baby.

10:00.633 --> 10:02.234
(Miig): Impressive numbers
for senior hockey.

10:02.234 --> 10:04.437
(Nat): But 50 ain't 75.

10:05.004 --> 10:06.272
Has Michaels been acting weird?

10:06.272 --> 10:08.240
(Ziig): Goalies are
always weird.

10:10.543 --> 10:13.346
(Nat): The Wolves get so many
kids out to the games.

10:13.346 --> 10:16.382
I love seeing that. We need
to get more kids to the rink.

10:16.382 --> 10:17.984
(Miig): Kids in sports
stay off the streets.

10:17.984 --> 10:20.519
(Ziig): Drugs kill dreams.

10:20.519 --> 10:22.355
(Nat): Yeah.

10:22.355 --> 10:24.757
Let's focus on the youth, ladies.

10:25.758 --> 10:28.728
(Ziig): Could fucking puke. Ugly.

10:28.728 --> 10:30.463
(Shoresy): The good thing about
the calendars

10:30.463 --> 10:32.598
is that none of us
looked too ugly.

10:35.134 --> 10:36.402
Sure, we're all in top shape,
b'ys.

10:36.402 --> 10:37.670
Why not put it up
on a calendar?

10:37.670 --> 10:39.105
Yeah, like the calendars'll
always be there

10:39.105 --> 10:41.207
to remind us of a time
we weren't too ugly.

10:41.207 --> 10:43.109
One day we'll wish
we're still lookin' so good

10:43.109 --> 10:44.543
- as what we did.
- Settle down.

10:44.543 --> 10:47.947
But it's kinda funny.
It's like, I come in,

10:47.947 --> 10:49.448
I take my tarp off,

10:49.448 --> 10:51.417
and then, we had to take
all your pictures again

10:51.417 --> 10:53.185
because you didn't
have your tarps off.

10:53.185 --> 10:54.754
Didn't think of it, old man.

10:56.055 --> 10:58.391
Well, if I'm a broad lookin'
at a sexy calendar of dudes,

10:58.391 --> 11:00.426
I'm probably hopin'
they have their tarps off.

11:00.426 --> 11:02.795
Too hand to the game time
for a Martoonie, eh, me son?

11:02.795 --> 11:04.930
Those calendars are gonna
bite us in the ass one day,

11:04.930 --> 11:07.667
boys. All right,
who wants more?

11:07.667 --> 11:10.870
One, two, three, four,
fuckin' 500 probably.

11:10.870 --> 11:12.304
(Big Sexy): Tit fucker!

11:12.304 --> 11:14.140
(arena organ plays)

11:14.140 --> 11:16.375
(Hitch): Didn't think
of the grease downs
either, old man.

11:18.110 --> 11:20.346
Hey, we got eight Apeldoorn's
on deck here, gents.

11:20.346 --> 11:21.547
Let's get focused here now.

11:21.547 --> 11:23.282
First time I've been
in a room wit a dozen

11:23.282 --> 11:26.185
or more greased up dudes, b'ys,
and might not be the last.

11:28.354 --> 11:30.756
Well, if I'm a broad lookin'
at a calendar of sexy dudes

11:30.756 --> 11:32.391
with their tarps off,
I'm probably hopin'

11:32.391 --> 11:34.160
- they're greased down too.
- Les Jims.

11:34.160 --> 11:35.227
Oh, is that the Jims?

11:35.227 --> 11:36.395
- (Jim 1): Yeah.
- Hey, Jim.

11:36.395 --> 11:37.396
- (Jim 2): Hello.
- Jim.

11:37.396 --> 11:38.464
(Jim 3): Sorry we're late, Shoresy.

11:38.464 --> 11:39.765
We were playing
Reach For The Top.

11:39.765 --> 11:41.534
All the b'ys with
the spray tans too, look.

11:41.534 --> 11:42.835
Well, Dolo didn't get one.

11:42.835 --> 11:44.603
For obvious reasons. Eh, Dolo?

11:44.603 --> 11:46.605
It's pretty obvious why
you didn't get one, eh?

11:46.605 --> 11:47.873
And ain't it sum'in.

11:47.873 --> 11:49.575
The Jims didn't lift
a single weight,

11:49.575 --> 11:51.510
kept der tarps
on the entire time,

11:51.510 --> 11:53.713
and still might be d'most
popular of all the b'ys.

11:53.713 --> 11:55.114
Now see, that idea
was all me,

11:55.114 --> 11:56.649
but how 'bout a little
focusin' here, boys?

11:56.649 --> 11:58.751
- Let's get focused in here now.
- Wait, are we talkin' about

11:58.751 --> 12:00.553
puttin' them in their
jail guard uniforms?

12:00.553 --> 12:02.221
Oh, see Hitch,

12:02.221 --> 12:05.257
Fish would be the ugliest guy
in this room.

12:05.925 --> 12:08.227
Be a lot less ugly if you were
still scorin' a goal a game.

12:08.227 --> 12:09.595
You know, I think
the uniforms gave--

12:09.595 --> 12:11.530
Shut the fuck up, Michaels.

12:12.131 --> 12:13.866
- (loud fart)
- Well, like, if I'm a broad

12:13.866 --> 12:15.935
looking at a sexy calendar
of greased-down dudes

12:15.935 --> 12:18.537
with their tarps off, I for sure
wouldn't mind a few rugged men

12:18.537 --> 12:20.339
- in uniform sauced in there.
- Settle down.

12:20.339 --> 12:21.974
Fuckin' bak'er right
into the cake, eh Jim?

12:21.974 --> 12:22.942
- Yeah.
- Jim?

12:22.942 --> 12:24.276
- Yes.
- Jim?

12:24.276 --> 12:25.711
Traditionally, men in uniform
do pretty well

12:25.711 --> 12:27.279
with broads,
but you should still ask them

12:27.279 --> 12:28.781
how they're doing
the odd time, too.

12:28.781 --> 12:30.616
(Shoresy): Big warm-up here,
boys!

12:30.616 --> 12:31.951
Let's get the blood
flowin' here now!

12:31.951 --> 12:33.385
(Dolo): Hey, Jim.
(Jim 1): Yeah.

12:33.385 --> 12:34.520
Jim.
(Jim 2): Hello.

12:34.520 --> 12:35.688
- Jim.
- What's up, Dolo?

12:35.688 --> 12:37.056
What's goin' on, buddy?

12:37.590 --> 12:38.791
(Michaels): Trivia.
It's like a trivia--

12:38.791 --> 12:39.992
(Shoresy): Shut the fuck up, Michaels.

12:39.992 --> 12:41.560
We run a trivia league
at the jail, bro.

12:41.560 --> 12:43.362
(Shoresy): Mental game starts
in warm-up here, boys.

12:43.362 --> 12:45.297
Let's go now.
(Hitch): But ya calls it

12:45.297 --> 12:46.665
- Reach For De Top?
- Yeah.

12:46.665 --> 12:49.001
Reach For The Top's
an old Canadian TV game show.

12:49.001 --> 12:50.569
But now it's just mostly
run out of high schools.

12:50.569 --> 12:53.472
(Fish): And you run it outta
the jail, like with the inmates?

12:53.472 --> 12:54.874
(Shoresy): No, with
the mouses, Fish.

12:54.874 --> 12:56.475
Yeah, in teams of four.
The inmates compete

12:56.475 --> 12:58.277
against each other but we also
have a team of four.

12:58.277 --> 13:00.546
- (Michaels): Who's your fourth?
- Timmins Timber Kings, boys!

13:00.546 --> 13:02.314
Let's get that fuckin' record!

13:03.415 --> 13:05.484
Are you rolling?

13:05.484 --> 13:06.986
Cory, are you rolling?

13:06.986 --> 13:08.521
Shoresy will get going
before warm-up

13:08.521 --> 13:10.356
so you should always be
rolling when they hit the ice.

13:10.356 --> 13:12.024
Actually, start rolling when
they're in the tunnel even.

13:12.024 --> 13:14.627
- I'm rolling.
- You know, if you clip

13:14.627 --> 13:17.763
your walkie mic to your shoulder
you can get to it a lot quicker.

13:17.763 --> 13:19.231
You see how I got mine?

13:19.231 --> 13:21.100
(Cory): I'm not doing that.

13:21.734 --> 13:23.469
- Why not?
- 'Cause I've never seen a guy

13:23.469 --> 13:24.703
with a walkie clipped
to his shoulder

13:24.703 --> 13:26.605
gettin' his dink sucked.
(walkie beeps)

13:26.605 --> 13:28.374
Found your way outta
the corn maze, eh Apeldoorn,

13:28.374 --> 13:30.876
- ya fuckin' loser?
- Comin' for that streak, bud!

13:30.876 --> 13:34.079
Hey, Bill Gates buying up
farmland around you guys too or?

13:34.079 --> 13:36.348
Wearing number 8
for the Timmins Timber Kings,

13:36.348 --> 13:39.385
Mervin Emmanual Moses.
What a moment for this young man

13:39.385 --> 13:42.321
as it is no doubt the greatest
moment of his entire life.

13:42.321 --> 13:44.924
Hey, which one are you?
Fuckin' Elmer Isaac Ezekiel?

13:44.924 --> 13:46.492
- (Apeldoorn): You're dead.
- You're dead.

13:46.492 --> 13:48.694
- No, I'm-I'm gonna kill ya.
- I'm gonna kill you.

13:48.694 --> 13:50.429
I'm serious, I'll fuckin'
kill ya, Shoresy.

13:50.429 --> 13:52.364
All right, first shift,
we kill each other.

13:52.364 --> 13:54.867
- 20-game heater, ladies.
- Let's go, 21.

13:54.867 --> 13:56.268
The eldest Apeldoorn's
been fighting everyone

13:56.268 --> 13:58.737
- on the home stretch.
- We'll play any way you want.

13:58.737 --> 14:01.040
The luxury of having a full
squad of guys who will go.

14:01.040 --> 14:03.776
The only real fight's between
our team to see who gets him.

14:03.776 --> 14:06.879
- Well, not all of them will go.
- True.

14:06.879 --> 14:09.081
Yeah, but the one who won't
will spear you in the face

14:09.081 --> 14:10.449
before you get your mitts off.

14:10.449 --> 14:11.617
(Sanguinet): Shoresy, you ready?

14:11.617 --> 14:13.352
Give your balls a tug,
tit fucker.

14:13.352 --> 14:14.787
You're goin'!
(Team): Yaa-hoo!

14:14.787 --> 14:16.455
(Sanguinet): Frankie, you ready?
(Frankie belches)

14:16.455 --> 14:18.257
You're goin'!
(Team): Yaa-hoo!

14:18.257 --> 14:20.392
- Goody, you ready?
- Let's fuckin' go, Sanger.

14:20.392 --> 14:22.294
Good 'cause you're goin'!
(Team): Yaa-hoo!

14:22.294 --> 14:24.597
- Hitch, you ready?
- All hands, b'ys!

14:24.597 --> 14:26.332
Good 'cause you're goin'!
(Team): Yaa-hoo!

14:26.332 --> 14:28.467
Dolo, run 'em up
and fill 'em in?

14:29.201 --> 14:30.436
Good 'cause you're
fuckin' goin!

14:30.436 --> 14:32.404
- (Team): Yaa-hoo!
- The best goalie in the NOSHO,

14:32.404 --> 14:34.306
- Michaels, are you ready?
- You're damn right, Sanger!

14:34.306 --> 14:35.708
Good, 'cause you're
fuckin' goin'!

14:35.708 --> 14:38.477
- (Team): Yaa-hoo!
- Pack mentality, boys!

14:40.446 --> 14:43.249
(electronic music plays)

15:07.106 --> 15:10.276
(music intensifies)

15:24.256 --> 15:26.792
(crowd cheers and boos)

15:35.367 --> 15:36.502
(crowd cheers)

15:36.502 --> 15:38.337
(Shoresy): Who's gonna set
the tone, boys?

15:38.337 --> 15:39.605
Who's gonna fuckin' set it?!

15:39.605 --> 15:41.373
(crowd cheering)

15:41.373 --> 15:43.876
(players shouting indistinctly)

15:46.946 --> 15:48.714
(players): Yeah!

15:52.785 --> 15:54.787
(crowd cheers loudly)

15:57.823 --> 15:59.591
(horn buzzes)

16:01.260 --> 16:02.528
Another goose egg
for Michaels.

16:02.528 --> 16:03.696
Best goalie in the league.

16:03.696 --> 16:05.230
He has been acting
weird though.

16:05.230 --> 16:06.665
Goalies are always weird.

16:07.766 --> 16:09.635
- What?
- Listen.

16:09.635 --> 16:11.070
(indistinct shouting)

16:11.070 --> 16:12.471
(Shoresy): Fuck's sake!

16:12.471 --> 16:14.640
We thought he was bad trying
to get us outta the bottom.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.709
He is way worse trying
to keep us at the top.

16:16.709 --> 16:19.979
(indistinct shouting)

16:20.346 --> 16:21.714
(Drumstick clunks)
You wanna chit-chat

16:21.714 --> 16:23.048
with Apeldoorn between plays?

16:23.048 --> 16:25.150
Go fuck him up the ass
and get it over with!

16:25.150 --> 16:28.387
We only get fuckin' two
on the Timmins Timber Kings?

16:28.387 --> 16:30.556
Half these guys worked
a fuckin' 12-hour shift.

16:30.556 --> 16:31.623
We only get fuckin' two?

16:31.623 --> 16:33.258
We've got the fuckin'
Yanks next week.

16:33.258 --> 16:35.094
We have the fuckin'
Yanks next week!

16:35.094 --> 16:36.729
Bet they're over there
with a bag of trans fats

16:36.729 --> 16:39.264
havin' a good fuckin'
laugh at us. Hey!

16:39.264 --> 16:40.766
You only get a stick
if you played

16:40.766 --> 16:43.102
more than five minutes.
(Drumsticks clattering)

16:43.102 --> 16:45.004
The useless don't get a stick

16:45.004 --> 16:47.339
'cause the rest of ya can only
get two fuckin' tucks.

16:47.339 --> 16:50.175
Fish! You used a get
a goal a fuckin' game.

16:50.175 --> 16:52.444
- How many'd ya get tonight? Huh?
- Zero.

16:52.444 --> 16:55.214
- And the game before that?
- Zero.

16:55.214 --> 16:56.615
- And the game before that?
- Zero!

16:56.615 --> 16:58.784
- You don't get one either!
- But they didn't get any.

16:58.784 --> 17:00.285
Yeah, if it weren't
for fuckin' Michaels,

17:00.285 --> 17:01.954
the streak'd be over.
(Michaels): Thank you, Shoresy.

17:01.954 --> 17:03.589
- Shut the fuck up, Michaels!
- Two-nothing lead's

17:03.589 --> 17:05.691
- the worst lead in hockey.
- And quit playin' the puck

17:05.691 --> 17:07.559
so much. Think you're
fuckin' Marty Turco?

17:07.559 --> 17:09.528
(Drumstick clatters)

17:09.528 --> 17:12.264
We were flat
as my grade 4 girlfriend

17:12.264 --> 17:13.766
before Jim stepped in.

17:13.766 --> 17:15.467
Thanks, Shoresy.
I think any one of these guys

17:15.467 --> 17:16.969
- would have done the same--
- Thanks, Jim!

17:16.969 --> 17:19.805
What happened to "They don't
ask how, they ask how many?"

17:19.805 --> 17:21.573
- I'm asking how many!
- He's asking how many!

17:21.573 --> 17:23.442
- I'm asking how many!
- He's fucking asking how many!

17:23.442 --> 17:25.210
- Two isn't fuckin' enough!
- Yeah!

17:30.649 --> 17:33.986
(rap music plays)

17:55.074 --> 17:56.775
(Nat): Is he all right?
(Miig): He's acting weird.

17:56.775 --> 17:58.210
(Ziig): Goalies
are always weird.

17:58.210 --> 17:59.511
Two goals on Timmins?

17:59.511 --> 18:01.346
I swear, if Frankie
wasn't tucking two a game--

18:01.346 --> 18:04.450
- Frankie's on top of the world.
- Look at them.

18:05.117 --> 18:06.518
No wonder they have
no legs in the third.

18:06.518 --> 18:08.353
(Miig): They already played
a period between the sheets.

18:08.353 --> 18:09.688
(Ziig): Perks of being
number one.

18:09.688 --> 18:10.923
Too many distractions.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.024
Shoresy's on it.

18:12.024 --> 18:13.492
You know he wants
that fucking record, Nat.

18:13.492 --> 18:15.594
- (Miig laughs)
- Look at you!

18:15.594 --> 18:16.762
Go home, you're drunk.

18:16.762 --> 18:18.697
Okay, Shoresy
is a dumb, ugly slut.

18:18.697 --> 18:20.766
- Okay, she's back.
- Dumbest, ugliest slut

18:20.766 --> 18:22.668
- we've got maybe.
- I knew she was still in there.

18:22.668 --> 18:25.003
But that dude commits.

18:25.003 --> 18:27.573
(indistinct chatter)

18:27.573 --> 18:29.708
(Miig): Loves to win.

18:29.708 --> 18:31.009
(Nat): Hates to lose.

18:31.009 --> 18:33.212
(Ziig): Doesn't matter how long
it takes to get it.

18:33.212 --> 18:36.148
If he wants it, he'll work.

18:37.716 --> 18:39.418
Guess the rest of them
just have to decide.

18:39.418 --> 18:42.488
Yeah. Do they wanna be
the best team in the league

18:42.488 --> 18:44.156
this year, or do they wanna be

18:44.156 --> 18:46.158
the best team
in the league ever?

18:46.158 --> 18:48.994
- Better decide quick.
- Mm-hmm.

18:50.462 --> 18:52.097
'Cause they're comin'.

18:52.097 --> 18:54.399
(music intensifies)
