WEBVTT

01:21.514 --> 01:22.708
It's me.

01:24.384 --> 01:26.147
Everything all right?

01:28.455 --> 01:32.016
What do you mean they're gone?
You mean, she's gone, too?

01:34.828 --> 01:37.456
I'll be waiting in front of the hotel.

03:42.255 --> 03:45.247
Who could have guessed
a thing like that, sir?

03:45.525 --> 03:48.824
When he got down into the street,
it was still dark.

03:49.095 --> 03:51.825
Then the front door opened again,
and she came out, too.

03:51.931 --> 03:55.059
I thought she must have
come down to say goodbye to him.

03:55.168 --> 03:57.068
Instead, she opens the door of the car,

03:57.170 --> 04:00.537
makes the dog get in, gets in herself,
and they're off.

04:00.640 --> 04:02.540
Aren't you listening, Dottore?

04:02.642 --> 04:04.337
Yes. Yes.

04:05.378 --> 04:07.744
Damn it. This is something
we didn't want. Anyway,

04:07.847 --> 04:11.613
as far as I'm concerned,
I followed the instructions.

04:19.425 --> 04:20.983
You've made up your mind?

04:21.094 --> 04:23.358
What do you think marriage
will get you?

04:23.463 --> 04:26.796
I don't know.
The impression of normalcy.

04:28.034 --> 04:31.697
-Normalcy.
-Yes. Stability, security.

04:31.804 --> 04:35.865
In the morning when I'm dressing
in the mirror I see myself.

04:35.975 --> 04:39.035
And compared to everyone else,
I feel I'm different.

04:39.145 --> 04:41.477
What do you see in Giulia?

04:41.581 --> 04:43.640
It may be her body, her sensuality.

04:43.750 --> 04:44.876
Yes? And she?

04:44.984 --> 04:47.851
The minute we're alone
she wants to fool around.

04:47.954 --> 04:51.048
-And then?
-It usually ends up rolling on the rug.

04:51.157 --> 04:54.183
-And the maid with the big tits?
-Oh, she's part of the dowry.

04:54.294 --> 04:57.821
So you're getting married,
and I'm losing my best friend.

04:59.832 --> 05:01.197
That's okay.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.788
Two minutes and you're on, signore.

05:23.289 --> 05:24.654
You're sure he's arriving?

05:24.757 --> 05:27.658
The Colonel? Of course. He'll be here.

05:27.760 --> 05:30.194
He promised. He's very interested.

05:31.331 --> 05:34.300
It's best if you're quiet.
It's funny though, you know?

05:34.400 --> 05:36.265
Everyone would like
to be different from the others,

05:36.369 --> 05:39.770
but instead you want to be
the same as everyone else.

05:40.006 --> 05:42.600
Ten years ago,
my father was in Munich.

05:44.177 --> 05:47.044
Often, after the theater, he told me that

05:48.081 --> 05:50.606
he'd go with friends to a Bierstube.

05:51.918 --> 05:54.682
There was a nutty man
they thought a fool.

05:55.154 --> 05:57.088
He spoke about politics.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.417
He was quite an attraction.

06:02.428 --> 06:05.022
They'd buy him beer
and encourage him.

06:05.932 --> 06:09.197
He'd stand up on the table
making furious speeches.

06:11.938 --> 06:13.337
It was Hitler.

06:14.607 --> 06:17.508
Ladies and gentlemen,
that was "Who's Happier Than I"

06:17.610 --> 06:19.737
by Cesare Andrea Bixio.

06:20.813 --> 06:22.838
We conclude our program
of popular music

06:22.949 --> 06:25.008
with Arcangeli and Orchestra.

06:25.118 --> 06:28.849
The singers were Silvana Fioresi,
Oscar Carboni,

06:28.955 --> 06:32.015
Lina Termini and "The Swallows. "

06:44.070 --> 06:46.061
We bring you now
"Mystique of an Alliance, "

06:46.172 --> 06:48.163
a talk by Italo Montanari.

06:49.575 --> 06:53.534
Italy and Germany,
two strongholds of light

06:54.013 --> 06:55.674
in the course of centuries.

06:55.782 --> 06:59.411
Their unparalleled encounters
mark a turning point

07:01.621 --> 07:03.054
in the course of world history.

07:03.156 --> 07:06.421
Once again,
these two peoples are rediscovering

07:06.526 --> 07:08.221
their ancient virtues.

07:08.327 --> 07:12.195
Virtues that embody
similarity and reciprocity

07:12.298 --> 07:13.765
that have been long forgotten,

07:13.866 --> 07:16.892
that which Goebbels calls
"the Prussian aspect"

07:17.003 --> 07:18.197
of Benito Mussolini,

07:18.304 --> 07:21.705
and which we call
"the Latin aspect" of Adolf Hitler.

07:21.808 --> 07:25.904
Italy and Germany, bringing the world
two great revolutions,

07:26.012 --> 07:29.140
the Anti-Parliamentarian
and the Anti-Democratic.

07:31.951 --> 07:35.182
Please, stay seated, Clerici.

07:36.823 --> 07:38.723
Is there any news for me?

07:38.825 --> 07:42.352
Your personal record is really excellent.

07:43.196 --> 07:44.527
Then I'm hired?

07:44.630 --> 07:47.064
Such decisions must be taken slowly.

07:47.166 --> 07:50.226
-Yes, I understand.
-Yes, of course you would.

07:50.336 --> 07:54.067
Civil servant, Baccalaureate in Classics,
good future career,

07:54.173 --> 07:56.937
and Comrade Montanari
has recommended you.

07:57.643 --> 08:00.237
One morning you come to the ministry.

08:00.346 --> 08:04.112
You arrive at my office at the ministry
with your bright and shining face,

08:04.217 --> 08:05.912
you make a specific proposal.

08:10.256 --> 08:12.349
The office of the Minister!

08:14.961 --> 08:19.864
Did you ever ask yourself
why people want to collaborate with us?

08:20.600 --> 08:22.500
Some do it out of fear,

08:23.503 --> 08:25.698
most of them for the money.

08:26.706 --> 08:29.106
For faith in Fascism, very few.

08:29.208 --> 08:30.698
But you, no.

08:30.810 --> 08:34.371
I feel that you're not governed
by any of these reasons.

08:35.047 --> 08:36.809
And when may I expect a reply?

08:38.116 --> 08:39.174
I hope very soon.

08:39.284 --> 08:43.278
If I put aside the idealist revolutionary...

08:44.056 --> 08:46.547
I must ask myself what your aim is.

08:49.795 --> 08:52.764
I stand prepared to go,
as soon as you decide.

08:54.267 --> 08:55.325
Fine.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.531
I'll introduce you to the Minister.

09:50.256 --> 09:52.190
Clerici! Clerici!

09:54.660 --> 09:58.255
-At your service.
-The Minister is expecting us.

09:58.364 --> 10:00.832
Is this the first time
you're seeing the Minister?

10:00.933 --> 10:02.127
Yes.

10:02.234 --> 10:05.692
When I explained your plan to him,
the first thing he said was, "Superb.

10:05.805 --> 10:09.036
"Get to Professor Quadri
and you inspire his faith in you.

10:09.141 --> 10:11.974
"You try to discover
who his contacts in Italy are."

10:12.078 --> 10:13.545
Yes, yes, superb!

10:13.646 --> 10:15.477
And even more important, spontaneous!

10:15.581 --> 10:18.641
-And also, voluntary.
-Voluntary agency.

10:18.751 --> 10:20.844
For repressing Anti-Fascism.

10:21.988 --> 10:24.149
You've got to try
and understand women.

10:25.958 --> 10:29.086
Say she had decided to stay in Paris.
She could have, no?

10:32.398 --> 10:34.832
"Animula vagula blandula

10:34.934 --> 10:37.198
"hospes comesque corporis. "

10:39.605 --> 10:41.766
I'm sorry, I didn't get that.

10:41.874 --> 10:43.899
It's nothing. It's Latin.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.945
Five seconds, four seconds,

10:47.046 --> 10:50.573
three seconds, two seconds,
one second.

10:51.917 --> 10:55.409
The correct time
at the signal was 1:00 p.m.

11:09.001 --> 11:10.093
Here.

11:10.870 --> 11:12.068
Pretty.

11:15.274 --> 11:17.674
Aren't you giving them to me?

11:17.777 --> 11:20.610
Today I absolutely need your flowers.

11:20.713 --> 11:23.739
Give them here. For you.

11:27.953 --> 11:30.820
You know what I was thinking?
I really must go to a fortune teller.

11:30.923 --> 11:33.414
I want to know everything about you.

11:38.130 --> 11:40.189
Don't stand around looking.

11:48.140 --> 11:49.664
Darling!

12:07.960 --> 12:09.154
Careful!

12:10.196 --> 12:13.165
But, Marcello, we're engaged,
what's wrong with it?

12:13.265 --> 12:15.927
My uncle brought something
from America.

12:17.970 --> 12:19.335
What is it?

12:46.632 --> 12:48.224
Mama made out a list of invitations.

12:48.334 --> 12:50.700
-Want to see it?
-No, I trust her.

12:51.403 --> 12:53.496
I was talking to Don Lattanzi.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.631
If you want to marry,
you go to communion,

12:55.741 --> 12:57.504
you've got to confess.

12:57.610 --> 13:00.238
Otherwise he says he cannot marry us.

13:01.280 --> 13:02.838
I don't believe in it.

13:03.449 --> 13:04.473
Who does?

13:04.583 --> 13:08.451
Ninety percent of the people
who go to church today don't believe.

13:08.554 --> 13:10.545
The priests don't either.

13:10.656 --> 13:13.716
All right, if you want me to,
I'll even confess.

13:14.894 --> 13:16.919
I love you.

13:17.763 --> 13:21.062
If you want to...

13:24.203 --> 13:26.899
-If I want to...
-Yes, right here.

13:27.940 --> 13:31.706
On the floor, on the carpet. Want to?

13:34.613 --> 13:36.808
Better think about the priest.

13:38.617 --> 13:40.710
He may not grant absolution.

13:41.020 --> 13:43.284
They grant everyone absolution.

13:45.024 --> 13:48.585
After all, it will be so soon,
our honeymoon.

13:50.596 --> 13:54.191
Have you decided yet, where?

13:54.900 --> 13:55.924
Yes.

13:58.838 --> 14:01.272
But I can't tell you anything yet.

14:04.743 --> 14:06.267
It's a surprise.

14:06.378 --> 14:08.972
-A surprise?
-A surprise?

14:09.248 --> 14:12.547
Yes, yes, I adore surprises.

14:15.421 --> 14:17.286
Giulia, leave us alone.

14:21.026 --> 14:24.257
-Marcello, I went down for the mail...
-Come and eat!

14:32.638 --> 14:34.538
The letter's anonymous?

14:35.574 --> 14:37.064
What is it all about?

14:37.176 --> 14:39.974
But you know
they're just awful to do this.

14:40.079 --> 14:41.842
Worse than stabbing us in the back.

14:41.947 --> 14:43.278
But what's in the letter?

14:43.382 --> 14:46.078
And the stamp shows
it's someone in Rome.

14:46.185 --> 14:49.643
Let me see, Mama.
I want to see what's written there.

14:49.755 --> 14:52.553
Read it just for us. But then I'll burn it.

14:53.259 --> 14:55.659
There are such ugly things in it.

14:56.729 --> 14:59.857
"Signora, in permitting your daughter
and her fiancé to marry,

14:59.965 --> 15:01.694
"you're committing more than an error,

15:01.800 --> 15:04.132
"you're committing a crime."

15:08.140 --> 15:09.971
"Signor Clerici's father

15:10.075 --> 15:14.239
"has been confined in a mental home,
with a brain disease

15:14.346 --> 15:15.608
"brought on by syphilis.

15:15.714 --> 15:17.375
"As you know, this disease is hereditary.

15:17.483 --> 15:21.351
"There's still time to stop this marriage.
A friend."

15:22.421 --> 15:24.048
I'd be happy to undergo a check-up.

15:24.156 --> 15:26.920
-Ridiculous.
-No. I don't mind a bit.

15:27.026 --> 15:30.189
In Germany, premarital medical tests
are obligatory, a friend told me.

15:30.296 --> 15:34.232
My boy, I know. You're not just a man,

15:34.466 --> 15:36.457
you're an angel!

15:36.769 --> 15:38.168
Thank you.

15:39.038 --> 15:41.563
You see, the origin of my father's
mental illness isn't venereal.

15:41.674 --> 15:43.073
That can be medically confirmed.

15:43.175 --> 15:45.234
By the way,
my little girl has had the mumps,

15:45.344 --> 15:47.574
scarlet fever, and German measles.

15:47.680 --> 15:50.615
-They're all very moral maladies.
-Yes!

16:37.029 --> 16:38.997
Look here, who are you?
Why are you following me?

16:39.098 --> 16:40.759
Pure coincidence.

16:42.034 --> 16:43.899
I wasn't following you.

16:44.636 --> 16:47.628
Evidently, we're both going
to the same place.

16:54.079 --> 16:57.378
I'd like to ask you something.
Would your name be Clerici?

16:57.483 --> 16:59.713
Yes, I'm Dottore Clerici.
And who are you?

16:59.818 --> 17:03.481
I'm Special Agent Manganiello.
Sent by the Colonel.

17:03.589 --> 17:04.817
Get in.

17:05.590 --> 17:07.286
-Thanks.
-Hemlock!

17:09.094 --> 17:13.121
Such disorder.
The place looks like a dung heap.

17:14.233 --> 17:15.825
Yes, it's a pity.

17:17.301 --> 17:18.496
Hemlock!

17:29.181 --> 17:31.775
Speed up, Manganiello,
or we won't catch up with them.

17:31.884 --> 17:35.342
I can't go faster than this, sir.
The road is slippery.

17:37.589 --> 17:38.886
Not more than half an hour ahead.

17:38.991 --> 17:40.982
Don't talk so much. Hurry!

17:45.631 --> 17:46.825
It's slippery.

17:46.932 --> 17:50.095
I know. But we must save her,
no matter how slippery.

17:50.202 --> 17:51.362
I understand you.

17:51.470 --> 17:56.703
But if we break our necks,
where will that get us? Dottore?

17:57.309 --> 18:00.608
The Colonel told me
that I have to tell you...

18:00.712 --> 18:02.646
After. Wait here.

18:05.284 --> 18:07.548
Mother. Please cover yourself.

18:07.753 --> 18:09.846
I don't want to see you half nude.

18:09.955 --> 18:14.016
What a son I have.
A moralist, my son is now.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.158
You know? I had a dream just now.

18:18.263 --> 18:21.289
You came in here by that door,
you sat where you are.

18:21.400 --> 18:23.265
You kissed me actually.

18:29.141 --> 18:30.904
Why aren't you dressed?

18:31.009 --> 18:32.203
What's the time?

18:32.311 --> 18:34.745
It's late. We're gonna visit Papa.

18:41.353 --> 18:43.048
Why doesn't he die?

18:44.957 --> 18:48.859
All that hospital money we'd save,
and I've got so little.

18:48.961 --> 18:52.397
-We'll sell the auto.
-No. I'm not going to sell that.

18:53.098 --> 18:55.896
If I do, it means discharging Hemlock

18:56.268 --> 18:58.532
and I must have him near me.

18:58.637 --> 19:00.969
I get so lonely in this house.

19:01.073 --> 19:03.371
I want to see him when I please.

19:05.043 --> 19:07.307
Please don't talk to me
about your lovers.

19:07.412 --> 19:10.279
What do you mean? There's only one.

19:11.016 --> 19:14.076
And he's much more elegant
than your silly fiancé is.

19:19.191 --> 19:21.159
What a bastard you are!

19:21.426 --> 19:26.193
No, I'm not selling the car.

19:26.932 --> 19:28.331
I will sell the house.

19:28.433 --> 19:30.401
I want to travel around Europe.

19:30.502 --> 19:32.663
After all, I was born to travel.

19:32.771 --> 19:34.636
And Rome has become so provincial.

19:34.740 --> 19:37.231
Middle-class children marrying
into all kinds of good families.

19:37.342 --> 19:39.640
It's all a lot of horse manure!

19:46.351 --> 19:49.548
-Special Agent Manganiello!
-Present!

19:51.089 --> 19:54.650
Does this house look normal to you?
A place for normal people?

19:54.760 --> 19:56.785
The Colonel told me
that I have to tell you...

19:56.895 --> 19:58.795
For a normal childhood?

19:58.897 --> 20:01.365
The decadence here
makes me nauseous.

20:01.466 --> 20:02.899
-Manganiello.
-Yes, Dottore?

20:03.001 --> 20:04.468
Comrade.

20:05.504 --> 20:07.096
Do you see this?

20:08.307 --> 20:09.797
It's morphine.

20:11.743 --> 20:13.802
What did the Colonel say?

20:13.912 --> 20:16.176
There's a small change in the program.

20:16.281 --> 20:19.182
On your way to Paris
before you cross the frontier,

20:19.284 --> 20:23.277
you must stop at Ventimiglia,
Via dei Glicini, number three.

20:23.388 --> 20:25.583
Number three Via dei Glicini.

20:26.892 --> 20:29.656
You'll meet a trusted person
called Raoul.

20:29.928 --> 20:32.260
He'll give you further instructions.

20:32.364 --> 20:34.889
How long have you been in the ranks?

20:35.934 --> 20:38.027
I began in 1923.

20:38.136 --> 20:40.263
Turkey, France, Greece.

20:40.372 --> 20:42.567
-Always into the breach?
-I'm on the move.

20:42.674 --> 20:44.198
All for family and my country.

20:44.309 --> 20:46.539
Your country before the family.

20:46.645 --> 20:48.909
Yes, sir. Of course.

20:49.014 --> 20:50.481
Comrade!

20:57.623 --> 21:01.423
Manganiello, you see that individual?

21:02.694 --> 21:04.252
His name is Ki.

21:04.963 --> 21:06.692
-Ki?
-That's right.

21:06.898 --> 21:09.162
"Ki" means Hemlock in Japanese.

21:11.570 --> 21:13.970
Being called Hemlock isn't normal.

21:14.239 --> 21:15.797
He's a procurer.

21:17.743 --> 21:21.474
He couldn't be my brother,
but my mother could be his mother.

21:21.880 --> 21:23.939
I said it doesn't seem normal.

21:25.651 --> 21:28.882
He brings her morphine
and uses her as he likes.

21:29.221 --> 21:30.711
-Hemlock?
-Yes.

21:32.824 --> 21:35.622
You must understand why I tell you this.

21:38.630 --> 21:42.964
Five minutes and he won't have
the time to take a valise.

21:55.714 --> 21:58.012
Tell the Colonel to count on me!

22:00.118 --> 22:03.554
Hemlock! Hemlock!

22:03.655 --> 22:06.351
-Hemlock!
-Where is he hiding?

22:07.092 --> 22:08.389
You weren't rude to him again,
were you?

22:08.493 --> 22:10.427
I? No, he's so charming.

22:13.298 --> 22:14.492
Hemlock!

22:16.568 --> 22:17.899
Hemlock!

22:27.279 --> 22:29.076
Have you looked in his room?

22:29.181 --> 22:32.116
I've looked everywhere.
Even under your bed.

22:57.476 --> 22:59.774
-How are things, Franz?
-Better than yesterday.

22:59.878 --> 23:02.176
-Yesterday, we were bad.
-Pretty bad?

23:02.280 --> 23:04.111
Yesterday we were forced
to wear our straitjacket.

23:04.216 --> 23:05.547
-And today?
-Today is better.

23:05.650 --> 23:07.777
The wind seems to help our inspiration.

23:07.886 --> 23:10.218
I'll never be tired of repeating.

23:10.322 --> 23:12.017
If the State doesn't model itself

23:12.124 --> 23:15.218
on the image of the individual,
how will the individual

23:15.327 --> 23:18.455
ever model himself
in the image of the state?

23:18.563 --> 23:20.588
Et cetera, et cetera.

23:21.433 --> 23:24.266
Slaughter and melancholy.

23:25.003 --> 23:27.233
Slaughter and melancholy.

23:27.339 --> 23:30.137
Antonio, your son's
decided to get married.

23:32.411 --> 23:34.436
Marcello getting married?

23:39.151 --> 23:42.450
Slaughter and melancholy.

23:43.622 --> 23:44.680
Look.

23:46.458 --> 23:47.925
The announcement of the wedding.

23:48.026 --> 23:50.517
Stop it. He's your father!

23:53.532 --> 23:55.500
I like it. Sign it.

24:05.510 --> 24:08.001
Read. He's not as crazy as he looks.

24:11.116 --> 24:13.812
May I ask a moment alone
with my father?

24:14.486 --> 24:16.113
When I was just a boy,

24:16.254 --> 24:18.188
you used to tell me
about your punitive forays.

24:18.290 --> 24:20.258
I don't know, I can't recall anything.

24:20.358 --> 24:23.418
But why are you ashamed?
It's important for me.

24:24.095 --> 24:28.623
When you were healthy,
you used a big cudgel.

24:28.733 --> 24:29.791
Yes.

24:29.901 --> 24:32.699
-And did you give castor oil to them?
-Yes.

24:33.038 --> 24:34.733
-And didn't you torture them?
-Yes.

24:34.840 --> 24:37.308
Didn't you kill? You killed, too?

24:37.409 --> 24:40.071
Go away! Franz! Franz!

24:56.962 --> 24:59.487
Do you believe at all in fate, Dottore?

25:00.098 --> 25:04.364
Well, two years ago in Africa,
after a mission like this,

25:04.469 --> 25:08.496
they tell me at Headquarters,
"Did you receive the counter-orders?"

25:08.607 --> 25:10.700
"Hey, what counter-orders?"

25:11.209 --> 25:13.109
Well, in Rome, they decided
to suspend the whole thing

25:13.211 --> 25:15.372
because it wasn't necessary.

25:16.214 --> 25:17.806
Let's hurry!

25:19.818 --> 25:22.013
There's nothing we can do
for the woman

25:22.120 --> 25:24.054
even if we get there in time.

25:24.155 --> 25:27.352
You know perfectly well
we can't afford any witnesses.

25:27.692 --> 25:28.920
Then stop!

25:30.028 --> 25:31.222
I'll get out!

25:37.102 --> 25:39.434
What's the use of going? You go!

25:47.245 --> 25:48.837
Dottore Marcello!

25:51.182 --> 25:53.980
But we have to be there.
We have a certain responsibility.

25:54.085 --> 25:55.950
Would you look at that!

25:57.055 --> 25:58.488
Stop!

26:04.195 --> 26:06.163
Who makes the report otherwise?

26:06.464 --> 26:08.022
Unbutton his pants!

26:10.936 --> 26:13.302
Let me up! Let me up!

26:13.405 --> 26:16.067
The police! The police! Come on!

26:51.977 --> 26:53.035
Stop!

27:04.255 --> 27:06.723
-What's your name?
-Marcello Clerici. What's yours?

27:06.825 --> 27:09.419
Pasqualino Semirama. But call me Lino.

27:20.705 --> 27:23.003
How long is it since
your last confession?

27:23.108 --> 27:24.405
Since I made my first Holy Communion.

27:24.509 --> 27:26.409
Bad, my son, very bad.

27:26.978 --> 27:29.242
-How old are you?
-Thirty-four.

27:29.547 --> 27:32.846
And all this time
you have lived like an animal.

27:33.985 --> 27:37.045
Tell me, which sins
have you committed?

27:38.289 --> 27:40.519
I've committed them all.
Even the worst sin.

27:40.625 --> 27:44.391
-All?
-All. Even murder.

27:44.996 --> 27:49.626
Murder? And you didn't
feel the need to confess?

27:50.301 --> 27:51.325
Pardon?

27:51.436 --> 27:54.928
You didn't feel the need
to rush to confession?

27:57.876 --> 27:59.138
I was 13.

28:30.475 --> 28:32.375
Well, what were your friends
trying to do?

28:32.477 --> 28:33.774
They're just stupid.

28:33.878 --> 28:35.675
What did they want from you?

28:55.900 --> 28:58.061
All right, then, what present?

28:58.603 --> 28:59.627
A gun.

28:59.738 --> 29:02.104
-A cap pistol?
-No, a real one.

29:02.707 --> 29:05.676
I have one, too. A Mauser.

29:06.244 --> 29:09.407
You want it?
If you want it, I'll give it to you.

29:09.614 --> 29:12.777
-Where is it?
-It's in my room. Come.

29:14.385 --> 29:17.286
I have a pretty oriental kimono, too.

29:17.756 --> 29:21.453
-Do you know who Madame Butterfly is?
-Where are you going?

30:23.588 --> 30:26.819
Go on, tell me.
What did he want from you?

30:26.925 --> 30:29.917
I didn't know what.
He was so much like a woman.

30:30.028 --> 30:32.496
-A woman?
-He trembled like a woman.

30:33.198 --> 30:35.758
Well, what happened? Kisses?

30:36.601 --> 30:38.034
Touching you?

30:39.470 --> 30:42.234
Are you sure you're telling me the truth?

30:43.975 --> 30:45.169
Yes.

30:45.944 --> 30:50.210
And what happened there between you?
Carnal relations?

30:53.017 --> 30:56.111
Shoot. What are you waiting for?
Go on, shoot.

30:56.221 --> 30:57.916
Kill the pretty butterfly!

31:36.327 --> 31:40.024
-Now you must tell me the details.
-No, that's enough, please.

31:40.131 --> 31:42.497
It's almost as though you think sodomy

31:42.600 --> 31:44.864
is a more mortal sin
than killing somebody, padre.

31:44.969 --> 31:47.062
I won't permit such insolence.

31:47.171 --> 31:49.071
You are forgetting
that I happen to be the priest,

31:49.173 --> 31:50.868
and you the sinner.

31:51.910 --> 31:56.108
After that once, did you have
sexual relations with other men?

31:56.581 --> 31:59.345
No. All the rest were normal.

31:59.450 --> 32:01.042
Which means what?

32:01.152 --> 32:03.120
A brothel when I was 18.

32:04.255 --> 32:06.883
Since then,
relationships only with women.

32:06.991 --> 32:10.449
This in your opinion
is a sexual life that's normal?

32:10.561 --> 32:12.256
Yes. But why?

32:12.697 --> 32:15.461
But you, my son,
have always lived in sin.

32:16.734 --> 32:21.637
Normal means matrimony,
having a wife, family.

32:22.373 --> 32:23.965
That's what I find.

32:24.075 --> 32:26.942
Bravo, bravo, bravo.

32:27.045 --> 32:29.741
I'm going to build a life that's normal.

32:30.148 --> 32:32.480
I'm marrying a petty bourgeois.

32:33.117 --> 32:35.881
Then she must be a fine girl.

32:38.957 --> 32:40.857
Speak out. Go ahead!

32:45.830 --> 32:47.058
Mediocre.

32:48.333 --> 32:50.233
A mound of petty ideas.

32:51.836 --> 32:54.100
Full of petty ambitions.

32:55.073 --> 32:56.938
She's all bed and kitchen.

32:57.041 --> 32:59.407
You have no right
to use such expressions.

32:59.510 --> 33:00.807
Normality.

33:01.913 --> 33:05.440
I intend to construct my normality,
but it won't be easy.

33:05.550 --> 33:08.348
-Stay within religion...
-Outside religion!

33:08.987 --> 33:12.252
God is so bountiful.
The Virgin is so maternal.

33:12.857 --> 33:15.155
Christ is so merciful to us all.

33:15.693 --> 33:19.390
And the priest is so blessed
with understanding.

33:22.533 --> 33:25.297
You haven't demonstrated
any horror at my crime yet.

33:25.403 --> 33:27.564
It didn't make you pause.

33:27.672 --> 33:31.574
You're surprised because I didn't run
to confession right away.

33:31.776 --> 33:34.108
The one thing you have to do
is repent humbly,

33:34.212 --> 33:35.440
ask His pardon today.

33:35.546 --> 33:39.846
I've already repented.
I want to be excused by society.

33:40.551 --> 33:41.575
Yes.

33:42.787 --> 33:46.154
I want to confess today
the sin I'll commit tomorrow.

33:46.324 --> 33:48.383
One sin atones for another.

33:48.826 --> 33:52.353
It is the price I must pay society.
And I shall pay it.

33:52.730 --> 33:54.664
Are you a part of some new sect?

33:54.766 --> 33:57.428
Do you belong
to a group of subversives?

33:57.902 --> 34:00.166
No. No.

34:01.305 --> 34:05.435
I belong to a group that
tracks down all the subversives.

34:06.477 --> 34:08.877
Ego te absolvo

34:09.213 --> 34:11.010
a peccatis tuis.

34:12.016 --> 34:13.141
Music!

34:40.478 --> 34:41.672
Long live the bridegroom!

34:41.779 --> 34:43.576
Long live the bridegroom!

34:43.681 --> 34:44.978
Congratulations!

34:45.083 --> 34:47.380
-When is the wedding?
-Next Sunday.

34:47.485 --> 34:49.282
The bride, why didn't you bring her?

34:49.387 --> 34:50.614
What's her name?

34:50.721 --> 34:54.953
Let's drink to the end of bachelorhood!

34:55.927 --> 34:59.158
-We have biscuits, too.
-Crackers as well.

35:03.434 --> 35:06.062
Only a drop. Pour me just a drop.

35:06.170 --> 35:08.229
It goes to my head quickly.

35:20.218 --> 35:24.712
-The party makes me nervous.
-People wanted to meet you.

35:28.826 --> 35:32.728
-Never mind. It's just a tray.
-Good, good. It's a lucky sign.

35:37.034 --> 35:39.434
You know, they're so excited.

35:40.538 --> 35:45.305
Whenever there's an event,
people get excited.

35:45.576 --> 35:47.510
Forgive them.

35:47.612 --> 35:51.104
-I'm going on a mission.
-Good!

35:55.019 --> 35:58.113
Your performance was wonderful.

35:58.222 --> 36:01.316
-I appreciate it.
-I am never refused.

36:04.095 --> 36:08.327
Music. Come on, let's play.

36:15.873 --> 36:19.934
People are waiting
to speak with the Duce.

36:20.144 --> 36:23.602
Suddenly a frightful scream is heard.

36:34.025 --> 36:35.515
That's enough.

36:37.128 --> 36:42.031
Where are you? Started again?

36:43.100 --> 36:47.036
Last time's lesson wasn't enough
for you? Stop crying.

36:47.305 --> 36:50.934
I shall play for you
the last part of "Foxtrot" by Maestro Lori.

36:58.516 --> 37:01.952
What do you get
out of working for the man?

37:04.222 --> 37:07.214
I get the feeling I'm finally back

37:07.325 --> 37:10.021
to the normal state I mentioned to you.

37:11.796 --> 37:16.563
-How do you think a normal man...
-A normal man!

37:19.670 --> 37:21.900
For me, a normal man is one

37:23.341 --> 37:27.607
who turns his head to see
a beautiful woman's bottom.

37:28.746 --> 37:31.476
The point is not just to turn your head.

37:31.582 --> 37:33.550
There are 5-6 reasons,

37:34.552 --> 37:39.990
and he is glad to find people
who are like him, his equals.

37:40.458 --> 37:43.359
That's why he likes crowded beaches,

37:43.461 --> 37:45.486
football, the bar downtown...

37:45.596 --> 37:47.723
At Piazza Venezia.

37:49.267 --> 37:51.929
He likes people similar to himself

37:52.036 --> 37:55.199
and does not trust
those who are different.

37:56.474 --> 37:59.807
That's why a normal man is
a true brother, a true citizen,

37:59.910 --> 38:02.378
-a true patriot.
-A true Fascist.

38:08.152 --> 38:11.417
You haven't ever wondered
how come we're friends?

38:12.556 --> 38:16.117
Since we're different from the others.

38:17.495 --> 38:19.429
We are two of a kind.

38:20.965 --> 38:24.901
Are you here?

38:28.439 --> 38:32.899
What's the matter, you don't agree?
I know you do.

38:33.277 --> 38:35.211
I am never wrong.

38:37.048 --> 38:40.540
It rains from the scattered clouds

38:40.651 --> 38:43.586
It rains on the parched
tamarisks about you

38:43.921 --> 38:46.253
The happy pines glistening dew

38:47.458 --> 38:49.983
And upon the myrtles it rains anew

38:50.561 --> 38:52.654
It rains upon our naked hands

38:52.763 --> 38:54.697
On our transparent vestments

38:54.799 --> 38:57.791
On the new thoughts our souls reveal

39:00.104 --> 39:03.198
And on the fable
that eluded me yesterday

39:04.241 --> 39:06.505
And eludes me today, Hermione

39:24.895 --> 39:27.728
Marcello, I am unworthy of you.

39:28.966 --> 39:31.594
Marcello, I am unworthy of you.

39:32.937 --> 39:35.599
Yes, yes. I don't deserve you.

39:36.173 --> 39:38.573
You sound the same as your mother.

39:43.948 --> 39:46.644
I have something to tell you,
but you mustn't look at me,

39:46.751 --> 39:49.879
so please look out there.
If you look, I'll be ashamed.

39:53.457 --> 39:55.652
Maybe afterwards
you won't love me anymore,

39:55.760 --> 39:58.126
but I've got to tell you.

39:58.696 --> 40:02.723
You know,
what you think of me isn't true.

40:03.701 --> 40:07.228
You think I'm a virgin. I'm not.

40:09.974 --> 40:12.499
What do you think of me now?

40:12.777 --> 40:15.940
I didn't marry you because
I thought you're still a virgin.

40:16.046 --> 40:18.378
Dearest, I know
your mentality's modern,

40:18.482 --> 40:21.076
but then I felt I should tell you the truth.

40:21.752 --> 40:23.481
I forgot to mention it.

40:24.255 --> 40:27.349
At Ventimiglia, we'll get off.
I've got an appointment.

40:28.392 --> 40:31.520
But I have to tell you
the whole thing. I have to.

40:37.168 --> 40:38.601
You're angry.

40:39.570 --> 40:43.267
You were in love with someone
before you met me. Who was it?

40:44.008 --> 40:47.171
He was a man of 60.
A very disgusting old man.

40:49.380 --> 40:51.348
A friend of my family's.

40:52.450 --> 40:56.181
-Who is it?
-It's the Advocate Perpuzio.

40:56.287 --> 40:57.549
Perpuzio?

40:59.924 --> 41:02.825
-But he's one of our witnesses.
-He insisted on it.

41:02.927 --> 41:05.122
But how was I going to say no?

41:10.568 --> 41:13.128
-Six years it went on.
-Six years?

41:14.705 --> 41:16.002
Six years.

41:20.277 --> 41:21.301
All right.

41:21.412 --> 41:24.006
Pardon, monsieur.
We'll be in Ventimiglia in a few minutes.

41:24.114 --> 41:25.342
Thank you.

41:35.493 --> 41:38.656
-This is number three Via dei Glicini?
-Number three.

42:02.219 --> 42:03.811
Who is it?

42:03.921 --> 42:06.947
He looked to me like he might be
an officer in civvies!

42:20.671 --> 42:23.697
This isn't a museum.
Go inside, go inside!

42:25.809 --> 42:28.369
I'll send the others down right away.

42:29.580 --> 42:32.105
I'm an idiot, a complete maniac.

42:36.053 --> 42:37.987
Again! Say it again.

42:38.489 --> 42:40.889
The gentleman is a friend
of Signor Raoul's.

42:40.991 --> 42:43.357
Go on! Say it!

42:44.295 --> 42:47.321
I'm crazy, a complete maniac.

42:54.939 --> 42:56.236
I'm crazy.

43:05.182 --> 43:06.444
Clerici!

43:07.284 --> 43:09.548
What are you doing wasting time?

43:09.653 --> 43:10.950
Come here!

43:17.027 --> 43:18.051
What?

43:18.162 --> 43:21.188
Professor Quadri's activities in France

43:21.298 --> 43:23.630
have become interfering
and provocative.

43:23.734 --> 43:26.828
It's become necessary
to make an example of him.

43:28.138 --> 43:31.301
You had to contact and inspire
him with confidence

43:31.408 --> 43:32.966
and get information.

43:33.077 --> 43:35.602
-But now...
-But now?

43:36.914 --> 43:40.816
There's a counter-order from Rome.
All you do is eliminate him.

43:43.420 --> 43:45.081
-That clear?
-Very.

43:46.390 --> 43:49.086
The operation will not
take place in Paris.

43:49.193 --> 43:52.424
It's up to you to choose
the locale and the moment.

43:54.531 --> 43:56.021
It's up to you.

44:02.539 --> 44:05.030
There's nothing more to talk about.

44:05.442 --> 44:08.878
Fine. This means I have no alternative.

44:10.414 --> 44:12.006
Comrade Clerici!

44:12.583 --> 44:15.450
It must be quick and decisive! Comrade!

44:21.759 --> 44:24.557
The train for Paris leaves in an hour.

44:26.330 --> 44:29.993
I lost my hat. Where's my hat?
Where is it?

44:36.140 --> 44:38.506
Then he entered the room. Slowly.

44:39.009 --> 44:41.671
Finally he stood behind me
and said, "Is that French?"

44:41.779 --> 44:43.474
Come and sit here.

44:47.117 --> 44:49.415
"It's my Latin lesson," I said.

44:50.287 --> 44:52.255
He grabbed me by my hair.

44:55.626 --> 44:58.493
And then, imagine,
I used to call him Uncle.

45:00.698 --> 45:02.859
He unbuttoned my blouse then.

45:13.711 --> 45:16.202
I was well-developed at 15, I guess.

45:18.182 --> 45:22.209
He began to squeeze my breasts
harder until I almost fainted.

45:29.793 --> 45:34.059
And then, I don't know.
I was suddenly on the bed.

45:37.501 --> 45:39.230
He was on top of me.

45:39.403 --> 45:43.404
Then I understood everything
and all my strength left me.

45:52.850 --> 45:54.408
Did you like it?

45:55.285 --> 45:57.412
-I lay there passive.
-And then?

45:57.521 --> 45:59.921
He did everything to me he wanted.

46:09.900 --> 46:13.336
I cried so much,
and in order to console me,

46:13.437 --> 46:16.838
he said he was absolutely,
absolutely crazy about me.

46:18.242 --> 46:19.709
Six years.

46:55.078 --> 46:57.638
I would like 26, 15, 37.

46:57.748 --> 47:01.650
-Length nine and width...
-I'll wait.

47:02.186 --> 47:05.314
Who are you telephoning to?
One, two, three, four...

47:05.422 --> 47:08.289
-A man with a hump.
-Hunchbacks bring good luck!

47:08.392 --> 47:09.950
Five and six.

47:11.161 --> 47:15.120
Six by nine ought to amount
to 54 meters square, isn't it?

47:15.232 --> 47:16.722
That's right.

47:16.967 --> 47:19.663
He was our professor at the university.

47:21.638 --> 47:23.629
They named him Smerdikoff.

47:24.374 --> 47:27.241
But his was the only class
that was crowded.

47:27.945 --> 47:30.846
All the freshman girls
were in love with him.

47:32.883 --> 47:34.214
Still busy?

47:36.153 --> 47:39.316
Please, in a few minutes
will you ring it for me?

47:41.925 --> 47:45.918
The year I was supposed to graduate,
they gave him the castor oil.

47:46.530 --> 47:48.998
He won't remember after nine years.

47:49.666 --> 47:52.294
I had to go and ask him for my thesis.

47:54.438 --> 47:56.497
He asked me if I was a Fascist.

47:56.607 --> 47:58.268
And what did you answer?

47:58.942 --> 48:01.172
I didn't bother to answer him.

48:02.746 --> 48:04.771
He told me it would be
impossible for him

48:04.882 --> 48:07.715
to teach philosophy in a Fascist country.

48:08.452 --> 48:09.578
Hello.

48:11.288 --> 48:13.813
This is Clerici.
I was a student of yours back in Rome,

48:13.924 --> 48:16.119
and I'd like to see you again.

48:18.595 --> 48:21.996
Of course, Professor.
I came about my graduate thesis.

48:22.466 --> 48:25.162
It was the year that
you stopped teaching.

48:25.269 --> 48:26.998
I don't remember your name.

48:27.104 --> 48:29.766
It was so long ago. Clerici, you said?

48:29.873 --> 48:34.173
Yes. And you said to me...
I remember that day so well, everything,

48:34.912 --> 48:37.676
you said,
"The time for reflection is over for me.

48:37.781 --> 48:39.612
"Now begins the time for action."

48:39.716 --> 48:42.947
-And you want to see me?
-Yes.

48:43.186 --> 48:44.210
Why?

48:45.188 --> 48:47.486
I don't have any precise reason.

48:48.058 --> 48:50.151
They still speak about you in Rome.

48:50.260 --> 48:52.751
And I'd like to see you, that's all.

48:53.764 --> 48:56.790
Let's see.
Could you come over to my house?

48:56.900 --> 48:58.868
Yes. When?

48:59.169 --> 49:02.696
Today if you like, after lunch.
Come and have a coffee.

49:02.806 --> 49:05.775
I'm honeymooning in Paris.

49:06.076 --> 49:08.044
Would it be all right
if I brought my wife?

49:08.145 --> 49:10.170
Of course.
Seventeen Rue Saint Jacques.

49:10.280 --> 49:12.771
-I'll see you later then.
-Thank you.

49:14.651 --> 49:17.552
He has a nice voice.
Not like a hunchback's.

49:18.989 --> 49:22.652
What shall I wear?
Street clothes or really get dressed up?

49:24.895 --> 49:26.385
But why bother?

49:27.331 --> 49:30.323
He'll be a typical intellectual,
disagreeable and impotent.

49:30.434 --> 49:31.765
How do you know that?

49:31.868 --> 49:34.996
I don't really.
My uncle used to always say...

49:35.105 --> 49:37.437
-Uncle Perpuzio!
-Laugh, laugh.

49:38.308 --> 49:41.368
Only he's the one
who sent the anonymous letter.

49:48.485 --> 49:49.918
Cut that out!

49:50.854 --> 49:52.344
But, Marcello...

49:59.730 --> 50:01.891
Answer that. Say I'm not in.

50:02.165 --> 50:06.067
-But what if it's a foreigner?
-No, he'll be an Italian.

50:06.737 --> 50:08.329
Answer the phone!

50:12.309 --> 50:13.742
Hello?

50:14.011 --> 50:15.444
No, he's not in.

50:15.979 --> 50:18.004
Very well, I'll tell him.

50:18.115 --> 50:20.777
He said he'd call back this afternoon.

50:21.318 --> 50:23.286
Funny name, Manganiello.

51:25.749 --> 51:28.411
-Yes, what is it?
-I'm Monsieur Clerici.

51:28.518 --> 51:32.682
-You've got the wrong apartment.
-I've an appointment.

51:32.789 --> 51:33.983
You're Italian?

51:34.091 --> 51:37.151
The professor is expecting them.
I'll take care.

51:45.368 --> 51:46.801
Get away, Marcello!

51:50.474 --> 51:54.103
He'll bite you! Run!

52:00.717 --> 52:02.116
Down, Roby!

52:02.819 --> 52:04.810
Get down! Sit down!

52:14.297 --> 52:16.788
You're Monsieur Clerici, aren't you?

52:17.367 --> 52:18.595
Come in.

52:22.906 --> 52:26.398
-Nothing to be afraid of.
-Me? I'm not a bit frightened.

52:26.510 --> 52:29.741
Well then come up.
He won't bite now, I tell you.

52:30.113 --> 52:32.445
Funny, usually dogs like me.

52:36.620 --> 52:38.781
Is this the first time
you're visiting Paris?

52:38.889 --> 52:41.619
-Do you like it?
-Yes. It's so pretty.

52:41.725 --> 52:44.922
The station, the hotel, and now here.

52:47.664 --> 52:49.393
-Please.
-Thank you.

52:53.436 --> 52:56.701
If you like,
later I could show you a bit of the town.

52:57.073 --> 52:59.735
Really? And then
when you come to Italy,

52:59.843 --> 53:01.902
I can show you
around Rome, everything.

53:02.012 --> 53:04.003
The piazzas, the churches, the Forum...

53:04.114 --> 53:05.274
Yes.

53:08.051 --> 53:11.077
I should get them
or the coffee will be frozen.

53:11.188 --> 53:13.884
Come on, boys,
the coffee's getting cold.

53:14.824 --> 53:17.224
I wonder why she seems so hostile.

53:17.861 --> 53:20.830
Does she seem hostile?
But she's nice to me.

53:20.931 --> 53:23.798
She acts like
she knows me a hundred years.

53:23.900 --> 53:26.334
And I don't know why. I never met her.

53:26.436 --> 53:28.233
Don't even know who she is.

53:28.338 --> 53:30.272
She's married to Professor Quadri.

53:30.373 --> 53:32.398
Young enough to be his daughter.

53:32.509 --> 53:35.876
But it doesn't matter. I heard her saying,
"My husband's inside."

53:35.979 --> 53:38.209
-She said "my husband"?
-But certainly.

53:38.315 --> 53:40.408
No, I don't agree.
Printing in the shop is too expensive.

53:40.517 --> 53:42.610
But we'll never accomplish
anything with the mimeograph.

53:42.719 --> 53:46.052
-Thirty thousand copies is no joke...
-It always breaks down.

54:06.243 --> 54:09.644
My husband's still busy.

54:09.746 --> 54:11.373
He'll see you in a few minutes, all right?

54:11.481 --> 54:15.110
-Yes, we've got time.
-He said we might dine tonight.

54:15.218 --> 54:16.480
We'd love to.

54:16.586 --> 54:19.646
Later we might stop
at Joinville and dance.

54:19.756 --> 54:22.486
-You agree?
-Dancing makes me so happy!

54:23.093 --> 54:25.527
Is dancing still allowed in Italy?

54:26.162 --> 54:29.598
Now that I think of it, it's impossible.

54:29.699 --> 54:30.723
Why?

54:32.469 --> 54:33.902
'Cause I didn't bring a gown with me.

54:34.004 --> 54:37.462
We can fix that. This afternoon,
we can shop if you'll come.

54:37.574 --> 54:42.375
-Shouldn't we go immediately?
-No. I have a class at school at 3:30.

54:42.479 --> 54:45.414
But we can meet at your hotel
if you like at 5:00.

54:45.515 --> 54:47.847
-At what hotel are you?
-At the D'Orsay.

54:47.951 --> 54:50.784
-Then we'll see you at 5:00?
-No.

54:51.321 --> 54:54.757
Shopping is only for women.
Husbands pay.

54:54.858 --> 54:57.418
You mean I can go and you won't mind?

54:57.527 --> 54:58.516
No.

54:59.396 --> 55:01.421
Take him to the professor.

55:19.215 --> 55:22.048
Come in, come in, Clerici.
Did they give you coffee?

55:22.152 --> 55:25.280
-Yes, thank you.
-Goodbye. Thank you.

55:25.388 --> 55:26.446
-Giulia.
-Yes.

55:26.556 --> 55:27.818
I'm curious.

55:27.924 --> 55:31.155
Before you married him,
did you go to bed with him?

55:31.261 --> 55:33.320
It's very curious, Clerici.

55:34.497 --> 55:37.466
You come all this way only to see me?

55:39.169 --> 55:40.693
Remember, Professor,

55:41.438 --> 55:43.736
as soon as you used
to enter the classroom

55:43.840 --> 55:45.808
they had to shut the windows.

55:45.909 --> 55:48.878
You couldn't stand all that light,
that noise.

55:50.013 --> 55:52.345
Later, I understood why you used
to do that.

55:52.449 --> 55:54.280
All these years,

55:54.384 --> 55:58.115
you know what remained
most firmly imprinted on my memory?

55:58.221 --> 55:59.552
Your voice.

56:01.691 --> 56:04.751
Imagine a great dungeon
in the shape of a cave.

56:05.595 --> 56:09.497
Inside, men who have
lived there since childhood,

56:10.400 --> 56:14.336
all chained, and forced
to face the back of the cave.

56:15.372 --> 56:19.206
Behind them, far away,
the light from a fire flickers.

56:20.276 --> 56:23.404
Between the fire and the prisoners,
imagine a low wall

56:23.513 --> 56:25.071
similar to that little stage

56:25.181 --> 56:27.809
on which a puppeteer
shows his puppets.

56:32.055 --> 56:33.955
That was November '28.

56:36.292 --> 56:38.055
Yes, I remember.

56:41.297 --> 56:43.697
Now try and imagine some other men

56:44.634 --> 56:46.932
passing behind that little wall

56:47.771 --> 56:51.332
bearing statues
made of wood and stone.

56:52.208 --> 56:54.335
The statues are higher than that wall.

56:54.444 --> 56:58.676
You couldn't have brought me
a better gift than these memories.

56:58.782 --> 57:01.342
The enchained prisoners of Plato.

57:01.451 --> 57:03.578
And how they resemble us.

57:03.686 --> 57:06.519
-And what do they see?
-What do they see?

57:07.357 --> 57:11.157
You who come from Italy
should know from experience.

57:11.261 --> 57:13.593
They see only the shadows
the fire makes

57:13.696 --> 57:16.392
on the back of the cavern
that faces them.

57:16.499 --> 57:18.467
Shadows. The reflections of things.

57:18.568 --> 57:21.765
Like what's happening
to you people now in Italy.

57:22.338 --> 57:24.966
Say those prisoners were at liberty
and could speak out.

57:25.074 --> 57:28.237
Mightn't they call the shadows
they see reality, not visions?

57:28.344 --> 57:33.509
Yes. They would mistake for reality,
the shadows of reality.

57:35.351 --> 57:37.649
The myth of the great cave.

57:38.087 --> 57:40.783
That was the graduate thesis
you proposed to do for me.

57:40.890 --> 57:44.519
-Did you finish it afterwards?
-You departed. I used a different theme.

57:44.627 --> 57:48.290
I'm truly sorry, Clerici.
I had so much faith in you.

57:50.033 --> 57:52.501
-In all of you.
-No, I don't believe it.

57:52.602 --> 57:55.571
If that were true,
you'd never have left Rome.

57:55.972 --> 57:58.372
That's fine. Go on!

58:00.009 --> 58:01.943
Move faster. Move faster.

58:02.545 --> 58:04.604
Move faster. Move faster.

58:04.948 --> 58:06.882
Move faster. Move faster.

58:06.983 --> 58:10.510
At the point we had reached
there was no other choice.

58:10.620 --> 58:12.611
All we could do was emigrate.
We wanted everyone

58:12.722 --> 58:15.919
to be able to feel our disdain,
and our rebellion as exiles,

58:16.025 --> 58:19.222
the meaning of our struggle,
the historical meaning.

58:19.329 --> 58:22.696
Beautiful words, but you left
and I became a Fascist.

58:23.032 --> 58:24.795
Excuse me, Clerici,

58:25.301 --> 58:28.327
but a confirmed Fascist
doesn't talk like that.

58:34.177 --> 58:38.113
Yes? Yes, it's me. Yes. Go ahead.

58:42.952 --> 58:45.250
One lover? Only one?

58:46.189 --> 58:48.054
She went down and out.

58:48.157 --> 58:50.523
She gave her all for a redheaded pimp
with a bloodshot eye.

58:50.627 --> 58:54.154
A Jew he was, with a garlic smell.
Who'd come from Formosa once,

58:54.236 --> 58:56.830
and hauled her out of
some whorehouse in Shanghai.

58:56.938 --> 58:58.997
You really will lend me these foxes?

58:59.107 --> 59:00.836
Of course.
Keep them as long as you like.

59:00.942 --> 59:02.273
Thank you.

59:09.417 --> 59:11.749
Wait for me. I'll be right back.

59:25.634 --> 59:27.727
Do you often go around
people's houses spying?

59:27.836 --> 59:30.327
How often do I honeymoon in France?

59:30.772 --> 59:33.002
I met a woman with your eyes.

59:33.408 --> 59:35.171
-Where?
-Ventimiglia.

59:37.579 --> 59:39.945
The resemblance is unbelievable.

59:41.249 --> 59:43.979
-And who was she?
-A prostitute.

59:49.424 --> 59:50.789
Many thanks.

59:51.593 --> 59:54.756
-Did she kiss well?
-It would be like kissing you.

59:57.232 --> 59:59.632
-How did it end up then?
-It didn't.

59:59.734 --> 01:00:02.032
I embraced her and that was it.

01:00:03.071 --> 01:00:06.438
I was left with this great desire
to find her again.

01:00:06.541 --> 01:00:10.671
-Why are you so hostile?
-Because I'm sincere.

01:00:14.282 --> 01:00:16.250
Over here she had a scar.

01:00:19.921 --> 01:00:24.324
No! No! Let me go!

01:01:25.086 --> 01:01:26.849
Who knows what it's for?

01:01:26.955 --> 01:01:28.855
But it isn't gold the way I imagined.

01:01:28.957 --> 01:01:32.051
From here it's almost as small
as the one I have on my night table.

01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:33.718
They say at least once a month,

01:01:33.828 --> 01:01:37.229
some disappointed lover
throws himself off. How stupid.

01:01:37.932 --> 01:01:40.696
-You want to go to the Tower?
-Yes.

01:01:46.941 --> 01:01:47.999
Taxi!

01:01:48.109 --> 01:01:51.806
Yes. I'm glad we're going up
the Eiffel Tower.

01:02:01.022 --> 01:02:03.820
Quick! To the Eiffel Tower. Ciao!

01:02:04.759 --> 01:02:07.353
And you?

01:02:20.442 --> 01:02:21.773
Attention!

01:02:22.510 --> 01:02:25.343
Now, supple. Go on. Hup!

01:02:27.115 --> 01:02:28.878
Helene dear, chin up.

01:02:31.886 --> 01:02:32.944
Hup!

01:02:35.023 --> 01:02:36.650
Try it again now.

01:02:40.495 --> 01:02:42.929
Watch your knees, Denise.

01:02:44.399 --> 01:02:45.889
Take a breath.

01:02:50.205 --> 01:02:52.901
That's starting to look good, isn't it?

01:02:57.512 --> 01:02:58.809
Your head.

01:03:04.252 --> 01:03:05.810
Your points out.

01:03:07.122 --> 01:03:08.817
Eyes still, Margot.

01:03:21.369 --> 01:03:22.802
Take a break.

01:03:25.907 --> 01:03:27.568
Thank you, madame.

01:03:35.583 --> 01:03:37.983
-Is there some place to talk?
-Here.

01:03:38.086 --> 01:03:39.986
-No, not here.
-Why not?

01:03:52.167 --> 01:03:54.397
I have some friends in Brazil.

01:03:54.669 --> 01:03:57.467
I'll leave everything if you come with me.

01:03:58.940 --> 01:04:01.909
I, on the other hand,
have friends in Italy.

01:04:02.010 --> 01:04:04.205
I received a letter. Read it.

01:04:08.116 --> 01:04:12.519
"If you ever get this letter,
it will be in spite of the prison censors."

01:04:13.221 --> 01:04:16.588
You must never make the gesture
as wide as this.

01:04:18.393 --> 01:04:20.361
Why did you stop? Go on.

01:04:23.264 --> 01:04:25.755
"They come suddenly in the night
and kick the door of my cell

01:04:25.867 --> 01:04:27.960
"so as not to let me sleep."

01:04:29.437 --> 01:04:31.371
-Why do...
-Continue.

01:04:31.472 --> 01:04:33.872
Why do you make me read this letter?

01:04:33.975 --> 01:04:35.840
I'll tell you in a bit.

01:04:37.512 --> 01:04:40.413
"Some days,
there are the false executions.

01:04:41.482 --> 01:04:44.212
"They sent me the priest
three times already

01:04:44.319 --> 01:04:46.844
"and I refused extreme unction.

01:04:46.955 --> 01:04:49.321
"They gave me castor oil again,
but they should realize

01:04:49.424 --> 01:04:51.517
"that after almost 20 years,

01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:54.851
"I'm used to it. It has no effect."

01:04:55.830 --> 01:04:57.730
Why must I read this letter?

01:04:57.832 --> 01:04:59.925
You want me to tell you?

01:05:00.034 --> 01:05:02.366
Because you're a Fascist! A spy!

01:05:02.971 --> 01:05:05.872
You imagine you took us in?
You're mistaken.

01:05:08.243 --> 01:05:09.676
Does your husband know?

01:05:09.777 --> 01:05:12.041
Why do you think you were received?

01:05:13.581 --> 01:05:15.014
You're only a worm.

01:05:15.116 --> 01:05:17.516
You revolt me! You're disgusting!

01:05:19.487 --> 01:05:21.819
I'm getting Giulia at the hotel.

01:05:21.923 --> 01:05:23.914
We'll be on the first train home.

01:05:24.025 --> 01:05:27.051
You'd never do it.
You're too much of a coward.

01:05:52.587 --> 01:05:54.521
Marcello! Hold me.

01:06:05.266 --> 01:06:07.234
Marcello, I'm frightened.

01:06:09.871 --> 01:06:12.169
Marcello, please don't hurt us.

01:06:16.744 --> 01:06:19.235
Swear it! Swear it, please.

01:06:20.315 --> 01:06:21.748
I don't know.

01:07:05.059 --> 01:07:06.822
Giulia, look at this.

01:07:13.835 --> 01:07:15.564
Anna! Come here!

01:07:18.072 --> 01:07:19.630
It's a surprise!

01:07:22.343 --> 01:07:25.779
Look at that color. It's a dream!

01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:28.610
Come and look at this one. Here.

01:07:32.120 --> 01:07:34.918
Anna! It's divine!

01:07:37.158 --> 01:07:39.649
Look how beautiful it is! Just look!

01:07:42.296 --> 01:07:43.854
Giulia, come on.

01:07:59.914 --> 01:08:03.008
It's very big, all in wood,
with enormous beds.

01:08:03.384 --> 01:08:04.783
The house belonged to my grandfather.

01:08:04.886 --> 01:08:06.979
Luca and I used to go there often.

01:08:07.088 --> 01:08:08.578
Roby, here!

01:08:08.689 --> 01:08:12.648
But now with what's going on in Spain,
we don't leave Paris any longer.

01:08:12.760 --> 01:08:15.524
All right, Roby! That's enough!
Come here!

01:08:15.830 --> 01:08:18.594
La Savoie is beautiful.
I can't wait to get back.

01:08:36.283 --> 01:08:40.310
Dottore! Dottore!

01:08:40.988 --> 01:08:43.616
Come on, I know you're back there.

01:08:43.724 --> 01:08:46.215
Why don't you want to see me?

01:08:46.327 --> 01:08:48.522
I've been running after you all day.

01:08:48.629 --> 01:08:51.325
And it's freezing here.

01:08:54.569 --> 01:08:57.367
You ought to come out
and have a chat now.

01:08:58.906 --> 01:09:01.340
What is it you're worrying about?

01:09:01.776 --> 01:09:04.801
We'll go somewhere inside.
We'll talk about it.

01:09:06.481 --> 01:09:08.448
I have my job, you know.

01:09:09.750 --> 01:09:11.479
The time's passing.

01:09:14.020 --> 01:09:18.185
You must have a plan by now.

01:09:18.559 --> 01:09:21.255
You haven't stood still for an instant.

01:09:22.462 --> 01:09:25.591
May I say you ought to be following him,
not his wife.

01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:29.067
There's no point in screaming like that
at the birds, you know.

01:09:29.170 --> 01:09:32.071
They don't understand
you foreigners. Maniac.

01:09:32.273 --> 01:09:35.140
He thinks the birds
in Paris are foreigners.

01:09:36.243 --> 01:09:39.270
God damn it. Dottore!

01:09:39.947 --> 01:09:41.743
I do understand you.

01:09:42.250 --> 01:09:45.151
But the operation must be
quick and decisive.

01:09:56.697 --> 01:09:58.062
Third floor.

01:10:27.995 --> 01:10:30.225
You don't mind if we stay like this a bit?

01:10:30.331 --> 01:10:31.298
No.

01:10:31.399 --> 01:10:33.094
How silly you are.

01:10:33.201 --> 01:10:35.761
Remember what you yourself said
a while ago,

01:10:35.870 --> 01:10:37.929
"If I weren't married," you said.

01:10:38.039 --> 01:10:41.202
Yes, I might have said that.
I am married.

01:10:41.309 --> 01:10:43.243
It doesn't mean a thing.

01:10:44.745 --> 01:10:47.441
You have to understand
married to whom.

01:10:47.548 --> 01:10:48.879
I like him.

01:11:15.872 --> 01:11:17.396
Let's try on my new frock.

01:11:17.507 --> 01:11:21.136
No. Don't move. I want to dress you.

01:11:25.716 --> 01:11:29.618
How strange you are.
You want to be my maid now?

01:11:30.787 --> 01:11:33.813
What difference does it make?
It's my pleasure.

01:11:45.769 --> 01:11:48.499
Please, don't look at me.
I'm embarrassed.

01:11:48.605 --> 01:11:51.733
There's nothing wrong with it.
I'm a woman just as you are.

01:11:51.842 --> 01:11:55.005
Yes, but you look at me in a way...

01:11:55.112 --> 01:11:56.477
Turn around.

01:12:01.218 --> 01:12:03.152
How beautiful!

01:12:06.256 --> 01:12:08.656
How much I love Paris!

01:12:11.094 --> 01:12:12.925
When Marcello sees it!

01:12:34.084 --> 01:12:36.279
Violets? Violets, monsieur?

01:12:38.955 --> 01:12:40.684
Do you want violets?

01:12:41.358 --> 01:12:43.553
These are real Parma violets.

01:12:45.295 --> 01:12:47.456
-They're really from Parma?
-Absolutely.

01:12:47.564 --> 01:12:49.156
Let me have one.

01:12:50.667 --> 01:12:51.998
Thank you.

01:12:52.703 --> 01:12:54.671
"Ye prisoners of starvation!"

01:12:54.771 --> 01:12:57.763
Arise ye prisoners of starvation

01:12:57.874 --> 01:13:00.672
Awake ye wretched of the Earth

01:13:00.777 --> 01:13:04.178
For justice thunders condemnation

01:13:04.281 --> 01:13:07.614
A better world in birth

01:13:07.718 --> 01:13:11.381
No more tradition's chains shall bind us

01:13:11.488 --> 01:13:14.719
Arise ye slaves no more in thrall

01:13:14.825 --> 01:13:18.124
The earth shall rise on new foundations

01:13:18.228 --> 01:13:21.891
We have been naught, we shall be all

01:13:26.503 --> 01:13:29.961
'Tis the final conflict

01:13:30.073 --> 01:13:33.372
Let each stand in his place

01:13:33.477 --> 01:13:37.573
The Internationale

01:13:37.681 --> 01:13:41.242
Shall lead the human race

01:13:41.351 --> 01:13:45.219
'Tis the final conflict

01:13:45.322 --> 01:13:48.553
Let each stand in his place

01:13:48.658 --> 01:13:52.856
The Internationale

01:13:52.963 --> 01:13:55.830
Shall lead the human race

01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:57.660
Inside.

01:13:59.736 --> 01:14:01.727
-Come.
-What's the matter?

01:14:08.945 --> 01:14:12.312
-Do you like real Parma violets?
-They're not for me.

01:14:15.619 --> 01:14:17.553
I want you to have them.

01:14:18.054 --> 01:14:20.921
You couldn't have known
I'd be at the hotel.

01:14:21.458 --> 01:14:23.153
They're for Giulia.

01:14:24.461 --> 01:14:26.622
It's for you I bought them.

01:14:49.653 --> 01:14:51.518
Giulia will be beautiful tonight.

01:14:51.621 --> 01:14:53.816
Half past eight at the hotel.

01:14:59.462 --> 01:15:01.089
You know, I'm sad.

01:15:01.798 --> 01:15:05.256
Since we've arrived in Paris,
we haven't made love yet.

01:15:11.241 --> 01:15:15.302
Your knees are sharp.

01:15:29.860 --> 01:15:31.623
Here's news for you.

01:15:31.962 --> 01:15:34.487
The Quadris have a house
in the Savoie.

01:15:34.831 --> 01:15:37.163
Anna says the Professor leaves
tomorrow morning by car

01:15:37.267 --> 01:15:38.757
while she stays here.

01:15:38.869 --> 01:15:41.702
Only for a day or so, then she's
planning to join her husband

01:15:41.805 --> 01:15:44.797
and wants us to visit with them
in the mountains.

01:15:44.908 --> 01:15:46.603
I have the address.

01:15:49.212 --> 01:15:51.180
Nice, don't you think so?

01:15:57.988 --> 01:16:00.582
She told me they have
enormous beds in their villa

01:16:00.690 --> 01:16:03.124
which make awful noises!

01:16:06.229 --> 01:16:08.857
And she says there are big,
big forests in the neighborhood

01:16:08.965 --> 01:16:10.956
where no one ever passes.

01:16:17.140 --> 01:16:18.903
Anna says...

01:16:19.342 --> 01:16:22.402
Anna told me you can even
make love in the snow.

01:16:25.548 --> 01:16:29.644
Can you imagine the Professor
wandering around in the woods naked?

01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:33.485
You had me convinced
you were the typical new Italian.

01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:35.922
No such type exists yet,
but we're creating him.

01:16:36.026 --> 01:16:38.824
-Through repression?
-No, through example.

01:16:39.195 --> 01:16:42.687
Giving him castor oil?
Throwing him into prison?

01:16:43.266 --> 01:16:45.029
By torturing them? Blackmailing?

01:16:45.135 --> 01:16:48.229
Anna. Please, dear, calm down.

01:16:49.906 --> 01:16:52.739
Clerici is a Fascist. I'm an Anti-Fascist.

01:16:53.810 --> 01:16:55.243
We both knew.

01:16:55.812 --> 01:16:57.746
And we decided to have supper
together all the same.

01:16:57.847 --> 01:17:00.873
-And get the wives drunk.
-The old Professor and his ex-pupil.

01:17:00.984 --> 01:17:05.550
-Giulia, what's the matter?
-And yet I'm willing to bet.

01:17:05.655 --> 01:17:07.054
God, I've drunk so much!

01:17:07.157 --> 01:17:10.684
-You may change your mind yet.
-Impossible, Professor.

01:17:11.528 --> 01:17:14.554
My husband is naive about these things.

01:17:15.432 --> 01:17:18.890
I can't forget that Clerici was
one of my best students ever.

01:17:19.002 --> 01:17:23.063
Really? Tell me.
What was Marcello like as a student?

01:17:23.173 --> 01:17:26.438
-Serious. Too serious.
-But you can't be too serious.

01:17:26.543 --> 01:17:28.477
Really serious people are never serious.

01:17:28.578 --> 01:17:31.775
Giulia, did you ever see
your husband laugh?

01:17:31.881 --> 01:17:34.611
No, but then, he's a very serious man.
That's his nature.

01:17:34.718 --> 01:17:37.084
-Nothing the matter with that.
-That's not my nature at all.

01:17:37.187 --> 01:17:39.781
I've an idea, Clerici.
You should both remain here.

01:17:39.889 --> 01:17:42.983
You will understand a great deal
about many things living here.

01:17:43.093 --> 01:17:45.721
For you, it's an important opportunity.

01:17:46.463 --> 01:17:48.556
What do you know, Professor?

01:17:48.765 --> 01:17:49.925
He's right.

01:17:50.033 --> 01:17:52.797
He's only in Paris
to enjoy his honeymoon.

01:17:52.902 --> 01:17:54.870
By the way,
did Giulia mention my idea to you?

01:17:54.971 --> 01:17:57.633
-We have a lovely guest room...
-With an enormous bed!

01:17:57.741 --> 01:18:00.209
And from la Savoie
you can go back to Italy.

01:18:00.310 --> 01:18:02.744
Thank you,
but I promised Giulia to show her Paris.

01:18:02.846 --> 01:18:04.541
I'm half-drunk already!

01:18:04.647 --> 01:18:07.115
That's splendid.
My husband will leave tomorrow.

01:18:07.217 --> 01:18:10.584
And after you see some more of Paris,
we'll join him.

01:18:14.357 --> 01:18:16.917
Marcello, tell the truth.
Would you like us to go?

01:18:17.027 --> 01:18:20.019
But of course I would.
They're really so kind.

01:18:20.597 --> 01:18:23.760
-Well, all right.
-Perhaps Giulia doesn't want to go.

01:18:23.867 --> 01:18:24.925
No, no!

01:18:25.035 --> 01:18:27.503
If you don't like me, you can just say so.

01:18:28.471 --> 01:18:30.598
Don't embarrass dear Giulia.

01:18:31.975 --> 01:18:35.172
-We'll definitely come. Right, Giulia?
-Yes.

01:18:36.646 --> 01:18:38.238
Let me sit there.

01:18:44.054 --> 01:18:46.750
God, it's going around, the whole place.

01:18:47.857 --> 01:18:51.054
It's like that restaurant
we had on the train

01:18:54.230 --> 01:18:56.357
with that funny fat man.

01:19:05.742 --> 01:19:09.234
Marcello, will you give me
a proof of your friendship?

01:19:10.580 --> 01:19:13.743
There's something to be sent. A letter.

01:19:14.751 --> 01:19:18.653
To Rome. To a comrade.
I ask you to help me.

01:19:19.622 --> 01:19:22.352
It has to be delivered personally.
There's no hurry.

01:19:22.459 --> 01:19:24.689
When you get back to Italy
from our place.

01:19:24.794 --> 01:19:26.659
This might mean prison.

01:19:26.763 --> 01:19:28.924
Any one of my men
would risk much more.

01:19:29.032 --> 01:19:31.125
Professor, one would say
you're doing this purposely,

01:19:31.234 --> 01:19:33.634
just to get me into trouble there.

01:19:34.537 --> 01:19:36.732
Considering what you're
going back to, Clerici,

01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:40.207
-a month in a Fascist jail may be better.
-Excuse me.

01:19:54.424 --> 01:19:55.755
What is it?

01:19:57.494 --> 01:19:59.121
What's the matter?

01:20:00.930 --> 01:20:02.864
Hey, Dottore! Watch out!

01:20:04.601 --> 01:20:08.037
What? I'm here to protect you
and you want to kill me?

01:20:09.005 --> 01:20:13.237
I don't want to kill anyone. Here.
I don't want to carry it anymore.

01:20:15.378 --> 01:20:17.243
What is this all about?

01:20:18.448 --> 01:20:21.940
-You giving up?
-No, it's so clumsy.

01:20:23.353 --> 01:20:27.084
I don't even know how to use it.
It's in my way, it's so heavy.

01:20:33.730 --> 01:20:37.325
Listen to me, comrade!

01:20:38.134 --> 01:20:40.602
I want you to look straight at me.

01:20:40.970 --> 01:20:44.531
We're in a war, right?
You give up, you're a deserter.

01:20:47.443 --> 01:20:50.276
Everybody's thought
of deserting at least once.

01:20:50.380 --> 01:20:54.180
-I wouldn't think of that.
-Even I did. Really. Yes, yes, yes.

01:20:54.817 --> 01:20:59.117
But I said to myself, "Manganiello,
why, what are you thinking of?"

01:20:59.222 --> 01:21:01.213
It isn't your patriotism,

01:21:01.424 --> 01:21:04.052
it isn't your honor you are betraying.

01:21:04.794 --> 01:21:06.386
It is really you.

01:21:07.630 --> 01:21:09.188
After a while,

01:21:10.066 --> 01:21:13.593
I managed a hearty pat on my back,
smoked another cigar,

01:21:14.003 --> 01:21:17.461
and what did I think? "Let's go.

01:21:18.808 --> 01:21:20.332
"Courage now.

01:21:21.878 --> 01:21:23.778
"Comrade Manganiello?"

01:21:24.614 --> 01:21:26.309
Fight or be beaten.

01:21:27.550 --> 01:21:29.017
It's freezing!

01:21:29.719 --> 01:21:31.846
Hurry. We're going to dance.

01:21:32.622 --> 01:21:34.385
You'll make me fall!

01:22:13.963 --> 01:22:15.157
Come on.

01:22:23.706 --> 01:22:24.798
Thanks.

01:22:24.907 --> 01:22:26.306
If you were what you say,

01:22:26.409 --> 01:22:28.707
you would have agreed
to carry that letter

01:22:28.811 --> 01:22:32.247
and you would have used it
against our friends in Rome.

01:22:39.188 --> 01:22:42.157
Well, take a look.
There's nothing written.

01:22:43.726 --> 01:22:46.559
I thought it best to put you to the test.

01:23:21.564 --> 01:23:23.691
They must stop dancing.

01:23:24.100 --> 01:23:25.294
But why?

01:23:26.936 --> 01:23:28.801
They're both so pretty.

01:23:45.121 --> 01:23:47.487
Well, what's there to stare at?

01:23:47.590 --> 01:23:52.186
This is Paris,
and I'm a fashionable woman, aren't I?

01:23:52.295 --> 01:23:55.389
-You're crazy, completely.
-All right. Let's dance!

01:23:55.498 --> 01:23:57.830
Everyone! All of you!

01:23:58.468 --> 01:24:02.370
Everybody, come on!

01:25:07.537 --> 01:25:10.005
-Tomorrow by car at dawn.
-Wait!

01:25:10.106 --> 01:25:12.666
-What about his wife?
-She doesn't go.

01:25:13.843 --> 01:25:15.538
Better without her.

01:25:16.045 --> 01:25:17.740
We'll meet in Rome!

01:25:18.581 --> 01:25:20.674
And the best of luck to you!

01:26:23.946 --> 01:26:27.245
Who knows what
you think of me, Professor?

01:26:27.350 --> 01:26:29.443
I've had too much champagne!

01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:33.845
It's good for anybody
to get drunk once in a while.

01:26:33.956 --> 01:26:35.651
You won't believe this.

01:26:35.758 --> 01:26:38.454
You upset me like
you're giving me an exam.

01:26:38.561 --> 01:26:41.359
If you're prepared, everybody'll pass?

01:26:54.377 --> 01:26:57.972
Listen. I'll be going tomorrow
with my husband.

01:26:58.814 --> 01:27:00.372
You must remain.

01:27:05.354 --> 01:27:07.845
Please remain in town. Do it for me.

01:27:08.124 --> 01:27:10.217
Didn't you decide to go
with Giulia and me?

01:27:10.326 --> 01:27:13.261
Haven't you observed
she can't stand me, your Giulia?

01:27:13.796 --> 01:27:14.820
Pardon!

01:27:14.931 --> 01:27:17.559
But Giulia's so stupid.
Can't you see she's drunk?

01:27:17.667 --> 01:27:20.033
We've all lost our heads a little tonight.

01:27:20.136 --> 01:27:23.230
Besides, you're mistaken
to say she can't bear you.

01:27:23.339 --> 01:27:26.706
She mentioned that she admires you.

01:27:28.578 --> 01:27:33.709
-What else did she say?
-That she finds you seductive.

01:27:35.551 --> 01:27:37.178
I changed my mind.

01:27:38.487 --> 01:27:43.789
I'll stay with you in Paris. Glad?

01:27:44.193 --> 01:27:47.128
Anna! The Professor
is propositioning me!

01:27:47.430 --> 01:27:48.624
Help!

01:27:48.731 --> 01:27:53.259
I feel so happy that in a minute
I know I'm going to feel terrible!

01:27:53.836 --> 01:27:55.098
Ciao!

01:28:20.062 --> 01:28:24.123
Damn. I'm beginning to get tired.

01:28:39.482 --> 01:28:41.609
-Manganiello.
-Yes, Dottore.

01:28:42.785 --> 01:28:45.583
-I've just had a fantastic dream.
-You did?

01:28:46.155 --> 01:28:47.952
I was in Switzerland.

01:28:48.057 --> 01:28:50.287
And you were taking me
for an operation in a hospital

01:28:50.393 --> 01:28:51.587
because I was blind.

01:28:51.694 --> 01:28:53.821
Switzerland. It's beautiful.

01:28:54.130 --> 01:28:56.462
And Professor Quadri did the operation.

01:28:56.999 --> 01:29:00.457
The operation was a success
and I was leaving soon

01:29:01.170 --> 01:29:04.333
with the wife of the Professor.
And she loved me.

01:29:08.644 --> 01:29:10.043
Switzerland.

01:29:10.413 --> 01:29:12.278
I remember in Milan

01:29:12.381 --> 01:29:14.679
when I was a child,
we used to sing a song.

01:29:14.784 --> 01:29:16.115
Wait a minute.

01:29:39.909 --> 01:29:42.173
In Africa after all that work
and four dead men,

01:29:42.278 --> 01:29:44.974
we discovered
it was no longer necessary.

01:29:45.681 --> 01:29:49.344
And my superior,
"You have ruined us all!

01:29:49.452 --> 01:29:51.545
"You're only beasts, you are!"

01:29:51.654 --> 01:29:55.090
"Now wait a second," I said.
"We are men, not beasts."

01:30:00.696 --> 01:30:02.596
That woman should have
returned to her bed

01:30:02.698 --> 01:30:04.666
and stayed there all day.

01:30:08.003 --> 01:30:09.300
God!

01:30:09.405 --> 01:30:12.670
-Love can certainly...
-What are you trying to say?

01:30:14.777 --> 01:30:16.745
No. Nothing, Dottore.

01:30:17.313 --> 01:30:21.340
No. I was saying that sometimes
love can even perform miracles.

01:30:32.928 --> 01:30:34.054
There!

01:30:36.265 --> 01:30:38.028
It's them, isn't it?

01:30:39.735 --> 01:30:41.703
Keep about 60 feet back.

01:30:58.921 --> 01:31:00.183
There's a car behind us.

01:31:00.289 --> 01:31:01.654
-So?
-Following us.

01:31:01.757 --> 01:31:04.692
Nothing the matter with that.
Why are you so nervous?

01:31:15.704 --> 01:31:17.001
Watch out!

01:31:32.188 --> 01:31:34.383
Must be something the matter.

01:31:34.490 --> 01:31:36.617
Don't get out, please, I beg you!

01:31:36.725 --> 01:31:39.922
-Well, why not?
-I don't know, but I'm frightened.

01:32:27.142 --> 01:32:29.576
We can't just sit here like this.

01:32:29.678 --> 01:32:31.407
I'll be right back.

01:32:32.381 --> 01:32:33.678
Wait here.

01:32:36.352 --> 01:32:37.410
Luca!

01:33:21.563 --> 01:33:23.258
I thought you were ill.

01:33:23.365 --> 01:33:25.959
What is it? What do you want from me?

01:34:58.260 --> 01:35:00.125
Look out, I'm shooting.

01:35:36.865 --> 01:35:39.800
How disgusting. I've always said so.

01:35:39.902 --> 01:35:43.633
Make me work in the shit,
sure, but not with a coward.

01:35:43.739 --> 01:35:46.401
If it's up to me, cowards,
homosexuals and Jews,

01:35:46.508 --> 01:35:47.907
they're all the same thing.

01:35:49.645 --> 01:35:53.081
If it were up to me,
I'd stand them all against a wall.

01:35:56.552 --> 01:36:01.080
Better yet,
eliminate them when they're born.

01:37:38.086 --> 01:37:39.383
Attention.

01:37:41.390 --> 01:37:42.789
Attention.

01:37:44.259 --> 01:37:47.956
His Majesty King Vittorio Emanuele

01:37:48.063 --> 01:37:52.830
accepted the resignation
of His Excellency Benito Mussolini

01:37:53.168 --> 01:37:57.161
as head of the government,
Prime Minister and Secretary of State.

01:37:57.706 --> 01:37:59.469
His Majesty has named as
head of the government,

01:37:59.575 --> 01:38:01.975
Prime Minister and Secretary of State,

01:38:02.077 --> 01:38:06.480
His Excellency Marshal Pietro Badoglio.

01:38:18.961 --> 01:38:22.089
How elegant you are
with your mama's hat on!

01:38:25.934 --> 01:38:28.459
You even put on the foxes
Mama brought from Paris.

01:38:28.570 --> 01:38:29.969
Good for Marta!

01:38:30.072 --> 01:38:33.530
King Vittorio Emanuele has
accepted the resignation

01:38:33.642 --> 01:38:37.339
of His Excellency Benito Mussolini

01:38:37.746 --> 01:38:41.773
as head of the government,
Prime minister and Secretary of State,

01:38:42.317 --> 01:38:44.785
and His Majesty has named as
head of the government,

01:38:44.886 --> 01:38:47.821
Prime minister and Secretary of State,

01:38:47.923 --> 01:38:51.222
His Excellency Marshal Pietro Badoglio.

01:39:16.818 --> 01:39:18.479
A red apple.

01:39:22.090 --> 01:39:25.389
Ready? Hail Mary, full of grace...

01:39:25.494 --> 01:39:27.587
"Hail Mary, full of grace..."

01:39:27.696 --> 01:39:30.756
-the Lord is with Thee.
-"the Lord is with Thee."

01:39:30.866 --> 01:39:35.496
-Blessed art Thou amongst women...
-"Blessed art Thou amongst women..."

01:39:36.204 --> 01:39:39.367
...and blessed is the fruit
of Thy womb, Jesus.

01:39:40.976 --> 01:39:43.444
"...the fruit of Thy womb, Jesus."

01:39:44.513 --> 01:39:46.606
Holy Mary, Mother of God...

01:39:47.716 --> 01:39:49.946
"Holy Mary, Mother of God..."

01:39:50.052 --> 01:39:52.577
...pray for us sinners...

01:39:52.688 --> 01:39:54.849
"...pray for us sinners..."

01:39:54.956 --> 01:39:59.620
-...now and at the hour of our death.
-"...now and at the hour of our death."

01:39:59.728 --> 01:40:00.956
Italo called.

01:40:01.063 --> 01:40:03.395
-Amen.
-"Amen."

01:40:05.100 --> 01:40:08.092
Now to sleep.
Come on, lie down and sleep.

01:40:12.274 --> 01:40:15.675
-Italo?
-Yes. Italo.

01:40:20.349 --> 01:40:23.978
-What did he want?
-He'll expect you at the usual place.

01:40:27.622 --> 01:40:30.420
Italo. After all this time.

01:40:38.433 --> 01:40:40.424
How awful they all are!

01:40:41.103 --> 01:40:43.731
Celebrating because
the King threw out Mussolini,

01:40:43.839 --> 01:40:46.330
when yesterday they were all for him.

01:40:46.441 --> 01:40:48.671
I can't wait till we get them out of here.

01:40:48.777 --> 01:40:51.302
Why see Italo? What's the use of it?

01:40:52.147 --> 01:40:55.310
If he called it means he needs me,
and I'm going.

01:40:57.219 --> 01:40:59.949
I was always the one
who took him around.

01:41:00.555 --> 01:41:02.386
I took him everywhere.

01:41:03.658 --> 01:41:06.627
He used to say that
when I described things to him

01:41:06.728 --> 01:41:09.492
it was like seeing them
with his own eyes.

01:41:10.632 --> 01:41:12.031
Go to sleep.

01:41:14.035 --> 01:41:15.764
Marcello, you've got to take care,
you hear?

01:41:15.871 --> 01:41:16.895
Why?

01:41:17.839 --> 01:41:19.431
What do you mean?

01:41:21.777 --> 01:41:22.971
Nothing.

01:41:26.381 --> 01:41:29.873
Wait, listen.
What are you going to do now?

01:41:29.985 --> 01:41:32.783
The same as everyone else
who thought like me.

01:41:34.823 --> 01:41:37.257
When there are so many of us,
there's no risk.

01:41:37.359 --> 01:41:40.692
I know, but I want to say
the business with Quadri...

01:41:53.308 --> 01:41:56.004
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:41:59.281 --> 01:42:01.374
In Paris, Anna,

01:42:02.717 --> 01:42:05.413
maybe in order
to get me away from you,

01:42:05.954 --> 01:42:08.650
told me you worked
for the secret police.

01:42:11.026 --> 01:42:14.860
-And you? What did you answer?
-That it wasn't important.

01:42:15.230 --> 01:42:17.824
That I was your wife and I loved you.

01:42:19.067 --> 01:42:22.230
And if you worked for them,
it was your decision.

01:42:26.141 --> 01:42:30.339
But then, when the Quadris were killed,

01:42:30.445 --> 01:42:33.972
how scared I became.

01:42:41.990 --> 01:42:44.288
And what do you think of it now?

01:42:49.197 --> 01:42:51.529
Well, I think that, after all,

01:42:54.202 --> 01:42:56.932
it was an important step in your career.

01:42:57.839 --> 01:42:59.272
That's right.

01:43:02.177 --> 01:43:04.042
Marcello, don't go out!

01:43:08.617 --> 01:43:10.380
They could hurt you.

01:43:10.585 --> 01:43:12.485
I won't be in danger.

01:43:13.655 --> 01:43:16.283
After all, what have I done? My duty.

01:43:16.958 --> 01:43:18.949
But why do you want to go?

01:43:20.862 --> 01:43:23.592
I want to see how a dictatorship falls.

01:43:36.077 --> 01:43:39.535
Mama! Where are you? I'm afraid.

01:43:41.650 --> 01:43:43.845
I'm here, darling. I'm coming.

01:44:01.136 --> 01:44:02.364
Marcello?

01:44:08.076 --> 01:44:10.977
There's something
that's still stuck to you.

01:44:12.514 --> 01:44:14.414
-Where?
-Here.

01:44:15.417 --> 01:44:16.645
Oh, yes.

01:44:57.125 --> 01:44:58.490
What about eating?

01:44:58.593 --> 01:45:01.118
As long as there are cats around,
I manage.

01:45:01.229 --> 01:45:03.891
They say cat meat tastes like rabbit.

01:45:03.999 --> 01:45:05.933
Too bad we didn't meet yesterday.

01:45:06.034 --> 01:45:08.093
I had a whipped cream cake at home.

01:45:08.203 --> 01:45:10.330
-With real cream?
-Yes, why not?

01:45:10.438 --> 01:45:12.998
-You need eggs for that.
-Somebody I met lives in the country.

01:45:13.108 --> 01:45:14.700
He sends me bread, too.

01:45:14.809 --> 01:45:17.073
Fresh eggs? Bread?

01:45:17.178 --> 01:45:20.045
He keeps me supplied.
I never lack for anything in my house.

01:45:20.148 --> 01:45:22.514
Chickens, butter, fresh cheese.

01:45:22.617 --> 01:45:25.245
-And potatoes?
-Potatoes, too.

01:45:25.353 --> 01:45:27.844
If you come home with me,
I'll be happy to make you an omelet.

01:45:27.956 --> 01:45:30.049
-What kind?
-A jelly omelet.

01:45:30.492 --> 01:45:32.255
You must be tired
of eating cats all the time.

01:45:32.360 --> 01:45:35.955
Yes. I ate too many of them.
And they're not so easy to find.

01:45:36.064 --> 01:45:38.794
-What did you do?
-Ate mice.

01:45:38.900 --> 01:45:40.561
There are more rats with the cats gone?

01:45:40.669 --> 01:45:42.637
Yes, but they're all skin and bones.

01:45:42.737 --> 01:45:44.136
Listen. I don't live far from here.

01:45:44.239 --> 01:45:46.833
Why don't you come
and have dinner with me?

01:45:47.275 --> 01:45:49.402
-Is there a place to sleep?
-You can stay.

01:45:49.511 --> 01:45:52.503
Nice shoes you have. Soft.

01:45:52.881 --> 01:45:54.212
They were a present.

01:45:54.315 --> 01:45:56.943
I got a present, too. A Siamese cat.

01:45:57.052 --> 01:45:59.020
-Was he good?
-Too tough.

01:45:59.954 --> 01:46:02.514
I have a pair of suede shoes.
You can have them.

01:46:02.624 --> 01:46:06.355
And I have a nice oriental kimono.
Like Madame Butterfly's.

01:46:06.494 --> 01:46:08.223
You know who Madame Butterfly is?

01:46:08.329 --> 01:46:09.387
Lino!

01:46:10.231 --> 01:46:14.429
-Is your name Lino? You!
-Me? Why?

01:46:15.704 --> 01:46:18.332
You were a chauffeur, right?

01:46:18.840 --> 01:46:22.435
-But a long time ago.
-Yes.

01:46:27.048 --> 01:46:31.883
-You had a pistol.
-I? I don't understand you.

01:46:33.421 --> 01:46:35.286
And you're alive still.

01:46:35.924 --> 01:46:38.324
But I don't know you.
What do you want of me?

01:46:38.426 --> 01:46:40.053
What's that scar?

01:46:40.829 --> 01:46:42.922
-There was an accident.
-What accident?

01:46:43.031 --> 01:46:44.555
What do you want?
Take your hands off me!

01:46:44.666 --> 01:46:45.928
Where were you?

01:46:46.034 --> 01:46:48.628
What were you doing
on March 25, 1917?

01:46:49.070 --> 01:46:51.504
Me? I... Who are you?
You must be crazy.

01:46:51.606 --> 01:46:54.404
What were you doing
on March 25, 1917?

01:46:54.509 --> 01:46:55.908
Let me alone!

01:46:56.010 --> 01:46:58.171
And the 15th of October, 1938.

01:46:58.279 --> 01:47:00.406
Where were you?
What were you doing?

01:47:01.216 --> 01:47:05.482
What were you doing at 4:00 p.m.
on October 15th, 1938?

01:47:05.587 --> 01:47:07.578
Where were you?
What were you doing?

01:47:07.689 --> 01:47:11.125
What were you doing? I've got to know.

01:47:12.694 --> 01:47:15.925
Murderer! Murderer!

01:47:18.066 --> 01:47:21.832
He killed a man, a political exile,

01:47:22.670 --> 01:47:25.662
on October 15th, 1938!

01:47:26.040 --> 01:47:27.905
Yes, Professor Quadri!

01:47:28.243 --> 01:47:29.642
Luca Quadri!

01:47:30.411 --> 01:47:33.141
And his wife Anna Quadri.

01:47:36.518 --> 01:47:39.544
He's a homosexual, a Fascist!

01:47:40.221 --> 01:47:42.314
And his name is Pasqualino!

01:47:44.025 --> 01:47:45.356
Semirama!

01:47:46.261 --> 01:47:48.320
Pasqualino Semirama!

01:47:48.596 --> 01:47:52.862
Marcello, don't do that.

01:47:55.837 --> 01:47:57.805
Marcello, where are you?

01:47:59.073 --> 01:48:01.439
-Fascist!
-No, Marcello!

01:48:01.543 --> 01:48:04.671
He, too, is a Fascist. Right here.

01:48:04.779 --> 01:48:06.644
-What are you doing this for?
-This one's a Fascist.

01:48:06.748 --> 01:48:10.514
Marcello, no. No, Marcello, please.

01:48:10.618 --> 01:48:12.677
Marcello, no, no, Marcello!

01:48:13.721 --> 01:48:16.747
Italo Montanari! Fascist!

01:48:16.858 --> 01:48:18.689
No, Marcello. Are you crazy?

01:48:18.793 --> 01:48:22.490
Marcello, why are you doing this?
Please, come back here.

01:48:24.432 --> 01:48:27.265
Marcello. Marcello!

01:48:28.703 --> 01:48:31.968
Marcello! Marcello!
