16:34.770 --> 16:37.364
they've decided to treat you like adults.

16:37.439 --> 16:40.636

Your criminal past,

This will be base camp..

Try not to kill each other.

20:06.348 --> 20:08.873
Yo, Crazy!

20:08.951 --> 20:10.942
Let me check that out.

20:16.125 --> 20:18.650
Too small for me.

20:18.727 --> 20:20.058
Go do mine now.

20:21.530 --> 20:23.327
Your ears don't work?

20:23.398 --> 20:25.195
Go ahead!

20:33.108 --> 20:34.473
You do good work.

20:34.543 --> 20:38.274
The rest of you drag-asses,
you need help?

20:38.347 --> 20:40.872
When he's done with mine...

20:40.949 --> 20:44.009
I might rent you Crazy here.

21:03.438 --> 21:05.872
That's not bad.
What's in here anyway?

21:05.941 --> 21:10.878
Cattail, milkweed, wild onion,

What's this chewy stuff?

21:12.648 --> 21:14.377
Snails.

21:20.289 --> 21:21.551
Snails them worms in a shell?

21:23.992 --> 21:25.220
Main course.

21:28.096 --> 21:29.893
Worms! I can't eat this!

21:29.965 --> 21:31.796
It's zoo food!
I want a cheeseburger.

21:31.867 --> 21:33.425
Escargot and frog legs.

21:33.502 --> 21:36.266
You know what this would set you back
at Regine's in the Grove?

21:36.338 --> 21:37.862
About a hundred with the wine.

22:07.903 --> 22:11.566
Yo, I can't wait!

22:11.640 --> 22:14.438
It's gonna be your ass

23:10.132 --> 23:12.692
Hey, <i>chango.</i>

- You're pulling it too tight!
- Yo, Carlos, man! Shut up!

24:49.164 --> 24:51.428

24:53.001 --> 24:55.936
- Let me pull...
- Don't let that fish go!

24:56.004 --> 24:57.665
Don't, Moss!

24:57.739 --> 24:59.832
That fish'll take one look at you,
and run the other way!

24:59.908 --> 25:02.103
- Don't be stupid, man!
- You're gonna lose it!

25:02.177 --> 25:03.838
- Get it, Moss! Get it!

25:03.912 --> 25:05.072
You're pulling it too tight!

25:05.147 --> 25:06.637
Come on, Moss, man!

25:06.715 --> 25:08.774

25:43.952 --> 25:45.886
He took two hits.

25:45.954 --> 25:48.320
That's a lot of venom.

25:48.390 --> 25:52.520
I shot him up.
He's got a fifty-fifty chance.

25:52.594 --> 25:56.030
<i>Mi pana,</i> Flaco,

26:22.991 --> 26:26.586
Okay. Okay, breathe.

26:26.661 --> 26:28.356
Easy.

26:29.931 --> 26:31.831
Easy.

26:33.001 --> 26:36.493
<i>Oye! El Rattler</i> lives!

28:20.842 --> 28:24.642
Nikki. Come in.

28:24.713 --> 28:26.476
Thank you for seeing me,
Mr. Quintana.

28:26.548 --> 28:29.847
Sit down. Have a drink.
Felix.

28:30.952 --> 28:34.012
No, that's all right.
Thank you, Mr. Quintana.

28:38.827 --> 28:41.091
Maybe Perrier.

28:56.978 --> 28:58.570
Have you heard from Carlos?

28:58.647 --> 29:02.447
Not a word.
Nothing.

29:02.517 --> 29:05.145
I've been making calls.
I can't find out where he is.

29:06.154 --> 29:08.088
I thought you might know.

29:18.199 --> 29:20.565
One day I went to see him
at the youth hall.

29:20.635 --> 29:22.660
The next day he was gone.

29:23.772 --> 29:27.139
They tell me your family
has money up in Palm Beach.

29:27.208 --> 29:29.039
I don't talk to them.

29:29.110 --> 29:32.045
They don't talk to each other,
and they don't care what I do.

29:32.113 --> 29:34.081
Works out fine.

29:34.149 --> 29:35.707
How old are you?

29:37.152 --> 29:38.176
Sixteen.

29:43.725 --> 29:46.091
Good. Smart girl.

29:46.161 --> 29:49.653
You know how to handle yourself.

29:50.832 --> 29:54.029
You think you'll be able to find out
where Carlos is and get him out?

29:55.470 --> 29:58.564
Sure. Sure I will.

30:00.375 --> 30:02.935
Now you go upstairs
into the bedroom.

30:03.011 --> 30:04.137
Take off your clothes.

30:04.212 --> 30:06.646
I got a few more things
to take care of down here...

30:06.715 --> 30:07.773
and then I'll come up.

30:23.498 --> 30:29.164
I said go upstairs,
take off your fucking clothes.

33:56.711 --> 33:58.702
A cloven hoof.

34:00.114 --> 34:01.479
Wild boar.

34:01.549 --> 34:03.983
We'll find other game.
Nobody hunts boar.

34:04.052 --> 34:07.317
Except a few wild men who think
they're good eating.

34:44.425 --> 34:47.393
- Let's get out of here! Move it!
- Oh, shit!

34:50.898 --> 34:52.991
- Hurry up!
- Keep going, man!

34:53.067 --> 34:55.501
It thinks we're stick people!

34:59.574 --> 35:02.065
<i>Jesucristo!</i>

35:03.745 --> 35:05.372
Hurry up, Moss!

35:10.351 --> 35:12.410
- Move guys!
- Shit!

35:12.487 --> 35:13.681
Hey, wait a minute!

35:13.755 --> 35:15.450
- Get out of my way, man!
- Hey, come on!

35:20.662 --> 35:24.393
Shit, that thing is ugly, man!

35:35.410 --> 35:37.503
Come on, guys!
Let's get him!

36:20.688 --> 36:22.178
Man, barbecue!

36:22.256 --> 36:25.987
All we need is some rib sauce
from Mokey's on 27 th Avenue.

36:26.060 --> 36:28.551
Man, this is a lot better
than an alley cat.

36:31.532 --> 36:35.525
I ate an alley cat once
goin' through Detroit.

36:39.340 --> 36:41.535
Detroit? Miami.

36:41.609 --> 36:43.099
<i>Calle Ocho,</i> Little Havana!

36:43.177 --> 36:45.975
27 th Avenue! Get down and boogie!

36:49.117 --> 36:51.847
- Nikki.
- Oh, man! Nikki again.

36:51.919 --> 36:54.854
Lots of mommies happy
when Ruben hits the streets.

36:54.922 --> 36:56.947
And what's they doin'
while you away, homie?

36:57.024 --> 36:58.821
Improvin' themselves.

36:58.893 --> 37:00.793
Like us. Ask this guy.

37:00.862 --> 37:02.193
You can say that again.

37:02.263 --> 37:04.731
- Don't mess with the best.
- Exam time.

37:04.799 --> 37:08.565
Map. Compass.

37:10.371 --> 37:11.998
Destination is marked.

37:14.108 --> 37:16.702
You track me, you should get out alive.

37:26.187 --> 37:27.484
See ya.

37:28.489 --> 37:29.888
He's joking, ain't he?

37:55.583 --> 37:57.676
We've been through here already.

38:00.321 --> 38:02.812
Which way's what, man?

38:02.890 --> 38:04.482
Rattler's got the map.

38:17.104 --> 38:19.698
I can't read.

38:19.774 --> 38:22.140
Oh, shit!

38:22.210 --> 38:25.407
- Why didn't you tell us before, man?
- Because I didn't!

38:35.523 --> 38:37.081
That way.

38:40.628 --> 38:43.791
<i>Oye,</i> Carlos!
Can you read, man?

39:01.582 --> 39:03.413
Hey, wait up,J.L.

39:09.824 --> 39:13.817
We gotta keep moving northeast.
That way.

39:13.895 --> 39:16.159
Man, you lostJoe's trail.
Let me see.

39:16.230 --> 39:18.926
Man, you don't know shit, man.
Give me that compass!

39:19.000 --> 39:21.764
- Give me the compass!
- No way, Jose!

39:38.286 --> 39:40.220
Now what you gonna do?

39:46.861 --> 39:50.126
- I'm gonna kill you this time, spick.
- Stop!

39:50.197 --> 39:52.131
I'm gonna kill you!

39:52.199 --> 39:53.962
Stop!

40:02.443 --> 40:03.910
What are you doin'?

40:06.280 --> 40:10.910
If we don't learn to live,
we're gonna die likeJoe said, man.

40:10.985 --> 40:12.680
So come on!

40:19.827 --> 40:21.692
Come on!

40:23.264 --> 40:26.825
You lost the compass, find it!

40:28.769 --> 40:30.703
Now!

40:32.506 --> 40:34.201
Assholes.

40:41.115 --> 40:44.346
Saw grass.
Cut the shit outta you!

41:08.909 --> 41:11.969
Piss on this.
This is worse than work.

41:16.784 --> 41:19.252
My turn.
You're havin' all the fun.

42:28.422 --> 42:30.686
Northeast, almost.

42:41.735 --> 42:44.533
Whoever's snoring,
shut the hell up!

42:49.610 --> 42:50.736
Wake up!

43:01.589 --> 43:03.580
Gimme a stick! Come on, guys!

43:03.657 --> 43:06.023
- Get outta here!
- Do something!

43:06.093 --> 43:08.152
- Get outta here!
- Yeah. Get out of here!

43:08.229 --> 43:12.188
I done fought everything, but I never
fought a bear! Get outta here!

43:12.266 --> 43:14.166
Oh, Joe!

43:34.088 --> 43:38.457
Hey, wake up!
Smokey the Bear's gone.

44:00.181 --> 44:02.308
Panther.

44:26.707 --> 44:28.971
Maybe the compass is broken.

44:30.978 --> 44:32.445
Check it against the North Star.

44:34.014 --> 44:37.211
There's no North Star!
It's still daylight!

44:37.284 --> 44:40.412
- Check it against the sun.
- Another night.

44:40.487 --> 44:43.456
And more water!
More water!

44:47.361 --> 44:48.919
Listen.

46:53.487 --> 46:55.148
Hey, look!

46:56.623 --> 46:58.420
Joe! It's Joe!

46:58.492 --> 47:00.824
Right there!
Look! Joe!

47:00.894 --> 47:03.556
- We made it!
- All right!

47:03.630 --> 47:05.530
How you doin', man?

47:05.599 --> 47:08.261
- Hey, we made it, man!
- Hey, man, we saw a panther!

47:08.335 --> 47:10.303
- Anyone else see a panther?
- How'd those guys do?

47:10.371 --> 47:12.999
- Weren't no others.
- What?

47:13.073 --> 47:14.267
You're the first.

47:17.044 --> 47:19.478
The first?
What do you mean, the first?

47:20.681 --> 47:22.842
We could've died out there.

47:22.916 --> 47:24.110
We're the first, man.

47:24.184 --> 47:27.017
That's right man.
We're <i>numero uno.</i>

47:27.087 --> 47:29.487
Yeah, we the best!
We number one! All right!

47:29.556 --> 47:31.080
We the shit!

47:32.393 --> 47:33.826
You ready for Miami?

47:35.496 --> 47:37.623
You mean, we're out?
Free?

47:37.698 --> 47:39.325
No.

47:44.438 --> 47:47.168
I got us a house.

47:47.241 --> 47:49.436
Program's movin' to Miami.

49:06.720 --> 49:08.779
This is it?

49:11.792 --> 49:16.252
- How'd you get this house?
- From the city. Dollar a year.

49:16.330 --> 49:18.127
Well, you got screwed.

50:39.580 --> 50:42.344
What are we supposed to do with them?
Haitians is scurvy!

50:42.416 --> 50:44.145
- No shit.
- What do you wanna do with 'em?

50:44.217 --> 50:46.151
- Throw 'em out!
- Junkies too, man!

50:46.219 --> 50:48.312
Hey, man, they're the worst!
They'll sell you out for a nickel bag!

50:48.388 --> 50:51.551
I am <i>puertorriqueño,</i> man!
I ain't no raggedy-ass Haitian!

50:51.625 --> 50:53.115
And look at this place.
It's disgusting!

50:53.193 --> 50:55.559
- It's not so bad.
- Yeah, it looks like home to you.

50:55.629 --> 50:57.563
Man, look, what are we doin',
runnin' a hotel, here?

50:59.032 --> 51:01.193
You guys afraid you haven't
got enough to go around?

51:01.268 --> 51:02.292
Around what?

51:02.369 --> 51:05.202
Around the block for a bit of shit?
Yo, there's junkies here!

51:05.272 --> 51:08.241
- Same question goes.
- What's that?

51:08.308 --> 51:10.902
- You got the balls?
- To what?

51:16.483 --> 51:18.417
Cut it in Miami.

51:18.485 --> 51:21.420
- Cut the shit, okay, man?
- Man, what the hell does that mean?

51:21.488 --> 51:23.080
- Hey, man...
- Shut up!

51:26.860 --> 51:29.351
Is that in our house?

51:43.010 --> 51:44.944
What'd you take
those boards down for?

51:45.012 --> 51:48.004
- We use this place the way it is.
- We're movin' in. You're movin' out.

51:48.081 --> 51:49.776
Oh, yeah?
Well, who's doin' the movin'?

51:49.850 --> 51:50.908
We are!

51:50.984 --> 51:53.578
I'll bust you upside your head!

51:55.489 --> 51:59.357
- You want us, we'll be in the park.
- Well, go on right now!

51:59.426 --> 52:02.418
Get outta here! Give me a hand.
He weighs a lot for a junkie.

52:04.264 --> 52:06.459
Get your ass across the street.

52:55.449 --> 52:56.939
I do not believe this.

52:57.017 --> 52:59.110
I don't believe this!

52:59.186 --> 53:01.950
This is who you let
run you outta the house, man?

53:02.022 --> 53:05.287
Five punks and Tonto.

53:06.927 --> 53:08.690
What's this sign here?

53:08.762 --> 53:14.530
Ain't no pimps and pushers around here.
You see any?

53:22.042 --> 53:23.373
Hey, who was that?

53:23.443 --> 53:27.436
That's Cream. Everybody knows him.
He runs this part of town.

53:27.514 --> 53:31.245
Yo, nobody messes with that man,
not even the police.

53:34.287 --> 53:37.484
- What are we gonna do about that?
- Nothing. Mail this.

53:38.759 --> 53:40.624
Here's $125.

53:40.694 --> 53:43.185
You take that to Power and Gas
over on the Avenue.

53:43.263 --> 53:45.094
The man will show you
where to sign your name.

53:45.165 --> 53:46.757
You learned that already.

54:01.681 --> 54:02.670
Hey, Joe?

54:03.984 --> 54:05.713
What's to keep me from takin' a hike?

54:08.121 --> 54:09.918
Nothing.

54:49.129 --> 54:50.926
I gotta go.

55:02.642 --> 55:03.973
Hey, Aldo!

55:04.044 --> 55:07.138
Hey, Carlos! My man!
You look different, huh?

55:07.214 --> 55:10.741
Gina, this is my main man, Carlos.
We did some bad moves together.

55:10.817 --> 55:13.012
Listen, your timing is perfect,
man, okay?

55:13.086 --> 55:16.112
Because Gina's got a little friend
who's gonna be flyin' by later on.

55:16.189 --> 55:19.158
- You get a line on Nikki?
- Crystal's a major fox!

55:19.226 --> 55:22.889
I gotta find Nikki.
Okay, I'll be in touch.

55:22.963 --> 55:23.952
Carlos.

55:25.732 --> 55:28.667
I don't got a phone number,
but I got an address. It's in the Grove.

55:28.735 --> 55:31.431
You go dressed like that,
you're gonna get busted for nothin'.

55:31.504 --> 55:33.870
Come on up.

56:08.708 --> 56:10.642
All right, all right.

56:27.694 --> 56:30.891
You don't know how much
I've been missing you.

56:42.042 --> 56:44.306
Hey, whose place is this?

56:45.779 --> 56:47.269
Mine.

56:52.953 --> 56:55.114
Talking to your father now?

56:55.188 --> 56:58.021
Uh-uh. Never.

56:59.793 --> 57:03.058
A condo like this is big dollars.

57:03.129 --> 57:06.394
Well, it's not exactly mine.

57:07.400 --> 57:09.994
Kathy, you know,
my friend from Palm Beach?

57:10.904 --> 57:13.429
She's in Europe.
She lent it to me.

57:20.046 --> 57:23.413
- Men's cologne. This Kathy's?
- That's mine.

57:24.384 --> 57:27.547
I use it. It's fun.

57:29.723 --> 57:32.886
What's going down?

57:32.959 --> 57:35.519
Why was it so hard
to find you?

57:40.133 --> 57:42.124
I'm in the business now.

57:45.171 --> 57:49.835
- I'm working for Nestor.
- Working for Nestor.

58:02.522 --> 58:05.616
- You're fucking him!
- No, Carlos. I swear.

58:05.692 --> 58:08.718
You bitch!
You lying whore! You <i>puta!</i>

58:08.795 --> 58:12.561
Wait! Carlos, you don't know!

58:12.632 --> 58:15.465
- I know enough!
- Listen, please!

58:18.571 --> 58:21.039
Carlos! Wait!

58:27.047 --> 58:31.814
Carlito.
You're looking good.

58:31.885 --> 58:35.480
Nikki, come here.

58:57.444 --> 58:59.378
Now you got nothin'.

59:00.513 --> 59:02.003
Go on.

59:02.082 --> 59:04.642
Get lost.
You're out of Miami.

59:24.871 --> 59:27.704
Hey, yo, man! Look, man!
Hey, look, man!

59:41.187 --> 59:43.155
Hey, man, we heard
you livin' here with them.

59:43.223 --> 59:45.157
You swore you were gonna
waste that nigger!

59:45.225 --> 59:46.988
Hey, man, you watch it!

59:48.928 --> 59:50.759
Quiet!

59:52.499 --> 59:54.524
I been waiting on them brushes.
What's up?

59:54.601 --> 59:57.593
- You got it.
- Oh, what?

59:57.670 --> 01:00:01.436
- We don't take that shit.
- What you talkin' about?

01:00:01.508 --> 01:00:03.669
Yo, cupcake!

01:00:05.411 --> 01:00:10.405
- You paint like my Aunt Mary!
- Hey, man, what you doin', paintin'?

01:00:10.483 --> 01:00:13.043
- Hey, look at that, man!
- Hey, yo, Rembrandt!

01:00:15.421 --> 01:00:17.753
You ain't worth a shit, man!

01:00:19.292 --> 01:00:22.819
Moss is painting himself
yellow like a chicken!

01:00:25.098 --> 01:00:27.658
Think you can do better, jack-off?

01:00:29.369 --> 01:00:32.236
Home slice! You don't see
those spots you missin'?

01:00:32.305 --> 01:00:35.206
- Got your contact lenses in?
<i>- Mira,</i> Chooch.

01:00:35.275 --> 01:00:38.039
Not on the glass, man, okay?
And don't get the yellow on the pink!

01:00:38.111 --> 01:00:40.375
- What you wearin' a doo-rag like that?
- Yo! What you doing over here?

01:00:40.446 --> 01:00:44.075
Yo, bubble butt!
Yo, how's your sister Yolanda?

01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:46.778
Yo, man, Moss, your guys
are really bad, man.

01:00:46.853 --> 01:00:48.718
Look what they doin', man.
They gettin' paint everywhere.

01:00:48.788 --> 01:00:50.813
<i>Oye,</i> the lover!

01:00:50.890 --> 01:00:54.053
I knew you'd be back, man.
You was just horny.

01:00:55.128 --> 01:00:57.119
Catch them vines!

01:00:57.197 --> 01:00:59.256
Silk, baby.

01:00:59.332 --> 01:01:03.268
This Nikki, she got a sister?
When we gonna see her?

01:01:07.707 --> 01:01:09.641
Antoine's going to plant a garden.

01:01:18.985 --> 01:01:20.919
Good.

01:01:33.466 --> 01:01:35.730
- I'm glad we could get...
- Hold on, hold on.

01:01:37.470 --> 01:01:41.270
Get Harvey and Inez. Ask them if they
want to eat at Cats tonight, okay?

01:01:41.341 --> 01:01:43.309
<i>Yes, Mr. Chavez.</i>

01:01:45.278 --> 01:01:47.872
- You'reJoe Tigre.
- You've read the reports.

01:01:47.947 --> 01:01:50.177
We're coming up
for 90-day funding...

01:01:50.250 --> 01:01:52.184
I haven't gotten to them.
I'll try this weekend.

01:01:52.252 --> 01:01:54.618
The funding review
is set for Tuesday.

01:01:54.687 --> 01:01:57.884
<i>They said they'll meet you</i>
<i>for dinner at 8:00.</i>

01:01:57.957 --> 01:02:01.017
Thank you.
Sorry. You were saying?

01:02:01.794 --> 01:02:04.024
The funding review is Tuesday.
I'd like to know where you stand.

01:02:04.097 --> 01:02:08.193
- Campaigning, are we?
- Where do you stand?

01:02:08.268 --> 01:02:09.895
- How's it going?
- Good.

01:02:09.969 --> 01:02:13.063
- Is it all in the reports?
- Yes.

01:02:13.139 --> 01:02:15.835
Well, then I don't have
to read them, do I?

01:02:15.908 --> 01:02:17.876
Then you'll approve?

01:02:17.944 --> 01:02:19.935
Well, we try these programs on.

01:02:20.013 --> 01:02:22.811
They look good on paper.
Draws federal funds.

01:02:22.882 --> 01:02:26.716
But the fact is we find out that
half the personnel are moving junk.

01:02:26.786 --> 01:02:29.380
Three months ago,
we had a halfway house for girls...

01:02:29.455 --> 01:02:31.389
running an outcall service
on the side.

01:02:31.457 --> 01:02:34.426
- Look, I'm running late, so...
- Listen, friend.

01:02:34.494 --> 01:02:36.621
This program is important.

01:02:36.696 --> 01:02:40.063
Last one you had, two of your kids
got killed robbing a 7-Eleven.

01:02:40.133 --> 01:02:42.761
That halfway house you had
in Overtown, real successful.

01:02:42.835 --> 01:02:47.238
Listen to me. Each of these kids
has learned how to survive.

01:02:47.307 --> 01:02:50.208
Each one of these kids
has learned self-esteem.

01:02:50.276 --> 01:02:53.541
Each of these kids
means something to himself now.

01:02:53.613 --> 01:02:55.547
Now that means
that other people's lives...

01:02:55.615 --> 01:02:57.810
other people's rights
mean something too.

01:02:57.884 --> 01:03:01.081
You understand?
They've changed.

01:03:01.154 --> 01:03:06.490
We've broken down
the gang barriers, the race barriers.

01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:13.059
They work together. A team.
A band. The program works.

01:03:13.866 --> 01:03:16.096
How long you had these ideas?

01:03:17.103 --> 01:03:19.435
What the hell is wrong
with my ideas?

01:03:20.606 --> 01:03:24.167
One of your kids gets busted...
misdemeanor, spitting on the sidewalk...

01:03:24.243 --> 01:03:27.110
I'm gonna put 'em all back
where they belong.

01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:28.738
I'll see you on Tuesday.

01:04:21.768 --> 01:04:23.099
Stay out!

01:04:25.838 --> 01:04:27.328
That's enough!

01:04:29.375 --> 01:04:32.435
That's enough!
I said that's enough!

01:04:32.512 --> 01:04:36.107
- Gotta teach 'em some respect!
- There's another way!

01:05:23.629 --> 01:05:25.529
Get out of here, bitch!

01:05:29.135 --> 01:05:31.035
Don't bring your ass back!

01:05:31.103 --> 01:05:34.004
You mothers! Get out!

01:05:36.409 --> 01:05:40.846
Carlos, cool it! Get off him!
I said get off him!

01:05:43.616 --> 01:05:45.516
Get outta here!

01:05:52.024 --> 01:05:54.492
All right! All right!

01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:58.121
- They ran like skeeter-jeeter.
- You know it, baby!

01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:05.398
- I told you all to stay out of it.
- You want us to watch you get killed?

01:06:26.192 --> 01:06:29.025
- Move it out.
- Come on, give it back.

01:06:32.365 --> 01:06:34.299
Let's go!

01:06:35.368 --> 01:06:37.097
All right!

01:06:59.225 --> 01:07:02.683
You have got to be kidding, right?

01:07:02.762 --> 01:07:04.696
I mean, what you gonna do, Tonto?

01:07:04.764 --> 01:07:06.755
You gonna take over
my territory?

01:07:10.403 --> 01:07:12.997
Don't you know
this park is mine?

01:07:17.410 --> 01:07:19.537
You lookin' to die, Tonto?

01:07:23.916 --> 01:07:27.181
Yeah. Now you wisin' up.

01:07:33.726 --> 01:07:35.455
Tell them to put down the guns.

01:07:40.066 --> 01:07:43.365
- Now!
- Put 'em down.

01:07:47.306 --> 01:07:48.967
I said put 'em down.

01:07:57.984 --> 01:08:02.045
- All of'em.
- You heard him!

01:08:10.930 --> 01:08:13.922
Collect 'em.
Don't play with 'em.

01:08:26.845 --> 01:08:29.406
You should've killed me, Tonto.

01:08:29.482 --> 01:08:32.609
- You should've killed me.
- You get outta here!

01:08:33.919 --> 01:08:35.853
And you take this with you!

01:08:36.856 --> 01:08:40.587
Move! Move!
Get out!

01:09:43.923 --> 01:09:45.857
That's enough!

01:09:45.925 --> 01:09:49.986
You want to use a gun, you start with
respect, not your barrio bullshit!

01:09:50.062 --> 01:09:55.159
You pop off rounds, the only one gets
hurt is a kid in an upstairs window.

01:10:23.262 --> 01:10:25.992
- I'm not backin' up anymore.
- What does that mean?

01:10:27.399 --> 01:10:29.526
Too many losses.

01:10:31.904 --> 01:10:34.532
- Lost the guys.
- What guys?

01:10:34.607 --> 01:10:36.541
The Band.

01:10:37.977 --> 01:10:41.310
I lost the kids
back to the streets.

01:10:41.380 --> 01:10:45.077
They OD'd. Got shot down
in nickel and dime robberies.

01:10:45.151 --> 01:10:47.881
All the kids before you.
All the programs.

01:10:47.953 --> 01:10:51.719
I lost all the causes.
I lost all the people.

01:10:54.894 --> 01:10:57.089
I'm not backin' up anymore.

01:10:59.465 --> 01:11:02.434
I'm not losing to Cream
when he comes.

01:11:05.838 --> 01:11:07.328
You changed.

01:11:08.674 --> 01:11:12.508
The streets don't change.
The streets will curve you back in.

01:11:12.578 --> 01:11:15.411
You can't change the people
without changing the environment.

01:11:16.215 --> 01:11:20.345
We cleaned up this house.
We cleaned out the park.

01:11:20.419 --> 01:11:23.786
Next come the streets.
It's a straight line, see?

01:11:33.933 --> 01:11:37.528
- What part of the program is this?
- This is my part of the program.

01:11:37.603 --> 01:11:40.436
- Since when?
- Since right now.

01:11:41.373 --> 01:11:43.773
You kids are out.
You're not part of this.

01:11:47.112 --> 01:11:49.103
You got what they call
"self-esteem" now.

01:11:49.949 --> 01:11:52.110
Class is over.
You graduated.

01:11:53.185 --> 01:11:57.053
You kids are gonna boogie.
That's okay.

01:11:57.122 --> 01:11:59.784
I'll cover you in my reports
as long as I can.

01:12:02.127 --> 01:12:06.063
- What about you?
- I stay.

01:12:07.967 --> 01:12:10.561
This is where the war is.

01:12:12.872 --> 01:12:15.898
- That's heavy duty.
- That's what we are.

01:12:18.978 --> 01:12:21.310
I'm with you.

01:12:24.083 --> 01:12:26.984
- Whatever.
- What do we do first?

01:12:35.527 --> 01:12:36.858
Learn.

01:12:36.929 --> 01:12:41.059
Wind is from the right, allow three
feet for wind plus one foot for drift.

01:12:41.133 --> 01:12:43.067
That's four feet.
Wind from the left...

01:12:43.135 --> 01:12:45.899
allow three feet for wind,
subtract one foot for drift.

01:12:45.971 --> 01:12:48.599
That's two feet. Clear?

01:12:56.115 --> 01:12:58.276
You're spraying fire
all over the place.

01:12:58.350 --> 01:13:01.717
You're waiting ammo.
You have a zone to cover. Cover it!

01:13:07.526 --> 01:13:11.053
You're a perfect target.
Zigzag. Use your body.

01:13:11.130 --> 01:13:14.361
Bob and weave.
Get over the wall. Get to cover!

01:13:20.439 --> 01:13:23.431
So what's the big deal? L...

01:13:24.843 --> 01:13:28.335
Each guy's life depends on all...

01:13:28.414 --> 01:13:31.008
on each man doing his job.

01:13:31.083 --> 01:13:33.381
You cover your zone.

01:13:33.452 --> 01:13:35.784
You know the man on your right
has got your right covered.

01:13:35.854 --> 01:13:39.813
You know the man on your left
will kill everything on your left.

01:13:40.693 --> 01:13:43.184
You're all part of each other.

01:13:43.262 --> 01:13:45.196
Fingers on a hand.

01:13:47.833 --> 01:13:49.767
A fire team!

01:13:51.270 --> 01:13:54.364
Let's retake the house... again.

01:13:57.109 --> 01:13:59.407
I hear you got problems
with some street gang...

01:13:59.478 --> 01:14:03.505
and some strong-arm Indian moving in,
put you in the hospital?

01:14:03.582 --> 01:14:07.279
No, Mr. Quintana, you see,
I'm on top of the situation.

01:14:07.353 --> 01:14:11.346
It's nothing but a bunch of punk kids
living across the street from the park.

01:14:11.423 --> 01:14:13.357
So me and my people,
we go and we torch the place.

01:14:13.425 --> 01:14:15.893
We dust them off. You don't have
to worry about your product...

01:14:15.961 --> 01:14:18.429
'cause your sales be back
to where they was in no time at all.

01:14:18.497 --> 01:14:22.524
- I guarantee it.
- Don't need you, man.

01:14:22.601 --> 01:14:24.626
Your action is worth
steady, serious money.

01:14:27.106 --> 01:14:29.734
If you can't handle it,
I've got people who can.

01:14:32.978 --> 01:14:36.641
Nikki, cover yourself
when there's niggers around.

01:14:39.985 --> 01:14:43.045
You take care of business
or get out of business.

01:14:47.226 --> 01:14:48.716
Clean up the mess.

01:14:56.268 --> 01:14:57.701
Come in.

01:15:08.247 --> 01:15:09.578
Pretty sharp.

01:15:11.617 --> 01:15:13.482
I'm leaving.

01:15:15.287 --> 01:15:18.814
- Not comin' back this time.
- You asking me or telling me?

01:15:18.891 --> 01:15:20.324
I got another war.

01:15:23.495 --> 01:15:24.928
Same war.

01:15:26.832 --> 01:15:29.266
You're just changing sides.

01:15:30.636 --> 01:15:33.605
- Hey, I want what's mine.
- Drug business?

01:15:33.672 --> 01:15:37.574
The life. Makes you feel
like you're somebody.

01:15:37.643 --> 01:15:40.043
You think you'll get your girl
back that way?

01:15:41.480 --> 01:15:45.280
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Yes, you do.

01:16:11.643 --> 01:16:14.578
Carlos, I've been
looking all over for you.

01:16:27.559 --> 01:16:30.323
Wait a minute.
I'm leavin'.

01:17:11.103 --> 01:17:14.095
I've got $10,000 cash.

01:17:16.408 --> 01:17:18.569
We can go away together.

01:17:18.644 --> 01:17:20.168
Far away.

01:17:27.586 --> 01:17:32.250
You think I want your money,
you stupid bitch?

01:17:32.324 --> 01:17:34.656
Go back to Nestor.

01:17:38.764 --> 01:17:40.425
And fuck you too!

01:17:41.466 --> 01:17:43.457
- Let go of me!
- How much did he pay? You <i>puta!</i>

01:19:08.153 --> 01:19:10.212
Jesus Christ!

01:19:22.534 --> 01:19:24.058
Please calm down!

01:19:24.136 --> 01:19:27.503
Hurry up. All right, this is it.
You stay cool and you stay low.

01:19:31.843 --> 01:19:35.574
- What the hell's going on?
- I don't know. I can't see.

01:19:44.690 --> 01:19:46.681
I've never been anywhere
but Miami.

01:19:46.758 --> 01:19:49.921
Well, Cuba, but I was a kid.

01:19:49.995 --> 01:19:52.725
- I can hardly remember.
- It's gonna be great.

01:19:53.665 --> 01:19:55.895
I mean, we have enough money.
We can go anywhere we want.

01:19:55.967 --> 01:20:00.131
Yeah, Nestor. That <i>cabron.</i>
I should kill him.

01:20:00.205 --> 01:20:02.139
I'll never go back
to Miami.

01:20:03.075 --> 01:20:07.375
Today on the boat he put a knife
through some guy's hand...

01:20:08.513 --> 01:20:10.572
because he was
looking at me, he said.

01:20:11.717 --> 01:20:15.118
But it was because of business.

01:20:15.187 --> 01:20:18.384
Nestor was on the guy's boss,
some huge black dude...

01:20:18.457 --> 01:20:20.391
because of some street kids
and an Indian...

01:20:20.459 --> 01:20:23.895
- causing trouble and cutting into sales.
- What was that?

01:20:23.962 --> 01:20:27.329
Some house on a park near Little Havana.
They're gonna hit it tonight.

01:20:33.038 --> 01:20:34.733
What are you doing?

01:21:08.173 --> 01:21:10.539
- Where's Joe?
- He's out there.

01:21:17.048 --> 01:21:19.016
Let's go.

01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:03.751
Get out! Come on!

01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:23.914
Fuck this! Come on!

01:22:31.857 --> 01:22:34.052
How is he? Carlos!

01:22:43.268 --> 01:22:44.599
Come on, man.

01:22:47.672 --> 01:22:50.368
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm all right.

01:22:50.442 --> 01:22:52.569
My God.
Look at the house.

01:23:06.958 --> 01:23:09.825
Where's Dorcey?

01:23:13.465 --> 01:23:14.557
I'm okay!

01:23:45.330 --> 01:23:46.456
He's not...

01:23:51.169 --> 01:23:52.932
Get the jeep.

01:23:54.940 --> 01:23:56.532
Get the jeep!

01:24:00.111 --> 01:24:02.204
Get the guns.

01:25:13.385 --> 01:25:14.716
<i>So what now?</i>

01:25:15.954 --> 01:25:19.355
Back to the slam.
Police get their hands on me.

01:25:20.859 --> 01:25:22.451
Never. Not me.

01:25:25.463 --> 01:25:27.397
We're on our own now.

01:25:29.334 --> 01:25:31.268
Adios, amigos.

01:27:15.039 --> 01:27:18.736
"Five... man...

01:27:22.514 --> 01:27:24.038
marine...

01:27:36.094 --> 01:27:37.584
unit...

01:27:38.997 --> 01:27:42.990
decorated..."

01:27:46.538 --> 01:27:48.472
- What's this word?
- "Posthumously."

01:27:48.540 --> 01:27:50.531
It means after you're dead.

01:27:59.951 --> 01:28:04.411
"Sole survivor of fire team
awarded Medal of Honor."

01:28:26.344 --> 01:28:28.778
"Band of the Hand."

01:28:31.382 --> 01:28:34.818
Joe said we're all
part of each other.

01:28:34.886 --> 01:28:36.911
The fingers of a hand.

01:28:43.027 --> 01:28:44.585
His signs.

01:28:46.364 --> 01:28:48.127
Brujeria.

01:28:52.303 --> 01:28:54.737
Black magic.

01:28:57.175 --> 01:28:59.473
Nestor the guy
you worked for?

01:29:02.013 --> 01:29:05.005
Cream was Nestor's trigger.

01:29:05.083 --> 01:29:07.017
Nestor killed Joe.

01:29:23.368 --> 01:29:24.960
Nestor's the man.

01:29:29.407 --> 01:29:31.534
Let's take the man down.

01:29:52.764 --> 01:29:54.698
Is everything set
with the Colombian?

01:29:54.766 --> 01:29:56.893
Yeah, yeah, don't worry.

01:29:56.968 --> 01:30:00.233
In two weeks, I'm setting up the biggest
processing plant in North Miami.

01:30:00.305 --> 01:30:02.296
Don't give me this
"Don't worry" crap.

01:30:04.575 --> 01:30:06.372
So who's the courier
for my money?

01:30:06.444 --> 01:30:09.675
Flamingo Torres.
Payoff's in Nassau.

01:30:09.747 --> 01:30:13.706
I want him tailed until I fucking hear
the deposits are in.

01:30:13.785 --> 01:30:17.482
- You got it?
- Yeah.

01:30:17.555 --> 01:30:19.523
All right.

01:30:19.590 --> 01:30:22.684
What about the kids?
You wanna do anything?

01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:26.719
When you get around to it,
you take Nikki.

01:30:27.498 --> 01:30:31.935
You do to her whatever you want,
then kill her.

01:30:32.003 --> 01:30:33.493
Kids.

01:30:33.571 --> 01:30:36.802
Nothin'. Nobody.

01:31:01.466 --> 01:31:03.957
- Maybe he's sick.
- Go to a big hospital, no clinic.

01:31:04.035 --> 01:31:06.367
Stays two minutes each time.

01:31:11.309 --> 01:31:12.640
Ether.

01:31:18.149 --> 01:31:19.411
Truck's moving.

01:32:18.509 --> 01:32:20.807
Coffee beans, my ass.

01:32:27.919 --> 01:32:31.616
$117.35.

01:32:31.689 --> 01:32:34.055
Yo, mama, pay the man.

01:32:41.933 --> 01:32:45.801
So what do you guys
need this stuff for anyway?

01:32:49.707 --> 01:32:53.165
We're gonna plant a garden
and fertilize it with the nitrogen...

01:32:53.244 --> 01:32:56.236
and if there's gophers,
we're going to get them with a trap.

01:32:56.314 --> 01:32:58.407
If that doesn't work,
we're gonna use the gopher gas.

01:32:58.483 --> 01:33:02.317
And if that doesn't work, we're gonna
cement it all in and paint it green.

01:33:13.064 --> 01:33:14.998
There's no gophers
in this area.

01:33:17.068 --> 01:33:20.560
Who do you think
you're talkin' to?

01:33:23.407 --> 01:33:27.434
Armadillos. Those are the meanest
suckers you're ever gonna want to see.

01:33:27.512 --> 01:33:29.503
I'll tell you how you
take care of'em.

01:33:29.580 --> 01:33:33.175
Pour a little painting fluid out there
and make 'em drink it, okay?

01:33:33.251 --> 01:33:35.776
That cuts off the oxygen
to their brain.

01:33:35.853 --> 01:33:38.378
What you wanna do then is zap 'em
with a little fluorescent paint...

01:33:38.456 --> 01:33:40.390
so you can see 'em
in the dark.

01:33:40.458 --> 01:33:45.122
Then you can get behind 'em
with some reinforced tungsten steel...

01:33:45.196 --> 01:33:47.596
you can get it around 'em
and... Johhny Ola.

01:33:47.665 --> 01:33:51.567
Just cut their motor.
But you gotta kill 'em the first time.

01:33:51.636 --> 01:33:53.831
'Cause if you don't, they get
this revenge thing in their mind...

01:33:53.905 --> 01:33:55.839
and they come back
lookin' for you.

01:33:55.907 --> 01:33:58.239
I grew up in Pecos.
You know where that is, in Texas?

01:33:59.277 --> 01:34:02.110
Well, down there, the armadillos
grow to about nine feet tall.

01:34:02.180 --> 01:34:05.946
They take babies away and...
Things are dangerous.

01:35:10.881 --> 01:35:13.441
LikeJoe said, it's zones.

01:35:13.517 --> 01:35:16.111
So I'll be on top, covering
the roof and front. Go.

01:35:16.187 --> 01:35:18.314
I do my thing,
then fall back. Then?

01:35:18.389 --> 01:35:21.825
I get to the left corner of the house so
I can cover the left flank. Meanwhile...

01:35:21.892 --> 01:35:24.520
I cover the rights side of the house
from the right porch corner so...

01:35:24.595 --> 01:35:26.460
So I can make it
to the front door.

01:35:26.530 --> 01:35:29.522
If we don't make it
to that front porch, we're dead.

01:35:30.701 --> 01:35:34.262
- How far we gotta be when it goes off?
- All the way back to the wire.

01:35:34.338 --> 01:35:37.671
<i>Oye, mano,</i> it's a snap.
If everything goes A-okay...

01:35:37.742 --> 01:35:42.179
we got maybe a one in a five chance
of pulling this thing off.

01:35:45.283 --> 01:35:49.481
- The Colombian is here.
- All right. It's now. We're on.

01:35:51.255 --> 01:35:53.189
Come on, we gotta go
with what we got.

01:35:53.257 --> 01:35:56.385
- I need more time.
- We ain't got it. It's now or never.

01:37:11.969 --> 01:37:14.938
Come on, bitch.
Let the big boys know you're here.

01:37:17.575 --> 01:37:19.509
- What are we gonna do?
- Keep cutting.

01:37:22.546 --> 01:37:25.947
You sure she's in heat?

01:37:26.016 --> 01:37:27.950
Here they come.

01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:39.857
Sure glad those dogs are horny.

01:37:41.899 --> 01:37:45.266
- They're probably after a squirrel.
- Yeah, I guess you're right.

01:38:40.825 --> 01:38:42.952
It's nice, huh?

01:38:43.027 --> 01:38:45.587
Air conditioning
sucks the ether out.

01:38:45.663 --> 01:38:48.461
Filters it clean.
No smell outside.

01:38:48.532 --> 01:38:51.729
There's nothing like this
anywhere in the States.

01:39:21.098 --> 01:39:23.362
The switch!
The air conditioner! Turn it off!

01:39:49.193 --> 01:39:52.219
- Get him!
- Tommy, come here!

01:40:01.405 --> 01:40:04.465
Who the fuck is out there?

01:40:19.356 --> 01:40:21.085
On the roof!

01:40:22.927 --> 01:40:26.419
- Holy shit!
- I got 'em! I got 'em!

01:40:38.776 --> 01:40:40.801
- Motherfucker's over there!
- Let's do it!

01:42:10.501 --> 01:42:12.731
Behind you!

01:42:17.007 --> 01:42:18.497
Get behind there!

01:42:28.519 --> 01:42:31.386
Come on, come on, come on!

01:42:40.831 --> 01:42:43.959
- Come on, let's go! Move it!
- Come on, let's go!

01:42:57.981 --> 01:43:01.075
Yo, come on, man!
Come on!

01:43:36.086 --> 01:43:38.020
Give me the gun, Nikki.

01:44:04.248 --> 01:44:08.844
Come on,J.L., blow it!
Come on! Come on, blow it!

01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:51.653
Joe should've been here.

01:44:56.733 --> 01:45:00.260
We did what he wanted,
didn't we?

01:45:03.974 --> 01:45:05.908
There's nothing we can't do.

01:45:43.413 --> 01:45:45.677
Hi, Officer.
What happened back there?

01:45:45.749 --> 01:45:47.910
Yeah. We could see that fire
back in Homestead.

01:45:48.652 --> 01:45:52.019
I don't know, kids. You know
as much as I do. Where you headed?

01:45:52.089 --> 01:45:53.215
Miami.

01:45:53.290 --> 01:45:55.781
- We gotta jam!
- Yeah!

01:45:58.829 --> 01:46:00.854
Easy on the beer, huh?
Drive safe.

01:46:00.931 --> 01:46:03.900
- Thank you.
- Thanks, Officer!

01:46:03.967 --> 01:46:06.162
- See ya later!
- Have a good night, Officer!
