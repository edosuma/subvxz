WEBVTT

00:05.005 --> 00:06.756
[Lydia humming]

00:09.051 --> 00:11.803
Abuelita,  how are you
so happy in the morning?

00:11.886 --> 00:13.596
Oh, it's easy,  Mamita.

00:13.680 --> 00:16.183
Every night I dream of your  abuelo,

00:16.266 --> 00:19.227
and we are playing dominoes
and I win. [chuckles]

00:20.853 --> 00:24.066
-Over and over and--
-Okay, I got it!

00:25.983 --> 00:26.984
[knocking on door]

00:29.071 --> 00:30.988
Hey, guys, you're in luck.

00:31.073 --> 00:34.701
I finally found a vintage store that had
a chair that matches your dining set.

00:34.784 --> 00:36.161
Why do we need an extra chair?

00:36.244 --> 00:37.912
It's not really extra. There's five of us.

00:38.871 --> 00:39.872
[all gasp]

00:39.956 --> 00:42.125
I know. It's not a perfect match.

00:42.209 --> 00:44.377
But it's hardly the sorest thumb
in the room.

00:45.503 --> 00:47.630
Not the chair!
What the hell are you wearing?

00:48.214 --> 00:50.216
Oh. Che Guevara? Yeah.

00:50.300 --> 00:52.635
Viva la revolución,  am I right?

00:53.178 --> 00:54.762
You are wrong.

00:55.638 --> 00:58.433
-Do you have any idea--
-I got this.

00:58.516 --> 01:00.060
Do you have any idea--

01:00.143 --> 01:01.353
Kids, relax.

01:01.436 --> 01:04.481
[yells] Do you have any idea
what this  comemierda  did?

01:04.564 --> 01:06.900
Grew an awesome beard
and modeled for T-shirts?

01:11.446 --> 01:13.656
First of all, he wasn't even Cuban!

01:13.740 --> 01:16.243
He was Castro's right-hand man.

01:16.326 --> 01:20.455
He burned books. He banned music.
He personally oversaw execution squads.

01:20.538 --> 01:21.998
He was a mass murderer!

01:22.582 --> 01:24.084
But... [sighs]

01:24.167 --> 01:25.752
He has a cool hat.

01:26.961 --> 01:29.964
It's like if you walked into a Jewish home
wearing a Hitler shirt.

01:31.258 --> 01:33.385
Or into Taylor Swift's home
wearing a Kanye shirt.

01:33.468 --> 01:35.970
Oh, my God! You guys. I am so sorry.

01:36.053 --> 01:38.765
-I had no idea. [pants]
-Okay.

01:38.848 --> 01:40.267
We forgive you, Schneider.

01:40.350 --> 01:43.853
We know that sometimes you are a  bobo
and don't know what you're doing.

01:44.354 --> 01:45.355
It's okay.

01:56.408 --> 01:57.909
Okay, now I kind of miss the shirt.

01:58.743 --> 02:00.078
[theme song playing]

02:49.502 --> 02:50.795
Hey, everybody.

02:50.879 --> 02:53.089
Oh, finally you're home.
I have great news.

02:53.172 --> 02:55.467
That reminds me!  Papito  has great news!

02:58.011 --> 03:00.889
I do.
In school, we have our nation project

03:00.972 --> 03:02.515
and today we picked our countries.

03:02.599 --> 03:04.726
We chose alphabetically by last name.

03:04.809 --> 03:07.144
Finally, makes me proud to be an Alvarez.

03:07.229 --> 03:10.064
So, not the brave military mom
wounded in the line of duty?

03:10.147 --> 03:11.148
Okay.

03:12.859 --> 03:15.445
Let me guess. You went for the easy A
and picked America?

03:15.528 --> 03:19.073
No. Stupid Travis Aarons got America.

03:20.867 --> 03:21.993
I chose Cuba.

03:22.076 --> 03:25.288
No,  papito.  Cuba chose you.

03:26.331 --> 03:29.292
It'll be nice for you to do some research
on where we're from.

03:29.376 --> 03:33.296
Yeah, I'm probably just going to film
abuelita  blabbing for a while.

03:33.380 --> 03:37.925
You know her, "Cuba, Cuba, Cuba.
Ay. ¡Azúcar!"

03:39.051 --> 03:41.429
You have captured my essence.

03:43.014 --> 03:44.557
I won't even have to write a paper.

03:44.641 --> 03:46.142
It's like no work.

03:46.226 --> 03:49.145
[sighs] Be less excited about that part.
Put some effort in.

03:49.729 --> 03:51.272
Hey, why are you so hard on him?

03:51.356 --> 03:52.774
[chuckles] Are you kidding me?

03:52.857 --> 03:56.278
What happened to,
"An A is an A, but a B is an F,

03:56.361 --> 04:00.198
and a C stands for China, because that's
where you're going to live now."

04:01.908 --> 04:03.326
Okay, that's true.

04:03.410 --> 04:06.246
But  papito  has such a pretty face
to fall back on.

04:08.205 --> 04:10.833
Worst-case scenario,
I'll just marry some rich lady.

04:11.918 --> 04:12.960
That's my boy.

04:16.172 --> 04:17.757
[yells] Remember me?

04:19.634 --> 04:21.678
Can I finally share my news?

04:21.761 --> 04:23.179
I'm sorry, mama.

04:24.347 --> 04:25.765
Please tell us.

04:26.349 --> 04:30.728
Sister Fidelis told me that I'm a finalist
for the Voices of Tomorrow.

04:30.812 --> 04:31.813
[Penelope and Lydia gasping]

04:31.896 --> 04:34.899
The singing show? [gasping]

04:34.983 --> 04:38.319
Nietecita,  I could not be more proud.

04:39.404 --> 04:40.613
It's a writing program.

04:41.197 --> 04:42.115
Oh.

04:45.368 --> 04:47.203
Kookie, that's great.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.871
It's a really big deal.

04:48.955 --> 04:51.499
Only 30 students get chosen
out of the whole country.

04:51.583 --> 04:53.084
[whooping] But wait--

04:53.167 --> 04:54.251
How much does it cost?

04:54.336 --> 04:55.545
All expenses paid.

04:55.628 --> 04:57.254
[whooping] That's what I'm talking about!

04:59.131 --> 05:01.801
I mean, they say it's an Ivy League
stepping stone.

05:01.884 --> 05:04.178
Not that I buy into the aristocracy
of the Ivy League,

05:04.261 --> 05:07.056
but it will be rewarding
to turn Harvard down.

05:08.015 --> 05:09.642
You get into Harvard, you're going.

05:10.435 --> 05:13.104
Columbia even better, 'cause it will be
easy for  Abuelita  to pronounce.

05:13.187 --> 05:14.856
[mouthing] Columbia.

05:16.232 --> 05:18.150
So, if they pick you...

05:18.985 --> 05:20.945
what do we get to put
in the Alvarez Museum?

05:21.028 --> 05:23.990
Come on! A trophy? A medal? A ribbon?

05:24.073 --> 05:25.825
And don't say
the value of a job well done.

05:25.908 --> 05:27.035
We need hardware!

05:27.535 --> 05:30.455
-I don't think I get anything.
-There's got to be something.

05:30.538 --> 05:32.957
I need a visual record of how hard
you guys are killing it.

05:33.040 --> 05:34.626
Because that means you're killing it.

05:34.709 --> 05:36.210
Because that means I'm killing it!

05:37.337 --> 05:38.963
-But I'm not even in yet.
-[shushing]

05:40.965 --> 05:42.592
We're going to have to make some space.

05:43.510 --> 05:46.345
Can we take down the shadow box
with our baby teeth in it?

05:49.432 --> 05:50.642
Why would we do that?

05:52.394 --> 05:54.562
Abuelita  has a whole necklace planned.

05:56.731 --> 05:58.566
Who would ever wear that necklace?

05:58.650 --> 06:01.110
Your bride, at your wedding.

06:02.278 --> 06:03.279
[both gagging]

06:06.408 --> 06:07.867
I love that they think we're serious.

06:07.950 --> 06:08.951
[both giggling]

06:12.204 --> 06:13.915
You're in a good mood.

06:13.998 --> 06:15.583
-Is it because you--
-Stop!

06:15.667 --> 06:17.710
Think. Is it appropriate?

06:19.504 --> 06:20.380
Never mind.

06:22.799 --> 06:24.133
But I am in a good mood

06:24.217 --> 06:27.095
because Elena is up
for a very competitive writing program.

06:27.178 --> 06:28.012
It's pretty huge.

06:28.095 --> 06:30.682
-She wants to be a journalist.
-Like on  E! News?

06:30.765 --> 06:33.100
-No, like someone who writes the news.
-So like  Us Weekly.

06:34.393 --> 06:35.394
At least you're reading.

06:37.271 --> 06:38.314
But I'm proud of her.

06:38.397 --> 06:40.567
She has a dream
and she's making it happen.

06:40.650 --> 06:42.860
I remember when I had dreams.

06:43.444 --> 06:45.071
When I was her age,

06:45.154 --> 06:48.533
I wanted to be the next Allan Sherman!

06:51.368 --> 06:53.412
The famous song parodist?

06:54.163 --> 06:55.790
"Hello Mudduh, Hello Fadduh"?

06:57.124 --> 06:58.585
"Shticks and Stones"?

06:58.668 --> 07:02.088
And, instead of "Hava Nagila,"
"Harvey and Sheila."

07:03.422 --> 07:06.133
I used to dream of competing
in the X Games.

07:06.717 --> 07:08.719
I had my own street luge.

07:08.803 --> 07:11.764
You probably can't tell this by looking
at me, but I was a big luger!

07:14.058 --> 07:15.059
Oh, we can tell.

07:16.644 --> 07:20.440
A singer, a street luger
and a person who could read.

07:22.609 --> 07:25.820
What was your crazy,
unrealistic dream, Penelope?

07:28.865 --> 07:30.032
I wanted to be a doctor.

07:31.325 --> 07:32.869
Well, that's not a crazy dream.

07:32.952 --> 07:35.622
It's just a regular, attainable dream
that you didn't attain.

07:38.416 --> 07:39.292
Oh.

07:39.375 --> 07:42.754
[chuckles] No, it's fine.
Life went a different way.

07:42.837 --> 07:44.672
Army, marriage, kids...

07:44.756 --> 07:47.634
I guess 18-year-old me
would be disappointed in my career,

07:47.717 --> 07:50.136
but she also wore brown eyeliner
on her lips,

07:50.219 --> 07:51.345
so what'd that fool know?

07:51.428 --> 07:52.930
[laughing]

07:53.014 --> 07:54.098
So...

07:54.182 --> 07:55.308
Yeah, I mean, I...

07:55.975 --> 07:57.644
I've made sacrifices, but...

07:57.727 --> 08:00.647
that just means Alex and Elena
can have an even better life than I did.

08:00.730 --> 08:02.273
Just like my parents did for me.

08:04.150 --> 08:06.777
I know that's supposed to sound sweet,
but it really bums me out.

08:09.405 --> 08:12.658
So I had to flee Cuba
and come here to America.

08:13.659 --> 08:17.121
Your  abuelo  and I were separated for years

08:17.204 --> 08:20.875
before we found our way back
into each other's arms. [gasps]

08:20.958 --> 08:24.921
There was an earthquake
the day we were reunited

08:25.004 --> 08:31.260
and I am convinced that the passion
of our embrace moved the Earth.

08:34.514 --> 08:35.557
[sighs]

08:35.640 --> 08:38.475
Not sure the science checks out,
but who cares?

08:39.351 --> 08:40.352
That was beautiful.

08:40.436 --> 08:42.647
[chuckles] Oh.  Gracias.

08:42.730 --> 08:44.398
What are you doing?

08:45.274 --> 08:48.861
History is coming alive before your eyes!

08:49.862 --> 08:52.448
And that's too small a camera
for too big a star!

08:52.532 --> 08:54.826
-What?
-Keep talking.

08:57.036 --> 08:59.038
You are so lucky she's here.

08:59.121 --> 09:02.542
I know nothing about my grandparents
and I never will.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.126
And they live in Pasadena!

09:07.714 --> 09:09.465
I mean, the traffic's just...

09:10.466 --> 09:11.467
[sighs]

09:12.885 --> 09:16.347
Anyway,
this is a huge opportunity for you.

09:16.430 --> 09:17.599
With the right production value,

09:17.682 --> 09:20.226
this might qualify
for a Student Academy Award.

09:20.309 --> 09:22.353
-[gasps]
-Oh, yeah. The Soscars?

09:22.436 --> 09:23.646
It's a thing.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.190
I could win a trophy?

09:26.273 --> 09:28.901
Something for the Alvarez Museum
besides my teeth?

09:28.985 --> 09:31.362
Don't forget your umbilical cord.
[chuckles]

09:32.029 --> 09:33.906
What the hell kind of museum is this?

09:35.157 --> 09:36.408
I'm gonna make a movie!

09:36.492 --> 09:39.746
I'll write a script, cast it, edit it...

09:40.037 --> 09:42.832
Wait, am I making more work for myself?

09:43.916 --> 09:45.668
Am I excited about it?

09:47.336 --> 09:50.047
Is this what it's like to be Elena?

09:52.091 --> 09:54.969
I will start my beauty regime now.

09:55.052 --> 09:56.763
I will be ready at dawn.

09:56.846 --> 10:00.057
-Okay, but I have to go to school.
-Oh, good. 'Cause dawn was pushing it.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.728
Okay.
So we're doing this tomorrow afternoon?

10:03.811 --> 10:06.230
Ah, I was supposed to have jury duty,
but you know what?

10:06.313 --> 10:08.608
I'm just gonna call my guy.
This is more important.

10:11.819 --> 10:12.987
Oh, hey, Pen.

10:13.070 --> 10:15.197
Do you have a 50-foot extension cord
and some dry ice?

10:15.281 --> 10:16.991
You know what?
I'll make a run to the depot.

10:17.074 --> 10:19.327
There's this great one
I like to hit in Pasadena.

10:22.538 --> 10:25.291
-Do I wanna know?
-Tomorrow, I'm filming the whole family

10:25.374 --> 10:26.584
for my Cuba project.

10:26.667 --> 10:29.128
It's a lot of extra work,
but I'm really excited.

10:30.129 --> 10:31.839
What is happening to me?

10:33.257 --> 10:36.844
Elena, something came in the mail!

10:36.928 --> 10:39.180
-[shrieking]
-Ow!

10:40.139 --> 10:41.557
[Penelope] Look, here!

10:44.226 --> 10:46.646
-Is it from the Voices of Tomorrow?
-Yes, it is!

10:46.729 --> 10:48.648
Looks like someone's gonna be
the next Danielle Steel!

10:48.731 --> 10:50.983
-[Lydia chuckles]
-What? She's a writer.

10:53.861 --> 10:56.530
-"Dear, Ms. Alvarez...
-[both shrieking]

10:56.613 --> 11:01.202
Every year, thousands of students apply
nationwide to fill 30 prestigious spots.

11:01.285 --> 11:02.870
We are pleased to inform you...

11:02.954 --> 11:03.996
[both shrieking]

11:04.080 --> 11:06.415
of your acceptance
to the Voices of Tomorrow."

11:07.458 --> 11:09.752
I did it! Screw you, Harvard!

11:09.835 --> 11:11.754
No, no.
She didn't mean that, Harvard!

11:12.338 --> 11:16.300
"It is our pleasure to inform you that
you are this year's diversity candidate."

11:16.801 --> 11:18.094
Diversity candidate?

11:20.262 --> 11:22.598
Diversity candidate!

11:23.975 --> 11:27.644
"Being a diverse person..."
That's not even grammatically correct.

11:28.479 --> 11:29.939
"you have a unique perspective

11:30.022 --> 11:33.234
and we value your contribution
to our conversation."

11:33.735 --> 11:35.987
-Ugh!
-What? That all sounds great.

11:36.070 --> 11:37.864
No, they're saying I only got in
'cause I'm Cuban.

11:38.948 --> 11:40.658
An award for being Cuban?

11:41.158 --> 11:43.077
Finally!

11:46.288 --> 11:48.665
You should take opportunities
when they come.

11:48.749 --> 11:49.792
'Cause when you're my age,

11:49.875 --> 11:51.752
you might regret
having missed your chance.

11:51.836 --> 11:54.713
I want a spot, not a diversity spot.

11:55.589 --> 11:59.260
What happened to, "Diversity programs
are part of our national responsibility,

11:59.343 --> 12:02.096
to level out a systemically
uneven playing field"?

12:02.179 --> 12:04.849
-Well said.
-You said that... when you were eight.

12:06.809 --> 12:09.812
I'm sorry. It just feels weird!
It's, like, tainted.

12:10.479 --> 12:11.647
I'll have to think about it.

12:12.606 --> 12:13.816
Where's the letter?

12:20.907 --> 12:21.908
Penelope...

12:22.909 --> 12:24.869
I need a consult, stat.

12:25.828 --> 12:27.663
-What's that?
-Lyrics.

12:29.874 --> 12:33.127
I was so inspired
by our conversation yesterday,

12:33.210 --> 12:35.546
I started writing parody songs.

12:36.923 --> 12:39.675
Doc, there's, like, 20 patients
waiting outside.

12:39.758 --> 12:40.927
[mumbles]

12:41.010 --> 12:42.804
Just tell me which one you like better.

12:42.887 --> 12:45.222
[snapping fingers
and tapping foot rhythmically]

12:45.306 --> 12:47.433
♪ What a ham, what a ham, what a ham ♪

12:47.516 --> 12:50.227
♪ What a mighty honey glazed ham ♪

12:54.398 --> 12:55.399
Or...

12:57.401 --> 12:58.903
♪ Exercising makes us strong ♪

12:58.986 --> 13:00.779
♪ Zumba, Zumba ♪

13:05.493 --> 13:08.579
Wow, this... It's just so hard to pick.

13:09.080 --> 13:11.540
-I have others--
-No. Okay, the ham. I like the ham one.

13:11.623 --> 13:13.375
Don't do the Zumba.
Please don't do that again.

13:15.836 --> 13:20.424
I-- I am really enjoying myself,
you know?

13:20.883 --> 13:22.551
It's never too late to do what you love.

13:24.261 --> 13:26.805
Okay. So, I've been thinking.

13:27.849 --> 13:30.559
Theoretically, if I still wanted
to become a doctor--

13:30.642 --> 13:32.686
Yes, yes, yes!

13:32.769 --> 13:34.730
Okay! [chuckles] Now I'm excited!

13:34.813 --> 13:36.732
Break it down.
[stutters] Tell me, what do I do?

13:36.815 --> 13:38.609
First, you take the MCAT.

13:39.443 --> 13:41.320
Then you take it again when you fail.

13:42.113 --> 13:44.281
Most people do. Me, three times.

13:44.365 --> 13:45.532
[chuckles]

13:45.616 --> 13:48.119
And then, just four years of med school.

13:48.202 --> 13:49.871
Okay. Five years, that's not bad!

13:49.954 --> 13:51.914
Then three years of residency.

13:51.998 --> 13:54.083
And you never know
where they're gonna send you,

13:54.166 --> 13:55.751
or what adventure awaits you.

13:55.834 --> 13:58.212
You may get Honolulu. I got Toledo.

13:59.546 --> 14:02.424
Why people say, "Holy Toledo,"
I'll never know.

14:02.508 --> 14:05.052
Nothing holy about it. It's hell.

14:05.136 --> 14:06.178
[laughs]

14:06.262 --> 14:08.639
Okay. [chuckles] Eight years.

14:08.722 --> 14:10.766
Oh, and then your fellowship.
Three more years.

14:11.350 --> 14:12.518
So, 11 years?

14:12.601 --> 14:13.852
Wow.

14:13.936 --> 14:17.273
You are going to ace the math portion
of the MCAT.

14:18.357 --> 14:20.067
And don't you worry,

14:20.151 --> 14:23.529
you will be shocked
at how quickly a decade goes by.

14:23.612 --> 14:25.531
Especially when you don't see your family.

14:25.614 --> 14:27.741
But, in the end...

14:27.824 --> 14:30.744
it will all be worth it,
because you will be a doctor.

14:31.662 --> 14:34.290
And $200,000 in debt!

14:34.373 --> 14:35.582
[chuckles]

14:35.666 --> 14:38.377
-I still haven't paid mine off!
-You haven't?

14:38.460 --> 14:41.881
Looks like the sweet release of death
will come first.

14:41.964 --> 14:43.299
I win!

14:49.721 --> 14:50.847
Isn't this better?

14:50.931 --> 14:55.436
A good camera, proper lighting,
and a cast in wardrobe.

15:00.441 --> 15:02.026
I look like a fruit salad.

15:03.652 --> 15:05.029
I look like Cousin Consuelo.

15:08.199 --> 15:11.702
Don't let the beard throw you.
It actually looks really natural.

15:13.955 --> 15:17.041
Lights, camera... Talk now!

15:17.625 --> 15:19.418
[in exaggerated Cuban accent]
I am a farmer.

15:19.501 --> 15:22.296
I grow-- [grunts] coffee beans...

15:23.589 --> 15:26.258
one of Cuba's most important exports.

15:27.093 --> 15:30.721
I work every day from sunrise
to sunset.

15:31.305 --> 15:33.766
But I am happy with my simple life.

15:36.102 --> 15:37.144
Cut!

15:37.228 --> 15:38.395
Can we do it again?

15:38.479 --> 15:40.064
It doesn't really seem
like you're a farmer.

15:40.147 --> 15:42.399
[in normal voice]
'Cause I'm not really a farmer.

15:42.983 --> 15:44.735
It's not too late to recast.

15:46.278 --> 15:49.281
You auditioned and didn't get the part.
Move on, man.

15:53.244 --> 15:54.536
Okay, Elena, you're up.

15:55.162 --> 15:57.373
Great. But I have some notes
on the script.

15:57.456 --> 15:58.624
Oh, here we go.

15:59.291 --> 16:01.585
I hate it when the talent has thoughts.

16:04.671 --> 16:06.382
What are you trying to say about Cubans?

16:06.465 --> 16:08.425
You're making us out to be
total stereotypes.

16:08.509 --> 16:10.302
We're not this different
from everyone else.

16:10.386 --> 16:13.889
[scoffs softly]
Elena, get over the diversity thing.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.142
A committee of people think
you're a smart Latina,

16:16.225 --> 16:18.144
and they wanna help you
achieve your dreams.

16:18.227 --> 16:19.603
How is this not a good thing?

16:19.686 --> 16:22.689
Because I only got chosen
to fulfill their race quota!

16:22.773 --> 16:24.733
They probably think I dress like this,

16:24.816 --> 16:27.194
and that I came over
on a raft, rolling a cigar, and yelling,

16:27.277 --> 16:29.613
[imitating Tony Montana]
"Say hello to my little friend."

16:32.241 --> 16:33.826
-Can we please finish shooting?
-Yes.

16:33.909 --> 16:34.951
We'll talk about this later.

16:35.036 --> 16:36.328
There's nothing left to talk about.

16:36.412 --> 16:38.330
I already e-mailed them
and told them I'm not accepting it.

16:38.414 --> 16:39.415
You did what?

16:39.498 --> 16:40.499
What... [spits]

16:42.459 --> 16:43.710
You don't get it, kiddo.

16:43.794 --> 16:46.755
You don't get it! This is a big deal.

16:46.838 --> 16:50.009
And you don't have the luxury to be like,
"Oh, it hurts my feelings." Come on!

16:50.092 --> 16:52.178
When I was 15, I would've jumped at this.

16:52.261 --> 16:55.722
You have no idea what life
is going to throw at you,

16:55.806 --> 16:58.892
and right now, you have the chance
to pursue your dreams.

16:58.976 --> 17:00.602
And not everybody gets to do that.

17:00.686 --> 17:02.229
But it's my future!

17:02.313 --> 17:03.689
I wanna do it my way.

17:03.772 --> 17:04.940
Elena!

17:05.024 --> 17:07.568
Oh, how do you storm off in this thing?
[grunts]

17:10.612 --> 17:13.657
I have never seen such un-professionalism.

17:14.700 --> 17:15.909
This is why I don't work!

17:17.870 --> 17:20.372
It's okay. Let's get to the star.

17:20.456 --> 17:21.623
Abuelita,  you're up.

17:27.171 --> 17:28.589
Oh, hello.

17:30.091 --> 17:31.758
I didn't see you there.

17:31.842 --> 17:32.718
[chuckles]

17:34.303 --> 17:38.182
It is I, Lydia Riera,
the most famous dancer in Cuba.

17:38.765 --> 17:42.061
I can do flamenco, salsa, mambo,

17:42.144 --> 17:44.688
pachanga, and the Funky Chicken.

17:44.771 --> 17:46.148
[playing castanets]

17:52.488 --> 17:54.698
[vocalizing]

17:55.866 --> 17:58.952
Okay,  abuelita.
Time for your story.

17:59.036 --> 18:01.914
Make me laugh. Make me cry.

18:02.623 --> 18:03.707
Get me an A.

18:05.375 --> 18:07.586
Well, when I was in Cuba...

18:08.170 --> 18:13.675
the peoples would line up
for blocks and blocks just to see me.

18:13.759 --> 18:16.678
I was the iPhone of my time.

18:18.097 --> 18:22.226
But then Castro took over.
My family was forced to flee.

18:22.309 --> 18:24.144
And that's when I came to America.

18:24.645 --> 18:26.313
Ooh! You know what would be good?

18:26.397 --> 18:28.399
Talk about being
one of the Pedro Pan kids.

18:28.482 --> 18:29.983
[gasps] Ah!

18:30.066 --> 18:33.069
Pedro Pan was a program

18:33.154 --> 18:38.200
that started during the revolution
to fly children out of Cuba

18:38.284 --> 18:43.038
and give them safe haven
in the United States until Castro left.

18:43.122 --> 18:46.375
Okay... so you were put on a plane
to a new country

18:46.458 --> 18:47.793
where you didn't know the language?

18:48.377 --> 18:49.419
Oh, yes.

18:50.003 --> 18:50.879
Without your parents?

18:51.922 --> 18:53.090
Yes.

18:53.674 --> 18:57.428
And you were Elena's age,
which would have made  Tía  Maruchi my age?

18:58.720 --> 19:00.472
And Mimi would've been really young.

19:01.640 --> 19:02.516
Yes.

19:03.183 --> 19:05.269
Wow,  Abuelita.  I can't even imagine.

19:05.352 --> 19:08.314
That must have been so hard,
taking care of your sisters,

19:08.897 --> 19:10.274
since you were the oldest.

19:17.156 --> 19:17.990
Mami...

19:20.409 --> 19:21.493
Are you okay?

19:23.829 --> 19:24.830
Ah...

19:25.872 --> 19:29.543
[voice breaking] You know, I am sorry.
I'm a little tired.

19:31.337 --> 19:32.713
I'm sorry,  papito.

19:34.173 --> 19:37.301
I think I am done talking. Hmm?

19:48.520 --> 19:49.938
You want me to do her part?

20:13.629 --> 20:15.339
Is Alex okay?

20:15.422 --> 20:19.092
-Did I ruin his movie?
-No. Alex is fine.

20:20.260 --> 20:22.554
He's a little confused. Frankly, so am I.

20:23.054 --> 20:24.765
[sighing]

20:24.848 --> 20:27.809
I know how much you like talking
about all the good times in Cuba.

20:29.520 --> 20:31.230
And I also know
that there are certain things

20:31.313 --> 20:33.148
that are hard to talk about.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.276
But I've never seen you react like that.

20:37.403 --> 20:38.570
What's going on?

20:44.951 --> 20:47.078
It might be good for you to talk about it.

20:47.162 --> 20:48.497
That's what I've been doing in therapy.

20:49.248 --> 20:50.457
Okay, forget therapy.

20:54.544 --> 20:57.631
But you came here alone, with nothing...

20:58.674 --> 21:00.759
and you made an amazing life.

21:02.303 --> 21:04.388
Someday, maybe you could
talk to me about it.

21:06.973 --> 21:08.725
I would love to hear your whole story.

21:15.607 --> 21:17.943
I remember being at the airport.

21:22.614 --> 21:24.950
We were only allowed one suitcase.

21:26.493 --> 21:29.705
And my  mami  was so clever. [sniffles]

21:29.788 --> 21:32.291
She sewed two dresses together,

21:33.125 --> 21:34.501
one inside the other...

21:35.461 --> 21:37.253
so I could have more clothing.

21:40.215 --> 21:42.259
Then it was time to say goodbye...

21:43.677 --> 21:45.721
but I couldn't let go of Blanca.

21:48.307 --> 21:49.475
Who's Blanca?

21:50.684 --> 21:52.311
[sighs] My sister.

21:55.271 --> 21:56.898
Mami,  you don't have
a sister named Blanca.

21:56.982 --> 21:59.901
There's Mimi, Maruchi, Mirtha.

22:01.277 --> 22:02.988
She was my older sister.

22:05.073 --> 22:05.991
Oh.

22:06.492 --> 22:09.745
[sniffles] She couldn't come with us
because she was 19.

22:09.828 --> 22:12.247
Too old for Pedro Pan.

22:13.374 --> 22:15.792
And she kept telling me...

22:15.876 --> 22:19.463
"It's okay, we'll be seeing
each other again in a few months."

22:20.714 --> 22:21.715
She said...

22:22.299 --> 22:25.052
"Pucha,  you have to go.

22:25.969 --> 22:29.931
Walk through the  pecera
and don't look back.

22:30.932 --> 22:34.395
If you look back,
you will never go forward."

22:36.187 --> 22:37.188
So I did it.

22:38.524 --> 22:41.317
Because I did everything
Blanca told me to do.

22:43.070 --> 22:44.446
I never looked back.

22:44.946 --> 22:46.364
[softly]  Oy, Mami...  [sniffles]

22:47.699 --> 22:48.700
[sobbing]

22:50.201 --> 22:53.830
[sniffles] She died when you were little.

22:57.543 --> 23:00.629
They said that she died of the flu...

23:01.588 --> 23:02.589
Pero quién sabe.

23:05.050 --> 23:09.930
[sniffles] Every day,
I wish I hadn't listened to her.

23:10.472 --> 23:12.098
Every day...

23:14.059 --> 23:17.187
[sniffling and sobbing]
I wish I had looked back.

23:18.188 --> 23:19.773
Ay, Mami.

23:19.856 --> 23:21.399
Mami,  I'm so sorry.

23:22.568 --> 23:23.777
[both sobbing]

23:23.860 --> 23:25.946
No, no. It's okay.

23:26.822 --> 23:28.198
I'm glad I told you.

23:29.533 --> 23:32.828
Leaving was the hardest thing
I have ever had to do.

23:32.911 --> 23:35.872
And I am happy that I did it.

23:38.291 --> 23:39.793
Because look what I made.

23:42.378 --> 23:43.379
[Elena sniffles]

23:45.799 --> 23:46.800
[chuckles]

23:56.434 --> 23:58.061
So, I guess you heard everything?

23:58.144 --> 23:59.688
It's just a curtain!

24:06.778 --> 24:07.946
Abuelita...

24:09.447 --> 24:12.367
I had no idea
what our family's gone through.

24:13.451 --> 24:15.453
I'm gonna take that diversity spot.

24:15.537 --> 24:16.705
[sighs]

24:17.205 --> 24:18.874
I'm sorry I was so stubborn.

24:18.957 --> 24:20.375
It's okay.

24:21.710 --> 24:25.046
Just get in there and outshine everyone
and they won't even remember you're Cuban.

24:25.130 --> 24:26.006
Oh, no.

24:26.923 --> 24:30.051
I'm going to make sure
that they don't forget that I'm Cuban.

24:30.135 --> 24:32.137
Pa'lante!

24:34.472 --> 24:35.473
Abuelita...

24:36.600 --> 24:38.101
I'm sorry I made you upset.

24:38.184 --> 24:41.021
Oh, no, no. It's okay, honey.

24:41.104 --> 24:42.439
It's okay.

24:43.106 --> 24:44.816
I will tell it again.

24:44.900 --> 24:46.568
Oh, you don't have to do that.

24:47.402 --> 24:49.821
Just let me reapply my makeup.

24:49.905 --> 24:52.908
I didn't come all this way
for you to get a B.

24:56.036 --> 24:58.204
[Lydia on TV]
But every sacrifice was worth it,

24:58.288 --> 25:01.082
so that my family could be
whatever they wanted to be,

25:01.750 --> 25:04.711
and do whatever they wanted to do.

25:05.837 --> 25:08.048
[in exaggerated Cuban accent] Increíble!

25:09.591 --> 25:12.385
But that is only one story.

25:12.468 --> 25:17.849
There are many rich stories
from Cuba that must be told.

25:18.850 --> 25:20.018
Oh, no.

25:20.101 --> 25:21.102
The wind is picking up.

25:22.646 --> 25:25.691
Un huracán! [yelling] Un huracán!

25:29.945 --> 25:31.697
-[Dr. Berkowitz] Oh.
-[all applauding]

25:35.325 --> 25:37.828
Oh, Lydia,
I'm so thrilled to be your date

25:37.911 --> 25:41.414
at the premiere
of the greatest story ever filmed.

25:42.332 --> 25:44.835
You exaggerate, Leslie. [chuckles]

25:44.918 --> 25:45.919
Date.

25:47.671 --> 25:49.130
That was great, Alex.

25:49.214 --> 25:50.215
Thanks.

25:50.298 --> 25:53.594
And I finally have my contribution
to the Alvarez Museum.

25:53.677 --> 25:56.179
My script with an A-plus on the cover.

25:56.262 --> 25:57.764
[exclaiming and applauding]

25:58.682 --> 26:01.893
And don't forget your signed headshot
of the producer.

26:04.938 --> 26:06.273
That's not going on my wall.

26:06.982 --> 26:08.024
We'll see.

26:10.235 --> 26:13.571
Uh... but I may have something
to add to the wall soon.

26:14.948 --> 26:17.242
After giving it a lot of thought...

26:18.409 --> 26:20.954
I have decided to go back to school
to become--

26:21.037 --> 26:23.832
No, no, no! Don't become a doctor!

26:23.915 --> 26:26.918
Please, I've been regretting it
ever since we talked.

26:27.002 --> 26:29.337
I'm so sorry I inspired you.

26:31.131 --> 26:33.759
[chuckles] Relax, Doc.
You didn't inspire me.

26:35.051 --> 26:35.927
They did.

26:37.345 --> 26:40.306
I'm not gonna be a doctor.
I'm gonna be a nurse practitioner.

26:41.224 --> 26:43.894
It's all the things that excite me
about being a doctor,

26:43.977 --> 26:45.646
but the training
takes a fraction of the time,

26:45.729 --> 26:48.439
and it still comes
with a pretty sweet salary bump.

26:48.523 --> 26:51.067
-Wonderful. That's...
-Thank you.

26:51.151 --> 26:55.113
Hey, maybe we could both be
nurse practitioners.

26:56.865 --> 26:59.617
Nah, I couldn't.
I enjoy the white coat too much.

26:59.701 --> 27:00.702
[laughs]

27:01.286 --> 27:02.537
NPs get a white coat.

27:02.621 --> 27:04.414
Son of a bitch!

27:06.332 --> 27:08.209
Pobrecito  Leslie.

27:08.293 --> 27:10.295
Maybe this will cheer you up.
