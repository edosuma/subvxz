[snoring]

00:05.796 --> 00:09.266
[maniacal laughter]

00:09.301 --> 00:11.904
Could you stop?
That's really annoying.

00:13.441 --> 00:15.709
<i>You're</i> really annoying!

00:15.744 --> 00:18.446
I give you
one simple task.

00:18.481 --> 00:20.483
Simple?
What about this is simple?

00:20.518 --> 00:23.121
All you had to do is pose
as the pink one's friend,

00:23.156 --> 00:26.125
gain her trust, get invited
to a series of sleepovers,

00:26.160 --> 00:29.563
forge a Vesuvian diamond dagger
that can cut through anything,

00:29.598 --> 00:33.136
sneak into Scrooge's room
while he sleeps to enact
my grim revenge, and--

00:33.171 --> 00:35.506
Cut loose Scrooge's
Number One Dime
without him waking up

00:35.541 --> 00:37.141
while you yell at me
the whole time!

00:37.177 --> 00:39.912
[mumbles, sighs]

00:39.947 --> 00:42.082
I'm not yelling,
I'm whispering harshly!

00:42.117 --> 00:43.818
You want your freedom?
You do as I order.

00:43.853 --> 00:45.454
I'm not your puppet.

00:45.489 --> 00:47.356
You really want to hurt
Scrooge, be my guest.

00:47.391 --> 00:49.226
I would love to, but...

00:50.896 --> 00:53.098
-[groans] I miss carnage.
-[wolf howls]

00:53.133 --> 00:55.468
Quickly!
The lunar eclipse is coming.

00:55.503 --> 00:58.039
With it my power grows,
but it's futile
without the dime.

00:58.074 --> 01:00.809
-Would you just quiet down?
We don't want to get caught!
-[door opens]

01:00.844 --> 01:02.379

02:10.815 --> 02:13.284
off my hard-earned
milk and cookies, you--

02:13.319 --> 02:15.254
[exclaims]

02:17.792 --> 02:19.660
[groans]

02:21.964 --> 02:24.601
What were you doing
in Scrooge's room?

02:24.636 --> 02:26.637
-What were you doing there?
-Oh, nothing.

02:26.672 --> 02:29.041
Definitely not collecting
drool samples while he sleeps.

02:32.213 --> 02:34.181
No. You'd think
it's silly.

02:34.216 --> 02:36.017
What?

02:36.052 --> 02:38.754
Well, it's just,
Mr. McDuck's pretty cool.

02:38.789 --> 02:41.793
I may have caught a bit
of the obsession bug from you.

02:41.828 --> 02:45.031
Oh, no! Sorry you caught
the greatest disease ever!

02:45.066 --> 02:47.301
Ooh! Ooh!
Let's start a fan club!

02:47.336 --> 02:49.805
Ooh! The fan club should
start a blood oath!

02:49.840 --> 02:52.041
Oh! Let's take
a blood oath!

02:52.076 --> 02:54.178
Or... we could start

02:54.213 --> 02:56.715
by checking out
Scrooge's Number One Dime.

02:56.750 --> 02:58.684
Oh, I wish.
He keeps it to himself,

02:58.719 --> 03:00.687
that selfishly lovable
genius.

03:00.722 --> 03:03.124
But... I do have an exhaustively
researched presentation

03:03.159 --> 03:05.327
-on the life and times
of Scrooge McDuck!
-Oh, no.

03:05.362 --> 03:08.699
-Scotland, 1867. A duckling is
hatched to humble beginnings.
-[sighs]

03:08.734 --> 03:10.335
[both groan]

03:10.370 --> 03:12.905
[grunting]

03:12.940 --> 03:15.909
-And... time!
-[gasps]

03:15.945 --> 03:18.914
Did I do it? Did I break
the world record for doing-
slash-folding laundry?

03:18.949 --> 03:21.351
According to this
very real almanac,

03:21.386 --> 03:24.356
you... missed the record
by two seconds.

03:24.391 --> 03:26.393
Aw, man!

03:26.428 --> 03:28.929
I'm never gonna get
a world record in anything.

03:28.964 --> 03:33.102
Hey, winning the world record
in literally anything
is your dream,

03:33.137 --> 03:35.906
and I will always be there
to support that dream

03:35.941 --> 03:38.076
with piles
of dirty clothes.

03:38.111 --> 03:40.881
Oh!

03:40.916 --> 03:43.284
-What?
-Do you realize
how mad Dewey will be

03:43.319 --> 03:45.087
when he finds out you've been
taking advantage of him?

03:45.122 --> 03:48.024
Do you realize Dewey ruined
my favorite hoodie in the wash?

03:48.059 --> 03:49.827
So who's the real
victim here?

03:51.798 --> 03:54.033
[exclaiming]
Hey! No problem.

03:54.068 --> 03:56.837
how 'bout I darn it
and rewash it for you?
'Kay, bye!

03:58.308 --> 03:59.975
...until Scrooge realized

04:00.010 --> 04:01.745
his worst nightmare
was being caused

04:01.780 --> 04:03.313
by the mythical
dreamcatcher he found

04:03.348 --> 04:06.318
back on January 8th 1977!

04:06.353 --> 04:09.824
-What?!
On January 9, 1977...
-[snoring]

04:09.859 --> 04:12.294
[Scrooge] I'm telling you,
something is off in the mansion.

04:12.329 --> 04:15.298
Mr. McDuck,
I assure you, nothing
strange is going on here.

04:15.333 --> 04:17.767
Then how do you explain this?

04:17.803 --> 04:21.072
My Number One Dime
has been tampered with.

04:21.108 --> 04:24.111
But the filament is made
from un-cuttable enchanted
quadriamond.

04:24.146 --> 04:25.913
Anything that could
cut it would--

04:25.948 --> 04:28.852
Would have to be
supernatural.

04:28.887 --> 04:31.789
Hmm. There's something
afoot in this house,

04:31.824 --> 04:34.460
-and I'm gonna find out what.
-[gasps]

04:34.495 --> 04:36.295
Until I get to
the bottom of this,

04:36.330 --> 04:39.133
I'm putting the dime
in the other bin
for safekeeping.

04:39.168 --> 04:42.004
-[gasps]
-...making Scrooge McDuck

04:42.039 --> 04:44.976
the finest venture capitalist
the world will ever see.

04:45.011 --> 04:47.212
Now on to the slideshow!
I'm gonna get the projector.

04:47.247 --> 04:49.148
[groans]

04:49.183 --> 04:51.051
Well, you messed up.

04:51.086 --> 04:53.188
I literally haven't moved.

04:53.223 --> 04:54.991
You didn't move
fast enough before,

04:55.026 --> 04:57.194
and now our arch-nemesis
is onto us.

04:57.229 --> 05:00.465
Scrooge went and hid the dime
in something called
"the other bin."

05:00.500 --> 05:03.002
This is all your fault!

05:03.037 --> 05:06.207
Okay. You're mad.
But at least the dime
isn't on him anymore.

05:06.242 --> 05:10.013
We just got to find this
mysterious "other bin" thingy.
You're welcome.

05:10.048 --> 05:12.917
You just had to
waste your time

05:12.952 --> 05:16.222
with Lecture Girl
instead of sticking to the plan.

05:16.257 --> 05:17.925
Using her was
part of the plan.

05:17.960 --> 05:20.028
Then use her already!

05:20.063 --> 05:22.097
Okay, most of these are an
artist's rendering of the facts.

05:22.132 --> 05:23.399
But I drew them,
so they're amazing.

05:23.434 --> 05:25.068
Cool.

05:25.103 --> 05:27.271
Uh, real quick,
what's "the other bin"?

05:27.306 --> 05:29.274
-[gasps]
-Good. You've heard of it.

05:29.309 --> 05:31.377
Let's go!

05:31.412 --> 05:34.115
Oh, no-no-no.
The money bin is
where the money goes.

05:34.150 --> 05:36.117
The other bin
is for the other.

05:36.152 --> 05:38.288
-The bad things!
-[claps hands]

05:38.323 --> 05:41.459
Where Scrooge puts
all his most dangerous finds

05:41.494 --> 05:44.229
and artifacts to keep them
from prying hands.

05:44.264 --> 05:47.034
Why would you want
to go there?

05:47.069 --> 05:50.238
'Cause I just heard Scrooge say
he put his Number One Dime
in there.

05:50.273 --> 05:52.910
[gasps] He almost never
takes off the dime.

05:52.945 --> 05:55.046
Then we better go check it out
before he takes it back.

05:55.081 --> 05:57.450
Uh, I don't know.

05:57.485 --> 06:01.289
[sighs] You're telling me
there's a mystical room
in your own home

06:01.324 --> 06:03.425
that you've never been to
that contains Scrooge's
greatest secrets,

06:03.460 --> 06:06.329
and you <i> don't</i>
want to go there?

06:06.364 --> 06:08.199
Uhh...

06:09.269 --> 06:11.136
[sighs, mumbles]

06:12.373 --> 06:13.407
Aah! Okay, fine!

06:13.442 --> 06:15.309
To adventure!

06:18.315 --> 06:20.283
What? No.
I didn't do anything.

06:20.318 --> 06:22.420
Nothing is going on.
[awkward chuckle]

06:22.455 --> 06:24.256
So this isn't
your Bigfoot?

06:24.291 --> 06:26.126
[greeting growl]

06:26.161 --> 06:31.333
Wha-a-a-t?

06:31.368 --> 06:33.202
I can explain.

06:33.237 --> 06:35.939
<i>-I was in the woods</i>
<i>bird-watching.</i>
-[whimpers]

06:35.974 --> 06:40.147
<i>Little did I know,</i>
<i>something was watching me.</i>

06:40.182 --> 06:41.982
[groans]

06:45.556 --> 06:48.291
Easy, fella.

06:48.326 --> 06:49.393
[groans, gasps]

06:49.428 --> 06:52.030
[gasps, exclaims]

06:52.065 --> 06:53.566
[both laugh]

06:53.601 --> 06:56.336
Seems like your heart
is as tender as your feet.

06:56.371 --> 06:58.373
I shall call you
Tenderfeet!

06:58.408 --> 07:01.044
What started as
an anthropological find

07:01.079 --> 07:03.281
became a friendship
for the ages!

07:05.285 --> 07:06.518
Hey! He's stretching
out my hoodies!

07:06.553 --> 07:09.223
Hey-- No, hey.
That's my-- That's my--

07:13.000 --> 07:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:22.644 --> 07:25.581
Look what you did!
He's so sensitive.

07:25.616 --> 07:29.185
-You are family now.
-Oh, come on!

07:29.220 --> 07:31.589
We got to keep him a secret.
Uncle Scrooge is on the hunt!

07:31.624 --> 07:33.525
Which is why we should
hand him over.

07:33.560 --> 07:35.561
The last thing I need is Scrooge
snooping around and finding

07:35.596 --> 07:39.267
any number of my devious
yet delightful schemes.

07:39.302 --> 07:42.372
You mean all those schemes
we know about?

07:42.407 --> 07:44.442
Sure would be a shame
if Uncle Donald found out

07:44.477 --> 07:48.080
about that charity
he's been donating to
for the past three years.

07:48.115 --> 07:51.552
Hey, "Louie's Kids" takes
Uncle Donald's donations
for children in need.

07:51.587 --> 07:55.091
Children like me.
Children exactly like me.
It's for me.

07:55.126 --> 07:58.596
-[pleading grunt]
-I promise I'll fix your hoodie.

07:58.631 --> 08:01.534
Fine. I'll do it
for the children.

08:04.206 --> 08:08.344
The dime is secure.
Now the hunt is on.

08:16.657 --> 08:18.525
Based on Duckworth's
old cleaning schedule,

08:18.560 --> 08:21.530
the entrance to the other bin
is somewhere in here.

08:21.565 --> 08:25.202
-[clattering]
-[gasps]

08:25.237 --> 08:27.639
-Don't worry. It's just
some assorted zombie parts.
-[gasps]

08:27.674 --> 08:31.512
Scrooge sure seems to be good
at hunting monsters.

08:31.547 --> 08:34.049
He's never met a mystical foe
he couldn't defeat.

08:34.083 --> 08:35.549
Right, Zombie Hand?

08:35.585 --> 08:38.188
Well, that's...
comforting.

08:38.222 --> 08:40.792
According to this,
to find the bin,

08:40.827 --> 08:45.165
we must see through Scrooge's
eyes and get into his head.

08:45.200 --> 08:47.702
Looks like someone
already got to his head.

08:49.740 --> 08:53.644
"Through his eyes"?
[gasps] I see a painting!

08:53.679 --> 08:56.716
This must be it, but how
do we get into his head?

08:56.751 --> 08:59.220
[Webby]
What's he looking at?

09:06.264 --> 09:07.765
-[clicks]
-[gasps]

09:07.800 --> 09:09.201
Hey, let me see that.

09:21.754 --> 09:24.523
Wow! For a forbidden
danger chamber,

09:24.558 --> 09:26.459
this has been pretty easy.

09:26.494 --> 09:27.795
We should find the dime
in no time.

09:27.830 --> 09:30.566
-[voice echoes]
-[Lena] You were saying?

09:34.573 --> 09:37.777
Maybe we should do some more
research before we're,

09:37.812 --> 09:40.881
you know,
lost in here forever.
[nervous chuckle]

09:40.916 --> 09:43.251
So it's a little bigger
than we thought.

09:43.286 --> 09:45.454
It's still worth it
to find the dime.

09:45.489 --> 09:47.657
Fine, but we need
to take some time

09:47.692 --> 09:49.627
to figure out
which door to open.

09:50.931 --> 09:53.800
[gasps]

09:53.835 --> 09:55.936
Why is Scrooge hiding
a frilly unicorn?

09:55.971 --> 09:58.140
[gasps]
Sword horse!

09:58.175 --> 10:01.311
-[angry snort, whinnies]
-[screaming]

10:01.346 --> 10:04.616
[sighs] I need something
to calm my nerves.

Where's my Pep Select?

10:06.721 --> 10:08.422

-Hey! What are you doing?

10:16.001 --> 10:18.003
Tenderfeet!
There you are!

10:18.038 --> 10:20.539
-How do you keep
getting out, buddy?
-[quizzical grunt]

10:20.574 --> 10:22.977
Quit drinking
and eating the best snacks!
That's my thing!

10:23.012 --> 10:25.014
-[exclaiming]
-Hey!

10:25.049 --> 10:26.448
[whimpers]

10:26.483 --> 10:29.854
-Not cool, Louie.
-Relax, Louie.

10:29.889 --> 10:31.723
Tenderfeet doesn't
know any better.

10:31.758 --> 10:34.293
He's just a lovable,
simpleminded beast.

10:34.328 --> 10:37.799
Simpleminded?
He's making a sandwich
on a Panini press!

10:37.834 --> 10:40.870
Huh?
[chuckles] Eh...

10:40.905 --> 10:42.839
We gotta get him out of here
before Scrooge sees him.

10:42.874 --> 10:46.378
Here, boy.
Delicious bologna!

10:46.413 --> 10:48.715
[sniffs]
Ugh!

10:48.750 --> 10:52.020
[groans]
How about some fancy cheese?

10:52.055 --> 10:53.355
[excited grunt]

10:53.390 --> 10:55.792
[all gasp]

10:59.766 --> 11:02.669
Hmm. Still warm.

11:02.704 --> 11:04.872
Dill pickles
and salted ham.

11:04.907 --> 11:07.643
An excellent pairing
of flavors. Clever girl.

11:11.884 --> 11:13.652
-[unicorn whinnies]
-[gasps, exclaims]

11:14.822 --> 11:17.925
This is so dangerous.
Whee!

11:17.960 --> 11:21.230
Someone's wearing
her crazy pants today.

11:21.265 --> 11:22.966
-[whinnies]
-Let's ditch her
and find the dime.

11:23.001 --> 11:26.270
-We can't.
-Hmm. If I didn't
know any better,

11:26.305 --> 11:29.309
I'd say you valued
your little sidekick
over your own freedom.

11:29.344 --> 11:31.779
Oh, believe me,
I would do anything to
get you off my back.

11:31.814 --> 11:34.382
But without Webby,
I could be lost forever.

11:34.417 --> 11:36.319
Oh, no!
Webby! Catch!

11:36.354 --> 11:37.855
[gasps]

11:40.994 --> 11:42.695
[whinnies]

11:48.972 --> 11:51.474
-[panting]
-Okay. That was intense.

11:51.510 --> 11:53.912
We should go back,
develop a system,

11:53.947 --> 11:55.915
figure out where
to look safely.

11:55.950 --> 11:58.852
A system?
That could take months.
We gotta find the dime now,

11:58.887 --> 12:01.789
before Scrooge decides
to take it back!

12:01.825 --> 12:04.494
Why? What's the hurry?
Follow-up question:

12:04.529 --> 12:07.065
Where'd you get
a diamond dagger from anyway?

12:08.735 --> 12:11.204
Uh, hey, look!
Mysteries!

12:11.239 --> 12:13.674
6-4-5-6.

12:13.709 --> 12:16.612
[gasps]
Or 6/4/56!

12:16.647 --> 12:19.349
Yes. Mm-hmm.
Numbers.

12:19.384 --> 12:21.886
They're dates!
June 4, 1956,

12:21.921 --> 12:24.156
the day Scrooge captured
the sword horse.

12:24.191 --> 12:25.792
And, as you'll recall
from today's lecture,

12:25.827 --> 12:28.964
the date Scrooge earned
his Number One Dime was...

12:28.999 --> 12:32.168
[incoherent mumbling]

12:32.203 --> 12:34.973
1877!
Come on!

12:35.008 --> 12:38.211
Tenderfeet!
Here, Tenderfeet!

12:38.246 --> 12:41.216
How do you keep losing
a <i> giant</i> monster?

12:41.251 --> 12:43.752
Just because we like him
better than you doesn't mean
you have to hate him.

12:43.787 --> 12:45.755
Wait, what?
I am your brother!

12:45.790 --> 12:47.658
You met this thing,
like, a day ago!

12:47.693 --> 12:50.062
Well, he never tricked me
into doing his laundry.

12:50.097 --> 12:51.898
Yeah,
I know about that.

12:51.933 --> 12:53.968
We gotta split up
to find him.

12:57.374 --> 13:00.044
-[can top opens, slurping]
-[Tenderfeet] Whoo-hoo!

13:02.081 --> 13:06.253
Dudes, I'm telling you,
this mansion is sick!
Check it!

13:06.288 --> 13:09.056
<i>Bro, there's</i>
<i>so much mahogany.</i>

13:09.091 --> 13:11.560
Right?
This con is killer.

13:11.595 --> 13:13.563
I'm all like,
"Ruh, ruh, ruh,"

13:13.598 --> 13:16.735
and these dummies let me
do whatever I want.

13:16.770 --> 13:19.372
<i>Dude!</i>
<i>You're the man, Gavin!</i>

13:19.407 --> 13:21.975
Uh, yeah. Guess who has
two opposable thumbs

13:22.010 --> 13:25.080
and is inviting you all over
for a massive party?

13:25.115 --> 13:27.951
-Uh, this guy!
-[all exclaiming]

13:27.986 --> 13:30.288
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Anyway,
I'll group-text you the deets.

13:30.323 --> 13:33.760
-Gavin out.
-Gavin out, indeed.

13:33.795 --> 13:37.832
Huh? Oh, I mean...
[clears throat, quizzical grunt]

13:37.867 --> 13:40.169
Can't out-con
a con, bro.

13:40.204 --> 13:43.007
Oh, Uncle Scrooge!

13:43.042 --> 13:46.945
So, you figured out the Bigfoot
in your house is scamming you.

13:46.980 --> 13:50.184
Problem is, the Bigfoot
in your house is scamming you.

13:50.219 --> 13:52.521
-[knuckles crack]
-And, yeah, bro, he lifts!

13:52.556 --> 13:54.624
[grunting]

13:54.659 --> 13:56.627
[chuckles, gasps]

13:56.662 --> 13:58.430
What? Did you see
something, lad?

13:58.465 --> 14:01.100
Uh, well...

14:01.135 --> 14:02.803
Oh.... Oh, my.

14:02.838 --> 14:05.273
Uh... no.

14:05.308 --> 14:07.811
Wasting my time.

14:07.846 --> 14:09.814
And pick up
that trash!

14:09.849 --> 14:12.818
-[chuckles, gasps]
-Tenderfeet!

14:12.853 --> 14:16.123
-[both gasp]
-[fearful grunts]

14:16.158 --> 14:18.993
Aw. Was mean ol' Louie
mean again?

14:19.028 --> 14:21.230
-Mm-hmm.
-[grunts]

14:21.265 --> 14:23.934
Oh, it's okay, boy.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.475
Oh Bigfoot,
you just poked the bear.

14:28.510 --> 14:30.210
Here we go.

14:30.245 --> 14:33.215
1877.
Scrooge's Number One Dime.

14:33.250 --> 14:35.418
This is it!

14:42.931 --> 14:46.234
Hey, Lena, I think you
locked me out accidentally.

14:46.269 --> 14:49.105
[maniacal laughing]
Yes!

14:49.140 --> 14:50.907
The time is at hand.

14:50.943 --> 14:54.212
Closer, fool.
Closer!

14:54.247 --> 14:57.951
What are you waiting for?
An invitation?

14:57.986 --> 14:59.988
Take the dime!

15:01.992 --> 15:05.129
-Yes!
-[electricity crackling]

15:06.399 --> 15:08.467
[gasping, screams]

15:08.502 --> 15:12.106
Finally!
The power!

15:17.682 --> 15:19.450
Oh, that felt good.

15:19.485 --> 15:21.386
With the dime
in my hands,

15:21.421 --> 15:24.758
nothing can stand
in my way!

15:24.793 --> 15:27.228
[maniacal laughing]

15:27.263 --> 15:29.398
[gasping]

15:29.433 --> 15:31.034
Wait.

15:34.774 --> 15:37.510
-[whimpers]
-You deserve a hug.

15:37.545 --> 15:40.080
-[sawing]
-Huh?

15:40.115 --> 15:42.283
Diamond dagger
cuts through anything!

15:42.318 --> 15:45.188
Wait, what's going on?
Is that...

15:45.223 --> 15:48.326
Yep. The harbinger
of your doom.

15:50.832 --> 15:52.867
Oh, no! The dime!
Give it back!

15:53.869 --> 15:56.137
Lena, run!

15:56.172 --> 15:59.176
Why? She's been
working for me.

16:03.918 --> 16:05.853
-Scrooge!
-Ha!

16:07.490 --> 16:08.890
Webby! No!

16:08.925 --> 16:10.526
She keeps
barging in.

16:10.561 --> 16:12.496
We've gotta put a bell
on her or something.

16:15.902 --> 16:19.205
-What are you doing?
-Exactly what you've
been doing the whole time.

16:19.240 --> 16:22.410
Using her,
Pulling her strings. Here.

16:22.445 --> 16:25.849
Allow me to demonstrate
the delightful irony.

16:32.794 --> 16:35.262
[imitating Webby]
Scrooge this.
Scrooge that.

16:35.297 --> 16:38.568
Pink stuff.
Hi, I'm Webster!"
Or whatever.

16:38.603 --> 16:41.004
-Her name is Webby!
-[Magica] Who cares?

16:41.039 --> 16:44.777
I mean, you don't.
You were just using her,
right? Like a tool.

16:44.812 --> 16:47.847
What's the matter?
Do you miss your friend,
the slide ruler?

16:47.882 --> 16:49.116
[imitating Webby]
Good one, Magica.

16:49.151 --> 16:50.919
Thanks, dummy. Ha!

16:50.954 --> 16:53.022
Little prop humor
for you there.

16:53.057 --> 16:55.926
[laughs]
Good times.

16:55.961 --> 16:57.529
Now,
give me the dime.

16:57.564 --> 17:01.468
I'm not doing anything
until you turn Webby back.

17:01.503 --> 17:02.937
I'm sorry. I must
have misheard you.

17:02.972 --> 17:05.107
Are you telling
your master what to do?

17:05.142 --> 17:07.242
Because that doesn't
sound like someone
who wants her freedom,

17:07.278 --> 17:09.079
does it, Wendy?

17:09.115 --> 17:13.219
Let's try this again.
Give. Me. The dime!

17:13.253 --> 17:15.321
No! I'm not
your puppet anymore!

17:15.357 --> 17:17.659
Is that so?

17:17.694 --> 17:19.962
Luckily,
I have a spare.

17:19.997 --> 17:21.364
[gasps]

17:23.300 --> 17:25.069
[Magica imitating Webby]
You're not my friend!

17:25.104 --> 17:27.906
You're a coward!
A traitor!

17:27.942 --> 17:31.847
-[pulsating]
-No! Webby, this isn't you!

17:31.882 --> 17:34.017
[Magica imitating Webby]
I know who you really are:

17:34.052 --> 17:37.154
a monster,
just like your aunt!

17:40.127 --> 17:43.297
[screaming]

17:45.034 --> 17:47.202
Whoops. She gone.

17:47.237 --> 17:51.175
No-o-o!

17:51.210 --> 17:53.945
Lena! Wake up,
you snoring angel.

17:53.980 --> 17:56.449
Webby?
Where's the dime? Where--

17:56.484 --> 17:59.154
There is no dime.
There never was.

17:59.189 --> 18:02.692
The dreamcatcher.
From the lecture?
It sucked you into--

18:02.728 --> 18:05.396
-My worst nightmare...
-Aw, you <i> were</i> listening.

18:05.431 --> 18:07.399
I got the code wrong.

18:07.434 --> 18:09.569
This one is 1/8/77.

18:09.604 --> 18:12.306
We need 1877. Come on!

18:12.341 --> 18:14.142
No. I'm done.

18:14.177 --> 18:17.481
Let's get out of here before
anything else bad happens.

18:17.516 --> 18:20.652
What? No! No! No! No!

18:20.687 --> 18:23.089
[snoring]

18:24.526 --> 18:26.694
[electric shaver whirring]

18:26.729 --> 18:29.599
-Huey! Dewey! Come quick!
-[gasps]

18:29.634 --> 18:32.536
[gasps] Tenderfeet!
What's wrong?

18:32.571 --> 18:35.373
What the-- I mean...
[confused grunt]

18:35.408 --> 18:37.277
-[grunting]
-[mirror shatters]

18:39.281 --> 18:41.216
He's losing his hair.
[gasps]

18:41.251 --> 18:43.185
Without the majestic
power of the woods,

18:43.220 --> 18:45.455
Tenderfeet...
he's dying.

18:45.490 --> 18:49.194
-[growls]
-Stupid majestic woods!

18:49.229 --> 18:52.132
-[grunting gasp]
-We must take him back
where he belongs

18:52.167 --> 18:55.270
before it's too late.

18:55.305 --> 18:57.407
[grunting, exclaiming]

19:05.153 --> 19:07.722
Aha! A Bigfoot!

19:07.757 --> 19:12.328
I knew there was something
strange... afoot.

19:12.363 --> 19:14.632
No, please don't!
He's our friend.

19:14.667 --> 19:18.404
His name is Tenderfeet,
but his soul is tender too.

19:18.439 --> 19:21.676
We brought him out of
the woods into the mansion
and right into our hearts.

19:21.711 --> 19:23.479
We thought
we were saving him,

19:23.514 --> 19:26.449
but in a way,
he was saving us.

19:26.484 --> 19:28.252
You know what
that's like, right?

19:28.287 --> 19:30.255
Maybe Tenderfeet
is someone's nephew.

19:30.290 --> 19:32.792
And he must return
home to his own uncle.

19:32.827 --> 19:35.396
Eh. Go ahead.

19:37.167 --> 19:39.168
[sighs]
When we first met,

19:39.203 --> 19:41.438
there was a thorn
in your paw, but now...

19:41.473 --> 19:42.841
-It's in here.
-[sobs]

19:45.679 --> 19:48.349
[whimpering]

19:51.255 --> 19:53.456
[whispers]
I win.

19:53.491 --> 19:57.162
Now, go back
from whence you came!

19:57.197 --> 19:58.831
This is for
your own good.

19:58.866 --> 20:01.168
Go on.

20:01.203 --> 20:03.238
-Get out here. Go!
-[grunting]

20:03.273 --> 20:06.308
Go! Go!

20:06.343 --> 20:07.477
Bye, Tenderfeet.
I love you.

20:07.512 --> 20:09.347
Have fun living
in the gross woods

20:09.382 --> 20:10.682
and not our awesome
mansion anymore!

20:10.717 --> 20:12.317
Stupid duck
with a hoodie.

20:12.352 --> 20:14.687
You did
a good thing, Louie.

20:14.723 --> 20:19.495
That's what Louie's Kids
is all about.

20:19.530 --> 20:22.366
You know, this was fun,
but I'm kind of glad
we stopped.

20:22.401 --> 20:24.369
I was a little nervous
about the whole thing.

20:24.404 --> 20:27.374
I know. And I'm sorry
I forced you to do something
you didn't want to do.

20:27.409 --> 20:29.410
-What the blazes are
you two doing in here?
-[both gasp]

20:32.582 --> 20:35.452
Oh, of course!
The Number One Dime

20:35.487 --> 20:37.756
was in the number one
chamber. Duh.

20:37.791 --> 20:40.359
No one thinks to check
the first one.

20:40.394 --> 20:42.529
But you shouldn't be
checking at all!

20:42.564 --> 20:44.565
The other bin
is far too dangerous.

20:44.600 --> 20:46.902
It's on me.
We wanted to see your dime,

20:46.937 --> 20:50.308
-and we overheard you were
keeping it in here and--
-Sorry, Uncle Scrooge.

20:50.343 --> 20:52.411
You should know by now that
if you want to know something,

20:52.446 --> 20:54.247
all you have to do is ask.

20:54.282 --> 20:55.915
Be straight
with me lassie.

20:55.951 --> 20:58.420
What if you were lost or hurt
or eaten by the dragon?

21:00.291 --> 21:02.392
Aw, man!
There's a dragon in here?

21:02.427 --> 21:05.296
Blech.
Now, listen to your aunt

21:05.331 --> 21:08.300
and grab the dime,
grab the dime,
grab the dime!

21:08.336 --> 21:11.339
No! Family is
supposed to help you,
not hold you hostage.

21:11.374 --> 21:13.308
They'll turn on you.
Call you a monster.

21:13.343 --> 21:14.577
You're the monster here.

21:14.612 --> 21:17.514
And I know just the hunter
to take you down.

21:17.549 --> 21:20.618
Mr. McDuck, there's
something I need to tell you.

21:20.653 --> 21:23.256
My aunt is ma...

21:23.291 --> 21:27.296
ma... ma-a-ad

21:27.331 --> 21:31.268
that I haven't
checked in with her.

21:31.303 --> 21:32.870
I got to go.

21:32.905 --> 21:34.673
Well, come on then,
lass.

21:34.708 --> 21:37.277
Let's get you home
to your family.

21:37.312 --> 21:38.713
[whimpering]

21:40.316 --> 21:42.752
[panting]

21:47.661 --> 21:51.398
[Magica's voice]
