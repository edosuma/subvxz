to you for a minute?

19:21.953 --> 19:24.288
Sure. Hey, excuse us.

19:28.459 --> 19:30.628
You know, maybe all

19:28.459 --> 19:30.628
this is happening

19:30.670 --> 19:33.213
so that we could

19:30.670 --> 19:33.213
have a second chance.

19:33.255 --> 19:34.757
You know, Danny

19:33.255 --> 19:34.757
really likes you.

19:36.216 --> 19:38.302
Jesse, I can't believe you

19:38.344 --> 19:41.388
didn't feel anything when you

19:38.344 --> 19:41.388
saw me standing there tonight.

And if it doesn't work out

19:44.308 --> 19:46.894
with you and Danny, that's okay.

19:46.936 --> 19:50.230
But, I don't wanna

19:46.936 --> 19:50.230
be the reason.

19:50.272 --> 19:51.565
I understand.

19:51.607 --> 19:53.609
It just wasn't meant to be.

19:55.069 --> 19:57.196
But I just have one question.

19:57.237 --> 19:59.157
Oh, yeah? What's that?

19:59.198 --> 20:00.449
Why are you living in a room

20:00.491 --> 20:02.785

20:22.930 --> 20:24.348

20:43.659 --> 20:45.912
But I panicked.

20:45.953 --> 20:49.540
in responsibility.
