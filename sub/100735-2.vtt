WEBVTT

01:55.824 --> 01:57.993
So don't wanna go for my run.

02:06.335 --> 02:07.586
We need to talk.

02:12.382 --> 02:13.592
One.

02:14.593 --> 02:15.636
Two.

02:16.929 --> 02:18.222
Three!

02:27.481 --> 02:28.482
What?

02:29.066 --> 02:30.859
You wanna tell us what this is?

02:33.195 --> 02:34.488
You were snooping in my room?

02:34.571 --> 02:37.199
I was. Not your mother.
That's not the point.

02:38.575 --> 02:40.494
It's just something I got.
It's not a big deal.

02:40.577 --> 02:41.745
Not a big deal?

02:41.828 --> 02:43.205
Then why didn't you tell us?

02:43.288 --> 02:45.207
I only hid it because
I knew you'd freak out.

02:45.290 --> 02:46.500
You got that part right.

02:46.583 --> 02:47.793
Did you buy it online?

02:50.003 --> 02:52.172
No, at the army-navy store in town.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.676
I paid for it, by the way,
with my own money.

02:55.759 --> 02:56.760
I'm just saying.

02:57.469 --> 02:58.470
When was this?

02:58.554 --> 03:00.639
I don't know. Couple months ago.

03:00.722 --> 03:01.807
Ever bring it to school?

03:02.683 --> 03:04.393
Just once, to show some people.

03:04.476 --> 03:05.477
Who?

03:06.436 --> 03:10.566
Derek, Dylan.
I was just like, "Hey, check this out."

03:13.443 --> 03:14.695
Have you ever used it?

03:15.112 --> 03:16.113
Like for what?

03:16.196 --> 03:18.156
For whatever you use a knife for.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.537
You read Derek's post, didn't you?

03:23.620 --> 03:26.540
-Why would he write that?
-'Cause he's an asshole. That's why.

03:26.623 --> 03:28.792
You didn't answer my question.
Have you ever used it?

03:28.876 --> 03:30.127
Like to stab somebody?

03:31.628 --> 03:33.505
No. How could you even ask me that?

03:33.589 --> 03:34.840
Because I have to.

03:34.923 --> 03:36.800
Because I have to know
with absolute certainty

03:36.884 --> 03:39.136
that this isn't the knife
they're looking for.

03:40.596 --> 03:42.931
-Well?
-Andy, he just told you.

03:43.265 --> 03:45.976
Can't believe this,
that you even think that about me.

03:46.059 --> 03:47.519
-Of course we don't.
-Yeah, whatever.

03:47.603 --> 03:50.564
Hey, hey.
Look, we believe every word you've said.

03:50.647 --> 03:52.816
We just wanna know why
Derek wrote what he wrote.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.526
We thought he was your friend.

03:54.610 --> 03:55.611
He is.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.197
-It's not a big deal.
-Not a big deal?

03:58.280 --> 04:00.741
Jake, he accused you of murder
in a public forum.

04:00.824 --> 04:02.618
No one means what they say on there.

04:02.701 --> 04:06.038
That's what kids do, they just talk shit
and they try to sound cool.

04:06.121 --> 04:07.122
That's all it is.

04:09.374 --> 04:11.752
So you're not at all bothered
by what he wrote?

04:12.294 --> 04:17.341
I mean-- Yes, I am, a little bit,
but he was just being a dick.

04:18.841 --> 04:20.302
No one takes it seriously.

04:21.428 --> 04:22.429
Honest.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.894
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
about the knife, okay?

04:32.606 --> 04:33.774
Can I have it back now?

04:34.358 --> 04:35.984
That's not even remotely funny.

04:36.068 --> 04:38.070
Well-- I bought it. It's mine.

04:38.153 --> 04:39.154
Not anymore.

04:42.991 --> 04:44.451
I'm gonna be late for school.

04:45.577 --> 04:47.829
Well, I can drive you,
if you wanna wait a few.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.289
No, it's fine. I'll walk.

04:49.373 --> 04:50.666
What time will you be home?

04:51.083 --> 04:53.502
I don't know. I might stay for math.

04:54.002 --> 04:55.003
Come here.

04:56.213 --> 04:57.589
I love you, okay?

04:58.507 --> 04:59.675
Love you too.

04:59.758 --> 05:00.759
Hey.

05:06.682 --> 05:07.850
I shouldn't have yelled.

05:18.485 --> 05:22.823
God. Fucking Derek.
What kind of idiot writes that online?

05:24.950 --> 05:26.201
So what do we do now?

05:26.285 --> 05:27.452
Do we need to report it?

05:27.536 --> 05:30.080
No. God, no. What's to report?

05:30.163 --> 05:32.499
It's just he's been accused
and we know about it.

05:32.583 --> 05:34.918
It's not like the police
aren't going to find out anyway.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.337
-It's right there online.
-It's not a credible accusation.

05:37.421 --> 05:40.048
There's no reason to bring
the whole world down on Jacob's head.

05:40.132 --> 05:43.886
Trust me, it's better just to let this go.

05:47.598 --> 05:48.682
What do we do with it?

05:48.765 --> 05:51.476
I don't know. I'll put it somewhere.

05:51.560 --> 05:52.561
Are you sure?

05:53.729 --> 05:57.774
Honey, it's not a crime to own a knife
or to be a stupid teenager.

06:01.987 --> 06:04.198
Thank God.
We'd have to lock up half of 'em.

06:17.711 --> 06:18.879
And here you go.

06:19.630 --> 06:20.631
Hi.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.549
-Can I help you?
-I certainly hope so.

06:23.383 --> 06:26.261
And she wanted this item we didn't have.

06:27.054 --> 06:29.139
So I try to explain that we don't have it.

06:29.223 --> 06:32.601
But she was supposed to get it,
so she starts flipping out.

06:33.393 --> 06:36.313
And then she started yelling at me,
throwing a tantrum.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.065
I was, like, getting nervous.

06:38.148 --> 06:41.777
'Cause she was coming at my neck,
so then eventually I called the security.

06:41.860 --> 06:44.238
Guard came, tackled her right down.

06:47.157 --> 06:48.575
Since when do we even have security?

06:49.618 --> 06:53.038
Turns out we do.
And they're pretty good as well.

06:53.121 --> 06:54.122
I'm sure it is.

07:02.130 --> 07:03.340
Leonard Patz.

07:03.799 --> 07:07.094
Detective Peterson.
Newton Police Department.

07:07.177 --> 07:09.096
I'd like to ask you some questions, sir.

08:43.690 --> 08:45.150
-Hey.
-Hey.

08:45.984 --> 08:47.319
I can't stop thinking about it.

08:47.903 --> 08:50.989
I have to assume that every kid in school
has seen those posts.

08:51.073 --> 08:53.033
Their parents too, probably.

08:53.116 --> 08:55.494
Cara gave me this look
this morning when I came in.

08:55.577 --> 08:57.454
Her daughter's a sophomore
at the high school.

08:57.538 --> 09:00.582
Honey, if people wanna gossip,
they're gonna gossip.

09:00.666 --> 09:01.917
It doesn't mean anything.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.545
-I was thinking I should call Dina.
-Who?

09:04.628 --> 09:08.257
Dina Yoo. Maybe she has some insight
into what's going on with the boys.

09:08.340 --> 09:10.509
At the very least I could ask her
to talk to Derek.

09:10.592 --> 09:12.970
Tell him not to post any more
of these reckless comments.

09:13.053 --> 09:16.098
I think that's a mistake. My gut says
that if Jacob's not upset by it, then--

09:16.181 --> 09:18.725
He says he wasn't upset.
That doesn't mean he isn't.

09:19.518 --> 09:21.603
Honey, I got to jump off.
I'm at the station.

09:21.687 --> 09:23.522
There may have been a break in the case.

09:23.605 --> 09:25.566
-Really?
-Yeah, there's a guy we like for it.

09:25.649 --> 09:27.985
The cops just picked him up,
so I got to get in there.

09:28.068 --> 09:29.111
Okay.

09:29.194 --> 09:31.905
I hope it's something.
You'll call me later?

09:32.322 --> 09:33.532
Of course. Bye.

09:33.615 --> 09:34.616
Bye.

09:49.882 --> 09:52.176
Same kind of kid
you showed interest in before.

09:52.676 --> 09:54.094
-Morning.
-Hey, morning.

09:54.595 --> 09:55.596
How's it going?

09:55.679 --> 09:58.432
Well, they got him to admit
to being in the park the morning of.

09:58.515 --> 09:59.516
And that's it so far.

10:00.809 --> 10:03.687
-What, you got him in the broom closet?
-It's the remodel.

10:04.396 --> 10:07.191
The interrogation room is
the only room we don't use that much.

10:07.274 --> 10:08.525
Is my lawyer here yet?

10:10.652 --> 10:12.154
You said my lawyer was coming.

10:13.655 --> 10:14.698
She's on her way.

10:18.577 --> 10:20.662
Look, I never hurt anyone, okay?

10:21.788 --> 10:24.917
-Just look at my file. You'll see.
-This has nothing to do with your file.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.503
We're just trying to get a clear picture
of what happened in the park.

10:27.586 --> 10:29.463
You can understand why we'd be curious.

10:29.546 --> 10:31.965
Same kind of kid you went after
last time. Same type.

10:33.091 --> 10:35.636
I'm not feeling very well.

10:41.934 --> 10:43.852
You want something from the machines?

10:44.603 --> 10:45.771
No, thank you.

11:12.923 --> 11:14.299
We're pissing in the wind.

11:14.633 --> 11:16.927
-How long you been at him?
-Almost an hour now.

11:17.177 --> 11:18.637
Good, let him sit. Get him thinking.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.764
We don't have that kind of time.
His lawyer's on the way.

11:20.848 --> 11:22.266
This is what I was worried about.

11:22.349 --> 11:23.767
-Take another run at him.
-Andy.

11:23.851 --> 11:25.978
Tell him you found the knife.
See if that gets you anything.

11:29.731 --> 11:30.732
What?

11:30.816 --> 11:32.568
I don't think he's our guy.

11:32.860 --> 11:34.695
I can't pin it down. It's just a hunch.

11:36.113 --> 11:37.990
I'm on the fence,
but I'm not feeling it either.

11:38.073 --> 11:39.199
This is our only lead.

11:39.283 --> 11:41.285
I'm getting pressure from my office,
from the community.

11:41.368 --> 11:44.288
You don't think I'm feeling it too?
It's all I hear about.

11:46.832 --> 11:48.625
-If you want us to try again--
-I do.

11:49.793 --> 11:50.961
You're the boss.

12:04.016 --> 12:07.019
I have a headache. Can I please go?

12:07.686 --> 12:10.397
Leonard, we're trying to exclude you here.

12:10.480 --> 12:11.607
We wanna rule you out.

12:12.191 --> 12:13.192
Okay.

12:13.650 --> 12:14.902
Well, I told you.

12:16.278 --> 12:18.989
I was in the park
because I walk there every morning.

12:19.990 --> 12:24.036
And I was nowhere near
where the kid got killed.

12:24.786 --> 12:27.247
I never go that way. Ever.

12:28.832 --> 12:32.085
I mean, I don't even know who the kid is.

12:33.128 --> 12:35.631
You know, I've never seen him.
Never heard of him.

12:37.132 --> 12:38.217
You know.

12:39.009 --> 12:40.093
What about the knife?

12:43.305 --> 12:44.556
What knife?

12:44.640 --> 12:45.849
Do you own a knife?

12:47.267 --> 12:49.978
I mean, yeah, I have some for cooking.

12:50.062 --> 12:51.313
How many would you say?

12:51.396 --> 12:53.065
-Did you say 207?
-Yeah, that's right.

12:53.148 --> 12:54.316
Okay. Thank you.

12:54.650 --> 12:55.776
I don't know.

12:58.153 --> 13:00.781
Andy, don't tell me
this stunt was your doing.

13:00.864 --> 13:02.533
Joanna. Patz is yours?

13:02.616 --> 13:05.369
No. I'm just covering for a friend.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.204
May I see Mr. Patz, please?

13:07.287 --> 13:09.373
He's only here as a potential witness,
not a suspect.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.500
Right,
and I just got drafted by the Celtics.

13:11.583 --> 13:12.751
You need to come clean.

13:13.126 --> 13:14.419
You got a real class act here.

13:14.503 --> 13:17.381
You read his file? I tell you,
I don't know how you guys do it sometimes.

13:17.464 --> 13:20.217
Now that is a shame,
because you would be good at it.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.468
Trust me on this.

13:21.552 --> 13:23.637
Of course, you'll switch off
the camera and the microphone.

13:23.720 --> 13:24.721
Yeah, of course.

13:24.805 --> 13:26.515
We'll give you another room,
if you want one.

13:26.598 --> 13:28.767
That's not necessary.
We won't be here long.

13:29.643 --> 13:30.936
Besides, I trust ya.

13:31.019 --> 13:32.688
Enough to let me keep questioning him?

13:32.771 --> 13:34.857
No. I trust you too much for that.

13:35.399 --> 13:36.400
Detectives.

13:38.694 --> 13:40.779
Mr. Patz, I'm Joanna Klein.

13:40.863 --> 13:41.989
You're my lawyer?

13:42.364 --> 13:43.490
Just for today.

13:43.574 --> 13:47.452
Ms. Cronin is stuck in court.
She asked me to fill in for her.

13:47.786 --> 13:48.787
Okay.

14:00.382 --> 14:04.553
The final answer is therefore 5X.

14:06.388 --> 14:09.016
-Did you see what he wrote?
-I can't...

14:09.099 --> 14:11.852
If you have 2X...

14:15.856 --> 14:17.357
Derek is always saying shit.

14:21.111 --> 14:24.323
Attention, please. This is a reminder
to those students who have signed up

14:24.406 --> 14:26.408
to help the police
search Cold Spring Park.

14:26.491 --> 14:29.703
We will be gathering in the lower
gymnasium at 2:45 this afternoon

14:29.786 --> 14:31.747
and walking to the park as a group.

14:32.956 --> 14:35.667
-Sorry, sorry. My bad.
-My fault.

14:38.712 --> 14:41.048
All right, I'll see you.

14:43.008 --> 14:44.218
I--

14:45.344 --> 14:48.764
I think you should know
Derek's been saying some shit about you.

14:49.223 --> 14:51.016
Like, really bad.

14:52.851 --> 14:55.938
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I saw what he said online.

14:56.021 --> 14:57.940
Not just that stuff he said online.

14:59.733 --> 15:01.151
There's other things too.

15:03.570 --> 15:04.571
Sarah!

15:06.114 --> 15:07.115
Sarah!

15:07.199 --> 15:08.951
We should maybe talk later, okay?

15:10.118 --> 15:11.328
Yeah. All right.

15:15.832 --> 15:17.251
Did you get the Global assignment?

15:17.334 --> 15:19.711
I missed this morning
for the stupid orthodontist.

15:19.795 --> 15:20.796
Yeah, sure.

15:27.261 --> 15:30.180
Please report to the group leaders
you've been assigned to.

15:31.056 --> 15:34.977
If you do not have an assignment,
the tables back here have volunteers.

15:35.060 --> 15:37.563
They will be happy to assign
a group leader to you.

15:43.026 --> 15:46.822
Again, please report to the group
you've been assigned to.

15:46.905 --> 15:48.657
If you do not have an assignment,

15:48.740 --> 15:52.244
the volunteers at any of these tables
can assign a group leader to you.

16:15.475 --> 16:16.476
Mr. Barber.

16:16.560 --> 16:17.644
Any luck so far?

16:17.728 --> 16:20.898
No, not yet, but we still got
a couple hours of daylight left.

16:21.648 --> 16:22.900
Okay if I hang back here?

16:22.983 --> 16:24.276
Sure, wherever you want.

16:29.489 --> 16:32.868
Half the town came out to the park
to search for the missing knife.

16:32.951 --> 16:35.120
You didn't take part
in that search, did you?

16:35.746 --> 16:36.830
I did not.

16:38.248 --> 16:39.333
Why was that?

16:40.918 --> 16:44.421
Prosecutor never takes part
in a search like that, and you know it.

16:44.505 --> 16:47.007
You run the risk of becoming
a witness in your own case.

16:47.090 --> 16:51.011
Or could it be that you knew that
the knife that they were searching for

16:51.094 --> 16:52.804
had already been found and disposed of?

16:52.888 --> 16:56.141
Jesus Christ, you got to be kidding me.
What is this, Perry Mason?

17:00.103 --> 17:04.816
Did you or did you not
find a knife in your son's room?

17:05.233 --> 17:08.237
You know I did.
Jacob told the detectives that himself.

17:08.319 --> 17:09.695
And where is that knife now?

17:09.780 --> 17:13.032
-Getting in the weeds here, Neal.
-Let me worry about the weeds, Andy.

17:14.535 --> 17:16.161
Jacob's knife was never found.

17:17.746 --> 17:18.829
What happened to it?

17:20.958 --> 17:21.959
Andy?

17:26.380 --> 17:28.924
-I threw it away.
-You mean you got rid of it.

17:29.007 --> 17:32.386
No, I mean I threw it away.
The same way any parent would.

17:32.469 --> 17:33.929
But you weren't just any parent.

17:34.012 --> 17:36.431
I was protecting him
from his own stupidity.

17:38.433 --> 17:39.518
I was being a father.

17:40.102 --> 17:43.480
You mean to tell me that you aren't
the least bit troubled by your actions?

17:44.773 --> 17:47.818
Even now,
after everything that's happened?

17:47.901 --> 17:49.444
No. It was the wrong knife.

17:49.528 --> 17:51.238
But how could you possibly know that?

17:52.114 --> 17:55.742
You never turned it in for forensic
testing, for blood or fiber traces.

17:55.826 --> 17:57.870
I didn't need testing. I knew my son.

17:57.953 --> 17:59.913
That's it? That's your justification?

18:01.915 --> 18:03.041
"I knew my son"?

18:09.756 --> 18:10.799
I knew my son.

18:11.800 --> 18:13.927
Dispatch, this is 1-Baker-1.

18:14.011 --> 18:15.262
-Thanks, Dave.
-You bet.

18:15.345 --> 18:17.389
We've got two units heading to the corner.

18:17.472 --> 18:19.516
You want them posted up there, correct?

18:19.600 --> 18:21.602
That's correct, 1-Baker-1.

18:23.478 --> 18:28.442
...624. We're at Beechwood Road.

18:28.525 --> 18:30.736
We've got that area covered.

18:34.156 --> 18:35.157
Dan?

18:35.240 --> 18:37.951
Someone told me they saw you.
What the hell are you doing here?

18:38.035 --> 18:39.036
Where else would I be?

18:39.119 --> 18:41.663
I told him. I said I want another DA.

18:42.247 --> 18:44.374
Someone who's not just gonna
sit on his hands.

18:46.335 --> 18:47.961
Dan, I don't know
what I've done to upset you.

18:48.045 --> 18:50.464
It doesn't matter.
They're taking you off the case.

18:50.923 --> 18:52.174
Excuse me?

18:52.257 --> 18:54.718
You don't believe me?
Call your boss. Go ahead.

18:56.178 --> 18:57.179
You talked to Lynn?

18:57.262 --> 18:58.555
You're out, Andy.

18:59.181 --> 19:00.599
Thank fucking God.

19:02.226 --> 19:03.852
Dan. Dan!

19:11.735 --> 19:12.986
Lynn Canavan's office.

19:13.278 --> 19:15.697
-It's Andy Barber.
-Yes. Just a minute.

19:18.617 --> 19:20.118
-Hello, Andy.
-Lynn, hi. Listen, I--

19:20.202 --> 19:22.079
I need you to come down here right away.

19:24.915 --> 19:25.916
Is something wrong?

19:25.999 --> 19:28.961
Just come back to the office.
Okay? Please.

19:29.419 --> 19:31.046
We need to talk face-to-face.

19:31.129 --> 19:32.130
Yeah, okay.

19:57.072 --> 19:58.532
Copy that.

20:20.846 --> 20:21.847
Mr. Barber.

20:23.599 --> 20:25.392
DA asked us to escort you in.

20:27.269 --> 20:28.770
-You serious?
-Yeah.

20:32.149 --> 20:33.942
Jesus Christ.

20:39.907 --> 20:43.243
-How you doing, Kingston?
-Hanging in there, Mr. Barber. You good?

20:45.913 --> 20:47.497
I don't think so, no.

21:02.262 --> 21:03.639
Did you really need all this, Lynn?

21:03.722 --> 21:06.141
What do you think I'm gonna do,
jump out the window?

21:06.225 --> 21:07.559
It's simply protocol.

21:07.851 --> 21:09.811
-Are you firing me?
-Nobody's getting fired.

21:09.895 --> 21:12.231
You know Reiko Ishida from public affairs.

21:12.314 --> 21:13.524
Mr. Barber.

21:13.607 --> 21:14.691
Have a seat, Andy.

21:27.412 --> 21:30.082
We have some bad news on the Rifkin case.

21:31.041 --> 21:34.086
The print we lifted
from the victim's sweatshirt...

21:35.879 --> 21:37.297
it's from your son.

21:38.006 --> 21:39.007
Wait. What?

21:39.716 --> 21:42.386
It's a match for his right forefinger.

21:45.722 --> 21:48.058
From the angle,
they think maybe he reached over

21:48.141 --> 21:50.018
and grabbed the victim by his sweatshirt,

21:50.102 --> 21:51.270
leaving a print on the tag.

21:51.353 --> 21:53.730
-There's got to be an explanation.
-I'm sure there is.

21:53.814 --> 21:55.691
They go to the same school.
Jacob's in his class.

21:55.774 --> 21:56.775
Yes, we know that.

21:56.859 --> 21:58.902
-This doesn't mean anything.
-We know, Andy.

22:03.323 --> 22:04.658
Have you arrested him?

22:05.284 --> 22:07.536
-Lynn, have you arrested my son?
-Not yet, no.

22:07.995 --> 22:09.079
But you're going to?

22:09.162 --> 22:10.706
We have no choice given the circumstances.

22:10.789 --> 22:13.041
-Do you have a warrant?
-We are getting it now.

22:13.125 --> 22:15.419
Lynn, I give you my word,
he'll turn himself in.

22:15.502 --> 22:16.712
You don't have to arrest him.

22:16.795 --> 22:18.630
He doesn't belong in jail.
Not even for one night.

22:18.714 --> 22:21.466
He's not a flight risk. He's my son.

22:22.134 --> 22:23.844
Please, don't arrest him.

22:23.927 --> 22:24.970
-Andy...
-Please!

22:25.053 --> 22:27.014
It's not even a close call. You know that.

22:27.097 --> 22:29.474
Why?
Because of a fingerprint? One fingerprint?

22:29.558 --> 22:31.310
You need to get a lawyer for Jacob.

22:36.315 --> 22:38.358
You're ruining his life, do you know that?

22:38.734 --> 22:40.027
You're gonna destroy it.

22:43.488 --> 22:45.657
I'm following the evidence. That's my job.

22:46.158 --> 22:48.660
Look, I have to view him
as I would any other suspect

22:48.744 --> 22:50.746
or it will reek of preferential treatment.

22:51.872 --> 22:53.832
This decision has been made, Andy.

22:53.916 --> 22:56.543
Wait, wait, wait. What about Leonard Patz?

22:56.627 --> 22:59.254
We just started looking into him.
Talk to Pam Duffy. She can explain.

22:59.338 --> 23:00.631
We did.

23:00.714 --> 23:02.841
There is more going on here
than you're aware of.

23:02.925 --> 23:04.426
More than what? A fingerprint?

23:04.510 --> 23:06.053
Tell me, goddamn it!

23:09.014 --> 23:11.850
Sorry. Hey. That was--

23:15.312 --> 23:18.857
I'm asking you as a favor
to me and my family. Please don't do this.

23:18.941 --> 23:21.109
We're putting you on paid leave,
effective immediately.

23:21.193 --> 23:22.903
What am I supposed to tell Laurie?

23:23.487 --> 23:24.780
Andy, I'm sorry.

23:27.407 --> 23:28.534
I'm begging you.

23:31.537 --> 23:33.288
Look, I need you to listen to me.

23:33.872 --> 23:37.960
We all care about you. I care very much.

23:38.335 --> 23:40.420
Whatever it is your son may have done,

23:40.504 --> 23:43.131
I'm here to help you navigate that,
all right?

23:48.762 --> 23:49.763
Andy?

23:51.390 --> 23:52.391
Andy?

23:56.812 --> 23:57.980
Who gets this case?

23:59.815 --> 24:00.816
Neal.

24:06.697 --> 24:07.781
Are we done here?

24:16.373 --> 24:18.333
Jacob, it's Dad.
I need to know where you are.

24:18.417 --> 24:20.002
Call me as soon as you get this.

24:20.085 --> 24:22.254
Green light. Red light.

24:23.881 --> 24:25.340
You go back. You go back.

24:33.432 --> 24:36.351
Come on, Laurie.
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

24:36.435 --> 24:38.228
Green light. Red light.

24:46.403 --> 24:48.363
Come on, Laurie. Pick up the phone.

24:48.447 --> 24:49.865
Hi. You've reached Laurie Barber.

24:49.948 --> 24:51.450
Goddamn it.

24:52.492 --> 24:55.746
Green light. Red light. You all got me!

24:56.872 --> 24:58.207
Okay. Go back. Go back.

25:01.126 --> 25:02.127
Oh, okay.

25:02.961 --> 25:04.254
Would you take over?

25:10.636 --> 25:12.596
-Laurie.
-What's wrong? Is Jacob okay?

25:12.679 --> 25:14.431
He's fine.
I just need you to come home right now.

25:14.515 --> 25:15.974
I can explain everything
when you get there.

25:16.058 --> 25:17.059
No, tell me now.

25:17.142 --> 25:18.143
Just please come home.

25:18.227 --> 25:20.938
Duffy's on her way there
and she has a search warrant.

25:21.021 --> 25:23.649
-I just want to try and get there before--
-A search warrant?

25:24.691 --> 25:26.818
Oh, my God.
This is about the knife, isn't it?

25:26.902 --> 25:31.281
No. That-- Just come home right now.
I can explain everything. I promise.

25:31.365 --> 25:32.199
Okay.

25:33.617 --> 25:34.618
Oh, my God.

25:53.053 --> 25:54.137
Mr. Barber!

25:54.847 --> 25:57.432
Sir! You know the house is frozen.

25:57.516 --> 25:59.852
You got a warrant yet?
Yeah, I didn't think so.

25:59.935 --> 26:02.020
It's my house.
I have a right to go inside.

26:03.313 --> 26:04.398
Andy!

26:16.034 --> 26:17.286
I'm really sorry, Andy.

26:18.245 --> 26:19.329
Is Jacob here?

26:22.207 --> 26:23.292
I don't think so.

26:24.168 --> 26:25.586
Any idea where he would be?

26:27.713 --> 26:29.047
Have you tried his phone?

26:29.131 --> 26:32.009
He must have turned it off.
You probably know that by now.

26:35.429 --> 26:38.182
Listen, I'm gonna need you
to wait outside. You know the drill.

26:47.441 --> 26:51.153
Don't fuck this up, Pam.
I mean it. Do your job.

26:51.653 --> 26:52.654
I won't.

27:06.376 --> 27:07.377
Sir.

28:12.025 --> 28:13.610
What is happening? Where's Jake?

29:14.046 --> 29:15.380
I don't know who else to call.

29:15.464 --> 29:17.799
He'll turn up. I'm sure he's just scared.

29:34.024 --> 29:35.025
I threw it away.

29:37.486 --> 29:39.154
The knife. His knife.

29:40.239 --> 29:42.908
What? Why would you do that?

29:43.408 --> 29:45.160
You wanted to keep it in the house?

29:46.620 --> 29:50.791
Oh, my God. You knew this would happen,
didn't you? That Jacob was a suspect.

29:50.874 --> 29:53.001
No. No, I was as blindsided as you were.

29:53.085 --> 29:55.838
I just wanted it out of the house.
I didn't know any of this would happen.

30:01.677 --> 30:03.178
Okay. I think we're all done.

30:04.888 --> 30:05.889
Laurie.

30:07.099 --> 30:08.183
Any word from Jacob?

30:08.851 --> 30:09.935
We've called everyone.

30:11.144 --> 30:12.855
We have state and local looking for him.

30:12.938 --> 30:14.314
He must be hiding.

30:14.898 --> 30:16.108
Do you know that for certain?

30:16.191 --> 30:20.612
No. I guess he just saw
the police outside and got scared.

30:21.238 --> 30:23.240
Why would he assume
that they were here for him?

30:23.323 --> 30:25.117
We're not answering
any more questions tonight,

30:25.200 --> 30:28.370
and that includes Jacob when he shows up.
I don't want anyone grilling him.

30:28.453 --> 30:30.247
He's a minor,
he has a right to a parent present.

30:30.330 --> 30:31.373
So don't try to pull anything.

30:31.456 --> 30:33.542
Jeez, Andy, nobody's gonna
do anything without you there.

30:33.625 --> 30:36.044
I know. I know. Just... don't.

30:36.962 --> 30:38.088
It could help him.

30:38.839 --> 30:41.049
Come on. Who are you talking to?

30:45.387 --> 30:47.055
I really am sorry about all this.

30:48.265 --> 30:49.349
I know you are.

30:50.100 --> 30:52.144
Okay, well, I'm gonna go wait out front.

30:55.731 --> 30:58.400
Just so you know,
they may have found the knife.

31:00.611 --> 31:01.695
Really? Where?

31:01.778 --> 31:03.197
Not sure. I just found out.

31:08.243 --> 31:09.453
He didn't do this, Pam.

31:10.829 --> 31:12.581
I know you and I aren't
gonna talk much after this,

31:12.664 --> 31:14.583
so I just wanted you to hear it from me.

31:15.083 --> 31:16.877
He didn't do this.

31:19.296 --> 31:20.631
I'll keep you informed.

32:50.804 --> 32:52.764
A lot of people are looking for you,
you know.

32:56.101 --> 32:57.186
I didn't do it.

32:57.519 --> 32:58.854
Do what?

33:02.274 --> 33:03.442
Kill him.

33:04.902 --> 33:05.903
I didn't--

33:11.533 --> 33:12.659
I just found him.

33:18.749 --> 33:21.168
He was just lying there
on the ground and...

33:23.253 --> 33:27.925
I thought maybe he was hurt or something,
so I went to help-- to pick him up.

33:29.092 --> 33:34.181
Then... I saw the blood on him
and I saw that his eyes were open,

33:34.848 --> 33:36.517
and I knew that he was dead.

33:39.603 --> 33:41.772
So I got scared and I ran.

33:42.940 --> 33:44.441
Did you tell anyone?

33:48.445 --> 33:49.446
Why not?

33:53.450 --> 33:57.204
Okay. Well, I'm gonna take you down
to the police station now.

33:59.039 --> 34:00.123
I want my dad.

34:03.460 --> 34:05.128
Please, I really want my dad.

34:26.315 --> 34:27.400
What are you thinking?

34:28.652 --> 34:29.652
Nothing.

34:29.735 --> 34:30.737
Don't.

34:32.030 --> 34:33.866
Don't you dare shut me out. Not now.

34:34.324 --> 34:36.451
Whatever worst-case scenarios
you're considering,

34:36.534 --> 34:38.120
I need to know
what we're dealing with here.

34:38.203 --> 34:40.038
I don't know what we're dealing with yet.

34:44.208 --> 34:45.710
I'm just thinking about Jacob.

35:32.049 --> 35:33.342
Oh, my God.

35:40.516 --> 35:41.892
Are you all right?

35:42.476 --> 35:43.685
Hey.

35:46.355 --> 35:47.898
They really think I killed Ben.

35:47.981 --> 35:50.692
It's a mistake.
We're gonna figure it out. Don't worry.

35:51.151 --> 35:52.569
How is this even happening?

35:53.028 --> 35:55.697
I don't know. I don't know,
but we're gonna clear it up.

35:57.032 --> 35:59.409
Sweetheart, we know you're scared.
We all are.

35:59.743 --> 36:00.953
They said I can't go home.

36:01.662 --> 36:04.540
No, not tonight. But there's gonna be
an arraignment first thing in the morning.

36:06.291 --> 36:09.002
-I don't even know what that is.
-It's just a proceeding.

36:09.086 --> 36:11.129
They're gonna read the charge,
they're gonna set the bail,

36:11.213 --> 36:12.798
then we'll take you right home.

36:13.215 --> 36:14.216
Are you sure?

36:14.591 --> 36:17.886
Absolutely. You'll be home by dinner.
I give you my word.

36:22.015 --> 36:23.016
How much is bail?

36:24.226 --> 36:25.978
I don't know.
We'll find that out tomorrow.

36:27.187 --> 36:29.189
What if we can't afford it?
What happens to me then?

36:29.273 --> 36:32.109
-We'll find the money. It's okay.
-We have savings. The house--

36:32.192 --> 36:35.404
-Yeah, but what if--
-Hey. Hey, let us worry about that. Okay?

36:45.664 --> 36:50.002
I'm so-- I'm so sorry.
I didn't-- I didn't do it.

36:50.085 --> 36:51.879
I swear. I didn't do it.

36:52.421 --> 36:53.463
We believe you.

37:00.429 --> 37:01.430
I'm not--

37:01.513 --> 37:06.185
I know I'm not, like, the perfect kid
or anything, but I didn't do it.

37:06.268 --> 37:07.686
You are perfect, sweetheart.

37:07.769 --> 37:10.689
I didn't even know Ben.
He was just, like, this kid from school.

37:10.772 --> 37:13.358
Why would I kill him? Why?
Why would they think that?

37:15.444 --> 37:17.487
Is it because of what Derek said?

37:18.363 --> 37:21.116
-I don't know.
-What do you mean? This is your case.

37:29.499 --> 37:32.961
Jake, did you tell the arresting officer
that you found Ben's body?

37:33.837 --> 37:34.838
Is that true?

37:34.922 --> 37:37.966
And you didn't tell us?
Honey, how could you not tell us that?

37:39.635 --> 37:40.928
I didn't tell anybody.

37:43.096 --> 37:44.765
I thought, you know...

37:46.850 --> 37:48.185
that I'd get blamed for it.

37:49.728 --> 37:52.231
I know that was really dumb of me.

37:54.942 --> 37:56.944
I know that. I wish I had. I just--

38:01.990 --> 38:03.742
I got scared and now...

38:07.329 --> 38:09.456
Mom, please don't cry.

38:12.251 --> 38:15.379
Jake, I need you
to listen to me very carefully, okay?

38:15.838 --> 38:18.924
Don't say anything
to anybody else about this.

38:19.508 --> 38:22.094
Do you understand what I'm saying?
That's very important.

38:22.177 --> 38:23.887
-Yes.
-I mean it. Not one word.

38:23.971 --> 38:26.890
When we get home, we can talk about
all of this, but until then, you don't--

38:30.769 --> 38:33.063
You're leaving?
They're not gonna let you stay?

38:33.146 --> 38:35.357
We're gonna meet you at
the courthouse first thing in the morning.

38:35.440 --> 38:37.734
-We'll have a lawyer. We'll have--
-Why can't you be my lawyer?

38:38.443 --> 38:39.736
No, I can't.

38:39.820 --> 38:41.321
Why not? I want you.

38:41.405 --> 38:43.824
I can't for a number of reasons.
It's a bad idea.

38:50.914 --> 38:52.291
Okay.

38:53.375 --> 38:54.376
I--

39:00.674 --> 39:04.595
We love you so much. You know that?
You know how much we love you?

39:04.678 --> 39:05.929
I know.

39:06.597 --> 39:08.015
Be strong, okay, buddy?

39:30.579 --> 39:34.208
Hi, guys. So I know
I haven't posted in a while, but...

39:35.709 --> 39:38.212
It's been a rough time lately,
and I just--

39:39.338 --> 39:40.964
I guess I was in the mood, so--

39:41.465 --> 39:43.509
This is a song my dad used to sing to me.

39:43.592 --> 39:47.262
It's been in my head today, so--
Feel free to comment if you like it.

39:47.346 --> 39:49.223
Or don't. Or whatever.

39:59.775 --> 40:02.194
Everything is cool

40:03.987 --> 40:05.948
Everything's okay

40:07.991 --> 40:10.619
But just before last Christmas

40:11.912 --> 40:13.705
My baby went away

40:16.041 --> 40:18.627
Across the sea to an island

40:18.710 --> 40:19.837
We have made an arrest.

40:20.254 --> 40:21.505
While the bridges brightly burn

40:21.588 --> 40:25.926
We believe the person responsible for
Ben's death is his classmate Jacob Barber.

40:26.009 --> 40:30.931
So far away from my land
The valley of the unconcerned

40:32.975 --> 40:35.894
I was walking down the road, man

40:36.270 --> 40:38.772
Hello. What?

40:38.856 --> 40:40.148
Just staring at my shoes

40:41.650 --> 40:48.031
When God sent me an angel
Just to chase away my blues

40:49.700 --> 40:52.995
Saw a hundred thousand blackbirds

40:54.288 --> 40:56.915
Just flying through the sky

40:58.417 --> 41:01.503
And they seemed to form a teardrop

41:02.671 --> 41:04.882
From a black-haired angel's eye

41:06.592 --> 41:09.553
That tear fell all around me

41:11.054 --> 41:13.473
And it washed my sins away

41:15.434 --> 41:21.565
Now everything is cool
Everything's okay

41:23.692 --> 41:26.278
Now everything is cool

41:27.905 --> 41:29.656
Everything's--

41:59.603 --> 42:00.604
Laurie.

42:03.232 --> 42:04.233
What?

42:11.114 --> 42:12.115
What?

42:18.664 --> 42:19.665
Nothing.

42:21.041 --> 42:22.835
I'm sorry. My head's all over the place.

42:26.421 --> 42:28.006
We should try and get some sleep.

42:57.286 --> 42:58.579
Get you anything else?

42:59.621 --> 43:00.831
I'm okay. Thank you.

43:03.625 --> 43:05.961
Just so you know, we're closing soon.
