WEBVTT

00:03.046 --> 00:06.383
<i>You are my sunshine</i>

00:07.217 --> 00:10.679
<i>My only sunshine</i>

00:12.263 --> 00:15.433
<i>You make me happy</i>

00:15.975 --> 00:17.018
Mama?

00:17.102 --> 00:19.479
<i>When skies are gray</i>

00:20.730 --> 00:22.357
<i>You'll never know, dear...</i>

00:22.440 --> 00:24.067
Mama? Is that you?

00:25.652 --> 00:27.112
Abigail.

00:29.280 --> 00:31.116
Demons.

00:33.576 --> 00:34.786
Crane.

00:36.371 --> 00:37.831
I told you to stay home.

00:38.081 --> 00:39.874
I'm fine, Lieutenant.

00:40.625 --> 00:42.794
I fought at Saratoga
with dysentery.

00:43.044 --> 00:45.964
I can certainly muddle
through this affliction.

00:47.132 --> 00:48.800
If you don't rest,
the body gives out.

00:48.883 --> 00:51.594
So, what you're gonna do
is take plenty of fluids,

00:51.678 --> 00:54.597
the medication
that I got for you,
and go to sleep.

01:04.357 --> 01:06.192
Also, maybe,
a bag of leeches.

01:06.818 --> 01:08.486
Mock if you will,

01:09.237 --> 01:11.948
but I am not the only
one combating fatigue.

01:12.657 --> 01:15.785
A midday nap is rather
unlike you, Lieutenant.

01:15.869 --> 01:18.705
I was up all night
researching, but
thank you for the wake-up.

01:18.997 --> 01:20.290
Is that all?

01:22.083 --> 01:24.169
You seemed
rather startled.

01:24.669 --> 01:26.212
Yeah, I was having
a pretty weird dream.

01:26.713 --> 01:30.175
I was back in Purgatory,
on the run from Moloch.

01:30.925 --> 01:33.428
And somehow,
for whatever reason,
I ended up in these ruins,

01:33.511 --> 01:34.637
and there was my mother.

01:35.180 --> 01:36.765
And she's singing this song
she used to sing

01:36.848 --> 01:38.767
to Jenny and me
when we were kids.

01:40.477 --> 01:42.228
And then she warned me
about demons.

01:42.479 --> 01:44.355
Which we now know
to be true.

01:44.522 --> 01:46.024
According to your
mother's letters,

01:46.608 --> 01:50.653
Moloch sent his
emissaries to torment her
prior to her death.

01:50.820 --> 01:52.322
Explains why she
went off the deep end,

01:52.405 --> 01:56.659
but not why I've been
dreaming about her
every night this week.

01:57.202 --> 01:58.787
No, Lieutenant,
I really don't need...

01:58.870 --> 02:00.914
Hmm.

02:01.873 --> 02:03.041
Mills.

02:05.835 --> 02:06.920
I'll be there.

02:07.879 --> 02:09.714
That was Reyes.
Precinct calls.

02:09.964 --> 02:11.549
I'll come with you.
Mmm-mmm.

02:12.258 --> 02:13.885
You're not going anywhere.

02:15.845 --> 02:17.305
It's quiet time now.

02:19.682 --> 02:22.811
When I'm rested,
there shall be hell to pay.

02:26.689 --> 02:30.276
So, you got three deaths
in three nights,
all by suicide,

02:31.694 --> 02:33.363
all at
Tarrytown Psychiatric.

02:33.446 --> 02:35.114
Coroner's full report
is still pending.

02:35.198 --> 02:36.658
Typically, Tarrytown
has no more than

02:36.741 --> 02:38.660
one or two
suicides a year.

02:38.743 --> 02:39.953
What does
the hospital staff say?

02:40.036 --> 02:41.246
They're the ones
calling us in.

02:41.412 --> 02:42.956
If someone over
there is interfering
with sick people,

02:43.039 --> 02:44.207
I want them found out.

02:44.290 --> 02:46.334
Ma'am, you know what
I'm gonna ask you.

02:47.001 --> 02:48.586
Why give this one to you?

02:49.087 --> 02:50.964
You helped bring down
a satanic cult, Mills,

02:51.172 --> 02:53.091
which proves to me
I can trust your instincts.

02:53.216 --> 02:54.592
You also knew my mother...

02:55.426 --> 02:57.053
That she killed herself
in that hospital.

02:57.136 --> 02:59.597
I choose to see
your connection to this
as personal motivation

02:59.764 --> 03:01.432
to find out what's
behind the suicides.

03:02.559 --> 03:05.854
And we both know,
if I had handed
this to someone else,

03:05.937 --> 03:07.564
you wouldn't have given me
a moment's peace.

03:09.607 --> 03:12.026
So, you're giving me
full control of this
investigation?

03:12.610 --> 03:15.280
Whatever it takes.
Just get it done.

03:25.164 --> 03:26.666
You don't
have to come, Jenny.

03:27.292 --> 03:29.544
Like you said, nobody
knows Tarrytown Psych
better than me.

03:30.169 --> 03:31.880
I know it's a tough ask,

03:31.963 --> 03:34.173
but you know
the conditions that
these victims were facing.

03:34.257 --> 03:35.633
I need that
kind of insight.

03:36.009 --> 03:38.845
Look, just be careful
exactly what you're
looking for.

03:38.970 --> 03:40.597
This place is full of
so much pain.

03:40.930 --> 03:42.807
Most of it the kind
that can't be cured.

03:47.145 --> 03:49.606
Looks like we have
a greeting party.

03:50.607 --> 03:51.774
Hello there.

03:52.191 --> 03:54.152
There you are, Walter.

03:54.485 --> 03:56.029
Let me get you
back to your room.

03:56.988 --> 03:59.073
Lieutenant Mills,
isn't it?

03:59.657 --> 04:01.993
With everything
that's happened,
we're so glad you're here.

04:02.160 --> 04:03.244
Thank you, ma'am.

04:03.328 --> 04:06.164
I thought we'd start
by visiting Captain Irving.

04:06.289 --> 04:09.125
Oh, of course.
Frank will be so
happy to see you.

04:09.709 --> 04:11.336
All right, young man,
let's go.

04:18.092 --> 04:19.260
You be okay?

04:21.054 --> 04:22.931
Yeah.
Home, sweet home.

04:25.016 --> 04:26.643
<i>Nelson, the first suicide.</i>

04:26.726 --> 04:28.061
I knew him
from group therapy.

04:28.478 --> 04:31.230
Used to sell aluminum siding
up in Rochester.

04:31.773 --> 04:34.859
Comes home one day,
beats his neighbor
half to death with a bat.

04:35.276 --> 04:36.402
Hmm.

04:36.486 --> 04:38.863
Turns out he'd been
fighting paranoid
delusions for years.

04:38.947 --> 04:42.408
Could these delusions
have overwhelmed him
enough to commit suicide?

04:43.034 --> 04:45.161
Nelson had major
breakthroughs in group.

04:45.954 --> 04:47.205
Stayed on his meds.

04:48.998 --> 04:50.208
Maybe he relapsed.

04:51.501 --> 04:52.835
I've seen it happen before.

04:53.211 --> 04:56.547
People are doing well,
then something
triggers a backslide.

04:57.215 --> 04:58.257
They fall apart.

04:58.341 --> 04:59.634
He'd found God.

04:59.801 --> 05:01.260
Organized the hospital
prayer group.

05:01.344 --> 05:02.428
Just doesn't track for me.

05:02.595 --> 05:04.597
None of these suicides
seem motivated.

05:08.393 --> 05:09.769
Sir, I have to ask.

05:11.729 --> 05:13.272
Did I have anything
to do with this?

05:14.857 --> 05:16.067
No.

05:16.442 --> 05:17.860
But I don't
blame you for asking.

05:19.237 --> 05:21.864
<i>I can tell you</i>
<i>how to reclaim your soul,</i>
Ow!

05:22.573 --> 05:23.741
<i>but you won't like it.</i>

05:24.283 --> 05:26.202
Try me.
You must take a life.

05:26.828 --> 05:28.579
A soul for a soul.

05:29.038 --> 05:31.916
My soul belongs to
the Horseman of War,
but for now

05:32.750 --> 05:34.794
I am still in control
of my actions.

05:36.587 --> 05:38.673
Even chose
my own color Jell-O
at breakfast this morning.

05:38.756 --> 05:40.216
It's a good sign.

05:41.551 --> 05:44.762
I did this to
protect my daughter,

05:45.263 --> 05:47.557
and I'd make
the same choice again,
if I had to.

05:47.765 --> 05:48.891
We're gonna
get you out of here.

05:49.183 --> 05:51.936
We'll find a way to
undo whatever Henry
did to your soul.

05:52.603 --> 05:56.274
But for now,
Captain, from inside,
maybe you can help us?

06:02.947 --> 06:04.449
Let's start with
the video from
the first death.

06:04.532 --> 06:05.950
Nelson Greave,
four nights ago.

06:06.576 --> 06:08.453
Surveillance data is all
in the hospital mainframe.

06:08.619 --> 06:09.996
It'll just take
a minute to upload.

06:11.748 --> 06:14.000
Man, there was nowhere
we could go in here
without being watched.

06:14.083 --> 06:15.793
I can't imagine
what it was like for you.

06:16.627 --> 06:18.546
You learn to deal
with the abuse,

06:18.629 --> 06:21.257
and being
surrounded by misery.

06:21.674 --> 06:23.968
In her own way,
Mom prepared me for that.

06:24.510 --> 06:25.636
How?

06:26.554 --> 06:29.891
I came here once,
before I was a patient.

06:30.516 --> 06:32.727
When we were living
in the group home,

06:32.810 --> 06:34.896
and you had to stay late
at school one day.

06:35.063 --> 06:36.189
You tried to see her?

06:36.272 --> 06:37.356
Yeah, I managed
to sneak in.

06:38.274 --> 06:40.359
I just wanted to have
a moment with her,
you know?

06:40.818 --> 06:42.111
A real moment

06:43.196 --> 06:44.989
with the person
who I thought could

06:45.865 --> 06:47.492
save us from foster hell.

06:49.285 --> 06:50.495
But instead,

06:51.162 --> 06:53.247
my last memory of her was

06:54.165 --> 06:55.917
<i>orderlies</i>
<i>dragging her away.</i>

06:56.667 --> 06:58.002
Let me go!

06:58.419 --> 06:59.545
Mom!

07:00.254 --> 07:01.631
Jenny, get out!

07:06.052 --> 07:07.512
Get out of here!

07:09.931 --> 07:11.349
Abbie, let me
ask you something.

07:12.475 --> 07:14.018
What exactly are you
trying to find here?

07:14.685 --> 07:17.522
This case is not
going to change
what happened to Mom.

07:19.690 --> 07:21.734
After Mom was committed,

07:23.027 --> 07:26.072
all I thought about was
how I'd end up crazy like her,

07:27.698 --> 07:29.408
place like this.

07:31.160 --> 07:34.622
Then you were sent here,
I knew I was next.

07:35.748 --> 07:38.376
It's tainted everything
I've done since,

07:38.960 --> 07:40.711
but now knowing

07:41.712 --> 07:43.214
what she was facing,

07:45.842 --> 07:49.137
I just want to try to
at least understand why.

07:50.555 --> 07:52.014
Why am I a Witness?

07:52.181 --> 07:54.142
Why was I chosen for this?

08:00.148 --> 08:01.440
Yeah, okay.

08:02.817 --> 08:04.110
Okay.

08:05.736 --> 08:06.904
Found it.

08:08.739 --> 08:10.741
Nelson's room,
the night of his death.

08:20.001 --> 08:21.043
Oh, my God.

08:23.921 --> 08:25.256
There's something
in the corner.

08:26.048 --> 08:27.758
Let's try
the night-vision overlay.

08:29.260 --> 08:30.928
Let me get a closer look.

08:35.141 --> 08:36.142
Oh, my God.

08:36.601 --> 08:37.685
That's Mom.

08:38.895 --> 08:40.521
Back from the grave.

09:15.890 --> 09:17.308
Are you certain
it was her?

09:17.516 --> 09:20.436
Jenny took the video
to be analyzed by
an imaging expert.

09:21.020 --> 09:22.605
But I know.

09:23.272 --> 09:24.732
It's definitely Mom.

09:27.151 --> 09:29.445
This eucalyptus treatment
is having no effect.

09:30.488 --> 09:32.073
Oh, please.

09:32.865 --> 09:34.116
It's torturous.

09:35.076 --> 09:36.869
Electroconvulsive therapy.

09:36.953 --> 09:38.871
Lithium,
antidepressants.

09:39.664 --> 09:41.123
They tried everything
to calm her down.

09:41.249 --> 09:42.500
Nothing worked.

09:42.708 --> 09:45.419
Well, those medications
are for delusions.

09:45.962 --> 09:47.255
Her demons were real.

09:49.799 --> 09:51.676
I've been going back over
my last memories with her,

09:52.802 --> 09:54.512
seeing if she
ever said anything

09:54.595 --> 09:56.639
that could shed light
on Moloch, or...

09:59.600 --> 10:01.769
I was just a kid.
At the time,
she seemed crazy.

10:04.939 --> 10:06.107
Mama, we're home.

10:06.315 --> 10:07.858
<i>She wasn't full-time</i>
<i>at the hospital yet,</i>

10:08.025 --> 10:10.111
<i>just getting treatment</i>
<i>as an outpatient.</i>

10:10.236 --> 10:12.196
Don't forget to
lock that door.
Okay.

10:14.490 --> 10:17.034
<i>But you never knew</i>
<i>what version of her</i>
<i>you would get.</i>

10:18.369 --> 10:19.912
- You lock the door?
- Yes, ma'am.

10:20.037 --> 10:22.123
Mama,
how you feeling today?

10:22.206 --> 10:25.626
You took the bus.
No buses! No shortcuts!

10:25.835 --> 10:28.421
Just the route I
showed you right
through town, you hear?

10:28.546 --> 10:30.548
We just wanted to
talk to some friends.

10:30.631 --> 10:32.508
How many times do
I have to tell you?

10:32.717 --> 10:34.760
They may even be
your so-called friends.

10:35.428 --> 10:36.846
These demons
have no mercy.

10:37.388 --> 10:41.183
They'll use any
possible way to hurt you,
to take you from me!

10:42.226 --> 10:45.563
The only defense we have
is to think like them.

10:50.109 --> 10:51.569
But it's all right now.

10:52.486 --> 10:54.739
Come here.
Come here, come on.

10:54.947 --> 10:56.240
Come here.

10:57.616 --> 10:59.076
Remember what
Mama told you?

10:59.702 --> 11:03.581
Eyes open, head up,
trust no one.

11:11.088 --> 11:13.257
That's right.
That's right.

11:15.092 --> 11:17.136
I am sorry, Lieutenant.

11:18.220 --> 11:20.639
Clearly,
she meant to protect you.

11:21.682 --> 11:23.934
It is possible

11:24.643 --> 11:28.856
that if demons tormented her
into taking her own life,

11:28.981 --> 11:31.776
perhaps somehow they've
brought her back now

11:31.859 --> 11:34.153
to force others at Tarrytown
down the same road.

11:34.320 --> 11:35.946
She died 15 years ago.

11:36.322 --> 11:38.449
Why come back now?
Uh...

11:44.830 --> 11:45.831
Oh.

11:46.290 --> 11:47.958
She's killing these people.

11:48.918 --> 11:51.253
Forcing them into
the same death she chose.

11:51.837 --> 11:53.798
The doctor has arrived.

11:54.965 --> 11:58.302
As ordered,
maps and books
from your cabin,

11:58.427 --> 12:01.263
plus a little dose of
cure from the local deli.

12:01.347 --> 12:02.515
Hey.

12:02.598 --> 12:04.392
You called Hawley for help.

12:04.475 --> 12:06.394
You needed sleep
and I'm working the case.

12:06.852 --> 12:08.813
I am more than
capable of retrieving

12:08.938 --> 12:11.065
whatever materials
this investigation requires.

12:14.193 --> 12:15.486
Well, then, tell me,

12:15.653 --> 12:18.697
what was the cost of
this favor, privateer?

12:18.906 --> 12:20.116
What on Earth is this?

12:20.574 --> 12:21.909
If you could
smell right now,

12:22.034 --> 12:24.078
you'd be inhaling one of
God's greatest creations.

12:24.328 --> 12:25.579
Matzo ball soup.

12:26.288 --> 12:28.499
Well, I'll invoice you.

12:32.336 --> 12:33.337
Oh!

12:35.798 --> 12:36.966
That is

12:39.885 --> 12:41.220
somewhat comforting.

12:42.263 --> 12:43.806
But as I was saying,

12:45.015 --> 12:49.228
I have an inkling
as to why your mother
has risen at this moment.

12:53.065 --> 12:55.526
My copy of Washington's
original map of the region.

12:56.527 --> 13:00.114
Tarrytown Hospital
is built on
a specific ley line

13:00.281 --> 13:03.701
that points of
convergence between us
and the spirit world.

13:03.993 --> 13:05.327
And now with
Moloch here on Earth...

13:05.578 --> 13:08.497
He may have conjured her
to prey upon our resolve.

13:08.581 --> 13:11.125
Which also means that
Katrina hasn't been
able to kill Moloch.

13:11.208 --> 13:13.544
Well, it was no
easy assignment
she took on.

13:13.836 --> 13:16.213
Assassinating
a newly-born demon
of the Apocalypse.

13:16.338 --> 13:17.506
I just meant that
we haven't heard from her.

13:17.590 --> 13:19.300
What do you suggest,
Lieutenant?
That we seek her out?

13:19.383 --> 13:20.926
Expose her as
a spy to our enemies?

13:21.051 --> 13:23.846
No, no, truly,
what is your alternative?

13:25.181 --> 13:26.307
No.

13:27.308 --> 13:28.726
He'll be fine
after he sleeps.

13:29.351 --> 13:30.644
I'm coming with you
back to Tarrytown.

13:31.020 --> 13:32.188
Mmm-mmm.

13:33.856 --> 13:37.026
Look, um, I heard
about what you found
on that video.

13:38.235 --> 13:39.445
I got to get back.

13:39.528 --> 13:41.780
Yeah, I'm just...
You know, with
Mr. Woodhouse here

13:41.906 --> 13:43.199
down for a round,
I thought...

13:43.282 --> 13:44.408
Mr. Woodhouse?

13:44.783 --> 13:46.660
I didn't realize you
were a Jane Austen fan.

13:46.744 --> 13:48.913
Nor would I have
pegged you for one, either.

13:48.996 --> 13:51.499
I'm just saying, I'm...
You know,
I'm happy to chip in.

13:51.582 --> 13:53.751
Is that because you know
that Moloch's still alive,

13:55.085 --> 13:57.254
and you might need us
if there really
is an Apocalypse?

13:57.546 --> 14:01.592
Before I answer that,
just remember,
you called me first.

14:05.763 --> 14:07.139
What did you
put in his soup?

14:07.431 --> 14:09.934
Well, you asked me
to bring him something
to help him sleep.

14:12.478 --> 14:14.104
You're welcome.

14:21.779 --> 14:24.448
A little more than kin,
and less than kind.

14:25.616 --> 14:28.327
The words of a son
longing for affection.

14:29.828 --> 14:32.414
Whatever it is
you want from me,
I will not cooperate.

14:34.875 --> 14:36.418
Who exactly
is this child?

14:36.710 --> 14:38.087
An orphan.

14:40.381 --> 14:41.715
As I was for a time.

14:41.799 --> 14:44.134
You bring this foundling
here for what reason?

14:44.718 --> 14:45.886
To torment me?

14:45.970 --> 14:48.597
The presence of
a needy child upsets you?

14:49.807 --> 14:51.433
My, how telling.

14:52.059 --> 14:53.852
That is not
what I meant. I...

14:56.480 --> 14:59.358
I simply want to know
the plan you have
for the child.

15:00.818 --> 15:03.904
For this one,
I wish only great things.

15:05.197 --> 15:06.323
Come.

15:07.116 --> 15:08.617
Pick him up, Mother.

15:12.413 --> 15:13.664
I don't wish to
disturb him.

15:13.747 --> 15:14.957
Nonsense.

15:15.499 --> 15:17.167
All children need nurturing.

15:17.793 --> 15:20.004
Particularly those
who have been abandoned.

15:21.005 --> 15:24.800
Your history as
a mother has been,
shall we say, lacking?

15:25.801 --> 15:27.469
Now's your chance
to change that.

15:28.137 --> 15:30.514
Or will you forsake him
as you once did me?

16:10.137 --> 16:14.516
It seems you possess
the maternal instinct
after all.

16:21.732 --> 16:22.900
And for the record,

16:22.983 --> 16:24.818
I think we should have
brought more firepower.

16:25.361 --> 16:27.196
I mean, we are
staking out a killer ghost.

16:27.321 --> 16:28.614
Who also
happens to be our mother.

16:28.739 --> 16:30.699
We need to stop
her from hurting
other people, maybe help her.

16:30.824 --> 16:32.534
This place turned her
into a monster.

16:32.618 --> 16:34.745
We need to send her back
before she kills anyone else.

16:34.828 --> 16:37.206
We don't know the full story.
That's why we're here.

16:37.414 --> 16:39.625
I just want to
put her to rest.

16:39.833 --> 16:42.252
Look, guys, they're not
mutually exclusive, okay?

16:42.753 --> 16:45.923
We can stop her
and maybe help her
find some peace.

16:50.844 --> 16:52.429
Abbie, upper left corner.

16:52.638 --> 16:54.640
It's that patient
we saw this morning.

16:59.770 --> 17:01.271
He's gonna use that glass.

17:01.939 --> 17:03.190
Let's go.

17:08.779 --> 17:10.531
Walt, Walt.
No!

17:11.615 --> 17:12.700
There you go.

17:12.783 --> 17:13.909
No! I need to die!

17:13.992 --> 17:15.077
Hey, hey!

17:16.120 --> 17:17.621
Shh. There you go.

17:21.291 --> 17:23.252
Hey,
it's okay. I got you.

17:25.379 --> 17:26.422
<i>Abbie!</i>

17:28.090 --> 17:29.216
Mama!

17:30.718 --> 17:31.802
Abbie?

17:52.865 --> 17:55.492
Okay, where the hell
did you bring me?

18:32.863 --> 18:34.239
Mama.

18:36.867 --> 18:38.368
Was that you?

18:39.161 --> 18:40.204
It's not safe
for you here.

18:41.705 --> 18:42.873
Lieutenant Mills?
Oh!

18:44.792 --> 18:46.877
It's me, Gina Lambert.
I work here.

18:47.544 --> 18:48.837
I am so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

18:48.921 --> 18:50.130
I thought that
there was someone here.

18:50.255 --> 18:52.299
Oh. I...
I don't think so.

18:53.008 --> 18:54.718
It's this place.
It can,

18:55.886 --> 18:57.846
well, do things to you.

18:58.555 --> 19:00.557
Are you okay?
Yes, thank you.

19:02.643 --> 19:05.395
You...
You don't look okay.

19:06.230 --> 19:07.564
I'm fine.

19:08.398 --> 19:11.944
How did you wind up here?
This wing hasn't
been used in years.

19:12.653 --> 19:13.987
I must've taken
a wrong turn.

19:14.571 --> 19:16.365
I'm gonna, uh,
find my way out.

19:20.285 --> 19:21.411
Abbie?

19:22.079 --> 19:23.121
Oh.

19:23.205 --> 19:24.289
I'll take the south wing.

19:24.373 --> 19:25.374
Okay, great,
I'll take the east.

19:26.041 --> 19:27.125
Mills!

19:30.754 --> 19:32.047
<i>Jennifer.</i>

19:32.172 --> 19:33.423
Mama?

19:34.716 --> 19:35.926
Stay away from me.

19:48.063 --> 19:49.106
Jenny!

19:49.439 --> 19:50.774
Oh, Abbie. Thank God.

19:51.275 --> 19:52.526
You okay?
I'm fine.

19:53.277 --> 19:55.612
What happened?
I think Mama was here.

19:56.238 --> 19:58.448
Did she try to hurt you?
No. But she did this.

20:01.785 --> 20:03.954
"TPRJLM12."

20:05.414 --> 20:07.583
It's an alphanumeric
code used by hospitals

20:07.666 --> 20:09.918
to designate
patient video sessions.

20:10.127 --> 20:11.253
Specifically,
one of Mom's.

20:11.962 --> 20:13.630
I have it back
at the archives.

20:13.714 --> 20:15.799
What? Do you understand
any of this?

20:16.258 --> 20:17.384
Not yet.

20:18.135 --> 20:19.636
But she's trying to
tell us something.

20:20.304 --> 20:21.346
Okay.

20:40.324 --> 20:42.409
No, no, no, no, no, no.

20:59.551 --> 21:01.178
Devil's Breath.

21:17.694 --> 21:18.695
Ah.

21:19.529 --> 21:21.698
I asked Hawley and Crane
to give us some privacy.

21:23.533 --> 21:25.202
This is just for
you and me to see.

21:29.581 --> 21:31.333
Abbie, I don't think
I can watch it.

21:33.210 --> 21:34.586
We need to know
what it means.

21:35.545 --> 21:37.130
Especially after
the note she left.

21:38.924 --> 21:40.342
This note?

21:43.679 --> 21:45.055
It says, "I fought."

21:47.224 --> 21:49.267
I mean, I don't know,
is that how you
remember it, Abbie?

21:50.519 --> 21:52.729
'Cause as much
as I loved Mama,

21:54.064 --> 21:56.733
most of my earliest memories
involve me being scared.

21:56.984 --> 21:59.820
We know the reason
she was unstable.

22:00.737 --> 22:03.490
Maybe this can help us
understand it all more.

22:05.993 --> 22:09.413
I don't know,
but we do this together,

22:10.330 --> 22:11.915
like we used to
when things got bad.

22:14.376 --> 22:15.460
Okay.

22:27.597 --> 22:29.016
<i>How are you</i>
<i>feeling today, Lori?</i>

22:31.768 --> 22:32.978
<i>The demons.</i>

22:36.231 --> 22:38.567
<i>They...</i>
<i>They followed me here.</i>

22:40.902 --> 22:43.030
<i>These demons,</i>
<i>are they the same ones</i>

22:43.113 --> 22:44.448
<i>that came</i>
<i>for your daughters?</i>

22:44.614 --> 22:45.949
<i>I have to protect them.</i>

22:48.827 --> 22:50.537
<i>She said I wasn't</i>
<i>a good mother.</i>

22:51.455 --> 22:53.290
<i>Who said that?</i>
<i>Her.</i>

22:54.291 --> 22:55.876
<i>She wants me to do it.</i>

22:56.877 --> 22:58.295
<i>Who wants you to do it?</i>

22:58.628 --> 22:59.963
<i>Nurse.</i>

23:00.964 --> 23:03.091
<i>The nurse. Lambert.</i>

23:03.675 --> 23:05.802
- Lambert?
<i>- She's right about me.</i>

23:08.972 --> 23:10.057
<i>I need to do it.</i>

23:10.140 --> 23:12.309
The nurse we saw this morning
was named Lambert.

23:12.476 --> 23:14.061
<i>I need to end my pain.</i>

23:14.144 --> 23:16.480
<i>She was with Walt</i>
<i>before he tried</i>
<i>to kill himself.</i>

23:16.605 --> 23:18.565
I just want to
thank you for your help.

23:18.648 --> 23:20.984
<i>Lori,</i>
<i>there is no Nurse Lambert.</i>

23:21.234 --> 23:23.487
<i>She's a delusion you created,</i>
<i>like the demons.</i>

23:23.653 --> 23:24.905
<i>No.</i>

23:25.530 --> 23:26.823
<i>She's real!</i>

23:27.657 --> 23:29.367
Mama isn't behind
those deaths.

23:30.285 --> 23:31.661
Oh, Frank.

23:32.162 --> 23:33.789
I love helping people.

23:34.164 --> 23:38.960
Everybody has so much
hurt bottled up inside.

23:39.461 --> 23:41.463
<i>She's real.</i>

23:41.671 --> 23:42.923
It's that nurse
from this morning.

23:43.465 --> 23:45.842
Of course.
Frank will be so
happy to see you.

23:47.010 --> 23:48.178
She knows Irving.

23:48.678 --> 23:51.973
Trust me.
These will help with the pain.

24:08.365 --> 24:10.158
<i>You have to do it.</i>

24:12.911 --> 24:15.997
<i>You have to...</i>
<i>Have to.</i>

24:16.164 --> 24:17.499
<i>It's time.</i>

24:25.173 --> 24:26.424
<i>It's time.</i>

24:27.551 --> 24:28.885
<i>You have to.</i>

24:36.852 --> 24:38.061
<i>Freedom.</i>

24:39.062 --> 24:40.272
<i>Do it now.</i>

24:44.067 --> 24:45.235
<i>Do it.</i>

24:48.071 --> 24:49.364
<i>Freedom.</i>

24:51.908 --> 24:53.034
Captain!

24:53.577 --> 24:54.786
Captain!

24:55.412 --> 24:57.581
- He tied himself in.
- No!

25:04.254 --> 25:06.423
Get out! I need to die!

25:07.465 --> 25:08.717
Damn.

25:09.759 --> 25:11.303
Why did you save me?

25:37.871 --> 25:39.039
Mills.

25:41.458 --> 25:43.210
How are you feeling, Captain?

25:46.004 --> 25:47.297
I've been better.

25:48.548 --> 25:49.799
You remember what happened?

25:50.008 --> 25:52.385
The nurse. Lambert.

25:52.802 --> 25:54.387
She gave me some pills.

25:55.222 --> 25:58.934
Then everything she
started telling me
about taking my own life,

25:59.017 --> 26:00.310
it just made sense.

26:00.936 --> 26:03.521
And suicide seemed like
the only thing to do.

26:04.481 --> 26:06.233
The tox report shows that

26:06.316 --> 26:08.818
you were under the influence
of psychotropic drugs.

26:09.569 --> 26:11.780
Opened your mind
to suggestion.

26:12.280 --> 26:14.491
Especially with
demonic influence.

26:14.824 --> 26:15.992
Demonic?

26:17.244 --> 26:18.870
Who is she?
I don't know yet.

26:18.954 --> 26:20.497
I've got to figure that out,

26:20.580 --> 26:22.332
but she's someone
we're gonna stop.

26:23.833 --> 26:25.085
I want to help.

26:26.211 --> 26:28.463
But they're gonna think
I'm a suicide risk now.

26:29.256 --> 26:30.423
Just rest.

26:32.092 --> 26:33.343
We got this.

26:35.679 --> 26:36.805
Mills.

26:41.351 --> 26:42.560
Anytime.

26:46.273 --> 26:47.482
<i>Gina Lambert.</i>

26:47.732 --> 26:49.985
Claimed the lives
of 21 patients
across the country

26:50.151 --> 26:53.363
while working as a nurse,
back in the 1950s.

26:53.446 --> 26:55.115
And Lambert fed
patients a cocktail

26:55.198 --> 26:56.992
that included
Sodium Pentothal.

26:57.075 --> 26:58.743
For people on the verge,

26:58.827 --> 27:00.453
it would break down
their emotional defenses

27:00.537 --> 27:02.622
and make them willing
to take their own lives.

27:03.331 --> 27:05.917
Lambert's profile says
she saw all her victims
as mercy kills,

27:06.918 --> 27:09.629
ending their pain
by convincing them
to commit suicide.

27:09.879 --> 27:12.674
They finally caught
Lambert in 1958, here,

27:12.799 --> 27:14.718
when she was working
at Tarrytown Psychiatric.

27:14.926 --> 27:17.095
Sent her to
the electric chair, '59.

27:18.305 --> 27:19.806
That's the woman
we saw this morning.

27:20.056 --> 27:21.182
Another ghost.

27:21.266 --> 27:24.060
I think this is Mom
trying to stop this demon
from killing other people.

27:24.227 --> 27:26.062
Her final note said,
"I fought."

27:26.271 --> 27:27.689
What if this is her,
still fighting?

27:28.148 --> 27:30.608
You really think Mama
knows how to stop her?

27:30.734 --> 27:31.860
Yes.

27:32.319 --> 27:34.863
And now I understand
why I ended up
in the old wing.

27:35.905 --> 27:38.325
According to her files,
this is where her cell was.

27:47.751 --> 27:49.669
She did seven months
straight of solitary in here.

27:49.753 --> 27:51.379
When you cause
trouble in here,
they ignore you.

27:53.131 --> 27:54.591
Pretend to
forget about you.

27:56.134 --> 27:57.385
Jenny.

27:58.011 --> 27:59.179
I think there's
something under here.

28:06.603 --> 28:08.104
Here, hold this.
Here.

28:21.701 --> 28:22.702
Huh.

29:05.078 --> 29:06.204
That song.

29:10.834 --> 29:13.002
I can't believe I didn't
remember it until now.

29:14.754 --> 29:15.880
That day,

29:17.757 --> 29:20.260
<i>Mama was worse than</i>
<i>I'd ever seen her.</i>
<i>Like she'd given up.</i>

29:20.468 --> 29:23.304
When we pick
Abbie up from school,
I'm gonna show her my picture.

29:23.680 --> 29:25.557
It's the three of us,
"My Family."

29:25.807 --> 29:27.225
Do you like it, Mama?

29:27.350 --> 29:28.768
<i>You'll never know, dear</i>

29:28.852 --> 29:30.478
<i>How much I love you</i>

29:31.771 --> 29:33.148
It's beautiful, baby.

29:33.231 --> 29:35.191
<i>Please don't take</i>
<i>my sunshine away</i>

29:36.025 --> 29:37.569
What's that smell?

29:38.987 --> 29:40.447
Mama? Mama, listen to me.

29:40.530 --> 29:43.241
Mama.
Mama, answer me, Mama. Mama!

29:43.616 --> 29:45.076
Mama almost killed me.

29:47.203 --> 29:48.246
We gotta
get out of here.

29:48.705 --> 29:51.499
We gotta get out of here.
No, Abbie.
Jenny. Jenny.

29:51.916 --> 29:53.126
It's all right.
It's all right.

29:53.209 --> 29:54.627
Even when she
was protecting us,
we weren't safe.

29:56.671 --> 29:57.881
You're not safe.

30:09.767 --> 30:10.894
I'll be damned.

30:11.060 --> 30:12.562
Mama.

30:15.106 --> 30:18.109
We know about Lambert,
what she's doing
to people here.

30:19.194 --> 30:21.321
There's an ancient hex
to fight against
the evil spirits.

30:21.988 --> 30:23.656
It's the only way
to stop her.

30:27.452 --> 30:28.745
No, don't.

30:29.204 --> 30:30.788
I tried to remember it, but...

30:32.081 --> 30:34.209
But
it's been too long.

30:34.751 --> 30:37.337
There's a journal.
There's a journal
that belongs to me,

30:37.420 --> 30:39.047
passed down
from the ancestors.

30:39.130 --> 30:40.632
There's powerful
magic in there.

30:40.757 --> 30:41.966
<i>Lori...</i>

30:42.050 --> 30:43.134
Power... Power...

30:43.801 --> 30:44.969
<i>Lori!</i>

30:45.053 --> 30:46.137
Power to fight the evil off.

30:46.387 --> 30:47.639
<i>It's time.</i>

30:47.722 --> 30:49.057
No!
<i>They're mine.</i>

30:49.140 --> 30:50.683
No, no! No!

30:50.767 --> 30:51.893
No, you have to
get out of here!

30:51.976 --> 30:53.019
<i>It's too late.</i>

30:53.102 --> 30:54.270
Don't go.
Now!

30:54.437 --> 30:55.813
Don't take my girls!

31:03.446 --> 31:04.739
Abbie.

31:05.240 --> 31:06.449
Mills!

31:07.951 --> 31:10.370
<i>Mine forever.</i>

31:14.916 --> 31:18.169
I'll get Abbie.
You find that journal, Jenny.

31:21.798 --> 31:22.966
Okay.

31:24.634 --> 31:26.803
You know where
that journal might be?
Yeah, maybe.

31:26.970 --> 31:28.638
There's a storage room
in the basement.

31:36.229 --> 31:37.772
Like mother, like daughter.

31:48.658 --> 31:50.410
You're a broken spirit,

31:50.493 --> 31:52.829
needing to be freed
from this hellish life.

31:52.954 --> 31:55.081
I gave your mother peace.

31:55.999 --> 31:58.042
Don't you want to
know peace, too?

31:58.710 --> 32:02.255
Yes, your soul is
crying out for it.

32:03.339 --> 32:05.508
All I want is for you
to go to hell, bitch!

32:05.967 --> 32:08.636
You do not have
very nice manners,
young lady.

32:13.933 --> 32:14.976
No!

32:15.101 --> 32:16.519
No! No!

32:16.603 --> 32:18.187
This is where
they would've
kept Mama's stuff.

32:18.354 --> 32:19.856
It's the archive room
for the old wing.

32:20.481 --> 32:22.317
Mama's journal would be
with her personal effects.

32:25.153 --> 32:26.362
Yo, Jenny.

32:32.535 --> 32:34.203
She kept it.
Look at this.

32:34.787 --> 32:37.165
Dated at someplace
called Fredericks Manor.

32:37.540 --> 32:38.708
Look at that.
Mama called it.

32:38.916 --> 32:40.877
This journal belonged
to my ancestor, Grace Dixon.

32:41.753 --> 32:43.004
Miss Grace Dixon.

32:43.171 --> 32:45.548
Your reputation for
helping those in need
precedes you.

32:45.715 --> 32:48.301
Push! There, that's it.

32:50.720 --> 32:52.221
A son.

32:52.722 --> 32:53.931
She put anything
in there about a hex

32:54.015 --> 32:55.183
that kills
a demonic nurse?

32:55.558 --> 32:56.684
Give me a second.

32:56.768 --> 32:57.852
Check the back for
an index or something.

32:57.935 --> 32:59.395
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, hold on, this one.

32:59.479 --> 33:01.856
It says it's
a West African
invocation

33:01.939 --> 33:04.984
to expel witch doctors
who had risen from the dead.

33:05.068 --> 33:06.569
Will it kill our ghost?

33:06.694 --> 33:07.904
It'll have to do.

33:11.115 --> 33:12.909
You're overexciting
yourself, dear.

33:13.409 --> 33:16.496
No small wonder.
You have so much
troubling you.

33:16.579 --> 33:18.414
Stay away from me!

33:18.706 --> 33:20.166
Your mother struggled, too.

33:21.876 --> 33:23.753
It's difficult to see
the truth sometimes.

33:25.838 --> 33:27.507
Don't leave me here!

33:27.965 --> 33:30.176
Don't leave me.
Don't leave me in here.

33:30.259 --> 33:32.720
Please don't leave me in here.
Please!

33:33.221 --> 33:34.389
Let me out!

33:34.472 --> 33:36.391
<i>She resisted at first,</i>

33:36.474 --> 33:38.393
<i>but we ended up</i>
<i>seeing eye to eye.</i>

33:40.311 --> 33:43.731
<i>Some of us</i>
<i>aren't strong enough</i>
<i>to bear the burden.</i>

33:43.815 --> 33:47.694
<i>They need an angel of mercy</i>
<i>to help them cross over,</i>

33:47.777 --> 33:49.487
<i>to free them from pain.</i>

33:50.363 --> 33:52.615
Your mother
finally surrendered.

33:53.199 --> 33:54.701
<i>You have to.</i>

33:56.536 --> 33:57.995
<i>End the pain.</i>

33:59.122 --> 34:00.373
<i>Freedom.</i>

34:02.333 --> 34:03.626
<i>Freedom.</i>

34:03.710 --> 34:04.961
<i>Do it.</i>

34:05.545 --> 34:06.671
You killed her.

34:06.796 --> 34:08.089
And now,

34:10.466 --> 34:11.718
it's your turn.

34:23.896 --> 34:25.398
And now we take

34:26.107 --> 34:28.568
your pills.

34:28.651 --> 34:29.652
Mmm-mmm.

34:35.533 --> 34:36.909
Get away from my daughter!

34:37.201 --> 34:38.286
Get away from her!

34:51.632 --> 34:52.759
Really good.

35:09.358 --> 35:11.944
You will obey me, Lori!

35:21.204 --> 35:22.663
I'm not scared
of you anymore!

35:30.338 --> 35:31.464
No!

35:31.672 --> 35:33.174
No!

35:33.674 --> 35:35.843
No, you can't!

35:55.571 --> 35:56.614
Mills?

35:56.697 --> 35:58.324
- Abbie?
- I'm in here.

35:59.408 --> 36:00.993
Oh, Abbie.
Jenny.

36:03.746 --> 36:05.748
They're gone,
both of them.

36:08.584 --> 36:09.836
She fought for me.

36:10.461 --> 36:11.671
She fought for me.

36:15.091 --> 36:16.509
I never got to
tell her thank you.

36:17.301 --> 36:19.178
Just wanted to see her
one more time.

36:24.517 --> 36:25.893
There might be a way.

36:35.111 --> 36:36.737
Thanks for bringing
all of this, Crane.

36:37.655 --> 36:39.198
With the help from
the sleeping aids

36:39.282 --> 36:41.534
Mr. Hawley
graciously forced upon me,

36:41.868 --> 36:44.036
I am feeling better.

36:44.287 --> 36:45.413
Anytime.

36:49.000 --> 36:50.126
You know
what you're doing?

36:50.209 --> 36:51.294
Yeah,
I got this.

37:24.994 --> 37:28.706
Those present,
forgo the coarseness
of thy flesh.

37:29.040 --> 37:30.666
Let thy mind unstick.

37:31.334 --> 37:32.960
And listen to
the spirit realm.

37:33.836 --> 37:37.048
We summon Lori Mills.

37:46.474 --> 37:47.558
Abigail.

37:49.685 --> 37:50.770
Jennifer.

37:52.772 --> 37:53.856
Mama.

37:54.190 --> 37:55.691
My girls.

37:58.361 --> 38:00.029
Look at what
you grew up to be.

38:01.072 --> 38:03.032
You knew all along
that I was a Witness?

38:03.866 --> 38:05.201
Yes.

38:05.409 --> 38:07.662
Why me? Why was I
chosen for this?

38:07.787 --> 38:09.997
There are so many
things you don't get
to choose, Abbie.

38:10.539 --> 38:13.042
Like all those times
they came to take you
away from me.

38:13.876 --> 38:15.044
You have to fight.

38:15.711 --> 38:17.630
<i>You are my sunshine</i>

38:17.880 --> 38:19.507
<i>My only sunshine</i>

38:20.716 --> 38:24.345
<i>You make me happy</i>
<i>when skies are gray</i>

38:39.610 --> 38:41.070
Hold on, baby.

38:42.071 --> 38:43.239
Hold on!

38:52.540 --> 38:54.041
You saved us.

38:54.959 --> 38:56.002
I did.

38:56.961 --> 39:00.506
After they locked me up,
Moloch sent her
to finish me off.

39:02.758 --> 39:04.593
I've been trapped in
this place ever since.

39:09.515 --> 39:12.560
I watched over you, Jenny,
while you were here.

39:13.853 --> 39:18.524
But I did
everything I could
to protect you both.

39:19.775 --> 39:21.736
This was your Purgatory.

39:22.653 --> 39:23.738
Yes.

39:23.821 --> 39:25.781
I have
so many questions.

39:26.782 --> 39:28.659
Moloch may still
be here on Earth.

39:28.826 --> 39:30.244
The journal.

39:30.578 --> 39:31.787
It keeps the secrets.

39:32.121 --> 39:33.164
There's a weapon
hidden in its pages.

39:35.458 --> 39:36.625
You find it.

39:38.794 --> 39:40.755
You were meant to go
further than any of us.

39:43.049 --> 39:44.467
You were meant
to win this war.

39:46.969 --> 39:48.721
You don't deserve
any of this.

39:50.639 --> 39:52.141
How can we free you
from this place?

39:52.224 --> 39:53.768
Oh, sweetheart.

39:58.481 --> 39:59.648
You already did.

40:07.698 --> 40:08.949
Mama.

40:09.158 --> 40:10.493
Oh, please don't go.

40:10.743 --> 40:12.578
- Wait, Mama.
- No.

40:12.661 --> 40:14.371
- Mama, no, wait.
- No, don't go.

40:15.623 --> 40:17.041
Don't go.
Okay.

40:25.132 --> 40:27.218
Even through all that pain,

40:28.719 --> 40:30.262
she kept fighting.

40:31.347 --> 40:33.265
And left you
a fitting legacy.

40:36.018 --> 40:37.228
Jenny.

40:38.896 --> 40:41.065
Forgot how
beautiful she was.

40:57.998 --> 40:59.083
Captain.

41:05.381 --> 41:06.632
Frank, what are you
doing out here?

41:06.715 --> 41:07.842
Police call it
"escaping."

41:07.925 --> 41:10.386
Whatever happened
back there with your mom
gave me an opportunity.

41:10.719 --> 41:13.347
I took it.
Long as I'm in there,
I got a target on my back.

41:13.430 --> 41:14.932
Out here, I got a chance
to make things right.

41:15.558 --> 41:18.060
Don't give me that
aiding-and-abetting-a-fugitive
look, Mills.

41:19.061 --> 41:20.521
You said
I could trust you.

41:20.855 --> 41:22.064
I'm holding you to that.

41:23.107 --> 41:24.567
Now get me out of here.

42:11.405 --> 42:13.199
He's a demon.

42:48.525 --> 42:49.860
I'm hungry, Mother.
