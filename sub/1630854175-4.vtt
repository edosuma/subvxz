39:14.853 --> 39:17.523
Simone: Hey.
Hi.

39:17.556 --> 39:20.358
Thanks for having my back
out there today.

39:20.392 --> 39:22.894
Yeah.
Mm. This one was tough.

39:22.928 --> 39:24.362
Mm.

39:24.396 --> 39:26.064
Can I give you
some more advice?

39:26.097 --> 39:28.867
I'm listening.

39:28.900 --> 39:31.703
We often come face-to-face
with evil here,

39:31.737 --> 39:34.773
and we don't always come out
on top.

39:34.806 --> 39:38.544
So find your own good
somewhere away from this job

39:38.577 --> 39:41.046
and just cling on to it
with all you've got.

39:43.214 --> 39:45.884
You do it, too, you know.
Mask your feelings.

39:45.917 --> 39:48.286
I mean, you were right about me.
I do it sometimes.

39:48.319 --> 39:50.422
But, girl,
you do it all the time.

39:50.456 --> 39:52.558
I respectfully disagree.

39:52.591 --> 39:54.760
Okay.
Well, what about Atlas?

39:54.793 --> 39:57.095
What about him?

39:57.128 --> 40:00.298
It -- It was a one-time thing,
and...

40:00.331 --> 40:02.768
I don't want to, uh,
complicate our friendship.

40:02.801 --> 40:04.636
Mm-kay.

40:04.670 --> 40:08.440
I do like what you said, though,
about finding your own good.

40:08.474 --> 40:11.577
There is, um,
this woman I've been seeing --

40:11.610 --> 40:13.111
Dina.

40:13.144 --> 40:15.581
I'm going to find her.
Mm.

40:15.614 --> 40:19.818
And, um,
you do give solid advice,

40:19.851 --> 40:22.754
but you should also take
some of it.

40:22.788 --> 40:25.791
Because you deserve
to find your own good too.

Brendon:
Oh, my God.

40:31.963 --> 40:33.665
My -- My blood phobia
is gone.

40:33.699 --> 40:35.066
I can look at anything now.

40:35.100 --> 40:36.267
Thank you, sink puppies.

40:36.301 --> 40:38.403
God. You just get weirder
and weirder.

40:38.436 --> 40:39.838
Hey, it was a pleasure
working with you.

40:39.871 --> 40:41.006
You got my number.
Don't be a stranger.

40:41.039 --> 40:42.073
All right.
See you, buddy.

40:42.107 --> 40:43.141
Take it easy.
Yep.

40:45.276 --> 40:46.912
I know why you're
hard on him,

40:46.945 --> 40:49.648
but he could make
a hell of a profiler one day.

40:49.681 --> 40:51.182
I agree.

40:51.216 --> 40:53.919
But don't you dare tell him
I said that.

40:53.952 --> 40:55.787
He has a big enough ego
as it is.

[ Chuckles softly ]

40:57.889 --> 41:00.492
I'm glad D.C. sent you.

41:00.526 --> 41:02.494
We always work well
together.
Mm.

41:02.528 --> 41:08.266
And it was, um, nice,
you know, to, uh...

41:08.299 --> 41:09.367
catch up.

41:09.400 --> 41:12.638
Yeah. Catching up
was my favorite part.

41:12.671 --> 41:14.706
[ Chuckles ]
And, uh...

41:14.740 --> 41:17.375
I want to make it clear
that I'd really like

41:17.408 --> 41:20.912
whatever this thing is
between us to go somewhere.

41:22.213 --> 41:25.216
But I know
that isn't gonna happen.

41:25.250 --> 41:28.720
I hope you know
how much you mean to me,

41:28.754 --> 41:30.722
how much I'd love
to say yes.

41:30.756 --> 41:33.992
But I just -- I lost myself
in my last relationship.

41:35.260 --> 41:38.730
And this move to L.A.,
this unit...

41:38.764 --> 41:40.866
it's about me finding myself
again.

41:40.899 --> 41:41.867
Mm.

41:41.900 --> 41:44.035
Alone.

41:45.170 --> 41:46.104
For now.

41:47.739 --> 41:52.544
But it doesn't mean
we can't keep catching up...

41:52.578 --> 41:53.879
maybe,
before you leave.

41:53.912 --> 41:54.880
Oh.

41:54.913 --> 41:56.715
* Oh, oh, oh, oh
