00:57.322 --> 00:58.622
Comfy?

00:59.524 --> 01:02.726
I'm going to fucking kill you.

01:02.728 --> 01:05.828
Please. Tell me
what you really like...

01:05.830 --> 01:09.733
Oh, Stop with the whole maniacal
killer act ok? It is painful.

01:09.735 --> 01:12.205
Hey Dominic, is
that camera even on?

01:13.304 --> 01:15.906
No. How did you know my name?

01:15.908 --> 01:18.408
Fucking imbeciles.

01:19.610 --> 01:22.479
We can still inflict
a lot more pain on you.

01:22.481 --> 01:24.614
Stop laughing!

01:24.616 --> 01:26.016
Stop laughing!

01:26.952 --> 01:28.385
Whoo!

01:29.721 --> 01:31.921
You know what guys,
I'm done playing the victim.

01:31.923 --> 01:33.789
That part of the movie's over.

01:33.791 --> 01:36.361
I still see fear in your eyes.

01:36.996 --> 01:38.495
Do you wanna see fear?

01:38.497 --> 01:41.465
Oh please, show me.

01:42.368 --> 01:44.737
You promised no chainsaw!

01:45.604 --> 01:47.771
Goddamnit Dominic!

01:49.642 --> 01:51.275
I'm a real fucking artist!

01:51.277 --> 01:52.608
You're a cover band.

01:52.610 --> 01:54.977
Stop criticizing me!

01:57.850 --> 01:59.316
Not afraid to die, huh?

01:59.318 --> 02:02.718
No actually to be honest
with you, I never really have been.

02:02.720 --> 02:04.554
Let's put that to the test.

02:08.626 --> 02:09.625
Do it.

02:09.627 --> 02:10.993
There's one bullet in here.

02:10.995 --> 02:13.863
You dickless
fucking pussy, do it.

02:13.865 --> 02:14.531
Don't!

02:14.533 --> 02:15.432
Do it, do it.

02:15.434 --> 02:16.767
- Don't!
- Do it!

02:16.769 --> 02:17.702
Do it! Do it!

02:17.704 --> 02:18.702
- Stop!
- Do it!

02:34.019 --> 02:36.786
Do you dream?

02:36.788 --> 02:39.822
Do you dream, big?

02:39.824 --> 02:42.426
Do you have
what it takes, but you feel alone

02:42.428 --> 02:46.797
because no one else
sees your true potential?

02:46.799 --> 02:50.499
That used to be me. I was
a beginner, but not anymore.

02:50.501 --> 02:53.936
Now, I'm a master. I'm a
master of my own destiny.

02:55.441 --> 02:58.975
And now, you too
can become a master.

02:58.977 --> 03:01.011
With my patented
Beginner's Guide to Succe...

03:04.716 --> 03:07.919
Three more bodies have
been discovered in the L.A. area,

03:08.353 --> 03:09.753
and while their identities
have yet to be revealed,

03:09.755 --> 03:11.620
Shut up.

03:11.622 --> 03:13.356
Authorities already fear
this may be connected

03:13.358 --> 03:15.624
- to a new crime wave ravaging our city
- Shut up.

03:15.626 --> 03:18.695
Shut up.
Shut up.

03:18.697 --> 03:20.096
Shut up.

03:20.098 --> 03:23.899
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

03:23.901 --> 03:27.636
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

03:27.638 --> 03:30.874
Shut up! Shut up!

03:30.876 --> 03:32.809
- Dresden
- Shut up!

03:32.811 --> 03:35.445
- Dresden!
- Shut up!

03:35.447 --> 03:38.781
Oh, hey Dominic.

03:38.783 --> 03:42.685
Hey, is everything okay?

03:42.687 --> 03:43.987
Where you been little brother?

03:43.989 --> 03:46.022
Ah, just a uh...

03:46.024 --> 03:47.624
another audition
for a commercial

03:47.626 --> 03:49.493
that I have a snowball's
chance in hell of getting

03:55.633 --> 03:59.069
What was the audition?

03:59.071 --> 04:00.670
Ready for it?

04:00.672 --> 04:03.140
DRESDEN
Yeah.

04:03.142 --> 04:04.440
Action.

04:04.442 --> 04:06.878
Hi.

04:08.413 --> 04:09.446
That's it.

04:09.448 --> 04:11.950
That's it?
That's so pathetic.

04:13.585 --> 04:15.152
Is that how
you did it?

04:15.154 --> 04:17.724
Yeah.

04:18.089 --> 04:21.692
You're never
gonna get it.

04:22.927 --> 04:26.862
So, how's the new job?

04:26.864 --> 04:28.799
I think I'm ready for a change.

04:28.801 --> 04:32.068
I mean, we work hard right, I
mean we... we do all the...

04:32.070 --> 04:35.605
all the workouts, we stay in
shape, we meet all the producers

04:35.607 --> 04:37.674
at all the right parties, we go
to all the right coffee shops,

04:37.676 --> 04:38.842
we try to
write scripts,

04:38.844 --> 04:40.042
we drink light
beer, I mean when

04:40.044 --> 04:41.944
are things gonna
change for us man?

04:41.946 --> 04:45.047
I'm just tired of all
these stupid prom kings

04:45.049 --> 04:48.785
move into this town and
boom! They get a sitcom on NBC.

04:48.787 --> 04:49.852
Dresden, you're
a prom king.

04:49.854 --> 04:57.563
That's my point man.
When am I gonna get my sitcom?

04:57.763 --> 05:00.166
So you lost your job again, huh?

05:02.167 --> 05:06.670
What is wrong with you man?
We hired you yesterday,

05:06.672 --> 05:10.540
and in less than 24 hours you
have proceeded to break every

05:10.542 --> 05:14.578
single rule we have.
Oh! And on top of that,

05:14.580 --> 05:17.713
we also have video
surveillance footage

05:17.715 --> 05:21.951
of you defecating in our jungle.

05:23.121 --> 05:25.489
More like creative differences.

05:25.491 --> 05:29.695
You know, probably
means we're gonna have to move back.

05:32.196 --> 05:33.763
Fuck my life.

05:33.765 --> 05:36.665
Hola Boys.

05:36.667 --> 05:38.701
It's your favorite landlord.

05:38.703 --> 05:39.737
Hey, Jorge.

05:39.739 --> 05:42.138
Some of your mail got
mixed up with mine again.

05:42.140 --> 05:43.338
This seems to be
happening a lot, huh?

05:43.340 --> 05:46.809
It's a letter from the DMV and
a sweet note from your mother.

05:46.811 --> 05:47.776
Thanks Jorge.

05:47.778 --> 05:48.778
Hey you wanna do a set?

05:48.780 --> 05:51.181
Get yourself all
summer-primed for all the uh,

05:51.183 --> 05:52.648
señoritas out there.

05:52.650 --> 05:57.754
No I'm fine. I'll
just watch from here.

05:57.756 --> 06:01.790
Oh! I almost forgot,
I wanted to give you this.

06:01.792 --> 06:04.627
I know how much
you like horror movies.

06:04.629 --> 06:06.795
Are you the next
big thing in horror?

06:06.797 --> 06:09.131
Blood & Guts Magazine is now
accepting film submissions.

06:09.133 --> 06:12.936
The grand prize is $250,000,
a feature in the magazine,

06:12.938 --> 06:14.871
and an evening with
Freddie Prinze, Jr.!

06:14.873 --> 06:16.071
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:16.073 --> 06:18.008
Hanging with FPJ?

06:18.010 --> 06:20.042
That's how you get
noticed in this town,

06:20.044 --> 06:21.811
and the deadline's next week.

06:21.813 --> 06:24.980
I'm sorry boys I should've
given it to you sooner.

06:24.982 --> 06:26.148
I'm such a dummy.

06:26.150 --> 06:27.783
Ah, It's okay Jorge.

06:27.785 --> 06:28.951
We're probably
gonna have to pack it in,

06:28.953 --> 06:30.987
head back to Minnesota at
the end of the month anyway.

06:30.989 --> 06:32.956
Don't say that, Dominique.

06:32.958 --> 06:34.658
Hey um, either
of you guys hungry?

06:34.660 --> 06:35.958
I was thinking about
going down to the corner,

06:35.960 --> 06:37.093
to get one of those
five dollar pizzas.

06:37.095 --> 06:41.965
I have to run, I'm late
for my Bollywood dance class.

06:41.967 --> 06:47.336
I really hope that you two can
figure out a way to stay here.

06:47.338 --> 06:51.206
Thanks Jorge. Us too.

07:41.926 --> 07:43.727
Wakey, wakey.

07:44.929 --> 07:48.732
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, no, no,
no. Hey, aye. It's me! It's me!

07:48.734 --> 07:49.999
What the fuck are you doing?

07:50.001 --> 07:51.968
The light bulb went off, dude.

07:51.970 --> 07:52.669
What?

07:52.671 --> 07:56.806
The horror movie competition!

07:56.808 --> 07:59.675
Okay, why are
you wearing bondage?

07:59.677 --> 08:05.814
Because, we're
gonna make a snuff film.

08:05.816 --> 08:07.016
What are you talking about?

08:07.018 --> 08:09.819
The whole hand-held, found-
footage craze, there's been

08:09.821 --> 08:12.021
witches, and
ghosts, and monsters.

08:12.023 --> 08:15.891
Have you ever seen
anyone make a real snuff film?

08:15.893 --> 08:18.227
Jesus Christ, Dresden,
I'm not gonna kill anybody.

08:18.229 --> 08:20.864
No Dominic,
fabricating a real one.

08:20.866 --> 08:21.732
Oh.

08:21.734 --> 08:22.665
We need that money, Dom.

08:22.667 --> 08:25.768
Aren't you more of a
romantic comedy guy?

08:25.770 --> 08:28.872
Well, yeah. But there's
a journey of suffering in both

08:28.874 --> 08:30.674
rom-coms and horror movies.

08:30.676 --> 08:33.943
One just has more gore
and violence than the other.

08:33.945 --> 08:37.881
Dresden, man. We don't even
have money for rent this month.

08:37.883 --> 08:39.381
Don't worry about it. My
buddy at the rental place

08:39.383 --> 08:41.049
will help us out as
far as equipment goes.

08:41.052 --> 08:43.885
And we've got that camera,
you know, that mom gave us.

08:43.888 --> 08:47.156
Oh the one thing I do need
you to do, is put some sides

08:47.158 --> 08:50.059
together for the casting call,
which is gonna be tomorrow.

08:50.061 --> 08:51.094
What? Already?

08:51.096 --> 08:55.030
I think we should
do something iconic, you know,

08:55.032 --> 08:58.901
like, like, uh, like
Jamie Lee Curtis in Halloween.

08:58.903 --> 09:01.136
Dresden man,
I don't think I can...

09:01.138 --> 09:04.873
I'm not going back, Dominic.

09:04.875 --> 09:10.079
I can't go home with my
tail between my legs. I won't.

09:10.081 --> 09:14.317
I can't go back.

09:14.319 --> 09:16.285
I have it all planned out. Eh...

09:16.287 --> 09:19.723
You don't have to do
much, you know. Eh...

09:19.725 --> 09:26.362
Don't you trust
me, baby brother?

09:26.364 --> 09:29.799
What are you doing on the
floor? You gotta get some sleep.

09:29.801 --> 09:35.070
Come on, big day tomorrow.
Yeah, here we go, yeah.

09:35.072 --> 09:39.909
Let's get you
tucked in.

09:39.911 --> 09:43.979
Jamie Lee Curtis. Halloween.

09:43.981 --> 09:47.449
Jamie Lee Curtis

09:47.451 --> 09:54.290
Big day tomorrow.

10:22.486 --> 10:27.891
Hey, Sorry. My uh, my nap
went a little bit long and then uh...

10:27.893 --> 10:29.224
I still had to
print up all the sides.

10:29.226 --> 10:30.425
Hmm.

10:30.427 --> 10:33.029
And then, I had to go to three
different camera stores to get

10:33.031 --> 10:34.863
the backup battery for this
thing. Can you believe that?

10:34.865 --> 10:36.532
What is this?

10:36.534 --> 10:37.733
Best I could do.

10:37.735 --> 10:40.069
Well, she's just telling the
children everything is gonna

10:40.071 --> 10:41.503
be all right. Where's
the... where's the horror?

10:41.505 --> 10:43.872
Where's the drama?

10:43.874 --> 10:45.174
There wasn't any
dialogue in those scenes.

10:45.176 --> 10:45.974
What?

10:45.976 --> 10:47.075
Yeah.

10:47.077 --> 10:48.812
No, trust me, I
skimmed the whole thing.

10:48.814 --> 10:51.113
Jamie Lee Curtis's character
doesn't say a word to Michael

10:51.115 --> 10:52.415
Myers the whole movie.

10:52.417 --> 10:53.849
Really?

10:53.851 --> 10:55.084
Yep.

10:55.086 --> 10:58.987
Huh. Well, shit. We're just
gonna have to wing it. You know

10:58.989 --> 11:01.123
what, we need to see their
improvisational skills anyways

11:01.125 --> 11:04.227
So, when you're out there,
don't say anything about this

11:04.229 --> 11:06.996
being a snuff film. We're
calling it "experimental"

11:06.998 --> 11:08.164
at this point.

11:08.166 --> 11:11.133
Experimental.

11:11.135 --> 11:13.569
Hi, thanks for coming
in. Do you have any pets?

11:13.571 --> 11:16.506
I do, I've got a
little Yorkie named Alfonso.

11:16.508 --> 11:20.142
Aw, that's great.
Alfonso, that's a cute name.

11:20.144 --> 11:23.847
Okay, now when I clap my hands,
I want you to imagine that

11:23.849 --> 11:26.849
you're with Alfonso and he's
just been crushed by a big rig

11:26.851 --> 11:28.351
right in front of you. And...

11:29.553 --> 11:31.054
Are you serious?

11:31.056 --> 11:32.155
Do you have a boyfriend?

11:32.157 --> 11:34.958
Um, Sort of.

11:34.960 --> 11:36.525
How much older is he than you?

11:36.527 --> 11:40.096
- I play, like, 18 to 24.
- But how old are you really?

11:40.098 --> 11:41.296
18 to 24.

11:41.298 --> 11:44.299
Well Chupacabras
have this magical language.

11:44.301 --> 11:46.569
That has nothing to
do with this audition.

11:46.571 --> 11:49.238
You're a real
asshole, you know that?

11:49.240 --> 11:50.607
I do know that I'm an asshole,

11:50.609 --> 11:52.641
do you know that
you're an actress?

11:52.643 --> 11:58.481
I'm gonna miss you so
much, all the time we spent together.

11:58.483 --> 12:02.084
If you were on a
deserted island, and you had

12:02.086 --> 12:05.622
just yourself to be there,
would you kill yourself?

12:05.624 --> 12:06.522
No.

12:06.524 --> 12:07.857
Do you have a dog at home?

12:07.859 --> 12:08.992
- Yeah.
- We just got a call while you

12:08.994 --> 12:13.328
were in the lobby, your
dog has been killed. Action.

12:14.932 --> 12:18.367
You're my best friend.

12:21.406 --> 12:26.309
My little sweet pea, my angel.

12:26.311 --> 12:29.478
Obviously from your
read, you've never acted before.

12:29.480 --> 12:32.147
So, what do you wanna do?

12:32.149 --> 12:35.017
I'm really sure that
you're gonna be an excellent director.

12:35.019 --> 12:38.921
I can tell by that dipshit,
douche-rag, dribble cloth...

12:38.923 --> 12:40.189
you have tied around your neck.

12:40.191 --> 12:43.392
This was my
grandfather's kerchief,

12:43.394 --> 12:44.727
and he died
in Pearl Harbor.

12:44.729 --> 12:47.329
It's like in a tone
that human beings can't hear.

12:47.331 --> 12:48.698
So it's like
really hard to get it.

12:49.835 --> 12:52.101
I took a picture on Instragram
of my dog this morning,

12:52.103 --> 12:53.502
My dog is not dead.

12:53.504 --> 12:55.570
Do it again, and
maybe do it in English this time.

12:55.572 --> 12:56.973
You're awful.

12:56.975 --> 12:58.674
So when you fuck a
cop, they give you F.O.P. cards?

12:58.676 --> 13:00.642
Yeah, friend of police cards.

13:00.644 --> 13:03.179
I bet you just pull
those right out of your va-jan-jan.

13:03.181 --> 13:05.113
Good luck with your
shitty experimental film.

13:05.115 --> 13:07.717
Yeah, good luck with your
shitty experimental life.

13:07.719 --> 13:09.251
You guys are so unprofessional.

13:09.253 --> 13:11.554
Is there anything you
want me to do that's legitimate or...

13:11.556 --> 13:13.055
Yeah, uh.

13:13.057 --> 13:15.223
...should we just talk about the
things I have shoved

13:15.225 --> 13:18.294
in my vagina all day?

13:18.296 --> 13:19.495
Can you do it again?

13:19.497 --> 13:24.132
Sure, is there anything you
would like me to do different?

13:24.134 --> 13:27.971
Do it as if you're
actually a good actress.

13:27.973 --> 13:30.106
I think I'm done here.

13:30.108 --> 13:31.741
What is going on here?
Is this some kind of joke?

13:31.743 --> 13:35.178
The fuck is wrong with you?

13:35.180 --> 13:38.213
You're such a bad actress.

13:38.215 --> 13:40.382
Okay, fuck you.

13:40.384 --> 13:42.285
Bring in the next one.

13:42.287 --> 13:44.520
We gotta
be about done, right?

13:44.522 --> 13:50.093
I can only pray.

14:08.013 --> 14:10.346
Hello over there.

14:10.348 --> 14:15.083
Hi. Hi, sorry, hi.

14:15.085 --> 14:16.785
Um, where did everybody go?

14:16.787 --> 14:19.122
Well, there was
talk of the director

14:19.124 --> 14:22.558
being a complete
asshole, so everybody left.

14:22.560 --> 14:28.064
Term has been thrown
around a little bit today.

14:28.066 --> 14:29.531
Why'd you stay?

14:29.533 --> 14:31.733
Well, the last people that I
trust are the other actresses

14:31.735 --> 14:35.670
auditioning for
the same role as I am.

14:35.672 --> 14:42.178
And you know what,
you don't look so scary.

14:42.180 --> 14:51.420
I'm not, um, I'm also not
the... the uh... director. So uh...

14:51.422 --> 14:55.491
What's the
fucking hold up, Dominic?!

14:55.493 --> 14:58.060
I'm Dominic.

15:06.236 --> 15:10.073
Hi, I'm Jennifer.

15:10.075 --> 15:19.482
Yes you are, Jennifer,
please, Jennifer have a seat.

15:19.484 --> 15:22.150
Uh, we're not gonna
be using those sides, you can

15:22.152 --> 15:24.087
discard them.

15:24.089 --> 15:27.122
Halloween?

15:27.124 --> 15:28.091
You know your movies.

15:28.093 --> 15:30.492
I'm a horror fanatic.

15:30.494 --> 15:32.295
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

15:34.832 --> 15:38.233
Me too. Uh, not
Dresden though, he's a uh,

15:38.235 --> 15:40.502
he's a romantic comedy guy.

15:40.504 --> 15:42.405
Ay, Thank you, Dominic.

15:42.407 --> 15:43.705
Seems like quite
a jump from rom-com

15:43.707 --> 15:45.141
to horror, don't you think?

15:45.143 --> 15:46.409
- That's exactly what I said.
- A really big jump, right?

15:46.411 --> 15:47.644
That's actually, that's actually
not. What I had said to Dominic,

15:47.646 --> 15:51.213
there is a very similar art
that happens in... you know what?

15:51.215 --> 15:53.181
Sorry, cut, no.

15:53.183 --> 15:55.650
You're auditioning for us,
it's not the other way around.

15:55.652 --> 15:59.755
You're absolutely right,
I'm sorry. Please continue.

15:59.757 --> 16:02.324
Dominic, I'm gonna wanna
go handheld for this one.

16:02.326 --> 16:06.761
Okay.

16:06.763 --> 16:08.830
Let me know
when we're rolling.

16:08.832 --> 16:10.165
And...

16:10.167 --> 16:12.801
Camera speeds.

16:12.803 --> 16:15.905
Action.

16:15.907 --> 16:17.439
Do you have a dog?

16:17.441 --> 16:21.511
I had a Chihuahua,
a little baby girl.

16:21.513 --> 16:23.312
She died six months ago.

16:23.314 --> 16:25.314
Jesus Christ, does
every actress in this town

16:25.316 --> 16:26.616
have a small fucking dog.

16:26.618 --> 16:31.319
Had... a dog.

16:31.321 --> 16:34.857
Okay, well, let's just imagine
that your little Chihuahua

16:34.859 --> 16:36.925
is still alive, only barely.

16:36.927 --> 16:39.261
The two of you been in the
desert for the last three days,

16:39.263 --> 16:40.630
you're about to die.

16:40.632 --> 16:42.330
But the pint of blood
in that little guy is...

16:42.332 --> 16:43.766
Girl.

16:43.768 --> 16:44.934
Girl.

16:44.936 --> 16:46.135
The pint of blood in that
little bitch is the only thing

16:46.137 --> 16:49.338
that's gonna keep you alive.
You're about to strangle her

16:49.340 --> 16:51.940
to death but you wanna
say goodbye to her first.

16:51.942 --> 16:55.243
Can you work with that?
Thoughts?

16:55.245 --> 16:56.846
Scenario a
little too much for you?

16:56.848 --> 16:58.514
My first thought is,

16:58.516 --> 17:02.418
I wish I had bought a
fuckin bigger dog. Right?

17:02.420 --> 17:04.921
I mean a bigger dog, like
a fucking great dane, right?

17:04.923 --> 17:06.789
Pounds of blood in that fucker,

17:06.790 --> 17:10.893
Just go to town on it. Right?

17:10.895 --> 17:14.829
What an awesome question! Good
for you! Kind of improv thing.

17:14.830 --> 17:16.866
Keep it going! What's
the next question? I'm ready.

17:16.867 --> 17:18.701
Let's cut.

17:31.282 --> 17:32.915
She wasn't bad.

17:32.917 --> 17:35.318
She wasn't good either.

17:36.920 --> 17:38.620
What about her?

17:38.622 --> 17:41.490
No. There's that
damn dog again.

17:41.492 --> 17:44.993
Okay. What about this one?

17:44.995 --> 17:49.232
Um, she has potential bu...
shut that god damn dog up!

17:49.234 --> 17:51.466
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

17:51.468 --> 17:55.271
- Shut up!
- Dresden! Dresden!

17:55.273 --> 17:56.405
You can barely
hear the thing.

17:58.876 --> 18:03.913
Come on man,
we're on a time crunch.

18:03.915 --> 18:07.250
Okay, here... here's the
thing Dom. I don't think,

18:07.252 --> 18:10.252
any of these girls can
help us win that contest.

18:10.254 --> 18:13.556
And I think you know that.

18:13.558 --> 18:16.692
She could.

18:16.694 --> 18:18.694
She could! I really liked her.

18:18.696 --> 18:22.865
I know you did. And
she's good I... I liked her but

18:22.867 --> 18:25.568
I don't think that without
the proper inspiration

18:25.570 --> 18:29.004
she'll be able
to deliver for us.

18:29.006 --> 18:31.507
What do you mean by
proper inspiration?

18:31.509 --> 18:33.842
Okay, you might not
like what I'm about to say

18:33.844 --> 18:37.646
but just hear me out, all right?

18:37.648 --> 18:39.882
She has to think it's real.

18:39.884 --> 18:41.983
If she thinks it's
real she's gonna give us

18:41.985 --> 18:46.055
an amazing performance.
I mean, we're talking about

18:46.057 --> 18:47.990
a performance of her lifetime.

18:47.992 --> 18:51.926
So you wanna... you
wanna actually kidnap her,

18:51.928 --> 18:54.030
and then pretend, like,
we're gonna kill her,

18:54.032 --> 18:55.998
and she's gonna
thank us for it?

18:56.000 --> 19:00.336
Well there's a little bit
more to it then that but, yeah.

19:00.338 --> 19:03.772
In a nutshell, yeah.

19:06.610 --> 19:13.616
That's... you're funny man.
You really had me going.

19:13.618 --> 19:17.052
You're serious? You've
officially lost your mind!

19:17.054 --> 19:21.723
No I h... no I haven't, no.
We let her in on it, you know,

19:21.725 --> 19:24.527
after we have her
amazing performance.

19:24.529 --> 19:28.030
Then when she's had some time
to cool off, because arguably

19:28.032 --> 19:29.932
she may be a little upset,
and we sit down with her...

19:29.934 --> 19:31.000
This is insane, this is...

19:31.002 --> 19:32.934
I can't believe what you're
actually saying to me.

19:32.936 --> 19:36.071
Dominic! If we're
gonna do something great,

19:36.073 --> 19:37.839
we've got to not
only break the rules,

19:37.841 --> 19:40.443
we have to break the
proverbial fucking mold!

19:40.445 --> 19:43.011
I mean we're talking about a
snuff film here. This thing has

19:43.013 --> 19:45.748
to feel real and...
and... and... and... and...

19:45.750 --> 19:48.584
...and raw, and gritty, and
dangerous, but none of that

19:48.586 --> 19:54.956
matters if the audience doesn't
really empathize with this girl.

19:54.958 --> 19:58.126
Okay, all right, wow... okay.
So what if we tell her afterwards,

19:58.128 --> 20:01.629
we fill her in and she
doesn't go for it. What then?

20:01.631 --> 20:03.965
What do all actresses want?

20:03.967 --> 20:05.067
To act.

20:05.069 --> 20:08.069
No, to be famous.

20:08.071 --> 20:09.905
I'm an actor. I want to act.

20:09.907 --> 20:12.808
Oh, oh really?

20:12.810 --> 20:16.145
Hi. That's acting? There's
a community theatre right down

20:16.147 --> 20:18.780
the street you can act your
fucking nuts off all day long.

20:18.782 --> 20:21.751
No man, because you're willing
to pay the price for fame.

20:21.753 --> 20:26.621
You're willing to sacrifice all
that you have, all that you are.

20:26.623 --> 20:28.491
Just like me.

20:28.493 --> 20:31.394
Just like her.

20:31.396 --> 20:33.995
That's why we're in this town.

20:33.997 --> 20:35.964
Again, what if she
doesn't go for it?

20:35.966 --> 20:41.703
Trust me. When she wins her
Oscar, she'll be thanking us.

20:41.705 --> 20:47.409
No. No. No.

20:49.580 --> 20:56.751
Fine. I don't
know about you man, but...

20:56.753 --> 20:59.155
...this isn't what I wanted.

20:59.157 --> 21:07.029
I mean our TV is deeper than
it is wide. We deserve more man.

21:07.031 --> 21:09.498
We deserve a house

21:09.500 --> 21:11.800
in the Hollywood
Hills, you know?

21:11.802 --> 21:16.504
With an infinity pool, stocked
with music video hoes just

21:16.506 --> 21:19.707
dancing, and having
fun, and pouring champagne,

21:19.709 --> 21:21.676
and slapping each others' asses,

21:21.678 --> 21:23.111
and they're there
because we pay them.

21:23.113 --> 21:25.447
Because we have
that much money.

21:25.449 --> 21:28.216
To have them
their 24/7, and a boat.

21:28.218 --> 21:31.119
We deserve a really,
really long...

21:31.121 --> 21:32.620
- Dresden. Dresden.
- ...speedboat.

21:32.622 --> 21:33.923
This is crazy!

21:33.925 --> 21:36.559
Said every producer
to every risk taking,

21:36.561 --> 21:38.059
visionary filmmaker.

21:38.061 --> 21:39.794
No, this is prison shit.

21:39.796 --> 21:44.066
Think about it. If we do
this right, we'll be famous.

21:44.068 --> 21:46.902
And famous people
are untouchable:

21:46.904 --> 21:49.938
Roman Polanski, Woody Allen, OJ,

21:49.940 --> 21:54.844
Michael Jackson
slept with little boys.

21:54.846 --> 21:58.213
This is our time, baby brother.

21:58.215 --> 22:01.250
This is that one chance
that we'll always regret

22:01.252 --> 22:05.521
if we don't seize it now,

22:05.523 --> 22:08.857
and that's
downright un-American.

22:24.774 --> 22:26.942
What are we missing?

22:26.944 --> 22:28.676
I think we'e good.
So uh, what's the plan?

22:30.615 --> 22:33.115
Uh, tomorrow night we
break into her house.

22:33.117 --> 22:36.618
You know, her resume said that
she knew, um, Brazilian jiujitsu

22:36.620 --> 22:39.655
and Krav Maga, that's that
Israeli special forces shit.

22:39.657 --> 22:42.258
All actresses put that
on their resume to stand out,

22:42.260 --> 22:43.858
wouldn't worry about it.

22:43.860 --> 22:44.894
I'll make ya famous!

22:44.896 --> 22:46.861
Whoa take it easy,
there's a bullet in there.

22:46.863 --> 22:49.130
What? Why?
Isn't this all props?

22:49.132 --> 22:52.166
Do you know how
much real props cost?

22:52.168 --> 22:53.735
Why is there only one bullet?

22:53.737 --> 22:55.803
Do you know how
much bullets cost?

22:55.805 --> 22:57.873
Just don't touch it, all right?

22:57.875 --> 22:59.742
Hola, boys.

22:59.744 --> 23:01.976
It's your favorite landlord.

23:01.978 --> 23:03.811
Hey, Jorge.

23:03.813 --> 23:05.880
Whoa, Jorge, looking spiffy.

23:05.882 --> 23:08.216
Oh, looks like you
just came from a make out session

23:08.218 --> 23:10.251
with some chick. You
still got lipstick on.

23:10.253 --> 23:12.120
I'm just meeting some
friends out for drinks.

23:12.122 --> 23:13.888
Oh, you're going
hunting for the ladies?

23:15.158 --> 23:16.892
It's more like a boys night out.

23:16.894 --> 23:20.628
Oh just some brews
with the bros. I get that.

23:20.630 --> 23:21.996
- Thank you.
- What are those?

23:21.998 --> 23:23.965
Jorge has a place where
we can shoot the movie.

23:23.967 --> 23:27.136
I'm so proud of you
two following your dreams.

23:27.138 --> 23:29.871
I can't wait to take him
hunting back in Minnesota.

23:29.873 --> 23:31.639
Aw man, he would love that.

23:31.641 --> 23:33.207
- He'd fit right in.
- Yeah.

23:33.209 --> 23:38.313
Right. Well, I'm off. Uh, please
remember to lock up, have fun,

23:38.315 --> 23:42.885
but I rent out the other
half. Oh and boys listen,

23:42.887 --> 23:47.889
they're finding lots of dead men
around town with their penises...

23:47.891 --> 23:49.992
...cut off.

23:49.994 --> 23:51.694
Who would want a penis?

23:51.696 --> 23:53.695
Be careful, I worry.

23:55.099 --> 23:57.199
Thanks Jorge.

24:20.858 --> 24:25.394
I said don't disturb me.

24:28.064 --> 24:29.665
How'd I look?

24:29.667 --> 24:31.000
- Really creepy.
- Ok, good.

24:31.002 --> 24:33.202
That should
set up the villain nicely.

24:33.204 --> 24:34.302
How do you make a snuff film?

24:34.304 --> 24:37.338
There are five rules to
making a real snuff film.

24:37.340 --> 24:41.276
One, you choose your
victim, preferably female.

24:41.278 --> 24:46.181
Two, you kidnap that victim.
Three, you take that victim to

24:46.183 --> 24:49.818
an undisclosed location where
no one can hear them scream,

24:49.820 --> 24:54.123
very important. The...
Four, you torture your victim

24:54.125 --> 24:57.059
preferably with some
sort of sexual misconduct.

24:57.061 --> 25:02.164
And five, you kill your victim.

25:02.166 --> 25:04.799
I- I have a real
problem with number five.

25:04.801 --> 25:05.701
Dominic.

25:05.703 --> 25:06.402
What?

25:06.404 --> 25:08.236
We have to go soon, get ready.

25:08.238 --> 25:10.105
Okay.

25:22.119 --> 25:25.319
The 2 bodies found early
this morning have been added to the

25:25.321 --> 25:28.190
murder tally revolving
around these mutilations.

25:28.192 --> 25:30.291
Authorities are now
linking the murders to a local

25:30.293 --> 25:33.361
Mexican cartel.
Each victim is male,

25:33.363 --> 25:36.298
and authorities believe
the cartel is sending a strong

25:36.300 --> 25:42.471
message as all the victims
penises have been severed.

25:42.473 --> 25:43.405
You're sure this is it?

25:43.407 --> 25:46.375
Yeah, her resume
had her direct contact.

25:46.377 --> 25:49.011
Googled her and the address
came right up. It's kind of...

25:49.013 --> 25:50.945
scary how easy it was actually.

25:50.947 --> 25:53.315
Whoo! You ready?

25:53.317 --> 25:55.184
I'm pretty fuckin'
nervous, to be honest.

25:58.121 --> 26:01.956
I said, are you ready?

26:01.958 --> 26:03.492
Ready as I'll ever be.

26:04.395 --> 26:08.163
Hey, what's in the bucket?

26:08.165 --> 26:11.733
It's a surprise.

26:11.735 --> 26:13.868
Oh here, wear this.

26:13.870 --> 26:15.104
Why are you talking like Batman?

26:15.106 --> 26:17.505
Because it's scary.

26:17.507 --> 26:18.807
Oh, no.

26:18.809 --> 26:19.974
- I'm not wearing this.
- Yes, you are.

26:19.976 --> 26:21.743
- No, I'm not.
- I got that just for you!

26:21.745 --> 26:23.011
What if God sees this?

26:23.013 --> 26:26.781
It's hysterical.
Come on, it makes the movie.

26:27.384 --> 26:29.251
Don't laugh.

26:29.253 --> 26:31.854
Controversy sells, baby.

26:31.856 --> 26:33.055
That voice is stupid, you know.

26:33.057 --> 26:34.155
No it's not.
Yes it is.

26:34.157 --> 26:35.389
You're stupid.

26:35.391 --> 26:37.259
Wipe that look off your face.
Okay then.

26:37.261 --> 26:38.493
I'm gonna
disguise my voice too.

26:38.495 --> 26:41.496
Focus! All right, look, look.
Seriously though, no matter what

26:41.498 --> 26:44.966
happens in there,
never, ever, stop filming.

26:44.968 --> 26:45.768
Ever?

26:45.770 --> 26:46.703
Never.

26:46.705 --> 26:48.236
Wha... I mean, what if
something goes wrong?

26:49.307 --> 26:51.072
No, no, no. We... we need
a... We need a safe-word.

26:51.074 --> 26:53.274
Nah, safe-words are for...
for quitters.

26:53.276 --> 26:54.108
Mockingjay.

26:54.110 --> 26:58.213
How about,

26:58.215 --> 27:02.850
Robert De Niro. Are
you looking at me? Bang.

27:02.852 --> 27:04.485
Gun, under my sleeve.

27:12.463 --> 27:17.232
Dresden, you know when we
were kids and you got sent away

27:17.234 --> 27:19.033
cause yah... you know... you
lost your temper and you...

27:19.035 --> 27:21.036
you beat that
kid up really bad.

27:21.038 --> 27:25.339
What? You mean, like, when I was
a young stupid kid and didn't

27:25.341 --> 27:29.077
know better? Like, so long
ago that I don't even really

27:29.079 --> 27:30.546
remember what happened?

27:30.548 --> 27:33.048
Done with all that stuff right?

27:33.050 --> 27:36.451
Ye... Yeah. You... You're around
me, what like, every day for

27:36.453 --> 27:38.886
how long? What do you think?

27:38.888 --> 27:40.422
Come on, focus. You're
starting to act really weird.

27:40.424 --> 27:41.557
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- We gotta go in there.

27:41.559 --> 27:43.858
All right, let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

27:43.860 --> 27:45.493
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

27:47.298 --> 27:49.164
Come on, come
on, come on, come on.

27:50.834 --> 27:53.969
Hello window.

27:55.305 --> 27:57.071
Door.

27:57.073 --> 27:58.874
Damn it.

27:58.876 --> 28:00.309
Nope.

28:01.446 --> 28:08.349
Oooh. Gotta get this one.
One, two, three! Aw shit.

28:14.225 --> 28:17.125
Come on.

28:17.127 --> 28:21.396
Hey! This door's
open, come on, come on.

28:23.067 --> 28:25.267
Give me that camera.

28:33.377 --> 28:37.511
There's a lot
of girly shit in here.

28:37.513 --> 28:38.880
That's her right?

28:38.882 --> 28:41.385
Yeah.

28:45.289 --> 28:48.126
Come on.

28:50.127 --> 28:52.830
Over here?

28:57.635 --> 29:00.434
She's not there. Fuck.

29:00.436 --> 29:02.003
I guess we wait.

29:02.005 --> 29:03.437
Okay.

29:10.380 --> 29:11.512
Aw, that's dope.

29:11.514 --> 29:12.713
Hey, whatcha doing?

29:12.715 --> 29:17.485
Uh, just getting some awesome
shit for the opening sequence.

29:17.487 --> 29:20.955
Get the audience to really learn
about our my main character,

29:20.957 --> 29:23.058
so that they really
feel for her later

29:23.060 --> 29:27.529
when she's in our clutches.

29:27.531 --> 29:30.632
Look at all this
healthy organic shit.

29:30.634 --> 29:33.635
Dom, what are you
doing? Seriously?

29:33.637 --> 29:36.203
I got snacks in the car, I
brought doughnuts and red vines.

29:36.205 --> 29:38.040
I eat when I'm
nervous, you know that.

29:38.042 --> 29:40.207
- Well, put it back.
- Fine, don't worry about it. No!

29:40.209 --> 29:41.510
Yes, you're getting
granola everywhere.

29:42.647 --> 29:43.646
Stop, Just go film your
opening, don't worry about me.

29:43.648 --> 29:47.081
I've filmed the opening.
Put it down! Serious...

29:50.454 --> 29:52.421
Hi sweetie.

29:55.292 --> 29:58.126
Oh, shit.

29:58.128 --> 30:00.095
Did you hear her head hit the ground?
Oh no.

30:00.097 --> 30:02.129
Oh we gotta get out of
here man, we gotta get out.

30:02.131 --> 30:04.199
What are we... no, no, no. We're...
we're not going anywhere.

30:04.201 --> 30:06.667
We're gonna tie her up. I was
hoping for a better

30:06.669 --> 30:08.436
abduction scene than...

30:08.438 --> 30:10.004
I guess fainting's
pretty cool.

30:10.006 --> 30:11.473
She might have a
hematoma man.

30:11.475 --> 30:12.574
Why am I not
getting this?

30:12.576 --> 30:13.674
We might have to intubate.

30:13.676 --> 30:14.776
What?

30:14.778 --> 30:16.278
Yeah, do you have a...
do you have a pen? Just in case.

30:16.280 --> 30:17.245
No, no, no, she's fine.

30:17.247 --> 30:19.380
Stop using big words
that you don't understand.

30:19.382 --> 30:21.316
I auditioned for that
doctor role, remember?

30:21.318 --> 30:23.151
And I did my research, I
know what I'm talking about.

30:23.153 --> 30:24.219
Ahh.

30:24.221 --> 30:26.687
Ohhhh! She's
definitely not dead!

30:26.689 --> 30:30.058
Oh, my God. Ow...

30:33.163 --> 30:38.099
Help! Help! Get off me!

30:40.137 --> 30:41.603
Get the camera!

30:41.605 --> 30:45.706
Get this up! I
mean, I've got her now.

30:45.708 --> 30:48.143
Oh! She's gonna break my arm!
She's going to break my arm!

30:48.145 --> 30:49.377
Oh, that's
that Brazilian jiujitsu

30:49.379 --> 30:50.412
I was telling you about.

30:50.414 --> 30:51.680
She's breaking my arm.

30:52.382 --> 30:53.348
Put the camera down and help me!

30:53.350 --> 30:56.585
It's painful! Ahh!
Mr. President! Help me!

30:56.587 --> 30:57.520
Nope.

30:57.522 --> 30:59.021
She's much stronger than
we anticipated.

30:59.023 --> 31:00.422
Do you want me to put the camera
down?

31:00.424 --> 31:02.223
Yes, put the
camera down and help.

31:02.225 --> 31:03.358
There's a word,

31:03.360 --> 31:04.760
you know, that we talked about
and I haven't heard it.

31:04.762 --> 31:07.596
I-I don't remember what it is!

31:07.598 --> 31:08.663
Ahh!

31:08.665 --> 31:11.133
Robert De Niro!

31:11.135 --> 31:13.135
Bingo! That's the safe-word.

31:17.640 --> 31:19.674
Hold her down!

31:19.676 --> 31:20.642
Brought zip ties.

31:22.513 --> 31:24.445
God damn it! Get off me!

31:24.447 --> 31:27.148
- Get your hands off me, fucker!
- Stop squirming, little lady.

31:27.150 --> 31:30.519
Everything will be just fine.

31:30.521 --> 31:34.155
Get her hands. She's
quite a fighter isn't she?

31:34.157 --> 31:34.656
Fucker!

31:34.658 --> 31:36.457
Ahh, take it easy.

31:37.427 --> 31:41.629
It's a lot harder than you
think, huh? Ahh!

31:41.631 --> 31:44.799
You can take
anything that you want.

31:44.801 --> 31:48.103
What do you think we're doing?

31:48.105 --> 31:50.137
No! I...

31:50.139 --> 31:51.639
Nice and tight.

31:51.641 --> 31:55.543
Um, uh, go uh, outside, take the
camera and we're gonna film us

31:55.545 --> 31:59.146
come up through the stairs and
um, and try to get it on a nice

31:59.148 --> 32:02.250
even plane so it can
match the shot from before,

32:02.252 --> 32:05.153
be able to splice this
together so go ahead.

32:09.827 --> 32:11.693
And, action!

32:14.798 --> 32:17.765
Like a tiger
taking down a gazelle.

32:17.767 --> 32:23.305
Your resistance is
futile. And cut, did you get it?

32:23.307 --> 32:25.740
I accidentally, touched
one of her tits, they're real.

32:25.742 --> 32:26.441
Yeah, yeah!

32:26.443 --> 32:29.446
Let's bag her up.

32:30.880 --> 32:33.315
Wait.

32:33.317 --> 32:36.851
What are you doing? This is a
kidnapping, not a pantie raid!

32:36.853 --> 32:38.787
Well, do you like
what she's wearing?

32:38.789 --> 32:40.621
Don't you think we
should have some options?

32:40.623 --> 32:46.560
Great idea. We didn't have
a budget for wardrobe. Wait...

32:46.562 --> 32:49.364
Alright, come on.
It's just a pillowcase!

32:49.366 --> 32:51.199
It's your own
pillowcase! Put it on.

32:51.201 --> 32:51.867
- No!
- Yes!

32:51.869 --> 32:54.168
Put it on here, there we go.

32:55.606 --> 32:59.174
Whoo!
That is a rush.

32:59.176 --> 33:00.675
Oww!

33:00.677 --> 33:04.512
She's a lot stronger than I
was expecting, but we took her down.

33:04.514 --> 33:06.447
Yeah, yeah.

33:06.449 --> 33:07.682
Oh, my God, that was crazy.

33:07.684 --> 33:09.416
It wasn't as bad as I
thought it was gonna be.

33:09.418 --> 33:12.620
That was fuckin' great, God, what
a fucking rush. I can see our

33:12.622 --> 33:17.658
- name now... the marquee...
- our names in light.

33:24.600 --> 33:27.769
You hear that?

33:27.771 --> 33:29.203
Oh, jeez.

33:29.205 --> 33:32.206
Oh, I'm pulling over, this
is perfect. Are you rolling that?

33:32.208 --> 33:33.308
- You gotta get...
- I'm rolling, I'm rolling.

33:33.310 --> 33:37.345
This would be a perfect
bridge for the second act.

33:43.286 --> 33:44.853
I bet you're...

33:49.926 --> 33:53.528
I bet you're pretty
disgusted with that gross

33:53.530 --> 34:01.502
disgusting trunk, aren't
you? That's where you live now.

34:17.888 --> 34:21.590
Are we done?

34:21.592 --> 34:25.927
Yeah, I guess so.
All right, let's go.

34:25.929 --> 34:26.994
All right.

34:31.768 --> 34:33.134
Is this Jorge's place?

34:33.136 --> 34:35.270
Yeah... yeah, I came
by yesterday and set everything up,

34:35.272 --> 34:37.905
it's great. I think
Jorge is really into

34:37.907 --> 34:40.842
costume parties or something.

34:45.348 --> 34:47.782
Are you rolling?

34:47.784 --> 34:50.384
♪ Beautiful Babies ♪

34:50.386 --> 34:54.021

Help me! Help me!

35:29.826 --> 35:32.494
Help me!

35:32.496 --> 35:35.764
That was awesome. All
right, let's let her think about

35:35.766 --> 35:38.800
that for a minute. I'ma lock
this place up, make sure there's

35:38.802 --> 35:39.900
no chance of escape.

35:39.902 --> 35:41.402
Somebody please!

Hello? Hello? Is someone there?

36:20.576 --> 36:25.846

36:31.788 --> 36:38.360

36:38.362 --> 36:44.799
Listen, I promise you it's all
gonna be over soon, okay?

36:44.801 --> 36:48.103
Oh, my God, what does that mean?

36:48.105 --> 36:48.637
No!

36:48.639 --> 36:49.505
What does that mean?

36:49.507 --> 36:50.338
No, no, no. That's
not what I meant.

36:50.340 --> 36:51.840
- Oh, my God.
- That's not what I meant.

36:51.842 --> 36:53.741
I'm sorry.

36:53.743 --> 36:54.909
What the fuck was that?

36:54.911 --> 36:57.846
Nothing. I jus... it
was nothing. It's nothing

36:57.848 --> 36:59.848
No, I mean that
accent. Was that English?

36:59.850 --> 37:00.514
Yeah.

37:00.516 --> 37:00.915
Irish?

37:00.917 --> 37:01.549
Yeah.

37:01.551 --> 37:01.983
Hungarian?

37:01.985 --> 37:03.418
Yeah.

37:03.420 --> 37:07.422
I love it. Come on,
I got a surprise for you.

37:07.424 --> 37:08.458
Okay.

37:12.728 --> 37:13.962
Here's my dojo.

37:13.964 --> 37:18.166
Wow, nice set-up.
Where'd you get all this gear?

37:18.168 --> 37:20.168
Ah, pulled a few favors, ah,

37:20.170 --> 37:21.969
maxed out the last
of our credit cards.

37:21.971 --> 37:22.971
What's that one for?

37:22.973 --> 37:24.773
Well, if the movie's a
hit, we're gonna want a

37:24.775 --> 37:27.041
"making of" for the Blu-Ray.

37:27.043 --> 37:30.648
I gotta hand it to you.
You're thinking big. I like it.

37:31.014 --> 37:34.047
So the shot of me carrying
her in, that was great, huh?

37:34.049 --> 37:36.483
Yeah. Yeah it was pretty good. I
think we should shoot it again.

37:36.485 --> 37:37.786
You know, uh. Just for safety.

37:37.788 --> 37:40.454
What? No, no, no wait...
what? Why? It was good,

37:40.456 --> 37:41.489
we're gonna go with it.

37:41.491 --> 37:43.056
Why'd you even ask
me then? That's my opinion.

37:43.058 --> 37:44.092
It could have
been cleaner.

37:44.094 --> 37:48.029
It's a fucking snuff
film, dumb-dumb. Come on.

37:48.031 --> 37:53.000
Oh, this is important. Our
victim is checking out the room,

37:53.002 --> 37:55.936
testing her restraints,
trying to make sense of what is

37:55.938 --> 37:59.541
happening. She has hope that
she can escape. This is where

37:59.543 --> 38:04.112
the audience is right there with
her in the fucked up situation.

38:04.114 --> 38:04.945
Red Vine?

38:04.947 --> 38:06.915
I'm good.

38:06.917 --> 38:09.717
You know um, you don't have
to use that voice right now.

38:09.719 --> 38:15.926
Would you say that to Daniel
Day? Besides, it's showtime.

38:30.040 --> 38:33.741
You're probably
wondering who we are.

38:33.743 --> 38:37.078
Please, don't hurt me!
Please, don';t hurt me!

38:37.080 --> 38:41.549
As long as you tell
me, where the diamonds are.

38:41.551 --> 38:44.585
Diamonds? I... I don't know
anything of any diamonds!

38:44.587 --> 38:46.119
- I know.
- I swear!

38:46.121 --> 38:48.255
I'm fucking with you.

38:51.694 --> 38:53.795
Why are you filming this?

38:53.797 --> 38:55.697
Oh you'll know soon enough.

38:55.699 --> 38:57.931
Please don't kill me.
Please don't kill me,

38:57.933 --> 38:59.933
I don't want to
die! Please don't kill me.

38:59.935 --> 39:04.271
Everyone dies.
Not everyone truly lives.

39:04.273 --> 39:07.007
Is that... is that Braveheart?

39:07.009 --> 39:09.844
Are you kidding me?

39:09.846 --> 39:17.585
The truth is, that we've been
hired by a multi-international

39:17.587 --> 39:25.192
syndicate ring known as, The
Fellowship, to produce a certain

39:25.194 --> 39:31.900
kind of film. And you, my
dear, have the grave misfortune

39:31.902 --> 39:33.668
of being the star.

39:33.670 --> 39:34.802
Why me?

39:34.804 --> 39:37.938
You caught somebody's eye.

39:37.940 --> 39:40.007
Is it someone I know?

39:40.009 --> 39:43.777
It... it... it may... we're
not given all the details.

39:43.779 --> 39:47.982
We're just told the who,
the where, and the when.

39:47.984 --> 39:50.050
You don;t have
to do this, please.

39:50.052 --> 39:51.786
I haven't seen
your faces. Please,

39:51.788 --> 39:53.121
please just let
me go, please!

39:53.123 --> 39:54.721
We could.

39:55.891 --> 39:58.596
Oh, God!

39:59.763 --> 40:01.228
What are you gonna do to me?

40:01.230 --> 40:08.136
Well, as you can see
from this assortment of... tools,

40:09.806 --> 40:17.844
at our disposal. We can do
just about anything we want.

40:17.846 --> 40:21.014
Can't we, Mr. President?

40:21.016 --> 40:23.721
Yes we can!

40:24.753 --> 40:30.592
Tell me, my dear. Have
you ever been hunting?

40:30.594 --> 40:34.329
Animals? No, I'm a vegetarian!

40:34.331 --> 40:35.596
Of course she is.

40:35.598 --> 40:40.300
Well do you
see the hook on this blade?

40:40.302 --> 40:48.675
It'll allow me to remove
your skin without damaging it,

40:48.677 --> 40:53.780
and without harming your meat.

40:53.782 --> 40:58.786
We have this in case a
client would like to wear you,

40:58.788 --> 41:05.793
or eat you, or eat
you while wearing you.

41:05.795 --> 41:10.632
Oh, my God, that doesn't make
any sense. I don't understand.

41:10.634 --> 41:12.333
That doesn't make any sense!

41:12.335 --> 41:14.768
Yeah, that's,
that's not very clear...

41:14.770 --> 41:16.003
What? It's very clear.

41:16.005 --> 41:18.072
I don't know how I can make it
any clearer. I feel like I just

41:18.074 --> 41:19.306
laid it out very clearly.

41:19.308 --> 41:21.308
No! It's not clear
at all! I don't get it.

41:21.310 --> 41:22.543
It's quite confusing.

41:22.545 --> 41:24.779
It's not confusing at all. He
has the option. He can wear you,

41:24.781 --> 41:27.081
eat you, and the
third option is to do both.

41:27.083 --> 41:28.181
They can't do both.

41:28.183 --> 41:28.715
Yes, they... they...

41:28.717 --> 41:30.018
No! It... they can't!

41:30.020 --> 41:31.253
You're very stressed, so...

41:31.255 --> 41:33.054
I just think that you should
be kind of clear about what you...

41:33.056 --> 41:34.322
I don't get it! I don't get it!

41:34.324 --> 41:36.290
You're ruining it. Shut up! Cut.

41:36.292 --> 41:37.692
Okay.

41:40.096 --> 41:42.996
Agh! Damn it Dominic!
What the fuck was that?

41:42.998 --> 41:46.134
Sorry. I just... I thought
the verbiage was a little confusing.

41:46.136 --> 41:47.701
I mean we need to
make sure the audience

41:47.703 --> 41:48.770
understands what
you're saying right?

41:48.772 --> 41:51.405
You're right. You're
right. We're making a movies.

41:51.407 --> 41:53.974
Maybe just a... a hand
signal next time will suffice.

41:53.976 --> 41:55.143
Okay, great.

41:55.145 --> 41:58.012
That was great by
the way. "Yes we can!"

41:58.014 --> 41:59.681
Thanks.

41:59.683 --> 42:02.186
Okay, moving on, uh...

42:12.996 --> 42:15.163
Mmm, you feel that?

42:15.165 --> 42:17.868
Yeah.

42:19.069 --> 42:21.168
Come on.

42:21.170 --> 42:23.040
Okay.

42:32.848 --> 42:35.016
Hello...

42:35.018 --> 42:38.251
Are you gonna bark
all day little doggie?

42:39.255 --> 42:42.223
Or you gonna bite?

42:42.225 --> 42:50.331
Well here I am, stuck
in the middle with you.

42:50.333 --> 42:51.965
This can't be real.

42:51.967 --> 42:55.837
Oh, do you hear that, Mr.
President? She doesn't think

42:55.839 --> 42:59.773
that this is real.

42:59.775 --> 43:05.049
Well my dear, is this
real enough for you?

43:07.282 --> 43:08.215
Dresden!

43:10.453 --> 43:13.154
Ow, cut... don't...

43:15.023 --> 43:17.958
I... I'm... I'm worried
about the continuity.

43:18.895 --> 43:20.393
Ow! Don't!

43:20.395 --> 43:22.496
Oh no... Dresden?

43:24.333 --> 43:27.134
Ahhh.

43:27.136 --> 43:31.471
It's all right if you, feel a
certain attraction to your

43:31.473 --> 43:35.009
captor... it's called
the Nightingale effect.

43:35.011 --> 43:40.947
Uh... do you mean
Stockholm syndrome?

43:40.949 --> 43:42.983
That's... that's what I said.

43:42.985 --> 43:47.087
Okay. Okay.
Okay, okay, okay, sorry!

43:47.089 --> 43:48.255
I know what I said!

43:48.257 --> 43:50.257
Okay.

43:50.259 --> 43:58.132
I can do to you whatever
I want. I have total control.

43:58.134 --> 44:03.436
I have all the
power. It feels so good.

44:03.438 --> 44:05.038
I've known
girls like you...

44:05.040 --> 44:06.306
Ow!

44:06.308 --> 44:07.440
...my entire life.

44:07.442 --> 44:09.076
No! No!

44:11.313 --> 44:12.212
They have the whole world...

44:12.214 --> 44:13.014
What are you doing man?

44:13.016 --> 44:15.483
...tied around
their little finger.

44:15.485 --> 44:17.418
You're nothing but a failure.

44:17.420 --> 44:19.052
Stop!

44:19.054 --> 44:20.087
- Cold, desolate...
- Robert De Niro! Robert De Niro! Robert De Niro! Robert De Niro!

44:20.089 --> 44:23.023
- ...never getting what you deserve!
- Dresden!

44:23.025 --> 44:24.025
What?!

44:24.027 --> 44:26.460
A word in private, please?

44:28.831 --> 44:30.598
Arghh!

44:33.536 --> 44:34.634
What now?

44:34.636 --> 44:36.570
Don't you think you were
over acting a little bit?

44:36.572 --> 44:38.271
And... and what's with all
the hatred towards women?

44:38.273 --> 44:42.175
Again, Dominic, it's a
fucking real, fake snuff film!

44:42.177 --> 44:45.012
No man, your head
was somewhere else.

44:45.014 --> 44:46.614
You almost cut
her fucking finger off..

44:46.616 --> 44:51.355
It has to look real, doesn't it?

44:59.929 --> 45:01.529
Are you having second thoughts?

45:01.531 --> 45:04.030
Am I having second thoughts?
Yeah. And... and third thoughts

45:04.032 --> 45:06.433
and fourth thoughts and fifth
thoughts. I don't know, man.

45:06.435 --> 45:09.003
I just... I th... I think we may
be in some deep shit here.

45:09.005 --> 45:10.637
It doesn't matter now, all
right? We're already in it, it's

45:10.639 --> 45:11.639
too late. Can't go back.

45:11.641 --> 45:13.474
This has gone too far!

45:13.476 --> 45:15.409
You... you need to calm down.

45:15.411 --> 45:16.444
I don't think I can do this.

45:16.446 --> 45:24.585
Dominic, are you gonna
fuck this up for me? Huh?

45:24.587 --> 45:26.186
You see this?

45:28.257 --> 45:30.157
Everything that
I've done, all this.

45:30.159 --> 45:34.295
The begging, the humiliation?
I didn't do it just for me.

45:34.297 --> 45:37.134
I did it for us.

45:38.567 --> 45:41.270
Haven't I always
taken care of you?

45:44.107 --> 45:46.909
Don't you trust
me, baby brother?

45:50.346 --> 45:54.181
I trust you.

45:54.183 --> 46:00.253
Good. Good. Moving on?
Still have a lot to do.

46:00.255 --> 46:03.391
Just promise me you
won't use the chainsaw?

46:03.393 --> 46:06.360
Okay!

46:06.362 --> 46:08.496
Or the samurai sword.

46:08.498 --> 46:14.168
I'm not gonna fuckin' butcher
her! We need her to do PR!

46:17.572 --> 46:19.005
Here we go.

46:19.007 --> 46:19.706
Shit! She's getting out!

46:19.708 --> 46:22.442
No, no, no, no, no. Calm down.

46:22.444 --> 46:24.478
I loosened her restraints
when I was standing over her.

46:24.480 --> 46:25.478
Why?

46:25.480 --> 46:30.183
Trust me. Sit back and
watch the story unfold.

46:30.185 --> 46:32.987
Ah this is great.

46:32.989 --> 46:34.554
Exactly what we need now...

46:34.556 --> 46:37.991
...more suspense,
more action, more tension...

46:37.993 --> 46:38.759
What if she gets out?

46:38.761 --> 46:40.628
Mmm. Doesn't
matter, all right?

46:40.630 --> 46:42.529
This place is
locked down air tight.

46:42.531 --> 46:46.300
Do not you worry.
All right, get your camera.

46:48.471 --> 46:51.271
Now, first thing she's gonna
do is try to find a way out.

46:51.273 --> 46:54.342
But after she sees the doors
are locked, she's gonna try to...

46:54.344 --> 46:56.610
Dresden, it looks like
she's coming straight for us.

46:56.612 --> 46:58.279
You're seeing things.

46:58.281 --> 46:59.646
Augh!

47:01.384 --> 47:04.351
Ugh.

47:04.353 --> 47:06.020
I got her! I got her!

47:09.525 --> 47:12.425
Robert De Niro!
Robert De Niro!

47:12.895 --> 47:14.594
Ahh!

47:17.699 --> 47:18.733
Kill Bill.

47:18.735 --> 47:21.038
Great reference.

47:29.746 --> 47:31.311
I'm afraid to
ask what's in there.

47:31.313 --> 47:32.380
Dog's blood.

47:32.382 --> 47:33.581
Like, real dog's blood?

47:33.583 --> 47:35.449
Nothing but the best.

47:43.692 --> 47:44.791
You didn't...

47:44.793 --> 47:47.527
That thing was
driving me fucking nuts.

47:47.529 --> 47:49.130
You've lost your mind.

47:49.132 --> 47:50.563
For the sake of
cinema, little brother.

47:51.366 --> 47:52.699
What are you
going to do with it?

47:52.701 --> 47:54.335
Just a little water-boarding.

47:54.337 --> 47:57.170
What? That's insane!
She could get really sick.

47:57.172 --> 47:59.373
Remember when Uncle Dave
took us hunting? We drank blood

47:59.375 --> 48:00.407
straight from the buck.

48:00.409 --> 48:02.710
That was pristine
Minnesota wilderness blood.

48:02.712 --> 48:05.378
This is mangy
Hollywood HIV blood.

48:05.380 --> 48:06.313
You really need to stop

48:06.315 --> 48:07.480
and think about
what you say sometimes.

48:07.482 --> 48:10.284
I'm not the one who wants
to water-board this poor girl

48:10.286 --> 48:11.351
with fucking dog's blood.

48:11.353 --> 48:13.520
She's an actress. All
actresses are willing to get

48:13.522 --> 48:16.157
a little wet
for fame. Trust me.

48:16.159 --> 48:17.757
Dresden.

48:17.759 --> 48:19.759
We can call... we can go
to a pay-phone right now

48:19.761 --> 48:23.431
and we can call the cops, and we
can walk away from this! We can...

48:23.433 --> 48:24.598
Shit! She's waking up.

48:24.600 --> 48:32.239
Fuck. What are you guys doing?

48:32.241 --> 48:37.078
What are you doing?!

48:38.081 --> 48:43.583
You are one tough
bitch, I'll give you that.

48:43.585 --> 48:46.589
Whatever you're thinking
about doing, don't do it.

48:50.560 --> 48:51.858
I'm gonna enjoy breaking you.

48:51.860 --> 48:54.462
No! No! Don't, don't,
don't do this! Don't do this!

48:54.464 --> 48:55.663
Don't do this! Don't!

48:55.665 --> 48:57.565
- I don't know about this, Dresden.
- Don't!

49:04.840 --> 49:09.342
Jesus. Okay-okay.
That's enough!

49:09.344 --> 49:10.344
Dresden!

49:15.418 --> 49:17.750
Tasty? Probably
not for a vegetarian.

49:17.752 --> 49:20.487
Fuck you!

49:20.489 --> 49:24.657
That's enough, man. Enough!
That's enough, man!

49:24.659 --> 49:25.893
Stop!

49:25.895 --> 49:27.628
What the fuck!?

49:29.165 --> 49:30.098
I said enough!

49:30.100 --> 49:31.132
What the hell do
you think you're doing?

49:31.134 --> 49:33.601
You're scaring me,
Dresden, taking it too far.

49:33.603 --> 49:40.306
You shut up, and do as
you're told. I'm tired...

49:40.308 --> 49:44.712
of your dead weight,
tired of your cowardice.

49:52.388 --> 49:54.288
Argh!

49:54.290 --> 49:58.192
You little brat! Eat
your face! Eat your own face!

50:03.398 --> 50:06.402
Robert De Niro! Robert
De Niro! Robert De Niro!

50:07.369 --> 50:10.339
Time out. Time out.

50:12.641 --> 50:15.442
I'm calling mom!

50:25.654 --> 50:32.759
What's fucking
wrong with you two?

50:32.761 --> 50:35.462
He's my brother.

50:35.464 --> 50:36.931
Yeah, well he
treats you like shit.

50:36.933 --> 50:38.965
Don't say that.

50:38.967 --> 50:41.237
Aaagh!

50:45.507 --> 50:47.208
Fuck!

50:47.210 --> 50:48.909
Listen, please?

50:48.911 --> 50:51.779
Please? I know you don't
want do this. Please, just help

50:51.781 --> 50:53.413
me out of here, please?

50:53.415 --> 50:54.715
He's all I've got.

51:00.389 --> 51:02.922
Dresden. Dresden, even
when your family doesn't believe in

51:02.924 --> 51:07.927
the path that you've chosen.
You must always stay the course.

51:07.929 --> 51:10.396
That's right, I'm
talking directly to

51:10.398 --> 51:13.266
you, Dresden Winters.

51:13.268 --> 51:15.536
If I'm not around,
he gets into trouble.

51:15.538 --> 51:18.371
Well,
what would you call this?

51:21.844 --> 51:24.878
Don't you want your own sitcom?

51:24.880 --> 51:29.516
Success is not only within
reach, it's also your destiny.

51:31.020 --> 51:32.253
It's show-time.

51:36.025 --> 51:39.425
However you
think this is gonna end...

51:39.427 --> 51:42.596
it's gonna be so much worse.

51:45.433 --> 51:49.770
Sorry about that Mr. President.
Things got a little off track.

51:56.679 --> 52:02.049
Let's just uh, chalk it up to
a little unfiltered passion.

52:02.051 --> 52:06.623
On both of our parts.

52:08.023 --> 52:14.295
Don't worry, my dear.
This will all be over soon.

52:14.297 --> 52:15.462
Upsie-daisie.

52:23.272 --> 52:26.674
I'm gonna
fucking kill you.

52:26.676 --> 52:29.375
Please. Tell me
what you'd really...

52:29.377 --> 52:31.712
Oh stop with the whole
maniacal killer act, okay?

52:31.714 --> 52:35.315
It is painful. I'd
rather you two just kill me.

52:35.317 --> 52:36.516
We've been hired by a...

52:36.518 --> 52:39.320
By an elitist billionaire team
called the Fellowship of the

52:39.322 --> 52:40.954
Ring? Well, if they're so
fucking special, how come

52:40.956 --> 52:43.556
they hired
you two morons?

52:43.558 --> 52:46.893
Hey Dominic, Is
that camera even on? No?

52:47.763 --> 52:48.829
How did she know my name?

52:48.831 --> 52:51.864
Fucking imbeciles!

52:51.866 --> 52:53.266
I think you
better stop laughing.

52:53.268 --> 52:56.436
Or what?! What?
You've already established that

52:56.438 --> 52:57.837
you're gonna torture
and then you're gonna

52:57.839 --> 53:00.574
kill me. So what else is there?

53:00.576 --> 53:04.378
We can still inflict
a lot more pain on you.

53:04.380 --> 53:05.545
Yes we can!

53:05.547 --> 53:08.514
Will you shut the fuck up!
You've already said that line!

53:09.784 --> 53:12.786
Stop laughing! Stop laughing!

53:13.723 --> 53:16.123
Whoo!

53:16.125 --> 53:19.492
You know what guys? I'm done
playing the victim. That part of

53:19.494 --> 53:22.029
the movie is over,
'cause this is one joke.

53:22.031 --> 53:23.563
I still see the
fear in your eyes.

53:23.565 --> 53:24.297
Do you?

53:24.299 --> 53:25.766
Do you wanna see fear?

53:25.768 --> 53:28.067
Oh please, show me.

53:30.438 --> 53:31.838
You promised no chainsaw!

53:33.476 --> 53:34.675
God damn it, Dominic!

53:38.080 --> 53:39.679
I'm a real fucking artist!

53:39.681 --> 53:41.014
You're a cover band.

53:41.016 --> 53:41.715
Stop criticizing me!

53:50.393 --> 53:51.958
You're not afraid to die, huh?

53:51.960 --> 53:55.161
No, actually to be honest with
you, I never really have been.

53:55.163 --> 53:56.596
Let's put that to the test.

53:56.598 --> 54:00.601
Dresden, don't!

54:00.603 --> 54:01.268
Do it.

54:01.270 --> 54:02.735
There's one bullet in here.

54:02.737 --> 54:05.706
You dickless,
fucking pussy! Do it!

54:05.708 --> 54:06.139
Don't!

54:06.141 --> 54:07.840
Do it! Do it!

54:07.842 --> 54:09.009
- Do it! Do it!
- Don't!

54:09.011 --> 54:10.444
- Do it! Do it!
- Stop!

54:10.446 --> 54:11.712
- Do it! Do it! Do it!
- Stop!

54:11.714 --> 54:13.014
Do it!

54:13.016 --> 54:16.717
Jesus Christ!

54:16.719 --> 54:19.119
I'm done.

54:19.121 --> 54:20.554
This isn't over.

54:20.556 --> 54:22.989
I can't wait.

54:33.034 --> 54:34.201
What the fuck is wrong with you?

54:34.203 --> 54:36.969
Relax, all right? There's
like, what, like a ten percent

54:36.971 --> 54:37.904
chance the gun goes off?

54:37.906 --> 54:41.474
One in six. It's
a lot more like twenty.

54:41.476 --> 54:42.875
Let's figure out what
the exact percentage is.

54:42.877 --> 54:44.744
I feel like this is important.
That's it!

54:44.746 --> 54:45.813
Forget it!

54:45.815 --> 54:47.681
It's over, we're done!

54:47.683 --> 54:48.849
What are you talking
about? We're not done

54:48.851 --> 54:50.050
shooting the movie.

54:50.052 --> 54:52.985
This was never about a movie,
Dresden. This was about you

54:52.987 --> 54:56.690
and what you think you deserve.
You know I-I've looked up to you

54:56.692 --> 55:00.893
my entire life. But now I see
you for what you really are.

55:00.895 --> 55:04.900
You're a fucking bully with
no friends, and it's sad.

55:09.003 --> 55:13.739
I think your f... your head's
all fucked up again, Dresden?

55:13.741 --> 55:14.808
You wanna see fucked up? No!

55:14.810 --> 55:17.009
We'll see fucked up! No!
I won't let you!

55:20.949 --> 55:22.516
What the...

55:22.518 --> 55:24.851
Where is she?

55:24.853 --> 55:26.253
Oh, fuck.

55:27.723 --> 55:28.989
Hello boys.

55:30.192 --> 55:31.458
How did you get out?

55:31.460 --> 55:35.628
Your fuck-face brother left all
the sharp toys right next to me.

55:35.630 --> 55:37.663
Fuck.

55:39.235 --> 55:42.101
Jennifer! Hey!

55:42.103 --> 55:43.302
Hi!

55:43.304 --> 55:47.574
We wanted to share something
with you. You got the part!

55:47.576 --> 55:49.675
- Congratulations! Whoo!
- Obviously...

55:49.677 --> 55:51.677
We were never gonna kill you.

55:51.679 --> 55:53.746
Yeah, yeah, yeah! No,
no, this is all about the movie.

55:53.748 --> 55:56.016
Oh! So I should be happy!

55:56.018 --> 55:56.750
Yeah!

55:56.752 --> 55:58.684
- Oh! Oh, okay!
- Yeah!

55:58.686 --> 56:01.688
You should be ecstatic. I
mean, your performance has been...

56:01.690 --> 56:02.588
- So good.
- ...amazing.

56:02.590 --> 56:05.058
Shut the fuck up!
I figured out it was

56:05.060 --> 56:07.159
you two morons a
long time ago, okay.

56:07.161 --> 56:08.328
Why don't you just
put the gun down?

56:08.330 --> 56:11.965
Don't you fucking test me,
sunshine. I've obviously had a

56:11.967 --> 56:15.636
really bad, fucking day.

56:15.638 --> 56:19.840
Now move or I'll put a
bullet in your brother's face.

56:19.842 --> 56:22.543
There's only one bullet
in that gun. It's only really

56:22.545 --> 56:23.175
like a ten percent chance...

56:24.313 --> 56:27.114
Twenty. Twenty it's a lot
closer to twenty, I... I had

56:27.116 --> 56:28.614
time to do the math in my head.

56:28.616 --> 56:29.349
Just do what she says.

56:42.764 --> 56:45.032
Line up facing the wall.

56:45.034 --> 56:46.065
That wall?

56:46.067 --> 56:48.904
Right in front of you.

56:50.906 --> 56:56.909
You know, we were gonna let you
in on it. After, we had what we

56:56.911 --> 57:00.913
needed. You should see
the footage that we have.

57:00.915 --> 57:07.688
I mean, this is gonna
make you a fucking star.

57:07.690 --> 57:13.092
I'm sorry. I-I misinterpreted
the entire situation, right?

57:13.094 --> 57:15.128
We should go find a diner,

57:15.130 --> 57:18.197
and figure this out
over coffee and waffles.

57:18.199 --> 57:20.266
Well, I'm not a fan of waffles.

57:20.268 --> 57:21.802
Ah!

57:21.804 --> 57:23.235
Ah! Sh...

57:23.237 --> 57:26.105
I think you broke my nose.

57:26.107 --> 57:31.143
Jennifer, that really
was the plan. We swear.

57:31.145 --> 57:34.081
I believe that's what
you thought, Dominic.

57:34.083 --> 57:38.184
But your brother over
here, I'm not so sure.

57:38.186 --> 57:42.322
All right, he's a little
fucked in the head, I know.

57:42.324 --> 57:44.023
Not a killer.

57:44.025 --> 57:45.125
- He's not.
- Okay,

57:45.127 --> 57:50.163
I will admit that my head
may have gotten a little

57:50.165 --> 57:51.264
bit too big.

57:51.266 --> 57:52.498
Oh jeez, you think?

57:52.500 --> 57:57.737
And I-I may have crossed over a
few boundaries. But it was all

57:57.739 --> 58:04.244
in the heat of the moment. I
mean, it was pure beauty, baby.

58:04.246 --> 58:07.213
We're making a film here.

58:07.215 --> 58:11.351
Look, I promise you we're
not bad people, we're

58:11.353 --> 58:14.987
just a little
over-overambitious.

58:14.989 --> 58:17.056
I tried to tell
him. I really did!

58:17.058 --> 58:19.960
You're not innocent in
this either. You're a

58:19.962 --> 58:24.163
follower and that's pathetic.

58:24.165 --> 58:29.168
You know, there's only
one bullet in that gun.

58:29.170 --> 58:33.940
What are you gonna
do? Shoot both of us?

58:33.942 --> 58:38.311
No, ace. Just you.

58:38.313 --> 58:43.817
Here's what we're gonna
do. You guys turn around,

58:43.819 --> 58:47.219
close your eyes,
and count to ten.

58:47.221 --> 58:48.454
One.

58:48.456 --> 58:49.422
No peaking!

58:49.424 --> 58:51.324
Two.

58:51.326 --> 58:56.962
Three. Four. Five.

58:56.964 --> 58:59.965
Six. Seven...

59:02.404 --> 59:04.806
Eight, nine, ten.

59:05.273 --> 59:09.177
What the fuck?

59:10.011 --> 59:13.779
You'd better
hide, before I find you!

59:13.781 --> 59:14.848
Let's get the fuck out of here.

59:14.850 --> 59:16.382
Yeah.

59:19.987 --> 59:22.422
This place is like a giant
maze! The doors are all locked!

59:22.424 --> 59:23.889
We need to hide somewhere, fast!

59:23.891 --> 59:24.491
Right there!

59:32.467 --> 59:35.802
In here! In here!

59:35.804 --> 59:37.837
Ah! She looked crazy!

59:37.839 --> 59:40.040
Yeah. I think it's safe
to say she's pretty upset.

59:40.042 --> 59:41.174
Yeah, you're right.
You're right, we need

59:41.176 --> 59:42.208
to try and reason with her...

59:42.978 --> 59:44.444
Oh, my God!

59:44.446 --> 59:45.344
Holy shit!

59:45.346 --> 59:47.246
Run!

59:51.953 --> 59:55.121
Where'd she go? Where'd she go?

59:55.123 --> 59:56.389
Okay, I think we lost her.

59:56.391 --> 59:58.324
Wait, wait, wait,
wait! Stop! Stop!

59:58.326 --> 01:00:00.860
Can we, please, just stop
and talk about the fact that

01:00:00.862 --> 01:00:02.429
she just cut off all
my fucking fingers!

01:00:02.431 --> 01:00:05.331
Well just... just
keep it elevated.

01:00:05.333 --> 01:00:07.867
Better. Alright, we need
to find a door right now.

01:00:07.869 --> 01:00:09.001
Argh!

01:00:09.003 --> 01:00:10.971
The window!

01:00:16.145 --> 01:00:17.210
Can't reach.

01:00:21.884 --> 01:00:23.016
Shit!

01:00:23.018 --> 01:00:25.018
Run! Run, run, run, run, run!
Run! Run!

01:00:32.226 --> 01:00:35.561
- Whoa!
- Jorge! Jorge! Jorge! - Boys! Boys!

01:00:35.563 --> 01:00:37.297
Dresden, what
happened to your hand?!

01:00:37.299 --> 01:00:38.398
Shhh!

01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:39.565
Our lead actress
is trying to kill us.

01:00:39.567 --> 01:00:42.469
Actress? This is why I
don't trust nothing that bleeds

01:00:42.471 --> 01:00:45.572
for five days and
lives. What happened?

01:00:45.574 --> 01:00:47.407
We'll explain it later,
can you get us out of here?

01:00:47.409 --> 01:00:48.675
I can get you out of here.

01:00:48.677 --> 01:00:52.112
Nobody's going to hurt you anymore!

01:00:52.114 --> 01:00:57.083
You hear that, little girl?
You try to cut me, I cut you!

01:00:57.085 --> 01:00:59.018
You mess with my boys...

01:01:04.226 --> 01:01:05.592
I'm so wet.

01:01:13.235 --> 01:01:17.369
Oh, my God. Did
you see what she did to Jorge?

01:01:17.371 --> 01:01:19.505
Oh man, he was the best!

01:01:19.507 --> 01:01:21.608
Just a guy's guy.

01:01:23.411 --> 01:01:30.116
Warriors! Come out to play-ay!

01:01:30.118 --> 01:01:39.259
Warriors.

01:01:39.261 --> 01:01:43.163
We know those don't work.

01:01:43.165 --> 01:01:46.967
We can get out through
there. Let's go, come on.

01:01:51.239 --> 01:01:53.038
Dude!

01:01:57.346 --> 01:01:59.445
Bingo.

01:02:02.049 --> 01:02:02.983
What do we do?

01:02:02.985 --> 01:02:04.516
I don't know, there's
gotta be a way out!

01:02:04.518 --> 01:02:06.319
There's not, man.
I looked everywhere.

01:02:06.321 --> 01:02:08.154
- Ah, Ah.
- Whoa, Whoa.

01:02:08.156 --> 01:02:09.088
- What happened, what happened?
- I'm cramping.

01:02:09.090 --> 01:02:10.357
I'm cramping! Oh!

01:02:10.359 --> 01:02:10.924
Are you serious?

01:02:10.926 --> 01:02:12.893
- Yes! Yes!
- Dammit.

01:02:12.895 --> 01:02:13.927
You gotta rub it out, Dom!

01:02:13.929 --> 01:02:15.661
- Right now?
- Yeah, or I'm fucked.

01:02:15.663 --> 01:02:16.529
- Come on!
- Dammit.

01:02:16.531 --> 01:02:18.998
All right, all right,
come on. Get it?

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.000
God.

01:02:20.002 --> 01:02:22.601
Watch these movies,
where people run around

01:02:22.603 --> 01:02:24.237
all night and,
miraculously, no one

01:02:24.239 --> 01:02:26.538
cramps up! It's
fucking bullshit.

01:02:26.540 --> 01:02:27.574
Ugh, that's good.

01:02:27.576 --> 01:02:30.076
Told you man, should
have been drinking water.

01:02:30.078 --> 01:02:32.612
When? Did you take
a water break tonight?

01:02:32.614 --> 01:02:35.681
Yeah. Always do.

01:02:38.987 --> 01:02:42.389
Really? Is this
really happening?

01:02:42.391 --> 01:02:45.391
I had a cramp.

01:02:45.393 --> 01:02:49.628
What do you think? Want
to try and get past me?

01:02:49.630 --> 01:02:50.329
Can't we just talk?

01:02:50.331 --> 01:02:52.398
No! You talk too fucking much!

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:55.467
Shut the fuck up
for one fucking second!

01:02:55.469 --> 01:02:56.201
I do?

01:02:56.203 --> 01:02:58.103
You do, yeah.

01:02:58.105 --> 01:03:01.641
But I'll tell you
what, I'll make ya a deal.

01:03:01.643 --> 01:03:05.612
You guys can come downstairs
with me, play a little game...

01:03:05.614 --> 01:03:06.679
...or simply jump.

01:03:12.321 --> 01:03:14.454
What do ya think?

01:03:14.456 --> 01:03:16.989
I think I can make it.

01:03:16.991 --> 01:03:20.092
What are you? Crazy?
We'll break both our legs.

01:03:20.094 --> 01:03:24.197
You probably will,
but I think I'll make it

01:03:24.199 --> 01:03:26.166
I'm getting
bored over here, guys.

01:03:26.168 --> 01:03:27.936
Ahh...

01:03:29.337 --> 01:03:32.271
All right.

01:03:32.273 --> 01:03:34.541
We've taken her down
before, we'll do it again.

01:03:34.543 --> 01:03:38.610
I don't know man, she kind
of fucked us up every time.

01:03:38.612 --> 01:03:41.313
All right, look, we'll
play her little game and then

01:03:41.315 --> 01:03:43.616
when the time is
right, we take her down.

01:03:43.618 --> 01:03:45.518
One! Two!

01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:47.520
Okay! Okay! Okay,
we're coming with you.

01:03:47.522 --> 01:03:49.592
What the fuck?

01:03:52.259 --> 01:03:54.393
All right, we're gon...
we're gonna go with you.

01:03:54.395 --> 01:03:55.262
We do it my way.

01:03:55.264 --> 01:03:57.630
Wait, why... why'd
you wear the taser?

01:03:57.632 --> 01:04:00.099
Because you're a
disease, and I'm the cure.

01:04:00.101 --> 01:04:00.867
Hey that's...

01:04:05.007 --> 01:04:05.505
Is that Cobra?

01:04:05.507 --> 01:04:06.306
Yeah, how was it?

01:04:06.308 --> 01:04:07.440
It's kind of
appropriate actually...

01:04:43.244 --> 01:04:45.779
I'm disappointed.
For someone that

01:04:45.781 --> 01:04:50.616
talks about working out so much,
you're not in very good shape.

01:04:50.618 --> 01:04:52.384
I have a sweet tooth.

01:04:52.386 --> 01:04:55.521
We need to talk about adding
more protein to your diet.

01:04:55.523 --> 01:04:58.224
Kind of personal isn't it?

01:04:58.226 --> 01:04:59.291
Ah!

01:04:59.293 --> 01:05:03.596
You have no idea how
personal this is gonna get.

01:05:03.598 --> 01:05:10.103
Did you know that
boys have a G-spot? Right...

01:05:10.105 --> 01:05:11.737
Ah! Ah! Please don't. Please.

01:05:11.739 --> 01:05:15.507
Why? Why fucking not?
You water-boarded me with

01:05:15.509 --> 01:05:18.311
fucking dog's blood,
you fucking asshole.

01:05:18.313 --> 01:05:20.079
Why the fuck shouldn't I?

01:05:20.081 --> 01:05:24.650
I'm sorry.

01:05:24.652 --> 01:05:30.558
I have all the control, all
the power, and it feels so good.

01:05:36.331 --> 01:05:38.264
What are you doing?

01:05:40.168 --> 01:05:47.706
We are going to play a
little, oh... medium-sized game.

01:05:47.708 --> 01:05:48.875
I don't want to play a game.

01:05:48.877 --> 01:05:50.375
Really? Why not?

01:05:50.377 --> 01:05:51.511
- No, you can't do that.
- Why?

01:05:51.513 --> 01:05:52.645
Why?! Why can't I do this?

01:05:52.647 --> 01:05:53.246
- It's not right.
- Why?

01:05:53.248 --> 01:05:55.447
It's not right?
Yes!

01:05:55.449 --> 01:05:59.886
It's not right for you.
But it's okay for a woman?

01:05:59.888 --> 01:06:03.889
You two fuckers broke into my
home, kidnapped me for your

01:06:03.891 --> 01:06:11.331
fucking video. But when
I do it to you, it's not right?

01:06:11.333 --> 01:06:17.603
Oh man, guys. Every
movie, every TV show...

01:06:17.605 --> 01:06:23.643
...it's like there's women being tortured and raped and... and you

01:06:23.645 --> 01:06:29.549
guys fucking love it. You sickos
fucking love that shit, why?

01:06:29.551 --> 01:06:32.152
Why do you love it? Huh? Why?

01:06:32.154 --> 01:06:33.753
Please, Jennifer,
we didn't wanna...

01:06:33.755 --> 01:06:37.322
Shut up, pussy!

01:06:37.324 --> 01:06:39.425
I'm gonna show you how
to make a real snuff film

01:06:43.697 --> 01:06:44.797
Action.

01:06:53.674 --> 01:06:58.578
Dominic, I'm gonna cut you
down. But if you try and run

01:06:58.580 --> 01:07:05.817
away or do anything stupid, I'm
gonna shoot your brother, okay?

01:07:05.819 --> 01:07:06.920
Good.

01:07:12.793 --> 01:07:15.561
Pick it up! Go ahead.

01:07:18.699 --> 01:07:19.866
What do you want me to do?

01:07:19.868 --> 01:07:22.438
Oh.

01:07:24.438 --> 01:07:29.909
I'm sure you can
think of something.

01:07:32.313 --> 01:07:32.945
Oh no way!

01:07:32.947 --> 01:07:33.712
Yes.

01:07:33.714 --> 01:07:34.413
No.

01:07:34.415 --> 01:07:35.415
No!

01:07:35.417 --> 01:07:36.083
No, no, no, no, no.
Yes. Yes.

01:07:36.085 --> 01:07:40.587
- No! No!
- Yes. Yes! Do it!

01:07:40.589 --> 01:07:41.621
No.

01:07:42.824 --> 01:07:46.458
I don't want to play
this game anymore.

01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:51.998
But you have to. Sweet
Dominic, I'll tell you what.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:57.704
If you do this I'll let
you live. I promise.

01:07:57.706 --> 01:08:00.405
My brother?

01:08:00.407 --> 01:08:04.911
Yeah, fine. Okay, but he leaves
with half his digits and no cock

01:08:04.913 --> 01:08:07.579
and balls. That is if he doesn't
bleed to death on his way to the

01:08:07.581 --> 01:08:10.953
hospital, which I think
you have a pretty good shot.

01:08:14.255 --> 01:08:15.154
Ah, f...

01:08:15.156 --> 01:08:16.823
Don't do it. Don't
listen to her, Dom.

01:08:16.825 --> 01:08:18.058
No. No.

01:08:18.060 --> 01:08:22.528
Dominic, look at that fuck-face,
really? You think that for one

01:08:22.529 --> 01:08:25.665
second he wouldn't do it to you?
I bet my left tit he wouldn't

01:08:25.667 --> 01:08:26.866
even fucking hesitate.

01:08:26.868 --> 01:08:28.301
Never, Dominic.

01:08:28.303 --> 01:08:31.537
Please. It takes five
minutes with the two

01:08:31.538 --> 01:08:33.872
of you to know he
wouldn't even blink.

01:08:33.874 --> 01:08:35.841
No, that's not true.

01:08:35.843 --> 01:08:39.278
Are you sure?
Dominic, are you sure?

01:08:39.279 --> 01:08:39.979
No, no.

01:08:39.981 --> 01:08:42.015
You don't look sure, sweetie.

01:08:42.017 --> 01:08:44.884
Ok. Ok, ok.

01:08:48.455 --> 01:08:50.323
Don't li... don't listen
to her. Don't listen to her.

01:08:50.325 --> 01:08:54.661
Dominic! Do you think
that any of this was for you?

01:08:54.662 --> 01:08:55.895
It was about us!

01:08:55.897 --> 01:08:59.866
Yeah? Do you think that if for
some moronic reason you guys got

01:08:59.868 --> 01:09:02.502
away with all this, he would
give you any fucking credit?

01:09:02.504 --> 01:09:03.368
Executive producer!

01:09:03.370 --> 01:09:04.737
Do you? Nothing!

01:09:04.738 --> 01:09:05.837
At least producer.

01:09:05.839 --> 01:09:08.408
Are you sure about that,
Dominic? Do you think so?

01:09:11.612 --> 01:09:16.349
Dominic, sweet Dominic.
Come on, save yourself.

01:09:16.350 --> 01:09:17.515
You didn't want any of this.

01:09:17.518 --> 01:09:18.484
Don't listen to her, Dominic.

01:09:18.486 --> 01:09:20.685
She's-she's just
twisting your thoughts up.

01:09:20.688 --> 01:09:24.791
Am I? Or am I
finally telling the truth?

01:09:24.792 --> 01:09:27.827
Stop fucking with my head!

01:09:27.828 --> 01:09:29.095
No.

01:09:29.096 --> 01:09:30.496
Forget it.

01:09:32.433 --> 01:09:33.433
I'm done.

01:09:33.435 --> 01:09:35.966
Okay.

01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:40.872
Suck it.

01:09:40.874 --> 01:09:44.344
What?

01:09:44.345 --> 01:09:49.448
Suck it. Either
chop it off or suck it.

01:09:49.450 --> 01:09:52.417
No. No, this has
gone far enough I...

01:09:53.053 --> 01:09:53.920
Jesus Christ!

01:09:53.921 --> 01:09:55.721
Yes you can. Yes you can!

01:09:55.723 --> 01:09:56.288
One?

01:09:56.290 --> 01:09:57.056
You can suck my dick!

01:09:57.058 --> 01:09:58.056
Two.

01:09:58.058 --> 01:09:58.890
Just please...

01:09:58.892 --> 01:10:00.091
Stop!

01:10:00.093 --> 01:10:01.927
How many fucking times do I
have to do this before I blow

01:10:01.929 --> 01:10:03.762
your brother's
fucking head off, huh?!

01:10:03.764 --> 01:10:04.930
Dominic, get over
here and suck my dick!

01:10:05.601 --> 01:10:07.833
Okay! Okay! Okay, just stop!

01:10:07.835 --> 01:10:11.970
Come on! I do it all
the time. It's not so bad.

01:10:11.972 --> 01:10:12.904
Please Dominic.

01:10:12.906 --> 01:10:14.107
You might like it.

01:10:14.109 --> 01:10:18.010
Ok, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

01:10:18.012 --> 01:10:22.748
Baby brother, suck it.
Please suck my dick.

01:10:22.750 --> 01:10:24.015
Please.

01:10:24.017 --> 01:10:25.051
Yes you can.

01:10:25.053 --> 01:10:26.752
You can.

01:10:26.754 --> 01:10:28.488
Ahh!

01:10:28.490 --> 01:10:33.059
Put my dick in your mouth. You
can do it. Come on, you can do

01:10:33.061 --> 01:10:39.064
it, bud. There you go, you can
do this, there you go. Put my

01:10:39.066 --> 01:10:44.670
dick in your mouth, just the
tip. Don't even think about it,

01:10:44.672 --> 01:10:50.109
it's just... it's just a dick. It
could be any dick just...

01:10:50.111 --> 01:10:51.577
DOMINIC Aw shit! I swear to God.

01:10:51.579 --> 01:10:52.478
You made your choice.

01:10:53.681 --> 01:10:56.783
Fuck, Dresden! This is your
lucky day! I'm not really good

01:10:56.785 --> 01:10:58.951
at math, but I'm
pretty sure this is it.

01:10:58.953 --> 01:11:00.987
I'm sorry.

01:11:00.989 --> 01:11:05.824
Dresden, this is the price of
fame. Are you ready? I'm gonna

01:11:05.826 --> 01:11:09.429
make all your dreams come true.
We can tell the world, media

01:11:09.431 --> 01:11:12.732
loves that shit. You'll probably
end up with your own show.

01:11:12.734 --> 01:11:14.966
- Dominic, you suck my dick right now!
- Dominic,

01:11:14.968 --> 01:11:16.101
are you ready?

01:11:16.103 --> 01:11:17.002
- Are you ready?
- Put my dick in your mouth!

01:11:17.004 --> 01:11:18.938
On the count of three.
One!

01:11:18.940 --> 01:11:20.206
Put that sword down!

01:11:20.208 --> 01:11:23.109
- A-two!
- Put that sword down!

01:11:23.111 --> 01:11:24.109
Three!

01:11:24.111 --> 01:11:25.644
I'm gonna kill you,
you motherfucking bitch!

01:11:28.150 --> 01:11:36.189
I can't do it. I can't...
I can't do it, I'm sorry.

01:11:36.191 --> 01:11:37.689
Oh!

01:11:37.691 --> 01:11:38.858
I can't do it.

01:11:38.860 --> 01:11:45.665
Oh! God, that was great! Oh
Dominic, Dominic, it's okay.

01:11:45.667 --> 01:11:51.537
I knew you couldn't do
it. Kick me the sword.

01:11:55.008 --> 01:12:02.715
Guys, I mean, I don't know about
you, but I think we just created

01:12:02.717 --> 01:12:08.186
something really, really
special. I feel great about it,

01:12:08.188 --> 01:12:17.766
I'm inspired, I'm excited. So
why don't we take five, regroup,

01:12:18.766 --> 01:12:21.904
and prepare for what's to come.

01:12:23.271 --> 01:12:25.837
Oh, God, we gotta find a way out
of here, man, she's gonna be back

01:12:25.839 --> 01:12:31.844
soon. I couldn't suck your dick,
come on! Come on, let's go! Come

01:12:31.846 --> 01:12:32.545
on, we gotta keep going!

01:12:32.547 --> 01:12:33.712
- No, man.
- Come on, come on!

01:12:33.714 --> 01:12:35.014
- Come on!
- I'm not going.

01:12:35.016 --> 01:12:36.248
I'm not going anywhere man.

01:12:36.250 --> 01:12:37.216
What do you mean?

01:12:37.218 --> 01:12:39.252
Done. It's over.

01:12:39.254 --> 01:12:42.121
No. No, no no. We
gotta go, come on!

01:12:42.123 --> 01:12:44.756
Dominic, did you hear me man?

01:12:44.758 --> 01:12:50.229
We're trapped, there's no way
out. I fucked this up man.

01:12:50.231 --> 01:12:54.266
We're still in this, dude. This
is the part of the movie where

01:12:54.268 --> 01:12:58.104
the guys band together
and they defeat the villain.

01:12:58.106 --> 01:13:03.009
Like in Butch Cassidy
and the Sundance Kid?

01:13:03.011 --> 01:13:07.913
They die at the end of
that one, but yeah. Yes.

01:13:07.915 --> 01:13:09.881
Well what are we gonna do?

01:13:09.883 --> 01:13:12.851
I don't know.
You're the thinker.

01:13:12.853 --> 01:13:20.626
Come on, you
always have great ideas.

01:13:20.628 --> 01:13:21.793
Jorge's keys.

01:13:21.795 --> 01:13:23.328
Oh fuck.

01:13:49.356 --> 01:13:52.291
All right, it... his keys
are probably in his pocket.

01:13:52.293 --> 01:13:54.025
We gotta say
something first, man.

01:13:54.027 --> 01:13:55.060
What? No! We don't have time!

01:13:55.062 --> 01:13:57.997
We have to, he was our friend.

01:13:57.999 --> 01:14:00.135
Okay, all right.

01:14:03.605 --> 01:14:04.770
Well?

01:14:04.772 --> 01:14:07.139
You're the wordsmith! It's
better if you say something.

01:14:07.141 --> 01:14:10.242
Ok, ok, alright.

01:14:10.244 --> 01:14:18.317
God, bless this man who enjoyed
spending time with his bros down

01:14:18.319 --> 01:14:24.689
at his favorite bar, Load. As
well as spending time with his

01:14:24.691 --> 01:14:34.703
many male companions, here in
his warehouse. He enjoyed The

01:14:35.803 --> 01:14:44.976
Color Purple, both the movie
and just the color, purple. He's

01:14:44.978 --> 01:14:51.716
survived by his beloved
Maltipoo: Bubbles. Amen.

01:14:51.718 --> 01:14:52.685
Amen.

01:14:52.687 --> 01:14:54.819
Okay, I said the
prayer, you get the keys.

01:14:54.821 --> 01:14:57.390
Ah!

01:14:57.392 --> 01:14:58.256
Careful.

01:14:59.727 --> 01:15:01.793
- Oh! Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

01:15:01.795 --> 01:15:08.067
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh,
God! She cut off his penis!

01:15:08.069 --> 01:15:10.235
Ok, you still
have to get his keys.

01:15:10.237 --> 01:15:11.369
Ah fuck it, fuck!

01:15:11.371 --> 01:15:14.140
Hurry.

01:15:17.812 --> 01:15:21.046
There's nothing. There's
nothing. She must've taken them.

01:15:21.048 --> 01:15:22.982
We're dealing with
one smart cookie here.

01:15:22.984 --> 01:15:25.984
You think, Dresden? When
did you put that together?

01:15:25.986 --> 01:15:28.119
I'm just piecing
it together now.

01:15:28.121 --> 01:15:33.958
We know she can fight. She's
not afraid to kill. She seems to be

01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:39.965
tactical. Her warfare is both
physical and psychosocial.

01:15:39.967 --> 01:15:43.034
It must be something
from her past. She wanders

01:15:43.036 --> 01:15:48.407
from town to town
trying to escape that past.

01:15:48.409 --> 01:15:51.743
You're describing John
Rambo. It's not helping.

01:15:51.745 --> 01:15:55.046
Come on, let's try and find another way out.

01:15:55.048 --> 01:15:56.181
The fire alarm!

01:15:56.183 --> 01:15:57.049
We should've
pulled it a long time ago.

01:15:57.051 --> 01:16:03.088
Let's pull it now.
Come on.

01:16:03.090 --> 01:16:04.489
You go that way.

01:16:04.491 --> 01:16:07.695
Where is it?

01:16:09.896 --> 01:16:11.963
Dresden, over here I found it!

01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:15.467
Fuck! What the fuck!

01:16:15.469 --> 01:16:17.235
I wouldn't do
that if I were you.

01:16:17.237 --> 01:16:21.940
- Ah!
- Oh come on, g... give... give us a chance!

01:16:22.843 --> 01:16:24.476
Ugh!

01:16:24.478 --> 01:16:26.746
On your knees.

01:16:26.748 --> 01:16:28.913
- Now.
- Please, if you... if you... if you'll just let me explain.

01:16:28.915 --> 01:16:32.318
Sure. Just stick out
your tongue first.

01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:33.019
I don't understand.

01:16:33.021 --> 01:16:36.354
Stick out your fucking tongue!

01:16:36.356 --> 01:16:39.026
Now.

01:16:39.794 --> 01:16:40.960
There you go.

01:16:43.164 --> 01:16:44.162
Go ahead.

01:16:47.134 --> 01:16:49.301
I'm not getting it, what?

01:16:49.303 --> 01:16:51.369
We... gonna make your movie!

01:16:51.371 --> 01:16:52.304
What!?

01:16:54.107 --> 01:16:55.507
I'm just... I'm not getting this.

01:17:00.815 --> 01:17:02.014
Oh, wait.

01:17:02.016 --> 01:17:04.884
Uh huh. Dresden, what was that?

01:17:04.886 --> 01:17:07.353
Just get it over with.

01:17:07.355 --> 01:17:14.225
Aw, did I break you already?
I haven't even gotten started.

01:17:14.227 --> 01:17:15.426
What are you?

01:17:15.428 --> 01:17:19.098
Let's just say this
isn't my first rodeo.

01:17:19.100 --> 01:17:23.002
You've made a snuff film before?

01:17:23.004 --> 01:17:26.538
- Oh.
- I think that she means that she's killed before, Dresden.

01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:28.306
Thank you, Dominic.

01:17:28.308 --> 01:17:31.577
You're a killer?
Like, a serial killer?

01:17:31.579 --> 01:17:36.148
Well there's more to it than
that but, in a nutshell, yeah.

01:17:36.150 --> 01:17:40.519
All those bodies showing up
without their penises, that...

01:17:40.521 --> 01:17:44.556
that was you. Wh... why do
you want all those penises?

01:17:44.558 --> 01:17:46.826
It's my trademark.

01:17:48.062 --> 01:17:49.095
And now you die.

01:17:49.097 --> 01:17:50.296
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

01:17:50.298 --> 01:17:56.435
Wait! Wait, this is... this is
crazy! Jennifer, can we just

01:17:56.437 --> 01:18:02.474
kneel down and just kind of
step back and... and think about

01:18:02.476 --> 01:18:08.581
all this. I mean, you're a
killer, but you know we... we

01:18:08.583 --> 01:18:12.184
fuckin' kidnapped you and
we tortured you and shit.

01:18:12.186 --> 01:18:16.889
So, I mean I think that
makes us all pretty fucked up.

01:18:16.891 --> 01:18:23.028
But maybe, maybe we're just
artists. And I think that we've

01:18:23.030 --> 01:18:25.930
got something really special. I
mean, we've got great footage,

01:18:25.932 --> 01:18:28.466
you've got some amazing
footage. Why don't we just sit

01:18:28.468 --> 01:18:32.904
down and see what we've got.

01:18:35.008 --> 01:18:37.275
Yeah, sure.

01:18:37.277 --> 01:18:38.210
Really?

01:18:46.152 --> 01:18:47.452
Are you a lefty?

01:18:47.454 --> 01:18:49.421
Cause otherwise,
life's gonna fuckin' suck.

01:18:49.423 --> 01:18:51.593
I am now.

01:18:53.526 --> 01:18:56.060
No, but for real,
I am right-handed.

01:18:56.062 --> 01:18:57.296
Oops.

01:18:57.298 --> 01:19:00.498
And out of all the actresses in
this fucking town, we pick the

01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:02.902
one who is an actual psychopath.

01:19:04.504 --> 01:19:06.971
No offense, but you
are a serial killer.

01:19:06.973 --> 01:19:07.973
Nah, no, none taken.

01:19:07.975 --> 01:19:09.140
It's so bad ass.

01:19:09.142 --> 01:19:11.676
Oh, it's simple. You go after
these slimy producers that

01:19:11.678 --> 01:19:15.514
prey on young, naive
actresses, that's about it.

01:19:15.516 --> 01:19:16.649
Huh.

01:19:16.651 --> 01:19:19.284
You know, why didn't you
just hire me? It's a much more

01:19:19.286 --> 01:19:22.253
sensible solution,
don't you think?

01:19:22.255 --> 01:19:23.956
He didn't think you could do it.

01:19:23.958 --> 01:19:25.157
What?

01:19:25.159 --> 01:19:25.791
Yeah. No, give
a believable performance.

01:19:25.793 --> 01:19:26.359
Come on, Dom! That's not...

01:19:26.361 --> 01:19:27.059
You fucking kidding me?

01:19:27.061 --> 01:19:29.461
No that's not... that's not fair!

01:19:29.463 --> 01:19:30.630
- You didn't think I was a good enough actress?
- No, no, look.

01:19:30.632 --> 01:19:35.000
I believe it was Keanu Reeves
or Stephen Dorff who said,

01:19:35.002 --> 01:19:38.170
the trick to good acting
is creating a situation

01:19:38.172 --> 01:19:42.474
in which you don't
have to act at all.

01:19:42.476 --> 01:19:44.976
But I've been acting since you
two broke into my apartment.

01:19:44.978 --> 01:19:45.677
Really?

01:19:45.679 --> 01:19:47.645
Yeah.

01:19:47.647 --> 01:19:49.113
You are a good actress, shit.

01:19:49.115 --> 01:19:51.216
Thank you.

01:19:51.218 --> 01:19:53.719
I gotta say, guys.

01:19:53.721 --> 01:19:59.524
I think that this is gonna
be a great fucking movie.

01:20:01.294 --> 01:20:02.060
She stabbed me!

01:20:02.062 --> 01:20:02.929
What?

01:20:07.601 --> 01:20:09.335
Couldn't agree more.

01:20:09.337 --> 01:20:13.505
Guys, I'm sorry.

01:20:13.507 --> 01:20:18.210
Good news is, I made you famous!

01:20:20.114 --> 01:20:23.247
I'm sorry, Dom.
I think you're right,

01:20:23.249 --> 01:20:28.487
I am f... fucked up in the head
a bit. You get some help now.

01:20:28.489 --> 01:20:30.521
I think it's too late.

01:20:30.523 --> 01:20:34.025
It's never too
late, baby brother.

01:20:34.027 --> 01:20:36.260
You think they'll
make a movie about us?

01:20:36.262 --> 01:20:38.663
Movie of the Week.

01:20:38.665 --> 01:20:41.065
I hope they get
someone good to play me.

01:20:41.067 --> 01:20:47.739
There's only one man with the
competence, the skillfulness...

01:20:47.741 --> 01:20:50.442
...the gift.

01:20:50.444 --> 01:20:55.215
FPJ. Freddy...

01:21:00.254 --> 01:21:03.021
...he's my man.

01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:15.501
Hey guys!

01:21:15.503 --> 01:21:18.302
Which dick wants to go first?

01:21:27.380 --> 01:21:33.085
Are you rolling?

01:21:36.356 --> 01:21:37.823
It's show-time!

01:21:37.825 --> 01:21:40.562
Ahh! Help me!

01:21:42.329 --> 01:21:45.631
Your resistance is futile.

01:21:45.633 --> 01:21:49.701
Help me! Help me!

01:21:49.703 --> 01:21:54.473
Our victim is checking out,
testing her restraints, trying

01:21:54.475 --> 01:21:59.677
to make sense of
this fucked up situation.

01:21:59.679 --> 01:22:01.579
Where do you think you're...

01:26:31.852 --> 01:26:35.354
Well, it will be great
for you to come on this project.

01:26:35.356 --> 01:26:37.021
Yeah, well, say hi
to Michelle for me.

01:26:37.023 --> 01:26:40.294
All right. All right, take care, man.
Be safe.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:51.836
Jennifer? Jennifer Sellers?

01:26:51.838 --> 01:26:54.405
Yep. That's me.
