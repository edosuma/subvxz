Hiro from my facility.

Uh, yes.
Yes, she talked.

31:34.320 --> 31:36.288
Malina knows about Odessa,
she's on her way.

31:36.440 --> 31:38.169
Do you have a lead
on where she is now?

31:38.240 --> 31:40.208
That girl cannot connect
with her brother.

31:40.280 --> 31:42.044
We are closing in.
Yes.

31:42.480 --> 31:43.766
Taylor Kravid is here

31:43.880 --> 31:46.360
and this guy tried to pass
himself off as Erica.

31:46.440 --> 31:47.930
That is who you
should be focusing on

31:48.000 --> 31:49.843

trying to infiltrate us.

33:12.560 --> 33:13.641

33:19.800 --> 33:20.881
Let's go.

33:31.200 --> 33:32.611
This is bad.

33:32.840 --> 33:34.808
We have to do something.

33:53.800 --> 33:55.131
It's safer in your car.

I wouldn't go in there
if I were you.

I mean, I don't work here

34:40.320 --> 34:41.844
and it doesn't look
like you do, either.

Hero Truther.

34:56.120 --> 34:57.531
Jose told me
something about them.

34:59.880 --> 35:01.689
But how can we be
sure you're not lying?

35:01.760 --> 35:04.286
I'm here looking for our
leader, Micah Sanders.

35:04.360 --> 35:06.840
Now please, stop pointing
your guns at me.

35:07.000 --> 35:09.765
- We can't trust her. - Why would
I warn you about the guards?

35:09.840 --> 35:11.683
Something tells me we're
here for the same thing

35:11.760 --> 35:13.364

Yeah, we are.

35:19.880 --> 35:21.086
How you doing today, Micah?

35:30.880 --> 35:33.167
Erica Kravid is up to something.

35:37.480 --> 35:39.926
She's got a list of everyone
going to the future.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.162
I need you to find it for me.

35:46.080 --> 35:48.162
I have to know that I'm
on that list, Micah.

I'll leave you here?

No, I think we trust
each other now.

I should stay.

No, go back and contact Harris

and then find his sister.
