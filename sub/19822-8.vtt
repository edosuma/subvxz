Is there something I can
help you boys with?

11:10.671 --> 11:13.204
Yeah, as a matter of fact, there...

11:13.273 --> 11:15.140
There is, Mister...

11:15.208 --> 11:17.175
Browning. Browning, yes.

11:17.244 --> 11:19.711
We are looking for the...

11:19.780 --> 11:20.845
the magpie.

11:25.318 --> 11:28.086
The magpie, you say?

11:28.155 --> 11:29.821
Well, you've come to the right place.

11:29.890 --> 11:34.526
Pica Pica, the name of my
store, is Latin for magpie.

11:36.963 --> 11:39.264
Great! That's the last clue!

11:39.332 --> 11:42.233
Let's go tell the scoutmaster
we won the scavenger hunt!

11:42.302 --> 11:43.568
What?

11:43.637 --> 11:44.636
Thanks, Mr. Browning!

11:44.705 --> 11:45.670
What are you talking about?

11:45.739 --> 11:46.971
I was just getting
somewhere with that guy.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.740
Did you see the way he
looked when I said magpie?

11:48.809 --> 11:49.941
I have to check something at home.

11:50.010 --> 11:51.443
Better be important.

11:57.484 --> 11:59.250
I knew it. They're identical.

12:02.322 --> 12:05.557
This is the same egg as
the one at Pica Pica.

12:05.625 --> 12:07.158
So? Big deal, there's more than one.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.393
No, there isn't.

12:08.462 --> 12:10.328
The Imperial eggs are one of a kind.

12:10.397 --> 12:13.331
Each one is unique, which means...

12:13.400 --> 12:17.135
Either this one or the one
from the shop is fake.

12:17.204 --> 12:18.336
Bingo.

12:18.405 --> 12:19.971
There it is.

12:25.445 --> 12:28.880
Looks like we found our fugazi.

12:28.949 --> 12:31.216
Our what? Fugazi.

12:31.284 --> 12:33.852
Dude, come on, don't you
watch crime movies?

12:33.920 --> 12:35.086
Uh...

12:35.155 --> 12:36.121
It means fake.

12:36.189 --> 12:37.355
Ah.

12:37.424 --> 12:39.924
Fugazi. Yeah.

12:39.993 --> 12:42.927
♪♪

12:50.737 --> 12:51.870
Put this on.

12:51.938 --> 12:53.671
It's kind of against the rules,

12:53.740 --> 12:55.507
but it'll give you a sense
of what it feels like,

12:55.575 --> 12:58.109
how people look at you as a cop.

13:01.548 --> 13:02.480
Oh...

13:02.549 --> 13:04.015
I can feel the authority.

13:04.084 --> 13:07.285
It's not the jacket that
gives you the authority.

13:07.354 --> 13:08.987
I know.

13:09.055 --> 13:10.855
But it looks good on me.

O-M-G...

13:21.968 --> 13:23.201
Come on.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.136
Kelly, I didn't say you
could touch anything.

13:25.205 --> 13:29.941
I want to know everything about him.

13:30.010 --> 13:31.876
It smells just like him.

13:31.945 --> 13:37.749
Yeah, him and every other
17-year-old in the world.

13:37.818 --> 13:40.752

13:42.989 --> 13:43.922
(bell ringing) Brrng-brrng.

13:43.990 --> 13:44.923
(laughs)

13:51.298 --> 13:53.431
Eric and Kate have files
on every piece of work

13:53.500 --> 13:55.400
in their art collection.

13:55.468 --> 14:00.772
Dates, background on
the artist, et cetera.

14:00.841 --> 14:02.207
Ah.

14:02.275 --> 14:04.008
Got it. (phone chimes)

14:07.781 --> 14:11.149
Now,<i> this</i> is interesting.

14:11.218 --> 14:12.217
Something about the egg?

14:12.285 --> 14:13.585
No, listen to this.

14:13.653 --> 14:19.357
The art thief and forger known
as the Magpie has struck again.

14:19.426 --> 14:21.726
The "Chush" Diamond,

14:21.795 --> 14:25.163
a priceless treasure of
the Leningrad Museum

14:25.232 --> 14:28.466
was discovered to be a fake.

14:28.535 --> 14:33.471
A microscopic investigation
revealed the engraved letters

14:33.540 --> 14:35.039
MGP.

14:35.108 --> 14:37.876
MGP, like the egg.

14:37.944 --> 14:39.077
I think it's time we pay our friend

14:39.145 --> 14:40.078
Mr. Browning another visit.

14:40.146 --> 14:41.946
I don't think he'll be overjoyed

14:42.015 --> 14:44.849
at us barging in and accusing
him of being a criminal.

14:44.918 --> 14:46.651
We're not accusing him of anything.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.386
The note said MGP would help us.

14:48.455 --> 14:53.958
What if he won't?

14:54.027 --> 14:56.928
I think I know a way to convince him.

14:56.997 --> 14:57.929
(Kelly) Hi, fashion fanatics.

14:57.998 --> 14:59.697
Today's Kelly special update

14:59.766 --> 15:02.834
is about one thing that
never goes out of style.

15:02.903 --> 15:05.436
Hot guys! I know!

15:05.505 --> 15:08.840
Hey, Kel, you know what you should do?

15:08.909 --> 15:10.909
Have me film you from back here,

15:10.977 --> 15:13.344
that way all your followers
can get a real sense

15:13.413 --> 15:15.680
of what a hot guy's
room is like, right?

15:15.749 --> 15:16.681
I know!

15:16.750 --> 15:17.682
Great idea, Jess.

15:17.751 --> 15:19.951
You know me. Jess.

15:20.020 --> 15:21.152
I'm gonna go in the hall,

15:21.221 --> 15:24.155
that way I can get the whole
man cave in the shot.

15:24.224 --> 15:26.124
When I say "action," turn around.

15:26.192 --> 15:27.592
Okay.

15:28.962 --> 15:29.894
Action!

Hi, fashion fanatics!

door right this minute.

15:39.773 --> 15:41.005
There you are. What did you find?

15:41.074 --> 15:42.006
Something that's gonna help us.

15:42.075 --> 15:43.007
We gotta go. Okay.

15:43.076 --> 15:44.075
Tell me everything on the way.

15:44.144 --> 15:45.143
I'm coming, too!

15:45.211 --> 15:47.245
Uh-uh. It could be dangerous.

15:47.314 --> 15:50.214
Then we better come along
to protect you. (laughs)

15:50.283 --> 15:51.849
(banging on door, Kelly screaming)

15:51.918 --> 15:55.520
Besides, it's better than staying here.
(Kelly) Help! Daniel! Help!

15:55.588 --> 15:57.188
Daniel! Help!

15:57.257 --> 15:58.389
Wait.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.124
Where's my phone?

16:00.193 --> 16:01.993
(screaming)

16:02.062 --> 16:03.661
Help me!

16:09.269 --> 16:12.837
This is actually one of the most
important parts of the job.

16:12.906 --> 16:16.274
What? Getting blisters on
our feet doing nothing?

16:16.343 --> 16:18.409
We're not doing nothing.

16:18.478 --> 16:21.245
We're being here.

16:21.314 --> 16:26.284
Just being here makes people
feel safe and it deters crime,

16:26.353 --> 16:28.252
and I really like having
a personal connection

16:28.321 --> 16:30.188
with the people on my beat.

16:30.256 --> 16:31.956
It sounds pretty cool,

16:32.025 --> 16:33.925
but I bet it doesn't compare
to the adrenaline rush

16:33.994 --> 16:36.361
you get when something
big goes down, right?

16:36.429 --> 16:39.297
Right? Something big goes down?

16:39.366 --> 16:42.433
Yeah. (cell phone ringing)

16:46.406 --> 16:48.339
Hey, man, look at my uniform.

16:48.408 --> 16:50.241
How cool is this? This me or what?

16:50.310 --> 16:52.243
It's got the black, it's
got the yellow stripes.

16:52.312 --> 16:53.378
Look at the... Look at the logo, dude,

16:53.446 --> 16:54.645
look at the logo, how cool is that?

16:54.714 --> 16:56.914
I'm right here. Put the
phone down, calm down.

16:56.983 --> 16:58.216
We need your help, let's go.

16:58.284 --> 16:59.584
I can't leave, I'm on duty.

16:59.652 --> 17:00.952
No, you're not. Okay,
this is important.

17:01.021 --> 17:02.353
It could help us get
Erik and Kate back.

17:02.422 --> 17:03.421
Well, let me just give this back.

17:03.490 --> 17:04.955
No, no, no, leave it on, leave it on.

17:05.025 --> 17:08.092
I can't steal from the cops,
especially not from Simone.

17:08.161 --> 17:11.429
You're not stealing it, you're
already borrowing it, come on.

17:11.498 --> 17:14.265
You're just gonna borrow
it a little further away.

17:14.334 --> 17:15.266
Daniel!

17:21.741 --> 17:23.107
(Max) We're back.

17:27.047 --> 17:29.013

17:29.082 --> 17:31.115
So you won your little scavenger hunt.

17:31.184 --> 17:33.051
That's not what I'm talking about.

17:33.119 --> 17:36.721
This is what I'm talking about.

17:36.790 --> 17:38.656
Dude. Oh! Sorry.

17:38.725 --> 17:41.125
Wrong picture, this is
what I'm talking about.

17:41.194 --> 17:42.360
Look familiar?

17:42.429 --> 17:43.928
'Course it does.

17:43.997 --> 17:45.696
You even signed your own work.

17:45.765 --> 17:47.398
MGP, Magpie.

17:47.467 --> 17:49.700
Oh, don't even think about
making a run for it.

17:49.769 --> 17:52.537
There's a cop outside.

17:52.605 --> 17:54.338
I wonder what kind of
promotion they would give him

17:54.407 --> 17:56.274
for bringing in the notorious Magpie?

17:58.545 --> 18:00.178
What do you want from me?

18:01.915 --> 18:03.448
To offer you a job.

18:03.516 --> 18:05.450
A job?

18:05.518 --> 18:06.984
What kind of job and who are you?

18:07.053 --> 18:08.553
We're the Hunters.

18:11.124 --> 18:14.692

Oh, gosh, I was just getting into it.

I don't know if I can handle
going back to civilian life now.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.980
Uh, this is yours, by the way.

18:36.049 --> 18:37.415
Is that the key to my room?

18:37.484 --> 18:38.683
What are you doing with it?

18:38.751 --> 18:41.519
I may have sort of
locked Kelly in there.

18:41.588 --> 18:43.287
You did what? Why?

18:43.356 --> 18:44.689
It's a long story.

18:44.757 --> 18:47.725
You better go make her
day and rescue her.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.293
Thanks a lot, Tess.

18:51.998 --> 18:53.998
(Browning) Listen, it was years ago

18:54.067 --> 18:57.568
that I broke into the Hunter
museum to steal the egg.

18:57.637 --> 19:01.839
The forgery I made was so they
wouldn't even know it was gone.

19:01.908 --> 19:06.844
They caught me red-handed,
but they didn't turn me in.

19:06.913 --> 19:11.649
Instead, Eric made me a
deal that changed my life.

19:13.453 --> 19:17.655
He said, if I would give
up my life of crime,

19:17.724 --> 19:20.791
they'd let me keep my freedom.

19:20.860 --> 19:23.561
Why, they even let me keep the egg.

19:23.630 --> 19:26.297
But why would they do that?

19:26.366 --> 19:27.398
Yeah.

19:27.467 --> 19:30.601
It's worth a fortune.

19:30.670 --> 19:34.739
Erik and Kate care more about people

19:34.807 --> 19:35.940
than they do fortunes.

19:37.911 --> 19:39.710
I guess they saw a talent in me

19:39.779 --> 19:42.980
that they didn't want me to
throw away by rotting in jail.

19:43.049 --> 19:46.918
Well, that's pretty nice of them.

19:46.986 --> 19:49.053
Now it's your chance
to return the favor.

19:49.122 --> 19:52.890
Anything. What can I do?

19:52.959 --> 19:54.158
How good are you with diamonds?

20:03.636 --> 20:05.770
O-M-G! Daniel!

20:08.508 --> 20:10.474
Hi. Let's get you home.

my God, oh, my God, hi!

She was locked in my room.

20:23.690 --> 20:24.789
What?

20:24.857 --> 20:28.693
Yeah, Jesse locked me
in there, bless her.

20:28.761 --> 20:29.794
I know!

20:29.862 --> 20:35.633
Whatever, just give me
the jacket back, Daniel!

20:35.702 --> 20:36.801
And who is this?

20:36.869 --> 20:38.002
Another uncle?

20:38.071 --> 20:40.871
No, he's a friend. No,
he's the handyman.

20:40.940 --> 20:44.542
And a handyman. And a
friend of Erik and Kate's.

20:44.611 --> 20:47.478
And what's this handyman
friend here to do?

20:47.547 --> 20:48.913
Fix the heating system.
Oh, fix the toilet.

20:50.283 --> 20:53.284
Uh, this old place, it
needs so many repairs.

20:53.353 --> 20:56.320
If it wasn't for our good
old handyman friend,

20:56.389 --> 20:58.289
uh, it would all fall apart.

20:58.358 --> 21:01.892
And does this handyman
friend have a name?

21:01.961 --> 21:05.263
Browning! You old sack of dirt!

21:05.331 --> 21:08.132
Rhinus, you smelly old goat!

21:08.201 --> 21:09.934
(both laughing)

21:10.003 --> 21:11.502
You still guarding museums?

21:11.571 --> 21:13.037
Well, not for the moment now,

21:13.106 --> 21:15.806
but I'm still keeping an
eye on you, old thief.

21:15.875 --> 21:16.807
Come on.

21:16.876 --> 21:19.644
(kids laughing nervously)

21:19.712 --> 21:21.345
Just so I got this straight,

21:21.414 --> 21:25.149
why did he just call your
uncle Casper Rhinus?

21:25.218 --> 21:28.386
And what did he mean by "thief"?

21:28.454 --> 21:30.588
What's going on here?

21:30.657 --> 21:34.692
Yeah, no more lies!

21:34.761 --> 21:35.760
In!

21:40.867 --> 21:42.133
