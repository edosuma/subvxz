I want her to be proud of me,
and I want to be a role model.

And I just want her to run out
on the stage and hug me

the most ultimate win for me.

35:37.846 --> 35:40.390
I feel like he may be
the best artist on Team Niall.

35:40.432 --> 35:43.018
It's just hard to go against
Huntley. Huntley is so good.

35:43.059 --> 35:44.936
I'm going to
the three-way knockout!

35:44.978 --> 35:46.980
Let's go, Team Niall!

35:47.022 --> 35:48.231
* I'm wanted *

35:48.273 --> 35:50.191
* Wanted *

35:50.233 --> 35:52.902
* Dead or alive *

35:52.944 --> 35:54.779
Every time he steps
on the stage,

35:54.821 --> 35:56.448
he never, ever
puts a foot wrong.

35:56.489 --> 35:58.867
And, as a coach,
that's exactly what I want.

35:58.908 --> 36:01.036
I'm shocked that you're not
already on the radio.

36:01.077 --> 36:02.912
The winner is Huntley.

36:02.954 --> 36:05.331
He can give emotion.
He can tell a story.
He's got a great voice.

36:05.373 --> 36:07.125
He's gonna go
really far in this.
I appreciate you.

36:07.167 --> 36:10.253
Daly: Now let's see how aspiring
pop artist Claudia B.

36:10.295 --> 36:11.880
made her way to Team Niall.

36:11.921 --> 36:13.506
Hi, everyone!

36:13.548 --> 36:18.178
At 14 years old,
I was in my first rock band.

36:18.219 --> 36:19.971
I studied jazz in college.

36:20.013 --> 36:23.391
As soon as I graduated,
I moved to Nashville.

36:23.433 --> 36:26.686
I gig at hotels,
some restaurants,

36:26.728 --> 36:30.065
but this is, by far, the biggest
opportunity I've gotten.

36:30.106 --> 36:35.362
* Oh, why? *

36:35.403 --> 36:41.826
* Oh, why? *

36:41.868 --> 36:44.204
That was such
a brave song choice.

36:44.245 --> 36:47.040
It makes me so excited to see
what you would do in the future.

36:47.082 --> 36:48.625
I feel like
I really understand

36:48.667 --> 36:50.460
where you're coming from
as an artist,

36:50.502 --> 36:52.879
and we could do a lot
of great things together.

36:52.921 --> 36:54.047
John Legend.

36:54.089 --> 36:55.924
[ Cheers and applause ]

36:55.965 --> 36:57.384
Yes!

36:57.425 --> 36:59.594
Claudia B. --
that was very unique.

36:59.636 --> 37:02.013
I could hear the blues
and jazz in her voice.

37:02.055 --> 37:03.723
And I was so jealous.

37:03.765 --> 37:05.141
Yes!

37:05.183 --> 37:07.185
Daly: Claudia brought
the house down in the battles.

37:07.227 --> 37:10.063
* The only boy
who could ever teach me *

37:10.105 --> 37:12.565
* Was the son of
a preacher man *

37:12.607 --> 37:14.109
* He was *

37:14.150 --> 37:15.610
* He was *

37:15.652 --> 37:20.323
* Oh, yes, he was *

37:20.365 --> 37:22.409
Whoo!

37:22.450 --> 37:24.119
How do y'all do this?!

37:24.160 --> 37:26.037
You're so talented.
You're so young.

37:26.079 --> 37:27.580
I'm just --
I don't get it.

37:27.622 --> 37:28.957
[ Laughs ]

37:28.998 --> 37:30.834
The winner of this battle
is Mara.

37:30.875 --> 37:33.753
[ Cheers and applause ]

37:33.795 --> 37:37.465
Daly:
We've got a steal!
No, no, no!

37:37.507 --> 37:40.260
John:
Claudia's showing us all the
different layers of her artistry

37:40.301 --> 37:41.845
and her musicianship,

37:41.886 --> 37:45.265
and Niall is making me
very jealous that I let her go.

37:45.306 --> 37:48.601
Thank you so much.
I'm so excited.
That was so good.

37:48.643 --> 37:50.770
I'm so excited. Thank you.
Your voice is incredible.

37:50.812 --> 37:53.606
Daly: And Claudia showed
a softer side in the knockouts.

37:53.648 --> 38:01.990
* Heart is drenched in wine *

38:02.991 --> 38:06.119
Daly: Whoa, whoa!
Gwen: Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh!

38:06.161 --> 38:08.038
We got a save!

38:08.079 --> 38:09.581
And a steal!

38:09.622 --> 38:11.416
I feel like
I really understand

38:11.458 --> 38:13.209
the style of music
that you want to do,

38:13.251 --> 38:15.295
and I feel like I can
really help you get there.

38:15.337 --> 38:17.547
Today we found out the record
you are gonna make.

38:17.589 --> 38:19.549
Mm-hmm.
Please
just stay with me.

38:19.591 --> 38:21.634
I haven't had enough time
with Niall,

38:21.676 --> 38:22.969
and I'm gonna stay
on Niall.

38:23.011 --> 38:25.430
I'm so happy
that I got to save Claudia B.

38:25.472 --> 38:27.057
She has come on so much

38:27.098 --> 38:29.267
since her first audition
up until this point,

38:29.309 --> 38:31.269
and I feel like
she's getting going now

38:31.311 --> 38:32.979
because we found her lane.

38:33.021 --> 38:34.773
Daly: Niall's next artist
came a long way

38:34.814 --> 38:36.608
to make it to the playoffs.

38:36.649 --> 38:37.984
Nini: I'm from Georgia.
[ Buzzer ]

38:38.026 --> 38:41.154
[ Laughs ]
The country of Georgia.

38:41.196 --> 38:43.823
Georgia has my heart
and my soul.

38:43.865 --> 38:45.575
I have my whole family there.

38:45.617 --> 38:48.161
We didn't really have,
like, electricity

38:48.203 --> 38:50.080
or, like, hot water.

38:50.121 --> 38:53.208
When I was 16, I decided
that I'd rather be a musician

38:53.249 --> 38:54.793
than do something else.

38:54.834 --> 38:57.462
I moved to New York City.
I didn't know where to go.

38:57.504 --> 39:00.882
So I actually ended up
being homeless for a few weeks.

39:00.924 --> 39:04.844
So I was just in the subway.
I slept in the train.

39:05.679 --> 39:07.472
[ Sniffles ]

39:07.514 --> 39:09.557
It was okay.
It wasn't terrible.

39:09.599 --> 39:11.643
But I just didn't want
to do it anymore.

39:11.685 --> 39:14.562
I want to make it
so my mom can say that

39:14.604 --> 39:17.273
like, you know,
"She went for a reason."

39:17.315 --> 39:20.193
* I see red *

39:20.235 --> 39:21.695
* Red *

39:21.736 --> 39:25.198
* Ohhh, red *

39:25.240 --> 39:26.408
Sing!

39:26.449 --> 39:29.327
* A gun to your head *

39:29.369 --> 39:34.290
* Head, to your head *

Whoo!

39:38.670 --> 39:40.588
[ Cheers and applause ]

39:40.630 --> 39:42.007
That was the best vocal
of the day,

39:42.048 --> 39:43.466
without a shadow
of a doubt.

39:43.508 --> 39:45.885
You've already given us,
like, a Grammys performance.

39:45.927 --> 39:47.554
Who do you pick
as your coach?

39:47.595 --> 39:49.806
Niall.
Yes!

39:49.848 --> 39:52.058
Nini is so good, dynamic.

39:52.100 --> 39:54.144
Her voice can do
just about anything she wants.

39:54.185 --> 39:56.688
She's got style.
She's got a point of view.

39:56.730 --> 39:58.189
She's very special.

39:58.231 --> 40:01.067
Daly: During the battles,
Nini continued to prove

40:01.109 --> 40:02.902
she was a force
to be reckoned with.

40:02.944 --> 40:04.487
It's a heart-wrencher.
Nini: Yeah.

40:04.529 --> 40:06.114
So make sure
you're telling that story

40:06.156 --> 40:07.866
in your individual
verses.

40:07.907 --> 40:09.743
* Lost inside *

40:09.784 --> 40:13.955
* Adorable illusion
and I cannot hide *

40:13.997 --> 40:15.665
* I'm the one you're using *

40:15.707 --> 40:18.001
* Please don't push me aside *

40:18.043 --> 40:20.253
* We could have
made it cruising *

40:20.295 --> 40:22.088
* Yeah, riding high *

40:22.130 --> 40:24.966
* On love's
true bluish light *

40:25.008 --> 40:27.886
Oh, my God!
That was so good!

40:27.927 --> 40:30.347
Niall is beating
his chair up.

40:30.388 --> 40:34.142
That was incredible. You sung
the roof off this place.

40:34.184 --> 40:36.936
We've got to know
who won this battle.

40:36.978 --> 40:38.646
Nini.

40:38.688 --> 40:40.899
Nini moving on
to the knockouts.

40:40.940 --> 40:42.317
Gwen: I think Nini
is really incredible.

40:42.359 --> 40:46.071
She has crazy stage presence.
She has attitude.

40:46.112 --> 40:48.782
I think that she's definitely
gonna be a threat to everybody,

40:48.823 --> 40:51.034
and she's for sure
going to the finale.

40:51.076 --> 40:55.080
Daly: Nini went to new heights
in the three-way knockouts.

* When you mess with us *

41:03.338 --> 41:05.340

It must be so fun to be you
and be able to sing like that.

41:08.635 --> 41:10.387
When you hit
those high notes,

41:10.428 --> 41:14.349
there's this, like, openness
and roundness to your voice

41:14.391 --> 41:15.975
that is, like, stunning.

41:16.017 --> 41:19.854
The winner of this knockout
is Nini.

41:19.896 --> 41:21.398
[ Cheers and applause ]

41:21.439 --> 41:25.735

it was just incredible.

41:25.777 --> 41:27.153
[ Laughs ]

41:27.195 --> 41:29.823
The tone of her voice
is so rocky but pure.

41:29.864 --> 41:32.325
She can take on any song
and smash it.

41:32.367 --> 41:35.370
But I feel like Nini is only
getting started right now.

41:35.412 --> 41:37.497
Heading into the playoffs,

41:37.539 --> 41:40.458
I've got so many great
storytellers on Team Niall.

41:40.500 --> 41:43.712
And once again,
Team Niall is the team to beat.

41:43.753 --> 41:45.338
It's the best team.

41:45.380 --> 41:48.925
And the winner is gonna be
on Team Niall this year.

* This is "The Voice" *

41:57.517 --> 41:58.727
Daly: Welcome back.

41:58.768 --> 42:00.562
Coach Gwen Stefani proved
right away

42:00.603 --> 42:04.399
that she was hungry
for another "Voice" victory.

42:04.441 --> 42:07.569
From the beginning,
Gwen was really stepping up.

42:07.610 --> 42:10.947
She refused to back down,
and she's so ready to win.

42:10.989 --> 42:13.241
Welcome to my show,
you guys.
Yeah, uh -- uh?

42:13.283 --> 42:16.870
Yeah! Well, Blake told me
that I'm the star now.

42:16.911 --> 42:17.954
I'm gonna fight hard.

42:17.996 --> 42:19.497
John: Alright.
I'm winning.

42:19.539 --> 42:20.749
Alright, Gwen.

42:20.790 --> 42:22.208
She's one of the greatest
rock/pop singers

42:22.250 --> 42:24.502
of many, many generations.

42:24.544 --> 42:27.213
But she's a silent assassin.

42:28.590 --> 42:30.342
She's so sweet, so lovely.

42:30.383 --> 42:33.845
But when she wants an artist,
she is very, very good.

42:33.887 --> 42:35.972
I've done all of the stuff
that you want to do.

42:36.014 --> 42:37.307
I want to mother you.

42:37.349 --> 42:39.267
She gives them
that great mama bear pitch

42:39.309 --> 42:41.102
where she'll tell them,
"I want to help you.

42:41.144 --> 42:42.562
I've been a girl
in this business."

42:42.604 --> 42:45.482

in so many ways,

43:01.873 --> 43:02.999

43:03.041 --> 43:04.292
But she also knows her stuff.

I could help you have

43:05.835 --> 43:08.046
your star shine
by yourself in front.

43:08.088 --> 43:10.382
I think that I'm good
at helping people

43:10.423 --> 43:12.926
find the actual emotion
of the song.

43:12.967 --> 43:15.303
Reba: She comes in with
what she can do

43:15.345 --> 43:16.763
to help coach and everything,
and I said,

43:16.805 --> 43:18.556
"Well, shoot,
I'd pick her, too."

and our peaches.

talented, and a good coach,

to the playoffs --

19-year-old Oklahoma City native
Tanner Massey.

Tanner: My parents always
told me that I could sing,

so they pushed me,
and it all started to take off.

* It kills me that your mind *

so worthless *

in your voice.

The dream is just
so alive in you.

I feel like I'm talking
to, you know,

44:24.998 --> 44:26.082
a younger version
of myself.

44:26.124 --> 44:27.375
There's a little
storyteller

44:27.417 --> 44:29.377
that we heard
in your performance.

44:29.419 --> 44:30.462
I pick Niall.

44:30.503 --> 44:32.297
Gwen: Tanner --
he went with Niall.

44:32.339 --> 44:34.215
He's just made the wrong choice.
It's fine.

44:34.257 --> 44:37.010
Tanner, I'm a mom.
I forgive you.

44:37.052 --> 44:39.888

with Tanner in the battles.

* ...she wants you
to see *

but she's always a woman to me *

44:48.229 --> 44:50.148
Beautiful!
When Tanner started,

44:50.190 --> 44:51.191
I was like, "Wait a minute."

I am dead in love with you.

You are just magical.

battles where I've been, like,

44:57.072 --> 44:59.032
really battling with myself,

44:59.074 --> 45:02.243

is Lennon.

John: He's so talented.
He's got charisma.

45:08.500 --> 45:11.086
I think Niall's gonna regret
letting Tanner go.

45:11.127 --> 45:13.254
Tanner is available to steal.

45:13.296 --> 45:14.714
And we've got a steal!

45:14.756 --> 45:17.258
We've got a second steal!

John also tried to steal him,
but mnh-mnh.

beautiful singer

of vocal style.

his skills in the knockouts.

You're saying
what we're feeling.

...to be able to hop
into somebody else's song

45:49.040 --> 45:51.126
that, sadly, you had
to leave Team Niall.

45:51.167 --> 45:52.919

there's regrets.

is gonna be Tanner.

quite the formidable opponent

Daly: Let's see how
this next artist, Kara Tenae,

46:03.805 --> 46:06.516

in the blinds.

46:06.558 --> 46:08.977
Kara: Trying to make it
in the music industry,

46:09.019 --> 46:11.980
you need jobs where you can
make your own schedule.

to be a part of a campaign.

those runs like her,

47:36.272 --> 47:38.066
that when she steps out
on stage,

you just have to add
the audience in,

53:43.348 --> 53:44.683
* To the city *

53:44.724 --> 53:46.601
* Ooh, you got me *

53:46.643 --> 53:48.144
* Smokin' out the window *

53:48.186 --> 53:51.981
* Ooh, hoo, hoo *

53:52.023 --> 53:54.150
I just had to be
really strategic

53:54.192 --> 53:57.153
on how I was going
to keep my team together.

53:57.195 --> 54:00.115
Give it up for Rudi,
ladies and gentlemen!

54:00.156 --> 54:02.325
Whoa!

54:02.367 --> 54:04.828
It made me feel really bad
to think that Rudi,

54:04.869 --> 54:07.038
for that split second,
thought, for some reason,

54:07.080 --> 54:08.540
that I was gonna
send her home.

54:08.581 --> 54:09.916
I have a plan.

54:09.958 --> 54:11.793
I feel like, if you go
with anyone else...

54:11.835 --> 54:14.546
[ Laughter ]
...I will die.
Aah!

54:14.587 --> 54:16.631
I'm gonna stick with Gwen.

54:16.673 --> 54:19.092
Me and Rudi,
we're like that.

54:19.134 --> 54:21.678
Daly: Gwen's final
playoff artist, Stee,

54:21.720 --> 54:23.263
comes from a musical family.

54:23.304 --> 54:26.182
Stee: My family, we have
an incredible restaurant.

54:26.224 --> 54:27.517
It's called Kind of Blue.

54:27.559 --> 54:30.103
My band and I,
we perform every weekend.

54:30.145 --> 54:34.107
My sister's in the band,
and we are Stee and Ear Candy.

54:34.149 --> 54:36.776
You know, we kind of candy
to your ears.

54:36.818 --> 54:37.861
You know what I'm saying?

54:37.902 --> 54:41.906
* But, sugar, yes, please *

54:41.948 --> 54:45.869
* Won't you come
and put it down on me *

54:45.910 --> 54:49.664
* I'm right here,
'cause I need *

54:49.706 --> 54:52.584
* Little love
and little sympathy *
There! Let's go!

54:54.711 --> 54:57.672
With Stee,
I turned for him in the blinds.

54:57.714 --> 54:59.382
I'd love to work with you.
You're so gifted.

54:59.424 --> 55:01.217
Thank you, Gwen.

55:01.259 --> 55:02.093
John won.

55:02.135 --> 55:03.261
John Legend.

55:03.303 --> 55:05.472
Welcome to Team Legend.

55:05.513 --> 55:07.766
He ended up
winning his battle,

55:07.807 --> 55:09.392
but then the knockouts
come along.

55:09.434 --> 55:11.478
* I had to live *

55:11.519 --> 55:13.563
God!
* I had to leave *

55:13.605 --> 55:15.815
* I had to live *

55:15.857 --> 55:19.569
* I had to leave *

55:19.611 --> 55:20.987
John:
Stee was incredible.

55:21.029 --> 55:23.573
Pitch perfect
on a really difficult song.

55:23.615 --> 55:26.284
* Pretty wings, pretty wings *

55:26.326 --> 55:28.244
Stee is top, top, top tier.

55:28.286 --> 55:29.996
One of the greatest singers
on this season.

55:30.038 --> 55:37.212
* Yeah, ooh, ooh *

55:37.253 --> 55:40.173
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
[ Cheers and applause ]

55:40.215 --> 55:43.343
John: I was hoping Gwen
would use her steal on Stee,

55:43.385 --> 55:45.970
and I was so happy that she did.

55:46.012 --> 55:50.100
Daly: Wow! Immediately,
a steal from Gwen Stefani!

55:50.141 --> 55:53.269
I don't know how -- I don't know
how -- but I got my chance.

55:53.311 --> 55:55.647
I'm so excited!
Gwen, you are the best.

55:55.689 --> 55:57.607
So now Stee's on Team Gwen,

55:57.649 --> 56:00.026
just as he always
should have been.

56:00.068 --> 56:03.613
Going into the playoffs,
I have five incredible artists.

56:03.655 --> 56:05.281
My team is so strong.

56:05.323 --> 56:06.700
We're the ones to beat,

56:06.741 --> 56:10.203
and I think I might have
the winner on my team this year.

56:16.501 --> 56:17.961
* This is "The Voice" *

56:18.003 --> 56:19.629
Daly: Welcome back to
"The Road to the Playoffs."

56:19.671 --> 56:21.131
Let's see what strategies

56:21.172 --> 56:24.009
veteran "Voice" coach
John Legend used

56:24.050 --> 56:27.137
to shape his team
for the playoffs this season.

56:27.178 --> 56:28.263
**

56:28.304 --> 56:31.850
So I'm back to reclaim
my "Voice" chair.

56:31.891 --> 56:33.810
It's good to be back home.

56:33.852 --> 56:36.062
I still want to win.
I want to beat Reba.

56:36.104 --> 56:37.856
I'm gonna go with John.
Yeah!

56:37.897 --> 56:39.315
I want to beat Gwen.

56:39.357 --> 56:41.609
John.
Yeah!

56:41.651 --> 56:42.652
I want to beat Niall.

56:42.694 --> 56:44.237
John Legend.

56:44.279 --> 56:46.114
[ John laughs ]

56:46.156 --> 56:47.073
Yes!

56:47.115 --> 56:49.784
I'm back.
I haven't lost my touch.

56:49.826 --> 56:51.369
I'm back. I'm back.
No, no, no, no, no.

56:51.411 --> 56:53.580
[ Laughter ]
John's the veteran.

56:53.621 --> 56:55.248
Now that Blake's gone,

56:55.290 --> 56:58.335
I am the most experienced coach
on "The Voice."

56:58.376 --> 57:00.628
I guess. I guess he's
the veteran, other than me.

57:00.670 --> 57:03.882
You can call me the OG,
the King of "The Voice" now.

57:03.923 --> 57:05.300
Think it's safe to say
that Mr. Legend

57:05.342 --> 57:07.218
is the king of
the four-chair turn.

57:07.260 --> 57:08.553
Four chairs!

57:08.595 --> 57:11.014
I have lost count
of how many four-chair turns --

57:11.056 --> 57:14.809
I mean, I have a lot
of four-chair turns this season.

57:14.851 --> 57:16.603
Wow!

57:16.644 --> 57:17.896
Let me have a chance!

57:17.937 --> 57:19.814
John is the professor
of "The Voice,"

57:19.856 --> 57:21.232
and he's a real competitor.

57:21.274 --> 57:23.234
I was the first one
who turned for you.

57:23.276 --> 57:25.612
They just didn't have
the foresight that I had.

57:25.653 --> 57:28.114
He's just so smart.
He's just so smart about music.

57:28.156 --> 57:30.325
You can do all the runs.
You can do all those things.

57:30.367 --> 57:32.786
But your voice has
this gentleness, as well.

57:32.827 --> 57:35.413
It's so sweet.
It's got such a honey to it.

57:35.455 --> 57:37.082
I think my biggest
competition is John.

57:37.123 --> 57:38.917
Have you ever sung
one of my songs before?

57:38.958 --> 57:41.044
Of course.
[ Laughter ]

57:41.086 --> 57:42.587
But you don't want
to do it now, right?

57:42.629 --> 57:43.797
[ Laughter ]

57:43.838 --> 57:46.341
I'm gonna go with John.
Yes!

57:47.384 --> 57:49.052
Living up to
the old namesake.

57:49.094 --> 57:52.180
I have to go with
another Legend -- John.

57:52.222 --> 57:53.890
He is a bit
of a legend around here.

57:55.975 --> 57:58.061
Daly: John's first
playoff artist, Lila Forde,

57:58.103 --> 58:00.146
brought her unique spirit
to the blinds.

58:00.188 --> 58:03.566
Back home, I had
a really spiritual upbringing.

58:03.608 --> 58:07.112
My parents, they have multiple
retreats throughout the year.

58:07.153 --> 58:08.822
It's really, really special.

58:08.863 --> 58:11.032
You can be in the woods

58:11.074 --> 58:14.244
and feel the energy of the trees
and the nature.

58:14.285 --> 58:18.665
But I did have to move to LA
to follow this dream of mine.

58:18.707 --> 58:24.796
* Well, I'm near the end and I *

58:24.838 --> 58:26.965
* But I *

* Babe, I just ain't got
the time *

* Once more, I'm wasted and I *

* I can't find my way home *

[ Cheers and applause ]

58:39.894 --> 58:42.355
Whoo!

58:42.397 --> 58:45.150
Everything felt completely
under your control.
Yeah.

58:45.191 --> 58:47.736
And I could even tell that it
was you playing before I turned

58:47.777 --> 58:51.114
because it felt like the artist
was playing and not the band.

58:51.156 --> 58:54.743
Mr. John Legend over here.

58:54.784 --> 58:56.870
Gosh!
Yes!

58:56.911 --> 58:59.205
I'm so sad.
I'm a super fan of Lila.

58:59.247 --> 59:01.332
She, to me,
is a star in the making.

59:01.374 --> 59:02.625
She's so unique.

59:02.667 --> 59:05.503
Welcome to Team Legend.

59:05.545 --> 59:07.088
John: She's such
an interesting voice,

59:07.130 --> 59:08.715
and I think all the coaches
were taken aback

59:08.757 --> 59:12.218
just watching her do the
interesting things that she did.

59:12.260 --> 59:14.387
Daly: Lila continued to impress
in the battles

59:14.429 --> 59:16.848
when she went against
another four-chair turn,

59:16.890 --> 59:18.516
Jarae Womack.

59:18.558 --> 59:19.768
* ...with his song *

59:19.809 --> 59:22.020
* Telling my whole life *

* Killing me softly *

59:27.901 --> 59:31.780
* With his song *

59:31.821 --> 59:34.366
Lila, you have
a unique magic

59:34.407 --> 59:36.951
to the way that you
express yourself musically.

59:36.993 --> 59:39.496
The winner of this battle
is Lila.

59:39.537 --> 59:41.873
Lila, congratulations!

59:41.915 --> 59:45.210
John: Lila has been so amazing
throughout this competition.

59:45.251 --> 59:46.836
She knows who she is.

59:46.878 --> 59:50.590
She's got that classic voice
with some cool runs, cool ideas.

59:50.632 --> 59:53.426
She's such a great musician.
I love working with Lila.

59:53.468 --> 59:55.345
If you could
time your last vocal

59:55.387 --> 59:58.181
so it's kind of landing right
when the end of that note is...

59:58.223 --> 59:59.557
Yeah.
...that'd be lovely.

59:59.599 --> 01:00:01.559

find a friend *

that I'd see you again *

Niall: Hey!

01:00:11.945 --> 01:00:13.863
I think that Lila Forde

01:00:13.905 --> 01:00:15.115
is the best on Team Legend.

01:00:15.156 --> 01:00:17.075
Every musical deviation

01:00:17.117 --> 01:00:18.410
you made from
the original version

01:00:18.451 --> 01:00:21.579
was just so sharp
and clever and cool.

01:00:21.621 --> 01:00:23.790
She is so unique.

01:00:23.832 --> 01:00:24.916
Lila Forde!

01:00:24.958 --> 01:00:26.543
She can tell a story.

01:00:26.584 --> 01:00:28.878
It feels like she should be
on my team.

next playoff artist,

Kristen Brown.

Every once in a while,

I'll get a country artist
on my team.

She's so gifted.

Let's see how John
continued to build

01:03:07.537 --> 01:03:11.166
his playoff team
with Kaylee Shimizu.

01:03:11.207 --> 01:03:12.876
Kaylee: I'm from the island
of Oahu,

01:03:12.917 --> 01:03:16.296
and one of our favorite beaches
is Ko Olina.

01:03:16.338 --> 01:03:19.341
I'm here at Ko Olina's
secret beach.

It's really pretty here.

Such beautiful palm trees.

01:03:22.844 --> 01:03:26.181
I started singing
at the age of seven,

01:03:26.222 --> 01:03:30.894
and lately, I've been busking
on the side of Waikiki strip.

01:03:30.935 --> 01:03:32.437
I'm fresh out of high school,

01:03:32.479 --> 01:03:35.607
and I don't have any plans
for college at the moment,

01:03:35.648 --> 01:03:39.444

opportunity of my life.

Did you grow up

impossible notes,

in this competition.

She's so young.
She's so special.

01:04:25.198 --> 01:04:28.702
She's still got to figure out
what her artist identity is.

01:04:28.743 --> 01:04:30.203
But I'm here for the journey.

So John's got a jewel
right there.

Daly: In the battles,

01:04:40.046 --> 01:04:42.132
John helped Kaylee connect
on a deeper level.

She's hurting.
Yeah, she's sad
and she's hurt.

Think about, "How do I convey
this emotion

01:04:49.347 --> 01:04:52.183

Kaylee, the control
that you have over your runs

01:05:02.277 --> 01:05:03.236
is phenomenal.

01:05:03.278 --> 01:05:04.988
And we've seen again

01:05:05.030 --> 01:05:07.198
why that was a four-chair turn
in the first place.

with the level of ability

01:05:12.746 --> 01:05:14.748

01:17:22.308 --> 01:17:23.518
Sitting around
just before Christmas,

01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:26.104
getting together,
having great food,

01:17:26.146 --> 01:17:27.731
having good chats, singalongs.

01:17:27.772 --> 01:17:30.567
Any opportunity to watch
two of my uncles fight,

01:17:30.608 --> 01:17:31.443
I'm down for.

01:17:31.484 --> 01:17:33.194
Just being thankful for life.

01:17:33.236 --> 01:17:38.116
Coming together with my family,
and we're all healthy and happy.

01:17:38.158 --> 01:17:40.243
I love getting together

01:17:40.285 --> 01:17:42.746
and sharing profound love
with my family.

01:17:42.787 --> 01:17:44.456
I'm even crying thinking
about my family.

01:17:44.497 --> 01:17:47.250
The most recent Thanksgiving,
we were at home,

01:17:47.292 --> 01:17:49.711
and we made like
a little Thanksgiving for two.

01:17:49.753 --> 01:17:52.797
This year is our first
as an engaged couple,

01:17:52.839 --> 01:17:55.425
so he'll be coming
to my family this year.

01:17:55.467 --> 01:17:57.969
I started celebrating
Friendsgiving,

01:17:58.011 --> 01:18:00.680
just a bunch of close friends
getting together,

01:18:00.722 --> 01:18:04.225
and Friendsgiving
is just as fun as Thanksgiving,

01:18:04.267 --> 01:18:05.435
I'm sure.

01:18:05.477 --> 01:18:08.438
All of the aunts
and uncles get together.

01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:11.941
It's the time to see
your little cousins grow up

01:18:11.983 --> 01:18:13.568
and watch their heads get big.

01:18:13.610 --> 01:18:15.862
You know, it's great.
I love it.

01:18:15.904 --> 01:18:17.447
Until it gets on your nerves.

01:18:17.489 --> 01:18:18.490
You need some money?

01:18:18.531 --> 01:18:19.991
Don't ask me.
I ain't got none.

01:18:20.033 --> 01:18:21.576
Our family grew this year.

01:18:21.618 --> 01:18:24.954
You know, we were a family
of four before the year started.

01:18:24.996 --> 01:18:27.290
And now we're a family of six.

01:18:27.332 --> 01:18:28.708
And Chrissy and I celebrated

01:18:28.750 --> 01:18:31.169
10 years of being married
this year.

01:18:31.211 --> 01:18:33.797
I'm really grateful
for our partnership

01:18:33.838 --> 01:18:35.674
and the family
we've grown together.

01:18:35.715 --> 01:18:40.053
I host Thanksgiving every year,
and I don't serve turkey.

01:18:40.095 --> 01:18:41.596
I make a crab boil.

01:18:41.638 --> 01:18:44.557
We crack the crabs, just hands,
and we just dive in.

01:18:44.599 --> 01:18:46.810
Our whole kitchen
is filled with food,

01:18:46.851 --> 01:18:50.355
and then we spend the next,
like, three days eating.

01:18:50.397 --> 01:18:52.232
Thanksgiving is not
a one-day thing for us.

01:18:52.273 --> 01:18:53.817
It's like a whole weekend.

01:18:53.858 --> 01:18:57.570
My mom would make the most
immaculate banana pudding.

01:18:57.612 --> 01:19:00.448
I know, weird for --
weird for Thanksgiving,

01:19:00.490 --> 01:19:02.242
but, oh, my gosh, it hit.

01:19:02.283 --> 01:19:03.493
The smoked turkey.

01:19:03.535 --> 01:19:04.911
Not just turkey.
You have to go smoked.

01:19:04.953 --> 01:19:06.162
When I eat turkey, I'm like,

01:19:06.204 --> 01:19:07.497
"Ooh, I'll eat every part
of that turkey."

01:19:07.539 --> 01:19:08.957
Lila:
We'll hang around the fire.

01:19:08.998 --> 01:19:11.501
And the dogs,
they're usually in Seattle.

01:19:11.543 --> 01:19:14.170
It's cold and rainy,
so it feels really cozy.

01:19:14.212 --> 01:19:18.383
I don't think words can explain
how important it is

01:19:18.425 --> 01:19:22.429
to have people in your corner
that genuinely care about you,

01:19:22.470 --> 01:19:24.556
so I'm forever grateful
for them.

01:19:24.597 --> 01:19:27.017
Yeah, we locked in forever.

01:19:27.058 --> 01:19:29.561
Oh, I am so thankful for a job,

01:19:29.602 --> 01:19:32.480
getting to work on "The Voice,"
my first season,

01:19:32.522 --> 01:19:34.065
having all the fun
that I've had,

01:19:34.107 --> 01:19:35.567
meeting all the new people.

01:19:35.608 --> 01:19:38.862
I'm thankful for the gift
of music and the opportunity

01:19:38.903 --> 01:19:40.030
to be here on "The Voice."

01:19:40.071 --> 01:19:41.031
I'm really grateful.

01:19:41.072 --> 01:19:42.449
My parents came down for blinds.

01:19:42.490 --> 01:19:45.285
My mom cried on the side
of the stage.

01:19:45.326 --> 01:19:47.746
I'm extremely thankful
to be here

01:19:47.787 --> 01:19:50.957
working with one of
my all-time favorite musicians,

01:19:50.999 --> 01:19:52.000
John Legend.

01:19:52.042 --> 01:19:53.626
This is a dream come true.

01:19:53.668 --> 01:19:55.545
I'm so grateful
for my coach, Gwen.

01:19:55.587 --> 01:20:00.050
For every ounce of advice,
every critique.

01:20:00.091 --> 01:20:01.217
I don't take it for granted.

01:20:01.259 --> 01:20:02.635
I am super thankful for

01:20:02.677 --> 01:20:04.512
my relationship with Reba.

01:20:04.554 --> 01:20:06.306
How long
you been playing?

01:20:06.348 --> 01:20:08.391
I've been playing guitar
for five years.

01:20:08.433 --> 01:20:09.601
Good for you.

01:20:09.642 --> 01:20:10.894
Because I feel like
we've really

01:20:10.935 --> 01:20:12.354
gained a friendship.

01:20:12.395 --> 01:20:14.314
I am so thankful for you, Niall.

01:20:14.356 --> 01:20:15.523
Hello!

01:20:15.565 --> 01:20:17.317
My family
is indebted to you, bro.

01:20:17.359 --> 01:20:19.069
It means so much
that you believe in me,

01:20:19.110 --> 01:20:22.197
because it feels like
the first time in this industry

01:20:22.238 --> 01:20:23.698
that somebody really has.

01:20:23.740 --> 01:20:25.617
You have to have people
that walk alongside you

01:20:25.658 --> 01:20:27.077
to help you on this journey,

01:20:27.118 --> 01:20:29.204
and I've been able
to make a family here.

01:20:29.245 --> 01:20:31.915
Hopefully, they'll be at
my Thanksgiving dinner table

01:20:31.956 --> 01:20:32.791
one day.

01:20:32.832 --> 01:20:35.710
Happy Thanksgiving, everybody.

01:20:35.752 --> 01:20:37.420
Daly: In true
Thanksgiving spirit,

01:20:37.462 --> 01:20:39.255
our coaches came together
this season

01:20:39.297 --> 01:20:41.341
for one incredible performance.

01:20:41.383 --> 01:20:42.759
Reba: I'm about
to take the stage

01:20:42.801 --> 01:20:44.928
for my very first
coaches' performance

01:20:44.969 --> 01:20:47.847
of the Eagles song
"Take It Easy."

01:20:47.889 --> 01:20:50.350
It's so much fun
to get to collaborate

01:20:50.392 --> 01:20:51.685
with the other coaches.

01:20:51.726 --> 01:20:53.770
We're gonna have
so much fun up there.

01:20:53.812 --> 01:20:55.355
Wish me luck, okay?
