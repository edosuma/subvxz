00:01.958 --> 00:05.625
(narration): "She runs through
the dark and cold halls...

00:05.625 --> 00:08.875
Senses heightened
to any sound she makes.

00:09.542 --> 00:13.500
The little light she uses,
bounces from the walls.

00:13.500 --> 00:17.250
Deceiving her with shadows
of false sanctuary.

00:17.958 --> 00:19.875
She's terrified,

00:19.875 --> 00:23.167
but focussed.
Ready to move, until...

00:23.500 --> 00:25.250
she hears him.

00:25.917 --> 00:29.042
His deep
and hauntingly calm breath,

00:29.042 --> 00:31.542
slightly elevated by the hunt,

00:31.542 --> 00:35.417
matches the rhythmic
shuffle of his stride.

00:35.958 --> 00:39.083
She stops and listens,

00:39.333 --> 00:42.708
hoping her nightmare will end.

00:43.333 --> 00:49.333
Her heart breaks until her
salvation comes into view in
the shape of an exit door.

00:49.667 --> 00:54.875
She looks behind her,
gaining that last ounce
of courage to survive.

00:54.875 --> 00:56.750
And she runs...

00:57.083 --> 01:01.375
towards the exit doors
with the anticipation pounding
through her shaking body.

01:01.375 --> 01:03.875
But, by some cruel
twist of fate,

01:03.875 --> 01:05.750
what she finds...

01:05.750 --> 01:07.167
is him.

01:07.417 --> 01:11.542
The horror in her eyes upon
his cold and jarring grasp.

01:13.375 --> 01:15.583
In that moment of cruel fate,

01:15.583 --> 01:19.792
her life flashed before her eyes
in a millisecond.

01:20.750 --> 01:26.042
That horror in his eyes
is what he, the monster,

01:26.042 --> 01:28.125
craved for.

01:28.125 --> 01:30.292
It's what made his appetite grow

01:30.292 --> 01:32.958
with each victim the universe
offered up as sacrifice.

01:33.875 --> 01:39.250
It's what made an otherwise
ungodly man... a god.

01:40.250 --> 01:43.583
God of death.
God of terror.

01:45.792 --> 01:47.542
But tonight's sacrificial feast

01:47.542 --> 01:51.458
was just a taste...
of the meal to come."

01:51.458 --> 01:54.125
(applause)

01:59.208 --> 02:01.208
Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

02:01.208 --> 02:02.875
- - No problem.

02:02.875 --> 02:05.417
- Hi. I mean, hello.
Mr. Blake.

02:05.417 --> 02:07.958
- Oh, true fans
call me Miles.

02:07.958 --> 02:09.958
(sighing)
- Miles.

02:09.958 --> 02:12.292
Your books,
they're... so addicting.

02:12.292 --> 02:14.292
In a good way.
A great way.

02:17.708 --> 02:21.875
Uh, the murders in your books,
they're so macabre. Detailed.

02:21.875 --> 02:24.375
It's like you can see inside
of all of my own fears.

02:24.375 --> 02:26.333
How do you do that so well?

02:26.333 --> 02:29.667
- Do we have time for a fan?
- I think so.

02:30.458 --> 02:33.958
- Anytime I'm writing
a new book, I just think about,

02:33.958 --> 02:36.333
you know, what my own fears are.

02:36.333 --> 02:38.000
You know, my bestseller
before this one,

02:38.000 --> 02:40.333
What Lies in the Woods, that's
just based on my own fears.

02:40.333 --> 02:45.208
And actually writing
that story, I'm... not afraid
of the woods anymore.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.042
For that, I'm grateful.

02:49.042 --> 02:50.625
And for you, too, of course,

02:50.625 --> 02:53.042
the reader, for actually
buying the book.

02:53.042 --> 02:55.042
- Oh, thank you so much.

02:55.042 --> 02:57.042
- Thank you so much.

02:57.042 --> 02:58.292
Next.

02:58.292 --> 02:59.708
- Hi.
- Hi, there.

02:59.708 --> 03:02.042
- All right, thanks, guys.

03:02.042 --> 03:03.167
Thanks for coming.
- Thank you.

03:03.167 --> 03:05.208
- Good to see you. Thanks.

03:05.208 --> 03:06.708
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

03:07.792 --> 03:10.875
All right, I checked you in
through the airline app.

03:10.875 --> 03:12.583
I confirmed all your bags
and boxes are already

03:12.583 --> 03:14.375
at the house the university
is providing.

03:14.375 --> 03:17.500
- Okay. It'd be nice to get
settled in before classes start.

03:17.500 --> 03:19.708
- You'll have a few days
to settle in.

03:19.708 --> 03:21.250
- Great.

03:21.250 --> 03:23.500
- Are you sure you wanna
do this?

03:23.500 --> 03:27.375
Teaching a semester of class
could be a lot of work.

03:27.375 --> 03:29.708
We can always back out.
Blame the book tour.

03:29.708 --> 03:31.833
- No, no, it's good
for the soul to be back.

03:31.833 --> 03:33.708
Besides, teaching about
writing's the easy part.

03:33.708 --> 03:35.583
What I'm looking forward to
is the time off.

03:37.292 --> 03:40.792
- Are you promising a draft
when the semester's over?

03:40.792 --> 03:42.375
- Yes, boss.

03:43.667 --> 03:45.833
See you on the other side
of my next bestseller.

03:56.083 --> 03:58.208
(soft music)

04:16.708 --> 04:18.333
(phone chiming)

04:20.250 --> 04:22.958
- Saved by the bell, Ashley.

04:36.417 --> 04:39.667
- Ha, ha, the daughter
I never had.

04:39.667 --> 04:41.333
- One of these days,
I'm gonna tell your daughter

04:41.333 --> 04:42.917
that you keep saying that.
(chuckling)

04:42.917 --> 04:44.542
- It's good to see you.

04:44.542 --> 04:46.875
- Yeah, it's been
a busy semester.

04:46.875 --> 04:49.333
Sometimes I kick myself
for choosing to write

04:49.333 --> 04:51.833
my first novel
as my Master's thesis.

04:51.833 --> 04:54.542
- You know, I remember my early
days as a writer.

04:54.542 --> 04:56.750
I really loved deadlines.

04:56.750 --> 04:59.917
And the whooshing sound they
made as they sped right by.

04:59.917 --> 05:01.542
(laughing)

05:01.542 --> 05:03.792
- But yeah, deadlines
aren't really real

05:03.792 --> 05:07.292
until they're staring at you...
right in the face.

05:07.292 --> 05:11.208
- Ah yes, your chapters.
- Hmm.

05:11.208 --> 05:12.792
- They are exemplary.

05:14.542 --> 05:17.417
- You're just saying that.
- Well, don't thank me yet.

05:17.417 --> 05:21.000
I'm about to make your life
and your deadlines

05:21.000 --> 05:22.667
a little more busy.

05:23.875 --> 05:27.458
So, we're going to have a
celebrity of sorts on campus.

05:27.458 --> 05:29.208
- Trust me, I know.

05:29.208 --> 05:32.458
I'm already enrolled
in his Dynamics of Murder
Mysteries class.

05:32.458 --> 05:35.542
- Yeah, but that's
an underclassman credit.

05:35.542 --> 05:38.042
And you're a thesis away--
- A novel.

05:38.042 --> 05:41.542
- Yes, a novel away
from graduating with
a Master's degree.

05:41.542 --> 05:43.625
- He's my favorite author.

05:43.625 --> 05:45.625
So, wait, why is this bad news?

05:45.625 --> 05:47.333
I can still take
the class, right?

05:47.333 --> 05:48.958
- Oh, you'll be in his class,

05:48.958 --> 05:50.958
although from a different
vantage point.

05:50.958 --> 05:56.958
Mr. Blake needs a teaching
assistant, and I've chosen you.

05:56.958 --> 05:58.667
- I'm just... I'm confused.

05:58.667 --> 06:00.375
You have so many other options,

06:00.375 --> 06:02.500
you know, like
uh, David, your TA,

06:02.500 --> 06:04.542
he would love something
like this.

06:04.542 --> 06:05.833
- Yes, yes, David is driven,

06:05.833 --> 06:08.583
but you'd benefit
from this the most.

06:08.583 --> 06:10.583
- Professor, I am flattered,

06:10.583 --> 06:12.542
but I just, I have so much
on my plate right now.

06:12.542 --> 06:16.375
- Ashley, listen to me,
you have more talent

06:16.375 --> 06:18.708
than any student
that has ever passed

06:18.708 --> 06:22.625
through my lecture hall doors
in over 30 years of teaching.

06:22.625 --> 06:24.875
That doesn't come by too often.

06:26.042 --> 06:29.583
Being under the wing
of somebody like Miles Blake

06:29.583 --> 06:33.750
could be all that's standing
between you and your dream.

06:33.750 --> 06:35.083
- Okay.

06:35.083 --> 06:36.375
- All right.

06:40.875 --> 06:42.708
- I'm assuming by the look
on your face

06:42.708 --> 06:44.250
that he told you
the wonderful news.

06:44.250 --> 06:45.583
- Hi, David.

06:46.667 --> 06:48.292
I... didn't want to--
- You didn't want

06:48.292 --> 06:49.875
the opportunity of a lifetime?

06:49.875 --> 06:51.458
Is that what you were
going to say?

06:51.458 --> 06:53.167
- No, I meant--
- Because that would make him

06:53.167 --> 06:54.542
choosing you over me
even worse.

06:54.542 --> 06:56.458
- Look, I'm sorry, David.

06:56.458 --> 06:59.417
- Hey, hey, um, listen.

06:59.417 --> 07:01.667
I'm just giving you a hard time.

07:01.667 --> 07:03.542
You gotta learn
how to take a joke, Ash.

07:03.542 --> 07:05.542
No, I'm... I'm, you know,
I'm swamped

07:05.542 --> 07:07.583
with Professor Dorr's
classes anyways.

07:07.583 --> 07:09.750
That's uh... You know,
that's probably why he chose you

07:09.750 --> 07:11.542
over me in the
first place, yeah.

07:11.542 --> 07:13.167
He didn't wanna lose his TA.

07:15.708 --> 07:19.542
By the way, I um...
I read your chapters.

07:20.500 --> 07:22.208
- You did what?

07:22.208 --> 07:25.708
- Yeah, they were just uh,
sitting there on his desk.

07:25.708 --> 07:28.667
I thought they were
an underclassman's project
or something.

07:28.667 --> 07:31.500
Oh the... that's not...
that's not what I meant.

07:32.542 --> 07:34.625
Yeah, the pages were great.

07:35.333 --> 07:36.958
There's just one thing missing.

07:37.583 --> 07:39.167
- Yeah? What was that?

07:40.792 --> 07:43.042
- You need a more
threatening villain.

07:44.125 --> 07:45.625
A better adversary.

07:48.208 --> 07:49.917
(eerie music)

07:59.917 --> 08:02.750
- He actually said that?
- I know, right?

08:02.750 --> 08:04.917
And the creepy thing
was he didn't even seem

08:04.917 --> 08:06.542
like he was talking
about my book.

08:06.542 --> 08:08.750
Like it was some sort of threat,
or something.

08:08.750 --> 08:10.750
- Okay, you need to introduce me
to this little boy

08:10.750 --> 08:12.167
'cause I'll put him
in his place.

08:12.167 --> 08:13.083
(laughing)

08:13.792 --> 08:16.208
Anyway, I'm sure
he's just jealous.

08:16.208 --> 08:19.417
I mean, you get to work
with "the" Miles Blake.

08:19.417 --> 08:21.708
- It's not that big of a deal.
- Oh, come on!

08:21.708 --> 08:24.708
I bet you have a copy of one of
his books in your bag right now.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.083
(sighing)

08:28.542 --> 08:31.125
(laughing)
Thank you.

08:31.125 --> 08:32.500
Wow!

08:32.500 --> 08:34.292
He's handsome.

08:34.292 --> 08:37.417
Writers aren't supposed to be
that handsome, Ashley!

08:37.417 --> 08:40.375
- Okay.
- Maybe you'll fall in love

08:40.375 --> 08:42.583
and make best-selling author
babies together.

08:42.583 --> 08:44.583
- That is the last thing
I am looking for right now.

08:44.583 --> 08:46.500
I'm just gonna try to soak up
all the knowledge

08:46.500 --> 08:47.875
and experience that I can.

08:47.875 --> 08:49.625
He probably won't even talk
to me that much.

08:49.625 --> 08:51.833
- Can I keep this?
- No.

08:51.833 --> 08:53.542
- Oh, come on.
- Well, enough about me.

08:53.542 --> 08:55.625
How's your last semester
of criminal justice going?

08:56.708 --> 08:59.542
- It's taken a dark turn
this semester.

08:59.542 --> 09:02.208
- How so?
- Another internship,

09:02.208 --> 09:04.208
some on-the-job education.

09:04.208 --> 09:05.500
- Okay, where?

09:06.375 --> 09:09.375
- What's the last place
you once said you'd ever
wanna be locked in?

09:09.375 --> 09:12.208
- No!
- Mm-hmm.

09:12.208 --> 09:16.042
This girl's gonna be
spending her last semester
in the town morgue.

09:16.042 --> 09:18.208
- I suppose if you're gonna be
a detective, you do have

09:18.208 --> 09:20.500
to get used to looking at
dead bodies, right? But still.

09:20.500 --> 09:22.708
- It is what it is.
I'll be a fly on the wall

09:22.708 --> 09:24.875
for any criminal investigative
biopsies, you know.

09:24.875 --> 09:26.875
- And you'll tell your best
friend everything?

09:26.875 --> 09:29.958
Maybe some inspiration
for her future stories?

09:29.958 --> 09:32.042
- Hmm. Only if you give me
that book!

09:32.042 --> 09:33.625
- No!
- Come on!

09:33.625 --> 09:35.750
But if I ever meet him,
he's fair game.

09:35.750 --> 09:37.917
- All right, okay. Sure.
(laughing)

09:37.917 --> 09:39.542
- Sure? What do you mean sure?

09:39.542 --> 09:40.792
- I'm just saying.

09:40.792 --> 09:42.042
- I mean what I say.

09:42.042 --> 09:44.000
- We'll see about that.
We'll see.

10:01.292 --> 10:02.708
- Too much?

10:04.208 --> 10:06.542
You know, I worry
with the younger college crowd

10:06.542 --> 10:08.417
that most likely haven't read
my books,

10:08.417 --> 10:10.917
they won't take me seriously
unless they actually
see the work.

10:10.917 --> 10:14.667
- Oh, I think everyone in this
class will know who you are.

10:14.667 --> 10:16.708
Um, I like the books.

10:16.708 --> 10:18.417
It's a good touch.

10:18.917 --> 10:21.792
- Miles Blake.
- Ashley... Ashley Dunn.

10:21.792 --> 10:24.375
- Ah, the prodigy.
Nice to finally meet you.

10:24.375 --> 10:26.125
- Prodigy? I...

10:26.125 --> 10:28.833
- Professor Dorr is uh,
is pretty proud.

10:28.833 --> 10:31.042
- I am so sorry.
I did not know that he was

10:31.042 --> 10:33.167
going to give you
those chapters.

10:33.167 --> 10:34.125
- Ashley...

10:35.208 --> 10:36.375
They were brilliant.

10:37.167 --> 10:39.958
You know, I gotta admit, I get
asked to read short stories,

10:39.958 --> 10:42.833
chapters, full on manuscripts,
pretty much everywhere I go,

10:42.833 --> 10:44.875
so when he put those
on my desk with a smile,

10:44.875 --> 10:47.042
it was a little...
- Cringy?

10:47.042 --> 10:50.042
- Yeah, a little bit, but I told
him I'd read 'em as a courtesy.

10:50.042 --> 10:52.792
You know, rarely do the pages
actually ever live up

10:52.792 --> 10:56.542
to the hype, but you...

10:56.542 --> 10:59.792
Your voice,
your narrative structure,

10:59.792 --> 11:04.750
your syntax, I mean,
it's... mesmerizing.

11:04.750 --> 11:06.167
Impressive.

11:07.417 --> 11:09.000
- Thank you.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.042
Um... I've worked
really hard on them.

11:11.042 --> 11:12.750
- I like that.

11:12.750 --> 11:15.208
It's a strength to know
how to take a compliment

11:15.208 --> 11:17.375
and they come very rarely
when you're first starting out.

11:17.375 --> 11:20.083
Even less so from
the critics' corner when
you're actually published.

11:20.083 --> 11:22.000
- I get that from Professor Dorr
all the time.

11:22.000 --> 11:25.042
- Well, he's a wise man.
- Yes, he is.

11:25.042 --> 11:28.042
- So, all I need from you
is some basic assistance,

11:28.042 --> 11:30.375
uh, fielding students'
questions,

11:30.375 --> 11:32.750
help with the assignments
when they get turned in,

11:32.750 --> 11:35.167
you know, I could use
some extra eyes on 'em.

11:37.542 --> 11:39.667
Come on!
- Sorry?

11:41.458 --> 11:43.875
- Let's go for a walk.
- Oh.

11:47.417 --> 11:51.208
- And you have writers that
are far more talented than me

11:51.208 --> 11:53.958
that never got to see
their dreams come true

11:53.958 --> 11:56.792
because the universe
had different plans for 'em

11:56.792 --> 12:01.625
or they didn't take
the opportunities that were
in front of 'em, but I'm...

12:01.625 --> 12:03.708
I'm really glad that
you took this one.

12:03.708 --> 12:06.333
I mean, who knows?
You might be looking out

12:06.333 --> 12:08.792
in a sea of hundreds
of your fans soon,

12:08.792 --> 12:11.083
waiting for you
to sign your bestseller.

12:11.083 --> 12:13.750
(sighing)
- That's the dream.

12:13.750 --> 12:15.500
Hopefully no stalkers, though.

12:15.500 --> 12:17.958
- Ah. My second book.

12:17.958 --> 12:19.625
You read that too, I assume?

12:19.625 --> 12:21.208
- I've read all of them.

12:21.208 --> 12:24.125
You know, I've always wondered,
is that a true story?

12:25.000 --> 12:28.042
- I've had my share
of uniquely devoted fans,

12:28.042 --> 12:30.458
but nothing that me or
my publicist couldn't handle.

12:30.458 --> 12:32.458
(chuckling)

12:37.583 --> 12:40.167
(sighing)
And here we are.

12:40.167 --> 12:42.708
Took you from one side
of the campus to the next.

12:42.708 --> 12:44.417
- You get to stay here?

12:44.417 --> 12:47.167
- Well, more importantly,
I actually get to write here.

12:47.167 --> 12:49.500
You know, when I'm not teaching,
of course.

12:50.042 --> 12:52.458
You know, between you and I,

12:52.458 --> 12:56.542
I had two very specific
deal-breaking requests
in my contract.

12:56.542 --> 13:00.792
One, a unique house of my own
with room and board.

13:01.583 --> 13:05.875
And two, teacher's assistant
to pick up the extra work,

13:05.875 --> 13:08.083
so I could actually write
in said home.

13:08.875 --> 13:12.833
This... is where I'm gonna write
my next bestseller.

13:14.208 --> 13:16.542
- Your new book,
what's it about?

13:16.542 --> 13:18.375
- I don't know.

13:18.375 --> 13:20.042
Hasn't told me yet.

13:21.542 --> 13:23.375
See ya in class.

13:25.458 --> 13:27.250
(eerie music)

13:44.417 --> 13:46.042
- Hey!

13:47.000 --> 13:49.208
You okay?
- Yeah, I guess.

13:49.208 --> 13:52.042
- Is there a problem?
- Not yet.

13:52.042 --> 13:53.417
- I suggest you keep
walking then.

13:55.208 --> 13:57.333
- Thanks.
- No problem.

14:04.292 --> 14:06.875
(indistinct chatter)

14:06.875 --> 14:09.083
- It helps get more money,
it helps with clean up.

14:09.083 --> 14:11.667
- Guess it adds to something.
- Um, Mr. Blake?

14:11.667 --> 14:14.375
Sorry to interrupt.
Hi, Ashley.

14:14.375 --> 14:15.875
- Hi, David.

14:15.875 --> 14:19.042
- Uh, I... I just wanna say
that I... I'm a big fan.

14:19.042 --> 14:22.542
I read all of your books,
a few times over, and I...

14:22.542 --> 14:25.583
I read your book on writing,
as well. So inspiring.

14:25.583 --> 14:28.125
And I've actually written
seven novels myself.

14:28.125 --> 14:30.000
I started when I was 15.

14:30.583 --> 14:34.042
- Very nice to hear.
Congratulations on the writing.

14:34.042 --> 14:36.583
If you'll excuse me, we have
a class to get started.

14:36.583 --> 14:38.083
It was nice to meet you.

14:44.083 --> 14:46.375
I see two types
of people out there.

14:48.917 --> 14:51.167
Those of you who are looking
to learn a thing or two

14:51.167 --> 14:53.042
about the murder mystery genre

14:53.042 --> 14:55.958
and those of you who are looking
for an easy credit.

14:57.500 --> 15:00.917
But each and every one of you
share one thing in common.

15:00.917 --> 15:05.667
We... love... a good mystery.

15:06.750 --> 15:10.500
Since the dawn of mankind,
we have been sharing stories

15:10.500 --> 15:12.917
of mystery, and intrigue,

15:12.917 --> 15:16.750
and none of those stories
capture our imagination

15:16.750 --> 15:20.958
more than those involving...
(groaning)

15:20.958 --> 15:22.500
Murder!
(laughter)

15:24.500 --> 15:26.958
But why do we kill, right?

15:26.958 --> 15:31.042
What drives somebody
to commit murder?

15:32.667 --> 15:34.125
It's our greatest mystery.

15:34.125 --> 15:36.042
(footsteps thudding)

15:37.667 --> 15:39.750
- Can I help you?
- Hey!

15:39.750 --> 15:41.417
Did you write those books?

15:42.708 --> 15:45.708
- Yes. Yes, I did. Let me
guess, you didn't like 'em.

15:45.708 --> 15:47.167
- Miles?

15:48.458 --> 15:50.458
- Hey, man, not here.

15:50.458 --> 15:52.958
- You need to get
outta my face right now.

15:52.958 --> 15:54.875
- I thought I told you
to keep walking?

15:54.875 --> 15:56.792
- Whoa, gentlemen, please!

15:56.792 --> 16:00.417
- Every time you come here,
you're trying to start stuff.

16:00.417 --> 16:03.333
- Now I have a problem
with you, sport.

16:04.375 --> 16:05.875
(groaning)

16:05.875 --> 16:07.333
(gasping and exclaiming)

16:16.125 --> 16:18.625
(chuckling)
- Ladies and gentlemen,

16:18.625 --> 16:21.792
Jonathan Hansen and Liam Rodgers
of the theater department.

16:21.792 --> 16:23.708
(applause)

16:24.583 --> 16:26.500
Come on, give it up.

16:27.042 --> 16:30.208
Every murder mystery
has set-ups,

16:30.208 --> 16:32.583
shocking surprises, right?

16:32.583 --> 16:36.125
Now, some of you saw Mr. Hansen
when he walked in, right?

16:36.125 --> 16:38.083
His disheveled, mysterious,
no offense,

16:38.083 --> 16:40.375
somewhat creepy appearance.

16:40.375 --> 16:42.500
Captured your attention, right?

16:42.500 --> 16:45.333
If only for a moment.

16:45.333 --> 16:47.042
Who was he?

16:49.375 --> 16:52.708
Did he belong in this class?
If not, why not?

16:52.708 --> 16:58.333
Was I going to be the product
of a truly deranged individual

16:58.333 --> 17:00.958
who is hellbent
on killing me, huh?

17:02.000 --> 17:04.583
Was he a, uh... I don't know,

17:04.583 --> 17:07.458
an overzealous fan entranced
by my brilliance?

17:07.458 --> 17:09.875
Something I may have written
about in my second book,

17:09.875 --> 17:11.750
for those of you loyal readers.

17:12.917 --> 17:14.542
And also...

17:17.292 --> 17:19.417
Who is this knight
in metaphorical shining armor,

17:19.417 --> 17:21.208
who came to save the day?
(chuckling)

17:21.208 --> 17:23.583
Huh? Now, that...

17:25.167 --> 17:28.750
that, my fellow writers...

17:30.542 --> 17:32.375
and easy credit seekers,

17:32.375 --> 17:37.708
is what makes the murder mystery
genre so enthralling

17:37.708 --> 17:44.167
for readers, and what makes
writing them so much fun.

17:47.542 --> 17:50.208
That's what I hope
to teach you in this class.

17:50.208 --> 17:51.875
Let's give it up
for these two, huh?

17:51.875 --> 17:54.583
(applause)

18:04.000 --> 18:06.417
- He's amazing, isn't he?

18:06.417 --> 18:09.292
Brilliant. Just a...
a single class with him

18:09.292 --> 18:12.250
has me rethinking
everything I've written.

18:12.250 --> 18:14.875
Can you believe the...
the adrenaline

18:14.875 --> 18:17.083
of watching someone
commit murder?

18:17.083 --> 18:19.458
I mean didn't it send chills
through your bones?

18:19.458 --> 18:22.250
- Maybe not for the same reasons
as you, but uh...

18:22.250 --> 18:23.958
(phone chiming)
Sorry.

18:25.125 --> 18:28.333
Oh, I'm sorry, David,
I have to go meet someone,
but have a great night.

18:36.167 --> 18:38.208
(♪)

18:40.375 --> 18:43.125
- You need to learn
to charge that thing.

18:43.125 --> 18:44.833
You're gonna be stranded
without it.

18:44.833 --> 18:46.333
(laughing)

18:49.417 --> 18:52.292
- Seriously though, it was...
it was so disturbing,

18:52.292 --> 18:56.542
but thrilling at the same time.
Like, which I hate to admit,

18:56.542 --> 18:59.375
David was a little
too thrilled, though.

18:59.375 --> 19:01.958
- That doesn't surprise me.
(sighing)

19:01.958 --> 19:04.750
- I just can't fathom
seeing something like that.

19:04.750 --> 19:06.792
Like, I've never even seen
a dead body.

19:06.792 --> 19:08.958
I can't imagine what
you're seeing in the morgue.

19:08.958 --> 19:10.417
- Ugh, nothing yet.

19:10.417 --> 19:12.208
I mean, that's a good thing.

19:12.208 --> 19:17.042
But let's forget about
dead bodies, and uh...

19:17.042 --> 19:22.708
tell me about Professor Handsome
and your little walk together.

19:22.708 --> 19:24.417
- I told you,
it's not like that.

19:24.417 --> 19:26.208
It's all about the work.

19:26.208 --> 19:28.458
He... he told me how
he got started and it...

19:28.458 --> 19:30.583
it gave me hope.
Made me feel worthy.

19:30.583 --> 19:33.958
Like, I got home and the words
just kept flowing.

19:33.958 --> 19:37.042
It... it felt like he kicked
a door open for me, you know.

19:37.042 --> 19:39.292
Like, the chapters
just kept coming,

19:39.292 --> 19:40.750
and I can't stop it's...

19:41.458 --> 19:44.750
- Ooh, speaking
of kicking in doors...

19:46.167 --> 19:48.667
- Well, I didn't expect
to see you here.

19:49.542 --> 19:52.292
Shouldn't you be writing?
- Shouldn't you?

19:53.625 --> 19:57.000
- I guess we writers do have
to eat and drink.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.458
(laughing)

19:58.458 --> 20:01.375
- Oh, um, sorry, Miles Blake,

20:01.375 --> 20:03.500
this is my best friend, Jordan.
- Hi.

20:03.500 --> 20:05.208
Nice to finally meet you.

20:05.208 --> 20:06.792
It's an honor.

20:06.792 --> 20:08.333
- Oh, no, honor's all mine.

20:08.333 --> 20:10.083
Any friend of Ashley's.

20:10.083 --> 20:11.667
Can I get you anything?

20:13.500 --> 20:15.208
What do you say,
a round on me?

20:15.208 --> 20:16.792
- Oh, let's do this.

20:17.667 --> 20:20.708
(indistinct chatter)

20:20.708 --> 20:23.250
- It seems like, you know,
you go in the big city,

20:23.250 --> 20:25.250
you just drink
all night long, right?

20:25.250 --> 20:27.000
It doesn't seem fair.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.958
All right, have a good night.

20:28.958 --> 20:30.625
- Good night.

20:31.042 --> 20:32.500
(giggling)
- Come on.

20:32.500 --> 20:34.333
- I could run right now.

20:34.333 --> 20:36.208
I could run six miles.
(laughing)

20:37.042 --> 20:39.000
- That was beautiful.
- Thanks.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.750
- That was beautiful.
(laughing)

20:41.708 --> 20:42.708
- Oh, you know...

20:54.792 --> 20:56.208
(sighing)

21:09.875 --> 21:11.875
(ominous music)

21:17.542 --> 21:18.708
(grunts)

21:20.625 --> 21:21.792
(grunts)

21:21.792 --> 21:25.250
(breathing heavily)

21:47.917 --> 21:51.750
- Details. We have to be
thinking about those details.

21:51.750 --> 21:53.375
Now, I want you
to see the story,

21:53.375 --> 21:56.625
not only through the eyes
of the victim of the murder,

21:56.625 --> 21:58.917
but through the killer's eyes
as well.

21:58.917 --> 22:00.708
Now, how do we do that?

22:00.708 --> 22:04.417
How do we capture the reality
of what it's like

22:04.417 --> 22:06.500
to murder somebody

22:06.500 --> 22:10.708
and give the reader
that authentic experience?

22:15.458 --> 22:17.333
That's a trick
question, folks.

22:17.333 --> 22:18.500
(chuckling)
I mean...

22:19.958 --> 22:21.875
I mean, we need to do more
than research, right?

22:21.875 --> 22:24.292
I mean, in a...
in an ideal world,

22:24.292 --> 22:26.083
we'd just commit
the murder ourselves.

22:26.958 --> 22:30.833
That's the only way to offer
the reader true authenticity.

22:32.083 --> 22:35.500
But we are not going to be
that dedicated to our work,

22:35.500 --> 22:38.208
my young writers, right?

22:38.208 --> 22:39.833
I need to hear a verbal yes.

22:39.833 --> 22:41.708
(students agreeing)
Yes, yes, yes, yes, okay.

22:42.750 --> 22:44.083
Uh, yeah?

22:44.083 --> 22:46.208
Uh... Derek, right?

22:46.208 --> 22:48.375
- Um, David.
David Freeman.

22:48.375 --> 22:49.625
- Yeah, David.
What's up?

22:49.625 --> 22:52.208
- I read your book on writing.

22:52.208 --> 22:56.250
You... you mentioned that when
you were first starting out,

22:56.250 --> 22:57.833
you would pick a random person
from a crowd

22:57.833 --> 23:01.708
and follow them at night,
trying to remain unseen.

23:01.708 --> 23:04.125
Is that close enough
to authenticity?

23:06.000 --> 23:07.792
- Uh, guilty as charged.

23:07.792 --> 23:09.708
Let that be a lesson
to everybody.

23:09.708 --> 23:11.500
Be careful of the stories
you tell about yourself

23:11.500 --> 23:14.333
because they will come back
to haunt you.

23:14.958 --> 23:16.833
But yeah, if...

23:16.833 --> 23:21.875
in my early days of anonymity
I did partake in that odd,

23:21.875 --> 23:26.375
and let's just call it out,
creepy exercise,

23:26.375 --> 23:29.833
but uh, yeah, no I...
I found a new way.

23:31.458 --> 23:37.125
Controlled and...
appropriate environment.

23:40.375 --> 23:41.625
In here.

23:45.417 --> 23:48.042
We're writers, aren't we?

23:48.042 --> 23:52.042
We use our imagination
to conjure the unthinkable.

23:52.042 --> 23:56.583
And since our readers,
most of them at least,

23:56.583 --> 24:00.375
don't know what it's like
to murder someone,

24:00.375 --> 24:03.542
authenticity is debatable.

24:05.750 --> 24:10.167
Now with that, I have
your first assignment.

24:12.583 --> 24:15.375
How do any of you expect
to write a good book

24:15.375 --> 24:17.458
about murder mystery
if none of you know

24:17.458 --> 24:20.750
how the killer
does the dark deed?

24:21.542 --> 24:24.208
The devil is in
the details, folks.

24:24.208 --> 24:30.000
So, I want each and every one
of you to do the unthinkable.

24:30.875 --> 24:35.958
I want you to plan
the perfect murder.

24:36.708 --> 24:40.708
Three pages. No more. No less.

24:48.167 --> 24:51.375
(panting)

24:51.375 --> 24:53.167
- How are you not dying
right now?

24:53.167 --> 24:54.583
(sighing)

24:54.583 --> 24:56.042
- I told you it'd be tough.

24:56.833 --> 25:01.375
Try doing this after a 2.4 mile
swim and 100 miles on a bike.

25:01.375 --> 25:03.125
- If there is a swim
involved in this,

25:03.125 --> 25:05.333
then we are not friends anymore.
(laughing)

25:06.042 --> 25:09.375
(sighing)
- So, you're gonna have a class

25:09.375 --> 25:11.208
full of potential
murderers, then?

25:11.208 --> 25:12.750
- It's just an assignment.

25:13.667 --> 25:16.458
- How would you do it?
- Do what?

25:16.458 --> 25:17.500
- Kill me.

25:18.208 --> 25:21.000
- Well, after this workout
you just put me through,

25:21.000 --> 25:25.875
I'd make sure it was slow
and very, very painful.

25:25.875 --> 25:28.042
(laughing)
- Like your run out there today?

25:28.042 --> 25:29.125
- Okay, okay.

25:33.375 --> 25:35.250
(knocking on door)

25:40.708 --> 25:43.875
- Pretty jumpy for a woman
who writes murder so well.

25:50.833 --> 25:52.542
(sighing)
Thanks for coming

25:52.542 --> 25:54.000
all the way across campus.

25:54.000 --> 25:55.750
I thought it'd be
more comfortable to read in here

25:55.750 --> 25:58.375
than some small office
or cold lecture hall.

25:58.375 --> 26:00.375
Can I get you anything to drink?

26:00.375 --> 26:03.042
Coffee, wine?
- No, thanks.

26:03.042 --> 26:07.292
- All right, well,
sorry for the uh, hard copies.

26:07.292 --> 26:10.042
I know your generation has an
affinity for all things digital,

26:10.042 --> 26:14.625
but uh, there is just something
pure about reading actual paper.

26:15.292 --> 26:16.917
- Professor Dorr would agree.

26:18.000 --> 26:21.083
- Mm-hmm. He and I
have a lot in common.

26:22.208 --> 26:23.292
Including you.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.542
By the way,
how's your writing going?

26:31.167 --> 26:33.625
Oh, I know that look well.

26:35.125 --> 26:37.750
- It's practically
writing itself.

26:39.292 --> 26:41.917
- Well, shall we?

26:41.917 --> 26:42.958
- We shall.

26:46.042 --> 26:49.042
(soft music)

27:06.625 --> 27:10.083
So, what'd you think?
Any standouts?

27:10.083 --> 27:12.542
- Hmm, maybe some potential.
What about you?

27:12.542 --> 27:14.208
- Truth?

27:14.208 --> 27:15.958
- Always.

27:17.708 --> 27:20.083
- I think these people
have seen way too many movies.

27:20.083 --> 27:22.792
That's what I see
in their writing.

27:22.792 --> 27:25.750
- You know, the methodology
of a killer is the key

27:25.750 --> 27:27.833
to any successful
murder mystery.

27:27.833 --> 27:30.708
I mean, anybody can just follow
somebody home and attack 'em.

27:30.708 --> 27:32.583
Sadly, we see that
happen every day.

27:32.583 --> 27:35.417
But what sets a great
murder mystery apart

27:35.417 --> 27:37.167
from all of the terrible murders

27:37.167 --> 27:42.042
that we see on the news
every day is... ingenuity.

27:42.042 --> 27:46.875
I mean, that's what makes for
a compelling fictional killer.

27:48.125 --> 27:50.708
- And no one captured
your imagination?

27:53.750 --> 27:58.125
- This uh... David Freeman.

27:59.417 --> 28:02.083
- Professor Dorr's TA.
(chuckling)

28:02.083 --> 28:04.917
Yeah, the uh...
- Miles Blake superfan?

28:04.917 --> 28:06.000
- Hmm...

28:06.875 --> 28:10.167
Yeah, I run into one or two
of 'em at every event.

28:10.167 --> 28:14.792
Eh, they're mostly harmless,
but uh, try to steer 'em
in the right direction.

28:27.500 --> 28:30.083
(eerie music)

28:42.542 --> 28:45.750
(ominous music)

28:52.083 --> 28:53.958
(sighing)

28:59.167 --> 29:00.708
(sighing)

29:10.375 --> 29:12.333
(rustling)

29:14.458 --> 29:17.458
(suspenseful music)

29:36.917 --> 29:38.792
- Hey, are you home?

29:41.625 --> 29:43.792
(indistinct chatter)

29:51.583 --> 29:52.500
(knocking on door)

29:53.167 --> 29:54.417
- Hey.

29:54.417 --> 29:56.333
Come in.
It's all right.

30:09.417 --> 30:12.042
See? Not that hard.

30:14.417 --> 30:16.250
(soft music playing)

30:31.583 --> 30:33.917
- I wish I had
the courage you have.

30:34.542 --> 30:36.417
I mean, look at me.

30:36.417 --> 30:39.750
I'm a wreck. I've walked
that campus for six years now.

30:39.750 --> 30:42.208
I've never felt anything
like this.

30:43.083 --> 30:46.000
- Well, you were just
in a creepy old house.

30:46.000 --> 30:47.875
- Beautiful house.
- Okay.

30:47.875 --> 30:51.417
Creepy, old, beautiful house,

30:51.417 --> 30:53.542
with the top murder
mystery author,

30:53.542 --> 30:56.250
reading multiple plans
for multiple murders.

30:56.250 --> 30:59.542
- I suppose it could've
triggered my imagination
a little bit.

30:59.542 --> 31:01.083
- You're a writer.

31:01.083 --> 31:04.167
Conjuring scary situations
is pretty much your thing.

31:05.042 --> 31:08.750
Now, let's talk about
this intimate little night

31:08.750 --> 31:10.042
with Professor Handsome, hmm?

31:10.042 --> 31:11.417
- Call him that one
more time...

31:11.417 --> 31:12.708
(laughing)

31:12.708 --> 31:14.542
It's not like that.

31:14.542 --> 31:17.208
He's not my type.
- Oh, right.

31:17.208 --> 31:21.958
Successful, charming,
talented, handsome.

31:22.667 --> 31:24.333
Oh, stay clear of that.

31:26.583 --> 31:29.000
(laughing)

31:29.000 --> 31:31.833
- He was so cute though.
- Very.

31:32.542 --> 31:34.375
Let's head over to Fratelli's.

31:34.375 --> 31:36.375
Usually plenty
of cute guys there.

31:36.375 --> 31:39.292
- Uh, I can't.
I have an essay to finish.

31:39.292 --> 31:43.208
- Come on, Kate, peer pressure.

31:43.208 --> 31:46.708
(laughing)
- Thanks. Next time, for sure.

31:46.708 --> 31:48.375
- Fine, suit yourself.

31:48.375 --> 31:51.625
You want us to at least
walk you home first?

31:53.208 --> 31:55.708
- I'll be fine.
It's not that far.

31:55.708 --> 31:57.292
And I'll keep my phone
in my hand.

31:57.875 --> 32:00.042
(all): Bye!

32:09.458 --> 32:11.458
(phone chiming)

32:20.042 --> 32:21.458
(branch cracking)

32:43.958 --> 32:45.625
(branch cracking)

33:02.042 --> 33:03.625
(phone ringing)

33:06.125 --> 33:08.583
- Hey. What are you
doing up so early?

33:09.208 --> 33:12.042
- Just pulled an all-nighter
at the morgue.

33:12.042 --> 33:14.708
- Oh, that sounds fun.
You have any good stories?

33:16.208 --> 33:18.417
- A no dead body night
is a good night.

33:18.417 --> 33:20.125
(chuckling)
You have class today?

33:20.125 --> 33:22.542
- Yep, just getting
some writing done before.

33:22.542 --> 33:24.333
- I need coffee.
- Ditto.

33:24.333 --> 33:27.417
I will see you in five?
- Yep.

33:27.417 --> 33:33.167
But I'll warn you now,
I am in full zombie mode.

33:33.167 --> 33:34.792
- Not for long. See ya.

33:34.792 --> 33:37.667
(sirens blaring)

33:46.083 --> 33:48.750
- Mm, that is so good.

33:49.875 --> 33:52.500
(phones chiming)

33:54.208 --> 33:56.125
- What's going on?
(phone chiming)

34:00.542 --> 34:02.000
- Look!

34:02.000 --> 34:03.792
- Police investigators
have confirmed

34:03.792 --> 34:06.125
that a university student
has been reported missing

34:06.125 --> 34:07.708
since last weekend.

34:07.708 --> 34:10.542
Freshman Kate Bishop
was last seen this past Friday

34:10.542 --> 34:13.708
as she said goodbye
to friends for the short
walk home to the dorms.

34:13.708 --> 34:16.125
Her roommate reported her
missing yesterday morning,

34:16.125 --> 34:17.417
which means her whereabouts

34:17.417 --> 34:19.750
have been unknown
for nearly 72 hours.

34:19.750 --> 34:22.333
Campus police are working
with police investigators

34:22.333 --> 34:24.792
as the search
has officially begun.

34:32.708 --> 34:35.375
- Hey.
- Hmm.

34:35.375 --> 34:39.333
- Oh wow, what happened?
- Oh, yeah, shaving.

34:39.333 --> 34:42.542
Up really late writing.

34:42.542 --> 34:45.375
Didn't get much sleep.
Must've dozed off during
the morning shave.

34:45.375 --> 34:47.125
It's fascinating
how such a small,

34:47.125 --> 34:49.458
superficial cut
can bleed so much.

34:51.208 --> 34:53.208
- Did you hear about
the missing student?

34:53.208 --> 34:55.167
- Missing student?

34:55.167 --> 34:57.333
- Yeah, it's all over
the news and online.

34:57.333 --> 34:59.708
- I turn all that stuff off
when I'm writing.

34:59.708 --> 35:01.292
What happened?

35:01.292 --> 35:02.917
- She's been missing
since Friday.

35:02.917 --> 35:05.417
Went out with some friends,
walked home alone and...

35:06.375 --> 35:09.375
- Oh, my God, that's a shame.
Did you know her?

35:09.375 --> 35:11.833
- Do I know her?
Um, no, I...

35:11.833 --> 35:14.458
I suppose I've seen her
on campus a few times,
but we've never met.

35:14.458 --> 35:19.708
Hopefully she just...
went home or something.

35:19.708 --> 35:21.708
Forgot to tell someone?

35:21.708 --> 35:25.792
- Hmm, nice alternative, but...
probably not likely the case.

35:25.792 --> 35:28.042
Hey, be careful out there, okay?

35:28.042 --> 35:29.958
That's horrible.

35:29.958 --> 35:31.625
- Thanks, I will.

35:34.208 --> 35:36.750
Wow, you're usually
the first one in class.

35:37.375 --> 35:39.750
Are you okay?
You look kinda...

35:39.750 --> 35:41.667
- Yeah, must've just caught
a bug, or something.

35:41.667 --> 35:43.500
- All right, everybody.

35:44.875 --> 35:46.333
I know I look a little tired.

35:47.208 --> 35:49.042
Spent all weekend
reading your stories

35:49.042 --> 35:50.750
on how you plan
to murder people.

35:51.625 --> 35:55.125
Look, you know, for your first
assignment, not bad, right,

35:55.125 --> 35:57.792
but this is the dark
manifestations of the mind

35:57.792 --> 35:59.792
and how to harness them,
so we just need to learn

35:59.792 --> 36:01.542
how to harness these ideas
that you guys come up...

36:04.583 --> 36:06.542
(retching)

36:11.708 --> 36:14.625
(breathing heavily)

36:30.792 --> 36:32.583
- Hello?!

36:37.417 --> 36:39.458
Please!

36:41.875 --> 36:46.333
I'm sure my... my family's
worried about me!

36:50.375 --> 36:52.667
- Hi.
- Oh, hey.

36:53.375 --> 36:56.875
Whatcha got there?
- I... Gosh, the words

36:56.875 --> 36:58.542
have just been flowing.

36:58.542 --> 37:01.500
I reworked everything, took
a whole different turn with it.

37:01.500 --> 37:03.292
It's... it's become
something else entirely.

37:03.292 --> 37:05.042
Something... something better.

37:05.042 --> 37:07.875
- They do that, don't they?
- What?

37:07.875 --> 37:10.833
- Your stories... they evolve.

37:12.500 --> 37:14.583
I'll read them tonight.
Maybe we can set up a dinner

37:14.583 --> 37:16.333
later on in the week
to talk about it.

37:17.375 --> 37:20.375
- Um...
- A dinner amongst peers.

37:20.375 --> 37:23.625
- Okay, of course, yes,
that sounds nice.

37:31.417 --> 37:33.292
It's been three days now.

37:33.292 --> 37:34.792
Almost four.

37:36.417 --> 37:38.667
Doesn't look good, does it?

37:48.125 --> 37:51.167
- You don't have to do this!

37:51.167 --> 37:53.250
I haven't seen your face!

37:55.833 --> 37:57.667
(ominous music)

37:59.125 --> 38:00.917
At least some water!

38:06.208 --> 38:08.625
At least that!

38:09.917 --> 38:12.833
At least give me some water!

38:15.583 --> 38:17.792
- It is not your job
as an author

38:17.792 --> 38:20.583
to give your readers
something expectant.

38:20.583 --> 38:25.000
No. Give them
something unexpected!

38:25.000 --> 38:29.375
That's what they look for
in every book that they choose,

38:29.375 --> 38:32.708
and it is our duty
to provide that.

38:41.292 --> 38:43.208
- Thanks for walking with me.

38:43.208 --> 38:45.125
- Hey, strength in numbers.

38:45.125 --> 38:47.458
- What do you think
happened to her?

38:48.375 --> 38:49.792
- I don't know.

38:50.500 --> 38:52.333
And I don't wanna
even imagine it.

38:53.417 --> 38:55.708
I need a drink.
Dinner and cocktails?

38:56.750 --> 38:59.417
- Okay, I'm gonna tell you
something, but I need you

38:59.417 --> 39:02.417
to promise that you're not
gonna be well... you.

39:02.417 --> 39:04.542
- Huh, can't wait
to hear this one.

39:04.542 --> 39:06.708
- I have dinner plans with him.

39:06.708 --> 39:10.333
- I knew it. Oh, this whole
"he's not my type" thing

39:10.333 --> 39:12.125
that you've been
blabbing on about?

39:12.125 --> 39:14.375
- It's just dinner.
Between peers.

39:14.375 --> 39:16.375
- Between peers?

39:16.375 --> 39:19.667
- Two peers having dinner,
talking about writing.

39:19.667 --> 39:21.833
My writing, specifically.
Nothing more.

39:21.833 --> 39:25.042
- Oh, God, if I was at dinner
with that man,

39:25.042 --> 39:27.500
business would be the last thing
we would be talking about.

39:27.500 --> 39:30.417
I'd be--
- Okay, okay, I get it!

39:32.042 --> 39:33.750
(crying)

39:46.000 --> 39:47.125
- No! Please!

39:48.250 --> 39:51.458
Come back!
I won't tell them anything.

39:52.000 --> 39:54.458
(suspenseful music)

40:25.208 --> 40:28.417
No! No! Please!

40:28.417 --> 40:30.875
Please! Come back!

40:34.708 --> 40:36.750
(soft jazz music)

40:43.458 --> 40:45.250
- I'm sorry I'm late.

40:45.917 --> 40:47.500
Your book wouldn't let me go.

40:51.542 --> 40:53.125
I'm blown away.

40:53.125 --> 40:54.500
- Really?

40:54.500 --> 40:55.750
- Really.

40:55.750 --> 40:58.375
I want to take this
to my publisher.

40:58.375 --> 41:01.208
Right away. Seriously,
they're that good.

41:01.208 --> 41:03.750
- You're sure? I mean,
I feel like I was kind of going

41:03.750 --> 41:07.125
off the beaten path and...
- That's what I liked about it!

41:07.125 --> 41:09.542
I mean, there's nothing like it.

41:09.542 --> 41:11.458
And that villain...

41:13.792 --> 41:16.250
- Well, there has
to be something.

41:16.250 --> 41:19.375
You say it yourself, Professor
Dorr says it all the time,

41:19.375 --> 41:22.042
criticism is invaluable
as a writer.

41:22.042 --> 41:26.125
Critique the work, please.
Just anything.

41:27.083 --> 41:29.708
- All right.
Fair enough.

41:31.833 --> 41:37.625
You could push the envelope
even further, if you're willing.

41:38.333 --> 41:40.875
- I am. I really am.

41:40.875 --> 41:42.500
- All right.

41:44.542 --> 41:48.083
If it's missing anything,
it's um...

41:53.208 --> 41:54.500
- What?

41:56.000 --> 41:59.583
- You haven't fully
tapped into the realistic
dynamics of murder.

42:00.583 --> 42:02.167
Not just how
the captive victim feels,

42:02.167 --> 42:05.208
but how the killer feels,
as well, all right?

42:05.208 --> 42:10.667
There is a thrill of getting
into the mind of a killer.

42:10.667 --> 42:13.542
Seeing what they see.

42:13.542 --> 42:15.500
Feeling what they feel.

42:15.500 --> 42:18.042
You have to tap into that

42:18.042 --> 42:21.792
and go to those
uncomfortable places.

42:24.042 --> 42:26.250
- How do I do that?

42:30.750 --> 42:33.000
- I want you to think
about Kate.

42:36.292 --> 42:38.375
The missing student.

42:38.375 --> 42:40.208
- What?

42:40.208 --> 42:42.292
- Look... statistically,

42:42.292 --> 42:45.000
if somebody's been missing
for more than 48 hours,

42:45.000 --> 42:46.875
it most likely means
they're dead, right?

42:46.875 --> 42:49.583
So, that usually points
to homicide.

42:49.583 --> 42:53.042
So, I want you to not only
put yourself

42:53.042 --> 42:55.708
in Kate's mind frame
upon abduction,

42:55.708 --> 42:59.917
but also the possible killer's
mind frame as well.

43:04.583 --> 43:08.000
The possibilities
are enthralling.

43:08.000 --> 43:11.708
That is where you push
the envelope.

43:11.708 --> 43:14.708
You just have to conjure up
what happened to her.

43:14.708 --> 43:16.875
You capture that,

43:16.875 --> 43:18.917
put that on the pages...

43:20.375 --> 43:22.333
...you have a bestseller.

43:22.333 --> 43:24.833
(eerie music)

43:29.083 --> 43:30.458
I'm sorry.

43:30.458 --> 43:32.375
- Oh no, it's okay.
It's um...

43:32.375 --> 43:34.833
- Oh, no, no, no.
It's not. I'm...

43:35.792 --> 43:38.375
Look, I get like this
when I write.

43:38.375 --> 43:39.625
I went too far.

43:40.333 --> 43:41.750
I'm sorry.

43:56.417 --> 43:58.917
- I wanna go swimming.

43:58.917 --> 44:00.750
- Are you crazy?
It's freezing!

44:00.750 --> 44:02.583
- Come on, chicken!

44:02.583 --> 44:04.917
Hey, I know a way we can
keep each other warm.

44:07.792 --> 44:09.292
Coming, or not?

44:13.458 --> 44:14.708
What's wrong?

44:14.708 --> 44:16.958
Lexi, come back over here.

44:16.958 --> 44:18.792
Why? We're just
gonna go swimming.

44:18.792 --> 44:20.583
- Seriously, Lexi!

44:20.583 --> 44:22.792
There's something over there.

44:26.625 --> 44:28.792
(screaming)

44:42.500 --> 44:44.042
(phone ringing)

44:46.417 --> 44:48.458
- I'm home. Alone.

44:48.458 --> 44:50.333
No Professor Handsome in sight.

44:52.125 --> 44:54.000
- Turn on your TV.

44:56.917 --> 44:59.333
- Authorities have confirmed
that the body

44:59.333 --> 45:01.667
is that of Kate Bishop,

45:01.667 --> 45:05.083
the university freshman that
went missing just last weekend.

45:05.083 --> 45:08.083
Student ID
and other identification

45:08.083 --> 45:10.208
were found near the body.

45:11.458 --> 45:13.375
- I'm glad you're safe.

45:13.375 --> 45:17.917
- I'm fine. It's um...
It's Kate, the missing student.

45:18.708 --> 45:20.208
They've already
identified her body.

45:20.208 --> 45:22.042
- Oh, my God.

45:41.667 --> 45:44.000
- Now, as a visitor
to your university,

45:44.000 --> 45:47.042
I just wanna offer my deepest
condolences to you all.

45:47.042 --> 45:50.542
I can't imagine what you all
are feeling right now and...

45:50.542 --> 45:52.250
I um...

45:54.250 --> 45:56.542
I've decided to postpone classes
for the rest of the week,

45:56.542 --> 45:59.458
in Kate's honor, to give you
all an opportunity to,

45:59.458 --> 46:00.958
you know, mourn her passing.

46:01.875 --> 46:05.292
I am... so sorry.

46:06.583 --> 46:07.833
Thank you.

46:28.292 --> 46:31.000
- I can't, it's just...
it's so horrible.

46:31.000 --> 46:32.292
I thought that they--

46:32.292 --> 46:34.417
- Can't believe how naïve
kids can be.

46:35.833 --> 46:37.792
They think they're
so invincible.

46:39.417 --> 46:42.208
I mean, one minute
they're drinking at a bar.

46:42.208 --> 46:44.042
The next, they're driving away
in their car,

46:44.042 --> 46:46.208
jumping into freezing
cold water. It's just...

46:47.875 --> 46:50.083
...so naïve!

46:50.083 --> 46:51.875
- Is that what you think it was?

46:51.875 --> 46:54.125
I mean, you said it yourself
that if they're not found

46:54.125 --> 46:56.208
after 48 hours,
it's likely that--

46:56.208 --> 46:57.875
- This is the real world,
Ashley.

46:57.875 --> 47:00.000
Not everything's a mystery
to be solved.

47:05.458 --> 47:08.208
- Have you noticed that David's
been missing from class?

47:09.500 --> 47:11.875
He hasn't been there in the past
few days, and when he was,

47:11.875 --> 47:14.875
he seemed kind of um...
off and...

47:14.875 --> 47:16.417
- You're not saying...

47:17.083 --> 47:18.917
- No, I mean, um...

47:18.917 --> 47:20.375
I don't know, just...

47:21.875 --> 47:24.542
- There's a line you can't cross
as a writer, Ashley.

47:24.542 --> 47:27.250
A line where you start
to believe your own words
are reality.

47:27.875 --> 47:29.917
We're not detectives.

47:29.917 --> 47:32.542
We tell lies for a living, okay?

47:32.542 --> 47:34.167
Dark ones.

47:34.167 --> 47:36.208
- No, I think you misunderstood.

47:36.208 --> 47:38.250
I was just wondering
where he is.

47:39.875 --> 47:41.375
(sirens blaring)

48:17.375 --> 48:19.000
Damn it, Ashley.

48:30.708 --> 48:33.417
David? Hello?

49:11.417 --> 49:13.708
- What are you doing here?
(gasps)

49:13.708 --> 49:15.708
- I am so sorry.

49:15.708 --> 49:17.000
Um... I just walked in.

49:17.000 --> 49:18.875
The door was open
when I knocked,

49:18.875 --> 49:20.417
so I thought
you might be in here.

49:29.333 --> 49:32.333
I just wanted to come
check on you.

49:32.333 --> 49:34.625
You haven't been
in class lately.

49:35.208 --> 49:38.167
- You were checking on me?
- Yeah!

49:38.167 --> 49:43.250
Uh, well not me, Miles...
I mean, Mr. Blake was.

49:44.167 --> 49:46.208
- Miles Blake
was asking about me?

49:46.208 --> 49:47.542
- Yeah.

49:48.083 --> 49:50.083
Yeah, he noticed
you hadn't been in class,

49:50.083 --> 49:52.125
so he wanted to make sure
everything was okay.

49:55.583 --> 49:57.292
- I came down with a flu.

49:57.292 --> 49:59.667
My immune system
has never been that great,

49:59.667 --> 50:01.375
back since I was a kid.

50:01.375 --> 50:03.708
So, when I... when I do get
sick, it hits pretty bad.

50:04.292 --> 50:06.042
- I'm sorry to hear that.

50:08.208 --> 50:10.500
- Um... Do you want...

50:10.500 --> 50:12.250
Do you want some water,
something to drink?

50:12.250 --> 50:14.250
- Oh no, I'm okay. Thanks.

50:17.083 --> 50:19.167
- Sorry, I know...
I know it's a mess in here.

50:19.167 --> 50:21.042
- No, it's um--
- I spent a few nights

50:21.042 --> 50:22.708
at the university hospital.

50:22.708 --> 50:26.083
They saw how dehydrated I was
and it was pretty bad, so.

50:26.083 --> 50:28.542
You know, I normally
clean up during the week

50:28.542 --> 50:30.167
and I missed that,
obviously, so.

50:30.167 --> 50:33.167
- So, you're just getting
back today?

50:39.833 --> 50:43.042
- Yeah, I'm still a little weak.

50:43.917 --> 50:45.542
On the mend, though.

50:49.458 --> 50:51.375
They inspire me.

50:53.208 --> 50:56.500
Yeah, every time I see

50:56.500 --> 50:59.792
something amazing
he's written...

51:02.042 --> 51:07.542
A plot point, a twist,
character arc note...

51:08.042 --> 51:09.833
I make note of it.

51:13.208 --> 51:15.583
I suppose it's a little weird.

51:15.583 --> 51:17.417
- No. No, it's not.

51:20.375 --> 51:23.292
- Not everyone has
the raw talent you have.

51:24.833 --> 51:29.417
Others have to work and study
to write as good as he does.

51:30.208 --> 51:33.500
- Oh, no,
I'm nothing like him.

51:35.083 --> 51:36.833
- He thinks you are.

51:37.708 --> 51:39.208
So does Professor Dorr.

51:41.375 --> 51:43.292
Story of my life, Ashley.

51:45.875 --> 51:48.083
Everybody underestimates me.

51:50.875 --> 51:52.875
Underestimates
what I'm capable of.

51:58.333 --> 52:00.458
- Well, not Miles Blake.

52:01.292 --> 52:02.875
- What do you mean?

52:02.875 --> 52:05.875
- Yours was the only one
that he said had potential.

52:07.792 --> 52:10.708
- He said that?
- Yeah!

52:10.708 --> 52:13.208
So, I think if he's ever short
with you or anything,

52:13.208 --> 52:16.083
he's just trying
to push you harder.

52:16.083 --> 52:18.583
So, I wouldn't worry
about it too much.

52:18.583 --> 52:20.250
He's a fan.

52:21.792 --> 52:22.917
- A fan.

52:24.833 --> 52:25.792
- Yeah.

52:28.958 --> 52:31.958
- I was thinking about maybe
seeing him tomorrow.

52:31.958 --> 52:33.625
About my paper.

52:34.958 --> 52:36.708
A new book idea.

52:36.708 --> 52:39.625
- No, you should.
Yeah, go for it!

52:41.167 --> 52:43.375
Writing notes on the margins
of his books.

52:43.375 --> 52:45.042
I'm gonna remember that.

52:45.042 --> 52:46.542
Smart thinking.

52:47.375 --> 52:49.375
- Why did you really come here?

52:51.333 --> 52:54.583
- Like I said, uh, Miles Blake
was asking about you.

52:56.083 --> 52:58.250
Oh, by the way um...

52:58.250 --> 53:00.292
class doesn't pick up
'til next week.

53:01.708 --> 53:04.708
Thought I'd let you know.
Save you the walk.

53:04.708 --> 53:05.833
- Why?

53:06.917 --> 53:10.792
- Didn't you hear the news
about the missing student?

53:13.917 --> 53:16.500
- Kate Bishop?
- Yeah.

53:17.875 --> 53:18.792
- No.

53:20.375 --> 53:23.875
I was either sleeping
or reading in the hospital.

53:25.375 --> 53:26.667
Did they find her?

53:27.917 --> 53:31.375
- Yeah. Um... her body washed up

53:31.375 --> 53:33.583
on the campus shores
of the lake.

53:34.417 --> 53:36.417
They think she may have drowned.

53:39.083 --> 53:40.333
- Drowned.

53:44.125 --> 53:45.625
That's too bad.

53:51.292 --> 53:53.792
Did you read my assignment?
- No.

53:53.792 --> 53:56.583
We split up the pile.
I didn't get a chance to.

53:57.708 --> 53:59.625
- Did he tell you
what it was about?

54:00.542 --> 54:04.750
- No. Murder, I'm assuming.

54:08.667 --> 54:12.125
- I was thinking
about what he said in class,

54:12.125 --> 54:13.708
about research.

54:14.292 --> 54:16.125
- Research?

54:16.125 --> 54:19.500
- You know, in a perfect world,

54:19.500 --> 54:23.625
the only way to offer
true authenticity

54:23.625 --> 54:26.375
would be to commit
a murder yourself.

54:27.208 --> 54:29.417
- He was joking, though.

54:29.417 --> 54:31.292
You know that, right?

54:31.292 --> 54:32.750
- But imagine...

54:34.458 --> 54:36.375
...if someone actually did that?

54:38.333 --> 54:39.917
Where they took it that far...

54:45.583 --> 54:48.667
- Um... Well, I hope
you feel better.

54:48.667 --> 54:51.042
I'll see you in class
next week.

55:13.000 --> 55:14.375
(phone beeping)

55:14.375 --> 55:16.625
(Miles on phone):
In an ideal world,

55:16.625 --> 55:19.583
we'd just commit
the murder ourselves, right?

55:19.583 --> 55:22.750
That's the only way to offer
the reader true authenticity.

55:23.792 --> 55:29.625
- It is such a shame seeing
someone pass away so young.

55:29.625 --> 55:31.375
- Did you have her
in any classes?

55:31.375 --> 55:36.458
- Yeah, I did.
She is... was, very smart.

55:36.458 --> 55:38.625
Very determined.

55:38.625 --> 55:42.542
You know, she reminded me
of a certain other student

55:42.542 --> 55:44.750
that has been in my life
for the past few years.

55:45.833 --> 55:48.875
Ashley, what is it?

55:48.875 --> 55:50.583
- It's nothing.

55:53.542 --> 55:56.458
You know how you told us to
trust our guts, our instincts?

55:56.458 --> 55:58.208
- Yes, of course.

55:58.208 --> 55:59.875
Why do you ask?

56:04.208 --> 56:06.500
- Detectives.
Time to learn.

56:08.958 --> 56:10.708
- What is it?

56:11.542 --> 56:13.833
- Well, aside from
the tinting of the skin

56:13.833 --> 56:17.667
and the shrunken eyes,
her organs in the area
of the galea over here,

56:17.667 --> 56:20.208
are showing extreme signs
of dehydration.

56:20.208 --> 56:22.625
- Dehydration? She drowned.

56:26.417 --> 56:31.125
- What he said,
and how he said it...

56:31.125 --> 56:33.542
about taking that far.

56:33.542 --> 56:37.042
- Ashley, David is
a unique individual,

56:37.042 --> 56:39.667
I'll give you that,
but he is no killer.

56:39.667 --> 56:42.208
- Haven't we heard that
before in our society?

56:42.208 --> 56:45.917
Right before bodies are found
in our neighbor's basement.

56:47.125 --> 56:49.458
I'm... I'm so sorry.

56:49.458 --> 56:51.208
I... don't know why I said that.

56:51.208 --> 56:54.333
- Have you heard
of Occam's razor?

56:54.958 --> 56:57.708
- Sure, the most simple
explanation...

56:57.708 --> 56:59.333
- Is the most likely answer.

57:00.125 --> 57:03.292
Getting rid of all the
unnecessary information,

57:03.292 --> 57:08.000
speculation, out of the way,
is the fastest way to the truth.

57:08.000 --> 57:11.208
Now, tell me,
what makes more sense,

57:11.208 --> 57:13.792
that David is a skilled murderer

57:13.792 --> 57:17.083
who is able and ready
to hide in plain sight,

57:17.083 --> 57:20.958
or that the girl drowned
in a terrible accident?

57:32.875 --> 57:34.458
- I'm a writer.

57:35.042 --> 57:37.708
I should be able to find
the words for how sorry I am

57:37.708 --> 57:39.542
for the way that I acted.

57:40.458 --> 57:42.042
- It's okay.

57:42.042 --> 57:44.667
Everyone handles
these things differently.

57:45.458 --> 57:47.000
- I was out of line.

57:48.917 --> 57:51.625
- Well, so was I.

57:51.625 --> 57:55.000
- You know,
I had a brother growing up.

57:58.583 --> 58:00.792
He was a few years older
than me, and he drowned

58:00.792 --> 58:02.958
in a river after a night
of drinking.

58:04.708 --> 58:07.750
They didn't find his body
for a few days.

58:09.125 --> 58:12.500
- I'm so sorry.
I had no idea.

58:12.500 --> 58:14.167
- No, how could you.

58:14.750 --> 58:17.958
He's not in my bio, I don't talk
about him in interviews.

58:17.958 --> 58:20.375
Grief kinda turned him
into a family secret.

58:21.083 --> 58:24.042
Doesn't give me the permission
to use it against anybody,

58:24.042 --> 58:25.208
especially you.

58:27.583 --> 58:30.542
Anyway, back to writing.

58:30.542 --> 58:33.667
I'll see you in class next week?
- Of course.

58:33.667 --> 58:36.167
Oh, and Miles?
- Yes, Ashley.

58:36.708 --> 58:39.250
- Has the book told you
what it's about yet?

58:41.125 --> 58:44.458
It's about the limits
of human beings.

58:44.458 --> 58:47.125
What happens when we push
ourselves too far.

58:47.875 --> 58:49.458
- That's all
you're gonna give me?

58:50.000 --> 58:51.833
- About a brilliant detective

58:51.833 --> 58:53.542
who's trying to catch
her murderer,

58:53.542 --> 58:56.750
only to fall for the very traps
she knows to avoid.

58:58.875 --> 59:00.208
- Not bad.

59:01.125 --> 59:02.542
- It's a start!

59:12.417 --> 59:14.750
(knocking on door)
- Come on, girl!

59:14.750 --> 59:16.958
It's time for that morning fuel!

59:20.875 --> 59:24.542
Hey! D'you go for coffee
without me?

59:25.208 --> 59:27.208
Are you okay?

59:27.208 --> 59:29.458
- First autopsy last night.

59:29.458 --> 59:31.000
- That bad?

59:31.000 --> 59:32.833
- Normally, it probably
wouldn't have been,

59:32.833 --> 59:36.542
but it was... it was her.

59:36.542 --> 59:38.917
Kate Bishop.
- Oh, my God, Jordan.

59:39.458 --> 59:41.833
- Detectives finally came in.

59:41.833 --> 59:44.792
I was hoping they would've done
it sooner, when I wasn't there.

59:44.792 --> 59:47.875
I mean, I need
the experience, but...

59:47.875 --> 59:49.917
- But like, are you okay?

59:50.875 --> 59:52.833
(sighing)
- I will be.

59:52.833 --> 59:54.833
Just need some rest.

59:56.292 --> 59:58.083
- What was it like?

59:58.958 --> 01:00:00.167
- Not good.

01:00:00.833 --> 01:00:02.875
I guess I can tell you
the basics.

01:00:02.875 --> 01:00:04.833
But there are details
you need to promise me

01:00:04.833 --> 01:00:07.458
you won't share until
they're public... with anyone.

01:00:07.458 --> 01:00:09.083
- Yeah, of course.

01:00:10.167 --> 01:00:11.333
- She drowned.

01:00:12.708 --> 01:00:15.833
But they found
some strange elements.

01:00:16.667 --> 01:00:18.958
First off, she was
severely dehydrated.

01:00:18.958 --> 01:00:21.042
- Can you be dehydrated
after drowning?

01:00:21.042 --> 01:00:25.833
- Yeah, of course.
But... what they saw...

01:00:27.208 --> 01:00:30.292
it was consistent
with someone that would've
died of dehydration

01:00:30.292 --> 01:00:31.958
over the course of a few days.

01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:36.375
And from what they heard
from witnesses,

01:00:36.375 --> 01:00:37.833
the night she was last seen,

01:00:37.833 --> 01:00:39.750
she wasn't even
drinking alcohol,

01:00:39.750 --> 01:00:42.042
so how was she dehydrated
the same night

01:00:42.042 --> 01:00:44.333
she was throwing back
lemon ice waters?

01:00:45.208 --> 01:00:48.208
And that's not even the weirdest
part about the autopsy.

01:00:48.208 --> 01:00:50.750
The water in her lungs...

01:00:52.250 --> 01:00:54.333
...it wasn't from the lake.

01:00:55.083 --> 01:00:57.250
- But that doesn't make
any sense.

01:00:58.333 --> 01:01:02.333
- She drowned long before being
put in those lake waters.

01:01:06.708 --> 01:01:09.167
Look, I'm like
the walking dead here.

01:01:09.167 --> 01:01:10.875
(chuckling)

01:01:10.875 --> 01:01:13.917
How about after I get
some sleep,

01:01:13.917 --> 01:01:16.292
dinner and a friendly face?

01:01:18.042 --> 01:01:19.500
Ashley?

01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:21.667
- Oh, um, sorry.

01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:26.042
Can we raincheck?
Tomorrow, for sure.

01:01:26.042 --> 01:01:28.875
I just... I'm so close to
nailing that final act and ...

01:01:28.875 --> 01:01:30.792
- I see those gears turning.
(chuckling)

01:01:30.792 --> 01:01:32.792
Raincheck for sure.

01:01:32.792 --> 01:01:34.417
Good night.

01:01:34.417 --> 01:01:36.667
Or good morning, I guess.

01:01:38.042 --> 01:01:39.875
- Get some rest.

01:01:39.875 --> 01:01:41.958
And hey, everything's
gonna be okay.

01:01:48.042 --> 01:01:52.708
- Hey. You think I'm still cut
out for this detective stuff?

01:01:54.292 --> 01:01:57.625
- Take a look on that wall
of adventures of yours.

01:01:57.625 --> 01:02:00.125
You're capable
of anything, Jordan.

01:02:00.125 --> 01:02:01.708
Love you.

01:02:01.708 --> 01:02:03.917
- Love you back.

01:02:13.708 --> 01:02:15.250
(knocking on door)

01:02:21.542 --> 01:02:22.833
- David.

01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:27.042
David uh... Freeman, right?

01:02:27.042 --> 01:02:28.542
- Yes.

01:02:28.542 --> 01:02:31.125
Um, Mr. Blake--
- No, no. Miles.

01:02:31.917 --> 01:02:34.708
(chuckling)
- Miles. I um...

01:02:34.708 --> 01:02:36.167
- I haven't seen you class
this last week.

01:02:36.833 --> 01:02:39.042
- That's partly why I'm here.

01:02:39.042 --> 01:02:40.583
I wanted to apologize.

01:02:40.583 --> 01:02:41.875
I was actually
in the hospital.

01:02:41.875 --> 01:02:44.083
- Oh no. Everything okay?

01:02:44.625 --> 01:02:46.583
- I am. I am now.

01:02:46.583 --> 01:02:48.208
- Great.

01:02:48.208 --> 01:02:50.583
No apology necessary.
What was the other thing?

01:02:51.208 --> 01:02:55.333
- I um... I wanted to talk
to you about my paper.

01:02:55.333 --> 01:02:58.250
If you have time.
If you don't, it can wait.

01:03:00.208 --> 01:03:02.792
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have
come to your house.

01:03:02.792 --> 01:03:04.833
I overstepped.
- No, no, it's uh...

01:03:06.792 --> 01:03:09.250
That's all right.
Um, would love to talk about it.

01:03:09.250 --> 01:03:10.250
Come on in.

01:03:22.708 --> 01:03:24.208
Yeah, come here.

01:03:24.208 --> 01:03:25.333
Your paper...

01:03:26.667 --> 01:03:28.042
- Did... did you like it?

01:03:28.042 --> 01:03:29.917
- You like scotch, David?

01:03:31.042 --> 01:03:34.333
- Um... My father used
to drink it.

01:03:34.333 --> 01:03:36.500
I had some once
when I was a kid.

01:03:37.542 --> 01:03:43.958
- So, your paper...
was really well thought out.

01:03:44.875 --> 01:03:46.208
Inventive.

01:03:46.208 --> 01:03:47.667
Please.

01:03:47.667 --> 01:03:49.542
(sighing)

01:03:49.542 --> 01:03:53.042
To writers, may we escape
our inevitable defeat

01:03:53.042 --> 01:03:58.167
with grace and humility,
before our inevitable... demise.

01:04:03.583 --> 01:04:05.292
- That's from your fourth book.

01:04:06.333 --> 01:04:07.667
- I'm impressed.

01:04:07.667 --> 01:04:09.542
- I study them all.

01:04:09.542 --> 01:04:11.583
- For the writing, I hope.

01:04:13.292 --> 01:04:14.250
- Mm-hmm.

01:04:15.125 --> 01:04:17.375
Look, uh, Mr. Blake--
- Mm-mm-mm-mm.

01:04:17.375 --> 01:04:18.625
- Uh, Miles...

01:04:19.875 --> 01:04:22.000
Um, I wanted to...

01:04:23.250 --> 01:04:26.500
I wanted to talk to you
about my paper, yes,

01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:30.167
but uh, specifically
about the content.

01:04:30.958 --> 01:04:35.667
- Did seem somewhat,
uh... familiar.

01:04:36.542 --> 01:04:40.250
- That's... that's what
I wanted to talk about.

01:04:42.375 --> 01:04:43.917
- Yeah.

01:04:43.917 --> 01:04:47.792
"Her body was found
in the cold lake waters,

01:04:47.792 --> 01:04:50.542
washed up in the debris
of a fallen tree.

01:04:50.542 --> 01:04:53.000
Lifeless, wet.

01:04:53.708 --> 01:04:55.500
Waiting to be discovered."

01:04:57.958 --> 01:05:00.333
- I had nothing to do
with her death.

01:05:01.042 --> 01:05:03.875
I was sick, and then,
in the hospital.

01:05:03.875 --> 01:05:05.250
You can check the records.

01:05:05.250 --> 01:05:07.208
I'll give them permission
to release them to you.

01:05:07.208 --> 01:05:10.500
And when I got and I heard
what happened, I swear, I--

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:12.042
- David...

01:05:13.042 --> 01:05:15.417
If there's one thing
I've learned in all my years,

01:05:15.417 --> 01:05:17.833
it's that coincidences
are just a curious part

01:05:17.833 --> 01:05:19.917
of the reality
of the universe we live in.

01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:23.042
They happen, okay?

01:05:23.042 --> 01:05:25.958
I felt the exact same way
that you feel right now

01:05:25.958 --> 01:05:28.958
when I've read new stories
that had similar details

01:05:28.958 --> 01:05:31.042
to my own conjured methods.

01:05:31.042 --> 01:05:33.375
Methods of my characters,
mind you, okay.

01:05:33.375 --> 01:05:35.542
(sighing)

01:05:36.667 --> 01:05:38.208
I won't say a word to anyone.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.042
You don't strike me
as the killing type.

01:05:42.583 --> 01:05:43.917
Okay?

01:05:46.083 --> 01:05:49.542
Now, what I did find intriguing

01:05:49.542 --> 01:05:52.208
was the methodology
that you used for your killer.

01:05:53.667 --> 01:05:57.125
It was... inventive.

01:06:01.292 --> 01:06:04.167
- I wasn't sure if it was
too unbelievable.

01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:07.792
- "They would never know,

01:06:07.792 --> 01:06:10.667
their unskilled minds to the
ways of a killer mastermind."

01:06:10.667 --> 01:06:12.875
That's a little heavy-handed.
I'm gonna let it slide.

01:06:12.875 --> 01:06:15.208
"That the girl, the victim,

01:06:15.208 --> 01:06:17.292
never stepped foot in a lake

01:06:17.292 --> 01:06:20.292
when she was among the living,
that she, in fact,

01:06:20.292 --> 01:06:22.750
drowned 50 miles away in a tub.

01:06:23.958 --> 01:06:28.083
Lungs full of fresh,
suburban waters."

01:06:30.083 --> 01:06:34.083
Macabre, indeed,
but you've got some talent.

01:06:35.208 --> 01:06:37.375
A good eye for
a compelling hook.

01:06:41.292 --> 01:06:43.542
Let's have another drink before
I have to go back to writing.

01:06:43.542 --> 01:06:44.583
Thanks.

01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:46.375
- Um...

01:06:49.042 --> 01:06:50.875
I'm actually starting
a new book.

01:06:50.875 --> 01:06:52.333
- Oh, good for you!

01:06:53.083 --> 01:06:55.000
Care to tell me what it's about?

01:06:55.708 --> 01:06:57.333
Promise I won't steal it.

01:07:06.167 --> 01:07:09.625
- It's actually inspired by
something you said in class.

01:07:10.875 --> 01:07:12.750
About research.

01:07:14.208 --> 01:07:16.625
And how the only way to offer
true authenticity

01:07:16.625 --> 01:07:19.042
when it comes to seeing the
world through a killer's eyes

01:07:19.042 --> 01:07:22.042
is to--
- Commit the murder yourself.

01:07:23.792 --> 01:07:26.083
You know I was joking, right?

01:07:27.083 --> 01:07:28.792
Just trying to prove a point?

01:07:33.125 --> 01:07:36.208
- But what if--
- Oh yeah, the greatest

01:07:36.208 --> 01:07:38.042
and most dangerous
question of all.

01:07:41.125 --> 01:07:42.792
What if.

01:07:53.125 --> 01:07:55.250
(upbeat music)

01:08:06.208 --> 01:08:08.292
Hello there.
(chuckling)

01:08:10.042 --> 01:08:11.542
- Hi.

01:08:11.542 --> 01:08:13.583
It's--
- Jordan.

01:08:13.583 --> 01:08:17.333
Yeah, no, I never forget
a pretty face.

01:08:18.250 --> 01:08:20.417
Or the name that goes
along with it.

01:08:20.417 --> 01:08:23.292
(chuckling)
Let me guess, girls' night out?

01:08:23.292 --> 01:08:25.083
Is Ashley coming
to meet you here?

01:08:25.083 --> 01:08:26.500
- No.

01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:28.708
I'm actually
flying solo tonight.

01:08:28.708 --> 01:08:30.125
No wing woman.

01:08:30.125 --> 01:08:31.917
She's writing.

01:08:31.917 --> 01:08:34.583
- Oh, well done, Ashley.

01:08:34.583 --> 01:08:36.167
Well done.

01:08:37.167 --> 01:08:39.375
Please, sit. Join me.

01:08:39.375 --> 01:08:41.250
Nobody should drink alone.

01:08:42.667 --> 01:08:43.792
- Not even you.

01:08:44.833 --> 01:08:46.667
(chuckling)

01:08:48.917 --> 01:08:50.333
- So...

01:08:52.667 --> 01:08:54.208
What are we drinking?

01:09:17.708 --> 01:09:18.792
Thanks.

01:09:21.167 --> 01:09:22.667
Keep the change.

01:09:33.750 --> 01:09:35.792
To... newfound friends.

01:09:35.792 --> 01:09:37.750
- Hmm. Hmm.

01:09:39.042 --> 01:09:40.583
And maybe something more?

01:09:42.542 --> 01:09:45.375
- I'm actually afraid
this is my last call.

01:09:45.375 --> 01:09:48.375
- Oh. That's what I always say.

01:09:48.375 --> 01:09:50.792
And then, many rounds later...

01:09:51.875 --> 01:09:55.708
- Would it be too forward to ask
you to go on a walk with me?

01:09:56.958 --> 01:10:00.792
It can be strictly professional
if you'd prefer.

01:10:02.250 --> 01:10:05.625
- I'm not Ashley, Miles.

01:10:05.625 --> 01:10:09.667
We don't need to... talk shop
to enjoy a walk together.

01:10:11.458 --> 01:10:13.625
- Just let me freshen up a bit?

01:10:14.667 --> 01:10:18.083
- Tell you what, I'm gonna
close out the bar tab

01:10:18.083 --> 01:10:20.417
and I will meet you outside.

01:10:22.708 --> 01:10:23.667
- Hmm.

01:10:37.875 --> 01:10:40.167
- Sorry. Sorry.

01:10:40.167 --> 01:10:42.917
- Leave it, man.
Happens all the time.

01:10:57.583 --> 01:10:59.708
- It's beautiful out, isn't it?

01:11:01.458 --> 01:11:03.375
- Quite beautiful, yes.

01:11:05.542 --> 01:11:09.000
It's hard to imagine a life
was lost in those waters.

01:11:10.208 --> 01:11:11.708
- I know.

01:11:11.708 --> 01:11:13.375
It's sad.

01:11:14.375 --> 01:11:17.042
- I hear you're quite
the swimmer, though.

01:11:17.042 --> 01:11:19.375
- Been competing my whole life.

01:11:19.375 --> 01:11:22.875
I'm starting to train
for another Ironman.

01:11:24.042 --> 01:11:25.417
- Interesting.

01:11:27.750 --> 01:11:30.458
(sighing)
Wonder what it feels like.

01:11:32.333 --> 01:11:33.667
- What...

01:11:35.375 --> 01:11:36.875
What do you mean?

01:11:39.542 --> 01:11:41.292
- When you're about to die.

01:11:42.875 --> 01:11:44.625
- What did you say?

01:11:48.708 --> 01:11:50.375
You?

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:52.417
- Think it through.

01:11:53.708 --> 01:11:56.083
Back corner table at the bar.

01:11:57.208 --> 01:11:58.917
Away from most people's view.

01:11:59.667 --> 01:12:01.958
Had to make sure
people saw me leave alone.

01:12:04.750 --> 01:12:06.000
You as well.

01:12:08.875 --> 01:12:11.333
Now piece it together.
You wanna be a detective, right?

01:12:11.333 --> 01:12:13.708
So, what's missing?

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.708
- The drinks.

01:12:19.708 --> 01:12:21.958
- Recipe I've perfected
throughout the years.

01:12:23.417 --> 01:12:25.042
To a tee.

01:12:25.583 --> 01:12:28.833
Quick estimation of body weight
to tolerance,

01:12:28.833 --> 01:12:32.583
steady stride to make sure the
blood stream carries the drug.

01:12:33.417 --> 01:12:35.042
All timed to perfection.

01:12:35.042 --> 01:12:41.333
I mean, I don't wanna brag,
but... it works quite well.

01:12:42.417 --> 01:12:44.958
- I don't... I don't...

01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:48.042
- Hey.
- I don't wanna die.

01:12:48.042 --> 01:12:49.500
- Nobody wants to die.

01:12:51.875 --> 01:12:54.042
(sirens blaring)

01:13:00.208 --> 01:13:01.458
(car door closing)

01:13:06.250 --> 01:13:07.917
(engine starting)

01:14:25.458 --> 01:14:27.000
- Come on!

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.167
(sighing)

01:14:29.167 --> 01:14:31.875
(Jordan's voicemail): Hey,
it's Jordan, you know the drill.

01:14:31.875 --> 01:14:33.958
I'll get back to you, ASAP.

01:14:35.250 --> 01:14:37.250
- Hey, it's me again.

01:14:37.250 --> 01:14:38.708
We haven't gone a couple days

01:14:38.708 --> 01:14:41.667
without talking
since, well, ever.

01:14:41.667 --> 01:14:43.667
I hope you're not ghosting me.

01:14:48.542 --> 01:14:50.000
Where are you?

01:15:00.583 --> 01:15:02.125
- It was a valiant effort.

01:15:02.708 --> 01:15:05.792
It's exactly
what I was hoping for but...

01:15:05.792 --> 01:15:09.875
I'm afraid you ran out of time
and it's... it's such a shame.

01:15:09.875 --> 01:15:13.833
It would've made for a much more
exciting ending.

01:15:14.792 --> 01:15:16.583
- I know who you are.

01:15:17.375 --> 01:15:19.500
You don't need the mask.

01:15:20.333 --> 01:15:22.625
- We all need masks.

01:15:24.083 --> 01:15:26.167
- Is that how you get
through this?

01:15:26.167 --> 01:15:27.958
You hide behind it?

01:15:27.958 --> 01:15:30.667
You think you're someone else
when you do these sick things?

01:15:31.542 --> 01:15:34.042
And then, when it's over,

01:15:34.042 --> 01:15:38.042
you take it off and you feel
good about yourself.

01:15:39.417 --> 01:15:41.125
Like someone else is doing it.

01:15:42.250 --> 01:15:45.042
- That's an excellent profile.

01:15:45.042 --> 01:15:47.750
You would've made
a great detective.

01:15:48.708 --> 01:15:51.000
- You don't have to do this.

01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:52.583
(sighing)

01:15:52.583 --> 01:15:54.292
- That's what they all say.

01:15:55.458 --> 01:15:57.125
But I do.

01:15:57.125 --> 01:15:59.042
It's the only way.

01:15:59.042 --> 01:16:01.208
- Only way to what?

01:16:03.042 --> 01:16:06.083
- The only way I know
how to write death so well.

01:16:07.708 --> 01:16:09.292
Can I offer you some water?

01:16:09.292 --> 01:16:10.875
(chuckling)

01:16:10.875 --> 01:16:12.083
- I remember what happened

01:16:12.083 --> 01:16:14.542
the last time I accepted
a drink from you.

01:16:14.542 --> 01:16:19.250
- Oh, I assure you,
this water is quite pure.

01:16:35.667 --> 01:16:37.000
- Jordan?

01:16:42.583 --> 01:16:44.292
- She's not home.

01:16:44.292 --> 01:16:45.875
- Are you sure?

01:16:45.875 --> 01:16:47.625
- Figured she left town
for the weekend.

01:16:47.625 --> 01:16:49.375
Haven't seen her since Friday.

01:16:49.375 --> 01:16:51.208
- Friday. That's the last time
I talked to her.

01:16:51.208 --> 01:16:52.750
Uh, where was she?

01:16:52.750 --> 01:16:54.917
- I saw her at Main Street Pub.

01:16:54.917 --> 01:16:57.875
- Alone?
- I think so, yeah.

01:16:59.708 --> 01:17:02.125
(ominous music)

01:17:06.625 --> 01:17:09.833
- You're sure?
- Yeah uh, she and the guy

01:17:09.833 --> 01:17:13.375
sat in the back corner,
had a few drinks together.

01:17:13.375 --> 01:17:14.625
He was a little older.

01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:20.042
- Was this him?

01:17:22.208 --> 01:17:24.542
- Yeah. That's him.

01:17:24.542 --> 01:17:26.958
Wow, is he uh...
- Did they leave together?

01:17:26.958 --> 01:17:28.958
- Uh, no.

01:17:28.958 --> 01:17:31.208
She was in the bathroom,
I think.

01:17:31.208 --> 01:17:33.125
No, he dropped a glass,
looked a little upset.

01:17:33.125 --> 01:17:35.208
You know, I figured it didn't
work out with them.

01:17:35.208 --> 01:17:37.708
Um... she left soon after.

01:17:37.708 --> 01:17:39.542
- And that was Friday?

01:17:39.542 --> 01:17:41.917
- Couple days ago, yeah.

01:17:45.083 --> 01:17:47.083
- Could you... could you
turn that up?

01:17:47.083 --> 01:17:49.000
- And the death
of a university student.

01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.250
Another student, David Freeman,

01:17:51.250 --> 01:17:55.375
was found dead in his apartment,
of an apparent suicide.

01:17:55.375 --> 01:17:57.958
On his body was a suicide note

01:17:57.958 --> 01:18:01.333
confessing to the murder
of student Kate Bishop,

01:18:01.333 --> 01:18:05.250
originally thought to have
drowned in the campus lake.

01:18:05.250 --> 01:18:07.542
The more intriguing part
of this story

01:18:07.542 --> 01:18:11.875
is that the note referred to
women, plural, that he killed.

01:18:11.875 --> 01:18:14.000
Authorities hope that
this is just a result

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.125
of a misspelling on the note,

01:18:16.125 --> 01:18:20.333
but are likely to be sending out
divers to the lake once again.

01:18:22.083 --> 01:18:24.833
- I was thinking about maybe
seeing him tomorrow.

01:18:24.833 --> 01:18:29.125
About my paper and...
a new book idea.

01:18:29.125 --> 01:18:31.208
- It was consistent with someone
that would've died

01:18:31.208 --> 01:18:33.167
of dehydration over the course
of a few days.

01:18:34.208 --> 01:18:37.833
The water in her lungs,
it wasn't from the lake.

01:18:37.833 --> 01:18:39.417
- That doesn't make any sense.

01:18:39.417 --> 01:18:43.583
- She drowned long before
being put in those lake waters.

01:18:43.583 --> 01:18:45.125
- Jordan...

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:53.833
- Help!

01:19:01.458 --> 01:19:03.083
(breathing shakily)

01:19:31.375 --> 01:19:33.000
- Miles?

01:19:34.542 --> 01:19:36.167
(door creaking)

01:19:39.792 --> 01:19:42.083
(suspenseful music)

01:19:48.083 --> 01:19:49.417
Hello?

01:19:49.417 --> 01:19:50.917
Miles?

01:19:52.708 --> 01:19:55.333
- Please!

01:19:55.333 --> 01:19:57.875
Help!

01:20:07.250 --> 01:20:10.208
- It's Ashley.
Are you in here?

01:20:28.708 --> 01:20:31.083
(breathing shakily)

01:21:19.667 --> 01:21:22.542
(eerie music)

01:21:28.708 --> 01:21:30.333
- Help.

01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:34.167
Help!

01:21:34.167 --> 01:21:35.875
Please!

01:21:38.458 --> 01:21:40.500
- Jordan? Jordan!

01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:41.542
- Ashley!

01:21:42.458 --> 01:21:45.333
Ashley! Turn off the water,
throw the hose down.

01:21:45.333 --> 01:21:46.375
- Okay!

01:21:47.042 --> 01:21:48.500
- Turn off the hose.

01:21:49.250 --> 01:21:51.167
Throw it down!
Throw it down!

01:21:51.167 --> 01:21:53.417
It's not safe,
you gotta get outta here.

01:21:55.250 --> 01:21:56.625
(grunting)

01:21:59.792 --> 01:22:01.917
(grunting)

01:22:04.792 --> 01:22:06.458
(grunting)

01:22:09.958 --> 01:22:11.667
(screaming)

01:22:11.667 --> 01:22:12.583
(grunting)

01:22:12.583 --> 01:22:14.583
(coughing)

01:22:21.875 --> 01:22:24.208
(panting, grunting)

01:22:24.208 --> 01:22:27.042
(breathing heavily)

01:22:27.042 --> 01:22:28.458
- She was strong.

01:22:30.167 --> 01:22:32.875
Stronger than the others,
just as I hoped.

01:22:32.875 --> 01:22:34.958
- How could you?

01:22:35.708 --> 01:22:38.625
- I'm not a killer, Ashley.
I don't do this for fun.

01:22:40.708 --> 01:22:42.625
I do this because I have to.

01:22:43.542 --> 01:22:46.583
At first, I was just gonna
follow 'em,

01:22:46.583 --> 01:22:51.583
I mean, just to see,
feel what it was like.

01:22:51.583 --> 01:22:54.250
But then...
(chuckling)

01:22:54.250 --> 01:22:56.833
...I couldn't stop.
(chuckling)

01:22:56.833 --> 01:23:00.125
I mean, with every new method
or murder that I conjured up,

01:23:00.125 --> 01:23:02.375
I had to know...

01:23:02.375 --> 01:23:05.167
I had to know what it felt like.

01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:09.375
I mean, you've read my books,
that's why everybody loves 'em.

01:23:10.542 --> 01:23:14.583
That's the draw
they want to know!

01:23:15.375 --> 01:23:17.000
- Why Jordan?

01:23:19.375 --> 01:23:20.750
(grunting)

01:23:20.750 --> 01:23:22.667
- The story.

01:23:24.375 --> 01:23:26.500
It's always been
about the story.

01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:30.917
I mean, I wanted to explore how
two very different characters

01:23:30.917 --> 01:23:32.500
could get killed
in the same way.

01:23:33.375 --> 01:23:35.708
I mean, Kate, she was weak.
She couldn't even swim.

01:23:35.708 --> 01:23:37.250
But...

01:23:38.042 --> 01:23:39.875
Hmm, Jordan...

01:23:39.875 --> 01:23:41.292
(chuckling)

01:23:43.042 --> 01:23:44.875
She was strong.

01:23:44.875 --> 01:23:48.417
She almost made it!

01:23:48.417 --> 01:23:49.667
Almost!

01:23:50.667 --> 01:23:52.917
(grunting)

01:23:52.917 --> 01:23:54.750
(breathing heavily)

01:23:54.750 --> 01:23:56.708
I mean, that's the story.

01:23:58.375 --> 01:24:02.708
A detective who's searching
for a killer,

01:24:02.708 --> 01:24:06.292
who drowned his victims
in a particular way.

01:24:07.292 --> 01:24:10.125
And then, he got caught
in that same trap.

01:24:10.125 --> 01:24:12.917
How would he fare? I mean,
the fact that Jordan

01:24:12.917 --> 01:24:15.458
was studying to be
a detective...

01:24:15.458 --> 01:24:17.167
(gasping)

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:19.458
That just felt right.

01:24:20.375 --> 01:24:22.542
(breathing shakily)
- You're sick.

01:24:22.542 --> 01:24:24.417
- Yeah, I admit it.

01:24:25.375 --> 01:24:29.042
After my last novel, I got
a little writer's block.

01:24:29.042 --> 01:24:30.542
- The assignment?

01:24:31.292 --> 01:24:36.375
- It's like Picasso said,
"Good artists copy.

01:24:36.375 --> 01:24:38.833
Great artists steal."

01:24:39.417 --> 01:24:41.583
(grunting, breathing heavily)

01:24:42.875 --> 01:24:44.792
- David's paper. Why David?

01:24:46.125 --> 01:24:48.333
- Somebody had to take the fall.

01:24:49.708 --> 01:24:51.542
He was the perfect cover.

01:24:53.042 --> 01:24:55.500
- You didn't even have
a brother, did you?

01:24:55.500 --> 01:24:56.750
(groaning)

01:24:56.750 --> 01:24:58.875
- You haven't been paying
attention in class.

01:24:58.875 --> 01:25:02.208
It was a necessary misdirect,

01:25:02.208 --> 01:25:05.292
meant to entice some empathy!

01:25:05.292 --> 01:25:08.417
That's what I taught you,
and it worked.

01:25:10.542 --> 01:25:11.958
Huh?!

01:25:11.958 --> 01:25:13.917
(breathing shakily)

01:25:13.917 --> 01:25:15.833
- But what about me?

01:25:15.833 --> 01:25:17.500
(sighing)

01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:19.833
- Every great story has a twist.

01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:24.125
I'm sorry.

01:25:24.125 --> 01:25:25.625
(suspenseful music)

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:28.167
- Ashley!

01:25:29.458 --> 01:25:31.375
(exclaiming)
(head banging)

01:25:35.958 --> 01:25:37.667
(crying)

01:25:37.667 --> 01:25:39.667
(grunting)

01:25:40.708 --> 01:25:42.542
(breathing heavily)

01:25:53.250 --> 01:25:56.458
- "And as she finally climbed
over the edge, drenched,

01:25:56.458 --> 01:25:59.208
but free from her dark,
dire prison,

01:25:59.208 --> 01:26:01.208
she lifted her eyes
to the sky,

01:26:01.208 --> 01:26:03.667
empowered by the triumphant
realization.

01:26:03.667 --> 01:26:07.000
His submergence
was her emergence."

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:08.833
(applause)

01:26:10.625 --> 01:26:13.542
- Ashley, I'm going to bring
this amazing reading to a close

01:26:13.542 --> 01:26:16.875
with a question
that I think everyone
in this room is wondering.

01:26:16.875 --> 01:26:20.500
You've topped the fiction
charts for months. What's next?

01:26:22.750 --> 01:26:25.708
- I think I may dip my toes
into the waters of true crime

01:26:25.708 --> 01:26:27.375
this next time around.

01:26:27.375 --> 01:26:29.417
- Ladies and gentlemen,
Ashley Dunn.

01:26:29.417 --> 01:26:31.792
(applause)
- Go, Ashley! Woo!

01:26:31.792 --> 01:26:33.833
(cheering)
