WEBVTT

00:10.010 --> 00:12.095
LOS ANGELES, MONDAY

00:15.724 --> 00:17.518
- Okay, Shawn,

00:17.601 --> 00:20.604
so the problem
with making a bit more this year

00:20.687 --> 00:22.189
is now the government
wants you to pay a bit more.

00:22.272 --> 00:26.109
- Yeah, well, I didn't make
Top Salesman last quarter

00:26.193 --> 00:28.195
just to turn around
and give it all back to Uncle Sam.

00:28.278 --> 00:29.988
- Well, I know it's not ideal,

00:30.072 --> 00:32.783
but the dealership covers
all of the overhead,

00:32.866 --> 00:34.618
so you really don't
have any expenses.

00:34.701 --> 00:36.745
- I sold two Isuzu Troopers last month.

00:36.828 --> 00:38.747
Do you know how hard it is
to sell that car?

00:38.830 --> 00:42.042
- Yep. And I am sorry,
but I don't make the rules.

00:42.125 --> 00:45.003
- Uh, where's the write-off
for my car stereo system?

00:45.087 --> 00:47.339
- Unfortunately,
it's not a valid deduction.

00:47.422 --> 00:49.716
- When people see me
pull up to a red light,

00:49.800 --> 00:52.678
I'm blasting Prince
out of my blower points,

00:52.761 --> 00:54.179
people look at me, and they say

00:54.263 --> 00:56.723
"Where the hell did that guy
get that kick-ass ride?"

00:56.807 --> 01:00.769
I tell them,
"Van Nuys Pre-owned Car Castle."

01:00.853 --> 01:02.604
It's advertising.

01:02.688 --> 01:05.607
- Right.
But some might say it's tax fraud.

01:05.691 --> 01:07.401
I don’t want you
to get in trouble here, so...

01:07.484 --> 01:09.486
- Oh, Michael--
Do you mind if I call you Michael?

01:09.570 --> 01:11.405
- Actually, full name is Michelangelo.

01:11.488 --> 01:14.867
- Like the Ninja Turtle?
- Or the Renaissance Master.

01:14.950 --> 01:19.496
- Okay, Mikey, look,
that's a $5,000 stereo system.

01:19.580 --> 01:22.124
We write it off, I save $2,000 in taxes.

01:22.207 --> 01:24.585
Nobody's going to prison for 2 grand.

01:24.668 --> 01:27.421
- Respectfully, no one ever thinks
they'll wind up in prison

01:27.504 --> 01:29.214
until they wind up in prison.

01:29.298 --> 01:31.300
- Oh, yeah? And how are you
such an expert?

01:31.383 --> 01:33.135
- I wound up in prison.

01:35.512 --> 01:37.139
- Here. You can sign here.

01:37.222 --> 01:38.557
- Oh, shit.

01:38.640 --> 01:40.142
You're the Mike Ferro.

01:41.476 --> 01:43.604
The one from the news
a few years ago.

01:43.687 --> 01:45.397
The Mike Ferro that did--
- Hey, guys. Hi.

01:45.480 --> 01:47.274
Why don't I just take over now?

01:47.357 --> 01:50.485
- You got a criminal
handling my finances?

01:50.569 --> 01:52.279
- Mike, why don't you just go
to the break room,

01:52.362 --> 01:53.739
get a cup of coffee, okay?

01:53.822 --> 01:55.532
- Sure.
- Thank you.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.117
Got this.
- Are you serious?

01:57.201 --> 01:59.328
- No, no, no, no. Let me look.
- I've been coming in here 15 years,

01:59.411 --> 02:01.872
and you're hooking me up
with this guy?

02:01.955 --> 02:06.001
- So, Mike, that was unbelievably dumb.

02:06.084 --> 02:09.505
I can't have you out there. I'm sorry.
- I need this job, Gary.

02:09.588 --> 02:14.801
- People need to trust this company,
and people do not trust ex-cons.

02:14.885 --> 02:18.180
I'm sorry. I am.

02:21.558 --> 02:22.601
- Okay.

02:24.311 --> 02:26.438
You're out of sweetener.

02:32.903 --> 02:34.196
THE FUGITIVE

02:34.279 --> 02:36.240
- You needed to keep that job, Mike.

02:36.323 --> 02:37.574
You know the rules.

02:37.658 --> 02:40.118
You don't stay gainfully employed,
the state will punch--

02:40.202 --> 02:42.287
- The state will punch my ticket.
- And back inside you go.

02:42.371 --> 02:43.664
The mayor hates your ass.

02:43.747 --> 02:45.916
You so much as jaywalk,
he'll come at you.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.043
- It's bad enough doing time
for something you didn't do,

02:48.126 --> 02:51.255
but I'm finally out now
and I'm still paying for it?

02:51.338 --> 02:53.799
- Should have waited a few days
to tell me about work.

02:53.882 --> 02:57.094
Now I got to file a Change of Employment
Status with the DOC.

02:57.177 --> 02:59.471
Clock start running
for you to find a new gig.

02:59.555 --> 03:02.975
And not to pile on,
I got a call from the Kellers.

03:03.058 --> 03:04.184
You missed a payment.

03:04.268 --> 03:07.521
- Kevin, money's been tight.
I'm mailing a check out tomorrow.

03:07.604 --> 03:09.481
- Mike, if you don't pay that family,
the state--

03:09.565 --> 03:10.941
- The state will punch my ticket.

03:11.024 --> 03:15.237
Trust me, I'm never doing anything
that'll make me go back to prison again.

03:23.912 --> 03:25.247
- It's for you.

03:25.330 --> 03:29.585
- I don't think my parole officer's
supposed to be giving me a weapon.

03:30.669 --> 03:33.380
- When my old man was in Desert Storm,

03:33.463 --> 03:37.509
he opened the telegram telling him
he's going home with this pocket knife

03:37.593 --> 03:39.469
after a six-month stop-loss.

03:40.554 --> 03:43.974
Eight years ago,
when I had six months sober,

03:44.057 --> 03:46.101
my dad gave me this knife.

03:46.185 --> 03:49.438
Said if you can make it
through six months of something,

03:49.521 --> 03:50.939
you're home free.

03:55.861 --> 03:57.196
You don't even know, do you?

03:58.655 --> 04:00.365
- Guess not.

04:00.449 --> 04:04.203
- Today is six months to the day
you've been out of prison, my man.

04:05.662 --> 04:07.748
Six months into a new lease on life.

04:07.831 --> 04:10.375
I'm passing you the torch.

04:10.459 --> 04:13.170
- No, I--Hey, I can't take this.

04:13.253 --> 04:16.715
You know, I've been doing this 10 years,

04:16.798 --> 04:18.884
working with bad men.

04:18.967 --> 04:20.135
Want to know what I learned?

04:20.219 --> 04:23.180
Michelangelo Ferro is not one of them.

04:25.641 --> 04:27.518
- Shit.

04:27.601 --> 04:28.977
You know you're at rock bottom

04:29.061 --> 04:31.647
when your parole officer's
your best friend.

04:31.730 --> 04:33.607
- Come on, man.

04:33.690 --> 04:34.816
- You've had me in your home.

04:34.900 --> 04:36.610
You treat me like a person
instead of an ex-con.

04:36.693 --> 04:37.945
It's not nothing.

04:38.028 --> 04:42.241
- Good. So when you're
a rich rainmaker again,

04:42.324 --> 04:44.034
you can have me out to Malibu.

04:45.786 --> 04:47.412
Now I'm heading downtown
in the morning

04:47.496 --> 04:49.957
to surprise piss test a stockbroker.

04:50.040 --> 04:53.001
Ride with me. Knock on some doors
of your old haunts.

04:53.085 --> 04:54.378
See who's hiring.

04:54.461 --> 04:56.505
- I'm toxic. Nobody's gonna bring me on.

04:56.588 --> 04:58.090
- You need a J-O-B, bitch.

04:58.173 --> 05:01.093
But for right now you need
to take your mind off things.

05:01.176 --> 05:04.263
Go home. Relax.

05:04.346 --> 05:06.890
Put another baby in Allison.

05:06.974 --> 05:08.559
Tomorrow's a new day.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.412
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:28.495 --> 05:31.081
- I picked up the nail polish remover.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.833
I'm gonna get that ring
out of the bathtub tonight

05:32.916 --> 05:34.585
if it kills me.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.378
How was work?

05:36.461 --> 05:39.590
- Good. Great.

05:39.673 --> 05:42.426
Are you almost ready to go?

05:42.509 --> 05:43.886
- Yeah.

05:43.969 --> 05:46.972
Just want to finish
a few things while I was here.

05:47.055 --> 05:48.682
Car picks me up early in the morning.

05:48.765 --> 05:50.517
- I wish you didn't have to go.

05:50.601 --> 05:52.769
- Well, it's kind of a big deal, you know?

05:52.853 --> 05:55.105
Them flying an assistant to Chicago.

05:55.189 --> 05:59.109
All these execs and just little old me
helping out with the presentation.

05:59.193 --> 06:01.278
- I am so proud of you.

06:01.361 --> 06:05.407
I just don't know how it's gonna be,
just me and Pearl.

06:06.700 --> 06:09.036
- Yeah. She went to sleep early again.

06:09.119 --> 06:12.164
- She used to wait up
for me to get home.

06:12.247 --> 06:16.251
- I know, but the therapist said
there's gonna be an adjustment period.

06:16.335 --> 06:17.753
- For how long?

06:17.836 --> 06:21.340
- Mike, you were in jail for three years,
all right?

06:21.423 --> 06:24.843
- She was 6 years old.
Just give it some time, all right?

06:24.927 --> 06:26.386
I promise.

06:26.470 --> 06:28.555
She'll come around, okay?

06:30.349 --> 06:32.726
Speaking of promises,

06:32.809 --> 06:35.938
someone did promise me
a goodbye I'd never forget.

06:36.021 --> 06:38.857
- Oh, you want the Carlos Bravo,
the famous bullfighter.

06:38.941 --> 06:41.151
- Sí, señor.

06:41.235 --> 06:42.819
- You know, me and Kevin...

06:43.820 --> 06:45.614
We are not thinking about Kevin
right now.

06:45.697 --> 06:47.699
- Or the team or baseball.

06:47.783 --> 06:51.161
LOS ANGELES, TUESDAY
- Hurry up. Got to get to class.

06:51.245 --> 06:54.414
- I thought we could go to the movies
while Mom's gone.

06:54.498 --> 06:57.501
- I don't like going to the movies.

06:57.584 --> 07:00.087
- Really?
You loved it when you were little.

07:00.170 --> 07:03.757
Big Hero 6, The Lego Movie.

07:03.841 --> 07:06.927
- All right. Bye.

07:07.010 --> 07:08.011
- Hey.

07:11.807 --> 07:13.141
Give me a hug.

07:13.225 --> 07:16.645
Honey, I remember
when you hugged me back.

07:16.728 --> 07:19.606
- You left us.
- That's not true. I fought.

07:19.690 --> 07:21.859
Honey, lawyers are expensive,

07:21.942 --> 07:25.320
and I had to take a plea so I can
leave you and Mama with something.

07:40.169 --> 07:42.379
I think Pearl knows I got fired.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.756
- Well, you can't get stuff by kids.

07:44.840 --> 07:47.301
- You know I stopped telling her
I love her.

07:47.384 --> 07:48.927
I'm afraid she won't say it back.

07:49.928 --> 07:51.471
- Just needs time.

07:51.555 --> 07:52.931
Look at you.

07:53.015 --> 07:55.225
All dressed up
for your warehouse interview.

07:55.309 --> 07:56.685
- You know what?
I'm not gonna break my hand

07:56.768 --> 07:58.520
pounding on a door
that's closed to me.

07:58.604 --> 07:59.688
My father was a laborer.

07:59.771 --> 08:01.523
It was good enough for him,
it's good enough for me.

08:01.607 --> 08:02.774
- Well, good luck, money.

08:02.858 --> 08:05.152
- I don't need it.
Got my lucky pocket knife.

08:05.235 --> 08:06.778
- Things will get better, Mikey.

08:06.862 --> 08:09.031
- I'll call you.

08:09.114 --> 08:12.367
- Please stand clear.
The doors are closing.

08:12.451 --> 08:16.163
The next stop
is Pershing Square Station...
