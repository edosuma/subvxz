01:37.698 --> 01:39.133
Gitty!

01:39.233 --> 01:41.269
Gitty! Come over here.

01:48.176 --> 01:50.278
Hi, Dad.

01:50.378 --> 01:51.912
Gertrude Marie Jaeger,

01:52.012 --> 01:53.852
you know I told you never
to play by that silo.

01:53.947 --> 01:56.850
Sorry, Dad. Come here.

01:56.950 --> 01:58.919
Come on.

02:29.550 --> 02:30.984
Just 50 short years ago, there were

02:31.084 --> 02:32.853
seven million small farms
in this country.

02:32.953 --> 02:35.523
Today, in 1982, there are
less than two million..

02:35.623 --> 02:37.183
You know, Gitty, they buy and sell farms

02:37.225 --> 02:38.258
like they're trading baseball cards.

02:38.259 --> 02:39.960
They have no respect for what we do,

02:40.060 --> 02:42.196
no respect for what we built.

02:42.296 --> 02:44.063
We work our tails off and
this is where we're from

02:44.064 --> 02:45.766
and this is where we're staying.

02:45.866 --> 02:48.147
You remember that, Gitty.
This is the best place on Earth.

02:48.236 --> 02:51.171
- You know that, right?
- Yeah.

02:51.272 --> 02:54.575
No, Dad, stop! Stop, Dad, stop!

02:57.044 --> 02:59.847
- You okay?
- Yeah.

03:14.862 --> 03:17.531
Can't we just let it go?

03:17.631 --> 03:20.834
What do you want me to do, Gitty?

03:20.934 --> 03:23.203
The coyotes come down here
and eat her alive.

03:28.509 --> 03:31.412
Wait, wait, hold on, Gitty..

03:31.512 --> 03:32.713
It's just a yearling.

03:32.813 --> 03:35.783
Go to the car and get a blanket.

04:09.917 --> 04:12.185
You're okay, buddy.

04:12.286 --> 04:13.687
You're okay.

04:15.155 --> 04:17.825
Come on.

04:22.796 --> 04:25.232
Hey, Dad shoot a deer?

04:25.333 --> 04:27.401
He hit her on accident.

04:28.736 --> 04:31.138
Hey, Gitty, come over here.

04:37.277 --> 04:40.581
Put your hand down on that.

04:40.681 --> 04:43.551
Come on, what are you afraid of, huh?

04:43.651 --> 04:45.018
Nothing.

04:46.587 --> 04:48.589
Trust me.

04:53.961 --> 04:57.197
Okay, it's a game.

04:57.297 --> 04:59.600
You can't move your hand.
No matter what.

05:02.470 --> 05:04.037
Don't close your eyes.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.273
No, look at me.

05:11.612 --> 05:14.982
See, I knew you'd move your hand.

05:15.082 --> 05:17.050
Mom was looking for you.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.029
- Hi, Mom.
- Hey, sweet pea.

05:29.129 --> 05:30.964
Hey, ah..

05:31.064 --> 05:34.368
Don't even think about
tracking that mud in here.

05:41.709 --> 05:43.243
One, two..

05:44.512 --> 05:48.148
- The short stop..
- Yes! Yes.

05:48.248 --> 05:50.784
Gitty, can you just turn it down?

05:55.723 --> 05:58.526
The baby'll be here by then.

05:58.626 --> 05:59.793
Yeah, I know.

05:59.893 --> 06:01.495
Yeah, I... I know.

06:01.595 --> 06:04.832
Neither can government
and that means taxpayers..

06:04.932 --> 06:06.466
...bail out every farmer
hopelessly in debt..

06:06.467 --> 06:09.403
No. That's a bunch
of bullshit, right there.

06:09.503 --> 06:11.705
That.. I'm sorry, kids,
but that is some bullshit.

06:11.805 --> 06:14.174
- Dad!
- Well..

06:14.274 --> 06:15.443
Mmm.

06:15.543 --> 06:18.245
Honey, will you grab me
another beer, please?

06:23.584 --> 06:26.353
- Stop it, you'll hurt her!
- Gitty, it's a chicken.

06:26.454 --> 06:27.521
Okay? We eat those things.

06:27.621 --> 06:30.458
Well, she's
a very special chicken, Martin.

06:30.558 --> 06:32.092
- Okay..
- Hey, enough!

06:32.192 --> 06:34.528
Are we going to the fair on Friday?

06:34.628 --> 06:36.797
- We have the funeral.
- It's on Saturday.

06:36.897 --> 06:38.465
It's the third one this year,
you know that?

06:38.466 --> 06:39.600
Who died?

06:39.700 --> 06:41.702
Hansen hanged himself in his cow barn.

06:41.802 --> 06:44.004
Hush. That's enough, Martin.

06:45.939 --> 06:47.307
What? Guys, everybody knows.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.009
Why did he kill himself?

06:49.109 --> 06:50.878
Well, you know, I heard

06:50.978 --> 06:52.379
they were taking his farm away.

06:52.480 --> 06:53.481
What?

06:53.581 --> 06:55.182
Yeah, I know his wife got

06:55.282 --> 06:57.250
a hell of a lot of insurance money.

06:57.350 --> 06:59.419
- Right, Mom?
- That's enough, Martin.

06:59.520 --> 07:02.122
- Are we gonna lose our farm, Dad?
- No.

07:02.222 --> 07:03.891
No, sweetie.

07:03.991 --> 07:05.225
- Maybe.
- What?

07:05.325 --> 07:08.061
No, absolutely not,
we're not gonna lose our farm.

07:08.161 --> 07:11.031
Why is everybody so afraid
of telling the truth?

07:11.131 --> 07:12.966
Because your sister
is 11 years old, Martin.

07:13.066 --> 07:14.501
That's why we don't need
to talk about that.

07:14.502 --> 07:16.203
- Okay, so what?
- Martin!

07:16.303 --> 07:18.271
Clear your plate and go upstairs.

07:28.015 --> 07:30.083
Sweetie, do you want to see
if you've got a friend

07:30.183 --> 07:32.152
that wants to come to the fair with us?

07:32.252 --> 07:34.254
No, Gitty doesn't have any friends!

07:34.354 --> 07:36.089
Gitty's only friend
is the stupid chicken!

07:36.189 --> 07:38.149
- She's not stupid, Martin!
- Yeah, she is stupid!

07:38.158 --> 07:38.708
No, she's not.

07:38.709 --> 07:40.359
That's your only friend.
That's why she talks to herself.

07:40.360 --> 07:42.830
You can't be serious.
Stupid chicken.

07:46.366 --> 07:48.135
Maybe Heidi and Michael
wanna come with us?

07:48.235 --> 07:50.337
- Heidi and Michael?
- Mm-hmm.

07:52.105 --> 07:53.741
Heidi and Michael aren't my friends.

07:53.841 --> 07:56.577
They just live next door.

07:56.677 --> 07:58.045
Well, I'll be your friend.

07:59.847 --> 08:01.248
I'll go to the fair with you.

08:01.348 --> 08:03.150
Do you want to come to the fair with me?

08:03.250 --> 08:05.410
- I'll go to the fair with you, Dad.
- Well, thank you.

08:05.418 --> 08:07.138
I guess you do have some friends.

08:07.220 --> 08:08.688
I guess Martin doesn't know
what he's talking about.

08:08.689 --> 08:10.290
And I have a friend in my lovely wife...

08:10.291 --> 08:10.824
Ow, Abe.

08:10.924 --> 08:12.358
- And I am going to enjoy her.
- Let me go. Come on.

08:12.359 --> 08:15.362
- She is kind of beautiful.
- Abe, stop!

08:15.462 --> 08:17.397
Gross!

08:17.497 --> 08:20.568
So, let's see, if I remember correctly..

08:20.668 --> 08:23.103
...we were squirrels
in the story, right?

08:23.203 --> 08:25.072
I don't want to be a squirrel anymore.

08:25.172 --> 08:28.241
You don't want to be a..
Okay, why not?

08:29.977 --> 08:32.746
Martin said they have
babies up their butts.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.472
Martin said they had babies
up their butts, alright.

08:34.472 --> 08:35.014
Yeah.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.375
Do they have babies up their butts?

08:36.416 --> 08:38.450
I don't think that that's
true but if Martin says so

08:38.451 --> 08:39.491
I'll have to check it out.

08:39.553 --> 08:41.188
Okay.

08:41.288 --> 08:43.256
What kind of story do you want then?

08:45.058 --> 08:47.494
How about...

08:47.595 --> 08:51.632
A really... scary story?

08:51.732 --> 08:53.667
But make sure
it has a happy ending, okay?

08:53.767 --> 08:56.136
- Scary story..
- Happy ending.

08:56.236 --> 08:57.537
Hmm.

08:59.406 --> 09:01.975
Have I ever told you
why we have scarecrows?

09:02.075 --> 09:03.510
- To scare away the birds?
- Yeah.

09:03.611 --> 09:04.977
That they're there to scare away
the birds, that's what we

09:04.978 --> 09:07.380
tell people, but have I ever
told you the real reason?

09:07.480 --> 09:08.849
No.

09:08.949 --> 09:10.851
Alright, and you can't tell anyone this

09:10.951 --> 09:13.386
but the truth is,
when a real farmer dies..

09:13.486 --> 09:15.889
- And I mean a real farmer, old-timer.
- Real farmer?

09:15.989 --> 09:18.149
- Farmer that's been here fo...
- What's a fake farmer?

09:18.191 --> 09:19.351
You know, somebody that comes

09:19.359 --> 09:20.559
from the city and thinks
they know how to farm.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.928
- I'm talking about a real farmer.
- Mm.

09:21.929 --> 09:24.431
- Okay.
- A farmer that grew up here.

09:24.531 --> 09:26.466
Who doesn't know anything
except farming.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.368
- Okay.
- When he dies..

09:28.468 --> 09:31.104
He needs to make sure
that his farm, well..

09:31.204 --> 09:32.724
That somebody's there to look after it.

09:32.740 --> 09:33.807
Okay.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.976
So his spirit, it needs a place to go.

09:36.076 --> 09:37.443
So that's why we have
to build a scarecrow

09:37.444 --> 09:40.213
so his spirit can live there

09:40.313 --> 09:41.548
watch over the farm

09:41.649 --> 09:44.084
watch all the little girls
that run around his farm.

09:45.619 --> 09:47.020
But on windy nights..

09:47.120 --> 09:48.756
- Especially on windy nights..
- Yeah?

09:50.157 --> 09:53.393
Sometimes, well, the spirit
gets a little bit lost.

09:53.493 --> 09:55.027
He can't find the scarecrow,
he doesn't know quite where to

09:55.028 --> 09:57.464
go so, not all the time

09:57.564 --> 09:59.833
but sometimes,
he sneaks into the farmhouse.

10:01.601 --> 10:02.219
Sometimes?

10:02.220 --> 10:04.071
Sometimes he sneaks into the farmhouse.

10:04.171 --> 10:06.974
And sometimes he goes upstairs..

10:07.074 --> 10:09.376
And sometimes, he crawls
under the bed of little girls

10:09.476 --> 10:10.577
that are sleeping.

10:13.346 --> 10:15.548
But when he does that,
he always gives himself away.

10:15.649 --> 10:17.576
And you know how he gives himself away?

10:17.577 --> 10:18.218
How?

10:18.318 --> 10:21.488
Because when everything's
quiet and everybody's sleeping..

10:21.588 --> 10:23.390
Okay..

10:23.490 --> 10:26.927
- And there's not a noise in the house..
- No..

10:27.027 --> 10:30.163
Sometimes that farmer,
that farmer's spirit..

10:31.631 --> 10:32.599
He farts!

10:34.201 --> 10:35.703
Dad!

10:35.803 --> 10:38.038
Dad! Dad!

10:38.138 --> 10:40.307
You're so weird.

10:40.407 --> 10:41.674
Well, I guess that makes two of us.

10:41.675 --> 10:44.411
I'm not weird.
You're the weird one.

10:45.679 --> 10:47.114
You need to go to sleep now, hon.

10:47.214 --> 10:48.281
I know.

10:48.381 --> 10:51.384
- You need to say your prayers.
- I will.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.253
And you need to tell me you love me.

10:53.353 --> 10:55.756
- I love you, Dad.
- I love you too, Gitty.

10:55.856 --> 10:56.924
Goodnight, Dad.

11:10.303 --> 11:12.472
Sorry, little guy.

11:19.579 --> 11:21.414
...I have tried everything.

11:21.514 --> 11:24.317
I cannot refinance,
interest rate's at 16%.

11:24.417 --> 11:25.785
You were the person that talked me into

11:25.786 --> 11:27.019
getting this property
in the first place.

11:27.020 --> 11:29.389
You were the one that said
we cannot lose.

11:29.489 --> 11:31.892
You are telling me that we
have less than we had before?

11:50.010 --> 11:51.979
We're on an adventure!

11:56.416 --> 11:58.718
Wait for me, guys.

12:12.265 --> 12:14.935
Come on, Heidi.

12:25.278 --> 12:27.848
- Wow.
- Look at that!

12:41.294 --> 12:42.729
Wow.

13:41.254 --> 13:43.223
Gitty!

13:50.130 --> 13:53.033
- What?
- Took you long enough.

13:53.133 --> 13:55.435
- Is it safe?
- Who knows?

13:55.535 --> 13:59.239
- Is it haunted?
- Probably.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.241
What do you think's down there?

14:01.909 --> 14:03.743
He'll tell us.

14:05.245 --> 14:06.646
It's safe.

14:08.081 --> 14:09.516
Are you sure?

14:09.616 --> 14:11.919
Yeah, it'll be fine.

14:14.454 --> 14:16.056
Is Teddy okay?

14:16.156 --> 14:17.757
He'll be okay, Heidi.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.027
- How deep is it?
- I don't know, Michael.

14:37.010 --> 14:38.912
"The farm killed me.

14:39.012 --> 14:42.215
JR, 1933."

14:42.315 --> 14:44.751
What do you see?

14:44.851 --> 14:46.519
Someone died down here.

14:46.619 --> 14:49.656
- What? Is there a body?
- No.

14:49.756 --> 14:51.992
It happened a long time ago.

14:52.092 --> 14:53.660
Oh.

15:57.490 --> 15:59.326
No. No, no, no.
No. Wait, wait, wait..

15:59.426 --> 16:01.861
Please. Please don't go. Hi.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.264
What's your name?

16:11.671 --> 16:13.140
Gitty.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.376
It's short for Gertrude.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.478
- It's a beautiful name.
- I hate it.

16:19.579 --> 16:22.315
My name's, um..

16:22.415 --> 16:24.684
...uh, Jonathan,
it's not a very pretty name.

16:25.785 --> 16:28.588
Um, hey, Gitty? Uh..

16:29.822 --> 16:31.791
I'm... I'm trapped down here.

16:31.891 --> 16:33.660
And I haven't

16:33.760 --> 16:36.163
I haven't eaten in... in, uh..

16:36.263 --> 16:38.831
Oh, God, in a few days.

16:38.931 --> 16:41.201
Why are you in our silo?

16:41.301 --> 16:43.870
This is your silo?

16:43.970 --> 16:45.905
Yeah.

16:46.005 --> 16:48.475
- I'll go get my dad.
- No! No, no, no. No. Wait.

16:48.575 --> 16:50.710
Wait, wait, please don't.
Please don't.

16:50.810 --> 16:53.713
No one's supposed to know
that I'm here, okay?

16:53.813 --> 16:55.748
Can you keep a secret?

16:55.848 --> 16:58.585
I'm not supposed to keep
secrets from my dad.

16:58.685 --> 17:00.687
He'd get really mad if I did.

17:00.787 --> 17:02.822
Oh, yeah. No, I... I know.

17:02.922 --> 17:04.624
I know, but you know what?

17:04.723 --> 17:07.160
Um, sometimes if it's a friend

17:07.260 --> 17:08.761
if it... it's someone you can trust

17:08.861 --> 17:11.498
and you can, you can trust me,
then it's okay.

17:11.598 --> 17:13.633
So don't tell anyone

17:13.733 --> 17:16.103
that I'm here. Okay?

17:16.203 --> 17:18.070
I don't know.

17:18.171 --> 17:19.872
Please.

17:19.972 --> 17:22.575
Please, Gitty.
I... You know what?

17:22.675 --> 17:25.744
I can, um, I can give you
anything you want.

17:26.746 --> 17:27.847
Anyth... I can do that.

17:27.946 --> 17:29.749
Anything you want in the whole world.

17:29.849 --> 17:31.218
Well, if there was one thing

17:31.318 --> 17:34.921
that you wanted in the whole
world, wh... what would it be?

17:35.021 --> 17:37.324
- Do you know any good stories?
- A story?

17:37.424 --> 17:40.493
- You want a story?
- Well..

17:40.593 --> 17:42.962
My dad tells really good stories.

17:43.062 --> 17:44.431
Huh..

17:44.531 --> 17:47.400
Do you know the story
of the lion and the mouse?

17:47.500 --> 17:49.536
No.

17:49.636 --> 17:51.037
Oh, it's a very good story.

17:51.138 --> 17:55.108
Okay, there was this lion
and, um, he lived in the jungle

17:55.208 --> 17:57.644
and he was very, very strong
and very powerful.

17:57.744 --> 17:59.712
And one night, he's sleeping

17:59.812 --> 18:01.481
and, um, and a mouse comes out

18:01.581 --> 18:03.183
of his hole and it's very dark...

18:03.283 --> 18:05.418
Gitty, come on!

18:05.518 --> 18:07.920
Come on! You're so slow.

18:08.020 --> 18:09.922
Hey!

18:10.022 --> 18:12.759
Hey, Gitty, come back!

18:12.859 --> 18:16.095
Gitty, please! I, uh..

18:18.030 --> 18:21.634
Oh, God, I can tell it..

18:21.734 --> 18:23.236
...better..

18:46.359 --> 18:49.028
...and so the man lived there
for many years

18:49.128 --> 18:51.764
paying for all the bad things
he had done.

18:51.864 --> 18:53.166
Until one day

18:53.266 --> 18:56.503
a princess came and found out
his secret, and together..

19:01.374 --> 19:03.743
Hello?

19:03.843 --> 19:06.078
Who's there?

19:17.424 --> 19:20.026
What are you doing?

19:20.126 --> 19:23.596
Can I have a Popsicle?
May I please have a Popsicle?

19:25.265 --> 19:27.267
If you eat it at the table.

19:34.040 --> 19:35.842
Why do you do that every day?

19:35.942 --> 19:38.177
The metal pieces
I check at work every day

19:38.278 --> 19:39.746
are these really fine wires

19:39.846 --> 19:43.316
that go under the locks on our cars.

19:43.416 --> 19:45.952
And they're really sharp.
You want to try?

19:47.454 --> 19:50.757
No, thanks. I'm never gonna
work in a factory.

19:50.857 --> 19:52.925
Oh, yeah?

19:53.025 --> 19:54.427
I'm special.

19:56.429 --> 19:58.231
You know, Gitty..

19:58.331 --> 20:01.601
...some people think they are
hot shit on a silver platter

20:01.701 --> 20:04.771
when really, they're just
cold turd on a paper plate.

20:05.972 --> 20:07.707
What does that even mean, Mom?

20:07.807 --> 20:09.008
It means special people

20:09.108 --> 20:11.177
don't have to tell you they're special.

20:13.112 --> 20:14.781
Mum..

20:14.881 --> 20:17.450
...if someone asks you
to keep a secret..

20:18.918 --> 20:20.052
...should you keep it?

20:20.152 --> 20:22.289
Why do they want you to keep a secret?

20:22.389 --> 20:24.524
I don't know.

20:24.624 --> 20:27.260
I think they need a friend.

20:28.328 --> 20:30.330
Do you wanna keep the secret?

20:31.631 --> 20:32.965
Yeah.

20:34.301 --> 20:36.836
You should probably keep it then.

20:36.936 --> 20:38.905
Get over here, let me do your hair.

20:48.848 --> 20:50.983
Hi, Dad.

20:51.083 --> 20:53.252
What are you doing
in my kitchen, mister?

20:53.353 --> 20:55.793
Well, I'm gonna make my grandma's
rhubarb pie for the Hansens.

20:55.888 --> 20:57.990
Mm. You need any help?

20:58.090 --> 21:00.226
No, I got it all up here.

21:00.327 --> 21:02.862
I mean, unless, Gitty, you want to help?

21:02.962 --> 21:04.597
Yeah!

21:08.167 --> 21:09.502
Oh..

21:14.106 --> 21:15.742
Sorry.

21:17.510 --> 21:19.579
Okay, now go out there
and get the butter.

21:19.679 --> 21:21.714
Go on. Should I..

21:23.616 --> 21:27.720
"For I was thirsty, and you
gave me something to drink."

21:27.820 --> 21:31.424
"I was a stranger and
you invited me in."

21:31.524 --> 21:33.560
"I was in prison and you came to me."

21:35.562 --> 21:37.697
"And the King will answer them.."

21:37.797 --> 21:40.633
"Truly, I say to you, as you did it

21:40.733 --> 21:43.470
to one of the least of these my brothers

21:43.570 --> 21:44.871
you did it to me."

21:46.406 --> 21:47.674
"The word of our Lord."

21:47.774 --> 21:49.308
- Thanks be to God.
- Thanks be to God.

21:49.409 --> 21:51.878
In the name of the Father, the Son

21:51.978 --> 21:54.447
and the Holy Spirit, Amen.

22:00.653 --> 22:01.588
- Hi.
- Hi.

22:01.688 --> 22:02.655
I'm Ethel.

22:02.755 --> 22:05.392
- Hank and I just moved into town.
- Hi.

22:05.492 --> 22:06.759
I've been doing the paper route

22:06.859 --> 22:08.695
just to get an idea of the area

22:08.795 --> 22:10.997
so if you see me, just say hello.

22:11.097 --> 22:12.499
- Alright?
- Okay.

22:12.599 --> 22:16.102
Oh, um, and if you see the police car..

22:16.202 --> 22:17.904
It... it's, it's, just don't mind it

22:18.004 --> 22:19.739
because, um, I'm just retired now

22:19.839 --> 22:22.241
but I got to keep the cruiser, so..

22:22.341 --> 22:24.977
Alright. Oh, um.. Uh..

22:25.077 --> 22:28.180
Call me if you need anything.

22:31.083 --> 22:33.285
- Alright?
- Thank you.

22:33.386 --> 22:35.622
- Take care.
- You too.

22:37.256 --> 22:38.691
This is just terrible.

22:38.791 --> 22:41.428
Penny said it was
the third suicide this season.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.683
I'll take it.

23:25.572 --> 23:28.575
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

23:34.514 --> 23:35.848
Here.

23:42.388 --> 23:43.556
- No. No.
- Please take it.

23:43.656 --> 23:45.524
Please, please, please.
Come on, you deserve it.

23:45.525 --> 23:48.027
- Thank you. Thank you.
- You deserve it.

24:09.682 --> 24:11.618
Hey, Dad.

24:11.718 --> 24:14.487
Have you ever heard the story
about the lion and the mouse?

24:14.587 --> 24:17.023
Yeah, the one where the mouse
hears the lion screaming.

24:17.123 --> 24:18.990
He finally comes across
the lion, he's trapped in a net

24:18.991 --> 24:20.426
some hunters got him there?

24:20.527 --> 24:21.336
Yeah.

24:21.337 --> 24:23.763
And the lion begs the mouse
to set him free, right?

24:23.863 --> 24:24.997
And the mouse is terrified

24:25.097 --> 24:26.799
but he chews through the net anyway

24:26.899 --> 24:28.668
lets that lion out.

24:30.336 --> 24:33.606
The lion's grateful... right?

24:35.207 --> 24:38.811
No, the lion turns around
and eats the mouse.

24:38.911 --> 24:41.714
He eats his whole family.

24:41.814 --> 24:45.251
You can never trust people to
change their true nature, Gitty.

24:45.351 --> 24:47.654
A lion is a lion.

24:49.388 --> 24:51.390
It's a dog-eat-dog world.

24:58.531 --> 25:00.533
Whoa!

25:03.369 --> 25:05.838
Dad, look!

25:05.938 --> 25:07.339
Can we get it, please?

25:07.439 --> 25:09.942
Yeah. Go on, hurry up.

25:12.411 --> 25:14.747
Thanks, Dad.

25:17.950 --> 25:19.318
Yes, I win!

25:21.921 --> 25:23.890
Thank you.

25:24.824 --> 25:26.593
Mom, I won. Cotton candy?

25:26.693 --> 25:29.161
I don't think so, Gitty.

25:29.261 --> 25:31.998
But Dad promised I could
have some if I won and I did.

25:32.098 --> 25:33.618
Well, I didn't think she was gonna win.

25:35.301 --> 25:36.736
- Dad, come on.
- Alright.

25:36.836 --> 25:38.270
Please, please, please, I'm hungry.

25:38.370 --> 25:39.450
Okay, the sooner you finish

25:39.538 --> 25:41.608
the sooner you can have
your cotton candy.

26:04.831 --> 26:06.733
Nice shooting.

26:12.104 --> 26:14.907
- Hello.
- Hi, Vera.

26:15.007 --> 26:17.677
It's nice to finally meet you all.

26:17.777 --> 26:19.612
I've heard so much about you.

26:19.712 --> 26:22.248
- I haven't heard anything about you.
- Ah.

26:22.348 --> 26:25.017
We met Vera last year
at the barn raising in Iowa.

26:25.117 --> 26:29.656
Oh. Oh, um, nice to meet you.

26:29.756 --> 26:31.891
Mom? Mom, I've finished.

26:31.991 --> 26:34.160
Yeah, w... why don't you guys
go get some cotton candy?

26:34.260 --> 26:35.928
And we'll meet you all over there.

26:36.028 --> 26:37.596
Come on, Mom, let's go.

26:46.639 --> 26:48.708
Hi, um, one cotton candy, please.

26:48.808 --> 26:50.843
- Purple, please.
- Alright.

26:53.512 --> 26:55.014
- There you go.
- Thank you.

26:55.114 --> 26:57.149
- That'll be two dollars.
- Okay.

26:57.249 --> 26:58.718
Here, Mom.

27:13.565 --> 27:14.866
And what are we gonna do
if I get caught?

27:14.867 --> 27:17.937
What am I gonna do?
Think about that.

27:34.153 --> 27:36.522
She's just a friend, she's just
someone I met a while ago.

27:36.622 --> 27:37.824
She said she could help us out.

27:37.924 --> 27:39.125
Well, is she giving us a loan?

27:39.225 --> 27:40.827
She's not giving us a loan.

27:40.927 --> 27:42.594
- She's paying you?
- She's paying me.

27:42.695 --> 27:45.131
- For what?
- For a job, to hold something, Sarah.

27:45.231 --> 27:46.632
To hold a package for her, okay?

27:46.733 --> 27:49.168
To hold a package?
What is it, drugs?

27:49.268 --> 27:51.169
You don't wanna know.
Sarah, you don't wanna know.

27:51.170 --> 27:52.138
I..

27:53.840 --> 27:56.475
Okay, so, w... why... why us?

27:56.575 --> 27:57.576
Why did she... how did
she even choose you?

27:57.578 --> 27:57.909
Why us?

27:57.910 --> 27:59.712
Why it's because I called her, Sarah.

27:59.812 --> 28:02.013
Because I called her when I couldn't
make the payments last spring.

28:02.014 --> 28:04.851
- That's why it's us.
- You didn't tell me, Abe.

28:04.951 --> 28:06.684
And what am I supposed to tell you
when something like that happens?

28:06.685 --> 28:08.125
You're supposed to tell me the truth!

28:08.187 --> 28:10.088
How am I supposed to tell you
that we're gonna lose the farm?

28:10.089 --> 28:11.529
And everything that we've worked for?

28:11.557 --> 28:13.893
How am I gonna tell you that?

28:15.661 --> 28:19.498
I've gotta go to work.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

29:22.628 --> 29:25.064
You came back.

29:25.164 --> 29:28.935
Yeah, um, I have something for you.

29:29.035 --> 29:31.070
You should probably watch out.

29:31.170 --> 29:33.072
Okay.

29:42.514 --> 29:45.784
Thank you, Gitty.
Thank you for this.

29:51.190 --> 29:54.426
You haven't told anyone
that I'm here, have you?

29:54.526 --> 29:57.429
- No.
- Mmm.

29:57.529 --> 30:00.199
You're not a farmer, are you?

30:04.103 --> 30:05.437
No..

30:07.073 --> 30:10.776
No, I'm... I'm not a farmer.

30:10.877 --> 30:12.912
Then what do you do?

30:13.012 --> 30:16.182
I buy land. Farms mostly.

30:17.249 --> 30:19.751
Did you buy our neighbor's farm?

30:19.852 --> 30:22.021
I don't know, maybe.

30:23.189 --> 30:25.324
He killed himself.

30:25.424 --> 30:27.159
I didn't know that.

30:28.394 --> 30:30.396
I'm sorry to hear that.

30:31.697 --> 30:33.799
Did you try to buy our farm?

30:33.900 --> 30:35.801
Gitty, I might have, but, I... I..

30:35.902 --> 30:40.172
You know, if it wasn't me
it would've been somebody else.

30:40.272 --> 30:42.975
The, uh, these farms
are not doing very well

30:43.075 --> 30:45.912
you know, they're all gonna be
bankrupt in a few years.

30:46.012 --> 30:49.848
A... are you a bad man?
Is that why you're in there?

30:49.949 --> 30:52.418
Gitty, no.
I'm a very good man.

30:52.518 --> 30:54.653
You know what?
I'm... I'm..

30:54.753 --> 30:56.422
I'm an important man.

30:56.522 --> 30:58.589
Important people don't have
to say they're important.

30:58.590 --> 31:01.293
You don't understand, Gitty..

31:01.393 --> 31:02.761
Gitty?

31:02.861 --> 31:05.464
My dad says it's a dog-eat-dog world.

31:05.564 --> 31:06.764
You know what, your dad's right

31:06.765 --> 31:08.734
it is a dog-eat-dog world.

31:10.336 --> 31:12.905
You know what, Gitty,
tell... tell your dad..

31:13.005 --> 31:15.107
You tell him that I could pay him

31:15.207 --> 31:17.176
double of whatever they're paying.

31:19.979 --> 31:22.614
Gitty, listen to me. You're not
listening to me. Gitty?

31:22.714 --> 31:24.750
Tell him that I could help you, okay?

31:24.850 --> 31:27.954
Will you? Will you tell him
I can pay him. I can pay...

31:28.054 --> 31:30.422
Why would you help us now
if you didn't before?

31:30.522 --> 31:32.624
God, Gitty, I..

31:32.724 --> 31:35.527
Your... your, your father,
what's his name?

31:38.097 --> 31:39.198
Abe.

31:39.298 --> 31:42.068
Tell Abe to let me out!

31:42.168 --> 31:43.902
I will pay him.
I will help him.

31:44.003 --> 31:46.939
I promise you, and
I will not call the police.

31:47.039 --> 31:49.508
Okay? Tell him that.

31:49.608 --> 31:51.810
I think you're lying.

31:51.910 --> 31:53.679
I'm not lying!

31:53.779 --> 31:57.383
Gitty, I'm not. You... you go
tell him to let me out!

31:57.483 --> 31:58.917
Now!

32:35.754 --> 32:37.523
Dad!

32:39.625 --> 32:40.826
Dad?

32:43.662 --> 32:46.432
Okay, so how long
is he gonna be like this?

32:46.532 --> 32:49.001
No one knows.
He landed badly.

32:49.101 --> 32:50.936
The fall broke his ankle.

32:51.037 --> 32:53.205
There's a lot of pressure on his spine

32:53.305 --> 32:55.541
which is why he can't move.

32:55.641 --> 32:57.443
Will you be having a nurse come

32:57.543 --> 32:59.845
to wash him and help with the bedpan?

33:01.780 --> 33:04.316
Um, no.
I... I can't right now.

33:04.416 --> 33:06.385
I'll, I'll take care of him.

33:20.366 --> 33:21.767
Why isn't he in your room?

33:21.867 --> 33:25.171
We need room for his special bed.

33:25.271 --> 33:27.639
You wanna go say hi?

33:27.739 --> 33:29.708
Okay.

33:59.205 --> 34:00.272
Hey, Mom?

34:04.510 --> 34:06.378
Are you okay?

34:06.478 --> 34:07.812
Yeah.
What do you want, sweetheart?

34:09.715 --> 34:11.583
Does God really love us?

34:14.553 --> 34:17.188
I don't think he hears me at all.

34:18.724 --> 34:21.427
Look for Him
in unexpected places, Gitty.

34:51.922 --> 34:53.858
After the recent passage
of a bill that would allow

34:53.859 --> 34:55.260
for the construction of what could be

34:55.261 --> 34:57.763
the world's largest open-pit
iron ore mine

34:57.863 --> 34:59.598
in Wisconsin's history
of environmental..

34:59.698 --> 35:01.767
- How does this piece move?
- Put that back.

35:03.469 --> 35:05.371
Searches continue throughout the region

35:05.471 --> 35:07.706
for Jonathan Winters,
the founder of Plymouth Company

35:07.806 --> 35:09.475
a large agriculture conglomerate

35:09.575 --> 35:12.110
that has been buying up
failing farms in the Midwest.

35:12.211 --> 35:15.847
Winters was last seen researching
crop yields in the Madison area.

35:15.947 --> 35:17.383
Today the victim's sister...

35:17.483 --> 35:20.419
- Pieces are missing.
- ...message for the kidnappers.

35:20.519 --> 35:24.190
I'm speaking to the men
who kidnapped Jonathan..

35:25.157 --> 35:27.759
...my brother.

35:27.859 --> 35:30.396
I beg you..

35:30.496 --> 35:31.897
...please don't hurt him.

35:33.432 --> 35:36.168
We'll give you whatever you want.

35:37.669 --> 35:41.907
Please, if you could just
tell him that I love him.

35:42.708 --> 35:45.544
Oh, that rich bitch.

35:45.644 --> 35:48.914
Why? What did she do?

35:49.014 --> 35:50.734
She's a monster, Gitty,
that's what she di..

35:50.782 --> 35:53.419
She's a monster.
They're all monsters. Ask Dad.

35:58.957 --> 36:01.360
You know chess
is what the great generals

36:01.460 --> 36:05.096
used to use to sharpen
their strategic skills for war?

36:09.201 --> 36:10.769
Can you teach me?

36:10.869 --> 36:12.903
It wouldn't even be a game,
I'd beat you every time.

36:12.904 --> 36:14.573
What's the fun in that?

36:14.673 --> 36:16.275
Let's face it, Gitty..

36:17.709 --> 36:19.878
...you're not good at much.

36:30.489 --> 36:33.325
Come on, Happy.
Let's blow this joint.

36:58.750 --> 37:00.151
What's this?

37:00.252 --> 37:01.987
It's a lantern.

37:02.087 --> 37:05.190
You know, for light.

37:05.291 --> 37:07.759
A lantern..

37:07.859 --> 37:09.194
Did you bring matches?

37:09.295 --> 37:12.764
Oh, yeah, I forgot about matches.

37:12.864 --> 37:14.766
I'll bring them later.

37:14.866 --> 37:17.936
- Oh, your sister was on TV today.
- What?

37:18.036 --> 37:20.238
My.. Anna?

37:20.339 --> 37:22.341
She said she loves you.

37:25.577 --> 37:28.280
- I should go.
- No, wait, wait, wait. Wait.

37:28.380 --> 37:29.448
Gitty..

37:29.548 --> 37:32.851
Can you wait... for a little while?

37:35.120 --> 37:37.656
Hey, want to know a riddle?

37:37.756 --> 37:40.225
A riddle? Yeah.

37:40.326 --> 37:43.128
Okay. What is..

37:45.163 --> 37:48.367
I swallow up all that's before me

37:48.467 --> 37:51.102
and all that's after me..

37:53.071 --> 37:54.840
...and everyone who is watching.

37:56.575 --> 37:59.110
What am I?

37:59.210 --> 38:02.047
I don't know. What?

38:02.147 --> 38:03.949
Think about it.

38:04.049 --> 38:05.751
Hey, Jonathan.

38:05.851 --> 38:07.653
Yeah?

38:07.753 --> 38:09.788
You..

38:09.888 --> 38:13.124
You said before that you could
give me anything I wanted?

38:14.192 --> 38:16.395
Yes. Anything.

38:17.696 --> 38:20.566
I want my dad to get better.

38:20.666 --> 38:22.334
What's wrong with your dad?

38:22.434 --> 38:24.670
He had a bad accident.

38:26.037 --> 38:28.006
Can you help him?

38:28.106 --> 38:30.075
Yes, I can.

38:31.710 --> 38:34.846
But can you do something for me first?

38:34.946 --> 38:36.247
What do I have to do?

38:36.348 --> 38:39.017
Can you, um, go home

38:39.117 --> 38:42.754
and you see this door with the lock?

38:42.854 --> 38:45.290
Go home and... and find a key.

38:45.391 --> 38:47.593
Okay?

38:47.693 --> 38:49.327
Okay.

38:49.428 --> 38:51.963
Oh, and, uh.. And, oh, uh..

38:52.063 --> 38:53.965
One more thing, can you... can you, uh

38:54.065 --> 38:55.100
bring me some books?

38:55.200 --> 38:57.636
Some really big, big books.

38:57.736 --> 39:01.873
Okay? The biggest you can find
and as many as you can carry.

39:02.574 --> 39:04.843
- Okay?
- Okay.

39:33.171 --> 39:35.006
Mom?

39:35.106 --> 39:36.341
Mom's at work, stupid.

39:36.442 --> 39:38.777
- Where are you going?
- Out.

39:40.278 --> 39:42.448
- Martin?
- Oh, hey, Vera.

39:42.548 --> 39:43.582
Let's go.

39:45.451 --> 39:48.386
Keys, keys, keys..

40:27.693 --> 40:29.260
Where are your books, Martin?

41:08.600 --> 41:11.670
Hey, Jonathan, I... I brought
magazines and I brought matches

41:11.770 --> 41:13.204
and I brought keys.

41:13.304 --> 41:16.508
Matches, check.
Go try the keys.

41:16.608 --> 41:18.009
What are these?

41:18.109 --> 41:19.444
You said you wanted stuff to read.

41:19.545 --> 41:22.113
Oh, no, no! Gitty, no.

41:22.213 --> 41:25.216
I said books. Books, big books.

41:25.316 --> 41:27.452
Oh, my God.

41:27.553 --> 41:28.787
Where did you get these?

41:28.887 --> 41:30.656
I found them in Martin's room.

41:30.756 --> 41:33.391
We don't have many books in our house.

41:33.491 --> 41:36.795
- Is there a library in town?
- Yeah.

41:36.895 --> 41:39.197
Go to the library
and get me books, please.

41:39.297 --> 41:42.333
Big books,
the biggest you can carry, okay?

41:42.433 --> 41:45.537
- Okay.
- Okay, now go and try the keys, please.

41:50.809 --> 41:52.243
Are they working?

41:52.343 --> 41:54.379
I... I'm trying.

41:57.783 --> 42:00.018
Have you ever loved someone?

42:00.118 --> 42:03.388
Like, kisses and stuff?

42:03.488 --> 42:05.991
What is making you think of that?

42:06.091 --> 42:08.794
All those ladies
in the magazine looked..

42:08.894 --> 42:10.862
They look real funny.

42:13.531 --> 42:15.634
Am I supposed to be like that
when I grow up?

42:17.135 --> 42:18.970
No. No, you're not supposed to..

42:19.070 --> 42:21.873
Don't ever, ever be like that.

42:23.141 --> 42:25.176
I'm sorry, Jonathan.

42:25.276 --> 42:26.645
None of these keys work.

42:26.745 --> 42:28.479
Thank you, Gitty.
Thank you for trying.

42:28.580 --> 42:30.716
Do me a favor now and go to the library.

42:30.816 --> 42:33.151
Please go to the library
and get me books, okay?

42:33.251 --> 42:36.054
Real books. Big books.
As big as you can carry.

42:36.154 --> 42:37.956
- As many as you can carry, okay?
- Okay.

42:38.056 --> 42:39.090
I will.

42:40.325 --> 42:43.428
Should I take the magazines back?

42:43.528 --> 42:45.697
Oh, uh..

42:45.797 --> 42:47.198
No.

42:47.298 --> 42:51.637
You can leave these here.
I'll read the articles.

43:29.975 --> 43:32.644
How far away is London?

43:32.744 --> 43:35.380
Very, very far.

43:38.516 --> 43:42.187
Have you heard of Nancy Drew, dear?

43:48.226 --> 43:49.895
Thank you.

44:34.339 --> 44:36.942
We don't have a choice.

44:37.042 --> 44:39.544
You've clearly given us no choice.

44:41.046 --> 44:42.447
There's no other way, Sarah.

44:42.547 --> 44:44.515
This is the only way it can be done.

44:46.217 --> 44:47.518
I'm glad you called me, Martin.

44:47.618 --> 44:50.655
It's all under control.
These things take time.

44:52.924 --> 44:55.593
You're doing great,
I can't say that enough.

44:55.693 --> 44:57.328
How can we trust you?

44:57.428 --> 44:59.064
I wouldn't put your family in danger.

44:59.164 --> 45:00.732
We're in this together.

45:00.832 --> 45:03.334
You told Abe it was a package.

45:03.434 --> 45:07.105
You're doing great. So now, just
keep people away from that silo.

45:07.873 --> 45:10.308
Okay?

45:10.408 --> 45:12.443
Sarah?

45:12.543 --> 45:16.447
We'll be fine, if you can just do that.

45:17.849 --> 45:19.184
What was that?

45:21.419 --> 45:22.653
I don't know. I'll check.

45:49.815 --> 45:51.416
Is there anything up there?

45:51.516 --> 45:55.186
No, I think it was just a rat.

46:06.031 --> 46:07.698
Martin..

46:14.873 --> 46:16.875
Trust me.

46:18.443 --> 46:21.179
It's better that you don't know.

46:21.279 --> 46:23.915
Just keep doing what you're doing.

46:30.922 --> 46:31.990
Hey..

46:32.090 --> 46:34.492
We're doing the world a favor, right?

46:34.592 --> 46:36.094
Okay? It's us or them.

46:36.194 --> 46:38.629
- So, what... what...
- Like you said..

46:38.729 --> 46:41.132
What happen..
W... what if he dies out there?

46:42.433 --> 46:43.501
He won't.

46:45.070 --> 46:47.372
What happens when he gets out?

46:47.472 --> 46:49.107
He doesn't know where he is

46:49.207 --> 46:51.676
and he doesn't know who you are.

46:53.811 --> 46:55.146
I'm in.

46:57.382 --> 47:00.018
You can call me any time.

47:01.686 --> 47:03.054
Well..

47:04.622 --> 47:06.858
I've got chores to do.

47:19.237 --> 47:21.873
Vera, I can help you.

47:24.842 --> 47:27.745
You're strong, Martin.

47:27.845 --> 47:30.081
You could be a real warrior..

47:31.316 --> 47:32.750
...if you wanted to be.

47:42.693 --> 47:45.296
You remember Vera, Gitty?

47:48.633 --> 47:51.369
I got you a burger, Gitty.

47:51.469 --> 47:53.271
Say thank you.

47:54.839 --> 47:56.174
Thank you.

48:01.312 --> 48:03.714
He was a farmer.

48:05.383 --> 48:07.986
That company paid rebels

48:08.086 --> 48:10.321
to burn down farms..

48:12.057 --> 48:14.692
...and they bought them for pennies.

48:14.792 --> 48:16.294
Hmm.

48:16.394 --> 48:20.098
So what happened to the farmers?

48:20.198 --> 48:21.933
They became soldiers.

48:22.033 --> 48:25.603
I got pregnant with Martin
when I was in high school.

48:25.703 --> 48:30.208
Abe was going to play
professionally, things change.

48:30.308 --> 48:32.610
What am I?

48:32.710 --> 48:35.246
Gitty, what are you doing?

48:39.084 --> 48:40.818
What is this, a chess set?

48:40.918 --> 48:43.454
Hmm..

48:43.554 --> 48:45.790
You want to play?

48:45.890 --> 48:47.658
I don't know how.

48:47.758 --> 48:50.195
I can teach you.

48:50.295 --> 48:52.330
From here?

48:52.430 --> 48:54.565
Well, you have a good point.

48:56.501 --> 48:59.070
Maybe I can come down.

48:59.170 --> 49:00.905
Can you fit through that hole there?

49:02.673 --> 49:03.975
Yeah.

49:06.511 --> 49:08.379
Okay.

49:08.479 --> 49:10.148
Be careful.

49:16.754 --> 49:18.123
Careful.

49:23.428 --> 49:26.197
- Careful.
- I'm trying.

49:28.166 --> 49:29.634
I figured out your riddle.

49:29.734 --> 49:32.137
- You did?
- Yeah.

49:32.237 --> 49:34.772
I swallow up all before me

49:34.872 --> 49:37.142
and all that is behind

49:37.242 --> 49:40.611
and everyone... who is watching.

49:41.879 --> 49:45.050
- What am I?
- You're time.

49:45.150 --> 49:47.785
Very good.

49:47.885 --> 49:50.755
- Did Martin do that?
- Oh..

49:50.855 --> 49:52.490
Yes, he did.

49:53.991 --> 49:55.526
Let's play.

49:56.527 --> 49:58.096
Hmm..

49:58.196 --> 49:59.564
Okay.

50:00.798 --> 50:03.168
Let's just set these up.

50:08.573 --> 50:10.075
- I know a few riddles.
- Yeah?

50:10.175 --> 50:13.878
What do you call a cow with no legs?

50:13.978 --> 50:16.347
Uh, I don't know. What?

50:16.447 --> 50:17.415
Ground beef.

50:19.684 --> 50:21.086
That's pretty good.

50:21.186 --> 50:23.821
We're missing a piece.

50:27.158 --> 50:29.260
- Here.
- What's this?

50:29.360 --> 50:31.329
I found it.

50:32.630 --> 50:37.302
Okay, now, bishop
goes like this, diagonally.

50:37.402 --> 50:39.104
This is your rook.

50:39.204 --> 50:41.339
- Your rook goes up and down.
- Okay.

50:41.439 --> 50:43.674
This is my favorite one,
the horsey, or the knight.

50:43.774 --> 50:46.211
He can jump over people.

50:47.712 --> 50:50.615
Let's see.
We've got some good books here.

50:50.715 --> 50:52.817
Oh, yeah, those are due in two weeks.

50:52.917 --> 50:55.386
Oh, okay, I'll make a note
of that in my calendar.

50:56.754 --> 51:01.292
Yeah, there are some
good stories in this book, too.

51:01.392 --> 51:04.429
Do you know any good stories?

51:08.533 --> 51:11.001
You know what? I do.

51:11.102 --> 51:13.704
Once when I was a little boy,
about your age

51:13.804 --> 51:17.775
my parents sent me away for
the summers to the country.

51:17.875 --> 51:20.077
We'd play out in the fields

51:20.178 --> 51:23.281
and every day there was this plane

51:23.381 --> 51:25.716
that would cruise overhead

51:25.816 --> 51:28.052
same flight path, every day.

51:28.153 --> 51:30.020
It was an old plane very slow

51:30.121 --> 51:34.559
looked like a big,
giant, beautiful dragonfly.

51:34.659 --> 51:36.394
Then one day, the plane crashed..

51:37.795 --> 51:40.965
...just about 100 yards
in the next field.

51:42.900 --> 51:46.036
The boy ran over to the plane

51:46.137 --> 51:47.605
and pulled the pilot out.

51:47.705 --> 51:51.041
And seconds later
the plane burst into flames.

51:52.610 --> 51:55.313
The pilot was very grateful

51:55.413 --> 51:57.114
and said to the boy,

51:57.215 --> 51:59.417
"You can have whatever you want."

51:59.517 --> 52:02.853
"Whatever you desire, it's yours."

52:03.688 --> 52:05.656
What does the boy say?

52:05.756 --> 52:08.025
Well, he thinks about it for a minute

52:08.125 --> 52:11.429
and then he says,
"I want a grave stone."

52:14.165 --> 52:16.601
Why does he say that?

52:16.701 --> 52:20.004
I don't know, why do you think?

52:31.616 --> 52:33.218
Hmm..

52:49.867 --> 52:53.271
- You sleep well?
- Hey, Gitty.

52:53.371 --> 52:55.005
Dad!

52:59.277 --> 53:01.579
Thank you so much, Jonathan.
It's working.

53:01.679 --> 53:03.080
What's that, kiddo?

53:03.180 --> 53:04.982
Oh, nothing, Dad.

53:11.856 --> 53:15.025
Well, what road is that?

53:16.694 --> 53:18.629
Oh!

53:18.729 --> 53:20.765
Oh..

53:20.865 --> 53:23.401
Oh, gosh darn it! Uh..

53:23.501 --> 53:25.903
Hello, my dear.

53:26.003 --> 53:27.672
Can I talk to your mom?

53:27.772 --> 53:29.874
Oh, I'm Ethel. Yeah.

53:29.974 --> 53:31.809
- From church? Yeah.
- Yes, exactly.

53:31.909 --> 53:34.545
- Okay. Um, Mom?
- How are you?

53:34.645 --> 53:35.813
Oh, I'm good.

53:35.913 --> 53:36.881
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

53:36.981 --> 53:38.949
And your dad's doing okay?

53:39.049 --> 53:41.252
- Yeah, he's much better.
- Great.

53:41.352 --> 53:43.321
Oh, something happened to your mailbox.

53:43.421 --> 53:47.091
Oh, hi! I'm glad to see
that you're doing better.

53:47.191 --> 53:49.327
- I'm Ethel.
- Hi, Ethel, I'm... I'm Abe.

53:49.427 --> 53:51.562
- It's nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

53:51.662 --> 53:53.498
Oh, and you look fantastic.

53:53.598 --> 53:56.000
Oh, boy, wouldn't you know it..

53:56.100 --> 53:59.203
I got the old squad car
and there's no treads

53:59.304 --> 54:02.740
on those darn wheels,
but I can pay for it.

54:02.840 --> 54:05.910
You.. You hit..
Oh, you hit the mailbox?

54:06.010 --> 54:08.012
- Oh, yeah, I did.
- Oh.

54:08.112 --> 54:09.413
You know what, it's okay, it's okay.

54:09.414 --> 54:10.981
- We'll take care of it.
- Are you sure?

54:11.081 --> 54:13.284
- Absolutely.
- Yeah, we got it.

54:13.384 --> 54:15.052
Oh, thank you. Oh..

54:15.152 --> 54:17.488
Well, nice house you got here.

54:21.559 --> 54:24.028
Well, uh, gotta go deliver the papers.

54:24.128 --> 54:25.730
Oh..

54:25.830 --> 54:26.897
Your paper.

54:28.899 --> 54:30.668
- Thanks.
- Okay.

54:30.768 --> 54:33.938
And please let me know
if you ever need anything.

54:34.038 --> 54:35.340
- Alright?
- Okay.

54:35.440 --> 54:38.008
Alright. And so sorry about the mailbox.

54:38.108 --> 54:39.777
Oh, it's okay. It's good.

54:39.877 --> 54:41.111
Alright.

54:41.211 --> 54:43.814
Okay, talk to you soon.

54:43.914 --> 54:45.516
Okay.

54:47.518 --> 54:50.521
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, Gitty.

54:59.997 --> 55:02.099
Dad, you want to hear a riddle?

55:02.199 --> 55:04.702
Do I want to hear a riddle?
Yes, I want to hear a riddle.

55:04.802 --> 55:06.337
Definitely.

55:06.437 --> 55:08.138
Okay..

55:08.238 --> 55:12.142
I swallow up what is
before me, what is behind me

55:12.242 --> 55:14.779
as well as anyone who is watching.

55:14.879 --> 55:16.180
What am I?

55:21.386 --> 55:24.221
I don't know, baby. Um..

55:24.321 --> 55:26.424
- Guess, Dad.
- I'm trying, I'm trying.

55:29.159 --> 55:30.294
Uh..

55:30.395 --> 55:32.296
- Guess.
- I swallow up what..

55:32.397 --> 55:33.831
A big fat cow.

55:33.931 --> 55:36.567
- No, Dad.
- No.

55:36.667 --> 55:38.035
- No.
- Not a cow?

55:38.135 --> 55:39.704
Just guess.

55:41.238 --> 55:42.606
I don't know, Gitty, you stumped me.

55:49.380 --> 55:51.048
Dad..

55:51.148 --> 55:53.684
...why don't we ever go places?

55:53.784 --> 55:56.521
What do you mean?

55:56.621 --> 55:58.222
Like..

55:59.323 --> 56:01.926
Like Sydney..

56:02.026 --> 56:04.662
...Auckland, London..

56:04.762 --> 56:06.464
...Timbuktu.

56:08.933 --> 56:10.100
Well..

56:13.170 --> 56:15.840
Who would take care of the cows?

56:18.743 --> 56:21.011
Haven't you ever wanted to go places?

56:21.111 --> 56:24.449
Maybe, but no matter what
anybody tells you, Gitty

56:24.549 --> 56:26.984
this is the best place on Earth,
right here.

56:27.084 --> 56:28.919
This is home.

56:32.557 --> 56:34.224
Okay.

56:38.896 --> 56:41.432
That's the second time
this week you've beaten me.

56:42.967 --> 56:45.603
I know you let me win.

56:48.706 --> 56:51.008
Here.

56:51.108 --> 56:52.977
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

56:57.047 --> 56:58.883
Why aren't you married?

57:00.050 --> 57:01.318
I'm just not.

57:01.418 --> 57:03.521
Why don't you have any kids?

57:03.621 --> 57:05.189
I just don't.

57:06.657 --> 57:09.259
What did you want to be
when you were my age?

57:09.359 --> 57:10.327
Hmm.

57:11.762 --> 57:15.833
When I was your age,
I wanted to be a musician.

57:15.933 --> 57:18.736
I loved to play anything with strings.

57:18.836 --> 57:20.938
Why a musician?

57:21.038 --> 57:23.941
Life without music, is a mistake.

57:25.142 --> 57:26.477
Hmm.

57:27.845 --> 57:29.413
Can you tell me another story?

57:31.749 --> 57:33.717
Why don't you pick a story
from one of these books?

57:33.718 --> 57:36.120
There are
some wonderful stories in there.

57:44.795 --> 57:46.363
"William Butler Yeets."

57:46.463 --> 57:48.766
Yates, is from Ireland.

57:48.866 --> 57:52.503
He's a wonderful poet. Pick one.

57:56.073 --> 57:58.375
"The Second Coming."

57:58.475 --> 58:01.546
"Turning and turning
in the widening gyre..."

58:01.646 --> 58:03.614
It's pronounced "jyre," here.

58:07.818 --> 58:10.354
Let's see.

58:10.454 --> 58:13.924
"Turning and turning
in the widening gyre..."

58:18.428 --> 58:21.065
"The falcon cannot hear the falconer."

58:24.034 --> 58:27.037
"Things fall apart,
the center cannot hold."

58:29.574 --> 58:32.476
"Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world."

58:34.244 --> 58:38.448
"And everywhere, the ceremony
of innocence is drowned."

58:41.251 --> 58:43.754
"The best lack all conviction

58:43.854 --> 58:46.924
while the worst are full
of passionate intensity."

58:48.759 --> 58:51.261
"Surely some revelation is at hand."

58:51.361 --> 58:53.764
"Surely the Second Coming is at hand."

58:56.734 --> 58:58.068
"The Second Coming

58:58.168 --> 59:01.371
hardly are those words out
when a vast image

59:01.471 --> 59:04.041
out of Spritus Mundi troubles my sight."

59:05.542 --> 59:07.778
"The darkness drops again

59:07.878 --> 59:11.982
but now I know that
20 centuries of stony sleep

59:12.082 --> 59:15.720
were vexed to nightmare
by a rocking cradle."

59:15.820 --> 59:19.056
"And what rough beast,
its hour come round at last

59:19.156 --> 59:22.359
slouches towards Bethlehem to be born."

59:42.346 --> 59:43.814
Huh.

59:45.282 --> 59:47.084
What the..

59:47.184 --> 59:48.886
What is that?

01:00:04.068 --> 01:00:06.270
Oh..

01:00:08.839 --> 01:00:10.474
Poop.

01:00:29.559 --> 01:00:31.595
I says to Hank, I says

01:00:31.696 --> 01:00:33.964
"I'm sure they're aware
that there are strangers

01:00:34.064 --> 01:00:35.399
poking around on their property"

01:00:35.499 --> 01:00:36.666
and he tells me that I shouldn't be

01:00:36.667 --> 01:00:37.935
checking it out for myself

01:00:38.035 --> 01:00:40.237
but I didn't wanna be bothering you all.

01:00:40.337 --> 01:00:42.137
You're not bothering us,
but we really haven't

01:00:42.172 --> 01:00:43.940
had too much of a problem
with trespassers around here

01:00:43.941 --> 01:00:45.776
so, thank you.

01:00:45.876 --> 01:00:47.544
Yeah, except you.

01:00:47.644 --> 01:00:49.146
Martin, that's enough.

01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:53.517
Funny, though, um, I thought for sure

01:00:53.617 --> 01:00:55.786
that I heard a voice near the silo.

01:00:55.886 --> 01:00:58.055
And... and that truck outside,
is that yours?

01:00:58.155 --> 01:01:00.224
I've heard voices near the silo.

01:01:00.324 --> 01:01:02.760
There's a man who lives there
and he grants wishes.

01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:05.095
Hey, shut up, shrimp.

01:01:05.195 --> 01:01:06.997
You will have to forgive our daughter

01:01:07.097 --> 01:01:09.066
she obviously has a active imagination.

01:01:10.334 --> 01:01:13.704
- It's true.
- Gitty, shut up.

01:01:15.806 --> 01:01:18.909
Well, um, I'd better get going.

01:01:19.009 --> 01:01:21.211
Yeah, Hank is probably
wondering where I am.

01:01:22.646 --> 01:01:25.082
If you'll excuse me.

01:01:25.182 --> 01:01:27.217
- Well, be careful driving.
- Oh, I will.

01:01:27.317 --> 01:01:30.520
And, uh, you've got, uh,
my number in case of emergency?

01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:32.322
Mm-hmm.
It's right on the fridge.

01:01:32.422 --> 01:01:33.390
Great, great.

01:01:33.490 --> 01:01:35.159
Nice mailbox, by the way.

01:01:35.259 --> 01:01:36.325
Try not to hit it this time.

01:01:38.228 --> 01:01:39.997
Bye.

01:01:56.781 --> 01:01:57.882
Can you play it?

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:04.922
Let's see.

01:02:05.022 --> 01:02:07.657
It's a little old..

01:02:07.758 --> 01:02:09.593
...and the bridge is broken.

01:02:11.661 --> 01:02:13.330
Thank you, though.

01:02:14.464 --> 01:02:16.633
You wanna hold it?

01:02:16.733 --> 01:02:18.302
Put it under your chin.

01:02:20.204 --> 01:02:22.006
There you go, just like that.

01:02:22.106 --> 01:02:23.941
Hand on the neck.

01:02:24.041 --> 01:02:27.611
Take the bow, with your right hand

01:02:27.711 --> 01:02:30.747
and hold your thumb there
and your pinky there

01:02:30.848 --> 01:02:33.350
just nice and light.

01:02:33.450 --> 01:02:35.752
There you go.

01:02:35.853 --> 01:02:37.654
And pretend to play.

01:02:37.754 --> 01:02:40.057
See what music comes into your head.

01:02:48.332 --> 01:02:51.001
Hey, Gitty..

01:02:51.101 --> 01:02:52.236
Mm-hmm?

01:02:52.336 --> 01:02:55.505
If we don't ever see each other again..

01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:56.907
...remember me.

01:02:58.775 --> 01:03:00.477
Okay?

01:03:06.516 --> 01:03:07.985
I will.

01:03:20.030 --> 01:03:22.599
Gitty?
Gitty, are you okay?

01:03:22.699 --> 01:03:24.433
I knew it, you were gonna
free him, weren't you?

01:03:24.434 --> 01:03:27.037
Do you know what would happen, Gitty?

01:03:27.137 --> 01:03:29.072
D... Dad would go to jail
for the rest of his life...

01:03:29.073 --> 01:03:30.740
- He's my friend!
- He's not your friend.

01:03:30.841 --> 01:03:33.677
Okay, you idiot!
He's not one of us.

01:03:33.777 --> 01:03:36.097
He pretends to like you, but
he just wanted you to help him

01:03:36.146 --> 01:03:37.114
you stupid little shit.

01:03:37.214 --> 01:03:38.448
Stop it, Martin!

01:03:38.548 --> 01:03:41.518
You wait till Dad finds out.
He'll kill him.

01:03:41.618 --> 01:03:43.720
No..

01:03:43.820 --> 01:03:45.289
Please don't tell Dad.

01:03:45.389 --> 01:03:47.958
Please don't tell Dad, Martin.

01:03:48.058 --> 01:03:51.428
You gotta swear you're not
gonna go back there.

01:03:51.528 --> 01:03:52.728
You're not gonna go back there

01:03:52.729 --> 01:03:54.363
you're not gonna tell the police
about this

01:03:54.364 --> 01:03:56.566
you're not gonna tell Mom
and Dad I found you out here.

01:03:56.666 --> 01:03:59.769
- Yeah, okay.
- No. No, you swear, Gitty.

01:03:59.870 --> 01:04:01.305
You swear on your chicken's life.

01:04:01.405 --> 01:04:04.708
You swear on your stupid
chicken Happy's life.

01:04:06.343 --> 01:04:08.345
I swear.

01:04:09.779 --> 01:04:11.048
Come.

01:04:53.090 --> 01:04:55.892
What's that smell?

01:04:55.993 --> 01:04:58.795
I used bleach.

01:04:58.895 --> 01:05:01.365
I had to.

01:05:01.465 --> 01:05:03.433
He's disgusting.

01:05:04.801 --> 01:05:06.870
He smells like an animal.

01:05:10.374 --> 01:05:12.709
Is that why you like him so much?

01:05:15.980 --> 01:05:18.482
Do you wanna play?

01:05:18.582 --> 01:05:21.151
Aren't you afraid you're gonna lose?

01:05:34.731 --> 01:05:36.900
Why do you like Vera so much?

01:05:37.001 --> 01:05:39.803
'Cause no one understands me.

01:05:41.305 --> 01:05:43.340
But she does.

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:45.409
What does she understand?

01:05:46.743 --> 01:05:48.878
There's two kinds
of people in this world.

01:05:51.115 --> 01:05:54.451
Warriors, they have to protect
the weak ones

01:05:54.551 --> 01:05:56.987
even from themselves.

01:05:57.087 --> 01:06:00.857
And farmers,
they don't make good warriors.

01:06:03.460 --> 01:06:05.729
Gitty, I am a warrior.

01:06:11.601 --> 01:06:13.470
It's your move, Gitty.

01:06:20.477 --> 01:06:22.579
Checkmate.

01:06:22.679 --> 01:06:24.481
It's called a "Blitzkrieg."

01:06:24.581 --> 01:06:27.717
I could teach you, if I wanted to.

01:07:43.827 --> 01:07:46.530
Gitty! Help me!

01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:48.432
Gitty!

01:07:48.532 --> 01:07:50.700
Where are you? Help me!

01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:52.662
Shh.

01:09:03.139 --> 01:09:05.140
Mom!

01:09:11.415 --> 01:09:13.417
Mom!

01:09:41.144 --> 01:09:42.479
Dad?

01:09:43.712 --> 01:09:45.715
Dad!

01:09:55.359 --> 01:09:57.361
Dad!

01:10:05.669 --> 01:10:07.304
Dad!

01:11:06.430 --> 01:11:08.432
What should I do, Happy?

01:11:17.407 --> 01:11:18.842
What should I do?

01:12:15.932 --> 01:12:17.934
"821-158."

01:12:27.243 --> 01:12:29.446
The storm knocked down
the phone lines last night.

01:12:31.415 --> 01:12:33.116
Who are you calling?

01:12:52.301 --> 01:12:53.269
Jonathan!

01:12:54.871 --> 01:12:56.506
Oh, my gosh.
Jonathan, are you okay?

01:12:56.606 --> 01:12:57.807
- Gitty, hi.
- Oh, my!

01:12:57.907 --> 01:12:59.208
- But...
- No, no, no, no!

01:12:59.308 --> 01:13:01.678
Gitty, did you, did you call the police?

01:13:01.778 --> 01:13:02.812
- Gitty, wh..
- No.

01:13:02.912 --> 01:13:04.347
Do you think I wanna stay here

01:13:04.448 --> 01:13:06.550
and play games with a little child?

01:13:06.650 --> 01:13:08.618
Is that what you think?

01:13:08.718 --> 01:13:11.387
I'm dying. Gitty, I'm dying!

01:13:11.488 --> 01:13:14.458
Now go, call the police!
Go, get me out!

01:13:14.558 --> 01:13:17.326
You're the killer. You hear me?

01:13:17.427 --> 01:13:18.628
You're the killer.

01:13:18.728 --> 01:13:21.598
Now go! Go!

01:13:21.698 --> 01:13:24.701
Go, Gitty! Go!

01:13:55.532 --> 01:13:57.534
- Thanks, Mom.
- Yeah.

01:14:09.278 --> 01:14:11.881
Come on in, it's open.

01:14:17.654 --> 01:14:19.789
- Open it.
- Um..

01:14:27.664 --> 01:14:30.734
- Is that enough?
- Yeah, it'll do.

01:14:32.401 --> 01:14:34.037
He needs to be on the midnight train.

01:14:34.137 --> 01:14:36.940
- That's the deal.
- I understand.

01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:38.708
What is it, Dad?

01:14:38.808 --> 01:14:40.644
You mind your own business, Gitty.

01:14:40.744 --> 01:14:42.278
Martin, thank you.

01:14:48.885 --> 01:14:50.987
You're not gonna to eat?

01:14:51.087 --> 01:14:52.856
I can't stay.

01:14:52.956 --> 01:14:55.091
You're just leaving?

01:14:55.191 --> 01:14:57.260
I have nothing left to do here.

01:14:57.360 --> 01:15:00.096
But you haven't done anything.

01:15:00.196 --> 01:15:03.600
You just make other people do things.

01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:06.002
Shut up, Gitty. Okay?

01:15:06.102 --> 01:15:09.005
Martin, watch your mouth at my table.

01:15:09.105 --> 01:15:12.275
- Where are you going?
- To New York first.

01:15:13.409 --> 01:15:15.812
I'm going to New York one day.

01:15:15.912 --> 01:15:18.815
And to London, Tokyo, Paris.

01:15:20.316 --> 01:15:21.317
What?

01:15:22.619 --> 01:15:25.121
People will write books
go to those places, right?

01:15:34.864 --> 01:15:36.365
Martin's sure gonna miss you, Vera.

01:15:36.465 --> 01:15:39.535
- Shut your face, Gitty!
- Martin, watch your mouth.

01:15:43.139 --> 01:15:46.075
Martin, this chicken's delicious.

01:15:46.175 --> 01:15:48.444
- Where'd you buy it?
- I didn't.

01:15:49.646 --> 01:15:51.080
What?

01:15:55.919 --> 01:15:57.787
I found it..

01:15:57.887 --> 01:15:59.188
...in the silo.

01:16:09.098 --> 01:16:11.668
Come on.
Who doesn't love a happy meal?

01:16:11.768 --> 01:16:13.069
Happy?

01:16:15.338 --> 01:16:17.674
Jesus Christ, Martin.

01:16:17.774 --> 01:16:19.174
What the hell is wrong with you, son?

01:16:19.175 --> 01:16:20.615
Why would you do something like that?

01:16:20.677 --> 01:16:22.637
Because she has been visiting
that man in the silo

01:16:22.646 --> 01:16:23.913
for the past few weeks.

01:16:24.013 --> 01:16:25.513
I told her, "Don't go near,"
and she did.

01:16:25.514 --> 01:16:27.050
She was gonna free him, okay?

01:16:27.150 --> 01:16:29.552
How do you expect to learn
a lesson if it doesn't hurt?

01:16:31.054 --> 01:16:34.190
Gertrude, listen to me.
Hey, come here.

01:16:34.290 --> 01:16:35.625
Listen to me.

01:16:35.725 --> 01:16:37.493
Did you talk to that man in the silo?

01:16:37.593 --> 01:16:41.064
Did you mention your name,
anyone's name?

01:16:41.164 --> 01:16:44.133
Gitty, this is
extremely important. Just think.

01:16:44.233 --> 01:16:45.433
I don't know.
I can't remember.

01:16:45.501 --> 01:16:46.969
- What did you tell him?
- I don't know, Dad.

01:16:46.970 --> 01:16:49.105
Think. Gertrude,
try and remember what you told.

01:16:49.205 --> 01:16:51.039
- Dad, I can't remember.
- What do you mean you can't remember?

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:52.275
I, I don't know, okay?

01:16:52.375 --> 01:16:54.343
- Did you tell him...
- I don't know!

01:16:57.914 --> 01:16:59.348
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

01:16:59.448 --> 01:17:01.450
Did you tell him our names?

01:17:03.519 --> 01:17:05.889
- Yes.
- Shit!

01:17:05.989 --> 01:17:08.357
- Daddy, he's my friend, okay?
- What?

01:17:08.457 --> 01:17:09.792
He said he'd make you better and he did.

01:17:09.793 --> 01:17:10.859
He did you make you better!

01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:13.763
- What?
- Unbelievable.

01:17:13.863 --> 01:17:16.332
Just get out, Gitty.
Get out of here.

01:17:16.432 --> 01:17:17.901
Go!

01:17:25.608 --> 01:17:28.011
There's only one thing left to do.

01:17:43.259 --> 01:17:44.579
It's possible that he wouldn't say

01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:45.695
anything about us.

01:17:45.795 --> 01:17:48.698
- No. No.
- Please, just listen to me.

01:17:48.798 --> 01:17:51.200
There's no other way to do this, Sarah.

01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:53.837
Think about it.
He's not one of us.

01:17:55.004 --> 01:17:57.106
He has no reason to help us.

01:17:57.206 --> 01:17:59.508
When he gets out of there, we're doomed

01:17:59.608 --> 01:18:02.078
and someone has to protect this family.

01:18:02.178 --> 01:18:05.949
Your own daughter is the reason
we have to do this. Remember that.

01:18:06.049 --> 01:18:09.285
No, our daughter had nothing to
do with this, Vera. This was you.

01:18:09.385 --> 01:18:11.454
And if we go to prison,
you go to prison with us.

01:18:11.554 --> 01:18:13.422
He's on your property.

01:18:13.522 --> 01:18:16.726
- Your own son cut off his finger.
- What?

01:18:16.826 --> 01:18:20.129
We had to make it look like a
normal ransom kidnapping. He'd..

01:18:20.229 --> 01:18:21.429
How do you think we got that money?

01:18:23.767 --> 01:18:26.435
Vera, you said that you were with us.

01:18:26.535 --> 01:18:27.937
We need you.

01:18:28.037 --> 01:18:31.074
Look, the situation's changed.

01:18:31.174 --> 01:18:33.810
I'm trying to figure it out, okay?

01:18:33.910 --> 01:18:36.512
Oh, my God, Vera,
I wish we had never met you.

01:18:38.848 --> 01:18:41.150
Abe, we got to go.

01:18:42.952 --> 01:18:44.519
- Get out of my house.
- What are you gonna do?

01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:46.489
- Get out of my house.
- What are you gonna do?

01:18:50.259 --> 01:18:52.261
Vera.

01:18:52.361 --> 01:18:54.964
I'll make sure everything
around here gets done.

01:18:55.064 --> 01:18:56.464
You won't have to worry about anything.

01:18:56.465 --> 01:19:00.236
Thank you, Martin. You really
are a brave young man.

01:19:00.970 --> 01:19:03.006
I wish you all the best.

01:19:35.204 --> 01:19:37.206
Where did you come from?

01:20:00.463 --> 01:20:02.631
I know you think I'm a bad person..

01:20:05.534 --> 01:20:07.370
...but I'm not.

01:20:13.109 --> 01:20:15.044
Then what are you?

01:20:19.815 --> 01:20:23.452
People like that man
you met in the silo..

01:20:26.355 --> 01:20:28.992
...if you let them..

01:20:29.092 --> 01:20:31.327
...they will take everything from you.

01:20:34.964 --> 01:20:37.533
It's not about right or wrong, Gitty.

01:20:39.869 --> 01:20:42.638
It's about who has control..

01:20:43.672 --> 01:20:45.241
...who has the power.

01:20:50.079 --> 01:20:52.148
You have to decide for yourself.

01:21:02.858 --> 01:21:06.162
821-158.

01:21:06.262 --> 01:21:08.097
821-158.

01:21:08.197 --> 01:21:09.432
821-1..

01:21:09.532 --> 01:21:10.967
Okay.

01:21:12.535 --> 01:21:16.039
Hi, Ethel, it's Gitty.
I need your help now.

01:21:16.139 --> 01:21:18.407
At the silo, can you get there now?

01:21:19.508 --> 01:21:21.744
When, when can you get there?

01:21:21.844 --> 01:21:23.812
Okay, will you please hurry, okay?

01:21:25.014 --> 01:21:27.183
Hey, Jonathan, watch out!

01:21:30.886 --> 01:21:32.888
I... I'm coming down!

01:21:43.967 --> 01:21:46.069
Come on, Jonathan. We have
to go. We have to hurry!

01:21:46.169 --> 01:21:48.137
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!
- Hi.

01:21:48.237 --> 01:21:49.572
- Let's go.
- I'm so sorry.

01:21:49.672 --> 01:21:52.275
- I know. I know.
- I'm so sorry. I..

01:21:52.375 --> 01:21:54.477
Are the, are the police coming?

01:21:54.577 --> 01:21:56.777
I don't know, I don't know,
but Martin, Martin is coming

01:21:56.779 --> 01:21:59.715
and we need to hurry, okay?
We need to go now.

01:21:59.815 --> 01:22:02.018
Now, get the axe.
Get the axe. Come on!

01:22:02.118 --> 01:22:04.253
Come on, hit the door!

01:22:16.532 --> 01:22:19.002
You can, you can,
you can do it! You have to!

01:22:19.102 --> 01:22:21.971
You have to do it.
We have no other choice!

01:22:22.871 --> 01:22:24.240
Jonathan, let me try.

01:22:24.340 --> 01:22:25.975
I can do it. Let me try. Wait.

01:22:37.453 --> 01:22:39.888
Jonathan, what are you doing?

01:22:39.989 --> 01:22:42.158
Jonathan, we have to try!

01:22:42.258 --> 01:22:44.327
- We have to try!
- It's no use.

01:22:52.968 --> 01:22:54.503
Stay with me for a second, please.

01:22:57.973 --> 01:23:00.609
I'm sorry.

01:23:00.709 --> 01:23:02.011
I'm sorry.

01:23:04.913 --> 01:23:05.914
Hey..

01:23:10.886 --> 01:23:15.491
You are the bravest person
that I've ever known.

01:23:18.094 --> 01:23:20.629
I'm glad you're my friend.

01:23:20.729 --> 01:23:22.365
I am very glad to have met you.

01:23:22.465 --> 01:23:25.868
You are, you're the best friend
I've ever..

01:23:27.736 --> 01:23:30.206
You're the best friend I've ever had.

01:23:30.306 --> 01:23:32.007
Loving so deeply.

01:23:33.576 --> 01:23:36.112
Your father and his farm..

01:23:37.546 --> 01:23:38.714
Even your chicken.

01:23:39.915 --> 01:23:41.384
Happy.

01:23:43.686 --> 01:23:46.355
This can't be the ending, Jonathan

01:23:46.455 --> 01:23:49.325
not that I, I want a happy ending.

01:23:55.564 --> 01:23:57.066
- Okay?
- Yeah.

01:24:13.482 --> 01:24:15.584
- What was that?
- I don't know.

01:24:19.688 --> 01:24:20.789
Gitty?

01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:23.726
Gitty!

01:24:25.594 --> 01:24:27.730
Ethel, we're inside!

01:24:27.830 --> 01:24:29.632
Gitty, what are you doing up there?

01:24:29.732 --> 01:24:32.335
Get down from there,
that's dangerous! Honey.

01:24:35.404 --> 01:24:36.705
Oh, God.

01:24:36.805 --> 01:24:39.208
Thank, God, Gitty.

01:24:49.818 --> 01:24:52.821
Honey, what are doing?
You got to get down from there.

01:24:54.490 --> 01:24:57.293
- Aw!
- Ethel, run!

01:24:57.393 --> 01:24:59.428
- Run!
- Gitty, what's happening?

01:25:02.865 --> 01:25:05.067
Gitty!

01:25:05.168 --> 01:25:08.070
Come on. Come on. Shit!

01:25:14.577 --> 01:25:16.312
Martin, no!

01:25:31.059 --> 01:25:33.061
This is your fault, Gitty!

01:25:34.597 --> 01:25:36.699
She's here because of you!

01:26:32.621 --> 01:26:34.290
Gitty.

01:26:34.390 --> 01:26:36.359
Martin. Hey, it's a girl!

01:26:36.459 --> 01:26:38.561
Martin. Gitty.

01:27:11.994 --> 01:27:14.129
Come out, Gitty.

01:27:14.229 --> 01:27:16.198
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

01:27:17.433 --> 01:27:19.201
I'm gonna kill you

01:27:19.302 --> 01:27:21.570
just like I killed your fuckin' chicken.

01:27:24.106 --> 01:27:26.542
Tasted real good, didn't it?

01:27:26.642 --> 01:27:28.844
I could just tell everyone.

01:27:28.944 --> 01:27:30.913
I'll tell everyone
that he killed you both.

01:27:56.305 --> 01:27:58.140
- Ugh!
- Ah-ah!

01:28:01.944 --> 01:28:03.512
Don't move, Martin.

01:28:05.013 --> 01:28:07.182
Come on, Gitty, you wouldn't
shoot me, would you?

01:28:10.986 --> 01:28:13.756
There's two types of people
in this world

01:28:13.856 --> 01:28:16.325
you gotta choose what kind of
person you're gonna be.

01:28:18.327 --> 01:28:19.462
Ah!

01:29:26.962 --> 01:29:28.096
Stop!

01:29:29.432 --> 01:29:31.500
Stop!

01:29:31.600 --> 01:29:32.568
Stop right there!

01:30:06.635 --> 01:30:07.970
Dad, no!

01:31:06.328 --> 01:31:09.164
It's morning again in America.

01:31:09.264 --> 01:31:12.034
Today more men and women will
go to work than ever before

01:31:12.134 --> 01:31:14.570
in our country's history.

01:31:14.670 --> 01:31:17.540
Nearly 2000 families today
will buy new homes.

01:32:26.675 --> 01:32:28.010
