08:50.548 --> 08:52.099
What's going on with you?
Why are you acting so weird?

08:52.150 --> 08:53.767
I don't know what
you're talking about.

08:53.818 --> 08:54.852
You're not doing your job.

08:54.886 --> 08:56.186
You're laughing at rectum jokes,

08:56.221 --> 08:58.889
you're leaving early.
Did we switch brains?

08:58.907 --> 09:00.791
Why am I not
feeling your boobs?

09:00.825 --> 09:03.794
Baah!
What is happening!?

09:05.096 --> 09:06.730
Jenna.

09:08.616 --> 09:09.750
We need to talk
about <i>Kidz.</i>

09:09.784 --> 09:12.035
Did you see
last night's ratings?

09:12.069 --> 09:14.538
The only show I've ever
been on that got a 10.2

09:14.572 --> 09:15.589
was when Mickey Rourke
threw me onto the field

09:15.623 --> 09:17.073
during the super bowl.

09:17.092 --> 09:18.809
Obviously I'm thrilled
about the show's success,

09:18.843 --> 09:22.045
but I wanted to talk to you
about your...onscreen persona.

09:22.080 --> 09:24.581
I had an idea...
Two words: B.B. Gun.

09:24.599 --> 09:27.050
Actually, I think the mean
thing may have run its course.

09:27.084 --> 09:30.587
What if you went the other way,
and you were nice to the kids?

09:30.622 --> 09:31.939
Well, no.

09:31.973 --> 09:34.825
I mean, being the nice one
is McEnroe’s thing.

09:34.859 --> 09:38.094
Ah, yes, well, we've done
some focus testing, and frankly

09:38.113 --> 09:40.597
I haven't seen such
a unanimously negative response

09:40.615 --> 09:43.300
since the <i>Frasier</i>
<i>spin-off,</i> <i>hey, Roz.</i>

09:43.334 --> 09:45.402
Jenna, they hate you.

09:45.436 --> 09:49.072
No, Jack.
They love to hate me.

09:49.107 --> 09:51.942
<i>Kidz</i> is minting money
for both of us.

09:51.960 --> 09:53.961
And what's more
important than money?

09:53.995 --> 09:55.779
Well, perhaps we could make
even more money

09:55.814 --> 09:56.964
by pretending to be nice.

09:56.998 --> 09:58.482
I mean,
look at Betty White.

09:58.516 --> 10:02.686
End of discussion.
Just ease off on the kids.

10:02.720 --> 10:03.804
Look, according to Tracy,

10:03.838 --> 10:05.472
people are switching minds
around here.

10:05.507 --> 10:07.624
That's obviously
what's happened.

10:07.659 --> 10:11.662
So whoever you are,
show me Jack's penis.

10:12.847 --> 10:14.014
That's for you.

10:17.035 --> 10:19.520

more of these.

I don't know what this is,

10:25.877 --> 10:27.978
but I like it.
Ha, finally.

10:27.996 --> 10:29.997
After 6 years,
I've cheered up miss Lemon.

10:30.031 --> 10:32.115
That was on your list?

10:32.149 --> 10:33.951
I'm not always in a bad mood.
And I happen to be

10:33.985 --> 10:35.619
in a really good
place right now.

10:35.653 --> 10:37.120
Well, enjoy it
while you can,

10:37.154 --> 10:39.990
because tomorrow,
you're going to women's hell.

10:40.024 --> 10:42.843
Uh, also, FYI,
women's hell is the same as

10:42.877 --> 10:45.062
aroused dog heaven.
Kenneth.

10:45.096 --> 10:48.665
Why are you still here?
This is your last day on Earth.

10:48.700 --> 10:50.000
There's so much
you haven't done.

10:50.034 --> 10:52.219
Oh, sir,
I've done plenty.

10:52.270 --> 10:54.137
Oh, really?
Have you ever been in love?

10:54.171 --> 10:55.839
Only while
playing tennis.

10:55.874 --> 10:57.558
I'm kidding.
I've never played tennis.

10:57.609 --> 10:59.409
Have you ever been
in an airplane?

10:59.444 --> 11:01.678
Well, does falling off
a bridge in a horse cart count?

11:01.713 --> 11:04.414
Have you ever stood on a beach
and watched the sun rise?

11:04.449 --> 11:06.116
Sir, I've never
even seen the ocean.

11:06.150 --> 11:07.951
Never?
Kenneth, that's insane.

11:07.986 --> 11:11.922
We were all put on this crazy
blue marble for a reason...

11:11.956 --> 11:14.758
- To love, and live.
- What is going on with you?

11:14.792 --> 11:17.127
Everyone's talking about
how weird you're acting.

11:17.161 --> 11:18.579
- What are you on?
- You know what?

11:18.630 --> 11:20.831
I have seen the ocean
on a can of tuna.

11:20.865 --> 11:23.250
Newsflash, Kenneth!
Everybody get down!

11:23.301 --> 11:25.302
It's not going to happen.
The world's not ending.

11:25.336 --> 11:28.171
Oh, the rapture
is happening, sir.

11:28.206 --> 11:30.140

said he saw the snakes

11:30.174 --> 11:32.142

with the mice.

You're like a child.
He's messing with you.

11:52.997 --> 11:55.616
Do you think Liz Lemon
has been acting weird lately?

11:55.667 --> 11:57.000
She's hiding
something from us.

11:57.035 --> 11:58.619
Like what?
A present? For me?

11:58.670 --> 12:00.270
Can I return it
for cash?

12:00.305 --> 12:01.338
No, this is
bigger than that.

12:01.372 --> 12:03.173
Something like
a sex-change operation

12:03.207 --> 12:07.010
or a secret pregnancy
or a radioactive spider bite.

12:07.045 --> 12:09.012
I've got to get
her focus back on me,

12:09.047 --> 12:11.014
or who knows the dumb stuff
I'm going to start doing?

12:11.049 --> 12:14.101
Is that why you're
not wearing pants right now?

12:14.135 --> 12:16.853
Yes! I'm actually
glad this happened.

12:16.888 --> 12:18.121
You're proving my point.

Look, if you think
something's going on with Liz,

just follow her.

Then how come
I found this in her trash?

18:11.074 --> 18:13.526
Oh, Tracy,
this is dexoprex.

18:13.560 --> 18:15.595
My mother takes it
for joint pain.

18:15.629 --> 18:19.065
Her wrist was starting to bother
her from slapping busboys.

18:19.099 --> 18:20.533
So it's not
the Bandito Blanco?

18:20.567 --> 18:22.668
A name for cocaine
I just made up?

18:22.703 --> 18:24.670
I know Liz Lemon
better than she knows herself.

18:24.705 --> 18:26.672
Why would she need
joint pain medication?

18:26.707 --> 18:29.776
And why would she be
meeting people down by...

18:29.810 --> 18:31.577
Tracy.

18:31.612 --> 18:34.413
What building is right
next to Penn Station?

18:34.448 --> 18:37.016
The Manhattan center
for penis enlargement?

18:37.050 --> 18:38.768
I know because
my friend goes there.

18:38.802 --> 18:40.219
His name is Tracy.

18:40.254 --> 18:43.322

18:46.092 --> 18:47.460
Did you know that
Lemon attended college

18:47.494 --> 18:50.630
on a partial
jazz dance scholarship?

18:50.664 --> 18:51.998
And do you know
what event was held

18:52.032 --> 18:54.066
last night at
Madison Square Garden?

18:54.101 --> 18:56.903
A crack whore
convention?

18:56.937 --> 18:58.070
No. Worse.

you wouldn't contribute
