00:15.820 --> 00:19.760
One last thought before
the bright halls of high school

00:19.760 --> 00:21.590
fade into memory--

00:21.590 --> 00:25.100
Good luck, good life.

00:25.100 --> 00:28.100
I wish you all
the health, prosperity...

00:28.100 --> 00:30.100
We want money!

00:30.100 --> 00:32.040
and happiness you desire.

00:32.040 --> 00:34.040
Congratulations,
class of'87.

00:47.790 --> 00:49.550
Here, that's yours.

00:49.550 --> 00:52.060
See you later.

00:52.060 --> 00:55.390
Thank you.
This is too great.

00:55.390 --> 00:58.400
Consider it
a graduation gift.

00:58.400 --> 01:00.990
The fact is,
I never thought

01:00.990 --> 01:04.000
we'd get this far.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.010
Um, I'm speechless.

01:07.010 --> 01:09.010
That's another surprise!

01:09.010 --> 01:12.010
All right,
I'll be home much later.

01:12.010 --> 01:12.760
OK.

01:13.920 --> 01:15.510
Thanks, man.

01:15.510 --> 01:19.020
Keep on your toes.
Nobody likes a complacent parent.

01:20.720 --> 01:23.020
Hi, Miss Simpson,
how are you?

01:23.020 --> 01:25.030
You have plans
for tonight?

01:25.030 --> 01:27.030
After dinner,
a few parties.

01:27.030 --> 01:29.030
How's your father,
Blair?

01:29.030 --> 01:32.530
He was supposed to be here,
but I guess his plane was delayed.

01:32.530 --> 01:34.030
Graduates.

01:34.030 --> 01:35.540
Mom Easton,

01:35.540 --> 01:37.540
you must be very proud.

01:37.540 --> 01:39.040
Extremely.

01:39.040 --> 01:41.040
Where's
the ex-Mr. Easton?

01:41.040 --> 01:43.040
He's bringing the car around.

01:43.040 --> 01:44.040
Ready?

01:44.040 --> 01:46.050
I'll see you at dinner?

01:46.050 --> 01:48.050
Yeah. Dad coming?

01:48.050 --> 01:51.050
Yes, but don't worry.
Amnesty for a special occasion.

01:51.050 --> 01:53.050
All right, bye.

01:56.620 --> 01:58.390
Hey, congratulations!

02:01.830 --> 02:03.420
Catch this!

02:04.500 --> 02:05.760
Good catch!

02:05.760 --> 02:07.770
Wait a minute!
Hold up!

02:07.770 --> 02:09.770
I have a brief announcement.

02:09.770 --> 02:13.270
I want you to know
that I, Julian Wells,

02:13.270 --> 02:16.170
have just become
a fully-financed record producer.

02:16.170 --> 02:18.680
Where did you
get the dough?

02:18.680 --> 02:21.180
Mr. Benjamin Wells,
the greatest dad in dad history.

02:21.180 --> 02:23.770
Tone Deaf Records
is a reality.

02:23.770 --> 02:26.790
If you quit college,
we could work together.

02:26.790 --> 02:27.790
No.

02:27.790 --> 02:29.790
Why don't you
try college?

02:29.790 --> 02:31.790
I barely survived
high school.

02:31.790 --> 02:34.790
I can't believe
we won't be together.

02:34.790 --> 02:36.800
We have the summer together.

02:36.800 --> 02:39.130
Markie, a photo
for posterity.

02:40.870 --> 02:41.800
Ready?

02:41.800 --> 02:43.000
Yes.

02:43.000 --> 02:45.100
Ha ha ha!
Ready?

02:45.100 --> 02:46.370
Aim...

03:25.210 --> 03:26.340
Hello.

03:26.340 --> 03:29.350
Hi, it's me. It's early, huh?
It's late for me.

03:29.350 --> 03:31.350
Are you coming home
for Christmas?

03:31.350 --> 03:32.350
Yeah.

03:32.350 --> 03:33.350
Great.

03:34.920 --> 03:36.860
Why are you calling?

03:36.860 --> 03:39.020
I'm sorry.
This is stupid.

03:39.020 --> 03:41.530
I just want to
see you.

03:41.530 --> 03:44.030
Call me when you
get back.

03:44.030 --> 03:46.360
I need to
see you, Clay.

04:09.760 --> 04:12.820
<i>What's the matter,
Blair?</i>

04:12.820 --> 04:14.330
<i>Nothing.</i>

04:14.330 --> 04:15.590
<i>Blair.</i>

04:19.269 --> 04:22.330
<i>I'm not going to college.
I'm staying here.</i>

04:24.410 --> 04:25.670
<i>Why?</i>

04:27.410 --> 04:29.340
<i>I can't leave now.</i>

04:29.340 --> 04:32.350
<i>I'm starting to get
all the great jobs.</i>

04:32.350 --> 04:35.350
<i>I worked really hard
for all this.</i>

04:35.350 --> 04:38.750
<i>Modeling? Why don't you try
something more challenging,</i>

04:38.750 --> 04:40.580
<i>like a game show host?</i>

04:40.580 --> 04:42.620
<i>What happened
to our plans--</i>

04:42.620 --> 04:45.180
<i>You and me,
the apartment together?</i>

04:45.180 --> 04:47.280
<i>I can't go.</i>

04:47.280 --> 04:48.690
<i>Clay...</i>

04:50.460 --> 04:52.560
<i>because I don't want to.</i>

04:56.940 --> 04:59.130
<i>Because I'm afraid to, OK?</i>

05:00.940 --> 05:03.070
<i>This is
where I live.</i>

05:03.070 --> 05:06.310
<i>Because I'm afraid, OK?
I am.</i>

05:06.310 --> 05:08.640
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

05:21.060 --> 05:23.500
<i>Take care of Blair
for me.</i>

05:23.500 --> 05:26.500
<i>Forget about her
and go east, young man.</i>

05:26.500 --> 05:29.500
<i>Hot cocoa, girls
with woolen knee socks.</i>

05:29.500 --> 05:30.500
<i>Huh?</i>

05:30.500 --> 05:31.540
<i>Bye.</i>

05:31.540 --> 05:33.770
<i>Don't forget
the high-IQ pussy,</i>

05:33.770 --> 05:36.210
<i>''On leaf he walks, ''</i>

05:36.210 --> 05:38.400
<i>girls in flannel nightgowns,</i>

05:38.400 --> 05:40.540
<i>L.L. Bean.</i>

05:40.540 --> 05:43.950
<i>Take care of Blair
for me.</i>

05:56.430 --> 05:58.020
<i>Happy Thanksgiving,
Julian.</i>

05:58.020 --> 05:59.860
<i>Needed time, Blair?</i>

05:59.860 --> 06:03.630
<i>It didn't take much time
to fuck my best friend.</i>

06:13.610 --> 06:16.520
#Time, time, time #

06:18.920 --> 06:23.380
# See what's become of me #

06:41.280 --> 06:42.830
#Time, time, time #

06:42.830 --> 06:47.350
# See what's become of me #

06:47.350 --> 06:49.710
#While I looked around #

06:49.710 --> 06:53.350
# For my possibilities #

06:53.350 --> 06:56.750
# I was so hard to please #

06:56.750 --> 06:58.160
# Look around #

06:58.160 --> 06:59.850
# Leaves are brown #

06:59.850 --> 07:01.290
#And the sky #

07:01.290 --> 07:05.300
# Is a hazy shade of winter #

07:05.300 --> 07:08.390
# Hear the Salvation Army band #

07:09.870 --> 07:11.300
# Down by the riverside #

07:11.300 --> 07:12.900
# It's bound to be a better ride #

07:12.900 --> 07:15.530
#Than what you got planned #

07:15.530 --> 07:18.980
# Carry a cup in your hand #

07:18.980 --> 07:20.310
# Look around #

07:20.310 --> 07:21.970
# Leaves are brown #

07:21.970 --> 07:23.640
#And the sky #

07:23.640 --> 07:27.810
# Is a hazy shade of winter #

07:27.810 --> 07:30.320
# Hang onto your hopes, my friend #

07:32.290 --> 07:33.660
#That's an easy thing to say #

07:33.660 --> 07:35.460
# But if your hopes will pass away #

07:35.460 --> 07:37.830
# Simply pretend #

07:37.830 --> 07:41.330
#That you can build them again #

07:41.330 --> 07:42.800
# Look around #

07:42.800 --> 07:44.340
# Grass is high #

07:44.340 --> 07:45.840
# Fields are ripe #

07:45.840 --> 07:48.670
# It's the springtime of my life #

07:49.910 --> 07:51.280
#Ahhh #

07:51.280 --> 07:54.470
# Seasons change with the scenery #

07:54.470 --> 07:57.710
#Weaving time in a tapestry #

07:57.710 --> 08:02.950
#Won't you stop and remember me? #

08:09.860 --> 08:11.300
Hello.

08:11.300 --> 08:13.300
Mom. Anybody home?

08:15.800 --> 08:17.770
#Time, time, time #

08:17.770 --> 08:21.670
# See what's become of me #

08:21.670 --> 08:24.040
#While I looked around #

09:32.380 --> 09:35.310
<i>Hi, Clay, it's me.
Are you home yet?</i>

09:35.310 --> 09:37.780
<i>I'll see you
at Alana's party.</i>

09:37.780 --> 09:39.650
<i>Hope so.</i>

09:44.330 --> 09:45.170
#Whoa #

09:53.230 --> 09:54.750
# Come on, boys #

09:56.100 --> 09:57.260
Thanks.

09:57.260 --> 10:00.270
#You show us
everything you've got #

10:00.270 --> 10:03.500
# Keep on dancin',
and the room gets so hot #

10:03.500 --> 10:05.100
#You drive us wild #

10:05.100 --> 10:07.770
#We'll drive you crazy #

10:09.750 --> 10:12.770
#And you say you want to
go for a spin #

10:12.770 --> 10:16.280
#The party's startin',
babe, I'll let you in #

10:16.280 --> 10:17.840
#You drive us wild #

10:17.840 --> 10:20.790
#We'll drive you crazy #

10:20.790 --> 10:22.290
Hey, Trent.

10:22.290 --> 10:24.790
Hey, nice tan.

10:28.530 --> 10:33.630
# I wanna rock and roll
all nite #

10:33.630 --> 10:35.470
#And party every day #

10:35.470 --> 10:37.800
Hi, Clay.

10:37.800 --> 10:39.970
Hey, Eddie.

10:39.970 --> 10:41.810
#And party every day #

10:41.810 --> 10:46.310
# I wanna rock and roll
all nite #

10:46.310 --> 10:48.110
#And party every day #

10:48.110 --> 10:52.810

all nite #

10:52.810 --> 10:54.650
#And party every day... #

10:57.390 --> 10:59.330
When did you
get back?

10:59.330 --> 11:00.330
Yesterday.

11:00.330 --> 11:02.920
How's M.I.T.?

11:02.920 --> 11:05.260
It's weird
and stimulating.

11:05.260 --> 11:09.170
Did you know you have television sets
between your legs?

11:09.170 --> 11:11.500
I'll see you later.

11:11.500 --> 11:13.770
#You show us
everything you g-g-g-got #

11:13.770 --> 11:16.870
# Baby, baby,
that's quite a lot #

11:16.870 --> 11:18.500
#You drive us wild #

11:18.500 --> 11:22.710
#We'll drive you crazy #

11:22.710 --> 11:24.280
#You keep on shoutin' #

11:24.280 --> 11:25.790
#You keep on shoutin'... #

11:25.790 --> 11:27.790
Happy holidays, sport.

11:27.790 --> 11:30.790
Nothing like a small,
intimate gathering among friends.

11:30.790 --> 11:34.300
I'm hoping for a little
seasonal caroling myself.

11:34.300 --> 11:36.300
When did you
get back?

11:36.300 --> 11:37.300
This morning.

11:37.300 --> 11:39.300
Are you gonna stay
a while?

11:39.300 --> 11:41.300
Yeah.
How are you doing?

11:41.300 --> 11:43.300
Working for a living.

11:43.300 --> 11:44.300
Working?

11:44.300 --> 11:47.310
Well, my fingers
to the bone, friend.

11:47.310 --> 11:49.310
Are you staying
in school?

11:49.310 --> 11:50.310
Yeah.

11:50.310 --> 11:53.310
Don't fuck off.
Don't be a bum.

11:53.310 --> 11:54.820
Like you?

11:54.820 --> 11:56.820
Just like me.

11:56.820 --> 12:00.790
You look like you could use
a little Christmas cheer.

12:00.790 --> 12:01.750
No.

12:01.750 --> 12:04.760
Come on, Clay.
Old habits never die.

12:04.760 --> 12:06.890
They just hibernate.

12:06.890 --> 12:08.520
Old dealers?

12:08.520 --> 12:10.590
They go to jail, right?

12:10.590 --> 12:13.600
Play handball
with the Wall Street guys.

12:13.600 --> 12:16.470
You don't belong here.
These people are assholes.

12:16.470 --> 12:19.530
Who gives a fuck
about these people?

12:19.530 --> 12:22.670
I don't know, Rip.
Good customers though, huh?

12:22.670 --> 12:24.110
Bread and butter.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.710
Blair's upstairs.

12:29.890 --> 12:34.880
# I wanna rock and roll
all nite #

12:34.880 --> 12:36.720
#And party every day #

12:36.720 --> 12:39.630
# I wanna rock and roll
all nite #

12:39.630 --> 12:41.290
Ahh!

12:41.290 --> 12:43.060
#And party every day #

12:43.060 --> 12:47.070
# I wanna rock and roll
all nite ##

12:47.070 --> 12:48.400
Sammy!

12:48.400 --> 12:52.410
...Keep right
on the floor.

12:52.410 --> 12:55.840
They really belong
to the company.

13:12.930 --> 13:16.300
Hello, Clay.

13:23.110 --> 13:24.700
Bye, Blair.

13:27.780 --> 13:29.210
Hi, Clay.

13:29.210 --> 13:29.960
Hi.

13:30.950 --> 13:34.040
Merry Christmas.

13:34.040 --> 13:35.980
You look pale.

13:35.980 --> 13:39.890
Santa's gonna put
a suntan in my stocking.

13:39.890 --> 13:41.890
So how's school?

13:43.960 --> 13:45.390
Great.

13:45.390 --> 13:47.400
You know, school.

13:48.960 --> 13:51.020
Well, you--
you look great.

13:51.020 --> 13:52.970
I thought
I looked pale.

13:52.970 --> 13:55.830
Well, you look
pale and great.

13:55.830 --> 13:57.400
Have you seen Julian?

13:57.400 --> 13:58.150
No.

13:59.310 --> 14:01.330
He misses you--

14:01.330 --> 14:03.940
The three of us--
like high school.

14:03.940 --> 14:06.680
Why did you call?

14:08.420 --> 14:10.680
I wanted to.

14:10.680 --> 14:12.350
Good reason.

14:14.090 --> 14:16.020
Well, there's more.

14:16.020 --> 14:17.020
I'm here.

14:18.430 --> 14:21.360
I think Julianâ€™s
in a lot of trouble.

14:21.360 --> 14:22.360
Julian?

14:22.360 --> 14:25.370
I didn't know
who else to call.

14:25.370 --> 14:28.370
- I can think of 500 people downstairs.
- No, he's in trouble.

14:30.270 --> 14:32.210
Old trouble
or new trouble?

14:32.210 --> 14:36.210
He disappears and comes back
like nothing happened.

14:36.210 --> 14:38.210
He's wasted
all the time.

14:38.210 --> 14:41.220
Julian's been doing that
since he was 10.

14:41.220 --> 14:43.270
No, he gets
really sick.

14:43.270 --> 14:46.220
It's not like you remember.
Talk to him.

14:46.220 --> 14:50.880
- I didn't come home to talk to Julian.
- Please.

14:50.880 --> 14:52.860
- I got to go.
- No, um--

14:54.460 --> 14:56.860
Do you ever think
about me?

14:56.860 --> 14:57.700
Do you?

14:59.800 --> 15:00.890
Yeah.

15:02.400 --> 15:04.340
All the time.

15:13.720 --> 15:14.580
# Kick it #

15:14.580 --> 15:15.840
#Yeah #

15:22.360 --> 15:24.550
No, not beautiful
beautiful--

15:24.550 --> 15:25.590
<i>Beautiful.</i>

15:25.590 --> 15:27.530
- Who's he going with?
- Nobody!

15:27.530 --> 15:29.530
<i>Who was he
going with?</i>

15:29.530 --> 15:31.430
He is not a slut.

15:31.430 --> 15:34.370
He hasn't slept with anybody.
He's a nun!

15:34.370 --> 15:35.870
Swear?

15:35.870 --> 15:37.870
He slept
with Kim--once.

15:37.870 --> 15:39.770
The hit list.

15:41.210 --> 15:42.370
Hey!

15:42.370 --> 15:45.880
Tequila shot,
and a shotgun for my buddy.

15:45.880 --> 15:47.880
What do you think?

15:47.880 --> 15:50.380
It's one barrel,
two shots, huh?

15:50.380 --> 15:52.920
Quench that thirst
for revenge?

15:57.190 --> 15:59.130
- When did you get back?
- Today.

16:01.760 --> 16:04.890
Well, you look
very collegiate.

16:06.640 --> 16:08.230
- How was it?
- What?

16:08.230 --> 16:09.290
School.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.370
Harder than I thought.

16:14.910 --> 16:16.500
Still pissed?

16:19.150 --> 16:20.080
No.

16:21.480 --> 16:22.540
Liar.

16:22.540 --> 16:24.050
I'm not.

16:28.720 --> 16:32.020
Well, it's been sentimental.
Got to go.

16:36.200 --> 16:37.860
# Bo di di bo
de bo di di bo #

16:37.860 --> 16:39.660
# Bum  di di bum di di bum #

16:39.660 --> 16:40.700
#Yeah #

16:40.700 --> 16:42.700
#Ah, yeah, hey, ah #

16:42.700 --> 16:43.860
# Bom did dee ba #

16:43.860 --> 16:45.370
# Don't you know it? ##

16:45.370 --> 16:47.500
We'll bring Clay with us.
Clay!

16:47.500 --> 16:49.510
- Clay!
- Clay!

16:49.510 --> 16:51.070
- Hello!
- Hi!

16:51.070 --> 16:52.370
I'm out of here,
guys.

16:52.370 --> 16:55.380
No, you're not.
This is the holiday hour.

16:55.380 --> 16:57.390
You can't argue
with him.

16:57.390 --> 17:00.390
We'll go out--
just the three of us.

17:00.390 --> 17:02.820
Whoa! Blackout!

17:02.820 --> 17:05.829
Listen, you must party
with Julian and Blair.

17:05.829 --> 17:08.829
How long is this
going to last?

17:08.829 --> 17:10.829
I'm out of here,
guys.

17:10.829 --> 17:13.270
I will beg.
Blair will plead.

17:13.270 --> 17:16.339
Please.

17:16.339 --> 17:18.339
Ok, fine.
It's your loss.

17:20.640 --> 17:21.579
Let's do it!

17:23.069 --> 17:25.569
#Jingle bells #

17:25.569 --> 17:28.079
#Jingle all the way #

17:28.079 --> 17:30.140
# Oh, what fun
it is to ride #

17:30.140 --> 17:32.110
# In a red Corvette today #

17:32.110 --> 17:32.980
# Hey, hey, hey #

17:32.980 --> 17:35.550
#Jingle bells #

17:35.550 --> 17:37.090
#Jingle-- Hark #

17:37.090 --> 17:39.710
#The herald angels sing #

17:39.710 --> 17:41.490
# Fa la la la la #

17:41.490 --> 17:43.150
# La la la la #

17:43.150 --> 17:44.720
# 'Tis the season #

17:44.720 --> 17:46.760
Where are we going?

17:46.760 --> 17:48.590
Where'd we used to go?

17:48.590 --> 17:50.760
# La la ha ha #

17:54.210 --> 17:57.770
# Silent night #

17:57.770 --> 18:01.040
# Holy night #

18:01.040 --> 18:04.480
# Round yon virgin #

18:04.480 --> 18:05.740
Me?

18:05.740 --> 18:07.150
# Mother and child ##

18:07.150 --> 18:07.880
Julian!

18:08.950 --> 18:10.350
Come here!

18:14.960 --> 18:16.260
Thank you.

18:23.200 --> 18:24.570
Oh, what do I do?

18:24.570 --> 18:27.570
You guys have heard
of the Panic Club?

18:27.570 --> 18:29.570
Ninth and Figueroa.

18:29.570 --> 18:31.400
You guys are from Reseda?
Just kidding.

18:31.400 --> 18:33.440
No, I'm about to own it.

18:33.440 --> 18:36.410
Be nice to Julian,
would you, please?

18:36.410 --> 18:37.660
Sure.

18:38.950 --> 18:42.580
You don't understand.
He tried so hard.

18:42.580 --> 18:46.210
That record deal fell apart.
He lost his money his father gave him.

18:46.210 --> 18:48.260
But he wouldn't give up.

18:48.260 --> 18:50.420
He borrowed money from Rip.

18:50.420 --> 18:52.550
He worked day and night.

18:52.550 --> 18:55.390
He did everything he could
to keep it going.

18:55.390 --> 18:57.260
Nothing helped.

18:57.260 --> 18:59.270
Julian was so hurt.

18:59.270 --> 19:04.370
I don't think he ever really,
you know, failed before.

19:05.310 --> 19:07.040
He got high
all the time.

19:07.040 --> 19:11.050
Once he faced his father,
he was so fucked up

19:11.050 --> 19:13.580
Mr. Wells finally
kicked him out.

19:16.290 --> 19:19.220
Julian needs you, Clay.
He was always there for you.

19:24.560 --> 19:25.890
Hey.

19:27.800 --> 19:31.230
Cheer up, will you?
It's Christmas.

19:31.230 --> 19:33.530
Remember the infamous
coffee cup?

19:33.530 --> 19:35.660
Oh, no, don't, please.

19:35.660 --> 19:39.730
Oh, yes. How to seduce Blair
without really trying.

19:39.730 --> 19:43.010
There's the smile.
It's nice to see it again.

19:47.750 --> 19:50.980
10 years together--
that's half our lives.

20:02.830 --> 20:06.270
# Livin' in a shack
in a one-horse town #

20:06.270 --> 20:09.830
#Tryin' to get to heaven
'fore the sun goin' down #

20:09.830 --> 20:14.110
# Lizard in a bottle, yeah #

20:15.480 --> 20:19.180
# Dizzy in a haze
for 40 days #

20:19.180 --> 20:22.280
# Hey there,
little devil #

20:22.280 --> 20:24.290
Got a minute,
sweetheart?

20:24.290 --> 20:25.790
Surely.

20:25.790 --> 20:28.450
We gots to talk
business, friend.

20:28.450 --> 20:31.290
Relax. I'll pay you.
Just trust me.

20:31.290 --> 20:33.800
I don't want to
trust you.

20:33.800 --> 20:36.300
I just want my 50K.

20:36.300 --> 20:38.300
Patience is next
to godliness.

20:38.300 --> 20:40.800
It's the flip side
of cleanliness,

20:40.800 --> 20:42.810
but it's still pretty
fuckin' important.

20:42.810 --> 20:45.310
What are we talking about,
Julian?

20:45.310 --> 20:49.310
- You giving me a ''G'' on spec.
- No. No way.

20:49.310 --> 20:53.320
Very attractive girls
falling all over me for some blow.

20:53.320 --> 20:55.010
Just hook me.

20:55.010 --> 20:56.050
No.

20:56.050 --> 20:58.450
This is the last time.

21:00.890 --> 21:03.950
As soon as the club deal goes through,
I'm recashing you every penny.

21:03.950 --> 21:05.460
I hope so.

21:05.460 --> 21:07.520
Well, don't hope.
Trust.

21:07.520 --> 21:11.090
# Lizard in a bottle, yeah #

21:11.090 --> 21:14.700
# Come in, little devil #

21:14.700 --> 21:18.260
# Be my little angel #

21:18.260 --> 21:22.070
# Come on, little devil #

21:22.070 --> 21:27.550
# Be my-y-y a-a-angel ##

21:32.690 --> 21:34.020
# I believe #

21:41.630 --> 21:42.530
# I believe #

21:52.140 --> 21:53.300
Huh?

21:53.300 --> 21:56.310
- What are you listening to?
- What?

21:56.310 --> 21:57.780
I can't...

22:02.190 --> 22:03.980
some kind of
Eastern philosophy?

22:05.160 --> 22:06.250
# I believe ya #

22:17.000 --> 22:19.760
# I believe #

22:19.760 --> 22:20.530
# I believe ##

22:27.580 --> 22:29.440
What's your name?

22:29.440 --> 22:30.280
Richard.

22:30.280 --> 22:31.180
Hi.

22:34.850 --> 22:37.790
You're gonna give me
a negative self-image.

22:37.790 --> 22:39.290
Impossible.

22:39.290 --> 22:41.520
This is great,
isn't it?

22:41.520 --> 22:44.360
The three of us together,
seeing you again.

22:45.500 --> 22:47.400
You happy or sad?

22:47.400 --> 22:50.060
I'm not sad.

22:51.140 --> 22:52.570
You don't look happy.

22:52.570 --> 22:54.970
But do I look good?

22:54.970 --> 22:57.060
Always.

22:57.060 --> 22:59.940
You're gonna get
real serious now, huh?

23:02.480 --> 23:03.230
No.

23:05.150 --> 23:06.810
I'm sorry.

23:07.790 --> 23:09.750
What for?

23:09.750 --> 23:11.120
Everything.

23:13.320 --> 23:15.520
It doesn't matter anymore.

23:15.520 --> 23:18.080
I just wish that you knew.

23:18.080 --> 23:21.260
It's not the same
with you and me.

23:21.260 --> 23:23.200
It's not the same.

23:23.200 --> 23:25.030
Well, what's it like?

23:25.030 --> 23:29.270
When you left,
you left the both of us.

23:29.270 --> 23:32.280
Everything just changed
so quickly.

23:32.280 --> 23:34.280
Julian needed somebody.

23:34.280 --> 23:37.040
I guess I needed
somebody, too.

23:38.320 --> 23:40.250
It doesn't matter.
Forget it.

23:40.250 --> 23:42.790
- Did you talk to Julian?
- No.

23:42.790 --> 23:44.790
I asked you
to talk to him.

23:44.790 --> 23:47.790
All right, I'll call Betty Ford,
get him a room.

23:47.790 --> 23:51.290
-Just talk to him. He's your friend too.
-It's funny.

23:51.290 --> 23:55.800
When you called me,
I thought I was coming home to see you.

24:03.730 --> 24:05.820
# Stop actin' so crazy #

24:05.820 --> 24:09.230
#You say your mommy ain't home,
it ain't my concern #

24:09.230 --> 24:12.990
#Just don't play with me,
and you won't get burned #

24:12.990 --> 24:15.830
# I have only
one itchin' desire #

24:15.830 --> 24:19.360
# Let me stand
next to your fire #

24:19.360 --> 24:20.910
# Stand, yeah #

24:20.910 --> 24:24.170
# Let me stand, baby #

24:24.170 --> 24:26.840
# Let me stand #

24:26.840 --> 24:30.010
# Ohh, let me stand #

24:30.010 --> 24:32.020
#Aow! #

24:32.020 --> 24:35.020
# Oh, move over, Rover #

24:35.020 --> 24:38.080
#And let Jimi take over #

24:38.080 --> 24:41.290
#Yeah, you know
what I'm talkin' about #

24:41.290 --> 24:43.850
#Yeah,
get on with it, baby #

24:58.110 --> 24:59.700
#That's what I'm
talkin' about #

25:01.020 --> 25:02.070
# Now, dig this #

25:06.620 --> 25:08.150
# Now, listen, baby #

25:08.150 --> 25:09.710
#You try to give me
your money #

25:09.710 --> 25:11.920
#You better save it, babe #

25:11.920 --> 25:14.990
# Save it
for your rainy day #

25:14.990 --> 25:18.090
# I have only
one burnin' desire #

25:18.090 --> 25:20.930
# Let me stand
next to your fire ##

25:36.250 --> 25:38.340
Thought I'd
find you here.

25:38.340 --> 25:41.180
I'm having trouble
at home.

25:41.180 --> 25:43.190
Which one?

25:43.190 --> 25:45.190
All of them.

25:48.600 --> 25:50.690
Who drove?

25:50.690 --> 25:52.530
You did.

25:53.940 --> 25:55.490
Ahh.

25:55.490 --> 25:57.700
Oh, parking is key.

25:58.770 --> 26:01.140
You ever think
about going back?

26:01.140 --> 26:02.140
Where?

26:02.140 --> 26:04.140
School. I did.

26:04.140 --> 26:06.150
I just like
dropped by,

26:06.150 --> 26:08.150
took a nostalgic
walk around.

26:08.150 --> 26:09.150
And?

26:09.150 --> 26:11.150
It was weird.

26:11.150 --> 26:13.650
All the kids
had grown up.

26:13.650 --> 26:17.160
It wasn't like it was
when we were there.

26:17.160 --> 26:19.190
Think they miss us?

26:19.190 --> 26:19.940
No.

26:21.060 --> 26:24.660
Come on, Clay Easton,
Julian Wells--

26:24.660 --> 26:26.170
Legends, baby.

26:26.170 --> 26:28.170
We could do anything.

26:28.170 --> 26:30.670
What are you going to do?

26:30.670 --> 26:32.500
Take a nap.

26:32.500 --> 26:34.170
After that?

26:34.170 --> 26:35.170
Business.

26:35.170 --> 26:37.180
Are you dealing?

26:37.180 --> 26:40.180
My most lofty ambition
is to deal.

26:40.180 --> 26:42.180
You look bad.

26:42.180 --> 26:44.680
What's going on?
I'm serious.

26:44.680 --> 26:48.690
I'm seriously getting frustrated
with these questions.

26:48.690 --> 26:51.690
Someday we're gonna
look back on this.

26:51.690 --> 26:53.690
It's all gonna seem groovy.

27:03.100 --> 27:06.300
- Are you going to see Blair?
- Yeah. She's working downtown.

27:09.210 --> 27:11.140
Give her my love.

27:20.920 --> 27:23.150
The soap is fine.

27:23.150 --> 27:25.660
There are flecks on her neck.

27:25.660 --> 27:28.160
You can't see anything.

27:28.160 --> 27:30.490
Take care of the flecks.

27:30.490 --> 27:32.660
Great. Great.

27:34.070 --> 27:37.160
Sign the contracts
for next week's shoot.

27:37.160 --> 27:39.430
We got to get
them signed.

27:39.430 --> 27:43.240
If you want a new bar,
get rid of the flecks.

27:43.240 --> 27:46.870
This shoot better be over by Friday.
I've got Rose Bowl tickets.

27:54.920 --> 27:57.360
Come in.

28:02.930 --> 28:03.680
Hi.

28:04.430 --> 28:08.130
I always wondered about
the glamorous life of a fashion model.

28:08.130 --> 28:10.640
Well, now you know.

28:10.640 --> 28:13.140
Oh, my neck
is killing me.

28:13.140 --> 28:15.140
Will you rub my neck?

28:15.140 --> 28:16.140
Yeah.

28:20.210 --> 28:23.150
- I spoke with Julian.
- Yeah?

28:23.150 --> 28:25.480
He doesn't want my help.

28:25.480 --> 28:29.150
Oh, Julian is a mess.
He's out of control.

28:29.150 --> 28:31.160
You saw him.

28:31.160 --> 28:33.160
And you're not?

28:33.160 --> 28:35.160
I can quit anytime.

28:35.160 --> 28:38.160
It's all the control
I need.

28:38.160 --> 28:39.790
I'm impressed.

28:41.670 --> 28:45.470
Do you want to go out tonight?
We could go to some clubs.

28:46.510 --> 28:47.260
No.

28:49.440 --> 28:51.840
I'm taking off
right after Christmas.

28:51.840 --> 28:53.210
Why?

28:53.210 --> 28:56.510
Things didn't work out
the way I thought.

28:58.750 --> 29:02.150
I thought you
were staying longer.

29:02.150 --> 29:05.220
I was hoping we could
spend some time together.

29:06.160 --> 29:08.130
Well, maybe next time.

29:08.130 --> 29:10.630
Yeah, next time.

29:10.630 --> 29:13.030
I'll call you
before I go.

29:13.030 --> 29:14.030
- Will you?
- Yeah.

29:14.030 --> 29:16.040
Okay, great.

29:18.540 --> 29:19.630
Bye.

29:23.210 --> 29:25.940
I miss you.

29:34.160 --> 29:37.150
Where the hell
is everybody?

29:37.150 --> 29:39.160
Robbie-nobb?

29:50.570 --> 29:56.010
<i># Who's that girl cryin'? #</i>

29:56.010 --> 29:59.170
<i>#I'll tell you
the reason she's blue #</i>

29:59.170 --> 30:02.680
<i>#She's lost you...#</i>

30:02.680 --> 30:04.180
Julian!

30:04.180 --> 30:05.510
Uncle Bob.

30:05.510 --> 30:07.180
You're early.

30:07.180 --> 30:12.250
This is a matter of great consequence
and potential global expansion.

30:12.250 --> 30:14.520
I'll bet.
How much?

30:14.520 --> 30:15.520
15K.

30:16.760 --> 30:19.200
Please drive.

30:20.770 --> 30:23.200
Very good stereo.

30:23.200 --> 30:26.210
<i># Who's that girl cryin'? ##</i>

30:29.410 --> 30:31.540
Why don't you borrow it
from your father?

30:31.540 --> 30:34.710
Come on. Dad lacks
a certain amount of imagination.

30:36.280 --> 30:37.720
Nightclubs?

30:37.720 --> 30:39.720
This is not
just any nightclub.

30:39.720 --> 30:43.590
<i>This is the infamous
Panic Club.</i>

30:43.590 --> 30:46.680
The ex-owner is now into conceptual
art-- another good money move--

30:46.680 --> 30:49.700
but what he's done thusly
is left behind a gold mine.

30:49.700 --> 30:51.230
I'm talking Panic addicts--

30:51.230 --> 30:55.290
kids who want fake fashion,
loud music every weekend religiously.

30:55.290 --> 30:59.240
I want to provide it for them,
at a reasonable fee, of course.

30:59.240 --> 31:03.840
Of course, but I am not
into investing into clubs.

31:03.840 --> 31:05.850
I know,
but it is a sure thing.

31:05.850 --> 31:08.180
It's low overhead.
There's high volume.

31:08.180 --> 31:11.180
It's the most strictly controlled
all-money business.

31:11.180 --> 31:13.690
It's not just
investing in a club.

31:13.690 --> 31:17.380
You're investing
in a blood relative.

31:17.380 --> 31:19.950
- 15 grand?
- I'm the son you never had.

31:19.950 --> 31:22.960
I got two sons.
I can't afford any more.

31:22.960 --> 31:26.970
But they're not like me.
So don't make me beg.

31:26.970 --> 31:30.370
- Okay, where is the place? Let's look.
- Cool.

31:30.370 --> 31:31.700
- You wanna bum?
- Please.

31:31.700 --> 31:33.210
My office.

31:51.290 --> 31:52.730
Dad?

31:58.300 --> 31:59.300
Dad?

32:26.260 --> 32:27.260
Dad?

32:28.430 --> 32:30.190
Hi, honey.

32:30.190 --> 32:32.200
I brought you a present.

32:32.200 --> 32:33.700
Wait a minute.

32:33.700 --> 32:35.700
I'll be right out.

32:35.700 --> 32:37.700
No, I gotta go.

32:37.700 --> 32:40.210
You sure?
Cindy'll order out.

32:40.210 --> 32:42.070
Sorry, I can't.

32:42.070 --> 32:43.700
Anything I can do for you?

32:43.700 --> 32:45.710
No, I'm fine.

32:45.710 --> 32:47.210
Merry Christmas.

32:47.210 --> 32:49.220
I'll see you Monday.

32:49.220 --> 32:51.220
Merry Christmas.

32:52.790 --> 32:55.720
I left your present
on the table.

32:55.720 --> 32:57.220
Thanks, sweetheart.

32:59.290 --> 33:02.660
Hi, Blair.
You look great.

33:02.660 --> 33:04.660
Thanks.

33:04.660 --> 33:06.670
Listen. If I don't see you,
merry Christmas.

33:06.670 --> 33:08.170
Oh, you, too.

33:08.170 --> 33:08.920
OK.

33:09.740 --> 33:11.170
Cindy.

33:58.730 --> 34:01.600
I didn't expect
to see you here.

34:01.600 --> 34:03.100
Changed my mind.

34:03.100 --> 34:05.100
I'm glad.

34:10.080 --> 34:13.270
<i>#I wanna jump
but I'm afraid I'll fall #</i>

34:13.270 --> 34:17.010
<i>#I wanna holler
but the joint's too small #</i>

34:17.010 --> 34:19.679
<i># Young man rhythm's
got a hold on me, too #</i>

34:19.679 --> 34:22.310
<i>#I got the rockin' pneumonia
and the boogie-woogie flu ##</i>

34:22.310 --> 34:23.949
Blair! Who's this guy
on your neck?

34:23.949 --> 34:25.960
-Julian!
- Oh, it's okay. He's familiar.

34:25.960 --> 34:28.960
Still, don't you think a little
goddamn consolation is in order?

34:28.960 --> 34:32.690
You guys gonna do vile things
to each other in public?

34:32.690 --> 34:36.060
Hey, don't underappreciate
my efforts, okay?

34:36.060 --> 34:37.659
My tact.
Just don't.

34:37.659 --> 34:39.670
This the plight
of the beautiful people?

34:39.670 --> 34:43.040
We're trying to have
a private conversation.

34:43.040 --> 34:47.310
All I can see is someone who needs
to even out. You want a drink?

34:47.310 --> 34:49.139
I want nothing from you.

34:49.139 --> 34:51.150
Now, that's a surprise,
Julian.

34:51.150 --> 34:52.880
Julian, don't start.

34:52.880 --> 34:54.650
You've done just about
everything this evening.

34:54.650 --> 34:58.920
I'd appreciate it if you'd stay out
of my fuckin' business.

35:01.330 --> 35:03.090
You need a drink,
sweetheart.

35:03.090 --> 35:05.600
Don't worry about it,
all right?

35:39.730 --> 35:42.670
- I'm sorry.
- No, it-- no.

35:45.740 --> 35:47.830
I want to go home, okay?

35:47.830 --> 35:49.840
- Okay.
- Okay.

36:12.170 --> 36:13.600
No, I don't.

36:21.070 --> 36:23.600
Wait a minute.
Wait. Hold on.

36:23.600 --> 36:25.110
Come here.

37:12.660 --> 37:14.090
Oh, God!

37:14.090 --> 37:16.090
Will you stop that,
please?

37:16.090 --> 37:17.420
Ha ha!

37:17.420 --> 37:18.930
Oh, we're here.

37:18.930 --> 37:20.430
Not yet.

37:21.830 --> 37:22.990
Oh!

39:34.430 --> 39:36.260
Put it down.

39:36.260 --> 39:37.930
Hi, Dad.

39:45.850 --> 39:47.780
This is
the Wells residence.

39:47.780 --> 39:50.780
Yes, yes, everything is fine.
Thank you.

39:50.780 --> 39:52.780
<i>Code 13472.</i>

39:54.990 --> 39:56.920
I'm real tired.
I'm going to go to bed.

39:56.920 --> 39:59.120
Not here!

39:59.120 --> 40:01.460
How about here?

40:01.460 --> 40:03.890
We talked about this.

40:05.100 --> 40:07.030
When? I forgot.

40:07.030 --> 40:09.190
Refresh my memory.

40:09.190 --> 40:10.900
You can't stay here.

40:10.900 --> 40:13.300
Live your life
anywhere but here.

40:17.940 --> 40:21.380
Just give me a second.
You're a father, I'm a son.

40:21.380 --> 40:23.510
I'm your son.
I'm sleepy.

40:23.510 --> 40:25.170
- Dad?
- Get out.

40:25.170 --> 40:27.190
I'll call the police.

40:37.630 --> 40:38.860
Fuck you.

40:38.860 --> 40:40.360
You can't--

40:40.360 --> 40:42.090
Get out--

40:42.090 --> 40:44.190
Get out of the house!

40:44.190 --> 40:45.700
Leave him alone.

40:45.700 --> 40:47.710
Always a pleasure.

41:23.240 --> 41:25.180
What are you
thinking about?

41:25.180 --> 41:28.150
What I'm going to
say to Julian.

41:28.150 --> 41:31.580
Nobody can say
anything to Julian.

41:31.580 --> 41:35.750
I'm going to school in a week,
and I want you to come with me.

41:35.750 --> 41:38.090
- No.
- I mean it.

41:40.130 --> 41:42.060
- I have a better idea.
- What?

41:42.060 --> 41:44.060
- Let's get married.
- Great.

41:45.200 --> 41:47.130
We'll have a big,
expensive wedding.

41:47.130 --> 41:50.760
We'll invite 2,000
of our closest friends.

41:50.760 --> 41:53.770
We'll have a couple kids
and find a great maid to raise them.

41:53.770 --> 41:55.970
- I'll raise them.
- You will?

41:57.710 --> 41:59.640
Can't we just
stay together?

41:59.640 --> 42:03.810
I'm going to school in a week, and
I'm shoving your ass in the suitcase.

42:03.810 --> 42:05.980
Come to my house for dinner.

42:05.980 --> 42:09.250
My dad'll be there,
and the whole family.

42:09.250 --> 42:11.350
It's Christmas, you know.

42:12.590 --> 42:13.840
Ahem!

42:15.090 --> 42:17.030
The door was open.

42:17.030 --> 42:19.360
What do you want?

42:19.360 --> 42:22.030
I'm lookin' for Julian.

42:22.030 --> 42:24.070
Is he around?

42:24.070 --> 42:25.370
No.

42:25.370 --> 42:27.270
Well, if you see him,

42:27.270 --> 42:30.370
you tell him
to give me a call.

42:30.370 --> 42:31.880
I'm Bill.

42:39.120 --> 42:41.050
You're Blair.

42:42.690 --> 42:44.620
I don't know you.

42:45.830 --> 42:48.020
See you later.

42:50.960 --> 42:53.060
Where would he sleep?

42:53.060 --> 42:55.070
Maybe Zuma--
Markie's party.

43:40.510 --> 43:42.540
Somebody's
looking for you.

43:42.540 --> 43:44.050
Who?

43:44.050 --> 43:47.810
Bill.
You know him?

43:47.810 --> 43:50.050
Bill--Billy.
He's very cool.

43:50.050 --> 43:52.180
He's an old friend.

43:52.180 --> 43:53.920
I don't remember him.

43:53.920 --> 43:56.550
You've been away
for a long time.

43:56.550 --> 43:59.000
I've met a lot of new
and interesting people.

43:59.000 --> 44:01.160
Why? Where'd you two meet?

44:01.160 --> 44:04.000
At the loft with Blair.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
# Dum da da dum ##

44:06.000 --> 44:08.010
Want to talk about it?

44:08.010 --> 44:09.010
No.

44:09.010 --> 44:11.810
- Do you want to fight?
- Nope.

44:11.810 --> 44:15.510
Congratulations.
This is the way it's supposed to be.

44:15.510 --> 44:17.520
Turnabout is fair play.

44:19.920 --> 44:21.850
Blair was good to me.

44:21.850 --> 44:24.860
I was lonely,
and I needed somebody.

44:24.860 --> 44:27.360
She was there.
It was nice.

44:27.360 --> 44:32.130
It wasn't exactly
the World Series of love, though.

44:36.840 --> 44:39.530
Oh, this is my club.

44:39.530 --> 44:42.700
Check me out.
I'm going to make a serious comeback.

44:42.700 --> 44:44.270
Great!

44:44.270 --> 44:47.540
Yeah, and I'll sneak in and take Blair
away when you least expect it.

44:47.540 --> 44:49.980
This will go on for years.

44:49.980 --> 44:52.140
What?

44:55.120 --> 44:58.490
Be good to her.
She really deserves it.

45:02.900 --> 45:04.990
Yeah.

45:04.990 --> 45:07.000
I'm going to go.

45:07.000 --> 45:09.500
Always leaving, you.

45:09.500 --> 45:11.500
Well, somebody's got to.

45:11.500 --> 45:13.000
Ha ha!

45:13.000 --> 45:15.010
Watch out for the sharks.

45:15.010 --> 45:17.200
- What about you?
- They know me.

45:17.200 --> 45:19.210
All right.
You need anything?

45:21.080 --> 45:22.510
All right.

45:42.100 --> 45:47.040
Thank you, Elaine,
for having us in your home.

45:47.040 --> 45:50.040
<i>Well, thanks for having me.</i>

45:50.040 --> 45:52.040
Alice, too.

45:52.040 --> 45:56.050
Um...this is a special
time of year.

45:56.050 --> 45:59.550
It's a time for family,
for friends.

45:59.550 --> 46:02.990
It's a time
for forgetting our differences,

46:02.990 --> 46:06.990
and for coming together
so that we might...

46:06.990 --> 46:09.990
well, uh, come together.

46:09.990 --> 46:12.000
Ha ha ha!

46:12.000 --> 46:15.000
It's clearly also a time
for incoherent toasts.

46:15.000 --> 46:18.000
It's an old family
tradition here.

46:18.000 --> 46:20.000
Um, well, merry Christmas,
everybody.

46:20.000 --> 46:24.010
May we all
love each other as we are

46:24.010 --> 46:27.010
and as we hope to be.

46:28.580 --> 46:30.010
Thanks, Elaine.

46:30.010 --> 46:30.850
Clay...

46:32.420 --> 46:34.680
Liz, Jenny...

46:34.680 --> 46:35.880
and Alice.

46:39.990 --> 46:41.520
Merry Christmas.

46:41.520 --> 46:44.190
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

47:00.110 --> 47:01.910
Oh, been waiting for ages.

47:01.910 --> 47:03.470
Where you been?

47:03.470 --> 47:06.990
- Traffic in this town's a joke.
- Look at these ceilings.

47:06.990 --> 47:10.490
The D.J. will show you around,
let you listen to the sound system.

47:10.490 --> 47:11.990
Look.

47:13.290 --> 47:15.890
This isn't a good time
for bad news.

47:15.890 --> 47:17.490
I can't loan you the money.

47:22.070 --> 47:23.070
Why?

47:28.340 --> 47:31.000
I spoke with your father.
There's no way I can--

47:31.000 --> 47:33.510
I know. I know.
That's cool.

47:33.510 --> 47:37.070
At least you tried.
Here, take a couple of these.

47:37.070 --> 47:40.080
They're like kind of
collector's items.

47:40.080 --> 47:42.850
Limited edition stuff.

47:44.320 --> 47:47.050
This doesn't mean
you're not my favorite nephew.

47:47.050 --> 47:50.220
- Come to our house for Christmas.
- Great.

47:50.220 --> 47:52.990
No, actually, I can't.
I made other plans.

47:52.990 --> 47:54.690
Julian...

47:56.500 --> 47:58.560
I'm sorry.
I really am.

47:58.560 --> 48:00.370
Me, too.

48:10.050 --> 48:11.420
Bye.

48:18.130 --> 48:19.560
Hey, Rip.

48:26.340 --> 48:29.740
<i>#I was walking down the road
the other day #</i>

48:29.740 --> 48:33.400
<i># When I hear
a little human say #</i>

48:33.400 --> 48:35.070
<i>#He said #</i>

48:37.150 --> 48:40.410
<i># You no see
me situation #</i>

48:40.410 --> 48:44.420
<i># You don't have
no accommodation #</i>

48:44.420 --> 48:48.080
<i>#Me have to sign on
at the station #</i>

48:48.080 --> 48:51.100
<i>#At 6:00
in the evenin'...##</i>

49:00.010 --> 49:01.970
You have something for me?

49:04.110 --> 49:07.550
Man, I had it
all worked out.

49:07.550 --> 49:09.550
Christ, I thought I did.

49:10.920 --> 49:14.040
I fucked up.
I don't have any money.

49:14.040 --> 49:17.990
I don't know where
I'm going to get it.

49:23.200 --> 49:25.220
Julian,
this cannot go on forever.

49:25.220 --> 49:27.230
You owe me a lot of cash.

49:27.230 --> 49:29.730
I'm carrying you
like I'm stupid.

49:29.730 --> 49:31.560
But if you just
give me a chance--

49:31.560 --> 49:33.570
Please don't cut me off.

49:33.570 --> 49:35.570
I'll do whatever you want.

49:37.340 --> 49:39.570
Listen, uh...

49:39.570 --> 49:43.080
I want you to do
a favor for me.

49:43.080 --> 49:44.330
Sure.

49:45.720 --> 49:50.090
You're going to work for me, just
for a while, till we're even-Steven.

49:50.090 --> 49:53.060
Business? Like sales?
I can do that.

49:53.060 --> 49:56.090
I just want you
to meet some people.

49:56.090 --> 49:58.930
They're very cool.
You'll like them.

49:58.930 --> 50:01.430
These are very important people,
Julian.

50:01.430 --> 50:03.160
Cool.

50:03.160 --> 50:05.260
Bill's gonna take you there.

50:05.260 --> 50:07.100
It's just a party.

50:13.180 --> 50:15.610
Everything's going to be
just fine.

50:15.610 --> 50:17.610
Even-Steven.

50:51.780 --> 50:53.650
# Oh, yeah! #

50:56.560 --> 50:57.720
# Lookin' for love... #

51:03.400 --> 51:04.760
#Tonight #

51:04.760 --> 51:08.100
# So shake it slowly #

51:08.100 --> 51:11.100
#And do the bump 'n grind #

51:14.270 --> 51:16.760
#Well, I can tell
you got a few reservations #

51:16.760 --> 51:19.040
# More value,
bang for the buck #

51:22.510 --> 51:26.110
# Shake it slowly #

51:26.110 --> 51:28.780
#And do the bump 'n grind #

51:28.780 --> 51:30.010
#Whoa! ##

52:38.060 --> 52:39.990
You enjoy the party?

52:42.190 --> 52:45.130
Can't hold.

52:45.130 --> 52:48.630
Got two more stops.
Then we'll call it a night.

52:51.700 --> 52:53.070
Julian!

53:23.170 --> 53:26.100
We haven't seen you
for a while, Blair.

53:26.100 --> 53:28.330
I've been busy.

53:28.330 --> 53:30.930
That's a--
a lovely dress.

53:30.930 --> 53:32.940
You modeling?

53:32.940 --> 53:36.000
Yeah, I had a great year.
Better than I expected.

53:36.000 --> 53:38.110
Are you planning
to go to college?

53:38.110 --> 53:40.340
I haven't
decided yet.

53:40.340 --> 53:43.550
You seem happy here.

53:48.190 --> 53:49.630
Sure.

53:51.200 --> 53:53.130
Are you playing tennis?

53:53.130 --> 53:56.130
No-- My elbow.

53:56.130 --> 54:00.140
I tried a different wrap,
but, you know.

54:00.140 --> 54:01.830
Yeah.

54:06.850 --> 54:11.080
It's a better environment for Clay,
all things considered.

54:11.080 --> 54:12.410
What?

54:12.410 --> 54:13.750
School.

54:13.750 --> 54:15.250
I guess so.

54:56.190 --> 54:59.130
What the hell
are you doing?

54:59.130 --> 55:01.060
Just watching.

55:01.060 --> 55:04.230
I feel like
Tiny-fuckin'-Tim.

55:08.420 --> 55:10.350
Come inside.

55:10.350 --> 55:12.510
No, no,
it's too crowded.

55:15.890 --> 55:19.290
- What's wrong?
- Do I look like something's wrong?

55:22.430 --> 55:25.520
- I need money, Clay.
- How much?

55:31.440 --> 55:32.930
How much?

55:34.580 --> 55:36.510
50,000.

55:36.510 --> 55:38.550
50 and change.
I could use that.

55:38.550 --> 55:40.380
Jesus.

55:40.380 --> 55:43.040
Yeah, Jesus.

55:43.040 --> 55:44.550
- What for?
- Drugged out.

55:44.550 --> 55:47.050
What do you think it's for?

55:48.460 --> 55:51.620
- All right. I'll talk to Rip.
- No, you won't.

55:51.620 --> 55:54.060
You don't wanna talk to him.

55:54.060 --> 55:56.060
I can't get that much--

55:56.060 --> 55:57.820
Not right away.

56:03.070 --> 56:05.060
Clay, I'm fucked,
all right?

56:05.060 --> 56:07.110
I don't know what to do.
You're the only one.

56:07.110 --> 56:08.770
What happens when you pay?

56:08.770 --> 56:10.670
- I don't know.
- Think about it.

56:10.670 --> 56:13.680
- Do you start over?
- Clay, I need the fuckin' money.

56:13.680 --> 56:16.840
I don't need a discussion on
the finer points of morality!

56:20.750 --> 56:22.950
How much do you have?

56:22.950 --> 56:24.180
Nothing!

56:33.830 --> 56:35.030
I'm out of here.

56:35.030 --> 56:37.040
Merry Christmas.

56:37.040 --> 56:39.040
Wait. Just wait.

56:43.110 --> 56:46.050
Just wait.

56:56.460 --> 56:58.050
Dad?

56:58.050 --> 57:01.060
- Yeah?
- Got a sec?

57:01.060 --> 57:04.100
I need your help.
I need some dough.

57:04.100 --> 57:06.430
- How much?
- I need 50 grand.

57:06.430 --> 57:07.800
50 grand?

57:07.800 --> 57:11.500
- You're not asking me for $50,000.
- Yeah, I am, Dad.

57:24.080 --> 57:26.020
What are you doing here?

57:26.020 --> 57:31.550
Trying to salvage what's left
of a very important relationship.

57:31.550 --> 57:36.390
Ah, Jenny, I've been sitting
by the phone, but it didn't ring.

57:36.390 --> 57:39.400
You don't call,
and you don't write.

57:39.400 --> 57:41.400
We just don't communicate,
you know?

57:41.400 --> 57:45.030
It pains me deeply to accuse,
but I just--

57:45.030 --> 57:47.040
I suspect you're
freezing me out.

57:47.040 --> 57:48.040
Yes.

57:50.440 --> 57:53.470
You're just such
a heartless preteen hussy.

57:53.470 --> 57:56.040
Why are girls so cold?

57:56.040 --> 57:57.040
Huh?

57:58.620 --> 58:00.550
Oh, and then she laughs.

58:00.550 --> 58:02.490
Girls learn this
really early.

58:02.490 --> 58:05.150
They break guys' hearts
in pieces.

58:08.560 --> 58:11.500
You know what
the sick part of it all is?

58:11.500 --> 58:13.400
You know you love it.

58:13.400 --> 58:17.490
- Uh-uh.
- Don't play innocent with me.

58:17.490 --> 58:19.510
I know what girls like.

58:19.510 --> 58:22.010
Diamonds are
a girl's best friend.

58:29.580 --> 58:31.520
Shit.

58:31.520 --> 58:34.020
I saw him go inside.

58:43.100 --> 58:45.530
Where did you get--
where's Julian?

58:45.530 --> 58:47.030
We were playing.

58:47.030 --> 58:50.040
Get that stuff off
before Ma sees you.

58:54.110 --> 58:55.540
Julian?

58:56.940 --> 58:58.210
Jesus.

58:58.210 --> 58:59.540
What?

58:59.540 --> 59:00.980
My mother's jewelry.

59:20.550 --> 59:21.990
Hey, Clay!

59:26.560 --> 59:29.500
# In-a-gadda-da-vida, baby #

59:29.500 --> 59:32.000
# Don't you know
that I want you? ##

59:32.000 --> 59:33.500
How you doin'?

59:33.500 --> 59:35.000
Seen Julian?

59:35.000 --> 59:36.500
No, I haven't.

59:36.500 --> 59:40.770
- You been here all night?
- All night. Sorry.

59:40.770 --> 59:43.970
# It's Christmastime
in Hollis, Queens #

59:43.970 --> 59:46.540
# Mom's cookin' chicken
and collard greens #

59:46.540 --> 59:48.980
# Rice and stuffin',
macaroni and cheese #

59:48.980 --> 59:51.610
#And Santa put gifts
under Christmas trees #

59:51.610 --> 59:54.050
# Decorate the house
with lights at night #

59:54.050 --> 59:56.490
# Snow's on the ground,
snow white, so bright #

59:56.490 --> 59:59.120
# In the fireplace
is the yule log #

59:59.120 --> 01:00:02.720
# Beneath the mistletoe
as we drink eggnog #

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:04.660
You seen Julian around?

01:00:06.730 --> 01:00:08.170
Thanks.

01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:16.180
Sweetheart,
you seen Julian?

01:00:16.180 --> 01:00:17.680
No, man, uh-uh.

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:24.180
# Run so loud and proud
you'll hear it #

01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:26.850
# It's Christmastime,
and we got the spirit #

01:00:26.850 --> 01:00:29.250
#Jack Frost's chillin',
the hawk is south... ##

01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:45.200
You seen Julian?

01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:47.710
No, man, I haven't seen him.

01:01:52.770 --> 01:01:54.710
Blair, how you doin'?

01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:56.710
You remember Bill?

01:01:56.710 --> 01:01:57.460
Hi.

01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:00.210
You look wired tonight.

01:02:00.210 --> 01:02:02.440
- Is there anything I can do for you?
- No, thanks.

01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:04.580
- You looking for Julian?
- Bill, please.

01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:07.590
Do you know where he is?
'Cause we called the loft, and I can't--

01:02:07.590 --> 01:02:10.120
-Julian doesn't stay there anymore.
- He doesn't?

01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:12.120
Where's Julian?

01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:15.160
Fuckin' game show.

01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:17.600
What are you doing to him?
What's going on?

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:19.100
Clay...

01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:22.160
Why don't you ask Julian?
I bet he knows.

01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:23.670
Fuck!

01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:29.070
Relax. Relax, sport. Julian will
show his face. He always does.

01:02:29.070 --> 01:02:31.670
You're on vacation.
Don't forget that. All right?

01:02:31.670 --> 01:02:34.180
See you later.

01:02:34.180 --> 01:02:36.340
# Don't be a slave #

01:02:36.340 --> 01:02:38.680
# No one can tell you #

01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:40.550
#You've got to be afraid ##

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:55.530
- Let's try the beach.
- I don't want to. I wanna go home.

01:02:55.530 --> 01:02:57.190
You want to find Julian?

01:03:01.280 --> 01:03:02.570
It's a coyote.

01:03:02.570 --> 01:03:03.910
We hit it.

01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:09.310
Nothing.

01:03:09.310 --> 01:03:11.650
Maybe we missed.

01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:14.550
You OK?

01:03:14.550 --> 01:03:17.560
This cocaine...
too much speed or something.

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:20.150
- That's a relief.
- What?

01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:26.030
You're fucked up, you look shitty,
but hey, all you need is better cocaine.

01:03:26.030 --> 01:03:28.000
You walking home?

01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000
- I've had enough fun for one night.
- Are we having fun?

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.010
- It doesn't feel that way to me.
- You don't know what you're saying.

01:03:34.010 --> 01:03:36.510
I know what you're doing.
I know what Julian is doing.

01:03:36.510 --> 01:03:39.510
- I'm not like Julian!
-Julian's messed up. Talk to him, Clay.

01:03:39.510 --> 01:03:42.670
Julian has a problem. What makes
you think you're so different?

01:03:42.670 --> 01:03:45.980
- You weren't here to help anybody!
- Do you want me to stay?

01:03:45.980 --> 01:03:48.490
- No!
- You want me to be just like you?

01:03:48.490 --> 01:03:51.990
Putting shit up my nose till it bleeds,
no matter how much my friends care?

01:03:51.990 --> 01:03:56.330
Very romantic. We'll all go down
together. I won't do it. I can't.

01:03:56.330 --> 01:04:00.700
I love you, but I am leaving
as soon as I can.

01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:56.810
Julian.

01:04:56.810 --> 01:04:57.980
Julian!

01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:01.190
You guys be careful!

01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:04.130
- You're gonna scare somebody!
- What's wrong with you?

01:05:04.130 --> 01:05:06.760
Nothing a little coke won't--

01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:09.000
- Let's get him to the hospital.
- No!

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.500
I'll handle it!

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:12.200
Come on. Come on.

01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:12.950
OK.

01:05:17.710 --> 01:05:19.650
It's safe inside.
It's home.

01:05:19.650 --> 01:05:21.540
Let's lie down right here.

01:05:21.540 --> 01:05:24.140
No, come on.
It's safe here.

01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:26.150
Come on in, OK?
See?

01:05:28.220 --> 01:05:29.150
OK.

01:05:30.490 --> 01:05:34.020
OK. See?
You're home.

01:05:35.830 --> 01:05:36.580
OK.

01:05:39.870 --> 01:05:43.270
- Come on, sweetheart.
-Just let me sleep.

01:05:44.270 --> 01:05:45.670
Wait, I got to go.

01:05:45.670 --> 01:05:47.670
Rip's looking for me.

01:05:47.670 --> 01:05:50.180
Shh.
Just take a deep breath.

01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:53.510
You can do it.
Go real slow.

01:05:53.510 --> 01:05:56.070
- I'm gonna throw up.
- The bucket's under the sink.

01:05:58.190 --> 01:05:59.810
Honey, hold on.

01:05:59.810 --> 01:06:01.820
OK, baby, hold on.

01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:03.360
Just hold on.

01:06:22.210 --> 01:06:24.140
OK, hold on.

01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:34.650
We're here, baby, OK?

01:06:34.650 --> 01:06:37.660
Just stay here
till I'm out, OK?

01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:54.660
Who's gonna take care of you guys
when I'm gone?

01:06:56.740 --> 01:06:59.180
Come here, baby.
Sit up.

01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:02.340
Come on.
Julian, sit up, OK?

01:07:27.570 --> 01:07:29.000
Drink this.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.510
It'll stop you
from throwing up.

01:08:11.150 --> 01:08:15.580
You don't know what it's been like
with Julian sick all the time.

01:08:15.580 --> 01:08:18.920
I'd get so angry,
but it didn't do any good.

01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:23.420
He'd just promise me he'd get better,
and then he'd start all over again.

01:08:23.420 --> 01:08:26.479
Police even came here once
looking for him

01:08:26.479 --> 01:08:28.500
and I was here.

01:08:31.069 --> 01:08:33.000
I took care of him.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:36.000
I did the best I could do.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.270
That's what it's been like
while you were gone.

01:08:42.080 --> 01:08:45.010
I'll do whatever I can,
whatever it takes.

01:09:10.310 --> 01:09:12.240
I'm in the tub.

01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:13.740
It's beautiful here.

01:09:13.740 --> 01:09:15.740
Five or six people.

01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:17.240
Come on up.

01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:19.250
I'm not gonna leave.

01:09:19.250 --> 01:09:22.220
Let me get back to you.

01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:24.220
Listen, leave Julian alone.

01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:27.880
Well, merry Christmas
to you, too, Clay.

01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:29.390
You heard me.

01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:30.720
You need a hobby.

01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:34.420
Bustin' your butt
for Julian is a waste of time.

01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:35.930
I know.

01:09:35.930 --> 01:09:37.930
I'll get the money.

01:09:37.930 --> 01:09:40.130
I'll sell my car,
whatever it takes.

01:09:40.130 --> 01:09:41.569
You've seen Julian recently?

01:09:41.569 --> 01:09:44.540
- You'll get what he owes you.
- You're right. I will.

01:09:44.540 --> 01:09:48.569
And you know something?
It's got nothing to do with you.

01:09:48.569 --> 01:09:50.580
Now, listen to me.

01:09:50.580 --> 01:09:53.080
I am not the problem here.

01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:54.640
Julian is.

01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:56.080
I've been patient.

01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:58.090
I let it slide.

01:09:58.090 --> 01:10:00.680
You know how much he owes me?

01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:04.190
Anybody else would have cut him off
a long time ago.

01:10:04.190 --> 01:10:06.190
Julian's dead.
Forget about him.

01:10:06.190 --> 01:10:08.460
I'm telling you that
as a friend.

01:10:08.460 --> 01:10:12.470
I'm not your friend, and I'm tired of
your bullshit. You leave Julian alone.

01:10:12.470 --> 01:10:16.530
Don't deal to him, don't give it to him,
don't fucking go near him.

01:10:16.530 --> 01:10:19.540
I'll get the money.
You just leave him alone, asshole.

01:10:21.410 --> 01:10:24.640
Who the fuck do you think
you're talking to, pal?

01:10:32.620 --> 01:10:33.880
Whew!

01:10:35.620 --> 01:10:37.560
How do you feel?

01:10:41.130 --> 01:10:44.060
My head feels like
a frozen pineapple.

01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:46.430
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

01:10:46.430 --> 01:10:49.060
Got a stogy for me?

01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:50.570
Cool.

01:10:54.140 --> 01:10:54.890
Mm.

01:10:59.150 --> 01:11:00.580
Where's Clay?

01:11:00.580 --> 01:11:02.480
He went home.

01:11:02.480 --> 01:11:04.040
Oh, it's Christmas.

01:11:05.250 --> 01:11:06.690
Yeah.

01:11:06.690 --> 01:11:08.520
Merry Christmas.

01:11:12.590 --> 01:11:14.530
It's not gonna
happen again.

01:11:14.530 --> 01:11:16.030
It's over.

01:11:17.770 --> 01:11:20.200
Thank you for
taking care of me.

01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:23.040
Anytime.

01:11:26.110 --> 01:11:27.540
You look great.

01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:28.540
Oh.

01:11:31.410 --> 01:11:34.040
We had fun, didn't we?

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:37.740
I mean,
some of the time we did.

01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:44.560
Yeah.

01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:46.060
We did.

01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:49.560
Yeah.

01:12:06.580 --> 01:12:09.510
Dad.

01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:12.280
What do you want?

01:12:13.590 --> 01:12:15.520
Just a couple minutes.

01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:27.930
My God, you look terrible.

01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:34.040
I was wondering
if I could stay at home tonight.

01:12:36.210 --> 01:12:39.150
I would love to wake up
and know where I am.

01:12:39.150 --> 01:12:41.740
It'd be a nice change of pace for me.

01:12:43.620 --> 01:12:45.550
I can't do that.

01:12:50.230 --> 01:12:53.990
I wouldn't ask, except that my options
are kind of limited right now.

01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:56.330
Julian, we've been
through this a hundred times.

01:12:56.330 --> 01:12:59.090
No, 101, actually.

01:12:59.090 --> 01:13:01.570
You conned your way through rehab.

01:13:01.570 --> 01:13:03.500
You lied.

01:13:03.500 --> 01:13:06.010
You stole.

01:13:06.010 --> 01:13:08.010
Look what you've done
to our family.

01:13:08.010 --> 01:13:13.010
I just need you to be my father
for one goddamn day

01:13:14.580 --> 01:13:16.520
and just help me.

01:13:21.590 --> 01:13:26.080
Can't you tell when
I'm telling the truth?

01:13:27.600 --> 01:13:28.350
No.

01:13:29.260 --> 01:13:32.530
Trust was the first thing
you ruined.

01:13:38.110 --> 01:13:39.540
Yeah.

01:13:46.110 --> 01:13:48.050
OK, I'm gonna go.

01:13:48.050 --> 01:13:51.240
There's this guy I owe
a large sum of money to.

01:13:51.240 --> 01:13:56.050
I know that's a big surprise,
but I'm gonna try to work it out.

01:13:56.050 --> 01:14:00.060
I'm gonna try to do something
right for once. I mean it.

01:14:01.860 --> 01:14:05.990
I just want you to wish me luck,
whether you believe me or not.

01:14:09.170 --> 01:14:10.500
Julian.

01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:17.940
Can you stay clean
for one week?

01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:21.520
For one damn week?

01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:26.020
I'll do everything
I can to help you,

01:14:26.020 --> 01:14:29.020
but I need you
to help me, too.

01:14:30.590 --> 01:14:32.530
I could try.

01:15:32.480 --> 01:15:34.410
You all right?

01:15:34.410 --> 01:15:36.420
I just got here.

01:15:37.990 --> 01:15:39.420
Rip did this.

01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:54.160
<i>Blair, it's Markie.</i>

01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:57.830
<i>Just checking to see if
you need a ride to the Springs.</i>

01:15:57.830 --> 01:16:00.430
<i>See you at Trends. Bye.</i>

01:16:00.430 --> 01:16:01.940
<i>[Beep]</i>

01:16:01.940 --> 01:16:03.380
<i>Hi, it's Julian.</i>

01:16:03.380 --> 01:16:08.040
<i>I'm gonna talk to Rip,
settle some business--</i>

01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:11.980
<i>Better late than never, right?
Anyway, I'm outta here.</i>

01:16:11.980 --> 01:16:14.720
<i>Merry Christmas,
and thank you for last night.</i>

01:16:14.720 --> 01:16:17.280
<i>Both of you.
I mean it. Bye.</i>

01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:18.790
<i>[Beep]</i>

01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:40.410
What are we gonna do?

01:16:40.410 --> 01:16:42.780
Find him.
Bring him back.

01:16:42.780 --> 01:16:44.910
It won't make any difference.

01:16:44.910 --> 01:16:47.420
He'll just start all over again.

01:16:47.420 --> 01:16:49.420
Not if he leaves.

01:16:49.420 --> 01:16:52.430
Julian would be better off
somewhere else.

01:16:52.430 --> 01:16:54.460
I'll take him with me
if I have to.

01:17:17.450 --> 01:17:19.390
Don't look so surly.

01:17:21.460 --> 01:17:23.390
Julian's in the back.

01:17:23.390 --> 01:17:25.890
How you doing?
You look great.

01:17:25.890 --> 01:17:27.330
Welcome.

01:17:27.330 --> 01:17:29.390
It's been a long time.

01:17:37.470 --> 01:17:39.460
Hello, Julian.

01:17:40.480 --> 01:17:41.410
Hi.

01:17:41.410 --> 01:17:43.840
I missed you.

01:17:43.840 --> 01:17:45.400
Mmm.

01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:56.920
- I got to talk to you.
- Sure.

01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:02.430
Have a seat.

01:18:03.770 --> 01:18:07.200
OK, just for a minute.
I gotta get back into town.

01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:13.960
Basically, uh--

01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:18.670
It's over. I'm quitting.
I'm not gonna work for you anymore.

01:18:18.670 --> 01:18:21.010
I'm not buying.

01:18:21.010 --> 01:18:24.380
I'm gonna clean up.
I'm probably going back into rehab.

01:18:24.380 --> 01:18:28.050
I'm just gonna get
my life under control.

01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:34.620
Julian, who the fuck do you
think you're talking to?

01:18:34.620 --> 01:18:36.890
You're a junkie.

01:18:36.890 --> 01:18:38.400
You're not gonna quit.

01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:40.900
- I'll get your money back.
- When?

01:18:40.900 --> 01:18:44.000
I don't know. I'm talking to my dad.
I'm gonna work it out.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.700
I just know I can.

01:18:46.700 --> 01:18:48.740
You look so sincere
when you say that,

01:18:48.740 --> 01:18:50.740
but I've heard
all this before.

01:18:50.740 --> 01:18:53.280
What are you telling me
that's new?

01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:55.150
Julian, make an effort.

01:18:55.150 --> 01:18:57.150
Give me a new excuse, at least.

01:18:57.150 --> 01:18:59.150
I've heard this shit before!

01:18:59.150 --> 01:19:02.750
The difference is
that I mean it this time.

01:19:02.750 --> 01:19:03.920
Good.

01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:10.500
Are you ready to
work for me tonight?

01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:11.900
No, I'm not.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.940
Julian, where you been hiding?

01:19:15.940 --> 01:19:19.440
Rip, how long have
we known each other?

01:19:19.440 --> 01:19:22.070
We've been friends.

01:19:22.070 --> 01:19:24.440
Yes, we are friends,
aren't we, Julian?

01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:26.450
Yeah.
For a long time.

01:19:26.450 --> 01:19:29.950
Please don't make me do this.
I can't do it again.

01:19:31.650 --> 01:19:35.450
I think you'd be surprised
at what you can do, Julian.

01:20:09.490 --> 01:20:12.430
I'll be back in a few seconds.

01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:24.830
# Let's swim to the moon, uh-huh #

01:20:24.830 --> 01:20:27.930
# Let's glide to the tide #

01:20:27.930 --> 01:20:29.940
That's a really cool tux.

01:20:29.940 --> 01:20:31.950
Yeah!
Where'd you get it?

01:20:31.950 --> 01:20:33.950
- Your dad?
- My mother!

01:20:33.950 --> 01:20:35.780
- Hey, guys.
- Clay!

01:20:35.780 --> 01:20:38.250
- Have you seen Julian?
- Not yet.

01:20:38.250 --> 01:20:40.750
- How about Rip?
- He's probably at the hotel.

01:20:40.750 --> 01:20:43.050
- What?
- He's got a suite.

01:20:43.050 --> 01:20:45.750
- Where?
- Laurel Palms.

01:20:45.750 --> 01:20:48.160
All right, thanks.
I'll see you later.

01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:51.160
# ...River on a #

01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:54.460
# Moonlight drive #

01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:12.420
Rip is over at the Laurel Palms.
Julian might be there.

01:21:12.420 --> 01:21:13.920
I hope not.

01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:15.920
Stay here.
I'll be back.

01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:17.420
Be careful.

01:21:17.420 --> 01:21:18.930
I love you.

01:21:18.930 --> 01:21:23.190
# Let's swim to the moon #

01:21:23.190 --> 01:21:27.530
# Let's glide to the tide ##

01:21:27.530 --> 01:21:31.330
USC won't let him in because
he's a heroin addict.

01:21:31.330 --> 01:21:35.140
Blair, where's your tux?

01:21:35.140 --> 01:21:37.300
Oh, we just drove out.

01:21:37.300 --> 01:21:41.440
- I don't know these people.
- Maybe they're from Palm Springs.

01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:43.450
Nobody's from Palm Springs.

01:21:43.450 --> 01:21:45.850
Frank Sinatra.

01:21:47.290 --> 01:21:48.760
Oh, darn.

01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:51.220
The party was
better last year.

01:21:51.220 --> 01:21:52.730
Kim, here.

01:21:52.730 --> 01:21:55.730
I think it was
exactly the same.

01:21:55.730 --> 01:21:58.160
Rusty pipes.

01:22:45.220 --> 01:22:46.160
Hi.

01:23:02.740 --> 01:23:04.110
Ohhh.

01:23:04.110 --> 01:23:06.110
Hey, what is this?

01:23:06.110 --> 01:23:08.610
I thought this was all cool.

01:23:08.610 --> 01:23:09.610
Hey.

01:23:12.180 --> 01:23:14.620
Who the hell are you, man?

01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:12.180
Make me understand, Julian.
I really want to understand.

01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:14.140
No, you don't.

01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:20.020
- You look like a fuckin' whore.
- Rip made me do that. I had no choice.

01:24:20.020 --> 01:24:23.110
Shit, man, you did it to yourself!.

01:24:23.110 --> 01:24:24.620
Fuckin' run away.

01:24:24.620 --> 01:24:27.120
That's what you're really good at.

01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:29.130
I'm not coming after you.

01:24:29.130 --> 01:24:32.190
- You don't know!
- Well, tell me!

01:24:32.190 --> 01:24:34.490
- Forget it!
- Get in the car.

01:24:34.490 --> 01:24:37.540
- Leave me alone.
- Are you gonna go back to Rip? Hide?

01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:40.900
- I wanna know what you're gonna do now.
- I don't know!

01:24:40.900 --> 01:24:44.370
Come with me. Leave with me.
I'll take you back to school.

01:24:44.370 --> 01:24:46.380
There's no reason to stay in L.A.

01:24:46.380 --> 01:24:49.780
- It's over. Let's go.
- Do I look like I'm ready for homework?

01:25:10.540 --> 01:25:13.600
# How low can you go? #

01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:14.350
Hi.

01:25:26.180 --> 01:25:27.620
Hey!

01:25:31.690 --> 01:25:33.120
What a waste.

01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:35.130
Oh, man, what a waste!

01:25:35.130 --> 01:25:37.130
Well, call a plumber.

01:25:41.700 --> 01:25:43.630
Nice ride there.

01:25:43.630 --> 01:25:46.640
Yeah, it is nice.

01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:48.140
You all right?

01:25:48.140 --> 01:25:50.140
I'll be right back.

01:25:50.140 --> 01:25:52.140
Just wait here, OK?

01:25:54.710 --> 01:25:56.650
I'll be one minute, OK?

01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:13.600
# I can't get your love #

01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:15.600
# I can't get attraction #

01:26:18.170 --> 01:26:22.130
# I only get a little
psychotic reaction #

01:26:23.580 --> 01:26:26.600
- Did you find him?
- Yeah, he's in the car.

01:26:29.610 --> 01:26:32.640
You don't have a clue
what you're getting into.

01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:36.620
This is not recess, and I'm sick
of playing fucking games with you.

01:26:36.620 --> 01:26:38.620
Everyone is accountable!

01:26:38.620 --> 01:26:42.130
Now tell me where the fuck Julian is
so I can get back to business.

01:26:42.130 --> 01:26:45.130
- Is that what you call it?
- Where is he?

01:26:45.130 --> 01:26:47.360
Why don't you
just leave us alone?

01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:49.560
Why don't I check the car?

01:26:52.100 --> 01:26:53.130
Bitch!

01:26:57.910 --> 01:26:59.970
Stop! Leave him alone!

01:26:59.970 --> 01:27:01.840
Stay out of it!

01:27:04.220 --> 01:27:05.650
Clay, come on!

01:27:07.250 --> 01:27:08.580
No!

01:27:20.100 --> 01:27:22.090
Come on! Come on!

01:27:26.170 --> 01:27:27.100
Clay!

01:27:27.100 --> 01:27:28.610
I'm all right.

01:27:28.610 --> 01:27:31.610
Wow!
What a party.

01:27:31.610 --> 01:27:34.110
You have enough gas
to get to college?

01:27:34.110 --> 01:27:35.610
Ha ha ha!

01:27:35.610 --> 01:27:37.610
I love you guys!

01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:23.530
Julian?

01:28:25.660 --> 01:28:27.600
I'm all right.

01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:31.600
I just got this uncontrollable urge
to fall down.

01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:34.610
Oh, let's walk with one another.

01:28:34.610 --> 01:28:38.400
I just want you to know
that I know how much you've helped me.

01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:41.100
You've helped me
when I didn't deserve help.

01:28:41.100 --> 01:28:44.110
You've been so kind to me,
no matter how much I keep fucking up.

01:28:44.110 --> 01:28:48.450
This is why I'm going
to make it up to you for everything.

01:28:48.450 --> 01:28:51.610
I'm going to deserve
your friendship.

01:28:51.610 --> 01:28:54.630
That's it. I wanted you
to hear it from me.

01:28:54.630 --> 01:28:59.630
I want you to stop me before I say
something grotesquely sentimental.

01:28:59.630 --> 01:29:01.630
You need a doctor.

01:29:01.630 --> 01:29:04.170
No, I don't.
I just need to get outta here.

01:29:04.170 --> 01:29:06.640
A couple hours sleep,
I'll be a new me.

01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:08.140
You're sure?

01:29:08.140 --> 01:29:09.640
Yeah.

01:30:01.160 --> 01:30:02.590
Julian.

01:30:02.590 --> 01:30:04.020
Come on.

01:30:05.690 --> 01:30:07.020
Jul--

01:30:10.100 --> 01:30:11.530
Julian.

01:30:31.090 --> 01:30:33.050
- Don't, man--
- What?

01:30:43.630 --> 01:30:44.380
No.

01:30:52.640 --> 01:30:53.390
No.

01:31:08.820 --> 01:31:09.570
No.

01:31:13.090 --> 01:31:15.930
Oh, my God.

01:31:15.930 --> 01:31:19.020
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

01:31:35.120 --> 01:31:37.050
I'm sorry.

01:31:39.120 --> 01:31:39.870
No.

01:31:52.630 --> 01:31:54.570
Oh, my God.

01:33:05.570 --> 01:33:09.510
I remember, Julianâ€™s mother
died when we were 5,

01:33:09.510 --> 01:33:12.510
and it was awful.

01:33:12.510 --> 01:33:15.520
Julian didn't cry,
though, or nothin'.

01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:20.990
He just sat by the phone because
his mom used to call him every day

01:33:20.990 --> 01:33:23.020
when she was away on business.

01:33:25.090 --> 01:33:29.030
Nobody could get Julian
away from the telephone.

01:33:29.030 --> 01:33:32.190
Mr. Wells, he called all our parents,
but nothing worked.

01:33:32.190 --> 01:33:35.930
So one day, Mr. Wells,
he sent Julian a telegram

01:33:35.930 --> 01:33:38.340
like it was from his mother,

01:33:38.340 --> 01:33:42.070
saying that she had died
and gone to heaven.

01:33:44.450 --> 01:33:47.640
I remember Julian
showing it to me.

01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:50.840
He carried it
around for a year,

01:33:50.840 --> 01:33:52.550
and he was OK.

01:33:57.120 --> 01:33:59.560
He was a tough little kid.

01:34:05.070 --> 01:34:07.000
I don't know.

01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:08.060
I did everything

01:34:08.060 --> 01:34:11.200
that I could do.

01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:11.920
Ohh...

01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:16.010
I'm going to miss him so much.

01:34:22.350 --> 01:34:24.510
Well, I'm going away tomorrow,

01:34:24.510 --> 01:34:28.520
and I want you
to come with me.

01:34:28.520 --> 01:34:29.270
OK?

01:34:30.860 --> 01:34:34.020
Yes, I want to go with you.

01:34:34.020 --> 01:34:35.530
I do.

01:34:37.970 --> 01:34:40.020
- I want to.
- Good.

01:34:42.770 --> 01:34:47.870
# My time has come,
the clouds are calling #

01:34:47.870 --> 01:34:53.040
# December wind
has come my way #

01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:57.480
#And now I feel
the world falling #

01:34:57.480 --> 01:34:59.880
#All at once #

01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:02.050
# It's too late #

01:35:02.050 --> 01:35:05.390
# Life fades away #

01:35:06.900 --> 01:35:10.490
#The night is my way #

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:17.940
#All thoughts slip away #

01:35:17.940 --> 01:35:22.450
#And even though
I must leave you #

01:35:22.450 --> 01:35:27.710
# Remember I love you #

01:35:27.710 --> 01:35:28.610
# I'll always be #

01:35:32.690 --> 01:35:33.590
# In your memory #

01:35:38.530 --> 01:35:43.300
# I will always
be with you #

01:35:43.300 --> 01:35:47.130
#When I am gone #

01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:50.890
# Babe, life fades away #

01:35:58.550 --> 01:36:02.920
# Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah #

01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:07.420
# Life fades away #

01:36:07.420 --> 01:36:12.430
# I'm tired of tomorrow #

01:36:12.430 --> 01:36:13.330
# Lost for today #

01:36:17.170 --> 01:36:20.100
# I long to hear #

01:36:20.100 --> 01:36:21.200
#That peaceful river #

01:36:27.510 --> 01:36:32.110
# My time is here #

01:36:32.110 --> 01:36:36.950
#And even though
I will miss you #

01:36:36.950 --> 01:36:40.460
# I must leave you #

01:36:42.860 --> 01:36:44.110
# Babe, life fades away #

01:36:51.540 --> 01:36:56.130
# Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah #

01:36:56.130 --> 01:37:00.800
# Life fades away #

01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:05.250
# So please forgive me #

01:37:05.250 --> 01:37:09.910
#And try not to cry #

01:37:09.910 --> 01:37:12.750
# I long to be #

01:37:12.750 --> 01:37:14.000
#At peaceful river more #

01:37:21.830 --> 01:37:23.630
# Forevermore #

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:41.280
# Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah #

01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:42.230
# Life fades away #

01:37:48.020 --> 01:37:48.970
# Life fades away #

01:37:52.860 --> 01:37:53.810
# Life fades away #

01:37:58.370 --> 01:37:59.210
#Away #

01:38:03.470 --> 01:38:07.240
# One last thing to say #

01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:08.240
# Life fades away ##
