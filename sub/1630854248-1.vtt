WEBVTT

01:38.567 --> 01:40.999
-Is now a good time?
-Um...

01:41.034 --> 01:43.309
I wanted to follow up
about the associate position.

01:44.072 --> 01:45.909
Right.

01:45.945 --> 01:47.104
Take a seat, Grace.

01:52.614 --> 01:54.611
I promise
I will not let you down.

01:54.647 --> 01:56.751
You didn't get it, Grace.

01:57.822 --> 02:00.393
Oh.

02:00.429 --> 02:02.389
Why?

02:02.424 --> 02:03.992
It's a client-facing position.

02:04.161 --> 02:05.760
Mentoring, recruiting,

02:05.795 --> 02:08.869
dealing with third-party
vendors who, let's face it,

02:08.905 --> 02:10.297
can sometimes be
a pain in the ass.

02:10.333 --> 02:11.937
And that's why I applied.

02:11.972 --> 02:13.335
I'm ready for those challenges.

02:13.371 --> 02:15.669
But you are more reserved,
Grace,

02:15.704 --> 02:18.143
and sometimes that reserve
comes across as,

02:18.178 --> 02:19.807
I don't know,
a little standoffish?

02:22.047 --> 02:24.013
I'm... standoffish?

02:24.582 --> 02:27.678
An HR associate
requires a particular skillset,

02:27.713 --> 02:30.214
someone outgoing, approachable.

02:30.250 --> 02:32.790
For the client to open up, you
have to also open yourself up.

02:32.826 --> 02:34.456
I-I can do that.

02:34.491 --> 02:36.658
I just need
the opportunity for it.

02:36.694 --> 02:40.968
Grace, you are a valuable
member of the HR team.

02:41.003 --> 02:43.295
I've been here
for three years, Claire.

02:43.330 --> 02:44.697
I work hard.

02:44.732 --> 02:46.303
Market analysis,
comps and benefits,

02:46.338 --> 02:47.802
I know it like
the back of my hand.

02:47.837 --> 02:51.078
I know you do, and there
is room for you to grow there.

02:51.113 --> 02:53.308
I...
I don't want to grow there.

02:53.343 --> 02:54.905
I want to do those other things.

02:54.940 --> 02:56.716
You're not ready
for those other things.

02:56.751 --> 02:58.015
I can be outgoing.

02:58.050 --> 02:59.284
I can be approachable.

02:59.319 --> 03:02.685
Just give me the chance
and I'll show you!

03:02.720 --> 03:07.587
Grace, we're not going
to hire you to make that change.

03:07.623 --> 03:09.626
You need to make
that change first.

03:11.130 --> 03:13.762
Shit, I'm late for an off-site.

03:14.903 --> 03:16.864
Let's keep talking, okay?

03:18.571 --> 03:22.235
A new back-office position
opens up in six months.

03:22.270 --> 03:23.371
Management.

03:23.406 --> 03:25.677
I think you'd be perfect for it.

03:25.712 --> 03:26.874
Okay?

03:27.945 --> 03:29.976
Okay.

03:40.157 --> 03:41.551
Oh, Grace!

03:41.587 --> 03:42.825
Oh, hey, Roshan.

03:42.861 --> 03:44.592
Hey.

03:44.628 --> 03:46.927
Um, I just wanted
to say thanks again.

03:47.901 --> 03:49.201
You don't have to.

03:49.236 --> 03:51.831
I gave you some
standard HR advice.

03:51.866 --> 03:54.966
You landed that promotion
all on your own.

03:55.001 --> 03:57.007
I told my dad
about it and he...

03:57.042 --> 03:59.003
almost hugged me.

03:59.038 --> 04:01.912
I think he was proud
or something.

04:01.948 --> 04:04.508
I'm sure he was.

04:04.543 --> 04:06.918
Yeah. Oh, listen,
we're going out for drinks
tonight to celebrate

04:06.954 --> 04:08.082
if you want to come.

04:08.117 --> 04:09.887
What?

04:09.923 --> 04:12.317
Drinks. With me.

04:12.352 --> 04:13.987
You in?

04:14.322 --> 04:16.627
Oh. Um...

04:21.061 --> 04:24.299
And Samir is coming
and some of the IT girls,

04:24.334 --> 04:25.900
and I invited Jennifer.

04:26.972 --> 04:28.707
Jennifer...

04:28.742 --> 04:29.909
Nice.

04:32.715 --> 04:33.974
So you'll come?

04:36.283 --> 04:39.850
Thanks, Roshan,
but I have plans.

04:39.886 --> 04:41.949
Have fun.

04:44.793 --> 04:46.855
Bye!

05:02.036 --> 05:05.671
<i> Next stop,</i>
<i>University Avenue,</i>

05:05.706 --> 05:08.712
<i>St. Andrew Subway Station.</i>

05:28.629 --> 05:31.000
<i>There's no way</i>
<i>you could take that guy down.</i>

05:31.036 --> 05:33.698
-He's fucking huge!
-I know,
what are you talking about?

05:33.734 --> 05:35.637
Honestly, the only
thing to do is you chip it and
you fuckin' go for it

05:35.672 --> 05:37.036
'cause that guy's a
monster, man.

05:37.072 --> 05:39.009
You're gonna get wrecked.
You should be scared.

05:39.045 --> 05:40.579
Carter!

05:45.715 --> 05:48.020
-What's up, coach?

05:48.055 --> 05:52.121
We're sendin' you down.

05:52.156 --> 05:55.420
Yeah, right.

05:55.455 --> 05:57.461
Really?

05:57.496 --> 06:01.091
Yeah,
there's a car waiting for you.

06:01.126 --> 06:04.267
Go back to the hotel.
Call your agent.

06:04.302 --> 06:06.969
Here's your per diem.

06:07.005 --> 06:08.367
No!

06:08.402 --> 06:10.134
Carter.

06:10.170 --> 06:13.003
Okay, I've been
a little off, but I'm good now.

06:13.039 --> 06:14.544
No,
you're not playing tonight.

06:14.580 --> 06:16.606
coach, you know me.
This is what I do!

06:16.641 --> 06:18.580
-I bounce back every time!
Tonight I've been focused--
-Carter.

06:18.616 --> 06:21.114
Carter, Carter!
Will you shut up?

06:22.552 --> 06:26.424
We needed you to work harder.

06:26.459 --> 06:28.395
You're a good player.
You really are.

06:28.430 --> 06:31.594
Maybe you're back with us
next season, but...

06:31.629 --> 06:35.296
we think this is
the best thing for ya.

06:35.331 --> 06:38.170
The minors?

06:38.205 --> 06:39.866
I gotta go to fucking Syracuse?

06:39.901 --> 06:43.210
No, you gotta
clear waivers first.

06:43.412 --> 06:45.575
Now, maybe it doesn't
take the full 24 hours.

06:45.611 --> 06:49.074
Maybe another team
picks you up, but...

06:49.109 --> 06:53.379
yeah, you gotta stay
in town for the night.

06:53.414 --> 06:56.051
Cool.

06:56.086 --> 06:58.621
So I just sit and wait around
until someone else decides

06:58.656 --> 07:01.621
-the rest of my life?
-Look, Carter...

07:01.656 --> 07:04.459
I was you once, okay?

07:04.494 --> 07:07.094
I know how this feels.

07:13.337 --> 07:15.476
Take care, son.

07:30.459 --> 07:32.386
<i>Let's talk about Tampa Bay,</i>

07:32.422 --> 07:34.728
<i>the team that proved</i>
<i>last year it doesn't matter</i>
<i>what you do</i>

07:34.763 --> 07:37.990
<i>in the regular season as it's</i>
<i>a new year in the playoffs.</i>

07:38.025 --> 07:40.029
Hey, can you
change the station, bud?

07:40.065 --> 07:42.135
<i>...against the Leafs--</i>

08:06.425 --> 08:08.228
-Joni, hey.
-Grace!

08:08.464 --> 08:10.560
I told you I would
clean up the living room,

08:10.696 --> 08:12.993
and I will.
Just relax already, okay?

08:13.028 --> 08:15.627
Doing a pretty good
job cleaning up here.

08:16.867 --> 08:18.496
I got some leads on
a few apartments.

08:18.531 --> 08:21.234
One of them is in the East End,
which sucks, but I'm trying.

08:21.270 --> 08:24.001
I promise I wanna get off
your couch more than you do.

08:24.036 --> 08:25.205
I talked to Roshan.

08:25.572 --> 08:27.213
Oh. Oh!

08:27.248 --> 08:29.778
And?
Tell me what happened.

08:29.813 --> 08:31.952
I think he likes Jennifer now,
so...

08:31.987 --> 08:33.544
It doesn't matter.

08:33.579 --> 08:36.682
They all went out after work
to celebrate his promotion.

08:36.717 --> 08:37.815
Why didn't you go?

08:38.151 --> 08:40.417
I'm not gonna tag along.
I'm not...

08:40.453 --> 08:43.429
Grace, I love you,
but you do this all the time.

08:43.464 --> 08:45.461
Just say yes
to something for once.

08:45.496 --> 08:47.393
I say yes all the time!

08:47.629 --> 08:50.769
-Do you?
-Yes.

08:50.804 --> 08:53.201
What about that cute guy
that worked at your food court?

08:53.570 --> 08:55.404
He worked at Subway.

08:55.739 --> 08:58.235
Okay, um...
Charlie's friend.

08:58.271 --> 08:59.906
The guy who spent
New Year's with us.

08:59.942 --> 09:02.348
That guy?
He was a total player.

09:02.384 --> 09:04.151
Your neighbour,
the comedian dude?

09:04.553 --> 09:06.349
He has a girlfriend.
But not at first.

09:06.551 --> 09:07.784
And you totally liked him.

09:07.819 --> 09:09.879
No, I just felt like
I always had to laugh

09:09.915 --> 09:11.422
at his jokes.

09:11.457 --> 09:13.056
This is what you do, Grace.

09:13.091 --> 09:15.926
You like a guy, and then you
get to know him just long enough

09:15.961 --> 09:20.499
to not like him anymore
so you don't have to date him.

09:20.534 --> 09:22.866
Why would I date
a guy I don't like?

09:22.901 --> 09:25.267
Because no guy is
ever good enough for Grace.

09:25.370 --> 09:26.840
That's not true.

09:26.875 --> 09:29.506
Really?

09:29.541 --> 09:34.212
Go talk to that guy over there.

09:34.247 --> 09:36.073
-No.
-Why not?

09:36.242 --> 09:38.242
-Because he's a stranger.
-Exactly.

09:38.277 --> 09:39.752
You don't know
anything about him.

09:39.787 --> 09:42.080
For all you know, he could
be the love of your life.

09:42.115 --> 09:45.618
I doubt it.
He has a ponytail.

09:47.657 --> 09:49.055
When are
you coming home?

09:49.090 --> 09:51.788
Uh, in a bit,
but I'm going out after.

09:51.823 --> 09:53.361
Where?

09:53.396 --> 09:54.967
Tunnel.

09:55.002 --> 09:56.095
Pass!

09:56.130 --> 09:57.833
Of course you pass.
You always pass.

09:58.169 --> 10:00.333
Look where it's gotten you,
in bed by- 30 every night.

10:03.111 --> 10:05.976
Grace!

10:31.672 --> 10:33.669
-Mr. Stone, you're back!
-Hey, Lisa.

10:33.704 --> 10:35.333
Uh, your gear just arrived.

10:35.368 --> 10:37.401
Oh, perfect.
Just leave it there for now.

10:37.436 --> 10:39.004
I think they made
a reservation for me.

10:39.039 --> 10:40.874
Of course.
Let me check.

10:42.749 --> 10:46.451
Here we go.
Deluxe suite, 10th floor.

10:46.486 --> 10:48.013
Oh, that won't be necessary.

10:48.048 --> 10:52.050
The team's covered the night.

10:52.086 --> 10:53.953
Lisa,
what's the nicest suite?

10:53.988 --> 10:56.659
Not the biggest, but the nicest.

10:56.694 --> 10:59.356
Like, if you were to stay here,

10:59.391 --> 11:01.928
which room would
you sleep in tonight?

11:01.963 --> 11:03.995
The Wellington Suite
on 32.

11:04.030 --> 11:05.764
The view is stunning.

11:05.800 --> 11:07.436
Is it available?

11:07.471 --> 11:09.303
Uh...

11:10.374 --> 11:11.509
It is!

11:11.544 --> 11:13.806
Perfect.
Upgrade me to that.

11:13.841 --> 11:16.174
Oh, Mr. Stone, I--

11:16.210 --> 11:18.342
First of all,
call me "Carter."

11:18.377 --> 11:21.687
And second,
it's on the team's dime.

11:21.722 --> 11:25.154
A drop in the ocean for them,
you know?

11:31.096 --> 11:33.796

<i>Dani Drake at Talent A.</i>

11:33.831 --> 11:35.465
<i>Leave me a message.</i>
<i>Thanks.</i>

11:36.733 --> 11:38.961
Dani, I checked in.

11:38.997 --> 11:41.472
Now what?

11:41.507 --> 11:43.469
Call me back.

12:04.133 --> 12:05.297
Grace?

12:05.332 --> 12:09.434
I'm gonna go now.

12:09.470 --> 12:12.965
I cleaned the living room.

12:13.001 --> 12:14.670
You should come to Tunnel.

12:14.706 --> 12:19.045

16:28.923 --> 16:29.925
Dani.

16:29.960 --> 16:33.296
What?
Wait, wait!

16:33.332 --> 16:36.866
-There you are.
-Thank you.

16:36.901 --> 16:37.997
Hi!
How's it going?

16:38.033 --> 16:39.636
Um, it's okay.

16:39.672 --> 16:41.032
I got a drink.

16:41.067 --> 16:42.502
Awesome.

16:42.537 --> 16:45.170
Now, I'll totally stay
if you want me to.

16:45.205 --> 16:46.645
What do you mean?

16:46.681 --> 16:48.408
I'm really liking Marcus.

16:48.443 --> 16:50.013
You met him
like seven seconds ago.

16:50.049 --> 16:52.510
I know.
I just feel a connection.

16:52.545 --> 16:54.785
I... want to
go home with him.

16:54.820 --> 16:56.952
-Joni...
-It's just...

16:56.987 --> 17:00.091
after Charlie, I, I...

17:00.126 --> 17:05.057
just really need this
tonight... you know?

17:05.093 --> 17:06.126
-Go.
-Really?

17:06.161 --> 17:07.326
-Yeah.

17:07.361 --> 17:08.591
-Give us two hours.
-Okay.

17:08.626 --> 17:09.759
And then
you can come back.

17:09.794 --> 17:12.136
-What?!
-He lives with his parents.

17:12.172 --> 17:13.606
Joni, you need
to find your own place.

17:13.641 --> 17:17.167
I know, I know, I know!

17:17.202 --> 17:18.575
Go...

17:18.611 --> 17:20.174
Have sex.

17:20.209 --> 17:21.239
-Be happy.

17:21.275 --> 17:23.511
I love you.

17:23.546 --> 17:25.783
That lip gloss looks
great on you, by the way.

17:25.818 --> 17:27.677
-Thank you.
-Bye!

17:27.713 --> 17:29.379
-What--

17:29.414 --> 17:31.251
Oh my God.

17:31.287 --> 17:33.657
Hi, can we get,
um, some shots?

17:34.930 --> 17:36.962
Oh my God,
I want that drink!

17:37.130 --> 17:41.534
Sorry, I just
don't know what to do here.

17:43.896 --> 17:47.297
Dani, I can't just sit around.

17:47.332 --> 17:48.737
Dani, wait!

17:48.839 --> 17:51.410
Wait! Fuck!

17:51.445 --> 17:53.737
What?

17:53.772 --> 17:56.108
Sorry,
I'm just having a bad night.

17:56.143 --> 17:58.342
Oh.

17:58.377 --> 18:00.044
You going back in?

18:00.080 --> 18:02.555
No.

18:02.590 --> 18:05.281
Yeah, me neither.

18:05.316 --> 18:06.886
Um...

18:06.921 --> 18:09.291
Do you know if there's another
bar around here somewhere?

18:09.326 --> 18:11.787
It's downtown.
There's bars everywhere.

18:11.823 --> 18:13.790
Oh, yeah.
I'm not from here, so...

18:13.825 --> 18:15.965
I'm not really
a bar person, sorry.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.204
That's okay.

18:21.336 --> 18:23.508
So, where are you heading now?

18:23.543 --> 18:25.302
Home.

18:25.338 --> 18:26.743
Well... sort of.

18:33.984 --> 18:35.951
Thanks.

18:35.987 --> 18:37.788
27 Crawford Street.

18:37.823 --> 18:39.086
Have a nice night.

18:39.121 --> 18:41.588
Hey, Carter!

18:41.624 --> 18:43.996
We need to finish that
conversation, my friend.

18:44.032 --> 18:45.632
-Where you goin'?
-Hey, what the hell?

18:45.667 --> 18:47.032
-Drive.
-Excuse me!

18:47.067 --> 18:49.030
Sorry, I have to
get away from that guy.

18:49.065 --> 18:50.703
Uh, Dalton Hotel.

18:50.738 --> 18:52.301
Sure. Just take my cab.

18:52.337 --> 18:55.870
It's fine.
It's just around the corner.

18:55.906 --> 18:58.807
Whatever.

18:58.842 --> 19:00.678
Thanks.

19:00.714 --> 19:02.709
<i> It costs £7</i>
<i>to stand on</i>
<i>the meridian line.</i>

19:02.744 --> 19:05.813
-<i> Is this a...</i>

19:05.848 --> 19:08.254
<i> Well, I just</i>
<i>thought it was quite ironic</i>

19:08.289 --> 19:10.180
<i>that you said it was £7</i>
<i>to stand on the line</i>

19:10.215 --> 19:12.047
<i>which runs</i>
<i>from the north pole</i>
<i>to the south pole.</i>

19:12.083 --> 19:13.985
<i>I thought, "I could probably</i>
<i>go and find</i>

19:14.020 --> 19:16.058
<i>a different bit of line</i>
<i>to stand on for nothing.'"</i>

19:16.093 --> 19:18.758
<i> I probably</i>
<i>accidentally stood on it</i>
<i>at some point tonight.</i>

19:18.794 --> 19:20.491
<i> You probably</i>
<i>owe that guy £7.</i>

19:27.138 --> 19:30.243
Dalton Hotel.

19:34.175 --> 19:36.414
Goodnight.

19:40.450 --> 19:43.322
Crawford Street,
right?

19:47.352 --> 19:49.486
Um...

19:49.521 --> 19:52.232
I'll get out here.

20:09.376 --> 20:13.376
Are you okay?

20:13.411 --> 20:16.214
I, um...

20:16.250 --> 20:18.148
I-I dunno.

20:30.861 --> 20:33.604
I just can't go home right now.

20:33.639 --> 20:36.307
My best friend's having her
weekly sexathon on my couch

20:36.342 --> 20:40.145
and now I'm homeless
for the next two hours.

20:40.180 --> 20:42.843
The old sock
on the doorknob, huh?

21:04.061 --> 21:07.098
I guess I can't
stay out here all night.

21:14.610 --> 21:16.408
I guess
we could grab a drink and--

21:16.443 --> 21:18.318
Sure, let's go in!

21:37.332 --> 21:39.102
This is your room?

21:39.137 --> 21:41.198
Yeah, they upgraded me.

21:45.208 --> 21:46.869
What do you do?

21:46.904 --> 21:49.045
-Well, I, uh--
-Never mind.

21:49.081 --> 21:50.610
I don't wanna know.

21:50.646 --> 21:52.784
What do
you want to drink?

21:52.820 --> 21:56.580
Um...

21:56.615 --> 21:58.781
What's over here?

21:58.816 --> 22:00.855
Uh, a bedroom?

22:25.215 --> 22:28.347
That view is...

22:28.383 --> 22:30.280
Yeah, I know.

23:43.160 --> 23:46.325
This okay?

23:46.360 --> 23:48.328
Mm-hm.

23:48.364 --> 23:50.592
Sure?

23:50.628 --> 23:52.571
Yes.

24:06.919 --> 24:08.516
A-OK.

24:08.552 --> 24:09.779
-Hmm?
-Hmm?

24:09.815 --> 24:13.385
Oh, no, keep going.

24:13.420 --> 24:15.286
Okay.

24:24.401 --> 24:27.100
Oh, hold on.

24:54.232 --> 24:56.030
You can continue.

25:23.160 --> 25:24.293
Um...

25:24.329 --> 25:26.790
What should I, um...

25:26.825 --> 25:28.867
-Hmm?
-Hmm?

25:28.903 --> 25:31.365
Uh-huh...

25:31.401 --> 25:33.765
It feels good.

25:33.800 --> 25:36.534
-Okay.

25:45.283 --> 25:48.753
Um, it's just I...

25:48.788 --> 25:51.957
I've never done this,
but it feels-- what should I...

25:51.993 --> 25:52.990
What?

25:53.026 --> 25:54.785
Hmm? What?

25:54.820 --> 25:56.753
What did you say?

25:56.789 --> 25:59.096
It feels good?

25:59.131 --> 26:00.594
Before that.

26:00.629 --> 26:04.970
I've never done this.

26:05.006 --> 26:07.673
Define "this."

26:13.012 --> 26:17.743
This.

26:17.778 --> 26:20.312
I've never done this.

26:25.918 --> 26:28.919
You've never had sex?

26:28.954 --> 26:33.295
Um... I-I have to go!

26:33.331 --> 26:36.297
Wait...

26:36.332 --> 26:38.434
Um...

26:38.470 --> 26:40.334
Sorry, uh--
No, wait.

26:40.369 --> 26:43.470
Did...?

26:49.942 --> 26:52.074
Hey!
Wait!

26:57.223 --> 26:59.285
Are you okay?

26:59.320 --> 27:03.318
This night has been
one humiliation after another.

27:03.354 --> 27:06.330
I don't even know
where I'm going.

27:06.366 --> 27:07.792
Want to go home?

27:07.828 --> 27:10.599
I'll take you home.

27:10.635 --> 27:13.499
Home!
I can't even go home.

27:15.001 --> 27:17.776
I just want this night to end.

27:22.711 --> 27:26.776
Let's go grab a drink.

27:26.811 --> 27:28.848
Alright?

27:28.883 --> 27:31.083
I mean, I'm sure there's...

27:31.118 --> 27:33.559
somewhere around here
we could go.

27:33.594 --> 27:36.357
I'm not from here
so I don't know, but...

27:36.593 --> 27:38.293
I could use a drink too.

27:41.133 --> 27:42.361
Okay.

27:42.730 --> 27:45.166
Yeah?
Okay?

27:48.437 --> 27:51.306
Um...

27:51.342 --> 27:53.779
That way?

28:05.656 --> 28:08.885
I'm Carter, by the way.

28:08.921 --> 28:11.126
Grace.

28:23.534 --> 28:25.643
You think
they still have food?

28:25.678 --> 28:27.874
It says
the kitchen's closed.

28:27.909 --> 28:29.380
What can I get you?

28:29.415 --> 28:30.948
Uh, a house red?

28:30.983 --> 28:33.442
I'll have a pilsner.
You still have food?

28:33.478 --> 28:35.687
Sorry,
kitchen just closed.

28:35.722 --> 28:37.520
Ah, no one
needs to cook anything.

28:37.555 --> 28:40.318
Just chips, crackers?

28:40.353 --> 28:42.451
We're both kind of
having a rough night.

28:42.486 --> 28:44.089
Let me
see what I can do.

28:44.125 --> 28:45.864
Beautiful.
Thanks, man.

29:00.840 --> 29:03.280
So, Grace...

29:03.316 --> 29:05.943
What do you do?

29:05.978 --> 29:07.909
I'm an HR adviser.

29:07.945 --> 29:09.354
Hm.

29:09.389 --> 29:11.386
What do you do?

29:11.421 --> 29:13.991
Sales.

29:17.958 --> 29:20.626
Where are you from?

29:20.661 --> 29:24.200
Here.

29:24.236 --> 29:26.470
You?

29:26.505 --> 29:29.105
Montreal, originally.

29:49.463 --> 29:51.058
How have you
never had sex?

29:51.093 --> 29:53.028
Shh, tell the whole bar,
why don't you?

29:53.063 --> 29:57.865
Sorry,
this is all I have left.

29:57.901 --> 30:00.565
-Good for you, Grace?
-Sure!

30:03.337 --> 30:06.109
-Thanks, man.
-Yeah.

30:14.918 --> 30:16.352
I don't want
to talk about it.

30:16.387 --> 30:17.423
Okay.

30:17.458 --> 30:19.815
We're not talking about it.

30:31.130 --> 30:32.999
You wouldn't understand.

30:33.035 --> 30:35.798
Try me.
I honestly want to know.

30:38.745 --> 30:42.644
Would you say
most people have...

30:42.679 --> 30:45.909
eaten a hamburger?

30:45.944 --> 30:47.242
Yeah...?

30:47.477 --> 30:50.686
Some people
eat one a week.

30:50.721 --> 30:52.625
Some have two a week.

30:52.660 --> 30:56.954
Exactly,
and some have never had one,

30:56.990 --> 30:59.030
and that's me.

31:03.660 --> 31:06.834
So is it, like...
a religious thing?

31:06.869 --> 31:09.967
Like you don't eat beef?

31:10.003 --> 31:14.680
No, I eat beef.

31:14.715 --> 31:17.845
Maybe you're
more of a salad person.

31:17.880 --> 31:21.351
You prefer, you know...

31:21.386 --> 31:23.616
salads?

31:23.652 --> 31:24.784
No.

31:24.820 --> 31:26.656
I want a burger,

31:26.691 --> 31:30.053
I've just never had...

31:30.089 --> 31:31.997
the full burger.

31:32.032 --> 31:34.426
I just think you need
to do it and get it over with.

31:34.628 --> 31:37.662
What do you think I was
trying to do ten minutes ago?

31:41.908 --> 31:45.303
Obviously,
I can't have just any burger.

31:45.339 --> 31:46.502
Maybe the first
one needs to be--

31:46.537 --> 31:48.471
It doesn't
need to be anything.

31:48.507 --> 31:49.844
Huh!
I don't want my first burger

31:49.880 --> 31:52.443
to be some... mini slider

31:52.479 --> 31:56.948
like the last thing
from the kitchen.

31:56.983 --> 31:59.221
Yeah, okay.

31:59.257 --> 32:01.551
And I'm not having
some greasy drive-through one

32:01.586 --> 32:04.158
after a drunken night
at the club.

32:04.193 --> 32:07.124
Those can sometimes
be pretty great.

32:07.159 --> 32:09.663
Not for my first.

32:11.872 --> 32:13.939
I don't know,
maybe I've waited too long

32:13.975 --> 32:18.343
and now it's too late
to find the right burger.

32:33.625 --> 32:37.889
How old are you?

32:37.924 --> 32:39.999
I'm 27.

32:44.499 --> 32:47.270
-Grace,
you need to have sex.
-Why?

32:47.305 --> 32:50.171
Who made the rule that
you have to do it before 27?

32:50.206 --> 32:51.676
Just because
everyone else does it

32:51.711 --> 32:53.070
doesn't mean we all have to.

32:53.106 --> 32:57.781
You're right.

32:57.816 --> 33:00.778
It's cool you're okay with it.

33:05.484 --> 33:07.719
Well,
I'm not okay with it.

33:12.630 --> 33:13.764
High school?

33:13.800 --> 33:15.167
I went
to an all-girls school.

33:15.402 --> 33:16.726
University?

33:16.829 --> 33:18.763
It was more trouble
than it was worth back then.

33:19.031 --> 33:20.100
How?

33:20.135 --> 33:21.301
In first year,
my roommate,

33:21.336 --> 33:23.001
she would get
into all these flings.

33:23.037 --> 33:24.338
So much drama.

33:24.374 --> 33:26.076
I swear, I spent half
the year in the library

33:26.111 --> 33:27.912
when she was having sex,
and the other half

33:27.948 --> 33:29.211
being her therapist
the next morning.

33:29.413 --> 33:32.080
Well, she's probably
married with seven kids by now.

33:32.149 --> 33:35.750
No, she's having sex
on my couch.

33:35.786 --> 33:40.282
Oh.

33:40.318 --> 33:42.287
Really, though?

33:42.322 --> 33:44.258
Nothing all through university?

33:44.293 --> 33:45.828
Between classes
and taking care of Joni,

33:45.863 --> 33:47.430
it was a full-time job.

33:47.465 --> 33:50.799
Okay, but that was
what, six, seven years ago?

33:50.835 --> 33:53.438
Nothing since then?

33:53.473 --> 33:55.400
Not one guy?

33:55.436 --> 33:56.739
I've dated, Carter,
it's just--

33:56.775 --> 33:58.810
Just what?

33:58.846 --> 34:00.841
I'm an only child.
I'm reserved.

34:00.877 --> 34:02.138
It takes longer.

34:02.173 --> 34:04.109
Come on.

34:04.145 --> 34:05.242
Guys don't like me.

34:05.310 --> 34:06.511
Of course they do.

34:06.780 --> 34:09.546
No, I'm not the girl
who gets picked up at the bar.

34:09.582 --> 34:10.754
Meet someone
somewhere else then.

34:11.023 --> 34:13.686
But I don't.
It never happens for me.

34:16.696 --> 34:18.293
Maybe you're too picky.

34:18.328 --> 34:21.964
-So I lower my
standards?
-No.

34:21.999 --> 34:24.593
But what are your standards?

34:24.628 --> 34:27.873
Can any guy even reach them?

34:27.908 --> 34:32.343
I'm not gonna
settle for just any guy.

34:32.379 --> 34:36.777
Hmm.

34:36.812 --> 34:40.443
What?

34:40.478 --> 34:45.452
I don't know, maybe...

34:45.488 --> 34:48.927
Maybe you think you're
better than everyone?

34:48.962 --> 34:52.164
Maybe that's why
you've never had sex.

35:13.115 --> 35:16.212
What do you do again?

35:16.247 --> 35:18.322
Sales.

35:29.835 --> 35:34.538
So, tonight has been...

35:34.573 --> 35:36.798
Weird.

35:36.834 --> 35:41.144
I was going
to say "unexpected."

35:41.179 --> 35:46.343
Yeah.
I mean, that's what I meant.

35:46.379 --> 35:50.785
Well, I'm that way.

35:50.820 --> 35:53.049
Oh...

35:57.157 --> 36:00.631
Bye, Carter.

36:00.666 --> 36:03.669
Bye, Grace.

36:03.704 --> 36:05.503
Thanks for the drinks.

36:05.538 --> 36:07.338
Sure.

36:25.492 --> 36:27.649
Hey!

36:27.684 --> 36:30.793
Are you still hungry?

36:31.028 --> 36:33.488
How much
older do I look?

36:33.523 --> 36:35.359
-30?
-30?

36:35.395 --> 36:36.866
You think I look 30?

36:36.901 --> 36:38.199
It's a compliment.

36:38.234 --> 36:39.933
Not when
you're 25, it isn't.

36:39.968 --> 36:41.238
Pssh!

36:41.274 --> 36:43.402
At least people don't
think you're a teenager.

36:43.437 --> 36:45.142
When I wear a hoodie and jeans,

36:45.177 --> 36:47.145
I look like
a high school student.

36:47.181 --> 36:49.907
Oh, so that's why
you dress like you're 40?

36:49.943 --> 36:52.578
I work in an office.
I need to look professional.

36:52.613 --> 36:55.112
Yeah,
I bet you fold up your clothes

36:55.147 --> 36:57.914
in neat little piles at night
before you go to bed too.

36:57.950 --> 37:00.057
Well, clearly,
you fling yours across the room

37:00.093 --> 37:02.325
and step on them
the next morning.

37:02.360 --> 37:04.094
My stuff's crammed
into a carry-on all day.

37:04.130 --> 37:05.224
-What's the point?

37:05.259 --> 37:07.459
Hotels have irons.

37:07.494 --> 37:10.133
No.
Who irons a hoodie?

37:10.169 --> 37:11.869
What exactly
do you sell?

37:11.905 --> 37:13.434
Sports equipment.

37:13.469 --> 37:15.631
Helmets, shoulder pads,
wrist guards,

37:15.666 --> 37:18.036
mouthpieces, jockstraps.

37:18.071 --> 37:20.136
-Sweat-absorbent pants are
great.
-Okay, okay!

37:20.171 --> 37:23.580
-They're revolutionary.
-Sorry I asked.

37:23.615 --> 37:26.742
♪

37:26.777 --> 37:28.447
And look, we're here.

37:28.482 --> 37:30.050
Great, I hate walking.

37:33.687 --> 37:37.292
I told you,
guys don't like me.

37:37.327 --> 37:38.392
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

37:40.362 --> 37:41.789
No,
I think we determined

37:41.825 --> 37:42.925
that you don't like guys.

37:42.960 --> 37:46.270
I like guys.
It just rarely happens.

37:46.306 --> 37:48.367
Okay, how about
the first guy you liked, ever?

37:48.402 --> 37:50.674
Can you remember that?

37:50.710 --> 37:52.144
It's dumb.

37:52.179 --> 37:53.669
-I don't think he counts.
-Yes, he does.

37:53.704 --> 37:57.840
Tell me.
What happened?

37:57.876 --> 38:02.615
I was, um,
I dunno, 14, on the bus.

38:02.651 --> 38:04.417
Not a school bus,
just a regular bus.

38:04.452 --> 38:05.954
Wearing
your school uniform?

38:05.990 --> 38:07.391
Yes.

38:07.426 --> 38:09.386
And I was sitting
at the back reading a book.

38:09.421 --> 38:10.995
Jane Austen?

38:11.031 --> 38:12.587
Can I tell
my own story here?

38:12.623 --> 38:15.299
Sorry, go ahead.

38:15.335 --> 38:19.496
So, the bus stops
and all these boys get on,

38:19.531 --> 38:21.733
teenagers my age,

38:21.768 --> 38:23.567
and of course
they head to the back.

38:23.603 --> 38:26.174
I keep my eyes on my book,

38:26.209 --> 38:27.505
but I can hear them all.

38:27.540 --> 38:31.574
Um, then this one boy,

38:31.610 --> 38:34.551
he sits next to me.

38:34.586 --> 38:36.946
And you know when you sit
next to someone on the bus

38:36.982 --> 38:40.559
and your arms touch,
like here to here?

38:40.594 --> 38:41.652
Yeah.

38:41.687 --> 38:43.795
That's what
happened to us.

38:43.830 --> 38:46.422
Our arms touched.

38:47.563 --> 38:49.492
And usually
you move away, you know?

38:49.528 --> 38:51.125
But we didn't.

38:51.161 --> 38:54.538
We just sat there,
side by side, close.

38:56.842 --> 38:58.910
Then what?

38:58.945 --> 39:02.576
Then the
bus stops and...

39:02.611 --> 39:07.349
they all get off,
including the boy.

39:07.385 --> 39:09.086
What do you mean?
What'd you do?

39:09.122 --> 39:11.549
Nothing.
I didn't talk to him.

39:11.585 --> 39:13.218
I didn't even look at him.

39:13.254 --> 39:14.322
Not once?

39:14.358 --> 39:16.453
Not even when he
got off the bus?

39:16.489 --> 39:19.224
No, I just...

39:19.260 --> 39:20.491
I didn't.

39:20.526 --> 39:23.132
I don't know why.

39:23.167 --> 39:24.464
Grace, what the fuck?

39:24.499 --> 39:26.633
I know!
Why did I do that?

39:26.668 --> 39:28.730
Yeah,
the first thing you should do

39:28.766 --> 39:30.306
is make eye contact.

39:30.342 --> 39:32.010
I mean,
if he said something to me

39:32.045 --> 39:33.178
I would have looked at him.

39:33.213 --> 39:34.671
No, you could
have said something.

39:34.706 --> 39:35.971
What was I going to say?

39:36.007 --> 39:38.448
Anything!
"Hi, hello, I like you."

39:38.484 --> 39:41.281
He would have
looked at me like I was crazy.

39:41.316 --> 39:42.777
But you liked him?

39:42.812 --> 39:44.823
I mean, I... I...

39:44.858 --> 39:46.482
No, I don't know.

39:46.517 --> 39:48.457
Okay...

39:48.492 --> 39:52.323
Some guy sat next
to you on the bus.

39:52.358 --> 39:54.163
Yeah.

39:54.198 --> 39:58.332
And you felt something?

39:58.367 --> 40:00.301
Did you or didn't you?

40:00.336 --> 40:02.804
I was 14.
I don't...

40:07.342 --> 40:08.737
-I did.
-Mm-hm.

40:08.772 --> 40:12.412
I felt something.

40:12.447 --> 40:15.954
I bet he liked you too.

40:15.989 --> 40:18.347
-I think he did.
-Mm-hm.

40:21.286 --> 40:25.293
It's funny, I always
thought that was a nice story.

40:25.329 --> 40:27.493
Pfft, but it really isn't!

40:27.528 --> 40:30.202
It's actually kinda sad.

40:30.237 --> 40:32.002
If you would
have just looked at him

40:32.038 --> 40:33.337
and said something,

40:33.372 --> 40:35.232
who knows
what could have happened.

40:43.875 --> 40:45.446
Where is this place?

40:45.481 --> 40:46.912
You're so impatient.

40:46.948 --> 40:49.749
Well, you've tricked me
into doing more walking.

40:49.784 --> 40:51.321
-Oh, we're close!
-I see your ways.

40:51.357 --> 40:53.621
It's a yellow door
with bars on it.

40:53.656 --> 40:55.453
With bars on it?
Where are you taking me?

40:55.489 --> 40:56.824
You'll like it.

40:56.859 --> 40:59.591
I haven't been in a while,
but you'll like it.

40:59.626 --> 41:01.129
Okay, well, it's cold.

41:01.165 --> 41:02.462
This isn't cold.

41:02.497 --> 41:04.467
You're from Montreal.

41:04.502 --> 41:06.466
Well, I haven't
lived there in years.

41:06.501 --> 41:08.136
Where do you live now?

41:08.171 --> 41:09.669
Down south.

41:09.705 --> 41:12.503
Down south,
like South Carolina?

41:12.539 --> 41:14.505
Eh, more south.

41:14.541 --> 41:16.011
South... Dakota?

41:16.046 --> 41:17.279
Mm-mm.

41:17.314 --> 41:19.447
-South... Asia?
-Uh-uh.

41:19.483 --> 41:20.942
South America?
South Africa?

41:20.977 --> 41:23.018
-South-- Korea!
-Ha!

41:23.053 --> 41:24.113
What?

41:24.148 --> 41:26.616
Um. Somewhere
in between all that.

41:26.651 --> 41:29.552
South Sudan?

41:29.587 --> 41:31.124
Florida.

41:31.160 --> 41:32.230
Oh!

41:32.266 --> 41:34.462
-What's that like?
-Mm, it's humid.

41:34.497 --> 41:36.200
-Hmm!
-Uh, Mickey Mouse.

41:36.235 --> 41:37.429
-Retirement homes.
-Yes.

41:37.465 --> 41:39.199
Uh, alligators.

41:39.234 --> 41:40.303
Oranges.

41:40.339 --> 41:41.997
-Palm trees, beaches.
-Miami.

41:42.033 --> 41:44.640
Yeah, all that.
All that stuff.

41:44.675 --> 41:47.670
So, is Florida
a big sports equipment hub

Why do you like
sitting at the bar?

43:32.078 --> 43:34.244
It's
comfortable, casual,

43:34.279 --> 43:36.613
easier to get close
to a girl when I'm out.

43:36.649 --> 43:38.214
Original.

43:38.249 --> 43:40.124
I'm at a bar.
Where else would I sit?

43:40.159 --> 43:43.627
At a table.
The chairs are more comfortable.
My feet touch the ground.

43:43.663 --> 43:45.790
You can talk and have
an actual conversation

43:45.825 --> 43:47.360
about something real.

43:47.395 --> 43:48.496
What?

43:48.532 --> 43:50.164
It's too loud at the bar.

43:50.200 --> 43:52.370
I don't want to have to compete
with the music and the people.

43:52.406 --> 43:54.134
Well, that's
when you get closer.

43:54.169 --> 43:56.665
You can lean in, whisper
in her ear, smell her perfume.

43:56.700 --> 44:00.211
I could read her body language
better when I'm at the bar.

44:00.246 --> 44:03.177
So it's all about you?

44:03.213 --> 44:04.739
No.

44:05.041 --> 44:06.713
I like the table.

44:06.748 --> 44:08.212
You can look someone in the eye.

44:08.248 --> 44:11.752
Hmm, but there's
a physical barrier between us.

44:11.788 --> 44:13.248
When we sit across
from each other,

44:13.284 --> 44:15.054
I feel like
I'm in an interview.

44:15.089 --> 44:17.094
At the bar, I have
to keep turning my head.

44:17.130 --> 44:19.857
It's annoying.

44:19.892 --> 44:24.134
Okay, what's going on?

44:24.169 --> 44:28.865
You tell me.

44:28.900 --> 44:31.538

But I... I understand.

46:05.735 --> 46:09.467
There's
nothing I can do.

46:12.838 --> 46:15.640
Let's go.

46:15.675 --> 46:17.940
Where?

46:17.976 --> 46:20.819
Just come on.

46:25.421 --> 46:28.486
Come on!

46:39.466 --> 46:41.300
<i> The rink's</i>
<i>closing in 15 minutes.</i>

46:41.336 --> 46:43.298
<i>Please return your rentals</i>
<i>to the front desk.</i>

46:43.333 --> 46:45.033
<i>Rentals to the front desk.</i>

46:45.069 --> 46:46.369
Come on, Carter.

46:46.404 --> 46:49.139
-Hurry up!
-This is stupid.

46:49.174 --> 46:52.276
So what you
do is stupid?

46:52.312 --> 46:54.045
What I do
isn't figure skating

46:54.080 --> 46:55.444
in the middle of the night.

46:55.479 --> 46:57.114
Yeah,
figure skating is ten times

46:57.149 --> 46:58.882
more entertaining than hockey.

46:58.918 --> 47:00.219
Really?

47:00.255 --> 47:02.417
A bunch of dudes
trying to get a piece of rubber

47:02.453 --> 47:05.991
into a net?
What's the big deal?

47:06.026 --> 47:08.465
You're
gonna hurt yourself.

47:08.500 --> 47:09.825
Are you coming or not?

47:09.861 --> 47:13.294
Not.

47:13.329 --> 47:15.837
Whoa, whoa...
Ah!

47:15.872 --> 47:17.473
Do you even
know how to skate?

47:17.575 --> 47:20.071
Whoa, oh my God.
Whoa...

47:20.106 --> 47:23.037
-Grace?
-Whoa, oh my God.

47:23.072 --> 47:26.876
Whoa!

47:26.911 --> 47:28.679
Gotcha.

47:28.715 --> 47:29.685
Bye.

47:29.720 --> 47:31.579
Oh,
you're like the only guy

47:31.614 --> 47:33.122
who doesn't want
to talk about hockey.

47:33.158 --> 47:36.921
Everywhere else, men won't
shut up about it, but you...

47:36.956 --> 47:39.088
Come on, tell me.

47:39.124 --> 47:41.023

How'd you get into it?

48:06.852 --> 48:09.557
My dad.

48:09.593 --> 48:12.492
He loved hockey.

48:12.527 --> 48:16.300
Mom didn't tell me much about
him, she just told me that.

48:16.336 --> 48:18.963
He loved hockey.

48:18.999 --> 48:21.472
You didn't know him?

48:21.507 --> 48:26.401
He left when I was two.

When I was a kid, I thought,

"Maybe if I play and get really
good and make it to the pros,

48:33.553 --> 48:37.249

48:37.284 --> 48:41.258
You know, "Maybe I meet him."

48:41.293 --> 48:45.724
Did you?

48:45.759 --> 48:48.065
Nope.

48:53.372 --> 48:55.033

You didn't answer my question.

49:24.067 --> 49:27.436
What the big deal
about hockey is?

49:27.471 --> 49:29.472
I dunno.

49:29.508 --> 49:32.875
I just love it.

49:32.911 --> 49:37.012
I'm an HR adviser.

49:37.047 --> 49:39.580

beyond the scope of HR.

49:39.749 --> 49:44.251
You don't know HR.

break this to you but, uh,

Let me get you a chair.

50:59.492 --> 51:01.096
We can start with
a DISC assessment.

51:01.131 --> 51:03.459
Myers-Briggs is ideal
but too long.

51:03.494 --> 51:05.261
DISC is short but reliable.

51:05.296 --> 51:07.768
We just need to--

51:07.870 --> 51:09.740
Get out of there!

51:09.775 --> 51:11.073
Look at this view!

51:11.108 --> 51:13.309
No,
you can't be in there!

51:13.345 --> 51:14.745
-Why not?
-That's my boss's
office.

51:14.780 --> 51:15.974
Oh, he's not here.

51:16.009 --> 51:17.242
She.

51:17.277 --> 51:19.249
She's not here, either.

51:22.215 --> 51:25.314
Oh--

51:25.350 --> 51:26.921
You can't sit there!

51:26.957 --> 51:28.223
Well, I just did.

51:28.258 --> 51:29.594
Do you want me
to help you or not?

51:29.629 --> 51:31.055
Yeah, help me.

51:33.323 --> 51:35.631
Uh, hello.

51:35.666 --> 51:36.962
Ugh!

51:36.998 --> 51:39.236
Okay, get off!

51:50.482 --> 51:52.174
What?

51:52.209 --> 51:53.849
Try it.

51:53.884 --> 51:55.945
You know you want to.

52:17.910 --> 52:19.904
-Interesting.
-What?

52:19.939 --> 52:22.841
Your position sounds like
it has very dominant qualities,

52:22.876 --> 52:26.006
but according to this assessment
your behavioural tendencies

52:26.042 --> 52:28.719
lean more towards
private analytical traits.

52:28.755 --> 52:31.621
Accuracy is your strength.

52:31.656 --> 52:32.889
Meaning...?

52:33.191 --> 52:34.892
Are you sure you're
supposed to play centre?

52:34.928 --> 52:36.958
Yes,
I'm supposed to play centre.

52:36.994 --> 52:38.227
I've always played centre.

52:38.262 --> 52:39.624
Okay, I'm just
interpreting the results.

52:39.660 --> 52:42.098
Okay, well, let's
interpret something else.

52:42.133 --> 52:43.691
Let's go back
to your options.

52:43.727 --> 52:45.698
-What are they?

52:45.733 --> 52:49.139
One, you get picked by another
team and stay in the NHL

52:49.174 --> 52:52.171
or, two, you get sent
down for the minors

52:52.206 --> 52:53.968
and play for Syracuse.

52:54.003 --> 52:55.746
Now, both options
have their advantages--

52:55.781 --> 52:57.548
There's a third option.

52:57.584 --> 52:59.011
Oh, okay, great.

52:59.046 --> 53:02.046
What is it?

53:02.081 --> 53:04.082
I quit.

53:04.117 --> 53:06.451
You'd quit?

53:06.486 --> 53:07.658
You asked
for all the options.

53:07.693 --> 53:10.089
That's an option.

53:10.124 --> 53:12.156
No, you're right.

53:12.191 --> 53:15.296
Three, quit.

53:15.332 --> 53:17.200
So what's your least
desirable option,

53:17.235 --> 53:20.299
the one you absolutely
do not want to do?

53:20.334 --> 53:22.631
I think
it's pretty obvious.

53:22.667 --> 53:24.401
Right,
number two, Syracuse.

53:25.672 --> 53:26.975
Let's talk about it
in general terms.

53:27.010 --> 53:28.177
I really don't want to.

53:28.212 --> 53:29.946
What does
going to Syracuse entail?

53:29.981 --> 53:32.277
Less money?
Less prestige?

53:32.312 --> 53:33.584
Less high-level play?

53:33.620 --> 53:36.281
Less everything.

53:36.316 --> 53:37.949
Oh, I forgot something.

53:37.985 --> 53:40.825
Why do you think you're being
sent down in the first place?

53:40.860 --> 53:43.626
Because
they think I suck.

53:43.661 --> 53:45.395
Do you?

53:51.066 --> 53:53.194
-Carter.
-Grace.

54:13.357 --> 54:17.153
I guess maybe
I'm not working hard enough.

54:17.189 --> 54:19.963
Why?

54:19.999 --> 54:23.526
We travel a lot.
It's stressful.

54:23.562 --> 54:27.300
Can't always stay focused.

54:27.335 --> 54:28.829
But everyone's
travelling.

54:28.864 --> 54:31.039
Not all players get sent down.

54:31.075 --> 54:32.707
And you're taken care of.

54:32.742 --> 54:34.911
I mean, how stressful is it
to stay in five-star hotels

54:34.946 --> 54:36.579
and fly private jets?

54:36.615 --> 54:40.284
You don't even have a family.
You have none of those stresses.

54:40.320 --> 54:41.877
I thought this was
supposed to make me feel better.

54:41.912 --> 54:47.217
Why...
Why has your game deteriorated?

54:47.253 --> 54:48.289
Pressure.

54:48.325 --> 54:49.960
Where is
the pressure coming from?

54:49.995 --> 54:53.191
-Everyone.
-Name them, who?

54:55.198 --> 54:59.164
My coach, my team, the fans.

54:59.200 --> 55:02.969
I don't know.

55:03.005 --> 55:05.910
Your dad?

55:05.945 --> 55:07.674
I don't
even know my dad.

55:07.710 --> 55:10.445
But he's the reason
you started playing, right?

55:10.648 --> 55:13.541
You feel like you have to
live up to his expectations?

55:13.577 --> 55:15.276
That's pressure.

55:15.311 --> 55:17.919
You play and he doesn't show up,
so you play harder.

55:17.955 --> 55:19.079
You keep going.

55:19.114 --> 55:23.792
You make it to the NHL,
but where is he?

55:23.827 --> 55:26.359
Nowhere.

55:26.395 --> 55:28.023
No matter
how good you are,

55:28.058 --> 55:32.266
he never shows up,
you'll never meet him.

55:32.302 --> 55:34.836
That's why
I stopped trying.

55:34.871 --> 55:39.041
Yeah.

55:39.076 --> 55:42.072
I don't know.

55:56.492 --> 55:59.854
You did something
so few people do.

55:59.889 --> 56:01.198
You found something you love

56:01.233 --> 56:04.700
and played it
to the highest level.

56:04.735 --> 56:10.138
Do you know how many people
dream of doing a tenth of that?

56:10.173 --> 56:13.141
But, Carter, you did.

56:13.176 --> 56:16.246
You went all the way,

56:16.281 --> 56:20.710
and all you have to do
is do it again,

56:20.745 --> 56:23.949
but don't do it for anyone else.

56:27.355 --> 56:30.494
Do it for yourself.

56:37.694 --> 56:41.496
This suits you.

56:41.531 --> 56:43.067
What?

56:46.912 --> 56:49.536
This.
Here.

56:49.572 --> 56:52.607
You.

56:52.643 --> 56:55.453
It suits you.

57:06.526 --> 57:09.929
I should put this back.

57:25.280 --> 57:27.777
-Whoa.
-What?

57:27.812 --> 57:29.447
A message from my
agent.

57:29.483 --> 57:31.755
Chicago is circling.

57:31.791 --> 57:33.455
That good?

57:33.490 --> 57:35.817
Yeah, it means
they might want me.

57:35.853 --> 57:39.260
I'll know in a few hours.

57:39.295 --> 57:42.665
-That's great.
-Yeah.

57:44.962 --> 57:47.096
Okay, can we get
out of here now?

57:47.131 --> 57:50.805
Yeah, Joni's sexathon
must be over by now.

58:25.869 --> 58:27.905
-Roshan!
-Grace!

58:27.940 --> 58:29.578
What are you--
what are you doing here?

58:29.614 --> 58:31.446
Uh, last call's over,
the office was closed,

58:31.481 --> 58:33.113
-so we thought...
-Work party!

58:34.418 --> 58:37.648
Um, you guys
can't party here.

58:37.683 --> 58:40.752
Roshan, you know that.

58:40.788 --> 58:44.159
There's
nowhere else for us to go.

58:44.195 --> 58:45.895
I have a hotel room.

58:45.931 --> 58:47.122
Full bar.

58:47.157 --> 58:48.965
-Everything's paid for.
-Yes!

58:49.000 --> 58:51.431
Yes! Roshan?

58:51.467 --> 58:53.629
I'd... be into that idea.

Stop fighting it.
He likes you too.

Oh my God, there's karaoke mics!

59:31.534 --> 59:33.575
-No way!
-There's karaoke
mics.

Good morning.
Welcome to the Dalton--

1:22:01.685 --> 1:22:03.722
I need your help!
I'm looking for Carter Stone.

1:22:03.757 --> 1:22:04.958
Is he still here?

1:22:05.161 --> 1:22:07.323
I... I'm sorry, I can't
reveal guest information.

1:22:07.358 --> 1:22:09.657
No, I know him.
He was in the, um...

1:22:09.692 --> 1:22:11.660
Wellington Suite.
We spent the night together.

1:22:12.965 --> 1:22:14.526
It's not what you think.

1:22:14.562 --> 1:22:15.969
Actually, it is what you
think...

1:22:16.004 --> 1:22:17.138
I just need to
tell him something.

1:22:17.540 --> 1:22:18.904
Is he still here?

1:22:18.939 --> 1:22:23.406
He checked out.
I'm sorry.

1:22:23.442 --> 1:22:28.350
But if it helps,
we sent his gear to the airport.

1:22:28.386 --> 1:22:29.914
Right, Pearson.

1:22:29.949 --> 1:22:32.646
No, the Island Airport.

1:22:32.681 --> 1:22:36.190
But you can't fly to
L.A. from the Island.

1:22:38.928 --> 1:22:43.659
Island Airport,
as fast as you can.

1:22:49.671 --> 1:22:53.006
Yup, I got it.

1:22:53.042 --> 1:22:56.377
I'll be in Syracuse
in a couple hours.

1:22:56.412 --> 1:22:58.547
Mm-hm.

1:22:58.583 --> 1:23:03.881
Yeah, I'll call you then.

1:23:03.916 --> 1:23:05.879
Dani, I gotta go.

1:23:11.452 --> 1:23:12.957
What are you doing here?

1:23:12.992 --> 1:23:15.262
Why didn't you tell me?

1:23:18.166 --> 1:23:21.361
Didn't want to
make a big deal out of it.

1:23:21.396 --> 1:23:24.073
It's the biggest deal.

1:23:28.042 --> 1:23:30.739
Aw, Grace,
why'd you come here?

1:23:38.249 --> 1:23:41.123
Last night, it wasn't just...

1:23:54.396 --> 1:23:57.802
I like you, Carter.

1:23:57.837 --> 1:24:00.738
I like you.

1:24:02.339 --> 1:24:05.413
I just wanted you to know that.

1:24:11.322 --> 1:24:14.387
And...

1:24:18.288 --> 1:24:22.529
Goodbye?
