I'm so happy for you,

Oh, right.
We scream, she grows.

Don't you worry about them.

09:15.120 --> 09:17.500
And Raph ain't afraid
of bullies!

09:17.568 --> 09:19.293
- We'll see about that.

09:19.362 --> 09:20.844
[grunts]

09:20.913 --> 09:23.120
- Uh-oh.
- Hiyah!

09:23.189 --> 09:25.327
- [grunts]

09:25.396 --> 09:27.086
[growls]

09:27.155 --> 09:28.258
- Oh!

09:28.327 --> 09:29.672
[grunts]

09:29.741 --> 09:33.362
[laughs maniacally]

09:33.431 --> 09:36.431
- [screams]

09:36.500 --> 09:37.603
[grunts]

09:37.672 --> 09:40.913
- [laughing]
Look at you, Red!

09:40.982 --> 09:44.431
- No! No giggles.
I hate giggles.

09:44.500 --> 09:46.534
Stop giggling!

09:46.603 --> 09:48.017
- [laughs]

09:48.086 --> 09:50.155
No one roughs up my family

09:50.224 --> 09:52.293
or interrupts my TV regimen.

09:52.362 --> 09:56.327
You made a powerful enemy,
rabbit.

09:56.396 --> 09:57.982
- [grunts]

09:58.051 --> 10:01.051
[both grunting]

10:02.534 --> 10:04.086
- Hiyah!

10:04.155 --> 10:06.844
Hiyah!
- [grunts]

10:06.913 --> 10:07.879
- Hiyah!
- [groans]

10:07.948 --> 10:08.948
- [shouts]

10:09.017 --> 10:11.500
- Oh--ow!
- Ow! [spits]

10:11.568 --> 10:12.844
Why?

10:12.913 --> 10:15.568
- Ooh, someone has
a case of cottonmouth.

10:15.637 --> 10:17.017
[laughing]

10:17.086 --> 10:19.844
[air hissing]
- [groaning]

10:19.913 --> 10:22.396
- Wait. She's getting smaller.

10:22.465 --> 10:25.465
- Stop! You're just like
those kids on my show.

10:25.534 --> 10:28.706
Their giggles steal my power.
[screams]

10:28.775 --> 10:30.500
[all grunting]

10:30.568 --> 10:33.534
- Keep at it, Pops.
The laughing shrinks her.

10:33.603 --> 10:37.258
- How can I laugh when that
bunny is so ferocious?

10:37.327 --> 10:40.189
[laughing]

10:40.258 --> 10:42.775
I'm sorry, I couldn't say
that with a straight face.

10:42.844 --> 10:44.982
[laughs]
- Hiy--

10:45.051 --> 10:46.741
- Ha!
- [groans]

10:46.810 --> 10:49.672
Oof!
[grunts, squeaks]

10:49.741 --> 10:52.017
Oh, just don't put me
back in my trunk

10:52.086 --> 10:54.879
and send me back to the kids!

10:54.948 --> 10:57.637
- [chuckles] Hey,
that's a great idea.

10:57.706 --> 11:00.775
So great, I wanna scream
about how great it is.

11:00.844 --> 11:02.568
But I won't.

11:03.327 --> 11:04.948
So long, pal!

11:05.017 --> 11:06.775
Let's be friends for never.

11:06.844 --> 11:08.879
[both laugh]
- Good one.

11:08.948 --> 11:11.017
- "For never."
- Guys?

11:11.086 --> 11:13.775
- Anybody there?
- Can somebody untie us?

11:13.844 --> 11:15.500
- I'm afraid of togetherness.

11:15.568 --> 11:18.879
- [chuckles] We will
get right to that.

11:18.948 --> 11:21.258
[suppresses laughter]
Eventually.

11:21.327 --> 11:23.844
[laughs]
