03:42.040 --> 03:44.372
-So you're going to Washington?
-Yes, ma'am.

03:44.443 --> 03:47.037
My son is sick in a hospital there.

03:47.446 --> 03:50.142
This will be an anxious Christmas for you.

03:50.949 --> 03:53.975
l think this one will do. Let's try this.

03:55.754 --> 03:58.120
-ls it your only son?
-No, ma'am.

03:58.257 --> 04:02.455
l had four, but two were killed
and one is a prisoner.

04:04.596 --> 04:07.064
You've done a great deal
for your country, sir.

04:07.232 --> 04:12.329
Not a mite more than l ought, ma'am.
l'd go myself if l was any use.

04:13.438 --> 04:15.565
Thank you for the overcoat.

04:16.975 --> 04:18.567
Wait a minute.

04:19.444 --> 04:21.673
l hope you find him better.

04:22.381 --> 04:24.941
Thank you, ma'am. God bless you.

04:26.652 --> 04:29.587
Merry Christmas.

04:30.022 --> 04:31.614
Merry Christmas.

04:34.526 --> 04:37.984
Mrs. March,
will you sign this so l can get it off?

04:41.099 --> 04:42.760
Why, what's the matter?

04:44.069 --> 04:46.594
When l see things like that poor old man...

04:47.940 --> 04:50.841
...it makes me ashamed
to think how little l do.

04:51.343 --> 04:55.609
But, my dear, you're doing all you can here,
and your husband is there.

04:55.747 --> 04:57.237
Yes, l know.

04:57.849 --> 05:01.216
His last son is lying ill, miles away...

05:01.653 --> 05:04.918
...waiting to say goodbye to him,
forever perhaps...

05:05.857 --> 05:08.792
...while l have my four girls to comfort me.

05:08.927 --> 05:11.896
And a real comfort they are, too,
aren't they?

05:12.564 --> 05:14.896
l couldn't bear it without them.

05:16.268 --> 05:18.668
-Meg and Jo are working, you know?
-Yes?

05:18.737 --> 05:20.364
Meg is a nursery governess.

05:21.373 --> 05:23.432
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

05:23.508 --> 05:24.873
Merry Christmas.

05:26.144 --> 05:29.045
Remember, Lily,
Santa Claus is watching you.

05:29.815 --> 05:30.713
Come on, Tony.

05:32.551 --> 05:35.884
''We know as well,
what are the baneful fruits of selfishness...

05:35.954 --> 05:40.118
''...and self-indulgence.
Bad habits take root with fearful rapidity...

05:40.192 --> 05:42.683
''...even in the richest natures.

05:43.428 --> 05:44.520
''They grow...

05:45.430 --> 05:47.660
''...and ripen and bear their fruit...

05:48.233 --> 05:50.701
''...like southern vines and weeds...

05:52.971 --> 05:54.131
''...almost...

05:54.973 --> 05:57.965
''...in a single day and night.

05:59.011 --> 06:04.313
''Crush them, pluck them out pitilessly
from their very first appearance...

06:05.317 --> 06:07.444
''...and do not weary...

06:07.519 --> 06:10.784
''...of the labor of plucking them out...

06:11.323 --> 06:14.759
''...again and again.''

06:19.131 --> 06:20.826
Goodbye, goodbye!

06:20.899 --> 06:24.335
Hold your tongue,
you disrespectful old bird!

06:25.304 --> 06:26.931
Go on, Josephine.

06:34.546 --> 06:35.911
Josephine!

06:45.991 --> 06:47.686
Where are you off to, Miss?

06:48.126 --> 06:49.593
l didn't think you'd mind.

06:49.661 --> 06:53.188
lt was nearly time to leave
and the girls said they'd be home early...

06:53.265 --> 06:55.529
...so we could rehearse my play
for Christmas.

06:55.600 --> 06:58.034
Never a thought about my Christmas.

06:58.103 --> 07:02.506
Flying off without a word of cheer
or greeting for your poor old aunt.

07:02.574 --> 07:04.303
l'm sorry, Aunt March.

07:04.710 --> 07:07.372
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

07:09.114 --> 07:10.206
Here.

07:16.655 --> 07:19.749
lt's a dollar for each. Well, take them.

07:19.925 --> 07:21.187
Thank you, Aunty.

07:21.259 --> 07:25.161
Never mind thanking me.
Just spend it wisely, that's all l ask.

07:25.831 --> 07:29.824
Although it's more than l can expect
when you're so much like your father...

07:30.302 --> 07:34.568
...waltzing off to war and letting
other folks look after his family.

07:34.706 --> 07:38.301
There's nobody looking after us.
And we don't ask favors from anybody.

07:38.377 --> 07:41.904
l'm very proud of Father
and you should be, too.

07:42.247 --> 07:45.683
-Don't you be impertinent, Miss.
-l'm sorry, Aunty.

07:46.084 --> 07:49.679
lt isn't preachers that are going
to win this war. lt's fighters!

07:49.988 --> 07:51.080
Yes, Aunty.

07:51.423 --> 07:53.789
-Can l go, now?
-Yeah, go on.

07:53.859 --> 07:56.191
-Did you clean Polly's cage today?
-Yes, Aunty.

07:56.261 --> 07:59.560
Did you wash those teacups
and put them away carefully?

07:59.698 --> 08:00.790
Yes, Aunty.

08:00.866 --> 08:02.925
-You didn't break any?
-No, Aunty.

08:03.001 --> 08:05.526
-What about the teaspoons?
-l polished them.

08:05.604 --> 08:07.469
Yes. Very well then.

08:09.207 --> 08:11.607
Wait, just a minute. Come back here.

08:14.679 --> 08:17.580
Look at this. You haven't dusted properly.

08:17.682 --> 08:21.982
l want this stair rail dusted and polished
before you leave here.

08:22.821 --> 08:23.947
Yes, Aunty.

08:52.250 --> 08:53.615
Higher.

09:13.605 --> 09:15.436
Thank you very much, ladies.

09:15.507 --> 09:17.941
And now l wish you all
a very merry Christmas.

09:18.109 --> 09:19.701
Merry Christmas!

09:20.412 --> 09:22.243
School is dismissed.

09:33.692 --> 09:37.355
Amy March! You may close the door.

09:43.368 --> 09:45.427
That'll teach her not to cut up didoes.

09:45.504 --> 09:48.996
-lt serves that stuck-up Amy March right.
-What's he going to do to her?

09:49.674 --> 09:54.338
l can see there's nothing for me to do
but to stop by and show your mother...

09:55.347 --> 10:00.717
...how instead of doing your sums,
you cover your slate with sketches.

10:03.755 --> 10:06.553
And most uncomplimentary sketches.

10:10.629 --> 10:15.032
Please, Mr. Davis, l'll never do it again, sir.

10:16.701 --> 10:19.169
And she'd be so disappointed in me.

10:21.072 --> 10:22.266
Please.

10:23.141 --> 10:24.005
Please.

10:24.075 --> 10:26.566
Well, l should hate to spoil her Christmas...

10:27.012 --> 10:30.470
...and for that reason alone, young lady,
l shall overlook it.

10:30.549 --> 10:32.380
Thank you, Mr. Davis!

10:33.018 --> 10:34.383
You may go.

10:34.886 --> 10:39.016
Thank you, Mr. Davis.
Thank you very much indeed.

10:39.658 --> 10:40.716
Thank you, sir.

10:42.260 --> 10:43.249
Here she is.

10:43.595 --> 10:46.063
-What did he do?
-What did he say?

10:46.331 --> 10:49.095
Come on, tell us. What happened?

10:49.334 --> 10:53.395
l just said that if l ever told my mother
the way he treated me...

10:53.471 --> 10:55.905
...she'd take me out of his old school.

10:56.308 --> 10:58.469
She's never been ''reconciliated'' anyway...

10:58.543 --> 11:02.570
...since my father lost his money
and she's had to suffer the ''degaridation''...

11:02.647 --> 11:05.480
...of me being thrown in
with a lot of ill-mannered girls...

11:05.550 --> 11:08.348
...who stick their noses
in refined people's business.

11:39.951 --> 11:44.047
Little tiny pussy, l'll tell you a long story.

11:45.056 --> 11:47.217
-Hannah, is it teatime?
-Yes.

11:47.592 --> 11:49.617
-l'll set the table.
-Thank you, Beth.

11:49.694 --> 11:53.528
lt'll be a help to me
'cause my bread's raised.

11:56.201 --> 11:57.964
The girls are getting home early.

11:58.036 --> 12:00.504
-Are they coming?
-Just passing the Laurence house.

12:04.075 --> 12:08.034
-Christopher Columbus!
-Jo, don't use such dreadful expressions.

12:08.346 --> 12:10.576
Here comes old Mr. Laurence.
What if he heard you?

12:10.649 --> 12:13.777
l don't care. l like good strong words
that mean something.

12:13.852 --> 12:16.616
Oh, bother.
Now we're going to have to speak to him.

12:18.156 --> 12:19.646
How do?

12:21.326 --> 12:24.261
lt makes my knees chatter
just to look at him.

12:24.462 --> 12:29.365
l feel sorry for that poor boy, shut up alone
with such an ogre for a grandfather.

12:29.701 --> 12:31.669
-Look, there he is.
-Where?

12:33.705 --> 12:35.935
Don't point, Jo.
He'll think you're waving at him.

12:36.041 --> 12:38.771
He's gone anyway. Well, what if he does?

12:39.678 --> 12:41.509
Jo! Come along, Amy.

12:56.528 --> 12:58.860
-How's my Beth?
-lt's cold outside!

12:58.930 --> 13:01.296
Jo just did the most terrible thing.

13:01.366 --> 13:02.924
Beth, come over here.

13:06.137 --> 13:08.002
-He waved at us.
-ls tea ready yet?

13:09.674 --> 13:11.471
Merry Christmas from Aunt March.

13:15.046 --> 13:17.037
-For me?
-Yes, darling, for you.

13:17.248 --> 13:18.340
We got one, too.

13:18.416 --> 13:21.078
-What are you going to do with it, dear?
-l don't know.

13:21.152 --> 13:23.882
Marmee said we ought not
to spend money for pleasure...

13:23.955 --> 13:26.253
...when our men are suffering so
in the Army.

13:26.491 --> 13:30.951
A dollar couldn't do the Army much good,
so l'm going to buy <i>Undine and Sintram</i>.

13:32.063 --> 13:33.724
l've wanted it long enough.

13:33.798 --> 13:36.596
l'm sure Marmee would approve
if l got some new gloves.

13:36.668 --> 13:39.330
l've darned my old ones
until l can hardly get them on.

13:39.404 --> 13:42.999
She always says a real lady is known
by her neat gloves and boots.

13:43.241 --> 13:48.144
l shall get a nice box of Faber's
drawing pencils. l really need them.

13:49.614 --> 13:52.777
Then l'd like to spend mine
for some new music...

13:53.451 --> 13:55.919
...that is,
if you don't think Marmee would mind.

13:56.187 --> 13:59.020
Let's each buy what we want
and have a little fun.

14:00.658 --> 14:02.387
l'm sure we work hard enough.

14:03.061 --> 14:06.656
l know l do.
lt's not the work l mind so much.

14:07.799 --> 14:10.324
lt's having to tell Flo King
how pretty she looks...

14:10.401 --> 14:12.699
...in things l know would look
as well on me.

14:12.837 --> 14:16.568
What would you do if you were shut up
all day with an old crosspatch...

14:16.641 --> 14:18.905
...who flies off the handle
every move you make?

14:18.977 --> 14:21.070
Jo, don't use slang.

14:22.046 --> 14:24.844
Besides, don't forget
she gave us the dollar.

14:25.383 --> 14:27.749
l'm sure neither of you suffer as l do.

14:28.119 --> 14:31.054
You don't have to go
to that nasty old Davis' school...

14:31.122 --> 14:35.286
...with impertinent girls who laugh at you
and ''label'' your father 'cause he isn't rich.

14:35.360 --> 14:38.852
''Libel.'' Don't say ''label''
as if Papa were a pickle bottle.

14:39.164 --> 14:43.225
l know what l mean
and you needn't be ''statirical'' about it.

14:43.635 --> 14:46.934
lt's proper to use good words
and improve your ''vocabilary.''

14:48.039 --> 14:49.131
Aren't we elegant?

14:49.207 --> 14:51.402
You'd never be thought so with your slang.

14:51.476 --> 14:53.535
l hope not. l don't want to be elegant.

14:53.611 --> 14:56.239
-You needn't whistle like a boy.
-That's why l do it.

14:56.981 --> 15:00.974
-l detest rude, unladylike girls.
-And l hate affected, niminy-piminy chicks.

15:01.519 --> 15:04.579
Birds in their little nests agree.

15:15.066 --> 15:16.931
Really, you're both to blame.

15:17.202 --> 15:20.968
You're old enough to leave off boyish tricks
and behave better, Josephine.

15:21.039 --> 15:25.703
Now you are so tall and turn up your hair,
you must remember you're a young lady.

15:25.777 --> 15:30.373
No, l'm not. And if turning up my hair
makes me so, l'll wear it down till l'm 100.

15:30.448 --> 15:31.608
Jo!

15:33.451 --> 15:36.909
As for you, Amy, your absurd words
are as bad as Jo's slang.

15:36.988 --> 15:40.185
Your airs are funny now,
but you'll grow into an affected goose...

15:40.325 --> 15:42.020
...unless you take care.

15:42.393 --> 15:47.456
lf Jo is a tomboy and Amy's a goose,
what am l, please?

15:49.367 --> 15:51.301
You're a dear and nothing else.

15:51.502 --> 15:55.632
We're three ungrateful wretches
who don't deserve you.

15:56.474 --> 15:59.807
Wait until l become a famous author
and make my fortune.

15:59.878 --> 16:03.041
Then we'll all ride in fine carriages,
dressed like Flo King...

16:03.114 --> 16:07.244
...snubbing Amy's friends and telling
Aunt March to go to the dickens.

16:07.318 --> 16:08.376
Let's rehearse.

16:08.620 --> 16:13.648
We'll start with the fainting scene.
You're as stiff as a poker in that, Amy.

16:13.725 --> 16:17.126
Well, l can't help it.
l've never seen anyone faint...

16:17.195 --> 16:21.188
...and l don't intend to make myself
black-and-blue tumbling as flat as you do.

16:21.266 --> 16:23.461
lt's easy if you'll only watch me. Come on.

16:23.534 --> 16:27.402
-lf l can drop gracefully, l'll....
-Now, when l come in...

16:27.572 --> 16:31.565
...you'll see the horrible look in my eyes
and you shrink back trembling.

16:31.910 --> 16:32.899
Go ahead.

16:38.950 --> 16:41.043
Get into the mood, Amy.

16:41.119 --> 16:45.249
Now, when l start toward you,
with wicked intentions....

16:49.060 --> 16:51.358
Oh, Amy, you...

16:53.364 --> 16:56.822
...draw back in horror,
covering your eyes with your hands.

16:57.702 --> 17:00.102
''Roderigo, Roderigo!

17:02.040 --> 17:03.667
''Save me, save me! ''

17:10.214 --> 17:12.375
There, now you see? Now, it's easy.

17:12.983 --> 17:14.576
Now, here l come.

17:18.056 --> 17:20.422
''Roderigo, Roderigo!

17:22.359 --> 17:24.487
''Save me, save me! ''

17:35.340 --> 17:38.366
-You were marvelous.
-That was lovely.

17:43.114 --> 17:45.639
Glad to find you so merry, my girls.

17:45.850 --> 17:47.283
-Darling.
-Marmee.

17:48.186 --> 17:50.051
-How is your cold, Meg?
-Much better.

17:50.121 --> 17:52.851
Beth, dear, kiss me, baby.

17:53.691 --> 17:56.421
Thank you, Jo. Thank you, dear.

17:58.730 --> 18:02.257
-You look tired to death, Jo.
-No, Marmee, l'm not tired.

18:02.867 --> 18:05.995
-Your slippers are all ready now.
-That's my Bethie, dearie.

18:06.070 --> 18:07.765
Did you have a hard day, Marmee?

18:07.839 --> 18:10.967
No, very pleasant, dear.
But it's good to be home.

18:11.576 --> 18:13.976
-l have a treat for you.
-A letter from Father?

18:14.112 --> 18:16.307
Three cheers for Father.

18:18.750 --> 18:22.481
''Give them all my dear love and a kiss.

18:23.721 --> 18:26.986
''Tell them l know they will remember
all l said to them:

18:27.625 --> 18:30.423
''That they will be loving children to you...

18:30.495 --> 18:35.091
''...they will do their duty faithfully,
fight their bosom enemies bravely...

18:35.700 --> 18:38.328
''...and conquer themselves so beautifully...

18:38.403 --> 18:42.601
''...that when l come back to them,
l may be fonder and prouder than ever...

18:42.673 --> 18:44.573
''...of my little women.''

18:49.547 --> 18:51.378
l am a selfish girl...

18:53.217 --> 18:57.517
...but l'll truly try to be better
and not waste my time in school...

18:58.723 --> 19:01.851
...so that Father
may not be disappointed in me.

19:04.162 --> 19:09.532
l'll try and be what he loves to call me,
''a little woman''...

19:10.735 --> 19:14.899
...and not be rough and wild,
and do my duty here at home...

19:15.807 --> 19:19.538
...instead of always wanting
to go to war to help Father.

19:20.778 --> 19:24.646
l'm not going to be envious anymore,
if l can help it.

19:37.328 --> 19:39.796
Now, we'll save the rest till after tea...

19:40.431 --> 19:44.800
...for it's such a lovely long letter.
l know everybody must be hungry.

19:52.510 --> 19:55.502
Let's get something for Marmee
with our dollar...

19:55.580 --> 19:58.174
...instead of for ourselves, shall we?

19:58.749 --> 20:01.115
That's like you, Beth. What shall we get?

20:01.752 --> 20:04.949
-l'll get her a nice pair of gloves.
-New slippers, best to be had.

20:05.022 --> 20:06.717
Some handkerchiefs, all hemmed.

20:06.958 --> 20:11.657
A beautiful little bottle of cologne.
She'll like that, and it won't cost much...

20:11.729 --> 20:14.664
...and then l'll have some left over
for my pencils.

20:17.802 --> 20:19.667
l've finished with Asia.

20:19.737 --> 20:21.204
And here is Europe.

20:21.639 --> 20:25.006
-Three stitches and you can have Africa.
-Not too long stitches, dear.

20:25.076 --> 20:27.374
lf you pass me the scissors,
l'll give you America.

20:27.445 --> 20:29.709
There, you see? You did finish it after all.

20:29.780 --> 20:32.078
You wanted to put it off until tomorrow.

20:32.150 --> 20:35.017
But we never should have
if Jo hadn't made a game of it...

20:35.086 --> 20:38.249
...and thought of talking
of the different countries as we worked.

20:38.322 --> 20:39.789
lt was a nice idea, Jo.

20:39.957 --> 20:44.553
Do you remember how you used to play
<i>Pilgrim 's Progress</i> when you were little?

20:44.862 --> 20:49.526
l can see us all now with your ragbags
tied over our backs for burdens.

20:49.600 --> 20:53.468
You have real burdens now,
instead of ragbags.

20:54.305 --> 20:57.672
According to what l heard before tea,
except Beth.

20:57.842 --> 21:00.436
She didn't say. Maybe she hasn't any.

21:00.945 --> 21:02.105
Yes, l have.

21:03.181 --> 21:07.845
Mine is dishes and dusters
and being afraid of people...

21:08.319 --> 21:10.583
...and envying girls with nice pianos.

21:10.655 --> 21:12.418
A piano is a burden.

21:59.537 --> 22:01.505
Good night, my precious.

22:01.806 --> 22:03.535
Good night, Marmee.

22:04.075 --> 22:06.703
-Good night, Jo, my girl.
-Good night, Marmee.

22:06.777 --> 22:09.905
-Good night, darling.
-Good night, my baby.

22:12.650 --> 22:15.346
-Good night, Marmee.
-Good night, Bethie.

22:37.875 --> 22:40.503
-Merry Christmas, Hannah.
-Merry Christmas!

22:40.611 --> 22:41.737
Where's Marmee?

22:41.846 --> 22:44.644
She just went down the street,
but she'll be right back.

22:44.715 --> 22:48.617
She wants you to have your breakfast
when l can get it dished up.

22:49.220 --> 22:50.619
Come round here.

22:51.155 --> 22:52.452
Hide them. Get close.

22:59.497 --> 23:02.466
-Where have you been, Amy?
-What have you been doing?

23:02.667 --> 23:04.191
Don't laugh, Jo.

23:04.302 --> 23:07.863
l only changed the little bottle of cologne...

23:09.173 --> 23:12.631
...for a big one.
l gave all my money to get it.

23:13.110 --> 23:14.372
-Amy.
-Darling.

23:15.680 --> 23:17.705
That was unselfish of you.

23:18.149 --> 23:20.174
You're some pumpkins, Amy.

23:21.485 --> 23:25.182
l felt ashamed, thinking only of myself.

23:25.389 --> 23:27.687
Amy, my prettiest rose.

23:28.726 --> 23:33.129
And l'm so glad,
because mine is the handsomest now.

23:36.400 --> 23:39.267
-Where is Marmee?
-She'll be back any minute. Breakfast!

23:39.337 --> 23:41.897
-Hannah, l'm so hungry.
-Hannah, what is it?

23:42.340 --> 23:44.001
Sausages!

23:45.876 --> 23:47.605
Popovers!

23:48.879 --> 23:50.437
They are my favorites!

23:51.182 --> 23:52.410
Coffee!

23:53.951 --> 23:55.919
Oh, Hannah, you've beat the Dutch.

23:55.986 --> 23:57.920
No need to make such a fuss about it.

23:57.988 --> 24:01.321
l remember when l used to serve it
on your father's table every day.

24:01.392 --> 24:02.324
No?

24:02.693 --> 24:06.424
-Hannah, were we really that rich?
-How was l dressed?

24:06.564 --> 24:09.692
l'd like to tell Jenny Snow
all the pretty clothes l used to wear.

24:09.767 --> 24:11.701
-l can tell her. Diapers!
-Jo!

24:12.236 --> 24:13.134
Two each.

24:13.204 --> 24:16.037
-lsn't this marvelous?
-Look at all the popovers.

24:16.107 --> 24:17.165
She's coming!

24:17.274 --> 24:19.504
Hurry, Beth, strike up.
Amy, open the door.

24:19.577 --> 24:22.603
Come here, Meg. We'll cover these up
and it'll be a surprise.

24:27.651 --> 24:28.982
Enter, Marmee.

24:41.465 --> 24:44.434
-Merry Christmas, Marmee!
-Merry Christmas, my....

24:50.107 --> 24:52.473
Oh, darling!

24:52.676 --> 24:56.043
Oh, Meg, dear! Thank you!

24:56.781 --> 25:01.275
And handkerchiefs from Bethie. Thank you.

25:01.352 --> 25:04.150
Hannah, did you see?

25:04.622 --> 25:07.523
Amy, my precious, thank you!

25:07.992 --> 25:09.653
These are from me.

25:10.194 --> 25:12.219
Jo, my girl.

25:12.296 --> 25:14.821
Thank you, darlings. Thank you.

25:15.966 --> 25:17.433
Oh, my girls.

25:20.571 --> 25:22.698
l can't tell you how happy l am.

25:25.309 --> 25:30.576
Well, l can tell you how hungry l am.
Come on, everyone. Pass me those plates.

25:30.648 --> 25:33.583
-Sit down, Marmee.
-Marmee, look! Sausages.

25:34.018 --> 25:36.077
Wait a minute, girls.

25:36.720 --> 25:39.348
l want to say one word before we begin.

25:39.857 --> 25:43.691
l've just come from a poor woman
with a little newborn baby...

25:44.061 --> 25:49.260
...and six children huddled into one bed
to keep from freezing, for they have no fire.

25:49.867 --> 25:52.199
They are suffering cold and hunger.

25:53.037 --> 25:57.770
My girls, will you give them your breakfast
as a Christmas present?

26:00.344 --> 26:03.211
l'm so glad you came back
before we started.

26:03.747 --> 26:05.078
l knew you would.

26:05.216 --> 26:06.683
May l carry some things?

26:06.750 --> 26:08.911
We shall all go. Take the coffee, Hannah.

26:08.986 --> 26:11.250
-l'll get some firewood.
-l'll take the cream.

26:11.322 --> 26:13.187
l'll take the bread.

26:14.658 --> 26:16.558
l'll take the popovers.

26:21.799 --> 26:23.824
Here we are, Mrs. Hummel.

26:25.870 --> 26:29.806
<i>Gott in Himmel.</i> Good angels come to us.

26:30.608 --> 26:32.769
Funny angels, in hoods and mittens.

26:32.843 --> 26:35.812
Do you want some bread to eat?
Here, l'll give you some bread.

27:17.288 --> 27:19.722
Strange that Roderigo is not here.

27:19.957 --> 27:23.085
His note says ''promptly on the hour.''

27:27.298 --> 27:28.094
''And why....''

27:28.165 --> 27:31.601
And why Black Hugo's castle for the tryst?

27:33.637 --> 27:35.104
l am afraid.

27:35.806 --> 27:37.330
Who comes here?

27:39.043 --> 27:42.410
Your Highness, 'tis Mona the hag.

27:42.913 --> 27:44.881
Black Hugo hath betrayed thee.

27:45.182 --> 27:46.547
l must fly.

27:52.156 --> 27:54.556
Zara will be waiting.

27:56.160 --> 27:57.752
My proud beauty!

27:59.330 --> 28:00.957
She will be mine!

28:03.701 --> 28:06.135
Black Hugo approaches.

28:09.707 --> 28:12.471
Withered crone, begone!

28:24.355 --> 28:26.550
Roderigo, Roderigo!

28:28.459 --> 28:30.086
Save me, save me!

28:37.735 --> 28:41.296
And now to carry out my fell design.

28:47.945 --> 28:49.173
What a fake.

28:49.246 --> 28:52.443
Well, l told you
l wasn't going to make myself--

28:57.354 --> 29:00.619
Have pity. Oh, have pity!

29:00.924 --> 29:03.984
Bring not upon me the worst of shame!

29:04.128 --> 29:08.622
Silence, else you'll rue the day
you spurned Black Hugo's love.

29:09.400 --> 29:14.428
Make thyself ready for the wedding.
l shall return within the quarter.

29:15.305 --> 29:16.670
Ah, me!

29:17.441 --> 29:20.467
Heaven protect the helpless!

29:23.313 --> 29:25.975
Zara ! My beloved!

29:26.083 --> 29:30.179
Roderigo, durst l believe my eyes?

29:33.290 --> 29:37.283
''The pale stars are twinkling

29:38.295 --> 29:42.857
''The fair moon is rising above

29:43.400 --> 29:47.200
''My guitar is tinkling

29:48.138 --> 29:54.839
''But the notes are not sweet
Till they bring me my love''

30:00.784 --> 30:02.411
Courage, my fair.

30:03.420 --> 30:06.412
The good padre waits
at yonder gate with the horses.

30:06.523 --> 30:09.185
See, the ladder. All is arranged.

30:10.627 --> 30:14.586
Liberty! Fly with me.
Fly with me, my love.

30:14.665 --> 30:17.498
l will assist you. l will....

30:23.107 --> 30:25.575
lt's all right, everyone.
Stay where you are.

30:37.921 --> 30:39.616
Young ladies.

30:40.257 --> 30:43.226
Will you all please come in to supper?

30:57.841 --> 31:00.833
Christopher Columbus! What's this?

31:00.911 --> 31:02.276
ls it fairies?

31:02.479 --> 31:04.310
-lt's Santa Claus?
-Mother did it?

31:04.381 --> 31:08.909
-Aunt March had a good fit and sent it?
-All wrong. Mr. Laurence sent it.

31:09.019 --> 31:11.385
-No!
-Who is Mr. Laurence?

31:11.455 --> 31:13.923
The Laurence boy's grandfather.
He lives next door.

31:13.991 --> 31:16.255
He heard what you did
about your breakfast...

31:16.326 --> 31:17.884
...and sent me a nice note...

31:18.061 --> 31:22.225
...saying he hoped l'd allow him to express
his friendly feeling toward my children...

31:22.299 --> 31:25.063
...and send them a few trifles
in honor of the day.

31:28.505 --> 31:30.905
The boy put it into his head, l know he did.

31:30.974 --> 31:34.068
He looks like a capital fellow
and l'm dying to get acquainted.

31:34.144 --> 31:35.805
l'm going to, too.

31:36.079 --> 31:38.240
l wish Father were here.

31:38.715 --> 31:41.650
l'm afraid he isn't having
such a merry Christmas as we are.

32:15.085 --> 32:15.949
Hello.

32:16.086 --> 32:17.280
How do you do?

32:17.788 --> 32:19.619
l wanted to thank you.

32:19.690 --> 32:23.285
We did have such a good time
over your nice Christmas present.

32:24.061 --> 32:25.858
What's the matter? Are you sick?

32:25.929 --> 32:29.296
Just a little cold, but grandfather's
made me stop indoors for a week.

32:29.366 --> 32:30.890
That's too bad.

32:31.501 --> 32:33.492
Can anybody come to see you?

32:33.770 --> 32:34.998
lf they would.

32:35.072 --> 32:37.939
Wait, l'll ask Marmee.
Close the window now.

32:54.825 --> 32:58.022
-How do you do, Miss March?
-How do you do, Mr. Laurence?

32:58.262 --> 33:00.628
Mother was so sorry to hear
that you'd been ill.

33:00.697 --> 33:02.858
My sister, Meg,
sent you some of her blancmange.

33:02.933 --> 33:06.061
lt's soft and will slide down easily
without hurting your throat.

33:06.169 --> 33:06.999
Thank you.

33:07.070 --> 33:10.130
And Beth lent you these until you're well.

33:14.211 --> 33:18.841
l know boys don't like kittens,
but she was so anxious l couldn't refuse.

33:18.916 --> 33:22.374
Maybe they'll help to liven things up.
lt's as dull as tombs over here.

33:24.855 --> 33:26.322
Won't you come in?

33:27.524 --> 33:29.253
No, l'm not to stay.

33:29.326 --> 33:32.762
Please. Just for a few minutes.
l've ordered tea.

33:43.774 --> 33:46.743
Christopher Columbus!

33:47.778 --> 33:49.541
What richness!

33:54.484 --> 33:56.247
lt's just like summer!

33:56.320 --> 33:58.788
This is marvelous!

33:59.523 --> 34:00.888
lt's so roomy.

34:04.628 --> 34:06.255
How many, please?

34:06.630 --> 34:08.393
Two, please. Three.

34:09.199 --> 34:12.657
How do you like it here after living
in Europe so long, Mr. Laurence?

34:12.735 --> 34:13.929
l'm going to Europe.

34:14.004 --> 34:16.234
-Really? When?
-l don't know.

34:16.306 --> 34:19.070
My aunt has rheumatism
and the doctor thought the baths....

34:19.141 --> 34:21.871
Not that she hasn't a bath.
She has a very nice one.

34:21.945 --> 34:24.038
Did you take any baths
while you were there?

34:24.114 --> 34:27.514
-l mean, for rheumatism.
-No, l'm not troubled with rheumatism.

34:27.583 --> 34:30.746
Neither am l. But she thought
that baths wouldn't do me any harm.

34:30.821 --> 34:33.289
l mean, that is to say, while l was there.

34:33.357 --> 34:36.018
You see,
l've always wanted to go to Europe.

34:36.092 --> 34:38.652
Not for the baths, of course,
but for my writing.

34:38.728 --> 34:41.755
You see, my aunt....
But you don't know Aunt March, do you?

34:41.831 --> 34:44.527
Well, never mind.
What were you saying, Mr. Laurence?

34:46.570 --> 34:48.936
l'm not Mr. Laurence. l'm only Laurie.

34:49.473 --> 34:50.701
Laurie.

34:51.608 --> 34:53.735
How do you like it here after Europe?

34:53.944 --> 34:56.742
lt's strange
after living in schools all my life...

34:56.813 --> 34:59.646
...but it will be all right
when l get used to Grandfather.

34:59.716 --> 35:01.081
You know, he....

35:01.318 --> 35:04.913
Yes, you should have seen him
before you came.

35:04.988 --> 35:08.617
-lsn't he a holy terror?
-You ought to see Aunt March.

35:11.962 --> 35:15.523
lt's too pretty to eat.
l wish we had things like this over here.

35:16.066 --> 35:17.328
And l wish....

35:18.735 --> 35:19.963
lt is nice, isn't it?

35:20.037 --> 35:23.165
My little sister put on the geranium leaves.
She's very artistic.

35:23.240 --> 35:25.970
-Amy?
-Yes. How do you know?

35:27.611 --> 35:29.977
l often hear you calling to one another...

35:30.047 --> 35:33.210
...and when l'm alone over here....

35:35.352 --> 35:37.980
l beg your pardon for being so rude...

35:38.922 --> 35:41.982
...but sometimes you forget
to put down the curtains...

35:42.159 --> 35:46.425
...and when the lamps are lighted,
it's like looking at a picture...

35:46.530 --> 35:49.465
...to see you all around the table
with your mother.

35:50.567 --> 35:52.967
You always seem to be having
such good times.

35:53.637 --> 35:56.003
We'll never draw that curtain anymore.

35:56.773 --> 35:59.901
And l give you leave
to look as much as you like.

35:59.976 --> 36:02.911
l wish instead of just peeping,
you'd come over and see us.

36:03.180 --> 36:05.045
We'd have jolly times together.

36:05.115 --> 36:08.983
Would you let me be in a play?
l saw some of it the other night.

36:09.252 --> 36:10.651
That was terrible.

36:10.787 --> 36:13.221
l want to put on <i>Hamlet</i>
and do the fencing scene.

36:13.290 --> 36:16.191
l could play Laertes.
l took fencing lessons at the academy.

36:16.259 --> 36:17.453
-Really?
-Yes, look.

36:18.095 --> 36:20.393
Look. <i>En garde!</i>

36:21.565 --> 36:23.430
-Splendid!
-Here.

36:24.534 --> 36:26.866
''Come, for the third, Laertes,
you but dally.''

36:26.937 --> 36:28.598
''Say you so? Come on.''

36:31.541 --> 36:34.840
-''Another hit; what say you?''
-''A touch, a touch, l do confess.''

36:38.115 --> 36:40.606
What is this? What on earth?

36:40.750 --> 36:42.081
What's going on?

36:42.552 --> 36:43.883
l don't know, sir.

36:46.356 --> 36:47.721
''Have at you now! ''

36:48.825 --> 36:49.814
l say....

36:50.193 --> 36:52.354
-Are you hurt?
-No.

36:52.829 --> 36:55.389
-No, nothing ever hurts me.
-l'm sorry.

36:55.465 --> 36:58.525
l forgot you were a girl
and l'm afraid l got a bit too rough.

36:58.602 --> 37:02.732
What are you talking about?
l had you bettered if l hadn't slipped.

37:05.342 --> 37:08.140
That's a good picture of your grandfather.

37:08.211 --> 37:11.977
He looks pretty grim,
but l shouldn't be afraid of him.

37:12.382 --> 37:15.442
Though l can see how his face
might frighten some people.

37:19.222 --> 37:21.190
l'll wait upstairs, sir.

37:23.126 --> 37:27.756
His eyes are kind and l like him
even though he does bark at you so.

37:28.498 --> 37:30.125
Thank you, ma'am.

37:31.835 --> 37:33.769
So you're not afraid of me?

37:35.939 --> 37:38.339
No, sir, not much.

37:38.408 --> 37:41.104
But my face will frighten some people?

37:43.113 --> 37:46.605
-l only said ''might.''
-And l bark, do l?

37:47.450 --> 37:49.941
No, sir, perhaps not all the time.

37:50.554 --> 37:52.613
But with all that, you like me?

37:52.689 --> 37:54.919
Yes, sir. l do.

37:55.225 --> 37:56.749
l do.

37:58.094 --> 37:59.618
And l like you.

38:05.101 --> 38:08.264
Grandfather, you should see her fence.
Come on, let's show him.

38:08.338 --> 38:11.432
-No. l've been here too long now.
-l'll see you home.

38:11.608 --> 38:16.409
No, you stay indoors, young man.
l shall see Miss March home.

38:17.013 --> 38:19.174
l want to pay my respects
to your mother...

38:19.249 --> 38:21.717
...and thank her for the medicine
she sent my boy.

38:21.785 --> 38:23.878
l can see it's done him lots of good.

38:27.257 --> 38:30.590
You get upstairs and do your sums.
Brooke is waiting for you.

38:30.660 --> 38:33.595
And see that you behave yourself
like a gentleman, sir.

38:33.663 --> 38:35.062
Goodbye, Jo.

38:38.935 --> 38:40.800
Here they come.

38:40.870 --> 38:44.362
All dressed up
and looking as pretty as pictures.

38:45.609 --> 38:49.272
Amy, how dainty. You look lovely.

38:52.282 --> 38:55.979
l wish Laurie hadn't asked me to his party.
l know l shall be frightened.

38:56.052 --> 38:59.488
You wouldn't want to hurt his feelings
when he's been so kind.

39:00.290 --> 39:03.350
Meg, the dress is lovely.

39:03.927 --> 39:05.588
Thank you, Marmee.

39:07.764 --> 39:09.288
Jo, you look splendid.

39:09.366 --> 39:11.698
l feel perfectly miserable with 19 hairpins...

39:11.768 --> 39:15.795
...all sticking straight into my head,
but, dear me, let us be elegant or die.

39:15.872 --> 39:17.339
Does the patch show much?

39:17.407 --> 39:18.931
lt does a little, Marmee.

39:19.009 --> 39:22.775
But she's going to sit down or else stand
with her back against the wall.

39:22.846 --> 39:24.711
Jo, where are your gloves?

39:25.415 --> 39:27.883
l've stained them, so l'm going without.

39:27.951 --> 39:29.782
You wear gloves or l don't go.

39:29.853 --> 39:32.583
l tried to clean them,
but it only made them look worse.

39:32.656 --> 39:35.557
l'll carry them
and hold them crumpled up in one hand.

39:35.625 --> 39:37.616
-Nobody will see them.
-Jo!

39:38.261 --> 39:41.424
l'll tell you.
We'll each wear one of your nice ones...

39:41.498 --> 39:45.662
...and carry one of my bad ones,
then the effect will be fine and easy.

39:46.202 --> 39:49.933
All right, only be careful of it,
and don't stretch it.

39:51.141 --> 39:55.009
And, Jo, dear, do behave nicely
and don't put your hands behind your back.

39:55.445 --> 39:56.707
Good night, Marmee.

39:56.780 --> 39:59.374
Above everything, don't say:
''Christopher Columbus! ''...

39:59.449 --> 40:00.882
...and disgrace us all.

40:00.950 --> 40:03.009
Hold your tongue, Miss Baby.

40:03.086 --> 40:07.318
l'll be as prim as l can be and not get into
any scrapes, if l can help it.

40:56.873 --> 40:59.307
May l engage you for this dance,
Miss March?

40:59.376 --> 41:01.469
No, thank you, l'm not dancing.

41:13.423 --> 41:15.914
-There's that Kitty Ford.
-Where?

41:15.992 --> 41:18.085
There in the pink dress and blue sash.

41:18.161 --> 41:22.461
l don't see why she's allowed with
the grownups and l have to stay up here.

41:22.532 --> 41:24.625
That beautiful piano.

41:25.835 --> 41:27.632
lt's as big as our kitchen.

41:31.241 --> 41:34.802
What's this? Why aren't you young ladies
downstairs dancing?

41:34.878 --> 41:37.438
Mother said we weren't to go down
with the grownups.

41:37.514 --> 41:40.347
But can you see anything from here?
How about you?

41:41.251 --> 41:43.481
She just likes to listen to the music.

41:43.553 --> 41:46.021
You just come down with me
where it's playing.

41:46.089 --> 41:50.082
-No, sir, please. l....
-Why not? What's the matter?

41:51.628 --> 41:53.596
She has an infirmity.

41:54.864 --> 41:55.956
She's shy.

41:57.233 --> 41:58.427
l see.

41:58.701 --> 42:01.295
lf it weren't for that,
she'd be simply ''fastidious''...

42:01.371 --> 42:03.464
...because she plays beautifully.

42:04.140 --> 42:06.233
She must come and play for me sometime.

42:06.309 --> 42:08.038
No, she never would.

42:08.845 --> 42:11.336
lt wasn't that l wanted to hear her.

42:11.414 --> 42:15.214
But that piano down there
is simply going to ruin for want of use.

42:15.351 --> 42:18.684
l was hoping one of you young ladies
would come and practice on it...

42:18.755 --> 42:20.985
...just to keep it in tune.

42:22.358 --> 42:25.156
-But if you don't care to come, never mind.
-Sir.

42:25.528 --> 42:28.463
We do care. Very, very much.

42:30.266 --> 42:32.359
So you're the musical one.

42:33.069 --> 42:35.799
l'm Beth. l love it dearly...

42:36.239 --> 42:39.868
...and l'll come if you're quite sure
nobody will hear me and be disturbed.

42:39.943 --> 42:42.343
Not a soul, my child. Not a soul.

42:45.381 --> 42:46.973
You come, too, young lady...

42:47.050 --> 42:51.009
...and tell your mother l think
all her daughters are simply ''fastidious.''

42:55.325 --> 42:57.156
Beth, isn't he elegant?

43:03.867 --> 43:07.598
This is the German, and l'll be hanged
if l'll let you refuse me all of them.

43:08.705 --> 43:10.104
Don't you like to dance?

43:10.173 --> 43:13.540
Yes, l love to dance, but l can't.

43:14.210 --> 43:16.906
-l mean, l promised l wouldn't.
-Why?

43:17.714 --> 43:21.275
-l may as well tell you. You won't tell?
-Silence to the death.

43:21.451 --> 43:24.477
You see, l have a bad trick
of standing in front of the fire...

43:24.554 --> 43:27.455
...and l scorched my frock
and l burned this one.

43:27.690 --> 43:28.850
Where?

43:31.327 --> 43:34.353
You can laugh if you want to. lt is funny.

43:36.065 --> 43:37.794
l'll tell you how we'll manage.

43:37.901 --> 43:41.860
There's no one in the hall.
We could dance there without being seen.

43:48.011 --> 43:51.378
-You're a trump.
-And l think you're just perfectly splendid.

44:12.969 --> 44:13.901
Hello.

44:13.970 --> 44:16.438
What are you doing up there?
Come on down.

44:17.840 --> 44:19.137
No, they can't.

44:20.877 --> 44:22.344
Have you had refreshments?

44:22.812 --> 44:25.781
No, thank you, we really don't care for--

44:28.284 --> 44:30.343
We'll bring some right up. Come on.

44:31.120 --> 44:34.351
Then when Laurie goes to college,
what becomes of you?

44:34.557 --> 44:38.015
l shall turn soldier as soon as he is off.
l am needed.

44:39.963 --> 44:41.521
l'm so sorry.

44:44.100 --> 44:48.560
l mean, l'm so sorry
for all the mothers and sisters...

44:48.638 --> 44:50.538
...who have to stay home and worry.

44:50.607 --> 44:54.407
l have neither and very few friends
to care whether l live or die.

44:55.645 --> 44:58.512
Laurie and his grandfather
would care a great deal.

44:59.115 --> 45:03.245
And we all would be very sorry
if any harm came to you.

45:05.321 --> 45:06.379
Would you?

45:06.756 --> 45:07.984
Here we come.

45:10.893 --> 45:11.882
Jo!

45:16.132 --> 45:17.463
Now you've done it!

45:22.772 --> 45:25.366
-Look at me.
-lt's a shame.

45:25.441 --> 45:27.033
What a blunderbuss l am.

45:27.243 --> 45:28.676
What are you going to do?

45:29.212 --> 45:30.804
l'll ask Marmee.

45:35.118 --> 45:38.986
Have you two been hiding? l've been
looking all over the house for you.

45:39.055 --> 45:40.454
Hannah's here.

45:40.623 --> 45:43.490
-ls it that late?
-Time slips away.

45:45.294 --> 45:48.229
-Good night, Mr. Brooke.
-Good night, Miss Margaret.

45:54.871 --> 45:55.860
Miss Margaret?

46:04.180 --> 46:06.808
-Goodbye. l'm glad you came.
-We had an elegant time.

46:06.883 --> 46:08.214
Good night, Amy.

46:10.753 --> 46:11.720
Good night.

46:11.888 --> 46:14.288
-Good night, Laurie.
-Good night, Miss Margaret.

46:14.357 --> 46:15.483
Laurie!

46:16.092 --> 46:17.389
Good night, everybody.

46:17.460 --> 46:19.894
-Don't forget your ice skates tomorrow.
-l won't.

46:19.962 --> 46:21.862
-Good night.
-Good night.

46:33.042 --> 46:35.169
There, l've done my best.

46:35.378 --> 46:38.677
lf that won't do,
l'll have to wait until l can do better.

47:21.224 --> 47:23.192
Why, what are you up to?

47:28.264 --> 47:31.097
lt's a pair of slippers
l worked for Mr. Laurence.

47:31.234 --> 47:34.692
He's been so kind about letting me play
on his beautiful piano.

47:34.804 --> 47:37.534
l didn't know any other way
to thank him, Jo.

47:37.707 --> 47:40.232
-Do you think they're all right?
-They're beautiful.

47:40.309 --> 47:44.075
And l think you're sweet.
Hey, isn't that Amy's hair ribbon?

47:44.280 --> 47:47.681
Yes, but l think
she was going to throw it away.

47:47.750 --> 47:49.308
You think?

47:49.619 --> 47:52.247
You'd better vamoose
before she catches you.

48:13.009 --> 48:15.637
Now l'll find out why you come
to this hole every day.

48:15.711 --> 48:18.236
ls that why you never have
any time for me anymore?

48:18.314 --> 48:22.216
Laurie Laurence, give that to me
or l'll never speak to you again!

48:22.552 --> 48:24.315
All right, take it.

48:28.324 --> 48:29.655
You're a fine one.

48:29.725 --> 48:32.489
l thought we weren't to have any secrets
from each other.

48:32.562 --> 48:35.963
Well, this is altogether different.
l beg your pardon.

48:36.032 --> 48:40.526
Of course, it's different. Just like a girl.
Can't keep an agreement.

48:40.736 --> 48:42.067
Oh, bilge!

48:45.274 --> 48:46.901
You'll be sorry.

48:47.410 --> 48:50.402
l was going to tell you
something very plummy.

48:51.380 --> 48:52.677
A secret.

48:53.115 --> 48:55.879
All about people you know, and such fun.

48:55.952 --> 48:58.250
-What?
-lf l tell you, you must tell me yours.

48:58.321 --> 49:00.380
-You won't say anything at home?
-Not a word.

49:00.456 --> 49:04.222
-You won't tease me about it in private?
-l never tease. Fire away.

49:19.508 --> 49:22.033
l sold my story to the Spread Eagle.

49:22.645 --> 49:24.442
Hurrah for Miss March.

49:24.847 --> 49:29.682
Hurrah for Miss March!
The celebrated American authoress!

49:29.752 --> 49:32.050
l didn't want anyone to know until it's out.

49:32.121 --> 49:34.919
-Won't it be fun to see it in print?
-Now, what's yours?

49:34.991 --> 49:38.256
-l know where Meg's glove is.
-ls that all?

49:38.327 --> 49:40.352
-Wait till you hear where it is.
-Where?

49:42.365 --> 49:43.957
-How do you know?
-l saw it.

49:44.033 --> 49:45.500
-Where?
-Pocket.

49:45.601 --> 49:47.501
-All this time?
-lsn't it romantic?

49:47.970 --> 49:49.995
''Romantic''? Rubbish!

49:50.806 --> 49:54.401
l never heard of anything so horrid.
l wish you hadn't told me.

49:54.510 --> 49:56.910
Of all the sickly sentimental....

49:57.346 --> 50:00.611
Why do things always have to change
just when they're perfect?

50:00.883 --> 50:04.284
Meg always used to tell me everything.
Now she keeps things to herself.

50:04.353 --> 50:07.652
She thinks brown eyes are beautiful
and John is a lovely name.

50:07.823 --> 50:11.122
He'd better keep away from me
or l'll tell him what l think of him...

50:11.193 --> 50:14.390
...trying to break up other people's
happiness and spoil their fun.

50:14.463 --> 50:17.023
lt doesn't spoil any fun.
lt makes it twice as good.

50:17.266 --> 50:19.791
You'll find out
when someone falls in love with you.

50:19.869 --> 50:21.803
Soft summer day.

50:22.638 --> 50:24.663
Sun setting through the trees.

50:26.175 --> 50:28.666
Your lover's arms stealing around you.

50:28.945 --> 50:31.470
-l'd like to see anybody try it.
-Would you?

50:50.733 --> 50:52.223
l'll get you!

50:55.271 --> 50:56.738
Now l've got you.

50:57.340 --> 50:58.238
Wait!

51:00.343 --> 51:03.073
Look out, look out! Let me in, let me in!

51:03.579 --> 51:07.037
-Hey, look out, Laurie. Don't act like that.
-l'm sorry, Meg.

51:08.217 --> 51:11.778
l'd have beaten her though
if l hadn't tripped and fell.

51:12.855 --> 51:14.550
You should have seen....

51:15.992 --> 51:19.189
-lt's been a most enjoyable afternoon.
-Thank you.

51:19.261 --> 51:21.889
Paying visits has never been
quite so much fun before.

51:21.964 --> 51:24.296
l hope we may do it again very soon.

51:28.404 --> 51:30.838
Goodbye, Mr. Brooke. Come along, Meg.

51:31.107 --> 51:33.667
-Good afternoon, Mr. Brooke.
-Goodbye, Miss Margaret.

51:33.743 --> 51:35.836
-Good afternoon, Laurie.
-Goodbye, Jo.

51:35.911 --> 51:38.641
-Coming, Laurie?
-All right. See you tomorrow, Jo.

51:40.516 --> 51:42.780
l've never been so embarrassed in my life.

51:42.852 --> 51:45.446
When will you stop
your childish romping ways?

51:45.521 --> 51:48.957
Not until l'm old and stiff,
and have to use a crutch.

52:03.072 --> 52:04.096
Jo!

52:05.775 --> 52:08.471
-Hello, Bethie.
-Hello, Jo.

52:08.978 --> 52:10.309
How's my girl?

52:14.917 --> 52:16.350
There's a surprise.

52:16.585 --> 52:18.815
-Come on and hurry up.
-Come on, Jo.

52:21.424 --> 52:22.482
What is it?

52:23.559 --> 52:25.322
Stop yelling. What is it?

52:25.394 --> 52:27.191
Christopher Columbus!

52:40.276 --> 52:41.265
For me?

52:41.510 --> 52:44.104
lsn't it the most beautiful piano
you've ever seen?

52:44.180 --> 52:45.613
Look, this came with it.

52:45.681 --> 52:48.514
-Quick, read it. See what he says.
-l'll read it.

52:49.285 --> 52:52.482
''To Miss Elizabeth March. Dear Madam.''

52:52.721 --> 52:53.915
How elegant.

52:54.557 --> 52:59.790
''l've had many pairs of slippers in my life,
but none that suited me as well as yours.

53:00.963 --> 53:06.265
''l like to pay my debts, so l know
you will allow me to send you something...

53:06.402 --> 53:09.633
''...that belonged
to the little granddaughter l lost.

53:10.439 --> 53:12.907
''With hearty thanks and best wishes...

53:13.008 --> 53:18.378
''...l remain your grateful friend
and humble servant, James Laurence.''

53:18.848 --> 53:20.008
Oh, Bethie!

53:20.416 --> 53:24.079
-lsn't he a really sweet old man?
-Look at these lovely brackets.

53:26.288 --> 53:27.812
Look, it opens!

53:29.125 --> 53:31.457
-You'll have to thank him.
-Yes.

53:32.628 --> 53:34.289
l'll go right now.

53:37.366 --> 53:41.359
Well, l wish l may die!
She'd never have gone in her right mind.

53:52.348 --> 53:53.337
Come in.

54:05.928 --> 54:08.123
l came to thank you, sir.

54:23.879 --> 54:27.576
''But when the piece began, the dogs,
the dames and private ends went mad...

54:27.650 --> 54:28.810
''...and bit the man.

54:28.884 --> 54:32.149
''Around from the neighboring streets
the wondering neighbors ran...

54:32.221 --> 54:35.054
''...and swore the dog'd lost his wits
to bite so good a man.

54:35.124 --> 54:37.888
''The wound seemed sore and sad
to every Christian eye...

54:37.960 --> 54:39.928
''...and while they swore
the dog was mad--''

54:39.995 --> 54:41.394
Look, Marmee.

54:43.399 --> 54:44.388
Ms. March!

54:44.867 --> 54:48.530
Ms. March. lt's one of them
telegraph things, ma'am.

54:55.978 --> 54:57.411
lt's Father.

54:58.581 --> 55:02.608
He's in the hospital.
l must go to Washington at once.

55:04.086 --> 55:06.316
Put those in the corner, dear.

55:07.022 --> 55:09.183
What on earth is keeping Jo?

55:10.025 --> 55:11.583
This is all packed, Marmee.

55:11.660 --> 55:14.925
-l don't believe l've forgotten a thing.
-Thank you, dear.

55:14.997 --> 55:17.329
While l'm away, don't forget the Hummel's.

55:17.399 --> 55:19.594
-We won't.
-We'll do our best, Marmee.

55:20.236 --> 55:23.034
Here we are. Here's some excellent port
for your husband.

55:23.105 --> 55:26.768
-Thank you. How generous.
-l hope you find this dressing gown useful.

55:26.842 --> 55:29.709
Everything's arranged
and Brooke will go with you.

55:30.613 --> 55:32.205
There's no need. l'll be fine.

55:32.281 --> 55:35.148
He's all prepared.
He has commissions for me in Washington.

55:35.217 --> 55:39.210
-He'll be of help to you on the journey.
-How thoughtful of you.

55:42.191 --> 55:46.218
lt's such a relief to know that Marmee
will have someone to take care of her.

55:46.295 --> 55:48.388
Thank you, very, very much.

55:48.664 --> 55:49.892
Not at all, Miss Margaret.

55:49.965 --> 55:53.799
My kind friend, l can't thank you....

55:57.673 --> 56:00.437
Laurie's outside with the carriage.
We'll wait for you.

56:00.509 --> 56:01.908
The train leaves in an hour.

56:01.977 --> 56:03.911
Here, ma'am, you'll need this.

56:04.079 --> 56:06.707
-l couldn't.
-Please, Marmee, take it.

56:07.483 --> 56:09.178
Where is Jo?

56:15.124 --> 56:17.718
-Jo, what kept you?
-Jo, whatever took you so long?

56:17.793 --> 56:20.193
Here's the money from Aunt March.

56:22.131 --> 56:25.294
And there's my contribution.

56:28.570 --> 56:31.232
$25. Where did you get it?

56:32.207 --> 56:34.437
-My dear!
-lt's mine, honestly.

56:34.510 --> 56:36.774
l only sold what belonged to me.

56:40.482 --> 56:41.642
Your hair!

56:41.850 --> 56:43.511
Jo, you shouldn't have done it.

56:43.652 --> 56:47.611
Aunt March croaked, as she always does,
when asked for nine pence.

56:47.856 --> 56:51.587
Marmee, she only sent you
just money enough for the ticket.

56:51.727 --> 56:53.422
l knew you would need more...

56:53.495 --> 56:56.225
...so l happened to be going past
a barber shop...

56:56.298 --> 56:59.028
...and l saw some tails of hair
hanging in the window...

56:59.101 --> 57:01.501
...with the prices marked on them...

57:02.104 --> 57:05.767
...and l thought it would do my brain good
to have my mop cut off.

57:05.841 --> 57:07.832
And so l did.

57:10.379 --> 57:11.505
Thank you, dearie.

57:11.647 --> 57:14.639
Are you ready, Marmee?
We'll have to hurry to catch....

57:14.750 --> 57:17.184
Christopher Columbus!

57:17.986 --> 57:22.013
Well, it's boyish, becoming,
and easy to keep in order.

57:22.257 --> 57:24.919
-Marmee, you'll miss your train.
-Yes, Marmee, come on.

57:24.993 --> 57:28.724
-Now, girls, go on with your work as usual.
-We will, Marmee.

57:32.835 --> 57:34.928
Can't we go to the train with you,
Marmee?

57:35.003 --> 57:38.996
No, l want you all to stay here
and comfort each other.

57:40.576 --> 57:44.034
Meg, dear, watch over your sisters.

57:45.414 --> 57:46.847
Be patient, Jo.

57:48.450 --> 57:50.441
Jo, don't do anything rash.

57:50.753 --> 57:53.722
Beth, dear, help all you can.

57:55.758 --> 57:59.819
Amy, be obedient.

58:01.630 --> 58:04.827
No, l want you to stay here.

58:05.868 --> 58:10.567
l want to carry away a picture in my mind
of my brave little women to take to Father.

58:11.006 --> 58:13.941
-Goodbye, my darlings.
-Goodbye, Marmee.

58:18.013 --> 58:20.982
God bless us and keep us all.

58:47.376 --> 58:49.071
Jo, are you awake?

58:53.715 --> 58:56.479
Jo, you're crying.

58:57.986 --> 58:59.578
No, l'm not.

59:01.657 --> 59:03.022
Don't cry, dear.

59:03.625 --> 59:07.686
Father will be all right
and Mr. Brooke will take care of Marmee.

59:09.431 --> 59:11.991
l'm not crying because of that.

59:12.634 --> 59:13.931
What then?

59:15.437 --> 59:17.302
My hair.

59:23.879 --> 59:27.940
''Yet 'tis whispered that when the gondolas
glide through those fatal waters...

59:28.016 --> 59:32.419
''...they still run crimson with the blood
of Lady Viella and her gallant lover...

59:33.121 --> 59:35.715
''...slain by the phantom hand.

59:37.426 --> 59:38.688
''The End.''

59:39.328 --> 59:42.855
lt gives me the shivers.
l'm pins and needles all over.

59:42.931 --> 59:45.923
lt's so exciting and so sad. Who wrote it?

59:47.903 --> 59:49.200
Your sister.

59:49.404 --> 59:50.803
-Really, Jo?
-What?

59:52.207 --> 59:53.139
Let me see.

59:53.208 --> 59:55.676
-And l knew it all the time.
-lsn't that wonderful?

59:55.744 --> 59:59.236
Here it is: ''By Miss Josephine March.''

59:59.515 --> 01:00:02.313
Oh, Jo! l can't believe it!

01:00:02.484 --> 01:00:03.576
Beth!

01:00:04.186 --> 01:00:07.349
Jo's written a story and it's in the paper.
lsn't that marvelous?

01:00:07.422 --> 01:00:08.912
-Really?
-Look!

01:00:09.224 --> 01:00:10.816
Don't come near me.

01:00:16.465 --> 01:00:18.490
Something's wrong with Beth.

01:00:18.567 --> 01:00:19.932
What is it?

01:00:21.036 --> 01:00:22.867
-l don't know.
-Where is she?

01:00:24.039 --> 01:00:25.301
ln Marmee's cupboard.

01:00:25.374 --> 01:00:27.569
What's wrong? What's going on?

01:00:29.278 --> 01:00:31.041
Darling, what is it?

01:00:31.213 --> 01:00:32.771
Bethie, what is it?

01:00:32.848 --> 01:00:34.941
-What's wrong, Bethie?
-What is it?

01:00:39.555 --> 01:00:41.318
The baby's dead.

01:00:41.423 --> 01:00:43.618
-What baby?
-Mrs. Hummel's.

01:00:44.459 --> 01:00:46.256
lt died in my lap...

01:00:47.930 --> 01:00:50.763
...before she got back with the doctor, Jo.

01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:53.300
Now, there, there.

01:00:53.468 --> 01:00:56.062
The doctor said it was scarlet fever.

01:00:56.972 --> 01:00:58.667
-Scarlet fever!
-Hannah!

01:01:00.142 --> 01:01:02.372
You don't think l'll get it, do you, Jo?

01:01:02.444 --> 01:01:04.412
Oh, no, Bethie, of course you won't.

01:01:04.479 --> 01:01:07.642
But Amy must keep away
'cause she's never had it.

01:01:09.051 --> 01:01:10.678
How does it start, Jo?

01:01:10.752 --> 01:01:15.553
With a sort of a headache and sore throat...

01:01:15.891 --> 01:01:17.882
...and queer feelings all over?

01:01:18.594 --> 01:01:20.221
l don't remember.

01:01:20.329 --> 01:01:22.559
Laurie, give me that doctor's book.

01:01:22.631 --> 01:01:25.964
Jo, l think we'd better get her to bed.
Come along, Bethie.

01:01:26.201 --> 01:01:27.668
l'll find out what to do.

01:01:28.604 --> 01:01:30.936
-l'll be all right.
-Of course you'll be all right.

01:01:31.006 --> 01:01:31.995
Here it is.

01:01:34.176 --> 01:01:37.976
Go get Dr. Bangs, will you, Mr. Laurie?
Have him come over as soon as he can.

01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:42.176
You stay down here, Amy. You're to go off
to Aunt March's for a spell, just in case.

01:01:42.250 --> 01:01:45.617
l won't! l'll stay right here with Beth.

01:01:45.721 --> 01:01:47.120
Be quiet for once, Amy!

01:01:47.189 --> 01:01:48.986
l'm not going to be sent away.

01:01:49.091 --> 01:01:51.582
l advise you to go, Amy.
Scarlet fever's no joke.

01:01:51.693 --> 01:01:53.285
Well, l don't care!

01:01:54.096 --> 01:01:57.532
l'd rather get scarlet fever and die
than go to Aunt March's.

01:01:57.599 --> 01:02:02.696
Now, Amy, be a good girl. l'll pop around
there every day and tell you how Beth is.

01:02:04.106 --> 01:02:07.906
l'll tell you what. Every day,
l'll come and take you out driving.

01:02:09.411 --> 01:02:12.608
-Well, yes.
-That's our girl.

01:02:13.582 --> 01:02:17.177
Oh, Bethie, if you should really be ill,
l'll never forgive myself.

01:02:17.252 --> 01:02:20.187
l let you go to the Hummel's every day
when l should've gone.

01:02:20.255 --> 01:02:23.156
No, it's my fault.
l'm the oldest and l should've gone.

01:02:23.558 --> 01:02:27.654
l promised Marmee l'd look after you.
Don't you think we ought to telegraph her?

01:02:27.729 --> 01:02:28.753
No, we mustn't.

01:02:28.830 --> 01:02:32.391
She can't leave your father and
it'll only make her all the more anxious.

01:02:32.467 --> 01:02:35.561
Please don't telegraph, Jo.
Hannah knows just what to do.

01:02:37.739 --> 01:02:39.297
l feel better already.

01:03:09.337 --> 01:03:13.899
lf Mrs. March can leave her husband,
we'd better send for her.

01:03:14.676 --> 01:03:18.874
The girls had the telegram all ready,
but l wouldn't let them send it.

01:03:19.481 --> 01:03:21.676
And now, the poor lady.

01:03:21.883 --> 01:03:23.714
Oh, Mother.

01:03:25.687 --> 01:03:28.485
What if she shouldn't get here in time?

01:04:24.146 --> 01:04:25.773
ls it that bad?

01:04:29.317 --> 01:04:30.875
She doesn't know me.

01:04:32.487 --> 01:04:35.422
She doesn't look like my Beth.

01:04:37.993 --> 01:04:40.393
How are we going to bear it?

01:04:42.864 --> 01:04:46.391
Mother and Father, they seem so far away.

01:04:48.370 --> 01:04:49.564
l'm here.

01:04:51.540 --> 01:04:52.939
Hold on to me.

01:04:53.508 --> 01:04:55.442
Jo, dear.

01:04:59.581 --> 01:05:02.846
Poor Jo. You're all worn out.

01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:07.552
What does the doctor say?

01:05:08.290 --> 01:05:10.588
We're sending for Marmee.

01:05:11.893 --> 01:05:14.225
lf she were only here.

01:05:14.296 --> 01:05:19.131
She will be. Grandfather and l got fidgety
and thought your mother ought to know.

01:05:19.234 --> 01:05:23.364
She'd just never forgive us if Beth....
Well, if anything happened...

01:05:23.705 --> 01:05:25.468
...so l telegraphed yesterday.

01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:28.839
She'll be here, on the 2:00 train tonight,
and l'm going to meet her.

01:05:28.910 --> 01:05:31.310
Oh, Laurie! Oh, Marmee!

01:05:35.417 --> 01:05:38.648
l beg your pardon, but you're such a dear.

01:05:39.788 --> 01:05:42.222
l couldn't help flying at you.

01:05:42.324 --> 01:05:44.815
Fly at me again. l rather like it.

01:05:45.026 --> 01:05:46.459
Laurie, you're so silly.

01:05:46.528 --> 01:05:48.018
l'd better go.

01:05:51.166 --> 01:05:53.566
Well, to the railroad station.

01:05:54.703 --> 01:05:56.796
And l shan't spare the horses.

01:05:57.038 --> 01:05:59.165
Bless you, Laurie, bless you.

01:06:11.453 --> 01:06:14.183
lf you really want Bethie...

01:06:15.690 --> 01:06:18.750
...please wait until Marmee comes home.

01:06:21.363 --> 01:06:24.355
But, God, please don't...

01:06:25.767 --> 01:06:27.325
...because she's so....

01:06:29.004 --> 01:06:30.494
Please don't.

01:07:27.162 --> 01:07:28.959
lf God spares Bethie...

01:07:30.231 --> 01:07:32.756
...l'll love him and serve him all my life.

01:07:35.603 --> 01:07:40.631
lf life's as hard as this, l don't see
how we shall ever get through it.

01:08:03.131 --> 01:08:04.655
What is it? What is it?

01:08:23.752 --> 01:08:25.947
Goodbye, my Bethie.

01:08:26.988 --> 01:08:27.977
Goodbye.

01:08:44.305 --> 01:08:45.772
The fever's turned.

01:08:46.174 --> 01:08:49.439
-She's sleeping naturally.
-The Lord be praised.

01:09:06.728 --> 01:09:08.957
Marmee's here. She's come.

01:09:13.935 --> 01:09:16.233
lt's so wonderful to have Bethie with us.

01:09:16.304 --> 01:09:18.363
Come on, everything's all ready.

01:09:23.444 --> 01:09:26.209
ls she all right?
She's not very heavy, is she?

01:09:38.292 --> 01:09:40.055
lt didn't tire you, did it, dear?

01:09:40.127 --> 01:09:42.562
See the lovely flowers
Mr. Laurence sent you.

01:09:43.631 --> 01:09:44.689
And my birds.

01:09:49.938 --> 01:09:52.337
l've never been so happy.

01:09:54.609 --> 01:09:56.873
Begging your pardon,
do the Marches live here?

01:09:59.114 --> 01:10:01.947
Wait till she sees what l brought for her.

01:10:05.019 --> 01:10:06.281
Father, dear.

01:10:06.888 --> 01:10:08.321
Father, is it really you?

01:10:27.709 --> 01:10:29.404
l can't believe she's walking.

01:10:36.551 --> 01:10:39.577
-Oh, my dear.
-She hasn't walked since she was ill.

01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:14.545
Are you expecting someone?

01:11:15.223 --> 01:11:16.952
Why, no. What do you mean?

01:11:26.334 --> 01:11:28.461
Why can't we stay as we are?

01:11:30.338 --> 01:11:32.306
Do you have to go and fall in love...

01:11:32.373 --> 01:11:36.104
...and spoil all our peace and fun
and happy times together?

01:11:39.013 --> 01:11:40.913
You're not like your old self a bit.

01:11:42.817 --> 01:11:46.378
And you're getting so far away from me.

01:11:48.756 --> 01:11:50.087
Meg, don't.

01:11:50.658 --> 01:11:52.922
Don't go and marry that man.

01:11:53.861 --> 01:11:56.489
l don't intend to go and marry any man.

01:11:56.631 --> 01:11:59.691
And if you mean Mr. Brooke,
he hasn't asked me.

01:12:00.868 --> 01:12:05.532
lf he should, l shall merely say
quite calmly and decidedly:

01:12:06.641 --> 01:12:09.735
''l'm sorry but l agree with Mother
that it's too soon.''

01:12:10.011 --> 01:12:14.175
Oh, Meg! Hurrah for you! You're a trump.

01:12:14.282 --> 01:12:15.249
My hair.

01:12:15.316 --> 01:12:18.945
Then things will be as they used to be,
and now that Father's home--

01:12:23.057 --> 01:12:25.548
l'll go. l'll get out of the way.
Now don't forget.

01:12:25.927 --> 01:12:29.192
lf l could only see his face
when you tell him.

01:12:39.307 --> 01:12:41.207
Why, Mr. Brooke.

01:12:41.542 --> 01:12:43.032
Good day, Miss Margaret.

01:12:43.645 --> 01:12:45.306
Won't you come in?

01:12:46.314 --> 01:12:48.305
l came to get my umbrella.

01:12:49.017 --> 01:12:51.952
That is to see
how your father finds himself today.

01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:54.020
Why, he's here in the rack.

01:12:54.722 --> 01:12:57.054
l mean, it's very well.

01:12:58.026 --> 01:12:59.015
l mean....

01:13:00.128 --> 01:13:02.062
l'll tell him you're here.

01:13:02.530 --> 01:13:03.690
Oh, please.

01:13:04.632 --> 01:13:06.395
Are you afraid of me, Margaret?

01:13:08.369 --> 01:13:11.270
How could l be
when you've been so kind to Father?

01:13:12.373 --> 01:13:14.364
l only wish l could thank you for it.

01:13:14.542 --> 01:13:15.702
You can.

01:13:16.077 --> 01:13:17.977
-Shall l tell you how?
-No.

01:13:19.147 --> 01:13:20.910
Please don't.

01:13:20.982 --> 01:13:23.610
l only want to know
if you care for me a little, Meg.

01:13:24.218 --> 01:13:26.209
l love you so much, dear.

01:13:28.823 --> 01:13:30.814
Thank you, John.

01:13:33.027 --> 01:13:36.519
l agree with Mother, it's too soon.

01:13:36.831 --> 01:13:40.289
l'll wait. l don't mind how long
or how hard l have to work...

01:13:40.601 --> 01:13:43.593
...if l can only know
l'm to have my reward in the end.

01:13:43.671 --> 01:13:45.866
Please, give me a little hope.

01:13:46.541 --> 01:13:48.202
l'm afraid l can't.

01:13:50.478 --> 01:13:51.945
Do you really mean that?

01:13:53.181 --> 01:13:54.239
What's this?

01:13:54.382 --> 01:13:56.942
What's he doing here? Get along.

01:13:58.353 --> 01:13:59.911
What's going on here? Who is that?

01:13:59.987 --> 01:14:00.885
Mr. Brooke.

01:14:00.955 --> 01:14:04.413
The Laurence boy's tutor. Then it's true.

01:14:04.659 --> 01:14:07.184
He might hear you.
He's been so kind to Father.

01:14:07.295 --> 01:14:10.787
Well, he'll be much kinder
if he goes about his own business...

01:14:10.865 --> 01:14:12.992
...and leaves you alone. l won't stop.

01:14:13.167 --> 01:14:15.362
l'm only thinking of your own good,
Margaret.

01:14:15.436 --> 01:14:17.666
You should make a rich match
to help your family.

01:14:17.739 --> 01:14:20.537
This rude person has no money,
no position in life.

01:14:20.675 --> 01:14:22.734
That doesn't mean he never will have.

01:14:23.711 --> 01:14:27.704
So he's counting on my money.
He knows you've got rich relatives.

01:14:27.815 --> 01:14:30.181
Aunt March,
how dare you say such a thing.

01:14:30.251 --> 01:14:32.742
My John wouldn't marry for money
any more than l would.

01:14:32.820 --> 01:14:34.412
l'm not afraid of being poor.

01:14:34.489 --> 01:14:38.357
And l know we shall be happy
because John loves me and l love him.

01:14:39.527 --> 01:14:41.188
Hoity-toity.

01:14:41.462 --> 01:14:42.952
Remember this, young lady:

01:14:43.030 --> 01:14:46.659
lf you marry this rook or hook or crook,
he'll take care of you.

01:14:46.834 --> 01:14:49.632
Not one penny of my money will he get.

01:14:55.410 --> 01:14:56.968
My darling, did you mean it?

01:14:58.212 --> 01:15:01.010
l came back for my umbrella
and l couldn't help hearing.

01:15:01.249 --> 01:15:04.377
Then you will give me leave
to work for you and love you?

01:15:06.220 --> 01:15:07.551
Yes, John.

01:15:24.872 --> 01:15:29.241
''And there to have given
and pledged their troth each to the other...

01:15:29.944 --> 01:15:35.177
''...and have declared the same by giving
and receiving a ring and by joining hands...

01:15:36.684 --> 01:15:39.949
''...l pronounce that they are man and wife.

01:15:41.489 --> 01:15:45.357
''ln the name of the Father,
of the Son and of the Holy Ghost.

01:15:46.093 --> 01:15:47.117
''Amen.''

01:15:48.763 --> 01:15:51.493
''God the Father, God the Son...

01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:54.163
''...and God the Holy Ghost...

01:15:54.669 --> 01:15:57.001
''...bless, preserve and keep you...

01:15:57.672 --> 01:16:00.505
''...that ye may so live together
in this life...

01:16:01.242 --> 01:16:05.440
''...that in the world to come
ye may have life everlasting.

01:16:07.548 --> 01:16:08.537
''Amen.''

01:16:13.254 --> 01:16:15.279
The first kiss for Marmee.

01:16:22.363 --> 01:16:26.299
Well, John, you've been a traitor.
l hope you'll take care of her.

01:16:27.034 --> 01:16:28.968
You're a lucky fellow, John.

01:16:57.732 --> 01:16:59.893
-Goodbye, Amy.
-Goodbye.

01:17:18.519 --> 01:17:19.747
Don't mind, Jo.

01:17:24.225 --> 01:17:25.886
You've still got me.

01:17:27.161 --> 01:17:29.254
l'm not good for much, l know...

01:17:31.866 --> 01:17:33.663
...but l'll stand by you...

01:17:35.102 --> 01:17:36.831
...all the days of my life.

01:17:38.472 --> 01:17:40.133
l know you will.

01:17:42.977 --> 01:17:45.969
You don't know
what a comfort you are to me, Laurie.

01:17:51.185 --> 01:17:52.584
-Jo--
-No, don't say it.

01:17:52.653 --> 01:17:54.814
l will, and you must hear me.

01:17:55.089 --> 01:17:56.613
lt's no use, Jo.

01:17:56.757 --> 01:17:59.624
You've kept away from me
ever since l got back from college.

01:17:59.694 --> 01:18:03.528
l studied so hard
and l graduated with honors, all for you.

01:18:03.731 --> 01:18:06.757
-l know, and l'm so proud of you.
-Then won't you listen?

01:18:07.001 --> 01:18:07.990
Please.

01:18:11.439 --> 01:18:13.805
l've loved you ever since l've known you.

01:18:14.275 --> 01:18:15.640
l couldn't help it.

01:18:16.177 --> 01:18:18.645
l've tried to show it,
but you wouldn't let me.

01:18:18.813 --> 01:18:21.748
Now l'm going to make you hear it
and give me an answer...

01:18:21.849 --> 01:18:24.579
...for l just can't go on so any longer.

01:18:26.687 --> 01:18:29.383
l know l'm not half good enough for you.

01:18:29.557 --> 01:18:32.685
But if you love me,
you can make me anything you like.

01:18:33.561 --> 01:18:35.722
As though l'd change you, Laurie.

01:18:38.399 --> 01:18:42.768
You should marry some lovely,
accomplished girl who adores you.

01:18:42.970 --> 01:18:45.438
Someone who would grace
your beautiful home.

01:18:45.573 --> 01:18:50.203
l shouldn't.
l loathe elegant society and you like it.

01:18:50.645 --> 01:18:54.308
And you hate my scribbling
and l can't get on without it.

01:18:54.849 --> 01:18:56.282
And we should quarrel.

01:18:56.350 --> 01:18:58.875
-No, we shouldn't.
-Yes, we always have, you know.

01:18:59.053 --> 01:19:02.045
Everything would be horrid
if we were ever foolish enough to--

01:19:02.156 --> 01:19:05.455
Marry? No, it wouldn't, Jo.
lt would be heaven.

01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:09.218
Don't disappoint us, dear. Don't.
Everybody expects it.

01:19:09.730 --> 01:19:11.857
Grandfather has set his heart on it.

01:19:14.135 --> 01:19:17.070
And l just can't go on without you.

01:19:18.272 --> 01:19:21.264
Please, say you will.

01:19:24.278 --> 01:19:25.575
l can't.

01:19:27.648 --> 01:19:29.013
Laurie, l'm sorry.

01:19:30.551 --> 01:19:32.644
So desperately sorry.

01:19:38.325 --> 01:19:43.126
l'm so grateful to you,
and so proud and fond of you.

01:19:44.465 --> 01:19:47.491
l don't know why l can't love you
the way you want me to.

01:19:47.735 --> 01:19:51.694
l've tried, but l can't change the feeling...

01:19:53.407 --> 01:19:56.399
...and it would be a lie to say l do if l don't.

01:19:58.012 --> 01:19:59.639
Really truly, Jo?

01:20:01.816 --> 01:20:03.545
Really truly, dear.

01:20:06.454 --> 01:20:08.285
l don't think l'll ever marry.

01:20:09.356 --> 01:20:10.550
Yes, you will.

01:20:11.425 --> 01:20:14.417
You'll meet some good-for-nothing,
no-account idiot...

01:20:14.495 --> 01:20:17.862
...and you'll fall in love with him,
and work, live and die for him.

01:20:17.932 --> 01:20:20.730
l know you will. lt's your way.

01:20:21.302 --> 01:20:23.998
And l'll have to stand by and see it.

01:20:24.472 --> 01:20:26.565
Well, l'll be hanged if l do.

01:20:28.142 --> 01:20:29.336
Where are you going?

01:20:29.944 --> 01:20:32.310
To the devil, and l hope you'll be sorry.

01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:33.811
Laurie, please....

01:21:13.554 --> 01:21:15.545
Why aren't you in bed? lt's late.

01:21:18.325 --> 01:21:20.418
Mother, l want to go away.

01:21:21.195 --> 01:21:23.254
l mean, just for a little while.

01:21:23.430 --> 01:21:27.992
l don't know. l feel restless and anxious
to be doing something.

01:21:29.203 --> 01:21:32.195
l'd like to hop a little way
and try my wings.

01:21:32.873 --> 01:21:34.340
Where would you hop?

01:21:34.742 --> 01:21:35.766
To New York.

01:21:36.777 --> 01:21:38.677
l've thought about it a lot lately.

01:21:38.746 --> 01:21:39.974
You can spare me now.

01:21:40.047 --> 01:21:43.574
l could go to Mrs. Kirke's and help
with the children as part of my board.

01:21:43.651 --> 01:21:46.984
lt wouldn't cost much,
and l'd see and hear new things...

01:21:47.054 --> 01:21:49.818
...and get a lot of new ideas for my stories.

01:21:50.090 --> 01:21:51.489
l don't doubt it.

01:21:51.559 --> 01:21:54.619
Jo, nothing's happened
between you and Laurie?

01:21:58.766 --> 01:22:02.497
Don't be surprised, dear.
Mothers have to have sharp eyes...

01:22:02.870 --> 01:22:06.499
...especially when their daughters
keep their troubles to themselves.

01:22:06.574 --> 01:22:10.704
Oh, Marmee, l'd have told you,
only l thought it would blow over...

01:22:12.646 --> 01:22:16.013
...and it seemed kind of wrong
to tell Laurie's poor little secret.

01:22:16.717 --> 01:22:20.710
lt's only that he's got
a foolish romantic notion in his head...

01:22:21.121 --> 01:22:25.990
...and l think if l go away for a time,
he may get over it.

01:22:26.293 --> 01:22:27.521
l see.

01:22:28.829 --> 01:22:32.788
And how do you feel
about this ''foolish romantic notion''?

01:22:36.136 --> 01:22:39.628
l love him dearly as l always have.

01:22:42.576 --> 01:22:46.307
l feel as though
l've stabbed my dearest friend.

01:22:49.483 --> 01:22:52.179
And yet, l don't want to make a mistake.

01:22:53.988 --> 01:22:58.948
You're right, Jo. l think it would be
a good idea for both your sakes.

01:23:00.628 --> 01:23:02.528
Now, come to bed, dear.

01:23:03.030 --> 01:23:07.865
l'll talk to Father about it.
And if he agrees, we'll write to Mrs. Kirke.

01:23:13.140 --> 01:23:15.506
-Good night, dear.
-Good night, Marmee.

01:23:21.015 --> 01:23:24.542
Now, my dear,
l think l've told you everything...

01:23:24.852 --> 01:23:29.152
...and it will be a great load off my mind
knowing the children are safe with you.

01:23:29.890 --> 01:23:33.018
l'm very busy so l'll have Mamie
show you to your room.

01:23:33.627 --> 01:23:34.616
Mamie!

01:23:35.963 --> 01:23:39.399
l've given you a little inside room.
lt's all l had...

01:23:39.566 --> 01:23:42.558
...but it has a table
and you can use it for your writing.

01:23:42.636 --> 01:23:43.625
That's great.

01:23:43.837 --> 01:23:44.895
Mamie!

01:23:46.440 --> 01:23:49.568
You must come down here some
after dinner and be sociable.

01:23:49.643 --> 01:23:52.237
l promised your mother
l wouldn't let you be homesick...

01:23:52.313 --> 01:23:55.009
...and l have only the most refined people
in my house.

01:23:55.215 --> 01:23:56.204
Mamie!

01:23:56.350 --> 01:23:58.113
Here l am, Ms. Kirke.

01:23:58.185 --> 01:24:00.585
Mamie, this is Miss Josephine.

01:24:01.822 --> 01:24:04.518
Will you take her up to her room
and find the children?

01:24:04.725 --> 01:24:06.522
l'll see you later, my dear.

01:24:07.695 --> 01:24:09.595
Right this way, please.

01:24:09.797 --> 01:24:11.890
Children, children!

01:24:13.033 --> 01:24:16.935
They ain't a bad lot but, my stars,
they take a deal of handling.

01:24:17.871 --> 01:24:19.896
Jimmy! Kitty!

01:24:22.209 --> 01:24:23.836
You heard me.

01:24:27.514 --> 01:24:29.948
Come on out, l know where you are.

01:24:32.152 --> 01:24:35.144
The bear's going to eat my baby.
Save my poor baby.

01:24:42.629 --> 01:24:45.462
My baby! Don't eat my baby!

01:24:48.402 --> 01:24:51.098
Professor!

01:24:56.310 --> 01:24:58.244
l beg your pardon.

01:24:58.779 --> 01:25:01.179
Please. l'm so sorry.

01:25:02.549 --> 01:25:05.882
This is Miss Josephine
what's got you in charge now.

01:25:06.053 --> 01:25:07.350
-Hello.
-How do you do?

01:25:07.421 --> 01:25:10.584
-And this is Professor Bhaer.
-How do you do?

01:25:10.657 --> 01:25:13.524
-Come on, let's finish the game.
-l want to play some more.

01:25:13.594 --> 01:25:17.030
That is for Miss Josephine to say,
but we've frightened her already.

01:25:17.097 --> 01:25:20.931
Oh, no, but l didn't expect to meet
a grizzly bear in the upper hall.

01:25:22.536 --> 01:25:24.663
Mamie, wait.

01:25:25.139 --> 01:25:28.233
The back is too young
to carry such heavy loads.

01:25:29.510 --> 01:25:32.877
Come on, children, let's play soldiers.
Tina, you are the general.

01:25:33.180 --> 01:25:35.774
You're the captain. And here, Lieutenant.

01:25:36.583 --> 01:25:38.551
Forward march!

01:25:46.860 --> 01:25:49.556
He's such a lovely man.

01:25:50.030 --> 01:25:52.692
l know he must've been a gentleman
sometime or other...

01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:55.030
...but he's as poor as a church mouse now.

01:25:55.102 --> 01:25:56.694
What does he do?

01:25:57.738 --> 01:26:00.104
He's a professor, see?

01:26:00.274 --> 01:26:03.004
He learns them how they talk
in foreign countries.

01:26:03.077 --> 01:26:06.308
l don't know what good it does them
when they're living right here.

01:27:48.882 --> 01:27:52.477
Good evening, my little friend,
good evening.

01:27:52.753 --> 01:27:53.981
Please, don't stop.

01:27:55.155 --> 01:27:56.747
lt was beautiful.

01:27:57.090 --> 01:28:00.355
l've heard you play it often
and wanted to ask you what it was.

01:28:00.460 --> 01:28:02.690
l'd so like to send it to my little sister.

01:28:03.063 --> 01:28:07.022
<i>Nur wer die Sehnsucht kennt.</i>
The words are by Goethe.

01:28:08.001 --> 01:28:09.764
Do you speak German?

01:28:11.338 --> 01:28:15.502
Then l'd better give it to you in English.
Let's see now.

01:28:23.183 --> 01:28:27.517
''Only who knows what longing is

01:28:29.223 --> 01:28:32.989
''Can know what l suffer

01:28:36.697 --> 01:28:42.966
''Alone and parted far from joy
and gladness

01:28:55.082 --> 01:28:57.448
''My senses fail

01:28:59.286 --> 01:29:01.652
''A burning fire devours me

01:29:09.596 --> 01:29:11.962
''My senses fail

01:29:12.866 --> 01:29:15.232
''A burning fire devours me''

01:29:24.544 --> 01:29:26.273
l know how he felt.

01:29:26.613 --> 01:29:28.240
Tchaikovsky did, also.

01:29:28.915 --> 01:29:32.476
That is why he wrote this beautiful,
heartbreaking music.

01:29:33.553 --> 01:29:36.113
lf only l could write something like that.

01:29:37.124 --> 01:29:40.355
Something splendid
that would set other hearts on fire.

01:29:40.827 --> 01:29:42.624
That is genius.

01:29:44.498 --> 01:29:47.092
Do you wish to write, my little friend?

01:29:47.234 --> 01:29:49.134
Yes, that's my longing.

01:29:49.202 --> 01:29:51.602
l've sold two stories already
since l've been here.

01:29:51.672 --> 01:29:56.006
That is very good.
l'd like to read them. May l?

01:29:56.476 --> 01:29:59.843
Would you?
l'd so like to know your opinion.

01:29:59.980 --> 01:30:05.043
l would be very happy.
You have the ardent spirit. l like that.

01:30:12.426 --> 01:30:15.122
What shall l ask for at the music shop?

01:30:22.636 --> 01:30:25.332
l think l'd better write it down for you.

01:30:26.473 --> 01:30:29.135
Well, now,
here is a teacher without a pencil.

01:30:30.110 --> 01:30:32.476
Let me sew that button for you
before you lose it.

01:30:32.546 --> 01:30:34.446
No, l sew on buttons.

01:30:34.514 --> 01:30:36.243
Not very well, evidently.

01:30:37.417 --> 01:30:38.509
Well.

01:30:46.660 --> 01:30:49.322
-Who was Goldilocks, a little girl?
-Yes.

01:30:49.429 --> 01:30:51.989
''And she...

01:30:52.232 --> 01:30:56.168
''...went into their house...

01:30:56.837 --> 01:30:59.601
''...and saw three chairs.

01:31:00.507 --> 01:31:02.668
''Three chairs.

01:31:02.743 --> 01:31:07.146
''One was the baby one,
one was the daddy one...

01:31:07.347 --> 01:31:09.474
''...and one was the mommy one.

01:31:10.784 --> 01:31:12.775
''So she sat down in the big one....

01:31:13.019 --> 01:31:14.646
''And it was too hard.''

01:31:16.089 --> 01:31:18.819
Miss Josephine,
you're to go to the parlor right away.

01:31:18.892 --> 01:31:20.257
Someone to see you.

01:31:20.327 --> 01:31:22.727
-Who is it?
-l can't tell you. lt's a surprise.

01:31:22.863 --> 01:31:25.058
All right, children, that will be all for today.

01:31:25.132 --> 01:31:28.431
Now run along and wash your hands
and faces for tea.

01:31:28.502 --> 01:31:31.767
-l'll finish the story tomorrow.
-All right.

01:31:32.739 --> 01:31:35.799
-Who is it, Mamie?
-l can't tell you. lt's a surprise.

01:31:35.976 --> 01:31:37.841
Are these some of your new stories?

01:31:40.814 --> 01:31:41.906
Oh, they look...

01:31:41.982 --> 01:31:44.678
...creepier than <i>The Duke's Daughter</i>.
Can l read them?

01:31:44.785 --> 01:31:46.548
Yes, if you want to.

01:31:50.624 --> 01:31:56.563
'' <i>The Place of the Coventrys</i>
or <i>The Secret of a Guilty Heart</i>...

01:31:57.431 --> 01:31:59.331
''...by Josephine March.''

01:32:07.240 --> 01:32:08.764
Then it's true.

01:32:08.975 --> 01:32:10.704
-Amy!
-Darling!

01:32:11.645 --> 01:32:13.408
-Aunt March!
-Josephine.

01:32:13.580 --> 01:32:14.911
l'm so glad to see you.

01:32:14.981 --> 01:32:16.778
What took you so long to get down?

01:32:16.850 --> 01:32:18.010
Tell me everything.

01:32:18.084 --> 01:32:19.381
We can't stop now.

01:32:19.453 --> 01:32:22.479
We've got to get to the shipping office
before it closes.

01:32:22.889 --> 01:32:26.723
Shipping office? Aunt March, Europe?

01:32:28.061 --> 01:32:30.029
l'm taking Amy with me.

01:32:32.866 --> 01:32:35.300
Well, maybe you can go next time.

01:32:36.503 --> 01:32:37.834
Next time?

01:32:41.675 --> 01:32:44.337
Tell me, is Meg all right?

01:32:44.878 --> 01:32:46.607
And Marmee and Father?

01:32:46.746 --> 01:32:47.872
And how's my Beth?

01:32:48.014 --> 01:32:51.711
She's better again,
but she isn't rosy as she used to be.

01:32:51.918 --> 01:32:55.081
Oh, my poor Beth.
Why doesn't she get strong?

01:32:55.322 --> 01:32:56.755
And Laurie?

01:32:56.990 --> 01:32:59.151
Didn't you see them when they were here?

01:32:59.292 --> 01:33:02.659
He and his grandfather
have been in Europe for weeks.

01:33:04.531 --> 01:33:06.294
Laurie in New York?

01:33:07.133 --> 01:33:09.124
And didn't come to see me?

01:33:10.203 --> 01:33:13.570
l'm sure you can't blame him
after the way you picked up...

01:33:13.673 --> 01:33:16.972
...and trotted off without so much
as saying goodbye to any of us.

01:33:17.911 --> 01:33:20.573
l think you've treated everybody
shamefully.

01:33:21.214 --> 01:33:22.806
Come along, Amy.

01:33:23.717 --> 01:33:27.448
Jo, dear, l wish it were you.

01:33:28.188 --> 01:33:30.247
l know how you've always longed to go.

01:33:30.323 --> 01:33:33.190
No, darling. lt's your reward.

01:33:33.260 --> 01:33:35.854
You've always done sweet things
to please Aunt March.

01:33:35.929 --> 01:33:38.557
Think of all the wonderful things
you are going to see:

01:33:38.632 --> 01:33:41.726
The Turners,
the Raphaels and the Leonardos.

01:33:43.270 --> 01:33:46.034
You seem to forget
waiting cabs cost money.

01:33:46.506 --> 01:33:49.066
That's the trouble with folks
who never had anything.

01:33:49.142 --> 01:33:51.007
Easy come, easy go.

01:33:51.645 --> 01:33:53.636
We'll be right back, Josephine.

01:33:54.748 --> 01:33:56.181
Goodbye, darling.

01:34:27.047 --> 01:34:29.538
Miss Josephine?

01:34:31.284 --> 01:34:32.581
Yes, Professor Bhaer.

01:34:32.686 --> 01:34:35.814
l have read your stories
and l would like to return them to you.

01:34:35.989 --> 01:34:38.082
Will you please come in?

01:34:38.291 --> 01:34:39.849
Yes, thank you.

01:34:45.699 --> 01:34:47.360
Did you like them?

01:34:47.634 --> 01:34:51.092
Well, Miss March, l must be honest.
l was disappointed.

01:34:52.172 --> 01:34:54.504
Why do you write
such artificial characters...

01:34:54.674 --> 01:34:59.441
...such artificial plots, villains,
murderers and such women?

01:34:59.579 --> 01:35:01.547
Why don't you write a....

01:35:06.820 --> 01:35:10.256
Miss March, please. l am so sorry.

01:35:12.759 --> 01:35:16.320
l didn't want to hurt you.
l wanted to help you.

01:35:16.796 --> 01:35:19.424
What a blundering fool l am.

01:35:21.935 --> 01:35:23.926
lt isn't that.

01:35:24.904 --> 01:35:27.338
Please, don't pay any attention to me.

01:35:27.807 --> 01:35:30.640
Forgive me, please. Come, sit down.

01:35:32.479 --> 01:35:33.468
Forgive me.

01:35:33.546 --> 01:35:37.710
No, it's just that everything seems
to come at once.

01:35:39.619 --> 01:35:42.782
The rest doesn't matter so much.
l can bear that.

01:35:44.190 --> 01:35:47.887
But Laurie, l can never get over Laurie.

01:35:48.962 --> 01:35:51.897
<i>Herr</i> Laurie, your friend.

01:35:53.733 --> 01:35:55.997
-Something has happened to him?
-Yes.

01:35:56.736 --> 01:35:59.796
No, something has happened to me.

01:36:02.342 --> 01:36:07.837
He came to New York
and he didn't even come to see me.

01:36:09.983 --> 01:36:12.076
What a fool he must be.

01:36:14.621 --> 01:36:18.148
No, it's my fault. But l thought that....

01:36:18.491 --> 01:36:20.982
What does it matter what l thought?

01:36:21.094 --> 01:36:23.858
l've made a mess of it
as l do of everything.

01:36:24.230 --> 01:36:28.496
But l have tried and when l think
of Aunt March taking Amy to Europe...

01:36:28.568 --> 01:36:30.900
...when she always promised
she'd take me...

01:36:31.204 --> 01:36:33.502
...not that l begrudge Amy the trip, but....

01:36:33.673 --> 01:36:35.937
l suppose that's just what l am doing.

01:36:36.009 --> 01:36:39.501
That trip to Europe
that you so looked forward to.

01:36:39.579 --> 01:36:42.946
That is too bad.
That is a cruel disappointment, l know.

01:36:43.016 --> 01:36:44.916
On top of it, that stupid professor.

01:36:44.984 --> 01:36:47.179
He comes blundering
and makes things worse.

01:36:47.253 --> 01:36:51.519
No. lf l can't stand the truth,
l'm not worth anything.

01:36:52.325 --> 01:36:55.385
l didn't think those stories
were so very good.

01:36:55.662 --> 01:36:57.129
But you see...

01:36:58.364 --> 01:37:01.265
... <i>The Duke's Daughter</i>
paid the butcher's bill...

01:37:01.501 --> 01:37:04.834
...and the <i>Curse of the Coventrys</i>
was the blessing of the Marches...

01:37:05.171 --> 01:37:07.662
...because it sent Marmee and Beth
to the seashore.

01:37:07.807 --> 01:37:09.832
Yes, that is what l have thought.

01:37:10.376 --> 01:37:14.676
And then l have said to myself:
''l maybe have no right to speak.''

01:37:15.915 --> 01:37:19.908
But then again, l said to myself:
''l maybe have no right to be silent.''

01:37:20.286 --> 01:37:23.084
Miss March, you have talent.

01:37:23.323 --> 01:37:26.520
-Do you really think so?
-Otherwise l could not say.

01:37:26.626 --> 01:37:27.854
And you know that.

01:37:28.328 --> 01:37:31.889
And l say to you,
''Sweep mud on the street first...

01:37:32.465 --> 01:37:34.626
''...before you are false to that talent.''

01:37:35.668 --> 01:37:37.158
Say to yourself:

01:37:37.337 --> 01:37:42.297
''l will never write one single line
which l have not heard in my own heart.''

01:37:43.610 --> 01:37:46.044
Say to yourself, ''While l am young...

01:37:46.112 --> 01:37:50.378
''...l will write these simple,
beautiful things that l understand now.

01:37:51.017 --> 01:37:56.512
''Maybe later, when l am a little older
and l have felt life more...

01:37:56.756 --> 01:37:59.691
''...then l will write
about these poor wretches...

01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:04.392
''...but l will make them live and breathe
like my Shakespeare did.''

01:38:05.398 --> 01:38:08.492
-Will you do that, my little friend?
-Yes, l'll try.

01:38:09.302 --> 01:38:12.100
But l don't think l'll ever be a Shakespeare,
do you?

01:38:13.673 --> 01:38:15.868
But you can be a Josephine March.

01:38:17.110 --> 01:38:20.079
And l assure you that is plenty.

01:38:20.947 --> 01:38:24.542
And now,
don't be disappointed about that trip.

01:38:26.119 --> 01:38:28.087
-Here.
-Peppermint, good.

01:38:29.322 --> 01:38:32.382
Those of us who have been
all over the Old World...

01:38:32.725 --> 01:38:35.216
...can find many things in the New...

01:38:36.362 --> 01:38:39.331
...that are beautiful and young.

01:38:48.174 --> 01:38:50.438
Miss March,
it would give me great pleasure...

01:38:50.510 --> 01:38:54.173
...if l could show you some
of these things while you are here.

01:38:54.247 --> 01:38:56.215
lf you would care to have so.

01:38:57.917 --> 01:38:59.248
Thank you.

01:39:02.722 --> 01:39:05.885
Then you are not angry
with the blundering professor...

01:39:05.959 --> 01:39:08.359
...who takes the wrong times
for his lectures?

01:39:08.728 --> 01:39:10.252
How could l be?

01:39:13.900 --> 01:39:16.460
<i>Auf Wiedersehen</i>, my little friend.

01:40:03.850 --> 01:40:05.181
Did you really like it?

01:40:05.251 --> 01:40:07.617
-l never had such a....
-Happy, my little friend.

01:40:07.687 --> 01:40:11.350
She was divine.
l don't want to be a writer anymore.

01:40:11.658 --> 01:40:15.094
l want to be a wonderful singer
and thrill thousands of people...

01:40:15.161 --> 01:40:19.154
...so that they cheer
and throw flowers at me like that.

01:40:20.066 --> 01:40:21.590
Bravo. Bravo.

01:40:23.336 --> 01:40:25.463
But l wouldn't make up my mind so soon...

01:40:25.538 --> 01:40:28.371
...because at the art museum
you wanted to be a sculptress...

01:40:28.441 --> 01:40:30.773
...at the circus you thought
the bareback rider...

01:40:30.843 --> 01:40:33.004
...was the most beautiful thing
in the world.

01:40:33.079 --> 01:40:35.104
l know, but to sing like that!

01:40:44.424 --> 01:40:46.016
l forgot.

01:40:46.159 --> 01:40:48.627
Something inside me tonight
makes me want to shout.

01:40:48.695 --> 01:40:49.821
What would you shout?

01:40:49.896 --> 01:40:54.959
l'd say, ''Look at me, world.
l'm Jo March and l'm so happy.''

01:40:55.134 --> 01:40:57.329
My little friend, you are happy.

01:40:58.037 --> 01:41:02.497
You haven't missed much lately
your home and your old friends?

01:41:02.575 --> 01:41:04.600
But you're responsible for that.

01:41:05.745 --> 01:41:08.077
Maybe they haven't missed me
so much either.

01:41:08.147 --> 01:41:10.809
They're so busy with Meg
and those blessed babies.

01:41:10.917 --> 01:41:13.078
Yes, how are those remarkable twins?

01:41:13.186 --> 01:41:15.711
Wonderful. Meg's so proud of them.

01:41:17.223 --> 01:41:19.157
Have you heard from Europe?

01:41:19.392 --> 01:41:22.054
Nearly every boat
brings a letter from Amy.

01:41:22.128 --> 01:41:24.255
And your friend...

01:41:24.664 --> 01:41:26.723
...<i>Herr</i> Laurie, have you heard from him?

01:41:27.500 --> 01:41:30.958
Only through Amy. They met at Vichy
and had a wonderful time together.

01:41:31.971 --> 01:41:34.804
Miss March, l am bold to ask a favor.

01:41:40.013 --> 01:41:42.243
Would you give me the address
of your father?

01:41:42.415 --> 01:41:44.576
l wish to write him and ask him something.

01:41:46.085 --> 01:41:48.576
Why, yes.
He'd be so happy to hear from you.

01:41:48.855 --> 01:41:51.380
They almost know you.
l've told them all about you.

01:41:51.457 --> 01:41:53.789
And they always ask after you
in their letters.

01:41:53.860 --> 01:41:55.919
-Really?
-Yes, now l'll show you.

01:41:56.696 --> 01:41:58.186
This is so nice.

01:42:07.473 --> 01:42:08.804
Not l hope....

01:42:10.810 --> 01:42:13.176
lt's Beth. She's....

01:42:16.049 --> 01:42:18.517
l must go at once.

01:42:18.785 --> 01:42:23.745
My friend, can l do something for you?
l'm sure there is something l can do.

01:42:25.391 --> 01:42:29.418
No, there's nothing. Thank you.

01:42:35.101 --> 01:42:36.728
Oh, Jo...

01:42:37.537 --> 01:42:39.266
...to think you're home.

01:42:40.606 --> 01:42:42.938
lf Amy were here, we'd all be together.

01:42:45.311 --> 01:42:47.370
She'll be home in the spring, darling.

01:42:49.048 --> 01:42:53.280
And l'm going to have you all well
and rosy by then.

01:43:01.494 --> 01:43:05.555
Poor Jo, you mustn't be afraid.

01:43:09.435 --> 01:43:11.266
Doesn't that sound funny...

01:43:12.004 --> 01:43:15.633
...me saying that to you
when you've always said it to me?

01:43:19.479 --> 01:43:21.276
You've always reminded me...

01:43:22.615 --> 01:43:26.949
...of a seagull, strong and wild...

01:43:27.753 --> 01:43:29.846
...and fond of the wind and the storm...

01:43:30.823 --> 01:43:33.485
...dreaming of flying far out to sea.

01:43:35.728 --> 01:43:39.459
And Mother always said
that l was like a little cricket...

01:43:41.300 --> 01:43:43.666
...chirping contentedly on the hearth...

01:43:44.837 --> 01:43:49.035
...never able to bear the thought
of leaving home.

01:43:50.943 --> 01:43:52.535
But now...

01:43:54.514 --> 01:43:55.674
...it's different.

01:43:59.619 --> 01:44:01.314
l can't express it very well.

01:44:01.921 --> 01:44:05.015
l shouldn't try to, to anyone but you...

01:44:06.692 --> 01:44:10.685
...because l can't speak out
to anyone but my Jo.

01:44:15.735 --> 01:44:17.259
l'm not afraid anymore.

01:44:19.338 --> 01:44:25.743
l'm learning that l don't lose you,
that you'll be more to me than ever...

01:44:27.013 --> 01:44:30.710
...and nothing can part us,
though it seems to.

01:44:37.924 --> 01:44:38.913
Oh, Jo.

01:44:40.826 --> 01:44:44.819
l think l'll be homesick for you
even in heaven.

01:45:20.666 --> 01:45:22.031
The little loves.

01:45:23.736 --> 01:45:26.728
-l'm afraid they're tiring you.
-Oh, no.

01:45:28.174 --> 01:45:30.870
lt's time for my little regiment
to take its nap.

01:45:47.126 --> 01:45:49.686
-They're sweet.
-Yes.

01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:56.158
l think l can sleep now.

01:46:01.007 --> 01:46:04.135
Look, Jo, my birds.

01:46:05.077 --> 01:46:06.806
They got back in time.

01:46:14.954 --> 01:46:18.321
-Bethie!
-Mother!

01:46:20.660 --> 01:46:21.820
My daughter!

01:46:21.894 --> 01:46:23.657
Bethie!

01:46:29.335 --> 01:46:30.700
Oh, Marmee.

01:46:33.773 --> 01:46:35.400
We mustn't cry.

01:46:36.676 --> 01:46:39.338
We must be glad she's well at last.

01:46:40.112 --> 01:46:41.773
No, Marmee, don't cry.

01:46:56.395 --> 01:46:58.920
lf only there were another boat
leaving sooner.

01:46:58.998 --> 01:47:03.059
Now, my dear, you've been so brave,
you must be patient.

01:47:03.803 --> 01:47:06.636
We're going back on the very first boat.

01:47:07.873 --> 01:47:11.138
l still think you should obey
your mother and stay.

01:47:11.510 --> 01:47:15.640
l know. But l'm sick for home, Aunt March.
l hate all this now.

01:47:16.382 --> 01:47:20.443
lf it weren't for this, l'd have been there,
at least to say goodbye.

01:47:27.660 --> 01:47:30.185
Laurie, l knew you'd come.

01:47:31.731 --> 01:47:33.164
My child!

01:47:33.733 --> 01:47:35.394
Mr. Laurence!

01:47:36.068 --> 01:47:40.164
Amy, we were in Germany,
and Marmee's letter had to be forwarded...

01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:43.308
...but l came the moment l got it
because....

01:47:43.776 --> 01:47:47.109
Well, you must comfort me now, too.

01:47:53.786 --> 01:47:57.517
l'm so thankful you're here.
l haven't known what to do with the child.

01:47:57.857 --> 01:47:59.791
Perhaps you can persuade her to stay.

01:48:04.597 --> 01:48:07.395
-The elegant young matron.
-Hello, Jo, dear.

01:48:07.466 --> 01:48:09.991
l've Sally Moffat's carriage.
l'm making some calls.

01:48:10.069 --> 01:48:12.663
You want me to mind the demons
while you're gone?

01:48:12.738 --> 01:48:14.365
No, l want you to go with me.

01:48:14.540 --> 01:48:17.202
Jo, dear. lt's a lovely day
and l want to talk to you.

01:48:17.276 --> 01:48:20.109
Talk to me now.
You know l can't bear calls.

01:48:24.216 --> 01:48:27.185
-How's your story coming?
-Sent it off yesterday.

01:48:27.553 --> 01:48:30.920
-Without us reading it?
-You can read it when they send it back.

01:48:33.225 --> 01:48:35.318
-l had a letter from Amy.
-So did Marmee.

01:48:36.162 --> 01:48:39.222
They're in Valrosa now
and she says it's paradise.

01:48:41.801 --> 01:48:43.792
Jo, l'd like to ask you something.

01:48:45.971 --> 01:48:48.064
l've been wondering...

01:48:48.707 --> 01:48:50.504
...how would you feel...

01:48:51.677 --> 01:48:55.545
...if you should hear that your Laurie
was learning to care for somebody else?

01:48:59.318 --> 01:49:01.013
Meg, who?

01:49:03.556 --> 01:49:04.523
Amy?

01:49:07.827 --> 01:49:11.627
l don't know. l can't be sure.
l'm only reading between the lines.

01:49:16.035 --> 01:49:17.935
Then you wouldn't mind?

01:49:18.237 --> 01:49:20.432
No, Meg. How could l?

01:49:21.540 --> 01:49:23.735
l think it would be wonderful, don't you?

01:49:23.809 --> 01:49:25.800
Yes, but l wasn't quite sure.

01:49:27.847 --> 01:49:29.678
Forgive me, dear...

01:49:30.850 --> 01:49:35.412
...but l have so much
and you seem so alone.

01:49:36.989 --> 01:49:39.617
l thought lately
that maybe if Laurie came back--

01:49:39.725 --> 01:49:41.955
No, dear. lt's better as it is.

01:49:42.061 --> 01:49:45.360
And l'm glad if he and Amy
are learning to love each other.

01:49:46.098 --> 01:49:47.998
You're right about one thing though.

01:49:48.100 --> 01:49:52.161
l am lonely and maybe
if Laurie had come back...

01:49:53.005 --> 01:49:54.632
...l might've said yes.

01:49:54.907 --> 01:49:58.104
Not because l love him any differently,
but because...

01:49:59.311 --> 01:50:04.146
...it means more to me now
to be loved than it used to.

01:50:38.484 --> 01:50:39.678
Laurie.

01:50:40.786 --> 01:50:42.947
Oh, my Laurie!

01:50:44.924 --> 01:50:47.688
Jo, dear. Are you glad to see me?

01:50:48.827 --> 01:50:50.089
Glad?

01:50:50.729 --> 01:50:56.065
My blessed boy!
Words can't express my gladness.

01:50:56.368 --> 01:50:57.665
And where's your wife?

01:50:57.736 --> 01:51:00.671
They all stopped in at Meg's,
but l couldn't wait to see you.

01:51:00.739 --> 01:51:02.206
They'll be along presently.

01:51:02.274 --> 01:51:04.538
Let me look at you.

01:51:06.645 --> 01:51:09.773
Don't l look like a married man
and the head of a family?

01:51:10.516 --> 01:51:15.920
Not a bit, and you never will, although
you have grown bigger and bonnier.

01:51:16.589 --> 01:51:20.889
But you're the same scapegrace as ever,
despite that very elegant mustache.

01:51:20.960 --> 01:51:25.329
-You can't fool me.
-You have to treat me with more respect.

01:51:28.701 --> 01:51:33.832
Jo, dear, l want to say one thing,
then we'll put it by forever.

01:51:34.006 --> 01:51:36.270
No, Laurie, please.

01:51:37.543 --> 01:51:42.037
l think it was always meant to be,
you and Amy.

01:51:43.082 --> 01:51:46.108
lt would have come about naturally
if only you'd waited.

01:51:46.819 --> 01:51:48.878
As you tried to make me understand.

01:51:49.521 --> 01:51:51.284
But you never could be patient.

01:51:54.259 --> 01:51:57.751
So then we can go back
to the happy old times?

01:51:57.830 --> 01:52:00.799
The way you wanted it,
when we first knew one another.

01:52:04.503 --> 01:52:07.700
We never can be boy and girl again, Laurie.

01:52:08.440 --> 01:52:11.102
Those happy old times can't come back.

01:52:12.311 --> 01:52:14.074
We shouldn't expect them to.

01:52:15.280 --> 01:52:18.977
We're man and woman now,
we can't be playmates any longer.

01:52:20.552 --> 01:52:25.512
But we can be brother and sister,
to love and help one another...

01:52:25.824 --> 01:52:28.918
...all the rest of our lives, can't we, Laurie?

01:52:33.866 --> 01:52:35.299
There they are.

01:52:35.668 --> 01:52:37.329
You look very well, Aunt March.

01:52:37.403 --> 01:52:40.895
After the money spent on my rheumatism,
l come home on a day like this.

01:52:41.073 --> 01:52:44.474
Heaven's to Betsy. lf she ain't dressed
in silk from head to foot.

01:52:44.777 --> 01:52:47.371
Where is she? Where is Jo?

01:52:49.348 --> 01:52:51.543
-Jo!
-Amy!

01:52:51.684 --> 01:52:53.379
Doesn't she look marvelous, Jo?

01:53:03.128 --> 01:53:06.427
l'll never forgive myself
for staying away so long...

01:53:06.532 --> 01:53:09.968
...and leaving you
to bear everything all alone.

01:53:10.269 --> 01:53:11.531
Darling.

01:53:14.406 --> 01:53:19.036
To think that only yesterday we were
pulling our hair and buttoning pinafores.

01:53:19.111 --> 01:53:22.478
And now she's a grown-up married lady
with a bustle.

01:53:28.954 --> 01:53:31.582
You must be famished.
l'll help Hannah with the tea.

01:53:31.657 --> 01:53:35.855
No, you won't, Marmee.
You'll sit right here. l'll help Hannah.

01:53:43.435 --> 01:53:47.337
lt's fun, isn't it, Bethie?
Now that we're all together again.

01:53:50.576 --> 01:53:53.977
Oh, dear. l've got to get some milk.
l haven't enough for my babies.

01:53:54.046 --> 01:53:54.808
l'll go.

01:53:54.880 --> 01:53:57.508
-But it's raining cats and dogs.
-l love it.

01:53:57.716 --> 01:54:00.708
Sakes alive! There's the front doorbell.

01:54:09.027 --> 01:54:11.825
-ls this the residence of Miss March?
-Why, yes.

01:54:11.930 --> 01:54:13.488
-Miss Josephine March?
-Yes.

01:54:13.766 --> 01:54:15.199
May l speak with her?

01:54:15.267 --> 01:54:18.134
She's out,
but l'm expecting her back any minute.

01:54:18.203 --> 01:54:20.194
-Won't you come in?
-Thank you.

01:54:21.173 --> 01:54:23.869
No, thank you. She has guests, no.

01:54:24.510 --> 01:54:26.171
Thank you very much.

01:54:27.279 --> 01:54:33.115
But will you please give this to her
and tell her Professor Bhaer left it?

01:54:33.919 --> 01:54:34.851
Thank you.

01:54:35.020 --> 01:54:37.318
Professor Bhaer. Thank you very much.

01:54:38.791 --> 01:54:41.191
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

01:54:59.678 --> 01:55:02.010
-<i>Herr</i> Professor.
-My little friend.

01:55:03.015 --> 01:55:05.245
l was just here to leave your book.

01:55:05.617 --> 01:55:09.314
l wanted to tell you my friend published it,
and he has great hopes.

01:55:09.488 --> 01:55:11.513
-He thinks--
-Never mind what he thinks.

01:55:11.590 --> 01:55:12.682
Did you like it?

01:55:12.758 --> 01:55:17.218
My little friend, it has such truth,
such simple beauty.

01:55:17.296 --> 01:55:21.562
ln English quick,
l cannot tell you what it gives my heart.

01:55:21.633 --> 01:55:23.760
But you were going without telling me.

01:55:23.836 --> 01:55:26.634
lf l hadn't come back,
l never would've seen you again.

01:55:27.039 --> 01:55:30.167
-Come, you're getting wet.
-l couldn't intrude. You have guests.

01:55:30.242 --> 01:55:31.709
No, only my family.

01:55:31.910 --> 01:55:33.468
My sister has just come home.

01:55:33.545 --> 01:55:36.070
She is married to that boy l told you about.

01:55:36.248 --> 01:55:38.182
-<i>Herr</i> Laurie?
-Yes.

01:55:38.250 --> 01:55:41.276
This is the first time
we've all been together for a long time.

01:55:41.353 --> 01:55:43.150
Please, just one moment before....

01:55:43.222 --> 01:55:45.156
l had a wish to ask you something.

01:55:45.858 --> 01:55:46.847
Would you....

01:55:49.127 --> 01:55:51.220
l have no courage to think that....

01:55:51.964 --> 01:55:54.398
But could l dare hope that....

01:55:56.034 --> 01:55:59.333
l know l shouldn't make so free as to ask.

01:56:01.106 --> 01:56:06.100
l have nothing to give but my heart so full
and these empty hands.

01:56:08.013 --> 01:56:10.277
Not empty now.

01:56:11.583 --> 01:56:13.346
Heart's dearest!

01:56:21.827 --> 01:56:23.294
Welcome home.
