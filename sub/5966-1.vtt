WEBVTT

02:55.817 --> 02:58.342
Forward march!

04:30.311 --> 04:32.836
I'm requesting-

04:32.914 --> 04:37.044
Captain, I'd like to request
that it be me who's the attorney-

04:37.118 --> 04:39.882
That it be myself who’s assigned.

04:39.954 --> 04:42.787
No, I'd like to request
that it be I who am assigned-

04:44.358 --> 04:46.519
"That it be I who am assigned"?

04:46.594 --> 04:49.927
That's good.
That's confidence-inspiring.

04:49.997 --> 04:51.931
Good grammar there.

04:51.999 --> 04:54.194
Captain, I'd like to request...

04:54.268 --> 04:57.760
that I be the attorney assigned.

05:00.041 --> 05:02.441
I'm Lieutenant Commander Galloway
here to see Captain West.

05:02.510 --> 05:04.444
Go right in, Commander.
They're expecting you.

05:04.512 --> 05:05.945
Thank you.

05:09.517 --> 05:11.451
-Jo, come on in.
- Thank you, sir.

05:12.587 --> 05:15.488
Captain West,
this is Lieutenant Commander Galloway.

05:15.556 --> 05:17.922
-Jo, you know Commander Lawrence.
- Yes, sir.

05:17.992 --> 05:20.153
Captain, I appreciate
you seeing me on such short notice.

05:20.228 --> 05:22.788
- Would you like to sit down?
- I'm fine, sir.

05:22.864 --> 05:25.332
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

05:25.399 --> 05:27.594
I understand we had some trouble
over the weekend down in Cuba?

05:27.668 --> 05:30.967
Yes, sir.
This past Friday, two Marines-

05:31.038 --> 05:34.997
a Lance Corporal Harold Dawson
and a Private Louden Downey-

05:35.076 --> 05:39.274
entered the barracks room of a P.F.C.
William Santiago and assaulted him.

05:39.347 --> 05:42.839
Santiago died at the base hospital
approximately an hour later.

05:42.917 --> 05:46.444
The N.I.S. Agent who took
Dawson and Downey's statements...

05:46.520 --> 05:48.818
maintains they were trying
to prevent Santiago...

05:48.890 --> 05:51.723
from naming Dawson
in a fence line shooting incident.

05:51.792 --> 05:55.558
They're scheduled to have a hearing
down in Cuba this afternoon at 1600.

05:55.630 --> 05:57.564
- What's the problem?
- Dawson and Downey...

05:57.632 --> 06:01.966
are both recruiting poster Marines,
and Santiago was known to be a screw-up.

06:02.036 --> 06:04.800
I was thinking it sounded an awful lot
like a Code Red.

06:05.606 --> 06:07.164
Christ.

06:07.241 --> 06:10.904
Sir, I'd like to have them moved
up to Washington and assigned counsel-

06:10.978 --> 06:13.276
someone who can really
look into this-

06:13.347 --> 06:15.713
someone who possesses
not only the legal skill...

06:15.783 --> 06:18.718
but a familiarity
with the inner workings of the military.

06:18.786 --> 06:21.277
In short, Captain,
I'd like to suggest that...

06:21.355 --> 06:23.323
I be the one who that-

06:23.391 --> 06:27.054
that it be me who is assigned
to represent them...

06:27.128 --> 06:28.561
myself.

06:30.631 --> 06:33.156
Commander Galloway, why don’t you
get yourself a cup of coffee?

06:33.234 --> 06:35.225
Thank you, sir. I'm fine.

06:35.303 --> 06:38.500
I'd like you to leave the room so
we can talk about you behind your back.

06:38.572 --> 06:40.506
Certainly, sir.

06:47.281 --> 06:50.341
I thought this Code Red shit
wasn't going on anymore.

06:50.418 --> 06:53.512
With the Marines at Gitmo, who knows
what the hell goes on down there?

06:53.587 --> 06:55.555
We better find out
before the rest of the world does.

06:55.623 --> 06:57.648
Damn thing could get messy.

06:57.725 --> 07:00.250
All right,
what about this Commander Galloway?

07:00.328 --> 07:03.456
She's been working a desk
in Internal Affairs...

07:03.531 --> 07:05.465
for a little over a year now.

07:05.533 --> 07:08.525
- Before that?
- Disposed of three cases in two years.

07:08.602 --> 07:11.435
Three cases in two years?
Who's she handling, the Rosenbergs?

07:11.505 --> 07:14.030
- She's not cut out for litigation.
- She's a hell of an investigator.

07:14.108 --> 07:17.600
In Internal Affairs she can crawl up
a lawyer's ass with the best of them.

07:17.678 --> 07:21.512
- But when it comes to trial work-
- I know. All passion, no street smarts.

07:21.582 --> 07:23.516
Bring her back in.

07:33.995 --> 07:36.964
Commander, we're gonna have the
defendants moved up here in the morning.

07:37.031 --> 07:40.194
- Thank you, sir.
- Division will assign them counsel.

07:41.135 --> 07:45.629
-But not me.
-From what I get from your colleagues...

07:45.706 --> 07:48.038
you're much too valuable in your
present assignment to be wasted...

07:48.109 --> 07:50.202
in what I'm sure will boil down
to a five-minute plea bargain...

07:50.277 --> 07:52.211
and a week's worth of paperwork.

07:52.279 --> 07:54.406
Sir, I think there might be
more involved than that.

07:54.482 --> 07:55.915
Don't worry about it.

07:55.983 --> 07:58.884
I promise you Division will assign
the right man for the job.

07:59.320 --> 08:01.288
All right. Let's go.
Let's get two.

08:02.857 --> 08:05.052
- Sorry.
- Nothing to be sorry about, Sherby.

08:05.126 --> 08:07.321
You just look the ball
into your glove.

08:07.395 --> 08:08.828
Shooting two.

08:10.631 --> 08:12.599
- Sorry.
- You gotta trust me, Sherby.

08:12.666 --> 08:16.397
Keep your eyes open, your chances of
catching it increase by a factor often.

08:16.470 --> 08:18.335
- Kaffee.
- Let's try it again.

08:19.507 --> 08:21.498
Dave, you seem distraught.

08:21.575 --> 08:24.339
We were supposed to meet 15 minutes ago
about the McDermott case.

08:24.412 --> 08:27.108
You're stalling on this thing.
Now we either do it now...

08:27.181 --> 08:30.776
or, no kidding, Kaffee, I'm gonna
hang your boy from a fucking yardarm!

08:30.851 --> 08:34.810
Yardarm? Sherby, does the Navy
still hang people from yardarms?

08:34.889 --> 08:36.356
I don't think so.

08:36.424 --> 08:39.757
Dave, Sherby doesn't think the Navy
hangs people from yardarms anymore.

08:39.827 --> 08:43.194
I'm gonna charge him with possession
and being under the influence on duty.

08:43.264 --> 08:47.428
You plead guilty, I'll recommend 30 days
in the brig with loss of rank and pay.

08:47.501 --> 08:50.470
It was oregano, Dave.
It was $10 worth of oregano.

08:50.538 --> 08:52.472
Yeah, well, your client thought
it was marijuana.

08:52.540 --> 08:55.270
My client's a moron.
That's not against the law.

08:55.342 --> 08:58.709
Kaffee, I got people to answer to
just like you do. I'm gonna charge him.

08:58.779 --> 09:01.009
With what,
possession of a condiment?

09:01.082 --> 09:03.642
- Kaffee.
- I tried to help you out of this...

09:03.717 --> 09:06.447
but if you ask for jail time,
I'm gonna file a motion to dismiss.

09:06.520 --> 09:08.385
- You won't get it.
- I will get it.

09:08.456 --> 09:10.390
And if the M.T.D. is denied,
I'll file a motion...

09:10.458 --> 09:13.291
seeking to obtain
an evidentiary ruling in advance.

09:13.360 --> 09:15.726
And after that, I'm gonna file
against pretrial confinement.

09:15.796 --> 09:18.321
And you're gonna spend the next three
months going blind on paperwork...

09:18.399 --> 09:22.028
because a signalman second-class bought
and smoked a dime bag of oregano.

09:22.103 --> 09:24.628
Let's go! Let's get two!

09:25.706 --> 09:28.140
B misdemeanor,
20 days in the brig.

09:28.209 --> 09:30.473
C misdemeanor,
15 days restricted duty.

09:31.946 --> 09:33.971
I don't know why
I'm agreeing to this.

09:34.048 --> 09:36.312
'Cause you have wisdom
beyond your years.

09:40.221 --> 09:41.882
Morning.

09:41.956 --> 09:43.651
Morning, Captain.

09:43.724 --> 09:45.248
How's the baby, Sam?

09:45.326 --> 09:48.523
I think she's getting ready
to say her first word any day now.

09:48.596 --> 09:50.188
How can you tell?

09:50.264 --> 09:53.893
She just looks
like she has something to say.

09:53.968 --> 09:56.562
Excuse me.
I'm sorry I'm late.

09:56.637 --> 09:58.628
It's all right, Danny.
I know you don't have a good excuse...

09:58.706 --> 10:00.765
so I won't force you
to come up with a bad one.

10:00.841 --> 10:03.776
- Thank you, sir.
- This first one's for you.

10:04.845 --> 10:07.211
Seems you're moving up
in the world.

10:07.281 --> 10:09.215
Been requested by Division.

10:10.117 --> 10:12.051
Requested to do what?

10:12.119 --> 10:14.485
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

10:14.555 --> 10:18.616
A Marine corporal named Dawson illegally
fires a round from his weapon...

10:18.692 --> 10:21.559
over the fence line
and into Cuban territory.

10:21.629 --> 10:23.529
- What's a fence line?
- Sam.

10:23.597 --> 10:27.795
A big wall separating the good guys
from the bad guys.

10:27.868 --> 10:31.133
- Teacher's pet.
- P.F.C. William Santiago...

10:31.205 --> 10:34.538
threatens to rat on Dawson
to Naval Investigative Service.

10:34.608 --> 10:36.633
Dawson and another member
of his squad...

10:36.710 --> 10:40.669
P.F.C. Louden Downey,
go into Santiago's room...

10:40.748 --> 10:44.149
tie him up,
stuff a rag down his throat...

10:44.218 --> 10:46.311
and an hour later, Santiago's dead.

10:46.387 --> 10:50.084
Attending physician says the rag
was treated with some kind of toxin.

10:50.157 --> 10:51.385
They poisoned the rag?

10:51.458 --> 10:54.393
- Not according to them.
- What did they say?

10:54.461 --> 10:57.089
Not much.
They're being flown up here tomorrow...

10:57.164 --> 11:00.622
and on Wednesday at 0600, you'll catch
a transport down to Cuba for the day...

11:00.701 --> 11:02.635
to find out what you can.

11:02.703 --> 11:06.400
Meantime, go and see
Lieutenant Commander Joanne Galloway...

11:07.942 --> 11:09.603
with Internal Affairs.

11:09.677 --> 11:11.201
Any questions?

11:11.278 --> 11:15.305
Uh, the flight to Cuba-
Was that 0600 in the morning, sir?

11:16.450 --> 11:18.850
Seems important to Division
that this one be handled by the book.

11:18.919 --> 11:22.946
So I'm assigning co-counsel.
Any volunteers?

11:24.647 --> 11:25.447
No!

11:25.626 --> 11:27.617
I got a stack of papers on my desk
about a mile high.

11:27.695 --> 11:29.629
- Work with Kaffee on this.
- Doing what?

11:29.697 --> 11:31.927
Kaffee will have this done
in about four days.

11:31.999 --> 11:35.264
Doing various administrative things.

11:35.336 --> 11:37.270
Backup, whatever.

11:37.338 --> 11:39.898
In other words, I have
no responsibilities here whatsoever.

11:39.974 --> 11:41.464
Right.

11:41.542 --> 11:43.635
My kind of case.

11:44.712 --> 11:46.703
Right.

11:46.780 --> 11:49.271
Okay, but I've got to have
that report by Wednesday.

11:55.656 --> 11:58.386
- Hi.
- Hold on. Hi.

11:58.459 --> 12:00.791
Daniel Kaffee.
I was told to me with, uh-

12:08.702 --> 12:11.170
Lieutenant Commander Galloway.

12:13.407 --> 12:14.669
About a briefing?

12:14.742 --> 12:16.676
I'll call you back.

12:19.413 --> 12:21.347
You're the attorney Division assigned?

12:22.249 --> 12:24.183
I'm lead counsel.
This is Sam Weinberg.

12:24.251 --> 12:26.412
I have no responsibilities here
whatsoever.

12:26.487 --> 12:28.648
Come in, please. Have a seat.

12:39.099 --> 12:41.260
Lieutenant, how long
have you been in the Navy?

12:42.936 --> 12:44.870
Going on nine months now.

12:44.938 --> 12:47.532
And how long have you been
out of law school?

12:48.742 --> 12:50.209
A little over a year.

12:50.277 --> 12:52.370
I see.

12:53.113 --> 12:54.705
Have I done something wrong?

12:54.782 --> 12:57.444
No. It’s just that when I petition
Division to have counsel assigned...

12:57.518 --> 12:59.509
I was hoping I'd be taken seriously.

12:59.586 --> 13:02.282
No offense taken,
in case you were wondering.

13:02.356 --> 13:04.221
Commander,
Lieutenant Kaffee is generally...

13:04.291 --> 13:06.657
considered the best litigator
in our office.

13:06.727 --> 13:09.958
He's successfully plea-bargained
44 cases in nine months.

13:10.030 --> 13:12.021
One more,
I get a set of steak knives.

13:12.099 --> 13:13.896
Have you ever been in a courtroom?

13:13.967 --> 13:16.492
I once had
my driver's license suspended.

13:16.570 --> 13:18.538
Commander, from what I understand,
if this thing goes to court...

13:18.605 --> 13:20.766
they won’t need a lawyer,
they'll need a priest.

13:21.408 --> 13:23.342
No, they'll need a lawyer.

13:24.411 --> 13:26.470
Dawson's family's been contacted.

13:26.547 --> 13:30.074
Downey's closest living relative
is Ginny Miller, his aunt.

13:30.150 --> 13:33.051
She hasn't been contacted yet.
Would you like me to take care of that?

13:33.120 --> 13:34.610
Sure. If you feel like it.

13:36.390 --> 13:38.324
One of the people
you'll be seeing down there...

13:38.392 --> 13:40.451
is the barracks C.O.,
Colonel Nathan Jessup.

13:40.527 --> 13:42.654
I assume you’ve heard of him.

13:42.730 --> 13:44.163
Who hasn't?

13:45.232 --> 13:47.826
He's been in the papers lately.
He's expected to be appointed...

13:47.901 --> 13:50.734
director of operations
of National Security Council.

13:50.804 --> 13:52.101
- Really?
- These are the letters...

13:52.172 --> 13:54.470
that Santiago wrote
in his eight months at Gitmo.

13:54.541 --> 13:57.009
- That's Guantanamo Bay.
- I knew that one.

13:57.077 --> 14:00.604
He wrote to the fleet commander
to the commandant of the Marine Corps.

14:00.681 --> 14:03.616
Even his senator. He wanted
to be transferred off the base.

14:03.684 --> 14:05.618
No one was listening.
Are you with me?

14:05.686 --> 14:07.586
Yeah.

14:08.822 --> 14:10.813
Finally, he wrote
to the Naval Investigative Service...

14:10.891 --> 14:13.917
where he offered information about
Corporal Dawson's fence line shooting...

14:13.994 --> 14:16.622
in exchange for a transfer.

14:16.697 --> 14:19.325
Right. Is that all?

14:19.400 --> 14:21.334
Lieutenant,
this letter makes it look like...

14:21.402 --> 14:23.836
your client had a motive
to kill Santiago.

14:23.904 --> 14:27.169
Got you.
And Santiago is who?

14:27.241 --> 14:28.833
The victim.

14:28.909 --> 14:31.537
Write that down.
Am I correct to assume these letters...

14:31.612 --> 14:34.513
don't paint a flattering picture
of Marine Corps life at Guantanamo Bay?

14:34.581 --> 14:36.048
- Yes, among-
- Am I further right in assuming...

14:36.116 --> 14:39.950
investigation of this incident might
embarrass the Security Council guy?

14:40.020 --> 14:42.011
- Colonel Jessup.
- Twelve years.

14:43.090 --> 14:44.022
Sorry?

14:44.091 --> 14:46.286
I'll get them to drop the conspiracy
and conduct unbecoming.

14:46.360 --> 14:48.123
Twelve years.

14:48.195 --> 14:51.824
You haven't talked to a witness
or looked at a piece of paper.

14:51.899 --> 14:53.958
Pretty impressive, huh?

14:54.034 --> 14:55.729
You're gonna have
to go deeper than that.

14:55.803 --> 14:58.567
Do you have some sort of jurisdiction
here that I should know about?

14:58.639 --> 15:01.437
My job is to make sure
that you do your job.

15:01.508 --> 15:03.476
I'm special counsel
for Internal Affairs...

15:03.544 --> 15:06.911
so my jurisdiction’s pretty much
in your face.

15:09.082 --> 15:12.142
Read the letters. I'll expect
your report when you return from Cuba.

15:12.219 --> 15:14.881
- Sure.
- You're dismissed.

15:17.157 --> 15:19.489
I always forget that part.

15:21.261 --> 15:24.025
He's a little preoccupied.

15:24.097 --> 15:27.260
Team's playing Bethesda Medical
next week.

15:27.334 --> 15:29.268
Tell your friend
not to get cute down there.

15:29.336 --> 15:31.668
The Marines in Guantanamo
are fanatical.

15:31.738 --> 15:33.035
About what?

15:33.774 --> 15:35.435
About being Marines.

15:35.509 --> 15:36.533
Dear sir...

15:36.610 --> 15:39.374
my name is P.F.C. William T. Santiago.

15:39.446 --> 15:41.778
I'm a Marine stationed
at Marine barracks...

15:41.849 --> 15:45.046
Rifle Security Company Windward,
Second Platoon Bravo.

15:45.118 --> 15:48.918
I'm writing to inform you of my problems
with my unit here in Cuba...

15:48.989 --> 15:50.616
and to ask for your help.

15:50.691 --> 15:54.024
I've fallen out on runs before
for several reasons...

15:54.094 --> 15:56.062
such as feeling dizzy or nauseated.

15:56.129 --> 15:59.860
But on May 18, I'd fallen back
about 20 or 30 yards...

15:59.933 --> 16:02.458
going down rocky unstable hill.

16:02.536 --> 16:05.505
My sergeant grabbed me
and pushed me down the hill.

16:05.572 --> 16:09.474
Then I saw all black, and the last thing
I remembered was hitting the deck.

16:09.543 --> 16:12.910
I was brought to the hospital where
I was told I just had heat exhaustion.

16:12.980 --> 16:14.607
I ask you to help me.

16:14.681 --> 16:18.139
Please, sir. I just need
to be transferred out of R.S.C.

16:18.218 --> 16:21.051
Sincerely,
P.F.C. William T. Santiago...

16:21.121 --> 16:22.713
U.S. Marine Corps.

16:22.789 --> 16:25.724
P.S. In exchange for my transfer
off the base...

16:25.792 --> 16:27.783
I'm willing to provide you
with information about-

16:27.861 --> 16:32.127
"The illegal fence line shooting
that occurred the night of August 2."

16:33.066 --> 16:37.435
Who the fuck
is P.F.C. William T. Santiago?

16:37.504 --> 16:40.598
Private Santiago is a member
of Second Platoon Bravo, sir.

16:40.674 --> 16:44.872
Yeah. Well, apparently he's not
very happy down here in Shangri-la...

16:44.945 --> 16:47.812
because he's written letters
to everybody but Santa Claus...

16:47.881 --> 16:50.008
asking for a transfer.

16:50.083 --> 16:53.018
And now he's telling tales
about a fence line shooting.

16:54.087 --> 16:55.679
Matthew?

16:55.756 --> 16:58.316
I'm appalled, sir.

16:59.126 --> 17:01.560
You're appalled.

17:02.629 --> 17:06.156
This kid broke the chain of command
and ratted on a member of his unit...

17:06.233 --> 17:09.031
to say nothing of the fact
that he is a U.S. Marine...

17:09.102 --> 17:11.832
and it would appear he can't run
from here to there...

17:11.905 --> 17:14.669
without collapsing
from heat exhaustion.

17:14.741 --> 17:18.006
What the fuck is going on
in Bravo Company, Matthew?

17:18.078 --> 17:21.104
Colonel, I think it would be better
to hold this discussion in private.

17:21.181 --> 17:25.311
That won't be necessary, Colonel.
I can handle the situation, sir.

17:25.385 --> 17:29.116
The same way you handled Curtis Bell?
Don't interrupt me, Lieutenant!

17:29.189 --> 17:32.716
- I'm still your superior officer.
- And I'm yours, Matthew.

17:34.895 --> 17:37.955
I wanna know
what we're going to do about this.

17:38.031 --> 17:40.966
I think Santiago should be transferred
off the base immediately.

17:41.034 --> 17:42.661
He's that bad, huh?

17:42.736 --> 17:44.863
Not only that. But word
of this letter is bound to get out.

17:44.938 --> 17:46.872
He's gonna get his ass whipped.

17:46.940 --> 17:50.967
Hmm. Transfer Santiago.

17:51.044 --> 17:54.571
Yes. I'm sure you’re right.

17:54.648 --> 17:57.139
I'm sure that's the thing to do.

17:58.852 --> 18:02.754
Wait. I've got a better idea.

18:02.823 --> 18:05.758
Let's transfer the whole squad
off the base.

18:05.826 --> 18:08.920
Let's- On second thought, Windward-

18:08.996 --> 18:13.228
Let's transfer the whole
Windward Division off the base.

18:13.300 --> 18:16.929
John, go on out there
and get those boys down off the fence.

18:17.004 --> 18:19.495
They're packing their bags. Tom.

18:20.774 --> 18:23.174
- Sir.
- Get me the president on the phone.

18:23.243 --> 18:26.337
We're surrendering
our position in Cuba.

18:26.413 --> 18:28.847
- Yes, sir.
- Wait a minute, Tom.

18:28.915 --> 18:30.849
Don't get the president just yet.

18:30.917 --> 18:34.546
Maybe we should
consider this for a second.

18:34.621 --> 18:36.885
- Dismissed, Tom.
- Yes, sir.

18:37.991 --> 18:41.859
Maybe- and I'm just
spit-balling here-

18:41.928 --> 18:46.956
Maybe we have a responsibility
as officers to train Santiago.

18:47.034 --> 18:51.198
Maybe we as officers
have a responsibility to this country...

18:51.271 --> 18:54.570
to see that the men and women
charged with its security...

18:54.641 --> 18:56.700
are trained professionals.

18:56.777 --> 19:00.713
Yes, I'm certain
that I read that somewhere once.

19:00.781 --> 19:03.375
And now I'm thinking,
Colonel Markinson...

19:03.450 --> 19:07.784
that your suggestion
of transferring Santiago...

19:07.854 --> 19:11.085
while expeditious
and certainly painless...

19:11.158 --> 19:13.649
might not be,
in a manner of speaking...

19:13.727 --> 19:16.628
the American way.

19:16.697 --> 19:19.495
Santiago stays where he is.

19:21.201 --> 19:23.533
We're gonna train the lad.

19:23.603 --> 19:26.538
John, you're in charge.

19:26.606 --> 19:29.769
Santiago doesn't make 4-6-4-6...

19:29.843 --> 19:33.506
on his next proficiency
and conduct report...

19:33.580 --> 19:35.912
I'm going to blame you.

19:35.982 --> 19:38.610
- Then I'm going to kill you.
- Yes, sir.

19:38.685 --> 19:41.279
I think that's a mistake, Colonel.

19:42.689 --> 19:46.819
Matthew, I think I will
have that word in private with you now.

19:46.893 --> 19:50.852
John, that's all. Why don't we meet
at the "O" club and have lunch...

19:50.931 --> 19:53.525
and we'll talk about the training
of young William?

19:53.600 --> 19:56.330
I'd be delighted to hear any
suggestions that you might have, sir.

19:56.403 --> 19:58.371
- Dismissed.
- Yes, sir.

20:02.142 --> 20:05.339
Matthew, sit down. Please.

20:10.517 --> 20:13.111
What do you think of Kendrick?

20:13.186 --> 20:15.017
My opinion of him has nothing to do-

20:15.088 --> 20:18.251
I think he's pretty much
of a weasel myself...

20:18.325 --> 20:20.316
but he's an awfully good officer.

20:20.393 --> 20:24.830
And in the end, we see eye-to-eye on
the best way to run a Marine Corps unit.

20:24.898 --> 20:28.425
We're in the business
of saving lives, Matthew.

20:28.502 --> 20:32.199
That is a responsibility
that we have to take pretty seriously.

20:32.272 --> 20:36.606
And I believe that taking a Marine
who is not quite up to the job...

20:36.676 --> 20:39.144
and shipping him off
to another assignment...

20:39.212 --> 20:41.203
puts lives in danger.

20:41.982 --> 20:44.246
Sit down, Matthew.

20:53.760 --> 20:55.819
We go back a while.

20:55.896 --> 20:59.388
We went to the Academy together.
We were commissioned together.

20:59.466 --> 21:01.934
We did our tours in Vietnam together.

21:02.002 --> 21:04.368
But I've been promoted
up through the chain...

21:04.437 --> 21:07.338
with greater speed and success
than you have.

21:07.407 --> 21:10.376
Now, if that’s a source of tension...

21:10.443 --> 21:12.411
or embarrassment for you...

21:12.479 --> 21:14.242
I don't give a shit.

21:14.314 --> 21:19.513
We're in the business of saving lives,
Lieutenant Colonel Markinson.

21:19.586 --> 21:23.682
Don't ever question my orders
in front of another officer.

21:43.677 --> 21:45.144
All the paperwork's in order.

21:46.213 --> 21:48.147
- Step over there.
- Yes, sir.

21:52.819 --> 21:55.583
Hal, is this Washington, D.C.?

21:55.655 --> 21:57.282
All right. Let's move.

21:57.357 --> 21:58.790
Yes, sir.

22:05.665 --> 22:08.600
- Got all of that one.
- Excuse me.

22:08.668 --> 22:12.263
I wanted to talk to you about
Corporal Dawson and Private Downey.

22:12.339 --> 22:14.933
- Say again?
- Dawson and Downey.

22:16.209 --> 22:18.234
Those names sound like
they should mean something to me-

22:18.311 --> 22:21.109
Dawson, Downey - your clients.

22:21.181 --> 22:24.480
The Cuba thing. Yes!
Dawson and Downey. Right.

22:27.687 --> 22:29.746
I've done something wrong again,
haven't I?

22:29.823 --> 22:31.814
I was just wondering
why two guys have been locked up...

22:31.892 --> 22:34.656
since this morning while their lawyer's
outside hitting a ball.

22:36.663 --> 22:38.358
We need the practice.

22:38.431 --> 22:40.023
That wasn't funny.

22:40.767 --> 22:42.132
It was a little funny.

22:42.202 --> 22:45.501
Would you be very insulted
if I recommended to your supervisor...

22:45.572 --> 22:47.506
that he assign different counsel?

22:47.574 --> 22:51.010
- Why?
- I don't think you’re fit to handle it.

22:51.077 --> 22:54.843
You don't even know me.
Ordinarily, it takes someone hours...

22:54.915 --> 22:57.543
to discover I'm not fit
to handle a defense.

22:59.286 --> 23:02.653
Oh, come on.
That was damn funny.

23:05.659 --> 23:06.819
You're wrong.

23:07.894 --> 23:09.885
I do know you.

23:09.963 --> 23:13.797
Daniel Alistair Kaffee,
born June 8, 1964...

23:13.867 --> 23:15.801
at Boston Mercy Hospital.

23:15.869 --> 23:17.200
Your father's Lionel Kaffee...

23:17.270 --> 23:20.762
former Navy judge advocate and
attorney general of the United States.

23:20.840 --> 23:22.398
Died 1985.

23:22.475 --> 23:25.205
You went to Harvard law.
Then you joined the Navy...

23:25.278 --> 23:28.042
probably because that's
what your father wanted you to do.

23:28.114 --> 23:31.447
And now you're just treading water
for three years in the JAG Corps.

23:31.518 --> 23:35.010
Just laying low till
you can get out and get a real job.

23:35.088 --> 23:38.649
If that’s the situation, that's fine.
I won't tell anyone.

23:38.725 --> 23:41.023
But it's my feeling that
if this case is handled in the same...

23:41.094 --> 23:43.961
fast-food, slick-ass,
Persian bazaar manner...

23:44.030 --> 23:45.964
with which you seem
to handle everything else...

23:46.032 --> 23:47.693
then something's gonna get missed.

23:47.767 --> 23:50.429
And I wouldn't be doing my job
if I allowed Dawson and Downey...

23:50.503 --> 23:53.063
to spend any more time in prison
than absolutely necessary...

23:53.139 --> 23:56.233
because their attorney had predetermined
the path of least resistance.

23:59.012 --> 24:00.445
Wow.

24:01.581 --> 24:04.049
I'm sexually aroused, Commander.

24:04.751 --> 24:07.015
I don't think
your clients murdered anyone.

24:07.087 --> 24:08.452
What are you basing this on?

24:08.521 --> 24:10.318
There was no intent.

24:10.390 --> 24:13.223
The doctor's report says
Santiago died of asphyxiation...

24:13.293 --> 24:15.227
brought on by acute lactic acidosis...

24:15.295 --> 24:19.129
and that the nature of the acidosis
strongly suggests poison.

24:19.199 --> 24:21.963
I don't know what any of that means,
but it sounds pretty bad.

24:22.035 --> 24:23.969
Santiago died at 1:00 a. m.

24:24.037 --> 24:26.835
At 3:00, the doctor wasn’t able
to determine the cause of death.

24:26.906 --> 24:29.136
Two hours later,
he said it was poison.

24:29.209 --> 24:31.734
Oh, now I see what you’re saying.

24:31.811 --> 24:35.110
It had to be Professor Plum
in the library with a candlestick.

24:35.181 --> 24:37.649
- I'm gonna talk to your supervisor.
- Okay.

24:37.717 --> 24:39.878
Go straight up Pennsylvania Avenue.

24:39.953 --> 24:42.444
It's the big white house
with the pillars in front.

24:42.522 --> 24:45.719
- Thank you.
- I don't think you’ll have much luck.

24:45.792 --> 24:47.225
I was assigned by Division.

24:47.293 --> 24:50.353
Somebody over there thinks
I'm a pretty good lawyer.

24:50.430 --> 24:53.922
So while I appreciate your interest
and admire your enthusiasm...

24:54.000 --> 24:56.468
I think I can handle things myself.

24:56.536 --> 24:58.629
You know what a Code Red is?

25:02.509 --> 25:04.636
What a pity.

25:14.854 --> 25:17.322
- Morning, sir.
- Morning.

25:18.258 --> 25:19.919
Officer on deck!

25:19.993 --> 25:22.154
Sir, Lance Corporal
Harold W. Dawson, sir!

25:22.228 --> 25:24.423
Rifle Security Company Windward,
Second Platoon Bravo.

25:24.497 --> 25:27.762
Someone hasn't been working
and playing well with others, Harold.

25:27.834 --> 25:29.768
Sir, yes, sir!

25:31.538 --> 25:33.870
Sir, P.F.C. Louden Downey, sir!

25:35.375 --> 25:37.969
I'm Daniel Kaffee.
This is Sam Weinberg.

25:38.044 --> 25:39.204
Sit down.

25:46.519 --> 25:49.317
- This your signature?
- Yes, sir.

25:49.389 --> 25:51.186
You don't have to call me "sir. "
Is this your signature?

25:51.257 --> 25:52.451
Sir, yes, sir.

25:52.525 --> 25:55.392
You certainly don't need
to do it twice in one sentence.

25:55.462 --> 25:59.057
- What's a Code Red?
- It is a disciplinary engagement.

25:59.132 --> 26:00.565
What's that mean?

26:00.633 --> 26:04.501
A Marine falls out of line, it's up to
the men in his unit to get him on track.

26:04.571 --> 26:08.063
- What's a garden variety Code Red?
- Sir?

26:08.141 --> 26:12.077
Harold, you say, "sir," and
I turn around and look for my father.

26:12.145 --> 26:14.705
Danny, Daniel, Kaffee.

26:14.781 --> 26:17.841
Garden variety. Typical.
What's basic Code Red?

26:17.917 --> 26:20.545
Sir, a Marine refuses to bathe
on a regular basis...

26:20.620 --> 26:23.214
the men in his squad
will give him a G.I. shower.

26:23.289 --> 26:24.551
What's that?

26:24.624 --> 26:27.149
Scrub brushes,
Brillo pads, steel wool.

26:27.227 --> 26:28.558
Beautiful.

26:28.628 --> 26:31.153
Was the attack on Santiago
a Code Red?

26:31.231 --> 26:32.926
Yes, sir.

26:38.171 --> 26:41.334
Does he ever talk?

26:41.407 --> 26:44.706
Sir, P.F.C. Downey will answer
any direct questions you ask him.

26:44.777 --> 26:46.335
Swell.

26:47.947 --> 26:50.711
Private Downey, the rag
you stuffed in Santiago's mouth-

26:50.783 --> 26:52.717
- Was there poison on it?
- No, sir.

26:52.785 --> 26:55.276
Silver polish,
turpentine, antifreeze?

26:55.355 --> 26:57.721
No, sir. We were just
gonna shave his head, sir.

26:57.790 --> 27:00.588
When all of the sudden-

27:00.660 --> 27:03.094
We saw blood dripping
down his mouth...

27:03.163 --> 27:07.361
and we pulled the tape off and
there was blood all down his face, sir.

27:07.433 --> 27:10.698
That's when Lance Corporal Dawson
called the ambulance.

27:10.770 --> 27:12.465
Did anyone see you call
the ambulance?

27:14.474 --> 27:15.634
No, sir.

27:18.144 --> 27:19.873
Were you there
when the ambulance got there?

27:19.946 --> 27:22.312
Yes, sir. That's when
we were taken under arrest.

27:22.382 --> 27:27.183
The night of August 2, did you fire
a shot across the fence line into Cuba?

27:29.122 --> 27:30.555
- Yes, sir.
- Why?

27:30.623 --> 27:33.421
- My mirror engaged, sir.
- His mirror?

27:33.493 --> 27:37.361
Every American sentry post has
a Cuban counterpart, called "mirrors. "

27:37.430 --> 27:40.888
Lance Corporal's claiming that
his mirror was about to fire at him.

27:40.967 --> 27:43.435
Santiago's letter to the N.I.S...

27:43.503 --> 27:45.971
said you fired illegally.

27:46.039 --> 27:49.975
He's saying that the guy, the mirror-

27:50.043 --> 27:51.635
He never made a move.

27:58.084 --> 28:00.018
You see what I'm getting at?

28:01.087 --> 28:04.318
If Santiago didn't have anything on you,
then why did you give him a Code Red?

28:04.390 --> 28:06.585
'Cause he broke
the chain of command, sir.

28:06.659 --> 28:09.628
- He what?
- He went outside of his unit, sir.

28:09.696 --> 28:12.096
If he had a problem,
he should have spoken to me, sir.

28:12.165 --> 28:15.191
- Then his sergeant, then commander-
- Yeah. All right.

28:15.268 --> 28:17.930
Did you assault Santiago
with the intent of killing him?

28:18.004 --> 28:19.665
- No, sir.
- What was your intent?

28:19.739 --> 28:22.503
- To train him, sir.
- Train him to do what?

28:22.575 --> 28:27.103
Train him to think of his unit
before himself- to respect the code.

28:27.180 --> 28:28.977
What's the code?

28:29.048 --> 28:31.016
Unit, Corps, God, Country.

28:31.084 --> 28:32.346
I beg your pardon?

28:32.418 --> 28:37.788
Unit, Corps, God, Country, sir.

28:53.673 --> 28:56.574
The government
of the United States...

28:56.643 --> 28:59.441
wants to charge you two
with murder...

28:59.512 --> 29:01.503
and you want me
to go to the prosecutor...

29:01.581 --> 29:05.142
with "Unit, Corps, God, Country"?

29:05.218 --> 29:07.209
That's our code, sir.

29:11.224 --> 29:13.055
It's your code.

29:13.126 --> 29:15.686
We'll be back.

29:15.762 --> 29:19.630
You guys need anything- books,
papers, cigarettes, ham sandwich?

29:19.699 --> 29:21.997
Sir, no, thank you, sir.

29:22.068 --> 29:25.868
Harold, I think there's a concept
you better start warming up to.

29:25.938 --> 29:27.200
Sir?

29:27.273 --> 29:29.867
I'm the only friend you've got.

29:45.024 --> 29:46.286
Smiling Jack Ross.

29:46.359 --> 29:48.589
- Welcome to the big time.
- You think so?

29:48.661 --> 29:52.529
Let's hope, for Dawson and Downey, you
practice law better than play softball.

29:52.598 --> 29:56.125
Unfortunately for those two, I don't
do anything better than play softball.

29:56.202 --> 29:57.726
- I'm out of here, Janelle.
- Bye.

29:57.804 --> 30:00.102
- See you when I get back from Cuba.
- Say hi to Castro for me.

30:00.173 --> 30:02.471
Will do.
What are we looking at?

30:02.542 --> 30:05.705
They plead guilty, we drop
the conspiracy and conduct unbecoming.

30:05.778 --> 30:08.042
- Twenty years. They're home in half.
- I want 12.

30:08.114 --> 30:10.082
- Can't do it.
- They called the ambulance.

30:10.149 --> 30:13.482
I don't care if they called
the Avon lady. They killed a Marine.

30:13.553 --> 30:15.953
The rag was tested for poison.
The autopsy, lab reports.

30:16.022 --> 30:17.683
They say the same thing:
maybe, maybe not.

30:17.757 --> 30:20.817
Chief of Internal Medicine
at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Hospital...

30:20.893 --> 30:22.417
says he's sure.

30:22.495 --> 30:24.554
What do you know about Code Reds?

30:24.630 --> 30:26.063
Oh, man.

30:28.568 --> 30:31.059
- We off the record?
- Tell me.

30:32.338 --> 30:34.272
I'm gonna give you the 12 years.

30:34.340 --> 30:37.503
Before you go getting yourself into
trouble tomorrow, you should know...

30:37.577 --> 30:39.704
the platoon commander,
Lieutenant Jonathan Kendrick...

30:39.779 --> 30:42.714
held a meeting with the men
and specifically...

30:42.782 --> 30:45.216
told them not to touch Santiago.

30:47.820 --> 30:50.653
- We still playing hoops tomorrow night?
- Do we have a deal?

30:50.723 --> 30:53.419
I'll talk to you when I get back.

30:56.896 --> 30:59.660
- Hi there.
- Any luck getting me replaced?

30:59.732 --> 31:02.963
Is there anyone in this command you
don't either drink or play ball with?

31:03.035 --> 31:04.969
- Commander-
- Listen. I came to make peace.

31:05.037 --> 31:09.064
Got off on the wrong foot.
What do you say? Friends?

31:09.142 --> 31:12.202
I brought Downey some comic books
he was asking for.

31:12.278 --> 31:14.712
The kid, Kaffee,
I swear he doesn't know where he is.

31:14.781 --> 31:17.113
- Doesn't even know why he's arrested.
- Commander.

31:17.183 --> 31:18.946
- You can call me Joanne.
-Joanne.

31:19.018 --> 31:21.248
- Or Jo.
- Yes.

31:21.320 --> 31:24.312
Jo, if you ever speak to a client
of mine again without my permission...

31:24.390 --> 31:25.948
I'll have you disbarred.

31:26.025 --> 31:29.256
- Friends?
- I had authorization.

31:29.328 --> 31:32.092
- From where?
- Downey's closest living relative.

31:32.165 --> 31:35.726
Ginny Miller.
His aunt on his mother's side.

31:35.802 --> 31:38.134
You got authorization
from Aunt Ginny?

31:38.204 --> 31:40.195
I gave her a call
like you asked.

31:40.273 --> 31:42.673
Very nice woman.
We spoke for about an hour.

31:42.742 --> 31:45.267
You got authorization
from Aunt Ginny.

31:45.344 --> 31:48.006
Perfectly within my province.

31:48.080 --> 31:50.514
Does Aunt Ginny have a barn?
We could hold the trial there.

31:50.583 --> 31:53.711
I can sew the costumes.
Maybe his Uncle Goober can be the judge.

31:57.156 --> 31:59.681
I'm going to Cuba with you tomorrow.

32:01.694 --> 32:04.492
And the hits just keep on coming.

32:27.520 --> 32:31.081
- How's it going, Luther?
- Another day, another dollar, captain.

32:31.157 --> 32:34.354
- You gotta play them as they lay.
- What goes around comes around.

32:34.427 --> 32:37.863
- Can't beat 'em, join 'em.
- At least I got my health.

32:37.930 --> 32:41.696
Well, then you got everything.
See you tomorrow, Luther.

32:41.767 --> 32:43.701
Not if I see you first.

32:46.038 --> 32:48.029
Now don't forget.
When Sally gets back, you're my witness.

32:48.107 --> 32:50.405
The baby spoke.
My daughter said a word.

32:50.476 --> 32:52.774
Your daughter made a sound, Sam.
I'm not sure it was a word.

32:52.845 --> 32:54.779
Come on, now.
It was definitely a word.

32:57.683 --> 33:00.345
You heard her. The girl sat here,
pointed and said, " Pa. "

33:00.419 --> 33:02.512
She did. She said, " Pa. "

33:02.588 --> 33:04.818
She was pointing at a mailbox, Sam.

33:04.891 --> 33:08.850
That's right, pointing as if to say,
" Pa, look. A mailbox. "

33:16.402 --> 33:19.530
Jack Ross came to see me today.
He offered me the 12 years.

33:19.605 --> 33:22.301
- Oh, that's what you wanted, right?
- I know, I know.

33:23.376 --> 33:27.938
I mean, I guess I'll take it.
I'll take it.

33:29.015 --> 33:32.143
- So-
- It took about 45 seconds.

33:32.218 --> 33:33.913
He barely put up a fight.

33:33.986 --> 33:36.546
Danny, take the 12 years.
It's a gift.

33:37.623 --> 33:39.557
You don't believe their story,
do you?

33:39.625 --> 33:41.786
You think they ought to go to jail
for the rest of their lives.

33:41.861 --> 33:44.056
I believe every word of their story...

33:44.130 --> 33:47.156
and I think they ought to go to jail
for the rest of their lives.

33:52.605 --> 33:54.539
- See you tomorrow.
- Okay.

33:54.607 --> 33:57.235
Don't forget to wear the whites.
Very hot down there.

33:57.310 --> 33:59.175
I don't like the whites.

33:59.245 --> 34:01.611
Nobody likes the whites,
but we're going to Cuba.

34:01.681 --> 34:04.377
- You got Dramamine?
- Dramamine keeps you cool?

34:04.450 --> 34:08.011
No, Dramamine keeps you from
throwing up. You get sick when you fly.

34:08.087 --> 34:11.454
I get sick when I fly because I'm afraid
of crashing into a large mountain.

34:11.524 --> 34:13.082
I don't think Dramamine will help.

34:14.093 --> 34:16.527
I got some oregano.
I hear that works pretty good.

34:19.966 --> 34:23.197
You know, Ross said the strangest thing
to me right before I left.

34:23.269 --> 34:26.670
He said the platoon commander
Lieutenant Jonathan Kendrick...

34:26.739 --> 34:30.368
had a meeting with the men
and told them not to touch Santiago.

34:30.443 --> 34:31.842
So?

34:33.212 --> 34:35.578
I never mentioned Kendrick.
I don't even know who he is.

34:39.218 --> 34:43.211
Ah, what the hell.
I'll see you tomorrow.

35:19.125 --> 35:21.821
Lieutenants Kaffee and Weinberg,
Commander Galloway.

35:21.894 --> 35:24.590
I'm Corporal Barnes. I'm to escort you
to the windward side of the base.

35:24.664 --> 35:27.827
- Thank you.
- I got some camouflage jackets here.

35:27.900 --> 35:31.028
- I suggest you both put them on.
- Camouflage jackets?

35:31.103 --> 35:34.231
Yes, sir. We'll be riding
pretty close to the fence line.

35:34.306 --> 35:36.467
The Cubans see
an officer wearing white...

35:36.542 --> 35:39.102
they think it might be someone
they want to take a shot at.

35:40.913 --> 35:43.381
Good call, Sam.

35:47.953 --> 35:50.581
We'll just hop on the ferry.
We'll be there in no time.

35:50.656 --> 35:53.250
- Wait. We gotta take a boat?
- Yes, sir.

35:53.325 --> 35:56.954
- To get to the other side of the bay.
- Nobody said anything about a boat.

35:57.029 --> 35:59.827
- Is there a problem, sir?
- No, no problem.

35:59.899 --> 36:01.662
Just not crazy about boats.

36:01.734 --> 36:06.000
Jesus Christ, Kaffee,
you're in the Navy, for crying out loud.

36:06.072 --> 36:09.633
- Nobody likes her very much.
- Yes, sir!

36:22.822 --> 36:25.416
Nathan Jessup. Come on in.

36:25.491 --> 36:29.518
Thank you, sir. Daniel Kaffee.
I'm the attorney for Dawson and Downey.

36:29.595 --> 36:31.961
This is
Lieutenant Commander Joanne Galloway.

36:32.031 --> 36:35.228
- Pleasure meeting you, Commander.
- Observing and evaluating, sir.

36:35.301 --> 36:37.235
Lieutenant Sam Weinberg.
He'll be assisting.

36:37.303 --> 36:40.033
- Sir.
- This is my X.O., Colonel Markinson...

36:40.106 --> 36:42.131
and platoon leader Lieutenant Kendrick.

36:42.208 --> 36:44.699
I've asked them to join us.
Sit down, please.

36:44.777 --> 36:47.245
- Lieutenant Kaffee.
- Colonel Markinson.

36:47.313 --> 36:49.804
I had the pleasure
of meeting your father once.

36:49.882 --> 36:51.941
I was a teenager.
He spoke at my high school.

36:52.952 --> 36:54.146
Lionel Kaffee?

36:54.987 --> 36:56.955
- Yes, sir.
- Well, what do you know?

36:57.022 --> 37:01.618
John, this man's dad once made a lot of
enemies down in your neck of the woods.

37:01.694 --> 37:05.460
Jefferson v. Madison County
School District.

37:05.531 --> 37:09.865
Folks down there said a black girl
couldn't go to an all-white school.

37:09.935 --> 37:13.871
Lionel Kaffee said,
"Well, we'll just see about that. "

37:13.939 --> 37:16.499
How the hell is your dad, Danny?

37:16.575 --> 37:18.975
He passed away seven years ago, sir.

37:20.713 --> 37:23.580
Don't I feel like the fuckin' asshole.

37:23.649 --> 37:24.980
Not at all.

37:26.218 --> 37:28.311
Well, what can we do for you, Danny?

37:28.387 --> 37:30.321
Uh, not much, sir.

37:31.824 --> 37:35.726
This is really a formality
more than anything else.

37:36.796 --> 37:39.697
JAG Corps insists that we interview
all the relevant witnesses.

37:39.765 --> 37:41.733
The JAG Corps can be demanding
that way.

37:43.469 --> 37:46.267
John will take you out
and show you what you want to see.

37:46.338 --> 37:48.397
After that we can all
hook up for lunch.

37:48.474 --> 37:51.705
- How does that sound? Good.
- Fine, sir.

37:59.819 --> 38:02.253
I understand you had a meeting
with your men that afternoon.

38:02.321 --> 38:04.653
- Yes, I did.
- What did you guys talk about?

38:04.723 --> 38:07.089
I told the men
that we had an informer among us...

38:07.159 --> 38:10.151
and that despite any desire
they might have to seek retribution...

38:10.229 --> 38:13.721
Private Santiago
was not to be harmed in anyway.

38:13.799 --> 38:17.098
- What time was that meeting?
- 1600.

38:17.169 --> 38:20.036
That's 4:00.

39:11.390 --> 39:13.915
Sam, we should make sure
somebody gets this to his parents.

39:13.993 --> 39:17.156
- We don't need it anymore.
- Right.

39:18.430 --> 39:20.694
Lieutenant Kendrick,
may I call you John?

39:20.766 --> 39:22.825
No, you may not.

39:22.902 --> 39:25.029
Have I done something to offend you?

39:25.104 --> 39:27.197
No, I like all you Navy boys.

39:27.273 --> 39:31.334
Every time we gotta go someplace to
fight, you fellas always give us a ride.

39:32.711 --> 39:36.147
Lieutenant Kendrick,
do you think Santiago was murdered?

39:36.215 --> 39:39.082
Commander, I believe in God
and His Son Jesus Christ.

39:39.151 --> 39:41.142
And because I do, I can say this:

39:41.220 --> 39:44.951
Private Santiago is dead,
and that is a tragedy.

39:45.024 --> 39:47.288
But he is dead
because he had no code.

39:47.359 --> 39:51.659
He is dead because he had no honor,
and God was watching.

39:54.133 --> 39:55.896
How do you feel about that theory?

39:55.968 --> 39:58.198
Sounds good. Let's move on.

39:58.270 --> 40:00.261
Are you planning
on doing any investigating...

40:00.339 --> 40:02.273
or are you just gonna take
the guided tour?

40:03.909 --> 40:06.707
I'm pacing myself.

40:07.546 --> 40:09.275
They were running around
for three hours...

40:09.348 --> 40:12.283
looking for anything white
they could wave in the air.

40:12.351 --> 40:15.650
Some of these people surrendered
to a crew from CNN.

40:16.722 --> 40:21.989
Well, walk softly and carry
an armored tank division, I always say.

40:23.462 --> 40:26.693
- That was delicious. Thank you.
- My pleasure, sir.

40:26.765 --> 40:31.600
Colonel, I do have to ask you a couple
of questions about September 6.

40:31.670 --> 40:33.262
Shoot.

40:33.339 --> 40:35.933
On the morning of the sixth,
you were contacted by an N.I.S. agent...

40:36.008 --> 40:39.444
who said that Santiago tipped him off
to an illegal fence line shooting.

40:39.511 --> 40:41.706
- Yes.
- Santiago would reveal the person...

40:41.780 --> 40:44.578
- in exchange for a transfer.
- Yes.

40:47.686 --> 40:50.484
If you feel there are any details
that I'm missing...

40:50.556 --> 40:53.787
you should feel free to speak up.

40:56.362 --> 40:57.795
Thank you.

41:01.367 --> 41:04.165
Now, at this point you called
Lieutenant Colonel Markinson...

41:04.236 --> 41:06.568
and Lieutenant Kendrick
into your office.

41:06.638 --> 41:08.333
- Is that right?
- Yes.

41:08.407 --> 41:09.567
What happened?

41:09.641 --> 41:15.443
We agreed that, for his own safety,
Santiago should be transferred off base.

41:15.514 --> 41:19.541
Santiago was set to be transferred.

41:19.618 --> 41:22.212
On the first available flight
to the States...

41:22.287 --> 41:24.414
0600 the next morning.

41:24.490 --> 41:28.586
Five hours too late,
as it turned out.

41:29.862 --> 41:31.295
Yeah.

41:32.865 --> 41:35.231
All right. That's all I have.
Thanks very much for your time.

41:35.300 --> 41:38.599
Corporal's waiting with the Jeep.
He'll take you back to the flight line.

41:38.670 --> 41:40.695
- Thank you, sir.
- Wait. I've got some questions.

41:40.773 --> 41:42.400
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

41:42.474 --> 41:45.466
- No, you don't.
- On the morning that Santiago died...

41:45.544 --> 41:49.139
did you meet with Dr. Stone
between 3:00 and 5:00?

41:49.214 --> 41:53.241
Of course I met with the doctor.
One of my men was dead.

41:53.318 --> 41:55.843
See? The man was dead. Let's go.

41:55.921 --> 41:59.584
I'm just wondering if you’ve ever heard
the term "Code Red. "

42:00.926 --> 42:02.621
I've heard the term, yes.

42:02.694 --> 42:05.686
This past February,
you received a cautionary memo...

42:05.764 --> 42:08.062
from the commander-in-chief
of the Atlantic fleet...

42:08.133 --> 42:10.067
warning that the practice
of enlisted men...

42:10.135 --> 42:13.298
disciplining their own
wasn't to be condoned by officers.

42:13.372 --> 42:15.897
Well, I submit to you
that whoever wrote that memo...

42:15.974 --> 42:17.908
has never faced the working end...

42:17.976 --> 42:22.037
of a Soviet-made
Cuban AK-47 assault rifle.

42:22.114 --> 42:25.811
However, the directive
having come from the commander...

42:25.884 --> 42:28.011
I gave it its due attention.

42:28.087 --> 42:30.647
- What is your point, Jo?
- She has no point.

42:30.722 --> 42:32.656
She often has no point.
It's part of her charm.

42:32.724 --> 42:37.718
- We're out of here. Thank you.
- I think Code Reds still go on here.

42:37.796 --> 42:42.062
- Do Code Reds still happen here?
-Jo, he doesn't need to answer that.

42:42.134 --> 42:43.692
- Yes, he does.
- No, he really doesn't.

42:43.769 --> 42:45.828
Yeah, he really does.

42:50.576 --> 42:52.806
You know, it just hit me.

42:53.879 --> 42:55.813
She outranks you, Danny.

42:55.881 --> 42:58.714
- Yes, sir.
- I wanna tell you something.

42:58.784 --> 43:01.309
And listen up,
'cause I really mean this.

43:01.386 --> 43:04.116
You're the luckiest man
in the world.

43:04.189 --> 43:08.489
There is nothing on this earth sexier-
believe me, gentlemen-

43:08.560 --> 43:11.552
than a woman that
you have to salute in the morning.

43:12.231 --> 43:15.530
Promote 'em all, I say,
'cause this is true:

43:15.601 --> 43:18.729
If you haven't gotten a blowjob
from a superior officer...

43:18.804 --> 43:23.264
well, you’re just letting
the best in life pass you by.

43:24.443 --> 43:27.105
Colonel, the practice of Code Reds
is still condoned by officers-

43:27.179 --> 43:31.616
My problem is that I'm a colonel,
so I'll go on taking cold showers...

43:31.683 --> 43:34.243
until they elect some gal president.

43:34.319 --> 43:36.787
I need an answer to my question, sir.

43:36.855 --> 43:40.416
Take caution in your tone, Commander.

43:40.492 --> 43:45.862
I'm a fair guy, but this fucking heat
is making me absolutely crazy.

43:47.633 --> 43:50.067
You wanna ask me about Code Reds?
On the record...

43:50.135 --> 43:52.126
I tell you I discourage
the practice...

43:52.204 --> 43:54.263
in accordance
with the commander's directive.

43:54.339 --> 43:57.365
Off the record,
I tell you it is an invaluable part...

43:57.442 --> 43:59.376
of close-infantry training.

43:59.444 --> 44:03.380
And if it happens to go on
without my knowledge, so be it.

44:03.448 --> 44:06.474
I run my unit how I run my unit.

44:06.552 --> 44:10.989
You wanna investigate me,
roll the dice and take your chances.

44:11.056 --> 44:15.550
I eat breakfast 300 yards from
4,000 Cubans who are trained to kill me.

44:15.627 --> 44:18.721
So don't think for one second that
you can come down here...

44:18.797 --> 44:20.890
flash a badge...

44:20.966 --> 44:23.560
and make me nervous.

44:27.706 --> 44:28.968
Let's go.

44:31.977 --> 44:35.572
Colonel, I'll just need a copy
of Santiago’s transfer order.

44:36.181 --> 44:37.239
What's that?

44:37.316 --> 44:40.444
Santiago's transfer order. You guys
have paperwork on that kind of thing.

44:40.519 --> 44:42.453
I just need it for the file.

44:42.521 --> 44:45.513
- For the file.
- Yeah.

44:47.659 --> 44:51.993
Of course you can have a copy
of the transfer order for the file.

44:52.064 --> 44:55.329
- I'm here to help in anyway I can.
- Thank you.

44:55.400 --> 44:59.427
You believe that, don’t you, Danny, that
I'm here to help you in anyway I can?

45:00.505 --> 45:01.767
Of course.

45:02.474 --> 45:05.966
Corporal will take you by personnel
on your way out to the flight line...

45:06.044 --> 45:10.276
and you can have
all the transfer orders that you want.

45:11.350 --> 45:14.547
- Let's go.
- But you have to ask me nicely.

45:16.922 --> 45:18.184
I beg your pardon?

45:18.257 --> 45:21.385
You have to ask me nicely.

45:21.460 --> 45:24.861
You see, Danny, I can deal with
the bullets and the bombs and the blood.

45:24.930 --> 45:28.093
I don't want money,
and I don't want medals.

45:28.166 --> 45:32.865
What I do want is for you to stand there
in that faggoty white uniform...

45:32.938 --> 45:37.375
and with your Harvard mouth
extend me some fucking courtesy.

45:40.078 --> 45:42.569
You gotta ask me nicely.

45:46.084 --> 45:48.416
Colonel Jessup,
if it’s not too much trouble...

45:48.487 --> 45:52.389
I'd like a copy
of the transfer order, sir.

45:55.727 --> 45:57.160
No problem.

46:22.220 --> 46:25.587
In the seventh. San Diego leads.
Braves try to comeback.

46:25.657 --> 46:27.921
Runners don’t go.

46:27.993 --> 46:30.757
Hard drive, right field.
We're gonna have a tied ballgame.

46:30.829 --> 46:34.788
It's on its way,
and it is now 10 to 10.

46:34.866 --> 46:36.800
And I don't believe it.

46:40.172 --> 46:42.197
- Who is it?
- It's me.

46:45.010 --> 46:49.140
I really missed you. I was just saying
to myself it’s been almost three hours.

46:49.214 --> 46:52.047
- Markinson's disappeared.
- What?

46:52.117 --> 46:54.881
Colonel Markinson's gone U.A.-
unauthorized absence.

46:54.953 --> 46:56.443
I know what it means.
When?

46:56.521 --> 46:58.785
This afternoon.
Sometime after we left.

46:59.524 --> 47:02.152
- I'll try to find him in the morning.
- I've already tried.

47:02.227 --> 47:03.956
You tried?

47:05.297 --> 47:08.630
Joanne, you're coming dangerously close
to the textbook definition...

47:08.700 --> 47:10.998
of interfering
with a government investigation.

47:11.069 --> 47:12.661
I'm Louden Downey's attorney.

47:13.872 --> 47:17.501
Aunt Ginny. She says she feels
like she's known me for years.

47:17.576 --> 47:19.840
So I suggested that she might feel
more comfortable...

47:19.911 --> 47:22.072
if I were directly involved
with the case.

47:22.147 --> 47:25.548
She had Louden sign the papers
about an hour ago.

47:25.617 --> 47:27.585
I suppose
it's way too much to hope...

47:27.652 --> 47:30.120
that you’re making this up
just to bother me.

47:30.188 --> 47:32.349
Don't worry. I'm not gonna
make a motion for separation.

47:32.424 --> 47:35.291
- You're still lead counsel.
- Splendid.

47:35.360 --> 47:38.193
I think Kendrick ordered the Code Red,
and so do you.

47:40.098 --> 47:41.998
Let's go.

47:45.504 --> 47:47.631
Officer on deck!

47:47.706 --> 47:49.640
- Did Kendrick order the Code Red?
- Sir?

47:49.708 --> 47:53.371
Don't say "Sir" like I just asked you
if you cleaned the latrine.

47:53.445 --> 47:55.709
You heard what I said. Did
Lieutenant Kendrick order you guys...

47:55.781 --> 47:57.806
to give Santiago a Code Red?

47:58.917 --> 48:00.214
Yes, sir.

48:01.753 --> 48:03.983
- Did he?
- Yes, sir.

48:08.960 --> 48:12.020
You mind telling me
why you never mentioned this before?

48:12.097 --> 48:16.158
-You didn't ask.
-That won't win you a place in my heart.

48:16.234 --> 48:18.532
I get paid no matter
how much time you spend in jail.

48:18.603 --> 48:20.662
Yes, sir. I know you do, sir.

48:20.739 --> 48:22.900
- Fuck you, Harold!
- All right.

48:23.942 --> 48:26.410
At ease.

48:26.478 --> 48:28.412
- Let's sort this thing out.
- Shit!

48:28.480 --> 48:31.916
There was a platoon meeting
on September 6 at 4:00 in the afternoon.

48:31.983 --> 48:34.349
Lieutenant Kendrick says
that he gave strict instructions...

48:34.419 --> 48:36.512
that nothing was to happen
to Santiago.

48:36.588 --> 48:39.648
Now, is this true?

48:40.525 --> 48:42.356
I want you to speak freely.

48:45.263 --> 48:46.821
Ma'am, that's correct...

48:46.898 --> 48:49.560
but then he dismissed the platoon
and we all went to our rooms.

48:49.634 --> 48:50.999
And what happened then?

48:51.069 --> 48:53.697
Lieutenant Kendrick came
to our room, ma'am.

48:53.772 --> 48:54.830
When?

48:56.308 --> 49:00.540
About five minutes after the meeting
broke, sir. About 1620.

49:00.612 --> 49:02.239
And what happened then?

49:03.081 --> 49:07.575
Lieutenant Kendrick ordered us
to give Santiago a Code Red.

49:08.954 --> 49:10.046
Jack!

49:10.121 --> 49:12.351
Hang on.

49:12.424 --> 49:13.948
They were given an order.

49:16.862 --> 49:19.023
-Jack, come on.
- Be right back.

49:19.097 --> 49:22.294
- What are you doin', Jack?
- Be right back.

49:22.367 --> 49:25.530
- How long did you know about the order?
- I didn't. Who's this?

49:25.604 --> 49:29.267
That's Jo Galloway, Downey's lawyer.
She's very pleased to meet you.

49:29.341 --> 49:32.504
- What exactly are you accusing me of?
- How long did you know about the order?

49:32.577 --> 49:34.602
He didn't, 'cause if he did
and hadn't told us...

49:34.679 --> 49:37.443
he'd be violating about 14 articles
of the Code of Ethics.

49:37.516 --> 49:38.949
He has enough to worry about...

49:39.017 --> 49:41.110
God forbid our clients
decide to plead not guilty...

49:41.186 --> 49:43.416
and testify for the record
that they were given an order.

49:43.488 --> 49:46.116
Kendrick specifically told those men
not to touch Santiago.

49:46.191 --> 49:48.056
That's right. And then he went
into Dawson and Downey's room...

49:48.126 --> 49:50.117
and specifically told them
to give him a Code Red.

49:50.195 --> 49:52.925
- Kendrick said different. Have proof?
- He's lying. I have the defendants.

49:52.998 --> 49:55.125
And I have 23 Marines
who aren't accused of murder...

49:55.200 --> 49:57.498
and a lieutenant
with four letters of commendation.

49:57.569 --> 49:59.764
- Why did Markinson go U.A.?
- We'll never know.

49:59.838 --> 50:02.830
- You don't think I could subpoena him?
- You can try, but you won't find him.

50:02.908 --> 50:06.776
You know what he did for the first 17
of his 26 years in the Corps?

50:06.845 --> 50:11.305
Counterintelligence. Markinson's gone.
There is no Markinson.

50:12.817 --> 50:14.751
Look, Danny.

50:14.819 --> 50:17.344
Jessup's star is on the rise.

50:17.422 --> 50:19.356
Division will give me
a lot of room on this one...

50:19.424 --> 50:21.619
to spare Jessup
and the Corps any embarrassment.

50:21.693 --> 50:22.853
How much?

50:24.029 --> 50:27.590
Involuntary manslaughter,
two years, they're home in six months.

50:27.666 --> 50:29.133
No deal. We're going to court.

50:29.200 --> 50:31.031
- No, you're not.
- Why not?

50:31.102 --> 50:34.401
'Cause you’ll lose,
and Danny knows it.

50:34.472 --> 50:37.202
If we do go to court,
I'm gonna have to go all the way.

50:37.275 --> 50:39.607
They're gonna be charged
with a whole truckload-

50:39.678 --> 50:42.272
murder, conspiracy,
conduct unbecoming.

50:42.347 --> 50:44.747
Even though he's got me by the balls
out here, Danny knows...

50:44.816 --> 50:47.148
that in a courtroom,
he loses this case.

50:47.218 --> 50:49.152
Danny is an awfully talented lawyer.

50:49.220 --> 50:51.620
He's not about to see
his clients go to jail for life...

50:51.690 --> 50:54.181
when he knows
they can be home in six months.

50:54.926 --> 50:56.860
That's the end of this negotiation.

50:57.762 --> 51:00.128
I'll see you tomorrow morning
at the arraignment.

51:03.535 --> 51:06.436
All right. Here's the story.

51:06.504 --> 51:11.203
The government's offering
involuntary manslaughter, two years.

51:11.276 --> 51:13.210
Be home in six months.

51:15.880 --> 51:19.475
Wow, Kaffee!
You're the greatest lawyer in the world!

51:19.551 --> 51:22.611
Ooh, how can we ever thank you?

51:22.687 --> 51:25.247
Fellas, you hear what I just said?

51:25.323 --> 51:28.588
You're going home in six months.

51:28.660 --> 51:30.992
I'm afraid we can't do that, sir.

51:31.062 --> 51:34.395
- Do what?
- Make a deal, sir.

51:34.466 --> 51:35.933
What are you talking about?

51:36.001 --> 51:38.834
We did nothing wrong, sir.
We did our job...

51:38.903 --> 51:42.066
and if that has consequences,
then I'll accept them.

51:42.140 --> 51:44.540
But I won't say that I'm guilty, sir.

51:45.877 --> 51:49.438
Did you-
Did she put you up to this?

51:49.514 --> 51:53.006
- We have a code, sir.
- Oh, well, zip-a-dee-doo-dah!

51:53.084 --> 51:56.417
You and your code plead not guilty.
You'll be in jail the rest of your life.

51:56.488 --> 51:59.548
Do what I'm telling you,
you'll be home in six months.

52:01.393 --> 52:03.361
Do it, Harold.
Six months.

52:03.428 --> 52:05.953
It's nothing.
It's a hockey season.

52:08.433 --> 52:10.128
- Permission to-
- Speak!

52:10.201 --> 52:12.294
Jesus!

52:14.673 --> 52:17.699
- What do we do then, sir?
- When?

52:17.776 --> 52:20.802
After six months, we'll be
dishonorably discharged, right, sir?

52:20.879 --> 52:22.210
Probably.

52:23.448 --> 52:25.439
Well, what do we do then, sir?

52:28.153 --> 52:32.055
We joined the Marines because we wanted
to live our lives by a certain code.

52:32.123 --> 52:33.886
And we found it in the Corps.

52:33.958 --> 52:37.189
Now you’re asking us to sign a piece
of paper that says we have no honor.

52:37.262 --> 52:39.457
You're asking us
to say we’re not Marines.

52:39.531 --> 52:41.829
If a court decides
that what we did was wrong...

52:41.900 --> 52:43.925
then I'll accept
whatever punishment they give.

52:44.002 --> 52:47.460
But I believe I was right, sir.
I believe I did my job...

52:47.539 --> 52:50.872
and I will not dishonor myself,
my unit or the Corps...

52:50.942 --> 52:55.003
so that I can go home
in six months...

52:55.080 --> 52:56.513
sir.

53:03.722 --> 53:08.523
Commander, I'd like to talk to Lance
Corporal Dawson alone for a minute.

53:10.095 --> 53:11.960
Sergeant.

53:12.030 --> 53:14.555
We're gonna go to another room.

53:14.632 --> 53:16.964
- We'd like another holding room.
- All right, ma'am.

53:17.035 --> 53:19.469
- It's gonna be okay.
- Sit down.

53:30.915 --> 53:32.940
You don't like me very much, do you?

53:34.252 --> 53:37.449
Forget it. Don't answer that.
It doesn't matter.

53:43.661 --> 53:45.094
You know...

53:46.464 --> 53:48.398
Downey worships you.

53:51.136 --> 53:53.627
He's gonna do whatever you do.

53:54.606 --> 53:59.407
Are you really gonna let this happen
to him because of a code, Harold?

53:59.477 --> 54:01.911
- Do you think we were right?
- It doesn't matter-

54:01.980 --> 54:06.041
- Do you think we were right?
- I think you’d lose.

54:08.019 --> 54:09.953
You're such a coward.

54:10.021 --> 54:12.581
I can't believe
they let you wear a uniform.

54:14.959 --> 54:17.587
I'm not gonna feel responsible for this.
I did everything I could.

54:17.662 --> 54:20.187
You're going to Leavenworth
for the better part of your life.

54:20.265 --> 54:22.199
And you know what?
I don't give a shit.

54:24.269 --> 54:27.238
What happened to saluting an officer
when he leaves the room?

54:36.314 --> 54:37.406
Open it up.

54:41.151 --> 54:42.948
I don't believe it.

54:43.019 --> 54:45.419
Dawson's gonna go to jail
just to spite me.

54:45.488 --> 54:48.048
Fine. If he wants to jump
off a cliff, that's his business.

54:48.124 --> 54:51.890
I'm not gonna hold his hand on the way.
I wanna get him a new lawyer. How?

54:51.961 --> 54:54.395
Just make a motion tomorrow morning
at the arraignment.

54:54.464 --> 54:56.455
The judge will ask you
if you want to enter a plea...

54:56.533 --> 54:58.933
and you tell him that you want
to have new counsel assigned.

55:00.470 --> 55:01.903
That's that.

55:01.971 --> 55:05.270
One thing, though. When you ask
the judge for new counsel...

55:05.342 --> 55:07.276
Danny, be sure and ask nicely.

55:08.178 --> 55:10.976
- What do you want from me?
- I want you to let them be judged.

55:11.047 --> 55:13.948
I want you to stand up
and make an argument.

55:14.017 --> 55:16.679
An argument that didn't work
for Calley at My Lai.

55:16.753 --> 55:18.880
An argument that didn't work
for the Nazis at Nuremburg.

55:18.955 --> 55:20.889
Oh, for Christ's sake, Sam.

55:20.957 --> 55:23.391
Do you really think that's the same
as two teenage Marines...

55:23.460 --> 55:26.258
executing a routine order they never
believed would result in harm?

55:26.329 --> 55:28.024
These guys aren't the Nazis.

55:28.098 --> 55:31.158
Don't look now, Danny,
but you’re making an argument.

55:32.769 --> 55:36.296
Yeah, yeah. Tomorrow morning
I get them a new attorney.

55:36.373 --> 55:38.341
Why are you so afraid
to be a lawyer?

55:38.408 --> 55:40.876
Were Daddy's expectations
really that high?

55:40.944 --> 55:44.539
Oh, please. Spare me
the psycho-babble father bullshit!

55:44.614 --> 55:48.015
Dawson and Downey will have their day
in court, but with another lawyer.

55:48.084 --> 55:51.053
Another lawyer won’t be good enough.
They need you.

55:51.121 --> 55:54.682
You know how to win. You know they have
a case, and you know how to win.

55:54.758 --> 55:57.192
If you walk away from this now,
you've sealed their fate.

55:57.260 --> 56:00.627
Their fate was sealed
the moment Santiago died.

56:00.697 --> 56:03.325
- Do you believe they have a case?
- You and Dawson.

56:03.400 --> 56:05.459
You both live
in the same dream world.

56:05.535 --> 56:07.469
It doesn't matter what I believe.

56:07.537 --> 56:09.664
It only matters what I can prove.

56:09.739 --> 56:12.674
So, please, don't tell me
what I know and don't know!

56:12.742 --> 56:14.505
I know the law!

56:19.482 --> 56:21.416
You know nothing about the law.

56:21.484 --> 56:23.679
You're a used car salesman, Daniel.

56:23.753 --> 56:26.244
You're an ambulance chaser
with a rank.

56:26.322 --> 56:29.416
You're nothing. Live with that.

56:35.965 --> 56:37.899
So I told Duncan...

56:37.967 --> 56:42.131
"If you wanna take this to court
I'm gonna file nine discovery motions...

56:42.205 --> 56:45.504
and you're gonna spend a year
going blind on paperwork...

56:45.575 --> 56:49.067
because a 90-year-old man
misread the Delaware insurance code. "

56:49.145 --> 56:51.340
- So what happened?
- He calls back 15 minutes later.

56:51.414 --> 56:53.348
He says, " Let's make a deal. "

57:40.530 --> 57:41.963
All rise.

57:49.472 --> 57:50.564
Where are we?

57:52.242 --> 57:55.803
Docket number 411275VR-5.

57:55.879 --> 57:58.905
The United States v.
Lance Corporal Harold W. Dawson...

57:58.982 --> 58:01.007
and Private First Class Louden Downey.

58:01.084 --> 58:04.212
The accused are charged with murder,
conspiracy to commit murder...

58:04.287 --> 58:06.847
and conduct unbecoming
a United States Marine.

58:06.923 --> 58:09.118
Does the defense wish to enter a plea?

58:10.894 --> 58:12.327
Yeah.

58:16.032 --> 58:17.431
They're not guilty.

58:20.603 --> 58:23.197
Enter a plea of not guilty
for the accused.

58:23.273 --> 58:26.538
We'll adjourn until 1000,
three weeks from today...

58:26.609 --> 58:29.544
at which time this general
court-martial will reconvene.

58:46.129 --> 58:49.587
Why does a lieutenant junior grade
with ninth months' experience...

58:49.666 --> 58:53.033
and a track record for plea bargaining
get assigned a murder case?

58:55.872 --> 58:58.864
Would it be so that it never sees
the inside of a courtroom?

59:01.477 --> 59:03.411
We'll work out of my apartment
every night, 7:00.

59:03.479 --> 59:08.109
Jo, pick up a carton of legal pads, half
a dozen boxes of red and black pens.

59:08.184 --> 59:11.415
Sam, get a couple of desk lamps.
I need a preliminary medical profile.

59:11.487 --> 59:15.924
Jo, we need all proficiency and conduct
reports on Dawson, Downey and Santiago.

59:15.992 --> 59:18.187
The only thing I have to eat
is Yoo-hoo and Cocoa Puffs...

59:18.261 --> 59:20.195
so if you want anything else,
bring it with you.

59:20.263 --> 59:22.424
- Okay?
- Yeah.

59:28.504 --> 59:30.904
So this is what
a courtroom looks like.

59:41.384 --> 59:43.909
Were you able to speak
to your friend at the N.I.S.?

59:44.988 --> 59:48.253
Yeah. She said if Markinson
doesn't want to be found...

59:48.324 --> 59:50.224
we're not gonna find him.

59:50.293 --> 59:53.228
She said I could be Markinson,
and you wouldn't know it.

59:54.797 --> 59:56.356
Are you Markinson?

59:57.257 --> 59:58.357
No.

59:59.135 --> 1:00:01.035
I'm not Markinson.

1:00:02.138 --> 1:00:04.299
That's two down.

1:00:06.109 --> 1:00:07.303
What?

1:00:09.479 --> 1:00:12.778
I'm just wondering,
now that Joanne’s on this-

1:00:12.849 --> 1:00:15.374
I'm just wondering
if you still need me.

1:00:15.451 --> 1:00:18.249
- They were following orders.
- An illegal order.

1:00:18.321 --> 1:00:20.551
Do you think they knew
it was an illegal order?

1:00:20.623 --> 1:00:23.956
It doesn't matter what they knew.
Any decent human being would have refused-

1:00:24.027 --> 1:00:26.291
They're not permitted
to question orders.

1:00:26.362 --> 1:00:29.388
Then what's the secret? Huh?
What are the magic words?

1:00:29.465 --> 1:00:31.057
I give orders every day-

1:00:31.134 --> 1:00:33.068
We have softball games
and marching bands.

1:00:33.136 --> 1:00:37.334
They work at a place where you have to
wear camouflage or you might get shot!

1:00:45.081 --> 1:00:47.140
I need you.

1:00:47.216 --> 1:00:52.153
You're better at research than I am,
and you know how to prepare a witness.

1:00:57.560 --> 1:01:00.688
I've got medical reports
and Chinese food. I say we eat first.

1:01:08.204 --> 1:01:09.262
What?

1:01:11.474 --> 1:01:13.408
You got any kung pao chicken?

1:01:16.779 --> 1:01:20.306
This is our defense- intent. No one
can prove there was poison on the rag.

1:01:20.383 --> 1:01:23.250
Code Red- they're common
and accepted in Guantanamo Bay.

1:01:23.319 --> 1:01:27.688
The order- A: Kendrick gave it,
B: They had to follow it.

1:01:27.757 --> 1:01:29.884
- That's it.
- What about motive?

1:01:29.959 --> 1:01:31.984
We're a little weak on motive.
They had one.

1:01:32.061 --> 1:01:34.222
- Just because a person has a motive
doesn't mean they're guilty. - Relax.

1:01:34.297 --> 1:01:36.663
We'll deal with the fence line shooting
when it comes up.

1:01:36.733 --> 1:01:39.896
Let's start with intent. I don't
want to know what made Santiago die.

1:01:39.969 --> 1:01:42.904
I just want to show it could've been
something other than poison.

1:01:42.972 --> 1:01:46.533
Jo, talk to doctors. Find out everything
there is to know about lactic acidosis.

1:01:46.609 --> 1:01:49.908
This is Lieutenant Commander Galloway
with the JAG Corps in Washington.

1:01:49.979 --> 1:01:53.210
I've been trying to track down
a Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Markinson.

1:01:53.282 --> 1:01:56.115
Doctor, was there any sign
of external damage?

1:01:56.185 --> 1:02:00.679
No scrapes? No cuts?
Bruises? Broken bones?

1:02:00.757 --> 1:02:05.126
- Was there any sign of violence?
- You mean, other than the dead body?

1:02:05.194 --> 1:02:07.958
Shit, I walk into that
every goddamn time.

1:02:08.030 --> 1:02:12.660
He ordered me and Lance Corporal Dawson
to give Willie a Code Red.

1:02:12.735 --> 1:02:14.965
Answers still have to come
much faster.

1:02:15.037 --> 1:02:17.130
This Iowa farm boy thing
will play for a while...

1:02:17.206 --> 1:02:19.606
but in the end, it sounds
like he's searching for the truth.

1:02:19.675 --> 1:02:21.939
He's right. From now on,
Willie is Private Santiago.

1:02:22.011 --> 1:02:24.343
You start calling him Willie,
and all of a sudden he's a person...

1:02:24.413 --> 1:02:26.643
who's got a mother
who's gonna miss him, okay?

1:02:26.716 --> 1:02:28.650
They drew the court members
this afternoon.

1:02:28.718 --> 1:02:31.016
Seven men, two women,
five Navy, four Marines.

1:02:31.087 --> 1:02:33.612
All officers with line experience.
Neither of the women have children.

1:02:33.689 --> 1:02:35.987
That's a bad break.
There’s nothing we can do.

1:02:36.058 --> 1:02:38.822
My father always said a jury trial
is not just about the law.

1:02:38.895 --> 1:02:42.058
It's about assigning blame.
Santiago's dead, and he shouldn't be.

1:02:42.131 --> 1:02:44.998
These nine people are gonna insist
that someone be blamed for that.

1:02:45.067 --> 1:02:47.535
Ross is handing them our clients.
We're gonna hand them Kendrick.

1:02:47.603 --> 1:02:51.130
This is about a sales pitch. It's not going to be won
by the law. It's gonna be won by the lawyers.

1:02:51.207 --> 1:02:54.506
So remember, poker faces. Don’t flinch
in front of the court members.

1:02:54.577 --> 1:02:58.343
Something doesn't go our way, don't hang
your head or shift in your seat.

1:02:58.414 --> 1:03:02.145
Whatever happens, you have to look like
it's exactly what you knew would happen.

1:03:02.218 --> 1:03:06.814
- If you pass me documents-
- Do it swiftly and don't look eager.

1:03:06.889 --> 1:03:10.154
Don't wear that perfume in court.
Wrecks my concentration.

1:03:10.226 --> 1:03:11.659
Really?

1:03:11.727 --> 1:03:14.059
I was talking to Sam.

1:03:15.431 --> 1:03:16.830
What time is it?

1:03:16.899 --> 1:03:18.890
It's time to go home.
Try to get some sleep tonight.

1:03:18.968 --> 1:03:20.993
- Yeah.
- Give me a ride?

1:03:21.070 --> 1:03:22.503
Sure.

1:03:25.474 --> 1:03:27.635
You're a good man, Charlie Brown.

1:03:27.710 --> 1:03:30.201
I'll see you in court, counselor.

1:03:36.953 --> 1:03:39.148
- Danny, I-
- You don't have to say it.

1:03:39.222 --> 1:03:41.622
We've had our differences.
I said some things I didn't mean.

1:03:41.691 --> 1:03:45.058
You said some things you didn't mean,
but you’re happy I stuck with the case.

1:03:45.127 --> 1:03:49.530
And if you’ve gained a certain respect
for me over the last three weeks...

1:03:49.599 --> 1:03:51.658
of course, I'm happy about that.

1:03:51.734 --> 1:03:53.827
But we don't have to make
a whole big deal out of it.

1:03:53.903 --> 1:03:56.167
If you like me,
I won't make you say it.

1:03:56.239 --> 1:03:59.675
I was just gonna tell you
to wear matching socks tomorrow.

1:04:01.544 --> 1:04:04.877
Okay. Good tip.

1:04:05.715 --> 1:04:06.977
We're ready.

1:04:07.049 --> 1:04:09.483
Better believe it.

1:04:19.395 --> 1:04:21.329
We're gonna get creamed.

1:04:50.793 --> 1:04:52.920
- Lieutenant Kaffee?
- Yes?

1:04:52.995 --> 1:04:55.361
You are gonna save our son,
aren’t you?

1:04:56.432 --> 1:04:57.763
I'll do my best.

1:04:58.534 --> 1:05:03.198
Danny, I'd like you to meet
Ginny Miller, Louden's aunt.

1:05:04.206 --> 1:05:07.175
- You're Aunt Ginny?
- Uh-huh.

1:05:08.377 --> 1:05:11.540
I'm sorry. I was expecting
someone older.

1:05:11.614 --> 1:05:13.343
So was I.

1:05:17.420 --> 1:05:19.445
Last chance.
I'll flip you for it.

1:05:19.522 --> 1:05:21.956
- All rise.
- Too late.

1:05:30.466 --> 1:05:33.629
All those having business
with this general court-martial...

1:05:33.703 --> 1:05:36.263
stand forward
and you shall be heard.

1:05:36.339 --> 1:05:39.797
Colonel Julius Alexander Randolph
is presiding.

1:05:39.875 --> 1:05:42.435
Is the government prepared
to make an opening statement?

1:05:42.511 --> 1:05:43.944
Yes, sir.

1:05:47.249 --> 1:05:49.308
The facts of the case are these:

1:05:49.385 --> 1:05:52.183
On midnight of September 6,
the accused entered the barracks room...

1:05:52.254 --> 1:05:55.223
of their platoon mate,
P.F.C. William Santiago.

1:05:55.291 --> 1:05:58.385
They woke him up,
tied his arms and legs with tape...

1:05:58.461 --> 1:06:00.725
and forced a rag into his throat.

1:06:00.796 --> 1:06:04.391
A few minutes later, a chemical reaction
called lactic acidosis...

1:06:04.467 --> 1:06:06.594
caused his lungs to begin bleeding.

1:06:06.669 --> 1:06:08.603
He drowned in his own blood...

1:06:08.671 --> 1:06:12.300
and was pronounced dead
at 37 minutes past midnight.

1:06:12.375 --> 1:06:17.403
These are the facts of the case,
and they are undisputed.

1:06:17.480 --> 1:06:21.109
That's right.
The story I’ve just told you...

1:06:21.183 --> 1:06:24.744
is the exact same story you’re gonna
hear from Lance Corporal Dawson...

1:06:24.820 --> 1:06:27.550
and it's the exact same story
you're gonna hear from Private Downey.

1:06:27.623 --> 1:06:30.319
Furthermore, the government
will also demonstrate...

1:06:30.393 --> 1:06:32.827
that the accused
soaked the rag in poison...

1:06:32.895 --> 1:06:36.991
and entered Santiago's room
with motive and intent to kill.

1:06:38.401 --> 1:06:40.426
Now, Lieutenant Kaffee...

1:06:40.503 --> 1:06:43.597
is gonna try and pull off
a little magic act here.

1:06:43.672 --> 1:06:46.163
He's gonna try a little misdirection.

1:06:46.242 --> 1:06:49.973
He's gonna astonish you
with stories of rituals...

1:06:50.046 --> 1:06:52.947
and dazzle you
with official-sounding terms...

1:06:53.015 --> 1:06:54.949
like "Code Red. "

1:06:56.118 --> 1:06:59.349
He might even try to cut into
a few officers for you.

1:06:59.422 --> 1:07:04.291
He'll have no evidence, mind you, none,
but it's gonna be entertaining.

1:07:04.360 --> 1:07:07.852
And when we get to the end,
all the magic in the world...

1:07:07.930 --> 1:07:10.626
will not have been able to divert
your attention from the fact...

1:07:10.699 --> 1:07:16.194
that Willie Santiago is dead
and Dawson and Downey killed him.

1:07:17.740 --> 1:07:21.232
These are the facts of the case,
and they are undisputed.

1:07:23.045 --> 1:07:24.637
Lieutenant Kaffee.

1:07:24.713 --> 1:07:27.614
There was no poison on the rag,
and there was no intent to kill.

1:07:27.683 --> 1:07:32.416
Any attempt to prove otherwise is futile
'cause it just ain't true.

1:07:32.488 --> 1:07:35.719
When Dawson and Downey went
into Santiago's room that night...

1:07:35.791 --> 1:07:38.385
it wasn't because of vengeance
or hatred.

1:07:38.461 --> 1:07:42.158
It wasn't to kill or harm, and it wasn't
because they were looking for kicks.

1:07:42.231 --> 1:07:44.961
It's because it was
what they were ordered to do.

1:07:46.368 --> 1:07:47.801
Let me say that again.

1:07:47.870 --> 1:07:50.930
It's because it was
what they were ordered to do.

1:07:51.907 --> 1:07:53.602
Out in the real world
that means nothing...

1:07:53.676 --> 1:07:57.840
and here at the Washington Navy Yard
it doesn't mean a whole lot more.

1:07:57.913 --> 1:08:01.872
But if you’re a Marine assigned
to Rifle Security Company Windward...

1:08:01.951 --> 1:08:04.886
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba,
and you're given an order...

1:08:04.954 --> 1:08:07.548
you follow it
or you pack your bags.

1:08:07.623 --> 1:08:09.614
Make no mistake about it.

1:08:09.692 --> 1:08:12.957
Harold Dawson and Louden Downey
are sitting before you today...

1:08:13.028 --> 1:08:16.395
because they did their job.

1:08:19.902 --> 1:08:22.200
Is the government ready
to call its first witness?

1:08:23.339 --> 1:08:26.934
If it please the court,
the government calls Mr. R.C. McGuire.

1:08:31.380 --> 1:08:33.575
Mr. McGuire, would you
raise your right hand, please?

1:08:33.649 --> 1:08:36.413
Do you solemnly swear that the testimony
you give this general court-martial...

1:08:36.485 --> 1:08:39.420
will be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

1:08:39.488 --> 1:08:42.821
- I do.
- Have a seat, please, sir.

1:08:42.892 --> 1:08:46.259
Would you state your full name
and occupation, for the record?

1:08:46.328 --> 1:08:50.765
Robert C. McGuire, Special Agent,
Naval Investigative Service.

1:08:50.833 --> 1:08:55.133
Mr. McGuire, did your office receive
a letter from P.F.C. William Santiago...

1:08:55.204 --> 1:08:57.331
on 3 September of this year?

1:08:57.406 --> 1:08:59.704
- We did.
- What did that letter say?

1:08:59.775 --> 1:09:04.439
That a member of Santiago’s unit had
illegally fired his weapon over the fence line.

1:09:04.513 --> 1:09:06.640
Was that Marine
identified in the letter?

1:09:06.715 --> 1:09:10.242
No. I notified the barracks C.O.
Colonel Jessup...

1:09:10.319 --> 1:09:12.344
that I would be coming down
to investigate.

1:09:12.421 --> 1:09:14.150
And what did you find?

1:09:14.223 --> 1:09:17.283
The shift reported only one sentry
returned his weapon to the switch...

1:09:17.359 --> 1:09:19.350
with a round of ammunition missing.

1:09:19.428 --> 1:09:22.659
- Who was that?
- Lance Corporal Harold Dawson.

1:09:22.731 --> 1:09:24.323
Your witness.

1:09:27.002 --> 1:09:30.233
Mr. McGuire, have you questioned Dawson
about the fence line shooting?

1:09:30.306 --> 1:09:34.265
Yes. He claims to have been engaged
in some manner by the enemy.

1:09:34.343 --> 1:09:36.538
- You don' believe him?
- It's not my place-

1:09:36.612 --> 1:09:38.842
Lance Corporal Dawson's been charged
with a number of crimes.

1:09:38.914 --> 1:09:41.576
Why wasn’t he charged with firing
at the enemy without cause?

1:09:43.352 --> 1:09:46.253
There wasn't enough evidence
to support such a charge.

1:09:46.322 --> 1:09:48.256
Thank you.

1:09:49.325 --> 1:09:51.452
Mr. McGuire, I don't understand
what you mean when you say...

1:09:51.527 --> 1:09:54.121
"There wasn't enough evidence
to support such a charge. "

1:09:54.196 --> 1:09:56.494
You had William Santiago's letter.

1:09:57.766 --> 1:09:59.700
Santiago was the only eyewitness.

1:09:59.768 --> 1:10:03.204
I never had the chance to interview him,
so I don't know what he saw.

1:10:03.272 --> 1:10:06.332
And now we'll never know,
will we, Mr. McGuire?

1:10:10.045 --> 1:10:12.980
- No more questions.
- The witness is excused.

1:10:17.019 --> 1:10:19.715
Corporal Carl Edward Hammaker,
Marine Barracks...

1:10:19.788 --> 1:10:23.053
Rifle Security Company Windward,
Second Platoon Bravo.

1:10:23.125 --> 1:10:26.561
Corporal, were you present at a meeting
that Lieutenant Kendrick held...

1:10:26.629 --> 1:10:29.996
on the afternoon of September 6
with the members of the Second Platoon?

1:10:30.065 --> 1:10:31.362
Yes, sir.

1:10:31.433 --> 1:10:34.027
Would you tell the court
the substance of that meeting?

1:10:34.103 --> 1:10:37.266
Lieutenant Kendrick told us
we had an informer in our group-

1:10:37.339 --> 1:10:40.035
that Private Santiago had gone
outside the chain of command...

1:10:40.109 --> 1:10:43.044
and reported to the N.I.S.
on a member of our platoon.

1:10:43.112 --> 1:10:47.014
Did that make you mad?
You can tell the truth, Corporal.

1:10:47.082 --> 1:10:48.913
- Did it make you mad?
- Yes, sir.

1:10:48.984 --> 1:10:50.212
How mad?

1:10:50.286 --> 1:10:54.120
Private Santiago betrayed a code
we believe in very deeply, sir.

1:10:54.189 --> 1:10:57.181
- Were the other squad members angry?
- Object. Speculation.

1:10:57.259 --> 1:10:59.454
- Were Dawson and Downey?
- Is the government counsel...

1:10:59.528 --> 1:11:04.090
honestly asking the witness to testify
as to how my clients felt?

1:11:04.166 --> 1:11:06.100
Sustained.

1:11:07.936 --> 1:11:11.895
Corporal, did Lieutenant Kendrick
leave a standing order at that meeting?

1:11:11.974 --> 1:11:14.067
- Yes, sir.
- What was it?

1:11:15.844 --> 1:11:19.871
Well, it was clear that he didn't want
us taking matters into our own hands.

1:11:19.948 --> 1:11:21.939
What was the order?

1:11:23.819 --> 1:11:26.788
Sir, he said Santiago
wasn't to be touched.

1:11:28.357 --> 1:11:29.949
Your witness.

1:11:31.026 --> 1:11:33.017
Corporal Hammaker, were you
in Dawson and Downey's barracks...

1:11:33.095 --> 1:11:34.926
five minutes after this meeting?

1:11:34.997 --> 1:11:36.555
No, sir.

1:11:36.632 --> 1:11:39.294
Thanks.
I have no more questions.

1:11:39.368 --> 1:11:41.427
The witness is excused.

1:11:45.274 --> 1:11:47.572
The government calls
Corporal Raymond Thomas.

1:11:47.643 --> 1:11:50.874
I understand Captain Ross is planning
on calling all the other members...

1:11:50.946 --> 1:11:53.574
of Rifle Security Company Windward
to testify.

1:11:53.649 --> 1:11:55.844
In light of the defense Lieutenant
Kaffee is planning to mount...

1:11:55.918 --> 1:11:59.854
the explicit instructions of a platoon
leader seems particularly relevant.

1:11:59.922 --> 1:12:02.447
The defense is willing to concede
that all 22 witnesses...

1:12:02.524 --> 1:12:04.822
will testify substantially
as Corporal Hammaker did...

1:12:04.893 --> 1:12:07.259
if the government is willing to concede
that none of them...

1:12:07.329 --> 1:12:10.958
were in Dawson and Downey's room
at 16:20 on September 6.

1:12:11.033 --> 1:12:12.967
Captain?

1:12:13.035 --> 1:12:15.503
The government will stipulate.

1:12:15.571 --> 1:12:19.530
Then we'll adjourn for the day.
You can call your next witness tomorrow.

1:12:19.608 --> 1:12:21.542
All rise.

1:12:33.021 --> 1:12:34.955
I want to go over the doctor again.

1:12:35.023 --> 1:12:37.890
- We're taking the right approach.
- We've been over this already.

1:12:37.960 --> 1:12:41.555
Listen to me. 3:00- Stone says
he doesn't know what killed Santiago.

1:12:41.630 --> 1:12:45.327
Then he meets with Jessup,
and at 5:00 he says it was poison?

1:12:45.401 --> 1:12:48.131
- The doctor's not telling the truth.
- Oh, that's a relief!.

1:12:48.203 --> 1:12:51.297
I was afraid I wouldn't be able to use
the "liar, liar, pants on fire" defense.

1:12:51.373 --> 1:12:56.208
We can't prove coercion.
Let's go over what we have, okay?

1:13:06.555 --> 1:13:10.218
Private Santiago was admitted
to the E.R. at 0012...

1:13:10.292 --> 1:13:13.819
and he was pronounced dead
at 0037.

1:13:13.896 --> 1:13:17.093
Dr. Stone, what is lactic acidosis?

1:13:17.166 --> 1:13:20.294
If the muscles and other cells
of the body burn sugar...

1:13:20.369 --> 1:13:23.236
instead of oxygen,
lactic acid is produced.

1:13:23.305 --> 1:13:26.741
That lactic acid is what caused
Santiago's lungs to bleed.

1:13:26.809 --> 1:13:29.744
Normally, how long does it take
for the muscles and other cells...

1:13:29.812 --> 1:13:32.246
to begin burning sugar
instead of oxygen?

1:13:32.314 --> 1:13:34.874
Twenty to thirty minutes.

1:13:34.950 --> 1:13:38.681
And what caused this process
to be sped up in Santiago's muscles?

1:13:38.754 --> 1:13:40.915
An ingested poison of some kind.

1:13:40.989 --> 1:13:44.049
Your Honor, we object at this point.
The witness is speculating.

1:13:44.126 --> 1:13:46.185
Commander Stone is an expert
medical witness.

1:13:46.261 --> 1:13:48.729
In this courtroom, his opinion
is not considered speculation.

1:13:48.797 --> 1:13:51.789
Commander Stone is an internist,
not a criminologist.

1:13:51.867 --> 1:13:54.427
The medical facts here
are ultimately inconclusive.

1:13:54.503 --> 1:13:58.200
A point I'm confident you’ll illustrate
to the court under cross-examination.

1:13:58.273 --> 1:14:01.436
So I'm sure you won't mind
if his opinion is admitted now.

1:14:01.510 --> 1:14:03.273
Not at all, sir.

1:14:05.781 --> 1:14:09.945
Dr. Stone, did Willie Santiago
die of poisoning?

1:14:10.018 --> 1:14:11.713
Absolutely.

1:14:11.787 --> 1:14:15.883
You're aware that the lab and coroner's
report show no traces of poison?

1:14:15.958 --> 1:14:18.483
- Yes, I am.
- Then how do you justify-

1:14:18.560 --> 1:14:21.529
There are literally dozens of toxins
which are virtually undetectable...

1:14:21.597 --> 1:14:24.259
both in the human body
and on a fabric.

1:14:24.333 --> 1:14:27.996
The nature of the acidosis
is the compelling factor on this issue.

1:14:28.871 --> 1:14:30.771
Thank you, sir.

1:14:32.708 --> 1:14:36.041
Commander, is it possible for a person
to have an affliction-

1:14:36.111 --> 1:14:40.480
some sort of condition- which might
speed up the process of acidosis?

1:14:43.218 --> 1:14:45.083
Commander, is it possible?

1:14:45.153 --> 1:14:47.018
It's possible.

1:14:47.089 --> 1:14:49.489
What might some of those
conditions be?

1:14:50.559 --> 1:14:53.050
If a person had a coronary disorder...

1:14:53.128 --> 1:14:56.188
or a cerebral disorder,
the process would be more rapid.

1:14:56.265 --> 1:15:00.292
If I had a coronary condition and
a clean rag was placed in my mouth...

1:15:00.369 --> 1:15:04.135
and the rag was pushed too far down,
is it possible that my cells...

1:15:04.206 --> 1:15:06.970
would continue burning sugar
after the rag was taken out?

1:15:07.042 --> 1:15:09.943
It would have to be
a very serious condition.

1:15:10.012 --> 1:15:12.276
Is it possible to have
a serious coronary condition...

1:15:12.347 --> 1:15:15.783
where the warning signals were so mild
as to escape a physician...

1:15:15.851 --> 1:15:18.376
during a routine medical exam?

1:15:18.453 --> 1:15:21.718
Possibly. There would still
be symptoms, though.

1:15:21.790 --> 1:15:24.122
- What kind of symptoms?
- There are hundreds-

1:15:24.192 --> 1:15:26.490
- Chest pains?
- Yes.

1:15:26.562 --> 1:15:28.496
- Shortness of breath?
- Yes.

1:15:28.564 --> 1:15:30.998
- Fatigue?
- Of course.

1:15:36.605 --> 1:15:38.539
Doctor, is this your signature?

1:15:40.175 --> 1:15:41.301
Yes, it is.

1:15:42.044 --> 1:15:45.707
This is an order for Private Santiago
to be put on restrictive duty.

1:15:45.781 --> 1:15:49.717
Would you read your handwritten remarks
at the bottom of the page, please?

1:15:49.785 --> 1:15:53.983
"Initial testing, negative.
Patient complains of chest pains...

1:15:54.056 --> 1:15:56.217
shortness of breath and fatigue.

1:15:56.291 --> 1:16:00.022
Restricted from running distances
over five miles for one week. "

1:16:02.864 --> 1:16:06.391
Commander, isn't it possible that Santiago
had a serious coronary condition...

1:16:06.468 --> 1:16:11.405
and it was that condition, and not some mysterious poison,
that caused the accelerated chemical reaction?

1:16:11.406 --> 1:16:12.406
No.

1:16:13.075 --> 1:16:14.702
It's not possible?

1:16:14.703 --> 1:16:15.703
No.

1:16:16.178 --> 1:16:19.739
I personally give each man
a thorough physical examination.

1:16:19.815 --> 1:16:22.909
Private Santiago was given
a clean bill of health.

1:16:22.985 --> 1:16:25.545
That's why it had to be poison,
right, Commander?

1:16:25.621 --> 1:16:29.717
'Cause if you put a man with a serious
coronary condition on duty...

1:16:29.791 --> 1:16:32.225
and that man died
from a heart-related incident...

1:16:32.294 --> 1:16:34.285
you'd have a lot to answer for,
wouldn’t you, Doctor?

1:16:34.363 --> 1:16:37.389
- Object! Move to strike.
- Sustained.

1:16:38.667 --> 1:16:40.658
I have no more questions,
Your Honor.

1:16:42.004 --> 1:16:45.405
Dr. Stone, you've held
a medical license for 17 years.

1:16:45.474 --> 1:16:47.635
You're Board-certified
in internal medicine.

1:16:47.709 --> 1:16:53.272
You are chief of internal medicine
at a hospital which serves 5,426 people.

1:16:53.348 --> 1:16:58.217
In your professional medical opinion,
was Willie Santiago poisoned?

1:16:58.286 --> 1:17:01.016
We renew our objection
to Commander Stone's testimony...

1:17:01.089 --> 1:17:03.216
and ask that it be stricken
from the record.

1:17:03.291 --> 1:17:07.227
We further ask the court members to lend
no weight to this witness's testimony.

1:17:07.295 --> 1:17:08.956
The objection is overruled.

1:17:09.031 --> 1:17:13.127
The defense strenuously objects
and requests an 802 conference...

1:17:13.201 --> 1:17:17.331
so that His Honor might have a chance
to hear discussion before ruling.

1:17:17.406 --> 1:17:20.898
The objection of the defense
has been heard and overruled.

1:17:20.976 --> 1:17:23.672
- Move to reconsider.
- Your objection is noted.

1:17:23.745 --> 1:17:27.647
The witness is an expert,
and the court will hear his opinion!

1:17:31.953 --> 1:17:36.788
Dr. Stone, in your expert,
professional opinion...

1:17:36.858 --> 1:17:39.588
was Willie Santiago poisoned?

1:17:39.661 --> 1:17:41.629
Yes.

1:17:41.697 --> 1:17:45.428
Thank you, sir.
I have no more questions.

1:17:45.500 --> 1:17:47.593
Commander, you may step down.

1:17:52.140 --> 1:17:56.372
Please the court, while we reserve
the right to call rebuttal witnesses...

1:17:56.445 --> 1:17:58.208
the government rests.

1:17:58.280 --> 1:18:01.875
We'll stand in recess until 1000,
Monday the 19th...

1:18:01.950 --> 1:18:05.386
at which time, the defense
will call its first witness.

1:18:05.454 --> 1:18:07.388
All rise.

1:18:16.498 --> 1:18:18.625
"I strenuously object"?

1:18:18.700 --> 1:18:22.932
Is that how it works?
"Objection overruled. "

1:18:23.004 --> 1:18:25.165
" No, no. I strenuously object. "

1:18:25.240 --> 1:18:28.698
"Oh, well, if you strenuously object,
then I should take time to reconsider. "

1:18:28.777 --> 1:18:30.369
I got it on the record.

1:18:30.445 --> 1:18:32.640
You also got the court members
thinking we're afraid of the doctor.

1:18:32.714 --> 1:18:35.410
You object once, so they can hear us say
he's not a criminologist.

1:18:35.484 --> 1:18:39.113
You keep after it, and suddenly it looks
like a bunch of fancy lawyer tricks.

1:18:39.187 --> 1:18:42.281
It's the difference between paper law
and trial law.

1:18:42.357 --> 1:18:44.825
You even had the judge saying
Stone was an expert!

1:18:44.893 --> 1:18:47.760
She made a mistake.
Let's not relive it.

1:18:49.498 --> 1:18:53.059
I'm gonna go call my wife.
I'll see you tonight.

1:18:55.203 --> 1:18:57.603
Why do you hate them so much?

1:18:57.672 --> 1:19:00.140
They beat up on a weakling.
That's all they did.

1:19:00.208 --> 1:19:03.234
The rest of this is just
smoke-filled coffeehouse crap.

1:19:03.311 --> 1:19:06.439
They tortured and tormented
a weaker kid!

1:19:06.515 --> 1:19:08.540
They didn't like him,
so they killed him.

1:19:08.617 --> 1:19:11.518
And why? Because
he couldn't run very fast!

1:19:11.586 --> 1:19:15.249
All right.
Everybody take the night off.

1:19:15.323 --> 1:19:17.257
- I'm sorry.
- I know.

1:19:17.325 --> 1:19:20.089
We've been working 20 hours a day
for three and half weeks straight.

1:19:20.162 --> 1:19:23.529
Just take the night off.
Go see your wife, your daughter.

1:19:23.598 --> 1:19:25.759
Jo, go do...

1:19:27.102 --> 1:19:30.629
whatever it is you do
when you're not here.

1:19:30.705 --> 1:19:33.401
- What day is tomorrow?
- Saturday.

1:19:33.475 --> 1:19:35.409
We start at 10:00.

1:19:39.414 --> 1:19:41.746
Why do you like them so much?

1:19:45.987 --> 1:19:48.182
'Cause they stand on a wall...

1:19:48.256 --> 1:19:52.488
and they say, " Nothing's gonna hurt you
tonight, not on my watch. "

1:19:57.098 --> 1:20:00.431
Don't worry about the doctor.
This trial starts Monday.

1:20:05.440 --> 1:20:09.638
One and two, with two out.
And a line drive to left center.

1:20:09.711 --> 1:20:12.942
Kirby racing.
He won’t get there.

1:20:13.014 --> 1:20:16.142
And rounding third is Cal Ripken...

1:20:16.218 --> 1:20:19.381
and the Twins' streak is over.

1:20:22.591 --> 1:20:26.357
One strike away, and Randy Milligan
feels right now like Hulk Hogan.

1:20:29.497 --> 1:20:32.625
I'm sorry to bother you.
I should've called first.

1:20:32.701 --> 1:20:37.070
No, I was just watching
a ball game. Come on in.

1:20:51.987 --> 1:20:57.448
I was wondering if- How you’d feel
about my taking you to dinner tonight?

1:20:57.525 --> 1:21:00.517
- Are you asking me out on a date?
- No.

1:21:00.595 --> 1:21:02.620
Sounded like you
were asking me on a date.

1:21:02.697 --> 1:21:05.723
I've been asked out on dates before,
and that's what it sounded like.

1:21:07.002 --> 1:21:09.163
Do you like seafood?
I know a good seafood place.

1:21:18.013 --> 1:21:20.072
My third case was
a drunk and disorderly.

1:21:20.148 --> 1:21:24.016
It lasted nine weeks. I rounded up
31 people from the bar that night.

1:21:24.085 --> 1:21:27.521
Nine weeks on a D and D?
What was the prosecutor offering?

1:21:27.589 --> 1:21:29.523
Fifteen days.

1:21:32.327 --> 1:21:33.988
You sure hustled
the shit out of him.

1:21:34.062 --> 1:21:36.428
Well, after that
they moved me to Internal Affairs.

1:21:36.498 --> 1:21:38.489
- Tough to blame them.
- Where I have earned...

1:21:38.566 --> 1:21:42.263
two meritorious service medals
and two letters of commendation.

1:21:42.337 --> 1:21:45.363
Why are you always giving me
your resume?

1:21:49.244 --> 1:21:51.178
Because I want you to think
I'm a good lawyer.

1:21:51.246 --> 1:21:53.271
I do.

1:21:53.348 --> 1:21:55.543
No, you don't.

1:21:58.987 --> 1:22:01.251
I think you’re an exceptional lawyer.

1:22:02.057 --> 1:22:06.687
I watch the court members.
They respond to you. They like you.

1:22:06.761 --> 1:22:09.389
I see you convincing them,
and I think Dawson and Downey...

1:22:09.464 --> 1:22:12.126
are gonna end up
owing their lives to you.

1:22:15.770 --> 1:22:17.704
Jo, I think-

1:22:19.407 --> 1:22:23.070
I think you should prepare yourself
for the fact that we're gonna lose.

1:22:23.144 --> 1:22:26.511
Ross's opening statement-
it was all true.

1:22:26.581 --> 1:22:29.345
Let's pretend for a minute
that it would actually matter...

1:22:29.417 --> 1:22:31.510
that the guys
were given an order.

1:22:31.586 --> 1:22:34.214
I can't prove it ever happened.

1:22:34.289 --> 1:22:36.780
We'll keep doing what we're doing
and we'll put on a show...

1:22:36.858 --> 1:22:42.262
but all we have is the testimony
of two people accused of murder.

1:22:43.465 --> 1:22:45.330
We'll find Markinson.

1:22:45.400 --> 1:22:49.894
Jo, we're gonna lose,
and we're gonna lose huge.

1:22:53.108 --> 1:22:56.407
Corporal Jeffrey Owen Barnes,
Marine Barracks Windward...

1:22:56.478 --> 1:22:58.503
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

1:22:58.580 --> 1:23:02.914
Corporal Barnes, name some reasons
why a Marine would receive a Code Red.

1:23:02.984 --> 1:23:06.385
Being late for platoon
or company meetings.

1:23:06.454 --> 1:23:10.356
Keeping his barracks in disorder.
Falling back on a run.

1:23:10.425 --> 1:23:12.916
- Have you ever received a Code Red?
- Yes, sir.

1:23:12.994 --> 1:23:16.555
We were doing seven-man assault drills,
and my weapon slipped.

1:23:16.631 --> 1:23:19.930
It was 'cause it was over 100 degrees,
and my palms were sweaty...

1:23:20.001 --> 1:23:23.664
and I'd forgotten to use the resin
like we were taught.

1:23:23.738 --> 1:23:25.262
What happened?

1:23:25.340 --> 1:23:28.400
That night, the guys in my squad
threw a blanket over me...

1:23:28.476 --> 1:23:31.309
took turns punching me in the arm
for five minutes...

1:23:31.379 --> 1:23:33.973
then they poured glue on my hands.

1:23:34.049 --> 1:23:37.746
And it worked too, 'cause
I ain't never dropped my weapon since.

1:23:39.220 --> 1:23:42.280
Was Private Santiago ever late
for platoon meetings?

1:23:42.357 --> 1:23:43.517
Yes, sir.

1:23:43.591 --> 1:23:45.957
- Was his barracks ever in disorder?
- Yes, sir.

1:23:46.027 --> 1:23:48.359
- Did he ever fall back on a run?
- All the time, sir.

1:23:48.430 --> 1:23:53.800
Did he ever, prior to the night
of September 6, receive a Code Red?

1:23:53.868 --> 1:23:55.358
No, sir.

1:23:55.437 --> 1:23:57.496
- Never?
- No, sir.

1:23:59.174 --> 1:24:01.540
You got a Code Red
'cause your palms were sweaty.

1:24:01.609 --> 1:24:05.670
Why didn't Santiago,
this burden to his unit, ever get one?

1:24:07.148 --> 1:24:09.173
Dawson wouldn't allow it, sir.

1:24:10.285 --> 1:24:12.344
Dawson wouldn't allow it.

1:24:12.420 --> 1:24:16.015
The guys talked tough about Santiago,
but they wouldn’t go near him.

1:24:16.091 --> 1:24:18.025
They were too afraid of Dawson.

1:24:18.093 --> 1:24:20.561
Object.
The witness is speculating.

1:24:20.628 --> 1:24:24.291
I'll rephrase. Jeffrey, did you ever
want to give Santiago a Code Red?

1:24:24.365 --> 1:24:26.333
- Yes, sir.
- Why didn’t you?

1:24:26.401 --> 1:24:29.199
'Cause Dawson
would kick my butt, sir.

1:24:29.270 --> 1:24:33.206
Good enough. Captain Ross
is gonna ask you some questions now.

1:24:34.576 --> 1:24:36.510
Corporal Barnes...

1:24:37.979 --> 1:24:40.470
I hold here the Marine Outline
for Recruit Training.

1:24:40.548 --> 1:24:42.311
- Are you familiar with this book?
- Yes, sir.

1:24:42.383 --> 1:24:44.044
- Have you read it?
- Yes, sir.

1:24:44.119 --> 1:24:47.418
Would you turn to the chapter
that deals with Code Reds, please?

1:24:49.991 --> 1:24:53.552
Just flip to the page of the book
that discusses Code Reds.

1:24:55.830 --> 1:24:59.288
Well, you see, sir, Code Red
is a term that we use.

1:24:59.367 --> 1:25:01.062
Just down in Gitmo-

1:25:01.136 --> 1:25:03.229
Oh, we're in luck, then.

1:25:06.541 --> 1:25:10.978
Standard Operating Procedure, Rifle
Security Company, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

1:25:11.045 --> 1:25:15.038
I assume we'll find the term Code Red
and its definition in that book.

1:25:15.116 --> 1:25:16.981
No, sir.

1:25:17.051 --> 1:25:18.848
Corporal Barnes, I'm a Marine.

1:25:18.920 --> 1:25:23.050
Is there no book, no manual or pamphlet,
no set of orders or regulations...

1:25:23.124 --> 1:25:27.652
that lets me know that as a Marine one
of my duties is to perform Code Reds?

1:25:27.729 --> 1:25:31.165
No, sir.
No book, sir.

1:25:31.232 --> 1:25:33.166
No further questions.

1:25:35.236 --> 1:25:37.796
Corporal, would you turn
to the page in this book...

1:25:37.872 --> 1:25:40.272
that says where
the mess hall is, please?

1:25:40.341 --> 1:25:43.435
Lieutenant Kaffee,
that's not in the book, sir.

1:25:44.979 --> 1:25:47.914
You mean to say in all your time
at Gitmo you've never had a meal?

1:25:47.982 --> 1:25:51.145
No, sir.
Three squares a day, sir.

1:25:51.953 --> 1:25:53.545
I don't understand.

1:25:53.621 --> 1:25:56.681
How did you know where the mess hall was
if it’s not in this book?

1:25:59.294 --> 1:26:02.457
Well, I guess I just followed the crowd
at chow time, sir.

1:26:03.431 --> 1:26:05.626
No more questions.

1:26:05.700 --> 1:26:09.363
- Corporal Barnes, you may step down.
- Thank you, sir.

1:26:14.976 --> 1:26:17.467
7:00 tonight we'll do
a final Kendrick review.

1:26:17.545 --> 1:26:20.446
I want to slam-dunk this guy.

1:26:31.893 --> 1:26:33.451
Hey, Luther.

1:26:33.528 --> 1:26:36.019
Admiral, how's
the big case going?

1:26:36.097 --> 1:26:38.065
Nose to the grindstone.

1:26:38.132 --> 1:26:41.295
- No flies on you.
- A rolling stone gathers no moss.

1:26:41.369 --> 1:26:43.894
Well, it ain't over
till the fat lady sings.

1:26:43.972 --> 1:26:46.338
You can say that again.

1:26:46.407 --> 1:26:49.706
- It ain't over till the fat lady sings.
- Till the fat lady sings.

1:26:50.812 --> 1:26:52.746
Walked into that one.

1:27:04.292 --> 1:27:07.022
Oh, Jesus Christ!

1:27:07.095 --> 1:27:09.757
You left the door unlocked.

1:27:09.831 --> 1:27:12.891
- You scared the shit out of me.
-Just keep driving.

1:27:12.967 --> 1:27:14.901
Are you aware
you're under subpoena?

1:27:14.969 --> 1:27:18.769
Yes. I'm also aware that the lives
of two Marines are in your hands.

1:27:18.840 --> 1:27:21.001
If there was something
I could do about that, I would.

1:27:21.075 --> 1:27:23.475
But since I can't,
all I can do is help you.

1:27:23.544 --> 1:27:25.876
- What do you know?
- I know everything.

1:27:25.947 --> 1:27:28.177
- Was it a Code Red?
- Yes.

1:27:28.249 --> 1:27:30.376
- Did Kendrick give the order?
- Yes.

1:27:30.451 --> 1:27:33.386
- Did you witness it?
- I didn't need to.

1:27:33.454 --> 1:27:36.082
Then how do you know?
- I know. - You know shit.

1:27:36.157 --> 1:27:38.523
He was never gonna be transferred
off that base.

1:27:44.465 --> 1:27:47.764
Jessup was gonna keep him on the base.
He said he wanted him trained.

1:27:47.835 --> 1:27:50.429
- The transfer order has your signature.
- Yeah, I know.

1:27:50.505 --> 1:27:54.464
I signed it the morning you arrived
in Cuba, five days after Santiago died.

1:27:58.146 --> 1:28:00.910
I'm gonna get you a deal, some kind
of immunity with the prosecutor.

1:28:00.982 --> 1:28:05.476
In about four days, you'll appear
as a witness and tell what you know.

1:28:05.553 --> 1:28:09.182
I'm gonna check you into a motel.
We are gonna start from the beginning.

1:28:09.257 --> 1:28:13.421
I don't want a deal,
and I don't want immunity.

1:28:13.494 --> 1:28:18.727
I want you to know that I'm proud
neither of what I've done or am doing.

1:28:21.069 --> 1:28:23.037
- Where is he?
- The Downtown Lodge in Northeast.

1:28:23.104 --> 1:28:25.231
- I want him guarded.
- That's a good idea.

1:28:25.306 --> 1:28:28.002
- My clearance code is 411527273.
- Clearance code?

1:28:28.076 --> 1:28:30.738
- Thank you.
- Do you have a clearance code?

1:28:30.812 --> 1:28:32.939
This is Jo Galloway.
I need to secure a witness.

1:28:33.014 --> 1:28:35.983
Anyway, he also said that Jessup’s lying
about the transportation off the base.

1:28:36.050 --> 1:28:38.848
Jessup said that 6:00 the next morning
was the first flight Santiago could have left on.

1:28:38.920 --> 1:28:42.412
Markinson says there was a plane
that left seven hours earlier.

1:28:42.490 --> 1:28:45.516
That was impressive. Did you hear
what I said about the flight?

1:28:45.593 --> 1:28:48.858
Sam, when a flight takes off,
there's a record kept, right?

1:28:48.930 --> 1:28:51.125
Yeah, you need the tower chief’s log
from Gitmo.

1:28:51.199 --> 1:28:54.327
- Get it.
- We're gonna win.

1:28:54.402 --> 1:28:56.768
We don't know who Markinson is.
We don't know what the logbook will say.

1:28:56.838 --> 1:28:59.864
You just concentrate on Downey.
I'm gonna talk to Ross and tell him where we are.

1:29:06.981 --> 1:29:10.417
Nice work today.
Redirect on Barnes.

1:29:10.485 --> 1:29:14.615
- I have Markinson.
- Where is he?

1:29:14.689 --> 1:29:19.023
Motel room in Northeast with
six Federal Marshalls outside his door.

1:29:19.093 --> 1:29:21.254
The transfer that Markinson
signed is phony.

1:29:21.329 --> 1:29:24.162
Jessup's statement that the 6:00 a. m.
flight was the first available is a lie.

1:29:24.232 --> 1:29:26.666
We're checking the tower chief’s log.
I'd like a beer, please.

1:29:26.734 --> 1:29:31.171
In the meantime, I'm gonna put Kendrick
on the stand and have some fun.

1:29:31.239 --> 1:29:34.003
All right, I have
an obligation to tell you...

1:29:34.075 --> 1:29:37.169
that if you accuse Kendrick or Jessup
of any crime without proper evidence...

1:29:37.245 --> 1:29:40.009
you'll be subject to a court-martial
for professional misconduct.

1:29:40.081 --> 1:29:44.575
That's something that'll be stapled to
every job application you ever fill out.

1:29:46.254 --> 1:29:49.815
Markinson's not gonna hold up, Danny.
He's a crazy man.

1:29:49.891 --> 1:29:53.520
I'm not saying this to intimidate you.
I'm being your lawyer here.

1:29:53.594 --> 1:29:57.690
Thanks, Jack. And I think the fucking
bunch of you are certifiably insane.

1:29:57.765 --> 1:30:00.097
Your code of honor makes me
want to beat the shit out of somebody.

1:30:00.168 --> 1:30:04.036
Don't lump me in with them
just because we wear the same uniform.

1:30:04.105 --> 1:30:07.165
I'm your friend, and I don't think
your clients belong in jail...

1:30:07.241 --> 1:30:09.175
but I don't get
to make that decision.

1:30:09.243 --> 1:30:13.646
I represent the United States government
without passion or prejudice.

1:30:13.714 --> 1:30:17.047
- My client has a case.
- Here you go.

1:30:20.888 --> 1:30:23.686
I want you to acknowledge that
the judge advocate has made you aware...

1:30:23.758 --> 1:30:26.625
of the possible consequences involved
in accusing a Marine officer...

1:30:26.694 --> 1:30:28.787
of a felony
without proper evidence.

1:30:28.863 --> 1:30:31.525
I've been so advised.

1:30:35.736 --> 1:30:38.534
You got bullied
into that courtroom, Danny.

1:30:38.606 --> 1:30:42.474
By everyone.
By Dawson, by Galloway.

1:30:42.543 --> 1:30:45.103
Shit, I practically dared you.

1:30:46.280 --> 1:30:49.807
You got bullied into that courtroom
by the memory of a dead lawyer.

1:30:55.923 --> 1:30:59.051
You're a lousy fucking
softball player, Jack!

1:31:02.430 --> 1:31:06.594
Your boys are going down, Danny.
I can't stop it anymore.

1:31:11.906 --> 1:31:15.239
Lieutenant Kendrick, in your opinion,
was Private Santiago a good Marine?

1:31:15.309 --> 1:31:17.402
I'd say he was about average.

1:31:17.478 --> 1:31:20.879
You signed three proficiency
and conduct reports on Santiago.

1:31:20.948 --> 1:31:24.611
On all three reports, you indicate
a rating of below average.

1:31:27.989 --> 1:31:31.925
Yes, Private Santiago
was below average.

1:31:31.993 --> 1:31:35.759
I did not see the need
to trample on a man's grave.

1:31:35.830 --> 1:31:37.991
We appreciate that,
but you’re under oath now.

1:31:38.065 --> 1:31:40.693
Unpleasant as it may be,
we'd all just as soon hear the truth.

1:31:40.768 --> 1:31:42.633
I'm aware of my oath.

1:31:42.703 --> 1:31:47.663
These are the last three pro-con reports
you signed for Lance Corporal Dawson.

1:31:47.742 --> 1:31:49.676
Dawson received
two marks of exceptional...

1:31:49.744 --> 1:31:54.113
but on this most recent report of June 9
he received a rating of below average.

1:31:54.181 --> 1:31:58.174
- I'd like to discuss this last report.
- That would be fine.

1:31:58.252 --> 1:32:01.915
Lance Corporal Dawson's ranking after
the school of infantry was perfect.

1:32:01.989 --> 1:32:04.924
Over half that class has since
been promoted to full corporal...

1:32:04.992 --> 1:32:07.290
while Dawson has remained
a lance corporal.

1:32:07.361 --> 1:32:10.353
Was Dawson's promotion held up
because of this last report?

1:32:10.431 --> 1:32:12.365
I'm sure it was.

1:32:12.433 --> 1:32:15.425
Do you recall why Dawson was given
such a poor grade on this report?

1:32:15.503 --> 1:32:16.800
I'm sure I don't.

1:32:16.871 --> 1:32:20.705
I have many men in my charge.
I write many reports.

1:32:20.775 --> 1:32:26.543
Lieutenant, do you recall an incident
involving a P.F.C. Curtis Bell...

1:32:26.614 --> 1:32:29.344
who'd been found stealing liquor
from the Officers' Club?

1:32:29.417 --> 1:32:31.317
Yes, I do.

1:32:31.385 --> 1:32:33.819
Did you report Private Bell
to proper authorities?

1:32:35.723 --> 1:32:37.884
I have two books at my bedside-

1:32:37.959 --> 1:32:40.951
The Marine Corps Code of Conduct
and The King James Bible.

1:32:41.028 --> 1:32:43.622
The only proper authorities I'm aware of
are my commanding officer...

1:32:43.698 --> 1:32:46.360
Colonel Nathan R. Jessup
and the Lord our God.

1:32:47.969 --> 1:32:50.529
At your request, Lieutenant Kendrick,
I can have the record reflect...

1:32:50.605 --> 1:32:53.267
your lack of acknowledgement
of this court as a proper authority.

1:32:53.341 --> 1:32:56.174
- Objection. Argumentative.
- Sustained.

1:32:56.243 --> 1:32:58.336
Watch yourself, counselor.

1:32:58.412 --> 1:33:01.108
Did you report Private Bell
to your superiors?

1:33:01.182 --> 1:33:03.946
I remember thinking very highly
of Private Bell-

1:33:04.018 --> 1:33:07.181
not wanting to see his record tarnished
by a formal charge.

1:33:08.356 --> 1:33:11.223
You preferred it be handled
within the unit?

1:33:12.960 --> 1:33:14.894
Yes, I most certainly did.

1:33:16.130 --> 1:33:19.361
- Do you know what a Code Red is?
- Yes, I do.

1:33:19.433 --> 1:33:22.630
- Have you ever ordered a Code Red?
- No, I have not.

1:33:22.703 --> 1:33:25.797
Did you order Dawson and two other men
to make sure that Private Bell...

1:33:25.873 --> 1:33:31.311
received no food or drink, except water,
for a period of seven days?

1:33:31.379 --> 1:33:33.677
That is a distortion
of the truth, Lieutenant.

1:33:33.748 --> 1:33:36.012
Private Bell was placed
on barracks restriction.

1:33:36.083 --> 1:33:39.177
He was given water and vitamin
supplements, and I can assure you...

1:33:39.253 --> 1:33:43.212
at no time
was his health in danger.

1:33:43.290 --> 1:33:46.020
I'm sure it was lovely
for Private Bell.

1:33:46.093 --> 1:33:48.755
But you did order
the barracks restriction, didn’t you?

1:33:48.829 --> 1:33:52.993
- You did order the denial of food?
- Yes, I did.

1:33:53.067 --> 1:33:56.867
Wouldn't this form of discipline
be considered a Code Red?

1:33:57.868 --> 1:33:58.868
No.

1:33:59.674 --> 1:34:03.542
If I called the other 478 Marines
at Guantanamo Bay to testify...

1:34:03.611 --> 1:34:05.704
would they consider it
a Code Red?

1:34:05.780 --> 1:34:09.739
The witness can't possibly testify
as to what 478 other men would say.

1:34:09.817 --> 1:34:13.685
We object to this entire line
of questioning. It's argumentative...

1:34:13.754 --> 1:34:16.120
and irrelevant badgering
of the witness.

1:34:16.190 --> 1:34:18.818
The government's objection
is sustained, Lieutenant Kaffee...

1:34:18.893 --> 1:34:22.021
and I would remind you that you’re now
questioning a Marine officer...

1:34:22.096 --> 1:34:24.223
with an impeccable service record.

1:34:24.298 --> 1:34:25.856
Thank you, Your Honor.

1:34:26.934 --> 1:34:30.734
Lieutenant, was Dawson given a rating
of below average on this last report...

1:34:30.805 --> 1:34:33.672
because you learned he'd been sneaking
food to Private Bell?

1:34:33.741 --> 1:34:37.006
- Object!
- Not so fast. Lieutenant?

1:34:38.679 --> 1:34:42.342
Lance Corporal Dawson
was given a below average rating...

1:34:43.317 --> 1:34:45.785
because he had committed a crime.

1:34:45.853 --> 1:34:49.118
A crime?
What crime did he commit?

1:34:53.027 --> 1:34:58.795
Dawson brought a hungry guy some food.
What crime did he commit?

1:35:00.801 --> 1:35:02.359
He disobeyed an order.

1:35:02.436 --> 1:35:04.927
And because he exercised
his own set of values...

1:35:05.005 --> 1:35:07.997
because he made a decision
about the welfare of a Marine...

1:35:08.075 --> 1:35:11.704
that was in conflict with your order,
he was punished, is that right?

1:35:11.779 --> 1:35:15.306
Lance Corporal Dawson
disobeyed an order.

1:35:15.382 --> 1:35:17.907
Yeah, but it wasn't
a real order, was it?

1:35:17.985 --> 1:35:20.180
After all, it's peacetime.

1:35:20.254 --> 1:35:23.519
He wasn't being asked to secure a hill
or advance on a beachhead.

1:35:23.591 --> 1:35:28.028
I mean, surely a Marine
of Dawson's intelligence...

1:35:28.095 --> 1:35:31.189
can be trusted to determine on his own
which are the important orders...

1:35:31.265 --> 1:35:35.167
and which orders might, say,
be morally questionable?

1:35:38.405 --> 1:35:40.202
Can he?

1:35:40.274 --> 1:35:43.937
Can Dawson determine on his own
which orders he's going to follow?

1:35:44.011 --> 1:35:45.706
No, he cannot.

1:35:45.780 --> 1:35:48.510
A lesson he learned
after the Curtis Bell incident, right?

1:35:48.582 --> 1:35:51.449
- I would think so.
- You know so, don’t you?

1:35:51.519 --> 1:35:53.214
- Object!
- Sustained.

1:35:55.256 --> 1:35:58.191
Lieutenant Kendrick,
one final question.

1:35:59.493 --> 1:36:02.792
If you had ordered Dawson
to give Santiago a Code Red-

1:36:02.863 --> 1:36:07.095
- I specifically ordered those men-
- Would he disobey you again?

1:36:07.168 --> 1:36:11.229
- Lieutenant, don't answer that!
- You don't have to. I'm through.

1:36:11.305 --> 1:36:14.934
Lieutenant Kendrick, did you order
Lance Corporal Dawson...

1:36:15.009 --> 1:36:18.968
and Private Downey
to give Willie Santiago a Code Red?

1:36:22.183 --> 1:36:25.152
- No, I did not.
- Thank you.

1:36:29.123 --> 1:36:31.284
What's the word?

1:36:31.358 --> 1:36:35.624
I got the tower chief’s log from that
night. Jessup’s telling the truth.

1:36:35.696 --> 1:36:39.928
- 6:00 a. m. flight was the first plane.
- Let me see this.

1:36:50.110 --> 1:36:52.977
- Working late tonight?
- Oh, yeah.

1:36:57.351 --> 1:37:01.048
There wasn't a flight at 11:00.
What the fuck are you trying to pull?

1:37:01.121 --> 1:37:04.352
The first flight stateside
left Guantanamo Bay at 2300.

1:37:04.425 --> 1:37:08.361
It arrived at Andrews Air Force Base
at a few minutes past 2:00.

1:37:08.429 --> 1:37:11.626
Really? Then why isn't it
listed in the tower chief’s log?

1:37:13.734 --> 1:37:15.031
Jessup.

1:37:15.102 --> 1:37:17.536
What are you telling me?
He fixed the logbook?

1:37:19.573 --> 1:37:23.600
Maybe he can make it so a plane didn't
take off, but I can prove one landed.

1:37:23.677 --> 1:37:25.770
I'll get the logbook from Andrews.

1:37:25.846 --> 1:37:28.815
You're not gonna find anything
in the Andrews logbook, either.

1:37:28.883 --> 1:37:30.817
He can make
an entire flight disappear?

1:37:30.885 --> 1:37:35.379
Jessup is about to be appointed director
of operations for the Security Council.

1:37:35.456 --> 1:37:39.449
You don't get to that position without
knowing how to sidestep some land mines.

1:37:39.526 --> 1:37:42.393
He's not gonna be able
to sidestep you.

1:37:42.463 --> 1:37:44.863
You don't still intend
to put me on the stand?

1:37:44.932 --> 1:37:47.867
Thursday morning, 10:00.

1:37:52.306 --> 1:37:56.140
There's gotta be someone
who can testify to the flight.

1:37:56.210 --> 1:37:59.441
This isn't TWA.
There isn't a regular flight schedule.

1:37:59.513 --> 1:38:02.311
Do you have any idea how many planes
take off and land every day?

1:38:02.383 --> 1:38:05.819
A ground crew kid won't remember
a flight that landed four weeks ago.

1:38:05.886 --> 1:38:09.049
- How do you know if you don't check?
- Forget the flight!

1:38:09.123 --> 1:38:12.923
Markinson will testify that Jessup
refused to transfer Santiago.

1:38:12.993 --> 1:38:15.553
He'll testify to the forged transfer,
and that'll be enough.

1:38:15.629 --> 1:38:18.154
That and Downey's testimony
really ought to be enough.

1:38:23.671 --> 1:38:27.630
Why did you go into Santiago's room
on the night of the 6th?

1:38:27.708 --> 1:38:30.939
To give Private Santiago
a Code Red, ma'am.

1:38:31.011 --> 1:38:33.206
Why did you give him a Code Red?

1:38:33.280 --> 1:38:36.716
I was ordered to give him a Code Red
by the platoon commander...

1:38:36.784 --> 1:38:41.016
of Rifle Security Company Windward,
Lieutenant Jonathan James Kendrick.

1:38:42.222 --> 1:38:44.622
You're gonna do fine.

1:38:46.226 --> 1:38:48.717
You think they'll let us go back
to our platoon soon, ma'am?

1:38:50.164 --> 1:38:52.064
Absolutely.

1:38:55.269 --> 1:38:57.703
Do you remember the order of questions?
Are you sure?

1:38:57.771 --> 1:39:00.706
And we'll use small words, 'cause he
gets rattled if he doesn't understand.

1:39:00.774 --> 1:39:03.675
- I'm just saying go slow.
- I'm gonna go slow.

1:39:03.744 --> 1:39:06.679
And get him off
as fast as you can.

1:39:06.747 --> 1:39:09.682
What?
It's gonna be fine.

1:39:12.119 --> 1:39:14.087
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Santiago...

1:39:15.422 --> 1:39:17.890
I was William's executive officer.

1:39:17.958 --> 1:39:21.450
I knew your son vaguely,
which is to say I knew his name.

1:39:22.529 --> 1:39:24.520
In a matter of time,
the trial of the two men...

1:39:24.598 --> 1:39:27.294
charged with your son's death
will be concluded...

1:39:27.368 --> 1:39:29.632
and seven men and two women
whom you've never met...

1:39:29.703 --> 1:39:33.696
will try to offer you an explanation
as to why William is dead.

1:39:33.774 --> 1:39:37.403
For my part, I've done as much as I can
to bring the truth to light.

1:39:38.278 --> 1:39:39.802
And the truth is this-

1:39:39.880 --> 1:39:42.440
Your son is dead for only one reason-

1:39:42.516 --> 1:39:45.451
I wasn't strong enough to stop it.

1:39:45.519 --> 1:39:49.922
Always, Lieutenant Colonel
Matthew Andrew Markinson...

1:39:49.990 --> 1:39:51.480
United States Marine Corps.

1:39:56.630 --> 1:40:00.157
Private, I want you
to tell us one last time.

1:40:00.234 --> 1:40:06.070
Why did you go to Private Santiago's
room on the night of September 6?

1:40:06.140 --> 1:40:08.540
A Code Red was ordered
by my platoon commander...

1:40:08.609 --> 1:40:10.941
Lieutenant Jonathan James Kendrick.

1:40:11.512 --> 1:40:13.275
Thank you.

1:40:13.347 --> 1:40:14.939
Your witness.

1:40:19.486 --> 1:40:21.681
Private, the week of 2 September...

1:40:21.755 --> 1:40:25.247
the switch log has you down
at Post 39 until 1600.

1:40:25.325 --> 1:40:26.519
Is that correct?

1:40:26.593 --> 1:40:29.528
I'm sure it is, sir.
They keep that log pretty good.

1:40:29.596 --> 1:40:33.191
How far is it from Post 39
to the Windward Barracks?

1:40:33.267 --> 1:40:36.725
Well, it's a ways, sir.
It's a hike.

1:40:36.804 --> 1:40:39.637
About how far by Jeep?

1:40:39.706 --> 1:40:43.073
About ten or fifteen minutes, sir.

1:40:43.143 --> 1:40:45.043
You ever had to walk it?

1:40:45.112 --> 1:40:48.946
Yes, sir. That day, Friday.
The pickup private-

1:40:49.016 --> 1:40:52.076
That's what we call the guy
who drops us off and picks us up...

1:40:52.152 --> 1:40:55.349
also 'cause he can get girls
in New York City.

1:40:56.390 --> 1:40:58.551
The pickup private got a flat,
sir, right at 39.

1:40:58.625 --> 1:41:01.458
He pulled up and, bam,
blowout with no spare.

1:41:01.528 --> 1:41:03.587
So we had to double-time it
back to the barracks.

1:41:03.664 --> 1:41:07.361
And if it’s about ten or fifteen
minutes by Jeep, I'm guessing...

1:41:07.434 --> 1:41:10.494
it must be a good hour by foot,
am I right?

1:41:10.571 --> 1:41:13.665
Pickup and me did it
in 45 flat, sir.

1:41:13.740 --> 1:41:15.173
Not bad.

1:41:16.610 --> 1:41:20.046
You've said that your assault
on Private Santiago...

1:41:20.114 --> 1:41:23.379
was a result of an order
that Lieutenant Kendrick gave you...

1:41:23.450 --> 1:41:27.011
in your barracks room
at 1620, am I right?

1:41:28.155 --> 1:41:29.747
Yes, sir.

1:41:29.823 --> 1:41:33.623
But you just said that you didn't
make it back to the barracks until 1645.

1:41:34.964 --> 1:41:35.824
Sir?

1:41:36.196 --> 1:41:40.326
Well, if you didn't make it back
to the barracks until 1645...

1:41:40.400 --> 1:41:42.595
how could you be
in your room at 1620?

1:41:43.637 --> 1:41:46.435
Well, you see, sir,
there was a blowout-

1:41:46.507 --> 1:41:50.409
Did you ever actually hear
Lieutenant Kendrick order a Code Red?

1:41:50.477 --> 1:41:52.206
Well, Hal said that-

1:41:52.279 --> 1:41:54.804
Private, did you ever
actually hear...

1:41:54.882 --> 1:41:57.612
Lieutenant Kendrick
order a Code Red?

1:41:57.913 --> 1:41:59.313
No, sir.

1:41:59.386 --> 1:42:02.719
I'd like to request a recess
in order to confer with my client.

1:42:02.789 --> 1:42:05.121
- Why did you go into Santiago's room?
- The witness has rights!

1:42:05.192 --> 1:42:08.457
- The witness has been read his rights.
- The question will be repeated.

1:42:08.529 --> 1:42:10.463
Why did you go
into Santiago's room?

1:42:10.531 --> 1:42:13.967
Did Lance Corporal Dawson tell you
to give Santiago a Code Red?

1:42:14.034 --> 1:42:15.797
- Don't look at him!
- Hal!

1:42:15.869 --> 1:42:17.803
Answer the captain's question!

1:42:21.108 --> 1:42:23.440
Yes, Captain, I was given an order
by my squad leader...

1:42:23.510 --> 1:42:26.843
Lance Corporal Harold W. Dawson,
United States Marine Corps...

1:42:26.914 --> 1:42:28.176
and I followed it.

1:42:49.603 --> 1:42:51.264
Where do you think he is?

1:42:53.540 --> 1:42:56.304
As far as Downey was concerned,
it was an order from Kendrick.

1:42:56.376 --> 1:42:58.344
It doesn't matter that
he didn't hear it firsthand.

1:42:58.412 --> 1:43:01.472
He doesn't distinguish
between the two.

1:43:05.652 --> 1:43:07.950
Danny, I'm sorry.

1:43:08.855 --> 1:43:10.413
Don't worry about it.

1:43:10.490 --> 1:43:13.050
Sam and I were just talking about
how all we really have to do...

1:43:13.126 --> 1:43:15.993
is call some witnesses
who will talk about implied orders.

1:43:16.063 --> 1:43:18.623
Maybe we can put Downey back
on the stand before we get to Dawson.

1:43:19.399 --> 1:43:24.029
If we work at it, we can get Dawson
charged with the Kennedy assassination.

1:43:27.341 --> 1:43:28.501
Are you drunk?

1:43:29.376 --> 1:43:32.140
Pretty much.

1:43:32.212 --> 1:43:34.544
Yeah.

1:43:34.615 --> 1:43:38.176
I'll put on a pot of coffee.
We've got a long night's work ahead.

1:43:39.319 --> 1:43:41.719
She's gonna make coffee.

1:43:42.856 --> 1:43:44.824
That's nice.

1:43:48.762 --> 1:43:51.595
Downey wasn’t in his room.

1:43:51.665 --> 1:43:53.565
Wasn't even there.

1:43:55.002 --> 1:43:58.199
That was an important piece
of information, don’t you think?

1:44:00.674 --> 1:44:04.974
Danny, it was a setback,
and I'm sorry.

1:44:05.045 --> 1:44:07.741
But we fix it,
and move on to Markinson.

1:44:09.483 --> 1:44:11.212
Markinson's dead.

1:44:17.090 --> 1:44:21.117
You really gotta hand it
to those Federal Marshals, boy.

1:44:21.194 --> 1:44:23.856
It's not like he hanged himself
by his shoelaces...

1:44:23.930 --> 1:44:26.558
or slashed his wrists
with a concealed butter knife.

1:44:26.633 --> 1:44:28.066
This guy...

1:44:30.003 --> 1:44:33.666
got into full dress uniform,
stood in the middle of that room...

1:44:33.740 --> 1:44:36.903
drew a nickel-plated pistol
from his holster...

1:44:36.977 --> 1:44:39.377
and fired a bullet into his mouth.

1:44:43.283 --> 1:44:47.151
Anyway, since we seem to be out of
witnesses, I thought I'd drink a little.

1:44:47.220 --> 1:44:49.415
I still think we can win.

1:44:51.458 --> 1:44:53.085
Maybe you should drink a little.

1:44:53.160 --> 1:44:58.154
We'll go to Randolph in the morning and
make a motion for a 24-hour continuance.

1:44:58.231 --> 1:45:01.496
- Why would we want to do that?
- To subpoena Colonel Jessup.

1:45:02.669 --> 1:45:05.433
- What?
- Listen for a second. Hear me out.

1:45:05.434 --> 1:45:07.530
No. I won't listen,
and I won't hear you out.

1:45:07.607 --> 1:45:09.905
Your passion is compelling, Jo.
It's also useless.

1:45:09.976 --> 1:45:13.104
Louden Downey
needed a trial lawyer today.

1:45:16.116 --> 1:45:17.811
You're chickenshit.

1:45:17.884 --> 1:45:20.614
You're gonna use what happened today
as an excuse to give up.

1:45:22.089 --> 1:45:23.681
It's over.

1:45:23.757 --> 1:45:26.317
Why did you ask Jessup
for the transfer order?

1:45:26.393 --> 1:45:29.021
- In Cuba. Why?
- What does it matter?

1:45:29.096 --> 1:45:31.758
- I wanted the damn transfer order!
- Bullshit.

1:45:31.832 --> 1:45:35.324
You could've gotten it by calling
any department at the Pentagon.

1:45:35.402 --> 1:45:40.135
You didn't want the transfer order.
You wanted to see Jessup’s reaction.

1:45:40.207 --> 1:45:43.267
You had an instinct,
and it was confirmed by Markinson.

1:45:43.343 --> 1:45:46.278
Let's put Jessup on the stand
and end this thing!

1:45:46.346 --> 1:45:50.510
What possible good could come
from putting Jessup on the stand?

1:45:50.584 --> 1:45:52.711
He told Kendrick
to order the Code Red.

1:45:52.786 --> 1:45:56.847
He did? That's great!
Why didn’t you say so?

1:45:56.923 --> 1:45:59.187
And of course
you have proof of that!

1:45:59.259 --> 1:46:03.491
Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot. You were sick
the day they taught law at law school.

1:46:03.563 --> 1:46:06.031
You put him on the stand,
and you get it from him.

1:46:06.099 --> 1:46:10.126
Oh, we get it from him!
Yes! No problem!

1:46:10.203 --> 1:46:14.037
Colonel Jessup, isn't it true that
you ordered the Code Red on Santiago?

1:46:14.107 --> 1:46:17.235
- Listen, we're all a little-
- I'm sorry. Your time's run out.

1:46:17.310 --> 1:46:20.404
What do we have for the losers?
Well, for our defendants...

1:46:20.480 --> 1:46:22.846
it's a lifetime
at exotic Fort Leavenworth.

1:46:22.916 --> 1:46:25.885
And for Defense Counsel Kaffee...

1:46:25.952 --> 1:46:27.749
it's a court-martial!

1:46:27.821 --> 1:46:30.984
Yes, Johnny,
after falsely accusing...

1:46:31.057 --> 1:46:33.389
a highly decorated Marine officer...

1:46:33.460 --> 1:46:35.325
of conspiracy and perjury...

1:46:35.395 --> 1:46:38.523
Lieutenant Kaffee will have
a long and prosperous career...

1:46:38.598 --> 1:46:43.831
teaching typewriter maintenance
at the Rocco Clubo School for Women.

1:46:43.904 --> 1:46:46.964
Thank you for playing
"Should we or should we not...

1:46:47.040 --> 1:46:50.100
follow the advice
of the galactically stupid?"

1:47:11.965 --> 1:47:15.025
I'm sorry I lost
your set of steak knives.

1:47:32.018 --> 1:47:33.952
Stop cleaning up.

1:47:39.159 --> 1:47:41.093
Stop cleaning up.

1:47:49.603 --> 1:47:52.538
- Want a drink?
- Yeah.

1:48:10.557 --> 1:48:13.788
- Is your father proud of you?
- Don't do this to yourself.

1:48:13.860 --> 1:48:15.589
I'll bet he is.

1:48:16.396 --> 1:48:19.729
I'll bet he bores the shit
out of the neighbors and relatives.

1:48:19.799 --> 1:48:24.259
"Sam's made Law Review.
He's got a big case he's making.

1:48:24.337 --> 1:48:27.465
He's arguing.
He's making an argument. "

1:48:32.979 --> 1:48:37.211
I think my father would’ve enjoyed
seeing me graduate from law school.

1:48:40.720 --> 1:48:43.416
I think he would've liked that
an awful lot.

1:48:45.992 --> 1:48:48.961
Did I ever tell you I wrote a paper
about your father in college?

1:48:50.030 --> 1:48:51.463
Yeah?

1:48:51.531 --> 1:48:54.125
One of the best
trial lawyers ever.

1:48:54.200 --> 1:48:57.533
Yes, he was.

1:48:57.604 --> 1:48:59.902
If I were Dawson and Downey
and I had a choice...

1:48:59.973 --> 1:49:02.942
between you or your father
to represent me in this case...

1:49:03.009 --> 1:49:06.001
I'd choose you any day of the week
and twice on Sunday.

1:49:06.079 --> 1:49:09.480
You should've seen yourself
thunder away at Kendrick.

1:49:12.586 --> 1:49:14.520
Would you put Jessup on the stand?

1:49:18.258 --> 1:49:22.718
- Do you think my father would have?
- With the evidence we got?

1:49:22.796 --> 1:49:25.697
Not in a million years.

1:49:25.765 --> 1:49:29.132
But here's the thing- and there's
really know way of getting around this-

1:49:29.202 --> 1:49:33.536
Neither Lyle Kaffee nor Sam Weinberg
are lead counsel for the defense...

1:49:33.607 --> 1:49:36.735
in the matter of
U.S. v. Dawson and Downey.

1:49:36.810 --> 1:49:40.746
So there's really only one question-
What would you do?

1:49:52.792 --> 1:49:56.853
Jo, get in the car.
Joanne, please get in the car.

1:49:56.930 --> 1:49:58.363
Look-

1:50:01.835 --> 1:50:06.169
I apologize. I was angry.
I'm sorry about what I said.

1:50:06.239 --> 1:50:08.833
I'm gonna put Jessup on the stand.

1:50:29.095 --> 1:50:30.756
What do you suggest we do?

1:50:30.830 --> 1:50:33.025
I say we hit Jessup
with the phony transfer order.

1:50:33.099 --> 1:50:35.033
What's a transfer order
without a witness?

1:50:35.101 --> 1:50:36.693
- We have a witness.
- A dead witness.

1:50:36.770 --> 1:50:39.671
In the hands of a lesser attorney,
that would be a problem.

1:50:39.739 --> 1:50:42.207
Look at this. Last night
he's swimming in Jack Daniels...

1:50:42.275 --> 1:50:45.005
and now he can leap tall buildings
in a single bound.

1:50:45.078 --> 1:50:48.275
I'm getting my second wind.
Sit down, both of you.

1:50:48.348 --> 1:50:52.876
Good. Jessup told Kendrick
to order the Code Red. Kendrick did.

1:50:52.952 --> 1:50:55.182
Our clients followed the order.
The cover-up isn't our case.

1:50:55.255 --> 1:50:59.885
To win, Jessup needs to tell the court
members that he ordered the Code Red.

1:50:59.959 --> 1:51:03.690
- You think you can get him to say it?
- I think he wants to say it.

1:51:03.763 --> 1:51:06.027
I think he's pissed off
that he's got to hide from us.

1:51:06.099 --> 1:51:09.591
I think he wants to say that he made
a command decision, and that's the end.

1:51:09.669 --> 1:51:12.604
He eats breakfast 300 yards away...

1:51:12.672 --> 1:51:15.971
from 4,000 Cubans
that are trained to kill him.

1:51:16.042 --> 1:51:18.101
No one's gonna tell him
how to run his unit.

1:51:18.178 --> 1:51:21.045
Least of all the Harvard mouth
in his faggoty white uniform.

1:51:21.114 --> 1:51:23.241
I need to shake him,
put him on the defensive...

1:51:23.316 --> 1:51:26.012
and lead him right
where he's dying to go.

1:51:26.086 --> 1:51:29.055
- That's it? That's the plan?
- That's the plan.

1:51:29.122 --> 1:51:32.319
- How are you gonna do it?
- I have no idea.

1:51:32.392 --> 1:51:34.519
- I need my bat.
- Your what?

1:51:34.594 --> 1:51:36.858
I think better with my bat.
Where's my bat?

1:51:36.930 --> 1:51:40.388
- I put it in the closet.
- You put it in the closet?

1:51:40.467 --> 1:51:44.369
- I was tripping on it.
- Don't ever put that bat in the closet.

1:51:44.437 --> 1:51:48.237
- He thinks better with his bat?
- I can understand that.

1:51:59.686 --> 1:52:02.587
Stay here.
I'm going to the office for a while.

1:52:05.125 --> 1:52:07.753
He does think better with that bat.

1:52:30.250 --> 1:52:33.583
Sam, I need you
to do something for me.

1:52:36.790 --> 1:52:40.021
- What's going on?
- Gotta go out to Andrews.

1:53:03.883 --> 1:53:05.817
- Where's Sam?
- He's on his way.

1:53:05.885 --> 1:53:07.819
- Did he get the guys?
- Yeah.

1:53:07.887 --> 1:53:10.879
Listen, can I talk to you
for a second?

1:53:10.957 --> 1:53:13.187
Oh, yeah, sure.

1:53:23.636 --> 1:53:25.297
How you feeling?

1:53:26.706 --> 1:53:30.267
Well, I think Jessup’s
gonna have his hands full today.

1:53:33.012 --> 1:53:34.946
Listen, Danny...

1:53:36.115 --> 1:53:38.549
when you're out there today...

1:53:38.618 --> 1:53:41.781
if you feel like
it's not gonna happen...

1:53:41.855 --> 1:53:44.983
if you feel like
he's not gonna say it...

1:53:45.058 --> 1:53:46.650
don't go for it.

1:53:48.161 --> 1:53:50.391
You could get in trouble.

1:53:50.463 --> 1:53:52.556
I'm special counsel
for Internal Affairs...

1:53:52.632 --> 1:53:55.192
and I'm telling you
you could get in a lot of trouble.

1:53:55.268 --> 1:53:57.259
Wait, Lieutenant Commander Galloway...

1:53:57.337 --> 1:54:01.569
you're not suggesting
that I back off a material witness?

1:54:01.641 --> 1:54:04.838
If you think you can't get him, yeah.

1:54:07.080 --> 1:54:08.741
All rise.

1:54:13.586 --> 1:54:16.578
- Where's Sam?
- He's on his way.

1:54:22.195 --> 1:54:24.789
- Call your first witness.
- Where is he?

1:54:24.864 --> 1:54:27.196
- He'll be here.
- Lieutenant.

1:54:27.267 --> 1:54:28.928
Call your witness.

1:54:35.608 --> 1:54:38.270
Defense calls Colonel Nathan Jessup.

1:54:55.061 --> 1:54:57.894
Colonel Jessup, would you raise
your right hand please, sir?

1:54:57.964 --> 1:55:01.422
Do you solemnly swear that the testimony
you will give in this court-martial...

1:55:01.501 --> 1:55:04.937
will be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

1:55:05.004 --> 1:55:06.403
Yes, I do.

1:55:06.472 --> 1:55:07.939
Have a seat please, sir.

1:55:09.575 --> 1:55:13.033
Would you state your name, rank
and current billet for the record, sir?

1:55:13.112 --> 1:55:16.240
Colonel Nathan R. Jessup,
commanding officer...

1:55:16.316 --> 1:55:19.615
Marine Ground Forces,
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

1:55:19.686 --> 1:55:22.018
- Thank you, sir.
- He's not here.

1:55:27.827 --> 1:55:31.388
Colonel, when you learned
of Santiago’s letter to the N.I.S...

1:55:31.464 --> 1:55:34.592
you had a meeting
with your two senior officers.

1:55:34.667 --> 1:55:36.726
- Is that right?
- Yes.

1:55:36.803 --> 1:55:40.398
The platoon commander,
Lieutenant Jonathan Kendrick...

1:55:40.473 --> 1:55:44.136
and the executive officer,
Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Markinson.

1:55:44.210 --> 1:55:45.734
Yes.

1:55:45.812 --> 1:55:50.306
And at present Colonel Markinson
is dead. Is that right?

1:55:50.383 --> 1:55:54.444
Objection. I'd like to know just what
the defense counsel is implying.

1:55:54.520 --> 1:55:57.956
I'm implying simply that at present
Colonel Markinson is not alive.

1:55:58.024 --> 1:56:01.755
Colonel Jessup doesn't need to appear
in court to confirm that information.

1:56:01.828 --> 1:56:04.262
I just wasn't sure the witness was aware
that two days ago...

1:56:04.330 --> 1:56:07.128
the colonel took his own life
with a .45-caliber pistol.

1:56:07.200 --> 1:56:09.668
The witness is aware,
the court is aware...

1:56:09.736 --> 1:56:11.670
and now the court members
are aware.

1:56:11.738 --> 1:56:15.299
We thank you for bringing this
to our attention.

1:56:15.375 --> 1:56:17.104
Move on, Lieutenant..

1:56:17.176 --> 1:56:18.939
Yes, sir.

1:56:19.012 --> 1:56:22.641
Colonel, you gave Lieutenant Kendrick
an order at this meeting, right?

1:56:22.715 --> 1:56:27.049
I told Kendrick to tell his men
that Santiago wasn't to be touched.

1:56:27.120 --> 1:56:30.055
And did you give an order
to Colonel Markinson as well?

1:56:30.123 --> 1:56:35.652
I ordered Markinson to have Santiago
transferred off the base immediately.

1:56:35.728 --> 1:56:37.525
Why?

1:56:37.597 --> 1:56:41.363
I felt his life might be in danger
once word of the letter got out.

1:56:41.434 --> 1:56:42.867
Grave danger?

1:56:42.935 --> 1:56:45.130
Is there another kind?

1:56:48.741 --> 1:56:52.677
Colonel, we have the transfer order
that you and Markinson co-signed...

1:56:52.745 --> 1:56:57.375
ordering that Santiago be on a flight
leaving Guantanamo at 6:00 the next morning.

1:56:57.450 --> 1:57:02.547
- Was that the first flight?
- The 0600 was the first flight.

1:57:06.426 --> 1:57:09.793
You flew up to Washington this morning.
Is that right?

1:57:09.862 --> 1:57:13.263
I notice you’re wearing your
class "A" dress uniform in court today.

1:57:13.332 --> 1:57:16.529
- As are you, Lieutenant.
- Did you wear that on the plane?

1:57:16.602 --> 1:57:19.400
Please the court, is this dialogue
relevant to anything-

1:57:19.472 --> 1:57:22.168
Defense didn't have the opportunity
to depose this witness.

1:57:22.241 --> 1:57:25.938
- I'd ask for a little latitude.
- A very little latitude.

1:57:28.181 --> 1:57:30.206
I wore utilities on the plane.

1:57:30.283 --> 1:57:33.343
- You brought your dress uniform?
- Yes.

1:57:33.419 --> 1:57:36.820
- Toothbrush, shaving kit, underwear?
- Your Honor!

1:57:36.889 --> 1:57:39.255
Is the colonel's underwear
a matter of national security?

1:57:39.325 --> 1:57:42.726
Gentlemen! You better get somewhere
fast with this, Lieutenant.

1:57:42.795 --> 1:57:44.854
Yes, sir. Colonel?

1:57:45.965 --> 1:57:49.696
I brought a change of clothes
and some personal items.

1:57:49.769 --> 1:57:51.634
Thank you.

1:57:51.704 --> 1:57:55.367
After Dawson and Downey's arrest
on the night of the sixth...

1:57:55.441 --> 1:57:59.707
Santiago's barracks were sealed off
and its contents inventoried.

1:57:59.779 --> 1:58:03.078
" Four pairs camouflage pants,
three long-sleeve khaki shirts...

1:58:03.149 --> 1:58:07.051
three pairs of boots, four pairs
green socks, three green T-shirts-"

1:58:07.120 --> 1:58:10.055
Please the court, is there a question
anywhere in our future?

1:58:10.123 --> 1:58:13.251
Lieutenant Kaffee, I have to ask you
to state your question.

1:58:13.326 --> 1:58:16.124
I'm wondering why Santiago
wasn't packed.

1:58:18.197 --> 1:58:21.462
I'll tell you what.
We'll get back to that one in a minute.

1:58:22.368 --> 1:58:25.701
This is a record of all phone calls made
from your base in the past 24 hours.

1:58:25.771 --> 1:58:29.366
After being subpoenaed to Washington,
you made three calls.

1:58:29.442 --> 1:58:31.774
Do you recognize
those number, sir?

1:58:31.844 --> 1:58:34.972
I called Colonel Fitzhughes
in Quantico, Virginia.

1:58:35.047 --> 1:58:37.845
I wanted to let him know
that I would be in town.

1:58:37.917 --> 1:58:41.478
The second call was to arrange a meeting
with Congressman Richmond...

1:58:41.554 --> 1:58:43.818
of the House Armed Services Committee.

1:58:43.890 --> 1:58:46.950
And the third call
was to my sister Elizabeth.

1:58:47.026 --> 1:58:49.119
Why did you make that call, sir?

1:58:49.195 --> 1:58:52.596
I thought she might like
to have dinner tonight.

1:58:52.665 --> 1:58:56.032
- I'm gonna stop this.
- These are phone records from Gitmo...

1:58:56.102 --> 1:59:00.334
for September 6,
and these are 14 letters...

1:59:00.406 --> 1:59:03.136
that Santiago wrote in nine months...

1:59:03.209 --> 1:59:06.372
requesting- in fact, begging-
for a transfer.

1:59:06.445 --> 1:59:09.642
Upon hearing the news that
he was finally getting his transfer...

1:59:09.715 --> 1:59:13.674
Santiago was so excited that
do you know how many people he called?

1:59:13.753 --> 1:59:16.221
Zero. Nobody.

1:59:16.289 --> 1:59:20.157
Not one call to his parents
saying he was coming home.

1:59:20.226 --> 1:59:23.457
Not one call to a friend, saying,
"Can you pick me up at the airport?"

1:59:23.529 --> 1:59:27.363
He was asleep in his bed at midnight,
and according to you...

1:59:27.433 --> 1:59:29.958
he was getting on a plane
in six hours.

1:59:30.036 --> 1:59:33.597
Yet everything he owned
was hanging neatly in his closet...

1:59:33.673 --> 1:59:36.301
and folded neatly in his footlocker.

1:59:36.375 --> 1:59:40.141
You were leaving for one day.
You packed a bag and made three calls.

1:59:40.213 --> 1:59:44.547
Santiago was leaving
for the rest of his life...

1:59:46.319 --> 1:59:49.083
and he hadn't called a soul...

1:59:49.155 --> 1:59:51.817
and he hadn't packed a thing.

1:59:55.061 --> 1:59:56.824
Can you explain that?

1:59:59.332 --> 2:00:01.596
The fact is,
there was no transfer order.

2:00:01.667 --> 2:00:04.431
Santiago wasn't going anywhere.
Isn't that right, Colonel?

2:00:04.503 --> 2:00:07.961
Objection. Your Honor, it's obvious
that Lieutenant Kaffee's intention...

2:00:08.040 --> 2:00:10.372
is the smear
a high-ranking Marine officer...

2:00:10.443 --> 2:00:14.106
in the hope that the mere appearance
of impropriety will win him points.

2:00:14.180 --> 2:00:18.116
It's my recommendation, sir,
that Lieutenant Kaffee be reprimanded...

2:00:18.184 --> 2:00:21.085
and the witness be excused
with the court's deepest apologies.

2:00:22.922 --> 2:00:26.016
Overruled.
Your objection is noted.

2:00:32.465 --> 2:00:34.296
Is this funny, sir?

2:00:34.367 --> 2:00:37.700
No, it's not.
It's tragic.

2:00:37.770 --> 2:00:40.466
- Do you have an answer?
- Absolutely.

2:00:40.539 --> 2:00:44.339
My answer is,
I don't have the first damn clue.

2:00:44.410 --> 2:00:48.176
Maybe he was an early riser
and liked to pack in the morning.

2:00:48.247 --> 2:00:51.080
And maybe he didn't have any friends.

2:00:51.150 --> 2:00:54.642
I'm an educated man, but I'm afraid
I can't speak intelligently...

2:00:54.720 --> 2:00:58.383
about the travel habits
of William Santiago.

2:00:58.457 --> 2:01:03.485
What I do know is that he was set
to leave the base at 0600.

2:01:04.363 --> 2:01:09.460
Now, are these really the questions
that I was called here to answer?

2:01:09.535 --> 2:01:11.901
Phone calls and footlockers?

2:01:11.971 --> 2:01:15.668
Please tell me that you have
something more, Lieutenant.

2:01:15.741 --> 2:01:19.507
These two Marines
are on trial for their lives.

2:01:19.578 --> 2:01:24.015
Please tell me that their lawyer hasn't
pinned their hopes to a phone bill.

2:01:26.519 --> 2:01:29.955
Do you have any other questions
for me, counselor?

2:01:48.708 --> 2:01:52.235
Lieutenant, do you have anything
further for this witness?

2:01:59.752 --> 2:02:02.016
Thanks, Danny.
I love Washington.

2:02:02.088 --> 2:02:04.682
Excuse me.
I didn't dismiss you.

2:02:05.758 --> 2:02:07.521
I beg your pardon?

2:02:07.593 --> 2:02:12.121
I'm not through with my examination.
Sit down.

2:02:13.833 --> 2:02:16.597
- Colonel.
- What's that?

2:02:16.669 --> 2:02:19.331
I'd appreciate it if you’d address me
as "colonel" or "sir. "

2:02:19.405 --> 2:02:20.997
I believe I've earned it.

2:02:21.073 --> 2:02:25.305
Defense counsel will address
the witness as "colonel" or "sir. "

2:02:25.378 --> 2:02:28.347
I don't know what the hell
kind of unit you're running here.

2:02:28.414 --> 2:02:32.214
The witness will address this court
as "judge" or "your honor. "

2:02:32.284 --> 2:02:37.017
I'm quite certain I've earned it.
Take your seat, Colonel.

2:02:41.994 --> 2:02:46.090
What do you want to discuss now?
My favorite color?

2:02:47.366 --> 2:02:50.062
Colonel, the 6:00 a. m. flight
was the first one off the base?

2:02:50.136 --> 2:02:51.194
Yes.

2:02:51.270 --> 2:02:53.329
There wasn't a flight
that left seven hours earlier...

2:02:53.406 --> 2:02:55.738
and landed at Andrews Air Force Base
at 2:00 a. m.?

2:02:55.808 --> 2:02:58.777
Lieutenant, I think
we've covered this, haven't we?

2:02:59.812 --> 2:03:01.939
Your Honor, these are
the tower chief’s logs...

2:03:02.014 --> 2:03:04.847
for both Guantanamo Bay
and Andrews Air Force Base.

2:03:04.917 --> 2:03:08.284
The Guantanamo log lists no flight
that left at 11:00 p. m.

2:03:08.354 --> 2:03:10.948
The Andrews log lists no flight
that landed at 2:00 a. m.

2:03:11.023 --> 2:03:13.617
I'd like to admit them
as defense exhibits Alpha and Bravo.

2:03:14.393 --> 2:03:17.920
I don't understand. You're admitting
evidence of a flight that never existed.

2:03:17.997 --> 2:03:20.465
We believe it did, sir.

2:03:20.533 --> 2:03:23.832
Defense will be calling Airmen
Cecil O'Malley and Anthony Rodriguez.

2:03:23.903 --> 2:03:26.929
They were working the ground crew
at Andrews at 2:00 a. m. on the 7th.

2:03:27.006 --> 2:03:29.839
- These men weren't on the list.
- Rebuttal witnesses, Your Honor...

2:03:29.909 --> 2:03:34.243
called specifically to refute testimony
offered under direct examination.

2:03:34.313 --> 2:03:37.282
- I'll allow the witnesses.
- This is ridiculous.

2:03:37.349 --> 2:03:41.752
- Colonel, a moment ago-
- Check the tower logs, for Christ's sake!

2:03:42.721 --> 2:03:44.916
We'll get to the airmen
in just a minute, sir.

2:03:45.958 --> 2:03:47.892
A moment ago you said that
you ordered Lieutenant Kendrick...

2:03:47.960 --> 2:03:51.987
to tell his men
that Santiago wasn't to be touched.

2:03:52.064 --> 2:03:53.622
That's right.

2:03:53.699 --> 2:03:56.429
And Lieutenant Kendrick was clear
on what you wanted?

2:03:56.502 --> 2:03:58.299
Crystal.

2:03:58.370 --> 2:04:01.498
Any chance Lieutenant Kendrick
ignored the order?

2:04:01.574 --> 2:04:03.565
Ignored the order?

2:04:03.642 --> 2:04:06.736
Any chance he forgot about it?

2:04:06.812 --> 2:04:10.942
Any chance Lieutenant Kendrick left your
office and said, "The old man is wrong"?

2:04:12.985 --> 2:04:15.249
When Lieutenant Kendrick
spoke to the platoon...

2:04:15.321 --> 2:04:18.586
and ordered them not to touch Santiago,
any chance they ignored him?

2:04:20.025 --> 2:04:23.017
You ever served
in an infantry unit, son?

2:04:23.095 --> 2:04:26.394
- No, sir.
- Ever served in a forward area?

2:04:27.733 --> 2:04:30.759
Ever put your life
in another man's hands?

2:04:30.836 --> 2:04:33.464
Asked him to put his life in yours?

2:04:34.740 --> 2:04:36.708
We follow orders, son.

2:04:36.775 --> 2:04:39.744
We follow orders, or people die.

2:04:39.812 --> 2:04:42.975
It's that simple.
Are we clear?

2:04:43.048 --> 2:04:44.879
Yes, sir.

2:04:44.950 --> 2:04:46.679
Are we clear?

2:04:46.752 --> 2:04:48.686
Crystal.

2:04:50.823 --> 2:04:55.385
I have just one more question before
I call Airmen O'Malley and Rodriguez.

2:04:56.729 --> 2:05:00.995
If you gave an order
that Santiago wasn't to be touched...

2:05:01.066 --> 2:05:03.591
and your orders
are always followed...

2:05:05.571 --> 2:05:08.665
then why would Santiago
be in danger?

2:05:10.576 --> 2:05:14.307
Why would it be necessary
to transfer him off the base?

2:05:19.919 --> 2:05:23.047
Santiago was a substandard Marine.

2:05:23.122 --> 2:05:25.522
- He was being transferred-
- That's not what you said!

2:05:25.591 --> 2:05:29.220
You said he was being transferred
because he was in grave danger.

2:05:29.295 --> 2:05:32.230
I said, "Grave danger?"
You said, "Is there any other kind?"

2:05:32.298 --> 2:05:34.823
- I recall what I said.
- I can have it read back to you.

2:05:34.900 --> 2:05:37.892
I know what I said!
I don't have to have it read back to me.

2:05:37.970 --> 2:05:41.565
Then why the two orders?
Colonel?

2:05:43.509 --> 2:05:46.205
Sometimes men take matters
into their own hands.

2:05:46.278 --> 2:05:49.372
You've made it clear that your men
never take matters into their own hands.

2:05:49.448 --> 2:05:51.416
Your men follow orders,
or people die.

2:05:51.483 --> 2:05:54.111
So Santiago should have been
in danger, should he?

2:05:54.186 --> 2:05:58.054
- You snotty little bastard.
- I'd like to ask for a recess.

2:05:58.123 --> 2:06:01.752
- I'd like an answer to the question.
- The court will wait for an answer.

2:06:02.595 --> 2:06:04.927
If Lieutenant Kendrick
gave an order...

2:06:04.997 --> 2:06:07.966
that Santiago
wasn't to be touched...

2:06:08.033 --> 2:06:09.967
then why did he
have to be transferred?

2:06:12.871 --> 2:06:17.069
Lieutenant Kendrick ordered the Code Red
because that's what you told him to do!

2:06:17.142 --> 2:06:20.134
- Object!
- And then you cut these guys loose!

2:06:20.212 --> 2:06:23.773
- I'll hold you in contempt.
- You doctored the logbook!

2:06:23.849 --> 2:06:26.716
- Damn it, Kaffee!
- Consider yourself in contempt.

2:06:26.785 --> 2:06:29.583
Colonel Jessup,
did you order the Code Red?

2:06:29.655 --> 2:06:33.216
- You don't have to answer that.
- I'll answer the question.

2:06:33.292 --> 2:06:35.317
- You want answers?
- I think I'm entitled!

2:06:35.394 --> 2:06:37.794
- You want answers?
- I want the truth!

2:06:37.863 --> 2:06:40.957
You can't handle the truth!

2:06:41.033 --> 2:06:43.024
Son, we live in a world
that has walls...

2:06:43.102 --> 2:06:45.730
and those walls have to be guarded
by men with guns.

2:06:45.804 --> 2:06:50.173
Who's gonna do it? You?
You, Lieutenant Weinberg?

2:06:50.242 --> 2:06:54.235
I have a greater responsibility
than you can possibly fathom.

2:06:54.313 --> 2:06:57.771
You weep for Santiago,
and you curse the Marines.

2:06:57.850 --> 2:07:01.684
You have the luxury
of not knowing what I know-

2:07:01.754 --> 2:07:05.850
that Santiago's death,
while tragic, probably saved lives.

2:07:05.924 --> 2:07:11.829
And my existence, while grotesque and
incomprehensible to you, saves lives!

2:07:11.897 --> 2:07:16.027
You don't want the truth because
deep down you don't talk about...

2:07:16.101 --> 2:07:18.262
you want me on that wall.

2:07:18.337 --> 2:07:21.033
You need me on that wall!

2:07:21.106 --> 2:07:25.770
We use words
like honor, code, loyalty.

2:07:25.844 --> 2:07:29.541
We use these words as the backbone
of a life spent defending something.

2:07:29.615 --> 2:07:31.606
You use them as a punch line.

2:07:31.684 --> 2:07:35.518
I have neither the time
nor the inclination to explain myself...

2:07:35.587 --> 2:07:39.751
to a man who rises and sleeps under
the blanket of the freedom I provide...

2:07:39.825 --> 2:07:42.692
and then questions the manner
in which I provide it!

2:07:42.761 --> 2:07:46.026
I would rather you just said thank you
and went on your way.

2:07:46.098 --> 2:07:49.864
Otherwise, I suggest you
pick up a weapon and stand a post.

2:07:49.935 --> 2:07:54.838
Either way, I don't give a damn
what you think you are entitled to!

2:07:54.907 --> 2:07:56.568
Did you order the Code Red?

2:07:56.642 --> 2:07:58.576
- I did the job-
- Did you order the Code Red?

2:07:58.644 --> 2:08:00.976
You're goddamned right I did!

2:08:12.024 --> 2:08:15.118
Please the court,
I suggest the members be dismissed...

2:08:15.194 --> 2:08:18.425
so that we can move to an immediate
Article 39-A session.

2:08:18.497 --> 2:08:20.931
The witness has rights.

2:08:20.999 --> 2:08:23.229
Captain Ross?

2:08:34.113 --> 2:08:37.776
The members of the court will retire
to an anteroom until further instructed.

2:08:37.850 --> 2:08:39.647
All rise.

2:08:40.886 --> 2:08:44.378
What the hell is this?
Colonel, what's going on?

2:08:44.456 --> 2:08:46.981
I did my job.
I'd do it again.

2:08:47.059 --> 2:08:50.187
I'm gonna get on a plane
and go on back to my base.

2:08:50.262 --> 2:08:53.959
You're not going anywhere, Colonel.
M.P.s, guard the colonel.

2:08:54.032 --> 2:08:55.465
Yes, sir.

2:08:57.503 --> 2:09:00.028
- Captain Ross.
- What the hell is this?

2:09:00.105 --> 2:09:03.006
Colonel Jessup, you have
the right to remain silent.

2:09:03.075 --> 2:09:07.705
I'm being charged with a crime?
Is that what this is?

2:09:07.780 --> 2:09:11.113
- I'm being charged with a crime?
- You have a right to consult a lawyer.

2:09:11.183 --> 2:09:15.017
- This is funny. That's what this is.
- This lawyer may be appointed by you.

2:09:15.087 --> 2:09:18.784
I'm gonna rip the eyes out of your head
and piss in your dead skull!

2:09:18.857 --> 2:09:20.791
You fucked with the wrong Marine!

2:09:20.859 --> 2:09:24.260
Colonel Jessup, do you understand
these rights as I have just read them?

2:09:30.502 --> 2:09:33.266
You fucking people.

2:09:33.338 --> 2:09:36.102
You have no idea
how to defend a nation.

2:09:36.175 --> 2:09:39.611
All you did was weaken
a country today, Kaffee.

2:09:39.678 --> 2:09:41.669
That's all you did.

2:09:41.747 --> 2:09:46.844
You put people's lives in danger.
Sweet dreams, son.

2:09:46.919 --> 2:09:49.080
Don't call me son.

2:09:49.154 --> 2:09:53.591
I'm a lawyer and an officer
in the United States Navy...

2:09:53.659 --> 2:09:56.423
and you're under arrest,
you son of a bitch.

2:10:00.732 --> 2:10:02.700
The witness is excused.

2:10:24.823 --> 2:10:25.881
All rise.

2:10:37.402 --> 2:10:39.029
Have the members reached a verdict?

2:10:39.104 --> 2:10:41.038
We have, sir.

2:10:52.851 --> 2:10:56.309
Lance Corporal Dawson
and Private First Class Downey.

2:10:59.691 --> 2:11:03.855
On the charge of murder,
the members find the accused...

2:11:03.929 --> 2:11:05.863
not guilty.

2:11:06.932 --> 2:11:10.527
On the charge
of conspiracy to commit murder...

2:11:10.602 --> 2:11:14.368
the members find the accused
not guilty.

2:11:17.175 --> 2:11:21.009
On the charge of conduct
unbecoming a United States Marine...

2:11:21.079 --> 2:11:26.881
the members find the accused
guilty as charged.

2:11:28.854 --> 2:11:32.017
The accused are hereby sentenced
to time already served...

2:11:32.090 --> 2:11:36.959
and you are ordered to be dishonorably
discharged from the Marine Corps.

2:11:38.363 --> 2:11:40.456
This court-martial is adjourned.

2:11:40.532 --> 2:11:42.432
All rise.

2:11:58.250 --> 2:12:00.218
What does that mean?

2:12:02.219 --> 2:12:03.219
Hal?

2:12:05.390 --> 2:12:07.324
What did that mean?

2:12:10.629 --> 2:12:14.827
I don't understand. Colonel Jessup
said he ordered the Code Red.

2:12:14.900 --> 2:12:18.836
- I know.
- What did we do wrong?

2:12:18.904 --> 2:12:22.431
- It's not that simple.
- We did nothing wrong!

2:12:22.507 --> 2:12:23.906
Yeah, we did.

2:12:27.045 --> 2:12:30.947
We were supposed to fight for people
who couldn't fight for themselves.

2:12:32.084 --> 2:12:34.780
We were supposed
to fight for Willie.

2:12:42.561 --> 2:12:45.587
I have to take these men
over to personnel for some paperwork.

2:13:03.949 --> 2:13:06.645
You don't need to wear a patch
on your arm to have honor.

2:13:13.258 --> 2:13:16.352
There's an officer on deck.

2:13:40.252 --> 2:13:42.516
Airmen Cecil O'Malley
and Anthony Rodriguez-

2:13:42.587 --> 2:13:45.420
What exactly were these guys
gonna testify to?

2:13:45.490 --> 2:13:47.685
Unless I'm mistaken, they were both
gonna testify under oath...

2:13:47.759 --> 2:13:50.751
that they had absolutely
no recollection of anything.

2:13:50.829 --> 2:13:54.094
- Strong witnesses.
- And handsome too, don’t you think?

2:13:55.667 --> 2:13:58.329
I'll see you around campus.
I gotta go arrest Kendrick.

2:13:58.403 --> 2:14:01.031
Tell him I say hi.

2:14:01.106 --> 2:14:02.698
Will do.
