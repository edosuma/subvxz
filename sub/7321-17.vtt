00:01.234 --> 00:02.633
<i>Previously on</i> Grey's Anatomy:

00:02.669 --> 00:06.196
<i>You got some problems.</i>
<i>You got some big problems.</i>

00:06.239 --> 00:09.640
- <i>I kissed a peds surgeon.</i>
- Calliope, this is Julie. My date.

00:09.676 --> 00:11.143
I'm seeing Lexie.

00:14.681 --> 00:18.242
- Oh, my God, I think I broke it!
- This is Patient X.

00:18.284 --> 00:22.084
She's a 29-year-old female
we misdiagnosed with anemia.

00:22.122 --> 00:24.920
I'm applying for a fellowship
in Pediatric Sur...

00:24.958 --> 00:26.482
Which is not what we had discussed!

00:26.526 --> 00:28.653
Where's my wife?
You killed her!

00:28.695 --> 00:30.060
You're a murderer.

00:32.499 --> 00:35.468
<i>Every surgeon I know has a shadow.</i>

00:37.237 --> 00:39.171
<i>A dark cloud of fear and doubt</i>

00:39.205 --> 00:42.106
<i>that follows even the best of us</i>
<i>into the OR.</i>

00:42.142 --> 00:44.940
- Dude, he is fried.
- He is not fried.

00:44.978 --> 00:48.675
He lost a patient and got a lawsuit
all in one week, he just needs time.

00:48.715 --> 00:52.082
He's been there for three days.
The cushions are bonding to his ass.

00:52.118 --> 00:55.781
- And he's eating all my cereal.
- He's taking stock.

00:56.089 --> 00:59.752
Something huge and life-altering
happened to him,

00:59.793 --> 01:03.388
and he's taking stock,
figuring out his next move.

01:03.430 --> 01:05.022
We shouldn't judge and rush him.

01:05.065 --> 01:09.729
Whatever. Sylvia Plath's picking out
the marshmallows. They're the best part.

01:09.769 --> 01:11.862
I'm pretty sure he's sitting on my keys.

01:11.905 --> 01:15.432
I'd ask him to move,
but he looks so... comfy.

01:15.475 --> 01:17.670
You guys are cowards.

01:19.712 --> 01:21.111
Hey.

01:21.448 --> 01:24.383
You're eating, that's good.
Appetite is good.

01:24.417 --> 01:28.251
You know what else is good?
Showering. Cleansing. Water.

01:28.288 --> 01:31.314
Are you thinking you'll shower,
go in to the hospital?

01:31.357 --> 01:32.984
I have to for the deposition.

01:33.026 --> 01:36.689
I have to go explain in detail
how I killed a man's pregnant wife.

01:36.996 --> 01:39.794
That's good. Not the killing part,

01:39.833 --> 01:42.802
but the... I think
you'll feel better once you...

01:43.770 --> 01:46.432
...go to... work.

01:52.712 --> 01:54.236
He'll be fine.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.271
<i>We pretend the shadow isn't there.</i>

01:58.184 --> 02:00.778
<i>Hoping that if we save more lives,</i>

02:00.820 --> 02:02.685
<i>master harder techniques,</i>

02:03.156 --> 02:05.090
<i>run faster and farther,</i>

02:05.558 --> 02:08.083
<i>it'll get tired and give up the chase.</i>

02:08.527 --> 02:10.018
<i>But like they say...</i>

02:12.298 --> 02:14.163
<i>You can't outrun your shadow.</i>

02:14.200 --> 02:17.101
Hey.

02:22.542 --> 02:23.873
Morning.

02:31.217 --> 02:35.153
I dreamt once I was falling out a
window, hanging on to the drapes.

02:35.188 --> 02:37.213
I woke up pulling Meredith's hair.

02:38.391 --> 02:40.450
Ha.

02:40.493 --> 02:43.792
So we have a trauma coming,
a trampling on a football field.

02:43.830 --> 02:46.298
- I don't need your help.
- I'm on your service today.

02:46.332 --> 02:49.392
I'm telling you, Dr. Yang,
to take care of that elbow.

02:49.435 --> 02:51.995
There you are.
What happened to you?

02:52.038 --> 02:55.007
- I tripped and fell. It's fine.
- No, no, it's not.

02:57.177 --> 03:01.341
It's... It's nothing. It was
an accident. What's wrong with you?

03:01.915 --> 03:03.746
Derek won't get off the couch.

03:03.783 --> 03:06.274
So the weaker sex.

03:08.221 --> 03:10.689
It's still swollen.
I'd give it another day rest.

03:10.723 --> 03:13.590
- I haven't operated in days.
- Don't hit with your scalpel hand.

03:13.626 --> 03:16.060
- Have you talked to him?
- He threw the first punch.

03:16.095 --> 03:19.553
- You did catch him at a bad time.
- So he lost a patient. Boo-hoo.

03:19.599 --> 03:22.067
We're surgeons, we're men,
we lose patients.

03:22.101 --> 03:25.161
Doesn't give him the right to go around
behaving like a drunk frat boy.

03:25.205 --> 03:28.197
Now I'm supposed to go crawling back,
begging for his forgiveness?

03:29.409 --> 03:32.344
- What... What are you doing?
- Shh, shh, shh.

03:34.447 --> 03:38.349
I went <i>Say Anything</i> on the ped surgeon
in front of the ped surgeon's date,

03:38.384 --> 03:42.047
- so I am hiding from the ped surgeon.
- Mature.

03:42.088 --> 03:44.454
You got in a fist fight. No judging.

03:46.292 --> 03:47.657
- Hi.
- Hand!

03:47.694 --> 03:50.629
Hand! Oh, God, I'm sorry. I forgot.

03:50.663 --> 03:52.631
I am so sorry, I feel terrible,

03:52.665 --> 03:56.260
about everything, about the fight,
and your hand, and Derek and...

03:56.302 --> 03:58.930
He's not doing so well,
I think you should talk to him.

03:58.972 --> 04:01.065
- I should talk to him?!
- Mm-hmm.

04:03.876 --> 04:08.472
Look at you, with your stethoscope
around your neck, charting...

04:08.514 --> 04:10.607
I can totally see you in ten years,

04:10.650 --> 04:13.448
little salt and pepper in your hair,
big shot attending...

04:13.486 --> 04:15.283
You're gonna be a rockstar, Alex.

04:16.822 --> 04:18.723
- What is this?
- What?

04:18.757 --> 04:22.125
I can't fantasize about my boyfriend
and his bright, bright future?

04:23.863 --> 04:25.763
- Shut up.
- Dr. Stevens?

04:25.798 --> 04:28.824
We've been working on the Patient X
case and we have a couple of ideas.

04:28.868 --> 04:30.130
Great. Let's get to work.

04:32.639 --> 04:35.733
What's this Patient X
that's taking the interns?

04:35.775 --> 04:38.539
When's it gonna be over?
I need minions to do my crap work.

04:38.578 --> 04:40.011
Some new teaching thing.

04:40.046 --> 04:44.107
We're killing ourselves to get OR. When
is the last time Izzie held a scalpel?

04:44.150 --> 04:46.675
She's falling behind.
She's like the new O'Malley.

04:46.719 --> 04:49.051
- Izzie's nothing like O'Malley.
- Hello...

04:49.088 --> 04:51.955
OK, O'Malley, you're in the clinic,

04:51.991 --> 04:55.085
Grey and Yang, with me.
Karev, you're in the pit with Hunt.

04:55.128 --> 04:59.326
- Dr. Bailey, I'm on trauma today.
- Save it, Yang. Hunt wants Karev.

04:59.365 --> 05:01.162
Oh! Sir, there you are.

05:01.200 --> 05:03.668
Shepherd planning to grace us
with his presence?

05:03.703 --> 05:05.466
Yes, he's fine.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.901
Sir! I've been trying
to page you all morning.

05:09.942 --> 05:13.605
- I could use help on a case.
- No peds today?

05:13.646 --> 05:14.943
Uh, no.

05:15.448 --> 05:18.975
- Must be slumming.
- Excuse me? Sir...

05:20.119 --> 05:24.681
Tricia Shelley, 31, Megan Shelley, 27,
Michael Shelley, 23.

05:24.724 --> 05:28.660
Genetic testing revealed
they all carry the CDH1 gene

05:28.695 --> 05:30.788
for hereditary diffuse gastric cancer.

05:30.830 --> 05:32.161
Which means what, Dr. Grey?

05:32.198 --> 05:35.463
Which means they all have a 3-in-4
chance of developing the cancer.

05:35.501 --> 05:38.595
Dr. Bailey's taken tumors
out of everyone on our mother's side.

05:38.638 --> 05:42.631
Unfortunately, it's a highly aggressive
cancer, the tumors grow quickly,

05:42.675 --> 05:45.906
- by the time I get in...
- Our family's tree's down to a branch.

05:46.446 --> 05:49.415
How is... Uncle Bud doing?

05:49.449 --> 05:50.507
Dead.

05:51.851 --> 05:53.910
- And Aunt Helen?
- Dead.

05:53.953 --> 05:56.387
- What about the Minnesota cousin?
- Not dead!

05:56.422 --> 06:00.381
- She's 90 pounds and in hospice, Meg.
- Still. Not dead yet.

06:00.426 --> 06:04.726
So, uh, you've decided you're ready
to take the next step.

06:04.764 --> 06:07.426
We've made a pact,
we're all in this together.

06:08.134 --> 06:10.068
Cut our stomachs out, Dr. Bailey.

06:16.442 --> 06:19.502
Beth Dearborn, 17-year-old
with a history of seizures,

06:19.545 --> 06:22.844
had a grand mal during band performance,
started seizing on arrival.

06:22.882 --> 06:24.281
Push two of lorazepam.

06:25.118 --> 06:27.586
She's in v-fib!
Charge the paddles to 200.

06:27.620 --> 06:32.023
The v-fib could be from the seizure.
If she's not in v-fib, she'll flatline.

06:32.058 --> 06:34.925
- You got a pulse?
- I don't think so. It's hard to tell.

06:34.961 --> 06:37.156
- Lorazepam's not working.
- What do we do?

06:37.196 --> 06:40.165
We shock her and save her
or shock her and kill her.

06:43.369 --> 06:45.929
What the hell. Clear!

06:53.312 --> 06:54.438
Clear!

07:04.424 --> 07:06.085
- Sinus tach.
- Good call, Dr. Hunt.

07:06.125 --> 07:08.025
The odds are 50-50 shot.

07:10.062 --> 07:13.088
Oh, no... it happened again?

07:13.132 --> 07:16.295
I'm Dr. Robbins, the pediatric
surgeon on call, this is Dr. Hunt.

07:16.335 --> 07:20.135
You got beat up while marching, I'm
going to check for internal injuries.

07:20.173 --> 07:23.233
I seized during the performance?
But I took my meds...

07:23.276 --> 07:25.642
Relax, it's not like you
crapped your pants.

07:25.678 --> 07:29.739
It is like I crapped my pants. I had
a seizure in front of the entire band.

07:29.782 --> 07:34.242
It is exactly like I crapped my pants.
They're going to kill me.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.221
- Who?
- Seizure patrol.

07:39.459 --> 07:43.520
- You're the seizure patrol?
- I'm first clarinet, he's drum major.

07:43.563 --> 07:45.326
Whenever Beth has a seizure,

07:45.364 --> 07:49.357
we drop our instruments, roll her on her
side so she doesn't choke on her tongue.

07:49.402 --> 07:52.769
We were in the Northwest Regional
Parade. We were favored to win.

07:52.805 --> 07:55.797
Yeah, until Beth took down
the snare drum, woodwinds...

07:55.842 --> 07:58.470
the tubas tried to avoid her
but she was in formation.

07:58.511 --> 08:00.911
Yeah. Why don't you go call her parents?

08:03.382 --> 08:06.613
I'm gonna run some tests, but
she's coded once, so watch her,

08:06.652 --> 08:09.780
- standby with a crash cart.
- You want me to baby-sit?

08:09.822 --> 08:12.848
- That's an intern job.
- I don't see any interns around.

08:15.628 --> 08:17.289
Dr. Grey?

08:17.630 --> 08:20.827
Patient X, a previously healthy
29-year-old female

08:20.867 --> 08:24.268
presented with stable vital signs,
a normal physical exam,

08:24.303 --> 08:28.672
with symptoms of right upper quadrant
pain, nausea, and hallucinations.

08:28.708 --> 08:31.336
Head CT, chest X-ray, CBC were normal,

08:31.377 --> 08:33.743
but chemistries revealed
an elevated LDH.

08:33.779 --> 08:38.842
You are this girl's doctor, she comes to
you, scared, doesn't know what's wrong,

08:38.885 --> 08:41.409
you have to diagnose her.
What do you do next?

08:41.453 --> 08:44.321
- What test do you run?
- A retic count or peripheral smear?

08:44.357 --> 08:47.053
You'd be wasting your time.
The CBC was normal, remember?

08:47.093 --> 08:50.028
You said there was abdominal pain,
what about an upper Gl?

08:50.062 --> 08:51.393
Good.

08:51.430 --> 08:55.298
That is exactly what
Patient X's doctor did next.

08:55.968 --> 08:58.266
What does this tell us?

09:00.573 --> 09:03.235
- What is this?
- Side effects and complications

09:03.276 --> 09:07.110
from prophylactic gastrectomy, so
post-op you know what to expect.

09:07.146 --> 09:10.741
Malnourishment, weakness, fatigue...
dumping syndrome?

09:10.783 --> 09:13.752
- That doesn't sound good.
- Possible anal leakage?!

09:13.786 --> 09:16.721
A gastrectomy isn't like
getting your appendix out.

09:16.756 --> 09:20.624
We're changing the way your digestive
system works, a serious adjustment.

09:20.660 --> 09:23.823
I'm president of my frat,
have a girlfriend, go snowboarding!

09:23.863 --> 09:27.629
How am I supposed to do that when
I'm a weak old man with anal leakage!?

09:27.667 --> 09:29.635
You know how important
this is to Trish.

09:29.669 --> 09:31.864
Trish has run our lives
since we were kids,

09:31.904 --> 09:35.567
she decides where we go to dinner,
vacation, where we do Thanksgiving...

09:35.608 --> 09:38.839
I'm 23. If I don't want to butcher
myself, she can't make me.

09:38.878 --> 09:42.939
So you'd rather die like Mom?
Or Grandpa? Or Uncle Bud?

09:42.982 --> 09:45.644
It's not quick, Mike.
It's a slow, painful way to go.

09:45.685 --> 09:48.176
There's a 1-in-4 shot
we don't get it, right?

09:49.689 --> 09:51.486
- That's something!
- Don't be stupid.

09:51.524 --> 09:56.120
- You are doing this, we discussed...
- You're not in charge of me anymore!

09:57.697 --> 09:59.631
Meg?

10:01.334 --> 10:04.667
I didn't realize it was such a big deal.

10:04.704 --> 10:09.141
I just... I need a little time
to think about it, OK?

10:12.645 --> 10:16.775
No, Callahan on the bypass,
Levin on the appy.

10:16.816 --> 10:19.512
Damn craniotomy.
Where the hell is Shepherd?!

10:19.552 --> 10:22.350
You can't rely on Shepherd.
Is there anything I can do?

10:22.388 --> 10:26.722
My neurosurgeon has been missing
for days, I have no head of cardio,

10:26.759 --> 10:29.227
general surgeons quitting on me
left and right,

10:29.261 --> 10:31.786
surgeries piling up like dead fish
and no surgeons!

10:31.831 --> 10:33.628
Now would be a bad time to tell you

10:33.666 --> 10:37.295
my hand's still out of commission
and I can't operate.

10:39.071 --> 10:41.665
Leave me on the board, chief.
I won't let you down.

10:41.707 --> 10:43.368
I could do that craniotomy.

10:47.446 --> 10:49.346
Um...

10:49.382 --> 10:51.373
Put Dr. Nelson on the craniotomy.

10:52.852 --> 10:55.548
- Appreciate it, John.
- It... It's Jim.

10:56.922 --> 10:59.152
You must be new.
Welcome to Seattle Grace.

10:59.191 --> 11:01.182
I've been here ten years.

11:01.227 --> 11:04.128
I was interim chief of neuro
before Shepherd in his red cape

11:04.163 --> 11:06.097
swooped in from New York.

11:06.132 --> 11:10.398
- Mark Sloan, plastics.
- We've met. Three times.

11:14.573 --> 11:17.440
I don't know why Mr. Bimm
ever let her join band.

11:18.944 --> 11:21.845
- Not like she's a master flautist...
- OK, get out!

11:21.881 --> 11:26.250
- Mr. Bimm said to stay until her...
- I got it! I'm seizure patrol now.

11:30.523 --> 11:33.549
- Your friends are asses.
- They're not my friends.

11:33.592 --> 11:36.527
Once you spazz out in school,
friends are hard to come by.

11:36.562 --> 11:40.464
You can't help the epilepsy, but nobody
made you join the marching band.

11:40.499 --> 11:43.434
- It's spreading nerd on nerd.
- I like being in the band.

11:43.469 --> 11:46.734
It's the one thing I'm good at.
What'd you do in high school?

11:46.772 --> 11:48.933
- I wrestled.
- You're a wrestler?

11:48.974 --> 11:51.738
- You wearing tights under that?
- It was a long time ago.

11:51.777 --> 11:53.870
That was high school,
I'm a surgeon now.

11:53.913 --> 11:57.440
How would you feel if you seized every
time you went into the operating room?

11:57.483 --> 11:59.474
Yeah, OK.

12:02.722 --> 12:06.715
You realize, as your doctor,
I'm not recommending this, right?

12:06.759 --> 12:09.284
I need to get through
my surgeries today.

12:09.328 --> 12:11.762
You're gonna get through them,
just hurt later.

12:11.797 --> 12:14.960
You heard of a Dr. Nelson in neuro?

12:16.202 --> 12:19.729
Oh, yeah.
Shadow Shepherd.

12:19.772 --> 12:21.569
- Shadow Shepherd?
- Yeah.

12:21.607 --> 12:25.873
He's a solid surgeon, but sort of
the JV player to Shepherd's varsity.

12:25.911 --> 12:29.711
The B team to Shepherd's A.
The bricklayer to Shepherd's architect.

12:29.749 --> 12:31.307
I get it.

12:31.350 --> 12:34.342
Just 'cause the guy doesn't
publish fancy clinical trials,

12:34.386 --> 12:38.618
or take on flashy surgeries, or have
creepy perfect hair, he's less of a man?

12:38.657 --> 12:39.988
Kinda.

12:50.569 --> 12:52.469
How'd it go with the lawyers?

12:52.505 --> 12:54.473
They told me my death rate.

12:54.507 --> 12:57.135
These are the people I saved.

12:58.577 --> 13:00.477
These are the people I killed.

13:03.048 --> 13:07.747
Most of those were terminal when they
came to you, you were their last chance.

13:07.787 --> 13:11.518
And you take on impossible cases.
Look at the clinical trial.

13:11.557 --> 13:13.684
There's so many people.

13:13.726 --> 13:16.194
More than Dahmer,
Manson and Bundy combined.

13:16.929 --> 13:19.193
You're not looking at the big picture.

13:22.868 --> 13:25.132
This is the big picture.

13:29.175 --> 13:31.370
Shepherd! Thank God you're back.

13:31.410 --> 13:34.208
- Can you swing two brain biopsies?
- I'm not operating.

13:34.246 --> 13:37.147
I know you've got a big lawsuit
breathing down your neck,

13:37.183 --> 13:39.481
I know you lost a patient,
but I need you back,

13:39.518 --> 13:42.487
- doing the job I hired you to do.
- I am not operating.

13:42.521 --> 13:45.319
I'm not asking,
I'm telling as Chief Surgeon,

13:45.357 --> 13:48.224
if you don't get back
into that OR today, Shepherd...

13:55.701 --> 13:58.534
And he just walked out.
Without saying a word.

13:58.571 --> 14:01.404
Hunt won't look at me since he
went all <i>Apocalypse Now</i> this morning.

14:01.440 --> 14:05.376
Had to get scalpel happy in that
patient's brain and can't face it.

14:05.411 --> 14:08.209
He thinks I'm this wilting flower.
I'm the strong one.

14:08.247 --> 14:11.080
- I'm the strong one.
- If I had that stomach cancer gene?

14:11.116 --> 14:14.176
I'd get that gastrectomy.
I face things, I don't walk away.

14:14.220 --> 14:16.620
Derek walks away.
Maybe walking away is the answer.

14:16.655 --> 14:19.886
It's not emotional, it's science.
Have a problem, don't ignore it.

14:19.925 --> 14:23.053
If you have to pee, and you ignore it,
it does go away.

14:23.095 --> 14:25.620
You guys are hilarious!

14:25.664 --> 14:29.498
Do you even know what she just said?
Or what she just said?

14:29.535 --> 14:32.231
I see you guys in 50 years
in a nursing home,

14:32.271 --> 14:36.605
just talking at each other with
your hearing aids off. Hi-larious.

14:38.077 --> 14:40.443
Oh! I love lunch.

14:50.956 --> 14:52.446
What the hell?

14:53.792 --> 14:55.259
Beth?

14:56.695 --> 14:58.287
Code blue!

15:01.300 --> 15:04.064
After I take out the stomach
I'll do what, Yang?

15:04.103 --> 15:08.938
- Sew the esophageal anastomosis.
- Or the other option is, Grey?

15:08.974 --> 15:12.808
- You could staple the anastomosis.
- Now why would I want to do that?

15:12.845 --> 15:15.177
Fistula rates can be higher
when you hand sew.

15:15.214 --> 15:19.446
You might say that using the old stapler
is sort of my specialty.

15:19.485 --> 15:24.320
Thought your specialty was baby-sitting.
I'm sure you'd rather be doing that.

15:24.356 --> 15:26.483
Frankly, sir, I feel like I am.

15:26.525 --> 15:29.119
Excuse me, sir,
I think you should feel this.

15:29.662 --> 15:31.323
Right here.

15:37.002 --> 15:39.903
Tell me that's not
what I think it is.

15:43.375 --> 15:47.778
Wait, I think I got it. Liver enzymes
are normal, cardiac workup's negative...

15:47.813 --> 15:50.577
- If LDH is a false positive...
- It's a trick question.

15:50.616 --> 15:53.710
- What?
- She's fine. Patient X is fine.

15:54.153 --> 15:57.145
- She's not fine.
- Her SED rate is slightly elevated.

15:57.189 --> 16:00.852
- Did we check for autoimmune disease?
- ANA and CRP were negative.

16:00.893 --> 16:04.920
At worst, she's got an anxiety disorder.
The girl is totally fine.

16:05.564 --> 16:07.998
She is not fine!

16:09.335 --> 16:11.326
She had hallucinations.

16:11.370 --> 16:16.535
She had visual, auditory
and tactile hallucinations

16:16.575 --> 16:19.271
about her dead fiancé.

16:19.311 --> 16:23.338
She thought she could
talk to him and touch him.

16:23.382 --> 16:27.979
She is not fine.

16:31.590 --> 16:33.581
You're missing something.

16:34.226 --> 16:38.595
You're not looking in the right place.
Go back, figure out what you're missing.

16:42.968 --> 16:45.300
She has it? Trish has cancer?

16:45.337 --> 16:50.036
The cancer was stage one. We got to it
so early, the gastrectomy was curative.

16:50.075 --> 16:52.066
She had her endoscopy a few months ago.

16:52.111 --> 16:54.807
It was an aggressive cancer
that grew quickly.

16:54.847 --> 16:58.681
- The fact we took her stomach today...
- It saved your sister's life.

17:02.221 --> 17:04.280
The reason Trish decides everything,

17:04.323 --> 17:07.315
Thanksgiving, dinners, vacations...

17:07.358 --> 17:10.089
She's the only one left
who knows how to cook a turkey, Mike.

17:10.128 --> 17:13.656
She's the only one left
who likes planning vacations,

17:13.699 --> 17:16.759
who ever remembers
to make dinner reservations.

17:16.801 --> 17:20.829
She's in charge of us
because everyone else is dead.

17:21.272 --> 17:23.707
I want it. Now.

17:23.742 --> 17:25.471
I want the surgery right now.

17:32.351 --> 17:35.252
Why is she coding when she seizes?
It doesn't make sense.

17:35.287 --> 17:37.278
Not this young.
Her heart should be fine.

17:37.322 --> 17:41.122
Beth coded before her seizure not
during. I saw her heart go into v-fib.

17:41.160 --> 17:44.652
- She's 17 with no heart history, Karev.
- I saw it on the monitor.

17:44.696 --> 17:48.598
You think you saw it on the monitor.
Seizures are chaotic. Doctors panic...

17:48.634 --> 17:50.465
I didn't panic. I know what I saw.

17:50.502 --> 17:54.268
You suggesting I tell her parents she's
been wrongly treated for six years?

17:54.306 --> 17:56.866
We should run a cardiac workup
with an EP study.

17:56.909 --> 18:01.243
You want me to deliberately shock a
perfectly healthy heart? Absolutely not!

18:03.749 --> 18:06.616
- Dr. Hunt?
- If right, it'd explain the coding.

18:06.652 --> 18:09.485
- If he's wrong, it will kill her!
- I'm not wrong!

18:16.361 --> 18:18.591
Then it's your call, Karev.

18:28.373 --> 18:30.136
Maybe Cristina's right.

18:30.175 --> 18:32.666
Maybe trying to teach the interns
is pointless.

18:32.711 --> 18:35.874
Don't listen to Cristina. She thinks
because you'd rather teach

18:35.914 --> 18:38.815
than take out a gallbladder,
that you're the new me.

18:40.185 --> 18:44.246
- O'Malley the sequel.
- O'Malley 2.0.

18:48.560 --> 18:51.791
You read more journals
and do more research

18:51.830 --> 18:56.096
and log more hours in the skills lab
than any other resident here.

18:56.135 --> 18:58.626
You never give up
trying to be a better doctor.

18:58.670 --> 19:01.400
And you don't step
on other people to do it.

19:02.374 --> 19:04.569
I would be lucky to be the new you.

19:11.049 --> 19:14.450
You gonna tell me about Patient X?

19:14.486 --> 19:17.478
- I know what we missed.
- I gotta go, George.

19:17.523 --> 19:20.287
She had enlarged lymph nodes,
but it's not mono.

19:20.325 --> 19:22.418
What if we missed
a malignancy in her brain?

19:22.461 --> 19:25.123
- You ruled that out with the CT.
- That was a mistake.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.997
I'd like an MRl with contrast,
maybe biopsy a lymph node.

19:28.033 --> 19:30.627
Whatever's wrong,
it's already in her brain.

19:30.669 --> 19:33.729
Yeah.

19:33.772 --> 19:35.467
Clamp's going in.

19:35.507 --> 19:37.065
I don't feel any masses.

19:37.109 --> 19:38.371
2- O vicryl please.

19:38.410 --> 19:42.471
Sir, if I may one more time, I think
stapling would be a better choice.

19:42.514 --> 19:46.006
Dr. Bailey, you no longer wish
to be a surgeon in this hospital.

19:46.051 --> 19:48.019
So leave the technical calls up to me.

19:48.053 --> 19:51.216
I was expressing my opinion
what would be best for my patient.

19:51.256 --> 19:55.022
You don't get an opinion! This is
my patient because it's my hospital.

19:55.060 --> 19:58.188
When it's your hospital
you make decisions, but until then,

19:58.230 --> 20:02.166
this is my hospital and I want
all of you people to do what I say!

20:07.773 --> 20:09.434
Yes, sir.

20:09.474 --> 20:11.669
2- O vicryl, please.

20:20.953 --> 20:25.287
You're gonna be OK.
You're in really good hands.

20:32.998 --> 20:36.456
I'm going to ask you
one more time, Karev.

20:36.501 --> 20:38.332
Are you sure about this?

20:38.971 --> 20:40.461
Yeah.

20:42.641 --> 20:44.404
Then you're on crash cart.

20:44.443 --> 20:46.138
If you're wrong...

20:47.312 --> 20:48.836
...be ready to use it.

21:03.629 --> 21:05.927
Your path report came back clear,

21:05.964 --> 21:09.331
there were no cancerous cells
in your stomach. How's your pain?

21:09.368 --> 21:12.804
The wound hurts a little...
not too bad, right?

21:12.838 --> 21:14.430
Yeah.

21:17.976 --> 21:21.002
Don't you remember how much pain
Mom was in at the end?

21:21.046 --> 21:22.411
No.

21:22.447 --> 21:24.972
You used to help me wet her lips
with an ice cube.

21:25.017 --> 21:27.645
It was awful.
She couldn't even drink.

21:27.686 --> 21:30.416
She had so many tubes everywhere.

21:30.455 --> 21:34.824
I don't remember.
I was two years old when Mom died.

21:34.860 --> 21:37.852
The only reason I know
it was sad and horrible

21:37.896 --> 21:40.694
is because you tell me all the time.

21:41.833 --> 21:44.825
I don't have nightmares about funerals.

21:44.870 --> 21:49.637
I don't freak out and think it's cancer
every time I have indigestion. You do.

21:49.675 --> 21:52.303
- Mike...
- This is your fear.

21:53.011 --> 21:54.569
It's not mine.

21:54.980 --> 21:58.848
So just let me decide when I'm scared.

22:04.389 --> 22:07.290
- Let's take the pace down to 300.
- Vitals are still stable.

22:07.326 --> 22:10.227
This is pointless. The study
is showing no sign of arrhythmia.

22:11.663 --> 22:14.894
- Wait. She's in v-tach.
- Let's pace her out of it at 330.

22:14.933 --> 22:17.060
- BP's down to 60 over 10.
- 340. Damn it.

22:17.102 --> 22:18.467
Karev, get in there, now.

22:19.171 --> 22:21.969
Wait, hold the shock.

22:30.982 --> 22:32.973
She's coming out of it.

22:33.018 --> 22:36.249
This could be ARVC. The right
ventricle's causing arrhythmia.

22:36.288 --> 22:39.917
- The brain doesn't get oxygen.
- And she seizes. Oh, my God.

22:44.062 --> 22:46.394
Karev, you just saved this girl's life.

22:58.777 --> 23:02.474
It's OK. It's OK, just breathe.

23:03.448 --> 23:05.143
Put the paddles down and breathe.

23:05.183 --> 23:08.516
It's OK... it's OK.

23:20.665 --> 23:23.190
Well, it wasn't easy.

23:23.235 --> 23:27.365
Not only did I push through my hare lip
reconstruction and a tympanoplasty,

23:27.406 --> 23:32.173
but I pulled out a burn graft so
beautiful it could bring a man to tears.

23:37.015 --> 23:38.778
Chief?

23:38.817 --> 23:41.183
You haven't heard from Shepherd,
have you?

23:44.623 --> 23:47.490
No, sir. I haven't.

23:49.161 --> 23:54.997
Sir, I have tried to let it go,
I know it's not personal,

23:55.033 --> 23:57.399
I understand it's very hard for you,

23:57.436 --> 24:00.667
I understand you're under
a great deal of pressure,

24:00.705 --> 24:03.902
but the way you yelled at me in the OR,

24:03.942 --> 24:06.706
today, in front of my residents?

24:06.745 --> 24:10.181
Not OK, sir. Not OK at all.

24:10.215 --> 24:15.209
Now you and me, we're going to have
to find a way to work together so you...

24:16.688 --> 24:18.315
Not talking to me now?

24:19.558 --> 24:21.048
Oh! Well...

24:21.092 --> 24:25.028
That's just real mature, sir.

24:26.531 --> 24:28.556
Real mature.

24:31.770 --> 24:33.601
We have a diagnosis.

24:36.241 --> 24:37.606
Go ahead, Dr. Grey.

24:37.642 --> 24:42.409
Patient X. An elevated LDH
was our only clue.

24:42.447 --> 24:46.679
We found out she had enlarged lymph
nodes and a mole, which was biopsied.

24:46.718 --> 24:51.655
Meanwhile, this MRl with contrast showed
a met on her right temporal lobe.

24:51.690 --> 24:54.250
The biopsy revealed dividing cells.

24:54.292 --> 24:56.692
That, coupled with
further staging tests,

24:56.728 --> 25:00.027
led to our final diagnosis
of metastatic melanoma

25:00.065 --> 25:02.898
with mets to the liver,
skin, and brain.

25:08.807 --> 25:13.244
- Your prognosis?
- With chemo and radiation...

25:13.278 --> 25:16.008
- ...a few months.
- At best. The girl's toast.

25:16.047 --> 25:18.140
Survival rate's five percent.

25:18.183 --> 25:21.016
If I were her I'd go
on a really good vacation.

25:28.527 --> 25:30.495
Good job, everybody.

25:31.563 --> 25:33.087
That's it?

25:33.131 --> 25:36.692
- The last contest, we got a prize.
- What's our prize?

25:39.571 --> 25:44.702
You think every time you hand someone
a death sentence there's a prize?

25:46.645 --> 25:51.082
The prize is, you didn't
screw it up this time.

25:51.116 --> 25:54.017
The prize is, you people actually did
something right.

25:54.052 --> 25:58.989
The prize is, you were doctors today!
You are doctors. That is the prize.

26:15.073 --> 26:19.237
- Adele, what are you doing here?
- Conference room, Richard. Now.

26:20.979 --> 26:23.379
You too, Miranda. Let's go.

26:31.022 --> 26:35.118
It's a pacemaker. It's gonna
regulate your abnormal arrhythmias,

26:35.160 --> 26:37.720
so you won't have any more seizures.

26:38.296 --> 26:42.255
So... I'm not sick anymore?

26:43.101 --> 26:44.227
A wrestler fixed me.

26:44.269 --> 26:46.635
Not exactly. You have
a serious heart condition,

26:46.671 --> 26:48.866
we're gonna set you up with
a cardiologist...

26:48.907 --> 26:52.001
But no one has to know.
I won't be frothing at the mouth,

26:52.043 --> 26:54.705
I don't have to wear
a bracelet to school.

26:54.746 --> 26:58.375
- I can cover this with a shirt.
- Yeah. That's something.

26:59.250 --> 27:03.949
It's everything. Once people see you
as sick, they don't see anything else.

27:06.992 --> 27:09.961
Mr. Bimm just called.
We didn't get a trophy.

27:11.363 --> 27:13.092
There's next season.

27:13.131 --> 27:16.828
Yeah, we were thinking, maybe you
should try out for choir or debate.

27:16.868 --> 27:22.272
Something requiring less movement.
We're just worried for your safety.

27:22.307 --> 27:26.869
You don't have to be.
We fixed her. Epileptic bone.

27:26.911 --> 27:27.969
What?

27:28.013 --> 27:30.004
There's no such thing
as an epileptic bone.

27:30.048 --> 27:31.106
Are you a doctor?

27:34.519 --> 27:37.488
So she's like... totally normal now?

27:37.522 --> 27:41.458
Dude, none of you are normal.
You're freaking band nerds.

27:49.034 --> 27:51.798
Of all the petty,
ridiculous, infantile...

27:51.836 --> 27:54.100
Are you running a hospital
or a playground?

27:54.139 --> 27:57.404
- Adele, I will not be spoken to...
- Hospital or playground?!

28:00.045 --> 28:02.343
- Hospital.
- Then start acting like

28:02.380 --> 28:06.783
the chief of a hospital and
apologize to that woman. Right now.

28:08.453 --> 28:10.978
- Sorry.
- You call that an apology!?

28:11.022 --> 28:13.923
Now you better not leave this room
until you work this out.

28:13.958 --> 28:17.553
If I have to drag myself here
through rush hour traffic again

28:17.595 --> 28:21.326
- to police this damn jungle gym...
- Adele, you've made your point.

28:23.501 --> 28:26.368
And you wipe that smile off your face.
You're no better.

28:26.404 --> 28:29.168
Tattling on a man to his wife.

28:31.776 --> 28:34.768
When you have your stomach out,
you can't eat sugar.

28:34.813 --> 28:38.681
If he's doing this because he doesn't
want to give up damn jelly beans...

28:38.717 --> 28:40.912
- It's more than that.
- Or football

28:40.952 --> 28:43.978
or girls or snowboarding,
whatever, it doesn't matter.

28:44.022 --> 28:47.458
- Not compared to the alternative.
- We'll be as vigilant as we can.

28:47.492 --> 28:50.757
- Use every screening tool available.
- That won't be necessary.

28:50.795 --> 28:54.128
Mikey's gonna have the surgery.
Maybe not today,

28:54.165 --> 28:57.623
but I'm gonna be on him like glue,
to my dying breath, until he does.

28:57.669 --> 29:00.502
And if he
just wants to be left alone?

29:00.538 --> 29:03.871
You don't leave the people
you love alone, Dr. Grey.

29:03.908 --> 29:07.366
That idiot may not know it, but my
fear is what's going to save his life.

29:15.854 --> 29:19.654
I learned a lot, diagnosing a patient
from beginning to end.

29:19.691 --> 29:23.183
So... thank you for teaching us.

29:26.397 --> 29:27.989
What would you say?

29:30.802 --> 29:34.568
To Patient X. How would you
break the news?

29:36.107 --> 29:37.301
Um...

29:37.342 --> 29:40.277
I would say that I was very sorry

29:40.311 --> 29:43.405
and that there were support groups...

29:45.116 --> 29:49.314
I don't know. What do you say
to somebody who's going to...

29:50.889 --> 29:53.653
You say they have a choice.

29:54.692 --> 29:58.287
They can run away and hide from it,
or they can face it.

29:58.730 --> 30:00.891
You say to be around people
who love them,

30:00.932 --> 30:04.265
it's gonna be the toughest fight of
their life, no one should do it alone.

30:04.302 --> 30:07.100
And then you give them the odds,

30:07.138 --> 30:11.541
and even though a five percent survival
rate is bad, it's really bad, you say...

30:15.413 --> 30:19.543
- You say...
- Screw the odds.

30:19.584 --> 30:22.280
People die of the hiccups.

30:22.320 --> 30:24.345
My mother died of the hiccups.

30:24.756 --> 30:28.920
Survival rate for that is, what,
100 percent?

30:29.627 --> 30:32.721
The odds are that she
should be alive right now.

30:32.764 --> 30:35.733
The odds are that the odds mean crap.

30:37.168 --> 30:40.569
So people should face it
and they should fight.

30:44.008 --> 30:46.169
Maybe not those words.

30:47.412 --> 30:51.746
No... exactly those words.

30:54.853 --> 30:57.014
Thank you, Dr. Grey.

31:01.559 --> 31:03.083
How's she doing?

31:03.127 --> 31:05.425
- Uh, she's stable.
- Hmm.

31:06.431 --> 31:07.989
You did a hell of a job.

31:08.032 --> 31:11.866
- The chief's gonna hear about it.
- Pretty impressive for a resident.

31:11.903 --> 31:15.066
Fix that attitude, you could be
the future of this hospital,

31:15.106 --> 31:18.974
the one to watch.
You go, Karev!

31:26.050 --> 31:27.574
Iz!

31:28.786 --> 31:31.778
Hunt's letting me do the distal
anastomosis on his fem-pop.

31:31.823 --> 31:33.916
- That's awesome.
- It's crazy.

31:33.958 --> 31:39.123
They told me I could be the future
of this hospital, the resident to watch.

31:39.163 --> 31:41.893
I mean, I'm not the kind of guy who...

31:41.933 --> 31:44.629
I don't rise, OK? I sink to the bottom.

31:44.669 --> 31:47.866
And now I'm getting all
this... this respect.

31:47.906 --> 31:52.673
And... And you... you gotta stop wasting
your time with this Patient X crap.

31:53.144 --> 31:55.305
- Alex...
- I know you like teaching,

31:55.346 --> 31:59.942
but you need to start treating
real patients with real surgeries

31:59.984 --> 32:03.317
because once they see you as weak,
it's over, and Iz...

32:03.354 --> 32:05.151
...you could be a great surgeon.

32:05.189 --> 32:07.987
We could be great together.

32:08.026 --> 32:11.052
You just, you gotta stop
screwing around.

32:11.095 --> 32:15.429
I don't wanna be the future of this
hospital if you're not with me. OK?

32:17.001 --> 32:18.525
OK.

32:22.006 --> 32:23.974
- Alex!
- What?

32:52.437 --> 32:55.304
- You told Adele on me?
- You stopped speaking to me.

32:55.340 --> 32:58.036
That didn't exactly leave me
many options.

32:58.076 --> 33:02.979
Would you have reacted like this
if I left general surgery for neuro?

33:03.014 --> 33:05.005
- Or cardio?
- I don't follow.

33:05.049 --> 33:08.109
Is it because you regard peds
as a soft specialty,

33:08.152 --> 33:09.642
is that what's bothering you?

33:09.687 --> 33:12.349
- That's ridiculous.
- Maybe. But...

33:12.390 --> 33:15.723
It seems that every time I do something
you perceive as "soft,"

33:15.760 --> 33:19.355
like having a baby,
taking some time off to see my baby,

33:19.397 --> 33:23.128
specializing in babies...
I'm dead to you.

33:23.701 --> 33:26.169
- Wanna know what I think?
- Not particularly.

33:26.204 --> 33:30.368
I think you're scared
that you've gone soft.

33:30.408 --> 33:33.377
You blame this hospital's decline on it.
Know what I think?

33:33.411 --> 33:36.437
- You're gonna tell me.
- It's not doing you one bit of good!

33:36.481 --> 33:38.381
Surgeons are dropping like dominoes.

33:38.416 --> 33:41.510
So, maybe it's time you got in touch
with your feminine side.

33:41.552 --> 33:44.112
Maybe you need a little soft.

33:47.959 --> 33:50.826
You still shouldn't have
ratted me out.

33:50.862 --> 33:54.764
- Sorry.
- Me, too.

34:03.074 --> 34:04.371
What are you doing?

34:04.409 --> 34:06.843
Assigning myself to trauma
with you tomorrow.

34:06.878 --> 34:10.507
I'm a big girl.
I can handle my share of trauma.

34:10.547 --> 34:12.777
And I get to decide
when I've had enough.

34:15.420 --> 34:19.117
It's gonna take a lot more
than a bad dream to scare me off.

34:21.626 --> 34:23.753
It is more than a bad dream.

34:25.963 --> 34:27.954
I know.

34:43.614 --> 34:48.141
I know I have no business
asking you for anything,

34:48.186 --> 34:49.813
but I need your help.

34:49.853 --> 34:51.879
I need you to bring Derek back.

34:55.025 --> 34:57.358
And he's not "fine."

35:00.131 --> 35:03.225
Sometimes people just want
to be left alone.

35:15.880 --> 35:18.405
He's planning to propose.

35:19.217 --> 35:23.278
He's been carrying around
a big ring for weeks.

35:23.321 --> 35:26.222
That's not a man who wants
to be left alone.

35:31.996 --> 35:34.521
I just thought you should know.

35:48.546 --> 35:52.004
Yes, the odds are against us.
I'm a one woman wrecking ball.

35:52.049 --> 35:55.951
All I do is break you. Your hand, penis,
relationships, your life...

35:55.987 --> 36:01.015
I'd say our survival rate
is about three percent. And that's bad.

36:01.058 --> 36:03.026
But it's not nothing.

36:03.060 --> 36:05.927
I don't think we should
give up on this. Not yet...

36:06.898 --> 36:07.956
OK.

36:09.567 --> 36:11.762
You think you broke me, Little Grey?

36:13.171 --> 36:15.605
You're the one who put me back together.

36:22.113 --> 36:23.944
- Hand.
- Hand.

36:24.749 --> 36:28.947
Mark. I've got a couple of
Shepherd's post-ops to check in on,

36:28.986 --> 36:32.444
- but after that, feel like a drink?
- How about a rain check, John?

36:33.457 --> 36:35.357
Jim.

36:36.227 --> 36:38.559
It's Jim.

36:47.572 --> 36:52.168
So I've had quite a day.
Got my ass handed to me by Alex Karev.

36:52.210 --> 36:56.044
A second year resident.
Which is humbling for a surgeon,

36:56.080 --> 37:00.346
- especially a know-it-all...
- We don't have to do this, be friends.

37:00.384 --> 37:03.512
It's a big hospital, lots of floors,
lots of places to hide.

37:03.554 --> 37:06.250
I'm perfectly OK with doing that
for the next few years.

37:06.290 --> 37:08.884
You're not hearing me, Calliope.

37:08.926 --> 37:11.451
Sometimes I panic in the moment,
I call it wrong.

37:11.495 --> 37:13.725
I misjudge a situation.

37:13.764 --> 37:18.167
So if you're up for it,
I'd like to take you to dinner.

37:22.807 --> 37:24.274
Maybe.

37:25.276 --> 37:26.800
Maybe?

37:26.844 --> 37:30.871
My schedule's kind of insane right now,
so... I'll get back to you.

37:35.353 --> 37:37.719
How's, uh, tomorrow?

37:52.970 --> 37:54.904
- Good night, Iz.
- Night.

37:59.510 --> 38:00.841
Um...

38:00.878 --> 38:03.745
I've been keeping my distance
'cause you're with Alex.

38:03.781 --> 38:08.115
I just want to let you know
I'm still here. I still care.

38:09.754 --> 38:11.016
Thanks, George.

38:11.055 --> 38:13.046
And you don't want to talk about it?

38:13.090 --> 38:14.853
Not yet.

38:16.193 --> 38:18.991
- OK. Good night.
- Night.

38:29.874 --> 38:32.434
You don't like me very much, do you?

38:32.476 --> 38:34.603
- Uh...
- No. That's good.

38:34.645 --> 38:37.443
It's good. Because I need
to tell you something.

38:37.915 --> 38:43.114
I need to tell you because I need
to tell somebody and... you're a robot.

38:43.888 --> 38:45.651
You can take it.

38:46.590 --> 38:47.921
OK.

38:49.860 --> 38:53.318
- I can't tell you here.
- OK.

38:53.364 --> 38:56.822
- I can't...
- OK.

38:58.736 --> 39:00.169
OK.

39:19.690 --> 39:23.251
You cleaned all of your clothes
out of the house.

39:23.294 --> 39:25.228
Go home, Meredith. Just go home.

39:25.262 --> 39:27.753
How long are you
planning on hiding out here?

39:27.798 --> 39:30.426
That's what you're doing.
You're hiding.

39:30.968 --> 39:35.632
You made a mistake, she's dead.
You can't hide from that.

39:35.673 --> 39:38.836
I'm not hiding, I'm done.

39:38.876 --> 39:40.901
I'm done operating.

39:40.945 --> 39:43.243
Oh, OK, so you're just quitting?

39:43.280 --> 39:46.716
You should understand,
you wrote the book on quitting,

39:46.751 --> 39:49.914
running, hiding...
You've written a lot of books, Meredith.

39:49.954 --> 39:53.253
That may be true, but I'm here now.

39:54.892 --> 39:57.759
You're here now?

39:59.597 --> 40:03.294
- You wanted me out since I moved in.
- That is not true.

40:03.334 --> 40:06.394
You are incapable of anything
that resembles commitment.

40:06.437 --> 40:09.895
You lied to me.
You said you were healthier,

40:09.940 --> 40:11.840
you were healed.

40:11.876 --> 40:14.401
There's no fixing you.
You're a lemon.

40:14.445 --> 40:16.242
Derek Shepherd, you are drunk.

40:17.915 --> 40:21.009
And you're angry.
And I've been there, so I get it.

40:21.051 --> 40:23.611
- That doesn't give you the right...
- Go home.

40:23.654 --> 40:25.781
- You don't get to...
- This is what you want,

40:25.823 --> 40:27.518
I'm giving you an out. Go!

40:27.558 --> 40:31.016
- I'm not going anywhere.
- I said leave! Meredith, leave!

40:37.868 --> 40:40.860
I know there's a ring.

40:42.673 --> 40:45.073
- What?
- The chief told me.

40:45.109 --> 40:46.906
I know there's a ring.

40:52.583 --> 40:54.073
You want the ring?

41:04.328 --> 41:05.693
Here's your ring.

41:08.632 --> 41:11.465
<i>Every surgeon has a shadow.</i>

41:13.704 --> 41:17.572
That the best you've got?
I'm not bailing. We're in this together.

41:18.809 --> 41:20.902
Go home, Meredith.

41:20.945 --> 41:23.413
<i>And the only way</i>
<i>to get rid of a shadow...</i>

41:25.850 --> 41:27.818
<i>...is to turn off the lights,</i>

41:28.686 --> 41:31.211
<i>to stop running from the darkness...</i>

41:33.657 --> 41:35.648
<i>...and face what you fear...</i>

41:40.297 --> 41:41.889
<i>...head on.</i>
