00:05.840 --> 00:09.593
"In Ancient Greece,
sexual encounters occurred freely

00:09.677 --> 00:12.763
This shows that there were
already swinger parties

00:12.847 --> 00:14.390
in the time before Christ."

00:22.565 --> 00:24.233
Hey, where are you going?

00:24.650 --> 00:26.235
To Siena's party.

00:26.694 --> 00:27.737
What?

00:29.071 --> 00:30.281
Didn't you cancel?

00:30.406 --> 00:32.992
I did. You and Leo
are no longer invited.

00:33.075 --> 00:34.285
And I am going.

00:37.204 --> 00:38.372
You're kidding me.

00:38.956 --> 00:41.667
You said I wanted to fuck everybody,

00:41.667 --> 00:44.795
so I'm going to prove you right.

00:45.296 --> 00:48.466
Are you serious? Is Sergio going?

00:49.049 --> 00:52.094
Well, I guess so.
He and Siena are together.

00:55.681 --> 00:58.225
Wow, Mom! You look gorgeous.

00:58.309 --> 00:59.602
Thank you, honey.

01:00.853 --> 01:01.979
Where are you going?

01:02.688 --> 01:04.982
A party with my friends.

01:06.275 --> 01:07.276
Without dad?

01:07.610 --> 01:09.445
Yes. Without dad.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.739
Wow! So modern!

01:12.281 --> 01:13.282
Cool.

01:15.242 --> 01:17.787
My cab is here. I have to go now.

01:18.704 --> 01:20.289
Bye, Mom. Enjoy.

01:21.290 --> 01:23.042
- I love you.
- I love you too.

01:26.378 --> 01:27.505
Alright, Dad.

01:28.005 --> 01:29.548
I'm going to bed.

01:30.716 --> 01:33.052
- Sweet dreams.
- Sweet dreams.

01:41.560 --> 01:42.686
Carmen?

01:43.437 --> 01:45.314
- Here, madam.
- Carmen? Where are you?

01:45.606 --> 01:47.858
Carmen, please. Be honest.

01:48.317 --> 01:49.527
How do I look?

01:50.486 --> 01:51.529
Gorgeous.

01:51.654 --> 01:54.114
Just don't wear panties,
your ass looks great.

01:54.406 --> 01:57.201
Really? I prefer
to have them taken off later.

01:57.993 --> 01:59.829
Carmen, if Leo calls,

02:00.412 --> 02:02.498
tell him
I'm not coming back tonight.

02:02.623 --> 02:04.708
I'll be fucking all night.

02:04.959 --> 02:06.126
Gladly.

02:06.752 --> 02:09.463
Get me a tequila,
and one for you too.

02:09.839 --> 02:11.966
Your ass is great too.

02:12.383 --> 02:13.634
I don't drink.

02:14.009 --> 02:16.929
Leo, have you heard?
We were uninvited to the party.

02:17.012 --> 02:19.598
Yes, I know.
But we're going anyway.

02:20.057 --> 02:22.601
I have the address.
Everything is sorted out.

02:22.685 --> 02:24.562
Pick me up. Hurry.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.188
Okay. I'm on my way.

02:31.777 --> 02:33.988
- Ready?
- Ready.

02:36.073 --> 02:37.825
- You look gorgeous.
- You too.

02:38.784 --> 02:42.037
- I'm glad you've changed your mind.
- Siena talked me into it.

02:43.622 --> 02:46.333
After all, this is going to be
the last Game of Keys that we play.

02:47.918 --> 02:49.879
Yes. Our last game.

02:50.796 --> 02:52.089
Then, we'll have a baby.

02:54.425 --> 02:56.302
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

02:58.762 --> 03:01.765
THE GAME OF KEYS

03:11.400 --> 03:14.403
- Adriana Romero.
- Bárbara Navarro.

03:15.988 --> 03:17.781
Gaby and Valentín Lombardo.

03:23.579 --> 03:24.747
See that?

03:26.999 --> 03:28.959
Look at that guy, please.

03:29.126 --> 03:31.211
Hello! Are you ready?

03:31.295 --> 03:34.924
- Hi!
- Siena, your old friends are here!

03:35.007 --> 03:36.008
Really?

03:38.761 --> 03:40.387
I'm so glad you've made it.

03:40.512 --> 03:42.056
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

03:42.139 --> 03:43.557
- You're beautiful.
- You too.

03:43.599 --> 03:45.059
- Hi.
- Hi.

03:47.061 --> 03:50.314
I wouldn't have missed this
for the world.

03:50.397 --> 03:51.899
Big party, eh?

03:52.316 --> 03:54.568
How does this work?

03:54.652 --> 03:57.571
First of all,
you need to get your cloaks.

03:57.947 --> 03:59.990
- Cloaks?
- Right.

04:00.824 --> 04:02.743
- Follow me.
- Cloaks!

04:04.703 --> 04:06.246
- Let's go.
- You need to see that guy.

04:06.330 --> 04:07.498
Valentín?

04:11.585 --> 04:14.004
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks, Valentín.

04:14.171 --> 04:17.216
Thank you for everything
you've done for me.

04:18.384 --> 04:22.179
- I didn't see Daniel around.
- Don't worry, he'll be here.

04:22.304 --> 04:23.847
- Are you sure?
- I am.

04:24.431 --> 04:25.891
Everything is sorted out.

04:26.350 --> 04:28.644
You and he will get the same key.

04:29.687 --> 04:30.854
Just relax.

04:31.814 --> 04:32.940
Roberto?

04:36.443 --> 04:37.695
Thank you, handsome.

04:38.696 --> 04:39.738
Here.

04:41.949 --> 04:42.992
Are you sure?

04:43.409 --> 04:44.618
I'm sure.

04:46.328 --> 04:47.538
Trust me.

04:48.080 --> 04:49.415
It's going to be fine.

04:52.584 --> 04:56.505
Here are options
less threatening than Sergio.

04:57.923 --> 05:00.342
I don't know why you say that.
I'm not interested in Sergio.

05:02.761 --> 05:04.096
Your cloaks.

05:06.140 --> 05:07.516
You scared me!

05:08.017 --> 05:09.935
The scarier the better.

05:10.019 --> 05:13.397
- Bárbara, please!
- Sorry. I'm just nervous.

05:14.189 --> 05:16.608
- Thanks.
- And your cell phones, please.

05:19.278 --> 05:21.572
- Shall we hand them over?
- Yes.

05:22.114 --> 05:25.492
We'll explain everything.
Just relax. Everything's fine.

05:26.744 --> 05:28.370
- Enjoy.
- Come on.

05:29.913 --> 05:32.583
- Look at this!
- I want to take a look.

05:38.297 --> 05:40.340
- This is yours.
- A cloak.

05:40.382 --> 05:41.592
Your cell.

05:43.719 --> 05:45.471
- Thanks.
- Come on.

05:47.556 --> 05:48.932
Names, please.

05:49.141 --> 05:51.226
Óscar Leal and Leo Cuevas.

05:53.687 --> 05:56.356
We forgot our invitations,
but our names must be on the list.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.028
Here you are.

06:01.278 --> 06:03.614
- Told you.
- You're on the black list.

06:04.573 --> 06:06.075
What do you mean?

06:06.200 --> 06:08.702
We were invited.

06:09.119 --> 06:10.370
Comrades.

06:10.621 --> 06:13.082
Disobey your orders and let us in.

06:13.332 --> 06:16.168
Don't be the slaves
of the bourgeois who have you here,

06:16.460 --> 06:19.630
working for peanuts
while they're having fun.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.298
Leo, enough.

06:22.007 --> 06:25.302
- This is a fight, we can't give up.
- Fine, it's a fight.

06:25.469 --> 06:28.013
But I don't want to end up
in the police station again.

06:28.639 --> 06:29.681
Get in.

06:30.224 --> 06:32.059
Okay, fine. Let's go.

06:33.185 --> 06:34.353
Fat ass.

06:45.989 --> 06:48.909
Thank you all for coming
to my birthday party

06:48.992 --> 06:50.994
at this lovely mansion

06:51.120 --> 06:54.373
provided by our generous sponsor.

06:55.082 --> 06:56.834
Before we start,

06:57.126 --> 07:00.003
I would like to remind you
the ground rules of this game.

07:00.671 --> 07:04.466
Consent, condoms...

07:05.175 --> 07:06.510
and so on.

07:07.302 --> 07:10.389
But this time,
some rules will change.

07:11.181 --> 07:15.644
In open spaces, silence is mandatory.

07:16.603 --> 07:19.815
And we'll all have to keep
our masks on.

07:20.482 --> 07:21.567
Understood?

07:23.694 --> 07:27.072
You'll find rooms with two, three...

07:27.656 --> 07:29.575
or more people.

07:30.492 --> 07:32.828
It all depends
on the key you've chosen.

07:34.079 --> 07:35.289
The rest...

07:35.747 --> 07:39.042
is up to your imagination
and sex drive.

07:40.169 --> 07:43.547
Let the Game of Keys begin!

07:48.302 --> 07:49.553
Good luck.

07:50.012 --> 07:52.431
"I want to fuck."

07:52.931 --> 07:54.516
- See you later.
- Fine.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.835
- Help me here.
- There you go.

08:21.960 --> 08:23.837
- Jump!
- Wait.

08:24.338 --> 08:26.048
Hurry, you're too heavy.

08:27.132 --> 08:28.759
I'll catch you if you fall.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.096
Watch your step!

08:52.199 --> 08:53.700
Oh, I'm sorry.

08:54.534 --> 08:57.788
I didn't expect to find anyone here.

08:57.871 --> 09:01.208
I mean, I was expecting someone else.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.210
This is a misunderstanding.

09:03.335 --> 09:07.214
Actually, I was expecting someone...

09:10.384 --> 09:12.344
Oh, you smell so good...

09:13.470 --> 09:14.638
Well, I...

09:15.222 --> 09:17.432
I was waiting for...

09:17.474 --> 09:20.018
A couple of minutes, and then...

09:20.811 --> 09:22.020
I'll leave.

09:39.371 --> 09:40.455
Pato?

09:42.791 --> 09:43.875
I'm sorry, Adriana.

09:44.001 --> 09:46.753
I didn't get the steroids today,
I thought I'd last longer.

09:47.129 --> 09:49.131
Just give me a second chance.

09:49.214 --> 09:52.009
No. Don't worry. It's okay.

09:52.134 --> 09:54.553
Actually, it's not you.

09:54.636 --> 09:57.055
I need to do something else, so...

09:57.139 --> 09:59.516
- I'll be right back.
- Just give me a second chance.

09:59.599 --> 10:01.893
No. It's okay. Cheer up.

10:02.227 --> 10:03.687
- Please?
- Okay?

10:04.021 --> 10:05.314
Adriana, don't go.

10:18.827 --> 10:19.828
María?

10:22.205 --> 10:23.832
Gaby, what a surprise!

10:24.374 --> 10:25.751
What are you doing here?

10:26.585 --> 10:28.086
Siena invited us.

10:29.588 --> 10:30.881
Where is Daniel?

10:31.089 --> 10:32.924
- What?
- Where is Daniel?

10:34.051 --> 10:36.428
I don't know.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.247
Why does this always happen to me?

11:04.956 --> 11:07.959
- What happened?
- What use is this body to me...

11:08.502 --> 11:11.880
- if I can't satisfy a woman?
- Yeah, right.

11:12.756 --> 11:16.343
Maybe she isn't the right woman.

11:17.260 --> 11:19.846
Hey, have you seen Adriana?
I've been looking for her.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.349
Yes. I was all over her.

11:22.557 --> 11:24.309
But she left.

11:26.228 --> 11:27.396
Forget it.

11:28.438 --> 11:29.773
- Sergio?
- What?

11:29.898 --> 11:30.857
Sergio!

11:30.941 --> 11:34.027
- What?
- Do you fancy a threesome?

11:34.111 --> 11:35.695
I could last longer.

11:35.946 --> 11:38.365
- I don't think so.
- Sergio...

11:39.324 --> 11:42.619
Listen. Just imagine,
your experience...

11:43.161 --> 11:45.831
my muscles...
You and me in the same bed...

11:46.123 --> 11:47.624
I don't know. Just consider it.

11:48.917 --> 11:50.377
No, Pato. It's okay.

11:50.710 --> 11:51.878
Sergio...

11:52.546 --> 11:53.839
See you, Pato.

11:56.716 --> 11:57.634
Valentín!

12:00.053 --> 12:03.223
What are you doing here?
I thought you weren't invited.

12:03.932 --> 12:06.476
Please do not turn me in.
I'm looking for Adriana.

12:06.726 --> 12:07.853
Have you seen her?

12:11.523 --> 12:12.816
She went that way.

12:13.650 --> 12:15.193
- Did she?
- Yes.

12:15.277 --> 12:17.446
- That way.
- Don't say anything.

12:17.696 --> 12:19.072
Fuck.

12:43.680 --> 12:44.764
Sergio?

12:45.974 --> 12:47.100
Hey!

12:47.893 --> 12:49.853
I thought you were in another room.

12:51.146 --> 12:53.690
I wanted to wish you
a happy birthday.

12:55.442 --> 12:56.610
Join us.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.445
What are you waiting for?

13:03.116 --> 13:04.409
You're right.

13:55.001 --> 13:58.547
Maybe next time.
I'm looking for someone.

14:19.776 --> 14:22.529
I had a boob job
after my second baby,

14:22.612 --> 14:24.698
but they do feel real, don't they?

14:26.658 --> 14:28.368
- Bárbara?
- It tickles.

14:28.451 --> 14:29.869
Hey, Gaby.

14:29.953 --> 14:31.746
I can't find Valentín.

14:32.163 --> 14:33.832
Then join us.

14:33.999 --> 14:35.875
There's enough room.

14:36.042 --> 14:37.627
- Come here.
- Come on!

14:37.711 --> 14:41.006
Why is it so important
what Valentín is doing? Gaby!

14:47.971 --> 14:49.180
Come in.

14:58.815 --> 14:59.941
Here we are.

15:02.736 --> 15:04.613
The plan turned out perfect.

15:06.281 --> 15:07.699
Everything is fine.

15:09.326 --> 15:10.619
Alone, at last.

15:12.370 --> 15:13.496
Yes.

15:15.707 --> 15:17.500
There's no reason to be nervous.

15:21.212 --> 15:22.839
It's my first time.

15:23.131 --> 15:24.549
I'll guide you.

15:37.479 --> 15:38.647
Bárbara?

15:43.068 --> 15:44.152
Valentín?

15:46.404 --> 15:48.990
- Leo, what are you doing here?
- Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

15:49.074 --> 15:51.451
We are all open-minded.

15:51.701 --> 15:53.411
I was just looking for Bárbara.

15:55.372 --> 15:56.247
Leo!

16:00.293 --> 16:02.212
Relax. We are okay.

16:02.837 --> 16:03.922
Trust me.

16:10.136 --> 16:11.971
Look at me. It's okay.

16:13.181 --> 16:14.307
Relax, okay?

16:19.771 --> 16:20.772
It's okay.

16:31.991 --> 16:32.867
Óscar?

16:33.034 --> 16:34.828
- Gaby.
- I thought you weren't coming.

16:35.370 --> 16:36.538
How's it going, Gaby?

16:36.830 --> 16:38.748
Your mask is so sexy.

16:39.332 --> 16:40.417
Well...

16:41.000 --> 16:42.752
How did you know it was me?

16:43.920 --> 16:45.004
You're a fool.

16:54.723 --> 16:57.684
- I'm looking for Adriana.
- Haven't you seen Valentín?

16:58.268 --> 16:59.978
Yes. I saw Valentín.

17:00.478 --> 17:02.021
- I've just seen him.
- Where?

17:02.397 --> 17:03.815
He went that way.

17:08.987 --> 17:12.115
You know I'd love to keep doing this.

17:12.574 --> 17:14.284
- Right?
- I know. But...

17:14.659 --> 17:16.619
- You need to find Adriana.
- Yes.

17:17.412 --> 17:18.830
And you need Valentín.

17:19.205 --> 17:20.206
Come here.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.719
- Good luck.
- You too.

17:34.304 --> 17:37.265
I thought revenge
would make me feel better.

17:37.891 --> 17:40.935
And I mean no offense.
You are...

17:41.770 --> 17:43.104
so hot.

17:44.314 --> 17:45.565
It's just...

17:45.648 --> 17:48.151
I can't get fucking Leo off my mind.

17:50.278 --> 17:53.406
I've worked so hard
to get where I am now.

17:53.990 --> 17:55.617
But he ruined everything.

17:55.950 --> 17:58.036
You're very upset.
But it's not your fault.

17:58.161 --> 18:00.789
He feels threatened by your success.

18:01.664 --> 18:02.707
Right?

18:03.124 --> 18:07.337
He always made me feel like his job
was more important than mine.

18:08.379 --> 18:11.883
Men of your generation are beasts.

18:12.258 --> 18:14.344
They claim for self-sufficient women.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.346
And when they find her,
they freak out.

18:16.471 --> 18:18.389
You'd be better on your own.

18:18.973 --> 18:22.227
Rather than with a man
who controls you constantly.

18:22.310 --> 18:23.436
That sucks.

18:24.646 --> 18:27.065
You can start from scratch.

18:28.191 --> 18:29.818
You are right.

18:29.859 --> 18:32.237
Yes. That's what I'm going to do.

18:34.489 --> 18:36.115
I'll start...

18:37.158 --> 18:38.409
from scratch.

18:40.995 --> 18:44.874
- And how do I do that?
- You can start with us, babe.

18:45.291 --> 18:47.210
Shall we start counting?

18:47.252 --> 18:48.378
Zero...

18:48.753 --> 18:49.629
One...

18:49.754 --> 18:51.047
Two...

18:51.339 --> 18:52.465
Three...

19:06.187 --> 19:07.230
Gaby!

19:07.313 --> 19:09.482
- Leo, you're here too?
- I am.

19:09.732 --> 19:11.067
Where's Bárbara?

19:11.317 --> 19:14.028
I'm not going tell you.
Not after what you've done to her.

19:14.153 --> 19:17.323
Please, I'm here to make amends.

19:17.615 --> 19:20.326
- Gaby, please.
- She's in room seven.

19:21.786 --> 19:23.997
- And what are you doing here?
- I'm looking for Valentín.

19:24.497 --> 19:27.542
What is the point of the game
if you have sex with your husband?

19:27.709 --> 19:29.919
- Just enjoy.
- Have you seen him?

19:30.003 --> 19:31.296
- No.
- Leo?

19:31.880 --> 19:33.923
- No, I haven't seen him.
- Leo, tell me truth.

19:34.215 --> 19:35.425
I don't know!

21:08.518 --> 21:09.852
I'm a warrior!

21:10.103 --> 21:11.437
I'm a warrior!

21:11.646 --> 21:13.815
- I'm a warrior!
- Good!

21:14.148 --> 21:15.191
Bárbara?

21:15.525 --> 21:17.944
Leo! What are you doing here?

21:20.279 --> 21:21.990
Can we talk, please?

21:22.490 --> 21:23.491
- It's him?
- Yes.

21:23.574 --> 21:26.661
She doesn't want to talk to you.
Honor her for once.

21:26.661 --> 21:27.954
Listen, man.

21:28.413 --> 21:29.622
I fucked this up.

21:30.123 --> 21:32.458
I came to say I'm sorry,
and make amends.

21:34.585 --> 21:37.505
- How?
- Yes. Explain yourself.

21:40.133 --> 21:42.260
This is coming out in Monday's paper.

21:46.180 --> 21:49.517
This could help,
Aurelia might withdraw the lawsuit.

21:50.768 --> 21:51.769
But...

21:52.603 --> 21:54.814
How's that supposed
to save our relationship?

21:55.773 --> 21:58.776
I'm an idiot, Bárbara.
For putting you on the line.

21:58.901 --> 22:01.195
I know what you do
for me and the kids.

22:02.530 --> 22:03.823
I'm an asshole.

22:05.033 --> 22:06.826
For not appreciating you.

22:07.577 --> 22:08.911
At least he's admitting it.

22:09.954 --> 22:11.789
You're the best thing
that ever happened to me.

22:11.873 --> 22:14.834
Please, marry me, Bárbara.

22:22.717 --> 22:25.219
No. No.
I don't care about marrying you.

22:25.970 --> 22:28.890
I just wanted you
to choose me over your beliefs.

22:29.057 --> 22:31.184
To stop being so selfish, Leo.

22:32.810 --> 22:34.479
But you couldn't.

22:35.313 --> 22:36.606
I swear I'll change.

22:37.648 --> 22:39.317
But, please, marry me.

22:39.984 --> 22:41.986
I know you love weddings, Bárbara.

22:45.698 --> 22:47.075
I do love them.

22:49.285 --> 22:50.411
Maybe.

22:52.080 --> 22:53.331
It could be.

22:56.375 --> 22:59.295
Let's celebrate.

22:59.712 --> 23:01.380
Wait.

23:01.380 --> 23:03.925
I thought you said
you'd stop being selfish.

23:04.300 --> 23:06.594
- Don't be selfish.
- I know, babe. But...

23:06.677 --> 23:08.763
This is hard-core.

24:55.620 --> 24:57.205
Leave me alone, please.

25:00.666 --> 25:02.376
I thought I'd never find you.

25:05.963 --> 25:07.548
I had an awful night.

25:18.976 --> 25:20.770
I looked for you all night.

25:33.950 --> 25:35.910
They all look dead.

25:36.077 --> 25:37.912
I think they had a great time.

25:40.623 --> 25:43.834
Look. He's a profesor from college.

25:46.420 --> 25:49.924
- I had such a great time with you.
- It's just that we have chemistry.

25:51.968 --> 25:54.929
Oh, look.
It's your friend Óscar. Isn't he?

25:55.388 --> 25:56.430
Óscar?

25:56.973 --> 25:57.974
Óscar!

26:01.269 --> 26:02.395
Hey.

26:02.770 --> 26:05.731
- Is the party over yet?
- What are you doing here?

26:06.983 --> 26:08.484
I'm sorry I've crashed.

26:09.277 --> 26:12.405
I spent all night looking for
Adriana. Where is she?

26:13.864 --> 26:15.366
I'm sure she's with Sergio.

26:15.950 --> 26:17.034
Follow me.

26:17.368 --> 26:19.287
- They must be upstairs.
- Where?

26:24.709 --> 26:27.795
Maybe you guys should stop looking
for them.

26:31.465 --> 26:35.219
Cold, cold, cold.

26:36.220 --> 26:37.596
Hot!

26:38.097 --> 26:39.432
- Cold!
- Gala!

26:44.353 --> 26:45.479
Hot!

27:04.206 --> 27:06.167
You fucking disgust me.

27:13.257 --> 27:15.009
Be careful what you wish for.

27:30.483 --> 27:32.068
Let's get out of here, Adriana.

27:32.443 --> 27:34.862
This game is out of control.
I don't care what you did with him.

27:35.613 --> 27:37.031
I know you love me.

27:38.491 --> 27:40.785
Don't throw all these years away.

27:45.581 --> 27:46.499
Adriana?

28:46.642 --> 28:50.187
I can't fucking believe it.
