00:14.681 --> 00:16.975

00:17.058 --> 00:18.268
WHAT IS ALL THIS?

00:18.351 --> 00:20.812
- WHO ARE ALL THESE PEOPLE?

00:20.895 --> 00:22.272
WHERE IS MELANIE?

00:22.355 --> 00:23.606

00:24.566 --> 00:27.569

00:27.652 --> 00:28.611
[screams]

00:28.695 --> 00:29.988
YOUR HAIR!

00:30.071 --> 00:31.072
- WE'VE ALREADY SCREAMED
ABOUT THE HAIR.

00:31.156 --> 00:32.073
ARE YOU OKAY?

00:32.156 --> 00:33.450
- HOW CAN I BE OKAY?

00:33.533 --> 00:35.410
I'M "DUCK-TAPED" TO A WALL!

00:35.493 --> 00:37.787
- IT'S DUCT-TAPED,
WITH A "T."

00:37.871 --> 00:40.206
AND I KNOW THIS BECAUSE I PLAYED
A PLUCKY PLUMBER'S WIFE

00:40.290 --> 00:41.207
IN THE LIFETIME
ORIGINAL MOVIE--

00:41.291 --> 00:42.959
- SERIOUSLY? NOW?

00:43.042 --> 00:46.087
- HOW DID ALL THIS HAPPEN?

00:50.383 --> 00:51.676
[doorbell rings]
- WHO'S THAT?

00:51.760 --> 00:53.094
- THE STRIPPER'S HERE.

00:53.178 --> 00:55.930
- YEA!

00:56.014 --> 00:56.973
- AFTERNOON, MA'AM.

00:57.056 --> 00:57.974
- OH, NO.

00:58.057 --> 01:00.310
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

01:00.393 --> 01:01.519
- UH, LOOK,

01:01.603 --> 01:03.521
YOUR CAR IS PARKED
TOO FAR FROM THE CURB.

01:03.605 --> 01:05.147
I'M GONNA LET YOU OFF
WITH A WARNING, BUT--

01:05.230 --> 01:06.357
- ALL RIGHT,
ENOUGH WITH THE PATTER.

01:06.441 --> 01:09.360
COME ON IN AND SHOW ME
WHAT YOU GOT.

01:09.444 --> 01:10.195
- EXCUSE ME?

01:10.278 --> 01:12.280
- LOOK, I HAVE 20 WOMEN
COMING HERE

01:12.363 --> 01:15.033
EXPECTING TO SEE A G-MAN
IN A G-STRING.

01:15.116 --> 01:18.661
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
YOU'RE PACKING MUCH HEAT.

01:18.745 --> 01:22.290
- STRIPPER'S HERE.

01:25.752 --> 01:28.755
WE'RE GONNA GO
GRATE SOME CHEESE ON HIS ABS.

01:35.053 --> 01:38.348
- I'LL JUST TAKE
THAT TICKET NOW.

01:38.431 --> 01:40.809
- WELL, SEEING THAT
YOU'RE A LOCAL CELEBRITY--

01:40.892 --> 01:42.852
- LOCAL?

01:42.936 --> 01:44.521
- I'VE SEEN YOU ON THE NEWS.

01:44.604 --> 01:49.484
ANYWAY, MAKE SURE
YOU MOVE THAT CAR.

01:49.567 --> 01:51.152
AND BY THE WAY,

01:51.236 --> 01:52.904
THESE PANTS ARE DECEIVING.

01:52.987 --> 01:55.782
I'M PACKING PLENTY.

01:59.494 --> 02:00.662
- WHERE'S THE STRIPPER?

02:00.745 --> 02:01.704
- OH, IT WASN'T A STRIPPER.

02:01.788 --> 02:03.331
IT WAS A REAL COP.

02:03.414 --> 02:04.499
AND HE LET ME OFF
WITH A WARNING

02:04.582 --> 02:06.000
BECAUSE I'M
A "LOCAL" CELEBRITY.

02:06.084 --> 02:07.377
- WELL, THAT'S NICE.
- NO, IT'S NOT.

02:07.460 --> 02:10.088
I'M A NATIONAL CELEBRITY.

02:10.170 --> 02:11.339
I MEAN, IT'S ONE THING
TO OWN CLEVELAND,

02:11.422 --> 02:13.716
BUT TO BE CLEVELAND'S OWN--

02:13.800 --> 02:16.386
DEAR GOD, I NEED A DRINK.

02:16.469 --> 02:17.387
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.055
AS MAID OF HONOR,

02:19.138 --> 02:20.723
IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY
TO MAKE SURE

02:20.807 --> 02:22.392
THAT NO ONE HAS A HANGOVER
AT ELKA'S WEDDING TOMORROW.

02:22.475 --> 02:24.018
- IT'S A BACHELORETTE PARTY.

02:24.102 --> 02:25.854
WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO DRINK HEAVILY.

02:25.937 --> 02:28.064
I KNOW BECAUSE
I'VE BEEN A BRIDESMAID

02:28.147 --> 02:31.067
SO MANY, MANY TIMES.

02:31.150 --> 02:32.527
- WE CAN DRINK,
BUT I READ ON THE INTERNET

02:32.610 --> 02:34.028
IF YOU TAKE LOTS OF ASPIRIN
AND DRINK WATER,

02:34.112 --> 02:35.613
YOU WON'T GET A HANGOVER.

02:35.697 --> 02:38.449
- YOU KNOW, YOU CAN'T BELIEVE
EVERYTHING YOU READ ONLINE.

02:38.533 --> 02:40.577
- IT ALSO SAID
YOU NEED TO COAT YOUR STOMACH

02:40.660 --> 02:41.703
WITH CARBS.

02:41.786 --> 02:43.079
- AH, ON THE OTHER HAND,

02:43.162 --> 02:45.415
THE INTERNET IS
A KIND OF FOLK WISDOM.

02:45.498 --> 02:47.250
- AND WE DON'T WANT TO RUIN
ELKA'S BIG DAY.

02:47.333 --> 02:48.585
- NO.

02:48.668 --> 02:49.961
- AND THAT'S THE LAST THING
I REMEMBER.

02:50.044 --> 02:51.588
- ME TOO.

02:51.671 --> 02:53.631
- OKAY, SO BASICALLY,
THE ONLY THING WE KNOW FOR SURE

02:53.715 --> 02:58.094
IS THAT HAIRY-BELLIED YOUNG MEN
ENJOYED THEMSELVES.

02:58.177 --> 02:59.554
- BUT I NEED SOME MORE
OF THAT ASPIRIN.

02:59.637 --> 03:02.140
- OH.

03:02.223 --> 03:03.683
- MELANIE...

03:03.766 --> 03:05.059
THIS ISN'T ASPIRIN.

03:05.143 --> 03:06.561
IT'S THE DOG'S WORM MEDICINE.

03:06.644 --> 03:08.271
- WHAT?

03:08.354 --> 03:09.606
- YOU DOSED US
WITH DOG DRUGS?

03:09.689 --> 03:10.773
- WELL, NOT ON PURPOSE!

03:10.857 --> 03:12.150
IT LOOKS JUST LIKE
THE ASPIRIN BOTTLE.

03:12.233 --> 03:13.818
- "IF INGESTED BY HUMANS,

03:13.902 --> 03:16.779
"COULD RESULT
IN EXTREME ERRATIC BEHAVIOR,

03:16.863 --> 03:18.114
ANXIETY, DELUSIONS,
DEPRESSION--"

03:18.197 --> 03:19.115
both:
[gasping, groaning]

03:19.198 --> 03:20.199
- "AND SUDDEN WEIGHT LOSS."

03:20.283 --> 03:22.118
- OH!
- OH, REALLY?

03:22.201 --> 03:24.579
I COULD LOSE A POUND
OR TWO.

03:24.662 --> 03:26.372
- I'M SURE WHATEVER WEIGHT
WE LOST WAS OFFSET

03:26.456 --> 03:28.541
BY THE GALLONS
OF CHAMPAGNE WE DRANK.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.793
- AND MAPLE SYRUP?

03:30.877 --> 03:32.670
- MAPLE SYRUP!

03:32.754 --> 03:34.422
I JUST REMEMBERED SOMETHING.

03:34.505 --> 03:36.341
I KISSED A MAN THAT SMELLED
LIKE MAPLE SYRUP.

03:36.424 --> 03:37.675
BUT WHICH ONE WAS IT?

03:37.759 --> 03:38.968
[sniffs]

03:39.052 --> 03:41.137
JAGERMEISTER.

03:41.220 --> 03:42.263
[sniffs]

03:42.347 --> 03:44.807
GOLDSCHLAGER.

03:44.891 --> 03:45.934
[sniffs]

03:46.017 --> 03:47.477
OOF.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.854
A GENERAL MATTHEW MCCONAUGHEY
KIND OF FUNK.

03:49.938 --> 03:51.147
- WAIT!

03:51.230 --> 03:52.941
NO, I-I REMEMBER
MAPLE SYRUP GUY.

03:53.024 --> 03:54.817
NO, HE, UH,
HE HAD A MUSTACHE

03:54.901 --> 03:55.944
AND A-A FUNNY ACCENT,

03:56.027 --> 03:56.945
AND I KISSED HIM AFTER YOU.

03:57.028 --> 03:58.529
- DAMN!

03:58.613 --> 04:00.615
EVEN DURING CONFUSING
ANIMAL MEDICINE BLACKOUTS,

04:00.698 --> 04:02.659
I CAN'T KEEP A MAN.

04:02.742 --> 04:04.494
- GUYS, WE CAN FIGURE OUT
WHAT WE DID LATER.

04:04.577 --> 04:05.495
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE TO GET

04:05.578 --> 04:06.663
ALL THESE PEOPLE
OUT OF HERE

04:06.746 --> 04:08.331
AND GET READY
FOR ELKA'S WEDDING.

04:08.414 --> 04:11.000
[whimpering]
I'M A TERRIBLE MAID OF HONOR.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.210
- OH, GOD.

04:12.293 --> 04:15.213
I'VE JUST NOTICED I'M--

04:15.296 --> 04:17.298
I'M WEARING A WEDDING RING.

04:17.382 --> 04:18.423
DID I GET MARRIED LAST NIGHT?

04:18.507 --> 04:19.634
- WE DON'T KNOW.

04:19.716 --> 04:21.135
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE DID
LAST NIGHT.

04:21.219 --> 04:23.513
- IT MUST HAVE BEEN
THE FUNNY-ACCENTED MAN

04:23.596 --> 04:25.682
WITH THE MAPLE SYRUP MUSTACHE.

04:25.765 --> 04:28.267
NOT THE MOST PROMISING PROFILE,
BUT AT LEAST HE'S MINE.

04:28.351 --> 04:29.310
- NOT SO FAST.

04:29.394 --> 04:32.105
APPARENTLY,
I GOT MARRIED TOO.

04:42.615 --> 04:44.158
{\an8}- COME ON, GO ON.
YEAH, GET OUTTA HERE.

04:44.242 --> 04:45.535
{\an8}RIGHT, YEAH.

04:45.618 --> 04:46.869
{\an8}- WHY ARE YOU GIVING THEM
GIFT BAGS?

04:46.953 --> 04:48.705
{\an8}- WELL, I'M STILL THE HOSTESS.

04:48.788 --> 04:50.206
{\an8}- MASCARA?

04:50.289 --> 04:51.708
{\an8}DON'T YOU HAVE SOMETHING
FOR GUYS?

04:51.791 --> 04:56.546
{\an8}- YOU WEREN'T EVEN SUPPOSED
TO BE HERE.

04:56.629 --> 04:58.089
{\an8}ANYWAY, IT'S L'OREAL
MILLION LASHES.

04:58.172 --> 04:59.549
{\an8}YOU SHOULD JUST GIVE IT
TO YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

04:59.632 --> 05:04.012
{\an8}- OH, COOL, THEN.
HERE.

05:04.095 --> 05:05.680
{\an8}- WHY ME?

05:05.763 --> 05:07.056
{\an8}- DUDE, WE TOTALLY
MADE OUT LAST NIGHT

05:07.140 --> 05:09.225
{\an8}FOR, LIKE, THREE HOURS.

05:09.308 --> 05:12.353
{\an8}CHECK MY FACEBOOK PAGE.

05:14.981 --> 05:16.190
{\an8}- THANKS.

05:16.274 --> 05:18.443
{\an8}- LADIES, UH,
WE HAVE A LITTLE PROBLEM.

05:18.526 --> 05:19.861
{\an8}I CAN'T FIND ELKA.

05:19.944 --> 05:21.446
{\an8}SHE'S NOT IN HER COTTAGE,

05:21.529 --> 05:23.239
{\an8}SHE MISSED
HER HAIRDRESSER'S APPOINTMENT,

05:23.322 --> 05:24.532
{\an8}AND SHE'S NOT ANSWERING
HER CELL.

05:24.615 --> 05:25.700
{\an8}- SHE'S GETTING MARRIED
IN THREE HOURS.

05:25.783 --> 05:27.076
{\an8}OH, M--
THIS IS A DISASTER!

05:27.160 --> 05:28.077
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT,
LET'S NOT GO

05:28.161 --> 05:29.579
{\an8}TO FULL-OUT PANIC
JUST YET.

05:29.662 --> 05:31.914
{\an8}[doorbell rings]
I'M SURE SHE'S WITH FRED.

05:31.998 --> 05:35.626
{\an8}OH, NO, IT'S FRED.

05:35.710 --> 05:37.754
{\an8}UH, LOOK, YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED
TO SEE THE BRIDE.

05:37.837 --> 05:39.255
{\an8}UNLESS, OF COURSE,
ELKA CALLED OR EMAILED YOU

05:39.338 --> 05:40.590
{\an8}AND ASKED YOU TO COME OVER.

05:40.673 --> 05:42.425
{\an8}DID SHE DO THAT?

05:42.508 --> 05:43.885
{\an8}- NO, I HAVEN'T TALKED
TO ELKA

05:43.968 --> 05:45.595
{\an8}SINCE SHE WAS GETTING READY
TO COME TO YOUR PARTY.

05:45.678 --> 05:47.055
{\an8}- AH.
- OOH!

05:47.138 --> 05:49.432
{\an8}SOME PARTY!

05:49.515 --> 05:52.477
{\an8}MY BACHELOR PARTY
GOT A LITTLE WILD TOO.

05:52.560 --> 05:55.605
{\an8}CAFFEINATED SODAS
AFTER 10:00.

05:55.688 --> 05:57.065
{\an8}[chuckles]

05:57.148 --> 05:58.274
{\an8}STILL FEELING IT.

05:58.357 --> 06:00.276
{\an8}- IT'S A GREAT STORY, FRED.

06:00.359 --> 06:01.569
{\an8}WELL, NICE TO SEE YOU.

06:01.652 --> 06:02.737
{\an8}- OH, OH, OH, OH, OH.

06:02.820 --> 06:05.406
{\an8}I NEED YOU GUYS TO FIND
MY LUCKY SHORTS.

06:05.490 --> 06:07.492
{\an8}I LEFT THEM
IN ELKA'S BEDROOM.

06:07.575 --> 06:09.118
{\an8}- WHAT'S SO LUCKY ABOUT THEM?

06:09.202 --> 06:11.621
{\an8}- WELL, THE FACT THAT
THEY'RE IN ELKA'S BEDROOM...

06:11.704 --> 06:13.164
{\an8}WOULD HAVE--

06:13.247 --> 06:14.457
{\an8}- OKAY, WE WILL FIND THEM,

06:14.540 --> 06:16.292
{\an8}AND WE WILL GET THEM
TO YOU.

06:16.375 --> 06:19.128
{\an8}- BLACK BOXER BRIEFS.

{\an8}UH, LOW-RISE.

06:21.380 --> 06:24.300
{\an8}MESH SIDE PANELS.

06:24.383 --> 06:26.135
- YOU PAINT A VIVID PICTURE.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.970
- OH, AND WHEN YOU TALK
TO ELKA,

06:28.054 --> 06:31.265
WILL YOU PLEASE TELL HER
THAT EVERY HOUR WE'RE APART,

06:31.349 --> 06:33.768
MY HEART BECOMES
A LITTLE SMALLER.

06:33.851 --> 06:35.645
- AWWW.

06:35.728 --> 06:37.146
- AND IT'S NOT GOOD
FOR MY HEART,

06:37.230 --> 06:40.483
SO TELL HER
TO CALL ME ALREADY.

06:40.566 --> 06:42.318
- CAN WE FULL-ON PANIC NOW?

06:42.401 --> 06:43.820
- IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

06:43.903 --> 06:45.363
THERE'S NO SIGN
OF HER ANYWHERE?

06:45.446 --> 06:47.323
- SIGN! ELKA WAS LOOKING
FOR A SIGN.

06:47.406 --> 06:48.825
WE TALKED ABOUT IT LAST NIGHT.

06:48.908 --> 06:52.161
I REMEMBER BEING
VERY INTERESTING AND WITTY.

06:52.245 --> 06:56.499
WAZZUUUUUUUP?

06:56.582 --> 07:01.379
- YOU'RE LOADED,
THAT'S WAZZUUUUUUUP.

07:01.462 --> 07:04.048
- BUT I'M NOT GONNA GET
A HANGOVER

07:04.132 --> 07:08.219
BECAUSE I TOOK LOTS AND LOTS
OF ASPIRIN.

07:08.302 --> 07:09.846
WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE?

07:09.929 --> 07:12.348
WEREN'T YOU HAVING FUN
AT YOUR PARTY?

07:12.431 --> 07:15.726
- I WAS,
BUT IT'S ALMOST MIDNIGHT,

07:15.810 --> 07:17.687
AND I HAVEN'T GOTTEN
MY SIGN YET.

07:17.770 --> 07:18.896
- YOUR SIGN?

07:18.980 --> 07:21.691
- FROM MY LATE HUSBAND, BOBBY.

07:21.774 --> 07:24.235
SO I'LL KNOW IF HE'S OKAY
WITH MY MARRYING FRED.

07:24.318 --> 07:27.363
[owl hoots]

07:30.992 --> 07:32.702
AN OWL.

07:32.785 --> 07:34.871
- WAS THAT THE SIGN?

07:34.954 --> 07:37.248
- IT MIGHT BE.

07:37.331 --> 07:39.709
BOBBY ALWAYS LIKED
THOSE POTATO CHIPS

07:39.792 --> 07:42.879
WITH THE OWL ON THEM.

07:42.962 --> 07:43.921

07:54.682 --> 07:57.018
I'LL CLIMB UP

07:57.101 --> 07:58.019
IF YOU GET MARRIED.

07:58.102 --> 07:59.520
- NO, YOU'RE TOO DRUNK.

07:59.604 --> 08:04.400
- NO, I'M JUST DRUNK ENOUGH.

08:04.483 --> 08:06.569

AND ALIVE AND ENERGIZED
AND ALIVE!

08:13.326 --> 08:14.744
AND DID I SAY ALIVE?

08:14.827 --> 08:17.914
I MEANT TO SAY IT TWICE
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW ALIVE I FEEL.

08:17.997 --> 08:19.415
- I FEEL WEIRD.

08:19.498 --> 08:20.750
MAYBE WE SHOULD STOP DRINKING.

08:20.833 --> 08:22.460
- NO, THAT'S QUITTER TALK.

08:22.543 --> 08:24.086
YOU NEED TO BE STRONG
IN THE FACE OF YOUR EMOTIONS

08:24.170 --> 08:25.671
BECAUSE I'VE NOTICED
YOUR EMOTIONS

08:25.755 --> 08:27.423
CAN SENSE YOUR MOODS,
AND THEN WHEN YOU'RE SAD,

08:27.506 --> 08:28.925
THEY'RE HAPPY
BECAUSE THEY WANT--

08:29.008 --> 08:30.384
AND CAN YOU BELIEVE ELKA
IS GETTING MARRIED

08:30.468 --> 08:34.263
BEFORE I AM?

08:34.347 --> 08:38.308
- LLLLOCAL CELEBRITY.

08:38.392 --> 08:40.269
AH, THAT'S HOW IT STARTS.

08:40.352 --> 08:42.438
OR SHOULD I SAY FINISHES?

08:42.520 --> 08:44.607
SHE'S BEEN MARRIED BEFORE.
MELANIE'S BEEN MARRIED BEFORE.

08:44.690 --> 08:46.108
YOU'VE BEEN MARRIED
LIKE A MILLION TIMES.

08:46.192 --> 08:47.985
IT CAN'T BE THAT HARD.
I'M GONNA GET MARRIED TONIGHT.

08:48.069 --> 08:49.278
I KNOW, I'LL LOWER MY STANDARDS.

08:49.362 --> 08:52.782
BUT HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE?

08:52.865 --> 08:56.118
- THE FOUR STAGES
OF AN ACTOR'S LIFE.

08:56.202 --> 08:57.912
"GET ME VICTORIA CHASE.

08:57.995 --> 09:00.665
"NO, GET ME A VICTORIA CHASE
TYPE.

09:00.748 --> 09:03.501
"NO, GET ME
A YOUNG VICTORIA CHASE.

09:03.584 --> 09:07.964
[sobbing]
WHO'S VICTORIA CHASE?"

09:08.047 --> 09:09.757
- I'M SO GLAD WE'RE HAVING
THIS CONVERSATION

09:09.840 --> 09:11.676
BECAUSE I FEEL WE'RE CONNECTING
ON A DEEPER LEVEL.

09:11.759 --> 09:13.803
GOD, I FEEL SO ALIVE!

09:16.514 --> 09:18.808
- HOW'S THE OWL LOOK?

09:18.891 --> 09:21.811
- SCARY, LIKE WOLF BLITZER.

09:21.894 --> 09:25.481
OWL, IS IT OKAY
IF ELKA GETS MARRIED?

09:25.564 --> 09:27.483
- WHAT'S HE DOING?

09:27.567 --> 09:29.694
- STARING AT A GRAY SQUIRREL

09:29.777 --> 09:32.029
THAT LOOKS LIKE
ANDERSON COOPER.

09:32.113 --> 09:34.448
OH, WOLF BLITZER
IS CARRYING HIM AWAY.

09:34.532 --> 09:35.825
I'LL SAVE YOU, ANDERSON!

09:35.908 --> 09:40.329
WHOA--YAAAAH!
[thud]

09:40.413 --> 09:42.915
I'M OKAY.

09:50.256 --> 09:53.509
- I THINK THAT SQUIRREL
BIT MY ANKLE.

09:53.592 --> 09:55.845
OR MAYBE IT WAS
ONE OF THE FRAT BOYS.

09:55.928 --> 09:59.682
EITHER WAY, I'M GONNA NEED
A TETANUS SHOT.

09:59.765 --> 10:01.017
[gasps]
FRAT HOUSE.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.393
I REMEMBER.

10:02.476 --> 10:04.812
ELKA WAS LOOKING FOR HER SIGN
FROM HER HUSBAND,

10:04.895 --> 10:06.230
SO SHE WANTED TO GO
TO ALL THE PLACES

10:06.314 --> 10:07.315
WHERE THEY HAD MEMORIES.

10:07.398 --> 10:08.482
- THAT'S RIGHT.

10:08.566 --> 10:09.692
WE WENT TO THEIR FIRST
APARTMENT,

10:09.775 --> 10:11.652
WHICH IS NOW PART
OF A COLLEGE DORM.

10:11.736 --> 10:13.195
WHICH EXPLAINS THE FRAT BOYS

10:13.279 --> 10:14.905
ALL OVER THE FURNITURE
THIS MORNING

10:14.989 --> 10:19.201
AND WHY SOMEONE WROTE
KAPPA SIG ON MY BACK.

10:19.285 --> 10:20.453
- THE MUGS.

10:20.536 --> 10:21.996
- THE MUGS?

10:22.079 --> 10:25.207
WHO ARE YOU,
EDWARD G. ROBINSON?

10:25.291 --> 10:27.168
- THE MUGS OVER THE BAR.

10:27.251 --> 10:29.045
WE WENT THERE LAST NIGHT,
REMEMBER?

10:29.128 --> 10:31.172
- BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE
ELKA'S HUSBAND PROPOSED.

10:31.255 --> 10:33.090
HE SURPRISED HER
BY ARRANGING THE MUGS

10:33.174 --> 10:34.425
TO SPELL "MARRY ME."

10:34.508 --> 10:36.969
- AND WHAT DID THEY SPELL
LAST NIGHT?

10:39.472 --> 10:41.932
- OH, I HOPE ELKA
DIDN'T SEE THAT.

10:44.602 --> 10:45.853
- OH, HEY, YOU'RE BACK.

10:45.936 --> 10:47.521
- OH, THANK GOD YOU REMEMBER US.

10:47.605 --> 10:49.398
WE'RE DESPERATE TO FIND
OUR FRIEND ELKA.

10:49.482 --> 10:51.400
WAS SHE HERE WITH US
LAST NIGHT?

10:51.484 --> 10:53.194
- YEAH, SHE GOT UPSET AND LEFT
AFTER SHE SAW THESE MUGS.

10:53.277 --> 10:55.112
- WHY DO THEY SAY
"DON'T DO IT"?

10:55.196 --> 10:56.906
- IT WAS FOR THE PURITY PLEDGE
DINNER.

10:56.989 --> 10:59.200
YOU GUYS STAYED
AND TOOK THE OATH.

10:59.283 --> 11:00.576
- WE DID?

11:00.659 --> 11:03.537
- NOT YOU.
YOU WON A WET T-SHIRT CONTEST.

11:06.874 --> 11:09.293
- I ENTERED A WET T-SHIRT
CONTEST?

11:09.377 --> 11:12.213
- YOU STARTED IT.

11:12.296 --> 11:13.589
YOU CAME IN WEARING
A WET SHIRT

11:13.673 --> 11:15.174
AND CHALLENGED EVERYBODY.

11:15.257 --> 11:16.592
I BELIEVE
YOUR EXACT WORDS WERE,

11:16.675 --> 11:21.097
"NOBODY CAN BEAT THESE."

11:21.180 --> 11:22.223
- HOLY--

11:22.306 --> 11:24.100
OH!

11:24.183 --> 11:25.309
I REMEMBER
HOW I GOT WET.

11:25.393 --> 11:26.894
WE WERE IN CHURCH.

11:26.977 --> 11:28.896
- WAS IT MY WEDDING?
- OR MINE?

11:28.979 --> 11:30.106
- NO, IT'S THE CHURCH
THAT ELKA AND FRED

11:30.189 --> 11:31.232
ARE GONNA GET MARRIED AT.

11:31.315 --> 11:32.817
SHE WAS STILL LOOKING
FOR HER SIGN.

11:32.900 --> 11:34.652
- GOD DIDN'T GET MARRIED
EITHER, DID HE?

11:34.735 --> 11:36.278
I MEAN, THERE WAS NO MRS. GOD.

11:36.362 --> 11:37.988
WOULD SHE BE MRS. GOD?
NOT IF SHE KEPT HER MAIDEN NAME.

11:38.072 --> 11:39.073
BUT WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT?

11:39.156 --> 11:40.741
MRS. GOD!

11:40.825 --> 11:44.787
IT WOULD BE SO EASY
TO GET RESERVATIONS.

11:44.870 --> 11:46.288
GOD WAS ALONE.

11:46.372 --> 11:47.915
I FEEL HIS PAIN.

11:47.998 --> 11:49.959
THAT'S WHY WE'RE BOTH
SO VENGEFUL.

11:50.042 --> 11:51.961
I'M GONNA MARRY THE NEXT GUY
THAT'LL HAVE ME.

11:52.044 --> 11:54.088
- WHAT GUY WOULDN'T HAVE YOU?

11:54.171 --> 11:57.508
- WHAT GUY HASN'T HAD YOU?

11:57.591 --> 11:59.635
CAN WE GET BACK TO MY SIGN?

11:59.718 --> 12:02.638
BOBBY, PLEASE.
GIVE ME SOMETHING.

12:02.721 --> 12:04.765
- I KNOW WHAT WE CAN DO.

12:04.849 --> 12:07.309
YOU CAN OPEN THE BIBLE,
CLOSE YOUR EYES,

12:07.393 --> 12:08.811
AND THEN PUT YOUR FINGER
ON A PASSAGE

12:08.894 --> 12:09.937
AND SEE WHAT IT SAYS.

12:10.020 --> 12:12.648
- OH, LIKE GOD'S MAGIC 8 BALL.

12:12.731 --> 12:14.316
SIGNS POINT TO YES.
OUTLOOK CLOUDY.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.026
YOU'RE GOING ON A LONG TRIP.
AGH!

12:16.110 --> 12:18.362
THAT'S A FORTUNE COOKIE.

12:18.446 --> 12:19.655
- I CAN'T LOOK.

12:19.738 --> 12:25.077
- I SHALL DO THE READING
OF THE WORD.

12:25.161 --> 12:27.830
UH, "THOSE WHO MARRY
WILL FACE MANY TROUBLES

12:27.913 --> 12:28.998
IN THIS LIFE."

12:29.081 --> 12:31.000
- OH, NO.

12:31.083 --> 12:33.586
- UH, HOW 'BOUT BEST TWOETH
OUT OF THREETH?

12:37.006 --> 12:38.674
"THE LORD HAS PREPARED
HIS PEOPLE

12:38.757 --> 12:41.177
FOR A GREAT SLAUGHTER."

12:41.260 --> 12:44.013
AND, UH,

12:44.096 --> 12:46.974
MAY THE OLDEST AND MOST
BEDAZZLED AMONGST YOU

12:47.057 --> 12:50.478
NAY, SWEATETH NOT,
BUT JUST GO FOR IT.

12:50.561 --> 12:52.354
- YOU MADE THAT UP.

12:52.438 --> 12:54.774
YOU JUST BLASPHEMED.

12:54.857 --> 12:57.651
BLAS--
BLASPHEME--BLA--

12:57.735 --> 12:59.737
YOU DID A BAD THING.

12:59.820 --> 13:01.739
- WHAT ARE YOU EATING?

13:01.822 --> 13:03.532
- OH, I FOUND THESE CRACKERS

13:03.616 --> 13:05.034
WITH THESE CUTE LITTLE Ts
ON THEM.

13:05.117 --> 13:06.702
- THOSE ARE CROSSES.

13:06.785 --> 13:10.206
YOU'RE EATING
THE COMMUNION WAFERS.

13:10.289 --> 13:11.207
- OH, NO.

13:11.290 --> 13:12.666
OH, NO.

13:12.750 --> 13:15.503
I'M GONNA GO
STRAIGHT TO HE--

13:18.506 --> 13:20.132
HELP.

13:25.137 --> 13:26.931
- SO HIGH ON DOG MEDICINE,

13:27.014 --> 13:29.058
I ATE A BOX
OF COMMUNION WAFERS

13:29.141 --> 13:31.936
AND WON A WET T-SHIRT CONTEST
DRENCHED IN HOLY WATER.

13:36.524 --> 13:38.275
HOW MANY SINS IS THAT?

13:38.359 --> 13:40.027
- WELL--

13:40.110 --> 13:42.238
WELL, AT LEAST THE WAFERS
HADN'T BEEN BLESSED YET.

13:42.321 --> 13:43.614
- HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

13:43.697 --> 13:45.366
- DON'T YOU REMEMBER
ON <i> EDGE OF TOMORROW,</i>

13:45.449 --> 13:46.742
WHEN HONOR ST. RAVEN
BECAME A NUN

13:46.825 --> 13:48.077
AND TOOK A VOW OF SILENCE?

13:48.160 --> 13:50.955
YOU KNOW, I DID ALL MY ACTING
WITH MY EYES.

14:03.676 --> 14:06.345
- HEY.
WEIRD QUESTION.

14:06.428 --> 14:07.596
DID YOU TAKE MY IGUANA?

14:07.680 --> 14:09.682
- THE IGUANA'S AT OUR HOUSE.

14:09.765 --> 14:11.559
WE'LL BRING IT BACK
AFTER THE WEDDING.

14:11.642 --> 14:14.395
IF THERE IS A WEDDING.

14:18.190 --> 14:19.608
(both)
- PANCAKES.

14:19.692 --> 14:20.776
- THE THING ABOUT PANCAKES

14:20.859 --> 14:22.486
IS THEY'RE ALSO CALLED HOTCAKES

14:22.570 --> 14:24.405
AND SOMETIMES JOHNNY CAKES,
AND YET ALL OF THESE CAKES,

14:24.488 --> 14:26.115
NONE OF THEM HAS FROSTING,
WHICH, BY THE WAY,

14:26.198 --> 14:27.116
THEY OUGHT TO SELL
IN SINGLE SERVINGS.

14:27.199 --> 14:29.493
SINGLE-SERVING FROSTING!

14:29.577 --> 14:30.661
THAT'S A MILLION-DOLLAR IDEA!

14:30.744 --> 14:34.164
WE NEED TO BECOME MAN-TRAPS.

14:34.248 --> 14:35.708
- I HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT
TO MAKE.

14:35.791 --> 14:38.252
I AM GONNA GET FAT.

14:38.335 --> 14:39.837
I DON'T KNOW,
IT SEEMS THAT PEOPLE LIKE

14:39.920 --> 14:42.798
THEIR LOCAL CELEBRITIES JOLLY.

14:42.881 --> 14:46.260
AND ALSO,
THESE THINGS ARE AWESOME.

14:46.343 --> 14:47.511

EATEN ONE

14:47.595 --> 14:49.471

14:49.555 --> 14:52.891
OH, UH, BARKEEP?

14:52.975 --> 14:54.143
WE NEED SOME MORE
MAPLE SYRUP, PLEASE.

14:54.226 --> 14:57.646
- SORRY, YOU DRANK
THE LAST BOTTLE.

14:57.730 --> 15:00.482
- EVERYTHING IS RUINED.

15:00.566 --> 15:02.109
- VICTORIA, VICTORIA, VICTORIA.

15:02.192 --> 15:04.236
SYRUP IS THE FROSTING
OF PANCAKES.

15:04.320 --> 15:05.988
WHICH IS WHY WE NEED
TO GET MORE.

15:06.071 --> 15:08.240
- WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
GO TO CANADA?

15:08.324 --> 15:10.326

WE SHOULD DO.

15:12.369 --> 15:14.330
CANADA IS THE CRAZY THING

15:23.047 --> 15:24.840
- YOU GUYS FLEW TO CANADA?

15:24.923 --> 15:26.383
- WE DID.

15:26.467 --> 15:27.676
WE TALKED OUR WAY
ONTO A CHARTER JET

15:27.760 --> 15:29.178
FULL OF BIG-HAIRED WOMEN.

15:29.261 --> 15:32.348
- IT WAS THE ROAD COMPANY
OF <i> HAIRSPRAY.</i>

15:32.431 --> 15:34.725
SO MAYBE OUR HUSBANDS
ARE IN MUSICAL THEATER.

15:34.808 --> 15:36.018
- OUR HUSBANDS ARE GAY?

15:36.101 --> 15:37.478
- WELL, IT ISN'T SO BAD.

15:37.561 --> 15:39.313

IN THE BEDROOM,

15:39.396 --> 15:41.315

IS SPECTACULAR.

15:41.398 --> 15:42.650

15:45.611 --> 15:47.029

15:52.618 --> 15:54.411
- WHAT ABOUT THE LAST PLACE
THEY WERE TOGETHER?

HAVE TO BE LIGHTNING,

YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT?

17:21.205 --> 17:23.125
IF WE'RE GONNA BE MARRIED,
WE CAN'T BE SNARKY.
