WEBVTT

00:09.000 --> 00:12.000
I love you, Mommy.

00:15.000 --> 00:17.000
MAN: This is our target --
the nuclear power plant.

00:17.000 --> 00:21.000
If we capture the plane
at precisely the right moment,

00:21.000 --> 00:23.000
they will not have time
to shoot down the aircraft.

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
MAN:
If they hit that power plant

00:26.000 --> 00:28.000
with that aircraft,

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
the casualties could be
in the hundreds of thousands.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.000
God help us all.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
Okay. Ready?

00:36.000 --> 00:38.000
ANNOUNCER:  ...except...

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
What? What is this CPT?

00:42.000 --> 00:43.000
None for me,
thanks.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
WOMAN:
That means the plane is gonna

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
get here when it gets here.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.000
Tom, I think you can have

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
a second glass
on your anniversary.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.000
I'm driving, sweetie-pooh.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
ANNOUNCER: They picked the wrong airline.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.000
Heh. I don't think
one more glass

00:49.000 --> 00:50.000
And don't come up here
complaining and shit.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.000
of wine will kill you.

00:51.000 --> 00:52.000
You motherfuckers wanna
come on here

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
No, but driving under
the influence of alcohol

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
and act a goddamn fool?

00:53.000 --> 00:55.000
could kill me or you,
or somebody's baby.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
I'm about to go on break.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.000
You motherfucking terrorists
kill me.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.000
Worse yet,

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
I'd spend the next 20 years
in jail being--

00:58.000 --> 00:59.000
BOTH:
Anally raped.

00:59.000 --> 01:00.000
Yeah, let's talk more

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
ANNOUNCER:  Come see why black incompetence...

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
Hey, hey, shorty!

01:01.000 --> 01:02.000
about your violated rectum.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.000
Oh, I find it
so romantic.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
TOM: Hey, I'm just saying--

01:04.000 --> 01:05.000
Whoo, whoo!

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Goddamn, that bitch
phat as a motherfucker.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
So...

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
...is our funniest weapon in the war on terror.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
n-no wine, then?

01:09.000 --> 01:10.000
No, thank you.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.000
We can't let you through,
homey.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Hey, this is Osama bin Laden
nephew, nigga.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
Well, I-- I'm --
I'm once removed. I-I--

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
No --
I just fucking with you, dawg.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
Go ahead, nigga.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
ANNOUNCER: Starring Gary Anthony Williams.

01:20.000 --> 01:22.000
Oh, oh--
Oh, my gosh.

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
But you know what they say --
when it's your time to go,

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
it's your time to go. John Witherspoon.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
What if it's the motherfucker
next to me time to go? Huh?

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
Mo'Nique.
It's very important

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
TOM:
Ah. Now, that's what

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
I like to see.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
this plane leave on time.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.000
Damn. Now, are you yelling
at me or shitting at me?

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Snoop Dogg.
Hijacked?

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
Them niggas ain't getting
my wizzie fo' shizzle, nigga.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Oh, my. No, honey,
don't sing. Not again.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
You know what I'm saying? And 50 Cent

01:39.000 --> 01:41.000
A while for me?

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
as Air Marshal 50 Cent.

01:41.000 --> 01:43.000
SARAH: Um, Tom. Tom...

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
...people are looking.

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
I'll stop
those terrorists...

01:45.000 --> 01:46.000
Tom, please.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
or die trying.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.000
Honey. Honey, maybe this isn't
the best place to be singing--

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
Get ready. This time, it's going down.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
You can't go on

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
This is a hijacking.
Remain in your seats --

01:57.000 --> 01:59.000
Yay. All done.

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
No, this nigga
didn't.

01:59.000 --> 02:01.000
We have a bomb on the aircraft.

01:59.000 --> 02:03.000
Every time we come in.

02:02.000 --> 02:03.000
Everyone remain --

02:03.000 --> 02:04.000
Good.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
SARAH:
Yay.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.000
Ah! Oh, my God.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
What is it, honey?

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Wait. Is that Usher?

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
I'm about to go
get dressed.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.000
Yes! Oh, my God.

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
He's coming over.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.000
We gonna fly on the
Soul Plane!

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
I can't believe this.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
TOM:
Oh, sweetie,

02:21.000 --> 02:23.000
you hit the table.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.000
Hey, how you doin', babe?

02:24.000 --> 02:27.000
Hi, uh, uh, Mr. Usher.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
I-- I can't believe
it's you.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
I'm Sarah.

02:33.000 --> 02:35.000
You have a beautiful smile,
Sarah.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
A while for me?

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
SARAH:
I love this song.

02:46.000 --> 02:49.000
Oh, wonderful.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.000
Thank you very much.
Oh. Oh, God.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
Uh--

02:52.000 --> 02:53.000
That was beautiful.
It's just what I do.

02:53.000 --> 02:57.000
Oh, um, this is,
uh...Tom.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.000
Yes, I'm Tom. Just Tom.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
GRANDDAD:
Riley, hurry up.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
USHER:
Hey, how

03:00.000 --> 03:02.000
you doin'?

03:03.000 --> 03:05.000
SARAH:
You are so interesting.

03:05.000 --> 03:09.000
We gonna fly on
the  Soul Plane!

03:05.000 --> 03:08.000
USHER: You're interesting.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
If you don't
mind me asking,

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
And make sure you pee
before we leave.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
I ain't gonna miss my movie

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
where did you learn
to dance like that?

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
going to the bathroom
with you.

03:11.000 --> 03:14.000
I've never seen anyone dance
like Michael Jackson before.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
I'm gonna let you go in there
by yourself

03:14.000 --> 03:17.000
and get molested
by a nasty white man.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.000
Well, I've been dancing
for as long as I remember.

03:16.000 --> 03:19.000
It's not just the music.
I have seen all of your movies.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
What's wrong with you?

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
I don't wanna go to the movie.
Why not?

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
I don't ever wanna go
to the movies with you again.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Really? Even  Light It Up?

03:20.000 --> 03:22.000
I loved  Light It Up.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.000
Not after
what happened last time.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.000
I named my dog Light It Up.
Girl, please.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
What happened last time?

03:24.000 --> 03:27.000
We got arrested. And  shot at.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
My mama wouldn't
even see  Light It Up.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.000
So funny.
She's my manager.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Ah. Racism.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
I'm gonna talk to your mom.
She on MySpace.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
Daddy said I can go
to the movies,

03:29.000 --> 03:30.000
I'll call her.
Hee-hee-hee.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
but he said I'm not allowed
to see  Soul Plane.

03:30.000 --> 03:33.000
Are you a natural blond?
Oh. Oh, you are so funny.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
Good. You don't wanna go
to the movies with him.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Okay, one more.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
He's crazy.
Hush.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Please, we gotta get one more.
Look at that one.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.000
Can't see  Soul Plane?
Why, little baby?

03:38.000 --> 03:41.000
Because of the types
of stereos or something.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Let's go get
some fresh air.

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
It'd be good
for my vocals.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
Types of stereos?

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Sorry, man.
SARAH: I'm ticklish.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
Oh. No, no, no,
little baby doll.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
USHER:
I'm gonna

03:43.000 --> 03:44.000
tickle you again.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.000
Wouldn't let that shit
happen to me though.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
This is a good theater.
They have THX.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
USHER:
You rollin' with Ush.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
She means stereotypes.

03:51.000 --> 03:55.000
And this is where I put
the rabbit ears behind his head.

03:52.000 --> 03:55.000
Stereotypes? In  Soul Plane?
That's nonsense.

03:55.000 --> 03:57.000
Say, how about we tell
your daddy

03:55.000 --> 03:56.000
Ha-ha. See, honey?

03:56.000 --> 03:57.000
Yes, yes,
I see the ears.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.000
we saw something else, hm?

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
You mean...lie?

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
Don't you think
your behavior might have been

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
the slightest bit
inappropriate?

04:02.000 --> 04:03.000
That really doesn't seem to be
a good idea.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Hush, boy.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
Oh, stop being insecure.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
You know,

04:05.000 --> 04:07.000
it's okay to break
the rules

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
You were flirting.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.000
He asked me
to send him the pictures.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.000
every once
in a while.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
I won't tell
if you won't.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
Tom, you know
I'm a big Usher fan.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
Okay. Hee-hee.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.000
So is Jazmine,

04:11.000 --> 04:13.000
which make sense,
because she's 10.

04:12.000 --> 04:15.000
HUEY:  Sometimes I think Granddad may be a bad influence.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.000
What's that supposed to mean?

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
It means you're
a bit old to be acting

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
Hey, Riley. Don't forget
the camcorder.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
like some screaming TRL  groupie.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Now, the first  Soul Plane
was funny.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
Stop the car.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.000
Pfft. About as funny
as a lynching.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Now, now, we won't have
any of that. Just calm down.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Oh, hush, boy.
You ain't even see it.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
Stop the car!

04:24.000 --> 04:25.000
I never seen
a lynching, either,

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
but I know
they not funny.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
See? Shows what you know.
I've seen funny lynchings.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
No, you haven't.
I have so.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
Roscoe Patterson's lynching
was funny.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
Yeah, so them
niggas was like,

04:35.000 --> 04:37.000
"Roscoe, you better
leaves town

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
"before Mr. Charlie
and them crackers

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Uh, are you mad?

04:39.000 --> 04:41.000
gonna come for you."

04:41.000 --> 04:43.000
I'm like, "Man,
fuck them crackers, man.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
This is Roscoe Patterson."
Nigga, I don't give a fuck.

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
RILEY:
Usher?

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
I just don't
give a fuck.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
That nigga's my age.

04:47.000 --> 04:49.000
Know what I'm saying?
White man can eat a dick.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.000
So you guys don't think
I'm overreacting?

04:49.000 --> 04:51.000
Eat my balls,
nigga.

04:50.000 --> 04:52.000
I don't think so.

04:51.000 --> 04:53.000
MAN: There he is!
Get that nigger.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
You're a bigtime lawyer,

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
Uh-oh.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.000
and Sarah's acting all crazy
over an usher?

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Come on,
let's go!

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
Not an usher. Usher.
He's a singer.

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
MAN: Oh, shoot, he's fast!
Watch out!

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
It, uh, wasn't really
funny after that.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.000
Ushers ain't supposed
to sing.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.000
You can't hear
the movie.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.000
Mm-mm.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
This is gonna be so much fun.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.000
I finished cleaning
the storm drain for you, Robert.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
This  is going to be...

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
Oh. What's wrong?

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
...the worst day
of your life.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Tom's wife is cheating on him
with a singing usher.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.000
Oh, I didn't say
she was cheating.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
I'm bringing nunchucks.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.000
Lord, Lord, Lord.
How did you end up

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
Huh?

05:11.000 --> 05:13.000
with that white woman
anyway?

05:13.000 --> 05:15.000
I say toss her groupie ass
out the window

05:15.000 --> 05:17.000
and let that ho stargaze
from outside.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Now, Riley,
there's never a place

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
for violence
in a relationship.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
There sure seemed to be a place
at the restaurant last night.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
Here, put these coats on.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.000
She made you look like a bitch
in front of Usher.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
Huh?

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
Boy, watch
your mouth.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.000
Probably
started out charitable.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
GRANDDAD:
Here you go.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.000
She took you in, was probably
teachin' you how to read.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
What is it?

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
It's pinto beans
and neck bones.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.000
But, Granddad, she did make
Mr. DuBois look like a bitch.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
Now put this meat loaf
and gravy under your shirt.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
Why don't we just get treats
from the concession stand?

05:36.000 --> 05:38.000
Yeah. We know she made Tom
look like a bitch,

05:38.000 --> 05:39.000
but find a different way
to say it.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.000
Next thing you know,

05:40.000 --> 05:43.000
you rubbin' against
that silky white skin. Oh.

05:41.000 --> 05:44.000
You think I'm paying $20
for some popcorn?

05:43.000 --> 05:45.000
But I don't know
the non-curse way

05:44.000 --> 05:47.000
You must be out
of your damn mind.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.000
to say he got bitched.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Humiliated,
castrated, emasc--

05:47.000 --> 05:48.000
Are we allowed
to bring in food?

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Of course we're allowed to.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.000
Oh, all right, all right.
I get the point.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
It's my food, isn't it?
I paid for it.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.000
I mean, I can see
if it was a real nigga.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.000
That means I can eat it
when and where I want.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.000
If you lost
your ho to T.I.,

05:54.000 --> 05:57.000
I'd be like,
"Hey, that's T.I."

05:55.000 --> 05:57.000
Boy, put this pot roast in
your pants or you ain't eating.

05:57.000 --> 06:00.000
Oh, this is nothing.
He's just getting started.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.000
But Usher?

05:59.000 --> 06:00.000
You better check that ho,
Mr. DuBois.

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
You know what?
You guys are right.

06:02.000 --> 06:03.000
HUEY: Robert Jebediah Freeman

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
I'm gonna go back there
and put her in check.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.000
had sworn a lifetime intifada

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
against the movie theater industry

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
For example,
how many white women

06:06.000 --> 06:09.000
for exorbitant prices and poor customer service,

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
want to go to a basketball game
just to see the game,

06:09.000 --> 06:11.000
which, interestingly enough,

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
come back with one of them
NBA niggas out of sympathy?

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
did not stop him from going to see movies.

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
Okay, gang.
Keep your eyes open.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
She came to
see the game.

06:14.000 --> 06:17.000
She wanted to be
entertained.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Open for what?

06:16.000 --> 06:18.000
We're sneaking in.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.000
Oh, the white woman's
got a big heart.

06:18.000 --> 06:20.000
That's not true,
little baby.

06:20.000 --> 06:22.000
I bought my tickets online.
Scout's honor.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.000
Lord, she's got a big heart.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
Look. Granddad.

06:23.000 --> 06:26.000
I got some money saved.
The movie will be on me.

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Now, you put that away,
boy.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
These movie devils
ain't getting

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
any more of our money.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.000
Mm-mm.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
Uh...Mr. Freeman?

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
It says, "No outside food,"
little girl.

06:35.000 --> 06:39.000
Is your granddad home?

06:36.000 --> 06:38.000
That's why we keep it
inside our clothes.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.000
Are you sure
this is legal?

06:39.000 --> 06:42.000
Granddad.
Mr. DuBois' at the door.

06:41.000 --> 06:45.000
Okay, everybody, look alive now.
Here's our chance.

06:42.000 --> 06:45.000
You's a bitch.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.000
I understand
you need your job,

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
Well, Tom, I'm sorry
to hear about the split.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.000
but you're still
a human being with dignity.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.000
I would love to
let you crash,

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Yeah, I mean,
look at this uniform, man.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
but I just don't know
where you would stay.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.000
I look like
a fucking dork.

06:51.000 --> 06:53.000
Why would they make me dress
like this?

06:51.000 --> 06:52.000
Maybe the guest room.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.000
What did I do
to them, huh?

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
You should take action.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
Who told him about
the guest room?

06:56.000 --> 06:57.000
Ah. What can  I  do?

06:58.000 --> 07:00.000
Thank you so much,
Robert.

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
See, boys? See why

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
Have you ever thought about
forming a union?

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
I tell you marriage is bad?

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
What's a "union"?

07:03.000 --> 07:05.000
I don't care
what nobody say.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.000
MAN:
Hey, hey, hey! Hey!

07:05.000 --> 07:07.000
I ain't never
gettin' married.

07:06.000 --> 07:08.000
I paid.
I got my ticket.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.000
Yeah, yeah. I got
a ticket for you.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.000
A one-way ticket
to "Get the hell

07:10.000 --> 07:13.000
Statistically speakin',
it was bound to fail anyway.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.000
out of here, negro"
land.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Go on! Move it!

07:19.000 --> 07:20.000
Nigga, you gay.

07:20.000 --> 07:22.000
How about that?

07:21.000 --> 07:24.000
See it's burnin' me
to hold onto this.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.000
Another victory
of the common man

07:24.000 --> 07:25.000
over corporate greed.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.000
You're not advancing
any struggle

07:25.000 --> 07:29.000
I know this is something
I gotta do.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.000
by being cheap,
Granddad.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.000
I'll advance my belt
on your behind

07:30.000 --> 07:31.000
if you don't shut
your ass.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Oh, my God.

07:31.000 --> 07:33.000
Sarah--

07:33.000 --> 07:35.000
I didn't pay
to get in the movie.

07:34.000 --> 07:36.000
I love you

07:35.000 --> 07:37.000
Uh, yes, we did. I --
I ordered my tickets online.

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
It's just, I feel like this

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
Who got the neck bones?

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
No, you didn't.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.000
is coming to an end.

07:40.000 --> 07:41.000
We snuck in.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.000
We stole a movie.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.000
Now, who makes the rules?

07:45.000 --> 07:47.000
Grownups, right?

07:47.000 --> 07:49.000
And I'm grown up,
and I say it's okay.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.000
We're gonna
get caught.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.000
We're gonna
get caught.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.000
I should call my daddy
and turn myself in.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Oh, yeah?
You gonna tell him

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
To say this

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
what you came to see,  huh?

07:55.000 --> 07:57.000
From my heart

07:57.000 --> 07:59.000
I bet he'd like
to know that.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
Maybe  I  should make
a phone call.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.000
But we did fell apart

08:01.000 --> 08:02.000
No. Please, no.

08:02.000 --> 08:04.000
Good. Now just
calm down.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
Try some mashed potatoes.
Who got the popcorn?

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
I do, Granddad.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.000
Ow! Hey.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.000
What the hell is wrong
with you?

08:13.000 --> 08:15.000
What am I gonna do
with raw popcorn?

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
You're gonna ruin my dentures.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.000
Whew. Damn, can't watch
a movie without popcorn.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.000
Now I gotta spend
all my damn money

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
I gotta deal with

08:21.000 --> 08:22.000
on a bucket
of popcorn.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Told you.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
USHER:

08:28.000 --> 08:29.000
When your feeling

08:31.000 --> 08:33.000
You gotta let it go

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
Jumpin' like it used to

08:39.000 --> 08:42.000
Let it burn

08:44.000 --> 08:45.000
It's best

08:47.000 --> 08:50.000
Of her being with someone--

08:49.000 --> 08:51.000
Oh. Help me.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
MAN:
Car!

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
I'll give you anything. Ah!

09:00.000 --> 09:02.000
ANNOUNCER: Don't steal movies.

09:08.000 --> 09:10.000
Hello?

09:10.000 --> 09:11.000
SARAH: It's Sarah.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
GRANDDAD: Damn.

09:11.000 --> 09:13.000
How are you, baby?

09:13.000 --> 09:16.000
Large freshly popped popcorn,
please. And lots of butter.

09:13.000 --> 09:15.000
You're still taking Jazmine

09:15.000 --> 09:18.000
to her recital practice at 3, right?

09:17.000 --> 09:19.000
Anything else?

09:18.000 --> 09:19.000
Yes.

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
I asked
for butter on it.

09:19.000 --> 09:22.000
What--? What is that in the background?

09:20.000 --> 09:21.000
Butter's over there.

09:22.000 --> 09:25.000
Are you doing the music video thing again?

09:23.000 --> 09:26.000
I don't wanna put the butter
on it. Why can't you do it?

09:25.000 --> 09:26.000
Gotta go, honey. Bye.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.000
You're supposed to
put the butter on it.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.000
So many hours

09:27.000 --> 09:28.000
I don't wanna
put the butter on it.

09:28.000 --> 09:31.000
I'm already paying $20
for this bullshit popcorn.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.000
I'm still burnin'

09:31.000 --> 09:32.000
I will not demean myself

09:31.000 --> 09:33.000
When your feelin'

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
by putting butter
on popcorn.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.000
Why? It's really easy.
Why?

09:35.000 --> 09:37.000
Don't want to

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
Because I don't work at
the movie theater, that's why.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.000
You're supposed to put
the butter on it.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
If I go to Burger King
and order a cheeseburger,

09:42.000 --> 09:44.000
Bruise you

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
they don't make me put
the cheese on it, do

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
they, Goddamn it!

09:44.000 --> 09:46.000
Let it burn

09:45.000 --> 09:48.000
I see, I see. Just 'cause
your skin is light, bright,

09:46.000 --> 09:47.000
Let it burn

09:47.000 --> 09:50.000
Gotta let it burn

09:48.000 --> 09:50.000
and two shades
from being white,

09:50.000 --> 09:53.000
you think you too good
to butter your own popcorn.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.000
Oh

09:53.000 --> 09:56.000
Well, you wrong,
Lando Calrissian.

09:53.000 --> 09:57.000
Let it burn

09:56.000 --> 10:00.000
Damn it, Ruckus. Y'all gonna
put some butter on this popcorn.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.000
It's burning.

10:01.000 --> 10:03.000
Hey, Tom.
Shut the fuck up.

10:03.000 --> 10:05.000
GRANDDAD:
Boy, watch your mouth.

10:05.000 --> 10:08.000
We put our lives on the line
every day to make movies,

10:05.000 --> 10:06.000
Tom, shut
the fuck up.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.000
and then people come along
and steal all that hard work.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.000
Sorry. I'm so cold.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
Who would do something
like that?

10:13.000 --> 10:16.000
A terrible, awful human being
that no one will ever love.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
Could be worse.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.000
That's who.

10:17.000 --> 10:21.000
I'm so sorry, Mr. Stuntman.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
Could have been
Omarion.

10:21.000 --> 10:24.000
Thank you for that
perspective, Huey.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Hey. Get to the flick.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.000
No problem.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
What happened
to the movies?

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Y'all should be
ashamed.

10:26.000 --> 10:29.000
So I said, "I ain't paying
for dinner and a movie, woman.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.000
Why is it
when I order a soda pop,

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
I get a empty cup?

10:29.000 --> 10:30.000
"You must have lost
your damn mind.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.000
I didn't order
a empty cup.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
Shoot, I don't care
if you  are  Eva Mendes."

10:32.000 --> 10:33.000
I ordered a soda pop.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
And what asshole started putting
commercials in movies?

10:33.000 --> 10:35.000
Wait. What was
the question?

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
I can see commercials
at home on TV.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.000
So this is the message
you want to send

10:37.000 --> 10:40.000
And the bathroom stink.
Clean the fucking bathroom!

10:39.000 --> 10:40.000
to the young youth
out here like myself

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
I'm not gonna
take it anymore!

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
just tryin' to
do the right thing

10:41.000 --> 10:44.000
I pay too much damn money
for these movie tickets

10:42.000 --> 10:43.000
and not love
these ho's, huh?

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
W-w-w-what's all this?

10:44.000 --> 10:47.000
to butter my own
motherfucking popcorn!

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
Is this what's hot
right now in the streets?

10:47.000 --> 10:49.000
It's only popcorn.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.000
That's what's
really hood, huh?

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
All for some white girl who
left you for an R&B dancing-ass,

10:51.000 --> 10:53.000
sexy-flexy-
ass nigga?

10:52.000 --> 10:53.000
When did you
get here?

10:53.000 --> 10:54.000
Huh?

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
Well, I been at
the ticket window all day long,

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
TOM:
And so, sweetie,

10:55.000 --> 10:57.000
that's why Daddy is

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
and I don't remember you
buying no ticket,

10:57.000 --> 10:59.000
staying over at
the Freemans' house.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.000
Robert Freeman.

10:59.000 --> 11:02.000
So Mommy can have
her space.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.000
Uh, I-I-I got my tickets
online.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
Aha! A damn lie.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
So you're not
getting a divorce?

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
I ain't never
met a nigga

11:04.000 --> 11:06.000
Oh, no, sweetie.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.000
smart enough to use
a personal computer.

11:06.000 --> 11:10.000
So Usher won't be
my new daddy?

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
Not even a Macintosh.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Uh...

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
What? No.
Th-- That's ridiculous.

11:12.000 --> 11:14.000
You'll never take me alive,
you punk-asses.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.000
Oh. Are you sure?

11:14.000 --> 11:15.000
RUCKUS:
Stop him!

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Come on, come on.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
He went this-a way.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.000
Maybe just for
a little while?

11:17.000 --> 11:19.000
I mean, you like it here,
don't you, Daddy?

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
This is a...

11:21.000 --> 11:22.000
Mm-hmm.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.000
pretty-good-sized room.

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
I don't know what we're
gonna do, but we gotta do--

11:24.000 --> 11:25.000
Whew.
Did I miss anything?

11:25.000 --> 11:26.000
Mr. Freeman...

11:25.000 --> 11:27.000
Shh.
Here he comes.

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
I don't wanna steal the movie.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.000
Guys. I just
wanted to thank you

11:28.000 --> 11:29.000
I wanna go home!

11:29.000 --> 11:31.000
Shh!

11:30.000 --> 11:31.000
for letting me stay here.

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
What's wrong with you?

11:31.000 --> 11:32.000
I know it's been
an inconvenience.

11:32.000 --> 11:34.000
I wanna go home.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.000
Not at all, Tom.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
You wasn't saying that
back at the house, was you?

11:34.000 --> 11:36.000
You take as much time
as you need.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.000
Was you? Because you wanted
to see  Soul Plane 2.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
Well, this is how
we see  Soul Plane 2.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.000
We gotta do
whatever it takes

11:41.000 --> 11:45.000
I repeat, the terrorist said
his name is Kareem Abdul-Jabbar,

11:41.000 --> 11:42.000
to get him the hell
up out of here.

11:42.000 --> 11:44.000
Ooh. I got an idea.

11:45.000 --> 11:47.000
and he's demanding
that we --

11:45.000 --> 11:46.000
GRANDDAD:
Hey, Tom.

11:46.000 --> 11:48.000
Tom. Get
down here.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.000
Hell, no, I ain't fitting to ask him

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
for his motherfucking autograph.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
HUEY: An hour into the movie,

11:50.000 --> 11:53.000
Uh...what's goin' on, guys?

11:51.000 --> 11:53.000
I wasn't sure how much more I could take.

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
MAN: We out of food, but we got

11:53.000 --> 11:56.000
one bag of 'tato chips.

11:56.000 --> 11:57.000
Yo. Look out.

11:57.000 --> 11:59.000
Pass this bag of potato chips around.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Please take one. Pass it...

11:59.000 --> 12:01.000
Uh, Mr. DuBois,

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
He's in here.
I know Robert.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.000
my name is
A Pimp Named Slickback.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.000
He don't miss a coon flick.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.000
And this, sir,
is an intervention.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.000
What is it?
What's happening?

12:06.000 --> 12:07.000
An intervention?
Your friends have

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
Shh. Don't make a sound.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.000
reason to believe
you are suffering

12:09.000 --> 12:11.000
from chronic bitch
dependency, Mr. DuBois.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.000
May I call you Tom?

12:12.000 --> 12:14.000
Is this some kind
of joke?

12:14.000 --> 12:16.000
Tom...bitch dependency

12:15.000 --> 12:17.000
:  Ooh.
Damn.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.000
is no laughing matter.

12:17.000 --> 12:19.000
Let's go check Madea's Bat Mitzvah.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.000
Addiction to a bitch
can fuck with your friends,

12:19.000 --> 12:21.000
MAN:  Attention, please, passengers.

12:20.000 --> 12:23.000
your health, and scary enough,
even your money.

12:21.000 --> 12:24.000
If you left the toilet seat up in the restroom...

12:23.000 --> 12:25.000
It's a disease,
Tom.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.000
Wait. What was your name again?

12:27.000 --> 12:28.000
Well, thank you for asking.

12:28.000 --> 12:29.000
Officer,
I'm sorry.

12:28.000 --> 12:31.000
My name is
A Pimp Named Slickback.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.000
I didn't mean to steal
from the stuntman.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.000
Wait. "A pimp"?

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
Named Slickback.

12:34.000 --> 12:36.000
Yes. Please say the whole
thing if you would.

12:36.000 --> 12:37.000
What were you about to do?

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
Yes, that includes
the "A Pimp Named" part.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.000
You were about to rat on us,
weren't you?

12:38.000 --> 12:41.000
This is what the movie theater
industry wants, Jazmine.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.000
Yes, Tom.
Every time.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
Us fighting against
each other.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
Look, Mr. A Pimp Named
Slickback--

12:43.000 --> 12:46.000
Oh-ho-ho-ho, no.
There's no turning back now.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.000
No need for the "mister."

12:44.000 --> 12:46.000
I-I don't think
I need any help

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
You're in it
all the way.

12:46.000 --> 12:48.000
from someone like you.

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
Now you're gonna get your little
narrow, high-yellow ass

12:49.000 --> 12:50.000
And by

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
back into the theater
and enjoy  Soul Plane 2.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.000
"someone like me,"

12:51.000 --> 12:53.000
you mean a pimp?

12:53.000 --> 12:56.000
I...wanna...go...home!

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
A bad guy?

12:54.000 --> 12:56.000
Uh, look, I'm not
trying to insult you.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.000
Shut up.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.000
I just don't approve of
what you people do to women.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.000
You're ruining
my innocence!

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Shut up.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.000
Ohh.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
MAN: I expected to fly first-class.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
So I'm wrong.
So I'm messed up.

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
I wanna go home.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.000
Well, which one of us is
the one missin' a bitch, Tom?

13:03.000 --> 13:05.000
MAN 2: Well, you ain't in first class.

13:05.000 --> 13:08.000
You don't see me running around
lookin' for a bitch.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.000
I know where all
my bitches are,

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
Look at this.

13:09.000 --> 13:11.000
thank you very much.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Granddad. What's wrong
with Jazmine?

13:11.000 --> 13:13.000
Bitch, where you at?

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
: I'm out here

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
gettin' your money.

13:15.000 --> 13:17.000
She's fine.
Watch the movie.

13:16.000 --> 13:17.000
That's what the hell
I thought.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.000
Thank you, Grandma.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.000
Oh, that's crazy.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.000
Now look at you: bitchless.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
Look at this.
I...wanna...go...home.

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
"Sans bitch," as the French
in France would say.

13:23.000 --> 13:26.000
HUEY: Granddad had to be stopped.

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
I've had enough.
I'm going back upstairs.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.000
I'm gonna put an end
to this...

13:26.000 --> 13:27.000
GRANDDAD:
Tom.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
Tom, when we first
let you stay here,

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
or die trying.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.000
HUEY: And so did this movie.

13:30.000 --> 13:33.000
we thought it was only
gonna be temporary. But damn.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Fortunately, I thought of a way to do both.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
Tom, I just don't see
any end in sight.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.000
It's only been
two days.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.000
Nigga, hush. You're living
under my roof now.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.000
Move, nigga.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.000
Where you going?
They're looking for us.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.000
You're gonna get
some help.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
You know what?
I know a great therapist.

13:41.000 --> 13:43.000
Huey, come back.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.000
I'll make an appointment
today.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.000
That...

13:45.000 --> 13:47.000
Oh, this is crazy.
Colored folks are something.

13:45.000 --> 13:48.000
also would have been
a good idea, but...

13:48.000 --> 13:51.000
we've already paid
Mr. A Pimp Named Slickback

13:51.000 --> 13:53.000
a retainer of $2500.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.000
HUEY:  My plan was to get to the projector room

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Robert, you shouldn't have.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.000
and destroy the print of  Soul Plane.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
With your credit card.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.000
Oh.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
A PIMP NAMED SLICKBACK:
Did you know

13:59.000 --> 14:01.000
that scientists now believe

14:02.000 --> 14:05.000
First, I had to go to the bathroom.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.000
that some people
are actually born

14:03.000 --> 14:06.000
with a genetic
predisposition

14:06.000 --> 14:08.000
to bitch
dependency, Tom?

14:08.000 --> 14:10.000
And exactly when did you become
a relationship counselor?

14:09.000 --> 14:11.000
Jazmine, you're missing
all the best parts.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
Well, sharing
this pimp knowledge

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
I'm not watching
a stolen movie.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.000
for an exorbitant fee
is my way of giving

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Oh, well.
If you don't wanna laugh.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.000
something back
to the community, Tom.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.000
I want to help you,
Tom. I do.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
Oh, that's crazy.
What's so funny?

14:18.000 --> 14:20.000
But I need you to
help me...

14:19.000 --> 14:21.000
Oh, nothing. Hilarity
just ensued, that's all.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
It did?

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
help you.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Huh.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.000
"Help me help you."
Yeah, okay.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Oh. Oh. Oh!

14:25.000 --> 14:27.000
Now...tell me, if you would,

14:27.000 --> 14:29.000
That was funny.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.000
about this bitch you have
an unhealthy dependency on.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.000
Hm? Ah.

14:30.000 --> 14:33.000
Could we please
not call her a bi-- Bi--?

14:33.000 --> 14:34.000
Say it. "Bitch." Yeah.
Bitch.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
Uh, yes, we've gotta
call her that, Tom.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
RUCKUS:
It's about impossible

14:35.000 --> 14:37.000
to find his black ass

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
I'm sorry.
After what she's done,

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
in this dark theater.

14:38.000 --> 14:41.000
not callin' her a bitch
would be disrespectful to you.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.000
Yo. I think we need
to shake the spizzot.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.000
Huh? What?

14:41.000 --> 14:42.000
And I'm not able
to do that.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.000
Now please continue,
Tom.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.000
Well, my wife, Sarah--

14:46.000 --> 14:50.000
I mean-- She's the best
woman in the world.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.000
Forget Jazmine. Let's go.
But we couldn't.

14:49.000 --> 14:51.000
She the weak link.
She'll slow us down.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.000
We've had a great life
together until now.

14:51.000 --> 14:54.000
I mean, how could we?
Look, she a little girl.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.000
They're not gonna give her
no real time.

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
She do what?
A couple months, tops.

14:57.000 --> 15:00.000
But we both got priors.
We gots to go.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.000
Come on, Granddad.
We running out of time.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.000
Sometimes,

15:04.000 --> 15:05.000
in order to save the day,

15:05.000 --> 15:07.000
people have to sacrifice
themselves,

15:07.000 --> 15:08.000
you know what
I'm saying?

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
Oh, Air Marshal 50 Cent.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.000
You're so brave

15:13.000 --> 15:16.000
to sacrifice yourself
to save us.

15:16.000 --> 15:17.000
Not me, bitch. You.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Oh! Wait! Oh. Oh.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
A PIMP NAMED SLICKBACK:
It sounds to me, Tom,

15:24.000 --> 15:25.000
like some of
the passion

15:26.000 --> 15:27.000
has gone out of
your marriage.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.000
Hey. Hold this.
We be right back.

15:27.000 --> 15:30.000
And perhaps you're not providing
enough excitement for her.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
Okay.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.000
It's a normal thing
in long-term relationships.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Exactly. See,
what Marx is saying

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
And you can
help me fix it?

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
is that the oppression
of the proletariat

15:35.000 --> 15:37.000
Hell no. I'm gonna help you
make that bitch behave.

15:37.000 --> 15:38.000
is an essential facet
of the exploitation

15:37.000 --> 15:40.000
She wants excitement, she can
take her ass to the movies.

15:39.000 --> 15:40.000
inherent in the system.

15:40.000 --> 15:41.000
So therefore,
due to the class --

15:46.000 --> 15:48.000
You little
half-and-half.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.000
Did you know that at least
75 percent of bitches

15:53.000 --> 15:55.000
suffer from some kind
of hearing loss?

15:55.000 --> 15:58.000
This alarming statistic
means that more likely than not,

15:58.000 --> 16:00.000
HUEY: Oh, man.

15:58.000 --> 16:01.000
talking isn't
the most effective way

16:01.000 --> 16:02.000
to communicate
with a bitch.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
He's in there.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
That's when you
have to hit her.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.000
Whoa. What?

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
What--? What happened
to my--?

16:05.000 --> 16:07.000
You tell her what
you want her to do.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
If she say, "No,"
hit the bitch. Simple.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.000
But I-- I couldn't
hit Sarah.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.000
Damn.

16:11.000 --> 16:12.000
I couldn't hit
any woman.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.000
Has not hittin' a bitch
been working?

16:13.000 --> 16:14.000
He's right there!

16:15.000 --> 16:16.000
I mean,
scientifically speaking,

16:16.000 --> 16:19.000
has not hittin' the bitch
achieved the desired results?

16:17.000 --> 16:19.000
Hey!

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
No way. I just--

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
I-- I-I can't. I-- I couldn't.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.000
Tom.
I won't.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.000
Tom, Take a deep breath.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.000
It's okay. People have phobias.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
GUARD: Yeah.

16:28.000 --> 16:30.000
Some niggas can't
cross bridges,

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
you can't go upside
a bitch's head.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.000
Okay. We can beat this.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.000
Tom, this is
my bottom bitch,

16:37.000 --> 16:38.000
Sweetest Taboo.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
Now, she's gonna
help you learn how to

16:40.000 --> 16:43.000
reestablish dominance
at home.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.000
Hello. Heh.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.000
Taboo will be playing
the role of your wife.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Now, approach
Taboo,

16:48.000 --> 16:49.000
grab her arm
firmly

16:49.000 --> 16:50.000
RUCKUS: Ah...

16:49.000 --> 16:51.000
and command her
to leave with you.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.000
Okay.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.000
Sarah,
get your behind--

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
I been waiting
on this day

16:54.000 --> 16:57.000
Stop, stop. Say "bitch."

16:56.000 --> 16:59.000
since your little uppity ass
came into town.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.000
Do I have to call her
a bitch, really?

16:58.000 --> 17:01.000
Yes, Tom. You have to
call her a bitch.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.000
Trust me
on this one.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.000
I've done the research.
Now, try again.

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
Bitch, get
your behind--

17:08.000 --> 17:12.000
You won't kill me, Air Marshal 50 Cent.

17:09.000 --> 17:10.000
Ass.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.000
You'll only die trying.

17:12.000 --> 17:15.000
Bitch. Get your ass
in the car.

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
Kiss my ass, you little-dick,
faggot motherfucker.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.000
Or, uh, I'm, uh--

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
Or...

17:18.000 --> 17:20.000
If you was any kind of real man,
I wouldn't be here

17:19.000 --> 17:20.000
Or I'm gonna die...

17:20.000 --> 17:23.000
with Usher
in the first place!

17:21.000 --> 17:22.000
trying.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.000
What? What?

17:23.000 --> 17:24.000
You thought you was the only one

17:23.000 --> 17:25.000
Wait, hold on. I don't think
that's what Sarah would say.

17:24.000 --> 17:28.000
who mastered the ancient
and deadly art of the nunchaku?

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
It's now tragically
obvious

17:27.000 --> 17:29.000
that reasoning
with the bitch

17:29.000 --> 17:30.000
is not
gonna work, Tom.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.000
You have to
hit her.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.000
I am an assistant district
attorney, for chrissake.

17:34.000 --> 17:35.000
Tom...

17:35.000 --> 17:37.000
you have to
get past this.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.000
It's okay,
faggot...really.

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
See, faggot? She just
gave you permission.

17:41.000 --> 17:43.000
Ah. My chin--
You see that?

17:43.000 --> 17:45.000
Bitch is hittin' you.
All right, lady.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
Okay-- Ow!

17:46.000 --> 17:48.000
You're definitely allowed
by law to hit her now, Tom.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.000
It's self-defense.
I didn't do anything.

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
Okay?
Sweetest Taboo,

17:50.000 --> 17:52.000
you are in rare form.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.000
This is my state-of-the-art
surveillance center.

17:58.000 --> 18:00.000
Why does a pimp need
a surveillance center?

18:00.000 --> 18:01.000
Here's 50.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.000
Included in
your retainer fee

18:01.000 --> 18:03.000
Ah...

18:02.000 --> 18:04.000
is state-of-the-art
bitch surveillance.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Come,  negro-san.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.000
Quiet Storm here
has been monitoring

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
your wife's
conversations and e-mails.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.000
Daddy, I've got transcripts
of all her conversations today.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
No mention of Usher.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
I'm hacking
into her e-mail now,

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
That was great, Granddad.

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
but, tsk, this computer
is running a bit slow.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
Boy, I wish we could've seen
the end of that movie.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.000
I don't know.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
Perhaps if we didn't
have dial-up.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
I feel bad for leaving Huey
and what's-her-name.

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
Bitch, don't start
with that

18:19.000 --> 18:20.000
They knew the risks.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
So they might do
a little time.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.000
"we need another
computer" shit.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
You say that shit every time
a new iMac comes out.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.000
We see 'em when they get out.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
Uh...it doesn't seem right.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.000
You ain't slick.
You better

18:25.000 --> 18:27.000
I'm going back
and turning myself in.

18:25.000 --> 18:26.000
make that G4 work,
bitch,

18:26.000 --> 18:28.000
and stop playin'
with me.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.000
Turn yourself--?
Man--

18:28.000 --> 18:29.000
Yes, Daddy.

18:29.000 --> 18:30.000
Granddad, look, come on.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.000
I mean, I love Huey.
Almost like a brother.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
Nothing in the e-mail.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.000
Does she have
a MySpace page?

18:32.000 --> 18:36.000
But what's done is done.
We got to let go of the past.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.000
MySpace?

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
I don't think Sarah
would have a--

18:34.000 --> 18:37.000
Found it.

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
If he don't come back,
can I have his side of the room?

18:37.000 --> 18:38.000
Huh.

18:38.000 --> 18:40.000
Uh, since when did
she have a MySpace page?

18:40.000 --> 18:42.000
Ah, come on, Granddad.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.000
You know what her password
might be?

18:42.000 --> 18:44.000
You supposed to be setting
a better example.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.000
Um. Gosh-golly, we--
We usually use

18:44.000 --> 18:46.000
You just wait till
the manager gets here.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.000
each other's middle names
as passwords,

18:47.000 --> 18:49.000
He gonna throw the book
at both of y'all.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.000
so mine would be
Lancaster.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.000
That's L-A-N--
Got it.

18:49.000 --> 18:52.000
This  is
the worst day...

18:50.000 --> 18:52.000
Password is "Usher."
Here we go.

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
of my entire life.

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
Message to Usher.

18:53.000 --> 18:55.000
They're getting together
at 3:00

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
Told you.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.000
at the Woodcrest
Chateau Hotel.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.000
That's in an hour.
We have to go.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
Here's the guardian
for the kids.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.000
You have to take me!

19:00.000 --> 19:01.000
That's right,
Ruckus.

19:00.000 --> 19:02.000
Tom, if you're not ready
to take control,

19:01.000 --> 19:03.000
We snuck
into the movie, too.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.000
then going there won't help.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.000
We?  You said you was gonna
turn  yourself  in.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.000
I say let the bitch go.

19:05.000 --> 19:09.000
I paid you $2000,
and $500 as well.

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
Please. Let the kids go.
I'll take responsibility.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.000
Now, Tom, I hope
you can appreciate

19:10.000 --> 19:12.000
Look like y'all
all going down.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.000
our no-refunds policy.

19:12.000 --> 19:14.000
How about a complimentary date
with Sweetest Taboo?

19:13.000 --> 19:14.000
The manager's
not coming.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.000
Cinema's closed
indefinitely.

19:15.000 --> 19:16.000
No, no, no.

19:16.000 --> 19:19.000
Looks like everyone walked out.
Something about a union.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.000
You're still
on retainer,

19:17.000 --> 19:19.000
and we're
going now.

19:19.000 --> 19:22.000
What?
The manager ain't coming?

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
Ohh...

19:22.000 --> 19:23.000
Well, call the police.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.000
Now the nigga can get
some bass in his voice.

19:23.000 --> 19:26.000
The FBI.
Homeland Security.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
Yeah, bitch. Let's go.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.000
You mean,
we gonna let

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
this African hooliganism
go unpunished?

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
You have problems, Mr. Freeman,
and you need help.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000
Thanks for coming back...

19:34.000 --> 19:35.000
eventually.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.000
Yo, you need to stop
snitching, Granddad.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.000
Ah. Ow. Hey.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.000
Why don't you call
social services

19:40.000 --> 19:42.000
and turn yourself in
for child abuse?

19:40.000 --> 19:41.000
TOM:
There they are.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.000
Remember to hit the bitch.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Hey, man.

19:48.000 --> 19:50.000
Right.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.000
Thank you so much for
doing that. I mean, you guys

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
You guys unionized and staged
a walkout that quickly?

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
just went above and beyond.

19:53.000 --> 19:55.000
I mean, really--

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
That's amazing.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
Oh, yeah.
We unionized.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
Sarah.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
I mean, bitch...

19:57.000 --> 19:58.000
Then someone called
the corporate headquarters,

19:58.000 --> 19:59.000
and they shut down
the whole place.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
get your ass in the car.

19:59.000 --> 20:01.000
Fired everybody.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.000
Oh.

20:01.000 --> 20:04.000
Excuse me, Dolemite.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
Well, um...

20:04.000 --> 20:05.000
power to the people?

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
You heard me, beyotch.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.000
Fuck you.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.000
Tom, please calm down

20:08.000 --> 20:10.000
and let me go.

20:12.000 --> 20:13.000
Well, that's that.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.000
I think we all learned
a valuable lesson today

20:15.000 --> 20:17.000
about stealing movies.

20:17.000 --> 20:18.000
Buy the bootleg.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
Hey, look, man,
I think you should calm down.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.000
Or just download it
from the Internet

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
like everybody else.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.000
Ah!

20:23.000 --> 20:25.000
The hell--?
TOM: You can't have my wife!

20:26.000 --> 20:27.000
Tom!

20:27.000 --> 20:31.000
Daddy. What did you do
to Usher?

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
Hey. Can you guys wait
here a sec?

20:31.000 --> 20:34.000
There's something
I need to take care of.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.000
Jazmine?

20:32.000 --> 20:35.000
Daddy. Leave Usher alone.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.000
What are you doing?

20:36.000 --> 20:39.000
Why are you trying
to kill Usher?

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Yes, Super Fly.
What did Usher ever do to you?

20:41.000 --> 20:43.000
Jazmine wanted
to meet Usher.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.000
You're an animal.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.000
Is Usher okay?

20:47.000 --> 20:49.000
So you're not--?
No.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.000
GUARD: Uh-huh, uh-huh.
Easy, boys.

20:51.000 --> 20:52.000
Ow!

20:52.000 --> 20:53.000
Yeah, nigga.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.000
TOM:
Oh, okay. I see what this is.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.000
SARAH:
Stop! Don't hurt him.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
He didn't
mean it.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
He was trying to hit me.

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
Tom!
TOM:

21:05.000 --> 21:08.000
I've never felt so much pain!

21:08.000 --> 21:12.000
I'm sorry, Usher!

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
USHER:
Shut the fuck up,

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
Tom.
