02:19.222 --> 02:20.891
- Cetarti?
- Yes.

02:21.767 --> 02:23.644
You said you were an hour away.

02:24.061 --> 02:28.565
Yeah, but after we talked,
I fell asleep.

02:29.483 --> 02:31.443
Why didn't you answer the phone?

02:32.819 --> 02:36.490
I didn't have any signal.
I was out of battery.

02:39.117 --> 02:41.161
Duarte.
I'm sorry about your loss.

02:41.244 --> 02:44.289
I regret to meet you
in such terrible circumstances.

02:44.581 --> 02:46.166
How was the drive up?

02:48.293 --> 02:49.127
Long.

02:50.671 --> 02:53.340
It won't take long.
But you have to identify them.

03:10.148 --> 03:11.149
Your ID, please.

03:16.154 --> 03:17.322
The bucket.

03:24.955 --> 03:27.082
It'll be hard. Uncover them.

03:41.805 --> 03:42.973
Cover up, cover up.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.937
Fine. He identified them.

03:49.146 --> 03:51.898
Write the ID number down,
and I'll do a scribble.

03:52.149 --> 03:52.983
Good.

03:54.735 --> 03:57.195
- Cremate them, too.
- All right.

03:57.738 --> 03:58.989
That's for you.

04:00.073 --> 04:03.034
- Is Molina ready to go?
- Yes, right there.

04:03.201 --> 04:04.745
Quick, go get him for me!

04:21.261 --> 04:23.805
He'll cremate them, as planned.

04:27.976 --> 04:29.478
No, this one is Molina.

04:30.353 --> 04:32.439
Yours will be ready tomorrow.

04:33.648 --> 04:35.817
You save on the wake,
the burial.

04:36.067 --> 04:37.360
Who is Molina?

04:39.321 --> 04:42.407
The guy who killed your mother
and brother.

04:44.785 --> 04:48.288
Tomorrow, you'll come pick up
the ashes and sign the papers,

04:48.497 --> 04:50.499
make it all official.

04:51.666 --> 04:53.752
Now we go to the police station.

04:56.421 --> 04:57.964
One thing is certain:

04:58.924 --> 05:00.967
On February 11,

05:01.176 --> 05:05.347
retired air force sergeant
Daniel Molina,

05:06.765 --> 05:09.351
represented here by Mr. Duarte,

05:09.935 --> 05:12.771
shot his partner...

05:12.979 --> 05:15.190
With a hunting rifle.

05:15.357 --> 05:18.193
But you're representing the murderer?

05:18.401 --> 05:21.279
Yes, to make it faster.
I'll explain later. Keep going.

05:22.614 --> 05:24.908
With a hunting rifle,

05:25.200 --> 05:29.538
leading to the death
of Ms. Amelia Suarez

05:30.205 --> 05:32.332
and her son Emilio Cetarti.

05:32.749 --> 05:34.793
Molina then committed suicide.

05:35.418 --> 05:37.504
His motive is still unclear.

05:37.754 --> 05:39.422
Do you have any idea?

05:40.799 --> 05:41.675
Me?

05:42.259 --> 05:46.012
No. I was totally out of touch
with them.

05:46.221 --> 05:47.639
We're from TucumÃ¡n.

05:47.848 --> 05:51.726
I left for Buenos Aires at 18,
and barely saw them, after that.

05:51.935 --> 05:54.062
I didn't know that my mother

05:54.187 --> 05:56.314
had remarried,
and was living with my brother.

05:56.523 --> 05:59.401
No, your mother lived with Molina.
Your brother was visiting.

05:59.693 --> 06:04.114
You don't know if there was any trouble
between your brother and Molina?

06:04.781 --> 06:05.907
I don't know.

06:08.994 --> 06:13.999
Tell me, why are you representing
this Mr. Molina?

06:14.373 --> 06:18.879
It so happens that I am
the executor of his will.

06:20.130 --> 06:24.342
An executor makes sure the last wishes
of the deceased are respected.

06:25.384 --> 06:27.137
Molina and I, we are...

06:29.472 --> 06:33.351
Well, I am, and he was,
a retired air force sergeant.

06:33.685 --> 06:37.230
In the armed forces, you always name
a buddy as executor,

06:37.396 --> 06:42.611
to help the family
with the paperwork and all.

06:43.111 --> 06:45.530
If it had happened to me,

06:46.031 --> 06:48.033
he'd have done it for me.

06:48.241 --> 06:51.828
You mentioned insurance?
Is it life insurance?

06:52.954 --> 06:54.080
Here's what's up.

06:54.289 --> 06:57.709
Molina had taken out a policy
in your mother's name.

06:58.335 --> 07:01.546
25,000 pesos,
from the air force charity fund.

07:02.631 --> 07:04.257
Due to what happened,

07:04.423 --> 07:07.594
we can arrange it
so you get the money.

07:08.470 --> 07:09.387
It won't be easy,

07:10.013 --> 07:11.431
but if I pull it off,

07:11.640 --> 07:16.186
we'll split the profits fifty-fifty.
What do you say to that?

07:18.438 --> 07:20.148
We're liable to go to jail.

07:20.523 --> 07:23.818
Don't worry,
I know all the right people.

07:24.903 --> 07:26.529
Wait a minute.

07:28.365 --> 07:31.618
Don't you have a disability?

07:33.995 --> 07:34.788
What?

07:35.664 --> 07:38.083
Yes, a mental disability.

07:38.541 --> 07:39.751
No. Why should I?

07:41.086 --> 07:44.255
It's a shame. I could claim
more money for you.

07:45.465 --> 07:48.259
I'll take care of it,
and keep you informed.

07:48.677 --> 07:49.678
Tell me,

07:49.928 --> 07:51.680
how did you track me down?

07:52.931 --> 07:56.434
Your address and number
were in your mother's notebook.

07:56.893 --> 07:59.145
There was paperwork to manage.

07:59.354 --> 08:01.606
For the best outcome possible.

08:02.273 --> 08:05.110
It's weird that she had my number.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.988
Can we stop by her place
and see if I can find something useful?

08:08.196 --> 08:09.572
Sure, let's go.

08:09.823 --> 08:13.284
But we'll run into
Molina's ex-wife there.

08:13.827 --> 08:16.121
- How come?
- It's her house now.

08:16.413 --> 08:20.291
It was in Molina's name,
but since he didn't marry your mother...

08:21.459 --> 08:22.377
It's there.

08:27.590 --> 08:28.967
Duarte. Why are you here?

08:32.136 --> 08:33.429
I brought you this.

08:54.159 --> 08:56.327
This man is the dead woman's son.

08:59.539 --> 09:02.500
- Her other son.
- Yes, that's me,

09:03.001 --> 09:04.002
Javier.

09:05.086 --> 09:06.504
I'm terribly sorry.

09:07.839 --> 09:09.966
He came to see his mother's things.

09:10.550 --> 09:13.553
What a disaster!
Isn't it, son?

09:15.764 --> 09:17.891
I had nothing to do
with any of it,

09:18.099 --> 09:21.186
and yet here I am,
cleaning up this mess.

09:22.103 --> 09:24.105
I've always been the dumbest.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.069
Go look around.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.530
You may find something.

10:51.734 --> 10:52.610
Here.

10:53.319 --> 10:56.364
These are the keys
your brother was carrying.

10:56.990 --> 10:59.701
From his place, I guess.
We can go and see if they work.

11:00.618 --> 11:03.413
- You didn't find anything?
- I'm finished.

11:03.621 --> 11:07.083
Done looking?
I'll drop you off at your brother's.

11:07.292 --> 11:11.838
I didn't know him,
but I know where he lives. Or lived.

11:12.755 --> 11:13.672
Let's go.

11:17.051 --> 11:18.595
Marta, we're leaving!

11:19.678 --> 11:21.973
Okay. Leave me the keys.

11:23.308 --> 11:24.559
Excuse me? What?

11:25.018 --> 11:26.644
The keys to the house.

11:34.110 --> 11:35.111
Goodbye.

11:35.737 --> 11:37.030
I'm sorry.

12:00.678 --> 12:02.180
It looks abandoned.

12:02.430 --> 12:06.184
It does,
but your brother lived here.

12:09.437 --> 12:10.813
You know,

12:11.648 --> 12:14.359
you ought to stay here
for a few days,

12:15.485 --> 12:17.695
while we fill out
the insurance claim.

12:19.197 --> 12:22.741
It's cheaper than the hotel,
or returning to Buenos Aires

12:23.034 --> 12:24.285
and driving up again.

12:27.038 --> 12:30.875
Yes... It'll only take a few days
to get the money, right?

12:32.210 --> 12:35.255
No, first we have to fill out
the whole claim,

12:35.463 --> 12:36.631
and file it.

12:37.590 --> 12:39.300
Then, you'll have to wait.

12:39.968 --> 12:42.262
You may be able to go home.
We'll see.

12:43.221 --> 12:46.057
Be patient.
If I hadn't phoned you,

12:46.891 --> 12:50.979
the insurance money
would have gone to the State.

12:51.521 --> 12:53.064
I'm grateful to you.

12:53.481 --> 12:54.649
You're welcome, son!

12:55.733 --> 12:58.444
I forgot to ask.
Do you need a ride back?

12:59.320 --> 13:02.323
Don't worry about it.
If I walk a little way,

13:02.532 --> 13:04.617
I'll find a lift, I'm sure.

13:08.663 --> 13:09.788
Chifle!

13:10.789 --> 13:12.959
Can you drop me off
at the vet's?

17:49.193 --> 17:51.028
Eating crap again!

17:51.862 --> 17:53.406
Feed yourself right.

17:54.156 --> 17:55.950
I had dinner. This is dessert.

18:01.455 --> 18:04.458
You have to take me
to the cemetery.

18:05.042 --> 18:06.002
What for?

18:07.211 --> 18:08.379
That's my own business.

18:09.880 --> 18:11.841
We'll be there and back
in a day.

18:12.633 --> 18:14.594
I'll check with Duarte about it.

18:14.802 --> 18:17.263
Why do you have to ask Duarte
for permission?

18:18.472 --> 18:20.433
I'm not asking his permission,

18:21.559 --> 18:23.311
but we have stuff to do.

18:27.773 --> 18:30.067
He played dumb, with the keys.

18:35.573 --> 18:38.534
We have to move
your father's furniture out,

18:40.536 --> 18:44.206
burn it all,
and then we'll go live there.

18:44.999 --> 18:46.917
I don't mind our house.

18:47.084 --> 18:48.169
But I do.

18:48.419 --> 18:50.796
Why keep living
in a borrowed home?

18:52.340 --> 18:56.010
I dream of the day that you do not have
to see Duarte's face ever.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.305
You'll help me, won't you?

18:59.555 --> 19:00.598
Do what?

19:00.973 --> 19:03.100
Burn the furniture.

19:04.894 --> 19:05.686
Yes.

21:14.648 --> 21:17.234
Isn't your mom
giving the pills to the dogs?

21:17.443 --> 21:18.944
I think so.

21:19.153 --> 21:20.821
Maybe they're like people.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.616
Maybe they get a tolerance
to the pills.

21:25.159 --> 21:27.745
Here. Tell her to increase the dose.

21:28.954 --> 21:32.124
But not too much.
Asleep, they're useless.

21:34.877 --> 21:36.128
I brought you some weed.

21:37.379 --> 21:39.673
Make it last you two days, at least.

21:59.318 --> 22:00.736
Did you behave?

24:46.151 --> 24:48.445
Do you have something
to wrap this up?

25:05.796 --> 25:07.381
- Thanks.
- Bye.

25:38.245 --> 25:42.540
I talked to the people at the air force
charity fund and the sergeants' club.

25:43.375 --> 25:45.169
There's absolutely no problem.

25:45.377 --> 25:48.672
But those buzzards
want a kickback.

25:48.922 --> 25:50.466
Get my drift?

25:50.632 --> 25:52.509
You'll get a total of 32,000.

25:52.718 --> 25:54.845
12 for you, 12 for me,

25:55.054 --> 25:58.265
and 8 for the bribery money.
Is that okay?

25:58.515 --> 26:00.976
You said 25,000, before.

26:01.185 --> 26:03.479
And I thought
I'd get the money today.

26:03.645 --> 26:06.190
But I told them
you were handicapped,

26:06.398 --> 26:09.526
half-paralyzed,
and practically unable to manage.

26:09.860 --> 26:12.196
It's great.
You'll get more money.

26:12.446 --> 26:15.532
It'll take longer,
but you can stay a while...

26:15.991 --> 26:16.784
Sure.

26:17.910 --> 26:19.161
I can stay a while.

26:20.079 --> 26:20.954
Good.

26:21.579 --> 26:23.499
Take this. You can keep it.

26:26.627 --> 26:29.546
Ernesto...
Address...

26:31.799 --> 26:33.509
The certificate.

26:36.386 --> 26:40.598
Javier Cetarti.
I have the instructions, and a model.

26:41.433 --> 26:44.228
Let me have your ID, please.

26:49.775 --> 26:51.693
Javier Ernesto...

26:52.653 --> 26:55.155
I print it out, you sign it,

26:55.739 --> 26:56.740
and we're done!

27:03.747 --> 27:05.916
How's your brother's house?

27:06.750 --> 27:07.584
It's fine.

27:08.001 --> 27:09.837
It's cluttered, but it's okay.

27:10.087 --> 27:11.046
Sign this.

27:16.718 --> 27:18.762
I hear he was a hoarder.

27:23.559 --> 27:24.393
Yes.

27:24.601 --> 27:28.313
He had a few things
that are worth a little money.

27:28.522 --> 27:31.108
Since I'm broke,

27:31.316 --> 27:33.610
I was going to ask around...

27:33.819 --> 27:36.613
Know anybody who might
be interested in the stuff?

27:37.655 --> 27:39.283
In buying that crap?

27:39.867 --> 27:42.119
I know everything here.
Every detail.

27:44.163 --> 27:46.206
I don't usually smoke,

27:48.542 --> 27:49.877
but this is good stuff.

27:50.961 --> 27:52.880
Whenever you want, I keep it around.

27:53.422 --> 27:55.966
- Is 600 okay?
- Yes.

27:58.177 --> 27:59.011
A done deal.

27:59.511 --> 28:00.304
All right.

28:02.055 --> 28:02.890
Good.

28:05.267 --> 28:07.561
All the money's there.

28:08.187 --> 28:09.021
Good.

28:09.354 --> 28:11.523
- A pleasure.
- For me, too.

28:12.232 --> 28:12.983
Chico!

28:13.233 --> 28:14.484
Bye, Duarte!

28:41.511 --> 28:42.763
They're poisonous.

28:43.055 --> 28:44.890
They are not poisonous scarabs.

28:45.557 --> 28:46.600
Aren't they?

28:48.852 --> 28:51.230
See the guy who bought your shit?

28:51.480 --> 28:53.357
Why do you think he limps?

28:54.900 --> 28:56.693
A scarab bit him.

28:58.237 --> 29:00.697
His toes turned grey,

29:01.323 --> 29:02.282
then black.

29:02.491 --> 29:04.701
Finally, they had to amputate.

29:04.910 --> 29:06.870
To stop the gangrene.

29:07.120 --> 29:09.539
See how he bobs when he walks?

29:13.502 --> 29:14.586
See you later!

29:14.753 --> 29:15.879
Bye, chief!

29:21.009 --> 29:22.928
I got you 500 pesos for that.

29:32.896 --> 29:35.941
I'm not the type of guy
who makes demands,

29:36.191 --> 29:40.445
but I think I deserve a lunch
from you, for all of these favours.

29:40.946 --> 29:42.072
No problem.

29:44.116 --> 29:46.827
He asked me
if you were selling the car.

29:47.077 --> 29:48.912
How do I get back to Buenos Aires?

29:49.162 --> 29:51.331
Buy a new one
with the insurance money.

29:51.540 --> 29:54.376
Think about it.
I can get you a better and cheaper one.

29:55.836 --> 29:57.963
How did you meet Molina?

30:03.385 --> 30:05.387
We were great buddies.

30:06.555 --> 30:08.223
But he was an alcoholic.

30:09.016 --> 30:10.726
He had become very violent.

30:13.395 --> 30:15.897
He was my mentor in the air force.

30:16.857 --> 30:19.443
I was his pupil.
He taught me everything!

30:19.651 --> 30:20.902
Everything I know

30:21.236 --> 30:22.362
about life,

30:23.196 --> 30:24.323
the air force.

30:25.449 --> 30:26.700
I admired him.

30:28.285 --> 30:30.370
As a soldier and as a person.

30:30.787 --> 30:32.581
Then, one day he came around

30:33.665 --> 30:36.376
with that Spanish whore.

30:38.337 --> 30:39.463
You should've seen her.

30:40.881 --> 30:43.216
A perfect bitch. Magnificent.

30:45.761 --> 30:49.514
She looks like a slob, now.
A madwoman. Fucking bitch.

30:49.723 --> 30:51.892
Back then, she was
the prettiest woman around.

30:52.392 --> 30:53.560
The problem is

30:54.478 --> 30:57.522
Molina left her high and dry
with the kid,

30:57.731 --> 30:59.191
to live with your mother.

31:00.359 --> 31:03.695
He started
some serious messing around.

31:05.530 --> 31:07.824
Before, he was full of high ideals,

31:07.991 --> 31:09.785
he was extremely elegant.

31:11.161 --> 31:14.247
But then he got conceited,
acting like a jackass.

31:15.957 --> 31:17.876
Pussy is what changed him.

31:18.418 --> 31:21.046
Are you interested at all
in my stories?

31:21.588 --> 31:22.839
No... Yes.

31:26.009 --> 31:27.969
How did Molina meet my mother?

31:30.305 --> 31:34.059
That I don't know.
But if you were from TucumÃ¡n,

31:34.643 --> 31:36.561
he must have met her there.

31:37.729 --> 31:41.024
We often used to go there,
to the mountains,

31:41.733 --> 31:44.194
to check
on the cleanup operations.

31:45.195 --> 31:46.822
We did the follow-up,

31:47.531 --> 31:50.283
getting rid of any assholes
and troublemakers.

31:55.497 --> 31:56.623
Anyway,

31:57.457 --> 31:59.626
it was atomically boring.

32:01.878 --> 32:03.588
What's your line of work?

32:04.339 --> 32:06.508
I'm on unemployment right now.

32:07.092 --> 32:09.886
I got fired 6 months ago.
I was a public employee.

32:12.264 --> 32:15.142
You got yourself fired
from a civil service job?

32:17.227 --> 32:19.438
I quit going to work
for a whole year.

32:20.105 --> 32:21.982
Why did you do that?

32:23.150 --> 32:24.901
I had nothing to do.

32:25.735 --> 32:27.904
But you had the dream job.

32:28.071 --> 32:30.073
Getting paid to do nothing!

32:30.782 --> 32:34.828
You must be the first civil servant
in human history to get fired.

32:34.995 --> 32:36.413
What talent!

32:36.955 --> 32:40.375
If I have nothing to do,
I'd rather stay home.

32:42.961 --> 32:45.464
God gives pants
to people without asses.

32:46.673 --> 32:48.008
Molina did you a favour.

32:48.258 --> 32:50.760
At least you have to sell
your brother's junk.

33:12.866 --> 33:15.744
I'm sick of depending
on that bastard.

33:17.704 --> 33:21.041
Tell him we're giving back
his shitty house.

33:21.374 --> 33:23.335
He can take it and shove it.

33:30.509 --> 33:32.385
I told you I will stay there.

36:00.367 --> 36:02.202
You're going to look terrific.

36:04.913 --> 36:05.997
Very good!

36:20.095 --> 36:21.054
Ready.

36:21.221 --> 36:23.223
What's wrong with the dogs?

36:24.307 --> 36:26.309
If they're barking,
we can't move him.

36:52.127 --> 36:53.920
She burned everything.

36:55.171 --> 36:56.798
I hope you checked first!

36:57.048 --> 36:58.299
There wasn't anything?

36:58.842 --> 36:59.634
No.

36:59.843 --> 37:00.760
What do you mean?

37:02.846 --> 37:06.182
Your father
had just gotten a sum of money.

37:06.349 --> 37:09.352
I hunted for it,
to give it to you, of course.

37:09.602 --> 37:11.146
But I didn't find it.

37:11.980 --> 37:14.733
- How much money?
- I don't know. Not much.

37:15.900 --> 37:16.776
Money from where?

37:17.026 --> 37:21.072
Intelligence ops.
Then your mother moved in,

37:21.239 --> 37:22.949
and I couldn't go back.

37:24.117 --> 37:26.619
She doesn't have it.
She'd have told me.

37:29.164 --> 37:31.541
She wants to go to the graveyard.

37:32.208 --> 37:35.044
I don't know
what the fuck she wants to do there.

37:38.089 --> 37:40.133
Visit your baby brother.

37:42.552 --> 37:44.179
That surprised you.

37:44.804 --> 37:48.224
I figured
your mother hadn't told you.

37:48.892 --> 37:52.645
Your parents had a son
who died before you were born.

37:53.313 --> 37:56.399
He has the same name
as you and your father.

37:57.358 --> 37:59.652
I mean, he had the same name.

38:01.613 --> 38:02.489
What?

38:03.114 --> 38:04.240
What do you mean?

38:05.617 --> 38:07.660
What do you mean,
he had my name?

38:07.869 --> 38:10.580
The same as you and your dad:
Daniel Molina.

38:10.789 --> 38:12.332
What don't you understand?

38:18.463 --> 38:19.380
Get up.

38:21.633 --> 38:23.843
He forgets how to walk. Come on!

38:28.973 --> 38:31.810
Hello, we're leaving him
at the 40-km marker.

38:32.018 --> 38:35.271
At a railroad crossing.

38:35.480 --> 38:37.440
He's still sleeping.

38:37.690 --> 38:40.109
We gave him medication for stress.

38:40.693 --> 38:42.362
I told you we'd be honest.

38:42.612 --> 38:45.448
If you're honest, we're honest.

38:47.075 --> 38:49.118
Find me another phone.
He gave me another lead.

38:49.285 --> 38:51.496
But make sure
it's got internet this time.

38:52.247 --> 38:53.081
Let's go!

43:53.381 --> 43:55.091
You won't be all alone anymore.

45:08.414 --> 45:10.291
One, two, three.

46:05.554 --> 46:09.558
It's missing the cylinder
and part of the stock.

46:11.394 --> 46:12.812
I'll give you 100 pesos.

46:15.231 --> 46:16.565
A hundred and fifty.

46:17.525 --> 46:19.527
I've paid you some real cash.

46:20.361 --> 46:24.657
A hundred pesos is the price...
Okay, one hundred pesos.

46:25.283 --> 46:26.450
What's the total?

46:26.659 --> 46:28.661
The total? I'll tell you.

46:35.126 --> 46:36.669
525.

46:37.837 --> 46:39.005
If that suits you.

46:39.964 --> 46:43.259
- Fine.
- It's a deal, then.

46:49.598 --> 46:51.559
Did you know my brother Emilio?

46:51.642 --> 46:53.644
He used to come around.

46:54.895 --> 46:58.649
He was a unique guy.
Very... Solitary.

46:58.858 --> 47:02.111
But his house is full of stuff.

47:02.320 --> 47:05.448
- He used to buy. He never sold.
- Really?

47:05.781 --> 47:07.199
Why didn't he ever sell?

47:09.826 --> 47:11.370
I don't know. Go figure.

47:11.787 --> 47:12.955
I've no idea.

47:14.415 --> 47:16.833
If you want,
I'll drive over to his house

47:17.043 --> 47:19.836
- and take a look.
- Could you do that?

47:19.920 --> 47:22.715
- That'd be great.
- Sure. No problem.

47:24.383 --> 47:26.719
Are you still interested in the car?

47:27.136 --> 47:28.763
- Which car? This one?
- Yes.

47:28.845 --> 47:30.389
Are you selling it?

47:31.349 --> 47:34.185
Duarte told me you were interested.

47:34.393 --> 47:36.354
Why not?
Open the hood.

47:39.482 --> 47:40.691
Do you have the title?

47:42.068 --> 47:44.737
No, I left it in Buenos Aires.

47:45.862 --> 47:47.239
Ah, that's a shame.

47:47.907 --> 47:49.784
It's really a shame.

47:50.910 --> 47:53.662
I'll give you 14,000 pesos.

47:54.497 --> 47:55.831
No!

47:56.624 --> 47:58.542
- Listen to me.
- 14,000, no.

47:58.834 --> 48:01.629
You're bringing me
a car without a title.

48:01.837 --> 48:06.425
Take my offer or leave it,
but I'll pay you cash.

48:12.348 --> 48:14.975
- I might change my mind, you know.
- No, no.

48:15.226 --> 48:18.354
I need the car right now,
to drive to Resistencia.

48:18.562 --> 48:23.651
But if you come by tomorrow
to see the stuff at the house,

48:24.026 --> 48:26.070
- you can take it then.
- It's a deal.

48:44.755 --> 48:46.465
You little piece of shit!

48:46.674 --> 48:48.342
Dirty faggot! Son of a bitch!

48:48.968 --> 48:52.555
Get me out of here! Help!

48:52.805 --> 48:53.764
I've been kidnapped!

48:53.930 --> 48:57.685
Go fuck yourself, you bastard!
I'll kick your fucking ass!

48:57.893 --> 49:00.020
Rotten son of a bitch!

49:00.271 --> 49:03.315
Get me out
of this fucking hole, you prick!

49:03.524 --> 49:07.111
Motherfucker!
Pile of shit! Scumbag!

49:07.361 --> 49:10.781
Who the fuck are you?
The guy who fucks this faggot?

49:13.159 --> 49:14.577
You know who I am?

49:14.910 --> 49:18.038
The guy who beats the shit
out of you if you don't cooperate.

49:18.831 --> 49:21.333
Stop feeding her, just to see.

49:23.002 --> 49:27.173
I don't want to hear you breathe.
Got that?

49:28.591 --> 49:30.050
Answer me!

49:44.981 --> 49:46.150
Do as you're told.

49:46.609 --> 49:50.571
If your son does his part too,
nothing bad will happen.

50:00.706 --> 50:02.625
They always wet themselves.

50:09.465 --> 50:10.508
Wait.

50:11.717 --> 50:14.220
Those things...

50:15.095 --> 50:16.472
They're people!

50:19.015 --> 50:21.894
I'm not buying people. They're yours.

50:22.061 --> 50:23.437
Sorry. Excuse me.

50:24.980 --> 50:26.190
I forgot about them.

50:46.377 --> 50:50.506
Load up the extinguishers next.

50:58.347 --> 50:59.974
We have your mother.

51:05.061 --> 51:08.649
Come up with 300,000 pesos,
or you never see her again.

51:14.363 --> 51:17.408
Don't play the fool with me.
Find the money.

51:17.616 --> 51:18.993
I'll call you back.

51:23.372 --> 51:24.790
I know you do.

51:25.624 --> 51:26.875
Look hard for it.

51:32.798 --> 51:34.633
I'm not joking.

51:35.050 --> 51:36.594
If you don't find the money,

51:36.802 --> 51:40.806
next time you see your mother,
she'll be in a trash bag.

51:48.022 --> 51:49.732
What's wrong with the dogs?

51:51.859 --> 51:52.818
What did he say?

51:54.570 --> 51:57.197
He says he doesn't have the money,

51:57.948 --> 51:59.283
but I know he does.

52:00.326 --> 52:02.077
I heard about it from...

52:02.995 --> 52:04.079
Who?

52:05.080 --> 52:06.707
The buyer of the tractor!

52:11.086 --> 52:14.006
Okay, I have stuff to do.

52:18.177 --> 52:19.553
Watch that old lady.

52:19.803 --> 52:20.929
She's a sly one.

52:43.702 --> 52:44.662
Let go of me!

52:47.581 --> 52:48.832
Let go!

52:56.465 --> 52:57.716
Goddamn it to hell!

52:58.550 --> 53:00.176
What's wrong with you?
Fucking shit.

53:13.899 --> 53:14.817
Hurry up.

53:15.067 --> 53:18.194
Go fetch me the antiseptic
and the gauze.

53:40.551 --> 53:41.552
What happened?

53:42.010 --> 53:43.345
I was feeding them,

53:43.929 --> 53:45.431
and they jumped me.

53:46.348 --> 53:49.101
I fought them off
with an iron rod.

53:49.643 --> 53:52.771
It worked on the first dog,
but not the second one.

53:55.733 --> 53:58.277
Don't the pills
calm them down anymore?

53:58.777 --> 54:00.612
They must have a tolerance now.

54:01.405 --> 54:03.615
They're just like humans.

54:04.324 --> 54:09.163
- I told you to increase the dose.
- I gave them all that I had.

54:12.291 --> 54:13.125
Weird.

54:13.292 --> 54:16.128
Those pills of Duarte's
must be phony.

54:16.336 --> 54:18.130
God knows where he gets them.

54:26.305 --> 54:28.849
Duarte says it was wrong of you

54:29.183 --> 54:31.769
to make me open my brother's grave.

54:34.730 --> 54:38.817
Who the hell is he,
to tell me what's wrong or right?

54:43.697 --> 54:45.783
Why did you give me the same name?

54:46.450 --> 54:50.245
The firstborn son is always
named for the father.

54:52.956 --> 54:54.625
But I wasn't born first.

54:55.250 --> 54:57.711
You're the first,
because the other died.

55:00.339 --> 55:02.716
With my own name, I'd be better.

55:02.925 --> 55:04.635
You're talking nonsense.

55:08.263 --> 55:11.683
Duarte said
you were in bad shape,

55:13.018 --> 55:16.814
and that's why papa let you
give me the same name.

55:17.022 --> 55:18.982
Your father didn't know how I was.

55:19.191 --> 55:22.486
He came around when he pleased.
I was alone at your birth.

55:22.945 --> 55:25.489
He'd write me from TucumÃ¡n

55:25.781 --> 55:30.035
to tell me bullshit about his asthma,
and about mosquitoes.

55:31.161 --> 55:33.747
He didn't come home
when his son died.

55:33.956 --> 55:35.290
His first son.

55:36.375 --> 55:37.626
He only saw him once.

55:37.835 --> 55:39.253
He wasn't at the burial.

55:42.089 --> 55:43.757
Duarte says you did something.

55:47.678 --> 55:48.637
What is it?

55:50.639 --> 55:52.558
What does Duarte say? What?

55:53.016 --> 55:54.059
What?

55:57.104 --> 55:58.981
Nobody has the right
to preach to me

56:00.649 --> 56:02.192
about right or wrong.

56:04.820 --> 56:06.697
It was sheer hell, for months.

56:07.322 --> 56:11.910
He was a scrawny infant
with a huge head and wrinkled eyes.

56:12.911 --> 56:16.415
I had to give him injections.
He was in constant pain,

56:16.665 --> 56:18.458
my first son, in constant pain.

56:20.168 --> 56:22.796
Anyone else
would have been relieved

56:23.171 --> 56:25.215
when he died, but for me,

56:25.507 --> 56:29.136
it was like having my liver
ripped out of my body.

56:30.053 --> 56:32.764
I stayed there, alone,
in the scorching sun,

56:33.557 --> 56:35.475
while the guy buried him.

56:37.603 --> 56:40.439
While your father
was playing soldiers.

56:51.366 --> 56:53.368
Look in the dresser drawer.

57:01.793 --> 57:03.629
It was at your father's.

57:06.381 --> 57:07.925
I can't kill them.
It's too hard.

57:08.008 --> 57:09.635
They were my puppies.

57:13.972 --> 57:15.849
I'll take it, but...

57:16.433 --> 57:18.769
I don't think I'll kill them.

58:08.276 --> 58:09.444
I kept my word.

58:09.653 --> 58:12.447
How long did I say?
A few days.

58:12.614 --> 58:14.032
How long has it been?

58:15.033 --> 58:16.326
A few days.

58:18.453 --> 58:20.372
What's he giving you for the car?

58:21.540 --> 58:24.001
- 14,000.
- He's cheating you.

58:24.501 --> 58:25.836
It's enough.

58:26.628 --> 58:29.423
Give me a few days,
and I'll find you a bargain

58:29.589 --> 58:31.466
to drive back to Buenos Aires.

58:32.050 --> 58:34.636
I'm not sure
I'm going back to Buenos Aires.

58:34.886 --> 58:36.680
No commitments there?

58:37.431 --> 58:40.600
The only commitment I have
is to pay the rent.

58:41.560 --> 58:44.688
So, I'd rather save the money.

58:45.355 --> 58:48.150
I'll stay here until everything is sold,
at least.

58:48.817 --> 58:50.569
In this shitty little burg?

58:51.278 --> 58:54.031
This shitty little burg
is closer to Brazil.

58:54.239 --> 58:57.117
Between the insurance money
and the sales,

58:57.325 --> 58:58.660
I'll have enough to go.

58:59.369 --> 59:02.122
We're here
for an army life-insurance settlement.

59:02.330 --> 59:03.915
Very good. The name, please?

59:04.458 --> 59:06.710
- Javier Cetarti.
- Your ID, please?

59:07.502 --> 59:09.337
- ID card.
- Yes.

59:16.303 --> 59:17.596
32,000?

59:19.014 --> 59:19.931
Right.

59:50.504 --> 59:51.880
Swallow this pill.

01:00:12.776 --> 01:00:15.278
I've told you not to come here.

01:00:16.822 --> 01:00:17.823
I'm going.

01:00:19.241 --> 01:00:21.326
I want you
to quit seeing Duarte.

01:00:21.701 --> 01:00:24.663
I took the dogs' pills,
and ate rat poison.

01:00:25.288 --> 01:00:26.581
I'm going to burst.

01:00:36.299 --> 01:00:38.593
Kill these dogs. They're mean.

01:00:46.101 --> 01:00:47.060
There.

01:00:48.145 --> 01:00:49.813
This is the 12,000 for you.

01:00:50.772 --> 01:00:53.775
I'll put it
in the glove compartment, separate.

01:00:55.861 --> 01:00:58.864
That leaves 12,000 in there for me

01:00:59.823 --> 01:01:01.783
and 8,000 to pay off the buzzards.

01:01:02.033 --> 01:01:03.869
- Is that okay?
- It's perfect.

01:01:06.079 --> 01:01:07.831
What the hell does he want?

01:01:08.498 --> 01:01:11.751
I couldn't answer.
I was at the bank. What's up?

01:01:13.837 --> 01:01:14.796
What?

01:01:18.758 --> 01:01:20.552
That fucking bitch!

01:01:26.016 --> 01:01:27.851
What a rotten woman...

01:01:28.852 --> 01:01:30.353
Sorry to say this,

01:01:31.229 --> 01:01:33.273
but she'd be better off dead.

01:01:34.024 --> 01:01:38.695
If she's only paralyzed, she'll need
spoon-feeding, wiping...

01:01:38.778 --> 01:01:40.697
She doesn't like you much, either.

01:01:42.532 --> 01:01:45.827
She says my father
was a good guy, before.

01:01:47.454 --> 01:01:48.663
Before what?

01:01:50.332 --> 01:01:53.585
Before he met you.
She says you were a bad influence.

01:01:54.419 --> 01:01:57.714
Now he's a saint and I'm a bastard?

01:01:58.882 --> 01:02:01.092
Didn't she fuck up her own life?

01:02:02.469 --> 01:02:07.140
A foreigner slut, that had two kids,
one of them sickly...

01:02:10.685 --> 01:02:11.603
And you?

01:02:15.315 --> 01:02:17.776
What are you looking at?
Hold this.

01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:22.364
I'm calling the son.
We're safe here.

01:02:23.907 --> 01:02:27.160
She's in a coma.
She won't remember this.

01:02:28.119 --> 01:02:29.704
I'll be right back.

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:37.087
Hello.
Have you found the money yet?

01:02:40.632 --> 01:02:41.675
What can you offer?

01:02:46.721 --> 01:02:49.641
Don't lie to me.
I know you came into some money.

01:02:54.938 --> 01:02:56.314
You're lying. Asshole.

01:02:56.564 --> 01:02:59.401
I didn't say you sold.
Get that money by tomorrow,

01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:02.737
or you'll see your mom
with a broomstick up her ass

01:03:02.946 --> 01:03:04.948
and a bullet in her neck.
Got it?

01:03:15.083 --> 01:03:18.378
Unbelievable,
this asshole wants to keep the money.

01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:22.590
What a prick.
He doesn't give a fuck about her!

01:03:25.802 --> 01:03:28.680
Let's go.
We can't do her any good.

01:03:28.847 --> 01:03:31.474
I don't want
to leave the old lady alone.

01:03:31.891 --> 01:03:33.601
Got any weed?

01:03:36.229 --> 01:03:38.023
That's all you think about!

01:03:38.773 --> 01:03:41.151
Can't you wait a week?

01:03:48.825 --> 01:03:51.036
Maybe I'll get some this weekend.

01:04:06.301 --> 01:04:08.762
Sorry, I thought
it would go more quickly.

01:04:08.928 --> 01:04:10.680
- Is that her son?
- Yes...

01:04:11.348 --> 01:04:12.974
Daniel, Javier,

01:04:13.308 --> 01:04:15.518
this is your half-brother.

01:04:16.895 --> 01:04:20.231
He's the son of your father's wife.

01:04:21.024 --> 01:04:22.275
The one who died.

01:04:22.817 --> 01:04:26.154
- Another son?
- Yes, he's the brother

01:04:26.404 --> 01:04:27.781
of the other victim.

01:04:28.865 --> 01:04:31.409
Your other half-brother. Understand?

01:04:33.328 --> 01:04:35.080
- How's your mother?
- Not well.

01:04:35.330 --> 01:04:36.414
She's half dead.

01:04:36.623 --> 01:04:38.625
She won't last the night.

01:05:26.339 --> 01:05:28.049
Did you talk to my son?

01:05:28.425 --> 01:05:30.677
He said he didn't have any money.

01:05:42.856 --> 01:05:43.731
Hello.

01:05:46.234 --> 01:05:47.444
Yes, it's me.

01:06:03.001 --> 01:06:04.711
Who is it? My son?

01:06:05.503 --> 01:06:08.423
Is it my son?

01:06:11.092 --> 01:06:12.093
Excellent.

01:06:19.893 --> 01:06:21.144
He'll cremate her.

01:06:23.813 --> 01:06:27.108
Saves you the burial,
and all that crap.

01:06:27.358 --> 01:06:29.944
Plus, I'll find you
a life-insurance settlement

01:06:30.153 --> 01:06:32.780
so you get money
from the air force.

01:06:32.947 --> 01:06:35.116
- Can you?
- Or a pension.

01:06:35.366 --> 01:06:37.952
Even better, money every month.

01:06:39.162 --> 01:06:41.080
I'll figure out how to do it.

01:06:41.581 --> 01:06:42.415
Okay.

01:06:43.333 --> 01:06:44.417
Back to work!

01:06:55.512 --> 01:06:57.472
I'll give you 1,500 pesos.

01:06:58.765 --> 01:06:59.766
1,500?

01:07:01.476 --> 01:07:02.894
For all of this?

01:07:03.061 --> 01:07:05.021
Everything, inside and out...

01:07:05.230 --> 01:07:09.025
- 1,500 for it all.
- Right...

01:07:09.234 --> 01:07:10.777
Plus the car.

01:07:10.985 --> 01:07:11.986
I want 3,000.

01:07:13.196 --> 01:07:15.657
I'm doing you a favour,
hauling this junk,

01:07:15.907 --> 01:07:17.992
cleaning up the house.

01:07:18.201 --> 01:07:19.369
No, 3,000.

01:07:26.501 --> 01:07:28.002
No. You're dreaming!

01:07:28.211 --> 01:07:29.671
I can't.

01:07:33.174 --> 01:07:35.051
I'd rather just put it outside.

01:07:38.346 --> 01:07:42.058
Good. I'll come by with the truck
and pick it all up.

01:07:44.644 --> 01:07:46.229
I'll burn everything.

01:07:47.772 --> 01:07:49.023
I will burn it.

01:08:01.911 --> 01:08:04.497
You hang out with Duarte
too much.

01:08:15.466 --> 01:08:18.219
Here.
That's 14,000.

01:08:22.849 --> 01:08:24.058
Plus 3,000.

01:08:29.188 --> 01:08:30.064
Good.

01:08:32.317 --> 01:08:35.653
- Give me the keys.
- The keys to the car.

01:08:49.459 --> 01:08:51.210
Careful with that thing.

01:08:51.586 --> 01:08:54.296
Don't put it on top.
Everything will fall down.

01:08:55.506 --> 01:08:57.466
- The key.
- Holy fucking shit!

01:08:59.010 --> 01:09:00.636
You don't give a fuck
about them!

01:09:00.845 --> 01:09:03.848
- Don't put that in my face.
- I'm sorry...

01:09:06.017 --> 01:09:07.268
I forgot about them.

01:09:08.519 --> 01:09:10.479
I'll be okay. Don't worry.

01:09:11.939 --> 01:09:13.066
No big deal.

01:09:13.232 --> 01:09:14.734
Can I ask you something?

01:09:14.984 --> 01:09:17.111
Sure. Actually, it depends.

01:09:17.528 --> 01:09:21.823
It's just about your limp.
Did you have an accident?

01:09:22.033 --> 01:09:25.243
No, it's a childhood defect,
a birth defect.

01:09:25.495 --> 01:09:30.207
Apparently, when my mother
decided to have me,

01:09:30.457 --> 01:09:35.462
this part was only half-baked,
so to speak.

01:09:36.464 --> 01:09:39.676
It's a good thing
that didn't happen

01:09:40.801 --> 01:09:43.805
to a more essential limb!

01:09:45.305 --> 01:09:46.307
Well, all right.

01:09:47.308 --> 01:09:48.350
See you later.

01:09:49.227 --> 01:09:50.228
Chico!

01:09:50.478 --> 01:09:52.188
You pull out first!

01:09:52.814 --> 01:09:55.733
Drive slowly. I'll follow.
We're going home.

01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:46.576
Stop.

01:10:47.326 --> 01:10:48.786
Turn off the headlights.

01:10:52.665 --> 01:10:54.625
What the fuck is going on?

01:11:01.924 --> 01:11:03.092
Go see what's up.

01:12:11.369 --> 01:12:12.745
Go ahead.

01:12:38.437 --> 01:12:39.897
Open up!

01:13:02.545 --> 01:13:03.379
What happened?

01:13:03.588 --> 01:13:07.008
A neighbour reported
our dogs were barking.

01:13:07.925 --> 01:13:10.428
I told the cops
the dogs were just hungry.

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:12.221
So the cops left.

01:13:12.388 --> 01:13:15.308
God damn those dogs!
Did you lock them in?

01:13:15.933 --> 01:13:16.851
Yes.

01:13:18.811 --> 01:13:19.562
And now,

01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:21.814
what are you doing?

01:13:24.025 --> 01:13:25.693
Did you find me some weed?

01:13:26.485 --> 01:13:28.321
Calm down!

01:13:29.614 --> 01:13:33.034
We get rid of the old lady,
and I'll find you a half kilo.

01:14:49.944 --> 01:14:51.445
Great. You're awake.

01:14:53.781 --> 01:14:55.783
Shall I tell you where we're at?

01:14:57.827 --> 01:14:59.537
Your son says he's broke,

01:15:01.622 --> 01:15:04.083
and since you've made me
waste so much time,

01:15:05.960 --> 01:15:07.795
I have to get some profit back.

01:15:28.941 --> 01:15:31.027
I'm going to fuck you,

01:15:31.652 --> 01:15:33.320
fuck you to death.

01:15:35.573 --> 01:15:39.326
We have money!

01:15:41.537 --> 01:15:44.331
We do have money.

01:15:46.125 --> 01:15:48.210
I was pretty sure you did!

01:15:48.419 --> 01:15:50.254
From selling a tractor.

01:15:54.008 --> 01:15:57.136
Your son wants me to kill you
so he can keep the money.

01:15:58.262 --> 01:16:00.056
Tell him to give it to you!

01:16:00.556 --> 01:16:02.725
- I did. He doesn't want to.
- No!

01:16:02.975 --> 01:16:04.602
He doesn't give a damn about you.

01:16:04.852 --> 01:16:07.146
- Let go of me!
- He leaves me no choice.

01:16:07.354 --> 01:16:11.358
I can't keep you,
and freeing you is too risky.

01:16:11.525 --> 01:16:12.860
- Tell him...
- Imagine it.

01:16:13.069 --> 01:16:17.156
Tell him to give you the money,
I beg you!

01:16:25.873 --> 01:16:29.168
I'll make one more call,
but it's the last time.

01:16:52.191 --> 01:16:55.111
-  Hello.
- Honey, this is Mama!

01:16:56.153 --> 01:16:57.279
Got the money?

01:16:57.488 --> 01:17:00.157
I told you, I'm broke.

01:17:00.825 --> 01:17:03.577
Funny, your mother says
you sold a tractor.

01:17:03.786 --> 01:17:05.579
Give him the money, please!

01:17:05.830 --> 01:17:09.291
Son, son, I'm begging you!

01:17:09.542 --> 01:17:11.919
- They'll kill me!
- Can't you talk?

01:17:12.378 --> 01:17:14.672
What money? What tractor?

01:17:14.964 --> 01:17:18.926
Quique, it's Mama.
Give him the money, or he'll kill me.

01:17:19.468 --> 01:17:22.221
- Can't you answer her?
- My boy,

01:17:22.429 --> 01:17:24.723
pay him the money,
or he'll kill me!

01:17:24.807 --> 01:17:25.766
My boy, my boy...

01:17:25.850 --> 01:17:28.352
I don't know where to get it.

01:17:41.574 --> 01:17:43.534
I'll give you the money.

01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:48.539
I'll give it to you.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.668
I'll give you the money.

01:17:52.751 --> 01:17:54.461
Now we're getting somewhere.

01:18:00.801 --> 01:18:02.511
But I've got a hard-on.

01:18:30.539 --> 01:18:32.666
Can't you fight back a little?

01:18:33.667 --> 01:18:35.753
It's no fun this way.

01:18:38.672 --> 01:18:39.673
You,

01:18:40.007 --> 01:18:41.759
you love this.

01:18:43.928 --> 01:18:45.221
You can't get enough!

01:18:49.934 --> 01:18:51.101
What a slut.

01:19:02.363 --> 01:19:03.155
Hello.

01:19:03.364 --> 01:19:05.157
-  Cetarti?
- Yes.

01:19:05.366 --> 01:19:07.952
-  Duarte.
- Yes.

01:19:08.702 --> 01:19:10.704
Sorry, did I wake you up?

01:19:10.913 --> 01:19:12.915
Yeah, but it's okay.

01:19:13.415 --> 01:19:14.792
- What's up?
-  Listen,

01:19:15.084 --> 01:19:18.337
I want you to do me a favour.
You owe me one.

01:19:18.545 --> 01:19:20.256
I'll pay you well for it.

01:19:21.632 --> 01:19:23.509
What do I have to do?

01:19:23.968 --> 01:19:26.679
I want you to put us up,
Danielito and me,

01:19:26.845 --> 01:19:29.556
and my sick aunt, tonight.

01:19:32.059 --> 01:19:33.936
I'm still asleep, I don't get it.

01:19:34.186 --> 01:19:35.688
You don't get it?

01:19:35.896 --> 01:19:38.607
There's 5,000 in it for you,
do you get it now?

01:19:39.108 --> 01:19:43.362
It's just that I don't want
any trouble, that's all.

01:19:46.156 --> 01:19:47.408
10,000?

01:19:50.411 --> 01:19:51.203
Okay.

01:19:51.870 --> 01:19:53.789
But I don't have a bed.

01:19:54.248 --> 01:19:56.458
No big deal. Just help us out.

01:19:59.503 --> 01:20:01.255
What time are you coming?

01:20:01.755 --> 01:20:03.841
We'll be there in an hour, max.

01:20:04.758 --> 01:20:05.551
Bye.

01:21:14.536 --> 01:21:15.329
Hello.

01:21:15.537 --> 01:21:18.040
Hello. How are you?
We're here.

01:21:19.375 --> 01:21:22.044
We're out back.
Come open the door.

01:21:30.469 --> 01:21:33.055
This is my aunt. She has Alzheimer's.

01:21:33.305 --> 01:21:36.433
I give her sedatives
because she self-harms.

01:21:38.102 --> 01:21:39.645
Open this side for me.

01:21:47.778 --> 01:21:50.197
The house is nice and tidy now!

01:21:51.323 --> 01:21:54.576
You got rid of the junk?
Was it worth anything?

01:21:55.786 --> 01:21:57.538
It looks like a real home.

01:22:00.541 --> 01:22:01.959
Put her in the bedroom.

01:22:15.973 --> 01:22:16.890
Sit down.

01:22:27.651 --> 01:22:28.652
10,000.

01:22:31.530 --> 01:22:32.614
Thanks.

01:22:37.494 --> 01:22:39.913
Tomorrow, you have to come with us,

01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:42.875
when we take my aunt to the bank.

01:22:48.422 --> 01:22:50.716
I'll give you another 10,000.

01:22:56.513 --> 01:22:59.600
You want 25? It's yours.
How much do you want?

01:22:59.975 --> 01:23:03.854
Want to go to Brazil?
With 25,000, you cover the cost.

01:23:05.606 --> 01:23:08.859
You're asking me to go with you,

01:23:09.193 --> 01:23:12.404
with your aunt who has Alzheimer's,

01:23:12.988 --> 01:23:14.907
who is in a wheelchair,

01:23:15.073 --> 01:23:16.617
all the way to Resistencia,

01:23:17.117 --> 01:23:19.870
to take money out of the bank.

01:23:20.829 --> 01:23:22.414
Easy as pie!

01:23:23.207 --> 01:23:24.750
For 25,000 pesos.

01:23:33.509 --> 01:23:34.510
Thanks.

01:23:36.136 --> 01:23:38.388
He's old, from the size of him.

01:23:38.764 --> 01:23:39.848
Had him long?

01:23:42.309 --> 01:23:43.477
He was here

01:23:43.727 --> 01:23:45.729
when I moved in.

01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:48.982
Do you give him live food?

01:23:49.149 --> 01:23:51.401
I give him salami, he likes that.

01:23:52.444 --> 01:23:54.988
Bad idea. You're going to kill him.

01:23:55.989 --> 01:23:58.784
He needs live food.
Worms.

01:24:00.327 --> 01:24:02.829
And he should be in the dark.

01:24:03.622 --> 01:24:06.542
They don't like the sun.
It stresses them out.

01:24:07.042 --> 01:24:08.001
Amazing,

01:24:08.710 --> 01:24:10.796
I had it all wrong.

01:24:11.797 --> 01:24:13.966
- Do you have one?
- No.

01:24:14.716 --> 01:24:17.052
But I watch the documentaries on TV.

01:24:18.136 --> 01:24:19.471
I do, too.

01:24:20.514 --> 01:24:22.391
You really are brothers!

01:24:23.892 --> 01:24:25.519
Half-brothers, anyway.

01:24:27.479 --> 01:24:28.981
I watch those things too,

01:24:29.690 --> 01:24:31.942
but for some reason,
I forget it all.

01:24:32.109 --> 01:24:36.905
He remembers all that stuff.
He's a walking encyclopaedia.

01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:41.785
One of these days,
I'll get you on a quiz show.

01:24:41.994 --> 01:24:46.456
At least you'd make some money,
with all your useless facts!

01:24:55.507 --> 01:24:56.800
Got some smoke?

01:25:23.076 --> 01:25:24.745
These magazines are cool.

01:25:26.330 --> 01:25:28.665
Yeah, I have a whole pile of them.

01:25:29.041 --> 01:25:33.086
They're about Brazil.
Do you want to see them?

01:25:33.295 --> 01:25:34.129
Sure.

01:25:34.588 --> 01:25:36.340
I'll go get them.

01:25:45.849 --> 01:25:46.892
What a fright!

01:25:47.100 --> 01:25:49.227
Why do you keep the urns there?

01:25:49.519 --> 01:25:51.104
What were you looking for?

01:25:51.647 --> 01:25:52.981
Yerba matÃ©. Got any?

01:25:54.941 --> 01:25:55.734
No.

01:25:56.443 --> 01:25:57.819
Damn. What a shame.

01:25:58.153 --> 01:25:59.655
I could use a cup of matÃ©.

01:25:59.946 --> 01:26:02.699
Did you sell it all?
Everything here?

01:26:04.034 --> 01:26:04.826
Yes.

01:26:05.285 --> 01:26:06.828
Didn't you find anything?

01:26:07.704 --> 01:26:09.122
No. Like what?

01:26:10.332 --> 01:26:11.792
I don't know, anything.

01:26:12.042 --> 01:26:15.128
Something valuable
in the middle of the mess.

01:26:15.671 --> 01:26:17.005
A treasure, or keepsake.

01:26:37.109 --> 01:26:38.193
Brazil...

01:26:38.485 --> 01:26:41.405
They say the northern part is nice.
Is that true?

01:26:42.572 --> 01:26:45.701
MaceiÃ³'s supposed to be incredible.

01:26:45.909 --> 01:26:48.203
And Fernando de Noronha.

01:26:50.580 --> 01:26:52.165
It's an island, isn't it?

01:26:53.375 --> 01:26:55.919
It's the biggest island
of an archipelago

01:26:56.128 --> 01:26:59.673
220 miles offshore,
in the middle of the Atlantic.

01:26:59.881 --> 01:27:01.341
You get there from Recife.

01:27:02.509 --> 01:27:05.053
There's a maximum-security jail there.

01:27:06.346 --> 01:27:08.932
200 miles from land, the bastards!

01:27:09.141 --> 01:27:11.393
They stick a prison in the ocean.

01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:15.772
Even if you manage to escape,
you won't get very far.

01:27:17.190 --> 01:27:18.024
Swimming.

01:27:18.233 --> 01:27:19.568
You're stuck.

01:27:19.943 --> 01:27:22.446
Plus, the waters are shark-infested.

01:27:24.531 --> 01:27:26.199
Once, I saw on TV

01:27:26.408 --> 01:27:30.579
that when they expelled the Gypsies
and Capoeira dancers,

01:27:31.329 --> 01:27:32.622
they sent them there.

01:27:32.998 --> 01:27:34.708
What a shitty thing to do!

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.836
What harm
is a little dancing monkey?

01:27:38.044 --> 01:27:40.005
They've founded a nature reserve.

01:27:40.213 --> 01:27:41.631
I want to go there.

01:27:43.300 --> 01:27:44.885
Does it cost much to go?

01:27:45.635 --> 01:27:48.847
I don't know,
but from here in northern Argentina,

01:27:49.222 --> 01:27:50.724
I can continue by land

01:27:50.974 --> 01:27:54.352
and take a boat or plane
just for the last leg.

01:27:55.353 --> 01:27:57.439
Cigarette boat, straight there.

01:27:58.440 --> 01:27:59.483
With smugglers.

01:28:00.108 --> 01:28:02.944
That's doable.
It's one way to travel.

01:28:04.154 --> 01:28:05.363
It is doable.

01:28:07.449 --> 01:28:08.867
That's where I'm headed.

01:28:10.243 --> 01:28:11.411
Definitely.

01:28:17.834 --> 01:28:19.586
What the fuck is he doing?

01:28:19.961 --> 01:28:21.379
He was in the bathroom.

01:28:52.244 --> 01:28:55.789
You act like you have a date!
We're just going to the bank.

01:28:56.289 --> 01:28:58.750
I'll hit the road from there.

01:28:59.376 --> 01:29:01.503
Can we go
to the bus terminal, after?

01:29:01.753 --> 01:29:03.004
Sure. Let's go!

01:29:03.213 --> 01:29:05.757
I'll drop you off. Come help me!

01:29:07.050 --> 01:29:09.302
One, two, three!

01:29:13.306 --> 01:29:17.644
You ride with her.
Keep her from getting bumped.

01:29:18.103 --> 01:29:21.857
Don't listen to her.
She's half crazy. Deluded.

01:29:22.274 --> 01:29:23.316
Go ahead, hop in!

01:30:30.508 --> 01:30:31.384
Here we are!

01:30:52.614 --> 01:30:54.532
You'd better behave yourself,

01:30:54.783 --> 01:30:58.203
or I'll make mincemeat out of you
with my bare hands.

01:30:58.411 --> 01:30:59.245
Good.

01:31:00.121 --> 01:31:02.791
Stay with her.
She's a little bit crazy.

01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:04.417
We're off!

01:31:05.210 --> 01:31:07.671
The papers are in her handbag.

01:31:25.146 --> 01:31:27.524
We have to be on top alert.

01:31:28.233 --> 01:31:31.569
At the slightest sign of trouble,
we take off.

01:31:35.031 --> 01:31:38.451
I tell you we're on top alert,
and you light up a joint!

01:32:32.714 --> 01:32:34.007
Why'd we bring him?

01:32:36.509 --> 01:32:38.344
You're asking me why?

01:32:38.970 --> 01:32:39.971
You have no idea?

01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:44.642
I'll give you two reasons.

01:32:45.185 --> 01:32:48.396
For one thing,
nobody knows him.

01:32:48.730 --> 01:32:51.524
If the old lady balks,
we make a run for it.

01:32:52.942 --> 01:32:57.322
But I don't think she will.
She's no dummy. She won't dare.

01:33:00.992 --> 01:33:02.243
And the second reason?

01:33:03.453 --> 01:33:06.206
The second
is that you'd be incapable.

01:33:06.790 --> 01:33:09.959
Me too, and if I show my face,
I'm a goner.

01:33:10.168 --> 01:33:11.711
The end of the business.

01:33:14.297 --> 01:33:16.424
There are CCTV cameras all over.

01:33:17.133 --> 01:33:20.428
Whose face will be
on those surveillance videos?

01:33:21.971 --> 01:33:24.724
Not mine. It'll be his face.

01:33:51.417 --> 01:33:52.418
Auntie.

01:34:08.434 --> 01:34:11.104
Look straight ahead, okay?

01:34:12.814 --> 01:34:14.357
I'll get out your ID.

01:34:21.156 --> 01:34:22.699
Wait a moment, please.

01:34:23.199 --> 01:34:24.742
You may go ahead, sir.

01:34:25.535 --> 01:34:26.578
Fine.

01:34:38.298 --> 01:34:39.632
We're making a withdrawal.

01:34:40.049 --> 01:34:41.176
May I see your ID?

01:34:52.103 --> 01:34:54.981
- How much?
- All of it, I think.

01:35:03.615 --> 01:35:05.241
All of it, she says.

01:35:12.081 --> 01:35:15.376
300,455.50?

01:35:21.174 --> 01:35:24.260
Sign the slip.
I'll be right back.

01:35:41.778 --> 01:35:45.073
How much are you paying him?
More than you pay me.

01:35:47.492 --> 01:35:49.285
You really are a jackass!

01:35:50.119 --> 01:35:53.373
I'm not going to give him
a damn thing, you fool!

01:35:53.581 --> 01:35:55.625
After this,
we go to the technology park

01:35:55.792 --> 01:35:59.254
and we off them both,
him and the old lady.

01:36:03.174 --> 01:36:05.551
Understand? Or not?

01:36:08.263 --> 01:36:11.057
Let's see if your mother's death
makes you grow.

01:36:11.266 --> 01:36:15.061
And not regress,
become even lower.

01:36:20.191 --> 01:36:21.734
Where is this brother from?

01:36:23.069 --> 01:36:24.904
He's not from here.
Where's he from?

01:36:25.697 --> 01:36:29.075
Buenos Aires.
He came for the insurance money.

01:36:29.284 --> 01:36:31.828
He's not your brother.
He's your half-brother.

01:36:35.415 --> 01:36:37.250
Why are you looking
at me that way?

01:36:37.917 --> 01:36:41.379
I have to recover the debt
your father owed me.

01:36:41.713 --> 01:36:44.507
And you'll get
insurance money too.

01:36:44.882 --> 01:36:46.217
Like I said.

01:36:47.677 --> 01:36:50.305
You're the one
he owed that money to?

01:36:51.139 --> 01:36:52.181
He was nuts.

01:36:52.806 --> 01:36:56.352
- Drunk all the time.
- Wait a sec. What did you say?

01:36:57.020 --> 01:37:00.148
You say he was nuts?
He was an asshole.

01:37:01.566 --> 01:37:05.695
He never paid back the money.
And he had plenty!

01:37:05.862 --> 01:37:08.906
He couldn't say no to me,
so he said it had been stolen.

01:37:09.157 --> 01:37:12.660
I don't give a shit if it was stolen.
It was my money!

01:38:15.848 --> 01:38:18.851
Could you change these,
and give me large bills?

01:38:19.018 --> 01:38:19.852
Yes.

01:38:26.192 --> 01:38:28.569
What the hell
is taking him so long?

01:38:28.778 --> 01:38:30.822
- Maybe he caught on.
- What?

01:38:31.030 --> 01:38:32.407
Your plan to kill him.

01:38:32.615 --> 01:38:35.868
He'll never catch on.
He's a loser, like his brother.

01:38:46.796 --> 01:38:48.589
They're done. Here they come.

01:39:05.481 --> 01:39:06.691
Everything went fine?

01:39:07.483 --> 01:39:08.526
Where's the dough?

01:39:09.068 --> 01:39:10.278
In her handbag.

01:39:11.612 --> 01:39:13.448
- Okay, let's go.
- And what...

01:39:14.490 --> 01:39:16.868
- What do we do now?
- What do you mean?

01:39:17.326 --> 01:39:18.494
For the money?

01:39:19.287 --> 01:39:21.622
Don't you want a ride
to the bus terminal?

01:39:23.124 --> 01:39:25.251
I can count out your money here.

01:39:27.128 --> 01:39:28.671
But there, it's better.

01:39:32.800 --> 01:39:34.927
No, please, I beg you.

01:39:35.678 --> 01:39:37.971
- I beg you!
- One, two, three!

01:39:39.390 --> 01:39:42.018
Bastard.

01:39:46.606 --> 01:39:47.440
Careful of her.

01:40:12.173 --> 01:40:13.216
How much is there?

01:40:13.966 --> 01:40:14.884
A bundle.

01:40:16.009 --> 01:40:18.471
More than you've ever seen.

01:40:32.527 --> 01:40:34.362
And now, to the technology park.

01:41:32.753 --> 01:41:35.131
- Where are we?
- Almost there.

01:42:04.243 --> 01:42:05.244
Stop.

01:42:20.009 --> 01:42:21.927
I'm going to kill you!

01:42:39.320 --> 01:42:41.197
That hurts!

01:43:01.008 --> 01:43:02.551
What did you do to her?

01:43:04.512 --> 01:43:06.347
What did he do to the old lady?

01:43:11.184 --> 01:43:12.103
I can explain.

01:43:18.859 --> 01:43:21.904
- You wanted to kill me with this?
- She shot herself.

01:43:23.614 --> 01:43:27.034
- She shot herself.
- I should believe you?

01:43:34.166 --> 01:43:36.127
Do you think I'm an idiot?

01:43:58.399 --> 01:44:00.067
I asked you a question.

01:44:05.573 --> 01:44:07.074
Did you hear me?

01:44:07.658 --> 01:44:09.201
I asked you a question.

01:44:31.474 --> 01:44:32.933
Kill him.

01:44:38.189 --> 01:44:40.775
Hurry up!
I haven't got all day!

01:45:00.336 --> 01:45:02.171
He wanted to steal my dough.

01:45:02.755 --> 01:45:05.382
This son of a bitch
wanted to steal my dough.

01:45:06.467 --> 01:45:08.761
I must attract assholes.

01:45:09.261 --> 01:45:10.888
It's incredible!

01:45:11.889 --> 01:45:14.307
And you'd better find another job.

01:45:14.517 --> 01:45:16.143
You're no good at this.

01:45:16.309 --> 01:45:20.940
You're a loser. Go back to school.
You never should have quit school.

01:45:22.608 --> 01:45:24.902
Now, everything is paid up.

01:45:25.152 --> 01:45:26.403
We're even.

01:45:26.821 --> 01:45:27.947
Don't kill me.

01:45:28.155 --> 01:45:30.449
I maintained
your mother and you.

01:45:30.699 --> 01:45:32.117
My conscience is clear.

01:45:32.660 --> 01:45:33.661
Wait...

01:45:33.869 --> 01:45:35.538
I don't owe anyone anything.

01:45:38.331 --> 01:45:39.834
You nitwit!

01:45:40.042 --> 01:45:40.751
What's wrong?

01:46:41.353 --> 01:46:43.898
You know, when I let go,
you'll die.

01:46:51.739 --> 01:46:52.865
Sorry.

01:47:21.185 --> 01:47:23.562
I didn't see you coming,
you prick!

01:50:26.662 --> 01:50:30.582
THE END
