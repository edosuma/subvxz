11:52.795 --> 11:54.921
Little Lalita.

11:55.089 --> 11:56.631
That's kind of fun to say.

11:56.799 --> 11:59.968
Little Lalita, little Lalita, little Lalita.

12:00.136 --> 12:02.637
- You should try it.
- Oh, it's okay.

12:05.307 --> 12:07.308
You have lost so much weight.

12:08.352 --> 12:11.980
That must have been difficult for you
because you were so, so fat.

12:13.649 --> 12:14.691
Do you remember?

12:15.317 --> 12:17.318
- Yes, I do.
- Of course you do.

12:17.486 --> 12:20.196
Who could forget being that fat?

12:21.365 --> 12:22.574
Well, I've been trying.

12:23.868 --> 12:26.035
- So you're a dental student?
- Hmm.

12:26.829 --> 12:31.332
Mm! Are you aware that dentists
have an extremely high suicide rate?

12:32.168 --> 12:35.670
Not as high as air traffic controllers,
but there are far more dentists...

12:35.838 --> 12:39.507
...than air traffic controllers,
so in pure numbers, you're still winning.

12:39.675 --> 12:41.593
Yay, me.

12:42.178 --> 12:44.554
Do you have a drink
that'll make him less obnoxious?

12:45.347 --> 12:47.682
Drinks do not work that way.

12:48.476 --> 12:50.185
I'd say he's doing fine. Look at her.

12:50.352 --> 12:54.105
The last girl my mom set me up with
had a mustache and a vestigial tail.

12:56.525 --> 12:58.067
- Sorry I'm late.
- What happened?

12:58.360 --> 13:00.820
Nothing. I just really didn't wanna come.

13:02.823 --> 13:05.533
Virgin diet Cuba Libre, please.

13:05.993 --> 13:09.662
- Okay.
- In a tall glass with a lime wedge.

13:10.414 --> 13:12.874
Oh, I'll wedge it right in there.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.211
So how's Koothrappali...?

13:16.378 --> 13:17.670
Oh, my Lord.

13:17.838 --> 13:20.673
- What?
- That's Princess Panchali.

13:20.841 --> 13:22.717
I'm pretty sure her name's Lalita.

13:22.885 --> 13:27.055
No, no. Princess Panchali
from The Monkey and The Princess.

13:27.223 --> 13:31.935
Oh, yeah, I tried to watch that online
but they wanted my credit card.

13:33.062 --> 13:34.437
It's a children's story.

13:34.605 --> 13:36.564
Oh, no, it isn't.

13:39.401 --> 13:42.487
When I was a little boy and got sick,
which was most of the time...

13:42.655 --> 13:44.030
...my mother would read it.

13:44.198 --> 13:47.242
It's about an Indian princess
who befriends a monkey...

13:47.409 --> 13:50.411
...who was mocked by the other monkeys
because he was different.

13:50.579 --> 13:53.748
For some reason,
I related to it quite strongly.

13:54.208 --> 13:55.917
I know the reason.

13:56.794 --> 13:59.045
We all know the reason.

14:00.089 --> 14:01.589
Sheldon, what are you getting at?

14:01.757 --> 14:05.593
That woman looks exactly like the pictures
of Princess Panchali in the book.

14:05.970 --> 14:09.764
How often does one see a beloved
fictional character come to life?

14:09.932 --> 14:12.433
Every year at Comic-Con.

14:13.102 --> 14:14.185
Every day at Disneyland.

14:14.353 --> 14:16.896
You can hire Snow White
to come to your house.

14:17.064 --> 14:19.691
Of course, they prefer it if you have a kid.

14:20.776 --> 14:22.569
Hey, guys. This is Lalita Gupta.

14:22.736 --> 14:26.030
Lalita, this is Leonard and Sheldon
and Howard and Penny.

14:26.198 --> 14:29.158
Isn’t it great? She isn't fat anymore.

14:29.785 --> 14:31.077
Forgive me, Your Highness...

14:31.245 --> 14:33.955
...for I am but a monkey
and it is in my nature to climb.

14:34.123 --> 14:37.625
I did not mean to gaze upon you
as you comb your hair.

14:38.961 --> 14:40.211
I'm sorry?

14:40.379 --> 14:43.506
You are the living embodiment
of the beautiful Princess Panchali.

14:44.049 --> 14:47.135
Oh, no kidding. Who is that?

14:47.303 --> 14:49.888
A beloved character
from an Indian folktale.

14:50.139 --> 14:51.681
Oh.

14:51.932 --> 14:54.851
Us Indian
or "come to our casino" Indian?

14:56.812 --> 14:58.479
- You Indian.
- Oh.

14:58.814 --> 15:00.899
The resemblance is remarkable.

15:01.066 --> 15:04.485
I can practically smell the lotus blossoms
woven into your ebony hair.

15:04.862 --> 15:06.487
Well, thanks.

15:06.655 --> 15:08.990
I imagine you smell very nice too.

15:09.325 --> 15:12.994
I shower twice a day
and wash my hands as often as I can.

15:13.579 --> 15:15.330
Really? So do I.

15:15.497 --> 15:18.499
But you're a dentist, he's nuts.

15:19.543 --> 15:21.753
Don't be insulting, Rajesh.

15:21.921 --> 15:25.715
So, Sheldon, tell me more about
this princess you say I look like.

15:25.883 --> 15:29.928
It was said that the gods
fashioned her eyes out of the stars...

15:30.095 --> 15:34.098
...and that roses were ashamed to bloom
in the presence of her ruby lips.

15:34.850 --> 15:36.017
Oh, my.

15:36.185 --> 15:38.186
- Back off, Sheldon.
- What?

15:38.354 --> 15:42.690
If you do not stop hitting on my lady,
you will feel the full extent of my wrath.

15:43.525 --> 15:44.692
I'm not hitting on her.

15:45.027 --> 15:46.402
And I am not your lady.

15:46.570 --> 15:49.030
And you have no wrath.

15:50.532 --> 15:52.700
You are my lady. Our parents said so.

15:52.868 --> 15:55.370
We are, for all purposes,
100 percent hooked up.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.163
Let's get something straight.

15:57.331 --> 16:00.333
The only reason I came tonight
was to get my parents off my case.

16:00.501 --> 16:03.252
I don't need to be getting
this old-world crap from you.

16:03.420 --> 16:07.715
That's the kind of spirit with which Princess
Panchali led the monkeys to freedom.

16:07.883 --> 16:10.134
- Screw Panchali.
- You can't talk to me like that.

16:10.302 --> 16:11.844
But you're not Princess Panchali.

16:12.012 --> 16:14.389
Luckily for you.
She could have you beheaded.

16:15.224 --> 16:17.392
- Sheldon, are you hungry?
- I could eat.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.435
Let's go.

16:22.898 --> 16:23.982
What just happened?

16:24.149 --> 16:25.900
Beats the hell out of me.

16:26.068 --> 16:29.696
I'll tell you what happened. I just
learned how to pick up Indian chicks.

16:32.241 --> 16:34.659
MRS. KOOTHRAPPALI: What are we
supposed to say to Lalita's parents?

16:34.827 --> 16:37.578
I play golf with her father.
I won't be able to look at him.

16:37.746 --> 16:40.748
Maybe you should keep
your eye on the ball, Papa.

16:40.916 --> 16:45.086
Oh, now you're a funnyman?
This is not funny, Mr. Funnyman.

16:45.254 --> 16:49.465
Dr. and Mrs. Koothrappali, in all fairness,
it wasn't entirely Raj's fault.

16:49.633 --> 16:52.135
- This is a family matter, Sheldon.
- No, I'm Leonard.

16:52.386 --> 16:55.263
Oh. Sorry. You all look alike to us.

Do you have a low sperm count?

This has nothing to do
with my sperm count.

You are wearing the boxers
that we sent you, aren't you?

17:21.623 --> 17:22.665
Yes, Mommy.

about my testicles?

- What did I do?

17:33.343 --> 17:35.011
You left with his date.

- And boring. Her words.

I'm not an alcoholic.

18:00.996 --> 18:02.663

It was just this one time, Papa, I swear.
