WEBVTT

00:59.875 --> 01:01.083
Stay back!

01:01.166 --> 01:02.333
It's okay, Miriam.

01:02.416 --> 01:03.958
The guards, the theft…

01:04.041 --> 01:05.500
None of it matters.

01:05.583 --> 01:08.708
No one's going to hurt you.
You're with me now.

01:08.791 --> 01:10.708
-With your family.

01:14.875 --> 01:18.000
You killed my family,
Tevinter snake!

01:19.958 --> 01:21.041
-Come on!

01:22.708 --> 01:25.625
Focus on Miriam.
I'll handle these parasites.

01:32.458 --> 01:33.291
No!

01:57.250 --> 01:58.166
Go!

02:06.291 --> 02:07.375
Oh, boy.

02:12.125 --> 02:13.291
Surrender.

02:13.375 --> 02:14.875
I'd prefer not to kill you,

02:14.958 --> 02:15.958
but I will.

02:27.416 --> 02:28.583
Wait.

02:37.708 --> 02:39.500
Another corpse to puppet, huh?

02:49.416 --> 02:50.791
Miriam, don't!

02:54.541 --> 02:56.083
Neb, it's me.

02:57.666 --> 02:58.500
It's me.

03:05.708 --> 03:07.666
What have you done to my brother?

03:08.875 --> 03:10.708
-You bastard!
-Wait.

03:13.791 --> 03:18.583
I didn't want you to find out this way.
I'm trying to fix your mistake.

03:19.250 --> 03:20.708
I'm trying to bring him back.

03:21.333 --> 03:23.000
No!

03:29.000 --> 03:29.833
Neb!

03:39.833 --> 03:41.416
Protect the Magister!

03:48.750 --> 03:49.916
Come on, let's go!

03:52.625 --> 03:54.125
-Fire.

04:07.333 --> 04:09.083
Let's get to safety first.

04:09.166 --> 04:11.375
She's right. We have to move.

04:14.041 --> 04:17.625
Fan out, cut off every exit.
I want these thieves found now.

04:22.333 --> 04:24.875
I ordered you
to stay in The Divine's apartments.

04:24.958 --> 04:26.541
I had everything under control.

04:26.625 --> 04:29.125
Does this look like under control to you?

04:29.833 --> 04:32.041
Thieves are getting away
with a dangerous artifact,

04:32.125 --> 04:33.416
and I can't pursue them

04:33.500 --> 04:37.625
because the palace is still under siege
by its own asinine security system.

04:38.125 --> 04:41.208
And you, you were supposed
to keep him out of danger.

04:41.291 --> 04:43.833
He did, until I ordered him not to.

04:43.916 --> 04:44.833
Commander?

04:45.541 --> 04:46.791
The Circulum is gone.

04:46.875 --> 04:48.833
We surmised that already.

04:50.833 --> 04:53.750
Also, the dragon's awake,
but its chains are holding,

04:53.833 --> 04:55.625
and we recovered a prisoner.

04:56.208 --> 04:58.625
The thieves left one of their own behind.

05:00.500 --> 05:01.708
Get the thief in a cell

05:01.791 --> 05:04.416
and redirect anyone
not fighting the dead down to the vault.

05:04.500 --> 05:06.625
-We'll take care of--
-I can handle the dragon.

05:07.750 --> 05:10.833
Uh, we've, uh, cornered the corpses
in the west wing of the palace.

05:12.125 --> 05:13.958
Then get some damned mages over there.

05:14.041 --> 05:15.541
Leave the dragon to the Magister.

05:16.041 --> 05:17.000
Yes, ma'am.

05:20.916 --> 05:22.541
Who were they, the thieves?

05:23.250 --> 05:25.375
-How should I know?
-Don't play stupid.

05:25.458 --> 05:27.166
That elf had your name on her cheek.

05:28.666 --> 05:31.750
Rezaren, people died tonight
because you didn't tell me everything.

05:31.833 --> 05:33.875
I was responsible for their security.

05:33.958 --> 05:35.958
Do you understand what that means?

05:38.500 --> 05:39.625
Her name is Miriam.

05:40.458 --> 05:41.875
She's my sister.

05:44.458 --> 05:45.541
My mother owned her.

05:46.041 --> 05:51.750
She was to be my personal… spy, assassin.
Whatever was needed.

05:53.250 --> 05:54.500
My left hand, as it were.

05:56.333 --> 06:00.291
But she raised us as siblings.
Now Miriam's the only family I have left.

06:01.625 --> 06:03.416
Then why was she trying to kill you?

06:04.291 --> 06:06.333
We didn't part on good terms.

06:08.666 --> 06:10.958
There are rules about runaway slaves.

06:11.041 --> 06:12.166
She didn't run.

06:12.708 --> 06:14.000
It's complicated.

06:14.625 --> 06:17.375
But now… Now I can finally explain things.

06:25.416 --> 06:27.916
No. Blood magic is not the answer.

06:28.500 --> 06:31.791
I'm not slaughtering the innocent.
I just need to contact Miriam.

06:32.458 --> 06:36.708
Once I do, she'll come back,
return the Circulum, and everyone wins.

06:37.708 --> 06:40.458
But that's not your job.
I'm Knight Commander. I will find them.

06:40.541 --> 06:44.458
Even if a few drops of blood
can do it faster and with less violence?

06:44.541 --> 06:47.333
It always starts
with a few drops, Rez,

06:47.416 --> 06:48.958
but it never stays that way.

06:49.750 --> 06:53.000
Oh, please. Now is not the time
for great moral stances.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.916
I'm trying to help, Tassia.

06:56.875 --> 06:57.791
You were right.

06:58.833 --> 06:59.833
I caused this.

07:01.166 --> 07:02.250
So let me end it.

07:04.541 --> 07:05.375
Please.

07:06.625 --> 07:07.625
She's my sister.

07:11.041 --> 07:13.291
I am the Knight Commander of this palace.

07:13.375 --> 07:16.458
As such, I am going to order
the town guard to lock down the city

07:16.541 --> 07:20.208
and once the palace is secure,
I'm going to hunt down those criminals.

07:20.708 --> 07:23.458
You are going to contain that dragon,
you're gonna stay here and…

07:24.875 --> 07:28.666
If I find any evidence of blood magic,
any at all,

07:29.250 --> 07:31.125
I will report you to The Divine.

07:31.208 --> 07:32.083
Understand?

07:32.750 --> 07:34.125
I won't disappoint you.

07:36.583 --> 07:38.083
You already have.

08:24.500 --> 08:25.875
Okay.

08:27.333 --> 08:28.416
How are you holding up?

08:30.833 --> 08:34.000
The arrow's not helping, but I'm fine.

08:37.833 --> 08:40.875
I'll scout ahead. Make sure
the way to the safe house is clear.

08:46.583 --> 08:49.958
Roland. I'm telling you,
there's gotta be a traitor.

08:50.875 --> 08:53.500
Look, I saw what I saw, Rolls.

08:53.583 --> 08:56.958
Miriam standing over Fairbanks.
Hira's failed rescue.

08:57.041 --> 09:00.583
Oh, and the Magister
that says she's his fucking family.

09:00.666 --> 09:02.958
He owned her, for Maker's sake!

09:03.041 --> 09:05.375
Fine, that was a step too far,

09:05.458 --> 09:08.833
but you can't tell me
this doesn't feel weird.

09:09.750 --> 09:10.791
Then, what's your theory?

09:10.875 --> 09:14.750
That Miriam lured us into stealing
an artifact she didn't know existed

09:14.833 --> 09:16.833
to help a man
she spent her life running from

09:16.916 --> 09:19.458
and got herself shot in the back
to sell it?

09:20.166 --> 09:23.333
Well, of course it doesn't make sense
when you say it like that.

09:24.083 --> 09:26.833
I don't know what's going on,

09:26.916 --> 09:29.125
but my gut says
we're missing something here.

09:29.208 --> 09:31.083
A "get us killed" kind of something.

09:36.208 --> 09:41.666
This might be our last chance to get out
before we learn what that is the hard way.

09:43.875 --> 09:47.583
You know, it's funny
you keep insisting there's a traitor,

09:47.666 --> 09:51.625
because you're the only one
who wants to screw over everyone else.

09:51.708 --> 09:53.291
Ouch.

09:53.875 --> 09:56.375
Ah! You were supposed to wait.

09:57.083 --> 09:58.041
Yeah, I know,

09:58.125 --> 10:01.083
but your extremely loud betrayal
was wasting too much time.

10:04.833 --> 10:06.708
Whatever you decide, I won't blame you.

10:07.791 --> 10:09.750
All I ask is that you don't leave yet.

10:10.250 --> 10:14.583
The city's on lockdown, and you'll never
get past the guards in broad daylight.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.708
They'll kill us all for this, Roland.

10:18.583 --> 10:21.000
Please. You're my best friend. I…

10:21.625 --> 10:22.875
I can't lose you too.

10:24.166 --> 10:26.625
You won't. Qwydion.

10:26.708 --> 10:27.625
Mm.

10:33.333 --> 10:36.083
If you don't trust her, Lacklon, I get it.

10:37.541 --> 10:39.708
Trust me instead.

11:22.333 --> 11:23.166
Leave us.

11:24.291 --> 11:25.125
Now!

11:34.375 --> 11:38.083
I guess we've both
been through the wars today, brother.

11:38.583 --> 11:41.666
But don't worry.
There's just a little bit more.

12:17.125 --> 12:17.958
<i>No!</i>

12:18.041 --> 12:20.750
<i>What have you done to my brother?</i>
<i>You bastard!</i>

12:30.875 --> 12:34.416
I know. I know. I just…
I gotta take it out first, okay? Guys.

12:39.041 --> 12:40.750
Sorry! I'm so sorry.
I'm nearly there, and…

12:42.250 --> 12:43.083
Got it.

12:45.583 --> 12:46.625
Okay.

12:46.708 --> 12:48.041
Now the easy part.

12:57.041 --> 12:58.083
Anytime, Qwydion.

12:58.166 --> 13:02.083
Someone's using blood magic to keep her
from healing, to keep her under.

13:02.916 --> 13:05.000
-Then counter it!
-I'm trying!

13:05.083 --> 13:07.916
There's more than one way
to close a wound.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.041
Get a cloth.

13:09.125 --> 13:10.583
Nobody's dying today.

13:10.666 --> 13:12.791
At least not until I get
some damn answers.

13:22.541 --> 13:23.750
Just stunning.

13:24.708 --> 13:27.791
And, you know, the sunset's fine too.

13:32.916 --> 13:34.041
Mm.

13:34.666 --> 13:35.500
Hira,

13:36.416 --> 13:38.291
you came back.

13:38.916 --> 13:39.916
What do you mean?

13:40.791 --> 13:42.125
I'd never leave you, Miri.

13:42.750 --> 13:44.375
You're everything to me.

13:48.750 --> 13:49.708
Hira.

13:49.791 --> 13:51.000
Hira!

13:52.083 --> 13:54.875
No one can save you
from what you are, Miriam.

13:55.583 --> 14:00.041
In the end, you'll only ever be a tool.

14:01.083 --> 14:02.541
-No!

14:07.458 --> 14:10.041
Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.

14:10.125 --> 14:12.416
A woman like that
doesn't deserve your tears.

14:15.625 --> 14:17.916
-Get away from me!
-Miriam, wait.

14:20.458 --> 14:22.250
-That won't… Miriam.

14:22.333 --> 14:24.208
-Stop.

14:25.291 --> 14:28.666
You can't harm me here,
because we're inside your mind.

14:29.583 --> 14:31.708
Nothing here is real, except for us.

14:31.791 --> 14:33.458
How?

14:34.250 --> 14:37.166
Blood magic
can make a lot of things possible.

14:37.916 --> 14:41.083
I needed to speak with you,
and this was the only way.

14:41.166 --> 14:43.250
I have nothing to say to you.

14:43.333 --> 14:45.250
I need to wake up.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.708
-We don't have time for this.

14:50.791 --> 14:53.041
You've been hurt, Miriam,
but I can save you.

14:53.625 --> 14:55.416
You just need to hear me out first.

14:59.208 --> 15:00.041
You know,

15:00.916 --> 15:02.791
there was a time when you trusted me.

15:11.208 --> 15:12.750
Weren't we both happier then?

15:14.166 --> 15:16.500
You were happy. I was trapped.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.041
We were all trapped.

15:19.166 --> 15:20.708
But at least we were together.

15:23.250 --> 15:26.250
We could be like this again,
the three of us,

15:26.333 --> 15:27.791
after I restore Neb.

15:28.291 --> 15:30.333
That really is impossible.

15:31.166 --> 15:34.083
-It's not him in there. It's some demon.
-For now.

15:35.125 --> 15:36.916
I needed to keep his body going.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.625
Binding a demon to it
was the only option I had.

15:40.791 --> 15:43.000
But I don't want Neb
to be like this either.

15:44.500 --> 15:47.083
The Circulum can bring people
back from the dead, Miriam,

15:47.166 --> 15:48.958
just as they were in life.

15:50.208 --> 15:52.041
But I can't use it without you.

15:53.208 --> 15:54.750
-You're Neb's twin.

15:54.833 --> 15:56.708
His blood runs through your veins,

15:56.791 --> 15:58.916
and without it,
I can't perform the ritual.

16:06.791 --> 16:08.708
Don't you want things
to be like they were?

16:11.208 --> 16:14.125
-You mean like this?

16:20.166 --> 16:21.250
Oh!

16:26.333 --> 16:29.208
A slave
should never harm her betters!

16:30.041 --> 16:31.791
That isn't fair and you know it.

16:31.875 --> 16:35.000
I was a child.
I couldn't even protect myself.

16:35.916 --> 16:37.458
Were you helpless here too?

16:39.708 --> 16:42.250
This is a waste of time.
You're dying, Miriam.

16:42.333 --> 16:45.166
You're the one
who wanted to rifle through old memories.

16:45.250 --> 16:48.625
Don't you want to see how well
you protected us at your Harrowing?

16:55.875 --> 16:56.750
No!

16:56.833 --> 17:01.208
Fight it, boy! No Ammosine
has failed a Harrowing in 300 years!

17:04.708 --> 17:06.875
And none ever will.

17:11.833 --> 17:14.083
-No!

17:14.750 --> 17:17.250
A bodyguard must serve their purpose.

17:17.833 --> 17:19.083
Even to the end.

17:20.833 --> 17:24.458
She sacrificed my brother,
and you did nothing!

17:56.166 --> 17:57.000
Miriam.

17:58.500 --> 18:00.291
-What did you do?

18:01.833 --> 18:03.291
You killed them both.

18:05.166 --> 18:06.375
I had to.

18:07.083 --> 18:08.000
I know.

18:14.625 --> 18:15.458
Run.

18:15.958 --> 18:17.333
Run!

18:18.000 --> 18:19.166
I lied for you, Miriam.

18:20.708 --> 18:22.833
Made it so the Templars
would never find you,

18:22.916 --> 18:24.166
because you were right.

18:24.958 --> 18:26.125
I couldn't protect you.

18:27.416 --> 18:28.833
But things have changed.

18:33.416 --> 18:37.208
Ever since you left, I've been rebuilding,
trying to make things right again.

18:41.083 --> 18:43.791
I've become the mage
Mother never thought I could be.

18:43.875 --> 18:47.458
I have risen through the ranks
of the Imperial Chantry. Don't you see?

18:48.250 --> 18:50.166
You don't have to keep running, Miriam.

18:50.250 --> 18:52.166
Not from the past, not from Mother,

18:52.666 --> 18:53.791
not from yourself.

18:58.250 --> 19:01.208
By the grace of the Maker,
I will become the next Divine.

19:01.291 --> 19:05.500
And together, the three of us can
make Tevinter a better place for everyone.

19:14.625 --> 19:15.458
No.

19:17.166 --> 19:18.000
What?

19:20.000 --> 19:23.041
This… This is the role you were born for.

19:23.750 --> 19:27.291
I don't care what others call it,
to me, we will always be family.

19:28.250 --> 19:32.041
I'm offering you a life where you matter,
a-- a home where you'll be safe.

19:32.125 --> 19:34.166
I'm promising to take care of you.

19:34.250 --> 19:36.166
I said no.

19:37.291 --> 19:39.333
Whatever your intentions,

19:39.916 --> 19:41.708
I will never be a slave again.

19:42.791 --> 19:44.833
Have you really ever been anything else?

19:45.458 --> 19:48.541
You've been free for years now
and what do you have to show for it?

19:48.625 --> 19:52.750
Nothing! You were a petty thief,
bound to a string of petty tyrants

19:52.833 --> 19:55.125
who cared less about you
than the most indifferent owner.

19:56.125 --> 19:58.208
You had no home, no family.

19:58.291 --> 20:01.166
Without direction,
you wander the world completely lost.

20:01.250 --> 20:04.708
You have contributed nothing but misery
and achieved nothing at all.

20:04.791 --> 20:07.375
-You are less than a slave, Miriam.

20:08.166 --> 20:09.333
I've made mistakes.

20:10.541 --> 20:11.708
But they were mine.

20:12.958 --> 20:13.958
I chose them.

20:15.166 --> 20:16.500
Don't you understand that?

20:18.750 --> 20:20.541
You let me go once, Rezaren.

20:21.625 --> 20:23.875
I'm asking you to do it again.

20:28.541 --> 20:30.166
I'm offering you purpose.

20:32.958 --> 20:34.833
A chance to change the world.

20:40.083 --> 20:42.875
And all you can think about
are your own petty desires.

20:44.916 --> 20:46.958
I'd rather die than be a thing again.

20:53.250 --> 20:54.916
Are you sure about that, Miriam?

21:04.750 --> 21:05.708
Oh, shit.

21:11.291 --> 21:13.875
You live because I will it.

21:14.958 --> 21:16.458
I don't want to hurt you.

21:17.583 --> 21:19.500
But if you won't listen to reason,

21:19.583 --> 21:22.083
I will speak in a language
you can understand.

21:23.041 --> 21:26.708
-Hira is alive, and she's in my custody.

21:26.791 --> 21:28.083
You're lying.

21:28.166 --> 21:29.250
I don't have to.

21:30.625 --> 21:34.875
Give me the Circulum and I will give you
the woman you so irrationally desire.

21:36.000 --> 21:38.875
-Run, and I will have her killed.
-Bastard!

21:41.625 --> 21:43.750
Oh, Miriam.

21:44.291 --> 21:46.833
I did promise
to take care of you, didn't I?

22:03.958 --> 22:05.041
Bring me the Circulum

22:06.125 --> 22:09.791
and I will prove
how wrong you are about everything.

22:18.000 --> 22:18.958
Oh, shit.

22:23.541 --> 22:25.250
-It's okay, I've got you, Miriam.

22:25.333 --> 22:27.041
It's okay. Breathe.

22:27.666 --> 22:29.000
-Breathe with me.

22:55.875 --> 22:56.708
Miriam.

22:57.375 --> 22:58.250
What happened?

23:01.208 --> 23:02.500
Hira's alive.

23:11.500 --> 23:13.166
And we're going to save her.
