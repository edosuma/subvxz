WEBVTT

00:01.935 --> 00:03.504
Please tell the governor
that BlueBell is not

00:03.537 --> 00:05.339
and will never be interested
in merging with Fillmore.

00:05.373 --> 00:06.307
Fillmore supports the merger.

00:06.340 --> 00:08.309
He's gonna try and take
over the whole town.

00:08.342 --> 00:11.445
I have a little boy who gets me
up at 5:30 in the morning.

00:11.479 --> 00:13.547
I tried to hang, but I just
can't, and I didn't want

00:13.581 --> 00:15.283
to tell you
that I'm a tired old loser.

00:15.316 --> 00:16.784
I can handle a tired old loser.

00:16.817 --> 00:18.819
It was really sweet
what you said earlier

00:18.852 --> 00:20.821
about not being able
to resist me.

00:20.854 --> 00:24.392
I mean, I could just
stop... resisting.

00:24.425 --> 00:26.360
Lynly and I--
we're not going away,

00:26.394 --> 00:27.795
so you can bury your head
in the sand,

00:27.828 --> 00:29.363
or you can grow up,
you can accept it.

00:29.397 --> 00:30.598
You were with
George and Tansy.

00:30.631 --> 00:32.133
Do you think he still
has feelings for her?

00:32.165 --> 00:33.601
Sometimes I think
I never should have

00:33.634 --> 00:36.304
let you go.

00:39.107 --> 00:41.309
JOEL:
Here's one.

00:41.342 --> 00:43.611
"Two bedrooms.
Wrap-around porch." Nice.

00:43.644 --> 00:45.146
Uh, "Street parking."

00:45.179 --> 00:46.447
I can deal with that.

00:46.480 --> 00:48.216
"Landfill adjacent."

00:48.249 --> 00:49.350
And that's a no.

00:49.383 --> 00:50.584
(grunts)

00:50.618 --> 00:52.820
Look, I'm not saying I'm
in favor of this merger,

00:52.853 --> 00:54.322
but if BlueBell does
become part of Fillmore,

00:54.355 --> 00:55.589
at least we'll have more
houses to choose from.

00:55.623 --> 00:57.125
That is not funny.

00:57.158 --> 00:59.193
Look, we have two
viable options. Just pick one.

00:59.227 --> 01:00.394
All right, well, fine.

01:00.428 --> 01:02.363
I say we go with the
one on Oak Street, then.

01:02.396 --> 01:03.531
What? No, not that one.

01:03.564 --> 01:05.833
So, when you said
pick one, you...

01:05.866 --> 01:07.568
Oak Street has termites, okay?

01:07.601 --> 01:09.170
I hate bugs.

01:09.203 --> 01:11.605
Even if we tent, I would picture
them crawling all over me.

01:11.639 --> 01:13.474
Just, no. No, no.

01:13.507 --> 01:15.309
We need to go with the
fixer-upper on Elm.

01:15.343 --> 01:17.245
That house is next
to Crickett and Stanley.

01:17.278 --> 01:19.213
Are you kidding me?
No, no, I cannot live

01:19.247 --> 01:21.549
near people who sing
show tunes all day. I still

01:21.582 --> 01:24.152
have PTSD from the summer
I lived below Mandy Patinkin.

01:24.185 --> 01:26.854
Oh, not this again.
There's still
your Aunt Winifred's house.

01:26.887 --> 01:28.456
Now that you're all BFF-y

01:28.489 --> 01:30.191
with the Wilkes,
maybe she'll rent to us.

01:30.224 --> 01:31.459
No. No, no, no, no.

01:31.492 --> 01:33.461
I have been warned
about Wicked Winifred.

01:33.494 --> 01:36.164
Vivian says that Cruella de Vil
would be a better landlord.

01:36.197 --> 01:38.532
Yeah, but do you remember
those built-ins?

01:38.566 --> 01:40.334
I mean, what's
a few Dalmatians

01:40.368 --> 01:42.136
compared to those
built-ins, right?

01:42.170 --> 01:45.339
Look, I finally have
a family I like, you know,

01:45.373 --> 01:47.541
and I don't want
to mess it up.

01:47.575 --> 01:48.876
We'll figure something out.

01:48.909 --> 01:50.644
WADE:
Aloha, Joel.

01:50.678 --> 01:53.614
Doc. Beautiful day to save
BlueBell, don't you think?

01:53.647 --> 01:55.483
Well, you
seem chipper.

01:55.516 --> 01:57.885
Well, Vivian's introducing me
to little Harley this afternoon.

01:57.918 --> 01:59.887
Yeah, you must be excited
to finally have a playdate

01:59.920 --> 02:01.289
with an intellectual equal.

02:01.322 --> 02:03.491
Hilarious, Doc, but no.
This is a test.

02:03.524 --> 02:05.359
Once I hit it off
with the young one,

02:05.393 --> 02:06.894
I get to move forward
with the mom.

02:06.927 --> 02:08.362
JOEL:
Forward?

02:08.395 --> 02:10.231
Upstairs to the boudoir.

02:10.264 --> 02:11.332
Ew, gross!

02:11.365 --> 02:12.366
So, you and Vivian
haven't, uh...?

02:12.400 --> 02:14.502
Wow, dude, that is,
uh... that is unexpected.

02:14.535 --> 02:17.305
Yeah, well, Vivian's, uh--
I don't know-- different.

02:17.338 --> 02:18.406
I like her.

02:18.439 --> 02:19.907
So I'm trying this new thing.

02:19.940 --> 02:21.375
I think people
call it dating.

02:21.409 --> 02:23.511
You know, hand holding,
taking her out to dinner.

02:23.544 --> 02:25.379
Stuff you see 'em do
on The Bachelor.

02:25.413 --> 02:27.681
I even spent hours, literally
hours, the other night,

02:27.715 --> 02:29.683
talking to her
batty Aunt Winifred.

02:29.717 --> 02:31.352
Are you kidding me?

02:31.385 --> 02:32.920
No, we got into a whole thing

02:32.953 --> 02:34.655
about Kenny Rogers'
plastic surgery and...

02:34.688 --> 02:36.657
Vivian won't let Joel
and I meet Aunt Winifred,

02:36.690 --> 02:38.359
because she says
she's awful and mean.

02:38.392 --> 02:39.293
She's not mean.

02:39.327 --> 02:41.962
Opinionated, maybe,
but hell, she loves me.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.398
Maybe, uh...
maybe Vivian

02:44.432 --> 02:46.267
just thinks
you two are embarrassing.

02:47.968 --> 02:48.936
(stammers)

02:48.969 --> 02:51.439
(car horn honks)

02:51.472 --> 02:53.541
(seagulls calling)

02:53.574 --> 02:55.676
(birds singing)

03:01.382 --> 03:03.984
Thanks to the governor's sister
falling in love with our town,

03:04.017 --> 03:06.254
Lieutenant Governor
Alex P. Byrd arrives in BlueBell

03:06.287 --> 03:07.421
in less than 48 hours.

03:07.455 --> 03:08.556
I looked him up.

03:08.589 --> 03:10.291
Alex Byrd is very handsome.

03:10.324 --> 03:11.692
Oh, Wanda!

03:11.725 --> 03:13.527
Now, he's only gonna be here
for two hours,

03:13.561 --> 03:15.563
but I'm sure we can pack in
a lot of charm

03:15.596 --> 03:16.697
in that tiny little window.

03:16.730 --> 03:19.300
And we will halt
this merger

03:19.333 --> 03:21.635
by getting Bluebell declared
a historic landmark.

03:21.669 --> 03:23.771
Hmm. That's nearly a plan.

03:23.804 --> 03:25.406
What? You don't
think it'll work?

03:25.439 --> 03:26.707
I make a fantastic
first impression!

03:26.740 --> 03:28.509
How could Vivian be
embarrassed of us?

03:28.542 --> 03:29.643
LAVON:
Now, the one

03:29.677 --> 03:32.280
challenge that we all face
is that, uh,

03:32.313 --> 03:34.282
well, not too many
historically significant events

03:34.315 --> 03:35.716
have actually happened here.

03:35.749 --> 03:37.585
So, when the lieutenant governor
arrives,

03:37.618 --> 03:40.288
we're gonna have to put on
our best BlueBell smile...

03:40.321 --> 03:41.622
and... and wing it.

03:41.655 --> 03:44.458
And there's the nonsense
we all know and love.

03:44.492 --> 03:46.460
We're gonna have to tell him
everything that we can think of

03:46.494 --> 03:48.262
that-that might,
that just might,

03:48.296 --> 03:49.730
convince him
of our historic relevance.

03:49.763 --> 03:53.467
Oh. My mom's toilet
in her bathroom is really old.

03:53.501 --> 03:56.337
And I mean, I was saving it
for Antiques Road Show,

03:56.370 --> 03:57.771
but I would be happy to...

03:57.805 --> 04:00.007
No historic commodes, Tom.

04:00.040 --> 04:03.411
No. No, no. No.

04:03.444 --> 04:05.513
This visit is of the highest
stakes for BlueBell,

04:05.546 --> 04:09.583
which means no
fighting, no whining,

04:09.617 --> 04:10.784
no drama.

04:10.818 --> 04:13.487
George and Lynly will hand out
your assignments, and I expect

04:13.521 --> 04:17.024
everyone in town square tomorrow
at 11:00 a.m. for rehearsal.

04:17.057 --> 04:18.459
Thank you.

04:18.492 --> 04:19.392
(applause)

04:19.427 --> 04:21.661
Compulsory tomfoolery.
I love this place!

04:21.695 --> 04:23.631
(crowd chatter)

04:23.664 --> 04:26.534
Hey, Lynly, you up
for another mani-pedi party?

04:26.567 --> 04:28.702
Absolutely.
I'll bring snacks.

04:28.736 --> 04:31.505
Uh, well,
y'all are hanging out now?

04:31.539 --> 04:33.441
With you busy saving BlueBell,

04:33.474 --> 04:35.476
and Tansy broken
up with Scooter...

04:35.509 --> 04:37.077
Oh. You broke up
with Scooter? Ah.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.412
You were right.

04:38.446 --> 04:39.447
He's a jerk.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.515
Is us hanging
freaking you out?

04:41.549 --> 04:42.616
No!

04:42.650 --> 04:44.518
No, not at all. No.

04:44.552 --> 04:47.321
I-I... I used to date
my best friend's ex-wife.

04:47.355 --> 04:48.689
My best friend.
But then he was

04:48.722 --> 04:50.090
dating my ex-fiancÃ©e,

04:50.123 --> 04:51.525
and now you're hanging out
with my ex-girlfriend.

04:51.559 --> 04:53.361
It's all part
of that BlueBell charm! It is.

04:53.394 --> 04:54.528
It's super.

04:54.562 --> 04:56.830
It is super duper. Next.

04:59.500 --> 05:00.668
Hey!

05:00.701 --> 05:02.536
Oh, sorry I'm late.
Hey, sweetie.

05:02.570 --> 05:03.837
Ooh.

05:03.871 --> 05:05.839
You look marvelous.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.776
Billy Crystal.
(laughs)

05:08.809 --> 05:10.711
Hey.
Oh. No, we're in a fight.

05:10.744 --> 05:12.079
We are?

05:12.112 --> 05:13.347
Yes.

05:13.381 --> 05:14.482
We are.

05:14.515 --> 05:16.584
Why did you let Wade meet
Aunt Winifred--

05:16.617 --> 05:18.819
who he said is not mean--
and not me and Joel?

05:18.852 --> 05:19.887
Are you ashamed of us?

05:19.920 --> 05:21.855
Okay, Zoe, I'm sorry.

05:21.889 --> 05:24.358
I did sort of mislead
you about Winifred.

05:24.392 --> 05:25.426
Wade's right;
she's not mean.

05:25.459 --> 05:27.595
But you really can't meet her.
She will hate you.

05:27.628 --> 05:28.762
What? Why?

05:28.796 --> 05:30.431
Because you're a New Yorker.

05:30.464 --> 05:32.132
She has two exes
from New York.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.701
She blames the city.

05:33.734 --> 05:35.403
Spreads to Connecticut.

05:35.436 --> 05:37.571
And Pennsylvania,
north of Route 80.
(phone chirps)

05:37.605 --> 05:38.639
Look, I'm so sorry.

05:38.672 --> 05:39.807
I know you guys
love that house,

05:39.840 --> 05:41.542
but she is not
gonna budge.

05:41.575 --> 05:43.544
Hey, great news.

05:43.577 --> 05:45.413
The captain of the Fairhope

05:45.446 --> 05:47.815
senior slow pitch
softball team died.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.483
Which is sad,

05:49.517 --> 05:50.918
but they had to
forfeit the game

05:50.951 --> 05:53.454
to go to his funeral,
and now

05:53.487 --> 05:55.589
guess who's playoff bound.

05:55.623 --> 05:57.725
Ooh, game one is tomorrow night!

05:57.758 --> 05:59.860
Tomorrow night
is my date with Wade,

05:59.893 --> 06:02.162
which I'm very excited about,
and you're gonna take Harley

06:02.195 --> 06:03.831
and you're gonna have
a sleepover.

06:03.864 --> 06:08.569
Maybe someone else in the family
could do it.

06:08.602 --> 06:10.137
Yes.

06:10.170 --> 06:13.441
Joel and I would love
to hang out with Harley.

06:13.474 --> 06:14.642
I adore that kid.

06:14.675 --> 06:16.444
And he adores you,
and so do I.

06:16.477 --> 06:17.945
You're totally saving
my life. Thank you.
Yes.

06:17.978 --> 06:20.180
You're welcome.
And if you could mention

06:20.213 --> 06:22.182
the saving the life part
to Aunt Winifred...

06:22.215 --> 06:24.418
She wouldn't care.
Would only hate you more.

06:24.452 --> 06:26.654
(on TV):
 Hi. It's Don Todd,

06:26.687 --> 06:28.422
and today we're on Easter Island

06:28.456 --> 06:30.724
to learn how to
concentrate on our shots
What?

06:30.758 --> 06:32.926
even when people
are watching you.

06:33.927 --> 06:37.798
Like, really watching you.

06:40.934 --> 06:43.170
Hey, babe, how was your
afternoon with Tansy?

06:43.203 --> 06:44.872
Not so good.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.474
W-Why? W-What happened?

06:46.507 --> 06:47.941
It wasn't my fault.
It was an accident.

06:47.975 --> 06:49.209
There was this
whole misunderstanding

06:49.242 --> 06:50.944
and...

06:52.513 --> 06:53.914
Hey, Tansy, you in there?

06:53.947 --> 06:56.517
Is everything okay?

06:57.518 --> 06:59.953
Do I look okay?

06:59.987 --> 07:02.723
Look what your girlfriend did
to my hair!

07:07.528 --> 07:09.730
See, I-I really think
she's mad at me.

07:13.233 --> 07:14.968
Wait, you never raced
a soapbox derby?

07:15.002 --> 07:16.537
Man, we got to
change that.

07:16.570 --> 07:17.938
Hey, look, I can help you;
I'm good with cars.

07:17.971 --> 07:20.741
Can my car be red
with a silver stripe?

07:20.774 --> 07:22.810
Eh, stripes are pretty cool,

07:22.843 --> 07:24.945
but what about a lightning bolt?

07:24.978 --> 07:27.615
(gasps, chuckles)
Hey, Wade?

07:27.648 --> 07:29.016
Want to hold
my salamander, Cecil?

07:29.049 --> 07:30.618
Heck yeah, come here.

07:30.651 --> 07:32.686
Oh, when he lets you
hold Cecil,

07:32.720 --> 07:34.221
that means he likes you.

07:34.254 --> 07:35.989
Must run in the family.
(chuckles)

07:36.023 --> 07:38.225
Hey, Mom?

07:38.258 --> 07:40.694
Cecil wants ice cream.

07:40.728 --> 07:41.962
Oh, he does?

07:41.995 --> 07:43.564
Okay, let me guess, chocolate?

07:43.597 --> 07:44.798
Uh-huh.
(chuckles)

07:44.832 --> 07:46.534
I'll be right back.
Yeah.

07:46.567 --> 07:47.735
Man, he is so cool.

07:47.768 --> 07:49.002
So, uh,

07:49.036 --> 07:51.038
Cecil's got pretty
discriminating tastes, huh?

07:51.071 --> 07:52.573
What else does he like?

07:52.606 --> 07:54.642
Not you.

07:54.675 --> 07:56.043
Come again?

07:56.076 --> 07:58.546
He hates you,
everything about you.

07:58.579 --> 07:59.947
What's that?

07:59.980 --> 08:01.982
Oh.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.718
He says he's gonna kill you

08:04.752 --> 08:06.920
in your sleep
unless you break up with my mom.

08:06.954 --> 08:09.256
Well, that is a, uh,

08:09.289 --> 08:12.626
very articulate salamander.
(chuckles)

08:18.932 --> 08:21.635
Look at these cute diaper bags.

08:21.669 --> 08:23.003
Oh.

08:23.036 --> 08:25.673
Aw. Look, custom-made diapers.

08:25.706 --> 08:27.875
Oh, Lord, what are they
gonna think of next?

08:27.908 --> 08:29.643
What's wrong with them?

08:29.677 --> 08:31.679
Well, you're gonna use
about ten of those a day

08:31.712 --> 08:34.748
for the first few months,
because basically all babies do

08:34.782 --> 08:37.017
is they eat, poop,
sleep, repeat.

08:37.049 --> 08:39.687
Well, thank you for that
inspiring vision of parenthood.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.955
Honey, I'm just trying
to prepare you for the reality,

08:41.989 --> 08:44.992
and believe me, you are gonna
love all the poop.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.059
Now,

08:46.093 --> 08:47.695
if you'll excuse me,

08:47.728 --> 08:49.630
I am supposed to go
through our medical records

08:49.663 --> 08:51.765
to see if anyone
of historical note

08:51.799 --> 08:54.034
has ever actually
been treated here.

08:54.067 --> 08:55.903
And I don't think
Delma Lewis counts,

08:55.936 --> 08:59.039
even though she has been
to 200 Dolly Parton concerts.

08:59.072 --> 09:01.842
Well, I'll see you
later, sweetie.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.814
Who's that?

09:06.847 --> 09:08.115
Oh, that's the
lieutenant governor.

09:08.148 --> 09:10.083
Does it look okay here?

09:10.117 --> 09:11.652
'Cause we're trying
to kiss butt.

09:11.685 --> 09:13.754
That's the lieutenant governor?

09:13.787 --> 09:16.657
I know.
Way too hot to be a politician.

09:16.690 --> 09:17.991
(chuckles weakly)

09:18.025 --> 09:19.793
Yeah.

09:19.827 --> 09:21.795
Way too hot.

09:21.829 --> 09:23.964
LYNLY:
 We went through this
 last night.

09:23.997 --> 09:25.733
Don't we have better things
to talk about today?

09:25.766 --> 09:27.067
The lieutenant
governor is arriving.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.669
Lavon needs us.

09:28.702 --> 09:30.370
Right, I totally agree, um...

09:30.403 --> 09:33.006
(clears throat) There are more
important things to talk about,

09:33.040 --> 09:34.742
and I have a lot
of work to do,

09:34.775 --> 09:36.944
but if you could just explain
to me one more time

09:36.977 --> 09:39.046
how you accidentally
burned off Tansy's hair.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.882
It's because she has
this professional curling iron

09:41.915 --> 09:43.717
that doesn't have
a release spring.

09:43.751 --> 09:45.385
So when you hold the iron
too long in one place...

09:45.418 --> 09:47.387
But why would you hold it
for too long?

09:47.420 --> 09:49.356
Because I wanted to get
the curl really good.

09:49.389 --> 09:50.691
I'm a perfectionist.

09:50.724 --> 09:52.726
And then I smelled burning,

09:52.760 --> 09:54.628
and then I let go,
but the clampy thing didn't.

09:54.662 --> 09:56.163
Right, right, right,
the clampy thing.

09:56.196 --> 09:57.631
(chuckles)

09:58.899 --> 10:00.400
Oh, my God,
you don't believe me.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.402
I didn't say that.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.972
Wow. What kind of monster
do you think I am?

10:09.409 --> 10:10.878
Places, everyone!

10:10.911 --> 10:12.880
Rehearsal is up.

10:12.913 --> 10:14.982
And, Lieutenant Governor Byrd,

10:15.015 --> 10:16.817
this is our town gazebo,
Oh.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.786
designed in 1892

10:18.819 --> 10:21.922
by one of Alabama's
foremost gazeb-ists.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.924
Really? Who?

10:23.957 --> 10:26.626
Uh, one whose name is, um...

10:28.028 --> 10:29.196
...sadly lost to history.

10:30.197 --> 10:32.165
I, Lieutenant Governor Byrd,

10:32.199 --> 10:33.166
am not impressed.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.902
Look, Crickett.
Oh.

10:34.935 --> 10:36.436
It's Lieutenant Governor Byrd.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.205
Welcome to BlueBell.

10:38.238 --> 10:39.907
We're Belles.

10:39.940 --> 10:41.875
Allow us to tell you

10:41.909 --> 10:44.644
all about our town's rich
historical tradition.

10:46.179 --> 10:47.915
That's your line.

10:47.948 --> 10:49.950
I was pausing for effect.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.752
Can we start over?
Elodie ruined

10:51.785 --> 10:53.053
my preparation.

10:53.086 --> 10:55.723
I think this rehearsal
is gonna take a while.

10:55.756 --> 10:56.790
Yep.

10:56.824 --> 10:58.726
Hey, about tonight,

10:58.759 --> 11:00.928
um, where is Harley
going to sleep?

11:00.961 --> 11:03.063
I did not think about that.

11:03.096 --> 11:04.932
I don't know, maybe the couch?

11:04.965 --> 11:06.867
Well, what happens when
he falls asleep at 7:30,

11:06.900 --> 11:08.435
and we have to spend
the rest of the night

11:08.468 --> 11:09.402
tiptoeing around
in the dark?

11:09.436 --> 11:11.038
Didn't really
think that through, either.

11:11.071 --> 11:13.006
You know,
we wouldn't have this problem

11:13.040 --> 11:15.876
is somebody would just get over
their show tune phobia.

11:15.909 --> 11:18.445
You try writing a novel
with someone singing selections

11:18.478 --> 11:20.480
from Evita
over your head all day.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.482
You're cute
when you're infuriated.

11:22.515 --> 11:23.917
Oh, thanks.

11:23.951 --> 11:26.186
LAVON (clears throat):
Governor Byrd,

11:26.219 --> 11:27.955
this is, uh, Dr. Hart,

11:27.988 --> 11:29.857
second-generation town doctor.
Oh.

11:29.890 --> 11:30.724
A living legacy.

11:30.758 --> 11:33.460
Yes, yep, my dead father
collected coins.

11:33.493 --> 11:34.828
Really old coins.

11:34.862 --> 11:36.930
Really? That's the best
you came up with?

11:36.964 --> 11:39.466
Lieutenant Governor Byrd
is still unimpressed.

11:39.499 --> 11:42.936
And-and this is famous
author, uh, Joel Stephens,

11:42.970 --> 11:45.873
writing his next best seller,
a future classic,

11:45.906 --> 11:48.475
uh, a historic novel
set in BlueBell.

11:48.508 --> 11:50.477
It's not really
a historic novel.

11:50.510 --> 11:52.079
It's more of a...
It's a modern cowboy.

11:52.112 --> 11:54.081
Are you trying to
kill me, Joel?

11:54.114 --> 11:55.816
(groans)

11:58.518 --> 12:00.220
I'm sorry.

12:00.253 --> 12:02.089
I'm freaking out.
I mean...

12:02.122 --> 12:04.157
This town was founded
250 years ago,

12:04.191 --> 12:07.094
and-and Tom's mom's toilet
is our crowning achievement.

12:07.127 --> 12:09.129
Lavon, deep breaths.

12:09.162 --> 12:10.530
He's gonna love this town.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.866
Yeah, I mean, what with
the whole small town,

12:12.900 --> 12:15.502
neighbor helping neighbor sweet
thing you got going on here,

12:15.535 --> 12:17.771
all the historic stuff, that's
just gonna sail right by.

12:17.805 --> 12:19.506
I just need to relax.

12:19.539 --> 12:20.941
Yeah.
Unwind.

12:20.974 --> 12:22.209
(Lynly sobbing)
Lynly.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.844
You okay?

12:23.877 --> 12:25.112
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

12:25.145 --> 12:26.880
Don't worry about me; I'm good.

12:28.015 --> 12:29.983
(groans)

12:30.017 --> 12:31.751
Uh-oh.

12:36.890 --> 12:38.058
Thank you so much
for yesterday.

12:38.091 --> 12:41.128
Nah.
It was amazing to see
how much Harley liked you.

12:41.161 --> 12:44.998
Yeah, well, uh,
about that.

12:45.032 --> 12:46.566
Look, Harley may have liked me,

12:46.599 --> 12:49.837
but apparently,
if I don't break up with you,

12:49.870 --> 12:52.806
Cecil the salamander
is gonna kill me in my sleep.

12:52.840 --> 12:55.008
No, he just needs
to spend more time with you.

12:55.042 --> 12:56.543
How about tomorrow
you come with us

12:56.576 --> 12:58.812
to my Aunt Winifred's
crab boil?

12:58.846 --> 13:00.013
Bring him a toy
truck or something.

13:00.047 --> 13:01.281
Yeah, it sounds great.

13:01.314 --> 13:02.883
Hey,

13:02.916 --> 13:04.351
I promise you

13:04.384 --> 13:06.119
I will win that kid over.

13:06.153 --> 13:07.554
All right?
Okay.

13:07.587 --> 13:08.956
Good.

13:08.989 --> 13:10.290
'Cause I was thinking

13:10.323 --> 13:13.994
maybe we should
get dessert to go.

13:17.931 --> 13:19.166
(clears throat)
Waiter!

13:19.199 --> 13:20.868
HARLEY:
I don't get it.

13:20.901 --> 13:22.903
Your house is a hotel?

13:22.936 --> 13:24.905
I think you better take me home.

13:24.938 --> 13:26.339
No, no, not a hotel.

13:26.373 --> 13:28.241
Bed-and-breakfast, which--

13:28.275 --> 13:30.343
really cool thing-- means when
we wake up in the morning,

13:30.377 --> 13:32.012
breakfast is free.

13:32.045 --> 13:34.181
So is breakfast at my house.
Let's go.

13:34.214 --> 13:35.315
Well, you know
something else

13:35.348 --> 13:36.884
that's cool
about the Whippoorwill?

13:36.917 --> 13:40.053
Someone else cleans
our room for us. What?

13:40.087 --> 13:42.055
My mom cleans my room.

13:42.089 --> 13:43.891
I miss her.

13:43.924 --> 13:45.625
No!

13:45.658 --> 13:47.928
We're gonna have fun.

13:47.961 --> 13:50.297
What do you usually do
when you're at home right now?

13:50.330 --> 13:52.132
I like to build forts.

13:52.165 --> 13:55.002
Uh, unfortunately, the
furniture here is antique,

13:55.035 --> 13:56.904
which means breakable.

13:56.937 --> 13:57.770
No offense,

13:57.804 --> 13:59.606
but this place
isn't very kid-friendly.

13:59.639 --> 14:02.175
My mom says you guys
are nearly married.

14:02.209 --> 14:04.344
Oh, um, I guess...

14:04.377 --> 14:06.246
suppose that's kind of...
kind of true.

14:06.279 --> 14:07.948
Why wouldn't you want
to live somewhere

14:07.981 --> 14:09.216
where you can have a kid?

14:09.249 --> 14:10.984
Or at least a dog or a cat?

14:11.018 --> 14:12.986
Well, we're looking
for a new place,

14:13.020 --> 14:15.255
but good real estate
is tricky to find.

14:15.288 --> 14:17.224
My dad found a house;
took him two weeks.

14:17.257 --> 14:19.026
Well, we want to stay
right in town.

14:19.059 --> 14:20.160
And some people
don't like bugs.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.194
And some people
don't like singing.

14:21.228 --> 14:23.130
Some people have never heard
of exterminators.

14:23.163 --> 14:24.264
Some people have never
heard of earplugs.

14:24.297 --> 14:25.398
Are some people you guys?

14:25.432 --> 14:26.633
Are you fighting?

14:26.666 --> 14:28.101
No one is yelling,

14:28.135 --> 14:29.369
but it seems like
you're fighting.

14:29.402 --> 14:32.405
No, no, it's certainly not...

14:32.439 --> 14:34.441
Sometimes I watch Dr. Phil
with Brando.

14:34.474 --> 14:36.076
You can learn a lot.

14:36.109 --> 14:37.210
So,

14:37.244 --> 14:38.245
which one of you

14:38.278 --> 14:40.280
is afraid of commitment?

14:40.313 --> 14:42.149
What? No, no.
What? No one. No.

14:42.182 --> 14:44.117
She doesn't know
how to compromise.
He just
refuses to be reasonable.

14:44.151 --> 14:45.986
Me? You're the one
who's completely unreasonable
Me? I'm not the one refusing

14:46.019 --> 14:47.287
when it comes to singing.
It's singing.
to deal with one little insect

14:47.320 --> 14:48.788
It's good for the soul.
that won't even be there
when we move in.

14:48.821 --> 14:50.991
That place has an amazing
porch swing.
That place
has an amazing kitchen.

14:51.024 --> 14:52.125
You have asthma!
You don't cook!

14:53.226 --> 14:54.394
(grunting)

14:54.427 --> 14:56.429
(chuckling)

15:07.140 --> 15:08.475
I didn't offer you
anything to drink.

15:08.508 --> 15:10.944
Do you want something to drink?
No, I'm good.

15:13.513 --> 15:15.482
(doorbell rings)

15:15.515 --> 15:17.484
(sighs)

15:19.486 --> 15:20.954
What's going on?

15:20.988 --> 15:22.222
Is everything okay?

15:22.255 --> 15:25.158
It was, and then someone said
something about a dog, and...

15:25.192 --> 15:26.493
I don't feel well.

15:26.526 --> 15:28.128
What happened to your sweater?

15:29.429 --> 15:30.463
He had a stomachache.

15:32.199 --> 15:34.034
WADE:
Yeah, and you have

15:34.067 --> 15:35.435
the letters "M.D."
after your name.

15:35.468 --> 15:37.070
Yes, well, I tried everything,

15:37.104 --> 15:38.338
but he insisted
that he needed his mom.

15:38.371 --> 15:40.307
Right, sudden stomachache.

15:40.340 --> 15:42.342
Man, you got played.

15:42.375 --> 15:45.378
Yeah, he used
psychological water boarding.

15:45.412 --> 15:47.714
And he won by a landslide.

15:47.747 --> 15:50.050
ZOE (sighs): Well, I'm sorry
that we ruined your night.

15:50.083 --> 15:52.119
Me, not so much.
Let's ride back in silence.

15:52.152 --> 15:53.520
That's the first thing
we've agreed on in hours.

15:53.553 --> 15:55.155
You're still talking.
Yes, I am.

15:56.189 --> 15:58.158
VIVIAN:
Okay, let's get you to bed.

15:58.191 --> 16:00.193
Rain check?

16:00.227 --> 16:01.528
Of course. (chuckles)

16:04.064 --> 16:05.498
You little...

16:05.532 --> 16:08.035
uh, cutie! (chuckles)

16:08.068 --> 16:09.169
Hope you feel better

16:09.202 --> 16:10.737
soon, mm-hmm.

16:10.770 --> 16:12.439
(sighs)

16:19.112 --> 16:21.214
(sighs)
(door opens)

16:22.382 --> 16:23.483
Hey.

16:23.516 --> 16:25.552
I come with
peace offerings.

16:25.585 --> 16:27.354
Little powdered sugar ones.

16:27.387 --> 16:28.755
Thanks.

16:28.788 --> 16:30.490
I, uh,

16:30.523 --> 16:32.092
I'm sorry.

16:32.125 --> 16:33.426
Last night was just...

16:33.460 --> 16:35.128
I know. That kid.

16:35.162 --> 16:37.497
He poked and he prodded,
and he poked where he prodded.

16:37.530 --> 16:39.766
Yeah. On the bright side,
looks like young Harley

16:39.799 --> 16:41.768
has a promising future as
a CIA interrogator.

16:41.801 --> 16:44.437
(chuckles)
But I will say, he
did make me realize

16:44.471 --> 16:46.139
that we need to get out

16:46.173 --> 16:47.807
of this place.
Oh, agreed,

16:47.840 --> 16:49.176
but I'm not moving
to the bug house.

16:49.209 --> 16:50.243
Well, I'm not going
to show tunes-ville.

16:50.277 --> 16:52.279
Well, then I guess we need
Aunt Winifred's house,

16:52.312 --> 16:54.214
'cause it's the only one
that we agree on.

16:54.247 --> 16:58.151
I'm about to hear a long,
cuckoo plan right now, right?

16:58.185 --> 17:00.420
No, the plan is very simple.

17:00.453 --> 17:02.089
See, we have Vivian
get us invited

17:02.122 --> 17:03.323
to Aunt Winifred's
crab boil today,

17:03.356 --> 17:05.291
and we win Aunt Winifred over,
and she rents us her house.

17:05.325 --> 17:07.560
But how do we get her
to like two New Yorkers?

17:07.594 --> 17:09.128
I'll figure something out.

17:09.162 --> 17:11.263
Or we'll wing it.

17:11.298 --> 17:13.266
I swear, it's like you
and Lavon have the same brain.

17:13.300 --> 17:15.202
Yeah, we're thinking
about changing the town's motto

17:15.234 --> 17:17.270
to "It's so crazy,
it just might work."

17:17.304 --> 17:18.605
But you have to say it
like that.

17:18.637 --> 17:19.806
(grunts)

17:19.839 --> 17:20.740
Well,

17:20.772 --> 17:23.210
at least one of us got
a good night's sleep!

17:23.242 --> 17:25.545
Too bad it's not the one who's
got to save BlueBell today.

17:25.578 --> 17:27.280
(groans)
Lavon, what is going on?

17:27.314 --> 17:28.381
Well, that's what
I'd like to know.

17:28.415 --> 17:30.550
I-I just spent the night
trying to keep Lynly's tears

17:30.583 --> 17:32.185
from flooding my guest house.

17:32.219 --> 17:33.320
Wait, what?

17:33.353 --> 17:34.387
Hold on.

17:35.588 --> 17:37.157
Why?

17:37.190 --> 17:38.425
Because you're
breaking up with her.

17:38.458 --> 17:40.360
Never said anything
about breaking up.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.829
Though, truth be told,
I might be having some doubts,

17:42.862 --> 17:43.796
some serious doubts.

17:43.830 --> 17:45.832
I don't know if you've seen
Tansy recently,

17:45.865 --> 17:48.601
but in a nutshell,
very bad hair day.

17:48.635 --> 17:50.303
I don't want to talk about hair!

17:50.337 --> 17:52.639
The lieutenant governor arrives
in half an hour.

17:52.672 --> 17:54.407
I need things to go perfectly.

17:54.441 --> 17:56.109
I understand that.
Well, good,

17:56.143 --> 17:57.844
'cause you and Lynly
are supposed to be stationed

17:57.877 --> 18:00.380
at the Rammer Jammer
showing love and diversity

18:00.413 --> 18:02.215
in the historic context

18:02.249 --> 18:04.251
and celebrating the anniversary
of your first kiss.

18:04.284 --> 18:06.186
All right, Lavon, I don't know
if I made myself clear,

18:06.219 --> 18:08.455
but me and Lynly, not exactly
in a kissing zone right now.

18:08.488 --> 18:09.856
So...
Call her.

18:09.889 --> 18:11.491
Apologize. Fate of BlueBell.

18:16.363 --> 18:18.198
Joel, hey, big news.

18:18.231 --> 18:20.267
Okay, so we are officially
invited to the crab boil,

18:20.300 --> 18:22.302
and I know, I was thinking
that maybe you could

18:22.335 --> 18:23.903
fake a seizure at dinner,
because Aunt Winifred

18:23.936 --> 18:26.173
would be super impressed
watching me save someone's life.

18:26.206 --> 18:27.440
Right.

18:27.474 --> 18:28.641
I'll keep thinking.

18:28.675 --> 18:30.243
(chuckles)

18:30.277 --> 18:31.344
Hey.

18:31.378 --> 18:33.213
Don't say anything.

18:33.246 --> 18:34.381
Okay.

18:34.414 --> 18:36.283
It's not that
you're more likable.

18:36.316 --> 18:39.219
Just apparently Aunt Winifred
is a New York-ist.

18:39.252 --> 18:41.588
You know, somewhere I have about
eight billion retorts to that,

18:41.621 --> 18:44.391
but, um, right now I got
my own Wilkes problem.

18:44.424 --> 18:45.558
That you do.

18:45.592 --> 18:48.361
Little Harley sure
is a stubborn kid.

18:48.395 --> 18:49.396
Yeah, tell me about it.

18:49.429 --> 18:51.298
My life is being ruined
by a cranky eight-year-old

18:51.331 --> 18:52.632
and his talking lizard.

18:52.665 --> 18:54.667
My life is being ruined
by a cranky aunt

18:54.701 --> 18:56.369
and her bias
against the zip codes.

18:58.371 --> 19:00.640
You know,
I could talk to Winifred

19:00.673 --> 19:01.908
if you...

19:01.941 --> 19:03.410
Wade Kinsella,

19:03.443 --> 19:05.512
are you asking me
to do you a favor?

19:05.545 --> 19:07.380
No, ma'am. (chuckles)

19:07.414 --> 19:11.384
No, I'm simply asking
for a mutual exchanging of...

19:11.418 --> 19:13.253
well, yeah, favors.

19:13.286 --> 19:15.488
You know, you talk me up,
I talk you up.

19:15.522 --> 19:16.623
It's win-win.

19:16.656 --> 19:18.458
You really like her, huh?

19:18.491 --> 19:19.659
More than I've liked anyone

19:19.692 --> 19:21.361
since a flaky New Yorker
blew into town,

19:21.394 --> 19:22.362
and, oh, yeah, ruined my life.

19:22.395 --> 19:26.266
But I promise I won't
share that with Aunt Win.

19:26.299 --> 19:27.400
(clears throat)

19:27.434 --> 19:28.601
You got yourself a deal.

19:29.602 --> 19:32.672
(clapping)
Everybody, smiles on.

19:32.705 --> 19:36.243
The lieutenant governor is here,
and he's very handsome.

19:44.317 --> 19:45.752
The governor's sister
really couldn't stop

19:45.785 --> 19:47.420
talking about BlueBell.

19:47.454 --> 19:50.457
Said it was one of the most
charming towns she'd ever seen.

19:50.490 --> 19:51.724
Oh, well, uh, thank you.

19:51.758 --> 19:53.626
You know, we also
pride ourselves

19:53.660 --> 19:56.363
on our importance to
the state's history.

19:56.396 --> 19:57.464
And how's that?

19:57.497 --> 20:00.233
(gasps) Lieutenant
Governor Byrd.

20:00.267 --> 20:03.470
The historic BlueBell Belles
welcome you to BlueBell.

20:03.503 --> 20:06.339
We made the "Gazebos of Alabama"
calendar this year.

20:06.373 --> 20:08.241
BlueBell's gazebo has stood

20:08.275 --> 20:10.643
for 167 years.

20:10.677 --> 20:12.312
Weathered Katrina,

20:12.345 --> 20:15.648
countless storms, and witnessed
hundreds of proposals,

20:15.682 --> 20:17.450
including my own. (chuckles)

20:17.484 --> 20:19.386
Well, that is sweet,

20:19.419 --> 20:22.555
if not quite historic.

20:23.623 --> 20:25.525
Mayor Hayes,

20:25.558 --> 20:28.728
isn't this
the most beautiful day?

20:28.761 --> 20:30.997
Like every day in BlueBell.

20:31.030 --> 20:32.399
Uh, this is Frank.

20:32.432 --> 20:33.733
His roots in town

20:33.766 --> 20:36.336
go back five generations.

20:36.369 --> 20:37.604
He owns the Dixie Stop,

20:37.637 --> 20:39.772
our local grocery.
You know, my grandfather

20:39.806 --> 20:43.676
invented the apple fritter
right in our kitchen.

20:43.710 --> 20:47.314
I believe Winchell's
invented the apple fritter.

20:47.347 --> 20:48.348
(chuckles)

20:48.381 --> 20:49.716
I'm a bit of
a history buff.

20:49.749 --> 20:51.418
Mayor Hayes, good morrow!

20:51.451 --> 20:53.052
Ah, well,

20:53.085 --> 20:56.589
if it isn't another one
of BlueBell's happy couples.

20:56.623 --> 20:58.425
Uh, this is, uh, Dr. Zoe Hart,

20:58.458 --> 21:01.428
and, uh, and BlueBell's very
first best-selling novelist,

21:01.461 --> 21:02.562
Joel Stephens.
Nice to meet you.

21:02.595 --> 21:05.765
Actually, my second novel
has been greatly inspired

21:05.798 --> 21:08.668
by BlueBell's unique
small-town culture.

21:08.701 --> 21:10.303
(clears throat)

21:10.337 --> 21:11.371
And rich history.

21:11.404 --> 21:12.639
Have you seen the gazebo?

21:12.672 --> 21:13.773
I-I have.

21:13.806 --> 21:15.575
Lavon, Lavon, Lavon, sorry.

21:15.608 --> 21:16.643
Okay, real quick.

21:16.676 --> 21:18.678
You know I am here for you 100%.

21:18.711 --> 21:19.746
Go, BlueBell.

21:19.779 --> 21:21.548
But would it be
okay if Joel and I

21:21.581 --> 21:23.483
ducked out of town this
afternoon with Wade and Vivian

21:23.516 --> 21:25.051
to go to my Aunt Winifred's
crab boil?

21:25.084 --> 21:27.720
Well, look, I need everything
to go smoothly today.

21:27.754 --> 21:30.390
So you leaving with Wade
and Joel, not a problem.

21:30.423 --> 21:31.691
Hey...

21:31.724 --> 21:34.327
I'll try not to let that
insult me.

21:38.731 --> 21:40.700
Hey, Shelby,

21:40.733 --> 21:41.834
I got your text.

21:41.868 --> 21:43.736
W-What's the emergency?

21:43.770 --> 21:45.438
Oh, it's not the baby, is it?

21:45.472 --> 21:47.440
You know that I'm not an actual
medical professional, don't you?

21:47.474 --> 21:49.809
It's not an emergency per se.

21:49.842 --> 21:52.479
I'm just starving,

21:52.512 --> 21:54.414
and there is nothing
to eat here.

21:54.447 --> 21:55.682
And Brick is on a house call.

21:55.715 --> 21:57.717
(chuckling):
Why don't you just go into town?

21:57.750 --> 21:59.552
I can't.

21:59.586 --> 22:01.488
I'm avoiding somebody.

22:01.521 --> 22:03.089
Who?

22:03.122 --> 22:05.458
Ugh.

22:05.492 --> 22:07.460
The lieutenant governor.

22:07.494 --> 22:08.728
What? Why?

22:08.761 --> 22:10.897
If you must know,
we slept together.

22:11.898 --> 22:14.333
Eight months ago.

22:15.802 --> 22:18.605
Shelby, are you telling me
that the lieutenant governor,

22:18.638 --> 22:20.473
Alex Byrd, is your baby daddy?

22:30.483 --> 22:33.119
(indistinct chatter)

22:33.152 --> 22:34.687
JOEL:
That smells great.

22:34.721 --> 22:36.122
Focus. We are
on a mission.

22:36.155 --> 22:38.425
(sighs) Can't we go
to one Wilkes family event

22:38.458 --> 22:40.760
without some Jane Austen-like
social manipulation plan?

22:40.793 --> 22:42.595
You know, normally I'd agree
with you, but I really

22:42.629 --> 22:44.564
don't want to be murdered
in my sleep by that lizard.

22:44.597 --> 22:46.132
Jane Austen--
that name sounds familiar.

22:46.165 --> 22:47.534
Did I sleep with her?

22:47.567 --> 22:48.601
VIVIAN:
Hi!

22:48.635 --> 22:49.636
WADE:
Hey!

22:50.770 --> 22:52.439
Oh.

22:52.472 --> 22:53.806
You guys really came.

22:53.840 --> 22:55.742
This is gonna be interesting.
WOMAN:
Wade!

22:55.775 --> 22:56.909
Come here!
Give me some sugar.

22:56.943 --> 22:58.911
For you, two lumps, Aunt Win.

22:58.945 --> 23:00.580
Come here.

23:00.613 --> 23:02.615
Well, she doesn't
 seem intolerant.

23:02.649 --> 23:03.750
Oh, well, just you wait.

23:03.783 --> 23:05.418
(clears throat)
Winifred,

23:05.452 --> 23:07.654
come here.
I'm delighted

23:07.687 --> 23:09.188
to introduce you
to your niece,

23:09.221 --> 23:11.491
Zoe Hart, and her
boyfriend Joel Stephens.

23:11.524 --> 23:12.892
Hi. It's nice to meet you.

23:12.925 --> 23:14.627
You have a great yard.

23:14.661 --> 23:17.497
Yeah, we brought some
garlic-butter sauce
for the crabs.

23:17.530 --> 23:18.898
Well, of course you did.

23:18.931 --> 23:21.568
New Yorkers always know
how to do things better.

23:21.601 --> 23:23.603
What? No, I-I...

23:23.636 --> 23:25.572
You bring silverware, too?
No need-- us cowpokes,

23:25.605 --> 23:26.873
we just eat with our hands.

23:26.906 --> 23:28.475
If you'll excuse me.

23:28.508 --> 23:30.477
I don't need that.
(laughs)

23:30.510 --> 23:31.578
(brief chuckle)

23:31.611 --> 23:33.212
WADE:
Hey, bud, got you this.

23:33.245 --> 23:35.748
It's a cement mixer.
(chuckles)

23:37.216 --> 23:39.719
Cecil says he's gonna use it
to mix up your brain.

23:39.752 --> 23:41.554
Oh.

23:43.723 --> 23:45.758
Hey, Aunt Win! Let's hang!

23:45.792 --> 23:47.794
Harley, buddy, let's talk!

23:50.630 --> 23:51.531
Of course I lied.

23:51.564 --> 23:53.700
Telling people I got
preggo by a sperm donor

23:53.733 --> 23:54.934
sounds a lot better
than saying

23:54.967 --> 23:56.969
I got knocked up
by some complete stranger

23:57.003 --> 23:58.705
after seven
tequila slammers.

23:58.738 --> 23:59.939
(loud slap)

23:59.972 --> 24:01.774
Yeah, I guess
that's true.

24:01.808 --> 24:04.677
AnnaBeth, this
is our secret.

24:04.711 --> 24:06.513
Take it to the grave.

24:06.546 --> 24:07.647
Promise.

24:07.680 --> 24:09.949
Of course, but...

24:09.982 --> 24:14.253
maybe this is fate giving you
a second chance to come clean.

24:14.286 --> 24:16.022
Tell Lieutenant
Governor Byrd

24:16.055 --> 24:17.824
that he's about to
have a chickadee.

24:17.857 --> 24:19.759
No, siree.

24:19.792 --> 24:21.694
What happens in Vegas--

24:21.728 --> 24:25.698
or in this case, a deluxe double
at the Mobile Inn-- no.

24:25.732 --> 24:27.900
I am staying in this house

24:27.934 --> 24:29.836
until the lieutenant
governor leaves town.

24:29.869 --> 24:31.938
I just need someone
to get me donuts.

24:31.971 --> 24:35.742
Fine. I'm not one
to be all pushy.

24:36.876 --> 24:39.946
But before you eat yourself
into a sugar coma,

24:39.979 --> 24:41.714
just... consider this.

24:41.748 --> 24:45.051
One day, that child
is gonna ask about their dad.

24:45.084 --> 24:47.286
Are you sure you're
gonna be okay saying,

24:47.319 --> 24:49.822
"Sorry, daughter-- or son--

24:49.856 --> 24:52.759
but your dad
doesn't even know you exist"?

24:56.929 --> 24:58.665
WADE:
Hey, Aunt Win.

24:58.698 --> 25:00.867
Uh, you know,
Joel and Zoe may seem

25:00.900 --> 25:01.834
like your basic Manhattanites,

25:01.868 --> 25:04.270
but Zoe gave up
a very fancy surgical career

25:04.303 --> 25:06.038
in New York
to move back down here.

25:06.072 --> 25:07.574
And I know for a fact

25:07.607 --> 25:08.941
that her favorite movie
of all time--

25:08.975 --> 25:11.010
Sweet Home Alabama. Yeah.
Oh.

25:11.043 --> 25:13.279
You know who else loves
 Sweet Home Alabama?

25:13.312 --> 25:15.014
My ex, Donna, from Brooklyn.

25:15.047 --> 25:16.048
ZOE:
Did you know

25:16.082 --> 25:17.617
that my pal Wade has

25:17.650 --> 25:20.620
a massive collection
of video games?

25:20.653 --> 25:24.290
Cecil says video games turn
people into demented sociopaths.

25:24.323 --> 25:28.661
I'm not sure that research
backs Cecil up, but...

25:33.032 --> 25:33.966
(clears throat)

25:34.000 --> 25:35.735
Look at that Zoe Hart,

25:35.768 --> 25:37.704
just schmoozing with
my little Harley.

25:37.737 --> 25:39.338
After how she ruined
his birthday.

25:39.371 --> 25:41.040
Hey, do you like
root beer floats?

25:41.073 --> 25:42.108
Cecil does.

25:42.141 --> 25:44.343
Do you know who
makes great ones?

25:44.376 --> 25:46.879
You're gonna say Wade, right?

25:46.913 --> 25:49.649
(quiet sigh)

25:52.819 --> 25:55.622
Y-You know what?
Zoe's not perfect, all right?

25:55.655 --> 25:57.323
She-she gets these ideas
in her head,

25:57.356 --> 25:59.759
and most of the time
they're just plain nutso.

25:59.792 --> 26:01.327
(laughs)
But almost always,

26:01.360 --> 26:02.962
they come from
a place of wanting

26:02.995 --> 26:04.864
to do things
for the people she loves.

26:04.897 --> 26:07.667
If it looks like I'm trying
to sell you on 'em,

26:07.700 --> 26:08.801
it's 'cause I am.

26:08.835 --> 26:11.137
And it's not for her sake,
but for yours.

26:11.170 --> 26:13.339
Honestly, you'd be lucky to call
people like those family.

26:13.372 --> 26:14.440
ZOE:
 You know what?

26:14.473 --> 26:17.009
I didn't like Wade, either,
when I first met him.

26:17.043 --> 26:18.845
He is an acquired taste.

26:18.878 --> 26:23.082
But he is a good guy
with a huge heart.

26:23.115 --> 26:25.852
And one of the best
fort builders I ever met.

26:25.885 --> 26:27.987
And I know you like forts.

26:28.020 --> 26:30.389
WINIFRED:
Zo, where you been hiding?

26:30.422 --> 26:32.792
Why don't you grab
your boyfriend

26:32.825 --> 26:34.994
and that butter sauce
you been bragging about,

26:35.027 --> 26:36.896
and come to my table.
Come on.

26:38.931 --> 26:40.099
WINIFRED:
Come on.

26:40.132 --> 26:41.834
HARLEY:
Hey, Wade.

26:41.868 --> 26:44.871
Is it true that you know
how to build a really cool fort?

26:44.904 --> 26:47.774
Do I know how to build a fort?
(chuckles)

26:47.807 --> 26:50.076
Buster, have you
ever heard of the Alamo?

26:50.109 --> 26:52.712
Uh-huh.
Guess who built that.
Me, that's who.

26:52.745 --> 26:53.713
Really?

26:53.746 --> 26:54.814
Yeah.
Awesome!

26:57.750 --> 26:59.686
WADE: So, anyway,
what you start with...

27:00.720 --> 27:02.722
(bell tinkles)

27:04.957 --> 27:06.693
BRICK:
AnnaBeth, good news.

27:06.726 --> 27:08.795
I have solved the mystery
as to why Shelby's been

27:08.828 --> 27:10.697
so out of sorts
the last couple of days.

27:10.730 --> 27:13.733
What? Shelby's
out of sorts?

27:13.766 --> 27:17.003
Hey. This is her first baby,
and she just wants me

27:17.036 --> 27:20.006
to get in that excited zone
with her, you know.

27:20.039 --> 27:21.908
Yep, that sounds like...

27:21.941 --> 27:23.910
you've solved the
mystery, all right.

27:23.943 --> 27:26.913
(chuckles)
And I got her the cutest
onesie you have ever seen.

27:26.946 --> 27:29.648
Oh, come on, give me
a hand wrapping it, will you?

27:33.753 --> 27:36.723
Don't look at me like that.

27:36.756 --> 27:39.158
Wow. Thanks, Wade.
Yeah!

27:39.191 --> 27:41.660
This Alamo
is awesome.

27:43.029 --> 27:45.164
How do you get in?
Well, duh--

27:45.197 --> 27:47.433
like all the best forts...

27:47.466 --> 27:49.468
secret entrance. Ho!

27:49.501 --> 27:50.737
Cool!

27:50.770 --> 27:52.939
No? All right.
Hey, uh,

27:52.972 --> 27:55.174
man your battle station,
little man, and... hey,

27:55.207 --> 27:57.043
let me, uh, lighten
your load for you.

27:57.076 --> 27:59.846
Your mom'll get mad if you
get stuck in there. (chuckles)

28:01.881 --> 28:03.449
WADE:
Pretty cool, huh?

28:03.482 --> 28:04.984
Yeah.

28:06.152 --> 28:09.488
(quietly):
Crap on a crap stick.

28:09.521 --> 28:12.792
WANDA:
 Lavon's coming
 with the lieutenant governor,

28:12.825 --> 28:16.863
so get ready to be historical
and charming and spontaneous,

28:16.896 --> 28:18.230
like we rehearsed.

28:19.231 --> 28:20.900
I'm so glad you called.

28:20.933 --> 28:23.469
Now we can put this thing
with Tansy behind us.

28:23.502 --> 28:25.204
I knew you'd believe me.
Yep, yep,

28:25.237 --> 28:27.473
it's just, uh, you know,
it's water under the bridge.

28:27.506 --> 28:29.075
We don't even have
to talk about it.

28:29.108 --> 28:30.209
We can just focus on...

28:30.242 --> 28:32.211
saving BlueBell.
Oh, great--

28:32.244 --> 28:33.880
our anniversary couple's here.

28:33.913 --> 28:35.982
Tansy, I am truly sorry

28:36.015 --> 28:38.484
about the unfortunate,
um, follicle incident.

28:38.517 --> 28:39.819
But even George here
can attest

28:39.852 --> 28:41.788
to the fact that it
was an accident.

28:41.821 --> 28:43.956
Does "attest" mean
what I think it means?

28:43.990 --> 28:45.491
For your sake, I hope not.

28:45.524 --> 28:47.093
Oh, look,

28:47.126 --> 28:48.895
there's Lavon and the
lieutenant governor.

28:48.928 --> 28:49.896
Time to save BlueBell.

28:49.929 --> 28:52.264
You have that anniversary
milkshake for us?

28:52.298 --> 28:54.500
Coming right up.
And I can almost certainly

28:54.533 --> 28:57.236
attest to the fact
that no one's gonna spit in it.

28:57.269 --> 29:00.072
WANDA: Welcome
to BlueBell's very own

29:00.106 --> 29:02.008
unique Rammer Jammer,

29:02.041 --> 29:05.144
built on the site
of the original Rammer Jammer.

29:06.545 --> 29:09.015
I-Isn't this
the original Rammer Jammer?

29:10.049 --> 29:11.283
Exactly.

29:11.317 --> 29:13.853
Hallowed ground.

29:13.886 --> 29:16.155
Whoa. Uh, hey,
what-what have we here?

29:16.188 --> 29:18.157
(clears throat)
The Rammer Jammer

29:18.190 --> 29:19.926
would like to
congratulate

29:19.959 --> 29:21.093
Gullible George Tucker

29:21.127 --> 29:23.029
and Crazy Eyes Lynly
on the six-week

29:23.062 --> 29:25.197
anniversary of their first kiss.

29:25.231 --> 29:28.334
OTHERS:
Happy anniversary!
Tansy, that's my cousin.

29:28.367 --> 29:30.269
Such unusual nicknames.

29:30.302 --> 29:31.938
Where do they come from?

29:31.971 --> 29:34.006
LAVON:
Oh, um, handed down

29:34.040 --> 29:36.542
generation after
generation.

29:36.575 --> 29:38.878
Ask about the part where I
smelled something burning

29:38.911 --> 29:40.980
and she said it was
 popcorn. (laughs)

29:41.013 --> 29:43.149
Is that true what she
just said about the popcorn?

29:43.182 --> 29:44.851
That's what it
smelled like to me.

29:44.884 --> 29:46.886
Well, popcorn and human hair
smell completely different.

29:46.919 --> 29:49.255
Of course you'd believe her.
Why don't you just admit it,

29:49.288 --> 29:52.091
you still have feelings for her.
 That's what this is all about.

29:52.124 --> 29:53.325
No, no, no.
That's not what I said.

29:53.359 --> 29:54.593
Lynly, listen
to me. No, no.

29:54.626 --> 29:56.162
Lynly, please don't cry.
Please don't cry.

29:56.195 --> 29:57.163
Okay, smile. Hey.

29:57.196 --> 29:58.564
(nervous chuckle)

29:58.597 --> 30:00.132
OTHERS (chanting):
Kiss! Kiss!

30:00.166 --> 30:01.968
Are-are they gonna kiss?

30:02.001 --> 30:04.070
'Cause this is starting
to get oddly uncomfortable.

30:04.103 --> 30:06.906
Oh, no, don't-don't worry,
they're gonna kiss.

30:06.939 --> 30:10.342
OTHERS (chanting):
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

30:10.376 --> 30:12.912
(chanting continues)

30:12.945 --> 30:14.947
(applause)

30:19.418 --> 30:21.620
An historic moment.

30:21.653 --> 30:24.957
Uh... let's get you
a seat outside.

30:24.991 --> 30:26.192
(chuckles)

30:26.225 --> 30:27.626
(panting):
Hi.

30:27.659 --> 30:30.229
Lieutenant Governor Byrd,
I was wondering if you'd

30:30.262 --> 30:32.198
be interested in seeing
my antique commode.

30:32.231 --> 30:33.599
Tom, not now.

30:33.632 --> 30:34.600
My Great-Great-
Great Grandma

30:34.633 --> 30:37.269
Ernestine had one of
the first indoor toilets.

30:37.303 --> 30:39.071
When Andrew Jackson
came to Alabama

30:39.105 --> 30:41.140
to commemorate the Battle
of Horseshoe Bend,

30:41.173 --> 30:42.942
nature called. (laughs)

30:42.975 --> 30:45.144
She had him carve
his name in the seat.

30:45.177 --> 30:47.113
Andrew Jackson?

30:47.146 --> 30:49.115
Now, that's historic.

30:49.148 --> 30:50.216
What'd I say?

30:50.249 --> 30:52.284
Uh, okay.

30:57.656 --> 30:59.625
We need to talk.

30:59.658 --> 31:01.360
(crying):
Don't say it.

31:01.393 --> 31:03.162
Don't you dare say it.

31:05.264 --> 31:08.367
Oh, I apologize--
I did misjudge you two.

31:08.400 --> 31:11.070
Oh, no, that's okay.
We misjudge people
all the time.

31:11.103 --> 31:13.072
And I hear you're
looking for a house.

31:13.105 --> 31:15.107
I have a rental-- it
just might be perfect.

31:15.141 --> 31:16.208
I've been
looking for...

31:16.242 --> 31:18.410
just the right sort
of tenants. Mm, mm!
Really?!

31:18.444 --> 31:20.646
Yes!
Oh, my gosh,
that would just be...

31:20.679 --> 31:22.681
Hey, Doc, can I...
borrow you

31:22.714 --> 31:26.085
for a sec?
Aunt Winifred is telling us
about the house. Can it wait?

31:26.118 --> 31:28.187
No, it really can't.
Why? (gasps)

31:29.688 --> 31:31.991
I lost the rest
of Harley's lizard.

31:41.333 --> 31:45.037
Marian Matthews was right--
this town is special.

31:45.071 --> 31:48.074
And I love the...
historic commode.

31:48.107 --> 31:49.208
Yeah.

31:49.241 --> 31:52.711
Point is, if BlueBell
is looking for historic status

31:52.744 --> 31:54.981
to prevent this merger
with Fillmore...

31:55.014 --> 31:56.983
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God...
well...

31:57.016 --> 31:59.185
show me where to sign.

31:59.218 --> 32:02.121
Whoa! Hot damn!
I happen to have
Yes! (laughs)

32:02.154 --> 32:04.290
the paperwork right here.
(chuckles)

32:04.323 --> 32:05.992
And your choice of pens.

32:06.025 --> 32:08.094
SHELBY (chuckles):
Not a robber.

32:08.127 --> 32:09.428
Just me, Shelby.

32:09.461 --> 32:11.063
Shelby, can this wait?

32:11.097 --> 32:12.698
What the hell's going on?
SHELBY:
This will

32:12.731 --> 32:14.700
only take a moment. I'm taking
your good advice to heart.

32:14.733 --> 32:17.269
Lieutenant
Governor Byrd,

32:17.303 --> 32:19.038
it's been a while,
but hi.

32:19.071 --> 32:20.072
Remember me?

32:20.106 --> 32:22.108
Shelby, we are right
in the middle...
Wait-wait.

32:22.141 --> 32:24.210
The Mobile Inn.

32:24.243 --> 32:25.477
Exactly. Bingo.

32:25.511 --> 32:27.046
Excellent memory.

32:27.079 --> 32:30.449
Wow, what was that, uh...
eight months ago?

32:30.482 --> 32:32.484
Oh, no.

32:33.485 --> 32:35.454
Oh, boy.
Or girl.

32:35.487 --> 32:37.023
I'm not sure which yet.

32:37.056 --> 32:38.457
Anyhoo,
I want to make it

32:38.490 --> 32:40.392
very clear that I
am not expecting

32:40.426 --> 32:42.028
commitment
or financial support.

32:42.061 --> 32:44.196
I just thought it was right
to let you know

32:44.230 --> 32:46.132
that I am carrying
the child

32:46.165 --> 32:48.067
that we made together
with the help

32:48.100 --> 32:49.768
of our friends,
vodka and tequila.

32:49.801 --> 32:52.071
Okay, then.

32:52.104 --> 32:53.405
On with your business.

32:57.109 --> 32:58.344
(clears throat)

32:58.377 --> 33:02.981
Maybe sign the paperwork first,
then process what just happened.

33:05.251 --> 33:07.053
Or not.

33:07.086 --> 33:09.288
That salamander was
Harley's best friend.

33:09.321 --> 33:12.091
How could you guys lose him?
Well, in good news,

33:12.124 --> 33:14.360
I once dated a veterinarian
who told me that salamanders,

33:14.393 --> 33:16.095
they regenerate
their tails.

33:16.128 --> 33:17.363
Yeah, thanks for the backup,
okay, but Cecil

33:17.396 --> 33:18.530
took off for the hills,
all right?

33:18.564 --> 33:20.166
A-And telling
a kid that, oh,

33:20.199 --> 33:21.367
at least his tail's
gonna grown back

33:21.400 --> 33:22.334
isn't gonna make him
feel any better.

33:22.368 --> 33:25.204
Yeah, well,
we better figure out what will.

33:25.237 --> 33:27.239
Mom, Cecil's gone.

33:27.273 --> 33:29.241
Oh, sweetie, I know.
Maybe he'll come back.

33:29.275 --> 33:31.510
Maybe he'll love
being free and unshackled.

33:31.543 --> 33:34.813
HARLEY:
Cecil is a pet. He'll get eaten.

33:34.846 --> 33:37.149
I knew I never should
have put my backpack down.

33:37.183 --> 33:38.384
It's all my fault.

33:38.417 --> 33:40.252
Whoa, no, no,

33:40.286 --> 33:41.820
no, buddy.
Uh, look,

33:41.853 --> 33:43.389
there's something
I should tell you.

33:43.422 --> 33:44.823
It's not your fault

33:44.856 --> 33:46.325
Cecil took off, okay? It's...

33:46.358 --> 33:48.094
ZOE:
It's mine. Yeah.

33:48.127 --> 33:50.129
You know, I-I was
looking for lip balm,

33:50.162 --> 33:51.330
and I saw your backpack

33:51.363 --> 33:54.133
on the ground, so-so I thought,
maybe there's some in there,

33:54.166 --> 33:55.467
and I unzipped it,

33:55.501 --> 33:57.836
and Cecil, he just--
whoosh!-- he just ran out.

33:57.869 --> 34:01.207
And I tried to catch him,
but... man, he's fast.

34:01.240 --> 34:04.310
So after rooting through a
backpack that isn't yours,

34:04.343 --> 34:05.544
looking for
lip balm, you lose

34:05.577 --> 34:06.845
an eight-year-old's
beloved pet,

34:06.878 --> 34:08.447
and you don't bother
to tell anyone till now?

34:08.480 --> 34:10.815
(softly):
When my lips are really dry...

34:10.849 --> 34:12.583
sometimes
I have trouble talking.

34:12.618 --> 34:15.554
Ah. Just like my ex, Shaquira--
from Queens!

34:15.587 --> 34:18.224
She had dry lips, too-- and
no regard for anyone else.

34:18.257 --> 34:21.427
There will be no house for you.

34:21.460 --> 34:23.562
Mm-mm!

34:23.594 --> 34:25.397
I hate you.

34:25.431 --> 34:26.864
(sighs)

34:26.898 --> 34:28.400
(knocking)

34:28.434 --> 34:30.335
Hey.

34:30.369 --> 34:32.603
(sighs)
Can we talk?

34:38.409 --> 34:40.246
Look, Lynly, I...
Look...

34:40.279 --> 34:43.315
maybe I did, subconsciously,
burn Tansy's hair off,

34:43.349 --> 34:45.417
but it's only
because I saw

34:45.451 --> 34:47.585
the two of you on the
boat deck the other night,

34:47.619 --> 34:50.255
and I knew... you were
gonna want her back.

34:50.289 --> 34:52.158
Wow.

34:52.190 --> 34:55.261
So that's what started all this?

34:55.293 --> 34:56.895
Look, Lynly,

34:56.928 --> 34:59.665
yes, Tansy and I do have history

34:59.698 --> 35:01.867
and that doesn't just go away,

35:01.900 --> 35:04.470
but that was nothing,
and I'm sorry if you

35:04.503 --> 35:06.305
got hurt at all by what you saw.

35:06.338 --> 35:09.375
You warned me from the start
that you were damaged goods.

35:10.409 --> 35:11.510
Yes, I did,

35:11.543 --> 35:14.480
but...
Guess the fact that
I burned Tansy's hair off

35:14.513 --> 35:17.416
means I'm still
kind of damaged myself.

35:18.950 --> 35:21.187
Boy, my parents
are gonna be mad.

35:21.220 --> 35:24.156
Well, you know what,
you could feel free

35:24.190 --> 35:26.392
to just blame it all
on me, okay?

35:26.425 --> 35:28.527
Oh, I will.
(chuckles)

35:30.362 --> 35:33.265
Look, for whatever
it's worth, Lynly,

35:33.299 --> 35:36.302
you really did bring me
back to life, and...

35:36.335 --> 35:39.638
for that, I will be
forever grateful to you.

35:39.671 --> 35:42.208
See?

35:42.241 --> 35:44.910
Maybe I was
your Band-Aid after all.

35:44.943 --> 35:46.678
Yeah.

35:47.713 --> 35:51.149
I'll call Lavon from Houston.

35:53.952 --> 35:56.355
Good-bye, George Tucker.

35:57.389 --> 35:59.258
Good-bye, Lynly Hayes.

36:03.495 --> 36:04.696
(door closes)

36:17.709 --> 36:20.246
Should I get him
another pen?

36:20.279 --> 36:23.382
Why? He's just gonna use it
to stir his scotch.

36:23.415 --> 36:25.284
So, we got...

36:25.317 --> 36:26.552
baby-bombed.

36:26.585 --> 36:28.186
Of course, so did he.

36:29.488 --> 36:31.990
Well, I guess
we should check on him.

36:32.023 --> 36:35.294
See if he wants another scotch.

36:35.327 --> 36:36.728
(sighs)

36:43.302 --> 36:44.970
How we doing?

36:45.003 --> 36:48.307
I went to Mobile
for a recycling convention,

36:48.340 --> 36:50.776
and... made a baby.

36:52.344 --> 36:55.381
A baby I'll probably
never see or know or...

36:55.414 --> 36:56.982
Well, look, I know
that Shelby said

36:57.015 --> 36:58.550
she didn't expect
you to help

36:58.584 --> 37:00.386
in the raising of
the baby, but...

37:00.419 --> 37:02.621
It doesn't mean
she won't accept it.

37:04.055 --> 37:06.558
Don't suppose y'all know
where she is?

37:15.534 --> 37:17.669
(Wade imitates roaring engine,
screeching tires)

37:19.705 --> 37:21.373
Hey, dude.

37:21.407 --> 37:24.042
Listen, I-I know you're probably
plotting Zoe Hart's demise

37:24.075 --> 37:27.479
in that little head of yours--
you wouldn't be the first.

37:27.513 --> 37:30.616
But, uh, look, I'm hoping
we can be pals one day,

37:30.649 --> 37:33.452
and that's not gonna happen
unless we have honesty.

37:34.653 --> 37:36.788
So I'm gonna tell you the truth.

37:36.822 --> 37:39.325
I'm the one that lost Cecil.

37:40.692 --> 37:42.694
I should've known.

37:42.728 --> 37:44.596
Harley, look,
I'd hate me, too,

37:44.630 --> 37:46.532
if I were in your
shoes, all right?

37:46.565 --> 37:47.799
I get it.
I've been there.

37:47.833 --> 37:49.768
But just so
you know,

37:49.801 --> 37:52.538
I care a whole lot
about your mom.

37:52.571 --> 37:55.641
And because of that,
I care a lot about you, too.

37:55.674 --> 37:58.043
And losing Cecil was

37:58.076 --> 37:59.378
an accident.

37:59.411 --> 38:02.348
I am... very, very sorry.

38:02.381 --> 38:05.817
But don't waste your time
hating Zoe Hart, all right?

38:05.851 --> 38:08.554
She's gonna win you over
eventually, and...

38:08.587 --> 38:12.391
if you can help it, maybe try
not to hate me, either.

38:12.424 --> 38:14.560
ZOE:
Hey, guys!

38:14.593 --> 38:17.696
Look who we found
in the woods.

38:17.729 --> 38:19.565
(gasps)
Cecil!

38:19.598 --> 38:22.468
Oh...
Thanks, Mom.
You're the best.

38:22.501 --> 38:24.536
You're okay, too.

38:24.570 --> 38:26.838
Works for me.

38:31.843 --> 38:33.679
I guess Cecil knew a
good ice cream buddy

38:33.712 --> 38:35.113
when he found one, right?
(chuckles)

38:35.146 --> 38:38.650
Look, I'm only eight,
but I'm not stupid.

38:38.684 --> 38:40.586
This does not even

38:40.619 --> 38:42.654
look like Cecil.
What's that?

38:44.390 --> 38:47.859
Huh. Even Cecil Two
wants to kill you.

38:50.462 --> 38:52.698
Seriously?
That one talks, too?

38:52.731 --> 38:55.133
BRICK:
 You are having
 the lieutenant governor's baby?

38:55.166 --> 38:57.102
And you're doing it
in Montgomery?

38:57.135 --> 39:00.672
He just came to see me, and
he said, once the fog cleared,

39:00.706 --> 39:03.575
he realized
the only thing to do was

39:03.609 --> 39:04.876
to offer to move me
to Montgomery

39:04.910 --> 39:06.512
and help raise
the baby.

39:06.545 --> 39:08.614
His baby.
He said, if he didn't do it,

39:08.647 --> 39:10.682
he'd be kicking himself
the rest of his life.

39:10.716 --> 39:13.619
So that's... that's it, huh?

39:13.652 --> 39:15.754
You just leave, huh?

39:15.787 --> 39:18.557
Please don't be mad at me.
(exhales)

39:18.590 --> 39:20.526
I could never be mad at you.

39:20.559 --> 39:22.561
Not for long.
(chuckles)
(chuckles)

39:22.594 --> 39:25.464
You are simply the
best, Brick Breeland.

39:29.801 --> 39:31.470
(sighs)

39:35.574 --> 39:37.976
Don't be a stranger, okay?

39:39.745 --> 39:43.381
*

39:49.588 --> 39:50.889
(exhales)

39:50.922 --> 39:52.658
LAVON:
 My fellow BlueBellians,

39:52.691 --> 39:56.795
well, the irony is, uh,
today was... truly historic.

39:56.828 --> 40:01.900
L-Look, all your efforts
exceeded my expectations.

40:01.933 --> 40:04.736
I'm... sorry
I couldn't bring it home.

40:04.770 --> 40:07.706
So, while
the name BlueBell's

40:07.739 --> 40:09.441
about to be...

40:09.475 --> 40:11.843
wiped from maps
and GPS's worldwide,

40:11.877 --> 40:13.712
please know that

40:13.745 --> 40:15.614
it will never be...
Mayor Hayes,

40:15.647 --> 40:17.616
I've been looking for you.
Lieutenant Governor,

40:17.649 --> 40:19.951
I thought you'd be
headed back to Montgomery.

40:19.985 --> 40:22.521
I was on my way
when I realized...

40:22.554 --> 40:23.922
I never signed those papers

40:23.955 --> 40:25.791
to declare BlueBell
a historical landmark.

40:25.824 --> 40:28.193
What... You're
gonna stop the merger?

40:28.226 --> 40:30.696
Yes, sir.
ANNABETH:
Well, don't question the man,

40:30.729 --> 40:32.598
(laughs):
just give him a pen.

40:32.631 --> 40:34.633
Oh, yeah, uh, yeah.

40:34.666 --> 40:36.568
There you go.

40:41.907 --> 40:43.809
Hey, everybody,
the merger's off!

40:43.842 --> 40:45.844
(cheering, whooping)

40:52.784 --> 40:54.720
Who cares if Aunt Winifred
hates us

40:54.753 --> 40:56.822
and will not rent us
her stupid house?

40:56.855 --> 40:59.525
Because we get to have
no house in BlueBell!

40:59.558 --> 41:02.227
Actually, I've been thinking,
and seeing as how

41:02.260 --> 41:04.896
this is a day
of historical significance,

41:04.930 --> 41:07.533
I will cave and...

41:07.566 --> 41:09.635
live next to
Stanley and Crickett.

41:09.668 --> 41:10.902
Really?
Yeah.

41:10.936 --> 41:12.971
Oh, thank you!
You're welcome.

41:13.004 --> 41:15.774
CRICKETT and STANLEY:
* See how the Fates
their gifts allot! *

41:15.807 --> 41:18.544
* For A is happy!

41:18.577 --> 41:20.746
* B is not!

41:21.780 --> 41:23.582
Termite house it is!

41:23.615 --> 41:24.983
Oh, thank God.
We're renting a house!

41:25.016 --> 41:26.718
No, no, we're not.

41:26.752 --> 41:28.954
Termite house is for
rent or for sale.

41:28.987 --> 41:30.822
We're buying the house.

41:30.856 --> 41:33.258
Seriously?

41:33.291 --> 41:34.793
All in.

41:38.797 --> 41:39.898
Great news.

41:39.931 --> 41:41.266
Long live BlueBell.

41:41.299 --> 41:42.701
Hey.

41:42.734 --> 41:44.770
Mmm. I didn't expect
to see you tonight.

41:44.803 --> 41:46.572
Now there's two things
to celebrate.

41:46.605 --> 41:49.841
Yeah, well, Brando owes me
this sleepover with Harley,

41:49.875 --> 41:52.277
so... I figured I'd cash in.

41:52.310 --> 41:53.879
You free?

41:53.912 --> 41:55.881
Uh, hey, Wanda?

41:55.914 --> 41:57.749
You're closing tonight.
Yes, ma'am.
