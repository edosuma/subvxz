NARRATOR: Previously on Deadbeat:

00:07.485 --> 00:10.603
My guest today is celebrated
paranormal communicator,

00:10.669 --> 00:12.328
Camomile White.

00:12.395 --> 00:14.353
I see him. I see your grandfather.

00:14.419 --> 00:17.339
He died trying to save the store.

00:17.405 --> 00:19.197
I hated this place.

00:19.263 --> 00:21.254
- She just made that all up?
- WOMAN: Excuse me.

00:21.321 --> 00:23.178
We're having a moment here.

00:23.245 --> 00:26.097
Your grandfather didn't die
trying to save the store.

00:26.164 --> 00:27.624
He died trying to light it on fire.

00:29.979 --> 00:31.373
I don't know who you are.

00:31.441 --> 00:33.995
But if you ever pull a
stunt like that again...

00:39.868 --> 00:41.360
ANNOUNCER: In the
criminal justice system,

00:41.426 --> 00:42.986
there are crimes that can land you in jail

00:43.053 --> 00:44.910
for more than one year

00:44.977 --> 00:47.067
and crimes that can land you
in jail for less than one year.

00:47.133 --> 00:49.389
Or possibly just result in a small fine.

00:49.456 --> 00:52.243
These are the crimes
that could go either way.

00:54.100 --> 00:55.759
Bad news, dirtbag.

00:55.826 --> 00:58.447
That's over five hundos in stolen merch.

00:58.514 --> 01:00.205
It's grand larceny.

01:00.271 --> 01:02.496
You're going away for a long time.

01:02.761 --> 01:04.884
Detective, you're gonna wanna hear this.

01:04.950 --> 01:06.476
DETECTIVE: What do you got for me?

01:06.742 --> 01:08.069
One of the stolen items is on sale.

01:08.135 --> 01:09.728
Total value of the stolen merch is 490.

01:09.794 --> 01:11.453
It's petty theft.

01:11.718 --> 01:13.245
It's a misdemeanor.

01:13.311 --> 01:16.364
A sale item, that is genius.

01:16.629 --> 01:18.354
Where do they come up with this stuff?

01:18.620 --> 01:20.610
(Door knocking )

01:22.003 --> 01:23.828
Well, that's a dainty little knock.

01:26.051 --> 01:27.777
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm Sue

01:27.843 --> 01:29.569
from Camomile White's office?

01:29.635 --> 01:31.791
A couple of days ago,
you vomited all over her?

01:31.858 --> 01:33.915
Yeah, I remember very well.

01:33.982 --> 01:36.868
You also soiled her Pierre
le Soixante pantsuit.

01:36.934 --> 01:38.793
- Her what?
- Her pantsuit.

01:38.859 --> 01:41.911
She wanted me to give you
this dry-cleaning bill.

01:41.978 --> 01:44.598
For 25 bucks, what...?

01:44.665 --> 01:46.656
- I can't afford this, but...
- You seem like a nice guy.

01:46.721 --> 01:48.448
Just pay the bill.

01:48.513 --> 01:50.703
You do not wanna get on
this woman's bad side.

01:50.769 --> 01:53.457
Bad side? She already
kicked me in the nuts.

01:53.524 --> 01:55.481
It'll get worse. I'm sorry, I have to go.

01:55.548 --> 01:56.974
No. No, you don't.

01:57.041 --> 01:59.064
No, no, no. Listen, come
in, have some peanut butter.

01:59.131 --> 02:01.520
We'll sort it out over a nice

02:01.586 --> 02:03.942
spoonful of peanut butter.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.482

02:43.557 --> 02:45.216
What's up, Pac, how you living?

02:45.283 --> 02:47.571
Not very well, I fear, Roofie.

02:47.638 --> 02:50.458
I got this bill I can't afford.

02:50.525 --> 02:52.548
Don't know how to deal with
it, I got no one to turn to.

02:52.615 --> 02:54.606
The stress is really
having its way with me.

02:54.671 --> 02:57.391
So what are you saying is you
wanna borrow money from me?

02:57.459 --> 02:59.715
Money? No. Weed.

02:59.781 --> 03:02.170
You know, for the stress.
Were you listening?

03:02.236 --> 03:04.293
Look, Pac, I can't just
keep giving you weed.

03:04.359 --> 03:06.151
I'm a businessman.

03:06.218 --> 03:09.601
As your drug dealer, which the
idea is you pay me for drugs.

03:09.668 --> 03:12.190
Well, as my friend, can you loan
me money to pay for the drugs?

03:12.257 --> 03:13.517
How much you need?

03:13.583 --> 03:15.143
As my dealer, how much for an eighth?

03:15.209 --> 03:17.000
For a friend, 25 bucks.

03:17.067 --> 03:19.954
For 25 bucks, I could just pay
the stupid dry-cleaning bill.

03:20.020 --> 03:21.347
Roofie, can you loan me 25 bucks

03:21.414 --> 03:22.940
to pay this stupid dry-cleaning bill?

03:23.006 --> 03:24.632
I wanna help you out.

03:24.698 --> 03:27.153
But I can't just give you cash
every time you're in a bind.

03:27.219 --> 03:29.210
I got this hot morphine
connect down at St. Anfernee's.

03:29.277 --> 03:31.300
She said about some haunty
stuff going on down there.

03:31.367 --> 03:33.192
Maybe, you should pay her a visit.

03:36.111 --> 03:37.970
WOMAN: Thank you so much again for coming.

03:38.037 --> 03:39.595
Roofie spoke very highly of you.

03:39.860 --> 03:43.378
Well, he was very high when
he spoke of you too so...

03:43.444 --> 03:45.036
What's going on here?

03:45.104 --> 03:46.530
Just a lot of weird stuff

03:46.794 --> 03:48.785
like unplugged heart machines turning on

03:48.852 --> 03:52.236
and saline drip bags just
depleting for no reason.

03:52.303 --> 03:55.288
Have there been any deaths
in this particular hospital?

03:55.355 --> 03:57.279
Yeah, it's a hospital.

03:57.345 --> 04:00.034
- There's tens of thousands of deaths.
- I see.

04:03.949 --> 04:05.706
Oh, this is gonna be a
lot harder than I thought.

04:05.773 --> 04:08.361
Just to be clear, we
don't need you to exorcise

04:08.428 --> 04:09.988
the whole hospital. It's just one room.

04:10.053 --> 04:11.745
Just that?

04:11.811 --> 04:15.196
Yeah, it's the unofficial
hook-up room for the staff.

04:15.263 --> 04:18.646
So the nurses are willing
to pay whatever it takes.

04:18.713 --> 04:20.272
They are? That's great news.

04:20.339 --> 04:23.789
I'm so strapped for cash...

04:23.856 --> 04:26.079
I'm so strapped for time.

04:26.144 --> 04:27.273
Ain't no time for this.

04:27.339 --> 04:29.230
Honestly, you know. I'm in high demand.

04:29.296 --> 04:33.270
Job of this size, I would
have to charge about $100.

04:33.610 --> 04:34.638
A hundred dollars?

04:34.705 --> 04:36.663
- Okay, 50.
- Fifty?

04:36.728 --> 04:38.255
Twenty-five dollars, but not a penny more.

04:38.520 --> 04:40.809
- Great, deal.
- Deal.

04:40.876 --> 04:43.961
Good, I shan't let ye down, my lady.

04:44.028 --> 04:46.451
- Thank you.
- You are in good hands.

04:51.062 --> 04:52.853
Someone will clean that up, right?

05:09.575 --> 05:11.566
Excuse me, I was eating those.

05:11.633 --> 05:12.992
Not quickly enough, if you ask me.

05:13.059 --> 05:15.316
Oh, and who are you supposed to be?

05:15.382 --> 05:16.577
You see me?

05:16.642 --> 05:18.434
Is that your first or your last name?

05:18.501 --> 05:19.728
- What?
- What?

05:19.794 --> 05:21.918
No, I am Hiro Tamagachi.

05:21.984 --> 05:23.909
The professional hot dog eater?

05:23.975 --> 05:25.004
You died?

05:25.269 --> 05:26.264
Sadly, yes.

05:26.330 --> 05:27.592
My name is Kevin Pacalioglu

05:27.658 --> 05:29.316
and I'm here to finish

05:29.383 --> 05:30.777
any unfinished business you might have.

05:30.843 --> 05:32.403
Really? You do that for me?

05:32.468 --> 05:34.791
Yeah, for 25 bucks I'd
do just about anything..

05:34.858 --> 05:36.417
Well, right before I died,

05:36.484 --> 05:37.909
I was training for the most important

05:38.143 --> 05:39.535
eating competition of my life.

05:39.602 --> 05:41.361
BOTH: The Oinky's Hot Dog Invitational.

05:41.427 --> 05:42.588
- Exactly.
- I'm aware of it.

05:42.655 --> 05:44.214
I was all set to take back my title

05:44.281 --> 05:46.802
from my arch rival,
Johnny Praline, that prick.

05:46.868 --> 05:51.447
Well, I don't mean to sauer
your kraut, but you're a ghost.

05:51.514 --> 05:54.299
- Eating is kind of off the table.
- Here's the thing.

05:54.366 --> 05:56.556
A few years back, I signed
up to be an organ donor.

05:56.623 --> 06:00.073
And, after I died, they took
from me my most prized organ.

06:02.098 --> 06:04.088
Those bastards took your stomach.

06:04.154 --> 06:06.045
What? No, that's the good part, you idiot.

06:06.112 --> 06:07.273
What I'm trying to say is,

06:07.340 --> 06:10.624
I may be dead, but my stomach lives on.

06:10.691 --> 06:13.544
Find it, Kevin. Find
whoever has my stomach.

06:13.610 --> 06:16.098
And make them enter that
hot dog-eating contest.

06:24.991 --> 06:26.948
KEVIN: Hey, did the nurse
text you the address yet?

06:27.014 --> 06:28.407
No, man.

06:28.474 --> 06:30.067
Look, I'm gonna tell you when she text me.

06:30.134 --> 06:31.393
Why'd you give her my number anyway?

06:31.460 --> 06:33.086
Because she needs to get permission

06:33.153 --> 06:34.413
from Tomagachi's stomach recipient

06:34.480 --> 06:35.973
to set up a meeting.

06:36.039 --> 06:37.996
I'm saying, why did you
give the nurse my number?

06:38.063 --> 06:40.352
I don't have a number anymore.

06:40.418 --> 06:42.343
They shut off my cell phone weeks ago.

06:42.409 --> 06:44.333
Yeah, I've been living
off the grid, untrack-able.

06:44.400 --> 06:46.092
I'm a free man.

06:46.158 --> 06:47.453
It's not by choice.

06:47.519 --> 06:49.841
Excuse me, hey, bro,
it'd be good right here.

06:49.907 --> 06:52.362
All right, let's be cool here,
this client buys a lot of weed.

06:59.762 --> 07:01.885
Yo.

07:01.952 --> 07:04.042
- Yeah, you know, I'm like eyes in the sky.
- I hate that.

07:04.108 --> 07:05.236
- Don't you hate that?
- Yeah.

07:05.302 --> 07:06.397
Right?

07:11.673 --> 07:13.299
What is that?

07:13.365 --> 07:17.778
I call that one Spurious
Accusations and Lies.

07:17.844 --> 07:20.930
I would have called it Tiny Tower of Teeth.

07:20.996 --> 07:22.854
Or The Leaning Tower of Teeth-a.

07:24.613 --> 07:26.238
So what were you, like,
a dentist or something?

07:26.304 --> 07:29.655
I was an avant-garde-ist.

07:29.721 --> 07:31.546
And I put myself, literally,

07:31.613 --> 07:34.002
into every piece of work I ever made.

07:34.068 --> 07:37.982
Blood, sweat, jism diluted
with tears of happiness.

07:38.050 --> 07:39.675
That's jiz?

07:39.742 --> 07:41.733
That one's a mixed-media collage

07:41.799 --> 07:44.950
of pubic hair glued together
with pus from a sex wound.

07:45.017 --> 07:47.638
And that there, my masterpiece.

07:47.705 --> 07:48.767
For my swan song,

07:48.832 --> 07:50.956
I hung myself upside-down

07:51.022 --> 07:53.478
and exploded myself on a blank canvas.

07:53.543 --> 07:57.061
But those imbeciles
have hung it upside-down.

07:57.127 --> 07:58.653
ROOFIE: Yo.

07:58.720 --> 08:01.640
- The nurse texted me the address.
- Oh, good.

08:01.706 --> 08:03.332
Guess who's gonna be here Saturday night.

08:03.398 --> 08:04.626
James McAvoy?

08:04.692 --> 08:05.887
- I don't know.
- Who?

08:05.954 --> 08:08.009
No. Camomile White.

08:08.077 --> 08:09.735
Yes, she's doing, like, a séance.

08:09.801 --> 08:11.593
Channeling the spirit of Vesuvius,

08:11.660 --> 08:13.286
whatever his name is.

08:13.352 --> 08:15.741
The guy who did all this
pretentious ass-nice art.

08:15.807 --> 08:17.002
Vesuvius.

08:17.267 --> 08:18.926
You should go meet her.

08:18.992 --> 08:21.348
You know what, I think that ship has sank.

08:21.413 --> 08:23.404
I went to that book signing thing.

08:23.471 --> 08:25.263
And she can't see ghosts at all.

08:25.329 --> 08:27.221
- She's a total fake.
- What?

08:27.286 --> 08:28.647
- Yeah.
- Fake?

08:28.714 --> 08:29.215
Yeah.

08:29.239 --> 08:31.168
Hey, man, just hope her titties isn't fake.

08:31.169 --> 08:32.628
No, I don't know.

08:32.693 --> 08:35.383
Hard to tell when I was
throwing up all over them.

08:35.448 --> 08:37.539
I wrecked her Soixante pantsuit.

08:37.605 --> 08:41.155
Now she's sticking me with
this $25 dry-cleaning bill.

08:41.222 --> 08:42.780
- That's the bill you told me about?
- Yeah.

08:42.847 --> 08:44.805
- That's the bill? Twenty-five dollars?
- Yeah.

08:44.872 --> 08:48.255
Come on, man, Camomile White
don't need your $25, she's rich.

08:48.322 --> 08:49.683
She's power-moving you, man.

08:49.748 --> 08:51.341
- She's what?
- Power-playing.

08:51.407 --> 08:53.265
She's trying to assert
her dominance, that's all.

08:53.332 --> 08:55.322
- I don't like it when people do that.
- Yeah.

08:55.389 --> 08:56.715
Power-play me.

08:56.783 --> 08:58.309
You know what?

08:58.375 --> 09:00.267
She try to muscle me
with a dry-cleaning bill?

09:00.332 --> 09:02.721
Wait until she sees
what my counter-move is.

09:02.987 --> 09:04.977
And what move would that be?

09:05.045 --> 09:07.963
It's the least expected move there is.

09:08.030 --> 09:09.159
I'm gonna pay that bill.

09:09.225 --> 09:10.320
On time.

09:10.386 --> 09:12.077
In full.

09:12.144 --> 09:15.097
Now, if you'll excuse me, I
have a stomach to track down.

09:28.999 --> 09:30.160
I'm here about the stomach.

09:30.227 --> 09:32.052
- You're the guy.
- Yeah, I'm the guy.

09:32.118 --> 09:34.838
Menachem. Sit down, sit down.

09:34.905 --> 09:36.795
I didn't know what kind
of bagel you'd want.

09:36.862 --> 09:38.256
So I didn't get you any.

09:38.322 --> 09:40.347
Oh, can I settle on this?
Don't touch these bagels.

09:40.412 --> 09:41.839
Oh, since we're just sitting here,

09:41.905 --> 09:44.062
why don't I tell you a story?

09:44.128 --> 09:45.953
Every ghost needs closure

09:46.019 --> 09:47.513
and that's the whole
reason he's still here.

09:47.778 --> 09:49.005
It's an amazing story.

09:49.072 --> 09:50.897
And it definitely explains this appetite.

09:50.963 --> 09:53.418
I didn't even know you could
receive stomach transplants.

09:53.484 --> 09:56.903
Listen to me, I'm very
appreciative of this stomach.

09:56.968 --> 10:00.154
But this Oinky's hot
dog eating competition,

10:00.220 --> 10:01.381
that I can't do.

10:01.448 --> 10:02.675
Oh, you don't have to do it though.

10:02.742 --> 10:04.766
It's not even you. It's
Tamagachi's stomach.

10:04.831 --> 10:06.856
It's very well-trained, it
will do all the work for you.

10:06.921 --> 10:09.145
You don't get it. I can't...

10:09.212 --> 10:11.998
- Oinky's hot dogs, they're pork hot dogs.
- Yeah.

10:12.064 --> 10:13.027
I can't eat pork.

10:13.093 --> 10:14.353
What happens if you eat it?

10:14.619 --> 10:16.743
It's against my religion.
We don't eat pork.

10:16.810 --> 10:19.032
It's like breaking a contract with God.

10:19.098 --> 10:20.193
Who negotiated that?

10:20.260 --> 10:21.654
I'm not doing your competition

10:21.720 --> 10:23.643
and that's that, I'm sorry.

10:23.711 --> 10:25.933
No, no, no, you can do it.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.691
You can do it.

10:33.664 --> 10:35.057
HIRO: He said no?

10:35.124 --> 10:37.047
After I saved his life
by donating my stomach?

10:37.114 --> 10:40.067
- I know, Hiro Tamagachi, I know.
- I have an idea.

10:40.133 --> 10:41.858
If you don't get that goddamn rabbi

10:41.925 --> 10:43.585
into that hot dog-eating contest,

10:43.651 --> 10:45.874
I'm gonna unplug every
feeding tube in this hospital.

10:45.940 --> 10:47.731
But that would mean...?

10:47.798 --> 10:48.992
Hundreds of innocent lives lost.

10:49.059 --> 10:50.386
All on your conscience.

10:50.451 --> 10:52.742
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that's bad.

10:52.808 --> 10:54.036
Why, what were you gonna say?

10:54.102 --> 10:56.026
No, nothing, I was just thinking that,

10:56.093 --> 10:57.984
if the hauntings got
worse, I wouldn't get paid

10:58.050 --> 11:00.472
and I wouldn't be able to
afford my dry-cleaning bill

11:00.539 --> 11:02.065
and Camomile would
basically win, but that...

11:02.331 --> 11:04.785
You know what, your thing is
probably a way bigger deal.

11:04.852 --> 11:06.544
Figure it out.

11:08.998 --> 11:11.389
SIMMONS: What was that?
We had him on grand theft.

11:11.455 --> 11:14.474
DETECTIVE 2: One bottle of
liquor. The rest was baby formula.

11:14.541 --> 11:16.464
So what are you saying?
Perp was a family man?

11:16.531 --> 11:17.924
Trying to provide?

11:17.991 --> 11:19.582
What I'm saying, Simmons, is sometimes,

11:19.650 --> 11:22.303
if no one gets hurt,

11:22.370 --> 11:25.224
and the motive is noble enough, sometimes,

11:27.844 --> 11:30.201
it just ain't worth the paperwork.

12:03.313 --> 12:05.304
- What are you doing here?
- I think I found the loophole.

12:05.369 --> 12:06.729
Are those Funyuns?

12:06.995 --> 12:07.990
Get out of here.

12:08.057 --> 12:09.151
- Give me one.
- No.

12:09.218 --> 12:10.579
All right, listen, listen, listen.

12:10.645 --> 12:12.204
In the criminal justice system,

12:12.271 --> 12:14.261
there are felonies and
there are misdemeanors.

12:14.327 --> 12:16.352
In Jewish, there has to be some sins

12:16.417 --> 12:17.578
- that are worse than others, right?
- In Jewish.

12:17.646 --> 12:19.271
According to Yohakmet,

12:19.338 --> 12:21.063
this analogy you came up with,

12:21.130 --> 12:23.451
eating pork breaks the laws of kosher.

12:23.518 --> 12:25.974
- That's a felony.
- Okay, all right.

12:26.040 --> 12:29.159
But sometimes, if nobody gets hurt

12:29.225 --> 12:30.386
and the motive is noble enough,

12:30.453 --> 12:32.145
it just ain't worth the paperwork.

12:32.211 --> 12:33.903
What are you talking about?

12:33.969 --> 12:37.021
I'm talking about eating
pork is a victimless sin.

12:37.088 --> 12:39.178
The only person you're
worried about offending is God.

12:39.245 --> 12:40.771
By eating these hot dogs,

12:40.837 --> 12:42.098
you will be directly helping

12:42.164 --> 12:44.056
a tortured ghost finally find his peace.

12:44.122 --> 12:46.777
The ghost of the man who saved your life,

12:46.843 --> 12:49.264
I mean, come on, God's gotta understand.

12:51.056 --> 12:52.816
All right?

12:52.881 --> 12:54.374
For me?

12:55.038 --> 12:56.895
Oh, man.

12:59.683 --> 13:01.009
KEVIN: If you can eat this,

13:01.076 --> 13:03.000
you'll have no problem eating a hot dog.

13:03.067 --> 13:05.755
Well, then, why don't we
just start with a hot dog?

13:05.820 --> 13:07.679
Okay.

13:09.072 --> 13:10.200
Hotdog.

13:10.267 --> 13:12.191
I wanna do this, I really do.

13:12.258 --> 13:14.348
But this could be a slippery slope.

13:14.614 --> 13:15.575
How so?

13:15.642 --> 13:17.565
I've kept Kosher my entire life

13:17.632 --> 13:20.685
and cultivated a sense of
discipline and self-control.

13:20.750 --> 13:23.937
If I break this one rule,
albeit for a noble cause,

13:24.003 --> 13:26.060
who's to say I won't spiral out of control?

13:26.127 --> 13:27.685
It won't happen.

13:27.752 --> 13:30.008
I'm here with you every
step of the way, okay?

13:30.074 --> 13:34.089
Just think of me as a
moral compass of sorts.

13:41.521 --> 13:43.179
Here it comes.

13:47.426 --> 13:48.555
There's the rush.

13:52.868 --> 13:54.593
Yeah, okay.

13:56.617 --> 13:58.078
Fair enough, yeah, I deserve that.

14:03.386 --> 14:06.902
♪ Meshugenah ♪

14:06.969 --> 14:10.619
♪ Meshugenah ♪

14:10.685 --> 14:13.936
♪ Meshugenah ♪

14:14.003 --> 14:17.685

14:37.095 --> 14:38.654
- Coming, buddy?
- What?

14:38.721 --> 14:39.749
Hey, what are you doing here?

14:39.816 --> 14:41.309
I know you've got some drugs.

14:41.374 --> 14:42.735
Come on.

14:45.422 --> 14:46.817
Stop, stop.

14:47.081 --> 14:49.205
What are we doing? Look at us.

14:49.272 --> 14:51.660
We're beating a man because he
didn't have heroin to give us.

14:51.727 --> 14:53.386
What happened?

14:53.452 --> 14:55.376
This is that slippery slope
I was telling you about.

14:55.443 --> 14:57.136
You were supposed to be my moral compass.

14:57.201 --> 14:58.628
You're a moron compass.

14:58.694 --> 15:00.486
- Let's get out of here.
- Out of here.

15:04.004 --> 15:05.896
KEVIN: You know what I
always want about hot dogs?

15:05.962 --> 15:08.648
It's the texture, it's like meat
has already been chewed for you.

15:08.715 --> 15:10.473
You don't have to do any of the work.

15:10.540 --> 15:11.966
- Hey, where the hell's our guy?
- Relax.

15:12.033 --> 15:13.459
He didn't wanna get recognized,

15:13.526 --> 15:15.816
so I lent him some clothes to change into.

15:15.881 --> 15:17.408
An orthodox Jew in your dingy clothes?

15:17.475 --> 15:18.835
He's gonna look like

15:19.830 --> 15:21.489
every other hipster in Brooklyn.

15:21.556 --> 15:23.779
All right. I'm gonna go see what

15:23.844 --> 15:25.570
that dick-licker Johnny Praline is up to.

15:26.831 --> 15:28.987
Hey.

15:29.054 --> 15:32.405
- Unrecognizable.
- You look very fetching.

15:32.471 --> 15:33.865
- I think so too.
- Yeah.

15:33.932 --> 15:36.419
So, hey, listen, I signed
you up under a pseudonym,

15:36.486 --> 15:38.444
- just to be safe. Yeah.
- Very smart.

15:38.509 --> 15:39.936
- Then, what'd you use?
- JOHNNY: Excuse me.

15:40.002 --> 15:41.562
You the one they call Anal Bead?

15:42.889 --> 15:44.216
- You're a putz.
- Shoot, no.

15:44.283 --> 15:46.472
It was supposed to say Animal Beard.

15:46.539 --> 15:48.696
My penmanship's a little tight.

15:48.762 --> 15:50.753
I'm Johnny Praline, defending champion.

15:50.818 --> 15:52.677
All right.

15:52.744 --> 15:55.496
Anyway, I just wanted to
pop by and introduce myself.

15:55.563 --> 15:56.825
Good luck. It's anyone's game.

15:56.890 --> 15:58.682
I'll catch you on the
flip-flop. Good enough.

15:58.749 --> 16:00.506
All right, see you later.

16:00.573 --> 16:01.901
- What a nice guy.
- A mensch.

16:02.166 --> 16:03.460
I didn't expect that in competition.

16:03.526 --> 16:05.318
Unbelievable, unbelievable.

16:05.384 --> 16:06.843
- Anyway, are you ready for this?
- Yeah.

16:07.109 --> 16:08.437
I had a lot of knishes on the way here.

16:08.503 --> 16:09.465
This shouldn't have been.

16:09.531 --> 16:10.626
That's all in the past now.

16:10.693 --> 16:12.385
Not really, but...

16:12.451 --> 16:13.778
You don't have to worry about it.

16:14.043 --> 16:15.471
You're stomach is gonna do all the work.

16:15.537 --> 16:16.533
I will be on the sidelines

16:16.598 --> 16:18.490
rooting for you the whole time.

16:18.556 --> 16:20.779
Let's go. I feel like Mr. Miyagi.

16:26.221 --> 16:29.106
ANNOUNCER: Well, the contestants
are taking their spots on the stage

16:29.173 --> 16:31.528
as the 32nd annual Oinky's
Hot Dog Invitational

16:31.595 --> 16:34.083
is about to get underway.

16:34.150 --> 16:36.274
Of course, defending his
title is Johnny Praline.

16:36.339 --> 16:39.060
And with the recent
passing of Hiro Tamagachi,

16:39.127 --> 16:41.217
I would say Praline is the frontrunner.

16:41.284 --> 16:44.237
Three, two, one, go!

16:44.900 --> 16:46.493
ANNOUNCER: And they're off.

16:50.341 --> 16:51.536
Praline's got his game face on.

16:51.602 --> 16:54.123
He has come out of the gate strong.

16:54.190 --> 16:56.446
Praline is using his
two-dogs-on-a-leash

16:56.512 --> 16:58.470
technique that won him gold last year.

16:58.536 --> 17:00.893
But it looks like newcomer Anal Bead

17:00.958 --> 17:02.849
is giving Praline a run for his money.

17:05.204 --> 17:06.864
It almost looks like Anal Bead

17:06.929 --> 17:09.053
is using the same
stomach-squeezing technique

17:09.121 --> 17:12.272
as the late, great Hiro Tamagachi.

17:20.102 --> 17:22.890
- And now, this competition...
- Wait a second.

17:22.955 --> 17:25.046
A man in the sidelines
is inhaling some hotdogs.

17:25.112 --> 17:26.671
He's pulling ahead of everyone.

17:27.898 --> 17:30.189
ANNOUNCER: It seems like
this competitor is adopting

17:30.255 --> 17:33.672
the fat-slob-shoveling-food
down-his-gullet technique.

17:33.739 --> 17:35.100
Now, I'm getting word that this guy

17:35.166 --> 17:37.686
has taken down three full
buckets of refill dogs.

17:37.753 --> 17:39.578
ANNOUNCER 2: That's about 60 hot dogs.

17:39.644 --> 17:40.872
ANNOUNCER: And if that's the case,

17:40.938 --> 17:43.062
this contest has just met its dark horse.

17:45.783 --> 17:47.972
ANNOUNCER 2: The immersions
of the spectator is thrilling.

17:48.039 --> 17:50.594
It's like when Seabiscuit
popped out of the crowd,

17:50.660 --> 17:52.651
won 1940 Santa Anita Handicap.

17:55.803 --> 17:57.163
(Alarm sounds)

17:57.229 --> 17:59.584
TIMER: All right, times up. Stop eating.

18:00.779 --> 18:02.438
We have a winner.

18:05.027 --> 18:06.916
- Winner!
- ANNOUNCER: There you have it.

18:06.983 --> 18:09.936
At 75 hot dogs, a complete unknown

18:10.003 --> 18:13.985
has won the Oinky's 32nd
Annual Hotdog Invitational.

18:20.387 --> 18:21.616
What happened?

18:21.682 --> 18:23.639
Why did you guys all stopped eating?

18:29.313 --> 18:30.673
- Hey, schmuck.
- Yeah?

18:30.739 --> 18:33.626
I renounced my most
sacred religious beliefs

18:33.692 --> 18:36.546
because you told me I was
helping the ghost of the man

18:36.612 --> 18:38.304
who saved my life find peace.

18:38.371 --> 18:40.959
It was an accident. I
binge eat when I'm nervous.

18:41.224 --> 18:43.447
- And then, you...!
- I know, I'm sorry.

18:43.514 --> 18:44.906
I screwed up. I screwed up.

18:44.973 --> 18:46.599
Menachem, I'm sorry.

18:46.666 --> 18:48.656
Menachem, Menachem.

18:48.722 --> 18:50.647
Menachem.

18:52.936 --> 18:55.756
- Tamagachi, what just happened?
- Are you serious?

18:55.823 --> 18:57.580
You won. You set a world record.

18:57.647 --> 18:59.107
I am so sorry.

18:59.174 --> 19:00.467
I don't want this.

19:00.534 --> 19:02.292
No, no, no, it's okay.

19:02.359 --> 19:04.748
Watching you eat was
like watching Michelangelo

19:04.813 --> 19:06.705
paint the Sistine Chapel.

19:06.771 --> 19:08.629
Besides, it was never
really about me winning.

19:08.696 --> 19:11.184
It was about that ass
clown Johnny Praline losing.

19:11.250 --> 19:14.037
You know, for the first time in my life,

19:14.104 --> 19:15.730
it is my heart that is full.

19:38.025 --> 19:39.386
ROOFIE: I'm proud of you, man.

19:39.452 --> 19:41.311
You got 25 bucks the old fashioned way.

19:41.377 --> 19:43.865
Miss Morphine gave you a glowing review.

19:43.932 --> 19:45.159
Sounds like good day to me.

19:45.225 --> 19:46.884
And, Roofie, I set a world record, man.

19:46.951 --> 19:49.472
I can't believe that.

19:49.539 --> 19:51.064
Oh, I took a 25 bucks

19:51.131 --> 19:52.491
and got that traveler's check.

19:52.557 --> 19:54.382
Good, give me, give me. I'm not sure why.

19:54.449 --> 19:55.876
It's part of my

19:55.942 --> 19:57.369
counter-power-play move with Camomile.

19:57.435 --> 19:59.392
Yeah. Are you sure that's the best move?

19:59.459 --> 20:01.085
Roofie, trust me.

20:01.151 --> 20:03.971
It's the only move I have left.

20:10.706 --> 20:11.867
Well, well, well.

20:11.934 --> 20:14.024
If it isn't the Vomitable Snowman.

20:14.091 --> 20:15.384
Enough with the pleasantries.

20:15.451 --> 20:18.006
I'm here for one thing and one thing only.

20:18.072 --> 20:19.831
If you're here for the
séance, you missed it.

20:19.897 --> 20:21.689
Oh, the séance? Yeah, how did that go?

20:21.756 --> 20:22.784
They loved me.

20:22.850 --> 20:24.707
James McAvoy even showed up.

20:24.774 --> 20:27.130
Wow, and the ghost, he was satisfied?

20:27.197 --> 20:30.613
The spirit of Vesuvius
was more than satisfied.

20:30.680 --> 20:33.666
No, no, no.

20:33.732 --> 20:36.255
Do you know up and down?

20:36.321 --> 20:38.643
He doesn't seem happy.

20:38.709 --> 20:40.667
What are you talking about?

20:40.733 --> 20:42.624
All he wanted was for his final piece

20:42.691 --> 20:45.610
to be hung right-side-up
by this imbeciles.

20:45.677 --> 20:47.169
He's an avant-garde-ist.

20:47.236 --> 20:48.630
He's missunders...

20:48.696 --> 20:50.853
- You know what, I de-gress.
- As always.

20:50.919 --> 20:54.104
I'm here to talk about
the dry-cleaning bill.

20:55.531 --> 20:57.654
- Check.
- A traveler's check?

20:57.720 --> 20:59.910
Yes, I'm in between banks right now,

20:59.976 --> 21:01.171
but I wanted to have a check

21:01.436 --> 21:03.129
so I could come here and say, check.

21:03.196 --> 21:05.617
As in, I'm onto you and your little game

21:05.683 --> 21:07.833
and I'm winning, I think.

21:07.900 --> 21:09.126
Like chess, right?

21:09.888 --> 21:11.115
No. What? No.

21:11.380 --> 21:13.037
Check mate.

21:13.104 --> 21:15.126
No. What beats check mate?

21:15.391 --> 21:17.380
What beats check mate? A flush?

21:18.473 --> 21:19.567
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

21:19.634 --> 21:20.661
Nothing.

21:22.749 --> 21:25.732
Why didn't I just say check mate?

21:39.754 --> 21:40.682
You wanna do this?

21:40.749 --> 21:41.709
Yes.

21:41.776 --> 21:43.566
- What's this?
- Go.

21:44.826 --> 21:46.350
My favorite masterpiece.

21:46.416 --> 21:48.439
Right side.

21:49.305 --> 21:55.425
