00:12.041 --> 00:13.583
Let me tell you a story.

00:14.291 --> 00:16.416
In 1977,

00:16.500 --> 00:19.000
in a small town in Wisconsin,

00:19.666 --> 00:22.750
a young couple learned
they were going to be parents.

00:23.666 --> 00:27.791
Their first child was a healthy baby boy
who they named Kyle.

00:28.791 --> 00:30.625
Soon after Kyle was born,

00:30.708 --> 00:33.166
the couple decided to have more children.

00:33.250 --> 00:36.208
And eventually, they were blessed.

00:37.500 --> 00:40.666
After they had their baby girl,
who they named Devon,

00:40.750 --> 00:42.958
they desperately wanted another baby.

00:43.541 --> 00:45.291
But unfortunately,

00:45.375 --> 00:48.791
the couple was told
having more children would be dangerous.

00:49.375 --> 00:51.250
So they had a decision to make.

00:58.875 --> 01:00.791
They would adopt a baby boy,

01:01.375 --> 01:03.833
one who would fit right in
with their son Kyle

01:03.916 --> 01:05.666
and their daughter Devon.

01:05.750 --> 01:09.000
But again, things didn't go as planned.

01:09.958 --> 01:11.791
I'm sorry to have to inform you,

01:11.875 --> 01:15.000
but the baby you were hoping for
is no longer available for adoption.

01:19.958 --> 01:23.625
But there is a second choice.

01:24.333 --> 01:28.083
He's a few days old and his name is Colin.

01:29.333 --> 01:30.625
We'll take him.

01:30.708 --> 01:33.708
I share this story
so you can understand this.

01:34.458 --> 01:38.916
Since the day I was born,
I've never been anybody's first choice.

01:48.458 --> 01:49.875
Let's go, let's go!

01:49.958 --> 01:51.583
Great job, great job!

01:52.916 --> 01:56.000
That's the kind of effort
we need in the playoffs. Way to go.

01:56.666 --> 01:58.208
You know I got you, Coach.

01:59.250 --> 02:02.125
Colin, can we get
a couple of quick questions?

02:02.833 --> 02:05.166
Uh... Yeah, sure.

02:05.250 --> 02:07.166
Congratulations on the win.

02:07.250 --> 02:09.000
Now, let's talk about your future.

02:09.083 --> 02:12.541
You had countless scholarship offers
to play college baseball

02:12.625 --> 02:15.458
and we know that at least
several of the major league teams

02:15.541 --> 02:17.458
are considering drafting you next June.

02:17.541 --> 02:20.875
But you've made it known
you wanna play college football.

02:20.958 --> 02:24.916
How does a three-sport star
with a 4.0 GPA,

02:25.000 --> 02:27.916
who also happened to be
league MVP quarterback,

02:28.000 --> 02:30.458
not have any offers to play football yet?

02:31.416 --> 02:32.583
Um...

02:32.666 --> 02:36.416
Honestly, that's not
where my focus is right now, you know?

02:36.500 --> 02:38.875
We got playoffs coming up soon.

02:38.958 --> 02:42.166
And we're trying to win a championship.
Isn't that right? Let's go!

02:43.375 --> 02:45.458
That's where my focus is right now.

02:47.666 --> 02:49.875
You handled that well, kid.

02:49.958 --> 02:53.083
-Thanks, Dad.
-You didn't tell them about Wisconsin?

02:53.166 --> 02:55.666
Why didn't you tell them
about the Wisconsin offer?

02:55.750 --> 02:57.541
Because it's not an offer.

02:58.291 --> 02:59.833
Is there anything to eat?

03:00.333 --> 03:02.833
There's leftover tater tot hot dish.

03:02.916 --> 03:05.333
No, there's not.

03:06.291 --> 03:07.666
Come on, Dad.

03:07.750 --> 03:09.583
There might be some leftover spaghetti.

03:12.250 --> 03:14.791
You should have told them
about the other offer.

03:14.875 --> 03:18.500
Other schools hear that
and they get interested.

03:18.583 --> 03:20.375
It's not an offer, Mom.

03:20.458 --> 03:21.708
Might as well be.

03:21.791 --> 03:23.750
You're gonna end up there. I can feel it.

03:23.833 --> 03:27.041
You'll be surrounded by line dancing
and cowboy boots.

03:27.125 --> 03:30.750
Okay.
So the same thing as Turlock, then.

03:30.833 --> 03:32.833
-Turlock with better cheese.

03:32.916 --> 03:34.250
I can handle that.

03:34.833 --> 03:37.000
-Hello.
-Hey, it's Coach Alvarez.

03:37.083 --> 03:39.166
Hey, Coach.
We were just talking about you.

03:39.250 --> 03:42.416
-I'd love to talk to Colin for a minute.
-Yeah. Hold on.

03:44.625 --> 03:46.250
I'll take it up in my room!

03:47.500 --> 03:49.625
-He'll be right with you.
-All right.

03:54.333 --> 03:55.875
Thanks, Dad. I got it.

03:57.750 --> 03:59.041
Hey, Coach.

03:59.125 --> 04:00.375
How's it going?

04:00.458 --> 04:02.125
This moment right here?

04:02.208 --> 04:05.125
This is one
of the happiest moments of my life.

04:05.625 --> 04:07.083
But let me back up.

04:07.166 --> 04:09.958
Before I could get
an offer to play college football,

04:10.041 --> 04:14.458
first I had to get noticed by coaches
at a high school combine.

04:49.500 --> 04:51.041
Set, go!

04:55.375 --> 04:56.875
See that throwing motion?

04:57.583 --> 04:59.541
Is he a quarterback or a pitcher?

05:03.375 --> 05:04.958
Getting it where it needs to be.

05:05.041 --> 05:07.416
With no 300 pound monsters
breathing down his neck,

05:07.500 --> 05:09.416
he's getting it where it needs to be.

05:09.500 --> 05:12.333
Combine numbers look good.
Quick. Athletic.

05:12.416 --> 05:14.250
Set, go!

05:14.833 --> 05:17.375
Maybe convert him to a wideout, DB?

05:17.458 --> 05:20.250
I'm not saying he doesn't look good.
He looks great.

05:21.041 --> 05:23.083
But they'll break him in half
in the Big Ten.

05:23.166 --> 05:24.333
Set, go!

05:27.916 --> 05:29.416
What do you think, Coach?

05:32.375 --> 05:34.041
Might be something to work with.

05:36.125 --> 05:38.708
Another way I could get noticed by schools

05:38.791 --> 05:41.583
would be at one
of their summer football camps.

05:42.083 --> 05:44.125
-Fluid.
-Here, here, you open it.

05:46.333 --> 05:47.291
Okay.

05:53.166 --> 05:54.541
"Dear Colin Kaepernick,

05:54.625 --> 05:58.666
We were all impressed
with your level of athleticism.

05:58.750 --> 06:01.791
You'd be a great quarterback one day.
We would like to invite you

06:01.875 --> 06:04.291
-to our summer football camp."
-Great news!

06:04.375 --> 06:06.041
Congratulations, honey.

06:06.125 --> 06:08.166
Hey, that looks like
a lot of camp invites.

06:08.250 --> 06:10.583
-I know.
-Looks like word's getting out.

06:11.208 --> 06:13.666
All I need is a chance
to show them what I can do.

06:13.750 --> 06:14.958
I got it from there.

06:15.041 --> 06:18.291
-Which schools do you wanna go to?
-All of them.

06:18.375 --> 06:20.041
Sounds like a road trip.

06:20.125 --> 06:23.625
Come on, let's not call it a road trip.
Let's call it a business trip.

06:23.708 --> 06:26.000
-What? Mom.
-You got food on your face.

06:26.625 --> 06:29.000
Come here. Give me a hug.

06:29.083 --> 06:30.500
I'm proud of you.

06:30.583 --> 06:32.875
I know. Thank you.

06:32.958 --> 06:34.541
So that's what I did.

06:35.458 --> 06:36.625
Set, go!

06:36.708 --> 06:40.625
I went to every camp I could
within driving distance of Turlock.

06:40.708 --> 06:42.833
And I could show them what I could do.

06:42.916 --> 06:45.250
I've never worked this hard in my life.

06:46.041 --> 06:47.458
But the hardest part?

06:48.708 --> 06:52.208
Waiting to hear if any of the schools
were interested in me.

06:55.250 --> 06:56.583
Just gonna call Mom.

06:57.291 --> 07:00.000
She said she'd call if there was news.

07:00.583 --> 07:01.750
Just a quick check.

07:02.708 --> 07:04.375
All right. Don't talk too long.

07:04.458 --> 07:06.250
Those roaming fees ain't cheap.

07:17.791 --> 07:18.625
Hello?

07:18.708 --> 07:20.041
-Hey.
-Hey.

07:20.125 --> 07:21.041
Anything?

07:21.750 --> 07:22.875
Nothing yet.

07:23.791 --> 07:25.083
Where to next?

07:26.541 --> 07:27.916
-Nevada.
-Ah.

07:28.750 --> 07:29.916
Are you tired?

07:31.208 --> 07:32.500
I'm fine.

07:32.583 --> 07:34.500
Dad's running on fumes, though.

07:34.583 --> 07:35.875
I'm fine!

07:37.583 --> 07:38.625
I miss you.

07:38.708 --> 07:40.375
Miss you too, Mom.

07:40.458 --> 07:42.625
We'll be back home after Nevada.

07:42.708 --> 07:45.208
Are you sure we haven't gotten
anything yet?

07:45.291 --> 07:48.291
I thought for sure we would've heard back
from some schools by now.

07:50.958 --> 07:52.375
You can't control that.

07:52.458 --> 07:54.666
All you can do is get out there

07:54.750 --> 07:59.041
and be the best that you can be, honey.

07:59.125 --> 07:59.958
Mom.

08:00.666 --> 08:01.500
Hmm?

08:02.625 --> 08:04.625
How many rejections did I get?

08:08.375 --> 08:09.541
Just a couple.

08:10.166 --> 08:11.541
From who?

08:11.625 --> 08:13.458
Actually, it doesn't matter.

08:14.708 --> 08:16.458
Was Stanford one of them?

08:17.541 --> 08:18.375
Yes.

08:21.333 --> 08:22.416
Okay.

08:22.500 --> 08:24.000
Okay, it doesn't matter.

08:24.583 --> 08:26.083
Chin up, Colin.

08:27.041 --> 08:28.791
Okay. I'll talk to you later. Bye.

08:35.458 --> 08:36.708
On to the next.

08:39.208 --> 08:41.000
-Set, go!

08:48.750 --> 08:50.500
What the fuck was that?

08:50.583 --> 08:53.250
That was some ugly shit,
that's what that was.

08:53.333 --> 08:57.625
First time I've ever felt bad for the pig
that died to become a football.

08:58.666 --> 09:00.416
Just plain ugly.

09:00.500 --> 09:03.166
Your daddy should've just kept you
in his ball sack

09:03.250 --> 09:05.583
if this is what you're gonna
contribute to football.

09:06.416 --> 09:07.625
Run it again.

09:12.416 --> 09:13.875
Set, go!

09:22.125 --> 09:24.250
-There it is.
-All right, all right!

09:25.916 --> 09:26.875
Next!

09:30.375 --> 09:32.583
That coach has a mouth on him, huh?

09:34.208 --> 09:35.458
I think he likes you.

09:40.666 --> 09:41.833
Maybe I'll just...

09:42.625 --> 09:43.458
give up.

09:44.583 --> 09:46.708
Work with you at the cheese factory.

09:49.333 --> 09:51.583
It's gotta be easier than all of this.

09:55.750 --> 09:58.083
What do you call a cheese that's sad?

09:58.166 --> 10:00.250
-Come on.
-Blue cheese.

10:00.333 --> 10:01.916
You've told me this one before.

10:02.916 --> 10:05.541
When do you got
to be careful around cheese?

10:05.625 --> 10:06.708
Please don't.

10:06.791 --> 10:08.541
When it's up to no Gouda.

10:09.958 --> 10:10.958
Just stop.

10:11.541 --> 10:12.708
Okay, Colin.

10:13.916 --> 10:15.208
Don't get excited.

10:17.125 --> 10:18.750
Curd your enthusiasm.

10:35.416 --> 10:36.250
Hey.

10:36.333 --> 10:37.708
Coach Parker called.

10:37.791 --> 10:39.958
They're having informal workouts tomorrow.

10:40.458 --> 10:41.833
I don't care.

10:42.666 --> 10:48.125
And someone
from the University of California called.

10:48.208 --> 10:51.500
They wanted to schedule a visit
for you to try out.

10:53.208 --> 10:54.125
What?

10:57.500 --> 10:59.125
Bro, I'm telling you,

10:59.625 --> 11:01.750
if I never get in the car again...

11:03.625 --> 11:05.250
But how did it go?

11:05.333 --> 11:06.916
How many offers did you get?

11:07.541 --> 11:09.750
Uh, I'm just waiting to hear back.

11:10.750 --> 11:13.458
I just gotta crush
this Cal tryout next week.

11:13.541 --> 11:15.833
You thinking about taking
any baseball scholarships

11:15.916 --> 11:18.125
if you don't get any football offers
by November?

11:20.208 --> 11:21.625
Set, go!

11:26.708 --> 11:27.708
Yes.

11:28.666 --> 11:29.875
Nice toss!

11:29.958 --> 11:31.958
Stay there. I'll be right back.

11:33.291 --> 11:34.125
Coach.

11:38.500 --> 11:41.125
You gotta see this kid.
I think he's our guy.

11:41.208 --> 11:43.416
Yeah, but Riley committed.

11:44.208 --> 11:45.416
What?

11:45.500 --> 11:47.458
Kevin Riley. He committed last night.

11:47.541 --> 11:50.666
Yeah, I know who Riley-- That's-- Wow.

11:50.750 --> 11:52.583
I mean, that's a good get.

11:52.666 --> 11:54.291
What should I tell him?

11:55.916 --> 11:58.458
Never mind. I'll take care of it.

12:00.416 --> 12:03.166
At some point,
you get so used to rejection,

12:03.250 --> 12:05.500
you can see it coming a mile away.

12:06.375 --> 12:09.166
It was like no one
would just give me a shot

12:09.250 --> 12:11.250
to show them how good I could be.

12:14.541 --> 12:16.291
And it didn't feel fair.

12:25.458 --> 12:26.291
Hey.

12:27.541 --> 12:28.875
Cal sucks anyway.

12:30.083 --> 12:33.041
You telling me I can't even play
for a team that sucks?

12:33.666 --> 12:34.750
Apparently.

12:35.500 --> 12:37.625
But I'm also saying don't worry about it.

12:37.708 --> 12:41.375
You got your whole senior season
to show the world you're a quarterback.

12:41.458 --> 12:42.625
So show them.

12:44.291 --> 12:45.791
Good morning.

12:47.083 --> 12:48.541
Welcome back to school.

12:48.625 --> 12:50.833
And welcome to AP Calculus.

12:53.000 --> 12:53.958
Watch this.

12:56.791 --> 12:58.041
This again.

12:59.708 --> 13:01.166
Just shut up and listen.

13:03.208 --> 13:04.583
You have a gift.

13:05.916 --> 13:08.750
Your gift is a multi-million dollar arm.

13:09.833 --> 13:13.875
And every school in the country
wants that arm to pitch for them.

13:17.541 --> 13:18.458
Imagine this.

13:18.541 --> 13:22.833
It's November, baseball signing day,
and you have no offers for football.

13:22.916 --> 13:24.375
That's not gonna happen.

13:25.416 --> 13:26.583
It's signing day.

13:27.916 --> 13:30.583
Your classmates and some of your teammates
are on stage

13:30.666 --> 13:33.333
talking about what colleges
they're going to.

13:34.041 --> 13:38.416
All while you, the best athlete
this town has ever produced,

13:38.500 --> 13:40.166
just sits by and watches.

13:40.250 --> 13:41.666
Is that what you want?

13:42.166 --> 13:44.500
You wanna be somebody's second choice?

13:46.500 --> 13:48.666
No. That's not what I want, Coach.

13:50.750 --> 13:53.916
What I want is to be a quarterback.

13:56.083 --> 13:59.625
I don't know what to say to you.

14:02.375 --> 14:03.833
Every night, I pray...

14:06.500 --> 14:09.083
"Please let this kid come to his senses."

14:09.166 --> 14:11.958
But apparently that prayer
falls on deaf ears.

14:12.041 --> 14:15.583
Coach, I truly appreciate
everything you've done for me.

14:15.666 --> 14:16.791
I mean it.

14:21.416 --> 14:23.500
Let me give you some advice, Kaepernick.

14:23.583 --> 14:24.416
Don't wait.

14:25.833 --> 14:29.791
Nobody who truly wanted anything
waited for it. Just make it happen.

14:32.500 --> 14:33.708
Yes, Coach.

14:35.166 --> 14:36.083
He's right.

14:37.083 --> 14:41.416
It's one thing seeing you in camps, Colin,
but they need to see you playing a game.

14:42.833 --> 14:46.250
You call your brother,
tell him to get over here right now.

14:46.333 --> 14:47.458
We got work to do.

14:53.166 --> 14:54.000
Coach.

14:55.583 --> 14:57.500
Thank you so much, sir.

14:58.416 --> 14:59.291
Appreciate it.

15:29.750 --> 15:32.375
I'm gonna need postage
for all these, please.

15:32.458 --> 15:34.416
-How many?
-119.

15:34.500 --> 15:35.541
Oh.

15:37.250 --> 15:39.125
They'd be lucky to have you.

15:39.708 --> 15:42.541
And that brings us back to this moment.

15:44.791 --> 15:47.083
-Turlock with better cheese.

15:47.166 --> 15:48.333
I can handle it.

15:49.083 --> 15:51.458
-Hello.
-Hey, it's Coach Alvarez.

15:51.541 --> 15:53.458
Hey, Coach.
We were just talking about you.

15:53.541 --> 15:56.041
-I'd love to talk to Colin for a minute.
-Yeah, hold on.

15:56.125 --> 15:58.791
One of the happiest moments of my life.

16:00.333 --> 16:01.875
Thanks, Dad. I got it.

16:03.750 --> 16:05.750
Hey, Coach. How's it going?

16:05.833 --> 16:11.000
I went to almost two dozen camps,
clinics, combines, and showcases.

16:11.541 --> 16:14.791
Sent DVDs to every school in the country.

16:14.875 --> 16:18.541
And that summer,
every school in the country passed.

16:18.625 --> 16:20.291
Except for one.

16:20.375 --> 16:21.541
Wisconsin.

16:22.458 --> 16:24.333
They didn't pass until later.

16:33.333 --> 16:34.166
Thank you.

16:34.666 --> 16:35.750
Thank you, Coach.

16:37.541 --> 16:39.250
Thank you for considering me.

17:07.208 --> 17:10.291
Kick some ass in the playoffs.
Go win a title.

17:11.083 --> 17:12.250
They'll see you, Colin.

17:12.333 --> 17:13.666
They're gonna see you.

17:17.333 --> 17:19.666
Once again, the final score:

17:19.750 --> 17:23.291
West 27, Pitman 22.

17:24.916 --> 17:27.125
The playoffs continue for West,

17:27.208 --> 17:30.291
but we may have just witnessed
the last football game

17:30.375 --> 17:33.416
of Pitman quarterback
Colin Kaepernick's career.

17:34.583 --> 17:38.000
Not the way he wanted to end it,
but nevertheless,

17:38.083 --> 17:41.500
he'll go down as one of the best
Turlock has seen.

20:07.833 --> 20:08.958
How are you?

20:10.041 --> 20:11.666
I'll be all right.

20:28.708 --> 20:30.791
-You guys play Atwater Saturday?
-Yeah.

20:30.875 --> 20:33.750
Yeah, they got that tall dude
from Europe that plays for them.

20:34.500 --> 20:36.333
Every school is looking at him.

20:36.833 --> 20:39.333
You don't care, Jake.
You only like the cheerleaders.

20:39.416 --> 20:41.583
What's wrong with liking cheerleaders?

20:42.083 --> 20:44.750
You don't like cheerleaders?
Everyone likes cheerleaders.

20:44.833 --> 20:47.291
I know Colin likes cheerleaders, right?

20:50.666 --> 20:51.791
All right, man.

20:52.666 --> 20:53.625
Enough of this shit.

20:53.708 --> 20:57.166
-You've been in your feelings for weeks.
-Ever since football season ended.

20:57.250 --> 20:59.541
Honestly,
it's depressing just looking at you.

20:59.625 --> 21:00.666
Real talk.

21:01.250 --> 21:04.041
Look, man, you balled out,
you did all you could do.

21:04.125 --> 21:06.666
This all feeling sorry for yourself shit
has to stop.

21:06.750 --> 21:08.791
I'm not feeling sorry for myself.

21:08.875 --> 21:12.166
"I'm not feeling sorry for myself."
You sound like you're about to cry.

21:13.416 --> 21:14.333
Yeah, bro.

21:14.416 --> 21:17.750
And it's not like your life
is about to suck.

21:17.833 --> 21:20.708
You're gonna be a rich
Major League Baseball player.

21:20.791 --> 21:24.000
I know you don't think baseball
is cool and all, but you're wrong.

21:24.083 --> 21:27.708
I dare you to go look
at a 1992 Chipper Jones baseball card.

21:27.791 --> 21:30.500
Tell me that's not
the coolest looking dude in the world.

21:31.541 --> 21:32.958
For real. Look him up.

21:34.791 --> 21:36.166
Ever see Bull Durham?

21:37.250 --> 21:39.083
-No.
-Watch it.

21:39.625 --> 21:42.625
There are some fine groupies
in baseball. That's the minor leagues.

21:42.708 --> 21:45.166
Imagine what the Major League
groupies look like.

21:45.833 --> 21:49.208
All flawless like Lindsay Lohan
and Amanda Bynes.

21:51.291 --> 21:53.083
You better not smile.

21:59.666 --> 22:01.583
Give me one of those damn tacos.

22:01.666 --> 22:03.375
I was about to say. Take one.

22:37.291 --> 22:38.833
You have a game tomorrow.

22:41.125 --> 22:43.000
A gentle breeze gets you sick.

22:43.541 --> 22:45.666
You can be mad, but don't be stupid.

22:45.750 --> 22:46.875
I'm fine.

22:46.958 --> 22:48.583
And I'm a nurse.

22:49.500 --> 22:51.500
There's a flu going around, Colin.

22:51.583 --> 22:53.250
Trust me, you don't want it.

22:54.791 --> 22:57.583
All right. I'm just gonna be
a few more minutes.

23:00.583 --> 23:02.458
I know you feel like...

23:04.291 --> 23:06.000
all your hard work was for nothing.

23:08.125 --> 23:09.875
It will be if you let it.

23:16.000 --> 23:20.291
Put on a damn coat
or get your ass in the house.

23:29.500 --> 23:31.583
Damn, negro. What's wrong with you?

23:38.083 --> 23:39.000
I'm sick.

23:40.000 --> 23:41.458
Yeah, no shit.

24:00.541 --> 24:01.875
I tried to tell him.

25:05.041 --> 25:06.000
Yes!

25:16.416 --> 25:18.083
You wanted to see me, Coach?

25:18.583 --> 25:19.416
It's for you.

25:28.708 --> 25:30.333
Well? Where the fuck is he?

25:31.041 --> 25:32.083
Hello?

25:32.916 --> 25:34.666
Is this Kaepernick?

25:34.750 --> 25:36.416
Kaepernick, yeah.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.125
Yeah, this is Coach Ault,

25:39.208 --> 25:41.541
football coach at Nevada.

25:42.125 --> 25:46.416
Yeah, I heard maybe I don't need
to feel sorry for the pigs anymore.

25:46.500 --> 25:48.833
One of my guys saw your basketball game

25:48.916 --> 25:51.708
and thinks you'd be a good fit with us.

25:52.916 --> 25:54.875
You think you're a QB, right?

25:54.958 --> 25:57.000
Yes. Yes, sir. I know I am.

25:58.333 --> 26:02.875
I've been told you could always play DB
or safety if you choke.

26:03.875 --> 26:05.208
No, that won't happen.

26:06.041 --> 26:08.750
All I need is a shot.
That's all I ever needed.

26:12.041 --> 26:12.958
All right.

26:14.333 --> 26:16.416
Well, you got one now.

26:17.833 --> 26:18.750
Talk soon.

26:21.708 --> 26:23.958
-I'm playing football for Nevada.
-Yes!

26:24.041 --> 26:25.833
-I'm playing football for Nevada!
-Yes!

26:25.916 --> 26:27.875
I'm playing football for Nevada!

26:27.958 --> 26:28.791
-Yes!
-Oh, my God!

26:28.875 --> 26:29.750
Way to go!

26:29.833 --> 26:31.875
-Oh, my God!
-Yeah!

26:31.958 --> 26:33.875
-I'm gonna be a QB!

26:33.958 --> 26:35.333
I'm gonna be a QB!

26:35.416 --> 26:39.125
While I was in high school,
I felt a lot of different emotions.

26:39.208 --> 26:40.291
Mom!

26:40.916 --> 26:43.541
I'm playing for Nevada!

26:43.625 --> 26:44.625
Whoo!

26:44.708 --> 26:46.166
It was a rollercoaster.

26:47.125 --> 26:48.541
Sometimes fun.

26:49.291 --> 26:50.625
Sometimes scary.

26:51.416 --> 26:52.541
But you know what?

26:53.458 --> 26:55.791
I wouldn't trade
those moments for anything.

27:30.958 --> 27:32.833
Dear Colin.

27:34.083 --> 27:35.458
Trust your power.

27:36.041 --> 27:39.083
Even when you don't see it, believe it.

27:39.708 --> 27:41.500
Because you're going to need it.

27:42.333 --> 27:45.583
From your earliest days,
rejection will follow you.

27:45.666 --> 27:48.500
And it will be there
through every step of your journey.

27:49.750 --> 27:51.500
It will come from people who love you.

27:51.583 --> 27:53.666
Because you look like a thug!

27:53.750 --> 27:56.083
It'll come from people
who don't think you belong.

27:56.166 --> 27:58.625
Colin Kaepernick. Freshman team.

28:00.000 --> 28:01.875
It'll even come from a girl or two.

28:03.416 --> 28:06.083
But rejection is not failure.

28:06.166 --> 28:07.416
It's a calibrator.

28:07.500 --> 28:11.166
It can help you learn who you are
and what you want.

28:11.250 --> 28:13.833
And there's something you want
more than anything.

28:15.083 --> 28:16.916
You want to be a quarterback.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.708
Your path will sometimes be rough.

28:24.875 --> 28:26.375
But trust your power.

28:28.333 --> 28:31.833
When you face rejection
and feel like you wanna quit...

28:33.625 --> 28:35.000
trust your power.

28:36.291 --> 28:39.875
And when you see that you're rarely
anyone's first choice...

28:41.583 --> 28:43.458
trust your power.

28:43.541 --> 28:44.791
I promise you...

28:45.750 --> 28:48.416
when they say
you're not their first choice...

28:49.708 --> 28:52.000
you will show them
that you were the right choice.

28:53.125 --> 28:56.416
You will earn the title of quarterback
at the highest level.

28:58.916 --> 29:00.791
You will be a trailblazer.

29:05.541 --> 29:06.916
Don't throw your back out.

29:07.000 --> 29:07.833
I'm fine.

29:20.625 --> 29:22.708
I'll miss you, Mom, all right?

29:30.708 --> 29:31.750
I love you, Dad.

29:40.083 --> 29:43.208
But while you focus
on becoming a quarterback...

29:46.250 --> 29:48.208
something else will be happening.

29:51.625 --> 29:53.333
Something extraordinary.

29:58.500 --> 30:00.541
Something that you can feel,

30:00.625 --> 30:03.666
but don't have the words
or wisdom to articulate.

30:06.291 --> 30:08.708
You will learn to love who you are,

30:09.291 --> 30:13.291
and not give a damn that who you are
makes some people uncomfortable.

30:14.583 --> 30:18.125
You will know no matter how much
people try to control you...

30:19.250 --> 30:23.166
Is that what you want?
You wanna be somebody's second choice?

30:23.250 --> 30:25.125
...that they cannot break you.

30:26.583 --> 30:28.791
And you will learn to find beauty

30:28.875 --> 30:31.833
in places where the world
tells you there is none.

30:33.833 --> 30:35.625
And because of these things...

30:36.791 --> 30:42.083
you will know when people try to tell you
when and where you can be a quarterback,

30:42.166 --> 30:43.125
it doesn't matter.

30:45.291 --> 30:46.750
Because you will see...

30:47.500 --> 30:49.416
you are more than a quarterback.

30:50.291 --> 30:51.291
Much more.

31:26.833 --> 31:28.208
Trust your power.

31:31.375 --> 31:33.041
Love your Blackness.

31:34.708 --> 31:36.250
You will know who you are.

31:38.375 --> 31:41.208
Sincerely, Colin.
