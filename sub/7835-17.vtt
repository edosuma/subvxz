I was singing

has been observing
your puny species

14:33.665 --> 14:39.044

was created 5,000
years ago by God.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.171
In the name
of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Ghost.

14:41.256 --> 14:43.674
And now humanity
must be judged!

14:43.758 --> 14:46.802
The fate of your planet
rests on one human being,

14:46.886 --> 14:48.303
Homer Simpson!

14:48.388 --> 14:49.513
Why him?

14:49.597 --> 14:53.058
Because he is the fat,
selfish epitome
of modern man!
