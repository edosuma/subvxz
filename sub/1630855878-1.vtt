02:10.840 --> 02:14.300
- Pressure's all right, Gary?
- It's perfect.

02:17.630 --> 02:22.510
- And the oil is not too warm?
- It feels nice.

02:27.940 --> 02:31.560
Is there any area in particular
you want me to focus on today?

02:44.740 --> 02:45.910
You could...

02:49.580 --> 02:50.960
You could go...

02:54.170 --> 02:55.000
Lower?

03:34.590 --> 03:35.630
Oh, my God.

03:37.670 --> 03:40.050
I'm sorry, this music is triggering me.

03:40.930 --> 03:43.300
Can I change it
to something less traumatic?

03:44.510 --> 03:45.290
Sure.

03:45.490 --> 03:48.350
Kind of feels like
I was getting you off at a funeral.

03:52.560 --> 03:55.260
- You have a dope house, by the way.
- Thank you.

03:55.460 --> 03:56.520
It's, like, sexy.

04:03.780 --> 04:04.780
Oh, God.

04:13.960 --> 04:18.320
<i>Lick, lick, lick, lick</i>
<i>I wanna eat your dick</i>

04:18.520 --> 04:20.920
<i>But I can't fuck up my nails</i>

04:24.090 --> 04:28.460
- I'm so sorry. Cory, is it?
- Yeah, Kory. With a K.

04:28.660 --> 04:31.390
Could we just keep
the distractions to a minimum?

04:32.060 --> 04:35.420
I'm sorry.
I stopped taking my Vyvanse, and I have--

04:35.620 --> 04:36.940
It's okay. I'm just...

04:38.110 --> 04:40.320
- So the music, off?
- Please?

04:41.030 --> 04:41.860
Yeah.

04:58.750 --> 05:02.300
I'm so sorry. Is there any way
that you could not chew gum?

05:03.130 --> 05:04.590
Bitch, am I not allowed to breathe?

05:09.390 --> 05:12.210
- Gum's gone. Are we good?
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

05:12.410 --> 05:15.270
- It's fine. Can I proceed?
- Please. Thank you.

05:25.860 --> 05:29.120
So you have, like, a really big house.

05:31.120 --> 05:32.290
Who all lives here?

05:36.170 --> 05:37.110
Just me.

05:37.310 --> 05:38.690
Damn!

05:38.890 --> 05:40.750
No husband? No wife?

05:46.840 --> 05:49.910
- Wife. I had a wife.
- Word.

05:50.110 --> 05:53.850
I used to fuck girls too, and then
I realised I sucked at eating pussy.

05:55.270 --> 05:57.500
She left. She took the kids, and--

05:57.700 --> 05:59.650
What a bitch. Boys or girls?

06:00.440 --> 06:02.130
Boys. Well, men now, really.

06:02.330 --> 06:03.380
Are they hot?

06:03.580 --> 06:05.320
- What?
- Your two sons, are they hot?

06:06.070 --> 06:07.010
I don't know.

06:07.210 --> 06:10.560
Come on, Gary. You're clearly a fairy.
Or at least now you are.

06:10.760 --> 06:11.850
They're my children!

06:12.050 --> 06:15.830
It's not perverted.
My cousins are so fucking hot.

06:16.750 --> 06:18.670
I mean, they're good-looking young men.

06:19.710 --> 06:20.710
Okay.

06:21.380 --> 06:22.800
Jesus!

06:26.260 --> 06:29.930
Gary? How many guys
have you done this with?

06:35.390 --> 06:36.170
One?

06:36.370 --> 06:38.880
- One, like...
- Like, you're my first.

06:39.080 --> 06:42.520
- I'm your first massage?
- No. I mean, yes, but...

06:43.900 --> 06:46.690
You're the first guy
that I've ever been intimate with.

06:52.120 --> 06:56.020
- Gary, shut up.
- It's not a big deal.

06:56.220 --> 06:57.900
Gary, this is a big fucking deal.

06:58.100 --> 07:01.480
I need a drink. I need a drink.
Come on. Come on! Holy shit.

07:01.680 --> 07:02.880
Where are you going?

07:03.590 --> 07:06.210
So you've never touched a dick before?
Like, even as a kid?

07:08.050 --> 07:08.820
No.

07:09.020 --> 07:11.040
Oh, my God, Gary, that is so gay.

07:11.230 --> 07:12.450
I'm not supposed to drink, so--

07:12.650 --> 07:15.710
That is the most repressed Catholic-ass
bullshit I've ever heard in my life.

07:15.910 --> 07:18.250
I did jerk off once
in a steam room at our country club.

07:18.450 --> 07:20.670
Not even an Equinox? Jesus Christ, Gary.

07:20.870 --> 07:22.960
It was a long time ago.
The world's different now.

07:23.160 --> 07:25.470
Bitch, please.
The ancient Greeks were gay as shit.

07:25.670 --> 07:27.550
Zeus ate dick
for breakfast, lunch, and dinner!

07:27.750 --> 07:29.100
That's why he was so strong.

07:29.290 --> 07:30.240
All the cum.

07:32.110 --> 07:34.530
- What?
- You're a very spirited young man.

07:35.030 --> 07:36.140
You know what is so funny?

07:36.340 --> 07:39.540
People say shit like that all the time,
and I never know what it means.

07:45.170 --> 07:49.010
But this isn't about me.
This is about you.

07:49.630 --> 07:51.630
I wanna know, why now?

07:52.680 --> 07:54.370
I can't believe I'm telling you this.

07:54.570 --> 07:58.460
I got married so young, had kids so young
that I never gave myself an opportunity--

07:58.660 --> 08:02.250
Holy shit! I didn't even think about that.
Your kids are so lucky.

08:02.450 --> 08:03.590
- Why?
- They have a gay dad.

08:03.790 --> 08:07.470
- What's better than that?
- I doubt they see it that way, Kory.

08:07.670 --> 08:09.050
Please, call me Cameron.

08:09.250 --> 08:11.550
Kory's the work name,
it helps me get into character.

08:11.750 --> 08:13.160
But you and I are friends now.

08:14.620 --> 08:15.450
Okay.

08:17.080 --> 08:21.690
Well, Cameron,
my kids don't talk to me, so...

08:21.890 --> 08:25.610
What? Sorry, you're telling me
that your family won't talk to you

08:25.810 --> 08:28.200
because you prefer bussy over pussy?

08:28.400 --> 08:29.320
What the actual fuck?

08:29.520 --> 08:32.490
Patty had her reasons. She took the kids--

08:32.690 --> 08:36.700
God! Patty? Oh, Patty!
Patty's a very, very cunty name, Gary.

08:36.900 --> 08:40.670
- Cameron.
- No! I'm sorry, Gary, that is bullshit.

08:40.870 --> 08:42.630
Bullshit.

08:42.830 --> 08:45.920
You were honest, and they turn their back
on you 'cause of your sexuality?

08:46.120 --> 08:48.760
I'll talk to that bitch.
I'm a people person. Give me your phone.

08:48.960 --> 08:50.130
No. You don't have to--

08:50.330 --> 08:52.180
The only thing better
than my dad being gay

08:52.380 --> 08:54.470
would have been him being
like a reiki master.

08:54.670 --> 08:57.160
I would have killed
to have a dad like you.

08:59.910 --> 09:00.990
I'm dying.

09:02.200 --> 09:04.900
Oh, baby, I'm dying too.
I mean, every night I fall asleep--

09:05.100 --> 09:06.580
I'm actually dying.

09:08.500 --> 09:10.630
I have an inoperable brain tumour.

09:14.170 --> 09:15.180
Oh, shit.

09:26.400 --> 09:30.300
I'm sorry.
I really don't know what to say.

09:30.500 --> 09:32.380
Words of affirmation
is not my love language.

09:32.580 --> 09:33.820
It's more like...

09:36.240 --> 09:40.230
Okay. You don't have to worry about
not knowing how to respond.

09:40.430 --> 09:43.150
Nobody's reacted that well thus far,
myself included.

09:43.350 --> 09:45.690
Oh, Gary. Are you okay?

09:45.890 --> 09:48.290
I mean, I know you're not okay, obviously.
But I mean...

09:49.250 --> 09:53.450
It's like I just realised that
I've been alive for nearly half a century

09:53.650 --> 09:56.430
and I haven't actually lived
even a second of it.

09:58.220 --> 10:02.250
Okay. Okay, Gary.
Gary, I'm gonna help you.

10:02.450 --> 10:04.880
- What?
- Let's find someone for you.

10:05.080 --> 10:07.920
Someone you've always wanted
who will put what you want first.

10:08.120 --> 10:11.090
Honestly, can't you just finish
the hand job and go?

10:11.290 --> 10:15.550
Oh, shut up.
Shut up, Gary. We're doing this.

10:15.750 --> 10:17.240
You are gonna do this.

10:17.740 --> 10:21.140
Now, have you heard of Plungr?

10:21.340 --> 10:22.350
No.

10:22.550 --> 10:23.480
It's a sex app.

10:23.680 --> 10:27.160
Why do I need a sex app?
I literally paid for you.

10:27.790 --> 10:30.730
Because you're not gay
until you've hooked up

10:30.930 --> 10:34.210
with a complete stranger on an app,
who looks nothing like their pictures.

10:34.800 --> 10:36.240
- Okay.
- Okay, so crash course.

10:36.440 --> 10:39.870
Basically, once you set up your profile,
then you put in your stats.

10:40.070 --> 10:40.950
That's the basics.

10:41.150 --> 10:44.500
Your height, your body type,
your pronouns, your positions.

10:44.700 --> 10:47.170
- Top, bottom. We'll figure it out later.
- Jesus.

10:47.370 --> 10:50.750
Your relationship status,
date last tested, et cetera.

10:50.950 --> 10:54.130
And boom! You're getting your hole licked,
your salad tossed,

10:54.330 --> 10:56.550
your carpet munched
by your closeted neighbour--

10:56.750 --> 10:58.510
I'm sorry, this is a lot to take in.

10:58.710 --> 11:01.530
It's a lot, Gary.
I wish they had a gay Duolingo.

11:04.120 --> 11:05.120
You know what?

11:06.160 --> 11:09.210
Why don't you see for yourself?

11:10.120 --> 11:10.960
Go on.

11:22.640 --> 11:25.310
Oh, my God. There's so many hot guys.

11:26.890 --> 11:28.040
Yes, there are.

11:28.240 --> 11:31.190
But if you wanna talk to any of them,
you're gonna need an avatar.

11:31.690 --> 11:34.900
Profile picture. You're gonna need it,
or no one's gonna answer.

11:35.400 --> 11:39.090
Do you know what lighting in your house
makes you the most dewy?

11:39.290 --> 11:42.430
- Can we just use a picture of you?
- Seriously?

11:42.630 --> 11:45.640
Look at you.
I'm not gonna get very many responses.

11:45.840 --> 11:48.600
Not with that attitude.
Do you know your angles?

11:48.800 --> 11:50.810
- My angles?
- Oh, for fuck's sake, Gary.

11:51.010 --> 11:53.290
Come on,
I can't just teach you everything.

11:57.380 --> 11:58.210
Hot?

11:59.050 --> 12:01.410
Yeah, that's very hot.

12:01.610 --> 12:02.380
I know.

12:02.880 --> 12:08.180
I'll just call us "Lad and Dad."

12:09.390 --> 12:10.230
Okay.

12:15.560 --> 12:16.770
How about this guy?

12:17.900 --> 12:19.470
Two miles away.

12:19.670 --> 12:23.220
"Dom Top, DL, Masc4masc, I love to suck."

12:23.420 --> 12:25.600
- What's DL?
- That's down-low, just like you.

12:25.800 --> 12:28.830
Well, I like his hat.

12:30.660 --> 12:31.500
Okay.

12:32.500 --> 12:35.460
"I like your hat, bro. You're hot."

12:39.050 --> 12:41.240
- "You too."
- Wait, he already wrote back to you?

12:41.440 --> 12:45.010
Yep. "Come over and drain me."

12:45.510 --> 12:49.000
Okay, I'm sorry. No, Cameron,
I think this might be too much.

12:49.200 --> 12:50.920
- Too late. He's on his way.
- Wait. What?

12:51.120 --> 12:51.830
I dropped a pin.

12:52.030 --> 12:53.290
- You gave him my address?
- Yeah.

12:53.490 --> 12:55.210
But I might not be ready for this.

12:55.410 --> 12:57.670
It took me a week
to work up the courage to call you.

12:57.870 --> 13:01.590
And now you've invited
some complete stranger to my home.

13:01.790 --> 13:03.800
- Gary.
- I don't even know this person.

13:04.000 --> 13:05.760
- How am I supposed to react?
- Loosen up.

13:05.960 --> 13:07.220
- How?
- You're with me.

13:07.420 --> 13:12.860
I'm like human poppers. I open anyone up.
All you have to do is sit back and relax.

13:13.050 --> 13:14.040
Relax.

13:14.540 --> 13:16.630
You're gonna be okay, I prom.

13:17.630 --> 13:18.540
Prom?

13:19.040 --> 13:20.240
Half a promise.

13:20.440 --> 13:23.320
- Did you just make that up?
- Oh, my God. It's New York, Gary.

13:23.520 --> 13:26.260
The reality star.
Oh, you have so much to learn.

13:26.930 --> 13:28.350
I'm going to your kitchen.

13:39.360 --> 13:42.900
Gary, it's so harsh in here.
You need to liven it up.

13:44.240 --> 13:48.200
<i>Spoon, spoon, spoon...</i>

13:48.870 --> 13:52.160
Shit. You really are dying, aren't you?

14:04.670 --> 14:06.580
"Gary and Patricia had
a beautiful marriage,

14:06.770 --> 14:08.080
filled with blessing and love.

14:08.280 --> 14:11.710
The life they shared was harmonious
and fulfilling, raising the boys.

14:11.900 --> 14:16.640
However, Gary has now left the marriage
to finally pursue his life as a gay man.

14:18.060 --> 14:20.920
There are no words to describe
the shock and heartache Patricia feels

14:21.120 --> 14:22.690
regarding Gary's new path."

14:23.780 --> 14:25.190
Yikademente.

14:26.570 --> 14:28.360
Gary! Oh, my God.

14:29.160 --> 14:33.020
Okay, can we please talk about this?
Because what the actual fuck?

14:33.220 --> 14:35.330
- Where did you get that?
- I went through your shit.

14:35.950 --> 14:36.790
Of course.

14:39.580 --> 14:44.660
After the split, Patty lashed out
in interesting and craft-based ways.

14:44.850 --> 14:47.030
It's on, like, weighted paper.

14:47.230 --> 14:50.080
You're telling me she went to Kinko's
and printed how many copies?

14:50.280 --> 14:53.290
She sent them
to quite a number of people in our lives.

14:53.490 --> 14:57.270
Gary, it's like a eulogy for straight you.
Rest in peace.

14:57.770 --> 15:00.440
- Well...
- At least you got to keep the house.

15:00.940 --> 15:05.090
When I came out of the closet, I lost
the closet and the room the closet was in.

15:05.290 --> 15:07.010
Is that why you ended up doing this?

15:07.210 --> 15:09.050
The fuck do you mean by that?

15:09.250 --> 15:13.020
Your line of work is not exactly
many people's first choice.

15:13.220 --> 15:15.060
A little fucking judgemental,
don't you think?

15:15.260 --> 15:19.160
I'm just saying,
kids wanna be astronauts, firemen.

15:19.660 --> 15:21.750
They don't pick sex worker
at the job fair.

15:22.710 --> 15:26.840
They would if they were tossed around
as an 8-year-old, like I was.

15:29.420 --> 15:33.200
I'm fucking joking. Are you serious?
That's what you actually think?

15:33.400 --> 15:36.250
That something terrible must have happened
to me to lead me to this?

15:36.450 --> 15:39.630
God forbid I found something
that I'm good at, and I monetised it.

15:39.830 --> 15:42.670
But you can't do this forever.
When you're my age, what will you do?

15:42.870 --> 15:47.050
I don't know. I guess I'll repress
every desire that comes naturally,

15:47.250 --> 15:49.680
marry an unsuspecting woman,
have two sons,

15:49.880 --> 15:51.850
live a lie
until I find out I'm dying of cancer.

15:52.050 --> 15:55.560
- Hey, whoa.
- No! No, you are on thin ice, sweetie.

15:55.760 --> 15:58.150
I'm sorry. You're right.

15:58.340 --> 16:03.040
I guess that
that was my poor attempt at helping you.

16:04.790 --> 16:07.590
Well, write this down
and remember it fondly:

16:08.340 --> 16:10.260
I don't need your fucking help.

16:13.550 --> 16:14.390
God!

16:26.020 --> 16:28.630
My God, if that was my best stab
at fatherly advice,

16:28.830 --> 16:31.010
it's no wonder
my own kids don't wanna speak to me.

16:31.210 --> 16:33.740
Okay, enough of this whole pity party.

16:34.740 --> 16:35.620
What is that?

16:37.240 --> 16:38.640
It's called pre-workout.

16:38.840 --> 16:41.310
- Like meth for people with goals.
- Why are you taking it now?

16:41.510 --> 16:44.820
You didn't have Red Bull.
Which, by the way, big mistake.

16:45.020 --> 16:47.150
- Big. Huge.
<i>- Pretty Woman.</i>

16:47.350 --> 16:49.610
Finally, a fucking reference you know.

16:49.810 --> 16:51.820
<i>Pretty Woman</i> is one of my favourite films.

16:52.020 --> 16:54.240
That would explain
your attitude towards sex work.

16:54.440 --> 16:57.950
- Well, you're the one who just quoted it.
- Touché, bitch.

16:58.150 --> 17:01.790
- Yeah.
- Oh, fuck. He's here. He's here!

17:01.990 --> 17:03.130
Oh, my God, what do I do?

17:03.330 --> 17:06.760
Hey. Go upstairs,
wear something sexy, I got this covered.

17:06.950 --> 17:08.900
- Go! Go!
- Okay.

17:14.070 --> 17:15.110
Sexy.

17:18.660 --> 17:20.700
- Hello.
- 'Sup, bro?

17:22.450 --> 17:24.980
- Fist me already!
- I'm Sammy.

17:25.180 --> 17:29.090
I'm Kory, with a K. The lost Kardashian.
Nice truck.

17:30.300 --> 17:31.740
You parked so far.

17:31.940 --> 17:35.090
- Just wanna get in and get out.
- Oh. You can get in, all right.

17:39.300 --> 17:40.140
Come on.

17:42.430 --> 17:46.020
This place is dope, man.
Do you live here alone?

17:46.900 --> 17:51.520
Well, if you noticed on Plungr,
I am Lad...

17:53.490 --> 17:56.650
and this is Dad.

17:58.570 --> 17:59.640
Hi.

17:59.840 --> 18:03.100
Who the fuck is
this Mister Rogers-looking-ass dude?

18:03.300 --> 18:05.810
I thought I told you
to wear something sexy.

18:06.010 --> 18:07.480
I feel very sexy in this.

18:07.680 --> 18:10.650
The profile said "Lad and Dad."

18:10.850 --> 18:13.360
You didn't say
nothing about a threesome, so...

18:13.560 --> 18:15.870
And you didn't say anything
about being a whiny bottom.

18:16.070 --> 18:18.370
- But here we are.
- I'm no bottom! I'm all top.

18:18.570 --> 18:21.710
- Yeah, sure, you self-hating little bitch.
- Cameron.

18:21.900 --> 18:23.040
Shut the fuck up, please.

18:23.240 --> 18:28.310
We both know you're just a gaping hole,
so pipe down and service this cock!

18:32.730 --> 18:34.300
Fuck, you're sexy.

18:34.500 --> 18:36.850
You know you don't deserve
to suck this cock, though, right?

18:37.040 --> 18:37.820
I know.

18:39.820 --> 18:43.030
I'm sorry, sir.
I'll suck it so good, though.

18:43.870 --> 18:44.700
Do it.

18:48.040 --> 18:49.920
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

18:57.920 --> 18:59.680
Oh, yeah. Fuck, yeah.

19:03.470 --> 19:06.000
You shut your fucking mouth
when you're sucking this dick.

19:06.200 --> 19:09.210
- Please, sir, I want some more.
- Yeah, you do.

19:09.410 --> 19:13.300
Yeah, you like that dick,
you little Oliver Twist-ass bitch?

19:13.500 --> 19:17.030
Oh, God. It's like a juicy bratwurst.

19:18.150 --> 19:22.450
You make me...
You make me sick, you little orphan boy.

19:23.450 --> 19:24.780
I'm an orphan.

19:25.830 --> 19:27.730
Fucking deeper, bitch.

19:27.930 --> 19:29.360
You little street urchin.

19:29.560 --> 19:33.040
You little begging bitch
with your little purple-ass shorts.

19:33.540 --> 19:36.670
I'm your fucking street urchin,
motherfucker.

19:39.550 --> 19:40.550
Come on, Dad.

19:41.680 --> 19:42.510
Come on.

19:44.050 --> 19:45.260
- Fuck me.
- It's okay.

19:47.140 --> 19:50.770
Oh, yes. You gotta
put it fucking deep in there.

19:55.860 --> 19:57.510
Wait. Why are you stopping?

19:57.710 --> 19:59.550
- I can't do this.
- Can't do what?

19:59.750 --> 20:01.600
Suck a dick
when your username's Looking2Succ?

20:01.800 --> 20:03.810
Not with this
accountant-looking motherfucker.

20:04.010 --> 20:06.350
- I'm sorry.
- Gary is a beautiful man

20:06.550 --> 20:09.020
who deserves anonymous blowjobs,
just like the rest of us.

20:09.220 --> 20:10.310
He looks like shit.

20:10.510 --> 20:15.400
- You look like shit, little pencil dick!
- What? I'm not even fully hard, bro.

20:15.600 --> 20:16.490
Oh, really?

20:16.690 --> 20:19.570
Plus, I didn't get
to showcase my personality.

20:19.770 --> 20:20.820
Oh, my God!

20:21.020 --> 20:24.950
Looking2Succ, I've given you plenty
of time to showcase your personality.

20:25.150 --> 20:29.080
Fuck you. I'm better one-on-one.
And it was just you in the picture.

20:29.280 --> 20:32.790
Not your <i>Flowers in the Attic</i>
fucking sidepiece daddy.

20:32.990 --> 20:34.550
I'm not even gay, anyway.

20:34.750 --> 20:37.470
You just casually referenced
<i>Flowers in the Attic.</i>

20:37.670 --> 20:40.590
- You are an absolute faggot!
- I got a wife.

20:40.790 --> 20:42.260
- So does he!
- Ex-wife.

20:42.460 --> 20:46.430
And you'll be adding ex to the title
when she finds out you're a bottom!

20:46.630 --> 20:48.640
Watch your fucking mouth, bro!

20:48.840 --> 20:51.100
I'm warning you, I will knock you out.

20:51.300 --> 20:56.650
Oh, no. He's gonna knock me out, Gary,
hit me with his <i>Flowers in the Attic.</i>

20:56.850 --> 20:57.650
Okay. Boys. Boys.

20:57.850 --> 21:04.450
- You are a F-A-double G-O-T, faggot!
- This is your last fucking warning, bro!

21:04.650 --> 21:06.510
- You're a faggot!
- Fuck you!

21:53.390 --> 21:54.730
It was a gorgeous landing.

22:02.360 --> 22:05.850
- Why would you do that?
- Do what?

22:06.050 --> 22:08.350
You instigated him. You riled him up.

22:08.550 --> 22:09.810
Hey, hold on, hold on.

22:10.010 --> 22:12.560
He literally charged at me
and you pushed me out of the way.

22:12.760 --> 22:14.040
How is this my fault?

22:14.830 --> 22:17.960
If you had shut up,
he wouldn't have done the charging.

22:18.830 --> 22:20.780
Of course, you're gonna take his side.

22:20.980 --> 22:23.820
Two repressed queers blaming
their shame and misery on me,

22:24.020 --> 22:26.280
- a secure, stable homosexual.
- Stable?

22:26.480 --> 22:29.390
- Yeah.
- How did I let this happen? My God!

22:30.090 --> 22:32.500
Wait, this whole thing was your idea.
The whole thing.

22:32.700 --> 22:34.500
No, no, no! You wanted him to come here.

22:34.700 --> 22:37.000
You practically forced me into this.

22:37.200 --> 22:40.130
Oh, I forced you
to hook up with two hot dudes.

22:40.330 --> 22:43.020
I'm so evil, Gary. Oh, I'm so sorry.

22:49.450 --> 22:50.810
What are you doing?

22:51.010 --> 22:53.350
- I'm calling 911.
- For what? He's dead!

22:53.550 --> 22:55.650
Exactly. We have to explain what happened.

22:55.850 --> 23:00.320
You may be okay going to jail 'cause
you're dying, but I'm freshly made.

23:00.520 --> 23:03.030
- I don't care. I'm calling.
- Gary, no. Accidents happen!

23:03.230 --> 23:05.860
It was your first time being gay.
You were gonna make mistakes.

23:06.060 --> 23:08.370
- This is more than a mistake!
- You're right.

23:08.570 --> 23:10.540
I'm so glad
you're man enough to admit that.

23:10.730 --> 23:12.640
- Admit what?
- You assaulted me.

23:14.390 --> 23:16.880
- You fucking kidding me?
- You pushed me, babe.

23:17.070 --> 23:21.270
You pushed me and my lover is dead!
That's what I'm gonna tell the cops.

23:23.360 --> 23:27.180
I can't believe that you would pin this
on me when all I did was protect you.

23:27.380 --> 23:28.760
Protect me, really?

23:28.960 --> 23:30.970
He was gonna beat you up.
I saved your life.

23:31.170 --> 23:32.310
Don't be so dramatic, Gary.

23:32.510 --> 23:34.560
You both would have flown out
of that window,

23:34.760 --> 23:36.480
which now seems like a missed opportunity!

23:36.680 --> 23:38.830
Okay, so don't ever try
and save my life again, then!

23:39.460 --> 23:41.370
I pray that I don't have the chance!

23:42.750 --> 23:44.590
No, Cameron,
you can't walk away from this.

23:45.460 --> 23:46.750
It's your fault!

23:47.550 --> 23:51.930
You know what? You say that one more time,
I swear to God!

23:52.430 --> 23:56.290
When you first told me about your family,
I felt bad for you. I really did.

23:56.490 --> 23:58.080
But you know what? I feel bad for them,

23:58.280 --> 24:01.750
'cause you're that classic closet case
that loves to look like the hero

24:01.950 --> 24:03.090
while playing the victim.

24:03.290 --> 24:07.090
Maybe accept the fact that
you ruined more lives than you saved.

24:07.290 --> 24:09.780
You don't know a fucking thing
about me and my family.

24:10.280 --> 24:12.160
Oh, thank God for that.

24:12.820 --> 24:15.580
It's your house, Gary. Your window.

24:16.160 --> 24:19.000
Every man for himself.
I'm fucking out of here.

24:19.790 --> 24:22.520
You are a pest! You are a menace!

24:22.720 --> 24:25.070
You are a selfish, spoiled boy,
and I have no use for you!

24:25.270 --> 24:28.210
I don't wanna see you or know you!
Get out of my house!

24:28.800 --> 24:31.220
- Is that from<i> Dennis the Menace?</i>
- Go!

24:32.840 --> 24:34.390
Fuck you, Gary!

25:40.740 --> 25:41.910
Oh, God.

25:43.000 --> 25:43.830
Okay.

25:44.410 --> 25:45.250
Okay.

26:09.860 --> 26:10.900
Fuck.

26:19.200 --> 26:20.950
So where are we taking him?

26:22.030 --> 26:23.520
- Why?
- Don't look at me like that.

26:23.720 --> 26:27.710
You're weak, I feel sorry for you,
and thank you for saving my life.

26:28.670 --> 26:31.960
I think he shit himself.
Just grab his hands, come on.

26:34.550 --> 26:35.630
Fuck!

26:36.800 --> 26:40.290
Okay. So should we drag him to the shore,

26:40.490 --> 26:42.870
fill his pockets with rocks,
and then throw him in the lake?

26:43.070 --> 26:46.130
What? Did you just come up with that?

26:46.330 --> 26:47.420
Yeah. Why?

26:47.620 --> 26:49.750
Because that's almost exactly
what we did with Duke.

26:49.950 --> 26:52.720
- Who the fuck is Duke?
- My only real friend.

26:52.920 --> 26:56.680
- Who the fuck are you, Robert Durst?
- Jesus Christ, Cameron!

26:56.880 --> 26:59.760
Duke was a Weimaraner,
who I loved very, very much.

26:59.960 --> 27:02.680
- A who?
- A dog. Duke was a dog.

27:02.880 --> 27:05.480
He loved the water.
It was a fitting send-off.

27:05.680 --> 27:07.810
But dogs don't wear pants.

27:08.010 --> 27:09.790
Oh, God. Cameron, pick him up.

27:11.670 --> 27:15.570
We're dealing with a human body,
a human dead body.

27:15.770 --> 27:18.990
He's gonna smell. He's gonna rot.

27:19.190 --> 27:23.500
He's got a family, a wife who probably
hates him but doesn't want him dead.

27:23.700 --> 27:25.970
Are we talking about the body or you?

27:42.990 --> 27:44.740
I should just take the fall.

27:45.240 --> 27:49.150
No. I don't want Patty
to have to make another calling card.

27:49.350 --> 27:54.280
"After a few months as a homosexual man,
Gary decided to lead a life of crime."

27:54.480 --> 27:57.090
With a wilted rose
as the background this time?

27:57.670 --> 27:58.960
Stunning.

28:12.520 --> 28:14.310
I'm really glad you came back.

28:16.690 --> 28:17.860
Me too.

28:23.660 --> 28:25.850
Oh, fuck! He bled through the tarp!

28:26.050 --> 28:28.730
That's mountain ash wood,
it's really porous.

28:28.930 --> 28:32.500
Oh, my God, you're so gay.
How did nobody know?

28:33.670 --> 28:35.880
Shut up and help me move this thing.

29:09.240 --> 29:12.020
Oh, my God.
Did you invite somebody else over?

29:12.220 --> 29:14.360
- You think I double-booked you?
- Well, did you?

29:14.560 --> 29:15.270
Of course I didn't.

29:15.470 --> 29:17.490
- Answer it.
- I don't wanna answer it.

29:17.680 --> 29:19.750
We can't answer the door.
I have no idea who it is.

29:21.210 --> 29:22.370
Oh, fuck.

29:22.560 --> 29:24.180
Avon lady calling!

29:25.510 --> 29:26.450
It's Sandy.

29:26.650 --> 29:28.620
- Who the fuck is Sandy?
- My neighbour.

29:28.820 --> 29:29.890
Oh, shit.

29:30.560 --> 29:31.500
Gary!

29:31.700 --> 29:35.060
What am I supposed to do?
I'm completely covered in blood.

29:35.810 --> 29:36.940
I know what to do.

29:37.810 --> 29:39.170
Where are you going?

29:39.370 --> 29:42.180
Gary? Is that you?

29:42.380 --> 29:44.180
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

29:44.380 --> 29:46.930
Hello? Gary?

29:47.130 --> 29:49.230
- That's Patty's apron.
- Not anymore.

29:49.420 --> 29:51.310
- What are you gonna do?
- Answer the door.

29:51.510 --> 29:56.670
- No, no, you can't answer the door.
- I'm gonna answer the fucking door.

30:00.420 --> 30:01.200
Hi.

30:01.400 --> 30:02.780
You're not Gary.

30:02.980 --> 30:06.740
No. No, no, no.
I'm cute, and you must be pretty.

30:06.940 --> 30:09.510
So together that means we're pretty cute.

30:15.560 --> 30:18.840
You're a hoot! I'm Sandy.

30:19.040 --> 30:22.940
Oh, Sandy, what brings you over here
this beautiful night?

30:23.780 --> 30:26.610
I should be asking you the same question.

30:29.910 --> 30:32.350
That's so like Gary. A man of few words.

30:32.550 --> 30:36.730
I'm his real estate agent, Kory.
Kory Haim.

30:36.930 --> 30:39.940
- Like the actor?
- No, you're thinking of Feldman.

30:40.140 --> 30:41.780
No, there was two Coreys.

30:41.980 --> 30:45.760
- There was Corey Feldman and Corey Haim.
- No, there's just one.

30:46.550 --> 30:49.240
- Thank you for coming.
- Gary!

30:49.440 --> 30:54.120
Hey, you're not in that gorgeous
little palazzo across the way, are you?

30:54.320 --> 30:57.710
Where is Gary?
And why are you here so late at night?

30:57.910 --> 31:01.510
Oh, I'm doing an inspection. Smog.

31:01.710 --> 31:05.840
You know, I thought I heard
the faint sounds of screaming earlier,

31:06.040 --> 31:08.010
and I thought, well, Gary's home,

31:08.210 --> 31:12.770
so naturally I thought I would come on by
on my way to the store.

31:12.970 --> 31:16.600
But I gotta hit the road
before the Ambien kicks in.

31:16.800 --> 31:20.780
- I think it already kicked in.
- Stat! Like they say on <i>Grey's.</i>

31:20.970 --> 31:23.460
Oh! Are you a McDreamy girl?

31:24.300 --> 31:25.860
All the way.

31:26.060 --> 31:28.170
I could see it in your eyes, Sandy.

31:32.640 --> 31:35.560
I just need some flour...

31:36.350 --> 31:40.170
to make my chocolate chip banana bread
for my church group in the morning.

31:40.370 --> 31:43.710
Sure, yeah. Not keto, but very Christian.

31:43.910 --> 31:48.190
We just pray so hard
that the carbs don't stick to our hips.

31:53.200 --> 31:56.230
You know what? I just realised something.

31:56.430 --> 31:58.520
- I know where Gary keeps the flour.
- Wow.

31:58.720 --> 32:02.020
Yeah.
So why don't you just wait right here?

32:02.220 --> 32:05.740
- Right here. Sit, stay.
- Right there. Sit, stay. Sit, stay.

32:05.940 --> 32:09.920
Don't move. Good girl. Good girl.
I'll be right back. Yeah, okay.

32:14.180 --> 32:15.800
He's wearing an apron.

32:19.980 --> 32:21.520
One more won't hurt.

32:25.980 --> 32:27.650
Shit, shit, shit.

32:30.030 --> 32:32.400
Where is the flour? Fuck, fuck, fuck!

32:32.990 --> 32:35.410
- I know.
- What?

32:36.530 --> 32:40.230
You don't have to hide it.
I caught you red-handed.

32:40.430 --> 32:44.940
Okay. Look, it was a whole mistake,
and one thing lead to another--

32:45.140 --> 32:48.420
The heart wants what the heart wants.

32:49.550 --> 32:52.490
- What?
- I got Patty's card.

32:52.690 --> 32:54.340
The whole neighbourhood did.

32:54.930 --> 32:57.370
You don't have to be ashamed
of loving him.

32:57.570 --> 33:00.390
Gary's a wonderful man.

33:03.310 --> 33:05.000
I'm so close to Patty still.

33:05.200 --> 33:07.970
She's just sick over the whole thing.

33:08.170 --> 33:10.590
She feels terribly about what she did
and how she reacted.

33:10.790 --> 33:13.140
But now he won't talk to her or the boys.

33:13.340 --> 33:14.810
And I know he's hurt,

33:15.010 --> 33:18.390
but she really worries about him,
especially now all by himself--

33:18.590 --> 33:21.870
I'm sorry. Patty...
Patty wants to talk to Gary?

33:23.120 --> 33:26.780
Oh, more than anything.

33:26.980 --> 33:31.510
She's been begging him
to at least just clear the air before he--

33:32.510 --> 33:33.800
You know, just...

33:35.510 --> 33:36.890
Right. That's...

33:38.640 --> 33:39.870
I didn't know that.

33:40.070 --> 33:41.460
I did not know that.

33:41.660 --> 33:44.850
Well, must be awkward.

33:46.400 --> 33:47.840
- For Gary.
- Yeah.

33:48.040 --> 33:52.480
He must not tell you things about the ex.

33:53.740 --> 33:54.930
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

33:55.130 --> 34:01.950
So all that's to say,
no more sneaking around, Mr Estate Agent.

34:02.450 --> 34:06.190
I'm a cool Christian.
I'm down with the gays.

34:06.390 --> 34:09.590
I may just not bake a cake
for your wedding.

34:10.540 --> 34:13.490
Yeah, well, you already established
you don't have any flour.

34:13.690 --> 34:15.870
Yeah! You got me there!

34:16.070 --> 34:20.120
Oh, where's Gary?
I wanna see you two sinners in action.

34:20.320 --> 34:21.500
Gary!

34:21.700 --> 34:24.020
What the fuck?

34:27.140 --> 34:29.480
- Gary.
- Sandy!

34:30.860 --> 34:34.860
Honey! You did not spill all those cosmos!

34:35.740 --> 34:36.570
Cosmos?

34:37.360 --> 34:41.770
Yes! You got the whole pitcher
right down the front of you.

34:41.970 --> 34:43.640
- Cosmos?
- Yes.

34:43.840 --> 34:47.310
Yes, we were having
<i>Sex and the City </i>role-play night.

34:47.510 --> 34:48.460
Yes.

34:56.300 --> 34:59.290
Well, let's get another pitcher going,

34:59.480 --> 35:05.180
because I'm Samantha, and I love fucking.

35:08.940 --> 35:10.800
Yes, you do, you little scamp.

35:11.000 --> 35:14.190
Church girls know how to kneel.

35:15.280 --> 35:19.640
I'm gonna just make
some more cosmos, then.

35:19.840 --> 35:22.520
- You are such a fucking Charlotte.
- This is so exciting!

35:22.720 --> 35:26.830
It's been ages
since I've had a girls' night like this.

35:28.830 --> 35:30.440
Where's the bathroom again?

35:30.640 --> 35:35.240
I... When I get excited,
I get a little loose down there.

35:35.440 --> 35:36.820
Oh, Jesus.

35:37.020 --> 35:39.620
Okay, I'm gonna just cue up
the second movie.

35:39.820 --> 35:41.240
Everyone's favourite.

35:41.440 --> 35:43.140
Bathroom's right to the left.

35:46.720 --> 35:48.680
Right to the left.

35:52.940 --> 35:54.150
Right to the left.

35:57.480 --> 35:59.260
Why are we watching <i>Sex and the City 2?</i>

35:59.460 --> 36:01.760
You are being such an Aidan.
I need you to be a Mr Big.

36:01.960 --> 36:05.410
- I have no idea what that even means.
- At least I tell the truth, you bitch.

36:06.120 --> 36:07.160
- What?
- Shut up!

36:07.790 --> 36:08.620
Right...

36:10.210 --> 36:11.710
to the left.

36:12.420 --> 36:15.920
We can dump the body
after <i>Sex and the City, </i>but now, chill.

36:19.090 --> 36:23.910
- Oh, my God! Oh, God! Oh, God!
- Sandy, this is not what it looks like.

36:24.110 --> 36:26.510
- It's not?
- No, it's not.

36:27.100 --> 36:28.890
Okay.

36:29.560 --> 36:31.460
You're right, it's not.

36:31.660 --> 36:33.900
- Sandy...
- You know what? Just...

36:34.400 --> 36:41.140
Let's just 86 the request on the flour,

36:41.340 --> 36:48.200
because I just remembered
that I have some in my pool.

36:50.200 --> 36:53.440
And I would just like to add here,

36:53.640 --> 36:58.400
in no way do I believe
that you are going to hell,

36:58.600 --> 37:02.660
at least not just for being gay.

37:02.860 --> 37:08.870
So I'm just gonna find my way to the door
and then I'm gonna be out of here!

37:09.070 --> 37:10.290
Sandy, wait!

37:10.490 --> 37:12.670
You're gay,
you're supposed to be nice people!

37:12.870 --> 37:13.640
Please.

37:14.440 --> 37:15.420
Sandy.

37:15.620 --> 37:16.760
You locked me in!

37:16.960 --> 37:18.220
No. No, no. Sandy.

37:18.420 --> 37:20.010
You're trying to kill me!

37:20.210 --> 37:23.320
- We're not. It's unlocked, actually.
- Pull, don't push, hon.

37:25.110 --> 37:26.990
Sandy! Sandy!

37:28.530 --> 37:29.950
Sandy! Sandy!

37:30.660 --> 37:32.400
- Sandy!
- Sandykins!

37:32.600 --> 37:33.790
Sandy?

37:34.670 --> 37:35.710
Sandy?

37:38.750 --> 37:40.070
We're not gonna hurt you, babe!

37:40.270 --> 37:42.590
Is she astral-projecting?
Where the fuck did she go?

37:49.180 --> 37:49.960
Sandy?

37:50.160 --> 37:51.290
Sandy.

37:51.490 --> 37:52.430
Sandy!

37:52.930 --> 37:53.880
Come out, babe.

37:54.080 --> 37:54.850
Sandy!

38:01.730 --> 38:02.730
Sandy!

38:06.950 --> 38:07.950
Gary?

38:08.910 --> 38:12.690
I have just taken a fistful of drugs,

38:12.890 --> 38:16.520
and I will be sedated or dead
within minutes,

38:16.720 --> 38:21.650
feeling none of the sick,
twisted, homosexual depravity

38:21.850 --> 38:25.970
you subject my Christ-like body to!

38:27.130 --> 38:27.970
Pills!

38:30.100 --> 38:31.410
- Sandy!
- Sandy!

38:31.610 --> 38:32.390
Sandy!

38:42.400 --> 38:43.440
Sandy?

38:44.650 --> 38:45.780
Sandy?

38:46.490 --> 38:49.600
- What in the <i>Hoarders </i>hell?
- Welcome to my old life.

38:49.800 --> 38:53.190
Sandy, listen. I'm really concerned
about the amount of pills you've taken.

38:53.380 --> 38:57.250
And if you have more,
I would absolutely buy them off of you.

38:59.920 --> 39:00.750
Where is she?

39:02.590 --> 39:04.450
- She's not here.
- Of course she's not here.

39:04.650 --> 39:06.820
Why do you even have a dog cage?

39:07.020 --> 39:08.160
It was Duke's.

39:08.360 --> 39:10.950
Right, the dog you Nicole Kidman'd
into the lake.

39:11.150 --> 39:13.000
Virginia Woolf'd, and yes.

39:13.200 --> 39:15.620
- And you still keep his cage?
- To remember him by!

39:15.820 --> 39:17.920
You need to learn to let things go.
It's not healthy.

39:18.120 --> 39:20.590
You mean, you're in a position
to tell me what's healthy?

39:20.790 --> 39:23.150
You hear that? The closet. The closet!

39:34.870 --> 39:35.870
Sandy?

39:38.160 --> 39:40.460
- It's jammed.
- Move, move, move.

39:44.590 --> 39:47.910
- All right, it's obviously locked.
- You can't lock a closet from the inside.

39:48.110 --> 39:51.220
- Says the expert on being in the closet.
- You know what, shut up.

39:52.180 --> 39:53.330
I can let go of things.

39:53.530 --> 39:56.120
I prefer to have the physical evidence
that I was actually here.

39:56.320 --> 39:59.130
Okay, I don't really know if a dog crate
is the best example of that.

39:59.330 --> 40:01.710
- Is everything a joke to you?
- That wasn't a joke.

40:01.910 --> 40:04.730
You ever stop
to consider anybody else's feelings ever?

40:05.440 --> 40:08.010
You wanna talk about
other people's feelings?

40:08.210 --> 40:11.950
Let's talk about how you don't have
the balls to call your own family back.

40:13.620 --> 40:14.950
How do you know that?

40:16.990 --> 40:17.770
Yeah.

40:17.970 --> 40:20.440
She said Patty wants to talk to you,
but you just refuse.

40:20.640 --> 40:23.000
- You wouldn't understand.
- So you're gay.

40:23.630 --> 40:26.030
So they reacted badly. Call them back.

40:26.230 --> 40:31.260
Okay, let me take some advice from a kid
who gives happy endings for a living.

40:32.340 --> 40:35.330
The operative word there is "happy,"
you sad fuck.

40:35.530 --> 40:37.220
- Oh, I'm sad?
- Yeah.

40:37.810 --> 40:41.770
Why don't you examine your own
uneducated existence, you Jezebel!

40:44.020 --> 40:45.440
Jezebel?

40:46.020 --> 40:49.340
When I find out who Jezebel is,
I assume I'm gonna be so mad at you!

40:49.540 --> 40:50.470
Don't follow me!

40:50.670 --> 40:51.890
Hey, you know what?

40:52.090 --> 40:55.270
Your life isn't the only one that changed
when you decided to come out.

40:55.470 --> 40:57.890
I had to be someone I hated for them!

40:58.090 --> 41:00.950
- And that's not their fault.
- And you think I don't know that?

41:01.790 --> 41:04.290
Gary. Gary, where are you going?

41:05.880 --> 41:06.710
Fuck!

41:33.490 --> 41:35.950
I always did what I was supposed to do.

41:38.330 --> 41:39.700
I went to church.

41:43.960 --> 41:45.440
I married young.

41:45.640 --> 41:47.860
I had kids
when I was younger than you are!

41:48.060 --> 41:50.530
Imagine if I had a kid right now.
That'd be so toxic.

41:50.730 --> 41:52.760
I followed all the rules!

41:54.970 --> 41:57.970
I didn't smoke. I drank in moderation.

41:59.930 --> 42:01.870
I cut fat out of my diet in the '90s

42:02.070 --> 42:04.890
and put it back in 2013
when avocados got big!

42:05.520 --> 42:08.100
- Okay.
- My whole life, I've been good!

42:09.940 --> 42:11.520
A good husband.

42:13.860 --> 42:15.030
A good father.

42:15.820 --> 42:18.160
Okay. That was a little bit hard.

42:18.870 --> 42:20.160
A good man!

42:22.240 --> 42:25.120
I didn't enjoy any of it!

42:27.580 --> 42:29.610
Gary, seriously,
you just hit my fucking head.

42:29.810 --> 42:30.840
And you know what?

42:32.000 --> 42:33.740
There is a part of me,

42:33.940 --> 42:37.490
some terrible part of me,
that blames them. But it's my fault!

42:37.690 --> 42:40.550
It's all my fault! It's my fault!

42:43.220 --> 42:44.060
Oh, my God.

42:44.640 --> 42:45.790
It's my fault.

42:45.990 --> 42:48.650
Gary? Gary, Gary!

42:49.270 --> 42:52.930
- Gary. Hey, just breathe. Come on.
- I can't breathe.

42:53.120 --> 42:55.150
Come on. Come on.

42:55.990 --> 42:59.010
- You're okay. I know.
- I can't breathe. I can't breathe.

42:59.210 --> 43:01.070
- Breathe. Breathe.
- I can't breathe.

43:02.280 --> 43:05.950
I can't breathe. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

43:07.540 --> 43:10.540
I'm sorry for calling you Jezebel.

43:11.040 --> 43:13.280
I don't even know who Jezebel is.

43:13.480 --> 43:17.840
But if she's anything like me, we stan.
Is she hot?

43:24.600 --> 43:28.340
You know, I actually envy you, Gary.

43:28.530 --> 43:31.480
- Oh, please.
- No, seriously, I do.

43:32.150 --> 43:35.680
You spent your whole life
lying to everyone about everything,

43:35.880 --> 43:37.860
but you still have a lot to show for it.

43:38.360 --> 43:42.450
You do. You're having a panic attack
on your own damn tennis court!

43:52.170 --> 43:55.380
My dad didn't even acknowledge
when I told him I was gay.

43:58.050 --> 44:00.090
He just said, "Not to me, you're not."

44:01.590 --> 44:05.140
And then he went back to watching TV
like it never happened.

44:08.350 --> 44:13.650
Next day, I left a note on my bed,
drove away, never to return.

44:16.440 --> 44:17.860
What did the note say?

44:20.740 --> 44:22.220
"Fuck you, you bigoted fat fuck.

44:22.420 --> 44:24.740
Your son's a sissy whore faggot
who loves it in the ass."

44:26.080 --> 44:29.700
Or something to that effect.
I can't really remember, but...

44:31.460 --> 44:33.170
He actually meant well, I think.

44:34.000 --> 44:37.630
In his own weird, demented way, he...

44:40.300 --> 44:42.930
He thought that if I was gay,
he had to stop loving me.

44:44.840 --> 44:48.310
So he chose to ignore it
because he wanted to keep loving his son.

44:49.930 --> 44:52.640
But loving someone with conditions
isn't love, it's...

44:55.020 --> 44:55.860
prison.

45:01.610 --> 45:03.240
You're a good man, Cam.

45:08.370 --> 45:12.690
Yeah, based on tonight, I don't think
either one of us is technically that good,

45:12.890 --> 45:14.370
but I appreciate that.

45:19.340 --> 45:23.160
Well, at least it's some relief
knowing there are people out there

45:23.360 --> 45:25.300
being worse than us in the world.

45:27.260 --> 45:28.100
Yeah.

45:29.470 --> 45:30.310
Yeah.

45:32.850 --> 45:34.190
What did you just say?

45:36.190 --> 45:38.110
There are worse people in the world?

45:40.190 --> 45:43.100
Gary. Gary, you're a fucking genius.

45:43.290 --> 45:45.060
- I am?
- Yes! Yes!

45:45.250 --> 45:48.560
We just have
to find somebody worse than us.

45:48.760 --> 45:53.440
Someone that is so insane and deranged,
they'll get us out of this whole mess.

45:53.640 --> 45:56.250
- All we have to do is--
- Get back on Plungr.

45:57.000 --> 45:59.590
The beginning and the end
of all of life's problems.

46:01.630 --> 46:03.950
You have got to work
on your internalised homophobia.

46:04.150 --> 46:05.590
It is seriously shocking.

46:07.180 --> 46:08.800
Let's go, Gary!

46:11.760 --> 46:13.140
"Let's go, Gary."

46:20.360 --> 46:23.030
- What are you doing?
- The dark web, Gary.

46:24.690 --> 46:28.220
- On Looking2Succ's phone?
- You want it traced back to yours?

46:28.420 --> 46:29.370
Hold this.

46:30.490 --> 46:32.690
- Do the facial recognition!
- Jesus Christ.

46:32.890 --> 46:33.660
Do it!

46:39.750 --> 46:41.320
- What happens now?
- I'm doing it, Gary.

46:41.520 --> 46:43.210
- Doing what?
- The dark web.

46:48.010 --> 46:49.910
- Is it hard to do?
- Honey!

46:50.110 --> 46:52.060
Why don't you make us
some coffee or something?

46:55.270 --> 46:57.630
Okay. "Church organist,
can play with or without pipes."

46:57.830 --> 47:00.760
Why would a church organist advertise
on the dark web?

47:00.960 --> 47:03.470
- It's code.
- For what? Sex stuff?

47:03.670 --> 47:05.240
Organ harvesting, duh.

47:07.530 --> 47:10.110
"Circus, Circus, Tigers,
and Bears, Oh, Die."

47:10.910 --> 47:12.020
I don't think I wanna know.

47:12.220 --> 47:14.330
They're either into bestiality
or an arms dealer.

47:15.080 --> 47:17.400
Those are two very different things.

47:17.600 --> 47:19.040
One would think.

47:21.080 --> 47:23.040
Okay, this one says, "Shit on my chest."

47:24.000 --> 47:27.970
Shit. Okay, so shit's brown.
Brown is also the colour of dirt.

47:29.130 --> 47:33.710
Chest, like burying a chest?
Like treasure? Like pirates?

47:33.900 --> 47:36.770
They literally just want someone
to shit on their chest, Gary.

47:38.270 --> 47:41.980
Right? It's like, "Go back to Plungr
where you belong, scat queen."

47:43.440 --> 47:45.510
Gary. Gary, this is our guy.

47:45.710 --> 47:48.890
"Fleshpuppet.
Collecting lifeless lamb chops for play,

47:49.090 --> 47:52.100
with no strings to hold me down,
or attached."

47:52.300 --> 47:55.310
- "Fleshpuppet"?
- Geppetto would never.

47:55.510 --> 47:58.900
"Collecting lifeless lamb chops for play"?

47:59.100 --> 48:01.320
- I don't like the sound of that.
- I do.

48:01.520 --> 48:03.900
Let him take this literal 6'2" lamb chop
off our hands.

48:04.100 --> 48:06.320
What does he want with dead bodies?

48:06.520 --> 48:08.530
Fuck them, eat them,
fuck them and eat them,

48:08.730 --> 48:09.910
fuck them while eating them,

48:10.110 --> 48:12.080
make a skin suit out of them,
sell them for parts,

48:12.280 --> 48:13.330
dress them up like his mom.

48:13.530 --> 48:16.120
The list goes on and on.
Haven't you ever seen a movie before?

48:16.320 --> 48:19.250
Anyway, that's none of our business, okay?
We are just the supplier.

48:19.450 --> 48:22.000
Do not go getting
a moral compass on me again.

48:22.200 --> 48:24.590
We should probably clean ourselves up
before he comes over.

48:24.790 --> 48:26.420
Does that really matter at this point?

48:26.620 --> 48:28.470
Gary, just because you're dying
does not mean

48:28.670 --> 48:30.140
you shouldn't always look your best.

48:30.340 --> 48:33.140
I was not talking about my appearance.
I was talking about the blood.

48:33.340 --> 48:36.770
Oh, my God, Gary, you're right.
We need to give you a makeover!

48:36.970 --> 48:38.910
- Cameron, no.
- Yes!

49:33.760 --> 49:36.550
Ta-da!

49:38.390 --> 49:39.510
Okay.

49:40.560 --> 49:42.830
I look like me, but in blue.

49:43.030 --> 49:43.980
Yeah.

49:44.980 --> 49:48.940
You are a total zaddy, Gary.

49:50.780 --> 49:54.220
Okay. I am a cool...

49:54.420 --> 49:56.950
hot zaddy.

49:58.160 --> 50:01.020
- Can you please not smoke inside?
- It's not smoke, it's vaping.

50:01.220 --> 50:02.150
Just don't do it inside.

50:02.340 --> 50:04.520
We killed a man two hours ago,
but I can't vape inside?

50:04.720 --> 50:06.150
Accidentally killed a man.

50:06.350 --> 50:08.570
Isn't weed supposed to be good for you,
with the cancer?

50:08.770 --> 50:11.710
- I prefer edibles.
- No, too many carbs.

50:12.590 --> 50:13.630
Screw it.

50:15.170 --> 50:17.660
- How do I work it?
- You just press the button.

50:17.860 --> 50:19.620
- Hold it? Press it?
- And inhale.

50:19.820 --> 50:20.760
And then what?

50:22.010 --> 50:23.350
- Fleshpuppet.
- Fleshpuppet.

50:27.940 --> 50:30.310
- Oh, my God.
- Buck.

50:33.860 --> 50:35.450
I'm Gary.

50:36.280 --> 50:38.140
All right, Gary.
You gonna let me in or what?

50:38.340 --> 50:39.370
Oh, yeah.

50:41.410 --> 50:42.240
Cool.

50:46.160 --> 50:49.420
Oh, my God.

50:51.000 --> 50:53.380
Who are you?

50:54.710 --> 50:57.470
Cameron, this is Buck.

50:58.380 --> 50:59.640
Fleshpuppet?

51:01.850 --> 51:02.680
Buck.

51:05.060 --> 51:08.290
- You're, like, hot.
- Yeah, I know. Life ain't fair.

51:08.490 --> 51:10.100
So where's the body?

51:10.690 --> 51:12.880
Quick question before we begin.

51:13.080 --> 51:14.340
- Are you a cop?
- A cop?

51:14.540 --> 51:17.470
- Yes.
- What? No! Wait, are you?

51:17.670 --> 51:18.890
No.

51:19.090 --> 51:21.680
Are you? You kind of look like a cop.

51:21.880 --> 51:25.190
- Oh, thank you.
- That's not a compliment.

51:25.390 --> 51:28.580
No, I'm not a cop at all.
Of course not, I'm not a cop.

51:29.250 --> 51:32.570
Good. 'Cause the dark web's
built on trust.

51:32.770 --> 51:34.250
Stitch that into a pillow.

51:36.460 --> 51:41.750
Where are my manners, Buck?
Can I offer you something to drink?

51:41.940 --> 51:42.750
Y'all got Red Bull?

51:42.950 --> 51:45.390
- Oh, my God. I wish.
- That's the one thing I don't have.

51:46.060 --> 51:47.180
Fuck!

51:47.770 --> 51:50.300
I don't know exactly
how to get this thing started,

51:50.490 --> 51:53.880
so why don't I just tell you a little bit
about how we got into this pickle?

51:54.080 --> 51:56.930
Cameron and I invited over
this gentleman--

51:57.130 --> 51:58.280
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

51:58.860 --> 52:01.430
- The body's a man?
- Yes.

52:01.630 --> 52:02.570
Is that okay?

52:03.910 --> 52:06.980
- Body's a body.
- Oh, my God. Progressive. You're hot.

52:07.180 --> 52:10.570
Okay. So we invited over
this lovely gentleman.

52:10.760 --> 52:13.610
Well, we thought he was lovely.
It turns out that he was really angry--

52:13.810 --> 52:16.710
This closeted fuck came over
and fell out the window, all right?

52:17.300 --> 52:19.490
- That sounds ambiguous.
- No, no.

52:19.690 --> 52:23.120
We assure you that everything
that happened was an accident.

52:23.320 --> 52:25.540
- Where did you kill him?
- Right outside.

52:25.740 --> 52:27.460
- You moved the body?
- It's in the closet.

52:27.660 --> 52:30.710
That makes your cleanup much trickier.
You guys ever seen <i>Gone Girl?</i>

52:30.910 --> 52:32.800
Just the part with Ben Affleck's dick.

52:33.000 --> 52:34.210
- Gary.
- What?

52:34.410 --> 52:37.900
So you guys have never dealt
with a crime scene cleanup before.

52:39.110 --> 52:40.350
- No.
- No. No.

52:40.540 --> 52:41.350
Well...

52:41.550 --> 52:43.360
Lucky for you guys, I come prepared.

52:44.070 --> 52:46.020
All right. A little bit about me.

52:46.220 --> 52:49.020
I'm a Capricorn with Cancer rising.

52:49.220 --> 52:51.060
I love long-distance running,

52:51.260 --> 52:53.690
old science textbooks,
and fucking dead bodies.

52:53.890 --> 52:56.490
Oh, my God. I am such a sucker
for Capricorns, Gary.

52:56.690 --> 52:59.200
Because I'm a Christian,
I'll walk you through the deep clean,

52:59.400 --> 53:01.570
but you're gonna have to do
the legwork yourself.

53:01.770 --> 53:05.550
All I need in return is the body,
no questions asked.

53:06.350 --> 53:11.330
I'm sorry, just the one question
about "fucking dead bodies"?

53:11.530 --> 53:12.590
No questions asked.

53:12.790 --> 53:14.170
Right, but just the one question

53:14.370 --> 53:15.670
- before no questions.
- No, no, no.

53:15.870 --> 53:19.970
That's all, that's all, that's all.
Thank you so much, Mr Fleshpuppet.

53:20.170 --> 53:21.800
- I'm having second thoughts.
- Too late.

53:22.000 --> 53:23.260
What do you care what he does to the body?

53:23.460 --> 53:25.850
- I care.
- Wanna keep it? Put it in the freezer?

53:26.050 --> 53:27.640
- I don't wanna keep it.
- Ut-shay up-yay!

53:27.840 --> 53:29.700
Get me out of here!

53:33.210 --> 53:35.900
Sounds like you got more than one problem
on your hands, boys.

53:36.100 --> 53:39.700
- No, just <i>Sex and the City.</i>
- No, that's <i>Real Housewives of...</i>

53:39.900 --> 53:40.990
<i>- Reno.</i>
<i>- Reno.</i>

53:41.190 --> 53:42.420
Marathon.

53:43.380 --> 53:46.300
- We're Bravoheads.
- Bravo.

53:48.260 --> 53:50.790
All right. Y'all got oxygen-based bleach?

53:50.990 --> 53:52.060
I'll go check.

53:58.360 --> 54:00.270
Banging fucking house, Gary.

54:01.820 --> 54:04.240
- Thank you.
- What's this?

54:07.530 --> 54:09.950
Put that down. Please.

54:11.540 --> 54:13.200
It's just very delicate.

54:21.380 --> 54:22.380
Thank you.

54:29.640 --> 54:32.420
You guys are making
very quick work of this.

54:32.610 --> 54:34.980
I'm impressed.
I might have to hire you guys.

54:36.850 --> 54:40.090
Yeah. Thank you for all of your help.

54:40.290 --> 54:43.610
Yeah. I mean, crime-scene cleaning
can be so exhausting.

54:45.650 --> 54:47.600
You guys mind if I take a smoke break?

54:47.800 --> 54:49.820
- I think we should keep working through--
- Gary.

54:51.080 --> 54:52.890
Fine. Patio's just--

54:53.090 --> 54:55.360
We already vaped inside.
Who cares if he smokes?

54:55.550 --> 54:57.160
Yeah, you're the guest.

55:09.800 --> 55:11.180
Oh, did you want some?

55:12.220 --> 55:14.020
I thought you would never ask.

55:14.890 --> 55:17.920
Oh, sorry.
Gary, did you wanna hit it first?

55:18.120 --> 55:20.520
Oh, yes, for the host with the most.

55:21.360 --> 55:23.110
- Go on.
- No, I'm fine.

55:23.690 --> 55:24.840
Suit yourself, narc.

55:25.040 --> 55:27.610
Would you just excuse us
for one second, please?

55:28.150 --> 55:29.570
You're trying to embarrass me?

55:35.700 --> 55:38.690
- Get in here.
- Crack is where I draw the line.

55:38.890 --> 55:39.820
Gary--

55:40.020 --> 55:43.360
- Oh, my God, this powder room.
- Well...

55:43.560 --> 55:46.410
This was Patty's design.
I would take a more minimalist approach.

55:46.610 --> 55:49.470
Wow, you gave her one room to decorate.
You are an oppressor.

55:54.640 --> 55:57.250
Okay, speaking of,
can you please be cool out there?

55:57.450 --> 55:59.000
There is nothing cool about crack!

55:59.200 --> 56:01.800
Do you know how hard it is
to get crack offered to you guilt-free?

56:02.000 --> 56:03.090
- "Guilt-free"?
- Yeah.

56:03.290 --> 56:05.720
This isn't a fucking
cauliflower-crust pizza, Cameron.

56:05.920 --> 56:06.880
It's a Class A narcotic!

56:07.080 --> 56:10.570
Gary, do you know how much crack
I'd be smoking if I was dying right now?

56:11.200 --> 56:12.930
- A lot.
- Yes, that is correct. A lot.

56:13.130 --> 56:14.600
A lot of fucking crack!

56:14.800 --> 56:16.980
How does that song go?
"Smoke crack like you're dying."

56:17.180 --> 56:19.440
I've never heard it,
but I'm sure that's not how it goes.

56:19.640 --> 56:20.520
Whatever. It's a remix.

56:20.720 --> 56:23.400
We are gonna go out there
and smoke a shit-ton of crack

56:23.600 --> 56:25.400
with the guy who's gonna get
this dead body off our hands.

56:25.600 --> 56:27.110
- And you'll be cool about it!
- Cameron.

56:27.310 --> 56:28.090
- No!
- Yes!

56:33.050 --> 56:35.710
Nicely done, papa.

56:35.900 --> 56:37.670
- Not too much, Cam.
- Get fucked.

56:37.870 --> 56:40.540
We just killed a man and there's
a sweet church lady in the closet.

56:40.740 --> 56:43.300
I knew there was a lady upstairs.
I love you guys.

56:43.500 --> 56:45.090
I'm gonna smoke as much crack as I want,

56:45.290 --> 56:47.880
because it's been a lot of firsts
for me too tonight, Gary.

56:48.080 --> 56:49.280
Where are you going?

56:57.410 --> 56:58.540
Holy shit.

57:00.330 --> 57:01.660
Fuck! I feel...

57:03.580 --> 57:04.750
I feel like...

57:06.130 --> 57:08.150
I remember my first light.

57:08.350 --> 57:12.420
It's like I took a flight,
a pleasure in your mind.

57:13.050 --> 57:14.740
It feels just right.

57:14.940 --> 57:17.010
Whoa! Did that just rhyme?

57:18.470 --> 57:21.270
- Did you hear that?
- No, I didn't hear anything.

57:21.980 --> 57:25.130
It's your subconscious, Gary.
Guilt's creeping in.

57:25.330 --> 57:27.310
Just ignore it. That's what I do.

57:32.280 --> 57:33.890
Did you hear that?

57:34.090 --> 57:36.990
That sound in your head,
it's like a popping sound.

57:43.370 --> 57:46.730
Totally normal.
It's your mind expanding, my friends.

57:46.930 --> 57:50.170
Just ignore the demons
and focus on the feeling.

57:51.260 --> 57:52.260
The feeling.

57:53.300 --> 57:54.590
I feel...

58:01.720 --> 58:02.770
<i>I feel...</i>

58:05.520 --> 58:06.670
Good.

58:06.870 --> 58:12.590
<i>Where have</i>
<i>Where have you been all my life and</i>

58:12.790 --> 58:15.390
<i>Boy don't stop taking me</i>
<i>High</i>

58:15.590 --> 58:19.390
<i>Midnight in Brooklyn</i>
<i>You leaned in first</i>

58:19.590 --> 58:23.190
<i>I wasn't looking</i>
<i>But there you were</i>

58:23.390 --> 58:26.900
<i>My fallen angel</i>
<i>Calling my name, calling my name</i>

58:27.100 --> 58:31.110
<i>My fallen angel</i>
<i>Calling my name, calling my name</i>

58:31.310 --> 58:34.820
<i>Lost in a dark room</i>
<i>Walking on air</i>

58:35.020 --> 58:38.540
<i>Don't have to see you</i>
<i>To know you're there</i>

58:38.740 --> 58:42.580
<i>- Die for the way you're</i>
<i>- Dancing on me, dancing on me</i>

58:42.780 --> 58:46.230
<i>- Die for the way you're</i>
<i>- Dancing on me, dancing on me</i>

58:47.350 --> 58:50.420
<i>The way you make me feel</i>
<i>I swear you take me higher</i>

58:50.620 --> 58:54.720
<i>Yes, I'm your every desire</i>
<i>Take me home, but take me higher</i>

58:54.920 --> 58:58.100
<i>The way you make me feel</i>
<i>I swear you take me higher</i>

58:58.300 --> 59:02.480
<i>Yes, I'm your every desire</i>
<i>When you take me higher</i>

59:02.680 --> 59:07.980
<i>Where have</i>
<i>Where have you been all my life and</i>

59:08.180 --> 59:11.030
<i>Boy don't stop taking me</i>
<i>High</i>

59:11.230 --> 59:14.780
<i>Higher than I've ever been</i>
<i>High</i>

59:14.980 --> 59:17.090
<i>Higher than the heavens is</i>

59:18.130 --> 59:23.710
<i>No lie</i>
<i>No lie, your hands keep my hands tied</i>

59:23.910 --> 59:26.170
<i>Boy don't stop taking me</i>
<i>High</i>

59:26.370 --> 59:30.000
<i>Higher than I've ever been</i>
<i>High</i>

59:30.200 --> 59:33.010
<i>Higher than the heavens is</i>

59:33.210 --> 59:36.260
<i>Jump into diamonds</i>
<i>A thousand eyes</i>

59:36.460 --> 59:40.930
<i>Watching the silence</i>
<i>As we get higher</i>

59:41.130 --> 59:42.660
Is this what it's like?

59:44.620 --> 59:45.620
What's like?

59:52.420 --> 59:55.590
Yeah, this is what it's like.

59:59.760 --> 01:00:00.760
Come on.

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:38.130
Crack is so bad for you.

01:01:38.330 --> 01:01:40.030
Really, really bad.

01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:44.450
Very, very, very bad.

01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:46.700
For sure.

01:01:50.410 --> 01:01:52.910
You guys doing anything for the Rapture?

01:01:54.750 --> 01:01:56.920
- What?
- The Rapture.

01:01:57.580 --> 01:02:00.130
Doomsday. End times.

01:02:01.550 --> 01:02:04.620
I just finished building my bomb shelter.

01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:06.760
I got a full kit and everything.

01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:09.220
I put all my regalia in there.

01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:12.310
You guys are welcome to join me.

01:02:13.390 --> 01:02:14.770
Thanks, Fleshpuppet.

01:02:15.390 --> 01:02:16.900
What about you, narc?

01:02:20.230 --> 01:02:22.650
I don't think I'll be seeing
the end of the world.

01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:25.780
- Don't be such a pessimist.
- Hey.

01:02:26.320 --> 01:02:27.410
He's dying.

01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:32.490
- That's hot.
- Keep it in your pants.

01:02:33.830 --> 01:02:34.900
How much longer you got?

01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:37.120
Okay, that's so rude.
You don't ask people that.

01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:42.170
Wait, how much longer do you got?

01:02:43.590 --> 01:02:44.590
A month.

01:02:46.050 --> 01:02:48.430
- A month?
- Give or take.

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:55.640
I'm gonna...

01:02:56.350 --> 01:02:57.630
I'm gonna let you guys

01:02:57.830 --> 01:03:00.880
<i>Terms of Endearment</i> it up together
for a little bit.

01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:04.440
Gary, I'm gonna go jack off
in one of your many bathrooms.

01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:09.280
That's okay. I think...

01:03:11.030 --> 01:03:12.910
we should all go inside now.

01:03:29.050 --> 01:03:30.680
Gary, I had no idea.

01:03:32.930 --> 01:03:34.430
I didn't tell you, so...

01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:36.520
I wish you would have.

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:39.440
Cameron.

01:03:44.150 --> 01:03:45.610
Where's my egg?

01:03:50.070 --> 01:03:53.780
Well, gentlemen, that was fun.

01:03:54.370 --> 01:03:56.770
But I should probably collect my corpse

01:03:56.970 --> 01:03:59.230
and skedaddle
before the rest of the world wakes up.

01:03:59.430 --> 01:04:02.780
You know, can't be seen
dragging a dead body around

01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:04.590
in broad daylight, now, can we?

01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:08.880
Gary. Gary!

01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:12.540
- Give me my egg.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

01:04:12.740 --> 01:04:15.560
- Did you put it down your pants?
- No, that's my dick.

01:04:16.310 --> 01:04:17.960
We both saw your dick in the lake, Buck,

01:04:18.160 --> 01:04:20.420
and we can all agree
it doesn't look anything like that.

01:04:20.620 --> 01:04:23.420
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Let's be a little bit
empathetic to shrinkage, boys.

01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:25.550
That is my great-great-grandmother's
fucking egg,

01:04:25.750 --> 01:04:27.320
and you better fucking give it back.

01:04:31.030 --> 01:04:32.160
Or what?

01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:37.370
Boys. Boys.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.910
Come on, there's a better way
we can work this out, right?

01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:42.580
Right?

01:04:43.580 --> 01:04:46.610
All right. You're right. You're right.

01:04:46.810 --> 01:04:49.660
You caught me. Let's make a deal, okay?

01:04:49.860 --> 01:04:53.050
I will give you
your great-grandmother's egg back...

01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:56.680
if I can have your body after you go.

01:04:58.930 --> 01:05:02.090
Oh, my God. You sick fuck!

01:05:02.290 --> 01:05:03.550
Okay, okay. You wanna trade?

01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:05.630
Give him his egg back
and you can get your body.

01:05:05.830 --> 01:05:08.610
- Oh, that body's already mine.
- Well, that egg is fucking mine!

01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:12.510
Worms are gonna be eating
your dead gay ass in a month.

01:05:12.710 --> 01:05:13.970
What does it even matter?

01:05:14.170 --> 01:05:14.950
Jesus.

01:05:16.370 --> 01:05:17.200
Yeah.

01:05:19.370 --> 01:05:21.730
What does anything fucking matter?

01:05:21.930 --> 01:05:23.020
Yeah.

01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:25.320
What, did I say something insensitive?
Why is he--?

01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:29.800
- Okay, you know what? Fuck you.
- It's cute you care about your friend.

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:32.050
All right, fine. What do you want?

01:05:33.380 --> 01:05:35.950
- I get the dead guy's truck.
- Why do you want a truck?

01:05:36.150 --> 01:05:38.120
I Uber'd here.
I lost everything in the divorce.

01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:40.890
All right. Whatever. Sure. Deal.

01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:47.310
My dick isn't tiny.

01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:49.720
No, I need you to verbalise it for me.

01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:51.150
- Tell me.
- Seriously?

01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:54.010
- Okay, your dick is not tiny.
- Thank you.

01:05:54.210 --> 01:05:58.060
Okay. All right.
Now let's go get you your dead body.

01:05:58.260 --> 01:05:59.830
Finally. Jesus.

01:06:00.740 --> 01:06:03.980
So he has a habit of falling out,
so just keep that in mind.

01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:06.540
- This ain't my first rodeo, pal.
- Hey.

01:06:07.790 --> 01:06:11.070
- I don't want Buck to have the body.
- Gary, it's practically rush hour.

01:06:11.270 --> 01:06:13.470
No, we cannot give the body to this...

01:06:14.220 --> 01:06:16.340
twisted, dark-sided psychopath.

01:06:16.930 --> 01:06:20.410
Okay, I'm starting to feel judged,
and I'm about to get mad.

01:06:20.610 --> 01:06:22.880
No, no, don't get mad.
We're gonna give you your body.

01:06:23.070 --> 01:06:25.880
- He deserves a proper burial.
- Jesus Christ, I'm not an animal.

01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:28.420
I'm gonna bury him
after I'm done fucking him. Jesus.

01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:30.670
- Open the door and give me the body.
- Don't open the door.

01:06:30.870 --> 01:06:32.640
Open the door. Open the door.

01:06:32.830 --> 01:06:35.010
- Do not open the door.
- Shut up! Open the fucking door!

01:06:35.210 --> 01:06:37.110
- I'm opening the fucking door!
- Thank you.

01:06:39.950 --> 01:06:41.740
- What the fuck?
- What the fuck?

01:06:44.250 --> 01:06:45.370
Shit.

01:06:55.130 --> 01:06:58.580
What the fuck?
He's still alive, you fucking idiots.

01:06:58.780 --> 01:06:59.970
We're in the clear!

01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:02.330
- I'm not gay!
- Babe, what?

01:07:02.530 --> 01:07:04.500
I'm not gay! I'm not gay!

01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:07.920
Now, sir, you've been seriously injured.

01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:11.420
I'm afraid that if you don't get
medical attention, you could die.

01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:15.010
I can't have my family knowing I was here.
Don't call the cops, please.

01:07:15.210 --> 01:07:17.970
Please, please, just let me go.

01:07:18.170 --> 01:07:21.660
I swear to God I'll never suck cock again.

01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:25.450
You'd rather die
than have your family know you're gay?

01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:28.540
I'm not fucking gay!

01:07:36.920 --> 01:07:38.840
I'm not...

01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:42.510
gay.

01:07:49.350 --> 01:07:50.520
Got him.

01:07:54.320 --> 01:07:57.930
Oh, my God.
You fucking murdered him again!

01:07:58.130 --> 01:08:01.110
- Hey. It's my body.
- He wasn't dead!

01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:04.030
He's dead now.

01:08:08.330 --> 01:08:11.540
You know, I'm a little upset, guys.

01:08:12.130 --> 01:08:13.750
Seeing you try to help him.

01:08:15.340 --> 01:08:16.710
Thought we had a deal.

01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:18.590
Put him down.

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:26.140
What are you gonna do about it?

01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:27.930
Gary!

01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:34.560
Gary! Gary!

01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:38.740
I told you not to make me angry, narc!

01:08:41.570 --> 01:08:42.910
Get off of him!

01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:52.620
I can't wait to fuck the death into you.

01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:57.840
That's so gross.

01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:23.110
That was so hot.

01:09:25.200 --> 01:09:26.030
Yeah.

01:09:28.990 --> 01:09:30.000
I know.

01:09:37.250 --> 01:09:39.210
Where did you get a scooter from?

01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:41.590
It's my sons'.

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:51.180
I know you said never
to save your life again, but...

01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:55.100
I'll allow it this once.

01:10:00.230 --> 01:10:02.440
Remember when we only had one body
to worry about?

01:10:03.990 --> 01:10:07.020
Get in. I know a place.

01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:08.450
Now you tell me.

01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:34.560
Ever think about
where you wanna be buried?

01:10:37.270 --> 01:10:40.150
Sorry. That's so fucked up to ask.

01:10:42.030 --> 01:10:44.430
They're probably just gonna give me
some kind of religious burial,

01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:45.900
no matter what I want.

01:10:46.950 --> 01:10:48.280
So who cares?

01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:54.290
I care.

01:11:00.290 --> 01:11:03.340
I don't know. Just Nicole Kidman me
in a lake with my dog.

01:11:06.510 --> 01:11:07.800
That's a good choice.

01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:11.430
Oscar-worthy.

01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:05.190
- Sandy?
- Oh, hi.

01:12:05.820 --> 01:12:07.510
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:12:07.710 --> 01:12:09.990
Oh, my. Have you been gardening?

01:12:14.490 --> 01:12:18.250
- A little bit.
- Good for you!

01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:22.960
Look at me,
just making myself right at home.

01:12:23.590 --> 01:12:27.010
Listen, about last night...

01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:30.680
I'm so embarrassed.

01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:33.050
I don't remember a thing.

01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:35.100
You don't?

01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:39.980
Oh, Sandy, you did seem...

01:12:40.940 --> 01:12:42.900
very inebriated.

01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:44.510
Oh, Gary.

01:12:44.710 --> 01:12:45.800
It was right as we--

01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:48.640
I was about to watch <i>Sex and the City 2,</i>

01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:50.990
and something about...

01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:54.680
- Cynthia...
- Nixon.

01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:57.740
Nixon really set you off.

01:12:58.790 --> 01:13:00.690
She really does bother me.

01:13:00.890 --> 01:13:04.250
- But not as much as Charlotte.
- Exactly.

01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:06.650
You were threatening self-harm,

01:13:06.850 --> 01:13:08.950
and then you locked yourself in the closet

01:13:09.150 --> 01:13:12.090
before we-- I could help you.

01:13:13.550 --> 01:13:14.870
Well, I'll tell you one thing,

01:13:15.070 --> 01:13:17.960
not the first time
I've woken up in a closet.

01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:21.630
My husband, God rest his soul,

01:13:21.830 --> 01:13:25.800
he practically had to tie me to the bed
to keep me from jumping off the balcony

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.090
in the middle of <i>Beaches,</i>
that Bette Midler trauma.

01:13:29.290 --> 01:13:30.860
I'm sure that's terrible.

01:13:42.710 --> 01:13:44.960
I'm so lonely.

01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:50.420
Aren't you lonely too, Gary?

01:13:52.220 --> 01:13:53.050
Yeah.

01:13:59.720 --> 01:14:02.930
Well, I better be getting along.

01:14:03.730 --> 01:14:06.190
Gotta hit the road.

01:14:08.150 --> 01:14:09.270
Stat.

01:14:10.730 --> 01:14:12.030
Okay.

01:14:19.490 --> 01:14:23.660
You're a good man, Gary.

01:14:28.330 --> 01:14:30.500
I don't care what anyone else says.

01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:33.800
Okay.

01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:38.330
- Okay, bye. Bye. Bye.
- Bye. Bye.

01:14:38.530 --> 01:14:40.370
- Bye! Bye-bye!
- Bye.

01:14:40.570 --> 01:14:41.810
Bye-bye!

01:14:47.350 --> 01:14:49.270
Oh, my God. Gary, you nailed that.

01:14:50.190 --> 01:14:51.800
- Did I?
- Yes, bitch.

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:55.640
The <i>Sex and the City 2</i> of it all?
You have really come into your own.

01:14:55.840 --> 01:14:57.010
Am I officially gay now?

01:14:57.210 --> 01:14:59.980
Being gay was inside of you all along,
Scarecrow.

01:15:00.170 --> 01:15:03.560
This is where I make a joke about all
the other gay things I want inside of me.

01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:06.920
The student becomes the teacher. Namaste.

01:15:18.430 --> 01:15:20.550
You wanna know something fucked up?

01:15:22.430 --> 01:15:24.140
Ever since I was a little girl.

01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:33.320
Last night might be the most alive
I've ever felt.

01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:37.900
That is so fucked up.

01:15:41.820 --> 01:15:43.830
I'm really glad I met you.

01:15:45.830 --> 01:15:48.250
Even if multiple people are dead
because of it.

01:15:50.540 --> 01:15:53.040
That's the nicest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

01:15:57.840 --> 01:15:58.970
Before I forget...

01:16:04.430 --> 01:16:05.930
I put it in my pants.

01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:16.730
You should keep it.

01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:22.950
Something to remember me by.

01:16:25.330 --> 01:16:26.740
It's yours, Gary.

01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:49.670
You don't have to kiss me, Cameron.
Really.

01:16:49.870 --> 01:16:51.230
I'm not gonna kiss you.

01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:55.520
You're gonna kiss me, Gary.

01:17:52.370 --> 01:17:55.170
Are you sure that was your first time?
I just fit right in there.

01:17:56.920 --> 01:17:57.920
Oh, God.

01:18:03.550 --> 01:18:05.930
Gary, I really think
you should call your sons.

01:18:07.970 --> 01:18:11.670
I don't love the timing of that statement.

01:18:11.870 --> 01:18:14.270
Yeah. No, I get that, but...

01:18:15.270 --> 01:18:16.270
you should.

01:18:18.770 --> 01:18:20.440
I wouldn't know what to say.

01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:24.900
After all this time.

01:18:28.530 --> 01:18:29.580
You do, though.

01:18:44.510 --> 01:18:47.760
- Thanks for the clothes.
- Yeah, they look better on you.

01:18:52.220 --> 01:18:53.220
Gary, I just...

01:18:55.020 --> 01:18:56.190
I wanna say...

01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:00.650
you're hot.

01:19:01.900 --> 01:19:04.740
And in case I forget to tell you later...

01:19:06.070 --> 01:19:07.610
I had a really good time tonight.

01:19:11.330 --> 01:19:12.370
<i>Pretty Woman.</i>

01:19:12.950 --> 01:19:13.790
Yeah.

01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:23.090
Well, if you...

01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:26.760
You wanna call me or get together again...

01:19:27.930 --> 01:19:28.930
Cameron.

01:19:35.770 --> 01:19:36.770
Thank you.

01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:48.150
Okay.

01:20:33.320 --> 01:20:34.990
"Dear friends and family...

01:20:36.290 --> 01:20:38.190
After recently coming out as a gay man,

01:20:38.390 --> 01:20:42.710
Gary O'Connell died on Sunday, May 31st,
peacefully in his home."

01:20:45.130 --> 01:20:46.590
Gary.

01:20:47.170 --> 01:20:50.490
"Memorial service will be held
at Mary Magdalene Church and Cemetery,

01:20:50.690 --> 01:20:51.410
June 7th.

01:20:51.610 --> 01:20:55.010
Donations in his memory
may be made to the church."

01:20:57.180 --> 01:20:58.600
What the fuck?

01:21:11.530 --> 01:21:14.680
...wondering what if it's been me and--

01:21:14.880 --> 01:21:17.080
- I don't know, I just couldn't get over--
- Bullshit.

01:21:19.250 --> 01:21:20.580
Hi, Patty.

01:21:21.290 --> 01:21:23.610
I got your fucking invitation,
you Hallmark hussy.

01:21:23.810 --> 01:21:27.700
- That card was beautiful, tasteful--
- And Gary would have hated it.

01:21:27.900 --> 01:21:29.820
- Listen, man. You got--
- No, no, no. That's okay.

01:21:30.020 --> 01:21:31.720
I'm here 'cause I cared a lot about Gary.

01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:33.510
A lot.

01:21:34.300 --> 01:21:36.160
And I got to know the real him.

01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:39.170
The him that none of you ever got to see.

01:21:39.370 --> 01:21:40.600
And that Gary...

01:21:42.270 --> 01:21:43.850
that Gary would have hated this.

01:21:44.440 --> 01:21:45.520
And you know that.

01:21:47.190 --> 01:21:48.480
Don't you, Patty?

01:21:52.950 --> 01:21:55.780
- Are you finished?
- I don't know. Am I finished?

01:22:00.700 --> 01:22:03.910
I know you think you had a good reason
for coming...

01:22:04.830 --> 01:22:06.330
but let me tell you this.

01:22:07.380 --> 01:22:08.920
We all made our choices.

01:22:09.710 --> 01:22:12.450
My husband made his choice.

01:22:12.650 --> 01:22:15.370
And was it the right one for him
at the time? Maybe.

01:22:15.570 --> 01:22:17.790
But the truth is, if I had known,

01:22:17.990 --> 01:22:20.920
maybe my choices would have
been different.

01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:22.220
Because this was...

01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:26.770
never about me standing in the way
of what Gary wanted.

01:22:27.900 --> 01:22:29.320
This was about him.

01:22:30.820 --> 01:22:33.760
And the both of us wasted
so much of our lives

01:22:33.960 --> 01:22:36.640
trying to be what the other person wanted.

01:22:36.840 --> 01:22:39.780
So much trying, so many years.

01:22:40.490 --> 01:22:42.580
And we never did get to be who we wanted.

01:22:43.250 --> 01:22:45.150
Neither one of us. Ever.

01:22:45.350 --> 01:22:46.290
Until the end.

01:22:47.250 --> 01:22:50.130
He wasn't sorry. He was angry.

01:22:51.050 --> 01:22:53.010
And so I got angry too.

01:22:53.630 --> 01:22:56.760
And we both chose to sit in that anger
for a long time.

01:22:57.390 --> 01:22:58.540
Too long.

01:22:58.740 --> 01:23:01.160
But then we made another choice.

01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:03.540
And we had the courage
to put all that aside.

01:23:03.740 --> 01:23:07.520
And that is the man
that I finally got to know.

01:23:09.060 --> 01:23:10.010
So God help me,

01:23:10.210 --> 01:23:13.570
don't you dare stand there
and tell me that I didn't know who he was.

01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:17.200
I'm sorry.

01:23:19.410 --> 01:23:20.410
Good.

01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:26.080
Father, I'm so sorry about that.

01:23:36.920 --> 01:23:40.240
Hey. What the hell did you think
you were doing in there?

01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:42.120
Look, I'm not here to cause any trouble.

01:23:42.320 --> 01:23:45.120
Well, you did call my mom
a "Hallmark hussy."

01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:48.590
Yeah, words just kind of fall
out of my mouth sometimes and...

01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:49.500
I don't know.

01:23:49.700 --> 01:23:52.060
- Right. Understood.
- Yeah.

01:23:52.650 --> 01:23:56.240
My father reached out,
and he told us that he met a guy...

01:23:57.030 --> 01:24:00.390
and that that guy said that
he should call his family.

01:24:00.590 --> 01:24:03.180
And I just wanted to say, because of you,

01:24:03.380 --> 01:24:05.120
we got our dad back...

01:24:06.250 --> 01:24:07.770
for a little while longer.

01:24:07.970 --> 01:24:08.910
That's...

01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:11.130
I'm glad.

01:24:12.380 --> 01:24:13.670
And then this.

01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:18.050
He wanted to make sure I gave it to you.

01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:23.970
He said you'd know what to do with it.

01:24:27.560 --> 01:24:28.640
I do.

01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:30.390
Cool.

01:24:48.330 --> 01:24:49.410
Could I just...?

01:25:13.980 --> 01:25:16.020
Can I just get a moment with him?

01:25:16.860 --> 01:25:18.400
Can you turn around, please?

01:25:19.440 --> 01:25:20.280
Sorry.

01:25:26.080 --> 01:25:27.080
Thank you.

01:25:37.750 --> 01:25:38.750
Oh, Gary...

01:25:40.670 --> 01:25:41.760
my lover...

01:25:43.340 --> 01:25:44.340
my friend...

01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:49.370
the day I penetrated your virgin hole...

01:25:49.570 --> 01:25:50.710
Oh, my God.

01:25:50.910 --> 01:25:52.430
...was the best day of my life!

01:25:53.310 --> 01:25:59.220
And we may not be leaving this Earth
at the same time,

01:25:59.420 --> 01:26:02.950
but at least we came together!

01:26:09.700 --> 01:26:11.620
What the fuck are you doing?

01:26:13.540 --> 01:26:15.040
Fuck. Fuck.

01:26:21.590 --> 01:26:23.300
Let's do some gay shit, Gary.

01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:29.560
Stop! Yo! Where are you going?

01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:31.640
Are you--?

01:27:30.740 --> 01:27:31.950
He's coming for you, Duke.

01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:11.120
Fuck.

01:28:15.700 --> 01:28:16.790
Fuck!
