01:26.837 --> 01:29.837
You may now kiss the bride.

01:30.962 --> 01:33.630
From now on,
he'll take care of you...

01:33.713 --> 01:35.672
and you'll take care of him.

01:35.713 --> 01:38.089
He'll make you
big baloney sandwiches...

01:38.172 --> 01:41.005
and you'll buy him new socks
and a white briefcase.

01:41.047 --> 01:44.547
And you'll live happily ever after.

01:44.631 --> 01:47.172
You're the luckiest girl
in the world, Barbie.

01:47.255 --> 01:49.673
The luckiest girl in the world.

01:50.756 --> 01:53.006
You are the luckiest girl
in the world.

01:53.090 --> 01:56.757
When I did Whitney Houston's wedding,
she was even more nervous than you.

01:56.799 --> 01:59.215
And you look ten times better
than she did.

01:59.298 --> 02:01.674
No, I don't.

02:01.757 --> 02:04.340
This isn't gonna work.

02:04.423 --> 02:05.966
I'm fat!

02:06.048 --> 02:07.633
And I'm gonna marry
the wrong guy.

02:07.716 --> 02:09.174
Look at me.

02:09.216 --> 02:11.967
You are exquisite.

02:12.049 --> 02:14.383
You're timeless.

02:14.424 --> 02:17.675
You're the envy of your
future sister-in-law Janice...

02:17.758 --> 02:21.175
whom I over heard say at the last
gown fitting, "Look at those thighs.

02:21.258 --> 02:23.968
I'd kill for Tracy's thighs."

02:26.592 --> 02:28.759
But you have more
than great thighs.

02:30.300 --> 02:33.384
You have the love
of a man named Tom.

02:33.467 --> 02:36.553
A man who, when he walked into
rehearsal dinner the other day...

02:36.637 --> 02:40.804
said, "I can't believe
she picked me.

02:40.845 --> 02:44.887
I can't believe I'm marrying the
most beautiful woman I've ever seen."

02:49.221 --> 02:52.638
That tells me that this marriage
of yours is not only gonna work...

02:54.097 --> 02:56.222
it's gonna last forever.

02:58.554 --> 02:59.972
Thank you.

03:03.972 --> 03:05.931
Oh, Mom, come here.

03:08.681 --> 03:10.223
Excuse me.

03:10.306 --> 03:12.931
Hey, what are you doing?

03:14.306 --> 03:15.722
Thank you!

03:16.889 --> 03:20.765
Keep to areas A, B and E. I don't want
any interference with the video team.

03:27.015 --> 03:30.598
I know who you're looking for.
They're right downstairs.

03:37.433 --> 03:39.433
- Father, where are you going?
- Nature calls.

03:39.517 --> 03:41.808
You must call back later.
We're about to start.

03:41.849 --> 03:43.808
Let's go. Inside.

03:47.016 --> 03:48.433
Good morning.

04:02.560 --> 04:05.644
Penny, stop firting.
We're going in one.

04:10.477 --> 04:14.227
Penny, go to M-1 2.
We have a darkTower choking the AV.

04:17.226 --> 04:19.810
Hi, ma'am. You're in
the preferred seating list.

04:19.894 --> 04:22.436
- If you'll just follow me.
- Bye.

04:22.520 --> 04:24.478
There we go.

04:24.562 --> 04:27.395
Enjoy the wedding
from way back here.

04:27.478 --> 04:29.144
darkTower demolished.

04:29.228 --> 04:32.228
All right.
Places, everyone.

04:32.311 --> 04:35.104
Todd, cut the fill lights.

04:35.187 --> 04:37.312
Maestro, on three.

04:37.396 --> 04:39.855
Excuse me, Mary. We can't find
the father of the bride.

04:39.938 --> 04:42.980
That's okay. I got it.
Penny, send over the FOB.

04:43.063 --> 04:45.771
I did, 15 minutes ago.

04:47.604 --> 04:50.355
Cover me up north.
The FOB is MIA.

04:52.772 --> 04:55.689
Oh, no, no, no.
Count to 1 00 and start again, okay?

05:14.232 --> 05:17.398
Father, you're gonna
have to hold it.

05:17.481 --> 05:18.898
Good.

05:28.150 --> 05:31.400
Hey, guys, we're on.
Come on, put your jackets on.

05:33.066 --> 05:36.151
Hickory, dickory, dock.
The mouse ran up the clock.

05:36.234 --> 05:38.692
I have a 20 on the FOB.

05:42.151 --> 05:45.151
My little girl's
getting married today.

05:45.234 --> 05:48.984
I remember her graduation
from nursery school...

05:49.067 --> 05:52.527
when she was a little girl.

05:52.609 --> 05:54.527
I remember...

05:54.610 --> 05:57.402
like it was yesterday.

05:59.110 --> 06:01.152
- Who are you?
- I'm the wedding planner.

06:20.696 --> 06:22.654
Look, there's the wedding planner.

06:40.572 --> 06:43.029
She must lead
such a romantic life.

08:12.705 --> 08:15.039
"Earwax."

08:15.122 --> 08:18.373
"X" on a double letter.
"A" on a triple word.

08:18.457 --> 08:20.290
Seventy-two points.

08:20.373 --> 08:22.956
No, I challenge you.
"Earwax" is two words.

08:23.040 --> 08:24.415
- It's one.
- You're bluffing.

08:24.498 --> 08:27.040
"Munch." Sixteen points.

08:27.123 --> 08:28.415
Sixteen.

08:28.498 --> 08:32.289
Maria, I know I'm a pain in the neck.
I just want you to be happy.

08:32.373 --> 08:36.499
I'm gonna say something that you
may be a little resistant to...

08:36.582 --> 08:39.207
but sometimes a father
has to take action.

08:39.291 --> 08:41.166
What are you talking about?

08:41.207 --> 08:44.999
I found you a man
who has agreed to marry you.

08:45.041 --> 08:47.166
Oh, my God!

08:47.207 --> 08:49.208
If her mother was alive...

08:49.292 --> 08:51.667
and she heard that,
she'd wish she was dead.

08:51.751 --> 08:54.500
"Shaft." Twenty-two points.

08:54.584 --> 08:57.834
Anyway, you know him.
Remember Massimo?

08:57.917 --> 08:59.292
No. Who?

08:59.375 --> 09:03.585
Massimo Lenzetta, the little boy you
played with the summer we were in Italy?

09:03.668 --> 09:06.752
- The kid who ate mud?
- That's the one!

09:07.710 --> 09:11.960
I bumped into him on New Arrivals Night
at the Sicilian Association.

09:13.002 --> 09:15.793
Why, this is the most
wonderful day of my life!

09:15.877 --> 09:18.878
A man of my very own!

09:18.961 --> 09:22.003
- You must bring me to him at once.
- No need.

09:23.127 --> 09:24.669
- He's here?
- Yeah.

09:24.753 --> 09:27.502
- He's here? He's here?
- Massimo.

09:30.544 --> 09:33.004
- No, he didn't.
- Oh, my God.

09:36.420 --> 09:38.337
Oh, my God.

09:42.337 --> 09:44.670
You remember Massimo?

09:45.712 --> 09:48.796
That mud did him good.

09:49.630 --> 09:52.255
The last time I see you,
you were scrawny and ugly...

09:52.338 --> 09:54.504
and your head was too big
for your body.

09:55.588 --> 09:57.172
How nice. Thank you.

09:57.255 --> 09:58.546
You're welcome.

10:00.339 --> 10:02.589
I look forward
to our life together.

10:02.672 --> 10:06.131
I want three sons
and a garden of tomatoes.

10:06.215 --> 10:07.381
Okay then.

10:07.464 --> 10:09.256
Tomatoes? Tomatoes?

10:10.672 --> 10:12.089
Maria, wait.

10:28.466 --> 10:30.049
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

10:30.132 --> 10:32.966
The paper, and I'm gonna take
that Yahoo too.

10:33.050 --> 10:35.217
4.50.

10:35.258 --> 10:36.592
- Keep it.
- Thanks.

10:36.633 --> 10:38.592
- See ya.
- Bye.

10:47.717 --> 10:50.259
- You look all excited.
- I am.

10:53.009 --> 10:55.676
- Mary, I need...
- Can you take it, please?

11:01.219 --> 11:02.677
Francine donolly.

11:02.719 --> 11:06.385
Her family sold gourmet sausages
out of the working-class kitchen.

11:06.469 --> 11:08.927
- Yeah?
- Now today, five years later...

11:09.010 --> 11:12.844
they're one of the biggest Internet
food specialty companies in America.

11:12.927 --> 11:16.553
Pierre, I love you, but if you use
another carnation in my bouquet...

11:16.637 --> 11:18.303
I will deport you.

11:18.386 --> 11:20.136
- Thank you so much.
- Geri.

11:21.345 --> 11:23.969
They put her wedding announcement
in the society pages. Why?

11:24.011 --> 11:26.970
Because they want their new money
to be taken very seriously.

11:27.011 --> 11:30.345
Sheila! Book the Gazebo Package
for the Belettis, okay?

11:30.386 --> 11:31.971
Take this ugly fower.

11:32.054 --> 11:34.763
Call davis and tell him we need
a rush order on the chuppa rental.

11:34.846 --> 11:36.262
Thank you.

11:37.429 --> 11:39.805
- What the hell is this?
- Sunless tanning cream.

11:39.888 --> 11:42.262
Wedding's tomorrow.
You do the math.

11:42.304 --> 11:46.597
Stop crying. Quarter cup oflemonjuice,
half a cup of salt and a loofah sponge.

11:46.639 --> 11:49.098
- Really?
- Scrub, scrub, scrub. Okay?

11:49.139 --> 11:52.098
Look, they see this
as their ticket into the club.

11:52.139 --> 11:55.139
They wanna make it a social event,
the party everybody talks about.

11:56.806 --> 11:58.806
Oh, thank you, Sheila.

11:58.889 --> 12:02.681
I already made contact. They're coming
to the Copeland wedding to see my work.

12:04.598 --> 12:06.556
I'm gonna nail this account.

12:06.598 --> 12:09.389
We'll be in every major
bridal magazine in the country.

12:09.473 --> 12:12.057
- It'll be our biggest event ever.
- Good.

12:12.890 --> 12:15.140
When I pull it off,
you're gonna make me a partner.

12:16.390 --> 12:18.308
- A partner?
- Yes.

12:19.557 --> 12:20.849
A partner.

12:20.933 --> 12:24.808
Okay, you are fantastic.

12:24.849 --> 12:26.849
Really, you're incredible.

12:26.933 --> 12:29.641
Very good work,
but let me tell you something.

12:29.682 --> 12:31.850
I built this business
on my back.

12:31.934 --> 12:34.017
I sweat, I toiled.

12:34.101 --> 12:38.059
I did things a little, innocent wedding
planner shouldn't even hear about.

12:38.101 --> 12:39.683
I won't even say it.

12:39.725 --> 12:43.767
I made the big plans, okay?
I made the sacrifices.

12:43.850 --> 12:46.352
You also never made any money.

12:46.435 --> 12:47.560
Wow!

12:47.643 --> 12:50.227
Until I came along.

12:50.268 --> 12:52.768
Look, I've been here
for five years, Geri.

12:52.851 --> 12:55.726
I bring in more revenue than all of
your other wedding planners combined.

12:55.810 --> 12:57.560
- That's great.
- Times five!

12:59.810 --> 13:01.896
You need me.

13:01.979 --> 13:04.438
You know you need me.

13:04.522 --> 13:07.271
- I know you know that you need me.
- I don't know that.

13:07.355 --> 13:09.896
You know, maybe I should
just start my own company.

13:10.729 --> 13:11.854
You wouldn't dare.

13:11.938 --> 13:14.814
If I nailed the donolly account
and you made me a partner...

13:14.897 --> 13:18.106
you'd save me the trouble
ofdesigning my own letterhead.

13:18.189 --> 13:21.690
Let me see.
What font would I use?

13:21.773 --> 13:24.147
- You'regonnabeapartner!
- I gotta get the account first.

13:24.231 --> 13:26.231
Please, Mary, you're totally
gonna get the account.

13:26.314 --> 13:29.774
The Greenburg marriage lasted one year,
two months. You win the pot again.

13:29.816 --> 13:31.898
How do you do it?
I was more than four years off.

13:31.981 --> 13:34.440
"I Honestly Love You" by Olivia
Newton-John was their wedding song.

13:34.524 --> 13:36.440
Puts them in
the 1 4-month divorce range.

13:36.524 --> 13:38.940
Speaking of honest love,
Jed was asking about you again.

13:39.023 --> 13:41.107
I don't trust a man
who gets regular pedicures.

13:41.190 --> 13:43.440
- You haven't had a date in two years.
- Your point?

13:43.524 --> 13:45.483
If you're not interested inJed...

13:45.566 --> 13:48.483
there is a handsome Italian man
waiting to marry you in the lobby.

13:48.566 --> 13:50.483
Hide me.
did you talk to him?

13:50.566 --> 13:52.525
Just for a few minutes.
He is so adorable.

13:52.608 --> 13:54.858
- He's not adorable.
- How can you say that?

13:54.942 --> 13:59.025
When we were kids, he followed me for
a summer asking me if I had a vagina.

13:59.108 --> 14:01.192
I think that's adorable.

14:01.275 --> 14:03.275
I gotta get out of here.

14:04.401 --> 14:07.484
- Grab that side.
- You shouldn't hold that against him.

14:07.567 --> 14:10.651
You should give him a chance.
He was a little boy.

14:10.693 --> 14:13.943
Maybe he wanted to be a doctor.
Besides, you do have a vagina.

14:15.568 --> 14:17.860
My, this is hard to push
all by myself.

14:18.944 --> 14:22.735
May you have enough happiness
to keep you sweet...

14:22.819 --> 14:25.443
enough trials to keep you strong...

14:26.568 --> 14:28.944
enough hope to keep you happy...

14:29.028 --> 14:31.319
Enough friends to give you comfort.

14:31.403 --> 14:33.319
enough friends to give you comfort...

14:33.403 --> 14:35.569
- Enough determination...
- And enough determination...

14:35.653 --> 14:38.611
- To make each day a better day...
- To make each day...

14:38.653 --> 14:40.486
- A better day...
- Thanyesterday.

14:40.569 --> 14:42.153
- Than yesterday.
- Raise yourglass.

14:42.237 --> 14:45.779
Congratulations, you guys.
I love you both.

14:48.445 --> 14:51.779
What? You think Kissinger
came up with his own stuff?

14:51.862 --> 14:55.363
Youjust fed the best man
his speech.

14:55.405 --> 14:57.696
Smooth. Real smooth.

14:57.779 --> 15:00.697
You must be Francine.
I saw your article in Yahoo.

15:00.780 --> 15:03.655
- Very impressive.
- God, I hate that picture.

15:03.738 --> 15:05.947
It made me look
like a psychotic poodle.

15:10.613 --> 15:13.447
My fiance has got to see this.

15:13.489 --> 15:15.990
He will just die.

15:16.073 --> 15:19.574
- He should be here by now.
- Most grooms are NI ds.

15:19.656 --> 15:22.198
"Not Into details."

15:22.282 --> 15:24.365
That's Eddie, all right.

15:24.448 --> 15:26.698
- I want you to meet my parents.
- Okay.

15:28.031 --> 15:30.032
Thanks, doll. That rocked.

15:32.449 --> 15:35.157
Mary, meet my parents,
Kitty andJack.

15:35.241 --> 15:37.283
- How do you do?
- So nice to meet you.

15:37.366 --> 15:39.575
- Dad, are you eating the food?
- Mm-hmm.

15:39.658 --> 15:42.533
Champagne is delightful.
Cristal? D.P.?

15:42.616 --> 15:45.576
- Actually, it's Taittinger.
- Exquisite.

15:45.659 --> 15:48.617
Mother, we're not guests. You're not
supposed to be drinking the champagne.

15:51.659 --> 15:54.908
You give my little girl whatever
she wants, no expense spared.

15:54.992 --> 15:58.243
I'll be faxing you a list of the songs
I'll be performing at the reception.

15:58.326 --> 16:01.910
And none of those mini egg rolls.
A lot of important people are coming.

16:01.993 --> 16:05.076
- We've got an impression to make.
- We haven't hired her yet.

16:05.118 --> 16:09.243
And as previously discussed in detail,
you won't be singing at the wedding.

16:11.326 --> 16:13.452
I'm sorry, Mary. Hi.

16:13.494 --> 16:16.160
The belly dancer's here,
and she has a tattoo of an...

16:16.244 --> 16:19.119
It's okay. Penny,
I want you to meet the donollys.

16:19.160 --> 16:21.661
- This is one of my associates, Penny.
- Pleasure.

16:22.744 --> 16:26.995
What I need you to do is go to the
office and prepare the Murdoch file.

16:27.036 --> 16:28.245
Ooh, Murdoch.

16:28.328 --> 16:29.745
As in...

16:29.829 --> 16:30.996
discretion.

16:31.079 --> 16:32.203
Oops.

16:32.287 --> 16:35.954
The Murdoch files. Right.

16:37.620 --> 16:39.537
All right now, wedding woman.

16:39.620 --> 16:41.579
Let's get down to brass tacks.

16:41.620 --> 16:43.580
What do you see for our wedding?

16:44.621 --> 16:48.080
Well, now, having met you...

16:49.872 --> 16:52.705
off the top of my head...

16:52.788 --> 16:54.205
let's see.

16:55.872 --> 16:57.330
Night.

16:58.372 --> 16:59.998
dubounce Botanical Gardens.

17:00.956 --> 17:05.454
White, silk tents
thin enough to see the stars.

17:06.248 --> 17:08.080
Candlelight.

17:08.123 --> 17:10.454
Wedgewood.

17:10.539 --> 17:13.790
Exotic waringin trees
imported from Bali.

17:14.748 --> 17:17.748
I'm thinking Gatsby.

17:17.790 --> 17:19.999
Not a period wedding...

17:20.082 --> 17:22.999
but the spirit of it,
the time.

17:26.374 --> 17:29.417
I nailed it, Geri.
Yeah, but they want it in three months.

17:29.500 --> 17:31.916
They're going forJune.
I know.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.624
The clock is ticking.
Put Penny on.

17:38.916 --> 17:40.875
Guess what, Miss Moneypenny?

17:44.668 --> 17:46.001
Hold on, Penny.

17:48.418 --> 17:50.084
This shoe is stuck.

17:59.252 --> 18:01.461
Not my good shoes.

18:01.544 --> 18:03.085
Oh, my goodness.

18:08.918 --> 18:11.127
My new Gucci shoe.

18:11.210 --> 18:13.378
Come on!

18:21.297 --> 18:24.088
Oh, are you okay?
Are you okay?

18:26.672 --> 18:28.298
I'm great.

18:28.381 --> 18:30.673
- Okay.
- Where's my shoe?

18:30.757 --> 18:33.757
Your shoe?
You got it right here.

18:33.840 --> 18:36.423
Now talk to me.
How are you feeling?

18:36.506 --> 18:40.840
Are you experiencing any dizziness,
nausea, difficulty breathing?

18:42.632 --> 18:44.215
The breathing thing rings a bell.

18:46.340 --> 18:50.091
Then again, you are on top of me,
cutting off my air supply.

18:51.507 --> 18:54.758
Your mental clarity's excellent.
That's good. That's good.

18:55.841 --> 18:58.300
don't appear to have a concussion.

18:58.341 --> 19:00.300
You took quite a fall.

19:00.341 --> 19:02.300
Why are you still on top of me?

19:07.009 --> 19:09.134
That's a good question.

19:09.217 --> 19:12.760
You see that dumpster there?
Seems that dumpster tried to kill you.

19:12.843 --> 19:15.968
You were standing in the middle of the
road, and it was coming right at you.

19:16.052 --> 19:18.468
Just take your time.
Sit up straight. You okay?

19:20.593 --> 19:22.052
You saved...

19:23.260 --> 19:24.718
my shoe.

19:26.052 --> 19:27.469
My life.

19:28.969 --> 19:32.053
Your shoe was what I was going for.
Youjust turned out to be a bonus.

19:32.136 --> 19:34.802
Come on. We're gonna try and get up.
Take your time.

19:34.886 --> 19:36.802
Take your time.

19:36.844 --> 19:38.969
Up.

19:39.053 --> 19:41.636
Here we go.
I got you. I got you.

19:44.054 --> 19:46.179
I got you, okay?

19:48.471 --> 19:51.928
You smell like sweet red plums...

19:51.970 --> 19:56.096
and grilled cheese sandwiches.

19:58.597 --> 20:00.679
Okay. Here you go.

20:03.804 --> 20:06.513
Yeah, I get that all the time.
Thank you.

20:06.597 --> 20:10.305
All right. Hold up!
All right.

20:11.389 --> 20:13.348
Yup, she's dead, all right.

20:13.389 --> 20:16.556
- You think she's going to heaven?
- Definitely.

20:16.640 --> 20:19.723
She's got the cleanest toes
I've ever seen.

20:19.805 --> 20:21.972
Where am I?

20:22.056 --> 20:25.931
You're at the children's ward
of St. Vincent's Hospital.

20:26.015 --> 20:28.766
I'm your doctor.
Try not to talk.

20:32.307 --> 20:33.432
My God.

20:33.474 --> 20:36.057
I'm paralyzed. I'm paralyzed!

20:36.140 --> 20:39.641
If you're moving your arms and legs,
you're clearly not paralyzed.

20:40.725 --> 20:41.892
Boo!

20:43.808 --> 20:45.516
Yes, thank you.
There's my fashlight.

20:45.600 --> 20:47.850
Thank you.
How's our patient doing?

20:47.933 --> 20:51.642
- It was touch and go for a while.
- Was it? What do you recommend?

20:52.808 --> 20:54.725
I think she needs more fuids.

20:54.808 --> 20:57.768
Why don't you go load her up
with 10 cc's of Yoo-Hoo, all right?

20:57.809 --> 20:59.018
Here we go.

21:02.060 --> 21:03.851
- You're the guy...
- Steve Edison.

21:03.935 --> 21:06.018
I'm the supervising
pediatrician here.

21:06.101 --> 21:09.434
- Mary...
- Fiore. Yeah, I know.

21:09.476 --> 21:11.769
I had to go through your wallet
to get your identification.

21:11.810 --> 21:14.518
I must say, I've never met anyone who
alphabetized her credit cards before.

21:16.352 --> 21:18.393
Here's the skinny on you.

21:18.477 --> 21:22.102
YourX-rays are fine.
Hemoglobin levels are normal.

21:22.186 --> 21:25.686
We're just waiting on the CAT scan to
be processed, then we can get you out.

21:25.728 --> 21:28.187
You can take this offnow.

21:29.270 --> 21:31.811
- Oh, you've got a big neck.
- I have a big neck?

21:31.895 --> 21:34.270
don't get me wrong.
It's a fine neck.

21:34.353 --> 21:37.728
It's just that haven't had a patient
over the age of six in three years.

21:47.313 --> 21:49.396
What happened to your hand?

21:50.355 --> 21:54.396
My hand. You fell on it
with your big neck.

22:31.566 --> 22:34.191
Your CAT scan came back,
and it's all clear.

22:35.274 --> 22:37.233
- So I'm okay?
- You're better than new.

22:39.359 --> 22:43.942
Speaking ofnew, that's a pretty
modern girl you have there.

22:44.025 --> 22:46.108
- Who?
- Your girlfriend.

22:48.067 --> 22:52.067
No, that's my sister.
I guess you could say she's modern.

22:52.150 --> 22:55.610
The last time I saw her,
she had a spike through her chin.

22:55.693 --> 22:56.693
Oh, my.

22:58.068 --> 23:00.860
What I don't understand
is how she got near the dumpster!

23:00.943 --> 23:02.485
Miss?

23:02.568 --> 23:05.318
- Oh, my God, you're alive!
- How did you find me?

23:05.401 --> 23:08.945
I'm so happy! The nurse found my
phone number taped to your Palm Pilot.

23:09.027 --> 23:11.653
She told me what happened, and...

23:13.861 --> 23:16.277
Is this the guy who saved you?

23:18.319 --> 23:21.736
I wouldn't exactly
call it a rescue.

23:21.820 --> 23:24.362
I was just in the right place
at the right time.

23:25.195 --> 23:28.447
Well, aren't youjust
the modern-day hero?

23:36.156 --> 23:37.364
Are you okay?

23:42.990 --> 23:45.074
Fabulous.

23:45.157 --> 23:47.199
Penny Nicholson.
Nice to meet you.

23:47.281 --> 23:51.199
I'm Steve Edison.
Nice to meet you too.

23:51.282 --> 23:53.950
Have a seat. Make yourself comfortable.
Mary's gonna be fine.

23:53.991 --> 23:58.741
So, you must work long hours.
Are you working late tonight?

23:58.825 --> 24:00.991
No, I'm not even on duty tonight.

24:01.908 --> 24:03.367
Great!

24:04.699 --> 24:07.616
You know, Mary and I were
gonna go to Golden Gate Park.

24:07.699 --> 24:10.201
They show old movies
on the side of the museum.

24:10.284 --> 24:12.159
You should come with us.

24:12.243 --> 24:16.409
- We won't take no for an answer.
- Will you leave him alone, please?

24:16.492 --> 24:18.575
Oh, you don't want me to go?

24:19.451 --> 24:21.951
Of course she wants you to go.

24:23.327 --> 24:27.077
You know, the truth is, doctor...

24:27.160 --> 24:30.785
that I've been thinking
about a career in medicine.

24:30.868 --> 24:34.160
Something medicinal or whatnot.

24:34.202 --> 24:37.619
I'd really like to
just pick apart your brain.

24:37.701 --> 24:39.744
- Do not leave me here.
- I know what's best for you.

24:39.828 --> 24:41.744
I'm gonna get you over this Keith thing
once and for all!

24:41.828 --> 24:43.869
It's only been sixyears.

24:43.953 --> 24:45.911
It's not a date!

24:45.994 --> 24:48.328
do not leave me alone. Please.

24:48.412 --> 24:50.662
- It's for your own good.
- Don't you dare!

24:52.370 --> 24:54.413
- There he is.
- There's your gum ball.

24:54.454 --> 24:57.995
Thank you. Oh, good. Boy, you
can never get the colors you want.

24:58.079 --> 24:59.496
Okay, well.

25:00.663 --> 25:02.579
Oh, no!

25:02.663 --> 25:05.162
darn it. I just remembered
that I promised...

25:05.246 --> 25:09.038
my friend's brother's godmother...

25:09.122 --> 25:11.955
that I would help her...

25:12.038 --> 25:14.996
change her fax cartridge tonight...

25:15.080 --> 25:18.372
because she's going
out of town tomorrow...

25:18.414 --> 25:20.038
on an African safari.

25:21.038 --> 25:22.956
I should go do that.

25:23.039 --> 25:25.665
I'm really sorry that we're not
gonna be able to have that...

25:25.748 --> 25:27.498
- Medical chat.
- Medical chat, yeah.

25:31.456 --> 25:33.957
Okay. Bye.

25:34.039 --> 25:35.832
- Penny.
- Wow.

25:35.915 --> 25:38.041
Goodness, I hope her...

25:39.165 --> 25:43.041
friend's brother's godmother
is gonna be okay.

25:43.083 --> 25:45.874
You know,
I have reserved seating.

25:45.916 --> 25:48.207
- All right.
- Okay. Let's go.

25:50.416 --> 25:53.375
- Thanks for guarding my tree.
- Yes, I'm guarding your tree.

25:53.417 --> 25:55.709
There's your blanket right there
under your tree I kept for you.

25:55.750 --> 25:58.959
- Thank you, Burt. This is Steve Edison.
- Steve, how you do? Nice to meet you.

25:59.042 --> 26:01.126
- Pleased to meet you.
- It's about time you had a date.

26:01.209 --> 26:03.750
- It's not...
- What line of business are you in?

26:03.792 --> 26:06.417
- I'm a doctor at St. Vincent's.
- You a doctor?

26:06.500 --> 26:09.043
He's a doctor.
Well, I get the hint.

26:09.127 --> 26:11.751
See you at the Scrabble
practice, kid.

26:13.127 --> 26:16.501
Sorry. I'm so sorry about that.

26:16.543 --> 26:18.751
Scrabble practice?

26:18.835 --> 26:20.751
Please, don't ask.

26:20.835 --> 26:22.877
Come on. You can't
leave me hanging on that.

26:22.961 --> 26:27.419
"See you at Scrabble practice, kid"?
What's that?

26:27.502 --> 26:29.919
I'm a member of
the BayArea Scrabble Club.

26:29.961 --> 26:32.502
- Pathetic, I know.
- Wow.

26:32.585 --> 26:34.961
- What?
- That is pathetic.

26:35.003 --> 26:37.421
Shut up.

26:37.462 --> 26:40.212
At least I can spell.
What can you do?

26:40.296 --> 26:42.962
- I throw a mean yo-yo.
- You know what?

26:43.004 --> 26:46.546
- No more caramel corn for you.
- I'm serious.

26:46.628 --> 26:49.962
How'd you get into it? I've never met
a member of a Scrabble Club before.

26:50.045 --> 26:51.963
That's for sure.

26:53.879 --> 26:56.879
When my parents came over
from Italy...

26:56.921 --> 26:59.963
the yjoined a Scrabble Club
so they could learn English.

27:01.046 --> 27:05.463
After my mom died, my dad became,
like, obsessed with the game...

27:05.547 --> 27:08.089
and wanted me to play with him
all the time...

27:08.172 --> 27:10.797
so I guess, in a way,
I was destined.

27:12.131 --> 27:14.047
C-O-O-L.

27:22.340 --> 27:23.840
What are you doing?

27:27.340 --> 27:29.340
I only eat the brown ones.

27:29.424 --> 27:30.841
Because?

27:32.132 --> 27:34.923
'Cause I figure they have
less artificial coloring...

27:34.965 --> 27:38.258
'cause chocolate's already brown.

27:38.341 --> 27:40.550
That's very scientific of you,
dr. Steve.

27:40.633 --> 27:41.800
Thank you.

27:45.592 --> 27:47.717
So where would one go
to see a Scrabble match?

27:47.800 --> 27:50.550
Oh, look. It's starting.

27:56.593 --> 28:01.384
Andcloser

28:01.426 --> 28:05.010
tome

28:10.468 --> 28:12.969
- Oh, that'sbeautiful.
- Youlikeit?

28:13.052 --> 28:14.510
Yes.

28:28.887 --> 28:33.179
This is by far the coolest thing
I've ever done in this city.

28:37.305 --> 28:41.598
the closer youare

28:41.639 --> 28:46.098
- The brigh ter the starsglow
- Wanna dance?

28:46.140 --> 28:50.891
I don't know. I haven't danced
in quite some time.

28:50.974 --> 28:54.433
- Okay.
- Girl asks you to dance, you dance.

28:56.849 --> 29:00.433
Burt's right.
Yes, Mary, I would love to dance.

29:01.891 --> 29:05.099
- No pressure.
- It's too late now.

29:13.267 --> 29:14.683
Okay.

29:23.018 --> 29:25.976
Where'd you learn
to dance like this?

29:26.018 --> 29:28.143
Ballroom class.

29:28.185 --> 29:30.477
Oh, you're gay.

29:30.518 --> 29:32.809
Oh, yeah, the gayest.

29:38.352 --> 29:41.852
My mother put me
in ballroom classes...

29:41.935 --> 29:43.894
when I was eight years old.

29:43.935 --> 29:47.478
She wanted me to be Fred Astaire.
I wanted to be Marcus Welby.

29:49.102 --> 29:51.812
So now you're
a little bit ofboth?

29:53.978 --> 29:56.103
I think you're being kind.

29:56.145 --> 29:58.978
You can stop that.
I'm gonna blush.

30:03.520 --> 30:05.438
How's your thumb?

30:06.855 --> 30:08.271
Never better.

30:29.814 --> 30:31.689
YMCA.

30:31.773 --> 30:34.481
My next Scrabble match
is Saturday...

30:34.522 --> 30:37.565
at 1:00 at the north side YMCA.

30:37.648 --> 30:40.149
It'll be the social event
of the season.

30:41.607 --> 30:43.857
Maybe you should be there.

30:47.982 --> 30:51.233
- Maybe you shouldn't step on my foot.
- Did I?

30:51.275 --> 30:52.816
- Yes.
- I'm sorry.

30:52.900 --> 30:55.025
That's okay.
Just don't let it happen again.

30:56.900 --> 30:58.357
don't tell me what to do.

30:58.441 --> 30:59.858
don't what?

31:36.487 --> 31:38.111
Holy shit!

31:38.195 --> 31:40.612
Are you guys crazy?
This isn't funny!

31:40.694 --> 31:44.278
I am thinking teal for the bridesmaids.
What do you think?

31:46.612 --> 31:48.945
Good morning. Earth to Mary.

31:49.029 --> 31:51.529
What is up with you?
You're different.

31:51.613 --> 31:54.112
I'm not different.
How am I different?

31:54.196 --> 31:56.196
You can't stop smiling.

31:57.613 --> 31:59.613
I'm not smiling.
Am I smiling?

31:59.696 --> 32:01.945
Like a fool.

32:02.029 --> 32:04.364
- Tell me.
- It's nothing.

32:04.447 --> 32:06.946
Then stop smiling.

32:07.030 --> 32:09.739
- I can't.
- Okay, who is he?

32:14.905 --> 32:16.864
Okay. No, no!

32:16.946 --> 32:20.239
Mr. Kotsioupolis, you cannot throw
plates at the Ritz-fucking-Carlton!

32:21.323 --> 32:22.490
It's okay.

32:22.573 --> 32:24.323
This is like a fairy tale.

32:24.406 --> 32:26.907
He saves your life.
You dance under the stars.

32:26.989 --> 32:29.698
- You kiss in the rain.
- Almost kissed.

32:29.782 --> 32:33.866
I don't know, Fran. I've been so out
of the dating-relationship loop.

32:33.949 --> 32:35.282
You?

32:35.324 --> 32:39.532
You know, those who can't do, teach?
Those who can't wed, plan.

32:39.616 --> 32:42.532
With my help, you could marry
this man in three months.

32:43.407 --> 32:46.658
I have totally lost control.
Will you please, please, please help me?

32:46.741 --> 32:48.617
Penny, if you can't beat 'em...

32:49.742 --> 32:52.450
- What has gotten into you?
- She met a guy.

32:52.533 --> 32:55.367
You met a guy? You mean...

33:00.659 --> 33:03.868
- I wanna hear all about it!
- I owe you one, Penny.

33:03.952 --> 33:06.035
You do. You owe me one!

33:08.284 --> 33:11.202
- Hello, Rene. How are you?
- Great.

33:11.285 --> 33:13.701
Listen, they're gonna be
signing up for six classes.

33:13.785 --> 33:16.451
Sojust be sure
to pay up front, okay?

33:16.493 --> 33:18.702
Basil himself
is gonna be here today.

33:18.786 --> 33:20.702
- Really?
- Yes.

33:22.702 --> 33:25.203
I'll have to call you back.
Okay. Bye.

33:26.619 --> 33:28.869
Mary, what are you doing here?

33:28.953 --> 33:31.328
Oh, my God.
I'm so embarrassed.

33:31.411 --> 33:33.329
I may be a hell
of a businesswoman...

33:33.412 --> 33:36.371
but when I dance,
I look like a retarded string bean.

33:36.454 --> 33:38.454
I thought your class
wasn't till Thursday though.

33:38.536 --> 33:41.246
I know. We had to change it.
But this is perfect.

33:41.287 --> 33:44.662
You can finally meet Eddie.
Come here. Eddie.

33:44.745 --> 33:46.662
Eddie, come here.

33:46.745 --> 33:48.788
I want you to meet
the wedding planner.

33:48.829 --> 33:51.538
The two most important people
in my life set eyes on one another.

33:51.621 --> 33:54.040
Eddie, this is Mary,
the wedding planner.

33:54.831 --> 33:56.748
Mary, this is my fiance Eddie.

34:09.873 --> 34:13.583
- Mary, are you okay?
- Uh-huh. Yup. Good.

34:16.208 --> 34:17.917
Let's see who that is.

34:20.583 --> 34:22.583
Hi, dad. Wait.

34:22.668 --> 34:25.458
I can't hear you. Hang on.
All right. Okay, I got you.

34:26.875 --> 34:29.208
Okay, I'm losing you again.
I'm sorry.

34:29.251 --> 34:32.585
Shoot. Okay, wait, wait.
Hello. Do you hear me?

34:32.668 --> 34:32.835
Quickly, people.
Get your tootsies out here, pronto.

34:32.835 --> 34:35.793
Quickly, people.
Get your tootsies out here, pronto.

34:35.877 --> 34:38.877
Welcome to the Basil St. Mosely
School of dance.

34:38.918 --> 34:41.377
I am Basil St. Mosely.

34:41.418 --> 34:44.126
Hang on. I can't hear you.
Wait a second. I can't hear you.

34:44.210 --> 34:46.418
You're breaking up. Hang on.

34:46.460 --> 34:47.920
There you go.

34:47.962 --> 34:51.628
I'd like all my lovely couples,
dancing partners, paired up in twos...

34:51.670 --> 34:53.837
ready to dance, not next week,
not tomorrow, but now.

34:53.920 --> 34:55.837
- Dance with Eddie.
- I can't.

34:55.920 --> 34:58.169
Quickly.
Is there a problem in the room?

34:58.211 --> 35:01.336
Pronto, people. I'd like us to still
be young when this class is over.

35:01.378 --> 35:03.004
I have to take this call.

35:03.046 --> 35:05.337
darling, I understand you're busy.
I'm busy too.

35:05.379 --> 35:07.546
- You're holding up the class.
- She's with him.

35:07.629 --> 35:08.879
All right.

35:08.963 --> 35:12.129
Mary, watch out for his thumb.
He hurt it saving some old lady.

35:12.212 --> 35:14.754
- Sorry, I can't.
- Listen, I got a prior engagement.

35:14.838 --> 35:16.796
Interesting choice of words.

35:16.839 --> 35:19.089
Wallfowers,
it's time to blossom and bloom.

35:19.172 --> 35:22.839
Obviously, what we have here, people,
is a fear ofdancing.

35:22.922 --> 35:26.630
It's my firm belief
we must conquer one's fears.

35:26.713 --> 35:29.922
Now, I have to gauge
what I am dealing with...

35:30.005 --> 35:32.673
so I will play music,
you will dance...

35:32.714 --> 35:34.464
and I will observe.

35:34.548 --> 35:35.631
Okay, Rene?

35:35.714 --> 35:35.881
Yes, thank you.

35:35.881 --> 35:37.631
Yes, thank you.

35:39.257 --> 35:41.589
Mary, would you like to dance?

35:41.673 --> 35:43.881
Have no fear. Dance. Dance.

35:45.257 --> 35:46.674
Yes.

35:49.007 --> 35:51.590
- Old lady, huh?
- Listen, this is...

35:51.674 --> 35:53.966
- You told me your name was Steve.
- It is Steve.

35:54.007 --> 35:56.590
My last name is Edison.
Fran calls me Eddie. It's a nickname.

35:56.674 --> 36:00.049
I have a better nickname for you.
How about common, cheating, sleazy...

36:00.133 --> 36:01.216
If you're thinking...

36:01.299 --> 36:04.008
What I'm thinking involves
a machete and a pair ofpliers.

36:04.050 --> 36:05.134
Okay.

36:09.551 --> 36:12.134
- The day that you had the accident.
- That was a special day.

36:12.217 --> 36:13.509
It was. I was running late.

36:13.592 --> 36:15.217
How convenient.

36:15.300 --> 36:18.634
I was meeting Fran and our wedding
planner, which you turned out to be.

36:18.717 --> 36:20.593
What are the odds?

36:20.635 --> 36:22.801
dance. Dance!

36:25.051 --> 36:28.801
don't dance around the issue. You didn't
show 'cause you don't wanna get married.

36:28.884 --> 36:31.844
- I see it all the time.
- You see what?

36:31.927 --> 36:34.969
Why'd you tell your fiancee
you saved an old lady?

36:35.052 --> 36:36.927
Exactly!

36:37.010 --> 36:39.844
You think you want to get married,
but you don't.

36:39.885 --> 36:43.344
You're pitiful and confused, looking
to get some hot pepper wherever you can.

36:43.386 --> 36:46.011
Mary, you have no idea
what you're talking about.

36:46.053 --> 36:47.262
Yeah?

36:47.345 --> 36:48.928
Why did you go
to the movies with me?

36:49.011 --> 36:51.679
Why did Steve go to the movies
with you? Let's see.

36:51.762 --> 36:54.095
First of all,
Steve likes the movies.

36:54.178 --> 36:55.762
Steve had the night off.

36:55.846 --> 36:57.928
Steve said, "Hey, you know what?

36:58.011 --> 37:00.971
A movie sounds good."
Plus he got an invitation.

37:01.012 --> 37:03.221
Why is Steve referring to himself
in the third person?

37:03.304 --> 37:05.221
What are you talking about?

37:05.304 --> 37:08.972
Think you can double-talk your way out,
throw me off your scent? I smell you!

37:09.012 --> 37:11.680
And I smell like sweet red plums
and grilled cheese sandwiches.

37:11.763 --> 37:13.179
- What?
- Yes.

37:13.221 --> 37:15.764
- So you said before you passed out.
- I did not!

37:15.848 --> 37:18.806
You did too. If anybody was
looking to get some, it's M-A-R-Y.

37:18.889 --> 37:20.514
You are hideous.

37:20.597 --> 37:22.973
Okay. Then why'd you
ask me to dance?

37:23.056 --> 37:24.556
- I didn't.
- You did too.

37:24.597 --> 37:26.931
- I did not.
- You said, "Would you like to dance?"

37:27.014 --> 37:30.807
And even if I did,
I'm not the one who's engaged.

37:30.890 --> 37:32.807
It was a dance.

37:32.890 --> 37:34.974
Whoop-dee-doo.
It didn't mean anything.

37:36.141 --> 37:37.765
Then why'd you almost kiss me?

37:40.515 --> 37:43.265
This pair, this lovely couple...

37:43.348 --> 37:46.017
they have it,
they know what it takes.

37:47.558 --> 37:49.683
Very well done.

37:51.142 --> 37:52.349
We need to powwow.

37:55.683 --> 37:58.225
As soon as dad mentioned it,
I went, "Of course."

37:58.308 --> 38:01.268
Everybody knows that
it's the place to get married.

38:01.309 --> 38:04.018
Sure, Fran.
A vineyard sounds perfect.

38:04.101 --> 38:06.351
- We should check it out right away.
- I already have.

38:06.434 --> 38:10.600
We have reservations for this weekend,
but you'll have to take off Friday.

38:10.684 --> 38:14.517
Friday? Friday's not good for me.
I have a diverticulitis seminar planned.

38:14.600 --> 38:17.852
- Okay. Saturday.
- Saturday.

38:17.935 --> 38:20.893
Saturday. All right, Mary?
Thanks for everything.

38:20.935 --> 38:23.394
Nice to meet you. Thanks for the dance.
We'll let you know how it all goes.

38:23.436 --> 38:26.727
- Pleasure to meet you.
- Wait a second. She's coming with us.

38:26.768 --> 38:28.352
- I'm coming?
- She's comin'?

38:28.436 --> 38:29.394
Yes.

38:29.477 --> 38:31.520
You are not quitting
the donolly wedding!

38:32.936 --> 38:35.312
I gotta tell Geri
I'm off the account.

38:36.395 --> 38:37.562
Hold on.

38:37.644 --> 38:39.270
Listen...

38:39.353 --> 38:43.811
the only good reason to quit a wedding
is if you break the cardinal rule...

38:43.853 --> 38:47.438
which is ridiculous because we both know
you did not fall in love with the groom.

38:48.604 --> 38:49.563
What?

38:51.688 --> 38:53.229
You didn't.

38:54.937 --> 38:56.688
Bad.

38:56.770 --> 38:58.730
No, of course not.

38:59.896 --> 39:02.896
I'd never get emotionally involved.

39:02.980 --> 39:05.105
Never. Never.

39:06.274 --> 39:07.566
It's the doctor.

39:09.232 --> 39:12.190
I'm confused. Is it the doctor,
or did you fall for the groom?

39:12.274 --> 39:16.108
No, the doctor is the groom.
The groom is the doctor.

39:16.150 --> 39:18.650
The doctor is Fran donolly's fiance!

39:18.692 --> 39:21.108
The dumpster girl
is your wedding planner?

39:21.191 --> 39:23.108
Yes. I'm in hell.

39:23.191 --> 39:25.275
And I'm in heaven.
Now you can fix me up with her.

39:25.358 --> 39:28.609
I'm not fixing you up, dr. John.
Look, this is complicated enough.

39:28.692 --> 39:31.693
You are one of the top
wedding planners...

39:31.735 --> 39:35.693
in this great, big,
thriving metropolis.

39:35.776 --> 39:38.735
Look on the positive side.
He got you to open up again.

39:38.818 --> 39:40.776
Thank the bastard and move on.

39:40.818 --> 39:43.943
You cannot tell me you would sacrifice
your entire career over this!

39:43.985 --> 39:47.569
You're not telling me that you think
it's a mistake to marry Fran now?

39:47.652 --> 39:50.485
I don't think it's a mistake
to marry Fran. Fran is great.

39:50.569 --> 39:52.319
Yes.

39:53.777 --> 39:55.694
It's just that...

39:57.861 --> 40:00.820
what if what I think is great
really is great...

40:02.695 --> 40:06.112
but it's not as great
as something greater?

40:07.528 --> 40:09.278
You will go through
with this wedding!

40:09.361 --> 40:10.653
Why?

40:10.737 --> 40:14.654
Because you deserve this partnership.
You've earned it!

40:14.738 --> 40:16.738
- You're right.
- Of course I'm right.

40:16.821 --> 40:18.322
Of course you're right.

40:18.404 --> 40:21.322
Your feelings for her,
that's not chemistry, that's anxiety.

40:21.363 --> 40:23.905
- It's nature.
- It's natural.

40:23.988 --> 40:27.363
Natural. It's not chemistry,
it's anxiety.

40:27.446 --> 40:29.614
I can do this.
I can plan this wedding.

40:29.697 --> 40:32.031
The feelings I have for Fran
run deep.

40:32.072 --> 40:34.989
It's not something that can be swept
away in one night with one dance.

40:35.072 --> 40:36.989
Not gonna happen.

40:37.072 --> 40:38.989
- What the hell was I thinking?
- You were thinking wrong.

40:39.072 --> 40:41.989
I was thinking wrong.
I was being a jackass. Come on, Steve.

40:42.072 --> 40:45.656
I can treat that jackass
like any other faceless groom.

40:45.740 --> 40:47.907
That's just what I'm gonna do.
Why?

40:47.948 --> 40:51.282
Because he's nothing!
Because I love a challenge!

40:51.324 --> 40:53.698
And because I am
a goddamn professional!

40:55.990 --> 40:58.866
- So you're gonna give me her number?
- No, I'm not.

41:04.492 --> 41:06.782
I thought that we had
everything covered...

41:06.866 --> 41:10.866
but then I realized Eddie and I
don't have a wedding song.

41:10.908 --> 41:14.909
So I got this wedding compilation
to see if we can find one.

41:16.950 --> 41:18.867
Okay, here we go.

41:23.867 --> 41:26.367
- What do you think?
- That's groovy.

41:26.451 --> 41:29.452
- I like it.
- Let's see what else there is.

41:30.702 --> 41:34.035
You fill up my senses

41:35.202 --> 41:38.577
- What do you think of this one?
- That's groovy too. I like it.

41:38.660 --> 41:39.911
It's kinda cute.

41:39.993 --> 41:41.243
Kinda not.

41:45.411 --> 41:47.077
Ilove you

41:47.161 --> 41:48.453
Oh, my God.

41:48.536 --> 41:51.161
Olivia Newton-John.
I love this song.

41:51.244 --> 41:53.828
- Ihonestlylove you
- This is perfect, isn't it?

41:53.912 --> 41:56.411
Yes, it is perfect.

41:56.495 --> 41:58.245
- It is.
- Yes.

41:58.329 --> 41:59.412
What?

42:01.287 --> 42:03.079
Nothing. It's nothing.

42:03.162 --> 42:07.162
- What, is it a bad song?
- No, I think it's absolutely perfect.

42:07.245 --> 42:09.245
- See? It's perfect.
- It's perfect?

42:09.329 --> 42:11.287
Yes, it is.
It's perfect.

42:11.370 --> 42:13.872
You think so?
We have a song!

42:13.955 --> 42:16.705
I can't believe it.
We have a song.

42:16.747 --> 42:18.622
Ilove you

42:18.705 --> 42:21.622
Ihonestlylove you

42:21.705 --> 42:23.622
What's that, like, 1 983?

42:26.330 --> 42:29.915
Oh, I've been meaning to ask you,
speaking oflove...

42:29.998 --> 42:31.915
what happened to that guy?

42:31.998 --> 42:34.165
You know, the one
that you danced with...

42:37.581 --> 42:40.165
There was a damn deer in the road.

42:41.706 --> 42:42.665
damn it.

42:43.832 --> 42:44.999
Careful.

42:47.124 --> 42:49.582
So, what happened?

42:51.499 --> 42:54.166
- Didn't work out.
- How is that possible?

42:54.249 --> 42:57.833
I saw you three days later,
and you still had stars in your eyes.

43:02.042 --> 43:07.000
Well, he turned out to be the groom
of one of the weddings I was planning.

43:09.250 --> 43:10.666
Yes.

43:10.708 --> 43:13.335
That is the most disgusting thing
I have ever heard.

43:14.210 --> 43:18.293
I would hate to be a single gal with all
those creeps running around out there.

43:18.377 --> 43:21.126
Yeah, Fran, you're really lucky.

43:21.210 --> 43:24.793
Ilove you

43:28.919 --> 43:32.503
Ihonestlylove you

43:42.253 --> 43:42.420
I suppose they'd like to see the gardens
first. Don't you think, Mary?

43:42.420 --> 43:46.170
I suppose they'd like to see the gardens
first. Don't you think, Mary?

43:46.253 --> 43:49.837
Over here is where the actual ceremony
would take place.

43:52.920 --> 43:54.545
What are you doing here?

43:54.629 --> 43:57.921
Your papa tell me where you are,
so I come to surprise you.

43:57.962 --> 44:00.588
I made this for you.

44:01.838 --> 44:03.046
And who is this?

44:03.838 --> 44:06.505
- I'm her fiance.
- What?

44:06.588 --> 44:07.672
Her fiance?

44:08.630 --> 44:11.588
- Buongiorno. I am Massimo.
- I'm Steve.

44:11.673 --> 44:13.006
And I'm Fran.

44:13.089 --> 44:17.381
Oh, my God, Mary, I cannot believe
you didn't tell us you were engaged.

44:17.464 --> 44:18.758
Mary, you're engaged!

44:18.841 --> 44:20.800
That's marvelous!

44:20.883 --> 44:25.466
After all the weddings we've done
together, now finally it's your turn.

44:25.549 --> 44:28.217
- And I am her fiance.
- Congratulations.

44:28.258 --> 44:32.093
We're gonna have to plan something
very special this weekend to celebrate.

44:32.175 --> 44:35.759
- It won't be necessary.
- Yes, it will, because it is wonderful.

44:35.842 --> 44:37.300
It is wonderful.

44:37.342 --> 44:40.842
You've found that somebody special
in your life...

44:40.926 --> 44:42.843
to be honest and faithful to...

44:42.927 --> 44:45.219
until the end of time,
no matter what.

44:46.885 --> 44:49.052
You must take that moment, Mary.

44:50.927 --> 44:52.885
And I am her fiance.

44:57.011 --> 45:00.345
- We're ready for our tour now.
- Certainly. Just follow me.

45:00.427 --> 45:01.844
Wow.

45:03.469 --> 45:08.761
This wedding putting-together
is not a job for a man.

45:08.803 --> 45:11.637
You stay with me
and we will do the manly bonding.

45:12.720 --> 45:15.096
Manly bonding.
You and me.

45:15.137 --> 45:18.096
We'll let the ladies...
I mean, the brides-to-be...

45:18.179 --> 45:20.595
we'll let them go do their thing.

45:20.679 --> 45:21.929
Bye-bye, girls.

45:24.304 --> 45:26.721
How cute is he?

45:26.763 --> 45:28.846
He's so cute.

45:28.888 --> 45:31.555
How long you known Mary?

45:31.638 --> 45:33.680
Way before she had the breasts.

45:33.763 --> 45:37.597
Believe me, back then
she did not look so good.

45:37.680 --> 45:41.931
Look. A center
for the physical fitness.

45:42.014 --> 45:43.973
We do the bonding.
Follow me.

45:44.014 --> 45:45.973
We do the bonding.

46:02.432 --> 46:04.391
Take it easy there, buddy.

46:04.432 --> 46:07.558
- I like the speed.
- You like the speed.

46:09.474 --> 46:10.559
Faster.

46:14.141 --> 46:15.058
Run!

46:20.267 --> 46:21.517
Run like a man!

46:21.600 --> 46:23.016
Like me!

46:26.434 --> 46:27.851
Well, here we are.

46:29.518 --> 46:32.643
Hi, bunny.
Wedding woman.

46:32.726 --> 46:34.643
Mr. Donolly.
Hello, Mrs. Donolly.

46:34.726 --> 46:36.643
What took you guys so long?

46:36.726 --> 46:39.977
We found seven of the most
adorable vineyards on the way up.

46:40.060 --> 46:42.602
- Right by the side of the road.
- All you can drink.

46:42.686 --> 46:45.561
- Really? Great.
- Oh, honey, do you mind?

46:46.435 --> 46:49.103
- How many is that for you?
- Sixty-five.

46:49.185 --> 46:50.644
And you?

46:50.686 --> 46:52.769
- How many?
- Sixty-five.

46:54.144 --> 46:56.062
Same.

46:56.145 --> 46:57.895
Sixty-seven.

47:00.436 --> 47:05.311
Another plus is that their chefis rated
one of the three best on the West Coast.

47:05.395 --> 47:07.520
I really like it, dad.

47:07.603 --> 47:10.105
You know who else was married here?
LesleyAnn Martin.

47:10.188 --> 47:13.105
Herb Martin's daughter?
Forget it. This place is out.

47:13.188 --> 47:16.105
I'm not following
in Herb Martin's shoddy footsteps.

47:16.188 --> 47:19.272
- I didn't see a stage either.
- Find something bigger.

47:19.354 --> 47:20.771
Eddie, what on earth...

47:25.522 --> 47:26.772
What are you doing?

47:26.856 --> 47:28.398
Yeah, just a second.

47:32.480 --> 47:34.398
Good move, honey.

47:40.065 --> 47:42.565
From this valley

47:42.606 --> 47:45.565
they say youareleavin'

47:45.648 --> 47:46.982
It's "going," honey.

47:47.065 --> 47:48.149
Whatever, darling.

47:48.232 --> 47:52.232
Ishallmissyourbrighteyes

47:52.274 --> 47:53.815
Andsweetsmile

47:57.108 --> 48:01.483
I'm starting a nonprofit pediatric
foundation. I want Eddie to head it up.

48:01.567 --> 48:04.774
Can you imagine Eddie CEO
of a major medical foundation?

48:04.858 --> 48:06.816
He wants to
give up his patients?

48:06.899 --> 48:08.858
He does.
He just doesn't know it yet.

48:08.899 --> 48:11.192
He has a hard time
leaving people behind.

48:11.234 --> 48:13.192
Always do the right thing.

48:14.693 --> 48:18.484
I'm sure he doesn't always
do the right thing.

48:18.568 --> 48:18.734
Just the something something

48:18.734 --> 48:20.734
Just the something something

48:20.817 --> 48:24.652
Red River Valley

48:24.735 --> 48:27.152
Mom, would you please shut up!

48:28.777 --> 48:31.652
Whoa! Heel, boy!
Heel! Heel!

48:38.402 --> 48:40.236
Pull on the reins!

48:46.445 --> 48:48.486
Stop! Oh, God!

48:48.570 --> 48:50.903
Horsey! Horsey! Horsey!

48:50.987 --> 48:52.236
Oh, God.

48:55.946 --> 48:57.362
Oh, God.

49:03.654 --> 49:05.071
Tree! Tree!

49:06.738 --> 49:08.154
Hang on, Mary!

49:08.237 --> 49:10.697
I got you! I got you!

49:11.780 --> 49:15.238
On the count of three.
One, two, three!

49:23.656 --> 49:25.198
You okay?

49:41.993 --> 49:44.951
Oh, my God.
You could've been killed.

49:45.035 --> 49:48.243
- It's important to learn how to ride.
- Yeah.

49:48.326 --> 49:51.410
- Eddie, you're riding backwith Mary.
- No, no, really.

49:51.492 --> 49:53.411
don't let her out of your sight.

49:53.493 --> 49:56.493
And the good news is,
I have the wine!

50:00.952 --> 50:03.411
As I walkedouton

50:03.494 --> 50:07.119
thestreets of Laredo

50:18.537 --> 50:21.870
- Thank you for what you did.
- No problem.

50:23.496 --> 50:25.912
You don't have to be
all smug about it.

50:28.246 --> 50:31.496
How about a quick recap here, Mary?

50:31.580 --> 50:34.246
You harpoon me for being engaged...

50:34.330 --> 50:40.164
when, in a zippy and unexpected twist,
you yourself turn out to have a fiance.

50:40.247 --> 50:42.872
Now you have the nerve
to call me smug?

50:42.955 --> 50:45.789
Come on, Mary.
What the hell is your problem?

50:45.830 --> 50:47.789
You're the one with the problem.

50:47.831 --> 50:49.955
I've been doing this a long time...

50:50.039 --> 50:53.332
and I can predict down to the week
how long a couple's going to last.

50:53.373 --> 50:57.540
Are you aware that Fran
has chosen teal for her bridesmaids?

50:57.582 --> 51:00.290
Teal, the color of gangrene.

51:00.373 --> 51:04.582
My last bride who chose teal
got her marriage annulled in 1 2 days.

51:04.665 --> 51:08.791
Oh, oh, and "I Honestly Love You"
as your wedding song?

51:08.875 --> 51:10.958
You might as well commit
matrimonial suicide right now.

51:12.458 --> 51:15.124
You want a confession in blood?
Huh? All right.

51:15.207 --> 51:18.458
That night at the movie,
I was attracted to you.

51:18.541 --> 51:21.416
I was. You caught me.
I admit it.

51:21.499 --> 51:25.751
I mean, let's see, maybe I was a little
unsure about the whole marriage thing.

51:25.834 --> 51:29.084
I don't know,
maybe I was just being a guy...

51:29.167 --> 51:31.709
and an opportunity presented itself.

51:31.792 --> 51:33.084
Bottom line?

51:33.167 --> 51:35.500
I never thought
I'd see you again.

51:35.584 --> 51:38.418
Bottom line?
Nothing happened.

51:39.793 --> 51:41.251
Bottom line?

51:41.335 --> 51:45.710
Now, more than ever,
I believe Fran is the one for me.

51:47.585 --> 51:48.668
So...

51:48.752 --> 51:52.294
I would say,
based on the evidence...

51:52.336 --> 51:56.711
all your theories on love sound like
the rantings of a bitter, cynical woman.

52:00.878 --> 52:06.086
Once I walkedout
on thestreets ofLaredo

52:06.170 --> 52:08.545
AndLaredo walkedout

52:08.587 --> 52:11.545
On thestreets withme

52:32.755 --> 52:34.214
Excuse me.

52:34.297 --> 52:36.214
There's my good boy.

52:56.798 --> 52:58.798
What's going on?

52:58.882 --> 53:02.882
I am measuring you
for your wedding dress.

53:02.965 --> 53:06.174
dad, I want my house key back.
dad, dad, please.

53:07.592 --> 53:09.883
Where's that old wedding dress?

53:09.925 --> 53:12.966
Now we can finally
get rid of this.

53:13.050 --> 53:15.008
dad, put that back!

53:15.091 --> 53:18.008
Hey, Mary,
what do you want on your bagel?

53:18.091 --> 53:20.800
No bagel. No wedding dress.
No wedding.

53:20.884 --> 53:21.801
No wedding?

53:23.134 --> 53:26.051
But Massimo said
you announced your engagement.

53:26.134 --> 53:28.051
I never said that.

53:28.134 --> 53:31.468
My God, this is like
the blind date that wouldn't end.

53:32.802 --> 53:33.968
He's right.

53:34.010 --> 53:38.052
You're frightened by
a mounting attraction for him.

53:38.135 --> 53:39.803
Oh, that's disgusting.

53:40.886 --> 53:44.761
- I told you Mismo was full of crap.
- No Mismo! Massimo!

53:44.844 --> 53:46.469
Go toast the bagel.

53:46.552 --> 53:49.053
Yeah, I'll toast when I see fit.

53:49.094 --> 53:51.553
Mismo, Massimo
or any other kind of"mo."

53:51.595 --> 53:54.386
dad, you cannot
push some guy at me.

53:54.470 --> 53:56.386
That's not how it works.

53:56.470 --> 53:58.386
You know that.
You had Ma.

53:58.470 --> 54:01.970
Yes, and I didn't meet her
until the day of our wedding.

54:02.054 --> 54:03.637
What are you talking about?

54:05.512 --> 54:08.846
Your mother and I
had an arranged marriage.

54:10.222 --> 54:12.346
An arranged marriage?

54:14.471 --> 54:17.554
Wemeton the dayof our wedding.

54:17.638 --> 54:20.055
We couldn't even look at each other.

54:20.097 --> 54:22.597
I was in love
with another girl...

54:22.639 --> 54:26.931
and your mother
wanted nothing to do with me.

54:27.014 --> 54:30.972
She said I had big eyebrows
and a low IQ

54:32.014 --> 54:34.098
Anyway, one day...

54:34.181 --> 54:38.307
I got very sick
with scarlet fever...

54:39.515 --> 54:42.224
and she stayed by my side.

54:42.307 --> 54:44.226
She took good care of me.

54:45.809 --> 54:48.267
For the first time...

54:48.351 --> 54:50.267
I appreciated her.

54:51.435 --> 54:54.394
Then the appreciation
grew to respect.

54:55.726 --> 54:58.143
Respect grew to like.

54:59.602 --> 55:02.851
Then like grew to love.

55:04.310 --> 55:07.269
A deeper love
than I could ever hope for.

55:10.769 --> 55:13.436
So give Massimo a chance.

55:14.977 --> 55:16.936
Maybe you don't like him now...

55:17.019 --> 55:20.229
but maybe
you might love him later.

55:21.312 --> 55:26.270
I should've told you about
your mother and I a long time ago.

55:26.312 --> 55:29.396
Maybe then you'd feel
differently about love.

55:33.479 --> 55:35.938
I don't feel anything about love.

55:40.397 --> 55:42.313
What do you think, Mary?

55:45.146 --> 55:47.063
Oh, the park's great.

55:48.188 --> 55:52.022
You guys would be the first. No one
else has been married here before.

55:56.856 --> 56:00.356
Well, we'd have to construct
the site from scratch...

56:00.439 --> 56:03.856
but at least you wouldn't
have to cut the guest list.

56:03.940 --> 56:06.357
dad would love it.

56:06.440 --> 56:08.941
And what about
the bride and groom-to-be?

56:09.024 --> 56:12.482
- I say, let's take it.
- I thinkwe should keep looking.

56:12.524 --> 56:15.482
- Really?
- Maybe I should give you guys a minute.

56:16.857 --> 56:18.315
You don't like it?

56:21.109 --> 56:22.650
I don't know.

56:22.733 --> 56:24.192
Come on.

56:28.733 --> 56:33.692
All right, if this is what you want,
then I'm... I'm fine with it.

56:35.609 --> 56:38.026
do you see why
I'm marrying this guy?

56:38.776 --> 56:41.734
Because he is so good to me.

56:41.818 --> 56:45.651
Yep, you two will have no problem
planning the wedding while I'm gone.

56:45.734 --> 56:48.193
- I beg your pardon?
- Just for a week.

56:48.276 --> 56:50.194
- Gone?
- I've got to fly back east.

56:50.277 --> 56:53.319
We're looking at buying out
a few of our manufacturers.

56:53.403 --> 56:56.819
- Fran, this is a really critical time.
- That's why we shouldn't lose momentum.

56:56.902 --> 57:00.361
You guys will do a great job.
I trust you.

57:03.694 --> 57:06.112
Fran wants statues at the wedding.

57:06.195 --> 57:11.070
A well-chosen sculpture can help enhance
the tone and theme of the ceremony.

57:11.112 --> 57:13.070
Something like this could be nice.

57:13.153 --> 57:15.070
A little depressing, isn't it?

57:15.153 --> 57:17.945
No, it's wistful and romantic.

57:17.987 --> 57:19.363
Oh.

57:19.446 --> 57:20.862
Okay.

57:25.238 --> 57:28.821
I always pictured
a small wedding myself.

57:28.862 --> 57:31.363
Close friends and family.

57:31.446 --> 57:33.506
On the beach somewhere.
Cool, salty breeze.

57:36.739 --> 57:40.322
You know, the Aphrodite we passed
on the way in might be perfect.

57:40.406 --> 57:42.322
What about this guy?

57:42.406 --> 57:46.030
Well, this is all wrong for a wedding.
It's too menacing.

57:46.114 --> 57:48.657
Mary, I think you're wrong.

57:48.740 --> 57:51.657
He's not menacing.
He's masculine.

57:52.740 --> 57:54.490
He's the protector.

57:54.574 --> 57:56.615
- This man is strong.
- He's naked.

57:56.699 --> 57:57.990
This man is sturdy.

57:58.865 --> 58:00.740
Oh, my God.

58:00.824 --> 58:02.948
Pick him up
before somebody sees.

58:03.908 --> 58:05.324
You all right?

58:07.741 --> 58:10.700
- The man is heavy.
- Oh, my God, there's a guard coming.

58:12.449 --> 58:13.533
There.

58:14.491 --> 58:16.366
Oh, my God.

58:16.449 --> 58:18.324
You castrated him.

58:19.450 --> 58:21.117
Oh, no.

58:21.200 --> 58:22.826
The guard's coming this way.

58:22.909 --> 58:25.868
- I'm sorry, buddy.
- We gotta fix him.

58:26.784 --> 58:29.701
What do you got?
Oh, of course. Krazy Glue.

58:29.784 --> 58:34.035
Why didn't I bring Krazy Glue,
in case his pecker fell off?

58:34.077 --> 58:37.119
- All right, ready?
- Is it sticking?

58:37.201 --> 58:40.451
- You got it?
- Yeah, he's on. Oh, shit.

58:40.535 --> 58:42.827
Steve's stuck.
Steve's glued to his pecker.

58:42.910 --> 58:44.368
- Hi.
- Hi there.

58:44.410 --> 58:46.785
Sir, touching the statues
isn't permitted.

58:46.869 --> 58:48.286
Yes, sir.

58:48.369 --> 58:50.286
You're right.
It's limestone, not granite.

58:50.369 --> 58:53.287
We had a bet going.
She won.

58:53.369 --> 58:54.619
- Sir.
- Yeah?

58:54.703 --> 58:55.953
Your hand, sir.

59:00.661 --> 59:02.494
Yeah, my hand.

59:03.579 --> 59:05.829
Here it is.
You were right.

59:06.579 --> 59:08.163
A limestone penis.

59:09.371 --> 59:11.413
You'd think he'd be bigger, huh?

59:14.371 --> 59:15.787
All right.

59:18.580 --> 59:19.496
Jesus.

59:20.705 --> 59:23.247
What else you got in that?

59:23.289 --> 59:24.872
My entire universe.

59:32.831 --> 59:34.248
- I'm sorry...
- I'm sorry...

59:34.331 --> 59:36.914
- I'm sorry. Go ahead.
- No, you go.

59:37.998 --> 59:40.248
I'm sorry about Napa.

59:41.831 --> 59:45.123
I didn't mean to call you
bitter and cynical. You're not.

59:45.206 --> 59:49.458
And I'm sorry, what I said about
your marriage being doomed to fail.

59:51.416 --> 59:54.332
Well, I apologize for saying
you were just an opportunity.

59:55.624 --> 59:57.585
That was pretty ugly of me.

59:57.626 --> 01:00:01.626
And I was only half serious
about the teal bridesmaid thing.

01:00:02.835 --> 01:00:05.752
Well, at least I have
a 50-50 chance, right?

01:00:07.377 --> 01:00:10.335
You and Fran are gonna be
real happy together.

01:00:11.461 --> 01:00:14.377
So are you and Massimo.
It's gonna work.

01:00:14.461 --> 01:00:18.295
Yeah, well, um,
we're not engaged anymore.

01:00:19.795 --> 01:00:22.086
- Really?
- Really.

01:00:23.545 --> 01:00:25.503
- Are you okay with that?
- Yeah.

01:00:27.378 --> 01:00:30.295
It was more my dad
trying to get us together.

01:00:31.962 --> 01:00:34.171
Why would he want to do that?

01:00:38.379 --> 01:00:41.337
Well, probably because
he was so happy with my mom.

01:00:56.756 --> 01:01:00.089
Fran said to go forward
with the violet chocolate...

01:01:00.173 --> 01:01:02.840
- The chocolate one?
- The one that you suggested.

01:01:02.923 --> 01:01:05.215
Good. Then I'll
put in that order today.

01:01:05.298 --> 01:01:07.506
- How is Fran?
- She's good.

01:01:07.590 --> 01:01:11.339
She's making deals, kickin' butt.
You know, being Fran.

01:01:15.339 --> 01:01:17.507
Oh, nicely done.

01:01:20.924 --> 01:01:23.382
- Thank you, Mary.
- You're welcome.

01:01:23.424 --> 01:01:25.050
You wanna keep it?

01:01:26.258 --> 01:01:27.716
Sure.

01:01:33.633 --> 01:01:36.092
Wow, it's a nice day.

01:01:37.301 --> 01:01:40.259
I agree with you
about the small wedding.

01:01:41.633 --> 01:01:44.051
That's the way I'd do it too.

01:01:52.885 --> 01:01:54.344
Papa.

01:02:00.427 --> 01:02:03.261
How nice to see you.

01:02:04.345 --> 01:02:05.595
Where's my father?

01:02:05.677 --> 01:02:09.553
He's out buying the balloons
for Burt's birthday party.

01:02:10.303 --> 01:02:11.927
Tell him I was here.

01:02:11.969 --> 01:02:13.595
Wait, Mary.

01:02:14.345 --> 01:02:15.678
Are you mad with me?

01:02:15.761 --> 01:02:17.304
Yes...

01:02:17.346 --> 01:02:19.095
I'm mad at you.

01:02:19.179 --> 01:02:21.554
You told my father
we were engaged.

01:02:21.637 --> 01:02:24.554
He tried to measure me
for a wedding dress.

01:02:24.637 --> 01:02:27.596
What is the matter with you?
You never listen.

01:02:27.679 --> 01:02:31.347
Massimo, we are not going to
be together like that. Okay?

01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:34.929
- And why are you in my father's house?
- I am sorry. I will leave you alone.

01:02:36.013 --> 01:02:39.971
From now on, I'll no longer bother you.
We will be just friends.

01:02:40.013 --> 01:02:42.971
Oh, you thinkwe can be friends
just like that?

01:02:43.013 --> 01:02:46.389
I want to apologize
for any madness I caused you.

01:02:46.473 --> 01:02:47.806
Is this a trick?

01:02:47.848 --> 01:02:49.806
No tricks.
I'm very serious.

01:02:50.848 --> 01:02:53.389
I just want for us to be
buddy-buddy.

01:02:54.848 --> 01:02:57.306
I promise you.

01:02:59.181 --> 01:03:01.599
do you have plans for dinner?

01:03:01.682 --> 01:03:05.474
As a friend, I want to
make for you a wonderful...

01:03:05.557 --> 01:03:07.474
American dish.

01:03:08.641 --> 01:03:10.307
Sit. I will start.

01:03:12.724 --> 01:03:15.265
That's your specialty?
Instant macaroni and cheese?

01:03:15.307 --> 01:03:17.725
It is a low-budget wonder.

01:03:17.808 --> 01:03:20.224
Already today,
I've eaten three boxes.

01:03:21.433 --> 01:03:24.017
Nothing like
a well-balanced diet.

01:03:37.310 --> 01:03:41.060
- You remind me so much of your mother.
- You don't remember my mother.

01:03:41.143 --> 01:03:43.185
Yeah, I remember your mother.

01:03:44.268 --> 01:03:46.435
She had the same big smile...

01:03:46.477 --> 01:03:48.644
and the same dark hair.

01:03:48.727 --> 01:03:52.644
She had no nail on her little finger.
I don't remember why.

01:03:54.685 --> 01:03:58.228
A brick fell on it when she was little.
It never grew back.

01:03:58.311 --> 01:04:00.479
You see?
We have much history together.

01:04:00.519 --> 01:04:02.479
I guess we sort ofdo.

01:04:08.561 --> 01:04:11.479
You look like
you have much on your mind.

01:04:11.562 --> 01:04:12.978
Not at all.

01:04:14.103 --> 01:04:15.729
Well, we're friends...

01:04:15.771 --> 01:04:19.188
and friends listen when friends
are not feeling so good...

01:04:19.271 --> 01:04:21.355
so please to tell me.

01:04:25.063 --> 01:04:27.063
There's nothing to tell.

01:04:27.146 --> 01:04:30.064
I thought I could control everything,
and I can't.

01:04:31.189 --> 01:04:34.147
I met someone who I thought was...

01:04:34.189 --> 01:04:35.689
Well, he's not.

01:04:40.897 --> 01:04:44.064
did you ever like somebody,
but the timing was off?

01:04:45.273 --> 01:04:46.524
Way off?

01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:51.357
You feel things
you should not be feeling?

01:04:54.273 --> 01:04:56.190
I'm not making any sense.

01:04:58.273 --> 01:05:00.233
You make much sense.

01:05:02.608 --> 01:05:05.982
You long for him
the way I long for you.

01:05:09.693 --> 01:05:11.610
I don't want you to think...

01:05:11.693 --> 01:05:13.610
I want to tell you something.

01:05:15.528 --> 01:05:18.110
You need to learn patience.

01:05:19.277 --> 01:05:21.236
Love can't always be perfect.

01:05:21.277 --> 01:05:23.236
Love is just love.

01:05:28.528 --> 01:05:30.487
My mom used to say that.

01:05:30.529 --> 01:05:33.112
Your mother was a very wise woman.

01:05:36.487 --> 01:05:37.821
Eat.

01:05:49.239 --> 01:05:54.363
We'll start with camellias as a base,
and anything else that jumps out at you.

01:05:55.446 --> 01:05:57.863
- Let me know.
- Okay.

01:05:57.947 --> 01:05:59.697
Roses.

01:05:59.781 --> 01:06:01.198
Wreaths.

01:06:01.281 --> 01:06:03.365
We don't need any more statues.

01:06:04.531 --> 01:06:05.823
How about this beauty?

01:06:05.864 --> 01:06:07.989
Interesting.

01:06:08.031 --> 01:06:10.614
This is called a bleeding heart...

01:06:10.697 --> 01:06:13.489
the official funeral fower
of Tibet.

01:06:13.531 --> 01:06:15.740
I knew I'd be good at this.

01:06:16.865 --> 01:06:18.782
I'll take
some Slit-My-Wrists-Susans...

01:06:18.865 --> 01:06:20.782
and we'll be ready.

01:06:24.282 --> 01:06:26.199
How'd you guys meet?

01:06:26.282 --> 01:06:28.366
- Me and Fran?
- Yeah.

01:06:28.449 --> 01:06:29.908
College.

01:06:29.991 --> 01:06:31.950
She was in one of your classes?

01:06:31.991 --> 01:06:34.117
No, she was a bookie, actually.

01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:36.658
- Fran was a bookie?
- Yeah, she was.

01:06:36.741 --> 01:06:38.658
She single-handedly established...

01:06:38.741 --> 01:06:41.075
this underground gambling ring
at UC Berkeley...

01:06:41.158 --> 01:06:43.867
took bets on every sporting event
imaginable, ran numbers...

01:06:43.951 --> 01:06:46.867
and even hosted a Vegas night
at her sorority house.

01:06:46.951 --> 01:06:49.368
- You're lying.
- No, that was Fran.

01:06:49.451 --> 01:06:52.410
- Orchids? Does that work?
- Yeah, orchids would work.

01:06:52.451 --> 01:06:53.742
Okay.

01:06:53.826 --> 01:06:55.742
Yeah, she was the coolest.

01:06:55.826 --> 01:06:59.035
I was the bookworm, she was
the wild child, and she picked me.

01:07:00.827 --> 01:07:03.285
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

01:07:04.619 --> 01:07:06.827
- How about cabbage?
- My God.

01:07:08.452 --> 01:07:10.369
- What's the matter?
- Just hide me.

01:07:10.452 --> 01:07:13.412
- Mary, what are you doing?
- Don't say my name!

01:07:13.495 --> 01:07:14.994
Oh, my God.

01:07:34.454 --> 01:07:35.621
You okay?

01:07:35.705 --> 01:07:37.121
I found it.

01:07:40.246 --> 01:07:42.621
Hi. How you doing?
I'm Steve Edison.

01:07:42.663 --> 01:07:45.622
Keith Richmond.
My wife Wendy.

01:07:45.664 --> 01:07:47.831
Nice to meet you, Wendy.

01:07:49.205 --> 01:07:51.580
So, how do you all know each other?

01:07:52.497 --> 01:07:55.664
- It's a long story.
- Oh, let me tell it.

01:07:55.747 --> 01:07:57.664
It's really a funny story.

01:07:57.748 --> 01:07:59.165
See, Keith...

01:07:59.248 --> 01:08:00.915
was my fiance.

01:08:00.999 --> 01:08:04.456
And Wendy was
his high school girlfriend.

01:08:04.498 --> 01:08:07.915
On the night of our rehearsal dinner,
I found them making out.

01:08:10.082 --> 01:08:12.289
In my car.

01:08:13.291 --> 01:08:15.666
I think that covers
all the high points.

01:08:15.708 --> 01:08:17.666
did I leave anything out?

01:08:21.207 --> 01:08:23.125
- You all right?
- Yeah.

01:08:26.375 --> 01:08:27.792
This home?

01:08:30.084 --> 01:08:32.001
You wanna go up?

01:08:43.377 --> 01:08:45.127
All right? You okay?

01:08:45.167 --> 01:08:49.419
Jezebel was the only queen in the Bible
to be eaten by dogs.

01:08:49.502 --> 01:08:52.502
- Did she fall down in the street?
- That's yours.

01:08:54.085 --> 01:08:56.042
Hang on. Hang on.

01:08:59.586 --> 01:09:03.169
- Mr. And Mrs. Wilfred Barber.
- No, it's not that one.

01:09:04.919 --> 01:09:07.336
Nancy Pong.

01:09:13.212 --> 01:09:14.752
Whoisit?

01:09:14.795 --> 01:09:16.837
Nancy Pong? 2C?

01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:19.712
- Yes.
- Nancy, would you buzz us in, please?

01:09:20.462 --> 01:09:22.837
It's Mary Fiore, 7H.

01:09:22.877 --> 01:09:24.754
Who?

01:09:24.837 --> 01:09:26.087
You don't know me.

01:09:27.171 --> 01:09:29.087
We haven't met because...

01:09:30.255 --> 01:09:32.839
I'm a control freak...

01:09:32.879 --> 01:09:35.337
and I don't have time for people.

01:09:37.087 --> 01:09:40.005
But if you ever need
to borrow a cup of sugar...

01:09:41.212 --> 01:09:43.131
I can't help you...

01:09:45.339 --> 01:09:47.798
'cause I don't have time to shop.

01:09:58.215 --> 01:10:00.173
I wanna go home.

01:10:01.465 --> 01:10:03.132
We are home.

01:10:03.215 --> 01:10:05.841
We're just out on the porch.

01:10:05.883 --> 01:10:07.340
All right?

01:10:09.173 --> 01:10:11.091
He's married...

01:10:12.592 --> 01:10:14.884
and they're gonna have a baby.

01:10:17.466 --> 01:10:19.383
And he looked good.

01:10:20.466 --> 01:10:21.758
No, he didn't.

01:10:21.843 --> 01:10:24.302
- No, he really didn't.
- He did.

01:10:27.845 --> 01:10:31.137
Hold it there, please. Thank you.
Here we go. We're in.

01:10:31.178 --> 01:10:34.636
- I don't know him.
- I know, but he'll hold the door for us.

01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:37.803
Come here. Here we go.
Stand up.

01:10:37.887 --> 01:10:39.803
Hold that position. Here we go.

01:10:39.887 --> 01:10:43.346
We got your beer, we got your purse,
we got you, we got your keys.

01:10:43.429 --> 01:10:45.721
Hi there.
Here we go.

01:10:45.762 --> 01:10:48.721
This is somebody that lives
in the same building. Thank you.

01:10:48.762 --> 01:10:50.929
Are you Nancy Pong?

01:10:52.305 --> 01:10:54.430
Okay, a little bit more.

01:10:56.805 --> 01:10:58.722
A little fire.

01:11:05.347 --> 01:11:07.264
Medium well.

01:11:08.555 --> 01:11:11.473
You really don't think
he looked good?

01:11:11.557 --> 01:11:13.973
Oh, no.
He looked old.

01:11:14.056 --> 01:11:15.890
You know?

01:11:15.931 --> 01:11:18.973
Unhappy and fat.
He put on a couple pounds.

01:11:19.056 --> 01:11:20.473
Be quiet.

01:11:26.474 --> 01:11:28.932
He said they were just friends...

01:11:30.308 --> 01:11:32.391
but deep down, I knew better.

01:11:39.683 --> 01:11:41.601
I was just a stand-in.

01:11:43.142 --> 01:11:45.225
A poor man's Wendy.

01:11:49.933 --> 01:11:52.559
She threw my bridal shower for me.

01:11:52.642 --> 01:11:56.893
She even took time to freeze mint leaves
and raspberries in ice cubes.

01:11:56.934 --> 01:12:00.059
That should've tipped me off
right there.

01:12:00.143 --> 01:12:02.059
She was trying too hard.

01:12:06.852 --> 01:12:08.268
Jerk.

01:12:12.269 --> 01:12:15.311
It's a good thing I didn't marry him.

01:12:21.519 --> 01:12:23.936
But most of the time I think...

01:12:28.021 --> 01:12:30.604
I just wasn't enough.

01:12:36.104 --> 01:12:38.520
No, no, no, you're wrong.

01:12:44.772 --> 01:12:46.688
And another thing.

01:12:49.313 --> 01:12:50.730
This Wendy...

01:12:52.855 --> 01:12:56.065
she's nothing but a poor man's Mary.

01:13:25.816 --> 01:13:27.233
It's getting late.

01:13:32.858 --> 01:13:34.608
I'd better go.

01:13:40.026 --> 01:13:41.984
I'll walk you to the door.

01:13:42.026 --> 01:13:44.984
- That's all right. Stay there.
- No, it's okay.

01:13:47.318 --> 01:13:49.734
- Wait.
- Take your time. You all right?

01:13:56.235 --> 01:13:59.152
Thanks for tonight.
I know that I was a mess.

01:13:59.235 --> 01:14:02.444
No, you weren't a mess.

01:14:03.611 --> 01:14:05.069
A little bit.

01:14:07.027 --> 01:14:08.110
Shut up.

01:14:08.194 --> 01:14:10.779
- You gonna be okay?
- Yeah.

01:14:10.861 --> 01:14:14.820
Two aspirin, a lot of water,
sleep, and a beer in the morning.

01:14:14.862 --> 01:14:16.986
That's the cure.

01:14:17.070 --> 01:14:19.236
- Good night, Mary.
- Good night.

01:14:54.365 --> 01:14:56.531
You ever think about
that night in the park?

01:14:56.615 --> 01:14:57.823
What?

01:15:02.448 --> 01:15:04.406
I barely know you.

01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:08.491
I don't know your dad's first name.

01:15:08.574 --> 01:15:13.158
I don't know if you ever wore braces
or contacts or glasses.

01:15:13.241 --> 01:15:16.158
I have no idea how you came to be
a wedding planner, Mary.

01:15:22.075 --> 01:15:24.242
But I know
the curves of your face...

01:15:27.368 --> 01:15:30.326
and I know every feck of gold
in your eyes.

01:15:35.577 --> 01:15:37.869
And I know that
that night in the park...

01:15:41.329 --> 01:15:43.912
was the best time I've ever had.

01:15:58.205 --> 01:15:59.913
Please say something.

01:16:01.955 --> 01:16:04.538
I'm a magnet for unavailable men...

01:16:08.122 --> 01:16:10.081
and I'm sick of it.

01:16:14.581 --> 01:16:15.997
It's simple.

01:16:18.331 --> 01:16:19.789
I know Fran.

01:16:21.498 --> 01:16:22.957
I respect her.

01:16:25.457 --> 01:16:26.915
And she loves you.

01:16:31.666 --> 01:16:34.249
So, besides your tux measurements...

01:16:36.249 --> 01:16:38.208
that's all I need to know.

01:16:45.333 --> 01:16:47.041
Please go away.

01:16:54.292 --> 01:16:56.084
Good night, Mary.

01:17:17.794 --> 01:17:19.752
How do you word an invitation...

01:17:19.794 --> 01:17:22.253
where both sets ofparents
are paying for the wedding...

01:17:22.294 --> 01:17:25.253
the groom is in the military,
about to receive a medical degree...

01:17:25.294 --> 01:17:28.920
and the bride is a widow whose father
recently had a sex-change operation...

01:17:29.003 --> 01:17:32.461
and now goes by the name
Sugar Pie de Santo?

01:17:32.545 --> 01:17:34.503
- Mary?
- What is it?

01:17:34.545 --> 01:17:36.503
A little tense?

01:17:36.545 --> 01:17:39.504
Just terribly, terribly...

01:17:39.587 --> 01:17:40.671
alert.

01:17:45.379 --> 01:17:46.587
What's the matter?

01:17:46.671 --> 01:17:48.712
I came back early.

01:17:50.712 --> 01:17:53.630
Why?
I mean, is everything okay?

01:17:53.713 --> 01:17:55.880
I've discovered something.

01:17:57.547 --> 01:18:00.964
I've been blind.
I didn't want to see it.

01:18:01.839 --> 01:18:04.422
I tried to ignore the signs.

01:18:05.547 --> 01:18:07.631
I think you know
what I'm talking about.

01:18:07.673 --> 01:18:11.382
Let me explain.
It's not what you think.

01:18:11.465 --> 01:18:12.923
Yes, it is.

01:18:14.673 --> 01:18:16.714
I can't go through with this wedding.

01:18:18.465 --> 01:18:20.006
But, Fran...

01:18:20.048 --> 01:18:23.424
I was in a meeting
talking about Boccolino mozzarella...

01:18:23.508 --> 01:18:26.425
and it hit me
that this isn't going to work.

01:18:27.799 --> 01:18:30.924
I can't stand the way
he chews on pen caps...

01:18:31.007 --> 01:18:33.966
or the songs
that he sings in the shower.

01:18:34.007 --> 01:18:39.634
It drives me nuts, how he hikes up his
left pant leg after he's eaten too much.

01:18:41.008 --> 01:18:45.092
Is Eddie gonna be the last man
that I sleep with...

01:18:45.175 --> 01:18:46.592
ever?

01:18:48.551 --> 01:18:53.009
I've been with him so long, I don't
even know why we're together anymore.

01:19:00.926 --> 01:19:02.218
Look at me.

01:19:05.301 --> 01:19:07.219
You are exquisite.

01:19:09.886 --> 01:19:11.052
You're timeless.

01:19:13.219 --> 01:19:16.177
And you have the love
of a man named Steve.

01:19:18.177 --> 01:19:23.637
A man who, while you were away having
meetings about mozzarella, said to me...

01:19:23.721 --> 01:19:26.637
"I can't believe she picked me.

01:19:29.303 --> 01:19:33.262
I can't believe I'm marrying the most
incredible woman I've ever met."

01:19:39.638 --> 01:19:42.596
So that tells me
that this marriage of yours...

01:19:44.013 --> 01:19:45.972
is not only gonna work...

01:19:48.596 --> 01:19:50.723
it's gonna last forever.

01:19:53.305 --> 01:19:54.431
Really?

01:19:57.181 --> 01:19:58.389
Really.

01:20:02.140 --> 01:20:03.597
Thank you.

01:20:07.432 --> 01:20:09.391
Thank you, thank you.

01:20:12.974 --> 01:20:13.099
For he's a jolly good fellow

01:20:13.099 --> 01:20:15.266
For he's a jolly good fellow

01:20:15.349 --> 01:20:18.182
For he's a jolly good fellow

01:20:18.266 --> 01:20:20.808
Which nobody can deny

01:20:22.516 --> 01:20:25.434
Let me pray, let me pray.

01:20:33.808 --> 01:20:36.767
Hope he didn't spit on the cake.

01:20:36.809 --> 01:20:38.892
Come on.
Open up your presents.

01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:44.059
No, no, please.
Everyone, I want to make some toast.

01:20:46.518 --> 01:20:49.270
- Happy birthday, Burt.
- Salute.

01:20:50.937 --> 01:20:53.354
Buddy Burt.
Salvatore.

01:20:53.438 --> 01:20:57.479
I want to thank Salvatore
for taking me into his life...

01:20:57.563 --> 01:21:00.812
and introducing me
to all you wonderful people.

01:21:05.063 --> 01:21:06.980
Hold on a moment.

01:21:08.896 --> 01:21:10.814
Where is he going?

01:21:42.566 --> 01:21:47.190
I know I never done the right thing,
I never say the right thing...

01:21:47.274 --> 01:21:49.357
and I act like a fool.

01:21:52.609 --> 01:21:56.191
I know I say
we're just buddy-buddy friends...

01:21:56.275 --> 01:21:59.233
but that would not be true
to my heart.

01:22:00.901 --> 01:22:03.525
So I would ask you
this one question.

01:22:03.609 --> 01:22:05.526
And if you answer no...

01:22:07.568 --> 01:22:10.526
then I will leave you alone
once and for all.

01:22:15.610 --> 01:22:18.152
Be my wife, Mary Fiore...

01:22:19.903 --> 01:22:25.320
and I will take care of you
and be true to you...

01:22:25.361 --> 01:22:29.028
and, like this house
I built for your dolls...

01:22:29.111 --> 01:22:33.236
I will make sure you have
a strong roof over your head.

01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:36.196
If your answer is yes...

01:22:36.237 --> 01:22:39.820
then no one will ever love you
as much as I love you.

01:22:41.570 --> 01:22:43.528
If your answer is yes...

01:22:45.487 --> 01:22:48.945
you will make me
the happiest man on the Earth.

01:25:36.667 --> 01:25:38.626
What would I have done
without you?

01:25:38.667 --> 01:25:41.459
Hey, wedding woman,
you did some job.

01:25:41.542 --> 01:25:44.833
My girl's gonna knock 'em dead.
Aren't you, sluggo?

01:25:44.917 --> 01:25:48.834
Well, somebody stole my lucky mike.
I can't sing without my lucky mike.

01:26:27.714 --> 01:26:29.297
What are you doing here?

01:26:29.381 --> 01:26:32.507
You know it's bad luck
to see the bride before the wedding.

01:26:35.757 --> 01:26:37.007
You look beautiful.

01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:41.423
Go on. Get out of here.
We're starting any minute.

01:26:41.507 --> 01:26:42.924
Come on.

01:26:44.298 --> 01:26:47.383
- Let's take a walk.
- A walk?

01:26:47.466 --> 01:26:49.841
A walk. Come on.

01:26:49.925 --> 01:26:51.341
Come on.

01:26:53.591 --> 01:26:56.175
No. What are you talking about?
You cannot give the whole wedding to me.

01:26:56.258 --> 01:26:59.050
Everything is gonna be fine.
It's a no-brainer.

01:26:59.133 --> 01:27:01.008
You can't do this.
Geri's out there!

01:27:01.050 --> 01:27:04.051
So?
The whole commission is yours.

01:27:05.759 --> 01:27:07.343
That's more money
than I make in a year.

01:27:07.425 --> 01:27:11.301
Then I guess that means we're gonna
have to go shopping next week.

01:27:13.259 --> 01:27:16.259
I am completely confused.
Why are you doing this?

01:27:17.802 --> 01:27:18.885
Because there's somewhere
I've gotta be.

01:27:19.969 --> 01:27:22.843
Okay, we can talk
afterthe wedding.

01:27:22.927 --> 01:27:24.927
Hang on a minute, Fran.

01:27:27.344 --> 01:27:31.428
- Why do you wanna marry me?
- What?

01:27:31.512 --> 01:27:33.678
That's one of the questions
I need answered.

01:27:35.220 --> 01:27:36.886
Steve, you're scaring me.

01:27:38.053 --> 01:27:39.512
You never call me Steve.

01:27:40.262 --> 01:27:41.761
That's because you don't like it.

01:27:44.136 --> 01:27:46.096
I never said I didn't like it.

01:27:48.638 --> 01:27:51.680
- Okay, where is this going?
- Why do you wanna marry me?

01:27:53.971 --> 01:27:55.971
Are you kidding me?

01:27:56.012 --> 01:27:57.971
- Are you kidding me?
- No, I'm not.

01:27:58.012 --> 01:28:01.639
You're trying to dump me
on the day of my wedding.

01:28:01.681 --> 01:28:04.930
- I just need to know your answer.
- This is not happening to me.

01:28:05.013 --> 01:28:07.514
- Franny, Franny.
- This is... don't "Franny" me!

01:28:07.597 --> 01:28:10.180
don't "Franny" me,
you selfish bastard!

01:28:10.264 --> 01:28:13.055
The reasons we were together in college
don't hold up anymore.

01:28:13.138 --> 01:28:15.097
We're different people now.

01:28:15.138 --> 01:28:17.682
- And?
- And I think you know that.

01:28:19.014 --> 01:28:20.931
Listen to me.

01:28:21.014 --> 01:28:24.014
If you really love me,
I'll put this cummerbund on right now...

01:28:24.098 --> 01:28:27.473
we'll walk up that hill
and go to the big tent and do it.

01:28:27.515 --> 01:28:30.223
- You would do that?
- Yes, I would.

01:28:32.849 --> 01:28:34.683
All those people.

01:28:34.766 --> 01:28:37.307
You don't know half of'em.

01:28:38.891 --> 01:28:40.808
You and me.

01:28:42.558 --> 01:28:43.975
Are you ready?

01:28:47.225 --> 01:28:50.141
Yes. Yes, of course.

01:28:53.600 --> 01:28:55.809
I just need a second.

01:29:03.560 --> 01:29:04.977
Oh, God.

01:29:27.270 --> 01:29:30.187
I don't want to get married.

01:30:21.982 --> 01:30:24.898
How did we let it get this far?

01:30:26.399 --> 01:30:27.898
I don't know.

01:30:29.149 --> 01:30:31.233
What are we gonna do?

01:30:33.233 --> 01:30:36.233
Well, that's the beauty of it.

01:30:36.316 --> 01:30:38.275
Whatever we want.

01:30:41.442 --> 01:30:45.609
I haven't thought about
what I really want in so long.

01:30:45.693 --> 01:30:47.109
Me neither.

01:30:55.860 --> 01:30:58.359
There you go.

01:31:04.069 --> 01:31:05.152
Okay.

01:31:06.777 --> 01:31:08.944
Okay.

01:31:19.697 --> 01:31:22.947
That is the bride.
Is that the bride?

01:31:23.030 --> 01:31:24.822
Yes, it is.

01:31:24.864 --> 01:31:27.280
Well, is she coming back?

01:31:31.157 --> 01:31:34.906
I think all the blood is rushing
to my head and I'm gonna faint.

01:31:34.948 --> 01:31:37.448
I'm gonna kill Mary
for leaving me all alone here.

01:31:37.489 --> 01:31:39.489
- I don't know what to do.
- Penny, take a breath.

01:31:39.573 --> 01:31:41.656
What are you talking about?

01:31:41.740 --> 01:31:44.824
I'm talking about your wedding planner
leaving me here all alone...

01:31:44.907 --> 01:31:47.074
to go to city hall
and get married.

01:31:47.158 --> 01:31:49.074
Married?

01:31:49.158 --> 01:31:51.824
- What? Mary's getting married?
- Yeah, married.

01:31:51.907 --> 01:31:54.366
- You know, married?
- No, she can't get married.

01:31:54.408 --> 01:31:56.366
- Married.
- Hey, hey, city hall.

01:31:56.408 --> 01:31:59.867
Married, you know, like what
you're supposed to be doing.

01:31:59.908 --> 01:32:02.658
Oh, that's... Yeah.

01:32:02.742 --> 01:32:07.034
That's great. Go. I'll tell everyone.
I'll tell Kathie Lee Gifford.

01:32:12.992 --> 01:32:15.201
Beautiful.

01:32:15.285 --> 01:32:16.826
Thanks.

01:32:50.620 --> 01:32:52.746
Come on! Goddamn it.

01:32:52.829 --> 01:32:55.245
Are you sure you
don't know a shortcut?

01:32:55.329 --> 01:32:57.579
Take a shortcut somewhere?

01:32:57.662 --> 01:32:59.580
- What do you expect me...
- Bullshit.

01:32:59.663 --> 01:33:01.872
What are you doing?

01:33:03.663 --> 01:33:06.371
Hold on the right. Hold!

01:33:16.623 --> 01:33:19.873
We are gathered together
in the presence of these witnesses...

01:33:19.956 --> 01:33:23.372
tojoin this man and this woman...

01:33:23.456 --> 01:33:25.456
in matrimony.

01:33:25.497 --> 01:33:28.290
This contract is not
to be taken lightly...

01:33:28.332 --> 01:33:32.082
but thought fully and seriously...

01:33:32.165 --> 01:33:34.540
with a deep realization...

01:33:34.582 --> 01:33:39.082
of its obligations
and responsibilities.

01:33:39.166 --> 01:33:41.124
If anyone can show just cause...

01:33:41.206 --> 01:33:45.374
why these two should not
be joined together in matrimony...

01:33:45.416 --> 01:33:47.958
then let him speak now
or forever...

01:33:48.042 --> 01:33:49.958
hold his peace.

01:33:55.333 --> 01:33:57.459
Fine.

01:33:57.542 --> 01:34:00.168
- Then let us proceed.
- No.

01:34:01.168 --> 01:34:03.792
- Thank God.
- Oh, hell, I object too.

01:34:03.834 --> 01:34:05.168
What is going on here?

01:34:07.542 --> 01:34:08.626
Here we go.

01:34:13.002 --> 01:34:16.919
Maria, I look in your eyes
and it hurts my insides.

01:34:17.002 --> 01:34:20.835
This is not what you want.
This is what I want.

01:34:20.919 --> 01:34:22.585
Shame on me.

01:34:22.627 --> 01:34:24.668
I'm so lucky
to have a father like you.

01:34:26.668 --> 01:34:27.961
But you're right.

01:34:29.420 --> 01:34:32.003
Love isn't like
some enchanted evening...

01:34:33.337 --> 01:34:34.961
isn't a fairy tale...

01:34:35.003 --> 01:34:37.503
or even love at first sight.

01:34:38.836 --> 01:34:41.170
That isn't real life.

01:34:44.213 --> 01:34:46.213
Massimo's a good man.

01:34:46.254 --> 01:34:48.046
don't worry, Papa.

01:34:48.129 --> 01:34:50.879
I know what I'm doing.

01:34:52.754 --> 01:34:54.795
I'm just all grown up now.

01:35:01.380 --> 01:35:03.339
Okay.

01:35:08.672 --> 01:35:10.464
Hey, that's the doc!

01:35:10.506 --> 01:35:12.798
- Steve!
- Oh, yes.

01:35:12.881 --> 01:35:15.048
- You know the doctor?
- Mary. Where's Mary?

01:35:15.131 --> 01:35:17.048
I'm her father.
Who the hell are you?

01:35:17.131 --> 01:35:19.298
- He's the doctor.
- I'm Steve, the doctor.

01:35:19.381 --> 01:35:21.798
- I'm in love with your daughter.
- You are the one?

01:35:21.882 --> 01:35:24.632
- What the hell is going on?
- I'm sorry, but I am.

01:35:24.715 --> 01:35:27.341
- What about Fran?
- Fran and I did not get married.

01:35:27.424 --> 01:35:29.341
That's been happening a lot today.

01:35:29.424 --> 01:35:31.090
Whoa. You didn't get married?

01:35:31.132 --> 01:35:34.716
We're not married. I am not the one.
You are the one, Steve.

01:35:34.799 --> 01:35:37.132
And you didn't get married?
She's not married?

01:35:37.216 --> 01:35:40.758
She does not love me.
She loves you, Steve.

01:35:42.342 --> 01:35:46.509
I could never forgive myself ifever
I got in the way of Mary's true love.

01:35:46.550 --> 01:35:48.884
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm Steve.

01:35:48.967 --> 01:35:50.300
He's Steve. He's the one.

01:35:50.383 --> 01:35:52.342
I'm the doctor.
I'm in love with Mary.

01:35:52.383 --> 01:35:54.342
Wait a minute!
Hold the phone.

01:35:54.425 --> 01:35:58.093
You mean to tell me,
you love her and she loves you...

01:35:58.176 --> 01:36:00.177
and neither of you
got married today?

01:36:00.259 --> 01:36:01.927
That's what I'm saying.

01:36:01.968 --> 01:36:05.010
Then what the hell are you
standing around talking to us for?

01:36:05.093 --> 01:36:08.301
I don't know. Where is she?
Where is Mary? Somebody take me to Mary.

01:36:08.343 --> 01:36:09.843
I take you. Come on.

01:36:09.927 --> 01:36:12.094
- I like him.
- He's a doctor.

01:36:22.761 --> 01:36:24.803
Congratulations!

01:36:24.886 --> 01:36:26.223
Fabulous!

01:36:26.306 --> 01:36:28.264
Good for you!

01:36:30.098 --> 01:36:33.430
- Congratulations!
- Go, go. Thank you.

01:36:56.183 --> 01:36:58.100
Thank you, Massimo!

01:36:58.183 --> 01:37:00.308
You better be good to her!

01:37:00.391 --> 01:37:03.183
I still do more chin-ups than you!

01:37:31.102 --> 01:37:34.060
Why are you only eating
the brown ones?

01:37:43.228 --> 01:37:46.144
Because someone once said that...

01:37:46.228 --> 01:37:50.186
they had less artificial coloring
because chocolate's already brown.

01:37:55.646 --> 01:37:57.729
And it kind of stayed with me.

01:38:03.729 --> 01:38:05.562
You kind of stayed with me.

01:38:14.980 --> 01:38:16.438
Where's Fran?

01:38:17.480 --> 01:38:20.230
She's in Tahiti...

01:38:20.313 --> 01:38:22.230
on our honeymoon.

01:38:25.148 --> 01:38:26.773
We didn't get married.

01:38:31.606 --> 01:38:32.690
Because?

01:38:35.232 --> 01:38:38.481
Because she needs to
find her own life.

01:38:44.358 --> 01:38:46.233
And I...

01:38:48.983 --> 01:38:50.400
You what?

01:38:53.649 --> 01:38:55.234
What does Steve want?

01:38:56.359 --> 01:38:57.984
I want to dance...

01:39:01.984 --> 01:39:03.858
with you.
