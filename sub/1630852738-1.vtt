00:13.320 --> 00:16.080
I think
everyone would love to just meet someone

00:16.160 --> 00:18.000
in a bar or in a grocery store.

00:19.120 --> 00:23.200
But nowadays, the best way
you can meet someone is on a dating app.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.480
You can find
a bit of everything on Tinder.

00:31.360 --> 00:34.360
There are people looking for
long-term relationships or marriage.

00:36.680 --> 00:38.600
People who just want to hook up.

00:40.120 --> 00:41.240
Anything.

00:44.400 --> 00:46.840
You can pick guys from all over the world.

00:48.400 --> 00:49.680
It's a lot of men.

00:50.520 --> 00:53.400
We are all looking for
that diamond in the rough.

00:56.320 --> 01:00.560
And of course, you Google everyone that
you're supposed to go on a date with.

01:08.680 --> 01:12.320
Well, this is gonna be fun.
Let's swipe right on that.

01:20.440 --> 01:26.920
Private jets, cool cars,
amazing parties all over the world.

01:28.440 --> 01:31.160
What happened to me felt like a movie.

01:32.880 --> 01:35.600
But in the movies,
there's always bad guys.

01:38.240 --> 01:40.760
I get these threatening messages.

01:42.760 --> 01:45.960
These enemies were watching me, my family.

01:49.960 --> 01:51.640
It's just been fucking hell.

01:53.120 --> 01:54.360
I'm shit scared.

01:55.280 --> 01:57.920
Are they coming now? Did we lock the door?

01:59.800 --> 02:03.680
I don't think I ever will be
the same again.

02:09.320 --> 02:12.280
One little swipe
can change your life forever.

02:24.960 --> 02:28.320
I think the… I think life is about love,

02:28.400 --> 02:32.000
'cause the most happiest times I've had
is when I've been in love.

02:39.320 --> 02:43.600
That's what's most amazing about love,
no matter how many heartbreaks you've had,

02:43.680 --> 02:44.920
you still go after it.

02:47.680 --> 02:49.680
-I love dating.

02:49.760 --> 02:53.240
The moment I get nervous, then I know
that there's something special here.

02:53.760 --> 02:55.920
And I love being nervous.
That's the thing.

02:57.800 --> 03:01.320
I'm after that all-consuming, the kind of…

03:01.920 --> 03:03.480
What you've grown up with.

03:04.680 --> 03:08.160
The first memories
that I have about love is Disney.

03:17.600 --> 03:20.600
I had memorized the entire
Beauty and the Beast cassette.

03:21.120 --> 03:22.760
I knew all the songs.

03:24.440 --> 03:25.960
I just love Belle.

03:26.720 --> 03:30.400
She is this small-town girl like me,
hoping for something bigger.

03:30.920 --> 03:34.400
She meets this person,
and then she saves him in a sense,

03:34.480 --> 03:38.120
or he saves her as well. Like,
to go into a different life together.

03:40.240 --> 03:44.960
It just sticks with you, like, the feeling
of a prince coming to save you.

03:47.160 --> 03:51.640
And I think that even though you know
it's not real, it's still with you a bit.

03:51.720 --> 03:55.160
I think everyone has
that little bit of hope deep down inside

03:55.240 --> 03:58.440
it will be as magical
as they were portraying it to be.

04:01.880 --> 04:04.320
But finding Prince Charming in real life…

04:04.880 --> 04:05.960
It's a lot of work.

04:08.600 --> 04:11.040
I've been on Tinder for seven years.

04:13.080 --> 04:17.880
I'm from Norway, but live in London.
So I've been on Tinder in two countries.

04:19.240 --> 04:21.040
How many matches
have you had?

04:22.320 --> 04:23.720
Do you really want to see?

04:23.800 --> 04:25.240
-Can we see?
-Yeah.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.240
1,024 matches.

04:28.840 --> 04:32.400
Yeah, I'm a bit of a Tinder expert.
You can say that.

04:34.200 --> 04:37.640
The most important thing that you can
have is a picture of your face,

04:37.720 --> 04:39.600
then you have a picture with friends.

04:39.680 --> 04:42.080
It's important to show
that you're social as well.

04:42.160 --> 04:46.800
Feel my profile showing
I'm not in the hook-up culture.

04:46.880 --> 04:49.200
Like, I'm after long-term love.

04:50.600 --> 04:52.080
For me to swipe right on a guy,

04:52.160 --> 04:54.760
it needs to be
that we have some similar interests

04:54.840 --> 04:56.280
in the pictures I'm looking at.

04:56.360 --> 04:58.800
Maybe like a nice dinner somewhere,

04:58.880 --> 05:02.920
or that you like the beach,
'cause I love a beach.

05:03.840 --> 05:06.000
Oh my God. Um, animals.

05:06.080 --> 05:08.720
A handsome man with a cat?
Like, it can't go wrong.

05:10.600 --> 05:13.320
And you want a guy that has ambition.

05:13.400 --> 05:17.280
It's like Marilyn Monroe in the movie
Gentlemen Prefer Blondes.

05:17.360 --> 05:19.440
And then she has this quote
where she says…

05:19.520 --> 05:23.600
Don't you know that a man being rich
is like a girl being pretty?

05:24.160 --> 05:27.160
You might not marry a girl
just because she's pretty,

05:27.240 --> 05:29.200
but my goodness, doesn't it help?

05:29.720 --> 05:32.920
It is a very true quote.
Like, you want the full package.

05:34.680 --> 05:37.800
But it's not easy to find
what you're looking for.

05:37.880 --> 05:41.160
It's a lot of swiping.
Back and forth, back and forth.

05:50.560 --> 05:54.360
When I saw Simon's pictures,
he had the kind of look that I like.

05:56.920 --> 06:00.920
He was dressed very stylish. I love a guy
in a suit, and he had several of those.

06:01.440 --> 06:04.480
And he had his link to his Instagram.

06:04.560 --> 06:06.000
You always check the Insta.

06:11.800 --> 06:15.320
He had so many pictures
and so many followers.

06:17.560 --> 06:21.960
Business meetings, parties, beaches.

06:24.760 --> 06:29.200
This guy is just having a very different
life than I ever will experience.

06:29.280 --> 06:32.840
And I was just thinking that it would be
kind of cool just to meet up.

06:35.600 --> 06:37.400
I decide to swipe right.

06:42.600 --> 06:45.120
And then he just responds fairly quickly.

06:46.200 --> 06:49.320
"I'm leaving London tomorrow.
Do you want to meet up?"

06:50.440 --> 06:52.720
When we text on WhatsApp,
he asked me to meet him

06:52.800 --> 06:55.240
at the hotel that he was staying at,
the Four Seasons…

06:56.320 --> 07:00.760
…and he just sent the Google Maps link,
so I could know where I was gonna go.

07:04.320 --> 07:07.600
This was just going to be, like,
an hour-long coffee,

07:07.680 --> 07:11.160
'cause I could just sense
that this guy was a busy guy.

07:17.680 --> 07:22.000
When I walk into this really fancy hotel,
I feel out of place.

07:25.600 --> 07:30.200
I think I'm a bit early.
So I just decide to sit down and wait.

07:36.400 --> 07:37.520
You know, you're nervous.

07:42.240 --> 07:44.440
When the elevator door finally pings…

07:46.480 --> 07:48.360
I was like, "Shit."

07:52.360 --> 07:54.800
He looks exactly like his pictures.

07:55.960 --> 07:57.600
He has this magnetism.

07:58.440 --> 08:01.360
There's something about this guy
that is special.

08:06.920 --> 08:09.320
One of the first topics
we talked about was his job.

08:11.040 --> 08:13.200
He's the CEO of LLD Diamonds.

08:16.040 --> 08:17.760
He got the job from his dad.

08:20.080 --> 08:22.720
When he mentioned that his dad
was the king of diamonds,

08:22.800 --> 08:25.400
so that meant that he was
the prince of diamonds,

08:25.480 --> 08:28.920
I realized, like,
"My God, what kind of family is this?"

08:31.440 --> 08:36.880
Very quickly, he'd become very personal.
And that's what I really liked about it.

08:38.160 --> 08:41.640
He has a baby daughter
that turns two in a couple of weeks.

08:42.400 --> 08:44.720
She's there now to visit him in London,

08:44.800 --> 08:47.040
but he's not together with the mom
anymore.

08:47.560 --> 08:51.200
He's rarely in one place
for a very long period of time,

08:51.280 --> 08:53.640
and he just missed having someone,
you know.

08:54.960 --> 08:56.840
When we were nearing the end of the date,

08:56.920 --> 08:59.480
he said, "I really want
to get to know you better."

09:00.000 --> 09:02.720
They were traveling to Bulgaria
for a business trip,

09:02.800 --> 09:06.000
and then he was asking me
if I wanted to join them.

09:06.080 --> 09:07.720
We're traveling by private jet.

09:07.800 --> 09:11.480
"Shit. Ooh, this is something new
that I've never done before."

09:13.280 --> 09:15.920
I felt that I would be stupid
if I said no.

09:16.440 --> 09:19.120
So I was kind of, like,
super excited on the inside,

09:19.200 --> 09:22.880
but on the outside, I kept it very cool,
because I was just thinking,

09:22.960 --> 09:25.920
"Okay, you like this guy,
you just need to keep your cool now."

09:27.760 --> 09:30.920
Simon asked one of his drivers
to take me back home,

09:31.000 --> 09:33.600
so I could pack some stuff,
get my passport,

09:33.680 --> 09:35.000
then they will drive me back.

09:35.880 --> 09:38.400
Suddenly, there's this Rolls-Royce
waiting for me.

09:38.480 --> 09:40.680
So I was kind of like,
"My God. This is insane."

09:41.200 --> 09:42.680
It felt like being in a movie.

09:43.840 --> 09:46.440
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer presents

09:47.040 --> 09:51.320
an exciting, extravagant,
romantic adventure.

09:51.400 --> 09:53.280
The Yellow Rolls-Royce.

09:54.560 --> 09:56.040
I can be quick when I pack.

10:01.840 --> 10:04.160
I have a messenger group
with my girlfriends.

10:08.360 --> 10:09.640
My friends are freaking out.

10:14.800 --> 10:17.880
"Who is this guy? How do you know him?
You can be abducted."

10:17.960 --> 10:22.080
I was like, "Oh, I didn't even think
about that. I'm on a date, you know."

10:28.600 --> 10:32.600
At the airport, there is the entire team
waiting for us.

10:32.680 --> 10:36.040
A really tall guy,
which I presume is the bodyguard.

10:36.120 --> 10:39.720
There's a couple of drivers,
and you have his little daughter.

10:41.200 --> 10:44.240
I see this woman
that's with Simon's daughter.

10:44.320 --> 10:47.200
Simon tells me that
that's the baby's mother

10:47.280 --> 10:49.560
and that they're going to be
on the plane with us.

10:49.640 --> 10:52.920
His ex is joining us
on our first date together,

10:53.000 --> 10:55.840
and I'm kind of like,
"Well, this can be interesting."

10:58.320 --> 11:02.600
Morning. How are you?
Ah, good. Morning.

11:02.680 --> 11:04.880
Did you take videos
on the plane? Show me?

11:04.960 --> 11:08.560
Yes. It's like the worst person.

11:08.640 --> 11:10.680
That's what one of my friends would say.

11:10.760 --> 11:15.000
"Can you stop being so awkward?"
But I was very excited about it, you know.

11:19.840 --> 11:23.520
It was champagne with caviar.
I've never eaten caviar before.

11:23.600 --> 11:28.520
And then it was sushi. And it was like
it was a totally different world.

11:35.800 --> 11:38.640
If I like someone, I'll give them
a little kiss on the cheek.

11:39.440 --> 11:41.720
It was quick,
but it just felt very natural.

11:45.280 --> 11:49.600
When we landed, me and the baby's mother
and the baby, we went into a car.

11:50.720 --> 11:53.760
Of course, I take the opportunity
to ask some questions.

11:54.280 --> 11:56.520
She tells me
what a wonderful father he is,

11:56.600 --> 11:59.880
that he's still supporting them
even though they're not together anymore,

11:59.960 --> 12:02.320
which was really, really nice to hear.

12:07.720 --> 12:09.720
When we go to the hotel, we check in,

12:09.800 --> 12:12.040
and when we're walking
into the elevator together,

12:12.120 --> 12:13.560
exactly when the door closes,

12:13.640 --> 12:15.960
he takes me around the waist
and he just looks at me

12:16.040 --> 12:18.280
and he draws me in
and just gives me this kiss,

12:18.360 --> 12:22.160
and I was like, "Oh, shit," you know,
the kind of butterflies…

12:22.240 --> 12:25.160
It was passionate,
and was just the perfect first kiss

12:25.240 --> 12:26.520
that you could have, you know.

12:36.240 --> 12:38.760
-You sleep together?
-We sleep together.

12:42.240 --> 12:46.280
And then, later on, I could see
that he has some marks on his back.

12:49.640 --> 12:53.040
I was just wondering, like, what is this?
Where, like, I was touching it.

12:53.120 --> 12:55.200
And then he was kind of like, "Oh, well…"

12:55.280 --> 12:57.920
He didn't exactly know how to say it,
but it was, like,

12:58.000 --> 13:02.960
he had been in jail in South Africa.
And I was like, "What?"

13:03.040 --> 13:04.560
Just trust me once more.

13:05.240 --> 13:06.600
Why should I?

13:07.600 --> 13:09.800
He had a deal going on there, and they had

13:10.320 --> 13:12.520
turned their backs against him
and betrayed him.

13:12.600 --> 13:15.920
So he had gone in prison
on false pretenses.

13:16.000 --> 13:16.960
He was innocent.

13:20.400 --> 13:23.680
He had been manhandled in prison
because he was Jewish.

13:26.120 --> 13:28.720
Here was this guy I thought
had everything going for him

13:28.800 --> 13:31.680
sitting on the bed with me,
being really vulnerable.

13:31.760 --> 13:33.000
Just give me the stamps.

13:33.080 --> 13:36.960
Oh. Oh, I love you, Adam, Alex, Peter…

13:37.040 --> 13:40.560
Here's this kind of person
that you want to save,

13:41.120 --> 13:44.680
especially 'cause he has
so much responsibility on his back.

13:44.760 --> 13:46.360
Everyone is relying on him.

13:50.560 --> 13:53.880
Even though things had gone
very quickly with us,

13:53.960 --> 13:57.120
but when I sit there and I feel
an emotional connection with someone

13:57.200 --> 14:00.360
and they're opening up,
that's just how I am as a person.

14:07.200 --> 14:11.720
He starts getting a lot of calls,
and, in the end, he just says,

14:11.800 --> 14:14.320
"We're so busy. I think it's best
if you just go back home."

14:18.280 --> 14:21.000
I was a bit disappointed, actually.
I was kind of like…

14:21.640 --> 14:23.360
I wanted to spend more time with him.

14:29.640 --> 14:32.760
When I came back to London, I thought
the conversation would die out.

14:32.840 --> 14:34.480
I didn't expect anything.

14:36.520 --> 14:39.880
I felt like I knew him more,
but I didn't really "know him" know him.

14:39.960 --> 14:44.920
Like, how special was I? I felt special,
but, like, when he leaves, you never know.

14:49.600 --> 14:52.080
I was hoping. I was really hoping

14:52.160 --> 14:53.840
that he was gonna come back.

15:16.360 --> 15:19.600
But then kept going with, like,
good morning messages to each other

15:19.680 --> 15:22.240
and good night messages, and FaceTime.

15:24.720 --> 15:27.520
He was, like, tagging me
where he was going.

15:30.840 --> 15:33.760
When I was at work, you could hear
the pinging in your phone,

15:33.840 --> 15:35.760
and it was, like, "I hope that it's him."

15:37.280 --> 15:40.320
He just suddenly asked me,
"So what's your address?"

15:44.480 --> 15:47.920
Never, ever received a bouquet like that.

15:54.160 --> 15:57.960
Miss you. Wanna spend some time
together… Kiss you, hug you.

16:00.120 --> 16:03.040
Feel like we have something special,
and he says so to me.

16:03.560 --> 16:06.000
So I'm kind of like,
"Oh, shit. Is this it?"

16:13.880 --> 16:15.560
Ah, it was so nice seeing him again.

16:15.640 --> 16:19.120
I can't even describe to someone.
Like, when you really want to see someone.

16:20.040 --> 16:24.680
Just feeling that you're his girl
is like the best feeling.

16:33.960 --> 16:38.880
But then it was difficult to meet up with
him. He was traveling a lot for business.

16:40.800 --> 16:43.360
I was going home to Oslo
and I was thinking,

16:43.440 --> 16:45.880
"Well, you can come to Oslo!"

16:46.480 --> 16:48.360
And that was one of the things he said,

16:48.440 --> 16:51.920
"But, babe, I don't have anything to do
in Oslo. There's no business,"

16:52.000 --> 16:56.000
and I was missing him so much, I was like,
"I'm never gonna be able to see you."

17:07.200 --> 17:08.280
You're kidding me.

17:08.360 --> 17:12.000
You're such a busy guy,
and you decide to take a private jet

17:12.080 --> 17:14.800
and land at like00 a.m.
to come and see me.

17:16.560 --> 17:21.000
So I go to his hotel. I bought him,
like, a Valentine's present.

17:21.080 --> 17:24.520
It was a book about
having a relationship with a Norwegian.

17:25.880 --> 17:28.000
And then I had made,
like, ten things about him

17:28.080 --> 17:30.360
that makes him wonderful,
which I'd written myself.

17:32.960 --> 17:34.280
And then he just asked me,

17:34.360 --> 17:37.280
"I am serious about you.
Do you want to be my girlfriend?"

17:37.360 --> 17:41.800
And I'm kind of like, "Oh, shit."
The kind of words that you wanted to hear.

17:42.400 --> 17:44.000
Yeah. And then we were together.

17:52.480 --> 17:55.200
That's when he said there was something
he wants to tell me

17:55.280 --> 17:56.520
if we're gonna be together.

17:56.600 --> 17:59.520
It was better to be open and honest
about how his life was

17:59.600 --> 18:01.000
than to keep it hidden.

18:04.160 --> 18:08.560
He was just talking about
this big deal that he needed to get done,

18:09.520 --> 18:12.800
and the deal was worth $70 million,

18:12.880 --> 18:15.480
but the diamond industry
is a dangerous business.

18:18.000 --> 18:21.160
He had these threats
surrounding his security.

18:21.800 --> 18:25.720
He had a security team in Israel.
Peter was like the head of it.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.400
Threats had gotten worse.

18:31.480 --> 18:35.440
He showed me pictures of, like,
they had gotten bullets in the mail.

18:36.520 --> 18:38.320
Funeral flowers had been sent.

18:39.680 --> 18:42.560
He had CCTV of an apartment in Tel Aviv.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.080
He had a break-in there.

18:46.920 --> 18:50.480
The security team told him
that he wasn't safe in London anymore,

18:50.560 --> 18:52.960
and for time being he needed to stay away.

18:55.600 --> 18:58.800
Of course, I get super scared for him.

18:58.880 --> 19:01.640
I could just see
that it was straining on him.

19:04.280 --> 19:07.400
He just wanted my understanding
that things were gonna be fine,

19:07.480 --> 19:09.000
and we were going to be together.

19:11.280 --> 19:14.400
And I was like,
"Okay. I'll be here for you."

19:25.080 --> 19:29.320
When I got back home, one of my friends
Googled the Leviev family.

19:37.520 --> 19:40.280
She says this is
one of the most powerful families.

19:41.600 --> 19:43.520
They've become big for a reason.

19:45.680 --> 19:49.680
Need to be realistic
about what he's involved in.

19:53.280 --> 19:57.920
I hadn't seen him in a while.
And of course it made you a bit scared.

19:59.520 --> 20:02.160
So I check his Tinder to see where he is.

20:03.120 --> 20:05.440
I see that he's in a different country.

20:06.000 --> 20:09.440
And I also see
a couple of his pictures had changed.

20:11.000 --> 20:15.600
My heart just sank, you know,
'cause that means that he's been active.

20:16.200 --> 20:17.040
So what's going on?

20:21.800 --> 20:26.760
I'm not using Tinder anymore.
I deleted the app. I deleted the account.

20:27.360 --> 20:30.600
He tells me that we're a team
and we're together

20:30.680 --> 20:32.840
and that I have nothing to worry about.

20:32.920 --> 20:34.400
There's no one else. Only me.

20:35.560 --> 20:39.560
I care about you. I miss you.
And everything will be all right, baby.

20:47.000 --> 20:50.320
I was sitting by my phone,
swiping, swiping.

20:50.920 --> 20:53.000
What kind of guy
were you hoping for?

20:53.080 --> 20:59.000
An ideal guy. A smart one. And funny.
And very impulsive.

21:01.920 --> 21:05.600
I'm a very independent woman.
I always have been.

21:05.680 --> 21:07.840
I've done that since the age of 16,

21:07.920 --> 21:10.640
so I don't need a man to take care of me,

21:10.720 --> 21:13.920
but I would appreciate
to have a man to share my life.

21:21.800 --> 21:23.560
My Tinder profile was a mix.

21:24.240 --> 21:29.520
It had some pictures
with me dressed for work, traveling,

21:29.600 --> 21:31.840
because I still wanted
to attract this person

21:31.920 --> 21:33.720
that was living the same life as I did.

21:39.720 --> 21:44.120
So I was swiping.
And then this guy comes up.

21:47.080 --> 21:50.040
This is someone who is well-traveled.

21:51.680 --> 21:53.400
And still works very hard.

21:53.480 --> 21:57.360
So I thought,
"Oh, great. Let's swipe right on that."

22:01.360 --> 22:02.640
I got a match.

22:05.840 --> 22:10.240
He was here in Stockholm for business,
but it said he was living in Amsterdam.

22:12.200 --> 22:15.240
He texts me and asks me
if I want to come visit.

22:17.640 --> 22:20.200
There is a flight
tomorrow at nine o'clock in the morning

22:20.280 --> 22:21.760
from Stockholm to Amsterdam.

22:21.840 --> 22:23.560
So tell me if it's all right for you.

22:24.080 --> 22:28.200
He asked about my passport details,
booked my flight ticket,

22:28.280 --> 22:30.000
which I thought was a nice gesture.

22:32.040 --> 22:37.040
I get this confirmation
from Simon Leviev at LLD Diamonds.

22:42.280 --> 22:44.280
Of course, I started to Google,

22:44.360 --> 22:48.360
because you always Google everyone
you're supposed to go on a date with.

22:50.120 --> 22:53.440
His father is this diamond tycoon,

22:54.040 --> 22:57.280
and I'm just thinking,
"Oh my God, another diamond guy."

22:58.960 --> 23:00.920
-Um…
-Another diamond guy?

23:01.000 --> 23:01.880
Yeah.

23:02.920 --> 23:05.880
I used to date a guy
that was in the diamond industry.

23:05.960 --> 23:07.760
Okay, maybe second time around.

23:15.720 --> 23:21.320
I take a car to his house, which is
in this lovely, lovely neighborhood.

23:23.040 --> 23:25.040
He comes and opens up the door.

23:25.800 --> 23:27.760
He dresses very elegantly.

23:27.840 --> 23:31.120
"A little bit short for my taste,"
was the first thing I was thinking,

23:32.280 --> 23:34.360
but he's really easy to talk to.

23:35.920 --> 23:39.960
It's quite rare that you meet someone
and you have this instant connection.

23:40.600 --> 23:42.560
After we spent an hour together,

23:42.640 --> 23:47.240
we felt like we had known each other
for ten years or something.

23:49.960 --> 23:53.800
We go for lunch,
the entire staff welcomes us.

23:54.840 --> 23:59.880
They bring a special order of caviar
that the restaurant uses just for Simon.

24:01.560 --> 24:03.760
I don't think the food
ever stopped coming in.

24:05.840 --> 24:09.160
He really asked a lot of questions,
really wanted to listen,

24:09.240 --> 24:10.800
which I really appreciated.

24:10.880 --> 24:13.600
'Cause it's quite rare
to have men listen sometimes.

24:15.600 --> 24:21.040
Afterwards, we had a nice, long walk
around Amsterdam. I see a diamond museum.

24:23.320 --> 24:27.040
I love museums,
and if you should go to a diamond museum,

24:27.120 --> 24:29.200
you should go
with someone in the business.

24:30.280 --> 24:32.200
He knows all about the mines,

24:32.760 --> 24:35.600
how to cut them,
where you get the best diamonds.

24:36.160 --> 24:37.360
He knows everything.

24:40.960 --> 24:44.200
After that,
he makes this little bit of a move on me.

24:45.240 --> 24:47.160
But it just doesn't feel right.

24:47.240 --> 24:50.720
He's like, "No, maybe no.
Just… Better just stay friends."

24:50.800 --> 24:52.560
"Yeah, maybe you're right."

24:55.480 --> 24:58.880
Even though there wasn't
a romantic energy between us,

24:58.960 --> 25:00.560
I really enjoyed myself.

25:05.800 --> 25:10.680
I actually missed him after just a day
or two, because we did have a lot of fun.

25:20.720 --> 25:23.400
We were talking and calling and texting.

25:24.560 --> 25:26.000
When he's out to dinner,

25:26.080 --> 25:29.520
he sends me a picture,
and we used voice notes.

25:29.600 --> 25:32.160
Beautiful looking.
Beautiful, Pernilla.

25:33.320 --> 25:34.520
Happy to see you tomorrow.

25:34.600 --> 25:37.360
You can be two different types
of personalities sometimes.

25:37.440 --> 25:40.640
So either you can be a battery charger
or a battery drainer.

25:40.720 --> 25:43.520
Work hard, play hard.

25:45.040 --> 25:47.640
And he was definitely my battery charger.

25:47.720 --> 25:50.120
Amazing. Amazing. Beautiful dress.

25:51.000 --> 25:56.400
Once, I remember, like, he flew over
just to have a coffee with me one day

25:56.480 --> 25:58.320
because I was having a bad day.

25:59.400 --> 26:01.680
Pernilla, about 10 o'clock
we're going for a drink.

26:01.760 --> 26:03.480
Then,30, we're going to the club.

26:03.560 --> 26:05.280
Can't wait to see you later!

26:06.440 --> 26:10.000
I gave him a little bit of a prince emoji
next to his name,

26:10.080 --> 26:13.000
because that's how he's behaving
sometimes.

26:13.840 --> 26:15.880
And I always make a joke about this.

26:20.080 --> 26:23.120
Really felt like we had
a special connection.

26:34.400 --> 26:35.840
I can't wait to see you.

26:35.920 --> 26:38.560
I love you with all my heart.
I miss you so much.

26:39.800 --> 26:42.600
Simon was away a lot
on business.

26:42.680 --> 26:45.040
We'd talk and text every single day.

26:45.560 --> 26:48.200
Your girl is finally done with yoga
for the night.

26:48.280 --> 26:52.520
And she's at home
making some delicious salmon.

26:53.400 --> 26:54.680
I felt special.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.200
It was just amazing.

27:00.920 --> 27:02.360
And then, he asked me.

27:12.920 --> 27:15.920
It's just the best feeling, you know,
when you have someone

27:16.000 --> 27:18.440
and both are on the same wavelength.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.000
Time for apartment number two.

27:24.960 --> 27:28.520
Living room where we can
watch movies and stuff.

27:28.600 --> 27:32.880
I was dreaming of how it would be
for the two of us to live together.

27:32.960 --> 27:35.280
And then you have this awesome kitchen.

27:38.240 --> 27:40.760
And here is the bedroom.

27:43.320 --> 27:47.720
Simon tells me that
the budget is $15,000 per month.

27:48.400 --> 27:49.600
Third apartment.

27:49.680 --> 27:52.600
So I'm going all the rounds
in these amazing apartments.

27:52.680 --> 27:55.760
And sometimes I even have
Simon with me on FaceTime.

27:57.840 --> 28:01.240
It was just a really nice way
to connect with him,

28:01.320 --> 28:04.040
even though he wasn't there,
to do it together.

28:04.640 --> 28:07.680
The view is out to the Piazza
at Covent Garden.

28:19.000 --> 28:22.120
Cecilie, my love, I love you, I miss you.
I can't wait to see you.

28:46.280 --> 28:51.240
In the middle of the night, I get
a picture of Peter, Simon's bodyguard.

28:52.360 --> 28:56.760
Simon is writing "Peter hurt,"
and I'm like, "What the fuck?"

29:09.720 --> 29:11.160
Well, this is the night.

29:11.960 --> 29:14.800
Can you write your first name?
Or I can write it, of course.

29:14.880 --> 29:15.960
We're in an ambulance.

29:16.040 --> 29:17.080
Can you write that?

29:17.160 --> 29:20.920
He just says that, "They were
going after me. Thank God for Peter."

29:21.000 --> 29:22.400
"If not, I would be dead."

29:23.800 --> 29:25.160
It's okay, love. It's okay.

29:25.240 --> 29:28.400
I told you, we're in a war.
We need to be strong.

29:29.440 --> 29:32.640
I didn't know what to do.
And he just says, "We're safe now."

29:32.720 --> 29:35.120
"We're being taken care of.
You just need to sleep."

29:37.200 --> 29:39.280
The next morning,
Simon sends me a voice note.

29:39.880 --> 29:43.680
Because of the situation,
with the security and everything,

29:43.760 --> 29:47.160
they told me I'm not allowed
to use my credit card.

29:47.240 --> 29:51.720
He can't use his cards anymore because
the security team has said his enemies

29:51.800 --> 29:56.480
are tracing his spending and where he is
based on his credit card use.

29:56.560 --> 29:58.560
I wanted to ask you a favor.

29:58.640 --> 30:01.800
If you have
an American Express credit card,

30:01.880 --> 30:03.720
I can link it to my account.

30:04.680 --> 30:08.480
He was just wondering
if he could use my cards for some time.

30:08.560 --> 30:10.720
It would just help him a lot.

30:12.040 --> 30:14.880
It's just temporary,
like, for, uh,

30:14.960 --> 30:16.320
two weeks or something.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.200
I'm his girlfriend.

30:18.280 --> 30:22.200
Of course he would ask me.
Like, you trust me and I trust you,

30:22.280 --> 30:25.880
so of course we're gonna help each other.
It wasn't even a question.

30:35.280 --> 30:39.920
The Platinum Amex is in my name, and he
starts using it as he said he would,

30:40.000 --> 30:42.440
but he maxes out quite quickly.

30:42.520 --> 30:46.720
So he makes payment directly to Amex,
and I get the receipt from him,

30:46.800 --> 30:50.280
and he says that the money is on the way,
but in the meantime,

30:50.360 --> 30:55.640
he wants me to come to Amsterdam
and bring some cash to him. $25,000.

31:04.200 --> 31:08.280
How on Earth am I going to
get that amount of cash?

31:15.080 --> 31:19.560
I took out a loan,
which I then took out in cash.

31:20.800 --> 31:24.720
I was super scared
having that amount of cash in my bag.

31:26.400 --> 31:28.320
Especially when we went through security.

31:30.520 --> 31:32.080
I was super stressed.

31:36.760 --> 31:41.000
How was I gonna explain the money
if I got any questions about it?

31:47.280 --> 31:51.240
The moment I'm with him, I feel safe.
My biggest issue was being apart from him.

31:54.120 --> 31:56.040
He was really grateful.

31:57.080 --> 32:00.520
He told me that everything I was doing
is keeping him safe.

32:05.000 --> 32:08.600
But within hours, the security team
said there was a problem.

32:10.760 --> 32:13.840
He deletes his Instagram
because of security measures,

32:13.920 --> 32:17.440
and then he asked me
to make my account private.

32:17.520 --> 32:19.080
Take it all away.

32:19.160 --> 32:22.080
He says that they can come
and get me through him.

32:22.800 --> 32:25.360
Of course, I get paranoid.
What the fuck is going on?

32:29.440 --> 32:31.240
Later on, Simon gets a call.

32:32.480 --> 32:35.160
He puts Peter on the speakerphone,
and he says,

32:35.240 --> 32:39.160
"Simon, there's been a security breach.
They know where you are."

32:39.240 --> 32:42.840
"The plane is ready to leave.
I can't tell you where you're going."

32:43.840 --> 32:47.920
Peter is asking if he can please
turn off the lights in the apartment.

32:51.880 --> 32:56.320
I'm shit scared. Are they coming now?
Did we lock the door?

33:01.160 --> 33:04.240
Just seeing someone
that you care so much for in danger,

33:04.320 --> 33:07.320
and, like, you can see that
he was not doing well mentally.

33:07.400 --> 33:09.480
I could see
that he was struggling so much.

33:09.560 --> 33:12.040
And in the end,
he just told me that he had to go.

33:18.000 --> 33:22.320
When he lands, he sends me the geotag.
He's landed in Stockholm.

33:31.120 --> 33:34.160
He is here. Very spontaneous.

33:35.320 --> 33:36.560
So I ask him…

33:47.040 --> 33:50.160
The club is basically an ocean with women,

33:50.240 --> 33:52.880
or as I call them, champagne girls.

33:53.680 --> 33:55.440
They are basically like flies.

33:55.520 --> 33:58.160
Like, you put out a rotten banana,
and they just attack,

33:58.240 --> 34:01.720
but these girls do the same thing
when they see a bottle of champagne.

34:03.400 --> 34:07.600
And Simon is of course
paying for this entire circus.

34:08.720 --> 34:13.120
He's paying with cash and just making sure
that everyone is having a good time.

34:13.920 --> 34:17.720
All of them are quite drunk,
especially Simon's bodyguard, Peter.

34:18.800 --> 34:21.880
This is not an environment
that I want to be in.

34:22.760 --> 34:27.320
So I just stay for 10, 15 minutes
and then just say,

34:27.400 --> 34:29.920
"Let's talk tomorrow
and enjoy your night and have fun."

34:41.800 --> 34:44.840
The morning after, I text him
and ask how the hangover is

34:44.920 --> 34:47.800
and maybe if he needs a cup of coffee,
we should go for one,

34:48.400 --> 34:49.760
and then he texts me back.

34:52.080 --> 34:53.400
He's already in Spain.

35:07.800 --> 35:09.160
The Amex card is in my name.

35:15.320 --> 35:17.120
Welcome to American Express.

35:17.200 --> 35:21.400
So I had to pretend that I was the one
traveling around, you know.

35:21.480 --> 35:23.680
I understand your card isn't working.

35:23.760 --> 35:27.000
I'll connect you with someone
who can assist. Say or enter…

35:27.080 --> 35:30.760
I needed to know exactly the amount that
he was spending, which hotel he was in,

35:32.120 --> 35:34.720
so they would believe
that I was the one using the card.

35:35.320 --> 35:37.120
We need to go. We need to travel.

35:37.200 --> 35:39.680
It's making things
very complicated, honey.

35:44.080 --> 35:47.320
Couple of hours later he would call again,
and it's blocked again.

35:48.240 --> 35:50.360
Welcome to American Express.

35:50.440 --> 35:51.880
Then I need to call Amex,

35:51.960 --> 35:54.560
and Simon had already told me
that this would happen,

35:54.640 --> 35:57.800
that it would be something
that I would need to do at the start

35:57.880 --> 35:59.280
to call them and fix this.

36:01.840 --> 36:04.480
The other problem
was that the credit limit wasn't enough.

36:05.560 --> 36:09.680
We had to get it up so he could spend it,
'cause he had an entire team, you know.

36:09.760 --> 36:13.240
So I was like,
"Okay, but how are you going to do that?"

36:13.320 --> 36:14.880
He said, "Well, I can employ you."

36:18.640 --> 36:23.520
He then calls someone in LLD Diamonds
and asks for my passport details,

36:23.600 --> 36:26.520
so I can be put
into the employment registry.

36:30.520 --> 36:33.760
I just tried to say,
"Well, I am not really working there."

36:33.840 --> 36:38.120
He's like, "Well, you are. I'm the CEO.
If they call, you are employed."

36:39.760 --> 36:44.200
I would never ask you for anything
if it was not serious shit.

36:44.280 --> 36:45.880
All these security issues,

36:45.960 --> 36:48.520
you've always been there for me,
so thank you, my love.

36:49.120 --> 36:52.760
We were in a crisis at this point.
Like, what else are we gonna do?

36:54.400 --> 36:57.440
So then I got employed. I got pay slips.

36:58.400 --> 37:00.120
-How much?
-Earning so much.

37:00.200 --> 37:04.360
I think it was, like, $94,000 per month.

37:07.200 --> 37:10.280
I send this over
to prove that I earn much more.

37:10.360 --> 37:12.840
That makes them
raise the credit limit like this.

37:12.920 --> 37:14.880
Of course, you are a bit worried,

37:16.000 --> 37:18.960
but he sends me
a receipt from Credit Suisse

37:19.040 --> 37:21.200
where he's making a transfer
directly to me.

37:22.120 --> 37:24.160
It's for $250,000.

37:24.680 --> 37:28.520
It's more than enough to pay
for the amount that he was spending.

37:43.480 --> 37:45.960
Mykonos is like
a perfect playground.

37:46.040 --> 37:52.240
You will see a lot of yachts,
a lot of celebrities, a lot of models.

37:53.560 --> 37:57.280
You pack all your bikinis, definitely,
for the daytime parties as well.

37:58.600 --> 38:01.200
I am on the phone with Simon,

38:01.280 --> 38:04.480
and he tells me
he has just met his new girlfriend.

38:05.720 --> 38:06.600
Polina.

38:13.000 --> 38:17.920
I tell him they should meet us in Mykonos,
and he does.

38:22.280 --> 38:25.640
I was going to Oslo.
To see my friends, see my family.

38:25.720 --> 38:27.840
And I really wanted to introduce him.

38:30.600 --> 38:33.560
I'm just waiting for him.
He said he was gonna come the next day.

38:34.640 --> 38:36.800
I meet Polina
for the first time.

38:37.960 --> 38:43.480
She's this typical, like, Russian model.
Quite young. But she's very down to earth.

38:43.560 --> 38:44.920
And I really liked her.

38:45.440 --> 38:49.680
He seems very smitten over her.
They seemed like a good match.

38:52.160 --> 38:54.440
Look, I cannot come right now.
I cannot.

38:54.520 --> 38:57.320
The security team had told him,
"You need to stay away."

38:58.000 --> 39:00.160
I felt deeply disappointed.

39:00.920 --> 39:03.840
But what's most important
is actually to keep him safe.

39:08.080 --> 39:10.720
Of course
he had booked the grand suite,

39:10.800 --> 39:12.360
with own private pool.

39:14.520 --> 39:19.480
It's about $5,000 a night, this room.
It's absolutely gorgeous.

39:20.560 --> 39:22.400
I know
you hate to ring up the bank,

39:22.480 --> 39:24.480
but sometimes it is necessary.

39:25.000 --> 39:28.120
I need to book some tickets
for the rest of the team.

39:29.160 --> 39:32.760
Suddenly need to get
so much money for this entire team

39:32.840 --> 39:36.600
that is traveling business class,
that is having expensive dinners.

39:36.680 --> 39:41.440
Like, they're going out with clients,
and the spend is to another level

39:41.520 --> 39:44.000
that you have never, ever seen before.

39:44.080 --> 39:47.800
This is what I do all the time.
Just meetings and more meetings.

39:50.160 --> 39:55.800
$20,000 is a lot of money,
and that was spent in three days.

40:02.680 --> 40:04.880
Simon asks, "Where should we go now?"

40:07.520 --> 40:13.200
We decide to go to Bonbonniere,
also known as the billionaire's club.

40:14.720 --> 40:17.280
You don't get in here
without paying for a table,

40:17.360 --> 40:19.520
which is normally $2,000.

40:20.640 --> 40:24.400
For people here, this is peanuts for them.
This is coffee money.

40:26.040 --> 40:28.200
He maxes out
the credit card again.

40:28.280 --> 40:30.560
So he told me to get more loans.

40:35.360 --> 40:37.120
Don't worry,
I will finish this deal.

40:37.200 --> 40:38.600
Champagne's on me.

40:39.240 --> 40:42.040
Simon orders in
a couple of bottles of champagne.

40:42.120 --> 40:44.800
Before we even have time
to try and chip in,

40:44.880 --> 40:46.840
he has already paid for the bill.

40:47.440 --> 40:48.920
Simon is very generous.

40:55.440 --> 40:58.600
I take out a loan for $40,000.

41:00.000 --> 41:04.280
Simon and Polina
were continuing their little summer tour.

41:04.360 --> 41:06.840
I tried to do,
like, another transaction,

41:06.920 --> 41:08.720
and it didn't go through.

41:08.800 --> 41:11.840
Every second or third day
is a new request.

41:14.160 --> 41:19.440
France, and then they were going Vienna.
They were going Switzerland.

41:19.520 --> 41:23.920
Almost there.
I'm 97% done with the deals.

41:24.000 --> 41:27.440
Each time he maxes out the card,
I have to take out a new loan.

41:28.400 --> 41:34.760
$50,000 Instabank. $12,500 DNB.
$10,000 for a credit card.

41:35.960 --> 41:39.640
"Let's meet up in Rome.
We need to go and see the Coliseum."

41:41.320 --> 41:42.520
Hello.

41:44.120 --> 41:45.000
Hello.

41:46.560 --> 41:48.640
This amazing
Rolls-Royce Phantom

41:48.720 --> 41:51.400
is taking us around all the famous sites,

41:51.480 --> 41:53.920
like the Spanish Stairs, the Coliseum,

41:54.000 --> 41:56.600
the Trevi Fountain to throw a few pennies.

41:56.680 --> 42:00.400
I definitely need some more luck in my
life. Let's see if this can sort it out.

42:02.120 --> 42:04.200
Check what is going on
with the card.

42:04.280 --> 42:05.480
Now. It's important.

42:06.720 --> 42:09.680
Money he had promised me
still hasn't come into my account.

42:12.360 --> 42:15.880
I've already done it
so it doesn't matter right now.

42:15.960 --> 42:18.880
We need a solution right now
for the current situation.

42:18.960 --> 42:22.520
It's kind of like a pressure
that I have never experienced before

42:22.600 --> 42:25.560
to have someone's life
depending on what you're doing.

42:25.640 --> 42:28.360
You know,
I'm facing security threats

42:28.440 --> 42:30.400
with people trying to kill me.

42:31.440 --> 42:36.040
If he couldn't use the card, if something
went wrong, he could be in danger.

42:36.120 --> 42:38.760
And if I didn't help him,
what might happen?

42:44.600 --> 42:45.560
Morning.

42:45.640 --> 42:48.880
The things you're doing for me,
the things we're going through together,

42:48.960 --> 42:50.840
it's for life.

42:50.920 --> 42:53.640
This is what is making me see
that you are the one.

42:54.160 --> 42:57.480
$20,000, Monobank. $15,000, Nordea.

42:58.000 --> 42:59.640
We all give each other
a big hug

42:59.720 --> 43:02.080
and say that we should meet again soon,

43:02.160 --> 43:05.160
after just like an amazing summer, really.

43:10.160 --> 43:11.680
How much had you taken?

43:12.360 --> 43:15.680
$250,000. That's not what I signed up for.

43:23.600 --> 43:25.320
-A lot.
-It is a lot of money.

43:30.680 --> 43:33.800
I know
you have done, uh, too much,

43:34.760 --> 43:36.520
for me, for us, for everything.

43:36.600 --> 43:38.920
I know you're tired
and you want to be together,

43:39.000 --> 43:40.680
which, of course, I do want as well.

43:40.760 --> 43:42.720
I understand.
Everything will be all right.

43:43.240 --> 43:50.040
I was getting so tired and annoyed
and I just needed some kind of money.

43:50.120 --> 43:54.640
That's when he says, "You can come
to Amsterdam and I can give you a check."

44:06.240 --> 44:09.240
He seemed colder.
Wasn't the same kind of affection.

44:09.800 --> 44:15.440
There was almost a cloud across his eyes
that I couldn't pierce through.

44:17.160 --> 44:20.680
When we get into the apartment,
the check is already there.

44:22.840 --> 44:25.520
The check is worth much more
than the debt I have now.

44:28.840 --> 44:34.040
We're trying to be together.
But I can just feel a distance.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.360
It wasn't a good night.

44:49.280 --> 44:52.960
The first thing I do when I come back
from Amsterdam is cash this check.

44:55.800 --> 44:58.600
I really needed that check to go through.

45:00.320 --> 45:02.480
I had eight, nine creditors, you know.

45:02.560 --> 45:06.200
That's a lot of emails
coming down on you at the same time.

45:15.640 --> 45:18.120
I check my bank account every single day.

45:25.920 --> 45:30.280
When four days have passed,
I just know that I need to call the bank.

45:34.680 --> 45:36.200
How can I help you today?

45:36.280 --> 45:37.680
She says, "We won't cash it."

45:39.760 --> 45:41.480
And she couldn't tell me why.

45:41.560 --> 45:45.320
And that's when I was just standing
on the phone, like,

45:45.400 --> 45:47.480
feeling that I had hard to breathe.

45:57.640 --> 45:59.360
Cecilie, I don't understand.
We have…

45:59.440 --> 46:02.000
I was asking about the check,
like, "It didn't work."

46:02.080 --> 46:05.000
He says, "Well, fuck it.
I gave you the money, so…"

46:05.840 --> 46:06.920
"I did my deal."

46:07.000 --> 46:09.080
I already done it.

46:09.160 --> 46:11.400
Never hear him so cold
in my life.

46:12.880 --> 46:16.520
It was like that person on the phone
was no longer my boyfriend.

46:17.040 --> 46:18.680
Was no longer my boyfriend.

46:20.400 --> 46:24.040
I… It was just a, uh… just a darkness.

46:35.560 --> 46:36.880
I know I was in deep shit.

46:41.120 --> 46:44.440
Like, what do you do
when you have nine creditors on you?

46:46.560 --> 46:48.440
I called the Amex helpline.

46:49.600 --> 46:51.520
They can hear how stressed I am.

46:52.640 --> 46:54.880
They just said,
"Stay put. We will come to you."

46:59.160 --> 47:01.840
I was shit scared
they were gonna come and handcuff me

47:01.920 --> 47:02.920
and take me away.

47:04.160 --> 47:05.600
The documents that I sent over.

47:07.640 --> 47:09.480
The lies I told on the phone.

47:11.120 --> 47:12.400
I gave him my card.

47:18.040 --> 47:19.320
I tell them everything.

47:23.280 --> 47:26.440
They said, "Do you have a picture of him?"

47:33.680 --> 47:36.840
That moment when they look at each other
and they say that's the guy.

47:38.280 --> 47:39.680
Fuck. Shit. You know?

47:41.280 --> 47:45.320
"What kind of name did he use?"
And then I said Simon Leviev.

47:45.400 --> 47:49.680
And they said, "Well, that's
one of many names that he's been using."

47:50.520 --> 47:51.560
"Many names"?

47:52.960 --> 47:55.520
Who is this guy
I've been sharing the same bed with?

47:56.600 --> 47:59.000
"He's a professional.
He does this for a living."

48:01.680 --> 48:02.800
Everything's a lie.

48:03.880 --> 48:08.040
He's not a prince of diamonds.
He's not the son of a billionaire.

48:08.720 --> 48:10.840
The man I loved was never real.

48:11.880 --> 48:13.680
He faked everything.

48:19.640 --> 48:21.160
It was horrible, you know.

48:23.000 --> 48:24.040
'Cause I still…

48:25.680 --> 48:27.920
In a sense, I still loved him, you know?

48:28.440 --> 48:32.280
Or the person I thought that he was.
Like, you know everything is a lie,

48:32.800 --> 48:36.280
but then you still have this fairy tale
that's going on, on your phone.

48:36.360 --> 48:40.320
Simon, with still the heart behind it,
'cause I couldn't remove it.

48:41.560 --> 48:43.800
'Cause I still wanted him to be true.

48:47.120 --> 48:50.240
I don't understand
how someone can be so fucking evil.

48:51.560 --> 48:52.920
I felt that he knew me.

48:58.840 --> 49:01.800
The minute they're gone,
I want to speak to my mom.

49:05.360 --> 49:08.560
She just told me,
"You need to get back home to Norway."

49:08.640 --> 49:10.080
"I need you to be with me."

49:15.920 --> 49:19.680
I was going through the messages
in the text.

49:19.760 --> 49:22.960
I was still asking,
"When are we going to fix the money?"

49:23.480 --> 49:26.880
The last messages between the two of us
is like, "I'm working on it."

49:31.960 --> 49:33.200
And then I blocked him.

49:37.440 --> 49:38.840
There was nothing else to say.

49:52.560 --> 49:55.240
That's when I remember
he has my mom's number.

50:00.880 --> 50:04.040
Hey, you blocked me,
I don't know what is your reason.

50:04.120 --> 50:07.120
I'm trying to reach you.
You don't want to talk anyway.

50:07.200 --> 50:09.560
I want to tell you something.
Take my advice.

50:10.080 --> 50:11.160
Just watch out.

50:11.840 --> 50:14.520
Because with every action
there will be a reaction.

50:18.280 --> 50:19.560
I got super scared.

50:21.080 --> 50:22.920
But my mom got even more scared.

50:28.960 --> 50:32.320
We call the police in Norway,
because he knows everything about me.

50:33.400 --> 50:36.960
He has all my passport details, where I
was living, where my mom is living.

50:37.040 --> 50:40.200
He's spoken to her on the phone.
He knows where I am.

50:42.400 --> 50:44.480
But the police didn't seem to care.

50:46.320 --> 50:49.000
I don't know what he is capable of.

50:59.400 --> 51:01.720
I've been on the edge for several days.

51:04.880 --> 51:09.120
I had all these creditors.
I had to let them know, each one of them.

51:09.200 --> 51:12.560
It wasn't just two banks.
There were, like, nine of them.

51:16.760 --> 51:21.920
For this kind of loan, the interest is so
high, that they would just eat me alive.

51:22.800 --> 51:24.360
I felt that I was just drowning.

51:24.440 --> 51:27.040
It was like someone was
just dragging me to the bottom.

51:32.600 --> 51:36.720
I was driving down this road,
and I saw a trailer coming towards me,

51:36.800 --> 51:37.920
and I was thinking…

51:39.840 --> 51:43.400
"What if I just
take the car over," you know?

51:43.480 --> 51:46.880
And just hit…
just hit the trailer, you know?

51:46.960 --> 51:50.640
Then at least it's done, you know?
And that's when I got scared.

51:52.720 --> 51:54.440
That's when I got really scared.

51:55.560 --> 51:58.800
I put myself into a psychiatric ward
because I didn't know what to do.

52:10.200 --> 52:14.280
I was at home, and I could see
the phone started flashing.

52:14.840 --> 52:19.200
I see it's Simon,
and he has sent me news articles.

52:23.840 --> 52:28.120
Simon's father is gonna be
questioned by the police

52:28.200 --> 52:31.360
in a big diamond smuggling case.

52:32.160 --> 52:37.200
Members of Simon's family
have gotten arrested. Russia is involved.

52:38.760 --> 52:40.840
-I give him a call.

52:40.920 --> 52:42.080
That sounds really scary…

52:42.160 --> 52:44.440
He sounds all over the place.

52:45.280 --> 52:49.800
He says police went in. They have
shut down all accounts, all credit cards.

52:50.720 --> 52:54.800
One girl in the office literally jumped
from the building and killed herself.

52:56.240 --> 53:00.240
But Simon says he doesn't believe
that this lady jumped off a building.

53:00.320 --> 53:03.160
He believes that someone went in
and threw her out.

53:03.240 --> 53:05.720
We don't have the options,
you know, the…

53:05.800 --> 53:09.480
And I'm getting so scared.
I'm like, "What is really going on?"

53:09.560 --> 53:13.840
And he says that the security situation
right now is really bad.

53:14.440 --> 53:16.520
I have the worst night in my life.

53:18.160 --> 53:21.200
A few days later,
I can feel my phone buzzing.

53:22.520 --> 53:24.640
Simon is sending a lot of messages.

53:27.680 --> 53:31.040
Oh, my God, what happened last night?

53:31.120 --> 53:33.640
Someone tried to stab me, and

53:33.720 --> 53:35.520
so Peter broke his hand.

53:35.600 --> 53:37.680
Jesus.
What do you mean tried to stab you?

53:37.760 --> 53:39.120
What is going on?

53:40.480 --> 53:42.760
Simon said,
"This is my enemies behind this."

53:42.840 --> 53:46.440
He was really concerned
that someone was after him.

53:49.720 --> 53:51.800
And then I get a voice note from him.

53:51.880 --> 53:55.200
I want to ask you, uh, a favor.

53:56.160 --> 53:59.160
"Pernilla, I am really embarrassed
to even ask you."

53:59.240 --> 54:01.760
"Would it be possible
for me to borrow $30,000?"

54:07.360 --> 54:10.840
It would be a huge, huge, huge,
huge, huge, huge help.

54:11.520 --> 54:14.800
Please let me know if you can
do something. Thank you so much.

54:15.400 --> 54:18.120
I didn't have $30,000 to spare.

54:18.200 --> 54:20.400
I'd been at my mom's now for three months.

54:20.480 --> 54:22.080
I had my savings

54:22.160 --> 54:26.280
that was gonna go to buy myself a new
apartment where I'm supposed to live.

54:26.360 --> 54:28.160
But, what is more important,

54:28.240 --> 54:32.920
my friend's security situation
or me buying an apartment?

54:41.200 --> 54:42.960
Thank you
for everything you've done…

54:43.040 --> 54:46.920
And I make a bank transfer
while I'm on the phone with him.

54:47.000 --> 54:50.760
He's really grateful to have such a good
friend as me that he really can trust.

54:57.960 --> 55:01.040
I was laying in bed
at the psychiatric ward, on my phone,

55:01.560 --> 55:04.720
going through more details
with the people that I had met.

55:07.240 --> 55:09.880
I knew that Simon was lying.
But what about the others?

55:12.440 --> 55:13.880
Peter, the bodyguard.

55:15.880 --> 55:18.160
If it wasn't real,
then did he lie to me as well?

55:20.160 --> 55:22.000
Who is the woman with the kid?

55:23.360 --> 55:25.000
Was that Simon's daughter?

55:28.760 --> 55:31.760
I write a message to Amex.

55:31.840 --> 55:33.720
Can you give me some more information?

55:34.720 --> 55:39.200
They tell me to Google Shimon Hayut
and that I will find some answers.

55:43.040 --> 55:44.880
There's an article in Finnish.

55:47.960 --> 55:49.760
So I go into Google Translate.

55:54.480 --> 55:57.400
Israeli multi-millionaire
that cheated on women.

55:59.520 --> 56:00.680
What the fuck?

56:07.800 --> 56:11.360
Back in 2015, he had been defrauding
three Finnish women.

56:13.440 --> 56:15.480
They don't give names. They are protected.

56:18.760 --> 56:22.960
He was saying that he was in the weapons
industry to one of the women.

56:23.480 --> 56:26.080
To another woman,
he said he was a Mossad agent.

56:30.160 --> 56:33.560
That's insane. He goes to prison.
He becomes even worse.

56:34.400 --> 56:37.800
They let out a guy that has almost been,
like, cooking up a new plan.

56:40.560 --> 56:43.480
You knew he would
just continue, continue, continue.

56:45.480 --> 56:46.640
Who's gonna stop him?

56:50.360 --> 56:51.640
I had to stop him.

56:55.040 --> 56:59.240
I needed to go to the biggest newspaper
in Norway, VG.

57:01.160 --> 57:04.920
I was just praying, you know,
that they would take this on.

57:12.200 --> 57:15.840
This was really like
an unbelievable story.

57:18.760 --> 57:22.360
A guy who had pretended to be
a son of a diamond billionaire.

57:22.440 --> 57:27.800
Private jets, a luxury lifestyle. It, uh,
sounds almost like a fairy tale or movie.

57:29.800 --> 57:31.920
First thing you ask
as a journalist is

57:32.000 --> 57:34.720
what kind of documentation
can you share with us?

57:35.240 --> 57:37.120
You can't print it without documentation.

57:40.840 --> 57:42.520
Of course, I have WhatsApp.

57:46.280 --> 57:50.760
I then imagine strangers reading through
my inner thoughts, my fears,

57:50.840 --> 57:52.920
my love for this guy, you know?

57:53.000 --> 57:55.600
It's super private. It's selfies in bed.

57:57.600 --> 58:00.400
But the evidence came first,
and I just sent it over.

58:01.800 --> 58:05.640
It was almost 400 pages of text.

58:05.720 --> 58:06.720
There's video.

58:07.240 --> 58:08.560
Pictures.

58:09.080 --> 58:11.080
Okay, baby. I'm taking off now.

58:11.160 --> 58:12.760
Audio messages.

58:13.720 --> 58:14.760
It's astounding.

58:14.840 --> 58:18.040
It's like looking
into the anatomy of the relationship.

58:19.160 --> 58:22.640
We can follow how this developed
minute by minute.

58:26.640 --> 58:29.280
He's extremely professional
in what he does.

58:30.560 --> 58:32.800
The first date was a good way

58:32.880 --> 58:36.120
to lure her to believe
that he was really successful.

58:37.480 --> 58:39.880
This is an emotional con.

58:41.240 --> 58:43.440
He was promising so much…

58:43.520 --> 58:45.600
an apartment together,

58:45.680 --> 58:47.040
vacations,

58:48.120 --> 58:50.120
building a family together.

58:53.720 --> 58:55.320
I wanted to ask you a favor.

58:55.400 --> 58:57.360
The first request for money

58:57.440 --> 59:00.240
comes after
they've been dating for over a month.

59:00.320 --> 59:06.000
And he has been using that month
to make her fall in love with him,

59:06.080 --> 59:12.160
prove that he is really rich,
and make her afraid of his enemies.

59:12.800 --> 59:16.360
There's no reason to believe
that Simon is not able to pay her back,

59:16.440 --> 59:19.120
because she has seen how wealthy he is.

59:20.720 --> 59:23.320
Simon is surrounded
by a lot of people,

59:23.400 --> 59:26.400
especially his bodyguard
and his business partner.

59:26.480 --> 59:33.440
We don't know who is working with Simon
and how far this conspiracy actually goes.

59:36.520 --> 59:40.200
Cecilie was also sending us
this Finnish article.

59:43.800 --> 59:46.480
Is Shimon Hayut and Simon Leviev
the same guy?

59:48.960 --> 59:52.080
We all got in touch
with the authorities

59:52.160 --> 59:55.640
and found out the names
of the three Finnish women.

59:56.920 --> 1:00:02.000
I ask Cecilie, does she recognize
the victims' names?

1:00:09.160 --> 1:00:10.560
I Google these women.

1:00:17.280 --> 1:00:18.840
I don't recognize anyone.

1:00:27.560 --> 1:00:30.400
And then a face pops up
that is very familiar.

1:00:34.200 --> 1:00:37.280
It's the same woman
that was on the jet with me.

1:00:38.080 --> 1:00:41.200
The same woman
that has a child with Simon.

1:00:43.280 --> 1:00:46.240
How on the fucking Earth
were you a victim?

1:00:46.320 --> 1:00:50.280
You were standing at the trial
back in 2016.

1:00:51.440 --> 1:00:53.240
Putting him to jail,

1:00:54.400 --> 1:00:56.800
knowing that he had lied to you,

1:00:56.880 --> 1:01:02.480
and suddenly, three years later, you're
sitting on a private jet with Simon.

1:01:06.120 --> 1:01:07.920
The things that she told me in that car

1:01:08.000 --> 1:01:10.760
made me really believe
that he was a great guy.

1:01:13.480 --> 1:01:14.960
Why didn't she warn me?

1:01:24.960 --> 1:01:26.640
That was extraordinary,

1:01:28.240 --> 1:01:31.280
and it made it hard
because we didn't know who to trust.

1:01:35.680 --> 1:01:40.920
But we still had to prove to the police
that Shimon Yehuda Hayut and Simon Leviev

1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:42.280
was the same person.

1:01:46.240 --> 1:01:49.440
In the indictment,
we have his date of birth.

1:01:51.120 --> 1:01:54.080
So when we typed in
"Shimon Hayut" in Google,

1:01:55.000 --> 1:01:57.680
that didn't give us much,
basically nothing.

1:01:59.480 --> 1:02:03.480
But there's one thing that Simon Leviev
and Shimon Hayut has in common.

1:02:03.560 --> 1:02:04.960
They're both from Israel.

1:02:07.240 --> 1:02:11.200
We needed someone who knew Hebrew
and knew the country of Israel.

1:02:14.480 --> 1:02:17.480
So we contacted
this journalist called Uri.

1:02:19.840 --> 1:02:26.840
Uri finds out the last known address for
Shimon Hayut. We need to go to Israel.

1:02:39.480 --> 1:02:42.280
We're driving towards
the outskirts of the city,

1:02:42.360 --> 1:02:44.360
we see more narrow streets,

1:02:44.440 --> 1:02:48.360
smaller apartment buildings,
and a lot of ultra-Orthodox Jews.

1:02:49.960 --> 1:02:53.040
This was the total opposite

1:02:53.120 --> 1:02:56.760
of how he wanted to present his life
in social media.

1:02:59.080 --> 1:02:59.920
Is it here?

1:03:00.600 --> 1:03:01.920
So let's park, uh…

1:03:06.000 --> 1:03:08.360
-I asked him to stay very near.
-Okay.

1:03:09.040 --> 1:03:10.800
In case we need to escape.

1:03:11.600 --> 1:03:13.080
Uri, Natalie, and I go out.

1:03:14.160 --> 1:03:17.640
My job is to be the cameraman
that documents everything that happens.

1:03:17.720 --> 1:03:18.680
That's the name.

1:03:18.760 --> 1:03:20.960
That's the name. This one.

1:03:27.280 --> 1:03:28.160
Hmm.

1:03:38.760 --> 1:03:39.760
What's it says?

1:03:40.320 --> 1:03:41.640
It's a letter for him.

1:03:41.720 --> 1:03:43.320
-For Shimon?
-Shimon Hayut.

1:03:43.400 --> 1:03:44.680
Yeah, this one.

1:03:45.920 --> 1:03:48.120
So he might actually be staying here.

1:03:48.800 --> 1:03:51.720
So this is a letter from the authorities

1:03:51.800 --> 1:03:54.680
that ask money back from people
when you owe money.

1:03:54.760 --> 1:03:56.320
Oh, okay.

1:04:01.400 --> 1:04:02.280
Hello.

1:04:04.600 --> 1:04:06.160
Who are you?

1:04:06.240 --> 1:04:07.760
We're journalists.

1:04:08.800 --> 1:04:10.240
We're looking for Simon.

1:04:10.320 --> 1:04:11.480
Who is it?

1:04:11.560 --> 1:04:14.920
-You are not allowed to be here.
-But, Mom, come in.

1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:16.440
So, you're Simon's mother.

1:04:17.240 --> 1:04:19.080
-Where is he?
-Where is he?

1:04:19.160 --> 1:04:21.400
You're looking for him,
I'm looking for him.

1:04:21.480 --> 1:04:26.200
He's swindled a woman in Norway
for a quarter of a million dollars.

1:04:26.280 --> 1:04:29.680
I have absolutely no contact with him.
I have nothing to do with him.

1:04:29.760 --> 1:04:32.600
I've not had contact with him
since he was 18 years old.

1:04:32.680 --> 1:04:38.240
-But his registered address is here.
-He changed his name and address.

1:04:38.320 --> 1:04:40.160
He is not Hayut anymore.

1:04:40.240 --> 1:04:41.800
-So who is he?
-Leviev.

1:04:43.320 --> 1:04:44.240
Let's go.

1:04:48.480 --> 1:04:51.880
To confirm that Simon and Shimon
was the same person,

1:04:51.960 --> 1:04:54.040
we need to see the local police.

1:04:54.120 --> 1:04:56.480
Is this face familiar to you?

1:04:58.080 --> 1:04:58.920
Yes.

1:05:01.040 --> 1:05:07.920
In 2017, he changed his name
to Simon Leviev.

1:05:08.560 --> 1:05:11.480
Before that, he was known as Shimon Hayut.

1:05:12.760 --> 1:05:14.480
The police confirmed

1:05:14.560 --> 1:05:16.240
that Simon Leviev and Shimon Hayut

1:05:16.320 --> 1:05:18.280
is the same guy convicted in Finland.

1:05:20.320 --> 1:05:21.600
He uses many names.

1:05:25.160 --> 1:05:27.760
He has been a fraudster
since his late teens.

1:05:30.760 --> 1:05:34.120
You start to piece together
some more of the puzzle.

1:05:39.440 --> 1:05:45.000
Back in 2011, Simon was suspected
of stealing a check from his employer.

1:05:46.720 --> 1:05:51.160
He moves on to other stolen checks
and forged checks.

1:05:51.920 --> 1:05:55.480
Simon was supposed to meet in court,
but he fled the country.

1:05:56.960 --> 1:06:00.040
But then he left Israel.

1:06:00.120 --> 1:06:02.440
He forged a passport and left the country.

1:06:02.520 --> 1:06:05.040
So he's wanted by the police?

1:06:05.120 --> 1:06:05.960
Yes.

1:06:07.040 --> 1:06:10.360
The Israeli authorities
demand that he be found

1:06:10.440 --> 1:06:16.000
so the trial against him can continue.

1:06:16.080 --> 1:06:18.960
And we're doing what we can
to find him and bring him in.

1:06:21.360 --> 1:06:24.040
We got a lot of new
and really good information

1:06:24.120 --> 1:06:25.600
after the trip to Israel,

1:06:26.280 --> 1:06:29.680
but we don't know where he is right now.

1:06:35.960 --> 1:06:37.920
Well, I will keep you posted.

1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:40.240
Everybody else got their money,
so you should too.

1:06:40.320 --> 1:06:42.600
I will see what's going on.
I will call the bank.

1:06:42.680 --> 1:06:44.240
Love you. Miss you. Bye-bye.

1:06:44.320 --> 1:06:50.800
He really apologizes and says
that he needs to borrow a little bit more.

1:06:50.880 --> 1:06:54.640
I told him, "Simon, you were supposed
to transfer back this money you borrowed

1:06:54.720 --> 1:06:56.120
a week or two after."

1:06:56.200 --> 1:06:58.640
"Are you sure
everything is gonna be okay?"

1:06:58.720 --> 1:07:01.280
He's like,
"Yeah, everything is gonna be okay."

1:07:02.320 --> 1:07:06.560
So I transfer him another $10,000.

1:07:06.640 --> 1:07:09.680
I guarantee you
I will make payment next week.

1:07:14.600 --> 1:07:20.160
The next week,
he texts me a bank receipt for $100,000.

1:07:21.480 --> 1:07:25.440
Simon is being very generous.
He only owes me 40,000.

1:07:28.560 --> 1:07:31.160
Oh, seriously, Simon,
that is so nice of you.

1:07:31.240 --> 1:07:34.040
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you so, so much.

1:07:34.120 --> 1:07:35.400
Kisses.

1:07:35.480 --> 1:07:37.360
Through the most difficult moments,

1:07:37.440 --> 1:07:38.720
you have been there for me.

1:07:39.240 --> 1:07:42.480
So that's why I wanted to thank you
from the bottom of my heart.

1:07:43.320 --> 1:07:47.680
And then the money just don't arrive.

1:07:48.440 --> 1:07:52.120
Unfortunately,
the bank want me there physically

1:07:52.200 --> 1:07:55.280
with my lawyer
to sign some few other papers.

1:07:55.360 --> 1:08:00.920
I need to fly and I need to fix it up.
I want to ask you a favor.

1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:05.760
So I pay for these flights
on my American Express card.

1:08:05.840 --> 1:08:09.280
The money
has left our bank account

1:08:09.360 --> 1:08:12.280
so you have nothing to worry about.

1:08:12.360 --> 1:08:14.840
He asked me to help him
with another flight.

1:08:15.440 --> 1:08:18.680
And then another flight,
and then another flight.

1:08:19.760 --> 1:08:22.520
So with time just passing,
money doesn't come in.

1:08:23.520 --> 1:08:26.840
I was just at the bank
and they can't find any transfer.

1:08:26.920 --> 1:08:30.080
And that I need to pay my bills.
I'm really freaking out.

1:08:30.160 --> 1:08:34.440
I'm panicking. Like, I got myself
in so, so much trouble right now.

1:08:35.200 --> 1:08:37.640
They put a stop on my account.

1:08:37.720 --> 1:08:41.640
Of course I can give you
one of my watches.

1:08:41.720 --> 1:08:44.160
I have a watch worth over 100K.

1:08:45.600 --> 1:08:49.320
So he tells me
he will book me a flight to wherever he is

1:08:49.400 --> 1:08:51.680
within a couple of days
to collect the watch.

1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:02.680
We have a lot of new information,
but we still haven't found him.

1:09:02.760 --> 1:09:07.960
So what we have to do is go back into
the documentation we got from Cecilie.

1:09:17.040 --> 1:09:21.640
Cecilie gave us a lot of transactions
done with her Amex card.

1:09:23.760 --> 1:09:27.880
In these transactions,
we see flight tickets.

1:09:29.480 --> 1:09:30.960
There are also names.

1:09:34.880 --> 1:09:36.200
The business partner.

1:09:37.840 --> 1:09:38.920
The bodyguard.

1:09:40.640 --> 1:09:44.200
But we could also find names
of different women.

1:09:45.520 --> 1:09:48.080
So one of the names
is Pernilla Sjoholm.

1:09:55.080 --> 1:10:00.000
So I find Pernilla on Facebook
and write a message to her.

1:10:22.680 --> 1:10:25.160
I… panic.

1:10:25.240 --> 1:10:26.880
I thought I was gonna pass out.

1:10:28.200 --> 1:10:30.800
I forward the message
straight over to Simon.

1:10:37.360 --> 1:10:38.200
I would not…

1:10:38.280 --> 1:10:39.920
He says I shouldn't worry,

1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:42.840
that this is
his enemies trying to get information.

1:10:43.760 --> 1:10:47.440
He really tries to calm me down and even
just, like, after hanging up the phone,

1:10:47.520 --> 1:10:50.960
I'm starting to realize, like,
this can't be made up.

1:10:53.320 --> 1:10:55.880
My phone rings. It is Erlend.

1:10:57.560 --> 1:11:01.640
So I asked her, "Can I come to Stockholm
to meet you to talk through your story?"

1:11:02.160 --> 1:11:04.600
I get on a plane.
We were meeting up the next day.

1:11:07.840 --> 1:11:09.280
He tells me everything.

1:11:10.880 --> 1:11:14.000
I am furious.
Why would Simon do this to me?

1:11:14.080 --> 1:11:18.640
This was a friend
who I really cared about, who I loved.

1:11:21.280 --> 1:11:25.440
He really created this person
that I would like,

1:11:26.040 --> 1:11:29.120
someone who would be a really good friend.

1:11:31.120 --> 1:11:37.360
So, if it's not only through romantic
relationships that he's pursuing scams,

1:11:37.440 --> 1:11:39.040
what else could there be?

1:11:43.360 --> 1:11:46.760
I tell Erlend
about all the travels

1:11:46.840 --> 1:11:49.680
and the amount of money
he has been spending,

1:11:50.240 --> 1:11:52.880
and all the other people that I have met.

1:11:54.440 --> 1:11:57.800
When he tells me
about this Norwegian girl,

1:11:57.880 --> 1:12:01.600
I'm starting to realize
that the amount of money she has lost

1:12:01.680 --> 1:12:04.120
doesn't add up to the lifestyle
that he's been living,

1:12:04.200 --> 1:12:08.760
because there is an extreme amount
of money that has been spent.

1:12:10.680 --> 1:12:13.280
This must just be the tip of the iceberg.

1:12:15.120 --> 1:12:19.920
After looking at Pernilla's bank accounts,
I realize this may be a Ponzi scheme.

1:12:22.560 --> 1:12:26.600
He uses Cecilie's money on Pernilla,

1:12:26.680 --> 1:12:30.480
and he uses Pernilla's money
on somebody else.

1:12:34.480 --> 1:12:39.880
It's never his name on the credit card,
so he has plausible excuse.

1:12:39.960 --> 1:12:44.120
He can always say,
"I was just borrowing the money."

1:12:45.720 --> 1:12:49.320
It's almost like the perfect scam.

1:12:52.640 --> 1:12:54.720
Of course, by using
one woman's credit card

1:12:54.800 --> 1:12:59.080
to buy plane tickets to a second woman
and to buy a dinner to a third,

1:12:59.160 --> 1:13:03.080
he was able to travel a lot,
and he never stayed long in one place.

1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:09.960
That made it very hard for
local police authorities with low budgets

1:13:10.040 --> 1:13:14.080
to go after a man that,
in their world, was like a small scam.

1:13:14.160 --> 1:13:16.040
Hey, we order all the menu.

1:13:17.320 --> 1:13:20.240
I ask Pernilla,
"Can you tell me where he is?"

1:13:22.720 --> 1:13:25.400
I don't just only know
where he is.

1:13:25.480 --> 1:13:28.160
I am booked on a flight
to go and see him tomorrow.

1:13:28.240 --> 1:13:29.600
He's in Munich.

1:13:30.920 --> 1:13:33.040
In less than 10 hours,
we need to be in Munich.

1:13:46.360 --> 1:13:49.160
Our goal in Munich
was to film him

1:13:49.240 --> 1:13:52.840
to prove to the police
that he was possible to find.

1:13:54.560 --> 1:13:56.600
You're really focused.

1:13:56.680 --> 1:13:59.640
You know you have this one chance
to get what you want.

1:13:59.720 --> 1:14:04.760
Also you have responsibility for Pernilla.

1:14:05.880 --> 1:14:11.520
Simon can absolutely not find out that
they are there or that I have done this,

1:14:11.600 --> 1:14:13.960
because I don't know
if it's dangerous for me

1:14:14.040 --> 1:14:16.960
if he does find out
that I'm doing this behind his back.

1:14:17.040 --> 1:14:21.760
I'm going in there
trying to sabotage his fabulous life.

1:14:21.840 --> 1:14:23.720
The plan is to keep a safe distance,

1:14:23.800 --> 1:14:27.120
and to do that, Natalie is tracking
Pernilla's whereabouts on the iPhone.

1:14:27.720 --> 1:14:30.960
In case Simon should look
at Pernilla's phone,

1:14:31.040 --> 1:14:34.080
Pernilla saves my number
as a different name.

1:14:35.080 --> 1:14:39.120
That makes it possible for Pernilla
to have constant contact with me.

1:14:40.680 --> 1:14:43.720
She writes
that she's just landed.

1:14:44.920 --> 1:14:48.560
We have a photographer outside the airport
who may be able to get pictures.

1:14:48.640 --> 1:14:51.240
She writes, "My friend is picking me up."

1:14:52.200 --> 1:14:55.880
That must be Simon.

1:14:57.280 --> 1:15:00.640
I've now received a picture
from the photographer.

1:15:04.440 --> 1:15:08.360
Wow, he's in Munich.

1:15:08.440 --> 1:15:10.720
My heart is pounding.

1:15:11.400 --> 1:15:14.880
This is the first time
I meet his business partner, Avishay,

1:15:14.960 --> 1:15:17.000
that he had told me so much about.

1:15:18.440 --> 1:15:21.800
I'm starting to become very, very paranoid

1:15:21.880 --> 1:15:25.360
because who am I in the car with?
Who are they really?

1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:35.200
I'm looking at him, and I know the truth,
like everything that he has done.

1:15:37.640 --> 1:15:41.880
These former feelings that I had
that this was my friend just got erased.

1:15:42.640 --> 1:15:45.160
I don't think I ever hated a person
my entire life

1:15:45.240 --> 1:15:47.440
until that second
when I was sitting in that car

1:15:47.520 --> 1:15:48.840
and just looking at him.

1:15:51.880 --> 1:15:53.000
Pernilla texted me

1:15:53.080 --> 1:15:56.640
that they were going
to Mandarin Oriental Hotel.

1:15:56.720 --> 1:16:00.280
That's a fancy hotel
with a restaurant inside.

1:16:01.240 --> 1:16:02.080
Okay.

1:16:02.920 --> 1:16:05.080
The most important job I had in there

1:16:05.160 --> 1:16:08.600
was to text Kristoffer
and the still photographer

1:16:08.680 --> 1:16:11.440
whenever they were leaving the restaurant.

1:16:12.960 --> 1:16:15.440
Opposite,
there's a parking garage.

1:16:16.360 --> 1:16:18.600
Just behind gaps in the wall,

1:16:18.680 --> 1:16:21.960
we can place our lenses
to capture Simon as he walks out.

1:16:24.240 --> 1:16:28.200
Everyone knew about him.
"Welcome back, Mr. Leviev."

1:16:28.280 --> 1:16:30.320
And that gets me going.

1:16:30.400 --> 1:16:33.880
What have you been doing in Munich?
How many victims are here?

1:16:35.840 --> 1:16:39.200
He tells me he's sorry
about the situation with the money

1:16:39.280 --> 1:16:40.840
and he gives me the watch.

1:16:43.680 --> 1:16:45.760
He orders everything on the menu,

1:16:45.840 --> 1:16:49.480
and I feel so bad even sitting there
when we're having this dinner,

1:16:49.560 --> 1:16:52.040
'cause the only thing
that goes in my head is,

1:16:52.120 --> 1:16:53.640
"Who's paying for this dinner?"

1:16:55.360 --> 1:16:58.560
We're just waiting and waiting
for a text from Natalie.

1:17:22.000 --> 1:17:24.640
Simon looks in our direction, and we hide.

1:17:25.760 --> 1:17:29.800
Simon starts speaking in Hebrew
and getting very upset to Avishay.

1:17:29.880 --> 1:17:31.480
And I'm like, "What's going on?"

1:17:31.560 --> 1:17:34.240
And they were like,
"There's a camera guy over there."

1:17:35.480 --> 1:17:38.400
And he started screaming, like,
"Get into the car!"

1:17:44.880 --> 1:17:47.680
Driving around so fast through Munich.

1:17:52.360 --> 1:17:56.080
I don't know what they're saying. Do they
know that I have set them up to do this?

1:17:56.160 --> 1:17:57.720
What are they really gonna do with me?

1:18:01.160 --> 1:18:05.400
Just think, like, "Pernilla, you play
your biggest act you have ever done

1:18:05.480 --> 1:18:08.600
your entire life, because otherwise
you are never coming home."

1:18:11.120 --> 1:18:13.080
I'm trying to twist everything around.

1:18:14.080 --> 1:18:18.280
I'm screaming at him, like, "Is this your
enemies? Are they after me now, Simon?"

1:18:18.360 --> 1:18:22.240
He's trying to calm down the situation,
like, "No, it's me they're after."

1:18:23.480 --> 1:18:25.600
I'm telling him, "Just drop me off."

1:18:30.000 --> 1:18:33.160
I never opened a car door
as fast in my entire life.

1:18:39.160 --> 1:18:41.680
We were very concerned
about Pernilla.

1:18:41.760 --> 1:18:44.320
We realized we wouldn't be able
to confront him there.

1:18:47.080 --> 1:18:50.840
We need to go back to Oslo
and work out our next step.

1:18:56.760 --> 1:18:58.440
I take the watch
to a pawn shop,

1:18:58.520 --> 1:19:00.880
and they tell me it is fake.

1:19:01.480 --> 1:19:05.240
Of course it is,
because nothing about him is real.

1:19:06.320 --> 1:19:09.880
I really want to confront him
and at least tell me the truth.

1:19:10.400 --> 1:19:14.240
That's what you want from all people.
Just tell me the truth, how it is.

1:19:17.680 --> 1:19:19.600
Pernilla really wants
to talk to him,

1:19:19.680 --> 1:19:22.200
and we are filming that call.

1:19:22.280 --> 1:19:23.160
Hello.

1:19:23.880 --> 1:19:25.200
Hey, what's up? Good morning.

1:19:25.280 --> 1:19:26.120
Morning.

1:19:26.200 --> 1:19:27.320
Good afternoon. Sorry.

1:19:27.400 --> 1:19:29.200
It's okay. What are you doing?

1:19:30.040 --> 1:19:31.400
I'm all right, and you?

1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:32.920
Um…

1:19:34.040 --> 1:19:35.800
I'm not so good, Simon.

1:19:37.080 --> 1:19:37.920
What is it?

1:19:38.520 --> 1:19:40.200
Can you just tell me the truth?

1:19:41.200 --> 1:19:42.160
I told you the truth.

1:19:42.240 --> 1:19:44.280
No, you haven't told me the truth.

1:19:44.360 --> 1:19:47.200
Can you give me the entire truth?
At least I deserve that.

1:19:47.880 --> 1:19:50.760
I told you the entire truth,
I don't understand what is the--

1:19:50.840 --> 1:19:54.200
Simon. Simon, I lost everything I have.

1:19:54.280 --> 1:19:56.960
Can you please tell me the truth
for once. It's a little--

1:19:57.040 --> 1:20:02.400
Pernilla, you have no idea.
My enemies are trying to--

1:20:02.480 --> 1:20:07.480
Simon! Simon! Simon!
Simon, listen to me. I know.

1:20:08.400 --> 1:20:09.240
What do you know?

1:20:09.320 --> 1:20:10.160
I know about--

1:20:10.240 --> 1:20:11.880
Something that I don't know?

1:20:11.960 --> 1:20:13.000
What do you know?

1:20:13.080 --> 1:20:15.080
I know everything. Simon, I know--

1:20:15.160 --> 1:20:19.360
I know you're doing this fraud thing.
I know you've been in jail in Finland.

1:20:19.440 --> 1:20:20.280
I know you're--

1:20:20.360 --> 1:20:22.760
What the fuck is this bullshit?

1:20:22.840 --> 1:20:25.280
I know about the other people
that you have frauded.

1:20:25.360 --> 1:20:27.160
You double-cross me…

1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:29.520
I can tell you right now,

1:20:29.600 --> 1:20:31.920
you will pay for this
for the rest of your life.

1:20:32.000 --> 1:20:35.320
I am paying for the rest of my life.
You took everything I have.

1:20:35.400 --> 1:20:40.520
This is your mistake. If you want
to make some claims against me,

1:20:40.600 --> 1:20:43.360
give me the evidence you have against me.

1:20:43.440 --> 1:20:46.520
The Israeli police have confirmed you
with your picture.

1:20:47.040 --> 1:20:49.200
Nobody has confirmed anything.
That's not true.

1:20:49.280 --> 1:20:50.160
Yes.

1:20:50.240 --> 1:20:52.080
I had a flight to Amsterdam, right?

1:20:52.920 --> 1:20:53.760
Yeah.

1:20:53.840 --> 1:20:55.000
Yeah, who paid for that?

1:20:55.520 --> 1:20:56.360
I paid for it!

1:20:56.440 --> 1:20:57.320
No, you didn't.

1:20:57.400 --> 1:21:01.480
I have the transaction for the ticket,
and it's paid by another woman.

1:21:01.560 --> 1:21:03.960
Because of my enemies
I couldn't use my own…

1:21:04.040 --> 1:21:06.120
I have paid these people in cash.

1:21:06.200 --> 1:21:07.440
I did give them money.

1:21:07.520 --> 1:21:09.760
Simon, you can't keep doing this.

1:21:09.840 --> 1:21:11.880
Like, it's crazy.

1:21:13.240 --> 1:21:15.560
Honey, what have you done this all for?

1:21:15.640 --> 1:21:18.520
There will be a price,
and I promise it'll be bigger than money.

1:21:18.600 --> 1:21:20.200
What do you mean, the price?

1:21:20.720 --> 1:21:23.600
You double-cross me,
you're gonna pay for it.

1:21:27.080 --> 1:21:30.320
I really got scared,
because what have I done?

1:21:33.520 --> 1:21:37.280
The only thing that we can do is to make
the VG piece as big as possible

1:21:37.360 --> 1:21:38.800
to get his face out there,

1:21:38.880 --> 1:21:41.800
because if people would know who he is
and recognize his face,

1:21:41.880 --> 1:21:43.080
he can't do this anymore.

1:21:47.520 --> 1:21:50.680
Coming forward with a story like this
takes a lot of courage.

1:21:50.760 --> 1:21:55.320
I was feeling anxious, you know.
VG is the biggest newspaper in Norway.

1:21:55.400 --> 1:21:57.880
Like, my face would be on the front cover.

1:21:57.960 --> 1:22:00.280
There would be this big online special.

1:22:00.840 --> 1:22:04.080
I know that people were gonna judge me.
Am I ready?

1:22:06.200 --> 1:22:10.240
Your entire life
is never gonna be the same again.

1:22:18.080 --> 1:22:23.240
Everything just, like, went wildfire.
It felt like a nightmare.

1:22:26.320 --> 1:22:29.160
Social media is brutal, you know.
They'll eat you alive.

1:22:29.240 --> 1:22:33.160
People are saying what a gold digger
you are or, "She deserved this."

1:22:33.240 --> 1:22:36.520
A gold digger
would never give out a penny.

1:22:37.440 --> 1:22:41.440
I never understood this,
how you can blame a victim.

1:22:43.360 --> 1:22:46.280
All I did was just trying to help people.

1:22:47.400 --> 1:22:49.680
I didn't want anyone else to get hurt.

1:22:55.800 --> 1:22:57.560
But it was kind of nice
to just see

1:22:57.640 --> 1:23:01.200
and try to focus on the positive things
that people were writing.

1:23:08.200 --> 1:23:09.880
I could see the amount of shares.

1:23:10.480 --> 1:23:12.520
Comment after comment after comment.

1:23:12.600 --> 1:23:15.120
"Look at this story," you know.
"It's just insane."

1:23:17.880 --> 1:23:21.200
We were sitting there watching
the numbers go up and up.

1:23:22.520 --> 1:23:27.320
Everybody wanted to read
The Tinder Swindler. It was going viral.

1:23:28.840 --> 1:23:32.840
This is what I wanted.
His face is there. His name is there.

1:23:32.920 --> 1:23:36.800
No matter who he meets and he says,
"Hi. My name is Simon Leviev,"

1:23:36.880 --> 1:23:39.680
the moment they Google him now,
it will be there.

1:23:43.840 --> 1:23:47.640
I met Pernilla.
Immediately, we had a bond.

1:23:48.720 --> 1:23:53.160
This is the only person who really
understands what I am going through.

1:23:54.360 --> 1:23:56.480
We wanted
to keep the momentum up.

1:23:56.560 --> 1:23:58.240
We joined forces.

1:23:58.320 --> 1:24:01.440
Both of us had a goal
that this needed to come out

1:24:01.520 --> 1:24:05.360
in as many newspapers
in as many countries as possible.

1:24:05.440 --> 1:24:06.800
-Hello.
-Hi.

1:24:07.320 --> 1:24:09.720
First of all,
I wanted to apologize

1:24:09.800 --> 1:24:14.920
and let you know
that not all Israeli men are such crooks.

1:24:15.000 --> 1:24:20.520
Talk shows and news agencies in the US,
UK, Netherlands, Germany as well.

1:24:21.200 --> 1:24:24.880
We needed more exposure and more countries
to make their own investigations.

1:24:24.960 --> 1:24:28.160
Like, "What did he do in our country?
Do we have any victims here?"

1:24:30.000 --> 1:24:32.360
But another thing was
to actually get the police

1:24:32.440 --> 1:24:35.440
to feel the pressure from the media,
the pressure from the public,

1:24:35.520 --> 1:24:36.960
and do something about this.

1:24:40.600 --> 1:24:43.840
The response
was really overwhelming.

1:24:44.800 --> 1:24:48.400
We were contacted by victims
all over the world.

1:24:50.080 --> 1:24:54.480
I met him on Tinder in 2015.
We met up Copenhagen…

1:24:54.560 --> 1:24:57.560
We dated for around six months.
He met my family and friends.

1:24:57.640 --> 1:24:59.200
He stayed with us in New York.

1:24:59.280 --> 1:25:01.200
He said his name was Shimon Yehuda Hayut.

1:25:01.280 --> 1:25:04.600
-His name was Mordechay Tapiro.
-His name was Simon Leviev.

1:25:04.680 --> 1:25:08.440
My wife and I hired Simon
to babysit our five-year-old son.

1:25:08.520 --> 1:25:11.200
He was 20 years old at the time.

1:25:11.280 --> 1:25:14.440
We knew that his father was a rabbi
and he came from a very…

1:25:14.520 --> 1:25:16.600
He told me
he was heir to an Israeli airline.

1:25:16.680 --> 1:25:17.720
He employed me as his PA.

1:25:17.800 --> 1:25:20.120
He hired me
as his personal chauffeur.

1:25:20.200 --> 1:25:23.040
And he hired a lot of expensive cars.

1:25:23.120 --> 1:25:26.720
He never paid the bill. $300,000.

1:25:26.800 --> 1:25:30.720
He told me
that he was a Mossad agent

1:25:30.800 --> 1:25:33.560
working undercover as a pilot.

1:25:35.360 --> 1:25:38.440
He spent nearly $20,000.

1:25:38.520 --> 1:25:43.360
In just three days,
he spent $42,000 on our Amex card.

1:25:43.440 --> 1:25:45.720
Three of our checks
had been forged.

1:25:45.800 --> 1:25:48.080
Nearly $50,000 in total.

1:25:49.040 --> 1:25:51.760
I'm still not over it,
six years later.

1:25:51.840 --> 1:25:53.280
I'm scared of him.

1:25:58.200 --> 1:26:00.880
We got all this information,

1:26:01.600 --> 1:26:03.200
but nothing happened to him.

1:26:03.280 --> 1:26:06.320
He was still on the run,
he was still a free man,

1:26:06.400 --> 1:26:09.920
even though we knew
that he was reported to the police

1:26:10.000 --> 1:26:12.480
in at least seven different countries.

1:26:20.440 --> 1:26:23.000
I was at the airport in Prague.

1:26:23.080 --> 1:26:26.120
I had been visiting my boyfriend.

1:26:26.200 --> 1:26:29.320
While I was waiting for my plane to leave,

1:26:29.400 --> 1:26:35.760
I was scrolling through Instagram,
and I saw the picture of my boyfriend.

1:26:36.440 --> 1:26:37.800
I clicked on it.

1:26:39.480 --> 1:26:40.760
"The Tinder Swindler"?

1:26:42.120 --> 1:26:43.440
What the fuck is this?

1:26:46.040 --> 1:26:47.480
I was completely in shock.

1:26:48.320 --> 1:26:52.120
I sent the article to Simon,
and he started calling me.

1:26:53.160 --> 1:26:55.120
We were about to take off,

1:26:55.200 --> 1:26:59.600
so I downloaded the article
and put my phone on airplane mode.

1:27:02.720 --> 1:27:07.040
I saw that this girl Cecilie
met him on Tinder.

1:27:07.120 --> 1:27:09.280
I also met him on Tinder.

1:27:09.360 --> 1:27:14.640
He also took me to a five-star hotel
on the first date.

1:27:23.880 --> 1:27:26.640
I was already dating Simon for 14 months.

1:27:27.360 --> 1:27:30.480
So we were in a serious relationship.

1:27:31.560 --> 1:27:33.560
I loved him very much.

1:27:35.480 --> 1:27:39.520
He was very thoughtful.
He would remember every little thing.

1:27:41.920 --> 1:27:44.280
I shared my whole heart with him.

1:27:45.880 --> 1:27:51.400
We started talking about
settling down together, starting a family.

1:27:53.520 --> 1:27:56.800
I really felt
we were meant for each other.

1:28:04.600 --> 1:28:08.880
I was scrolling through the article.
I saw these videos coming up.

1:28:09.880 --> 1:28:13.120
Cecilie, my love, I love you.
I miss you. I can't wait to see you.

1:28:13.200 --> 1:28:15.320
He sent me the same video.

1:28:15.400 --> 1:28:16.680
Ayleen, darling,

1:28:18.040 --> 1:28:19.000
I miss you.

1:28:19.080 --> 1:28:19.920
Peter.

1:28:22.440 --> 1:28:25.960
I went through my WhatsApp history,
and I started to compare.

1:28:27.000 --> 1:28:31.680
He was sending exactly the same words
to her as he did to me.

1:28:32.360 --> 1:28:36.320
"Good morning, love. How are you?
I love you. I miss you."

1:28:36.400 --> 1:28:37.880
"I wanna have babies with you."

1:28:38.880 --> 1:28:42.760
He took Cecilie to Amsterdam, my hometown.

1:28:43.400 --> 1:28:47.360
Exactly the same period as we were dating,

1:28:47.440 --> 1:28:52.480
she was looking for houses
to start living with him in London.

1:28:53.720 --> 1:28:56.800
I was also looking for houses
in Amsterdam.

1:28:58.680 --> 1:29:02.520
The same day, he was flying to Oslo
for a business trip,

1:29:02.600 --> 1:29:05.040
he was just going out to see her.

1:29:06.120 --> 1:29:10.200
He texted me, "I'm tired as fuck."
Yeah, of course.

1:29:10.280 --> 1:29:13.360
He was with Cecilie all night.

1:29:15.440 --> 1:29:18.760
He told me that this business deal
in Munich went wrong.

1:29:20.320 --> 1:29:23.200
But he was meeting Pernilla.

1:29:26.160 --> 1:29:27.240
Peter is down!

1:29:29.080 --> 1:29:32.360
He sent exactly the same pictures to me,

1:29:33.520 --> 1:29:36.800
telling me that his enemies
had beaten Peter up.

1:29:37.840 --> 1:29:41.600
When I got those pictures,
I was terrified.

1:29:43.880 --> 1:29:47.520
It made me paranoid,
constantly looking over my shoulder.

1:29:48.640 --> 1:29:53.520
A few years ago, I was followed
by two guys and they beat me up.

1:29:54.520 --> 1:29:56.200
I told Simon about this.

1:29:56.720 --> 1:30:03.400
When Simon said I was being followed,
I was full of anxiety all the time.

1:30:05.760 --> 1:30:08.120
I'm reading that he is a fugitive.

1:30:10.840 --> 1:30:12.840
A convicted criminal.

1:30:14.400 --> 1:30:17.880
He swindled women for millions.

1:30:18.960 --> 1:30:24.680
My heart almost stopped beating,
because I also lent him money.

1:30:28.760 --> 1:30:30.560
It started off small.

1:30:32.840 --> 1:30:38.000
His enemies were tracking his phones,
so he asked me to get some SIM cards.

1:30:38.880 --> 1:30:41.040
So I was paying off those bills.

1:30:41.120 --> 1:30:43.840
But it became more and more and more.

1:30:45.160 --> 1:30:50.120
I gave him $140,000. So much money.

1:30:53.120 --> 1:30:58.200
Designer clothes, flight tickets
for other women. Fancy dinners.

1:30:59.320 --> 1:31:03.600
Now I see,
my money he spent on basically bullshit.

1:31:08.760 --> 1:31:10.360
I had so many emotions.

1:31:10.440 --> 1:31:12.520
The cheating part, the money part.

1:31:14.880 --> 1:31:18.200
On one small flight, I lost everything.

1:31:20.520 --> 1:31:22.560
I didn't want the plane to land,

1:31:22.640 --> 1:31:27.840
because I needed to face reality,
and that reality was terrifying.

1:31:32.040 --> 1:31:36.560
The moment I land in Amsterdam,
I knew he would call me.

1:31:36.640 --> 1:31:38.160
…an enjoyable flight.

1:31:38.240 --> 1:31:40.840
Thank you for flying with us,
and have a pleasant evening.

1:31:55.800 --> 1:31:58.240
I mean, I don't know
where this shit came from.

1:31:58.320 --> 1:32:00.840
He says the article was fake.

1:32:00.920 --> 1:32:05.080
Cecilie and Pernilla
would have been paid by his enemies

1:32:05.160 --> 1:32:07.240
to create this article.

1:32:08.680 --> 1:32:13.520
I knew I was defrauded.
I knew that he was fake.

1:32:13.600 --> 1:32:15.440
-I love you. I care about you--

1:32:21.680 --> 1:32:23.320
I talked to the police.

1:32:23.400 --> 1:32:26.240
They said they needed time
to build this case,

1:32:26.320 --> 1:32:28.760
but it was something I didn't have,

1:32:28.840 --> 1:32:32.080
because I knew that Simon was a fugitive.

1:32:32.160 --> 1:32:34.840
The moment he was able to get away,
he would.

1:32:37.440 --> 1:32:40.120
I didn't want him to get away with this.

1:32:43.480 --> 1:32:47.000
I wanted to talk to someone
who was in the article.

1:32:51.400 --> 1:32:53.600
I found Pernilla on Instagram.

1:32:55.320 --> 1:32:58.840
So I get a message
from this Dutch girl, Ayleen,

1:32:59.680 --> 1:33:02.280
saying that she's the girlfriend of Simon,

1:33:02.360 --> 1:33:04.240
and she has seen the story

1:33:04.320 --> 1:33:05.600
and says that it feels like

1:33:05.680 --> 1:33:08.200
she is in the middle
of a horror movie right now.

1:33:10.360 --> 1:33:11.200
Hi.

1:33:11.280 --> 1:33:13.960
Ayleen says she's going
to help us catch him,

1:33:14.480 --> 1:33:17.520
but there's something
she needs to do first.

1:33:20.360 --> 1:33:26.080
I needed to get my money back. But how?
I had to come up with a plan.

1:33:29.080 --> 1:33:33.920
Suddenly I realized
I was in a quite powerful position.

1:33:39.320 --> 1:33:42.800
He wasn't able
to get any women on Tinder anymore

1:33:42.880 --> 1:33:45.920
because his face was all over Google.

1:33:46.680 --> 1:33:48.240
So he was hiding in Prague

1:33:48.320 --> 1:33:51.880
and he had absolutely nowhere else to go
besides me.

1:33:53.640 --> 1:33:58.560
He always told me keep your friends close
and your enemies closer.

1:34:02.600 --> 1:34:05.400
To make him believe
I was still on his side,

1:34:05.480 --> 1:34:09.720
I told him I still love him,
that I believed everything he said.

1:34:11.200 --> 1:34:13.560
I even called these girls bitches.

1:34:15.160 --> 1:34:17.840
I'm texting Simon all the time,

1:34:17.920 --> 1:34:20.440
saying, "Good morning, love. How are you?"

1:34:20.520 --> 1:34:24.520
"Good night. Sleep well.
I love you. I miss you."

1:34:25.400 --> 1:34:28.560
And he keeps on telling me,
and, of course, it's Simon,

1:34:28.640 --> 1:34:32.560
that he needed money
to escape from his enemies.

1:34:32.640 --> 1:34:34.720
He needed fake passports.

1:34:36.520 --> 1:34:39.840
He wanted me to pawn my car.

1:34:40.800 --> 1:34:43.160
He wanted me to sell my house.

1:34:45.320 --> 1:34:50.680
That's when I got my idea. I was
going to swindle the Tinder Swindler.

1:34:52.960 --> 1:34:56.880
Simon only wears designer clothes.
He's covered in it.

1:34:56.960 --> 1:35:01.880
Versace, Gucci, Louis Vuitton,
Dolce & Gabbana.

1:35:03.480 --> 1:35:06.760
I work in the luxury fashion industry,

1:35:06.840 --> 1:35:10.840
so I know his wardrobe is worth a fortune.

1:35:12.880 --> 1:35:15.440
I said to him,
"Please, let me sell those clothes for you

1:35:15.520 --> 1:35:17.360
so we can generate some money."

1:35:19.120 --> 1:35:22.640
Simon has all of these clothes with him.

1:35:22.720 --> 1:35:24.240
I needed to go to Prague.

1:35:26.000 --> 1:35:29.960
Before I leave Amsterdam,
Simon had a credit card delivered to me.

1:35:30.760 --> 1:35:33.200
It says, "David Sharon."

1:35:34.160 --> 1:35:37.760
I take a picture
and send it to the police,

1:35:37.840 --> 1:35:42.160
telling them Simon is creating
a new identity.

1:35:51.920 --> 1:35:54.480
His address was in the middle of nowhere.

1:35:57.120 --> 1:36:00.400
As I'm getting closer,
my heart is pounding.

1:36:02.400 --> 1:36:06.720
I thought, "Oh, my God, how can I come up
with such a stupid plan?

1:36:06.800 --> 1:36:08.120
Because now I need to face him."

1:36:10.840 --> 1:36:14.880
He's not my boyfriend.
He's not the son of Lev Leviev.

1:36:14.960 --> 1:36:17.920
He's not working for LLD Diamonds.

1:36:18.000 --> 1:36:19.480
He is a fraud,

1:36:19.560 --> 1:36:23.360
and I have absolutely no idea
what he's capable of.

1:36:26.760 --> 1:36:29.280
He was already standing outside
waiting for me,

1:36:29.360 --> 1:36:32.520
and he hugged me
and he kissed me on the lips,

1:36:32.600 --> 1:36:35.840
and I felt disgusting.

1:36:35.920 --> 1:36:38.400
I was so angry and I wanted to scream,

1:36:38.480 --> 1:36:43.480
but the only thing I said was,
"I love you and I missed you."

1:36:47.800 --> 1:36:50.760
He made an appointment
in the center of Prague,

1:36:50.840 --> 1:36:53.080
and he wanted me to come along with him.

1:36:53.600 --> 1:36:58.160
We stopped outside this head office
of a plastic surgeon.

1:36:58.240 --> 1:37:01.360
I was like, "Oh, my God,
what are we going to do here?"

1:37:04.080 --> 1:37:09.720
He wanted to change his cheekbones,
his nose, his lips, maybe his chin,

1:37:10.480 --> 1:37:12.480
and the plastic surgeon says,

1:37:12.560 --> 1:37:15.440
"I'm sorry,
but I'm not going to do this surgery

1:37:15.520 --> 1:37:18.120
because only criminals want this."

1:37:18.720 --> 1:37:21.120
I almost spit out my water

1:37:21.200 --> 1:37:23.920
because I really wanted to say
to this surgeon,

1:37:24.520 --> 1:37:26.240
"But he is a criminal."

1:37:28.640 --> 1:37:34.720
As I'm watching this pathetic man crying
for not getting his plastic surgery,

1:37:34.800 --> 1:37:35.640
I thought,

1:37:36.760 --> 1:37:42.280
"If you weren't such… a piece of shit,
I would feel sorry for you."

1:37:45.240 --> 1:37:48.600
In the afternoon,
we played boyfriend and girlfriend,

1:37:48.680 --> 1:37:51.280
holding hands, having dinner together.

1:37:52.960 --> 1:37:58.000
But then I needed
to still sleep next to him.

1:38:02.120 --> 1:38:08.600
He didn't make any move, thank God,
but I was just in bed, frozen,

1:38:09.440 --> 1:38:12.200
looking at the ceiling all night.

1:38:18.040 --> 1:38:23.440
Morning finally comes,
I pack up three massive suitcases.

1:38:28.440 --> 1:38:30.960
Simon didn't even help me with it.

1:38:33.840 --> 1:38:38.160
Right before I was leaving,
he hands over this letter.

1:38:38.960 --> 1:38:44.600
He said, "Please read it in the plane."
I cannot get out of there fast enough.

1:38:52.200 --> 1:38:54.000
I remember that I had this letter.

1:38:54.800 --> 1:38:55.720
I have it here.

1:38:57.080 --> 1:39:02.040
"Dear Ayleen, well, as you know, this is
the most difficult time of my life,

1:39:02.120 --> 1:39:06.000
and I want to thank you
that you are standing by my side

1:39:06.080 --> 1:39:08.160
and that you don't give up on our love."

1:39:09.440 --> 1:39:14.360
"You are the woman of my dreams,
and I want to build a future together."

1:39:14.960 --> 1:39:17.720
"To marry you will be an honor for me."

1:39:18.240 --> 1:39:23.000
"And to make a family with kids together,
you are the woman I see it with."

1:39:24.280 --> 1:39:27.760
"You've got to help me
with everything you can."

1:39:27.840 --> 1:39:32.720
"It's for you, for your parents,
for our future. I'm worth it."

1:39:33.280 --> 1:39:36.200
"Now it's time
to do the impossible possible."

1:39:37.120 --> 1:39:40.200
"I'm blessed to have a woman like you
in my life

1:39:40.280 --> 1:39:43.240
to live in happy ever after."

1:39:43.320 --> 1:39:45.760
"I love you like I never loved before."

1:39:45.840 --> 1:39:47.040
"I trust you."

1:39:48.520 --> 1:39:49.480
"Don't give up."

1:39:50.880 --> 1:39:53.760
"Love you forever, yours, Simon."

1:39:55.360 --> 1:39:57.280
Just a piece of shit.

1:40:05.840 --> 1:40:08.040
I'm on Operation Sell, Sell, Sell.

1:40:18.760 --> 1:40:22.520
Simon is texting and calling me
all the time.

1:40:24.240 --> 1:40:27.480
"What have you sold?
Where's my money? You need to be quick."

1:40:29.080 --> 1:40:31.720
I keep on telling him
I haven't sold anything.

1:40:38.600 --> 1:40:44.040
I was selling, selling, selling. I was
never going to send him the money.

1:40:49.320 --> 1:40:55.280
I just got a notification that I got
an offer for one of Simon's items.

1:40:55.360 --> 1:40:56.920
Speaking of the Devil.

1:40:58.280 --> 1:41:00.840
So you're still
selling his things now?

1:41:00.920 --> 1:41:02.800
Yes, I'm still selling his things.

1:41:07.120 --> 1:41:11.240
Of course it wasn't in line
with everything that I gave him,

1:41:12.400 --> 1:41:14.920
but it felt like a little bit of payback.

1:41:23.280 --> 1:41:24.920
We need the money on Monday.

1:41:25.000 --> 1:41:27.760
Another day, another day.
Are you trying to buy time?

1:41:28.280 --> 1:41:32.440
You're dragging it over three fucking
weeks. It doesn't take three weeks.

1:41:34.720 --> 1:41:39.680
After a few weeks, he knows
that I was keeping the money for myself.

1:41:39.760 --> 1:41:42.440
That's when he turned around completely.

1:41:44.720 --> 1:41:48.040
You stop playing game
with me now! Stop!

1:41:49.040 --> 1:41:53.240
He bombs me with all these messages,
and they were so aggressive.

1:41:54.320 --> 1:41:57.680
If you're active, listen to me!
You're gonna give it today.

1:41:57.760 --> 1:41:59.760
You don't know
where the fuck you're going.

1:41:59.840 --> 1:42:02.400
Voice memos of, like, 20 minutes.

1:42:02.480 --> 1:42:04.480
I'm sorry about what I said,
but that's it.

1:42:04.560 --> 1:42:06.440
But you're taking the piss out of me.

1:42:06.960 --> 1:42:10.320
This is where I saw
his several personalities.

1:42:10.400 --> 1:42:12.240
I love you
and I care about you.

1:42:12.320 --> 1:42:13.760
I ask a thousand fucking times.

1:42:13.840 --> 1:42:16.040
I ask nicely. I'm speaking to you nicely.

1:42:16.120 --> 1:42:18.760
I try to respect you,
but it's like you're fucking with me.

1:42:19.840 --> 1:42:21.840
You have no idea
how much I love you.

1:42:21.920 --> 1:42:24.760
You just need to trust me one last time.

1:42:25.360 --> 1:42:30.760
I need an answer tomorrow. Believe in me.
Have a leap of faith for one time. Do it.

1:42:30.840 --> 1:42:33.160
Don't send me lies.
I know how to lie.

1:42:33.240 --> 1:42:34.640
I can teach you how to lie.

1:42:34.720 --> 1:42:36.960
I need this money to succeed.

1:42:41.520 --> 1:42:44.880
Help me out here.
I don't have nobody else. I have only you.

1:42:45.920 --> 1:42:47.360
I'm begging from you, please.

1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:52.240
I give you advice. Choose it!

1:42:52.320 --> 1:42:54.320
You disappear.
Nobody can see your messages.

1:42:54.400 --> 1:42:56.440
I'm not your enemy. I'm not fighting you.

1:42:56.520 --> 1:43:01.480
And you will get the worst fucking enemy
you have ever seen in your life

1:43:01.560 --> 1:43:05.480
for you and for your fucking family
if you will ever play with me!

1:43:05.560 --> 1:43:07.040
Give it today.

1:43:12.280 --> 1:43:14.400
Look, Ayleen,
I'm sorry about everything.

1:43:14.480 --> 1:43:17.400
I give you the last fucking
warning! Today. You want war?

1:43:17.480 --> 1:43:20.760
You will get fucking war!
You will get fucking war!

1:43:27.080 --> 1:43:29.080
It was a horrible experience.

1:43:31.120 --> 1:43:36.520
But part of me was actually enjoying
seeing him "swerm."

1:43:37.560 --> 1:43:39.280
Squirm. No.

1:43:43.040 --> 1:43:45.600
Ayleen, can I ask you a favor?

1:43:45.680 --> 1:43:49.480
Can you put me one lottery ticket
with numbers that I can choose?

1:43:50.160 --> 1:43:54.000
How pathetic can you be?
I thought you were a billionaire.

1:44:01.080 --> 1:44:05.080
He has no money coming in.
He had no one to go to.

1:44:09.960 --> 1:44:12.920
He even sent me pictures and texts

1:44:13.000 --> 1:44:16.600
that he was eating leftovers
in a shopping mall.

1:44:18.400 --> 1:44:21.080
He grew himself, like, this big beard.

1:44:21.160 --> 1:44:26.160
He was sleeping in hostels of $12 a night.

1:44:35.160 --> 1:44:37.760
At this moment, I see the real Simon,

1:44:37.840 --> 1:44:43.920
because without other people's money,
he was nobody, and he's nothing.

1:44:53.440 --> 1:44:56.320
He even called himself
"the homeless king."

1:44:57.480 --> 1:45:00.960
The prince of diamonds
to this homeless king.

1:45:02.280 --> 1:45:04.120
Cry me a river.

1:45:11.480 --> 1:45:13.880
One morning, I get a text from him.

1:45:26.960 --> 1:45:32.760
A few weeks before, he was just mentioning
he wanted to go to Greece.

1:45:34.600 --> 1:45:38.720
When I text him back,
my message wasn't receiving.

1:45:39.920 --> 1:45:42.160
I just saw one tick.

1:45:43.280 --> 1:45:45.720
That's when I realized
that he was on a flight,

1:45:45.800 --> 1:45:48.240
because Simon is always on his phone.

1:45:52.840 --> 1:45:56.920
I'm searching for flights
from Prague to Athens.

1:46:00.240 --> 1:46:05.480
I found a flight exactly the same time
as he went offline.

1:46:08.640 --> 1:46:13.680
I took a screenshot of the details,
and I sent it directly to the police.

1:46:15.800 --> 1:46:20.840
He wouldn't travel under Simon Leviev
because he was wanted for fraud.

1:46:22.880 --> 1:46:28.360
I also make sure they had the name that
I saw on the credit card, David Sharon.

1:46:33.240 --> 1:46:35.680
Now, it was in the hands of the police.

1:46:58.400 --> 1:47:01.240
It was one of the best moments of my life.

1:47:02.440 --> 1:47:04.240
He even says…

1:47:09.480 --> 1:47:13.800
He got arrested by Interpol
on a fake passport,

1:47:13.880 --> 1:47:15.600
under the name David Sharon.

1:47:16.800 --> 1:47:17.760
Yeah.

1:47:21.760 --> 1:47:24.200
Ayleen tells me, "We got him!"

1:47:25.160 --> 1:47:27.360
I just wanted to call Cecilie.

1:47:28.320 --> 1:47:32.960
I was like, "Are you fucking kidding me?
He's really caught? Now? Today?"

1:47:37.760 --> 1:47:40.960
I can't even describe the joy it is.

1:47:41.040 --> 1:47:43.920
This is what I wanted.
I wanted to see him in handcuffs.

1:47:44.440 --> 1:47:46.720
I needed justice for myself.

1:47:47.720 --> 1:47:50.320
Does he know
you gave that information to the police?

1:47:50.400 --> 1:47:54.120
No. He never believed
that I was capable of doing this.

1:47:55.360 --> 1:47:57.200
He knows now.

1:47:59.320 --> 1:48:00.520
Hi, Simon.

1:48:01.600 --> 1:48:04.360
Everything that we did
did have an effect.

1:48:04.440 --> 1:48:06.640
We helped at least one person,

1:48:06.720 --> 1:48:08.720
and we did get him arrested.

1:48:08.800 --> 1:48:12.920
Maybe not for everything that we wanted,
but he did get arrested.

1:48:13.000 --> 1:48:15.720
So our action had a reaction.

1:49:28.080 --> 1:49:34.120
Just got my new iPhone 12 Pro.
Just received the new shoes. Perfect.

1:49:43.000 --> 1:49:46.480
This is the real deal.
The Bentley or the Ferrari.

1:50:17.240 --> 1:50:20.360
I wish you
a great and magnificent evening.

1:50:39.880 --> 1:50:42.400
I will proceed
with the lawsuit against you

1:50:42.480 --> 1:50:44.240
for defam-in-ation and lies

1:50:44.320 --> 1:50:47.560
and, you know, that everything is based,
basically, on a lie.

1:50:47.640 --> 1:50:50.080
And that's it, this is how it's gonna be.

1:50:55.360 --> 1:50:57.120
Have you been
on Tinder since?

1:50:57.200 --> 1:51:00.000
Yes. Oh, tons. Yeah, I know.

1:51:00.080 --> 1:51:02.680
Everyone is asking me.
Tinder has nothing to do with this.

1:51:02.760 --> 1:51:04.400
I was on Tinder immediately.

1:51:04.480 --> 1:51:07.800
-You're still looking for love?
-I'm still looking for love. So…

1:51:08.320 --> 1:51:10.040
Always.
