<i>"Last Man Standing"</i>
<i>is recorded</i>

00:04.605 --> 00:06.005
<i>In front of a live</i>
<i>studio audience.</i>

00:06.007 --> 00:07.006
Hey.
Oh, hey, kids.

00:07.008 --> 00:08.307
Hi, mama.
Is Boyd ready?

00:08.309 --> 00:09.341
Uh, no, no, no.

00:09.343 --> 00:11.143
They're not back yet
from the ice show.

00:11.145 --> 00:13.045
So, big, bad Mike Baxter

00:13.047 --> 00:15.347
Likes to watch himself
some ice dancing.

00:15.349 --> 00:16.815
Not exactly.

00:16.817 --> 00:18.650
See, aladdin lost a thumb
one year,

00:18.652 --> 00:20.452
So Mike keeps hoping
for a repeat.

00:21.654 --> 00:24.023
I just hope Boyd's able
to sit still for him.

00:24.025 --> 00:26.225
He keeps getting into trouble
at school.

00:26.227 --> 00:29.194
Last Friday, miss snyder sent
him to the school counselor.

00:29.196 --> 00:30.662
Oh, honey,
I wouldn't worry.

00:30.664 --> 00:32.364
Boyd's a pretty
high-spirited kid.

00:32.366 --> 00:33.632
The counselor wants us

00:33.634 --> 00:35.701
To take him
to a child psychiatrist.

00:35.703 --> 00:37.136
Well, see that?

00:37.138 --> 00:39.805
If they were really worried,
they'd want him to see an adult.

00:39.807 --> 00:42.174
Mom, this is no joke,
okay?

00:42.176 --> 00:45.010
The other day,
Boyd threw a stick.

00:45.012 --> 00:46.478
Of dynamite?

00:47.480 --> 00:48.747
It might as well
have been,

00:48.749 --> 00:50.215
The way
his teacher overreacted.

00:50.217 --> 00:52.384
Yeah. Miss snyder is sending us
e-mails every day.

00:52.386 --> 00:54.920
All caps, bold,
exclamation points.
Oh.

00:54.922 --> 00:57.990
I swear, if she had this much
passion in the classroom,

00:57.992 --> 00:59.925
She could
hold Boyd's attention.

00:59.927 --> 01:03.162
The hockey game
was awesome!

01:03.164 --> 01:05.030
Wh-- hockey?
What? Daddy, I th--

01:05.032 --> 01:06.932
Honey, I thought you were
taking him to the ice show.

01:06.934 --> 01:09.735
Nhl --
greatest show on ice.

01:09.737 --> 01:12.337
It had a little bit
of everything, too --

01:12.339 --> 01:13.705
A fight in the first period,

01:13.707 --> 01:15.574
A goalie fight
in the second period,

01:15.576 --> 01:18.110
And an all-out brawl
in the row ahead of us.

01:18.112 --> 01:19.912
I picked up a tooth.

01:19.914 --> 01:21.180
You what?

01:21.182 --> 01:23.449
I made him
give it back to the lady.

01:24.751 --> 01:27.252
Mike, we have talked about this
so many times.

01:27.254 --> 01:29.455
We don't like exposing Boyd
to that much violence.

01:29.457 --> 01:30.923
It was a sporting event.

01:30.925 --> 01:34.259
I didn't expect a bloodbath.
That was just like a bonus.

01:34.261 --> 01:35.694
Checked you!
Ohh! Ow!

01:35.696 --> 01:37.429
Boyd, cut it out.

01:37.431 --> 01:39.031
Make me.
You want to go?

01:39.033 --> 01:40.199
Oh, I'll go.

01:40.201 --> 01:42.334
Go, go, go!
Get him! Get him!

01:43.436 --> 01:45.771
All right, all right, all right,
that's it -- five for fighting.

01:45.773 --> 01:47.272
Hey, hey,
where are you in there?

01:47.274 --> 01:49.108
You know what the penalty is
at grandma's house?

01:49.110 --> 01:50.943
A cookie!

01:50.945 --> 01:52.945
Yay!

01:52.947 --> 01:55.114
Uh, I was fighting, too.
Where's my cookie?

01:55.116 --> 01:57.216
Where's your grandma?

01:57.218 --> 01:58.784
Thanks
for your help, dad.

01:58.786 --> 01:59.918
We are actually trying

01:59.920 --> 02:01.820
To tamp down
Boyd's aggressiveness.

02:01.822 --> 02:04.389
Yeah, the counselor at school
wants him to see a psychiatrist.

02:04.391 --> 02:05.390
Really?

02:05.392 --> 02:06.825
Well, we don't think
it hurts for him

02:06.827 --> 02:08.327
To talk his feelings out
with somebody.

02:08.329 --> 02:09.595
He's 6.

02:09.597 --> 02:13.098
After he explains
why he doesn't like lima beans,

02:13.100 --> 02:15.434
What are they gonna fill up
the rest of the hour with?

02:15.436 --> 02:18.937
His bad first marriage?

02:18.939 --> 02:22.007
-- Captions by vitac --

02:25.778 --> 02:28.947
Okay. Describe
the internecine social forces

02:28.949 --> 02:31.083
Which led to the rise
of the nazi party.

02:31.085 --> 02:32.117
Ooh.
The party -- right.

02:32.119 --> 02:33.652
I have to text rachel back
and tell her

02:33.654 --> 02:34.887
I can't make it
to her party.

02:35.922 --> 02:39.191
She's gonna be,
like, nazi mad.

02:39.193 --> 02:40.359
Mandy.
Yeah?

02:40.361 --> 02:41.493
Put your phone down.

02:41.495 --> 02:42.928
We've been studying
for more than an hour,

02:42.930 --> 02:44.796
And you haven't answered
one of these questions.

02:44.798 --> 02:45.931
That's not true.

02:45.933 --> 02:48.167
I answered julie's
very challenging question

02:48.169 --> 02:49.701
About what shoes to wear.

02:52.472 --> 02:54.640
You're texting right now,
aren't you?

02:54.642 --> 02:56.208
What?

02:56.210 --> 02:58.844
I can see you spelling things
out with your lips.

02:58.846 --> 03:00.846
All right.

03:00.848 --> 03:02.281
You're right.

03:02.283 --> 03:04.283
If I want to make it
into the fashion program,

03:04.285 --> 03:06.051
I got to do really well
on my finals,

03:06.053 --> 03:07.986
So...Take my phone.

03:07.988 --> 03:09.021
Your phone?
Yep.

03:09.023 --> 03:10.556
Seriously?
Mm-hmm.

03:10.558 --> 03:13.258
Wow! It's like
you're giving me your baby.

03:14.727 --> 03:17.863
A baby you've dropped
on the ground a lot.

03:17.865 --> 03:19.164
And no matter what I say,

03:19.166 --> 03:21.033
Don't give it back to me
until after my finals are done.

03:21.035 --> 03:23.368
[ cellphone chimes ]
give it back to me.

03:23.370 --> 03:25.003
Whatever it is,
I'll take care of it for you.

03:25.005 --> 03:26.905
But what if
it's important?
[ chuckles ]

03:26.907 --> 03:28.373
It's just a picture
of a kitty in a basket.

03:28.375 --> 03:30.676
Wait, no.
Whose kitty? Which basket?!

03:30.678 --> 03:31.710
I need to know!

03:31.712 --> 03:33.078
And powered down.
No.

03:33.080 --> 03:37.049
[ whimpers ] ooh.

03:38.384 --> 03:40.652
[ laughing ]

03:41.721 --> 03:43.055
This is okay. This is great.

03:43.057 --> 03:45.023
This is good.
It's really, really good.

03:45.025 --> 03:47.392
Because, like,
now I can just...

03:47.394 --> 03:48.727
[ breathes deeply ]

03:48.729 --> 03:50.729
I can pay attention,
you know?

03:50.731 --> 03:52.998
[ breathes deeply ]

03:56.336 --> 03:58.070
When did you grow
that beard?

03:59.772 --> 04:02.441
All right, good. Mike's home.
At least he'll agree with me.

04:02.443 --> 04:04.076
I disagree.

04:04.078 --> 04:06.745
Kristin wants her grandson
to be on drugs.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.547
What?
Whoa.
Not drugs, okay?

04:08.549 --> 04:10.549
Medicine,
prescribed by a doctor.

04:10.551 --> 04:12.751
They took Boyd
to see that psychiatrist,

04:12.753 --> 04:14.553
And he diagnosed him
with adhd.

04:14.555 --> 04:15.754
Of course he did.

04:15.756 --> 04:17.756
They don't get rich by going,
"your kid's fine.

04:17.758 --> 04:19.124
Take him home."

04:19.126 --> 04:21.693
Listen, Boyd's been getting
harder and harder to deal with,

04:21.695 --> 04:23.695
And the doctor thinks
that these could help.

04:23.697 --> 04:25.864
But, Kris, this is
a serious narcotic, okay?

04:25.866 --> 04:26.865
I-it's speed!

04:26.867 --> 04:28.400
I know truck drivers
who use this

04:28.402 --> 04:29.735
So they can drive
across the country

04:29.737 --> 04:31.236
Without ever having
to blink.

04:31.238 --> 04:32.604
Yeah, but for adhd kids,

04:32.606 --> 04:35.274
This medicine actually
calms them down, okay?

04:35.276 --> 04:37.576
Dr. Frye just wants
Boyd to try it for a few days

04:37.578 --> 04:39.311
And see if there's
any improvement.

04:39.313 --> 04:41.980
Well, what exactly needs
to be improved about Boyd?

04:41.982 --> 04:45.150
He doesn't listen, he talks
out of turn, he's rebellious,

04:45.152 --> 04:47.586
He runs around like crazy
at recess.
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

04:47.588 --> 04:49.154
She's right.
I've heard about this.

04:49.156 --> 04:50.656
What is it?
What's it called?

04:50.658 --> 04:52.991
Oh. Oh, yeah.
Being a boy.

04:54.394 --> 04:57.229
It affects
almost half the population,

04:57.231 --> 04:59.464
And if -- if --
if you leave it untreated,

04:59.466 --> 05:01.133
They grow into,
what -- men?

05:01.135 --> 05:03.402
And they create civilizations!
I've heard of this!

05:03.404 --> 05:05.137
And blow them up.

05:05.139 --> 05:07.139
And then rebuild them.

05:07.141 --> 05:09.441
We need projects.

05:09.443 --> 05:11.143
This is just lazy teachers

05:11.145 --> 05:14.780
Just trying to drug the boy
out of our boy.
Exactly.

05:14.782 --> 05:16.114
And, then, meanwhile,

05:16.116 --> 05:18.116
Qualities that are
more inherently female

05:18.118 --> 05:20.152
Get rewarded and praised
in the classroom.

05:20.154 --> 05:22.454
You mean like listening
and cooperating?

05:22.456 --> 05:24.323
Yeah, crap like that.

05:25.491 --> 05:27.626
Okay, I, for one,
wouldn't mind a world

05:27.628 --> 05:29.494
Where female qualities
prevailed.

05:29.496 --> 05:31.263
Oh, here we go.
Yeah, no, hear, hear!

05:31.265 --> 05:33.131
Here we go. Here --
for one thing,
there would be no war.

05:33.133 --> 05:36.268
T-there'd be nothing
worth fighting over!
Oh, stop it.

05:36.270 --> 05:38.837
You guys would've
never invented anything

05:38.839 --> 05:40.605
Except spanx and a telephone.

05:40.607 --> 05:44.943
What?
And sit around, "hey, you should
see my ass in these. Uh-huh."

05:44.945 --> 05:47.279
I just think
there have to be alternatives

05:47.281 --> 05:49.848
To pumping Boyd's young brain
full of chemicals.

05:49.850 --> 05:52.117
I -- I mean, honestly, I'd be
glad to do some research.

05:52.119 --> 05:54.953
Or we could just do what the
doctor recommended that we do.

05:54.955 --> 05:57.322
Honey, now, technically,
I'm a doctor, too.

05:57.324 --> 05:58.990
You have a phd in geology,
mom, okay?
Yeah.

05:58.992 --> 06:01.526
I'll call you
when my rock gets the flu.
Oh, come on.

06:01.528 --> 06:02.627
Ladies, ladies, ladies.

06:02.629 --> 06:04.730
What happened to listening
and cooperation?

06:06.366 --> 06:08.533
Honey, what your mom is saying
isn't unreasonable.

06:08.535 --> 06:09.668
Let's just put these aside

06:09.670 --> 06:11.336
And explore
some other alternatives.

06:11.338 --> 06:12.537
All right, fine. All right.

06:12.539 --> 06:14.706
But I'm giving miss snyder
your e-mail address.

06:14.708 --> 06:17.342
Maybe your mom can find
something to calm down
Boyd a little bit.

06:17.344 --> 06:19.811
I want to try.
Or do what my grandma
used to do to calm us down.

06:19.813 --> 06:22.214
"just give the boy
some rye toast

06:22.216 --> 06:25.450
And just pray
for a good b.M."

06:31.157 --> 06:33.024
Morning.
Morning, honey.

06:33.026 --> 06:35.560
Grandma's letting me
have coffee.

06:35.562 --> 06:38.497
Does that mean
I get a beer?

06:38.499 --> 06:40.699
Okay, grandpa.
No, no, no.
Come here, honey.

06:40.701 --> 06:43.068
No, no, no. No. No, Boyd,
grandpa's not having beer.

06:43.070 --> 06:47.439
No. You be a good boy --
finish your coffee.

06:47.441 --> 06:50.442
Otherwise you won't
get your cigarette.

06:50.444 --> 06:52.244
Listen,
I did some research,

06:52.246 --> 06:55.580
And caffeine has been proven
to calm down hyperactive kids.

06:55.582 --> 06:57.749
Where'd you read that?
On a starbucks cup?

06:57.751 --> 07:01.253
I'm also getting rid of all this
junk food we buy for Boyd --

07:01.255 --> 07:04.456
Anything with sugar, artificial
color, preservatives...

07:04.458 --> 07:05.957
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

07:05.959 --> 07:08.427
Those are my pop tarts.
Why am I being punished?

07:08.429 --> 07:10.662
I'm not the spaz.

07:11.798 --> 07:13.632
Grandpa,
can you top me off?

07:13.634 --> 07:14.966
No, no, no.
That's enough.

07:14.968 --> 07:17.803
What, no free refills?
What's this, europe?

07:17.805 --> 07:20.806
Come on,
let's go do yoga! Yay!

07:20.808 --> 07:22.107
No more coffee?

07:22.109 --> 07:23.909
Well, anyway,
I don't even need it.

07:23.911 --> 07:25.710
Ever since
Kyle took my phone away,

07:25.712 --> 07:27.312
I have,
like, this laser focus.

07:27.314 --> 07:29.714
They say that people only use
a fifth of their brains,

07:29.716 --> 07:32.083
But suddenly, I feel like
I'm using a lot more than that,

07:32.085 --> 07:33.752
Like -- like a sixth,
like a seventh,

07:33.754 --> 07:37.756
Like -- like,
an entire eighth.

07:37.758 --> 07:39.458
Honey,
when you get to the part

07:39.460 --> 07:41.493
That understands math,
you let me know.

07:41.495 --> 07:42.961
[ laughs ] hey!

07:42.963 --> 07:44.963
I got that.

07:46.766 --> 07:49.668
So, this is warrior 1.

07:49.670 --> 07:51.303
Where's warrior 2?
I'm ready to fight him!

07:51.305 --> 07:53.972
Hyah!
No. Okay, no, no.
Oh, no. No, no, no.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.740
No fighting,
no fighting, honey.

07:55.742 --> 07:58.410
This is fun. Then you take
some deep breaths, okay?

07:58.412 --> 08:00.312
And stand perfectly still.

08:00.314 --> 08:02.914
Just...
[ breathes deeply ]

08:07.820 --> 08:10.856
And get your butt kicked
by warrior 2.

08:10.858 --> 08:12.757
No. Come on.

08:16.162 --> 08:18.363
Oh, hey,
hang on, megan.

08:18.365 --> 08:20.165
Mr. B., I'm in a bind.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.033
Mandy's so busy studying
right now

08:22.035 --> 08:24.002
That I'm handling
all of her calls,

08:24.004 --> 08:26.004
But I think that this one
might be important.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.172
It's not.

08:27.174 --> 08:30.141
But you haven't even
heard it yet.
It's not.

08:30.143 --> 08:32.043
Yeah, but megan says
that zach and brittany

08:32.045 --> 08:33.945
Weren't supposed to hook up
at the party,

08:33.947 --> 08:37.849
But after one drink, it was all,
"brown chicken, brown cow!"

08:37.851 --> 08:40.519
You take that
to my daughter

08:40.521 --> 08:43.522
And you are so fired...
♪ right now

08:43.524 --> 08:45.557
Got it.

08:45.559 --> 08:47.392
Hey.
Good morning.

08:47.394 --> 08:49.694
Morning.
When you were a kid,
did you ever drink coffee?

08:49.696 --> 08:52.464
We were too poor.
Couldn't afford a coffee maker.

08:52.466 --> 08:53.632
We just chewed the beans

08:53.634 --> 08:55.600
And poured the hot water
in our mouths.

08:57.203 --> 09:00.372
Same way we made pasta.

09:00.374 --> 09:03.308
Vanessa's giving my grandson
a little bit of coffee.

09:03.310 --> 09:05.677
She thinks it's gonna help
with that adhd.

09:05.679 --> 09:07.579
See, when I was a kid,
we didn't have

09:07.581 --> 09:09.681
These -- these
fancy new designer diseases.

09:09.683 --> 09:13.318
We stuck to the classics --
chicken pox, mumps, measles.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.754
Anything else, we didn't want
to hear about it.

09:15.756 --> 09:20.559
I may have had dengue fever
the whole sixth grade.

09:20.561 --> 09:22.961
I still ran track.

09:25.431 --> 09:29.234
When did peanuts, mold,
and gluten become so dangerous?

09:29.236 --> 09:31.369
I don't know.
I mean, iran doesn't need
a nuclear weapon.

09:31.371 --> 09:33.772
They could take out
half the United States
with a jar of skippy.

09:35.908 --> 09:39.911
All Boyd needs is to --
to get outside more

09:39.913 --> 09:42.280
And -- and play like --
like we used to.

09:42.282 --> 09:44.883
We didn't have
a ride to school.

09:44.885 --> 09:47.218
We walked the 5 miles,
no matter what the weather.

09:47.220 --> 09:50.722
And if there was a tornado,
we just got there faster.

09:50.724 --> 09:52.924
By the time we arrived,

09:52.926 --> 09:55.360
We were too exhausted
to torture the teacher.

09:55.362 --> 09:58.430
Uh-huh.
All Boyd needs is to work off
that extra energy.

09:58.432 --> 10:01.099
He should be run
like a sled dog.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.768
In the winter,
for exercise,

10:03.770 --> 10:06.972
My mother would tape us
into a cardboard box, right?

10:06.974 --> 10:08.306
Ring the dinner bell

10:08.308 --> 10:10.609
And we'd have to punch
our way out

10:10.611 --> 10:11.910
If we wanted to eat.

10:11.912 --> 10:13.912
He's penned up.
That's it.
Mm-hmm.

10:13.914 --> 10:15.647
He's trapped.
He's penned up at the apartment.

10:15.649 --> 10:17.048
He's penned up
all day at school.

10:17.050 --> 10:18.717
The kid's basically veal.

10:25.458 --> 10:28.994
Mike, what --
what the heck are you doing?

10:28.996 --> 10:32.297
Have you seen the movie
"field of dreams"?
No.

10:32.299 --> 10:35.166
Well, go watch it
while I build my hockey rink.

10:46.979 --> 10:48.279
All right, score it.

10:48.281 --> 10:50.649
Slap that biscuit
between the pipes!

10:50.651 --> 10:54.252
Hey!
Hey, come on!

10:54.254 --> 10:55.320
That was slashing.

10:55.322 --> 10:57.022
Go back
to the penalty box.

10:57.024 --> 10:58.657
I've been to the box
like three times already,

10:58.659 --> 10:59.858
Not a drop of blood
on the ice.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.626
What kind of outfit
are you running here, dad?

11:01.628 --> 11:03.962
Sit out.
All right, penalty shot.

11:03.964 --> 11:06.097
You get a free shot.
I want you to charge the net.

11:06.099 --> 11:08.333
Let's go. Come at me.
Come on! Shoot it!

11:08.335 --> 11:09.834
Yay!

11:09.836 --> 11:11.503
Hooray for Boyd!

11:11.505 --> 11:14.339
That's not bad
for just doing this a week, kid.

11:14.341 --> 11:17.142
That's 'cause
the goalie's a sieve!

11:17.144 --> 11:19.344
Power play's over.
I'm out, people.

11:19.346 --> 11:20.512
All right!

11:20.514 --> 11:23.515
♪ now I get to score
on Eve ♪

11:23.517 --> 11:25.183
That's a fat chance,
little man,

11:25.185 --> 11:27.285
'cause only the lord
saves more than I do.

11:27.287 --> 11:29.621
Bring it.
Okay, go for the five hole,
five hole!

11:29.623 --> 11:31.890
Thanks, grandpa.
What's the five hole?

11:32.825 --> 11:34.526
Just shoot the puck.

11:34.528 --> 11:37.529
Oh-ho! Look at that.

11:37.531 --> 11:40.365
There's only seven things
on earth you can see from space,

11:40.367 --> 11:42.534
And one of them
is the great wall of Eve.

11:44.370 --> 11:48.473
Honey, you really think this
is gonna help calm Boyd down?

11:48.475 --> 11:53.044
Probably not as much
as a big mug of coffee.

11:53.046 --> 11:56.314
I guess I just don't understand
little boys very much.

11:56.316 --> 11:58.216
Never had one of my own.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.551
Closest was Eve.

11:59.553 --> 12:01.319
That's rough.

12:01.321 --> 12:03.221
Why don't you bring
the smack talk out here, lady?

12:03.223 --> 12:05.090
Bring it!

12:07.526 --> 12:10.395
Guess what -- guess
who totally crushed finals!

12:10.397 --> 12:12.564
Oh, my god! Wow!

12:12.566 --> 12:14.733
Hopefully the kid
you copied off of.

12:14.735 --> 12:18.069
Four b's, one a-minus --
pretty much straight a's!

12:18.071 --> 12:20.405
Aw, honey,
we are so proud of you.

12:20.407 --> 12:21.573
Thank you! I know.

12:21.575 --> 12:23.742
I've never gotten a vowel
on a report card before.

12:23.744 --> 12:25.276
This is amazing.
Thank you.

12:25.278 --> 12:27.512
I'm so proud of you.
Thank you very much.

12:27.514 --> 12:29.514
Suck it, haters!

12:29.516 --> 12:31.082
Great, Mike.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.217
I go on a run for four days,

12:32.219 --> 12:33.952
And while I'm gone,
you're teaching Boyd hockey.

12:33.954 --> 12:37.589
I just wanted a winter activity
to burn off a little energy.

12:37.591 --> 12:39.023
We tried pair skating,

12:39.025 --> 12:41.092
But the little tyke just
couldn't hold me over his head.

12:43.462 --> 12:46.197
Really wish
you'd ask me, Mike.

12:46.199 --> 12:47.532
I'm canadian, okay?
I know.

12:47.534 --> 12:48.600
I love hockey.

12:48.602 --> 12:49.734
You know, but growing up,

12:49.736 --> 12:51.402
I learned more
of the european style.

12:51.404 --> 12:53.371
It was graceful skating
and teamwork.

12:53.373 --> 12:54.639
There was no body checking.

12:54.641 --> 12:56.441
So, basically, ice capades.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.443
Why does America
always have to

12:58.445 --> 13:01.045
Take something elegant
and make it violent?

13:01.047 --> 13:02.447
Soccer becomes the nfl.

13:02.449 --> 13:05.316
Tai chi becomes the ultimate
fighting championship.

13:05.318 --> 13:09.087
We take boring things,
and we make them fun.

13:09.089 --> 13:10.822
I was skeptical at first,
too, Ryan,

13:10.824 --> 13:12.924
But I think it's doing Boyd
a world of good.

13:12.926 --> 13:16.094
Yeah, you might be right.
Can't argue with your results.

13:16.096 --> 13:19.397
Wow. It makes me uncomfortable
when you agree with me.

13:19.399 --> 13:21.466
Miss snyder has said
she's seen definite improvement.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.468
I'm not sure it's what
you've been doing, Vanessa,

13:23.470 --> 13:24.636
Or the hockey, but...

13:24.638 --> 13:26.971
It's the hockey.
No, no, I --

13:26.973 --> 13:29.874
I think our rhythmic drumming
has been a factor, too.

13:31.010 --> 13:33.511
It's the hockey.

13:33.513 --> 13:35.180
Either way,
it's great news.

13:35.182 --> 13:36.681
Yeah, it is great news.

13:36.683 --> 13:38.516
All right, well,
if Boyd's gonna learn hockey,

13:38.518 --> 13:40.652
I better get out there
and teach him some of my moves.

13:40.654 --> 13:42.487
How about this move?
How to stop.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.791
I guess we can
get rid of these, huh?

13:46.793 --> 13:48.593
Oh, Mike.

13:48.595 --> 13:51.763
A bunch of these pills
are missing.
Yeah?

13:51.765 --> 13:55.266
You don't think Kristin's been
giving them to Boyd, do you?

13:55.268 --> 13:56.768
I guess...

13:56.770 --> 13:59.103
That might explain why
he's improved so quickly.

13:59.105 --> 14:01.506
I think there might be
something else going on here.

14:01.508 --> 14:04.042
Mandy, can you
come down here a minute?

14:04.044 --> 14:05.977
Mandy:
Yeah, just a second.

14:05.979 --> 14:09.347
I hope I'm wrong,
but what are the odds of that?

14:09.349 --> 14:11.182
Hey. What's up?

14:11.184 --> 14:12.617
I just want to talk
about your grades.

14:12.619 --> 14:13.718
Oh, okay. I'm sorry.

14:13.720 --> 14:15.687
I'll try to do better
next semes--

14:15.689 --> 14:17.956
No, hold up.
That is old Mandy.

14:17.958 --> 14:20.058
I'm smart now.

14:20.060 --> 14:23.728
Okay.
Let's talk range rovers.

14:23.730 --> 14:25.163
Listen, honey,
your mom and I

14:25.165 --> 14:26.698
Really are proud
of these grades.

14:26.700 --> 14:28.800
I just want to make sure
that you didn't do this

14:28.802 --> 14:31.202
With a little help
from some of these.

14:31.204 --> 14:34.572
Are you serious?

14:34.574 --> 14:36.541
Oh, my god.

14:36.543 --> 14:39.410
Studying for those finals
was, like, the hardest thing

14:39.412 --> 14:41.379
I've ever done
in my entire life,

14:41.381 --> 14:43.381
And you guys don't think
I could've done that on my own.

14:43.383 --> 14:45.516
Mom?
Yeah, I don't --
I don't know, honey.

14:45.518 --> 14:48.419
I mean, you've never gotten
grades like that before, and...

14:48.421 --> 14:50.521
You do have a history.

14:50.523 --> 14:52.590
Yeah, and I got
a b-plus in it.

14:55.728 --> 14:58.229
Honestly,
this really, really hurts.

14:58.231 --> 15:00.398
You guys have
no faith in me.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.733
Okay, all right.
You know what?

15:01.735 --> 15:03.668
We're sorry
we accused you, okay?
Thank you.

15:03.670 --> 15:04.969
Okay. All right.
Mike, right?

15:06.572 --> 15:08.606
Mike?

15:10.342 --> 15:12.143
What?

15:13.779 --> 15:16.581
Yes, it's true.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.383
A lot of <i>other</i> students

15:18.385 --> 15:22.186
Will use adhd meds to help them
study or take tests,

15:22.188 --> 15:24.389
But I wouldn't, personally.

15:24.391 --> 15:26.991
I just wouldn't.

15:29.628 --> 15:31.562
But it would
only be fair if I did,

15:31.564 --> 15:32.697
Because if you don't,

15:32.699 --> 15:34.832
You're basically
at a huge disadvantage.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.103
And even if I had taken them,

15:39.105 --> 15:42.273
How would that be any different
than energy drinks or coffee?

15:42.275 --> 15:43.841
But I didn't take them.

15:45.544 --> 15:47.679
Okay, I took them.

15:48.781 --> 15:52.650
But it's your fault for putting
so much pressure on me.

15:52.652 --> 15:54.953
I hate being right.

15:54.955 --> 15:56.154
No, you don't.

15:58.624 --> 15:59.958
You're right about that.

16:10.936 --> 16:13.271
Hey, thanks
for nothing, Kyle.

16:13.273 --> 16:14.439
You're welcome, sir.

16:14.441 --> 16:16.641
And there's more
where that came from.

16:16.643 --> 16:19.644
I'm talking about
Mandy popping pills.

16:19.646 --> 16:22.480
I swear, I had no idea
until she told me last night.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.582
You didn't notice that she was
behaving differently?

16:24.584 --> 16:27.251
No, all she's been doing
is studying really hard.

16:30.656 --> 16:32.490
Oh, my god.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.158
It was right there
in front of me.

16:34.160 --> 16:35.626
How could I
have missed it?

16:35.628 --> 16:38.196
Mike, come here.
You're gonna love this.

16:42.634 --> 16:44.802
I don't want
to love that.

16:44.804 --> 16:46.637
No.

16:46.639 --> 16:48.973
Salesman
just dropped her off.

16:48.975 --> 16:50.441
Wants the store
to carry it.

16:50.443 --> 16:51.709
Want me
to shut the blinds

16:51.711 --> 16:53.378
And give you two
a little privacy?

16:55.314 --> 16:58.549
He says it's the latest in
must-have hunting gear, right?

16:58.551 --> 17:00.985
An anatomically correct doe.

17:00.987 --> 17:03.187
She attracts the buck
so you can shoot him.

17:03.189 --> 17:06.457
So, a doe ho.

17:06.459 --> 17:08.626
They call her
the "yes deer."

17:08.628 --> 17:10.962
It's actually
very compassionate.

17:10.964 --> 17:13.965
Buck goes out
with a smile on his face.

17:13.967 --> 17:16.034
Supposedly
makes the meat more tender.

17:16.036 --> 17:17.702
What's the sport in this?

17:17.704 --> 17:19.904
What's next?
We sell little deer downers?

17:19.906 --> 17:21.072
Get them so depressed

17:21.074 --> 17:23.641
They just stop by the camp
and shoot themselves?

17:23.643 --> 17:26.677
Look, not everybody's as expert
a hunter as you and me.

17:26.679 --> 17:29.881
Some people just like to sit
in their heated camping chair,

17:29.883 --> 17:34.252
Enjoy the show,
and then shoot the leading man.

17:34.254 --> 17:35.753
It's a short cut.

17:35.755 --> 17:39.557
It's like Mandy taking those
adhd meds just to pass a test.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.826
If that's the only drug
she's doing in college,

17:41.828 --> 17:43.728
You should
consider yourself lucky.

17:43.730 --> 17:47.098
When I was her age, I popped
a pill in san francisco,

17:47.100 --> 17:49.934
Wound up naked
in a meat locker in chicago.

17:49.936 --> 17:53.604
You know, people say
you should write a book, um...

17:53.606 --> 17:56.340
Don't do it.
Okay.

17:56.342 --> 17:58.709
It's cheating.
That's how I look at it.

17:58.711 --> 18:01.245
Mandy taking those adhd meds
to pass a test

18:01.247 --> 18:03.347
Is just like the athletes
taking steroids. It's cheating.

18:03.349 --> 18:04.749
Mike, Mike, these guys like

18:04.751 --> 18:06.584
Jose canseco
and lance armstrong,

18:06.586 --> 18:08.186
They were great
before they started juicing.
So what?

18:08.188 --> 18:09.520
They still --
it was against the law.

18:09.522 --> 18:11.022
The drugs just enhanced
their god-given ability.

18:11.024 --> 18:13.024
Yeah, but Mandy was never
as good a student

18:13.026 --> 18:14.592
As canseco was
on the ball field.

18:14.594 --> 18:18.396
Hell, she was never as good
a student as <i>he</i> was a student.

18:18.398 --> 18:19.897
Right, right.

18:19.899 --> 18:21.966
Right, but she took the meds,
and she's doing better now.

18:21.968 --> 18:23.701
She's actually
doing really good.

18:23.703 --> 18:27.605
Well, maybe she does have
this -- this aarp thing.

18:28.874 --> 18:31.576
If you take pills and you're
not sick, then that's cheating.

18:31.578 --> 18:33.978
If you take pills and you
need them, that's medicine.

18:33.980 --> 18:35.880
I guess.
Yeah. All right, so --

18:35.882 --> 18:38.082
All right, so,
what do you think, Mike, huh?

18:38.084 --> 18:39.750
Do we keep this? Huh?

18:39.752 --> 18:42.753
Take it downstairs and introduce
it to the stuffed otter.

18:42.755 --> 18:44.956
We'll see what happens.

18:48.961 --> 18:50.595
Ryan: Okay, Boyd,
share the puck.

18:50.597 --> 18:52.130
Remember,
we're finesse players.

18:52.132 --> 18:53.164
No dump and grind here.

18:53.166 --> 18:55.266
Oh, there it is.
Here it goes! One time!

18:55.268 --> 18:56.634
Oh, yeah!

18:56.636 --> 18:59.437
The Ryan-ator's
still got it. Ooh!

18:59.439 --> 19:02.907
Okay, that's a penalty --
dancing like a white guy.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.444
Into the box, Ryan-ator.

19:06.446 --> 19:08.446
You know, I got to admit,

19:08.448 --> 19:10.481
This is working out
pretty great.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.817
No more e-mails
from Boyd's teacher,

19:12.819 --> 19:14.986
I get to date
a hockey player...

19:14.988 --> 19:18.823
Ugh. Keep it in your pants,
puck bunny.

19:18.825 --> 19:21.526
Well, I'm off to Kyle's
to study, but don't worry --

19:21.528 --> 19:23.027
I will try
not to learn anything

19:23.029 --> 19:24.695
So you guys don't think
I'm on drugs.

19:24.697 --> 19:26.531
Mandy, honey,
come here a minute.

19:26.533 --> 19:27.865
What you did was serious --

19:27.867 --> 19:30.334
You took pills that were
not prescribed for you.

19:30.336 --> 19:31.636
You could end up

19:31.638 --> 19:34.338
In a meat locker
in chicago, naked.

19:34.340 --> 19:35.840
Oh.

19:35.842 --> 19:38.009
Okay. I know.

19:38.011 --> 19:39.510
I'm sorry, all right?

19:39.512 --> 19:43.281
Just it felt really good
to do well on a test for once.

19:43.283 --> 19:45.950
Other people were
trying to copy off of me.

19:45.952 --> 19:47.785
You know, I got to be
the jerk doing this.

19:47.787 --> 19:50.388
Like, "oh."
[ chuckles ]

19:50.390 --> 19:53.057
"oh, man, it's so easy."

19:53.059 --> 19:57.495
Honey, your father and I always
knew you could be that jerk.

19:57.497 --> 20:00.331
Thanks, mom.

20:00.333 --> 20:03.501
You know, honey, we're really
proud of what you did,

20:03.503 --> 20:06.871
But your mom and I think
you actually may have adh--

20:06.873 --> 20:09.440
Hey, have we always had
an ice rink in the yard?

20:14.846 --> 20:16.681
...D.

20:16.683 --> 20:19.917
Uh, Mandy,
you know, honey, we --

20:19.919 --> 20:22.220
We could take you to a doctor
to be evaluated,

20:22.222 --> 20:24.155
And -- and if he thinks
you have it,

20:24.157 --> 20:25.756
You could get
your own prescription.

20:25.758 --> 20:28.226
No, the rink
is definitely new.

20:28.228 --> 20:30.228
It wasn't here last summer.

20:30.230 --> 20:32.964
You guys!

20:33.899 --> 20:36.033
Maybe the doctor's
open late.

20:43.775 --> 20:45.276
Dinner's ready!

20:45.278 --> 20:46.844
Honey, where's Boyd?

20:46.846 --> 20:49.547
In the living room,
working up a little appetite.

20:49.549 --> 20:51.515
Boyd:
Be there in a second!

20:51.517 --> 20:55.253
Save some mac
and cheese for me!

20:59.725 --> 21:01.292
Boyd.

21:01.294 --> 21:02.960
Hey, hey, hey!

21:02.962 --> 21:05.062
Try to punch the weak spot --
the corners.

21:05.064 --> 21:06.864
Go for the corners.
Short punches.

21:06.866 --> 21:08.266
Come on!

21:11.436 --> 21:15.439
Grandpa, I think
I'm running out of air.

21:15.441 --> 21:18.142
Well, there's plenty
of air out here. Keep punching!
