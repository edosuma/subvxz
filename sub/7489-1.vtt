WEBVTT

00:05.125 --> 00:08.522
You're still carving that pumpkin?
It's been hours.

00:08.523 --> 00:12.526
It takes time to capture the
perfection that is Austin's face.

00:12.527 --> 00:14.628
Almost done.

00:14.629 --> 00:16.609
Voila!

00:16.940 --> 00:20.052
Amazing. It looks
just like Austin.

00:20.053 --> 00:22.550
Except my hair's parted
on the other side.

00:22.551 --> 00:24.051
Oh, man.

00:24.052 --> 00:27.412
Guess I gotta start over.

00:29.310 --> 00:31.110
Oh.

00:32.093 --> 00:36.517
Guess who got a job at
the Halloweenatorium?

00:36.518 --> 00:38.318
So are you on a break, Trish?

00:38.319 --> 00:42.159
Want to go grab a sand- "witch"?

00:44.087 --> 00:47.461
You're gonna high-five
her for that?

00:47.462 --> 00:50.330
Austin Moon, my
favorite new artist.

00:50.331 --> 00:53.433
Jimmy Starr, my favorite new...

00:53.434 --> 00:57.604
Guy who signed me to
his record label.

00:57.605 --> 00:59.273
That's me.

00:59.274 --> 01:02.509
I wanted to invite you kids to the Starr
Records Halloween party this Saturday.

01:02.510 --> 01:03.765
- What?
- No way!

01:03.766 --> 01:06.346
That's the coolest
Halloween party in Miami.

01:06.347 --> 01:09.249
I heard usher was there last year.
Who's gonna be there this year?

01:09.250 --> 01:10.804
Beyonce? Katy Perry?

01:10.805 --> 01:12.486
A lot of big stars will be
there, but you won't know

01:12.487 --> 01:14.354
who's who because they'll
all be in costume.

01:14.355 --> 01:15.239
Oh.

01:15.240 --> 01:18.158
I just got an RSVP
from Taylor Swift.

01:18.159 --> 01:20.022
- Taylor Swift?
- No way! I love her!

01:20.023 --> 01:25.265
Perfect. I can finally give her
this pumpkin I carved of her.

01:25.266 --> 01:27.568
I think she's wearing
her hair straight now.

01:27.569 --> 01:29.369
Oh, man!

01:29.370 --> 01:31.170
Oh!

01:32.985 --> 01:36.643
Stay away from
Taylor at the party.

01:36.644 --> 01:37.975
Now, here's the deal.

01:37.976 --> 01:41.422
I want you guys to write a new
song for Austin to perform.

01:41.423 --> 01:44.384
I'm performing for a bunch of stars?
How awesome is that, Ally?

01:44.385 --> 01:49.356
Totally awesome. We get to write a song
that the biggest names in music will hear.

01:49.357 --> 01:52.225
Halloween just got
a lot scarier.

01:52.226 --> 01:54.959
You'll be fine.
There's the invite.

01:54.960 --> 01:57.010
Cool, it's at
Brownstone Mansion.

01:57.011 --> 01:59.266
Ooh, I heard that
place is haunted.

02:06.608 --> 02:11.108
Mysterious red slime
oozes from the walls.

02:12.833 --> 02:16.350
Well, at least that's what
it says on the brochure.

02:16.351 --> 02:17.417
See you guys there.

02:17.418 --> 02:20.220
- Bye.
- See you, Jimmy.

02:20.221 --> 02:22.224
Trish, I want to get a cool
costume for the party.

02:22.225 --> 02:23.523
You working tomorrow?

02:23.524 --> 02:28.866
Well, I was planning on getting
fired later this afternoon.

02:28.867 --> 02:32.220
But I guess I can push it one more
day so you can get a discount.

02:32.221 --> 02:34.081
Yes!

02:36.558 --> 02:39.660
<i>When the crowd wants more,
I bring on the thunder.</i>

02:39.661 --> 02:42.795
<i>'Cause you've got my back,
and I'm not going under.</i>

02:42.796 --> 02:44.327
<i>You're my point,
you're my guard.</i>

02:44.328 --> 02:45.946
<i>You're the perfect chord.</i>

02:45.947 --> 02:48.991
<i>And I see our names together
on every billboard.</i>

02:48.992 --> 02:52.050
<i>We're headed for the top,
we've got it on lock.</i>

02:52.051 --> 02:53.664
<i>We'll make 'em say "hey!"</i>

02:53.665 --> 02:55.987
<i>And we'll keep rockin'.</i>

02:55.988 --> 03:00.125
<i>Oh, there's no way I could
make it without ya.</i>

03:00.126 --> 03:03.161
<i>Do it without ya,
be here without ya.</i>

03:03.162 --> 03:06.231
<i>It's no fun when
you're doing it solo.</i>

03:06.232 --> 03:09.554
<i>With you it's like, "whoa".
Yeah, and I know.</i>

03:09.555 --> 03:12.204
<i>I own this dream.</i>

03:12.205 --> 03:15.582
<i>'Cause I got you with me.</i>

03:15.583 --> 03:18.700
<i>There's no way I could
make it without ya.</i>

03:18.701 --> 03:23.021
<i>Do it without ya,
be here without ya.</i>

03:28.554 --> 03:32.913
Okay. When you think of
Halloween, you think of costumes.

03:32.914 --> 03:36.950
Ooh! Maybe the song could be about
the mask we all hide behind.

03:36.951 --> 03:39.591
Like this? Aah!

03:39.695 --> 03:41.713
Austin!

03:41.714 --> 03:43.204
Sorry.

03:43.205 --> 03:45.899
I'm getting us in the mood
to write a Halloween song.

03:45.900 --> 03:48.399
Let's think of things that scare us.
You go first.

03:48.400 --> 03:51.977
Well, obviously I'm scared of
performing in front of people.

03:51.978 --> 03:55.370
Ooh! Sometimes when I burp, I'm
afraid there's an alien in my stomach

03:55.371 --> 03:57.938
trying to bust out.

03:57.939 --> 04:00.055
Don't you have any
fears that aren't...

04:00.056 --> 04:03.606
I don't know,
absolutely ridiculous?

04:03.607 --> 04:07.667
I am kind of freaked out about singing in
front of all those stars at the party.

04:07.668 --> 04:10.754
That makes sense. That's
a lot of pressure.

04:10.755 --> 04:13.691
Remember what you told me that
time we went to the water park

04:13.692 --> 04:15.891
and I was scared to go down
the giant water slide?

04:15.892 --> 04:21.733
Keep your mouth closed at the bottom.
There might be pee in the pool?

04:21.733 --> 04:22.767
Yes.

04:22.768 --> 04:28.668
But you also said no matter how scared I
was, just push ahead and don't look down.

04:30.008 --> 04:32.443
Hey, that could
be a cool chorus.

04:32.444 --> 04:34.312
Yeah.

04:34.313 --> 04:37.022
Don't drink the pee
in the pool...

04:37.023 --> 04:39.206
No no no.

04:39.207 --> 04:42.867
No. I meant don't look down.

04:43.144 --> 04:45.927
Don't look down...

04:45.928 --> 04:49.108
Yeah, that's good too.

04:53.666 --> 04:57.702
Trish, put this pirate costume on the top
shelf, these vampire fangs in aisle seven,

04:57.703 --> 04:59.704
and these swords in
the display window.

04:59.705 --> 05:03.305
I'll get right on it, boss.

05:06.088 --> 05:07.545
Can you help me?

05:07.546 --> 05:10.343
Does it look like I work here?

05:10.344 --> 05:12.705
You're sitting
behind the counter.

05:12.706 --> 05:14.184
Fine.

05:14.185 --> 05:18.099
Oh, how may I help you,
oh valued customer?

05:18.100 --> 05:20.334
Do you have a Charles
Lindbergh costume?

05:20.335 --> 05:23.294
Charles who-to-the-what-now?

05:23.295 --> 05:24.528
Lindbergh.

05:24.529 --> 05:26.820
First man to fly a plane
across the Atlantic. And...

05:26.821 --> 05:28.334
Boring.

05:28.335 --> 05:32.895
Here's an old pilot costume.
Now go away.

05:34.707 --> 05:37.907
Hey, Dez. Great costume.

05:37.908 --> 05:41.579
But didn't you go as
an idiot last year?

05:41.580 --> 05:43.191
Uh, no.

05:43.192 --> 05:45.073
This year my costume's
gonna be a surprise.

05:45.074 --> 05:48.353
I'm just testing out my ghost
hunting kit for the party.

05:48.354 --> 05:50.421
That junk doesn't work.

05:50.422 --> 05:51.756
Oh, really?

05:51.757 --> 05:55.077
Well, my ghost detector says
this isn't a real ghost.

05:55.078 --> 05:57.658
See? It works.

05:59.209 --> 06:00.993
Trish, you messed up.

06:00.994 --> 06:04.958
I asked for a caveman costume
and you gave me a cake man.

06:04.959 --> 06:08.370
Well, I'm going as a cave
woman, so pick something else.

06:08.371 --> 06:10.472
Fine, what about a...

06:10.473 --> 06:12.633
A ninja?

06:13.677 --> 06:17.546
Ninja costumes are all
the way upstairs.

06:17.547 --> 06:20.091
Oh! Be a gladiator.

06:20.092 --> 06:23.519
Oh, a gladiator! Now I
can show off my muscles.

06:23.520 --> 06:25.800
Boom boom.

06:27.624 --> 06:32.124
Works better when I'm
not inside a cake.

06:32.595 --> 06:34.630
So, what do you think of this?

06:34.631 --> 06:36.532
You can't go wrong
being a cute nurse.

06:36.533 --> 06:39.137
I'm not just any cute nurse.

06:39.138 --> 06:43.305
I'm Florence Nightingale.
Founder of modern nursing.

06:43.306 --> 06:46.575
You know what? I think I found
the perfect guy for you.

06:46.576 --> 06:48.252
He's cute, and...

06:48.253 --> 06:51.161
- Do you know who Charles Lindbergh is?
- Duh. Only the first guy to...

06:51.162 --> 06:55.542
He's right over there.
Go talk to him.

06:55.652 --> 06:57.537
Okay, Ally. You can do this.

06:57.538 --> 07:00.958
Just say, "hi. I'm Ally."

07:01.123 --> 07:02.860
Hi. I'm Ally.

07:02.861 --> 07:04.402
I'm Ethan.

07:04.403 --> 07:06.825
Nice Florence
Nightingale costume.

07:06.826 --> 07:09.312
He likes my costume.
Say something funny.

07:09.313 --> 07:12.193
Yep. Good old Flo.

07:14.884 --> 07:16.947
That was not funny.

07:16.948 --> 07:19.708
Nice meeting you.

07:20.204 --> 07:22.511
Nice meeting you too.

07:22.512 --> 07:26.448
Would have been a good
thing to say out loud.

07:26.449 --> 07:29.569
Hey, I've seen worse.

07:29.669 --> 07:32.454
I wish I could be more
confident and cool.

07:32.455 --> 07:35.324
It's Halloween. You can
be anything you want.

07:35.325 --> 07:36.768
You're right.

07:36.769 --> 07:39.469
I'm gonna be...

07:39.496 --> 07:41.296
Galexis Nova!

07:41.297 --> 07:43.565
I love Galexis Nova!

07:43.566 --> 07:46.160
Mild-mannered nuclear
physicist by day.

07:46.161 --> 07:49.141
Butt-kicking intergalactic
avenger by night.

07:49.142 --> 07:52.541
She's confident and fearless.

07:52.542 --> 07:55.388
You're never gonna pull it off.

07:55.389 --> 07:56.812
Hey, that's not nice.

07:56.813 --> 07:59.115
No, I mean she's never gonna
pull it off the mannequin.

07:59.116 --> 08:02.056
The zipper's stuck.

08:03.275 --> 08:06.261
Uh, I'll... I'll get
my costume later.

08:06.262 --> 08:09.830
I have to go. I'm meeting
someone for lunch.

08:09.831 --> 08:12.163
Really, who?

08:12.164 --> 08:14.744
I don't know.

08:17.200 --> 08:20.440
Well, that's suspicious.

08:22.286 --> 08:24.136
What's that all about?

08:24.137 --> 08:26.717
I don't know.

08:28.031 --> 08:29.470
But let's go find out.

08:29.471 --> 08:31.573
I'll bring this
costume back later.

08:31.574 --> 08:34.034
Like I care.

08:36.000 --> 08:42.073
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:43.293 --> 08:45.249
There's Ally.

08:45.250 --> 08:48.430
Why is she with Jimmy?

08:50.333 --> 08:53.669
Why are you staring
at me like that?

08:53.670 --> 08:57.270
I'm just really hungry, man.

09:03.646 --> 09:06.181
What could they be talking
about without me?

09:06.182 --> 09:07.483
Let's find out.

09:07.484 --> 09:12.621
My ghost hunting kit came with
a supersonic sound sensor.

09:12.622 --> 09:14.256
What are they saying?

09:14.257 --> 09:16.343
Well, she asked him if
he had a poopy diaper,

09:16.344 --> 09:20.529
and then he said,
"goo goo ga ga goo."

09:20.530 --> 09:23.945
Dez, you're pointing
at the wrong people.

09:23.946 --> 09:26.568
Give me those. Come on.

09:26.569 --> 09:29.538
I know you wrote it for Austin, but I
played "don't look down" for Taylor Swift,

09:29.539 --> 09:30.539
and she loved it.

09:30.540 --> 09:32.341
She wants to sing
it at the party.

09:32.342 --> 09:33.927
You're kidding.

09:33.928 --> 09:37.965
Taylor Swift wants
to sing my song?

09:37.966 --> 09:41.673
Don't say anything to Austin.
This is just between you and me.

09:41.674 --> 09:45.214
It'll be our little secret.

09:47.738 --> 09:51.750
That was supposed to be my song. I
can't believe she's giving it away.

09:51.751 --> 09:57.651
I can't believe Danny's taking Sarah's
sister to The Prom instead of her.

09:57.783 --> 09:59.883
<i>Drama...</i>

10:11.048 --> 10:15.952
I'm so mad at Ally and Jimmy for giving
away my song, I just want to yell at them!

10:15.953 --> 10:17.309
Oh. Bad idea.

10:17.310 --> 10:20.352
Jimmy's the head of your label.
He can cancel your record deal.

10:20.353 --> 10:21.542
What should I do?

10:21.543 --> 10:24.276
Well, I do know one technique
for dealing with anger.

10:24.277 --> 10:26.309
You write a message to the
person you're upset with.

10:26.310 --> 10:28.810
Tell them how you feel. Then
you get rid of that message.

10:28.811 --> 10:34.317
Symbolically purging the
negativity of your inner psyche.

10:34.318 --> 10:37.798
Okay. I'll give it a try.

10:38.489 --> 10:41.591
"Dear Ally and Jimmy, I'm so..."

10:41.592 --> 10:43.095
"Mad at you guys right now."

10:43.096 --> 10:46.066
"I don't want anything to
do with people who are..."

10:46.067 --> 10:47.397
"Evil gutless rats!"

10:47.398 --> 10:50.158
Oh that is good.

10:51.469 --> 10:54.404
Dez, Dez it worked. I
feel better already.

10:54.405 --> 10:59.745
That's because it's out of
here, and up into here.

11:01.379 --> 11:03.950
Wow, Dez. That's really smart.

11:03.951 --> 11:05.282
Thanks, buddy.

11:05.283 --> 11:08.809
Now we just need to get rid of this text.
Just hit the "don't send" button.

11:08.810 --> 11:10.120
Don't send?

11:10.121 --> 11:12.110
There's no don't send button!
You sent the text!

11:12.111 --> 11:14.151
Oopsie!

11:14.169 --> 11:16.459
What are we gonna do? I don't
want Ally or Jimmy reading that.

11:16.460 --> 11:19.811
Okay. Let's just calm down. It takes
a while for a text to go through.

11:19.812 --> 11:21.812
Evil gutless rats?!

11:21.813 --> 11:23.519
I can explain.

11:23.520 --> 11:25.860
I was mad at you and Jimmy,
so Dez made me do this thing

11:25.861 --> 11:27.504
where I write my feelings
down and not send them.

11:27.505 --> 11:30.119
And then he... He sent them.

11:30.120 --> 11:32.209
Dez! Do you realize
what you've done?

11:32.210 --> 11:33.547
Yes!

11:33.548 --> 11:37.480
I've cured my
friend of his rage.

11:37.481 --> 11:39.316
Why were you so angry?

11:39.317 --> 11:42.837
Because you and Jimmy gave the
song we wrote to Taylor Swift.

11:42.838 --> 11:46.213
We sent it to her because Jimmy
wanted you guys to sing a duet.

11:46.214 --> 11:48.191
It was supposed
to be a surprise.

11:48.192 --> 11:50.554
I'm singing with Taylor Swift?

11:50.555 --> 11:52.093
That's awesome.

11:52.094 --> 11:54.254
What up?

11:54.925 --> 12:00.825
You know you called the head of your
record label an evil gutless rat?

12:00.983 --> 12:03.023
Uh-oh.

12:04.242 --> 12:06.683
Jimmy's gonna be furious
when he reads it.

12:06.684 --> 12:10.385
Maybe we can get his phone at the party and
delete the message before he reads it.

12:10.386 --> 12:13.691
In the meantime, let's flood
his in box with new messages

12:13.692 --> 12:15.775
so he won't get a chance
to read Austin's text.

12:15.776 --> 12:17.344
Yes.

12:17.345 --> 12:21.614
"Hey J-Starr, it's T-Swift.
Looking forward to your party."

12:21.615 --> 12:24.651
"Hey Jimmy, it's Austin. You
are an evil gutless rat."

12:24.652 --> 12:28.432
"Looking forward to your party."

12:38.676 --> 12:41.768
Oh. Hey, there's Austin.

12:41.769 --> 12:45.609
Why isn't he wearing a costume?

12:45.812 --> 12:47.607
Did you find Jimmy yet, Austin?

12:47.608 --> 12:52.108
<i>Ha! Made you do a double take!
Oh yeah.</i>

12:52.413 --> 12:55.035
Wow. Great costume.

12:55.036 --> 12:57.436
Lousy voice.

12:58.419 --> 13:00.520
Hey, guys. Where's Jimmy?

13:00.521 --> 13:03.556
Wow. You two look amazing.

13:03.557 --> 13:05.525
Whoa. You're me!

13:05.526 --> 13:07.299
<i>D-d-d double take.</i>

13:07.300 --> 13:08.661
Boom.

13:08.662 --> 13:10.809
I hope you don't mind. I
borrowed your clothes.

13:10.810 --> 13:12.599
As long as you're not
wearing my lucky underwear.

13:12.600 --> 13:15.149
Oh, I'm not wearing
any underwear.

13:15.150 --> 13:17.980
You can keep the pants.

13:17.981 --> 13:22.121
We gotta find Jimmy.
I'll call him.

13:24.054 --> 13:26.233
- Hello?
- That's him!

13:26.234 --> 13:27.973
- Hey!
- Hey!

13:27.974 --> 13:29.866
No, that's not him.
It's still ringing.

13:29.867 --> 13:31.681
Hey!

13:31.682 --> 13:33.062
You're not Jimmy!

13:33.063 --> 13:35.631
- What are you doing?
- Well, uh...

13:35.632 --> 13:40.552
Bobbing for phones! It's
a Halloween tradition.

13:48.010 --> 13:49.930
Uh...

13:50.870 --> 13:52.384
Jimmy?

13:52.385 --> 13:53.922
Jimmy?

13:53.923 --> 13:55.417
Jimmy? Jimmy?

13:55.418 --> 13:57.353
Oh, hey, J-Lo.

13:57.354 --> 13:58.838
- Ally!
- Right.

13:58.839 --> 14:00.008
Jimmy?

14:00.009 --> 14:01.957
I wish we knew what
costume he was wearing.

14:01.958 --> 14:03.993
I know what costume
he's not wearing.

14:03.994 --> 14:07.445
Austin Moon. Because
I am the only one.

14:07.446 --> 14:09.089
Hey, Austin.

14:09.090 --> 14:11.207
Aw, nartz!

14:11.208 --> 14:14.688
<i>Make you do a double take.</i>

14:14.779 --> 14:16.639
Mmm!

14:16.688 --> 14:19.443
Wow. It's like I'm
looking in a mirror.

14:19.444 --> 14:21.340
A really tiny mirror.

14:21.341 --> 14:23.201
Bam!

14:24.382 --> 14:26.955
We have to find Jimmy
before he reads that text.

14:26.956 --> 14:28.352
Let's split up.

14:28.353 --> 14:30.454
Uh, have you never
seen a horror movie?

14:30.455 --> 14:32.456
You can't just split
up in a haunted house.

14:32.457 --> 14:34.391
That's when one of the
teenagers gets it.

14:34.392 --> 14:37.461
Let's hope it's the tall goofy one.
We're splitting up.

14:37.462 --> 14:42.442
Hold on. Picking up something
cold and soulless.

14:43.368 --> 14:46.308
Oh, hey. It's you.

14:48.950 --> 14:50.967
Jimmy? Jimmy?

14:50.968 --> 14:53.428
Jimmy! Sorry.

14:54.009 --> 14:55.673
Jimmy?

14:55.674 --> 14:57.907
Hey, nice costume.

14:57.908 --> 14:59.673
I'm Ethan.

14:59.674 --> 15:02.557
I know who you are.
We've already met.

15:02.558 --> 15:04.041
We have?

15:04.042 --> 15:06.554
He doesn't recognize me!

15:06.555 --> 15:09.485
Hi, I'm Galexis Nova.

15:09.486 --> 15:13.732
I guess that makes me
Charles Lindbergh.

15:13.733 --> 15:16.094
Nice banter. We're
off to a good start.

15:16.095 --> 15:17.860
Now hit him with some knowledge.

15:17.861 --> 15:20.129
A little known fact about
you, Mister Lindbergh,

15:20.130 --> 15:22.899
you developed the first
artificial heart.

15:22.900 --> 15:25.835
Wow. Cute and smart.

15:25.836 --> 15:27.935
Hey, can I get your number?

15:27.936 --> 15:31.021
He wants my number? He
wants my number! Yes!

15:31.022 --> 15:32.882
Yes!

15:33.877 --> 15:38.077
I didn't give him
my number, did I?

15:41.018 --> 15:42.998
Jimmy?

15:43.158 --> 15:45.096
Jimmy, I've been
looking for you.

15:45.097 --> 15:46.860
Well, I've been
looking for you too.

15:46.861 --> 15:48.727
Oh, man. You checked your phone?

15:48.728 --> 15:50.478
No, I've been too busy working.

15:50.479 --> 15:52.339
Yes!

15:52.757 --> 15:54.607
Anyway I got a big surprise.

15:54.608 --> 15:56.886
Taylor Swift's gonna be
performing with you.

15:56.887 --> 15:58.395
Oh, what?

15:58.396 --> 16:01.150
Taylor Swift? Oh, wow.

16:01.151 --> 16:06.431
That is... That is a surprise
that I did not know.

16:07.027 --> 16:10.237
Guys, great news. I'm
performing with Taylor Swift.

16:10.238 --> 16:11.474
Oh.

16:11.475 --> 16:13.943
- And Jimmy didn't check his phone.
- Oh!

16:13.944 --> 16:16.036
We still need to
delete the messages.

16:16.037 --> 16:18.430
Galexis Nova's got this.

16:18.431 --> 16:21.397
Hey, Jimmy. Can I borrow your phone?
I need to text my dad.

16:21.398 --> 16:23.418
Here, you can borrow mine.

16:23.419 --> 16:25.759
She can't!

16:30.522 --> 16:33.086
"Hey, dad. Still at the party."

16:33.087 --> 16:35.188
Nah, I don't like that text.

16:35.189 --> 16:37.224
I'm gonna delete it.

16:37.225 --> 16:38.859
Delete.

16:38.860 --> 16:41.128
Delete delete delete delete
delete delete delete.

16:41.129 --> 16:43.523
You know, I don't need
to text my dad anymore.

16:43.524 --> 16:44.640
Thanks.

16:44.641 --> 16:47.000
You're welcome?

16:47.001 --> 16:48.568
- Yes!
- Yeah!

16:48.569 --> 16:51.067
I guess I can finally start
hunting some ghosts.

16:51.068 --> 16:56.943
Not that I believe any of that junk, but
they say upstairs is the most haunted.

16:56.944 --> 17:00.336
I should probably get ready for my
performance, so where's Taylor?

17:00.337 --> 17:02.677
Over there.

17:03.404 --> 17:06.920
Taylor Swift is dressed
as Galexis Nova, too?

17:06.921 --> 17:12.820
Much better than the Florence
Nightingale costume she wore last year.

17:18.766 --> 17:21.459
Well, ghost hunter,
finding anything?

17:21.460 --> 17:24.451
- Nothing yet.
- See? I told you.

17:24.452 --> 17:26.744
There are no ghosts.

17:26.746 --> 17:30.190
Oh yeah? Then what's
that moaning?

17:30.191 --> 17:33.851
It's coming from the chimney!

17:36.803 --> 17:40.163
What's that on the wall?

17:41.535 --> 17:44.104
Red slime oozing
out of the walls.

17:44.105 --> 17:46.125
Just like they said
in the brochure.

17:46.126 --> 17:48.407
I'm getting scared. There's
something in here.

17:48.408 --> 17:50.937
I can feel it.

17:50.938 --> 17:53.698
Dez! The chimney!

17:54.248 --> 17:56.948
It's the ghost!

17:58.519 --> 18:00.319
Ah!

18:00.454 --> 18:02.974
You hit Ally!

18:04.525 --> 18:06.292
Ally? Can you hear me?

18:06.293 --> 18:09.413
Yeah, I can hear you.

18:11.265 --> 18:13.399
That's not you?

18:13.400 --> 18:17.300
We just knocked
out Taylor Swift.

18:24.348 --> 18:26.215
Here you go.

18:26.216 --> 18:29.118
Taylor Swift can't perform.
This is all your fault, Dez.

18:29.119 --> 18:31.782
Don't blame me. Blame the ghost.

18:31.783 --> 18:34.708
There wasn't a ghost. Trish
was just messing with you.

18:34.709 --> 18:37.649
I know what I saw.

18:38.095 --> 18:42.688
What you saw was strawberry jam
on the walls and a fog machine.

18:42.689 --> 18:46.776
The ghost put strawberry jam on the
wall and a fog machine in the chimney?

18:46.777 --> 18:48.626
Yes, Dez. Yes, it did.

18:48.627 --> 18:51.545
I know ghosts were real.

18:51.546 --> 18:53.309
What are we gonna do?

18:53.310 --> 18:55.144
We should just tell
Jimmy the truth.

18:55.145 --> 18:57.276
Or maybe we could write all our
feelings down in a text message...

18:57.277 --> 18:58.949
No!

18:58.950 --> 19:00.857
We have a surprise tonight.

19:00.858 --> 19:04.350
Austin Moon will be performing
with a very special guest.

19:04.351 --> 19:06.811
Taylor Swift!

19:10.027 --> 19:11.806
Let's hear it for Taylor!

19:11.807 --> 19:13.773
Taylor! Taylor!

19:13.774 --> 19:15.241
We can't leave Austin hanging.

19:15.242 --> 19:19.914
Wait. Taylor and I are
wearing the same costume.

19:19.915 --> 19:23.973
Ally may have stage fright,
but Galexis Nova doesn't.

19:23.974 --> 19:25.942
I know what to do.

19:25.943 --> 19:28.978
I'll go on stage costume,
perform as Taylor Swift,

19:28.979 --> 19:31.363
and no one will know
the difference.

19:31.364 --> 19:33.921
Guys, I know what to do.

19:33.922 --> 19:36.463
I'll go on stage in costume,
perform as Taylor Swift...

19:36.464 --> 19:41.925
Yeah, we heard you the first time.
You were thinking out loud.

19:41.926 --> 19:44.160
Taylor! Taylor!

19:44.161 --> 19:45.676
Yeah!

19:45.677 --> 19:49.517
Yeah. I could get used to this.

19:50.986 --> 19:55.304
This song is called "don't look down". It
was written by my partner Ally Dawson.

19:55.305 --> 19:57.630
Austin, it's me, Ally.

19:57.631 --> 20:00.176
Taylor got hurt.

20:00.177 --> 20:02.011
Ally?

20:02.012 --> 20:04.588
I can't believe it. You're
actually gonna do this?

20:04.589 --> 20:06.677
Just like at the top
of the water slide.

20:06.678 --> 20:09.788
I'm gonna close my mouth
and not look down.

20:09.789 --> 20:15.369
Okay, but open your mouth
when it's your turn to sing.

20:15.959 --> 20:18.673
<i>Yeah.</i>

20:18.674 --> 20:21.583
<i>Whoa.</i>

20:21.584 --> 20:24.000
<i>I'm walking on a thin line.</i>

20:24.001 --> 20:25.788
<i>And my hands are tied.</i>

20:25.789 --> 20:28.727
<i>Got nowhere to hide.</i>

20:28.728 --> 20:31.213
<i>I'm standing at a crossroads.</i>

20:31.214 --> 20:33.009
<i>Don't know where to go.</i>

20:33.010 --> 20:34.944
<i>Feeling so exposed.</i>

20:34.945 --> 20:38.281
<i>Yeah, I'm caught, in between.</i>

20:38.282 --> 20:43.019
<i>Where I'm going and
where I've been.</i>

20:43.020 --> 20:47.818
<i>But I know there's
no turning back.</i>

20:47.819 --> 20:50.026
<i>Yeah.</i>

20:50.027 --> 20:53.996
<i>It's like I'm
balanced on the edge.</i>

20:53.997 --> 20:57.199
<i>It's like I'm hanging
by a thread.</i>

20:57.200 --> 21:00.102
<i>But I'm still gonna push ahead.</i>

21:00.103 --> 21:02.004
<i>So I tell myself.</i>

21:02.005 --> 21:03.724
<i>Yeah, I tell myself.</i>

21:03.725 --> 21:07.176
<i>Don't look down. Down down down.</i>

21:07.177 --> 21:10.913
<i>Don't look down. Down down down.</i>

21:10.914 --> 21:14.581
<i>Don't look down. Down down down.</i>

21:14.582 --> 21:19.121
<i>Don't look down. Down down down.</i>

21:19.122 --> 21:22.959
<i>It'd be so easy just to run.</i>

21:22.960 --> 21:26.669
<i>It'd be so easy to just give up.</i>

21:26.670 --> 21:29.198
<i>But I'm not that girl
who's gonna turn my back.</i>

21:29.199 --> 21:31.220
<i>There's no turning back.</i>

21:31.221 --> 21:33.970
<i>No turning back.</i>

21:33.971 --> 21:37.173
<i>It's like I'm
balanced on the edge.</i>

21:37.174 --> 21:41.110
<i>It's like I'm hanging
by a thread.</i>

21:41.111 --> 21:43.946
<i>But I'm still gonna push ahead.</i>

21:43.947 --> 21:47.407
<i>So I tell myself.
Yeah, I tell myself.</i>

21:47.408 --> 21:51.020
<i>Don't look down. Down down down.</i>

21:51.021 --> 21:54.704
<i>Don't look down down. Down down.</i>

21:54.705 --> 21:57.711
<i>Don't look down down. Down down.</i>

21:57.712 --> 21:59.782
<i>Don't look down,
don't look down.</i>

21:59.783 --> 22:02.423
<i>Down down down.</i>

22:17.893 --> 22:19.737
You guys were great!

22:19.738 --> 22:25.109
I'm so proud of you Ally. You did it!
You really did it.

22:25.110 --> 22:27.445
I'm proud of you too.

22:27.446 --> 22:30.499
Hey, now you can perform
with Austin all the time.

22:30.500 --> 22:31.512
Yeah!

22:31.513 --> 22:34.093
I don't know I think I was
only able to do that because,

22:34.094 --> 22:36.273
I was pretending to
be somebody else.

22:36.274 --> 22:39.993
Well, mask or no mask. That was
you up there, and you rocked!

22:39.994 --> 22:42.754
I did didn't I?

22:43.705 --> 22:45.820
Maybe someday I could
do that as Ally Dawson.

22:45.821 --> 22:48.648
- Great job Taylor.
- Thanks.

22:48.649 --> 22:51.476
I can't believe people
think you're Taylor Swift.

22:51.477 --> 22:54.128
I can't believe people
think that's Austin.

22:54.129 --> 22:56.769
Okay, one more.
