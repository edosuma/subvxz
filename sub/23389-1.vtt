00:01.087 --> 00:02.864
<i>Previously on "The Path"...</i>

00:02.865 --> 00:05.175
- Any sign of Eddie?
- His house is full

00:05.176 --> 00:07.068
- of deniers.
- What are they doing there?

00:07.069 --> 00:08.780
They want to reform the movement.

00:08.781 --> 00:12.173
Is it true, what they're
all saying about you?

00:12.174 --> 00:14.219
Steve asked me to guide the movement.

00:14.220 --> 00:16.683
I'm climbing the rungs
with Richard and Felicia,

00:16.684 --> 00:19.437
and when I am ready, I
am going to replace Cal.

00:19.438 --> 00:21.208
Eddie, I've done things.

00:21.209 --> 00:23.234
I've been with someone else.

00:23.235 --> 00:26.742
Go home and deal with it.

00:26.743 --> 00:29.372
Our daughter... I want to see her.

00:29.373 --> 00:31.376
You have your own son now.

00:31.377 --> 00:35.963
We have a son, and you should
let him and everyone know.

00:35.964 --> 00:37.475
Forest.

00:38.016 --> 00:39.023
Forest Roberts.

00:40.436 --> 00:44.569
- Richard, what are you doing?
- Sarah, run!

00:44.570 --> 00:47.700
Sarah blackmailed the people
who came to her for help.

00:47.701 --> 00:50.456
It was my crime, and if
I wanted to pay for it,

00:50.457 --> 00:51.708
I should have been able to.

00:51.709 --> 00:52.947
If you want to be punished,

00:52.948 --> 00:54.756
you don't have to out searching for it.

00:54.757 --> 00:56.951
Your life will be hell.

01:42.728 --> 01:45.316
No, I-I'm not coming.

01:45.317 --> 01:47.027
I don't want to be a
part of the discussion

01:47.028 --> 01:48.572
about future leadership.

01:48.573 --> 01:50.451
Look, Cal and Eddie can hash it out.

01:51.996 --> 01:53.582
Hold on, someone's at the door.

01:53.583 --> 01:56.003
Who is it?

01:56.004 --> 01:58.926
Felicia, I'm gonna
have to call you back.

02:03.895 --> 02:06.065
- Remember me?
- No.

02:06.066 --> 02:07.610
I'm one of the people you blackmailed.

02:07.611 --> 02:09.698
I lost everything! I tried to kill you.

02:09.699 --> 02:10.824
I tried to run you off the road,

02:10.826 --> 02:12.035
but that wouldn't help.

02:12.036 --> 02:15.041
I wish I could make amends, believe me.

02:15.042 --> 02:16.962
Know that I live with what I did to you.

02:19.677 --> 02:21.304
No. Please.

02:21.305 --> 02:23.016
Live with this.

02:34.373 --> 02:37.245
I know that there is confusion.

02:38.846 --> 02:42.764
I know there's fear and sadness.

02:42.765 --> 02:46.813
But Steve, he asked me to return...

02:46.814 --> 02:48.859
to serve...

02:48.860 --> 02:53.119
to bring hope to a broken movement.

02:54.539 --> 02:59.046
I tried to silence the call,
but it was just too...

03:03.055 --> 03:04.601
Earthquake!

03:38.334 --> 03:41.297
We have to go.

03:41.298 --> 03:43.301
We have to go!

03:43.302 --> 03:44.554
Everybody out!

03:44.555 --> 03:46.223
No, no, no, it's safer here.

03:46.224 --> 03:47.602
No, we have to get out!

03:47.603 --> 03:48.854
Get out of the building!

03:48.855 --> 03:50.649
Everybody out!

03:53.238 --> 03:54.491
Get out!

03:59.418 --> 04:01.086
Anybody else in there?

04:04.260 --> 04:06.098
Hey. We have to go.

04:07.309 --> 04:09.854
We have to go.

04:15.367 --> 04:17.827
- What are we running for?
- I don't know.

04:17.829 --> 04:19.248
- We have to go.
- No, I can't.

04:19.249 --> 04:20.961
It's okay. We have to...

04:23.467 --> 04:25.051
- Dad! Dad!
- No, don't...

04:25.052 --> 04:28.015
Come on! Come on. Come on.

04:28.016 --> 04:29.353
Come on.

06:10.221 --> 06:11.890
What authorities are calling

06:11.891 --> 06:14.395
a freak earthquake caused
a gas-line explosion

06:14.396 --> 06:16.148
at the New York Meyerism Center.

06:16.149 --> 06:17.526
The group's leader, Eddie Lane,

06:17.527 --> 06:19.322
emerged from the flames unharmed.

06:19.323 --> 06:22.453
Meyerist miracle or hoax?

06:39.279 --> 06:42.493
It begins.

_

07:44.034 --> 07:46.414
Hello?

07:48.668 --> 07:52.131
- Hello.
- Vera Stephens.

07:52.132 --> 07:53.885
I'm here about the position.

07:53.886 --> 07:57.393
Oh, uh... what position?

07:57.394 --> 08:00.231
The one I wrote to you about.

08:00.232 --> 08:01.943
Oh, right. Vera.

08:01.944 --> 08:05.575
You are the... the publicist, right?

08:05.576 --> 08:09.458
Oxford educated... you
worked for Greenpeace...

08:09.459 --> 08:11.128
and Breitbart.

08:11.129 --> 08:13.883
I think they both needed a facelift.

08:13.884 --> 08:16.764
Yeah, no, they, uh...

08:16.765 --> 08:18.352
they look great.

08:19.522 --> 08:23.152
Is there somewhere we
can maybe sit down?

08:23.153 --> 08:24.864
Uh, actually, no, there's not a chair

08:24.865 --> 08:28.621
in the building... just
a big, empty space.

08:28.622 --> 08:30.961
The new New York City Meyerist Center.

08:32.840 --> 08:35.894
Yeah, um, I hope so.

08:37.097 --> 08:39.434
You know, the truth is
a lot of publicists

08:39.436 --> 08:41.981
have thrown their...
their hats in the ring,

08:41.982 --> 08:45.655
and if I felt like I needed one,

08:45.656 --> 08:48.328
you'd be the first person
I would call, truly.

08:48.329 --> 08:49.872
But I just don't think I need one.

08:49.873 --> 08:52.126
I don't want to be your publicist.

08:52.127 --> 08:54.297
But I do think you're gonna need someone

08:54.298 --> 08:56.469
to help you manage the influx of money,

08:56.470 --> 08:58.598
members, and all the general mess

08:58.599 --> 09:01.729
that has arisen now that
you've trended on YouTube...

09:01.730 --> 09:03.358
And become...

09:03.359 --> 09:06.739
- A religious figure/legend.
- Right.

09:06.740 --> 09:08.410
And not to mention handle the media.

09:08.411 --> 09:10.204
I'm sure you've already been inundated

09:10.205 --> 09:11.999
with offers for interviews...

09:12.000 --> 09:14.087
not sure which one to take?

09:14.088 --> 09:17.651
Yeah, "Spirituality Today"
offered me their cover.

09:17.652 --> 09:18.721
Don't take it.

09:18.722 --> 09:20.434
They got readership all over the world.

09:20.435 --> 09:23.356
Only premium, mainstream publications.

09:23.357 --> 09:26.696
I see you on the cover of "The
Sunday Times Magazine"...

09:26.697 --> 09:28.616
"The New Face of Faith"

09:28.617 --> 09:30.360
or something like that, you know?

09:30.361 --> 09:33.292
No fringe. Nothing that puts
you over there with them.

09:33.293 --> 09:35.672
This is about where Meyerism is going,

09:35.673 --> 09:38.218
not where it has been.

09:49.910 --> 09:52.664
First of all, I, uh... I
just want to say thank you

09:52.665 --> 09:55.085
for coming out to...

09:55.086 --> 09:59.386
to celebrate our new
home in New York City.

09:59.387 --> 10:03.143
You know, we've grown a lot
over the past six months,

10:03.144 --> 10:07.276
but the work has just begun.

10:07.277 --> 10:09.823
These are tough times.

10:09.824 --> 10:13.205
Our towns are being ravaged
by substance abuse.

10:13.206 --> 10:17.714
Hate groups are springing
up in our neighborhoods.

10:17.715 --> 10:20.804
We are living within a
politically divided nation

10:20.805 --> 10:22.933
where marginalized groups are feeling

10:22.934 --> 10:26.053
more and more marginalized.

10:27.402 --> 10:30.574
But you are welcome here.

10:35.042 --> 10:38.423
See, I... I've been to The Garden.

10:38.424 --> 10:43.349
I've seen that it's not
just for a chosen few...

10:43.350 --> 10:45.812
but for everyone...

10:45.813 --> 10:49.277
anyone who walks this path.

10:49.278 --> 10:51.407
And that is why I have decided

10:51.408 --> 10:55.550
to take down the guard booth

10:56.209 --> 10:59.632
and leave the gates to The Garden open

10:59.633 --> 11:03.138
so that anyone can enter as they please.

11:08.066 --> 11:10.152
He's gonna get us all killed.

11:14.913 --> 11:17.501
I mean, it seems crazy
to remove security

11:17.502 --> 11:20.700
in times like these, but I'm...
I'm not gonna say anything.

11:21.427 --> 11:23.303
You should. You should say something.

11:23.304 --> 11:25.140
You're the one that's being realistic.

11:25.141 --> 11:27.019
No, I've completely extricated myself

11:27.020 --> 11:29.818
from making any of those
kinds of decisions.

11:32.281 --> 11:34.326
Maybe you should go see a therapist...

11:34.327 --> 11:36.747
a real one, not a Meyerist.

11:36.748 --> 11:38.418
Look, obviously, I'm just getting

11:38.419 --> 11:39.878
to know you again, but you just seem

11:39.879 --> 11:41.590
like you're suffering.

11:41.591 --> 11:43.344
And what that man did
to you in your house...

11:43.345 --> 11:47.395
What I did to that man was horrible.

11:47.396 --> 11:49.230
Right, and that's what therapy is for.

11:49.231 --> 11:51.150
Do you think I'd be able to
sit with you here right now

11:51.151 --> 11:52.695
if I hadn't been talking
to a professional

11:52.696 --> 11:54.365
three times a week?

11:54.366 --> 11:56.453
I'm doing extra sessions
just so I can make it

11:56.454 --> 11:58.915
to the big dinner on Friday.

11:58.916 --> 12:00.671
I'm really sorry.

12:04.429 --> 12:06.640
- I mean, it's been hard.
- I know.

12:06.641 --> 12:10.146
With all the changes
that Eddie has made...

12:10.147 --> 12:11.983
and is making, but...

12:14.823 --> 12:17.828
Talking to you has been
one of the better things

12:17.829 --> 12:19.332
to come of it.

12:26.138 --> 12:28.975
How is Cal doing with all these changes?

12:28.976 --> 12:32.650
No one's heard from him
since the explosions.

12:46.345 --> 12:48.598
I know. Change sucks.

12:48.599 --> 12:50.184
I know you're thinking,

12:50.185 --> 12:52.775
"How the hell am I gonna
reinvent myself?"

12:54.464 --> 12:55.550
What's your name?

12:56.574 --> 12:58.075
Barry.

12:58.076 --> 13:00.247
- Did y'all hear his name?
- No.

13:00.248 --> 13:01.708
No? Okay, come on.

13:01.709 --> 13:03.754
- Barry.
- Come on, come on, come on.

13:03.755 --> 13:05.466
- Barry.
- Yeah, one more time.

13:05.467 --> 13:06.968
- You can do better.
- Barry.

13:06.969 --> 13:08.597
All right, all right.

13:08.598 --> 13:10.225
- Barry what?
- Barry Klein.

13:10.226 --> 13:12.052
Barry Klein... but with conviction!

13:12.053 --> 13:14.024
"Barry Klein! This is who I am!

13:14.025 --> 13:15.402
Barry Klein."

13:15.403 --> 13:17.698
- Barry Klein.
- Yes!

13:17.699 --> 13:19.494
Barry Klein!

13:21.248 --> 13:22.792
All right, all right.

13:22.793 --> 13:26.551
Why are you here today, Barry Klein?

13:28.847 --> 13:31.309
I got fired from my
sales job last month.

13:31.310 --> 13:32.770
Mm-hmm. - And I haven't been able

13:32.771 --> 13:34.440
to get another gig.

13:34.441 --> 13:36.820
But it's not my fault.
The economy is shit.

13:36.821 --> 13:38.865
Ah. Did you hear what I heard?

13:38.866 --> 13:41.119
- I sure did.
- Right.

13:41.120 --> 13:43.568
You want to hire Barry Klein, Mary?

13:44.341 --> 13:47.097
No one wants a man who
won't take responsibility.

13:47.843 --> 13:50.041
That's your thing, isn't it, Barry?

13:50.515 --> 13:53.420
You make excuses for your failure...

13:54.504 --> 13:55.812
blame others.

13:55.813 --> 13:59.532
Economy sucks, the boss
sucks, the wife sucks,

13:59.533 --> 14:01.287
kids suck, am I right?

14:06.964 --> 14:08.216
Who else did that?

14:10.221 --> 14:12.808
Someone else in your life...

14:15.315 --> 14:16.677
Your father?

14:18.779 --> 14:20.130
How'd you know?

14:20.992 --> 14:24.832
Everything in your body told me so.

14:26.044 --> 14:29.258
You see, I used to carry

14:29.259 --> 14:32.222
my mother's alcoholism,

14:32.223 --> 14:34.836
my father's abandonment.

14:35.515 --> 14:40.316
But... I wasn't gonna
live like that anymore.

14:41.166 --> 14:44.798
It was time for me to be my own man.

14:44.799 --> 14:47.878
Do you want that for
yourself, Barry Klein?

14:47.879 --> 14:51.096
Do you want to be your own man?

14:52.312 --> 14:55.477
It's okay, Barry. Just keep letting go.

14:55.478 --> 14:59.067
You listen to Cal, and
you will stop blaming.

14:59.068 --> 15:01.654
You will take responsibility.

15:02.364 --> 15:04.699
And you know how hot that is, Barry?

15:06.124 --> 15:08.586
Everyone wants a responsible man.

15:12.303 --> 15:14.724
I want to be a responsible man.

15:14.725 --> 15:16.059
Great.

15:16.060 --> 15:18.732
Now tell ten friends what
you got from this workshop.

15:18.733 --> 15:22.781
This is your ultimate challenge, Barry.

15:22.782 --> 15:26.539
Your climb, your ladder.

15:29.546 --> 15:32.091
Reinvent yourself.

15:48.334 --> 15:51.923
We look to The Light for peace...

15:51.924 --> 15:54.512
guidance,

15:54.513 --> 15:56.682
and the swift arrival

15:56.683 --> 15:59.396
of the last three rungs.

16:03.447 --> 16:05.660
Thank you for guiding me.

16:07.079 --> 16:09.013
Thank you for guiding me.

16:12.160 --> 16:14.371
May Bill and your hearts heal.

16:14.372 --> 16:17.246
You might have to give up that hope.

16:18.018 --> 16:21.899
I spent more than 40 years with a man...

16:23.184 --> 16:25.782
A man who thought I made up the story

16:25.783 --> 16:28.580
that is my very foundation.

16:28.581 --> 16:31.669
All this time, he thinks I fell over,

16:31.670 --> 16:34.050
drugged, into a campfire.

16:36.889 --> 16:40.729
Well, it's easy for us
to believe in miracles.

16:40.730 --> 16:42.714
We've experienced them.

16:43.528 --> 16:45.530
I've seen miracles.

16:45.531 --> 16:48.745
And I've seen that it
doesn't make you immune

16:48.746 --> 16:51.014
from corruption.

16:53.339 --> 16:55.759
Well, I'm glad you're
keeping an eye on me.

17:00.269 --> 17:01.729
You need to see something.

17:06.906 --> 17:09.286
Something tried to break in last night.

17:27.240 --> 17:29.117
Yes?

17:29.118 --> 17:30.203
Hey...

17:30.204 --> 17:31.580
I am so sorry.

17:31.581 --> 17:33.614
Um, I'm looking for a Hawk Lane?

17:34.671 --> 17:35.908
That's me.

17:36.509 --> 17:38.511
That's cool.

17:38.512 --> 17:40.640
Uh, I'm Caleb Matthews.

17:40.641 --> 17:42.769
We have a 9:00, I believe.

17:42.770 --> 17:45.191
Yes. Come on in.

17:45.192 --> 17:46.902
Yeah.

17:46.903 --> 17:49.199
- Good to meet you.
- Yeah, you too.

17:49.200 --> 17:51.883
So you're Hawk Lane, huh?

17:52.867 --> 17:54.710
- Is there something...
- No.

17:54.711 --> 17:56.714
Uh, sorry. I was just expecting

17:56.715 --> 17:59.010
some bearded old hippie dude, you know?

17:59.011 --> 18:01.181
Meyerist Movement, Hawk Lane.

18:01.182 --> 18:03.561
It's kind of a...

18:03.562 --> 18:05.357
- No?
- No.

18:05.358 --> 18:07.026
All right, sorry. That
was a bad opening line.

18:07.027 --> 18:08.780
I should probably try that again.

18:08.781 --> 18:10.742
Yeah, not the best. Have a seat.

18:10.743 --> 18:12.662
Okay.

18:12.663 --> 18:15.125
Ah, um...

18:15.126 --> 18:17.964
Yeah, so, our youth
group, Musa, we're um...

18:17.965 --> 18:20.345
And what does that stand for?

18:20.346 --> 18:22.474
Oh, it kind of means, um...

18:22.475 --> 18:25.104
Someone with a distinct personality...

18:25.105 --> 18:26.315
a charmer.

18:26.316 --> 18:28.778
It says here your... father

18:28.779 --> 18:30.114
is the pastor of the biggest church

18:30.115 --> 18:32.213
- in Westchester.
- Yeah.

18:32.214 --> 18:33.955
Why apply to use our interfaith space?

18:33.956 --> 18:36.210
Why not just use your dad's church?

18:36.211 --> 18:38.881
Our interfaith space is reserved

18:38.882 --> 18:40.510
for groups in need.

18:40.511 --> 18:42.305
Well, first of all,

18:42.306 --> 18:45.603
like you said, my dad's
church is in Westchester.

18:45.604 --> 18:47.566
And I think that our youth group

18:47.567 --> 18:49.398
would have a wider reach
here in the city.

18:50.633 --> 18:52.993
You know, can I just be honest with you?

18:52.994 --> 18:56.781
We are all about honesty here.

18:58.589 --> 19:00.925
I'm looking to kind of individuate

19:00.926 --> 19:02.304
from my dad and his word...

19:02.305 --> 19:04.015
find my own word.

19:04.016 --> 19:06.228
Or... I don't know. How
can I say this better?

19:06.229 --> 19:07.814
Uh...

19:07.815 --> 19:11.212
I want our group to be able to talk...

19:12.238 --> 19:14.298
without our parents looking
over our shoulder.

19:19.887 --> 19:22.181
I've been a Meyerist for two years.

19:23.179 --> 19:24.917
You know my story?

19:25.810 --> 19:27.687
Ah, I'm afraid I don't.

19:27.688 --> 19:31.110
I was supposed to replace
the hot-water heater

19:31.111 --> 19:32.525
in my house.

19:33.768 --> 19:35.219
I told my wife I did it.

19:36.053 --> 19:37.346
But I didn't.

19:39.629 --> 19:41.584
It exploded.

19:42.476 --> 19:44.103
My son was injured.

19:45.646 --> 19:46.976
I'm sorry.

19:46.977 --> 19:48.774
Badly burned.

19:50.025 --> 19:51.735
He's had six surgeries.

19:54.325 --> 19:57.414
But the scars...

19:59.335 --> 20:02.637
I live with such self-hatred...

20:04.804 --> 20:06.557
Which is why I joined your movement.

20:08.478 --> 20:10.004
And it was working...

20:11.150 --> 20:14.065
The White Rooms, the green juice.

20:14.066 --> 20:16.050
U-under Eddie's guardianship,

20:16.051 --> 20:18.372
we strive to forgive ourselves.

20:18.373 --> 20:20.489
I don't want to forgive myself.

20:21.151 --> 20:22.797
- I'm sorry?
- I want to be punished.

20:22.798 --> 20:25.436
It's the only time I feel
peace from what I did.

20:26.390 --> 20:28.314
I need to be punished.

20:30.188 --> 20:32.192
Can you understand that?

21:21.033 --> 21:23.084
Six thou... Hey.

21:23.085 --> 21:26.800
We made $6,000 last month.
Can you believe that?

21:26.801 --> 21:28.682
Where's Forest's Sophie? Huh?

21:30.685 --> 21:33.104
I've been sending out
pamphlets everywhere,

21:33.105 --> 21:35.855
and I have some really big
leads in Jacksonville.

21:35.856 --> 21:38.824
Mary, there were only 12
people at that workshop.

21:38.825 --> 21:40.286
Well, you have to start somewhere.

21:43.210 --> 21:46.256
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

21:46.257 --> 21:49.679
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

21:53.999 --> 21:56.527
I was the leader of a movement
with thousands of people.

21:56.528 --> 21:58.703
I already started.
This is doubling back.

21:58.704 --> 22:00.363
Hey, you're gonna have the crowds again.

22:00.364 --> 22:01.995
That was your best workshop yet,

22:01.996 --> 22:04.709
and Barry Klein... he's gonna
tell everyone he knows.

22:04.710 --> 22:06.421
Oh, great. Barry Klein's friends.

22:06.422 --> 22:09.096
They need you. You... you were magic.

22:09.097 --> 22:11.582
- You saw right through him.
- You prescreened him.

22:11.583 --> 22:13.417
You told me everything about
him... about his father.

22:13.418 --> 22:14.604
There was no magic...

22:14.605 --> 22:16.608
The way you did it, it felt like magic.

22:18.947 --> 22:20.568
Hey, come on. Come on.

22:21.510 --> 22:23.455
Please? I love this song.

22:23.456 --> 22:25.668
Ah...

22:25.669 --> 22:27.616
Please?

22:28.592 --> 22:31.095
$6,000.

22:31.096 --> 22:33.726
- $6,000!
- Uh-huh.

22:33.727 --> 22:36.315
You're gonna be playing stadiums, baby.

22:36.316 --> 22:39.069
Okay.

22:41.074 --> 22:42.994
Oh...

22:42.995 --> 22:45.101
Hey, Small Saul. What's up?

22:45.918 --> 22:47.302
Boss needs you.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.169
Hey.

23:09.796 --> 23:12.576
I'm in a bad way I need you big-time.

23:12.577 --> 23:14.412
Uh, okay. What's going on, Harold?

23:14.413 --> 23:18.379
She's bringing the new guy
to the twins' graduation.

23:18.380 --> 23:21.761
- I don't think I can go.
- No, of course you're going.

23:21.762 --> 23:25.184
This guy's, like, some
kind of financial dude,

23:25.185 --> 23:27.564
and they'll ask questions,
like how I'm doing, and...

23:27.565 --> 23:28.900
- You'll answer them.
- And say what?

23:28.901 --> 23:30.904
- What do I say?
- The truth.

23:30.905 --> 23:33.158
You've been diagnosed with PCS.

23:33.159 --> 23:35.706
You wake up with crushing
pain in your body.

23:35.707 --> 23:37.584
Sometimes you don't know who
you are or where you are,

23:37.585 --> 23:40.131
but you're fighting...
for them, their future

23:40.132 --> 23:42.010
because you love them.

23:42.011 --> 23:45.016
And you wouldn't miss their
high-school graduation

23:45.017 --> 23:46.729
for anything in the world.

23:48.482 --> 23:49.942
Okay.

23:49.943 --> 23:51.654
Wow.

23:51.655 --> 23:54.367
"Climb Your Ladder with
Cal." That was so cool.

23:54.368 --> 23:57.624
That workshop... if I hadn't
taken that, I'd be so fucked.

23:57.625 --> 23:59.879
Well, you did take it,
and you have me now...

23:59.880 --> 24:01.716
24-hour service.

24:01.717 --> 24:04.054
Saul, book his ticket.

24:04.055 --> 24:05.682
What ticket?

24:05.683 --> 24:08.688
To Boston, for the graduation.

24:08.689 --> 24:11.161
Thanks, man. I need you on this.

24:16.079 --> 24:19.125
Here are the pills. Don't forget.

24:19.126 --> 24:22.173
Gaby, make sure Hank brings
Russel the altitude pills.

24:22.174 --> 24:24.052
Apparently he's sick as a dog.

24:24.053 --> 24:26.724
Pills. Packed. Done.

24:26.725 --> 24:30.398
- Gab, remind me.
- I'm so nervous.

24:30.399 --> 24:32.318
There's nothing to be worried about.

24:33.771 --> 24:36.744
I just wish your dad was
here... she's his sister, too,

24:36.745 --> 24:38.385
and he would have something
to say about it.

24:38.386 --> 24:40.544
Well, he would be if you
hadn't transgressed.

24:40.545 --> 24:42.673
He needs his recovery time.

24:45.220 --> 24:46.849
She's here.

24:58.455 --> 25:00.709
- Hey.
- Hi.

25:00.710 --> 25:02.044
Come on in.

25:02.045 --> 25:05.217
Mom, Dad.

25:05.218 --> 25:07.138
No husband? Where are the kids?

25:07.139 --> 25:09.350
Mom, can we just get through
tonight? Then we'll see.

25:09.351 --> 25:11.522
Healing is not gonna
happen overnight, Gab.

25:11.523 --> 25:13.066
- Come here.
- Daddy.

25:13.067 --> 25:15.114
Hi.

25:17.410 --> 25:20.540
- Hey.
- Daddy.

25:20.541 --> 25:23.337
Hi.

25:23.338 --> 25:26.092
Tessa. I love that you're here.

25:26.093 --> 25:28.263
Thanks. It's good to be here.

25:28.264 --> 25:29.934
Wine?

25:29.935 --> 25:32.146
- Yes.
- Good.

25:32.147 --> 25:35.277
Hey, uh, Uncle Eddie, did
you hear that Hawk made

25:35.278 --> 25:37.533
a decision to loan the interfaith space

25:37.534 --> 25:39.912
to a born-again mega-church group?

25:39.913 --> 25:42.208
I felt their need was sincere, so...

25:42.209 --> 25:43.920
Their beliefs couldn't be
more diametrically opposed

25:43.921 --> 25:45.069
to ours, so...

25:45.070 --> 25:48.095
Well, that's what the
interfaith space is for...

25:48.096 --> 25:50.224
to expose different
faiths to each other.

25:50.225 --> 25:52.604
Helps us keep an open mind.

25:52.605 --> 25:54.107
Speaking of open minds,

25:54.108 --> 25:56.027
how about that press conference, huh?

25:56.028 --> 25:57.656
Taking down walls

25:57.657 --> 25:59.743
when the whole world
is building them up.

25:59.744 --> 26:01.037
Sarah told me about that.

26:01.038 --> 26:02.749
I think it's a little nuts,

26:02.750 --> 26:04.587
with all the violence
against others right now.

26:04.588 --> 26:06.339
And you guys are others.

26:06.340 --> 26:07.884
What's that supposed to mean?

26:07.885 --> 26:09.429
Well, it just means you're a cult,

26:09.430 --> 26:11.141
and people still think of you as a cult.

26:11.142 --> 26:13.061
Okay, I really resent that.

26:13.062 --> 26:16.151
- Not now.
- Tessa, we are not a cult.

26:16.152 --> 26:17.912
And people are gonna
stop seeing us that way.

26:17.913 --> 26:20.619
Okay, then, why don't we
put the food on the table?

26:20.620 --> 26:22.958
- Yeah, that's a good idea.
- All right.

26:32.894 --> 26:35.065
- You all right?
- Great.

26:36.736 --> 26:39.030
That's a nice shirt.

26:39.031 --> 26:40.867
Vera pick it out for you?

26:40.868 --> 26:43.246
Look, we just work
together. That is all.

26:43.247 --> 26:46.629
Anyway, let's not get
into that right now.

26:46.630 --> 26:47.901
Here's something interesting.

26:47.902 --> 26:52.516
I had a Meyerist today that,
uh, really got to me.

26:52.517 --> 26:54.866
He wants to be punished.

26:56.191 --> 26:59.112
But now that you've gotten
rid of all the White Rooms,

26:59.113 --> 27:01.199
how do we help people who are
really struggling with that?

27:01.200 --> 27:02.661
It's easy to be punished.

27:02.662 --> 27:05.060
It's harder to forgive yourself.

27:06.002 --> 27:07.254
Maybe.

27:08.005 --> 27:11.010
But I was reading Steve's
early writings on penance,

27:11.011 --> 27:14.350
and it seems that before
he came to realignment,

27:14.351 --> 27:16.430
he was experimenting with...

27:17.358 --> 27:19.237
more severe forms.

27:20.949 --> 27:22.492
The HC.

27:22.493 --> 27:24.412
Do you know what that is?

27:24.413 --> 27:28.125
Are you sure you're asking
for someone else...

27:29.550 --> 27:31.028
and not for yourself?

27:32.806 --> 27:35.184
Why don't you put the
eggplant on the table?

27:35.185 --> 27:38.064
Hey. Sarah, you can talk to me.

27:38.065 --> 27:39.945
Yeah.

27:43.118 --> 27:46.247
Look, before we start dinner,

27:46.248 --> 27:47.769
I think you should see...

27:49.005 --> 27:50.397
this.

27:51.259 --> 27:54.138
Vera is going to slap him
with a cease and desist.

27:54.139 --> 27:56.778
He can't use Meyerism like this.

27:57.354 --> 28:00.365
Well, I mean, you said The
Light is for everyone.

28:00.820 --> 28:01.982
This isn't The Light.

28:01.983 --> 28:04.325
This is Cal exploiting the message

28:04.326 --> 28:05.828
for his own personal gain.

28:05.829 --> 28:07.773
Anyways, I just thought that you...

28:08.628 --> 28:10.624
should know, in case he...

28:10.625 --> 28:12.335
In case we're still talking?

28:12.927 --> 28:14.555
Because we're not.

28:14.556 --> 28:17.102
Won't you join us, my children?

28:20.025 --> 28:22.167
Come on, kids, it's time for dinner.

28:22.168 --> 28:25.493
Go this way, this way. Come on.

28:48.123 --> 28:49.833
I hate first shift.

28:49.834 --> 28:51.085
Stop it. At least we're outside.

28:51.086 --> 28:52.379
It's better than kitchen duty.

28:57.808 --> 28:59.353
Oh, God.

29:26.784 --> 29:29.704
No one will blame you if
you restore security.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.128
It took every ounce of resolve

29:33.129 --> 29:34.709
to embrace this calling.

29:35.300 --> 29:36.861
I am in it now.

29:37.639 --> 29:39.265
I'm doing things my way.

29:39.266 --> 29:42.229
This is about the people's safety.

29:42.230 --> 29:43.785
I know that.

29:45.529 --> 29:47.372
Give me a chance to fuck up.

29:51.234 --> 29:52.374
What are you gonna do

29:52.375 --> 29:54.714
about whatever it is that did this?

29:57.887 --> 29:59.843
I'm going to take care of it.

30:01.269 --> 30:02.762
In the meantime...

30:04.149 --> 30:06.110
prepare to restore our land

30:06.111 --> 30:08.201
for the life of these creatures.

30:15.631 --> 30:17.842
Have you seen that gray shirt
of mine that Harold likes?

30:17.843 --> 30:20.055
I washed it. It's hanging
in the bathroom.

30:20.056 --> 30:21.809
Okay.

30:21.810 --> 30:23.394
Don't be so upset. So what?

30:23.395 --> 30:25.273
You have to go to Boston
for a couple days?

30:25.274 --> 30:27.444
You don't have to manage
Harold's every mood swing.

30:27.445 --> 30:30.158
Cal, we had nothing. Now we
have free rent, free food.

30:30.159 --> 30:32.749
We can use the pool...

30:34.586 --> 30:36.212
Why don't you use the pool, Mary?

30:36.213 --> 30:38.258
I'll go help Harold call his mother

30:38.259 --> 30:39.719
or whatever he can't
do on his own today.

30:39.720 --> 30:41.473
Yes, I'm coming.

30:43.603 --> 30:45.313
- What's Harold need now?
- It's not Harold.

30:45.314 --> 30:46.823
Someone upstairs for you.

31:11.618 --> 31:13.328
Can we talk?

31:25.604 --> 31:28.066
Do you think we'll ever
be a real family again?

31:28.067 --> 31:30.696
Hey, we are a real family.

31:34.789 --> 31:36.064
What is it?

31:36.835 --> 31:38.837
Oh, it's nothing. It's just a...

31:38.838 --> 31:40.925
just a deer outside.

31:40.926 --> 31:44.808
All right. I think it's
sleepy time now, kiddo, okay?

31:44.809 --> 31:49.316
But I mean, like... you and
Mom in the same house.

31:49.317 --> 31:52.991
Okay.

31:52.992 --> 31:55.120
Hey.

31:55.121 --> 32:00.046
Me and your mom are going to love you

32:00.047 --> 32:04.639
and take care of you always, okay?

32:04.640 --> 32:07.937
But we're not gonna live together again.

32:07.938 --> 32:10.780
Plus, I have new responsibilities now.

32:10.781 --> 32:12.782
I have to be everyone's father.

32:14.034 --> 32:15.494
Why?

32:15.495 --> 32:17.372
That's just the way it is, kiddo.

32:17.373 --> 32:18.584
I don't have a choice.

32:18.585 --> 32:21.172
But... what if...

32:21.173 --> 32:23.535
you were just my dad again?

32:24.764 --> 32:26.641
How about I promise you

32:26.642 --> 32:30.066
that I will always love you most of all?

32:31.485 --> 32:33.489
Okay.

32:33.490 --> 32:35.659
Okay.

32:35.660 --> 32:37.955
Our secret. All right?

32:37.956 --> 32:40.920
Mwah.

32:42.173 --> 32:44.052
Good night.

33:16.158 --> 33:17.697
Ah, shit.

33:17.698 --> 33:19.873
- God, Eddie!
- Sorry.

33:19.874 --> 33:21.920
I'm sorry.

33:25.970 --> 33:27.304
So I guess, then,

33:27.305 --> 33:29.141
the dead rabbits got to you, too.

33:31.814 --> 33:33.942
You know what? We can reinstate security

33:33.943 --> 33:35.325
and not say a thing about it.

33:35.326 --> 33:37.950
No, I just gave my word

33:37.951 --> 33:40.081
at a press conference. I'm not gonna...

33:40.082 --> 33:41.885
Like that matters.

33:44.339 --> 33:47.511
Look, security is for cults.

33:47.512 --> 33:49.474
Oh, come on, you think mosques

33:49.475 --> 33:51.393
and synagogues aren't
adding cameras and guards?

33:51.394 --> 33:56.111
We... Don't let the past
make you unrealistic, Eddie.

33:56.112 --> 33:58.366
We can spin this however we need.

33:58.367 --> 34:01.581
Well, I don't spin things.

34:01.582 --> 34:02.960
I do.

34:06.424 --> 34:09.931
Look, every time I have to speak, I...

34:09.931 --> 34:13.235
I pray for the words to come, okay?

34:13.237 --> 34:18.030
And this time they came, and they said,

34:18.031 --> 34:20.078
"Open up the gates."

34:24.210 --> 34:26.589
You think I'm nuts, don't you?

34:26.590 --> 34:28.510
- No, I didn't say...
- No, no, no.

34:28.511 --> 34:30.556
Yeah, no... it's all right.

34:30.556 --> 34:32.089
You're not the only one.

34:33.312 --> 34:36.802
Ah, what are you? I
forget... what, an atheist?

34:37.696 --> 34:38.844
Adjacent.

34:38.846 --> 34:41.452
So you think all of
this is just nonsense?

34:41.453 --> 34:43.581
I didn't say that.

34:46.630 --> 34:49.217
Look...

34:49.217 --> 34:51.263
- I believe in you...
- Mm.

34:51.264 --> 34:55.438
Even if I do not know what
to make of The Light.

34:55.438 --> 34:57.568
And it's really fulfilling

34:57.569 --> 35:00.241
to finally sell something I believe in.

35:02.328 --> 35:04.122
Well, you know, I'm just a vessel

35:04.123 --> 35:05.543
for The Light.

35:08.417 --> 35:10.344
You don't feel like...

35:11.138 --> 35:13.350
just a vessel for The Light.

35:16.231 --> 35:18.027
I can't.

35:22.953 --> 35:24.580
Sorry. Um...

35:24.581 --> 35:26.418
The...

35:27.671 --> 35:30.131
The real reason I stopped by...

35:31.053 --> 35:34.600
tomorrow, at the restoration,
it's a great opportunity

35:34.601 --> 35:36.311
to remind everyone that you once

35:36.312 --> 35:38.525
walked a pregnant woman through fire.

35:38.526 --> 35:42.114
And you'll do it again. You
will keep everyone safe.

35:43.244 --> 35:44.329
Okay.

36:09.170 --> 36:11.105
What brings you to Florida?

36:11.797 --> 36:14.931
Eddie's gonna slap you
with a cease and desist.

36:14.932 --> 36:17.574
Copyright infringement. I
thought you should know.

36:20.777 --> 36:22.488
Eddie?

36:22.489 --> 36:24.835
It's not coming from
him. He hired an SL.

36:25.954 --> 36:28.917
"Secular liaison." That's
how he explains it.

36:28.918 --> 36:30.249
She's a publicist.

36:31.089 --> 36:33.300
The young people love her.

36:33.301 --> 36:35.848
She knows how to tweet... whatever.

36:35.849 --> 36:38.199
She's very attractive and influential.

36:39.189 --> 36:41.149
Are you here to make him jealous?

36:41.150 --> 36:44.782
No. I'm here to warn you
to cease and desist.

36:48.123 --> 36:49.542
Do you ever think

36:49.543 --> 36:51.670
about the horrible things we did?

36:53.133 --> 36:55.804
I'm distracted by surviving these days.

36:55.805 --> 36:58.058
Why did you leave after the explosion?

36:58.059 --> 36:59.762
Eddie wasn't gonna kick you out.

37:01.024 --> 37:03.193
- What can I get you?
- I-I'm good, thank you.

37:03.194 --> 37:04.780
Thank you.

37:09.457 --> 37:13.213
I couldn't stick around and
play second fiddle to God.

37:13.214 --> 37:15.802
That seems like a much better
life than you have now.

37:15.803 --> 37:18.475
I mean, "Climb Your Personal
Ladder with Cal Roberts"?

37:18.476 --> 37:20.991
Eddie... Eddie is real.

37:21.983 --> 37:25.572
And I'm fake, and... and... and...

37:25.573 --> 37:28.202
uh, that's very hard to live with.

37:28.203 --> 37:31.143
Maybe he just got lucky. You don't know.

37:32.045 --> 37:34.212
Unexplained things happen all the time.

37:34.967 --> 37:36.146
What, you don't believe in him?

37:37.305 --> 37:38.801
I just don't know, Cal.

37:40.687 --> 37:41.778
I wasn't there.

37:44.402 --> 37:46.113
Every morning I wake up,

37:46.114 --> 37:49.452
the first thing that
I see is Mark Fuller

37:49.453 --> 37:52.494
taking his life in my foyer...
and the last thing I see...

37:53.253 --> 37:54.964
at night before I go to sleep.

37:55.592 --> 37:58.012
Now, every Meyerist
self-forgiveness workshop

37:58.013 --> 37:59.598
in the world can't help,

37:59.599 --> 38:01.477
and you're the only person I can tell,

38:01.478 --> 38:04.232
because it all began with Silas.

38:04.233 --> 38:05.634
I don't know what I
can do to help you...

38:05.635 --> 38:07.990
I've been reading Steve's old journals

38:07.991 --> 38:09.959
from the early days, and
he writes about something

38:09.960 --> 38:12.248
he was experimenting with... The HC.

38:12.249 --> 38:14.503
He describes it as "the
most effective relief

38:14.504 --> 38:16.381
from the haunting of
a prior Transgress."

38:16.382 --> 38:18.511
Do you know anything about The HC?

38:18.512 --> 38:19.722
Mm-mm.

38:19.723 --> 38:21.851
No, I... I believe you do.

38:21.852 --> 38:25.191
You were mentioned often in
the writing from that time.

38:25.192 --> 38:26.374
No, I was just a kid.

38:26.375 --> 38:29.268
I wouldn't ask if I weren't desperate.

38:30.202 --> 38:31.780
Now, maybe we can help each other.

38:33.417 --> 38:35.127
Maybe if we're both punished,

38:35.128 --> 38:37.787
we can have a second chance at life.

38:38.970 --> 38:40.889
Yeah, I should get home.

38:40.890 --> 38:42.726
Obviously, it makes Mary uncomfortable

38:42.727 --> 38:43.997
that we're talking.

38:43.998 --> 38:45.734
Um, I'll make it clear to her that...

38:46.819 --> 38:49.239
it was about the cease and desist.

38:54.584 --> 38:57.423
Forest is my biggest concern now.

39:14.040 --> 39:15.372
I want to unburden.

39:15.961 --> 39:17.900
We want to take on your burden.

39:19.008 --> 39:21.834
I am the hopes and dreams of my parents.

39:22.849 --> 39:26.647
They have slaved, borrowed,
begged to send me

39:26.648 --> 39:28.552
to the Stern School of Business.

39:29.362 --> 39:31.156
Someday I will pay them back

39:31.157 --> 39:33.118
and send money home to all the relatives

39:33.119 --> 39:35.498
who are praying for me in Tacloban.

39:35.499 --> 39:37.669
And all my relatives will
talk about my family

39:37.670 --> 39:40.382
like they are Jesus and Mary and Joseph.

39:40.383 --> 39:43.263
I will make everyone so
proud, they could die,

39:43.264 --> 39:45.727
except that now, for the
first time in my life,

39:45.728 --> 39:48.148
I am making decisions for myself,

39:48.149 --> 39:50.361
and I am killing everyone's hope.

39:50.362 --> 39:51.671
No, Monica.

39:51.672 --> 39:54.058
We have to become our own beings.

39:54.059 --> 39:55.268
You're not killing their hope.

39:55.269 --> 39:57.291
They have no right to
pin their hopes on you.

39:57.292 --> 40:00.422
The Parental Lid keeps us
from our full potential.

40:00.423 --> 40:02.636
We have to remove the PL in order to...

40:02.637 --> 40:06.434
Hey. Yeah, I'm... I'm sorry
to interrupt you guys.

40:06.435 --> 40:09.711
I'm Caleb. Caleb Matthews.

40:11.029 --> 40:12.572
Hawk, do you have a second?

40:12.573 --> 40:14.035
Yeah.

40:15.454 --> 40:16.517
Be right back.

40:17.291 --> 40:19.837
Who's that? Is he new?

40:20.547 --> 40:21.966
Hey.

40:21.967 --> 40:24.053
Uh, yeah, I'm sorry to ask this.

40:24.054 --> 40:26.266
I realize we're extremely
lucky to be here,

40:26.267 --> 40:28.646
but we have a lot of really young people

40:28.647 --> 40:30.149
in our prayer circle,

40:30.150 --> 40:31.861
and, I don't know, the smell of pot

40:31.862 --> 40:34.992
just kind of makes them
uncomfortable, you know?

40:34.993 --> 40:36.620
I understand.

40:36.621 --> 40:38.875
But the purpose of our interfaith space

40:38.876 --> 40:42.125
is to expose different
religions to each other.

40:43.218 --> 40:44.878
So I'm guessing that's a no?

40:45.389 --> 40:46.862
And it's not pot.

40:46.863 --> 40:50.384
It's a sacred herb we use to
deepen our consciousness.

40:57.914 --> 40:59.801
Harold!

41:00.962 --> 41:02.933
I... come on, I know you're in there.

41:04.260 --> 41:07.306
I'm gonna call the police if
you don't answer the door

41:07.307 --> 41:09.018
in five...

41:10.606 --> 41:12.943
Four...

41:12.944 --> 41:14.948
three...

41:16.744 --> 41:18.746
Oh...

41:18.747 --> 41:20.875
- I can't do it.
- An hour...

41:20.876 --> 41:23.589
I left you here for an hour.

41:23.590 --> 41:26.302
- I can't see her with him.
- What about pills?

41:26.303 --> 41:28.016
Did you take them, too? Huh?

41:30.103 --> 41:32.398
Just a few to help with the anxiety.

41:32.399 --> 41:34.069
Right, yeah, the whole bottle, huh?

41:34.626 --> 41:36.615
The twins think I'm a failure.

41:36.616 --> 41:38.786
No, you think you're a failure.

41:38.787 --> 41:41.500
My hand hurts, man. I got
to take it easy today.

41:41.501 --> 41:43.253
- The doctor...
- No, I'm the...

41:43.254 --> 41:46.176
I'm the doctor, Harold.
I am the only doctor.

41:46.177 --> 41:48.764
And you are... you're gonna...
you're going into the bathroom.

41:48.765 --> 41:50.518
You're gonna stick your
finger down your throat,

41:50.519 --> 41:52.396
and then I'm gonna give
you three shots of B12

41:52.397 --> 41:54.610
in your ass, and then
we'll get in the car,

41:54.611 --> 41:56.655
and... and... and we'll go to see

41:56.656 --> 41:59.912
the twins graduate from high school.

41:59.913 --> 42:01.165
All right?

42:03.169 --> 42:05.965
Oh, um...

42:05.966 --> 42:10.725
you once led the league
with 11 interceptions.

42:12.312 --> 42:15.695
All right? Now, remember who you are.

42:17.323 --> 42:20.780
Yeah? Good, good, good!

42:20.781 --> 42:22.791
Now, get all this shit
out of your system,

42:22.792 --> 42:24.836
and I will be waiting right here.

42:24.837 --> 42:26.674
- I'll be waiting right here.
- Thank you.

42:26.675 --> 42:28.511
All right. All right, all right.

43:11.221 --> 43:12.807
Cal.

43:12.808 --> 43:15.437
Hey, I'm in Boston for work.

43:15.438 --> 43:16.565
Are you okay?

43:20.073 --> 43:22.498
The Hypoxian Cleanse.

43:22.499 --> 43:26.042
- Yes.
- It's, um...

43:28.339 --> 43:30.050
It's remarkable.

43:50.885 --> 43:53.681
I know that there are concerns

43:53.682 --> 43:55.852
with what is in the woods.

43:55.853 --> 43:58.022
Do you think we should tighten security

43:58.023 --> 43:59.985
until the threat is gone? I think so...

43:59.986 --> 44:02.114
We are nervous, Eddie.

44:02.115 --> 44:03.701
And we have to be realistic.

44:03.702 --> 44:05.705
There is someone in our woods,

44:05.706 --> 44:07.249
and, potentially, they are armed.

44:07.250 --> 44:08.919
Yeah, you know, we can
put together teams

44:08.920 --> 44:10.255
and do a search.

44:10.256 --> 44:12.510
Let's get that.

44:12.511 --> 44:15.265
I would not be standing
here today with my son

44:15.266 --> 44:18.171
if it weren't for this man, Eddie Lane.

44:19.568 --> 44:21.528
How can you doubt him after that?

44:21.529 --> 44:24.993
You bore witness. He saved me.

44:24.994 --> 44:27.699
Walk with Eddie Lane, and
you walk with The Light.

44:29.008 --> 44:30.303
You are safe.

44:35.891 --> 44:38.646
Today we ask The Light to forgive us

44:38.647 --> 44:40.733
for the blood taken on this land.

44:40.734 --> 44:44.156
May the pain and suffering
of the dead be transcended.

44:44.157 --> 44:46.452
From many...

44:46.453 --> 44:47.956
we are one.

44:47.957 --> 44:50.132
From many, we are one.

44:51.047 --> 44:53.008
From many, we are one.

44:53.335 --> 44:55.298
From many, we are one.

44:55.299 --> 44:57.720
From many, we are one.

44:57.721 --> 45:00.211
From many, we are one.

45:00.212 --> 45:02.648
From many, we are one.

45:02.649 --> 45:05.616
From many, we are one.

45:05.617 --> 45:07.871
From many, we are one.

45:07.872 --> 45:10.141
From many, we are one.

45:10.142 --> 45:12.672
From many, we are one.

45:12.673 --> 45:15.135
From many, we are one.

45:15.136 --> 45:17.204
From many, we are one.

45:17.205 --> 45:19.368
From many, we are one.

45:19.369 --> 45:21.481
From many, we are one.

45:21.482 --> 45:24.111
From many, we are one.

45:48.620 --> 45:51.084
Thank you, guys. Thank you.

45:52.628 --> 45:53.645
Hey, Sarah.

45:54.464 --> 45:56.969
Look, I just wanted to say

45:56.970 --> 45:59.441
that I am going to take care of this.

45:59.442 --> 46:03.189
Okay? Whatever is in the
woods, I promise you.

46:03.190 --> 46:04.693
And I promise you.

46:04.694 --> 46:06.057
Okay?

46:07.157 --> 46:08.575
Be careful, Eddie.

46:08.576 --> 46:10.245
It's easy for the true Light

46:10.246 --> 46:12.500
to be obscured by the
flash of the cameras.

46:18.095 --> 46:20.306
That was amazing.

46:20.307 --> 46:21.840
I'll get that on the Website.

46:22.395 --> 46:25.191
And, uh, smart of me to
bring in Candace, huh?

46:25.192 --> 46:27.595
Don't pull shit like that ever again.

46:28.491 --> 46:31.558
And don't tape anything
without asking me first.

47:14.249 --> 47:17.045
Okay, I changed all your software.

47:17.046 --> 47:19.299
I added an extra layer of
encryption to everything.

47:19.300 --> 47:20.397
Thanks.

47:20.398 --> 47:23.109
You should be changing your
passwords every week, Vera.

47:23.894 --> 47:25.360
Are you listening to me?

47:25.361 --> 47:29.027
You don't take this seriously,
but they're watching, okay?

47:29.028 --> 47:31.365
There are people watching
and... and people who know.

47:31.366 --> 47:34.037
Not just the government, people
who are tapped into us...

47:34.038 --> 47:36.292
I hear you. I'll change my passwords.

47:36.293 --> 47:37.797
What's the matter?

47:40.134 --> 47:41.553
Nothing.

47:41.554 --> 47:43.071
Can I, um...

47:45.019 --> 47:46.633
can I make you feel better?

47:50.237 --> 47:51.704
Okay.

47:52.660 --> 47:54.704
But I'm not having dinner with you.

47:56.667 --> 47:58.044
Someday...

48:00.967 --> 48:03.014
I will break you down...

48:04.642 --> 48:08.022
And you will have dinner with me.

48:19.337 --> 48:21.131
Mmm.

48:21.132 --> 48:23.569
I'm just focused on my career right now.

48:24.472 --> 48:28.480
Steve knew our natural human instinct

48:28.481 --> 48:30.301
was toward destruction.

48:30.819 --> 48:32.453
I blackmailed people.

48:33.908 --> 48:36.291
I let Silas remain in the ground.

48:38.042 --> 48:40.128
I had relations with Cal.

49:00.210 --> 49:02.172
Don't stop.

49:14.573 --> 49:16.743
This will make Petey feel better.

49:21.087 --> 49:24.473
You bring him in next week,
and we'll see how he's doing.

49:24.474 --> 49:26.482
Is he going to die of the cancer?

49:27.766 --> 49:30.061
He'll probably outlive all of us.

49:46.386 --> 49:49.906
We have to suffocate the Transgress.

49:50.645 --> 49:54.109
I... I killed Mark Fuller.

49:54.110 --> 49:55.737
I killed Mark Fuller.

49:55.738 --> 49:57.305
That's not it, Sarah.

50:01.124 --> 50:03.044
What are you really afraid of?

50:04.506 --> 50:05.671
Richard...

50:06.343 --> 50:09.400
I know I'm responsible
for Richard's death.

50:10.017 --> 50:13.899
What future Transgress do you need...

50:13.900 --> 50:17.447
to choke from your body?

50:17.448 --> 50:19.159
The Hypoxian Cleanse only works

50:19.160 --> 50:20.913
if you say the words.

50:28.888 --> 50:30.891
Meyerism...

50:30.892 --> 50:33.605
doesn't work for me anymore.

50:36.570 --> 50:39.742
It doesn't work.

50:53.055 --> 50:54.787
Hey, Mom.

50:54.788 --> 50:57.987
Mom, got us some dinner.

52:32.761 --> 52:34.179
Hello?

52:50.420 --> 52:51.587
Hello?

52:52.884 --> 52:54.607
Hey, who's out there?

52:55.765 --> 52:57.359
Just come out.

52:58.729 --> 53:00.022
All right?

53:00.065 --> 53:02.402
Please, I'm not gonna hurt you.

53:06.320 --> 53:12.320
