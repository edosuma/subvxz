00:00.320 --> 00:02.320
<i>Being single is completely underrated.</i>

00:02.480 --> 00:04.920
<i>You can use up all the hot water</i>
<i>for long baths,</i>

00:05.080 --> 00:06.360
<i>not share the popcorn,</i>

00:06.520 --> 00:09.160
<i>and hog the remote</i>
<i>to flip through 500 channels.</i>

00:09.320 --> 00:12.560
<i>This is helpful if you have amnesia.</i>
<i>You can fill in decades of info</i>

00:12.720 --> 00:15.120
<i>in the time it takes</i>
<i>your nail polish to dry.</i>

00:15.480 --> 00:17.920
Did you know that Hitler
had a mistress? What a jerk.

00:18.080 --> 00:19.840
- History Channel again?
- Yeah.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.920
I only caught the second half,
but I think I got the gist.

00:23.080 --> 00:24.080
Look at this.

00:25.400 --> 00:27.640
- You can send coffee to the troops.
- Put it down.

00:27.800 --> 00:29.320
- Why? It's a nice thing to do.
- Yeah.

00:29.480 --> 00:33.040
I thought it was a nice thing too.
I sent a pound of Sumatra Dark, a note,

00:33.200 --> 00:36.120
and got a note back
from Captain Randy Holt saying thank you.

00:36.280 --> 00:38.640
Then I, to be polite, e-mailed back,
"You're welcome."

00:38.800 --> 00:41.160
And then he e-mailed me back,
"What's up?"

00:41.320 --> 00:42.920
Now I feel I'm cheating on Chase,

00:43.080 --> 00:45.240
and I led him on,
and I'm a coffee tease.

00:45.640 --> 00:46.640
Coffee tease.

00:47.960 --> 00:49.000
See, the whole store knows.

00:49.160 --> 00:51.760
Oh, come on. Calm down.
You are not cheating on Chase.

00:51.920 --> 00:55.720
All right? He's just a lonely soldier
who wants news from home.

00:55.880 --> 00:58.440
You know, just keep it
to, like, small talk,

00:58.600 --> 00:59.600
you know, boring stuff.

00:59.760 --> 01:00.760
You know what,

01:00.920 --> 01:04.120
why don't you tell that story you told
me three times about your fridge?

01:04.280 --> 01:05.960
- Hey.
- Which I found thrilling.

01:06.120 --> 01:10.480
But I think in his day, it would be
a nice break from all the excitement.

01:10.640 --> 01:12.680
- Hey, Andrea.
- I'm on a date.

01:12.840 --> 01:15.760
You and Tony Dane are still texting?
When are you gonna meet--?

01:16.920 --> 01:19.040
Look, I know he's a basketball star
and everything,

01:19.200 --> 01:20.520
but he should take the time to--

01:21.320 --> 01:22.760
Okay, why are you bupping me?

01:22.920 --> 01:25.720
Look, it's okay. You know,
just because I'm not dating anyone

01:26.160 --> 01:28.520
doesn't mean that you can't talk
about your relationship.

01:28.680 --> 01:31.680
That's exactly what it means.
Every time you're not dating someone

01:31.840 --> 01:34.400
and I am, you do everything you can
to try and break us up.

01:34.560 --> 01:38.200
Oh, come on, I would never do--
Oh, and of course, I'm wrong.

01:38.480 --> 01:40.480
I'm gonna go to the little girls' room.

01:40.640 --> 01:42.560
I'll be right back.

01:45.560 --> 01:48.360
You guys make a great couple. Yeah.

01:48.520 --> 01:52.200
Andrea must be really happy if she's
gonna try and go off her meds again.

01:53.800 --> 01:55.240
You work out, huh?

01:55.680 --> 01:56.680
Yeah.

01:56.840 --> 02:00.160
That'll be helpful when Andrea's husband
gets out of prison.

02:01.360 --> 02:02.800
Seriously,

02:02.960 --> 02:06.320
you don't recognise her
from her "film career"?

02:06.480 --> 02:07.840
No?

02:09.120 --> 02:12.240
All right, look, I know
that that used to happen, but I am--

02:12.400 --> 02:14.040
- Different now. We know.
- Different now.

02:14.200 --> 02:16.560
Fine, whatever. I will back off.

02:16.720 --> 02:19.160
I just thought it would be
a nice story to tell your kids

02:19.320 --> 02:21.640
that Mommy and Daddy
actually met once.

02:21.800 --> 02:22.880
We're trying to meet.

02:23.040 --> 02:26.640
We're just very high-powered people
with very busy schedules.

02:27.400 --> 02:29.960
But it seems like he's the one
who's always cancelling on you--

02:31.280 --> 02:32.280
I know.

02:40.640 --> 02:42.800
Turn on the tube.
The game starts in five minutes.

02:42.960 --> 02:44.920
What channel's it on?

02:45.160 --> 02:47.400
<i>Todd, it's Cameron.</i>
<i>I didn't hear from you.</i>

02:47.560 --> 02:50.480
<i>I just called to see</i>
<i>if you wanted to meet up sometime.</i>

02:51.920 --> 02:52.920
Cameron?

02:53.080 --> 02:55.080
The dancer with the legs
and the daddy issues.

02:55.240 --> 02:56.840
What the hell, man?

02:57.000 --> 02:58.320
I might call. I don't know.

02:58.720 --> 03:01.320
Man, I'd be all over that.
And that girl at the deli?

03:01.880 --> 03:05.000
"Take a number, here's mine."
They're like dropping from trees out there.

03:05.160 --> 03:07.080
What are you hanging around here for?

03:07.360 --> 03:09.000
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

03:09.160 --> 03:10.440
Hey.

03:13.320 --> 03:16.200
- Shut up.
- Todd, come on.

03:16.360 --> 03:18.080
What are you doing, man?

03:18.240 --> 03:21.200
We've been hanging out a lot lately.
You know, movies, dinners.

03:21.360 --> 03:23.640
Maybe it'll grow from friends
into something else.

03:23.800 --> 03:26.520
Todd, listen to me.
You are quickly becoming gay roommate.

03:26.680 --> 03:29.680
If you want it to turn into something,
you gotta make her miss you.

03:29.840 --> 03:33.560
- We live in the same apartment.
- Then get out. Be less available.

03:33.720 --> 03:35.440
All right? Sam is smart.

03:35.600 --> 03:38.120
Why buy the bull
when you can castrate it for free?

03:38.280 --> 03:39.760
Wow, that's beautiful, man.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.680
Hey. Hey, Seth.

03:41.840 --> 03:43.400
You work for Tony Dane, right?

03:43.560 --> 03:45.720
- Towel boy.
- Mock if you will, my friend,

03:45.880 --> 03:48.280
but if it weren't for me,
he'd always be wet.

03:48.440 --> 03:50.640
I don't like the way
that he is treating Andrea.

03:50.800 --> 03:54.080
I mean, why is he stringing her along?
Does he not like her or something?

03:54.240 --> 03:57.160
I mean, what, is he afraid of commitment?
Like, what's the deal?

03:57.320 --> 04:00.720
I'll ask him about his feelings
next time we get our nails done.

04:00.880 --> 04:02.440
Look, I need to talk to him, okay?

04:02.600 --> 04:04.520
- Why?
- Because I owe her.

04:04.680 --> 04:07.880
Look, I just need a way to get to him,
Sethy.

04:10.360 --> 04:12.520
- What, I just go in?
- This is what you wanted.

04:12.680 --> 04:13.960
Now, here's your press pass.

04:14.120 --> 04:16.480
If you get caught or captured,
I don't know you,

04:16.640 --> 04:19.560
because believe it or not,
it is possible for me to be demoted.

04:19.720 --> 04:20.920
Really?

04:21.080 --> 04:22.440
Okay.

04:24.280 --> 04:26.920
Good game. Good game.
Way to play. Way to play.

04:27.080 --> 04:28.520
- Hey.
- Oh, I'm sorry about that.

04:28.680 --> 04:29.960
That's a whole lot of naked.

04:30.120 --> 04:32.880
How did you give up 12 unanswered
points in the fourth quarter?

04:33.040 --> 04:34.120
We come to play every night.

04:34.280 --> 04:36.520
Anyone in this league can beat you
any night of the week,

04:36.680 --> 04:39.720
so you gotta rely on your teammates.
Any more questions?

04:40.320 --> 04:42.760
Why do you keep cancelling
on Andrea Belladonna?

04:42.920 --> 04:44.200
What paper are you with?

04:44.360 --> 04:46.600
I happen to be with...

04:48.000 --> 04:49.480
...<i>Heinie Magazine</i>.

04:49.920 --> 04:51.440
Anyway, why do you keep cancelling
on her?

04:51.600 --> 04:55.560
What, are you a commitment-phobe,
or just a big fat liar? Which is it?

04:55.720 --> 04:58.360
I'm not cancelling on her.
She's cancelling on me.

04:58.520 --> 05:00.520
Really? That's weird.

05:04.680 --> 05:06.040
Hey, Andrea.

05:06.200 --> 05:09.640
- What did you do?
- Me? Nothing. This and that.

05:09.800 --> 05:11.240
- You?
- Oh, me?

05:11.400 --> 05:13.840
Me? I got a text message
from Tony Dane.

05:14.320 --> 05:17.000
Said, "Some crazy blond
came into my locker room

05:17.160 --> 05:19.400
and accused me
of always cancelling on you."

05:20.280 --> 05:23.160
That Paris Hilton.
God, she's everywhere.

05:23.320 --> 05:26.840
You just had to get involved, didn't you?
I told you to leave it alone.

05:27.000 --> 05:29.720
You know what? You also told me
that he was cancelling on you.

05:29.880 --> 05:32.240
So you know what? You lied to me,
and that's one of the sins.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.760
- Don't even.
- Why don't you wanna see him?

05:34.920 --> 05:37.040
Because. Because it is perfect.

05:37.200 --> 05:39.920
We text each other all the time.
We share things.

05:40.080 --> 05:41.160
We never fight.

05:41.320 --> 05:44.840
It is the best relationship I have ever had,
and you just destroyed it.

05:47.200 --> 05:49.800
- Guess you managed to hear all that.
- Some.

05:49.960 --> 05:51.400
Mostly I was writing a poem.

06:01.960 --> 06:03.880
Excuse me. Excuse me.

06:04.440 --> 06:07.240
Hey. I am completely afraid
that a bug

06:07.400 --> 06:09.800
is gonna crawl
down my throat when I'm asleep.

06:09.960 --> 06:12.040
I saw that
on the Discovery Channel last night.

06:12.720 --> 06:15.320
When did you start thinking
that your life needed a narrator?

06:15.480 --> 06:17.920
Everyone is afraid of something,
all right?

06:18.080 --> 06:19.520
Go out with Tony.

06:19.800 --> 06:22.440
You need more
than a text relationship, Andrea.

06:22.600 --> 06:25.120
You deserve that, and Tony likes you.

06:25.280 --> 06:28.360
No, no. He likes the stuff
my phone says I say.

06:28.520 --> 06:29.920
Okay? I mean,

06:30.080 --> 06:32.760
I can be this perfect person,
and I plan every word,

06:32.920 --> 06:35.160
and I could spell-check myself.

06:35.520 --> 06:38.440
What if I meet him and every word
that just comes out of my mouth

06:38.600 --> 06:40.680
is just misspelled?

06:40.840 --> 06:43.480
If that's what you're worried about,
I'll go with you.

06:44.200 --> 06:47.480
I'll bring Todd. We can be like
the Ricardos and the Mertzes,

06:47.640 --> 06:50.520
the Flintstones and the Rubbles.
I've been watching way too much TV.

06:50.680 --> 06:52.200
Yes.

06:53.720 --> 06:55.480
Mr. Newly, hi. I have a situation.

06:55.640 --> 06:59.160
I've been writing to a soldier in Iraq,
and I may have mentioned in a letter

06:59.320 --> 07:00.480
that my refrigerator's broken.

07:00.640 --> 07:02.040
Today, this one showed up,

07:02.200 --> 07:06.120
and if my real boyfriend, Chase, sees it
at my place, he'll know I'm cheating.

07:07.880 --> 07:09.880
Regina, it's for you.

07:11.160 --> 07:14.560
Hey, Todd,
will you please bring me my purse?

07:20.840 --> 07:22.280
Hey. Is the man of the house at home?

07:22.440 --> 07:25.320
- I was getting this for Samantha.
- Yeah, that's better.

07:26.680 --> 07:29.720
Before I forget, we are going out
with Andrea tomorrow night, okay?

07:29.880 --> 07:31.240
Hey, Seth.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.560
No.

07:36.040 --> 07:37.480
- No?
- No.

07:37.640 --> 07:39.040
Not available.

07:39.200 --> 07:40.560
Not even gonna say why.

07:40.880 --> 07:42.280
Okay, well,

07:42.440 --> 07:45.200
I just thought you might wanna
hang out with Tony Dane,

07:45.360 --> 07:47.440
but I guess I was wrong.

07:56.600 --> 07:58.760
- Okay! Okay!
- Eight o'clock.

07:58.920 --> 08:01.960
This is you playing hard to get?
So far I've only seen "get."

08:02.120 --> 08:03.560
I'm hanging out with Tony Dane.

08:03.720 --> 08:06.040
I can still ignore Sam.
In fact, she can see me ignore her.

08:06.200 --> 08:07.560
It'll drive her nuts. Up high.

08:07.720 --> 08:10.240
- Gay roommate.
- Shut it.

08:12.040 --> 08:13.440
This is in Farsi.

08:13.600 --> 08:15.400
I should've stopped
writing Captain Randy.

08:15.560 --> 08:16.720
Sam said it was okay,

08:16.880 --> 08:19.640
but now the poor guy
is sending me major appliances.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.560
I mean, I have to get out of this.

08:21.720 --> 08:24.640
It's tearing me apart.
I can't keep living two lives.

08:24.800 --> 08:27.320
Honey, I don't think you're living one.

08:27.800 --> 08:29.360
You gotta break up with this guy.

08:29.520 --> 08:33.160
I can't break up with a soldier. I have
a "Support the Troops" sticker on my car.

08:33.320 --> 08:34.480
Then let me do it, please.

08:34.640 --> 08:37.480
I haven't broken up with anyone
for so long, it'll make me feel a teenager.

08:37.880 --> 08:39.480
No, it's my responsibility.

08:39.640 --> 08:42.440
I'm just gonna go and do it now.

08:42.840 --> 08:45.000
Fine, leave, but don't come back.

08:46.320 --> 08:47.320
Excuse me?

08:47.480 --> 08:48.760
No.

08:49.280 --> 08:50.800
Please. Don't--

08:50.960 --> 08:53.640
Don't make this
any harder than it needs to be.

08:54.120 --> 08:57.880
We had our chance,
but our chance came and went.

08:58.040 --> 08:59.440
People change.

08:59.600 --> 09:01.240
So just--

09:01.560 --> 09:03.320
Just walk away,

09:03.720 --> 09:06.440
and always remember
the times that we had.

09:13.880 --> 09:16.000
You are so hired.

09:20.720 --> 09:23.080
Hello? Thirsty.

09:23.240 --> 09:24.280
My drink?

09:24.440 --> 09:26.400
You know, I forgot you were there.

09:26.560 --> 09:28.760
You know what? I should go.

09:28.920 --> 09:31.200
Yeah, I have a big tort complaint
to prepare for,

09:31.360 --> 09:33.840
and you don't know what that is,
so you can't say I'm lying.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.640
- Here he comes.
- Yeah.

09:35.800 --> 09:38.680
- Hey, Tony!
- See, he hates me.

09:38.840 --> 09:41.440
He doesn't. Now just breathe, okay?

09:44.040 --> 09:45.480
Andrea?

09:46.160 --> 09:47.720
It was definitely worth the wait.

09:48.840 --> 09:50.560
Hi-lo.

09:50.720 --> 09:54.040
I meant to say hi,
and then I thought hello,

09:54.200 --> 09:56.560
and it came out like hi-lo.

09:58.120 --> 09:59.240
Let me start again.

10:00.520 --> 10:01.520
Hi-lo.

10:04.120 --> 10:06.480
Now, Philly,
that's a tough town to play in.

10:07.840 --> 10:09.160
Are you two together, or what?

10:10.040 --> 10:11.920
- No, I'm alone. Lone wolf.
- Used to be.

10:12.080 --> 10:13.480
I don't even know her.

10:16.040 --> 10:17.320
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

10:17.480 --> 10:19.000
Yeah.

10:21.160 --> 10:22.680
Excuse me.

10:42.640 --> 10:43.920
- Gay?
- Trust me.

10:44.080 --> 10:46.520
Yeah, well, he wasn't before he went.

10:46.680 --> 10:49.400
He took the urinal right next to me,
and then there was a look.

10:49.840 --> 10:52.040
- How does that make him gay?
- There was a nod.

10:52.200 --> 10:53.880
Okay, a look and a nod, that's it?

10:54.040 --> 10:55.880
And a smile.
There was a look, a nod and a smile.

10:56.040 --> 10:58.600
- Only thing missing was ice skates.
- Ice skates?

10:58.760 --> 11:00.240
Figure skaters are gay, right?

11:00.400 --> 11:02.120
I don't know. This is not my scene.

11:02.280 --> 11:04.040
Sam. Sam. Come here.

11:04.480 --> 11:06.680
Do not say anything, all right?
This is going really well,

11:06.840 --> 11:10.120
and I'm not gonna let anything screw it up.
Okay?

11:11.400 --> 11:13.320
- Yeah?
- Tony said the most amazing thing.

11:13.480 --> 11:15.800
- Go ahead. Say it again.
- I just said I liked her shoes.

11:15.960 --> 11:17.360
No. No. No.

11:17.520 --> 11:19.840
He said he liked
my vintage Lacroix shoes.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.600
I mean, really, what kind of man
notices something like that?

11:22.760 --> 11:25.000
Sam, thoughts?

11:31.120 --> 11:33.800
I mean, look at her. She likes him.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.880
Maybe she can change him.
It's possible.

11:36.040 --> 11:38.400
They have camps for that.
I saw it on the Bible channel.

11:38.560 --> 11:40.040
- Just tell her.
- Tell her what?

11:40.200 --> 11:42.600
That she's in love with a gay man?
I can't tell her that.

11:42.760 --> 11:45.160
She's just gonna think
that I'm sabotaging her relationship.

11:45.320 --> 11:47.320
- So don't tell her.
- She's in love with a gay man.

11:47.480 --> 11:49.800
How can I not tell her?
She's gonna get hurt.

11:49.960 --> 11:52.200
Wait a minute, you're right. You're right.

11:52.360 --> 11:53.960
I don't tell her. I show her.

11:54.120 --> 11:56.960
If she sees it for herself
then she can't be mad at me, right?

11:57.120 --> 11:59.080
Thank you so much.
You're such a good friend.

11:59.240 --> 12:02.080
Wait, friend?
No, no, no. I'm not your--

12:03.240 --> 12:04.240
Damn it.

12:07.600 --> 12:08.600
Like it?

12:08.760 --> 12:12.360
Hey, look at me, I'm a break-up artist.
Nice stove.

12:12.520 --> 12:14.040
I'm sorry.

12:14.200 --> 12:17.280
He told me how hard it was for him there,
and I wanted to relate,

12:17.440 --> 12:19.560
so I told him the light on my stove
kept going out.

12:19.720 --> 12:21.840
You were supposed to be
helping me out of this.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.400
I couldn't do it. He needs me.

12:23.560 --> 12:26.040
I might be the only thing
keeping him alive at night.

12:26.200 --> 12:28.720
- Who are you keeping alive at night?
- My soldier.

12:28.880 --> 12:30.240
Oh, I'll break up with him.

12:30.400 --> 12:34.560
I fire people all the time, no problem,
but nobody buys my wife a stove.

12:34.720 --> 12:37.640
- Including you.
- Damn right.

12:38.600 --> 12:39.720
Look at it.

12:39.880 --> 12:41.640
You begged for it. Look at it.

12:41.800 --> 12:45.440
Tony, you know, Todd and I were
talking this morning

12:45.600 --> 12:48.040
about what our favourite characters
on <i>Sex and the City</i> were,

12:48.200 --> 12:51.160
and I was just curious what yours was.

12:51.320 --> 12:54.040
You know,
I've never seen <i>Sex and the City</i>.

12:55.480 --> 12:56.840
It's okay.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.920
Let's put on some music, all right?

12:59.080 --> 13:01.680
Tony, you can pick,
because you're the guest.

13:02.560 --> 13:06.440
We have Foo Fighters, Metallica,

13:06.680 --> 13:08.240
<i>Mamma Mia.</i>

13:09.360 --> 13:11.400
Hey, what's your favourite musical,
Tony?

13:11.720 --> 13:13.800
I'm really not into musicals.

13:13.960 --> 13:16.680
Oh, really, so you're gonna play it
that way, huh?

13:16.840 --> 13:19.720
Andrea, I need to get some more wine.
Will you help me open up a bottle?

13:19.880 --> 13:21.560
Okay, good.

13:22.040 --> 13:23.640
Guys, have fun.

13:26.280 --> 13:27.640
I like him.

13:27.800 --> 13:31.800
- Oh, me too. You know, I think we--
- I think you should have sex with him.

13:31.960 --> 13:34.200
- What?
- Yeah. Right now. Just try,

13:34.360 --> 13:36.440
and then observe
what happens, you know?

13:36.600 --> 13:38.080
If he says that he's not in the mood,

13:38.240 --> 13:41.480
then you tell him to get in the mood
or explain why not. Okay?

13:41.640 --> 13:42.960
That sounds kind of hot.

13:43.120 --> 13:44.520
Yeah, it is kind of.

13:44.680 --> 13:46.880
But I like him, I really do.

13:47.040 --> 13:50.120
I think I kind of wanna take it slow
with him.

13:50.280 --> 13:51.720
Oh, my God.

13:51.880 --> 13:54.520
Maybe some of the new you
is rubbing off on me.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.000
Now?

13:59.640 --> 14:01.920
Oh, God.

14:02.160 --> 14:05.320
What are you doing leaving me out there?
I'm a pleaser, you know that?

14:05.480 --> 14:08.200
Look, Andrea's just not getting it.

14:08.680 --> 14:10.760
- I need you to sleep with Tony Dane.
- Sorry?

14:10.920 --> 14:12.200
We already know he likes you,

14:12.360 --> 14:14.680
so we just need him to, like,
hit on you in front of her.

14:15.160 --> 14:18.040
I know what we could do. We could
go out there, we could all start dancing.

14:18.200 --> 14:20.560
Then I'll switch,
you can start dancing with Tony--

14:20.720 --> 14:24.120
- Wait, wait. No, no, no.
- We'll switch-- Start dancing with him.

14:24.280 --> 14:27.000
- Let's just open this up a little bit.
- Will you just cut it out?

14:27.160 --> 14:30.440
- Put some oil on. It needs to shimmer.
- Stop it. What are you doing?

14:30.600 --> 14:33.480
I'm not your toy. I'm not your pal.
I'm not your girlfriend,

14:33.640 --> 14:35.120
and I'm not your gay roommate.

14:35.280 --> 14:37.400
I'm here, okay? Right here.

14:37.560 --> 14:39.120
And I guess that's the problem.

14:47.520 --> 14:48.760
Drama queen, huh?

14:48.920 --> 14:50.440
Snap!

14:51.360 --> 14:52.760
- Where's Andrea?
- Bathroom.

14:52.920 --> 14:54.320
Oh, good.

14:54.480 --> 14:56.480
Then it's just the two of us.

14:56.640 --> 14:58.440
All right, Tony,
you can be straight with me.

14:58.600 --> 15:02.160
- I'm sorry, that's a poor choice of words.
- What are you talking about?

15:02.320 --> 15:04.240
- I think you know.
- Do I?

15:04.760 --> 15:08.120
Tony, I know what happened
in the men's room with Todd, okay?

15:08.280 --> 15:10.040
And Andrea is my best friend,

15:10.200 --> 15:12.240
and I'm not gonna stand by
and let her get hurt.

15:12.400 --> 15:14.200
Look, she's gonna understand.

15:14.360 --> 15:16.520
I mean, I have admitted
so many horrible things to her,

15:16.680 --> 15:17.800
and she's always forgiven me.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.560
Not that being gay is horrible,

15:19.720 --> 15:22.960
or needs to be forgiven or anything.
I think it's good. It's--

15:23.120 --> 15:25.640
Go, gays! So...

15:27.720 --> 15:29.040
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:29.200 --> 15:31.000
What's going on?

15:31.960 --> 15:33.520
Andrea,

15:34.640 --> 15:36.240
this isn't easy to say.

15:36.680 --> 15:38.800
It's okay. It's okay, Tony.
It's all right.

15:38.960 --> 15:40.200
Andrea,

15:40.360 --> 15:42.440
Tony has something
that he needs to tell you.

15:43.040 --> 15:44.560
- Sam tried to hit on me.
- What?

15:44.760 --> 15:47.240
- Sam.
- No. No, what?

15:47.400 --> 15:50.440
I don't wanna come between the two
of you, but I think we should just go.

15:50.600 --> 15:53.440
I was not hitting on him.
I was not hitting on you.

15:53.600 --> 15:57.000
I was-- Why would I hit on him?
He's gay.

15:57.160 --> 15:59.560
Yeah, you're gay. He's gay.

15:59.720 --> 16:02.040
There. God, I said it. I said it.

16:02.200 --> 16:03.800
Big weight lifted now.

16:03.960 --> 16:06.920
Oh, honey, he is gay.

16:07.080 --> 16:09.160
Oh, my God.

16:09.320 --> 16:10.920
Honestly, Sam.

16:11.080 --> 16:13.000
A new low, even for you.

16:13.160 --> 16:14.760
What? No.

16:14.920 --> 16:16.360
He's gay--

16:16.520 --> 16:18.800
He was staring at Todd's:

16:19.840 --> 16:22.960
Maybe Andrea's right. Maybe I do
have some sort of pathological need

16:23.120 --> 16:25.000
to destroy all of her relationships.

16:25.160 --> 16:27.480
It's like, I don't know
if Tony Dane is gay.

16:27.640 --> 16:30.200
- I could be totally wrong.
- My boyfriend in college was gay.

16:30.360 --> 16:32.200
We didn't know it at the time.
I mean, he knew it,

16:32.360 --> 16:34.720
and all of the members
of the Man Alive Choir,

16:34.880 --> 16:36.880
but I did not see it.

16:37.240 --> 16:39.880
Now Andrea hasn't called me back
for two days. Todd's avoiding me.

16:40.040 --> 16:41.240
He leaves before I even get up.

16:41.400 --> 16:42.880
Did you do something
to make him mad,

16:43.040 --> 16:46.040
like ask him to oil up
and seduce Tony Dane?

16:46.760 --> 16:48.040
No. Just that.

16:50.640 --> 16:51.960
Hi.

16:52.120 --> 16:54.320
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

16:54.480 --> 16:56.280
- Guess who's gay?
- No one.

16:56.440 --> 16:59.480
No one's gay, and anyone who says
that they are are just kidding themselves.

17:01.520 --> 17:02.760
Tony Dane.

17:02.920 --> 17:05.480
Maybe not.
Maybe I'm just being narrow-minded.

17:05.920 --> 17:07.320
You know what? In Europe,

17:07.480 --> 17:10.760
straight guys, they hold hands,
they walk right on down the street.

17:10.920 --> 17:12.720
No, he's gay. He told me himself.

17:12.880 --> 17:14.280
He did?

17:14.440 --> 17:16.920
You know that I was not
trying to break you guys up.

17:17.080 --> 17:21.560
Yes, and today,
we're leaking our relationship to the press.

17:21.720 --> 17:23.240
Okay, I know I'm the one with amnesia,

17:23.400 --> 17:25.480
but that means when two guys
love each other and--

17:26.440 --> 17:28.040
- Yeah.
- No, look. This is all good.

17:28.200 --> 17:29.760
Tony gets to have me on his arm,

17:29.920 --> 17:33.080
and I get paparazzi, press
and private planes,

17:33.240 --> 17:35.720
and I get to see
whoever I want in secret.

17:35.880 --> 17:37.960
So you know what, Sam?
You were right.

17:38.120 --> 17:41.400
I need more out of a relationship: fame.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.080
Okay.

17:43.240 --> 17:45.240
Are you sure that this is what you want?

17:45.400 --> 17:47.120
- Yes, yes.
- Really?

17:48.440 --> 17:51.760
It's just a little weird to have a guy
who's just a friend.

17:51.920 --> 17:54.200
It doesn't have to be.
I mean, look at me and Todd.

17:54.360 --> 17:57.480
- No, it only works if one of you is gay.
- Why?

17:57.640 --> 18:01.800
There's always one that wants something
more than the other one. Usually me.

18:02.480 --> 18:03.560
Or Todd.

18:03.720 --> 18:06.320
Oh, God, I am such an idiot.
Of course he was mad

18:06.480 --> 18:09.320
I was trying to put oil on him.
Who wants to be treated like that?

18:09.480 --> 18:12.520
Chase. He loves it when I take
baby oil and:

18:14.280 --> 18:17.440
<i>I saw this thing on the Discovery Channel</i>
<i>about the theory of matter,</i>

18:17.600 --> 18:19.880
<i>that matter exists in different forms.</i>

18:20.360 --> 18:23.480
<i>I think the same thing applies to love.</i>
<i>Love is like liquid.</i>

18:23.640 --> 18:25.800
<i>It can flow outward</i>
<i>and bring life to a desert.</i>

18:26.280 --> 18:27.760
He's very charming.

18:27.920 --> 18:30.440
You know, he's only on leave for a week.
Just show him a good time.

18:30.600 --> 18:32.840
I can't show him a good time.
You show him a good time.

18:35.840 --> 18:38.760
- Regina, it's for you.
- Hey--

18:40.720 --> 18:44.880
<i>Love can be a gas, light as air</i>
<i>and assuming the shape of its container.</i>

18:47.120 --> 18:49.800
I mean, it's crazy. I have been so busy
with other peoples' lives

18:49.960 --> 18:52.360
that I have paid no attention
to what's happening in mine.

18:52.520 --> 18:56.040
Like Todd. I mean, if he has feelings
for me, we need to talk about that,

18:56.200 --> 18:58.760
and about my feelings
about his feelings for me.

18:58.920 --> 19:02.040
Or if I have feelings for him
and my feelings about that.

19:02.200 --> 19:03.680
No?

19:04.360 --> 19:09.800
So I'm just gonna open up some wine
and settle in for a nice chat.

19:09.960 --> 19:11.480
White wine and feelings.

19:11.640 --> 19:13.520
He's a very lucky man.

19:13.680 --> 19:14.760
Good night, Ms. Newly.

19:14.920 --> 19:16.680
Good night, Frank.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.160
Hey, Todd?

19:22.320 --> 19:23.320
Hey,

19:23.480 --> 19:25.720
can we just talk about some--

19:26.000 --> 19:27.520
Hi.

19:28.040 --> 19:30.160
- You there.
- Hi.

19:30.320 --> 19:31.400
Hi.

19:31.560 --> 19:32.600
Sam.

19:32.760 --> 19:35.400
This is Cameron.
We were just going out.

19:35.560 --> 19:37.040
Yeah. Okay, good.

19:37.200 --> 19:39.800
Hi. That's-- You'll like that, yeah.

19:39.960 --> 19:41.080
And him.

19:41.240 --> 19:44.360
You'll like him, because he's not gay.

19:45.040 --> 19:46.600
You wanted to talk?

19:47.400 --> 19:49.800
Me? No, I'm good.

19:49.960 --> 19:51.320
Have fun. Yeah.

19:51.480 --> 19:55.760
Plus, I only got enough wine
for one, so...

19:55.920 --> 19:57.760
Oh, yeah.

20:04.840 --> 20:07.920
<i>And like matter,</i>
<i>love can't be created or destroyed.</i>

20:08.080 --> 20:09.320
<i>It's always there,</i>

20:09.480 --> 20:11.560
<i>even if you can't see it.</i>

20:12.360 --> 20:15.400
<i>Even if it's right there in front of you.</i>
