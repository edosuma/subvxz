09:40.580 --> 09:42.756
any one of them
can rip a horse in half--

09:42.843 --> 09:44.540
willing to follow
your every command.

09:44.627 --> 09:46.107
Well, you'd have
to do something

09:46.194 --> 09:47.325
really great with that.

09:47.412 --> 09:49.458
Something noble
and unselfish,

09:49.545 --> 09:51.155
but not too expensive.

09:51.242 --> 09:52.983
And we are not even
taking into account

09:53.070 --> 09:55.290
that I could easily
be led to the dark side.

09:55.377 --> 09:56.508
Lois,

09:56.596 --> 09:57.771
you have to promise me,

09:57.858 --> 09:59.511
if you ever
see me holding a cat

09:59.599 --> 10:01.470
and laughing maniacally
over a globe,

10:01.557 --> 10:02.950
you need to let me know.

10:06.214 --> 10:07.955
After this, I'll show you
how to play gin rummy.

10:08.042 --> 10:09.870
That's always been Mama's
favorite game.

10:09.957 --> 10:11.611
-Okay.
-So, Dewey, do you like

10:11.698 --> 10:13.134
being back in the normal class?

10:13.221 --> 10:15.049
[doorbell rings]

10:16.964 --> 10:17.921
Hello.

10:18.008 --> 10:20.141
Mrs. Welsh, what a surprise.

10:20.228 --> 10:21.969
If you're here to
check up on Dewey,

10:22.056 --> 10:24.580
I can assure you that he's just
as normal and wonderful...

10:24.667 --> 10:26.060
No, actually,
I just came to find out

10:26.147 --> 10:27.757
if Dewey's heard from any
of the children

10:27.844 --> 10:29.019
from the Special Needs class.

10:29.106 --> 10:30.412
No. Why?

10:30.499 --> 10:32.457
Well, uh, it seems
they've run away.

10:32.544 --> 10:33.720
[laughs]

10:33.807 --> 10:34.851
All of them?

10:34.938 --> 10:36.766
The whole class ran away?

10:36.853 --> 10:38.115
They just disappeared.

10:38.202 --> 10:39.551
[nervous laugh]

10:39.639 --> 10:41.815
Dewey, do you know anything
about this?

10:41.902 --> 10:43.730
Okay, well, thank you.

10:43.817 --> 10:46.297
And, if you hear anything,
please let me know?

10:46.384 --> 10:49.126
I'll see you.

10:49.213 --> 10:52.173
Oh, those kids.

10:52.260 --> 10:54.566
I'm so glad you're
out of that class.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.003
You know what?

10:56.090 --> 10:58.048
I think I'm gonna
bake you some cookies.

11:27.774 --> 11:28.905
We couldn't
take it anymore.

11:28.992 --> 11:29.993
It's horrible without you.

11:30.080 --> 11:31.386
We're never
going back.

11:31.473 --> 11:32.866
This is our new home.

11:32.953 --> 11:35.085
They'll never find us here.
It's perfect.

11:35.172 --> 11:37.348
We took blankets,
and we stole some food

11:37.435 --> 11:39.437
from a Dumpster outside
some restaurant.

11:39.524 --> 11:42.092
We kept thinking,
"What would Dewey do?"

11:42.179 --> 11:43.398
-KIDS: Yeah.
-DEWEY: You thought I'd

11:43.485 --> 11:45.226
steal food from the trash,

11:45.313 --> 11:50.013
and tell 20 kids to run away
and live in the trees forever?

11:50.100 --> 11:51.014
Well, maybe.

11:51.101 --> 11:52.581
But you can't stay up here.

11:52.668 --> 11:54.104
People are
looking for you.

11:54.191 --> 11:55.758
Mrs. Welsh
came to my house.

11:55.845 --> 11:57.238
We're never going home.

11:57.325 --> 11:58.674
You come live with us.

11:58.761 --> 12:00.458
The squirrels will have
to vote you in,

12:00.545 --> 12:01.982
but I'll put in a good word.

12:02.069 --> 12:03.505
No! This is crazy.

12:03.592 --> 12:06.247
I'm not living up here,
and neither are you.

12:06.334 --> 12:07.683
I'm sorry,
but I'm telling.

12:07.770 --> 12:09.250
You're not telling anyone.

12:09.337 --> 12:11.600
Do you realize how much
trouble you'd get in?

12:11.687 --> 12:12.644
What are you talking about?
I didn't...

Zoe?

12:13.602 --> 12:14.646
[sobbing]

12:14.734 --> 12:16.518
We didn't want to do it!

12:16.605 --> 12:18.868
It was Dewey's idea--

12:18.955 --> 12:20.043
the whole thing.

12:20.130 --> 12:23.177
He tricked us into it.

12:23.264 --> 12:26.484
Why is everyone so angry at us?

12:26.571 --> 12:29.357
Why did you make us
do this, Dewey?

12:34.579 --> 12:36.668
LOIS:
Dewey! Come get your cookies

12:36.756 --> 12:40.063

are still warm and melty!

Vroom, vroom.

12:44.415 --> 12:45.721
We've lost Dewey.

12:45.808 --> 12:47.375
It's the only
possible explanation.

12:47.462 --> 12:49.638
He's turned on us, and he's
feeding Mom information.

12:49.725 --> 12:50.987
This is bad. Real bad.

12:51.074 --> 12:52.119
I know.

12:52.206 --> 12:53.642
What does
he have on you?

12:53.729 --> 12:55.470
Oh, man, I have all
kinds of things going on

12:55.557 --> 12:56.471

12:56.558 --> 12:58.168

I'm noodling with...

13:01.693 --> 13:02.738
We don't have
any choice.

13:02.825 --> 13:03.957
We have to
neutralize him.

13:04.044 --> 13:06.176
Yeah, but how?

13:06.263 --> 13:08.265
Okay. We let
him "overhear"

13:08.352 --> 13:09.397
something
we're planning.

13:09.484 --> 13:10.877
Something way
across town.

13:10.964 --> 13:12.661
We make it so juicy
and horrible sounding,

13:12.748 --> 13:14.315
he won't be able to
resist telling Mom.

13:14.402 --> 13:16.621
So she waits in the cold
for three or four hours

13:16.708 --> 13:18.101
and, when
nothing happens,

13:18.188 --> 13:19.799
he's lost all
his credibility.

13:19.886 --> 13:21.061
Nice.

Ready to go to the

13:36.990 --> 13:38.730

wanton vandalism?

Yes. I've got

13:40.080 --> 13:41.255

and the flares

13:41.342 --> 13:42.473
for the senseless
destruction

13:42.560 --> 13:43.866
we've got planned.

13:43.953 --> 13:45.999
I sure hope Mom
doesn't ever find out.

13:46.086 --> 13:49.089
Don't worry about Mom--
she's too stupid!

13:49.176 --> 13:51.221
And besides, she's
probably busy stuffing

13:51.308 --> 13:52.483
her fat face.

13:52.570 --> 13:54.442
I sure hope Mom
doesn't ever

13:54.529 --> 13:56.052
find out
you said that.

13:56.139 --> 13:58.011
By the way,
do you think

13:58.098 --> 14:00.448
she's gotten
stupider or fatter?

14:00.535 --> 14:02.798
Good question.
I'd say...

me in to judge.

tummy is not gonna

14:13.374 --> 14:14.679
be as flat as
somebody else's,

14:14.766 --> 14:16.377

end up crying.

found those kids.

I think someone's

18:42.077 --> 18:44.471
It was nice
while it lasted.

18:44.558 --> 18:46.342
What do you mean,
not my concern?!

18:46.429 --> 18:49.302
How come no one ever cares
about any of my concerns?!

18:49.389 --> 18:50.781
Dewey! What are you doing?

18:50.868 --> 18:53.697
I've got so many feelings
running through my head,

18:53.784 --> 18:56.700
and I can't get any of them
straight, and they're pounding

18:56.787 --> 18:58.615
and they're pounding,
and I have to let them out!

18:58.702 --> 19:00.095
[shrieking]

19:00.182 --> 19:01.966
That kid's got to do
some work on his lats.

19:02.053 --> 19:04.230
-[Dewey shrieking]
-Dewey, knock it off!

19:04.317 --> 19:06.101
And stop drooling
this instant!

19:06.188 --> 19:08.712
And the hands and the people!
And the people and the hands!

19:08.799 --> 19:10.018
[Lois screams, all gasp]

19:10.105 --> 19:11.933
He's really not like this.

19:13.064 --> 19:14.805
[Dewey shrieking]

19:14.892 --> 19:16.633
I think it might
be best for everyone

19:16.720 --> 19:19.027
if Dewey goes back
into the Special Needs class,

19:19.114 --> 19:20.855
just for a while...

19:22.726 --> 19:24.424
See you later, honey.
I'm going to the park.

19:24.511 --> 19:27.688
Hal, it's that job you
interviewed for last week.

19:27.775 --> 19:29.994
They saw you on TV.
I think they want to hire you.

19:31.866 --> 19:33.128
Hello.

19:33.215 --> 19:35.174
Thank you.

19:35.261 --> 19:36.610
Sure, I can!

19:36.697 --> 19:37.872
Thank you.

19:37.959 --> 19:39.439
-LOIS: Yes! Yes! Yes!
-HAL: Yes!

19:39.526 --> 19:40.788
Oh, thank God!
I can't believe it.

19:40.875 --> 19:42.268
I know. Me, too.

19:42.355 --> 19:43.791
Oh! I was starting
to worry that neither

19:43.878 --> 19:45.358
of us was ever going
to find a job.

19:45.445 --> 19:46.750
I thought you were
going to spend

19:46.837 --> 19:48.187
the rest of your
life in the park.

19:50.493 --> 19:51.973
Okay, men, quiet down.

19:52.060 --> 19:53.844
I have some important news
I have to tell you.

19:53.931 --> 19:55.672
I...

19:55.759 --> 19:57.370
got a job.

20:01.156 --> 20:05.465
That means that I'll be going
to work during the day.

20:08.207 --> 20:12.123
Which means I won't be
coming to the park anymore.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.517
-Oh, no!
-[overlapping protests]

20:14.604 --> 20:16.476
You can't go nowhere.
We need you, Hal.

20:16.563 --> 20:18.173
What are we gonna
do without you?

20:18.260 --> 20:19.348
I'm going to miss you, too.

20:19.435 --> 20:20.784
I mean, this past week has been

20:20.871 --> 20:22.090
one of the best of my life.

20:23.352 --> 20:25.746
And you'll be fine.
I promise.

20:25.833 --> 20:27.138
Well, Eddie, look at you--

20:27.226 --> 20:29.619
using that ATM
like an old pro!

20:29.706 --> 20:31.752
I'd swear you've been
doing it all your life.

20:31.839 --> 20:33.623
-[men agreeing]
-And you, Marcus.

20:33.710 --> 20:35.234
Who's taping
Guiding Light

20:35.321 --> 20:37.148
and watching it with dinner?

20:37.236 --> 20:38.498
I know who!

20:38.585 --> 20:41.152
[laughs] And the rest
of you guys--

20:41.240 --> 20:44.808
you're amazing--
every one of you.

20:46.462 --> 20:49.335
Ah! Big, greasy goons.

20:52.642 --> 20:54.470
We'll never
forget you, Hal.

20:54.557 --> 20:56.298
You did so much for us.

20:56.385 --> 20:58.300
I wish we could
pay you back somehow.

20:58.387 --> 20:59.562
ALL:
Yeah.

20:59.649 --> 21:02.173
ALL [murmuring]:
Yeah.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.566
HAL:
Hi there.

21:03.653 --> 21:04.741
Today's my first day.

21:04.828 --> 21:06.221
I'm not sure where to go.

21:07.744 --> 21:09.093
Oh, it's okay.
They're with me.

21:11.748 --> 21:13.315
[men groaning]

21:13.402 --> 21:15.230
MAN: We're helping!
