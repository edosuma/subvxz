WEBVTT

00:03.195 --> 00:06.164
Captain's Log, Stardate 44307.3.

00:06.198 --> 00:09.292
I am preparing to leave
by shuttlecraft for Pentarus V

00:09.334 --> 00:11.802
where I've been asked
to mediate a dispute

00:11.837 --> 00:14.567
among the salenite miners,
a contentious group

00:14.606 --> 00:17.166
unfortunately,
prone to violence.

00:17.209 --> 00:20.178
But first, I must deal
with a situation

00:20.212 --> 00:22.510
of a far more personal nature.

00:22.547 --> 00:24.071
Sir?

00:28.220 --> 00:32.418
Mr. Crusher, I summoned you
almost ten minutes ago.

00:32.457 --> 00:34.084
Yes, sir, I'm sorry.

00:34.126 --> 00:36.151
I was in the middle
of a very important experiment.

00:36.194 --> 00:37.786
I was using some
very volatile compounds.

00:37.829 --> 00:39.023
I couldn't just leave them...

00:39.064 --> 00:40.031
Excuses, Mr. Crusher?

00:40.065 --> 00:41.896
No, sir. I was just
attempting to offer...

00:41.933 --> 00:42.991
Because I can assure you

00:43.035 --> 00:45.162
that will not go down well
at Starfleet Academy.

00:45.203 --> 00:47.728
Yes, sir, I'm aware of that.

00:53.078 --> 00:54.875
The Academy?

00:54.913 --> 00:58.212
I just received a message
from Admiral Nsomeka.

00:58.250 --> 01:01.219
She expects you
to report in two weeks.

01:01.286 --> 01:03.982
A position has opened up
in this year's class.

01:04.022 --> 01:05.649
Thank you.

01:05.691 --> 01:07.886
Now, you're going
to have to work overtime

01:07.926 --> 01:09.484
in order to catch up

01:09.528 --> 01:12.622
but I have assured the Admiral
that you are capable of it.

01:12.664 --> 01:14.564
Please, don't make
a liar out of me.

01:14.599 --> 01:15.759
Oh, no, sir, I won't.

01:15.801 --> 01:18.736
Well, for your final mission
on board the <i>Enterprise</i>

01:18.770 --> 01:20.761
you will accompany me
to Pentarus V

01:20.806 --> 01:23.900
while I try to sort out
the problems with the miners.

01:23.942 --> 01:27.139
Commander Riker has told me
that you have been studying

01:27.179 --> 01:29.613
the effects of outpost
judiciary decisions

01:29.648 --> 01:30.672
on Federation law.

01:30.716 --> 01:33.344
What better way to get
first-hand experience?

01:33.385 --> 01:34.852
Captain, I am picking up

01:34.886 --> 01:37.411
a general distress signal
from Gamelan V.

01:37.456 --> 01:39.219
On screen.

01:40.826 --> 01:43.386
Please, does anyone read us?

01:43.428 --> 01:45.362
Open a channel.

01:45.397 --> 01:48.195
I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard

01:48.233 --> 01:51.202
of the Federation
Starship <i>Enterprise. </i>

01:51.236 --> 01:54.535
Captain, I am Chairman Songi
of Gamelan V.

01:54.573 --> 01:56.598
An unidentified spacecraft

01:56.641 --> 01:59.337
has entered orbit
above our planet.

01:59.378 --> 02:01.972
Radiation levels
in our atmosphere

02:02.013 --> 02:04.481
have increased by 3,000 percent.

02:04.516 --> 02:07.576
We can only assume
we are under attack

02:07.619 --> 02:10.144
but the ship will not answer
our hails.

02:10.255 --> 02:11.916
We are a peaceful planet.

02:11.957 --> 02:14.585
We have no ability
to defend ourselves.

02:14.626 --> 02:17.254
Please, can you help us?

02:17.295 --> 02:19.855
Mr. Data, are we close enough
for a scan?

02:19.898 --> 02:22.628
No, sir, we are out of range.

02:22.667 --> 02:24.828
Any other ships in that sector?

02:24.870 --> 02:26.497
Negative, Commander.

02:26.538 --> 02:29.803
Chairman Songi, we'll proceed
immediately to your planet.

02:29.841 --> 02:31.866
Thank you, Captain.

02:31.910 --> 02:33.605
Commander Riker,
take the <i>Enterprise</i>

02:33.645 --> 02:34.976
and investigate the problem.

02:35.013 --> 02:37.345
Ensign Crusher and I will
proceed to Pentarus V.

02:37.382 --> 02:38.872
The miners have sent a shuttle.

02:38.917 --> 02:40.350
We shall leave in ten minutes.

02:40.385 --> 02:42.216
Yes, sir.

02:49.895 --> 02:53.922
You know, I've noticed here
that your maneuvering thrusters

02:53.965 --> 02:57.401
are rigged in a configuration
I've never seen before.

02:57.436 --> 03:00.200
It's my own modification.

03:00.305 --> 03:02.398
It's more efficient.

03:02.441 --> 03:04.875
You can study it if you want.

03:06.077 --> 03:07.772
Excuse me, Captain.

03:09.848 --> 03:11.839
I've run safety and operational
inspections, Captain.

03:11.883 --> 03:13.043
Everything checks out all right

03:13.084 --> 03:14.847
but I won't make any claims
as to its comfort.

03:14.886 --> 03:16.513
Captain Picard.

03:16.555 --> 03:19.285
Captain Dirgo
of the Shuttlecraft <i>Nenebek. </i>

03:19.324 --> 03:21.315
Ah, Captain.

03:21.359 --> 03:23.520
It's good to meet you.

03:30.068 --> 03:33.094
Captain?
Of a mining shuttle?

03:33.138 --> 03:35.003
Yes, Ensign, Captain.

03:35.040 --> 03:36.473
My ship isn't pretty.

03:36.508 --> 03:37.770
She isn't big.

03:37.809 --> 03:40.676
But we've logged almost
10,000 hours together.

03:40.712 --> 03:42.339
Oh, yes.

03:42.380 --> 03:44.348
She seems a very...

03:44.382 --> 03:46.350
a very sturdy craft.

03:46.384 --> 03:48.045
We should go.

03:50.222 --> 03:52.520
Captain, will you take Ops?

03:52.557 --> 03:55.526
I'll let Ensign Crusher
perform that task.

03:55.560 --> 03:58.723
I have to study up
on Regalian law.

04:00.000 --> 04:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:08.273 --> 04:10.639
Shuttlecraft has
cleared the bay, sir.

04:10.675 --> 04:13.303
Ensign Allenby, set a course
for the Gamelan system.

04:13.345 --> 04:14.471
Warp six.

04:14.513 --> 04:15.741
Aye, sir.

04:21.786 --> 04:23.811
You've done this before.

04:23.855 --> 04:25.823
Yes.

04:25.857 --> 04:29.258
Your Captain back there, if he
isn't tougher than he looks

04:29.294 --> 04:31.159
those miners
will tear him apart.

04:31.229 --> 04:33.163
Don't worry
about Captain Picard.

04:33.231 --> 04:34.323
He'll handle them.

04:36.735 --> 04:37.929
I've lost navigation.

04:37.969 --> 04:41.097
The port thruster quad's gone.

04:41.139 --> 04:44.597
Guidance coupling system
severed.

04:44.643 --> 04:47.011
I can't stabilize her.

05:18.442 --> 05:22.845
Space, the final frontier.

05:22.880 --> 05:26.714
These are the voyages
of the Starship <i>Enterprise. </i>

05:26.750 --> 05:28.718
Its continuing mission...

05:28.752 --> 05:32.688
to explore strange new worlds

05:32.723 --> 05:37.126
to seek out new life
and new civilizations

05:37.194 --> 05:41.688
to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

06:43.691 --> 06:46.660
The port thruster module blew.

06:46.694 --> 06:49.128
<i>Nenebek</i> to <i>Enterprise. </i>
Emergency.

06:49.163 --> 06:50.152
Do you read?

06:51.265 --> 06:54.234
Pentarus Station, come in.

06:54.268 --> 06:57.032
Communication's gone.

06:57.071 --> 06:59.335
Is your navigational
system functioning?

06:59.373 --> 07:01.102
Negative.
Switching to manual.

07:01.141 --> 07:04.076
50 million kilometers
to Pentarus V.

07:04.144 --> 07:06.442
We may have to put down
somewhere else.

07:06.480 --> 07:09.972
Mr. Crusher, scan
for a Class-M environment.

07:10.017 --> 07:11.746
Aye, sir.

07:13.087 --> 07:14.850
I'm going to have
to throttle back

07:14.888 --> 07:16.412
on the main impulse engines.

07:18.659 --> 07:21.093
Sir, one of the moons
around Pentarus Ill...

07:21.195 --> 07:22.560
it registers as Class-M

07:22.596 --> 07:23.563
barely.

07:23.597 --> 07:25.087
The mean surface temperature

07:25.165 --> 07:26.564
is 55 degrees Celsius.

07:26.600 --> 07:27.931
Life-forms indicated?

07:27.968 --> 07:30.562
Uh, negative,
but scanning is limited.

07:30.604 --> 07:33.038
There's a very strong magnetic
field around the surface.

07:33.073 --> 07:35.064
We don't have a choice.

07:42.649 --> 07:45.948
Save the impulse engine
for controlled entry.

07:45.986 --> 07:49.513
Mr. Crusher, reconfigure
working thrusters

07:49.556 --> 07:50.716
to manual input.

07:50.758 --> 07:53.386
I'll try, sir, but this grid
looks about 100 years old.

07:53.427 --> 07:56.089
We don't have
the Federation's resources.

07:56.130 --> 07:57.927
Captain, take the helm.

07:59.266 --> 08:02.133
I'm re-routing
the deuterium flow.

08:04.104 --> 08:06.072
Hull temperature 700 degrees.

08:06.140 --> 08:07.937
Beginning braking maneuver.

08:09.610 --> 08:11.544
We're below Mach One.

08:11.578 --> 08:13.773
Bypass to thrusters now.

08:15.649 --> 08:18.447
Brace yourselves for impact.

08:43.977 --> 08:45.103
Dear God.

08:46.280 --> 08:48.805
Let's salvage what we can.

08:55.823 --> 08:59.418
The first thing we'll need
is shelter from the sun.

09:05.432 --> 09:09.926
In this heat, the shuttle
will act like an oven.

09:11.438 --> 09:13.531
All the systems are out.

09:13.574 --> 09:16.509
Can't get
a communication channel.

09:16.543 --> 09:19.410
Location transponder's
gone, too.

09:19.446 --> 09:21.414
Let's check the craft

09:21.448 --> 09:24.679
for something to protect
our heads and eyes.

09:24.718 --> 09:28.085
And, Captain, please recover
your medical supplies

09:28.121 --> 09:30.089
food and water rations.

09:30.123 --> 09:31.590
Well, the medical supplies
are all right.

09:33.760 --> 09:36.538
Food and water?

09:36.671 --> 09:39.731
The replicator...

09:39.774 --> 09:42.402
damaged beyond repair.

09:42.444 --> 09:45.538
Surely you have
emergency supplies.

09:45.580 --> 09:48.344
This isn't a starship.

09:48.383 --> 09:52.080
I have to choose what I carry.

09:52.120 --> 09:55.317
Are you telling me
there's no water?

10:19.781 --> 10:21.646
Scanning.

10:21.683 --> 10:24.117
The vessel reads as an unmanned
sublight freighter.

10:24.152 --> 10:25.779
Origin?

10:25.820 --> 10:27.447
Indeterminate.

10:27.489 --> 10:31.482
Propulsion appears to employ
a gaseous-core fission reactor

10:31.526 --> 10:33.323
but it is not functioning.

10:33.361 --> 10:36.296
The radiation levels from
that ship are off the scale.

10:36.331 --> 10:38.128
Could that be leakage
from their engines?

10:38.233 --> 10:39.564
No, sir.

10:39.601 --> 10:42.695
Engine reactor elements
appear to have been inactive

10:42.737 --> 10:44.432
for approximately 300 years.

10:44.472 --> 10:47.771
The vessel is carrying
various unstable waste products.

10:47.809 --> 10:49.868
You mean it's a garbage scow.

10:49.911 --> 10:51.276
Precisely.

10:51.312 --> 10:53.337
Mr. Worf, open
a hailing frequency.

10:53.381 --> 10:55.815
Chairman Songi,
this is Commander Riker

10:55.850 --> 10:57.784
on board the <i>Enterprise. </i>

10:57.819 --> 10:59.446
Yes, Commander.

10:59.487 --> 11:02.718
It appears you have inherited
someone else's problem...

11:02.757 --> 11:03.883
an old waste vessel

11:03.925 --> 11:06.519
caught by your planet's
gravitational pull.

11:06.561 --> 11:10.088
Have your people begun to suffer
from radiation sickness?

11:10.198 --> 11:12.098
Not yet, but some areas

11:12.200 --> 11:14.998
are already detecting
dangerous levels.

11:15.036 --> 11:16.799
We'll do our best
to get it out of here

11:16.838 --> 11:17.930
as quickly as possible.

11:17.972 --> 11:19.769
Thank you, Commander.

11:19.808 --> 11:23.005
We're going to push that
barge into the Gamelan sun.

11:23.044 --> 11:27.504
Sir, the Meltasion asteroid belt
lies between here and the sun.

11:27.549 --> 11:28.675
Then we'll take it in ourselves.

11:28.717 --> 11:29.684
We'll use our deflectors

11:29.718 --> 11:31.083
to clear a path
through the asteroids.

11:31.119 --> 11:33.110
I don't like the idea
of getting close enough

11:33.188 --> 11:34.120
to that barge to tow it.

11:34.189 --> 11:35.918
The radiation levels are
so high, we'd be risking

11:35.957 --> 11:37.288
the contamination
of the entire crew.

11:37.325 --> 11:39.122
Do you have a better idea,
Geordi?

11:39.227 --> 11:41.422
We could send
a construction module over

11:41.463 --> 11:42.953
to attach thrusters to it.

11:42.997 --> 11:44.123
Then we could direct it

11:44.199 --> 11:46.565
through the asteroid belt
from a safe distance.

11:46.601 --> 11:47.590
Commander, a message

11:47.635 --> 11:49.694
from the mining
settlement on Pentarus V.

11:49.738 --> 11:51.797
The shuttlecraft
carrying Captain Picard

11:51.840 --> 11:53.137
has not yet arrived.

11:53.208 --> 11:55.108
They left here at 0800 hours.

11:55.143 --> 11:58.135
They have asked
if we are beginning a search.

12:01.382 --> 12:03.373
Tell them we have
an emergency situation.

12:03.418 --> 12:06.080
We will begin a search
as soon as we've completed that.

12:06.187 --> 12:07.245
Aye, sir.

12:07.288 --> 12:09.722
Mr. La Forge, prepare to launch
the construction module.

12:09.758 --> 12:12.784
I'd like to get this over with
as fast as possible.

12:19.400 --> 12:20.697
Any luck with the tricorder,
Ensign?

12:20.735 --> 12:22.362
I think so, sir.

12:22.403 --> 12:24.098
The scanning range
may be a bit limited

12:24.172 --> 12:25.503
but it's better than nothing.

12:26.574 --> 12:28.667
These were on board, Captain.
They're working.

12:28.710 --> 12:30.337
Excellent.

12:30.378 --> 12:33.973
Our communicators
may not be able to get a signal

12:34.015 --> 12:36.609
through this strong
a magnetic field.

12:36.651 --> 12:39.984
I'm fashioning an arrow.

12:40.021 --> 12:43.218
If a search party
finds the wreckage

12:43.258 --> 12:47.718
they'll know that we've
headed for those mountains.

12:47.762 --> 12:48.729
Are you crazy?

12:48.763 --> 12:49.923
They're too far away.

12:49.964 --> 12:51.158
We'll never make it.

12:53.334 --> 12:56.030
We can't survive in this sun.

12:56.070 --> 13:00.598
Where there's mountains,
there's shelter.

13:00.642 --> 13:02.974
You've got no right
to make the decisions.

13:03.011 --> 13:04.740
I'm the Captain of this ship.

13:04.779 --> 13:06.076
If you want to get out of this

13:06.181 --> 13:08.012
I suggest you listen
to Captain Picard.

13:08.049 --> 13:10.017
He's the one who's going
to keep us alive.

13:10.051 --> 13:11.609
Thank you, Ensign.
That's enough.

13:16.791 --> 13:19.760
Captain Dirgo,
you're an able pilot.

13:19.794 --> 13:21.591
I welcome your input.

13:21.629 --> 13:24.029
Do you feel that there
is an alternative

13:24.065 --> 13:25.191
we're overlooking?

13:32.140 --> 13:33.767
No.

13:33.808 --> 13:35.776
Very well.

13:35.810 --> 13:39.576
I suggest a steady pace,
not a brisk one.

13:39.614 --> 13:41.309
We need to ration our energy.

13:41.349 --> 13:43.249
Try breathing through your nose.

13:43.284 --> 13:45.252
That way, it will help
to prevent dehydration.

13:45.286 --> 13:46.378
I'll lead.

13:46.421 --> 13:48.616
Captain Dirgo, will you
bring up the rear?

14:45.146 --> 14:49.139
And you were worried
about how tough the Captain is?

15:26.454 --> 15:28.251
Did you find water?

15:28.289 --> 15:29.551
No, not yet.

15:29.590 --> 15:31.888
What are you doing with that?

15:31.926 --> 15:32.915
Mr. Crusher?

15:36.130 --> 15:38.462
I'm not sure, sir.

15:40.468 --> 15:42.436
It's an energy reading.

15:42.470 --> 15:44.938
Energy reading?
What kind?

15:44.973 --> 15:46.941
Low frequency EM.

15:46.975 --> 15:48.408
It's been getting stronger

15:48.443 --> 15:50.434
the closer we get
to those mountains.

15:50.478 --> 15:54.107
What are you saying?
There's something over there?

15:54.148 --> 15:55.775
Waiting for us?

15:55.817 --> 15:58.047
I'm not sure what it is.

15:58.086 --> 16:02.386
It just keeps registering
as a repeating energy pattern.

16:02.423 --> 16:04.050
Ensign, are you suggesting

16:04.125 --> 16:07.060
that this energy is not
naturally occurring?

16:07.095 --> 16:08.960
These readings
could be indicative

16:08.997 --> 16:11.625
of some electromagnetic
properties in the rocks

16:11.666 --> 16:13.691
but I don't think so.

16:13.735 --> 16:15.362
A life-form?

16:15.403 --> 16:17.030
It's possible.

16:17.071 --> 16:19.699
The pattern is fairly organized.

16:22.777 --> 16:26.076
Well, we can't go back.

16:26.114 --> 16:29.413
We can't stay here.

16:29.450 --> 16:34.251
We've got to keep going
for those mountains...

16:34.288 --> 16:37.451
no matter what
is waiting for us.

17:17.650 --> 17:20.448
There has to be water in here.

17:20.486 --> 17:22.454
Aren't caves formed by water?

17:22.488 --> 17:24.955
Not necessarily.

17:24.990 --> 17:27.959
This could be created
by volcanic activity...

17:27.992 --> 17:30.427
lava flow...
these walls are dry.

17:30.462 --> 17:32.953
Mr. Crusher, do you have
any moisture reading?

17:32.998 --> 17:34.124
No, sir.

17:34.166 --> 17:36.134
But that EM reading...

17:36.168 --> 17:38.136
the pattern's changed.

17:38.170 --> 17:41.003
The frequency's
peaking a lot higher.

17:46.245 --> 17:48.475
You have water!

17:48.514 --> 17:50.311
I wouldn't hide water.

17:52.418 --> 17:54.249
That's called <i>dresci. </i>

17:54.286 --> 17:56.277
It's from my planet.

18:00.292 --> 18:01.884
It's alcohol.

18:01.927 --> 18:03.588
It's medicinal.

18:03.629 --> 18:04.789
It's for emergencies.

18:04.830 --> 18:06.297
I was going to share
it with you.

18:06.332 --> 18:07.822
This wouldn't
quench your thirst.

18:07.866 --> 18:08.958
It would make it worse.

18:09.001 --> 18:10.992
Well, I'll take my chances.

18:11.070 --> 18:12.799
I'm not going to let
you waste this.

18:12.838 --> 18:14.829
This is more valuable
to us as a coolant

18:14.873 --> 18:15.862
a disinfectant.

18:15.908 --> 18:17.000
It's mine.

18:17.042 --> 18:19.010
Mr. Crusher, stow that
with the medical supplies.

18:19.044 --> 18:20.011
Keep your eye on it.

18:20.045 --> 18:21.740
All right, we're going
to explore the cave.

18:21.780 --> 18:24.010
Mr. Crusher, look out
for any signs of water

18:24.116 --> 18:25.174
no matter how faint.

18:25.217 --> 18:28.550
Captain Dirgo,
will you lead the way?

18:48.474 --> 18:50.840
We're projecting
that the bulk of the radiation

18:50.876 --> 18:52.810
will affect
three small island groups.

18:54.913 --> 18:57.575
Fortunately, they're
very sparsely populated.

18:57.616 --> 18:59.345
We'll begin
replicating hyronalin now

18:59.385 --> 19:02.377
and be ready to transport it to
them, if it becomes necessary.

19:02.421 --> 19:05.481
Please coordinate with all the
medical personnel on the planet.

19:05.524 --> 19:06.821
Beverly.

19:10.529 --> 19:13.225
We've contacted
the nearest Starbase

19:13.265 --> 19:14.823
for a search vessel.

19:14.867 --> 19:16.892
I'm afraid the closest one

19:16.935 --> 19:18.766
is almost a week away.

19:18.804 --> 19:20.271
I see.

19:20.306 --> 19:22.001
Thank you.

19:22.107 --> 19:24.940
But we have asked
the mining settlement

19:24.977 --> 19:27.946
to send any vessels
they might have.

19:27.980 --> 19:30.505
You know, there
are many reasons

19:30.549 --> 19:34.110
why the shuttlecraft
may have been delayed.

19:34.153 --> 19:38.613
Deanna, thank you,
but I'm all right.

19:38.657 --> 19:41.785
And right now,
I have work to do.

19:49.134 --> 19:50.465
Commander, the miners report

19:50.502 --> 19:52.402
they have very few
operable shuttlecraft.

19:52.438 --> 19:54.929
They want to know when we
will be joining the search.

19:54.973 --> 19:56.031
Tell them to stand by.

19:56.075 --> 19:57.702
If this works,
we'll be on our way.

19:57.743 --> 19:58.732
Aye, sir.

19:58.777 --> 20:00.608
Thrusters are attached
and ready, Commander.

20:00.646 --> 20:02.307
Initiate prefire sequence.

20:02.348 --> 20:03.645
Prefire sequence transmitted.

20:03.682 --> 20:05.343
Thrusters to standby.

20:05.384 --> 20:06.476
Fire thrusters.

20:15.394 --> 20:16.691
We've lost one module.

20:16.729 --> 20:18.424
Correcting thrust vectors
to compensate.

20:18.464 --> 20:20.056
Structural integrity
of the barge

20:20.165 --> 20:21.223
has been compromised.

20:21.266 --> 20:22.790
Disintegration is continuing.

20:22.835 --> 20:24.325
Shut down thrusters.

20:24.370 --> 20:28.067
Ensign, take us to 1,000 meters
ahead of the barge and hold.

20:28.173 --> 20:30.004
External radiation
levels increasing, sir.

20:30.042 --> 20:31.600
Coming into position
at 1,000 meters.

20:31.643 --> 20:33.440
Worf, extend the shields
around the ship.

20:33.479 --> 20:34.571
Lock on the tractor beam.

20:34.613 --> 20:35.602
Aye, sir.

20:41.653 --> 20:45.851
Warning. Radiation levels
at 70 millirads per minute

20:45.891 --> 20:47.085
and rising.

20:47.126 --> 20:48.218
Allenby, set a new course.

20:48.260 --> 20:50.057
We'll take it through
the asteroid belt ourselves.

20:50.095 --> 20:51.062
One quarter impulse.

20:51.096 --> 20:52.063
Aye, sir.

20:52.097 --> 20:53.359
Dr. Crusher, to the Bridge.

20:53.399 --> 20:54.627
On my way.

20:54.666 --> 20:55.758
Mr. Data, I'll need a projection

20:55.801 --> 20:57.098
of the radiation's
impact on the crew.

20:57.202 --> 21:00.933
Mr. Worf, contact
the mining settlement.

21:00.973 --> 21:04.409
Tell them we won't be joining
the search for a while.

21:34.949 --> 21:36.678
I knew there had to be water.

21:42.557 --> 21:43.524
What was that?

21:43.558 --> 21:45.150
It seems to be
a tightly-confined

21:45.193 --> 21:46.455
annular force field, sir.

21:46.494 --> 21:49.258
Placed there
to protect the water.

21:49.297 --> 21:51.765
Yes. There has to be a way
to deactivate it, sir.

21:51.800 --> 21:53.859
We can, with our phasers.

21:53.902 --> 21:57.030
Mr. Dirgo, I think
it would be wiser...

21:57.105 --> 21:58.868
Captain, the EM reading...

21:58.907 --> 22:01.034
the power level's
really spiking now.

22:01.109 --> 22:02.576
I think it's working.

22:02.610 --> 22:04.202
Dirgo...

22:11.486 --> 22:12.646
Stop firing!

22:15.523 --> 22:16.615
Wesley!

22:33.475 --> 22:35.966
Apply pressure to that wound.

22:47.889 --> 22:49.948
This is the worst break.

22:49.991 --> 22:51.891
What was that thing?

22:51.926 --> 22:53.917
Keep the pressure constant!

23:09.944 --> 23:12.071
Ensign...

23:12.113 --> 23:13.580
how bad is it?

23:13.615 --> 23:16.345
Your right leg is broken.

23:16.384 --> 23:19.080
You have a fracture
in your left arm

23:19.120 --> 23:21.247
and you took a blow to the head.

23:21.289 --> 23:24.690
But we're getting the bleeding
under control.

23:24.726 --> 23:27.752
Well done.

23:27.796 --> 23:29.491
I'm going to be fine.

23:29.531 --> 23:33.467
I just... just need...

23:33.501 --> 23:35.526
to get my breath.

23:35.570 --> 23:38.767
Will you tell him the truth?

23:38.807 --> 23:40.434
What truth?

23:40.475 --> 23:42.102
He's bleeding inside.

23:42.143 --> 23:43.610
I've seen it before.

23:43.645 --> 23:45.772
He's never going to survive.

23:45.814 --> 23:48.544
You don't know
what you're talking about.

23:50.585 --> 23:52.382
You're wasting your time.

23:52.420 --> 23:54.547
Will you save
that <i>dresci</i> for us?

23:54.589 --> 23:57.217
Mr. Dirgo,
I would appreciate it

23:57.258 --> 24:00.659
if you didn't bury me
before I'm gone.

24:13.741 --> 24:16.869
The trouble is
he could be right.

24:16.911 --> 24:18.071
No, he's not, sir.

24:18.112 --> 24:19.875
You're going to be fine.

24:19.914 --> 24:25.580
Wesley, you are going to have
to keep a... a rein on Dirgo.

24:25.620 --> 24:28.111
He's willful, stubborn.

24:28.156 --> 24:30.090
That's dangerous.

24:30.124 --> 24:31.921
You'll handle him, sir.

24:31.960 --> 24:33.484
Wesley, listen to me.

24:33.528 --> 24:38.591
I have no feeling
in my right leg.

24:38.633 --> 24:41.602
My vision is blurred.

24:41.636 --> 24:44.469
I'm going to get worse,
not better.

24:46.441 --> 24:49.205
I'm not going to be able
to help you.

24:49.244 --> 24:53.544
No, you are going to have to
stand up to Dirgo on your own.

24:57.752 --> 24:59.117
Yes, sir.

24:59.153 --> 25:02.589
Hey... good man.

25:10.623 --> 25:14.582
First Officer's Log,
Stardate 44307.6.

25:14.627 --> 25:18.256
Radiation levels on the
<i>Enterprise</i> continue to rise.

25:18.298 --> 25:21.267
The ventilation system
has started pumping hyronalin

25:21.301 --> 25:23.929
into our air supply
to counteract the effects.

25:24.003 --> 25:26.631
At the rate the radiation
levels are increasing

25:26.673 --> 25:29.198
the hyronalin additive
will only be effective

25:29.242 --> 25:30.573
for another 38 minutes.

25:30.610 --> 25:32.202
Crusher to Medical Unit One.

25:32.245 --> 25:34.611
Evacuate and seal off
all non-operational areas.

25:34.647 --> 25:36.171
Group the crew
and their families

25:36.215 --> 25:38.547
in the interior corridors
of decks nine and ten.

25:38.585 --> 25:40.712
Radiation exposure protocol.

25:40.753 --> 25:41.811
Acknowledged, Doctor.

25:41.854 --> 25:44.152
Mr. Data, at our current speed,
how long will it take us

25:44.190 --> 25:45.555
to get through
the asteroid belt?

25:45.592 --> 25:47.719
51 Minutes, 14 seconds, sir.

25:47.760 --> 25:49.159
There's going to be
a lot of casualties

25:49.195 --> 25:50.389
if we can't get there
any faster.

25:50.430 --> 25:52.898
Mr. La Forge, how much more can
we get out of that tractor beam?

25:52.932 --> 25:54.263
We're already
at the maximum limits

25:54.300 --> 25:55.528
of our towing speed, Commander.

25:55.568 --> 25:57.968
Let's see if we can establish
a new upper limit.

25:58.037 --> 25:59.334
Yes, sir.

25:59.372 --> 26:01.499
Data, monitor
the shearing effect on the beam.

26:01.541 --> 26:03.065
Increasing to one-half impulse.

26:10.016 --> 26:11.677
Tractor beam is holding.

26:11.718 --> 26:14.516
Shearing force,
80 metric tons per meter.

26:14.554 --> 26:17.853
Increasing
to three-quarters impulse.

26:22.895 --> 26:25.659
Shearing force, 92 metric tons.

26:25.698 --> 26:27.495
Ninety-three.

26:27.533 --> 26:29.057
Tractor beam is destabilizing.

26:29.102 --> 26:31.332
We are going to lose
the barge, Commander.

26:31.371 --> 26:33.532
Reduce power.

26:33.573 --> 26:35.768
One-half impulse.

26:35.808 --> 26:37.867
Geordi, you've got
to stabilize that tractor beam.

26:37.910 --> 26:39.605
I can't divert any more power
to the shields.

26:39.646 --> 26:41.546
We're already hitting
our maximum thermal limits.

26:41.581 --> 26:42.639
Only other choice is to bring

26:42.682 --> 26:43.944
some other fusion reactors
on-line

26:44.017 --> 26:46.884
but we're running
at peak coolant pressure.

26:46.919 --> 26:48.546
Do it.

26:48.588 --> 26:51.523
Warning. Radiation levels

26:51.557 --> 26:54.958
at 150 millirads per minute,
and rising.

26:54.994 --> 26:57.622
Lethal exposure in 35 minutes.

27:03.870 --> 27:05.167
Look at that.

27:05.204 --> 27:07.536
The phaser.

27:22.221 --> 27:23.848
How did this happen?

27:23.890 --> 27:25.755
That thing did it.

27:29.896 --> 27:34.560
These are selenium fibers...
electrically deposited.

27:42.075 --> 27:44.566
The EM pattern is back down.

27:48.981 --> 27:53.645
It only peaks
when we move towards the water.

27:53.686 --> 27:57.144
Whatever we saw
must act like... a sentry

27:57.190 --> 27:59.750
to try to guard the fountain.

27:59.792 --> 28:02.352
When we're not moving
towards the water

28:02.395 --> 28:04.829
the wave pattern stays low...

28:04.864 --> 28:07.594
right here
between five and 15 megahertz.

28:09.268 --> 28:10.792
Dirgo, move toward the fountain.

28:14.574 --> 28:15.871
Dirgo.

28:26.219 --> 28:27.516
There.

28:27.553 --> 28:29.544
It just went to 40.

28:31.557 --> 28:33.184
What is this getting us?

28:33.226 --> 28:35.319
We've got to get to the water.

28:35.361 --> 28:38.558
If I can figure out
how to manipulate the frequency

28:38.598 --> 28:40.065
maybe I can control it.

28:40.099 --> 28:43.933
Now, the sentry first appeared
when you used your phaser.

28:43.970 --> 28:46.370
That means it could respond
to heat or collinated energy...

28:46.405 --> 28:47.531
If you're right

28:47.573 --> 28:49.268
we can use a phaser
to lure it away.

28:49.308 --> 28:50.605
Hold on. We need

28:50.643 --> 28:52.543
to know what we're dealing with
before we do anything.

28:52.578 --> 28:53.875
No, enough talking,
enough thinking.

28:53.913 --> 28:55.141
It's time to do something.

28:55.181 --> 28:56.307
I'll start firing.

28:56.349 --> 28:59.079
When it comes,
you fire and draw it away.

28:59.118 --> 29:00.085
Dirgo, I can't.

29:00.119 --> 29:01.245
Put your phaser on automatic

29:01.287 --> 29:03.482
leave it on that ledge
and take cover.

29:03.523 --> 29:06.424
And what makes you think
it's going to go for my phaser

29:06.459 --> 29:07.483
and not for yours?

29:07.527 --> 29:09.358
Because I'll be firing
at the lowest setting.

29:09.395 --> 29:10.362
You use maximum.

29:10.396 --> 29:11.454
There is no evidence

29:11.497 --> 29:13.362
that it responds differently
to higher settings.

29:13.399 --> 29:15.196
We have to figure out
our options before we just...

29:15.234 --> 29:17.794
While we are doing that,
your Captain is dying.

29:17.837 --> 29:22.171
Wounds like that,
most men would be dead already.

29:22.208 --> 29:24.540
If he doesn't get water...

29:26.546 --> 29:29.947
When I start firing,
you better do your part.

30:31.075 --> 30:33.669
First Officer's Log,
supplemental.

30:33.711 --> 30:36.908
Mr. La Forge has diverted power
from auxiliary fusion generators

30:36.947 --> 30:39.507
in an attempt
to stabilize the tractor beam.

30:39.550 --> 30:42.178
This is the only hope
of increasing our towing speed

30:42.219 --> 30:44.153
so we can clear
the asteroid belt

30:44.188 --> 30:46.418
before radiation levels
become fatal.

30:46.457 --> 30:47.947
Warning. Radiation levels

30:47.992 --> 30:51.086
at 300 millirads
per minute, and rising.

30:51.128 --> 30:53.221
Lethal exposure in one minute.

30:53.263 --> 30:54.423
Ready, Commander.

30:54.465 --> 30:56.558
I'll be rotating the output
of the auxiliary reactors

30:56.600 --> 30:58.465
but it should still give us
the power we need.

30:58.502 --> 30:59.491
Proceed, Mr. La Forge.

30:59.536 --> 31:01.333
Increasing
to three quarters impulse.

31:01.372 --> 31:04.808
Shearing force is
at 103 metric tons.

31:04.842 --> 31:05.934
Tractor beam is stable.

31:05.976 --> 31:07.603
Full impulse.

31:12.650 --> 31:14.277
Tractor beam is holding.

31:14.318 --> 31:16.946
Warning. Lethal radiation
exposure in 30 seconds.

31:17.021 --> 31:20.479
We are within visual range
of the asteroid belt.

31:20.524 --> 31:21.548
On screen.

31:22.893 --> 31:25.054
Warning.

31:25.095 --> 31:28.155
Lethal radiation exposure
in 15 seconds.

31:28.198 --> 31:30.496
Prepare to cut the barge loose.

31:30.534 --> 31:34.368
Warning. Lethal radiation
exposure in ten seconds.

31:35.406 --> 31:36.805
We have cleared
the asteroids, sir.

31:36.840 --> 31:38.865
Let it go.

31:52.289 --> 31:53.950
Cold.

31:56.960 --> 32:00.794
When the sun went down,
the temperature really dropped.

32:00.831 --> 32:02.822
This should help.

32:07.671 --> 32:10.504
Oh, good.

32:10.541 --> 32:11.838
Thank you.

32:15.846 --> 32:19.213
I'm not much good
to you, Wesley.

32:19.249 --> 32:21.479
Sir...

32:21.518 --> 32:24.351
Dirgo is dead.

32:24.388 --> 32:27.983
I should have tried harder
to stop him, but he...

32:30.194 --> 32:33.163
Captain?

32:33.197 --> 32:35.859
Captain Picard?

32:35.899 --> 32:38.868
Sir, stay with me.

32:41.205 --> 32:42.934
I'm trying.

32:46.210 --> 32:47.973
Sir...

32:50.881 --> 32:54.840
Do you remember when we took
the shuttlecraft together

32:54.885 --> 32:56.614
to Starbase 515?

32:58.555 --> 33:00.921
Oh, I was dreading it.

33:00.958 --> 33:03.290
Six hours alone with you?

33:07.331 --> 33:09.799
But it didn't turn out
the way that I thought.

33:12.836 --> 33:15.930
You opened up to me.

33:16.039 --> 33:18.906
I... I kind of got to know you.

33:18.942 --> 33:21.809
Wesley, it's my fault
that you're here.

33:21.845 --> 33:24.245
I shouldn't have asked you.

33:24.281 --> 33:27.341
Sir, I'm honored
that you wanted me along.

33:27.384 --> 33:28.476
I was selfish.

33:28.519 --> 33:32.956
I thought I...
wouldn't see you again.

33:33.056 --> 33:34.387
I'm sorry.

33:35.926 --> 33:37.587
Sir

33:37.628 --> 33:43.464
in the past three years,
I've lived more

33:43.500 --> 33:46.401
than most people do
in a lifetime.

33:49.406 --> 33:55.777
I think I'm very lucky,
no matter what happens.

33:55.813 --> 34:00.477
How many people get to serve
with Jean-Luc Picard?

34:05.355 --> 34:06.481
Sir...

34:09.159 --> 34:12.185
You don't know this...

34:12.228 --> 34:17.826
no one knows this,
because I've never told anyone.

34:21.405 --> 34:25.136
All of the things
that I've worked for...

34:25.175 --> 34:31.478
school, my science projects...

34:31.514 --> 34:33.847
getting into the Academy...

34:37.987 --> 34:41.583
I've done it all because
I want you to be proud of me.

34:49.199 --> 34:53.192
If there is one thing
that I've learned from you

34:53.237 --> 34:57.936
it's that you don't quit,
and I'm not going to quit now.

34:57.975 --> 34:59.704
I've seen you think yourself

34:59.743 --> 35:01.734
out of worse
situations than this

35:01.778 --> 35:03.769
and I'm going to think us
out of this.

35:09.786 --> 35:12.482
You're not going to die.

35:12.522 --> 35:16.618
I'm not going to let you die.

35:16.660 --> 35:20.152
I'll get to the water

35:20.197 --> 35:24.691
and I'll keep you alive
until they find us.

35:24.735 --> 35:26.259
I promise.

35:36.592 --> 35:39.152
First Officer's Log,
supplemental.

35:39.195 --> 35:42.426
The <i>Enterprise</i> is returning
to the last known location

35:42.464 --> 35:43.988
of the missing shuttlecraft.

35:44.033 --> 35:45.125
Are you certain?

35:45.167 --> 35:46.191
It is definitely debris.

35:46.235 --> 35:48.396
The primary material is duranium

35:48.437 --> 35:52.066
with smaller proportions
of sonodamite and ermanium.

35:52.107 --> 35:54.200
Most shuttlecraft hulls
are made of duranium.

35:54.243 --> 35:55.608
Then, they're gone.

35:55.644 --> 35:56.872
Not necessarily, Doctor.

35:56.912 --> 35:58.345
There is far too little debris

35:58.380 --> 36:00.177
to account
for an entire shuttlecraft.

36:00.216 --> 36:01.183
So what is it?

36:01.217 --> 36:02.241
You know, Dirgo had

36:02.284 --> 36:03.979
his maneuvering thrusters
rigged a funny way.

36:04.019 --> 36:05.145
Claimed it was more efficient.

36:05.187 --> 36:06.245
If one of them blew

36:06.288 --> 36:07.983
it might have left debris
that looks like this.

36:08.023 --> 36:09.684
If only one
of his thrusters was out

36:09.725 --> 36:11.590
he still could have
set down somewhere.

36:11.627 --> 36:15.654
The only Class-M planets in the
system are Pentarus II and V.

36:15.698 --> 36:16.858
Both of which have been

36:16.932 --> 36:18.661
thoroughly searched
by the miners.

36:18.701 --> 36:20.225
Then we'll search them again.

36:20.269 --> 36:21.634
Sir, there are also four moons

36:21.670 --> 36:23.865
in the Pentarus system
that could support life.

36:23.906 --> 36:25.464
Have the miners searched them?

36:25.507 --> 36:26.872
Not yet, sir.

36:26.942 --> 36:29.638
Which one is closest
to the debris coordinates?

36:29.678 --> 36:33.079
Lambda Paz, one of the moons
of Pentarus III.

36:33.115 --> 36:35.276
Set a course, Ensign.

37:00.943 --> 37:05.243
Ensign, where are we?

37:11.420 --> 37:14.048
We crashed, sir.

37:14.089 --> 37:16.717
We're in a cave.

37:16.759 --> 37:19.250
Need water.

37:22.398 --> 37:25.333
Sir, we don't have any water.

37:25.367 --> 37:27.358
Don't you remember?

37:27.403 --> 37:31.100
We tried to get to the fountain
and Captain Dirgo...

37:33.442 --> 37:37.276
Yes... I remember.

37:37.313 --> 37:39.577
I think I'm onto something.

37:39.615 --> 37:43.176
I've analyzed
the sentry's energy patterns.

37:43.218 --> 37:47.086
Wesley, I may not make it.

37:47.122 --> 37:48.885
I've taken
the transponder element

37:48.991 --> 37:50.117
from my communicator

37:50.159 --> 37:52.354
and I've used it
to modify my tricorder.

37:52.394 --> 37:53.361
No. No, Wesley...

37:53.395 --> 37:54.589
I think I can use it
to interrupt

37:54.630 --> 37:55.824
the sentry's electrical pattern.

37:55.864 --> 37:56.831
Listen...

37:56.865 --> 37:58.355
Stop it, maybe slow it down.

37:58.400 --> 37:59.594
Listen to me.

38:01.737 --> 38:03.295
Yes, sir.

38:06.075 --> 38:09.738
There's so much
I wanted to tell you.

38:12.081 --> 38:14.049
The Academy...

38:14.083 --> 38:17.541
there's someone...

38:17.586 --> 38:21.522
someone who meant
a great deal to me.

38:21.557 --> 38:26.859
He's been there for...
oh, forever.

38:26.929 --> 38:30.558
Someone you must get to know.

38:30.599 --> 38:33.067
His name is Boothby.

38:33.102 --> 38:38.768
Now, you tell him
that you and I were friends.

38:38.807 --> 38:43.335
When I was there, he...
he helped me.

38:43.379 --> 38:45.210
Listen to him.

38:45.247 --> 38:47.807
What does he teach?

38:47.850 --> 38:51.217
He's the groundskeeper.

38:51.253 --> 38:54.484
He's one of the wisest men
I ever knew.

38:57.559 --> 39:02.394
Oh, I envy you, Wesley Crusher.

39:08.237 --> 39:11.035
You're just at the beginning
of the adventure.

39:17.579 --> 39:20.047
Go on.

39:20.082 --> 39:22.744
Get the water, stay alive.

39:24.753 --> 39:26.414
They'll find you.

39:37.099 --> 39:39.727
I'll be back soon.

39:39.768 --> 39:41.429
Of course.

39:53.115 --> 39:54.582
Wesley.

40:01.457 --> 40:03.448
You remember...

40:06.462 --> 40:09.454
I was always proud of you.

41:42.652 --> 41:44.745
It worked!

41:56.766 --> 41:58.097
Captain?

42:00.103 --> 42:03.595
Captain Picard, wake up.

42:07.811 --> 42:09.802
Captain?

42:36.306 --> 42:38.399
Wesley?

42:40.810 --> 42:42.835
Wesley?

42:44.080 --> 42:45.741
Wesley?

42:52.922 --> 42:55.152
Mom?

43:00.096 --> 43:01.290
Yes.

43:01.331 --> 43:03.595
Oh, Mom.

43:10.273 --> 43:12.764
Wesley, thank God.

43:17.781 --> 43:20.944
I'm so happy to see you.

43:24.454 --> 43:25.751
You're okay.

43:25.789 --> 43:26.778
Come on.

43:28.124 --> 43:30.092
How did you find us?

43:30.126 --> 43:31.753
We found the wreckage

43:31.795 --> 43:34.423
and the arrow which
indicated your direction.

43:34.464 --> 43:37.092
We'll take Wesley
by stretcher, as well.

43:37.133 --> 43:39.465
No. I can walk.

43:42.138 --> 43:43.730
Doctor?

43:45.575 --> 43:48.510
We're taking you back
to the <i>Enterprise. </i>

43:48.545 --> 43:51.036
We've stabilized
your vital signs.

43:51.080 --> 43:54.447
All right, let's go now.

43:54.484 --> 43:56.042
One moment.

43:56.085 --> 43:57.848
Mr. Crusher?

43:57.887 --> 43:59.184
Yes, sir?

43:59.222 --> 44:03.249
What are you doing
in such a filthy uniform?

44:06.262 --> 44:09.789
You don't look
so ship-shape yourself, sir.

44:13.937 --> 44:19.151
Wesley, you will be missed.
