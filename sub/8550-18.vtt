13:11.258 --> 13:13.093
I THOUGHT
HE RESPECTED ME TOO.

13:13.160 --> 13:14.494
BUT WHEN I TOLD
HIM TO SLOW DOWN,

13:14.561 --> 13:16.629
HE JUST CALLED ME A BABY.

13:16.696 --> 13:18.598
MAX, STOP,
YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS.

13:18.665 --> 13:21.568
I'M NOT.
I'M YOUR BEST FRIEND.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.871
WELL, THEN ACT LIKE IT
AND BE HAPPY FOR ME.

13:26.473 --> 13:27.340
HOW CAN I BE HAPPY

13:27.407 --> 13:30.010
WHEN I KNOW
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN?

13:30.077 --> 13:32.212
DANIEL WALLACE
IS A CREEP, LAURA,

13:32.279 --> 13:34.948
AND HE'S GOING
TO BREAK YOUR HEART.

13:35.015 --> 13:37.918
NO, MAX,
HE BROKE YOUR HEART.

13:37.985 --> 13:40.020
DANIEL AND I
ARE DOING JUST FINE.

13:53.433 --> 13:55.668
OH, HI, MAXINE.

13:55.735 --> 13:57.871
HELLO, MR. WINSLOW.

13:57.938 --> 13:59.672
MAXINE?

13:59.739 --> 14:01.408
ARE YOU OKAY?

14:01.474 --> 14:05.645
NOT REALLY. LAURA AND I
JUST HAD A FIGHT.

14:05.712 --> 14:08.181
OH.

14:08.248 --> 14:09.416
ABOUT WHAT?

14:09.482 --> 14:10.951
DANIEL WALLACE.

14:11.018 --> 14:13.353
MMM, YOU LIKE HIM, TOO.

14:13.420 --> 14:14.754
THAT CREEPY JERK?

14:14.821 --> 14:16.023
MAYBE YOU DON'T.

14:18.125 --> 14:19.392
MR. WINSLOW.
MMM?

14:19.459 --> 14:21.761
DANIEL SWEET-TALKS GIRLS
INTO FALLING FOR HIM.

14:21.828 --> 14:24.464
AND THEN, IF HE DOESN'T GET
WHAT HE WANTS, HE DUMPS THEM.

14:28.168 --> 14:30.237
WELL, J-JUST--
JUST WHAT IS IT

14:30.303 --> 14:32.072
THAT--THAT--THAT
HE WANTS?

14:37.244 --> 14:38.311
YOU KNOW.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.316
I'LL KILL HIM!

14:43.383 --> 14:44.484
I WILL KILL HIM!

14:57.897 --> 14:59.066
I WILL KILL HIM.

15:01.668 --> 15:02.635
OOH!

15:09.209 --> 15:09.909
STEVE?

15:09.977 --> 15:12.512
GREETINGS,
BROTHER BIG GUY.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.147
I CAME TO SAY GOODBYE.

15:14.214 --> 15:15.548
I'VE JOINED A MONASTERY,

15:15.615 --> 15:19.586
THE BROTHERHOOD
OF PERPETUAL
PATIENCE AND PRAYER,

15:19.652 --> 15:21.821
GOOD OLD P, P, & P.

15:21.888 --> 15:23.656
IS THIS A VACATION,

15:23.723 --> 15:26.960
A LITTLE R & R
AT P, P, & P?

15:27.027 --> 15:28.595
NO, I'M GOING
THERE TO LIVE.

15:28.661 --> 15:31.831
I'VE TAKEN
A VOW OF CHASTITY.

15:31.898 --> 15:33.566
OH, STEVE.
YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN CHASTE.

15:36.003 --> 15:37.604
YEAH, BUT NOW
I HAVE AN EXCUSE.

15:40.173 --> 15:42.375
DOES THIS HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH LAURA?

15:42.442 --> 15:45.345
AH!
YOU CAN'T PULL THE WOOL
OVER YOUR EYES, MY SON.

15:47.347 --> 15:50.583
MY LOVELY LAURA
HAS FOUND ANOTHER MAN,

15:50.650 --> 15:53.320
AND THE ONLY THING THAT
CAN MEND MY BROKEN HEART

15:53.386 --> 15:56.489
ARE SEVERAL YEARS OF PRAYER
AND MAKING CHEESE.

16:05.832 --> 16:07.567
HEY, THIS IS NICE.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.369
I LIKE YOUR BEDROOM.

16:09.436 --> 16:13.740
WELL, I DON'T REALLY
CALL IT A...BEDROOM.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.343
IT'S JUST A ROOM.

16:16.409 --> 16:17.710
SURE, THERE HAPPENS
TO BE A BED IN IT,

16:17.777 --> 16:19.012
BUT THAT'S JUST
A COINCIDENCE.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.315
WHY ARE YOU
SO NERVOUS, LAURA?

16:23.716 --> 16:25.752
DANIEL...

16:25.818 --> 16:27.587
WHEN WE WERE
DOWN ON THE GROUND,

16:27.654 --> 16:30.557
THE IDEA OF COMING UP
HERE TO TALK SEEMED
LIKE A GOOD IDEA,

16:30.623 --> 16:33.093
BUT NOW THAT WE'RE
HERE, I THINK
IT'S A HUGE MISTAKE,

16:33.160 --> 16:35.195
SO LET'S GO, OKAY?

16:35.262 --> 16:37.097
LAURA, LAURA, RELAX.

16:39.499 --> 16:40.500
JUST RELAX, OKAY?

16:43.370 --> 16:45.705
DANIEL, IF MY FATHER
CATCHES YOU IN HERE,

16:45.772 --> 16:48.007
HE'LL DRIBBLE YOU HOME,

16:48.075 --> 16:49.676
AND I DON'T EVEN
WANT TO THINK ABOUT

16:49.742 --> 16:51.444
WHAT HE'LL DO TO ME.

16:51.511 --> 16:54.747
LOOK. IF IT MAKES YOU
THAT UNCOMFORTABLE,

16:54.814 --> 16:56.015
I'LL JUST LEAVE, OKAY?

16:57.750 --> 16:59.086
YOU WON'T BE MAD?

16:59.152 --> 17:00.787
OF COURSE NOT.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.089
I JUST WANT YOU
TO BE HAPPY.

17:04.124 --> 17:05.792
DID YOU HAVE
A GOOD TIME TONIGHT?

17:05.858 --> 17:07.927
TERRIFIC.

17:07.994 --> 17:09.162
GOOD.

17:20.440 --> 17:21.674
WHAT'S--
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

17:23.376 --> 17:25.745
NOTHING. I JUST THINK
YOU SHOULD GO NOW.

17:25.812 --> 17:27.247
OH, COME ON. LOOSEN UP.

17:29.616 --> 17:31.084
DANIEL, NO.

17:31.151 --> 17:33.286
NO? WHAT
DO YOU MEAN, NO?

17:35.222 --> 17:36.356
I THOUGHT YOU LIKED ME.

17:36.423 --> 17:38.191
I DO. THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE STILL STANDING.

17:40.993 --> 17:43.896
LAURA, YOU'RE
ACTING LIKE A BABY.

17:43.963 --> 17:45.465
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

17:45.532 --> 17:48.368
LOOK. I'M A MAN,
AND I HAVE NEEDS.

17:51.238 --> 17:52.205
NOW ARE YOU GOING
TO ACT LIKE A BABY

17:52.272 --> 17:53.540
OR A MATURE WOMAN?

17:57.410 --> 18:00.012
MAXINE TRIED TO WARN ME,
BUT I WOULDN'T LISTEN.

18:00.079 --> 18:02.849
WHAT?

18:02.915 --> 18:04.784
GET OUT.

18:04.851 --> 18:06.052
LAURA--

18:06.119 --> 18:09.789
GET OUT. I DON'T EVER
WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

18:09.856 --> 18:11.124
ALRIGHT, FINE.

18:11.191 --> 18:13.460
OKAY, I'M OUT OF HERE,

18:13.526 --> 18:15.695
BUT LOOK,
CATCH THIS, BABY.

18:15.762 --> 18:18.198
THERE ARE LOT OF GIRLS
OUT THERE WHO WOULD
LOVE TO BE WITH ME.

18:18.265 --> 18:19.466
THIS IS YOUR LOSS.

18:22.235 --> 18:24.437
DANIEL, WAIT.

18:24.504 --> 18:25.505
YEAH?

18:29.342 --> 18:30.577
CATCH THIS, BABY.

18:32.011 --> 18:33.313
AAH!

18:44.524 --> 18:47.394
LAURA, WHAT'S GOING ON?
I HEARD A NOISE.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.729
I JUST HAD A FIGHT
WITH DANIEL WALLACE.

18:49.796 --> 18:50.997
WAIT A MINUTE.

18:51.063 --> 18:52.399
WAS HE UP HERE
IN YOUR ROOM?

18:54.334 --> 18:57.470
YES, BUT I SENT
HIM HOME...AIRMAIL.

18:59.339 --> 19:01.408
HE SHOULDN'T
HAVE BEEN UP HERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

19:01.474 --> 19:04.411
I KNOW, MOM,
AND I'M SORRY.

19:04.477 --> 19:05.745
HE SAID HE JUST WANTED
TO COME UP HERE

19:05.812 --> 19:07.547
SO WE COULD TALK.

19:07.614 --> 19:09.316
BUT HE REALLY
WANTED TO MAKE OUT.

19:12.519 --> 19:13.786
HE KEPT PRESSURING ME, MOM.

19:16.055 --> 19:17.757
HOW DID YOU HANDLE IT?

19:17.824 --> 19:18.858
I MADE HIM LEAVE

19:18.925 --> 19:21.528
AND I TOLD HIM I NEVER
WANTED TO SEE HIM AGAIN.

19:21.594 --> 19:23.496
WELL, YOU DID
THE RIGHT THING.

19:28.535 --> 19:31.238
THEN WHY DO
I FEEL SO BAD, MOM?

19:31.304 --> 19:32.539
COME HERE, SWEETHEART.

19:35.942 --> 19:37.210
HE SAID I WAS SPECIAL.

19:39.246 --> 19:40.647
HE MADE ME TRUST HIM,

19:43.416 --> 19:44.517
BUT HE WAS JUST LYING

19:44.584 --> 19:46.185
SO HE COULD GET
WHAT HE WANTED.

19:47.954 --> 19:50.056
I KNOW, I KNOW,

19:50.122 --> 19:51.724
BUT, YOU KNOW, LAURA,

19:51.791 --> 19:54.294
SOMEDAY YOU'RE GOING
TO MEET THE RIGHT GUY.

19:54.361 --> 19:56.429
AND HE'LL MAKE
YOU FEEL SPECIAL,

19:56.496 --> 19:58.465
AND HE WON'T BE LYING.

19:58.531 --> 19:59.899
HE'LL REALLY LOVE YOU,

19:59.966 --> 20:01.768
AND YOU'LL
REALLY LOVE HIM.

20:01.834 --> 20:03.936
AND THEN YOU KNOW
WHAT WILL HAPPEN?

20:04.003 --> 20:05.137
WE'LL HAVE SEX?

20:05.204 --> 20:06.473
NO!

20:10.910 --> 20:11.911
YOU'LL GET MARRIED.

20:13.313 --> 20:15.147
OH, WELL, WELL, SURE.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.950
THAT--THAT...
THAT GOES WITHOUT SAYING.

20:18.017 --> 20:18.985
WELL, SAY IT.

20:21.153 --> 20:22.221
I LIKE
TO HEAR THOSE WORDS.

20:22.289 --> 20:24.757
I'M YOUR MOTHER.

20:24.824 --> 20:26.726
WE'LL GET MARRIED FIRST.

20:26.793 --> 20:27.760
THANK YOU.

20:32.299 --> 20:34.701
[STEVE]
LAURA,
WHERE'S WALLACE?

20:34.767 --> 20:37.036
I TOLD DANIEL
I NEVER WANT TO SEE HIM.

20:37.103 --> 20:40.172
YES!
YES!

20:40.239 --> 20:41.374
NOW, LAURA,

20:41.441 --> 20:43.543
YOU'RE--
YOU'RE VULNERABLE NOW.

20:43.610 --> 20:46.178
YOUR EMOTIONS ARE
EXPOSED AND HURTING.

20:46.245 --> 20:49.349
AND , WELL, I'M NOT
TOO PROUD
TO TRY AND GET YOU

20:49.416 --> 20:51.518
ON THE REBOUND.

20:51.584 --> 20:54.086
SO WHY DON'T YOU AND I
JOIN HANDS

20:54.153 --> 20:57.123
AND GLIDE UP
THE ESCALATOR OF LIFE?

20:57.189 --> 20:58.391
SORRY.

21:00.159 --> 21:01.961
BUT I'LL TELL
YOU WHAT I'LL DO.

21:02.028 --> 21:03.830
WELL, WHAT'S THAT?

21:03.896 --> 21:07.367
WELL, IN A FEW SECONDS
IT'LL BE MIDNIGHT,

21:07.434 --> 21:11.103
SO...I'LL LET
YOU BE MY VALENTINE

21:11.170 --> 21:13.773
FOR THE REST OF THE DAY.

21:13.840 --> 21:16.108
OH! OH! OH! OH! OH!

21:16.175 --> 21:18.545
YOU HEARD HER!
YOU HEARD HER!

21:18.611 --> 21:21.013
YOU'RE MY WITNESSES!
YOU'RE MY WIT--

21:21.080 --> 21:22.715
OH! OH! OH!

21:22.782 --> 21:26.185
AAH...
5...

21:26.252 --> 21:29.822
4...
OH!

21:29.889 --> 21:32.859
3...
AHH.

21:32.925 --> 21:35.362
2...

21:35.428 --> 21:39.065
1...
OO-OO-OOH!

21:39.131 --> 21:39.966

21:40.032 --> 21:42.034
AHH...

21:42.101 --> 21:43.970
OHH...OHH...OHH...

21:52.311 --> 21:53.813
THANKS FOR
