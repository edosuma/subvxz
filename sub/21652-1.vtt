07:56.800 --> 07:58.848
everything
that's happened to you

07:58.920 --> 08:02.367

to be beyond certain

took place,

20:38.000 --> 20:39.684

21:15.800 --> 21:18.724
Yes, but he must've left behind
extensive notes, plans...

21:18.800 --> 21:21.246
You know how secretive
and protective he was.

21:21.320 --> 21:23.641
That's why he demanded using
actual glass for the memories

21:23.760 --> 21:25.808
instead of storing them
on a closed cloud server.

21:25.880 --> 21:28.247
We're in his network,
but all his data is encrypted,

21:28.320 --> 21:29.606
and sophisticatedly so.

21:29.680 --> 21:31.489
I mean, it's actually
quite brilliant...

21:31.600 --> 21:35.685
Are you telling me
that we can't reverse engineer

21:35.760 --> 21:38.001
the product
that we engineered?

21:38.080 --> 21:40.970
Not without Gordon's prototype,
at least not for some time.

21:43.280 --> 21:45.886
Define "some time."

21:45.960 --> 21:49.009
A year? Optimistically.

21:53.600 --> 21:57.730
Well.
Well, it can't just be lost.

22:04.080 --> 22:06.287
Let us know if there's
anything we can do.

22:06.360 --> 22:08.203
Thank you. Bye.

22:31.160 --> 22:32.491
<i>I'm testing you.</i>

22:32.560 --> 22:34.961
<i>- I don't think you remember.
- The sea lion.</i>

22:35.080 --> 22:37.526
<i>Yes, yes!</i>

22:37.600 --> 22:39.011
Weeks after we showed them,

22:39.080 --> 22:41.686
we showed them numbers
and symbols on the cards,

22:41.760 --> 22:43.171
and then weeks after,

22:43.240 --> 22:45.607
they could correctly identify
the matching cards.

22:45.680 --> 22:49.162
That's amazing. Their brains
are a quarter the size of ours.

22:49.240 --> 22:51.891
Mm. So that alone is
advanced cognitive function,

22:51.960 --> 22:54.725
but you know what was
really incredible?

22:54.800 --> 22:56.290
Hmm, what?

22:56.360 --> 22:59.045
They could remember
the whole thing ten years later.

22:59.120 --> 23:00.963
People can't even do that.

23:01.040 --> 23:02.849
Some people in particular!

23:18.280 --> 23:20.089
- Hi.
- Hello.

23:20.680 --> 23:22.603
- Hi.
- Um. Sorry.

23:22.680 --> 23:25.490
I'm James Klinch.
I'm here for the reception.

23:25.560 --> 23:27.927
Yes, I'm sorry,
I sent everyone away.

23:28.000 --> 23:32.927
I just, I couldn't take any more
mindless platitudes. I'm sorry.

23:33.000 --> 23:34.331
Thanks for coming.

23:53.480 --> 23:55.482
Time heals all wounds.

23:55.560 --> 23:59.326
Uh... that's
a really bad joke.

23:59.400 --> 24:01.084
The platitudes...

24:01.160 --> 24:03.401
it's quite cheeky
under the circumstances, yeah.

24:03.480 --> 24:07.121
I know you want to be alone,
but I just wanted to say

24:07.200 --> 24:10.124
how truly sorry
I am. Truly.

24:10.200 --> 24:11.201
Thank you.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.525
How did you know Gordon?

24:17.120 --> 24:18.565
He saved my life.

24:21.120 --> 24:23.441
Now, that's a story
I'd like to hear.

24:25.680 --> 24:26.806
Thank you.

24:32.600 --> 24:33.886
You can help me
clean up.

24:43.640 --> 24:47.247
<i>We happened to be staying
at the same hotel one night.</i>

24:47.560 --> 24:51.963
He was there for a conference,
and I was there...

24:52.040 --> 24:56.011
because my life
hadn't worked out,

24:56.080 --> 24:58.845
not the way I imagined,
and I was in a bad place.

25:00.800 --> 25:03.770
And the hotel was
a very tall building.

25:06.720 --> 25:09.087
There was a terrible storm
that night,

25:09.160 --> 25:10.605
but it was strangely warm.

25:10.680 --> 25:12.489
It felt like a hurricane
was coming.

25:14.320 --> 25:16.846
I couldn't sleep,
so I went down to the hotel bar.

25:16.920 --> 25:18.729
It was a typical hotel bar,

25:18.800 --> 25:20.450
which is to say

25:20.520 --> 25:23.205
it's really the only thing
I can remember about it.

25:24.320 --> 25:27.164
But Gordon was sitting there,
having a nightcap.

25:29.080 --> 25:30.889
He seemed lost in thought.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.844
I was... drowning in mine.

25:37.240 --> 25:39.925
After a few moments,
he turns to me and he says,

25:40.000 --> 25:41.764
"This night can go one
of two ways.

25:41.840 --> 25:45.049
Either we can sit here drinking
alone with our thoughts,

25:45.120 --> 25:46.849
or we can make something
out of it."

25:48.400 --> 25:51.483
He smiled and ordered
a bottle of whiskey.

25:52.520 --> 25:53.646
This whiskey.

25:56.240 --> 25:58.527
And we talked
about everything under the sun.

25:58.600 --> 25:59.726
I mean everything.

26:01.640 --> 26:03.881
Our whole life story.

26:07.240 --> 26:09.720
I told him things
I had never told anyone before.

26:11.160 --> 26:14.369
I don't know, maybe it was
the storm or the booze, or...

26:14.440 --> 26:18.570
something, it just felt like
the last night of the world.

26:18.680 --> 26:21.411
We had so much to drink
that we go up to the roof

26:21.480 --> 26:25.405
with the idea that we'll make it
until the sun comes up,

26:25.520 --> 26:28.922
and we go out there
in the middle of this storm.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.889
I mean, the wind
is blowing hard.

26:30.960 --> 26:35.488
I remember thinking just how
powerful wind could actually be.

26:37.240 --> 26:41.211
<i>Against the storm, my problems,
they seemed so trivial.</i>

26:43.600 --> 26:47.002
We tried to get back inside,
but the door was locked,

26:47.080 --> 26:50.209
so we were stuck out there
all night.

26:50.280 --> 26:55.286
I woke up the next morning
and somehow I knew I'd be okay,

26:55.360 --> 26:57.044
that I'd live.

27:01.400 --> 27:03.801
Surviving that storm,
it saved me.

27:06.920 --> 27:08.490
If Gordon could
still love life

27:08.560 --> 27:10.324
after everything
he'd been through,

27:10.440 --> 27:11.726
how could I not?

27:15.120 --> 27:16.929
He never told
me that story.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.650
I've never told
anyone that story.

27:20.760 --> 27:22.444
We stayed in touch
a few times...

27:23.280 --> 27:26.602
but really our friendship
was meant for one night.

27:29.440 --> 27:30.771
I'm a little bit jealous.

27:30.840 --> 27:32.330
It makes me feel like
I didn't know him anymore...

27:33.320 --> 27:35.891
not since our daughter...

27:38.680 --> 27:40.364
I guess maybe
I didn't for a long time.

27:42.280 --> 27:43.725
You can convince
yourself that you do,

27:43.800 --> 27:47.691
but then a complete stranger
shows up, tells you a story...

27:50.360 --> 27:52.806
...then you realize, God, I
didn't even scratch the surface.

27:52.880 --> 27:54.325
Yeah, I see, I'm sorry.
I didn't...

27:54.440 --> 27:57.649
No, I'm... I'm really glad
that you did.

28:02.320 --> 28:04.402
Do you remember
the last conversation you had?

28:06.880 --> 28:08.609
Mm, I wish I didn't.

28:11.480 --> 28:13.005
I lost my brother.

28:14.480 --> 28:15.527
Long time ago.

28:16.640 --> 28:17.880
I'm sorry.

28:19.880 --> 28:21.530
I was there when he died.

28:23.400 --> 28:25.050
He said something to me,

28:25.120 --> 28:28.408
but I can't remember
what he said.

28:29.920 --> 28:32.924
I can remember every detail
of that night,

28:33.000 --> 28:35.048
except the last words
he said to me.

28:36.160 --> 28:39.323
it's funny how important
the details become.

28:42.360 --> 28:44.761
I haven't even been able to go
into Gordon's office yet.

28:45.320 --> 28:46.970
Everyone wants to get
their hands

28:47.040 --> 28:49.202
on his papers and his journals,

28:49.280 --> 28:51.851
and, frankly, it just seems
easier

28:51.920 --> 28:52.967
to just shut the world out.

28:53.040 --> 28:55.611
And all everyone wants
to talk about is his work,

28:55.680 --> 28:58.490
as if that's
the most important thing.

28:58.560 --> 29:01.530
it's not about his family
or his life

29:01.600 --> 29:04.490
or memories that he
created,

29:04.560 --> 29:07.291
and it feels like they don't
really care about him.

29:10.000 --> 29:12.321
I mean, he was found dead
in his office

29:12.400 --> 29:13.890
with gunshots in the walls,

29:13.960 --> 29:15.962
and it's...

29:18.080 --> 29:19.525
Gunshots?

29:21.360 --> 29:23.283
Yeah, there's
an investigation.

29:23.920 --> 29:27.686
l-l thought it was an aneurysm.
The papers said...

29:27.760 --> 29:32.482
His office was ransacked,
and, God knows, it's confusing.

29:32.560 --> 29:34.403
Do they know
who could've done that?

29:34.480 --> 29:37.723
He was working with a lot
of troubled people.

29:37.800 --> 29:39.529
I know that he was
having difficulties

29:39.600 --> 29:42.171
with some of the participants
of the research study.

29:42.240 --> 29:43.890
Have they found
anything yet?

29:44.640 --> 29:46.085
I think we just
had the funeral

29:46.160 --> 29:49.448
for the only person at Cortex
that could find anything.

29:51.280 --> 29:53.089
You think they're
hiding something?

29:53.160 --> 29:55.208
There's a part of me
that just thinks I just...

29:55.280 --> 29:57.203
I'm never gonna know
the real truth,

29:57.280 --> 29:59.248
and I didn't get
to say goodbye.

30:03.760 --> 30:06.491
I just... sorry.

30:07.320 --> 30:09.607
I wish that I could've
been with him.

30:10.560 --> 30:12.688
Oh, God.

30:14.920 --> 30:15.921
Sorry, guh...

30:16.040 --> 30:17.326
it's okay.

30:17.400 --> 30:19.050
So stupid, I...

30:19.120 --> 30:20.246
I, no...

30:20.320 --> 30:23.324
I completely lost it this
morning because I was trying

30:23.400 --> 30:25.926
to get the coffee machine
to work, and I couldn't...

30:27.760 --> 30:31.207
and Gordon, he just,
he made the best coffee.

30:31.280 --> 30:33.408
You know, if I don't have coffee
in the morning,

30:33.480 --> 30:36.051
I will cry like a baby.

30:36.120 --> 30:40.284
I cry at everything, I do.
Won't stop crying.

30:44.720 --> 30:45.846
Oh...

30:47.920 --> 30:53.802
James, would you mind awfully
telling me the story again?

30:53.880 --> 30:57.043
Oh, uh, sure.

31:00.240 --> 31:01.241
Cheers.

31:05.520 --> 31:07.921
It was a dark
and stormy night...

31:09.840 --> 31:11.444
Thank you, James.

31:11.520 --> 31:14.364
That was unexpected.

31:16.360 --> 31:18.522
I hope you'll visit again.

31:18.600 --> 31:20.364
I'm happy to.

31:20.480 --> 31:21.481
Bye.

32:20.280 --> 32:22.851
Pure, unfiltered truth.

32:58.560 --> 33:01.689
<i>With the technology
of the Rememory machine,</i>

33:01.760 --> 33:06.527
a <i>pure memory is recorded
onto</i> a <i>memory glass...</i>

33:07.440 --> 33:09.169
<i>objectively copied
from the brain</i>

33:09.240 --> 33:10.890
<i>and able to be displayed</i>

33:10.960 --> 33:13.406
<i>before the patient
and anyone else.</i>

33:13.480 --> 33:15.926
<i>By re-experiencing
the memory,</i>

33:16.000 --> 33:19.004
<i>a catharsis is created
for the patient</i>

33:19.080 --> 33:22.402
<i>that would be impossible to
achieve by simply recalling,</i>

33:22.520 --> 33:24.648
a <i>sort of theater
of memory,</i>

33:24.720 --> 33:28.122
<i>in which the patient
becomes audience</i>

33:28.200 --> 33:30.328
<i>to the truth
of their lives.</i>

33:38.920 --> 33:43.164
<i>In the recording of a memory,</i>

33:43.240 --> 33:46.722
<i>the role of the psychologist
or therapist is crucial.</i>

33:46.800 --> 33:50.885
<i>The patient must be guided
to the memory to be recorded</i>

33:50.960 --> 33:52.883
<i>to activate
that part of the brain,</i>

33:52.960 --> 33:55.611
<i>even if it cannot
be remembered consciously.</i>

33:55.720 --> 33:58.405
<i>The machine has the potential
not only to access,</i>

33:58.480 --> 34:02.371
<i>but also to alter the brain's
synaptic pathways,</i>

34:02.440 --> 34:04.204
<i>so there is the risk
that memories</i>

34:04.280 --> 34:08.251
<i>can be corrupted, altered,
and jumbled.</i>

34:08.320 --> 34:10.083
<i>While it's
theoretically possible</i>

34:10.159 --> 34:12.811
<i>to constructively reset
or delete selected memories,</i>

34:12.880 --> 34:15.610
<i>at this time the risks
are unknown.</i>

35:09.080 --> 35:10.525
<i>Happy birth...</i>

35:12.360 --> 35:14.408
<i>Sam, honey, come on!</i>

35:26.440 --> 35:27.930
<i>Help me!</i>

35:49.800 --> 35:51.404
<i>Ah, it's good to be home,
brother.</i>

35:51.480 --> 35:53.482
<i>Ah, good to have you
back, brother.</i>

35:53.560 --> 35:54.561
<i>Yeah!</i>

35:58.200 --> 35:59.850
I'm driving.

35:59.920 --> 36:02.321
No, no, no, no,
this is my sweet ride.

36:02.400 --> 36:04.402
Yeah, and I'm driving
your sweet ride.

36:04.480 --> 36:07.689
Okay. You're driving me...

36:29.040 --> 36:30.883
Other than the routine
security officers,

36:31.000 --> 36:32.411
janitors,
and maintenance crew,

36:32.480 --> 36:35.211
only three people came
into Cortex after 11 p.m.

36:35.280 --> 36:36.964
using limited-access
swipe cards.

36:37.040 --> 36:38.565
However, none
of them appear

36:38.640 --> 36:40.847
with the device
on any of our cameras.

36:40.920 --> 36:41.967
These two we've identified

36:42.040 --> 36:43.565
as participants in Gordon's
trial group,

36:43.680 --> 36:45.967
and that... that's Neil.

36:46.040 --> 36:47.371
Why would Gordon
be meeting

36:47.440 --> 36:49.363
trial group members
here so late?

36:49.440 --> 36:51.090
- Rather out of the ordinary.
- That I don't know.

36:51.160 --> 36:53.003
But they arrived
within minutes of one another,

36:53.080 --> 36:54.844
so it could be
a scheduled meeting.

36:55.560 --> 36:58.211
Question all staff and crew
members working that night,

36:58.280 --> 37:00.169
and then visit
all trial group members.

37:00.280 --> 37:02.089
But be smart about it.

37:02.160 --> 37:04.128
We can't let it get out
that we don't have the machine.

37:05.480 --> 37:07.164
Uh, there's one other thing.

37:09.880 --> 37:11.530
This guy. He never came in,

37:11.600 --> 37:14.331
but he sat in the parking lot
for nearly 25 minutes.

37:14.400 --> 37:16.004
- Who is he?
- We don't know yet.

37:17.640 --> 37:18.641
Find out.

37:37.000 --> 37:39.571
I need to find out
what happened to you, Gordon.

37:39.640 --> 37:41.802
it's the least I can do.

37:42.800 --> 37:45.644
Maybe I can't see your memories,

37:45.720 --> 37:51.727
but I can see the memories
of those near you when you died.

38:13.040 --> 38:15.202
<i>You like staying at Grandma
and Grandpa's?</i>

38:16.000 --> 38:17.240
<i>It's okay.</i>

38:17.320 --> 38:19.288
<i>They love having you.</i>

38:21.080 --> 38:23.162
<i>You're lucky
that you have grandparents</i>

38:23.240 --> 38:25.129
<i>and you're able to see them.</i>

38:25.240 --> 38:27.891
<i>There's lots of kids wish they
still had grandparents.</i>

38:27.960 --> 38:29.610
<i>But I want
to stay with you.</i>

38:31.800 --> 38:32.801
<i>Mom.</i>

38:32.880 --> 38:34.166
<i>No.</i>

38:34.240 --> 38:35.241
<i>Mama!</i>

38:52.200 --> 38:54.806
Okay, Gordon,
let's meet your group.

39:02.040 --> 39:04.520
Stay with me, come on!

39:04.600 --> 39:07.126
I want to help you get back
to the truth of that event.

39:07.240 --> 39:08.321
Go!

39:24.760 --> 39:28.128
Can you tell me a memory
that fills you with self-hate?

39:41.920 --> 39:45.811
When you keep this secret,
do you feel shame?

39:55.960 --> 39:58.247
<i>Mom? Mommy!</i>

39:58.320 --> 40:00.971
<i>Good morning, birthday boy.
Please!</i>

40:01.040 --> 40:03.884
Does thinking of this
always make you so angry?

40:10.520 --> 40:11.885
<i>Do you miss your father?</i>

40:19.960 --> 40:22.725
<i>I can show you
your past.</i>

40:30.080 --> 40:31.127
I understand.

41:15.040 --> 41:17.930
it's gonna make his day
to see his Cousin Rafferty.

41:18.000 --> 41:19.729
I hope so.

41:19.800 --> 41:23.646
it's been forever
since I've seen him.

41:23.720 --> 41:26.803
Charles, look who's here
to see you!

41:28.120 --> 41:30.441
These plants,
they kept his brain alive.

41:31.240 --> 41:32.446
I swear he remembers all the
days of the week

41:32.520 --> 41:33.521
they need watering,

41:33.600 --> 41:35.523
<i>but none
of the other nurses here.</i>

41:35.600 --> 41:37.045
isn't that right, Charles?

41:42.560 --> 41:45.530
Charles? Cousin Rafferty's
here to see you.

41:48.240 --> 41:49.287
<i>I'll</i> leave you to it.

41:50.680 --> 41:52.808
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

41:52.880 --> 41:54.644
Hugh, is that you?

41:55.640 --> 41:58.246
No... my name is Rafferty.

41:58.320 --> 42:01.529
Charles, do you
remember Gordon Dunn?

42:01.600 --> 42:03.204
The doctor?

42:03.280 --> 42:04.884
Do I know you?

42:11.960 --> 42:13.450
You brought it.

42:14.400 --> 42:15.447
Do you want to watch?

42:16.800 --> 42:19.201
Yes, please.

42:23.040 --> 42:24.041
Come on.

43:10.400 --> 43:13.609
Okay, Buster. All right.

43:29.280 --> 43:34.320
My life. That's my life.

43:38.240 --> 43:41.244
Cindy was... was my wife.

43:42.520 --> 43:46.570
I was always true to her.

43:47.680 --> 43:50.126
Charles, who are
the other people

43:50.200 --> 43:51.770
in the group
working with Gordon?

43:51.840 --> 43:53.251
I need to find them.

43:55.160 --> 43:59.131
I remember one,
a woman, Allison.

43:59.240 --> 44:02.289
She came here
to see me a few times.

44:02.360 --> 44:04.169
Do you remember
her last name?

44:06.960 --> 44:08.325
She never told me.

44:09.280 --> 44:11.647
Just one more question,

44:11.720 --> 44:13.210
if you can remember.

44:15.400 --> 44:17.289
When you were recording
your memories,

44:17.360 --> 44:21.649
what did Gordon tell you about
going back to a specific moment?

44:24.240 --> 44:29.406
l-lt was all about focus...

44:29.520 --> 44:30.521
Focus?

44:38.600 --> 44:43.481
I thought I told you,
you have to let the water drain.

44:43.560 --> 44:46.245
- Um, okay.
<i>- I'll</i> look at it myself.

44:51.160 --> 44:52.446
Thank you, Charles.

45:06.120 --> 45:07.360
Let it drain.

45:25.000 --> 45:27.082
Yeah, sweets.

45:27.200 --> 45:28.645
Good afternoon, Mrs. Dunn.

45:28.720 --> 45:29.960
Good afternoon.

45:30.080 --> 45:33.289
So, we got the results
of the toxicology report.

45:33.360 --> 45:36.204
- And?
- Well, there were a few spikes,

45:36.280 --> 45:39.648
but nothing that indicate
anything unusual.

45:39.720 --> 45:41.722
Well, what about
the gunshots?

45:41.840 --> 45:43.683
it's still
an ongoing investigation.

45:43.800 --> 45:45.370
Now, we're still
running ballistics,

45:45.440 --> 45:47.681
and Cortex is cooperating
with background checks

45:47.760 --> 45:49.250
as well as security footage.

45:49.320 --> 45:51.209
Eh, Lawton came 'round

45:51.280 --> 45:53.408
this morning
to reassure me.

45:53.520 --> 45:56.251
I think he just wanted to get
into Gordon's office.

45:56.320 --> 45:59.483
Was everything all right
between you and Gordon?

45:59.560 --> 46:01.767
Mm. Goodbye, Detective.

46:07.280 --> 46:08.361
<i>I'll</i> be in touch.

46:20.440 --> 46:23.364
- Allison?
- She's not here.

46:23.440 --> 46:24.965
Can I help you?

46:25.040 --> 46:27.930
Yes, my name is Basil.
I work for Cortex.

46:28.000 --> 46:29.889
She's part of an experiment
group for us,

46:29.960 --> 46:32.122
and it's my job to check in
on the participants

46:32.200 --> 46:34.771
from time to time and make sure
they're doing well.

46:34.840 --> 46:36.649
- You work for Cortex?
- Yes, ma'am.

46:36.720 --> 46:38.210
And what is your name?

46:38.280 --> 46:40.681
Basil. Basil Pine.

46:40.760 --> 46:43.491
Well, Basil,
if that's the case,

46:43.560 --> 46:46.131
you are truly shit
at your job.

46:47.800 --> 46:48.961
I'm sorry?

46:49.040 --> 46:50.644
Allison is dead.

46:50.720 --> 46:53.087
She killed herself
three weeks ago.

46:53.160 --> 46:54.889
You didn't know.

46:57.560 --> 46:58.721
I'm sorry.

46:58.800 --> 47:00.404
Sorry doesn't bring back
my sister.

47:00.480 --> 47:03.290
She was too fragile to be part
of your idiotic experiment.

47:03.360 --> 47:06.330
Anyone with half an eye
could've seen that.

47:06.400 --> 47:07.731
I have her memories.

47:14.160 --> 47:17.687
I know about the difficulties
in your past, Allison.

47:31.720 --> 47:33.768
I know the medications
aren't working.

47:35.840 --> 47:37.126
I can help.

47:37.200 --> 47:39.248
Happy birthday, Alli-boo!

47:43.040 --> 47:44.769
<i>This may take a while.</i>

47:44.880 --> 47:46.291
<i>It's a process.</i>

47:46.360 --> 47:48.647
<i>It may get worse
before it gets better.</i>

47:54.680 --> 47:58.082
That birthday,
we surprised her.

47:58.160 --> 48:01.323
That was the last time
I saw her truly happy.

48:01.440 --> 48:03.761
Do you think she
blamed the machine?

48:05.960 --> 48:10.284
I think it suffocated her
in her own past.

48:14.480 --> 48:16.960
What's the point
of this, anyway?

48:17.080 --> 48:18.809
Why does the machine exist?

48:18.880 --> 48:20.325
I'm not sure, exactly.

48:20.400 --> 48:25.201
But Gordon Dunn believed
that we don't know

48:25.280 --> 48:28.363
the true value of a moment
until it becomes a memory.

48:28.440 --> 48:30.647
Maybe he was...

48:30.760 --> 48:32.569
trying to get people to see the
value of a moment

48:32.680 --> 48:36.082
before it changes
or gets lost forever.

48:36.160 --> 48:39.084
Well, that's very nice
and flowery, but...

48:39.160 --> 48:42.164
Did anyone
from Cortex contact you?

48:42.240 --> 48:44.129
Gordon, or someone
from his group?

48:44.200 --> 48:48.649
One phone call
from some guy named Robert.

48:48.720 --> 48:50.882
- Lawton?
- That's right.

48:50.960 --> 48:54.760
He offered me a check as long as
I didn't talk to anyone.

48:54.840 --> 48:56.729
- Did you take it?
- Of course I took it.

48:56.800 --> 48:59.644
Who couldn't use $50,000?

48:59.720 --> 49:02.610
Anyway, you can't fight these
corporations. You never win.

49:02.680 --> 49:03.681
No.

49:08.120 --> 49:10.088
I'm very sorry
about your sister.

49:13.960 --> 49:17.726
You know, there was
another guy came by,

49:17.800 --> 49:20.326
a young guy,
kind of strange.

49:21.160 --> 49:24.607
He said he was a researcher
from the doctor... Gordon.

49:24.680 --> 49:26.682
What did he want?

49:26.760 --> 49:28.649
To know if Allison
really killed herself.

49:28.720 --> 49:29.960
That was all.

49:30.040 --> 49:31.883
He seemed shocked
when I said yes.

49:31.960 --> 49:33.325
You remember his name?

49:33.400 --> 49:35.641
Neil Frankel.

49:36.520 --> 49:38.602
- The valentine.
- What's that?

49:38.680 --> 49:41.843
Nothing, just trying
to remember the name.

49:41.920 --> 49:43.285
Mm.

49:43.360 --> 49:45.931
Well, that's what he said.

49:46.000 --> 49:49.083
But then again, you said your
name was Basil Pine.

50:33.160 --> 50:37.165

Somebody help me!

50:46.640 --> 50:47.687
Please!

51:54.160 --> 51:55.730
Who are you
working for?

51:55.840 --> 51:59.128
An interested party.
Who are you?

51:59.200 --> 52:01.851
I worked with Gordon.
I was a research assistant.

52:01.920 --> 52:02.921
Neil Frankel?

52:04.880 --> 52:06.245
How did you find me?

52:06.320 --> 52:08.243
I remembered your face
from the product launch.

52:08.320 --> 52:09.810
I tracked you down.

52:09.880 --> 52:12.008
- Pretty good memory.
- it's photographic.

52:12.080 --> 52:13.320
That's the reason why Gordon
wanted me

52:13.440 --> 52:14.441
a part of the test group.

52:14.520 --> 52:16.602
- He found it curious.
- What do you want from me?

52:16.680 --> 52:17.966
The machine.

52:19.200 --> 52:20.884
ls it missing?

52:20.960 --> 52:23.042
- We need the machine!
- Who's we?

52:23.160 --> 52:26.289
- Cortex!
- I don't... I don't have it.

52:26.360 --> 52:28.442
But I can help you find it
if you help me.

52:29.880 --> 52:30.881
How?

52:31.000 --> 52:32.331
Tell me what led to
Allison's suicide.

52:32.400 --> 52:34.289
You're not supposed
to know about that.

52:34.360 --> 52:35.691
There are people
looking for you...

52:35.760 --> 52:37.171
A man has
been murdered.

52:37.240 --> 52:38.685
We got bigger things
to worry about.

52:38.800 --> 52:40.529
- It was an aneurysm.
- That's what they say,

52:40.600 --> 52:43.126
but if you trusted Lawton, we
wouldn't be meeting like this.

52:43.200 --> 52:45.043
Unless this is a set up.

52:46.360 --> 52:47.930
Why did you
go see Allison?

52:48.000 --> 52:49.525
I wanted to see
if it was true.

52:49.600 --> 52:52.285
About her suicide?
But she'd been dead

52:52.360 --> 52:53.771
for weeks
when you got there.

52:53.840 --> 52:56.081
I didn't know that.
Not even Gordon knew...

52:56.160 --> 52:57.605
How could you not know?

52:57.680 --> 52:59.364
Her test phases
were over, it...

52:59.440 --> 53:01.249
Lawton didn't
want us to know.

53:01.320 --> 53:02.765
He was hiding it.

53:02.840 --> 53:04.888
Yes, could you imagine
the headlines if it got out

53:04.960 --> 53:07.122
that a patient had killed
herself during trials?

53:07.200 --> 53:08.611
That would've been the story.

53:08.680 --> 53:10.569
It would've ended
the whole thing.

53:10.640 --> 53:12.005
By the time Gordon
found out,

53:12.080 --> 53:13.570
he had no choice but to continue
with the launch.

53:13.640 --> 53:15.608
But he didn't
know everything.

53:15.680 --> 53:17.682
The research,
it's flawed.

53:17.760 --> 53:20.206
- Lawton manipulated it.
- Why would they do that?

53:20.280 --> 53:22.851
Because a not so small
percentage of people

53:22.920 --> 53:25.844
were prone to adverse effects
of the machine.

53:25.920 --> 53:27.331
Adverse how?

53:27.400 --> 53:29.846
Explicit and emotional memories
getting confused

53:29.920 --> 53:31.445
and playing out in reality,

53:31.560 --> 53:34.530
over-firing of synapses,
hallucinations, time collapse.

53:36.160 --> 53:38.606
Just like Allison.

53:38.680 --> 53:40.762
If Gordon had known,
he would've fixed it,

53:40.840 --> 53:41.841
I don't have a doubt,

53:41.920 --> 53:45.367
but he would've needed
time, months,

53:45.440 --> 53:47.442
and that's something
that Lawton didn't have.

53:47.520 --> 53:49.841
He made certain promises.

53:51.120 --> 53:52.610
There are issues
to be figured out,

53:52.680 --> 53:55.604
but the machine
is incredible.

53:55.680 --> 53:57.569
What it can do
for people, it...

53:59.360 --> 54:02.330
Gordon deserves to be
remembered as a genius.

54:02.400 --> 54:04.971
I think we're
done here.

54:05.040 --> 54:07.327
If you find the machine,
you know where I work.

54:08.280 --> 54:10.851
I'm looking for a young woman
who was part of the test group.

54:12.560 --> 54:14.847
Well, there were two,
and now one of them's dead.

54:54.320 --> 54:57.881
<i>Mom? Mommy?</i>

54:57.960 --> 54:59.007
<i>Please.</i>

55:05.160 --> 55:06.605
<i>I love you.</i>

55:12.440 --> 55:14.169
Gordon.

55:32.360 --> 55:36.251
We've tracked down the group,
but none have the machine.

55:38.720 --> 55:40.961
I was saving this...

55:43.560 --> 55:45.005
for Gordon's return.

55:45.080 --> 55:47.208
I'm sure he
would've wanted you

55:47.320 --> 55:49.163
to enjoy it
nonetheless.

55:52.240 --> 55:53.890
Do you have any idea

55:53.960 --> 55:59.171
the amount of pressure
crushing down on me?

56:02.880 --> 56:04.041
We'll find it.

56:05.640 --> 56:06.721
Yes, you will.

56:17.400 --> 56:19.368
<i>Good morning, birthday boy.</i>

56:22.920 --> 56:24.081
Please.

56:24.160 --> 56:25.525
Does thinking of this

56:25.600 --> 56:27.807
always make you so angry?

56:27.880 --> 56:30.451
Wendy, this will help.

56:34.760 --> 56:36.649
<i>So, when you think of it,
do you still feel fear?</i>

56:38.120 --> 56:41.522
<i>- Mom?
- Does your heart rate increase?</i>

56:41.600 --> 56:43.011
Mommy!

56:44.600 --> 56:45.886
<i>I understand.</i>

57:20.480 --> 57:22.244
<i>I'll</i> be here
if you have any questions.

57:31.840 --> 57:33.444
it's beautiful, isn't it?

57:34.560 --> 57:35.561
Exquisite.

57:36.640 --> 57:38.290
Reminds me of a memory.

57:38.360 --> 57:40.761
Yeah? Of what?

57:40.840 --> 57:42.729
My father.

57:42.800 --> 57:45.371
He was a real outdoorsman.

57:45.480 --> 57:48.563
Hunting, fishing,
hiking, all of it.

57:48.640 --> 57:51.120
One day, he took my brother
and I out for a hunt.

57:51.200 --> 57:54.921
It was rare that he
took both of us.

57:55.000 --> 57:59.005
We dug a hole in the mud
and waited.

58:00.440 --> 58:02.283
I just wanted
to make him proud.

58:04.400 --> 58:08.371
After about an hour,
a rabbit popped up.

58:08.440 --> 58:10.283
I grabbed my gun,

58:10.360 --> 58:13.523
and he went from a quick hop
to a straight drop.

58:13.600 --> 58:17.321
Blood everywhere.

58:17.400 --> 58:20.802
Yeah, kind of wish
I could forget that one.

58:20.880 --> 58:23.611
You have something you
wish you could forget?

58:23.680 --> 58:27.048
Or someone?
Gordon Dunn, maybe?

58:30.400 --> 58:31.561
Who are you?

58:31.640 --> 58:33.130
I'm working for his widow.

58:34.080 --> 58:35.844
I know about you and him.

58:39.760 --> 58:42.240
- You think he was killed?
- I do.

58:42.320 --> 58:45.529
And I know you
saw him that night.

58:45.600 --> 58:47.364
I know you stole
the machine.

58:47.440 --> 58:50.444
I loved him,
and he loved me.

58:50.520 --> 58:52.409
Was it over?

58:54.440 --> 58:56.090
it's not my choice.

58:56.160 --> 58:58.083
ls that why you
took the machine?

58:58.160 --> 58:59.571
To get back at him?

58:59.680 --> 59:03.810
While I was working
with Gordon one session,

59:03.880 --> 59:07.123
he... he saw something.

59:07.200 --> 59:10.807
It was nothing incriminating,
it was just this memory

59:10.880 --> 59:13.850
from a few years ago
with the man I loved.

59:15.040 --> 59:16.121
A private moment.

59:16.200 --> 59:18.123
He had no right
to even see it.

59:18.240 --> 59:19.765
So I wanted it back.

59:22.280 --> 59:25.807
Imagine, to have your memories
watched by other people,

59:25.880 --> 59:27.723
in front of an audience?

59:27.800 --> 59:29.928
It was like my life
wasn't my own anymore.

59:32.680 --> 59:35.251
Every memory became
clouded with Gordon.

59:36.320 --> 59:38.288
But you didn't
get them back.

59:40.160 --> 59:41.730
<i>I tried.</i>

59:41.800 --> 59:43.802
<i>l took the machine
from Cortex</i>

59:43.880 --> 59:46.690
<i>and I went back
to Gordon's house.</i>

59:58.480 --> 01:00:00.562
<i>I just wanted to get
my memories back.</i>

01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:02.802
<i>l didn't care
about the rest.</i>

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:16.924
<i>- But</i> then...
- Gordon?

01:00:20.760 --> 01:00:21.761
Gordon?

01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:31.411
Gordon?

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:33.488
I even tried to go back,

01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:35.164
but everything was gone.

01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:37.447
I can't move on from this

01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:39.648
until I have my memories back.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:44.889
If you help me find
who killed Gordon...

01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:48.802
<i>I'll</i> get them back for you.

01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:55.166
If you haven't talked
to Todd yet, you should.

01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:56.651
He was furious.

01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:59.007
He was there that night?

01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:03.122
Gordon was...

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:05.726
he was a brilliant man,

01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:07.450
and a truly good man.

01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:11.927
I still haven't decided
if his creation was.

01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:15.641
Yeah, neither have I.

01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:21.408
Why are you doing this?

01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:24.645
Resolution.

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:42.287
It has one button.
Off and on.

01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:51.488
Med school. Oxford.

01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:53.682
Specifically, the woods
behind the lab.

01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:57.128
Gordon was testing on animals
and I was freeing them,

01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:59.089
and he got worried
that someone

01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:01.242
was busting
out the primates,

01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:02.885
so he came after me.

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:07.204
He found me in the woods
feeding sandwiches to Pickles.

01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:08.281
Pickles?

01:02:10.880 --> 01:02:12.120
Pickles the chimp.

01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:13.201
Okay.

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:18.725
It was a whole other time.

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:20.848
Funny how life goes, huh?

01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:23.969
Years pass, and slowly
you find yourself defined

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:25.849
not so much by the things
that you do,

01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:27.206
but the things
that you don't do.

01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:29.521
I was gonna learn French,
write a book,

01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:33.440
I was gonna have a happy,
huge, sprawling family,

01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:35.608
and one by one, I didn't
do those things,

01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:37.569
or those things
didn't happen.

01:02:37.640 --> 01:02:39.404
And I am what is left.

01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:45.844
I guess, in part, we're all
remains of unfulfilled dreams.

01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:54.370
After Jane died, Gordon wanted
to have another, and I couldn't.

01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:58.641
So he threw himself
into his work.

01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:02.122
I think he really believed

01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:04.965
that the machine could
change the past,

01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:07.771
and when he realized
that he... it didn't...

01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:13.051
he found himself another woman
who didn't remind him of that.

01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:17.930
And I still loved him.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.162
I will always love him.

01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:23.642
He was brilliant.

01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:25.609
And the last thing
that I said to him...

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:28.085
was "You're an asshole."

01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:35.488
And I have to live with that
memory and that reality and...

01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:40.961
God, it just feels like
there's no ending.

01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:43.361
I think there will
be an end to it.

01:03:43.440 --> 01:03:46.205
I believe that.

01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:50.922
And if we are, as Gordon said,
just the sum of our memories,

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:54.402
l'm really glad to have made
this one with you.

01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:34.600
I can't think of a time in my
life when I've been happier.

01:05:57.120 --> 01:05:58.360
One left.

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:37.683
No. No!

01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:01.011
Excuse me. Hello.

01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:06.004
- Pickup?
- What?

01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:08.731
Do you have a pickup?

01:07:08.800 --> 01:07:11.929
- Uh, no.
- So, how can I help you?

01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:17.488
I wanted to ask you a few
questions about Gordon Dunn.

01:07:19.240 --> 01:07:21.083
Get out of here.

01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:23.322
- Okay. Just a few questions...
- Get out of here.

01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:25.289
- Just a few quest...
- Get out!

01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:26.566
Hey. Ahem.

01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:54.687
Sir. Ahem.

01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:58.761
How did you know
the combination to the safe?

01:07:58.840 --> 01:08:01.684
l-I've seen
your memories, Todd.

01:08:02.680 --> 01:08:04.887
What do you want from me?

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:08.886
Did you kill Gordon Dunn?

01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:11.167
Put it down. Put it down!

01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:13.607
I know he was killed,
I know you were fighting,

01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:15.444
and I know you were
at Cortex that night.

01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:17.283
I didn't kill him.
Put it down!

01:08:17.359 --> 01:08:19.044
Just... why were
you fighting?

01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:23.841
<i>Okay. I'll</i> tell you.
<i>I'll</i> tell <i>you.</i>

01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:25.649
<i>I'll</i> tell you.
Just put it down.

01:08:29.279 --> 01:08:31.520
I Wanted to kill him.

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:33.966
I really did.

01:08:35.840 --> 01:08:38.046
He didn't tell us
what the machine would do.

01:08:39.359 --> 01:08:41.328
Not at all.

01:08:41.399 --> 01:08:44.051
He didn't tell us
it would...

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:47.727
bring back things
that we had buried.

01:08:47.800 --> 01:08:51.964
You know, the mind forgets
things for a reason.

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:54.520
You didn't listen!
You never listened!

01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:55.725
And now it's too late.

01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:58.000
Take it easy.

01:08:58.080 --> 01:08:59.889
Calm down, please. Please.

01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:01.609
Take it easy. Calm down.

01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:03.045
No, you don't want to...

01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:04.689
Please, don't let
this escalate.

01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:06.841
No, no. No!

01:09:11.439 --> 01:09:12.487
When I woke up...

01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:15.490
in the hospital, I had...

01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:18.529
I'd forgotten everything.

01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:22.282
And then the machine
brought it all back,

01:09:22.359 --> 01:09:25.728
and it wouldn't stop
playing in my mind.

01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:29.361
Her getting shot over...

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.081
and over.

01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:35.608
I saw it everywhere.

01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:37.569
I couldn't turn it off.

01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:41.685
It was my fault.

01:09:45.319 --> 01:09:47.482
And then I found out...

01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:50.484
that Gordon knew about
the shooting the whole time.

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:53.006
He chose you because he knew
what you'd been through.

01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:56.527
He ruined my life,
you understand?

01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:59.683
I asked him
to delete that memory,

01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:03.526
and he wouldn't do it!

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:05.090
He brought back a memory

01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:08.448
that my brain
had erased for a reason.

01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:13.526
So, yeah, I was there in that
office that night to kill him.

01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:18.489
And this time...

01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:21.131
I had my finger
on the trigger.

01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:24.850
And I couldn't do it.

01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:32.770
I knew I couldn't
live with it.

01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:45.401
Prove it.

01:11:10.160 --> 01:11:12.128
<i>...tell my life...</i>

01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:16.046
Gordon...

01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:17.246
Gordon!

01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:24.808
Uh, Todd, what are
you doing here?

01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:26.769
You fucked up
my head!

01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:29.446
You came to me
injured and hurt.

01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:35.766
No. No, you,
you came to me.

01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:39.686
My life? My life was
better before.

01:11:42.600 --> 01:11:43.931
Jesus, Todd.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.650
You ruined my life,

01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:48.087
and now you're gonna make
a bunch of money?

01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:49.207
That's not why.

01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:51.282
You don't give
a shit about anyone!

01:11:55.320 --> 01:11:56.321
Listen to me.

01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:00.610
You know, when I fall,

01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:02.250
my eyes roll back,

01:12:02.320 --> 01:12:04.721
blood splattered...
blood splattered everywhere...

01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:09.967
that's not a memory
you want.

01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:16.446
it's better than what
you've done to me.

01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:21.966
Don't do it, Todd.

01:13:02.360 --> 01:13:04.567
She lied to me.

01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:10.963
Why would Wendy
want to set you up?

01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:16.321
She blamed me for Gordon
breaking it off with her.

01:13:17.440 --> 01:13:19.647
Why?

01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:21.882
Because when I found
out about them,

01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:23.684
I threatened
Gordon with it.

01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:26.604
Told them I'd tell his wife
if he didn't fix me.

01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:29.724
He talked me back,

01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:31.808
but right after
he broke up with her.

01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:33.484
I need to see what she saw.

01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:35.244
That's not gonna happen.

01:13:35.320 --> 01:13:37.129
She's not going back
in there.

01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:38.645
<i>I'll</i> get her
on the machine.

01:13:40.440 --> 01:13:42.090
I wouldn't be so sure.

01:13:43.840 --> 01:13:46.002
I have what she wants.

01:13:56.240 --> 01:13:59.528
Ah, a brand-new tent,
going camping up at Frost Lake!

01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:02.126
Whoo! It's another
five miles to hike,

01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:03.804
but it gets us
past all the tourists.

01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:06.121
We'll have it to ourselves.
What do you say, brother?

01:14:06.200 --> 01:14:07.690
You're not here, Dash.

01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:10.001
What are you talking about?
Of course I'm here.

01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:12.401
- We're going camping, man.
- You're not here.

01:14:12.480 --> 01:14:14.801
You're dead.

01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:16.882
Dead, what
a stupid thing to say.

01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:18.883
Of course I'm here.
I'm not dead.

01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:26.607
What... Where you going, man?

01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:27.761
What is this?

01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:30.650
What the... What the hell
is going on?

01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:32.688
I'm right here!

01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:34.444
You're dead, Dash,
and it's my fault.

01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:36.648
That doesn't sound like
a brotherly thing to do.

01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:38.006
I couldn't let Dad blame me
for your death.

01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:39.844
It would only prove him right.

01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:42.685
I had to ruin your name
not to ruin my life!

01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:45.001
You did more
than ruin my name.

01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:00.565
We found him.
He came to see the old man.

01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:02.011
He matches the description,

01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:04.686
and the nurses said
he was carrying a briefcase.

01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:06.967
Same one Gordon
used to bring.

01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:08.929
<i>Let me take care of it.</i>

01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:10.331
Understood.

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:19.009
- James?
- Hi, can I come in?

01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:20.206
I need to talk to you.

01:15:21.360 --> 01:15:22.361
Are you okay?

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:25.568
James, what's the matter?

01:15:27.320 --> 01:15:29.084
I need to tell
you something.

01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:31.003
I haven't been
completely honest with you.

01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:33.321
- Why do you have that?
- I took it.

01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:37.086
You stole it?
That's Gordon's life's work.

01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:38.969
I'm trying to figure out
what happened to him.

01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:40.041
I'm so close!

01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:41.849
This machine, it's...

01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:43.410
Who is that?

01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:49.363
- Oh, it's Lawton.
- Oh, shit.

01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:50.970
You can't let him
know that I'm here.

01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:52.849
You stole the machine.
Why wouldn't I?

01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:54.684
Because I think I know
who killed Gordon,

01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:57.286
and Lawton has been lying.
He lied to you, Carolyn...

01:15:57.360 --> 01:15:59.089
...and he lied to Gordon.

01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:02.090
Please, Carolyn,
you have to believe me.

01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:14.602
- Robert.
- I need to talk to you, Carolyn.

01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:17.846
Come in.

01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:29.246
Can I get you anything?

01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:32.164
No. No, I'm fine,
thank you.

01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:35.282
How can I help?

01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:37.050
There seems to be more
to Gordon's death.

01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:40.640
Hmm, in what way?

01:16:40.720 --> 01:16:44.042
When I saw him that night
in... in the office,

01:16:44.160 --> 01:16:46.891
he had the Rememory machine
with him,

01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:50.965
but in the morning, and I was
one of the first ones there,

01:16:51.040 --> 01:16:53.361
it was gone,
his office ransacked.

01:16:53.440 --> 01:16:54.566
Someone took it.

01:16:57.200 --> 01:16:59.931
Are you saying someone
killed him for the machine?

01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.809
It rather would appear so.

01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:05.369
Tent's all set up.

01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:06.805
<i>Let's start a fire.</i>

01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:11.050
Why haven't you told anyone?

01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:12.804
We need to keep this quiet.

01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:15.565
Word cannot get out
that the machine is missing.

01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:18.530
- You can't just not tell...
- Carolyn.

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:20.090
I know who did this.

01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:25.331
Do you know who this is?

01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:33.810
- No.
- His name is Samuel Bloom.

01:17:33.880 --> 01:17:36.565
No, he doesn't
use it much.

01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:38.927
He has the machine,

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:43.562
and we believe he's the one
responsible for Gordon's death.

01:17:43.640 --> 01:17:45.483
If you see him,
or he tries to get

01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:47.164
in contact with you
in any way,

01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:50.608
it's crucial that you
let me know immediately.

01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:52.091
As you know, the...

01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:54.527
the police have been
useless in this matter...

01:17:56.640 --> 01:17:58.563
but Cortex won't be.

01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:01.323
- Sure.
- Good.

01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:07.766
Carolyn, it's important...

01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:09.968
that word of
this doesn't get out

01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:13.880
- for Gordon's work.
- Of course.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:17.800
I know that he and I have had
our differences in our approach,

01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:22.005
but you must know
that I believed in him,

01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:25.880
and I only want his creation
to be his legacy.

01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:28.531
You want that, don't you?

01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:33.328
I would imagine that a man
so obsessed with memory

01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:35.801
would want people
to remember him,

01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:37.644
more than his invention.

01:18:38.920 --> 01:18:41.002
Yes, of course.

01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:48.765
You know, I would...

01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:55.089
I would hate it if I found out
that you were lying.

01:18:57.840 --> 01:18:59.444
I think you
should leave.

01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:02.201
Good evening.

01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:20.724
- Who are you?
- Carolyn, please.

01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:22.211
Tell me, or I'm
calling the police.

01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:24.647
I'm sorry I lied to you.
I had to.

01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:26.882
- Why?
- To help.

01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:28.530
By stealing the machine?
What's your name?

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:31.729
What's your real name?

01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:33.689
- Samuel Bloom.
- Did you kill Gordon?

01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:36.889
- No.
- Did you even know him?

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:38.843
Did you meet at the hotel?

01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:41.440
Was any of that true,
the story that you told me?

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:46.809
He told me about Jane.

01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:50.483
How he blamed
himself, and...

01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:53.891
how much he missed her...

01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:56.964
that she wanted
to go to Scotland

01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:59.008
to see the real castles,

01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:03.722
and you were planning
on taking her.

01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:06.121
You were going to surprise her
for her tenth birthday.

01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:11.730
That he loved you more
than anything, and he just...

01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:13.529
He couldn't go on
without you,

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:18.322
but there were times when you
reminded him so much of Jane

01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:21.529
that he just
couldn't bear it,

01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:24.331
that he was working
on something revolutionary

01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:27.324
that would allow him
to be with her again.

01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:35.962
I need your help, Carolyn.

01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:40.204
There was a woman, part of the
test group, Wendy Polk.

01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:43.526
That's her.

01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:46.169
She lied to me.

01:20:46.240 --> 01:20:49.562
I know now that she was the
last person to see Gordon alive.

01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:52.086
We need to get her
on this machine.

01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:54.487
We need to see
what she saw.

01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:58.203
I'm gonna need
your help to do that.

01:21:03.480 --> 01:21:04.891
I want to try it.

01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:29.329
- You ready?
- Mm. No.

01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:50.282
<i>My beauty!-</i>

01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:02.889
You have made
a commitment to me.

01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:04.485
It will free us up.

01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:07.131
<i>You have made
a commitment to me.</i>

01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:16.211
Can I put the star
on top of the tree?

01:22:45.160 --> 01:22:46.286
Look, Mommy!

01:22:47.880 --> 01:22:48.881
Beautiful.

01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:51.927
I know you were
the last one who saw him.

01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:55.562
- And I know you killed him.
- No.

01:24:57.600 --> 01:24:58.806
I loved him.

01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:00.484
Oh, is that right?

01:25:00.560 --> 01:25:04.485
I hated him the day he died,
but I was in love with him.

01:25:04.560 --> 01:25:07.291
All you were to him
was a distraction.

01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:10.443
I know more than you think.

01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:12.887
I know a part of his life
that you don't.

01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:16.201
I still believed in him.

01:25:16.280 --> 01:25:18.931
I also know memories he had
that you don't know about,

01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:20.525
that he only shared with me.

01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:22.364
I know a whole man
you didn't.

01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:26.081
Wow.

01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:29.050
You're quite a confident
little shit, aren't you?

01:25:30.800 --> 01:25:32.962
But he chose you, so...

01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:35.281
We can't even share
our stories,

01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:37.971
and now I am left
with nothing.

01:25:39.800 --> 01:25:42.451
Well, we're both left
with nothing.

01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:47.560
l just... I want
all this to be over.

01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:49.483
I want my memories back.

01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:52.450
Well, if you want
your memories back...

01:25:53.840 --> 01:25:55.842
I'd like you to do
something for me.

01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:20.690
Gordon? Oh, Jesus Christ!

01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:30.166
Gordon? Gordon, wake up!

01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:32.163
Please wake up!

01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:34.891
Please wake up.
Please, please, please wake up.

01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:36.001
Wake up.

01:26:38.440 --> 01:26:40.568
What have you done?
What did you do?

01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:45.287
Okay.

01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:48.404
Okay. Okay.

01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:25.964
Oh...

01:27:40.840 --> 01:27:43.161
So he was already dead
when you arrived.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:46.286
I'm so sorry.

01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:52.610
These are yours.

01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:08.801
Thank you.

01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:17.205
You should have this.

01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:46.560
it's time.

01:29:36.200 --> 01:29:39.329
Ah, it's good
to be home, brother.

01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:41.562
it's good to have
you home, Dash.

01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:46.730
- No, no, no, no, no.
- What, I'm driving!

01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:48.609
No, no!
This is my sweet ride.

01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:50.569
Man, I'm driving
your sweet ride.

01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:51.801
Okay. Okay.

01:29:54.760 --> 01:29:56.649

<i>You ruined my life,</i>

01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:53.887
<i>and now you're gonna make
a bunch of money?</i>

01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:55.530
<i>Jesus, Todd.</i>

01:36:55.600 --> 01:36:58.171
<i>You don't give a shit
about anyone!</i>

01:36:58.240 --> 01:37:00.402
<i>Todd, listen to me.</i>

01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:03.051
<i>The moment I fall,
and my eyes roll back,</i>

01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:04.565
<i>blood splattered everywhere,</i>

01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:06.369
you'll have to live with that,

01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:08.283
and it'll be worse
than any memory

01:37:08.360 --> 01:37:10.010
that was brought back
for you.

01:37:11.200 --> 01:37:13.282
Oh...

01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:18.924
it's better...
than what you've done to me.

01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:26.961
Todd...

01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:43.241
Oh, God.

01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:45.447
Oh, God.

01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:50.126
What have I done?

01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:52.321
What have I done?

01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:02.771
Oh, God.

01:38:37.080 --> 01:38:38.730
- Here she comes.
- Here she comes.

01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:39.961
Let's take a picture.

01:38:40.040 --> 01:38:41.963
- ls it picture time?
- Get together.

01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:43.849
<i>Okay, we're together,
we're together.</i>

01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:46.287
- Say cheese.
- Cheese!

01:38:46.360 --> 01:38:47.805
Perfect.

01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:49.166
Let's go build a sandcastle.

01:38:49.240 --> 01:38:50.401
Build a sandcastle.

01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:52.050
I can't think
of a time in my life

01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:54.088
when I've been happier.

01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:56.208
Carolyn.

01:38:57.200 --> 01:38:58.440
Me neither.

01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:00.170
Everything in its right place.

01:39:00.240 --> 01:39:02.004
Right place.

01:39:16.560 --> 01:39:17.686
<i>...star on top of the tree?</i>

01:39:31.440 --> 01:39:33.124
<i>Cheese!</i>

01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:35.161
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:43.086
<i>Dad, I love you.</i>

01:39:57.960 --> 01:40:01.726
That was a beautiful day,
sweetie.

01:40:03.400 --> 01:40:07.769
It was a beautiful day,
but there were so many days.

01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:16.046
There were so many memories.

01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:38.006
Mm...

01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:56.165
The machine killed him.

01:40:57.560 --> 01:41:00.245
When I met Gordon
at the hotel...

01:41:02.200 --> 01:41:03.770
I knew who he was.

01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:07.722
I wanted
to apologize, but...

01:41:08.840 --> 01:41:10.410
there were no words...

01:41:12.480 --> 01:41:14.881
just like there are
no words right now.

01:41:16.480 --> 01:41:19.848
I wanted to tell you everything,
but l-l-l...

01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:22.881
I just, I couldn't.

01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:33.200
If you watch this,
you'll understand who I am...

01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:36.488
who I really am.

01:41:38.680 --> 01:41:40.444
I'm truly sorry, Carolyn.

01:41:42.080 --> 01:41:43.889
I'm so sorry.

01:41:44.920 --> 01:41:46.604
Goodbye.

01:41:47.760 --> 01:41:49.046
Sam...

01:41:52.120 --> 01:41:54.168
Sam, James, Rafferty...

01:41:57.720 --> 01:42:01.805
Whoever you really are,
thank you.

01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:09.006
<i>We deﬁne our lives
by our memories.</i>

01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:11.600
Who we are
on a particular day

01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:16.846
is the result of memories
from every day before.

01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:22.205
<i>But memories are elastic,
malleable,</i>

01:43:22.280 --> 01:43:24.806
<i>often mercurial things.</i>

01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:27.770
<i>I think of my own life,
the sum of my memories.</i>

01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:32.402
<i>Like any man, I've done many
things that I feel guilt for.</i>

01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:35.086
<i>I feel pain
from so many things...</i>

01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:40.250
<i>for the damndest of things.</i>

01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:43.529
Memories of true happiness
are what make life worth living,

01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:48.640
but they're so often lost
in the sea of bad ones.

01:44:01.640 --> 01:44:04.371
We are nothing more
than the memories we keep...

01:44:08.280 --> 01:44:10.521
<i>memories of overwhelming joy...</i>

01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:14.246
<i>profound sadness...</i>

01:44:17.240 --> 01:44:18.321
<i>gratitude...</i>

01:44:21.280 --> 01:44:22.281
<i>pride...</i>

01:44:25.160 --> 01:44:26.161
<i>grief...</i>

01:44:30.320 --> 01:44:31.401
<i>despair...</i>

01:44:34.840 --> 01:44:35.921
<i>remorse...</i>

01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:40.926
<i>passion...</i>

01:44:43.960 --> 01:44:45.007
<i>regret...</i>

01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:50.521
<i>Regret.</i>

01:45:05.440 --> 01:45:06.521
<i>Regret.</i>

01:45:09.840 --> 01:45:12.525
<i>But the strongest memories
we carry with us</i>

01:45:12.600 --> 01:45:14.329
<i>are ones of love.</i>

01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:19.605
Afternoon, Oliver.

01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:20.681
Afternoon.

01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:29.041
it's Sam.

01:45:31.800 --> 01:45:33.131
My name is Sam.

01:45:34.840 --> 01:45:37.161
Well, then, afternoon, Sam.

01:46:03.080 --> 01:46:07.483
<i>And finally, hope.</i>

01:46:43.640 --> 01:46:45.961
