07:29.316 --> 07:31.883
This place is just
spectacular-looking.

07:31.885 --> 07:33.218

            Hello.

07:44.998 --> 07:47.799
      And so it gives me
        great pleasure

07:47.801 --> 07:49.201
      to welcome the man

07:49.203 --> 07:53.338
  who has built this company
    into what it is today.

07:53.340 --> 07:56.007
     Our founder and CEO,

07:56.009 --> 07:57.309
      the one and only...

08:05.352 --> 08:06.518
     Thank you, everyone,

08:06.520 --> 08:09.488
     for making this year
         a great one.

08:09.490 --> 08:12.090
     It's because of each
     and every one of you

08:12.092 --> 08:14.593
   that this company has had
   the success that it has.

08:14.595 --> 08:16.294
   Now, as most of you know,

08:16.296 --> 08:17.996
     we have been working
        round the clock

08:17.998 --> 08:20.365
      developing a pitch
 for the Wilson Taylor Group.

08:20.367 --> 08:22.901
    And... I'm very excited

08:22.903 --> 08:26.004
           to announce
that Dirk has brought me a pitch

08:26.006 --> 08:28.840
    that is even making me
      a fan of Christmas.

08:28.842 --> 08:30.308
         It's an idea

08:30.310 --> 08:33.211
  that's dedicated to keeping
the spirit of Christmas alive,

08:33.212 --> 08:35.514
    every day of the year.

08:35.515 --> 08:38.450
  He calls it "Holidays 365."

08:39.986 --> 08:42.386
    Dirk, come on up here,
          take a bow.

08:48.428 --> 08:52.097
           In fact,
  I am so excited about this,

08:52.099 --> 08:55.367
       I've invited Dirk
  to come with me to Seattle,

08:55.369 --> 08:58.603
       to bring the idea
 to Mr. Wilson Taylor himself.

09:00.040 --> 09:03.174

     and merry Christmas.

This is a party!

09:11.952 --> 09:13.084
       And it's time now

09:13.086 --> 09:15.954

        gift exchange.

09:15.956 --> 09:18.490

09:28.969 --> 09:30.368
               I'm-I'm gonna go.

09:30.370 --> 09:31.937
What? No! No, no.
Don't go.

09:31.939 --> 09:34.606
       I'm fine. Honest.
        Just have fun.

                I'm sorry, Miss.

09:45.452 --> 09:47.319
I didn't mean to startle you...

09:47.321 --> 09:51.189
 but you forgot your present,
 and I chose it just for you.

09:51.191 --> 09:53.124
          Oh! Really?

09:56.930 --> 09:58.496
      Thank you so much.

09:58.498 --> 10:00.699
           You are most welcome.

10:14.147 --> 10:15.513
        Hey!

10:16.516 --> 10:18.216
What are you doing?

10:18.218 --> 10:19.684
       I am stopping you

10:19.686 --> 10:21.086
         from leaving
    a perfectly good party,

10:21.088 --> 10:22.253
   just to sulk and go home.

10:22.255 --> 10:24.389
No, that's not what I'm doing.

10:24.391 --> 10:26.024
    Please, I've known you
   since the seventh grade.

10:26.026 --> 10:27.425
          I know you
   better than you know you.

10:27.427 --> 10:29.094
         Did you hear
     what Peter just said?

10:29.096 --> 10:30.528
     Dirk stole my pitch.

10:30.530 --> 10:31.730
         I mean, he took my work

10:31.732 --> 10:32.964
              and just passed
              it off as his own.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.232
            I know.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.134
  I mean, the nerve of Dirk!
        Who does that?

10:36.136 --> 10:37.235
       It's just wrong.

10:37.237 --> 10:38.503
It is wrong.

10:38.505 --> 10:39.604
What can I say

10:39.606 --> 10:40.972
 that you don't already know?

10:40.974 --> 10:43.241
    Dirk has no integrity.

10:43.243 --> 10:44.676
         It's not like
   he hasn't done it before.

10:44.678 --> 10:47.445
   I just want you to stop,
calm down, take a deep breath.

10:49.082 --> 10:51.583
       You can't let him
   ruin your day and night.

10:51.585 --> 10:55.253
Having someone
steal your work is awful.

10:55.255 --> 10:56.488
           I get it.

10:56.490 --> 10:58.023
    I'm sorry it happened.

10:59.493 --> 11:01.292
What do you got there?

11:01.294 --> 11:03.695
           Oh, it's, uh,
           my gift from "Santa."

Well, come on, then,
let's check it.

a coupon for a spa day.

I just--

12:39.693 --> 12:41.192
After the day I've had,

12:41.194 --> 12:43.094
I'm not much into
wishes right now.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.329
You should give it
to someone else.

                 Oh, ho, ho, ho!

12:45.532 --> 12:47.298
          Doesn't work that way,
          I'm afraid.

12:47.300 --> 12:49.534
      That one's for you,
        and you alone.

That's very kind, but really...

12:52.405 --> 12:54.372
                    So what
                    would it be?

    to wish for something,

to wish for something...

to have courage, for a change.

          to speak up

   that needed to be heard.

    that's a lot of wishes.

                before we speak.

15:43.510 --> 15:45.276
Did you think
that if you called it,

15:45.278 --> 15:48.446
     what, "Holidays 365"
  instead of "Christmas 365,"

15:48.448 --> 15:49.681

                            Wow.

15:57.991 --> 15:59.490
                    I got to say

15:59.492 --> 16:02.760
                   I am shocked,
                   Sara, and...

16:04.531 --> 16:05.897
What's going on here?

16:05.899 --> 16:08.366
            It's-- It's nothing,
            Peter, really.

16:08.368 --> 16:09.400
              I-I can handle it.

16:09.402 --> 16:11.436
          Hi, Peter.
     What's going on here

16:11.438 --> 16:13.304
     is I'm done with Dirk
        taking my work

16:13.306 --> 16:14.439
and passing it off as his own.

16:14.441 --> 16:15.740
      I'm a team player,

16:15.742 --> 16:18.009
       and I understand
      that part of my job

16:18.011 --> 16:20.945
is giving creative suggestions
          to my boss,

16:20.947 --> 16:22.213
     but enough is enough!

16:22.215 --> 16:25.616
     85% of his proposals
       are my proposals.

16:25.618 --> 16:28.553
      I mean, if it's not
   Taylor's "Holidays 365",

16:28.555 --> 16:30.555
    or the Quincy Proposal,
             or--

16:30.557 --> 16:31.956
     -Or the Parker thing?
     -Or the Parker thing!

16:31.958 --> 16:34.592
[Molly]: And the Hunter's pitch.
     Their entire campaign.

16:34.594 --> 16:36.661
[Sara]: Yes! The Hunter's pitch.
       That was mine, too!

16:36.663 --> 16:37.762
       Thank you, Molly.

16:41.034 --> 16:43.701
             [♪♪♪]

16:43.703 --> 16:46.971
 I'm sorry for making a scene
  at your party, but I just--

16:46.973 --> 16:48.473
     I can't work for Dirk

16:48.475 --> 16:50.575
        if this is how
   I'm going to be treated.

16:52.712 --> 16:55.513
          I'm sorry,
         I just can't.

16:56.583 --> 16:59.117
             Yeah!

16:59.119 --> 17:01.386
         [scoffs] Wow.

17:01.388 --> 17:03.154
      Peter, I am sorry.

17:03.156 --> 17:05.857
              I-I-I will
              take care of this.

17:11.765 --> 17:14.766
Sara? Sara!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

17:15.935 --> 17:17.667
         Are you okay?

17:17.670 --> 17:19.637
     I am done with people
  treating me like a sucker.

17:19.638 --> 17:22.140
Oh, come on, people don't think
       you're a sucker.

17:22.142 --> 17:23.708
        They do, Molly.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.777
        <i> You do,</i> Molly.

17:25.779 --> 17:27.678
             What?

17:27.680 --> 17:29.380
   No, I-I don't treat you--

17:29.382 --> 17:30.715
                 No, I love you,

17:30.717 --> 17:32.016
         I really do,
  but it's not a "compliment"

17:32.018 --> 17:33.818
           to ask me
       to do your work.

17:33.820 --> 17:35.053
 And it's more than a "favor"

17:35.055 --> 17:36.888
when you ask me to bring coffee
            for you

17:36.890 --> 17:38.823
and everyone else in the office
          every day.

17:38.825 --> 17:41.392
  And just because I say yes,
   that doesn't mean that--

17:41.394 --> 17:42.660
        I am so sorry.

17:42.662 --> 17:44.495
           I don't--
 I don't know why I said that.

17:44.497 --> 17:46.064
              No.

17:46.066 --> 17:47.532
         You're right.

17:47.534 --> 17:49.667
   I have been treating you
          like that.

17:49.669 --> 17:51.102
[stunned chuckle]

17:51.104 --> 17:53.638
          I have been
   taking advantage of you.

17:53.640 --> 17:56.407
      Sara, I'm so sorry.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.643
      Molly, I don't know
    what's happening to me.

17:58.645 --> 18:00.745
   I just feel so different.

18:00.747 --> 18:03.481
I've never felt this way before.
         It's like I...

18:03.483 --> 18:05.149
  It's like I'm unstoppable!

18:05.151 --> 18:07.452
                  [laughs]
                  It's like I...

18:09.022 --> 18:10.655
        [quietly]: No.

18:10.657 --> 18:12.457
            No way.
     That's not possible.

18:13.493 --> 18:14.725
             What?

18:14.727 --> 18:16.961
    Did my wish come true?

18:19.032 --> 18:20.465
                  When you left,

18:20.467 --> 18:23.134
         I was talking
   to that Santa guy and...

18:24.571 --> 18:27.171
I wished that I could be brave.

18:27.173 --> 18:28.673
            Santa?

18:28.675 --> 18:32.477
      I wished that I would have
      courage for a change.

18:32.479 --> 18:33.945
         I wished that
  I would stop letting people

18:33.947 --> 18:35.880
    just walk all over me.

18:35.882 --> 18:39.984
And it's like, all of a sudden,
        I just feel...

18:39.986 --> 18:41.853
       I feel fearless.

18:42.989 --> 18:44.322
                        [laughs]

18:44.324 --> 18:46.224
 It's like if I have something
     I feel I need to say,

18:46.226 --> 18:48.226
       I'm gonna say it.

18:49.462 --> 18:52.230
 I mean, crazy as it sounds...

18:53.800 --> 18:55.800
  I think my wish came true.

19:01.040 --> 19:03.641
             [♪♪♪]

19:03.643 --> 19:05.143
 [Molly]: What are you doing?

19:06.613 --> 19:08.012
       After last night,

19:08.014 --> 19:10.181
      I'm fairly certain
  I don't have a job anymore.

19:10.183 --> 19:12.683
         Well, what if
     you talked to Peter?

19:12.685 --> 19:14.218
   Try explaining it a bit?

19:14.220 --> 19:16.254
 Or apologize to Dirk, maybe?

19:16.256 --> 19:18.256
        I have nothing
       to apologize for.

19:18.258 --> 19:19.857
     I just, I don't think

19:19.859 --> 19:21.225
    this is the right place
        for me anymore.

19:21.227 --> 19:22.727
     [quiet gasp]

19:22.729 --> 19:24.095
   Are you sure about that?

19:25.298 --> 19:27.565
             I am.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.183
          Absolutely.

19:45.185 --> 19:49.220
  You heard the title right.
     It's "Christmas 365."

19:49.222 --> 19:51.189
          Christmas.

19:51.191 --> 19:53.724
            Mm-hmm.

19:53.726 --> 19:55.993
         Okay, listen.
      Thank you so much.

19:55.995 --> 19:58.796
 I have got to call you back.
           Bye-bye.

20:01.701 --> 20:04.602
       Sara! Sara, Sara.
    I'm glad I caught you.

20:04.604 --> 20:06.003
Listen, I have to talk to you.

20:06.005 --> 20:08.172
 I really don't think we have
      much to talk about.

20:08.174 --> 20:10.341
        Well, if you'd
   just hear me out, that--

20:10.343 --> 20:11.709
        You're leaving?

20:11.711 --> 20:13.211
             I am.

20:13.213 --> 20:15.913
 I don't think this company's
 the right fit for me anymore.

20:15.915 --> 20:16.881
     Right, that's why I--

20:16.883 --> 20:17.949
               And I am so sorry

20:17.951 --> 20:19.283
   if I caused you any grief

20:19.285 --> 20:20.952
           by having
 that confrontation with Dirk

20:20.954 --> 20:21.953
   at the party last night.

20:21.955 --> 20:23.387
       No, I understand.

20:23.389 --> 20:25.223
   But just for the record,
      the pitch was mine,

20:25.225 --> 20:26.891
                "Christmas 365".

20:26.893 --> 20:28.893
        It was my idea.

20:28.895 --> 20:30.928
           So good luck with it,

20:30.930 --> 20:32.830
   and, uh, Merry Christmas.

20:36.703 --> 20:38.202
            Bryan!

20:38.204 --> 20:41.138
                     Yeah, boss?

20:45.778 --> 20:46.911

20:47.947 --> 20:48.946
          [wheezing]

20:48.948 --> 20:51.148
I thought your pitch
was brilliant.

20:51.150 --> 20:52.216
      But how did you--?

20:52.218 --> 20:53.684
            Stairs.

20:53.686 --> 20:54.752
                      Oh.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.087
Listen. I believe you!

20:56.089 --> 20:58.022
I know that
this was your pitch.

20:58.024 --> 20:59.857
Which is why
I am not taking it

20:59.859 --> 21:00.958
to Wilson Taylor
without you.

21:00.960 --> 21:02.326
Which is also why

21:02.328 --> 21:04.328
I have a huge
favor to ask you,

21:04.330 --> 21:07.932
 and I know this is completely
      last-minute, but...

21:07.934 --> 21:10.334
 is there any chance you could
   come to Seattle with me?

21:10.336 --> 21:12.837
As in today?

21:12.839 --> 21:15.773
   As in, our flight leaves
         in two hours?

21:15.775 --> 21:18.309
 But I... I mean, last night,
         at the party,

21:18.311 --> 21:20.011
     I made such a scene.

21:20.013 --> 21:24.215
   This is me with my stuff
 walking out of the building.

21:24.217 --> 21:25.349
            -Don't.
        -I know that...

21:25.351 --> 21:27.685
     Please don't resign.

21:27.687 --> 21:29.820
     But what about Dirk?

21:29.822 --> 21:32.189
       Dirk is no longer
       with the company.

21:33.293 --> 21:35.126
              Oh.

21:35.128 --> 21:36.661
        Okay, so let me
    just get this straight.

21:36.663 --> 21:38.362
     You just want my help
      with this project?

21:38.364 --> 21:40.298
       I want your help
      with this project,

21:40.300 --> 21:43.301
but I also want you to continue
     working for me, Sara.

21:43.303 --> 21:46.270
Wilson Taylor is just the start.

21:46.272 --> 21:47.938
     From what I've seen,

21:47.940 --> 21:51.242
you really understand marketing,
      not just web design,

21:51.244 --> 21:54.812
  and you need to be the one
   presenting Christmas 365.

21:55.848 --> 21:59.183
        And after that,
     if we're successful,

21:59.185 --> 22:00.951
there is a Director of Marketing
            position

22:00.953 --> 22:02.053
   that needs to be filled.

22:02.055 --> 22:03.854
     [panting]: Hey, boss.

22:03.856 --> 22:04.955
    Can you sign this for--

22:04.957 --> 22:06.991
And just
so we're clear--

22:06.993 --> 22:09.093
        this does come
       with a pay raise.

22:09.095 --> 22:10.828
      Fairly significant.

22:16.302 --> 22:18.936
    Okay, well, there, uh,
there would be some visual aids

22:18.938 --> 22:20.304
              that I would need.

22:20.306 --> 22:21.339
      Whatever you need.

22:21.341 --> 22:22.740
                    And, I mean,
                    Christmas

22:22.742 --> 22:24.208
       is in two days--
      I have to be back,

22:24.210 --> 22:25.343
       so I can be with
      my mom and sister.

22:25.345 --> 22:26.344
Done.

22:26.346 --> 22:28.279
          It's done.

22:28.281 --> 22:30.915
      Really? Then okay!
     Great! Great. I'm in.

22:31.951 --> 22:34.352
    Oh, and one more thing.

22:34.354 --> 22:35.986
You should wear your navy suit.

22:35.988 --> 22:37.254
     It's your best look.

22:37.256 --> 22:39.090
     It really brings out
     your baby-blue eyes.

22:39.092 --> 22:40.257
         [gasps] Uh...

22:40.259 --> 22:42.960
             [♪♪♪]

22:42.962 --> 22:45.763
        Uh, yeah. Okay.
   I guess I could do that.

22:45.765 --> 22:47.998
          Is that it?

22:48.000 --> 22:50.368
       Yeah. That's it.
  [chuckles] Yeah, that's it.

22:50.370 --> 22:52.803
           Uh, Molly?
Can you bring me to the airport?

22:52.805 --> 22:55.139
       'Cause I--I, um,
   I'll explain in the car.

22:55.141 --> 22:56.507
                   Y-Yeah. Sure.

22:56.509 --> 22:59.076
         Great! Okay.

23:02.815 --> 23:05.516
My "baby-blue eyes"?

23:05.518 --> 23:07.518
               Ah, I don't know.

23:07.520 --> 23:10.521
They're more aquamarine to me.

23:10.523 --> 23:13.290
           You weren't asking me
           about your eyes.

23:13.292 --> 23:14.458
          No.

23:14.460 --> 23:16.794
            [gulps]
  Could you sign this, boss?

23:23.803 --> 23:26.036
    They're kinda sky-blue!

23:37.450 --> 23:39.283

23:39.285 --> 23:40.951
What happens when
this thing runs out?

23:40.953 --> 23:42.953
    I mean, I'm gonna need
this courage to do this pitch.

23:42.955 --> 23:43.954
                 Don't worry!

23:43.956 --> 23:45.322
           You still have, what?

23:45.324 --> 23:46.824
         Uh, 32 hours.

23:46.826 --> 23:48.526
     Yeah, and your pitch
        is later today.

23:48.528 --> 23:50.060
  It's more than enough time.

23:50.062 --> 23:51.829
         You got this.

23:51.831 --> 23:53.063
        I can do this.

23:53.065 --> 23:54.098
           -Mm-hmm!
        -I can do this.

23:54.100 --> 23:56.834
             -Yep!
          -Oh... hi!

23:56.836 --> 23:57.868
              Oh.

23:57.870 --> 23:58.803
                             Hi.

23:58.805 --> 24:00.171
Thank you

24:00.173 --> 24:01.238
      for coming so fast.

24:01.240 --> 24:03.374
   I really appreciate this.

24:03.376 --> 24:04.408
       We should hurry.

24:04.410 --> 24:06.544
    All right, I'll be back
         by Christmas.

24:06.546 --> 24:08.312
             Okay!

24:08.314 --> 24:09.847
   Maybe you could actually
   buy me a gift this year.

24:09.849 --> 24:12.082
    Goodness, I can't wait
    until after Christmas,

24:12.084 --> 24:14.518
  when this whole wish thing
           is over.

24:14.520 --> 24:16.020
         -Thanks. Bye.
             -Bye.

24:16.022 --> 24:18.422
             [♪♪♪]

24:26.265 --> 24:28.833
             Hmm.

24:28.835 --> 24:30.868
     I'm impressed.

24:30.870 --> 24:31.902
      Seriously.

24:33.439 --> 24:35.172
     Well, I'll take that
       as a compliment.

24:35.174 --> 24:38.175
 Especially coming from a man
    who just yesterday said

24:38.177 --> 24:40.411
 "Christmas isn't happening".

24:40.413 --> 24:42.546
       I mean, not that
     I was eavesdropping,

24:42.548 --> 24:43.948
       I really wasn't.

24:43.950 --> 24:45.516
    We were in an elevator.

24:45.518 --> 24:47.084
       [chuckles] Okay.

24:47.086 --> 24:48.986
     Well, you're kind of
        misquoting me.

24:48.988 --> 24:52.356
   I mean, hearing one side
   of a partial conversation

24:52.358 --> 24:53.991
is sort of like reading
into a text message,

24:53.993 --> 24:55.059
it does not
a meaning make.

24:55.061 --> 24:56.260
         Fair enough.

24:56.262 --> 24:58.996
              You know,
              it's kind of funny

24:58.998 --> 25:00.064
          that you're so excited

25:00.066 --> 25:01.565
                about a pitch
                about Christmas,

25:01.567 --> 25:03.501
      but you don't even
        like Christmas.

25:03.503 --> 25:05.302
    I don't like Christmas?

25:05.304 --> 25:08.506
Well, that's why
I hire people like you.

25:08.508 --> 25:11.575
 If my employees are excited,
       then I'm excited.

25:11.577 --> 25:14.211
   I mean, it's basic rules
   to a successful business.

25:14.213 --> 25:17.314
      And you are wearing
  snowman earrings after all.

25:17.316 --> 25:20.918
     I feel Christmas 365
  is probably in good hands.

25:20.920 --> 25:22.353
            Right?

25:23.923 --> 25:25.589
Right now
I want to hear

25:25.591 --> 25:27.258
          if there's
    any concerns you have.

25:27.260 --> 25:28.359
             Mm...

25:28.361 --> 25:30.094
        Wilson Taylor.
        What's he like?

25:31.130 --> 25:34.899
 Oh, Wilson Taylor is a shark.

25:34.901 --> 25:37.501
            The man
   is notoriously difficult.

25:37.503 --> 25:41.539
  He didn't make his billions
      being Mr. Nice Guy.

25:41.541 --> 25:43.173
      When we're dealing
        with this guy,

25:43.175 --> 25:45.676
     we have got to bring
         our "A"-game.

25:45.678 --> 25:48.078
       "A"-game. Got it.

25:50.416 --> 25:51.682
            Listen,

25:51.684 --> 25:53.017
      there is something
       that I feel like

25:53.019 --> 25:54.351
   I need to share with you,

25:54.353 --> 25:55.653
     since we're gonna be
  doing this pitch together.

25:55.655 --> 25:58.188
     We need this account.

25:58.190 --> 26:02.092
             Okay.
   I mean, I assumed that...

26:02.094 --> 26:06.397
   Our sales have been flat
    the last two quarters.

26:06.399 --> 26:08.599
        I don't want to
    have to lay people off.

26:08.601 --> 26:11.302
I hate doing that.

26:15.708 --> 26:18.075
             [♪♪♪]

26:25.418 --> 26:28.185
 Mr. Taylor sends his regrets,

26:28.187 --> 26:30.588
       but he's decided
   to go with someone else.

26:31.624 --> 26:32.623
He does realize

26:32.625 --> 26:34.058
we flew all the way
from Chicago

26:34.060 --> 26:35.192
just for
this meeting, right?

26:35.194 --> 26:37.428
         We apologize
    for any inconvenience,

26:37.430 --> 26:40.097
     but the decision has
        just been made.

26:40.099 --> 26:41.498
                   Well, can you
                   at least

26:41.500 --> 26:43.167
      tell us who he gave
        the account to?

26:43.169 --> 26:44.602
I'm sorry.

26:44.604 --> 26:46.670
      I'm not at liberty
 to discuss that at this time.

26:46.672 --> 26:48.472
[frustrated sigh]
I think you can realize

26:48.474 --> 26:51.241
how important this is
to us. I mean, we flew--

26:51.243 --> 26:52.676
   There's nothing I can do.

26:53.679 --> 26:54.678
Now, if you'll
excuse me.

27:00.620 --> 27:03.988
       We're not leaving
until we meet with Mr. Taylor.

27:03.990 --> 27:05.422
   I'm sorry?

27:05.424 --> 27:06.657
              You either tell us
              where he is,

27:06.659 --> 27:08.359
             or we'll just go
             find him ourselves.

27:08.361 --> 27:10.761
             I find it extremely
             disrespectful

27:10.763 --> 27:12.029
               that he would go
               with someone else

27:12.031 --> 27:14.131
        without calling
        to cancel with us first.

27:14.133 --> 27:15.633
         Here we are,
 we have a meeting scheduled.

27:15.635 --> 27:18.769
 That's just the bottom line.

27:18.771 --> 27:20.170
I'm not sure
what to tell you,

27:20.172 --> 27:23.040
except that Mr. Taylor
is a very busy man.

27:23.042 --> 27:24.274
       I can assure you

27:24.276 --> 27:25.609
        we have a pitch
          we believe

27:25.611 --> 27:28.045
           your boss
 is not going to want to miss.

27:28.047 --> 27:29.747
   It'll be worth his while.

27:29.749 --> 27:31.382
        I promise you.

27:35.788 --> 27:37.788
      Will you excuse me?

27:42.261 --> 27:44.028
         Wow.

27:44.030 --> 27:45.329
              Uh, I'm-I'm sorry.

27:45.331 --> 27:46.597
               I'm sorry.
               It just came out.

27:46.599 --> 27:47.798
               I just couldn't--

27:47.800 --> 27:50.768
This is Wilson Taylor.
He is notorious for this.

27:50.770 --> 27:53.337
              Yeah. I apologize.

27:55.641 --> 27:56.774
       Oh, here she is.

27:57.777 --> 27:59.343
          Good news!

27:59.345 --> 28:02.112
          Mr. Taylor
    has agreed to see you.

28:02.114 --> 28:05.082
 But I'm afraid he has already
 left for a Christmas getaway.

28:05.084 --> 28:06.383
          Do you know
   the town of White Ridge?

28:09.488 --> 28:11.321
    Yeah, I've heard of it.

28:11.323 --> 28:14.324
    He's in the main lodge.
    He'll see you at 2:00.

28:14.326 --> 28:15.559
       You have been
       extremely helpful, Megan.

28:15.561 --> 28:16.560
              Thank you so much.

28:16.562 --> 28:17.761
        You're welcome.

28:21.067 --> 28:22.099
        Is it far away?

28:22.101 --> 28:23.534
   It's up at the ski hill.

28:23.536 --> 28:24.568
        We can make it,
        if we hurry...

28:24.570 --> 28:26.737
     but we're gonna need a car.

28:26.739 --> 28:28.772
           Let's go.

28:34.313 --> 28:35.546
     You believe this guy?

28:35.548 --> 28:37.114
            We come
     all the way out here,

28:37.116 --> 28:38.515
and he wasn't even
gonna see us?

28:38.517 --> 28:40.317
Now he expects us

28:40.319 --> 28:42.352
to drive out
to a ski lodge?

28:42.354 --> 28:44.555
That's Wilson Taylor,
ladies and gentlemen.

28:44.557 --> 28:46.623
I guess when
you're a kazillionaire,

28:46.625 --> 28:48.292
you figure
you can treat people

28:48.294 --> 28:49.526
any way you please.

28:49.528 --> 28:51.695
                      [laughing]

28:51.697 --> 28:53.497
What? It's a--
It's a thing.

28:53.499 --> 28:57.134
    Really? Is that before
  or after a "gazillionaire"?

28:57.136 --> 28:58.535
            Before.

28:58.537 --> 28:59.803
      Well, I don't care
  if you are a kazillionaire,

28:59.805 --> 29:01.572
           you don't
    treat people like this.

29:01.574 --> 29:03.774
Try telling that to him.

29:04.777 --> 29:07.444
             We better hurry up.

29:07.446 --> 29:09.413
        In order for me
      to give you a car,

29:09.415 --> 29:10.881
    I need to see your name
      on the reservation.

29:10.883 --> 29:12.716
I don't know
what to do for you.

29:12.718 --> 29:15.352
                 I wanna go home
                 now, Mom.

29:15.354 --> 29:17.554
   I know, sweetie. I know.
   Just a few more minutes.

29:17.556 --> 29:18.822
I don't know
what to tell you.

29:18.824 --> 29:21.291
   There's nothing
   I can do.

29:21.293 --> 29:23.327
        It's Christmas.
We're just trying to get home.

29:23.329 --> 29:25.863
     I don't see your name
and I don't have any more cars.

29:25.865 --> 29:27.231
         Sorry, folks.

29:27.233 --> 29:29.666
You got a ton of cars
in your lot!

29:29.668 --> 29:32.302
      It's Christmastime,
 the busiest time of the year.

29:32.304 --> 29:33.837
     They're all reserved.

29:33.839 --> 29:35.372
I hope you have a reservation.

29:37.476 --> 29:38.475
              No.

29:38.477 --> 29:39.910
  [dry chuckle]: Oh, ho, ho.

29:39.912 --> 29:42.513
    [mother]: I understand
   this isn't your problem,

29:42.515 --> 29:43.981
     but it's our problem.

29:43.983 --> 29:45.182
       We're stuck here
   with all of these gifts--

29:45.184 --> 29:46.250
              Hi.

29:46.252 --> 29:47.785
           Hi there.

29:47.787 --> 29:49.620
     I like your earrings.

29:49.622 --> 29:51.755
                  Oh, thank you.

29:51.757 --> 29:53.891
                My name is Sara.
                What's yours?

29:53.893 --> 29:55.626
        Amy.

29:55.628 --> 29:58.295
   Amy? Well, it's very nice
         to meet you.

29:58.297 --> 30:00.898
  Nice to meet you too, Sara.

30:02.301 --> 30:03.767
  We're gonna miss Christmas.

30:03.769 --> 30:05.803
       Santa won't know
       where to find me.

30:05.805 --> 30:07.437
 You're gonna miss Christmas?

30:07.439 --> 30:09.173
    [Hank]: ...Try to call
     our reservation line,

30:09.175 --> 30:10.774
            and see
  if they can deliver a car.

30:10.776 --> 30:12.943
Something like that, but I c--
I can't handle that right now.

30:12.945 --> 30:13.944
    I got my own problems.

30:13.946 --> 30:15.813
      Excuse me. "Hank"?

30:15.815 --> 30:17.748
That's the name.

30:17.750 --> 30:19.183
   Sara, we really have to--

30:19.185 --> 30:21.185
        You do realize
    that it's Christmas Eve

30:21.187 --> 30:22.586
    tomorrow night, right?

30:22.588 --> 30:23.821
Mm-hmm.

30:23.823 --> 30:25.455
     And you see you have
    this little girl here?

30:25.457 --> 30:28.692
     Wouldn't you like her
   to be home for Christmas?

30:28.694 --> 30:30.761
        You know, so...
[whispers] Santa can find her?

30:33.599 --> 30:35.265
 I have rules to follow, Miss.

30:35.267 --> 30:36.533
                I'm sure you do,

30:36.535 --> 30:39.269
    but those rules can be bent,
          just a little...

30:39.271 --> 30:40.771
        just this once.

30:40.773 --> 30:43.707
             [♪♪♪]

30:43.709 --> 30:45.709
        Please, Mister?

30:45.711 --> 30:48.812
             [♪♪♪]

30:50.349 --> 30:52.616
           I mean...

30:52.618 --> 30:54.351
     I'll go get the keys.

30:54.353 --> 30:55.252
             Yay!

30:55.254 --> 30:58.388
That's the last
car, folks. Sorry.

30:58.390 --> 31:00.390
     Okay, let's go.

31:02.394 --> 31:03.961
I'm impressed.

31:03.963 --> 31:06.396
                       Honestly?
                       I am too.

31:07.399 --> 31:09.566
We really got to go.

31:23.115 --> 31:24.815
    I can't thank you guys
        enough, really.

31:24.817 --> 31:27.184
         You all set?

31:27.186 --> 31:28.185
     Yes, I think we are.

31:28.187 --> 31:29.419
Mm-hmm.

31:29.421 --> 31:30.687
      Really, you did not
    have to do that for us.

31:30.689 --> 31:31.989
  Of course. It's Christmas.

31:31.991 --> 31:34.524
    Everyone should be home
       for the holidays.

31:34.526 --> 31:36.393

      you guys gonna do?

31:36.395 --> 31:37.761

         Yeah, I know.

32:55.407 --> 32:57.741
  I-I realize that we're late.
Yeah, I explained what happened.

32:57.743 --> 33:01.645
We're literally right outside,
  we're, like, a minute away.

33:01.647 --> 33:03.914

                           What?

33:06.185 --> 33:07.351
Apparently, Mr. Taylor

33:07.353 --> 33:09.319
doesn't take too kindly
to people being late.

33:09.321 --> 33:11.421
       Apologize to them
  and tell them we appreciate

33:11.423 --> 33:13.423
the value of Mr. Taylor's time,
but we've come a very long way

33:13.425 --> 33:16.193

        Yeah. I can't--
    I can't tell her that.

       wild about that.

     Yeah, I'm just happy
 that our pitch is still a go.

      back there, it's--

     You saved the pitch.

Oh, hi. It's
a pleasure to meet you.

37:42.828 --> 37:44.694
 Oh, the pleasure's all mine.

37:44.696 --> 37:47.097
I can't believe you surprised us
         for Christmas.

37:47.099 --> 37:48.832
       Oh, no, it's just
       a business trip.

37:48.834 --> 37:50.867
    We can't stay, Lizzie.

37:50.869 --> 37:53.036
 Oh. Listen, I'm heading over
        to your folks'.

                 planned.

        in our family.

       on coming, right?

38:03.148 --> 38:04.914
   No, actually, we're not.

 But we'll do it another time.

    Yeah, I don't think so.

38:13.659 --> 38:15.625
Are you sure?
Because I think

38:15.627 --> 38:17.193
  it sounds like so much fun.

       Why don't we all
      just move on, yeah?

38:20.599 --> 38:24.100
          That's all
   we're asking for, Peter.

38:24.102 --> 38:26.169
    It's time to let it go.

38:27.339 --> 38:29.205
   That's not what I meant.

38:29.207 --> 38:30.840
          Not today.

        It's Christmas.

38:32.077 --> 38:33.310
     I think we should go.

38:33.312 --> 38:35.145
And you know what?
if you don't want to,

38:35.147 --> 38:36.579
     maybe I'll join you.

        Yes! Of course.
  You'd be more than welcome.

  Great! I love the holidays.

48:26.037 --> 48:27.536
 [Lizzie]: Here, toss this one
        up there, too.

48:27.538 --> 48:28.537
    I need it for the Inn.

48:28.539 --> 48:29.538
      [Peter]: Oh, okay.

48:29.540 --> 48:32.208
         Looks heavy!

48:32.210 --> 48:34.443
          Oh, it is!

48:34.445 --> 48:35.578
There we go.

48:35.580 --> 48:37.380
Can you pass me
the rope, Mom?

48:37.382 --> 48:40.383
  [grunts] There. Thank you.

48:40.385 --> 48:42.151
  Make sure they're on tight,
          sweetheart.

48:42.153 --> 48:45.321
 Oh, yeah. It's gonna be snug
  as a bug on Christmas Eve.

48:45.323 --> 48:47.490
      Okay, I'm gonna go
   pay for the tree, honey.

48:47.492 --> 48:50.359
Oh, wait for me.
I need to pay, too.

48:50.361 --> 48:51.928
   Here, throw me the rope.

48:51.930 --> 48:53.896
      Oh, no, it's okay.
    I can get it from here.

48:53.898 --> 48:55.865
             No. Throw it to me.

48:55.867 --> 48:58.868
    I was a Girl Scout for
 seven consecutive years, so,

48:58.870 --> 49:00.036
      throw me the rope.

49:00.038 --> 49:02.071
Okay, you sound a little proud
          about that.

49:02.073 --> 49:04.173
        You know what?
  I am kind of proud of that.

49:04.175 --> 49:06.142
  And knots were my favorite,
             so...

49:08.112 --> 49:10.112
          Here we go.

49:13.384 --> 49:15.451
Uh, that's some
nice work there.

49:15.453 --> 49:16.452
           Oh! Ow...

49:16.454 --> 49:18.454
           You okay?

49:18.456 --> 49:20.623
 Nothing, nothing. It's fine.
         It's just a--

49:20.625 --> 49:22.224
   Let me take a look at it.

49:22.226 --> 49:23.359
            No, no.
   It's just a rope sliver.

49:23.361 --> 49:24.360
          It's fine.

49:26.431 --> 49:28.965
   It's just a rope sliver.
     It's not a big deal.

49:28.967 --> 49:30.933
Let me see.
Let me see.

49:30.935 --> 49:34.236
Our top Girl Scout
has got herself

49:34.238 --> 49:35.438
a rope silver,
ladies and gentlemen.

49:35.440 --> 49:37.039
       -Don't. [laughs]
          -I'm sorry.

49:37.041 --> 49:38.040
      Just kidding.

49:38.042 --> 49:40.409
I know, these things
can be the worst.

49:40.411 --> 49:42.111
Especially if it--
Oh, here it is!

49:44.115 --> 49:45.147
            Oh. Ow!

49:46.284 --> 49:47.283
I got it.

49:47.285 --> 49:48.417
         Did you get it?

49:48.419 --> 49:49.385
Yeah.

49:49.387 --> 49:50.920
                You got it.

49:50.922 --> 49:52.188
            -Yeah.
        -Well, thanks.

49:52.190 --> 49:53.656
What can I say?

49:53.658 --> 49:55.658
       I was a Boy Scout
  for seven consecutive years

49:55.660 --> 49:59.061
    and rope-sliver-pulling
  was kind of my "thing," so.

49:59.063 --> 50:00.329
   [laughs] Well, thank you.

50:00.331 --> 50:02.164
     You saved my finger.

50:02.166 --> 50:04.433
  Well, if it happens again,
  you know where to find me.

50:04.435 --> 50:06.035
    I'll be here at least--

50:06.037 --> 50:09.672
well, we're here on this trip,
like tonight, I mean, together.

50:09.674 --> 50:10.973
     I know what you mean.

50:10.975 --> 50:12.074
                           Yeah.

50:12.076 --> 50:14.310
          [chuckling]

50:14.312 --> 50:16.545
               You know, I was--
               I was thinking,

50:16.547 --> 50:17.947
                that after this,

50:17.949 --> 50:19.915
      we should probably
   head back to the B-and-B,

50:19.917 --> 50:21.150
        and tomorrow's
       a pretty big day.

50:21.152 --> 50:22.985
  We got a lot riding on it.

50:22.987 --> 50:24.620
We should probably get to work.

50:24.622 --> 50:26.522
   I'm ready for this pitch.

50:26.524 --> 50:28.991
  I mean, this proposal is...

50:28.993 --> 50:30.226
         it's my life,

50:30.228 --> 50:32.495
    and keeping the spirit
      of Christmas alive

50:32.497 --> 50:34.030
does not involve
going back

50:34.032 --> 50:36.198
and sitting
in a hotel room.

50:36.200 --> 50:37.666
    In fact, you know what?

50:37.668 --> 50:40.603
   I think you need a little
Christmas-101-spirit training.

50:40.605 --> 50:42.171
           Oh, yeah?

50:42.173 --> 50:43.372
             Yeah.

50:43.374 --> 50:46.042
         You're really
     that into Christmas?

50:46.044 --> 50:47.610
    What's not to be into?

50:47.612 --> 50:49.512
  Christmas 365 spawned from

50:49.514 --> 50:52.415
me wanting to decorate earlier
than the department stores do.

50:52.417 --> 50:53.549
               How much earlier?

50:53.551 --> 50:55.084
    Like before Halloween?

50:55.086 --> 50:57.987
Oh, I would say before Easter,
      if it was up to me.

50:57.989 --> 50:59.288
          [laughing]

50:59.290 --> 51:00.990
But, the more I started
developing it,

51:00.992 --> 51:03.259
   I realized it's not just
      about decorations,

51:03.261 --> 51:05.528
   it's-it's about feeling.

51:05.530 --> 51:07.730
         Feeling what?

51:07.732 --> 51:11.267
    What other time of year
    is as magical as this?

51:11.269 --> 51:13.502
Really.

51:13.504 --> 51:15.004
I mean, people go

51:15.006 --> 51:16.505
       out of their way
      to help each other.

51:16.507 --> 51:19.542
  It's the season of giving.

51:22.380 --> 51:25.014
 I mean, why can't we all feel
        a little love,

51:25.016 --> 51:27.516
       365 days a year?

51:29.153 --> 51:31.153

             [♪♪♪]

51:50.074 --> 51:51.841
Aw, are you sure
you can't stay?

51:51.843 --> 51:53.409
We got lots of room.

51:53.411 --> 51:56.011
   I know, Mom, but Lizzie's
   got two beautiful rooms,

51:56.013 --> 51:57.113
       all set up for us
          at the Inn.

51:57.115 --> 51:58.981
Oh, make sure
that you take her

51:58.983 --> 52:00.883
            on the full tour,
            because the downtown

52:00.885 --> 52:02.384
          is so beautiful
          this time of the year.

52:02.386 --> 52:04.019
     [Peter]: Are you sure
 you're okay with us walking?

52:04.021 --> 52:05.020
     You don't need help?

52:05.022 --> 52:06.222
  I mean, you have two trees.

52:06.224 --> 52:07.857
                     Don't worry
                     about it.

52:07.859 --> 52:09.592
      I'm a professional
   Christmas tree-wrangler.

52:11.362 --> 52:13.929
                We'll see you
                back at the inn.

52:18.102 --> 52:20.402
    Ah, I love you, honey.

52:20.404 --> 52:23.272
I just wish you and your father
      would find a way--

52:23.274 --> 52:24.373
                     Mom, don't.

52:25.510 --> 52:27.409
       It is what it is

52:27.411 --> 52:30.980
    and I would rather not
        talk about it.

52:30.982 --> 52:33.949
        Just remember,
   nobody's perfect, Peter.

52:33.951 --> 52:36.318
    Not me, not you,
    not your Dad.

52:37.522 --> 52:40.122
If only you knew
how alike you two are.

52:40.124 --> 52:41.223
     This stubbornness...

52:41.225 --> 52:42.224
                            Mom.

52:42.226 --> 52:43.092
             Okay.

52:45.096 --> 52:46.629
It was lovely
to meet you.

52:46.631 --> 52:48.931
Thank you for
taking care of my son.

52:48.933 --> 52:50.032
     You are very welcome.

52:50.034 --> 52:52.034
        It was so nice
         to meet you.

52:53.638 --> 52:55.905

      Bye, Mom. Love you.

53:23.568 --> 53:24.567
         Are you okay?

53:27.138 --> 53:28.938
       Yeah, yeah, I'm--

53:28.940 --> 53:31.340
           I'm good.

53:31.342 --> 53:32.408
       Listen, I'm sorry
        if I pushed you

53:32.410 --> 53:35.277
 to go to your parents' house.

53:35.279 --> 53:38.480
       I understand now
that that wasn't easy for you.

53:39.984 --> 53:42.484
   You really are something.

53:46.190 --> 53:48.324
So are you gonna give me
a tour of the town, or what?

53:48.326 --> 53:51.026
             We've actually seen
             most of it, but...

53:51.028 --> 53:53.462
              we could walk down
              Main Street,

53:53.464 --> 53:55.531
               and it'll take us
               back to the inn.

53:55.533 --> 53:56.565
        All right.

53:56.567 --> 53:58.167
           Come on.

                     Here we go!

54:20.524 --> 54:21.390
              Ah!

54:22.727 --> 54:23.726
Go ahead.

54:23.728 --> 54:24.727
           [laughs]

54:26.097 --> 54:28.430

             [♪♪♪]

54:33.404 --> 54:35.237
                     You know...

54:35.239 --> 54:37.373
            I thought a lot
            about what you said,

54:37.375 --> 54:40.409
                about the spirit
                of Christmas.

54:40.411 --> 54:43.512
           And when I was a kid,

54:43.514 --> 54:47.016
                I mean,
                I just loved it.

54:48.152 --> 54:50.753
             I mean,
             Christmas was about

54:50.755 --> 54:54.189
               wishes that
               always came true,

54:54.191 --> 54:55.157
      and there's nothing better

54:55.159 --> 54:57.559
            than believing in
            the magic of it all.

54:57.561 --> 54:59.094
That's the best part.

54:59.096 --> 55:00.963
                 Right, but then
                 you get older,

55:00.965 --> 55:04.066
                  and the lines
                  begin to blur.

55:04.068 --> 55:05.234
                     And for me,

55:05.236 --> 55:07.002
                that's when
                the magic faded.

55:07.004 --> 55:08.470
     How so?

55:08.472 --> 55:09.838
                    Well, my dad

55:09.840 --> 55:14.510
  made me choose between him
      and what I wanted.

55:14.512 --> 55:17.279
                And when I chose
                what I wanted...

55:17.281 --> 55:20.316
         my wishes...

55:20.318 --> 55:23.218
  from my dad's perspective,

55:23.220 --> 55:26.055
        the magic died.

55:27.091 --> 55:29.391
      I don't understand.

55:32.063 --> 55:34.396
          It was when
 I dropped out of law school.

55:34.398 --> 55:39.635
     My dad had this dream of me
     joining him at his firm,

55:39.637 --> 55:43.439
      being his partner,
     living in this town.

55:43.441 --> 55:46.408
     It all sounded nice.

55:46.410 --> 55:50.045
   But the only problem was,
      that was his dream,

55:50.047 --> 55:51.547
           not mine.

55:51.549 --> 55:54.350
  And he took it pretty hard.

55:54.352 --> 55:55.384
            Well...

55:55.386 --> 55:57.386
        as you can see.

55:58.389 --> 56:00.155
            Sorry.

56:00.157 --> 56:02.825
     This pitch is one of
   the most important things

56:02.827 --> 56:06.362
    to happen to my company
    in a really long time.

56:06.364 --> 56:09.298
   It's your Christmas wish.

56:10.701 --> 56:12.768
          Yeah. Okay.

56:12.770 --> 56:15.337
                That's enough
                of me talking.

56:15.339 --> 56:17.339
          I think it's only fair

56:17.341 --> 56:20.309
              that I ask you
              about your life.

56:20.311 --> 56:22.611
Oh, sure, ask away.

56:22.613 --> 56:25.214
What would
you like to know?

56:25.216 --> 56:26.715
                   Well...

56:26.717 --> 56:30.219
          there's one thing that
          I was wondering about.

56:30.221 --> 56:32.488
                We've had
                a dozen meetings

56:32.490 --> 56:34.556
            over a couple years,

56:34.558 --> 56:37.693
           and you haven't said

56:53.310 --> 56:54.810
No, I'm serious.

56:54.812 --> 56:57.880
I guess I just
was really shy.

       you got over it.

    to speak up for myself.

01:00:06.003 --> 01:00:08.470

             that you can't take
             one day off?

 Well, the wheels of commerce

01:00:18.816 --> 01:00:20.782
             I mean, people
             shouldn't feel like

01:00:20.784 --> 01:00:22.451
                 their jobs
                 are on the line

01:00:22.453 --> 01:00:23.752
              if they don't want
              to work.

01:00:23.754 --> 01:00:26.254
         People's jobs
  would never be on the line.

01:00:26.256 --> 01:00:27.556
                 But do you
                 tell them that,

01:00:27.558 --> 01:00:28.657
               when you ask them
               to work?

01:00:28.659 --> 01:00:31.860
     That's a good point.
          I haven't.

01:00:31.862 --> 01:00:33.462
    But I will. Thank you.

01:00:33.464 --> 01:00:35.530
                 Good.

01:00:35.532 --> 01:00:37.766
For the record, though,

01:00:37.768 --> 01:00:39.835
I do pay them
time and a half.

01:00:39.837 --> 01:00:42.270
            Oh, time and a half.
            You don't say?

01:00:42.272 --> 01:00:44.373
      Oh, you don't think
         that's fair?

01:00:44.375 --> 01:00:45.440
             Well, now
             that you're asking,

01:00:45.442 --> 01:00:46.975
            I'm gonna tell you--
            no, I don't.

01:00:46.977 --> 01:00:48.310
         I think that you should

01:00:48.312 --> 01:00:49.544
                be paying them
                at least double.

01:00:49.546 --> 01:00:51.346
         And I also think
         you should do something

01:00:51.348 --> 01:00:52.414
           really nice for them,

01:00:52.416 --> 01:00:53.749
         like get them presents,

01:00:53.751 --> 01:00:56.418
     or, uh, or bring them
       Christmas dinner,

01:00:56.420 --> 01:00:57.819
you know, with holiday crackers,

01:00:57.821 --> 01:00:59.554
    like the little things
     that you crack open,

01:00:59.556 --> 01:01:00.622
   they have prizes inside?

01:01:00.624 --> 01:01:01.957
      Oh, and stockings,

01:01:01.959 --> 01:01:03.725
everyone should have a stocking
     that Santa can fill.

01:01:03.727 --> 01:01:05.460
        Anything else?

01:01:05.462 --> 01:01:07.362
 You should write their names
       on the stockings.

01:01:07.364 --> 01:01:09.464
That'd be a really nice touch.

01:01:09.466 --> 01:01:11.767

     supposed to do that?

01:01:11.769 --> 01:01:13.268

01:04:39.243 --> 01:04:41.142
    Honest truth?

01:04:41.144 --> 01:04:42.143
        I...

01:04:42.145 --> 01:04:44.279
I'm nervous,
but I'm confident.

01:04:44.281 --> 01:04:46.248
I mean, I'm ready.
I know I'm more than ready.

01:04:46.250 --> 01:04:48.583
        Well, perfect.
    Just stay focused on...

01:04:48.585 --> 01:04:51.086
 I've also never done anything
       like this before

01:04:51.088 --> 01:04:54.189
and I know we have
a lot riding on it.

01:04:55.259 --> 01:04:57.359
          And I don't
    want to disappoint you.

01:04:57.361 --> 01:04:59.060
         I don't want
     to disappoint myself.

01:04:59.062 --> 01:05:01.396
            Listen.

01:05:01.398 --> 01:05:04.566
       I'm nervous, too.
I mean, who wouldn't be, right?

01:05:06.236 --> 01:05:08.103
                          And...

01:05:08.105 --> 01:05:10.639
         I don't want to
         disappoint you, either.

01:05:11.642 --> 01:05:14.242
       Just be yourself.

01:05:16.113 --> 01:05:18.747
Maybe not quite as bold, but...

01:05:20.183 --> 01:05:22.651
    [laughing] Great.

01:05:24.187 --> 01:05:26.054
         We got this.

01:05:26.056 --> 01:05:28.490
         Thanks.

01:05:28.492 --> 01:05:31.459
             [♪♪♪]

01:05:35.165 --> 01:05:37.299
   So, the thing to remember

01:05:37.301 --> 01:05:42.370
is don't take anything this guy
   says or does personally.

01:05:42.372 --> 01:05:43.438
                 I can't believe

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:45.640
            he has us waiting
            outside in the snow.

01:05:45.642 --> 01:05:47.108
      [chuckles] I know.

01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:49.177
        The stories of
 how difficult this guy can be

01:05:49.179 --> 01:05:50.712
        are legendary.

01:05:50.714 --> 01:05:54.015
      It's just his way.
    Don't let it throw you.

01:05:55.285 --> 01:05:57.686
     The work that you did
        on this pitch,

01:05:57.688 --> 01:05:59.321
     it speaks for itself.

01:05:59.323 --> 01:06:01.356
      You've got nothing
        to worry about.

01:06:01.358 --> 01:06:02.724
                 Thanks.

01:06:02.726 --> 01:06:04.259
So, how about
we get in there,

01:06:04.261 --> 01:06:07.062
I do the introductions,
let you get set up?

01:06:07.064 --> 01:06:08.663
And then, when
I give you the sign,

01:06:08.665 --> 01:06:10.665
       go for it.

01:06:10.667 --> 01:06:13.735
              Okay. So just
              wait for the sign,

01:06:13.737 --> 01:06:15.704
                  and go for it.
                  Great.

01:06:15.706 --> 01:06:19.107
          Oh, one thing, though.
          What is the sign?

01:06:19.109 --> 01:06:20.608
   [laughs]
   How about, um...

01:06:20.610 --> 01:06:23.211
   "Sara, you take it
   from here"?

01:06:23.213 --> 01:06:25.246
         Just "Sara,
         you take it from here"?

01:06:25.248 --> 01:06:26.581
       Mm-hmm.

01:06:26.583 --> 01:06:28.616
            Okay. Yeah.
            I can remember that.

01:06:30.354 --> 01:06:31.720
      He's ready for you.

01:06:33.156 --> 01:06:34.756
[exhales deeply]

01:06:36.259 --> 01:06:37.692
                    Okay.

01:06:37.694 --> 01:06:39.260
           Tell her

01:06:39.262 --> 01:06:41.529
  she's completely authorized
   to disburse those funds.

01:06:41.531 --> 01:06:43.398
It's in the memo from last week.

01:06:43.400 --> 01:06:44.499
      She should have it.

01:06:46.737 --> 01:06:50.105
 I put that in an email blast
       a long time ago.

01:06:50.107 --> 01:06:52.607
  That was our original plan,
      but you know that.

01:06:53.610 --> 01:06:55.610
      You'll get a copy.

01:06:55.612 --> 01:06:58.847
         Okay, thanks.
     I'll get back to you.

01:06:58.849 --> 01:07:01.449
             So...

01:07:01.451 --> 01:07:02.817
   let me get this straight.

01:07:02.819 --> 01:07:05.253
     I already saw a pitch
     that I signed off on,

01:07:05.255 --> 01:07:07.722
          and you two
        want to somehow

01:07:07.724 --> 01:07:08.723
          persuade me
    into changing my mind.

01:07:08.725 --> 01:07:09.724
     That about cover it?

01:07:09.726 --> 01:07:10.725
Mr. Taylor,

01:07:10.727 --> 01:07:11.760
  it's an honor to meet you.

01:07:11.762 --> 01:07:12.761
      I'm Peter Williams,

01:07:12.763 --> 01:07:13.862
and this
is my colleague, S--

01:07:13.864 --> 01:07:15.597
             No, no, no, no, no!
             Why don't you guys

01:07:15.599 --> 01:07:17.265
               just go ahead
               and grab a table?

01:07:17.267 --> 01:07:20.468
           Have a brief meeting.
           I'll be right there.

01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:22.103
          And order me
          a hot toddy, will you?

01:07:22.105 --> 01:07:23.405
               Make it a double.

01:07:25.542 --> 01:07:30.211
Okay, Peter Williams Marketing
     of Chicago, Illinois.

01:07:30.213 --> 01:07:33.148
You got two minutes. Amaze me.

01:07:33.150 --> 01:07:34.582
     Okay, well, thank you

01:07:34.584 --> 01:07:35.784
      for taking the time
       to meet with us.

01:07:35.786 --> 01:07:36.785
I think what you're gonna find--

01:07:36.787 --> 01:07:39.354
  Of course I want a window.

01:07:39.356 --> 01:07:40.622
   Why are you bothering me
          with this?

01:07:42.826 --> 01:07:46.127
     If that's your pitch,
      let's just hear it.

01:07:46.129 --> 01:07:47.162
       Clock's ticking.

01:07:48.231 --> 01:07:49.798
Great, um,
I was just waiting

01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:50.832
for my computer
to boot up,

01:07:54.571 --> 01:07:56.905
But, um, yeah,
I'll just get started.

01:07:56.907 --> 01:07:58.840
So when we were
looking at your account,

01:07:58.842 --> 01:08:00.308
it didn't take
long to realize--

01:08:00.310 --> 01:08:02.877
       Did you tell them
         that it's me?

01:08:02.879 --> 01:08:06.815
      We are not waiting
    20 minutes for a table!

01:08:06.817 --> 01:08:08.716
    You have them seat you
          right now,

01:08:08.718 --> 01:08:09.784
      unless they prefer

01:08:09.786 --> 01:08:11.152
         I take it up
     with Randall Walker,

01:08:11.154 --> 01:08:12.420
a close personal friend of mine

01:08:12.422 --> 01:08:15.256
       who just happens
      to own this place.

01:08:17.894 --> 01:08:20.662
 Let's just cut to the chase,
           shall we?

01:08:20.663 --> 01:08:24.765
Great, okay, well, it boils down
   to a campaign that we call

01:08:24.768 --> 01:08:26.701
       "Christmas 365."

01:08:26.703 --> 01:08:29.237
   It's about something more
      than just shopping.

01:08:29.238 --> 01:08:31.573
       It's about having
    the spirit of Christmas

01:08:31.575 --> 01:08:33.541
         in your heart
    every day of the year.

01:08:33.542 --> 01:08:35.243
      Now you're talking.

01:08:35.245 --> 01:08:36.578
          [chuckles]

01:08:36.580 --> 01:08:38.513
   Sit tight, I'm on my way.

01:08:40.283 --> 01:08:42.517
May I continue?

01:08:42.519 --> 01:08:44.452
  This gonna be much longer,
          sweetheart?

01:08:44.453 --> 01:08:46.354
<i> Sweetheart?</i>

01:08:46.356 --> 01:08:48.256
"Sweetheart." That's...

01:08:49.292 --> 01:08:52.493
             [♪♪♪]

01:08:52.496 --> 01:08:53.661
Wow.

01:08:53.662 --> 01:08:54.662
You do know

01:08:54.663 --> 01:08:56.564
that we came
all the way from Chicago

01:08:56.566 --> 01:08:57.564
just to see you?

01:08:57.567 --> 01:08:59.767
We traveled very far
out of our way

01:08:59.769 --> 01:09:01.469
to have this meeting,
and the least you could do

01:09:01.470 --> 01:09:02.504
is treat us with
a little respect.

01:09:02.506 --> 01:09:03.904
        Careful, missy.

01:09:03.907 --> 01:09:05.773
        You're treading
       on thin ice here.

01:09:05.774 --> 01:09:07.408
 Why would you even say that?

01:09:07.410 --> 01:09:08.743
     It's patently obvious

01:09:08.745 --> 01:09:10.812
     you have no interest
  in anything we have to say.

01:09:10.814 --> 01:09:12.212
               You know, I think
               what we could do

01:09:12.215 --> 01:09:13.648
            is just take it back
            a couple steps and--

01:09:13.649 --> 01:09:15.483
Any pitch about
the spirit of Christmas

01:09:15.484 --> 01:09:16.850
is clearly wasted on you.

01:09:16.853 --> 01:09:19.354
          Very well.
     This meeting's over.

01:09:19.356 --> 01:09:20.388
[scoffing]: Over?

01:09:20.390 --> 01:09:22.423
[laughs] That's just...
kind of hilarious,

01:09:22.425 --> 01:09:25.960
because you actually never even
  let us get started, but...

01:09:25.962 --> 01:09:27.761
      And you know what?
    It's actually too bad,

01:09:27.764 --> 01:09:29.464
   because someone like you
     could really benefit

01:09:29.466 --> 01:09:30.865
from a little
Christmas spirit.

01:09:30.867 --> 01:09:32.267
But that's okay.

01:09:32.269 --> 01:09:34.502
    Because we'll just take
"Christmas 365" somewhere else,

01:09:34.504 --> 01:09:36.404
and we'll infuse
their brand with

01:09:36.406 --> 01:09:38.305
     the spirit of giving
   and community year-long,

01:09:38.308 --> 01:09:39.741
      and you know what?
 When their sales skyrocket--

01:09:39.743 --> 01:09:41.042
       which they will--

01:09:41.044 --> 01:09:42.710
      because, you know,
"give and you shall receive"--

01:09:42.712 --> 01:09:44.379
         you'll still
     just be sitting here,

01:09:44.381 --> 01:09:46.381
 talking to your little buddy
     on your little thing,

01:09:46.383 --> 01:09:49.317
 wondering how you could have
possibly treated me like this.

01:09:49.319 --> 01:09:51.419
Is there anything
you want to add?

01:09:51.421 --> 01:09:54.889
                No. That
                about covers it.

01:09:56.293 --> 01:09:58.893
               I mean, can you
               believe that guy?

01:09:58.895 --> 01:10:00.028
So when you said

01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:01.863
you'd never done
anything like this before,

01:10:01.865 --> 01:10:03.865
you weren't
exaggerating, were you?

01:10:03.867 --> 01:10:05.433
I mean, did I not
just give you

01:10:05.435 --> 01:10:06.868
a heads-up in there
with that guy?

01:10:06.870 --> 01:10:08.536
I could've sworn
I gave you a heads-up.

01:10:08.538 --> 01:10:10.838
                I know!
                And I-I'm sorry.

01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:12.440
         It just--
         I couldn't stop myself.

01:10:12.442 --> 01:10:13.808
                   But that guy,

01:10:13.810 --> 01:10:14.776
           we were never
           gonna close with him.

01:10:14.778 --> 01:10:15.910
                 I'm sure of it.

01:10:15.912 --> 01:10:18.012
     We'll never know now,
           will we?

01:10:18.014 --> 01:10:20.281
      He was on his phone
    the entire time, Peter.

01:10:20.283 --> 01:10:21.916
What does that have
to do anything?

01:10:21.918 --> 01:10:24.652
That is what guys like that do,
        they multitask.

01:10:24.654 --> 01:10:25.887
            Okay, but that--

01:10:25.889 --> 01:10:28.356
And I told you, this man
is notoriously difficult.

01:10:28.358 --> 01:10:30.658
         I told you--
  do not take it personally.

01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:32.894
How was I not supposed
to take that personally?

01:10:32.896 --> 01:10:33.995
           That guy doesn't even
           know who you are.

01:10:33.997 --> 01:10:36.064
            I doubt that he even
            knows your name,

01:10:36.066 --> 01:10:37.665
and even if he did,
so what?

01:10:37.667 --> 01:10:40.435
  He called me "sweetheart."
     It was disrespectful.

01:10:41.471 --> 01:10:42.937
    We needed that account.

01:10:44.074 --> 01:10:45.773
      I'm aware of that.

01:10:45.775 --> 01:10:47.675
The only thing
that mattered here,

01:10:47.677 --> 01:10:49.043
        the only thing,

01:10:49.045 --> 01:10:50.545
   was landing that account.

01:10:50.547 --> 01:10:52.080
And if that meant

01:10:52.082 --> 01:10:53.548
putting up
with Mr. Taylor

            I care.

01:10:57.087 --> 01:10:58.753
  Because I don't want to be
       treated like I...

01:10:58.755 --> 01:11:00.588
 like I'm some sort of idiot,

01:11:00.590 --> 01:11:01.656
     like I don't matter.

01:11:01.658 --> 01:11:03.057

        be our friend.

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:13.601
     Okay, um. I'm sorry.
      Just let me go in.

01:11:13.603 --> 01:11:15.336
    -No, no, no, no. Uh-uh.
      -I can talk to him.

01:11:15.338 --> 01:11:16.537
    That is not happening.

01:11:16.539 --> 01:11:17.839

01:11:37.227 --> 01:11:39.093

You are gonna miss your flight.

01:13:32.709 --> 01:13:34.075

01:13:34.077 --> 01:13:35.877

 this is gonna sound strange,

you're talking about, actually.

                 the wrong foot,

01:15:04.467 --> 01:15:06.467

            that Mr. Taylor

                acted that way.

01:15:26.155 --> 01:15:27.221
               we weren't even
               given a fair shot

01:19:20.857 --> 01:19:24.759
     Or so I've been told.

01:19:24.761 --> 01:19:27.228
  Really looks like you found
    your Christmas spirit.

01:19:27.230 --> 01:19:28.295
Can you stay?

01:19:28.297 --> 01:19:30.331
You're more than
welcome.

01:19:30.333 --> 01:19:32.166
Even though you are
a Packers girl.

01:19:32.168 --> 01:19:33.734
               [laughing]

01:19:33.736 --> 01:19:36.070
          Thank you,
  but I actually can't stay.

01:19:36.072 --> 01:19:39.106
    I just... I just wanted
       to give you this.

01:19:41.811 --> 01:19:43.978
 And wish you Merry Christmas.

01:19:45.148 --> 01:19:46.347
                Merry Christmas,
                you guys.

01:19:47.884 --> 01:19:50.684
             [♪♪♪]

01:20:02.231 --> 01:20:04.698
             [♪♪♪]

01:20:09.372 --> 01:20:10.971
            You...

01:20:10.973 --> 01:20:13.741
          you closed
  the Wilson Taylor account?

01:20:13.743 --> 01:20:15.743
  Wow. I mean, I'm impressed.

01:20:15.745 --> 01:20:18.913
         I'm not sure
       I want it, but...

01:20:18.915 --> 01:20:20.714
        I'm impressed.

01:20:20.716 --> 01:20:22.249
    Of course you want it.

01:20:22.251 --> 01:20:25.653
         You need it.
 And jobs are depending on it.

01:20:25.655 --> 01:20:28.022
    And he's just a client.

01:20:28.024 --> 01:20:29.323
     He doesn't have to be
         your friend.

01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:33.861
And surprisingly, you might
actually come to like him.

01:20:33.863 --> 01:20:37.364
   You just have to kind of
  tell him who's boss first.

01:20:37.366 --> 01:20:41.936
I, uh, I should let you get back
  upstairs to your celebration.

01:20:43.005 --> 01:20:45.406
             Sara?

01:20:47.710 --> 01:20:50.144
   You really are something.

01:20:50.146 --> 01:20:51.846
        You know that?

01:20:51.848 --> 01:20:53.180
   You've said that before,

01:20:53.182 --> 01:20:57.718
    but I'm... I'm not sure
 if it's a good thing or not.

01:20:57.720 --> 01:21:00.888
       I can assure you,
      it's a good thing.

01:21:02.758 --> 01:21:06.060
        Well, I, um...

01:21:06.062 --> 01:21:07.428
         I should go.

01:21:07.430 --> 01:21:09.430
Get back to my mom and sister,
       they're waiting.

01:21:09.432 --> 01:21:10.831
What if I told you

01:21:10.833 --> 01:21:13.367
     I wanted you to stay?

01:21:13.369 --> 01:21:16.470
       Even if it's just
      for a little while?

01:21:16.472 --> 01:21:19.073
       I would tell you
        I'd like that.

01:21:19.075 --> 01:21:21.709
   I'd like that very much.

01:21:23.713 --> 01:21:26.013
But I have to be back by 8:00.

01:21:26.015 --> 01:21:27.815
        10:00?

01:21:27.817 --> 01:21:29.750
     Don't push your luck.

01:21:29.752 --> 01:21:31.886

             [♪♪♪]

01:22:28.945 --> 01:22:29.977
   Yeah...

01:22:31.213 --> 01:22:33.113
  It's perfect.

01:22:33.115 --> 01:22:35.082
