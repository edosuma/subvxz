WEBVTT

00:01.668 --> 00:03.086
<i>LAST WEEK ON</i> WINGS:

00:03.169 --> 00:05.922
I SAW YOUR EX-WIFE.

00:06.005 --> 00:08.591
CAROL'S VISITING BOSTON
ON HER WAY TO LONDON.

00:08.675 --> 00:09.426
WHAT?

00:09.509 --> 00:11.136
I'VE GOT TO REACH CAROL.

00:11.219 --> 00:13.805
{\an1}THIS MIGHT BE MY LAST CHANCE
TO WIN HER BACK.

00:13.888 --> 00:15.432
THE MESSAGE IS

00:15.515 --> 00:19.102
"MEET ME AT THE TOP
OF THE PRUDENTIAL BUILDING

00:19.185 --> 00:20.770
TONIGHT, 8:00."

00:20.854 --> 00:22.731
SOMEBODY'S TRYING
TO TAKE OFF.

00:22.814 --> 00:24.274
MY IDIOT BROTHER.

00:24.357 --> 00:26.776
{\an1}I KNOW YOU'RE UPSET
I TOOK THE PLANE.

00:26.860 --> 00:29.112
{\an1}BUT I COULD NOT LET
THIS OPPORTUNITY

00:29.195 --> 00:30.780
TO SEE CAROL SLIP BY.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.782
SHE NEVER SHOWED.

00:32.866 --> 00:34.951
THESE ARE FOR YOU.

00:35.034 --> 00:36.745
CAROL GAVE THEM TO ME.

00:36.828 --> 00:37.620
AND SHE SAID?

00:37.704 --> 00:39.080
"IT HURTS

00:39.164 --> 00:40.790
BUT I HAVE TO MOVE ON."

00:40.874 --> 00:42.834
CAROL'S FINALLY GONE.

00:42.917 --> 00:44.377
(<i> elevator bell</i> )

00:47.046 --> 00:48.882
{\an4}CAROL?
CAROL?
CAROL?

01:56.783 --> 01:59.202
OH! CAROL.

01:59.285 --> 02:01.204
I KNEW YOU'D COME BACK.

02:01.287 --> 02:03.206
WELL, YOU'RE ONE UP ON ME.

02:03.289 --> 02:05.333
I HAD NO IDEA I'D BE HERE.

02:05.416 --> 02:07.710
THAT'S WHY I SENT
THE CAB DRIVER.

02:07.794 --> 02:09.378
YEAH, YEAH, LUTHER.

02:09.461 --> 02:10.547
GREAT GUY.

02:10.630 --> 02:12.173
I THINK WE'RE ENGAGED

02:12.257 --> 02:14.676
IF WE CAN GET PAST
THE RACIAL THING.

02:14.759 --> 02:17.554
HEY, HEY, BET YOU FEEL
PRETTY SILLY NOW.

02:17.637 --> 02:19.389
LOOK WHO SHOWED UP.

02:19.472 --> 02:23.059
GEE, JOE, THIS IS
AN UNEXPECTEDLY...

02:23.143 --> 02:24.769
AWKWARD MOMENT.

02:24.853 --> 02:26.729
BUT THANK GOD
IT'S UNCOMFORTABLE.

02:26.813 --> 02:28.314
YEAH.

02:28.398 --> 02:30.984
{\an1}I'M HERE BECAUSE I THOUGHT
YOU WOULDN'T BE.

02:31.067 --> 02:33.236
I FIGURED BRIAN
MIGHT NEED SOMEONE

02:33.319 --> 02:35.196
TO HELP HIM GET HOME OKAY.

02:35.280 --> 02:38.825
{\an3}ONCE A CROSSING GUARD,
ALWAYS A CROSSING GUARD.

02:38.908 --> 02:41.578
WELL, WELL, CAROL.

02:41.661 --> 02:45.248
{\an1}I GUESS I'M THE LAST PERSON
YOU EXPECTED TO SEE HERE.

02:45.331 --> 02:47.292
DO WE KNOW EACH OTHER?

02:47.375 --> 02:49.043
I'M HELEN CHAPPEL.

02:49.127 --> 02:50.795
I'M SORRY.

02:50.879 --> 02:54.048
OH, PLEASE DON'T TELL ME
YOU DON'T KNOW WHO I AM.

02:54.132 --> 02:55.425
THAT'S RIGHT.

02:55.508 --> 02:58.595
{\an1}LAST TIME YOU SAW ME,
I WAS A LITTLE OVERWEIGHT.

02:58.678 --> 03:00.430
I'M TRYING TO PLACE YOU...

03:00.513 --> 03:02.765
{\an1}YOU CALLED ME
"FAT, FAT, THE WATER RAT."

03:02.849 --> 03:04.100
SHE DOESN'T...

03:04.183 --> 03:06.102
WE WENT TO SCHOOL
FOR EIGHT YEARS.

03:06.185 --> 03:08.062
LET'S LOOK OUT THESE WINDOWS.

03:08.146 --> 03:10.315
I SAT NEXT TO YOU
IN FOURTH GRADE.

03:10.398 --> 03:11.608
I'D DO YOUR HOMEWORK.

03:11.691 --> 03:13.484
YOU'D GIVE ME YOUR LUNCH.

03:13.568 --> 03:14.903
I... I...

03:14.986 --> 03:17.488
{\an3}I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE HERE.

03:17.572 --> 03:19.240
UM... CAROL

03:19.324 --> 03:21.159
THIS TIME
WE'LL MAKE IT WORK.

03:21.242 --> 03:22.660
NO, REALLY, AND I...

03:22.744 --> 03:24.287
BRIAN, BRIAN...

03:24.370 --> 03:27.165
{\an1}BEFORE YOU GO JUMPING
TO ANY CONCLUSIONS

03:27.248 --> 03:29.125
I'M STILL GOING TO LONDON.

03:29.208 --> 03:30.501
I'M JUST...

03:30.585 --> 03:32.003
I HAVE A JOB THERE.

03:32.086 --> 03:34.130
BUT WHEN I GOT ON THE PLANE

03:34.213 --> 03:37.091
I KEPT THINKING ABOUT
YOU HERE BY YOURSELF.

03:37.175 --> 03:40.261
{\an1}YOU'RE FORGETTING LUTHER
AND WHAT WE HAVE TOGETHER.

03:40.345 --> 03:43.640
YOU HAD NO WAY OF KNOWING
I'D EVEN GET YOUR MESSAGE.

03:43.723 --> 03:45.308
BUT I KNEW YOU'D BE HERE.

03:45.391 --> 03:47.810
{\an1}I COULDN'T IGNORE
A GESTURE LIKE THAT.

03:47.894 --> 03:50.480
WHAT ABOUT <i> YOUR</i> GESTURE?

03:50.563 --> 03:52.315
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

03:52.398 --> 03:55.526
{\an3}FLYING TO LONDON FROM MIAMI,
STOPPING IN BOSTON?

03:55.610 --> 03:57.946
THAT'S NOT EXACTLY
A DIRECT FLIGHT.

03:58.029 --> 04:00.949
WHY ELSE WOULD YOU COME
OTHER THAN TO SEE ME?

04:01.032 --> 04:02.784
TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO MY PARENTS?

04:02.867 --> 04:04.285
OH...

04:04.369 --> 04:06.162
HEY, DO THEY STILL HAVE

04:06.245 --> 04:08.998
THAT THREE-LEGGED
BLIND CHIHUAHUA?

04:09.082 --> 04:10.750
LUCKY? YEAH.

04:12.418 --> 04:15.088
{\an1}WELL, LOOK, BRIAN,
I BETTER GO.

04:15.171 --> 04:18.257
{\an1}I THINK I CAN STILL CATCH
THE LATE FLIGHT.

04:30.228 --> 04:33.272
OH...

04:33.356 --> 04:35.149
OOH...

04:35.233 --> 04:38.027
WE SHOULD HAVE KISSED
LIKE THAT MORE OFTEN.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.697
GUESS I WAS ALWAYS
TOO BUSY TRYING

04:40.780 --> 04:42.407
TO SWALLOW YOUR TONSILS.

04:42.490 --> 04:45.368
YOU GOT TO COME BACK
TO NANTUCKET WITH ME.

04:45.451 --> 04:47.662
I'M NOT LOOKING
FOR A COMMITMENT

04:47.745 --> 04:49.664
JUST GIVE IT
40 OR 50 YEARS.

04:49.747 --> 04:51.332
IF THINGS DON'T WORK OUT

04:51.416 --> 04:53.334
I'LL POP YOUR TEETH
BACK IN

04:53.418 --> 04:54.877
AND OFF YOU GO.

04:57.797 --> 05:01.592
WELL, MAYBE IT'S WORTH
A TRY.

05:01.676 --> 05:02.760
(<i> excited squeal</i> )

05:02.844 --> 05:04.512
OKAY.

05:04.595 --> 05:06.097
(<i> chuckles</i> )

05:10.601 --> 05:12.145
HEY, GUYS

05:12.228 --> 05:15.940
CAROL IS COMING BACK
TO THE ISLAND WITH US.

05:16.024 --> 05:17.567
NO KIDDING.

05:17.650 --> 05:20.361
ISN'T THAT GREAT.

05:20.445 --> 05:23.865
{\an1}YOUR FATHER USED TO RUN
THAT ICE CREAM PARLOR, RIGHT?

05:23.948 --> 05:24.866
YES, BUT...

05:24.949 --> 05:26.617
THAT WAS MY SECOND HOME.

05:26.701 --> 05:30.413
I KNOW I ONLY OVEREAT BECAUSE
I'M NERVOUS ABOUT SOMETHING.

05:30.496 --> 05:31.289
{\an3}HELEN...

05:31.372 --> 05:33.124
YOU PUSHED ME DOWN

05:33.207 --> 05:35.585
{\an1}BECAUSE I SPILLED HOT FUDGE
ON YOUR DRESS.

05:35.668 --> 05:37.545
GIVE IT UP, HELEN.

05:37.628 --> 05:38.713
I'M HUNGRY.

05:38.796 --> 05:40.339
IS ANYBODY HUNGRY?

05:44.177 --> 05:47.263
HAVEN'T YOU GOT ANYTHING
TO EAT BACK HERE?

05:47.346 --> 05:49.932
SOME PEANUTS
OR SOME CRACKERS OR...

05:50.016 --> 05:52.226
IT'S ONLY A 40-MINUTE
FLIGHT.

05:52.310 --> 05:55.104
MAYBE ONE OF THOSE
PRE-MOISTENED TOWELETTES.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.106
YOU KNOW,
WITH THE LEMON SCENT.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.150
I COULD JUST SORT OF SUCK
ON IT.

05:59.233 --> 06:01.736
{\an1}OH, WOULD YOU LOOK
AT THAT MOON.

06:01.819 --> 06:03.488
ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL?

06:03.571 --> 06:05.448
AH, WELL, WELL, WELL

06:05.531 --> 06:08.618
WOULD YOU LOOK
AT THE THREE OF US.

06:08.701 --> 06:10.995
THERE WAS A TIME
WHEN I DIDN'T THINK

06:11.079 --> 06:13.456
I'D SPEAK TO EITHER
OF YOU AGAIN.

06:13.539 --> 06:16.793
JOE, ABOUT THAT TIME
WHEN BRIAN AND I, UM...

06:16.876 --> 06:18.628
WELL, YOU KNOW...

06:18.711 --> 06:20.296
DUMPED ME AND RAN OFF?

06:20.379 --> 06:21.923
YOU DO REMEMBER.

06:22.006 --> 06:24.133
DON'T WORRY,
THAT WAS SIX YEARS AGO.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.052
I DON'T THINK ABOUT IT ANYMORE.

06:27.720 --> 06:31.641
WELL, CAN I SAY I'M SORRY?

06:31.724 --> 06:33.309
I THINK YOU JUST DID.

06:33.392 --> 06:34.811
I GUESS YOU'LL NEED

06:34.894 --> 06:36.312
A PLACE TO STAY.

06:36.395 --> 06:37.772
I'LL FIND A ROOM.

06:37.855 --> 06:39.482
YOU CAN MOVE IN WITH US.

06:39.565 --> 06:41.317
JOE CAN MOVE OUT
FOR A FEW DAYS.

06:41.400 --> 06:42.693
UH...

06:42.777 --> 06:45.196
I DON'T WANT
TO INCONVENIENCE ANYBODY.

06:45.279 --> 06:47.281
HELEN'S GOT
AN EXTRA BEDROOM.

06:47.365 --> 06:49.117
THAT'S OKAY, REALLY.

06:49.200 --> 06:52.453
{\an1}I FEEL A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE
STAYING WITH STRANGERS.

06:57.083 --> 06:59.168
THERE ARE PLENTY
OF GUEST HOUSES.

06:59.252 --> 07:00.628
I'LL BE FINE.

07:00.711 --> 07:02.088
YAY!

07:02.171 --> 07:04.465
HALF A PACKAGE
OF ROASTED ALMONDS.

07:04.549 --> 07:06.676
FOUND IT RIGHT
BETWEEN THE SEATS.

07:06.759 --> 07:07.927
HA!

07:13.683 --> 07:14.809
MORNING, HELEN.

07:14.892 --> 07:16.561
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE?

07:16.644 --> 07:19.021
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

07:19.105 --> 07:21.691
{\an1}LOOKS LIKE YOU CRUSHED UP
A BAG OF OREOS

07:21.774 --> 07:23.526
AND POURED MILK OVER THEM.

07:23.609 --> 07:27.697
I'M ALL OUT
OF OAT BRAN, OKAY?

07:27.780 --> 07:30.199
{\an1}ARE YOU UPSET
ABOUT SOMETHING?

07:30.283 --> 07:32.869
{\an1}I'M JUST TRYING
TO HAVE A LITTLE BREAKFAST

07:32.952 --> 07:35.204
AND IF HEAR ONE MORE WORD
OUT OF YOU

07:35.288 --> 07:37.832
AND I'M GOING TO CRAM
THIS FREAKING BOWL

07:37.915 --> 07:39.500
DOWN YOUR THROAT.

07:39.584 --> 07:42.044
YOU KNOW,
FOR A SECOND THERE

07:42.128 --> 07:45.006
SHE SOUNDED JUST LIKE
MY LATE WIFE.

07:47.592 --> 07:49.093
WHERE'S HELEN?

07:49.177 --> 07:52.555
{\an1}TRUST ME, LOWELL,
YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

07:52.638 --> 07:54.390
YES, I DO.

07:54.473 --> 07:58.728
I THINK IT'S ONE OF THOSE
"WOMAN" THINGS.

07:58.811 --> 08:01.230
GOD, I'M TIRED OF THOSE.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.232
<i>YOU'RE</i> TIRED OF THEM?

08:03.316 --> 08:04.734
YEAH.

08:04.817 --> 08:08.070
<i>YOU'RE</i> TIRED OF THOSE
"WOMAN" THINGS?

08:08.154 --> 08:10.364
ROY, ARE YOU TELLING ME

08:10.448 --> 08:14.243
THAT YOU'RE A WOMAN
DRESSED UP LIKE A MAN?

08:14.327 --> 08:17.079
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

08:17.163 --> 08:19.207
AND A HEARING LOSS TO BOOT.

08:19.290 --> 08:21.667
YOU'VE GOT A LOT
ON YOUR PLATE, MY FRIEND.

08:21.751 --> 08:24.921
ARE YOU STARK RAVING MAD?

08:25.004 --> 08:26.297
A FIERY WENCH.

08:26.380 --> 08:27.757
GUYS LOVE THAT.

08:27.840 --> 08:31.052
YOU STAY AWAY FROM ME.

08:31.135 --> 08:32.428
RELAX, ROY.

08:32.510 --> 08:34.096
MY WIFE WOULD KILL ME

08:34.179 --> 08:36.265
IF SHE CAUGHT ME
CHEATING ON HER.

08:36.349 --> 08:37.433
HEY, GUYS.

08:37.515 --> 08:39.268
BRIAN,
HOW WAS THE FLIGHT?

08:39.352 --> 08:41.770
{\an1}THE CONTROLS SEEMED
SLUGGISH AT FIRST

08:41.854 --> 08:44.941
BUT SOME FAT GUY FELL OUT
AND EVERYTHING WAS FINE.

08:45.024 --> 08:46.150
VERY FUNNY.

08:46.234 --> 08:49.487
{\an1}I PROMISED CAROL A PICNIC
AT ‘SCONSET LIGHT

08:49.570 --> 08:51.948
{\an1}BUT YOU GOT TO TAKE
MY NEXT FLIGHT.

08:52.031 --> 08:53.950
YOU GUYS ARE GETTING ALONG.

08:54.033 --> 08:55.743
OH, WE'RE DOING GREAT.

08:55.826 --> 08:57.662
YOU'LL DO IT, PLEASE?

08:57.745 --> 08:59.413
YEAH, SURE. WHY NOT?

08:59.497 --> 09:02.458
I JUST GOT TO DASH OUT
AND GET SOME GOODIES.

09:02.541 --> 09:04.126
BE BACK IN TEN MINUTES.

09:04.210 --> 09:05.211
I LOVE YOU.

09:07.838 --> 09:11.467
{\an1}I'VE GOT TO START PAYING
CLOSER ATTENTION AROUND HERE.

09:11.550 --> 09:14.929
{\an1}GOOD GOD, HELEN,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

09:15.012 --> 09:17.598
I'M HAVING A LITTLE SNACK.

09:17.682 --> 09:19.100
EVER SINCE CAROL CAME BACK

09:19.183 --> 09:21.644
YOU'VE DONE NOTHING
BUT EAT, EAT, EAT.

09:21.727 --> 09:23.646
HELEN, LOOK AT YOURSELF.

09:23.729 --> 09:26.023
{\an1}YOU'VE GOT PIE
ALL OVER YOUR FACE.

09:28.401 --> 09:29.986
OH, GOD.

09:30.069 --> 09:32.446
I'M LETTING THIS WOMAN
AFFECT ME.

09:32.530 --> 09:33.698
I'VE REVERTED

09:33.781 --> 09:36.492
TO MY OLD SELF-DESTRUCTIVE
EATING HABITS.

09:36.575 --> 09:37.868
TAKE THAT AWAY.

09:37.952 --> 09:39.203
GOOD FOR YOU.

09:39.287 --> 09:40.663
I DON'T WANT IT.

09:40.746 --> 09:42.331
I'M DONE PIGGING OUT.

09:42.415 --> 09:43.457
THANKS, JOE.

09:44.583 --> 09:46.627
LOWELL, DID YOU GET
THE PIZZA?

09:46.711 --> 09:48.170
IT'S IN THE PICKUP.

09:48.254 --> 09:49.630
WANT ME TO GET IT?

09:49.714 --> 09:51.465
BRING IT TO THE HANGAR.

09:51.549 --> 09:53.342
{\an3}THERE'S TOO MANY
PRYING EYES.

09:53.426 --> 09:54.802
RIGHT.

09:54.885 --> 09:56.512
AND DON'T LET JOE SEE YOU.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.180
DON'T WORRY ABOUT JOE.

09:58.264 --> 10:00.850
HE'S GOT OTHER THINGS
ON HIS MIND.

10:02.810 --> 10:04.312
(<i> knock on door</i> )

10:04.395 --> 10:06.480
AM I DISTURBING
ANYTHING?

10:06.564 --> 10:08.024
CAROL. NO, COME IN.

10:08.107 --> 10:10.359
I WAS STRAIGHTENING UP MY DESK.

10:10.443 --> 10:13.487
STILL NEAT AS A PIN, HUH?

10:13.571 --> 10:15.323
IN THE OLD DAYS

10:15.406 --> 10:19.076
{\an1}THAT STAPLER WOULD HAVE BEEN
AT A 90-DEGREE ANGLE.

10:19.160 --> 10:22.663
NOW IT'S ABOUT 82
AND IT DOESN'T BOTHER ME AT ALL.

10:25.499 --> 10:28.919
SO, UH, GOING ON A PICNIC, HUH?

10:29.003 --> 10:32.214
I HOPE ALL THIS HASN'T BEEN
TOO DIFFICULT FOR YOU.

10:32.298 --> 10:34.925
YOU MEAN, SEEING YOU
AND BRIAN TOGETHER?

10:35.009 --> 10:36.719
NO, NO, IT'S OKAY.

10:36.802 --> 10:38.512
I'M HAPPY FOR YOU TWO.

10:38.596 --> 10:39.972
IT TOOK ME A WHILE

10:40.056 --> 10:41.766
BUT I REALIZED IT WON'T WORK

10:41.849 --> 10:43.017
BETWEEN YOU AND ME...

10:44.852 --> 10:47.605
CAROL!

10:47.688 --> 10:48.814
{\an3}CAROL...

11:00.576 --> 11:02.286
NO! NO! NO!

11:02.370 --> 11:04.330
THIS CAN'T HAPPEN.

11:04.413 --> 11:05.748
YOU CAME FOR BRIAN.

11:05.831 --> 11:09.919
SUDDENLY, THESE FEELINGS
CAME WELLING UP INSIDE ME.

11:10.002 --> 11:11.712
I'M AS SURPRISED
AS YOU ARE.

11:11.796 --> 11:13.297
I DOUBT IT.

11:18.803 --> 11:21.555
{\an3}WE SHOULD BE ASHAMED
OF OURSELVES.

11:21.639 --> 11:24.266
BRIAN IS OUT BUYING
BREAD AND CHEESE

11:24.350 --> 11:28.062
AND, I DON'T KNOW, THOSE LITTLE
SMOKED OYSTERS, MAYBE...

11:28.145 --> 11:29.772
I DON'T LIKE SMOKED OYSTERS.

11:29.855 --> 11:30.940
DO YOU?

11:31.023 --> 11:33.401
WELL, IF YOU GET
THE RIGHT KIND...

11:38.072 --> 11:40.157
WE'VE GOT TO STOP THIS
RIGHT NOW

11:40.241 --> 11:42.034
BEFORE IT GOES ANY FURTHER.

11:42.118 --> 11:43.619
I COULDN'T AGREE MORE.

11:50.501 --> 11:52.670
WHAT AM I DOING?!

11:52.753 --> 11:55.673
JOE, STOP FEELING
SO GUILTY.

11:55.756 --> 11:58.759
I'M PARTLY
TO BLAME HERE, TOO.

11:58.843 --> 12:00.761
DON'T BE SO HARD ON YOURSELF.

12:00.845 --> 12:04.140
I'M SURE YOU JUST TRIPPED, FELL,
AND LANDED ON MY LIPS.

12:04.223 --> 12:05.641
I'M SORRY.

12:05.724 --> 12:07.309
YOU STILL ANGRY WITH ME?

12:07.393 --> 12:09.019
{\an3}FURIOUS.

12:09.770 --> 12:12.481
HEY, GUYS? GUYS?

12:12.565 --> 12:14.942
OUT HERE, BRIAN.

12:15.025 --> 12:17.528
HEY.

12:17.611 --> 12:20.114
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR DESK?

12:20.197 --> 12:21.490
{\an1}MY DESK?

12:21.574 --> 12:23.784
OH, I WAS JUST POLISHING IT.

12:23.868 --> 12:24.785
NICE AND SHINY.

12:24.869 --> 12:26.328
MOM WOULD HAVE BEEN PROUD.

12:26.412 --> 12:28.998
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

12:29.081 --> 12:30.166
HEY.

12:30.249 --> 12:32.001
HI, THERE.

12:32.084 --> 12:35.337
I GOT A CAN OF THOSE
LITTLE SMOKED OYSTERS.

12:35.421 --> 12:37.673
OOH, YUM-YUM.

12:37.756 --> 12:40.217
I WANT TO THANK YOU
FOR WHAT YOU DID.

12:40.301 --> 12:42.136
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

12:42.219 --> 12:44.472
COME ON, YOU TOOK
MY FLIGHT FOR ME.

12:44.555 --> 12:45.639
OH, THAT. RIGHT.

12:45.723 --> 12:46.640
YEAH, ANYTIME.

12:46.724 --> 12:48.017
WHICH REMINDS ME.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.311
I GOT TO GO DO
MY FLEE PRIGHT...

12:50.394 --> 12:51.353
MY FREE PLIGHT...

12:51.437 --> 12:53.856
I GOT TO GO.

12:53.939 --> 12:56.817
{\an1}HEY, CAROL, YOU'VE GOT
A PAPER CLIP ON YOUR BACK.

13:14.793 --> 13:16.879
GOOD NIGHT, JOE,
AND THANKS AGAIN

13:16.962 --> 13:19.423
{\an1}FOR LETTING ME WORK
AT SANDPIPER AIR.

13:19.507 --> 13:22.259
{\an1}YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY THAT
TO ME EVERY NIGHT.

13:22.343 --> 13:24.053
YOU GOT THE JOB.

13:24.136 --> 13:25.888
OH.

13:25.971 --> 13:29.016
{\an1}IN THAT CASE,
I'D LIKE A DENTAL PLAN.

13:31.310 --> 13:33.771
I'M KIDDING.

13:33.854 --> 13:35.564
{\an3}SORT OF.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.399
GOOD NIGHT.

13:38.692 --> 13:40.736
WELL, SHE'S ALL
LOCKED UP, JOE.

13:40.819 --> 13:43.239
{\an1}JUST CATCH THE FRONT DOOR
ON YOUR WAY OUT.

13:43.322 --> 13:45.241
OKAY, LOWELL. GOOD NIGHT.

13:45.324 --> 13:48.077
EVERYTHING OKAY, JOE?

13:48.160 --> 13:50.913
{\an1}WELL, ACTUALLY,
I'VE GOT A LITTLE PROBLEM.

13:50.996 --> 13:53.415
{\an1}BUT, HEY, EVERYONE
HAS PROBLEMS.

13:53.499 --> 13:55.251
NOT LIKE YOURS.

13:55.334 --> 13:59.255
{\an1}LISTEN, JOE, IF YOU AND BRIAN
WANT TO DATE EACH OTHER

13:59.338 --> 14:01.257
WELL, IT'S YOUR
OWN BUSINESS.

14:01.340 --> 14:04.426
BUT BEFORE YOU GIVE UP
ON THE FAIRER SEX

14:04.510 --> 14:05.761
GIVE ROY A CALL.

14:05.844 --> 14:09.765
{\an3}A NICER GAL
YOU WON'T FIND ANYWHERE.

14:18.190 --> 14:21.068
LOWELL JUST GAVE ME
A REALLY WEIRD LOOK.

14:21.151 --> 14:23.612
HOW COULD YOU TELL?

14:23.696 --> 14:26.448
{\an1}HEY, I THOUGHT YOU WENT
TO DINNER WITH CAROL.

14:26.532 --> 14:27.908
DROPPED HER OFF.

14:27.992 --> 14:30.452
SAID SHE DID SOMETHING
TO HER BACK TODAY.

14:30.536 --> 14:33.497
YEAH, THAT CAN HAPPEN.

14:33.581 --> 14:36.834
JOE, I WANT YOU TO KNOW
HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE

14:36.917 --> 14:39.795
{\an1}YOU BEING SUCH
A GREAT SPORT ABOUT ALL THIS.

14:39.878 --> 14:41.797
UH, BRIAN... LISTEN.

14:41.880 --> 14:44.633
THERE'S SOMETHING I GOT TO...

14:44.717 --> 14:47.303
IF CAROL AND I DO
GET BACK TOGETHER

14:47.386 --> 14:50.306
MAYBE WE COULD ADD A ROOM
ONTO THE HOUSE.

14:50.389 --> 14:52.099
BRIAN, LISTEN...

14:52.182 --> 14:55.269
WE'D HAVE TO MOVE ONCE
THE LITTLE ONES ARRIVE.

14:55.352 --> 14:56.604
BRIAN, PLEASE...

14:56.687 --> 14:58.480
WHAT ABOUT NAMES?

14:58.564 --> 15:00.816
I'M KIND OF PARTIAL
TO DORALDINE.

15:00.899 --> 15:03.360
{\an1}AH, BUT THERE WILL BE LIKE
SIX OTHER DORALDINES

15:03.444 --> 15:04.987
IN HER CLASS.

15:05.070 --> 15:08.449
{\an1}BRIAN, WOULD YOU SHUT UP
FOR GOD'S SAKE?

15:08.532 --> 15:12.995
{\an1}BRIAN... CAROL MADE A PASS
AT ME TODAY.

15:15.205 --> 15:16.957
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

15:17.041 --> 15:18.667
BRIAN, IT'S TRUE.

15:18.751 --> 15:22.338
AND WHAT'S WORSE IS, I...

15:22.421 --> 15:23.922
I PASSED BACK.

15:26.133 --> 15:28.135
HMM.

15:28.218 --> 15:31.013
WELL, THAT PART I BELIEVE.

15:31.096 --> 15:35.351
BOY, THIS MUST BE
REAL SWEET FOR YOU, HUH?

15:35.434 --> 15:37.978
YOU COULDN'T WAIT
TO TAKE YOUR REVENGE.

15:38.062 --> 15:39.563
WHEN DID YOU PLAN THIS?

15:39.647 --> 15:41.690
WHEN YOU HEARD
SHE WAS COMING

15:41.774 --> 15:43.817
OR WHEN YOU SAW
I WAS HAPPY?

15:43.901 --> 15:44.526
THAT'S NOT TRUE!

15:44.610 --> 15:45.569
IT IS TRUE!

15:45.653 --> 15:47.529
CAROL MADE THE FIRST MOVE.

15:47.613 --> 15:48.864
NOW <i> YOU</i> SHUT UP!

15:48.947 --> 15:50.908
{\an1}SHE LEFT ME
AND WENT AFTER YOU.

15:50.991 --> 15:53.577
{\an1}SHE LEFT YOU
AND WENT AFTER SOME GUY.

15:53.661 --> 15:55.663
{\an1}WHY IS IT SO HARD
TO BELIEVE NOW?

15:55.746 --> 15:57.748
IT'S DIFFERENT THIS TIME!

15:57.831 --> 15:59.750
I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU HURT.

15:59.833 --> 16:01.835
IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO GET HURT

16:01.919 --> 16:03.462
YOU STAY AWAY FROM HER.

16:03.545 --> 16:05.005
BRIAN!

16:08.634 --> 16:12.513
(<i> knocking</i> )

16:12.596 --> 16:13.889
HELLO, CAROL.

16:13.972 --> 16:15.349
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

16:15.432 --> 16:16.517
HELEN, ISN'T IT?

16:16.600 --> 16:17.893
VERY GOOD.

16:17.976 --> 16:20.062
AREN'T YOU GOING
TO INVITE ME IN?

16:20.145 --> 16:21.522
THANK YOU.

16:22.523 --> 16:24.525
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

16:24.608 --> 16:27.027
NO, THE QUESTION IS
WHAT DO <i> YOU</i> WANT?

16:28.612 --> 16:29.947
HAVEN'T YOU SCREWED UP

16:30.030 --> 16:32.074
THE HACKETT BOYS'
LIFE ENOUGH?

16:32.157 --> 16:34.118
HAVE YOU BEEN DRINKING?

16:34.201 --> 16:38.038
I'VE HAD FOUR GLASSES OF CHIANTI
WITH MY SPAGHETTI.

16:38.122 --> 16:41.709
AND I HAD THREE HELPINGS
OF THAT IF YOU MUST KNOW.

16:41.792 --> 16:43.711
WELL, THAT WOULD EXPLAIN

16:43.794 --> 16:46.213
{\an1}THAT ATTRACTIVE
SPAGHETTI SAUCE STAIN

16:46.296 --> 16:48.132
ON YOUR SWEATER THEN.

16:48.215 --> 16:52.094
{\an1}YEAH, I ACCIDENTALLY BOUNCED
A MEATBALL OFF MY LEFT BREAST.

16:52.177 --> 16:54.096
I WANT YOU TO LEAVE.

16:54.179 --> 16:56.306
WELL, THE FEELING IS MUTUAL.

16:58.183 --> 17:01.562
WHERE DO YOU GET OFF
NOT REMEMBERING WHO I AM?

17:01.645 --> 17:04.772
{\an1}WE WERE IN EVERY
SCHOOL PRODUCTION TOGETHER.

17:04.857 --> 17:07.776
{\an1}YOU WERE ALWAYS THE STAR
OF THE SHOW

17:07.859 --> 17:10.779
{\an1}AND I PLAYED THE CELLO
DOWN IN THE PIT.

17:10.863 --> 17:13.656
{\an1}IF THAT ISN'T A METAPHOR
FOR SOMETHING...

17:13.741 --> 17:15.742
YOU EVEN SIGNED MY YEARBOOK.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.580
"I'LL NEVER FORGET YOU.
LOVE, CAROL."

17:22.499 --> 17:24.417
THAT'S <i> YOU?</i>

17:24.501 --> 17:26.795
THE FAT LITTLE CELLIST
DOWN IN THE PIT.

17:26.878 --> 17:28.672
YES, YES! THAT WAS ME!

17:28.756 --> 17:30.466
YOU REMEMBER!

17:30.549 --> 17:32.509
SO, HOW YOU BEEN?

17:34.386 --> 17:36.472
SO, THAT'S WHAT THIS IS
ALL ABOUT?

17:36.555 --> 17:38.307
OH, YES, I REMEMBER YOU.

17:38.390 --> 17:39.975
YOU ALWAYS HATED ME

17:40.058 --> 17:43.771
{\an1}BECAUSE BRIAN AND JOE WERE
INTERESTED IN ME AND NOT YOU.

17:43.854 --> 17:45.314
YOU'RE CRAZY.

17:45.397 --> 17:47.316
THERE WAS PLENTY
OF OTHER REASONS.

17:47.399 --> 17:48.984
BUT THAT WAS THE BIG ONE.

17:49.067 --> 17:51.653
AND APPARENTLY,
THINGS HAVEN'T CHANGED.

17:51.737 --> 17:55.282
OH, IT MUST BE
SO FRUSTRATING FOR YOU.

17:55.365 --> 17:58.827
I HAVE THE BOYS FALLING
ALL OVER EACH OTHER--

17:58.911 --> 18:01.330
{\an3}SOMETHING YOU
COULDN'T ACCOMPLISH.

18:01.413 --> 18:03.999
I'LL BET YOU REMEMBER ME NOW!

18:04.082 --> 18:06.293
(<i> shrieking</i> )

18:12.591 --> 18:15.677
HEY, CAROL! HELEN!

18:15.761 --> 18:17.346
WHAT IS GOING ON?

18:17.429 --> 18:18.639
SHE'S DRUNK!

18:18.722 --> 18:21.225
HAVE YOU BEEN DRINKING,
HELEN?

18:21.308 --> 18:24.520
{\an4}(<i> whispering:</i> )
I HAD A LITTLE WINE
WITH DINNER.

18:24.603 --> 18:26.730
NOW WHAT IS
ALL THIS ABOUT?

18:26.814 --> 18:29.525
{\an1}WELL, LOOK WHO'S ASKING
THE QUESTIONS.

18:29.608 --> 18:32.528
{\an1}I COULD ASK YOU
A REAL DOOZY, LOVERBOY.

18:32.611 --> 18:34.321
AND SO COULD YOUR BROTHER

18:34.404 --> 18:36.323
{\an1}(<i> whispering:</i> )
IF HE KNEW.

18:36.406 --> 18:38.200
I'VE ALREADY TOLD BRIAN.

18:38.283 --> 18:40.327
{\an3}WHAT DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT IT?

18:40.410 --> 18:42.704
{\an1}OH, I SAW YOU TWO PAWING
EACH OTHER.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.540
I BET YOU NEVER GUESSED

18:44.623 --> 18:48.460
THERE WOULD BE SOMEONE SITTING
IN THOSE LOCKERS EATING PIZZA.

18:50.420 --> 18:54.383
{\an1}SHE WAS ALL OVER HIM
LIKE SYRUP ON PANCAKES.

18:54.466 --> 18:56.718
OOH, THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

18:56.802 --> 18:59.346
{\an1}DOES THIS PLACE
HAVE ROOM SERVICE?

18:59.429 --> 19:00.931
I'LL GO CHECK.

19:02.099 --> 19:04.351
HOW COULD YOU <i> DO</i> THIS TO ME?

19:04.434 --> 19:07.020
BRIAN, I AM SO SORRY
IF I HURT YOU.

19:07.104 --> 19:10.274
{\an1}IT'S JUST THAT I FEEL LIKE
I'M BEING TORN APART.

19:10.357 --> 19:12.067
HALF OF ME WANTS YOU

19:12.150 --> 19:14.778
AND ALL THE CRAZINESS
THAT GOES WITH YOU

19:14.862 --> 19:16.071
AND HALF WANTS JOE

19:16.154 --> 19:18.198
SO STRONG AND SOLID.

19:18.282 --> 19:20.075
YOU GET THE HALF THAT COOKS.

19:20.158 --> 19:21.827
HOW CAN YOU JOKE?

19:21.910 --> 19:23.912
BECAUSE IT'S WHAT I DO!

19:23.996 --> 19:26.540
THIS ISN'T FAIR
TO EITHER ONE OF YOU.

19:26.623 --> 19:28.417
I HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.794
WOULD YOU JUST GIVE ME A MINUTE

19:30.878 --> 19:32.921
BECAUSE I CAN'T
THINK STRAIGHT.

19:33.005 --> 19:35.257
WE'LL KNOW SOON ENOUGH.

19:35.340 --> 19:38.427
{\an1}SHE'S DECIDING WHICH ONE OF US
SHE'S GOING TO PICK

19:38.510 --> 19:40.470
LIKE WE'RE A COUPLE OF MELONS.

19:40.554 --> 19:43.056
I'M TAKING MYSELF
OUT OF THE RUNNING.

19:43.140 --> 19:45.767
IF YOU HAVE ANY DIGNITY,
YOU'LL DO THE SAME.

19:45.851 --> 19:47.728
{\an1}DIGNITY'S NOT
MY STRONG SUIT.

19:47.811 --> 19:49.271
LOOK WHAT SHE'S DOING.

19:49.354 --> 19:53.442
LAST TIME SHE CAME BETWEEN US,
WE DIDN'T SPEAK FOR SIX YEARS.

19:53.525 --> 19:55.110
WANT THAT TO HAPPEN AGAIN?

19:55.193 --> 19:57.070
NO.

19:57.154 --> 19:59.698
ONE OF US HAS BEEN
UPFRONT WITH YOU.

19:59.781 --> 20:01.950
ONE OF US HAS TOLD YOU
THE TRUTH.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.578
AND ONLY ONE OF US
REALLY CARES ABOUT YOU.

20:04.661 --> 20:08.290
JUST MY LUCK IT'S YOU.

20:08.373 --> 20:09.917
AH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.294
THIS WOMAN IS POISON TO US.

20:12.377 --> 20:13.921
PURE STRYCHNINE.

20:14.004 --> 20:15.923
LET'S ACT LIKE MEN, BRIAN.

20:16.006 --> 20:17.966
RIGHT YOU ARE, JOSEPH.

20:18.050 --> 20:21.970
{\an1}AS FAR AS SHE'S CONCERNED,
WE'RE NOT INTERESTED.

20:22.054 --> 20:25.682
{\an1}WELL, THERE'S NO GRACIOUS WAY
TO DO THIS, SO...

20:25.766 --> 20:27.517
I PICK BRIAN.

20:27.601 --> 20:29.269
YES! YES! ALL RIGHT! YES!

20:29.353 --> 20:30.979
MELONS, BRIAN, MELONS.

20:31.063 --> 20:32.814
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY!

20:35.275 --> 20:36.818
I'M SORRY, CAROL.

20:36.902 --> 20:38.654
I'M NOT INTERESTED.

20:38.737 --> 20:42.240
I SEE.

20:42.324 --> 20:44.701
AND WHAT
ABOUT YOU, JOE?

20:44.785 --> 20:47.079
ARE YOU
REJECTING ME, TOO?

20:48.497 --> 20:50.415
{\an1}JOE...

20:52.584 --> 20:55.671
{\an1}JOE, SHE'S TALKING
TO YOU.

20:55.754 --> 21:00.425
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?!

21:00.509 --> 21:01.218
LET'S FACE IT.

21:01.301 --> 21:03.345
NEITHER ONE OF US
HAS THE PRUNES

21:03.428 --> 21:05.180
TO BREAK UP WITH HER.

21:05.263 --> 21:07.975
{\an3}IT'S GOING TO HAVE
TO BE A TEAM EFFORT.

21:08.058 --> 21:10.811
{\an1}WE HAVE TO TELL HER
WE CAN'T SEE HER ANYMORE.

21:10.894 --> 21:14.022
LET'S DO IT.

21:14.106 --> 21:15.899
CAROL, WE CAN'T
SEE YOU ANYMORE.

21:15.983 --> 21:18.318

NO GOOD FOR US.

21:18.402 --> 21:19.361
WHAT'S GOING ON?

21:19.444 --> 21:21.029
WE HAD SOME GREAT TIMES

21:21.113 --> 21:23.865
AND THOSE WILL BE
CHERISHED MEMORIES FOR US.

21:23.949 --> 21:26.243
{\an1}YOU REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME
WE SAW HER?

21:26.326 --> 21:28.120
OUR HEART SKIPPED A BEAT.

21:28.203 --> 21:30.038
{\an1}NOW'S THE TIME
TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

21:30.122 --> 21:32.416
WE'RE BREAKING UP
WITH YOU, CAROL.

21:32.499 --> 21:36.211
AND PLEASE, PLEASE,
DON'T TRY TO STOP US.

21:36.294 --> 21:37.504
GOOD-BYE, CAROL.

21:37.587 --> 21:38.714
GOOD-BYE, CAROL.

21:38.797 --> 21:43.176
WELL... YOU BOTH KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE MISSING.
