WEBVTT

02:03.373 --> 02:05.416
THE PACK

02:11.089 --> 02:12.757
I'm not giving any statements.

02:12.841 --> 02:15.093
Over 50,000 have joined
the social media campaign

02:15.176 --> 02:16.678
to find the girl.
What are you doing?

02:16.761 --> 02:18.680
-That's confidential.
-Commissioner.

02:18.763 --> 02:20.515
What do you think about
the negligence accusations

02:20.598 --> 02:21.641
by some senators?

02:21.724 --> 02:25.019
It seems they'd rather
sensationalize our investigation

02:25.103 --> 02:26.813
than find Blanca Ibarra.

02:26.896 --> 02:30.024
I'm going to ask you a favor:
stop spreading that video.

02:30.108 --> 02:31.901
It's bad for the investigation.

02:31.985 --> 02:33.570
Now please, let me do my job.

02:33.653 --> 02:36.531
-Commissioner Fernández, please!
-Commissioner, one last...

02:39.951 --> 02:42.203
-Where's the video from, Javi?
-I don't know.

02:42.287 --> 02:44.747
When it went viral,
they took down the server.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.332
I'm trying
to find the source but...

02:46.416 --> 02:48.835
I need to know
where it came from, now.

02:48.918 --> 02:50.879
-OK.
-Go register at Santa Ines.

02:50.962 --> 02:52.297
Everything, as usual.

02:52.380 --> 02:55.592
Friends, enemies,
men she associated with.

02:55.675 --> 02:58.052
Find out who was absent
the day after the disappearance.

02:58.136 --> 03:00.597
If this is a rape
that ended in kidnapping,

03:00.680 --> 03:02.348
we have to find her
before something worse happens.

03:02.432 --> 03:03.683
OK, excuse me.

03:04.934 --> 03:06.853
Do you think it was
her classmates?

03:07.729 --> 03:10.398
A group of drunk guys
who did this without a plan?

03:14.110 --> 03:16.070
I don't know.
I don't believe anything yet.

03:16.154 --> 03:17.614
Do you?

03:17.697 --> 03:19.908
Why would they send the video
out
to go viral?

03:28.875 --> 03:30.335
Leave me alone.

03:41.471 --> 03:43.932
-It's bad for you to watch this.
-No, Dad.

03:44.015 --> 03:46.017
-Dad, I want to watch it.
-Let it go.

03:46.100 --> 03:48.478
Dad, I'm not going
to stand idly by...

03:50.063 --> 03:51.731
Look, sweetheart...

03:51.814 --> 03:53.232
Honey.

03:56.277 --> 03:58.696
My sister is alone, Dad.

03:58.780 --> 04:01.616
-Blanca is alone.
-I know, sweetie.

04:03.743 --> 04:05.161
Listen to me.

04:06.871 --> 04:09.040
I'm going to find my daughter.

04:09.123 --> 04:11.125
I'm going to find Blanca.

04:13.086 --> 04:16.381
And these motherfuckers...
I'll give them what they
deserve.

04:16.464 --> 04:17.548
You hear me?

04:17.632 --> 04:19.384
-Promise me.
-I promise.

04:19.467 --> 04:21.594
-Promise me you'll kill them.
-I promise.

04:22.929 --> 04:25.765
<i>What's going on?</i>

04:25.848 --> 04:28.726
<i>They kill and rape us</i>
<i>and nobody cares!</i>

04:28.810 --> 04:30.144
We want to be heard!

04:30.228 --> 04:32.772
Enough normalizing
gender violence!

04:32.855 --> 04:34.440
All women unite.

04:34.524 --> 04:36.776
We call on all those
who want to contribute:

04:36.859 --> 04:39.112
tomorrow at 6:00 p.m.
in Plaza Italia.

04:39.195 --> 04:42.532
We have a message for those
who have our friend Blanca.

04:42.615 --> 04:43.866
We're going to hunt you down!

04:43.950 --> 04:46.327
And you'll regret being born!

04:46.411 --> 04:49.205
<i>What's going on?</i>

04:49.288 --> 04:50.665
<i>They kill and rape us!</i>

04:50.748 --> 04:51.791
PROTEST AGAINST
GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE

04:51.874 --> 04:55.003
<i>Over 15 000 people gathered</i>
<i>today in Plaza Italia</i>

04:55.086 --> 04:57.839
<i>to protest violence against</i>
<i>women,</i>

04:57.922 --> 05:01.843
<i>after several cases of abuse</i>
<i>have shaken Chilean society.</i>

05:03.177 --> 05:05.888
<i>The protest against</i>
<i>gender violence was filled</i>

05:05.972 --> 05:09.475
<i>with signs of support</i>
<i>for victims of sexual abuse,</i>

05:09.559 --> 05:11.602
<i>highlighting the emblematic case</i>

05:11.686 --> 05:13.855
<i>of the disappearance</i>
<i>of Blanca Ibarra,</i>

05:13.938 --> 05:17.275
<i>the 17-year-old girl</i>
<i>who went missing days ago</i>

05:17.358 --> 05:21.571
<i>after an alleged gang rape video</i>
<i>went viral on social media.</i>

05:21.654 --> 05:24.532
<i>There's still no news</i>
<i>on her whereabouts.</i>

05:27.243 --> 05:29.495
<i>Despite an astounding number</i>
<i>of supporters,</i>

05:29.579 --> 05:32.165
<i>the event took place peacefully.</i>

05:36.210 --> 05:38.004
You're very strong.

05:38.087 --> 05:40.798
No. Blanca is strong.

05:40.882 --> 05:42.383
Yes, that's true.

05:42.467 --> 05:44.343
I have two very strong girls.

05:47.847 --> 05:49.432
I'll bring you something to eat.

05:49.515 --> 05:51.809
-I'm not hungry, Mom.
-You have to eat.

06:00.151 --> 06:03.362
ALEX, ARE YOU READY
TO GO TO THE NEXT LEVEL?

06:03.446 --> 06:06.908
What do I have to...

06:10.578 --> 06:11.871
What do I have to do?

06:36.479 --> 06:38.106
<i>Proceed.</i>

06:47.156 --> 06:49.408
-Good evening.
-Good evening, Subcommissioner.

06:49.492 --> 06:51.452
-Commissioner Murillo?
-She's over there.

06:51.536 --> 06:53.996
OK. Hi, good evening.

06:58.835 --> 07:00.336
What? Drugs?

07:04.048 --> 07:05.842
It's for tattooing.

07:05.925 --> 07:07.301
Tattoos?

07:07.385 --> 07:09.929
Dried blood...here and there.

07:12.014 --> 07:13.516
What's that?

07:14.809 --> 07:16.185
Be careful.

07:18.896 --> 07:20.606
You're saying
there are two victims?

07:20.690 --> 07:22.066
At least two victims.

07:24.485 --> 07:25.987
Well, at least the forensics
unit

07:26.070 --> 07:28.406
will be thrilled with this
fluid-fest.

07:33.536 --> 07:34.871
Perhaps...

07:45.047 --> 07:46.465
Blanca was here.

07:48.759 --> 07:50.678
They brought her here
after the video.

07:54.098 --> 07:56.475
Shouldn't we wait to see
if the DNA matches?

07:58.603 --> 08:00.813
It will, don't worry.

08:07.987 --> 08:09.989
But this isn't any
old hiding place.

08:12.283 --> 08:13.826
This is a den.

08:15.161 --> 08:16.871
Here they tattooed her.

08:16.954 --> 08:18.372
Here they attacked her.

08:19.415 --> 08:23.586
And then they took her somewhere
or to someone else.

08:25.129 --> 08:27.632
But this isn't just a group
of drunk boys.

08:38.559 --> 08:39.727
What's this?

08:57.912 --> 09:00.289
Good morning. Room service.

09:01.624 --> 09:03.125
Hold on.

09:03.209 --> 09:04.543
Do you remember this mug?

09:06.003 --> 09:08.965
It used to be
the only one you would use.

09:09.048 --> 09:11.342
You had to take it to preschool

09:11.425 --> 09:13.636
because you wouldn't even
drink water from another cup.

09:13.719 --> 09:15.388
Do you remember?

09:15.471 --> 09:16.514
Not much.

09:19.767 --> 09:23.646
Where's that kid who was always
beside me asking me questions?

09:23.729 --> 09:25.231
Alright, don't be annoying.

09:26.565 --> 09:27.858
I'm gonna be late.

09:29.485 --> 09:30.778
Gonzalo...

09:32.446 --> 09:33.531
Are you OK?

09:35.574 --> 09:36.742
Yes.

10:10.943 --> 10:12.611
-Hi.
-Hi.

10:12.695 --> 10:13.779
Thanks.

10:46.479 --> 10:50.483
MEET YOUR PACK

11:11.545 --> 11:13.839
Come on, let's push the front
row!

11:13.923 --> 11:17.176
Push the front row hard!

11:17.259 --> 11:20.221
-Go, Edu!
-What was that, Eduardo?

11:20.304 --> 11:21.597
Hard, man!

11:22.390 --> 11:24.892
Now, get up quickly,
grass is for cows.

11:24.975 --> 11:27.103
What are those muscles for, huh?

11:27.186 --> 11:29.313
Use what Our Lord gave you.

11:30.898 --> 11:32.316
Augusto...

11:41.367 --> 11:43.077
Did you talk to Benjamin?

11:43.160 --> 11:45.788
We talked to his mom, Father,
but she didn't let us in.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.834
We aren't the same team
without him.

11:51.127 --> 11:53.963
I understand the situation
is complicated, but...

11:54.046 --> 11:56.382
We're on the verge of the
qualifying rounds.

11:56.465 --> 11:57.883
He can't be absent.

11:57.967 --> 11:59.718
He doesn't even want to see us.

11:59.802 --> 12:01.554
His mom didn't even
let us talk to him.

12:03.806 --> 12:05.766
OK, don't worry.

12:05.850 --> 12:07.101
I got this.

12:07.184 --> 12:08.561
Hit the showers.

12:13.524 --> 12:15.693
SCHOOL UNDER OCCUPATION

12:15.776 --> 12:16.777
Jose.

12:16.861 --> 12:18.988
Manuel, I don't understand
why we're doing this.

12:19.071 --> 12:21.198
Isn't it good to talk things
over?

12:21.282 --> 12:24.076
Yes, but here we talk
and we talk and go nowhere.

12:24.160 --> 12:26.120
Out there we can do something.

12:26.203 --> 12:27.455
I agree.

12:28.998 --> 12:32.543
I think reporting it is
necessary,
if that's what you mean.

12:32.626 --> 12:35.337
But it's also necessary
to process what's happening.

12:36.380 --> 12:38.591
What we feel can change.

12:38.674 --> 12:41.719
Yeah, but isn't it tedious
to dwell on the same topic?

12:43.888 --> 12:45.347
Why do you say that?

12:45.431 --> 12:47.349
I'm sick of being looked at
with pity.

12:48.851 --> 12:50.853
Journalists only talk shit.

12:50.936 --> 12:52.980
Let's focus
on what's important, please:

12:53.063 --> 12:54.315
finding Blanca.

12:54.398 --> 12:57.067
-I hate being the victim.
-How do you feel?

12:57.818 --> 12:59.153
I feel angry.

13:01.238 --> 13:05.451
Angry at not being able to see
what was going on.

13:05.534 --> 13:08.412
And not being able to react
like a normal woman.

13:08.496 --> 13:10.289
In fact, you reacted like...

13:11.123 --> 13:14.668
thousands of women who are
in your same situation.

13:14.752 --> 13:15.920
You weren't there, Manuel.

13:16.003 --> 13:17.963
Ossandón approached me
and I started shaking.

13:19.089 --> 13:21.383
I didn't want to, but I swear
my whole body was shaking.

13:24.011 --> 13:25.679
Despite all this,

13:25.763 --> 13:30.184
the reports, the protest,
the guy keeps winning.

13:32.561 --> 13:35.856
Girls, I feel that
in one way or another,

13:35.940 --> 13:37.858
we're responsible
for Blanca not being here now.

13:37.942 --> 13:39.235
No, Sofia.

13:41.111 --> 13:43.405
I know that you all feel angry,

13:44.323 --> 13:45.741
One way or another.

13:46.492 --> 13:50.871
This is a space for you
to speak honestly.

13:51.455 --> 13:54.083
To listen to each other,
understand each other.

13:56.126 --> 13:57.836
But believe me,
it's very necessary.

14:04.510 --> 14:05.844
That's all.

14:13.978 --> 14:15.354
Hi, Gracia.

14:17.481 --> 14:18.691
Hi, Jose.

14:19.608 --> 14:20.818
Hi.

14:20.901 --> 14:23.070
Hi, are you the psychologist
here?

14:23.153 --> 14:26.031
Yes, Manuel Montero.
Pleasure, you?

14:26.115 --> 14:28.450
Tere, the mother of Benjamín
Lira.

14:28.534 --> 14:31.412
Oh, a pleasure. How is Benjamín?

14:33.581 --> 14:36.709
He's not very good,
that's why I'm here.

14:38.168 --> 14:40.588
The truth is that I don't know
what to do with him.

14:41.755 --> 14:44.675
OK, come in.

14:44.758 --> 14:47.177
-We better talk inside.
-OK, thank you.

15:05.362 --> 15:06.614
Little guy!

15:17.666 --> 15:19.877
That's a guy thing, buddy.

15:24.506 --> 15:26.091
-Yeah, it was good.
-Yes, it was.

15:27.176 --> 15:30.721
Why don't you put on
your underwear like a man?

15:30.804 --> 15:32.181
Why do you cover yourself up?

15:32.264 --> 15:33.682
Take a joke, man.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.351
You're so serious.

15:36.477 --> 15:39.688
-Wow!
-You get angry fast, Fernández!

15:39.772 --> 15:41.815
Sure, he does everything fast.

15:41.899 --> 15:43.025
He arrives fast...

15:43.108 --> 15:44.860
and comes quickly.

15:44.943 --> 15:47.279
Hey, guys! Guys!
Know what we're gonna call him?

15:47.363 --> 15:49.114
Flash, Flash Fernández.

15:49.198 --> 15:50.866
Sounds like a boxer, right?

15:52.242 --> 15:54.370
Do you want to hit me,
Fernández?

15:54.453 --> 15:56.914
-Don't call me that.
-Come on, hit me!

15:58.457 --> 15:59.667
Hit me.

16:01.460 --> 16:02.586
I have to go.

16:04.004 --> 16:06.382
-As usual.
-OK, stop it!

16:06.465 --> 16:08.050
Stop or what?

16:08.801 --> 16:10.469
Or what?

16:10.552 --> 16:12.388
You like Camila, right?

16:12.471 --> 16:14.056
She's hot, after all.

16:15.349 --> 16:17.434
She has a small butt,
but very sexy.

16:17.518 --> 16:19.353
Pretty hot.

16:19.436 --> 16:20.688
What do you think?

16:20.771 --> 16:22.523
Let's go and see her.
I'll bring you to her.

16:22.606 --> 16:24.900
-Come on!
-Let's go and see her?

16:24.983 --> 16:28.028
No, no, no!

16:28.112 --> 16:32.574
-Flash!
-Flash!

16:32.658 --> 16:34.952
Stop it! No!

16:36.286 --> 16:38.747
No, no!

16:38.831 --> 16:40.958
You'll have a good time.

16:41.041 --> 16:43.127
Come on!

16:44.294 --> 16:46.588
Come on, let him be.

16:46.672 --> 16:48.590
-Are you OK?
-Leave me alone!

16:48.674 --> 16:50.300
Look, look. He's going to come.

16:50.384 --> 16:51.969
Relax, it's not a big deal.

16:54.346 --> 16:56.348
-Bye, Gonzalo!
-You guys are pretty mean, huh?

17:07.943 --> 17:09.862
-Manuel Montero?
-Yes.

17:09.945 --> 17:11.029
Subcommissioner Farías.

17:11.113 --> 17:12.948
I work
with Commissioner Fernández.

17:13.031 --> 17:14.366
She couldn't come so she sent
me.

17:14.450 --> 17:16.493
Nice to meet you.

17:16.577 --> 17:18.495
She told me
you wanted to talk with us.

17:18.579 --> 17:20.247
Yeah.

17:20.330 --> 17:22.249
The mother of a student is
worried

17:22.332 --> 17:24.293
because she thinks her son
knows something

17:24.376 --> 17:25.753
about Blanca's disappearance.

17:25.836 --> 17:27.838
Did she say anything else?

17:27.921 --> 17:29.465
That he doesn't want
to go back to school.

17:29.548 --> 17:31.717
And that he seems anxious,
nervous.

17:32.551 --> 17:35.220
-Do you know him?
-Not much.

17:35.304 --> 17:37.181
Rugby players
aren't very sociable.

17:37.264 --> 17:41.560
But I said I'd talk to him as
long
as the police were present.

17:42.311 --> 17:44.062
I appreciate it.

17:44.146 --> 17:46.064
-Do you know where he lives?
-Very close.

17:46.732 --> 17:50.194
-Is it OK if we take my car?
-It's OK.

17:52.237 --> 17:54.239
Did you find anything?

17:54.323 --> 17:57.034
Nothing suspicious yet
but we have a lot to review.

17:57.117 --> 17:59.161
There's Santa Inés School,

17:59.244 --> 18:00.829
the cellar...

18:00.913 --> 18:02.539
You were looking for me?

18:05.042 --> 18:08.670
Here are the DNA results
that were found in the cabin.

18:08.754 --> 18:11.924
There's a match with the Jane
Doe
you found in the river.

18:13.217 --> 18:14.259
OK.

18:15.427 --> 18:16.929
And Blanca?

18:17.012 --> 18:19.556
Nothing, but the evidence
isn't conclusive.

18:19.640 --> 18:21.767
Do you think
there's someone else involved?

18:22.851 --> 18:25.229
Like someone who didn't
participate in the rape?

18:26.271 --> 18:28.106
I think the rape
and the disappearance

18:28.190 --> 18:29.399
were a form of retaliation.

18:29.483 --> 18:32.861
Blanca was harassed for months
before her disappearance.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.947
Before the protest even began.

18:35.030 --> 18:36.740
Look.

18:36.824 --> 18:38.367
It all started...

18:38.450 --> 18:40.702
around the time
the anti-abuse movement started.

18:41.787 --> 18:43.497
They were playing with her.

18:45.165 --> 18:47.501
They were punishing her
for her activism.

18:48.544 --> 18:50.254
Name just one woman who has
gotten

18:50.337 --> 18:52.756
the word out in the media
that hasn't been destroyed.

18:53.423 --> 18:55.717
"She needs sex. Raping her
would be doing her a favor."

18:55.801 --> 18:57.845
"She should go wash the dishes,
she's on her period."

18:57.928 --> 18:59.346
-But this is different.
-Why?

19:01.682 --> 19:03.267
Pay attention to the attacks.

19:04.643 --> 19:06.645
Pay attention
to the date and time.

19:06.728 --> 19:08.814
It looks like a script.

19:08.897 --> 19:10.566
It's organized.

19:10.649 --> 19:13.235
And if it's organized,
there's a leader, Olivia.

19:14.611 --> 19:16.530
Is that your theory or
Petersen's?

19:17.948 --> 19:20.659
I don't need Petersen to see
the obvious, Olivia.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.413
Have you seen each other again?

19:27.040 --> 19:28.292
No.

19:28.375 --> 19:30.043
I don't want any courtroom
drama.

19:36.758 --> 19:38.010
-Hello?
-<i>Hi.</i>

19:38.093 --> 19:40.137
-Olivia Fernández?
-<i>Who is this?</i>

19:40.220 --> 19:42.598
-It's Celeste Ibarra.
<i>-Celeste.</i>

19:44.099 --> 19:45.684
We need to meet.

19:45.767 --> 19:47.311
Yes, of course.

19:48.896 --> 19:51.106
It can't be at the station.

19:51.189 --> 19:52.774
I'll send you my location.

19:52.858 --> 19:55.193
<i>No problem,</i>
<i>I'll be there right away.</i>

20:16.214 --> 20:18.425
<i>He doesn't want to eat. I have</i>
<i>to force him to drink water.</i>

20:18.508 --> 20:20.719
He's fragile, weak.
I'm worried about him.

20:20.802 --> 20:23.513
-Has he told you anything?
-He doesn't talk.

20:23.597 --> 20:25.057
He just says that...

20:25.140 --> 20:26.975
He wants to be left alone,
he wants to be alone

20:27.059 --> 20:28.310
in his room.

20:28.393 --> 20:30.145
So he doesn't want
to see his friends.

20:31.146 --> 20:32.731
He doesn't want to.

20:32.814 --> 20:34.900
I have a feeling that...

20:34.983 --> 20:37.235
he's afraid of something.

20:37.319 --> 20:39.154
What was his relationship
with Blanca?

20:39.863 --> 20:41.782
They were like...

20:42.532 --> 20:43.992
dating...

20:44.701 --> 20:45.702
or something like that.

20:45.786 --> 20:47.829
He invited her over
a couple of times.

20:49.039 --> 20:50.832
Blanca is a very sweet girl.

20:51.917 --> 20:53.460
An intelligent girl.

20:55.128 --> 20:56.588
I think that...

20:57.798 --> 20:59.883
Benjamín is much more...

21:01.259 --> 21:03.387
interested in her than we
thought.

21:05.847 --> 21:07.224
Sweetheart.

21:07.307 --> 21:08.350
They want to talk with you.

21:08.433 --> 21:10.185
-Who and about what?
-Easy.

21:10.269 --> 21:11.728
-Just a chat.
-Hi, Benjamín.

21:13.146 --> 21:15.148
-What is she doing here?
-Don't worry, sweetheart.

21:15.232 --> 21:17.985
-I asked her to come.
-It's OK sweetheart, come.

21:18.068 --> 21:20.779
-Hi.
-Come, sit here.

21:21.363 --> 21:23.490
-Nothing's going to happen, OK?
-OK.

21:23.573 --> 21:26.702
Your parents are worried
about you.

21:26.785 --> 21:28.495
How are you?

21:30.414 --> 21:31.623
Um...

21:33.291 --> 21:34.584
I'm just...

21:35.961 --> 21:38.380
I'm just worried about Blanca.

21:41.049 --> 21:43.510
I don't know where she is.

21:43.593 --> 21:45.345
And...

21:45.429 --> 21:48.724
We were close friends,
Blanca and I.

21:48.807 --> 21:50.809
And...

21:50.892 --> 21:52.894
It's normal to feel...

21:52.978 --> 21:55.230
To feel worried, right?

21:55.313 --> 21:57.858
Of course it's normal, but...

21:58.859 --> 22:00.610
what isn't normal
is that your best friends

22:00.694 --> 22:02.320
aren't worried at all.

22:05.365 --> 22:08.785
Well, they weren't as close
with Blanca as I was.

22:13.957 --> 22:17.711
I...can't blame them
for being insensitive.

22:18.587 --> 22:23.050
I always played rugby at school
and I motivated Benja with that.

22:23.133 --> 22:25.385
The bond with the team
it's very strong.

22:25.469 --> 22:27.721
But it seems that these boys...

22:29.222 --> 22:30.724
I don't know...

22:30.807 --> 22:33.060
-They're different.
-In what sense?

22:33.143 --> 22:36.104
Sorry, but I don't want to keep
talking about this, OK?

22:36.188 --> 22:37.773
If you want to talk to my
friends,

22:37.856 --> 22:39.191
go interrogate them, not me.

22:39.274 --> 22:41.068
I already told you how I feel,
OK?

22:41.151 --> 22:43.236
-Benja, you...
-You're right, Benjamín.

22:43.320 --> 22:45.781
I think we're not respecting
your pain and your moment.

22:47.240 --> 22:48.784
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

22:48.867 --> 22:50.118
Hey, Benjamín.

22:51.495 --> 22:53.038
-Sorry, he's not well.
-Benjamín.

22:54.164 --> 22:56.333
It's normal.
It's part of the process.

22:56.416 --> 22:58.043
It's OK
if he doesn't want to talk.

22:58.126 --> 22:59.377
His time will come,

22:59.461 --> 23:01.338
and if he doesn't want to go
to school, don't force him.

23:02.380 --> 23:03.715
Thank you very much.

23:03.799 --> 23:05.967
Thanks to you for coming.

23:06.051 --> 23:07.552
Sorry.

23:07.636 --> 23:11.223
May I have the names
of the friends who visited him?

23:12.265 --> 23:15.769
-Please.
-Yes...

23:15.852 --> 23:18.271
Eduardo Valenzuela and...

23:18.355 --> 23:21.191
-Augusto Iturra.
-Perfect.

23:21.274 --> 23:22.484
They're his friends.

23:23.276 --> 23:24.736
Thank you very much.

23:24.820 --> 23:26.154
Let's keep in touch, OK?

23:26.238 --> 23:27.614
Excuse me.

23:36.373 --> 23:38.166
By the way...

23:38.250 --> 23:41.169
One of Benjamin's friends,
Víctor Zúñiga.

23:42.003 --> 23:44.172
His parents sent him
to the United States...

23:44.256 --> 23:45.924
suddenly.

23:46.007 --> 23:48.301
One day he went to school
and the next...

23:48.385 --> 23:50.554
he was on a plane.

23:50.637 --> 23:52.430
-Víctor Zúñiga?
-Yes.

23:52.514 --> 23:54.516
Thank you very much
for the information.

23:54.599 --> 23:55.642
We'll be in touch.

23:55.725 --> 23:57.102
-Thank you.
-Take care.

24:48.236 --> 24:49.446
Thank you for coming.

24:50.197 --> 24:51.573
I didn't know who else to call.

24:52.866 --> 24:55.660
-Your parents know you're here?
-No.

24:56.786 --> 24:58.079
Minors need a parents'
permission

24:58.163 --> 25:00.540
to make a statement, Celeste.

25:01.750 --> 25:03.752
They have no idea
what's happening.

25:04.419 --> 25:07.339
My sister's involved
in weird stuff, a game.

25:07.422 --> 25:08.715
What game?

25:08.798 --> 25:10.550
It's called the Wolf Game.

25:11.509 --> 25:13.053
It's a game for men.

25:13.136 --> 25:14.804
To get revenge on women.

25:14.888 --> 25:16.681
My sister was chosen as prey.

25:16.765 --> 25:18.516
Part of the test
is to choose a victim...

25:18.600 --> 25:20.602
How does the game work?

25:20.685 --> 25:22.938
First they ask you
to do weird things.

25:23.021 --> 25:25.232
Like staying up all night,

25:25.315 --> 25:27.651
marking women, spying on them.

25:28.693 --> 25:30.028
What kind of marks?

25:30.111 --> 25:31.238
Like this.

25:35.742 --> 25:37.285
Who did that to you?

25:38.328 --> 25:39.788
I did.

25:39.871 --> 25:41.706
I entered the game
with a fake name.

25:42.791 --> 25:44.334
They know you're a woman?

25:44.417 --> 25:45.877
No.

25:45.961 --> 25:47.295
They gave me this phone

25:47.379 --> 25:50.465
and now they want me to meet
my pack to go hunting.

25:50.548 --> 25:52.634
I saw them meet, Olivia!
They're normal people...

25:52.717 --> 25:54.719
We're not using you
as bait, Celeste.

25:54.803 --> 25:56.054
But I contacted them.

25:56.137 --> 25:58.598
OK, but now you have
to leave it to us.

25:58.682 --> 26:01.559
-What about my sister?
-I'll find your sister.

26:03.436 --> 26:04.729
You have to trust me.

26:04.813 --> 26:06.731
Now I'm taking you home.

26:07.691 --> 26:10.527
And promise me
you won't do anything else.

26:10.610 --> 26:11.861
OK?

26:12.946 --> 26:14.406
OK, let's go.

26:26.376 --> 26:28.837
<i>Javi, I'm bringing</i>
<i>an Android phone to Cybercrime.</i>

26:28.920 --> 26:30.714
<i>I need to know</i>
<i>everything that's on it.</i>

26:30.797 --> 26:33.758
-OK, give me one hour.
-<i>Half an hour, Javi.</i>

26:33.842 --> 26:34.968
OK.

27:29.689 --> 27:31.775
ALEX, ARE YOU READY
TO GO TO THE NEXT LEVEL?

27:33.526 --> 27:34.986
YES

27:35.070 --> 27:36.696
CHOOSE A VICTIM, ALEX,
A WOMAN YOU WANT.

27:36.780 --> 27:38.156
MARK HER AS IF SHE WERE YOURS.

27:39.741 --> 27:41.618
THE PACK STAYS TOGETHER.
WE ARE BROTHERS.

27:51.002 --> 27:53.380
Shut the system down now!
Disconnect everything!

27:55.090 --> 27:56.174
No, no!

28:28.373 --> 28:29.833
Come on, eat.

28:32.252 --> 28:33.253
That's it.

28:38.550 --> 28:39.926
What are you doing here?

28:41.261 --> 28:42.512
You were right.

28:43.179 --> 28:44.556
What are you talking about?

28:45.640 --> 28:49.894
Your Jane Doe is not Blanca,
but the cases may be connected.

28:49.978 --> 28:51.229
The Pack.

28:51.312 --> 28:55.191
That's the name of the group
that uploaded the first video.

28:55.275 --> 28:58.111
Cybercrime tried
to track the IP address.

28:58.194 --> 29:00.989
-Apparently it's abroad.
-Deep web?

29:01.948 --> 29:04.784
Worst of all,
they tried to hack the page.

29:04.868 --> 29:06.703
They sent us a virus.

29:06.786 --> 29:09.205
The rape was the first action.

29:09.998 --> 29:12.542
-OK.
-The video was the second.

29:12.625 --> 29:13.751
Exactly.

29:13.835 --> 29:15.962
We have two acts
of misogynist violence.

29:16.045 --> 29:17.172
Two crimes.

29:18.214 --> 29:19.799
They could be connected.

29:19.883 --> 29:21.885
They might even be
the same perpetrator.

29:23.094 --> 29:24.387
Why not?

29:29.809 --> 29:31.144
Why are you
going through my stuff?

29:31.227 --> 29:32.979
Why do you have
a second phone, Augusto?

29:33.062 --> 29:35.064
-None of your business.
-Don't even think about it.

29:38.943 --> 29:40.403
OK, done.

29:40.487 --> 29:41.905
Reformatted and deleted.

29:44.282 --> 29:46.367
What did I tell you about going
through my stuff, Mom?

29:47.494 --> 29:49.412
Luckily I didn't listen to you.

29:49.496 --> 29:52.957
I figured you'd be stupid enough
to air your dirty laundry.

29:53.041 --> 29:54.334
What are you talking about?

29:54.417 --> 29:56.669
Your friend Víctor
up and left the country.

29:56.753 --> 29:59.339
-Isn't that suspicious?
-Víctor had a study trip, Mom.

30:00.131 --> 30:02.759
I read the last messages
that you two sent each other.

30:03.510 --> 30:06.221
Making fun of Blanca,
exchanging memes.

30:07.055 --> 30:08.806
Are you two stupid or what?

30:09.557 --> 30:11.351
-It's dark humor.
-Oh!

30:12.435 --> 30:14.229
It won't seem funny to the
police.

30:14.854 --> 30:17.190
Or to Blanca's family's lawyers,

30:17.273 --> 30:18.316
not at all.

30:24.489 --> 30:26.157
Mom, I didn't do anything.

30:26.241 --> 30:27.450
Augusto...

30:28.243 --> 30:31.162
It doesn't matter what you did
or didn't do.

30:31.246 --> 30:32.747
You and your friends,

30:32.830 --> 30:34.332
those who opposed the protest,

30:34.415 --> 30:35.917
will be the first suspects.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.377
We didn't do anything.

30:38.336 --> 30:40.296
Welcome to the world of adults.

30:41.589 --> 30:43.299
Can you help me with this,
please?

30:46.469 --> 30:47.845
From now on...

30:48.555 --> 30:51.224
I decide how this situation
is handled.

30:51.307 --> 30:52.517
Is that clear?

31:01.276 --> 31:03.111
Anything else I should know?

31:05.363 --> 31:06.698
No, nothing.

31:08.533 --> 31:09.659
Bye.

31:25.592 --> 31:28.636
Boss, I followed Bruno Ibarra.
Look who he visited.

32:10.136 --> 32:14.265
https://TheWolfGame666.onion

32:26.110 --> 32:32.075
Hello, how can I join
the wolf game?

32:39.248 --> 32:40.458
<i>Who's there?</i>

32:40.541 --> 32:41.793
Petersen, it's...

32:52.428 --> 32:54.597
Ten years
and you haven't changed a bit.

32:54.681 --> 32:56.849
I wish I could say
the same about you.

33:00.186 --> 33:01.396
Do you still like this?

33:21.332 --> 33:22.750
Did you receive my book?

33:27.046 --> 33:28.840
There are several
of your ideas in it,

33:28.923 --> 33:31.551
but I thought it could harm you
if I made them public.

33:32.427 --> 33:33.636
Oh, yeah?

33:35.221 --> 33:36.514
Well, well...

33:37.515 --> 33:39.684
Do you really believe
everything you wrote?

33:39.767 --> 33:40.977
Of course.

33:50.278 --> 33:52.071
Then murderers are made.

33:52.947 --> 33:54.532
They're not born murderers?

33:56.325 --> 34:00.037
The world is run by
narcissistic psychopaths, Elisa.

34:00.913 --> 34:02.915
They're educated,
grow up, get married,

34:02.999 --> 34:04.792
like any ordinary person.

34:05.418 --> 34:08.504
They're priests, doctors,
big businessmen...

34:08.588 --> 34:09.714
judges.

34:10.631 --> 34:13.050
-Policemen.
-Policemen, too. Yes.

34:14.135 --> 34:16.053
They're everywhere.

34:16.137 --> 34:18.181
They get off on humiliating
their colleagues,

34:18.264 --> 34:21.017
firing their employees en masse,

34:21.100 --> 34:24.979
dumping their companies' waste
in rivers, the ocean, lakes.

34:25.730 --> 34:28.274
And they've always
gotten away with it.

34:28.357 --> 34:30.735
People even love, admire,
and respect them

34:30.818 --> 34:33.321
because they create jobs,
because...

34:33.404 --> 34:36.949
they have incredible ways
to justify their atrocities.

34:37.033 --> 34:40.578
But what I'm interested
in knowing is...

34:43.080 --> 34:48.503
what leads a human being
to commit these horrors?

34:51.047 --> 34:52.715
It isn't an impulse.

34:54.258 --> 34:55.927
It's a nature.

34:57.637 --> 34:59.597
How to create a monster?

35:01.724 --> 35:03.017
That's the question.

35:06.229 --> 35:08.731
I wanted to show you
this material, look.

35:09.816 --> 35:12.777
These photos are interesting,
but there's something...

35:14.320 --> 35:15.404
Here.

35:16.614 --> 35:19.867
Look, they act as independent,
disconnected cells.

35:19.951 --> 35:22.787
But they're actually
entirely connected.

35:22.870 --> 35:23.913
What do you think?

35:23.996 --> 35:25.790
Who would do that?

35:27.500 --> 35:30.878
A brilliant, perverse person.

35:31.838 --> 35:33.840
A narcissistic psychopath.

35:34.882 --> 35:37.844
You might think
it's kids behind this, right?

35:37.927 --> 35:40.054
But no, they're adults,

35:40.137 --> 35:44.517
adults who behave like children,
deeply bored by life.

35:45.560 --> 35:49.897
And they need these games
to dominate, humiliate others.

35:51.482 --> 35:55.152
<i>It used to take years</i>
<i>to influence someone,</i>

35:55.236 --> 35:57.446
<i>to understand</i>
<i>their mental structure.</i>

35:57.530 --> 36:00.700
<i>Capture them</i>
<i>and turn them into a monster.</i>

36:01.659 --> 36:06.038
<i>Now in a month, in weeks,</i>
<i>you can have them in your hands,</i>

36:06.122 --> 36:08.875
<i>and make them do</i>
<i>whatever you want.</i>

36:16.090 --> 36:18.050
WOMEN WILL
GO BACK TO THE PLACE

36:18.134 --> 36:20.219
THEY NEVER SHOULD HAVE LEFT

36:22.096 --> 36:23.764
GONZALO, DO YOU WANT
TO PLAY A GAME?

36:23.848 --> 36:24.891
YES - NO

36:24.974 --> 36:27.059
YES

36:35.401 --> 36:38.195
<i>It's a misogynist game</i>
<i>designed to attack women.</i>

36:38.279 --> 36:40.323
It consists of following them,

36:40.406 --> 36:43.492
filming them without permission,
and attacking them.

36:43.576 --> 36:46.370
We don't know anyone
who's entered the final stage,

36:46.454 --> 36:49.665
but we know it consists of rape,
kidnapping and worse.

36:49.749 --> 36:52.919
There are some encrypted files
that we couldn't open.

36:53.002 --> 36:55.630
This is professional-level
encryption.

36:55.713 --> 36:57.256
Cyber criminals, hackers.

36:59.216 --> 37:00.384
Will you be able to open it?

37:00.468 --> 37:03.179
Maybe we could
hack the system but...

37:03.262 --> 37:04.847
It will take time.

37:04.931 --> 37:07.266
-How long?
-Days...

37:07.350 --> 37:09.644
-Maybe weeks.
-Time we don't have, I know.

37:09.727 --> 37:11.771
And what about Ossandón?

37:11.854 --> 37:13.981
You said it all started
with the accusations...

37:14.065 --> 37:17.401
No, it's a teen game,
not a teacher's.

37:17.485 --> 37:20.780
The M.O. is that a boy
chooses a girl.

37:20.863 --> 37:22.740
He seduces her or earns her
trust,

37:22.823 --> 37:24.408
and then he marks her, like
prey.

37:24.492 --> 37:26.953
And that coincides
with what Benjamín told us.

37:27.036 --> 37:28.746
Well, what he told us
and what he didn't...

37:28.829 --> 37:30.122
Speaking of Benjamín...

37:30.206 --> 37:31.540
If he's part of The Pack,

37:31.624 --> 37:33.584
it's because
people he trusts are in, too.

37:33.668 --> 37:36.504
We know Benjamín and Blanca
were in a relationship.

37:36.587 --> 37:38.881
We don't know if they were
official, so to speak.

37:38.965 --> 37:40.549
And Benjamín's mom told me

37:40.633 --> 37:43.344
that two rugby guys paid them
a suspicious visit.

37:43.427 --> 37:44.929
And there's a fourth rugby
player.

37:45.012 --> 37:47.473
Víctor Zúñiga,
who curiously left the country

37:47.556 --> 37:49.934
the night Blanca disappeared.

37:50.851 --> 37:54.021
So, Augusto, Benjamín,
Eduardo and Víctor would be...

37:54.105 --> 37:55.231
The Pack.

38:15.626 --> 38:17.086
-Freeze!
-Take the back!

38:21.382 --> 38:22.550
Stop, bastard!

38:29.223 --> 38:30.558
-Over here!
-OK, I'm sorry.

38:30.641 --> 38:32.101
Don't move!

38:32.184 --> 38:34.311
-I'm sorry...
-Stay still.

39:30.326 --> 39:31.660
Hey, fucking snitch!

39:32.995 --> 39:35.206
Call the ladies
to come defend you.

39:35.289 --> 39:36.415
Please--

39:38.334 --> 39:39.543
No! No!

39:41.295 --> 39:42.588
#MeToo, huh?

39:44.882 --> 39:46.217
Get the message?

39:47.134 --> 39:48.594
Keep your fucking mouth shut.

39:50.846 --> 39:52.556
Alright, that's it!

39:55.142 --> 39:56.644
Let's go! Let's go!

40:09.406 --> 40:10.699
Pardon the delay.

40:12.201 --> 40:14.286
Hi Benjamín, I'm Olivia
Fernández.

40:14.370 --> 40:16.413
Investigative Police
Commissioner.

40:17.623 --> 40:18.874
Are you tired?

40:19.834 --> 40:20.876
Yes...

40:20.960 --> 40:22.378
I haven't slept at all.

40:22.461 --> 40:24.839
Commissioner, begin
your questioning now, please.

40:24.922 --> 40:27.842
You know my client is a minor,
so this has to be fast.

40:27.925 --> 40:29.760
It's simple, Benjamín.

40:30.594 --> 40:32.721
I want to know
what happened that night.

40:33.889 --> 40:35.975
Well, we won a...

40:37.351 --> 40:40.938
a rugby match...with the team.

40:41.021 --> 40:43.816
So we were going to celebrate,

40:43.899 --> 40:45.818
at one of our teammates' houses.

40:46.902 --> 40:49.864
And...I was going to arrive
later because...

40:51.031 --> 40:53.492
I had to go get the car.

40:53.576 --> 40:54.910
My father's car.

40:55.911 --> 40:57.079
And...

40:59.790 --> 41:01.834
Because I was going to pick
up...

41:01.917 --> 41:02.960
Who?

41:07.339 --> 41:09.300
Benjamín, who did you have
to pick up?

41:09.383 --> 41:10.593
Tell me the name.

41:12.469 --> 41:13.554
Blanca.

41:13.637 --> 41:15.764
You went to pick up Blanca
Ibarra.

41:23.439 --> 41:24.815
We're just about there.

41:27.568 --> 41:29.236
Where?

41:29.320 --> 41:31.363
<i>Then I took her to a lookout.</i>

41:32.489 --> 41:34.241
Would you say you were dating
her?

41:34.325 --> 41:35.701
<i>Something like that.</i>

41:38.871 --> 41:41.999
And then Augusto, Víctor,
and Eduardo arrived

41:42.082 --> 41:43.584
and we started drinking...

41:43.667 --> 41:48.088
partying and...I drank a lot.

41:48.172 --> 41:49.715
<i>I shouldn't have drunk so much,</i>

41:49.798 --> 41:52.509
<i>because I don't remember</i>
<i>so much...</i>

41:52.593 --> 41:53.761
Oh, shit!

41:56.138 --> 41:58.724
I only know that we took her
to a warehouse and...

42:02.519 --> 42:04.230
We all had sex with her.

42:10.736 --> 42:12.321
-Oh, good!
-Yeah, man!

42:12.404 --> 42:13.989
And then we put her in my car

42:14.073 --> 42:17.576
and we took her a few blocks
away from the school.

42:17.660 --> 42:19.286
You're telling me

42:19.370 --> 42:21.622
you allowed all your friends
to have sex

42:21.705 --> 42:23.707
with the girl you were dating.

42:25.626 --> 42:27.795
Calm down.
Breathe through your nose.

42:27.878 --> 42:31.632
-What are you doing, Benjamín?
-Come on!

42:32.800 --> 42:35.094
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

42:35.177 --> 42:36.303
<i>Benjamín, look at me.</i>

42:36.387 --> 42:38.013
Benjamín!

42:38.889 --> 42:41.433
Look, I have a son,
almost your age.

42:42.476 --> 42:44.478
And I know perfectly well
that teenagers

42:44.561 --> 42:46.355
sometimes commit
frightening mistakes,

42:46.438 --> 42:48.440
because the pressure is hard.

42:48.524 --> 42:49.817
For fear of bullying,

42:49.900 --> 42:51.360
for fear of being left alone

42:51.443 --> 42:53.445
or that they'll laugh at you.

42:53.529 --> 42:55.239
It's very real.

42:56.073 --> 42:57.491
But life is long, Benjamín.

42:58.033 --> 43:01.287
And an instant of fragility
and fear can fuck it up.

43:01.370 --> 43:03.789
Benjamín. If Blanca Ibarra dies,

43:03.872 --> 43:06.000
you carry that with you for
life.

43:06.083 --> 43:08.043
Commissioner, you're feeding
my client answers

43:08.127 --> 43:09.295
that he hasn't given.

43:09.378 --> 43:10.587
Alright, alright.

43:11.797 --> 43:13.716
One last question.

43:16.677 --> 43:19.805
If you left Blanca a few blocks
away from school,

43:19.888 --> 43:23.684
and she didn't go to school,
nor did she go home,

43:25.561 --> 43:26.895
<i>who took her?</i>

43:31.025 --> 43:33.068
Benjamín! Where is Blanca?
