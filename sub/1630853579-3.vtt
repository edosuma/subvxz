WEBVTT

01:14.448 --> 01:15.827
Ooh! Come with me!

01:17.379 --> 01:20.103
<i>On the west</i> <i>
coast of New Zealand's</i> <i>
south island...</i>

01:20.137 --> 01:21.620
Oh, yeah!

01:21.655 --> 01:24.517
<i>...Parker</i> <i>
and his team are</i> <i>
a week into his search...</i>

01:24.551 --> 01:25.620
Whoa!

01:25.655 --> 01:26.862
<i>...for a cutting</i> <i>
edge wash plant...</i>

01:26.896 --> 01:29.034
Oh, my [bleep]!

01:29.068 --> 01:30.310
<i>...and new</i> <i>
mining techniques...</i>

01:30.344 --> 01:31.758
This is epic!

01:31.793 --> 01:34.965
<i>...to take back</i> <i>
to his claim in Alaska.</i>

01:35.000 --> 01:37.620
<i>New Zealand's</i> <i>
home to the most efficient</i>

01:37.655 --> 01:39.793
<i>and innovative gold miners,</i>

01:39.827 --> 01:41.862
as far as I'm concerned,
in the world,

01:41.896 --> 01:43.931
so, that's why we're here.

01:43.965 --> 01:46.620
<i>To better
understand New Zealand's gold,</i>

01:46.655 --> 01:49.724
<i>the team head 3,000</i> <i>
feet above sea level</i>

01:49.758 --> 01:52.068
<i>to the Tai Poutini</i> <i>
National Park</i>

01:52.103 --> 01:55.137
<i>to explore the mighty</i> <i>
Franz Josef Glacier.</i>

01:55.172 --> 01:57.931
So, as you can see,

01:57.965 --> 01:59.793
the glacier's been here
for millions of years,

01:59.827 --> 02:01.517
<i>but the ice get</i> <i>
replenished really fast.</i>

02:02.827 --> 02:04.517
- Did you hear it move just then?
- Yes.

02:04.551 --> 02:06.482
So, that's
the glacier just shuddering
underneath us,

02:06.517 --> 02:09.586
as it moves, it'll make these
thumps and cracks, yeah.

02:09.620 --> 02:12.931
Hey, Rookie,
what if this thing just
decided to just, like...

02:14.206 --> 02:15.517
Close its doors.

02:15.551 --> 02:17.965
Like the garbage
compactor in Star Wars.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.896
Well, it wouldn't,
which is good for you guys,

02:20.931 --> 02:23.655
and if it did, you would
behave much like a toothpaste.

02:23.689 --> 02:25.517
Like a pimple.

02:25.551 --> 02:28.000
They do close up, but they
won't close up rapidly.

02:28.034 --> 02:29.241
Oh, my [bleep]!

02:29.275 --> 02:31.517
- We'll keep moving, shall we?
- Okay.

02:31.551 --> 02:32.724
- Oh...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:34.034 --> 02:35.241
Are you all right?

02:35.275 --> 02:36.896
Yeah, I'm fine.

02:36.931 --> 02:38.586
Tyler has
the grace of a new born deer.

02:38.620 --> 02:41.172
Oh, my [bleep],
I'm very out of my comfort
zone, I'm from the desert.

02:43.068 --> 02:44.379
Oh, my

02:44.413 --> 02:45.517
Don't know how you
did that with a camera.

02:49.517 --> 02:51.103
Hey,
just as a warning,

02:51.137 --> 02:52.793
so, we're watching this
cloud build up behind us,

02:52.827 --> 02:54.482
you would have known
we flew in with no cloud.

02:54.517 --> 02:56.310
And now we've got cloud.

02:56.344 --> 02:58.448
But we think that
this gonna blow through.

02:58.482 --> 02:59.655
So, we just gonna be
keeping an eye on that.

02:59.689 --> 03:00.620
Got ya.

03:04.724 --> 03:06.310
Lots of quartz.

03:06.344 --> 03:08.000
We're close
to the source.

03:08.034 --> 03:09.655
I wonder if anybody
ever finds a nugget.

03:10.620 --> 03:11.724
Yeah, look at that.

03:11.758 --> 03:12.551
Yeah!

03:13.551 --> 03:14.827
What do you think of that, Ty?

03:14.862 --> 03:16.965
<i>Well, when we</i> <i>
talk about, um,</i>

03:17.000 --> 03:19.344
<i>big glacial movements</i> <i>
moving the gold,</i>

03:19.379 --> 03:20.655
<i>this is what we're</i> <i>
talking about.</i>

03:22.896 --> 03:26.172
<i>To date,</i> <i>
over 300 tons of gold</i>

03:26.206 --> 03:30.241
<i>worth more than $15 billion</i> <i>
of today's prices</i>

03:30.275 --> 03:33.068
<i>has been mined</i> <i>
on New Zealand's west coast.</i>

03:34.758 --> 03:37.689
<i>The majority was freed</i> <i>
from these mountains,</i>

03:37.724 --> 03:39.413
<i>and carried down by glaciers.</i>

03:41.310 --> 03:43.551
How does it work then?
Where, what, what do you mean,

03:43.586 --> 03:45.172
"it carries it down,"
it just breaks the ground up?

03:45.206 --> 03:48.551
Yeah, like, the erosion
caused by glaciers is huge.

03:48.586 --> 03:49.655
Right? Just, like...

03:51.206 --> 03:54.068
...thousands of tons
of ice grinding
against the mountains.

03:54.103 --> 03:55.965
Where's the gold
sitting, like?

03:56.000 --> 03:57.551
Well, the gold's, like,
in quartz veins.

03:57.586 --> 04:00.758
The glaciers work
the material,

04:00.793 --> 04:03.896
and, like, you know,
move it from one
valley to the next.

04:05.724 --> 04:07.551
<i>900-feet thick,</i>

04:07.586 --> 04:12.655
<i>the Franz Josef Glacier</i> <i>
descends the Southern Alps</i> <i>
for almost eight miles,</i>

04:12.689 --> 04:15.310
<i>plucking gold from quartz</i> <i>
veins as it moves.</i>

04:16.827 --> 04:18.896
<i>The colossal weight</i> <i>
of the glacier</i>

04:18.931 --> 04:23.172
<i>grinds it into a fine</i> <i>
powder known as flour gold.</i>

04:23.206 --> 04:26.758
<i>As the glacier melts,</i> <i>
this gold is released</i> <i>
into positive</i>

04:26.793 --> 04:29.517
<i>across the rivers
and valleys of the west coast.</i>

04:30.758 --> 04:32.827
That's how by the time
it gets to the ocean,

04:32.862 --> 04:34.827
- how we were speaking about how fine it is...
- Mmm.

04:34.862 --> 04:37.586
...in the west coast,
it's because it's
traveled so far

04:37.620 --> 04:39.896
with such huge water movement,
it's just broken it down,

04:39.931 --> 04:41.931
and it's made it finer
and finer and finer and finer.

04:53.137 --> 04:56.137
Hey, Rookie, there's
a definite change going
on down the valley, bro.

04:56.172 --> 04:57.551
Yeah, I'm keen
to get out of here.

04:57.586 --> 04:59.172
What's happening,
Rookie, tell me.

04:59.206 --> 05:00.758
We can see that there's
a change in the weather.

05:00.793 --> 05:02.965
Oh, the clouds
are coming in.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.448
Are we allowed
to fly through that?

05:04.482 --> 05:05.931
We fly
underneath it, yeah,

05:05.965 --> 05:07.275
so, it's not quite low enough
to shut us down yet.

05:07.310 --> 05:08.724
Yeah, this is ugly.

05:08.758 --> 05:10.827
<i>And if it did</i> <i>
shut us down, you mean...</i>

05:10.862 --> 05:12.896
We might just,
uh, stay the night up here.

05:12.931 --> 05:13.896
No.

05:15.517 --> 05:17.758
That actually makes
me a little nervous!

05:17.793 --> 05:19.034
So, we're gonna go.

05:19.068 --> 05:21.551
Oh, my [bleep], when
the guard's saying,
"we gotta go..."

05:22.655 --> 05:23.655
Gotta go!

05:25.103 --> 05:26.724
Are we going straight
in the chopper now?

05:26.758 --> 05:27.620
Yeah.

05:27.655 --> 05:28.965
Ty,
we better go, come on.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.172
Yeah, I'm trying, Dan.

05:30.206 --> 05:31.517
We're gonna go
back through this crevasse.

05:31.551 --> 05:32.827
Ty, speed it up.

05:32.862 --> 05:34.137
- I'm trying!
- Foxtrot Oscar.

05:34.172 --> 05:36.827
What are
the odds that we get
stuck up here right now?

05:36.862 --> 05:38.206
20%.

05:38.241 --> 05:40.827
What? We have
20% of spending the night
in the mountain?

05:40.862 --> 05:41.724
Yeah.

05:41.758 --> 05:42.793
We've gotta go!

05:42.827 --> 05:43.896
Well,
just keep moving, guys.

05:48.517 --> 05:49.620
Ty, hurry up!

05:49.655 --> 05:50.793
I'm going, Dan!

05:52.034 --> 05:52.896
I can't get my...

05:52.931 --> 05:53.724
Whoa, easy!

05:57.344 --> 05:58.965
Tyler, we need to go.

05:59.000 --> 06:00.655
My fat arse
won't fit through.

06:03.793 --> 06:05.000
Oh, my

06:05.034 --> 06:05.965
Thank you.

06:06.000 --> 06:06.896
Not a worries.

06:15.448 --> 06:17.000
All right, come on, guys,
it's time to go.

06:17.862 --> 06:18.896

Ooh, good name.

07:05.586 --> 07:06.862
It is a good name.

07:06.896 --> 07:09.310
He, um, is well known
in the area for doing
wash plants.

07:09.344 --> 07:10.551
Yeah, I've heard
lots about him.

07:10.586 --> 07:12.724
So, I'm hoping
Peter will, um,

07:12.758 --> 07:13.793
have something to sell.

07:13.827 --> 07:15.206
Oh, this'll be great.

07:15.241 --> 07:19.000
<i>Parker has</i> <i>

<i>With just ten weeks</i> <i>

it for time.</i>

07:34.137 --> 07:36.551
If we don't find a plant
in-country to buy,

07:36.586 --> 07:38.896
that we can move to Fairbanks

07:38.931 --> 07:40.551
that's gonna be as
specialized as I want it,

a meeting with gold miner</i>

<i>and wash plant builder,</i> <i>
Peter Haddock</i>

07:48.586 --> 07:51.448
<i>100 miles north in Greymouth,</i>

07:51.482 --> 07:54.275
<i>which was at the heart</i> <i>
of the west coast gold rush.</i>

07:55.413 --> 07:58.586
<i>When gold was</i> <i>
discovered in 1864</i>

07:58.620 --> 08:03.137
<i>on the Taramakau River,</i> <i>
miners flooded the area.</i>

08:03.172 --> 08:06.344
<i>They became masters</i> <i>
at finding innovative ways</i>

08:06.379 --> 08:08.413
<i>to catch the fine</i> <i>
glacial gold.</i>

08:10.137 --> 08:13.034
<i>And almost 160 years later,</i>

08:13.068 --> 08:16.206
<i>locals like Peter</i> <i>

<i>Peter's known</i> <i>
for floating wash plants,</i>

08:20.172 --> 08:21.551

we haven't seen yet.

08:22.379 --> 08:23.517
The dredge?

08:23.551 --> 08:26.620
No, they're, it's a wash
plant that floats, basically.

08:26.655 --> 08:28.172
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:28.206 --> 08:29.448
Wow.

08:29.482 --> 08:32.241
I mean, it's the same concept
of the big bucket line dredges

08:32.275 --> 08:34.275
just instead of a bucket
line there's an excavator.

08:35.551 --> 08:37.068
Something that could
interest you, Parker?

08:38.689 --> 08:39.551
Um...

08:40.586 --> 08:43.379
...I don't really know
much about them,

08:43.413 --> 08:45.724
but I've met a lot of people
that have made a lot of money

08:45.758 --> 08:48.137
with floating wash plants, so,

08:48.172 --> 08:49.482
there's definitely
something to it.

08:58.586 --> 08:59.689
Right, let's get out.

09:00.517 --> 09:01.655
Let's see what he's got.

09:07.827 --> 09:09.896
- How ya doing?
- How's it going?

09:09.931 --> 09:12.068
Pleased to meet ya, Tyler,
after we talked on the phone.

09:12.103 --> 09:14.000
Yeah, yeah, great to see ya.

09:14.034 --> 09:15.724
- How's it going?
- Good, good. Yeah.

09:15.758 --> 09:17.517
Bloody pleased
to meet ya, bud, yeah.

09:17.551 --> 09:18.551
Awesome.

09:18.586 --> 09:19.896
Yeah, well, welcome
to the E-Quip workshop.

09:19.931 --> 09:22.793

um, do all our work.

09:22.827 --> 09:25.413
<i>As well as</i> <i>
running his own gold mine,</i>

09:25.448 --> 09:28.206
<i>Peter Haddock has designed</i> <i>

<i>to gold miners</i> <i>

09:36.344 --> 09:39.758
I've always felt like
gold miners made
good plant makers

09:39.793 --> 09:42.620
because they know
what works and what
doesn't work, you know?

09:42.655 --> 09:43.517
Yeah, exactly.

09:46.758 --> 09:48.586
You guys look like
you're building a plant
right now, huh?

09:48.620 --> 09:51.068
Yeah, we are, it's land-based,
you know, on the skids.

09:51.103 --> 09:52.862
Are you still, uh,
doing the floating plants?

09:52.896 --> 09:54.482
Yeah.

09:54.517 --> 09:56.896
I've actually
never been, I've seen
a lot of photos

09:56.931 --> 09:59.000
and videos, but I've
never been around one.

09:59.034 --> 10:00.413
- Oh, really?
- A floater. No.

10:00.448 --> 10:02.241

Part of me
job this afternoon,

10:12.896 --> 10:15.827
um, was to fold up
the catch tray, and we were
gonna do some rolling.

10:16.448 --> 10:18.620
Um, I can do that.

10:18.655 --> 10:19.758

10:21.103 --> 10:22.517
Yeah, good, good.

10:22.551 --> 10:24.724
- This is right up Jeff's alley, so...
- Yeah.

10:24.758 --> 10:26.931

10:26.965 --> 10:28.551
Yeah, would that
be all right, Jeff?

10:28.586 --> 10:30.103
- Sounds good!
- Good.

10:30.137 --> 10:31.793
Well, I'll hook you
up now to Mike,

10:31.827 --> 10:33.413
our sort of foreman here,

10:33.448 --> 10:35.379
so, Mike'll sort of show
you what's going on,

10:35.413 --> 10:37.551
and then we could bugger
off out the claim and have
a look, ya know?

10:37.586 --> 10:39.655
We've got enough time
of the day, I think, yeah,
so, that'll be cool.

10:44.068 --> 10:45.551
'Kay, watch out,
coming through.

10:45.586 --> 10:49.206
<i>Jeff steps</i> <i>
in to take on Peter's</i> <i>
jobs at the workshop...</i>

10:49.241 --> 10:50.758
Fun to get my
hands dirty, always.

10:53.068 --> 10:56.310
<i>...freeing</i> <i>
him to show Parker,</i> <i>
Danny and Tyler</i>

10:56.344 --> 10:59.620
<i>the wash plant at his</i> <i>
gold mine 13 miles away.</i>

11:01.827 --> 11:02.758
There it is.

11:02.793 --> 11:03.896
Looks different.

11:03.931 --> 11:04.793
Oh, wow!

11:06.137 --> 11:08.413
<i>Isn't that interesting,</i> <i>
Parker? Floating wash plant.</i>

11:08.448 --> 11:09.758
<i>Yeah, it's very cool.</i>

11:12.310 --> 11:14.068
Oh, my [bleep],
check that out!

11:16.517 --> 11:17.931
That's crazy looking!

11:18.724 --> 11:19.965
How you doing?

11:20.000 --> 11:21.241
Doing good guys? Yeah!

11:21.275 --> 11:22.172
How cool's this?

11:22.206 --> 11:23.724
Yeah, this is our
floating plant.

11:24.620 --> 11:25.620
<i>Beautiful!</i>

11:26.965 --> 11:28.724
<i>So, they're</i> <i>
a traditional wash plant,</i>

11:28.758 --> 11:30.724
but basically like
a land-based plant,

11:30.758 --> 11:33.068
but it's on a floating
pontoon, so...

11:33.103 --> 11:36.379
It's like
if a dredge and a land
wash plant had a baby.

11:36.413 --> 11:38.068
Yeah!

11:38.103 --> 11:41.034
These plants are the most
efficient way of mining.

11:41.068 --> 11:43.379
- Wow.
- So, yeah, no, she's a pretty awesome piece of equipment.

11:44.827 --> 11:45.793
<i>That is cool.</i>

11:56.896 --> 11:59.344
How many people do
you need to operate it?

11:59.379 --> 12:01.241
<i>It's just a two-person</i> <i>
operation, really.</i>

12:01.275 --> 12:04.241
- Two?
- Yeah, two just run it nicely.

12:04.275 --> 12:06.896
<i>On the west coast
of New Zealand's south island,</i>

12:06.931 --> 12:10.137
<i>Parker gets his first</i> <i>
look at local miner,</i>

12:10.172 --> 12:12.965
<i>Peter Haddock's innovative</i> <i>
floating wash plant.</i>

12:15.551 --> 12:16.827
Has it sunk before?

12:16.862 --> 12:18.103
It has, Parker, yeah.

12:18.137 --> 12:19.896
Yeah, I've actually got
a photo here, actually.

12:19.931 --> 12:21.551
It's pretty horrific,
really, she's, uh...

12:21.586 --> 12:23.000
"It's pretty horrific really."

12:23.689 --> 12:24.655
Yeah, so, um--

12:24.689 --> 12:25.965
Oh, like,
properly upside down?

12:26.000 --> 12:27.551
Yeah, like,
completely upside down.

12:27.586 --> 12:28.724
How'd that happen?

12:28.758 --> 12:31.275
Well, had a new
fella on it at the time,

12:31.310 --> 12:33.000
he just overloaded the hopper.

12:33.034 --> 12:34.655
Holy [bleep]!

12:34.689 --> 12:36.862
And, of course,
that was us for a cabin,

12:36.896 --> 12:39.689
- but we had it actually back and operating in ten days.
- Wow.

12:39.724 --> 12:42.862
So, that's the horror story,
but they've been all over now.

12:42.896 --> 12:44.482
I'm just, I'm just
here for the carnage.

12:47.896 --> 12:49.482
How does
it work then?

12:49.517 --> 12:51.620
<i>They're, uh,</i> <i>
moved around by winches,</i>

12:51.655 --> 12:54.034
and, you know, he'll just
work his way across,

12:54.068 --> 12:56.103
they take a couple
meters at a time,

12:56.137 --> 12:58.103
and that just goes back
and forwards across the pond.

12:58.137 --> 13:01.448
It's like a mining typewriter.

13:05.310 --> 13:08.275
<i>Floating atop</i> <i>
a 14-foot deep pond,</i>

13:08.310 --> 13:13.241
<i>Peter's wash plant is</i> <i>
able to process 115 yards</i> <i>
of pay dirt an hour...</i>

13:15.310 --> 13:16.379
<i>...and excavate it.</i>

13:16.413 --> 13:19.551
<i>Feeds pay directly</i> <i>
into the plant's hopper</i>

13:19.586 --> 13:24.068
<i>while the tailings fill
in the pond on the other side.</i>

13:24.103 --> 13:27.482
<i>This superefficient system</i> <i>
uses anchors and winches</i>

13:27.517 --> 13:31.000
<i>to allow the plant to follow</i> <i>
the path of the excavator</i>

13:31.034 --> 13:33.137
<i>as it opens up new ground,</i>

13:33.172 --> 13:37.068
<i>eliminating the need</i> <i>
for rock trucks and loaders.</i>

13:37.103 --> 13:42.862
<i>Mining this way in Alaska</i> <i>
could save Parker hundreds</i> <i>
of thousands of dollars.</i>

13:42.896 --> 13:45.103
<i>You wanna go over
closer and have a bit of look?</i>

13:45.137 --> 13:46.448
Yeah,
that'd be great.

13:46.482 --> 13:48.068
We're gonna
ride the bucket, bud!

13:51.068 --> 13:53.068
I've never
done this before.

13:53.103 --> 13:54.310
Just don't
hold onto the pin.

13:55.689 --> 13:57.724
Whoa! Easy!

13:59.965 --> 14:01.448
Don't you dare!

14:06.448 --> 14:09.517
We use the,
uh, the old stumps for
anchors for our ropes.

14:09.551 --> 14:10.931
What about the winches?

14:10.965 --> 14:13.758
Oh the winches? Yeah,
well, we take the weight,

14:13.793 --> 14:15.241
make sure you got
a good weight on it,

14:15.275 --> 14:17.379
and then let it
round, ya know?

14:18.931 --> 14:20.758
Oh, yeah,
there we go!

14:21.827 --> 14:23.586
So, it's easy
to move around,

14:23.620 --> 14:26.620
and so it's all that
part of the efficiency
with the plant.

14:30.931 --> 14:32.758
So, what does
this burn for fuel?

14:33.793 --> 14:34.965
Oh, bugger all, really.

14:35.000 --> 14:39.068
This whole setup must run
for less than an ounce a day.

14:39.103 --> 14:42.413
- Uh, yeah, it's about a bit over an ounce a day.
- Is it?

14:42.448 --> 14:43.689
Yeah, yeah.

14:43.724 --> 14:46.517
But an economical operation
compared to have to truck wash

14:46.551 --> 14:48.344
to a plant, as you know
all about, ya know?

14:48.379 --> 14:51.413
Yeah, ours is, like,
an ounce an hour...

14:52.551 --> 14:53.448
...that we're spending.

14:53.482 --> 14:55.482
Huge difference.

14:56.655 --> 14:58.034
We're gonna hop off then.

14:58.068 --> 14:59.172
Thanks, buddy.

15:04.965 --> 15:07.896
<i>With a price</i> <i>
tag of $250,000...</i>

15:09.103 --> 15:11.620
<i>...this could be the perfect</i> <i>
plant for Parker...</i>

15:12.827 --> 15:14.689
Would you like to have go?

15:14.724 --> 15:16.206
- All right, sweet.
- Right-o!

15:16.241 --> 15:17.137
<i>But first...</i>

15:18.448 --> 15:20.103
<i>...he needs to put</i> <i>
it to the test.</i>

15:23.137 --> 15:24.310
How's it going?

15:24.344 --> 15:26.689
This is Parker,
so, um, hey, Parker's

15:26.724 --> 15:28.896
coming round looking
to float the gold stream ops.

15:28.931 --> 15:30.965
Do you mind
if I get some lessons?

15:31.000 --> 15:32.310
Is that all right?

15:32.344 --> 15:33.275
Yeah.

15:35.827 --> 15:38.586
It's pretty hard to,
uh, jig under water.

15:38.620 --> 15:40.517
Yeah, you can't
see where you digging.

15:40.551 --> 15:42.000
Yeah.

15:42.034 --> 15:43.413
And where'd
you leave off?

15:43.448 --> 15:45.241
- Pretty much straight in front of ya.
- Gotcha.

15:50.724 --> 15:52.827
I haven't done too much
digging under water,

15:52.862 --> 15:55.034
so, I'm probably gonna have,
like, no dirt in the bucket.

16:00.517 --> 16:01.793
Yeah.

16:03.344 --> 16:04.379
<i>A scoop of water.</i>

16:09.413 --> 16:12.482
<i>Production's gonna suffer</i> <i>with me at the controls.</i>

16:12.517 --> 16:14.379
- Probably should...
- You'll be all right.

16:14.413 --> 16:16.620
[Parker]...get it
figured out or give it
back to you in a hurry.

16:18.275 --> 16:19.689
- How's it going, guys?
- Yeah, good.

16:19.724 --> 16:21.068
Hey,
sorry about that,

16:21.103 --> 16:23.655
I just had a bloody
phone call, I gotta go
to a breakdown...

16:23.689 --> 16:25.275
- Oh, okay.
- ...up the road to fix something,

16:25.310 --> 16:27.793
so, uh, if you guys are
happy, then I'll scoot,

16:27.827 --> 16:29.724
- and I'll be back in half an hour, eh?
- Yeah.

16:29.758 --> 16:31.344
Good guys, okay.

16:31.379 --> 16:33.103
Keep those hours up,
that's the main thing.

16:33.827 --> 16:34.965
I'll catch ya's after.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.172
See ya later, Peter.

16:36.206 --> 16:37.724
- See ya, Danny.
- See ya in a bit, buddy.

16:37.758 --> 16:39.344
Take care. You keep a good
eye on them, Danny,

16:39.379 --> 16:41.724
- make sure they keep those bloody hours up.
- Don't worry, mate.

16:41.758 --> 16:43.103
- All right, bud.
- All right, buddy, see ya later.

16:47.862 --> 16:49.137
- Hello.
- Hey, how ya doing?

16:49.172 --> 16:50.827
- I'm Tyler.
- I'm Breegan, nice to meet you.

16:50.862 --> 16:51.862
Nice to meet you!

16:52.517 --> 16:53.827
Can we help in any way?

16:53.862 --> 16:55.827
Well, we have to do
a rope change soon,

16:55.862 --> 16:58.724
so, you could give
me a hand if you can.

16:58.758 --> 17:00.448
Definitely,
I can help with that.

17:00.482 --> 17:03.896
<i>To keep</i> <i>
the 38-ton wash plant</i> <i>
in reach of the pay,</i>

17:03.931 --> 17:06.862
<i>it's anchors need to be</i> <i>
moved every two days...</i>

17:06.896 --> 17:07.896
- Alrighty.
- Radio me.

17:07.931 --> 17:09.206
Yep.

17:09.241 --> 17:11.034
<i>...so Breegan</i> <i>
mans the winches</i>

17:11.068 --> 17:13.620
<i>while Tyler repositions</i> <i>
the anchor ropes.</i>

17:16.068 --> 17:17.000
Yeah.

17:18.689 --> 17:21.068
Yeah.
All right, Roger.

17:22.862 --> 17:25.275
Dan, I'm worried I'm not
gonna be able to get this off.

17:25.310 --> 17:28.241
<i>No, he's gonna loosen</i> <i>
it up, look, there you go.</i>

17:28.275 --> 17:30.103
That one on the far
side's loosened.

17:31.344 --> 17:32.206
<i>There you go.</i>

17:33.068 --> 17:33.862
<i>Loosen her off.</i>

17:38.206 --> 17:41.482
Come on, Ty, get the muscles going.

17:41.517 --> 17:44.000
Hang on. There we go.

17:44.034 --> 17:47.206
- Which tree? That one?
- I think he said that one,

17:47.241 --> 17:48.137
or that one there.

17:50.068 --> 17:51.137
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:51.172 --> 17:52.379
- That one?
- Yeah.

17:53.206 --> 17:54.344
Make this tight.

17:57.413 --> 17:59.965
- Put it on the tree. That one needs to go...
- Yeah.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.275
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no, no.

18:05.379 --> 18:07.620
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay. I've whacked my chin.

18:07.655 --> 18:11.517
- I know you did, I heard it.
- Yeah, that hurt.

18:11.551 --> 18:14.965
Let's have a look at your leg. Oh,

18:16.206 --> 18:18.344
That looks pretty bruised.

18:19.448 --> 18:20.965
Oh,

18:21.000 --> 18:22.206
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

18:24.862 --> 18:28.206
<i>Tyler fails to secure</i> <i>
the anchor rope in time.</i>

18:31.344 --> 18:34.724
<i>The wash plant</i> <i>
is drifting off course.</i>

18:34.758 --> 18:38.241
- Shall I try and grab the rope?
- Well, that's too far.

18:41.862 --> 18:43.241
Shut it off, Parker.
Shut it off.

18:43.862 --> 18:44.655
Rope's in the water.

18:51.448 --> 18:52.586
This is really embarrassing.

18:53.517 --> 18:55.103
I need it brought around.

18:56.758 --> 18:58.000
- You can get it, you can get it.
- reach that.

18:58.034 --> 19:00.172
How the [bleep]?
There's no ledge to go in.

19:00.206 --> 19:02.137
Could get a stick.
Get a stick.

19:02.172 --> 19:03.413
Yeah, get it. You get it.

19:06.137 --> 19:10.034
Yes. Well done, Ty. Yes.

19:10.068 --> 19:11.551
Well done.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.275
You don't
need to wind it up.

19:21.344 --> 19:23.551
Oh, good, I'll just do
all the hard labor.

19:23.586 --> 19:25.172
Yeah, that's right, you will.

19:25.206 --> 19:27.586
You want me
to treat you special
because you're a girl?

19:27.620 --> 19:29.862
No, I just thought as a friend
you'd help me out.

19:29.896 --> 19:31.896
You've got it.
It was a one man job.

19:38.517 --> 19:40.275
Bloody hell.
Move quicker.

19:40.310 --> 19:41.620
It was so heavy.

19:41.655 --> 19:42.965
I thought I was gonna
go in the water.

19:49.103 --> 19:51.275
I'm really sorry.
That was a rookie move.

19:52.517 --> 19:53.551
It happens. It's all good.

19:56.275 --> 19:59.931
Right, what do you need, Ben?
Do you want me to run that
round there again?

19:59.965 --> 20:01.827
Yeah, round that back around
to the front stump.

20:01.862 --> 20:03.448
- That big one?
- Yeah, the big one.

20:03.482 --> 20:04.655
All right, all right.

20:04.689 --> 20:06.551
Want me
to untangle that a bit?

20:06.586 --> 20:08.344
Haven't seen
that technique before.

20:12.172 --> 20:14.310
There we go. We're good.

20:15.793 --> 20:16.586
Oh.

20:20.827 --> 20:21.655
<i>Gotcha.</i>

20:21.689 --> 20:22.482
Here we go.

20:27.379 --> 20:29.482
Back in business. There we go.

20:30.965 --> 20:34.689
<i>After a 30 minute shutdown,</i> <i>
they're back on the gold.</i>

20:34.724 --> 20:36.517
<i>That took</i>
a long <i>time,</i> <i>
didn't it?</i>

20:37.896 --> 20:39.379
I feel so bad
What a show.

20:55.034 --> 20:59.172
Yeah, I'm glad
that we're, you know,
checking a floating plant out

20:59.206 --> 21:01.137
<i>because I've never really</i> <i>
spent any time around them.</i>

21:02.931 --> 21:05.034
<i>On New Zealand's</i> <i>
south island,</i>

21:05.068 --> 21:09.965
<i>Parker has one hour left</i> <i>
to test drive Peter Haddock's</i> <i>
floating wash plant</i>

21:10.000 --> 21:14.103
<i>and decide if</i> <i>
it's the plant he needs</i> <i>
for his new Alaska claim.</i>

21:16.655 --> 21:18.103
Yeah, I mean,
digging underwater

21:18.137 --> 21:21.827
<i>is definitely</i> <i>
a little bit weird</i> <i>
to get used to,</i>

21:21.862 --> 21:24.862
<i>because in the Yukon</i> <i>
we're doing it dry</i>

21:25.827 --> 21:29.965
and I can see
exactly what we're doing.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.275
<i>But, yeah, I mean,</i> <i>
the huge benefit in this</i>

21:33.310 --> 21:35.275
is it just costs
nothing to run, right?

21:35.310 --> 21:39.000
Like, you're digging it
straight out of the ground,
straight into a wash plant.

21:39.034 --> 21:44.413
And the trade off
for not being able
to see what you're doing

21:44.448 --> 21:47.965
is, you know,
a very efficient
mining system.

21:52.655 --> 21:54.344
Here he comes.

21:54.379 --> 21:56.965
<i>After fixing the issue</i> <i>
at his other site...</i>

21:57.000 --> 21:59.206
- How you doing?
- <i>Peter</i> <i>returns to the mine,</i>

21:59.241 --> 22:01.827
<i>bringing Jeff with him</i> <i>
from his workshop.</i>

22:03.586 --> 22:06.310
- What do you reckon, Jeff?
- Yeah, that's a nice machine. Really nice.

22:06.344 --> 22:07.344
Good, good.

22:08.724 --> 22:10.758
<i>Parker's been doing</i> <i>
a great job this afternoon,</i>

22:10.793 --> 22:14.000
<i>so yeah,</i> <i>
hopefully he wants one.</i>

22:18.724 --> 22:19.586
What do you reckon, Parker?

22:21.827 --> 22:24.275
- Pretty slick.
- It's really good, you know?

22:24.310 --> 22:26.965
No, it's a
great system really.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.689
Yeah, and I would
definitely get one, you know?

22:32.827 --> 22:37.275
But, well,
there's one big issue.

22:39.103 --> 22:40.413
How old is this unit?

22:41.310 --> 22:43.862
She's 38 years old this year.

22:45.655 --> 22:46.758
Wow.

22:48.586 --> 22:52.724
I really want a modern
high tech wash plant,

22:52.758 --> 22:55.586
so hopefully we can
see some other ones.

22:56.655 --> 22:58.758
Ones that are newer?

22:58.793 --> 23:01.103
Because I'd like
to see more of them.

23:01.137 --> 23:02.827
Well, I can tell you
we've just,

23:02.862 --> 23:06.275
this last year in 2021,
we bought a beautiful plant
up the road.

23:06.310 --> 23:07.896
Brand new,
much the same as this,

23:07.931 --> 23:10.034
but all really
modern technology.

23:10.068 --> 23:11.655
The winches are all controlled

23:11.689 --> 23:13.068
- from the excavator.
- Oh, wow.

23:13.965 --> 23:15.379
I could hook you up with a guy

23:15.413 --> 23:17.172
- and see if he's extra keen.
- That would be awesome, yeah.

23:17.206 --> 23:21.275
And could see if JD
will actually be keen
to meet you guys.

23:21.310 --> 23:22.551
- Cool.
- That would be amazing, yeah.

23:22.586 --> 23:23.586
Yeah,
it would be great, yeah.

23:23.620 --> 23:24.965
I'll grab some
contact details off you.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.551
Yep, that'll be great.
I'll give them to you.

23:26.586 --> 23:28.103
- Awesome. Thanks so much.
- All right.

23:28.137 --> 23:31.000
- Thank you, yeah.
- I feel like a tourist.

23:31.034 --> 23:33.620
I think it's
a really successful day.

23:33.655 --> 23:35.517
We managed to get
another contact out of it.

23:35.551 --> 23:37.241
<i>His name's JD,</i>

23:37.275 --> 23:41.517
<i>who apparently has</i> <i>
the best floating wash plant</i> <i>
in New Zealand.</i>

23:41.551 --> 23:43.206
Obviously,
it's been really good
seeing that,

23:43.241 --> 23:47.103
but if that's like
a very average SUV,

23:47.137 --> 23:49.068
the one that
we're gonna see tomorrow
is a Lamborghini.

23:59.758 --> 24:01.275
Today was a good day.

24:01.310 --> 24:03.172
- It was awesome.
- Wicked.

24:03.206 --> 24:05.034
There was a moment
where I was embarrassed

24:05.068 --> 24:06.827
to be a part of this group, Tyler.

24:10.310 --> 24:12.896
- I just got off the phone to JD.
- Yeah.

24:12.931 --> 24:16.862
He's not too sure
about showing us
his wash plant and mine site

24:16.896 --> 24:17.931
without meeting us.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.551
- Really?
- What?

24:21.586 --> 24:25.206
So if it's okay with you guys,
I said we'd go down
and meet up with him tomorrow,

24:25.241 --> 24:26.620
and then if
everything goes well

24:26.655 --> 24:27.896
he'll agree
to take us out there.

24:27.931 --> 24:29.931
- Are you okay with that, Parker?
- Mmm-hmm.

24:32.827 --> 24:34.965
Yeah, so we're
meeting JD tomorrow.

24:35.000 --> 24:38.034
He's a little cagey
about showing us
his mining operation,

24:38.068 --> 24:40.482
which I totally appreciate.

24:40.517 --> 24:43.724
He's extremely secretive,
from what I can gather,

24:43.758 --> 24:46.034
but I really want access
to this floating wash plant

24:46.068 --> 24:47.862
because it's
the creme de la creme.

24:47.896 --> 24:52.827
Hopefully it goes well
and he shows us his plants
and his mining operation.

24:52.862 --> 24:56.517
But for now it's bed time.

25:09.310 --> 25:12.793
Who is this mysterious
JD character then?

25:12.827 --> 25:15.172
- He is being a bit mysterious, isn't he?
- Yeah.

25:17.068 --> 25:20.310
In New Zealand, you know,
the gold game's
small and secretive,

25:20.344 --> 25:23.137
and everyone
likes to keep their cards
close to them.

25:23.172 --> 25:25.689
No, I mean, it makes sense.
You know, for me it's like

25:25.724 --> 25:31.068
I definitely wouldn't let
just anybody show up
with a camera crew

25:32.620 --> 25:34.517
on our mine site.

25:34.551 --> 25:37.965
<i>The trailblazing innovations</i> <i>
on JD's wash plant</i>

25:38.000 --> 25:41.862
<i>means he keeps its location</i> <i>
a well-guarded secret.</i>

25:41.896 --> 25:44.137
But yeah,
JD doesn't want to let us
on his mine site

25:44.172 --> 25:45.620
until we've met him.

25:45.655 --> 25:49.379
I'm feeling the pressure.
I feel like our character's
under analysis.

25:49.413 --> 25:53.793
Well, if that's the case then we're

25:53.827 --> 25:57.137
<i>He's asked them</i> <i>
to meet him on the banks</i> <i>
of the Kokatahi River.</i>

26:01.586 --> 26:03.413
- How's it going?
- Hello.

26:03.448 --> 26:05.551
- Good.
- Tyler, nice to finally meet you.

26:05.586 --> 26:07.620
- I know, nice to finally meet you too.
- Yeah.

26:07.655 --> 26:09.827
Yeah, I just like
to meet people
in person first,

26:09.862 --> 26:11.931
make sure you're
trustworthy enough
to come to site.

26:11.965 --> 26:13.620
Oh, so this is like
a stress test?

26:13.655 --> 26:15.689
Yeah,
a bit of a sort of
stress test.

26:17.724 --> 26:19.206
Yeah.

26:19.241 --> 26:20.310
Oh, man.

26:22.034 --> 26:24.413
What sort of speeds
are we talking about
in that?

26:24.448 --> 26:26.896
You're doing well over 100
past all the rocks.

26:26.931 --> 26:28.448
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

26:28.482 --> 26:30.517
That's crazy.

26:30.551 --> 26:33.241
I don't have
the greatest track record
with jet boats.

26:33.275 --> 26:35.275
Well, she only takes
two passengers,

26:35.310 --> 26:37.724
so couple of people
have got to draw
the short straw.

26:37.758 --> 26:40.379
- You gonna do that, Ty?
- Absolutely not.

26:40.413 --> 26:42.137
No.

26:42.172 --> 26:45.620
- Looks like it's you two up then, hey?
- Oh,

26:45.655 --> 26:46.620
This is a lot.

26:47.758 --> 26:49.586
My mouth's just suddenly
gone a bit dry.

26:52.068 --> 26:54.275
- I'm ready.
- Man.

26:55.241 --> 26:57.068
The things we do
to get on a mine site.

26:58.137 --> 27:01.862
hell. Holy

27:01.896 --> 27:04.551
- You're gonna be like this the whole time, aren't you?
- Yes.

27:04.586 --> 27:06.103
- You all right?
- Yeah.

27:06.137 --> 27:08.896
JD, you've got an evil glint
in your eye, man.

27:09.724 --> 27:11.724
Whoa!

27:11.758 --> 27:13.448
Oh, no.

27:22.689 --> 27:25.586
Split it. Yeah, baby.

27:25.620 --> 27:27.310
No.

27:58.275 --> 28:00.275
How long
do you reckon they'll be?

28:00.310 --> 28:02.517
I'd say at least
a couple of hours.
I don't know.

28:02.551 --> 28:04.103
- What?
- Yeah.

28:04.137 --> 28:06.551
So, what,
we're just gonna stand here
for a couple of hours?

28:06.586 --> 28:08.862
It's a pretty nice day.
I don't think they're gonna
be in any rush.

28:20.896 --> 28:24.000
Jeff said we wouldn't get wet.

28:24.034 --> 28:27.000
Oh.

28:28.310 --> 28:32.034
Oh, my

28:33.344 --> 28:35.275
Ah!

28:37.448 --> 28:39.965
Oh, mate.

28:43.241 --> 28:46.103
- Did you grow up doing this kind of stuff?
- Yeah.

28:46.137 --> 28:49.896
- Yeah, from 16 all me mates had 'em.
- All right. Yeah.

28:49.931 --> 28:53.620
We were always
motorbiking Saturday,
working Sunday.

28:53.655 --> 28:57.379
- What a playground.
- Amazing.

28:57.413 --> 28:59.448
Shall we go for a walk?
There's actually a bit of gold
just around here.

28:59.482 --> 29:00.379
- Oh, yeah?
- What?

29:00.413 --> 29:01.206
Yeah.

29:05.655 --> 29:07.068
How long have you been mining?

29:07.103 --> 29:09.862
I've been mining for 13 years.

29:09.896 --> 29:12.655
- Gotcha.
- And then I grew up around here too,

29:12.689 --> 29:18.275
so all these areas here
I was looking around with Dad
with the gold pan.

29:18.310 --> 29:22.137
- So, this little creek here has got gold in it.
- Oh, wow.

29:22.172 --> 29:25.137
- The only spot around here.
- Secret location.

29:26.068 --> 29:28.655
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's quartz.

29:28.689 --> 29:33.241
- So that's a quartz vein?
- Yeah.

29:33.275 --> 29:37.206
- That's where gold comes from, quartz veins.
- Oh, look.

29:37.241 --> 29:39.724
- You bring a gold pan?
- No.

29:41.379 --> 29:45.517
- Should have brought a gold pan, Dan.
- Oh, no, really?

29:45.551 --> 29:49.310
Rookie mistake, that.
Because we don't
have a gold pan.

29:50.379 --> 29:53.172
- Is there nuggets around here?
- There could be.

29:53.206 --> 29:55.931
- JD.
- What?

29:55.965 --> 29:58.241
Like, everything's,
like, guarded, innit?

30:09.034 --> 30:10.000
Yeah, let's do it.

30:13.103 --> 30:14.034
Yeah.

30:25.344 --> 30:26.620
Looks like
they're having fun.

30:26.655 --> 30:28.862
- You guys having fun?
- No, tons.

30:28.896 --> 30:31.068
- I feel really bad.
- Why?

30:31.103 --> 30:32.172
I actually
feel really terrible.

30:32.206 --> 30:33.379
I'm really sorry.

30:33.413 --> 30:34.965
- Yeah, right.
- It was awful.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.931
- JD.
- This thing is so slow.

30:36.965 --> 30:38.862
Thanks for showing us that.

30:38.896 --> 30:40.586
- Thanks so much, man.
- Yeah, no worries.

30:40.620 --> 30:42.517
- So they passed the test?
- Yeah.

30:42.551 --> 30:45.000
- Right on.
- See yous at the floater.

30:45.034 --> 30:46.344
- Sweet.
- Oh, nice.

30:46.379 --> 30:48.344
- All right.
- I feel guilty.

30:48.379 --> 30:50.517
- Don't feel guilty. As long as you had fun.
- No, I do feel guilty.

30:50.551 --> 30:51.896
- Don't feel guilty.
- I'm sorry.

30:51.931 --> 30:53.379
As long as you guys had fun.

30:53.413 --> 30:56.482

- Put some chairs out.
- Cocktails.

33:47.275 --> 33:49.655
Oh,
it's a bit noisy for that.

33:49.689 --> 33:53.344

water filter system too.

33:53.379 --> 33:57.344
- So it filters the water for the hydraulic ripples.
- Gotcha.

33:57.379 --> 34:00.310
Because hydraulic ripples
are really good
until they clog up.

34:00.344 --> 34:03.206
Right.

all ours out.

34:03.241 --> 34:06.206

got a camera up here
behind the trommel

34:06.241 --> 34:08.448
so you can see
if you get a jam
up on the stacker.

34:08.482 --> 34:11.482
Right. We just wait
'till there's three yards
of dirt piled up somewhere,

34:11.517 --> 34:13.758
- and then shut down, and get the shovels out.
- Yeah.

34:13.793 --> 34:16.275
You've got a solution
for everything.

34:17.034 --> 34:18.000
Yeah.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.275
<i>I haven't been around</i> <i>
a lot of floaters</i>

34:21.310 --> 34:23.344
<i>because we don't have</i> <i>
a lot of those in the Yukon,</i>

34:23.379 --> 34:26.827
but this is definitely
the nicest plant we've seen
this whole trip.

34:26.862 --> 34:30.758
So, are you
the only one in this area
with this exact wash plant?

34:30.793 --> 34:32.620
Yes, I think,
from what we can tell,

34:32.655 --> 34:33.931
it's the only one
in the world.

34:33.965 --> 34:35.586
- Only one in the world?
- Yeah.

34:35.620 --> 34:37.275
That's cool, hey?

34:37.310 --> 34:40.379
From what we can tell,
no one else controls it all
from the digger.

34:40.413 --> 34:43.896
- You've essentially done what we are setting out to do.
- Yeah.

34:43.931 --> 34:46.379
- Yeah.
- You know what I mean? Well, yeah, I mean, like,

34:46.413 --> 34:48.896
Parkers needs
the perfect machine

34:48.931 --> 34:50.724
- for the ground that he's got in Alaska.
- Yeah.

34:50.758 --> 34:52.379
- And you've done exactly that here, yeah.
- Your...

34:52.413 --> 34:53.206
Yeah.

34:54.310 --> 34:55.103
What do you think?

34:56.275 --> 34:57.275
sick.

34:58.586 --> 34:59.862
- That's cool.
- Yeah.

35:01.793 --> 35:04.000
I'm ready
to ship this thing to Alaska.

35:05.068 --> 35:07.034
This is perfect. I love it.

35:18.379 --> 35:20.517
So, have you mined all that?

35:20.551 --> 35:25.482
Yeah, so that's
where we started,
about 100 meters out there.

35:25.517 --> 35:28.344
We've mined down
and then we've come back
over all this,

35:28.379 --> 35:30.103
and that's all our restoration

35:31.206 --> 35:32.517
all ready for planting.

35:32.551 --> 35:34.586
- And then trees will get planted?
- Yeah.

35:36.689 --> 35:40.172
<i>New Zealand</i> <i>
has strict reclamation laws,</i>

35:40.206 --> 35:42.275
<i>and before permits</i> <i>
are granted,</i>

35:42.310 --> 35:46.620
<i>miners must have</i> <i>
funds set aside</i> <i>
for a rehabilitation plan</i>

35:46.655 --> 35:50.862
<i>approved by the local</i> <i>
environmental agencies.</i>

35:50.896 --> 35:52.827
Yeah, so you'll probably
come back here in,
like, 18 months,

35:52.862 --> 35:54.551
and it won't even look like
it's been mined.

35:54.586 --> 35:56.931
- No. No, you won't be able to tell.
- Sweet.

35:56.965 --> 35:58.724
And the beautiful thing
about floating

35:58.758 --> 36:01.034
is a very good,
and well managed,

36:01.068 --> 36:02.862
and environmentally friendly
way of mining.

36:02.896 --> 36:06.068
And, of course,
we don't want to not
look after the environment.

36:06.103 --> 36:08.275
And we don't do it
just because we have to,
we do it because we want to.

36:17.655 --> 36:19.896
- You can jump on the digger and have a go.
- Awesome.

36:22.448 --> 36:25.620
<i>On the west coast
of New Zealand's south island,</i>

36:25.655 --> 36:28.724
<i>Parker is testing</i> <i>
what could be</i> <i>
the perfect wash plant</i>

36:28.758 --> 36:30.758
<i>for his new claim</i> <i>
back in Alaska.</i>

36:44.413 --> 36:45.310
This one down?

36:58.034 --> 36:59.103
Gotcha.

37:03.689 --> 37:05.793
- What do you reckon of all this?
- Pretty sweet.

37:05.827 --> 37:07.448
Yeah.

37:07.482 --> 37:09.827
- Sweet. We all happy? Okay.
- Oh, yeah. Thanks, man.

37:09.862 --> 37:11.827
- Thanks for the lesson.
- No worries.

37:16.896 --> 37:18.344
<i>I've been on</i> <i>
a lot of wash plants</i>

37:18.379 --> 37:21.413
<i>and this is probably</i> <i>
the nicest one ever.</i>

37:21.448 --> 37:26.344
Like, probably one of the more
high-tech wash plants
in the world, really.

37:29.724 --> 37:32.241
<i>I mean, floating plants</i> <i>
have always seemed</i> <i>
a bit clunky to me,</i>

37:32.275 --> 37:36.310
but JD's solved that
with all of the controls
being in the cab.

37:36.344 --> 37:39.172
Like, it's actually
an unreal system.

37:41.275 --> 37:43.379
<i>From the cab</i> <i>
of the excavator,</i>

37:43.413 --> 37:47.241
<i>Parker can control</i> <i>
both the plant's movement</i> <i>
and its water pumps</i>

37:47.275 --> 37:48.827
<i>with just a flick of a switch.</i>

37:50.448 --> 37:54.655
Yesterday, when we were
on Peter Haddock's
he had manual-style winches,

37:54.689 --> 37:57.758
- Yeah.
- and this one's set up with hydraulic winches

37:57.793 --> 37:59.758
that he can
control from the cab.

37:59.793 --> 38:02.620
So they really
thought this plant out.

38:02.655 --> 38:05.620
Yeah, I mean this plant's
definitely given me
a lot to think about.

38:05.655 --> 38:08.758
It's super simple,
one-man operation.

38:11.620 --> 38:13.482
One of the only wash plants
I've ever been around

38:13.517 --> 38:14.896
that I've actually
enjoyed running.

38:17.482 --> 38:19.000
It's really impressive, actually.

38:23.448 --> 38:25.482
- All good, Parker?
- Yeah.

38:25.517 --> 38:28.379
- We'll shut it off and go for a beer.
- Okay.

38:28.413 --> 38:30.379
Are we gonna do a cleanup?

38:30.413 --> 38:34.103
I'll be doing a cleanup.

38:34.137 --> 38:37.310
- The camera guys will be going.
- Oh, really?

38:37.344 --> 38:39.931
- Yeah.
- Can we get the footage from your cameras

38:39.965 --> 38:40.827
on the actual...

38:40.862 --> 38:42.758
- No.
- No?

38:42.793 --> 38:45.172
It's definitely been
a theme so far

38:45.206 --> 38:48.655
that the Kiwis don't want us
to see their gold,
which is fine.

38:48.689 --> 38:50.275
We just have to move forward
and keep going.

38:51.206 --> 38:52.724
Parker, this is it.
Moment of truth.

38:54.344 --> 38:57.275
<i>Park now faces</i> <i>
a critical decision.</i>

38:57.310 --> 39:00.517
<i>Is JD's plant right</i> <i>
for the rugged terrain,</i>

39:00.551 --> 39:03.758
<i>high in the tundra</i> <i>
of Fairbanks, Alaska?</i>

39:05.689 --> 39:08.103
- Oh, what do you think?
- It's one of the coolest,

39:08.137 --> 39:10.931
- cleanest setups I've ever seen.
- Yeah.

39:10.965 --> 39:12.655
- Yeah?
- You really did think of everything.

39:14.655 --> 39:17.448
- I want one of those. Yeah.
- You want a new screen?

39:18.448 --> 39:19.862
<i>You get this huge advantage</i>

39:19.896 --> 39:23.000
- in just how cheap it is to run.
- Yeah.

39:23.034 --> 39:24.689
But then the big disadvantage

39:24.724 --> 39:26.931
in not seeing
what you're digging.

39:26.965 --> 39:30.655
Yeah, so that's where
this is quite nice,
good floating ground.

39:30.689 --> 39:33.068
- We've got a real flat, hard bottom,
- Right.

39:33.103 --> 39:35.931
so it does match up
quite nicely.

39:35.965 --> 39:37.931
And the biggest problem
in the Yukon, like,

39:37.965 --> 39:40.275
so after our pits
are done mined

39:40.310 --> 39:42.862
- it's, like, a bombing zone,
- Yeah.

39:42.896 --> 39:44.620
right, of just,
like, huge holes.

39:44.655 --> 39:47.724
And because
the ground's frozen
and it's all permafrost,

39:47.758 --> 39:52.655
a lot of the bigger holes
will have frozen gravel
in the bottom of them

39:52.689 --> 39:55.344
- Yeah.
- that you have to go back in for.

39:55.379 --> 39:58.379
- Right? Right.
- So you got to leave it and let it thaw.

39:58.413 --> 40:02.896
I would imagine
there's not really
a way to do it

40:02.931 --> 40:06.862
- in which you didn't leave that behind, right?
- Yeah.

40:06.896 --> 40:11.517
And if the bottom had been
all over the place,

40:11.551 --> 40:12.931
you would have done it,

40:12.965 --> 40:15.448
- had to probably do it dry, huh?
- Yeah, correct.

40:19.586 --> 40:21.000
Well, you've given me
a lot to think about.

40:24.413 --> 40:27.068
That dredge was amazing.

40:27.103 --> 40:33.586
But... we're not on ground
that it makes sense for
right now, I don't think.

40:35.827 --> 40:37.689
So it won't fit for Fairbanks,

40:37.724 --> 40:39.896
- but thanks for showing us that.
- Yeah.

40:39.931 --> 40:41.655
- Yeah, thanks so much, man.
- Thank you.

40:41.689 --> 40:44.068
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Definitely something to be proud of.

40:49.517 --> 40:52.448
<i>Even though we're not</i> <i>
walking away from here</i> <i>
with that wash plant,</i>

40:52.482 --> 40:54.482
<i>if nothing else I think</i> <i>
it makes Parker think,</i>

40:54.517 --> 40:57.758
"I want a machine
which is as fit for purpose,

40:57.793 --> 40:59.689
for the ground
that's in Alaska,

40:59.724 --> 41:02.620
that this one is
to the ground that's here."

41:05.137 --> 41:08.448
The ground in Fairbanks
is just not floating ground,

41:09.793 --> 41:12.551
<i>but of all</i> <i>
the plants I've seen</i>

41:12.586 --> 41:15.448
that one makes me
think most about, like,

41:15.482 --> 41:17.896
really changing up
our mining style

41:17.931 --> 41:19.344
if we find
another piece of ground

41:19.379 --> 41:20.689
that it would suit.

41:22.379 --> 41:23.793
<i>It's a real shame</i> <i>
that this plant</i>

41:23.827 --> 41:25.310
won't work in Alaska
because of the ground,

41:25.344 --> 41:27.103
but yeah, I bet if it did

41:27.137 --> 41:28.172
Parker would have one
in a heartbeat.

41:29.827 --> 41:31.620
<i>This has really set the tone,</i> <i>
moving forward,</i>

41:31.655 --> 41:34.000
<i>about what kind of</i> <i>
innovation and technology</i> <i>
we want to see.</i>
