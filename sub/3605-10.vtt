MR. BENNET:
Previously on Heroes.

00:03.087 --> 00:04.076
I'm going home.

00:04.172 --> 00:05.833
I'm scared
for my life, okay?

00:05.965 --> 00:07.626
I know.
Do you?

00:08.509 --> 00:09.498
Gretchen.

00:09.594 --> 00:11.050
I'm just not like you.

00:12.847 --> 00:15.964
LAUREN: And this thing here,
just pretend
it never happened, okay?

00:16.058 --> 00:17.184
I'm Haitianing you.

00:17.685 --> 00:21.598
We're pretending
that we've never been
to the Burnt Toast Diner?

00:23.566 --> 00:25.522
I came to warn you, Peter.
You need to know the truth.

00:25.610 --> 00:27.976
The answer you seek
is here.

00:28.404 --> 00:29.610
What do you got?
It's a body.

00:29.697 --> 00:30.732
What is it?

00:30.823 --> 00:32.029
It's me.

00:32.491 --> 00:34.652
One touch, Nathan,
and it's over.

00:34.744 --> 00:37.406
No! Don't touch him.
You touch him,
he's got my power,

00:37.496 --> 00:38.872
his mind will go back
into his body.

00:38.956 --> 00:40.332
Take my hand.
Do it now.

00:40.416 --> 00:41.622
I said get away!

00:41.709 --> 00:42.744
Back away!

00:43.419 --> 00:46.502
I need you to go back
eight weeks, Hiro.
To a motel room in Texas.

00:46.631 --> 00:47.620
HIRO: To save his life?
SAMUEL: No.

00:47.715 --> 00:49.626
To save that film,
before he destroyed it.

00:49.717 --> 00:53.380
Once you return,
deliver it to me, your sweet
Charlie will be set free.

00:53.471 --> 00:56.304
You have your film.
Now I want Charlie.

00:56.390 --> 00:57.505
Soon.

00:59.477 --> 01:01.388
This is entry number four.

01:01.479 --> 01:07.566
When two or more
of these forces are proximate,
they amplify exponential/y.

01:07.652 --> 01:10.644
Like a kind of
gravity or magnetism.

01:10.738 --> 01:14.356
An abnormal spike
in seismic activity
as of late

01:14.867 --> 01:19.236
appears to be emanating
from one of the individuals
being held here.

01:19.538 --> 01:20.789
A pregnant woman,
by the name of...

01:20.873 --> 01:22.079
N U RSE: Doctor,
he’s crowning.

01:22.166 --> 01:24.202
And / fear...

01:24.293 --> 01:27.456
I fear that this child
may indeed...

01:27.546 --> 01:28.877
(RUMBLING ON SCREEN)

01:30.341 --> 01:31.831
(BABY CRYING ON SCREEN)

01:32.593 --> 01:36.256
I’m coming.
It’s okay.
It’s okay.

01:36.347 --> 01:37.883
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

01:38.516 --> 01:42.225
Butterfly Man, open up.
You can't avoid me.

01:43.396 --> 01:46.388
I can see you're in there.
Open up!

01:47.358 --> 01:48.347
(SIGHING)

01:48.442 --> 01:51.058
HIRO: You are in there,
I know. Come out.

01:52.280 --> 01:54.020
Butterfly Man!

01:56.367 --> 01:58.733
Hiro, is that you
making all that noise?

01:58.869 --> 01:59.904
I've done what you asked.

02:00.037 --> 02:03.529
Now, please tell me
where and when
you put Charlie.

02:04.583 --> 02:06.164
It's beautiful out,
isn't it?

02:07.086 --> 02:08.576
Makes a man
glad to be alive.

02:08.921 --> 02:12.038
It feels poetic
that today is the day
we give thanks.

02:12.133 --> 02:14.374
Stop ignoring me,
Butterfly Man.
I want Charlie.

02:14.468 --> 02:17.335
And you will have her,
but there are more
pressing matters to discuss.

02:17.430 --> 02:21.548
That film that you retrieved
has brought
everything into focus.

02:21.767 --> 02:25.305
I've discovered
the truth about my destiny.
Our destiny.

02:27.106 --> 02:29.313
Give me Charlie.

02:29.400 --> 02:31.231
Sorry, not yet.

02:33.404 --> 02:36.237
UNJAPANESE)

02:38.409 --> 02:40.821
There's a nice sharp ax
right over there.

02:40.911 --> 02:43.163
Go on. Freeze time.
Chop me into bits.

02:43.247 --> 02:45.283
No, that's right,
you can't.

02:45.416 --> 02:48.783
'Cause if you kill me,
you'll never find Charlie.

02:50.421 --> 02:51.501
UNJAPANESE)

02:53.466 --> 02:56.924
I'm your savior, Hiro.
You just don't know it yet.

02:57.261 --> 02:59.422
Now, go help
set the table.

03:00.639 --> 03:03.096
And smile.
lt's Thanksgiving.

03:06.312 --> 03:07.301
(DOOR CLOSING)

03:07.938 --> 03:10.270
MR. BENNET: So,
when should I expect you?

03:10.608 --> 03:11.768
CLAIRE: /don't know.

03:11.859 --> 03:13.224
Oh, you've got to come.

03:13.319 --> 03:15.105
Happy Thanksgiving.

03:20.326 --> 03:22.612
| just don't know
that I'm in the mood.

03:22.703 --> 03:24.910
Come on.
You can invite Gretchen.

03:24.997 --> 03:30.458
Actually, I can't.
She moved all the way
across campus.

03:31.128 --> 03:35.246
I'm sorry to hear that.
And that's my fault,
isn't it?

03:35.800 --> 03:38.883
It's okay.
It wasn't going to
work out anyway.

03:39.136 --> 03:42.674
So, I guess it's official.
I'm a social pariah.

03:42.807 --> 03:45.765
And I haven't helped
things much.
I want to make it up to you,

03:45.851 --> 03:48.433
starting with a real
Bennet family
Thanksgiving dinner.

03:48.521 --> 03:51.433
Turkey trimmings,
the whole thing.
What do you say?

03:51.524 --> 03:53.480
And since when
do you cook?

03:53.567 --> 03:57.059
Well, you know,
I’m learning as / go.
Is that a yes?

03:58.072 --> 04:00.688
I don't know.
Is Lyle coming?

04:00.825 --> 04:03.487
No. He sends his regrets.
He can't get away from school.

04:03.577 --> 04:07.286
Don't make me be alone
with your mother and Doug.

04:07.373 --> 04:09.034
She's bringing
the new boyfriend?

04:09.166 --> 04:10.702
She never goes
anywhere without him.

04:10.835 --> 04:13.326
It would mean
a lot to me, Claire.

04:14.588 --> 04:15.794
Okay.

04:16.340 --> 04:19.082
There's something
I've been meaning to talk
to you about anyway.

04:19.176 --> 04:22.668
Great. I'll see you at 4:30,
don't be late. Love you.

04:27.852 --> 04:29.092
WOMAN: Noah?

04:30.688 --> 04:31.894
(CHUCKLING)
Oh, my God.

04:31.981 --> 04:32.936
Lauren.

04:33.023 --> 04:35.765
Of all the supermarkets
in all the towns
in all the world...

04:35.860 --> 04:37.725
It's great to see you.

04:37.820 --> 04:38.855
You, too.

04:39.864 --> 04:42.196
What are you doing
in Washington?

04:42.283 --> 04:45.025
Well, after Primatech
exploded, lwas
kind of unemployed.

04:45.119 --> 04:47.405
CIA seemed like
the obvious choice.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.282
And you?

04:49.373 --> 04:53.366
You know, little bit of this,
little bit of that.
Mostly that.

04:53.586 --> 04:54.826
I got a place
in Dupont Circle.

04:54.920 --> 04:58.412
Nice. What brings you
to this side of town?

05:00.551 --> 05:02.382
These yams,
these canned yams.

05:02.470 --> 05:05.928
I love them,
and I can't get them
anywhere else.

05:06.223 --> 05:08.839
Hmm, didn't peg you
for a yam man.

05:09.518 --> 05:11.634
Oh, yeah, big yam man.

05:18.444 --> 05:23.154
Yes, but I am also cooking
Thanksgiving dinner for
my daughter and my ex-wife.

05:23.240 --> 05:24.320
Ex-wife?

05:24.408 --> 05:25.818
Yeah, Sandra left me.

05:25.910 --> 05:27.650
Can't say as
I really blame her,

05:27.745 --> 05:28.825
but we're still
on good terms.

05:28.913 --> 05:31.450
I mean, hence
the over-sized bird.

05:31.916 --> 05:34.202
Are you having
Thanksgiving
on Christmas?

05:34.293 --> 05:37.831
Because this frozen beast
is not going to thaw
until tomorrow.

05:37.922 --> 05:40.629
You need one of those
already-cooked birds.

05:40.716 --> 05:41.831
Oh...

05:42.301 --> 05:43.791
Okay.

05:43.886 --> 05:45.217
Follow me.

05:47.097 --> 05:49.088
Thanks.
I appreciate it.

05:49.600 --> 05:53.843
Because I'm not
exactly an expert
in life skills.

05:54.438 --> 05:56.178
How many people?

05:56.273 --> 06:00.186
Four. Five,
if you would
like tojoin us.

06:00.277 --> 06:03.769
That is, if you don't
already have plans.

06:04.281 --> 06:08.194
And by the way
you're sizing up my
single-serve turkey pot pie,

06:08.285 --> 06:11.618
you've already surmised
that I don't have plans.

06:11.956 --> 06:14.288
It would be great
to catch up.

06:20.297 --> 06:21.628
(GASPS)

06:33.310 --> 06:34.891
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

06:48.826 --> 06:50.236
Happy Thanksgiving.

06:50.327 --> 06:51.737
Mom, what are you...

06:52.204 --> 06:54.320
Please set up
in there, boys.

06:54.415 --> 06:56.406
What is this?
Where's your brother, honey?

06:56.500 --> 06:58.491
That's a good question.

07:00.045 --> 07:03.082
Would you please
put these in a bowl
for me?

07:03.507 --> 07:05.293
We need to talk.
Yes, I know.

07:05.384 --> 07:07.500
That's what
Thanksgiving
is all about.

07:07.636 --> 07:11.845
Just families
sharing our lives.
Thank you, gentlemen.

07:12.725 --> 07:14.932
Okay, and please remember
to stir some milk into that.

07:15.019 --> 07:17.806
That's the way
your brother likes it.

07:22.401 --> 07:26.815
Went to a storage unit
yesterday, Mom.
Rented out to you.

07:29.158 --> 07:31.194
Saw Nathan's dead body.

07:35.539 --> 07:37.575
Rene told you about that.

07:39.376 --> 07:40.456
Well,

07:41.587 --> 07:44.169
it was not your
brother's body you saw.

07:44.256 --> 07:47.748
It was a shape-shifter
posing as your brother.

07:48.385 --> 07:50.501
It's the worst kind
of identity theft,

07:50.596 --> 07:53.759
and he had to be stopped,
and then we had to
store him away discreetly.

07:53.891 --> 07:56.758
You can imagine,
if the press
had gotten wind.

07:56.894 --> 07:58.259
Matt Parkman
also said that...

07:58.354 --> 08:00.561
Matt Parkman said what?

08:03.233 --> 08:07.818
Officer Parkman
is unbalanced.
Suicidal, last I heard.

08:07.905 --> 08:10.066
Because Sylar's
in his head?

08:11.283 --> 08:12.398
Is that right?

08:15.120 --> 08:16.951
What did you do, Ma?

08:21.585 --> 08:23.997
Is my brother
really dead?

08:24.088 --> 08:25.578
NATHAN: Answer him, Mom.

08:27.091 --> 08:29.423
We'd all like
to hear that one.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.092
Happy Thanksgiving, Nathan.

08:32.971 --> 08:35.678
So, if you two
will just help me
set the table,

08:35.766 --> 08:39.884
we will sit down
like a family, and we will
discuss everything.

08:40.354 --> 08:41.719
Owl

08:42.648 --> 08:44.604
Let go of me, Nathan.

08:47.069 --> 08:48.309
Answer him.

08:49.321 --> 08:51.607
lt's Thanksgiving
and you are my family.

08:51.740 --> 08:54.322
And we will sit down
like a family
as we do every year,

08:54.451 --> 08:58.285
or I will leave here
and you will never
hear from me again.

08:58.664 --> 09:00.154
Your choice.

09:35.576 --> 09:37.112
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

09:50.674 --> 09:51.663
Hello.

09:51.759 --> 09:52.874
Hey, Happy Thanksgiving.

09:53.010 --> 09:54.546
(EXCLAIMING)
Come on in.

09:54.636 --> 09:56.422
Something
smells good.

09:56.680 --> 10:00.093
Look at this place.
Are you sure
this is your apartment?

10:00.184 --> 10:04.177
We clean up good.
So, what can I get you?
Some sparkling cider?

10:04.271 --> 10:06.353
No, I'm all right,
but before
everyone gets here

10:07.941 --> 10:10.808
Okay, just let me check
the gravy first, okay?

10:10.903 --> 10:12.359
Oh, I got that.

10:12.780 --> 10:16.773
Claire, you remember Lauren?
She worked with me
at Primatech.

10:17.534 --> 10:19.035
Uh... Hi.

10:19.119 --> 10:21.861
Hi, you're all grown up.
You look beautiful.

10:22.039 --> 10:24.200
It's okay,
I got this,
VVngang.

10:24.291 --> 10:25.371
Thanks.

10:30.464 --> 10:32.125
Does Mom know
you brought a date?

10:32.216 --> 10:33.956
No,no,no,no,
Lauren's not a date.

10:34.051 --> 10:37.259
She's an old friend.
She's helping me cook.

10:39.556 --> 10:42.639
She is so a date.
You should have told Mom.

10:42.726 --> 10:44.091
Your mother
will understand.

10:44.228 --> 10:47.391
We're a complex,
modern family,

10:47.481 --> 10:49.346
and she's got Doug.

10:49.441 --> 10:50.726
So, what did you want
to talk about?

10:50.818 --> 10:52.354
(KNOCK AT DOOR)

10:52.736 --> 10:54.601
Hold that thought.

10:59.952 --> 11:01.817
Hi.
Mr. Muggles.

11:01.912 --> 11:03.493
Hey, Happy Thanksgiving.

11:03.580 --> 11:04.660
You, too.

11:04.748 --> 11:06.284
Good boy.

11:07.167 --> 11:10.079
Hi, Noah,
Happy Thanksgiving.
A host gift.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.582
Thanks, Doug.
Come on in.

11:13.674 --> 11:14.914
Hi, how are you?

11:15.008 --> 11:17.499
Hi. Good, good.
Who's your
little friend?

11:17.594 --> 11:19.801
Dame Penelope
Jean Lovegood lll,

11:19.888 --> 11:21.424
but you can call her
Miss Lovegood.

11:21.515 --> 11:24.427
Can't she, Schnookums?
Yes, she can.
Yes, she can.

11:24.518 --> 11:26.679
SANDRA: Claire,
you remember Doug.

11:26.770 --> 11:27.885
Yeah, hi.

11:27.980 --> 11:29.561
(SPEAKING FRENCH)

11:30.607 --> 11:31.858
Dinner's ready,
everyone.

11:31.942 --> 11:33.273
You hired a cook?

11:33.360 --> 11:35.225
No, that's Lauren.

11:35.320 --> 11:40.610
Wow, mistaken for a domestic.
That certainly breaks the ice.

11:40.951 --> 11:44.614
Lauren Gilmore.
It's nice to finally
meet you, Sandra.

11:45.539 --> 11:47.279
Okay, let's eat.

11:47.958 --> 11:49.198
You brought a date?

11:49.293 --> 11:51.875
No, that's Lauren.

11:52.504 --> 11:55.621
Okay, who's hungry?
Got lots to eat. Come on.

11:58.635 --> 12:00.717
Not a fan
of Thanksgiving?

12:00.804 --> 12:02.169
I'm from Japan.

12:02.306 --> 12:05.218
We celebrate Kinro Kansha,
not Thanksgiving.

12:06.643 --> 12:09.180
What's the matter, Hiro?
You can talk to me,
we're family.

12:09.313 --> 12:10.928
I'm not part
of this family.

12:11.023 --> 12:12.934
I'm a prisoner.
No one's a prisoner here.

12:13.025 --> 12:14.936
Samuel broke his promise.

12:15.027 --> 12:17.689
I fixed the past,
but he won't
give me back Charlie.

12:17.821 --> 12:20.028
He's a liar
and an evil man.

12:28.749 --> 12:32.037
If the time traveler

12:47.434 --> 12:49.846

We need to talk.

Tell me, what did you do
when you fixed the past
for Samuel?

12:58.570 --> 13:03.439
I'm sorry, I cannot say.
Samuel might get mad
and Charlie's at stake.

You stay a minute, will you?

You know, Hiro,
we can help each other.

save his brother, Joseph?

You need to take me back.

Eight weeks ago
when a man
from the government

14:49.264 --> 14:50.845
came to the carnival
and murdered Joseph.

14:50.974 --> 14:51.963

I should...

Please, I need
to know the truth.

Oh, no.
You made us time travel.
We must go back.

that killed Joseph?

All right, brother.
But not here.

15:31.973 --> 15:35.636
Is this it?
Is this the night that
Joseph gets murdered?

15:36.645 --> 15:39.432
I don't know.
But it is very dangerous
to be here.

15:39.523 --> 15:42.014
We must go before
we step on a

are your manners?

15:56.081 --> 15:57.617

please say grace?

lt's Thanksgiving, Nathan.
It's the one day we should
express our gratitude.

16:03.046 --> 16:05.537
What do l have
to be grateful for?

16:06.466 --> 16:08.502
I'm dead. He knows it,
you know it.

16:08.593 --> 16:12.427
Why don't you tell us why,
put us all out of our misery?

16:14.307 --> 16:15.592
Tell us.

16:18.478 --> 16:23.472
I don't expect you
to understand or approve
of the decision I made,

16:23.567 --> 16:27.230
butlhope
you can keep an open mind
and not condemn it.

16:28.071 --> 16:30.232
Sylar was going to
kill the president.

16:30.323 --> 16:34.612
And you two had flown off
to stop him at that hotel
in Washington.

16:35.078 --> 16:37.490
And I had a dream
about you, Nathan.

16:37.581 --> 16:39.492
I saw you fighting
for your life.

16:39.916 --> 16:42.453
I also saw
Matt Parkman save you.

16:42.544 --> 16:45.661
But I panicked and
I went and found him

16:46.256 --> 16:48.588
and I dragged him
to the hotel.

16:48.675 --> 16:49.915
But by the time
we got there...

16:50.010 --> 16:52.171
l was already dead.

16:57.684 --> 16:59.800
I made Matt Parkman do it.

17:02.814 --> 17:05.806
This is the part
where | ask you
to forgive me.

17:05.942 --> 17:08.194
So that body
that we saw,

17:10.030 --> 17:11.691
that was Nathan.

17:14.034 --> 17:16.366
Technically, yes,

17:16.453 --> 17:20.537
but as far as
the world is concerned,
Nathan is still alive.

17:20.624 --> 17:21.909
Yeah, but I'm not me.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.661
It's your mind.

17:23.877 --> 17:25.742
They are your memories.

17:25.837 --> 17:29.796
You look exactly the same.
You are Nathan Petrelli.

17:29.883 --> 17:32.875
You are my son.
You're Peter's brother.

17:32.969 --> 17:35.631
And it's been
this way for months.

17:36.556 --> 17:40.970
And just because
you know the truth,
nothing has to change.

17:41.186 --> 17:43.643
We are still a family.

Yes, clear.

only so many times.

of my favorite people.

40:24.798 --> 40:26.459
But you are.

40:27.634 --> 40:29.340
So, which way?

40:34.099 --> 40:35.600
Take a right.

40:40.981 --> 40:42.812
You saved Edgar.

40:43.358 --> 40:44.643
How honorable.

40:45.277 --> 40:49.020
Of course, when you
betray me, you put
Charlie in danger.

40:53.201 --> 40:58.286
Your brother was right.
You are powerful,
but I am powerful, too.

41:01.126 --> 41:03.412
I'll make it so
you never see her again.

41:03.503 --> 41:05.004
You won't do that.

41:05.088 --> 41:06.624
You still need me.

41:06.715 --> 41:10.128
So, you tell me exactly
when and where Charlie is.

41:10.427 --> 41:13.919
Or I am leaving.
And you will be the one
who is lost.

41:14.014 --> 41:17.347
I like this. Little man
standing up for himself.

41:18.185 --> 41:20.517
But you don't actually
think I'd ever
let you leave, do you?

41:20.604 --> 41:21.639
You don't have a choice.

41:21.730 --> 41:23.937
I always have a choice.

41:42.876 --> 41:44.832
How do you feel, Hiro?

41:46.380 --> 41:47.836
UNJAPANESE)

41:55.597 --> 41:57.303
What have you done?

42:00.102 --> 42:03.435
Look, I'm gonna find him,
and I'm gonna
bring him back, Mom.

42:03.522 --> 42:04.853
It's over.

42:05.273 --> 42:07.184
It isn't possible anymore.

42:07.275 --> 42:09.357
The one thing I know,

42:09.653 --> 42:12.395
the one thing I can count on
since all this started,

42:12.489 --> 42:14.320
is that anything
is possible.

42:14.408 --> 42:15.443
Sylar.

42:15.534 --> 42:17.946
Nobody wants him dead
more than me.

42:18.328 --> 42:20.569
You wanna know
what I want even more?

42:20.664 --> 42:21.995
My brother alive.

42:24.000 --> 42:25.865
I'll find a way.
