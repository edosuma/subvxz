WEBVTT

00:01.302 --> 00:03.269
- 'cause that's the guy
that should be doing all this,

00:03.303 --> 00:04.770
Giving you rides everywhere.

00:04.805 --> 00:07.039
- Maybe it'd be more efficient
if you were my boyfriend.

00:07.074 --> 00:08.240
- Got luke here, a new player.

00:08.275 --> 00:10.242
Y'all make sure
that he is welcome.

00:10.277 --> 00:11.410
- You're a long way
from home, boy.

00:11.445 --> 00:12.712
- I guess so.

00:12.746 --> 00:14.413
- I'm julie,
matt's girlfriend.

00:14.448 --> 00:16.148
- So you're the ball and chain
that keeps dragging him down.

00:16.183 --> 00:18.584
- Do you think
I'm holding you back?

00:18.619 --> 00:20.486
- No, you're the most important
thing in my life.

00:20.520 --> 00:22.655
- If you can't finish games,
I can't keep this program going.

00:22.689 --> 00:25.257
You turn it around,
or we gonna shut it down.

00:25.292 --> 00:26.425
[cheering]

00:26.460 --> 00:28.694
- Vince howard
puts the lions on the board

00:28.729 --> 00:30.262
For their first touchdown.

00:30.297 --> 00:32.598
[cheering]

00:37.037 --> 00:39.071
- It's still
a sad state of affairs

00:39.105 --> 00:40.506
For the panthers.

00:40.540 --> 00:41.573
In a single week,

00:41.608 --> 00:42.875
The team got a forfeit
on the books,

00:42.909 --> 00:45.677
And a great player,
luke cafferty,

00:45.712 --> 00:47.012
Shipped out of school.

00:47.046 --> 00:48.213
Callers, you say what?

00:48.248 --> 00:49.815
- Sammy, I got to correct you
on something.

00:49.849 --> 00:51.750
That cafferty kid
wasn't shipped out.

00:51.784 --> 00:53.852
He was hand-delivered
by principal taylor

00:53.887 --> 00:56.722
To east dillon,
her husband's team,

00:56.756 --> 00:57.923
And everybody knows it.

00:57.957 --> 01:01.627
- [sighs]

01:01.661 --> 01:02.895
- Taylor.

01:02.929 --> 01:05.864
- Good morning, levi.

01:05.899 --> 01:09.067
- I see you finished
the game last night,

01:09.102 --> 01:10.602
Way to go.

01:10.637 --> 01:13.205
Sis boom bah.
Rah, rah, rah.

01:13.239 --> 01:15.874
- Hey, levi.
- Huh?

01:15.909 --> 01:19.077
- Pep rallies...

01:19.112 --> 01:20.512
They build excitement.

01:20.547 --> 01:23.415
They're good for the school,
good for the team.

01:23.449 --> 01:26.218
- Pep rallies
don't cost, correct?

01:26.252 --> 01:28.587
- Nope.

01:28.621 --> 01:31.657
- Good.
Don't let me get in your way.

01:34.227 --> 01:36.395
- Come on, how much
retyping you got to do?

01:36.429 --> 01:39.965
Just put your test scores in,
tell them how awesome you are,

01:39.999 --> 01:41.500
And we can move along.

01:41.534 --> 01:42.701
- It's too long.

01:42.735 --> 01:44.303
I have to cut it down
at least by half.

01:44.337 --> 01:46.405
Did you hear that brown
used to make you

01:46.439 --> 01:48.640
Handwrite your essays?
- Wow.

01:48.675 --> 01:51.543
Well, that's so that they could
weed out the serial killers.

01:51.578 --> 01:54.279
- [chuckles]

01:54.314 --> 01:56.882
- So what's the, uh--what's
the final list of schools?

01:56.916 --> 01:58.817
- Um...

01:58.851 --> 02:01.987
U.C. Berkeley,
u.C.S.B.,

02:02.021 --> 02:04.690
Brown, amherst,

02:04.724 --> 02:08.060
Um, mount holyoke,

02:08.094 --> 02:10.762
N.Y.U.,

02:10.797 --> 02:12.965
U.T. Austin--

02:12.999 --> 02:14.633
Hook 'em horns.

02:14.667 --> 02:16.335
[chuckles]

02:22.041 --> 02:23.775
- Good splits, good splits!

02:23.810 --> 02:25.544
Come off the ball, now.
Come off the ball.

02:25.578 --> 02:27.579
- Step up.
Come on up.

02:27.614 --> 02:29.982
- Fumble!
- Oh, man.

02:30.016 --> 02:31.316
- Come on, now, 5.

02:31.351 --> 02:33.118
- Get it together out there.
- What are you doing?

02:33.152 --> 02:34.353
- Do you know how to read
the "d," man.?

02:34.387 --> 02:35.454
Read the end, dude.

02:35.488 --> 02:36.688
- That defensive end
didn't move.

02:36.723 --> 02:38.023
- He did move.
You're supposed to take him.

02:38.057 --> 02:39.791
- Next time, give me the ball
and get out my way.

02:39.826 --> 02:41.126
- Come here, come here.
Shut up.

02:41.160 --> 02:43.929
Shut your mouth.
Come here.

02:43.963 --> 02:46.298
You read the end.
You stay in the pitch lane.

02:46.332 --> 02:48.433
You keep your personal crap
off this field,

02:48.468 --> 02:50.168
And you quit
letting me down

02:50.203 --> 02:51.670
And quit letting
the team down,

02:51.704 --> 02:53.839
'cause we are all
getting tired of it.

02:53.873 --> 02:55.307
Is that understood?
- Yes, sir.

02:55.341 --> 02:57.776
- Yes, sir.

02:57.810 --> 03:01.046
- Let's go, now.
Come on.

03:01.080 --> 03:02.648
- All right, huddle up.

03:02.682 --> 03:04.049
Let's go.
Get in the huddle.

03:04.083 --> 03:06.785
Good jab step, three-two.
Good jab step.

03:06.819 --> 03:08.520
Good fake in there.
Now let's go.

03:08.554 --> 03:09.855
Right there.

03:09.889 --> 03:11.523
[overlapping shouting]

03:11.557 --> 03:14.826
- Come on, now.
That's on you.

03:14.861 --> 03:17.062
- What the hell?
You trying to be funny?

03:17.096 --> 03:18.797
I didn't even have time
to make a move out there.

03:18.831 --> 03:20.332
- I don't understand.
Why aren't you in the end zone?

03:20.366 --> 03:22.401
I got out of your way.
- I will break you up, boy.

03:22.435 --> 03:23.735
Next time
you give me the ball,

03:23.770 --> 03:24.970
You make sure you mean
to give it to me.

03:25.004 --> 03:26.705
[overlapping shouting]

03:26.739 --> 03:28.073
You, you,
you're my problem.

03:28.107 --> 03:29.808
- You're your problem
right now.

03:29.842 --> 03:31.843
- No, you're my problem.
- That's enough.

03:33.000 --> 03:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:26.833 --> 04:28.133
- Yeah.

04:28.167 --> 04:29.401
Deer and beer, here we come,
two days away.

04:29.435 --> 04:30.535
Let's get after it, billy.

04:30.570 --> 04:31.770
- Tim, what the hell
are you doing?

04:31.804 --> 04:33.305
This is how accidents happen.

04:33.339 --> 04:34.773
- Minds, I don't think
they're loaded. We're fine.

04:34.807 --> 04:36.608
- Tim, just put them
in the corner or something.

04:36.642 --> 04:38.543
All right, she's not supposed
to have any stress right now.

04:38.578 --> 04:39.978
- Where's the gun cleaner?

04:40.012 --> 04:43.415
- Why do you have
to clean your guns?

04:43.449 --> 04:45.617
- Wait.

04:47.653 --> 04:49.621
You didn't tell her, did you?

04:49.655 --> 04:50.689
- I totally see now.

04:50.723 --> 04:51.857
So y'all just get to go hunting

04:51.891 --> 04:53.592
And get drunk
and leave me here by myself.

04:53.626 --> 04:54.993
- No.
No, no, no, no, no.

04:55.027 --> 04:56.128
- I have an ultrasound
this week.

04:56.162 --> 04:57.295
- I understand that.

04:57.330 --> 04:59.064
And I want to be there
for that ultrasound.

04:59.098 --> 05:00.665
- So I just get to shove this
fat ass behind a steering wheel

05:00.700 --> 05:02.401
And drive myself to the doctor,
is that what's gonna happen?

05:02.435 --> 05:04.636
- Baby, I will be there
for that ultrasound, okay?

05:04.670 --> 05:06.171
Timmy and I
can go hunting anytime.

05:06.205 --> 05:07.539
- No, we can't.

05:07.573 --> 05:08.974
That's why it's called
hunting season, billy.

05:09.008 --> 05:11.343
- Seriously, I'm gonna put
your head through a wall.

05:11.377 --> 05:13.745
Would you shut up?

05:16.048 --> 05:17.816
[whistle blows]
- let's go.

05:17.850 --> 05:23.488
âª âª

05:23.523 --> 05:25.157
[whistle blows]

05:29.662 --> 05:31.630
Go!
Let's go!

05:31.664 --> 05:32.664
Go!

05:32.698 --> 05:34.800
[players shout]

05:52.485 --> 05:54.186
- All right, jokers.

05:54.220 --> 05:57.489
Who took my wallet?

05:57.523 --> 05:59.958
Seriously, it's not funny.

05:59.992 --> 06:03.962
- You know what I do
when I lose something?

06:03.996 --> 06:06.298
I retrace my steps.

06:06.332 --> 06:08.633
Maybe that's what
you should do, retrace them.

06:08.668 --> 06:09.968
- I didn't lose it.

06:10.002 --> 06:11.636
It was in my locker,
and now it's missing.

06:11.671 --> 06:12.737
- I mean, you want us
to get together?

06:12.772 --> 06:13.772
We could help you
look for it if you want.

06:13.806 --> 06:14.906
- All right, cut the crap.

06:14.941 --> 06:16.208
Seriously, I'm not gonna
tell you again.

06:16.242 --> 06:17.809
Give me my wallet back.

06:17.844 --> 06:20.712
- You're so sure I took it.

06:20.746 --> 06:23.014
- Mm-hmm.

06:25.084 --> 06:27.085
- Go and get it, then.

06:31.123 --> 06:32.757
- Oh, oh.

06:32.792 --> 06:35.427
[overlapping shouting]

06:35.461 --> 06:36.862
- All right, all right,
all right.

06:36.896 --> 06:39.331
- I got a pep rally
to organize this week.

06:39.365 --> 06:41.933
I have got papers to grade.
I've got a family to raise.

06:41.968 --> 06:43.401
I've got a wife to love,

06:43.436 --> 06:45.437
And then I've got
you two bozos,

06:45.471 --> 06:47.339
Trying to teach
you two something

06:47.373 --> 06:49.941
You seem just damned determined
not to learn.

06:51.978 --> 06:53.645
What makes you think
he took your wallet?

06:53.679 --> 06:55.146
- It's obvious, coach.
- It obvious?

06:55.181 --> 06:56.815
You're gonna make a hell
of a lawyer, aren't you?

06:56.849 --> 06:58.517
Do you know where
his wallet is?

06:58.551 --> 06:59.584
- No, sir.

06:59.619 --> 07:00.986
- You don't know
where his wallet is?

07:01.020 --> 07:02.521
- This is a bunch
of bull, coach.

07:02.555 --> 07:04.589
- Hey, coach crowley!

07:04.624 --> 07:06.224
- Yes, sir?

07:06.259 --> 07:08.159
- Coach, would you take
these two gentlemen

07:08.194 --> 07:09.427
To the gymnasium?

07:09.462 --> 07:11.196
Have them run those stairs
for the next 30 minutes

07:11.230 --> 07:12.998
Or until a wallet shows up,

07:13.032 --> 07:14.466
Whichever one might come first.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.201
- You bet.
- Thank you, coach.

07:16.235 --> 07:18.069
Y'all enjoy.
- Let's go, boys.

07:22.808 --> 07:24.943
- [scoffs]

07:24.977 --> 07:31.349
âª âª

07:31.384 --> 07:33.251
- 7.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.086
- Riggs, what's up?

07:35.121 --> 07:37.889
- Slinging dough instead
of 60-yard bombs now, huh?

07:37.924 --> 07:39.624
No chicago?

07:39.659 --> 07:41.426
- Nah, I kind of felt
like I should stay here,

07:41.460 --> 07:42.527
Take care of my grandma.

07:42.562 --> 07:44.129
- Right.

07:44.163 --> 07:45.463
- San antonio?

07:45.498 --> 07:47.232
- Negative.

07:47.266 --> 07:48.934
- What else is new?

07:48.968 --> 07:50.802
- You playing any ball?

07:50.836 --> 07:52.270
- No, not really.

07:52.305 --> 07:54.239
I've been working with this
artist on some art stuff.

07:54.273 --> 07:55.707
Yeah, and then working here,
you know?

07:55.741 --> 07:57.642
- Right.
I forgot about that.

07:57.677 --> 07:59.511
- You, uh, gonna be watching
any football this weekend?

07:59.545 --> 08:02.914
- No, I'm going hunting
this weekend, my friend.

08:02.949 --> 08:04.616
- Oh, yeah?
- Get me some whitetail.

08:04.650 --> 08:06.051
Maybe wrestle down some boars.

08:06.085 --> 08:08.820
- Nice.

08:08.854 --> 08:11.556
- That's my weekend.
- All right.

08:11.591 --> 08:13.024
- Anyways,
it's good to see you.

08:13.059 --> 08:14.826
- You too, buddy.
- Let's go for a beer sometime.

08:14.860 --> 08:19.464
- Yeah, sure.

08:19.498 --> 08:22.567
Hey, riggins, actually, um...

08:22.602 --> 08:26.171
Is it cool if maybe I go
hunting with you this weekend?

08:26.205 --> 08:28.406
- You hunt?

08:28.441 --> 08:30.609
- Well, I mean,
my--my dad took me

08:30.643 --> 08:32.577
A couple times
when I was little.

08:32.611 --> 08:34.946
- Thursday morning...

08:34.981 --> 08:36.780
5:15.
- All right.

08:36.816 --> 08:39.183
- See you there.
- Yeah, man.

08:39.217 --> 08:41.753
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

08:41.787 --> 08:44.556
- It's nasty.
It's nothing but used goods.

08:44.590 --> 08:46.524
Oh, landry, hey.

08:46.559 --> 08:49.027
- Hey. What's going on?
You know devin.

08:49.061 --> 08:50.962
- Hi. Hi.
- Hello.

08:50.997 --> 08:52.564
- How you doing?

08:52.598 --> 08:54.265
- You have a car.

08:54.300 --> 08:55.467
He hit me with it.

08:55.501 --> 08:57.402
- Yeah, I heard about that.

08:57.436 --> 08:58.937
- Yeah, we all know
about it.

08:58.971 --> 09:00.972
- I think you should use
that car

09:01.007 --> 09:02.874
To drop me and my friends off
to this party

09:02.908 --> 09:04.309
In kilroy tomorrow.

09:04.343 --> 09:05.543
Yeah.

09:05.578 --> 09:08.980
- That's an idea, huh?
- Yeah.

09:09.015 --> 09:10.882
- Although I think
I might have to decline,

09:10.916 --> 09:13.318
'cause I've kind of been down
that road before,

09:13.352 --> 09:15.053
Where a girl asked me
to do something,

09:15.087 --> 09:16.721
And I just kind of said yes.

09:16.756 --> 09:18.256
And all of a sudden,
everyone's calling me a word

09:18.290 --> 09:19.691
That I don't like to use.

09:19.725 --> 09:22.293
- You're invited to the party.
You are too.

09:22.328 --> 09:24.663
- Well, you could've just
said that to begin with.

09:24.697 --> 09:26.331
- Thanks for the invitation.

09:26.365 --> 09:27.666
- So you cool?
You want to come?

09:27.700 --> 09:29.334
- Yeah, I think
that sounds great.

09:29.368 --> 09:30.702
- It's gonna be a lot of fun.
- It's gonna be fun.

09:30.736 --> 09:33.171
- All right, see you later.
- Okay, bye.

09:33.205 --> 09:34.572
- Okay.
- All right.

09:34.607 --> 09:37.108
- So you're gonna go
to a party in kilroy.

09:37.143 --> 09:39.077
- Yeah, I am.
What is that?

09:39.111 --> 09:40.545
Why with that tone?

09:40.579 --> 09:42.847
- But I have to tell you
that when I die,

09:42.882 --> 09:44.849
I hope people will say
that she gave

09:44.884 --> 09:46.351
More than she took.

09:46.385 --> 09:48.720
That would be
true success to me.

09:50.523 --> 09:53.324
Mom.
I'm in.

09:53.359 --> 09:54.659
- Oh, my god!

09:54.694 --> 09:57.495
I could not be any prouder
of you, becky.

09:57.530 --> 09:59.297
You make it look so easy,
and it's not.

09:59.331 --> 10:01.733
It is not easy at all.
It is such hard work.

10:01.767 --> 10:02.934
- Thanks, mom.

10:02.968 --> 10:04.369
- You know what?
You need a new gown.

10:04.403 --> 10:05.637
- Yeah?
- Absolutely.

10:05.671 --> 10:07.872
A portrait neckline.

10:07.907 --> 10:10.275
I know, how about tomorrow
before my shift,

10:10.309 --> 10:12.410
We could go find
the perfect dress,

10:12.445 --> 10:14.279
The perfect shoes,
and then get a bite to eat.

10:14.313 --> 10:15.547
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

10:15.581 --> 10:16.948
- Yeah, tomorrow's great.
- Okay.

10:16.982 --> 10:20.485
I can't wait to watch those
other girls eat your dust.

10:20.519 --> 10:21.753
- I got to ask you something,

10:21.787 --> 10:25.256
And I need you
to not be weird about it.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.125
- What's up?

10:30.296 --> 10:32.330
- There's this place
right outside of dillon

10:32.364 --> 10:34.799
Called steers,

10:34.834 --> 10:36.835
And I was wondering
if you'd go there with me.

10:36.869 --> 10:38.269
- Steers?

10:38.304 --> 10:40.338
- It's--

10:40.372 --> 10:41.706
It's gay.

10:41.741 --> 10:45.343
I mean, it's a gay place.

10:47.079 --> 10:49.614
- Are you hitting on me?

10:49.648 --> 10:50.715
- No.

10:50.750 --> 10:52.383
You're not my type.

10:52.418 --> 10:55.754
- Oh, I'm not your type?

10:55.788 --> 10:58.490
- Look, I just need somebody
to go there with me.

10:58.524 --> 11:01.626
This is a new experience,
and it's kind of weird.

11:01.660 --> 11:05.563
And it'd be nice
to have a friend go with me.

11:05.598 --> 11:07.599
- I'll go.

11:07.633 --> 11:10.502
See what your type is like.

11:10.536 --> 11:11.936
[engine turning]

11:11.971 --> 11:13.872
- Well, I think
where we need to focus

11:13.906 --> 11:17.642
All our attention right now
is library, library, library.

11:17.676 --> 11:20.945
It's been since 2005
since we've had any updates.

11:20.980 --> 11:22.947
It'z where we should focus
our funds.

11:22.982 --> 11:25.150
- Yeah, but, um, you know,
I'm--I'm really sorry.

11:25.184 --> 11:27.318
Our budget is already
tapped out.

11:27.353 --> 11:28.620
Maybe we can do this
next year.

11:28.654 --> 11:29.954
- But, no, I mean, you know,

11:29.989 --> 11:31.422
We had actually pushed it
last year,

11:31.457 --> 11:32.891
And we had talked about
that this--

11:32.925 --> 11:34.759
This would be where
our focus was this year.

11:34.794 --> 11:35.960
- Look, there are
a lot of people

11:35.995 --> 11:37.262
Who are pretty angry
out there, tami.

11:37.296 --> 11:40.765
I mean, you realize
that a substantial portion

11:40.800 --> 11:42.867
Of the school's revenue
is generated by football,

11:42.902 --> 11:45.136
Don't you?

11:45.171 --> 11:46.971
- Oh, so you mean
people are angry

11:47.006 --> 11:49.374
Because I told luke cafferty
that he had to go

11:49.408 --> 11:51.843
To the correct school
for his district?

11:51.877 --> 11:53.578
That's why we're not gonna get
our library?

11:53.612 --> 11:55.079
That seems like
a shame to me.

11:55.114 --> 11:56.447
- Look, after what you did
with luke,

11:56.482 --> 11:57.615
We're gonna be lucky

11:57.650 --> 11:59.250
To reach half
the normal amount this year.

11:59.285 --> 12:01.686
I mean, you cost yourself
and the school

12:01.720 --> 12:05.056
Any chance we might have had
to improve that library.

12:05.090 --> 12:06.724
Now, I'm sorry, tami,
if you'll excuse me,

12:06.759 --> 12:08.359
I do have another meeting.

12:14.934 --> 12:16.935
- [gasps]

12:19.205 --> 12:21.206
What?

12:32.455 --> 12:34.589
- Hello, mr. Rc collins,
class of '79?

12:34.623 --> 12:38.660
Mr. Collins, I would like
to talk to you about football.

12:38.694 --> 12:39.994
I would like to talk to you

12:40.029 --> 12:41.663
About east dillon
high school football

12:41.697 --> 12:43.598
And coach eric taylor.

12:43.632 --> 12:45.600
Hello?

12:48.037 --> 12:49.237
- Try the next one.

12:49.271 --> 12:51.373
- How's it going?
- Good.

12:51.407 --> 12:54.142
- What are you doing exactly?

12:54.176 --> 12:57.479
- We're looking up alumni from
the east dillon lions of past

12:57.513 --> 12:59.614
To try to get them
to join the pep rally.

12:59.648 --> 13:01.516
- Yeah, your husband
had the inspired idea

13:01.550 --> 13:03.885
To make the pep rally
a sort of a homecoming.

13:03.919 --> 13:05.754
- That is inspired.

13:05.788 --> 13:07.889
- The lions of east dillon
are not roaring.

13:07.923 --> 13:10.125
- He's not home.
- Try the nine, three--

13:10.159 --> 13:12.293
- Honey, honey, come here.

13:12.328 --> 13:14.195
Come here.

13:14.230 --> 13:16.464
- Hello, is this
mr. Eddie boare,

13:16.499 --> 13:17.866
Class of '79?

13:17.900 --> 13:20.201
- Honey, you need food.
- Huh?

13:20.236 --> 13:22.003
- You need food
for these people.

13:22.037 --> 13:24.406
If you want to bring people in,
you got to make them some food,

13:24.440 --> 13:27.108
Just like we do,
just like we've always done.

13:27.143 --> 13:29.978
- You offering to cook dinner?

13:30.012 --> 13:33.314
- Oh, lordy.
Well, perhaps I am.

13:33.349 --> 13:35.750
Perhaps I am offering
to cook dinner, babe, yeah.

13:35.785 --> 13:38.453
Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

13:38.487 --> 13:41.523
- Mm-hmm.

13:41.557 --> 13:42.857
You're welcome.

13:42.892 --> 13:45.794
- That's real sweet.

13:45.828 --> 13:48.096
- Thanks.
- Okay.

13:48.130 --> 13:50.565
All right, well, I'm gonna
get myself ready for school.

13:50.599 --> 13:52.400
Y'all, good luck.
- Hi.

13:52.435 --> 13:54.135
- I'm stan traub,

13:54.170 --> 13:55.937
Assistant coach.

13:55.971 --> 13:57.439
- Julie, daughter.

13:57.473 --> 13:58.973
[chuckles]
nice to meet you.

13:59.008 --> 14:00.842
- Hey, mom.

14:03.412 --> 14:06.481
Mom, are you ready to go?

14:19.495 --> 14:22.230
- What?

14:22.264 --> 14:24.098
- Can I borrow your truck?

14:24.133 --> 14:25.533
- No.
- Please.

14:25.568 --> 14:27.669
- You can't borr--you don't even
have your license.

14:27.703 --> 14:31.105
- I know how to drive.
- I don't care.

14:33.209 --> 14:35.410
- Thanks.

14:38.814 --> 14:40.582
- What's wrong?

14:43.118 --> 14:45.186
- My mom blew me off...

14:45.221 --> 14:46.554
Again.

14:48.824 --> 14:51.259
- There is a gay bar
in dillon?

14:51.293 --> 14:53.795
- It's not in dillon.
It's outside of dillon.

14:53.829 --> 14:55.096
- It's the same difference.

14:55.130 --> 14:57.765
- Mr. Matthew,
"za" is not a word.

14:57.800 --> 14:59.334
- "za" is a word.

14:59.368 --> 15:01.302
And if you look at it,
it spells "za,"

15:01.337 --> 15:03.104
As in "pizza."

15:03.138 --> 15:05.206
It's vernacular
in certain places, but wait--

15:05.241 --> 15:06.441
- You are such a liar.

15:06.475 --> 15:08.176
- Don't try and distract me
from the fact

15:08.210 --> 15:09.511
That you're going
to a gay bar.

15:09.545 --> 15:11.212
What are you gonna do
at--at a gay bar?

15:11.247 --> 15:14.582
- Dance and make out
with some chicks.

15:14.617 --> 15:15.917
- I-I knew it.

15:15.951 --> 15:17.752
I knew you wanted
to experiment.

15:17.786 --> 15:20.388
- No, I'm going for devin
to be her moral support.

15:20.422 --> 15:21.689
- Whatever,
I don't even care.

15:21.724 --> 15:23.591
I'm going hunting
with riggins anyway.

15:23.626 --> 15:24.692
- That's a joke.

15:24.727 --> 15:26.394
You're going hunting
with riggins?

15:26.428 --> 15:27.929
- It's not a joke.

15:27.963 --> 15:29.697
- So you're just gonna go shoot
some poor defenseless animals

15:29.732 --> 15:30.732
For the hell of it?

15:30.766 --> 15:33.134
- Uh...

15:33.168 --> 15:34.302
Yeah, well, to eat.

15:34.336 --> 15:35.370
- You are so much better
than that.

15:35.404 --> 15:36.638
Why would you stoop
to that level?

15:36.672 --> 15:38.306
- No, I'm not.
I'm not better than that.

15:38.340 --> 15:39.541
- It's disgusting.
- Whoa, hold on.

15:39.575 --> 15:41.442
Hold the phone.
I live in dillon.

15:41.477 --> 15:42.977
And people in dillon,
what they do

15:43.012 --> 15:44.512
Is they go hunting
and shoot animals.

15:44.547 --> 15:45.780
That's just
the way it works.

15:45.814 --> 15:47.148
- That is an awful excuse,
first of all.

15:47.182 --> 15:48.149
And second of all,
I live in dillon.

15:48.183 --> 15:49.250
I don't go hunting.

15:49.285 --> 15:51.686
- You don't live
in dillon for long.

15:51.720 --> 15:53.788
I need a word...

15:53.822 --> 15:55.390
Word.

15:55.424 --> 15:57.792
- Is this about
my college applications?

16:00.129 --> 16:02.363
- No, it's not about
your college applications.

16:02.398 --> 16:03.798
It's not even about you.

16:03.832 --> 16:06.434
I don't know why you think
everything's about you.

16:09.371 --> 16:11.439
- No.

16:11.473 --> 16:15.243
No.

16:15.277 --> 16:17.011
All of this says runner-up.

16:17.046 --> 16:20.949
None of this is good.

16:20.983 --> 16:23.117
- I'm sure your mom
wanted to be here for this.

16:23.152 --> 16:24.819
- Yeah, or she hooked up
with some dude.

16:24.853 --> 16:25.987
You know, whatever.

16:26.021 --> 16:27.221
- Hey, look, cut her some slack.
I'm sure--

16:27.256 --> 16:28.823
- Don't.

16:28.857 --> 16:30.658
[voice breaking]
okay, because every time

16:30.693 --> 16:32.627
Something really important
comes along,

16:32.661 --> 16:34.662
Every time, she does this.

16:34.697 --> 16:37.498
She has an emergency
or a date,

16:37.533 --> 16:39.434
Or she takes another shift
at that stupid bar.

16:39.468 --> 16:41.135
- Hey, look,
this one's nice.

16:41.170 --> 16:43.871
It's pretty.

16:43.906 --> 16:45.840
- You think it's pretty?

16:45.874 --> 16:48.409
- Yeah.

16:48.444 --> 16:51.813
- Is that a portrait neckline?

16:51.847 --> 16:53.281
- Yeah.

16:53.315 --> 16:55.083
- This is stupid.
You don't even know.

16:55.117 --> 16:56.517
Can we go, please?

16:56.552 --> 16:58.386
- No, wait, we can't go.

16:58.420 --> 17:01.189
We're here.
We got to pick something.

17:01.223 --> 17:02.790
And what's that saying?

17:02.825 --> 17:05.693
Doesn't the dress find you?

17:05.728 --> 17:09.497
- Can we please just go?
This was such a dumb idea.

17:14.970 --> 17:17.171
- [sighs]

17:17.205 --> 17:19.040
I'm gonna tell you something,
all right?

17:19.074 --> 17:22.042
And you can't tell it
to anyone else.

17:25.781 --> 17:30.551
Well, my mother never took me
shopping for a pageant gown.

17:30.586 --> 17:33.721
And because of that...

17:33.756 --> 17:35.790
I never placed at miss texas.

17:37.960 --> 17:41.562
That's why
I got into football.

17:41.597 --> 17:43.598
That's a fact.

17:46.735 --> 17:49.303
This is what
we're gonna do.

17:49.338 --> 17:52.607
We're gonna start
with the wheels,

17:52.641 --> 17:55.176
And then we'll work
our way up.

17:55.210 --> 17:57.378
By then,
hopefully they'll have

17:57.413 --> 17:59.814
A new shipment
of dresses in.

17:59.848 --> 18:01.015
âª âª

18:01.050 --> 18:03.518
- Hey, landry.

18:03.552 --> 18:05.687
Y'all, look at his shirt.

18:05.721 --> 18:07.689
- Oh, my god.
What does he have on?

18:07.723 --> 18:09.190
- How's it going?

18:09.224 --> 18:11.626
You all ready for some
good old-fashioned revelry?

18:11.660 --> 18:14.128
- What's this music?

18:14.163 --> 18:16.397
- Oh, I'm glad you like it.
This is actually--

18:16.432 --> 18:18.566
It's this local band.
Their name is crucifictorious.

18:18.600 --> 18:20.134
- Do we have to listen
to this the whole ride?

18:20.169 --> 18:22.136
I'm just saying.

18:22.171 --> 18:23.304
- You look nice.

18:23.338 --> 18:24.972
- Oh, thanks.
What's this music?

18:25.007 --> 18:26.407
- Here, hold on,
just give it a--

18:26.442 --> 18:28.543
âª âª

18:28.577 --> 18:30.011
- Feel his hair.

18:30.045 --> 18:31.713
It's like grass.

18:31.747 --> 18:33.848
[laughter]

18:35.050 --> 18:36.584
[indistinct chatter]

18:43.726 --> 18:45.793
- Jess, you are looking
really good tonight.

18:45.828 --> 18:48.796
I'm surprised
to see you here.

18:48.831 --> 18:51.365
- Really?

18:51.400 --> 18:54.102
- What's up with you?
What's your problem?

18:54.136 --> 18:56.704
- I ain't got
no problem with you.

18:56.739 --> 18:59.140
I think I'm the only person
who sees how disposable

18:59.174 --> 19:01.209
You treat girls.

19:01.243 --> 19:03.077
- Well, I can only
treat a girl

19:03.112 --> 19:06.013
How she allows me
to treat her.

19:06.048 --> 19:07.915
Maybe I been talking
to the wrong girls.

19:07.950 --> 19:09.917
- See, now you're trying
to piss me off.

19:09.952 --> 19:12.854
- You're sitting here frontin'
like you don't--

19:12.888 --> 19:14.555
You don't think about me.

19:14.590 --> 19:17.258
Not even a little bit?

19:19.194 --> 19:23.431
- You wish I thought
about you.

19:23.465 --> 19:26.434
I have a boyfriend.
- You got a boyfriend?

19:26.468 --> 19:32.173
âª âª

19:32.207 --> 19:33.608
- What's up with that, man?

19:33.642 --> 19:35.510
I know that ain't
that opie-looking dude

19:35.544 --> 19:37.812
I hit in football practice,
is it?

19:37.846 --> 19:39.280
- I guess so.

19:39.314 --> 19:42.049
- Looks like jess
hitting it now.

19:48.390 --> 19:50.992
- Ah.

19:51.026 --> 19:53.227
It's over.

19:53.262 --> 19:55.730
I'm not a panther anymore.

19:55.764 --> 19:58.032
And it makes me--

19:58.066 --> 20:00.568
I feel ill.

20:00.602 --> 20:02.904
But I don't know why
I'm saying this to you.

20:02.938 --> 20:04.705
You know what it's like
to be a panther

20:04.740 --> 20:07.975
And have it
taken away from you.

20:08.010 --> 20:10.278
I'm sorry about it.

20:12.614 --> 20:15.183
I'm sorry
about all of it, eric.

20:20.489 --> 20:22.356
- Tami and I are having

20:22.391 --> 20:24.125
Some east dillon alumni over

20:24.159 --> 20:27.328
This week for dinner.

20:27.362 --> 20:30.097
Why don't you
come over and join us?

20:33.836 --> 20:38.072
- You can't fake
"boosterism," eric.

20:38.106 --> 20:40.241
It comes from the heart.

20:42.544 --> 20:44.478
That's the beauty of it.

20:49.351 --> 20:50.518
- Hey, what's up, landry?

20:50.552 --> 20:52.286
I was surprised to see youat .

20:52.321 --> 20:53.788
You have fun?
- That was fun.

20:53.822 --> 20:54.956
That was a lot of fun.

20:54.990 --> 20:57.124
Someone spilled something
on my shoes,

20:57.159 --> 20:58.926
But other than that,
it was fun.

20:58.961 --> 21:00.394
- You had a good time.
You was dancing and stuff.

21:00.429 --> 21:01.562
- Yeah, I had a good time.

21:01.597 --> 21:03.097
- Yeah, you had
a good time with jess?

21:03.131 --> 21:04.398
- Yeah.

21:04.433 --> 21:08.703
I mean, you know, just as...

21:08.737 --> 21:10.137
I was just her ride.

21:10.172 --> 21:13.374
- Really? 'cause she told me
you were her boyfriend.

21:13.408 --> 21:15.710
- Is--no.

21:15.744 --> 21:17.912
I'm definitely
not her boyfriend.

21:17.946 --> 21:19.113
She said that?

21:19.147 --> 21:20.882
- Yeah, she did.

21:20.916 --> 21:23.384
- No.
That's crazy.

21:23.418 --> 21:26.888
- You're not lying to me,
are you?

21:26.922 --> 21:29.257
- No, I'm not.

21:30.926 --> 21:34.629
That's news to me.
[chuckles]

21:34.663 --> 21:36.264
- All right.

21:36.298 --> 21:37.932
You good.

21:37.966 --> 21:39.600
Be safe.

21:39.635 --> 21:41.435
- Okay.

21:43.505 --> 21:44.906
- Hey, how you doing?
- Hey.

21:44.940 --> 21:47.808
- Uh...
- What'll it be?

21:47.843 --> 21:50.077
- You're not by chance
virgil merriweather?

21:50.112 --> 21:53.180
1983 state championship,
quarterback,

21:53.215 --> 21:54.649
East dillon lions?

21:54.683 --> 21:56.584
- What'll it be?

21:56.618 --> 21:58.819
- Well, I'll have

21:58.854 --> 22:01.122
A, uh, pound of brisket,
if you would, please.

22:01.156 --> 22:02.356
I'm eric taylor.

22:02.391 --> 22:03.958
I'm the new coach
over at east dillon.

22:03.992 --> 22:06.260
- $8.50.

22:08.130 --> 22:09.730
- You don't by chance
rent this place out

22:09.765 --> 22:10.932
For events or anything,
do you?

22:10.966 --> 22:12.667
- Nope.

22:12.701 --> 22:14.001
- Well, that's too bad.

22:14.036 --> 22:16.837
We got our first pep rally,
homecoming coming up.

22:16.872 --> 22:19.640
- That's nice.

22:19.675 --> 22:21.909
- Look, this may sound odd,
but my wife and I

22:21.944 --> 22:24.211
Are having a dinner party
for some ex-lion players.

22:24.246 --> 22:25.980
- Nope.

22:26.014 --> 22:29.483
- I got some really great
kids on my team.

22:29.518 --> 22:30.685
They're good kids,

22:30.719 --> 22:32.520
And they could sure
use someone like you

22:32.554 --> 22:34.522
To come over and speak
some words to them.

22:34.556 --> 22:37.124
- Brisket will be out
in a few.

22:43.031 --> 22:44.799
- Hey, luke,
let me get this straight, man.

22:44.833 --> 22:46.300
This guy steals your wallet,

22:46.335 --> 22:47.735
And you don't do anything
about it?

22:47.769 --> 22:49.570
- What do you want me to do?
- Get your wallet back.

22:49.604 --> 22:51.072
- Look, luke,

22:51.106 --> 22:53.808
I know east dillon's
like a prison or whatever,

22:53.842 --> 22:55.409
But I didn't think
you'd become someone's bitch.

22:55.444 --> 22:56.577
[laughter]

22:56.611 --> 22:58.679
- Hey, I know, right?

23:00.716 --> 23:02.683
- Stop the car.

23:02.718 --> 23:04.051
- What?
- Stop the car.

23:08.924 --> 23:10.791
- I see you brought
your boyfriends with you

23:10.826 --> 23:12.059
To help you look
for your wallet.

23:12.094 --> 23:13.995
- Why don't you shut up
and give it back?

23:14.029 --> 23:16.731
- You don't know
when to quit, do you?

23:16.765 --> 23:18.499
- Oh!

23:21.103 --> 23:22.403
- There you go, luke.
Take him down.

23:22.437 --> 23:24.238
- Don't know when to quit!

23:24.272 --> 23:25.473
[siren wails]

23:25.507 --> 23:27.475
- Come on.
Let's go.

23:27.509 --> 23:28.609
[siren wailing]

23:28.643 --> 23:30.811
- Go, go.
- Come on, man, let's go.

23:30.846 --> 23:32.013
- Forget him. Let's go.

23:35.617 --> 23:37.785
- Break it up, boys.
Break it up.

23:46.362 --> 23:47.662
- Hey, deacon,
how long have you

23:47.696 --> 23:48.997
Been over there
at bethel baptist?

23:49.031 --> 23:50.665
- 18 years.

23:50.699 --> 23:53.568
- That's a long time.

23:53.602 --> 23:56.004
- Coach taylor,
can I ask you something?

23:56.038 --> 23:57.071
- Yes, sir.

23:57.106 --> 23:58.540
- Why are we here?

23:58.574 --> 24:00.608
- Oh, lord have mercy, deacon.

24:00.643 --> 24:03.411
I'm trying to enjoy
my meal here.

24:03.445 --> 24:05.680
Man.

24:05.714 --> 24:09.050
- No, that's, uh--
that's a good question.

24:10.986 --> 24:12.787
Listen...

24:12.821 --> 24:15.256
I just started coaching
at this school.

24:15.291 --> 24:17.225
I would imagine that you
would think of it

24:17.259 --> 24:18.726
As your high school too.

24:18.761 --> 24:20.562
With that said,

24:20.596 --> 24:24.666
We are facing--

24:24.700 --> 24:26.935
I am facing a lot
of challenges over there.

24:26.969 --> 24:28.736
And we've got some problems
that I want--

24:28.771 --> 24:30.038
- With all due respect,

24:30.072 --> 24:31.806
People from your part of town

24:31.840 --> 24:34.609
Pretty frequently tell us
about our problems,

24:34.643 --> 24:36.444
Our crime problems,
our education problems.

24:36.478 --> 24:38.580
You know how we got
these problems?

24:38.614 --> 24:40.748
Back in the '80s, the west side
of dillon got developed.

24:40.783 --> 24:43.284
They got the mall.
They got the hotel.

24:43.319 --> 24:44.986
The west side of dillon
got the money.

24:45.020 --> 24:46.788
- What did we get?
- We got forgotten.

24:46.822 --> 24:48.323
- We got
our high school closed.

24:48.357 --> 24:50.191
- And so listen, we thank you
for your hospitality,

24:50.225 --> 24:52.260
But I think I'm gonna
skip that lecture

24:52.294 --> 24:54.996
About our problems.

24:55.030 --> 24:58.166
- Well, I know nobody
needs a lecture here,

24:58.200 --> 24:59.467
That's for sure.

24:59.501 --> 25:01.502
- That's right.
- I think the truth is,

25:01.537 --> 25:03.504
We just--we just wanted
to get to know y'all

25:03.539 --> 25:05.640
A little bit better,
and I was just hoping

25:05.674 --> 25:08.109
Y'all would get to know
my husband a little bit better,

25:08.143 --> 25:09.477
Because if there's
one thing about this man,

25:09.511 --> 25:10.812
He loves football.

25:10.846 --> 25:12.847
He loves football.
He loves those boys out there.

25:12.881 --> 25:14.015
Lives and breathes it.

25:14.049 --> 25:15.450
You know,
it's family to us.

25:15.484 --> 25:17.452
- Fact of the matter is
it's pretty damn hard

25:17.486 --> 25:19.420
Playing football when you've
got nobody out there

25:19.455 --> 25:22.590
Appreciating the effort
that you're putting into it.

25:22.625 --> 25:25.760
- You like losing
with everybody watching?

25:25.794 --> 25:27.562
- Well, deacon, that's what
we're trying to fix.

25:27.596 --> 25:29.631
[doorbell chimes]
we're trying to fix that.

25:29.665 --> 25:31.099
- Hmm.

25:31.133 --> 25:32.834
- Hello.
- Oh, hey, buddy.

25:32.868 --> 25:35.269
How are you?
- How are you?

25:35.304 --> 25:36.638
- Is that buddy garrity?

25:36.672 --> 25:38.006
- You know buddy?

25:38.040 --> 25:40.274
- Do I know buddy?
[chuckles]

25:40.309 --> 25:41.943
- Y'all,
this is buddy garrity.

25:41.977 --> 25:44.379
- Buddy garrity.
[laughter]

25:44.413 --> 25:47.415
- Mo hall,
you got to be kidding.

25:47.449 --> 25:49.017
Big mo lost some weight.

25:49.051 --> 25:51.285
- Nobody never hit harder
than buddy garrity,

25:51.320 --> 25:52.620
I'll tell you.

25:52.655 --> 25:54.055
- Hey, buddy.

25:54.089 --> 25:56.024
- Damon gaston,
good to see you,

25:56.058 --> 25:57.558
Good to see you.
- Honey, buddy's here.

25:57.593 --> 25:58.559
- Buddy's here.

25:58.594 --> 26:00.061
- Hey.
- Hello, coach.

26:00.095 --> 26:02.296
- Hey, buddy, how are you?
It's good to see you.

26:02.331 --> 26:03.564
- Good to see you.
Good to see you.

26:03.599 --> 26:04.565
Hello, deacon.

26:04.600 --> 26:10.405
âª âª

26:10.439 --> 26:12.674
- So is this what you
expected it to be like?

26:12.708 --> 26:14.676
- Not exactly.

26:14.710 --> 26:18.880
But I really like
the lighting in here.

26:18.914 --> 26:20.915
- [chuckles]

26:23.519 --> 26:26.988
- I just don't know
how anybody meets anybody.

26:27.022 --> 26:30.725
- You are asking
the wrong person.

26:30.759 --> 26:34.996
- But you've--you've got
the forever boyfriend, though.

26:35.030 --> 26:36.631
- Yeah, well,

26:36.665 --> 26:39.033
Forever boyfriend is...

26:39.068 --> 26:40.401
I don't know.

26:40.436 --> 26:42.036
It's like he seems
pissed off

26:42.071 --> 26:43.705
About, like,
the stupidest things,

26:43.739 --> 26:45.339
And then we get
in these ridiculous arguments

26:45.374 --> 26:47.909
That go absolutely nowhere,
and it's like--

26:47.943 --> 26:50.344
It's like I don't know
how to fix us.

26:50.379 --> 26:53.948
It's like something that's
broken or--I don't know.

26:53.982 --> 26:55.783
You're not even
paying attention.

26:55.818 --> 26:57.185
What are you looking at?

26:57.219 --> 26:59.287
- Don't look over there.

26:59.321 --> 27:01.923
- Is that your type?

27:01.957 --> 27:05.626
She's cute.
- I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

27:05.661 --> 27:07.328
Don't flirt
while I'm gone, okay?

27:07.362 --> 27:11.232
- You know me.

27:11.266 --> 27:13.367
- Almost what?

27:13.402 --> 27:16.938
[laughs]

27:29.485 --> 27:32.086
- I was gonna help you
with those dishes,

27:32.121 --> 27:33.921
But I somehow got stuck
to the couch.

27:33.956 --> 27:35.523
- Mm-hmm,
so it seems.

27:35.557 --> 27:38.326
Thank you so much.
I think I got it.

27:38.360 --> 27:40.027
- I almost made it
back in there.

27:40.062 --> 27:42.663
I just got
a little tired here.

27:42.698 --> 27:44.132
- Mmm.

27:44.166 --> 27:46.367
I heard deacon malone
say that he was gonna

27:46.401 --> 27:47.869
Make some calls for you.

27:47.903 --> 27:50.138
- That's because you make
a damn good steak,

27:50.172 --> 27:52.240
Is what it is.

27:54.376 --> 27:57.445
Hey.
- Hmm?

27:57.479 --> 28:00.548
- Thanks for tonight.

28:00.582 --> 28:02.984
- Don't thank me.
Thank buddy garrity.

28:03.018 --> 28:04.786
- Buddy garrity
ate all my damn steak.

28:04.820 --> 28:07.421
- [chuckles]
he sure did.

28:10.359 --> 28:12.326
- Hey, you know what?
- Hmm?

28:12.361 --> 28:14.929
- You're good at what you do.

28:14.963 --> 28:16.464
You wear a lot of hats.

28:16.498 --> 28:17.932
- Thank you.

28:24.106 --> 28:26.374
[phone rings]

28:26.408 --> 28:27.708
- Oh.

28:27.743 --> 28:29.510
- Goodness gracious.

28:29.545 --> 28:33.214
[ringing continues]

28:33.248 --> 28:34.816
- It's not buddy.

28:34.850 --> 28:38.186
Hello?

28:38.220 --> 28:39.453
Yes, sir.

28:42.057 --> 28:44.125
- The white kid,
he's got no record.

28:44.159 --> 28:45.526
He can go.

28:45.561 --> 28:47.795
The black kid,
he's going to juvie.

28:47.830 --> 28:50.131
- His name is vince.

28:50.165 --> 28:51.799
Has he made mistakes?

28:51.834 --> 28:53.501
Hell, yeah,
the kid's made mistakes.

28:53.535 --> 28:54.836
You know what, though?
He shows up.

28:54.870 --> 28:56.504
He gets the job done.
He works hard.

28:56.538 --> 28:57.705
I vouch for him.

28:57.739 --> 28:59.373
All I'm asking, you give him
a second chance.

28:59.408 --> 29:02.543
- Coach, he's used up
his chances.

29:02.578 --> 29:03.644
- Can I see them?

29:03.679 --> 29:05.046
Thank you.

29:05.080 --> 29:06.814
- Coach, I can explain.
I didn't--

29:06.849 --> 29:08.983
- Shh.

29:09.017 --> 29:13.521
Just listen.

29:13.555 --> 29:16.490
We are at a crossroads
right now.

29:18.727 --> 29:22.230
You are gonna admit
that everything was your fault.

29:22.264 --> 29:23.731
- My dad--
- quiet.

29:23.765 --> 29:27.368
You are gonna cut
the tough-guy crap.

29:27.402 --> 29:29.503
You are both gonna say

29:29.538 --> 29:32.106
Exactly what
I tell you to say,

29:32.140 --> 29:34.609
And we are gonna fix this.

29:34.643 --> 29:36.677
Understood?

29:36.712 --> 29:38.045
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

29:57.633 --> 30:00.835
- You get one chance
in life, fellas.

30:05.307 --> 30:08.476
You can either
take advantage of it,

30:08.510 --> 30:12.213
Or you can piss it away.

30:12.247 --> 30:14.982
You do the latter,

30:15.017 --> 30:18.119
And you're gonna regret it
the rest of your lives.

30:21.757 --> 30:23.090
Get out.

30:23.125 --> 30:25.159
[locks open]

30:25.193 --> 30:27.228
Get out of the car.

30:35.137 --> 30:36.570
- He really took off.

30:36.605 --> 30:39.173
He really did.

30:42.778 --> 30:45.680
- Hey, howard,
it's this way.

30:45.714 --> 30:47.715
- You sure?

30:53.488 --> 30:55.489
Thanks.

31:02.965 --> 31:04.966
- [scoffs]

31:12.841 --> 31:14.375
- Go, go, go, go.
Go. Go.

31:14.409 --> 31:16.043
Caleb, go ahead!
Beat him!

31:16.078 --> 31:18.379
[chuckles]

31:20.816 --> 31:23.417
Wait, y'all slow--
okay, be careful.

31:25.988 --> 31:27.254
- Lunches.

31:27.289 --> 31:28.622
Line up, line up, line up.

31:28.657 --> 31:29.857
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

31:29.891 --> 31:32.460
Pop! Pop! Pop!

31:32.494 --> 31:33.794
Hey, hey, come on,
get over here, boy.

31:33.829 --> 31:35.663
Come on over here.
Give me some.

31:35.697 --> 31:36.831
Ahh!
Go get on the bus.

31:36.865 --> 31:38.332
Hurry up, catch 'em.
Catch 'em, now.

31:38.367 --> 31:39.734
- Go get 'em!

31:39.768 --> 31:41.769
Daddy, they got pop warner
practice after school today.

31:41.803 --> 31:43.104
- Okay, you take your brothers,
and I'll make sure

31:43.138 --> 31:45.439
They get a ride
from mrs. Turner, all right?

31:45.474 --> 31:47.308
- Okay, you think maybe you can
stop by just for a second?

31:47.342 --> 31:49.176
- Look, go on before
you miss the bus.

31:50.912 --> 31:53.080
- Dada, I heard
what coach taylor

31:53.115 --> 31:55.883
Was talking to you about
the other day.

31:55.917 --> 31:57.618
- That ain't
your business, jess.

31:57.652 --> 32:00.888
- Daddy, oka
look, I'm sorry.

32:00.922 --> 32:02.790
I-I like football, okay?

32:02.824 --> 32:04.091
Andre loves football.

32:04.126 --> 32:05.926
Darius loves it so much,
he throws up

32:05.961 --> 32:08.529
Because he gets so nervous
before each game.

32:08.563 --> 32:09.764
But it's fine,
it really is.

32:09.798 --> 32:11.198
It's not your thing anymore.

32:11.233 --> 32:14.001
But it's still in us.

32:14.036 --> 32:16.170
We're still
a football family.

32:16.204 --> 32:17.605
- Jess, it ain't
for you to decide.

32:17.639 --> 32:19.573
- Daddy, I'm not trying
to decide anything.

32:19.608 --> 32:23.477
I'm just asking if we could
hold a pep rally here.

32:23.512 --> 32:26.013
It'd be fun, dad.

32:28.016 --> 32:30.051
- Get on before
you miss the bus.

32:31.787 --> 32:33.921
Go ahead,
take the boys to school.

32:33.955 --> 32:35.289
- Yes, sir.

32:39.761 --> 32:42.196
- I'm hoping we get something
over that fire tonight.

32:42.230 --> 32:44.832
So keep the eyes peeled,
light feet.

32:44.866 --> 32:47.234
- What kind of things you think
we gonna--we gonna get?

32:47.269 --> 32:50.171
- Whitetail, boar.

32:52.941 --> 32:55.643
[gunshot]

32:55.677 --> 32:56.777
- 7, stop!
- What?

32:56.812 --> 32:59.213
- What was it?
- Well, I--

32:59.247 --> 33:02.817
I don't--I don't--
I don't know.

33:02.851 --> 33:04.852
- What do you mean
you don't know?

33:04.886 --> 33:06.053
The wind?

33:06.088 --> 33:07.421
- Well, I thought
I saw something,

33:07.456 --> 33:09.023
But I think it might have
been the wind.

33:09.057 --> 33:10.891
- So you're shooting--
give me that.

33:10.926 --> 33:12.359
- Hey!
- No gun.

33:12.394 --> 33:14.428
No gun.

33:16.898 --> 33:19.567
- Really? Come on,
let me have my gun back.

33:19.601 --> 33:23.537
- The number's 555-0101.

33:23.572 --> 33:26.440
- Sammy, this year the panthers
were destined for greatness.

33:26.475 --> 33:28.342
But now we got
to run the table

33:28.376 --> 33:30.144
Just to make it
to the playoffs.

33:30.178 --> 33:32.513
You ask me, tami taylor
should send a resignation

33:32.547 --> 33:35.449
And a written apology.

33:35.484 --> 33:43.457
âª âª

33:43.492 --> 33:45.493
- Come on, y'all.

33:48.797 --> 33:51.599
I just did what was right!
I did what I had to do!

33:51.633 --> 33:54.502
I'm sorry I messed up
football for everybody!

33:54.536 --> 34:02.910
âª âª

34:02.944 --> 34:05.112
Hey.

34:05.147 --> 34:07.081
I need some chocolate, please.

34:09.951 --> 34:12.186
So am I your boyfriend?

34:12.219 --> 34:14.655
'cause it--it really seemed
like vince thought

34:14.688 --> 34:16.190
That I was your boyfriend.

34:16.224 --> 34:18.025
He said that
that's what you said.

34:18.059 --> 34:19.927
- I didn't say that
to him at all.

34:19.960 --> 34:22.096
I just said
I had a boyfriend.

34:22.130 --> 34:23.563
- Oh, okay.

34:23.598 --> 34:25.199
Just wanted to clear that up.

34:25.233 --> 34:26.233
- But it's not like
we're dating,

34:26.268 --> 34:27.902
So what does it really matter?

34:27.936 --> 34:29.837
We're not.
- Okay, 100% not.

34:29.871 --> 34:30.838
Both: All right.

34:30.871 --> 34:32.438
- See you later.

34:35.143 --> 34:38.045
- College.

34:38.079 --> 34:41.248
I'll tell you
what college was like.

34:41.283 --> 34:44.918
7:00 a.M. Mandatory wake-up.

34:44.953 --> 34:48.255
Then these fantastic
one-on-ones

34:48.290 --> 34:50.090
With this robotic coach
that tells you

34:50.125 --> 34:52.092
What you're doing wrong
every single day--

34:52.127 --> 34:53.393
Nothing like coach taylor.

34:53.428 --> 34:55.728
We were spoiled.

34:55.764 --> 34:57.164
Plus, college is boring,

34:57.199 --> 34:59.833
And you get a curfew
every night.

35:03.038 --> 35:05.039
- You miss lyla, though?

35:08.476 --> 35:12.379
- I think we had
different paths.

35:12.414 --> 35:13.514
- So does that mean yes?

35:13.548 --> 35:14.748
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

35:14.783 --> 35:15.749
- Yeah.

35:15.784 --> 35:17.851
How about you?
How's dillon?

35:17.886 --> 35:19.420
- It's okay.

35:19.454 --> 35:23.290
Not as bad
as I thought it'd be.

35:23.325 --> 35:25.292
I mean, I'm getting to spend
a lot of time with my grandma,

35:25.327 --> 35:26.794
So that's good.

35:26.828 --> 35:28.996
And I don't know, I make a lot
more money delivering pizzas

35:29.030 --> 35:31.031
With tips and stuff
than I used to make

35:31.066 --> 35:32.900
Over at the alamo freeze.

35:35.003 --> 35:38.005
- So basically you stayed
in dillon 'cause of jules.

35:40.508 --> 35:41.775
- Yeah.

35:41.810 --> 35:45.045
- Yeah.

35:45.080 --> 35:47.748
- Now she's--she's applying
to colleges and stuff, right?

35:47.782 --> 35:49.116
And I knew that was
gonna happen.

35:49.150 --> 35:51.352
Obviously, I knew that she
was gonna go to college,

35:51.386 --> 35:53.053
But I guess
I just never realized

35:53.088 --> 35:55.089
The fact that all the colleges
she was gonna be applying to

35:55.123 --> 35:57.791
Were, like, on the other side
of the country.

35:59.628 --> 36:02.863
And now, you know, I started
just getting mad at her

36:02.897 --> 36:03.964
For no reason.

36:03.999 --> 36:05.766
It's like I resent it,

36:05.800 --> 36:08.235
But she never asked me
to stay here, you know?

36:08.270 --> 36:09.970
That was my decision.

36:10.005 --> 36:13.073
I decided to do that.

36:13.108 --> 36:15.109
I decided that.

36:17.279 --> 36:20.214
Well...

36:20.248 --> 36:24.151
Texas forever, right?

36:24.185 --> 36:25.919
- Yes.
Absolutely.

36:25.954 --> 36:27.955
Texas forever, 7.

36:36.665 --> 36:39.233
- I don't know
why he changed his mind.

36:39.267 --> 36:41.468
- Well, I think it's gonna be
a great pep rally.

36:41.503 --> 36:43.971
- We'll see about that.
Watch your step.

36:44.005 --> 36:46.440
- Hey, if it's not great,

36:46.474 --> 36:49.810
You still get
to come home with us.

36:49.844 --> 36:52.313
- There's always that.
- There's always that, right?

36:52.347 --> 36:54.048
Go ahead.

36:54.082 --> 37:02.389
âª âª

37:33.188 --> 37:34.922
- Hey.

37:34.956 --> 37:37.124
- Hey.

37:37.158 --> 37:38.258
Where's your brisket?

37:38.293 --> 37:41.528
- Oh, um,
I don't eat meat.

37:41.563 --> 37:43.263
- Oh, come on, let me
go get you a plate.

37:43.298 --> 37:44.465
- It's okay.

37:44.499 --> 37:46.066
Um, I actually
kind of wanted to talk to you

37:46.101 --> 37:47.201
About the other night.

37:47.235 --> 37:49.536
Um, I just wanted
to let you know

37:49.571 --> 37:51.839
That I'm not gonna
tell anybody or anything.

37:51.873 --> 37:54.341
- Tell anybody what?

37:54.376 --> 37:55.843
- I want to thank everybody
for coming out...

37:55.877 --> 37:57.177
- Uh, it's okay.

37:57.212 --> 37:58.946
- To east dillon's
first pep rally of the year.

37:58.980 --> 38:00.447
[cheers and applause]

38:02.550 --> 38:04.184
I'd like to introduce

38:04.219 --> 38:06.887
One of texas' great
high school football teams--

38:06.921 --> 38:10.023
1983 state champions
from east dillon high...

38:10.058 --> 38:12.226
[cheers and applause]

38:12.260 --> 38:14.495
And what they brought home
to this school

38:14.529 --> 38:15.796
26 years ago.

38:15.830 --> 38:17.765
[applause]

38:17.799 --> 38:18.866
Come on up, guys.

38:18.900 --> 38:20.634
- Yeah!

38:20.668 --> 38:23.971
- Let us pray.

38:24.005 --> 38:27.341
Lord...

38:27.375 --> 38:29.977
We are gathered here today

38:30.011 --> 38:33.547
For a reason.

38:33.581 --> 38:38.519
We ask you, lord,
what is a group of lions?

38:38.553 --> 38:42.356
It is a pride.

38:42.390 --> 38:46.326
And we stand before you
today, lord,

38:46.361 --> 38:48.562
Your pride.

38:50.398 --> 38:54.401
We need pride in this world.

38:54.436 --> 38:55.536
[man shouts]

38:55.570 --> 38:58.038
- And what do we have here?

38:58.072 --> 39:00.007
I said, "what do we have here?"

39:00.041 --> 39:02.042
All: Pride!

39:02.076 --> 39:03.444
[cheers and applause]

39:07.081 --> 39:09.316
We are the lions.

39:09.350 --> 39:13.654
And we stand together.

39:13.688 --> 39:15.589
Who are we?

39:15.623 --> 39:17.724
All: Lions!
- Who are we?

39:17.759 --> 39:19.226
All: Lions!

39:19.260 --> 39:21.395
[cheers and applause]

39:40.715 --> 39:41.882
- This--yeah.

39:41.916 --> 39:43.250
Put this one there.

39:43.284 --> 39:45.752
I never really wash this.

39:45.787 --> 39:47.421
It's kind of weird.
I just--

39:47.455 --> 39:55.429
âª âª

40:09.844 --> 40:12.913
- We're not dating, right?

40:12.947 --> 40:14.414
âª âª

40:14.449 --> 40:17.851
- Definitely not.
No.

40:17.886 --> 40:25.192
âª âª

40:49.951 --> 40:52.119
- Lorraine, I'm tossing
this half-and-half.

40:52.153 --> 40:54.588
- Well, all right, but we're
gonna have to go to the store.

40:54.622 --> 40:56.523
I cannot drink coffee
without cream.

40:56.558 --> 40:57.691
- Well, me neither.

40:57.725 --> 40:59.793
- Oh, I remember how you took
your coffee.

40:59.827 --> 41:01.328
[knock at door]

41:01.362 --> 41:04.531
Well, who could that be?

41:04.566 --> 41:06.800
[scoffs]
you failed me.

41:06.834 --> 41:08.535
âª âª

41:08.570 --> 41:09.803
- Mrs. Saracen?

41:09.837 --> 41:17.844
âª âª

41:32.560 --> 41:34.928
- Thanks.

41:34.963 --> 41:42.970
âª âª

41:51.145 --> 41:52.913
Hey, uh, look.

41:52.947 --> 41:56.083
I'm sorry, you know, that
I just stopped by, but I--

41:56.117 --> 41:59.486
What's the matter?

41:59.520 --> 42:01.254
- Have you talked to your mom?

42:01.289 --> 42:04.524
- Why?

42:04.559 --> 42:07.561
Is it--is--is something wrong
with grandma?

42:07.595 --> 42:09.429
- I'm sorry.

42:09.464 --> 42:12.232
- What's the matter?

42:12.266 --> 42:14.167
Julie.

42:14.202 --> 42:17.170
- It's your dad.

42:17.205 --> 42:19.940
He was killed.

42:19.974 --> 42:23.410
Sorry.

42:23.444 --> 42:24.811
I'm sorry.
