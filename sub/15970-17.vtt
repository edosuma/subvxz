02:26.680 --> 02:28.320

02:30.000 --> 02:32.400
My, isn't the moonlight terrible?

02:32.480 --> 02:34.200
And choir practice going on.

02:36.040 --> 02:37.840
I think if you hold your breath,

02:37.920 --> 02:39.880
you can hear the train
all the way to Kentucky.

02:39.960 --> 02:43.200
-Wow. Abbysinia Churchill's auditioning?
-Yeah, she's good.

02:43.280 --> 02:46.680
Look at her. She's really good.
Screw this.

02:46.760 --> 02:49.560
(Angela) Rayanne... don't
let her being good psyche you out.

02:49.640 --> 02:51.600
I can't believe I let you
talk me into auditioning

02:51.680 --> 02:55.560
for this stupid play, <i>Our Town.</i>

02:55.640 --> 02:58.720
Rayanne, you can do this.
Do what you did last night.

02:58.800 --> 03:01.280
-You should've seen her.
-Stage fright is, like, normal.

03:01.360 --> 03:03.320
Thanks for the newsflash,
Mr. Drama.

03:03.400 --> 03:05.120
Just 'cause you're crashing
at the teacher's.

03:05.200 --> 03:06.920
You should have seen her
at my house last night.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.680
-She, like, became Emily.
-I became you.

03:09.760 --> 03:12.280
Emily's supposed to be sweet
and innocent.

03:12.960 --> 03:15.840
-So?
-So I just imitated you.

03:15.920 --> 03:19.080
-You really think I'm sweet and innocent?
-Was I really good?

03:19.160 --> 03:22.720
Holly Galanoy's up there.
That's GA. You're next.

03:22.800 --> 03:26.160
If you knew the dream I had
about Corey Helfrick last night,

03:26.240 --> 03:28.520
you wouldn't think me
sweet and innocent.

03:28.600 --> 03:31.960
-An erotic dream about Corey?
-Join the club.

03:32.040 --> 03:35.560
Anyway, it proved one thing.
I am so over Jordan Catalano.

03:35.640 --> 03:38.680
-We've all heard that before.
-This time I mean it.

03:38.760 --> 03:41.960
He was only my boyfriend
for a split second.

03:42.040 --> 03:45.280
I don't think we were
really meant for each other.

03:45.360 --> 03:47.640
As friends maybe, but that's it.

03:47.720 --> 03:50.640
It's such a relief
to have my life back.

03:50.720 --> 03:54.400
-Uh, Rayanne Graff!
-Think of it this way.

03:54.480 --> 03:57.400
Acting's like lying.
Who's a better liar than you?

03:57.480 --> 04:00.040
When something matters to you,
you do this, like,

04:00.120 --> 04:04.280
hair flick thing and your eyes
get all wide and you stand sort of...

04:05.160 --> 04:09.440
-Quit studying me. Get out there.
-(Katimski) Rayanne Graff.

04:29.120 --> 04:31.520
I just can't sleep yet, papa.

04:31.600 --> 04:33.440
The moonlight's so wonderful.

04:34.600 --> 04:36.880
And the smell of miss Gibb's
heliotropes...

04:37.480 --> 04:38.600
can you smell it?

04:40.080 --> 04:42.320
Okay, I like the layout,

04:42.400 --> 04:44.840
but principal Foster's
name has to be bigger

04:44.920 --> 04:48.680
than the vice-principal's or he'll
have a total cow. Oh, what's this?

04:48.760 --> 04:51.000
-About that...
-Those are the after-school club photos.

04:51.080 --> 04:55.000
We don't have room
for all the after-school clubs.

04:55.080 --> 04:57.920
Leave out those with less
than five people.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.080
-None have more than five.
-Chess club has six.

05:03.880 --> 05:06.600
-Sometimes.
-I'll fix Foster's name.

05:06.680 --> 05:08.560
Great. You're the best.
Where's that petty cash receipt?

05:08.640 --> 05:10.080
Oh, I'll get it.

05:11.640 --> 05:13.120
Look, about...

05:13.680 --> 05:17.240
um, so,
the budget for the video...

05:17.320 --> 05:21.120
Foster didn't even want
a year-end video. I had to basically beg.

05:21.200 --> 05:22.680
So keep it simple.

05:22.760 --> 05:27.200
Just a few candid shots of people
hanging out where people hang out.

05:27.280 --> 05:28.680
Oh, okay.

05:28.760 --> 05:31.440
So where do people hang out?

05:32.760 --> 05:35.360
I'll bet your pal Abbysinia got it.

05:35.440 --> 05:38.840
-You must be so proud.
-Shut up. I barley know Abyssinia.

05:38.920 --> 05:42.840
-I'm proud of you. You were great.
-I didn't cry right.

05:42.920 --> 05:44.840
I should've cried more like you.

05:44.920 --> 05:47.480
You know, your little first...
whew!

05:47.560 --> 05:50.200
And then your, like,
mouth collapses.

05:50.280 --> 05:51.920
(indistinct chatter)

05:52.000 --> 05:54.920
-Why are you crying like Ange...
-Shut up! I do not cry like that.

05:55.000 --> 05:59.120
-You do so! Oh, my God! Corey Helfrick.
-Oh, yeah. Right.

05:59.200 --> 06:02.440
He's wearing a towel, right?
I had this dream last night.

06:02.520 --> 06:05.200
-Angela.
-He was wearing this really weird towel

06:05.280 --> 06:08.280
-made of saltines. It kept crumbling.
-Hi.

06:08.360 --> 06:09.400
-Hi.
-Hi.

06:09.480 --> 06:11.360
-Hi. (gushes)
-Nice cry.

06:12.320 --> 06:14.960
-Your audition.
-You're in drama club?

06:15.040 --> 06:16.760
Yeah, he paints scenery.

06:17.520 --> 06:19.800
I mean, probably.

06:20.280 --> 06:23.720
That's right. You paint.
That's really... that's really...

06:23.800 --> 06:25.000
that's interesting.

06:25.080 --> 06:26.600
So, Corey, forget painting.

06:26.680 --> 06:27.920
When you eat soup,

06:28.000 --> 06:34.080
what kind of crackers would you like
to have with it? (laughs)

06:35.240 --> 06:38.040
-(mellow music playing)
-(indistinct chatter)

06:41.440 --> 06:44.040
Um, so what's the scenery
going to be like?

06:44.120 --> 06:46.560
-For <i>Our Town.</i>
-You really want to know?

06:46.640 --> 06:48.920
Oh, yeah, of course.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.280
So is it going to be, like,
realistic or...

06:51.360 --> 06:54.560
Well, it's supposed to be almost
artificial in a way.

06:54.640 --> 06:56.160
When the play
was first produced...

06:56.240 --> 06:58.720
(Angela)<i> I like him. I do.</i>

06:59.520 --> 07:02.280
<i>I want to pay this much attention</i>
<i>to every word he says...</i>

07:03.360 --> 07:05.920
<i>not just because</i>
<i>Jordan Catalano's watching.</i>

07:06.000 --> 07:07.520
(Corey) That's what he wanted...

07:08.200 --> 07:09.280
Thornton Wilder.

07:09.880 --> 07:13.800
Maybe I could, you know,
help or something.

07:13.880 --> 07:17.360
-I didn't know you were interested in art.
-Oh, yeah. Definitely.

07:17.440 --> 07:21.800
I'm definitely interested.
I'd love to. Definitely.

07:23.000 --> 07:27.360
-Love to what?
-You know, help or something.

07:29.880 --> 07:31.800
(telephone rings)

07:31.880 --> 07:33.600
If that's Hallie, I'm not here.

07:34.440 --> 07:36.200
She'll ask
what I thought of the prospectus.

07:36.280 --> 07:39.680
-I haven't cracked it yet.
-You can't tell her that?

07:41.440 --> 07:43.920
(rings)

07:44.520 --> 07:46.840
Hello. Hey, there!

07:47.320 --> 07:48.320
Yeah.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.520
-Off the hook.
-Yeah, maybe for now.

07:51.600 --> 07:54.000
Hello. Oh, hi, Camille.

07:54.680 --> 07:58.480
Yeah, I guess he is.
She says you sound happy. Uh-huh.

07:59.280 --> 08:03.960
Sure! We've got tons of stuff.
I'll get started tonight.

08:04.040 --> 08:05.000
Okay.

08:05.640 --> 08:08.480
Well, just let me know.
Goodbye, babe.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.800
Clothing drive at her church.

08:11.880 --> 08:15.120
Oh, good. I have two or three things
I can donate.

08:15.200 --> 08:19.040
-(scoffs) What? Two or three?
-Well, two.

08:19.600 --> 08:23.520
-You have tons of clothes you never wear.
-Doesn't mean I never will.

08:24.480 --> 08:26.040
Oh, I forgot.

08:26.120 --> 08:29.280
The one with the oldest clothes
when they die wins.

08:29.360 --> 08:32.120
(telephone rings)

08:33.040 --> 08:37.800
-Only if get free reign over your closet.
-(rings)

08:40.560 --> 08:43.520
-(rings)
-(Patty sighs)

08:43.600 --> 08:46.400
Hello. Oh, hi, Hallie!

08:47.240 --> 08:50.440
I know. It's all happening so fast,
it's wonderful. (chuckles)

08:51.000 --> 08:54.120
Yes, he is here...
but he's in the shower.

08:56.760 --> 08:57.840
Uh-huh.

08:58.760 --> 08:59.760
Okay.

09:00.720 --> 09:03.600
-(indistinct chatter)
-(music playing in background)

09:15.360 --> 09:17.760
(Rayanne talking indistinctly)

09:18.360 --> 09:21.640
<i>-Don't put that in my face.</i>
<i>-See, she's upset.</i>

09:22.560 --> 09:24.160
She auditioned
for <i>Our Town</i> and...

09:24.240 --> 09:26.680
<i>You don't have to tell the whole world.</i>

09:26.760 --> 09:32.200
<i>It's just a stupid play.</i>
<i>Dead people come back and visit.</i>

09:32.280 --> 09:36.160
<i>-Like that's really going to happen.</i>
<i>-Excuse us.</i>

09:37.200 --> 09:38.880
<i>It's a school play anyway.</i>

09:40.480 --> 09:43.320
-(indistinct chatter)
-(music playing in background)

09:52.480 --> 09:55.720
Look, I'm not going to hang out here
just to watch you get plastered.

09:55.800 --> 09:57.920
I've been so good,
and you know it.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.880
That's not the point.
The point is... just forget it.

10:08.640 --> 10:09.920
Hey.

10:11.280 --> 10:12.200
Can I have some of that?

10:13.160 --> 10:15.080
Why not?
You got another one of those?

10:15.800 --> 10:16.880
Yeah.

10:17.960 --> 10:20.280
-(indistinct chatter)
-(music playing in background)

10:30.240 --> 10:31.440
(Jordan groans)

10:32.360 --> 10:34.000
Here. Before I finish it.

10:34.080 --> 10:36.240
Oh, no. It's cool.
Have as much as you want.

10:37.960 --> 10:39.080
I'm drunk.

10:40.080 --> 10:41.400
Yeah, me, too.

10:43.560 --> 10:44.760
But not enough.

10:45.840 --> 10:47.120
So, Graff...

10:49.160 --> 10:50.320
who are you here with?

10:51.000 --> 10:54.320
If you mean where's Angela,
she didn't come.

10:55.160 --> 10:56.480
As like usual.

10:59.520 --> 11:02.320
-So let me ask you something.
-Wasn't even my idea.

11:04.440 --> 11:06.440
To audition for the stupid play.

11:07.400 --> 11:11.160
(scoffs) It was Angela's.
Right, like I could be Emily.

11:11.240 --> 11:12.640
Emily who?

11:12.720 --> 11:16.520
It's this part in this stupid
<i>Our Town</i> play.

11:17.320 --> 11:20.560
It was just wishful thinking.
No, I could never be her.

11:20.640 --> 11:23.720
Angela could be her.

11:25.080 --> 11:28.480
-Oh, yeah?
-She's exactly like Angela.

11:28.560 --> 11:29.640
I mean...

11:30.840 --> 11:33.720
you know she's... so innocent...

11:34.640 --> 11:37.400
that, like, she doesn't know
she's innocent.

11:37.480 --> 11:40.040
(mellow music playing)

11:40.120 --> 11:41.120
Yeah.

11:41.720 --> 11:43.800
And she always says stuff
like...

11:45.320 --> 11:47.640
my, isn't the moonlight terrible?

11:49.000 --> 11:52.040
Yeah, she's always saying
innocent stuff like that.

11:53.680 --> 11:54.840
No, I meant...

11:55.480 --> 11:57.800
I meant... never mind.

11:58.440 --> 12:02.440
Does she like that guy
I keep seeing her talking to... Corey?

12:02.520 --> 12:03.720
Or what?

12:03.800 --> 12:07.280
(mellow music continues)

12:07.360 --> 12:08.960
You know, it's hard to say.

12:10.680 --> 12:12.240
Sometimes it's like...

12:14.240 --> 12:17.840
I really think I know her.
And then it'll be like...

12:19.040 --> 12:22.720
-like we're total strangers.
-I know.

12:22.800 --> 12:26.120
(somber music playing)

12:26.200 --> 12:27.960
Hey, Catalano...

12:31.400 --> 12:32.600
it's cool.

12:37.600 --> 12:39.080
All right.

12:40.480 --> 12:41.560
Hey.

12:47.480 --> 12:49.600
(calm music playing)

13:05.400 --> 13:06.840

14:50.120 --> 14:52.440
-Oh, sorry.
-Jeez. Sorry.

14:52.520 --> 14:54.040
-Hi.
-Hi.

14:54.120 --> 14:57.080
-Oh, I should tell you...
-Hi.

14:57.160 --> 14:59.480
-Hi.
-Hi.

14:59.560 --> 15:02.760
-You should tell me...
-We're painting the oak tree.

15:02.840 --> 15:06.320
-We could use more people.
-Oh, that sounds great.

15:06.400 --> 15:08.520
-Doesn't it?
-Yeah. Let's do it.

15:08.600 --> 15:13.120
-So, we'll see you then.
-Okay. See ya.

15:15.560 --> 15:18.920
So, that sounds like fun.
You know, painting.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.760
-Definitely.
-Good.

15:35.320 --> 15:36.680
(Rayanne) Hmm.

15:37.280 --> 15:38.840
(sighs)

15:45.160 --> 15:47.200
-So, when do they tell you?
-Huh?

15:47.280 --> 15:49.000
If you got the part.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.720
Oh. I don't know. Soon.

15:53.800 --> 15:55.600
I don't care. (sighs)

15:56.280 --> 15:59.400
My head is like... pounding.

15:59.960 --> 16:02.960
-I was really out of it last night.
-Yeah.

16:03.800 --> 16:06.600
-Me, too.
-I guess we both were.

16:09.520 --> 16:12.160
-(bell rings)
-Okay. So...

16:12.240 --> 16:15.080
-Yeah. So...
-See ya.

16:15.160 --> 16:16.520
See ya.

16:19.880 --> 16:21.800
(knock on door)

16:21.880 --> 16:23.400
(door opens)

16:24.800 --> 16:27.880
-Hallie?
-Oh. Hi.

16:29.400 --> 16:32.800
-I thought you and Graham were meeting...
-We are.

16:32.880 --> 16:36.000
I can't be early.
I'm never early.

16:36.080 --> 16:39.080
But Graham's meeting you
at your office.

16:39.160 --> 16:43.040
-I thought we said we'd meet here. Oh!
-Oh.

16:44.000 --> 16:45.600
Well, come on in anyway.

16:45.680 --> 16:47.800
Camille Cherski,
this is Hallie Lowenthal.

16:47.880 --> 16:50.760
Oh, neat. The restaurateur,
or is it restaurantrice?

16:50.840 --> 16:53.920
-Uh... it's Hallie.
-Hi.

16:54.680 --> 16:59.000
(sighs) Damn.
Uh! I do this all the time.

16:59.080 --> 17:02.440
-Unless I write it down...
-Tell me. I'm the worst.

17:02.520 --> 17:05.440
I forget.
I would forget my name.

17:05.520 --> 17:07.800
I leave notes
for myself everywhere.

17:07.880 --> 17:09.720
-Bathroom mirror.
-Front door.

17:09.800 --> 17:12.680
In the car... for when I've
missed the one on the mirror.

17:12.760 --> 17:15.840
-(telephone rings)
-(Hallie chuckles)

17:15.920 --> 17:18.560
-(Patty) Hello.
-Clothes drive at the church.

17:18.640 --> 17:22.920
Graham. Yeah, she's here.
He knew you'd be here.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.200
-Hold on a second.
-(Hallie sighs)

17:25.840 --> 17:30.120
I'm sorry. (chuckles)
No. No, we're not even.

17:30.200 --> 17:32.200
At least I showed up
on the right day.

17:33.240 --> 17:36.400
Forget it. Forget it. Forget it.

17:37.080 --> 17:38.440
I'll be there in 10.

17:40.080 --> 17:41.600
He wants to know
do you need him.

17:41.680 --> 17:43.520
I'm not going to touch that one.

17:44.320 --> 17:46.320
Tell him I need paper towels.

17:46.400 --> 17:50.120
She says bring home
paper towels. Okay.

17:50.920 --> 17:52.640
-(slams telephone)
-Ah.

17:52.720 --> 17:54.800
Well, it was nice meeting...

17:55.640 --> 18:00.320
oh. Oh, God. It's so small.

18:00.400 --> 18:03.200
Oh, it was Angela's first dress.

18:03.280 --> 18:05.960
No. This was Danielle's.

18:06.040 --> 18:10.440
Ah. Baby clothes... (sighs)

18:10.520 --> 18:11.920
Break my heart.

18:12.440 --> 18:14.800
(sighs) I got to go.

18:15.400 --> 18:19.000
Let's get together again.
You know, you and, um...

18:19.080 --> 18:20.360
-oh.
-Brad.

18:20.440 --> 18:21.920
Brad. Yes.

18:22.720 --> 18:24.080
-Bye. Bye.
-Bye.

18:24.160 --> 18:27.040
Bye.

18:28.720 --> 18:31.880
Oh.
She's sweet, isn't she?

18:34.600 --> 18:35.880
Isn't she?

18:36.720 --> 18:38.520
-Yeah.
-Ha!

18:39.440 --> 18:42.960
-(bell rings)
-Krakow. Krakow.

18:43.560 --> 18:44.960
How'd it go last night?

18:46.720 --> 18:49.080
Krakow. Did you get anything?

18:50.320 --> 18:53.160
-Why? What did you hear?
-What? Nothing.

18:53.240 --> 18:56.360
Did you go to Louie's
like I suggested?

18:56.960 --> 18:58.520
Um, yeah, I did.

19:02.040 --> 19:03.480
-Hi.
-Hi.

19:05.720 --> 19:08.680
Krakow, did you get
any good candid's?

19:08.760 --> 19:11.560
-Um, yeah, I did.
-Great. Let me have the tape.

19:12.920 --> 19:15.400
-What?
-The tape... give it to me.

19:16.240 --> 19:19.240
-I can't. I mean...
-Is there a problem?

19:19.320 --> 19:20.800
Exactly.

19:20.880 --> 19:25.120
Look, my butt is on the line
with this video thing.

19:25.200 --> 19:26.840
What is the problem?

19:28.640 --> 19:31.480
Could you just...
excuse us for a second?

19:34.800 --> 19:36.120
Thanks.

19:38.280 --> 19:43.520
I couldn't believe it when he told me.
What am I supposed to do?

19:43.600 --> 19:45.920
Am I supposed to tell her?
I can't tell her.

19:46.000 --> 19:50.680
It's not my place to tell her.
Is that being a friend?

19:50.760 --> 19:53.440
Is it being more of a friend
to tell her or to not tell her?

19:53.520 --> 19:57.320
If I tell her, it's like saying

19:57.400 --> 20:01.160
"I told you so about Rayanne Graff."
It's not what I'd tell her.

20:01.240 --> 20:07.160
-See, I'd want to know. Wouldn't you?
-Yeah, definitely.

20:07.240 --> 20:10.200
Why did Brian Krakow
have to witness this?

20:10.280 --> 20:13.440
If Rayanne had to do this totally lowlife,
disgusting thing,

20:13.520 --> 20:16.120
couldn't she at least
have done it in private?

20:16.200 --> 20:17.360
(door squeaks)

20:19.880 --> 20:22.880
Hey, Rickie.
Is, um... is Rayanne...

20:22.960 --> 20:25.480
I mean, does she, like...
is Angela, like...

20:26.160 --> 20:30.160
hey, Brian. Could you, like,
pick a sentence and go with it?

20:31.440 --> 20:33.320
I have to talk to you.

20:33.400 --> 20:36.840
I have to talk to someone,
and you're, like, the only one left.

20:37.480 --> 20:39.840
(locker squeaking)

20:43.240 --> 20:46.920
-Rickie, you would not believe...
-Hey. Here's a brush.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.360
-Oh, thanks.
-Don't forget to wipe it off.

20:49.440 --> 20:50.520
I won't.

20:53.680 --> 20:56.640
You would not believe the number
Sharon Cherski just pulled on me.

20:58.560 --> 21:01.680
-Uh, like what?
-(laughs)

21:01.760 --> 21:04.400
Oh, like how Rayanne supposedly did it...

21:04.880 --> 21:06.400
with Jordan

21:06.480 --> 21:10.680
and how Brian Krakow, supposedly,
has proof of it, like, on video.

21:11.720 --> 21:14.120
I honestly believed
she was past this.

21:14.200 --> 21:16.360
I thought she was
over her jealousy of Rayanne,

21:16.440 --> 21:18.240
but I guess she isn't.

21:19.960 --> 21:22.440
Or else why would
she say something like that to me?

21:26.160 --> 21:27.480
Because it's true.

21:38.240 --> 21:42.040
(announcer) My so called life
<i>will continue here on ABC.</i>

21:46.920 --> 21:49.680
(theme music playing)

21:56.560 --> 21:58.040
(heavy metal playing loudly
on headphones)

21:58.120 --> 22:01.200
(Brian's father) Brian,
Angela Chase is here to see you.

22:02.800 --> 22:04.880
♪ <i>In my face</i> ♪

22:04.960 --> 22:06.840
♪ <i>Wild bill... </i>♪

22:06.920 --> 22:08.840
-Oh, sorry.
-What are you doing here?

22:09.720 --> 22:11.960
People should tell people
when they have visitors.

22:12.040 --> 22:15.000
(Brian's mother) Brian,
you didn't finish your oatmeal.

22:15.080 --> 22:17.160
-I need that tape.
-Huh?

22:17.800 --> 22:20.920
The tape, Brian,
I want to see it.

22:21.000 --> 22:24.680
-What are you talking about?
-Don't pretend you don't know.

22:24.760 --> 22:28.720
-This is partly your fault.
-This is my fault?

22:28.800 --> 22:32.200
-Look, I have other things on it.
-I don't care.

22:32.280 --> 22:33.360
Hey.

22:34.680 --> 22:35.880
You shouldn't see it.

22:37.400 --> 22:39.640
I don't think you really
want to see it.

22:41.960 --> 22:43.360
It'll just make you feel worse.

22:44.480 --> 22:48.800
(birds chirping)

22:48.880 --> 22:51.400
(woman) Okay. Good.
Try to watch your form.

22:51.480 --> 22:54.800
-(whistles)
-Okay. Nice.

22:55.760 --> 22:57.920
Better. Good job.

22:58.000 --> 22:59.800
-(whistles)
-Graff, get in line.

22:59.880 --> 23:01.360
I'm late.

23:02.960 --> 23:06.160
(woman) Dorrick, you're vaulting.
Corbin, you spot her.

23:07.120 --> 23:10.600
-Sullivan and London, you're up.
-Get ahead of me.

23:12.000 --> 23:13.440
(woman) Come on.

23:13.520 --> 23:15.960
Cooke and Thompson, listen up.

23:16.560 --> 23:18.160
Watch your form.

23:19.160 --> 23:20.120
Good.

23:21.200 --> 23:24.440
-Make sure you know who your partner is.
-Can I get in front of you?

23:24.520 --> 23:28.160
-Sure
-(woman) More power next time.

23:28.240 --> 23:29.680
All right.

23:30.280 --> 23:32.520
That looks good.

23:32.600 --> 23:35.480
-Chase and Graff, you're next.
-(whistle blows)

23:36.480 --> 23:38.040
(sighs)

23:38.120 --> 23:39.440
(bell rings)

23:39.520 --> 23:43.200
-Good.
-The bell. Shower time.

23:43.280 --> 23:45.320
When are you coming back, girls?

23:45.400 --> 23:47.720
-(toilet flushes)
-Hey, Cherski.

23:47.800 --> 23:50.400
-Sharon, are you coming?
-She'll be there in a minute.

23:53.640 --> 23:55.520
So, congratulations.
Your dream came true.

23:55.600 --> 23:56.680
What dream?

23:56.760 --> 23:59.960
You got an ironclad perfect excuse
never to talk to me again.

24:00.040 --> 24:02.160
You should be celebrating.

24:02.240 --> 24:04.720
You think I'm happy about this?

24:04.800 --> 24:06.400
Somebody I care about
has been hurt.

24:06.480 --> 24:08.880
You couldn't wait
to tell them the news.

24:08.960 --> 24:11.040
Don't turn this around on me.

24:11.120 --> 24:14.400
-I said that to protect her.
-Protect her. Crock.

24:14.480 --> 24:18.120
That's right! So she would know.
Because it's what you do...

24:18.640 --> 24:19.840
when someone's your friend.

24:22.120 --> 24:23.800
You brought this on yourself.

24:24.600 --> 24:26.160
And you're just so happy I did.

24:28.400 --> 24:29.520
No...

24:30.440 --> 24:34.080
-I'm not.
-(toilet flushes)

24:34.160 --> 24:35.200
Not at all.

24:35.280 --> 24:38.200
(indistinct chatter)

24:44.560 --> 24:47.600
-(indistinct chatter)
-(bell dings)

24:47.680 --> 24:49.800
I know, I know, I'm late.

24:49.880 --> 24:52.480
Getting across town was insane.
Forget parking.

24:52.560 --> 24:55.680
-I'm in a really... weird space.
-You brought Chinese?

24:55.760 --> 24:59.720
Think I'd eat the food here?
It's like blood sausage or scrapple.

24:59.800 --> 25:02.240
(Graham sighs)
Well, shouldn't you move it?

25:02.320 --> 25:05.240
-I mean, the car.
-Oh. In a minute. Come on.

25:05.320 --> 25:06.760
So? Hmm?

25:07.360 --> 25:08.880
What did you think
of the prospectus?

25:10.760 --> 25:13.520
-You still haven't read it, have you?
-What?

25:15.480 --> 25:17.160
You're afraid to read the prospectus,
aren't you?

25:17.240 --> 25:18.520
I'm what?

25:18.600 --> 25:21.800
It's understandable.
This is a huge risk for you.

25:21.880 --> 25:23.080
Not that big of a risk.

25:23.160 --> 25:25.800
Yes, it is.
You're risking everything. Eat.

25:25.880 --> 25:28.720
(sighs) Look... ooh. (sniffs)

25:28.800 --> 25:30.080
We're about to become partners.

25:30.160 --> 25:32.800
We have to tell each other the truth,
or it'll never work.

25:32.880 --> 25:35.520
Let's dig into that prospectus,

25:35.600 --> 25:38.440
and we don't quit
until it's comprehended by both of us.

25:42.080 --> 25:44.400
-What?
-Nothing. It's just...

25:46.160 --> 25:48.120
you can be a real
pain in the ass.

25:49.440 --> 25:51.600
I know. Honey,
I'm a Jewish girl from Texas.

25:51.680 --> 25:53.400
I'm your worst nightmare.

25:55.640 --> 25:58.600
-You could drive a sane person crazy.
-Me? What did I do?

25:58.680 --> 26:00.120
Nothing.

26:01.480 --> 26:06.280
Except... every time we have a damn
conversation, it's like the first one.

26:06.360 --> 26:08.320
I can't make any damn headway.

26:11.840 --> 26:16.640
-Show me the damn prospectus.
-(indistinct chatter)

26:19.600 --> 26:21.080
I have to move my car.

26:24.360 --> 26:25.680
(doorbell rings)

26:27.480 --> 26:28.600
Rayanne!

26:29.560 --> 26:31.600
Oh! Angela's not here.

26:31.680 --> 26:36.200
She's, um... she's painting scenery
every night this week

26:36.280 --> 26:38.680
-with the drama club.
-Really?

26:38.760 --> 26:40.080
Of course.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.160
-Want to come in?
-There?

26:44.000 --> 26:44.840
Yeah.

26:47.160 --> 26:50.280
-No. Thanks. I guess I should...
-Are you sure?

26:55.040 --> 26:56.280
Don't tell her I was here.

26:57.880 --> 27:01.240
I guess I know you will
'cause you guys are tight.

27:01.320 --> 27:02.800
Tight?

27:02.880 --> 27:05.280
She doesn't tell you everything,
but you know.

27:05.360 --> 27:07.000
No.

27:07.080 --> 27:12.120
But, like, if something
really horrible happened.

27:13.240 --> 27:16.480
Did something
really horrible happen?

27:17.400 --> 27:18.600
Guess.

27:19.160 --> 27:23.680
But... I really didn't think it was.
She said she was over him.

27:23.760 --> 27:25.880
-Jordan?
-Otherwise I...

27:26.600 --> 27:27.600
I would never have done it.

27:27.680 --> 27:31.520
I mean, 'cause it's not something
either of us really...

27:32.800 --> 27:34.760
it was just like this...
thing...

27:35.680 --> 27:37.280
that, like, happened.

27:38.840 --> 27:40.240
He was just, like...

27:41.520 --> 27:42.520
there.

27:44.520 --> 27:47.080
You and Jordan...

27:48.880 --> 27:49.960
You hate my guts.

27:51.080 --> 27:54.560
I mean, I guess I would, too,
if I were you.

27:54.640 --> 27:55.600
No.

27:56.360 --> 27:58.000
No, no. I don't hate you.

27:58.720 --> 28:03.200
I mean, I guess I can certainly
understand how Angela feels.

28:03.280 --> 28:04.240
Yeah.

28:07.920 --> 28:09.080
I've never...

28:09.840 --> 28:13.080
really hurt somebody this bad before.

28:15.080 --> 28:17.480
It's hard to believe. I mean...

28:18.200 --> 28:21.560
I guess you can't really hurt
someone this bad...

28:25.080 --> 28:26.840
unless you really matter to them.

28:29.800 --> 28:32.360
Please don't tell her I was here.

28:32.440 --> 28:34.840
(door opens, closes)

28:34.920 --> 28:37.240
(indistinct chatter)

28:46.560 --> 28:48.840
Want it? Here.
Here. Here it is, okay?

28:48.920 --> 28:52.120
Take it. Just... satisfied?

28:57.000 --> 29:00.120
You know... it doesn't matter
who has the stupid tape.

29:00.200 --> 29:02.680
It happened.
It can't be, like, erased.

29:03.520 --> 29:06.120
I was just gonna ask
if we could skip tutoring today.

29:07.400 --> 29:09.440
Oh. Um...

29:12.320 --> 29:13.760
So, what was on the tape?

29:17.320 --> 29:20.280
-(bell rings)
-Hey, Vasquez, wait up.

29:20.360 --> 29:24.040
-You've been like impossible to find.
-Well, I'm right here.

29:24.120 --> 29:28.080
-How long are you going to keep this up?
-Keep what up?

29:28.160 --> 29:30.120
Come on, you and Angela.
The silent treatment.

29:30.200 --> 29:33.240
-I'm talking to you now.
-Barely.

29:33.840 --> 29:36.360
Yeah, well, Rayanne,
what exact reaction did you expect?

29:38.240 --> 29:39.400
Forget it.

29:40.040 --> 29:42.840
What did you expect her to feel like?

29:42.920 --> 29:44.920
She didn't even hear my side.

29:47.320 --> 29:50.520
Great. Go ahead. Think what you want.
You will anyway.

29:51.400 --> 29:53.120
(water starts running, stops)

29:53.680 --> 29:54.680
Oh.

30:01.600 --> 30:05.240
-Angela.
-Oh. Hi.

30:05.320 --> 30:07.480
-I mean...
-Hi.

30:07.560 --> 30:10.440
-Well... bye.
-Bye.

30:11.520 --> 30:14.080
Angela? I know you're in here.

30:16.200 --> 30:18.480
-I'm sorry. I have to be alone.
-You've been alone.

30:18.560 --> 30:22.080
-I mean, for, like, years.
-Look...

30:22.160 --> 30:23.720
I can't believe it!

30:24.680 --> 30:26.240
That they would do that.

30:27.280 --> 30:31.160
-Who do they think they are?
-I know. I mean...

30:31.240 --> 30:33.920
-I don't know.
-I could kill them!

30:34.000 --> 30:37.320
-I'm serious. Both of them, with my hands.
-I know.

30:38.240 --> 30:41.560
But you...
you can't hide in here forever.

30:41.640 --> 30:42.840
I'm sorry. I'm not...

30:44.400 --> 30:49.320
-risking the risk of running into her.
-Or him.

30:50.200 --> 30:51.640
God, him.

30:52.840 --> 30:53.760
And her.

30:54.920 --> 30:56.880
Well, that's never
going to happen...

30:57.840 --> 31:00.240
'cause they're, like, completely
avoiding each other.

31:00.320 --> 31:01.800
I can't talk about...

31:06.160 --> 31:07.560
them, like...

31:10.040 --> 31:11.400
a them.

31:12.280 --> 31:13.320
I know.

31:17.200 --> 31:18.920
Are they, like, avoiding
each other?

31:20.040 --> 31:21.760
Angela, look.

31:23.880 --> 31:26.920
You can let their stupid actions,
like, control you.

31:29.400 --> 31:31.400
You got to lead your own life.

31:33.240 --> 31:34.560
You're right.

31:37.120 --> 31:39.800
Fine. Fine!

31:42.360 --> 31:44.040
Two can play at that game.

31:45.160 --> 31:46.440
What game?

31:47.840 --> 31:51.760
They think I'm some innocent little twit
who they can treat as bad as they want.

31:54.080 --> 31:55.440
Well, they're wrong.

32:00.680 --> 32:03.680
-Thanks.
-(door shuts)

32:03.760 --> 32:04.880
You're welcome.

32:06.680 --> 32:08.080
I can't believe it!

32:08.160 --> 32:09.960
-All right!
-Yeah!

32:10.040 --> 32:11.800
(squealing)

32:16.080 --> 32:20.480
-I can't believe it!
-Yeah!

32:20.560 --> 32:23.960
(mellow music playing)

32:33.720 --> 32:35.800
Angela, hey!

32:41.280 --> 32:43.360
(somber music playing)

33:02.560 --> 33:05.040
-(keys jingle)
-(door lock clicks)

33:05.120 --> 33:07.840
Hey, clothes drive is over.

33:07.920 --> 33:09.120
-Let's celebrate.
-(door closes)

33:09.200 --> 33:12.920
Let's go shopping.
Let's buy a lot of new clothes.

33:13.000 --> 33:16.680
Things that we won't wear, so we'll
have something to donate next year.

33:16.760 --> 33:19.280
Oh, by the way,
what's the scoop?

33:19.360 --> 33:22.400
I hear that Angela and Rayanne
aren't speaking.

33:23.440 --> 33:27.160
-Oh, I, uh... really?
-(fridge door closes)

33:29.720 --> 33:32.040
Sharon won't dish the dirt.
What happened?

33:32.120 --> 33:35.360
I... (scoffs) haven't got a clue.

33:35.920 --> 33:38.240
You know what I didn't tell you?

33:38.320 --> 33:41.280
They're getting the lease,
Graham and Hallie Lowenthal.

33:41.360 --> 33:43.080
(pours liquid)

33:46.160 --> 33:47.800
You don't think
Graham's going to follow through.

33:47.880 --> 33:49.720
No. It's not Graham.

33:49.800 --> 33:51.360
It's that Hallie person.

33:52.880 --> 33:54.600
-I don't like her.
-(Patty chuckles)

33:54.680 --> 33:58.280
Camille, you met her for,
like, two minutes.

33:58.360 --> 34:00.680
No. I don't like her.

34:00.760 --> 34:03.200
All right, fine.
You don't like her.

34:04.360 --> 34:05.920
You know, she has a fiancé.

34:06.920 --> 34:08.600
What can I say?

34:08.680 --> 34:10.960
-She and Graham get along.
-That's a good sign.

34:11.040 --> 34:13.760
-They work well together.
-They get along.

34:13.840 --> 34:15.800
That's good. That's very good.

34:15.880 --> 34:18.920
-Very good sign.
-Why?

34:21.040 --> 34:22.360
Let's put it this way.

34:23.200 --> 34:26.920
Susie Bertolucci realized
her husband was having an affair

34:27.000 --> 34:29.520
when he started arguing
with his secretary.

34:29.600 --> 34:32.880
If you can get that angry with somebody,
there's passion involved.

34:36.000 --> 34:39.520
Well, that's not the situation,
in my humble opinion.

34:40.240 --> 34:41.400
That's good.

34:42.880 --> 34:44.680
Aaagh! Camille.

34:45.480 --> 34:47.720
I love you.
You are such a good friend.

34:48.360 --> 34:49.560
I know.

34:50.120 --> 34:53.520
(indistinct chatter)

34:53.600 --> 34:54.640
Angela.

34:57.400 --> 34:58.440
Hey.

35:01.360 --> 35:03.280
-Didn't you hear me?
-No.

35:03.360 --> 35:08.920
(indistinct chatter)

35:10.400 --> 35:11.360
Here.

35:12.840 --> 35:16.160
-Why are you giving this to me?
-'Cause it's yours.

35:16.240 --> 35:17.760
I don't want it.

35:18.600 --> 35:20.800
-Well, it's your pen.
-So?

35:20.880 --> 35:23.360
You loaned it to me
in Katimski's, remember?

35:24.960 --> 35:26.240
Not really.

35:32.040 --> 35:33.680
Well, if it's not yours, give it back.

35:36.960 --> 35:37.920
No.

35:38.000 --> 35:44.480
(indistinct chatter)

35:49.240 --> 35:51.200
I was influenced by Spielberg,

35:51.280 --> 35:56.320
but I think my recent work is more
like Tarantino, only less violent.

35:57.880 --> 35:59.200
Oh, my God.

36:01.040 --> 36:04.560
-Hello.
-Hi. Grab a brush.

36:04.640 --> 36:08.640
-Can I talk to you for a second?
-Sure.

36:10.640 --> 36:13.720
-Are you okay?
-Yes. God.

36:20.920 --> 36:22.720
Do you have anything
to drink or anything?

36:22.800 --> 36:23.760
You drink?

36:25.040 --> 36:26.600
Why not? Why shouldn't I?

36:26.680 --> 36:28.800
-I don't know.
-I'm too innocent?

36:28.880 --> 36:32.080
-I'm sick of being like that.
-Well, uh...

36:34.000 --> 36:38.120
-Angela!
-Is there something really wrong with me?

36:38.200 --> 36:39.640
No. Just...

36:39.720 --> 36:42.400
Could we just get really drunk
or something?

36:43.080 --> 36:46.400
What are you talking about?
You don't drink. Excuse us.

36:46.480 --> 36:47.520
Get away from me.

36:48.680 --> 36:50.080
Well, I got the part.

36:51.920 --> 36:54.680
I would never have gotten it
if it wasn't for you.

36:55.960 --> 36:58.200
Look, I don't care anymore,
okay?

36:59.000 --> 37:00.640
So just go away.

37:01.840 --> 37:03.920
You're not the only one
who got hurt.

37:06.080 --> 37:08.560
Forgive me if I can't feel sorry
for you.

37:08.640 --> 37:10.920
You lost nothing, Angela.

37:11.000 --> 37:14.440
You lost a lousy, selfish friend,
a guy you never had.

37:14.520 --> 37:16.200
You lost nothing.

37:19.120 --> 37:22.560
I lost a really good friend.

37:26.480 --> 37:27.840
I lost everything.

37:29.440 --> 37:31.600
(footsteps receding)

37:35.000 --> 37:36.320
(door shuts)

37:38.760 --> 37:40.560
I'm glad she got that part.

37:41.200 --> 37:44.520
-She wanted that part.
-What? Whose side are you on?

37:44.600 --> 37:46.120
I'm on your side.

37:46.200 --> 37:48.720
It's, like, impossible
to be on Rayanne's side,

37:48.800 --> 37:50.600
even though I partly understand it.

37:51.960 --> 37:54.600
-What do you mean?
-I mean, face it.

37:55.560 --> 37:58.280
She's always partly wanted to be you.

37:59.880 --> 38:03.040
In a way, I think this was
her screwed up way of...

38:03.120 --> 38:07.520
for one night, kind of
pretending she was you.

38:08.240 --> 38:10.440
I mean, I'm on your side,
no question.

38:11.920 --> 38:14.040
But can I just
ask you something?

38:16.240 --> 38:20.400
Why are you making this big play
for Corey helfrick...

38:21.800 --> 38:24.400
-when you know how I feel about him?
-But...

38:25.240 --> 38:27.200
Because... 'cause I thought...

38:28.080 --> 38:30.400
you told me you were over him.

38:31.080 --> 38:34.640
But guess how I felt
when you started going after him?

38:38.200 --> 38:39.520
I don't have to guess.

38:46.600 --> 38:48.320
-Hey.
-Hey.

38:48.800 --> 38:52.640
Camille and I went shopping.
I bought you a shirt.

38:52.720 --> 38:54.960
Oh! Thanks.

38:55.880 --> 39:01.640
So I found out why Angela hasn't
been taking Rayanne's phone calls.

39:02.360 --> 39:04.400
She slept with Jordan.

39:05.360 --> 39:07.880
-Angela slept with Jordan?
-No!

39:07.960 --> 39:09.880
Rayanne did.

39:09.960 --> 39:14.520
Oh. Oh, God.
God, that is really low.

39:15.760 --> 39:17.280
Well, but, um...

39:18.000 --> 39:21.880
it's not like Jordan and Angela
were officially together.

39:21.960 --> 39:24.400
-No. That's not the point.
-I know.

39:24.480 --> 39:29.320
What kind of insensitive,
self-centered, you know, uh...

39:29.400 --> 39:31.480
-(Patty sighs)
-...you?

39:33.000 --> 39:37.320
Camille had this crush on this guy,
freshman year in college.

39:37.400 --> 39:42.360
We went out a couple times,
and I had just been dumped.

39:42.440 --> 39:45.080
You're kidding me.
Did Camille know?

39:45.160 --> 39:46.920
No. She found out.

39:47.000 --> 39:50.720
Tracey Kopel had the biggest mouth.
She was really upset.

39:51.320 --> 39:56.520
Eventually, and I don't even know how,
but she forgave me,

39:56.600 --> 39:59.560
and I've always been
really grateful.

39:59.640 --> 40:00.920
That makes five.

40:02.120 --> 40:05.880
You told me you slept
with four guys. Hmm?

40:08.920 --> 40:10.160
So do you like this?

40:10.760 --> 40:14.440
Yeah. I wanted to get you
something for the restaurant.

40:14.520 --> 40:17.040
Who knows
if there'll even be a restaurant.

40:17.120 --> 40:18.120
What do you mean?

40:18.200 --> 40:22.760
I don't know. It's Hallie.
She's always late.

40:22.840 --> 40:26.560
Even if we go to a meeting, she's late
because she stopped somewhere to...

40:28.440 --> 40:33.400
not to mention the fact that she is
physically incapable of parking legally.

40:37.840 --> 40:43.640
I'll tell you, it is enough
to drive a sane person crazy.

40:45.080 --> 40:48.720
-So you two, uh...
-(door shuts, shower running)

40:48.800 --> 40:52.240
-I mean, you fight?
-What difference does it make?

40:52.320 --> 40:53.600
It's not the end of the world.

40:53.680 --> 40:56.480
Thanks for the shirt. I love it.

40:56.560 --> 41:00.280
(water running)

41:00.360 --> 41:03.080
(toilet flushes)

41:03.840 --> 41:05.840
(Graham) Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

41:08.800 --> 41:12.280
(sighs) I can't. I can't go on.

41:13.680 --> 41:16.240
It goes so fast, we don't have time
to look at one another.

41:16.320 --> 41:17.240
Okay.

41:17.840 --> 41:19.000
Okay, okay.

41:20.800 --> 41:23.080
Yeah, yeah, okay.

41:23.960 --> 41:25.480
Oh, gee whiz.

41:26.760 --> 41:28.320
That's going to be just great,
isn't it?

41:29.160 --> 41:33.200
(chuckles) Um, yes, Mrs. Webb,
yes, yes, yes, yes.

41:33.280 --> 41:34.960
Um, wait a second.

41:35.040 --> 41:38.520
Where is, um...
where is Chee Kwan?

41:38.600 --> 41:41.400
She left.
She can't rehearse this late.

41:41.480 --> 41:45.280
Okay. Well, maybe I can speak
to her parents.

41:45.840 --> 41:49.640
Meanwhile... (sighs)
wait. Who's back there?

41:49.720 --> 41:51.400
Angela Chase?

41:52.160 --> 41:54.800
Would you come up here,
read Chee Kwan's part?

41:55.360 --> 41:58.760
-Come on. It's just a stupid play.
-(Rickie) Go ahead.

42:01.000 --> 42:04.520
Thank you. Just, uh...
look on with Abbysinia.

42:05.480 --> 42:10.360
And... Rayanne,
would you come 3 feet down stage?

42:10.440 --> 42:11.520
Which way?

42:11.600 --> 42:14.080
(sighs)
You can remember it like this.

42:14.160 --> 42:18.160
If you keep going down stage,
you're going to fall down.

42:19.600 --> 42:22.240
Oh, oh. And... could you...

42:27.120 --> 42:29.880
(chuckles)
...stop acting, please?

42:30.720 --> 42:33.440
-What?
-Stop acting.

42:33.520 --> 42:37.400
There's really no need for it.
You see, Emily is dead.

42:37.480 --> 42:39.280
Her life is over.

42:39.840 --> 42:44.120
That's a pretty big deal.
I mean, oh, gee whiz,

42:44.200 --> 42:50.560
she is just now realizing how precious
every moment of that life really was,

42:50.640 --> 42:52.960
and that she never fully
appreciated what she had.

42:54.400 --> 42:55.960
Just imagine...

42:57.360 --> 42:59.480
what that must feel like,
Rayanne.

43:11.840 --> 43:16.000
I can't go on. It goes so fast.
We don't have time to look at one another.

43:18.160 --> 43:19.960
I didn't realize...

43:23.600 --> 43:26.960
so all that was going on,
and we never noticed.

43:32.320 --> 43:34.800
(voice breaking) Take me back.

43:36.960 --> 43:39.480
Up the hill to my grave.

43:40.800 --> 43:42.400
But first, wait.

43:44.840 --> 43:46.440
One last look.

43:49.000 --> 43:52.680
Goodbye. Goodbye, world.

43:53.960 --> 43:56.000
Goodbye, grovers corners.

43:57.480 --> 43:59.280
Mama and papa.

44:01.840 --> 44:03.560
Goodbye to clocks ticking.

44:06.840 --> 44:11.200
Do any human beings ever realize
life while they live it?

44:13.480 --> 44:15.480
Every, every minute?

44:18.280 --> 44:21.040
No. Saints and poets, maybe.

44:21.760 --> 44:22.920
They do some.

44:28.240 --> 44:30.160
I'm ready to go back.

44:31.320 --> 44:37.360
(somber music playing)

44:39.360 --> 44:40.880
Were you happy?

44:49.160 --> 44:50.240
No.

44:53.720 --> 44:55.600
I should have listened to you.

44:56.560 --> 44:58.800
But that's all human beings are.

45:03.320 --> 45:05.200
Just blind people.

45:06.640 --> 45:09.080
(somber music playing)

45:20.960 --> 45:23.120
(somber music continues playing)

45:53.800 --> 45:56.240
(theme music playing)
