[Aceveda] 
The police department can change...

01:00.214 --> 01:03.149
but trust me,
it's not gonna happen from the inside.

01:03.250 --> 01:06.219
Well, what's that have to do
with the city council?

01:06.320 --> 01:08.880
These property seizures are targeting
my constituents now, someday, yours too.

01:08.990 --> 01:13.427
- That's not our problem?
- You just started, David. Take a breath.

01:13.527 --> 01:15.825
Give yourself a chance
to get settled in.

01:15.930 --> 01:18.490
[Aceveda] This policy's led
to increased corruption in other cities.

01:18.599 --> 01:23.093
Locals fighting for profits,
rises in police brutality complaints.

01:23.204 --> 01:25.866
- What do you want, exactly?
- A leadership position
on the police committee.

01:25.973 --> 01:29.875
/ can steer policy, protect
the council's interests. Look, Bill.

01:29.977 --> 01:33.538
/ know how it works there.
/ know what needs to be done.

01:33.648 --> 01:35.843
I just need the authority
to do it.

01:35.950 --> 01:38.510
[Bill] That's what the other
councilmen are afraid of.

01:38.619 --> 01:42.555
They think you might try
to shove something down their throat.

01:42.657 --> 01:44.284
That won't happen.

01:44.392 --> 01:47.919
/t's how / can serve best.

01:49.597 --> 01:51.622
/tjust makes sense.

02:00.408 --> 02:02.308
I got it.

02:08.215 --> 02:11.150
Thanks.

02:11.252 --> 02:15.279
- I'm Sara.
- David.

02:15.389 --> 02:17.357
You mind?

02:21.929 --> 02:23.920
Havin' a good time?

02:24.031 --> 02:27.023
Just making an effort
to meet people.

02:27.134 --> 02:29.796
But I don't remember
seeing you in here before.

02:29.904 --> 02:32.668
But your friend looked familiar.

02:32.773 --> 02:35.799
I hope, for his wife's sake,
he wasn't a john.

02:40.314 --> 02:42.339
You're a cop.

02:44.151 --> 02:46.051
I need to get
my radar checked.

02:46.153 --> 02:48.485
How's business?

02:48.589 --> 02:51.387
I don't know
what you're talking about.

02:51.492 --> 02:54.552
Look, I'm just here to have a cigarette,
not to make an arrest.

02:59.533 --> 03:01.899
So where you from?

03:02.002 --> 03:04.664
Phoenix.

03:04.772 --> 03:07.297
- Been here long?
- No.

03:07.408 --> 03:09.569
Just came out.

03:09.677 --> 03:11.577
I like it though.

03:12.913 --> 03:14.904
There's a lot to like.

03:21.088 --> 03:23.613
It's nice to meet you, David.

03:39.006 --> 03:42.134
You been on vacation, or are you
just workin'on white people's time?

03:42.243 --> 03:44.143
Where the hell is Antwon?

03:44.245 --> 03:47.146
Every cop with a Kodak is hasslin'
brothers, seizin' cars and shit.

03:47.248 --> 03:49.443
- Antwon's shit.
- So?

03:49.550 --> 03:52.212
So you best remember why you here.
Antwon ain't posin'for no po-po.

03:52.319 --> 03:55.550
I told you last time.
I don't deal with scrubs.

03:55.656 --> 03:59.683
Andjust so we're clear, /'m the one
that's supposed to be getting tips.

03:59.794 --> 04:04.493
You're a week behind.
So you tell Antwon to come back himself.

04:04.598 --> 04:07.499
- And don't forget to bring me gifts.
- You trippin'? Huh?

04:07.601 --> 04:10.126
Or you forget just how much
you up in for Antwon?

04:10.237 --> 04:13.536
'Cause itjust takes one anonymous call
to 911. You feel me?

04:15.376 --> 04:18.072
- Oh, yeah, I feel you.
- You better figure out
how to stop the bleedin...

04:18.178 --> 04:20.773
or I'm gonna have to drop
a dime on your ass.

04:24.018 --> 04:27.545
One second.
Come here.

04:27.655 --> 04:31.352
We'll work this out.

04:31.458 --> 04:35.053
He's gonna drop a dime?
Are we involved in some shit...

04:35.162 --> 04:37.062
beyond hookers
that I don't know about?

04:37.164 --> 04:39.064
This is just a little
quid pro quo thing...

04:39.166 --> 04:41.066
only Antwon's a little
slow on the quo.

04:41.168 --> 04:45.195
Hey, this is not a big deal. These guys
always try this once to see if they can own you.

04:45.306 --> 04:49.299
As long as we handle this right,
there's not a problem.

04:49.410 --> 04:52.277
So you just sit
on the other guy, okay?

04:52.379 --> 04:55.007
All right? Okay.

04:55.115 --> 04:57.242
I think I might have
come up with something.

04:57.351 --> 04:59.751
- My nigga.
- [Army] Hey! Hey!

04:59.854 --> 05:01.754
Step back, asshole.

05:01.856 --> 05:05.053
[Groaning]

05:05.159 --> 05:09.061
You gonna drop
a dime on us? Huh?

05:10.331 --> 05:12.765
- [Grunting]
- [Groaning]

05:23.911 --> 05:25.902
Whatcha got in here?

05:26.013 --> 05:29.915
Come here.
Hit him.

05:30.017 --> 05:32.679
Do it, asshole!

05:32.786 --> 05:36.517
- No.
- I told you to do something, you dumbshit!

05:42.263 --> 05:46.222
Harder. Harder.

05:46.333 --> 05:48.233
I thought you two were tight.

05:48.335 --> 05:50.303
[Chuckles]

05:52.406 --> 05:57.969
You know what?
Tell Antwon there's a new scoop law.

05:58.078 --> 06:00.672
Come pick up his dog shit.

06:04.018 --> 06:06.316
It's, uh, safer
if we talk out here.

06:06.420 --> 06:08.888
Whatever. Listen,
/ need you to look at a guy.

06:08.989 --> 06:11.480
A drug dealer named
Maurice Webster.

06:11.592 --> 06:13.787
Claudette and I don't
usually handle drug cases.

06:13.894 --> 06:17.091
From what you've been telling me,
it's a step up.

06:17.197 --> 06:20.098
- I should write this down.
- Stop. I'll send over the file.
Get it from your captain.

06:20.200 --> 06:23.727
This is all we have to do to make things
straight with us and the D.A. again?

06:23.837 --> 06:25.737
No. But it's a start.

06:25.839 --> 06:28.774
Now, my source says
that Maurice is a major player.

06:28.876 --> 06:32.107
See what you and
your partner can whip up.

06:32.212 --> 06:34.112
Hey.

06:34.214 --> 06:36.876
Hey, we've gotta go.
The Realtor's inside.

06:36.984 --> 06:38.884
- She's taking her sweet time.
- They're interested.

06:38.986 --> 06:41.352
Gretchen thinks they're
gonna make us an offer.

06:41.455 --> 06:44.686
Why does Mom have to move?

06:44.792 --> 06:48.853
We talked about that, Cassidy.
/ want to.

06:48.963 --> 06:53.627
What about my friends...
when I'm here?

06:54.768 --> 06:56.668
Can / go to my room?

06:56.770 --> 06:59.170
- We have to go while they're here.
- [Cell Phone Ringing]

06:59.273 --> 07:02.572
- Hold on. Yeah.
- [Mouthing Words]

07:02.676 --> 07:05.873
I'll hold.

07:05.980 --> 07:09.416
- All my stuff is in my room.
- No one's gonna touch your things.

07:09.516 --> 07:12.178
[Sighs]
All right, /'ll be there.

07:12.286 --> 07:14.311
I gotta go to work.
Give me a kiss.

07:16.457 --> 07:19.085
[Sighs]
All right, let's get out of their way.

07:26.967 --> 07:29.697
I appreciate the call,
but rape's not usually my thing.

07:29.803 --> 07:32.431
Fugitive recovery is.

07:32.539 --> 07:34.666
Oscar Ruiz was at
the courthouse this morning...

07:34.775 --> 07:37.073
for a prelim on his three
sexual assault charges.

07:37.177 --> 07:39.338
They think he found
an unlocked window.

07:39.446 --> 07:41.346
[Mackey]
Picked the wrong guy to let escape.

07:41.448 --> 07:43.348
They figure he got loose
around 7:30.

07:43.450 --> 07:45.975
We didn't hear about it
until 9:30 after he raped again.

07:46.086 --> 07:49.112
[Man] Myrna, are you there?
You said it was an emergency.

07:49.223 --> 07:51.123
- [Myrna]Joe-
- Yeah? Yeah, what's wrong?

07:51.225 --> 07:53.921
- / slept with him.
- What? What are you talking about?

07:54.028 --> 07:56.895
- / sucked his dick, and then
he did me from behind.
- What the hell's going on?

07:56.997 --> 08:01.866
He's better than you are.
He's a real man, not a pussy like you.

08:01.969 --> 08:04.437
- Myrna- Myrna, is somebody there?
- He's so big.

08:04.538 --> 08:07.473
- Who's there, Myrna?
- He's the best / ever had.

08:07.574 --> 08:09.474
Myrna, is he
making you say this?

08:09.576 --> 08:13.876
/ want him to do it to me
again in the ass... while you listen.

08:13.981 --> 08:16.745
- Myrna, /'m calling the police.
/'m on my way home.
- [Myrna Sobbing]

08:16.850 --> 08:18.841
[Machine Beeps]

08:20.320 --> 08:23.221
Wanna get this guy?

08:23.323 --> 08:25.291
Yeah.

08:25.392 --> 08:29.453
[Rock]

08:29.563 --> 08:31.463
[Men, Women Chattering]

08:31.565 --> 08:34.534
[Ends]

08:36.570 --> 08:39.903
[Dutch] Oscar Ruiz,
the stay-at-home rapist.

08:40.006 --> 08:43.408
Forcing his victims to call the husband
or the boyfriend was his standard M.O.

08:43.510 --> 08:45.535
Puts a neat little spin
on things.

08:45.646 --> 08:47.546
Come for the rape,
stay for the humiliation.

08:47.648 --> 08:50.276
- That's a list of his friends and acquaintances.
- Anyone interesting?

08:50.384 --> 08:52.909
- He's got a fiancÃ©e living in Farmington.
- Talk to her.

08:53.020 --> 08:57.821
So Ruiz left the rape scene at 9:15 with
a handgun and clothes from their closet.

08:57.925 --> 09:00.587
That makes two hours
since anyone's heard from him.

09:00.694 --> 09:02.628
A smart guy would run as far
and as fast as he could.

09:02.729 --> 09:04.663
But he raped again
right out of the box.

09:04.765 --> 09:07.256
Which means he knows we'll catch him.
He's gonna binge until we do.

09:09.636 --> 09:12.799
Ruiz poses as
a flower shop delivery guy.

09:12.906 --> 09:16.000
Then he forces his way in.
I'll get his pictures to the shop owners.

09:16.110 --> 09:18.977
Then I'll talk to his roommate.
"Stay-at-home rapist"?

09:19.079 --> 09:21.047
It's just something I coined.

09:21.148 --> 09:24.140
Well, the women stay at home.
This guy goes out and rapes.

09:24.251 --> 09:26.048
Nicknames are meant
to be catchy, not literal.

09:26.153 --> 09:28.212
You want us to throw in on Ruiz?

09:28.322 --> 09:30.290
[Monica]
No, Vic's got it.

09:34.294 --> 09:38.025
I'm Captain Rawling.
This is Detective Mackey.

09:38.132 --> 09:41.295
- Emily, right?
- Yeah- Emily Mischner.

09:41.401 --> 09:44.859
Thank you for coming in.
I apologize for what happened.

09:44.972 --> 09:48.464
We can put you in a department
safe house until this is resolved.

09:48.575 --> 09:50.475
Until what's resolved?

09:52.012 --> 09:54.310
Why am I here?

09:54.414 --> 09:58.350
Oscar Ruiz escaped
from sheriff! s custody this morning.

09:58.452 --> 10:02.821
Oh, my God. That's what
the commotion at court was about?

10:02.923 --> 10:07.860
We're gonna find him. But
you shouldn't go home alone until we do.

10:07.961 --> 10:12.864
I have been alone. I went home
right after they delayed that hearing.

10:12.966 --> 10:16.595
He already raped me once.
Why didn't somebody here tell me?

10:16.703 --> 10:20.332
The sheriff s department thought they
had him contained in a downtown area.

10:20.440 --> 10:23.466
/t took a couple ofhours before they
realized that he had gotten past them.

10:25.779 --> 10:30.113
- So he's out there?
- We have a lot of resources
dedicated to this thing.

10:30.217 --> 10:33.345
/n the meantime, a couple of officers
could take you home...

10:33.453 --> 10:35.921
and stand guard.

10:36.023 --> 10:40.926
l- I'd, um-
I'd rather stay here...

10:41.028 --> 10:43.292
until you catch him.

10:45.599 --> 10:49.330
Yo. You seen this guy?

10:52.072 --> 10:54.734
- You are Blinky, right?
- In here, I'm Felix. What's goin' on?

10:54.841 --> 10:57.776
Oscar Ruiz, your roommate?

10:57.878 --> 10:59.778
He's in prison.

10:59.880 --> 11:02.280
- He got escaped.
- No shit?

11:02.382 --> 11:05.442
So you don't know that he raped
another woman this morning either?

11:05.552 --> 11:08.715
- What?
- They were about to lay
a life sentence on this prick.

11:08.822 --> 11:11.655
You know what they're gonna do to you
when they find out you helped him escape?

11:11.758 --> 11:13.885
Yo, I didn't help him escape.
All right?

11:13.994 --> 11:17.157
I didn't even know he was out
till he showed up this morning.

11:17.264 --> 11:19.164
When did he get here?

11:19.266 --> 11:21.530
Hey, he was out back
when I got here to work.

11:21.635 --> 11:25.127
Look, he said he was innocent, so / gave
him a few dollars to get to Mexico, and-

11:25.239 --> 11:27.139
l-I just wanted him gone.

11:27.241 --> 11:29.300
He didn't go to Tijuana.
He went out and raped another woman.

11:29.409 --> 11:32.742
He used your money to buy the flowers
that got him in the front door.

11:32.846 --> 11:35.838
Does he know how
to get into your apartment?

11:35.949 --> 11:37.849
He knows where
I keep the spare key.

11:37.951 --> 11:39.976
- Hey, man, I'm sorry.
- Save it.

11:40.087 --> 11:45.081
I'm gonna park your ass right here with
an officer in case Ruiz shows up again.

11:47.094 --> 11:50.689
Antwon Mitchell...

11:50.797 --> 11:53.493
as I live and breathe.

11:53.600 --> 11:55.500
Run on inside, kids.

11:55.602 --> 11:58.571
Man, you got to be crazy
showin'your face around here...

11:58.672 --> 12:01.573
especially after that shit
you pulled last night.

12:01.675 --> 12:04.337
/ didn't wanna play hard,
but your boy was threatening to own us.

12:04.444 --> 12:09.472
The question is,
what's next for us?

12:10.851 --> 12:13.547
Halpern was out of line.

12:13.654 --> 12:15.849
That shit
won't happen again.

12:15.956 --> 12:18.857
That's not good enough, partner.

12:18.959 --> 12:22.793
I don't know if you got a hard-on for jail
or you just like pissin' off cops...

12:22.896 --> 12:28.061
but me and my boy are lookin' at the door
on this unless you convince me otherwise.

12:29.369 --> 12:31.667
Come on.
Shit on 'em, man.

12:34.007 --> 12:37.568
Hey, don't go sideways on me.

12:39.846 --> 12:42.872
Paid in full...

12:42.983 --> 12:45.850
with a little extra
to make everything all right.

12:45.952 --> 12:48.785
Okay, player?

12:48.889 --> 12:51.050
Good.

12:51.158 --> 12:53.058
But I like makin' busts too.

12:53.160 --> 12:56.960
Just step up the tips. I'll make sure
you get by same as before.

12:57.064 --> 12:58.964
Hey, things ain't the same
as before, man.

12:59.066 --> 13:01.694
We got these cops comin'
after us like storm troopers.

13:01.802 --> 13:03.963
Well, I'm your Luke Skywalker.

13:04.071 --> 13:08.064
The seizures-
I'm close to the cop who's runnin' it.

13:09.943 --> 13:11.843
How close you to him?

13:11.945 --> 13:14.812
I'm as close
as I need to be.

13:16.183 --> 13:20.643
- Okay. Get at me then.
- Uh-uh.

13:20.754 --> 13:23.086
You gotta bring me
some news I can use.

13:23.190 --> 13:26.626
Then the clock starts runnin'
on your protection.

13:35.535 --> 13:38.993
- Hey, Captain. Back already?
- City business.

13:41.508 --> 13:44.944
A multiple rapist walked out of the courthouse
this morning, attacked another woman.

13:45.045 --> 13:47.036
- I need to reschedule.
- Anything I can do?

13:47.147 --> 13:49.547
No.
Sorry to inconvenience you.

13:49.649 --> 13:52.209
A lot of people have been talking to me
about these police seizures.

13:52.319 --> 13:55.379
I think we should talk today.
It's important.

13:55.489 --> 13:57.889
- Can you wait a few minutes?
- Yeah, a few.

13:57.991 --> 14:00.960
Beth /nsardi just called. There's a drug dealer
they wanna make a case against.

14:01.061 --> 14:03.222
She specifically asked
for the two of you.

14:03.330 --> 14:05.031
- Really?
- You sure she meant us?
Must be the bottom of the barrel.

14:05.031 --> 14:06.521
- Really?
- You sure she meant us?
Must be the bottom of the barrel.

14:06.633 --> 14:08.760
Doesn't sound it.
His name is Maurice Webster.

14:08.869 --> 14:10.803
He's a big dope fish
in our little pond.

14:10.904 --> 14:14.067
- So try to wrap a net around him.
- [Claudette] Drug sting.

14:14.174 --> 14:17.234
- Isn't that more Vic's rhythm?
- Vic's busy.

14:17.344 --> 14:20.643
So I'd take whatever olive branch
the D.A.'s offering.

14:20.747 --> 14:23.113
Beth says there's a time issue,
so don't waste any.

14:25.619 --> 14:29.487
Maybe they're ready to take
the leash off, huh?

14:29.589 --> 14:33.116
His picture's out there- flower shops,
supermarkets, even the on-ramp slingers.

14:33.226 --> 14:36.059
- [Mackey] Anything on the fiancÃ©e?
- No, nothing.

14:36.163 --> 14:39.257
All right, gather around.
This is Ruiz's old apartment.

14:39.366 --> 14:41.266
We'll start from here
and spread out.

14:41.368 --> 14:44.166
Let's hope he's feeling homesick.
Let's go.

14:46.473 --> 14:49.203
Hey, any luck
on your rapist?

14:49.309 --> 14:52.938
Yeah- all his.
You got something to run by me?

14:53.046 --> 14:56.243
I just found a crack
in Antwon Mitchell's family seal.

14:56.349 --> 14:58.874
His oldest son, Donald ///,
has been movin'fake /.D. 's...

14:58.985 --> 15:01.283
out of the back of his van
in the D.M.V. parking lot.

15:01.388 --> 15:04.050
I thought Antwon kept
all of his kids straight.

15:04.157 --> 15:06.182
This one dumped private school
for the family business.

15:08.128 --> 15:11.791
I, uh- Do me a favor.
Don't move on this punk for a day or two.

15:11.898 --> 15:15.197
- Why not?
- I gotta test a theory.

15:15.302 --> 15:18.066
Someone just spotted Ruiz.
Seventh and Vermont.

15:24.478 --> 15:27.504
So, about the seizures?

15:27.614 --> 15:30.048
I understand coming on strong
in the beginning to set a tone...

15:30.150 --> 15:33.608
but maybe
you're pushing too hard.

15:33.720 --> 15:37.417
- You have a suggestion?
- Reach out to the community.
Visit some churches...

15:37.524 --> 15:39.424
community watch programs.

15:39.526 --> 15:41.517
Put on a friendly face.

15:41.628 --> 15:43.528
If these people don't know you,
they won't trust you.

15:43.630 --> 15:45.621
When they see us pulling
bangers off their corners...

15:45.732 --> 15:47.825
I think they'll give us
a second look.

15:47.934 --> 15:51.233
And what they'll see
is you targeting blacks and Latinos.

15:51.338 --> 15:53.806
That's who's here.
We target the criminals.

15:53.907 --> 15:57.274
Most of their victims are black and Latino.
They're smart enough to know the difference.

15:57.377 --> 15:59.971
I'm not trying to kill it.
Maybe with some modifications...

16:00.080 --> 16:03.516
this plan could be a little more
civilian-friendly, that's all.

16:03.617 --> 16:08.054
- This coming from a councilman
or a police captain?
- Both.

16:08.154 --> 16:10.918
And you should know
there's a chance that...

16:11.024 --> 16:13.686
I could be overseeing these seizures
on the police committee.

16:13.793 --> 16:16.455
We don't answer to
the police committee on this.

16:16.563 --> 16:18.554
- Not yet.
- [Phone Ringing]

16:23.970 --> 16:25.870
- Yeah.
- [Mackey] We just missed him.

16:25.972 --> 16:29.032
- What happened?
- Flower shop owner saw him, called it in.

16:29.142 --> 16:31.042
- We missed him by five minutes.
- What do you need?

16:31.144 --> 16:34.841
As many bodies as you can spare.
/ gotta blanket the area.

16:34.948 --> 16:37.678
Okay. Excuse me.

16:40.320 --> 16:42.982
[Julien]
Raga's who our boss is interested in.

16:43.089 --> 16:45.387
Sees the tag in a dozen places
on her way in to work.

16:45.492 --> 16:47.426
He's the main tagger
for the One-niners.

16:47.527 --> 16:51.793
"Raga Paints." "P" is for "Po Boys,"
"ain't," "S" stands for "shit."

16:51.898 --> 16:54.765
"Po Boys ain't shit."
Cute.

16:54.868 --> 16:57.769
So does this have anything to do
with the, uh, territory being disputed?

16:57.871 --> 17:01.705
This is the front line,
which is why Raga keeps hitting this sign.

17:01.808 --> 17:05.436
Raga just gets the word out. But if we can
get him, we can find who's giving the orders.

17:05.545 --> 17:09.276
Look for hoodies or skullies,
and a backpack to carry the paints.

17:09.382 --> 17:13.182
I've been trying to get you guys onto
taggers for a long time. What changed?

17:13.286 --> 17:17.154
We got a new captain. So what's the chance
of this guy hittin'again tonight?

17:17.257 --> 17:20.282
Sometimes, it's hard to tell if ours is
even dried before they're taggin' over it.

17:20.393 --> 17:22.953
- [Woman On Radio] Possible man down.
- That's us. Thanks.

17:24.230 --> 17:27.097
- Have you looked at his file?
- Glanced at it.

17:27.200 --> 17:31.933
- A 60-year-old drug dealer
that's never been arrested?
- Late bloomer?

17:32.038 --> 17:35.337
- There's a possession charge in '89.
- A citation.

17:35.442 --> 17:38.900
We've got unis staking out a guy
who got a ticket for having a joint.

17:39.012 --> 17:41.879
- Maybe he's careful.
- You said he was a late bloomer.

17:41.982 --> 17:44.007
- The D.A. says he's important.
- Yeah.

17:44.117 --> 17:47.018
- I think they're tryin' to jerk us off.
- They requested us.

17:47.120 --> 17:50.385
Because everybody else
is out huntin' a rapist.

17:50.490 --> 17:54.187
Take yes for an answer?
Please?

17:58.732 --> 18:01.257
Ruiz ran out of here
less than 20 minutes ago.

18:01.368 --> 18:04.496
- Where do you want us?
- Start a couple of blocks up
and work your way north.

18:04.604 --> 18:08.370
- Okay.
- Hey, Vic. Ruiz just called his fiancÃ©e.

18:08.475 --> 18:11.569
- She tipped him the cops were there.
- Tell me we got a trace.

18:18.785 --> 18:21.083
[Man]
They're gonna take care of you.

18:21.187 --> 18:23.087
I need you with me.

18:23.189 --> 18:26.352
I'll be right behind you.
I promise.

18:32.565 --> 18:34.863
- [Yelling, Clattering]
- [Danny] Sir, come on.

18:34.968 --> 18:36.868
- Calm down.
- It's his house.

18:36.970 --> 18:38.870
[Yelling]

18:38.972 --> 18:41.133
[Yelling, Sobbing]

18:53.987 --> 18:56.512
Neighborhood canvass
came up empty.

18:56.623 --> 18:59.592
- He's got family in Fresno.
- Unis are at the train and bus stations.

18:59.693 --> 19:02.457
- What's your next move?
- I'm on the fiancÃ©e and the friend.

19:02.562 --> 19:05.588
And we're gonna expand
the neighborhood search.

19:05.699 --> 19:07.929
Ruiz didn't sling.
He wasn't a member of a gang.

19:08.034 --> 19:09.934
Maybe you should talk to Dutch.

19:10.036 --> 19:13.665
He's a little more plugged in
to this guy's psychology than you are.

19:13.773 --> 19:16.401
[Sighs]
It's time to get creative.

19:18.878 --> 19:20.869
- [Rap]
- [Whistles] Five-O!

19:20.980 --> 19:25.610
Suvuto. How'd you and your thorns
like to play deputy for a day?

19:25.719 --> 19:27.653
God's work
ain't cop's work, homey.

19:27.754 --> 19:29.688
I thinkJesus'll
loan you out for this one.

19:29.789 --> 19:35.091
- [Ronnie] Name's Oscar Ruiz.
- He who persecutes my brother
persecutes me.

19:35.195 --> 19:37.720
Yeah? How about he who rapes
my mother or my sister?

19:37.831 --> 19:41.858
At least five that we know about.
After he's done...

19:41.968 --> 19:45.699
he makes them call their husband or
their boyfriend, tell 'em how good he was.

19:45.805 --> 19:49.104
Ruiz escaped
from your hood this morning.

19:49.209 --> 19:51.109
- We'll check it out.
- Good.

19:51.211 --> 19:54.408
Look for flowers. He poses as
a delivery guy to get in the house.

19:54.514 --> 19:58.280
- All right, homes.
- Someone sees him, I want a call.

19:58.384 --> 20:02.013
Hey. Aren't you gonna
swear us all in?

20:02.122 --> 20:06.115
Blessed is he who delivers
this asshole unto me.

20:11.097 --> 20:14.191
- What do you got, Carl?
- Pulled him over for rolling a stop sign.

20:14.300 --> 20:17.030
- Barely. I mean, come on.
- Hey, somebody tell you to talk?

20:17.137 --> 20:19.401
When he opened the window,
I noticed a strong marijuana odor...

20:19.506 --> 20:21.599
emanating from
inside the vehicle.

20:21.708 --> 20:24.506
- Which gave you probable cause to search.
- Yes, sir.

20:24.611 --> 20:28.172
- We found these.
- Good work, Officers.

20:30.450 --> 20:33.214
Don't you have
anything more important to do?

20:33.319 --> 20:38.052
I'm sorry you don't think buying illegal drugs
is important. Fortunately, the courts do.

20:38.158 --> 20:41.286
Have you heard about the asset seizures
we've been doing around here?

20:41.394 --> 20:44.056
We caught you with illegal drugs.
That means we can take your car.

20:44.164 --> 20:47.065
We find any weed in your house,
you can kiss that good-bye too.

20:47.167 --> 20:49.226
- You can't do that.
- Watch us.

20:49.335 --> 20:52.270
- He's not lying.
- Have you ever been to prison?

20:52.372 --> 20:54.499
- Have you, Slick?
- Of course not.

20:54.607 --> 20:57.337
Forty years old. You really wanna
start down that road now?

20:57.443 --> 21:00.105
Look, it was just a couple
of reefer sticks. Come on.

21:00.213 --> 21:02.238
You've got one chance
to help yourself.

21:02.382 --> 21:06.375
After that, it's out of my hands.
Now who's your dealer?

21:07.787 --> 21:09.846
Maurice. But he's not a dealer.
He's just a friend.

21:09.956 --> 21:12.322
Hooks me up.

21:12.425 --> 21:15.326
Got a few plants in his backyard.
Enough for him and a few others.

21:16.963 --> 21:20.626
- Three plants in his backyard?
- Well, that's just his version.

21:20.733 --> 21:23.099
The D.A.'s office is trying
to make us look like idiots.

21:23.203 --> 21:26.195
- Why would they do that?
- Somebody is lying to somebody.

21:26.306 --> 21:29.332
- Right now, Slick's the only person I believe.
- How was the interview?

21:29.442 --> 21:32.411
Oh, our major drug dealer
is looking a little minor.

21:32.512 --> 21:34.878
Slick's ready to cooperate.

21:34.981 --> 21:37.040
If the D.A.'s willing to pull
you two out of mothballs...

21:37.150 --> 21:39.050
there's plenty
I could use you for.

21:39.152 --> 21:41.052
- Vic talk to you yet?
- No.

21:41.154 --> 21:43.247
He will.

21:44.691 --> 21:48.218
Ooh. Crushing crime
one blunt at a time.

21:54.267 --> 21:56.792
Find what you need?

21:56.903 --> 22:00.805
I've been meeting with people
about staff jobs for my district office.

22:00.907 --> 22:04.843
- / was just checking records.
- Resources are for law enforcement personnel.

22:04.944 --> 22:08.345
Well, I'm a reservist,
so technically I am personnel.

22:08.448 --> 22:10.712
Fell short of your
10-year pension, did ya?

22:10.817 --> 22:12.944
Being a cop
gets in your blood.

22:13.052 --> 22:15.452
So does being a politician
from what I hear.

22:15.555 --> 22:17.921
If I can stay connected to the force
a couple of nights a month...

22:18.024 --> 22:20.458
then I'm happy to serve.

22:21.928 --> 22:24.226
I need some fresh air.

22:26.299 --> 22:30.065
The effectiveness and fairness
of these seizures aside...

22:30.169 --> 22:32.103
you're doing a bad job
selling them.

22:32.205 --> 22:34.105
And you'd like
to be my publicist?

22:34.207 --> 22:37.938
Forcing property forfeitures and asset seizures
on a community that's already decimated?

22:38.044 --> 22:40.376
That's the current spin.

22:40.480 --> 22:44.109
If this is about council getting a cut
of seized property, it's not my area.

22:44.217 --> 22:46.549
I'm just making
a suggestion.

22:46.653 --> 22:49.986
I've been where you are, and
I've learned there's always a compromise.

22:50.089 --> 22:53.581
The policy
still needs time to breathe.

22:53.693 --> 22:55.593
If I set up
a public forum...

22:55.695 --> 22:59.028
where you can present your plan,
answer questions, will you come?

23:00.867 --> 23:03.131
Sure.

23:07.807 --> 23:10.275
You want a tip?
Well, I got one for you.

23:10.376 --> 23:13.243
Heard about some eses
runnin' some wetbacks over the border.

23:13.346 --> 23:16.338
I can eat lunch downtown, trip over
one or two on my way in the door.

23:16.449 --> 23:20.579
Shit. My mom's got half a dozen
sleepin'in the back room any given night.

23:20.687 --> 23:23.781
Yeah, well, these Mexicans,
they check in, they don't check out.

23:23.890 --> 23:26.484
What does that mean?

23:26.592 --> 23:31.996
They gotta find a family member
willing to pay a five grand relocation fee.

23:33.333 --> 23:35.733
I got some credit now?

23:35.835 --> 23:38.133
Yeah...

23:38.237 --> 23:40.933
if the check clears.

23:45.044 --> 23:49.208
Hey!
I heard about that rapist.

23:49.315 --> 23:51.749
- Think you're close?
- I could use a break.

23:51.851 --> 23:54.718
- What are you into?
- Got a line on a coyote farm.

23:54.821 --> 23:56.914
We're gettin' ready to move.
Thought you might wanna hop on.

23:57.023 --> 23:59.321
I could use a break,
not charity.

23:59.425 --> 24:02.917
Peace offering, that's all.

24:03.029 --> 24:07.227
You remember Shane Vendrell. He's got
something brewin' in our backyard.

24:07.333 --> 24:10.393
Got word on a coyote farm,
hopin' maybe you could give us some backup.

24:10.503 --> 24:14.303
- They're housing illegal aliens?
- Until the family can pay to spring 'em.

24:14.407 --> 24:17.706
Just when they think they're free and clear,
boom, the final bill comes due.

24:17.810 --> 24:20.142
All my officers
are tied up chasing Ruiz.

24:20.246 --> 24:22.680
- So I guess we're on our own.
- Let me, uh-

24:22.782 --> 24:24.943
Let me know when you're in position,
see what I can spare.

24:25.051 --> 24:27.315
Thank you.

24:27.420 --> 24:31.914
- Uh, so how's the hunt?
- I got some things worth looking into.

24:32.025 --> 24:33.925
Well, look what the rat dragged in.

24:35.795 --> 24:39.492
Uh- He's got a line on somethin'.

24:39.599 --> 24:44.935
Some One-niner droppin'
stolen air bags at a garage on Third.

24:45.038 --> 24:47.768
Think I'll cut out the back.

24:57.083 --> 25:00.849
- So, what's going on with Webster?
- You tell me.

25:00.953 --> 25:03.148
Are you saying
you don't have anything yet?

25:03.256 --> 25:06.692
No. We hear he's got three
marijuana plants in his backyard.

25:06.793 --> 25:09.284
Oh, well,
three is enough for us.

25:09.395 --> 25:11.295
You said he was
a major drug dealer.

25:11.397 --> 25:13.865
- He's selling drugs, isn't he?
- What aren't you telling me?

25:13.966 --> 25:16.764
I'm not gonna push this
any further.

25:18.471 --> 25:22.498
Webster's about to testify
for the defense in a murder trial...

25:22.608 --> 25:25.076
and we'd like to
undermine his credibility.

25:25.178 --> 25:29.342
You had us target a guy
to keep him off the witness stand?

25:29.449 --> 25:31.349
That's bullshit!

25:31.451 --> 25:33.851
You wanted out of the doghouse, remember?
You came to me.

25:33.953 --> 25:36.353
And you knew if you laid it out for me,
I wouldn't go for it.

25:36.456 --> 25:38.356
- It's not illegal.
- What? Just immoral?

25:38.458 --> 25:41.689
- Not the way I see things.
- My partner doesn't like the smell of it.

25:41.794 --> 25:44.558
Well, fortunately,
you promised to keep her under control.

25:44.664 --> 25:48.156
But if you don't like the way
the deal is anymore...

25:48.267 --> 25:50.758
we can go back
to the way things were.

25:57.243 --> 25:59.837
- So you'll go under with Slick, right?
- Do me a favor.

25:59.946 --> 26:02.005
- Get somebody else.
- It's our case.

26:02.115 --> 26:06.108
- Well, I'd rather not.
- Well, that's great.

26:06.219 --> 26:08.119
That's fantastic.

26:08.221 --> 26:11.122
Hey. Hey, don't you
walk away from me...

26:11.224 --> 26:15.854
not after /'ve had your back
every day for the last six months.

26:20.733 --> 26:22.701
Look.

26:24.937 --> 26:27.462
This is our way
to get back into the rotation.

26:27.573 --> 26:31.976
He'll never buy me in this world.
It has to be you.

26:33.613 --> 26:38.846
- [Yelling, Shouting]
- Get on the sidewalk, now!

26:38.951 --> 26:41.078
[Julien]
Back off! Hey.

26:41.187 --> 26:43.280
Drop it!

26:43.389 --> 26:47.086
- [Mackey] Holy shit.
- [Honking Horn]

26:47.193 --> 26:49.218
Back off!

26:49.328 --> 26:52.229
They think it's the guy.
They just started chasing him. He called 911.

26:52.331 --> 26:54.697
Hey, hey, back off!

26:54.800 --> 26:57.064
Back off!

26:57.170 --> 27:01.163
He's not the rapist!
He's Chinese, for Christ's sake!

27:01.274 --> 27:02.832
[Siren Wailing]

27:02.942 --> 27:04.933
What's wrong with you people?

27:07.680 --> 27:10.649
Hey, what happened
to callin'me first?

27:10.750 --> 27:12.650
They thought they got him.
They got excited.

27:12.752 --> 27:15.346
If he's a Chinaman
driving an actual floral truck...

27:15.454 --> 27:19.891
then feel free to assume
he's not our escaped, Hispanic rapist!

27:19.992 --> 27:22.187
Hey, all you said
was flowers, man.

27:22.295 --> 27:24.957
I asked for eyes on the street,
not a lynch mob.

27:25.064 --> 27:29.262
And trust me, you find him,
he won't enjoy the process.

27:29.368 --> 27:31.359
For Christ's sake!

27:31.470 --> 27:33.836
What happened?

27:33.940 --> 27:36.534
Ah, runnin' down Ruiz
has everyone a little on edge.

27:36.642 --> 27:40.305
On edge? You put
a street gang on payroll?

27:40.413 --> 27:45.112
Look, I was just goin' for intel. These guys
follow the messiah, not Suge Knight.

27:45.218 --> 27:47.118
We're lucky
they didn't kill him.

27:47.220 --> 27:51.350
/t's under control.
/ got the genie back in the bottle.

27:51.457 --> 27:53.891
Maybe you should've asked the genie
for three wishes. About as realistic...

27:53.993 --> 27:56.427
as expecting a street gang
to do your policing for you.

27:56.529 --> 27:58.997
- Yeah, I get it.
- Are you gonna burn me, Vic?

27:59.098 --> 28:01.862
No. I'm gonna catch this guy.

28:01.968 --> 28:04.664
A lot of people warned me about using you.
Maybe I should've listened.

28:04.804 --> 28:10.208
You told me to get creative.
That doesn't always go smoothly.

28:10.309 --> 28:14.541
She's been sitting there all day
because she's afraid to go home.

28:14.647 --> 28:17.207
Talk to Dutch?

28:30.463 --> 28:32.363
Enjoy the show?

28:32.465 --> 28:35.866
Deputizing vigilantes.
I gotta write that one down.

28:35.968 --> 28:39.734
Yeah, well, the point is to find
this prick before he rapes again...

28:39.839 --> 28:42.364
which is the only reason
I'd ask your opinion.

28:44.243 --> 28:46.177
- Shoot.
- Ruiz had a roommate.

28:46.279 --> 28:49.146
- He got a hundred bucks off of him.
- Worked once, it can work twice.

28:49.248 --> 28:52.411
I'm on him.
You know about the fiancÃ©e.

28:52.518 --> 28:55.214
- No family in town.
- You watchin' the border?

28:55.321 --> 28:57.221
I got the street stuff covered.

28:57.323 --> 29:02.022
I need you to drop some profile bullshit
on me, preferably something useful.

29:04.830 --> 29:07.094
He used to rape once
every two or three months.

29:07.199 --> 29:10.760
- He's raped twice today already.
As I predicted, he's bingeing.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

29:10.870 --> 29:14.306
- You're a genius.
- What else does he binge on?

29:14.407 --> 29:16.932
At the end of the day
these guys are all loners...

29:17.043 --> 29:18.943
and loners become
creatures of habit.

29:19.045 --> 29:21.878
They have to.
Prison's forced deprivation.

29:21.981 --> 29:26.008
Now he can indulge.
So what else does he like besides raping?

29:26.118 --> 29:29.485
Kicking soccer balls, watching
video games, the same porn movie?

29:29.588 --> 29:33.319
Whatever it is,
he's been missing it.

29:35.528 --> 29:37.792
You're welcome, asshole.

29:39.031 --> 29:41.522
[Jazz]

29:41.634 --> 29:46.128
So, uh, Slick says your mama's ill?

29:46.238 --> 29:50.174
I swear I don't know which is worse,
the chemo or the cancer.

29:50.276 --> 29:54.235
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- Weed's the only thing that seems to help.

29:58.751 --> 30:00.912
Wait right here, Claudette.

30:16.435 --> 30:19.336
It's not chronic,
but it is fire.

30:22.641 --> 30:26.441
[Sniffs]
Ahh.

30:26.545 --> 30:31.539
/t's usually $20 a bag, but
the second one for your mama is gratis.

30:31.650 --> 30:34.676
Hey, thanks, man.
That's great of you.

30:34.787 --> 30:36.550
Yeah. God bless.

30:38.457 --> 30:41.858
- I talked to you at the Continental.
- [Sara] I remember.

30:41.961 --> 30:44.088
How did you get
my home number?

30:44.196 --> 30:45.823
I can get any number
I want.

30:45.931 --> 30:49.492
- Look, I'm gonna hang up.
- No, please don't.

30:49.602 --> 30:52.628
I'm interested
in getting together.

30:52.738 --> 30:55.229
But I need to be more careful
than most people.

30:57.643 --> 31:01.170
- There's some precautions we need to take.
- All right.

31:01.280 --> 31:06.377
Why don't you come over to my place
tonight, and we'll talk about them.

31:06.485 --> 31:08.510
Okay.

31:12.024 --> 31:15.391
What did Ruiz like to do
before he went away?

31:15.494 --> 31:18.361
- I don't know.
- Where did he spend his time?

31:18.464 --> 31:20.728
- In his room.
- Doin' what?

31:20.833 --> 31:25.896
- I didn't even wanna know.
- Hey, you know what? I got this. Get out of here.

31:27.973 --> 31:30.965
[Door Closes]

31:32.645 --> 31:35.944
This guy did somethin'
besides raping all day.

31:36.048 --> 31:41.315
- What was it?
- He'd get his takeout and close
his door all day every day.

31:41.420 --> 31:44.014
What kind of takeout?

31:44.123 --> 31:46.284
Chicken pot pie, man.

31:46.392 --> 31:50.522
Same thing, same place.
The chicken pot pie at Clucky's.

31:51.797 --> 31:54.231
Clucky's.

31:54.333 --> 31:56.233
Good.

31:56.335 --> 31:58.633
- I just waited on him.
- This guy?

31:58.737 --> 32:00.671
An hour ago.
Did he do something wrong?

32:00.773 --> 32:03.537
- Did you talk to him?
- Of course. I live off tips.

32:03.642 --> 32:06.008
He seemed nice. He was lookin' for a car.
Asked me what I drove.

32:06.111 --> 32:09.638
He asked me out too,
but I told him I had a fiancÃ©.

32:12.685 --> 32:14.585
- Jimmied.
- Where's your registration?

32:14.687 --> 32:16.655
Glove compartment.

32:21.160 --> 32:25.187
- Well, that's funny.
- Not really.

32:25.297 --> 32:27.857
[Rock]

32:48.521 --> 32:51.888
Vic!
He's off for the street!

32:51.991 --> 32:53.959
[Continues]

33:01.066 --> 33:03.364
Police!

33:05.037 --> 33:06.937
Stay with him.

33:09.208 --> 33:11.108
Stop!

33:11.210 --> 33:13.610
- [Siren Chirping]
- [Tires Screeching]

33:16.215 --> 33:18.115
[Grunts]

33:18.217 --> 33:21.550
- Come! Come!
- Come on! He's close!

33:21.654 --> 33:23.849
[Barking]

33:23.956 --> 33:25.981
[Shouts In Spanish]

33:33.132 --> 33:36.499
[Barking]

33:36.602 --> 33:39.594
- Send him!
- Take him!

33:39.705 --> 33:42.970
- [Barking, Snarling]
- [Ruiz Screaming]

33:43.075 --> 33:45.066
- Should I call him back?
- Not yet.

33:45.177 --> 33:47.668
Ruiz, throw out your gun.

33:47.780 --> 33:50.248
- [Ruiz Shouting, /ndistinct]
- Throw out your gun right now!

33:50.349 --> 33:53.785
- He lost the gun.
- Call the dog back?

33:54.887 --> 33:58.789
This guy raped five women,
two today.

33:58.891 --> 34:01.291
Yeah.
He might still be packin

34:01.393 --> 34:04.123
- [Ruiz Screaming] Get him off of me.
- [Barking, Snarling]

34:04.229 --> 34:08.029
Get off of me.
[Screaming]

34:14.172 --> 34:16.072
[Screaming, Snarling Continue]

34:16.175 --> 34:20.271
- Okay. Sounds like he's ready to give up.
- [Shouts In Spanish]

34:25.284 --> 34:27.252
Emily?

34:28.887 --> 34:32.219
- Yeah?
- We got him.

34:32.324 --> 34:36.260
One of our officers
can take you home now.

34:36.362 --> 34:39.297
- Is he in jail?
- He's in the hospital.

34:39.398 --> 34:43.027
They used a police dog
to subdue him.

34:43.135 --> 34:45.034
Ruptured one of
his testicles.

34:47.806 --> 34:50.741
They say dogs are
a good judge of character.

34:54.813 --> 34:57.110
[Whispering]
It's okay.

34:59.918 --> 35:03.217
Hey, that was
a nice tip today.

35:03.322 --> 35:06.849
Rescued over 80 illegals,
made six arrests.

35:06.959 --> 35:10.656
- That worked out real good.
- No doubt.

35:10.763 --> 35:11.997
Look, /'m not unreasonable. You work
with me, /'m gonna work with you.

35:11.997 --> 35:16.229
Look, /'m not unreasonable. You work
with me, /'m gonna work with you.

35:16.335 --> 35:18.895
Keep both our asses
in the clear.

35:19.004 --> 35:23.202
It's good to give,
but it's nice to receive.

35:27.446 --> 35:30.472
Mackey's got his eye
on this garage on Third...

35:30.582 --> 35:35.042
droppin', uh,
stolen air bags or somethin'.

35:35.154 --> 35:37.179
Yeah, okay.

35:37.289 --> 35:40.952
But the seizure thing, man-
How's that gonna play out?

35:41.060 --> 35:43.290
I'm workin' on
gettin' close for you.

35:43.395 --> 35:45.488
- Good lookin
- I told you.

35:45.597 --> 35:49.431
This could be a beginning thing.

35:49.535 --> 35:51.628
If the check clears.

35:56.608 --> 36:00.738
Man, / don't make trouble.

36:00.846 --> 36:02.677
I don't hurt anybody.

36:02.781 --> 36:05.773
I don't sell to kids.

36:05.884 --> 36:08.148
I keep to myself.

36:10.122 --> 36:12.022
But y'all act like
/'m out there...

36:12.124 --> 36:14.092
killin' people.

36:15.994 --> 36:20.328
I was lookin' out
for your mama, wasn't I?

36:20.432 --> 36:23.299
Now y'all wanna
lock me up...

36:23.402 --> 36:25.461
for three plants.

36:26.638 --> 36:28.538
That ain't right.

36:28.640 --> 36:31.438
[Knocking]

36:31.543 --> 36:34.774
Can I talk to you outside?

36:38.617 --> 36:41.609
Beth is gonna
take over from here.

36:41.720 --> 36:44.018
He's all yours.

36:54.733 --> 36:56.667
- What happened?
- Went by the tire store.

36:56.769 --> 36:59.897
The air bag guy definitely
pulled up stakes and moved on.

37:00.005 --> 37:02.838
Shane tipped them off.

37:02.941 --> 37:05.876
All right. The good news
is we know about it.

37:05.978 --> 37:09.505
So from now on,
watch what you say around him.

37:09.615 --> 37:13.016
- You're a part of this now.
- I got a choice?

37:17.156 --> 37:21.855
- All right, what do I gotta do?
- Shane thinks he knows all our moves.

37:21.960 --> 37:24.258
So let's throw him a curveball.

37:24.363 --> 37:27.560
Pick up Antwon's kid.
Let's let this guy feel the heat.

37:27.666 --> 37:30.226
Which guy, Antwon or Shane?

37:30.335 --> 37:32.997
Both.

37:33.138 --> 37:35.197
[Pop]

37:35.307 --> 37:37.935
You can smoke
if you like.

37:38.043 --> 37:40.273
I might.

37:44.183 --> 37:46.151
/'m glad you wanted
to see me.

37:50.956 --> 37:52.856
I need to work
some things out.

37:52.958 --> 37:54.823
Me too.

37:54.927 --> 37:58.829
/ need you to proposition me,
so / know /'m safe.

38:01.967 --> 38:06.734
I, uh, wanna be with you...

38:06.839 --> 38:09.171
sexually.

38:09.274 --> 38:12.607
I'll pay you.
Just tell me how much.

38:14.613 --> 38:19.175
You're different, David.
I can tell.

38:21.520 --> 38:23.420
/ like you.

38:25.991 --> 38:30.121
Next time, you should bring me a gift
to show me that you like me too.

38:30.229 --> 38:32.925
Anything you want,
but nice.

38:33.031 --> 38:34.794
Six hundred dollars' worth.

38:34.900 --> 38:37.368
/ can't wait to see
what you pick out.

38:42.174 --> 38:44.665
- What are you doing?
- I'm undressing you.

38:44.776 --> 38:47.438
Ow.

38:47.546 --> 38:49.980
- I'll undress you.
- Okay.

38:50.082 --> 38:52.050
That hurts.

39:05.597 --> 39:07.497
You can slap...

39:07.599 --> 39:10.591
but you can't
leave bruises...

39:10.702 --> 39:13.569
anywhere.

39:13.672 --> 39:17.199
No scratching,
and absolutely no blood.

39:17.309 --> 39:20.767
You can pull hair
as long as you don't pull it out...

39:20.879 --> 39:23.473
and you can choke
if it doesn't hurt too much.

39:27.052 --> 39:31.682
/'ll show you a safe signal
in case / think it's going too far.

39:45.971 --> 39:48.701
Didn't we see her before?

39:50.375 --> 39:52.536
Raga's a girl.

40:03.689 --> 40:05.589
Let me see your hands.

40:07.726 --> 40:11.218
Sorry to ruin
your masterpiece.

40:11.330 --> 40:16.859
[Julien] Not worth it. Just come down
the way you went up. Come on.

40:16.969 --> 40:20.905
You've cost this city tens
of thousands of dollars in cleanup.

40:21.006 --> 40:23.531
- Send me the bill.
- We will.

40:23.642 --> 40:28.079
But you tell me who's planning
this war with the Po Boys...

40:28.180 --> 40:32.446
who's giving you these messages,
I can make things better.

40:34.186 --> 40:36.984
Bring her something to eat
while she thinks it over.

40:37.089 --> 40:40.490
- Hamburger and fries.
- Settle a bet first.

40:40.592 --> 40:44.289
What's "Raga" stand for?

40:44.396 --> 40:48.833
"Righteous Angel, Gorgeous Ass."

40:48.934 --> 40:51.402
I don't admire the artwork...

40:51.503 --> 40:53.937
but I gotta admire
the confidence.

40:54.072 --> 40:57.667
- So how's Pops?
- [Mutters] / don't know.

40:57.776 --> 41:00.506
If he's King Asshole,
that make you prince?

41:00.612 --> 41:02.443
I get some juice
on the street...

41:02.547 --> 41:04.708
but I get problems too.

41:04.816 --> 41:07.250
A lot of guys wanna take me down
for bein'his blood.

41:07.352 --> 41:11.618
Hell yeah. You're walkin' around
with a bull's-eye on your chest.

41:11.723 --> 41:14.886
And where's Antwon?
Oh, yeah, that's right.

41:14.993 --> 41:17.393
He's got 10 other kids
to look in on.

41:17.496 --> 41:19.396
/ hardly know the cat.

41:19.498 --> 41:22.558
Just hear the lectures about me
going on the straight and narrow.

41:22.667 --> 41:25.329
He should take
his own advice, right?

41:27.272 --> 41:29.206
I got an idea
how to get him back...

41:29.307 --> 41:32.504
for all those sad
Christmas mornings.

41:32.611 --> 41:36.274
Back up, man.
I don't like the dude...

41:36.381 --> 41:39.782
but I ain't gonna help the
white occupation take him down either.

41:43.422 --> 41:46.585
Look, I heard about the garage.
I passed on the info.

41:46.691 --> 41:48.591
But I'm not gonna
guarantee these things.

41:48.693 --> 41:50.661
Look, I don't give a shit
about that garage.

41:50.762 --> 41:54.220
- Then what in the hell is your problem?
- They busted my son.

41:55.534 --> 41:58.697
You hear about that?
Huh?

41:58.804 --> 42:01.671
They come around here
lookin' for help when they want it.

42:01.773 --> 42:03.798
And then they go
and bust my son?

42:03.909 --> 42:08.278
They bust my kid, man!
You think that shit is just bad luck?

42:09.881 --> 42:11.781
I'll find out what I can.

42:11.883 --> 42:15.410
They're comin' to get me through my blood,
man. That's what this shit is about.

42:15.520 --> 42:17.420
He said he'd look into it.

42:17.522 --> 42:20.184
Well, get it looked into.
'Cause that's what you're here for.

42:20.292 --> 42:22.192
You're startin'to sound
a lot like Halpern.

42:22.294 --> 42:26.025
Maybe you're thinking about
droppin' a dime too.

42:31.403 --> 42:34.065
It's cool, brother.

42:34.172 --> 42:37.107
It's cool.

42:37.209 --> 42:39.939
- [Sighs]
- But I thought you said you were
close to the seizures dude.

42:40.045 --> 42:43.208
- I will be.
- Right.

42:44.749 --> 42:48.310
Then I'm waitin' on you,
white shadow.

42:50.522 --> 42:53.855
You've been holdin'my daughter
all night for a little graffiti?

42:53.959 --> 42:56.792
Your daughter tags for one of
the most violent gangs in the city.

42:56.895 --> 42:58.863
Not my daughter.

43:01.266 --> 43:03.234
Hi, Mom.

43:03.335 --> 43:06.270
So where should we
send the bill?

43:06.371 --> 43:08.339
[Rock]

43:10.642 --> 43:13.577
- Still workin' the garage sting.
- [Door Closes]

43:13.678 --> 43:15.669
Love that.

43:18.917 --> 43:22.045
- So I want back in.
- Really?

43:22.154 --> 43:25.851
Yeah, you're right. With this new captain,
Farm's where the action is.

43:25.957 --> 43:28.289
But I'll need Army too.
We come as a package.

43:28.393 --> 43:31.954
/ can't promise anything,
but /'ll grease the wheels.

43:32.063 --> 43:36.090
Thanks. With that being said,
things are gonna be different now, right?

43:36.201 --> 43:41.366
I'll report to you, but I answer to her
just like we talked about.

43:45.944 --> 43:48.310
I could probably
make that work.

43:55.887 --> 43:58.412
[Door Closes]

44:02.594 --> 44:06.792
Beth /nsardi just called. The D.A. wants
the two of you on a fresh double murder.

44:06.898 --> 44:08.832
Great.
Where are the bodies?

44:08.934 --> 44:11.664
/s the D.A. 's office
assigning cases now?

44:11.770 --> 44:14.739
- I expected a smile or two.
- What did we do to deserve this promotion?

44:14.839 --> 44:17.433
I don't catch your meaning.

44:17.542 --> 44:19.442
Exactly whose agenda
were we servicing...

44:19.544 --> 44:21.944
by targeting and rolling
a three-plant drug kingpin?

44:23.648 --> 44:25.912
- I'm not aware of any agenda.
- Right.

44:26.017 --> 44:29.248
Shane Vendrell?

44:29.354 --> 44:31.549
- The guy who rolled those coyotes.
- Yeah.

44:31.656 --> 44:34.216
/ know we're taking on new personnel.
Truth is...

44:34.326 --> 44:38.524
I could really use someone like him
workin' the drug angle with these gangs.

44:38.630 --> 44:41.030
He made a nice bust today,
but l-

44:41.132 --> 44:43.862
I don't know him very well
other than what's on paper.

44:43.969 --> 44:45.869
A lot of that's bad.

44:45.971 --> 44:49.270
Aceveda hated Shane as much as he hates me.
That's what that is.

44:49.374 --> 44:51.968
Didn't the two of you have
some problems bigger than Aceveda?

44:52.077 --> 44:56.605
- Well, brothers fight. Who do you trust more?
- So you're vouching for him?

44:58.250 --> 45:00.844
Yeah.
He's a great cop.

45:04.689 --> 45:07.419
Okay.

45:07.525 --> 45:10.722
