WHAT HAPPENED? DID YOU CLOSE?

13:45.783 --> 13:48.946

JUST A HOTEL.

13:49.037 --> 13:50.948
THIS IS THE NEW BRUNSWICK?

13:51.039 --> 13:53.952
YES, SIR.

13:54.042 --> 13:56.750

2O YEARS HAVE GONE BY.

14:19.067 --> 14:21.024
EVERYTHING'S DIFFERENT.

14:21.110 --> 14:24.102
I THINK YOU'RE JUST <i>LOOKING</i>
AT THINGS FOR THE FIRST TIME.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.609
I'VE LIVED NEAR TIMES SQUARE
NEARLY ALL MY LIFE,

14:26.699 --> 14:30.192
BUT I DON'T REMEMBER
SEEING IT, REALLY, FOR YEARS.

14:30.286 --> 14:32.903
THEY COULD'VE PUT UP
HALF A DOZEN NEW BUILDINGS--

14:32.997 --> 14:35.409
I'D NEVER NOTICE
BECAUSE I JUST DON'T LOOK.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.491
YEAH, THAT'S PROBABLY IT.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.944
I BOUGHT THIS PLACE
FROM GERALD BUTLER,

15:56.038 --> 15:57.824
AND I'VE GOT THE DEED
TO PROVE IT.

15:57.915 --> 16:01.078
I DON'T KNOW A MILDRED,
AND I DON'T KNOW YOU, EITHER.

16:01.169 --> 16:03.957
NOW, YOU GET OFF MY PROPERTY,
OR I'LL CALL THE SHERIFF!

17:22.875 --> 17:24.912
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
COME ON, ALAN.

17:27.588 --> 17:29.579
I HAD LUNCH WITH
AGATHA COOK A WEEK AGO,

17:29.674 --> 17:31.790
JUST BEFORE
I LEFT FOR NEW YORK.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.046
I KNOW YOU DID.
YOU MENTIONED IT.

17:34.136 --> 17:37.379
JESS, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON...

17:37.431 --> 17:39.217
BUT I'M GONNA FIND OUT.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.611
WELL, THAT'S IT.
THAT'S WHERE I WORK.

17:57.702 --> 18:01.411
THE UNIVERSITY OF COEURVILLE,
ESTABLISHED 1912.

18:01.497 --> 18:04.330
OVER THERE-- THAT FOUR-STORY
BUILDING- YOU SEE IT?

18:04.417 --> 18:07.626
MY OFFICE
IS ON THE SECOND FLOOR.

18:07.712 --> 18:10.204
WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF IT?

18:10.298 --> 18:13.632
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK.
- WELL, MAYBE THEY MOVED IT.

18:13.718 --> 18:16.005
SURE. SINCE I'VE BEEN GONE,
THEY TOOK IT APART

18:16.095 --> 18:18.632
BRICK BY BRICK
AND MOVED IT SOMEWHERE ELSE.

18:18.723 --> 18:21.431
I'VE MADE THIS DRIVE
TWICE A DAY FOR OVER TEN YEARS.

18:21.517 --> 18:24.851
YOU'D THINK I'D FORGET?!

18:24.937 --> 18:26.143
I'M SORRY.

18:28.524 --> 18:29.935
IT'S OKAY.

18:48.753 --> 18:51.040
DID YOU GET EVERYTHING
ALL STRAIGHTENED OUT?

18:51.130 --> 18:52.495
SURE. I'M OUT OF MY MIND.

18:52.590 --> 18:54.456
OH, ALAN...

18:54.550 --> 18:56.416
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO THINK.
WHAT ELSE CAN I THINK?

18:56.510 --> 18:58.922
SOMEBODY I NEVER SAW BEFORE
LIVING IN MY HOUSE?

18:59.013 --> 19:01.596
VVOMAN I HAD LUNCH VVITH A VVEEK AGO DEAD
THREE YEARS? NEVV BUILDINGS IN THE TOVVN?

19:04.977 --> 19:08.891
THIS IS GOING TO SOUND CRAZY,
BUT DO YOU REMEMBER

19:08.981 --> 19:12.690
WHAT YOU SAID WHEN WE TRIED
TO GET COFFEE AT THE HOTEL?

19:12.777 --> 19:15.269
THE ONE THAT DIDN'T <i>HAVE</i>
THE COFFEE SHOP?

19:15.363 --> 19:19.322
YOU SAID IT WAS AS THOUGH
COEURVILLE HAD AGED 2O YEARS.

19:19.408 --> 19:22.446
- DO YOU REMEMBER?
- TWENTY YEARS IN A WEEK?

19:22.536 --> 19:24.698
WELL, MAYBE NOT IN ONE WEEK.

19:24.789 --> 19:26.826
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

19:26.916 --> 19:31.706
I'M NOT SURE.

19:31.796 --> 19:34.083
BUT WHAT IF IT'S TRUE?

19:34.173 --> 19:38.337
WHAT IF 2O YEARS <i>HA VE</i> GONE BY?

19:38.386 --> 19:40.127
I'M RIP VAN WINKLE?

19:40.221 --> 19:42.929
WELL, WHY NOT?

19:43.015 --> 19:47.134
- IT'S A POSSIBILITY, ISN'T IT?
- NO, I THOUGHT ABOUT THAT.

19:47.228 --> 19:49.515
THAT DOESN'T HOLD UP
FOR A LOT OF REASONS.

19:49.605 --> 19:51.812
FOR ONE THING, IT VVOULD MAKE
ME AT LEAST 45 YEARS OLD,

19:51.899 --> 19:54.516
UNLESS I LEFT TOVVN VVHEN I
VVAS 10, AND THAT COULDN'T BE

19:54.610 --> 19:58.103
BECAUSE I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL
AND COLLEGE HERE!

19:58.197 --> 20:00.234
EXCEPT THERE AREN'T
ANY RECORDS SHOWING

20:00.324 --> 20:02.156
I EVER WENT TO COEURVILLE HIGH.

20:02.243 --> 20:04.735
AND THE UNIVERSITY I WORK FOR,
DEAR OLD COEURVILLE U.,

20:04.829 --> 20:08.322
DOESN'T EVEN EXIST!
IT NEVER EXISTED!

20:08.416 --> 20:09.451
WELL...

20:11.836 --> 20:14.123
WHAT ABOUT YOUR AUNT?

20:14.213 --> 20:17.331
I JUST CHECKED.
THERE'S NOT A TRACE OF EVIDENCE

20:17.425 --> 20:19.712
THAT A MILDRED TALBOT
EVER <i>LIVED</i> HERE.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.669
IT WAS AN IDEA.

20:25.641 --> 20:27.382
COME ON.

20:27.435 --> 20:29.426
- WHERE TO NOW?
- THE CEMETERY.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.366
ALAN, WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

20:53.461 --> 20:56.374
TO FIND OUT
IF THE WORLD'S GONE CRAZY...

20:56.464 --> 20:59.001
OR IF I HAVE.

20:59.091 --> 21:01.378
MY PARENTS ARE BURIED HERE.

21:01.469 --> 21:03.927
IF I CAN JUST
FIND THEIR GRAVES...

21:14.899 --> 21:16.856
OVER THERE--

21:16.942 --> 21:19.809
THE TALBOTS HAVE BEEN BURIED
IN THAT PLOT FOR OVER 5O YEARS.

21:39.632 --> 21:41.043
[9F0aning]: OH!

21:41.133 --> 21:42.419
THOSE THE ONES?

21:42.510 --> 21:44.342
THAT'S THEM, ALL RIGHT.

21:44.428 --> 21:46.294
I'M SORRY.

21:55.314 --> 21:57.931
THIS MAN SAYS YOU CAUSED
A DISTURBANCE AT HIS HOUSE.

21:58.025 --> 22:00.232
DO YOU ADMIT IT?

22:00.319 --> 22:01.775
YES, I MADE A MISTAKE.

22:01.862 --> 22:04.445
SAID YOU CLAIMED
IT WAS YOUR HOUSE.

22:04.532 --> 22:07.570
WELL, I THOUGHT IT WAS.
I'M SORRY.

22:07.660 --> 22:10.243
ARE YOU SATISFIED?

22:10.329 --> 22:12.195
WELL, AS LONG AS
HE OWNS UP TO IT.

22:12.289 --> 22:15.657
BUT YOU BETTER NOT
COME PESTERING ME AGAIN!

22:15.751 --> 22:17.492
I WON'T!

22:17.586 --> 22:20.248
GO ON BACK TO THE CAR.
I'LL BE ALONG IN A MINUTE.

22:23.425 --> 22:26.087

22:26.178 --> 22:29.091

- IS THIS YOUR WIFE?

22:29.181 --> 22:30.888
NO, WE'RE...

22:30.975 --> 22:33.888
- WE'RE JUST FRIENDS.
- WELL, MR. TALBOT,

22:33.978 --> 22:36.720
DO YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHAT YOU'RE DOING IN COEURVILLE?

22:36.814 --> 22:38.680
- YOU THE SHERIFF?!
- THAT'S RIGHT.

22:38.774 --> 22:41.232
- WHAT HAPPENED TO CARL?
- HE'S THE MAN I REPLACED.

22:41.318 --> 22:43.696
- DO YOU KNOW HIM?
- HE'S MY GODFATHER.

22:43.779 --> 22:46.897
WHERE CAN I FIND HIM?

22:46.991 --> 22:48.982
OVER THERE.

22:51.996 --> 22:53.282
OH, MISS...

22:55.749 --> 22:57.740
I CAN'T FORCE YOU
TO DO ANYTHING,

22:57.835 --> 23:00.577
BECAUSE YOU HA\/EN'T BROKEN ANY
LAVVS, BUT I'D LIKE TO SUGGEST

23:00.671 --> 23:03.504
THAT YOU TAKE HIM TO A DOCTOR.
HE LOOKS SICK.

23:03.591 --> 23:06.299
AND THE WAY HE WAS
STARING AT THAT GRAVE...

23:06.385 --> 23:08.592
IS HE KIN TO WALTER RYDER?

23:12.600 --> 23:14.432
I DON'T KNOW.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.482
LET'S GO, ALAN.

23:41.629 --> 23:44.246
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

23:44.340 --> 23:45.751
ALAN?

23:49.428 --> 23:51.669
DARLING, I KNOW
HOW UPSET YOU ARE,

23:51.764 --> 23:54.472
BUT THERE'S A RATIONAL
EXPLANATION FOR ALL THIS.

23:54.558 --> 23:56.549
THERE HAS TO BE.

23:59.063 --> 24:02.181
A FRIEND OF MINE,
DR. MATTHEWS...

24:02.274 --> 24:05.517
HE HAD A PATIENT WHO COULDN'T
EVEN REMEMBER HER OWN NAME.

24:05.611 --> 24:08.979
<i>SHE WAS ON A PLANE...

OR WHY, OR ANYTHING.
WHEN HE FIRST TALKED TO HER,

24:15.287 --> 24:19.781
SHE COULDN'T REMEMBER
A THING ABOUT HER LIFE.

24:19.875 --> 24:23.368
BUT AFTER TWO WEEKS,
SHE WAS JUST FINE.

24:23.462 --> 24:25.578
IT WAS A FORM OF AMNESIA.

24:25.673 --> 24:28.586
<i>[electronic whirring]</i>

24:28.676 --> 24:32.214
I THINK YOU SHOULD SEE HIM.

28:34.254 --> 28:36.416
MISTER,
I'M JUST GLAD YOU'RE ALIVE.

29:47.411 --> 29:49.652
[telephone rings]

29:54.209 --> 29:56.541
- YES?
- ALAN?

29:56.628 --> 29:59.245
OH, DARLING, I'VE BEEN CALLING
EVERY 15 MINUTES.

29:59.339 --> 30:00.795
I'VE BEEN SO WORRIED.

30:00.882 --> 30:03.670
WHAT HAPPENED?

30:03.760 --> 30:05.342
I'M NOT SURE.

30:05.429 --> 30:07.045
<i>ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?</i>

30:09.224 --> 30:11.932
I DON'T KNOW.

30:12.019 --> 30:13.680
ALAN...

30:13.770 --> 30:16.148
LOOK, JESS, WHY DON'T
YOU JUST FORGET ABOUT ME?

30:16.231 --> 30:18.222
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

30:19.443 --> 30:21.150
LISTEN TO ME.

30:21.194 --> 30:23.026
I CALLED DR. MATTHEWS

30:23.113 --> 30:26.151
AND I MADE AN APPOINTMENT
FOR YOU FOR TOMORROW MORNING.

30:26.241 --> 30:29.233
I'LL BE AT THE HOTEL
TO PICK YOU UP AT 9:30.

30:32.831 --> 30:35.664
YOU'D DO THAT AFTER
EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED?

30:35.751 --> 30:39.585
YES, I WOULD.

30:39.671 --> 30:41.753
MR. TALBOT, I...

30:41.840 --> 30:45.174
I DIDN'T PLAN
ON FALLING IN LOVE WITH YOU,

30:45.260 --> 30:47.376
BUT I DID...

30:47.471 --> 30:50.463
AND I'M STUCK WITH IT,
FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE.

30:55.270 --> 30:56.681
WELL, THANK YOU.

30:56.772 --> 30:58.513
WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO COME OVER NOW?

30:58.607 --> 31:01.565
NO, UH...

31:01.651 --> 31:03.187
UH...

31:03.278 --> 31:05.770
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW MORNING.

31:05.864 --> 31:08.856
- <i>GOOD NIGHT,</i> JESS.
<i>- TRYNOT TO WORRY, PLEASE.</i>

31:11.703 --> 31:13.319
GOOD NIGHT.

32:43.795 --> 32:45.786
HELLO, ALAN.

32:54.514 --> 32:56.630
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU.

33:11.823 --> 33:13.234
YOU'RE REAL?

33:13.325 --> 33:15.532
WELL,
THAT'S A MATTER OF OPINION.

33:15.619 --> 33:17.530
I USED TO THINK SO, YEARS AGO.

33:17.621 --> 33:20.454
NOW I'M NOT SO SURE.

33:20.540 --> 33:23.453
SIT DOWN, ALAN, OVER THERE.
I'LL POUR US A DRINK.

33:25.420 --> 33:28.128
GO ON, SIT DOWN.
THERE'S NOTHING TO BE AFRAID OF.

33:44.856 --> 33:47.518
BY THE VVAY, YOU ALMOST KILLED
ME VVITH THOSE SCISSORS.

33:47.609 --> 33:50.146
DID YOU KNOW THAT?

33:50.237 --> 33:51.853
IT'S A SHAME YOU DIDN'T.

33:53.657 --> 33:56.274
BUT THEN NOTHING
EVER WORKS OUT RIGHT FOR ME.

33:59.412 --> 34:01.870
SEE HOW CLOSE IT WAS?

34:05.669 --> 34:06.875
WHO ARE YOU?

34:06.962 --> 34:08.373
YOU MUST ALREADY KNOW THAT.

34:08.463 --> 34:09.873
HOW ELSE
COULD YOU HAVE FOUND ME.

34:09.965 --> 34:11.251
I LOOKED YOU UP
IN THE PHONE BOOK.

34:11.341 --> 34:14.800
YEAH, BUT HOW'D...

34:14.886 --> 34:18.379
OH, I SEE. YOU'VE BEEN TO
COEURVILLE, HAVEN'T YOU?

34:18.473 --> 34:20.089
YES!

34:22.268 --> 34:24.135
AND YOU KNOW... WHAT?

34:24.228 --> 34:26.971
- YOUR NAME.
- THAT'S ALL?

34:27.065 --> 34:28.476
THAT'S ALL.

34:28.567 --> 34:30.023
WELL, IN THAT CASE,

34:30.110 --> 34:32.442
YOU BETTER
HAVE SOME OF THAT DRINK.

34:44.833 --> 34:47.416
EXACTLY EIGHT DAYS AGO,

34:47.502 --> 34:49.708
YOU WERE BORN
HERE IN THIS HOUSE.

34:49.795 --> 34:52.003
WHAT?!

34:52.090 --> 34:55.047
I MADE THE DELIVERY MYSELF.

34:59.306 --> 35:01.718
- YOU'RE DRUNK!
- A LITTLE BIT...

35:03.310 --> 35:05.426
BUT NOT DRUNK ENOUGH.

35:05.520 --> 35:07.352
WILL YOU JOIN ME?

35:07.439 --> 35:10.977
I GUARANTEE NO HANGOVER.
WASN'T THAT THOUGHTFUL OF ME?

35:11.067 --> 35:13.855
LOOK, I'M IN NO MOOD
FOR JOKES, MISTER.

35:13.945 --> 35:16.437
THAT'S A PITY, BECAUSE
THIS WHOLE THING IS A JOKE.

35:16.531 --> 35:20.445
- YEAH, WELL, I'M NOT LAUGHING.
- YOU WILL,

35:20.535 --> 35:23.402
- BECAUSE THE JOKE'S ON ME.
- WOULD YOU GET TO THE POINT?

35:23.496 --> 35:25.453
WELL, YOU'VE BEEN TO COEURVILLE.

35:25.540 --> 35:28.453
YOU KNOW THAT
ALAN TALBOT NEVER LIVED THERE.

35:28.543 --> 35:32.002
YOU KNOW YOU'VE BEEN
BEHAVING ODDLY OF LATE.

35:32.088 --> 35:35.422
AND JUDGING FROM THAT
HANDKERCHIEF ON YOUR ARM,

35:35.508 --> 35:37.419
I'D SAY
YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT, TOO.

35:37.510 --> 35:41.048
SO, WITH ALL THIS INFORMATION,

35:41.139 --> 35:44.507
WHAT DO I NEED TO TELL YOU?

35:44.601 --> 35:46.763
WHO AM I?!

35:46.853 --> 35:51.689
YOU'RE NOBODY, ALAN,
NOBODY AT ALL.

35:51.775 --> 35:54.267
STOP IT, WALTER!

35:54.361 --> 35:57.479
WELL, <i>WHO</i> IS THIS WATCH
I'M WEARING? ASK ME THAT!

35:57.572 --> 35:59.939
<i>WHO</i> IS THE REFRIGERATOR
IN THE KITCHEN?

36:00.033 --> 36:04.027
- DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?
- NO.

36:05.997 --> 36:08.659
YOU'RE A MACHINE, ALAN,
A MECHANICAL DEVICE.

36:08.750 --> 36:11.492
I DON'T BELIEVE IT!

36:11.586 --> 36:15.079
I DON'T BLAME YOU.
I WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT, EITHER.

36:15.173 --> 36:18.291
BUT IT'S TRUE.

36:18.385 --> 36:21.628
THE FACT IS, YOU WERE BORN
A LONG TIME AGO, INSIDE MY HEAD.

36:21.721 --> 36:24.429
ALL KIDS HAVE DREAMS,
DON'T THEY?

36:24.516 --> 36:26.098
WELL, YOU WERE MINE.

36:26.184 --> 36:28.516
THE OTHERS THOUGHT ABOUT
JOINING THE ARMY

36:28.603 --> 36:30.435
OR FLYING TO MARS.

36:30.522 --> 36:33.105
AND THEY FINALLY GREW UP
AND THEY FORGOT THEIR DREAMS.

36:33.191 --> 36:35.523
I DIDN'T.

36:35.610 --> 36:40.320
I THOUGHT ABOUT ONE THING
AND LONGED FOR ONE THING ALWAYS.

36:40.407 --> 36:43.320
JUST ONE.

36:43.410 --> 36:45.367
A PERFECT ARTIFICIAL MAN.

36:45.453 --> 36:47.865
NOT A ROBOT--

36:47.914 --> 36:50.155
A DUPLICATE OF A HUMAN BEING.

36:52.627 --> 36:55.335
WELL, IT WAS HARMLESS.

36:55.422 --> 36:58.289
IT'S NOT EVEN VERY IMAGINATIVE
FOR A CHILD.

37:00.385 --> 37:03.753
BUT THEN I BECAME AN ADULT.

37:03.847 --> 37:06.555
ONLY SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE,
I FORGOT TO GROW UP--

37:06.641 --> 37:09.975
LIKE MOST GENIUSES.

37:10.061 --> 37:12.052
I KEPT MY DREAM.

37:14.441 --> 37:17.354
I CREATED YOU, ALAN.
IS THAT STRAIGHT ENOUGH FOR YOU?

37:19.070 --> 37:21.232
YOU'RE NOT ONLY DRUNK,
YOU'RE CRAZY!

37:23.408 --> 37:24.990
HOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT?

37:25.076 --> 37:28.410
WHAT, IT'S AN ARTIFICIAL ARM.
I DON'T KNOW!

37:30.665 --> 37:33.578
YOU EXPECT ME TO BELIEVE I'M A
MACHINE VVHEN I KNOVV I'M NOT?

37:33.668 --> 37:34.999
THAT'S RIDICULOUS!

37:35.086 --> 37:36.997
I EAT, I DRINK, I SLEEP!

37:37.088 --> 37:40.080
DIDN'T I TELL YOU
I WANTED A PERFECT CREATION?

37:43.887 --> 37:45.093
ALAN...

37:49.476 --> 37:53.014
ALAN, I WANT YOU
TO COME WITH ME.

37:53.104 --> 37:55.186
WHERE?

37:55.273 --> 37:59.688
WELL, LET'S CALL IT
THE, UH, DELIVERY ROOM.

37:59.778 --> 38:01.940
DON'T YOU WANT TO SEE
WHERE YOU WERE BORN?

38:23.718 --> 38:25.129
YOUR BIRTHPLACE.

38:30.141 --> 38:31.552
COME ON.

39:02.590 --> 39:04.706
<i>[pulsating noise]</i>

39:06.219 --> 39:09.712
<i>[electronic whirring]</i>

39:12.559 --> 39:14.641
TURN IT OFF!

39:30.577 --> 39:32.409
OVER HERE, ALAN.

39:40.795 --> 39:42.627
YOUR BROTHERS.

39:45.800 --> 39:47.211
ALAN TALBOT I...

39:49.387 --> 39:51.674
AND ALAN TALBOT II.

39:53.433 --> 39:55.390
<i>F ACTORY REJECTS.</i>

39:55.435 --> 39:57.346
ANY QUESTIONS?

39:59.105 --> 40:01.142
WHERE DID YOU GET THE MONEY
FOR ALL THIS?

40:01.232 --> 40:03.439
[laughing]

40:03.526 --> 40:06.143
I TOLD YOU, I'M A GENIUS!

40:06.237 --> 40:08.729
WHEN I FOUND OUT HOW MUCH
I'D NEED FOR MY WORK,

40:08.823 --> 40:10.905
I DEVELOPED
AN IMPROVED CALCULATOR.

40:10.992 --> 40:13.154
TRY ELECTRONICS TURNS OUT
3 OR 4,000 A YEAR.

40:13.244 --> 40:15.030
I GET THE ROYALTIES.

40:15.121 --> 40:18.204
THE MONEY WAS THE LEAST OF IT.

40:18.291 --> 40:20.248
THE FAILURES, THOUGH,
THEY WERE BAD.

40:20.335 --> 40:22.326
I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW MANY TIMES I'VE FAILED

40:22.420 --> 40:24.161
AND HAD TO START OVER AGAIN.

40:24.255 --> 40:26.917
AND YOU DID THIS
ALL BY YOURSELF?

40:27.008 --> 40:30.546
NO, THAT WOULDN'T
HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE.

40:30.637 --> 40:33.470
I'M AFRAID THE DAY
OF THE LONE INVENTOR HAS PASSED.

40:33.556 --> 40:37.345
I HAD SOME OF THE BEST SCIENTIFIC
MINDS IN THE VVORLD ASSISTING ME.

40:37.435 --> 40:41.599
BUT, OF COURSE, THEY DIDN'T TAKE THE PROJECT
SERIOUSLY. TO THEM, IT VVAS JUST A GAME-

40:41.689 --> 40:43.726
A LOT OF THEORETICAL
WOOL-GATHERING.

40:43.816 --> 40:46.854
HOW WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO
CREATE AN ENTIRE NERVOUS SYSTEM

40:46.945 --> 40:48.902
THAT WORKED LIKE A REAL ONE?

40:48.988 --> 40:52.356
HOVV COULD THE BRAIN BE DUPLICATED
VVITH ALL ITS SUBTLETIES?

40:52.450 --> 40:56.193
YOU SEE,
I WAS AFTER REAL INTELLIGENCE.

40:56.287 --> 40:59.905
MERE REACTIONS WEREN'T ENOUGH.
THOSE MANNEQUINS CAN REACT.

41:01.668 --> 41:04.751
MY CREATION
HAD TO HAVE A MEMORY.

41:04.837 --> 41:06.999
HE HAD TO HAVE
ABSTRACT REASONING POWER,

41:07.090 --> 41:09.582
A PAST, A PERSONALITY.

41:09.676 --> 41:13.590
MILLIONS OF INTRICATE FACETS
MULTIPLIED BY MILLIONS.

41:13.680 --> 41:17.014
TO MAKE TRUE INTELLIGENCE.

41:17.100 --> 41:19.011
NOW...

41:19.102 --> 41:21.218
TO ACCOMPLISH THIS
FROM THE BEGINNING

41:21.312 --> 41:23.098
WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE.

41:23.189 --> 41:27.899
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU DECIDED TO USE YOURSELF?

41:27.986 --> 41:29.772
JUST THAT.

41:29.862 --> 41:32.604
IN CERTAIN OF YOUR CELLS,
I MADE CERTAIN IMPRESSIONS.

41:32.699 --> 41:35.031
MY OWN MEMORIES
WENT INTO THE CELLS.

41:35.118 --> 41:39.203
SOME OF MY TALENTS, SOME OF MY
KNOWLEDGE-- BITS AND PIECES OF MYSELF.

41:39.288 --> 41:41.996
SO NOW YOU'RE TELLING ME
THAT I'M YOU?

41:42.083 --> 41:43.824
THAT'S RIGHT.

41:43.918 --> 41:47.286
WELL, THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
I'M ME! THIS IS MY FLESH!

41:49.716 --> 41:52.629
NONCONDUCTIVE PLASTIC.

41:52.719 --> 41:55.051
I ADMIT, IT FEELS LIKE FLESH...

41:55.138 --> 41:57.630
BUT THEN, THAT WAS THE IDEA.

41:57.724 --> 42:01.262
YOU SEE, I CUSHIONED THE MECHANICAL
PARTS VVITH A FOAM LAYER,

42:01.352 --> 42:03.389
AND THEN I WORKED OUT A...

42:03.479 --> 42:07.438
BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT
YOU WANT TO HEAR, IS IT?

42:07.525 --> 42:10.643
- YOU LIVED IN COEURVILLE?
- YES.

42:10.737 --> 42:13.274
FOR YOUR PAST, I GAVE YOU
MY MEMORIES OF THE TOWN.

42:13.364 --> 42:16.106
SOME OF THEM MUST HAVE BEEN
INACCURATE AND INCOMPLETE.

42:16.200 --> 42:19.192
I LEFT COEURVILLE 2O YEARS AGO.
BUT GOING THERE MUST'VE BEEN

42:19.287 --> 42:21.244
- QUITE AN EXPERIENCE.
- YEAH, IT WAS.

42:21.330 --> 42:23.662
YEAH, IT WAS.

42:23.750 --> 42:25.661
WHAT ABOUT THE UNIVERSITY?

42:25.752 --> 42:29.290
FICTITIOUS.
I HAD TO GIVE YOU A JOB.

42:29.380 --> 42:31.166
WELL, AUNT MILDRED!

42:31.257 --> 42:34.295
ALL THE OLD LADIES
I'VE EVER KNOWN ROLLED INTO ONE.

42:34.385 --> 42:38.253
AFTER MY PARENTS DIED,
I LIVED ALONE.

42:38.347 --> 42:41.476
WITH THE REPUTATION
AS A DON JUAN

42:41.559 --> 42:46.099
IS, I REGRET TO SAY,
IMAGINARY.

42:46.189 --> 42:47.930
WELL, THAT'S ABOUT IT, ALAN.

42:48.024 --> 42:49.890
THE REST YOU CAN FILL IN,
UP TO LAST WEEK, ANYWAY.

42:49.984 --> 42:52.476
- WHAT ABOUT LAST WEEK?
- I WISH I KNEW.

42:52.570 --> 42:55.107
SOMETHING WENT WRONG.

42:55.198 --> 42:56.905
I COULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

42:56.991 --> 42:58.277
YOU SUDDENLY ATTACKED ME
WITH A PAIR OF SCISSORS

42:58.367 --> 43:00.074
AND THEN RAN AWAY.

43:00.161 --> 43:02.072
AS YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN UNABLE
TO FIND YOU SINCE.

43:02.163 --> 43:05.906
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME?
- I'M NOT SURE.

43:06.000 --> 43:09.118
WHATEVER IT IS,
IT'S WRONG WITH ME, TOO.

43:09.212 --> 43:13.171
WE'RE ALL POTENTIAL MURDERERS.
BUT IF WE'RE NORMAL,

43:13.257 --> 43:15.214
WE'RE PROTECTED
BY OUR INHIBITIONS.

43:15.301 --> 43:20.137
- YOU'VE WANTED TO KILL?
- OF COURSE. EVERYBODY HAS.

43:20.223 --> 43:23.966
BUT MY OWN INHIBITIONS
HAVE HELD MY IMPULSES IN CHECK.

43:24.060 --> 43:26.677
I COULDN'T KILL, NO MATTER
HOW MUCH I MIGHT WANT TO.

43:26.771 --> 43:29.138
- SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?
- WITH YOU,

43:29.232 --> 43:31.348
SOMETHING WENT WRONG.

43:31.442 --> 43:33.934
TO PUT IT EVEN CLEARER, ALAN,
YOU'RE INSANE.

43:41.619 --> 43:44.737
- CAN I BE TREATED?
- REPAIRED, YOU MEAN?

43:44.831 --> 43:47.539
- I DON'T KNOW.
- WHY NOT?

43:47.625 --> 43:50.458
VVELL, AS MUCH AS I HATE TO
ADMIT IT, LUCK HAD A GREAT DEAL

43:50.545 --> 43:54.163
TO DO WITH YOUR CREATION.
SKILL ALONE WASN'T ENOUGH.

43:54.257 --> 43:57.750
- YOU SAYING I'M AN ACCIDENT?
- I'M AFRAID SO.

43:57.844 --> 44:00.552
YOU SEE, ALAN, I WAS LIKE
A BLIND MAN WITH A MACHINE GUN.

44:00.638 --> 44:02.629
I KEPT FIRING
AND RELOADING AND FIRING,

44:02.723 --> 44:05.340
AND FINALLY I HIT THE TARGET,
BUT IT WAS OFF-CENTER.

44:05.434 --> 44:07.391
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF I COULD COME CLOSE AGAIN.

44:07.478 --> 44:10.766
THAT'S THE STORY OF MY LIFE.
RIGHT DOWN THE LINE.

44:10.857 --> 44:13.394
SUCCESS IN THE LITTLE THINGS.

44:13.484 --> 44:15.862
FAILURE IN THE BIG ONES.

44:15.945 --> 44:19.563
I TOLD MYSELF I WANTED TO MAKE
AN ARTIFICIAL MAN,

44:19.657 --> 44:21.989
BUT I THINK WHAT I REALLY WANTED

44:22.076 --> 44:25.194
WAS TO BUILD
ANOTHER WALTER RYDER--

44:25.288 --> 44:27.780
ONLY WITHOUT THE DRAWBACKS.

44:27.874 --> 44:29.956
SORT OF A REVERSE
JEKYLL AND HYDE.

44:30.042 --> 44:34.001
EVERYTHING I WISHED I WAS,
MY CREATION WOULD BE.

44:34.088 --> 44:37.001
WHERE I WAS SHY,
HE WOULD BE AGGRESSIVE.

44:37.091 --> 44:40.584
WHERE I WAS COLD AND WITHDRAWN,
HE WOULD BE WARM AND OUTGOING.

44:40.678 --> 44:43.215
LONELINESS
WOULD BE UNKNOWN TO HIM.

44:43.306 --> 44:46.924
DISEASE AND PAIN
AND DEATH-- ALL UNKNOWN.

44:47.018 --> 44:50.010
HE WOULD BE UNSELFISH.

44:50.104 --> 44:52.812
HE WOULD BE AMBITIOUS
BUT NOT FANATICAL.

44:52.899 --> 44:56.358
AND, OH, ALAN,
HE WOULD BE PERFECT!

44:56.444 --> 44:58.981
THAT WAS MY DREAM:
A PERFECT VERSION OF MYSELF.

45:00.781 --> 45:02.442
I OUGHT TO KILL YOU.

45:05.119 --> 45:09.704
THAT'S RIGHT. YOU SHOULD.

45:09.790 --> 45:12.953
THERE'S SOMEBODY ELSE,
WALTER-- A GIRL.

45:13.044 --> 45:15.832
WE WERE GONNA BE
MARRIED NEXT WEEK.

45:15.922 --> 45:19.460
- IS SHE PRETTY?
- PRETTY, INTELLIGENT.

45:19.550 --> 45:22.793
AND LONELY- SOMETHING YOU OUGHT
TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND.

45:25.723 --> 45:27.134
I'M SORRY, ALAN.

45:27.225 --> 45:30.638
WELL,
THAT'S A GREAT CONSOLATION.

45:30.728 --> 45:33.641
- YOU SURE YOU CAN'T FIX ME?
- EVEN IF I COULD IT WOULDN'T

45:33.731 --> 45:35.187
SOLVE YOUR PROBLEMS.

45:35.274 --> 45:37.311
THE GIRL WOULD
FIND OUT EVENTUALLY.

45:37.401 --> 45:40.063
- HOW?
- WELL, FOR ONE THING,

45:40.154 --> 45:42.270
SHE WOULD GROW OLD
AND YOU WOULDN'T.

45:42.365 --> 45:44.072
FOR ANOTHER,
BEING A MACHINE,

45:44.158 --> 45:46.866
YOU WOULD SUFFER
A BREAKDOWN SOMEDAY.

45:46.953 --> 45:50.071
ALL OF THESE THINGS
NEVER OCCURRED TO YOU?

45:50.164 --> 45:53.532
I GUESS I DIDN'T REALLY THINK
I'D SUCCEED AS WELL AS I DID.

45:53.626 --> 45:55.867
WHAT DOES IT MATTER ANYWAY?
THERE'S NOTHING

45:55.962 --> 45:58.545
- THAT CAN BE DONE.
- YES, THERE IS.

45:58.631 --> 46:01.749
YOU'RE GONNA CREATE
ANOTHER ALAN TALBOT.

46:01.842 --> 46:04.675
- NO, I JUST TOLD YOU!
- YOU HEARD ME--

46:04.762 --> 46:09.677
ANOTHER ALAN TALBOT!
ONLY THIS ONE'S GONNA BE RIGHT.

46:09.767 --> 46:12.759
AND HE'S GONNA VVALK OUT OF HERE
TONIGHT, AND HE'S GONNA MARRY

46:12.853 --> 46:16.096
A GIRL NAMED JESS, AND FOR THE
FIRST TIME IN HIS MISERABLE LIFE,

46:16.190 --> 46:20.024
- HE'S GONNA BE HAPPY.
- WELL, I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

46:20.111 --> 46:21.943
NOW YOU GIVE ME A PENCIL.

46:26.617 --> 46:29.325
NOW, THIS IS HER NAME...

46:29.412 --> 46:31.824
AND ADDRESS.

46:31.914 --> 46:35.703
SHE SAID SHE WOULD
MEET ME AT 9:30 IN THE MORNING,

46:35.793 --> 46:37.625

48:26.862 --> 48:28.944
WHY ARE YOU
LOOKING AT ME LIKE THAT?

48:31.534 --> 48:33.525
I DON'T KNOW.

48:36.747 --> 48:39.660
I'VE BEEN SO WORRIED.

48:39.750 --> 48:43.789
- AFTER YESTERDAY, I DIDN'T--
- WELL, FORGET YESTERDAY.

48:43.879 --> 48:47.247
WHATEVER HAPPENED,
FORGET THAT.

48:47.341 --> 48:49.298
- OH, BUT, ALAN...
- PLEASE?

48:49.385 --> 48:52.673
VVE JUST HAD A ROTTEN
NIGHTMARE, THAT'S ALL.

48:52.763 --> 48:56.472
NOW WE'RE AWAKE,
AND EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE FINE.

48:56.559 --> 49:00.052
WILL YOU TRY TO BELIEVE THAT?

49:00.146 --> 49:02.057
DO YOU?

49:02.148 --> 49:03.604
YES.

49:07.945 --> 49:10.482
OKAY.

49:10.573 --> 49:12.189
THEN SO DO I.

49:13.951 --> 49:17.285

TO TELL ME ABOUT IT SOMEDAY.

49:17.371 --> 49:20.284
I'LL PROMISE, SOMEDAY.

49:20.374 --> 49:23.492
NOW, WILL YOU FIX ME
A CUP OF COFFEE?

49:23.586 --> 49:24.917
SURE.

49:25.004 --> 49:26.870
