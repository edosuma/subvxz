﻿Do you have a phone.

﻿You know what, Mathilde?

21:41.659 --> 21:43.018
﻿You've been very clever
﻿haven't you?

21:44.977 --> 21:45.857
﻿Haven't you?

21:51.258 --> 21:52.376

﻿Dad came over and yelled at Mom
﻿and she was upset.

22:11.857 --> 22:14.818
﻿Then he went into Oliver's room
﻿and screamed.

22:16.578 --> 22:18.977
﻿I think he was screaming
﻿at Oliver.

22:22.938 --> 22:25.737
﻿And then he grabbed mom
﻿by the hair.

22:25.939 --> 22:27.377
﻿ls Oliver your little brother?

22:27.618 --> 22:31.338
﻿Yes. Then mom screamed.

22:31.539 --> 22:35.498
﻿And he took the knife,
﻿and they left.

22:37.339 --> 22:40.378
﻿Don't let a thing happen to Mom.

22:40.579 --> 22:41.818
﻿Right, but...

22:42.298 --> 22:45.979
﻿Listen...
﻿I don't want him to kill mom.

22:46.618 --> 22:49.419
﻿No one is going
﻿to kill your mom. Okay?

22:52.419 --> 22:54.898
﻿Do you promise? ﻿I promise.

22:56.978 --> 22:59.539
﻿Mathilde, I'm with the police.
﻿Do you know who the police are?

23:02.980 --> 23:04.538
﻿Yes, I think so.

23:04.899 --> 23:07.219
﻿Right. We're protectors.

23:09.499 --> 23:10.659

23:10.939 --> 23:14.338
﻿We protect people who need help.

23:15.379 --> 23:17.738

﻿and bring her back

23:19.618 --> 23:23.218
﻿to you and your brother. Okay?
﻿Okay.

23:24.779 --> 23:25.658
﻿And in the meantime

23:25.859 --> 23:29.498
﻿I'll send some officers
﻿to look after you and Oliver.

23:30.459 --> 23:32.898
﻿Would you like me to do that?
﻿Yes.

23:34.660 --> 23:37.178
﻿I'll do that.
﻿Don't let anything happen to Mom.

23:37.339 --> 23:39.059
﻿Nothing is going
﻿to happen to your mother.

23:39.580 --> 23:43.898
﻿Someone will be with you soon
﻿If you need any help

23:44.100 --> 23:46.179
﻿then call 1-1-2.

23:47.379 --> 23:50.219
﻿One-one-two.
﻿That's right. 1-1-2.

﻿Can you remember that?

23:52.740 --> 23:54.139
﻿One-one-two.

23:55.380 --> 23:56.179
﻿Good.

23:57.099 --> 23:57.939
﻿Good girl, Mathilde

23:58.419 --> 24:01.978
﻿I have to go now.
﻿I'm afraid of being alone.

24:06.779 --> 24:08.199
﻿You know what I do
﻿when I feel lonely?

24:08.460 --> 24:12.979
﻿I turn on the TV.
﻿Then I have company.

24:14.380 --> 24:16.258
﻿Why don't you do that?
﻿lt's broken.

24:19.820 --> 24:25.179
﻿Why don't you sit
﻿with your brother?

24:27.181 --> 24:30.620
﻿Dad said I wasn't allowed to.
﻿Forget what your dad said.

24:31.220 --> 24:32.380
﻿Go in there.

24:33.061 --> 24:34.460
﻿What if I wake him up?

24:35.061 --> 24:37.939
﻿You won't if you're very quiet.

24:38.820 --> 24:42.420
﻿Just go in very quietly
﻿and stay until the police come.

24:42.660 --> 24:43.579
﻿Can you do that?

24:45.541 --> 24:46.580
﻿Are you sure?

24:46.780 --> 24:47.980
﻿I'm positive.

24:49.541 --> 24:51.100
﻿Go be with your brother.

24:52.821 --> 24:54.900
﻿Okay. I'm going in there now.

﻿Nothing.

﻿Has anyone got a call
﻿from Iben Østergård?

﻿They're not going
﻿to his place...

26:00.101 --> 26:03.980
﻿I have to relay it now.
﻿But what's your plan?

26:04.901 --> 26:07.100
﻿To wait until they find the van.

26:09.181 --> 26:11.821
﻿Yes, but... ﻿Asger.

26:12.062 --> 26:13.481
﻿The quicker they get
﻿the plate number,

26:13.622 --> 26:15.700
﻿the faster we'll find them,
﻿right?

26:15.981 --> 26:21.461
﻿Thanks for the plate number.
﻿Listen. I was thinking that.

26:21.662 --> 26:25.860

27:37.143 --> 27:37.942
﻿Yes?

27:41.623 --> 27:44.021
﻿I'd like to apologize
﻿for my behavior.

27:45.023 --> 27:47.382
﻿Not just today,
﻿but on the whole

27:49.303 --> 27:52.062
﻿I know I've been.

27:54.143 --> 27:56.422
﻿Will you accept my apology?

28:01.583 --> 28:03.743
﻿You bet. ﻿Thanks.

28:09.743 --> 28:12.983
﻿Can I ask you
﻿a technical question?

28:13.943 --> 28:14.942
﻿Of course.

28:15.143 --> 28:17.062
﻿If I log out
﻿and change computers

28:17.264 --> 28:19.902
﻿will I still get calls
﻿from previous callers?

28:20.503 --> 28:21.622
﻿Yes.

28:22.024 --> 28:24.583
﻿They follow your log-in
﻿and not the computer,

28:24.783 --> 28:26.702
﻿so the system
﻿Where are you going?

28:27.024 --> 28:28.023
﻿To the other room.

28:28.624 --> 28:30.982
﻿Why? We're off in 15 minutes.

﻿Hi, Bo. It's Asger.

29:03.744 --> 29:06.943
﻿Christ! You again?
﻿Aren't you ever off duty?

29:07.625 --> 29:08.863
﻿Am I interrupting something?

29:09.665 --> 29:10.784
﻿Everything all right?

29:11.144 --> 29:13.702
﻿lt's more boring
﻿than taking a crap.

29:15.104 --> 29:16.182
﻿I know.

29:16.624 --> 29:19.743
﻿Time passes slowly. ﻿III say.

29:20.464 --> 29:21.382
﻿So you aren't busy?

29:22.064 --> 29:26.864
﻿lt's calmed down. You?
﻿Same here.

29:27.065 --> 29:31.823
﻿Could you do me a favor? ﻿Sure.

29:32.025 --> 29:35.663
﻿Send a car to 12 Strandlodsvej
﻿on Amager. It's urgent.

29:36.465 --> 29:39.423
﻿Why?
﻿A Michael Berg lives there.

29:39.664 --> 29:42.224
﻿A convicted felon
﻿who kidnapped his wife.

29:42.425 --> 29:44.824
﻿Are they there?
﻿No, they're in North Zealand.

29:46.305 --> 29:48.263
﻿Then talk to North Zealand.

29:50.545 --> 29:51.464
﻿I don't understand.

29:51.665 --> 29:54.145
﻿North Zealand is looking
﻿for the car.

29:54.425 --> 29:56.503
﻿But his home is in your district.

29:56.705 --> 29:59.184
﻿There might be clues
﻿to where he's going

29:59.385 --> 30:00.903
﻿fs there anyone at the address?

30:02.585 --> 30:05.384
﻿He lives alone. I don't know.
﻿But otherwise, break in.

30:05.985 --> 30:06.943
﻿What was that?

30:08.704 --> 30:09.663
﻿Break in.

30:10.344 --> 30:11.584
﻿What was that, Asger?

30:15.465 --> 30:18.224
﻿I talked to a six-year-old
﻿and promised her

30:18.425 --> 30:20.384
﻿that her mother would come home.

30:20.586 --> 30:21.664
﻿Enough!

30:29.705 --> 30:30.985
﻿This isn't your job.

30:34.345 --> 30:36.544
﻿I know that.
﻿Yes, you certainly do.

30:38.105 --> 30:39.754
﻿Does this have anything to do
﻿with tomorrow?

30:43.025 --> 30:46.265
﻿I'm fine. I'm just trying
﻿to do my job. I'm trying to...

30:48.026 --> 30:51.105
﻿Would you like to talk
﻿to a new psychologist?

30:51.265 --> 30:52.425
﻿I know you didn't like
﻿the last one...

30:52.585 --> 30:54.705
﻿No, I'm fine.

30:58.345 --> 30:59.185

﻿on the street

31:09.465 --> 31:10.625
﻿and off the damn phone.

﻿Because that's what you want,
﻿isn't it?

31:22.946 --> 31:24.625
﻿Isn't it, Asger?

31:28.186 --> 31:29.624
﻿Yes ﻿What?

31:30.186 --> 31:31.225
﻿Yes.

31:32.546 --> 31:34.105
﻿Send my love to Patricia.

31:34.586 --> 31:35.626
﻿She isn't here.

53:54.364 --> 53:57.484

﻿Hi. Any news?

54:15.565 --> 54:18.804
﻿I have Iben on the line
﻿She's in the back of the van.

54:19.605 --> 54:20.488
﻿Do you have a location?

54:20.645 --> 54:23.044
﻿The cell tower is near Elsinore.

54:23.245 --> 54:24.844
﻿South by southwest ﻿of Elsinore

54:25.406 --> 54:29.324
﻿I need a precise location.

54:32.085 --> 54:34.204
﻿I'll get it.
﻿Just send the patrol car.

54:34.405 --> 54:35.364
﻿How will you get it?

54:36.205 --> 54:37.804
﻿I'll get her out of the van.

54:38.326 --> 54:40.924
﻿Iben, are you there?

54:42.565 --> 54:45.004
I'﻿m back. ﻿Don't hang up again.

54:45.206 --> 54:50.285
﻿I won't.
﻿I want to go home to my kids.

54:50.605 --> 54:54.004
﻿They shouldn't be alone.
﻿No. Now listen

54:54.205 --> 54:55.394
﻿I don't know
﻿why he's doing this.

54:55.446 --> 54:58.725
﻿lben? Iben! Now listen to me.

55:00.085 --> 55:01.484
﻿Find something
﻿to use as a weapon.

55:03.246 --> 55:05.524
﻿Help is coming
﻿but we need a plan B, okay?

55:06.726 --> 55:09.804
﻿I'm going to die.
﻿No, you're not. Listen to me.

55:10.926 --> 55:14.765
﻿Help is on the way, but if he stops
﻿you need to defend yourself.

55:15.606 --> 55:16.525
﻿Do you understand?

55:17.406 --> 55:18.844
﻿Why does Michael have a van?

55:21.526 --> 55:22.485
﻿He's a bricklayer.

55:23.486 --> 55:26.045
﻿Then he must have some tools.

55:26.246 --> 55:28.485
﻿I don't know. ﻿Look around.

55:29.006 --> 55:30.204
﻿I can't see anything.

55:32.966 --> 55:34.005
﻿Feel your way.

55:43.607 --> 55:44.490
﻿Did you find something?

55:44.766 --> 55:47.325
﻿A cardboard box. It's heavy.

55:47.847 --> 55:48.645
﻿Okay.

55:50.126 --> 55:50.925
﻿What's inside it?

55:52.886 --> 55:53.805
﻿Rocks, I think.

55:54.926 --> 55:57.084
﻿Bricks. That's good
﻿Can you pick one up?

55:59.766 --> 56:00.805
﻿Iben, pick one up.

56:01.206 --> 56:04.005
﻿I've got one.
﻿Good. Now listen carefully.

56:04.366 --> 56:05.486
﻿If he stops the van...

56:06.207 --> 56:10.046
﻿and opens the door,
﻿you hit him as hard as you can.

56:12.326 --> 56:14.526
﻿I can't do that! ﻿Yes, you can.

56:15.207 --> 56:17.647
﻿Then take his knife.
﻿Then tell me... Easy now.

56:17.846 --> 56:21.326
﻿Tell me where you are
﻿and I'll send a car.

56:21.607 --> 56:23.326
﻿I can't! ﻿Yes, you can, Iben.

56:24.806 --> 56:27.086
﻿Breathe. Take a deep breath
﻿Come on now.

56:28.847 --> 56:30.285
﻿Just like this. Iben?

56:31.967 --> 56:34.565
﻿lben
﻿I don't know why he's doing this.

56:37.647 --> 56:38.646
﻿lben ﻿I'm going to die.

56:38.847 --> 56:41.565
﻿You're not.
﻿lben, breathe with me.

56:44.447 --> 56:45.526
﻿Breathe, Iben.

56:50.527 --> 56:52.286
﻿Iben, what's your favorite food?

56:55.367 --> 56:56.406
﻿What's your favorite food?

56:57.047 --> 56:58.367
﻿Pork sausage.

56:58.927 --> 57:01.487
﻿Pork sausage? Do you like that?

57:03.047 --> 57:04.247
﻿Yes. Don't you?

57:04.807 --> 57:07.086
﻿I don't eat pork. What else?

57:09.608 --> 57:10.567
﻿Are you a Muslim?

57:10.848 --> 57:14.287
﻿No. What do you do
﻿in your free time?

57:16.007 --> 57:18.286
﻿I like to be
﻿with Thilde and Oliver.

57:19.727 --> 57:20.887
﻿But Michael.

57:21.087 --> 57:24.727
﻿What do you do with your kids?

57:25.567 --> 57:26.726
﻿What's a nice thing to do?

57:29.248 --> 57:30.727
﻿We like The Blue Planet.

57:32.607 --> 57:35.247
﻿The aquarium on Amager?

57:37.208 --> 57:38.247
﻿Haven't you been there?

57:39.127 --> 57:41.727
﻿No, unfortunately.
﻿Tell me about The Blue Planet.

57:42.848 --> 57:43.767
﻿ls it nice?

57:44.968 --> 57:47.246
﻿Thilde likes the turtles.

57:48.568 --> 57:51.687
﻿She doesn't even look
﻿at the sharks.

57:53.209 --> 57:54.767
﻿What do you like best?
﻿The sharks?

57:59.808 --> 58:01.486
﻿I like all of them

58:04.968 --> 58:08.207
﻿I usually walk behind Thilde
﻿with Oliver in the baby carriage.

58:09.088 --> 58:10.568
﻿Then I just look and feel.

58:11.408 --> 58:12.447
﻿Feel what?

58:14.489 --> 58:15.607
﻿It seems so peaceful.

58:16.608 --> 58:17.648
﻿What does?

58:20.769 --> 58:21.767
﻿Under the water.

58:25.049 --> 58:26.847
﻿Like... quiet.

58:29.048 --> 58:30.208
﻿No distractions.

58:31.968 --> 58:34.648
﻿Just water flowing slowly
﻿around you.

58:35.689 --> 58:36.607
﻿Very quiet.

58:38.769 --> 58:40.327
﻿Just a big, blue silence.

58:43.848 --> 58:44.688
﻿co

58:48.769 --> 58:50.288
﻿I don't know your name.

58:51.769 --> 58:52.648

﻿He's stopping.
﻿Do you have the brick?

59:40.769 --> 59:43.648
﻿Yes. ﻿Take it easy, Iben

59:44.290 --> 59:47.049
﻿I'm here for you. All right?

59:47.570 --> 59:48.809
﻿Put your phone away.

59:49.009 --> 59:51.648
﻿When he opens the door,
﻿hit him as hard as you can.

59:52.369 --> 59:55.048
﻿He deserves it ﻿He deserves it.

59:55.250 --> 59:58.809
﻿That's right. Put your phone
﻿in your pocket and.

59:59.009 --> 01:00:02.929
﻿He doesn't understand me.
﻿I know. Put the phone away.

01:00:03.409 --> 01:00:05.849
﻿When he opens the door...
﻿Oliver is fine.

01:00:06.050 --> 01:00:09.569
﻿He isn't crying now.

01:00:09.970 --> 01:00:11.610
﻿What do you mean?

01:00:15.410 --> 01:00:16.410
﻿The snakes.

01:00:17.290 --> 01:00:19.329
﻿What snakes?

01:00:20.690 --> 01:00:22.049
﻿He was in so much pain.

01:00:25.851 --> 01:00:26.889
﻿ln his stomach.

01:00:31.091 --> 01:00:32.410
﻿He kept crying

01:00:32.610 --> 01:00:34.129
﻿because he had snakes
﻿in his stomach

01:00:41.130 --> 01:00:43.649
﻿I just took them out.
﻿Was it you?

01:00:43.850 --> 01:00:46.489
﻿He's much better now.
﻿He isn't crying anymore.

01:00:56.930 --> 01:00:58.170
﻿He's fine, isn't he?

01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:00.930

﻿Go away! Go away!

﻿Hello?

﻿Hello?

01:02:19.492 --> 01:02:20.371
﻿Are you there, Asger?

01:02:24.772 --> 01:02:26.931
﻿I think there's something wrong
﻿with my phone. Hang on.

01:02:29.852 --> 01:02:31.251
﻿Can you hear me? ﻿Yes

01:02:32.251 --> 01:02:33.249
﻿I think I found something.

01:02:36.292 --> 01:02:37.520
﻿They went to court over custody.

01:02:37.812 --> 01:02:40.731
﻿Michael has a lot of letters
﻿from a lawyer in Copenhagen.

01:02:41.971 --> 01:02:43.931
﻿He lost his visitation rights.

01:02:45.492 --> 01:02:46.972
﻿lt's about his criminal record

01:02:47.492 --> 01:02:48.643
﻿and his sentences for assault.

01:02:49.932 --> 01:02:51.492
﻿It's no fucking wonder.

01:02:53.652 --> 01:02:55.171
﻿Asger? ﻿Yes' Yes.

01:02:55.572 --> 01:02:57.412
﻿Sorry. I'll get to the point.

01:03:00.092 --> 01:03:01.410
﻿The only thing
﻿about North Zealand.

01:03:02.932 --> 01:03:04.570
It's a psychiatric center.

01:03:05.572 --> 01:03:08.652
﻿She was in the North Zealand
﻿Psychiatric Center in Elsinore.

01:03:09.372 --> 01:03:10.491
﻿In Elsinore?

01:03:11.413 --> 01:03:12.372
﻿Exactly.

01:03:13.892 --> 01:03:15.273
﻿The North Zealand
﻿Psychiatric Center?

01:03:18.692 --> 01:03:19.572
﻿Is that of any use?

01:03:20.812 --> 01:03:21.652
﻿Locked up.

01:03:22.572 --> 01:03:23.372
﻿What was that?

01:03:23.573 --> 01:03:24.800
﻿She doesn't want to be locked up.

01:03:25.653 --> 01:03:27.012
﻿You lost me there.

01:03:29.773 --> 01:03:30.572
﻿Asger?

01:03:32.173 --> 01:03:33.011
﻿Hello?

01:04:18.373 --> 01:04:19.413
﻿Michael?

01:04:21.773 --> 01:04:22.573
﻿Michael?

01:04:23.373 --> 01:04:24.172
﻿Hello?

01:04:24.574 --> 01:04:25.772
﻿Where are you?

01:04:28.494 --> 01:04:29.453
﻿Michael?

01:04:30.333 --> 01:04:32.136
﻿Are you at the North Zealand
﻿Psychiatric Center?

01:04:32.694 --> 01:04:35.893
﻿Who is this?
﻿Asger from the police.

01:04:36.094 --> 01:04:38.333
﻿Are you at the
﻿Psychiatric Center in Elsinore?

01:04:39.454 --> 01:04:41.333
﻿Yes. ﻿Where's Iben?

01:04:42.253 --> 01:04:43.133
﻿I don't know.

01:04:45.293 --> 01:04:46.372
﻿I think she hit me.

01:04:48.934 --> 01:04:52.252
﻿I'll send the police.
﻿Do you need an ambulance?

01:04:52.454 --> 01:04:53.293
﻿No police.

01:04:54.374 --> 01:04:55.412
﻿I have to.

01:04:55.694 --> 01:04:57.172
﻿I haven't fucking done
﻿anything!

01:04:57.374 --> 01:04:58.853
﻿I know. I know.

01:05:04.374 --> 01:05:06.013
﻿Why didn't you tell me?

01:05:09.134 --> 01:05:11.573
﻿You should have called the police
﻿and let us take care of Iben.

01:05:11.774 --> 01:05:14.373
﻿So you could help her or what?
﻿Yes. That's our job.

01:05:16.974 --> 01:05:18.893
﻿Nobody is of any help.

01:05:19.934 --> 01:05:20.854
﻿I tried.

01:05:21.215 --> 01:05:23.974
﻿Doctors, lawyers,
﻿the municipality.

01:05:24.175 --> 01:05:25.534
﻿None of them will help.

01:05:25.974 --> 01:05:27.493
﻿I'm trying to help.

01:05:29.454 --> 01:05:33.813
﻿Fuck you! Fuck all of you!
﻿My son is dead!

01:05:52.855 --> 01:05:55.694
﻿When... when I saw Oliver.

01:05:57.735 --> 01:05:59.454
﻿I knew I had to deal with it myself

01:06:03.695 --> 01:06:06.854
﻿I just wanted to close that door
﻿and take care of it all.

01:06:17.216 --> 01:06:19.694
﻿I just wanted to help Iben,
﻿but...

01:06:24.735 --> 01:06:26.334
﻿What are you doing?

01:06:30.375 --> 01:06:32.815
﻿I'm going home to Mathilde.
﻿I should never have left.

01:06:33.895 --> 01:06:35.094
﻿The police are with her.

01:06:40.536 --> 01:06:41.774
﻿I told her not to go in there.

01:07:01.015 --> 01:07:02.855
﻿I'm leaving now.
﻿What about Iben?

01:07:03.935 --> 01:07:04.975
﻿I don't know where she is.

01:07:06.536 --> 01:07:08.095
﻿Do you think
﻿she could harm herself?

01:07:10.576 --> 01:07:16.015
﻿Now listen to me.
﻿She has no idea what she's done.

01:07:18.936 --> 01:07:23.616
﻿She thinks.
﻿she thinks she helped Oliver.

01:07:26.376 --> 01:07:27.757
﻿I didn't have the heart to tell her.

01:07:30.296 --> 01:07:31.095
﻿No.

01:07:33.496 --> 01:07:34.335
﻿No.

01:08:16.417 --> 01:08:20.576
﻿This is Iben Østergård.
﻿I can't come to the phone right now

01:08:20.777 --> 01:08:27.376
﻿so... stop it! Leave a message,
﻿call later or send a text. Bye.

01:09:38.698 --> 01:09:41.457
﻿Hello? ﻿Hi, Rashid.

01:09:42.578 --> 01:09:44.136
﻿Did you find them? ﻿Yes.

01:09:44.897 --> 01:09:45.698
﻿That's good.

01:09:49.697 --> 01:09:51.256
﻿Are you at home? ﻿No.

01:09:51.858 --> 01:09:53.017
﻿I'm in my car.

01:09:54.098 --> 01:09:55.365
﻿I thought
﻿you might need me again.

01:09:55.458 --> 01:09:57.017
﻿Go home.

01:10:00.218 --> 01:10:02.577
﻿What was he doing with her.
﻿Just go home, Rashid.

01:10:06.219 --> 01:10:07.057
﻿Okay.
