WEBVTT

00:01.449 --> 00:03.382
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:03.520 --> 00:06.420
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:06.558 --> 00:10.941
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:11.080 --> 00:13.875
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:14.014 --> 00:16.982
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:17.120 --> 00:20.744
We finally got
a piece of the pie

00:22.608 --> 00:25.094
Fish don't fry
in the kitchen

00:25.232 --> 00:27.786
Beans don't burn
on the grill

00:27.924 --> 00:30.271
Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:30.409 --> 00:33.033
Just to get up that hill

00:33.171 --> 00:35.552
Now we're up
in the big leagues

00:35.690 --> 00:38.141
Gettin' our turn at bat

00:38.279 --> 00:40.626
As long as we live,
it's you and me, baby

00:40.764 --> 00:42.352
There ain't nothin' wrong
with that

00:42.490 --> 00:45.114
We're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:45.252 --> 00:48.255
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:48.393 --> 00:52.742
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:52.880 --> 00:55.607
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:55.745 --> 00:58.610
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:58.748 --> 01:04.650
We finally got
a piece of the pie

01:07.860 --> 01:10.484
Oh, that's the way
Uh-huh, uh-huh

01:10.622 --> 01:13.314
I like it
Uh-huh, uh-huh

01:13.452 --> 01:15.489
That's the way
Uh-huh, uh-huh

01:15.627 --> 01:17.594
I like it
Uh-huh, uh-huh

01:18.354 --> 01:20.390
Now, your friend Willie

01:20.528 --> 01:22.427
was the one with
the red sports coat,

01:22.565 --> 01:24.118
am I right?
No, that was Zippy.

01:24.256 --> 01:25.878
Willie's the one
with the two chicks.

01:26.016 --> 01:27.328
Uh-huh, uh-huh

01:27.466 --> 01:29.468
That's the way
Uh-huh, uh-huh

01:29.606 --> 01:31.677
I like it
Uh-huh, uh-huh

01:31.815 --> 01:32.747
That's the way

01:32.885 --> 01:34.059
Florence.

01:34.197 --> 01:36.130
I like it
Uh-huh, uh-huh

01:36.268 --> 01:37.338
Florence!

01:37.476 --> 01:39.099
That's the way
Uh-huh, uh-huh

01:39.237 --> 01:40.997
Hey! Damn it.

01:41.135 --> 01:42.516
That's the way...

01:46.209 --> 01:47.486
What you do that for,
Mr. Jefferson?

01:47.624 --> 01:50.179
Because that's the way
I like it, uh-huh, uh-huh!

01:53.147 --> 01:54.976
Is he in one of his
moods again?

01:55.115 --> 01:56.633
If you'd just
come from a funeral,

01:56.771 --> 01:58.118
wouldn't you feel low?

01:58.256 --> 02:00.361
Uh-uh, not me.
Any funeral I can
walk away from

02:00.499 --> 02:02.018
makes me feel good.

02:05.194 --> 02:06.574
How was your
friend's funeral?

02:06.712 --> 02:08.645
Terrible. It wasn't
fit for an enemy.

02:08.783 --> 02:11.407
You should have seen
the casket they buried
my man Steamy in.

02:11.545 --> 02:14.444
Looked like some kids
made it in wood shop.

02:14.582 --> 02:17.206
I know all the pallbearers
got splinters in their hands.

02:18.448 --> 02:20.001
Oh, don't worry,
Mr. Jefferson.

02:20.140 --> 02:22.935
The good lord
don't keep the boxes,
just the people.

02:24.834 --> 02:27.112
I wish I had known
how bad off Steamy was.
I could've helped him.

02:27.250 --> 02:29.252
I mean, I could have
given him some money,
found him a Job.

02:29.390 --> 02:30.529
How could you
have known?

02:30.667 --> 02:32.807
You haven't seen
each other for years.

02:32.945 --> 02:34.947
I should've kept
in touch to know.

02:35.085 --> 02:37.778
I mean, we grew up together.
We were the best of friends.

02:37.916 --> 02:38.951
I mean, It seems
like just yesterday

02:39.089 --> 02:41.368
me and him
and the rest of
the Seven Saints

02:41.506 --> 02:43.991
was running all around Harlem
having a good time.

02:44.129 --> 02:46.338
The Seven Saints?

02:46.476 --> 02:48.927
That was the name
of George's gang.

02:50.653 --> 02:52.275
Why'd you all
call yourself that?

02:52.413 --> 02:54.415
Jo Jo thought up the name.
He was our leader.

02:54.553 --> 02:58.108
It was me, Jo Jo,
Willie, Fats, Steamy,
Zippy and Gabby.

02:59.455 --> 03:01.698
Sounds more like
the seven dwarfs!

03:04.529 --> 03:06.841
I was just trying
to cheer you up.

03:06.979 --> 03:09.016
Well, if you want
to cheer me up,
try some magic.

03:09.154 --> 03:10.120
What kind of magic?

03:10.259 --> 03:11.432
Disappear!

03:13.331 --> 03:16.057
I don't need
no magic to know
which dwarf you was...

03:16.196 --> 03:17.404
Grumpy!

03:19.337 --> 03:20.855
See, now, her funeral
ain't gonna be cheap,

03:20.993 --> 03:22.754
because she gonna
need two caskets.

03:22.892 --> 03:24.342
One for her and one
for her mouth.

03:26.102 --> 03:27.276
I'll fix you
a drink, George.

03:27.414 --> 03:28.898
It'll make you
feel better.

03:29.036 --> 03:30.762
Yeah, make it
a double, Weezy.

03:30.900 --> 03:33.282
I want something
to stop me from
feeling so guilty.

03:33.420 --> 03:35.111
What have you got
to feel guilty about?

03:35.249 --> 03:36.871
Because I should've
kept in touch with those guys.

03:37.009 --> 03:38.459
I mean, after all,
we grew up together,

03:38.597 --> 03:40.047
we played together,
we fought together,

03:40.185 --> 03:41.462
we got in
trouble together.

03:41.600 --> 03:42.946
I mean, even in school,

03:43.084 --> 03:44.741
we used to drive
all the teachers
crazy together.

03:44.879 --> 03:47.434
When one of us
went to the bathroom,
we all had to go.

03:49.781 --> 03:51.576
You shouldn't
take all the blame.

03:51.714 --> 03:53.371
Why didn't they
get in touch with you?

03:53.509 --> 03:55.890
Well, they was
busy scratching up
bucks just like me.

03:56.305 --> 03:58.548
Thanks. Mmm.

03:58.686 --> 04:00.240
Now they probably think
I'm snubbing them.

04:00.378 --> 04:02.932
They think because I'm rich
it's going to my head.

04:03.070 --> 04:06.246
You know something, Weezy?
Maybe they're right.

04:06.384 --> 04:08.593
Now, George,
you are talking silly.

04:08.731 --> 04:10.077
Florence!

04:10.733 --> 04:12.010
Yeah?

04:12.148 --> 04:13.598
You want
to get the door?

04:13.736 --> 04:15.185
No, that's all right,
Mr. Jefferson.
You can get it.

04:20.639 --> 04:22.917
She got more nerve
than a bad tooth.

04:25.265 --> 04:28.129
Hello, Mr. J.

04:28.854 --> 04:29.993
Who is it, George?

04:30.131 --> 04:32.410
Some Eskimo that
talks like Bentley.

04:33.721 --> 04:34.998
Hi, Mr. J.

04:35.136 --> 04:36.586
May I trouble you
for a moment?

04:36.724 --> 04:38.968
Why stop now? You've been
troubling me for years.

04:40.038 --> 04:41.971
Don't mind him,
Mr. Bentley. Come in.

04:42.109 --> 04:44.214
Thank you.
What can we do for you?

04:44.353 --> 04:46.803
I was wondering if you
would watch my apartment.

04:46.941 --> 04:48.909
Why, what's
it gonna do?

04:49.530 --> 04:51.291
I say, that's crisp.

04:51.429 --> 04:53.293
Actually, I'm going
camping for a week,

04:53.431 --> 04:56.192
and I was hoping
you'd take in my
newspapers and my mail.

04:56.330 --> 04:57.918
Oh, we'll be very glad to.

04:58.056 --> 05:00.472
Thank you.
You going camping
dressed like that?

05:00.610 --> 05:02.888
You're gonna get
arrested for scaring
all the wild animals.

05:04.062 --> 05:06.513
It's going to be very cold
this time of the year.

05:06.651 --> 05:07.721
Yes, I know,

05:07.859 --> 05:09.688
so I'm taking something
with me to keep me warm.

05:09.826 --> 05:11.000
What are you taking,
plenty of booze?

05:11.138 --> 05:13.209
No, plenty of Cynthia.

05:16.246 --> 05:19.042
Oh. Is that your
new girlfriend?

05:19.180 --> 05:21.666
Oh, Cynthia's much more
than a girlfriend, Mrs. J.

05:21.804 --> 05:23.253
She's a sport!

05:23.392 --> 05:24.841
We're going to have
a marvelous time

05:24.979 --> 05:26.567
roughing it in the
great outdoors.

05:27.706 --> 05:30.260
It'll be just like
the old boy scout days.

05:31.089 --> 05:33.747
Cynthia was a boy scout?

05:33.885 --> 05:34.989
Oh, no, she's all girl,

05:35.127 --> 05:36.750
but I'll teach her
some of the old tricks.

05:36.888 --> 05:40.719
Oh!
You a sly old dog,
Bentley!

05:40.857 --> 05:43.446
Oh, no, I mean things
like rubbing sticks
together...

05:43.584 --> 05:44.723
Sure!

05:44.861 --> 05:46.553
And boiling up the snow
for shaving water.

05:46.691 --> 05:48.244
Uh-huh.

05:48.382 --> 05:51.109
Cynthia is gonna love that.

05:51.247 --> 05:53.491
Yes, she will, won't she?

05:53.629 --> 05:55.734
I didn't know you had
boy scouts in England.

05:55.872 --> 05:57.840
Oh, that's where
they came from
in the first place.

05:57.978 --> 05:59.600
That's where all
the nuts come from.

06:00.877 --> 06:02.258
No, I think that's Brazil.

06:02.396 --> 06:05.917
England is more
leather goods and
boy scouts.

06:06.055 --> 06:07.194
As a matter of fact,

06:07.332 --> 06:09.610
the boy scouts were founded
by Lord Baden Powell.

06:09.748 --> 06:12.302
What a man he was.
A magnificent leader.

06:12.441 --> 06:14.270
Were you ever
a boy scout, Mr. J?

06:14.408 --> 06:15.927
What? Are you kidding?

06:16.065 --> 06:17.791
In my neighborhood,
you couldn't survive
walking two blocks

06:17.929 --> 06:19.724
with that
funny-looking uniform.

06:20.759 --> 06:22.312
What a shame
you missed out
on all of that.

06:22.451 --> 06:23.555
If you're talking
about leaders,

06:23.693 --> 06:24.798
I bet your
Baden Powell

06:24.936 --> 06:27.214
didn't have nothing
on our Jo Jo Johnson.

06:27.352 --> 06:29.768
What did Jo Jo
Johnson lead?

06:29.906 --> 06:31.460
Us! The Saints.

06:31.598 --> 06:32.737
I remember
the time old Gabby

06:32.875 --> 06:34.670
ripped a phone right off
the drugstore wall.

06:37.776 --> 06:39.226
What for?

06:39.364 --> 06:41.331
'Cause the phone
gypped Jo Jo
out of a nickel.

06:43.989 --> 06:46.095
So why did Gabby rip it off?

06:46.233 --> 06:48.442
'Cause Jo Jo told him to.
He was the leader.

06:49.374 --> 06:52.757
Yeah, he kept
leading you
into trouble.

06:52.895 --> 06:55.069
I still think you'd
have had more fun
as a boy scout.

06:55.207 --> 06:57.969
Do you know
to this very day I've got
the merit badges I won

06:58.107 --> 07:00.661
for camping,
first aid, survival?

07:00.799 --> 07:03.423
I got a merit badge
for survival too, Bentley.

07:03.561 --> 07:04.700
Oh, you have?

07:04.838 --> 07:07.081
That's right. Right there.
I got it when I was a kid.

07:07.219 --> 07:09.049
Oh, I say, that's
quite a pimple.

07:09.187 --> 07:10.360
Not the pimple!

07:12.362 --> 07:14.019
The scar next to it.

07:14.157 --> 07:15.711
What, that little
scratch mark?

07:17.609 --> 07:19.646
Yeah, well,
it was a lot bigger
when I was smaller.

07:20.957 --> 07:22.718
You used to be smaller?

07:28.724 --> 07:30.933
He wasn't really smaller.

07:31.071 --> 07:32.313
He just looked that way

07:32.452 --> 07:34.902
because he was always
ducking his daddy's punches.

07:36.145 --> 07:37.698
I got this scar one day

07:37.836 --> 07:40.080
when me and Jo Jo
and Steamy was walking
down the street

07:40.218 --> 07:41.530
and these three
dudes jumped us.

07:41.668 --> 07:42.841
We gave them
a hard way to go,

07:42.979 --> 07:44.567
even though
we was outnumbered.

07:44.705 --> 07:46.914
Outnumbered?
It was three
against three.

07:47.052 --> 07:48.571
No, Weezy, it was
two against three

07:48.709 --> 07:50.262
because Jo Jo
ran to get help.

07:52.679 --> 07:54.957
If Jo Jo was
such a great leader,

07:55.095 --> 07:56.545
why didn't you follow him?

07:56.683 --> 07:57.994
Because he told us
to stay.

07:58.719 --> 07:59.858
Where was I?
Oh, yeah.

07:59.996 --> 08:01.619
So one of these dudes
hit me from behind

08:01.757 --> 08:03.655
and knocked me out cold,
so when I come to,

08:03.793 --> 08:05.657
I see my man Steamy
laying right there
beside me.

08:05.795 --> 08:07.107
So I picked him up,
threw him across
my shoulder

08:07.245 --> 08:08.695
and carried him on home.

08:08.833 --> 08:11.145
He can thank
his lucky stars he
had you for a friend.

08:11.283 --> 08:13.044
No, he can't. He's dead.

08:13.182 --> 08:14.942
Oh, I'm sorry.

08:15.080 --> 08:17.151
We just came back
from his funeral.

08:17.289 --> 08:20.051
Poor chap. Had he
been in a coma
all these years?

08:25.435 --> 08:27.230
Steamy was hit by a car.

08:28.128 --> 08:30.061
While you were
carrying him home?

08:32.650 --> 08:35.238
Bentley, why don't you
go pitch your tent?

08:36.412 --> 08:39.035
By Jove, you're right.
Tempus fugit.

08:39.173 --> 08:41.244
I've still got to
pick up some supplies.

08:41.382 --> 08:43.799
Let's see, I need batteries
for my portable hi-fi,

08:43.937 --> 08:46.767
and some disposable cups
for the champagne.

08:46.905 --> 08:49.183
I thought you was
going to be roughing it.

08:49.321 --> 08:51.738
Oh, I am,
but you know the old
boy scout motto:

08:51.876 --> 08:53.015
"Be prepared."

08:53.153 --> 08:54.395
Woof!

08:55.983 --> 08:57.088
If you don't mind,
Mrs. Jefferson,

08:57.226 --> 08:58.710
I'm going to be
calling it a day.

08:58.848 --> 09:02.024
It's only 2:00!
I call it a half a day.

09:02.162 --> 09:04.820
Florence is going to her
high school reunion.

09:04.958 --> 09:06.615
I gave her permission
to take off early.

09:07.443 --> 09:10.066
Florence! You're a genius!

09:10.204 --> 09:11.171
What?

09:11.309 --> 09:12.379
What are you talking about?

09:12.517 --> 09:14.415
Don't you get it,
Weezy? A reunion!

09:14.554 --> 09:15.693
She's going to a reunion.

09:15.831 --> 09:17.936
That's what I'll have.
A reunion of the Saints.

09:18.074 --> 09:19.455
I'll invite them
all up here

09:19.593 --> 09:22.078
so that they can
see that I am still
the same old Squeaky.

09:22.216 --> 09:23.286
Squeaky?

09:23.424 --> 09:24.805
That was my club name.

09:24.943 --> 09:26.496
Why did they
call you that?

09:26.635 --> 09:28.291
Well, when I was a kid,
my voice was changing.

09:28.429 --> 09:30.017
When I talked,
funny things came out.

09:30.673 --> 09:31.985
They still do.

09:34.677 --> 09:36.506
Bye, Squeaky.

09:40.614 --> 09:42.823
Oh, when the saints
go marching in

09:42.961 --> 09:47.241
Oh, when the saints
go marching in

09:47.379 --> 09:49.416
Hey, Weezy, do you
think there's gonna
be enough sandwiches?

09:49.554 --> 09:51.867
More than enough.
Are you sure?

09:52.005 --> 09:54.248
George, you're only
feeding five guys,

09:54.386 --> 09:56.147
not pharaoh's army.

09:56.285 --> 09:57.735
Three guys.

09:57.873 --> 09:59.737
Fats has
been dead for years,
and zippy can't make it.

09:59.875 --> 10:01.601
Oh, that's too bad.

10:01.739 --> 10:03.603
No, it's still
going to be a
great party, though.

10:03.741 --> 10:05.328
Too bad you're
gonna have to miss it.

10:05.466 --> 10:06.916
What do you mean?
I'm not going anyplace.

10:07.054 --> 10:08.297
Oh, yes, you are.

10:09.332 --> 10:10.610
I'm gonna introduce
you to the guys,

10:10.748 --> 10:11.818
then I want you to say
you got a headache

10:11.956 --> 10:13.785
and then you'll just
get rid of yourself.

10:16.201 --> 10:17.651
Why?

10:17.789 --> 10:19.342
Because it's gonna
be stag, Weezy.

10:19.480 --> 10:21.862
You don't want to
sit around listening
to man-talk all night.

10:22.000 --> 10:23.139
You're right.

10:23.277 --> 10:27.005
I'd rather do something
interesting instead.

10:27.143 --> 10:29.559
Oh, man, I can't wait
to see my man Jo Jo
again.

10:29.698 --> 10:30.664
Why him especially?

10:30.802 --> 10:32.424
Like I told you,
he was our leader.

10:32.562 --> 10:34.910
When Jo Jo said,
"jump," We jumped.

10:35.048 --> 10:37.809
George, that was
a long time ago.

10:37.947 --> 10:39.328
You were just
a bunch of kids.

10:39.466 --> 10:41.157
Yeah, I know.
Ain't life strange,
though?

10:41.295 --> 10:43.159
I mean, like, Jo Jo
was always on the top,

10:43.297 --> 10:44.367
and I was always
on the bottom.

10:44.505 --> 10:46.576
Now he's got some
jive-time little Job,

10:46.715 --> 10:48.026
and I'm way up here.

10:48.164 --> 10:50.201
Now I give the orders.

10:50.339 --> 10:52.237
Is that why you want
to see him again?

10:52.375 --> 10:53.514
No, Weezy,
of course not.

10:53.653 --> 10:55.171
I just want to show him
I'm a real friend,

10:55.309 --> 10:56.759
pass on some
of my know-how,

10:56.897 --> 10:58.623
teach him how to
make it in business
like I did.

10:59.797 --> 11:00.901
Here's some
hors d'oeuvres.

11:02.489 --> 11:05.181
That's them. You get it.
I'll take that.

11:05.319 --> 11:07.045
Anything you
say, Squeaky.

11:08.426 --> 11:10.497
And you be more respectful
in front of my friends!

11:13.051 --> 11:15.226
Yes, sir...Squeaky!

11:20.093 --> 11:21.197
Hi.

11:21.922 --> 11:24.822
Wow! Am I glad
to see you!

11:26.927 --> 11:28.101
Why? I ain't
Mr. Jefferson.

11:28.239 --> 11:30.655
That's exactly
what I mean.

11:30.793 --> 11:32.726
Oh! Mmm!

11:32.864 --> 11:35.660
Hey! Gabby! Hey!

11:36.488 --> 11:37.489
Hey!

11:37.627 --> 11:39.940
Gabby, still
hitting hard?

11:40.078 --> 11:41.459
Yeah.

11:41.597 --> 11:44.289
Gabby, you old turkey, man,
you ain't changed in 25 years.

11:44.427 --> 11:46.188
Oh, look, this is
my wife, Louise.

11:46.326 --> 11:47.396
Louise, this is Gabby,

11:47.534 --> 11:48.949
one of the nicest dudes
you'd ever want to meet.

11:49.087 --> 11:51.089
Hi, Gabby.
Nice to meet you.

11:51.227 --> 11:52.988
George has told me
so much about you.

11:53.126 --> 11:54.679
Hi.

11:54.817 --> 11:57.371
And this is Willie.

11:58.269 --> 11:59.788
Willie? Willie?

11:59.926 --> 12:02.342
Yeah.
Hey, man, I want you
to meet my wife.

12:02.480 --> 12:04.862
Later. I'm still
meeting your maid.

12:08.658 --> 12:11.869
Um, tell me,
why did they
call you Gabby?

12:12.421 --> 12:13.560
Because.

12:16.632 --> 12:18.945
Jo Jo!
Squeaky!

12:21.430 --> 12:22.569
Good to see
you, man!

12:22.707 --> 12:24.674
Hey, Louise,
this is Jo Jo.

12:24.813 --> 12:26.124
He used to be
our leader.

12:26.262 --> 12:28.955
How do you do?
Pleased to meet
you, Louise.

12:29.093 --> 12:31.371
How'd you get
stuck with somebody
ugly like Squeaky?

12:33.925 --> 12:35.755
Oh, just lucky,
I guess.

12:37.411 --> 12:39.828
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I have some things to do.

12:39.966 --> 12:42.727
Oh, don't go,
Louise. Stay.

12:42.865 --> 12:45.557
Oh, thank you,
but George told me
he didn't...

12:45.695 --> 12:47.801
Hey, Weezy, didn't
you hear Jo Jo?

12:47.939 --> 12:50.183
If he says,
"stay," you stay.

13:01.194 --> 13:02.989
Hey, take a look
at this picture, Weez.

13:04.818 --> 13:06.958
George! What happened
to your hair?

13:08.546 --> 13:10.997
Oh, that was the year
we all shaved our heads.

13:11.135 --> 13:12.412
Why?

13:12.550 --> 13:14.138
Because
I told them to.

13:15.760 --> 13:19.143
Yeah! Jo Jo said
it would make our
faces look meaner.

13:19.281 --> 13:20.661
Well, I don't know
about that.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.078
But it sure makes
your ears look bigger.

13:26.391 --> 13:27.807
Well, here's
some more eats.

13:29.981 --> 13:31.396
You better
cut that out, boy.

13:32.915 --> 13:34.883
Boy? Boy?

13:35.021 --> 13:37.230
I don't see no boy
in this room, mama.

13:38.818 --> 13:41.061
That's because you ain't
looking in no mirror.

13:42.545 --> 13:45.134
All I see is a woman
who needs a...man.

13:49.829 --> 13:52.832
Then why don't you
go out and find me one?

13:57.353 --> 13:58.803
Oh, come on, girl.

13:58.941 --> 14:01.185
You touch me, boy,
you going to draw
back a nub.

14:03.221 --> 14:05.085
Hey! How about
a toast?

14:05.223 --> 14:06.155
I'll buy that.

14:07.329 --> 14:09.158
Here's to
the Saints...
Hold it,
Squeaky.

14:09.296 --> 14:10.228
Ain't you
forgetting something?

14:10.366 --> 14:11.436
No. What?

14:11.574 --> 14:12.713
Now I do the toasting
for the saints.

14:12.852 --> 14:13.922
Yeah, well,
I thought that, uh...

14:14.060 --> 14:16.027
And I do the
thinking too, right?

14:16.165 --> 14:17.235
Right.

14:17.373 --> 14:18.581
Okay.

14:20.307 --> 14:21.377
Here's to
the Saints.

14:21.515 --> 14:23.172
ALL: Yay!

14:25.002 --> 14:26.175
Who under
my leadership

14:26.313 --> 14:28.246
were some of
the baddest dudes

14:28.384 --> 14:30.007
that ever hit
the streets of Harlem.

14:30.145 --> 14:31.215
All right!

14:32.285 --> 14:33.458
Hey!

14:33.596 --> 14:35.288
And to show you how much
those days mean to me

14:35.426 --> 14:37.117
and that I ain't forgotten
none of my old buddies,

14:37.255 --> 14:38.394
from here on in,

14:38.532 --> 14:39.879
we are going to meet
here in my place

14:40.017 --> 14:41.535
every first Sunday
of the month.

14:41.673 --> 14:43.468
Right on,
Squeaky.

14:43.606 --> 14:45.539
What do you think
of my idea, Gabby?
Fine.

14:45.677 --> 14:46.678
Jo Jo?

14:46.816 --> 14:48.335
It's a great idea,
Squeaky.

14:48.473 --> 14:49.440
Thank you, Jo Jo.

14:49.578 --> 14:50.959
But I got
a better one.

14:52.719 --> 14:55.101
Instead of meeting Sundays,
we meet the first Saturday.

14:55.239 --> 14:56.654
That way, we don't
have to get up early

14:56.792 --> 14:58.311
the next
morning, right?

14:58.449 --> 15:00.969
But sometimes George
works on Saturdays.

15:01.107 --> 15:03.109
Well, he's
his own boss.

15:03.247 --> 15:05.559
He can give himself
a day off.

15:07.044 --> 15:08.804
Look, don't try to argue
with Jo Jo, Weezy.

15:08.942 --> 15:11.427
He's got a mind
like a steel trap.

15:11.565 --> 15:13.947
And I think he's
caught himself a mouse.

15:15.259 --> 15:17.571
But you know what
I think we could do
at these meetings?

15:17.709 --> 15:20.367
How'd you guys
like to make some extra
dough for yourselves?

15:20.505 --> 15:22.956
Hey! I'd like that.
Oh, George, I'd like
that very much.

15:23.094 --> 15:24.337
I'd like to make
a whole lot of money.

15:31.516 --> 15:33.933
He ain't said
that many words
in 25 years.

15:36.038 --> 15:38.213
Well, as you can see,
I have done pretty
good for myself.

15:38.351 --> 15:39.559
So I thought I could
give you guys

15:39.697 --> 15:41.112
the benefit of my
business know-how.

15:41.250 --> 15:42.251
Like for instance,
if you wanna make...

15:42.389 --> 15:43.701
Squeaky, we didn't
come here for no lectures.

15:43.839 --> 15:45.116
Huh?

15:45.254 --> 15:47.636
We are the Saints,
and we came here
to have a good time.

15:47.774 --> 15:48.775
You know
what I mean?

15:48.913 --> 15:50.156
Like the time
when Fats hit you

15:50.294 --> 15:51.812
in the stomach
with a pool stick.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.539
And broke it
half in two.

15:56.852 --> 16:00.304
George, why did Fats
hit you in the stomach
with a pool stick?

16:00.442 --> 16:01.961
Because Jo Jo
told him to.

16:03.824 --> 16:05.378
You told him to?

16:05.516 --> 16:06.620
It didn't hurt him.

16:06.758 --> 16:09.313
He had the hardest stomach
in the neighborhood.

16:09.451 --> 16:10.935
You still got
a hard stomach,
Squeak?

16:11.073 --> 16:12.247
Well...

16:12.385 --> 16:15.629
Let's see
if that belly is still
as hard as a rock.

16:16.354 --> 16:17.493
I don't know,
Jo Jo...

16:17.631 --> 16:18.563
You ain't scared,
are you?

16:18.701 --> 16:20.738
Me? No. Shh!

16:20.876 --> 16:23.603
All right, Gabby.
Take your best shot.

16:23.741 --> 16:25.329
Just wait
a minute!

16:27.779 --> 16:29.919
George, I want
to see you in
the kitchen.

16:30.058 --> 16:32.681
That is,
if it's all right
with Jo Jo.

16:32.819 --> 16:35.097
Sure. Just don't
take too long.

16:36.823 --> 16:38.825
Thank you.

16:38.963 --> 16:40.309
Look, I'll be right
back in a minute.

16:40.447 --> 16:42.001
Just help yourselves
to anything you want.

16:44.486 --> 16:46.522
Uh, what I want
is coming straight
at me.

16:49.353 --> 16:50.526
What's gotten
into you?

16:50.664 --> 16:52.114
Nothing.

16:52.252 --> 16:54.979
Were you actually going
to let that man hit you
in the stomach?

16:55.117 --> 16:56.912
He wouldn't have
hit me hard.

16:57.050 --> 16:58.845
George, you're
a grown man now,

16:58.983 --> 17:00.433
not some kid in a gang.

17:01.261 --> 17:02.435
Don't you feel silly

17:02.573 --> 17:04.782
letting somebody push you
around like that?

17:04.920 --> 17:07.371
Look, I don't need you
telling me that I'm
a grown man.

17:07.509 --> 17:08.820
I don't let nobody
push me around.

17:08.958 --> 17:09.994
Nobody!

17:10.132 --> 17:11.961
JO JO: Hey, Squeaky!
We need more champagne.

17:12.100 --> 17:13.584
Coming, Jo Jo!

17:21.523 --> 17:22.938
Will you
cut it out!

17:23.076 --> 17:25.147
You're worse
than a wasp
at a weenie roast.

17:27.563 --> 17:29.979
Come on, mama,
don't fight
your feelings.

17:30.118 --> 17:32.637
You and me got to
get it together.

17:32.775 --> 17:36.400
In a minute, my fist
is going to get together
with your nose.

17:37.711 --> 17:39.265
Look here, mama.

17:39.403 --> 17:41.543
I got two tickets for
the basketball game
tomorrow night.

17:41.681 --> 17:42.613
You like basketball?

17:42.751 --> 17:44.097
No. I like baseball.

17:45.305 --> 17:46.651
What you know
about baseball?

17:46.789 --> 17:47.859
A lot!

17:47.997 --> 17:50.172
I went to see my friend
play a game yesterday.

17:50.310 --> 17:52.899
And my friend hit
a grand-slam home run.

17:53.037 --> 17:55.557
Mmm! Three men
on base, huh?

17:55.695 --> 17:58.007
Wasn't no
men on base.
No men on base?

17:58.146 --> 18:00.665
I thought you said
your friend hit a
grand-slam home run.

18:00.803 --> 18:02.184
I did.

18:02.322 --> 18:03.599
Well, you don't
know much about
baseball, then,

18:03.737 --> 18:06.154
because you can't hit
no grand-slam home run

18:06.292 --> 18:08.121
unless there's
three men on base.

18:08.259 --> 18:09.709
You want to make
a bet on that?

18:09.847 --> 18:11.504
A bet?
Ah ha-ha.

18:11.642 --> 18:13.989
Sure, mama, I'll make
a bet on that.

18:14.921 --> 18:16.267
Look here,
I tell you what.

18:16.957 --> 18:18.476
I got $20 here.

18:18.614 --> 18:20.375
If you right,
it's yours.

18:20.513 --> 18:21.583
But if
you wrong,

18:21.721 --> 18:22.894
it's me and you...

18:25.897 --> 18:26.933
Deal?

18:27.071 --> 18:28.141
Deal.

18:28.279 --> 18:29.798
Look here, Jo Jo.

18:29.936 --> 18:33.181
This fine, foxy lady here
says she got a friend

18:33.319 --> 18:35.838
who hit a grand-slam
home run

18:35.976 --> 18:38.047
and wasn't nobody
on base.

18:38.186 --> 18:39.566
Now, is that possible?

18:40.119 --> 18:41.603
No way.

18:41.741 --> 18:43.225
You see what I mean,
pretty mama?

18:43.363 --> 18:45.158
There wasn't
no men on base

18:45.296 --> 18:48.196
because it was a
women's baseball game.

18:56.721 --> 18:58.067
Hey, Squeaky.

18:58.206 --> 18:59.483
This is really
great, Squeaky,

18:59.621 --> 19:01.761
having the Saints
back together again.

19:01.899 --> 19:03.763
Yeah, man.

19:03.901 --> 19:05.627
Too bad Zippy
couldn't make it,
though.

19:05.765 --> 19:07.146
Yeah, but Zippy's
changed.

19:07.698 --> 19:09.251
Changed how?

19:09.389 --> 19:11.460
Oh, zippy ain't
no real saint no more.
Gabby will tell you.

19:11.598 --> 19:13.359
He ain't no real saint
no more, is he, Gabby?

19:13.497 --> 19:14.463
No.

19:14.601 --> 19:15.637
No, he's not.

19:16.672 --> 19:18.053
No, he thinks
he's too important

19:18.191 --> 19:19.744
now that he's working
for the gas company.

19:21.367 --> 19:23.023
I saw him
a couple of weeks
back and I said,

19:23.162 --> 19:24.715
"Hey, Zippy.

19:24.853 --> 19:27.787
"Have you read any
good meters lately?"

19:27.925 --> 19:29.098
I thought
it was funny.

19:29.237 --> 19:30.583
Ain't it funny,
Gabby?

19:30.721 --> 19:31.860
Yeah.

19:33.655 --> 19:35.622
Zippy didn't think
it was funny.

19:35.760 --> 19:38.556
You know what?
He didn't even remember
our secret handshake.

19:38.694 --> 19:39.971
You jivin'?

19:40.109 --> 19:42.042
No! And when
I tried to teach him,
he said it was silly.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.182
I mean, silly!

19:43.734 --> 19:44.804
Poor Steamy.

19:44.942 --> 19:46.702
Too bad he had
to kick the bucket.

19:46.840 --> 19:49.084
Yeah, but he would
have got a bigger
kick out of this.

19:49.222 --> 19:52.329
Wait a minute!
I just got a great idea.

19:52.467 --> 19:54.779
Since old Steamy
can't come here
and Join us,

19:54.917 --> 19:56.505
we'll Join him.

19:57.679 --> 19:59.198
You mean
kill ourselves?

20:00.613 --> 20:02.201
No. That's not
what I mean, Squeaky.

20:02.339 --> 20:04.030
Do I have to explain
everything to you?

20:04.168 --> 20:06.274
No, man, no. Okay,
what do you want
us to do?

20:06.412 --> 20:08.345
Well, the same thing
we did when Fats died.

20:08.483 --> 20:10.485
Remember what we did
when Fats died, Gabby?

20:10.623 --> 20:11.589
Cry?

20:11.727 --> 20:13.315
No!

20:13.453 --> 20:16.387
We went
and had a beer
on Fats' grave.

20:16.525 --> 20:18.424
Now we're going to go
down to the cemetery

20:18.562 --> 20:21.185
and have a drink
with old Steamy.

20:21.323 --> 20:22.393
What about
my party?

20:22.531 --> 20:24.775
Now we moving the party
to the cemetery.

20:24.913 --> 20:26.742
Let's go before
it gets too dark,

20:26.880 --> 20:28.882
because I don't want
you guys to get scared!

20:30.919 --> 20:32.990
You don't think Steamy
will mind us dropping in
without calling, do you?

20:33.128 --> 20:35.510
Are you kidding?
Are you kidding, man?

20:35.648 --> 20:37.546
We're going to raise
every ghost in the place.

20:37.684 --> 20:40.446
Nobody sleeps
when the Saints...

20:40.584 --> 20:42.275
ALL: ...go marching in.

20:43.966 --> 20:46.383
Oh, what's going on?
Is the party over?

20:46.521 --> 20:48.419
No, it's only
beginning, mama.

20:48.557 --> 20:50.007
We're going to
visit old Steamy

20:50.145 --> 20:52.975
and pour some wine
on his shrine.

20:53.113 --> 20:54.874
What?

20:55.012 --> 20:56.082
Its okay,
Weez.

20:56.220 --> 20:57.532
We're just going
down to the cemetery.

20:57.670 --> 20:58.740
Why?

20:58.878 --> 21:00.120
No, let me guess.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.502
Because Jo Jo
told you to.

21:03.331 --> 21:04.987
Look, Weezy,
it's all in fun.

21:05.125 --> 21:06.126
Fun?

21:06.265 --> 21:08.025
You hate cemeteries.

21:08.163 --> 21:09.923
Come on, Squeaky,
let's go.

21:10.061 --> 21:10.993
Well, while
you're out,

21:11.131 --> 21:12.995
I just hope Jo Jo
don't tell you

21:13.133 --> 21:14.894
to jump in front
of a subway train.

21:15.032 --> 21:16.102
Weezy.

21:16.827 --> 21:18.069
Hey, Jo Jo.

21:18.207 --> 21:20.071
Maybe it would be better
if we just stayed here.

21:20.209 --> 21:23.351
No! You want
to cheat old Steamy
out of his party?

21:23.489 --> 21:25.560
Old Steamy is dead!

21:25.698 --> 21:27.044
Don't make
no difference.

21:27.182 --> 21:29.909
He was always
the first one to
pass out, anyway.

21:31.428 --> 21:32.532
Look, Jo Jo.

21:32.670 --> 21:34.741
I don't want to go, man.
I hate cemeteries.

21:34.879 --> 21:36.640
That ain't the
real reason,
is it, Squeaky?

21:36.778 --> 21:39.746
You don't want
to go because your wife
don't want you to.

21:39.884 --> 21:41.438
No, no, no, no.
No, it ain't...

21:41.576 --> 21:42.922
Squeaky, ain't it
about time

21:43.060 --> 21:45.407
you stopped letting people
order you around?

21:46.719 --> 21:48.859
Yeah. You right.

21:48.997 --> 21:51.033
Now, that's
my Squeaky.

21:51.171 --> 21:53.760
Nobody tells me
what to do no more.

21:53.898 --> 21:56.280
Now, that's
my Squeaky.

21:57.454 --> 21:59.697
Hey, Gabby, can you
believe this?

21:59.835 --> 22:01.285
Squeaky don't
want to go down
to the graveyard

22:01.423 --> 22:04.081
because his dumb old lady
thinks it's a dumb idea.

22:04.875 --> 22:06.255
Can you
believe that?

22:06.980 --> 22:08.119
Yeah!

22:10.812 --> 22:12.779
Shut up, Gabby.
You talk too much,
anyway.

22:14.712 --> 22:16.438
Did you call
my old lady dumb?

22:18.337 --> 22:20.477
Yeah. She's
all wet, man.

22:29.037 --> 22:30.452
So are you, man.

22:31.488 --> 22:32.868
Just for that,

22:33.006 --> 22:34.629
you out of the gang.

22:43.948 --> 22:46.019
Don't let it
get you down,
George.

22:46.157 --> 22:48.194
Yeah, but I just
wanted it to be
like old times.

22:48.332 --> 22:50.127
It was like
old times.

22:50.265 --> 22:51.784
That's why zippy
didn't show up.

22:51.922 --> 22:52.923
Say what?

22:53.061 --> 22:54.165
I talked to him
on the phone.

22:54.303 --> 22:57.479
Zippy said, "Man,
the best way
to stay friends

22:57.617 --> 22:59.654
"was to stay away
from each other."

22:59.792 --> 23:02.001
Zippy sounds
pretty smart...

23:02.139 --> 23:03.347
For a Saint.

23:03.485 --> 23:05.280
You got to understand
old Jo Jo, that's all.

23:05.418 --> 23:06.523
JO JO: Come on, Willie!

23:06.661 --> 23:07.731
Coming,
Jo Jo.

23:07.869 --> 23:09.042
Louise, nice
seeing you.

23:09.180 --> 23:10.975
George,
be cool.

23:11.597 --> 23:12.598
Hey, Jo Jo!

23:19.363 --> 23:21.779
Yeah! See you
at the next reunion!

23:24.748 --> 23:26.750
"At the next reunion"?

23:26.888 --> 23:28.545
Sure.

23:28.683 --> 23:30.650
You're still
going to keep up
those reunions

23:30.788 --> 23:31.893
as a regular thing?

23:32.031 --> 23:33.032
Yeah, regular.

23:33.170 --> 23:34.965
Once every
50 years.

23:35.103 --> 23:36.518
Oh!

23:43.076 --> 23:44.353
Oh!

24:03.994 --> 24:07.756
LOUISE: The Jeffersons
was videotaped in front
of a studio audience.
