-From the beginning!
-[Kit] The beginning?

15:39.125 --> 15:42.417
You look awful, Kit, but you smell clean.

15:42.667 --> 15:45.583
Thanks, Bobbo. You're a real comfort.

15:45.667 --> 15:48.417
Kit, I'm going to arrange your escape.

15:48.500 --> 15:50.667
No. Thanks anyway, Bobbo.

15:50.750 --> 15:54.709
That would be giving up,
and I'm no quitter.

15:54.792 --> 15:57.667
But they're torturing you. You must leave.

15:57.750 --> 16:02.166
Oh, I will, but I'm not sneaking out,
I'm flying out.

16:02.250 --> 16:06.458
But first I'll show everybody
what a great pilot I am.

16:07.542 --> 16:10.291
[Baloo] Oh, I miss that kid, Louie.

16:10.667 --> 16:14.750
Don't worry, big fella. Kit's just got
to blow off a little steam.

16:14.834 --> 16:18.291
A little steam? He's been gone a week.

16:18.667 --> 16:21.959
All right. Then a lot of steam.
But he'll be back.

16:22.041 --> 16:25.458
I'm just worried about him
getting in a plane.

16:25.542 --> 16:29.291
Hey, Louie. Got a postcard for Mr. Baloo.

16:29.375 --> 16:30.625
That's me.

16:30.709 --> 16:35.625
"Flying in the air show.
Going to do a Baloo corkscrew.

16:35.709 --> 16:38.041
Wish you were here. Kit."

16:38.125 --> 16:40.041
He's going to do what?

16:40.125 --> 16:43.750
I've got to get him before he winds up
with his nose in the dirt.

16:57.500 --> 17:02.375
Everybody, say hi to the great ace pilot
Major Tiny Bubbles.

17:02.458 --> 17:03.750
[all] Hi.

17:08.500 --> 17:09.709
In your planes.

17:09.791 --> 17:14.583
Remember, start your engines,
but leave the flying to the grownup.

17:16.333 --> 17:19.541
[High Marshal] <i>Didn't those planes</i>
<i>look bigger in the catalog?</i>

17:19.625 --> 17:23.875
No, sir. They fit
our adult pilots perfectly, sir.

17:23.959 --> 17:26.040
So they do, Nozzle.

17:26.125 --> 17:28.875
I just better see
a perfectly-formed flounder.

17:28.959 --> 17:32.166
None of these planes
crashing int each other like last year.

17:32.750 --> 17:35.333
Are you really going
to go through with this, Kit?

17:35.458 --> 17:37.291
You bet your aileron.

17:37.750 --> 17:41.542
I'lm gonna do a Baloo corkscrew
and coast all the way home.

17:41.625 --> 17:43.375
Good luck, bunkmate Kit.

17:43.458 --> 17:45.375
Goodbye, bunkmate Bobbo.

18:02.667 --> 18:03.834
Kit!

18:05.166 --> 18:08.667
The Great Patriotic Flounder
is restricted from visitors.

18:08.750 --> 18:10.750
Looks like I'm going fishing.

18:18.792 --> 18:22.500
There it is, sir.
A perfectly-formed flounder.

18:42.417 --> 18:44.417
I'm on my way, Little Britches.

19:06.542 --> 19:07.792
[grunts]

19:07.875 --> 19:11.250
Come on... Come on...

19:11.375 --> 19:12.917
That ought to do it.

19:14.959 --> 19:16.375
It's showtime.

19:19.709 --> 19:22.625
[screaming]

19:22.709 --> 19:24.250
What is that?

19:24.333 --> 19:25.417
Well... [screams]

19:26.959 --> 19:28.709
A monkey wrench?

19:28.792 --> 19:30.375
No. That!

19:30.458 --> 19:33.000
The flounder lost its fin.

19:34.125 --> 19:36.834
This isn't supposed to happen.

19:38.250 --> 19:41.709
-Get that fish fin!
-Get that fish fin!

19:43.500 --> 19:46.458
Oh, man. This is harder than it looks.

19:48.375 --> 19:50.333
OK, keep her straight.

19:50.417 --> 19:52.250
Just keep her straight.

19:57.542 --> 19:59.834
Oh, no. I wish Baloo were here.

20:01.166 --> 20:03.417
Hang on. Papa Bear's coming.

20:06.166 --> 20:10.000
[soldier over radio] <i>You've desecrated</i>
<i>the head of our patriotic flounder.</i>

20:10.083 --> 20:11.583
Land and surrender.

20:11.667 --> 20:15.291
Sorry. You got to catch
this flying fish first.

20:17.208 --> 20:19.458
[soldier] <i>After our flounder-head!</i>

20:38.625 --> 20:41.500
It's not a perfectly-formed flounder?

20:41.583 --> 20:45.000
It is planes crashing into each other!

20:46.542 --> 20:47.417
Baloo!

20:52.458 --> 20:54.709
<i>Pick up the mike, Little Britches.</i>

20:55.875 --> 20:59.917
And just do what I tell you.
It's going to be all right.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.291
<i>Ease that wheel back.</i>

21:03.542 --> 21:05.041
I can't do it, Baloo.

21:05.125 --> 21:07.041
[Baloo] <i>Ease that wheel back.</i>

21:10.333 --> 21:12.375
<i>Pull back hard, Kit.</i>

21:12.500 --> 21:13.875
<i>Hard!</i>

21:20.208 --> 21:22.291
[Baloo] <i>You did it!</i>

21:22.375 --> 21:24.583
No, I didn't. You did.

21:24.667 --> 21:29.542
Oh, don't say that, Little Britches.
You'll be a great pilot.

21:29.625 --> 21:30.917
Yeah?

21:31.000 --> 21:32.542
You really think so?

21:32.750 --> 21:36.250
Sure, but do me a favor.

21:36.333 --> 21:38.166
Land so we could fly home.

21:38.250 --> 21:40.083
<i>Roger, Papa Bear.</i>

21:40.166 --> 21:44.000
Kit, I'll remember you
as the kid who flew.

21:44.583 --> 21:45.625
Sort of.

21:45.709 --> 21:47.208
Kids?

21:47.291 --> 21:49.959
You're not going to shoot me?

21:50.041 --> 21:52.291
I wouldn't waste the bullet.

21:52.458 --> 21:53.667
Ah...

21:53.750 --> 21:57.959
I have a crueler punishment
in store for you.

21:58.166 --> 22:00.083
[crying]

22:00.166 --> 22:02.291
That little brat.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.333
I hope I don't cut myself.
