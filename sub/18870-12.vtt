00:01.434 --> 00:03.103
<i>Previously on "Being Mary Jane"...</i>

00:03.169 --> 00:04.304
I broke up with Lee.

00:04.371 --> 00:07.574
We had sex.
We both agreed it was a mistake.

00:07.640 --> 00:09.809
Stop trying to produce
the show from your house.

00:09.876 --> 00:12.112
They fired you.
She'll get it if you don't watch.

00:12.178 --> 00:14.914
That director you had on the show,
he was asking about you.

00:14.981 --> 00:18.985
I'm not sure I wanna date a director
to improve my Q rating.

00:19.052 --> 00:20.520
I think it'll humanize you.

00:20.587 --> 00:22.122
<i>I tried it my way. It didn't work.</i>

00:22.188 --> 00:25.392
I can't stand the thought
of you with someone else.

00:25.458 --> 00:28.628
Common wisdom
says that this is a huge mistake.

00:28.695 --> 00:31.197
- Let's not be common.
- Justin.

00:40.206 --> 00:41.341
You're a snoozer.

00:42.475 --> 00:43.810
I never snooze.

00:45.812 --> 00:48.448
You're not a cuddler either, are you?

00:49.382 --> 00:50.950
I made you some coffee.

00:53.019 --> 00:54.587
Why are you so awake already?

00:55.355 --> 00:58.124
- I love this time of the morning.
- You mean night.

01:08.568 --> 01:09.803
Okay.

01:11.070 --> 01:12.138
You see?

01:14.174 --> 01:16.843
This is when the city is at its quietest.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.478
You can see it come alive.

01:18.545 --> 01:20.480
And when the sun comes up...

01:22.115 --> 01:23.716
you can see the light,

01:23.783 --> 01:26.085
and everything the light
touches can be yours.

01:29.022 --> 01:31.024
Did you just quote "The Lion King"?

01:32.625 --> 01:34.394
Okay, that's a great film.

01:35.128 --> 01:37.263
Okay, Mufasa.

01:38.331 --> 01:40.967
- Should we talk about...
- Hey, can you multitask?

01:41.034 --> 01:44.304
Yeah, 'cause your driver's
gonna be here in 20 minutes.

01:44.370 --> 01:46.539
So, are we riding in together or...

01:46.606 --> 01:50.376
No. We should arrive
at the studio separately.

01:50.443 --> 01:53.546
So this is how we start, in secrecy.

01:53.613 --> 01:56.282
For now, but it's not how it stays.

01:57.150 --> 01:59.452
And what is "this," exactly?

02:02.021 --> 02:03.990
It's all kind of fresh right now.

02:04.491 --> 02:06.392
I don't know if I can answer that yet.

02:11.331 --> 02:12.999
We need ground rules.

02:13.433 --> 02:14.968
I'll call you from the car.

02:17.804 --> 02:20.173
<i>Rule one: work comes first.</i>

02:20.240 --> 02:23.676
Agreed. Rule two:
no more distractions, no more mistakes.

02:23.743 --> 02:26.779
Definitely. Rule three:
we should be a united front

02:26.846 --> 02:29.315
on all decisions moving forward.

02:29.382 --> 02:31.251
I think that'll make us stronger.

02:31.317 --> 02:34.387
But we're gonna keep this a secret...

02:34.454 --> 02:36.489
from... everyone.

02:37.090 --> 02:38.157
For now.

02:38.224 --> 02:39.959
I take it that includes Kara.

02:40.026 --> 02:42.428
We're kind of on shaking
ground at work, so,

02:42.495 --> 02:44.831
<i>not a good time
to shake things up, right?</i>

02:44.898 --> 02:46.299
Right. So, we wait.

02:46.366 --> 02:49.269
- Are you gonna be okay with that?
- I guess I have to be, right?

02:49.335 --> 02:50.436
All right.

02:51.337 --> 02:54.107
<i>- Mary Jane...
- Yeah?</i>

02:55.341 --> 02:56.809
To answer your question...

02:57.644 --> 02:59.045
about what this is...

02:59.112 --> 03:00.513
<i>This is you and me.</i>

03:01.581 --> 03:03.116
<i>You and me, only.</i>

03:03.750 --> 03:07.754
Go all night and work
our asses off during the day,

03:07.820 --> 03:09.822
<i>dominating this news thing</i>

03:09.889 --> 03:13.426
until you're the top news anchor
in morning television

03:13.493 --> 03:15.328
and I'm your senior producer.

03:15.395 --> 03:17.163
You're already a senior producer.

03:17.230 --> 03:19.465
True, but I'll be "the" senior producer

03:19.532 --> 03:20.967
for "the" Mary Jane Paul

03:21.034 --> 03:23.770
<i>whose name and face
are on every billboard</i>

03:23.836 --> 03:25.638
<i>from Times Square to Los Angeles</i>

03:25.705 --> 03:26.906
<i>because I'm in your ear,</i>

03:26.973 --> 03:28.575
and I'll see those same billboards

03:28.641 --> 03:32.011
from my corner office 'cause...
'cause you have my back.

03:33.112 --> 03:35.648
Until everything
the light touches is ours.

03:36.616 --> 03:40.420
All I'm saying is we have each
other's back in all things.

03:40.486 --> 03:41.688
<i>That's what this is.</i>

03:42.455 --> 03:43.723
Okay.

03:44.657 --> 03:46.292
I still think we need a label.

03:46.926 --> 03:48.661
You really want me to say it?

03:48.728 --> 03:50.263
You know you want to.

03:50.330 --> 03:51.631
You're my girl.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.267
Are you happy?

03:55.902 --> 03:58.705
<i>You want me to update
my Facebook page now.</i>

04:00.173 --> 04:01.574
You have Facebook?

04:01.641 --> 04:03.443
Yeah, you didn't get my friend request?

04:05.211 --> 04:08.214
Did you hear about the changes
to the internet Insta-Star segment?

04:08.281 --> 04:09.449
No, what's going on?

04:09.515 --> 04:11.351
Aaron's got Marnie the Dog today,

04:11.417 --> 04:12.752
I'm doing CutiePie,

04:12.819 --> 04:15.021
and you're taking
Dani Hollins on Thursday.

04:15.588 --> 04:17.323
Wait, Mary Jane is interviewing Dani?

04:17.390 --> 04:19.659
She's got the most subscribers
of them all.

04:19.726 --> 04:21.594
You should be excited.

04:26.099 --> 04:27.266
Garrett?

04:28.501 --> 04:30.603
Why are they taking down
Natalie's poster?

04:30.670 --> 04:32.538
I've been meaning to tell you about that.

04:32.605 --> 04:33.673
She's out.

04:33.740 --> 04:35.675
I thought she was
on assignment in Topeka.

04:35.742 --> 04:38.444
Well, she was,
but the network decided to ax her.

04:38.511 --> 04:40.113
She wasn't testing well.

04:41.180 --> 04:44.484
- Have they found a replacement yet?
- Not yet. You got anybody in mind?

04:44.550 --> 04:46.919
- Yeah, I do.
- Yeah. Yeah, we do.

04:46.986 --> 04:49.956
The back-up correspondent
that we talked about

04:50.023 --> 04:51.724
- that would replace me.
- Yeah.

04:51.791 --> 04:53.893
- If Emma fell through.
- Yeah, I remember.

04:53.960 --> 04:56.129
Well, I'd be happy to take suggestions.

04:56.195 --> 05:00.266
We need opinions from all demographics.

05:02.335 --> 05:04.437
So, who's your pick?

05:04.504 --> 05:06.205
- Denise Gagne.
- Brendon Bragg.

05:06.272 --> 05:08.274
I need one pick you both like,

05:08.341 --> 05:10.677
and I need it in five minutes,
or you don't get a say.

05:10.743 --> 05:11.844
Done.

05:14.981 --> 05:16.449
Brendon Bragg, really?

05:16.516 --> 05:18.317
I thought we talked about this.

05:18.384 --> 05:20.019
Hold up. Look, rule number one:

05:20.086 --> 05:22.755
we have to stay on the same page,
so, let's just work this out.

05:22.822 --> 05:27.160
Okay. All right, we've got Denise.

05:27.226 --> 05:28.995
She is my first choice.

05:29.696 --> 05:32.498
Robert. A little bit more experience.

05:32.565 --> 05:34.367
Now, Cameron, he's got a fresh edge,

05:34.434 --> 05:37.503
which I actually think his youth
is gonna be an asset.

05:39.806 --> 05:41.174
What are you doing?

05:41.240 --> 05:42.742
Do you see what's going on here?

05:42.809 --> 05:44.210
They just fired Natalie.

05:44.277 --> 05:46.679
Diversity isn't in
and GDU is not gonna hire

05:46.746 --> 05:48.514
another Black correspondent.

05:48.581 --> 05:51.350
- They've already filled that quota.
- Us two.

05:51.417 --> 05:54.120
They tried diversity
with you and Ronda. It didn't work.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.622
But I can show them
that it could be different this time.

05:56.689 --> 05:58.424
It's bigger than you, Mary Jane.

05:58.491 --> 06:00.493
It's no longer Obama's America.

06:01.127 --> 06:02.495
The news is whitewashed.

06:02.562 --> 06:04.230
Look what happened to Tamron Hall.

06:04.297 --> 06:06.999
- She was leading in the ratings.
- Right.

06:07.066 --> 06:09.602
Yeah. We've gotta play our cards right.

06:09.669 --> 06:11.938
God, he's like the Grim Reaper now.

06:12.839 --> 06:15.575
- Tell me about it.
- But why now?

06:16.142 --> 06:19.045
I finally get here and now
I've gotta deal with this bullshit.

06:19.512 --> 06:23.382
I wanna be better than Ronda.
I wanna actually mentor Black talent.

06:23.449 --> 06:25.985
I'm sure she said the same thing
when she started out.

06:26.052 --> 06:28.121
Look, it's the system, all right?
It's not you.

06:29.655 --> 06:31.457
All right. Well...

06:31.524 --> 06:33.493
then let's go...

06:34.360 --> 06:37.463
- With Lindsay Finkel.
- Why her?

06:37.530 --> 06:39.799
She's woke.
That's how my girl described her,

06:39.866 --> 06:41.901
and she's got charisma in spades.

06:41.968 --> 06:43.136
Okay.

06:44.704 --> 06:46.873
Brendon Bragg. Right?

06:47.507 --> 06:49.609
Look, he's a buddy of mine
out of J school,

06:49.675 --> 06:51.644
and is killing it
in the west coast market.

06:51.711 --> 06:53.980
He's a fill-in reporter
in a fifth-tier market.

06:54.046 --> 06:55.381
With a lot of potential.

06:55.448 --> 06:59.385
Yeah, the potential to be the perfect
president of the Justin fan club. No.

06:59.452 --> 07:02.321
Look, what is good for me
is good for both of us.

07:02.388 --> 07:05.258
We need qualified journalists,
Justin, not kiss-asses.

07:10.863 --> 07:13.833
- Ken Botnam.
- Why's it gotta be a man?

07:13.900 --> 07:15.768
Why does it have to be a woman?

07:16.435 --> 07:19.071
Ken's coverage
of the Women's March was amazing.

07:19.138 --> 07:21.641
He's the type that will get guys

07:21.707 --> 07:23.543
to be interested in your stories.

07:23.609 --> 07:26.012
Okay, please tell me
you've made a decision.

07:28.614 --> 07:30.049
- Lindsay Finkel.
- Ken Botnam.

07:31.584 --> 07:33.386
Okay, listen.

07:34.253 --> 07:37.123
I'll interview them both and make
a decision at the end of the week.

07:38.524 --> 07:39.725
Thanks.

07:41.828 --> 07:42.929
Well...

07:45.531 --> 07:47.166
May the best White person win.

07:58.611 --> 08:01.214
OMG. Did you see?

08:01.280 --> 08:03.316
Nene might be returning
to "Real Housewives."

08:04.350 --> 08:06.552
Okay, if gossip from
your favorite reality show

08:06.619 --> 08:08.087
cannot get you out of this funk,

08:08.154 --> 08:10.623
I don't know what else I can do.
What's going on?

08:10.690 --> 08:12.124
Darnell and I broke up.

08:12.191 --> 08:13.626
What?

08:13.693 --> 08:16.028
When? I thought you
guys were having a baby.

08:16.095 --> 08:17.396
So did I.

08:18.064 --> 08:20.166
We had a surrogate
and everything lined up.

08:20.233 --> 08:21.667
So... what happened?

08:21.734 --> 08:23.469
He got cold feet.

08:23.903 --> 08:27.106
Something was up when he didn't show up
to the lawyer's office

08:27.173 --> 08:28.875
to sign the surrogacy contract.

08:28.941 --> 08:31.944
I get home and he's all moved out.

08:33.646 --> 08:36.849
He left me some pathetic note,
talking about "I'm sorry,"

08:36.916 --> 08:39.151
and "I'll send for the rest of my stuff."

08:39.218 --> 08:40.720
He's a coward.

08:40.786 --> 08:42.688
He served me with divorce papers.

08:42.755 --> 08:43.990
Baby...

08:45.825 --> 08:48.594
I know it's not much
of a consolation, but...

08:49.362 --> 08:51.430
I was a wreck
when I broke up with Lee,

08:52.198 --> 08:54.033
and then I remembered

08:54.100 --> 08:57.803
there are so many fish in the sea.

08:57.870 --> 08:59.372
Better fish.

09:00.006 --> 09:02.074
And, by better fish,

09:02.141 --> 09:05.511
do you mean the square-jawed, light-eyed,

09:05.578 --> 09:07.513
morning show producing species

09:08.447 --> 09:10.483
Justinious Talbotillus?

09:13.452 --> 09:15.788
You can't hide anything
from an astute gay.

09:16.622 --> 09:19.058
Obviously. Okay, well, look.

09:19.125 --> 09:21.994
With Garrett second-guessing
everything, I...

09:22.061 --> 09:23.930
- I can't really...
- It's okay.

09:24.597 --> 09:25.831
Your tea is safe with me.

09:27.133 --> 09:28.401
Thank you.

09:28.834 --> 09:30.503
And just know that, baby,

09:32.104 --> 09:33.973
I'm here for you, if you need me, okay?

09:36.008 --> 09:38.077
I really appreciate that.

09:38.711 --> 09:42.281
Garrett told me that he's interviewing
a reporter that you recommended.

09:42.348 --> 09:45.051
- Yeah, I think she's a shoo-in.
- So, who are you thinking?

09:47.787 --> 09:50.323
Lindsay. She's fantastic.

09:50.389 --> 09:52.925
Great skills. A natural talent.

09:52.992 --> 09:54.160
You have my vote, for sure.

09:56.329 --> 09:57.797
Good morning, I'm Aaron Felty.

09:57.863 --> 10:01.600
And I'm Mary Jane Paul,
and this is "Great Day USA."

10:01.667 --> 10:03.636
- Man...
- I'm not watching.

10:06.639 --> 10:08.441
What time did you get in last night?

10:10.142 --> 10:12.244
I know. Gimme...

10:12.311 --> 10:15.781
Child-proof locks can be
kinda hard sometimes, can't they?

10:16.716 --> 10:19.185
Is your boy Marco this bad off?

10:20.853 --> 10:22.888
That knucklehead always belts his back.

10:25.024 --> 10:26.092
Well...

10:26.859 --> 10:29.195
I need you to be clear
and focused tonight, okay?

10:30.696 --> 10:32.565
I told Marco you were going
with Mary Jane

10:32.631 --> 10:34.467
- for a girls' night.
- No, it's not that.

10:34.533 --> 10:37.236
I'm inviting Lee over
and you're all gonna help me prep

10:37.303 --> 10:39.939
for the second part
of this arbitration. Yes.

10:40.006 --> 10:41.474
I thought maybe we can role play.

10:43.075 --> 10:44.110
Role play?

10:45.211 --> 10:47.546
It's a double date, Orlando.
It's not an orgy.

10:47.613 --> 10:50.349
I was gonna say homework, but okay.

10:50.416 --> 10:53.853
<i>This is my last chance to pull my case
out of the fire, Papi.</i>

10:54.487 --> 10:57.390
Are you sure it's not an elaborate ploy
to keep me from my boys?

10:57.456 --> 10:58.924
You should be thanking me.

10:58.991 --> 11:02.061
I'm sparing you another night
of destroying your liver, okay?

11:02.128 --> 11:03.462
<i>Gracias, Mami.</i>

11:06.632 --> 11:08.067
And we're out.

11:09.368 --> 11:12.304
I saw what you did.
Getting Aaron to back your candidate.

11:12.371 --> 11:13.639
It's not gonna work.

11:13.706 --> 11:15.608
I forgot that I have
girls' night with Kara

11:15.674 --> 11:18.878
and now she wants me
to bring Lee. What am I gonna do?

11:19.845 --> 11:21.047
Come on.

11:28.521 --> 11:29.688
I've gotta tell her.

11:29.755 --> 11:31.991
She's my best friend.
I can't lie to her.

11:32.058 --> 11:34.260
- And I suck at it.
- Then don't lie, okay?

11:34.326 --> 11:35.694
Just delay the truth.

11:36.695 --> 11:39.398
No, stay silent.
People that lie tend to over explain.

11:39.465 --> 11:42.301
- Let her jump to her own conclusions.
- That just flew right on out.

11:42.368 --> 11:46.272
I mean, were you, like,
a politician in a previous life or...

11:46.338 --> 11:47.807
You just need some practice.

11:47.873 --> 11:49.141
Act like I'm Kara.

11:50.476 --> 11:53.879
Kara, the reason Lee
isn't here is because...

11:53.946 --> 11:56.582
Okay, we're not that kind of friends.

11:56.649 --> 11:59.819
If you can keep a straight face
while I do this...

12:01.987 --> 12:03.489
You're gonna be just fine.

12:04.056 --> 12:05.257
Someone could come in.

12:05.958 --> 12:07.059
I locked the door.

12:11.864 --> 12:12.965
You were saying?

12:13.032 --> 12:14.567
Kara, Lee and I broke up.

12:15.968 --> 12:17.570
There. So...

12:20.906 --> 12:22.274
Is that all you got?

12:41.494 --> 12:42.761
Tell me...

12:43.395 --> 12:44.663
about work.

12:47.066 --> 12:49.702
There's this asshole,

12:49.768 --> 12:51.804
who's always trying to rattle me.

12:56.942 --> 12:58.210
What's his problem?

12:59.044 --> 13:00.846
He only cares about ratings.

13:04.617 --> 13:08.120
And everybody keeps saying
that Ronda's the new Oprah.

13:11.991 --> 13:13.792
Hi...

13:13.859 --> 13:14.860
Where's Lee?

13:15.427 --> 13:17.496
- Lee's not coming.
- Honey, what's wrong?

13:18.764 --> 13:20.065
We broke up.

13:20.132 --> 13:22.468
- What?
- Are you serious?

13:24.069 --> 13:25.371
I'm gonna get you wine.

13:25.437 --> 13:28.207
Yeah. Honey, how did it happen?

13:28.274 --> 13:30.643
I mean, did you have
an argument or something?

13:31.277 --> 13:34.046
- It was just a lot.
- Baby.

13:34.113 --> 13:36.248
Gosh.

13:36.982 --> 13:39.118
Tell me what happened.

13:39.185 --> 13:41.220
- There you go.
- Thank you, babe. Thank you.

13:41.287 --> 13:42.321
Yeah.

13:51.597 --> 13:52.598
Yeah, I was just...

13:53.199 --> 13:55.968
I came home
and he was gone, and, like...

13:56.035 --> 13:57.503
all his stuff was gone.

13:57.570 --> 13:59.104
He got cold feet.

13:59.171 --> 14:02.308
Something was off when he didn't show up
to the fertility clinic

14:02.374 --> 14:03.442
to sign the contract.

14:03.509 --> 14:05.211
You didn't mention that.

14:05.277 --> 14:07.680
I came home
and he left this pathetic note

14:07.746 --> 14:11.183
talking about, like, "I'm sorry"
and "I'll send for my stuff."

14:11.250 --> 14:13.185
But he was just, like, a coward.

14:13.252 --> 14:14.853
- You know?
- Yeah.

14:14.920 --> 14:17.156
You know? I just...

14:17.223 --> 14:20.359
Are we talking about Lee, Lee?

14:20.426 --> 14:22.094
Lee Truitt, Lee?

14:22.161 --> 14:24.863
Mr. Over-communicator,
supersensitive Lee?

14:24.930 --> 14:26.432
Really?

14:26.498 --> 14:28.133
- All of a sudden.
- What?

14:28.200 --> 14:30.135
Just... it was just done.

14:31.570 --> 14:34.707
Honey, I'm so sorry.

14:34.773 --> 14:36.742
It's gonna be okay, Mama.

14:41.547 --> 14:44.283
Yeah, so my cousin, he pretty much
has me running the place.

14:44.350 --> 14:47.219
- Okay.
- Yeah, so I can get you a mad discount.

14:47.286 --> 14:48.988
All right, so maybe I'll stop by.

15:02.501 --> 15:04.503
So, this is what you meant
by buying me a drink?

15:06.672 --> 15:07.840
Unbelievable.

15:07.906 --> 15:11.110
So, what I can do is, I can just pay
you back when we get to my place.

15:11.176 --> 15:12.144
Back up.

15:13.345 --> 15:14.313
Thank you.

15:16.582 --> 15:17.650
This is ridiculous.

15:18.817 --> 15:19.785
Niecy.

15:20.386 --> 15:22.421
Where are you going?
That brother was fine.

15:22.488 --> 15:24.923
I'm not about to waste my time
on guys like Dante anymore.

15:25.357 --> 15:28.394
Come on, we paid way too much
for a babysitter.

15:28.460 --> 15:30.062
Let's have some fun.

15:30.496 --> 15:32.765
You have fun. I'm tired of it.

15:32.831 --> 15:34.066
Bye, Amika.

15:34.833 --> 15:37.603
- Remember, lots of carbs.
- Right. Thank you so much.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.571
The best thing to get over a break-up.

15:39.638 --> 15:40.973
- Right.
- You're telling me.

15:41.040 --> 15:42.808
If this arbitration doesn't end soon,

15:42.875 --> 15:44.610
I'll be 300 pounds next time you see me.

15:44.677 --> 15:46.412
<i>Then I'll call you "Big Papi Orlando."</i>

15:47.112 --> 15:48.747
Sorry, you guys, about, you know,

15:49.682 --> 15:51.817
high-jacking the prep with my problems.

15:51.884 --> 15:54.887
Honey, no, of course not.
Please, don't even worry about me.

15:54.953 --> 15:56.822
Besides, I think I know
what I've gotta do.

15:56.889 --> 15:57.923
Really?

15:58.724 --> 16:00.426
Really. I'm gonna be fine.

16:00.492 --> 16:02.561
- And you have so much on your mind.
- Yeah.

16:02.628 --> 16:03.729
- Okay.
- Yeah.

16:05.097 --> 16:06.398
Are you gonna answer that?

16:06.465 --> 16:07.499
What?

16:07.933 --> 16:09.168
Your phone.

16:09.234 --> 16:10.836
That could be Lee.

16:10.903 --> 16:12.671
- It could be work.
- Let me see.

16:12.738 --> 16:16.975
Okay, well, if it's work, it could be,
like, a violation of the...

16:17.042 --> 16:19.211
- Look and see. It could be Lee.
- Arbitration.

16:19.278 --> 16:21.347
- Who is it?
- Girl, it is Angelina Jolie.

16:21.413 --> 16:24.283
- What?
- Yeah, she's coming to do GDU tomorrow

16:24.350 --> 16:27.419
- and she's got questions.
- Angelina Jolie's gonna be on the show?

16:27.486 --> 16:29.421
- Yes.
- Wow.

16:29.488 --> 16:31.690
- With all the kids.
- What?

16:31.757 --> 16:36.028
Yeah, I've got so much stuff.
Let me go and deal with her.

16:36.095 --> 16:38.464
- All right, all right. Love you.
- It's not Lee.

16:38.530 --> 16:39.531
Yeah, well...

16:45.904 --> 16:47.139
She's lying.

16:47.973 --> 16:51.577
I mean, are you worried that we're...
starting off on the wrong foot?

16:51.643 --> 16:54.313
I mean, how many lies
do we have to tell before we...

16:55.314 --> 16:57.416
You're gonna have to trust me, okay?

16:57.483 --> 16:59.618
It's gonna be fine.

16:59.685 --> 17:01.587
- I do trust you.
- Do you?

17:01.653 --> 17:02.921
I do.

17:03.455 --> 17:05.324
It's just she's my best friend and...

17:06.291 --> 17:08.026
I can't keep lying to her.

17:17.369 --> 17:19.104
<i>We will be discussing weight loss tips</i>

17:19.171 --> 17:22.341
<i>to help you get that summer bikini body
you've always dreamed about.</i>

17:22.408 --> 17:25.010
She looks so... happy.

17:26.812 --> 17:29.815
My daughter has a thing
for scandal, apparently.

17:29.882 --> 17:33.018
Grandma, she's on morning television.

17:33.085 --> 17:34.853
Her job is to be happy.

17:35.421 --> 17:37.389
Call her and find out what's going on.

17:37.456 --> 17:40.125
- Are you serious?
- Yes, I'm serious.

17:40.192 --> 17:43.595
If she stepped out
on that nice British boy,

17:44.129 --> 17:47.399
it's got to be for a good reason.

17:47.466 --> 17:49.568
<i>...when we return
on "Great Day USA."</i>

17:49.635 --> 17:50.903
And we're clear.

17:58.210 --> 18:01.914
If we're all in attendance,
shall we begin?

18:01.980 --> 18:02.981
No.

18:03.982 --> 18:05.651
Excuse me?

18:05.717 --> 18:08.821
Ms. Lynch asks that you recuse yourself
from these proceedings.

18:09.488 --> 18:10.622
On what grounds?

18:10.689 --> 18:12.057
You've made several remarks

18:12.124 --> 18:14.393
that have no bearings
on this case and show bias.

18:14.460 --> 18:17.463
Like you commented
on my presence at a private suite

18:17.529 --> 18:21.099
at a New York baseball game,
you mentioned my boyfriend's occupation,

18:21.166 --> 18:25.404
and you made it a point to say something
about my wearing a designer suit, so...

18:26.071 --> 18:28.140
It's for these reasons

18:28.207 --> 18:31.443
we feel you're unfit
to oversee this arbitration.

18:35.547 --> 18:36.849
Goodbye.

18:42.054 --> 18:44.823
You killed it. Killed it.

18:45.524 --> 18:48.961
- No, no. Okay, what's rule number one?
- This is your producer talking.

18:49.027 --> 18:52.130
Okay, well, what if I wanted you
to talk to me like, you know...

18:53.999 --> 18:55.167
Well...

18:56.401 --> 18:59.104
Then I'd probably say it like...

18:59.171 --> 19:00.472
Hey, MJ!

19:01.473 --> 19:03.609
Hey! Wow!

19:04.276 --> 19:06.512
You look positive. How'd it go?

19:07.145 --> 19:10.516
I think I destroyed them. It's not over,
but I think I have a fighting shot.

19:10.582 --> 19:12.918
Let's do lunch
and I'll fill you in on the dirt.

19:12.985 --> 19:16.121
- I've got plans with Emma.
- Well, cancel them.

19:16.188 --> 19:20.692
I can't. We're working
on this whole internet Insta-Star story

19:20.759 --> 19:25.697
and we have to watch hours of videos
before we interview them this afternoon.

19:25.764 --> 19:28.300
This afternoon? Weren't you
working on a morning show?

19:28.367 --> 19:33.105
Yes, the Insta-Star segments
are all web-exclusive livecasts,

19:33.171 --> 19:34.439
the wave of the future.

19:34.506 --> 19:37.509
I think that's just an excuse
for them to get you to do more work.

19:37.576 --> 19:40.012
- You ain't never lied.
- Call me later.

19:40.078 --> 19:41.713
- All right?
- I will.

19:45.651 --> 19:47.152
<i>Cabrón.</i>

19:50.088 --> 19:52.257
<i>Affirmative Action is a disease.</i>

19:52.324 --> 19:54.526
<i>And it's affected this great country's</i>

19:54.593 --> 19:56.395
<i>- higher education...
- She say anything?</i>

19:57.663 --> 20:01.733
No, she's focused on arbitration,
but I can't take this much longer.

20:01.800 --> 20:03.435
What is this?

20:04.903 --> 20:06.038
Research.

20:06.872 --> 20:10.475
<i>If minorities aren't smart enough,
or qualified enough</i>

20:10.542 --> 20:14.746
<i>to get into school or get themselves
a job on their own,</i>

20:14.813 --> 20:16.481
<i>well then, guess what?</i>

20:16.548 --> 20:18.216
<i>Work someplace else.</i>

20:19.885 --> 20:22.254
I warned you that this
was gonna incite you.

20:22.321 --> 20:25.257
I only looked to see
how many views it got. That was it.

20:25.324 --> 20:28.327
I think her rant about Beyoncé
was the most popular.

20:28.393 --> 20:30.696
Me, personally,
I didn't find it that incendiary.

20:31.597 --> 20:35.701
She said Beyoncé couldn't be a sex symbol
and make political statements,

20:35.767 --> 20:38.270
yet this bitch wears black negligees

20:38.337 --> 20:41.607
and dyes her hair
daddy-doesn't-love-me platinum blond,

20:41.673 --> 20:44.943
all the while playing Sean Hannity
at her parents' freaking house,

20:45.010 --> 20:48.280
but expects us to listen to her politics.
You've gotta be kidding me.

20:50.015 --> 20:52.284
Okay, the hypocrisy alone is...

20:52.351 --> 20:54.353
Point taken. I got it.

20:55.187 --> 20:57.022
Hey, check it out.

20:57.589 --> 20:59.524
My pick for correspondent.

21:00.258 --> 21:02.427
They've been in there
talking for a while.

21:02.494 --> 21:04.129
It can only be a good sign.

21:04.830 --> 21:06.999
Yeah, if stiff shoulders
and curt head nods

21:07.065 --> 21:09.668
is an indicator of great conversation,
yeah, totally.

21:09.735 --> 21:11.103
Garrett's playing hardball.

21:11.169 --> 21:13.639
Did he look like that
when he interviewed you?

21:14.906 --> 21:18.543
You know, if you had just
backed him from the beginning,

21:18.610 --> 21:20.245
this would be going differently.

21:20.312 --> 21:23.248
So, now it's my fault that your candidate
has a weak handshake.

21:23.315 --> 21:24.316
Got it.

21:26.752 --> 21:28.420
Justin. My office.

21:28.487 --> 21:29.888
Yeah. Okay.

21:33.125 --> 21:35.494
I just got an earful
from the brass upstairs

21:35.560 --> 21:36.895
about Kara's arbitration.

21:36.962 --> 21:38.163
I heard it was going well.

21:38.230 --> 21:42.267
It was, until Kara's lawyer
had the arbitrator removed.

21:44.503 --> 21:45.904
This is a business.

21:45.971 --> 21:49.441
Okay? If we lose and have to pay her out,
it affects the show's budget,

21:49.508 --> 21:52.110
and that affects the quality
of what we do here.

21:52.778 --> 21:54.746
Look, Kara didn't do her job.

21:54.813 --> 21:56.982
It ain't pretty, but it's the truth.

21:58.016 --> 22:00.552
Good. That's exactly
what I want you to say

22:00.619 --> 22:03.188
in your testimony tomorrow
at Kara's arbitration.

22:07.693 --> 22:09.661
My testimony?

22:10.595 --> 22:14.099
- Garrett, I don't think that's a...
- Justin, you made this mess.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.333
It's yours to clean up.

22:19.838 --> 22:23.608
Do whatever it takes to make sure
that Kara Lynch loses.

22:33.452 --> 22:37.823
So, Dani, does the number
55 million ring any bells?

22:37.889 --> 22:39.558
<i>I have a very strong fan base.</i>

22:39.624 --> 22:44.496
If your subscribers were a country,
they'd be the 25th largest in the world.

22:44.563 --> 22:46.732
I love each and every one of them.

22:46.798 --> 22:49.101
Even JewHaterKKK69?

22:49.167 --> 22:52.170
She walked right into that one.
Don't let her sweat for too long.

22:52.237 --> 22:54.339
Well, obviously,
I don't know all of them,

22:54.406 --> 22:57.175
but I believe that everyone
is entitled to their free speech.

22:57.242 --> 22:59.311
Right. Well, it's funny
that you say "free,"

22:59.377 --> 23:02.681
because have you noticed that
people with screen names like that,

23:02.748 --> 23:05.884
they prefer to be anonymous.
There's never any profile pictures,

23:05.951 --> 23:08.019
or it's a Confederate flag,

23:08.086 --> 23:09.988
or a bald eagle holding machine guns.

23:10.055 --> 23:14.126
But do you think they're too ashamed
of their opinions to put their faces?

23:14.192 --> 23:17.462
Possibly. Not everybody's as brave as me
to speak their minds.

23:17.529 --> 23:20.298
That's true, but not everyone
is as pretty as you are, either.

23:20.365 --> 23:21.600
Thank you.

23:21.666 --> 23:25.137
But I digress. I'd really hate to give
any of those hate-mongers

23:25.203 --> 23:27.239
a platform they don't deserve, right?

23:27.305 --> 23:30.542
Well, so, tell me, how does a young woman
from Plunkett City, Oklahoma

23:30.609 --> 23:31.810
build an empire like this?

23:31.877 --> 23:34.045
I speak to the regular people,

23:34.112 --> 23:36.548
the hard-working backbone of America.

23:36.615 --> 23:38.817
We all know she's not talking
about Black people.

23:38.884 --> 23:41.887
<i>...the disenfranchised,
the people who built this great country.</i>

23:41.953 --> 23:44.689
- Now who would that be?
- I'm talking about the farm families.

23:44.756 --> 23:47.692
The preachers,
the teachers, and the teamsters.

23:47.759 --> 23:49.694
Really, anyone from the heartland,

23:49.761 --> 23:51.129
the working class.

23:51.963 --> 23:53.198
Let's talk method.

23:53.265 --> 23:54.833
You make it look so easy, Dani.

23:54.900 --> 23:58.069
Those videos that have made you
a viral sensation,

23:58.136 --> 24:00.772
they're shot in your bedroom.
Tell me more.

24:00.839 --> 24:02.774
Those three-minute videos that you see

24:02.841 --> 24:06.578
are a product of working 15 hours
a day, seven days a week,

24:06.645 --> 24:10.382
spent researching, fact-checking,
writing and editing.

24:10.448 --> 24:13.618
How much fact-checking
goes into an opinion piece?

24:13.685 --> 24:16.988
Because that's what the videos are,
after all, right? Your opinion.

24:17.055 --> 24:18.790
A lot more than you would think.

24:18.857 --> 24:21.693
I like to know as much as I can
about a subject before I address it.

24:21.760 --> 24:24.062
That can't leave you much time
for anything else.

24:24.129 --> 24:26.731
Are you kidding?
I don't have a social life at all.

24:26.798 --> 24:29.100
I can't even remember
the last time I went on a date.

24:29.167 --> 24:30.869
Well, that makes you a news widow.

24:30.936 --> 24:33.238
Welcome to the club, Dani.

24:33.305 --> 24:36.107
<i>We'll be right back
with more from "Great Day USA."</i>

24:37.142 --> 24:39.544
Holding back on her
was one of the hardest things

24:39.611 --> 24:40.846
I've had to do in my life.

24:40.912 --> 24:42.314
I wouldn't say you held back,

24:42.380 --> 24:46.284
but by the end, I think the audience felt
that you could, at least, be civil.

24:46.351 --> 24:49.521
Are you saying I made you believe
that I actually like that woman?

24:52.757 --> 24:54.726
- Then I win.
- It doesn't mean that I lose.

24:54.793 --> 24:57.028
No, it absolutely does mean
that you lost.

24:57.095 --> 25:00.832
That look. That look that says, defeat,

25:00.899 --> 25:03.635
that look that says, "Mary Jane is right,

25:03.702 --> 25:05.871
and she's just too damn smart for me".

25:05.937 --> 25:08.707
That look is quite the turn-on.

25:09.374 --> 25:10.442
Don't get used to it.

25:15.680 --> 25:17.382
Maybe I should get used to it.

25:17.449 --> 25:20.385
It looks like
my little white girl is killing it.

25:26.524 --> 25:29.661
The look on that smug bastard's face

25:29.728 --> 25:33.198
when the attorney told him
he was being sexist was priceless.

25:34.366 --> 25:35.734
What?

25:36.568 --> 25:38.570
There is something so sexy about you

25:38.637 --> 25:40.338
- when you get shit done.
- Yeah?

25:40.405 --> 25:41.840
You don't like housewife Kara?

25:43.308 --> 25:44.809
You're always sexy.

25:44.876 --> 25:48.346
I just missed that fire that you had
when you were at GDU.

25:48.413 --> 25:51.316
You were strong, felt empowered.

25:51.383 --> 25:53.218
Kicking ass.

25:53.285 --> 25:55.487
That's the real you,
not some kept housewife.

25:57.622 --> 25:59.591
- Thank you.
- Yeah?

26:01.793 --> 26:03.929
Wait a minute. That's my phone. Hold on.

26:05.397 --> 26:07.766
Look at these tweets.
Come on, look at this.

26:08.066 --> 26:11.136
Are those the tweets of a guy
who just dumped his girlfriend?

26:11.202 --> 26:12.671
Absolutely not.

26:13.538 --> 26:15.440
Look at these jokes.

26:16.308 --> 26:18.843
These jokes are, like, self-deprecating.

26:18.910 --> 26:22.347
- They're heart-broken even.
- You're reading Lee's tweets now?

26:22.414 --> 26:25.517
I'm reading Lee's tweets
because I know Mary Jane is lying.

26:27.252 --> 26:29.187
Why don't you talk to her
about it already?

26:29.254 --> 26:30.789
Nope. Know what?

26:30.855 --> 26:32.257
I've decided

26:32.324 --> 26:37.629
that I am gonna have some fun

26:37.696 --> 26:38.997
with her.

26:39.064 --> 26:40.699
You know, I like to have fun.

26:41.266 --> 26:45.136
Well, you like the Kara
that gets shit done.

26:45.637 --> 26:46.805
Well, this is her.

26:48.373 --> 26:49.808
See you later.

26:49.874 --> 26:51.476
I didn't mean right this second.

26:53.578 --> 26:55.013
Lay down.

27:03.254 --> 27:05.690
Do we have to have ground rules
about this as well?

27:06.725 --> 27:07.993
Yeah. Sorry.

27:08.059 --> 27:09.327
Rule one.

27:09.995 --> 27:12.897
When I'm in control,
I want complete surrender.

27:12.964 --> 27:15.900
- No safe words.
- Deal.

27:17.936 --> 27:19.337
- Rule two.
- Yeah?

27:20.071 --> 27:21.606
When I'm in control...

27:23.475 --> 27:25.877
- I have every part of you.
- Deal.

27:28.346 --> 27:30.482
Okay, rule number three.

27:30.548 --> 27:33.718
When we start,
we don't stop, no matter what.

27:34.452 --> 27:35.387
Yeah.

27:38.790 --> 27:41.126
Geez, it's... my niece.

27:41.192 --> 27:43.695
Okay, well, don't...
You're breaking the rules already.

27:45.597 --> 27:47.832
<i>- Hey, Niecy.
- Hey, Auntie, what's up?</i>

27:47.899 --> 27:49.167
Is everything okay?

27:49.234 --> 27:52.937
I was just seeing
how you were doing, you know?

27:53.004 --> 27:55.640
<i>What's going on. You there?</i>

27:55.707 --> 27:57.742
Can I call you back? Great.

27:57.809 --> 27:59.611
All right. Bye.

28:01.579 --> 28:03.681
Guess I'll try some other time.

28:08.053 --> 28:09.888
- Just mute it.
- No, it's Kara.

28:09.954 --> 28:11.656
I've gotta take it. I can't...

28:13.158 --> 28:16.161
<i>- Hey, Kara.
- Hey.</i>

28:16.227 --> 28:17.262
What's up?

28:17.328 --> 28:18.897
<i>Get dressed. I'm coming over.</i>

28:18.963 --> 28:22.634
<i>We need to drown your sorrows
with a proper girls' night out tonight.</i>

28:22.700 --> 28:26.171
Tonight? No, no.

28:26.738 --> 28:29.774
Girl, I am in that stage of grieving

28:29.841 --> 28:32.644
where I'm just in sweatpants
and eating ice cream,

28:32.710 --> 28:34.145
so, I... I can't.

28:34.212 --> 28:36.081
<i>Yeah? Well, too bad, okay?</i>

28:36.147 --> 28:37.415
<i>I'm almost there anyway.</i>

28:37.482 --> 28:39.250
Wait. What? Wait. Where are you?

28:39.317 --> 28:41.419
<i>Downstairs. My cab just pulled up.</i>

28:41.486 --> 28:43.721
You're downstairs? Okay.

28:44.422 --> 28:46.424
You know, just... stay right there.

28:46.491 --> 28:48.760
Don't move. Don't come up here.

28:54.065 --> 28:55.800
So, where are we gonna go?

28:55.867 --> 28:58.002
So, Lee has a show tonight

28:58.069 --> 28:59.704
and we're gonna make an appearance.

28:59.771 --> 29:01.306
Why would I wanna do that?

29:01.372 --> 29:05.276
To heckle the bastard and get back at him
for breaking your heart.

29:05.343 --> 29:06.778
No, we can't do that.

29:06.845 --> 29:08.780
That way too mean, Kara, and crazy.

29:08.847 --> 29:12.117
Girl, you've done a lot worse to guys
who've done much less, okay?

29:12.183 --> 29:14.085
But, yeah, Lee's not that bad.

29:14.152 --> 29:15.386
Seriously?

29:15.453 --> 29:17.856
He left you when you were trying
to have his baby.

29:17.922 --> 29:19.324
That sounds pretty bad to me.

29:19.390 --> 29:21.059
Kara, we're not going to Lee's show.

29:21.126 --> 29:22.293
Why not?

29:22.360 --> 29:24.028
Because I broke up with him.

29:25.096 --> 29:26.231
I knew it.

29:26.297 --> 29:28.633
- I didn't wanna lie to you.
- But you did lie to me.

29:28.700 --> 29:32.837
Because you knew that you were blowing up
a relationship that was going perfectly.

29:32.904 --> 29:34.305
It wasn't going perfectly.

29:34.372 --> 29:36.341
Tell me what was wrong.
What's your excuse?

29:36.407 --> 29:38.076
Kara, no relationship is perfect.

29:38.143 --> 29:41.613
Exactly, MJ. That's why you work on it.
That's what relationships are about.

29:41.679 --> 29:43.114
- You really wanna know?
- Yeah.

29:43.181 --> 29:45.984
I broke up with Lee because I...

29:46.551 --> 29:49.020
- I'm out of his league.
- What?

29:49.087 --> 29:50.989
Look, I'm sorry if that sounds too harsh.

29:51.055 --> 29:55.693
I'm lead anchor and I want someone
who matches my hustle.

29:55.760 --> 29:58.196
I want a man who's gonna
ride to the top with me.

29:58.263 --> 30:01.900
Mary Jane, you have been waiting
for this man for ten years.

30:01.966 --> 30:03.768
- Maybe even more.
- So what?

30:04.302 --> 30:07.272
I have faith
that my perfect man is out there.

30:08.506 --> 30:11.376
Girl, you are 40 years old
and he hasn't shown up yet.

30:11.442 --> 30:14.479
And what? So, now, suddenly
he's just right around the corner?

30:14.546 --> 30:15.513
Really?

30:16.514 --> 30:17.482
Maybe.

30:18.583 --> 30:20.718
Yeah.
Excuse me, sir? Do you know what?

30:20.785 --> 30:23.555
Can you turn around and take us
back to her apartment, please?

30:23.621 --> 30:25.023
Because girls' night is now over.

30:46.511 --> 30:50.081
Kara Lynch is one of the best
producers at "Great Day USA,"

30:50.148 --> 30:52.784
probably one of the best producers
I've ever worked with.

30:54.152 --> 30:56.421
Every segment of hers
was thoroughly researched,

30:56.487 --> 30:58.089
more so than I've ever seen.

30:58.156 --> 31:01.593
That's why I found it
so perplexing that she just

31:01.993 --> 31:04.729
simply did not do
the same level of research

31:04.796 --> 31:06.931
on the Liz Turnow
Internet bullying story.

31:06.998 --> 31:09.300
But it wasn't my story.

31:09.367 --> 31:11.569
The fact-check supposedly was done

31:11.636 --> 31:13.071
before it even reached my desk.

31:13.137 --> 31:15.873
Ms. Lynch, please let
Mr. Talbot finish his statement.

31:19.077 --> 31:21.713
What about the North Carolina
sex scandal story

31:21.779 --> 31:23.147
that you produced for Aaron?

31:23.214 --> 31:26.384
- What about it?
- You took that over from Jamie, right?

31:26.451 --> 31:29.287
It wasn't your story,
but you went above and beyond

31:29.354 --> 31:31.422
and started the research from square one.

31:31.489 --> 31:33.157
- Is that true?
- Yeah, that's true.

31:33.224 --> 31:36.961
- But that doesn't mean that...
- You've done your due diligence,

31:37.028 --> 31:38.463
and this time, you simply did not.

31:39.030 --> 31:40.765
And that's a fireable offense.

31:53.011 --> 31:54.512
Kara, wait.

31:54.579 --> 31:57.148
Let me guess. "It's nothing personal."

31:58.082 --> 31:59.617
I was just doing my job.

31:59.684 --> 32:03.554
Your job is to produce the news, asshole,

32:03.621 --> 32:07.091
not drag my name
through the mud and embarrass me.

32:07.158 --> 32:10.328
It's the facts, all right?
They asked for my testimony, I gave it.

32:10.395 --> 32:12.630
Bullshit! You enjoyed yourself in there.

32:12.697 --> 32:14.499
And you know what? Why am I surprised?

32:14.565 --> 32:16.834
Because all you care about
is climbing the ladder

32:16.901 --> 32:19.237
and you knock anybody down
who's in your way.

32:19.304 --> 32:21.239
First Ronda, now me.

32:21.706 --> 32:22.940
Who's next?

32:23.841 --> 32:25.143
Mary Jane maybe?

32:26.711 --> 32:28.146
You know what?

32:28.212 --> 32:31.616
I bet you've never won a damn thing
fairly in your entire life.

32:31.683 --> 32:34.986
If you spend less time
playing the victim,

32:35.053 --> 32:38.723
maybe you'd be
in a better position right now.

32:44.729 --> 32:46.264
I want that one right there.

32:46.331 --> 32:47.865
Trifling.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.668
Trifling. Trifling.

32:50.735 --> 32:52.804
Girl, you swipe to the left
like that's your job.

32:53.738 --> 32:54.839
Trifling.

32:54.906 --> 32:56.607
Trifling.

32:57.709 --> 32:59.043
Sexy.

33:00.244 --> 33:01.512
But trifling.

33:01.579 --> 33:03.715
How you know he's trifling?

33:03.781 --> 33:05.483
Because he's from Atlanta.

33:06.751 --> 33:07.919
I hear that.

33:11.022 --> 33:12.457
What are you doing?

33:12.957 --> 33:14.926
I'm changing my search to New York.

33:17.261 --> 33:19.030
Now that is what I call a man.

33:19.597 --> 33:22.400
Having a long-distance relationship
with some New York Negro

33:22.467 --> 33:24.469
ain't gonna feed your kids.

33:33.778 --> 33:34.746
Hey.

33:36.214 --> 33:38.249
I started without you.

33:41.152 --> 33:44.655
Look, I don't want anything
to come between us and there's...

33:45.323 --> 33:49.293
there's really nothing
that is more important to me...

33:52.196 --> 33:54.165
Jesus, what happened? What's wrong?

33:55.266 --> 33:57.502
Kara, tell me what's wrong.
What happened?

33:59.637 --> 34:03.674
That devil, he tried to destroy me
in my arbitration today.

34:03.741 --> 34:05.810
- What? Who did what?
- Justin!

34:06.677 --> 34:09.881
He tried to make me look
completely negligent.

34:10.848 --> 34:12.383
You've gotta be kidding me.

34:12.450 --> 34:14.419
Why are you surprised, Mary Jane?

34:14.485 --> 34:16.421
I told you, that man is evil.

34:16.487 --> 34:17.688
It's gonna be okay.

34:17.755 --> 34:19.157
No, it's not gonna be okay.

34:19.223 --> 34:20.792
If I lose that arbitration,

34:20.858 --> 34:23.327
my reputation's gonna be killed.

34:23.394 --> 34:26.330
- Nobody will ever hire me as a producer.
- We're gonna figure it out.

34:26.831 --> 34:28.666
I'm sorry, Mama,
you needed to talk to me.

34:29.434 --> 34:31.068
What did you need to talk to me about?

34:31.135 --> 34:32.870
Girl, it's not even important now.

34:33.438 --> 34:34.972
- Are you sure?
- I'm positive.

34:35.039 --> 34:36.374
My hands were tied.

34:36.774 --> 34:38.910
Garrett wanted me to bury her.

34:38.976 --> 34:42.079
You somehow can maneuver
your way onto big stories,

34:42.146 --> 34:45.249
you masterminded Ronda getting axed,

34:45.316 --> 34:47.018
but when it comes to Kara's hearing,

34:47.084 --> 34:50.488
damn, you are just
amazingly fresh out of ideas.

34:50.555 --> 34:52.323
Garrett gave me no choice.

34:52.390 --> 34:53.658
Really?

34:53.724 --> 34:56.727
Why is it that you want
to keep our secret from Kara so bad?

34:57.428 --> 34:58.663
I don't.

34:58.729 --> 35:01.732
I'm stupid? Is that what it is?

35:01.799 --> 35:03.267
I'm stupid.

35:03.334 --> 35:04.602
I must be stupid.

35:08.139 --> 35:10.041
Justin, my man.

35:10.107 --> 35:12.743
I got a call from upstairs.
Things are looking good.

35:12.810 --> 35:13.978
I wouldn't be too sure.

35:14.345 --> 35:17.114
But the CTS lawyers were optimistic.

35:17.181 --> 35:20.418
Yeah, well, maybe they know more
about this kind of thing than I do.

35:20.485 --> 35:22.019
Okay, what are you saying?

35:22.520 --> 35:25.723
Look, Kara has the female card
going in her favor, right?

35:25.790 --> 35:28.125
Today went well,
but I don't think it was enough.

35:31.162 --> 35:32.263
What do you suggest?

35:32.864 --> 35:34.465
All I know...

35:35.399 --> 35:37.001
is that there's only one way

35:37.068 --> 35:39.136
to make sure
that we don't have to pay Kara

35:39.203 --> 35:41.205
a dime of that settlement money.

35:43.741 --> 35:46.344
I don't know about you,
but I tend to prefer a sure thing.

36:01.225 --> 36:03.561
- It's so great to have you back!
- I'm still in shock.

36:03.628 --> 36:06.063
Listen, not only do I have my job back,

36:06.130 --> 36:08.299
but Garrett bumped me to senior producer.

36:08.933 --> 36:11.669
- My God, that's incredible.
- I know! I can't believe it.

36:11.736 --> 36:13.170
I don't know what you did, girl,

36:13.237 --> 36:15.139
- but my God.
- No, no, I didn't...

36:15.206 --> 36:16.440
Just shh!

36:16.507 --> 36:19.243
Just accept my thanks already, please.
Okay?

36:19.844 --> 36:21.212
I am so happy.

36:22.280 --> 36:23.581
I'm so happy.

36:25.483 --> 36:27.552
<i>And it's with a heavy heart
that we say goodbye</i>

36:27.618 --> 36:30.621
<i>to America's furry sweetheart,
Ling-Ling the panda.</i>

36:30.688 --> 36:31.856
You know what, Grandma?

36:32.523 --> 36:34.158
You're right.

36:34.225 --> 36:36.661
She does seem to be smiling
a lot more lately.

36:38.296 --> 36:39.397
I told you.

36:39.997 --> 36:42.266
Something is up.

36:43.200 --> 36:45.169
Sorry I couldn't get more out of her.

36:45.236 --> 36:47.838
You know, if she were here,
we could talk in person,

36:47.905 --> 36:50.141
and I can get to the bottom
of what's going on.

36:51.108 --> 36:52.977
You're right.

36:53.611 --> 36:56.047
We need to get her to come visit.

36:57.081 --> 36:58.816
Or you could go visit her.

36:58.883 --> 37:01.719
No, I can't go to New York right now.

37:01.786 --> 37:05.022
But you could, Niecy.

37:05.890 --> 37:07.525
Grandma, I don't know. The kids...

37:07.592 --> 37:09.226
Well, I can do the kids...

37:10.294 --> 37:11.562
for a minute.

37:12.830 --> 37:15.733
I think we can find
an inexpensive ticket.

37:15.800 --> 37:18.736
Well, you know,
if you think that'll help,

37:18.803 --> 37:20.338
I'll do whatever you need me to do.

37:20.905 --> 37:23.207
My sweet little grandbaby.

37:25.176 --> 37:27.445
- I'll get right on it.
- Okay.

37:28.479 --> 37:29.914
Paul?

37:43.694 --> 37:45.296
So fine.

37:47.832 --> 37:49.800
<i>Everyone's entitled to their free speech.</i>

37:49.867 --> 37:50.801
Hey.

37:51.669 --> 37:53.237
I just wanted to say thank you.

37:53.304 --> 37:57.008
It couldn't have been easy getting
the brass to agree to Kara coming back.

37:57.074 --> 37:58.743
It took a little maneuvering,

37:58.809 --> 38:01.812
but I also got them to sign off
on the new correspondent.

38:01.879 --> 38:03.781
She's stopping by today, in fact.

38:03.848 --> 38:04.949
She?

38:05.016 --> 38:06.651
So, you went with Lindsay.

38:07.485 --> 38:09.020
Her. Nah.

38:11.722 --> 38:15.292
Aaron told me he had been intimate
with Lindsay in the past.

38:15.359 --> 38:19.163
So, you know, office romances,
they are not good for business.

38:19.230 --> 38:21.098
So, who did you end up going with?

38:21.666 --> 38:23.367
<i>Those three-minute videos that...</i>

38:23.434 --> 38:26.270
Your interview with Dani
was the spark, yeah.

38:26.337 --> 38:29.874
She has got exactly
what we need in a new correspondent.

38:29.940 --> 38:33.077
I mean, she doesn't have
traditional news experience,

38:33.144 --> 38:35.613
but she has already a built-in audience,

38:35.680 --> 38:37.748
the work ethic, the skills.

38:37.815 --> 38:39.483
The execs love the idea.

38:39.550 --> 38:41.819
I had to throw a hefty salary
at her to compete

38:41.886 --> 38:44.321
with the Internet ad money
that she's making, but...

38:44.989 --> 38:46.490
She's gonna be the first

38:46.557 --> 38:49.694
blogger-turned-morning-show
correspondent ever.

38:50.227 --> 38:53.764
Yeah, we're making history
here at GDU, Mary Jane.

38:53.831 --> 38:55.399
It's all thanks to you.

38:56.233 --> 38:58.035
An alt-right pandering Internet star.

38:58.102 --> 38:59.937
Really? What the hell was he thinking?

39:00.004 --> 39:01.739
This would have never happened

39:01.806 --> 39:05.009
if we had both backed the same person.

39:05.743 --> 39:07.044
You're right.

39:07.111 --> 39:10.881
We need to be a united front
now more than ever.

39:11.482 --> 39:13.217
I'm sorry I doubted you.

39:15.186 --> 39:17.388
What you did for Kara, that was...

39:19.490 --> 39:20.991
It wasn't a big deal.

39:21.058 --> 39:23.160
How did you get her back, anyway?

39:27.531 --> 39:29.300
She was asking for parity.

39:29.366 --> 39:32.470
I got them to give her
a title bump to Senior Producer.

39:33.871 --> 39:35.239
It didn't cost them a dime.

39:36.507 --> 39:38.709
You're willing to share
your title with her.

39:42.146 --> 39:44.081
And I thought that meant so much to you.
