01:14.083 --> 01:16.000
Uh, me? No, no.

01:16.042 --> 01:18.125
You look like you're
dressed to leave, though.

01:18.167 --> 01:19.875
How observant.

01:19.917 --> 01:22.167
I've been summoned to cover
our army's embarkation

01:22.208 --> 01:23.667
from Philadelphia to New York.

01:23.708 --> 01:26.583
Oh, the retreat.

01:26.625 --> 01:28.625
That's right. Well...

01:28.667 --> 01:30.875
they'll do very well to have the
Queen's Rangers looking over them.

01:30.917 --> 01:32.917
Travel safe.

01:32.958 --> 01:34.958
Upon mustering my men this morning,

01:34.958 --> 01:38.875
I find two are missing...
Maclnnis and Tanner.

01:38.917 --> 01:40.833
- Have you seen them?
- Can't say I have, no.

01:40.875 --> 01:43.167
Cannot say or will not say?

01:43.208 --> 01:46.625
( Men arguing )

01:48.542 --> 01:51.292
<i>( Rangers singing indistinctly )</i>

01:53.875 --> 01:56.708
Hey, where'd you get that flask?

01:56.750 --> 01:58.208
That's Maclnnis's.

02:00.042 --> 02:03.708
Oh. What's it doing here
and where's my bloody flask?

02:03.750 --> 02:06.833
To hell with yours! Where's
Maclnnis and Tanner?

02:06.875 --> 02:09.375
<i>They ain't showed today and
they didn't show yesterday.</i>

02:09.417 --> 02:11.625
I don't understand why you
think I should've seen them.

02:11.625 --> 02:14.625
Because I sent them to follow you.

02:14.667 --> 02:16.417
Why would you do that?

02:16.458 --> 02:18.083
To look after your safety

02:18.125 --> 02:20.292
since you seemed threatened
by Corporal Eastin.

02:20.292 --> 02:22.292
Well, when they do show their sorry selves,

02:22.333 --> 02:25.292
tell them to return my
property, the thievin' toyles!

02:25.333 --> 02:28.417
( Shouting )

02:33.750 --> 02:37.667
Thank you very much, Captain, but I
wouldn't worry yourself for my safety.

02:38.583 --> 02:40.250
( Indistinct shouting )

02:41.625 --> 02:43.292
- ( rifle cocks )
- Halt!

02:43.292 --> 02:46.375
Stand fast!

02:46.375 --> 02:48.083
They have Maclnnis's flask!

02:50.042 --> 02:52.667
I should never have allowed
Akinbode to leave for New York.

02:52.708 --> 02:55.042
You idiots cannot keep yourselves in line.

02:55.083 --> 02:56.583
Captain Simcoe!

02:56.625 --> 03:00.542
Order your men to stand down their arms.

03:00.583 --> 03:02.750
After you, sir.

03:19.625 --> 03:21.875
Allowing two British forces
to bloody each other

03:21.917 --> 03:24.583
wouldn't be good for
either of us, now would it?

03:24.625 --> 03:26.917
Blood has already been spilled.

03:26.958 --> 03:30.125
If you know what's good for
you, you'll leave this town.

03:30.167 --> 03:31.750
You're in luck.

03:31.792 --> 03:33.792
Major Andre has called us to New Jersey

03:33.833 --> 03:36.333
on an assignment of actual importance.

03:36.375 --> 03:40.375

__

04:44.654 --> 04:45.883
Clinton: Not now, Major.

04:45.883 --> 04:47.657
General, if you will take
but a moment to consider...

04:47.657 --> 04:50.240
I don't have a moment, John.

04:50.323 --> 04:52.573
We're already moving too slowly as it is

04:52.573 --> 04:54.907
to entertain the notion
of moving any slower.

04:54.990 --> 04:57.323
Unless you think it wise to be trapped

04:57.323 --> 05:00.823
between the French fleet
and the Continental Army?

05:00.823 --> 05:02.657
Of course not, sir.

05:02.740 --> 05:05.323
I think it wise to destroy
Washington's army now

05:05.407 --> 05:08.157
and cause the French to
reconsider their support.

05:09.407 --> 05:10.990
( Sighs )

05:11.073 --> 05:13.740
You propose to leave our
rear guard undefended?

05:13.823 --> 05:16.323
Lightly defended. 1,500 infantry.

05:16.323 --> 05:18.573
Just enough to tempt the
enemy into open ground.

05:18.573 --> 05:21.740
And once they take the bait, that's
when Cornwallis brings up his division.

05:21.823 --> 05:24.073
If they take the bait.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.740
Lee is heading their advance corps.

05:26.823 --> 05:28.657
He will march half of Washington's army

05:28.657 --> 05:30.157
into the jaws of a trap

05:30.157 --> 05:32.323
and then preside over a disastrous retreat.

05:32.407 --> 05:36.073
Their columns, their
spirits will be broken, sir.

05:37.990 --> 05:39.740
Well, you're in quite the hurry

05:39.740 --> 05:41.573
to end this, aren't you, John?

05:43.573 --> 05:45.657
As I assume you are, sir.

05:45.657 --> 05:49.157
Oh, I can't wait to get
back to London, true.

05:49.157 --> 05:52.407
But it seems you can't wait to get
back to Philadelphia even more.

05:59.323 --> 06:03.823
So, where do you suppose
this trap best be sprung?

06:07.823 --> 06:09.990
Monmouth Courthouse.

06:09.990 --> 06:13.573
The surrounding farmland will leave
Clinton's baggage train exposed.

06:13.657 --> 06:15.907
We can pin his rearguard
between the treeline here

06:15.990 --> 06:18.073
whilst the rest of our division
encircles them from the left.

06:18.073 --> 06:19.990
He'll have the surprise of his life, sir.

06:19.990 --> 06:22.407
I fear surprise will not be a factor.

06:22.407 --> 06:24.823
Sir, our main body is so large

06:24.907 --> 06:27.157
that any element of surprise
will surely be lost.

06:27.157 --> 06:28.740
We don't need surprise.

06:28.740 --> 06:31.823
For the first time in this bloody
conflict, we have the numbers...

06:31.823 --> 06:34.073
nearly 6,000 to their 1,500.

06:34.157 --> 06:36.240
How have you come by that number, sir?

06:38.573 --> 06:42.407
Tallmadge, I would've hoped
that General Washington

06:42.490 --> 06:44.490
would've impressed upon
you that the key to victory

06:44.490 --> 06:47.073
lies in having the correct intelligence.

06:47.073 --> 06:50.407
I learned these numbers
from my scouts, of course.

06:50.407 --> 06:52.990
And have they told you where Cornwallis is?

06:53.073 --> 06:54.573
If he counters our charge,
we may not be able...

06:54.657 --> 06:56.823
By the time Clinton and Cornwallis
bring up their columns,

06:56.823 --> 06:58.323
I'll have decimated their rear.

06:58.407 --> 07:01.657
The regiments will be able to hold
the rest till Washington arrives.

07:01.657 --> 07:05.490
Of course with our esteemed
commander camped back at Rocky Hill,

07:05.573 --> 07:07.157
he's likely to miss the whole show.

07:07.157 --> 07:08.907
( Chuckles )

07:08.990 --> 07:11.990
Then perhaps we should wait
for the reinforcements...

07:12.073 --> 07:13.907
Perhaps you should ready your dragoons.

07:13.990 --> 07:16.740
They have the honor of leading the van.

07:16.823 --> 07:20.907
You get to be tip of the spear, Major.

07:24.990 --> 07:26.657
Yes, sir.

07:29.573 --> 07:32.907
- ( Chatter )
- <i> ( Hammering )</i>

07:32.907 --> 07:36.073
<i>( bird screeching )</i>

07:46.323 --> 07:48.990
<i>( birds chirping )</i>

07:48.990 --> 07:51.407
I think I've lost him.

07:51.407 --> 07:53.157
Lost him forever.

07:55.240 --> 07:56.490
- Oh.
- You found me.

07:56.490 --> 07:58.490
No, I haven't, 'cause he's right there!

07:58.490 --> 08:01.240
- There he is. Yes, I've gotcha.
- ( Laughing )

08:01.323 --> 08:04.240
I've gotcha, Sprout. You've got
to get better at sneakin' around.

08:04.323 --> 08:06.157
Gotta get better at sneakin'.

08:06.240 --> 08:07.990
Klara DeJong said two Queen's Rangers

08:07.990 --> 08:09.490
were shot dead by the major's men.

08:09.490 --> 08:13.157
No, two rangers are missing.

08:13.157 --> 08:14.490
No shots were fired.

08:14.490 --> 08:16.490
I think Kiara's probably a bit confused.

08:17.990 --> 08:21.323
It is confusing and frightening.

08:21.323 --> 08:23.323
Look, the safest place
to stay out of trouble

08:23.323 --> 08:24.990
- is right here, isn't it?
- ( Door opens )

08:24.990 --> 08:26.490
With your papa. That's where it's safe.

08:26.573 --> 08:27.490
Abraham, you...

08:27.490 --> 08:28.990
<i>( door closes )</i>

08:29.073 --> 08:33.157
I'd like to speak to Abraham
alone, please, if you would.

08:33.157 --> 08:34.657
Of course.

08:34.657 --> 08:37.323
Go with your mom. Go with
your mom. There you go.

08:37.323 --> 08:38.990
Bye-bye.

08:40.823 --> 08:42.490
Please.

08:46.573 --> 08:49.740
We need to compile your
final report from New York.

08:50.657 --> 08:52.323
My... my what?

08:52.407 --> 08:56.823
I intend to send the entire history
of our operation in York City

08:56.823 --> 09:00.657
to General Clinton's special
adjutant, a Major John Andre.

09:00.657 --> 09:02.990
Andre backs Simcoe.

09:03.032 --> 09:06.323
He's the only reason Simcoe was
saved from the court martial

09:06.323 --> 09:08.657
that he so desperately deserves.

09:08.657 --> 09:10.323
The task of the Queen's Rangers

09:10.323 --> 09:12.990
is to root out hidden
conspirators in Long Island.

09:12.990 --> 09:15.990
We know that the real spies,
the truly dangerous ones,

09:15.990 --> 09:17.657
- are in New York.
- Yes... yes, sir.

09:17.657 --> 09:19.240
If I can prove that to Andre,

09:19.240 --> 09:22.490
then he will learn that Simcoe
does not need to remain here

09:22.490 --> 09:25.573
and he will move the Queen's Rangers out.

09:25.657 --> 09:27.657
Um...

09:27.657 --> 09:31.990
but... but my mission was
a... it was a failure, sir.

09:31.990 --> 09:33.740
That's not the point.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.657
Perhaps Andre can find
something in your intelligence.

09:35.657 --> 09:40.240
I need to show Andre that I am
more useful to him than Simcoe.

09:40.323 --> 09:43.157
And you are my best hope of that.

09:43.157 --> 09:45.490
Let's go.

09:45.490 --> 09:47.823
Uh, Major.

09:47.823 --> 09:50.740
Major, please, my... my
time in prison has, uh...

09:50.740 --> 09:52.407
it's played tricks on my mind, all right?

09:52.407 --> 09:56.573
I... I can't recall with any... accuracy

09:56.573 --> 09:59.990
the details before I was detained.

10:00.073 --> 10:02.907
I know what it is like to look back on days

10:02.990 --> 10:04.490
that you would rather forget,

10:04.532 --> 10:08.323
but if we don't act now, there
will be darker days to come.

10:08.323 --> 10:09.907
Take the day to collect yourself,

10:09.907 --> 10:13.990
but I will need your report tonight.

10:18.823 --> 10:21.073
Richard: <i>Run.</i>

10:23.407 --> 10:25.323
What did you say?

10:25.407 --> 10:28.115
Tonight. Don't look back.

10:28.157 --> 10:30.823
<i>You've taken this as far as you can.</i>

10:34.907 --> 10:36.240
Have I?

10:38.573 --> 10:41.573
This person Andre will see right through you

10:41.657 --> 10:42.657
and you know it.

10:42.657 --> 10:45.157
<i>To prove you're not a liar,</i>

10:45.157 --> 10:47.323
<i>you'll have to give up something true,</i>

10:47.323 --> 10:50.990
such as the person you were
really meeting with in New York.

10:53.157 --> 10:55.240
( Sighs )

11:04.823 --> 11:06.157
I don't understand.

11:06.157 --> 11:08.490
Which part?

11:08.573 --> 11:10.407
Silence Hewlett.

11:10.490 --> 11:12.490
Do you mean... you mean kill Hewlett?

11:12.490 --> 11:14.907
I know, it seems impossible,
all right, but it's not.

11:14.990 --> 11:17.240
- ( Scoffs )
- All right, he still fancies you.

11:17.240 --> 11:18.740
So you take him out tonight,

11:18.823 --> 11:21.157
you take him down by the water,
I can get the drop on him.

11:21.157 --> 11:22.823
- No.
- No, no, no, it'll work.

11:22.823 --> 11:25.157
It's gonna work. We just make
it look like Simcoe ordered it

11:25.240 --> 11:26.490
just like we did those other two Rangers.

11:26.573 --> 11:28.157
No, Abe. No, I won't do this.

11:28.157 --> 11:30.157
- I won't take part in this.
- All right, why, why?

11:30.157 --> 11:32.907
Because it's murder and
it's done in cold blood.

11:35.907 --> 11:39.407
What? So, then you... you're
not hearing me, all right?

11:39.490 --> 11:43.157
Hewlett plans to pass on my name to Andre.

11:43.240 --> 11:45.073
You remember him from New York?

11:45.157 --> 11:48.740
Listen, when he hears the name
Woodhull again, when he hears Setauket,

11:48.740 --> 11:51.573
where he already sent Robert Rogers to
look into the ambush that we planned...

11:51.657 --> 11:53.157
There has to be another way.

11:53.157 --> 11:55.323
<i>Edmund is...</i>

11:55.323 --> 11:56.740
he's not...

11:56.740 --> 11:59.573
- Wait, Edmund?
- Major Hewlett.

11:59.657 --> 12:02.073
Yes, Major Hewlett of
His Majesty's Royal Army.

12:02.157 --> 12:04.657
Have you forgotten who our enemy is?

12:06.990 --> 12:09.157
Have you forgotten we're at war?

12:10.823 --> 12:12.823
You've changed.

12:12.823 --> 12:15.490
Ever since you got out of
prison you're different.

12:15.490 --> 12:17.240
Yeah, prison will do that to you.

12:19.823 --> 12:22.823
Are you gonna help me get this done...

12:22.823 --> 12:24.157
or not?

12:29.157 --> 12:31.740
All right.

12:31.782 --> 12:34.990
You'd better run along
before he gets suspicious.

12:44.323 --> 12:48.657
( Blade scraping )

12:54.073 --> 12:56.740
<i>( door opens )</i>

12:56.740 --> 12:59.490
<i>( birds chirping )</i>

13:22.324 --> 13:24.778
<i>( Man shouting orders )</i>

13:28.038 --> 13:30.413
Ah, there you are.

13:30.455 --> 13:32.705
Did you find your escort to be satisfactory?

13:32.746 --> 13:34.663
They were well-armed.

13:34.705 --> 13:38.330
- Is there a problem, General?
- Not at all, my dear.

13:42.705 --> 13:44.205
Father.

13:44.246 --> 13:46.288
Good day, Margaret.

13:46.330 --> 13:48.330
Fantastic day.

13:48.371 --> 13:51.163
Shall we give her the news?

13:51.205 --> 13:53.371
Yes, well...

13:53.413 --> 13:56.413
after happy discussion
with this fine gentleman,

13:56.455 --> 13:58.746
I have given my blessing.

13:58.788 --> 14:01.663
We shall be married straightaway.

14:01.663 --> 14:05.580
Now, tell me, how do you feel?

14:05.621 --> 14:07.788
I... I...

14:07.830 --> 14:10.163
( laughs ) She is so elated,
she can hardly speak.

14:10.205 --> 14:12.788
- Truly.
- Come.

14:12.830 --> 14:14.996
When was this decided?

14:14.996 --> 14:17.080
- Arnold: Just now. Here.
- <i>( Door opens )</i>

14:17.121 --> 14:20.080
- A toast...
- Sir?

14:20.121 --> 14:21.330
Major Wells to see you.

14:21.371 --> 14:23.038
Not now, Francis.

14:23.080 --> 14:26.496
He claims it's urgent, sir.

14:26.538 --> 14:28.371
Urgent.

14:28.413 --> 14:33.038
A word thrown hastily by an
officer who has never seen combat.

14:33.080 --> 14:36.288
Excuse me for a moment. I must
administer a chastisement.

14:40.496 --> 14:41.830
You gave your blessing?

14:41.830 --> 14:44.288
- <i> ( Door closes )</i>
- Don't act so surprised.

14:44.330 --> 14:47.455
I hope you're proud of the
position you put me in.

14:47.496 --> 14:49.913
I don't like being threatened.

14:49.955 --> 14:52.538
What do you mean? Father, what did he say?

14:52.580 --> 14:56.580
It wasn't what he said so
much as what he insinuated.

14:56.621 --> 14:59.455
A husband's duty is to
protect his wife and family.

14:59.496 --> 15:02.788
And, as military governor,
he would see to it

15:02.830 --> 15:05.163
that our family was protected

15:05.163 --> 15:08.330
from the patriot mob who now rule this city.

15:09.705 --> 15:12.330
- I cannot marry that man.
- <i>( Marching footsteps )</i>

15:12.371 --> 15:15.996
But he told me that he'd already proposed

15:16.038 --> 15:17.580
and you eagerly accepted.

15:17.621 --> 15:19.913
No, I... I did not.

15:19.955 --> 15:21.455
I will not.

15:21.496 --> 15:23.913
Well, then tell him so.

15:23.955 --> 15:25.580
I don't wish the son of an apothecary

15:25.621 --> 15:26.788
into this family any more than you do.

15:26.830 --> 15:29.955
- I can't tell him no.
- Why not?

15:29.996 --> 15:32.996
Because it will insult him
and I will lose his friendship.

15:33.038 --> 15:34.913
So?

15:34.955 --> 15:36.580
It's complicated, Father.

15:36.621 --> 15:39.455
You... you couldn't understand.

15:39.496 --> 15:44.163
Then help me understand.

15:44.163 --> 15:47.288
Why do you require his friendship?

15:47.330 --> 15:49.580
- <i>( Door opens )</i>
- ( Gasps )

15:52.205 --> 15:56.205
Oh, she just went to tell
her sisters the happy news.

15:56.246 --> 15:59.163
- Ah.
- <i> She's a very...</i>

15:59.163 --> 16:02.413
exuberant young lady, you'll come to find.

16:02.455 --> 16:05.038
One of the many reasons why I love her.

16:07.121 --> 16:10.413
- ( Chatter )
- <i>( Horse whinnies )</i>

16:14.871 --> 16:17.121
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

16:21.038 --> 16:23.621
Cicero: <i>M-Mama?</i>

16:23.663 --> 16:25.413
Hi, Mama.

16:26.496 --> 16:28.955
( laughing )

16:37.788 --> 16:39.580
Hey, Abby.

16:41.871 --> 16:43.830
It's all right, Mama. He brought me here.

16:43.830 --> 16:45.496
All the way from Setauket.

16:45.538 --> 16:48.580
"All right, Mama." Listen to you now.

16:48.621 --> 16:50.996
He's getting big, eh?

16:50.996 --> 16:52.705
What's that you wearin', Jordan?

16:52.746 --> 16:55.163
They got you workin'
as some kind of soldier?

16:55.163 --> 16:56.830
Queen's Ranger.

16:56.871 --> 17:00.663
Don't dig ditches no more, but I do
dig graves for those who cross me.

17:00.663 --> 17:02.705
And humble as ever.

17:02.746 --> 17:05.663
I don't need to be. I got my freedom papers.

17:05.704 --> 17:07.371
I don't look down for no one.

17:07.413 --> 17:09.288
You see me lookin' down?

17:09.329 --> 17:12.246
Major Andre pays me for my work.

17:12.288 --> 17:14.996
We've both come a long
way since Selah Strong.

17:14.996 --> 17:17.121
I didn't come here to argue.

17:17.163 --> 17:19.204
Then why'd you come here?

17:20.163 --> 17:21.788
To take you North.

17:21.829 --> 17:24.246
<i>Now, if we're free, we should go free.</i>

17:24.288 --> 17:28.121
Right now, today, all of us.

17:28.163 --> 17:29.538
Where would we go?

17:29.580 --> 17:32.538
You heard of Canada? I know the way.

17:32.580 --> 17:35.455
You got your boy back. What
else you got to stay here for?

17:36.496 --> 17:38.830
Uh...

17:38.871 --> 17:41.830
like you said, I got my boy back now.

17:41.871 --> 17:43.705
I can't think about running.

17:43.746 --> 17:45.580
Not yet.

17:48.705 --> 17:51.496
You... you wanna think, think.

17:51.538 --> 17:54.288
But know this... I'm gonna
come back to New York soon,

17:54.330 --> 17:57.955
and when I do, be ready.

18:00.371 --> 18:02.163
Akinbode.

18:15.788 --> 18:17.663
Thank you.

18:23.246 --> 18:27.080
Hey, you take care of her, yeah?

18:38.496 --> 18:41.621
Abraham: <i> After my arrest, they
probably moved quiet altogether, sir.</i>

18:41.663 --> 18:45.705
Well, are we finished, then?

18:48.496 --> 18:50.580
If that's all you need, sir, yeah.

18:50.621 --> 18:52.371
I think so.

18:54.455 --> 18:57.038
Well, you mustn't blame yourself
for being an imperfect spy.

18:57.080 --> 19:00.330
It's a dirty business, after all.

19:00.330 --> 19:05.663
Major Andre should be very
interested in this intrigue nonetheless.

19:05.663 --> 19:08.830
Um, how will you, uh...

19:08.830 --> 19:11.288
<i>how will you get all this to New York?</i>

19:11.330 --> 19:15.580
You mean how can I make sure that
Simcoe doesn't try to intercept it?

19:15.621 --> 19:19.163
I'll send a trusted courier
to carry the letter,

19:19.205 --> 19:20.913
likely Corporal Eastin.

19:20.955 --> 19:22.996
He's made the trip several times now,

19:22.996 --> 19:24.788
and I plan to encrypt the message...

19:24.830 --> 19:28.205
- <i>( drawer scrapes )</i>
- ...with this.

19:31.080 --> 19:32.788
What's that, sir?

19:32.830 --> 19:34.830
It's called a Cardan Grille,

19:34.871 --> 19:39.663
named after the Renaissance
astrologer Gerolamo Cardano.

19:39.663 --> 19:43.121
Cloaks a secret message
inside an ordinary one,

19:43.163 --> 19:45.913
<i>which only a matching grille can reveal.</i>

19:45.955 --> 19:50.288
It usually takes several drafts
to compose a proper mask letter.

19:50.330 --> 19:53.580
It may be too dull for you
to watch, so don't mind me.

19:53.621 --> 19:55.830
You've earned your rest.

19:55.871 --> 19:57.746
Whatever your misgivings, Abraham,

19:57.788 --> 20:00.955
know that you have done well.

20:00.996 --> 20:03.121
<i>( Knock at door )</i>

20:09.121 --> 20:10.580
( inhales deeply )

20:12.746 --> 20:14.663
Forgive me, but Thomas isn't well.

20:14.663 --> 20:16.371
I think he may have a fever.

20:16.413 --> 20:17.746
What? He was fine this morning.

20:17.788 --> 20:19.330
I may be wrong. Will you
please come and look?

20:19.330 --> 20:21.205
- Yeah.
- It's quite all right.

20:21.246 --> 20:24.163
We're done here. I can finish up on my own.

20:26.163 --> 20:27.705
Okay.

20:36.455 --> 20:38.580
Well, where is he?

20:41.163 --> 20:43.330
Anna came to me and told me
what you intend on doing.

20:43.330 --> 20:46.330
She already knows I'm
involved with the ring.

20:46.330 --> 20:48.330
We can't let you do this, Abe.

20:48.371 --> 20:50.246
- No.
- You do not have to kill Hewlett.

20:50.288 --> 20:52.121
- Oh, I don't? I don't have to?
- No. No.

20:52.163 --> 20:53.913
All right, then why don't you
tell me what I have to do?

20:53.955 --> 20:55.871
You only have to kill his courier.

20:55.913 --> 20:58.871
- What?
- Think about it.

20:58.913 --> 21:01.038
Hewlett will likely send one courier

21:01.080 --> 21:02.788
as he can't afford to spare
a whole detachment.

21:02.830 --> 21:04.955
Eastin, yeah.

21:04.996 --> 21:06.830
You get ahead of him on
the road, you ambush him,

21:06.830 --> 21:08.121
make it look like Simcoe did it,

21:08.163 --> 21:10.038
revenge for the men that he lost.

21:10.080 --> 21:12.913
Mary, I came to you for help.

21:12.913 --> 21:15.871
- You did the right thing.
- Wait, what about Andre?

21:15.913 --> 21:17.996
Hewlett will just send another courier.

21:17.996 --> 21:20.246
( Sobbing ) Please don't do this.

21:20.288 --> 21:22.455
Why not? Eastin's a rat.

21:22.496 --> 21:24.996
He's the one that tried to kill
my father under Simcoe's orders.

21:25.038 --> 21:26.830
There is no one more deserving than Eastin.

21:26.871 --> 21:29.955
What changed for you?

21:29.996 --> 21:31.496
What happened to "Raid the armory,

21:31.496 --> 21:33.621
storm the church, shoot Hewlett"?

21:36.038 --> 21:39.121
Did you find some hidden love for the king?

21:42.455 --> 21:44.080
Or is it just for Hewlett?

21:56.371 --> 21:58.663
You forge a response.

22:00.330 --> 22:02.580
What? ( scoffs )

22:02.621 --> 22:06.913
The story will be that Eastin was
ambushed returning from New York.

22:06.955 --> 22:09.496
You forge a letter from Andre
thanking him for his efforts,

22:09.538 --> 22:11.163
but making it very clear
that he's not interested...

22:11.163 --> 22:12.746
- No.
- in pursuing the matter any further.

22:12.788 --> 22:14.246
Hewlett won't dare to challenge him.

22:14.288 --> 22:18.455
Listen to me. Hewlett will be expecting
a message that is encrypted.

22:18.496 --> 22:20.455
What do you mean?

22:21.830 --> 22:23.288
Why are you doing this?

22:23.330 --> 22:25.455
Huh?

22:28.163 --> 22:30.246
Why did you change sides?

22:32.746 --> 22:35.996
I haven't changed sides, Abe.

22:35.996 --> 22:39.663
I don't believe in your
cause, I believe in you.

22:39.705 --> 22:42.205
And I'm done trying to change you.

22:44.663 --> 22:48.330
Though I do think I can help
you be a little less sloppy.

22:48.371 --> 22:51.913
Now, your father keeps
a pistol in the house.

22:51.955 --> 22:53.788
I know where it is.

22:56.663 --> 22:59.913
- It's going to be all right, I promise.
- I know it is.

- Hey, Ben, what's new?

24:00.251 --> 24:01.626
Where in God's name have you been?

24:01.668 --> 24:03.626
I thought you were stuck at
the bottom of New York Harbor.

24:03.668 --> 24:06.710
Have I got a story for you, read this.
Hang on.

24:06.751 --> 24:08.501
Forward march!

24:10.626 --> 24:12.001
Where's Washington?

24:12.043 --> 24:14.668
He's with the main company a day behind us.

24:16.960 --> 24:20.501
Ben, he's in danger. It's an inside job.

24:20.543 --> 24:22.710
Oh, God. I knew it.

24:22.751 --> 24:25.085
What do you mean? I just
got it from Long Island.

24:30.210 --> 24:31.751
It's a trap.

24:31.793 --> 24:33.751
Lee's marching us straight into it.

26:23.376 --> 26:26.168
- Hold the line!
- Hold the line!

26:26.210 --> 26:27.876
- ( Shouting )
- Ben: <i> Stand fast, men!</i>

26:27.918 --> 26:31.835
- <i> Stand fast!</i>
- Soldier: <i> Retreat!</i>

26:31.876 --> 26:34.293
( gunfire continues )

26:39.251 --> 26:41.293
Ben: General Lee, sir!

26:41.335 --> 26:44.960
Generals Wayne, Scott, and Maxwell
are withdrawing through the orchard

26:45.001 --> 26:46.710
and all our men are falling back at once.

26:46.751 --> 26:48.251
Yes, I know. I ordered them.

26:48.251 --> 26:51.251
But, sir, if we do not rally the men

26:51.293 --> 26:53.918
and form a defensive line, we
will not be able to hold them.

26:53.960 --> 26:56.543
Hold them? Hold them how?

26:56.585 --> 26:59.835
Clinton has sprung a trap
and we are outnumbered.

26:59.876 --> 27:01.168
Retreat is our only option.

27:01.210 --> 27:03.960
Washington expects us to hold.

27:04.001 --> 27:08.668
Colonel Bradford, if Major
Tallmadge does not clear the road,

27:08.710 --> 27:11.835
he is to be hanged from
that tree as a deserter!

27:11.876 --> 27:13.210
A deserter?

27:16.501 --> 27:19.085
<i>( Horses approaching )</i>

27:27.335 --> 27:29.210
<i>( horse nickers )</i>

27:33.085 --> 27:36.751
General Lee, I've had a
most disturbing report

27:36.751 --> 27:40.585
from a young fifer traveling in the
wrong direction from the battle.

27:40.626 --> 27:43.168
Sir, I... I thought you a day behind us.

27:43.210 --> 27:45.918
Why are your men in retreat?

27:45.918 --> 27:49.835
They... there has been some confusion, sir.

27:49.876 --> 27:51.335
There remains some.

27:51.335 --> 27:54.251
Why are your men in retreat?

27:54.251 --> 27:56.751
Circumstances prevented a proper advance

27:56.793 --> 28:00.585
and I did not think a major action

28:00.626 --> 28:03.126
was in the best interest
of America at this time.

28:03.168 --> 28:04.876
You did not think?!

28:04.918 --> 28:09.085
You damned poltroon! You never tried them!

28:11.668 --> 28:13.460
You should not have requested this command

28:13.501 --> 28:16.085
if you did not intend to attack!

28:16.126 --> 28:19.085
<i>What the hell are you about, man?</i>

28:19.085 --> 28:20.751
I apologize, Your Excellency.

28:20.751 --> 28:23.168
- To the rear, sir.
- Sir... sir...

28:23.210 --> 28:25.960
I said to the rear!

28:26.001 --> 28:27.543
( Whistles )

28:27.585 --> 28:30.335
<i>( distant gunfire )</i>

28:48.418 --> 28:51.126
Colonel Bradford, how far are their cavalry?

28:51.168 --> 28:52.543
15 minutes, sir.

28:52.585 --> 28:54.585
Washington: <i>I want both these
detachments into the woods</i>

28:54.585 --> 28:56.835
to ambush the nearer of their columns.

28:56.876 --> 29:00.626
Major, ride out to General
Wayne and General Scott.

29:00.668 --> 29:02.585
Have them hold up the enemy

29:02.626 --> 29:05.585
while I form a defensive
line with artillery.

29:05.626 --> 29:13.210
Yes, sir.

29:13.251 --> 29:14.876
Yes.

32:10.537 --> 32:13.287
And I'm excited for you, for us.

32:13.287 --> 32:14.954
Yes, yes.

32:16.454 --> 32:19.204
And it will only get better from here.

32:19.287 --> 32:21.120
I've found us a mansion on Market Street,

32:21.120 --> 32:22.870
a far nicer home than this.

32:22.870 --> 32:24.870
We can have the wedding there next week.

32:24.870 --> 32:27.287
I can't be married next week.

32:30.620 --> 32:33.287
That did not come out the way I intended it.

32:33.287 --> 32:35.620
Oh. And what did you intend?

32:35.620 --> 32:39.454
All I meant to ask of you is
if we may delay our nuptials

32:39.537 --> 32:42.787
until my sister Elizabeth...
my eldest sister Elizabeth...

32:42.787 --> 32:44.120
can be married.

32:44.120 --> 32:46.454
Ah, I see.

32:46.454 --> 32:48.704
And when is her happy day planned?

32:48.704 --> 32:51.537
Well, she is not engaged yet, so to speak.

32:51.537 --> 32:54.037
Not engaged? Well, why not?

32:54.120 --> 32:56.287
I've seen your sister. She is a fine woman.

32:56.287 --> 32:58.620
Betsy's suitor was a royal officer who left

32:58.620 --> 33:00.620
when the King's Army evacuated.

33:00.704 --> 33:04.120
She doesn't know if or when he'll return.

33:04.120 --> 33:05.870
It's been dreadfully trying for all of us...

33:05.954 --> 33:08.704
So she is not engaged and has no suitor?

33:08.704 --> 33:12.537
When do you suggest we delay
the wedding until? Christmas?

33:12.620 --> 33:15.120
- I cannot say.
- A year from Christmas?!

33:15.120 --> 33:16.620
Please don't shout.

33:16.662 --> 33:18.120
Then give me a clear answer.

33:18.120 --> 33:21.037
Do you wish to be married or not?

33:22.870 --> 33:24.787
More than you can imagine.

33:24.870 --> 33:26.287
Then why wait?

33:26.287 --> 33:28.620
I, for one, am through with standing silent

33:28.704 --> 33:31.454
waiting patiently for
what I deserve now, today.

33:36.954 --> 33:40.620
Who said anything about waiting?

33:42.870 --> 33:46.537
If you wish to marry into
a Philadelphia family,

33:46.537 --> 33:50.412
you must adapt to Philadelphia customs.

33:52.204 --> 33:55.704
We may have to wait for our wedding day.

33:57.370 --> 33:59.537
But that doesn't mean we have to wait

33:59.537 --> 34:02.079
for our wedding night.

34:03.870 --> 34:07.537
I can't wait that long for you.

34:09.954 --> 34:13.786
Of course, no one can
know about this but us.

34:13.870 --> 34:16.286
Of course.

34:21.704 --> 34:23.954
So, you see, the actual date...

34:23.954 --> 34:28.286
No, of course. Whatever you think is best.

34:30.786 --> 34:33.704
<i>( Music playing )</i>

34:58.454 --> 35:01.704
- To, um...
- <i>( Marching footsteps )</i>

35:01.787 --> 35:04.954
( chuckles ) To New York City.

35:12.120 --> 35:14.787
Leave it.

35:14.787 --> 35:17.037
A testament to my shattered ambitions...

35:18.204 --> 35:21.037
and all I've let slip from my grasp.

35:21.954 --> 35:23.370
As you wish, sir.

35:23.370 --> 35:26.787
Why didn't you stop me, Abigail?

35:26.787 --> 35:28.287
Sir?

35:31.787 --> 35:34.037
I should never have left
her in Philadelphia.

35:39.537 --> 35:40.870
And now I've left her in the hands

35:40.870 --> 35:44.995
of that great blue bear,

35:45.037 --> 35:50.620
a wounded shell of vanity and lust.

35:51.954 --> 35:55.954
She'll turn him, like she turned me.

35:55.954 --> 35:57.745
Changed me.

35:59.162 --> 36:02.745
I believe in Peggy more than anyone.

36:02.787 --> 36:05.620
She won't give up until she delivers him...

36:05.620 --> 36:08.412
and he delivers Washington.

36:15.204 --> 36:17.287
( Grunts )

36:18.787 --> 36:22.120
To General Benedict Arnold.

36:23.204 --> 36:27.204
May his treachery bring us victory,

36:27.204 --> 36:30.370
and may victory bring me Peggy.

36:53.537 --> 36:55.954
( Sobbing )

36:59.537 --> 37:01.579
None of our business.

37:08.287 --> 37:11.204
Now, remember, travel safe.

37:11.287 --> 37:15.704
You know me, sir... I take the
safest and dullest route possible.

37:15.704 --> 37:19.287
<i>( Door opens, closes )</i>

37:21.204 --> 37:23.370
Have you seen your husband?

37:23.454 --> 37:25.537
Yes. He took Thomas down to the water.

37:25.537 --> 37:27.370
He wanted to teach him how to skip stones.

37:27.454 --> 37:30.537
Ah. Have you seen my pistol,

37:30.537 --> 37:33.037
the one I kept in the study?

37:33.120 --> 37:36.037
Ask Aberdeen. She might
have moved it while dusting.

37:41.120 --> 37:43.537
<i>( Door opens, closes )</i>

37:43.537 --> 37:45.620
You can come out now.

37:49.120 --> 37:50.870

37:50.870 --> 37:53.120
And now, Grandpa's going to hide,

37:53.204 --> 37:55.037
and then later we'll look for him.

Ah, Bradford.

39:16.198 --> 39:18.448
You survived.

39:18.531 --> 39:21.531
Disappointed?

39:21.531 --> 39:24.615
Hey, where are you going?

39:25.448 --> 39:27.115

39:27.115 --> 39:30.615
Come face me, you stinking Judas!

Odd, you should use that word.

But if you'd just please
tell him that I have

39:51.365 --> 39:53.031
some urgent news I have to discuss...

39:53.031 --> 39:55.531
The general wishes to see Major Tallmadge.

39:57.198 --> 39:59.115
Major Tallmadge, General.

40:01.615 --> 40:03.531
Ben: <i>Well, congratulations, General.</i>

40:03.615 --> 40:05.781
You've claimed the first
victory of the year.

40:05.781 --> 40:07.531
It was the army's victory,

40:07.615 --> 40:10.573
and that only in the most
forgiving sense of the word.

40:10.615 --> 40:13.615
We turned them, sir.

40:13.615 --> 40:15.281
We saw their backs.

40:15.281 --> 40:18.031
<i>They won't soon forget
that, and neither will we.</i>

40:20.281 --> 40:22.948
A symbolic victory, then.

40:22.948 --> 40:25.615
<i>( Pen scratching )</i>

40:25.615 --> 40:28.323
Your Excellency, there's
something I have to ask you.

40:28.365 --> 40:30.698
How long did I know that General Lee

40:30.740 --> 40:33.615
was in communication with the enemy?

40:39.115 --> 40:41.781
Ever since you passed along the message

40:41.865 --> 40:45.615
from 3-5-5 in Philadelphia.

40:45.615 --> 40:48.906
- But, sir, you...
- Merely had to wait

40:48.948 --> 40:51.031
for the proper time to deal with him,

40:51.115 --> 40:53.781
and with the proper amount of discretion.

40:53.865 --> 40:55.281
Like a public shaming?

40:55.281 --> 40:57.948
Better he be court-martialed as a failure

40:58.031 --> 40:59.781
than as a traitor.

40:59.781 --> 41:02.615
There can be no security

41:02.615 --> 41:05.198
without secrecy.

41:05.198 --> 41:07.781
Indeed. I agree, sir.

41:07.781 --> 41:10.281
The value of secrecy

41:10.365 --> 41:13.365
is why I've come to you tonight.

41:13.365 --> 41:15.781
I have news from Culper.

41:21.281 --> 41:23.031
Thanks to your pardoning Hewlett,

41:23.115 --> 41:25.781
Culper was freed and he
maintained his cover.

41:25.781 --> 41:27.281
Now he can't go back to New York,

41:27.281 --> 41:29.031
but that's no longer necessary,

41:29.073 --> 41:31.198
as we have a new man in the city...

41:31.281 --> 41:33.115
Robert Townsend.

41:33.198 --> 41:35.865
We refer to him as "Sam Culper, Jr."

41:35.906 --> 41:37.698
And he's already provided proof

41:37.698 --> 41:40.281
of a conspiracy against you, sir.

41:42.031 --> 41:43.224
Conspiracy?

41:43.224 --> 41:46.220
Billy, would you call in
the Life Guard, please?

41:58.948 --> 42:02.781
Sergeant Hickey, Sergeant McPherson.

42:02.781 --> 42:04.865
Our new agent in New York

42:04.948 --> 42:06.615
overheard a conspiracy plot

42:06.615 --> 42:08.281
as it was being discussed openly

42:08.323 --> 42:10.781
in the heart of enemy territory.

42:10.865 --> 42:14.031
Now, he didn't catch the names
of all of the conspirators,

42:14.031 --> 42:17.865
but we do have one of them
under guard, right now.

42:19.906 --> 42:23.698
It's Lee's man... William Bradford.

42:24.906 --> 42:26.698
- Where are you holding him?
- No, sir...

42:26.781 --> 42:29.781
I can't allow you to leave
this tent, for your own safety.

42:29.781 --> 42:32.115
Not until we identify the assassin.

42:32.115 --> 42:36.531
So, by your leave, my counsel is
to have one of your Life Guard

42:36.531 --> 42:39.698
quietly escort Bradford here.

42:39.698 --> 42:41.615
Discreetly.

42:41.615 --> 42:43.281
I'll fetch him.

42:49.781 --> 42:51.698
Now, according to "Culper, Jr.,"

42:51.698 --> 42:53.198
the chief architects of the plot

42:53.198 --> 42:55.615
are Royal Governor Tryon and David Matthews,

42:55.615 --> 42:57.365
<i>the acting mayor of New York.</i>

42:57.448 --> 42:59.948
<i>They're privately funding
a cabal within our camp...</i>

42:59.948 --> 43:02.531
<i>right now, right here... under your nose.</i>

43:02.531 --> 43:05.281
<i>It's all there in the report, sir.</i>

43:08.615 --> 43:11.531
Sorry. I have to do this.

43:11.615 --> 43:13.198
It will be the end of both of us if I don't.

43:13.198 --> 43:16.698
- ( Gasps )
- Drop it.

43:18.115 --> 43:20.865
- ( Bayonet rings )
- Now.

43:23.115 --> 43:25.115
<i>( Faint singing continues )</i>

43:25.115 --> 43:27.865
( Caleb whistling )

43:39.323 --> 43:40.865
<i>( footsteps approaching )</i>

43:42.698 --> 43:45.365
Sir...

43:45.448 --> 43:47.115
they're secure.

43:48.865 --> 43:51.031
Make sure.

43:56.448 --> 43:58.448
Sergeant Hickey.

43:58.448 --> 44:01.365
There are other charges they
can be brought up on, sir.

44:01.365 --> 44:03.115
Counterfeiting, for one.

44:03.115 --> 44:05.448
They can both be hanged
and no one will ever know

44:05.531 --> 44:07.531
how close they came.

44:10.740 --> 44:12.781
Thank you, Benjamin.

44:12.781 --> 44:15.115
No, thank Brewster and Townsend.

44:15.115 --> 44:16.781
And Woody...

44:16.781 --> 44:19.448
I mean, Woodhull, sir.

44:24.115 --> 44:26.615
So, 7-2-1,

44:26.698 --> 44:30.948
<i>do you trust the integrity
of the Culper ring, then?</i>

44:31.031 --> 44:34.615
With my life, sir, and yours.

44:35.948 --> 44:38.948
As you said, secrecy is the key to security.

44:38.948 --> 44:40.115
( Door closes )

44:40.115 --> 44:42.365
Ben: <i>As long as the ring is secret,</i>

44:42.448 --> 44:44.740
<i>it is secure.</i>

44:44.781 --> 44:47.948
( panting )

44:53.323 --> 44:55.365
Kept this safe, did ya?

44:56.281 --> 45:00.031
( Panting, coughing )

45:00.031 --> 45:03.615
I'll be taking it back
now, if you don't mind.

45:07.865 --> 45:10.281
I'm sorry to deny you

45:10.323 --> 45:13.115
success on your little
mission on the road today,

45:13.115 --> 45:14.698
but, then, that's life, ain't it?

45:14.781 --> 45:18.281
We're all denied everything
we don't take for ourselves.

45:18.323 --> 45:21.865
- ( Gasping )
- ( Laughing )

45:21.906 --> 45:24.698
I always knew there was
something wrong with ya.

45:24.740 --> 45:27.615
<i>Ever since John Andre</i>

45:27.615 --> 45:30.031
<i>sent me to this backwater.</i>

45:32.948 --> 45:34.934
And now...

45:34.934 --> 45:38.844
I'm sure he will live
to regret his decision,

45:38.844 --> 45:41.968
because I have found

45:41.968 --> 45:45.583
what he was looking for after all.

45:46.134 --> 45:49.793
You and your plucky
young freedom fighters.

45:49.793 --> 45:51.444
the tavern wench,

45:51.444 --> 45:55.028
the smuggler, the cavalry lad...

45:55.028 --> 45:56.919
( Coughing )

45:56.919 --> 46:00.704
and the farmer who can't catch a harvest.

46:01.864 --> 46:06.179
all of Georgie's bastard children.

46:08.359 --> 46:11.190
See, you're the thing

46:11.190 --> 46:13.244
<i>Andre wants most in the world.</i>

46:13.244 --> 46:15.563
And what I want most

46:16.145 --> 46:18.984
is my revenge on him.

46:19.939 --> 46:22.789
So let an old trapper

46:23.644 --> 46:27.010
show you how to set a proper trap.
