* Da da-da *

* Hey, Macarena *

I can't believe she's 13.
That's crazy.

09:15.430 --> 09:17.349
That's insane.
She's so young. I had no idea.

09:17.390 --> 09:20.310
I mean, it sounded young,
but I didn't think 13.

09:20.352 --> 09:22.103
I auditioned for "X Factor"
when I was 15.

09:22.145 --> 09:24.314
Really? Right, right.
I didn't make it
as an individual.

09:24.356 --> 09:26.232
I was in Fifth Harmony.
John: I was just proud

09:26.274 --> 09:29.194

Spanish that was being spoken.

* Can't you see,
oh, can't you see *

09:36.409 --> 09:40.747
* Don't speak,

09:40.789 --> 09:42.624
Your voice,
it sounds like a record.

09:42.665 --> 09:44.250
It sounds like
a Grammy performance.

09:44.292 --> 09:47.170
Daly: ...the rivalry among
our coaches is in full force.

09:47.212 --> 09:50.256
John Legend can kiss my ass.
Oh, my goodness.

09:50.298 --> 09:53.093
I literally don't think
John can beat Camila.

09:53.134 --> 09:54.803

Camila: This is a moment,

09:54.844 --> 09:56.846
because we're besties.

Yeah!
Daly: ...anything can happen.

10:00.475 --> 10:01.601
You talking about
Team Blocked?

10:01.643 --> 10:02.852
Yes, Team Blocked.

10:02.894 --> 10:04.020
I don't have a chance
to fight for him.

10:04.062 --> 10:05.772
Oh, you know --
I'm so sorry.

of the blind auditions.

10:19.828 --> 10:22.664
For your first time here,
you're slicing it.

10:22.706 --> 10:23.998
You're doing a great job.
Thank you.

I'm -- I'm amazed, like,
how you're doing.

10:25.667 --> 10:26.918

Today, I'm gonna have to

10:26.960 --> 10:28.753
maybe, like --
Like, we're --

10:28.795 --> 10:30.171
Like, are we
in an alliance?

10:30.213 --> 10:31.756
Oh, oh, you were saying
the opposite. This is awkward.

10:31.798 --> 10:33.091
Oh, no, no, no.
She's saying the opposite.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.467
Oh, she saying
she's gonna have to fight me.

10:34.509 --> 10:36.177
A little bit. I mean --
Okay, that's fine.

10:36.219 --> 10:38.680
Don't trust in these alliances.
We ain't loyal.

Bryce: There's no better feeling
than firing up

10:44.978 --> 10:47.564
an old three-speed tractor
and cutting some grass

10:47.605 --> 10:50.692
and listening to country music.
It makes you feel free.

10:50.734 --> 10:53.695
* It's been a good, good ride *

10:53.737 --> 10:55.196
My name is Bryce Leatherwood.

10:55.238 --> 10:57.490
I'm 22 years old,
and I'm from Woodstock, Georgia.

10:57.532 --> 11:00.702
As a kid, I would always go
to my granddad's farm.

11:00.744 --> 11:03.872
We rode around in his truck
with a bunch of cassette tapes,

11:03.913 --> 11:05.457
from George Jones
to Conway Twitty.

11:05.498 --> 11:08.209
He got me hooked on country
at a young age.

11:08.251 --> 11:12.297
When he was small, we'd sing
together, going down the road.

11:12.339 --> 11:14.674
Don't get no better
than that.

11:14.716 --> 11:18.094
Well, I'm very lucky to still
have my grandfather here.

11:18.136 --> 11:20.555
He was a firefighter
for 25 years.

11:20.597 --> 11:25.185
After that, he sadly attained
Stage IV lung cancer.

11:25.226 --> 11:27.187
He had said he didn't want
to do chemotherapy.

11:27.228 --> 11:28.772
My mother said, "Well, Daddy,

11:28.813 --> 11:31.566
you've got a grandson, and
you got one more on the way."

11:31.608 --> 11:34.319
He started doing chemotherapy,
and after a bunch of surgeries

11:34.361 --> 11:36.237
and everything,
he finally beat it.

11:36.279 --> 11:38.948
He says the reason that he's
alive today is because of me.

11:38.990 --> 11:41.618
Well, we come a long way, man.
Yeah, we have.

11:41.659 --> 11:44.371
My grandfather is one of
the biggest heroes of my life.

11:44.412 --> 11:46.122
You know,
it makes it feel good

11:46.164 --> 11:48.416
to have my grandson
say that.

11:48.458 --> 11:50.251
I didn't know...

11:50.293 --> 11:52.754
that he really felt that
about me.

11:52.796 --> 11:54.589
I'm glad to know it.

11:54.631 --> 11:57.592
My favorite part about being
at my granddad's farm

11:57.634 --> 11:59.594
was learning how to work hard.

11:59.636 --> 12:03.098
I started my own lawn care
company when I was 13 years old.

12:03.139 --> 12:04.432
Started with a few houses.

12:04.474 --> 12:07.268
From there,
went to 5 to 10 to 20.

12:07.310 --> 12:09.104
I call it
Leatherwood Landscaping.

12:09.145 --> 12:11.356
Once I got to college,
my brother's taken that over

12:11.398 --> 12:14.192
and changed it all up. He wanted
to be Lance Landscaping.

12:14.234 --> 12:16.277
I'm like, "Dude,
you got a sweet last name

12:16.319 --> 12:18.822
that literally has
two things from nature."

12:18.863 --> 12:22.033
But he blew it up, made
the company what it is today.

12:23.326 --> 12:25.578
Going to college,
fell in love with music there.

12:25.620 --> 12:28.873
Started at small, little pubs
to the biggest bars in town,

12:28.915 --> 12:31.209
and I get paid to sing my songs.

12:31.251 --> 12:32.919
Can't be nothing
better than that.

12:32.961 --> 12:34.963
Did you ever think you'd be
getting ready

12:35.005 --> 12:36.256
to sing for "The Voice"?

12:36.297 --> 12:38.383
Not in a million years did I.
Okay.

12:39.175 --> 12:41.511
Two weeks ago,
I graduated college,

12:41.553 --> 12:43.054
and I have no other job.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.472

I see fit.

"Goodbye Time" by Conway Twitty,

12:51.146 --> 12:53.189
but I'll be doing
the Blake Shelton version.

12:53.231 --> 12:56.067

with singing a coach's song.

44:59.783 --> 45:02.410
so this is -- This is a thing.
[ <i>Ding! Ding!</i>]

45:02.452 --> 45:05.580
First of all, I had like
a year in fourth grade

45:05.622 --> 45:06.664
where I played the cello,

45:06.706 --> 45:09.084
if that means anything to you.
It does.

45:09.125 --> 45:12.420
But you are a cool, cool cat.
Thank you.

45:12.462 --> 45:15.090
I -- John and I turned
at the exact same time,

45:15.131 --> 45:16.591
so he can't be like,
"I turned around first."

45:16.633 --> 45:18.259
I think I was slightly
ahead of her. Slightly.

45:18.301 --> 45:22.806
Not really. The fact
that you could make it so cool

45:22.847 --> 45:26.768
without any riffs or runs at
first -- It was just your tone.

45:26.810 --> 45:30.355
And then you did this, like,
one crazy run at the end,

45:30.397 --> 45:32.732
and I was like, "Oh, he was just
holding that in,

45:32.774 --> 45:35.610
like, till the end."
I just could really picture

45:35.652 --> 45:38.530
listening to your records
in the car.

45:38.571 --> 45:41.616
And then I turn around, and
you were just like shuffling,

45:41.658 --> 45:43.201
and you were like --
Getting it.

45:43.243 --> 45:45.078
You were getting it.
And I was just like --

45:45.120 --> 45:47.414
[ Cheers and applause ]
Yeah.

45:47.455 --> 45:48.707
Oh.

45:48.748 --> 45:50.125
Oh, my God.
What?!

45:50.166 --> 45:51.334
Yes, Chello!

45:51.376 --> 45:53.753
That's all I got, though.
I'm sorry.

45:53.795 --> 45:56.381
I am willing to just
get on my knees and beg.

45:56.423 --> 45:57.966
Oh, wow.
'Cause I know

45:58.008 --> 45:59.509
John's gonna try
to get the last word in.

45:59.551 --> 46:02.345
Right, right.
I see a lot of potential in you.

46:03.346 --> 46:04.556
Ooh.

46:04.597 --> 46:06.558
You know what's crazy
on this show?

46:06.599 --> 46:09.144
Because we can't see,
we have these fantasies

46:09.185 --> 46:11.104
of what does this person
look like, right?

46:11.146 --> 46:14.315
And for me, you actually
look like your voice,

46:14.357 --> 46:17.235
because you're so original,
your sound in your voice and

46:17.277 --> 46:18.778
kind of quirky and different.
Quirky.

46:18.820 --> 46:20.822
About it. And I didn't
get to see the dancing,

46:20.864 --> 46:22.532
but I'm very much...
Chello: You missed out.

46:22.574 --> 46:24.826
...looking forward to that.
Thank you so much.

46:24.868 --> 46:26.369
Chello!
What's up?

46:26.411 --> 46:29.330
I just loved
watching you perform.

46:29.372 --> 46:32.250
The word that came to my mind
most was joy.

46:32.292 --> 46:34.210
Yeah.
Like, it felt like you truly

46:34.252 --> 46:35.670
enjoyed being onstage,

46:35.712 --> 46:37.797
and you wanted to bring joy
to other people.

46:37.839 --> 46:40.800
Aww.
I love that song. And your voice
is so different and interesting,

46:40.842 --> 46:43.678
and I wanted to see how
you would cover any other song.

46:43.720 --> 46:45.847
Totally.
What do you like
to sing most of the time?

46:45.889 --> 46:49.768
I kind of just sing what
I listen to, like Jon Bellion.

46:49.809 --> 46:51.519
I love Jon Bellion!

46:51.561 --> 46:53.521

Me, too! Yeah.

46:53.563 --> 46:55.815
I've written with him a lot.
That's incredible.

46:55.857 --> 46:57.275
Do you perform live?

46:57.317 --> 46:59.194
Most of my live
performing experience

46:59.235 --> 47:00.653
has actually just been
from the church.

47:00.695 --> 47:02.530
I grew up singing and playing
in church, too,

47:02.572 --> 47:04.616
and I think the fact
that you get to bring joy

47:04.657 --> 47:07.619
and energy to this room
of people. And, you know,

47:07.660 --> 47:09.371
people go to church,
they want to hear the word.

47:09.412 --> 47:11.623
But the music
is such a key part.

47:11.664 --> 47:14.459
Yeah. And --
And, Chello, I, um --

47:14.501 --> 47:17.921
I-I-I would be
so excited to be your coach.

to get the last word in.

47:19.964 --> 47:21.966
Of course she is.

47:22.008 --> 47:24.511
It makes so much sense that
you're a fan of Jon Bellion,

47:24.552 --> 47:27.639
because what I see in you,

47:27.681 --> 47:30.141
I see in so many
of my favorite artists.

47:30.183 --> 47:31.768
Like, you're somebody
that I just want to,

and perform with you, you know?

as your coach?

Oh, I'm such a fan.

48:12.308 --> 48:16.604
I love Chello.
He is such a sneaky assassin.

artistic soul.

I knew he couldn't beat her.
John: Camila is new,

48:23.570 --> 48:25.655
but she's proven
to be very formidable.

48:25.697 --> 48:29.451

Why'd you pick Camila
and not John?

There was just something
about Camila's, like,

passion to work with me
that I was really attracted to.

as his coach.

My name's Sadie Bass,
I'm 25 years old,

55:58.942 --> 56:01.861

in Nashville, Tennessee.

56:01.903 --> 56:05.115
Growing up, I loved singing,
and I loved music,

56:05.156 --> 56:06.700
but I've just always
had stage fright.

56:06.741 --> 56:08.785
So not a lot of people
knew that I sang,

56:08.827 --> 56:10.912
and I always just kind of sang
for my family

56:10.954 --> 56:13.123
or in the car or the shower.

56:13.164 --> 56:14.791
And I've always been
a writer, too.

56:14.833 --> 56:17.335
I've kept a diary
and a little song book,

56:17.377 --> 56:21.631
but I think "The Voice" is gonna
be a really huge test

56:21.673 --> 56:23.299
to see if I really
have what it takes

56:23.341 --> 56:26.970
and if I can do something
like this for a living.

56:27.012 --> 56:29.222
This is like the scariest.

56:29.264 --> 56:31.641
Don't be scared.
You'll get a chair.

"The Voice" is gonna
be a game changer

56:34.019 --> 56:35.687
when it comes
to my stage fright.

56:35.729 --> 56:37.355
I still just have
that sinking feeling.

56:37.397 --> 56:40.025
I think I've always been, like,
not confident in my singing.

56:40.066 --> 56:41.401
And I think going on "The Voice"

56:41.443 --> 56:43.987
and really learning
and getting that feedback

56:44.029 --> 56:46.614
is gonna make
a huge difference going forward.

57:01.004 --> 57:03.256
And country music's
all about storytelling.

57:03.298 --> 57:06.092
I really do relate to this song
because, you know, this girl,

she's just doing her own thing.

57:07.427 --> 57:09.179

to figure it out.

she's just so much stronger.

A lot of this will have to do
with your coach,

'cause sometimes,
you just need that person

being that I was late
to the game,

but now almost seven years with
Blake, have learned so much.

1:01:45.830 --> 1:01:49.376

because I am a songwriter,

is all about the story.

Sadie: I thought for sure
I was gonna pick Blake,

1:02:48.935 --> 1:02:51.855

and tells me how she can help me

1:02:51.896 --> 1:02:53.356
with my voice, my confidence.

1:02:53.398 --> 1:02:55.859
And it was just a no-brainer,
so I went with Gwen.

1:02:55.900 --> 1:02:57.485
Why did you make her think
I hate Michigan?

1:02:57.527 --> 1:03:01.281
I didn't. All I said was
my dad's from Michigan.

Growing up, me and my brother
both went by C.J.

1:03:21.134 --> 1:03:25.221
But people would get confused,
so they started calling him HEj,

1:03:25.263 --> 1:03:27.766
and they would call me SHEj.

1:03:27.807 --> 1:03:29.601

it just kind of hit me one day.

1:03:29.642 --> 1:03:32.312

when they sing, you feel them.

on my phone that I listen to,

Mm-hmm.
Some of the notes
you were hitting,

1:06:24.651 --> 1:06:26.903
especially at the very end,
I was like, whoa.

1:06:26.945 --> 1:06:30.907

this range and this ability

some control and some execution.

and I don't want you to lose

1:06:43.336 --> 1:06:45.255
is some of the timing
that you do.

1:06:45.296 --> 1:06:49.718
It was so unpredictable
and something that probably,

it comes to you naturally
that other people can't do.

don't get discouraged,

this person on your team.

It's like kind of
singer-songwriter folk,

I'm telling you,

he could be on the radio.

in the span of this song?

It took me that long to hit

to her say all this stuff.

1:20:38.463 --> 1:20:41.299
Yes, you do!
You have a -- You have a chance
to choose Gwen.

1:20:41.341 --> 1:20:44.761
But just know that I would love
for you to be on Team Legend.

1:20:44.803 --> 1:20:47.889
Appreciate you.
Thank you.

1:20:47.931 --> 1:20:51.810
I could totally picture you
doing like, "Uh-huh, this my --"

1:20:51.851 --> 1:20:54.521
* All the girls,
stomp your feet like this, hey *

1:20:54.562 --> 1:20:56.022
* 'Cause I ain't
no hollaback girl *

1:20:56.064 --> 1:20:58.441
Yeah! See?!
[ Cheers and applause ]

1:20:58.483 --> 1:20:59.651
I knew it!

1:20:59.693 --> 1:21:01.277
[ Cheers and applause ]

1:21:01.319 --> 1:21:04.781
When you did the John Legend
song, that part of your voice --

1:21:04.823 --> 1:21:06.616
That was crazy.
Oh, it's so -- It's gorgeous.

1:21:06.658 --> 1:21:09.661
Then I was even more like, okay,
I got to get this guy on my team

1:21:09.703 --> 1:21:11.621
because this guy
could really make records.

1:21:11.663 --> 1:21:13.456
I appreciate it.
What's interesting about you

1:21:13.498 --> 1:21:15.542
is you already know
so much who you are.

1:21:15.583 --> 1:21:17.669
That's right.
I would just like
to get in there and figure out

1:21:17.711 --> 1:21:20.296
how do we get people
to really know your personality,

1:21:20.338 --> 1:21:21.798
to really,
really get to your heart.

1:21:21.840 --> 1:21:24.050
Yes, ma'am.
And John's amazing, but --

1:21:24.092 --> 1:21:26.970
Gwen's amazing.
You all are amazing.

1:21:27.012 --> 1:21:29.055
Okay. Pick me.

1:21:29.097 --> 1:21:30.348
Let's go.

1:21:30.390 --> 1:21:32.434
John's amazing.
Gwen's amazing.

1:21:32.475 --> 1:21:34.811
Blake is blocked.
[ Laughter ]

1:21:34.853 --> 1:21:35.854
It's a great day.

1:21:35.895 --> 1:21:37.480
It's a great day
in America.

1:21:37.522 --> 1:21:39.107
When you sang your song,

1:21:39.149 --> 1:21:40.734
I was like, mm, for some reason,
I don't feel like

1:21:40.775 --> 1:21:44.487
it's the right fit
for what I'm looking for.

1:21:44.529 --> 1:21:46.448
But then when you sang
"All of Me,"

1:21:46.489 --> 1:21:48.950
now I'm having
extreme regret.

1:21:48.992 --> 1:21:50.535
And then you even sang
"Hollaback Girl."

1:21:50.577 --> 1:21:53.580
And I was like, damn,
even that sounds good.

1:21:53.621 --> 1:21:55.415
John, also, I was really
starstruck by you

1:21:55.457 --> 1:21:56.958
when you sang "All of Me."
Oh, stop it.

1:21:57.000 --> 1:21:59.878
I was like,
"Oh, my gosh! John! Stop!"

1:21:59.919 --> 1:22:01.338
You gave me goosebumps,
brother.

1:22:01.379 --> 1:22:02.839
I was so honored
to hear you sing it.

1:22:02.881 --> 1:22:03.798
Bromance.

1:22:03.840 --> 1:22:05.508
John Legend
can kiss my ass.

1:22:05.550 --> 1:22:07.802
Oh, my goodness.
[ Laughing ] Oh, my God.

1:22:07.844 --> 1:22:10.096
You did have a great moment
there with John singing,

1:22:10.138 --> 1:22:11.639
and it was very special.

1:22:11.681 --> 1:22:13.933
But what would really have them
talking tomorrow morning

1:22:13.975 --> 1:22:17.812
on the "Today" show would be
if, after that moment happened,

1:22:17.854 --> 1:22:21.691
then you chose Gwen Stefani
to be your coach.
Yes! So very strategic.

1:22:21.733 --> 1:22:23.693
They would be like,
"Oh, my gosh.

1:22:23.735 --> 1:22:25.528
I can't believe he did that."
Don't encourage him!

1:22:25.570 --> 1:22:27.697
Don't encourage him, people!
You're Machiavellian.

1:22:27.739 --> 1:22:29.532
You're a smart man,
Blake Shelton.

1:22:29.574 --> 1:22:31.576
He knows who he's
going home with tonight,

1:22:31.618 --> 1:22:33.828
and it ain't John Legend.

1:22:33.870 --> 1:22:36.206
[ Laughter ]

1:22:36.247 --> 1:22:39.000
Peyton, who do you pick

1:22:39.042 --> 1:22:40.877
as your coach?

1:22:40.919 --> 1:22:42.087
[ Sighs ]

1:22:42.128 --> 1:22:43.421
Come on! Team Legend!

1:22:43.463 --> 1:22:45.882
[ Audience shouting ]

1:22:45.924 --> 1:22:48.051
Don't forget about
the "Today" show!

1:22:48.093 --> 1:22:52.389
**

1:22:52.430 --> 1:22:55.058
I think I got to go with...

1:22:55.100 --> 1:22:58.019
**

1:22:58.061 --> 1:22:59.020
...my boy John Legend.

1:22:59.062 --> 1:23:01.398
* I can't sit and hope *
Yeah!

1:23:01.439 --> 1:23:05.068
* I can't just sit and pray *
John: You know, I had
a rough day, but I'm back.

1:23:05.110 --> 1:23:06.611
Peyton's definitely
one of the best singers

1:23:06.653 --> 1:23:08.071
in the competition so far.

1:23:08.113 --> 1:23:10.407
He sings from his soul
and there's this honesty,

1:23:10.448 --> 1:23:13.201
and there's this
authenticity to him.

1:23:13.243 --> 1:23:14.619
I'm glad I blocked Blake,

1:23:14.661 --> 1:23:16.621
because I probably
would have lost him to him.

1:23:16.663 --> 1:23:18.540
I got you a jacket.

1:23:18.581 --> 1:23:20.125
Gwen: I'm really bummed
I didn't get Peyton.

1:23:20.166 --> 1:23:22.460
I kind of thought he was
gonna be a hollaback girl,

1:23:22.502 --> 1:23:25.171
but, mm, guess he wasn't
a hollaback girl.

1:23:25.213 --> 1:23:27.507
What happened?

1:23:27.549 --> 1:23:29.426
What happened here?

1:23:29.467 --> 1:23:30.927
John Legend is now sitting

1:23:30.969 --> 1:23:35.306
in the old Adam Levine
and Kelly Clarkson seat.

1:23:35.348 --> 1:23:36.975
And so I fully expect him

1:23:37.017 --> 1:23:40.520
to take on the personality
of that seat,

1:23:40.562 --> 1:23:43.690
which is being
very unprofessional, rude,

1:23:43.732 --> 1:23:45.942
mean, come over,
rub it in my face --

1:23:45.984 --> 1:23:47.944
you know, all the stuff
that happens

1:23:47.986 --> 1:23:50.488
when somebody sits in that seat,
and they direct their anger

1:23:50.530 --> 1:23:52.282
towards me.
Why does that happen?

1:23:52.323 --> 1:23:55.201
I just like seeing Blake
getting blocked. It's fun.

1:23:55.243 --> 1:23:57.954
I'mma call you Blocked now.
[ Laughter ]

1:23:57.996 --> 1:23:59.956
It's not that funny.
It's not that funny.

1:23:59.998 --> 1:24:03.084
I'm working on it.
It's a joke in development.

1:24:03.126 --> 1:24:04.210
[ Laughter ]
