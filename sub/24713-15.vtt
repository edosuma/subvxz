10:11.235 --> 10:12.236
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

10:12.236 --> 10:14.780
ROGER.

10:14.780 --> 10:17.700
WE'LL BE IN TOUCH
IF WE NEED ANYTHING ELSE.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.833
THIS IS THE WOMAN DON
WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR WITH.

10:25.833 --> 10:27.585
THE ONE YOU CAUGHT HIM WITH?

10:27.585 --> 10:30.838
AND THE HUSBAND'S WHO CAME TO
THE SQUAD TO TELL YOU ABOUT IT.

10:30.838 --> 10:32.757
THAT KIND OF PUTS ME
IN THE MIDDLE.

10:32.757 --> 10:35.301
WELL, THAT'S NOTHING I'D
TELL THE BOSS FOR NOW.

10:35.301 --> 10:36.510
THANKS. GOOD.

10:36.510 --> 10:37.970
WE'VE GOT TO FIND
THE HUSBAND.

10:37.970 --> 10:39.055
AND DON.

10:39.055 --> 10:40.306
YEAH.

10:40.306 --> 10:42.767
YOU HEARD WHAT HAPPENED
IN THE BAR THAT NIGHT.

10:42.767 --> 10:45.853
HE'S BEEN ACTING CRAZY,
BUT HE WOULDN'T DO
SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

10:45.853 --> 10:48.189
YEAH, NO. NO WAY.

11:01.577 --> 11:04.246
Man:<i> JUST TELL THE COPS</i>
<i>THE PLACE WAS BOMBED</i>

11:04.246 --> 11:06.707
<i>BY SAVE THE BABIES</i>
<i>IN THE NAME OF JESUS</i>

11:06.707 --> 11:09.502
<i>AND PRAISE JESUS</i>
<i>AND WE'RE GONNA DO IT AGAIN.</i>

11:09.502 --> 11:10.836
Woman:<i> SIR?</i>

11:10.836 --> 11:12.797
CALL CAME IN AROUND 8:00 A.M.

11:12.797 --> 11:14.965
CRIME SCENE COULDN'T GET
PRINTS OFF THE PHONE.

11:14.965 --> 11:17.468
THREE HOURS AFTER THE FACT,
HE'S STILL PRETTY AMPED UP.

11:17.468 --> 11:19.220
THAT DOESN'T JIVE
WITH THE PRO-LIFERS

11:19.220 --> 11:21.389
WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO.
THEY GOT A STEADIER HAND.

11:21.389 --> 11:23.057
ANYTHING FROM INTELLIGENCE
ON SAVE THE BABIES?

11:23.057 --> 11:24.725
THEY NEVER HEARD OF THEM.

11:24.725 --> 11:27.186
FIRE CHIEF SAID THE BOMB WAS
A STANDARD MOLOTOV COCKTAIL --

11:27.186 --> 11:28.479
BEER BOTTLES, LIGHTER FLUID.

11:28.479 --> 11:30.064
STUFF YOU GET AT A BODEGA.

11:30.064 --> 11:32.108
FIGURE SOMEONE WHO'D
PLANNED IT WOULD'VE
USED GASOLINE.

11:32.108 --> 11:33.901
AND WOULD'VE
MADE A COHERENT STATEMENT.

11:33.901 --> 11:35.569
SO IF WE'RE LOOKING FOR
AN AMATEUR,

11:35.569 --> 11:38.531
I GUESS WE OWE MR. SOLDIERS
OF GOD AN APOLOGY.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.032
I'LL SEND FLOWERS.

11:41.409 --> 11:43.911
SORRY TO INTERRUPT.
THERE'S A WOMAN HERE TO SEE YOU.

11:43.911 --> 11:45.079
SHE WAS ALL COVERED UP

11:45.079 --> 11:47.164
AND ASKED THAT I GET HER
SOMEWHERE PRIVATE.

11:47.164 --> 11:48.999
SHE'S IN INTERVIEW THREE.
WHAT'S HER NAME?

11:48.999 --> 11:52.211
SHE WOULDN'T SAY -- JUST
THAT SHE WAS AT THE CLINIC
THIS MORNING

11:52.211 --> 11:54.755
AND SHE NEEDED TO SPEAK
TO YOU.

12:01.220 --> 12:03.764
Clark:
YOU'RE THE NURSE -- MARTIN.

12:03.764 --> 12:05.015
JENNIFER MARTIN -- YEAH.

12:05.015 --> 12:07.268
I-I WANTED TO KNOW
HOW THE CASE WAS GOING.

12:07.268 --> 12:08.519
SLOW.

12:08.519 --> 12:10.980
HAVE YOU TALKED TO
ANY OF THE PRO-LIFE GROUPS?

12:10.980 --> 12:13.399
A FEW. NONE OF THEM
ARE LOOKING GOOD FOR IT.
SOME THINGS DON'T ADD UP.

12:13.399 --> 12:14.483
LIKE WHAT?

12:14.483 --> 12:16.736
MS. MARTIN, DO YOU HAVE
SOMETHING FOR US?

12:16.736 --> 12:18.404
PEOPLE DON'T SNEAK IN
DRESSED LIKE SPIES

12:18.404 --> 12:20.614
JUST TO SEE
HOW A CASE IS GOING.

12:20.614 --> 12:22.032
MAYBE I'M A LITTLE PARANOID

12:22.032 --> 12:23.868
BECAUSE MY OFFICE
WAS BOMBED TODAY.
OKAY.

12:23.868 --> 12:25.828
I MEAN, HAS THAT
EVER HAPPENED TO YOU?

12:25.828 --> 12:27.788
IS SOMETHING BOTHERING
YOU, MS. MARTIN?

12:27.788 --> 12:30.416
I'D LIKE TO KNOW
HOW MANY TIMES<i> YOU</i>
HAVE BEEN TAUNTED

12:30.416 --> 12:32.543
ON YOUR WAY OUT OF WORK,
AND THEN FOLLOWED HOME,

12:32.543 --> 12:35.337
AND THEN WALKED OUT
YOUR FRONT DOOR THE NEXT DAY

12:35.337 --> 12:38.466
TO FIND A MINIATURE GRAVEYARD
WITH LITTLE WHITE CROSSES.
MS. MARTIN...

12:38.466 --> 12:41.093
I HAVE BEEN WITH THIS CLINIC
FOR FIVE YEARS,

12:41.093 --> 12:43.596
AND WE HAVE PUT UP
WITH A LOT OF TERRORISM,

12:43.596 --> 12:45.014
AND SO HAVE OUR PATIENTS,

12:45.014 --> 12:48.142
SO I UNDERSTAND AND AGREE
WITH DR. WACHTEL'S POSITION

12:48.142 --> 12:50.686
ON PATIENT PRIVILEGE
AND CONFIDENTIALITY,

12:50.686 --> 12:53.898
BUT I-I JUST...

12:53.898 --> 12:56.150
PETE, OUR SECURITY GUARD
WHO DIED,

12:56.150 --> 12:57.860
HE WAS A SWEET MAN.

12:57.860 --> 13:00.029
AND I HAVE TWO KIDS, MYSELF.

13:00.029 --> 13:02.531
AND I AM SICK OF FEARING
FOR MY LIFE.

13:02.531 --> 13:04.700
YOU SHOULD
TAKE A SEAT HERE.

13:13.834 --> 13:16.462
AM I RIGHT THINKING
THAT YOU WANT TO HELP,

13:16.462 --> 13:19.256
BUT YOU THINK DOING THAT
MIGHT BETRAY DR. WACHTEL?

13:19.256 --> 13:21.634
I BELIEVE IN
WHAT SHE STANDS FOR.

13:21.634 --> 13:24.929
BUT THAT'S NOT GOING TO HELP
FIND WHO DID THIS.

13:24.929 --> 13:27.056
WHATEVER YOU GIVE US,
WE'LL SAY WE GOT ANONYMOUSLY.

13:27.056 --> 13:29.058
NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW.

13:29.058 --> 13:30.392
I'LL KNOW.

13:42.905 --> 13:44.865
THIS IS A PATIENT LIST?

13:44.865 --> 13:47.868
FROM THE PAST YEAR.

13:47.868 --> 13:50.162
THE ASTERISKS ARE PEOPLE
YOU SHOULD TALK TO FIRST.

13:50.162 --> 13:51.372
AS SUSPECTS?

13:51.372 --> 13:54.708
THEY HAD COMPLICATIONS,
LODGED COMPLAINTS.

13:54.708 --> 13:56.919
SOME OF THEM MADE THREATS.

13:56.919 --> 13:59.630
IT'S ALL SPELLED OUT
ON THE SHEET IN BACK.

13:59.630 --> 14:03.133
I COULD LOSE MY JOB FOR THIS
OR BE SUED BY DR. WACHTEL

14:03.133 --> 14:06.136
OR E-EVERY PERSON
ON THAT LIST OR BOTH,

14:06.136 --> 14:08.931
SO...SAFEGUARD THAT.

14:08.931 --> 14:11.267
DON'T LET ANYONE KNOW
WHERE IT CAME FROM.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.435
WE NEVER SAW YOU.

14:13.435 --> 14:15.312
AND PLEASE --
DON'T CALL ME A SPY AGAIN.

14:15.312 --> 14:16.564
BAD CHOICE OF WORDS.

14:18.315 --> 14:20.776
WELL, ELLEN, IF YOU
COULD PAGE DON AGAIN,
I'D APPRECIATE IT.

14:20.776 --> 14:21.944
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

14:21.944 --> 14:23.779
TELL HIM IT ISN'T
ABOUT THE DIVORCE.

14:23.779 --> 14:25.865
I JUST NEED TO SPEAK
WITH HIM RIGHT AWAY.

14:25.865 --> 14:26.991
THANK YOU.

14:26.991 --> 14:28.325
ANY LUCK FINDING DON?

14:28.325 --> 14:30.661
HE'S NOT ANSWERING AT HOME,
HIS CELL, OR PAGER,

14:30.661 --> 14:32.371
WHICH COULD MEAN
HE'S DUCKING ME

14:32.371 --> 14:34.498
BECAUSE HE ASSUMES
IT'S ABOUT THE DIVORCE.

14:34.498 --> 14:36.584
WHAT ABOUT HIS SECRETARY?
HAS SHE SEEN HIM?

14:36.584 --> 14:38.377
SHE SAID HE HAD
AN EARLY APPOINTMENT,

14:38.377 --> 14:41.297
AND THEN HE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
TAKING A STATEMENT AT THE TOMBS,

14:41.297 --> 14:42.464
SO KEEP PAGING HIM.

14:42.464 --> 14:43.799
CHIEF OF DEEDS CALLED.

14:43.799 --> 14:45.968
A CAR REGISTERED
TO A ROGER SIMMONS WAS FOUND

14:45.968 --> 14:47.636
WITH A D.O.A. INSIDE.

14:47.636 --> 14:49.096
WHAT'S THE SIGNIFICANCE?

14:49.096 --> 14:51.015
UH, THAT'S OUR D.O.A.'s
HUSBAND.

14:51.015 --> 14:52.099
ANY I.D. ON THE BODY?

14:52.099 --> 14:54.643
ALL THEY SAID WAS D.O.A.
9-4 IN BROOKLYN.

14:54.643 --> 14:55.811
CHECK IT OUT.

14:57.062 --> 14:59.231
HEY, BOSS, UH,
BALLISTICS CAME BACK

14:59.231 --> 15:01.400
ON THE GUN FOUND
IN THAT MUSTANG.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.110
APPARENTLY THERE'S
A BODY ON IT.

15:03.110 --> 15:05.404
A JANE DOE DUMP JOB
FROM FIVE YEARS AGO.

15:05.404 --> 15:08.157
BUT LUKE'S UNCLE OWNED THE CAR
WHEN THE DUMP JOB WAS FOUND?

15:08.157 --> 15:10.242
LUKE'S UNCLE BOUGHT THE CAR
AT A POLICE AUCTION

15:10.242 --> 15:12.161
SEVEN MONTHS LATER,
SO HE'S IN THE CLEAR.

15:12.161 --> 15:13.996
BUT AT THE TIME
THE DUMP JOB CAME IN,

15:13.996 --> 15:17.166
DMV SAID THE CAR WAS OWNED
BY A WOMAN NAMED PAULA THOMAS,

15:17.166 --> 15:20.419
SAME AGE AND DESCRIPTION
AS THE D.O.A.

15:20.419 --> 15:22.212
MISSING PERSONS GOT ANYTHING
ON PAULA THOMAS?

15:22.212 --> 15:23.797
THERE'S NO REPORT IN NEW YORK
OR JERSEY,

15:23.797 --> 15:25.549
AND CHANCES ARE
THERE ISN'T ONE.

15:25.549 --> 15:28.636
THE CAR WAS REGISTERED IN NEW
YORK, LAST ADDRESS WAS NEW YORK,

15:28.636 --> 15:30.679
AND WE CAME UP
WITH A FATHER IN QUEENS.

15:30.679 --> 15:32.264
HE SHOULD BE HERE SOON.

15:32.264 --> 15:34.183
THIS HIM?

15:34.183 --> 15:35.935
HI. I'M NOEL THOMAS.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.562
I'M HERE TO SEE
DETECTIVES MEDAVOY OR JONES.

15:38.562 --> 15:41.565
RIGHT HERE, MR. THOMAS.
GREG MEDAVOY, BALDWIN JONES.

15:41.565 --> 15:42.900
HI. HOW ARE YOU?

15:42.900 --> 15:44.401
COME IN AND HAVE A SEAT.

15:44.401 --> 15:45.945
THANK YOU, SIR.

15:45.945 --> 15:49.740
SORRY TO DRAG YOU AWAY
FROM YOUR STORE,

15:49.740 --> 15:51.951
BUT WE NEED TO ASK YOU
SOME QUESTIONS

15:51.951 --> 15:53.494
ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER PAULA.

15:53.494 --> 15:55.245
PAULA? IS SHE
INVOLVED IN SOMETHING?

15:55.245 --> 15:57.081
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE
TRYING TO DETERMINE.

15:57.081 --> 15:58.749
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW HER?

15:58.749 --> 16:01.418
FIVE... ALMOST 5 1/2 YEARS.

16:01.418 --> 16:02.544
WHY SO LONG?

16:02.544 --> 16:05.130
WE HAD A FALLING-OUT.
SHE WAS A DIFFICULT KID.

16:05.130 --> 16:07.132
AND YOU'VE HAD
NO CONTACT AT ALL?

16:07.132 --> 16:09.885
TWO YEARS AFTER SHE LEFT,
I CALLED HER APARTMENT,

16:09.885 --> 16:11.553
BUT SHE WASN'T THERE ANYMORE,

16:11.553 --> 16:14.807
AND LAST YEAR WE HIRED A P.I.,
BUT NOTHING.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.559
YOU SAID SHE
WAS DIFFICULT -- HOW?

16:17.559 --> 16:18.811
DRUGS. STEALING.

16:18.811 --> 16:21.730
SHE WAS WITH THIS GUY
WE DIDN'T LIKE -- A REAL BUM.

16:21.730 --> 16:23.565
HE GOT HER HOOKED.

16:23.565 --> 16:25.234
WAS HE EVER VIOLENT
WITH HER?

16:25.234 --> 16:26.819
HE'D SMACK HER AROUND.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.737
WAS THERE A SPECIFIC REASON
YOU NEVER FILED

16:28.737 --> 16:30.114
A MISSING PERSON'S
REPORT ON HER?

16:30.114 --> 16:33.033
SHE'S ALWAYS THREATENING TO GO
TO CALIFORNIA WITH THE BUM,

16:33.033 --> 16:35.202
SO WE JUST FIGURED
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED.

16:35.202 --> 16:37.371
HAVE YOU TALKED TO PAULA?
IS SHE ALL RIGHT?

16:37.371 --> 16:39.456
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO DETERMINE HERE?

16:39.456 --> 16:41.709
DID YOUR DAUGHTER OWN
AN OLD-MODEL MUSTANG?

16:41.709 --> 16:44.628
YEAH. I GAVE IT TO HER
WHEN SHE TURNED 17.

16:44.628 --> 16:47.464
WELL, THE PRESENT OWNER
FOUND A GUN UNDER THE SEAT.

16:47.464 --> 16:51.218
SHE WOULDN'T HAVE A GUN.
SHE'S A DECENT KID DEEP DOWN.

16:51.218 --> 16:53.762
MR. THOMAS, WE'D LIKE YOU
TO LOOK AT SOME PHOTOGRAPHS,

16:53.762 --> 16:55.889
BUT I WANT YOU
TO PREPARE YOURSELF,

16:55.889 --> 16:57.933
BECAUSE THEY'RE PHOTOS
OF A DEAD WOMAN.

16:57.933 --> 16:58.934
IS IT PAULA?

16:58.934 --> 17:00.936
Baldwin: WE DON'T KNOW.

17:00.936 --> 17:02.896
OH, GOD!

17:06.775 --> 17:10.362
WE'D LIKE TO TALK TO
THE BOYFRIEND YOU MENTIONED.

17:10.362 --> 17:12.239
SONNY WOOD.

17:13.699 --> 17:16.535
TAKE YOUR TIME, SIR.

17:16.535 --> 17:19.913
HAVE A SEAT, MRS. ROOKARD.

17:19.913 --> 17:21.498
OKAY.

17:24.460 --> 17:26.336
NOW ARE YOU
GOING TO TELL ME

17:26.336 --> 17:28.505
ABOUT THE CASE
YOU WANT TO DISCUSS?

17:28.505 --> 17:31.050
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN
TO THE ENCOUNTER WOMEN'S CLINIC?

17:31.050 --> 17:32.051
WHY?

17:32.051 --> 17:34.303
THE CLINIC WAS FIREBOMBED
THIS MORNING.

17:34.303 --> 17:36.847
WE'RE HOPING YOU CAN HELP US
FIND WHO DID IT.

17:36.847 --> 17:39.641
HOW COULD I POSSIBLY HELP YOU?
HOW DID YOU FIND ME?

17:39.641 --> 17:41.435
LET'S CONCENTRATE ON SEEING
IF YOU CAN HELP.

17:41.435 --> 17:43.979
HOW WOULD YOU CATEGORIZE
YOUR EXPERIENCE AT THE CLINIC?

17:43.979 --> 17:45.647
GOOD? BAD?

17:45.647 --> 17:48.108
THIS IS PRIVATE BUSINESS.
IT'S DOCTOR-PATIENT PRIVILEGED.

17:48.108 --> 17:50.986
WE UNDERSTAND, AND WE'RE NOT
TRYING TO PRY INTO YOUR LIFE.

17:50.986 --> 17:52.696
WE JUST WANT TO SOLVE
THE FIREBOMBING.

17:52.696 --> 17:54.114
WERE YOU LESS THAN SATISFIED

17:54.114 --> 17:56.325
WITH THE WAY YOU
WERE TREATED AT THE CLINIC?

17:56.325 --> 17:58.368
I GUESS.
COULD YOU TELL US WHY?

17:58.368 --> 18:00.537
AM I GOING TO HAVE TO TESTIFY
IN SOME KIND OF TRIAL?

18:00.537 --> 18:03.082
MA'AM, YOU'RE JUMPING
1,000 MILES AHEAD.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.375
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN

18:05.375 --> 18:07.211
IF MY FAMILY FOUND OUT
I WENT FOR ABORTION COUNSELING?

18:07.211 --> 18:09.463
THEY WOULD NEVER
SPEAK TO ME AGAIN.

18:09.463 --> 18:11.173
MY FATHER IS A DEACON
IN OUR CHURCH.

18:11.173 --> 18:13.717
ANSWER US HONESTLY,
AND WE WON'T LET IT
GET TO THAT.

18:13.717 --> 18:15.511
ANSWER HONESTLY ABOUT WHAT?

18:15.511 --> 18:18.097
YOU MADE AND CANCELED
SEVEN APPOINTMENTS

18:18.097 --> 18:20.099
TO HAVE AN ABORTION,
IS THAT CORRECT?

18:20.099 --> 18:21.683
I COULDN'T DECIDE
WHAT TO DO.

18:21.683 --> 18:24.103
DID THE CLINIC TAKE
ANY ACTION?

18:24.103 --> 18:25.854
THEY REFUSED TO SEE ME AGAIN
BECAUSE THEY SAID

18:25.854 --> 18:27.606
MY PREGNANCY
HAD GOTTEN TOO FAR ALONG.

18:27.606 --> 18:30.901
DID YOU LEAVE IT ALONE
OR CONTACT THEM?

18:30.901 --> 18:32.569
OH, MY GOD. DO YOU --

18:32.569 --> 18:35.447
DO YOU THINK<i> I </i>FIREBOMBED
THE CLINIC?

18:35.447 --> 18:37.032
DID YOU CONTACT THE CLINIC?

18:37.032 --> 18:39.368
I WAS VERY ANGRY AND --
AND CONFUSED.

18:39.368 --> 18:41.870
IT WAS THE WORST TIME
OF MY ENTIRE LIFE,

18:41.870 --> 18:45.332
BUT WRITING THEM A FEW LETTERS
DOESN'T MAKE ME AN ARSONIST.

18:45.332 --> 18:48.752
<i>TEN </i>LETTERS, TWO OF THEM SAYING
YOU WISH THEY'D BURN DOWN.

18:48.752 --> 18:51.046
WELL, I WISH
I HADN'T WRITTEN THEM.

18:51.046 --> 18:53.257
BUT I AM GLAD
THEY TURNED ME AWAY,

18:53.257 --> 18:55.467
BECAUSE MY SON IS A GIFT
FROM GOD.

18:55.467 --> 18:58.512
ARE YOU INVOLVED WITH
ANY RIGHT-TO-LIFE GROUPS,

18:58.512 --> 19:00.764
MAYBE ONE CALLED
SAVE THE BABIES?

19:00.764 --> 19:01.974
NO!

19:01.974 --> 19:04.268
WHERE WERE YOU THIS MORNING

39:44.090 --> 39:45.383
ANY SENSE OF WHY?

39:45.383 --> 39:47.385
NOW HOW DOES THIS FIT
IN THE CASE?

39:47.385 --> 39:50.054
SOME OF HIS COWORKERS SUGGESTED
THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN SOME

39:50.054 --> 39:52.515
IMPROPRIETY BEHIND THE SCENES
UNRELATED TO THE HOMICIDE.

39:52.515 --> 39:54.058
IMPROPRIETY HERE?

39:54.058 --> 39:55.935
DON HARRISON EVER VISIT
THE SQUAD?

39:55.935 --> 39:58.938
A FEW TIMES TO SEE HOW RITA
WAS WORKING OUT.

39:58.938 --> 40:02.400
WAS THERE EVER AN ALTERCATION IN
THE SQUAD BETWEEN DON AND RITA?

40:02.400 --> 40:04.610
HIS COWORKERS
SAID HE MENTIONED ONE.

40:04.610 --> 40:07.279
IT WAS HARDLY AN ALTERCATION,
AND IT WAS OVER PRETTY QUICK.

40:07.279 --> 40:09.615
WHAT WAS THE NATURE
OF THE INCIDENT?

40:09.615 --> 40:12.368
THAT'S BETWEEN RITA AND DON.
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT, CAPTAIN?

40:12.368 --> 40:14.662
HARRISON WAS CONVINCED
HIS WIFE WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR

40:14.662 --> 40:16.163
WITH A DETECTIVE
IN THE SQUAD.

40:16.163 --> 40:17.331
DO YOU KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT IT?

40:17.331 --> 40:18.916
I SAW NO EVIDENCE
OF THAT.

40:18.916 --> 40:21.252
WOULD YOU BE SURPRISED
TO HEAR DON SUSPECTED

40:21.252 --> 40:23.671
YOU WERE HAVING AN AFFAIR
WITH DETECTIVE ORTIZ?

40:23.671 --> 40:25.297
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

40:25.297 --> 40:27.716
IF YOU ARE, IT'S SOMETHING YOU
WANT TO GET IN FRONT OF.

40:27.716 --> 40:29.552
MY RELATIONSHIP
WITH RITA ORTIZ

40:29.552 --> 40:32.012
HAS NEVER BEEN
MORE THAN SUPERVISORY.

40:32.012 --> 40:33.848
ANYONE WHO SAYS
DIFFERENT IS LYING.

40:33.848 --> 40:35.391
THAT WOULD BE
DON HARRISON'S FRIENDS.

40:35.391 --> 40:36.767
THEY CAN KISS MY ASS!

40:36.767 --> 40:38.602
TONY, I'M JUST ASKING
A QUESTION.

40:38.602 --> 40:40.729
AND I'M ANSWERING.
I RUN A CLEAN SQUAD.

40:40.729 --> 40:43.524
IF YOU WANT TO WASTE YOUR TIME
TRYING TO PROVE OTHERWISE,

40:43.524 --> 40:44.775
BE MY GUEST.

40:44.775 --> 40:46.569
NO POINT IN THAT.
IS THERE?

40:51.407 --> 40:52.825
PLEASURE MEETING YOU.

41:11.010 --> 41:13.137
Andy: HOW'S SHE DOING?

41:13.137 --> 41:15.014
UH...
HANGING IN.

41:16.557 --> 41:20.603
LISTEN, IF YOU DON'T MIND, I'M
GONNA BAIL ON THE PLANETARIUM.

41:20.603 --> 41:22.646
I THOUGHT I'D GET HER HOME,
MAKE SURE SHE'S OKAY.

41:22.646 --> 41:24.940
YEAH.
I'LL EXPLAIN TO THEO.

41:24.940 --> 41:27.485
OKAY. TELL HIM WE'RE STILL ON
FOR THE ZOO TOMORROW.

41:33.324 --> 41:36.202
DO YOU HAVE ANY PHYSICAL
EVIDENCE TYING SONNY WOOD

41:36.202 --> 41:37.620
TO KILLING PAULA THOMAS?

41:37.620 --> 41:38.996
JUST THE GUN.

41:38.996 --> 41:40.414
WHICH, ASIDE
FROM HIS CONFESSION,

41:40.414 --> 41:41.749
WE CAN'T PROVE
HE EVER TOUCHED.

41:41.749 --> 41:43.751
THIS IS TRUE.

41:43.751 --> 41:46.253
I HOPE YOU HAVE A GOOD
RIGHTS WAIVER, SIGNED AND DATED.

41:46.253 --> 41:47.421
WE DID.

41:47.421 --> 41:50.382
YOU'RE GONNA NEED IT.
AND A VIDEO STATEMENT TOO.

41:50.382 --> 41:52.551
YEAH. I-I'LL LEAVE
THAT TO BALDWIN.

41:52.551 --> 41:55.054
YOU SHOULD'VE SEEN HIM
IN THE ROOM, COUNSELOR.

41:55.054 --> 41:58.390
HE -- HE HAD THE PERP THANKING
HIM FOR LETTING HIM CONFESS.

41:58.390 --> 41:59.725
QUITE AN INTERVIEW.

41:59.725 --> 42:02.102
I'LL GET A VIDEO TEAM UP HERE
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

42:06.482 --> 42:08.817
SOMETHING ELSE
YOU WANTED TO SAY?

42:08.817 --> 42:11.195
I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU
THE SAME THING.

42:11.195 --> 42:13.322
MAYBE WE SHOULD COOL IT
FOR A WHILE.

42:28.587 --> 42:30.047
I'LL BE RIGHT OUT.

42:35.052 --> 42:36.804
SHE ALL RIGHT?

42:36.804 --> 42:38.013
I'M TAKING HER TO DINNER.

42:38.013 --> 42:40.391
AND IF ANYONE'S
AVAILABLE TO JOIN,

42:40.391 --> 42:43.185
I GOT A HUNCH SHE MIGHT
WANT TO BE AROUND FRIENDS.

42:43.185 --> 42:45.271
YEAH, SURE.

42:45.271 --> 42:46.313
I'M IN.

42:46.313 --> 42:48.148
Jones: ME TOO.
I GOT THEO.

42:48.148 --> 42:50.317
DETECTIVE,
I COULD GET THEO.

42:52.778 --> 42:54.738
WE WERE JUST
TALKING AND, UH,

42:54.738 --> 42:58.158
WOULD YOU MIND IF THE REST
OF US JOINED YOU AND CONNIE?

42:58.158 --> 42:59.827
NO, NOT AT ALL.

42:59.827 --> 43:01.787
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
LIKE THE COMPANY.

43:01.787 --> 43:03.622
I, UH -- I APPRECIATE IT,

43:03.622 --> 43:06.458
BUT IF YOU HAVE
SOMETHING ELSE TO DO...

43:06.458 --> 43:08.127
IT'S WHAT WE WANT TO DO.

43:08.127 --> 43:11.005
THE SQUAD STICKS TOGETHER.
WE'RE A TEAM.

43:11.005 --> 43:12.256
YOU'RE ON THE TEAM.

43:28.272 --> 43:29.982
[ EXHALES ]

43:34.194 --> 43:35.738
COME ON.
