01:25.085 --> 01:26.085
Woo!

01:29.289 --> 01:30.222
Okay.

01:31.357 --> 01:33.258
My glasses are foggy.

01:33.626 --> 01:34.793
Did I fuck your
glasses off?

01:52.745 --> 01:54.847
You know, the problem
with having sex at lunch

01:54.849 --> 01:57.282
is there's no time to eat.

01:57.284 --> 01:59.151
So now I have to have my
lunch on my coffee break

01:59.153 --> 01:59.151
and coffee at dinner.

01:59.153 --> 02:02.488
You have fucked
my entire day.

02:03.456 --> 02:04.723
Wanna do it again?

02:04.725 --> 02:04.723
No.

02:04.725 --> 02:07.659
Because then I would have to
have coffee as tomorrow's

02:07.661 --> 02:09.294
breakfast, but you know me.

02:09.295 --> 02:10.294
I don't complain.

02:10.297 --> 02:11.430
No, I have to work.

02:11.432 --> 02:13.532
Dedicated professional
that you are.

02:17.470 --> 02:18.770
What's this?

02:19.572 --> 02:21.473
That's just a doodle.

02:21.741 --> 02:23.709
Wow, looks good.

02:24.544 --> 02:27.246
Oh! It's you.

02:28.381 --> 02:31.316
You know, you really
don't need those, right?

02:31.318 --> 02:32.818
You're not that
kind of girl.

02:33.286 --> 02:34.786
What does that mean?

02:36.156 --> 02:37.222
Nothing.

02:37.224 --> 02:38.290
It was meant as
a compliment.

02:38.292 --> 02:41.827
I happen to love
your small...

02:41.829 --> 02:44.963
Small-ish breasts.

02:44.965 --> 02:47.266
They're nonthreatening.
They're like my friends.

02:47.268 --> 02:48.767
You know what I'm saying.
This girl...

02:48.769 --> 02:52.638
Would go out with some slick,
Hollywood player dude.

02:52.640 --> 02:55.607
This girl would never
have sex with me.

02:57.243 --> 02:59.778
And now you're not going
to either, are you?

03:00.847 --> 03:01.880
Shit.

03:07.554 --> 03:09.922
I'm gonna stop talking
now and leave.

03:09.924 --> 03:11.423
Yeah, that would be good.

03:11.425 --> 03:12.558
Mhm.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.860
Okay.

03:17.297 --> 03:18.897
Excuse me.

03:18.899 --> 03:20.666
Hello?

03:24.737 --> 03:27.272
I'm sorry, I couldn't
find the reception.

03:27.274 --> 03:29.341
Uh, there is no reception.

03:29.343 --> 03:29.341
Can I help you?

03:29.343 --> 03:33.845
I just wanted to know
how they were made.

03:33.847 --> 03:34.947
The dolls.

03:34.949 --> 03:36.615
Uh, I'm sorry.

03:36.617 --> 03:38.684
We don't give tours
of the factory.

03:38.686 --> 03:40.385
Oh.

03:41.521 --> 03:43.355
Excuse me.

03:50.230 --> 03:53.432
I was thinking of
placing a custom order.

03:53.434 --> 03:56.535
Something very specific.

03:56.537 --> 03:57.970
I can pay.

03:59.305 --> 04:01.573
Please, I live across the
border and it's been a

04:01.575 --> 04:03.475
very long drive.

04:03.910 --> 04:05.344
Okay.

04:06.479 --> 04:07.746
Okay.

04:10.016 --> 04:11.550
They're all custom made.

04:11.552 --> 04:13.752
We have a variety
of body types.

04:13.754 --> 04:16.288
Something for all tastes.

04:16.290 --> 04:20.358
You just supply the height
and measurements, eye color,

04:20.361 --> 04:26.598
hair, skin tone with fair,
tanned, Asian, African.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.468
You can get them to
replicate celebrities.

04:29.470 --> 04:33.905
Scarlett Johansson and Beyonce
are very popular right now.

04:33.907 --> 04:36.341
Here's one of our
latest models.

04:36.343 --> 04:38.744
Uh, the talkies
as we call them.

04:38.746 --> 04:41.413
Emma rocks my rocket.

04:42.315 --> 04:43.815
You idiot.

04:58.898 --> 05:00.799
May I touch it?

05:07.473 --> 05:10.642
I'm not interested
in a celebrity doll.

05:11.411 --> 05:15.447
I want you to
make someone real.

05:18.651 --> 05:24.389
My wife, she had the
most perfect body.

05:25.425 --> 05:30.729
Slender, 5'8" with
very large breasts.

05:31.497 --> 05:33.732
36dd.

05:36.836 --> 05:38.704
They haunt me.

05:40.840 --> 05:44.076
It was those breasts
that I couldn't forget.

05:44.078 --> 05:47.546
Those massive breasts.

05:48.147 --> 05:50.515
I lost her two years ago.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.451
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:52.453 --> 05:54.586
To her personal trainer,
Italian, fifteen years

05:54.588 --> 05:56.088
younger than me.

05:57.023 --> 06:00.025
Can you make these even larger
than what she originally had?

06:00.027 --> 06:01.593
Yeah, sure.

06:01.595 --> 06:03.128
Perfect.

06:04.497 --> 06:07.466
And you can make her look
exactly like my wife?

06:07.468 --> 06:08.567
We can make it...

06:08.569 --> 06:11.903
Her look identical.

06:11.905 --> 06:13.405
But better.

06:44.504 --> 06:45.637
Um...

06:45.639 --> 06:46.838
Uh, what's her name?

06:46.840 --> 06:47.572
Michelle.

06:47.574 --> 06:47.572
Michelle.

06:47.574 --> 06:47.572
Michelle, you're
not on your mark.

06:47.574 --> 06:50.876
Okay, just a
little to the left.

06:54.514 --> 06:55.580
Uh, no.

06:55.582 --> 06:56.581
No, no, no, no, no.

06:56.583 --> 06:57.783
Don't smile, okay?

06:57.785 --> 06:58.884
No expression.

06:58.886 --> 07:00.786
I don't wanna
photograph Michelle.

07:00.788 --> 07:02.621
I wanna see who
you really are.

07:06.592 --> 07:07.993
Don't, don't
struggle with it.

07:07.995 --> 07:10.695
You know, just let
Michelle fly away because

07:10.697 --> 07:12.731
I still see her in there.

07:14.967 --> 07:15.767
Yes!

07:15.769 --> 07:16.735
There, there!

07:16.737 --> 07:17.602
She's gone!

07:17.604 --> 07:19.471
You are all women.

07:19.473 --> 07:21.440
And you are no women.

07:21.442 --> 07:25.577
You are everything
and you are nothing.

07:25.579 --> 07:26.912
More nothing.

07:26.914 --> 07:28.713
More nothing!

08:25.171 --> 08:26.938
You're not that kind of girl.

08:27.173 --> 08:29.040
He's right you know.

08:30.309 --> 08:35.080
Maybe I'm not this type
of girl, but you're

08:35.082 --> 08:38.015
definitely not
this type of guy.

09:32.338 --> 09:34.272
So who is he?

09:34.274 --> 09:36.841
I mean, your sketches are
amazing, but what are you

09:36.843 --> 09:39.110
trying to do
with this guy?

09:39.112 --> 09:44.249
This guy is my dream man.

09:44.251 --> 09:50.989
He's perfect, he's hot
and stylish, suave.

09:50.991 --> 09:52.123
He's my size.

09:52.125 --> 09:53.592
Okay, I get it.

09:53.594 --> 09:53.592
This is about me, right?

09:53.594 --> 09:56.061
This is because I called
your tits my friends.

09:56.063 --> 09:57.662
This has nothing
to do with you.

09:57.664 --> 09:58.930
Oh yeah?

10:00.099 --> 10:01.232
Mhm.

10:02.835 --> 10:05.704
Well, your perfect
guy is totally boring.

10:05.706 --> 10:07.205
He has no personality.

10:07.207 --> 10:10.942
He's like this tiny,
little, generic suave guy.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.310
No, no.

10:12.312 --> 10:15.013
He's an artist.

10:15.015 --> 10:17.882
He's smart and
he has an accent.

10:17.884 --> 10:20.385
-What, French?
-No.

10:20.387 --> 10:22.387
-Spanish.
-Oh.

10:22.389 --> 10:26.758
I'm sorry, I couldn't hear it i
guess because it's a drawing.

10:26.760 --> 10:29.361
You are being hilariously
defensive about this.

10:29.363 --> 10:31.630
Hey, you can fantasize all
you want, that's fine.

10:31.632 --> 10:33.098
But I'd just like to
bring up one point.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.867
That guy would
never be with you.

10:35.869 --> 10:35.867
Have you thought of that?

10:35.869 --> 10:40.271
That guy would be with
someone who looks like that.

10:47.380 --> 10:48.880
Okay, that's fine.

10:49.782 --> 10:49.781
You have your fun.

10:49.783 --> 10:52.884
I am gonna deliver one of
these perfect people to a

10:52.886 --> 10:54.853
fat pervert in Hamilton.

11:20.379 --> 11:23.948
Careful. It's easy
to get hypnotized.

11:24.950 --> 11:27.686
I was lost there
for a second.

11:28.754 --> 11:32.457
They all look identical,
but really they're not.

11:32.459 --> 11:34.092
They're like ghosts.

11:34.094 --> 11:37.429
Individual spirits
floating through the void.

11:37.930 --> 11:40.265
I find it soothing.

11:40.267 --> 11:41.900
Yeah.

11:42.435 --> 11:44.235
I come here every day.

11:44.237 --> 11:45.870
So do I.

11:50.710 --> 11:54.179
Do you think they know
they live in a prison?

11:54.181 --> 11:55.113
We'll never know.

11:55.115 --> 11:57.248
They don't speak.

11:57.250 --> 12:00.885
They live in silence.

12:02.388 --> 12:05.356
Let us sculpt in
hopeless silence.

12:05.358 --> 12:08.126
All our dreams
of speaking.

12:08.894 --> 12:11.196
Fernando pessoa.

12:12.398 --> 12:13.765
Yes.

12:13.767 --> 12:15.233
That's beautiful.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.235
Are you a writer?

12:17.237 --> 12:17.235
I think so.

12:17.237 --> 12:21.206
I feel like the universe is
trying to tell me something.

12:23.976 --> 12:26.411
Well I think we drained
this aquarium of every

12:26.413 --> 12:27.912
possible metaphor.

12:27.914 --> 12:29.481
We should meet at the
planetarium next time.

12:30.450 --> 12:32.150
Yes.

12:32.152 --> 12:33.351
It was a real
pleasure, Michelle.

12:33.353 --> 12:33.351
Me too.

12:33.353 --> 12:35.820
Don't forget,
you have my card.

12:35.822 --> 12:36.888
Send me what you can.

12:36.890 --> 12:38.089
I will.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.858
Thank you, Norman.

12:40.559 --> 12:42.427
Who the fuck was that?

12:42.429 --> 12:43.828
A book publisher.

12:43.830 --> 12:45.930
And he wants to
read my material.

12:45.932 --> 12:47.799
Yeah, I'm sure he does.

13:10.122 --> 13:11.356
Perfect!

13:11.358 --> 13:12.357
Cut!

13:12.359 --> 13:14.425
That was incredible.

13:14.427 --> 13:15.393
That was incredible.

13:15.395 --> 13:16.327
Alright, people.

13:16.329 --> 13:17.495
Thank you, that's a wrap.

13:17.497 --> 13:20.031
Don't forget the
wrap party tonight.

13:20.033 --> 13:21.232
Thank you, man.

13:22.201 --> 13:23.835
-Thank you.
-Alright.

13:23.837 --> 13:25.103
Eddie!

13:25.105 --> 13:25.103
You're a genius!

13:25.105 --> 13:28.606
That brain of yours,
that beautiful brain.

13:28.608 --> 13:30.809
My brain is a turd
compared to yours.

13:30.811 --> 13:32.210
A turd on my
big bald head.

13:32.212 --> 13:34.179
Now, I'm gonna introduce
you to that woman yonder,

13:34.181 --> 13:35.313
but be careful.

13:35.315 --> 13:36.514
She's the new head
of the studio.

13:36.516 --> 13:37.582
She's a tough cookie.

13:37.584 --> 13:38.817
Marissa.

13:38.819 --> 13:38.817
The boy wonder.

13:38.819 --> 13:41.252
I hope you didn't
come here to fire me.

13:41.254 --> 13:42.387
Oh no, are you kidding me?

13:42.389 --> 13:43.521
I love your films.

13:43.523 --> 13:45.824
Switchblade and.

13:45.826 --> 13:46.925
-J-force.
-J-force.

13:46.927 --> 13:48.326
Yes. They're big,
you know?

13:48.328 --> 13:48.326
They're bold.

13:48.328 --> 13:51.396
The explosions
and car crashes.

13:51.398 --> 13:53.031
He puts so much
testosterone on this

13:53.033 --> 13:55.166
screen you can taste it.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.601
Almost.

13:56.603 --> 14:00.104
I mean, I don't know what
testosterone tastes like.

14:00.906 --> 14:02.407
Yeah, actually this film,
i wanna do something

14:02.409 --> 14:03.908
that's a little
bit more deep.

14:03.910 --> 14:06.244
You know, cause I'm
excited to show the world

14:06.246 --> 14:07.912
that I'm not
two-dimensional, you know?

14:07.914 --> 14:10.348
And listen, if you're excited,
we are really excited.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.350
And I heard that your
editor has been working

14:12.352 --> 14:14.319
around the clock so i
would really love to see

14:14.321 --> 14:15.920
an assembly Monday.

14:15.922 --> 14:18.122
It's just a general
assembly he has, you know,

14:18.124 --> 14:20.458
I have to go to the editing
room, work around it, you know?

14:20.460 --> 14:21.960
Right, got it.
Okay, Tuesday.

14:21.962 --> 14:23.328
Can you, um, book us
a screening room?

14:23.330 --> 14:24.262
-No.
-Right away.

14:24.264 --> 14:25.864
-Thank you.
-No, no.

14:25.866 --> 14:28.032
Tuesday, I'm not gonna be
ready to show you anything

14:28.034 --> 14:28.032
on Tuesday, really.

14:28.034 --> 14:30.335
I mean, I wanna
show you my vision.

14:30.337 --> 14:30.335
Uh-huh.

14:30.337 --> 14:33.304
This film wants to
be transcendental.

14:33.306 --> 14:33.304
Good, good.

14:33.306 --> 14:37.609
Um, I'm still gonna need to
see an assembly by Tuesday.

14:37.611 --> 14:40.311
Why not we do Tuesday,
but at the same time you

14:40.313 --> 14:43.081
agree to come with me
tonight to the wrap party.

14:43.083 --> 14:45.683
I don't really party with
below the line people and

14:45.685 --> 14:48.519
I kinda get roped into
this fundraiser for kids

14:48.521 --> 14:50.021
-with cleft palates.
-Oh.

14:50.023 --> 14:51.689
So I gotta head back.

14:51.691 --> 14:53.124
-Watch out, watch out!
-Oh!

14:56.229 --> 14:57.061
Are you okay?

14:57.063 --> 14:58.663
I think so.

15:00.165 --> 15:01.532
Your glasses.

15:02.301 --> 15:04.002
Okay.

15:06.306 --> 15:07.238
You okay?

15:07.240 --> 15:09.040
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

15:09.241 --> 15:13.144
Yeah, I think I can find
time for a quick drink.

15:13.146 --> 15:14.479
Yeah.

15:14.481 --> 15:16.247
Bye.

15:35.167 --> 15:36.601
Nice seeing you again.

15:39.471 --> 15:41.105
Emma?

15:47.746 --> 15:50.381
So these are sorta what
you're looking for?

16:00.292 --> 16:02.160
We can totally do this.

16:02.695 --> 16:07.031
After surgery, you will
look exactly like this.

16:08.500 --> 16:10.435
You looking at serrano?

16:14.974 --> 16:16.741
Had that done years ago.

16:16.743 --> 16:18.343
Won my first
rhino with that.

16:18.345 --> 16:18.343
Rhino?

16:18.345 --> 16:22.113
2005 rhinoplasty awards.

16:22.115 --> 16:25.383
I had it sculpted nice and
big just to remind myself

16:25.385 --> 16:26.751
of my humble beginnings.

16:31.490 --> 16:33.124
Anyway, back to you.

16:33.126 --> 16:33.124
Come on.

16:33.126 --> 16:36.661
Let's have a look at these
little guys over here.

16:41.100 --> 16:45.436
So, if you wanna look like
one of your drawings,

16:45.438 --> 16:49.440
I would go with this one.

16:49.442 --> 16:50.541
Right here.

16:51.477 --> 16:53.144
How much?

16:54.747 --> 16:56.314
Wow.

16:56.316 --> 16:58.549
-That's a lot of money.
-Mhm.

16:58.551 --> 17:00.318
I've been saving up
to buy a condo.

17:00.320 --> 17:02.653
Well just remember, you
can't show off your condo

17:02.655 --> 17:04.222
at the beach.

17:08.292 --> 17:10.028
Hey, guys.
Carl stromway here.

17:10.030 --> 17:12.296
I just wanna introduce a
special tool that'll help

17:12.298 --> 17:14.598
all of you who wanna show
off that sexy body at the

17:14.601 --> 17:14.598
beach this summer.

17:14.601 --> 17:18.536
It's the premium Carl
stromway dumbbell.

17:32.317 --> 17:34.852
Here we go. We're gonna
start with a shrug.

17:34.854 --> 17:37.055
And then we're gonna
do the zombie.

17:37.057 --> 17:38.689
And then you're
gonna do a curl.

17:38.691 --> 17:39.624
There we go...

17:41.727 --> 17:42.727
Hey, baby.

17:42.729 --> 17:42.727
Hey.

17:42.729 --> 17:45.430
I got us something
for dinner.

17:45.432 --> 17:46.330
Oh, awesome.

18:01.780 --> 18:03.281
Who was that?

18:03.283 --> 18:08.653
Um, remember that book
publisher from the aquarium?

18:08.655 --> 18:11.589
He read a couple of
chapters from my book.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.558
He really likes them.

18:13.560 --> 18:16.461
And he wants to read
the whole thing.

18:16.463 --> 18:17.595
But there is no book.

18:17.597 --> 18:20.731
I know, but i
can write it.

18:20.733 --> 18:23.601
Can you even spell
one word in English?

18:26.572 --> 18:28.239
Oh, come on, Michelle.

18:28.241 --> 18:29.607
Come on.

18:29.609 --> 18:30.475
Michelle, come on.

18:30.477 --> 18:30.475
Look at me, look at me.

18:30.477 --> 18:34.412
This guy, he's a dangling
a carrot in front of that

18:34.414 --> 18:35.646
cute little Brazilian
nose of yours.

18:35.648 --> 18:37.215
I mean, come
on, look at you!

18:37.217 --> 18:38.483
You're not a writer.

18:38.485 --> 18:42.720
You're a model.

18:45.591 --> 18:47.191
You're an asshole.

18:48.460 --> 18:49.760
-I'm an asshole?
-Yeah!

18:49.762 --> 18:51.596
Look at everything
i do for you.

18:51.598 --> 18:53.664
You got photoshoots
all next week.

18:53.666 --> 18:54.765
Oh, Jesus Christ.

18:54.767 --> 18:57.135
Michelle, you
are so nalve!

18:57.137 --> 19:00.605
This guy just wants a piece of
your ass like everybody else.

21:49.641 --> 21:50.808
Hi.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.677
Don't worry.
No problem.

22:01.586 --> 22:03.354
-You know where I landed?
-Hm.

22:03.356 --> 22:04.822
-In the racetrack.
-Hm!

22:04.824 --> 22:06.824
Yeah, on top of a horse.

22:06.826 --> 22:08.926
And you know, the
worst part of it?

22:08.928 --> 22:10.461
I won.

22:10.463 --> 22:10.461
You won the race?

22:10.463 --> 22:15.366
Yeah, and it ended with
the horse and I won.

22:20.472 --> 22:21.972
What's up?

22:21.974 --> 22:22.840
Right there.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.141
What's his name?

22:24.143 --> 22:26.110
No, I've never
heard of him.

22:26.112 --> 22:28.446
No, I don't need a
reference, but I...

22:28.448 --> 22:30.981
You know, I'm not paying
$300 for a dog groomer.

22:30.983 --> 22:32.750
I think that's
a little steep.

22:32.752 --> 22:33.951
Alright.

22:33.953 --> 22:34.919
Bye.

22:39.424 --> 22:40.691
Oh god.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.159
Oh god.

22:42.161 --> 22:43.627
Oh god.

22:47.499 --> 22:49.967
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

22:49.969 --> 22:52.837
That's why I need
another week.

22:53.472 --> 22:55.139
So I can work on
the film, you know?

22:55.141 --> 22:56.707
Go to the editing
room, you know?

22:56.709 --> 22:58.042
So I can show
you my vision.

22:58.044 --> 22:59.910
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

23:55.500 --> 23:58.068
You are nothing.

24:05.944 --> 24:06.811
Hello?

24:06.813 --> 24:06.811
Michelle?

24:06.813 --> 24:08.846
I've been calling
you for hours.

24:08.848 --> 24:09.680
Where are you?

24:09.682 --> 24:10.948
Um, writing.

24:10.950 --> 24:10.948
Are you drunk?

24:10.950 --> 24:13.484
Alright, I'm coming
to get you right now.

24:13.486 --> 24:14.452
Where are you?

24:14.454 --> 24:15.519
Why?

24:15.521 --> 24:17.087
You don't think
i can write?

24:17.089 --> 24:18.789
I'm coming to get
you right now.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.624
Where are you, Michelle?

24:20.626 --> 24:22.660
At um...

24:27.233 --> 24:28.566
Where the fuck is that?

24:30.702 --> 24:32.002
Michelle?

24:32.004 --> 24:33.270
Michelle!

25:20.853 --> 25:24.121
Sexiest sister in town.

25:25.790 --> 25:27.992
Ladies and gentlemen.

25:27.994 --> 25:34.231
Let me introduce you to the
brand new, the unstoppable...

25:34.233 --> 25:35.766
Emma.

25:37.702 --> 25:39.103
Juicy.

25:39.105 --> 25:44.241
E, double m, a, double d.

25:44.243 --> 25:49.346
E, double m, a, double d.

26:07.999 --> 26:10.000
Oh, Sophia.

26:37.862 --> 26:39.597
Oh yeah.

26:51.676 --> 26:54.378
Eddie, my boy, you know that
i love you. And why not?

26:54.380 --> 26:58.916
You're a genius, you shit gold,
and oscars are made of gold.

26:58.918 --> 27:01.685
But this film
is different.

27:01.687 --> 27:03.153
It's humane, you know?

27:03.155 --> 27:05.022
It's deep, it's ambiguous.

27:05.024 --> 27:05.923
Mm.

27:05.925 --> 27:06.991
It's about...

27:06.993 --> 27:09.059
You know, it's a poem.

27:09.061 --> 27:10.761
I shot it like
a fucking poem.

27:10.763 --> 27:11.996
It's art, of course.

27:11.998 --> 27:13.197
-It's on another plane.
-Yeah.

27:13.199 --> 27:14.865
It's slow.

27:14.867 --> 27:16.266
The way art is.

27:16.268 --> 27:18.035
Uh... nothing much happens.

27:18.037 --> 27:19.937
Again, that's
an art thing.

27:19.939 --> 27:21.205
And don't get me
wrong, I love it.

27:21.207 --> 27:23.941
It touches my soul and i
didn't think I had one.

27:23.943 --> 27:26.777
I'm just worried, not
worried, but concerned and

27:26.779 --> 27:29.046
this is coming from me who's
an insect compared to you.

27:29.048 --> 27:32.983
I'm worried that Marissa
might not really like it.

27:32.985 --> 27:34.118
-What?
-Excuse me.

27:34.120 --> 27:37.021
Are you Edward
Deacon, the director?

27:37.023 --> 27:38.455
Yeah, I'm the
author, yeah.

27:38.457 --> 27:40.924
Would you care to walk
us to the bathroom?

27:40.926 --> 27:41.925
You know.

27:42.427 --> 27:43.661
Yes, yes.

27:43.663 --> 27:46.330
Man, don't worry
about Marissa.

27:46.332 --> 27:47.931
I know how to handle her.

27:47.933 --> 27:49.233
I mean, that's what I do.

27:56.208 --> 27:57.708
Oh no!

27:57.710 --> 28:00.344
Okay, I've never
done this before.

28:13.858 --> 28:15.092
Wow.

28:18.229 --> 28:19.730
-Can I?
-Yeah!

28:21.733 --> 28:23.067
-Okay.
-Okay.

28:23.069 --> 28:24.068
-Uh!
-Uh!

28:24.070 --> 28:24.868
We're there.

28:36.915 --> 28:39.817
Sensitive to the
temperature in here.

28:46.892 --> 28:48.192
Okay!

28:49.995 --> 28:51.895
Well...

28:51.897 --> 28:54.131
Thank you so
much for that.

28:54.733 --> 28:57.234
The new breasts are um...

28:57.236 --> 28:59.103
They're really something.

29:03.408 --> 29:04.908
It's uh...

29:05.910 --> 29:08.245
It's a bit weird.

29:08.247 --> 29:11.949
It's me that feels
a little like...

29:11.951 --> 29:14.151
Like I'm making love
to one of the dolls.

29:14.153 --> 29:16.053
Um...

29:16.055 --> 29:18.789
Which you know,
people do that.

29:18.791 --> 29:20.557
Lots of people do that.

29:20.559 --> 29:22.459
It's good business
is booming.

29:22.461 --> 29:24.495
So...

29:24.497 --> 29:26.296
You know, go team.

29:26.298 --> 29:28.198
-Let's get back to it.
-Okay.

29:46.585 --> 29:47.985
-Hey! What are you looking at?
-What?

29:47.987 --> 29:51.522
I don't know what
you're talking about?

29:51.524 --> 29:52.823
Check this beauty out.

29:52.825 --> 29:54.391
Baby, baby, baby.

29:54.393 --> 29:55.993
I'm in love
with the twins.

30:16.014 --> 30:17.281
Hm.

30:18.249 --> 30:19.883
Mhm.

30:21.119 --> 30:23.187
-Mm.
-Uh...

30:25.156 --> 30:26.156
Hm.

30:26.891 --> 30:28.392
They're too big.

30:30.595 --> 30:33.263
What do you mean
they're too big?

30:33.265 --> 30:35.399
Uh... they're too
big for my body.

30:35.401 --> 30:41.038
They're exactly the size you
requested and they look great.

30:43.241 --> 30:48.912
Do you remember this?

30:48.914 --> 30:50.247
Yeah, but--

30:50.249 --> 30:53.917
you chose these and they
look really great, really.

30:53.919 --> 30:55.085
I don't think they do.

30:55.087 --> 30:56.553
You know what you need?

30:56.555 --> 30:58.055
Some perspective.

30:59.424 --> 31:01.859
Candy, would you
come in here please?

31:01.861 --> 31:04.061
It's very hard to accurately
assess your own body.

31:04.063 --> 31:06.897
You need just an
objective opinion.

31:07.966 --> 31:07.965
Yes?

31:07.967 --> 31:10.400
What do you think
of her breasts?

31:10.402 --> 31:11.668
I think they're great.

31:11.670 --> 31:13.136
See?

31:13.138 --> 31:15.372
They are great.

31:15.374 --> 31:16.940
I don't want them anymore.

31:16.942 --> 31:18.942
I think I made a
terrible mistake.

31:18.944 --> 31:20.444
Really what you need is
just to live with these

31:20.446 --> 31:21.578
breasts for a
little while.

31:21.580 --> 31:24.248
It's like getting
a new sofa.

31:24.250 --> 31:25.682
For a couple of weeks,
it's all about the sofa.

31:25.684 --> 31:27.618
It's all you can see. You
think it looks ridiculous.

31:27.620 --> 31:33.557
And then one day, someone comes
up and says, I love that sofa.

31:33.559 --> 31:35.259
So fucking hot.

31:35.261 --> 31:37.561
Next thing you know, you're
showing everyone your sofa.

31:37.563 --> 31:39.196
You're getting
laid constantly.

31:39.198 --> 31:41.698
I don't want
these on my body.

31:43.434 --> 31:45.369
-Let me raise the nipples.
-What?

31:45.371 --> 31:46.670
Nipple placement.
It's everything.

31:46.672 --> 31:48.071
Right now they're not
where you expect them.

31:48.073 --> 31:49.373
It's disorientating.
Went through the same

31:49.375 --> 31:49.373
thing with my own--

31:49.375 --> 31:51.475
these fucking
breasts are too big!

31:51.477 --> 31:52.976
We can take
them down a cup.

31:53.945 --> 31:55.345
I want my old ones back.

31:55.347 --> 31:57.481
No, you don't want that.

31:57.483 --> 31:58.315
Yes, I do.

31:58.317 --> 31:59.349
They were tiny.

31:59.351 --> 32:00.550
Oh!

32:00.552 --> 32:02.085
You're an asshole.

32:02.087 --> 32:04.421
I want these
implants removed.

32:04.423 --> 32:05.555
Okay.

32:10.094 --> 32:12.195
But I have to warn you.

32:12.197 --> 32:14.131
The procedure involves the
same amount of time and

32:14.133 --> 32:16.500
work so it actually costs
the same to remove that it

32:16.502 --> 32:17.668
does to implant.

32:17.670 --> 32:20.070
I don't have money left.

32:20.305 --> 32:22.339
Oh, I'm sorry.

32:22.341 --> 32:24.574
There's nothing i
can do about that.

33:00.478 --> 33:03.313
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

33:05.516 --> 33:08.418
Why do you have
to be so big?

33:12.123 --> 33:14.157
You think you're
so perfect.

33:15.293 --> 33:16.994
Well take this.

33:33.077 --> 33:34.277
Oh my god.

33:34.279 --> 33:35.245
Oh my god, oh my god.

33:35.247 --> 33:37.147
I'm sorry.
No, no, no!

33:37.149 --> 33:39.483
Oh! Oh!

33:39.485 --> 33:40.317
I love you, it's me.

33:40.319 --> 33:42.219
Ah, ah, ah!

34:04.208 --> 34:05.776
I mean, there's no
explanation, right?

34:05.778 --> 34:05.776
There's no explanation, I mean.

34:05.778 --> 34:09.379
It just went miniature
just like that.

34:09.380 --> 34:12.114
Without even warning.

34:12.117 --> 34:14.484
I should just kill
myself really.

34:16.286 --> 34:18.588
-Should I?
-I'm sorry.

34:18.590 --> 34:20.489
I can't perform miracles.

36:16.807 --> 36:18.842
And the winning
numbers are...

36:19.677 --> 36:21.411
05...

36:21.413 --> 36:22.946
09...

36:22.948 --> 36:24.314
10...

36:24.316 --> 36:25.649
19...

36:25.651 --> 36:26.850
25...

36:26.852 --> 36:28.652
43...

36:28.654 --> 36:29.953
47.

36:30.755 --> 36:31.688
I won!

36:31.690 --> 36:33.256
I won!

37:00.651 --> 37:01.952
So tell me, Emma.

37:01.954 --> 37:03.687
What seems to
be the problem?

37:04.789 --> 37:06.223
Well...

37:07.291 --> 37:10.560
The thing is, doctor.

38:02.880 --> 38:04.681
You gotta be kidding me?

38:07.451 --> 38:08.585
Hey, what's up?

38:12.990 --> 38:14.557
Have a good one.

39:02.106 --> 39:04.741
This shit is worth
a lot of money.

39:06.844 --> 39:10.046
We could split it
and I could do my...

39:13.150 --> 39:14.851
It's missing!

39:14.853 --> 39:15.685
It's not here!

39:15.687 --> 39:16.953
This is my last one.

39:16.955 --> 39:18.822
Doing my show now.

39:19.623 --> 39:21.091
Okay, I'm at the
mailbox right now.

39:21.093 --> 39:22.559
It's not there.

39:22.960 --> 39:24.828
You know how
bad this looks?

39:25.129 --> 39:27.130
Yeah, I got a piece,
but I really don't wanna

39:27.132 --> 39:28.164
have to kill nobody today.

39:30.568 --> 39:31.935
-Fuck!
-Nevermind, I just found it.

39:31.937 --> 39:33.670
Okay, I'm gonna
call you back.

39:38.509 --> 39:40.377
So that's what... three.

39:40.379 --> 39:40.377
Three?

39:40.379 --> 39:42.712
That's it, that's
all you have?

39:42.714 --> 39:44.848
I don't know that many
people who do coke.

39:44.850 --> 39:46.449
They don't need
to be coke heads.

39:46.451 --> 39:48.651
They just need to be open minded
people who like to party.

39:48.653 --> 39:50.520
Most of my friends
are depressed loners.

39:50.522 --> 39:51.888
I'm sorry.

39:54.024 --> 39:56.092
Sorry. Fuck me.

39:58.162 --> 39:59.796
We need to find a real
drug dealer and sell

39:59.798 --> 39:59.796
this stuff to him.

39:59.798 --> 40:02.565
And how are we gonna
find a real dealer?

40:02.567 --> 40:03.833
How the hell would I know?

42:47.698 --> 42:49.098
How the hell
would I know?

42:52.970 --> 42:54.304
I know a guy.

42:58.876 --> 43:00.977
When'd you get that?

43:00.979 --> 43:02.278
Oh, that?

43:02.280 --> 43:03.646
I've had it for years.

43:04.114 --> 43:06.616
-I never noticed it.
-Huh.

43:06.618 --> 43:08.284
Where'd you get it done?

43:08.286 --> 43:11.654
Uh, I got it done the first
time I went to prison.

43:12.357 --> 43:13.189
What?

43:13.191 --> 43:14.390
When did you...

43:14.392 --> 43:16.693
You never...

43:16.695 --> 43:18.094
I have more.

43:18.096 --> 43:19.395
What?

43:19.397 --> 43:20.897
When did you? What?

43:21.398 --> 43:21.397
Prison?

43:21.399 --> 43:23.967
Don't you worry
about a thing, okay?

43:23.969 --> 43:28.972
The point is I know the business
and the business knows me.

43:28.974 --> 43:30.907
The business knows you?

43:30.909 --> 43:32.609
Yeah, I got a
guy in buffalo.

43:32.611 --> 43:32.609
Buffalo?

43:32.611 --> 43:37.914
He mainly deals meth and
pcp, but he owes me.

43:37.916 --> 43:39.716
And what did you do?

43:39.718 --> 43:40.984
Don't ask.

43:42.019 --> 43:42.018
Hey.

43:42.020 --> 43:45.188
Didn't the mustache
freak drive in from--

43:45.190 --> 43:46.022
buffalo.

43:46.024 --> 43:48.091
-Yeah.
-Perfect.

43:48.093 --> 43:48.091
A gift from god.

43:48.093 --> 43:54.931
But isn't it dangerous to cross
the border with that stuff?

43:54.933 --> 43:59.302
Listen, if you really wanna deal
with these two problems...

43:59.304 --> 44:02.672
Where there's a
will, there's a way.

44:28.399 --> 44:29.298
Hello?

44:29.300 --> 44:30.299
Hi.

44:30.301 --> 44:31.968
Yeah, it's me, Eddie.

44:31.970 --> 44:32.935
Yeah.

44:32.937 --> 44:32.935
I'm sorry.

44:32.937 --> 44:32.935
I'm sorry about last time.

44:32.937 --> 44:37.373
I was tired, you know,
it was a long day.

44:38.208 --> 44:39.108
Ah!

44:39.110 --> 44:39.942
No, I'm just kidding.

44:39.944 --> 44:40.443
Come on.

44:40.445 --> 44:41.944
Welcome.

44:53.891 --> 44:55.324
Can we turn off the light?

44:56.727 --> 44:58.161
Do you grow after?

44:58.462 --> 44:59.929
Mhm.

44:59.931 --> 45:01.264
To this left?

45:01.266 --> 45:02.699
-The other.
-No.

45:02.701 --> 45:04.233
-No, no.
-Mm.

45:04.235 --> 45:06.269
May I help you?

45:06.271 --> 45:07.804
Um...

45:07.806 --> 45:09.505
-Can I help you?
-Yes, please.

45:09.507 --> 45:10.306
Maybe.

45:10.308 --> 45:11.307
I mean...

45:11.309 --> 45:12.141
Only if you want...

45:12.143 --> 45:13.443
No.

45:13.445 --> 45:14.444
To the right.

45:15.112 --> 45:16.879
Let's just begin
again, okay?

45:16.881 --> 45:18.214
Hold on one
second, hold on.

45:18.216 --> 45:19.415
I've got a plan.

45:21.251 --> 45:22.752
Just a little, just a...

45:22.754 --> 45:24.020
No, no.

45:27.091 --> 45:28.891
Okay, okay, now we're...

45:28.893 --> 45:30.059
Is it happening?

45:31.795 --> 45:33.930
You know what?
Um...

45:33.932 --> 45:36.032
You know, we can
always sleep, you know?

45:36.034 --> 45:37.967
Yeah, yeah, I think so.

45:37.969 --> 45:37.967
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

45:37.969 --> 45:37.967
-Goodnight.
- Yeah, you guys are tired?

45:37.969 --> 45:37.967
I'm really tired.

45:37.969 --> 45:41.471
-Ah, me too.
-Really tired.

45:41.473 --> 45:42.739
I'm sorry.

45:42.741 --> 45:43.873
-Okay.
-I'm...

45:43.875 --> 45:45.742
I'm really sorry.

45:45.744 --> 45:46.909
Hey, we can always be friends.

45:46.911 --> 45:48.311
-You know?
-Yeah.

45:48.313 --> 45:53.149
Sometimes friendship is more
valuable than you know.

45:53.151 --> 45:54.851
Shh!

47:33.617 --> 47:36.652
Let us sculpt
in hopeless silence.

47:36.654 --> 47:38.921
All our dreams
of speaking.

48:12.022 --> 48:15.057
Bear in mind, it's
still a very rough cut.

48:16.994 --> 48:19.495
Is there another reel?

48:19.497 --> 48:20.930
Another reel?

48:20.932 --> 48:22.899
Yeah because that's
not an ending, right?

48:22.901 --> 48:24.200
It stopped.

48:24.202 --> 48:25.534
Oh, that's the ending.

48:25.536 --> 48:27.336
Jumping off a cliff
is not an ending.

48:27.338 --> 48:28.304
It is the ending.

48:28.306 --> 48:29.572
That's the ending.

48:29.574 --> 48:31.240
She jumps out
of the cliff.

48:31.242 --> 48:35.011
You know, escaping from this
oppression of appearances.

48:35.013 --> 48:35.711
I mean...

48:35.713 --> 48:35.711
Or maybe not!

48:35.713 --> 48:39.248
You know, the audience is
left a little bit suspended.

48:39.250 --> 48:41.284
Yeah, it's the kind
of ending, it's...

48:41.286 --> 48:42.184
What's the word for it?

48:42.186 --> 48:42.184
Shit.

48:42.186 --> 48:45.087
-It's a shit ending.
-It's bullshit.

48:45.089 --> 48:45.087
To be specific.

48:45.089 --> 48:48.424
And what's with the couple
having sex on the beach?

48:48.426 --> 48:50.593
The couple is her parents.

48:50.595 --> 48:54.630
She's watching her parents
in her mind conceiving her.

48:59.503 --> 49:02.271
Her parents are having
sex in her mind?

49:02.273 --> 49:04.707
No, come on. Open yourself
to the film, okay?

49:04.709 --> 49:06.342
I mean, just give
yourself a little bit.

49:06.344 --> 49:06.342
You know, give it
a chance, I mean.

49:06.344 --> 49:10.613
The intention was never to a
Hollywood blockbuster at all.

49:10.615 --> 49:13.282
Yeah, I think
i noticed that.

49:13.284 --> 49:17.086
I mean... if this is the
first release, for me,

49:17.088 --> 49:18.688
as head of the studio,
this is gonna be my last.

49:18.690 --> 49:21.090
Well now. You know,
it's not all bad.

49:21.092 --> 49:23.059
-There's lots of...
-It's exotic, right?

49:23.061 --> 49:23.059
There's lesbians.

49:23.061 --> 49:25.628
That's always
hot and uh...

49:25.630 --> 49:27.296
Oh god.

49:27.298 --> 49:28.731
It's just limp.

49:28.733 --> 49:30.433
It's a little flaccid.

49:30.435 --> 49:32.268
Just a big
disappointment from you!

49:32.270 --> 49:34.103
I wanna see the balls
of Eddie Deacon!

49:34.105 --> 49:35.705
Of course you do.
Show her your balls.

49:35.707 --> 49:36.772
I'm gonna need
to be persuaded.

49:36.774 --> 49:38.040
Yes, alright!

49:38.042 --> 49:38.040
Persuade her.
Persuade her!

49:38.042 --> 49:40.209
Do you want me to
leave the room?

49:40.211 --> 49:41.277
No.

49:42.579 --> 49:44.180
What do you mean, no?

49:44.182 --> 49:46.449
No, no.

49:46.451 --> 49:47.783
I can't right now.

49:47.785 --> 49:49.051
No.

49:49.519 --> 49:51.354
Why not?

49:51.356 --> 49:53.422
I got my reasons, okay?

49:53.424 --> 49:56.625
And if I say no, I just
want you to respect that.

49:58.095 --> 49:59.395
Okay.

49:59.397 --> 50:00.663
I'll shelve it.

50:03.266 --> 50:04.533
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

50:04.535 --> 50:05.601
What he's saying is...

50:05.603 --> 50:05.601
He's being a coy.

50:05.603 --> 50:10.339
He's got lots of ideas,
big ballsy ideas,

50:10.341 --> 50:11.774
and he wanted to surprise
you with them.

50:11.776 --> 50:11.774
Right, Eddie? Come on,
give her a hint.

50:11.776 --> 50:16.779
Tell her about that ending we
were talking about it, you know?

50:16.781 --> 50:20.016
The reshoot in Brazil with the
explosion, the guy running.

50:20.018 --> 50:22.151
It's really so big,
i can't remember.

50:22.153 --> 50:23.619
It's confused in my head,
but you remember.

50:23.621 --> 50:25.054
You tell her.
You're so good with words.

50:25.056 --> 50:27.790
It gave me the shivers,
it was so ballsy.

50:27.792 --> 50:29.425
Eddie, is this true?

50:29.427 --> 50:31.727
I mean, we can always
shoot something, yeah.

50:31.729 --> 50:32.528
Okay!

50:32.530 --> 50:33.796
Good. That's excellent.

50:33.798 --> 50:35.431
Horowitz, make it happen.
Please, okay?

50:35.433 --> 50:37.166
And you, you big tease.

50:37.168 --> 50:38.701
I always knew you had
something up your sleeve.

50:38.703 --> 50:38.701
Alright, guys!

50:38.703 --> 50:41.237
I can't wait to see
what you guys do.

50:41.239 --> 50:42.605
Lots of kick ass shit!

50:42.607 --> 50:44.206
Hot shit, lesbian shit.

50:44.208 --> 50:45.474
Mhm. No lesbians.

50:45.476 --> 50:46.542
Niche demo.

50:46.544 --> 50:47.610
The lesbians are gone.

50:47.612 --> 50:48.811
They're gone.

50:49.579 --> 50:51.247
What the fuck was that?

50:59.423 --> 51:00.456
Come on!

51:06.129 --> 51:07.129
No.

51:09.099 --> 51:09.098
That's the one.

51:09.100 --> 51:12.234
It's gonna be delivered tomorrow
to that guy in buffalo.

51:12.236 --> 51:13.169
Alright.

51:15.439 --> 51:16.472
Perfect.

51:18.608 --> 51:20.476
Say hello to our mule.

51:27.151 --> 51:28.784
Lay her gently.

51:28.786 --> 51:30.453
Okay.

51:31.221 --> 51:32.455
Alright.

51:33.390 --> 51:34.523
What do you wanna do?

51:35.459 --> 51:35.458
What do you mean?

51:35.460 --> 51:39.395
You know, which orifice
do you wanna stuff?

51:39.397 --> 51:40.529
You got your
choice of three.

51:40.531 --> 51:42.765
What? I don't care.

51:44.134 --> 51:45.668
I'll do this one.

51:45.670 --> 51:47.570
Okay, and I'll
do this one.

51:59.516 --> 52:01.417
Why do I wanna
just dive right in?

52:02.219 --> 52:04.320
Maybe I should buy
her dinner first.

52:04.855 --> 52:06.889
Maybe we should focus.

52:27.577 --> 52:28.944
Tight squeeze.

52:28.946 --> 52:29.945
Got room for one more?

52:29.947 --> 52:31.514
Not down here.

52:31.516 --> 52:34.817
Maybe in the mouth if
i tilt the head back?

52:34.819 --> 52:36.452
Well...

52:36.454 --> 52:37.786
-Let's see.
-There we go.

52:37.788 --> 52:40.389
Baby, you're so big.

52:42.293 --> 52:43.492
That's it.

52:43.494 --> 52:45.594
She's stuffed.

52:47.297 --> 52:51.167
Are you at all
turned on right now?

52:51.535 --> 52:52.701
What?

52:53.336 --> 52:54.837
No.

52:54.839 --> 52:56.539
No, I don't know.
Um...

52:56.541 --> 52:59.608
Maybe it's because we're
doing something bad.

52:59.610 --> 53:00.943
Right.

53:01.711 --> 53:03.612
Just give me a
hand, okay?

53:06.951 --> 53:07.917
Wait, watch your step.

53:07.919 --> 53:08.851
-Oh!
-Okay.

53:08.853 --> 53:10.386
-Got it?
-Yup.

53:14.925 --> 53:16.292
Alright, I'll put her
on the truck tomorrow.

53:16.294 --> 53:17.693
Just another
regular delivery.

53:17.695 --> 53:17.693
You see?

53:17.695 --> 53:20.229
I told you I had
it under control.

53:21.565 --> 53:22.898
What's the
matter with you?

53:22.900 --> 53:25.000
We'll just go down there,
set up the camera, shoot

53:25.002 --> 53:26.235
some explosions, you know?

53:26.237 --> 53:26.235
Like the end of j-force.

53:26.237 --> 53:28.871
This film has nothing
to do with j-force.

53:28.873 --> 53:31.774
I got it, it's art, but excuse
me for stating the obvious.

53:31.776 --> 53:33.542
If you're gonna jam art
up the studio's ass,

53:33.544 --> 53:35.377
you gotta lube it
up a little.

53:35.379 --> 53:35.377
Why do I have to
tell you this?

53:35.379 --> 53:39.748
Why are you not handling this
situation in your usual fashion?

53:39.750 --> 53:41.383
Because I can't, okay?

53:41.385 --> 53:42.751
-I can't.
-Why not?

53:47.624 --> 53:49.258
It's my penis.

53:49.260 --> 53:51.994
-Go on.
-My penis is very small.

53:51.996 --> 53:51.994
It went smell.

53:51.996 --> 53:54.663
It was huge before
and now it's small.

53:54.665 --> 53:56.298
It disappeared almost.

53:56.300 --> 53:57.499
Right.

53:58.868 --> 54:00.536
That's a problem.

54:00.538 --> 54:03.606
Oh, come on. It happens
to everyone eventually.

54:03.608 --> 54:05.407
I mean, not me, I'm hung
like a horse, but look

54:05.409 --> 54:06.775
we're going to Brazil.

54:06.777 --> 54:08.477
They have hundreds of
ways of dealing with

54:08.479 --> 54:09.612
these kind of problems.

54:09.614 --> 54:11.380
I don't even wanna
think about it.

54:11.382 --> 54:12.881
In the meantime,
I'll cover for you.

54:12.883 --> 54:16.552
I'll shoot some inserts until
you feel yourself again, okay?

54:16.554 --> 54:18.587
I have some
ideas for scenes.

54:31.801 --> 54:33.002
Dale?

54:33.004 --> 54:35.271
You know, you're right.
This place is beautiful.

54:35.538 --> 54:37.339
What are you doing here?

54:37.341 --> 54:39.575
I came to see you.

54:39.577 --> 54:41.310
How did you find me?

54:41.611 --> 54:43.445
It wasn't hard, baby.

54:47.984 --> 54:50.052
Hey, you think i
can get a Capoeira?

54:51.288 --> 54:52.388
Sure.

54:54.491 --> 54:57.092
Michelle, I'm here to
bring you back home.

54:57.094 --> 54:58.761
I miss you.

54:58.763 --> 55:00.429
I want you back.

55:00.431 --> 55:01.964
I need to write my novel.

55:01.966 --> 55:03.499
Yeah, I know.

55:03.501 --> 55:05.834
And I still think it's crazy,
this whole book thing,

55:05.836 --> 55:09.004
but I already promised you
you could write it at home.

55:09.006 --> 55:11.106
I'll give you all
the space you need.

55:11.108 --> 55:12.675
I don't know.

55:14.945 --> 55:16.345
Hold on.

55:17.113 --> 55:18.547
Yeah, what is it?

55:24.354 --> 55:25.387
Yeah, I got it.

55:27.991 --> 55:29.358
Bad news.

55:29.759 --> 55:31.727
I just got word you're
in grave danger.

55:31.729 --> 55:34.129
Favela drug dealers are on
their way here to grab you.

55:34.131 --> 55:35.831
They're coming across
the beach as we speak.

55:35.833 --> 55:37.433
We gotta get out
of here right now.

55:37.435 --> 55:38.867
This makes no sense.

55:39.135 --> 55:40.336
There are no favelas here.

55:40.338 --> 55:41.570
These guys are dangerous.

55:41.572 --> 55:44.840
They're like
tropical terrorists.

55:44.842 --> 55:44.840
We gotta move.

55:44.842 --> 55:48.377
Now I'm not gonna let
anything bad happen to you.

55:48.379 --> 55:49.578
Give me your hand.

55:52.383 --> 55:53.549
And cut!

55:54.050 --> 55:57.786
Yes, that looked
fantastic.

55:57.788 --> 55:59.488
I don't know what
I'm doing here.

56:00.590 --> 56:02.424
This is what you're doing.

56:02.426 --> 56:03.759
You're shooting bullshit.

56:03.761 --> 56:04.827
You shoot the bullshit.

56:04.829 --> 56:06.729
We send the bullshit
to the studio.

56:06.731 --> 56:09.365
They eat the bullshit
and everybody's happy.

56:09.367 --> 56:11.467
Yeah, but this is not my
film anymore, you know?

56:11.469 --> 56:13.402
I feel like it's
slipping away from me.

56:13.803 --> 56:15.571
You're still worried about
your dick, aren't you?

56:15.573 --> 56:16.772
Of course I am!

56:16.774 --> 56:18.974
Friend, why don't you
take some time off?

56:18.976 --> 56:20.476
Go to the beach,
stare at the girls.

56:20.478 --> 56:23.078
Try to get some semblance
of an erection and leave

56:23.080 --> 56:23.078
the bullshit to me.

56:23.080 --> 56:27.416
You don't wanna be here anyway
for this product placement shit.

56:29.185 --> 56:29.184
Fiat.

56:29.186 --> 56:32.921
She's got a brand
new car, lucky her!

56:32.923 --> 56:34.022
No, you're kidding me.
Come on.

56:34.024 --> 56:35.891
They're covering
the entire reshoot.

56:35.893 --> 56:35.891
No.

56:35.893 --> 56:39.428
Like I said, I'd be
happy to shoot it.

56:41.998 --> 56:42.965
Morning!

56:49.639 --> 56:51.106
Has somebody been
moving stuff around?

56:51.108 --> 56:51.106
I don't know, why?

56:51.108 --> 56:54.109
Where is that box that was
supposed to be delivered

56:54.111 --> 56:54.109
to buffalo today?

56:54.111 --> 56:58.447
Oh, the guy who ordered it came
by this morning to pick it up.

56:58.449 --> 57:00.416
What do you mean?
When? Who was it?

57:00.418 --> 57:01.884
The weird guy
with the mustache.

57:01.886 --> 57:01.884
What does it matter?

57:01.886 --> 57:04.486
Saved us from shipping
it down there.

57:04.488 --> 57:05.988
And he paid for the order.

57:07.123 --> 57:08.457
We're fucked.

57:08.459 --> 57:09.658
We're totally fucked.

57:09.660 --> 57:12.828
Well, the only solution
is to get our girl back.

57:12.830 --> 57:13.762
Right?

57:13.764 --> 57:16.165
I mean, then we'll be fine.

57:16.167 --> 57:17.433
Right?

57:18.668 --> 57:20.702
-Right.
-Right.

57:29.012 --> 57:29.011
Give me your hand.

57:29.013 --> 57:31.680
Okay. Let me just
get my passport.

57:31.682 --> 57:32.614
Okay, but hurry.

57:32.616 --> 57:33.615
Time is of the essence!

57:33.617 --> 57:35.017
Okay, okay, okay.

57:52.535 --> 57:53.802
Pause!

57:54.270 --> 57:56.038
Maybe if we change her hair.

57:56.040 --> 57:57.573
Something.

58:34.110 --> 58:35.544
Dale!

58:35.546 --> 58:36.812
What the fuck
are you doing?

58:36.814 --> 58:38.847
Michelle, I told you.
We need to leave.

58:38.849 --> 58:38.847
No! No way!

58:38.849 --> 58:38.847
Michelle, there's
something wrong with you.

58:38.849 --> 58:43.185
You need to come home with me
so I can get you some help.

58:43.187 --> 58:45.587
There's nothing
wrong with me.

58:45.589 --> 58:46.788
I mean...

58:48.858 --> 58:50.092
-You need to come home with me.
-No!

58:50.094 --> 58:51.527
-You need to come back with me!
-No!

58:51.529 --> 58:53.862
-You do!
-No! No!

58:57.133 --> 58:58.734
This is for your own good.

59:00.670 --> 59:01.603
Dale.

59:01.605 --> 59:03.005
You need to let me go.

59:05.542 --> 59:06.775
I love you so much, baby.

59:06.777 --> 59:08.343
It's for your
own good, honey.

59:08.345 --> 59:09.845
I'm sorry, baby.

59:24.360 --> 59:26.128
And cut!

59:26.130 --> 59:28.363
Beautiful, beautiful!

59:29.365 --> 59:30.365
Hey.

59:30.367 --> 59:31.767
Hey, what's up?

59:31.769 --> 59:32.935
Eddie, my boy.

59:33.303 --> 59:34.703
Just in time.

59:34.705 --> 59:35.370
What are you doing?

59:35.372 --> 59:36.572
Oh!

59:36.574 --> 59:37.606
Helicopters?

59:37.608 --> 59:38.840
Yes, helicopters.

59:38.842 --> 59:39.808
Everyone loves
helicopters.

59:39.810 --> 59:40.709
It makes them happy.

59:40.711 --> 59:42.110
The studio loves
helicopters.

59:42.112 --> 59:43.879
Is this the new ending?

59:45.248 --> 59:47.249
Yes. It's the new
bang-up ending.

59:47.251 --> 59:49.284
You're shooting a new
ending behind my back.

59:49.286 --> 59:50.919
And you don't even know
what the fuck you're doing.

59:50.921 --> 59:52.187
I know, I'm stupid.

59:52.189 --> 59:53.889
I just thought with
my little pea brain,

59:53.891 --> 59:55.991
I thought why don't we shoot
an ending where something

59:55.993 --> 59:55.991
actually happens.

59:55.993 --> 59:58.327
You know, I know that's a
cliché, but you know,

59:58.329 --> 59:58.327
maybe a plot?

59:58.329 --> 01:00:01.997
Maybe Dale can come save
Michelle and people have

01:00:01.999 --> 01:00:01.997
something to cheer for.

01:00:01.999 --> 01:00:04.900
No, no, no!
Dale is the abductor.

01:00:04.902 --> 01:00:06.969
-He's abducting her.
-Abducting, saving.

01:00:06.971 --> 01:00:07.970
Why are you being
so negative?

01:00:07.972 --> 01:00:07.970
Because this is my movie.

01:00:07.972 --> 01:00:10.973
Our movie and the
studio's paying for it.

01:00:10.975 --> 01:00:12.374
No, the studio needs
my credit on it.

01:00:12.376 --> 01:00:16.044
-Oh, that's my chair.
-Oh, shut up!

01:00:16.046 --> 01:00:17.412
Do you want me to
call Marissa and you

01:00:17.414 --> 01:00:17.412
can talk to her about it?

01:00:17.414 --> 01:00:21.016
-Fine, yes, yes, fine!
-I will if I have to!

01:00:21.018 --> 01:00:22.384
Oh, look at that!

01:00:22.386 --> 01:00:23.385
What's the
matter with you?

01:00:23.387 --> 01:00:25.687
You used to love
helicopters.

01:00:25.689 --> 01:00:27.656
I'm saving your ass!

01:00:27.658 --> 01:00:30.659
You've already lost your dick,
you better save your ass!

01:00:32.662 --> 01:00:33.929
Not literally.

01:00:33.931 --> 01:00:36.331
We're just...
That's the way we talk.

01:00:38.167 --> 01:00:42.004
Okay, let's oil 'em up and uh,
move onto the next scene.

01:00:42.905 --> 01:00:44.439
Marissa.

01:00:44.441 --> 01:00:47.009
Yeah, we have
a problem here.

01:00:55.051 --> 01:00:56.785
Alright, let's do this.

01:01:00.890 --> 01:01:02.357
That trellis is
a fucking joke.

01:01:02.359 --> 01:01:03.392
-No.
-Fuck.

01:01:03.394 --> 01:01:03.392
Get down.
I can do it.

01:01:03.394 --> 01:01:05.460
-You can do this?
-Let me try.

01:01:05.462 --> 01:01:06.795
You can do this
on your own?

01:01:06.797 --> 01:01:07.829
I got this, I got this.

01:01:07.831 --> 01:01:07.829
I can do it.

01:01:07.831 --> 01:01:09.898
Alright, I'll stand guard.

01:01:09.900 --> 01:01:11.233
Okay, you promise?

01:01:11.235 --> 01:01:12.067
Yeah, are you
fucking nuts?

01:01:12.069 --> 01:01:13.168
I'm not going anywhere.

01:01:13.170 --> 01:01:14.469
-Come on.
-Okay.

01:01:17.006 --> 01:01:18.907
-Yup.
-Come on.

01:01:57.880 --> 01:01:58.847
Yes, darling.

01:01:58.849 --> 01:01:59.981
I took down that wallpaper.

01:01:59.983 --> 01:02:01.183
Need light.

01:02:01.185 --> 01:02:03.351
Well you weren't
here, were you?

01:02:24.774 --> 01:02:26.775
I have a surprise for
you, my darling.

01:02:28.978 --> 01:02:30.479
It is your favorite.

01:02:43.226 --> 01:02:46.328
Yes, of course I've
chilled the champagne.

01:02:49.031 --> 01:02:50.999
No, I did not
let it breathe.

01:02:51.001 --> 01:02:52.968
It's not like wine.

01:03:04.914 --> 01:03:06.281
Did you order a Capoeira?

01:03:06.283 --> 01:03:09.217
Sit down, Edward,
we need to talk.

01:03:09.219 --> 01:03:10.352
Marissa.

01:03:10.354 --> 01:03:12.420
Can I say something?

01:03:12.422 --> 01:03:12.420
You look beautiful.

01:03:12.422 --> 01:03:14.990
I mean, every time
i look into your eyes

01:03:14.992 --> 01:03:17.292
you're like in
slow motion.

01:03:17.294 --> 01:03:18.794
It's called jetlag.

01:03:18.796 --> 01:03:20.462
Sit your ass down.

01:03:21.297 --> 01:03:23.298
Horowitz said that
there's some problems

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:23.298
with your collaboration.

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:28.003
I don't wanna talk about
horowitz and his stupid ideas.

01:03:28.005 --> 01:03:29.838
Those were my
stupid ideas, okay?

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:31.039
Your film is not working.

01:03:31.041 --> 01:03:33.475
He has a more
commercial sensibility.

01:03:33.477 --> 01:03:36.311
Let's...
Let's just, you know...

01:03:36.313 --> 01:03:40.081
Breathe in, absorb
the surroundings.

01:03:40.083 --> 01:03:42.083
-This is beautiful, isn't it?
-Hm.

01:03:42.085 --> 01:03:44.419
Let's remember that you're
a woman and I'm a man.

01:03:44.421 --> 01:03:46.054
Oh please, we already
did that part.

01:03:46.056 --> 01:03:47.989
Yeah, but I'm not talking
about sex only, you know?

01:03:47.991 --> 01:03:50.592
There's more to
me than that.

01:03:50.594 --> 01:03:53.161
You see, people assume
things all the time.

01:03:53.163 --> 01:03:56.565
They look at you and they
think oh my god, she's gold.

01:03:56.567 --> 01:03:59.367
Very tough, very strong
bitch who like fucked her

01:03:59.369 --> 01:03:59.367
way up to the top.

01:03:59.369 --> 01:04:02.571
But the problem is that
you're really beautiful.

01:04:02.573 --> 01:04:04.573
They can't see past that.

01:04:05.842 --> 01:04:08.310
Yeah, you're right.

01:04:08.312 --> 01:04:09.878
The beauty
makes it harder.

01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:11.646
Well the same thing
happens to me.

01:04:11.648 --> 01:04:13.648
People look at me and
they think oh my god,

01:04:13.650 --> 01:04:13.648
he's Mr. action director.

01:04:13.650 --> 01:04:17.886
You know, j-force this, j-force
that, j-force fuck me that.

01:04:17.888 --> 01:04:19.187
Well they think
you're a cock.

01:04:19.189 --> 01:04:22.157
Yes, but that's a
small side of me.

01:04:22.159 --> 01:04:24.025
There's this other side
which I'm beginning to

01:04:24.027 --> 01:04:27.329
accept and that's
my vulnerable side.

01:04:27.331 --> 01:04:29.064
My feminine side.

01:04:29.066 --> 01:04:31.499
This is the reason why i
wanted to do this movie.

01:04:31.501 --> 01:04:34.569
I want people to see me
the way I really am.

01:04:36.405 --> 01:04:38.006
Wow.

01:04:39.976 --> 01:04:42.210
I'm really glad we had
this conversation, Edward.

01:04:42.212 --> 01:04:44.246
I had no idea that you felt
that way. And you know what?

01:04:44.248 --> 01:04:48.183
I really think that deep down,
you and I have a lot in common.

01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:52.587
So you wanna fuck or what?

01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:58.927
No.

01:04:58.929 --> 01:05:01.196
Yes. Yes, we will.

01:05:01.198 --> 01:05:02.530
-On set.
-Why?

01:05:02.532 --> 01:05:04.165
Because it's an adventure.

01:05:04.167 --> 01:05:05.600
So we will do it
in the trailer.

01:05:05.602 --> 01:05:09.271
You know, we will do it
like old Hollywood style.

01:05:09.273 --> 01:05:11.039
-Oh.
-Okay?

01:05:11.041 --> 01:05:12.474
You look beautiful.

01:06:25.114 --> 01:06:26.247
Hi.

01:06:26.582 --> 01:06:28.016
Welcome.

01:06:28.351 --> 01:06:29.751
First time here?

01:06:29.753 --> 01:06:31.086
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

01:06:31.088 --> 01:06:32.721
May I get you some water?

01:06:32.723 --> 01:06:33.788
-Coffee?
-No, I'm fine.

01:06:33.790 --> 01:06:35.290
Glass of champagne?

01:06:35.292 --> 01:06:36.624
I'm fine.

01:06:36.626 --> 01:06:41.429
I, um, called to
ask for the...

01:06:41.431 --> 01:06:45.667
Uh, you know, about the...
Prosthetic.

01:06:45.669 --> 01:06:48.303
Yeah, follow me.

01:06:51.574 --> 01:06:53.541
We have a wide variety
of prosthetics for all

01:06:53.543 --> 01:06:53.541
shapes and sizes.

01:06:53.543 --> 01:06:58.813
We use plexi-filled plastic
with micro vibrators built in.

01:06:58.815 --> 01:07:00.548
It feels a lot like
wearing a thick condom.

01:07:00.550 --> 01:07:02.450
They receiver will never
know the difference.

01:07:02.452 --> 01:07:04.619
We'll make a custom mold
beforehand and then you

01:07:04.621 --> 01:07:06.721
pick the size and
shape you want.

01:07:07.723 --> 01:07:10.058
Do you have like um...

01:07:10.060 --> 01:07:12.727
Like the high-end
version of molds.

01:07:12.729 --> 01:07:15.697
We do have one item that
is particularly special

01:07:15.699 --> 01:07:17.298
and will fulfill
all your needs.

01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:19.067
Hold on a second.

01:07:26.843 --> 01:07:30.545
It's the most amazing
model you'll ever see.

01:07:38.454 --> 01:07:42.490
This is the supremus.

01:07:42.492 --> 01:07:42.490
Wow.

01:07:42.492 --> 01:07:46.361
What you're looking at
is state of the art.

01:07:46.363 --> 01:07:49.130
If NASA were to build a
penis, this would be it.

01:07:49.132 --> 01:07:51.232
The texture ripples just
like it's your own skin.

01:07:51.234 --> 01:07:53.234
It's like it's alive.

01:07:53.236 --> 01:07:55.303
How much does it cost?

01:07:55.305 --> 01:07:57.372
The price is on that tag.

01:07:58.874 --> 01:08:01.276
Whoa.
Ho-ho-ho.

01:08:01.278 --> 01:08:03.445
No, that's like an
expensive car. I know.

01:08:03.447 --> 01:08:05.713
With a car, you
can only drive.

01:08:05.715 --> 01:08:07.615
This will make you fly.

01:09:03.471 --> 01:09:05.340
I love the way
you touch me.

01:09:14.649 --> 01:09:16.651
May I kiss you,
my darling?

01:09:18.487 --> 01:09:21.456
It's been so long since
I've touched those lips.

01:09:44.979 --> 01:09:46.915
Let's dance.

01:10:06.001 --> 01:10:07.535
Bath time.

01:10:14.577 --> 01:10:14.576
No!

01:10:14.578 --> 01:10:16.978
-What are you doing here?
-Give her to me!

01:10:16.980 --> 01:10:18.279
-No, stop it!
-Give it!

01:10:20.984 --> 01:10:23.251
-No!
-Ah!

01:10:28.592 --> 01:10:29.724
Give it back!

01:10:30.726 --> 01:10:32.694
That was amazing.

01:10:33.295 --> 01:10:34.028
That's it?

01:10:34.030 --> 01:10:35.430
Yes, let's go!

01:10:35.831 --> 01:10:36.497
No!

01:10:58.988 --> 01:11:00.455
Welcome.

01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:42.764
With no ham.

01:11:42.766 --> 01:11:44.599
-Woo!
-Woo!

01:12:07.556 --> 01:12:08.690
Ooh!

01:12:56.572 --> 01:12:57.939
Ha!

01:13:02.177 --> 01:13:04.879
In the manual it says you
provide a complimentary

01:13:04.881 --> 01:13:07.515
24-hour emergency
repair service.

01:13:07.517 --> 01:13:08.750
Page one!

01:13:08.752 --> 01:13:10.418
Yeah, it does say that!

01:13:10.420 --> 01:13:12.053
Smoke, white. White smoke.

01:13:12.055 --> 01:13:12.053
It says waterproof.

01:13:12.055 --> 01:13:15.156
How am I supposed to know
that it was only fresh water?

01:13:15.158 --> 01:13:15.156
Yes, I was happy.

01:13:15.158 --> 01:13:18.593
Yes, I was going to the
water because I was happy.

01:13:18.595 --> 01:13:20.661
No, I don't wanna
join a group. No.

01:13:20.663 --> 01:13:22.063
Not even email, no.

01:13:22.065 --> 01:13:23.097
I could have died.

01:13:23.099 --> 01:13:24.165
It started to
hurt really bad.

01:13:24.167 --> 01:13:25.600
It started to
smell really foul.

01:13:25.602 --> 01:13:28.469
Imagine dying by
electric shock penis.

01:13:28.471 --> 01:13:30.538
What? It's not my problem
it comes from China.

01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:31.939
Just send a new one.
You can't?

01:13:31.941 --> 01:13:33.808
I don't care about
hygiene at this point.

01:13:33.810 --> 01:13:34.976
Security concerns?

01:13:34.978 --> 01:13:36.544
Can you pass me to a
manager or something?

01:13:36.546 --> 01:13:38.546
Oh, man! Oh...

01:13:38.548 --> 01:13:39.714
Thanks for nothing.

01:13:54.029 --> 01:13:55.596
Hey.

01:13:55.598 --> 01:13:56.631
Baby.

01:13:56.633 --> 01:13:58.566
How you feeling, baby?
You okay?

01:13:59.535 --> 01:14:00.568
Hey.

01:14:00.836 --> 01:14:02.603
Have some water.

01:14:02.605 --> 01:14:04.639
We have a long
journey ahead of us.

01:14:05.607 --> 01:14:06.908
Where are we going?

01:14:06.910 --> 01:14:08.609
Home.

01:14:08.611 --> 01:14:10.111
Where I can take
care of you.

01:14:10.113 --> 01:14:12.246
Where you can have a
normal life again.

01:14:12.248 --> 01:14:13.981
It's for the best.

01:14:17.553 --> 01:14:18.953
Where's my book?

01:14:19.988 --> 01:14:21.522
It's right here.

01:14:21.524 --> 01:14:23.658
You wanna work on
it for a while?

01:14:23.660 --> 01:14:25.092
We have a long flight.

01:14:26.094 --> 01:14:27.762
Just take it easy.

01:14:27.764 --> 01:14:30.198
Everything's
gonna be okay.

01:14:49.117 --> 01:14:50.685
They're in their
helicopter.

01:14:50.687 --> 01:14:53.588
The thing on top is
spinning around and Dale

01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:55.490
convinces her to stop
writing the book.

01:14:55.492 --> 01:14:57.525
It's torturing you he says.
It's driving you mad.

01:14:57.527 --> 01:15:01.762
He throws it out and he takes
that moment to propose to her.

01:15:01.764 --> 01:15:04.298
She says, "si, senor" or however
they say it in Brazilian.

01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:05.600
-We'll do the research.
-That's terrible.

01:15:05.602 --> 01:15:07.568
And they kiss
in slow motion.

01:15:07.570 --> 01:15:08.803
No!

01:15:08.805 --> 01:15:10.872
-Credits.
-No, no, no, no!

01:15:10.874 --> 01:15:10.872
No, that sounds...

01:15:10.874 --> 01:15:14.308
I mean, I already did the
compromise with the hair

01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:15.743
-and with the helicopter.
-That's not a compromise.

01:15:15.745 --> 01:15:15.743
That was good hair.

01:15:15.745 --> 01:15:17.778
Horowitz, I'm trying
my best, okay?

01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:19.080
Well your best is
not good enough.

01:15:19.082 --> 01:15:21.115
We already established
that, okay? Now...

01:15:21.117 --> 01:15:22.517
Let me tell you.

01:15:32.928 --> 01:15:34.295
Sorry I'm late.

01:15:34.297 --> 01:15:35.763
Good morning, horowitz.

01:15:35.765 --> 01:15:35.763
Hello, Eddie.

01:15:35.765 --> 01:15:39.233
I read the new script and
i know that you had some

01:15:39.235 --> 01:15:41.335
alternate endings that
you wanted to discuss so

01:15:41.337 --> 01:15:42.637
we'll be in the trailer.

01:15:42.639 --> 01:15:44.238
No, can we do this
at lunch time?

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:45.940
-Horowitz!
-Lunch!

01:15:45.942 --> 01:15:47.208
Lunch, everyone.

01:15:47.210 --> 01:15:48.676
Alright, people.

01:15:48.678 --> 01:15:50.311
Let's get some...

01:15:56.985 --> 01:15:58.019
What's that for?

01:15:58.021 --> 01:15:58.019
Okay, here's how
it's gonna go down.

01:15:58.021 --> 01:16:00.821
We're gonna go inside.
We're gonna wait for a boy.

01:16:00.823 --> 01:16:01.923
We're gonna destroy
the paperwork.

01:16:01.925 --> 01:16:03.591
He's gonna come
for us with a gun.

01:16:03.593 --> 01:16:05.192
Probably something
used for protection.

01:16:05.194 --> 01:16:06.827
Probably an antique
elephant rifle.

01:16:06.829 --> 01:16:08.062
We're gonna
kill him first.

01:16:09.197 --> 01:16:10.965
We're gonna go back to
his house, get the coke,

01:16:10.967 --> 01:16:13.134
and then we're gonna throw the
body off the burlington skyway.

01:16:13.136 --> 01:16:14.602
How do you know
all this stuff?

01:16:14.604 --> 01:16:17.038
I've been in this exact
same situation before.

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:18.272
Okay?

01:16:18.274 --> 01:16:21.576
I'm doing it right this time.
I'm not going back to prison.

01:16:21.578 --> 01:16:22.877
This is stupid.

01:16:22.879 --> 01:16:25.112
Everything is so
stupid right now.

01:16:25.114 --> 01:16:27.715
Yeah, well you're so
stupid right now.

01:16:27.717 --> 01:16:29.150
Come on, let's go.

01:16:31.053 --> 01:16:32.954
Where'd you put the purchase
order? I can't find it.

01:16:32.956 --> 01:16:34.956
It's right there.
It's under l.

01:16:35.657 --> 01:16:35.656
No, that's not it.

01:16:35.658 --> 01:16:37.692
Where the fuck
do you put it?

01:16:37.694 --> 01:16:39.026
I don't know!

01:16:39.028 --> 01:16:41.195
Fuck, Emma! This is not
a fucking game. Okay?

01:16:41.197 --> 01:16:42.863
If we don't find it,
we will go to jail.

01:16:42.865 --> 01:16:45.833
And trust me, with those tits,
you will be eaten alive.

01:16:45.835 --> 01:16:48.202
So look for the
fucking paperwork.

01:16:48.770 --> 01:16:49.837
God damnit!

01:16:50.807 --> 01:16:52.974
Come on, come on.
Up we go.

01:16:52.976 --> 01:16:54.775
I need my ad to
know that I'm here.

01:16:54.777 --> 01:16:56.043
Guys, if anything
happens in here!

01:16:56.045 --> 01:16:57.645
No, this is not what
i was looking for.

01:16:57.647 --> 01:16:58.980
I mean, it's not
Hollywood style.

01:16:58.982 --> 01:16:58.980
It's perfect.
What do you mean?

01:16:58.982 --> 01:17:01.115
You know, it doesn't
have a fire escape.

01:17:01.117 --> 01:17:01.115
-I mean, we need...
-Oh, come on.

01:17:01.117 --> 01:17:03.651
I don't have a whole
lot of time, right?

01:17:03.653 --> 01:17:04.719
Wait, wait!

01:17:05.120 --> 01:17:05.119
Hang on, hang on!
No, no, no.

01:17:05.121 --> 01:17:08.022
Let's have a drink. You know,
let's talk a little.

01:17:08.024 --> 01:17:09.390
-What do you mean, talk?
-Let's have a drink.

01:17:09.392 --> 01:17:10.992
I'll get some ice! Yeah!

01:17:10.994 --> 01:17:13.160
I am not thirsty.
I am hungry. Come on.

01:17:13.162 --> 01:17:15.262
Wait, no, no! Marissa,
no, no, just...

01:17:15.831 --> 01:17:16.931
God!

01:17:16.933 --> 01:17:17.932
No, no!

01:17:18.834 --> 01:17:19.734
No!

01:17:22.738 --> 01:17:22.737
Fuck!

01:17:22.739 --> 01:17:25.172
This is such a
ridiculous situation.

01:17:28.977 --> 01:17:32.446
Why is everything such a
weird, convoluted mess?

01:17:32.448 --> 01:17:33.648
Oh, I don't know.

01:17:33.650 --> 01:17:33.648
Why don't you tell me?

01:17:33.650 --> 01:17:33.648
I was perfectly happy
with the way things were.

01:17:33.650 --> 01:17:38.352
Then you had to go and get
those insane fucking mega

01:17:38.354 --> 01:17:40.454
tits and everything
went to shit!

01:17:40.456 --> 01:17:42.189
Don't you see when you do
something that is just

01:17:42.191 --> 01:17:43.924
wrong there are
consequences?

01:17:43.926 --> 01:17:43.924
It's called Karma.

01:17:43.926 --> 01:17:46.427
The universe doesn't like
it when you fuck with it.

01:17:46.429 --> 01:17:48.195
It fucks you back.

01:17:48.197 --> 01:17:50.131
I wish we could just erase
all this stupid shit that

01:17:50.133 --> 01:17:52.099
you've done, but we can't.
That's not the world works.

01:17:52.101 --> 01:17:55.069
So look for the
fucking paperwork.

01:18:03.211 --> 01:18:06.881
Emma realizes that Karma
has come back to haunt her.

01:18:07.149 --> 01:18:10.051
Shrinking Edward's penis
may have caused her life

01:18:10.053 --> 01:18:12.920
to turn into the
nightmare it has become.

01:18:13.955 --> 01:18:15.289
What the fuck
are you doing?

01:18:15.291 --> 01:18:16.924
Fixing things.

01:18:29.137 --> 01:18:31.138
Oh!

01:18:35.343 --> 01:18:37.178
There's my boy.

01:18:42.418 --> 01:18:44.085
Keep rolling,
keep rolling.

01:18:44.087 --> 01:18:45.953
Tell them to move
in on the book.

01:18:45.955 --> 01:18:47.788
-Adrian, get in here.
-I wanna see the word.

01:18:47.790 --> 01:18:49.056
Tighter!

01:18:49.058 --> 01:18:50.991
Tell them I wanna
read the words.

01:18:50.993 --> 01:18:52.359
Horowitz! Horowitz!

01:18:52.361 --> 01:18:52.359
-Give me my chair.
-Do you mind?

01:18:52.361 --> 01:18:55.162
-I'm shooting a scene.
-Give me my chair. Give me my...

01:18:55.164 --> 01:18:56.497
-It's my movie.
-It's my chair!

01:18:56.499 --> 01:18:56.497
It's my movie!

01:18:56.499 --> 01:18:58.499
Okay, I'm gonna
take control of it.

01:18:58.501 --> 01:18:59.900
Come on, just!

01:19:00.535 --> 01:19:02.036
So...

01:19:03.038 --> 01:19:05.106
-It's the book.
-Wait, wait.

01:19:05.108 --> 01:19:07.241
-You read the story boards.
-What the fuck?

01:19:07.243 --> 01:19:11.345
Emma returning Edward's
penis allows him to regain

01:19:11.347 --> 01:19:14.148
control of his film.

01:19:14.150 --> 01:19:16.917
It's just words.
What are you doing?

01:19:20.456 --> 01:19:21.355
Alright.

01:19:21.357 --> 01:19:22.923
I've had enough of this.

01:19:22.925 --> 01:19:24.925
I want my name
on the chair.

01:19:24.927 --> 01:19:26.060
Who's in ch--

01:19:31.367 --> 01:19:32.833
okay. Alright, alright,
alright! Come on!

01:19:32.835 --> 01:19:32.833
Mustache guy's gonna
be here any minute.

01:19:32.835 --> 01:19:35.936
-Let's fucking go.
-I know. Okay, okay.

01:19:49.084 --> 01:19:50.484
How can he know?

01:19:50.486 --> 01:19:52.553
What do you mean,
how can I know?

01:19:53.421 --> 01:19:55.422
And what is
this all about?

01:19:55.424 --> 01:19:56.791
Do you think it's funny?

01:19:56.793 --> 01:19:58.058
Do you think it's funny?

01:19:58.060 --> 01:19:59.560
Shut up!

01:20:07.803 --> 01:20:08.869
Stop!

01:20:08.871 --> 01:20:09.603
Stop that.

01:20:10.907 --> 01:20:12.573
You can't do this.
I created you.

01:20:12.575 --> 01:20:14.175
You're just a part
of my imagination.

01:20:14.177 --> 01:20:15.442
Your imagination?
You're...

01:20:15.444 --> 01:20:17.378
You're part of
Michelle's imagination.

01:20:17.380 --> 01:20:18.979
You only exist
in her book.

01:20:42.404 --> 01:20:44.939
Emma returning Edward's
penis allows him to regain

01:20:44.941 --> 01:20:46.240
control of his film.

01:20:53.415 --> 01:20:54.648
Oh shit, oh shit!

01:20:56.051 --> 01:20:57.218
Shit, that's him!

01:20:59.287 --> 01:21:00.421
Where the fuck is my shit?

01:21:00.423 --> 01:21:01.555
Who the fuck are you?

01:21:01.557 --> 01:21:03.958
You know damn well
I'm Carl stromway.

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:04.992
Who?

01:21:04.994 --> 01:21:06.660
She knows who I am.
Don't you?

01:21:06.662 --> 01:21:08.095
Yeah, good to see
you too, neighbor.

01:21:08.097 --> 01:21:09.163
Look I don't
want no trouble.

01:21:09.165 --> 01:21:10.331
I just came for my shit.

01:21:10.333 --> 01:21:10.331
Yeah, we don't
have you're shit.

01:21:10.333 --> 01:21:13.267
I know you have it.
I broke into her apartment

01:21:13.269 --> 01:21:14.268
and I found my dumbbell.

01:21:14.270 --> 01:21:16.136
You broke into
her fucking place?

01:21:16.138 --> 01:21:18.672
122? Man, I'm at 120!

01:21:19.608 --> 01:21:21.075
Don't even go there!
I ain't the bad guy.

01:21:21.077 --> 01:21:23.010
She stole from me.
Now where the fuck is it?

01:21:25.313 --> 01:21:27.214
It's my wife's head
and I want it back.

01:21:27.216 --> 01:21:29.617
Hey, dude.
We can sort this out.

01:21:29.619 --> 01:21:31.485
Okay, we just need a minute
or two to empty the head.

01:21:31.487 --> 01:21:33.587
What in the hell? What kind
of sick shit is this?

01:21:35.190 --> 01:21:35.189
Who are you?

01:21:35.191 --> 01:21:37.925
Why's everybody keep asking
like y'all ain't got Internet?

01:21:37.927 --> 01:21:38.959
I'm Carl motherfucking
stromway.

01:21:38.961 --> 01:21:40.594
I got like 20,000 hits.

01:21:40.596 --> 01:21:42.529
Celebrity
personal trainer.

01:21:43.231 --> 01:21:45.466
Forget it. The coke you
done stuffed into that

01:21:45.468 --> 01:21:47.001
rubber lady's face
there is mine.

01:21:47.003 --> 01:21:48.235
Excuse me.

01:21:48.937 --> 01:21:50.938
Did you say
personal trainer?

01:21:50.940 --> 01:21:53.140
I'm the personal trainer.

01:21:53.142 --> 01:21:54.575
Oh, that's the wrong thing
you wanna be right now.

01:21:54.577 --> 01:21:55.676
Motherfucker!

01:21:56.445 --> 01:21:58.913
Baby, you're the best.

01:21:59.381 --> 01:22:00.581
Darling.

01:22:00.583 --> 01:22:03.550
Emma's mind feels like
it's about to explode.

01:22:05.253 --> 01:22:07.655
She starts
hearing a voice.

01:22:07.657 --> 01:22:10.057
The voice of her creator.

01:22:10.059 --> 01:22:12.226
The one writing her story.

01:22:13.094 --> 01:22:15.629
She finally understands
everything.

01:22:15.631 --> 01:22:18.666
Even with all the
chaos surrounding her.

01:22:20.168 --> 01:22:22.469
Who the fuck are you?

01:22:22.471 --> 01:22:24.371
It's Michelle, right?

01:22:24.373 --> 01:22:26.273
Emma, get the
fuck out of there!

01:22:26.275 --> 01:22:29.576
You're in Edward
Deacon's movie!

01:22:29.578 --> 01:22:33.280
You think you're so mighty,
but you're just his creation.

01:22:33.282 --> 01:22:37.184
You're just his creation,
Emma says to Michelle.

01:22:43.558 --> 01:22:44.758
Dale!

01:22:46.661 --> 01:22:49.296
I'm in my book.
I mean...

01:22:49.298 --> 01:22:50.431
Whoa, what are you
talking about?

01:22:50.433 --> 01:22:52.666
My book.
I'm in it.

01:22:52.668 --> 01:22:54.301
Okay, that's enough.

01:22:54.303 --> 01:22:56.437
This book is
making you crazy.

01:23:08.683 --> 01:23:09.783
Edward?

01:23:13.722 --> 01:23:14.688
Edward?

01:23:15.290 --> 01:23:16.690
Deacon?

01:23:16.692 --> 01:23:18.258
Can you hear me?

01:23:18.260 --> 01:23:19.226
Yes.

01:23:19.228 --> 01:23:20.794
-Do you mind?
-Michelle?

01:23:20.796 --> 01:23:22.196
What's going on?

01:23:22.198 --> 01:23:23.464
I don't know!

01:23:23.466 --> 01:23:24.431
I don't know.

01:23:24.433 --> 01:23:25.466
You tell me
what's going on.

01:23:25.468 --> 01:23:26.266
Thank god you're here.

01:23:26.268 --> 01:23:27.468
I want him off the set.

01:23:27.470 --> 01:23:28.535
He's completely lost it.

01:23:28.537 --> 01:23:29.570
Eddie is the
director again.

01:23:29.572 --> 01:23:31.238
What?

01:23:33.074 --> 01:23:34.074
-No!
-Look at him.

01:23:34.076 --> 01:23:35.275
He's completely
unreliable.

01:23:35.277 --> 01:23:36.577
He's talking
to the monitor.

01:23:36.579 --> 01:23:38.245
No, no, no, no, no, no!

01:23:38.247 --> 01:23:39.446
He's throwing
away the book, no!

01:23:39.448 --> 01:23:41.415
Yes, he throws the book.
That's the plot.

01:23:41.417 --> 01:23:42.616
No! He can't throw
away the book!

01:23:44.085 --> 01:23:46.220
Michelle, grab the book.

01:23:46.222 --> 01:23:48.789
Because if you lose
it, we disappear.

01:23:55.130 --> 01:23:56.597
Michelle, no!

01:24:17.585 --> 01:24:19.153
Don't you get it!

01:24:19.155 --> 01:24:21.121
Don't you see
what's happening!

01:24:21.123 --> 01:24:22.790
Just give me my coke!

01:24:22.792 --> 01:24:24.758
Give me back my Jenny!

01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:26.794
This is crazy!

01:24:44.145 --> 01:24:45.312
Oh my god!

01:24:45.314 --> 01:24:46.847
What the fuck is going on?

01:24:46.849 --> 01:24:47.848
What's happening?

01:24:47.850 --> 01:24:47.848
Guys, you see this!

01:24:47.850 --> 01:24:50.417
-Hey, hey!
-What's happening? What...

01:24:53.655 --> 01:24:54.788
No!

01:24:56.291 --> 01:24:57.591
Okay.

01:24:57.593 --> 01:24:58.625
Alright.

01:24:58.627 --> 01:25:00.661
-It's on me now.
-Michelle!

01:25:00.663 --> 01:25:01.795
Keep going.
Just grab the book.

01:25:01.797 --> 01:25:03.330
Completely disgusting.

01:25:03.332 --> 01:25:04.798
Grab the book!

01:26:52.708 --> 01:26:54.208
What the fuck?

01:26:54.210 --> 01:26:56.643
You're kidding me, right?
That's the fucking ending.

01:26:56.645 --> 01:26:56.643
That's the ending.

01:26:56.645 --> 01:26:58.779
You call that a
fucking ending?

01:26:58.781 --> 01:26:58.779
It's not my ending!

01:26:58.781 --> 01:27:01.748
This will be the last
time any of us work.

01:27:01.750 --> 01:27:04.017
Yeah, we're not gonna work
because we have no bodies.

01:27:04.019 --> 01:27:04.885
We're smeared!

01:27:04.887 --> 01:27:06.253
That's another issue.

01:27:07.488 --> 01:27:07.487
Can you move
your hand please?

01:27:07.489 --> 01:27:11.291
It's in an area that I don't
feel comfortable with.

01:27:11.593 --> 01:27:11.592
Move your hand.

01:27:12.305 --> 01:27:18.601
