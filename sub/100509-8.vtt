WEBVTT

00:16.474 --> 00:18.018
Prisoners in peril.

00:18.101 --> 00:19.978
Former Jedi apprentice, Ahsoka Tano,

00:20.061 --> 00:22.981
befriended two sisters,
Trace and Rafa Martez,

00:23.064 --> 00:25.650
who grew up
in the underworld of Coruscant.

00:25.734 --> 00:27.902
After learning that the sisters blamed
the Jedi Knights

00:27.986 --> 00:29.320
for the death of their parents,

00:29.404 --> 00:32.490
Ahsoka must decide
if she's willing to reveal her Jedi past

00:32.574 --> 00:35.326
and use her skills to aid in their escape.

00:35.827 --> 00:38.830
Fearing her new friends
will feel betrayed by this revelation,

00:38.913 --> 00:41.750
Ahsoka is left with a difficult choice.

00:44.502 --> 00:47.422
Maybe we could pretend to be sick or dead.

00:48.173 --> 00:50.342
What do you think we should do, Ahsoka?

00:51.134 --> 00:52.677
Let's look at how we got here.

00:52.761 --> 00:54.929
Oh, I know the answer to that.

00:55.013 --> 00:59.267
We're here because you convinced Trace
to dump the spice and she did.

00:59.768 --> 01:02.145
I never told her to do that.

01:02.228 --> 01:04.314
Wait, so you're blaming me for this?

01:04.397 --> 01:06.524
If we went through with my original deal,

01:06.608 --> 01:09.319
we'd be back on Coruscant
counting our money right now.

01:09.694 --> 01:12.113
But your original deal was the problem.

01:12.405 --> 01:14.574
- For you!
- For me as well.

01:16.159 --> 01:17.786
When did this happen?

01:17.869 --> 01:18.787
What?

01:18.870 --> 01:20.288
The two of you against me.

01:20.372 --> 01:22.540
When it was always just you and me, Trace.

01:23.124 --> 01:24.125
Always.

01:24.376 --> 01:26.670
Rafa, I'm not choosing sides here.

01:27.128 --> 01:28.922
- I'm just...
- Just siding with her.

01:29.005 --> 01:30.965
Only in this case, Rafa.

01:31.049 --> 01:32.384
But I look out for you.

01:32.467 --> 01:34.552
She's your friend today.
But what about tomorrow?

01:34.636 --> 01:36.971
And the next day, what about then?

01:40.225 --> 01:41.935
You and I were always good.

01:42.352 --> 01:43.812
Good until she showed up.

01:48.233 --> 01:50.485
I think I know of a way
to get us out of here.

01:51.611 --> 01:52.779
What's your plan?

01:52.862 --> 01:54.280
It's better if you don't know.

01:54.364 --> 01:56.199
I hope it's better than your last one.

01:56.282 --> 01:58.451
Rafa, you need to trust me.

01:58.785 --> 02:01.413
Me, trust you?

02:01.746 --> 02:05.667
We each played a part in getting here,
now we need to do the same to get out.

02:05.750 --> 02:07.752
But we have to trust each other.

02:08.712 --> 02:10.296
What choice do I really have?

02:15.301 --> 02:16.845
Come with us.

02:25.895 --> 02:29.024
So, are you ready to make a choice?

02:29.107 --> 02:30.984
Depends what the choices are.

02:31.401 --> 02:32.402
Hmm.

02:32.485 --> 02:36.364
Pay your debt or watch your friends die...

02:37.198 --> 02:38.450
slowly.

02:38.783 --> 02:40.660
I want to cut a deal with you, alone.

02:40.744 --> 02:41.828
What?

02:41.911 --> 02:44.414
You would betray your friends?

02:46.708 --> 02:47.751
Trust me...

02:48.960 --> 02:50.211
they're not my friends.

02:51.379 --> 02:54.591
Where is my spice?

02:54.674 --> 02:58.136
They hid the spice off-world.
I don't know where.

02:58.970 --> 03:01.723
Send them to go get it
and give them one rotation.

03:01.806 --> 03:05.060
If they don't come back,
I'll tell you where their family's from.

03:05.143 --> 03:06.853
That should motivate them.

03:06.936 --> 03:08.563
Ahsoka, why would you say that?

03:08.646 --> 03:11.066
Because she's a snake,
just like I warned you.

03:11.149 --> 03:14.027
And what do you get out of all this?

03:14.402 --> 03:15.653
Just my percentage.

03:16.071 --> 03:18.531
A small price to pay
for a rather large spice shipment,

03:18.615 --> 03:20.116
once it's returned to you.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.581
Very well.

03:26.664 --> 03:31.169
You have one rotation
to bring back my spice.

03:31.628 --> 03:32.921
If you don't,

03:33.338 --> 03:37.592
I'll torture the information
out of your friend here.

03:37.676 --> 03:42.847
And kill her, you and your family.

03:49.270 --> 03:50.939
I won't forget this.

03:59.406 --> 04:02.200
This is another deception.

04:02.909 --> 04:06.830
I know. But I don't have much of a choice.

04:06.913 --> 04:09.499
I must regain that spice.

04:10.041 --> 04:13.461
My life depends on it as much as theirs.

04:13.753 --> 04:17.424
You think he will find out about this?

04:17.882 --> 04:22.137
He knows. He always knows.

04:28.518 --> 04:32.188
Better be quick and bring back the spice.

04:51.875 --> 04:54.544
I didn't scan the Jedi
leaving with the others.

04:55.545 --> 04:56.629
Keep watch.

04:57.255 --> 04:59.591
I wanna know
the instant she leaves the Citadel.

05:03.345 --> 05:04.637
What are you up to?

05:30.163 --> 05:32.457
I still don't understand
what Ahsoka was thinking.

05:32.540 --> 05:34.459
She knows we don't have any family.

05:34.542 --> 05:36.169
Uh, exactly.

05:37.003 --> 05:40.840
But she has no leverage.
We don't have to go back.

05:41.341 --> 05:47.055
What she did back there,
giving herself up for us. That's rare.

05:47.555 --> 05:49.057
You don't see that much.

05:49.516 --> 05:51.267
You mean that was her plan?

05:52.060 --> 05:56.898
I thought that was clear.
"Trust me." Come on, Trace.

05:57.774 --> 06:01.945
Okay. But if that's true,
how is she gonna escape?

06:02.696 --> 06:04.948
I don't know.
But I'm not gonna let her try

06:05.031 --> 06:08.535
because if she does,
she'll hold it over my head.

06:08.993 --> 06:12.330
Wait, you're going back to help her,
so you can one-up her?

06:12.414 --> 06:13.665
Now you're catching on.

06:14.290 --> 06:17.544
So, how do we rescue Ahsoka
without getting captured again?

06:18.211 --> 06:20.797
By delivering the spice, of course.

07:05.175 --> 07:08.219
Since I'm here,
I might as well do some good.

07:25.862 --> 07:29.282
All right. I'll hail the receiving dock,
let them know we're here.

07:29.366 --> 07:33.912
So, we're stealing spice from the Pykes
to trade it back for Ahsoka?

07:33.995 --> 07:36.414
Yes, exactly. Now be quiet.

07:36.998 --> 07:40.835
This is transport 1519
coming in for a spice pickup.

07:41.711 --> 07:44.839
Um, there is no record of your shipment.

07:45.757 --> 07:47.425
There must be some kind of mix-up.

07:47.509 --> 07:49.678
I'll clear it all up
when I get on the ground.

07:50.345 --> 07:52.931
Oh, okay. Copy that.

07:53.765 --> 07:55.141
See, easy.

07:55.225 --> 07:59.562
If you're half as good at flying
as I am at this, we're in great shape.

08:15.662 --> 08:18.123
Hey. So, you got some spice for me?

08:18.206 --> 08:22.127
I told you, I do not have your shipment
listed anywhere.

08:22.210 --> 08:24.838
You've never done
a special request pickup?

08:24.921 --> 08:26.548
Ha! Very rarely.

08:26.923 --> 08:30.176
Then today is one of those
"very rarely" situations.

08:30.260 --> 08:32.929
Look, pal,
I don't want to get you in trouble,

08:33.013 --> 08:35.807
but this is coming from up top,
if you know what I mean.

08:35.890 --> 08:39.019
So why don't you just start
loading the spice onto my ship?

08:39.519 --> 08:42.230
But, but I can't just give it to you.

08:42.313 --> 08:45.817
Hey, I'm following instructions,
you should too.

08:45.900 --> 08:48.361
Start loading things up.
I'm on a tight schedule.

08:48.445 --> 08:49.612
B... But. B... B...

08:49.696 --> 08:52.323
If it makes you feel better,
go find your boss.

08:52.407 --> 08:56.286
But when he asks what the holdup is,
I'm gonna tell him it's your fault.

08:56.369 --> 08:59.956
So, while you go get in trouble,
I'm gonna start loading up my ship.

09:01.082 --> 09:03.918
Come on, guys. Let's get moving.

09:36.034 --> 09:40.038
I assure you,
this delay does not change things.

09:40.538 --> 09:42.540
We will proceed as planned.

09:43.667 --> 09:50.131
You are but one small piece moving
in this mechanism which I have designed.

09:50.215 --> 09:55.470
And yet when you falter,
it jeopardizes everything.

09:55.553 --> 09:58.473
Do you understand?

09:58.556 --> 10:03.478
I understand that the Republic
is cracking down on my operations.

10:03.561 --> 10:08.149
Just a week ago they raided
one of my shipments arriving on Coruscant.

10:09.359 --> 10:11.444
Were there Jedi?

10:12.696 --> 10:15.323
I don't know. None of my men made it out.

10:16.825 --> 10:19.577
Hmm. Well, then the answer is yes.

10:41.599 --> 10:45.937
I have things to attend to
other than your incompetence.

10:46.021 --> 10:48.440
Make sure there are no more delays.

10:48.523 --> 10:54.863
And if there are, I am certain
Crimson Dawn would love the opportunity

10:54.946 --> 10:58.033
to take control of your operation.

11:00.285 --> 11:03.204
He plays members of the Collective
against one another.

11:03.663 --> 11:07.751
An efficient way
to deal with our kind of business.

11:08.418 --> 11:12.589
Surely Maul knows
we do not jump to his demand.

11:13.048 --> 11:15.717
Would you care to make that clear to him?

11:23.350 --> 11:25.935
Sir, come quickly.
The prisoner has escaped.

11:47.165 --> 11:48.583
The transmission log.

11:49.668 --> 11:51.836
Let's find out where you are.

11:54.923 --> 11:58.426
Mandalore? What's Maul doing there?

11:58.510 --> 12:01.096
I knew you were no petty smuggler.

12:01.388 --> 12:02.430
Who are you?

12:23.118 --> 12:24.369
A Jedi.

12:24.869 --> 12:27.497
Are your friends Jedi as well?

12:28.123 --> 12:31.084
No. Just me. They have no idea.

12:31.793 --> 12:36.881
Well then, the Jedi Council will regret
sending you here.

12:54.733 --> 12:56.151
Miss.

12:56.234 --> 12:58.236
Uh, excuse me, Miss. Um.

12:58.319 --> 13:02.157
I cannot find it anywhere on the manifest
for you to have this spice.

13:02.240 --> 13:05.410
And my manager said
this is highly irregular. Yes.

13:05.493 --> 13:08.413
Where is he? I don't see any manager.

13:08.496 --> 13:11.374
You just don't want to do the work.
That's it, isn't it?

13:11.833 --> 13:14.002
- Uh, Rafa.
- Not now.

13:14.544 --> 13:16.463
So, where is this manager, huh?

13:16.713 --> 13:17.797
Rafa, stop!

13:18.131 --> 13:19.674
There isn't one, is there?

13:19.758 --> 13:21.217
You little liar.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.928
He's right behind you.

13:24.012 --> 13:25.180
All right.

13:25.430 --> 13:26.681
Oh.

13:26.765 --> 13:30.518
You don't have authorization to be here.
I'm shutting you down.

13:30.852 --> 13:35.190
Authorization? Uh, yeah. Of course.
Makes sense.

13:37.025 --> 13:39.152
Let me see the ship's manifest.

13:39.235 --> 13:40.236
Great idea.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.614
Trace, why don't you give him
the manifest?

13:42.697 --> 13:44.866
What? I mean, right.

13:44.949 --> 13:47.269
- I, I, I left it on the ship.
- You're not going anywhere.

13:47.911 --> 13:51.748
Hey. What do you know?
I got your manifest right here.

13:55.543 --> 13:57.212
Yes. Kill her.

14:07.639 --> 14:08.640
Ah!

14:08.723 --> 14:10.934
Yes. Yes, get her. Get her.

14:35.166 --> 14:36.835
- Ah!
- Ah!

14:37.961 --> 14:38.962
Oh, no.

14:59.899 --> 15:00.900
What?

15:02.819 --> 15:03.987
See ya, pal.

15:11.202 --> 15:13.371
Come on. Who's next?

15:14.748 --> 15:18.001
Hey. Hey. Whoa. It's me.

15:18.626 --> 15:20.462
Nice work. Come on.

15:41.649 --> 15:43.401
I want to thank you.

15:43.485 --> 15:47.614
Your execution
will help restore the Pykes' reputation.

15:47.697 --> 15:50.033
Your timing is perfect.

15:51.034 --> 15:53.495
Speaking of perfect timing.

15:53.578 --> 15:55.330
Stop what you're doing.

15:55.997 --> 16:00.502
Look, you don't have to execute her.
We brought your spice back.

16:00.585 --> 16:02.754
Foolish.

16:02.837 --> 16:07.467
We know you are both
working for the Republic and this Jedi.

16:07.926 --> 16:09.010
Jedi?

16:10.804 --> 16:13.473
Her, a Jedi? Come on.

16:14.641 --> 16:17.352
I see. So, it is true.

16:17.435 --> 16:19.688
The Jedi used you both.

16:20.230 --> 16:24.150
How unfortunate
that your stupidity is so authentic.

16:25.860 --> 16:27.112
Why didn't you tell me?

16:27.612 --> 16:31.074
How could I after what you told me
about your parents?

16:31.533 --> 16:34.452
Wait. So, you're actually a Jedi?

16:34.536 --> 16:35.995
Was a Jedi.

16:36.079 --> 16:37.122
So, you're not a Jedi?

16:37.205 --> 16:39.499
I was trained. But I left.

16:39.582 --> 16:40.709
You can do that?

16:40.792 --> 16:42.919
Prepare to execute them all.

16:43.003 --> 16:46.589
Look, now is really not the time
to explain all this.

16:47.882 --> 16:49.718
Yeah. You know when the time was?

16:50.760 --> 16:53.638
- When we were in prison.
- You should have told me.

17:12.240 --> 17:14.200
Come on.

17:15.952 --> 17:19.372
After them.
Or we'll all suffer the consequences.

17:35.638 --> 17:37.515
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you before,
Trace.

17:42.896 --> 17:44.981
Well, if you're a Jedi,
I assume you're a good shot?

17:45.398 --> 17:47.400
- Yes.
- Then shoot something.

17:55.241 --> 17:57.660
Got another one closing point 4-6.

18:03.500 --> 18:04.959
- Keep it tight.
- I'm on it.

18:05.043 --> 18:06.294
I'm banking right.

18:08.254 --> 18:09.255
- He bit...
- Got him.

18:17.389 --> 18:20.141
- We've lost the rear deflector shields.
- And the gun.

18:20.225 --> 18:21.351
Hang on.

18:22.727 --> 18:24.914
- What are you doing?
- We might have lost the rear deflectors,

18:24.938 --> 18:26.058
but we still have the front.

18:32.195 --> 18:33.571
Uh, this isn't a good idea.

18:33.655 --> 18:35.824
Yeah. I'm gonna agree with Ahsoka
on this one.

18:46.292 --> 18:47.669
Whoo-hoo!

18:48.128 --> 18:49.462
Glad we could help.

19:25.457 --> 19:29.210
Since the Pykes think I was an operative
working for the Jedi,

19:29.294 --> 19:31.671
I don't think they'll come looking for you
any time soon.

19:32.088 --> 19:33.173
So, maybe...

19:44.392 --> 19:48.188
So, you're not going to arrest me
for spice smuggling?

19:48.271 --> 19:51.149
- Why would I do that?
- Well, you're a Jedi, right?

19:51.232 --> 19:53.777
Don't you make a living
tracking down criminals like me?

19:54.152 --> 19:56.571
I told you, I was a Jedi.

19:56.654 --> 19:58.323
I don't understand.

19:58.823 --> 20:01.785
Why would anyone walk away
from being a Jedi?

20:02.952 --> 20:04.454
It's complicated.

20:04.996 --> 20:09.000
No offense but I don't want to hear
your complicated story.

20:09.084 --> 20:10.502
Let me level with you.

20:10.585 --> 20:14.589
You might not think of yourself as a Jedi,
but you act like one.

20:15.006 --> 20:16.966
Or at least how I want them to be.

20:17.634 --> 20:20.845
She's right. We got in over our heads.

20:20.929 --> 20:23.682
Without you, we'd be done for.

20:23.765 --> 20:27.185
Jedi or not, I consider you my friend.

20:28.937 --> 20:30.522
Isn't this sweet?

20:32.232 --> 20:33.400
Making friends?

20:33.983 --> 20:36.069
Trace. Rafa. Back away.

20:36.820 --> 20:38.571
So, you remember me.

20:39.114 --> 20:41.950
Don't worry. Death Watch is gone.

20:42.867 --> 20:46.579
And now, you and I have a common enemy.

20:48.039 --> 20:49.249
Maul.

20:50.667 --> 20:52.002
I need your help.

20:52.877 --> 20:54.963
Once we are underway
I will explain everything.

20:58.717 --> 21:00.802
You have five minutes to decide.

21:02.804 --> 21:05.974
Sounds like she needs your help,
just like we did.

21:06.349 --> 21:10.603
But if I go down this path,
I'm afraid where it might lead.

21:11.312 --> 21:13.481
You mean, back to the Jedi?

21:14.441 --> 21:15.567
Yes.

21:17.110 --> 21:19.612
Go. It's what you're meant to do.

21:20.071 --> 21:21.322
Rafa's right.

21:23.324 --> 21:24.367
All right.

21:24.701 --> 21:29.164
But let me keep my bike here,
just in case.

21:29.664 --> 21:30.749
Deal.
