You are cleared for takeoff.

Good work.
You're the best C.I.A. double ever.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.625
Just keep Francine
away from that dance.

Hi, Stan. Ah!

12:54.874 --> 12:58.071
Let's hit that dance, H.Q.

Please, please, allow me.

13:07.820 --> 13:10.288
The ladywill start with
the nicoise salad, her favorite...

13:10.389 --> 13:12.357
which she discovered
herjunioryear abroad.

13:12.458 --> 13:14.323
I can't believeyou rememberthat!

13:14.426 --> 13:16.951
For her entrée,
she'll have the pumpkin ravioli...

13:17.062 --> 13:20.031
the same dish she ordered
on their- our-our fourth date...

13:20.132 --> 13:23.067
which took place October 1 7, 1 987.

13:23.169 --> 13:25.603
Wow! Stan, I'm impressed.

13:25.704 --> 13:29.105
Unfortunately, she didn't realize that
her tampon had been in for two days...

13:29.208 --> 13:31.733
which led to a mild case oftoxic shock.

13:31.844 --> 13:34.972
At 2243, she was rushed
to the hospital by her roommate-

13:35.080 --> 13:38.277
and on one brave Saturday night,
sexual partner-Jeanie Stone, who-

13:38.384 --> 13:40.978
Okay. Seeyou at dessert.

13:41.086 --> 13:43.213
Have the violinist
play "Little Red Corvette."

13:43.322 --> 13:45.415
You requested my favorite song?

13:45.524 --> 13:49.984
All right. Who areyou?
And what have you done with my husband?

That's a great story
about being old and alone.

14:00.306 --> 14:02.774
It's likeyou've been
walking around dead for 20 years...

14:02.875 --> 14:06.811
and no one's had the decency to cremateyou
and sprinkleyour ashes over Old Maid Mountain.

14:06.912 --> 14:11.008
- Wow! That's quite a line.
- It's actually more ofan assessment ofyour life.

14:11.116 --> 14:14.950
I mean, the line to get in.
Whatyou just said was emotionally devastating.

14:15.054 --> 14:18.512
[ Laughing ]
I guess itwas. I guess itwas.

14:18.624 --> 14:22.025
But nowyou're the queen,
and we've got a spotlight to dance under!

14:22.127 --> 14:25.688
- [ Grunting, Screaming ]
- Thankyou for holding our place.

14:25.798 --> 14:28.892
- [Man] Hey!
- I'm with the homecoming queen,
and you know what that means.

14:29.001 --> 14:30.992
I know what it meant 20 years ago.

14:31.103 --> 14:35.597
But ifthat stuffis still important toyou,
it just means you're a real zero.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.608
[ Laughing ]

14:37.710 --> 14:39.735
- What a douche bag!
- Get a life, loser!

14:39.845 --> 14:41.745
Hey, I have a life!

14:41.847 --> 14:45.339
I have an important job, a house with
a giant flagpole, a great kid, another kid...

14:45.451 --> 14:48.079
and a beautiful wife who loves me
and thinks I'm a winner!

14:48.187 --> 14:52.180
I have a great life!
Oh, my God! I have a great life.

14:52.291 --> 14:54.987
So what the hell am I doing
with this train wreck?

14:55.094 --> 14:57.062
Well, it's been fun.
Do me a solid.

14:57.162 --> 15:00.097
Keep me out ofthe suicide note, huh?
[ Clicks Tongue ] Thanks.

15:00.199 --> 15:04.431
Hey, you know what? I feel like dancing.
Let's go to that reunion.

15:04.536 --> 15:08.370
No! I-I mean,
I wantyou all to myself.

15:08.474 --> 15:12.376
Oh! Well, then let's go back to Quacky's.

15:12.478 --> 15:16.608
I feel like getting freaky.
Third-drawer freaky!

15:16.715 --> 15:20.515
Okay. Let's go to the dance.
Yeah, dancing's good.

15:22.121 --> 15:26.387
Great. Another delivery,
another life lesson. Let's go, Mitch!

15:26.492 --> 15:30.258
No, Steve. You stay.
I'd like Roger to join me on this one.

15:30.362 --> 15:33.422
What? No! I-I'm your disciple.

15:33.532 --> 15:35.830
You chose me.
He doesn't even likeyou.

15:35.935 --> 15:39.098
I really don't. On your last delivery,
I put a tack on your seat.

15:39.204 --> 15:42.230
But apparently, it just split the cheeks.
Very disappointing.

15:44.310 --> 15:46.972
Oh, this is gonna be life changing.

15:48.013 --> 15:50.607
That was totally life changing!

15:50.716 --> 15:53.685
You're finally starting to get it, Roger.

15:54.954 --> 15:57.252
Hey, where's Steve? And the pizzas?

15:57.356 --> 16:00.450
- He has forsaken me.
- [Thunderclap ]

16:00.559 --> 16:03.687
I was supposed to be his messenger,
not Roger!

16:03.796 --> 16:07.664
How could he abandon me
after delivering such wisdom? [ Sobs ]

16:07.766 --> 16:11.532
In 30 minutes or less!

Hi there. I'm dining with a beautiful woman
somewhere in this restaurant.

16:19.378 --> 16:22.905
Could you ask me to discreetly excuse myself
so I can have a word with me?

I do not understand.
You left 1 5 minutes ago with yourwife.

16:26.418 --> 16:28.386
- Oh, crap! Where'd I go?
- The dance.

16:28.487 --> 16:30.751
The dance? But Betty Sue is there!

16:30.856 --> 16:34.121

and I forgot my keys!

Do you know what you've done?
You got Mitch fired!

17:19.371 --> 17:21.339
Why, Steve, why?

17:21.440 --> 17:23.407
Because he chose you over me.

17:23.509 --> 17:26.672
Steve, the truth I offer
isn't personal-pan-sized.

17:26.779 --> 17:30.442
