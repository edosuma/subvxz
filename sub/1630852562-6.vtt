07:16.594 --> 07:19.271
something you wanted to do
in the future with kids?

07:19.355 --> 07:21.431
- So I grew up Greek Orthodox,
super traditional.

07:21.524 --> 07:23.600
Like, four and a half hour
services

07:23.693 --> 07:24.860
where they speak
in Greek most of it.

07:25.019 --> 07:26.519
- Wow.
- And there's a lot of

07:26.612 --> 07:28.447
the traditions in Greek
Orthodox culture that I like.

07:28.606 --> 07:31.032
Like Holy Week, we talked
about in Greek Orthodox--

07:31.117 --> 07:32.200
Easter.
So I would definitely want

07:32.285 --> 07:33.618
our children to celebrate that

07:33.703 --> 07:35.704
'cause I think it's more
of a cultural celebration

07:35.863 --> 07:37.697
as well as a religious one.
- Mm-hmm.

07:37.781 --> 07:39.624
I'm okay with any church
as long as

07:39.709 --> 07:41.126
it's the right community.
- Right.

07:41.285 --> 07:42.961

my kids up in a church

07:43.045 --> 07:45.797
or at least give them
the fundamentals.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.549
But I think as soon
as our kids are old enough

07:47.633 --> 07:48.958
to express themselves,
if they say,

07:49.051 --> 07:50.051
"Mom and Dad,
I don't want to go,"

07:50.211 --> 07:52.045
then we should respect that.

07:52.138 --> 07:53.630
- Okay, how many kids?

07:53.714 --> 07:54.973
- Okay, so I can't do three.

07:55.057 --> 07:56.558
Pretty firmly not three.
- Okay.

07:56.717 --> 07:57.809
- I'll be honest with you,

07:57.894 --> 07:58.727
I feel like whatever God
gives us.

07:58.886 --> 07:59.978
I don't want one,

08:00.062 --> 08:02.314
I want at least two,
I could do four.

08:02.473 --> 08:03.648
I don't know how I wanna bir--
- You could do one,

08:03.807 --> 08:05.642
maybe two, definitely
not three, could do four--

08:05.735 --> 08:07.152
So we're skipping
three no matter what.

08:07.311 --> 08:09.488
- Yeah,
no matter what, no three.

08:09.572 --> 08:11.981
- So we're gonna have
a lot of kids in our future?

08:12.074 --> 08:13.566

to have a big family.

08:13.659 --> 08:15.235
What about you?

08:15.328 --> 08:18.163
- I mean, whatever I can afford
and whatever God gives me.

08:18.247 --> 08:21.157
You don't get to say,
"I want to have twins."

08:21.250 --> 08:22.825
- That would be--oh, dude,

08:22.919 --> 08:24.336

And she is non-stop.

25:54.219 --> 25:58.055
She is just always stepping in
and it is distracting.

25:58.214 --> 26:00.048
This person who's been
a confidant

26:00.133 --> 26:01.141
and somebody he trusted in

26:01.226 --> 26:03.051

26:52.268 --> 26:53.352

26:53.436 --> 26:54.528
- A lot of [bleep]
in this water.

26:54.613 --> 26:56.438

26:59.108 --> 27:01.368
- I understood.
- [laughs]

27:02.779 --> 27:04.371
- Did you guys expect
to connect this fast

27:04.456 --> 27:05.706
in such a short amount of time?

27:05.790 --> 27:07.124
- No.
- No.

27:07.283 --> 27:09.701
- Mm-mm, I didn't.
I'm actually surprised.

27:09.794 --> 27:12.046
Like, it feels like
I've known him for a long time.

27:12.130 --> 27:14.039
So I think that makes it
easier for me.

27:14.132 --> 27:15.707
Are you guys seeing why
you're--why you're matched?

27:15.792 --> 27:16.958
- Yeah, I was about to ask that.

27:17.043 --> 27:18.126
That's so crazy.
- Why you were matched?

27:18.211 --> 27:20.545
Anything, like,
similarities or anything?

27:20.639 --> 27:22.881
- Yeah, we definitely have
a lot of things in common.

27:22.974 --> 27:24.383
- I think you guys look
great together, anyways.

27:24.476 --> 27:25.884
- I like you guys together.
- Yo, for real.

27:25.968 --> 27:27.219
Such a sexy couple.
- Thank you.

27:27.312 --> 27:29.137
- You guys look nice.
- For real, for real.

27:29.230 --> 27:30.481
- Yeah, I can definitely see

27:30.640 --> 27:32.808
why the experts
paired us together

27:32.901 --> 27:34.652
because we have
a lot of similarities.

27:34.811 --> 27:36.978
Our beliefs,
what we want in the marriage,

27:37.072 --> 27:38.647
what we want from a partner.

27:38.740 --> 27:40.407
So even, like,
the first day I was like,

27:40.492 --> 27:42.493
"It's not even
some things in common,

27:42.652 --> 27:45.237
it's, like,
all things in common."

27:45.330 --> 27:47.748
So I could definitely
see why they did that.

27:47.832 --> 27:49.833
- I think personality wise,
I think we're both, like,

27:49.918 --> 27:51.168
very, like, opinionated.

27:51.327 --> 27:52.327
- Mm.

27:52.412 --> 27:55.914
- Very, like, um,

27:56.007 --> 27:57.257
we speak with conviction

27:57.342 --> 27:59.593
when we feel like--
We believe something.

27:59.678 --> 28:01.261
So I feel like, in that regard,

28:01.421 --> 28:02.513
we're kind of the same as well.

28:02.672 --> 28:03.847
- Mm-hmm.
- You get what I'm saying?

28:04.006 --> 28:06.091
- Do you find, like,
it's a challenge

28:06.184 --> 28:09.344
with you guys are both
opinion--opinionated?

28:09.429 --> 28:11.930
- I don't know.
I feel like I'm able,

28:12.014 --> 28:13.524
sometimes, to see both sides,

28:13.683 --> 28:16.351
and sometimes
he's just like, "Nah.

28:16.436 --> 28:19.196
- [laughter]
- "Like, this is how it is,

28:19.355 --> 28:20.447
this is what you did,"
type of thing,

28:20.532 --> 28:23.024
and I'm like, "no, not even."

28:23.109 --> 28:25.035
- That's funny 'cause I think--
I could think

28:25.194 --> 28:27.121
the same about you.
- I'm sure you can.

28:27.205 --> 28:28.280
- I think we're the same
in that regard.

28:28.373 --> 28:30.457
<i>- Jasmina and Mike,</i>

28:30.542 --> 28:31.875

28:31.960 --> 28:34.369
<i>why they were matched
and their similarities.</i>

28:34.454 --> 28:36.130
<i>But, you know,
she just married a stranger</i>

28:36.214 --> 28:38.132
<i>so, um, it's just
gonna take time.</i>

28:38.216 --> 28:39.875
And it's just, like, you know,

28:39.959 --> 28:42.136
focusing on not trying
to get your point across,

28:42.220 --> 28:44.471
but just, like, being
understanding to each other,

28:44.556 --> 28:46.974
even if you have
opposite point of views.

28:47.133 --> 28:48.383
- I like to push my wife.

28:48.468 --> 28:49.309
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Like, I really do.

28:49.469 --> 28:50.644
She knows it, too.

28:50.729 --> 28:51.812
I told her, I was like,
"I don't know

28:51.896 --> 28:53.221
how you gonna live
like this forever."

28:53.306 --> 28:54.565
[laughter]
Like, we're riding the horse

28:54.649 --> 28:56.308
and my horse
is going kinda fast.

28:56.392 --> 28:58.152
But, like, I want to have,
like, that thrill

28:58.236 --> 28:59.486
so I can remember it too.
- Yup.

28:59.571 --> 29:01.655
- But at one point,
after we went, like--

29:01.814 --> 29:03.240
Shoot, we went--probably went
two miles with the horse,

29:03.399 --> 29:04.566
and then when
we were coming back,

29:04.659 --> 29:05.993
I could tell
she was at her peak.

29:06.152 --> 29:08.162
Like, "Yo, I'm not--
I'm not effing around no more."

29:08.246 --> 29:10.164
Like, "slow down, or I'ma hit--

29:10.248 --> 29:11.406
I'ma take care of you
when I get off this horse."

29:11.499 --> 29:13.167
- [laughs]
- And, like, I like that,

29:13.251 --> 29:14.585
you know, and--

29:14.744 --> 29:15.911
And then I slowed down,
you know?

29:15.995 --> 29:17.329
You can--you just feel it,
the energy.

29:17.422 --> 29:18.747
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- You'll feel the energy.

29:18.831 --> 29:20.007
- You definitely
want to, like, push her

29:20.091 --> 29:21.500
out of her comfort zone,
but you don't wanna

29:21.584 --> 29:23.084
push her too much.
- Yeah, to scare her,

29:23.169 --> 29:24.678
like, "I can't rock
with him anymore."

29:24.763 --> 29:26.087
Yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly.
- Right, right, right.

29:26.172 --> 29:27.931
- Like, "He's not listening
to me" kind of thing.

29:28.090 --> 29:30.267
- O is high energy,
O is aggressive,

29:30.351 --> 29:31.259
O is an alpha male.

29:31.352 --> 29:32.844
<i>That intensity, he's gonna</i>

29:32.937 --> 29:34.846
<i>put into his marriage
to push his wife.</i>

29:34.931 --> 29:36.264
So of course, it can be a pro

29:36.357 --> 29:37.941
because you're pushing
your spouse,

29:38.026 --> 29:40.194
<i>but also, if he doesn't,
you know, reel it in,</i>

29:40.353 --> 29:42.029
that can also be a con,

29:42.188 --> 29:44.281
so I can understand the
friction that they're having,

29:44.365 --> 29:45.866
but O is someone that

29:45.950 --> 29:48.109
<i>I know he knows
how to self-correct.</i>

29:48.194 --> 29:50.788
<i>So hopefully before
it gets to be too much,</i>

33:20.823 --> 33:23.992
it would take time

33:24.076 --> 33:25.660
- My whole life has
been an eruption, mainly,

33:25.745 --> 33:27.912
so I'm ready
to help you with yours.

<i>- Hey, how are you?
How's married life?</i>

34:01.030 --> 34:05.459
- It's not what I expected.

34:05.543 --> 34:08.545
So things haven't gone
the way I would've expected.

34:08.704 --> 34:11.372
<i>- Oh?</i>
- Yeah.

34:11.457 --> 34:15.627
She has some
sort of concerns about us

34:15.711 --> 34:16.887
and she doesn't wanna--
<i>- Okay.</i>

34:16.971 --> 34:18.213
- Talk about them.

34:18.297 --> 34:20.548
She's walked out
of a lot of conversations

34:20.633 --> 34:23.301
and gets really defensive

34:26.138 --> 34:27.981
any version of
"you didn't give it a chance."

34:28.066 --> 34:30.067
- I'm just sick of it, like--

34:30.151 --> 34:32.486
Like, I'm stuck in
a terrible situation

34:32.645 --> 34:34.237
that's absolutely miserable

34:34.322 --> 34:37.157
and I could be portrayed
in a very poor light here.

34:37.316 --> 34:40.660
And I'm sick of [bleep] crying.

34:40.745 --> 34:42.329
And I'm sick of being positive

34:42.413 --> 34:44.072
and trying to have a good day.

34:44.156 --> 34:45.665
And I'm sick of being
the good person

34:45.750 --> 34:47.334
and taking the high road

34:47.493 --> 34:49.419
when everyone's
just [bleep] on me.

34:51.580 --> 34:53.665
- And I asked, basically,
the crew,

34:53.749 --> 34:56.593
"Hey, if you want
to ask her to talk to me,

34:56.677 --> 34:58.095
like, in private,
I'm happy to do that."

35:01.006 --> 35:03.174
- No, I do not want
to talk to him.

35:03.259 --> 35:04.425
I hate him.

35:04.519 --> 35:06.186
He's a [bleep] ass[bleep].

35:06.345 --> 35:10.014
He's disrespectful, and rude,
and he's doing me dirty.

35:10.099 --> 35:12.275
And it's [bleep] disgusting

35:12.434 --> 35:14.519
that a man is
treating a woman like that

35:14.603 --> 35:16.071
who's been
nothing but nice to him.

35:18.691 --> 35:19.616
- And it's essentially that

35:19.775 --> 35:21.693
she doesn't think
we're compatible.

35:21.786 --> 35:24.612
She feels robbed because

35:24.697 --> 35:26.447
she didn't get
the person she wanted.

35:26.541 --> 35:28.283
- He comes off as this good guy.

35:28.367 --> 35:29.626
Well, guess what?

35:29.785 --> 35:32.796
He's a [bleep] car salesman
who sells houses.

35:32.880 --> 35:35.456
Why does he think he can
move into the apartment

35:35.541 --> 35:37.801
and I don't get to move
into the apartment?

35:37.960 --> 35:40.387
Why can't I hang out
with my girls?

35:40.546 --> 35:41.930
Why don't I get to be there?

35:45.309 --> 35:48.720
<i>- She--she doesn't know if
she got the person she wanted</i>

35:48.804 --> 35:49.729
<i>because she doesn't even--</i>

35:51.974 --> 35:56.153
- Yeah, nobody gets the person
that they 100% want

35:56.312 --> 35:57.904
'cause that person
doesn't exist.

35:57.989 --> 35:59.230
<i>- You know, it's funny, too,
'cause when we were</i>

35:59.323 --> 36:00.815
<i>talking to her mom,</i>

36:00.900 --> 36:02.984
<i>and Mom was telling her about</i>

36:03.068 --> 36:04.986
<i>how you are very down to earth,</i>

36:05.070 --> 36:06.997
<i>and you don't raise your voice,</i>

36:07.156 --> 36:09.157
<i>and you're able
to have conversations.</i>

36:09.241 --> 36:12.252
<i>And her mom was saying that
that's exactly what she needs</i>

36:12.411 --> 36:14.087
<i>because she flies
off the handle,</i>

36:14.172 --> 36:15.839
<i>and she cries all the time,</i>

36:15.923 --> 36:18.917
<i>and she needs someone that's
gonna bring her down to earth.</i>

36:19.001 --> 36:24.097
- That's the same message
I got from Mom and Dad,

36:24.256 --> 36:25.590
and from her bridesmaids,

36:25.674 --> 36:27.851
like, "We think
you're perfect for her.

36:27.935 --> 36:29.352
She needs a guy like you."

36:29.437 --> 36:31.771
- The only time
I'm happy here is if--

36:31.931 --> 36:35.767
If I'm with one of the girls,
or I'm sitting by myself.

36:35.851 --> 36:38.853
I'm not being portrayed
in a good light

36:38.938 --> 36:40.864
and my mom is very upset.

36:41.023 --> 36:44.108
She's mad because she thinks
I'm not being nice to Chris.

36:44.193 --> 36:45.860
And I am being nice to him.

36:45.945 --> 36:47.362
I'm a good person

36:47.455 --> 36:49.280
and if I don't come off
that way on this show,

36:49.365 --> 36:52.116
I'm gonna be [bleep] pissed.

36:52.210 --> 36:54.619
- At the end of the day,
it is a show about marriage.

not "Single at First Sight."

'Cause if you're not a couple,
you're not a couple,

36:58.540 --> 36:59.466

<i>- Like, I feel like</i>

37:01.543 --> 37:05.138

dug her feet in this far</i>

37:05.223 --> 37:09.050
<i>and is not willing

37:09.134 --> 37:12.646
<i>or even have a conversation
for crying out loud,</i>

37:12.730 --> 37:16.724
<i>I think you should
just cut your loss.</i>

37:16.809 --> 37:20.144

about at that point so...

37:26.819 --> 37:28.495

39:27.689 --> 39:29.107
- Hey, girl, hey.
- Hi, how are ya?

39:29.200 --> 39:30.784
Did you just "hey, girl" me?
- Yeah, I did.

39:30.868 --> 39:32.535
- Thank you.

39:32.694 --> 39:34.612

I wanna sit right here.

39:39.868 --> 39:40.785
- I'm doing.
- Yeah?

39:40.869 --> 39:42.295
- Yeah?
- I'm doing.

39:42.380 --> 39:43.963
- You look like you're in
a significantly better place

39:44.048 --> 39:45.882
today than you were
the first day I met you.

39:45.966 --> 39:47.384
- The--the first couple of days.

39:47.468 --> 39:49.043
- Yeah.
- Uh...

39:49.128 --> 39:52.222
Yeah, it's, um,

39:52.306 --> 39:54.182
it's not where I thought I'd be.

39:55.551 --> 39:56.551
- Like, what have--
What have you been thinking

39:56.635 --> 39:58.895
these past couple of days
being here?

39:58.979 --> 40:01.639
- Yeah, I mean,
I think it's definitely hard.

40:01.732 --> 40:03.558
You know, like, I'm so happy
for everyone,

40:03.651 --> 40:04.984
like, that everyone's happy.

40:05.069 --> 40:06.811
But, like, it's definitely hard

40:06.895 --> 40:08.655
to, like, be around it

40:08.739 --> 40:12.158
and like, know that,
like, I don't have that.

40:14.245 --> 40:15.578
- What happened?

40:15.737 --> 40:17.580
- Wedding is great.
At least I think it's great.

40:17.665 --> 40:19.240
- Okay, no arguments?

40:19.324 --> 40:22.243
- No, not during the wedding,
no disagreements.

40:22.327 --> 40:23.411
But then late that night,

40:23.495 --> 40:26.747
she eventually comes out
and says, um,

40:26.832 --> 40:28.499
"I have some concerns."

40:28.584 --> 40:31.928
And I said,
"Well, like, what happened?

40:32.012 --> 40:33.504
Can I clarify anything?"

40:33.589 --> 40:34.755
And she said,
"Well, it's been a long day,

40:34.840 --> 40:35.840
we're both really tired."

40:35.924 --> 40:37.267
So the next morning,

40:37.426 --> 40:38.852
we sit down
and I'm trying to figure out,

40:39.011 --> 40:42.605
do I have to fix something,
change something, adjust?

40:42.764 --> 40:45.525
But she's basically like,
"Nope, we're not--

40:45.609 --> 40:47.435
"I just don't think
we're compatible,

40:47.519 --> 40:49.020
there are too many
values differences."

40:49.113 --> 40:51.189
- The next morning?
- Literally the next morning.

40:51.282 --> 40:54.942
We've literally never had more
than a super--

40:55.035 --> 40:57.203
Like, "What's your last name?"
- Right.

40:57.288 --> 40:58.538
- "What do you do for work?"
- Yeah.

40:58.622 --> 40:59.947
- These are
the conversations you--

41:00.040 --> 41:01.449
Remember your
first conversation?

41:01.533 --> 41:04.127
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, I'm just so confused.

41:04.286 --> 41:07.046
- Obviously,
neither Chris or I, like,

41:07.131 --> 41:09.466
thought this was
gonna be our situation.

41:09.550 --> 41:11.718
I think what's tough

41:11.877 --> 41:15.379
is I'm not blaming him,

41:15.473 --> 41:20.310
but I feel like he's, like,
blaming me kind of, and

41:20.469 --> 41:22.553
that's, like,
so upsetting to me.

41:22.646 --> 41:24.230
- It sounds like she didn't
even give you a chance.

41:24.315 --> 41:25.815
Like, she had this vision
in her head

41:25.974 --> 41:27.391
and when she saw you
at the end of the aisle,

41:27.476 --> 41:29.986
you didn't fit that vision,
physically,

41:30.070 --> 41:31.646
and she instantly wrote you off.

41:31.739 --> 41:33.823
- And she's never
said anything physical

41:33.908 --> 41:35.650
either direction so I've
never heard her say like--

41:35.734 --> 41:36.576
- 'Cause you're
a good looking dude.

41:36.660 --> 41:37.827
- Yeah!
- I appreciate that.

41:37.986 --> 41:38.995
- You're a stud.
- She's never been like,

41:39.079 --> 41:40.163
"No, no, no, you're attractive--

41:40.322 --> 41:42.081
- Simmer down.
- "But other stuff."

41:42.166 --> 41:43.741
But she's also never been like,

41:43.825 --> 41:45.076
"Oh, no, no, no, you're a good
guy, I'm just not attract--"

41:45.160 --> 41:46.160
She's never said either,

41:46.253 --> 41:48.246
so that I honestly don't know.

41:48.339 --> 41:49.672
If it's that,

41:49.757 --> 41:53.084
maybe she's trying
to just not say that, but...

41:53.168 --> 41:54.585
- You know, I came into this

41:54.670 --> 41:55.920
and put in all the same efforts

41:56.013 --> 41:59.173
as everyone else, right?

41:59.258 --> 42:00.508
- So you feel like
you've done everything

42:00.592 --> 42:02.352
to try to make it work?

42:02.511 --> 42:04.521
- Well, I mean,
here's the thing.

42:04.605 --> 42:07.431
Did I--did I come into this
to find a husband?

42:07.516 --> 42:09.025
100%.

42:09.109 --> 42:10.351
That wedding night,

42:10.435 --> 42:12.353
I started talking
to friends of his, right?

42:12.437 --> 42:14.355
And family of his,
they were telling me, right?

- Yeah.

44:27.247 --> 44:29.407

why you probably threw in
the towel so quickly?

44:33.837 --> 44:36.247

if I'm wrong.

44:46.183 --> 44:47.842
I think you're not physically
attracted to him

there's anything wrong

normally be attracted to?

45:01.690 --> 45:02.699
Yes.

Did I feel like what I asked for

No.

45:08.205 --> 45:10.948

them told me, like,

45:11.032 --> 45:13.367
"We don't think
we have a match for you,"

that doesn't align,

45:15.879 --> 45:17.964

45:18.123 --> 45:19.215

45:19.374 --> 45:21.375
I think you just need
to tell him

45:21.460 --> 45:24.220
straightforward and bluntly,
this is what it is,

45:24.304 --> 45:27.724
because it could be that maybe
you think that you told him,

45:27.808 --> 45:30.226
and maybe 'cause you don't want
to hurt his feelings,

45:30.310 --> 45:31.811
you probably
beat around the bush

45:31.895 --> 45:34.897

if I will get there,</i>

51:27.992 --> 51:30.494

I'm always gonna like it,

51:38.762 --> 51:42.765
but I have to complain
about it first to be dramatic.

51:42.849 --> 51:44.266
But in the end,
it's all worth it.

51:47.011 --> 51:49.105

Mark and I are gonna have
dinner with all the couples

52:04.529 --> 52:07.781

- What'd you get for a drink?

52:34.651 --> 52:36.318

52:43.743 --> 52:45.244
- Are we the last?
- I think so, yeah.

52:45.328 --> 52:46.820
- Look at those two beauties.
- Hi, guys.

52:46.913 --> 52:48.405
- They look like Easter delight.

52:48.498 --> 52:49.582
- They really do.

52:49.666 --> 52:51.074
<i>- ♪ Live it up ♪</i>

52:51.159 --> 52:54.244

and progressing as a couple.

52:56.590 --> 52:57.915
- You guys want
to get a bite to eat?

52:58.008 --> 52:59.675
- Ooh, yes, I'm starving.
- All right, let's go.

52:59.759 --> 53:01.844
- I'm just hoping for the best
and hoping we'll have fun,

53:01.928 --> 53:03.429
but there's been tension

53:03.513 --> 53:04.680
since the beginning
of this honeymoon.

53:04.764 --> 53:06.924
But hopefully,

53:07.008 --> 53:09.518
I mean, I think that's all been
squashed at this point.

53:09.677 --> 53:12.938
- Look at this
nice family style table.

53:13.023 --> 53:15.098
What a nice view.

53:15.192 --> 53:16.609
- Are you guys excited
to get back to the real world?

53:16.693 --> 53:18.435
- I am. I miss my job.

53:18.519 --> 53:20.446
I miss, just, my every day,
like, routine.

53:20.605 --> 53:21.780
- Girl, what do you do?

53:21.865 --> 53:23.199
I was trying to think about
that last night.

53:23.283 --> 53:25.275
- Teach toddlers.
- Wow.

53:25.368 --> 53:27.361
- That's right.
I was like, I can't remember.

53:27.454 --> 53:28.528
- You definitely
gotta have some babies.

53:28.622 --> 53:29.872
- You're gonna be fine, girl.

53:30.031 --> 53:31.207
- If we had to guess
which couple's gonna

53:31.291 --> 53:32.282
have kids first,
who would we guess?

53:32.375 --> 53:33.450
[laughing]

53:33.534 --> 53:36.370
- Them two?
- For sure.

53:36.454 --> 53:38.372
- I think it's either you guys
on purpose or them by accident.

53:38.456 --> 53:39.381
- I agree--

53:39.466 --> 53:41.800
I agree. I 100% agree!

53:41.885 --> 53:43.627
- Does everybody
want kids in general?

53:43.711 --> 53:45.879
- Yeah, well, I do.
- How many?

53:45.972 --> 53:47.047
- Raise your hand
if you want kids.

53:47.131 --> 53:48.641
- I would like three--
- But, like, one.

53:48.800 --> 53:51.134
- I would settle for two,

53:51.228 --> 53:53.804
the third could be the bonus,
but two at least.

53:53.897 --> 53:55.973
- So two and a possible.

53:56.066 --> 53:57.149
- So how many kids do you want?
You said two?

53:57.234 --> 53:58.725
- Three.

53:58.810 --> 53:59.985
- I heard someone over
there say two and a maybe,

54:00.070 --> 54:01.403
right, I kinda like that,
like that's--

54:01.488 --> 54:03.239
- Two and a possible.
- Two and a possible, yeah.

54:03.398 --> 54:04.740
- Three--three, no,
we're having three.

54:04.824 --> 54:09.152
- So--so Noi--Noi is dead set
on three.

54:09.246 --> 54:10.496
- I don't think you guys
will know whether or not you

54:10.655 --> 54:12.248
want to have a third
until you have the first two.

54:12.332 --> 54:13.666
- Yeah.
- You're gonna--

54:13.750 --> 54:15.334
[laughs]

54:15.418 --> 54:16.910
- I didn't really want
to have kids at all

54:17.003 --> 54:20.589
until the last few years.
I was very like,

54:20.748 --> 54:22.341
don't want to get married,
don't have kids,

54:22.425 --> 54:24.426
just gonna live, and have fun,

54:24.585 --> 54:27.504
and travel,
and do whatever I want.

54:27.597 --> 54:29.848
But I realized,
maybe five years ago or so,

54:29.933 --> 54:32.592
that once the rest of my life
started to fall into place,

54:32.686 --> 54:35.595
my career, my mental health,

54:35.680 --> 54:37.931
my confidence, like,
everything fell into place,

54:38.024 --> 54:39.608
that I realized that I think,

54:39.767 --> 54:41.852
now I feel comfortable
having a kid.

54:41.936 --> 54:43.028
- You're gonna be
a great dad one day, Chris.

54:43.187 --> 54:44.688
- Thank you.
- Yeah, you will.

54:44.772 --> 54:46.189
- Great husband and great dad.
You got some good values.

54:46.274 --> 54:47.616
- You think you could babysit
my third kid just in case?

54:47.701 --> 54:50.527
[laughter]

54:50.620 --> 54:52.612
- Has anyone had any, like,
bumps in your marriage

54:52.697 --> 54:53.956
that you, like,
had to, like, work through?

54:54.115 --> 54:55.291
Whether it was,
like, communication

54:55.450 --> 54:57.626
or just anything
throughout this week?

55:03.374 --> 55:06.460
- We've been having an issue
with my communication style.

55:06.544 --> 55:08.387
Because if I'm telling my wife,

55:08.471 --> 55:10.139
what you're doing is hurting me,

55:10.298 --> 55:11.965
there's a way to deliver
that message

55:12.058 --> 55:14.310
that doesn't sound so--
- Harsh.

55:14.469 --> 55:15.227
- Just aggressive,
you know what I mean?

55:15.312 --> 55:17.396
So I'm still learning

55:17.480 --> 55:20.557
how to convey messages in a way
that's beneficial,

55:20.641 --> 55:22.067
and doesn't create
a bigger issue

55:22.152 --> 55:23.485
because of how I said something.

55:23.570 --> 55:24.903
- Self-awareness is key.

55:24.988 --> 55:27.564
So the fact that you know
and you said that,

55:27.657 --> 55:29.149
that is step one.

55:29.233 --> 55:31.744
'Cause some people,
they can't even acknowledge it.

55:31.828 --> 55:33.153
Or they'll be like,
"What are you talking about?"

55:33.246 --> 55:34.830
And that creates
a bigger problem.

55:34.989 --> 55:36.573
- And even the effort too,
you know?

55:36.666 --> 55:38.167
Like, if you're actively
trying, you might not always

55:38.251 --> 55:39.409
get the words right,
but it's like,

55:39.494 --> 55:41.587
I'm doing my best here,
you know?

55:41.746 --> 55:43.005
- I learned that I gotta--

55:43.089 --> 55:45.758
It's not just "I,"
there's a "we."

55:45.842 --> 55:48.510
And I can't keep pushing
my wife to the limit

55:48.595 --> 55:52.506
on every excursion and
everything I do in my life.

55:52.590 --> 55:55.092
I'm just a energized person,

55:55.176 --> 55:57.269
but not everybody's like that

55:57.354 --> 55:59.355
and I have to learn
to have more patience

55:59.439 --> 56:01.023
and hear what
she's saying until--

56:01.107 --> 56:04.684
Before she starts getting real
serious, trying to check me.

56:04.769 --> 56:05.852
Even though--
It's good, it's cool.

56:05.945 --> 56:08.021
But I need that in my life.

56:08.106 --> 56:10.440
I would roll over somebody
if they were just passive.

56:10.525 --> 56:12.943
So I'm very thankful.
- You sure would 'cause...

56:13.027 --> 56:15.037
whoo!

56:15.121 --> 56:16.696
[laughter]

56:16.790 --> 56:19.866
I like it.
- Love you so much.

56:19.951 --> 56:21.368
<i>- O and Katina,</i>

56:21.452 --> 56:23.453
even though they communicate
on different levels,

56:23.538 --> 56:25.455
<i>they balance each other out.</i>

56:25.540 --> 56:26.623
<i>You know,
sometimes he can be a lot.</i>

56:26.707 --> 56:28.050
She'll reel him in.

56:28.134 --> 56:30.219
Sometimes she can be dramatic,
he'll reel her in.

56:30.303 --> 56:32.212
I think it's a very
great balance,

56:32.296 --> 56:35.057
- Steve expresses himself
very differently from me.

56:35.216 --> 56:36.800
He's very analytical,
he's very logical,

56:36.893 --> 56:38.143
he's a realist.

56:38.228 --> 56:40.229
So for me,
I had to recognize that, like,

56:40.313 --> 56:41.805
just because he's not

56:41.889 --> 56:43.899
reflecting what I'm saying
to him right away,

56:44.058 --> 56:46.059
it doesn't mean
that he's not feeling it.

56:46.144 --> 56:48.237
- We had a tough conversation
when she was asking me

56:48.321 --> 56:50.814
how I felt, but I was like,
"You know how I feel.

56:50.907 --> 56:53.409
You know, between how I look
at you, how I touch you."

56:53.493 --> 56:54.827
We cuddle a lot.

56:54.911 --> 56:57.904
We embrace, we hug,
you know, we hold hands.

56:57.989 --> 56:59.573
And for me, that's one of--

56:59.666 --> 57:00.824
You know, that's one of the ways

57:00.908 --> 57:03.085
that I communicate
how I feel, for sure.

57:03.244 --> 57:04.995
How--you know,
the way we interact.

57:05.079 --> 57:06.755
So I think that
was reassuring for her,

57:06.840 --> 57:09.499
even though I couldn't give her
the verbal affirmation

57:09.584 --> 57:12.428
she was looking for,
but I'm learning to do that.

57:12.512 --> 57:14.421
- I think for me,
it's just, like,

57:14.514 --> 57:16.173
allowing my wife to help me

57:16.266 --> 57:18.934
in things that I'm used
to doing for myself.

57:19.093 --> 57:20.677
And I've never had,
like, a situation

57:20.761 --> 57:23.021
where I had so much support
out the gate.

57:23.106 --> 57:25.015
All: Aw!

57:25.099 --> 57:26.433
- You look like a happy--

57:26.526 --> 57:28.777
I knew I'd seen
a glow on you earlier.

57:28.936 --> 57:30.353
- Look at Lindsey getting red!
Look at her!

57:30.447 --> 57:31.938
[cheering]

57:32.031 --> 57:33.615
- It's a sunburn!
It's a sunburn.

57:33.700 --> 57:36.368
- It's a sunburn.
- And the passion.

57:36.453 --> 57:37.619
- What about you guys?

57:37.778 --> 57:38.954
- Anything?

57:42.208 --> 57:43.366
- Don't look at me.
[laughter]

57:43.460 --> 57:45.043
- Yeah, yeah, your turn.

57:45.203 --> 57:49.882
- Yeah, we're good.

57:50.041 --> 57:52.050
- Uh, oh, I think we know that
we're not in the same place

57:52.135 --> 57:53.460
that you guys all are

57:53.553 --> 57:58.223
so we've certainly had bumps.

57:58.308 --> 58:01.059
- I think we're taking it
day by day

58:01.144 --> 58:02.478
as it comes at us

58:02.562 --> 58:05.397
and, you know, we're both
still sitting here so...

58:05.482 --> 58:06.732
- That's great.

58:06.816 --> 58:08.141
- I think that
says everything, right?

58:08.226 --> 58:10.152
- We're still
figuring out the plan.

58:11.812 --> 58:14.731
<i>Alyssa and I don't talk
outside of</i>

58:14.815 --> 58:17.734
<i>when we are doing
an activity together.</i>

58:17.818 --> 58:19.912
<i>And I'm trying
to push as hard as I can,</i>

58:19.996 --> 58:21.747
while giving her
the space to grow

58:21.831 --> 58:23.490
because everybody
has always told me

58:23.574 --> 58:25.659
<i>that she moves incredibly
slowly.</i>

58:25.752 --> 58:27.169
But if I'm not in this at all,

58:27.328 --> 58:28.495
then I'm done
and I want to move on,

58:28.588 --> 58:29.838
and I want her to say out loud

58:29.923 --> 58:32.082
on camera to everybody
that we are done.

58:32.166 --> 58:34.334
<i>- ♪ I can't move mountains ♪</i>

58:34.427 --> 58:36.169
- So it sounds
like everyone else

58:36.254 --> 58:38.255
is gonna be moving in together,

58:38.339 --> 58:40.840
and sharing an apartment,
and continuing on this journey.

58:40.934 --> 58:42.759
So I'm just curious, you know,

58:42.843 --> 58:46.271
what your plans are for that?

58:46.356 --> 58:51.610
- So we haven't had a chance
to talk about it yet,

58:51.694 --> 58:56.198
but my thought was that you
could move into the apartment

58:56.282 --> 58:58.283
for the first half

58:58.368 --> 59:01.111
and then I could move in
in the second half.

59:01.204 --> 59:03.196
Because I know we both
want to be a part of it

59:03.281 --> 59:05.624
'cause I know I love you all
so much

59:05.783 --> 59:11.463
and just because it didn't
work out in a romantic sense,

59:11.548 --> 59:13.882
that doesn't mean that

59:14.041 --> 59:16.385
we shouldn't be able to
participate

59:16.469 --> 59:18.878
when we're both
still sitting here and

59:18.963 --> 59:22.382
want to do that, in my opinion.

59:22.466 --> 59:25.477

59:56.917 --> 1:00:00.012
<i>♪ ♪</i>

1:00:04.017 --> 1:00:06.426
- So my thought was that

1:00:06.519 --> 1:00:08.437
you could move into
the apartment

1:00:08.521 --> 1:00:10.355
for the first half

1:00:10.440 --> 1:00:12.608
and then I could move in
in the second half.

1:00:12.692 --> 1:00:18.438
- I had not heard that strategy.

1:00:18.531 --> 1:00:21.033
That's not something
I'm interested in.

1:00:21.117 --> 1:00:22.451
I love all of you.

1:00:22.535 --> 1:00:23.860
I didn't come here for you guys.

1:00:23.953 --> 1:00:28.707
I am either all in or all out.

1:00:30.034 --> 1:00:32.035
I'm not looking
to split time with you

1:00:32.119 --> 1:00:36.122
like [bleep] divorced parents.

1:00:36.207 --> 1:00:38.541
The notion that we would
share this experience

1:00:38.635 --> 1:00:40.218
like divorced parents,

1:00:40.303 --> 1:00:41.878
<i>deciding which weekend days</i>

1:00:41.962 --> 1:00:43.055
<i>we were going to spend
with our children,</i>

1:00:43.214 --> 1:00:45.140
our children being
the other couples,

1:00:45.299 --> 1:00:46.800
<i>is absurd.</i>

1:00:46.884 --> 1:00:49.636
We're not picking weekends.
This isn't a draft.

1:00:49.729 --> 1:00:51.563
<i>At this point,
I believe she is continuing</i>

1:00:51.648 --> 1:00:52.972
<i>through this process because</i>

1:00:53.066 --> 1:00:54.641
<i>she wants to live in
the apartment building,</i>

1:00:54.725 --> 1:00:56.985
not because of anything
having anything to do

1:00:57.070 --> 1:00:58.561
with our marriage.

1:00:58.655 --> 1:01:00.563
My drive

1:01:00.648 --> 1:01:03.483
is to find the person I'm gonna
spend the rest of my life with.

1:01:03.567 --> 1:01:08.163
And if somebody wants to move
exceptionally slowly,

1:01:08.322 --> 1:01:09.656
that's fine with me,

1:01:09.749 --> 1:01:12.826
because my plan
was a "rest of my life" plan.

1:01:12.910 --> 1:01:15.078
I have time.

1:01:15.171 --> 1:01:19.091
But I can't take those steps,

1:01:19.250 --> 1:01:24.003
I can't keep
putting myself out there,

1:01:24.088 --> 1:01:28.925
unless I get
something that's not zero back.

1:01:29.018 --> 1:01:30.268
- I like that.

1:01:33.597 --> 1:01:36.441
<i>- Him saying I'm not trying
isn't true.</i>

1:01:36.526 --> 1:01:39.436
For him not
to want to compromise,

1:01:39.529 --> 1:01:41.613
<i>you know, when I'm trying
to think of solutions</i>

1:01:41.698 --> 1:01:43.523
to these problems
that we're having,

1:01:43.616 --> 1:01:46.276
and he doesn't want
to entertain them,

1:01:46.360 --> 1:01:47.619
<i>you know,
that's disappointing to me</i>

1:01:47.778 --> 1:01:50.864
because Chris seems to be

1:01:50.948 --> 1:01:54.367
trying actively
to make me look bad.

1:01:54.452 --> 1:01:57.796
And it won't happen
because I'm not a bad person

1:01:57.880 --> 1:02:01.216
and I'm a really
[bleep] good person.

1:02:01.300 --> 1:02:03.209
- I know how I handle it

1:02:03.294 --> 1:02:06.972
is going to be based on
what you want to do.

1:02:07.056 --> 1:02:10.809
And if you are all out,
then so am I.

1:02:10.968 --> 1:02:15.230
If you are even 1% in,
then I'm all in.

1:02:18.484 --> 1:02:22.487
- Um, it's been
a tough journey for me

1:02:22.572 --> 1:02:24.990
and, you know,
I know it's a tough journey

1:02:25.074 --> 1:02:27.492
for you also,
and I'm not saying it's not,

1:02:27.577 --> 1:02:29.161
I just don't
want to speak for you.

1:02:29.245 --> 1:02:34.249
Um, and I just--
I want everyone to remember,

1:02:34.333 --> 1:02:36.075
including us, that,

1:02:36.160 --> 1:02:38.920
like, it's not my fault
that this happened.

1:02:39.079 --> 1:02:42.007
And, um, please don't do that,
Lindsey, while I'm talking.

1:02:42.166 --> 1:02:45.010
- I'm not doing anything.

1:02:46.846 --> 1:02:48.421
- I just want everyone
to remember that, like,

1:02:48.506 --> 1:02:51.591
I came in this
with the best intentions,

1:02:51.675 --> 1:02:53.676
as everyone else did,
and put in all the work

1:02:53.761 --> 1:02:55.178
like everyone else did.

1:02:55.262 --> 1:02:57.347
I feel happy
that I can say that,

1:02:57.431 --> 1:02:59.349
but just know that it hurts

1:02:59.433 --> 1:03:03.111
that this happened
this way for me.

1:03:03.196 --> 1:03:06.198
<i>- Everything that
Alyssa says out of her mouth</i>

1:03:06.357 --> 1:03:09.442
is so ingenuine and fake.

1:03:09.535 --> 1:03:11.953
<i>All I can do is
stare at a palm tree</i>

1:03:12.038 --> 1:03:14.206
or sand in the distance 'cause
I don't have a poker face

1:03:14.365 --> 1:03:17.450
and I just want
to call bull[bleep].

1:03:17.535 --> 1:03:21.963
- [voice breaking]
This hasn't been easy for me.

1:03:22.048 --> 1:03:24.090
And, um...

1:03:27.211 --> 1:03:30.547
- It's okay--it's okay.

1:03:30.631 --> 1:03:34.634
- We understand. It's okay.

1:03:34.718 --> 1:03:38.555
- All talk aside,
I just need to know

1:03:38.639 --> 1:03:41.474
if you are all out.

1:03:41.559 --> 1:03:42.901
That's it.

1:03:42.985 --> 1:03:46.571
It's the only question I have.

1:03:46.656 --> 1:03:48.648
- Do you understand
what he's saying to you?

1:03:48.732 --> 1:03:51.243
- Mm-hmm, but I think
it's not a conversation...

1:03:51.327 --> 1:03:53.486
- In front of everybody,
yeah, exactly.

1:03:53.571 --> 1:03:55.238
- Never is.

1:03:55.331 --> 1:03:57.415
- Well, I think you have to
also respect her decision

1:03:57.500 --> 1:03:58.658
if she doesn't want
to talk about

1:03:58.742 --> 1:04:00.001
personal things
in front of people.

1:04:00.086 --> 1:04:02.504
- Yeah, that's what it is.
- So if--

1:04:02.663 --> 1:04:04.747
You guys do owe each other
a conversation.

1:04:04.841 --> 1:04:06.499
- Absolutely, you do.
- Which I think should have,

1:04:06.592 --> 1:04:08.167
you know,
I know you have questions

1:04:08.252 --> 1:04:09.752
that you want answered.

1:04:09.846 --> 1:04:12.264
And I had a conversation
with Alyssa earlier

1:04:12.348 --> 1:04:13.840
and she's willing
to sit down with you

1:04:13.933 --> 1:04:15.934
and answer every question
that you have.

1:04:16.018 --> 1:04:18.177
And I feel like once you guys
have that conversation,

1:04:18.262 --> 1:04:20.188
you would know how to move
going forward.

1:04:20.273 --> 1:04:22.357
But I also do agree
that it's not our business.

1:04:22.441 --> 1:04:24.517
And that you don't need to
speak about it in front of us.

1:04:24.602 --> 1:04:25.944
- Yeah.

1:04:26.028 --> 1:04:28.104
<i>- I put myself
in Chris's shoes--</i>

1:04:28.188 --> 1:04:29.698
My whole honeymoon,
I haven't had an answer.

1:04:29.782 --> 1:04:31.032
<i>Oh, well, you know,</i>

1:04:31.191 --> 1:04:32.609
<i>there's things
that I can't talk about,</i>

1:04:32.702 --> 1:04:34.360
<i>and this and that--
Those are excuses.</i>

1:04:34.445 --> 1:04:36.446
<i>I feel so bad for the man.</i>

1:04:36.530 --> 1:04:40.458
His heart is so big, though,
that he's hoping for that 1%

1:04:40.618 --> 1:04:42.785
so he could give his 100 still.

1:04:42.870 --> 1:04:44.713
- Either someone's trying
or they're not.

1:04:44.872 --> 1:04:47.290
- I know, but that's
not fair to say, though,

1:04:47.374 --> 1:04:48.958
'cause I'm still sitting here
with everyone,

1:04:49.043 --> 1:04:51.044
including you next to me.

1:04:51.128 --> 1:04:52.879
And so you can't say
that I'm not trying

1:04:52.963 --> 1:04:54.714
because I'm still here.

1:04:54.798 --> 1:04:58.384
And I had many chances
to leave, and I didn't.

1:04:58.469 --> 1:04:59.811
- Okay.

1:04:59.896 --> 1:05:04.232
Does that mean
that you're trying to decide

1:05:04.317 --> 1:05:06.559
whether or not to try?

1:05:06.652 --> 1:05:08.561
- Well, I think I've said it,

1:05:08.654 --> 1:05:10.739
that I'm not gonna talk
about that right now.

1:05:10.823 --> 1:05:12.908
And I think
I would appreciate it

1:05:12.992 --> 1:05:15.902
if you could respect that
'cause we're in a huge group.

1:05:15.986 --> 1:05:18.404
And like I said,
that's not something I can just

1:05:18.489 --> 1:05:23.251
sit here and say, like,
yes or no to right now.

1:05:23.336 --> 1:05:24.827
<i>- I mean, you could've
flown out yesterday,</i>

1:05:24.921 --> 1:05:27.330
but what is Boston's
temperature right now

1:05:27.414 --> 1:05:29.666
60 degrees?
We're in 90 degrees,

1:05:29.759 --> 1:05:31.176
so let's be real.

1:05:31.260 --> 1:05:33.261
<i>That was a bull[bleep] answer,</i>

1:05:33.346 --> 1:05:35.838
but if it makes her feel good
to go to sleep at night

1:05:35.932 --> 1:05:38.016
that she thinks she has given
even half the effort,

1:05:38.100 --> 1:05:40.435
or a quarter,
or even a piece of what--

1:05:40.519 --> 1:05:43.772
I can't talk other couples,
but what I've done for my wife

1:05:43.856 --> 1:05:45.273
to make her smile,

1:05:45.432 --> 1:05:47.525
she's out her mind.

1:05:49.946 --> 1:05:51.947
- Just because
this isn't working out

1:05:52.031 --> 1:05:54.357
like we both wanted it to,

1:05:54.441 --> 1:05:58.286
doesn't mean
that I'm not trying.

1:05:58.371 --> 1:06:01.280
And to me that says a lot.

1:06:01.374 --> 1:06:03.375
<i>- I don't know
what's going on with Alyssa.</i>

1:06:03.459 --> 1:06:04.534
<i>I don't even think Alyssa knows</i>

1:06:04.618 --> 1:06:05.868
<i>what's going on with Alyssa.</i>

1:06:05.962 --> 1:06:07.462
She keeps making it about her

1:06:07.621 --> 1:06:10.215
and how she got robbed,
but like, what about him?

1:06:10.374 --> 1:06:11.883
<i>Alyssa's not giving Chris
a chance</i>

1:06:12.042 --> 1:06:13.626
and he really got robbed.

1:06:13.711 --> 1:06:16.546
He got the shortest end
of the stick, chick.

1:06:16.639 --> 1:06:19.641
- You okay, Chris. Yeah?

1:06:19.725 --> 1:06:21.551
- I still don't know

1:06:21.635 --> 1:06:24.145
if I'm supposed to be moving on.

1:06:24.230 --> 1:06:27.565
A lack of an answer
means, to me,

1:06:27.725 --> 1:06:31.060
that I can't bet my house
on the idea

1:06:31.145 --> 1:06:32.904
that you are out of it.

1:06:32.989 --> 1:06:35.490
So by not knowing, the only way

1:06:35.574 --> 1:06:39.995
I can feel good about it myself
is to continue to try.

1:06:40.154 --> 1:06:43.081
You picture a lot of different
scenarios coming into this.

1:06:45.325 --> 1:06:47.085
Well, this wasn't one of them.

1:06:47.169 --> 1:06:48.745
- It's a very unfortunate
situation.

1:06:48.829 --> 1:06:50.163
- It is.

1:07:10.517 --> 1:07:14.779
- I'm just proud of you because
I think during the dinner,

1:07:14.938 --> 1:07:16.522
some of the conversations

1:07:16.615 --> 1:07:18.608
between Chris and Alyssa
were tough.

1:07:18.692 --> 1:07:20.118
And I'm so proud that
you didn't jump in

1:07:20.202 --> 1:07:21.611
when she said your name.

1:07:21.704 --> 1:07:24.447
- Like, it's not my fault
that this happened.

1:07:24.531 --> 1:07:27.950
And, um--please don't do that,
Lindsey, while I'm talking.

1:07:28.035 --> 1:07:30.286
- I'm not doing anything.
- Okay.

1:07:30.370 --> 1:07:32.464
- 'Cause at the end of the day,
like, this is us.

1:07:32.623 --> 1:07:35.467
So if you say something
that I feel I would never say,

1:07:35.551 --> 1:07:37.960
it affects me if you say it
because we're a team.

1:07:38.045 --> 1:07:39.387
So I was glad that
you didn't say anything

1:07:39.546 --> 1:07:41.464
and you just
kind of were silent.

1:07:41.548 --> 1:07:43.216
I was like, that's great,
that's perfect.

1:07:43.309 --> 1:07:46.302
- I don't have a poker face,

1:07:46.395 --> 1:07:48.146
so I channeled all that
strength into this hand...

1:07:50.483 --> 1:07:51.816
She's making one
