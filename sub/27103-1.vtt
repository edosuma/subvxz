00:18.757 --> 00:22.152
My god!

No!

00:48.091 --> 00:49.091
Shit.

01:08.242 --> 01:09.610
Come on, come
on, come on, come on.

01:09.634 --> 01:12.463
Come on.

01:12.507 --> 01:13.943
Shit.

01:13.986 --> 01:14.465
Shit.

01:14.509 --> 01:16.119
Come on.

01:16.163 --> 01:17.077
OK.

01:17.120 --> 01:18.120
What the?

01:21.472 --> 01:22.472
Come on.

01:25.955 --> 01:28.871
Thank god.

01:28.914 --> 01:29.393
OK.

01:29.437 --> 01:30.829
Chuck.

01:30.873 --> 01:33.310
Chuck.

01:56.594 --> 01:57.594
Shit.

02:00.511 --> 02:01.425
Rings of Saturn.

02:01.469 --> 02:02.513
Chuck!

02:02.557 --> 02:03.340
Sam?

02:03.384 --> 02:04.820
What the hell?

02:04.863 --> 02:05.690
The phone has been ringing
for like two hours.

02:05.734 --> 02:06.952
And I'm working.

02:06.996 --> 02:08.606
Yeah, answering
the phone is working.

02:08.650 --> 02:11.000
Chill out, Mr. I'm
Going Off the Grid for a While.

02:11.043 --> 02:12.741
What, you lasted like two days?

02:12.784 --> 02:15.700
Yeah, well, things haven't
worked out quite as I planned.

02:15.744 --> 02:18.312
Being responsible for
an entire summer camp,

02:18.355 --> 02:20.052
what could possibly go wrong?

02:20.096 --> 02:21.706
You have no idea.

02:21.750 --> 02:24.144
No, actually, you might
have the exact idea, which

02:24.187 --> 02:26.494
is why I'm calling you,
'cause everything started out

02:26.537 --> 02:29.236
so great, and now there's
this crazed killer

02:29.279 --> 02:30.279
roaming the campground.

02:33.109 --> 02:34.241
Wait, really?

02:34.284 --> 02:35.981
Yes, Chuck, really.

02:36.025 --> 02:39.115
Everyone is dead,
or almost everyone.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.377
Whoa.

02:40.421 --> 02:42.205
Damn.

02:42.249 --> 02:45.600
I mean, that sometimes happens,
especially the camp counselors.

02:45.643 --> 02:46.601
But I just never thought--

02:46.644 --> 02:47.776
I know, I know.

02:47.819 --> 02:49.212
It's terrible.

02:49.256 --> 02:51.475
It really is terrible,
and I'm really scared.

02:51.519 --> 02:53.216
So I thought maybe
you can help me

02:53.260 --> 02:57.177
out, give me some king of advice
so I'm not, you know, dying.

02:57.220 --> 02:58.482
OK.

02:58.526 --> 03:00.528
Yeah, well, first
of all, your phone

03:00.571 --> 03:02.225
seems to be working fine.

03:02.269 --> 03:03.661
Wouldn't you rather
call the cops?

03:03.705 --> 03:04.532
I did.

03:04.575 --> 03:05.402
I called the sheriff.

03:05.446 --> 03:06.403
I left a voicemail.

03:06.447 --> 03:07.839
Wait, a voicemail?

03:07.883 --> 03:08.840
Yeah, a voicemail.

03:08.884 --> 03:10.146
I mean, he's 76.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.756
He doesn't really
work nights anymore,

03:11.800 --> 03:15.064
and-- and given that and the
town being 25 miles away,

03:15.107 --> 03:17.893
I mean, I don't think anyone's
getting here before I'm dead.

03:17.936 --> 03:19.764
How far off the
grid did you go?

03:19.808 --> 03:20.939
Far.

03:20.983 --> 03:22.419
25 miles.

03:22.463 --> 03:24.204
Gotcha.

03:24.247 --> 03:28.164
All right, well-- well, first,
I got to ask how many so far.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.253
What-- what do you mean?

03:30.297 --> 03:31.123
Like, body count.

03:31.167 --> 03:31.950
How many dead?

03:31.994 --> 03:34.214
I don't know.

03:34.257 --> 03:35.084
I don't know, you know.

03:35.127 --> 03:36.433
I'm a little flustered.

03:36.477 --> 03:37.932
Counting's not, like,
my thing right now.

03:37.956 --> 03:39.871
How did this even start?

03:39.915 --> 03:42.439
I'm not sure.

03:42.483 --> 03:44.528
All I remember is that
everything started out so

03:44.572 --> 03:46.095
great when we first got here.

04:15.385 --> 04:17.387
No phones, no shirt.

04:17.430 --> 04:20.084
Step right up.

04:20.129 --> 04:21.957
And I designed the
logo myself this year.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.195
I think they're pretty cool.

04:23.219 --> 04:24.327
What do you think, Carol?
Yeah?

04:24.351 --> 04:24.873
OK.

04:24.916 --> 04:25.569
Yeah?

04:25.613 --> 04:26.222
It's all right.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.745
Hey, Ted.

04:27.789 --> 04:29.332
Hey, thank you for choosing
Clear Vista this year.

04:29.356 --> 04:33.316
I know you had a lot of offers.

04:33.360 --> 04:34.317
Steve!

04:34.361 --> 04:35.318
The Kayak King.

04:35.362 --> 04:36.450
How you doing, man?

04:36.493 --> 04:37.929
So glad to have you back.

04:37.973 --> 04:38.887
My pleasure, my pleasure.

04:38.930 --> 04:39.583
Good to be back.

04:39.627 --> 04:40.802
Here you go.

04:40.845 --> 04:42.325
One thing, and
it's not a big deal.

04:42.369 --> 04:46.111
It's not a big deal, but,
um, they're canoes, so--

04:46.155 --> 04:47.287
don't even worry about it.

04:47.330 --> 04:48.157
It's fine.

04:48.200 --> 04:49.332
Yeah, not a big deal.

04:49.376 --> 04:50.420
What's up, Sam?

04:50.464 --> 04:51.291
Hey.

04:51.334 --> 04:51.987
Drew, right?

04:52.030 --> 04:52.683
Yeah.

04:52.727 --> 04:53.380
Find you one.

04:53.423 --> 04:54.990
There you are.

04:55.033 --> 04:56.097
I'm totally ready to
just unplug from the world

04:56.121 --> 04:56.774
and catch a vibe
with this place.

04:56.818 --> 04:58.907
Beer?

04:58.950 --> 05:00.778
It's really peaceful here.

05:00.822 --> 05:01.562
Super peaceful.

05:01.605 --> 05:02.432
That's the spirit.

05:02.476 --> 05:03.912
You guys hear that?

05:15.532 --> 05:16.620
Wait, wait, wait.

05:16.664 --> 05:18.361
Imani's there?

05:18.405 --> 05:21.146
Well, I mean, I couldn't not
hire her because she dumped me.

05:21.190 --> 05:22.539
That's discrimination.

05:22.583 --> 05:24.454
God.

05:24.498 --> 05:25.760
Hi, Imani.

05:25.803 --> 05:27.327
I don't wanna be
a whiny bitch, but--

05:27.370 --> 05:30.678
Might wanna just
leave it there then.

05:30.721 --> 05:32.090
- Thank you, Freddie.
- Here you go.

05:32.114 --> 05:33.115
Thanks.

05:33.158 --> 05:34.812
Is this unplugging necessary?

05:34.856 --> 05:37.380
Nature is our nature.
Come on.

05:37.424 --> 05:39.469
It's going to be a fun awesome--
- OK, whatever.

05:39.513 --> 05:42.037
--relaxing weekend.

05:42.080 --> 05:44.561
Here you go.

05:44.605 --> 05:46.694
If you're look for other
ways to stimulate yourself,

05:46.737 --> 05:47.956
just you let me know.

05:52.439 --> 05:54.310
OK.
Here you are.

05:54.354 --> 05:57.705
- Yeah.
- Thanks, Brad.

05:57.748 --> 06:01.317
Guess I'll have to give that
harassment speech after all.

06:01.361 --> 06:04.451
Look, guys, when the kids get
here, it's really hard work.

06:04.494 --> 06:08.455
So you're going to want to
appreciate every moment.

06:11.458 --> 06:12.894
Yeah.

06:12.937 --> 06:14.286
Being in nature?

06:19.335 --> 06:20.205
That's what you are saying.

06:20.249 --> 06:20.945
You know?

06:20.989 --> 06:22.294
Right.

06:22.338 --> 06:23.295
- Commune with nature.
- Right.

06:23.339 --> 06:24.209
Thank you.

06:24.253 --> 06:26.037
That's what-- exactly.

06:26.081 --> 06:27.778
Jamie, right?

06:27.822 --> 06:30.142
You gotta give these kids the
best summer they've ever had.

06:32.479 --> 06:33.479
Wait, hold on a second.

06:40.312 --> 06:41.444
OK.

06:41.488 --> 06:43.968
So of the group,
who's dead so far?

06:44.012 --> 06:45.076
OK, I wanna
say all of them,

06:45.100 --> 06:47.015
but definitely most of them.

06:47.058 --> 06:49.626
And-- and when we say
dead, you mean killed.

06:49.670 --> 06:50.845
Yeah.

06:50.888 --> 06:52.977
Stabbed, mutilated,
ripped apart.

06:53.021 --> 06:54.414
And now he's hunting me.

06:54.457 --> 06:55.937
And you've seen him?

06:55.980 --> 06:57.982
Yeah, freaky
looking dude, really scary.

06:58.026 --> 06:58.983
Ugly, ugly.

06:59.027 --> 07:00.463
I mean, hideously ugly dude.

07:00.507 --> 07:04.859
Like Freddy ugly
or Matt Cordell ugly?

07:06.382 --> 07:08.166
Maniac Cop.

07:08.210 --> 07:09.516
I'm just gonna say ugly.

07:09.559 --> 07:10.710
And you're
sure it's a dude?

07:10.734 --> 07:12.054
Well, isn't
it always a dude?

07:12.083 --> 07:14.521
Aw, just ask Jason's mother.

07:14.564 --> 07:16.653
Excuse me.

07:16.697 --> 07:18.655
$26.66.

07:23.660 --> 07:25.140
My god.

07:25.183 --> 07:26.620
I think he's found me.

07:26.663 --> 07:28.143
My god.

07:28.186 --> 07:29.187
Chuck.

07:29.231 --> 07:30.493
Got your Serial Slasher card?

07:30.537 --> 07:31.537
God.

07:32.887 --> 07:33.844
Kill.

07:33.888 --> 07:35.759
Kill, kill.

07:37.500 --> 07:39.300
Because that's
like the classic bag that you--

07:40.677 --> 07:42.418
Chuck, do you hear that?

07:42.462 --> 07:43.593
Hear what?

07:43.637 --> 07:44.768
Voices, voices.

07:44.812 --> 07:46.553
The store is
full of customers.

07:46.596 --> 07:48.032
I hear tons of voices.

07:48.076 --> 07:50.339
No, no, no, not them.

07:53.777 --> 07:56.214
Gas.

07:56.258 --> 07:59.609
I smell gasoline.

07:59.653 --> 08:00.610
Gas?

08:00.654 --> 08:02.133
Sam, what is going on there?

08:03.744 --> 08:05.136
My god.

08:06.616 --> 08:08.096
Shit.

08:08.139 --> 08:09.097
Shit.
- Sam?

08:09.140 --> 08:10.140
My--

08:10.620 --> 08:12.013
Hello?

08:12.056 --> 08:12.666
Sam?

08:12.709 --> 08:13.709
My god.

08:56.797 --> 08:58.276
Shit.

08:58.320 --> 08:59.320
OK.

09:22.736 --> 09:23.258
What?

09:23.301 --> 09:24.433
Sam.

09:24.476 --> 09:25.826
You almost gave
me a heart attack

09:25.869 --> 09:27.175
hanging up on me like that.

09:27.218 --> 09:29.090
You gave me a heart
attack blowing up

09:29.133 --> 09:31.048
my phone for everyone
in this camp to hear.

09:31.092 --> 09:34.138
Well, OK-- well, in the
spirit of offering you advice,

09:34.182 --> 09:37.577
I'd suggest maybe
silencing your phone.

09:37.620 --> 09:39.927
You don't think I already
thought to silence my--

09:40.797 --> 09:41.798
OK, look.

09:41.842 --> 09:43.234
I had a thought.

09:43.278 --> 09:45.976
OK, you said this crazed
killer is a guy, right?

09:46.020 --> 09:49.327
OK, so maybe we should talk
about the guys out there,

09:49.371 --> 09:50.677
you know?

09:50.720 --> 09:52.504
See if we can figure
out who this asshole is.

09:52.548 --> 09:54.985
How does knowing who
it is help me not die?

09:55.029 --> 09:57.335
Well, I think figuring
out what they want

09:57.379 --> 09:58.989
could help you not die.

09:59.033 --> 10:00.512
Smart.

10:00.556 --> 10:02.403
Like, is it an old camper
who got teased as a kid

10:02.427 --> 10:03.603
and is back for blood?

10:03.646 --> 10:04.734
No.

10:04.778 --> 10:06.344
Or is it a parent
who's looking

10:06.388 --> 10:09.434
for revenge after a counselor
let their kid drown?

10:09.478 --> 10:11.175
Jesus, I hope not, no.

10:11.219 --> 10:14.744
Or does one of the counselors
have a formerly conjoined twin?

10:14.788 --> 10:16.093
What movie is that from?

10:16.137 --> 10:17.442
That could be a huge problem.

10:17.486 --> 10:18.811
No, it's nothing
like that, Chuck, OK?

10:18.835 --> 10:20.204
It's-- it's nothing
like that, I promise.

10:20.228 --> 10:20.881
OK?

10:20.924 --> 10:23.013
OK.

10:23.057 --> 10:24.275
OK, let me think.

10:24.319 --> 10:26.103
Um.

10:26.147 --> 10:28.671
You mentioned
some guy named Steve.

10:28.715 --> 10:29.585
Yeah.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.719
Steve, the Kayak King.

10:32.762 --> 10:33.762
But it's not him.

10:39.203 --> 10:40.901
My god.

10:40.944 --> 10:44.165
Steve, the Kayak King.

10:44.208 --> 10:48.430
He's up shit's creek now, and
I'd say without a paddle, but--

10:48.473 --> 10:49.823
Who does this?

10:49.866 --> 10:51.041
What kind of psycho?

10:59.484 --> 11:00.921
Holy shit.

11:00.964 --> 11:01.835
Is that Ted?

11:01.878 --> 11:02.618
It's Steve.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.228
The Kayak King.

11:04.272 --> 11:05.665
Guys, he
isn't the only one.

11:05.708 --> 11:07.884
We found Bob and Carol's
bodies in the kitchen.

11:07.928 --> 11:08.972
Ted and Alice are missing.

11:09.016 --> 11:10.017
So is Drew.

11:10.060 --> 11:11.148
Who's Drew?

11:11.192 --> 11:12.541
from the city.

11:12.584 --> 11:13.411
Missing.

11:13.455 --> 11:14.630
Not necessarily dead.

11:14.674 --> 11:15.631
So you're an optimist.

11:15.675 --> 11:16.676
Wait.

11:16.719 --> 11:17.938
What if one of them did this?

11:17.981 --> 11:20.331
This is insane.

11:20.375 --> 11:21.376
We have to do something.

11:21.419 --> 11:23.552
Sam, what do we do?

11:24.945 --> 11:26.381
What?

11:26.424 --> 11:28.252
Well, we all gotta--

11:28.296 --> 11:29.427
OK, we all need to--

11:32.779 --> 11:34.041
We all just need to--

11:34.084 --> 11:35.651
we really gotta--

11:35.695 --> 11:37.784
Put an end to this
bullshit, get our cell

11:37.827 --> 11:40.787
phones and call the police.

11:44.660 --> 11:45.443
What the hell?

11:45.487 --> 11:46.836
No.

11:46.880 --> 11:48.185
No, no, no, no.

11:48.229 --> 11:49.380
Somebody
better explain quick.

11:49.404 --> 11:50.144
Sam, where
are the phones?

11:50.187 --> 11:51.014
It's impossible.

11:51.058 --> 11:51.711
I put them all in here.

11:51.754 --> 11:52.755
I locked it.

11:52.799 --> 11:53.819
No one knows the combo but me.

11:53.843 --> 11:55.149
You mean your birthday?

11:55.192 --> 11:58.065
Hey.

12:13.428 --> 12:14.385
Come on!

12:14.429 --> 12:16.344
What the hell's going on?

12:20.827 --> 12:22.785
That's bad.

12:22.829 --> 12:24.091
Right?

12:24.134 --> 12:25.570
What now, Sam?

12:25.614 --> 12:27.659
Are there any other
vehicles on the property?

12:27.703 --> 12:29.749
No, no, this was it.

12:29.792 --> 12:30.793
Great.

12:30.837 --> 12:32.229
Looks like we're walking.

12:32.273 --> 12:33.448
No, no, no, I--

12:33.491 --> 12:34.405
I don't think
that's a good idea.

12:34.449 --> 12:35.885
I mean, guys, look around.

12:35.929 --> 12:38.192
There's swamp and marshland
in every direction.

12:38.235 --> 12:39.802
A town's not for 25 miles.

12:39.846 --> 12:40.803
OK, so we hump it.

12:40.847 --> 12:42.196
We can take that.

12:42.239 --> 12:44.111
Maybe when the sun
comes up, but not now.

12:44.154 --> 12:46.069
There's snakes and
gators out there--

12:46.113 --> 12:48.245
poisonous snakes, giant gators.

12:48.289 --> 12:49.812
Great.

12:49.856 --> 12:51.355
So we get sliced up by a
madman or eaten by reptiles.

12:51.379 --> 12:52.467
Did you see Steve?

12:52.510 --> 12:53.816
I vote reptiles.

12:53.860 --> 12:55.446
There's gotta
be a third choice.

12:55.470 --> 12:57.535
What if we hole up
in the cabins until morning?

12:57.559 --> 13:00.649
Yeah, 'cause those old
ass cabins are super secure.

13:00.692 --> 13:01.824
No, no, no.

13:01.868 --> 13:03.280
Jamie, that's a good
idea, all right?

13:03.304 --> 13:04.131
We can find an area, and
we can make it as safe

13:04.174 --> 13:05.132
and secure as possible.

13:05.175 --> 13:06.263
No, Sam, no.

13:06.307 --> 13:07.438
Look, that's not enough.

13:07.482 --> 13:08.546
I wanna take the
fight to this guy.

13:08.570 --> 13:10.137
Fair enough, OK?

13:10.180 --> 13:11.834
We'll-- we'll divided
into teams, OK?

13:11.878 --> 13:14.619
Half of us on defense to make
a safe place, the other half

13:14.663 --> 13:15.751
of us on offense.

13:15.795 --> 13:16.839
We'll set up traps.

13:16.883 --> 13:18.362
We'll take it to this guy.

13:56.139 --> 13:57.140
Wait, wait wait.

13:57.184 --> 13:59.055
You went patrolling by yourself?

13:59.099 --> 14:01.710
Well, it's pretty logical
in the heat of the moment.

14:01.753 --> 14:02.885
Yeah.

14:02.929 --> 14:04.626
OK, that's fair and
all, but it also

14:04.669 --> 14:05.932
means you get killed quicker.

14:05.975 --> 14:07.255
Can we just
move on, please?

14:11.111 --> 14:12.982
Come on.

14:13.026 --> 14:15.245
I don't think
this is a good idea.

14:15.289 --> 14:16.856
Why, 'cause
Sam didn't say so?

14:16.899 --> 14:17.987
Yeah, kinda.

14:18.031 --> 14:19.554
Look.

14:19.597 --> 14:22.513
They're trying to fight
a maniac with toothpicks

14:22.557 --> 14:24.864
and pots and pans.

14:24.907 --> 14:26.867
All right, if I'm gonna
die, I'm gonna die trying.

14:26.909 --> 14:28.606
Yeah, die running.

14:28.650 --> 14:30.608
Come on, man, that's
what you're saying.

14:30.652 --> 14:33.002
Good people don't run
away from a fight.

14:33.046 --> 14:34.699
And guess what, Nancy?

14:34.743 --> 14:36.721
You're not not gonna be good
for anything if you're dead.

14:36.745 --> 14:38.181
Hey, what's going on, guys?

14:38.225 --> 14:39.898
Sam already said
it's too dark out there

14:39.922 --> 14:40.531
for us to go out.

14:40.575 --> 14:41.315
Sam.

14:41.358 --> 14:42.838
Right, yeah, Sam.

14:42.882 --> 14:43.491
Plus, I don't wanna
just desert everyone.

14:43.534 --> 14:44.492
Deserting?

14:44.535 --> 14:45.493
Whoa, you guys, I told you--

14:45.536 --> 14:46.668
We're not deserting anyone.

14:46.711 --> 14:48.235
All right, you're
saving yourself.

14:48.278 --> 14:48.931
--there's swap and
marshland in every direction,

14:48.975 --> 14:49.975
poisonous--

14:50.977 --> 14:51.934
You know what?

14:51.978 --> 14:52.804
I don't have time for this.

14:52.848 --> 14:54.415
I'm getting out of here.

14:58.549 --> 15:02.336
Holy shit!

15:05.905 --> 15:07.819
Nancy, run!

15:07.863 --> 15:09.821
Jesus!

15:19.788 --> 15:23.400
It was beyond traumatic.

15:23.444 --> 15:24.880
And that's it?

15:24.924 --> 15:26.099
Yeah, yeah.

15:26.142 --> 15:27.535
Horrifying.

15:27.578 --> 15:28.971
But why didn't he kill you?

15:29.015 --> 15:29.711
I don't know.

15:29.754 --> 15:30.712
You know, I--

15:30.755 --> 15:31.582
I don't-- I just don't know.

15:31.626 --> 15:32.409
Well, think about it.

15:32.453 --> 15:33.758
Why?

15:33.802 --> 15:37.762
Why-- why did he
kill Freddie or Nancy

15:37.806 --> 15:39.155
or Steve or any of the others?

15:39.199 --> 15:40.504
Why-- why does it even matter?

15:40.548 --> 15:43.159
OK, here's a different
question for you.

15:43.203 --> 15:44.552
Are you covered in blood?

15:44.595 --> 15:46.293
Chuck, are you
even listening to me?

15:46.336 --> 15:48.121
Just answer the question, Sam.

15:48.164 --> 15:50.340
No.

15:50.384 --> 15:53.213
Um, a little.

15:53.256 --> 15:54.736
Why?

15:54.779 --> 15:57.173
So if you were just a
witness to these murders,

15:57.217 --> 15:59.219
then how come you're
covered in blood?

15:59.262 --> 16:00.002
You know, I don't--

16:00.046 --> 16:01.612
I just don't know.

16:01.656 --> 16:03.503
I'm, helping my niece
with her creative writing

16:03.527 --> 16:04.876
assignment.

16:04.920 --> 16:07.575
Man, the crap education
kids get this days.

16:07.618 --> 16:08.706
Whose blood is it?

16:08.750 --> 16:09.838
What do you mean?

16:09.881 --> 16:11.144
Well, is it your blood?

16:11.187 --> 16:13.102
How-- how-- how would
I be able to tell?

16:13.146 --> 16:15.583
Well, are you bleeding?

16:15.626 --> 16:16.584
No, I don't--

16:16.627 --> 16:17.280
I don't-- I don't think so.

16:17.324 --> 16:18.760
No.

16:18.803 --> 16:20.675
If you were just a
witness to these murders,

16:20.718 --> 16:22.546
why are you covered in blood?

16:22.590 --> 16:24.592
Because I was a close witness.

16:24.635 --> 16:25.897
I mean, I was--

16:25.941 --> 16:28.030
I was, like, a very
hands-on witness.

16:28.074 --> 16:30.163
I was really, like, right there.

16:30.206 --> 16:31.206
OK, what else?

16:34.210 --> 16:37.257
Are you holding a
weapon of any kind?

16:37.300 --> 16:38.345
Probably a sharp one?

16:38.388 --> 16:39.389
No, no.

16:39.433 --> 16:41.609
I mean, just this baseball bat.

16:41.652 --> 16:43.393
Wait.

16:43.437 --> 16:45.047
I mean, a knife.

16:45.091 --> 16:45.874
Sort of.

16:45.917 --> 16:46.701
Sort of knife?

16:46.744 --> 16:47.876
Well, I don't know.

16:47.919 --> 16:48.877
Would you consider
this a weapon?

16:48.920 --> 16:50.487
In this context, yes.

16:50.531 --> 16:52.228
But you could have
had it because you

16:52.272 --> 16:53.838
were protecting yourself.

16:53.882 --> 16:55.275
Where did you get it?

16:55.318 --> 16:56.624
I don't know.

16:56.667 --> 16:57.886
You really don't know?

16:57.929 --> 16:59.279
No, I don't know.

16:59.322 --> 17:00.517
I mean, I thought I was
holding a baseball bat,

17:00.541 --> 17:02.847
but now I have a
really weird knife.

17:02.891 --> 17:04.806
Weird how?

17:04.848 --> 17:06.112
I don't know.

17:06.155 --> 17:08.069
I mean, it's like
made of like jawbone,

17:08.114 --> 17:10.377
like the serrations are teeth.

17:10.420 --> 17:13.336
It's got like
a real sacrificial vibe.

17:13.380 --> 17:15.164
And I don't know, it's
hard to place the era.

17:15.208 --> 17:19.167
Like the knife that you
described the killer carrying?

17:22.998 --> 17:23.477
Yes.

17:23.520 --> 17:26.262
Sam.

17:26.306 --> 17:27.220
OK.

17:27.262 --> 17:29.004
Look.

17:29.048 --> 17:34.357
I hate to ask you this, but are
you sure you're not the killer?

17:34.401 --> 17:39.971
I can't be 100% sure.

17:42.887 --> 17:45.673
Maybe this is like a Jacob's
Ladder kind of thing,

17:45.716 --> 17:47.556
and I'm already dead,
and none of this is real.

17:47.588 --> 17:49.851
Well, that's not
possible because I'm here

17:49.894 --> 17:51.635
and I'm very much alive.

17:51.679 --> 17:52.854
Damn it.

17:52.897 --> 17:54.899
Not that, you
know, you're alive.

17:54.943 --> 17:56.051
But, you know what I mean.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.598
OK, look.

17:57.641 --> 18:00.166
I mean, you're-- you're
definitely not the killer type.

18:00.209 --> 18:01.645
You know, this is just not you.

18:01.689 --> 18:04.213
Maybe you're like out of
your mind or something.

18:04.257 --> 18:05.432
Did somebody drug you?

18:05.475 --> 18:07.129
No, I don't think so.

18:07.173 --> 18:09.131
Well, and you keep
saying that the killer's

18:09.175 --> 18:13.875
like hideously ugly, and
you are definitely not that.

18:13.918 --> 18:15.703
- Aw.
- Wait.

18:19.489 --> 18:20.534
Are you wearing a mask?

18:20.577 --> 18:22.188
No.

18:22.231 --> 18:23.145
Are you sure?

18:23.189 --> 18:25.669
Um.

18:25.713 --> 18:26.540
I'm pretty sure.

18:26.583 --> 18:27.802
Damn.

18:27.845 --> 18:30.457
That would've
explained everything.

18:30.500 --> 18:33.155
'Cause, like, if you're
physically killing somebody

18:33.199 --> 18:35.070
but that's not
really you, then this

18:35.114 --> 18:37.594
could've been the case where
the consciousness of the killer

18:37.638 --> 18:43.905
was like possessed by an
object, like an evil mask.

18:48.257 --> 18:49.998
My god.

18:51.434 --> 18:52.827
Kill.

18:52.870 --> 18:54.220
Kill him.

18:54.263 --> 18:57.136
Kill.

18:57.179 --> 18:58.179
Um, Chuck?

19:02.097 --> 19:03.533
Kill.

19:03.577 --> 19:06.493
Kill him.

19:06.536 --> 19:08.495
Kill, kill, kill.

19:08.538 --> 19:10.018
Kill.

19:10.061 --> 19:13.021
Kill.

20:50.336 --> 20:51.336
My god!

20:53.948 --> 20:56.342
My god.
- What?

21:02.565 --> 21:05.220
I'm the killer.

21:05.264 --> 21:06.134
My god.

21:06.177 --> 21:08.484
What am I gonna do?

21:08.528 --> 21:11.008
You didn't realize
you were murdering him?

21:11.052 --> 21:12.619
Stabbing, tying him up?

21:12.662 --> 21:14.273
No.

21:14.316 --> 21:17.406
I just remember standing in
front of him already dead.

21:17.450 --> 21:19.321
Well, what did you
think you were doing?

21:19.365 --> 21:20.670
I don't know.

21:20.714 --> 21:24.935
Talking to you now, it's
coming more into focus.

21:24.979 --> 21:27.242
Honestly, I don't think
I was thinking anything

21:27.286 --> 21:28.809
until the mask came off.

21:28.852 --> 21:31.681
You really didn't know that
you were murdering Steve?

21:31.725 --> 21:33.509
No, no.

21:33.553 --> 21:35.424
I was staring at him like
you'd stare at anyone

21:35.468 --> 21:38.253
you found diced up and
dead hanging from a tree.

21:38.297 --> 21:39.602
It was just horrible.

21:39.646 --> 21:41.561
But you know now that
it was you doing it.

21:41.604 --> 21:45.042
I saw
what the mask saw.

21:45.086 --> 21:47.088
You forcing me to
remember everything

21:47.131 --> 21:50.526
is bringing up stuff that I
didn't even know was there.

21:50.570 --> 21:52.223
It's kinda freaking me out.

21:52.267 --> 21:53.616
So, yeah.

21:53.660 --> 21:56.358
I'm pretty sure it was me.

21:56.402 --> 21:59.230
I'm sorry I dragged
you into this, Chuck.

21:59.274 --> 22:00.014
No.

22:00.057 --> 22:01.363
Don't apologize.

22:01.407 --> 22:03.234
You know I live for
this kind of thing.

22:03.278 --> 22:04.758
Look.

22:04.801 --> 22:06.518
I found some reference
books, some really old stuff

22:06.542 --> 22:09.023
that-- that we had in the
storage room in storage,

22:09.066 --> 22:10.633
stuff that never sold.

22:10.677 --> 22:13.201
You mean stuff you stashed
away so you could keep it.

22:13.244 --> 22:14.376
Maybe.

22:14.420 --> 22:16.247
Um, anyway, I know
that we're going

22:16.291 --> 22:18.902
to get to the bottom of this.

22:18.946 --> 22:20.991
So what should I do now?

22:21.035 --> 22:22.384
Lock myself away?

22:22.428 --> 22:23.883
I mean, I don't want to
kill any more people.

22:23.907 --> 22:25.213
Is there anyone left to kill?

22:25.256 --> 22:26.432
Yeah.

22:26.475 --> 22:27.824
Yeah, I mean, there's tons.

22:27.868 --> 22:29.957
I mean, you know, I
think-- yes, I think so.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.828
There are people
alive technically,

22:31.872 --> 22:33.047
which is good, and we wanna--

22:33.090 --> 22:34.701
we wanna keep them that way.

22:34.744 --> 22:37.007
This conversation's harder
knowing that I'm the killer.

22:39.706 --> 22:40.706
What about Imani?

22:42.056 --> 22:44.145
Still can't believe
you invited her back.

22:44.928 --> 22:46.408
How's that going?

22:46.452 --> 22:48.454
You guys cool?

22:48.497 --> 22:50.432
Can't we just keep talking
about me killing people?

22:50.456 --> 22:52.022
Well, yeah.

22:52.066 --> 22:53.304
Yeah, I mean-- well, that--
that's where I was going.

22:53.328 --> 22:55.069
I-- I was gonna say like, if--

22:55.112 --> 22:57.288
if she still cares about you,
you could confide in her,

22:57.332 --> 22:59.290
and then maybe she can help you.

22:59.334 --> 23:00.030
Yeah.

23:00.074 --> 23:00.509
Yeah.

23:00.553 --> 23:02.032
Um.

23:02.076 --> 23:02.729
OK.

23:02.772 --> 23:04.252
I just-- I'm--

23:04.295 --> 23:06.255
I'm really not really sure
where she is right now.

23:07.821 --> 23:09.257
OK, I think Imani's dead.

23:09.300 --> 23:10.258
Wait, what?

23:10.301 --> 23:11.172
Why didn't you tell me that?

23:11.215 --> 23:12.521
I don't know.

23:12.565 --> 23:13.479
I just--

23:13.522 --> 23:14.828
You just remembered.

23:14.871 --> 23:15.829
Yes.

23:15.872 --> 23:17.526
Damn it!

23:22.488 --> 23:27.667
God, she was-- she
was really something.

23:38.634 --> 23:40.593
OK, guys, well--

23:40.636 --> 23:42.899
hold on.

23:42.943 --> 23:44.727
OK, guys.

23:44.771 --> 23:46.488
OK, I don't think-- here,
can you hold that for me

23:46.512 --> 23:47.251
real quick?

23:47.295 --> 23:48.557
It's not working.

23:48.601 --> 23:50.124
Maybe try to get it
to work if you can.

23:50.167 --> 23:51.081
All right, guys, well,
welcome to Camp Clear Vista.

23:51.125 --> 23:52.822
My name is Steve.

23:52.866 --> 23:54.017
Some of you know that already
'cause you're in the best cabin

23:54.041 --> 23:54.694
ever.

23:54.737 --> 23:55.737
My cabin, right?

23:59.786 --> 24:02.528
This is perfect.

24:02.571 --> 24:06.096
The camp, the kids,
the counselors.

24:06.140 --> 24:08.229
Yeah, Steve's
really good with kids.

24:08.272 --> 24:09.404
And those kayaks.

24:09.448 --> 24:10.927
But these are in fact what?

24:10.971 --> 24:11.798
Canoes.

24:11.841 --> 24:12.799
Great, that's right.

24:12.842 --> 24:13.800
I'm glad you guys knew that.

24:13.843 --> 24:16.150
So camp ends on Friday.

24:16.193 --> 24:18.631
What are we going to do then?
- I don't know.

24:18.674 --> 24:22.504
You know this is just
a summer fling for me.

24:22.548 --> 24:23.548
It's more than that.

24:32.383 --> 24:33.820
What?

24:33.863 --> 24:35.212
Come on.

24:35.256 --> 24:35.952
Are you worried about
the kids seeing us?

24:35.996 --> 24:36.823
No.

24:36.866 --> 24:37.866
Have to learn sometime.

24:41.305 --> 24:42.305
Then what?

24:47.050 --> 24:50.837
I don't know.
Why can't you just relax?

24:50.880 --> 24:51.664
You know?

24:51.707 --> 24:53.187
Have a good time.

24:53.230 --> 24:55.190
And when it's all done,
you'll have a good memory.

25:00.455 --> 25:02.022
Just enjoy it.

25:02.065 --> 25:04.807
Now these are only
to be used to the water, OK?

25:04.851 --> 25:06.505
It's not for hitting people, OK?

25:06.548 --> 25:09.769
It can also be used for
air guitar or as a golf--

25:09.812 --> 25:12.946
you know, like a, um,
club there, OK, guys?

25:12.989 --> 25:14.643
But not for hitting,
definitely, OK?

25:14.687 --> 25:16.403
And don't worry if you end up
in the water 'cause we send

25:16.427 --> 25:18.255
a scuba diver out
there about a week ago

25:18.299 --> 25:20.910
to check for alligators, and,
he hasn't come back yet,

25:20.954 --> 25:22.999
so I think he's doing
a very thorough job.

25:23.043 --> 25:25.654
If you see him, you
know, let us know.

25:25.698 --> 25:26.655
You know, people were worried.

25:26.699 --> 25:29.223
So all right.

25:29.266 --> 25:30.616
Don't look like a sad puppy.

25:30.659 --> 25:32.202
Why do people think I
look like a puppy dog?

25:32.226 --> 25:33.923
'Cause you do.

25:33.967 --> 25:35.969
Come here.

25:36.012 --> 25:37.012
Come here.

25:40.364 --> 25:42.279
Whoa, hey!

25:43.716 --> 25:45.065
No.

25:45.108 --> 25:46.588
How could you?

25:46.632 --> 25:48.087
Everybody, we're gonna
play and laugh at Sam, OK?

25:48.111 --> 25:49.391
He just fell in the water there.

25:54.814 --> 25:56.598
Steve, save me!

25:56.642 --> 25:58.010
That's why you wear
the life preservers.

25:58.034 --> 25:59.819
That's why you wear
the life preservers.

25:59.862 --> 26:00.862
You fell for it.

26:05.389 --> 26:07.087
I'm gonna destroy this thing.

26:07.130 --> 26:08.784
Be very careful
how you do that.

26:38.901 --> 26:41.469
Sam.

26:41.512 --> 26:42.601
Sam, what's going on?

26:46.822 --> 26:48.476
I tried to burn the mask.

26:48.519 --> 26:50.130
Your face is
burning, isn't it?

26:50.173 --> 26:51.697
Yeah.

26:51.740 --> 26:54.047
I was worried about that.

26:54.090 --> 26:57.485
I'm afraid the thing
probably imprinted on you.

26:57.528 --> 27:01.097
There's plenty of instances
of that happening in here.

27:01.141 --> 27:02.446
How do you know that?

27:02.490 --> 27:05.145
Sam, please, you
called me for a reason.

27:07.147 --> 27:07.800
Wait.

27:07.843 --> 27:09.584
Shh, shh, shh.

27:09.628 --> 27:11.151
Hey.

27:11.194 --> 27:12.432
I think I saw that son of
a bitch heading this way.

27:12.456 --> 27:14.763
Do we really
wanna find him?

27:14.807 --> 27:17.723
When I catch this guy, I'm
gonna beat him till he's dead.

27:17.766 --> 27:18.830
Then revive him
so I can chop him

27:18.854 --> 27:20.595
up into little bitty pieces.

27:23.598 --> 27:24.555
They're on to me.

27:24.599 --> 27:25.687
They're coming after me.

27:25.731 --> 27:26.601
Who?

27:26.645 --> 27:27.907
Whoever's still alive.

27:27.950 --> 27:29.449
How do they
know you're the killer?

27:29.473 --> 27:30.581
They tried to burn the
cabin down with me in it.

27:30.605 --> 27:31.925
That's a pretty
goddamn good clue.

27:31.954 --> 27:33.192
This doesn't
make any sense.

27:33.216 --> 27:34.000
Why would Sam do this?

27:34.043 --> 27:35.262
I don't care.

27:35.305 --> 27:36.959
I just want him dead.

27:37.003 --> 27:38.613
What about
giving yourself up?

27:38.657 --> 27:40.397
Like, explain the situation.

27:40.441 --> 27:44.053
Maybe they can restrain you so
you don't kill anybody else.

27:44.097 --> 27:45.098
Brad would kill me.

27:45.141 --> 27:46.379
He'd ripped my head off, Chuck.

27:46.403 --> 27:47.883
I'm trying to stay alive.

28:01.114 --> 28:03.420
OK, where are you now?

28:03.464 --> 28:04.247
Still hiding.

28:04.291 --> 28:05.291
Hold on.

28:38.238 --> 28:39.326
Yeah, OK, I think I'm--

28:39.369 --> 28:40.370
I think I'm good for now.

28:40.414 --> 28:40.980
OK.

28:41.023 --> 28:41.720
OK, good.

28:41.763 --> 28:43.373
All right.

28:43.417 --> 28:47.595
So just-- just stay where you
are and-- and hunker down.

28:47.638 --> 28:48.901
OK.

28:48.944 --> 28:49.944
Um.

29:01.522 --> 29:02.697
OK, I'm hunkered.

29:02.741 --> 29:04.046
OK, good.

29:04.090 --> 29:05.918
I think we just need
to regroup and focus.

29:05.961 --> 29:06.701
Yeah.
Right.

29:06.745 --> 29:07.833
OK.

29:07.876 --> 29:09.071
And-- and
maybe we can come

29:09.095 --> 29:11.271
up with like a
timeline of exactly

29:11.314 --> 29:13.186
what you did with the mask on.

29:13.229 --> 29:13.882
OK.

29:13.926 --> 29:15.318
OK.
Yeah.

29:15.362 --> 29:17.035
OK, what is your
first memory of things

29:17.059 --> 29:19.670
going wrong or going weird?

29:19.714 --> 29:22.848
OK, I remember being confused
as to why I was running.

29:22.891 --> 29:23.979
Running.

29:24.023 --> 29:25.023
Running where?

29:26.503 --> 29:28.375
Away from a dead tree.

29:30.333 --> 29:31.900
Yeah.

29:31.944 --> 29:33.573
I-- I remember something bad
happened near a dead tree,

29:33.597 --> 29:35.077
and--

29:35.121 --> 29:36.078
What?

29:36.122 --> 29:37.601
Shit.

29:37.645 --> 29:39.429
İt's right
there, and I just--

29:39.473 --> 29:41.083
I can't remember.

29:41.127 --> 29:42.128
Shit.

29:42.171 --> 29:43.451
OK, what do you remember?

29:46.523 --> 29:47.523
I remember a pool.

30:32.134 --> 30:35.094
Hey, pal.

30:35.137 --> 30:37.052
Kill.

30:37.096 --> 30:39.750
Having a little palm
party there perving on us?

30:47.802 --> 30:50.849
You chopped
his head in half?

30:50.892 --> 30:51.892
Yeah.

30:54.069 --> 30:55.418
What did you do to her?

31:19.225 --> 31:20.966
I liked it better when
I didn't remember.

31:38.635 --> 31:39.810
Whoa, hey.

31:39.854 --> 31:40.942
Kill those lights.

31:40.986 --> 31:42.378
What is the
matter with you?

31:42.422 --> 31:44.119
You wanna flag
everybody around

31:44.163 --> 31:46.010
here, get them to all come in
here and get to the good stuff

31:46.034 --> 31:47.644
before us?

31:47.688 --> 31:49.013
Come on, they're all out
looking for that grave thing

31:49.037 --> 31:50.430
anyway.

31:50.473 --> 31:52.060
Yeah, which gives
us a chance to party.

31:52.084 --> 31:53.346
So help me out?

31:57.263 --> 31:59.134
Yes.
Jackpot.

32:03.834 --> 32:05.184
Now all we need is--

32:07.229 --> 32:08.229
--chocolate.

32:11.842 --> 32:12.882
Kill.

32:18.197 --> 32:21.113
Kill Carol.

32:54.581 --> 32:55.843
Damn, Sam.

32:55.886 --> 32:56.539
I know.

32:56.583 --> 32:58.019
I hate myself.

32:58.063 --> 32:59.736
Well, is it too
obvious to ask why didn't

32:59.760 --> 33:01.414
you just take the mask off?

33:01.457 --> 33:03.111
When it's on, I don't want to.

33:03.155 --> 33:04.243
Yeah.

33:04.286 --> 33:05.418
Shoulda figured.

33:05.461 --> 33:07.028
But this kill
was different.

33:07.072 --> 33:08.812
I think it pushed
me a little too far.

33:08.856 --> 33:13.252
I-- I-- I became aware of
myself for just a split second.

33:59.950 --> 34:02.344
No.

34:02.388 --> 34:03.867
No.

34:03.911 --> 34:04.911
Please.

34:07.958 --> 34:11.658
Please don't make me.

34:28.588 --> 34:31.069
Kill.

34:33.071 --> 34:36.030
Kill, kill, kill.

34:36.074 --> 34:40.469
Kill Steve, the Kayak King.

34:40.513 --> 34:45.431
Kill the Kayak King, Steve.

34:45.474 --> 34:47.433
Steve.

34:48.695 --> 34:50.088
Hey.

34:50.130 --> 34:51.935
Just getting 'em ready
for their maiden voyage.

34:51.958 --> 34:53.154
Kill Steve.

34:53.178 --> 34:56.311
Who-- who is that?

34:56.355 --> 34:58.357
What are you doing here?

34:58.400 --> 35:00.924
What are you wearing?

35:01.925 --> 35:03.753
Wow.

35:03.797 --> 35:05.494
This is so bad.

35:05.538 --> 35:07.931
So how many do you
think you've killed?

35:07.975 --> 35:10.586
You
know what I think?

35:10.630 --> 35:13.763
This asshole should
kill himself.

35:13.807 --> 35:16.331
How long have
you been listening?

35:16.375 --> 35:17.854
Long enough.

35:17.898 --> 35:20.335
You should choose your
friends more wisely.

35:20.379 --> 35:23.164
Have fun being an accomplice
to murder, sweetie.

35:23.208 --> 35:24.731
I'll have you
know it's a killer

35:24.774 --> 35:28.082
mask doing it, not my friend.

35:28.126 --> 35:30.302
Don't act like
that sounds so weird.

35:30.345 --> 35:32.304
They're right, you know.

35:32.347 --> 35:34.219
I should just kill myself.

35:34.262 --> 35:36.743
You found an evil
mask, and you put it on.

35:36.786 --> 35:39.354
What in God's name did
you think would happen?

35:39.398 --> 35:41.835
I don't need your
judgment right now, Chuck.

35:41.878 --> 35:45.404
Can you at least remember
where you found this thing?

35:52.237 --> 35:54.587
We were
scared shitless.

35:54.630 --> 35:56.241
And we'd been
looking everywhere.

35:56.284 --> 35:58.460
We even called the police.

35:58.504 --> 36:00.201
When we finally
found him, his body--

36:00.245 --> 36:02.856
or what was left of him--

36:02.899 --> 36:05.728
his body was just lying
there limp and lifeless,

36:05.772 --> 36:08.209
his eyes glazed over.

36:08.253 --> 36:13.954
We realized that Brad had gotten
so drunk that he locked himself

36:13.997 --> 36:15.869
in his car and fell asleep.

36:19.264 --> 36:19.960
Thank you.

36:20.003 --> 36:20.656
Thanks, Freddie.

36:20.700 --> 36:22.615
Thank you, Brad.

36:22.658 --> 36:24.443
All right, I'm gonna--

36:24.486 --> 36:27.010
I'm gonna tell a
different kind of story.

36:27.054 --> 36:28.490
OK?

36:28.534 --> 36:30.207
It's sort of, um-- sort
of like a history lesson.

36:30.231 --> 36:33.234
It's about this camp,
and it's all true,

36:33.278 --> 36:37.804
and it happened right
here on this very land.

36:37.847 --> 36:40.328
So long before the French
Cajuns arrived here,

36:40.372 --> 36:42.461
the natives lived in
harmony with the land.

36:42.504 --> 36:45.028
It was peaceful back then.

36:45.072 --> 36:48.249
But when the Cajun settlers
came with their gris-gris

36:48.293 --> 36:51.078
and their potions
and black magic,

36:51.121 --> 36:55.604
they awoke something,
something dark, sinister.

36:55.648 --> 36:57.824
And it struck with a vengeance.

36:57.867 --> 37:00.740
Suddenly, these Cajun settlers
started dying in the most

37:00.783 --> 37:02.829
horrific ways, right?

37:02.872 --> 37:04.265
Killing each other.

37:04.309 --> 37:05.701
Killing themselves.

37:05.745 --> 37:08.269
It went on this
way for many months

37:08.313 --> 37:12.752
till finally a, ,
a medicine man,

37:12.795 --> 37:16.843
was able to trap the dark
spirit in an old red oak tree

37:16.886 --> 37:19.628
somewhere in these woods.

37:19.672 --> 37:23.328
And there it stayed
locked up for 100 years,

37:23.371 --> 37:26.418
and people were safe.

37:26.461 --> 37:32.424
Until one winter day when a
woodcarver came upon the tree

37:32.467 --> 37:35.557
right here in these
woods and he chopped

37:35.601 --> 37:37.559
the tree down to get his wood.

37:37.603 --> 37:41.781
But something happened
'cause this woodcarver,

37:41.824 --> 37:45.306
his trade was furniture,
children's toys.

37:45.350 --> 37:49.963
But that day, something
compelled him to carve a mask.

37:50.006 --> 37:53.619
And this mask was unlike--

37:53.662 --> 37:55.751
unlike any other.

37:55.795 --> 38:00.626
It had dark empty eyes
that drank in the light,

38:00.669 --> 38:02.584
sucking the goodness
out of the world.

38:02.628 --> 38:04.760
Do we have
to listen to this?

38:04.804 --> 38:08.895
Aw, somebody's spooked.

38:08.938 --> 38:10.418
Guys, guys, listen.

38:10.462 --> 38:12.942
I'd-- I'd stop, but this
isn't just some story.

38:12.986 --> 38:14.506
This is the real
history of this place.

38:18.774 --> 38:19.969
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

38:19.993 --> 38:21.255
Wait a minute.

38:21.299 --> 38:23.953
So you're saying
you knew all along

38:23.997 --> 38:26.739
that your family's campground
had this creepy history

38:26.782 --> 38:28.958
with the evil mask?

38:29.002 --> 38:31.352
Not to sound like
a broken record,

38:31.396 --> 38:33.354
but why the hell did
you put that mask on?

38:33.398 --> 38:35.530
Would you just
listen to me please?

38:35.574 --> 38:41.580
So finally one night when the
woodcarver couldn't sleep,

38:41.623 --> 38:44.887
every night he'd
have nightmares.

38:44.931 --> 38:47.542
Said to his wife he
was hearing voices.

38:47.586 --> 38:50.632
Ever since he carved this
mask, he'd been restless.

38:50.676 --> 38:52.591
So he took it out
into the woods,

38:52.634 --> 38:54.810
and he goes to destroy the mask.

38:54.854 --> 38:58.031
And as he raises his ax,
again something compels

38:58.074 --> 39:02.252
him instead to put the mask on.

39:02.296 --> 39:05.299
And although this man was
known as the kindest person

39:05.343 --> 39:09.085
in his town, that
night he killed

39:09.129 --> 39:12.001
everybody in the village,
including his own family.

39:16.745 --> 39:19.400
There was one survivor.

39:19.444 --> 39:21.576
It was a young woman who
happened to be out butchering

39:21.620 --> 39:24.405
chickens, and when
she came back,

39:24.449 --> 39:28.061
she used the butcher's ax
to kill the woodcarver.

39:28.104 --> 39:29.410
Wow.

39:29.454 --> 39:30.324
Goosebumps.

39:30.368 --> 39:31.978
OK.

39:32.021 --> 39:34.328
But I'm telling you, ever since
this land has been plagued

39:34.372 --> 39:36.765
with all kinds of
weird accidents,

39:36.809 --> 39:38.463
unexplained deaths, murders.

39:38.506 --> 39:41.422
I'm sure you guys
have heard stories.

39:41.466 --> 39:45.861
But to this day, the evil
mask has never been found.

39:48.255 --> 39:49.561
Steve!

39:49.604 --> 39:50.953
Come on, Steve.

39:50.997 --> 39:54.348
You know we don't play
those crazy games.

39:54.392 --> 39:55.436
Crazy white boy Steve.

39:55.480 --> 39:56.481
Come on now.

39:56.524 --> 39:57.917
Yeah, so, guys, in--

39:57.960 --> 39:59.460
in all seriousness, the
murders were horrendous.

39:59.484 --> 40:02.138
So, you know, be
careful out there.

40:02.182 --> 40:05.011
And it's also true that
the mask was never found,

40:05.054 --> 40:06.795
and the legend has
it that it's buried

40:06.839 --> 40:11.278
at the woodcarver's grave, which
is somewhere on this property.

40:12.105 --> 40:13.759
OK.

40:13.802 --> 40:15.151
Let me get this right.

40:15.195 --> 40:19.460
We have a creepy mask
and a cursed grave.

40:19.504 --> 40:20.766
Two words, guys.

40:20.809 --> 40:22.942
Treasure hunt.

40:22.985 --> 40:23.943
Right?

40:23.986 --> 40:24.813
Come on.

40:24.857 --> 40:25.510
No, no, no, guys.

40:25.553 --> 40:26.554
Come on.

40:26.598 --> 40:28.121
We're gonna make this fun, Sam.

40:28.164 --> 40:29.490
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

40:29.514 --> 40:31.013
Stop being
little boys, seriously.

40:31.037 --> 40:32.493
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait wait, wait.

40:32.517 --> 40:34.475
You guys, that's not
the point of the story.

40:34.519 --> 40:36.869
Sam, I don't think
your story had a point anyway.

40:36.912 --> 40:38.174
It's a cool legend.

40:38.218 --> 40:38.827
Guys.

40:38.871 --> 40:40.481
Yeah.

40:40.525 --> 40:41.177
He was just trying to
scare us with that story.

40:41.221 --> 40:42.221
Come on, baby.

40:47.445 --> 40:48.358
Hi.

40:48.402 --> 40:49.751
Hi.

40:49.795 --> 40:52.232
Shall we go?

40:52.275 --> 40:54.016
What are you talking about?

40:54.060 --> 40:56.802
Your parents have owned this
land for how many years now?

40:56.845 --> 41:00.501
Like you don't know
where the grave is.

41:00.545 --> 41:03.504
I-- I mean, maybe.

41:04.592 --> 41:05.712
I guess I'll meet you there.

41:09.249 --> 41:11.904
No, um--

41:14.384 --> 41:17.083
I mean, I'm sorry.

41:17.126 --> 41:19.738
You know, I'm responsible
for these wackos, so.

41:19.781 --> 41:20.782
I understand.

41:20.826 --> 41:21.522
Look, I got the fire.

41:21.566 --> 41:23.002
I'm cozy.

41:23.045 --> 41:23.959
I'll just stay here.

41:24.003 --> 41:25.003
You go on.

41:28.964 --> 41:31.619
Hey, guys?

41:31.663 --> 41:32.663
Drew.

41:38.583 --> 41:39.583
Hey, Drew.

41:41.847 --> 41:42.847
Come on.

41:45.807 --> 41:47.505
This is not funny, guys.

42:17.099 --> 42:18.099
Drew?

42:21.408 --> 42:22.408
Drew?

42:39.339 --> 42:39.905
Guess who?

42:39.948 --> 42:41.733
God!

42:41.776 --> 42:42.472
Drew.

42:42.516 --> 42:44.649
Gotcha.

42:44.692 --> 42:46.607
Not funny.

42:46.651 --> 42:48.391
Come on.

42:48.435 --> 42:50.611
This place is
like creepy cool.

42:50.655 --> 42:52.787
So you didn't
actually have any idea

42:52.831 --> 42:54.702
what this was, did you?

42:54.746 --> 42:58.010
I didn't need to, did I?

43:00.839 --> 43:02.014
OK, you got me.

43:02.057 --> 43:03.057
Can we go now?

43:05.583 --> 43:06.801
Drew, come on.

43:06.845 --> 43:10.152
Let's go back to the
others, all right?

43:10.196 --> 43:11.893
Do you know if
this says anything?

43:11.937 --> 43:14.635
Yeah, it says,
"Congratulations, you found me.

43:14.679 --> 43:16.028
Now get the hell out of here."

43:17.377 --> 43:19.640
You can go brag
to everyone else.

43:19.684 --> 43:21.555
Come on, Drew.

43:21.599 --> 43:22.991
Seriously, I've
been here a bunch.

43:23.035 --> 43:24.297
It's not a big deal.

43:24.340 --> 43:25.341
There's a tree.

43:25.385 --> 43:26.665
There's a saddle, the headstone.

43:29.128 --> 43:30.128
What is this?

43:33.001 --> 43:35.874
That's the ground.

43:40.748 --> 43:41.488
Good one.

43:41.531 --> 43:44.143
What a surprise.

43:44.186 --> 43:44.970
So scared.

43:45.013 --> 43:46.013
My god.

43:48.626 --> 43:50.453
Hey, hey, don't touch that.

43:50.497 --> 43:52.020
Drew.

43:52.064 --> 43:53.389
Dude, I know the whole
first night initiation thing.

43:53.413 --> 43:54.825
I've been going to
camps since I was eight.

43:54.849 --> 43:57.025
No, this is not that, OK?

43:57.069 --> 43:58.026
Trust me, please.

43:58.070 --> 43:59.637
Can we just get out of here?

43:59.680 --> 44:04.859
Please, just put that
down, and let's go, OK?

44:04.903 --> 44:05.903
Drew, come on.

44:09.429 --> 44:12.432
Hey, don't put that on.

44:12.475 --> 44:14.739
OK.

44:14.782 --> 44:15.740
God.

44:15.783 --> 44:16.783
You put it on.

44:18.438 --> 44:19.831
Die.

44:19.874 --> 44:21.354
Kill, kill, kill.

44:21.397 --> 44:23.312
Kill.

44:23.356 --> 44:24.749
Sam.

44:24.792 --> 44:26.707
Sam.

44:26.751 --> 44:27.751
Sam.

44:34.672 --> 44:36.543
Sam.

44:42.418 --> 44:45.421
It's yours.

44:45.465 --> 44:46.465
Sam.

44:49.425 --> 44:51.384
The knife is yours.

44:51.427 --> 44:52.427
Take it.

44:55.388 --> 44:59.522
I thank you.

44:59.566 --> 45:01.916
Sam, this
isn't funny anymore.

45:01.960 --> 45:02.960
Kill.

45:04.963 --> 45:06.442
Kill, kill.

45:06.486 --> 45:08.923
Sam.

45:08.967 --> 45:11.404
Sam.

45:31.424 --> 45:34.079
OK, look, with
all this craziness,

45:34.122 --> 45:38.126
it just goes to show you that
history loves repeating itself.

45:38.170 --> 45:40.955
You know, Sleepaway
Camp and killer masks.

45:40.999 --> 45:45.743
It's like fries and gravy,
peanut butter and bananas, Mets

45:45.786 --> 45:47.919
fans and perpetual suffering.

45:47.962 --> 45:50.486
Things that go together
even though they shouldn't.

45:50.530 --> 45:51.792
Right.

45:51.836 --> 45:52.924
All right.

45:52.967 --> 45:54.534
Let me see if I
got this straight.

45:54.577 --> 45:57.929
Drew was your first kill,
and then the skinny dipper.

46:00.801 --> 46:01.584
Then what?

46:01.628 --> 46:05.632
- And then--

46:05.675 --> 46:09.244
Steve, the Kayak King.

46:09.288 --> 46:10.288
Did I forget anyone?

46:12.813 --> 46:13.988
Right.

46:14.032 --> 46:16.686
So without knowing
about the others,

46:16.730 --> 46:18.558
you've killed eight so far.

46:18.601 --> 46:19.820
Nine.

46:19.864 --> 46:21.213
Imani.

46:23.432 --> 46:25.086
OK, so nine.

46:25.130 --> 46:26.958
This is so bad.

46:27.001 --> 46:28.829
None of them deserve this.

46:28.873 --> 46:33.442
Well, I think it's
only gonna get worse.

46:33.486 --> 46:36.141
I think you're
probably gonna die.

46:36.184 --> 46:37.185
Wow.

46:37.229 --> 46:38.578
Sorry, Sam.

46:38.621 --> 46:41.276
It's just that's how
these things seem to go.

46:41.320 --> 46:44.410
On the bright side, though,
in a lot of these cases,

46:44.453 --> 46:46.673
the killer comes back
in a couple of years.

46:46.716 --> 46:48.501
You know, lightning
strikes their grave,

46:48.544 --> 46:52.635
and then they're
back from the dead.

46:52.679 --> 46:53.680
That's not funny.

46:53.723 --> 46:56.944
You know it could happen.

46:56.988 --> 46:59.642
There's got to be something
that we're missing.

46:59.686 --> 47:03.168
There's just got to be.

47:03.211 --> 47:05.866
How did Imani die?

47:05.910 --> 47:09.783
OK, after we found
Steve hanging from that tree,

47:09.827 --> 47:11.195
that's when we all
started making traps.

47:11.219 --> 47:14.179
We figured we had
to catch the killer.

47:14.222 --> 47:15.222
Catch me.

47:22.013 --> 47:23.101
Holy shit, Jamie.

47:23.144 --> 47:24.232
Did you just do that?

47:24.276 --> 47:25.233
Good job.

47:25.277 --> 47:27.148
You guys dig a lot of holes?

47:27.192 --> 47:28.889
It's not quite
the arts and crafts

47:28.933 --> 47:31.172
project I was hoping for, but
we're getting through this.

47:31.196 --> 47:34.460
You know, to be honest, I
liked last summer way better.

47:34.503 --> 47:35.503
Yeah, me too.

47:39.944 --> 47:42.642
My girlfriend and I are going
to culinary school together.

47:42.685 --> 47:47.429
That's the plan anyway
if, I get in.

47:47.473 --> 47:49.040
What are you gonna do?

47:49.083 --> 47:51.433
Marry a rich guy.

47:51.477 --> 47:52.477
Smart.

48:09.887 --> 48:12.106
Well, that works.

48:12.150 --> 48:13.716
OK.

48:13.760 --> 48:14.717
So we checked the perimeter.

48:14.761 --> 48:15.936
Everything's clear.

48:15.980 --> 48:17.174
Yeah, there's no
one in that patch,

48:17.198 --> 48:18.558
so we should be
safe for now, guys.

48:18.591 --> 48:20.003
Guys, what
was all that noise?

48:20.027 --> 48:22.247
We were just
testing the alert system.

48:22.290 --> 48:23.465
OK, good.

48:23.509 --> 48:24.902
Sam, what do we do now?

48:24.945 --> 48:28.688
Well, we've
got a secure perimeter.

48:28.731 --> 48:30.187
OK, that doesn't
answer our question.

48:30.211 --> 48:31.343
What do we do now?

48:31.386 --> 48:33.954
Well, I think now we--

48:33.998 --> 48:35.398
you know, we just
circle the wagons.

48:38.219 --> 48:39.457
You know, circle the wagons.

48:39.481 --> 48:40.743
Stay inside the safe zone.

48:40.787 --> 48:42.136
There's a killer out there.

48:42.180 --> 48:43.853
We circle the wagons,
we'll be sitting ducks.

48:43.877 --> 48:45.037
We need to go after this guy.

48:46.706 --> 48:47.185
OK.

48:47.228 --> 48:48.577
Yeah.

48:48.621 --> 48:51.058
Yeah, let's-- let's
kick it up a notch, man.

48:51.102 --> 48:55.454
Hey, why don't we combine
offense and defense?

48:55.497 --> 48:56.977
Yeah.

48:57.021 --> 48:59.327
Um, I'll-- I'll run outside
the perimeter, right?

48:59.371 --> 49:00.111
I'll run around.

49:00.154 --> 49:01.155
I'll be like bait.

49:01.199 --> 49:02.548
OK, and then the killer sees me.

49:02.591 --> 49:04.942
I'll run back, trip the alarm.

49:04.985 --> 49:06.421
He'll come in.

49:06.465 --> 49:08.902
You guys converge on him,
force him into the pit.

49:08.946 --> 49:11.426
- What?
- Y'all seen Jamie's pit?

49:11.470 --> 49:13.361
What if you end up
coming from the other direction?

49:13.385 --> 49:15.561
There's no alarm there.

49:15.604 --> 49:16.997
How many pots and pans?

49:17.041 --> 49:19.217
I can go 100 feet that
way and be a lookout.

49:19.260 --> 49:19.913
By yourself?

49:19.957 --> 49:21.567
Jamie.

49:21.610 --> 49:22.742
I'll go with her.

49:22.785 --> 49:23.937
Yeah, that
makes more sense.

49:23.961 --> 49:24.787
- Yes.
- Let's just do this.

49:24.831 --> 49:26.354
Jamie, I got you.

49:43.328 --> 49:45.048
Kill, kill, kill, kill.

49:51.205 --> 49:52.205
Sam.

49:56.645 --> 49:59.039
Sam.

49:59.083 --> 50:00.736
Wear it.

50:00.780 --> 50:03.696
Wear it.

50:03.739 --> 50:04.739
Do it, do it, do it.

50:11.747 --> 50:13.706
Kill.

50:13.749 --> 50:15.142
Kill, kill, kill.

50:15.186 --> 50:16.186
Sam.

50:26.153 --> 50:27.633
Kill.

50:27.676 --> 50:30.114
No.

50:32.638 --> 50:34.596
Sam.

50:34.640 --> 50:35.597
Now.

50:35.641 --> 50:36.598
Kill, kill.

50:36.642 --> 50:37.642
Kill.

50:41.603 --> 50:43.016
I don't think
this is a good idea.

50:43.040 --> 50:44.495
Why, 'cause
Sam didn't said so?

50:44.519 --> 50:46.173
Yeah, kinda.

50:46.217 --> 50:47.740
Well,
guess what, Nancy?

50:47.783 --> 50:49.631
You're not gonna be good
for anything if you're dead.

50:49.655 --> 50:51.372
Sam already said
it's too dangerous out there

50:51.396 --> 50:53.006
to go out in the dark.

50:53.050 --> 50:54.636
Plus, I don't wanna
just desert everybody.

50:54.660 --> 50:56.357
You're not deserting anyone.

50:56.401 --> 50:57.880
Right, you're saving yourself.

50:57.924 --> 50:59.143
I don't have time for this.

50:59.186 --> 51:00.318
I'm getting out of here.

51:55.329 --> 51:56.287
Hey, asshole.

51:56.330 --> 51:57.897
Come over here.
Come on.

52:04.121 --> 52:06.035
Come on, let's play a game.

52:15.393 --> 52:17.395
Little bit closer.

52:17.438 --> 52:18.438
Come on.

52:23.662 --> 52:26.578
There you go.

52:43.464 --> 52:44.464
Kill, kill.

52:55.259 --> 52:56.173
Hey, assface!

52:56.216 --> 52:57.957
This way, baby, come on!

52:58.000 --> 53:00.438
Die.

53:00.481 --> 53:02.396
Die.

53:02.440 --> 53:04.833
Kill her now.

53:04.877 --> 53:08.837
Kill Imani now,
now, now, now, now.

53:20.284 --> 53:21.284
Kill her.

53:35.690 --> 53:37.605
Imani!

53:49.574 --> 53:50.574
Go, go, go, go, go!

54:25.566 --> 54:27.046
My god.

54:27.089 --> 54:29.004
My god!

54:30.528 --> 54:31.442
My god!

54:31.485 --> 54:32.965
My god!

54:34.445 --> 54:35.924
My god!

54:35.968 --> 54:36.968
My god!

54:48.285 --> 54:49.242
Rings of Saturn.

54:49.286 --> 54:52.201
Chuck!

54:52.245 --> 54:55.553
This is a really
bad development, Sam.

54:55.596 --> 54:57.487
You know, I really thought
I had a chance of getting

54:57.511 --> 54:59.383
back together with Imani.

54:59.426 --> 55:00.601
What?

55:00.645 --> 55:02.516
Yeah, it's bad
that Imani is dead,

55:02.560 --> 55:05.606
but, no, I'm talking about
the other girl, Jamie.

55:05.650 --> 55:06.955
Jamie?

55:06.999 --> 55:07.999
Hold on, hold on.

55:11.960 --> 55:13.353
What's bad about Jamie?

55:13.397 --> 55:15.157
Well, the fact
that she's still alive.

55:15.181 --> 55:17.836
I mean, it's good for
her, but it's bad for you.

55:17.879 --> 55:19.707
In what sense
is that bad for me?

55:19.751 --> 55:22.623
In the sense that
she's gonna kill you.

55:22.667 --> 55:24.016
Jamie?

55:24.059 --> 55:25.757
What, are you crazy?

55:25.800 --> 55:28.160
Your friend's got
serious relationship problems.

55:28.194 --> 55:29.848
Hey, it's after midnight.

55:29.891 --> 55:33.155
How come you haven't
turned into a pumpkin?

55:33.199 --> 55:35.114
Come on.
I have to lock up.

55:35.157 --> 55:36.376
OK, what time do you open?

55:36.420 --> 55:38.987
Yeah, yeah, goodbye.

55:39.031 --> 55:41.207
Jamie's the last person
I have to worry about.

55:41.250 --> 55:42.730
Precisely.

55:42.774 --> 55:44.273
No, no, no, no, Chuck,
you don't understand.

55:44.297 --> 55:47.082
You know, Jamie-- Jamie's
like the sweetest girl

55:47.126 --> 55:48.693
on the planet.

55:48.736 --> 55:50.410
I-- I mean, you should see
her dig, but she's really,

55:50.434 --> 55:51.260
really gentle.

55:51.304 --> 55:52.610
She loves to paint.

55:52.653 --> 55:54.196
I mean, she wanted to
run arts and crafts.

55:54.220 --> 55:55.500
Haven't
you learn anything

55:55.526 --> 55:56.962
from the thousands
of hours we've

55:57.005 --> 55:58.746
spent watching horror movies?

55:58.790 --> 56:02.794
If you're the killer,
Jaime's your final girl.

56:02.837 --> 56:04.361
Final--

56:04.404 --> 56:06.164
Laurie in Halloween,
Nancy from Nightmare,

56:06.188 --> 56:07.102
Sally from Chainsaw.

56:07.146 --> 56:08.756
It happens all the time.

56:08.800 --> 56:11.411
It's-- it's always
the purest soul.

56:11.455 --> 56:14.283
It's always the last
girl to survive.

56:14.327 --> 56:16.938
Listen, Chuck, I take back
whatever I said about you

56:16.982 --> 56:18.462
over explaining stuff.

56:18.505 --> 56:20.986
Well, exposition
is my middle name.

56:21.029 --> 56:25.294
So let's say I kill Jaime.

56:25.338 --> 56:26.208
My god.

56:26.252 --> 56:28.428
I-- I can't kill Jaime.

56:28.472 --> 56:29.429
What am I talking about?

56:29.473 --> 56:31.039
This is crazy.

56:31.083 --> 56:32.365
Well, Is there anyone
left that could kill you,

56:32.389 --> 56:33.607
anyone at all?

56:33.651 --> 56:37.350
Whoever lit
that cabin on fire.

56:37.394 --> 56:38.960
That-- that could be Brad.

56:39.004 --> 56:40.788
You know, it probably
was Brad, and I don't

56:40.832 --> 56:42.399
remember killing him either.

56:42.442 --> 56:44.792
Well, as soon as you put
that mask on, he's toast.

56:44.836 --> 56:46.141
Bloody toast.

56:46.185 --> 56:47.534
That's insane.

56:47.578 --> 56:49.623
You're-- you're saying
if I put on this mask,

56:49.667 --> 56:53.975
I can kill some muscle bound
meat head like Brad, but a--

56:54.019 --> 56:56.456
a sweet girl like
Jaime's gonna kill me?

56:56.500 --> 56:58.763
Yep.

56:58.806 --> 57:00.634
Wow.

57:03.507 --> 57:05.291
There he is.

57:05.334 --> 57:07.336
All right.

57:07.380 --> 57:09.687
So let me get this straight.

57:09.730 --> 57:12.341
Only one person walks
out of here alive,

57:12.385 --> 57:13.691
and that's the most pure person.

57:13.734 --> 57:15.388
Always.

57:15.432 --> 57:16.563
And that's never the killer?

57:16.607 --> 57:17.564
No.

57:17.608 --> 57:18.913
And not just in the movies.

57:18.957 --> 57:20.480
Do you remember
Boondock Butcher?

57:20.524 --> 57:21.805
No, Chuck, I don't remember
the Boondock Butcher.

57:21.829 --> 57:23.241
A kindergarten
teacher put a stop

57:23.265 --> 57:24.982
to his killing spree,
and she must've weighed

57:25.006 --> 57:27.400
like 98 pounds soaking wet.

57:27.444 --> 57:29.446
Captain Howdy, 'member?

57:29.489 --> 57:32.536
Yeah, a nun crushed him
with the steeple bells.

57:32.579 --> 57:35.930
Meaty Face--
guess who stopped him.

57:35.974 --> 57:37.671
A paraplegic.

57:37.715 --> 57:41.632
Rolled over him again and again
with spiked wheelchair tires.

57:41.675 --> 57:43.329
Must've taken like two hours.

57:43.372 --> 57:44.741
All right, all right, enough.
Thank you.

57:44.765 --> 57:45.374
I get it.

57:45.418 --> 57:46.332
I get it.

57:46.375 --> 57:47.072
OK, Jamie's gonna kill me.

57:47.115 --> 57:47.768
That's great.

57:47.812 --> 57:48.552
That's awesome.

57:48.595 --> 57:49.901
Sorry, Sam.

57:49.944 --> 57:51.816
Of all the possible
parallel universes,

57:51.859 --> 57:53.379
you've got to live
and die in this one.

57:58.126 --> 57:59.345
What are you gonna do?

57:59.388 --> 58:00.388
Kill the bastard.

58:28.417 --> 58:31.551
No, I don't wanna kill Brad.

58:31.595 --> 58:34.119
I wish this goddamn
mask would kill me.

58:48.786 --> 58:49.613
Wait a minute.

58:49.656 --> 58:50.656
I have an idea, Chuck.

58:53.704 --> 58:54.487
Yeah.

58:54.531 --> 58:55.444
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

58:55.488 --> 58:56.528
I have a pretty good idea.

59:32.656 --> 59:34.483
Sam, what's going on?

59:34.527 --> 59:35.920
It was a bad idea, Chuck.

59:35.963 --> 59:36.790
It didn't work.

59:36.834 --> 59:38.009
It didn't work.

59:38.052 --> 59:42.622
Die you bastard!

59:49.498 --> 59:50.804
What the hell?

59:54.373 --> 59:56.288
Sam.

59:56.331 --> 59:57.724
Kill.

59:57.768 --> 59:59.378
Goddamn.

59:59.421 --> 01:00:01.641
Damn you.

01:00:01.685 --> 01:00:04.426
Sam.

01:00:04.470 --> 01:00:05.863
My god.

01:00:05.906 --> 01:00:07.734
Damn you.

01:00:07.778 --> 01:00:09.388
Damn you.

01:00:09.431 --> 01:00:10.084
Fight it, Sam.

01:00:10.128 --> 01:00:11.128
Fight it.

01:00:15.612 --> 01:00:16.438
Kill.

01:00:16.482 --> 01:00:17.918
Kill.

01:00:17.962 --> 01:00:18.702
Kill.

01:00:18.745 --> 01:00:20.442
Sam, come closer.

01:00:20.486 --> 01:00:21.443
You can do it.

01:00:21.487 --> 01:00:22.923
Closer.

01:00:22.967 --> 01:00:25.186
No.

01:00:25.230 --> 01:00:26.318
No, goddamn you.

01:00:26.361 --> 01:00:27.449
I won't put you on.

01:00:30.583 --> 01:00:33.368
God, no, no.

01:00:33.412 --> 01:00:34.412
No.

01:00:39.374 --> 01:00:40.374
No, no.

01:00:50.342 --> 01:00:51.342
You bastard.

01:00:59.438 --> 01:01:00.438
Sam.

01:01:05.270 --> 01:01:07.707
Die, asshole.

01:01:07.751 --> 01:01:09.187
No.

01:01:09.230 --> 01:01:10.230
No.

01:01:30.687 --> 01:01:32.601
No!

01:01:39.130 --> 01:01:41.567
Sam.

01:01:41.610 --> 01:01:42.829
Sam?

01:01:42.873 --> 01:01:44.570
Kill, kill, kill.

01:01:44.613 --> 01:01:45.613
Sam.

01:01:47.616 --> 01:01:48.616
Sam.

01:01:52.056 --> 01:01:53.056
Sam.

01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:29.093
It's OK.

01:02:29.136 --> 01:02:29.789
It's just me.

01:02:29.833 --> 01:02:31.095
It's just me.

01:02:32.183 --> 01:02:33.401
I thought you were dead.

01:02:33.445 --> 01:02:35.795
Yeah, I know.

01:02:35.839 --> 01:02:38.102
But, hey, I figured if
he thought I was dead,

01:02:38.145 --> 01:02:39.209
I'd be off his list, right?

01:02:39.233 --> 01:02:40.887
Give me an advantage.

01:02:40.931 --> 01:02:42.691
You-- you think he murdered
all of us here intentionally?

01:02:42.715 --> 01:02:44.717
Well, I don't know,
and I don't care.

01:02:44.761 --> 01:02:46.458
Well, how do we
get out of here?

01:02:46.501 --> 01:02:47.522
There's only one way.

01:02:47.546 --> 01:02:49.156
Over Sam's dead body.

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:50.679
Come on.

01:03:03.518 --> 01:03:04.563
Hey.

01:03:04.606 --> 01:03:07.609
There's stuff in
here we can use.

01:03:07.653 --> 01:03:09.307
Look.

01:03:09.350 --> 01:03:10.830
You can do some
damage with these.

01:03:10.874 --> 01:03:12.834
You'll be dead
before you get close enough.

01:03:18.403 --> 01:03:19.839
If I got a good
swing with this--

01:03:19.883 --> 01:03:20.963
You'll be dead if you miss.

01:03:33.113 --> 01:03:36.900
This is way too heavy.

01:03:38.945 --> 01:03:41.861
Close the door.

01:03:46.431 --> 01:03:48.825
Samuel Justin Wescott, don't
you even think about it!

01:03:52.829 --> 01:03:53.786
Stop it, man!

01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:54.830
Come on!

01:04:03.709 --> 01:04:04.144
OK.

01:04:04.188 --> 01:04:07.104
OK.

01:04:07.147 --> 01:04:08.105
No.

01:04:08.148 --> 01:04:09.584
OK.

01:04:09.628 --> 01:04:10.803
My god.
My god.

01:04:10.847 --> 01:04:11.717
My god.
My god.

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:12.718
No, no, no, no.

01:04:12.761 --> 01:04:14.720
God, what do we do?

01:04:14.763 --> 01:04:15.721
My god.

01:04:15.764 --> 01:04:16.722
My god.

01:04:16.765 --> 01:04:17.375
Hold on, look around.

01:04:17.418 --> 01:04:18.202
Look around.

01:04:18.245 --> 01:04:19.245
Find something.

01:04:23.729 --> 01:04:24.382
Think quick.

01:04:24.425 --> 01:04:25.165
Imani.

01:04:25.209 --> 01:04:27.167
Hold on.

01:04:27.211 --> 01:04:28.168
What's this?

01:04:28.212 --> 01:04:30.170
Wait.

01:04:30.214 --> 01:04:31.171
Shovel.

01:04:31.215 --> 01:04:31.824
Shovel.

01:04:31.868 --> 01:04:32.868
OK.

01:04:38.178 --> 01:04:39.136
Go, go.

01:04:39.179 --> 01:04:40.137
Come on.

01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:43.140
Let's go.

01:04:49.450 --> 01:04:51.104
There you are, Sam.

01:04:51.148 --> 01:04:52.410
Caged, no other way out.

01:04:52.453 --> 01:04:54.020
I thought you were dead.

01:04:54.064 --> 01:04:55.848
And I thought
you were a nice guy,

01:04:55.892 --> 01:04:57.502
but now I want you
to rot in hell.

01:04:57.545 --> 01:04:58.416
Let's go.

01:04:58.459 --> 01:04:59.591
No.

01:04:59.634 --> 01:05:01.201
No, no, no, no,
no, it wasn't me.

01:05:01.245 --> 01:05:02.594
It was the mask.

01:05:02.637 --> 01:05:05.118
The mask made me do it.

01:05:05.162 --> 01:05:05.989
The mask?

01:05:06.032 --> 01:05:07.642
Yes, yes, Jaime.

01:05:07.686 --> 01:05:12.386
Jaime, I swear, I swear I
have fought with every fiber

01:05:12.430 --> 01:05:13.910
of my being against it.

01:05:13.953 --> 01:05:14.823
You're such a liar.

01:05:14.867 --> 01:05:15.955
No, I-- I promise.

01:05:15.999 --> 01:05:17.130
I've struggled!

01:05:17.174 --> 01:05:19.393
You kept your phone.

01:05:19.437 --> 01:05:20.438
What?

01:05:20.481 --> 01:05:21.178
We had to lock our phones up.

01:05:21.221 --> 01:05:21.918
You kept yours.

01:05:21.961 --> 01:05:22.962
It's my camp.

01:05:23.006 --> 01:05:24.355
I'm responsible for everyone.

01:05:24.398 --> 01:05:26.115
I have to have my phone
in case of an emergency.

01:05:26.139 --> 01:05:28.228
It's selfish and two-faced.

01:05:28.272 --> 01:05:30.970
Letting people think you're
dead is pretty damn selfish.

01:05:31.014 --> 01:05:31.710
Really?

01:05:31.753 --> 01:05:32.363
Is that right?

01:05:32.406 --> 01:05:34.278
Yeah, yeah.

01:05:34.321 --> 01:05:37.542
I was heartbroken enough
when you dumped me.

01:05:37.585 --> 01:05:38.586
OK?

01:05:38.630 --> 01:05:40.284
It wasn't just a summer fling.

01:05:40.327 --> 01:05:43.417
You-- you don't think I
wouldn't care if you were dead?

01:05:43.461 --> 01:05:44.592
You tried to kill me!

01:05:44.636 --> 01:05:45.898
I was not trying
to kill anyone!

01:05:45.942 --> 01:05:47.334
Yes, you were!

01:05:47.378 --> 01:05:48.857
My god.

01:05:48.901 --> 01:05:50.598
Look, look, look.

01:05:50.642 --> 01:05:54.254
You know me better than anyone,
except maybe my friend Chuck.

01:05:54.298 --> 01:05:55.821
You know I'm telling the truth.

01:05:55.864 --> 01:05:59.085
I could never do these
things that I've been doing.

01:05:59.129 --> 01:06:03.350
This-- this thing
makes me do them.

01:06:03.394 --> 01:06:05.570
It-- it's the story
that I told you.

01:06:05.613 --> 01:06:07.746
It has some awful power
when you put it on.

01:06:07.789 --> 01:06:11.054
Its evil takes hold of you.

01:06:11.097 --> 01:06:13.012
The legend is true.

01:06:13.056 --> 01:06:15.536
If you knew the legend was
true, why'd you put it on?

01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:17.321
That's the thing!

01:06:17.364 --> 01:06:20.977
I didn't put it on.

01:06:21.020 --> 01:06:22.674
Drew did.

01:06:22.717 --> 01:06:23.631
Yeah.

01:06:23.675 --> 01:06:25.546
Drew put it on me.

01:06:25.590 --> 01:06:26.460
Drew.

01:06:26.504 --> 01:06:27.809
Yes.

01:06:27.853 --> 01:06:29.072
Yes.

01:06:29.115 --> 01:06:32.684
We found it at the
woodcarver's grave.

01:06:32.727 --> 01:06:34.729
What were you doing with
Drew alone in a forest?

01:06:34.773 --> 01:06:36.427
Jesus.

01:06:36.470 --> 01:06:39.038
It would've been nothing if
you didn't have your dumb let's

01:06:39.082 --> 01:06:41.127
go on a treasure hunt idea.

01:06:41.171 --> 01:06:44.043
You know, Jamie, one
could make the argument

01:06:44.087 --> 01:06:46.263
that this whole mess
is Imani's fault.

01:06:46.306 --> 01:06:46.915
My fault?

01:06:46.959 --> 01:06:47.959
Yes.

01:06:48.917 --> 01:06:50.615
I'm not the one
with the crazy knife,

01:06:50.658 --> 01:06:52.201
and I'm not the one who mistakes
a summer fling with something--

01:06:52.225 --> 01:06:53.463
It was more than
a summer fling!

01:06:53.487 --> 01:06:54.662
You guys!

01:06:54.706 --> 01:06:57.013
This is not the time.

01:06:57.056 --> 01:06:59.972
Sam, you need to
promise no more killing.

01:07:00.016 --> 01:07:01.452
No more killing.

01:07:01.495 --> 01:07:04.107
I swear.

01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:06.805
Look, I need you guys to stay
alive so I can stay alive.

01:07:06.848 --> 01:07:08.328
I'm not following
your logic, Sam.

01:07:08.372 --> 01:07:10.504
Look, I've been
talking to my friend Chuck,

01:07:10.548 --> 01:07:12.158
and she says the
way these things

01:07:12.202 --> 01:07:15.727
always go is that it's the
final girl who kills the killer.

01:07:15.770 --> 01:07:20.123
So as long as you two
are alive, you know?

01:07:20.166 --> 01:07:21.211
No final girl.

01:07:21.254 --> 01:07:22.864
We-- we all stay safe.

01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:28.696
Your friend must be
as crazy as you are.

01:07:32.222 --> 01:07:33.179
Hold on.

01:07:33.223 --> 01:07:34.311
OK.

01:07:34.354 --> 01:07:36.226
Here we go.

01:07:42.101 --> 01:07:45.365
Sometimes she doesn't
pick up right away.

01:07:54.766 --> 01:07:55.375
Sam?

01:07:55.419 --> 01:07:56.681
Chuck!

01:07:56.724 --> 01:07:57.377
Hey.

01:07:57.421 --> 01:07:58.944
God.

01:07:58.987 --> 01:07:59.814
Are you OK?

01:07:59.858 --> 01:08:01.164
Yes.

01:08:01.207 --> 01:08:03.035
Well, no, I'm-- I'm
locked up, but that's--

01:08:03.079 --> 01:08:04.384
I'm still kicking.

01:08:04.428 --> 01:08:05.733
I panicked.

01:08:05.777 --> 01:08:07.605
I-- I-- I called the
sheriff by the camp.

01:08:07.648 --> 01:08:08.475
Yeah?

01:08:08.519 --> 01:08:09.694
Left a voicemail.

01:08:09.737 --> 01:08:11.478
God, he
should just retire.

01:08:12.218 --> 01:08:13.393
Um, hey, Chuck.

01:08:13.437 --> 01:08:15.047
This is, Imani,
Sam's friend.

01:08:16.179 --> 01:08:16.962
Hi.

01:08:17.005 --> 01:08:18.224
So, Chuck, I--

01:08:18.268 --> 01:08:20.008
I need you to back
me up here and tell

01:08:20.051 --> 01:08:23.359
these ladies about this whole
final girl thing because I'm--

01:08:23.403 --> 01:08:25.144
I'm looking pretty
crazy right now.

01:08:25.188 --> 01:08:26.450
Ladies?

01:08:26.493 --> 01:08:28.234
Jamie, she's there too?

01:08:28.278 --> 01:08:30.149
Yeah, yeah, Jamie.
Jamie.

01:08:30.193 --> 01:08:32.108
Chuck, Jamie, Jamie, Chuck.

01:08:32.151 --> 01:08:33.370
Yeah, yeah, Jamie's here.

01:08:33.412 --> 01:08:35.981
Um, Jamie hit me with a shovel.

01:08:36.024 --> 01:08:36.808
OK.

01:08:36.850 --> 01:08:38.375
OK, um, well, yeah.

01:08:38.417 --> 01:08:43.684
First of all, ladies,
I know this is all insane.

01:08:43.728 --> 01:08:45.207
Just bear with me for a minute.

01:08:45.251 --> 01:08:49.689
But, OK, whatever you
do, do not let Sam put

01:08:49.734 --> 01:08:52.606
the mask on his face again, OK?

01:08:52.649 --> 01:08:57.481
The mask is responsible
for all this, not Sam.

01:08:57.524 --> 01:09:00.265
And, second, in
situations like this,

01:09:00.310 --> 01:09:04.314
in the paranormal or when
there's a lunatic on the loose

01:09:04.357 --> 01:09:09.754
or whatever, there's usually
a pure and innocent girl,

01:09:09.796 --> 01:09:13.975
you know, the-- the final
one alive that usually--

01:09:14.019 --> 01:09:18.023
the final girl that--
that saves the day.

01:09:18.066 --> 01:09:20.460
Sam.

01:09:20.504 --> 01:09:21.939
Sam.

01:09:21.983 --> 01:09:23.898
Kill.

01:09:23.942 --> 01:09:24.421
Come on.

01:09:24.464 --> 01:09:26.814
Do it.

01:09:26.858 --> 01:09:29.774
And, Jamie, from
what Sam says,

01:09:29.817 --> 01:09:31.210
that-- that sounds like you.

01:09:34.038 --> 01:09:35.562
No offense, Imani.

01:09:43.483 --> 01:09:45.442
Guys.

01:09:45.484 --> 01:09:48.923
What's happening?

01:09:48.966 --> 01:09:51.448
Um, Sam's
getting the mask.

01:09:51.491 --> 01:09:53.798
Guys, run.

01:09:53.841 --> 01:09:56.235
Run!

01:10:15.385 --> 01:10:17.822
Do you know
where we're going?

01:10:17.865 --> 01:10:19.258
Nope.

01:10:19.302 --> 01:10:20.607
I know where you're going.

01:10:20.651 --> 01:10:22.348
Imani, what the
hell are you doing?

01:10:22.392 --> 01:10:23.871
We're not gonna
be able to stop him.

01:10:23.915 --> 01:10:25.501
Well, it's not gonna
help if you turn on me.

01:10:25.525 --> 01:10:27.527
I'm not sure
there's much either of you

01:10:27.571 --> 01:10:30.182
can do to alter the
course of these events.

01:10:30.226 --> 01:10:31.836
So it goes.

01:10:31.879 --> 01:10:34.360
No, Chuck, we can make
this happen any kind of way.

01:10:34.404 --> 01:10:36.382
And I know I'm more equipped
to kill Sam than Little

01:10:36.406 --> 01:10:37.798
Miss Perfect over here.

01:10:37.842 --> 01:10:40.497
OK, this isn't
a logic problem, Imani.

01:10:40.540 --> 01:10:44.283
No matter how strong or
smart you think you are,

01:10:44.327 --> 01:10:47.852
no matter how determined,
you just can't outplay this.

01:10:47.895 --> 01:10:51.595
There's just no way that
you're the pure soul that

01:10:51.638 --> 01:10:53.379
survives at the end of the day.

01:10:53.423 --> 01:10:54.119
I'm sorry.

01:10:54.162 --> 01:10:55.468
You just aren't.

01:10:55.512 --> 01:10:56.991
Yeah?

01:10:57.035 --> 01:10:58.317
Well, there's more to
purity than meets the eye,

01:10:58.341 --> 01:11:00.256
and I know she's not
this perfect image

01:11:00.299 --> 01:11:01.387
she shows everybody.

01:11:06.827 --> 01:11:07.827
Do you party?

01:11:10.353 --> 01:11:13.791
- Why?
- Drugs, alcohol, caffeine even?

01:11:13.834 --> 01:11:14.661
No.

01:11:14.705 --> 01:11:16.141
Just face it, Imani.

01:11:16.184 --> 01:11:17.360
You're not a virgin, are you?

01:11:17.403 --> 01:11:18.709
That's personal.

01:11:18.752 --> 01:11:20.295
Yeah, so is
life and death, baby.

01:11:20.319 --> 01:11:21.451
And it's down to me and you.

01:11:21.494 --> 01:11:22.734
- So are you a virgin?
- Yes!

01:11:25.977 --> 01:11:27.370
Are you happy now?

01:11:27.413 --> 01:11:29.023
Nope.

01:11:29.067 --> 01:11:33.854
'Cause that mean Chuck was
right, and you.

01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:54.048
What's-- what's going on?

01:11:54.092 --> 01:11:55.441
Hello?

01:11:55.485 --> 01:11:56.897
Imani bought into
what you were saying.

01:11:56.921 --> 01:11:58.879
What did you do?

01:11:58.923 --> 01:12:00.794
I acted first.

01:12:00.838 --> 01:12:02.666
OK.

01:12:02.709 --> 01:12:03.797
What do I do now?

01:12:08.149 --> 01:12:12.153
You-- you've got to kill Sam.

01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:18.377
He's right there.

01:12:18.421 --> 01:12:19.813
Sam?

01:12:19.857 --> 01:12:20.423
Sam?

01:12:20.466 --> 01:12:21.337
Hello?

01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:22.642
He's got the mask on.

01:12:22.686 --> 01:12:24.209
Then you
should be running.

01:12:24.252 --> 01:12:25.950
No.

01:12:25.993 --> 01:12:27.908
I have to end this.
Now.

01:12:34.741 --> 01:12:36.047
How are you gonna do that?

01:12:36.090 --> 01:12:37.178
I have a shovel.

01:12:37.222 --> 01:12:38.702
No.

01:12:38.745 --> 01:12:40.965
No, you can't possibly
take out evil this powerful

01:12:41.008 --> 01:12:42.270
with a shovel.

01:12:42.314 --> 01:12:43.315
I'm sorry.

01:12:43.359 --> 01:12:44.403
You're just not.

01:12:44.447 --> 01:12:46.100
Then what am I supposed to do?

01:12:46.144 --> 01:12:48.364
You have to meet
him on-- on the right field

01:12:48.407 --> 01:12:49.234
of battle.

01:12:49.277 --> 01:12:50.104
What does that mean?

01:12:50.148 --> 01:12:51.845
A place of power.

01:12:51.889 --> 01:12:53.020
What?

01:12:53.064 --> 01:12:53.978
OK.

01:12:54.021 --> 01:12:55.458
You-- you know at my work?

01:12:55.501 --> 01:12:58.330
The woodcarver's grave,
where Sam found the mask.

01:12:58.374 --> 01:12:59.679
Just go there.

01:12:59.723 --> 01:13:01.115
I don't know where that is.

01:13:01.159 --> 01:13:02.334
OK.

01:13:02.378 --> 01:13:04.858
After Sam killed
Drew, he-- he--

01:13:04.902 --> 01:13:07.252
he killed Ted and Allison
in a swimming pool.

01:13:07.295 --> 01:13:11.256
So-- so the grave must be
around there somewhere.

01:13:11.299 --> 01:13:12.299
Run!

01:13:17.958 --> 01:13:19.196
Kill, kill, kill.

01:13:31.407 --> 01:13:32.407
Kill, kill.

01:13:38.283 --> 01:13:40.720
Kill.

01:13:53.254 --> 01:13:54.254
Sam?

01:13:58.695 --> 01:14:00.653
Hello?

01:14:00.697 --> 01:14:02.655
Sam?

01:14:02.699 --> 01:14:05.136
Sam?

01:14:32.076 --> 01:14:33.512
Sam?

01:14:33.556 --> 01:14:36.036
Sam.

01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:37.516
Hello?

01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:38.560
Hello?

01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:41.999
Chuck.

01:14:42.042 --> 01:14:43.304
Sam?

01:14:43.348 --> 01:14:45.524
I think I can
conquer this thing.

01:14:45.568 --> 01:14:47.700
OK.

01:14:47.744 --> 01:14:50.573
I don't have to kill Jamie.

01:14:50.616 --> 01:14:51.661
OK.

01:14:51.704 --> 01:14:52.812
And she doesn't
have to kill me.

01:14:52.836 --> 01:14:56.143
No, I know, OK.

01:14:56.187 --> 01:14:58.058
I know you think
it's inevitable.

01:15:00.757 --> 01:15:04.412
But I'm gonna take this mask
back to the woodcarver's grave,

01:15:04.456 --> 01:15:06.371
and I'm gonna end this.

01:15:06.414 --> 01:15:07.720
Sam, you know what?

01:15:07.764 --> 01:15:09.306
I-- I have some more
old books in the back,

01:15:09.330 --> 01:15:11.637
like more arcane stuff.

01:15:11.681 --> 01:15:14.640
Maybe I can-- I can find
a spell or something?

01:15:14.684 --> 01:15:15.946
There's no time.

01:15:15.989 --> 01:15:17.687
Well, can you
give me like just

01:15:17.730 --> 01:15:19.384
five minutes or something?

01:15:19.427 --> 01:15:21.580
I'm not sure how much longer
I can hold this power off.

01:15:21.604 --> 01:15:23.885
No, no, just-- just
give me like five more minutes.

01:15:26.783 --> 01:15:28.219
Hello?

01:15:28.262 --> 01:15:29.699
Sam.

01:15:29.742 --> 01:15:31.222
Hello?

01:16:11.915 --> 01:16:12.915
Jamie.

01:16:13.438 --> 01:16:14.439
Sam!

01:16:14.482 --> 01:16:15.614
Get away from me.

01:16:15.658 --> 01:16:16.397
OK.

01:16:16.441 --> 01:16:17.964
It's me.
No mask.

01:16:18.008 --> 01:16:19.444
I don't trust you.

01:16:19.487 --> 01:16:21.272
You're sick freak.

01:16:25.711 --> 01:16:26.930
But you have to believe me.

01:16:26.973 --> 01:16:27.800
How can I?

01:16:27.844 --> 01:16:29.628
See, I've got the mask.

01:16:29.672 --> 01:16:30.672
But to stop it--

01:16:35.460 --> 01:16:37.027
see, I think I know
how to stop it.

01:16:40.378 --> 01:16:42.075
The woodcarver's
grave is that way.

01:16:44.774 --> 01:16:45.774
I'm going.

01:16:48.212 --> 01:16:50.214
You don't have to come with me.

01:17:04.054 --> 01:17:05.454
I'm not letting
you out of my sight.

01:17:08.885 --> 01:17:09.885
OK.

01:17:19.635 --> 01:17:20.331
Hey.

01:17:20.374 --> 01:17:21.201
OK.

01:17:21.245 --> 01:17:23.160
Look, all right, this--

01:17:23.203 --> 01:17:27.077
this is where we found the mask.

01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:29.514
And-- and I think--

01:17:29.557 --> 01:17:31.157
I think this is where
we need to bury it.

01:17:34.475 --> 01:17:36.347
Now it's-- it's OK.

01:17:36.390 --> 01:17:38.044
Nothing's gonna happen.

01:17:38.088 --> 01:17:40.786
We can end this right now.

01:17:40.830 --> 01:17:43.833
We can both walk out
of here together.

01:17:43.876 --> 01:17:48.228
We just need to put
this in the ground.

01:17:48.272 --> 01:17:51.275
I was gonna do it
myself, but I just

01:17:51.318 --> 01:17:55.453
don't think I should
be near this thing

01:17:55.496 --> 01:17:59.196
any longer than I have to be.

01:17:59.239 --> 01:18:04.549
I don't even think we should
be seeing each other anymore.

01:18:04.592 --> 01:18:05.811
OK?

01:18:05.855 --> 01:18:08.858
Now let's put that
shovel to good use.

01:18:08.901 --> 01:18:10.207
All right, all right.

01:18:14.298 --> 01:18:15.298
OK.

01:18:21.261 --> 01:18:23.176
Thank you, Jamie.

01:18:23.220 --> 01:18:24.220
Thank you.

01:18:26.353 --> 01:18:27.006
That's right.

01:18:27.050 --> 01:18:27.659
That's right.

01:18:27.703 --> 01:18:29.052
Just dig.

01:18:29.095 --> 01:18:30.314
Doesn't have to be too deep.

01:18:30.357 --> 01:18:32.011
You know, it's not--

01:18:32.055 --> 01:18:33.621
sorry.

01:18:33.665 --> 01:18:35.362
You know what you're doing.

01:18:35.406 --> 01:18:37.800
You have a gift, Jamie.

01:18:37.843 --> 01:18:40.150
I'm lucky to have you--

01:18:40.193 --> 01:18:42.108
I'm lucky to have
you here doing this.

01:18:55.861 --> 01:18:58.255
Maybe don't touch
it either, right?

01:18:58.298 --> 01:18:59.449
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:18:59.473 --> 01:19:02.433
Just, um-- maybe
just dump it out.

01:19:02.476 --> 01:19:05.871
Just-- just just
shake it out, OK?

01:19:05.915 --> 01:19:07.481
I don't even think
I should see it.

01:19:07.525 --> 01:19:10.093
Jesus.

01:19:10.136 --> 01:19:12.965
Grab my keys.

01:19:13.009 --> 01:19:13.923
God.

01:19:13.966 --> 01:19:15.663
Is it out?

01:19:15.707 --> 01:19:16.947
I don't think I have much time.

01:19:30.983 --> 01:19:31.941
Put it on.

01:19:31.984 --> 01:19:35.466
Put it on.

01:19:35.509 --> 01:19:36.467
Do it.

01:19:36.510 --> 01:19:38.164
Do it now.

01:19:38.208 --> 01:19:39.881
All right, and just let me
know when you're done because I

01:19:39.905 --> 01:19:41.385
don't want to risk seeing it.

01:19:41.428 --> 01:19:42.255
All right?

01:19:42.299 --> 01:19:43.561
You just let me know.

01:19:43.604 --> 01:19:44.844
Put it on.

01:19:49.045 --> 01:19:50.524
You good?

01:19:50.568 --> 01:19:52.135
How you doing?

01:19:52.178 --> 01:19:54.746
Just an appropriate size hole.

01:20:01.579 --> 01:20:05.801
Put it in the hole and bury it.

01:20:05.844 --> 01:20:07.585
Right?

01:20:07.628 --> 01:20:10.022
Then we'll be done.

01:20:10.066 --> 01:20:11.415
We'll be done.

01:20:11.458 --> 01:20:13.678
Now you just let me
know when you're done.

01:20:13.721 --> 01:20:17.769
Just tap me on the shoulder or
just whistle or-- or something

01:20:17.813 --> 01:20:20.685
so I don't risk look--
looking at it, OK?

01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:28.258
Jamie?

01:20:28.301 --> 01:20:29.301
Are you done?

01:20:35.743 --> 01:20:36.743
Jaime?

01:21:26.446 --> 01:21:27.012
Hello?

01:21:27.056 --> 01:21:28.056
Sam?

01:21:30.755 --> 01:21:31.712
It's over.

01:21:31.756 --> 01:21:33.932
I finished it.

01:21:36.543 --> 01:21:39.416
OK.

01:21:39.459 --> 01:21:42.071
May he rest in peace.

01:21:42.114 --> 01:21:43.114
Bye, Chuck.

01:22:15.147 --> 01:22:17.410
Sam,
Sheriff James here.

01:22:17.454 --> 01:22:19.543
Just got in the office
and I heard your voicemail

01:22:19.586 --> 01:22:21.327
and your friend's too.

01:22:21.371 --> 01:22:23.242
Look, I know you kids
love messing around,

01:22:23.286 --> 01:22:25.810
but I don't think that land's
something to joke about.

01:22:25.853 --> 01:22:28.769
Things have been good out there
since your family took over,

01:22:28.813 --> 01:22:30.641
and I can't imagine
you doing anything

01:22:30.684 --> 01:22:32.556
to screw that up, right?

01:22:32.599 --> 01:22:34.186
My granddaughter will
be at camp this year,

01:22:34.210 --> 01:22:36.821
so keep an eye on her.

01:22:36.864 --> 01:22:38.494
I'll be sure to come by
and make sure everyone's

01:22:38.518 --> 01:22:39.998
staying out of trouble.

01:22:40.042 --> 01:22:41.521
Bye, Sam.

01:23:23.911 --> 01:23:24.825
Rings of Saturn.

01:23:24.869 --> 01:23:26.044
This is Chuck.

01:23:26.088 --> 01:23:27.132
Chuck!

01:23:48.110 --> 01:23:51.069
I was
on the hunt for blood.

01:23:51.113 --> 01:23:53.985
You were feeling lost in love.

01:23:54.029 --> 01:23:59.991
All it took was just one
look and you were into me.

01:24:00.035 --> 01:24:02.994
I wish that I
could cut you free.

01:24:03.038 --> 01:24:05.953
But you're already in too deep.

01:24:05.997 --> 01:24:10.436
You feel the curiosity
of what we could be.

01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:13.439
Baby, if it's on,
don't hesitate.

01:24:13.483 --> 01:24:16.442
I promise you I'll
be your best mistake.

01:24:16.486 --> 01:24:17.922
You found me for a reason.

01:24:17.965 --> 01:24:19.358
Call it fate.

01:24:19.402 --> 01:24:22.405
Call-- call it fate.
'Cause it's feeling great.

01:24:22.448 --> 01:24:25.408
The night's about to get real.

01:24:25.451 --> 01:24:28.411
We're going in for the kill.

01:24:28.454 --> 01:24:29.934
This is power.

01:24:29.977 --> 01:24:32.371
It's not cold-hearted.

01:24:32.415 --> 01:24:35.896
And we're just getting started.

01:24:35.940 --> 01:24:38.899
We've been having so much fun.

01:24:38.943 --> 01:24:41.902
This night's been a thriller.

01:24:41.946 --> 01:24:44.862
Don't think about
what we've done.

01:24:44.905 --> 01:24:47.865
You might be the killer.

01:24:47.908 --> 01:24:50.868
You can take your hands off me.

01:24:50.911 --> 01:24:53.871
This night's been a thriller.

01:24:53.914 --> 01:24:56.874
As long as you see what I see.

01:24:56.917 --> 01:24:59.833
You might be the killer.

01:24:59.877 --> 01:25:02.836
We've been having so much fun.

01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:05.839
This night's been a thriller.

01:25:05.883 --> 01:25:08.842
Don't think about
what we've done.

01:25:08.886 --> 01:25:12.324
You might be the killer.

01:25:12.368 --> 01:25:14.805
You can take your hands off me.

01:25:14.848 --> 01:25:17.808
This night's been a thriller.

01:25:17.851 --> 01:25:20.811
As long as you see what I see.

01:25:20.854 --> 01:25:24.293
You might be the killer.

01:25:24.336 --> 01:25:30.081
Baby, after just one touch,
I knew I'd never get enough.

01:25:30.125 --> 01:25:36.087
You should know I like it rough,
but you'll get used to me.

01:25:36.131 --> 01:25:39.090
Baby, you can count me dead.

01:25:39.134 --> 01:25:42.093
Sleep by all the
things you said.

01:25:42.137 --> 01:25:48.055
But, baby, you look good in
red, so just keep killing me.

01:25:48.099 --> 01:25:50.754
We've been having so much fun.

01:25:50.797 --> 01:25:53.757
This night's been a thriller.

01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:56.760
Don't think about
what we've done.

01:25:56.803 --> 01:26:00.067
You might be the killer.

01:26:00.111 --> 01:26:02.766
You can take your hands off me.

01:26:02.809 --> 01:26:06.073
This night's been a thriller.

01:26:06.117 --> 01:26:08.772
As long as you see what I see.

01:26:08.815 --> 01:26:10.165
You might be the killer.

01:26:14.821 --> 01:26:16.171
You might be the killer.

01:26:21.132 --> 01:26:22.372
And we're just getting started.

01:26:36.103 --> 01:26:38.758
We've been having so much fun.

01:26:38.802 --> 01:26:41.761
This night's been a thriller.

01:26:41.805 --> 01:26:44.764
