17:00.937 --> 17:02.553
What's up, LA?

17:02.605 --> 17:06.315
I am the Boulevard's premiere
multimedia entertainer,

17:06.358 --> 17:08.976
and extreme performance artist
here to astonish you...

17:09.028 --> 17:10.984
and leave you breathless.
Alright?

17:11.030 --> 17:13.521
Now, my name is Todd...

17:13.574 --> 17:17.318
but some folks, they call me Todd the God.
Alright? [Laughs]

17:17.369 --> 17:19.703
And I'm about to blow your minds, alright?

17:19.789 --> 17:22.372
Now you all came to see
an amazing show, right?

17:22.458 --> 17:23.618
[Cheering] Yeah!

17:23.667 --> 17:25.579
Alright, now before I prove to you

17:25.627 --> 17:28.040
that I am the most hardcore
illusionist on the Boulevard,

17:28.089 --> 17:32.129
can I please get some brave soul to
test this nail for me

17:32.176 --> 17:34.133
to prove it's not a fake?

17:35.596 --> 17:37.508
Shh! Shh!

17:37.598 --> 17:40.557
Is that the "Quine"?

17:40.643 --> 17:44.887
[Todd] You heard it hear, folks.
It's real... and it's hard.

17:44.981 --> 17:48.315
[Cackles] Alright.

17:50.111 --> 17:52.444
- [Todd groans]
- [Crowd gasps]

17:52.488 --> 17:54.150
[Groaning]

17:56.033 --> 17:58.821
[Grunting]

17:59.537 --> 18:01.779
- [Screaming]
- [Girl screams]

18:02.707 --> 18:04.744
[Cheering]

18:04.792 --> 18:07.284
[Todd] Oh, yeah! Ha-ha!

18:08.170 --> 18:10.082
Man, I love this shit!

18:10.214 --> 18:12.672
Whoo! Come on, come on,
get your money out.

18:12.717 --> 18:14.069
Right now. Money in these buckets.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.676
Come on, look at this. Ah...

18:16.721 --> 18:19.964
There we go, keep 'em coming.
Keep 'em coming. Come on.

18:20.016 --> 18:22.599
This is one-of-a-kind
entertainment right here.

18:22.643 --> 18:26.057
Right on the streets of Hollywood!
Todd the God, baby!

18:26.105 --> 18:27.812
Whoo!

18:27.857 --> 18:30.440
- Man, is this really it?
- How about that, motherfucker?

18:30.526 --> 18:32.438
I'm doing all the fucking dangerous work.

18:32.570 --> 18:35.608
- Fuck you, Slim!
- Oh, yeah? Huh?

18:35.656 --> 18:39.320
- Yeah, go fuck yourself.
- Good luck, you fucking pussy!

18:39.452 --> 18:41.034
- Fuck off!
- Piece of shit.

18:42.830 --> 18:44.787
Fucking bullshi... Hey, Moose!

18:44.874 --> 18:47.662
Hey, man, why the rush?
Sorry about Slim's behavior.

18:47.752 --> 18:50.039
I gotta go, Todd.
I'm meeting with Hunter Dunbar.

18:50.087 --> 18:53.205
- Hunter Dumbbell, huh?
- Hunter Dunbar!

18:53.257 --> 18:55.340
He happens to be the best
actor on the planet.

18:55.384 --> 18:56.862
OK, well, why haven't you
introduced me, Moose?

18:56.886 --> 18:59.299
I don't even know him yet, Todd.

18:59.347 --> 19:02.090
We can do that later.
Right now, I gotta proposition for you.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.882
Slim and I, we just ended our partnership,

19:03.934 --> 19:06.642
and I want you to fill in for him.
Alright?

19:06.687 --> 19:08.804
- I don't want to.
- Look, it's easy, OK?

19:08.856 --> 19:11.644
I do all the hard work
hypnotizing the masses,

19:11.692 --> 19:12.961
you just need to pick a couple pockets.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.942
I don't want to, Todd!

19:14.987 --> 19:18.697
You don't respect the Boulevard and
you don't respect the fans.

19:18.741 --> 19:21.654
- And I don't steal from people.
- People? People?

19:21.702 --> 19:25.161
They're not people, Moose!
They're fucking tourists!

19:26.791 --> 19:29.955
- Moose, where you been?
- It's not over yet, is it?

19:30.002 --> 19:32.289
Relax, relax. We've gotta get you in line.

19:32.338 --> 19:35.547
- Have you got the vest?
- I sure do. Is he gonna sign?

19:35.633 --> 19:38.125
- Is he gonna sign?
- Moose, shh.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.794
- Go right in.
- Yo, man, chill.

19:40.846 --> 19:42.803
- I'm sorry.
- What the hell?

19:42.848 --> 19:46.137
- I got Vis a Vis markers.
- Yeah, great. Cool.

19:46.185 --> 19:47.847
- You can use one if you want.
- Awesome.

19:47.895 --> 19:49.887
[Hunter] Who am I making this out to?

19:49.939 --> 19:52.898
- [Woman] It's, uh, Alex.
- Alex. Alex.

19:52.942 --> 19:56.481
"To... Alex, best wishes..."

19:58.364 --> 20:00.401
- There you go.
- Thanks.

20:47.538 --> 20:49.029
- [Slams book shut]
- Thank you.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.492
[Man] Thank you. Have a good day.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.415
[Hunter] Thanks for coming by.

20:52.460 --> 20:55.544
Excuse me, Mr. Dunbar.
There's a woman named Brenda out back?

20:55.588 --> 20:57.375
She says she needs to speak to you.

20:58.549 --> 21:00.461
Says it's important. I don't know.

21:00.509 --> 21:02.000
OK.

21:02.052 --> 21:04.965
- Alright.
- It's just out back over here.

21:05.014 --> 21:07.256
Excuse me.

21:08.517 --> 21:10.429
- Aaron, he's leaving.
- Oh, Moo...

21:10.478 --> 21:11.935
- Is he gonna sign?
- Moose...

21:11.979 --> 21:13.936
- Aaron, he's leaving.
- Moose, it's OK.

21:13.981 --> 21:16.815
- Is he gonna sign?
- Moose, he's gonna sign.

21:16.859 --> 21:20.603
- Oh.
- [Breathing heavily]

21:20.654 --> 21:22.987
[Footsteps approaching]

21:26.619 --> 21:28.030
Hey, buddy.

21:31.832 --> 21:33.414
What the hell you doing here?

21:33.459 --> 21:35.951
Maybe you could remember that I
have date tonight.

21:36.003 --> 21:37.915
- You said you'd watch Tanner.
- [Door closes]

21:37.963 --> 21:39.829
- Tonight?
- [Moose] Mr. Dunbar?

21:39.882 --> 21:41.464
- Look, I messed up.
- Mr. Dunbar.

21:41.509 --> 21:44.627
I was the next fan in line.
I think you forgot.

21:44.678 --> 21:46.840
Just... just take it easy, buddy.
Take it easy.

21:46.889 --> 21:48.533
- I sure will.
- Just give me a minute, OK?

21:48.557 --> 21:51.345
I sure will. Thank you, Mr. Dunbar.

21:53.270 --> 21:56.058
You thought it was OK to bring him here?

21:56.106 --> 21:58.018
It's not OK.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.609
OK, alright. OK. OK.

22:01.654 --> 22:03.987
I'm... I'm sorry. I fucked up.

22:04.031 --> 22:06.023
[Softly] Yeah.

22:06.075 --> 22:07.941
Clearly this means a lot to you.

22:08.577 --> 22:10.193
Clearly.

22:10.246 --> 22:11.953
You know what I'm gonna do?

22:11.997 --> 22:13.909
Tomorrow I'm gonna call you

22:13.958 --> 22:17.372
and you can unload whatever it is you
want to unload on me.

22:18.504 --> 22:21.292
Get it all off your chest, OK?

22:21.340 --> 22:25.960
[Laughs] You're so full of shit, Hunter.

22:27.012 --> 22:28.969
But you're a great actor.

22:29.014 --> 22:31.176
- [Engine starts]
- You got thirty minutes.

22:31.267 --> 22:33.224
[Hunter] Fuck!

22:35.396 --> 22:37.103
I'm on your side.

22:37.147 --> 22:40.060
You're the best, Mr. Dunbar.
You're the best.

22:40.109 --> 22:42.101
You need to learn some
fucking manners, buddy.

22:42.194 --> 22:43.776
I'm sorry, Mr. Dunbar, but...

22:43.821 --> 22:45.858
I have every VHS, I have every DVD.

22:45.906 --> 22:48.068
You're so rad in "Warriors",

22:48.117 --> 22:49.858
I just don't want you not
to sign my stuff.

22:49.910 --> 22:51.750
You came to the place,
but I'm officially done.

22:51.787 --> 22:53.870
But wait till you see the
special items I have.

22:53.914 --> 22:55.997
This is "Space Vampires".

22:57.710 --> 23:00.498
How about I sign your face
with my fucking fists?

23:00.546 --> 23:02.899
That's a collector's item you're not
gonna want to take home.

23:02.923 --> 23:04.880
Trust me.

23:05.551 --> 23:07.087
Yes, sir.

23:14.935 --> 23:16.551
[Moose] Can I ask you a question?

23:16.604 --> 23:17.890
[Leah] Mm-hmm.

23:17.938 --> 23:21.056
How do you guys find celebrity houses?

23:21.108 --> 23:23.316
How do you find them?

23:23.360 --> 23:25.067
Why do you ask?

23:26.572 --> 23:27.983
Well, is it difficult?

23:28.032 --> 23:30.570
Is it difficult to find
famous people's houses?

23:30.618 --> 23:34.532
Well, uh... Well, I mean,
sometimes it can be tricky,

23:34.580 --> 23:37.573
but we have our ways.

23:37.666 --> 23:39.999
Do you think that...
that it would be difficult

23:40.085 --> 23:41.496
to find Hunter Dunbar's house?

23:41.545 --> 23:43.912
[Snickers] I can't think of
one good reason

23:43.964 --> 23:46.957
why you, of all people should know
where Hunter Dunbar lives.

23:47.009 --> 23:50.047
I just... I wanna see how
successful he is.

23:51.805 --> 23:53.717
OK. Cool.

23:53.766 --> 23:57.350
Um... well, if I want to get a
really embarrassing shot

23:57.394 --> 24:00.558
of some hung-over
celebutard in his bathrobe

24:00.648 --> 24:02.139
at some other celebutard's house,

24:02.191 --> 24:04.854
I use my handy dandy Star Map app.

24:04.902 --> 24:06.894
- Star Map app?
- Yeah.

24:07.613 --> 24:09.445
It is...

24:09.907 --> 24:11.318
right there.

24:11.408 --> 24:13.149
Holy cow, Batman.

24:13.202 --> 24:15.444
- Pretty cool, right?
- Is this for real?

24:15.496 --> 24:18.910
Yeah. Well, sometimes, I mean,
if the address is wrong

24:18.999 --> 24:20.581
you'll still see a celebrity,

24:20.626 --> 24:22.458
because, I mean, they all live up there.

24:22.503 --> 24:25.291
So either way, cha-ching for me, you know?

24:25.965 --> 24:27.456
Ah. [Gasps]

24:28.133 --> 24:31.592
OK. I'm downloading.

24:31.637 --> 24:33.720
Wait, Moose. You...

24:33.806 --> 24:35.889
You have to promise me, OK?

24:35.933 --> 24:37.344
You have to be careful.

24:37.393 --> 24:40.010
I don't want you to be
accused of stalking.

24:40.062 --> 24:43.055
[Scoffs] That's hilarious.

24:43.107 --> 24:47.477
- I'm not an idiot.
- No. I know you're not.

24:47.528 --> 24:49.690
Alright. You can have one.

24:49.738 --> 24:51.024
- One?
- Yup.

24:51.073 --> 24:53.156
Thanks.

24:54.994 --> 24:56.235
I love you, Moosey.

24:58.247 --> 25:00.739
I love you.

25:02.584 --> 25:05.702
Leah, pick up, pick up, pick up. Pick up!

25:06.964 --> 25:09.331
[Cellphone vibrating]

25:13.178 --> 25:15.591
- Hello?
- 'Leah! I gotta thank you.'

25:15.639 --> 25:17.756
Thank you, thank you, so much.

25:17.808 --> 25:19.891
'OK, calm down. Thank me for what?'

25:19.977 --> 25:22.310
The Star Map app. It's awesome!

25:22.354 --> 25:24.471
It's so awesome. Ben Affleck's house.

25:24.523 --> 25:27.231
'I saw his house. It's so big.

25:27.276 --> 25:29.268
'Did you know he has two pools?'

25:29.319 --> 25:32.858
And James Franco lives 15
minutes away from me.

25:32.990 --> 25:35.528
Fifteen minutes.
He's practically my neighbor.

25:35.576 --> 25:39.911
And Jamie Lee Curtis, her bar is so big.
It's so big, Leah.

25:39.955 --> 25:41.662
OK, Moose.

25:41.707 --> 25:43.699
Just remember what I said, OK?

25:43.751 --> 25:46.209
Don't worry. Don't worry.
Please don't worry.

25:46.253 --> 25:49.337
OK, Moosey out. I gotta go. I gotta go.

25:58.057 --> 26:00.219
'Dear Mr. Dunbar,

26:00.267 --> 26:04.261
'I am writing you because I
really care about you.

26:04.313 --> 26:08.227
'I met you at the Hollywood
Book and Poster Shop.

26:08.275 --> 26:11.985
'You made it clear that I bothered you,

26:12.029 --> 26:15.113
'and that's the last thing
I wanted to do.'

26:17.242 --> 26:18.403
[Sighs]

26:22.664 --> 26:25.077
'I have seen all your movies.

26:25.125 --> 26:27.208
'I love, love, love them.

26:27.252 --> 26:32.464
'But I waited in line for over
an hour to meet you,

26:32.508 --> 26:35.251
'and you didn't even take the time

26:35.302 --> 26:38.136
'to give me one autograph.

26:38.222 --> 26:42.011
'I even spent all my money
to buy your vest.'

26:42.059 --> 26:46.224
Oh, yeah. I'll draw a picture of...
the vest.

26:46.271 --> 26:49.764
'Please take more time to show your fans

26:49.817 --> 26:51.604
'how much you care about them.

26:51.652 --> 26:54.565
'Without us, you're nothing.'

26:54.613 --> 26:56.605
This is gonna do it.

26:56.657 --> 26:59.821
'P.S. Will you please sign my vest

26:59.868 --> 27:03.157
'and follow me on social media?'

'Love...

'Moose.'

2845.

27:18.887 --> 27:20.344
28... Alright.

27:20.430 --> 27:22.422
284...

27:36.029 --> 27:37.770
[Shutter clicks]

27:42.161 --> 27:44.699
[Breathing heavily]

27:51.795 --> 27:53.081
Hey!

27:57.718 --> 27:58.959
Hey.

28:00.012 --> 28:02.095
Can I help you?

28:07.186 --> 28:09.894
Hey, Danny. Why don't you go inside
the house for a second

28:09.938 --> 28:11.520
and fire up the Xbox, alright?

28:11.607 --> 28:13.724
I'll be in in a minute.

28:16.737 --> 28:19.480
Hi, Danny. Hi, Danny.

28:35.672 --> 28:37.664
I don't know what you're
doing outside my house

28:37.716 --> 28:41.300
like some deaf, mute pervert,
but I suggest you keep moving.

28:41.345 --> 28:44.383
Unless you want trouble.

28:44.431 --> 28:48.141
- You want trouble?
- I sure don't. I sure don't.

28:48.185 --> 28:50.302
Here's a letter for you.

28:50.354 --> 28:52.937
- It's a letter.
- You wrote a letter?

28:52.981 --> 28:54.643
I don't accept letters here.

28:57.694 --> 29:01.358
Listen, pal, I don't know
how you found me,

29:01.406 --> 29:04.023
but I don't ever want to see you
in this neighborhood again.

29:04.076 --> 29:05.442
OK? You understand?

29:05.494 --> 29:07.281
I just want your autograph, Mr. Dunbar.

29:07.329 --> 29:10.072
I collect autographs. And I bought your...

29:10.123 --> 29:12.365
I bought your vest from "Vampire Killers".

29:12.459 --> 29:16.419
It was $300. See?

29:16.505 --> 29:18.337
What, are you some sorta
freak autograph hound

29:18.382 --> 29:20.749
that won't leave me the fuck alone?

29:20.801 --> 29:22.884
You can't just come to my
private residence

29:22.928 --> 29:25.045
looking for me.

29:25.097 --> 29:26.838
[Sighs]

29:28.225 --> 29:30.968
[Chuckles] You want my autograph?

29:31.019 --> 29:32.430
Give me the pen.

29:34.231 --> 29:35.472
Thank you.

29:36.358 --> 29:38.350
I got your autograph.

29:38.402 --> 29:40.985
- Right there...
- [Groans]

29:41.029 --> 29:45.023
- ...is my autograph.
- [Writing on shirt]

29:46.493 --> 29:48.985
Now get the fuck out of here.

30:12.102 --> 30:16.312
[Leah] 'They say you should
never meet your heroes.

30:16.356 --> 30:19.269
'But meeting them's not the problem.

30:20.360 --> 30:21.976
'It's when you get too close.

30:25.198 --> 30:28.362
'Close enough to see what's
behind the mask.

30:32.914 --> 30:35.452
'That's a line they don't
want you to cross.'

30:52.517 --> 30:54.804
[Groaning]

31:01.902 --> 31:03.484
[Clears throat]

31:09.785 --> 31:11.617
[British accent] 'Ello, little boy.

31:11.661 --> 31:14.449
You want to take a photograph with me?

31:14.498 --> 31:17.206
- [Recording] '...my mate Dave.'
- Did you see my mate Dave?

31:17.250 --> 31:18.661
'No worries.'

31:18.710 --> 31:20.497
I'm not really from London, you know?

31:20.545 --> 31:23.379
A lot of people think I'm from London.

31:23.423 --> 31:24.459
But I'm not.

31:24.508 --> 31:26.545
- [Applauding]
- [Todd] Come on!

31:28.178 --> 31:32.468
- You seem to know your stuff.
- I sure do. I sure do.

31:32.516 --> 31:34.257
But not like that Todd guy.

31:34.309 --> 31:37.052
He's not a God. He's full of doo-doo.

31:37.104 --> 31:42.816
He doesn't respect Hollywood.
I... I respect Hollywood. Yeah.

31:42.859 --> 31:45.317
[British accent] Alright, true love?

31:47.239 --> 31:49.697
[Regular voice] You're really good.
You're really good.

31:49.741 --> 31:52.108
You're so good. Let me just...

31:57.874 --> 32:00.958
Don't forget to see the Wax
Museum before you go home.

32:03.839 --> 32:05.671
[Coughing]

32:05.715 --> 32:08.048
[Slim] Ah! 'Sup, fucking gaylord?

32:08.093 --> 32:11.211
Hey, hey, oh, oh.
Don't arrest me, Officer.

32:11.263 --> 32:12.925
It wasn't me. No, I swear.

32:12.973 --> 32:15.118
I swear I didn't even know she was
still in high school.

32:15.142 --> 32:16.508
[Slim] He didn't.

32:16.560 --> 32:18.426
Ah, what you doing here, Moose, huh?

32:18.478 --> 32:20.265
Did you make some serious money?

32:20.313 --> 32:22.851
- No, it was pretty slow.
- Oh, slow, huh?

32:22.899 --> 32:24.481
You call that slow? See?

32:24.526 --> 32:26.483
I... I call that ball.

32:26.528 --> 32:28.485
A little fake blood.
A little movie magic.

32:28.530 --> 32:29.896
You like movies, don't you, Moose?

32:29.948 --> 32:32.486
That's what's up. Come on, dude.
Let's celebrate.

32:32.534 --> 32:34.387
You do the honors, Slim.
You fucking earned it today.

32:34.411 --> 32:36.698
You know, I think he should do the honors.

32:36.746 --> 32:39.534
Would you like to do these honors?

32:39.583 --> 32:42.951
- I think he fuckin' would!
- Yeah, suck it, huh?

32:44.004 --> 32:47.042
[Wails] Oh, man!

32:47.090 --> 32:50.583
Yo, when I'm high, it's like the
money rains from the heavens,

32:50.635 --> 32:52.627
right into my pocket.

32:52.679 --> 32:54.591
Then why do you steal from people?

32:54.639 --> 32:57.677
- Why do you steal from people?
- Whoa, whoa, what'd you say?

32:57.726 --> 32:59.308
Something about stealing?

32:59.352 --> 33:00.684
You didn't say nothing.

33:00.729 --> 33:02.206
And that's the way you're gonna keep it.

33:02.230 --> 33:04.392
Give the guy a break.

33:04.441 --> 33:07.684
He's working his ass off out there,
do righty. Just...

33:07.736 --> 33:10.695
He just does it a little bit
different than we do.

33:10.739 --> 33:13.698
- Everything OK in here?
- Yeah.

33:13.742 --> 33:15.574
We're just talking about
the Dodgers, Dick.

33:15.619 --> 33:18.612
Why can't you leave this guy alone, huh?

33:18.663 --> 33:20.655
Now get out of here, you degenerates.

33:20.707 --> 33:23.666
Bye-bye, Moosey.

33:23.710 --> 33:26.703
Keepin' two eyes on you, Moose.

33:27.506 --> 33:29.873
That's not very nice, Dick.

33:29.925 --> 33:32.087
OK?

33:34.846 --> 33:37.634
Why are you letting those freaks push
you around like that?

33:37.682 --> 33:38.923
They're just playing.

33:38.975 --> 33:40.682
You're a good guy, Moose!

33:40.727 --> 33:42.684
You shouldn't be messing
around with those fools.

33:42.729 --> 33:44.721
They're just playing.

33:44.773 --> 33:47.641
You can't let people keep shitting on you.

33:47.692 --> 33:49.149
One day, you're gonna need to learn

33:49.194 --> 33:51.060
how to stand up for yourself.

33:51.154 --> 33:53.897
You're gonna have to learn
how to fight back.

33:53.949 --> 33:56.441
OK?

33:56.493 --> 33:57.529
I'm late.

33:57.577 --> 33:59.694
I've gotta go.

34:05.877 --> 34:07.743
[Leah] 'I have no idea

34:07.796 --> 34:11.085
'why Moose would go back to
that man's house.

34:12.592 --> 34:15.801
But I suppose when you find
the cookie jar...

34:17.013 --> 34:19.847
it's hard to not go back for more.

34:31.570 --> 34:33.357
[Sighs]

34:51.755 --> 34:53.418
[Groans]

34:58.430 --> 35:00.012
[Gasps]

35:02.976 --> 35:05.684
I did it. I did it.

35:20.952 --> 35:23.365
Why would Hunter Dunbar let this die?

35:23.455 --> 35:25.788
- [Banging on window]
- [Woman] Hey!

35:27.042 --> 35:28.874
Get out!

35:28.918 --> 35:31.205
- [Bangs on window]
- Get out of here!

35:52.734 --> 35:55.647
What are you doing?
You trying to give me a heart attack?

35:55.695 --> 35:57.652
Of course not.

35:57.697 --> 36:00.064
You can't just sneak up on
people like that, Moose.

36:00.116 --> 36:02.779
I almost had a shot of Conrad Hall
walking outta Earth Bar.

36:02.827 --> 36:05.285
Earth Bar sucks, no milkshakes.

36:05.330 --> 36:08.038
Yeah, well, your best friend
Hunter Dunbar's co-star,

36:08.083 --> 36:10.120
Ms. Title, walked out of there earlier

36:10.168 --> 36:13.536
and blessed me with a see-through
blouse, no bra.

36:13.630 --> 36:15.917
It's funny that you mention Dunbar.

36:15.965 --> 36:18.833
Because I was just at his house.

36:18.927 --> 36:21.465
- You're kidding, right?
- Nope.

36:21.513 --> 36:23.755
I used the Star Map app,
the one that you told me about.

36:23.807 --> 36:26.766
Takes you directly to his house. And...

36:26.810 --> 36:29.518
His plants, he should take
better care of his plants.

36:29.562 --> 36:32.521
I did not tell you to use
the Star Map app.

36:32.565 --> 36:34.727
- You sure did.
- No, I did not.

36:34.776 --> 36:36.267
I told you about the app

36:36.361 --> 36:38.422
because you are the biggest movie
fan I know, and I thought

36:38.446 --> 36:40.132
you'd get a kick out of seeing
where the stars live.

36:40.156 --> 36:42.113
You cannot just invade people's privacy.

36:42.158 --> 36:44.275
I'm not in trouble, Leah.

36:44.327 --> 36:47.570
I just dropped a letter off at
his house, that was it.

36:47.622 --> 36:49.204
Moose, this is really bad.

36:49.249 --> 36:51.582
I can't believe you're acting like this.

36:51.668 --> 36:53.330
I thought you'd be happy for me.

36:53.378 --> 36:55.085
Happy for you?

36:55.213 --> 36:57.000
I would have never encouraged you

36:57.048 --> 36:59.085
if I knew you'd turn into
a creepy little stalker.

36:59.134 --> 37:04.095
I am not a stalker.
I am a fan, Leah!

37:04.139 --> 37:06.802
You should know that better than anybody.

37:06.850 --> 37:09.843
You're being so mean.
Like Hunter's wife.

37:10.311 --> 37:12.303
Moose!

37:14.274 --> 37:17.858
She is not my BBF. She is not.

37:21.740 --> 37:23.732
Moose! Oh, come on...

37:23.825 --> 37:26.442
Hey, hey. My man!
We on for tonight's show or what?

37:26.494 --> 37:28.486
We are gonna be making mucho Donald Trump.

37:28.580 --> 37:30.641
- Leave me alone, Todd.
- You're not gonna make paper

37:30.665 --> 37:32.907
in that bullshit bobby
cop outfit, alright?

37:33.001 --> 37:36.290
If you really need money,
I can make you money, alright?

37:36.379 --> 37:38.399
Give you what you need,
easy. I go on in 15. Alright?

37:38.423 --> 37:39.959
I can teach you how to hustle.

37:40.049 --> 37:42.757
And I really... I need the cash,
Moose, in a bad way.

37:42.802 --> 37:45.590
Yeah, to buy drugs? To buy drugs?
To buy drugs?

37:45.638 --> 37:48.972
- What does it matter to you?
- I'm not doing it, Todd!

37:49.017 --> 37:51.634
Just leave me alone.
Just leave me alone.

37:51.686 --> 37:54.554
[Mockingly] Just leave me alone.
Just leave me alone.

37:54.647 --> 37:56.013
Fucking pussy!

37:56.107 --> 37:58.269
You don't have the balls to
get what you want.

37:58.318 --> 38:00.731
Alright? I got an amazing
business opportunity here

38:00.820 --> 38:03.312
staring you right in the face,
you know that?

38:03.406 --> 38:05.068
I'm done playing nice. Alright?

38:05.116 --> 38:08.530
You're gonna help me make
some fucking cash, bitch.

38:10.413 --> 38:16.501
I wish Freddy Krueger would come
and chop off your head.

38:16.544 --> 38:20.959
And it would roll in the street and
a truck would squish it

38:21.007 --> 38:24.045
and the blood would splatter everywhere.

38:24.093 --> 38:27.302
And everyone would watch it!

38:27.347 --> 38:30.010
- [Gasping]
- [Breathing heavily]

38:30.058 --> 38:32.015
[Sobs]

38:35.063 --> 38:37.897
You're not worth it anyway.

38:37.941 --> 38:38.977
Moose!

38:40.819 --> 38:42.936
Will I get in trouble?
Am I in trouble?

38:43.029 --> 38:45.817
Are you kidding me?
I'm proud of you.

38:45.865 --> 38:47.322
- You're proud of me?
- Yes.

38:47.367 --> 38:49.324
- You're proud of me?
- You did good.

38:49.369 --> 38:52.487
People have to just stop
calling me a stalker.

38:52.539 --> 38:53.700
Stalker?

38:53.748 --> 38:55.910
They have to stop calling me a loser.

38:55.959 --> 38:59.248
Because I...

38:59.295 --> 39:01.127
Even my friends are calling me that.

39:01.172 --> 39:04.756
Newsflash, Moose:
Todd is not your friend, man.

39:04.801 --> 39:09.717
I know, but people have to
stop picking on me.

39:09.764 --> 39:14.418
I'm gonna make them stop.

39:23.194 --> 39:24.526
[Housekeeper] Mr. Dunbar.

39:24.571 --> 39:27.029
I need to talk to you about something.

39:27.073 --> 39:28.860
This afternoon, while you were out,

39:28.908 --> 39:31.776
some crazy man ran into your backyard.

39:31.828 --> 39:33.694
What are you talking about?

39:33.746 --> 39:35.658
I had to scare him away.

39:36.249 --> 39:37.990
Yeah, well...

39:38.042 --> 39:40.500
you sure this crazy man
wasn't the gardener?

39:40.545 --> 39:42.878
No, this was something different.

39:42.922 --> 39:46.006
Well, whatever you did, it worked.

39:46.050 --> 39:48.087
[Blender whirring]

39:51.556 --> 39:55.550
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Come here.

39:55.602 --> 39:59.892
- You alright?
- I was so scared. [Sniffs]

40:00.690 --> 40:03.057
Jesus, you're shaking.

40:03.735 --> 40:05.772
You OK?

40:05.820 --> 40:07.652
[Breathes deeply]

40:11.576 --> 40:13.283
Yeah.

40:18.875 --> 40:21.333
I'm sorry. I shouldn't

40:23.129 --> 40:25.587
I'm sorry, that was...
That's my fault.

40:25.632 --> 40:28.215
- I apologize.
- It's OK.

40:28.259 --> 40:33.050
It's just... I don't think we
can do that anymore.

40:33.097 --> 40:35.214
OK. OK.

40:40.396 --> 40:41.603
Dora?

40:41.648 --> 40:44.516
Yeah?

40:44.567 --> 40:47.355
You, uh, you're really doing
a great job around here.

40:48.738 --> 40:50.980
Feels like a home again. Thank you.

40:51.032 --> 40:53.069
Mm-hmm.

40:55.203 --> 40:57.160
[Whispers] Shit!

40:57.246 --> 41:00.034
- [♪ Music through headphones]
- Julio.

41:00.083 --> 41:03.042
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Ah.

41:03.086 --> 41:04.952
You gotta listen to me when I talk to you.

41:05.004 --> 41:07.917
Sorry, señor. I was just
listening to my music.

41:08.007 --> 41:11.000
Dora said she saw somebody
sneak into the yard today.

41:11.052 --> 41:14.136
She's concerned, which, you know,
makes me very concerned.

41:14.180 --> 41:17.014
Did you see someone strange
in the yard today?

41:17.058 --> 41:20.096
No, no, señor.
I just focus on work, is all.

41:20.144 --> 41:21.184
- Alright.
- Just work, eh?

41:21.229 --> 41:23.437
OK. Look, do me a favor.

41:23.481 --> 41:26.189
You see somebody strange in the
yard you let me know, OK?

41:26.234 --> 41:27.395
- Sí, sí, sí, sí.
- Alright?

41:27.443 --> 41:30.186
Señor Hunter, it's raining out,
I cannot finish.

41:30.238 --> 41:32.230
Uh, maybe I go home?

41:32.281 --> 41:36.025
- Yeah. Yeah, go home.
- Gracias.

41:40.832 --> 41:44.291
[Hunter] Alright. Come on, we're late.

41:44.335 --> 41:46.292
You gonna score me some
goals today, or what?

41:46.337 --> 41:48.420
- [Danny] Yeah.
- Alright. Get in. Get in...

41:48.464 --> 41:50.672
[Car doors close]

[Leaves rustle]

41:59.475 --> 42:02.434
[Thumping in distance]

42:22.040 --> 42:24.032
- No, don't read it!
- [Dora screams]

42:24.125 --> 42:27.209
Don't read it! Don't read it!
Don't read it!

42:27.795 --> 42:29.377
Ow!

42:30.715 --> 42:33.458
[Screams] Help! Help! Help!

42:33.509 --> 42:35.466
I'm just a fan. I'm just...

42:35.595 --> 42:37.257
- Ayuda, ayuda!
- Just stop hitting me!

42:37.305 --> 42:39.388
- Ayuda!
- Be quiet!

42:42.018 --> 42:45.477
Oh, my gosh. Oh, my gosh.

42:45.521 --> 42:48.059
Are you OK?

42:48.107 --> 42:52.101
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

42:52.153 --> 42:54.065
That's a nosebleed.

42:54.155 --> 42:56.147
That... That's bad. That's bad.

42:56.199 --> 42:59.658
I had a nosebleed. It wasn't fun.

42:59.702 --> 43:02.115
But you... you fix it.

43:02.163 --> 43:05.122
You take paper towels and
you put it up your nose...

Listen to me.

01:03:38.732 --> 01:03:40.519
I fooled Hunter Dunbar.

01:03:40.567 --> 01:03:43.935
I fooled Hunter Dunbar!
I'm such a good actor.

01:03:43.987 --> 01:03:46.320
- You outta your mind?
- You were good, too, though.

01:03:46.364 --> 01:03:48.026
You were really good.
You were good.

01:03:48.074 --> 01:03:50.157
You were better than Jamie Lee Curtis.

01:03:51.703 --> 01:03:53.740
OK. [Sighs]

01:03:53.788 --> 01:03:55.324
Did I cut you?

01:03:59.377 --> 01:04:01.164
Holy crap.

Oh, this isn't good.

01:04:11.264 --> 01:04:13.381
Oh, this is not good.

01:04:13.433 --> 01:04:16.016
You're out of line. Let me go.

01:04:16.061 --> 01:04:17.347
What do you want?

01:04:17.395 --> 01:04:20.354
Why are you so angry all the time?

01:04:20.398 --> 01:04:22.731
I should be the one angry at you.

01:04:22.776 --> 01:04:24.563
Why do you care so much about me?

01:04:24.611 --> 01:04:27.228
Because I love you. And I love you.
And I love you.

01:04:27.322 --> 01:04:29.439
And I... and I've seen all your movies.

01:04:29.491 --> 01:04:32.279
And I love your movies. And I...
think you're the best.

01:04:32.327 --> 01:04:35.786
Untie these ropes, you son of a bitch.
Untie them!

01:04:35.830 --> 01:04:39.369
Stop being so mean to me! Stop it!

01:04:39.459 --> 01:04:42.577
What? You looking for your
15 minutes of fame? Huh?

01:04:42.629 --> 01:04:44.586
You wanna end up on the nightly news?

01:04:44.631 --> 01:04:47.374
They're gonna call you a monster.

01:04:51.346 --> 01:04:53.008
What's in the bag?

01:04:55.016 --> 01:04:59.181
Hunter, be patient, please.
It's a surprise.

01:05:00.397 --> 01:05:02.104
OK, ready?

01:05:03.024 --> 01:05:04.390
Mr. Blonde.

01:05:04.442 --> 01:05:06.775
- Holy shit! No.

There's no gas in here, it's just water.

I'm sorry I was mean to you.

01:05:26.965 --> 01:05:29.026
You're the meanest person
I've ever known in my life.

01:05:29.050 --> 01:05:31.337
Let me make it up to you.

01:05:31.386 --> 01:05:32.922
I'll sign whatever you want.

01:05:32.971 --> 01:05:35.884

from "The Hungry Ones".

I could get it.
I can sign it right now.

01:05:37.684 --> 01:05:39.676
What kind of moron do you think I am?

01:05:39.727 --> 01:05:42.060
I don't think anybody's a moron.

01:05:42.105 --> 01:05:43.596
- Yes, you do.
- No, I don't.

01:05:43.648 --> 01:05:46.732
And I know what you think of me.
You think I'm a stalker!

- No.
- Yes, you do.

01:05:48.903 --> 01:05:51.816
But I go to every one of your movies.

01:05:51.865 --> 01:05:54.107
Even the crappy ones.

01:05:54.159 --> 01:05:57.903
You've gotta understand something.

01:05:57.954 --> 01:06:00.321
You hold the power in this relationship.

01:06:00.373 --> 01:06:01.659

Say that again.

01:06:10.425 --> 01:06:13.168
- What?
- What you said, say it.

01:06:17.557 --> 01:06:20.095
You are a fan.

you don't know anything

Just let me go, man.

I'm an actor, alright?

01:12:05.988 --> 01:12:08.230
Well, actors they try this technique

called visualization.

What is that? What is that?

01:12:12.995 --> 01:12:14.827
It means to imagine.

01:12:20.419 --> 01:12:22.832

01:12:24.799 --> 01:12:27.007
Alright, here. Come here.

01:12:27.051 --> 01:12:30.135
Kneel down, get comfortable.

comfortable. Just relax.

- I do.
- Alright.

01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:00.241
First thing we're gonna do, is

01:13:00.293 --> 01:13:02.751
we're gonna change these dirty clothes.

01:13:02.795 --> 01:13:05.879
We're gonna take off this sweat,
this blood and this gasoline,

01:13:05.923 --> 01:13:08.165
and we're gonna put on
some fresh new duds.

01:13:08.217 --> 01:13:11.756
We're gonna look spiffy, Moose.
We're gonna look good.

01:13:11.804 --> 01:13:13.323
And then we're gonna go out on the town.

01:13:13.347 --> 01:13:16.135
We're gonna go to one of those
Hollywood fancy joints.

01:13:16.183 --> 01:13:18.891
Musso & Frank's?
We're going to Musso & Frank's?

01:13:18.936 --> 01:13:20.472
Wherever you want, man.

01:13:20.521 --> 01:13:22.416
We'll go wherever you want.
I'll call my manager,

01:13:22.440 --> 01:13:24.397
he'll get us a table wherever
you wanna go.

01:13:24.442 --> 01:13:26.149
And when it's all done,

01:13:26.193 --> 01:13:28.105
we'll get a big bowl of
chocolate ice cream.

01:13:28.154 --> 01:13:29.816
Strawberry. Strawberry ice cream.

01:13:29.864 --> 01:13:32.197

Strawberry ice cream, Moose,
of course. Of course.

01:13:35.161 --> 01:13:38.074
And then... and then we'll
go back to my place

01:13:38.122 --> 01:13:40.705
and throw on a couple of my action films,

01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:42.833
and watch them on the HD TV.

01:13:42.877 --> 01:13:45.085
- [Moose chuckles]
- Does that sound good, man?

01:13:45.129 --> 01:13:49.123
- I love you. I love you.
- Ah, you, me,

01:13:49.175 --> 01:13:50.916
couple of action flicks,

01:13:50.968 --> 01:13:54.382
