- All right, honey,

00:28.834 --> 00:31.233
I want you to tell me the second
you pass Clarkson's farm.

00:31.367 --> 00:32.233
The second?

00:32.367 --> 00:33.367
Yes!

00:33.500 --> 00:35.533
My cookies take 7 minutes
and 20 seconds to bake.

00:35.667 --> 00:38.500
Five... four... three...

00:38.633 --> 00:40.200
two... one.

00:41.467 --> 00:43.900
Congratulations--
there is a warm snowman

00:44.033 --> 00:44.834
in your future.

00:44.967 --> 00:45.900
Well, what if
I get a flat tire?

You made it!

01:02.066 --> 01:03.266
Look at you.

01:03.400 --> 01:04.467
It's not Christmas

01:04.600 --> 01:06.300
until you've got
Nana's apron on, hey?

01:06.433 --> 01:07.633
Oh, and...

01:07.767 --> 01:09.266
Mm--

01:09.400 --> 01:11.567
Mm! Heaven, as always.

01:11.700 --> 01:14.300
Oh! I'm so excited
that you're here!

01:14.433 --> 01:16.567
I can't believe
you finally took a vacation.

01:16.700 --> 01:17.567
Well, there's a lot to do,

01:17.700 --> 01:18.700
and I couldn't let you
go it alone.

01:18.834 --> 01:20.233
Sorting, hauling...

01:20.367 --> 01:22.567
And-- and... Christmas.

01:22.700 --> 01:23.567
Of course.

01:23.700 --> 01:26.300
And seeing that sign
in front of our house

01:26.433 --> 01:28.767
is so weird.

01:28.900 --> 01:29.967
I know.

01:30.100 --> 01:32.967
But I think
you'll like the condo.

01:34.033 --> 01:35.567
Come on, let's get your stuff.

01:40.500 --> 01:44.633
Aw, Mom.
It looks so beautiful in here!

01:44.767 --> 01:47.233
Look at that tree--
gorgeous.

01:47.367 --> 01:49.300
Clarkson's Farm, of course.

01:49.433 --> 01:51.367
And the reindeer that Dad made outside...

01:51.500 --> 01:52.567
the stockings...

01:52.700 --> 01:54.867
Oh, no!
I just realized...

01:55.900 --> 01:58.400
I don't have a fireplace
at the condo.

01:58.533 --> 01:59.600
That is okay.

01:59.734 --> 02:01.767
We will find somewhere else
to hang them.

02:01.900 --> 02:03.967
But, speaking of moving--

02:04.100 --> 02:06.700
I was expecting to see
lots of packing boxes.

02:06.834 --> 02:08.967
There's no reason
to rush the inevitable.

02:09.100 --> 02:11.033
Mom, after Christmas,
we're gonna have, like,

02:11.166 --> 02:12.700
five days to pack up
your whole house!

02:12.834 --> 02:14.867
I know, but this is
our last Christmas here.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.734
Can't we enjoy it
for a little while?

02:17.667 --> 02:18.700
A little.

02:18.834 --> 02:20.467
Nana's piano.

02:20.600 --> 02:23.800
Oh, such a richer sound
than my upright in New York.

02:23.934 --> 02:25.800
I always loved this thing.

02:25.934 --> 02:26.800
Me too.

02:26.934 --> 02:28.166
All right, young lady,

02:28.300 --> 02:30.000
let's get you upstairs
and freshened up.

02:30.133 --> 02:31.734
We've got a big day ahead.

02:32.667 --> 02:33.734
Can't wait.

02:43.166 --> 02:46.800
Do you think Dad's old posters
will fit in the new place?

02:46.934 --> 02:48.667
Well, we'll have to measure.

02:48.800 --> 02:51.433
When do I get to see
your new condo, by the way?

02:51.567 --> 02:54.133
Well, uh...
we can go tomorrow morning.

02:54.266 --> 02:55.934
- I get the key tonight.
- I can't wait.

03:16.633 --> 03:18.433
Send me the Atlantic Ridge
Energies ledger

03:18.567 --> 03:20.367
as soon as you got it, okay?

03:20.500 --> 03:21.567
Thanks.

03:21.700 --> 03:23.700
That doesn't sound
very vacation-y.

03:23.834 --> 03:24.934
Ugh, sorry.

03:25.066 --> 03:26.834
I'm drafting an appeal
that I need to file in January.

03:26.967 --> 03:28.166
Over Christmas?

03:28.300 --> 03:30.367
Don't worry--
you are not even gonna notice.

03:30.500 --> 03:32.000
You ready to go?

03:32.133 --> 03:33.200
Yes.

03:33.333 --> 03:35.033
But I believe...

03:35.166 --> 03:37.433
we need these!

03:37.567 --> 03:38.867
Aw! The Santa mugs!

03:39.000 --> 03:40.233
Mm-hmm.

03:40.367 --> 03:42.433
Where did Dad
find these, again?

03:42.567 --> 03:44.200
Chattanooga.

03:44.333 --> 03:45.367
You were almost four--

03:45.500 --> 03:47.367
it was the year
before he passed.

03:47.500 --> 03:49.367
He played an extra gig
that night,

03:49.500 --> 03:51.066
which barely paid
for the gasoline,

03:51.200 --> 03:52.533
but I fell in love
with these cups

03:52.667 --> 03:54.100
the minute I saw them.

03:54.233 --> 03:55.133
Look.

03:55.266 --> 03:57.033
It's a shame we can't
take this doorframe

03:57.166 --> 03:58.533
with us across town.

03:58.667 --> 04:00.934
So many memories here.

04:01.066 --> 04:02.133
It's gonna be hard
to say goodbye.

04:02.266 --> 04:03.433
It will.

04:03.567 --> 04:05.133
Oh! Look at the time.

04:05.266 --> 04:07.734
Oh, better go.

04:21.734 --> 04:23.967
Sara Thompson!
You're back home!

04:24.100 --> 04:25.166
Mr. T!

04:25.300 --> 04:26.467
Hi!

04:26.600 --> 04:28.300
And what have you got
in that handsome cup?

04:28.433 --> 04:30.667
Oh, well, it was cocoa
from the bookstore.

04:30.800 --> 04:32.633
Mm. Well, no need
to try the rest,

04:32.767 --> 04:34.567
because now
you got the best--

04:34.700 --> 04:36.333
...from Hickory Real Estate!

04:36.467 --> 04:38.633
Serving the same at the office,
just a half a block west!

04:38.767 --> 04:41.667
Ted Ramsey,
are you always selling?

04:41.800 --> 04:42.767
Oh, why are you asking?

04:42.900 --> 04:43.967
Can I interest you
in another condo?

04:44.934 --> 04:46.233
Ladies and gentlemen!

04:46.367 --> 04:47.633
Can I have your attention, please?

04:49.433 --> 04:52.734
It's almost time...
to light our tree!

04:54.200 --> 04:55.100
For all of you out there

04:55.233 --> 04:57.767
new to our
"Lights Carols" festival,

04:57.900 --> 04:58.934
we've got a real treat
for you!

04:59.066 --> 05:02.367
Two weeks chock-full
of so many fun events,

05:02.500 --> 05:06.300
and on our last night--
the big Christmas concert!

05:08.033 --> 05:11.333
Now, I am pleased to announce

05:11.467 --> 05:14.200
our brand-new concert producer

05:14.333 --> 05:15.567
is our very own

05:15.700 --> 05:17.900
Josh Hartman!

05:20.834 --> 05:22.467
Thanks.

05:22.600 --> 05:24.166
I'll be brief...

05:24.300 --> 05:25.900
because Christmas is coming

05:26.033 --> 05:27.467
and I've got
a lot of work to do!

05:28.867 --> 05:30.500
This is, uh, quite an honor.

05:30.633 --> 05:31.834
Unexpected, but great.

05:31.967 --> 05:35.033
Auditions will be happening in
two days at the civic theater,

05:35.166 --> 05:36.834
and I am really looking forward

05:36.967 --> 05:38.834
to hearing
the voices of my hometown!

05:42.133 --> 05:44.066
Well, we are thrilled

05:44.200 --> 05:46.000
to have a big Nashville
performer take over,

05:46.133 --> 05:47.333
and, oh, by the way, Josh?

05:47.467 --> 05:48.967
No pressure.

05:49.100 --> 05:50.500
And now,

05:50.633 --> 05:51.567
it is my honor

05:51.700 --> 05:53.900
to commence
our Christmas season!

05:54.033 --> 05:55.367
Are you ready?

05:57.166 --> 05:58.667
Are you ready?

05:58.800 --> 06:00.400
Yeah!

06:00.533 --> 06:01.800
Josh, would you like
do the honors?

06:01.934 --> 06:03.100
I would love to.

06:03.233 --> 06:05.066
I proclaim

06:05.200 --> 06:08.066
the Oakcrest Carols Lights Festival

06:08.200 --> 06:10.100
has begun in three...

06:10.233 --> 06:12.600
...Two, one...

06:12.734 --> 06:15.367
Merry Christmas!

06:16.834 --> 06:18.133
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

06:18.266 --> 06:19.934
Merry Christmas, Mom.

06:20.066 --> 06:21.400
Anna!

06:21.533 --> 06:23.066
Ahh! Merry Christmas!

06:23.200 --> 06:24.266
Right back at ya!

06:24.400 --> 06:25.800
Sara, hi!

06:26.934 --> 06:28.867
Isn't that something
about Josh?

06:29.000 --> 06:30.800
I bet you're jumping for joy.

06:30.934 --> 06:32.633
It... sure is something.

06:32.767 --> 06:34.433
It was kind of a surprise.

06:34.567 --> 06:35.934
Oh!

06:40.266 --> 06:41.533
Josh?

06:42.700 --> 06:43.667
Hi.

06:44.600 --> 06:46.333
Hi.

06:48.100 --> 06:51.133
Uh... wow, I-I haven't seen you
once in ten years

06:51.266 --> 06:52.066
during the holidays, and...

06:52.200 --> 06:55.233
and here you are,
home already.

06:55.367 --> 06:56.967
Hey, congratulations.

06:57.100 --> 06:58.800
You'll be a natural
at producing the concert.

06:58.934 --> 07:01.800
Oh, yeah.
Well, we'll see about that.

07:03.967 --> 07:05.300
Josh?

07:05.433 --> 07:07.600
We'd better get back.

07:09.266 --> 07:11.100
Ahem.

07:12.133 --> 07:14.300
I'll see you around.

07:14.433 --> 07:15.533
Yeah.

07:15.667 --> 07:17.433
See ya.

07:25.266 --> 07:28.300
Ugh, another year,
another hot-cocoa stomachache.

07:30.100 --> 07:32.667
So, did you know
that Josh was back in town?

07:32.800 --> 07:34.133
No.

07:34.266 --> 07:36.133
I mean, his uncle
did mention once

07:36.266 --> 07:38.000
that he thought
that Josh would be perfect

07:38.133 --> 07:39.667
to take over
producing the concert,

07:39.800 --> 07:42.633
but I thought Josh was dug in
in Nashville.

07:42.767 --> 07:44.934
What was it like--
seeing him again?

07:45.066 --> 07:47.066
Fine.
Why wouldn't it be fine?

07:48.600 --> 07:51.133
Well, was he excited
about the concert?

07:51.266 --> 07:53.633
Uh, yeah, he seemed
kind of nervous.

07:53.767 --> 07:55.166
Well, two weeks
to produce a concert,

07:55.300 --> 07:58.133
when you've never done it--
I'd be nervous, too.

07:58.266 --> 07:59.200
- Mm.
- I'm gonna turn in early.

07:59.333 --> 08:01.033
We're gonna go see
the condo in the morning.

08:01.166 --> 08:03.100
Oh, no. The condo.

08:03.233 --> 08:04.333
What?

08:04.467 --> 08:06.433
Ted Ramsey was supposed
to give me the keys tonight.

08:06.567 --> 08:07.700
Well,
with the Cocoa Crawl tonight,

08:07.834 --> 08:09.400
his office
is probably still open,

08:09.533 --> 08:10.700
so I'll just walk there
and pick 'em up.

08:10.834 --> 08:11.934
Oh, I can drive you.

08:12.066 --> 08:13.700
I live in Manhattan--
we walk.

08:13.834 --> 08:16.800
Mm. That's right. Manhattan.

08:27.367 --> 08:28.533
Hello?

08:28.667 --> 08:30.500
Anybody here?

08:30.633 --> 08:34.367
Hey, sorry,
there's no cocoa left.

08:34.500 --> 08:36.033
Oh. Hi. Again.

08:36.166 --> 08:39.367
No hot chocolate,
but thanks.

08:39.500 --> 08:41.433
So you're helping
your uncle out?

08:41.567 --> 08:43.767
I am, yeah.

08:43.900 --> 08:48.400
Combination office floater
and, uh, cocoa barista.

08:48.533 --> 08:50.533
Do you need something?

08:50.667 --> 08:53.867
Ted was supposed to give my mom
the keys to her new condo,

08:54.000 --> 08:55.433
but didn't happen.

08:55.567 --> 08:57.700
I think the locksmith dropped
those keys off yesterday.

08:57.834 --> 08:58.700
Let me take a look.

08:58.834 --> 09:00.400
Okay.

09:00.533 --> 09:02.800
So... you are working here

09:02.934 --> 09:04.633
and producing
the Christmas concert?

09:04.767 --> 09:06.433
Yeah, that's the idea.

09:06.567 --> 09:08.100
What happened to Nashville?

09:08.233 --> 09:09.467
Nothin'.
It's still there.

09:09.600 --> 09:11.300
Grand Ole Opry,
Bluebird Cafe.

09:11.433 --> 09:12.266
Yeah. I mean--

09:12.400 --> 09:13.700
Yeah, I know what you mean.

09:15.266 --> 09:17.900
I was just doing my thing
in Music City.

09:18.033 --> 09:19.567
Uncle Ted called
and said they were in a panic

09:19.700 --> 09:20.767
to find a new producer,

09:20.900 --> 09:22.800
and he convinced me
I was the right guy for the job,

09:22.934 --> 09:23.734
so here I am.

09:23.867 --> 09:25.433
That's great.

09:27.934 --> 09:29.767
Josh? Are you ready to go?

09:29.900 --> 09:32.100
Can you just give me a second?

09:32.233 --> 09:33.734
Yeah, I'll be parked
right outside.

09:36.233 --> 09:37.567
You're making new friends.

09:38.633 --> 09:41.033
Well, it's a friendly place.

09:42.600 --> 09:44.834
Congratulations to your mom.

09:44.967 --> 09:47.734
My uncle says that the condo's
a perfect place for her.

09:48.900 --> 09:49.867
Anything else?

09:50.800 --> 09:52.033
Look, Josh,
I'm glad to see you're back.

09:53.033 --> 09:56.266
Now you have music and family.

09:56.400 --> 09:58.166
It's everything
you said you ever wanted,

09:58.300 --> 09:59.700
back when...

10:01.734 --> 10:04.934
When we were, um...
ahem, making plans?

10:06.033 --> 10:07.333
Yeah.

10:07.467 --> 10:09.867
Yeah... what a waste that was.

10:10.900 --> 10:13.300
Uh... look, I'm sorry.

10:13.433 --> 10:15.934
I've got
concert meetings in the morning,

10:16.066 --> 10:18.066
auditions in two days, so...

10:18.200 --> 10:20.200
Josh--

10:23.767 --> 10:25.266
Forget it.

10:25.400 --> 10:27.100
I can see
you have your hands full.

10:27.233 --> 10:28.600
Yeah.

10:28.734 --> 10:30.667
I am busy, so.

10:30.800 --> 10:32.033
Merry Christmas.

10:46.300 --> 10:48.500
This is so cute!

10:48.633 --> 10:52.166
Oh, really?
I'm glad you like it.

10:52.300 --> 10:54.133
Huh. This is it.

10:54.266 --> 10:55.967
- That's my unit.
- Hi.

10:56.100 --> 10:57.433
Hi.

10:57.567 --> 10:58.934
Is this your condo?

10:59.066 --> 11:01.033
- Yes, it is.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

11:01.166 --> 11:02.667
My daughter told me
this unit was empty.

11:02.800 --> 11:05.533
I'm trying to unload
this tree here.

11:05.667 --> 11:06.834
Um...

11:06.967 --> 11:09.567
I'm George Brooks.
My daughter lives next door.

11:09.700 --> 11:13.166
Oh! Oh, well, hi. I'm Anna.
This is my daughter, Sara.

11:13.300 --> 11:14.367
Oh, nice to meet you guys.

11:14.500 --> 11:16.166
Well, I'll get out of your way.

11:16.300 --> 11:17.166
No, no. Please, please don't

11:17.300 --> 11:19.233
We're just here
to take some measurements.

11:19.367 --> 11:20.567
We can take a visitor's spot.

11:20.700 --> 11:22.500
I don't move in
till after Christmas.

11:22.633 --> 11:23.500
- You sure?
- Yes.

11:23.633 --> 11:25.033
Oh, I really appreciate it.

11:25.166 --> 11:27.667
Well, I'm sure
I'll see you around.

11:27.800 --> 11:29.200
I'm doing a little work
on her kitchen.

11:29.333 --> 11:31.066
If there's anything you need--
anything at all--

11:31.200 --> 11:33.033
just-- just ask.

11:33.166 --> 11:36.000
Oh, well, thanks.
We'll be fine.

11:36.133 --> 11:37.300
But you never know!

11:37.433 --> 11:38.734
You never know.

11:38.867 --> 11:40.333
Yeah.

11:42.133 --> 11:43.233
He's cute!

11:46.633 --> 11:48.567
Oh!

11:48.700 --> 11:50.166
Mom, I love it!

11:50.300 --> 11:52.100
Do you really?

11:53.500 --> 11:54.500
I mean, it is nice.

11:54.633 --> 11:55.800
You know what?

11:55.934 --> 11:58.033
I know you're right
about selling the house.

11:58.166 --> 12:00.133
It's less maintenance,
for sure.

12:00.266 --> 12:01.900
Change can be good.

12:02.033 --> 12:03.400
You're right. It can.

12:06.333 --> 12:08.900
Oh, honey, I've got to go
to the hospital.

12:09.033 --> 12:10.300
I thought
you had the time off?

12:10.433 --> 12:11.600
Well, I do,
but a water pipe broke,

12:11.734 --> 12:12.967
and they're having
to move patients.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.500
I really should be there.

12:15.734 --> 12:18.433
I forgot.
Maybe you can cover for me.

12:18.567 --> 12:19.300
Cover what?

12:19.433 --> 12:20.300
I'm supposed to be a judge

12:20.433 --> 12:21.967
for the gingerbread house
contest in town--

12:22.100 --> 12:23.700
- Uh--
- ...In 30 minutes.

12:23.834 --> 12:25.400
No, no, Mom,
I do not have time to--

12:28.066 --> 12:29.433
Okay.

12:29.567 --> 12:30.567
Thank you.

12:30.700 --> 12:31.400
I love you!

12:31.533 --> 12:32.600
I love you.

12:34.367 --> 12:37.233
It's gingerbread.
How stressful can it be?

12:39.033 --> 12:41.066
Okay, everyone!
The time has come!

12:41.200 --> 12:43.767
One lucky boy or girl
is going to win

12:43.900 --> 12:47.767
the 68th Annual Oakcrest
Gingerbread House Competition.

12:50.233 --> 12:51.934
Now let's meet our judges.

12:52.066 --> 12:55.400
From the Thompson family,
past winner Sara Thompson.

12:58.834 --> 13:00.500
And our other judge--

13:00.633 --> 13:03.266
our brand-new maestro...

13:03.400 --> 13:04.533
Josh Hartman!

13:06.600 --> 13:07.967
Your uncle make you do this?

13:08.100 --> 13:10.333
No, my uncle just asked me
to do this.

13:10.467 --> 13:11.867
I didn't know you'd be here.

13:12.000 --> 13:13.800
Same. Funny coincidence, huh?

13:13.934 --> 13:15.834
Mm. Hilarious.

13:15.967 --> 13:17.934
Okay! Let's get started.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.734
Ooh! Very nice!

13:23.166 --> 13:26.133
Love the angles
on the farmhouse!

13:26.266 --> 13:27.300
It's nice, but--

13:27.433 --> 13:31.300
Whoa! Look at the frosted snow
on Santa's cottage,

13:31.433 --> 13:34.166
oh, and the feel of
a glowing fire inside.

13:34.300 --> 13:36.633
It's not about "feeling".
It's about skill.

13:36.767 --> 13:38.767
- It's about artistry.
- It's about planning.

13:38.900 --> 13:40.100
It's about passion!

13:40.233 --> 13:41.133
What's "passion"?

13:41.266 --> 13:42.333
- Oh, it's when--
- Uh! You know...

13:42.467 --> 13:43.500
why don't we, uh...

13:43.633 --> 13:45.467
huddle?

13:45.600 --> 13:47.033
Okay, uh, do we have a winner?

13:47.166 --> 13:49.166
Yeah, number one.
Best layout, best execution.

13:49.300 --> 13:50.533
No. Number six.

13:50.667 --> 13:53.300
Great imagination.
Really sings to me.

13:54.800 --> 13:56.233
Oh, boy. Um...

13:57.300 --> 13:58.200
Okay!

13:58.333 --> 14:01.233
Uh, the winner is...

14:01.367 --> 14:02.533
number seven!

14:19.467 --> 14:21.033
Sara?

14:21.166 --> 14:22.266
You dropped this.

14:22.400 --> 14:24.066
Thanks.

14:24.200 --> 14:25.533
I'll, uh, see you around.

14:25.667 --> 14:26.567
Yep.

14:26.700 --> 14:28.400
Hey, how do you remember it?

14:28.533 --> 14:29.367
What?

14:29.500 --> 14:30.633
Us.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.333
I gotta get going.

14:38.333 --> 14:40.033
You know what?

14:40.166 --> 14:41.533
Three years we were together,

14:41.667 --> 14:43.400
dreaming about our future,

14:43.533 --> 14:45.367
and right when
we had an actual plan,

14:45.500 --> 14:47.033
I turned around
and you were gone.

14:47.166 --> 14:48.734
Okay, well, that's not
exactly how it happened.

14:48.867 --> 14:50.867
We had a showcase lined up
in Nashville,

14:51.000 --> 14:52.533
- and you ghosted me.
- A showcase is no guarantee!

14:52.667 --> 14:53.867
That's life!
There are no guarantees.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.166
It's complicated,

14:55.300 --> 14:57.533
but I am not the first person
to choose to go to college.

14:57.667 --> 14:59.533
Can you seriously
blame me for that?

14:59.667 --> 15:01.133
No, but I can blame you
for bailing on me

15:01.266 --> 15:02.467
without
so much as a goodbye.

15:02.600 --> 15:04.734
I had to go right away.

15:04.867 --> 15:06.767
Okay, great. You know what?
This is useless.

15:06.900 --> 15:08.000
No.

15:08.133 --> 15:10.166
Just because
I gave up on music

15:10.300 --> 15:12.000
does not mean
that I gave up on you and me.

15:12.133 --> 15:13.300
Okay? I wrote.

15:13.433 --> 15:16.266
I called you dozens
and dozens of times,

15:16.400 --> 15:18.300
and you never got back to me.

15:18.433 --> 15:20.333
You are the one
who quit on us, Josh.

15:21.934 --> 15:23.333
Wow.

15:23.467 --> 15:25.266
Look, Sara.

15:25.400 --> 15:27.433
It's the holidays.

15:27.567 --> 15:29.934
We're probably
going to bump into each other,

15:30.066 --> 15:33.166
so why don't we just
get through this

15:33.300 --> 15:34.600
and go our separate ways?

15:34.734 --> 15:37.333
It should be
really easy for you.

15:50.400 --> 15:51.500
Oh, honey...

15:51.633 --> 15:53.333
you know, Ted must have
had his reasons,

15:53.467 --> 15:55.300
for sending Josh to judge.

15:55.433 --> 15:58.133
You know, he's always
liked the two of you together.

15:58.266 --> 16:00.734
Always said you were
the next "Faith and Tim".

16:00.867 --> 16:03.333
Well, that ship
sailed a long time ago.

16:03.467 --> 16:05.400
Plus, Josh isn't any fun anymore.

16:05.533 --> 16:07.166
Really? What did he say?

16:08.300 --> 16:11.667
He feels like I shouldn't have
strung him along for so long

16:11.800 --> 16:12.667
if I was just gonna
run off to college

16:12.800 --> 16:13.734
in the end anyway.

16:13.867 --> 16:16.834
Well, you had a great
scholarship to Yale.

16:16.967 --> 16:18.667
Who passes up that?

16:18.800 --> 16:20.333
I didn't,

16:20.467 --> 16:23.667
but I was really confused
back then.

16:23.800 --> 16:25.200
I know.

16:25.333 --> 16:28.500
I mean, I definitely could have
handled things better with him.

16:28.633 --> 16:30.033
Well...

16:31.767 --> 16:33.467
Oh, I'll get it.

16:39.367 --> 16:42.000
You, uh, sure
you have the right house?

16:42.133 --> 16:45.667
Very funny.
It's a gift for your mom.

16:45.800 --> 16:47.934
Oh, Josh?
Come on in!

16:51.133 --> 16:52.400
What is this?

16:53.467 --> 16:55.667
Oh, ho...

16:55.800 --> 16:57.066
Swiss chocolate?

16:57.200 --> 17:00.467
Oh, no chance those
will make it till Christmas.

17:00.600 --> 17:02.633
Mm-mm. You didn't have
to get me a Christmas present.

17:02.767 --> 17:04.633
Oh, no, it's a thank-you
from Uncle Ted,

17:04.767 --> 17:06.567
and everyone
at Hickory Realty.

17:06.700 --> 17:07.900
For becoming

17:08.033 --> 17:09.633
such a valued customer
this year.

17:09.767 --> 17:11.867
That's so sweet.

17:13.233 --> 17:15.400
Josh? Something wrong?

17:15.533 --> 17:17.100
My rehearsal pianist
fell through,

17:17.233 --> 17:19.734
got a gig in Memphis,
and now my backup's falling out.

17:19.867 --> 17:21.533
Aren't auditions tomorrow?

17:21.667 --> 17:23.967
Yeah, um, listen,
I should get going.

17:24.100 --> 17:26.233
I need to deal with this.
Enjoy the candy.

17:26.367 --> 17:28.133
- Okay, thank you.
- Merry Christmas.

17:28.266 --> 17:30.233
Merry Christmas.

17:34.533 --> 17:36.600
No good deed
goes unpunished, hey?

17:36.734 --> 17:37.934
Guy comes back
to rescue his hometown--

17:38.066 --> 17:39.500
now look.

17:41.200 --> 17:41.967
There's always you.

17:42.100 --> 17:43.433
Me?

17:43.567 --> 17:45.800
Mm. You play piano beautifully,
ad you can sight-read.

17:45.934 --> 17:49.033
Oh, I do not have time
for Josh's auditions.

17:49.166 --> 17:51.133
Okay? We have Christmas
shopping to do,

17:51.266 --> 17:52.233
and packing.

17:52.367 --> 17:54.600
This is a vacation,
not a military operation.

17:54.734 --> 17:56.100
Yeah, but the move,

17:56.233 --> 17:58.300
and I have this appeal
that I'm working on.

17:58.433 --> 18:00.133
I am so proud
of how driven you are,

18:00.266 --> 18:01.500
but you do love to play.

18:01.633 --> 18:02.800
You go do what you have to do,

18:02.934 --> 18:05.066
and I'll finish the cookies, okay?

18:08.667 --> 18:10.266
Fine.

18:14.400 --> 18:15.633
Josh?

18:15.767 --> 18:17.667
Hey, um,

18:17.800 --> 18:20.500
if I were able to play piano
for your auditions tomorrow,

18:20.633 --> 18:21.800
how long would it take?

18:21.934 --> 18:23.633
Uh, I don't know,
three hours, tops?

18:23.767 --> 18:25.567
Okay. I can do it.

18:26.467 --> 18:27.367
Wait a minute.

18:27.500 --> 18:29.200
When's the last time
you even played a piano?

18:29.333 --> 18:30.300
With my coffee
this morning.

18:30.433 --> 18:31.834
Seriously?

18:31.967 --> 18:33.033
Fair enough.

18:33.166 --> 18:34.800
You go with your other choice.

18:34.934 --> 18:35.633
No, no, no, no, no!

18:35.767 --> 18:38.633
Uh... 9:00 a.m., sharp?

19:00.967 --> 19:05.000
Are you sure you can audition
all these acts in three hours?

19:05.133 --> 19:07.033
Ah, I'll just make it work.

19:07.166 --> 19:10.233
Unlike the law,
showbiz is spontaneous.

19:11.266 --> 19:15.000
Brr-rr-rr-rr.
Um-um-um-um-um-um-um, ahh...

19:15.133 --> 19:16.000
Just give me a second.

Just take a deep breath.

20:25.834 --> 20:29.133
You know the word--
it comes from tree trunks.

20:29.266 --> 20:31.233
Branches!

20:32.333 --> 20:33.200
Friend?

20:33.333 --> 20:35.967
Yeah. The girl.
From the other day.

20:36.100 --> 20:38.166
Brooke?

20:38.300 --> 20:40.500
She's a receptionist
at my Uncle Ted's.

20:40.633 --> 20:42.700
Drummer's her boyfriend.

20:42.834 --> 20:44.200
Oh.

20:44.333 --> 20:47.700
All right, thank you.
We'll, uh, we'll let you know.

20:47.834 --> 20:49.533
All right.
You can call my agent.

20:49.667 --> 20:52.400
I'm totally kidding.
Y-- You can just call my mom.

20:57.133 --> 20:58.133
They were great!

20:58.266 --> 20:59.200
Yeah.

20:59.333 --> 21:01.000
You... have a way with talent.

21:02.033 --> 21:03.734
Oh, and
that little girl, Ellie?

21:03.867 --> 21:06.834
Definitely keep her in the mix--
she's gonna be a crowd favorite.

21:09.700 --> 21:13.066
Hey, what did you think
about that garage band?

21:13.200 --> 21:14.533
You think any of them
were good enough

21:14.667 --> 21:16.367
to round out
our concert's pit-band?

21:16.500 --> 21:19.200
Oof. Uh, what are
your other choices?

21:19.333 --> 21:20.867
Well, I am scouting
some players tonight

21:21.000 --> 21:22.266
at the Santa Jam.

21:22.400 --> 21:24.333
Maybe...

21:24.467 --> 21:25.767
I'll see you there?

21:25.900 --> 21:27.900
I have to start packing up
my whole house,

21:28.033 --> 21:29.600
or this move's
never gonna happen,

21:29.734 --> 21:31.233
but good luck with it.

21:31.367 --> 21:32.433
You too.

21:32.567 --> 21:33.700
Thanks for today.

21:33.834 --> 21:35.200
You bet.

21:50.166 --> 21:52.233
Honey, are you sure
you can't come to Santa Jam?

21:52.367 --> 21:53.367
Too much to do.

21:53.500 --> 21:55.033
But you go have fun
with Imogene.

21:55.166 --> 21:57.934
So, is this what it's like
for you in New York?

21:58.066 --> 21:59.367
14-hour days,

21:59.500 --> 22:01.500
and then home
to last week's casserole?

22:01.633 --> 22:03.467
Absolutely not.

22:03.600 --> 22:04.767
I get take-out there.

22:04.900 --> 22:06.000
Oh! You don't?

22:06.133 --> 22:08.400
I'm kidding. Sort of.

22:09.433 --> 22:10.734
Sara, please come.

22:10.867 --> 22:13.600
This is our last year here--

22:13.734 --> 22:15.934
that makes it
a one-of-a-kind Christmas.

22:16.066 --> 22:17.333
Right?

22:17.467 --> 22:19.800
Well, maybe
I could use a break.

22:19.934 --> 22:20.967
You could.

22:37.266 --> 22:38.300
Anna!

22:38.433 --> 22:39.467
Sara!

22:39.600 --> 22:42.000
You have got to try
Sherry Romero's icicle churros.

22:42.133 --> 22:43.000
You two go.

22:43.133 --> 22:44.400
I'm just here
to get some fresh air.

22:44.533 --> 22:45.300
You sure?

22:45.433 --> 22:46.600
Yeah.

22:46.734 --> 22:48.500
I'll be right there.

22:48.633 --> 22:50.834
- I'll find you.
- Yeah.

23:10.367 --> 23:12.166
Thank you, thank you!

23:12.300 --> 23:13.900
Well, we're here to keep
your Christmas merry,

23:14.033 --> 23:17.300
and to add to the cheer,
here is Josh Hartman.

23:17.433 --> 23:18.834
Whoo!

23:20.033 --> 23:21.200
Thank you.

23:21.333 --> 23:23.734
All right, let's give it up
for Lynette Sparks and her band!

23:27.367 --> 23:29.667
I just wanted
to remind everyone,

23:29.800 --> 23:32.567
that we have our big Lights
Christmas Carols concert

23:32.700 --> 23:34.367
coming up
in just 12 days.

23:36.834 --> 23:37.867
Since it's been

23:38.000 --> 23:39.734
a long-running, seven-decade
tradition for this town,

23:39.867 --> 23:42.333
I better see each and every one
of you at the ticket booth,

23:42.467 --> 23:43.266
all right?

23:43.400 --> 23:44.700
All right,
you take it away, Lynette.

23:44.834 --> 23:45.900
Now wait a minute, Josh.

23:46.033 --> 23:47.834
We're not letting you
off this stage without a song!

23:47.967 --> 23:50.000
Oh, no, no, no, no.

23:50.133 --> 23:51.166
I came to see you perform.

23:51.300 --> 23:53.000
Oh, no. Come on
up here with us. Come on!

23:54.467 --> 23:56.166
Okay.

23:56.300 --> 23:58.834
Let me tell you something--
this guy can really rock.

24:09.767 --> 24:10.667
Hi.

24:10.800 --> 24:14.567
I'll... I'll take
the cinnamon-apple, please.

24:14.700 --> 24:15.633
You know what?

24:15.767 --> 24:17.600
Better make it a double.

24:17.734 --> 24:19.600
Thank you.

24:19.734 --> 24:20.900
Wow.

24:21.033 --> 24:24.900
Never seen Josh Hartman
surrender a stage before.

24:25.033 --> 24:28.233
Hey. I thought you had to work.

24:28.367 --> 24:30.066
Ah, I needed a break.

24:30.200 --> 24:33.266
Hmm. Yeah, I know that feeling.

24:33.400 --> 24:34.300
So, is that what

24:34.433 --> 24:36.600
this whole producing-the-concert
thing's about?

24:36.734 --> 24:38.567
A break from Nashville?

24:38.700 --> 24:40.233
Something like that.

24:40.367 --> 24:42.066
When my uncle called,

24:42.200 --> 24:43.567
it seemed like
a good chance for me

24:43.700 --> 24:45.900
to take a break
from the grind for awhile.

24:46.033 --> 24:46.900
Makes sense.

24:47.033 --> 24:49.233
And I bet Ted convinced the town

24:49.367 --> 24:51.900
that your Nashville success
would rub off on the concert.

24:52.033 --> 24:54.400
If only they knew.

24:54.533 --> 24:56.200
Knew what?

24:57.266 --> 24:59.734
Ahem. What'd you think of
Lynette's guitar-playing?

24:59.867 --> 25:02.467
She might be a good fit
for the concert's band.

25:02.600 --> 25:05.300
- Yeah, she's all right.
- I mean, she's no Sara Thompson.

25:05.433 --> 25:07.300
Well, you may joke,

25:07.433 --> 25:09.166
but back in the day,
we were pretty good.

25:09.300 --> 25:11.667
- Yeah.
- You especially.

25:11.800 --> 25:13.834
It's a shame you didn't take
the stage tonight.

25:13.967 --> 25:15.200
I was looking forward
to watching you.

25:15.333 --> 25:17.033
Well, I didn't come here
to sing.

25:17.166 --> 25:20.300
I came here to produce a show
with fresh talent...

25:20.433 --> 25:23.000
and fresh I am not.

25:23.133 --> 25:25.567
Oh, come on.
What are you talking about?

25:27.633 --> 25:30.033
I'd better get back
to the ticket booth.

25:30.166 --> 25:31.033
'Kay.

25:31.166 --> 25:33.800
Thanks for stepping in today.

25:33.934 --> 25:35.700
You really helped me out.

25:35.834 --> 25:40.200
Um, you start rehearsals
tomorrow, right?

25:40.333 --> 25:42.500
Did you find another pianist?

25:42.633 --> 25:46.467
Yeah, I got one solid "maybe".

25:47.667 --> 25:50.433
You want me to play?

25:51.800 --> 25:52.667
Really?

25:52.800 --> 25:55.467
Yeah.
Believe it or not, I had fun.

25:55.600 --> 25:58.433
Between the hassle of packing
and the stress of work,

25:58.567 --> 26:00.367
I could use a little fun.

26:00.500 --> 26:02.700
"Fun". Right.

26:02.834 --> 26:05.033
Yeah, I could use that, too.

26:06.166 --> 26:06.934
All right.

26:07.066 --> 26:08.800
You're on.

26:10.033 --> 26:12.000
- Goodnight.
- Night.

26:32.166 --> 26:33.967
- Oh! Hi.
- Hi.

26:34.100 --> 26:36.200
I was just dropping a book off
for my daughter

26:36.333 --> 26:37.700
and I saw these
on top of your car.

26:37.834 --> 26:39.300
I'm not sure
if you left them or--

26:39.433 --> 26:41.333
I did, I did. Gosh.

26:41.467 --> 26:42.667
Oh, please, come in.

26:42.800 --> 26:43.500
Okay.

26:43.633 --> 26:45.033
Can you put them right there?

26:45.166 --> 26:46.133
Yeah, for sure.

26:46.266 --> 26:48.633
Oh! Thank you.

26:48.767 --> 26:49.667
You're welcome.

26:49.800 --> 26:51.033
I swear, I'd forget my head.

26:52.333 --> 26:54.333
I was just putting away
some china.

26:54.467 --> 26:56.800
Oh, my mother used
to have some nice china.

26:56.934 --> 26:59.333
I re-surfaced all
her cabinet doors with glass,

26:59.467 --> 27:00.767
so she could see them.

27:00.900 --> 27:02.033
Oh, that sounds lovely.

27:02.166 --> 27:04.200
Actually, I'm doing
the same thing

27:04.333 --> 27:05.867
for Caity right now,

27:06.000 --> 27:07.100
and I'd be happy to do yours,
if you like.

27:07.233 --> 27:08.934
Oh. Heh.

27:09.066 --> 27:10.400
W-Well, thank you,

27:10.533 --> 27:11.934
b-but, no, I'm fine.

27:13.567 --> 27:16.500
Okay. No, I understand.

27:16.633 --> 27:18.533
Hoo! I was bound
to be bad at this.

27:18.667 --> 27:20.533
Bad at what?

27:20.667 --> 27:21.600
Pitching myself
as a carpenter--

27:21.734 --> 27:23.100
which I was for a while
in my 20s,

27:23.233 --> 27:25.367
till I became an oil rigger.

27:25.500 --> 27:27.400
I get it.

27:27.533 --> 27:29.200
I know what starting over
feels like.

27:29.333 --> 27:32.967
Yeah. Bet you handled it
better than I do.

27:35.834 --> 27:37.967
George?

27:39.667 --> 27:40.600
Do you think you could

27:40.734 --> 27:43.400
do the interior of the cabinets
in a cream?

27:43.533 --> 27:44.767
Absolutely.

27:44.900 --> 27:46.767
- Well, that'd be great.
- Okay!

27:47.900 --> 27:49.600
I'll-- I'll see you soon.

27:49.734 --> 27:51.166
- Okay. Sounds good.
- Okay.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.000
♪ And heav'n
And nature sing ♪

27:57.133 --> 27:59.266

And heav'n ♪

28:01.734 --> 28:03.767
♪ And nature sing

28:03.900 --> 28:05.333
Okay. That was great.

28:05.467 --> 28:08.100
Um, I'd like to try something.

28:08.233 --> 28:09.867
Maybe we should
harmonize the chorus.

28:11.600 --> 28:13.967
Sara? Could we maybe show them?

28:14.100 --> 28:15.500
- Yeah, sure.
- Why don't you start

28:15.633 --> 28:16.500
at the refrain?

28:16.633 --> 28:18.266
And I was thinking
I could take the melody

28:18.400 --> 28:19.967
and you do
a lower harmony?

28:20.100 --> 28:21.266
That's a great idea.

28:21.400 --> 28:22.233
Okay.

28:24.967 --> 28:27.600

- We can do that.

28:57.600 --> 28:59.100
Okay. Great.

29:00.200 --> 29:01.333
Sara?

29:01.467 --> 29:03.000
I just--
I wanted to say thanks.

29:03.133 --> 29:04.400
For what?

29:04.533 --> 29:06.000
For making me
look good in there.

29:06.133 --> 29:08.333
I'm supposed to be
the big Nashville pro.

29:08.467 --> 29:09.533
What are you talking about?

29:09.667 --> 29:11.000
Harmonizing was your idea.

29:11.133 --> 29:12.367
And do you realize

29:12.500 --> 29:15.033
that no one's heard us sing
in nearly a decade?

29:15.166 --> 29:16.166
That's crazy, right?

29:16.300 --> 29:18.000
I didn't feel the rust at all.

29:18.133 --> 29:19.066
Same.

29:19.200 --> 29:21.233
How did you feel?

29:21.367 --> 29:24.000
Uh, kind of liberated?

29:24.133 --> 29:26.433
Yeah. Music'll do that.

29:28.533 --> 29:30.333
I owe you an apology.

29:30.467 --> 29:32.233
For the way I left.

29:32.367 --> 29:35.033
I should have told you that
I got a scholarship offer,

29:35.166 --> 29:37.166
and that I was considering it.

29:38.467 --> 29:40.266
Yeah, you should have.

29:41.467 --> 29:43.667
I just chickened out...

29:43.800 --> 29:45.967
and that's inexcusable.

29:46.100 --> 29:48.133
Yeah. It kinda was.

29:49.367 --> 29:52.166
It was the hardest decision
that I've ever had to make.

29:52.300 --> 29:55.800
I knew
I'd be disappointing you,

29:55.934 --> 29:57.500
but I was afraid
if I told you,

29:57.633 --> 29:59.500
that you would
talk me out of it,

29:59.633 --> 30:03.367
and then I'd be
letting other people down.

30:03.500 --> 30:04.600
Like who?

30:05.433 --> 30:07.200
My teachers...

30:07.333 --> 30:08.600
my family.

30:10.667 --> 30:12.400
Well, I mean...

30:12.533 --> 30:14.867
it is a shame
I wasn't on that list.

30:15.000 --> 30:16.567
Honestly?

30:16.700 --> 30:18.500
I just thought, somehow,

30:18.633 --> 30:21.200
we would always stay together,
no matter what.

30:21.333 --> 30:22.734
What can I say?

30:22.867 --> 30:25.333
I'd never been in love before.

30:25.467 --> 30:27.767
Me neither.

30:30.633 --> 30:31.734
Sara!

30:31.867 --> 30:33.667
Don't forget my Christmas
party's tomorrow night!

30:33.800 --> 30:35.800
Remind your mom, too!

30:35.934 --> 30:37.667
I-I will!
I hope we can make it!

30:40.800 --> 30:42.166
You hope?

30:42.300 --> 30:45.000
My Uncle Ted'll be crushed
if you guys don't show.

30:45.133 --> 30:48.200
We have to pack
and I'm working on this appeal.

30:48.333 --> 30:50.834
I can't just brush it off
and hope for the best, so.

30:50.967 --> 30:52.066
You know what?

30:52.200 --> 30:53.867
I think maybe you're just afraid
to trust your own talent.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.166
Mm, says the guy
who wouldn't sing on stage

30:56.300 --> 30:57.400
at Santa Jam.

30:59.367 --> 31:01.734
All right, look, I need to post
the rest of the schedule.

31:01.867 --> 31:03.367
Okay.

31:15.100 --> 31:17.300
♪ Joy to the world

31:17.433 --> 31:19.633
♪ Mm-hmm-hmm-hmm-mm

31:19.767 --> 31:23.133
♪ And heav'n and nature sing

31:23.266 --> 31:24.400
Well, someone's happy!

31:24.533 --> 31:25.934
What's gotten into you?

31:27.200 --> 31:29.567
I did a little singing
at rehearsal, with Josh.

31:29.700 --> 31:31.600
Oh, really? How lovely.

31:31.734 --> 31:32.633
Can you hand me that?

31:32.767 --> 31:33.600
Yeah.

31:33.734 --> 31:34.767
How did it feel?

31:34.900 --> 31:36.600
It was fun,
don't get me wrong,

31:36.734 --> 31:40.400
but it's also sad,
just thinking about everything.

31:40.533 --> 31:43.467
You mean having to choose
between Josh and college?

31:43.600 --> 31:44.400
No-- yeah.

31:44.533 --> 31:47.233
Josh, and making music.

31:47.367 --> 31:49.467
You know, I made that decision,

31:49.600 --> 31:53.200
and went back and forth
a million times in my head,

31:53.333 --> 31:56.100
over the years,
wondering if I made a mistake...

31:56.233 --> 31:58.900
was I ever even good enough
to make it?

31:59.033 --> 32:00.633
Did you think I was good?

32:00.767 --> 32:02.367
Honey, I thought
you were extraordinary.

32:02.500 --> 32:05.533
Did you say that to me
back then?

32:05.667 --> 32:07.133
I'm sure I did.

32:07.266 --> 32:10.800
I know it was a tough time,
but you chose wisely.

32:10.934 --> 32:13.166
Well, I chose
what you wanted me to choose,

32:13.300 --> 32:14.834
so you're a little bit biased.

32:14.967 --> 32:16.967
Well, look how well
how it turned out.

32:17.100 --> 32:19.400
If you say so.

32:21.166 --> 32:23.000
Uh, I have some work to do,
so I'll see you later.

32:23.133 --> 32:23.867
Okay.

32:32.600 --> 32:33.834
Good morning, Sara.

32:33.967 --> 32:36.200
I didn't sleep well last night.

32:36.333 --> 32:39.300
Oh, well,
that's not like you.

32:39.433 --> 32:41.867
I couldn't stop thinking
about what you said.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.033
Sara, years ago,

32:43.166 --> 32:45.567
I never meant
to make your decision for you.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.800
That's what it felt like.

32:48.934 --> 32:51.967
I'd lived a life
in music,

32:52.100 --> 32:54.133
and I knew it was hard.

32:54.266 --> 32:56.300
I understand.

32:56.433 --> 32:57.367
Very sensible.

32:57.500 --> 33:01.033
And now I can afford
to pay my bills

33:01.166 --> 33:02.700
and a whole lot more,

33:02.834 --> 33:05.066
and, uh...

33:05.200 --> 33:07.767
what if I've missed out
on my best life?

33:07.900 --> 33:09.133
Oh, Sara...

33:10.200 --> 33:12.867
I'm sorry.
I-I don't have time for this.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.700
I've got to get back to work,

33:14.834 --> 33:16.734
you've got to drop stuff off
at the condo, right?

33:16.867 --> 33:18.700
Yeah, a bunch of linens
and stuff.

33:21.400 --> 33:23.367
Go. I'll be fine.

33:25.200 --> 33:26.166
Okay.

33:35.400 --> 33:38.867
Don't worry about the dishes!
I'll do them later!

33:39.000 --> 33:40.567
- Oh. Hi!
- Hi!

33:40.700 --> 33:43.033
You must be Anna.
I'm Caitlin Brooks.

33:43.166 --> 33:44.033
George's daughter.

33:44.166 --> 33:46.100
It's so nice to meet you.

33:46.233 --> 33:47.233
Oh, Dad has been saying

33:47.367 --> 33:49.233
how lucky I am
to have you as a neighbor.

33:49.367 --> 33:50.200
Has he, now?

33:50.333 --> 33:51.734
Well, I guess
I'll just have to try

33:51.867 --> 33:52.867
to live up to his opinion.

33:53.967 --> 33:55.700
- Oh...
- Hey! We have to hurry.

33:55.834 --> 33:57.200
Do you have the cookies
for the assembly?

33:57.333 --> 33:59.367
A fellow teacher and neighbor.
I've got 'em.

33:59.500 --> 34:00.767
Sprinkles and sugar, both.

34:00.900 --> 34:02.800
I said chocolate-frosted.

34:02.934 --> 34:03.967
No chocolate-frosted,

34:04.100 --> 34:05.767
and Susie Braun's mom is gonna
put me in a timeout.

34:05.900 --> 34:06.834
Leonard, Leonard!

34:06.967 --> 34:08.767
You are bringing
the chocolate-frosted.

34:09.800 --> 34:11.166
I'm bringing
the chocolate-frosted.

34:11.300 --> 34:13.600
- Uh-huh.
- Yes! Yes. That's what I said.

34:13.734 --> 34:16.600
Okay. Nice to meet you!

34:16.734 --> 34:18.567
Nice to meet you.

34:21.633 --> 34:22.734
She's lovely.

34:22.867 --> 34:24.934
Yeah, I think so, too.

34:25.066 --> 34:27.233
Is it too soon
to start your cabinets?

34:27.367 --> 34:28.600
Um...

34:28.734 --> 34:30.600
No. That would be fine.

34:30.734 --> 34:33.433
Okay. Great.

34:44.600 --> 34:45.800
Hi.

34:45.934 --> 34:48.100
Hey.
What are you doing here?

34:48.233 --> 34:50.100
I, uh, needed
to stretch my legs

34:50.233 --> 34:51.600
before they went numb.

34:51.734 --> 34:52.767
Whatcha doing?

34:52.900 --> 34:53.934
Yeah, I believe

34:54.066 --> 34:55.934
there's a cherished
theatrical term for this--

34:56.066 --> 34:56.967
"grunt work".

34:58.233 --> 35:00.500
It's my attempt at a set
on a shoestring budget.

35:01.834 --> 35:04.533
Yeah, a year ago,
I was playing national tours.

35:04.667 --> 35:07.767
Now look--
painting snowflakes.

35:08.800 --> 35:11.834
What really happened
with your music, Josh?

35:15.100 --> 35:17.133
Uh...

35:18.633 --> 35:21.333
...the national tours
were for headliners.

35:21.467 --> 35:23.333
I was just in the band.

35:23.467 --> 35:25.166
And I got frustrated,

35:25.300 --> 35:27.000
I decided to go
all-in on myself,

35:27.133 --> 35:28.834
before it was too late.

35:28.967 --> 35:30.000
Too late?

35:30.133 --> 35:32.166
What were you, 29?

35:32.300 --> 35:33.667
Oh, come on,
there are tons of guys

35:33.800 --> 35:36.333
in the "Home
for Retired Musicians" by 29.

35:36.467 --> 35:38.333
Yeah, I said no
to every single job

35:38.467 --> 35:41.000
and I spent every dime I had
on my solo career.

35:41.133 --> 35:42.500
And?

35:42.633 --> 35:44.333
Oh, radio silence...

35:44.467 --> 35:47.834
until I landed this gig
at the best club in town.

35:47.967 --> 35:49.667
- Nice!
- Yeah, you would think.

35:49.800 --> 35:51.066
But...

35:51.200 --> 35:53.633
right before signing,
they changed bookers,

35:53.767 --> 35:54.667
and I was out.

35:54.800 --> 35:55.734
But hey--

35:55.867 --> 35:56.667
best thing
that could've happened

35:56.800 --> 35:57.834
to my painting career.

35:59.500 --> 36:02.200
Um, I can stick around
and help out, if you want.

36:02.333 --> 36:04.066
Don't you have a lot of work
to do at your mom's?

36:04.200 --> 36:05.934
Mm, yeah, I'm slammed, but...

36:06.066 --> 36:07.967
No, you'll be more productive
there than here.

36:08.100 --> 36:10.300
I really don't mind staying.

36:10.433 --> 36:11.934
Sara?

36:12.066 --> 36:14.100
You're the one
that has a real career.

36:14.233 --> 36:16.467
You have a real career, too.

36:16.600 --> 36:17.934
Yeah, sure.

36:18.066 --> 36:20.967
Legions of adoring fans,
wherever I turn.

36:21.100 --> 36:23.433
Come on.
That's just fame.

36:23.567 --> 36:25.567
What happened to the guy I knew

36:25.700 --> 36:29.166
who was just in it
because he loved the process?

36:32.900 --> 36:36.000
Please, just go.

36:37.266 --> 36:39.200
Okay.

37:00.233 --> 37:01.900
They're lovely!

37:02.033 --> 37:04.934
Really beautiful.
Thank you, George.

37:05.066 --> 37:06.233
You're welcome.

37:06.367 --> 37:08.433
They still need to be painted,

37:08.567 --> 37:11.233
but maybe you can be
my second reference.

37:11.367 --> 37:13.200
I've got Caity,
but everybody knows

37:13.333 --> 37:15.166
your daughter'll
vouch for you, right?

37:18.333 --> 37:19.700
Something wrong?

37:19.834 --> 37:22.200
No. No, everything is fine.

37:22.333 --> 37:23.700
What do I owe you
for the cabinets?

37:23.834 --> 37:25.033
Oh, come on.

37:25.166 --> 37:26.400
Something's going on.

37:26.533 --> 37:29.867
It's either family or job.
Which is it?

37:30.000 --> 37:31.233
Oh, it's just

37:31.367 --> 37:32.700
I'm working through something
with my daughter.

37:32.834 --> 37:34.266
Oh...

37:34.400 --> 37:35.734
Oh, I'm sorry, George.

37:35.867 --> 37:38.100
I should just keep moving down
my Christmas to-do list.

37:38.233 --> 37:39.867
Let me pay you for the cabinets.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.266
If you want to pay me back,

37:41.400 --> 37:42.533
why don't you just educate me

37:42.667 --> 37:45.100
on the highlights
of an Oakcrest Christmas?

37:45.233 --> 37:47.233
Have you been
to the Knothole Diner yet?

37:47.367 --> 37:48.533
No.

37:48.667 --> 37:50.633
It's almost noon.
How about lunch?

37:53.166 --> 37:55.533
No, I really should get back--

37:55.667 --> 37:56.967
Well, don't you eat lunch?

37:57.867 --> 38:00.934
No, I...
Yes, I do, I eat lunch.

38:01.066 --> 38:03.000
Well, good,
'cause I just heard of

38:03.133 --> 38:04.667
a great diner
we could check out.

38:07.266 --> 38:09.633
So, where did
you move here from, George?

38:09.767 --> 38:11.467
I came here from Iowa.

38:11.600 --> 38:14.166
Most of my work was out of town.

38:14.300 --> 38:15.633
Oh.

38:15.767 --> 38:19.100
The long hours away got to be
too much for my ex-wife.

38:20.400 --> 38:25.100
When Caity moved here,
I realized that...

38:25.233 --> 38:26.934
I needed to follow.

38:27.066 --> 38:29.266
Get to know
my daughter again,

38:29.400 --> 38:31.100
make up for lost time.

38:31.233 --> 38:33.033
How's that going?

38:33.934 --> 38:35.266
It's getting there.

38:35.400 --> 38:37.867
It's never easy,
making up for past mistakes.

38:38.800 --> 38:40.367
You speaking first-hand?

38:43.233 --> 38:46.333
Sara threw me
a curve yesterday.

38:46.467 --> 38:50.433
You know, back in high school,
she had to make a career choice.

38:50.567 --> 38:51.767
I remember trying so hard

38:51.900 --> 38:54.633
to advise without pushing...

38:54.767 --> 38:56.633
But?

38:56.767 --> 38:59.266
Now I'm not sure
she's happy with her decision,

38:59.400 --> 39:02.333
or if I was objective enough.

39:02.467 --> 39:04.200
Ahh, well,
it's a rare species--

39:04.333 --> 39:05.834
an objective mother.

39:07.333 --> 39:09.900
You know,
her father was a musician.

39:10.033 --> 39:11.700
We nearly ended up broke.

39:11.834 --> 39:16.166
Being a performer
became like a bad dream to me.

39:16.300 --> 39:17.667
It still is.

39:17.800 --> 39:19.500
Well...

39:19.633 --> 39:23.066
no one gives you a book
on how to be the perfect parent.

39:23.200 --> 39:24.667
The way I look at it,

39:24.800 --> 39:26.734
you just stay
in the batter's box

39:26.867 --> 39:28.667
and keep on swinging.

39:28.800 --> 39:31.834
We only get so much time
with the ones we love.

39:31.967 --> 39:33.633
That's so true.

39:34.834 --> 39:36.333
You're pushing those my way.

39:36.467 --> 39:37.734
I am.
Would you like to try one?

39:37.867 --> 39:39.633
- Absolutely!
- I can't eat another bite.

40:57.633 --> 40:58.834
Thank you so much.

40:58.967 --> 41:00.133
I may be Mike Thompson--

41:00.266 --> 41:01.767
it is my name
on the drum kit--

41:01.900 --> 41:03.567
but here's the real star
of the band

41:03.700 --> 41:04.600
and my life--

41:04.734 --> 41:05.900
Anna Thompson.

I've never heard
you sing like that.

42:04.934 --> 42:07.000
I'd forgotten about that recording.

42:07.133 --> 42:08.967
You were good.

42:09.100 --> 42:10.300
Really good!

42:11.266 --> 42:12.967
It's from another life.

42:13.100 --> 42:14.633
♪ O, hear the angel voices--

42:15.800 --> 42:17.200
Was that life so terrible?

42:17.333 --> 42:19.934
It sure didn't sound like it,
from the tape.

42:20.066 --> 42:22.567
How did you
leave all that behind?

42:25.100 --> 42:28.200
Because we had
to survive, honey.

42:28.333 --> 42:29.667
Uh, for some reason,
I had it in my head

42:29.800 --> 42:31.700
that you would
just sing backup for Dad,

42:31.834 --> 42:34.233
but you were
so much more than that.

42:35.266 --> 42:37.433
Did you guys
write together, too?

42:37.567 --> 42:39.133
How did you even meet?

42:39.266 --> 42:42.133
Th-There are so many things
that you've never told me!

42:48.600 --> 42:50.734
I met your father...

42:52.300 --> 42:54.467
...at a Lights Carols
Christmas Concert.

42:56.834 --> 42:57.867
I never knew that.

42:58.000 --> 42:58.967
Yeah.

42:59.100 --> 43:03.033
He'd come down from Nashville
with a band.

43:03.166 --> 43:05.834
There is such a thing
as love at first sight.

43:05.967 --> 43:06.867
By the next Christmas,

43:07.000 --> 43:09.867
we were married
and on the road together.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.266
Then you came along.

43:12.400 --> 43:14.533
Life wasn't perfect...

43:14.667 --> 43:17.834
but it was filled
with music and love.

43:19.166 --> 43:20.867
Until it wasn't?

43:21.834 --> 43:24.033
Until it wasn't.

43:24.166 --> 43:26.734
Until that night
when your father's car

43:26.867 --> 43:29.700
skidded off the road
in that terrible rain,

43:29.834 --> 43:31.834
and then that life was over.

43:33.700 --> 43:37.200
And next came the hard part.

43:37.333 --> 43:39.367
Struggling and scrimping,

43:39.500 --> 43:42.100
and just trying to put one foot
in front of the other,

43:42.233 --> 43:44.233
and keep us going.

43:44.367 --> 43:46.066
But you did.

43:46.200 --> 43:47.367
You saved us.

43:52.166 --> 43:54.567
Honey, I guess
I was just always afraid

43:54.700 --> 43:56.967
that lightning
could strike again.

43:57.867 --> 44:00.133
When you were
a senior in high school,

44:00.266 --> 44:02.834
I saw you following
in my footsteps.

44:02.967 --> 44:05.100
Falling in love
with a handsome musician,

44:05.233 --> 44:08.934
imagining a fairytale life
in music...

44:10.367 --> 44:14.633
...and I was just so afraid

44:14.767 --> 44:18.166
that something like that
could happen to you,

44:18.300 --> 44:21.100
and I wanted to protect you.

44:23.400 --> 44:27.166
Well, hearing all this
helps me understand.

44:27.300 --> 44:28.867
Thanks for that.

44:30.467 --> 44:32.600
I am sorry, honey.

44:33.567 --> 44:36.367
I really should have
told you this sooner.

44:37.800 --> 44:40.767
Uh, you should
get ready for Ted's party.

44:40.900 --> 44:41.767
"We".

44:41.900 --> 44:43.934
We should go get ready
for Ted's party.

44:44.066 --> 44:46.600
Uh, no, I cannot go.
I have to work to do.

44:46.734 --> 44:47.767
- What?
- Yeah.

44:47.900 --> 44:50.100
Ted Ramsey is one of
this family's best friends.

44:50.233 --> 44:51.934
Yeah, but if I get
my brief done now,

44:52.066 --> 44:54.934
then it means we have
more time together tomorrow

44:55.066 --> 44:56.100
- to pack.
- Packing?

44:56.233 --> 44:57.633
It's just packing!

44:57.767 --> 45:00.433
I-- I don't have anything
to wear, either.

45:01.834 --> 45:04.233
I think I can fix that.

45:04.367 --> 45:05.367
Come on!

45:05.500 --> 45:06.967
Come, come, come!

45:09.633 --> 45:10.734
Open it.

45:10.867 --> 45:12.567
It's not Christmas.

45:12.700 --> 45:14.133
Well, we got a tree,
we got stockings--

45:14.266 --> 45:16.300
it's close enough.

45:17.333 --> 45:19.000
Oh...

45:19.133 --> 45:21.734
Mom! It's beautiful.

45:21.867 --> 45:24.200
Well, I'm a single mother
in a small town

45:24.333 --> 45:26.667
who doesn't get to see
her daughter nearly enough,

45:26.800 --> 45:27.867
and who worries

45:28.000 --> 45:30.700
that her daughter doesn't have
nearly enough fun.

45:30.834 --> 45:34.667
Well, it's more than enough
just to be home, helping you.

45:34.800 --> 45:36.333
This is me helping you back.

45:36.467 --> 45:39.000
And that's all I ever want
for Christmas.

45:39.133 --> 45:40.567
Oh, it's so pretty.

45:40.700 --> 45:43.433
I can't wait to see it on you.
Come on, let's go.

45:56.467 --> 45:57.333
You know this isn't

45:57.467 --> 45:58.800
an ugly Christmas sweater
party, right?

45:58.934 --> 46:00.500
- Yeah, I know.
- Okay.

46:12.967 --> 46:15.934
Sara! Hi!
Come say hi to the Johnsons.

46:25.467 --> 46:27.500
Hey! Christmas music.

46:27.633 --> 46:31.033
You know, we should all sing.
Um, can anyone play?

46:31.166 --> 46:32.633
Oh, you want singing?

46:32.767 --> 46:35.734
I heard Sara and Josh
singing at rehearsal.

46:35.867 --> 46:37.500
They're dynamite!

46:37.633 --> 46:38.834
Oh, no, no.

46:38.967 --> 46:40.834
Yeah. "Sara and Josh!"

46:40.967 --> 46:42.367
Sara and Josh!

46:45.500 --> 46:46.800
Sara and Josh!

46:51.533 --> 46:53.300
Ahem.

47:02.400 --> 47:07.467

One more!

47:57.567 --> 47:58.433
I gotta get going.

47:58.567 --> 48:01.166
Oh, Josh!
Would Sonny desert Cher?

48:01.300 --> 48:02.166
I have to open the theater

48:02.300 --> 48:04.000
for a guy
who's delivering the lights.

48:04.133 --> 48:05.300
Tonight?

48:05.433 --> 48:06.767
Yeah.
Yeah, he's doing me a favor.

48:08.333 --> 48:09.800
Besides, you don't--
you don't need me.

48:09.934 --> 48:11.467
You all have the real deal
right here--

48:11.600 --> 48:12.834
give it up for Sara Thompson!

48:12.967 --> 48:15.533
Whoo!

48:18.133 --> 48:20.533
- I told you they were great!
- No, they were fantastic.

49:03.367 --> 49:05.700
How're the lights coming along?

49:05.834 --> 49:07.033
Uh, work in progress.

49:07.166 --> 49:09.700
Well, at least there was
a light delivery tonight.

49:09.834 --> 49:11.367
That sounded super-fake.

49:11.500 --> 49:13.600
Yeah, about that, um...

49:13.734 --> 49:16.033
...they were
actually delivered this morning.

49:17.700 --> 49:19.800
Why did you leave
the party, then?

49:22.166 --> 49:24.633
Uh, because I realized...

49:25.734 --> 49:26.734
...after singing together again,

49:26.867 --> 49:29.567
I will never be as good solo
as we were together.

49:29.700 --> 49:32.100
That is all in your head.

49:32.233 --> 49:34.100
It's not true.

49:35.200 --> 49:37.967
Believe it or not,
I really have to get this done.

49:43.200 --> 49:46.934
You know, my mom and dad met
at the Lights Carols concert--

49:47.066 --> 49:48.266
right here,

49:48.400 --> 49:50.066
34 years ago.

49:50.200 --> 49:51.700
I didn't know that.

49:51.834 --> 49:53.033
Mm.

49:53.166 --> 49:54.700
When I was five,

49:54.834 --> 49:58.033
my dad wrote my mom
a Christmas song.

49:58.166 --> 50:00.467
She was gonna play it
in that year's concert.

50:01.700 --> 50:04.000
But by December,
we'd lost him.

50:05.033 --> 50:06.834
What happened to the song?

50:09.700 --> 50:11.500
I just found it.

50:13.066 --> 50:15.033
Where are you going with this?

50:15.166 --> 50:18.367
What if it were played
in this year's concert?

50:18.500 --> 50:19.867
Are you serious?

50:20.000 --> 50:22.033
You think you could ever
convince your mom to sing again?

50:22.166 --> 50:24.200
No, absolutely not.

50:24.333 --> 50:26.166
But...

50:26.300 --> 50:28.033
what if we did it?

50:28.900 --> 50:29.934
You and me.

50:30.066 --> 50:32.266
That's-- that's crazy.

50:32.400 --> 50:34.200
That... Uh...

50:34.333 --> 50:36.066
but it...

50:36.200 --> 50:37.867
might actually work.

50:39.834 --> 50:41.233
Are you sure
you want to do this?

50:41.367 --> 50:43.233
I want to dedicate it
to my parents...

50:43.367 --> 50:44.600
show my mom that...

50:44.734 --> 50:48.266
even though dreams don't always
come true the way you imagine,

50:48.400 --> 50:51.166
doesn't mean
you should give up on them.

50:53.567 --> 50:54.967
I can relate to that.

51:07.300 --> 51:08.333
All right, I am off

51:08.467 --> 51:10.100
to go do some work with Josh
at the theater.

51:10.233 --> 51:11.433
Okay!

51:11.567 --> 51:13.266
I like this.

51:13.400 --> 51:14.667
What?

51:14.800 --> 51:16.433
You know--
energy, smiling.

51:16.567 --> 51:17.934
Please.
It is just the caffeine, okay?

51:18.066 --> 51:19.266
Got to go!

51:22.734 --> 51:24.033
Well, have fun!

All of my dad's cassettes
are amazing.

52:30.500 --> 52:32.834
I want to listen
to every one of 'em.

52:32.967 --> 52:35.266
And then, there's...
this.

52:41.633 --> 52:43.166
Wow!

52:43.300 --> 52:45.000
This is incredible.

52:45.133 --> 52:46.700
I'm telling you--
we can crush it.

52:48.633 --> 52:50.367
Sara...

52:50.500 --> 52:53.233
this song--

52:53.367 --> 52:56.333
it's your family's legacy.

52:56.467 --> 52:59.066
If this performance
is for your mom...

52:59.200 --> 53:00.734
I think
you should sing it solo.

53:00.867 --> 53:02.633
No, I could not
begin to do that.

53:02.767 --> 53:05.800
You want your mom to rediscover
the thrill of music, right?

53:05.934 --> 53:06.900
- Yeah.
- Well,

53:07.033 --> 53:08.233
what's stronger
than if it comes from you?

53:08.367 --> 53:11.867
We... are stronger, together.

53:12.867 --> 53:14.734
You said that. Remember?

53:15.867 --> 53:17.000
Yeah.

53:28.934 --> 53:30.800
Now remember, Ellie,
on this one,

53:30.934 --> 53:32.967
just try to have fun, okay?

53:33.100 --> 53:34.133
- Okay!
- Okay.

53:34.266 --> 53:36.000
All right. Watch me.
I'll count you in, okay?

53:36.133 --> 53:37.266
Okay.

53:44.166 --> 53:46.033

It's "branches,"
right, Ellie?

53:57.600 --> 53:59.700
I know,
but I just keep forgetting.

53:59.834 --> 54:02.300
Okay, uh...

54:03.467 --> 54:04.400
Tell you what.

54:04.533 --> 54:05.600
If you forget again,

54:05.734 --> 54:07.367
why don't you just take a peak
at the Christmas tree

54:07.500 --> 54:08.567
and it'll help you remember.

54:08.700 --> 54:11.066
That's not a Christmas tree!
That's a piece of wood.

54:14.166 --> 54:15.700
That's fair.

54:15.834 --> 54:16.734
O-Okay, kiddo.

54:16.867 --> 54:18.100
There's Mom and Dad.

54:18.233 --> 54:19.867
That's it for today.

54:20.000 --> 54:21.066
I'll see you
next rehearsal, okay?

54:21.200 --> 54:22.400
Bye!

54:22.533 --> 54:24.266
I'm proud of you, Ellie!
The words will come.

54:24.400 --> 54:26.200
You're gonna be fine!

54:26.333 --> 54:28.867
Me, however? Total breakdown.

54:34.000 --> 54:35.033
Hi, Mr. Clarkson.

54:35.166 --> 54:36.700
Hey, Josh. Sara.

54:36.834 --> 54:39.033
We need a Christmas tree--

54:39.166 --> 54:40.867
14... 16 feet at least?

54:41.000 --> 54:42.800
Oh, we're sold out of
all the ones that big.

54:44.333 --> 54:45.867
What would you guys do
with a tree that size, anyway?

54:46.000 --> 54:48.233
On stage,
for the Lights Carols Concert.

54:48.367 --> 54:50.200
Anyway, thanks.

54:50.333 --> 54:51.600
You know, wait--

54:51.734 --> 54:54.700
I do have one about that size,
down by the pond.

54:54.834 --> 54:56.066
I was gonna save it
for next year, but...

54:56.200 --> 54:58.734
you're a good man, Josh,
taking over the concert.

54:58.867 --> 55:00.133
You know, if you come back
later this evening,

55:00.266 --> 55:03.000
that'd give me time to cut it
and have it ready to haul.

55:03.133 --> 55:06.367
Fantastic!
Uh, we will be back.

55:09.066 --> 55:11.433
Your mom
sounded great on tape.

55:11.567 --> 55:12.934
Yeah, she did.

55:13.066 --> 55:15.433
Kinda reminded me of
the first time I heard you sing,

55:15.567 --> 55:16.600
in sixth grade.

55:16.734 --> 55:18.166
Oh, please.
You were way too busy

55:18.300 --> 55:20.633
chasing around Amanda Dobbs
in the sixth grade.

55:20.767 --> 55:22.066
No way.

55:22.200 --> 55:24.834
Amanda couldn't harmonize
like you.

55:24.967 --> 55:27.700
Nobody was better than
the two of us together, huh?

55:28.900 --> 55:31.100
Are you ready for this?
The moment of truth?

55:31.233 --> 55:32.533
All right, hit me.

55:34.066 --> 55:36.300
Wow! It's perfect.

55:44.967 --> 55:46.433
This is crazy.

55:46.567 --> 55:48.600
You need crazy in your life.

55:48.734 --> 55:50.967
I've... been
having fun with you and-and--

55:51.100 --> 55:53.467
I mean, everybody enjoys
a blast from the past,

55:53.600 --> 55:55.967
- but that's what it is--
- Hey, Sara, are you happy?

55:56.100 --> 55:57.667
I'm content.

55:57.800 --> 55:59.667
Yeah? You could've fooled me.

56:01.467 --> 56:02.633
Um...

56:04.467 --> 56:05.500
Uh...

56:05.633 --> 56:07.266
we should call it a night.

56:08.200 --> 56:10.000
Uh... yeah.

56:32.166 --> 56:34.066
Mom, I have to finish this
for my office somehow,

56:34.200 --> 56:36.166
before I'm at the theater
by five.

56:36.300 --> 56:37.367
I will be in my cell.

56:37.500 --> 56:39.333
Okay.

56:48.467 --> 56:49.333
Hello?

56:49.467 --> 56:51.367
Hey. Yeah,
I heard you mentioning

56:51.500 --> 56:52.734
you're gonna move some stuff
out of your garage

56:52.867 --> 56:53.834
tomorrow morning--

56:53.967 --> 56:55.500
I'd like to offer my truck.

56:55.633 --> 56:57.367
Oh, George, that's so sweet,

56:57.500 --> 56:59.700
but you've done so much
for me already.

56:59.834 --> 57:01.266
I'm starting to feel guilty.

57:01.400 --> 57:03.400
Ah, I like doing things for ya.

57:03.533 --> 57:04.266
Oh...

57:04.400 --> 57:06.233
okay, well, that'd be great.

57:06.367 --> 57:09.667
Yeah, I'll, uh,
I'll see you tomorrow.

57:14.033 --> 57:15.633
What are we doing
at the high school?

57:15.767 --> 57:17.133
Is this even legal?

57:17.266 --> 57:20.233
Oh, I'm not worried.
I hear you're a great lawyer.

57:20.367 --> 57:22.400
Josh...

57:22.533 --> 57:24.567
Relax. The Mayor gave me
a spare key,

57:24.700 --> 57:26.934
in case we needed
some extra rehearsal space.

57:27.066 --> 57:29.033
Unbelievable.

57:29.166 --> 57:32.967
This hasn't changed at all
since we were in high school!

57:33.100 --> 57:35.066
Where it all started,
for you and me.

57:35.200 --> 57:36.233
Hmm.

57:36.367 --> 57:37.633
You sat there.

57:37.767 --> 57:39.133
Way too close to Amanda Dobbs!

57:39.266 --> 57:40.400
Come on.

57:40.533 --> 57:42.433
It was only platonic.
I swear.

57:42.567 --> 57:44.567
And I would always sit...

57:44.700 --> 57:46.266
Wait. Where is the piano?

57:46.400 --> 57:47.567
It's out for service.

57:47.700 --> 57:48.900
Some sort of incident

57:49.033 --> 57:51.400
with a stumble
and a cartwheeling tuba.

57:51.533 --> 57:53.600
And so how
are we supposed to rehearse

57:53.734 --> 57:55.567
with no piano?

57:58.700 --> 58:00.300
Sit down.

58:00.433 --> 58:01.900
Take a seat.

58:11.500 --> 58:12.867
Sour gummy worms?

58:13.000 --> 58:14.367
Our ritual, remember?

58:14.500 --> 58:16.467
Whenever you got nervous
about one of our shows--

58:16.600 --> 58:19.433
which was, like, always...

58:19.567 --> 58:22.100
You would steer me here
to the band room,

58:22.233 --> 58:23.467
we'd eat a whole bag

58:23.600 --> 58:25.133
until I blissed out
and was ready to play

58:25.266 --> 58:26.600
for the King of England.

58:26.734 --> 58:28.000
Worked every time.

58:28.133 --> 58:29.133
And here I thought,

58:29.266 --> 58:30.166
when you stopped
at the drug store,

58:30.300 --> 58:31.800
you were really
just after cough drops.

58:31.934 --> 58:34.000
Ahh. Cover story.

58:34.133 --> 58:35.867
Mm.

58:36.000 --> 58:38.500
Admit it. You kind of
feel like a kid again, hmm?

58:38.633 --> 58:39.967
A kid?

58:40.100 --> 58:42.133
After a decade of hard work?

58:42.266 --> 58:44.967
Funny, I've never thought
of music that way.

58:45.100 --> 58:47.967
Mm. Your career's
no cakewalk either.

58:49.500 --> 58:51.433
True.

58:52.834 --> 58:54.200
Look.

58:54.333 --> 58:57.633
There's the school's
band-practice schedule.

59:01.867 --> 59:04.567
I remember, your mom
used to slip the schedule

59:04.700 --> 59:05.700
into your backpack--

59:05.834 --> 59:07.066
drove you crazy.

59:07.200 --> 59:08.700
Yes, it did.

59:08.834 --> 59:10.200
Worked, though.

59:10.333 --> 59:12.033
She always had
your best interests in mind.

59:12.166 --> 59:15.033
Yeah, well, how do you think
I ended up in law school?

59:15.166 --> 59:16.700
What do you mean?

59:16.834 --> 59:17.867
Nothing.

59:18.000 --> 59:19.533
Mom and I just keep
going back and forth

59:19.667 --> 59:22.033
about where her opinion stopped
and mine started,

59:22.166 --> 59:23.767
back when it came
to choosing Yale.

59:23.900 --> 59:25.533
So you're saying
your mom was the one

59:25.667 --> 59:26.867
who drove you
to go to college?

59:27.000 --> 59:29.567
Oh... sure felt like it
at the time.

59:29.700 --> 59:30.734
And I get it--

59:30.867 --> 59:31.900
she lost her husband,

59:32.033 --> 59:34.934
she had to raise me on her own
during tough times...

59:35.066 --> 59:36.233
Right.

59:36.367 --> 59:38.567
Well, then, how could
she not choose an education

59:38.700 --> 59:40.233
over the gamble of showbiz, right?

59:40.367 --> 59:43.033
Mm. She says
she never meant to interfere,

59:43.166 --> 59:44.000
of course...

59:44.133 --> 59:45.367
like I just picked up
on her instinct

59:45.500 --> 59:47.867
and chose the safest path
on my own.

59:49.000 --> 59:50.033
Couldn't that be the case?

59:53.667 --> 59:55.066
Thing is...

59:55.200 --> 59:56.900
no matter
your mother's influence--

59:57.033 --> 1:00:00.000
you had plenty of time
to change your mind, Sara.

1:00:01.000 --> 1:00:03.533
A lot of years
between then and now.

1:00:05.066 --> 1:00:07.033
True.

1:00:07.166 --> 1:00:11.200
Though maybe that's what it was
always about for me, too--

1:00:11.333 --> 1:00:12.767
survival,

1:00:12.900 --> 1:00:15.400
racing one step
ahead of the next calamity.

1:00:15.533 --> 1:00:18.667
Right, but then you're as
secure as a bank safe now.

1:00:18.800 --> 1:00:21.200
So why not go after fulfillment?

1:00:22.233 --> 1:00:24.200
Will you stop?

1:00:24.333 --> 1:00:27.066
You are not very good
at hiding your agenda.

1:00:27.200 --> 1:00:29.200
What?

1:00:29.333 --> 1:00:31.533
Do you think they still do
Christmas Tree Row?

1:00:35.233 --> 1:00:36.667
Let's find out.

1:00:38.834 --> 1:00:40.533
Want another one?

1:00:49.567 --> 1:00:51.433
Remember when we used
to come here late night

1:00:51.567 --> 1:00:52.600
to decorate for orchestra?

1:00:52.734 --> 1:00:53.800
I do.

1:00:53.934 --> 1:00:56.433
One night, we stayed so late
my mom was convinced

1:00:56.567 --> 1:00:58.100
our tree must look like
Rockefeller Center.

1:00:59.400 --> 1:01:01.233
I've missed that laugh.

1:01:01.367 --> 1:01:02.367
Well, what can I say?

1:01:02.500 --> 1:01:04.500
You bring it out.

1:01:04.633 --> 1:01:06.667
I have a confession.

1:01:06.800 --> 1:01:09.000
I have spent years
trying to convince myself

1:01:09.133 --> 1:01:10.667
that I wouldn't change a thing

1:01:10.800 --> 1:01:13.000
about the way things
ended with us.

1:01:13.133 --> 1:01:14.000
That's not so.

1:01:14.133 --> 1:01:14.900
Hmm?

1:01:15.033 --> 1:01:16.934
You're the one thing
I truly regret.

1:01:18.133 --> 1:01:19.967
And?

1:01:21.633 --> 1:01:23.500
That's...
That's your cue.

1:01:25.033 --> 1:01:27.567
Josh, look, these past
couple of weeks with you

1:01:27.700 --> 1:01:29.700
have been...

1:01:29.834 --> 1:01:31.133
wonderful.

1:01:34.834 --> 1:01:36.834
Okay, ahem.

1:01:39.800 --> 1:01:41.934
Let's pretend it's
"Emotions for-Dummies" here.

1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:44.333
Are you saying that--

1:01:44.467 --> 1:01:45.500
just maybe--

1:01:45.633 --> 1:01:47.667
during this whole time,
working on the show,

1:01:47.800 --> 1:01:51.166
that you've had some feelings
for me?

1:01:52.200 --> 1:01:53.834
Okay. "Some".

1:01:53.967 --> 1:01:56.066
Maybe.

1:01:56.200 --> 1:01:58.033
But it's probably
just proximity.

1:01:58.166 --> 1:01:59.867
Mm.

1:02:02.433 --> 1:02:05.633
That must be coming
from the skating rink.

1:02:05.767 --> 1:02:07.734
I love that song.

1:02:08.867 --> 1:02:10.567
I think you love music...

1:02:10.700 --> 1:02:12.166
and the music
we make together.

1:02:14.734 --> 1:02:16.066
Look, Sara.

1:02:16.200 --> 1:02:18.533
I know you're a hugely
successful attorney.

1:02:18.667 --> 1:02:21.567
You have every right
to be proud.

1:02:21.700 --> 1:02:23.667
I'm proud of you.

1:02:25.734 --> 1:02:27.900
But can I ask you something?

1:02:31.200 --> 1:02:32.567
Yes.

1:02:32.700 --> 1:02:35.667
Is your heart racing
as fast as mine is right now?

1:02:40.900 --> 1:02:43.066
Yeah.

1:02:43.200 --> 1:02:47.166
What if we could feel that way
nearly all the time?

1:02:56.000 --> 1:03:00.400
♪ It is the night
of our dear savior's birth ♪

1:03:02.133 --> 1:03:04.300
♪ Long lay the world

1:03:04.433 --> 1:03:07.600
♪ In sin and error pining

1:03:07.734 --> 1:03:09.700
♪ Till He appears

1:03:09.834 --> 1:03:11.133
♪ And the soul felt its--

1:03:11.266 --> 1:03:12.967
Ah! Hi!

1:03:13.100 --> 1:03:15.834
I'm sorry to scare ya.
The door was open.

1:03:15.967 --> 1:03:17.633
- Don't stop.
- Stop what?

1:03:17.767 --> 1:03:19.633
Don't stop singing.

1:03:19.767 --> 1:03:20.967
I was really enjoying that.

1:03:21.100 --> 1:03:23.233
You're just being kind.

1:03:24.133 --> 1:03:26.166
You have a beautiful voice.

1:03:26.300 --> 1:03:27.467
Well, you're gonna hear

1:03:27.600 --> 1:03:30.166
a lot better ones tomorrow night
at the concert.

1:03:30.300 --> 1:03:33.133
Oh...
um, speaking of the concert...

1:03:34.600 --> 1:03:37.166
I've been meaning to ask...

1:03:37.300 --> 1:03:39.233
do you want to go together?

1:03:43.100 --> 1:03:44.467
Uh...

1:03:45.500 --> 1:03:46.834
...uh, well...

1:03:46.967 --> 1:03:50.967
you know, I-I usually go
to that with Imogene.

1:03:52.266 --> 1:03:53.800
Okay.

1:03:53.934 --> 1:03:54.967
Yeah. I understand.

1:03:55.100 --> 1:03:56.300
No problem.

1:03:56.433 --> 1:03:58.633
But you could come w-with us?

1:03:58.767 --> 1:04:01.033
Uh... ah, I don't think so.

1:04:01.166 --> 1:04:04.033
I'll probably see
if Caity wants to go.

1:04:04.166 --> 1:04:05.967
George...

1:04:08.166 --> 1:04:10.300
I really like you.

1:04:11.700 --> 1:04:13.900
I've made some big mistakes
in my life.

1:04:14.033 --> 1:04:16.200
I've made a vow to myself

1:04:16.333 --> 1:04:18.867
to think things through and...

1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:21.200
and take them more slowly.

1:04:22.233 --> 1:04:24.367
Yeah, I made
some mistakes, too.

1:04:24.500 --> 1:04:26.033
But I guess, um...

1:04:26.166 --> 1:04:28.266
I learned
something different.

1:04:29.367 --> 1:04:32.066
You can't stay locked
in the past.

1:04:32.200 --> 1:04:33.767
A real connection--

1:04:33.900 --> 1:04:35.734
that's a rare thing...

1:04:35.867 --> 1:04:39.200
and if you're lucky enough
to find it,

1:04:39.333 --> 1:04:41.633
you grab it while you can.

1:05:00.233 --> 1:05:01.500
- Hello?
- Hi, Josh.

1:05:01.633 --> 1:05:03.734
It's Becca
in Dan Ross's office.

1:05:03.867 --> 1:05:06.100
I have a royalty check
to send you.

1:05:06.233 --> 1:05:08.333
Not much,
but I need your new address.

1:05:08.467 --> 1:05:12.166
Oh, uh, yeah, just send it
to Hickory Real Estate.

1:05:12.300 --> 1:05:13.600
I'll text you the address.

1:05:13.734 --> 1:05:15.000
Great.

1:05:15.133 --> 1:05:16.633
Actually, I'm playing
the Christmas concert

1:05:16.767 --> 1:05:18.300
in Oakcrest tomorrow night.

1:05:18.433 --> 1:05:19.633
Um, we're only a hour away.

1:05:19.767 --> 1:05:22.100
I-If Dan's interested,
let me know,

1:05:22.233 --> 1:05:23.500
and I'll put some tickets
at will-call for him.

1:05:23.633 --> 1:05:24.500
Sounds cool.

1:05:24.633 --> 1:05:26.934
All right. Cool.

1:05:27.066 --> 1:05:28.600
That's our show!

1:05:28.734 --> 1:05:29.967
Merry Christmas, Oakcrest.

1:05:30.100 --> 1:05:31.800
And... curtain.

1:05:35.900 --> 1:05:37.800
You guys will run up on stage
behind us.

1:05:37.934 --> 1:05:39.333
We will all join hands.

1:05:39.467 --> 1:05:40.934
We bow...

1:05:41.066 --> 1:05:44.133
end of spectacular
Christmas Concert.

1:05:44.266 --> 1:05:45.300
Tomorrow night,
we do it for real.

1:05:45.433 --> 1:05:46.433
Get out of here, get to bed.

1:05:46.567 --> 1:05:48.734
Oh, hey, Ellie?
I'll walk you to your mom.

1:05:48.867 --> 1:05:51.100
Okay.

1:05:51.233 --> 1:05:53.233
My lady?

1:06:05.367 --> 1:06:08.667
Sara, I have an idea that--

1:06:08.800 --> 1:06:09.834
is everything okay?

1:06:09.967 --> 1:06:11.066
Look. Don't worry.

1:06:11.200 --> 1:06:13.166
Rough dress rehearsal,
great show.

1:06:14.133 --> 1:06:17.500
My office texted me. Uh...

1:06:17.633 --> 1:06:19.333
The partners were so happy

1:06:19.467 --> 1:06:21.533
with the work that I did
for the appeal...

1:06:21.667 --> 1:06:23.700
my boss and his wife
invited me

1:06:23.834 --> 1:06:28.533
back to New York
for their big New Year's party.

1:06:28.667 --> 1:06:29.834
Okay.

1:06:29.967 --> 1:06:32.400
Well, isn't that cause
for celebration?

1:06:32.533 --> 1:06:34.367
Oh-- sorry for interrupting.

1:06:34.500 --> 1:06:36.367
Josh, is your phone off?

1:06:36.500 --> 1:06:37.533
For rehearsal, yeah.

1:06:37.667 --> 1:06:40.567
Uh, your Nashville agent
called the office

1:06:40.700 --> 1:06:41.867
and he will come to the concert.

1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:43.500
That's pretty neat, huh?

1:06:43.633 --> 1:06:45.834
Uh... I'll leave you to it.

1:06:45.967 --> 1:06:47.066
Thanks.

1:06:47.200 --> 1:06:49.400
You invited your agent?

1:06:49.533 --> 1:06:50.400
Yes.

1:06:50.533 --> 1:06:51.667
Why didn't you tell me?

1:06:51.800 --> 1:06:54.166
Uh, I mean, it just happened
this morning, so.

1:06:54.300 --> 1:06:56.834
Well, I hope he loves you.

1:06:56.967 --> 1:06:58.667
Yeah, yeah. He just might.

1:06:58.800 --> 1:07:01.600
You know, that's all--
that's all thanks to you.

1:07:01.734 --> 1:07:04.734
I mean, you've helped me
find my spark for performing.

1:07:04.867 --> 1:07:06.900
That's great.

1:07:07.033 --> 1:07:07.934
Uh...

1:07:08.066 --> 1:07:11.166
I'm confused here.
Is something wrong?

1:07:14.700 --> 1:07:17.600
Uh, somehow...

1:07:17.734 --> 1:07:19.266
I actually thought for a second

1:07:19.400 --> 1:07:21.900
that you were making this
about us.

1:07:22.033 --> 1:07:24.600
Yeah-- I mean, it is, Sara.

1:07:24.734 --> 1:07:28.767
I'm not the one who needs music
to come back to life again.

1:07:28.900 --> 1:07:30.100
It's you.

1:07:30.233 --> 1:07:31.900
Yeah, you work,
you have success...

1:07:32.033 --> 1:07:33.133
but joy?

1:07:33.266 --> 1:07:36.066
I only see that in you
when we're rehearsing together.

1:07:36.200 --> 1:07:38.600
Look, I care about you, Sara.

1:07:38.734 --> 1:07:40.066
Deeply.

1:07:40.200 --> 1:07:41.967
But what happened to love
in your life

1:07:42.100 --> 1:07:44.066
after we split, hmm?

1:07:44.200 --> 1:07:45.400
That's so melodramatic.

1:07:45.533 --> 1:07:47.133
Melodramatic or not, look,

1:07:47.266 --> 1:07:49.433
I invited my agent

1:07:49.567 --> 1:07:50.567
tomorrow night

1:07:50.700 --> 1:07:51.734
because what happens
at that concert--

1:07:51.867 --> 1:07:53.800
that could lead
to a second chance.

1:07:53.934 --> 1:07:54.800
Okay? For us.

1:07:54.934 --> 1:07:56.934
And when did you
get the impression

1:07:57.066 --> 1:07:58.400
that that was something
that I wanted?

1:07:58.533 --> 1:08:01.467
Or that it was your decision
to make for the both of us?

1:08:01.600 --> 1:08:02.633
I already have a career.

1:08:02.767 --> 1:08:03.633
I know.

1:08:03.767 --> 1:08:05.133
And you're great at it,
from what I hear,

1:08:05.266 --> 1:08:06.633
but how does it make you feel?

1:08:06.767 --> 1:08:08.200
There are people
counting on me,

1:08:08.333 --> 1:08:09.667
and most of those people think

1:08:09.800 --> 1:08:12.734
th-that I am on track
to make partner.

1:08:13.633 --> 1:08:14.800
Is that what you want?

1:08:14.934 --> 1:08:16.934
I'm not throwing away
a decade of my life!

1:08:18.100 --> 1:08:19.967
I am a good lawyer,

1:08:20.100 --> 1:08:21.300
and I just need to get back
to New York--

1:08:21.433 --> 1:08:23.800
...because I know
that I can find happiness there

1:08:23.934 --> 1:08:25.200
if I just work harder at it.

1:08:25.333 --> 1:08:26.834
Listen to yourself!

1:08:26.967 --> 1:08:29.133
You shouldn't have to work
to find happiness!

1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:32.133
Sara, come on.

1:08:34.767 --> 1:08:36.900
I, um, I do have
one favor to ask...

1:08:38.500 --> 1:08:41.100
...that you sing
my mom's song solo.

1:08:41.233 --> 1:08:42.800
W-What?

1:08:42.934 --> 1:08:44.800
I'll accompany you on piano,
or whatever,

1:08:44.934 --> 1:08:47.967
but give your agent to see you,
the new you.

1:08:48.100 --> 1:08:50.000
Come on, this has never
been about my agent, Sara--

1:08:50.133 --> 1:08:51.233
he's already my agent.

1:08:52.467 --> 1:08:53.667
Look.

1:08:53.800 --> 1:08:55.800
I'm done
fighting for you, okay?

1:08:55.934 --> 1:08:56.900
That's it.

1:08:58.100 --> 1:08:59.834
Good. Good.

1:08:59.967 --> 1:09:02.567
Then we are on the same page.

1:09:02.700 --> 1:09:04.266
So you sing and I'll play,

1:09:04.400 --> 1:09:07.100
and my mom will be overjoyed and...

1:09:07.233 --> 1:09:08.533
that works out better anyway,

1:09:08.667 --> 1:09:10.900
because I have a lot left to do
for her move

1:09:11.033 --> 1:09:12.967
before I go back to New York.

1:09:14.166 --> 1:09:15.900
Thanks, Josh.

1:09:16.033 --> 1:09:17.500
For everything.

1:09:40.567 --> 1:09:43.567
What's the matter, honey?
Something happen with Josh?

1:09:45.400 --> 1:09:46.767
Um...

1:09:46.900 --> 1:09:49.934
we have parted ways.

1:09:57.567 --> 1:09:59.767
Is that something you wanted?

1:09:59.900 --> 1:10:01.333
Uh...

1:10:01.467 --> 1:10:02.600
Man.

1:10:02.734 --> 1:10:05.500
I was over him.

1:10:06.900 --> 1:10:09.100
Or so I thought.

1:10:09.233 --> 1:10:11.934
And now, the music,

1:10:12.066 --> 1:10:14.600
and just being
close to him again...

1:10:17.066 --> 1:10:19.667
I'm a mess.

1:10:19.800 --> 1:10:21.300
Oh, honey.

1:10:21.433 --> 1:10:22.867
You know...

1:10:23.900 --> 1:10:26.233
Your first love
never leaves you.

1:10:29.900 --> 1:10:31.100
All those years ago,

1:10:31.233 --> 1:10:34.700
I made the hardest decision
of my life...

1:10:38.266 --> 1:10:40.467
...and here I am...

1:10:40.600 --> 1:10:43.200
the same hurt,
all over again.

1:10:47.633 --> 1:10:49.100
Sara, I never meant

1:10:49.233 --> 1:10:50.767
to interfere
with your decision.

1:10:51.900 --> 1:10:52.967
I'm sorry.

1:10:53.100 --> 1:10:55.600
I let my own fear
get in the way,

1:10:55.734 --> 1:10:59.567
and I'm so sorry I wasn't
a better mother to you.

1:11:00.700 --> 1:11:03.300
A better mother?

1:11:04.333 --> 1:11:05.834
Mom...

1:11:05.967 --> 1:11:08.834
you lost the love of your life,

1:11:08.967 --> 1:11:11.367
and then you sacrificed

1:11:11.500 --> 1:11:13.834
the thing that gave you
the greatest joy,

1:11:13.967 --> 1:11:16.166
all to protect me,

1:11:16.300 --> 1:11:19.266
because you loved me
that much.

1:11:21.133 --> 1:11:26.066
I literally could not have
wished for a better mother.

1:11:27.133 --> 1:11:30.266
And that hard choice
all of those years ago?

1:11:31.300 --> 1:11:33.266
I made it.

1:11:34.300 --> 1:11:36.500
Just me.

1:11:36.633 --> 1:11:37.533
You know, I was thinking about

1:11:37.667 --> 1:11:41.000
something that George said
the other day...

1:11:41.133 --> 1:11:44.934
about how we shouldn't stay
shackled to the past.

1:11:46.834 --> 1:11:48.333
You should listen to him.

1:11:48.467 --> 1:11:50.033
Mm.

1:11:50.166 --> 1:11:51.333
Maybe...

1:11:51.467 --> 1:11:53.567
sometimes...

1:11:53.700 --> 1:11:56.333
people just need to think
with their hearts

1:11:56.467 --> 1:11:58.367
instead of their heads.

1:11:58.500 --> 1:12:00.066
Well, I try.

1:12:00.200 --> 1:12:01.767
I try!

1:12:01.900 --> 1:12:03.967
But I'm getting mixed signals!

1:12:05.200 --> 1:12:07.633
Well, maybe it takes
a leap of faith.

1:12:07.767 --> 1:12:09.400
You know?

1:12:09.533 --> 1:12:11.967
And it's Christmas...

1:12:12.100 --> 1:12:14.867
what better time, right?

1:12:16.033 --> 1:12:18.033
Well...

1:12:19.600 --> 1:12:23.433
I promise you that
I will sleep on that tonight--

1:12:23.567 --> 1:12:26.133
if you will, too.

1:12:26.266 --> 1:12:27.767
I love you...

1:12:27.900 --> 1:12:29.867
I love you.

1:12:44.867 --> 1:12:45.900
Oh!

1:12:46.033 --> 1:12:47.867
- Ahem.
- Sorry.

1:12:48.734 --> 1:12:50.400
You scared me. My bad.

1:12:50.533 --> 1:12:53.400
I, uh,
I didn't get much sleep.

1:12:53.533 --> 1:12:57.633
Listen, Josh, I-I didn't
get a lot of sleep either.

1:12:58.934 --> 1:12:59.900
Yesterday...

1:13:00.100 --> 1:13:01.667
um...

1:13:01.800 --> 1:13:04.800
I felt like I was falling
for you all over again,

1:13:04.934 --> 1:13:09.333
and it put me right back
to where I was when I was 18,

1:13:09.467 --> 1:13:12.300
and it really freaked me out.

1:13:12.433 --> 1:13:14.133
Is that a compliment?

1:13:15.934 --> 1:13:18.967
What if you come with me
to New York?

1:13:19.100 --> 1:13:22.000
For New Year's?

1:13:22.133 --> 1:13:24.633
Uh...

1:13:24.767 --> 1:13:26.066
and then what?

1:13:28.600 --> 1:13:31.867
You follow your lawyer star,
I unpack my guitar,

1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:33.967
and start over in Manhattan
from scratch?

1:13:34.100 --> 1:13:35.467
Uh, I don't know.

1:13:35.600 --> 1:13:37.233
We just figure it out
as we go.

1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:45.700
I've had an amazing
two weeks with you, Sara,

1:13:45.834 --> 1:13:47.200
you know, coming to believe

1:13:47.333 --> 1:13:48.834
that nothing's changed
between us,

1:13:48.967 --> 1:13:51.166
no matter the years, but...

1:13:51.300 --> 1:13:53.667
maybe time
gets the last laugh. huh?

1:13:53.800 --> 1:13:55.166
Hey, Josh?
You're needed for sound check.

1:13:55.300 --> 1:13:56.700
Uh, right.

1:13:56.834 --> 1:13:58.633
Ahem. I gotta...

1:13:58.767 --> 1:13:59.967
Yeah.

1:14:00.166 --> 1:14:02.533
Okay.

1:14:14.033 --> 1:14:15.700
Anna?
George.

1:14:15.834 --> 1:14:18.033
If the invitation's
still open,

1:14:18.166 --> 1:14:19.367
I would love to go

1:14:19.500 --> 1:14:21.500
to the concert
with you tonight.

1:14:23.333 --> 1:14:25.200
I was hoping for a quick yes.

1:14:26.233 --> 1:14:27.233
Yes!

1:14:27.367 --> 1:14:28.867
Okay.

1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:30.533
See you later.

'Merry Christmas to all,
and to all a goodnight!'"

1:15:49.734 --> 1:15:51.767
Besides this show,

1:15:51.900 --> 1:15:54.000
my greatest joy this Christmas

1:15:54.133 --> 1:15:57.734
has been reuniting with
a special person in my life.

1:15:59.100 --> 1:16:00.400
Tonight would not
have happened

1:16:00.533 --> 1:16:03.033
without the help
of Sara Thompson,

1:16:03.166 --> 1:16:06.400
which leads us to our final
number of the evening.

1:16:06.533 --> 1:16:09.500
We have chosen something
very personal to Sara

1:16:09.633 --> 1:16:11.734
and her family.

1:16:11.867 --> 1:16:12.834
Josh...

1:16:12.967 --> 1:16:15.200
is going to be singing--

1:16:15.333 --> 1:16:19.233
...a song written by my dad,
though not performed,

1:16:19.367 --> 1:16:22.700
for this very concert--
nearly three decades ago.

1:16:22.834 --> 1:16:25.533
This one's for you, Mom.
Love you!

1:16:39.967 --> 1:16:41.900
Actually, you know--
hang on a second.

1:16:45.033 --> 1:16:47.500
I-I'm not sure
I've conveyed

1:16:47.633 --> 1:16:50.400
how important Sara's been
to this concert.

1:16:50.533 --> 1:16:52.433
Or to me.

1:16:53.767 --> 1:16:56.000
She deserves more than
just an acknowledgment.

1:16:56.133 --> 1:16:57.767
Much more.

1:16:58.800 --> 1:16:59.700
So...

1:16:59.834 --> 1:17:01.200
ladies and gentlemen,

1:17:01.333 --> 1:17:03.734
I give you the lovely,

1:17:03.867 --> 1:17:05.100
the talented...

1:17:05.233 --> 1:17:07.100
Anna Thompson!

1:17:25.266 --> 1:17:28.367
I haven't done this
in a very long time,

1:17:28.500 --> 1:17:30.934
because I was afraid...

1:17:32.433 --> 1:17:33.734
...of a lot of things.

1:17:34.800 --> 1:17:37.233
But somebody told me that...

1:17:38.266 --> 1:17:39.934
...maybe I should
take a leap of faith.

1:17:41.166 --> 1:17:43.166
So here goes.

1:17:43.300 --> 1:17:45.133
This is a song
by Mike Thompson.

1:17:45.266 --> 1:17:47.166
He wrote it as a gift to me.

1:17:47.300 --> 1:17:49.767
It was his last.

1:18:10.667 --> 1:18:14.033

Come on.
Come on, you guys.

1:20:32.567 --> 1:20:34.500
You were incredible, Ellie.

1:20:34.633 --> 1:20:36.300
That was so much fun!

1:20:36.433 --> 1:20:38.300
Oh, look. Mom and Dad.

1:20:39.266 --> 1:20:40.133
You're looking for my mom?

1:20:40.266 --> 1:20:41.133
- Yeah.
- This way.

1:20:41.266 --> 1:20:42.800
- You were amazing.
- Thanks!

1:20:42.934 --> 1:20:44.000
Mom, look who I found.

1:20:44.133 --> 1:20:45.767
Oh! Hi.

1:20:45.900 --> 1:20:48.467
Well, some date
I turned out to be, huh?

1:20:48.600 --> 1:20:49.767
Oh, so it was a date?

1:20:49.900 --> 1:20:51.300
Wasn't she great?

1:20:51.433 --> 1:20:53.100
I just got the whole story!

1:20:53.233 --> 1:20:55.266
She was up all night,
rehearsing with Josh.

1:20:55.400 --> 1:20:56.767
Well, Josh didn't call
and ask me to sing

1:20:56.900 --> 1:20:58.633
until after Sara
went to bed.

1:20:58.767 --> 1:21:01.734
And then, well, he still
had to do the arrangements

1:21:01.867 --> 1:21:03.433
and print the programs--
he was up all night.

1:21:04.867 --> 1:21:06.066
That must be his agent.

1:21:06.200 --> 1:21:08.066
Oh, no. That's just a friend.

1:21:08.200 --> 1:21:11.200
Josh called off his agent
once he convinced Anna to sing.

1:21:12.467 --> 1:21:13.834
Actually, George, you should
come meet the guy.

1:21:13.967 --> 1:21:16.867
He needs someone to renovate
a new duplex he bought.

1:21:17.000 --> 1:21:18.700
Come on.
Go meet the guy.

1:21:18.834 --> 1:21:20.100
Come on.

1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:24.633
You are very good
at keeping secrets.

1:21:24.767 --> 1:21:26.667
Well, that was Josh's idea.

1:21:26.800 --> 1:21:30.200
He wanted this moment
to be as memorable for you

1:21:30.333 --> 1:21:32.133
as it was for me.

1:21:32.266 --> 1:21:34.667
I didn't think anyone
would get you to sing again.

1:21:34.800 --> 1:21:36.166
Hmm. Neither did I.

1:21:36.300 --> 1:21:37.333
But Josh...

1:21:37.467 --> 1:21:38.467
and George...

1:21:39.667 --> 1:21:40.533
...sometimes,
you're lucky enough

1:21:40.667 --> 1:21:42.834
to find people
who care enough about you

1:21:42.967 --> 1:21:45.667
to show you what you've been
blind to all along.

1:21:45.800 --> 1:21:47.333
Sweetheart.

1:21:47.467 --> 1:21:50.033
I never want you
to stop dreaming.

1:21:50.166 --> 1:21:51.400
Come here.

1:21:53.300 --> 1:21:55.000
What a night!

1:21:59.133 --> 1:22:01.734
Wouldn't that be pretty
in the bay window at the condo?

1:22:01.867 --> 1:22:02.900
Absolutely.
What better way

1:22:03.033 --> 1:22:05.467
to celebrate Christmas
in your new home?

1:22:05.600 --> 1:22:07.533
Our new home!

1:22:08.600 --> 1:22:09.734
Time to make
some new traditions.

1:22:09.867 --> 1:22:12.633
All right. Anything else
you want me to take?

1:22:12.767 --> 1:22:16.066
Well, if there's enough room,
you could take me.

1:22:16.200 --> 1:22:17.200
Oh!

1:22:17.333 --> 1:22:18.734
Just happen to have a space.

1:22:18.867 --> 1:22:20.166
Right next to me.

1:22:21.367 --> 1:22:23.033
- Goodnight, sweetheart.
- Goodnight.

1:22:38.734 --> 1:22:40.734
You were glowing tonight.

1:22:40.867 --> 1:22:42.000
Likewise.

1:22:43.066 --> 1:22:44.734
It almost felt like
old times, huh?

1:22:44.867 --> 1:22:46.400
We're timeless.

1:22:47.734 --> 1:22:48.767
Yeah, well.

1:22:50.533 --> 1:22:53.066
And here I thought
you could manage anything.

1:22:54.200 --> 1:22:56.433
Story of a producer's life, right?

1:22:56.567 --> 1:22:59.066
Make a clean sweep
and start all over.

1:22:59.200 --> 1:23:01.033
Mm.

1:23:01.166 --> 1:23:03.800
Speaking of "start over"...

1:23:04.667 --> 1:23:07.300
I've been thinking about that.

1:23:07.433 --> 1:23:09.333
It has its advantages.

1:23:09.467 --> 1:23:11.300
Yeah.

1:23:11.433 --> 1:23:15.467
And I'm licensed
to practice law in four states,

1:23:15.600 --> 1:23:18.700
so I could pretty much
do that from anywhere.

1:23:18.834 --> 1:23:20.533
But music...

1:23:20.667 --> 1:23:24.200
I can only want do that
in one place...

1:23:24.333 --> 1:23:25.633
with one person.

1:23:26.967 --> 1:23:28.066
Really?

1:23:29.100 --> 1:23:30.033
Just a day ago,

1:23:30.166 --> 1:23:31.867
you were off to a big
law firm gala in New York

1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:33.233
for New Year's.

1:23:34.500 --> 1:23:36.567
My plans changed.

1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:40.533
Don't you ever
want to make partner?

1:23:42.166 --> 1:23:45.066
I already have a partner.

1:23:50.266 --> 1:23:52.433

a ticket to New York.
