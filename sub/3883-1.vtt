Executive producer KIM Woo-taek

00:56.666 --> 00:58.832
We're high school buddies.

00:58.833 --> 01:00.457
Friends they say that last a lifetime.

01:00.458 --> 01:04.207
Some naturally find friendship

01:04.208 --> 01:07.374
but we were forced in to ours.

01:16.083 --> 01:17.874
I didn't take any notes.

01:17.875 --> 01:18.875
Show me yours?

01:22.083 --> 01:23.249
Screw it.

01:23.250 --> 01:24.582
Never mind.

01:48.583 --> 01:50.374
Ehem. Ehemm...

<i>"School backyard"</i>

02:41.916 --> 02:43.457
Did you touch So-min's boobs and run?

02:44.000 --> 02:47.207
I didn't run. I just stood there touching.

02:47.333 --> 02:48.874
What the fuck did you say?

02:49.208 --> 02:50.415
Is that a question?

02:52.541 --> 02:54.374
Did it sound like one, bitch?

02:57.500 --> 02:58.665
Fuck you!

03:01.666 --> 03:02.665
Bastard!

03:02.666 --> 03:03.749
Hey, stop.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.582
Stop it.

03:05.583 --> 03:07.457
Stop fighting.

03:08.416 --> 03:09.707
We're not kids anymore.

03:09.708 --> 03:11.957
You can't do this to your classmate.

03:11.958 --> 03:13.415
Over a girl, no less.

03:13.416 --> 03:15.874
We can resolve this sensibly.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.165
- Rock-paper-scissors?
- That's reasonable.

03:18.166 --> 03:19.624
- Alright!
- Bring it on!

03:21.500 --> 03:23.540
One round settles it.

03:24.041 --> 03:25.540
Rock-paper-scissors!

03:31.333 --> 03:33.207
Rock, if you're a man! Rock-paper-scissors!

03:37.708 --> 03:38.749
Let's do it.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.582
Rock-paper-scissors!

03:41.625 --> 03:47.832
Rock-paper-scissors.

03:47.833 --> 03:49.332
I'll date her first.

03:49.333 --> 03:52.290
I won the toss and I touched her boobs.

03:52.833 --> 03:56.249
It's not gonna last anyway.

03:57.041 --> 03:58.707
You should stick around,

03:58.708 --> 04:01.249
and draw straws when I break up with her.

04:01.500 --> 04:02.707
Okay?

04:03.541 --> 04:05.499
It didn't feel entirely right

04:05.791 --> 04:08.999
but we started hanging out ever since.

04:09.208 --> 04:11.415
Of all the things that happened,

04:11.416 --> 04:14.374
some were trivial like exam scores.

04:14.375 --> 04:16.374
I can't tell who flunked

04:16.375 --> 04:17.790
and who aced the test.

04:17.791 --> 04:21.165
I'm just glad it's over.

04:21.541 --> 04:24.624
And some were big like family issues.

04:28.833 --> 04:31.249
My family's bankrupt, not yours.

04:33.625 --> 04:35.957
Just playing along, man.

04:39.541 --> 04:40.582
Eat up.

04:41.708 --> 04:42.499
Hot!

04:42.500 --> 04:43.915
Damn, it's hot.

04:43.916 --> 04:46.082
I heard you touched Su-jeong's boobs?

04:46.083 --> 04:49.207
Yeah. I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

04:49.791 --> 04:54.290
This may be the end for us

04:54.291 --> 04:56.624
but I'll always wish you the best
as your friend.

04:56.625 --> 04:57.790
Alright?

05:05.666 --> 05:08.082
And some were weird like a bitch slap.

05:08.416 --> 05:10.957
I'm not sure if that's trivial or serious.

05:10.958 --> 05:12.415
I can't hear anything.

05:13.333 --> 05:15.290
Get a life, morons.

05:15.375 --> 05:18.124
I saw a girl become a bitch today.

05:18.583 --> 05:21.374
Then again, I guess they're
all bitches inside.

05:22.875 --> 05:24.874
I'm too old for this.

05:26.500 --> 05:29.707
The phrase 'too old'

05:29.708 --> 05:31.999
felt slightly awkward.

05:32.458 --> 05:34.082
But I guess it made sense

05:34.083 --> 05:36.707
since we were turning twenty.

05:46.125 --> 05:49.582
<i>"Graduation"</i>

06:00.583 --> 06:03.290
We are now forced to choose between

06:03.291 --> 06:05.290
our dreams and reality.

06:05.625 --> 06:08.915
For all the mistakes we
made until this point,

06:08.916 --> 06:13.415
we were given immunity
because we were young.

06:13.875 --> 06:14.999
However,

06:15.000 --> 06:17.790
since we've grown "too old"

06:18.458 --> 06:21.957
we need to make this decision now.

06:22.666 --> 06:28.082
Whichever road you choose remember
to respect and support each other.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.499
- I take this one.
- I'm taking this one.

06:36.416 --> 06:38.415
Can I just point out

06:38.833 --> 06:40.415
that there's another road

06:40.416 --> 06:41.665
just behind us.

06:43.875 --> 06:44.957
I'm off.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.374
Mr. CHA Chi-ho.

06:47.708 --> 06:49.165
You love boobs, don't you?

06:49.166 --> 06:50.499
It's what I live for.

06:50.500 --> 06:53.415
That road will only bring you
your mother's breasts.

06:53.416 --> 06:54.582
Shit!

06:55.875 --> 06:58.040
I'm a man. I'll go straight.

06:58.208 --> 06:59.582
Respect my choice.

07:00.833 --> 07:03.249
Do we have to decide this now?

07:03.500 --> 07:04.415
He has a point.

07:04.416 --> 07:06.165
I don't think we're that old.

07:07.083 --> 07:08.624
Dude, how old do you think you'll be

07:08.625 --> 07:10.624
at the mid point of your life.

07:10.625 --> 07:11.832
Suppose we live till 80...

07:11.833 --> 07:13.673
How do you know if you'll
live till you're 80?

07:14.208 --> 07:17.082
My father passed away at 40. Mozart at 35.

07:17.083 --> 07:19.415
Kurt Cobain died at 27. 27.

07:19.416 --> 07:20.874
But he killed himself.

07:20.875 --> 07:22.707
How do you know that you
won't kill yourself?

07:23.458 --> 07:25.832
What's your point? Get insurance?

07:25.833 --> 07:27.790
You can divide your life into

07:27.791 --> 07:31.165
the first half as a minor
and the second half as an adult.

07:31.500 --> 07:33.499
Hence, the mid point is

07:33.958 --> 07:35.082
twenty.

07:35.208 --> 07:36.665
We're done with the first half?

07:36.666 --> 07:37.749
Damn, we're old.

07:37.750 --> 07:39.749
We're at a crucial point.

07:39.750 --> 07:40.915
We can't just be sitting around.

07:40.916 --> 07:42.207
Exactly.

07:43.041 --> 07:44.540
Let's have sex.

07:44.666 --> 07:45.832
We should have sex.

07:45.833 --> 07:46.749
The three of us?

07:46.750 --> 07:48.874
You, freaking moron!

07:49.583 --> 07:50.957
Mr. CHA, let's not change subjects.

07:50.958 --> 07:53.707
This is a serious issue.

07:54.083 --> 07:56.290
Do you read up on international affairs?

07:56.291 --> 07:58.832
Germany: the average age
of first intercourse is 15.

07:58.833 --> 08:01.540
When Koreans worry about homework,
Germans worry about STDs.

08:01.541 --> 08:04.374
Condoms everywhere. And what's the result?

08:04.375 --> 08:06.499
Mercedes. Audi. First fucking world.

08:06.500 --> 08:07.249
Wow.

08:07.250 --> 08:10.249
How old are you? Twenty
for crying out loud.

08:11.500 --> 08:14.707
Gentlemen, let's not turn into monsters.

08:14.916 --> 08:17.290
I finally understand where the monster

08:18.250 --> 08:19.915
from the movie 'Host' comes from.

08:19.916 --> 08:20.916
Right?

08:21.208 --> 08:23.082
It's a sad movie.

08:23.333 --> 08:25.249
I cried, man.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.999
Let's have sex.

08:28.166 --> 08:29.207
Okay, let's do it.

08:29.625 --> 08:31.374
Let's just do it.

08:31.500 --> 08:34.540
What use is this body anyways.

08:34.750 --> 08:36.207
Let's do it.

08:36.208 --> 08:38.832
If only she wouldn't drink...

08:39.125 --> 08:40.790
But she does.

08:40.791 --> 08:44.582
Shit. Now that I think about it.

08:44.875 --> 08:46.165
Yo, Chi-ho.

08:46.291 --> 08:50.999
You said that you'll sleep with 3,000 women
before you die

08:51.958 --> 08:54.249
and you haven't laid a finger
on your girlfriend.

08:54.458 --> 08:55.582
Are you gay?

08:55.583 --> 08:57.290
Where did she get that pillow?

08:58.916 --> 09:02.165
Now is your chance.

09:04.291 --> 09:05.624
Come here, dummy.

09:06.166 --> 09:07.540
What the heck?

09:09.125 --> 09:11.249
She'll get a cold.

09:11.250 --> 09:13.249
Leave her alone. She'll learn her lesson.

09:13.250 --> 09:14.082
I need a shot.

09:14.083 --> 09:15.290
Honey?

09:18.833 --> 09:20.415
What the hell?

09:20.416 --> 09:22.790
Kids these days... so spoiled.

09:24.875 --> 09:26.582
So spoiled.

09:27.291 --> 09:29.665
What's a college girl doing here?

09:29.666 --> 09:30.874
Huh?

09:30.875 --> 09:32.040
Look, it's Chi-ho.

09:32.041 --> 09:35.332
You should keep an eye out
before she kills herself.

09:35.333 --> 09:38.957
Thanks man! You should
worry about yourself.

09:40.208 --> 09:42.290
Where was I?

09:44.916 --> 09:48.540
I don't want to turn into a monster.

09:50.833 --> 09:52.249
Sir?

09:52.875 --> 09:55.249
I'm against prostitution.

09:55.250 --> 09:59.665
How and where do people get laid?

10:00.041 --> 10:01.749
Don't be afraid.

10:01.958 --> 10:03.415
Impossible is nothing.

10:03.416 --> 10:06.457
You are ready, my son.

10:07.166 --> 10:08.957
It all comes down to...

10:08.958 --> 10:12.624
a simple negotiation, if you will.

10:12.625 --> 10:13.790
For starters,

10:14.833 --> 10:18.082
I'll demonstrate the process.

10:18.750 --> 10:20.082
On a field study.

10:20.083 --> 10:22.374
You are a true friend.

10:26.250 --> 10:28.040
God, I'm nervous.

10:31.125 --> 10:32.332
But where?

10:42.833 --> 10:44.957
I love this music. Who is it?

10:44.958 --> 10:46.082
I don't know.

10:51.833 --> 10:54.582
I'm done drinking. My face is turning red.

10:56.416 --> 10:57.624
Good thinking.

10:58.000 --> 10:59.582
I'll finish yours.

11:03.791 --> 11:05.082
Don't you want her drunk?

11:05.083 --> 11:06.665
Don't push her.

11:06.666 --> 11:09.290
She seems protective of her food.

11:09.291 --> 11:13.290
She'll think you're not interested
in getting her drunk

11:13.291 --> 11:16.790
but rather in her beer.
She's the greedy type.

11:16.791 --> 11:18.374
Never stop analyzing your subject.

11:18.375 --> 11:19.749
You should've studied like that.

11:19.750 --> 11:21.290
Shut it.

11:26.083 --> 11:27.249
So far so good?

11:27.250 --> 11:30.332
I thank my parents for going away so often.

11:31.708 --> 11:33.499
We're drinking alone in my empty house.

11:33.500 --> 11:36.374
This is a done deal
so don't do anything stupid.

11:36.375 --> 11:38.207
Like what?

11:38.625 --> 11:40.165
Say, call the girl's father and...

11:40.291 --> 11:41.374
Mr. Lee?

11:41.375 --> 11:44.832
I was thinking about bonking your daughter.

11:45.000 --> 11:45.999
Yes. Sir.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.999
Your daughter agreed to it

11:48.000 --> 11:49.374
and we're just waiting
for your confirmation.

11:49.375 --> 11:50.124
You won't.

11:50.125 --> 11:51.332
- Right?
- Right.

11:51.333 --> 11:54.207
Game over. Unless...

12:00.416 --> 12:01.415
Funny thing about girls is this.

12:01.416 --> 12:03.874
They'll do anything they want

12:04.083 --> 12:06.540
but won't let their friends do it.

12:06.541 --> 12:08.499
This is a crisis. This could be a problem.

12:08.500 --> 12:11.082
Maintain focus at all cost.

12:11.125 --> 12:14.582
You mustn't panic. Make her panic.

12:14.583 --> 12:17.082
And now the final blow.

12:22.791 --> 12:25.332
I wanna rub my dick all over your ass.

12:26.833 --> 12:28.290
She can't believe her ears.

12:28.291 --> 12:29.749
That would be an understatement.

12:29.750 --> 12:32.540
She's dumbstruck! Astonished!

12:32.541 --> 12:34.415
It triggers "cognitive dissonance."

12:34.416 --> 12:36.374
She's confused.

12:36.375 --> 12:38.124
Now is the time.

12:40.333 --> 12:43.540
Your body's reproductive system
has fully developed

12:43.541 --> 12:45.624
and is ready to go.

12:46.416 --> 12:48.624
Nevertheless, the Department of Education

12:48.625 --> 12:51.790
has worked against nature.

12:52.625 --> 12:56.165
They only emphasize academic achievement

12:56.166 --> 12:59.582
and subdues your mojo

12:59.750 --> 13:02.374
and forces you to become a monk.

13:03.333 --> 13:06.457
The Korean education
system can go fuck itself.

13:06.458 --> 13:09.290
This is real education.

13:09.833 --> 13:11.415
Behold, friends.

13:37.125 --> 13:38.957
Their prayer is

13:39.458 --> 13:42.457
to bless our divine unification.

13:43.125 --> 13:44.374
Want to join in?

14:09.125 --> 14:13.082
This is my definition of sex so far:

14:13.083 --> 14:15.540
"Giving a hand" is essential.

14:15.541 --> 14:18.790
There's no shame in it.

14:18.791 --> 14:21.749
There are only two types of men
who don't masturbate.

14:21.833 --> 14:22.957
Those that have no hands

14:22.958 --> 14:24.457
or no dick.

14:31.791 --> 14:33.790
Hey.

14:37.791 --> 14:42.082
A high school senior has committed suicide
because of test scores.

14:42.083 --> 14:44.874
It's a tragic story that seems
to repeat itself every year.

14:44.875 --> 14:47.540
The irony: He was an honor student.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.499
Mom!

15:06.791 --> 15:08.207
Something's wrong with Gyeong-jae.

15:08.208 --> 15:11.332
He's watching people scream
while slapping his thigh.

15:11.333 --> 15:12.874
I think he's crazy.

15:13.083 --> 15:15.540
Mom's tired. I'll explain everything.

15:18.666 --> 15:19.832
Are you alright?

15:19.833 --> 15:22.624
I'm fine. I'll explain.

15:23.333 --> 15:25.999
It's a ritual that you do
before going to college.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.332
Not religious... although religious people
do it, too.

15:28.333 --> 15:30.415
It's like superstition...

15:30.416 --> 15:31.874
Were you masturbating?

15:48.166 --> 15:53.582
Our twenties were rather embarrassing
than roaring.

16:12.083 --> 16:16.665
What do men do when they're new
to an environment?

16:16.875 --> 16:18.457
They search for women.

16:18.500 --> 16:20.665
It doesn't mean much.

16:20.791 --> 16:23.040
It's just natural.

16:33.666 --> 16:38.457
I did have the tiniest expectation
for campus romance.

16:46.833 --> 16:48.582
- You okay?
- Yes, I'm fine.

16:48.583 --> 16:49.999
I'm worried your shoulder
might be dislocated.

16:50.000 --> 16:50.999
No, I'm fine. Really.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.499
But I feel really bad.

16:52.500 --> 16:53.415
I'm fine.

16:53.416 --> 16:56.457
- Let me buy you a steak dinner.
- I said I'm fine.

16:58.125 --> 17:00.415
A drop in earnings...

17:00.416 --> 17:02.165
This is a good environment for me.

17:02.166 --> 17:04.749
I will devote myself with academic pursuits

17:05.041 --> 17:08.624
and gain sufficient experience

17:08.791 --> 17:11.749
to ready myself for job searching.

17:13.416 --> 17:15.415
Did you hear about the
freshmen orientation?

17:16.250 --> 17:17.874
Yup, yup.

17:18.416 --> 17:19.415
- Hey, In-guk.
- Yea?

17:19.416 --> 17:20.540
What's your family name?

17:20.541 --> 17:22.540
It's HWANG.

17:23.708 --> 17:25.124
What's your name again?

17:27.041 --> 17:28.124
Gyeong-jae.

17:28.916 --> 17:30.082
LEE Gyeong-jae?

17:30.208 --> 17:31.374
KIM Gyeong-jae.

17:33.291 --> 17:34.499
Kimhae clan, right?

17:34.500 --> 17:35.665
No. Andong clan.

17:40.458 --> 17:42.207
Mom!

17:46.958 --> 17:48.832
Bubble wraps! Yay!

17:49.166 --> 17:52.207
Mom, they don't have a playground.

17:52.208 --> 17:53.374
Buy us one, please?

17:53.375 --> 17:55.082
What now?

17:56.416 --> 17:58.624
Dong-woo has a clear goal.

17:58.625 --> 18:00.624
He chose to repeat the year
because of the tuition

18:00.625 --> 18:03.165
but he's saving up hard

18:03.166 --> 18:06.415
and will one day
become Korea's best cartoonist.

18:09.125 --> 18:10.249
Enjoy.

18:10.541 --> 18:11.499
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

18:11.500 --> 18:13.332
We wanted half and half.

18:13.500 --> 18:15.332
Then why did you order plain fried?

18:19.791 --> 18:21.124
Oh, I'm sorry.

18:21.125 --> 18:22.540
Let me get you a new one.

18:32.541 --> 18:33.665
What are you doing?

18:33.750 --> 18:35.207
Sitting still.

18:35.291 --> 18:36.999
For what?

18:38.750 --> 18:39.999
Nothing.

18:42.958 --> 18:46.749
Chi-ho's goal was to keep breathing.

18:47.333 --> 18:48.832
He's accomplished it.

18:50.125 --> 18:52.040
Business!

18:52.041 --> 18:54.040
Management!

18:57.708 --> 18:59.249
Cheers!

19:00.166 --> 19:01.874
Business!

19:07.208 --> 19:09.624
I will accept it
if this is a part of the process

19:09.625 --> 19:13.832
but I was disappointed that
the welcome party for intellectuals

19:13.833 --> 19:16.415
was not at all intellectual.

20:17.333 --> 20:18.790
I thought we've met before

20:18.791 --> 20:20.040
but my intention wasn't to hit on you.

20:20.041 --> 20:21.207
I'm sorry.

20:21.208 --> 20:23.165
- Hi.
- Hello.

20:24.916 --> 20:26.040
Do you know me?

20:26.833 --> 20:28.457
I'm sure a lot of people do.

20:28.958 --> 20:30.707
I'll give you a ride.

20:40.416 --> 20:42.665
I fell completely on my back.

20:42.875 --> 20:44.874
It's the party culture.

20:44.875 --> 20:46.707
No need to feel embarrassed.

20:50.833 --> 20:53.332
Am I driving too fast?

20:53.333 --> 20:54.415
Sorry?

20:59.083 --> 21:01.624
I enjoy the thrill.

21:02.083 --> 21:03.832
I'm actually very comfortable.

21:14.291 --> 21:15.582
Thank you.

21:15.750 --> 21:18.332
You're going that way? See you later.

21:30.250 --> 21:31.832
What's going on?

21:31.833 --> 21:33.665
Why are you getting out of that car?

21:33.666 --> 21:36.207
Did you hear that? She said see you later.

21:36.208 --> 21:37.415
What does she mean?

21:37.583 --> 21:39.290
You idiot.

21:39.291 --> 21:41.749
Don't interpret it beyond words.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.665
She must be rich.

21:43.666 --> 21:46.332
I heard she made a fortune
from the stock market.

21:46.333 --> 21:47.082
Stock market?

21:47.083 --> 21:50.290
She's the top dog in the investment club.

21:51.583 --> 21:53.832
How could you be getting out of her car?

21:55.291 --> 21:58.124
I ran into her at the bus stop and
she recognized me.

21:58.666 --> 22:00.040
- Okay?
- Huh?

22:00.041 --> 22:01.041
Yup.

22:01.708 --> 22:04.499
I didn't recognized her. But she did.

22:04.500 --> 22:05.500
Huh?

22:05.666 --> 22:09.457
That explains it. So,
you haven't seen this yet.

22:09.458 --> 22:11.165
You gotta see this.

22:11.708 --> 22:13.665
You're on Facebook.

22:13.666 --> 22:14.749
- Me?
- Yup.

22:23.541 --> 22:24.749
What the hell?

22:24.750 --> 22:26.832
That was a nasty crack.

22:31.416 --> 22:32.582
Screw this!

22:32.583 --> 22:34.707
I'm not drinking anymore!

22:34.708 --> 22:38.749
This is no welcome party.
This is a suicide pact.

22:39.083 --> 22:41.499
All you want is for us
to drink ourselves to death.

23:16.833 --> 23:20.332
It's the party culture.
No need to feel embarrassed.

23:28.416 --> 23:30.249
You're a Facebook star, man.

23:31.750 --> 23:32.957
In-guk...

23:33.916 --> 23:35.499
This isn't right.

23:38.666 --> 23:40.040
Yo, repeater.

23:40.041 --> 23:42.374
I'm retaking under very sad circumstances.

23:42.833 --> 23:44.040
I'm not cool about that.

23:44.041 --> 23:45.790
I am.

23:49.166 --> 23:50.124
Do you masturbate, too?

23:50.125 --> 23:51.332
Yeah... What?

23:53.000 --> 23:54.040
What the...?

23:54.458 --> 23:56.457
I caught my brother doing it.

23:58.000 --> 24:00.249
How often do you do it?

24:02.333 --> 24:03.499
It was hilarious.

24:04.250 --> 24:06.124
That clumsy idiot...

24:06.125 --> 24:08.249
He was careful. I unlocked his door.

24:08.250 --> 24:10.332
Why would you do that?

24:11.833 --> 24:13.290
Damn you.

24:13.708 --> 24:16.624
I read that lubricant is important
when you masturbate.

24:17.083 --> 24:18.207
You mind?

24:18.958 --> 24:21.207
If you use your bare hand,
the stimulation is too strong

24:21.208 --> 24:22.374
it can leave you desensitized.

24:22.375 --> 24:26.040
A woman cannot provide
the same pressure as your grip.

24:28.625 --> 24:31.582
So, it can create a problem
when you sleep with a woman.

24:32.875 --> 24:34.415
Make sure you use lubrication...

24:34.416 --> 24:35.957
Can you sit somewhere else?

24:40.500 --> 24:42.165
I feel like pasta. Don't you?

24:42.166 --> 24:43.040
Me?

24:43.041 --> 24:44.874
I'm broke, remember.

24:45.208 --> 24:46.499
How depressing!

24:46.500 --> 24:48.374
I feel like taking advantage of a man

24:48.375 --> 24:50.457
but being a student,
I don't have time to meet one.

24:50.458 --> 24:52.082
And I'm a man to you?

24:52.166 --> 24:54.249
Of course, you are. You masturbate.

24:55.208 --> 24:56.999
Gyeong-jae, you idiot!

24:57.000 --> 24:58.707
Buy me a snack then.

24:58.708 --> 25:00.290
Please?

25:00.375 --> 25:01.624
I'll buy.

25:01.625 --> 25:03.040
Hey you!

25:04.375 --> 25:05.832
He's such a loser.

25:06.708 --> 25:07.957
How have you been?

25:10.125 --> 25:12.665
Your college's far away.
What are you doing here?

25:12.875 --> 25:14.207
It's not that far.

25:15.208 --> 25:16.540
I missed you.

25:16.541 --> 25:17.665
You missed me?

25:18.583 --> 25:21.582
I missed you, too.

25:22.791 --> 25:24.665
But since So-hee's a minor,

25:24.666 --> 25:27.082
why don't we go for a beer?

25:27.125 --> 25:30.624
Wow. People change when they go to college.

25:31.916 --> 25:33.082
You know...

25:33.208 --> 25:34.915
I have to get up early for work.

25:34.916 --> 25:36.165
Not because you're broke?

25:36.166 --> 25:36.874
I have money.

25:36.875 --> 25:37.874
- For rice!
- Can you shut up?

25:37.875 --> 25:39.165
I'll buy.

25:40.041 --> 25:41.290
Sorry.

25:42.333 --> 25:43.874
I really can't today.

25:46.666 --> 25:47.790
That's a pity.

25:47.791 --> 25:48.957
I'm free.

25:48.958 --> 25:50.290
It's okay.

25:50.666 --> 25:51.457
How much is it?

25:51.458 --> 25:53.124
I'll get this. I've got money.

25:53.333 --> 25:54.999
Manning up in front of her?

25:55.000 --> 25:57.165
Can you shut up for a second?

26:01.041 --> 26:02.165
You know what?

26:02.666 --> 26:03.874
He jerks off.

26:03.875 --> 26:06.499
Will you stop?

26:06.500 --> 26:07.780
You've been saying that all day.

26:08.166 --> 26:10.290
Wow... Relax.

26:10.875 --> 26:12.582
I'll tease you more tomorrow.

26:16.166 --> 26:19.124
Card bounced.

26:20.916 --> 26:24.665
Mom, did you withdraw cash from my account?

26:24.666 --> 26:26.665
I needed money urgently.

26:27.583 --> 26:30.665
Why didn't you ask me first?

26:30.666 --> 26:33.165
I'm your mother. Besides, you're working.

26:33.166 --> 26:36.124
What about me? What should I do?

26:36.458 --> 26:39.665
- Starve?
- Why did you move out, then?

26:40.208 --> 26:42.457
I can't prepare for exams in a rural town.

26:42.458 --> 26:45.582
They have art classes here, too.

26:45.583 --> 26:46.874
Forget it...

27:16.458 --> 27:18.040
Home sweet home.

27:19.041 --> 27:20.582
Sweet... home...

27:52.875 --> 27:54.874
I heard nasty rumors about you.

27:55.416 --> 27:58.165
I was giving my friends a field lesson.

27:58.166 --> 27:59.790
She told everyone?

28:16.166 --> 28:17.665
Where are you going so early?

28:18.875 --> 28:20.332
I'm going to bed.

28:20.750 --> 28:22.874
I'm a morning person.
I go to bed in the morning.

28:25.041 --> 28:26.665
Come and take a seat.

28:27.458 --> 28:32.999
I don't understand where it all went wrong.

28:35.375 --> 28:39.624
Isn't that something
a failed scientist would say?

28:42.291 --> 28:45.290
Come work at my restaurant.

28:45.291 --> 28:46.999
And go to cooking school.

28:47.291 --> 28:50.207
Why have two chefs under the same roof?

28:50.208 --> 28:52.540
I'm too good-looking to be working
in the kitchen.

28:52.541 --> 28:53.624
So... no.

28:53.916 --> 28:56.582
Cut him off, honey.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.999
That's so violent, dad.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.915
Are you giving me up too?

29:01.916 --> 29:03.249
What about you?

29:03.250 --> 29:05.415
Are you giving up on your life?

29:05.416 --> 29:06.540
All you do is eat, sleep, and shit.

29:06.541 --> 29:08.207
Not quite.

29:08.208 --> 29:09.915
I eat well, I sleep well and I shit well.

29:09.916 --> 29:11.165
It's not so easy.

29:11.500 --> 29:13.165
Plus, I was clubbing all night.

29:13.166 --> 29:15.624
I've been busy. Yea.

29:15.625 --> 29:17.499
Honey? Stop feeding him.

29:17.500 --> 29:19.457
Dad, I'm still growing.

29:19.458 --> 29:22.290
Are you even my father?

29:23.666 --> 29:24.790
Alright.

29:25.625 --> 29:27.457
Fine. I hear you.

29:27.458 --> 29:30.207
I will, before the end of this year...

29:30.333 --> 29:31.999
Not even next year.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.165
I'm not that kind of person.

29:33.166 --> 29:35.707
This year!

29:35.708 --> 29:39.707
I'm gonna think seriously about what I want
to do with myself.

29:39.708 --> 29:41.582
So let's continue with my allowance.

29:41.583 --> 29:43.249
Deal?

29:44.166 --> 29:46.207
- No.
- Oh, come on.

29:46.208 --> 29:47.624
I think it's a waste.

29:49.458 --> 29:51.165
Then give me my college tuition.

29:51.166 --> 29:53.040
Where's your admission letter?

29:53.583 --> 29:55.124
- Tuition first.
- Piss off.

29:55.125 --> 29:56.707
Come on!

29:56.708 --> 29:57.749
I need money!

29:57.750 --> 29:59.457
I never asked to be born.

29:59.458 --> 30:01.499
I'm a by-product of your pleasure!

30:01.666 --> 30:02.790
You little shit...!

30:02.791 --> 30:04.790
I need money!

30:04.791 --> 30:06.540
I want my money.

30:06.666 --> 30:09.332
How am I suppose to live without any money?

30:11.666 --> 30:12.707
Get your act together.

30:12.708 --> 30:13.999
Give me my money.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.165
Please?

30:15.166 --> 30:16.499
- Father.
- Okay.

30:16.500 --> 30:18.165
Please.

30:18.333 --> 30:20.624
I need my allowance!

30:20.625 --> 30:24.457
Please, dad. Please?

30:24.458 --> 30:26.290
<i>"DOWN WITH DISCRIMINARY REDEVELOPMENT"</i>

30:26.291 --> 30:28.040
<i>"TOGETHER, WE FIGHT TO DEATH"</i>

30:28.041 --> 30:29.999
<i>"SOH SOH CHINESE RESTAURANT"</i>

30:32.958 --> 30:35.040
I love it when you eat well.

30:35.791 --> 30:36.790
Let's break up.

30:36.791 --> 30:38.707
What now?

30:38.875 --> 30:40.415
I have no income.

30:40.666 --> 30:42.374
I can't meet a poor girl like you.

30:42.958 --> 30:46.165
All I can give you now
is this pickled radish

30:46.250 --> 30:47.665
but I have a bright future.

30:47.666 --> 30:48.874
Right?

30:48.875 --> 30:50.874
It's too uncertain.

30:51.291 --> 30:53.749
I'm gonna find me a sugar mama at a bar.

30:53.750 --> 30:56.707
Chi-ho, you'll never veer off course.

30:56.708 --> 30:58.332
Why do you say that?

30:59.041 --> 31:01.290
Because your parents are upright people.

31:01.625 --> 31:03.457
You'll never go wrong.

31:03.458 --> 31:05.165
How come you're so straight?

31:05.166 --> 31:06.499
Well I'm in love with you...

31:06.833 --> 31:08.124
I'm worried for you.

31:08.458 --> 31:10.707
Stop being so serious

31:10.708 --> 31:11.749
and eat up.

31:12.750 --> 31:14.040
I'm going to school.

31:14.666 --> 31:15.665
Want a kiss?

31:15.666 --> 31:17.207
No.

31:17.500 --> 31:18.582
Hey.

31:20.583 --> 31:21.915
What should I do?

31:22.791 --> 31:24.582
Are you being serious?

31:25.833 --> 31:27.415
I can't decide

31:27.416 --> 31:30.415
between League of Legends
or World of Warcraft.

31:31.083 --> 31:33.124
A matter of life and death.

31:34.583 --> 31:36.040
Try selling your game items.

31:36.041 --> 31:38.040
That'll get you by for a couple of months.

31:42.500 --> 31:47.124
The increase in actual
income affects demand

31:47.666 --> 31:50.624
Look at the graph shows...

31:50.625 --> 31:53.332
They say love sweeps you off your feet.

31:53.541 --> 31:55.707
Swept me, alright.

32:06.083 --> 32:07.665
Hi, Gyeong-jae!

32:08.041 --> 32:09.374
Hello!

32:10.833 --> 32:12.832
She called my name.

32:15.208 --> 32:16.499
Jin-ju...

32:20.958 --> 32:23.707
I'd like to join the investment club.

32:23.875 --> 32:26.249
This club is seriously boring.

32:26.250 --> 32:29.165
It takes a lot of time and effort.

32:29.250 --> 32:31.332
Investment must be made rationally.

32:31.333 --> 32:33.874
Do not invest unless you understand it.

32:33.875 --> 32:35.999
Exactly.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.249
Rational judgment...

32:41.708 --> 32:42.790
Hey!

32:43.875 --> 32:45.207
Good morning, professor!

32:47.708 --> 32:49.124
Do you know him?

32:49.416 --> 32:50.457
Sorry?

32:51.041 --> 32:53.790
I recognized him from TV.

32:54.791 --> 32:56.082
How do you know him?

32:56.333 --> 32:57.957
I go to his lecture.

32:59.041 --> 33:01.124
I wanted to sign up for it, too.

33:01.125 --> 33:03.415
Don't bother. He's full of shit

33:03.416 --> 33:04.957
and immoral.

33:07.083 --> 33:09.249
You talk shit too?

33:11.041 --> 33:12.207
Gyeong-jae.

33:12.750 --> 33:14.582
I'm going for a drive.

33:14.875 --> 33:17.874
I don't want to go alone.
Mind investing your time?

33:19.083 --> 33:20.332
Only if you can understand.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.040
Sure.

33:22.500 --> 33:24.332
I think I can understand.

33:39.708 --> 33:42.749
I wasn't planning on joining a club.

33:42.875 --> 33:43.624
Why not?

33:43.625 --> 33:49.290
I was afraid that it might
give me wrong goals.

33:49.291 --> 33:52.040
Like becoming an artist.

33:52.041 --> 33:54.832
So you prevent things before they happen?

33:56.375 --> 33:57.957
- You're scary.
- Sorry?

33:57.958 --> 34:00.832
Also, I love the ties.

34:01.583 --> 34:04.332
I'll buy you ties when you get a job.

34:04.500 --> 34:06.207
Promise!

34:06.208 --> 34:10.415
We should seal the deal with a shot...
but who's gonna drive?

34:10.583 --> 34:11.624
You can.

34:12.916 --> 34:16.665
I do have my license. But
I've never really...

34:16.666 --> 34:18.207
Then, we'll stay the night.

34:28.791 --> 34:30.207
I'll give it a go.

34:31.625 --> 34:32.957
You should sleep at home.

34:33.750 --> 34:36.124
You must have a reason to go home too.

34:36.958 --> 34:40.582
My boyfriend always goes home early.

34:41.958 --> 34:44.374
Is he a gamer?

34:45.291 --> 34:46.707
Maybe.

34:47.416 --> 34:50.957
Anyways, it's nice he's not here.

34:52.250 --> 34:55.249
- You gotta suck 'em like a man.
- But...

34:57.458 --> 34:59.040
Can't they keep it down?

35:01.083 --> 35:02.874
I know, right?

35:04.083 --> 35:05.915
Do what you did at the party.

35:06.333 --> 35:10.832
Oppose the rotten system like a rebel.

35:10.833 --> 35:13.082
I'll suck 'em for lunch, for dinner...

35:14.458 --> 35:15.582
and in bed till I fucking pass out.

35:15.583 --> 35:18.915
That wasn't really me that night...

35:19.041 --> 35:20.915
You were drunk but it was still you.

35:21.083 --> 35:22.999
I don't think this is...

35:23.666 --> 35:25.207
I will, then.

35:26.291 --> 35:29.790
The duty of youth is to
challenge corruption.

35:29.791 --> 35:31.957
You like Kurt Cobain?

35:32.208 --> 35:33.832
Shut your fucking mouth!!!
