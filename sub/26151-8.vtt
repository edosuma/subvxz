in a totally non-obsessive,
casual sort of way.

42:37.986 --> 42:40.019
Call me, please.

42:41.456 --> 42:43.522
Karen, hi.

42:44.792 --> 42:46.726
Do you work around here?

42:46.761 --> 42:50.096
- No, just walking
around the block.

42:51.666 --> 42:53.032
I won't keep you.

42:53.067 --> 42:56.302
I just had to say thank you.

42:56.337 --> 42:59.372
I owe you.
- For what?

42:59.407 --> 43:03.275
- Turns out, you're my
"get out of Joe free" card.

43:03.311 --> 43:05.444
You...

43:05.480 --> 43:07.880
you showed me
who he really is.

43:07.915 --> 43:11.117
- And that is?
- Besides a liar and a cheater?

43:11.152 --> 43:13.285
- I really have to go.

43:13.321 --> 43:14.987
- Of course.

43:15.023 --> 43:17.623
Just be careful.

43:17.658 --> 43:20.893
I got a feeling
you're no Candace.

43:20.928 --> 43:23.162
- Okay, what the hell is that
supposed to mean?

43:23.197 --> 43:24.463
- Hey, look,

43:24.499 --> 43:26.966
I couldn't fill in
the ex shoes either.

43:27.001 --> 43:28.134
Whoever this girl is,

43:28.169 --> 43:30.336
she's still got her claws
in him.

43:34.575 --> 43:35.975
- Well, this has been fun.

43:36.010 --> 43:37.977
You got to play
the spiteful ex.

43:38.012 --> 43:40.212
Now let's just say good-bye.

43:40.248 --> 43:42.815
- Yeah, I'm sure you two
will be fine.

43:42.850 --> 43:44.884
Of course, you got to know

43:44.919 --> 43:46.352
what he did to me,
one of these days,

43:46.387 --> 43:48.821
he's gonna do to you,

43:48.856 --> 43:49.922
or worse.

43:49.957 --> 43:51.524
Maybe he'll do

43:51.559 --> 43:53.259
whatever the hell he did
to Candace.

43:55.263 --> 43:57.496
Enjoy it while it lasts, Beck.
