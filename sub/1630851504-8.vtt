- Zero to 60 in a week

if you're going downhill.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.663

02:51.078 --> 02:52.412
- Amen. I agree.
- Right?

02:52.505 --> 02:55.248
So I want to redo
the whole guts to make it fly.

02:55.333 --> 02:58.510
But then I want to keep it
kind of like this.

the Indy pace car.

03:02.265 --> 03:03.506
- Right.
- Yeah.

03:03.591 --> 03:05.008
- But you want her
to run like she looks.

03:05.092 --> 03:07.010
- Absolutely.
- Aha.

03:07.103 --> 03:10.189
I'm going to recommend,
like, an LS3.

03:10.348 --> 03:15.101
Let's do, like, a 4L65E
automatic overdrive trans

03:15.186 --> 03:19.281
pushing 475-plus,
475 to 500 horse.

03:19.440 --> 03:21.024
- Yeah.
- Now we're talking.

03:21.117 --> 03:22.701
- I don't how crazy
you want to get,

03:22.860 --> 03:27.956
but we can do some really
cool suspension upgrades.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.792
Hotchkis makes some fantastic
suspension upgrades.

03:30.877 --> 03:31.960
- That's what I want.
- Okay.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.378
- I'm a big fan of it.

03:33.463 --> 03:35.464
The car,
the car will sit perfect,

03:35.623 --> 03:37.049
it'll handle better,

03:37.133 --> 03:38.541
everything that
we've talked about

03:38.635 --> 03:41.470
so far kind of puts the car
on a diet as well.

03:41.629 --> 03:42.888
So the power-to-weight ratio

03:42.972 --> 03:44.881
is always where it's at
with the car.

03:44.966 --> 03:46.049
- Yeah, [indistinct].
- So it's phenomenal.

03:46.142 --> 03:47.726
So this car is gonna be a blast.

03:47.885 --> 03:49.386
- Nice.

03:49.470 --> 03:51.730
- How about some nice sound?
How about some exhaust?

03:51.814 --> 03:55.317
- Oh, make it rumble?
Come on, come on. You're on.

03:55.401 --> 03:57.736
- The suspension,
the exhaust, yeah.

03:57.820 --> 03:59.655
- You're on. You know what?
- That's my girl, man.

03:59.814 --> 04:01.240
- I'll tell you
what really sounds--

04:01.399 --> 04:05.485
Honestly what really sounds
great with the LS3 setup is,

04:05.578 --> 04:08.247
I'm a big fan
of the Borla exhaust system.

04:08.331 --> 04:09.572
- Yeah.
- They just sound great.

04:09.666 --> 04:10.916
- I think the Borla
would be good,

04:11.075 --> 04:12.742
and we can still
bring it out the back, right?

04:12.827 --> 04:15.328
- Absolutely.
We'll keep it looking

04:15.413 --> 04:17.756
very, very much
like it's supposed to look.

04:17.915 --> 04:19.841
- It's like having a rooster
in the neighborhood.

04:19.926 --> 04:22.419
- Nice. Nice.
Wake them up in the morning.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.087
- Right. It's supposed
to be a Corvette.

04:24.171 --> 04:25.505
Now we're going to repaint
the whole car?

04:25.589 --> 04:27.340
- Yeah.
- Cool.

04:27.425 --> 04:29.509
And we're gonna do it as it is?
- Count's Kustoms'--yeah.

04:29.593 --> 04:31.344
- But just better.
- But Count's Kustoms' wa.

04:31.429 --> 04:34.273
- Good. Because I love
this paint scheme.

04:34.357 --> 04:37.684
We can do the black, but
a mucho grande better black.

04:37.768 --> 04:40.770
- Yeah.
- We can do the silver,

04:40.863 --> 04:43.532
and again,
a much grande better silver.

04:43.691 --> 04:45.784
Leon, tell me about the
interior of this thing, man.

04:45.943 --> 04:48.870
- Well, man, you know,
the interior on this,

04:48.955 --> 04:50.706
it looks like
it's okay right now,

04:50.865 --> 04:52.124
but it ain't right.
- Okay.

04:52.208 --> 04:54.960
- That's vinyl, and it's not
supposed to be vinyl.

04:55.119 --> 04:56.211
- Right.
- It's supposed to be leather.

04:56.370 --> 04:57.370
- Oh, it's--yeah, it's been
redone.

04:57.463 --> 04:58.714
It's all been redone.

04:58.873 --> 05:00.123
- And I think somebody
spray-painted

05:00.216 --> 05:02.042
the dash and the other stuff.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.052
- Yeah, that's not right.
All right, so we're gonna redo

05:04.211 --> 05:06.305
the interior
or at least most of it.

05:06.464 --> 05:09.391
- We kind of like your Count's
Kustoms touch on the inside.

05:09.475 --> 05:12.561
- Okay. So there's a little
open-mindedness on this?

05:12.720 --> 05:14.146
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay.

05:14.230 --> 05:16.481
- I want when you approach
this car from a distance,

05:16.640 --> 05:18.308
it's like, "Oh, I know exactly
what that is."

05:18.401 --> 05:20.226
- Right.
- But when you get closer,

05:20.311 --> 05:22.237
you look at that paint and go,
"That's not original," righ?

05:22.322 --> 05:24.323
- Love it. Love it.
- "That's not original."

05:24.482 --> 05:26.825
And you look inside,
and it's, like, wow.

05:26.984 --> 05:28.234
- Why is this one
so much cooler than that on?

05:28.319 --> 05:29.486
- Right.
- Exactly.

05:29.570 --> 05:31.071
- Yeah.
- Gotcha. The nice thing is,

05:31.164 --> 05:32.998
is, it looks like you
brought us a really nice car.

05:33.157 --> 05:37.085
- Oh, and that eight-track
tape player's got to go.

05:37.170 --> 05:41.673
- Okay, we'll upgrade that.
While I got you here on that,

05:41.832 --> 05:45.761
is it okay if we literally
just change that whole panel?

05:45.845 --> 05:47.587
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, because, you know,

05:47.671 --> 05:50.256
you can do those radios

05:50.341 --> 05:52.592
that have the knobs
in the factory spot,

05:52.685 --> 05:53.676
but they're kind of
a little bit of a pain

05:53.770 --> 05:55.437
in the butt to deal with.
- Yeah.

05:55.596 --> 05:57.356
- But if it's okay if we just
change that whole panel,

05:57.440 --> 05:58.607
we can put in something
modern in there.

05:58.691 --> 06:00.016
- Yeah, do your thing.

06:00.101 --> 06:00.776
- Same with the gauges?
Digital gauges?

06:00.935 --> 06:02.102
- Yeah.
- Oh, cool.

06:02.186 --> 06:03.195
Oh, I can upgrade
all the gauges?

06:03.279 --> 06:04.363
- Upgrade the gauges.
Absolutely.

06:04.447 --> 06:05.688
- Love it.

06:05.773 --> 06:07.440
So at this point, man,
you know what?

06:07.525 --> 06:11.611
We're talking an all-new wiring
harness as well to go along

06:11.695 --> 06:13.780
with the drivetrain,
to go along with the gauges,

06:13.864 --> 06:15.957
we'll fix
all your window problems,

06:16.042 --> 06:17.542
we'll do the interior.

06:17.701 --> 06:20.045
Dude, I'm all over this.
When can you leave it?

06:20.129 --> 06:21.630
- It's yours.

06:21.714 --> 06:24.383
- Kev, the ball is
on your court now, bro.

06:24.542 --> 06:26.968
And I'm just gonna
get to know this car.

06:27.128 --> 06:28.637
- All right, cool.
- Sweet.

06:28.796 --> 06:30.472
Pleasure, brother.
Indeed a pleasure.

06:30.556 --> 06:31.881
Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

06:31.966 --> 06:33.216
- You know, a lot of times,
we get a car

06:33.300 --> 06:35.635

as fast on the outside

06:35.719 --> 06:37.303

it's kind of the opposite, man.

06:39.723 --> 06:41.975
I love these pace cars,
and Leon and Lynn, man,

06:42.059 --> 06:43.485
they feel the same way.

06:43.569 --> 06:46.396
So we need to fix up
that weak-ass drivetrain

06:46.480 --> 06:50.325
and that sad interior to match
the wicked-cool outside.

06:50.484 --> 06:53.153

24:40.812 --> 24:42.971
- We cannot guarantee the

24:44.891 --> 24:46.308

24:46.392 --> 24:47.902

we'd commit to it.

a brand-new gas tank

24:50.730 --> 24:53.157

that goes with bike...

24:53.316 --> 24:56.327
so the frame done,
brand-new gas tank in,

24:56.486 --> 24:58.570

24:58.655 --> 25:01.332

all the cobweb flames, dude.

25:01.416 --> 25:03.075
That's one thing
I've never done before.

25:03.168 --> 25:05.577

Or, like, you-can-see-them
cobwebs?

25:07.422 --> 25:09.089

I'm not so sure yet.

25:09.174 --> 25:10.591
I'm not sure yet.

25:10.675 --> 25:12.251
I think I want to do
the cobwebs in black.

25:12.335 --> 25:13.585
- Yeah?

25:13.670 --> 25:16.347
- And cobweb everything
but the flames.

25:16.431 --> 25:19.591
The darker color
is actually just cobwebs.

25:19.684 --> 25:21.352

25:21.511 --> 25:23.595

25:23.680 --> 25:24.846
- Gotcha.

25:24.940 --> 25:26.357
- Oh, maybe I want to go
check that out,

25:26.516 --> 25:28.016

and you're like,

25:28.101 --> 25:29.360
"Wait a minute,
these aren't ghost flames.

25:29.444 --> 25:30.861
That's straight up
cobwebs everywhere."

25:30.946 --> 25:34.198
- For some reason,
this thing is, like, bling.

25:34.282 --> 25:36.033
- Oh, yeah.
- Massive.

25:36.192 --> 25:37.201
- Pow.

25:37.360 --> 25:38.953

of the day?

25:39.112 --> 25:40.621
- Tomorrow, absolutely.

25:40.705 --> 25:41.872
- I'll buy you lunch.

25:42.031 --> 25:43.615

25:43.700 --> 25:45.534

It's lunch.

25:45.618 --> 25:47.119

- Well, I heard you had
a little spill with it.

29:11.082 --> 29:12.741
- Why'd you ask me
about that, dude?

29:12.825 --> 29:14.752
- Yeah, man. What happened?

29:14.836 --> 29:18.747
- I T-boned a car, dude.
- Yeah.

32:49.467 --> 32:50.717
out of the chip book,
and you said,

32:50.802 --> 32:52.636
"I want black cherry,

32:52.720 --> 32:55.463

to go easy on the black."

32:55.548 --> 32:57.975
You wanted a little more red
than the black side.

32:58.059 --> 32:59.968
And then you wanted
pinstripe flames

33:00.052 --> 33:02.887
and then cobwebs
all around the flames.

33:02.972 --> 33:05.140
- The skull, man.
- That, actually,

33:05.224 --> 33:06.558
- It's awesome.

33:06.651 --> 33:07.985
I got that from the artwork
that you sent me.

33:08.144 --> 33:09.903

- Amen.

while you collect the bills.

41:26.141 --> 41:28.643
- Man, look at that thing.
It's just too cool for school.

41:28.727 --> 41:31.229
- It's beautiful.
- It's gorgeous, brother.

41:31.322 --> 41:33.564
- I'm so pumped that Leon
and Lynn loved their Corvette.

41:33.649 --> 41:35.650
This car looks amazing.

41:35.734 --> 41:37.327
And now it has all the power

41:37.486 --> 41:40.488
<i>under the hood that it
should have had back in 1978.</i>

41:40.581 --> 41:41.831
Leon and Lynn,
they are gonna have

41:41.916 --> 41:44.408
a blast cruising the streets
and meeting people

41:44.502 --> 41:46.920
<i>who want to know all
about their gorgeous machine.</i>

41:47.004 --> 41:49.330
I'm psyched
that they finally got

41:49.423 --> 41:50.590
the Corvette of their dreams.

41:50.674 --> 41:57.472
