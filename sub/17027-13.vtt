WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:04.705
KARA: When I was a child,
my planet Krypton was dying.

00:04.738 --> 00:08.376
I was sent to Earth
to protect my cousin.

00:08.409 --> 00:10.244
But my pod got
knocked off-course

00:10.278 --> 00:11.712
and by the time I got here,

00:11.745 --> 00:16.050
my cousin
had already grown up
and become Superman.

00:16.717 --> 00:18.386
I hid who I really was

00:18.419 --> 00:22.656
until one day
when an accident forced me
to reveal myself to the world.

00:22.690 --> 00:25.793
To most people, I'm a reporter
at CatCo Worldwide Media.

00:25.826 --> 00:29.530
But in secret, I work with my
adoptive sister for the DEO

00:29.563 --> 00:31.465
to protect my city
from alien life

00:31.499 --> 00:34.502
and anyone else
that means to cause it harm.

00:35.603 --> 00:38.839
I am Supergirl.

00:38.872 --> 00:40.641
KARA:
Previously on Supergirl...

00:40.674 --> 00:41.809
I'm going back to Mars.

00:41.842 --> 00:43.144
Goodbye, J'onn.

00:43.177 --> 00:45.146
Goodbye, Miss Martian.

00:45.179 --> 00:47.148
And I just got me thinking...

00:47.181 --> 00:49.417
Maybe I can have it all.

00:49.450 --> 00:50.618
Darling!

00:50.651 --> 00:52.486
Kara Zor-El, I love you.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.390
First, let's set the mood!

00:56.857 --> 00:58.459
Candles!

00:58.492 --> 00:59.527
Who are you?

00:59.560 --> 01:00.661
Then, music!

01:00.694 --> 01:01.729
(PLAYING CLASSICAL MUSIC)

01:01.762 --> 01:04.064
-What the hell?
-Next, flowers!

01:05.566 --> 01:07.635
And for the
piece de resistance...

01:07.668 --> 01:09.170
The ring!

01:09.203 --> 01:10.338
Kara, sweetie,
it's like I said.

01:10.371 --> 01:11.872
I'm your one true love,
your soulmate,

01:11.905 --> 01:13.574
your one true pairing
as the kids say.

01:13.607 --> 01:17.178
My name is Mxyzptlk
and I love you, Kara Zor-El.

01:17.211 --> 01:19.547
Uh... Uh...

01:19.580 --> 01:20.714
Tell me...

01:20.748 --> 01:22.383
Will you marry me?

01:22.416 --> 01:23.884
-(LAUGHS)
-* I can show you
the world *

01:23.917 --> 01:27.521
Hey.
I don't know how you got
to this planet,

01:27.555 --> 01:30.591
-but she's with me.
-The other suitor!

01:30.624 --> 01:33.594
I didn't see you there, tall,
dark and bland-some.

01:33.627 --> 01:36.330
You're barely there,
let alone my romantic rival.

01:36.364 --> 01:37.531
-No!
-(GRUNTS)

01:38.166 --> 01:39.200
What...

01:39.233 --> 01:40.468
Invisible is a good look
on you.

01:40.501 --> 01:42.570
Let's play to your strengths.

01:48.776 --> 01:50.178
Mon-El?

01:50.211 --> 01:51.779
Hey. Hey.

01:51.812 --> 01:53.314
I'm going to kill him.

01:53.347 --> 01:54.815
What did you do with him?

01:54.848 --> 01:58.619
Relax, he's just letting it
all hang out in the DEO.

01:58.652 --> 02:02.290
This is how it should be.
Just you and me, together.

02:02.323 --> 02:04.425
Without McGurk-El around.

02:04.458 --> 02:07.628
-* Shining, shimmering
-Stop! Stop.

02:07.661 --> 02:10.898
I don't know who you are
or how you got here, Mix...

02:10.931 --> 02:12.466
Mxyzptlk.

02:12.500 --> 02:14.602
It's spelled like it sounds.

02:17.805 --> 02:21.209
All right then, Mxyzptlk,

02:21.242 --> 02:24.178
just start again,
and start slow.

02:24.212 --> 02:25.679
Where are you from?

02:25.713 --> 02:27.715
They call me the
inter-dimensional man
about town,

02:27.748 --> 02:30.451
but it doesn't matter where
I'm from, sweet cheeks.

02:30.484 --> 02:33.387
-So let's get this knot tied.
-(GASPS) What?

02:33.421 --> 02:35.656
It's... Are you crazy?

02:35.689 --> 02:38.526
-You can't just put me
in a wedding dress.
-Why not?

02:38.559 --> 02:39.593
It's Vera Wang.

02:39.627 --> 02:42.530
This is not okay.

02:42.563 --> 02:45.399
Okay.
I'm sorry, I came on strong.

02:45.433 --> 02:48.936
I'm just enthusiastic
to finally be here
with you.

02:48.969 --> 02:50.538
How do you even know who I am?

02:51.939 --> 02:53.307
(PLAYING VIOLIN)

02:53.341 --> 02:55.843
I watched you cross
the dimensions.

02:55.876 --> 02:59.380
An eternity of lovelessness.

02:59.413 --> 03:01.549
There's no one like you
where I'm from, Kara.

03:01.582 --> 03:04.485
No woman as strong,
or independent,
or as beautiful,

03:04.518 --> 03:07.321
or as brave, or as bold...

03:07.355 --> 03:11.792
Okay. Look. I'm flattered.

03:11.825 --> 03:14.795
But I'm not going
to marry you,
Mxyzptlk.

03:16.830 --> 03:19.667
It's funny,
I'm all seeing
and all powerful,

03:19.700 --> 03:22.303
but that's one
of the few things
I can't make you do.

03:22.336 --> 03:24.838
That and make you fall
in love with me
and/or stop you

03:24.872 --> 03:27.575
from killing yourself and/or
make you drink orange
juice for some reason.

03:27.608 --> 03:29.610
Everything else, yes.
But go figure.

03:29.643 --> 03:33.914
Well, I'm sorry
to disappoint you,
but I'm just not interested.

03:33.947 --> 03:37.385
Don't be sorry, buttercup,
I know what you're doing.

03:37.418 --> 03:40.788
You're playing hard to get,
which is utterly charming
and delightful, by the way.

03:40.821 --> 03:42.856
What? No. No. I'm not...

03:42.890 --> 03:46.226
You're flustered, confused,
your heart is racing?

03:47.295 --> 03:48.829
I have that effect on women.

03:48.862 --> 03:50.331
Let me tell you
how this works.

03:50.364 --> 03:51.699
I chose you as my mate,

03:51.732 --> 03:53.601
and now I will wow you with
breathtaking feats

03:53.634 --> 03:55.869
of ardor until you fall madly
in love with me.

03:55.903 --> 04:00.341
And fear not, Kara Zor-El,
you will fall in love with me.

04:00.374 --> 04:05.379
Once you've been adored
by all powerful Mxy,
there's no going back, see?

04:07.014 --> 04:08.716
Ciao, mio amore.

04:17.925 --> 04:20.428
You've just been visited
by a Fifth Dimensional being.

04:20.461 --> 04:22.330
Wait, you've seen one
of these things before?

04:22.363 --> 04:23.431
Not here on Earth.

04:23.464 --> 04:25.466
On Mars,
one of them moved

04:25.499 --> 04:29.637
the Xan'Xie Mountains
halfway across the planet
during the Zook Uprising.

04:29.670 --> 04:31.772
Fifth Dimensional life forms
possess the ability to warp

04:31.805 --> 04:33.941
our reality to their
own whims.

04:33.974 --> 04:36.944
Abilities that would appear,
to all intents and purposes,
to be magic.

04:36.977 --> 04:40.614
On Daxam we had
a zero tolerance policy
for those creatures.

04:40.648 --> 04:42.550
-You had them on Daxam?
-Yeah.

04:42.583 --> 04:43.784
And those guys knew
how to party,

04:43.817 --> 04:45.886
but they're dangerous.
Very dangerous.

04:45.919 --> 04:48.021
Agent Schott,
scan the archives for anything

04:48.055 --> 04:50.958
resembling Fifth Dimensional
incursions here on Earth.

04:50.991 --> 04:53.727
Close Encounters
of the Fifth Kind.
You got it.

04:53.761 --> 04:54.895
Oh, hey. J'onn.

04:54.928 --> 04:57.731
We're ready to send your
message to Mars whenever
you are.

04:57.765 --> 04:58.966
What message?

04:58.999 --> 05:00.934
On Earth it's customary
to send messages
on Valentine's Day.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.803
We had a similar custom
on Mars.

05:02.836 --> 05:04.505
It's too bad
you can't call her.

05:04.538 --> 05:06.574
We Martians are
a psychic people.

05:06.607 --> 05:08.676
All our communication
was through thought.

05:08.709 --> 05:12.112
But when we had something
really important to say,
we would often write it down.

05:12.145 --> 05:15.483
On some planets,
to write something
is to truly say it.

05:15.516 --> 05:17.885
I'm sure M'gann will be
very happy to hear from you.

05:18.652 --> 05:19.653
Thank you.

05:20.788 --> 05:22.690
(SIGHS DEEPLY)

05:22.723 --> 05:25.593
Hey. So,
this Day of Valentine,

05:25.626 --> 05:27.528
is that something we're
supposed to...

05:27.561 --> 05:29.497
-Maybe we should talk
in private...
-Okay, private. This is good.

05:29.530 --> 05:32.966
(CLEARS THROAT)
So, you and me...

05:33.000 --> 05:34.502
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

05:34.535 --> 05:37.771
Um, there was something
happening between us
before

05:37.805 --> 05:39.707
-Mxyzptlk showed up.
-Mmm-hmm.

05:39.740 --> 05:43.444
And I really, really want
to get back to that.
(LAUGHS)

05:43.477 --> 05:45.713
-Oh, yeah. Me, too...
-But first,
I have to get rid of him.

05:45.746 --> 05:49.717
I mean, of all the girls
in all the galaxies, that the
little imp had to pick you

05:49.750 --> 05:51.619
-to pursue you as his mate...
-But don't worry.

05:51.652 --> 05:53.954
Because before you know it,
he's going to be
back in his dimension,

05:53.987 --> 05:57.858
and you and I, we can
celebrate "The Day
of the Valentine" together.

05:58.826 --> 06:00.394
I promise.

06:02.830 --> 06:07.535
Black coffee,
a sesame seed bagel, dry,
double toasted. Gross.

06:07.568 --> 06:09.903
-Thanks, Danvers.
You know me well.
-Yeah.

06:09.937 --> 06:11.439
Oh... What's that?

06:11.472 --> 06:13.006
It's from my mom.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.642
It's kind of silly.

06:14.675 --> 06:16.977
She's always made such a fuss
about Valentine's Day.

06:17.010 --> 06:20.414
Here I am, 28 years old,
and she still sends me
cards.

06:20.448 --> 06:23.651
I always wondered
who bought those.
Let me see this.

06:23.684 --> 06:25.653
"Daughter,
thank you for being
who you are.

06:25.686 --> 06:28.021
"You will always be my star."
Oh, my God...

06:28.055 --> 06:29.557
(BOTH LAUGHING)

06:29.590 --> 06:31.625
I... Yeah,
it's kind of cheesy.

06:31.659 --> 06:34.495
I mean, Valentine's Day's
kind of dumb, right?

06:34.528 --> 06:37.931
The ridiculous notion that
you need a manufactured
holiday

06:37.965 --> 06:39.833
to prove that you care?

06:39.867 --> 06:41.735
It just proves that people
are patsies willing to throw
away money

06:41.769 --> 06:44.171
on cheap chocolate
and wilted roses.

06:44.204 --> 06:45.473
Makes me want to puke.

06:45.506 --> 06:47.741
I hate Valentine's Day.

06:47.775 --> 06:48.842
(CHUCKLES)

06:48.876 --> 06:50.177
Me, too.

06:50.210 --> 06:51.845
I knew we were right
for each other, Danvers.

06:56.517 --> 06:57.785
(EXCLAIMS) Would...

07:00.888 --> 07:02.656
Can I get another
Lallorian lager, please?

07:02.690 --> 07:06.226
-'Cause Valentine's Day sucks.
-(SNARLING)

07:06.259 --> 07:09.162
(STAMMERING)
Was this your spot?

07:09.196 --> 07:12.766
He says Lallorian lager
is for weak-minded idiots.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.034
Like you.

07:14.067 --> 07:17.571
Yeah...
That is a very,
very valid point.

07:17.605 --> 07:22.743
So why don't I buy you
gentlemen something...
Something stronger, right?

07:22.776 --> 07:25.579
-(GRUNTS)
-(SNARLS)

07:25.613 --> 07:29.449
Put the human down.

07:33.253 --> 07:34.855
Whoa.

07:36.857 --> 07:38.626
(GROANING)

07:51.104 --> 07:52.840
I hate bullies.

07:52.873 --> 07:54.608
Yeah, yeah.
I do too.

07:56.009 --> 07:58.912
Thank you for bailing
me out.

07:58.946 --> 08:01.949
Not that I needed it because
I totally had those guys.

08:01.982 --> 08:07.888
Oh, yeah. That guy probably
would've choked to death
on your bones as he ate you.

08:10.290 --> 08:13.193
I mean, that...
That was awesome.

08:13.226 --> 08:14.595
So... (CHUCKLES)

08:14.628 --> 08:16.029
I'm Winn...

08:16.864 --> 08:18.866
Lyra Strayd.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.536
So where you from, Lyra?

08:22.970 --> 08:24.672
Starhaven.

08:24.705 --> 08:27.007
I'm sorry. Star...
Are you serious?

08:27.040 --> 08:30.978
That's the number-one planet
on my bucket list!

08:31.011 --> 08:34.147
My friend told me that
Starhaven's like
most idyllic planet

08:34.181 --> 08:36.149
in the universe.

08:36.183 --> 08:38.085
Right? Like you gotta love any
place where the air smells
like cinnamon.

08:38.118 --> 08:40.053
Smelled like cinnamon.

08:41.722 --> 08:44.024
Clearly your friend hasn't
been off-world in a while.

08:44.057 --> 08:46.960
The blight came and made
the air smell like death.

08:48.061 --> 08:51.565
"The hurt of one
is the hurt of all.

08:51.599 --> 08:55.035
"The honor of one
is the honor of all."

08:55.068 --> 08:56.904
It's a passage I translated
from...

08:56.937 --> 08:59.172
The Book of the
Ten-Pointed Star.

08:59.206 --> 09:01.809
My father read
that to me every
night when I was little.

09:01.842 --> 09:04.011
Wait, are you serious?
That's, like,

09:04.044 --> 09:06.714
the one Starhaven book
I know.

09:06.747 --> 09:08.782
What are the chances?

09:11.351 --> 09:13.721
Have dinner with me tonight.

09:13.754 --> 09:17.825
Really? (STAMMERS)
Like a date?

09:17.858 --> 09:20.360
You do owe me your life.
So...

09:20.393 --> 09:22.596
Yeah, I guess I do...

09:22.630 --> 09:24.832
And it is Valentine's Day.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.701
Yes, it is.

09:30.037 --> 09:31.705
(ALARM BLARING)

09:31.739 --> 09:33.607
We gotta go!

09:33.974 --> 09:34.975
Move!

09:40.981 --> 09:43.851
Hey, boys. What's the hurry?

09:45.953 --> 09:48.922
You're wasting your ammo.
You know they can't hurt me.

09:48.956 --> 09:52.359
MXYZPTLK:
But will bullets hurt them?

09:52.392 --> 09:54.862
-Mxy? What...
-Hello, blossom.

09:57.164 --> 09:58.832
(GROANING)

09:58.866 --> 10:01.702
-What are you doing?
-I saw this in a movie once...

10:02.402 --> 10:03.937
(GUN COCKING)

10:03.971 --> 10:04.972
No!

10:10.410 --> 10:12.746
-Thank you, Supergirl.
-(GRUNTS)

10:12.780 --> 10:16.149
Let the wooing begin.

10:22.089 --> 10:24.057
-Where is Mxyzptlk now?
-I don't know.

10:24.091 --> 10:25.358
He snapped away.

10:25.392 --> 10:28.662
I thought he was just
after me, but he almost
killed those guys.

10:28.696 --> 10:31.331
-He's a lot more dangerous
than I thought.
-Agreed.

10:31.364 --> 10:34.401
Agent Schott, have you found
records of human dealing
with these life forms?

10:34.434 --> 10:38.238
Uh, yes. Actually, lots.
If you just

10:38.271 --> 10:42.342
take from it what you will,
but between genies, djinn
and leprechauns,

10:42.375 --> 10:46.747
I mean, humans have been
documenting contact with
reality-bending creatures

10:46.780 --> 10:48.415
for centuries.

10:48.448 --> 10:50.150
And how did they slay them?

10:50.183 --> 10:52.686
-On Daxam, we crush them.
-What?

10:53.220 --> 10:55.355
No. Absolutely not.

10:55.388 --> 10:57.891
We learned the hard way that
the only way to deal with them
was to kill them quickly.

10:57.925 --> 10:59.727
-Let me...
Let me take care of him.
-No!

10:59.760 --> 11:01.128
No. We don't kill.

11:01.161 --> 11:03.063
I'm not going to let some
imp stalk you and live.

11:03.096 --> 11:05.766
I can take care of myself,
Mon-El.
Let me handle it.

11:05.799 --> 11:08.168
Oh, hey. So we're
going to go non-lethal?

11:08.201 --> 11:09.669
-Yes.
-No.

11:09.703 --> 11:13.173
The DEO has some
recovered alien artifacts
in a sub-basement storeroom.

11:13.206 --> 11:15.943
Maybe one of them can send
Mxyzptlk back to
the Fifth Dimension,

11:15.976 --> 11:17.444
or at least suppress
his powers.

11:17.477 --> 11:19.012

I'll have them brought up.

11:19.046 --> 11:20.848

11:33.526 --> 11:38.065
I can handle Mxyzptlk,
but it's Mon-El
who's infuriating.

11:38.098 --> 11:40.067
He has some grudge
against imps.

11:40.100 --> 11:43.403
-Do you think Mon-El's
jealous?
-(LAUGHS) Uh, no. Of Mxyzptlk?

11:43.436 --> 11:46.139
No. I mean,
that would be crazy.

11:50.978 --> 11:53.246
Though Mxy is persistent.

11:53.981 --> 11:55.315
Yeah...

11:55.348 --> 12:00.220
Oh, hey! Why don't you
take these to Maggie?
Maybe she'll enjoy them.

12:00.253 --> 12:02.122
Oh, um...

12:02.155 --> 12:04.091
What's the matter?

12:04.124 --> 12:06.960
I need some advice
about Valentine's Day.

12:06.994 --> 12:08.962
Oh my God, it's your first
Valentine's Day with Maggie!

12:08.996 --> 12:10.163
That's so exciting!

12:10.197 --> 12:12.900
Oh. You have to go
to Il Palazzo.

12:12.933 --> 12:16.103
The bolognese-stuffed
calamari is to die for.

12:16.136 --> 12:19.339
I'm sure they're booked,
but Ms. Grant was a regular,
so...

12:19.372 --> 12:24.277
Yeah... I don't need
a reservation, Kara.
That's precisely the problem.

12:24.311 --> 12:25.779
Um...

12:25.813 --> 12:28.115
Maggie hates Valentine's Day.

12:28.148 --> 12:30.450
Well, that's...
That's kind of a bummer.

12:30.483 --> 12:35.989
Look, I know. I know it's
silly, but after so many
Valentine's Days alone,

12:36.023 --> 12:39.993
I was just finally excited
to be in a relationship
where we could celebrate

12:40.027 --> 12:42.996
all the cheesy stuff
couples celebrate.

12:43.030 --> 12:45.132
That's not silly at all.

12:45.165 --> 12:48.268
I'm sure she doesn't really
hate Valentine's Day.

12:48.301 --> 12:51.138
She called it a manufactured
holiday for patsies.

12:52.305 --> 12:56.276
Okay... Okay,
so the trimmings aren't
her style,

12:56.309 --> 12:59.446
but you can celebrate
your own way. What kind of
stuff does she like?

12:59.479 --> 13:00.848
I don't know. Guns?

13:02.215 --> 13:03.884
Anything else?

13:03.917 --> 13:06.887
Well, she loves scotch.
You know, that's, um...

13:06.920 --> 13:09.823
-Good.
-And, oh,
she loves tiramisu.

13:09.857 --> 13:12.826
I mean, could eat it for
every meal, literally.

13:12.860 --> 13:14.427
It's like her happy food.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.964
And she loves bonsai trees,

13:16.997 --> 13:20.567
which I know is
totally random, but I mean,
find it adorable.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.903
That's all great.
So why don't you

13:22.936 --> 13:25.372
create a tailor-made Maggie
Valentine's Day?

13:25.405 --> 13:28.375
And you can re-invent
the holiday for
the both of you.

13:29.609 --> 13:32.445
Yeah. Thanks, Kara.

I was handling this, now go.

he didn't snap you
off to Siberia, and plus,

I told you
I was handling it.

Well, Kara, sometimes
you're not a good judge
of what you can handle.

17:12.332 --> 17:15.068
So...
There it is.

17:15.102 --> 17:16.703
-Really?
-Yes.

17:16.736 --> 17:18.571
Is that why you didn't tell me
that the secret
to getting Mxy

17:18.605 --> 17:20.807
off Earth was to get him
to say his name backwards,

17:20.840 --> 17:22.409
because you didn't think
I could handle it?

17:22.442 --> 17:24.677
No, I didn't tell you that
because it never works!

First of all, it's hard enough
to say it forward,

17:27.247 --> 17:30.117
and second of all,
that guy is a motor-mouth,
but he's not stupid.

17:30.150 --> 17:31.518
You should have told me.

17:31.551 --> 17:35.188
You are so hard on me, Kara.

-I mean, that guy... Hey, hey!
-What? God!

He conjured up a
supervillain and set it
loose on National City.

17:40.727 --> 17:43.530
Did you give him an earful?
No... No, no, no.

17:43.563 --> 17:46.333
Because Mxy snaps his fingers,
and there's flowers in your
loft.

17:46.366 --> 17:49.269
And he snaps his fingers,
and you're in Vera Wang...

-Oh, is it?
-You know what, Kara?

I knew you that you were
a little full of yourself,
like, a little bit.

18:00.613 --> 18:02.315
-Full of myself?
-But this is off the charts...

18:02.349 --> 18:04.717
-What do you mean?
-I'm not jealous. Okay?
I'm angry,

18:04.751 --> 18:06.719
because you have an unfair
double standard.

18:06.753 --> 18:09.556
Yeah. You're right,
I don't hold you and Mxy
to the same standard,

18:09.589 --> 18:11.891
because I expect bad behavior
from him, but from you,

18:11.924 --> 18:14.327
-I expect much, much better.
-Oh.

18:14.361 --> 18:16.363
-No, no, no...
-What?

18:16.396 --> 18:18.498
You do not get to
turn this around on me.

18:18.531 --> 18:21.268
Because I'm the one
in this situation,
at this moment...

18:21.301 --> 18:22.735
Good to see you, Dana.

18:22.769 --> 18:24.337
-...that is supposed
to be mad.
-You know what?

18:24.371 --> 18:26.839

I really did,

18:26.873 --> 18:29.842
-but you are still the same

-Yes!

-He's a Daxamite!
-As you've always been.

Mmm-hmm.

18:35.448 --> 18:36.849

you and me.
-Agreed.

18:36.883 --> 18:38.885
-We shouldn't have...
-Nope.

Good.

18:43.323 --> 18:45.592
-So, are you going
to kill the imp?
-No.

18:48.928 --> 18:50.730
Hey, pal. How's it going?

18:50.763 --> 18:55.668
Oh, you know.
Believe it or not,
I'm having a girl issue.

18:55.702 --> 18:58.505
-Good timing.
-Hey. Hey,
you're great with girls.

18:58.538 --> 19:00.207

at you left and right.

pearl.

19:04.344 --> 19:06.613
-Come on.
-Yeah. Uh...

19:06.646 --> 19:08.848
Things were a lot easier
on Daxam,
when I objectified women

19:08.881 --> 19:10.250
and didn't care about anyone.

19:10.783 --> 19:12.885
-So...
-Okay.

19:12.919 --> 19:16.656
I feel you.

19:21.361 --> 19:23.496
Ah! We look with our eyes,
okay?

19:23.930 --> 19:25.665
See?

19:25.698 --> 19:27.734
Now, I know that the "E"
in DEO stands for, like,
"Extra-Normal,"

19:27.767 --> 19:32.305
but this...
I did not know we had
stuff like this, dude.

19:34.006 --> 19:35.642
What would this do to the imp?

19:35.675 --> 19:39.212
I have almost no Earthly
idea, but it tested off
the charts

19:39.246 --> 19:40.947
on Fifth Dimensional energy.

19:40.980 --> 19:43.316
Now, the spectrometer needs
to update before
I can do anything else.

19:43.350 --> 19:44.417
It's going to take,
like, six hours, so...

19:44.451 --> 19:45.718
-(CELLPHONE CHIMES)
-Oh...

19:45.752 --> 19:48.621

I'm going to go be brave,

19:48.655 --> 19:53.460
and go to Valentine's Day
dinner with, uh, that girl.

-Godspeed.
-Yeah.

20:05.838 --> 20:07.206

20:23.490 --> 20:26.293
Hey, I was just about
to make my entrance,

20:26.326 --> 20:31.364
but I can't without
the lights and music.

20:32.432 --> 20:34.967
You're not happy?

20:35.001 --> 20:36.736
I told you I hate
Valentine's Day.

20:36.769 --> 20:39.839
What part of that got lost
in translation?

20:39.872 --> 20:44.344
I'm sorry, I just thought
maybe I could change
your mind.

20:44.377 --> 20:47.814
I have one pet peeve,
Danvers,
and that's not being heard.

20:49.616 --> 20:51.318
Okay.

20:51.351 --> 20:53.486
-I'm listening.
-No, forget it.
I'm outta here.

20:53.520 --> 20:54.687
Hey, no!

20:55.855 --> 20:58.358
You don't get to just
walk out, Maggie.

20:58.391 --> 21:00.026
This is a relationship.

21:00.059 --> 21:03.363
You're the one who told me
not to push my feelings down,
so...

21:04.063 --> 21:05.532
Now it's your turn.

21:05.565 --> 21:06.966
(STAMMERS) You want to know?

21:06.999 --> 21:08.968
-Yeah.
-Okay, yeah, fine.

21:09.001 --> 21:12.672
When I told you that
my parents were supportive
of my coming out, I lied.

21:13.373 --> 21:14.574
What?

21:14.607 --> 21:17.477
I had this friend when
I was 14, Elisa Wilkey.

21:17.510 --> 21:22.449
We'd hang out
in her parents' basement,
watching horror flicks,

21:22.482 --> 21:25.452
and smoking cigarettes.
I...

21:25.485 --> 21:31.324
She was the first girl that
I knew that I liked in a way
that was different.

21:31.358 --> 21:33.360
And I thought that she
liked me, too.

21:33.393 --> 21:39.666
And so on Valentine's Day,
I put a card in her locker
declaring my feelings,

21:39.699 --> 21:42.335
and asking her to the dance.
Well...

21:44.571 --> 21:47.073
She gave that card
to her parents.

21:47.106 --> 21:49.609
And then they called
my parents.

21:49.642 --> 21:51.811
And that's how I was outed.

21:54.981 --> 21:58.551
And then my dad kicked me out,
and I had to live with
an aunt for three years.

21:59.852 --> 22:02.989
-Maggie, I'm... I'm sorry.
-Yeah, whatever.

22:03.022 --> 22:06.826
But I don't understand.
Why didn't you just
tell me the truth?

22:06.859 --> 22:11.898
I didn't want to scare you.
Okay? I wanted it to be better
for you.

22:13.466 --> 22:15.402
I gotta go.

22:15.435 --> 22:17.670
(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)

22:25.912 --> 22:27.046
WINN: Hey.

22:27.079 --> 22:29.849
Hey, hey! I'm so sorry.
Sorry I'm late.

22:29.882 --> 22:31.918
-Better have a good reason.
-I do.

22:31.951 --> 22:36.389
I just got us reservations
at Saxon's, which,
on Valentine's Day,

22:36.423 --> 22:39.926
is, like, harder than getting
a Hellgrammite to
eat leafy greens, so...

22:39.959 --> 22:42.462
So we are set for 8:00.
Um...

22:42.495 --> 22:47.634
And you can tell me about
Starhaven, and I'll tell you
about growing up in Newark.

22:47.667 --> 22:49.969
And then I thought we'd get
a nightcap.

22:50.002 --> 22:52.639
You know, just talk some more.
I just feel like, um,

22:52.672 --> 22:56.643
when dating, it's better to
get to know each other...

22:59.011 --> 23:01.147
I want you.

23:01.180 --> 23:03.382
Yeah. That's good, too.

23:04.517 --> 23:06.486
(CLATTERING)

23:07.487 --> 23:09.822
Kill... Tip... Seize... Um...

23:09.856 --> 23:11.758
Kltpzy...

23:11.791 --> 23:13.025
Kltpzyxm...

23:13.059 --> 23:14.193
Kltpzyxm!

23:14.226 --> 23:15.628
What language is that?

23:15.662 --> 23:18.064
It's Mxyzptlk
spelled backwards.

23:18.097 --> 23:21.668
Maybe Mon-El was right.
I mean, how am I going
to get him to say this?

23:21.701 --> 23:23.703
I hope Winn found something
that will work.

23:23.736 --> 23:25.605
-Where is he?
-He should be here.

23:25.638 --> 23:28.107
Most of the relics tested
negative for
Fifth Dimensional energy,

23:28.140 --> 23:30.910
however, there was one
that might be of some use.

23:32.078 --> 23:33.513
J'ONN: Odd.

23:35.014 --> 23:36.483
Mon-El.

23:36.516 --> 23:37.684
Mxyzptlk!

23:38.818 --> 23:42.489
Show yourself, you smug,
grand-standing dandy.

23:42.522 --> 23:46.626
Oh, bummer sticks.
It's just you.

23:46.659 --> 23:48.895
I've come to
challenge you, Mxyzptlk.

23:48.928 --> 23:50.597
A Daxamite duel?

23:50.630 --> 23:51.998
I never had one
of those before.

23:53.633 --> 23:54.667
-For Kara's hand?
-Yes.

23:54.701 --> 23:55.702
-To the death?
-Yes.

23:55.735 --> 23:57.504
-I accept.
-Good.

23:57.537 --> 23:59.205
-But first...
-Buddy.

23:59.238 --> 24:01.541
If we're going to take part
in a proper duel,
we're gonna do it

24:01.574 --> 24:03.643
like the gentlemen
that we are.

24:05.812 --> 24:06.979
What the...

24:07.013 --> 24:09.482
How do you like the duds,
Monsieur Hamilton?

24:10.983 --> 24:15.688
I'm a Burr man, myself.
He gets a bad rap,
but let's be honest,

24:15.722 --> 24:18.958
he was the one who knew
his way around a pistol.

24:18.991 --> 24:21.928
Pistols at dawn!
So revolutionary.

24:22.929 --> 24:23.930
I love it.

24:25.732 --> 24:27.700
So if I shoot you with this,
you'll die?

24:27.734 --> 24:29.902
That is generally
how these things work, yes.

24:29.936 --> 24:31.771
But don't throw away
your shot,

24:31.804 --> 24:32.972
because you'll only get one.

24:34.140 --> 24:35.508
I only need one.

24:39.278 --> 24:40.813
(LAUGHS)

24:43.950 --> 24:45.051
(GROANS)

24:45.084 --> 24:47.520
Did you really think
I would hand you
a loaded gun

24:47.554 --> 24:48.988
that could actually kill me?

24:49.021 --> 24:52.625
You Daxamites really
are thick, aren't you?

24:57.129 --> 24:59.599
-Oh, no.
-Oh, yes.

25:07.674 --> 25:10.843
You may have cut me off
from the Fifth Dimension,
Daxamite,

25:10.877 --> 25:15.014
but I still know
a thing or two
about the old fisticuffs.

25:21.788 --> 25:22.922
(GROANS)

25:23.956 --> 25:25.524
Whoo!

25:26.192 --> 25:27.594
(YELLS)

25:29.796 --> 25:32.799
How could you think she'd
ever want to be
with someone like you?

25:32.832 --> 25:34.634
Why, you think she's gonna
be with you?

25:34.667 --> 25:36.102
Face it, what do you've got
to offer her?

25:36.135 --> 25:37.870
I can give her anything.

25:37.904 --> 25:39.806
There's no contest between
you and me,
and you know it.

25:39.839 --> 25:42.041
I'm a God and you're a loser!

25:43.009 --> 25:43.810
(GRUNTING)

25:43.843 --> 25:46.813
-You're a dead man.
-Strike that.

25:47.346 --> 25:48.681
Reverse it.

25:52.985 --> 25:55.121
I hear you're allergic
to lead.

25:57.957 --> 25:58.991
Stop!

25:59.926 --> 26:01.694
-Kara.
-Sweetheart.

26:01.728 --> 26:03.129
This volatile maniac
tried to kill me!

26:03.162 --> 26:05.197
It'll be better for all of us
once I snuff him out.

26:05.231 --> 26:06.699
I'll marry you!

26:06.733 --> 26:08.034
-You will?
-You will?

26:09.869 --> 26:14.173
Yes, I've thought about it,
and you're right.

26:14.206 --> 26:18.210
You're gifted, brilliant,
and together
we can do anything.

26:18.244 --> 26:20.079
Take me as your wife.

26:20.112 --> 26:22.815
Darling, you and I are going
to be the ultimate power
couple.

26:22.849 --> 26:26.753
-Kara, no...
-He talks too much.

26:26.786 --> 26:28.254
Let's get this show
on the road.

26:28.287 --> 26:31.257
I'll get our officiant,
you want the Pope,
a Lubavitcher Rabbi?

26:31.290 --> 26:34.861
It would mean the world to me
if I followed proper
Kryptonian custom

26:34.894 --> 26:37.196
and got married on the soil
of my people.

26:37.229 --> 26:39.098
Kryptonian soil coming up.

26:39.131 --> 26:42.735
No. I meant... I meant
the Fortress of Solitude.

26:43.903 --> 26:45.972
I'll wear my mother's dress.

26:46.005 --> 26:48.140
So meet me there
tomorrow at noon.

26:48.174 --> 26:49.776
I'll see you soon...

26:53.012 --> 26:54.013
Wife.

27:01.187 --> 27:02.254
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

27:02.288 --> 27:03.923
Yes, I'm coming.

27:04.757 --> 27:05.925
Thank God you're still here!

27:05.958 --> 27:08.060
-Mon-El...
-It's not too late.

27:08.094 --> 27:11.397
Okay? You're right.
You're right, okay?

27:11.430 --> 27:13.299
I'm jealous.

27:13.332 --> 27:17.704
I wish I could snap my fingers
and give you anything
you wish for,

27:17.737 --> 27:20.072
and it kills me that he can do
that stuff for you
and I can't.

27:20.106 --> 27:23.142
And I acted badly, okay?
Very badly.

27:23.175 --> 27:26.245
But please...
Please do not marry him.

27:26.278 --> 27:29.048
-I will be better for you...
-It's not just the jealousy
thing, Mon-El.

27:29.081 --> 27:31.884
It's the patronizing
ego thing.

27:31.918 --> 27:34.220
I told you I could handle Mxy,
and you didn't listen.

27:34.253 --> 27:36.689
I swear to Rao,
I will listen, Kara.

27:36.723 --> 27:39.425
I will respect you,
just please, just give
me another chance...

27:39.458 --> 27:41.127
I'm sorry. I can't.

27:41.961 --> 27:44.063
I'm marrying Mxyzptlk.

27:46.332 --> 27:47.834
Kara, no.

27:47.867 --> 27:49.468
Look, I'm not
in love with him,

27:49.501 --> 27:52.739
but it's the only way
to stop him
from hurting other people,

27:52.772 --> 27:54.273
and from killing you.

27:54.306 --> 27:56.475
And you know what?
He makes an
excellent point.

27:56.508 --> 28:00.813
He has limitless power that
he can use to help me fight
for justice.

28:02.348 --> 28:03.883
We'll make a great team.

28:08.154 --> 28:10.222
I thought we were going
to do that.

28:15.527 --> 28:17.263
We're too different, Mon-El.

28:28.107 --> 28:29.108
I'm sorry.

28:39.485 --> 28:40.853
(SIGHS)

28:47.126 --> 28:48.127
Alex?

28:49.361 --> 28:50.830
Hey, Kara. Alex around?

28:50.863 --> 28:52.832
I was looking for her, too.
She's not here.

28:52.865 --> 28:54.400
I was hoping
I could see her.

28:54.433 --> 28:57.870
I need to apologize.
I acted like an idiot
last night.

28:59.471 --> 29:02.842
Look, I know
Valentine's Day might not
be happy for you,

29:02.875 --> 29:04.376
but it means something to Alex

29:04.410 --> 29:09.381
to spend a romantic holiday
with someone she cares about.

29:09.415 --> 29:13.285
Maybe you might want to
consider making some changes
for her.

29:17.423 --> 29:18.791
I gotta go.

29:24.263 --> 29:26.132
Kara, darling!

29:26.933 --> 29:28.300
Where are you?

29:29.301 --> 29:31.838
It's time! Kara!

29:31.871 --> 29:34.240
You said noon and here I am!

29:35.875 --> 29:38.110
-Kara!
-I can hear you.

29:42.081 --> 29:45.351
Where's the dress?
The flowers?
The pigs in blankets?

29:50.156 --> 29:51.290
Ah...

29:52.124 --> 29:54.293
See, that's the thing, Mxy.

29:55.361 --> 29:57.429
I'm not going to marry you.

29:57.463 --> 30:00.566
-What do you mean?
-I brought you to the Fortress
in case you got violent again.

30:00.599 --> 30:04.570
'Cause I didn't want anyone
to get hurt when
I broke the news.

30:04.603 --> 30:07.139
It's not going to work
between us.

30:07.173 --> 30:08.540
Ever.

30:08.574 --> 30:10.943
But you said...

30:10.977 --> 30:14.546
-You don't love me?
-Love isn't making demands
of someone,

30:14.580 --> 30:16.482
or forcing them to marry you.

30:16.515 --> 30:21.053
Love is putting someone else's
needs above your own.

30:21.087 --> 30:25.457
So you brought me all the way
up here just to reject me?

30:25.491 --> 30:28.394
I think you're going to have
to explain your catastrophic
lack of judgment

30:28.427 --> 30:30.062
to your family.

30:30.096 --> 30:32.198
What's that, Uncle Jor-El?

30:32.231 --> 30:36.202
If you have to hold Kara down
till she sees reason and
becomes my bride, you will?

30:49.615 --> 30:52.018
I offered you the world,
Kara Zor-El.

30:52.051 --> 30:53.319
Anything you wanted.

30:53.352 --> 30:54.887
And you reject it all?

30:54.921 --> 30:56.989
I could have made you
a god, like me.

31:01.427 --> 31:02.428
(GRUNTS)

31:04.696 --> 31:09.468
I don't want to be a god, Mxy.
I just want you off of Earth.

31:09.501 --> 31:12.438
You don't get to tell me
what to do until after
we're married!

31:14.540 --> 31:15.908
Sorry, Uncle Jor-El.

31:32.724 --> 31:35.061
You think this is the worst
it can get?

31:35.094 --> 31:37.296
One snap and I'll crack
your world in half.

31:37.329 --> 31:39.065
Then where will you go,
Kryptonian?

31:39.098 --> 31:40.332
I will hound you across
the stars, Kara,

31:40.366 --> 31:41.700
until you admit
that you love me.

31:41.733 --> 31:44.003
I'm done with this, Mxyzptlk.

31:44.036 --> 31:45.537
And I'm done with you.

31:45.571 --> 31:46.939
You wanna get nuts?

31:47.974 --> 31:49.141
Let's get nuts.

31:50.609 --> 31:53.412
FEMALE AUTOMATED VOICE:
Now sealing the
Fortress of Solitude.

31:53.445 --> 31:54.446
What are you doing?

31:54.480 --> 31:56.548
Setting the Atomic Cauldron
to self-destruct.

31:56.582 --> 31:58.484
The Atomic whatnow?

31:58.517 --> 32:01.353
The Fortress has one
of the most powerful
fusion furnaces on Earth.

32:01.387 --> 32:03.289
I'm overloading the
Sunstones at its core.

32:03.322 --> 32:07.226
Okay, well, Kara.
Let's not be too hasty, huh?

32:07.259 --> 32:09.628
-Maybe we should...
-Atomic Cauldron fusion

32:09.661 --> 32:11.964
increased 2,000%.

32:11.998 --> 32:16.202
When the Cauldron goes up,
it'll explode with the force
of a 400-megaton bomb.

32:16.235 --> 32:20.639
The Fortress is sealed so
should contain the blast,
but anyone inside it will...

32:20.672 --> 32:24.110
-This sounds bad.
-You can't stop me
from killing myself.

32:24.143 --> 32:26.045
It's in the rules.

32:26.078 --> 32:31.450
Okay. There's only room
for one crazy person
in this relationship.

32:31.483 --> 32:34.386
Maybe we should just, um,
control-alt-delete this,

32:34.420 --> 32:37.589
and we can talk it
over with a cup of
Thoni tea.

32:37.623 --> 32:42.228
Being with you would mean
being at odds every day with
my heart, Mxyzptlk.

32:42.261 --> 32:44.596
I'd rather die in here
than be with you.

32:44.630 --> 32:47.733
Atomic Cauldron detonation
countdown initiated.

32:47.766 --> 32:49.435
Well, here's the thing.

32:49.468 --> 32:51.070
I'm calling your bluff.

32:51.103 --> 32:52.504
I don't believe that
you'd destroy all of this.

32:52.538 --> 32:55.741
Atomic Cauldron detonation
in one minute.

32:55.774 --> 32:58.610
Okay, please.
I'll do anything.

32:58.644 --> 33:00.446
Just don't die.

33:00.479 --> 33:03.649
I'm sorry.
I'm not going to tell you
the cancellation code.

33:03.682 --> 33:05.484
So there's a code?

33:08.720 --> 33:10.356
I can't read this.

33:12.524 --> 33:16.228
Atomic Cauldron detonation
in 30 seconds.

33:16.262 --> 33:19.131
I don't have time to learn
your stupid moon language!

33:21.400 --> 33:24.370
Please, Supergirl.
I'm literally begging you.
Don't do this.

33:24.403 --> 33:26.272
I'll do anything.
You want world peace?
You got it.

33:26.305 --> 33:29.641
I can make that happen.
Just don't kill yourself.

33:29.675 --> 33:31.343
The world needs Supergirl.

33:31.377 --> 33:34.213
Fifteen seconds to
Atomic Cauldron detonation.

33:34.246 --> 33:36.215
Please. Tell me the code.

33:39.151 --> 33:40.786
Push that one.

33:40.819 --> 33:42.654
-Yes.
-That one.

33:42.688 --> 33:45.191
-Five seconds to
Atomic Cauldron detonation.
-That one.

33:45.224 --> 33:47.559
-Uh... This one.
-Four.

33:47.593 --> 33:50.562
-That, that and that.
-Three, two...

33:52.331 --> 33:56.068
-Atomic Cauldron
detonation canceled.
-Yes!

34:00.406 --> 34:02.141
No.

34:02.174 --> 34:03.475
You made me write
my name backwards.

34:03.509 --> 34:08.647
Yup. On some planets,
to write something down
is to truly say it.

34:08.680 --> 34:11.317
-You tricked me.
-No.

34:11.350 --> 34:13.419
No, I followed the rules.

34:13.452 --> 34:15.354
If you say your name
backwards,

34:15.387 --> 34:17.156
you go back to
the Fifth Dimension,
no questions asked.

34:17.189 --> 34:20.626
That's it, you nasty woman.

34:20.659 --> 34:22.094
Now I'm gonna...

34:24.530 --> 34:26.232
No. It's started.

34:28.634 --> 34:33.372
I just wanted...
I wanted someone
to love me.

34:33.405 --> 34:35.641
You can't force love,
Mxyzptlk,

34:36.875 --> 34:38.577
you have to let it find you.

34:55.627 --> 34:56.628
(EXHALES)

34:59.898 --> 35:01.267
WINN: Hey.

35:02.668 --> 35:04.370
Hey.

35:04.403 --> 35:06.138
Everyone is staring at me.

35:06.172 --> 35:07.339
Let them stare.

35:09.175 --> 35:13.612
You... I mean,
you look just beautiful.

35:16.282 --> 35:17.916
-I didn't think you'd call.
-Why?

35:17.949 --> 35:24.190
Last night was, like,
beyond amazing
on just so many levels.

35:24.223 --> 35:27.159
I figured it was a one-time
thing for you.

35:27.693 --> 35:29.728
An experience.

35:29.761 --> 35:33.665
I've never met a human that
was actually up for dating
an alien.

35:35.801 --> 35:38.437
Well, now you have.

35:38.470 --> 35:40.639
Look, I'm not...
I'm not naive, okay?

35:40.672 --> 35:46.312
I know that there are lots
of people who don't think that
humans and aliens should mix.

35:46.345 --> 35:48.680
If we're being super honest,

35:49.781 --> 35:52.318
potentially

35:52.351 --> 35:57.523
falling for an alien is not
what scares me.

35:57.556 --> 36:01.760
It's falling for anyone.
Just have kind of

36:03.295 --> 36:06.232
had my heart trampled on
a few times.

36:07.866 --> 36:09.235
Me, too.

36:10.302 --> 36:14.206
You aren't like some
experience to me, okay?

36:14.240 --> 36:20.279
You're a potentially
real, fulfilling,
challenging relationship

36:20.312 --> 36:24.250
and that's just way
too much chaos.
That's too fast...

36:24.283 --> 36:28.320
Whoo-hoo.
Just gonna... Um...

36:28.354 --> 36:31.757
What do you say we just...
We take it slow?

36:33.592 --> 36:34.593
Sure.

36:35.694 --> 36:36.695
Okay.

36:41.733 --> 36:42.768
Slow.

36:44.936 --> 36:46.972
Take me to where you live.

36:47.005 --> 36:50.242
Yes, ma'am.

36:56.882 --> 36:58.250
Maggie?

37:17.035 --> 37:18.804
Wow, you're breathtaking.

37:20.071 --> 37:21.707
Maggie, what is all this?

37:21.740 --> 37:24.543
It's your belated
Valentine's Day prom.

37:25.711 --> 37:26.712
May I?

37:33.719 --> 37:35.253
I'm sorry.

37:35.821 --> 37:37.356
So sorry.

37:37.389 --> 37:39.558
I was too busy nursing
my old wounds,

37:39.591 --> 37:42.894
and I forgot to look at
the gorgeous woman
in front of me,

37:42.928 --> 37:44.663
and consider her feelings.

37:44.696 --> 37:48.033
You deserved
all of this as a girl,
the pomp and the fuss.

37:48.066 --> 37:51.403
And you deserve
an amazing romance

37:51.437 --> 37:54.640
with the woman who's
absolutely crazy about you.

37:56.475 --> 37:58.377
Don't you hate all this?

37:58.410 --> 38:01.580
Alex, you're the one woman
that could make me
like Valentine's Day.

38:07.853 --> 38:09.721
May I have this dance?

38:10.389 --> 38:12.624
Yeah... Yes!

38:23.101 --> 38:24.636
Hi.

38:24.670 --> 38:25.671
Hi.

38:26.772 --> 38:29.575
Can I... Thanks.

38:29.608 --> 38:34.513
(STAMMERING)
Hey, I just wanted to
let you know that

38:35.414 --> 38:36.582
you're awesome.

38:37.483 --> 38:38.884
No, you are.

38:38.917 --> 38:43.389
You out-tricked the most
cunning intergalactic
trickster,

38:43.422 --> 38:46.692
and you did it your way,
without violence,

38:46.725 --> 38:49.395
which I never should have
doubted because you're...

38:49.428 --> 38:50.962
You know, you're you.

38:50.996 --> 38:52.498
Thanks.

38:52.531 --> 38:54.500
I also wanted to say

38:55.867 --> 38:56.868
I'm sorry.

38:58.404 --> 38:59.971
For acting like an ass.

39:00.005 --> 39:03.375
I've been giving it a lot
of thought and I have
realized

39:07.012 --> 39:09.481
that you are my Kryptonite.

39:10.115 --> 39:12.150
-Me?
-Oh, uh...

39:12.183 --> 39:16.555
No, I mean,
my feelings for you.

39:16.588 --> 39:20.859
I've never felt like this
about anyone in my life...

39:20.892 --> 39:25.130
I didn't know that there were
this many feelings to
even be had.

39:25.163 --> 39:29.401
My emotions,
I guess they made me
kind of crazy.

39:29.435 --> 39:30.602
Yeah...

39:30.636 --> 39:32.471
I totally get it, yeah.

39:32.504 --> 39:35.807
Anyway, I'm really glad
you're okay.

39:35.841 --> 39:39.478
And I'm really, really happy
that you didn't marry
that guy.

39:39.511 --> 39:40.679
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

39:41.680 --> 39:43.014
Me too.

39:43.048 --> 39:44.416
Anyway, um...

39:45.517 --> 39:47.653
I'll get...
I'll get out of your hair.

39:47.686 --> 39:50.889
Wait. Don't go yet.
Please.

39:54.593 --> 39:59.631
I get that you were upset
that I wasn't listening
to you and I...

39:59.665 --> 40:03.669
I tried really, really, really
hard to listen to you
this time.

40:05.203 --> 40:07.773
And I heard that you...

40:07.806 --> 40:10.842
You don't think that we
belong together,
and I respected that.

40:10.876 --> 40:13.979
No, but Mxy wasn't
the only one I tricked.

40:16.548 --> 40:17.883
I didn't mean it.

40:18.950 --> 40:21.453
I just said it so
you'd let me go

40:22.187 --> 40:23.555
to protect you.

40:26.892 --> 40:29.427
Plus, he could have
been listening, so...

40:34.065 --> 40:35.701
Wait.

40:35.734 --> 40:37.803
Wait, so you didn't mean any
of that stuff that you said?

40:37.836 --> 40:41.673
Well, the first bit
about your infuriating
male ego,

40:41.707 --> 40:43.709
that part I meant.

40:43.742 --> 40:47.112
-Okay, okay.
-(KARA LAUGHS)

40:47.145 --> 40:51.883
But the second part about
us not being a match...

40:54.620 --> 40:56.488
I didn't mean that.

40:59.224 --> 41:00.592
Wow.

41:01.593 --> 41:04.696
No, you're good. You are good.

41:04.730 --> 41:06.064
(LAUGHS)

41:12.604 --> 41:14.472
Well, you

41:15.273 --> 41:16.875
got rid of Mxy...

41:17.743 --> 41:18.877
I did.

41:20.145 --> 41:21.713
That means nothing is...

41:23.281 --> 41:25.751
Nothing is stopping us.

41:25.784 --> 41:28.820
Nope. Nothing is stopping us.
