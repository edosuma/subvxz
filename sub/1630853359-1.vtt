WEBVTT

03:43.267 --> 03:44.600
Sir.

03:50.767 --> 03:52.534
Which way to Kirklees?

04:04.400 --> 04:05.400
My thanks.

04:35.601 --> 04:37.667
If we can get the gable up

04:37.701 --> 04:40.367
and the canvas over before
nightfall,

04:40.400 --> 04:44.067
We'll have shelter of sorts.

04:50.767 --> 04:52.467
It's a new start for us.

04:54.400 --> 04:55.867
You'll thank me for it.

05:09.767 --> 05:12.367
We'll dine on finer fair
tomorrow.

05:12.400 --> 05:13.400
Mark my words.

05:23.367 --> 05:25.667
Thank you for coming to our aid.

05:26.400 --> 05:29.067
I wouldn't have asked
but winter overtook us

05:29.100 --> 05:30.433
and we were desperate.

05:36.367 --> 05:37.501
- I'm sorry.
- Rebecca, no.

05:37.534 --> 05:39.734
- Stop that, stop!
- Run, run!

05:39.767 --> 05:43.067
Run!

05:44.300 --> 05:48.167
The new sheriff might turn
a blind eye to poachers,

05:48.200 --> 05:50.467
but the King's deer are my duty,

05:50.501 --> 05:53.067
and you've killed your last one.

05:53.100 --> 05:54.400
Take him, lads!

06:16.501 --> 06:18.434
Stand up, you fools! Get him!

06:21.200 --> 06:22.267
Come on!

06:32.100 --> 06:33.100
Damn.

08:28.534 --> 08:31.467
I am impressed as always, Lady
Prioress,

08:32.100 --> 08:34.567
with your commitment to the task
at hand.

08:34.601 --> 08:36.300
One would be a fool to ignore

08:36.334 --> 08:38.634
the changing seasons, Your
Grace.

08:41.501 --> 08:43.534
Winter bears no love for the
unprepared.

08:43.567 --> 08:45.367
Indeed, Your Grace.

08:46.534 --> 08:48.734
Come, come! Enough chattering!

08:48.767 --> 08:51.033
Faster, please.

08:51.067 --> 08:52.700
We have much work to do.

08:56.300 --> 09:00.133
Where were you? Sister
Agnes is on the warpath again.

09:00.167 --> 09:01.610
Give the world your burdens
and the Lord

09:01.634 --> 09:03.001
will take care of you.

09:03.534 --> 09:06.067
Sister Matilda, where have you
been?

09:06.100 --> 09:08.534
Your duties have been
found wanting yet again.

09:08.567 --> 09:10.867
I'm sorry, sister, I lost
sense of time.

09:11.667 --> 09:13.367
If you are too lazy to plough,

09:13.400 --> 09:15.867
do not expect to reap the
harvest.

09:17.534 --> 09:19.734
Quite why the good Lady
Prioress accepted you

09:19.767 --> 09:22.001
into the novitiate, I will never
know.

09:23.067 --> 09:24.067
Sister Agnes.

09:31.534 --> 09:34.834
Messages, sister, from
Nottingham.

09:38.067 --> 09:40.400
- Thank you.
- Oh, there is another.

09:46.100 --> 09:48.534
- This is odd.
- What is it?

09:48.567 --> 09:51.801
Never you mind. News for
higher minds than yours.

09:52.467 --> 09:54.667
- Sister Gaynor.
- Uh, thank you.

09:54.701 --> 09:56.834
Sister Barbara, two for you
this month.

09:58.334 --> 10:00.667
And even one for Sister Matilda.

10:00.701 --> 10:01.534
The day is getting stranger.

10:01.567 --> 10:03.667
I wasn't aware you kept
correspondence

10:03.701 --> 10:05.334
outside of the priory.

10:05.367 --> 10:08.367
Only you and our good
Lord, Sister Agnes.

10:16.067 --> 10:17.067
Lady Prioress.

10:19.701 --> 10:22.801
- A message.
- From the sheriff, my lady.

10:33.734 --> 10:37.067
Father, have terrible news.

11:00.667 --> 11:02.400
Lady Prioress, I was just, um-

11:02.434 --> 11:06.667
- King Richard, Lord bless him,
is dead.

11:07.501 --> 11:10.100
Killed in a siege in France.

11:10.133 --> 11:11.567
That's terrible news.

11:11.601 --> 11:14.634
Naturally, that means the war
is over.

11:16.167 --> 11:19.334
Most likely many of his
soldiers will return home

11:19.367 --> 11:21.234
to see their loved ones while
they can.

11:21.267 --> 11:22.867
Won't you think?

11:23.734 --> 11:25.001
I wouldn't know.

11:29.767 --> 11:33.234
Sister Matilda, you've
been with us for how long?

11:33.267 --> 11:35.634
Three years this past October.

11:35.667 --> 11:39.801
Three years. Yes, that
would be about right.

11:40.667 --> 11:42.467
And in those three years,

11:42.501 --> 11:46.467
I've watched you go about
your prayers and your duties.

11:46.501 --> 11:49.334
I've watched you every day,

11:49.367 --> 11:51.467
and on each and every one of
those days,

11:51.501 --> 11:54.267
you have borne out that which I
suspected

11:54.300 --> 11:56.334
the very first time I laid eyes
upon you.

11:56.367 --> 11:58.501
I wouldn't know what you mean.

12:00.334 --> 12:04.133
Sister Matilda, of all the
ladies

12:04.167 --> 12:06.400
who have taken to the cloth,

12:06.434 --> 12:10.467
you are by far the worst I've
ever seen.

12:12.300 --> 12:14.234
There is no hope for you.

12:14.267 --> 12:17.467
You were never truly
here to serve the Lord.

12:17.501 --> 12:19.967
You've been marking time,

12:20.701 --> 12:24.667
pacing the clusters like a caged
animal waiting for release.

12:26.634 --> 12:29.734
- I'm sorry, I-
- No, I'm sorry, Matilda.

12:30.501 --> 12:32.701
Sadly, the only solution when
dealing

12:32.734 --> 12:36.667
with such a poorly-suited
candidate is dismissal.

12:36.701 --> 12:38.934
- You want me to leave?
- I do.

12:39.634 --> 12:42.033
I would order you to
gather your belongings

12:42.067 --> 12:46.234
and leave immediately, but I
see you are already prepared.

12:46.267 --> 12:47.734
Good.

12:47.767 --> 12:50.601
- Lady Prioress-
- You are free, Matilda.

12:50.634 --> 12:53.334
Go and find your soldier while
you can.

12:53.367 --> 12:56.734
Quickly before Sister Agnes
tries to mend you ways again.

12:56.767 --> 12:58.410
Lady Prioress, I don't
know how to thank you.

12:58.434 --> 13:01.734
Well then don't. Is it far?

13:01.767 --> 13:04.634
Um, Ashgate. I meet him
by the ruin in Ashgate.

13:04.667 --> 13:06.634
Uh, I don't know the ruin,

13:06.667 --> 13:08.701
but Ashgate is a tidy way off.

13:08.734 --> 13:10.467
Best you hurry along now.

13:10.501 --> 13:13.834
You spent enough time in
this old place, Matilda, go!

13:13.868 --> 13:16.433
Uh, thank you. Thank you.

17:05.200 --> 17:07.200
- Marian, wait!
- Robin.

17:18.234 --> 17:19.601
What was that?

17:19.634 --> 17:21.267
Oh, what was that?

17:21.300 --> 17:22.767
Three years!

17:23.467 --> 17:25.234
- Ooh!
- Three years!

17:25.267 --> 17:26.834
Oh my God!

17:26.868 --> 17:28.501
All Bible studies and prayers

17:28.534 --> 17:30.300
whilst you follow Richard to
paradise!

17:30.334 --> 17:31.601
What can I do? He's the king.

17:31.634 --> 17:34.200
You left me to rot! You
should've sent for me!

17:40.167 --> 17:43.133
How could I? We were fighting
a war!

17:46.400 --> 17:49.267
We're in a foreign country,
hundreds of miles away.

17:49.300 --> 17:52.434
And I promise you, it wasn't
paradise.

17:52.467 --> 17:55.167
I would have gone for you.

17:55.200 --> 17:56.300
I know.

17:57.467 --> 17:59.701
And I'll come back for you.

18:06.634 --> 18:09.567
Uh!

18:16.234 --> 18:17.734
I always wondered who lived
here.

18:17.767 --> 18:19.234
Besides us, you mean.

18:19.267 --> 18:21.133
You know what I mean.

18:21.167 --> 18:22.567
Way back in the past,

18:22.601 --> 18:24.734
someone built this place

18:24.767 --> 18:27.567
and maybe lifted it for silk
trees.

18:27.601 --> 18:29.267
But now look at it.

18:29.300 --> 18:31.200
It's just tumbled down and
forgotten.

18:31.234 --> 18:32.767
Just lost in the woods.

18:34.167 --> 18:35.310
Maybe no one except us will ever
notice.

18:35.334 --> 18:36.767
Even here.

18:36.801 --> 18:39.234
Sometimes things are
better lost or forgotten.

18:39.267 --> 18:40.534
True.

18:41.467 --> 18:44.200
You know I'm sorry, don't you?

18:44.234 --> 18:45.433
I know.

18:46.067 --> 18:47.343
I didn't wanna leave you, but
I just...

18:47.367 --> 18:50.734
Duty. Kings.

18:50.767 --> 18:51.901
Holy wall.

18:53.167 --> 18:54.577
You gave me that speech
at least four times

18:54.601 --> 18:56.467
before you left me for His Royal
Highness.

18:56.501 --> 18:57.901
He was great man.

18:58.601 --> 19:02.067
Well no doubt about it.
Warrior King.

19:02.834 --> 19:04.600
A lion among men.

19:05.501 --> 19:07.267
From the minute that royal fool
arrived,

19:07.300 --> 19:09.601
- I knew you'd leave me.
- How?

19:09.634 --> 19:12.067
He had that same mad look in
his eye.

19:13.267 --> 19:14.234
The same one you have when
there's even

19:14.267 --> 19:15.767
the slightest chance of danger.

19:15.801 --> 19:17.167
Hey, come on.

19:17.200 --> 19:19.167
- When did I give you that-
- Please.

19:19.200 --> 19:21.400
Every time you're up to your
neck in it.

19:21.434 --> 19:24.500
And I was there to pull you
out and patch you back up.

19:25.234 --> 19:27.100
This time he took you
somewhere I couldn't go.

19:27.133 --> 19:29.400
It was fine. I, I'm fine.

19:29.434 --> 19:30.534
I wasn't.

19:34.267 --> 19:35.534
So what do we do?

19:41.701 --> 19:43.200
You ever thought about
becoming a nun?

19:43.234 --> 19:44.234
I heard they're

19:44.267 --> 19:46.234
- crying out for them.
- Oh, really?

19:46.267 --> 19:47.734
Mm.

19:47.767 --> 19:53.067
Silk robes, and a wimple,
necklace.

19:53.767 --> 19:54.901
Was it bad?

19:56.234 --> 19:58.767
The biggest danger was dying
of boredom.

19:58.801 --> 20:01.100
Well, look, that's behind us
now.

20:01.133 --> 20:04.734
Listen, Marian, Richard gifted
me

20:04.767 --> 20:06.801
with land in France for my
service.

20:06.834 --> 20:08.334
We can build a house.

20:08.367 --> 20:12.433
We could buy pigs,
cattle, maybe some sheep.

20:13.234 --> 20:14.534
We could get married.

20:18.634 --> 20:21.267
The legend of Sherwood Forest,

20:21.300 --> 20:23.534
herding sheep and cattle.

20:23.567 --> 20:25.200
You'd be the worst farmer ever.

20:25.234 --> 20:27.367
Oh, the worst farm in the
west and in it together.

20:27.400 --> 20:29.767
- Yeah.
- It was truly meant to be.

20:31.167 --> 20:33.067
- You heard me, huh?
- I heard you.

20:34.400 --> 20:35.534
And?

20:42.267 --> 20:45.167
You really would make
the most beautiful nun.

20:45.200 --> 20:46.567
You should consider it.

21:18.234 --> 21:20.367
Little John came back with me
too.

21:20.400 --> 21:21.434
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

21:21.467 --> 21:24.534
Uh, he said he'd meet us
today up at the old cross.

21:25.133 --> 21:27.367
We're thinking of visiting
Alan-a-Dale

21:27.400 --> 21:28.777
up in the north riding for All
Soul's Day,

21:28.801 --> 21:33.067
and then maybe getting a boat
south.

21:35.167 --> 21:37.300
Well if we started up
there early this morning,

21:37.334 --> 21:39.534
we could make it there in good
time.

21:40.734 --> 21:42.534
I hear he's planning quite the
reception.

21:42.567 --> 21:45.034
I'd expect nothing less.

21:46.133 --> 21:47.767
It would be good to see him
again.

21:48.400 --> 21:50.534
So you'll come? To France?

21:52.501 --> 21:54.200
I don't know.

21:54.234 --> 21:56.067
What is there left for us here?

21:57.167 --> 21:59.367
Let's go to Alan's and find out.

21:59.400 --> 22:00.700
Find out what?

22:01.434 --> 22:02.734
See if things have changed.

22:02.767 --> 22:04.501
What things?

22:04.534 --> 22:05.534
Do you mean me?

22:07.200 --> 22:08.634
What?

22:08.667 --> 22:10.467
What was that?

22:11.300 --> 22:13.500
Outlaws, most likely.

22:14.367 --> 22:15.200
This place is crawling with
them.

22:15.234 --> 22:18.534
You're such an idiot.

22:18.567 --> 22:20.501
I need to clear my head.

22:20.534 --> 22:22.534
I'm gonna go down to the stream.

22:22.567 --> 22:24.834
Okay. I'll get out some food.

22:25.367 --> 22:27.433
Oh, bring back some water.

22:29.133 --> 22:30.400
Yes, sire.

24:05.567 --> 24:08.701
Robin!

25:18.434 --> 25:19.600
Robin.

26:27.501 --> 26:29.567
Soldier! Over here!

27:07.501 --> 27:11.467
- Come here!
- Uh, no!

27:11.501 --> 27:13.267
Get off me!

27:18.767 --> 27:20.567
Get off me!

27:24.701 --> 27:26.400
- Marian!
- Robin!

27:28.400 --> 27:30.167
Get off!

27:32.701 --> 27:34.667
Well, good rescue.

27:34.701 --> 27:36.834
Good escape.

27:37.868 --> 27:39.601
Where are we? Who are they?

27:39.634 --> 27:40.667
I'm not sure.

27:40.701 --> 27:42.834
Uh, maybe mercenaries.

27:42.868 --> 27:44.834
- We need to get out of here.
- How?

27:57.133 --> 27:59.033
Marian!

27:59.067 --> 28:00.367
Let her go!

28:01.534 --> 28:02.534
Shame.

28:05.701 --> 28:06.701
Bring her.

28:10.267 --> 28:11.434
No! No!

28:11.467 --> 28:12.667
- You'll regret!
- No!

28:12.701 --> 28:15.267
Girls are a lovely hunt!

28:15.300 --> 28:16.300
Hold her!

28:24.667 --> 28:25.967
Thank you, Guisborne.

28:29.667 --> 28:30.967
I'll deal with this.

28:35.200 --> 28:36.600
Sheriff De Wendenal,

28:37.367 --> 28:39.043
please, whatever you want,
just leave her alone.

28:39.067 --> 28:40.434
Sheriff?

28:40.467 --> 28:43.667
Gosh, it's been a long time
since anyone called me that.

28:43.701 --> 28:46.600
What do you want? Why have you
returned?

28:47.767 --> 28:50.600
Three years I lost to exile.

28:51.567 --> 28:53.267
I had everything.

28:53.300 --> 28:55.601
And then you and your
precious king took it from me.

28:55.634 --> 28:59.033
What we did was right to
take your title, De Wendenal.

28:59.067 --> 29:01.434
You reap the rewards
of your own corruption.

29:01.467 --> 29:04.667
Do you know when I was in exile,

29:04.701 --> 29:07.434
I was dogged by tales of Robin
hood.

29:07.467 --> 29:10.200
Every inn in every town.

29:10.234 --> 29:13.033
I thought that I would never
escape you.

29:13.067 --> 29:14.067
Until now.

29:15.467 --> 29:16.700
It's over.

29:17.267 --> 29:20.367
The legend of the bowman dies
today.

29:21.133 --> 29:22.433
Misfits Walter.

29:23.467 --> 29:27.067
Do you know, I did think
about letting her go before,

29:27.100 --> 29:31.333
but here she is, back again.

29:32.300 --> 29:34.734
You never did know when
to walk away, did you?

29:34.767 --> 29:36.467
Get it over with, William.

29:37.667 --> 29:39.967
I'm so sorry, Misfits Walter.

29:40.667 --> 29:43.133
It won't be over

29:43.167 --> 29:45.801
for a very long time.

29:45.834 --> 29:47.734
- Stay still, girl!
- Leave here!

29:49.434 --> 29:51.333
You can struggle all you like,

29:51.834 --> 29:54.267
but Robin hood is going to watch

29:54.300 --> 29:56.667
every single cut I make

29:56.701 --> 29:59.834
and listen to every single
scream.

30:05.834 --> 30:06.834
Guisborne!

30:06.868 --> 30:08.400
Duck!

30:08.434 --> 30:09.734
Whoa! Whoa!

30:13.868 --> 30:15.967
- You all right?
- Never better.

30:31.634 --> 30:32.834
Marian!

30:32.868 --> 30:34.001
- Uh!
- Robin!

30:42.667 --> 30:43.834
Get up! Get up!

30:49.133 --> 30:51.634
Well don't just stand there!
Get them!

30:51.667 --> 30:54.534
- Move, move!
- Go, go, go!

30:54.567 --> 30:57.033
After 'em, after 'em! Go, go!

31:22.067 --> 31:23.067
Just do it! Just do it!

31:35.400 --> 31:40.700
Go, go, go!

31:51.868 --> 31:53.300
Here!

31:58.267 --> 32:01.634
They must be close. Spread out.

32:01.667 --> 32:03.467
Search everywhere.

32:10.234 --> 32:11.801
Come on. Get up.

32:14.634 --> 32:19.934
- Over there.
- Okay.

32:39.234 --> 32:41.300
They must be around here
somewhere.

32:41.801 --> 32:43.300
Keep searching.

32:50.234 --> 32:51.300
- Sorry.
- How bad is it?

32:51.334 --> 32:53.567
- Oh!
- You know the answer.

32:56.434 --> 32:57.100
What's De Wendenal doing back?

32:57.133 --> 32:59.067
I thought Richard banished him.

32:59.100 --> 33:02.133
That means he must have got
back after the king's death.

33:02.167 --> 33:04.834
With Richard gone, who's
powerful enough to stop him?

33:09.834 --> 33:13.200
- We need to move fast.
- Look, we stick to the plan.

33:13.234 --> 33:14.601
We head east to the old cross

33:14.634 --> 33:16.501
and meet up with Little John.

33:16.534 --> 33:18.367
We can be at Alan's by the
solstice

33:18.400 --> 33:20.267
and in France in two weeks.

33:20.300 --> 33:21.634
He'll never find us.

33:31.200 --> 33:33.200
They're gaining on us.
They'll be here any minute.

33:33.234 --> 33:34.767
You have to go.

33:34.801 --> 33:37.133
- No, don't be stupid.
- They'll see us if we run.

33:37.167 --> 33:39.100
And I won't make it. Go!

33:39.133 --> 33:42.534
No! We go together or not at
all!

33:43.467 --> 33:45.767
- Take off your surcoat.
- Okay.

34:02.634 --> 34:04.567
You gonna tell me what you're
doing?

34:04.601 --> 34:06.500
- You're going for a run.
- Oh.

34:17.667 --> 34:19.600
- You ready?
- Always.

34:23.367 --> 34:24.500
There!

34:25.234 --> 34:27.133
Go!

34:40.133 --> 34:41.467
Find them.

34:43.234 --> 34:44.333
Find them!

35:01.434 --> 35:02.567
Wait.

35:03.601 --> 35:08.200
Wait.

35:08.234 --> 35:09.801
We need to stay off the main
road.

35:22.167 --> 35:23.901
- This way.
- Sir.

35:33.834 --> 35:35.400
Every time they run, they head
east.

35:35.434 --> 35:36.801
So?

35:36.834 --> 35:39.801
So, they're trying to throw us
off.

35:43.167 --> 35:46.001
Take two men. The rest of you on
me.

36:13.601 --> 36:15.300
Stand aside, friend.

36:18.300 --> 36:20.167
I said, stand aside.

36:20.200 --> 36:21.767
We have urgent business to take
care of

36:21.801 --> 36:23.433
and you are in our way.

36:26.834 --> 36:28.001
Go around him.

36:29.234 --> 36:31.567
- I don't think that's wise.
- He's one man.

36:31.601 --> 36:32.734
What can he do?

36:34.434 --> 36:37.467
This is your last chance,
friend.

36:38.834 --> 36:40.267
Take him down.

37:01.567 --> 37:03.534
- I need a minute.
- Are you all right?

37:03.567 --> 37:04.801
Yeah.

37:06.534 --> 37:08.234
- Hold it.
- What?

37:19.801 --> 37:21.467
You're late.

37:24.267 --> 37:27.334
Little John!

37:27.367 --> 37:29.534
What happened to him? He
looks like death warmed up.

37:29.567 --> 37:32.367
- We're in trouble.
- Less than you were.

37:32.400 --> 37:33.500
Here.

37:35.434 --> 37:38.100
- What happened?
- De Wendenal.

37:38.133 --> 37:39.100
- What?
- Apparently he holds

37:39.133 --> 37:40.501
a grudge.

37:40.534 --> 37:43.334
We need to move fast.
It's a long way to France.

37:43.367 --> 37:45.434
Oh, you'll never make it, old
friend.

37:45.467 --> 37:47.276
- Look at the state of you.
- We can't stay here.

37:47.300 --> 37:48.067
It's not safe.

37:48.100 --> 37:48.968
I don't think we have a choice.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.367
- He needs to rest.
- So what do we do?

37:54.501 --> 37:55.567
- Run!
- Guys, I find him!

37:55.601 --> 37:56.734
Come on!

38:01.400 --> 38:03.001
- Go!
- Come on!

38:11.367 --> 38:13.667
See you later, Marian.

38:48.434 --> 38:50.500
Put him on the bed.

38:59.133 --> 39:00.967
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

39:11.667 --> 39:14.667
- How are you feeling?
- Just look at me.

39:14.701 --> 39:16.234
I'm done.

39:16.267 --> 39:18.334
No, you just, you just need to
rest.

39:18.367 --> 39:20.400
What if they come for us?

39:20.434 --> 39:22.167
I can hardly raise my arm let
alone a bow.

39:22.200 --> 39:25.067
They won't. We're safe here.

39:25.100 --> 39:27.567
Oh God, we should have
gone three years ago

39:27.601 --> 39:29.667
when we had the chance.

39:30.567 --> 39:33.034
I should never have
left you for Jerusalem.

39:34.167 --> 39:36.867
You came back. And what I
wanted.

39:38.100 --> 39:40.067
You wanted a grateful pig
farmer.

39:41.334 --> 39:43.034
I guess that's what you've got.

39:44.234 --> 39:46.734
You should try and leave while
you still have the chance.

39:46.767 --> 39:48.967
I'll never leave you, Robin
Hood.

39:51.567 --> 39:53.100
Get some rest.

39:54.400 --> 39:57.867
Maybe tomorrow we'll find
a brighter disposition.

40:14.467 --> 40:16.501
We're in trouble.

40:16.534 --> 40:18.067
This place is well-hidden.

40:18.100 --> 40:18.934
They've never found me here
before.

40:18.968 --> 40:21.034
Yeah, you didn't see De
Wendenal.

40:21.567 --> 40:22.967
He's not gonna stop.

40:24.367 --> 40:25.200
We need to get down to the
Hughes.

40:25.234 --> 40:27.334
They'll patch us out on the next
ship.

40:27.367 --> 40:29.300
That's 20 miles. Maybe more.

40:29.334 --> 40:31.334
Robin's not even gonna make it
20 feet.

40:31.367 --> 40:33.300
We need to find a way.

40:33.334 --> 40:35.334
Can you get us a horse and cart?

40:35.367 --> 40:38.467
Maybe. My cousin owns
a farm down by the Lea.

40:38.501 --> 40:40.467
It's gonna be a few hours
though.

40:42.501 --> 40:44.101
I need to buy you some time.

40:45.467 --> 40:46.834
Go. Thank you.

41:40.300 --> 41:41.433
We lost him.

41:41.767 --> 41:43.400
Yes, I can see that.

41:45.367 --> 41:47.067
They had help. A big man.

41:47.100 --> 41:49.033
Another outlaw, I guess.

41:49.067 --> 41:50.168
John Little.

41:50.734 --> 41:52.334
Be thankful it didn't turn out
worse.

41:52.367 --> 41:53.567
Which way did they go?

41:53.601 --> 41:56.200
- East.
- To the river.

41:56.234 --> 41:57.400
Yes, sir.

41:58.400 --> 41:59.634
I'm sorry.

42:00.234 --> 42:01.543
They ambushed us. We didn't have
much-

42:01.567 --> 42:03.467
- Yes, I don't really care about
that.

42:03.501 --> 42:05.734
We just need more men
to get ready to march.

42:05.767 --> 42:08.667
So Fitz, fetch six men
and grab the throwers.

42:08.701 --> 42:10.300
Meet me by the high road.

42:10.334 --> 42:13.501
Ganger, just get everyone else.

42:13.534 --> 42:15.067
- Now!
- Yes, My Lord.

43:35.567 --> 43:37.634
I don't like this.

43:52.501 --> 43:54.467
Find him! Find him!

44:08.100 --> 44:10.167
There! Move, move!

44:13.133 --> 44:14.133
After her!

44:19.067 --> 44:20.067
Move.

44:30.133 --> 44:31.967
De Wendenal's gonna get us
killed.

44:36.067 --> 44:38.734
Uh!

44:38.767 --> 44:40.634
You all right, sir?

44:40.667 --> 44:43.801
Get me up here.

45:02.434 --> 45:05.001
Robin, where's Little John?

45:05.701 --> 45:08.534
Well, I dunno. I
thought he was with you.

45:08.567 --> 45:10.467
He went to his cousin's to get
a cart.

45:10.501 --> 45:12.333
I thought he'd be back by now.

45:13.467 --> 45:14.767
How are you feeling?

45:15.367 --> 45:16.667
Careful.

45:16.701 --> 45:18.176
Yeah, maybe I'll stay here for
a moment.

45:18.200 --> 45:20.634
Best not to rush.

45:20.667 --> 45:23.234
Agreed. I'll make you some food.

45:23.267 --> 45:25.801
It'll do you good. I'll make a
broth.

45:27.267 --> 45:28.400
Where were you?

45:29.501 --> 45:31.643
I went to see if I could
convince De Wendenal's soldiers

45:31.667 --> 45:34.200
- to leave us alone.
- And did he listen?

45:34.234 --> 45:35.967
I think he got the picture.

45:37.067 --> 45:38.477
With any luck, De
Wendenal will crawl back

45:38.501 --> 45:40.467
under his rock and give
us no more trouble.

45:40.501 --> 45:42.741
He should know better than
to venture into our territory.

45:47.501 --> 45:49.467
You hear that? It's Little John.

45:49.501 --> 45:50.534
Come on.

46:07.634 --> 46:08.734
John.

46:11.701 --> 46:12.701
I'm sorry.

46:14.868 --> 46:16.567
Run for it! Get inside!

46:37.834 --> 46:39.601
What now?

46:39.634 --> 46:40.734
I don't know.

46:42.334 --> 46:43.334
Robin Hood!

46:46.734 --> 46:48.434
Come out.

46:48.467 --> 46:50.001
I have you trapped.

46:50.734 --> 46:52.467
How did he find us?

46:52.501 --> 46:54.001
I have no idea.

46:54.667 --> 46:58.001
Don't try me, outlaw.
I am not a patient man.

46:58.868 --> 47:02.001
If you come out now, I'll kill
you quick.

47:03.434 --> 47:05.834
I might even let your lady go
free.

47:05.868 --> 47:07.667
Come and get us, De Wendenal!

47:11.133 --> 47:13.300
I was rather hoping you'd say
that.

47:14.801 --> 47:16.467
Bring up the throwers!

47:16.501 --> 47:19.033
- Move, move, move!
- Come on, let's go!

47:19.067 --> 47:20.467
Bloody set it down! Come on!

47:20.501 --> 47:21.667
Let's go, down! Good!

47:23.834 --> 47:26.133
- Come on, wind it!
- What's that?

47:26.167 --> 47:27.834
Nothing good.

47:27.868 --> 47:29.300
Come on, wind it!

47:30.767 --> 47:32.333
Ready to go!

47:33.267 --> 47:34.467
Guys go it?

47:35.133 --> 47:37.234
We need to run now.

47:37.267 --> 47:38.734
I can hardly stand.

47:38.767 --> 47:40.367
When you're ready, lads.

47:41.067 --> 47:42.067
Ready!

47:43.601 --> 47:44.801
Release!

47:46.434 --> 47:47.434
Get back!

47:52.834 --> 47:55.834
Release, Release, Release!

47:59.367 --> 48:00.434
You go.

48:00.467 --> 48:02.801
- Release!
- It's me they want.

48:02.834 --> 48:04.043
How many times before you
listen?

48:04.067 --> 48:05.200
I'm not leaving you.

48:05.234 --> 48:07.274
They'll advance over on
us while our heads are down.

48:08.634 --> 48:09.674
We need to slow them down.

48:09.701 --> 48:10.801
- Release!
- With what?

48:12.567 --> 48:13.567
Release!

48:16.067 --> 48:18.067
- I can get you out.
- What?

48:18.100 --> 48:19.167
How?

48:19.200 --> 48:20.400
- Release!
- Just trust me.

48:20.434 --> 48:21.767
I can buy you time.

48:21.801 --> 48:23.167
I'm not leaving you either.

48:23.200 --> 48:24.801
If we both leave, they'll
catch us both.

48:24.834 --> 48:26.701
No, they'll kill you.

48:26.734 --> 48:27.801
Yeah, kill me, maybe,

48:27.834 --> 48:29.567
kill you, definitely.

48:29.601 --> 48:32.634
Look, get out, get to the river,

48:32.667 --> 48:33.801
and get to a boat.

48:33.834 --> 48:36.267
I'll meet you at Tuck's.
And I'll marry you.

48:36.300 --> 48:37.434
Okay?

48:37.467 --> 48:40.801
Don't do anything foolish.

48:40.834 --> 48:41.667
I just said

48:41.701 --> 48:44.400
I'd marry you, didn't I?

48:47.868 --> 48:49.734
What's the fool doing?

48:50.434 --> 48:51.767
Stop her!

48:51.801 --> 48:53.801
- Reload!
- Shoot her down!

48:59.634 --> 49:00.801
For God's sake!

49:00.834 --> 49:04.767
Marian.

49:06.234 --> 49:07.234
Wait.

49:10.868 --> 49:12.567
- No!
- He's down!

49:12.601 --> 49:16.467
- Get after him!
- Go!

49:24.634 --> 49:25.767
Get up!

49:28.634 --> 49:32.100
Come on!

49:43.200 --> 49:44.300
Come on!

50:01.167 --> 50:03.501
- I'm all right.
- We need help.

50:03.534 --> 50:05.400
You leave, I'll follow.

50:05.434 --> 50:06.434
No, come on!

50:06.467 --> 50:09.601
Get up!

50:36.200 --> 50:37.300
Sister Agnes!

50:41.300 --> 50:43.367
Sister, please! He's dying!

50:43.400 --> 50:44.601
Whatever you've done, Matilda,

50:44.634 --> 50:46.133
you cannot bring it here!

50:46.167 --> 50:47.610
De Wendenal is back!
He's trying to kill us!

50:47.634 --> 50:49.634
The old sheriff, why?

50:49.667 --> 50:51.767
This is Robin Hood.

50:54.234 --> 50:55.600
Jesus, Matilda.

50:56.267 --> 50:57.767
You've just killed us all. Be
gone!

50:57.801 --> 51:00.601
No, you cannot refuse
us! It's your duty!

51:00.634 --> 51:02.767
You have to Grant us sanctuary!

51:06.767 --> 51:09.667
Sister Mary, prepare inside.

51:09.701 --> 51:11.734
Thank you.

51:13.634 --> 51:15.234
Clear the table.
Sister, clear the table.

51:18.634 --> 51:21.034
- Careful.
- Thank you, sister.

51:28.167 --> 51:29.167
Careful.

51:31.434 --> 51:33.767
Sister Mary, bring hot water.

51:33.801 --> 51:34.934
You're okay.

51:42.267 --> 51:43.734
We'll need to get it out.

51:44.767 --> 51:47.267
Matilda. What's going on?

51:47.300 --> 51:49.133
I don't even know where to
start.

51:49.167 --> 51:50.343
The young fool has brought
death to us.

51:50.367 --> 51:51.734
No!

51:51.767 --> 51:52.901
Sister?

51:54.133 --> 51:54.968
William De Wendenal is
hunting them and your prodigy

51:55.000 --> 51:57.267
has brought him straight to our
door.

51:57.300 --> 51:59.767
He's dying! I didn't
know where else to go!

51:59.801 --> 52:01.234
You did the right thing.

52:01.267 --> 52:02.376
We'll be gone as soon as we can.

52:02.400 --> 52:06.267
You won't be walking anywhere
for days. This won't do.

52:06.300 --> 52:09.200
If William really is
coming here, we need help.

52:09.234 --> 52:11.200
Matilda, De Lech, the new
sheriff,

52:11.234 --> 52:13.734
is hunting near here over by the
old kirk.

52:13.767 --> 52:15.367
He will have no quarrel with
Robin,

52:15.400 --> 52:17.334
and he was loyal to King
Richard.

52:17.367 --> 52:18.434
Find him.

52:18.467 --> 52:20.210
- He will know what to do.
- No, I'm not leaving Robin.

52:20.234 --> 52:22.067
There is no one else.

52:23.133 --> 52:25.567
I'll be okay. I'm in safe
hands now, go!

52:25.601 --> 52:28.234
- I'm not leaving you!
- I will look after him,

52:28.267 --> 52:31.133
Marian, I promise.

52:31.167 --> 52:36.467
I'll be okay.

53:29.567 --> 53:30.667
It is done.

53:31.367 --> 53:32.901
Well done, sister.

53:34.801 --> 53:36.601
I feel I've done more harm
than good.

53:36.634 --> 53:40.100
No one could have done
more. He's in God's hands now.

53:40.133 --> 53:41.367
Thank you, Lady Prioress.

53:41.400 --> 53:43.667
- You should rest now.
- I need to stitch

53:43.701 --> 53:44.601
the wound. Oh, sister.

53:44.634 --> 53:47.433
Mary will do it. She's good with
a needle.

53:48.133 --> 53:51.167
I shall watch over him.

53:51.200 --> 53:53.467
There's nothing more you can do,
Agnes.

53:54.100 --> 53:55.701
Call me if he worsens?

53:55.734 --> 54:00.801
Of course. Go now,
sister, with my blessing.

54:00.834 --> 54:02.167
Thank you, Elizabeth.

54:10.767 --> 54:15.067
I've never met an outlaw
before. Fascinating.

54:16.767 --> 54:19.467
Fetch needle and thread,
sister, quickly now.

54:34.400 --> 54:35.701
Prioress Elizabeth sent me!

54:35.734 --> 54:36.810
I need to speak to the sheriff!

54:36.834 --> 54:38.567
- He's resting.
- Then wake him!

54:38.601 --> 54:41.433
- This is important!
- He will not be disturbed.

54:42.501 --> 54:43.734
- Get off me!
- Step away!

54:43.767 --> 54:45.433
May I assist you, madam?

54:46.267 --> 54:47.367
Who are you?

54:47.400 --> 54:50.334
I'm Simon. I'm the warden here.

54:50.367 --> 54:52.133
I deal with matters whilst the
sheriff

54:52.167 --> 54:54.300
is otherwise indisposed.

54:54.334 --> 54:55.267
He's resting at the moment.

54:55.300 --> 54:57.901
A late lunch always
sends him off to sleep.

54:58.400 --> 55:00.334
Is there something you need?

55:00.367 --> 55:02.334
Prioress Elizabeth sent me.

55:02.367 --> 55:04.067
William De Wendenal is back.

55:04.100 --> 55:06.634
- He's trying to kill us.
- De Wendenal?

55:08.300 --> 55:09.433
Why?

55:10.234 --> 55:11.400
Who are you?

55:12.400 --> 55:14.034
I'm Marian Fitzwalter.

55:16.601 --> 55:19.534
A moment, please. I'll
wake the sheriff at once.

55:23.601 --> 55:25.734
De Wendenal is back.

55:32.567 --> 55:35.267
The exile De Wendenal is here?

55:35.300 --> 55:37.067
Yes. He attacked us.

55:37.100 --> 55:39.634
He's pursuing us. He intends to
kill us.

55:39.667 --> 55:41.067
Arrogant cur.

55:42.467 --> 55:45.334
I will string him up if I get
hold of him.

55:45.367 --> 55:47.433
My betrothed's life is in
danger.

55:48.367 --> 55:49.534
Your betrothed?

55:50.567 --> 55:52.700
Robert of Loxley.

55:55.367 --> 55:57.567
Robin Hood, the wolf's-head?

55:57.601 --> 55:59.700
- Yes, sir.
- Ah.

56:00.334 --> 56:02.867
Well, I can see why his
life might be in danger.

56:03.434 --> 56:05.634
De Wendenal has good cause to
hate him.

56:05.667 --> 56:09.334
He got what he deserved! Please.

56:09.367 --> 56:10.567
We took shelter at Kirklees's,

56:10.601 --> 56:13.534
but if he finds us, he'll kill
us.

56:13.567 --> 56:14.834
We need your help.

56:16.801 --> 56:18.501
Well, there are many
rich men around here

56:18.534 --> 56:20.734
who would gladly see Hood dead,

56:21.367 --> 56:24.367
but De Wendenal, he cannot be
permitted

56:24.400 --> 56:27.400
to flout the king's law as he
sees fit.

56:29.501 --> 56:31.067
We will help you.

56:31.100 --> 56:32.367
Thank you, sir.

56:32.400 --> 56:33.510
There are not many of us here,
madam,

56:33.534 --> 56:35.167
but we shall ride at once.

56:35.200 --> 56:35.901
- Thank you, sir.
- Guard?

56:35.934 --> 56:37.400
- What?
- Bring out the horses

56:37.434 --> 56:38.267
and ready my armour.

56:38.300 --> 56:39.200
- Simon?
- Yes, Lord?

56:39.234 --> 56:41.267
Send a rider to the nearest
Garrison.

56:41.300 --> 56:42.534
Bring troops to Kirklee...

56:42.567 --> 56:44.200
Uh!

57:40.100 --> 57:41.100
Stop!

58:01.667 --> 58:04.067
The soldiers are on their way.
Murderer!

58:04.100 --> 58:06.467
- I had no choice!
- What do you mean?

58:07.100 --> 58:08.467
They have my family.

58:09.234 --> 58:10.567
Who?

58:14.567 --> 58:16.367
What are you doing?

58:16.400 --> 58:18.100
I had no choice.

58:18.133 --> 58:20.067
What? No.

58:20.100 --> 58:22.600
Marian, what have you done?

58:23.634 --> 58:26.501
Guards, guards! I found the
assassin.

58:26.534 --> 58:28.767
- I didn't do anything.
- Quickly!

58:29.334 --> 58:30.667
I struck down her accomplice!

58:30.701 --> 58:33.033
They tried to kill me! I
tracked down her accomplice!

58:33.067 --> 58:35.467
Seize her! Seize her
before she kills again!

58:51.567 --> 58:53.700
This way! Over here!

59:55.534 --> 59:57.534
Come quickly! Something is
wrong!

59:57.567 --> 59:59.434
Where's Robin? Is he all right?

59:59.467 --> 1:00:00.643
I left him with Lady Elizabeth.

1:00:00.667 --> 1:00:02.143
She said you would watch
him, but now the door

1:00:02.167 --> 1:00:03.443
is locked and she doesn't
answer!

1:00:03.467 --> 1:00:05.567
Robin!

1:00:05.601 --> 1:00:08.067
- Why would she lock it?
- I, I don't know!

1:00:08.100 --> 1:00:09.734
Prioress!

1:00:09.767 --> 1:00:10.934
Elizabeth!

1:00:11.767 --> 1:00:12.934
Step back.

1:00:19.300 --> 1:00:21.067
Robin!

1:00:21.100 --> 1:00:22.567
We have to do something!

1:00:22.601 --> 1:00:24.434
I don't now. I'm afraid
it may be too late.

1:00:24.467 --> 1:00:26.501
- We have to try!
- I, I,

1:00:26.534 --> 1:00:28.034
I'll fetch my medicines.

1:00:28.567 --> 1:00:30.601
All right, hold on.

1:00:35.167 --> 1:00:38.400
Agnes!

1:00:39.367 --> 1:00:41.367
Whilst we are sinners,

1:00:41.400 --> 1:00:43.767
Christ died for us.

1:00:46.267 --> 1:00:48.434
You're a murderer!

1:00:48.467 --> 1:00:50.567
Sometimes, yes.

1:00:50.601 --> 1:00:52.667
Other times, I have help.

1:00:52.701 --> 1:00:54.834
Isn't that right, cousin
dearest?

1:00:57.601 --> 1:01:00.100
Elizabeth.

1:01:00.133 --> 1:01:02.467
- What are you doing?
- I could have pursued Robin

1:01:02.501 --> 1:01:04.133
all across the Holy Lands,

1:01:04.167 --> 1:01:07.400
but I thought it easier if
my cousin nurse made you

1:01:07.434 --> 1:01:09.467
for his inevitable return.

1:01:09.501 --> 1:01:12.801
Where else would the lovestruck
fool go when he came home?

1:01:13.567 --> 1:01:14.834
How could you?

1:01:14.868 --> 1:01:19.067
Blood is thicker than water,
Matilda.

1:01:19.100 --> 1:01:22.901
Robin humiliated my family.
He has to pay the price.

1:01:23.667 --> 1:01:25.367
Give me the sword, girl.

1:01:27.167 --> 1:01:28.634
Robin lost.

1:01:29.701 --> 1:01:30.867
It's over.

1:01:32.400 --> 1:01:33.601
Give me the sword.

1:01:39.667 --> 1:01:40.801
Such a shame.

1:01:41.667 --> 1:01:42.967
Take her away.

1:01:44.501 --> 1:01:45.667
William!

1:01:45.701 --> 1:01:47.834
It's just a scratch. Get after
her!

1:01:47.868 --> 1:01:50.834
You'll have to do better
than that, Marian!

1:01:50.868 --> 1:01:51.834
Kill her!

1:01:51.868 --> 1:01:53.434
Well let me fetch you bandages.

1:01:53.467 --> 1:01:55.601
No, it is done.

1:01:55.634 --> 1:01:56.667
I must go.

1:01:56.701 --> 1:01:58.501
What about Marian?

1:01:58.534 --> 1:02:01.701
Who cares about her? What
harm could she possibly do us?

1:02:01.734 --> 1:02:03.701
You have work to do.

1:02:03.734 --> 1:02:05.067
Of course, cousin.

1:03:38.267 --> 1:03:39.734
Who's there?

1:03:42.234 --> 1:03:43.767
Sister Matilda?

1:03:45.634 --> 1:03:46.934
Come, closer child.

1:03:47.868 --> 1:03:50.666
I assume you have good
reason to be abroad.

1:03:50.701 --> 1:03:53.834
Uh, Prioress Elizabeth
sent me to the, mm,

1:03:53.868 --> 1:03:55.834
for the justice, I am...

1:03:56.834 --> 1:03:59.101
I lost my way. Forgive my
appearance.

1:03:59.834 --> 1:04:01.267
I'm glad to have found you.

1:04:01.300 --> 1:04:04.033
And you haven't been back to
the priory?

1:04:04.067 --> 1:04:05.067
I haven't.

1:04:06.667 --> 1:04:08.534
That's probably for the best.

1:04:09.133 --> 1:04:10.734
What happen?

1:04:12.067 --> 1:04:13.067
Nevermind.

1:04:14.334 --> 1:04:16.234
Lady Elizabeth should know
better

1:04:16.267 --> 1:04:19.300
than to send a new visit
on official business.

1:04:20.834 --> 1:04:24.567
Well these are difficult times.

1:04:25.133 --> 1:04:26.400
They are, father?

1:04:29.267 --> 1:04:31.101
Forgive my intuition, but

1:04:32.634 --> 1:04:34.634
might I have some of your food?

1:04:34.667 --> 1:04:37.001
Yes, if you insist.

1:04:38.100 --> 1:04:39.500
Thank you.

1:04:41.267 --> 1:04:43.734
- Brother Common?
- Yes, father?

1:04:49.767 --> 1:04:52.300
Meat and drink for the sister,
Common.

1:04:53.501 --> 1:04:54.634
Yes, father.

1:04:57.701 --> 1:05:00.801
Brother Common at your service.

1:05:02.434 --> 1:05:04.034
Uh, Sister...

1:05:04.634 --> 1:05:05.767
Matilda.

1:05:10.234 --> 1:05:12.367
Sorry, I had a hard journey.

1:05:12.400 --> 1:05:13.967
My provisions were stolen.

1:05:14.801 --> 1:05:16.300
You must join us.

1:05:16.334 --> 1:05:17.801
We've business in the morning,

1:05:17.834 --> 1:05:20.400
but once it's done, we
would gladly accompany you

1:05:20.434 --> 1:05:21.834
wherever you wish to go.

1:05:21.868 --> 1:05:23.467
Thank you, brother.

1:05:23.501 --> 1:05:26.967
Brother Common is
misguided in his promise.

1:05:28.567 --> 1:05:30.067
We have much work to do,

1:05:31.467 --> 1:05:34.167
and we can't waste time
mending your mistakes.

1:05:37.834 --> 1:05:40.934
Brother, I need to prepare
my readings for the ceremony.

1:05:41.534 --> 1:05:43.300
You will see the sister fed,

1:05:43.801 --> 1:05:45.767
and then you will guide
her to the high road.

1:05:45.801 --> 1:05:48.200
But father, surely it's
dangerous

1:05:48.234 --> 1:05:50.200
for a lady to be alone on the
road.

1:05:50.234 --> 1:05:52.267
If she wishes for our help,

1:05:52.300 --> 1:05:55.200
do not permit a woman
to exercise authority

1:05:55.234 --> 1:05:57.101
over a man, brother.

1:05:58.667 --> 1:06:00.667
We have great works ahead.

1:06:01.501 --> 1:06:04.333
You'll have to find your
own path home, sister.

1:06:07.667 --> 1:06:09.300
My apologies, sister.

1:06:09.334 --> 1:06:11.701
The Abbott has much to contend
with.

1:06:11.734 --> 1:06:14.934
No matter. I'm grateful
for Your Grace's kindness.

1:06:17.634 --> 1:06:19.433
Tuck, what are you doing here?

1:06:20.667 --> 1:06:22.367
Robin's been captured.

1:06:23.334 --> 1:06:25.400
- Robin is dead.
- What?

1:06:26.634 --> 1:06:29.601
De Wendenal killed him.

1:06:29.634 --> 1:06:31.434
Uh, are you sure?

1:06:31.467 --> 1:06:33.434
A messenger came to the Abbey,

1:06:33.467 --> 1:06:35.300
hailing De Wendenal as a hero.

1:06:35.334 --> 1:06:38.667
He tracked Robin and
trapped him at Kirklees's.

1:06:38.701 --> 1:06:40.334
They claim he killed one of the
sisters.

1:06:40.367 --> 1:06:42.801
No, De Wendenal attacked us

1:06:43.601 --> 1:06:46.034
and slew Lady Agnes in cold
blood.

1:06:46.734 --> 1:06:49.100
Robin is alive. I'm certain.

1:06:49.133 --> 1:06:52.534
No, I saw him with my own eyes.

1:06:54.300 --> 1:06:56.200
There was no life in him.

1:06:56.234 --> 1:06:57.534
You are mistaken.

1:06:59.267 --> 1:07:04.567
Marian, they're going to
execute him tomorrow at dawn.

1:07:05.868 --> 1:07:08.501
- Execute him?
- Yes.

1:07:08.534 --> 1:07:09.700
And John.

1:07:11.734 --> 1:07:15.300
What, what have I done?

1:07:16.267 --> 1:07:17.577
I shouldn't have ever left him,
I-

1:07:17.601 --> 1:07:20.901
- There, there was nothing you
could do.

1:07:24.601 --> 1:07:26.567
Where, where are we?

1:07:26.601 --> 1:07:29.601
Uh, near Ashgate, maybe five
miles.

1:07:29.634 --> 1:07:31.634
Ashgate. By the ruins.

1:07:31.667 --> 1:07:32.834
Yes, yes.

1:07:34.200 --> 1:07:37.067
There's enough armour
buried there for small army.

1:07:37.100 --> 1:07:39.434
Alan in isn't far from
here. And Will Scarlett.

1:07:39.467 --> 1:07:41.434
If we go, we can do
this, we can, we can go-

1:07:41.467 --> 1:07:44.067
- Marian, you'll never make it.

1:07:44.100 --> 1:07:46.101
It's pitch dark.

1:07:48.100 --> 1:07:50.801
Just wait for me by the high
road,

1:07:50.834 --> 1:07:53.534
and I will come and
find you when it's done.

1:07:53.567 --> 1:07:56.167
- It's, it's over.
- I'm not giving up on him.

1:07:56.200 --> 1:07:58.901
Marian, we'll be killed.

1:07:59.601 --> 1:08:01.634
What could a fat old man and a
girl

1:08:01.667 --> 1:08:04.167
do against a private army?

1:08:04.200 --> 1:08:07.433
The only thing we can do, try.

1:08:08.734 --> 1:08:09.767
Marian!

1:09:39.267 --> 1:09:41.334
All quiet, Ganger?

1:09:41.367 --> 1:09:42.467
Yes, sir.

1:09:43.200 --> 1:09:44.433
Stay vigilant.

1:09:45.067 --> 1:09:47.500
This won't take long. Then we'll
move out.

1:09:56.501 --> 1:09:57.801
It's healing well.

1:09:59.267 --> 1:10:00.567
Thanks to your skill.

1:10:01.267 --> 1:10:03.100
Is all prepared?

1:10:03.133 --> 1:10:06.433
The barons are compliant.
They will follow the money.

1:10:06.767 --> 1:10:10.267
As always. And the Abbot?

1:10:10.300 --> 1:10:12.667
Eustace has been reminded of
the damage

1:10:12.701 --> 1:10:15.300
he would suffer should
word of his indiscretions

1:10:15.334 --> 1:10:17.400
reach the senate.

1:10:17.434 --> 1:10:21.433
And I am assured the final
piece is on its way now.

1:10:22.133 --> 1:10:23.734
You've done well, Elizabeth.

1:10:27.267 --> 1:10:28.267
Come!

1:10:32.367 --> 1:10:34.567
Speak of the devil and he
shall appear.

1:10:35.334 --> 1:10:38.100
Simon. Good of you to join us.

1:10:38.133 --> 1:10:40.901
I would not miss this
day for anything, My Lord.

1:10:42.234 --> 1:10:43.334
Do you have it?

1:10:43.367 --> 1:10:46.200
Of course, as agreed.

1:10:54.767 --> 1:10:58.334
And with this, the
undertaking is complete.

1:10:58.367 --> 1:11:01.567
Save one thing, dearest cousin.

1:11:01.601 --> 1:11:03.767
Hmm, indeed.

1:11:13.734 --> 1:11:16.634
Welcome, Abbot Eustace.

1:11:16.667 --> 1:11:19.334
I thank you for answering our
call.

1:11:19.367 --> 1:11:21.567
It is a privilege,
Prioress, to bear witness

1:11:21.601 --> 1:11:24.101
to an event of such import.

1:11:25.367 --> 1:11:27.567
My lords and ladies.

1:11:28.434 --> 1:11:30.534
We are gathered together to bear
witness

1:11:30.567 --> 1:11:34.300
to the rebirth of my family's
honour.

1:11:35.634 --> 1:11:39.867
Once the deed is done,
we make for Nottingham,

1:11:40.601 --> 1:11:44.433
where my cousin will reward
you well for your loyalty.

1:11:45.100 --> 1:11:48.667
Perhaps a few words for
your honoured guests, sheriff?

1:11:49.667 --> 1:11:51.701
Let's just get this over with.

1:11:51.734 --> 1:11:53.867
I have scores to settle in
Nottingham.

1:11:54.734 --> 1:11:56.300
Of course, cousin.

1:12:00.434 --> 1:12:01.667
Guisborne.

1:12:28.200 --> 1:12:30.101
Your skills are indeed
remarkable.

1:12:34.400 --> 1:12:39.267
Robin, gladdens my heart
to see you on your feet.

1:12:39.300 --> 1:12:42.300
William, it sickens mine to
see you

1:12:42.334 --> 1:12:43.934
still standing on yours.

1:13:11.100 --> 1:13:13.101
See you in the next life,
old friend.

1:13:27.567 --> 1:13:32.334
I spent every day of my
exile contemplating your death.

1:13:32.367 --> 1:13:35.701
I had dreams that I pursued
you to the ends of the earth

1:13:35.734 --> 1:13:39.534
and tortured you in a
hundred different ways.

1:13:39.567 --> 1:13:41.434
But now that you're here,

1:13:41.467 --> 1:13:45.367
I realise that all I want is you
gone.

1:13:45.400 --> 1:13:48.501
Your precious king is dead.

1:13:48.534 --> 1:13:51.200
And in a moment, you will be
too.

1:13:51.234 --> 1:13:54.467
And I will be free to do
whatever I want.

1:13:54.501 --> 1:13:56.501
Have you thought of becoming a
nun?

1:13:56.534 --> 1:13:58.634
Such a fool.

1:14:33.067 --> 1:14:34.067
Just do it.

1:14:54.601 --> 1:14:55.734
Cut her down!

1:14:57.501 --> 1:14:59.667
We have to help her!

1:15:13.334 --> 1:15:15.701
Don't forget the task in hand,
cousin.

1:15:15.734 --> 1:15:17.501
Robin Hood must die.

1:15:20.133 --> 1:15:21.701
Too late, Wolf's-head!

1:15:21.734 --> 1:15:23.701
The legend of the Bowman dies
today.

1:15:23.734 --> 1:15:25.467
No!

1:15:25.501 --> 1:15:28.501
Yes!

1:15:28.534 --> 1:15:30.067
Stay down, little man!

1:15:53.067 --> 1:15:54.667
If my cousin can't do the deed,

1:15:54.701 --> 1:15:57.367
I'll deal with you myself!

1:16:14.534 --> 1:16:16.534
- I thought I'd lost you.
- Huh, I'm good.

1:16:16.567 --> 1:16:18.501
Where's De Wendenal?

1:16:18.534 --> 1:16:20.133
He went that way.

1:16:20.167 --> 1:16:23.267
Marian don't. Just let him go.

1:16:23.300 --> 1:16:24.634
This ends today.

1:16:27.300 --> 1:16:29.234
Right, let's go.

1:16:29.267 --> 1:16:30.400
Yes.

1:16:48.601 --> 1:16:49.867
De Wendenal!

1:17:26.100 --> 1:17:28.701
You never learned to walk
away. Did you?

1:17:28.734 --> 1:17:31.267
Nottingham is mine.

1:17:31.300 --> 1:17:34.667
Your star is on the wane and
mine is in the ascendant!

1:17:34.701 --> 1:17:36.934
The Bowman is finished!

1:17:38.334 --> 1:17:41.967
It's so pathetic what some
people do in the name of love,

1:17:42.701 --> 1:17:45.133
but that is the weakness of your
sex.

1:17:45.167 --> 1:17:48.133
And that is why you will die.

1:17:54.100 --> 1:17:57.634
Think on this in your prison
cell.

1:17:58.234 --> 1:18:02.667
Everywhere I go, every inn,
every town,

1:18:02.701 --> 1:18:05.167
I will tell of story of Robin
Hood.

1:18:05.200 --> 1:18:07.467
Everyone will know the
legend of the Bowman

1:18:07.501 --> 1:18:10.667
and you'll hear his name every
day

1:18:10.701 --> 1:18:13.034
until the day you die.

1:18:14.467 --> 1:18:15.600
Marian!

1:18:44.701 --> 1:18:47.001
Oh, oh, you're okay.

1:18:47.667 --> 1:18:49.567
- Yeah.
- You're...

1:18:51.067 --> 1:18:52.334
Are you okay?

1:19:07.767 --> 1:19:09.634
So what do we do?

1:19:09.667 --> 1:19:11.400
Look for trouble?

1:19:33.501 --> 1:19:34.667
King John.

1:19:44.467 --> 1:19:45.600
Well?

1:19:52.868 --> 1:19:54.534
De Wendenal is dead.

1:20:00.434 --> 1:20:01.734
Hood killed him?

1:20:01.767 --> 1:20:04.534
No, sir. Marian.

1:20:13.234 --> 1:20:16.801
Assemble the men, sheriff.

1:20:18.868 --> 1:20:21.033
We ride to Nottingham.
