00:09.384 --> 00:12.429
[Nightwing breathing heavily]

00:12.512 --> 00:13.847
[Beast Boy]
Is she gonna be okay?

00:13.930 --> 00:15.765
[Nightwing]
Her heartbeat's steady.

00:15.849 --> 00:18.184
Rachel, can you hear me?

00:18.268 --> 00:19.519
[Starfire] She's so cold.

00:21.187 --> 00:22.063
[gasps]

00:23.314 --> 00:24.274
[breathing heavily]

00:24.357 --> 00:25.275
What happened?

00:25.358 --> 00:26.484
[Nightwing] We were attacked.

00:26.568 --> 00:28.278
You got hit pretty bad.

00:28.361 --> 00:29.279
Are you okay?

00:30.572 --> 00:31.489
No.

00:34.909 --> 00:36.035
I can't feel you.

00:45.587 --> 00:47.005
[Jo] So, tonight's
the big night.

00:47.088 --> 00:49.466
[Lamar] I got the ring.
All I need now is a yes.

00:49.549 --> 00:50.800
[Jo] If she doesn't say yes,

00:50.884 --> 00:52.427
I'll make a voodoo doll
and stick pins

00:52.510 --> 00:54.220
-in her for all eternity.
-[laughs]

00:55.138 --> 00:56.890
[sighs] Hold on.

00:57.557 --> 00:58.391
[grunts]

01:03.521 --> 01:05.899
[eerie music playing]

01:05.982 --> 01:07.108
[chittering]

01:10.069 --> 01:10.987
[groans]

01:12.530 --> 01:13.448
[choking]

01:13.531 --> 01:15.575
[coughing]

01:21.247 --> 01:22.332
Lamar?

01:27.003 --> 01:27.837
Lamar.

01:30.673 --> 01:32.008
[squelching]

01:32.091 --> 01:32.926
[grunting]

01:35.303 --> 01:36.888
[eerie music continues playing]

01:38.598 --> 01:39.474
[coughing]

01:40.308 --> 01:42.393
[squelching]

01:43.311 --> 01:44.437
[groans]

02:03.289 --> 02:04.332
[warbling]

02:06.292 --> 02:07.252
We have the blood.

02:08.503 --> 02:10.421
And I have something
even more valuable.

02:13.007 --> 02:15.468
The heretic is without
her power.

02:15.552 --> 02:17.720
It was never hers
to begin with.

02:17.804 --> 02:19.722
She had no right to it.

02:19.806 --> 02:21.391
You shouldn't have
brought it here.

02:21.474 --> 02:24.978
Now is not the time
for worry or doubt.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.984
Powers backward demands.

02:36.281 --> 02:37.115
[grunts]

02:38.408 --> 02:39.284
[chuckles]

02:41.119 --> 02:42.036
You're right.

02:43.705 --> 02:44.789
You always are.

02:46.082 --> 02:49.544
Tonight we shall
take back what's ours.

02:49.627 --> 02:51.421
After that,
nothing else matters.

02:53.047 --> 02:55.133
[theme music playing]

03:07.687 --> 03:09.105
[Dick] You sure you're okay?

03:09.188 --> 03:12.734
Yeah, I just... I feel empty.

03:12.817 --> 03:15.028
Like there's something,
you know...

03:15.111 --> 03:16.529
missing.

03:16.613 --> 03:19.240
But it... it's so big that
I can't feel it all at once.

03:19.324 --> 03:21.784
I want you to rest. Okay?

03:21.868 --> 03:23.453
We don't know what happened
to you, and until we do--

03:23.536 --> 03:24.662
It's my soul-self.

03:25.455 --> 03:26.915
It's just gone.

03:26.998 --> 03:29.208
How can your soul be gone?

03:30.168 --> 03:31.544
[Conner] Who the hell was that?

03:31.628 --> 03:33.588
She just took us all out.

03:33.671 --> 03:35.465
It's like, we didn't
stand a chance.

03:35.548 --> 03:38.635
Look, we're all here, okay?
We're all alive.

03:38.718 --> 03:40.136
That's all that matters.

03:40.219 --> 03:41.721
Somehow, what Kory
did drove her off,

03:41.804 --> 03:43.473
which means
she's not invincible.

03:43.556 --> 03:44.849
We're gonna find
out who she is,

03:44.933 --> 03:47.602
how she fights,
what her powers are.

03:47.685 --> 03:49.520
The next time we see her,
we're gonna be ready.

03:50.355 --> 03:51.230
[sighs]

03:52.148 --> 03:53.107
Gar, stay here.

03:53.191 --> 03:54.525
Keep an eye on Rachel.

03:54.609 --> 03:56.277
Tim, I want you back
at S.T.A.R. Labs.

03:56.778 --> 03:58.196
Why?

03:58.279 --> 04:00.156
'Cause you almost
died last night.
I can't risk losing you.

04:00.239 --> 04:02.492
So... I'm off the team?

04:02.575 --> 04:04.994
No. You start your
Robin training today.

04:05.078 --> 04:07.163
You're gonna finally learn
how to use that Bo staff.

04:08.373 --> 04:09.666
Okay. [laughs]

04:09.749 --> 04:11.501
Kory and I have
an errand to run.

04:11.584 --> 04:13.002
We do?

04:13.086 --> 04:16.255
We're gonna go meet someone.
Someone who can help us.

04:21.594 --> 04:22.470
Dick, wait.

04:23.638 --> 04:24.847
She, uh...

04:24.931 --> 04:26.349
She caught me off guard.

04:26.432 --> 04:29.727
Next time I'll be faster.
I, uh... [inhales deeply]

04:29.811 --> 04:31.437
I know there's a way
I can beat her.

04:31.521 --> 04:32.897
Don't take this on by yourself.

04:32.981 --> 04:34.440
We're a team.
We do it together.

04:40.697 --> 04:41.698
[door closes]

04:49.622 --> 04:51.499
[somber music playing]

05:11.811 --> 05:14.022
[cell phone ringing]

05:23.197 --> 05:24.407
Hello.

05:24.490 --> 05:26.868
Sebastian.
Derek Sands at Bixel.

05:26.951 --> 05:28.202
You ready to change your life?

05:29.037 --> 05:30.163
I'm sorry. What?

05:30.246 --> 05:31.497
Your video game.

05:31.581 --> 05:34.042
My team
and I have reconsidered.

05:34.125 --> 05:35.585
We'd like to buy it.

05:35.668 --> 05:36.502
Seriously?

05:37.754 --> 05:40.923
Um... I mean, that's...
that's great.

05:41.007 --> 05:42.258
[in Derek's voice]
I need you to come in

05:42.341 --> 05:44.052
so we can talk next steps.

05:44.135 --> 05:45.511
Can you meet me this afternoon?

05:45.595 --> 05:48.222
[Sebastian] Yeah.
Yeah, of course.

05:48.306 --> 05:50.224
Great. I'll see you then.

05:53.019 --> 05:54.979
[Kory] So are you gonna
tell me why we're here?

05:55.063 --> 05:56.606
[Dick] Didn't wanna say
anything back there,

05:56.689 --> 05:58.733
but what happened
to Rachel scares me.

05:58.816 --> 06:00.443
We're dealing with
the supernatural.

06:00.526 --> 06:02.320
That's just not something
I know a lot about.

06:03.196 --> 06:04.822
[indistinct chatter]

06:04.906 --> 06:06.574
Without Rachel,
we're gonna need someone

06:06.657 --> 06:09.202
who knows this stuff,
knows the players.

06:09.285 --> 06:11.370
[electronic music playing]

06:13.122 --> 06:16.793
There's a woman
I knew back in Gotham.
Her name's Jinx.

06:16.876 --> 06:19.003
She's a thief and a grifter.

06:19.087 --> 06:21.672
[Kory] And this is the person
we're going to for help?

06:21.756 --> 06:23.341
[Dick] She travels
in those circles.

06:23.424 --> 06:25.718
She might be able to tell us
who hit us last night.

06:29.388 --> 06:30.389
She looks harmless.

06:32.433 --> 06:33.392
Yeah, I know.

06:35.770 --> 06:37.355
I felt something in my shoe.

06:38.940 --> 06:40.608
You ever let her
out of her cell?

06:40.691 --> 06:43.111
No. She's been in solitary
since she got here.

06:44.112 --> 06:45.071
Open the gate.

06:46.989 --> 06:48.533
[gate buzzing]

06:50.326 --> 06:51.536
Oh, shit.

06:51.619 --> 06:53.579
-What's wrong?
-Stop.

06:53.663 --> 06:56.207
Stop! Don't let her foot
hit the ground.

07:01.254 --> 07:02.713
[wind blowing]

07:09.137 --> 07:10.179
[grunts]

07:20.439 --> 07:21.315
[sighs]

07:21.399 --> 07:22.608
[Kory] So now what?

07:22.692 --> 07:24.402
We're chasing down
a human tornado?

07:24.485 --> 07:26.028
Jinx got nailed
for trying to steal

07:26.112 --> 07:28.030
a high value artifact
from a dealer in Bludhaven.

07:28.114 --> 07:29.699
Right, a thief. You said that.

07:29.782 --> 07:32.368
As it turns out,
there's an auction
in Geneva next week.

07:32.451 --> 07:36.080
The dealer is transporting
his entire inventory
this weekend.

07:36.164 --> 07:37.707
Returning to the scene
of a crime.

07:38.374 --> 07:39.625
It's bold.

07:39.709 --> 07:42.086
Well, if there's
money to be made,

07:42.170 --> 07:43.588
that's where
we're gonna find Jinx.

07:52.388 --> 07:53.347
[sniffs]

07:53.431 --> 07:54.682
Oh, my God.

07:55.975 --> 07:57.935
Is everything okay
with the pancake?

07:58.019 --> 07:59.437
Yeah, they smell amazing.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.397
-I'm ready to start.
-[laughs]

08:01.480 --> 08:02.315
Thank you.

08:03.107 --> 08:04.275
I'm kind of starving.

08:04.358 --> 08:05.943
So I guess
you're feeling better.

08:06.819 --> 08:07.820
Oh, yeah.

08:08.821 --> 08:11.073
Yeah, 'cause...

08:11.157 --> 08:14.827
At first I was feeling empty,
but now I just feel...

08:15.786 --> 08:16.621
light.

08:17.413 --> 08:19.415
Like... [sniffs]

08:19.498 --> 08:21.834
I'm smelling this maple syrup.

08:21.918 --> 08:23.419
[sniffs deeply]

08:23.502 --> 08:24.629
And I-- I'm just...

08:25.671 --> 08:28.132
smelling this maple syrup,

08:28.216 --> 08:30.551
without the pain of everyone,

08:30.635 --> 08:33.262
like, flowing through me,
all the time.

08:33.346 --> 08:34.430
It's...

08:35.514 --> 08:38.142
Is this what life
is like for you?

08:38.226 --> 08:39.977
Without having
people's troubles,
just like,

08:40.061 --> 08:42.563
brushing through you
every second of every day?

08:43.898 --> 08:45.316
I wouldn't know.
[chuckles softly]

08:45.399 --> 08:46.859
Oh, my God.

08:46.943 --> 08:48.319
But I guess so, yeah.

08:49.487 --> 08:51.280
I think I like it.

08:51.364 --> 08:52.490
Is that a terrible
thing to say?

08:54.200 --> 08:56.035
Why is that a terrible thing?

08:56.118 --> 08:57.620
I don't know. I just feel like,

08:57.703 --> 09:00.081
I've got a responsibility,
as, like, a Titan.

09:01.290 --> 09:02.625
I... [sighs]

09:02.708 --> 09:04.210
But this is what living
a normal life is like.

09:04.293 --> 09:05.336
Oh, God.

09:06.879 --> 09:08.130
Is it your responsibility

09:08.214 --> 09:09.715
if it wasn't your
choice to begin with?

09:10.758 --> 09:11.717
I don't know.

09:12.218 --> 09:13.135
Isn't it?

09:19.725 --> 09:21.185
[distorted voices]

09:23.646 --> 09:24.647
[Rachel] What's wrong?

09:25.940 --> 09:27.191
Gar, what...

09:29.402 --> 09:31.112
[tense music playing]

09:53.676 --> 09:54.510
[sighs]

09:57.179 --> 09:58.597
[inhales deeply]

10:00.474 --> 10:01.809
[Rachel] My chef ghosted me.

10:02.852 --> 10:03.811
Sorry.

10:04.854 --> 10:06.856
-Needed a break.
-[chuckles]

10:08.441 --> 10:10.526
You know, I... I didn't mean
to say that, like,

10:10.609 --> 10:12.862
it was your responsibility
to be a Titan.

10:12.945 --> 10:14.363
Because I know you
didn't choose this,

10:14.447 --> 10:16.365
and Niles, that whole mess.

10:16.449 --> 10:17.783
It's okay, I'm past all that.

10:19.285 --> 10:20.244
This is my life.

10:22.163 --> 10:24.248
I just wanna take charge of it.

10:24.332 --> 10:26.417
Like, your transformations?

10:26.500 --> 10:29.378
-I... I thought that
you already--
-No, there's something else.

10:30.463 --> 10:31.881
Ever since
we got to Metropolis,

10:31.964 --> 10:34.884
strange things have
been happening to me.

10:34.967 --> 10:37.428
Stranger than being
blasted blonde?

10:37.511 --> 10:38.387
[chuckles]

10:39.305 --> 10:41.223
[chuckling] No?

10:43.225 --> 10:45.478
At first I thought they
were just hallucinations.

10:47.313 --> 10:50.441
I would get flashes
of this weird place.

10:51.734 --> 10:54.487
I'm in a world surrounded
by red, and I...

10:57.615 --> 10:59.575
Then yesterday,

10:59.658 --> 11:01.786
before the attack,
in the woods, I...

11:01.869 --> 11:02.828
heard voices.

11:04.705 --> 11:05.998
They called me "skinwalker",

11:08.000 --> 11:10.252
and they kept
saying, "Join us."

11:10.336 --> 11:11.212
Join who?

11:12.463 --> 11:13.422
I don't know.

11:14.840 --> 11:18.511
But in Navajo culture,
skinwalkers are shape shifters

11:18.594 --> 11:19.804
that can change into animals.

11:19.887 --> 11:21.430
So I...

11:21.514 --> 11:23.057
Oh, so you think
this is a connection
to your animal side.

11:24.433 --> 11:25.851
And...

11:25.935 --> 11:28.062
I think they're trying to tell
me something about her.

11:29.105 --> 11:29.980
Her?

11:30.064 --> 11:31.315
The witch that attacked us.

11:32.525 --> 11:33.943
Weird.

11:34.026 --> 11:36.278
If I can just get them
to talk to me again.

11:37.738 --> 11:39.407
Maybe they could
help us take her down.

11:41.325 --> 11:42.743
Oh.

11:42.827 --> 11:44.120
Okay, wait. Hold on.

11:49.333 --> 11:51.252
[drums beating]

11:56.674 --> 11:57.716
[staff clinks]

11:59.176 --> 12:00.511
[grunts]

12:02.972 --> 12:04.890
[grunting]

12:13.482 --> 12:16.110
I'm supposed to
fight back or...

12:16.193 --> 12:19.155
No, just let him
tire himself out.

12:19.238 --> 12:20.823
Then we can actually
get started.

12:23.951 --> 12:24.827
[mouthing] Okay.

12:27.621 --> 12:30.291
[grunting]

12:30.374 --> 12:34.336
They're just crash pads,
sensors that connect
to the VR simulator.

12:34.420 --> 12:37.339
They're just gonna make
sparring with your opponents
a little more...

12:38.132 --> 12:39.175
realistic.

12:39.258 --> 12:40.301
Meaning I'll feel the hits.

12:41.260 --> 12:42.678
Seriously?

12:42.761 --> 12:44.513
You're scared of a little pain?

12:44.597 --> 12:47.183
-I'm not scared.
-[chuckles] Yeah, you are.

12:47.266 --> 12:49.226
-[heart thumping]
-Your heart rate's 174...

12:49.977 --> 12:50.936
Oh, 178.

12:51.020 --> 12:52.855
-I...
-Tim, relax.

12:52.938 --> 12:55.149
Conner, stop looking
inside of people.

12:55.232 --> 12:57.401
He's no help to the team
if he can't suck it up.

12:57.485 --> 12:59.403
Hey, don't put your shit on me.

12:59.487 --> 13:00.529
You're the one that freaked out

13:00.613 --> 13:01.947
about not taking
down that witch.

13:02.031 --> 13:03.365
Boys.

13:03.449 --> 13:06.368
There was a break in
at the MPD evidence warehouse.

13:06.452 --> 13:08.120
And two people are dead.

13:08.204 --> 13:09.497
What got stolen?

13:09.580 --> 13:10.915
[Bernard]
Forty gallons of blood.

13:15.794 --> 13:17.296
[sirens wailing]

13:29.725 --> 13:30.809
You've upped your game.

13:32.603 --> 13:34.104
[exhales] Okay.

13:50.829 --> 13:52.206
Still got the moves.

14:01.131 --> 14:02.341
[door hissing]

14:21.777 --> 14:23.237
I got some moves, too.

14:23.904 --> 14:25.406
Who invited you?

14:26.282 --> 14:28.951
And... whoever she is.

14:29.034 --> 14:32.204
Koriand'r, this is Jinx.
Jinx, Kory.

14:32.288 --> 14:34.623
We're here
because we need
your help.

14:34.707 --> 14:36.083
And this is payment
if you accept.

14:36.166 --> 14:39.003
Dick Grayson,
deal maker extraordinaire.

14:39.086 --> 14:41.255
-[chuckles] Hard Pass.
-[Dick] You sure?

14:41.338 --> 14:42.840
It must be pretty
valuable considering

14:42.923 --> 14:44.466
you came straight
back here to get it.

14:44.550 --> 14:45.843
[Jinx]
You're a genius.

14:45.926 --> 14:48.220
Yeah, it's valuable
and it's dangerous.

14:48.304 --> 14:51.932
If you're smart,
you'll give it back to me
before someone gets hurt.

14:52.016 --> 14:55.936
Then again,
you are kind of into that.

14:56.020 --> 14:59.315
-[Dick chuckles]
-Okay. I don't know
whatever all this is,

14:59.398 --> 15:00.733
but we do
need your help.

15:00.816 --> 15:02.401
And the sooner
you give it to us,

15:02.484 --> 15:05.029
the sooner
you can have whatever's
in this box.

15:05.654 --> 15:06.905
Is that a heart?

15:06.989 --> 15:08.240
[heart beating]

15:11.076 --> 15:12.119
[Dick] Kory?

15:13.412 --> 15:15.080
Kory?

15:15.164 --> 15:16.665
-Undo it now.
-[Jinx scoffs]

15:16.749 --> 15:18.584
I love it when you get bossy.

15:18.667 --> 15:20.794
But there's nothing I can do.
It's not my spell.

15:20.878 --> 15:22.921
Is her heart beating?
Can she breathe?

15:23.005 --> 15:24.548
She'll be fine.

15:24.632 --> 15:25.549
I think.

15:25.633 --> 15:26.925
Tell me how
to get her back.

15:27.009 --> 15:29.928
I don't know.

15:30.012 --> 15:32.348
That box belonged
to Lironne, the dark elf.

15:33.515 --> 15:35.017
Probably her spell.

15:35.100 --> 15:36.852
-Did you just
say dark elf?
-[Jinx] Oh, I did.

15:36.935 --> 15:38.687
Yeah, that heart
was stolen from her.

15:38.771 --> 15:40.981
There's a hefty reward
for its return.

15:41.065 --> 15:43.275
Hey, maybe when
I take it back to her,

15:43.359 --> 15:44.693
she'll unrock your friend.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.070
I'll let you know.

15:46.153 --> 15:47.988
So this friend of yours
can undo the spell?

15:48.072 --> 15:50.366
No, I never said that
she was a friend.

15:50.449 --> 15:52.034
-I don't trust you
to go alone.
-[Jinx sighs]

15:52.117 --> 15:54.161
Fine. I'll take you
to the Lironne.

15:55.371 --> 15:56.914
But I collect
the finder's fee.

16:01.710 --> 16:03.295
[Dick] Wait. We can't just
leave her here.

16:03.379 --> 16:04.380
[Jinx chuckles]

16:04.463 --> 16:06.298
Trust me,
she's not going anywhere.

16:10.135 --> 16:12.137
I hate magic.

16:12.221 --> 16:13.972
-[man] But we're not...
-[woman] Yeah.

16:14.056 --> 16:17.059
[man] ...so they're just
going to have to live
with the deal.

16:17.142 --> 16:19.395
[man 2] Yeah, well,
I hate it, too.

16:19.478 --> 16:21.522
But she's the devil
that we know.

16:22.314 --> 16:23.315
So make it work.

16:24.900 --> 16:26.151
Yeah. All right.

16:27.486 --> 16:28.821
[Sebastian clears throat]

16:28.904 --> 16:32.825
Hi, I...
Sorry if I'm too early.

16:32.908 --> 16:33.951
Let me call you back.

16:36.203 --> 16:37.246
What are you doing here?

16:42.334 --> 16:45.629
You asked me
to come in to talk
about next steps.

16:45.713 --> 16:47.589
We told you yesterday, okay?

16:47.673 --> 16:49.425
We're not interested
in your game.

16:49.508 --> 16:51.969
You... you said
you'd reconsidered, so...

16:53.178 --> 16:54.388
What is this?

16:54.471 --> 16:56.223
Some twisted sales tactic?

16:56.306 --> 16:58.809
No. No, on the phone...

17:00.018 --> 17:02.980
-You said--
-I never called you.

17:03.063 --> 17:04.440
All right?
But if you don't
leave right now,

17:04.523 --> 17:05.774
I am calling security.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.151
Wait, wait, wait.

17:07.234 --> 17:08.318
Please. I...

17:08.402 --> 17:10.028
Look, I have the call.
I can...

17:10.112 --> 17:12.322
It's in my recents.
I can show you.

17:12.406 --> 17:13.699
Then you're going to see.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.368
It's, uh... Sorry.

17:16.452 --> 17:17.369
It's just...

17:17.453 --> 17:18.746
Sorry. Sorry.

17:18.829 --> 17:20.372
[voices chanting]
Azarath, Metrion, Zinthos!

17:20.456 --> 17:21.331
I'm sorry...

17:23.709 --> 17:26.795
[chanting continues]
Azarath, Metrion, Zinthos!

17:26.879 --> 17:27.963
What are you doing?

17:29.381 --> 17:31.091
No. Stop!

17:31.175 --> 17:32.259
[flesh squelches]

17:34.344 --> 17:35.262
Stop.

17:36.263 --> 17:37.931
Somebody help!

17:38.015 --> 17:39.558
-Help!
-[indistinct chatter]

17:41.560 --> 17:42.644
Help!

17:44.396 --> 17:45.689
-Please.
-[sirens approaching]

17:47.733 --> 17:48.776

17:57.743 --> 17:59.995
I was trying to help him.

18:01.121 --> 18:03.290
[breath trembling]

18:08.045 --> 18:09.505
I take it back.

18:09.588 --> 18:12.007
About being normal. Um...

18:12.090 --> 18:14.551
You know, when you're in
the middle of the creepy woods,

18:14.635 --> 18:17.638
being normal... sucks.

18:17.721 --> 18:18.889
[Gar growls]

18:18.972 --> 18:20.390
Something's coming.

18:20.474 --> 18:21.558
The witch?

18:21.642 --> 18:22.476
No.

18:23.644 --> 18:24.603
Something else.

18:25.813 --> 18:26.939
[birds screeching in distance]

18:30.025 --> 18:30.859
Whoa.

18:31.944 --> 18:32.820
Look.

18:35.239 --> 18:36.073
Where?

18:36.949 --> 18:37.825
The sky.

18:39.159 --> 18:40.160
Can't you see it?

18:42.746 --> 18:43.580
No.

18:44.248 --> 18:45.082
Here.

18:48.919 --> 18:49.962
How about now?

18:55.676 --> 18:56.677
We should turn back.

18:58.345 --> 19:00.180
I can't.

19:00.264 --> 19:02.349
I'll take you back home,
and come out on my own.

19:05.936 --> 19:07.563
No.

19:07.646 --> 19:08.689
Then we do this together.

19:22.286 --> 19:23.120
[panting]

19:23.912 --> 19:25.205
[grunting]

19:28.792 --> 19:29.918
[groaning]

19:32.337 --> 19:34.131
[Tim panting]

19:34.214 --> 19:35.716
You're watching me,
aren't you?

19:36.592 --> 19:37.426
No.

19:37.509 --> 19:39.177
Just monitoring your stats.

19:40.012 --> 19:40.971
[panting]

19:41.054 --> 19:42.598
I look like an idiot.

19:42.681 --> 19:44.933
You should see me
doing lateral lunges.

19:45.017 --> 19:47.311
I look like
a demented hermit crab.

19:47.394 --> 19:48.186
Hey, Bernard.

19:48.270 --> 19:49.479
[Tim continues grunting]

19:49.563 --> 19:51.440
Can you come look
at this for a minute?

19:51.523 --> 19:52.900
I've been
reviewing these stills

19:52.983 --> 19:54.985
from the CCTV footage
of the slaughterhouse.

19:55.068 --> 19:56.904
[Bernard] It's some kind
of occult symbol.

19:56.987 --> 19:58.238
[Conner] That's what
I thought, too.
But I've run it through

19:58.322 --> 20:01.658
every occult database,
no hits.

20:01.742 --> 20:04.119
I mean,
if you're murdering people
for their blood,

20:04.202 --> 20:05.996
who's to say
what kind of wall art

20:06.079 --> 20:07.748
-piques your fancy?
-Hmm.

20:07.831 --> 20:10.334
[Conner] These lines.
Too deliberate.

20:12.044 --> 20:14.087
The word occult means hidden.

20:14.171 --> 20:16.798
The lead we're looking for,
it might be hiding
in plain sight.

20:16.882 --> 20:19.468
So if I run a search
for corporate logos,

20:19.551 --> 20:22.554
social media avatars,
recent Discord posts

20:22.638 --> 20:24.765
-within the last
30 days...
-Hmm.

20:25.557 --> 20:26.934
In the meantime,

20:27.017 --> 20:29.019
check the blood samples
from yesterday.

20:29.102 --> 20:32.147
See if there's any sort
of genetic connection
between the victims.

20:32.230 --> 20:34.358
You think these people
might all be related?

20:34.441 --> 20:36.526
[Conner] These people weren't
chosen randomly.

20:37.277 --> 20:38.278
There's a pattern.

20:39.571 --> 20:40.781
I just need to find it.

20:41.573 --> 20:42.866
I did have lunch plans...

20:44.952 --> 20:46.828
that I would be
thrilled to cancel.

20:46.912 --> 20:48.330
-[computer beeps]
-[Tim grunting]

20:57.005 --> 20:59.716
Look at us.
Just like old times.

20:59.800 --> 21:01.176
Let's just not talk.

21:01.259 --> 21:03.136
Wow. Okay.

21:03.220 --> 21:05.222
This girl must
be different.

21:05.305 --> 21:07.975
I figured she was just
your next pump
and dump informant.

21:08.058 --> 21:10.519
Always had such
a tender way with words,
didn't you?

21:10.602 --> 21:13.021
Excuse me, Lord Byron.

21:13.105 --> 21:14.648
Just telling it
like it is.

21:16.483 --> 21:17.734
Was.

21:17.818 --> 21:19.653
We both knew the deal.
Gotham was just business.

21:19.736 --> 21:21.530
And a little fun
on the side.

21:21.613 --> 21:22.906
You played me.

21:22.990 --> 21:24.616
You gave me no choice.

21:24.700 --> 21:26.368
Yeah, well,
if you'd trusted me
instead of burning me

21:26.451 --> 21:28.870
-to Constantine.
-You blew my chance
to get Two-Face.

21:28.954 --> 21:30.455
[Jinx sighs]

21:30.539 --> 21:31.832
You came out on top.
That's all that
mattered to you.

21:31.915 --> 21:33.542
I thought
you liked me on top.

21:36.712 --> 21:37.921
Okay, so...

21:38.839 --> 21:40.882
You never trusted me.

21:40.966 --> 21:42.718
But you're coming
to me again. Why?

21:42.801 --> 21:45.220
Last night,
I went up against
someone very powerful.

21:45.303 --> 21:47.139
She took on me
and my whole team.

21:47.222 --> 21:48.724
We were lucky
to get out alive.

21:48.807 --> 21:50.434
-Supernatural?
-Very.

21:51.518 --> 21:53.895
What style?
What school?

21:53.979 --> 21:56.398
Oh, I think she got her BA
from Harvard. I don't know.

21:56.481 --> 21:59.067
Her power.
What did it look like?

21:59.151 --> 22:00.318
Red waves.

22:00.402 --> 22:01.737
What did she look like?

22:01.820 --> 22:03.989
Tall, dark hair,
dark robe.

22:04.072 --> 22:05.198
She had a staff.

22:05.282 --> 22:06.992
A magical staff?

22:07.075 --> 22:07.951
You know her?

22:09.327 --> 22:10.579
No.

22:10.662 --> 22:12.164
But my advice...

22:12.247 --> 22:13.415
Don't fuck with her.

22:13.498 --> 22:15.584
You are way
out of your league.

22:15.667 --> 22:17.252
Yeah, I know that.

22:17.336 --> 22:19.171
If I was in my league,
I wouldn't have
tracked you down.

22:19.254 --> 22:22.966
What? Like, I'm supposed
to know every crazy witch
with a staff?

22:23.842 --> 22:24.676
It'd help.

22:33.602 --> 22:35.937
Where is this dark elf
hanging out, anyways?

22:36.021 --> 22:37.898
I don't see Santa's
sleigh anywhere.

22:37.981 --> 22:39.274
Uh, not that kind of elf.

22:39.357 --> 22:42.069
And talk like that
will get your ass kicked.

22:42.152 --> 22:43.320
Right, by elves.

22:43.403 --> 22:45.697
Yeah, by elves.
They're badass.

22:45.781 --> 22:48.492
They're like
Lord of the Rings elves--

22:48.575 --> 22:50.077

very expensive here.

to get in.
