WEBVTT

00:00.042 --> 00:01.919
Previously on Legacy.

00:02.002 --> 00:03.921
Carl Rogers, you've been served.

00:04.004 --> 00:07.508
Did you really think I'd let you get away
with murder, you malevolent fuck?

00:07.591 --> 00:11.011
If we ramp up production too fast,
we blow the whole operation.

00:11.095 --> 00:12.263
-People are bound to notice.

00:12.346 --> 00:14.140
-You have one week.
-I need more time.

00:14.223 --> 00:15.766
Don't fuck around with these guys, Harry.

00:15.850 --> 00:17.518
-Not to be trifled with.
-Neither am I.

00:17.601 --> 00:19.895
You had a son.
His name was Dominick Santanello.

00:19.979 --> 00:22.106
Died in Vietnam
just short of his 20th birthday.

00:22.189 --> 00:23.482
Name on the shirt. Lewis?

00:23.566 --> 00:25.401
That was a friend of his,
a fellow medic.

00:25.484 --> 00:26.318
You living here?

00:26.402 --> 00:28.279
Time being.
They red-tagged my house.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.948
The more you take,
the harder it is for me to hide it.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.158
They're sure to notice
a second tap.

00:32.241 --> 00:35.703
He was in the bedroom,
waiting for me. He had a knife.

00:35.786 --> 00:38.831
The victim needs to be taken to
Santa Monica Hospital for her SART exam.

00:38.914 --> 00:39.749
I'll bring her out.

00:39.832 --> 00:41.751
-Stay in my lane?
-Exactly.

00:41.834 --> 00:46.172
If anything starts to go sideways,
I can erase this complete operation.

00:46.255 --> 00:48.048
-Can you hear anything?
-Not a damn thing.

00:49.258 --> 00:50.968
Stick it in your phone
and hit record.

00:51.051 --> 00:54.138
Rogers, Wakefield, and these two,
Pensak and Aslan.

00:54.221 --> 00:56.182
Security like Fort fucking Knox.

00:56.265 --> 00:58.225
I need to get into that building.

01:08.319 --> 01:09.695
Keep your hands up.

01:09.779 --> 01:14.325
Easy, pal. You don't wanna shoot me.
Put your gun down.

01:14.408 --> 01:16.869
I'm with Trident Security.
We're here doing a field test.

01:16.952 --> 01:18.329
-Bullshit.
-You know what's bullshit?

01:18.412 --> 01:21.123
The level of security here,
that's bullshit.

01:21.207 --> 01:23.876
You're the first officer I've come
into contact with the whole night.

01:23.959 --> 01:26.295
No wonder Mr. Aslan
wants us to do a security test.

01:26.378 --> 01:28.464
-What if I was a terrorist?
-How do I know you aren't one?

01:28.547 --> 01:29.799
-Keep your hands up.

01:31.300 --> 01:33.511
I'm reaching for my wallet.

01:40.226 --> 01:42.645
John Creighton,
VP Trident Security.

01:42.728 --> 01:44.396
VP. Trident Security.

01:44.480 --> 01:47.525
Put your fucking gun away.
Take this, put it here.

01:49.485 --> 01:50.486
Let me see your badge.

01:53.823 --> 01:54.824
Now what are you gonna do with that?

01:54.907 --> 01:55.908
Well, that depends.

01:55.991 --> 01:57.827
Please don't report me.
I need this job.

01:57.910 --> 01:59.662
Tell you what,
you escort me to the front gate

01:59.745 --> 02:01.080
and you give me
a couple of good reasons

02:01.163 --> 02:03.165
why I don't shitcan you
here on the spot.

02:03.249 --> 02:04.250
Let's go.

02:23.686 --> 02:25.145
Beginning to think you were MIA.

02:25.229 --> 02:26.564
Ye of little faith.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.023
How'd it go?

02:28.107 --> 02:30.484
Let's get out of Dodge.

02:30.568 --> 02:31.819
I'm buyin'.

03:52.441 --> 03:55.194
Stolen gas gets siphoned
into Aslan's tankers.

03:55.277 --> 03:59.156
Crate and Barrel tailed one
to a Sokol station in Palmdale.

03:59.239 --> 04:02.952
Hmm. Free gas.
Can't beat the profit margin.

04:03.035 --> 04:05.079
Well, Rogers is in hock to the Russians.

04:05.162 --> 04:08.040
He's under serious pressure
to deliver more gas.

04:08.123 --> 04:09.249
How's he gonna do that?

04:09.333 --> 04:11.251
Install a second tap.

04:13.003 --> 04:15.130
But if he tinkers with the output,
won't the refinery notice?

04:15.214 --> 04:16.048
Immediately.

04:16.131 --> 04:17.675
Triggers all kinds of alarms

04:17.758 --> 04:21.261
and hot-tapping into a live pipeline,
it's off-the-charts dangerous.

04:22.763 --> 04:23.764
So what's his move?

04:23.847 --> 04:26.850
He needs to get a section of the
pipeline shut down for routine maintenance

04:26.934 --> 04:30.062
so he can install the second tap,
start a new baseline.

04:31.605 --> 04:32.815
We need to know when.

04:35.609 --> 04:36.902
Any ideas?

04:40.698 --> 04:41.907
Oregon.

04:44.702 --> 04:45.536
Hitchhiked.

04:47.121 --> 04:50.541
The driver asked her to perform
a sex act, she said no, got out.

04:52.084 --> 04:53.711
Great, thanks.
We're on our way.

04:54.712 --> 04:56.296
Hope you like sausage.

04:56.380 --> 04:58.007
Starved. We both are.

04:58.090 --> 04:59.299
Any luck?

04:59.383 --> 05:00.259
They'll take her.

05:00.342 --> 05:02.344
Rockin' good news.

05:02.428 --> 05:03.262
Let's go.

05:34.918 --> 05:37.755
Mr. Vance, it's Harry Bosch again.
Could you please give me a call?

05:37.838 --> 05:40.966
I have some new information for you.
You have my number.

05:52.478 --> 05:54.021
Mr. Vance, it's Harry Bosch again.

05:54.104 --> 05:56.774
Could you please give me a call?
I have some new information for you.

05:56.857 --> 05:57.816
You have my number.

06:05.783 --> 06:06.742
Come in.

06:09.828 --> 06:10.829
How is he?

06:10.913 --> 06:14.958
Mm, he's still breathing. Barely.

06:16.960 --> 06:18.295
Where's the nurse?

06:18.378 --> 06:19.630
She's on a break.

06:22.216 --> 06:25.302
Do you mind?
Um, I really should get back to work.

06:25.385 --> 06:26.386
Happy to.

06:26.470 --> 06:29.765
Great. She should be back
in about ten minutes.

06:29.848 --> 06:31.475
It's fine. I don't mind.

06:33.852 --> 06:34.686
I'll read to him.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.194
Almost done, Mr. Vance.

06:42.277 --> 06:44.279
Almost done.

06:46.824 --> 06:47.825
Forty years.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.121
Where did we leave off?

06:59.294 --> 07:01.547
"It had begun to snow again.

07:04.091 --> 07:07.386
It lay thickly drifted on
the crooked crosses and headstones.

07:08.387 --> 07:10.889
On the spears of the little gate.

07:10.973 --> 07:13.016
On the barren thorns.

07:15.060 --> 07:17.646
His soul swooned slowly as he heard

07:17.729 --> 07:20.732
the snow falling faintly
through the universe."

07:22.151 --> 07:26.655
"And faintly falling,
like the descent of their last end.

07:28.824 --> 07:30.701
Upon all the living and the dead."

07:34.580 --> 07:35.789
There.

07:37.291 --> 07:38.125
It's done.

07:53.140 --> 07:54.057
Forty years.

07:56.602 --> 08:00.147
And you never knew.

08:03.692 --> 08:07.029
Where are the snows
of yesteryear, Mr. Vance?

08:10.073 --> 08:11.074
Where are they?

08:15.871 --> 08:18.457
Grandpa, can I get
another chocolate croissant?

08:18.540 --> 08:21.376
If you can pronounce it,
I guess you can have it.

08:21.460 --> 08:22.836
Don't let him take advantage, Pop.

08:24.087 --> 08:25.380
Who's taking advantage?

08:26.423 --> 08:29.343
Simon. Thought I might find you here.

08:29.426 --> 08:31.011
Honey Chandler.

08:31.094 --> 08:32.179
Garrett Wakefield.

08:32.262 --> 08:35.682
Pleased to meet you.
I'm practically a neighbor of your dad's.

08:36.558 --> 08:37.392
Simon, a word?

08:47.527 --> 08:51.573
Our civil suit will expose your son's
fraudulent real estate appraisals.

08:51.657 --> 08:53.367
Which Carl Rogers
and his cronies

08:53.450 --> 08:56.620
have used to obtain
millions of dollars in bank loans.

08:59.164 --> 09:00.666
What do you want?

09:00.749 --> 09:02.459
I wanna know
when Rogers and Aslan

09:02.542 --> 09:05.629
are gonna shut down the pipeline
and install the second tap.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.425
Feeling all right, Simon?

09:11.510 --> 09:13.178
Having a little klong?

09:13.262 --> 09:14.846
Klong?

09:15.973 --> 09:17.641
A sudden rush of shit to the heart.

09:18.684 --> 09:20.102
Fuck off, Chandler.

09:26.275 --> 09:27.109
Bingo.

09:45.127 --> 09:46.878
Don't forget your bag, ma'am.

09:55.804 --> 09:57.514
Want us to walk in with you?

09:57.597 --> 09:58.974
I don't wanna stay here.

09:59.057 --> 10:00.058
Why not?

10:00.142 --> 10:01.393
Don't like the look of it.

10:01.476 --> 10:03.812
You lucked out.
There's a waiting list to get in here.

10:03.895 --> 10:05.188
So somebody else can have my spot.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.398
It's all set up for you.

10:06.481 --> 10:07.607
I'll be fine on the street.

10:10.485 --> 10:11.570
We can find you somewhere else.

10:11.653 --> 10:13.488
-Thanks for breakfast.
-Let her go.

10:15.365 --> 10:16.366
She needs help.

10:16.450 --> 10:18.285
We can't force her to take it.

10:28.295 --> 10:31.298
Dominick Santanello. June '71.

10:31.381 --> 10:34.551
Boot camp at Naval Training Center,
San Diego.

10:34.634 --> 10:37.054
After basic, Balboa Naval Hospital.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.222
Finished up at Field Medical School,
Camp Pendleton.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.767
Anybody in his class
make the same stops?

10:41.850 --> 10:42.851
Oh...

10:48.565 --> 10:51.943
Yeah, eight other corpsman
were assigned to Balboa Naval Hospital.

10:52.027 --> 10:53.612
And from Balboa to Pendleton?

10:56.823 --> 10:57.657
Three of those eight.

10:57.741 --> 10:59.201
What happened to them?

10:59.284 --> 11:01.411
Two of them KIA in Vietnam.

11:01.536 --> 11:03.372
Halley Lewis did his tour
and came home.

11:03.455 --> 11:05.415
Lewis? Where's home?

11:05.499 --> 11:07.334
I'll give you the address.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.171
Hopefully he's survived civilian life.

11:12.506 --> 11:17.052
The Russians leaned on Willie Datz
to change his testimony about Carl Rogers.

11:17.135 --> 11:18.303
Datz won't testify to that.

11:18.387 --> 11:19.513
Rogers will.

11:19.596 --> 11:21.890
And to hiring the hitman
and everything that followed.

11:21.973 --> 11:24.643
All four murders, etcetera, etcetera.

11:26.520 --> 11:27.521
You were a part of that etcetera.

11:27.604 --> 11:30.482
Mm-hmm. I have the scars to prove it.

11:32.150 --> 11:32.984
What does he want?

11:33.068 --> 11:34.611
Leniency and protection.

11:34.694 --> 11:36.029
Protection we can give him.

11:37.114 --> 11:38.865
Why would we show him leniency?

11:38.949 --> 11:43.537
Because of what he can give you
on Bratva in LA.

11:43.620 --> 11:46.331
Murders, money laundering, racketeering...

11:46.415 --> 11:47.749
Why has he come to you?

11:47.833 --> 11:50.001
Well, he hasn't. Not yet.

11:50.085 --> 11:52.921
His attorney has reached out
to settle the civil suit.

11:53.922 --> 11:57.134
I'll convince him
his client would be better off inside.

11:59.469 --> 12:00.303
Think they'll go for it?

12:01.471 --> 12:04.266
His life expectancy
out in the world is pretty grim.

12:05.267 --> 12:06.351
Isn't that just what you want?

12:08.812 --> 12:11.189
I want him to live to a ripe old age.

12:12.149 --> 12:13.150
And suffer.

12:19.739 --> 12:22.075
Holy moly. You got any Dramamine?

12:22.159 --> 12:24.244
There. Punch in right there.

12:26.121 --> 12:28.081
Hell's that?

12:28.165 --> 12:30.584
Plastic explosive.
Connects to a receiver.

12:30.667 --> 12:31.501
How you know that?

12:31.585 --> 12:34.296
I've seen it before. Tora Bora.

12:34.379 --> 12:35.505
Tahiti?

12:35.589 --> 12:37.716
Afghanistan. The tunnels.

12:39.509 --> 12:41.178
So that's an IED?

12:41.261 --> 12:43.263
That's a daisy chain
of ANFO blocks.

12:43.346 --> 12:44.806
Ammonium nitrate fuel oil.

12:44.890 --> 12:47.934
It's easy to use,
you can find it at any construction site.

12:48.018 --> 12:49.436
They wired up their own tunnel?

12:49.519 --> 12:50.687
It's a kill switch.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.898
Destroy the evidence
with the push of a button.

12:52.981 --> 12:53.982
Hmm.

12:55.150 --> 12:55.984
So what's the plan?

12:56.067 --> 12:57.486
Help 'em push it.

12:57.569 --> 12:58.695
Excuse me?

12:58.778 --> 13:00.489
Push the button.

13:00.572 --> 13:01.865
We're gonna blow the tunnel?

13:02.991 --> 13:06.411
When the line is shut down.
No casualties.

13:06.495 --> 13:07.496
I'm for that.

13:09.164 --> 13:11.917
I'm gonna need to be boots on the ground
to give you the go-ahead.

13:12.000 --> 13:15.504
You'll set it off. From a distance.
When the time's right.

13:16.713 --> 13:18.381
Mm, with what and how?

13:18.465 --> 13:20.008
You'll figure it out.

13:21.801 --> 13:24.262
You know there's no such thing
as a universal remote, right?

13:24.346 --> 13:25.180
That's, like, a myth.

13:25.263 --> 13:27.516
No pressure.

13:27.599 --> 13:28.433
Mm.

13:37.317 --> 13:40.946
If you think of anything, see anything,
just give me a call?

13:41.029 --> 13:42.447
You got it.

13:45.534 --> 13:46.368
Bosch.

13:46.451 --> 13:47.744
Officer Bosch.

13:47.827 --> 13:48.828
Who's this?

13:48.912 --> 13:51.122
Preeda Saetang.
You gave me your card.

13:52.541 --> 13:53.750
Is everything okay?

13:53.833 --> 13:56.169
I wanted to ask your advice.

13:56.253 --> 13:57.754
About?

13:57.837 --> 14:01.216
A security system.
I-I don't know where to begin.

14:04.261 --> 14:07.055
Listen, I-I happen to be
in the neighborhood. Is now a good time?

14:08.056 --> 14:09.182
Yes.

14:09.266 --> 14:11.768
Awesome. I'm-I'm right around the corner.
I'll see you in a few.

14:21.987 --> 14:22.904
Halley Lewis?

14:23.989 --> 14:26.408
If you're here about
those milkweed cuttings,

14:26.491 --> 14:28.577
I gave 'em all the way this morning.

14:28.660 --> 14:30.453
Oh, I don't know from milkweed.

14:32.122 --> 14:34.457
My name is Bosch.
I'm a private investigator.

14:35.792 --> 14:37.919
I understand Dominick Santanello
was a friend of yours.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.798
Well, that's a name from the past.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.133
Fifty years.

14:44.301 --> 14:46.094
Yeah, Nicky Santanello.
What's this about?

14:46.177 --> 14:47.596
He may have come into some money.

14:49.055 --> 14:49.889
You're a little late.

14:49.973 --> 14:52.601
Not for his child. If he had one.

14:52.684 --> 14:53.518
Did he have one?

14:53.602 --> 14:55.895
How am I supposed to know
if Nicky had a kid?

14:55.979 --> 14:59.399
Well, maybe you wouldn't know.

14:59.482 --> 15:01.735
I was under the impression
you two guys were tight.

15:09.576 --> 15:13.330
Oh, man. That was the day
Nick took the swim test for me.

15:14.372 --> 15:15.749
Saved my ass.

15:15.832 --> 15:19.669
I would have been washed right out
of the Navy.

15:19.753 --> 15:20.754
How about a lemonade?

15:26.801 --> 15:29.137
One in the front door
and one in the back door.

15:30.805 --> 15:34.476
I'd also install entry sensors
on the doors and windows.

15:34.559 --> 15:35.435
That make sense.

15:37.646 --> 15:41.483
Honestly, the best thing you can do,
buy a shotgun.

15:41.608 --> 15:43.068
Or a large dog.

15:44.944 --> 15:45.779
How are you?

15:47.197 --> 15:49.616
Okay. Hard time sleeping.

15:49.699 --> 15:51.660
Yeah, I can only imagine.

15:51.743 --> 15:55.372
I'm also on this app all the time.
Neighborhood. You have it?

15:55.455 --> 15:57.290
Heard of it.

15:57.374 --> 16:00.210
I'm always checking it.
For crime in the area.

16:00.293 --> 16:01.628
Like, I can't help it.

16:02.587 --> 16:04.047
Anything we should know about?

16:04.130 --> 16:05.382
Anything like what happened to you?

16:06.383 --> 16:11.554
No rapes. Some break-ins.
Uh, cut window screens. Peeping Toms.

16:12.806 --> 16:16.101
Try not to obsess. Okay?

16:16.184 --> 16:17.977
And get some sleep.

16:20.063 --> 16:22.190
Thanks for coming over
and helping with all of this.

16:22.273 --> 16:23.316
You're a good person, Maddie.

16:32.242 --> 16:33.076
Thank you.

16:39.040 --> 16:40.333
I was sent to Subic Bay.

16:43.253 --> 16:45.964
Nick-- he was sent to Da Nang.

16:47.090 --> 16:48.299
We lost touch.

16:48.383 --> 16:51.594
And...
I hear his chopper went down.

16:51.678 --> 16:54.514
He was killed in Tay Ninh Province.

16:57.058 --> 16:58.226
Something I wanna show you.

17:06.234 --> 17:07.527
Nick took this picture?

17:08.778 --> 17:12.240
Yeah. On the beach, at the Hotel Del.
Middle of his tour.

17:14.576 --> 17:16.369
He snuck back?

17:16.453 --> 17:18.663
He was one nervy bastard.

17:19.831 --> 17:21.166
You know the woman?

17:21.249 --> 17:22.667
Yeah, I remember her.

17:22.751 --> 17:24.669
She was a little older than us.

17:26.129 --> 17:27.130
Latina.

17:28.298 --> 17:29.132
Gorgeous.

17:29.215 --> 17:32.010
Maybe 24, 25.

17:32.093 --> 17:33.136
Maybe 30.

17:36.431 --> 17:40.226
Boy, he saw her, he was...
he was smitten.

17:40.310 --> 17:41.853
Remember her name?

17:41.936 --> 17:43.980
No, I can't remember that.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.690
Too long.

17:47.192 --> 17:48.401
Any idea where they met?

17:48.485 --> 17:51.988
Yeah, yeah, at the Surfrider.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.364
In Oceanside.

17:53.448 --> 17:55.200
That was our hangout.

17:56.826 --> 17:58.244
Do you remember anything about her?

18:00.705 --> 18:01.873
She was a photojournalist.

18:01.956 --> 18:04.793
For some Chicano paper
out of Los Angeles.

18:04.876 --> 18:08.338
She was sent down to Pendleton
to do an anti-war story.

18:08.421 --> 18:14.427
She does an interview with him
and you could see right away...

18:16.179 --> 18:19.098
...that this guy was gone.

18:19.182 --> 18:21.267
One gone pecan.

18:23.436 --> 18:24.813
Remember the name of the paper?

18:24.896 --> 18:28.066
No, no. El something or La something.

18:28.149 --> 18:28.983
Sorry.

18:30.193 --> 18:31.236
Anything else?

18:31.319 --> 18:34.531
No, I can't remember anything anymore.
It's all gone. I'm...

18:35.532 --> 18:39.619
I'm having trouble remembering
what Nick looked like.

18:40.578 --> 18:41.412
Well...

18:41.496 --> 18:42.497
Here.

18:42.580 --> 18:43.540
You've been very helpful.

18:44.916 --> 18:47.377
You come back here.
You drop by anytime.

18:47.460 --> 18:50.046
Will do. Thanks, brother.

18:50.129 --> 18:53.132
And hey, good luck with that.

18:53.216 --> 18:55.134
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

19:12.277 --> 19:13.361
Chandler.

19:13.444 --> 19:15.697
Have you considered
what we discussed?

19:15.780 --> 19:17.198
I have.

19:17.282 --> 19:18.741
Listening.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.326
Hands off my son?

19:20.410 --> 19:22.328
When is the shutdown?

19:22.412 --> 19:23.246
I have your word?

19:23.329 --> 19:26.916
You do. Now, when, Simon?

19:27.000 --> 19:27.834
I don't know yet.

19:27.917 --> 19:29.168
Then you're out of time.

19:29.252 --> 19:33.339
I will. Soon. Today.

19:33.423 --> 19:35.049
Tick tock.

19:37.343 --> 19:39.345
Oh, fuck me.

19:52.483 --> 19:53.943
I can't authorize this, Russ.

19:54.027 --> 19:56.070
We've already got maintenance
scheduled for three weeks out.

19:56.154 --> 19:58.406
You gotta pull it up.
We can't wait.

19:58.489 --> 20:00.116
This situation
needs to be dealt with.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.534
What situation?

20:01.618 --> 20:04.537
Our smart PIGs
detected corrosion in 453.

20:04.621 --> 20:06.956
And this is the first
I'm hearing about it?

20:07.040 --> 20:09.375
It was in my overnight report.

20:09.459 --> 20:11.502
I'm telling you,
we're gonna have leaks.

20:11.586 --> 20:14.589
And the last thing we want
is another CalGEM violation.

20:17.050 --> 20:19.802
So I cleaned up the recording
of the meeting at the diner.

20:20.762 --> 20:23.473
Just remember,
if anything starts to go sideways,

20:23.556 --> 20:27.352
I can erase this complete operation
in an instant.

20:28.811 --> 20:31.981
When Aslan said that,
he took out his car keys.

20:32.065 --> 20:34.233
Car keys?
Was there a key fob?

20:35.234 --> 20:38.279
Key fob. Yeah, could've been. Why?

20:38.363 --> 20:40.698
Could that be the remote
for setting off the IED?

21:36.295 --> 21:37.296
Wakefield?

21:39.424 --> 21:40.425
Are you here?

21:45.304 --> 21:46.305
Simon?

21:52.687 --> 21:53.688
Simon?

22:03.740 --> 22:05.158
Shit.

22:06.492 --> 22:08.119
Shit.

22:09.704 --> 22:10.705
Shit!

22:21.257 --> 22:22.300
Yeah, it's me.

22:22.383 --> 22:25.636
I'm gonna need to connect
with your tech guy. ASAP.

23:08.513 --> 23:12.141
Carl. What an unexpected pleasure.

23:12.225 --> 23:15.686
Fuck happened to Simon?
Why'd you kill him, for Christ sake?

23:15.770 --> 23:17.605
-He was talking.
-Like hell he was.

23:17.688 --> 23:20.775
With lady lawyer you tried to kill.
One suing you.

23:20.858 --> 23:21.776
Impossible.

23:21.859 --> 23:23.486
Saw with own eyes.

23:23.569 --> 23:25.905
Sell you down the river.
Make deal.

23:28.282 --> 23:29.867
I don't believe that.

23:29.951 --> 23:33.287
Also sonny boy. You should know.

23:35.373 --> 23:38.167
Bank fraud. Mega loans.

23:39.710 --> 23:41.212
You think we don't know?

23:43.089 --> 23:46.175
You're still above ground
for one reason.

23:46.259 --> 23:49.679
To get us our fuckin' money.

23:51.681 --> 23:52.723
So get tapping.

23:53.891 --> 23:55.309
Tap, tap.

23:58.729 --> 24:00.022
How's the housing situation?

24:01.482 --> 24:03.985
I'll know today
after I meet with the contractor.

24:04.068 --> 24:05.444
How's work?

24:05.528 --> 24:06.362
It's good.

24:09.365 --> 24:11.576
I told you about that rape call
we got a couple weeks ago.

24:11.659 --> 24:13.286
Yeah. And?

24:14.620 --> 24:16.873
I gave her my cell.

24:16.956 --> 24:18.583
The victim.

24:18.666 --> 24:20.376
She reached out.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.170
What'd you do?

24:23.754 --> 24:28.217
Dropped by her place.
Tried to reassure her.

24:28.301 --> 24:30.011
How's the case? Any leads?

24:30.094 --> 24:31.095
Not that I know of.

24:32.430 --> 24:34.140
I just can't let it go.

24:36.684 --> 24:37.685
I understand that.

24:37.768 --> 24:39.395
Yeah, you took every case personally.

24:39.478 --> 24:41.939
Well, as a homicide detective,
I had to.

24:42.023 --> 24:44.233
My victims couldn't call me.

24:45.234 --> 24:46.694
I had to speak for them.

24:47.820 --> 24:49.697
What about when you were a beat cop?

24:49.780 --> 24:51.199
Oh...

24:51.282 --> 24:53.618
You have to pick and choose your battles.

24:53.701 --> 24:56.787
At the end of the day,
you have to decide

24:56.871 --> 24:59.081
what kind of a cop
you wanna be.

24:59.165 --> 25:03.044
It's either a mission
or it's just a job.

25:18.517 --> 25:19.477
You knew him?

25:22.230 --> 25:23.522
Client.

25:24.523 --> 25:28.611
Sometimes a person
tries to set things right.

25:30.655 --> 25:31.781
You just run out of time.

25:34.283 --> 25:37.870
Carl Rogers wants to settle.
He wants to put this thing to bed.

25:40.456 --> 25:42.500
My client may be open to that.

25:42.583 --> 25:44.001
Uh, depends on the details.

25:44.085 --> 25:45.836
How do we move forward?

25:45.920 --> 25:50.883
We set a time and place of our choosing
and he has to be there in the room.

25:50.967 --> 25:53.719
No Zoom, no teleconference.

25:53.803 --> 25:56.305
I want him face to face
as we negotiate.

25:59.225 --> 26:00.810
I'll, um...

26:00.893 --> 26:02.687
I'll get back to you.

26:06.482 --> 26:08.109
This is Larry Mantle.

26:08.192 --> 26:12.446
News of Whitney Vance's death reverberated
through the markets today

26:12.530 --> 26:15.825
as shares in Advance Engineering
took a 5% tumble.

26:16.826 --> 26:18.911
The entire aviation sector was down...

26:18.995 --> 26:20.496
Who's this?

26:20.579 --> 26:22.957
This is David Sloan.

26:23.040 --> 26:23.874
Sloan, what do you want?

26:23.958 --> 26:27.003
Mr. Vance has shuffled off
this mortal coil.

26:27.086 --> 26:28.921
Your services are no longer needed.

26:48.482 --> 26:50.735
Hey. Am I late?

26:50.818 --> 26:52.486
Oh, I got here early.

26:52.570 --> 26:54.905
Just give me a sec,
I gotta throw on some coveralls.

26:54.989 --> 26:56.240
No need.
I've already been under the house.

26:57.241 --> 26:58.284
And?

26:58.367 --> 26:59.785
Did you ever sort out your insurance?

27:00.786 --> 27:04.040
I let my quake coverage lapse.

27:04.123 --> 27:04.957
Ah.

27:05.958 --> 27:08.336
Shit. Maybe I should just sell.

27:08.419 --> 27:10.755
I'll work up an estimate
for repairs and retrofit.

27:12.340 --> 27:13.382
Ballpark?

27:13.466 --> 27:15.468
Let me run the numbers first.

27:15.551 --> 27:16.552
You have a nice day.

27:16.635 --> 27:17.470
Yeah, you too.

27:33.652 --> 27:35.112
I appreciate the quick turnaround.

27:35.196 --> 27:38.115
Just popped this SIM card
in a big ass bowl of rice.

27:38.199 --> 27:39.867
Oh, and I data-dumped everything,

27:39.950 --> 27:42.286
including his contact, calls,
apps, and texts.

27:42.370 --> 27:44.622
Whatever he's paying you,
it's not enough.

27:44.705 --> 27:46.082
Amen, sister.

27:46.165 --> 27:47.458
Thank you so much.

27:47.541 --> 27:48.376
Appreciate you.

27:57.885 --> 27:58.719
Chandler.

27:58.803 --> 28:01.222
It's happening. Tonight.

28:03.182 --> 28:05.309
Let's go. All right, get in there.

28:37.174 --> 28:39.635
Filing a petition for probate as we speak.

28:39.718 --> 28:42.930
Barring any hiccups, all of Mr. Vance's
shares and interest in the company

28:43.013 --> 28:45.224
should pass smoothly to the board.

28:45.307 --> 28:46.350
How long?

28:46.434 --> 28:47.852
Weeks, not months.

28:48.853 --> 28:50.938
Good to hear. I'll be in touch.

28:51.021 --> 28:52.898
John. What's up?

28:53.941 --> 28:54.775
Harry Bosch.

28:54.859 --> 28:55.693
Stay on him?

28:59.155 --> 29:00.156
Pull back for now.

29:04.410 --> 29:06.036
Your guy's a genius, by the way.

29:06.120 --> 29:07.163
He likes to think so.

29:07.246 --> 29:09.665
So I combed through
all of Wakefield's texts.

29:09.748 --> 29:12.418
Last week,
he sent Rogers a photo of a blueprint.

29:12.501 --> 29:14.879
I'm texting it to you right now.

29:14.962 --> 29:17.298
I'm driving. I'll look at it later.

29:17.381 --> 29:18.591
A blueprint of what?

29:18.674 --> 29:21.677
A 20x8 rectangular structure.

29:21.760 --> 29:22.720
Any text?

29:22.803 --> 29:24.346
Just the word "Plano."

29:25.347 --> 29:26.765
A town in Texas.

29:26.849 --> 29:28.309
It's also an import-export company.

29:28.392 --> 29:30.519
Rogers is a major shareholder.

29:30.603 --> 29:32.438
Oh, and there's a number.

29:32.521 --> 29:33.772
Seven digits.

29:33.856 --> 29:35.816
Stick a pin it for now.
I gotta go.

29:35.900 --> 29:37.401
Good luck.

29:37.485 --> 29:39.111
The tunnel's coming down.

29:39.195 --> 29:40.529
That would be my preference.

29:40.613 --> 29:41.447
And mine.

29:49.788 --> 29:51.916
Oh, Matthew,
could you come here for a sec?

29:54.335 --> 29:55.169
What's up?

29:55.252 --> 29:57.421
Would you look into
this Plano business?

29:57.505 --> 29:59.715
The blueprint.
Let me know what you find.

29:59.798 --> 30:00.716
Sure thing.

30:00.799 --> 30:01.717
Okay, thanks.

30:11.727 --> 30:12.770
How's that looking?

30:12.853 --> 30:14.396
I'm working on it.

30:14.480 --> 30:15.606
Clock's ticking.

30:15.689 --> 30:18.734
You think stealing an RFID signal
off a key fob's a walk in the park?

30:18.817 --> 30:21.904
Okay, take me through this
one more time.

30:21.987 --> 30:24.073
You got the key-spoofing device
I gave you.

30:24.156 --> 30:26.742
How close do I have to get to Aslan
to grab the signal?

30:26.825 --> 30:29.537
Fifty-foot proximity in order
to spoof the key fob signal.

30:29.620 --> 30:31.747
And then I'm gonna decrypt
the spoof and relay hack

30:31.830 --> 30:34.583
between my RFID transponder
and the electrical.

30:34.667 --> 30:36.585
Yeah, that'd been easier
if it was in Braille.

30:36.669 --> 30:37.795
Maurice. English, please.

30:39.255 --> 30:41.757
You steal the signal.
You toss it to me.

30:41.840 --> 30:45.052
At the right moment,
I toss it to the tunnel-- kablooey.

30:45.135 --> 30:47.596
You see? How hard was that?

30:47.680 --> 30:48.931
We'll communicate with these.

30:52.518 --> 30:53.811
Keep at it.

30:56.063 --> 30:57.064
I'll see you there.

31:09.994 --> 31:10.828
Yeah.

31:12.871 --> 31:14.373
Okay.

31:14.456 --> 31:15.291
Let's go.

31:33.267 --> 31:34.310
Almost showtime.

31:34.393 --> 31:35.394
Copy.

31:41.609 --> 31:43.235
How long does it take to decrypt?

31:43.319 --> 31:44.236
Seconds.

31:44.320 --> 31:46.947
As soon as you steal the signal,
I do my thing.

31:47.031 --> 31:48.407
Just make sure you're ready.

32:29.448 --> 32:30.282
Here he comes.

32:39.792 --> 32:42.127
How long you guys gonna be?

32:42.211 --> 32:43.295
Ninety minutes, tops.

32:43.379 --> 32:44.213
Cutting it close.

32:44.296 --> 32:45.714
Open the fuckin' gate.

32:45.798 --> 32:47.257
Anything?

32:48.550 --> 32:49.551
Not yet.

32:49.635 --> 32:51.762
You said 50 feet
this thing can grab the signal.

32:51.845 --> 32:52.763
Can you get any closer?

32:52.846 --> 32:53.972
Really?

32:54.056 --> 32:55.307
Look, man, you gotta catch this
before he drives off.

33:02.690 --> 33:04.191
-Am I good?
-Negative.

33:04.274 --> 33:05.776
Does this fucking thing even work?

33:15.869 --> 33:16.912
What now?

33:16.995 --> 33:19.415
Uh, I'm thinking.

34:19.016 --> 34:21.018
Ready for plan B?

34:21.101 --> 34:22.644
You really think you can get close enough
without getting caught?

34:22.728 --> 34:24.938
I gotta get the guards
to take the bait first.

34:25.022 --> 34:27.483
Yeah, but what if Aslan and his boys
go down in the tunnel?

34:27.566 --> 34:29.443
Then we're fucked.
We'll have to abort.

34:29.526 --> 34:31.320
I'm not blowing up anything
with people down there.

34:31.403 --> 34:32.738
So plan B has to work.

34:32.821 --> 34:34.573
There's no plan C.

34:40.996 --> 34:42.247
Set?

34:44.792 --> 34:45.626
You're clear. Go.

35:05.229 --> 35:06.146
You expecting someone?

35:07.147 --> 35:10.108
Probably a coyote.
Go check it out.

35:21.578 --> 35:22.538
They coming?

35:22.621 --> 35:24.164
They took the bait.
Hook, line, and sinker.

36:11.879 --> 36:14.715
It's nothing.
Maybe it was a coyote.

36:14.798 --> 36:16.049
Copy that.

36:30.105 --> 36:31.773
Let's get the stuff downstairs,
yeah, guys?

36:45.287 --> 36:46.955
Tell me the pipeline's down.

36:47.039 --> 36:49.124
You got 90 minutes.

36:49.207 --> 36:51.376
Nice. All right, let's do this.

36:59.927 --> 37:02.387
Shit. Intruder. Coming your way now.

37:02.471 --> 37:03.847
Hold it right there.

37:03.931 --> 37:05.474
Just a little bit closer.

37:05.557 --> 37:07.392
I said stop, pal.

37:07.476 --> 37:09.061
You understand English?

37:10.562 --> 37:11.605
Fucking stop.

37:11.688 --> 37:12.731
Just a little bit closer.

37:14.316 --> 37:16.860
Private property, asshole.
Get the fuck out of here.

37:16.944 --> 37:17.778
You got it?

37:19.154 --> 37:19.988
Got it, got it, got it.

37:20.739 --> 37:22.074
Here comes the hammer.

37:22.157 --> 37:23.742
Wrong place, wrong time.

37:23.825 --> 37:24.952
That'd be you.

37:25.035 --> 37:25.911
Boom.

37:25.994 --> 37:26.912
What'd you say?

37:36.630 --> 37:39.299
Damn, yo. Bosch, talk to me.
You good?

37:39.383 --> 37:40.842
Something like that.

37:54.982 --> 37:57.818
We slick or what?

37:57.901 --> 37:59.361
That we are.

38:16.503 --> 38:18.630
It's more than reasonable.

38:20.090 --> 38:21.925
It's less than adequate.

38:22.009 --> 38:25.262
Well, we're not going
to negotiate against ourselves.

38:28.473 --> 38:30.183
Fair enough.

38:36.523 --> 38:37.691
You kidding?

38:40.986 --> 38:42.988
Would you like to take that?

38:43.071 --> 38:44.072
It can wait.

38:45.323 --> 38:46.950
What if it's Aslan?

38:49.244 --> 38:52.414
How did you know?

38:52.497 --> 38:54.374
Answer it and find out.

39:00.088 --> 39:01.840
Yes.

39:01.923 --> 39:03.425
I'm in a meeting.

39:05.385 --> 39:06.762
When?

39:07.637 --> 39:08.972
I'll call you back.

39:09.056 --> 39:10.098
Bad news?

39:15.687 --> 39:16.730
Aslan?

39:19.524 --> 39:21.276
How will you pay them back now?

39:21.359 --> 39:22.486
What is she talking about?

39:22.569 --> 39:24.029
Shut the fuck up.

39:24.112 --> 39:26.573
You can run from the Russians,
but you can't hide.

39:26.656 --> 39:28.033
Why don't you quit
beating around the bush

39:28.116 --> 39:29.493
and tell me what you have in mind?

39:29.576 --> 39:32.913
You walk into the US Attorney's Office
and confess.

39:32.996 --> 39:34.164
To what?

39:34.247 --> 39:37.459
Witness tampering,
hiring the hitman, everything.

39:37.542 --> 39:39.586
I thought we were here
to settle the civil suit.

39:39.669 --> 39:40.837
Why would I do that?

39:41.838 --> 39:43.256
To keep breathing.

39:43.340 --> 39:44.841
What about leniency in sentencing?

39:44.925 --> 39:47.177
What does the US Attorney
say about that?

39:47.260 --> 39:49.679
You give them everything
you know about the Bratva

39:49.763 --> 39:51.515
and hope that gets you
some leniency.

39:52.516 --> 39:56.478
Either way, the Russians
won't be your problem anymore.

39:56.561 --> 39:58.522
-Carl, listen to me.
-Shut the fuck up!

40:03.860 --> 40:04.694
Deal.

40:04.778 --> 40:06.196
Good.

40:09.032 --> 40:10.450
What about the civil suit?

40:10.534 --> 40:14.913
I will take double your opening offer
and not a penny less.

40:20.669 --> 40:23.380
You give them
everything you know about the Bratva

40:23.463 --> 40:25.465
and hope that gives you
some leniency.

40:26.466 --> 40:29.469
Either way, the Russians
won't be your problem anymore.

40:29.553 --> 40:33.181
-Carl, listen to me.
-Shut the fuck up!

40:36.101 --> 40:36.935
Deal.

40:37.018 --> 40:38.103
Good.

40:49.614 --> 40:50.782
Chandler.

40:50.866 --> 40:52.450
Nicely done.

40:52.534 --> 40:53.535
Did he cave?

40:53.618 --> 40:55.036
He did.

40:55.120 --> 40:56.454
So far, so good.

40:57.455 --> 41:00.083
More to come.
Goodnight, Harry.

41:00.167 --> 41:01.168
Night.
