the disgusting state

of the world

00:47.766 --> 00:48.883
You close yourself off

facing the reality

00:51.887 --> 00:57.191
that you are all just animals

Are you on duty?

01:14.510 --> 01:15.643
No, I'm not.

01:15.711 --> 01:17.545
It's freezing out here.

01:17.613 --> 01:18.579
I said no.

01:18.647 --> 01:19.647
Please?

01:20.849 --> 01:22.550
I said I'm not on--

01:22.601 --> 01:24.585
10 years in L.A.
and I still forget

01:24.653 --> 01:27.155
that the temperature drops
20 degrees at night.

01:31.060 --> 01:33.928
I usually don't even take a taxi,
it's just the Metro stopped--

01:33.996 --> 01:34.929
Get in.

01:34.997 --> 01:36.097
What?

01:36.165 --> 01:38.866
It's ok. Get in.

01:39.868 --> 01:40.968
Thank you.

01:49.244 --> 01:51.012
I can't believe
I stumbled on to a taxi.

01:51.080 --> 01:52.630
It must be my lucky night.

02:00.856 --> 02:02.223
Very lucky.

02:14.536 --> 02:15.520
Hey, Cheryl.

03:15.631 --> 03:17.031
Sean.

03:17.099 --> 03:18.166
I was gonna call you back.

03:18.233 --> 03:20.101
I just--I got busy
on a case.

03:20.169 --> 03:23.438
Ian Boyle vanished
from prison.

03:25.007 --> 03:26.574
Interpol can't find him.

03:26.642 --> 03:29.410
What are you saying?

03:29.478 --> 03:31.245
He's off the grid, Emily.

03:31.313 --> 03:32.780
Am I in danger?

03:32.848 --> 03:34.282
We all are.

03:55.637 --> 03:57.004
Serge, you scared me.

03:57.072 --> 03:58.673
Where you been?

03:58.740 --> 04:00.641
Why are you wet?

04:00.709 --> 04:03.311
Were you out running
around in the rain?

04:23.198 --> 04:26.567
I sure did miss you,
Sergio.

04:36.712 --> 04:39.080
You're just the handsomest
kitten I've ever seen.

04:43.886 --> 04:46.754
I sure miss you
when I'm gone.

04:52.895 --> 04:55.396
Is this how
you got out, buddy?

05:14.016 --> 05:16.417
Hey, Brianna, it's Emily.

05:16.485 --> 05:17.952
Yeah, I just got back now.

05:18.020 --> 05:19.620
It was good. Thanks.

05:19.688 --> 05:24.592
Um, did you leave the fire escape window
open for Sergio to get out?

05:26.028 --> 05:27.261
Ok.

05:27.329 --> 05:29.797
No, I just--it was open
and I was wondering

05:29.865 --> 05:32.300
how it got that way.
It's fine.

05:32.367 --> 05:35.136
No. No, there's
no water damage.

05:35.203 --> 05:36.637
Um, it's fine.

05:36.705 --> 05:39.974
Thank you so much for taking care of him
while I was gone.

05:40.042 --> 05:42.476
Uh, you want to have brunch
this weekend?

05:42.544 --> 05:45.012
Ok, cool.
I'll give you a call.

05:45.080 --> 05:46.614
Ok, bye.

05:47.616 --> 05:49.417
Buddy.

05:49.484 --> 05:51.319
Ohh.

05:51.370 --> 05:52.853
Ucchh.

Her car wasn't here

08:08.996 --> 08:10.230
when I rode in

08:10.298 --> 08:12.749
I'm gonna give her a call,

Hey.

Somebody have

Garcia.

08:23.845 --> 08:24.761
Oh. Spin the wheel

08:24.846 --> 08:26.213
and it is sunny
Los Angeles, people.

08:26.280 --> 08:28.181
Two times in one year, huh?

08:28.249 --> 08:30.717
Remind me again why it's
called the City of Angels.

08:30.785 --> 08:35.222
It was originally called the town of
our lady the queen of the angels.

08:35.289 --> 08:37.557
That was a rhetorical
question, wasn't it?

08:37.625 --> 08:38.958
This is a weird one.

08:39.025 --> 08:40.360
As opposed to?

08:40.428 --> 08:42.195
Ah, withhold your
judgment, mon ami.

08:42.263 --> 08:44.063
Ok, 3 women, all abducted

08:44.131 --> 08:45.598
from different parts
of the city

08:45.650 --> 08:47.401
and murdered within
the last couple of weeks.

08:47.452 --> 08:49.369
Shelly onto,
23-year-old bank teller,

08:49.437 --> 08:50.504
15 days ago.

08:50.571 --> 08:53.106
Vickie Hagerg,
39-year-old art teacher,

08:53.174 --> 08:54.374
6 days ago.

08:54.442 --> 08:55.742
And Linda Dean,

08:55.810 --> 08:58.795
a 28-year-old hostess
at a bar, 2 days ago.

08:58.880 --> 09:00.580
All from different parts
of the city,

09:00.648 --> 09:02.315
all different
socioeconomic statuses.

09:02.383 --> 09:03.950
All 3 were held
approximately 24 hours

09:04.018 --> 09:05.585
before being dumped
in a public space.

09:05.653 --> 09:08.155
He's not hiding
what he's doing.

09:08.222 --> 09:10.657
And here's
one weird part.

09:10.725 --> 09:13.527
They all look like floaters.

09:13.594 --> 09:16.029
Mm-hmm. All 3 women
were drowned.

09:16.097 --> 09:17.597
Their bodies weren't
found anywhere near water?

09:17.648 --> 09:19.266
No, they weren't.

09:19.333 --> 09:20.867
They were drowned somewhere else
and transported to the dumpsite.

09:20.935 --> 09:22.536
Garcia, you're right,
this is weird.

09:22.603 --> 09:24.438
They weren't drowned in water.
Oh, but there's more.

09:24.489 --> 09:25.772
Methanol?

09:25.840 --> 09:27.207
Each woman had it
in her lungs

09:27.275 --> 09:28.658
and was alive
before she went into it.

09:28.743 --> 09:30.010
No water, just methanol.

09:30.077 --> 09:32.479
Drowning's a tough way
to kill someone.

09:32.530 --> 09:35.148
Slow. The unsub wants
his victims to suffer,

09:35.216 --> 09:36.650
and he's got the space

09:36.717 --> 09:38.001
and privacy
in which to do it.

09:38.085 --> 09:41.004
And if you have yet to hit
your daily allotment of skeeve

09:41.088 --> 09:42.189
before breakfast,

09:42.256 --> 09:45.175
each woman had an identical
removal of flesh

09:45.259 --> 09:47.427
taken from the bottom
of her right foot.

09:47.495 --> 09:49.529
Methanol and skin.

09:49.597 --> 09:51.898
What the hell's
he doing with them?

10:47.188 --> 10:50.257
Methanol is compositionally
speaking the simplest of the alcohols.

10:50.324 --> 10:52.442
It's actually ubiquitous
in the environment.

10:52.527 --> 10:54.594
There are small traces of
its vapor in the atmosphere,

10:54.662 --> 10:57.364
but atmospheric methanol is
easily oxidized by sunlight.

10:57.431 --> 10:59.232
Is it toxic?

10:59.300 --> 11:01.067
Ingesting 10 milliliters of it
will cause permanent blindness,

11:01.135 --> 11:02.602
and as little as 30
is potentially fatal.

11:02.670 --> 11:05.372
These victims had between 5
and 6 ounces in their lungs.

11:05.439 --> 11:06.873
You know, if they
were immersed in it,

11:06.941 --> 11:09.242
they would have died even without
ingesting or inhaling it.

11:09.310 --> 11:10.577
When absorbed
through the skin,

11:10.645 --> 11:12.095
it depresses the central
nervous system

11:12.179 --> 11:13.446
to an unsustainable
degree.

11:13.514 --> 11:14.447
Well, what's it used for?

11:14.515 --> 11:15.849
What isn't it used for?

11:15.916 --> 11:17.384
A solvent, an antifreeze.
In World War II

11:17.435 --> 11:19.219
the Germans used it
for rocket fuel.

11:19.287 --> 11:20.554
It's used in wine-making.

11:20.621 --> 11:21.721
Its most commonplace use,
however,

11:21.789 --> 11:23.223
is in the creation
of other chemicals.

11:23.291 --> 11:25.892
Methanol can become
plastic, plywood, paint,

11:25.960 --> 11:27.561
explosives,
permanent-press textiles.

11:27.612 --> 11:29.563
It's essentially the chemical
used to separate other chemicals

11:29.614 --> 11:30.564
from each other.

11:30.631 --> 11:32.532
Can it be bought?
Is it tracked?

11:32.600 --> 11:35.368
California's got some of the strictest
environmental laws in the country.

11:35.436 --> 11:36.536
I'm sure it's regulated.

11:36.604 --> 11:38.538
Yeah, but methanol
is also used in making biofuels,

11:38.606 --> 11:41.408
which quite a few people
have been doing at home.

11:41.475 --> 11:44.578
I'd imagine the sale of it
is fairly commonplace.

11:44.645 --> 11:46.446
But he needs enough in
which to immerse a body.

11:46.514 --> 11:49.683
All the victims were nude, but there's no
evidence of sexual assault on any of them.

11:49.750 --> 11:52.168
And the skin was removed
from the bottom of the foot.

11:52.253 --> 11:53.786
Unless we're talking
about a foot fetishist,

11:53.838 --> 11:56.856
you actually can't get further
away from sexual areas.

11:56.924 --> 11:58.358
Yeah. Impotent sadists
like Robert Napper

11:58.426 --> 12:00.510
typically take their frustration
out on their victims.

12:00.595 --> 12:02.195
You'd think there'd be
a lot more overkill.

12:02.263 --> 12:04.514
And what he's doing is very
specific, very focused.

12:04.599 --> 12:06.533
What about the skin patches?

12:06.601 --> 12:08.501
Is this a trophy
of some sort?

12:08.569 --> 12:10.870
I have no idea.
Skin, independent of any other substance,

12:10.938 --> 12:12.805
would wither and die
rather quickly.

12:12.857 --> 12:14.024
Well, that might be
the thing

12:14.108 --> 12:15.642
that's forcing our unsub
back out on the hunt.

12:15.710 --> 12:18.812
Considering the wide divergence
of abduction and dumpsites,

12:18.879 --> 12:21.815
this guy could be anywhere.
L.A. is over 500 square miles.

12:21.882 --> 12:23.883
Uh, 498.3.

12:23.951 --> 12:26.019
And the fact that no one has seen
him either abduct or dispose

12:26.087 --> 12:28.822
says he knows the city
and its patterns well.

12:32.693 --> 12:34.594
Day and night,

12:34.662 --> 12:36.763
it's all the same.

12:36.831 --> 12:40.266
I float around the city
bombarded by the smells

12:40.334 --> 12:42.435
of guinea pigs like you

12:42.503 --> 12:47.107
who've been swayed to toxify
themselves for corporate whoremongers,

12:47.174 --> 12:51.211
desensitizing your bodies
to the odor, the filth,

12:51.278 --> 12:56.015
the retching stench
of chemical consumption.

12:57.118 --> 12:58.201
Yes, sir.
Agent Hotchner?

12:58.285 --> 12:59.519
I'm Detective Bailey.
I'm the primary,

12:59.570 --> 13:02.022
at least until the city
starts a taskforce.

13:02.089 --> 13:03.189
It's S.O.P. in L.A.

13:03.240 --> 13:04.857
This is Agent Rossi.
Thank you for inviting us.

13:04.909 --> 13:06.025
I hope
you can help us.

13:06.077 --> 13:07.310
We'll do what we can.

13:07.378 --> 13:08.528
Doc's waiting.

13:08.596 --> 13:09.862
We got nothing here.

13:09.914 --> 13:11.665
2 of the 3 women weren't
even reported missing

13:11.732 --> 13:13.550
when we found them.
He's dumping their bodies

13:13.634 --> 13:15.502
24 hours after
abducting them.

13:15.569 --> 13:17.704
It takes longer than that
for a missing persons report

13:17.755 --> 13:18.722
to clear the system.

13:18.806 --> 13:21.541
And I have no idea
if there are more.

13:21.609 --> 13:23.176
Let's hope not.

13:24.729 --> 13:26.879
I've experimented
with the process

13:26.931 --> 13:28.398
and still been unsatisfied.

13:28.482 --> 13:29.899
I need it on my desk
first thing in the morning.

13:29.984 --> 13:32.936
The issues
are with the subjects.

13:33.020 --> 13:35.722
No, no, no, no,

13:35.790 --> 13:38.891
no, uh-uh.
91037 Wilshire.

13:38.943 --> 13:41.628
How would we ever
recapitalize from that?

13:41.696 --> 13:43.596
And if you want a future
in this company,

13:43.664 --> 13:45.265
you're gonna have to
step it up.

13:45.332 --> 13:46.916
Uh, do you not hear me?

13:47.001 --> 13:48.918
Out.
91037 Wilshire.

13:49.003 --> 13:50.370
Get out of my cab now.

13:50.438 --> 13:51.504
Excuse me?

13:51.572 --> 13:52.839
Out.
I'm gonna report this.

13:54.091 --> 13:56.342
The driver's going crazy.

13:56.410 --> 13:58.911
He's getting out
of the cab.

13:58.963 --> 14:00.246
Get out!
Ok--

14:00.314 --> 14:01.247
Get out!

14:01.298 --> 14:02.415
Ok. Ok!

14:02.466 --> 14:04.017
Get out of my cab!
Get out!

14:04.084 --> 14:06.286
Ok. Calm down!

14:08.773 --> 14:10.557
The victims
were clearly drowned,

14:10.608 --> 14:13.059
but there was absolutely
no water in their system.

14:13.110 --> 14:14.360
100% methanol.

14:14.428 --> 14:16.029
It was completely
seeped in their skin.

14:16.096 --> 14:17.597
They soaked in it
for some time.

14:17.665 --> 14:20.033
I'd say they spent
most of the time submerged,

14:20.101 --> 14:21.868
though not completely.

14:21.935 --> 14:23.737
So maybe the soaking
serves a purpose

14:23.804 --> 14:25.138
other than drowning.

14:25.206 --> 14:26.773
Could be.

14:26.841 --> 14:27.774
God.

14:27.842 --> 14:28.808
What about the wounds,

14:28.876 --> 14:30.310
the missing pieces of skin?

14:30.377 --> 14:32.412
Were the edges clean like the
unsub knew what he was doing?

14:32.463 --> 14:34.714
Actually,
on the first 2 victims,

14:34.782 --> 14:37.117
the edges of the wounds
were jagged,

14:37.184 --> 14:40.320
as if the instrument was shaking
while the skin was cut.

14:40.387 --> 14:43.807
But on the latest victim,
it's much cleaner,

14:43.891 --> 14:45.558
much more defined.

14:45.626 --> 14:48.361
His confidence and skill
level are increasing.

14:49.797 --> 14:51.898
I don't imagine you need
any medical training

14:51.966 --> 14:53.066
for something like that.

14:53.134 --> 14:55.602
No, just something
sharp enough.

14:55.669 --> 14:56.903
Doctor, was there
any methanol in the wound?

14:56.971 --> 14:58.104
Excuse me?

14:58.172 --> 14:59.739
In the wound itself,
was there evidence of methanol?

14:59.807 --> 15:01.407
Only trace amounts.

15:01.475 --> 15:04.511
So the skin was removed after the
body was taken out of the chemical?

15:04.578 --> 15:07.413
Postmortem. It's not about
torture or pain.

15:07.481 --> 15:10.350
Oh, one other thing.
I noticed in the toxicology report

15:10.417 --> 15:12.819
that Ms. Dean had a good amount
of chloroform in her blood.

15:12.887 --> 15:14.521
It turns out the other
victims did as well.

15:14.588 --> 15:16.656
If he were using chloroform,
wouldn't she have burning

15:16.707 --> 15:18.258
around her nose and mouth?

15:18.325 --> 15:19.859
Usually. None of them
showed any signs of it,

15:19.927 --> 15:21.961
but there is burning
inside her nostrils.

15:22.012 --> 15:23.997
She breathed
the chloroform in.

15:24.064 --> 15:27.467
What if he aerosolized
to turn it into a mist?

15:27.535 --> 15:28.468
That could do it.

15:28.536 --> 15:31.371
That's pretty extensive
preplanning.

15:33.107 --> 15:35.975
Repulsive.

15:36.026 --> 15:39.512
Nasty, stinking, rotten,

15:39.563 --> 15:41.698
filthy creatures.

15:46.787 --> 15:49.372
Guys, as I feared, methanol
can be easily purchased

15:49.456 --> 15:51.875
from any chemical supply house
in Southern California.

15:51.959 --> 15:55.044
It's not controlled. You can buy it in
large quantities or small quantities.

15:55.129 --> 15:57.881
Now, I've charted the
abduction and disposal sites.

15:57.965 --> 16:00.133
Linda Dean was taken
from Hollywood.

16:00.200 --> 16:02.001
Her body was dumped
in Echo Park.

16:02.052 --> 16:04.203
Shelly onto was last seen
in the garment district.

16:04.255 --> 16:05.839
Her body was dumped
in Sherman Oaks.

16:05.890 --> 16:08.558
And finally, Vickie Hagerg was taken
in Torrance south of the city.

16:08.642 --> 16:10.910
Her body
was left in Westlake.

16:10.978 --> 16:12.145
It's a huge
geographical area.

16:12.213 --> 16:13.980
The only area the unsub
hasn't hit yet

16:14.048 --> 16:16.182
is east of downtown, which means
we can either eliminate it

16:16.250 --> 16:17.650
or it's the one place left.

16:17.718 --> 16:18.985
So we're back
to nothing.

16:19.053 --> 16:20.653
No, not necessarily.
I looked at the crime scene photos.

16:20.721 --> 16:22.856
These sites are true dumpsites.

16:22.923 --> 16:24.858
I mean, there's no concealment,
no staging.

16:24.909 --> 16:27.827
He literally just dumps the bodies there
like garbage once he's done with them.

16:27.895 --> 16:30.496
The randomness could be orchestrated
or it could be simple opportunity.

16:30.564 --> 16:32.031
Either way,
he's very mobile.

16:32.099 --> 16:33.700
All of the dumpsites, including
the most recent one,

16:33.751 --> 16:35.869
are between the 110
and 405 freeway

16:35.936 --> 16:37.570
and the 5 and 10
north and south.

16:37.621 --> 16:39.205
Linda Dean's family
said she always

16:39.273 --> 16:41.007
took the Red Line home
from work at night,

16:41.074 --> 16:43.376
but the subway in L.A.
stops running at 1 a.m.

16:43.444 --> 16:45.912
She clocked out of work
at 5 past 1:00.

16:45.980 --> 16:47.947
L.A. at 1 a.m.?
She probably didn't walk home.

16:48.015 --> 16:50.183
No. And Kingsley's
a mile away.

16:50.251 --> 16:52.352
All the victims had breathed
an aerosolized chloroform,

16:52.419 --> 16:53.887
and to do that
he needs an enclosed space.

16:53.954 --> 16:55.955
You know, chloroform's a lot
more controlled than methanol.

16:56.023 --> 16:58.258
I'll have Garcia track any large
quantity purchases or thefts

16:58.325 --> 16:59.809
from chemical supply houses.

16:59.894 --> 17:01.661
So we're looking for
a vehicle,

17:01.729 --> 17:03.763
one that could be
in any area of Los Angeles

17:03.831 --> 17:06.531
at 1:00 in the morning
and not attract attention.

17:06.599 --> 17:08.935
I hate to say it, but that
could be a police car.

17:09.002 --> 17:10.653
Or a taxi.

17:18.345 --> 17:20.012
Hi.

17:21.147 --> 17:24.717
I am going to--

17:24.785 --> 17:26.352
where is my address?

17:26.420 --> 17:28.354
Hey, how do you say this--

17:28.422 --> 17:29.589
ca-hu-enga.

17:29.657 --> 17:30.857
Cahuenga.

17:30.925 --> 17:32.892
Does it connect--

17:32.960 --> 17:35.161
can I just give this to you?

17:40.434 --> 17:41.935
Thank you.

17:42.002 --> 17:43.820
It really...

17:48.676 --> 17:51.177
No, it's ok. I got you.

17:56.884 --> 17:58.351
I got you.

18:04.091 --> 18:06.175
Uh, sir--

18:06.260 --> 18:08.227
Sir, there's something--

18:08.295 --> 18:10.897
Sir, there's something--

18:10.965 --> 18:12.131
Sir--

18:12.182 --> 18:14.017
Sir, please open the door!

18:14.101 --> 18:16.502
Sir--sir, please op--

18:16.553 --> 18:20.073
sir, I can't get out!
Please, open the door!

19:04.517 --> 19:07.652
Live from Quantico, Va,
it is the divine Miss Penelope.

19:07.720 --> 19:10.422
Los Angeles, you're our first
and favorite caller.

19:10.489 --> 19:11.539
Talk to me.

19:11.624 --> 19:13.658
Ok, woman, you do know
you're crazy, right?

19:13.709 --> 19:15.760
Mm-hmm. But like you always say,
don't hate the Playa,

19:15.828 --> 19:16.928
hate the game.

19:16.996 --> 19:18.930
Ok, Playa, my bad.

19:18.997 --> 19:21.099
Listen, I need you to check
and see which cab companies

19:21.167 --> 19:23.835
serve the Hollywood area where
Linda dean was abducted.

19:26.038 --> 19:28.106
There are 7--
Bell, Beverly Hills,

19:28.174 --> 19:31.659
Checker, City, Independent, United,
and the Yellow cab company.

19:31.744 --> 19:33.611
Can you narrow that down and
find out who picked up fares

19:33.679 --> 19:35.980
near Vaughn's bar and grill
in the the last 72 hours?

19:36.048 --> 19:37.415
That's gonna take
a minute or two,

19:37.483 --> 19:39.417
but still no cause
for perspiration.

19:39.485 --> 19:41.653
I shall lovingly hit you back
when I have something, ok?

19:41.720 --> 19:42.821
Thanks, Playa.

19:42.888 --> 19:44.322
You know it.

19:44.390 --> 19:46.324
There's 7 companies.
Garcia's running them down.

19:46.375 --> 19:47.509
Good.

19:47.593 --> 19:49.194
Most taxis here
run out of cab stands.

19:49.261 --> 19:50.962
It's not like New York where they're
running all over the place.

19:51.013 --> 19:52.830
That should help
narrow down the choices.

19:52.882 --> 19:54.365
Excuse me.

20:15.287 --> 20:16.554
What do you got?

20:16.622 --> 20:18.056
Ok, I checked all 7
cab companies

20:18.124 --> 20:19.924
that service the Hollywood
and Vermont area,

20:19.992 --> 20:21.993
and none of the drivers
reported picking anyone up

20:22.044 --> 20:23.895
between 11:00 and 2:00
the night Linda went missing.

20:23.963 --> 20:25.563
And they know that
for sure?

20:25.631 --> 20:26.998
Yeah. They seemed
really certain.

20:27.066 --> 20:28.666
Well, one of the drivers
may have picked someone up

20:28.734 --> 20:29.701
off the meter.

20:29.768 --> 20:31.369
The cabs have GPS?

20:31.437 --> 20:33.438
Yeah. Taxis are tracked
more than Gaga's Twitter.

20:33.506 --> 20:35.006
What does that mean?

20:35.074 --> 20:36.558
I'll explain it to him,
Garcia.

20:36.642 --> 20:39.043
Yeah, teach him to worship
the other Lady G, boss.

20:39.111 --> 20:40.912
Ta and ta.

20:40.980 --> 20:43.581
So there were no taxis
in the area.

20:47.453 --> 20:50.788
Add 5 tablespoons
of salt.

20:50.856 --> 20:53.908
Once the animal skin
has boiled long enough

20:53.993 --> 20:56.661
to render all the fat possible,

20:56.729 --> 20:59.964
strain it into
the double-boiling pot

21:00.032 --> 21:02.500
with the nitric acid.

21:02.568 --> 21:05.336
Allow the solution to cool.

21:05.404 --> 21:09.941
This should create
a clear, beautiful mixture

21:10.009 --> 21:13.411
with a natural scent.

21:13.479 --> 21:15.647
What about a gypsy cab?

21:15.714 --> 21:17.649
They roam around in
unregistered vehicles

21:17.716 --> 21:20.635
with fake insignias
that look legit.

21:20.719 --> 21:23.271
There are 2,300
registered cabs in the city

21:23.355 --> 21:24.755
and at least as many
unregistered.

21:24.807 --> 21:27.308
And no one pays any attention
when they get into a cab.

21:27.393 --> 21:30.311
If he's unregistered, he's not
gonna sit outside taxi stands

21:30.396 --> 21:32.931
and wait to pick up fares
in the traditional way.

21:32.998 --> 21:34.265
Which makes him
either harder to find.

21:34.333 --> 21:35.433
This guy could be anywhere.

21:35.484 --> 21:36.668
Detective,
can you gather everyone?

21:36.735 --> 21:37.802
We'd like to give the profile.

21:37.870 --> 21:39.204
Thank you.
Yeah.

21:45.211 --> 21:46.244
What is it, Reid?

21:46.295 --> 21:47.245
When I was in school,
we used to use methanol

21:47.296 --> 21:48.947
to separate chemicals
from each other.

21:49.014 --> 21:51.516
Whatever we did, we'd clip a
sample of the source material

21:51.584 --> 21:53.651
to label and keep
next to the output.

21:53.719 --> 21:54.786
What kind of samples?

21:54.853 --> 21:56.621
Square samples
2 inches by 2 inches.

21:56.672 --> 21:59.724
I think this guy's a scientist
and he's experimenting.

22:06.899 --> 22:08.233
You're awake.

22:33.592 --> 22:35.426
You're awake.

23:03.656 --> 23:05.690
You're gonna live forever.

23:18.075 --> 23:20.482
We wanted to get a preliminary
profile to you as soon as possible

23:20.524 --> 23:22.458
because of the type of unsub
we're dealing with here.

23:22.526 --> 23:24.294
We believe
he's a male caucasian,

23:24.361 --> 23:26.729
driving an unregistered
gypsy cab.

23:26.797 --> 23:28.831
He uses the vehicle
to abduct the women.

23:28.899 --> 23:30.667
His victims have been between
the ages of 20 and 40,

23:30.734 --> 23:33.002
and we think that he's
in the same age bracket.

23:33.053 --> 23:35.138
Add to that his use of
methanol for whatever reason

23:35.205 --> 23:37.140
and the aerosolization
of chloroform,

23:37.207 --> 23:39.509
and we believe that we're looking
for a very intelligent unsub.

23:39.576 --> 23:41.678
Which is not unusual.
True psychopaths

23:41.729 --> 23:43.579
often have above-average
intelligence.

23:43.647 --> 23:46.399
This type of unsub will
not have injected himself

23:46.483 --> 23:48.584
into the investigation
as we often see.

23:48.652 --> 23:51.587
He will not be following the
investigation very closely.

23:51.655 --> 23:53.589
In fact, he may
not even be concerned

23:53.657 --> 23:55.525
about whether
he's leaving any evidence.

23:55.592 --> 23:56.743
So how come
we can't find him?

23:56.827 --> 23:57.894
Because of what
he's doing to them.

23:57.961 --> 23:59.412
He's submerging them
in liquid,

23:59.496 --> 24:01.414
which is washing away any forensic
evidence which might be there.

24:01.498 --> 24:03.533
And then he's wrapping
the bodies in plastic.

24:03.584 --> 24:05.668
There is something about him
which will be helpful.

24:05.736 --> 24:07.170
He's extremely antisocial.

24:07.237 --> 24:08.588
We've all
heard neighbors say

24:08.672 --> 24:11.090
after an unsub is caught
how surprised they all are.

24:11.175 --> 24:12.875
That will not be the case
with this guy.

24:12.943 --> 24:16.879
Couple his explosive,
antisocial nature with taxi-driving

24:16.930 --> 24:19.916
and someone will have
made contact with him.

24:19.983 --> 24:21.384
They will remember.

24:21.452 --> 24:23.770
We suggest going public with the
information as soon as possible,

24:23.854 --> 24:25.722
that he's an unregistered
taxi driver

24:25.773 --> 24:28.024
and that he's had confrontations
with people in the city.

24:28.092 --> 24:29.359
Thank you very much.

24:31.662 --> 24:33.946
Someone
has had a confrontation

24:34.031 --> 24:36.282
with this man, most likely
involving his taxi,

24:36.367 --> 24:37.633
which is not registered.

24:37.701 --> 24:39.118
Now, if you have,
please contact...

24:39.203 --> 24:41.404
You guys got a press
conference up fast.

24:41.472 --> 24:43.473
And we'd like to warn
everyone in the community,

24:43.540 --> 24:46.075
especially women
who travel alone...

24:46.143 --> 24:48.211
The body's this way.
People need to know.

24:52.983 --> 24:56.169
A couple of
Mountain-bikers found her.

24:56.253 --> 24:57.754
Same story.

24:57.805 --> 24:59.806
Yeah.

24:59.890 --> 25:01.691
She's still unidentified,
but like I said,

25:01.759 --> 25:05.294
most of this guy's victims
weren't even reported missing.

25:05.362 --> 25:07.764
Garcia, what we're looking for
is a combination of purchases.

25:07.815 --> 25:10.967
Ooh, combinations of lists
are my life's work and forte,

25:11.034 --> 25:12.435
oh, tall and smart one. Go.

25:12.503 --> 25:14.437
Items used to set up
a laboratory--

25:14.488 --> 25:15.772
beakers, glass tubing,

25:15.823 --> 25:17.273
a vessel large enough
to hold a woman,

25:17.324 --> 25:19.142
enough methanol
to submerge her.

25:19.209 --> 25:20.476
Yeah. Added to?

25:20.544 --> 25:21.944
Addresses where large
amounts of methanol

25:22.012 --> 25:23.880
have been delivered
alongside chloroform.

25:23.947 --> 25:25.281
I shall contact you
forthwith.

25:25.349 --> 25:27.500
I will eagerly
be awaiting your call.

25:27.584 --> 25:29.952
Dr. Reid, where'd the guy go
who gave the press conference?

25:30.003 --> 25:31.120
He's with the reporters. Why?

25:31.171 --> 25:32.622
Because we already
got someone calling

25:32.673 --> 25:34.173
who says she talked
to the guy.

25:36.727 --> 25:39.162
I don't know if he's the guy,
but he was out of control.

25:39.229 --> 25:40.997
His cab was unregistered,

25:41.064 --> 25:43.866
and he actually made me,
a paying customer, get out.

25:43.934 --> 25:45.184
Ok, was that all
that happened?

25:45.269 --> 25:46.569
Well, I was on the phone

25:46.637 --> 25:49.071
when I first
got in the cab.

25:49.139 --> 25:51.307
Uh, yeah, he was listening
to something.

25:51.375 --> 25:52.508
What do you mean?

25:52.576 --> 25:54.877
Some dumb recording
of himself talking.

25:54.945 --> 25:56.646
What was he saying
on the recording?

25:56.697 --> 25:59.882
I don't know.
I tried to get his cab number down,

25:59.950 --> 26:01.150
but I was really flustered.

26:01.201 --> 26:02.985
I only got
the last 2 digits.

26:03.053 --> 26:05.905
Ok, ma'am, these two officers will
take down all your information.

26:05.989 --> 26:07.957
They're probably gonna ask
you to look at some photos.

26:08.025 --> 26:09.992
How long is that gonna take?

26:10.060 --> 26:12.128
I'm not really sure, ma'am,

26:12.196 --> 26:15.231
but you may actually
help save someone's life.

26:15.299 --> 26:16.899
Ok.

26:20.337 --> 26:22.939
All right, if he's listening
to recordings of himself,

26:23.006 --> 26:26.442
he's not only antisocial, he's
probably delusional as well.

26:27.761 --> 26:29.378
Thank you.

26:29.429 --> 26:30.813
Agent Hotchner.

26:32.516 --> 26:33.950
I'll call you back.

26:34.017 --> 26:35.601
A young girl, Anisa Gold,

26:35.669 --> 26:37.270
just went missing
this afternoon.

26:37.337 --> 26:39.772
Her roommate says she was going to
a job interview, never arrived.

26:39.840 --> 26:42.275
She never returned home
either.

26:42.342 --> 26:43.609
He probably has her, right?

26:43.677 --> 26:45.194
Probably.

26:47.614 --> 26:50.232
We're with the FBI.
You mind if we take a look

26:50.284 --> 26:51.784
inside your cab
for a minute?

26:51.869 --> 26:53.903
It doesn't have anything
to do with you, sir.

26:53.971 --> 26:55.905
We just want to have
a conversation.

26:55.973 --> 26:58.240
Well...Ok. Sure.

26:58.292 --> 26:59.241
Thank you.

26:59.293 --> 27:01.243
Ok.
Prentiss, hop in the back.

27:01.295 --> 27:03.596
You're welcome.
Thank you.

27:11.471 --> 27:13.422
So why a cab?

27:13.473 --> 27:15.591
He could control
the woman better

27:15.642 --> 27:17.092
if he had
a van or something.

27:17.144 --> 27:20.763
Yeah, but a woman probably wouldn't
get into a van voluntarily.

27:20.814 --> 27:23.900
A cab enables him to blend in
when he's on the hunt.

27:25.152 --> 27:27.770
He doesn't choose his victims
until they get inside.

27:27.838 --> 27:30.907
Right. So what is it
about these passengers?

27:33.343 --> 27:34.944
Well, I doubt
it's anything visual.

27:35.012 --> 27:36.629
He'd get a better look
at his victims from the street

27:36.713 --> 27:38.297
as opposed to the back
of his cab.

27:40.717 --> 27:41.951
Partition.

27:42.019 --> 27:43.286
They aren't touching
each other.

27:43.353 --> 27:44.754
Probably isn't based on that.

27:47.257 --> 27:49.292
Hearing? Something they say?

27:53.630 --> 27:55.531
Prentiss.

27:55.599 --> 27:57.400
What's going on with you?

27:57.467 --> 27:58.734
With me?

27:58.802 --> 28:00.403
I've been watching you
the last couple of days

28:00.470 --> 28:02.471
and something is obviously
bothering you.

28:04.308 --> 28:06.409
Derek, because I like you,

28:06.476 --> 28:08.377
I'm going to ask you
not to do this.

28:08.445 --> 28:10.179
Please.

28:15.369 --> 28:16.953
Ugh. It smells back here.

28:27.965 --> 28:28.998
Hey.

28:29.049 --> 28:30.633
Could it be smell?

28:30.684 --> 28:31.634
What?

28:31.702 --> 28:33.269
Could smell be what's
attracting him

28:33.337 --> 28:34.503
to his victims?

28:34.571 --> 28:36.973
Distillation extraction.

28:37.024 --> 28:40.175
Well, I hope you know what you
just said, 'cause you lost me.

28:40.227 --> 28:42.311
Methanol can be used
to create scents or aromas.

28:42.362 --> 28:43.729
If you soak something
in it for hours,

28:43.814 --> 28:45.197
it draws out
the essential oils.

28:45.282 --> 28:47.149
Emily, let me call you
right back, ok?

28:48.552 --> 28:51.187
The natural essence
of a woman

28:51.254 --> 28:55.057
is innocent
and intoxicating.

28:55.125 --> 28:59.078
It must be preserved
by any means necessary.

28:59.162 --> 29:02.898
The mixtures from subjects
1 through 4 were flawed,

29:02.966 --> 29:07.236
but subject 5
is more fearful.

29:07.304 --> 29:11.741
Her pheromones
will yield better results.

29:26.723 --> 29:29.075
Subject 5, shh...

29:29.159 --> 29:31.610
Please...

29:31.695 --> 29:33.996
Please, just let me go.

29:34.064 --> 29:35.998
I'm not number 5.
My name's Anisa.

29:36.066 --> 29:38.067
Please let me go.

29:38.118 --> 29:39.502
Let you go?

29:39.569 --> 29:42.638
I've perfected the process.

29:42.706 --> 29:44.507
Everything is ready.

29:45.609 --> 29:48.210
Please. Please...

29:54.313 --> 29:56.964
Unless the victims all wore excessive
amounts of perfume,

29:57.139 --> 29:59.891
it would take a hell of nose to detect
smell through a taxi window.

29:59.975 --> 30:01.059
Not necessarily.

30:01.143 --> 30:03.411
People with the olfactory
disorder hyperosmia

30:03.479 --> 30:05.547
have an oversensitivity
to smell.

30:05.614 --> 30:07.582
They typically pick up scents
that other people can't.

30:07.650 --> 30:10.485
I don't think he'd be going after their perfume.
It's already artificial.

30:10.553 --> 30:13.254
So they probably weren't
wearing anything on their skin.

30:13.322 --> 30:15.590
Something about their
natural scent compels him?

30:15.658 --> 30:17.058
Smell's a powerful
trigger for memory.

30:17.126 --> 30:20.228
He might be trying to bring back
the memory of somebody he lost.

30:20.296 --> 30:21.730
Excuse me.

30:21.797 --> 30:23.164
You have something?

30:23.232 --> 30:25.100
Yeah, this is wonderful
and totally uncommon.

30:25.167 --> 30:26.584
I have exactly one address

30:26.669 --> 30:28.903
at which every piece of equipment
you listed was delivered to.

30:28.971 --> 30:30.638
We have an address.

30:33.008 --> 30:34.442
Subject number 5,

30:34.510 --> 30:37.595
this part is up to you,

30:37.680 --> 30:42.083
but, as you know, I've done
several of these, well...

30:42.151 --> 30:44.886
Extractions, and...

30:44.954 --> 30:48.089
It would be better for you
if you just take a deep breath

30:48.157 --> 30:50.258
as soon as
you're submerged.

30:50.326 --> 30:53.528
Fighting will only
prolong your discomfort.

30:54.830 --> 30:56.097
But, again,

30:56.165 --> 30:59.634
it's totally up to you.

30:59.702 --> 31:02.620
All right, here we go.

31:02.705 --> 31:04.906
Oh, God, no.

31:04.974 --> 31:08.209
No, please,
don't do this.

31:08.277 --> 31:10.378
No! No, please...

31:10.446 --> 31:13.748
Don't! No!

31:22.675 --> 31:24.359
Morgan and Prentiss,
take the back.

31:29.298 --> 31:31.483
He's got eyes on us.

31:31.567 --> 31:32.901
FBI!

31:38.908 --> 31:41.309
He's running!

31:41.377 --> 31:43.611
Reid and Prentiss,
search the house.

31:56.792 --> 31:58.092
There!

32:15.044 --> 32:16.077
FBI!

32:16.145 --> 32:18.146
Please help me!

32:18.197 --> 32:19.898
Help me!

32:21.901 --> 32:23.151
Are you ok?
Clear!

32:23.219 --> 32:25.069
Yes, just get me out.

32:25.154 --> 32:26.454
I got it.

32:28.157 --> 32:29.290
You're ok.

32:29.358 --> 32:31.192
You're ok.

32:31.243 --> 32:32.860
It's all right.
We're gonna get you out of here.

32:32.912 --> 32:34.862
Thank you.

32:36.999 --> 32:38.633
Thank you.

33:28.217 --> 33:30.518
Damn it!
We lost him.

33:30.586 --> 33:31.986
Split up.

34:01.050 --> 34:02.183
Stop.

34:02.251 --> 34:04.502
Back up.

34:07.756 --> 34:08.889
Got him.

34:57.940 --> 35:00.174
No.

35:00.242 --> 35:01.726
No!

35:08.117 --> 35:11.569
...Rotted vegetables,
rotted fruit, rotted meat,

35:11.654 --> 35:13.071
rotted lives.

35:13.155 --> 35:14.522
It's not that it's hidden.

35:14.573 --> 35:16.324
It's everywhere.

35:16.375 --> 35:18.543
You don't notice
because you don't want to.

35:18.627 --> 35:22.430
You close yourself off
to it, pretend it isn't there

35:22.498 --> 35:27.051
because it's easier
than facing it,

35:27.136 --> 35:30.922
facing the reality that
you're all just animals

35:31.006 --> 35:34.308
pretending to be something more.

35:45.187 --> 35:48.156
"Nothing revives
the past so completely

35:48.223 --> 35:51.025
as a smell that was once
associated with it."

35:51.093 --> 35:54.829
Novelist Vladimir Nabakov.

36:43.846 --> 36:44.812
Reid?

36:44.880 --> 36:46.948
Emily, you are not
going to believe this.

36:47.015 --> 36:48.816
No?

36:48.884 --> 36:50.334
They're showing "Solaris"
tonight, the original,

36:50.419 --> 36:51.519
in the theaters.
You want to go?

36:51.587 --> 36:53.521
Did Morgan
put you up to this?

36:53.589 --> 36:54.689
What?

36:54.757 --> 36:56.424
Did Morgan tell you
to call me?

36:56.492 --> 36:58.192
No, Morgan would have no idea
what "Solaris" is.

36:58.260 --> 37:02.864
So, uh, you just called me
out of the blue.

37:02.931 --> 37:04.465
Well, I mean, the original
one's in Russian,

37:04.516 --> 37:06.701
so, really, you and I are the only
ones that can really enjoy it.

37:06.769 --> 37:09.437
Isn't "Solaris"
like 4 hours long?

37:09.505 --> 37:12.039
It's 5. The best Sci-Fi
meditation film of all time.

37:12.107 --> 37:14.509
But for some reason, they never
really show it in the theaters.

37:14.576 --> 37:15.877
You want to go with me?

37:15.944 --> 37:19.380
Sorry, handsome.
I'm gonna have to pass.

37:19.448 --> 37:21.649
I'm just gonna hang out
with Sergio tonight.

37:21.717 --> 37:23.534
Oh, shoot.
I didn't realize that...

37:23.619 --> 37:25.219
Relax, Reid.

37:25.287 --> 37:27.171
Sergio is my new cat.

37:27.256 --> 37:29.056
But, um...

37:29.124 --> 37:30.158
Thank you.

37:30.225 --> 37:32.093
For what?

37:32.160 --> 37:33.544
For being you.

37:33.629 --> 37:34.662
Aw, thanks.

37:34.730 --> 37:36.230
I don't know how
to be anyone else.

37:36.298 --> 37:37.498
Yeah.

37:37.549 --> 37:40.902
That's what I love
about you.

37:40.969 --> 37:42.503
Bye.

38:21.610 --> 38:23.044
Monsieur...

38:26.431 --> 38:28.733
Merci.

38:44.449 --> 38:46.083
Qu'est-ce qui se passe?

38:46.168 --> 38:49.170
I want to talk to Sean.

39:05.754 --> 39:07.188
They got her.

39:07.255 --> 39:09.357
Drop the phone.
Get on the ground now.

39:09.424 --> 39:12.560
Based on their shoes
and shades, I'd say CIA.

39:12.628 --> 39:15.363
But it could be MI5,
ICC, Interpol.

39:15.430 --> 39:18.199
Hey! I'm not gonna tell you again.
On the ground--now!

39:18.267 --> 39:19.934
Hold on.

39:20.936 --> 39:22.203
Kill me or arrest me,

39:22.271 --> 39:25.373
but I will not lay on
the ground like a dog.

39:26.775 --> 39:27.875
I gotta go.

39:27.943 --> 39:30.711
Stay on top of this.
I'll speak to you soon.

39:55.136 --> 39:57.004
Serge?

39:57.072 --> 39:59.373
Sergio, buddy.

40:01.610 --> 40:02.610
Hey.
