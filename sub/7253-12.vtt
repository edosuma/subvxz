00:00.876 --> 00:01.669
<i>Previously on "Gilmore Girls.."</i>

00:01.710 --> 00:03.002
Luke, will you marry me?

00:03.044 --> 00:04.463
Yes.

00:04.505 --> 00:05.840
And it should be fully restored

00:04.505 --> 00:05.840
and working by June third.

00:05.881 --> 00:07.382
which by the way,

00:05.881 --> 00:07.382
is the date of our wedding.

00:07.424 --> 00:09.134
June third? We've to

00:07.424 --> 00:09.134
tell each other everything.

00:09.176 --> 00:10.552
Agreed.

00:10.594 --> 00:12.137
That's the only way

00:10.594 --> 00:12.137
this is gonna work.

00:12.179 --> 00:14.974
I'm going to take hair samples

00:12.179 --> 00:14.974
from three men, run DNA tests

00:15.015 --> 00:16.308
on them, and figure out

00:15.015 --> 00:16.308
which one's my father.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.435
I'm sorry.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.435
Did you say<i> your</i> father?

00:18.477 --> 00:20.980
- I've got a kid.

00:18.477 --> 00:20.980
- What did Lorelai say?

00:22.439 --> 00:24.065
You haven't told her.

00:24.107 --> 00:26.485
I want to talk to her

00:24.107 --> 00:26.485
and see her on a regular basis.

00:26.527 --> 00:27.653
Okay.

00:27.695 --> 00:29.279
- I got a job!

00:27.695 --> 00:29.279
- What! Where?

00:29.321 --> 00:30.823
At the Stamford Gazette.

00:30.865 --> 00:32.574
- Yes!

00:30.865 --> 00:32.574
- And I'm going back to Yale.

00:32.616 --> 00:35.202
You don't get to care about

00:32.616 --> 00:35.202
where I live anymore, Logan.

00:35.243 --> 00:36.954
- You broke up with me.

00:35.243 --> 00:36.954
- Honor was bugging me.

00:36.996 --> 00:38.413
And I just told her

00:36.996 --> 00:38.413
we broke up to shut her up.

00:38.455 --> 00:40.290
- I need some time.

00:38.455 --> 00:40.290
- You're a coward.

00:40.332 --> 00:42.125
Rory, I love you.

00:42.167 --> 00:45.295
I have an appointment.

00:42.167 --> 00:45.295
I have to go.

00:54.638 --> 00:55.639
[bell tolls]

00:55.681 --> 00:56.682
- Oh, my God!

00:55.681 --> 00:56.682
- What is that?

00:56.724 --> 00:57.766
What is it? Is it in the house?

00:57.808 --> 00:59.184
Yeah, it's church bells.

00:59.226 --> 01:00.602
How'd the church bells

00:59.226 --> 01:00.602
get in the house?

01:00.644 --> 01:02.396
- They're outside.

01:00.644 --> 01:02.396
- In the yard?

01:02.437 --> 01:04.356
No, at the church.

01:02.437 --> 01:04.356
What time is it?

01:04.398 --> 01:06.525
It's 3:12.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.777
Why are the church bells

01:06.567 --> 01:08.777
ringing at 3:12?

01:08.819 --> 01:10.654
You know,

01:08.819 --> 01:10.654
I was having a dream, too.

01:10.696 --> 01:14.115
I was shopping for a car and

01:10.696 --> 01:14.115
I wanted to see the trunk space

01:14.157 --> 01:16.243
'cause I have a truck and it's

01:14.157 --> 01:16.243
convenient to haul things.

01:16.284 --> 01:18.078
So I wanted to see what

01:16.284 --> 01:18.078
the deal with the car was

01:18.119 --> 01:20.414
and the salesman opened it, I

01:18.119 --> 01:20.414
asked him how many cubic feet

01:20.455 --> 01:23.417
it was and he looked it up in

01:20.455 --> 01:23.417
the manual and I was satisfied.

01:23.458 --> 01:26.003
So when he closed the hood,

01:23.458 --> 01:26.003
the bells rang.

01:26.045 --> 01:28.005
You have very mundane dreams.

01:28.047 --> 01:29.924
(male #1)

01:28.047 --> 01:29.924
'Town meeting, town meeting.'

01:29.965 --> 01:32.593
- What was that?

01:29.965 --> 01:32.593
- Dead guy yelling something.

01:32.634 --> 01:34.177
Ghosts are yelling something

01:32.634 --> 01:34.177
outside the house?

01:34.219 --> 01:37.514
No, guys I'm gonna kill

01:34.219 --> 01:37.514
yelling stuff outside the house.

01:37.556 --> 01:39.474
- 'Town meeting.'

01:37.556 --> 01:39.474
- What are they saying?

01:39.516 --> 01:41.685
- There was a clown beating?

01:39.516 --> 01:41.685
- Not again.

01:41.727 --> 01:43.938
- 'Town meeting.'

01:43.979 --> 01:45.981
No, they're saying,

01:43.979 --> 01:45.981
"Town meeting."

01:46.023 --> 01:48.067
Town meeting? At this hour?

01:48.108 --> 01:50.027
What the hell

01:48.108 --> 01:50.027
is Taylor up to?

01:50.069 --> 01:51.904
- Alright. Guess we better go.

01:50.069 --> 01:51.904
- Let's get back to sleep.

01:51.946 --> 01:53.781
What?

01:51.946 --> 01:53.781
I'm going back to bed.

01:53.822 --> 01:55.908
You can't go back to sleep.

01:53.822 --> 01:55.908
Come on, it's a town meeting.

01:55.950 --> 01:57.117
It's the middle

01:55.950 --> 01:57.117
of the night.

01:57.158 --> 01:58.953
Oh, sorry, we might

01:57.158 --> 01:58.953
miss something.

01:58.994 --> 02:00.161
[laughs]

02:03.958 --> 02:05.667
Oh, good. Full house.

02:05.709 --> 02:08.420
Just goes to show how easily

02:05.709 --> 02:08.420
manipulated we all are.

02:08.462 --> 02:10.255
You ring a bell,

02:08.462 --> 02:10.255
we drool like dogs.

02:10.297 --> 02:12.674
Just don't drool where we sit.

02:10.297 --> 02:12.674
It'll be messy.

02:12.716 --> 02:13.968
Hey, you guys hear

02:12.716 --> 02:13.968
the bells?

02:14.009 --> 02:16.344
No, we were just on one

02:14.009 --> 02:16.344
of our spontaneous

02:16.386 --> 02:18.138
three-in-the-morning strolls,

02:16.386 --> 02:18.138
saw everybody in here

02:18.179 --> 02:19.347
and wondered, hey, what's up?

02:19.389 --> 02:20.682
- Really?

02:19.389 --> 02:20.682
- No.

02:20.724 --> 02:22.059
He's cranky

02:20.724 --> 02:22.059
at 3:00 in the morning.

02:22.101 --> 02:23.268
Any idea

02:22.101 --> 02:23.268
what this is about?

02:23.310 --> 02:24.812
No, Taylor's

02:23.310 --> 02:24.812
not even here yet.

02:24.853 --> 02:26.688
Kirk's up there,

02:24.853 --> 02:26.688
futzing with something

02:26.730 --> 02:28.107
but he won't tell us

02:26.730 --> 02:28.107
what's going on.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.275
We're just about ready

02:28.148 --> 02:30.275
here, folks.

02:30.317 --> 02:31.777
Ready for what?

02:30.317 --> 02:31.777
What is this?

02:31.819 --> 02:33.153
Here we go.

02:34.529 --> 02:35.781
Greetings, everyone.

02:35.823 --> 02:37.783
- 'Taylor?'

02:35.823 --> 02:37.783
- He's in a little box.

02:37.825 --> 02:39.493
The nightmare continues.

02:39.534 --> 02:40.911
Is it looking okay, Kirk?

02:40.953 --> 02:42.830
Yeah, you could use

02:40.953 --> 02:42.830
a little pancake.

02:42.871 --> 02:44.999
Weird. I can still smell

02:42.871 --> 02:44.999
his cologne.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.667
People, we have

02:45.040 --> 02:46.667
a tremendous problem

02:46.708 --> 02:48.376
that needs

02:46.708 --> 02:48.376
our immediate attention.

02:48.418 --> 02:50.295
That's why I chose

02:48.418 --> 02:50.295
the extraordinary step

02:50.337 --> 02:53.465
of broadcasting to you tonight

02:50.337 --> 02:53.465
from this remote location.

02:53.507 --> 02:54.675
- Ow!

02:53.507 --> 02:54.675
- What was that?

02:54.716 --> 02:55.926
Looked like

02:54.716 --> 02:55.926
a Ping-Pong ball.

02:55.968 --> 02:57.761
Now, as we all know,

02:55.968 --> 02:57.761
the annual

02:57.803 --> 03:00.514
Stars Hollow Winter

02:57.803 --> 03:00.514
Carnival is this weekend.

03:00.555 --> 03:01.974
Ow!

03:02.016 --> 03:04.434
Timmy, do not throw

03:02.016 --> 03:04.434
Ping-Pong balls at me.

03:04.476 --> 03:06.603
- 'You're a doo-doo head.'

03:04.476 --> 03:06.603
- Do not call me a doo-doo head.

03:06.645 --> 03:08.355
I'm in the middle

03:06.645 --> 03:08.355
of something important.

03:08.396 --> 03:09.731
Where the hell

03:08.396 --> 03:09.731
are you, Taylor?

03:09.773 --> 03:11.650
I'm at my sister's

03:09.773 --> 03:11.650
in Maine.

03:11.692 --> 03:16.155
Anyway, we have never not had

03:11.692 --> 03:16.155
a Stars Hollow Winter Carnival.

03:16.195 --> 03:18.197
It's a 125-year tradition.

03:18.239 --> 03:19.366
Is he getting

03:18.239 --> 03:19.366
to the point soon?

03:19.407 --> 03:20.450
Yeah, come on,

03:19.407 --> 03:20.450
doo-doo head.

03:20.492 --> 03:22.410
Fine, let's cut to the chase.

03:22.452 --> 03:25.622
I run the winter carnival,

03:22.452 --> 03:25.622
it's this weekend

03:25.664 --> 03:29.793
and I am snowed in,

03:25.664 --> 03:29.793
unable to get back into town.

03:31.336 --> 03:33.380
So, what's this

03:31.336 --> 03:33.380
about, Taylor?

03:33.421 --> 03:35.298
Maybe it's the lateness

03:33.421 --> 03:35.298
of the hour

03:35.340 --> 03:37.676
or-or the computer

03:35.340 --> 03:37.676
connection isn't clear.

03:37.718 --> 03:38.886
(Timmy)

03:37.718 --> 03:38.886
'Doo-doo head!'

03:38.927 --> 03:41.055
We have never had

03:38.927 --> 03:41.055
to cancel a carnival

03:41.096 --> 03:42.556
and it's absolutely

03:41.096 --> 03:42.556
impossible

03:42.597 --> 03:46.143
for me to get back

03:42.597 --> 03:46.143
into town to run it.

03:46.185 --> 03:47.895
I must be tired.

03:46.185 --> 03:47.895
I'm not getting this.

03:47.936 --> 03:49.312
It's like a riddle

03:47.936 --> 03:49.312
or something.

03:49.354 --> 03:51.481
People, are you not hearing me?

03:51.523 --> 03:54.151
I won't be there

03:51.523 --> 03:54.151
to run the carnival!

03:54.193 --> 03:55.777
Draw the obvious conclusion.

03:55.819 --> 03:57.696
Oh, okay, I got it now.

03:57.738 --> 03:58.947
(Taylor)

03:57.738 --> 03:58.947
'Thank you, Patty.'

03:58.989 --> 04:01.282
- Kirk, could you take it over?

03:58.989 --> 04:01.282
- Sure.

04:01.324 --> 04:03.202
Great.

04:01.324 --> 04:03.202
Anything else, Taylor?

04:03.243 --> 04:05.204
Oh, well, good for you,

04:03.243 --> 04:05.204
people.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.206
I guess we don't have to

04:05.245 --> 04:07.206
cancel it after all.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.957
Thanks, Taylor.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.957
Come on, let's get you to bed.

04:08.999 --> 04:12.335
I'm gonna fall back to sleep and

04:08.999 --> 04:12.335
dream about running Taylor over

04:12.377 --> 04:13.962
in that car

04:12.377 --> 04:13.962
I was looking at.

04:14.004 --> 04:16.215
Is there enough room

04:14.004 --> 04:16.215
to put his body in the trunk?

04:16.256 --> 04:18.008
Now, then,

04:16.256 --> 04:18.008
I would recommend

04:18.050 --> 04:20.177
that we immediately start

04:18.050 --> 04:20.177
discussing some details.

04:20.219 --> 04:21.803
The sooner, the better

04:20.219 --> 04:21.803
is always best.

04:21.845 --> 04:23.388
Now, then, food.

04:23.430 --> 04:26.725
We'll obviously have

04:23.430 --> 04:26.725
the carnival staples.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.643
French dip sandwiches,

04:26.767 --> 04:28.643
corn on the cob

04:28.685 --> 04:30.353
apple cider, et cetera.

04:30.395 --> 04:33.273
Now, we almost ran out

04:30.395 --> 04:33.273
of hot chocolate last year

04:33.314 --> 04:36.526
so I would recommend

04:33.314 --> 04:36.526
upping the supply by 11%.

04:36.568 --> 04:39.071
[inhales]

04:36.568 --> 04:39.071
Timmy!

04:39.113 --> 04:40.864
Put down that Rubik's cube.

04:40.906 --> 04:43.575
Timmy, do not throw

04:40.906 --> 04:43.575
that Rubik's cube at me.

No, you got a hybrid.

05:45.053 --> 05:47.931
That's very in right now.

05:47.973 --> 05:49.641
I've gotten so much done

05:47.973 --> 05:49.641
this morning, it's scary.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.392
- Coffee?

05:49.683 --> 05:51.392
- I already got some.

05:51.434 --> 05:54.604
I saw the sunrise. I paid all my

05:51.434 --> 05:54.604
bills. I already got some, hon.

05:54.646 --> 05:57.274
And this is a first, I saw the

05:54.646 --> 05:57.274

05:57.316 --> 05:58.817

05:57.316 --> 05:58.817

05:58.859 --> 06:00.277
in my<i> life.</i>

06:00.319 --> 06:02.070
You know, she and Matt Lauer

06:00.319 --> 06:02.070
are much more serious

06:02.112 --> 06:03.905
in the first half-hour

06:02.112 --> 06:03.905
than they are later on.

06:03.947 --> 06:05.615
I guess that makes sense.

06:05.657 --> 06:08.327
You know, you can afford to make

06:05.657 --> 06:08.327
people sad and angry about war

06:08.367 --> 06:10.120
and the economy and stuff

06:08.367 --> 06:10.120
when they first wake up.

06:10.162 --> 06:12.206
But then, just as they're

06:10.162 --> 06:12.206
heading to the office

06:12.247 --> 06:14.582

and whoosh,

06:15.917 --> 06:17.460
they're rarin' to go.

06:17.502 --> 06:20.672
Yeah, Matthew McConaughey

06:17.502 --> 06:20.672
always gets me rarin'.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.799
And I'm even

06:20.714 --> 06:22.799
volunteering to, uh

06:22.841 --> 06:24.301
man a booth

06:22.841 --> 06:24.301
at the carnival this year.

06:24.343 --> 06:25.844
I got a great concept,

06:24.343 --> 06:25.844
too.

06:25.886 --> 06:27.554
What about you? You got anything

06:25.886 --> 06:27.554
special planned today?

06:27.595 --> 06:29.514
Today? No, not today.

06:29.556 --> 06:32.934
It's a bunch of the same old,

06:29.556 --> 06:32.934
same old errands. The usual.

06:34.895 --> 06:36.355
Coming.

06:36.395 --> 06:39.107

06:36.395 --> 06:39.107
- See what you did here?

06:39.149 --> 06:40.817

06:39.149 --> 06:40.817

It's Logan's doing.

07:10.430 --> 07:12.015

07:12.057 --> 07:14.226
- Tell him to stop.

Then why

are we meeting here?

I thought kids

08:44.607 --> 08:46.443
liked parks.

It's 41 degrees out. Not exactly

I mean, we could have

08:51.239 --> 08:52.866
a snowball fight or something.

08:52.907 --> 08:55.452
My friend Remi got into

Did your mom explain

that this isn't

09:14.179 --> 09:16.056
necessarily

09:14.179 --> 09:16.056
a one-time thing?

09:16.097 --> 09:19.059
I was thinking maybe

09:16.097 --> 09:19.059
we could make it semi-regular

09:19.100 --> 09:21.144

make you proud, okay?

11:19.762 --> 11:21.348
Now..

11:21.389 --> 11:23.433
Excuse me, hi. Are you

11:21.389 --> 11:23.433
Liam Driessen by any chance?

11:23.475 --> 11:25.059
- I am.

11:23.475 --> 11:25.059
- Hi, Lorelai Gilmore.

11:25.101 --> 11:26.894
I'm here

11:25.101 --> 11:26.894
to make your stay

11:26.936 --> 11:29.022
and the rest of the New England

11:26.936 --> 11:29.022
maple syrup council's stay

11:29.063 --> 11:30.482
as comfortable as possible.

11:30.524 --> 11:33.276
So far, so good.

11:30.524 --> 11:33.276
Love the local color here.

11:34.653 --> 11:35.903
Kirk, it's really

11:34.653 --> 11:35.903
not appropriate

11:35.945 --> 11:37.405
to be standing

11:35.945 --> 11:37.405
right next to me like this.

11:37.447 --> 11:39.199
- But we work together.

11:37.447 --> 11:39.199
- But not here.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.992
- Can I ask you a question?

11:39.240 --> 11:40.992
- No, that's inappropriate--

11:41.034 --> 11:43.244
Would you pay a dollar to have

11:41.034 --> 11:43.244
your fortune told by a dog?

11:43.286 --> 11:44.621
A dog?

11:44.663 --> 11:46.122
It's for a carnival.

11:44.663 --> 11:46.122
It's very cute.

11:46.164 --> 11:47.666
A dog that has

11:46.164 --> 11:47.666
no previous experience

11:47.706 --> 11:48.791
telling people's fortunes?

11:48.833 --> 11:49.834
I don't know.

11:49.876 --> 11:52.420
Well, you're no help.

11:52.462 --> 11:55.923
Well, just part of our local

11:52.462 --> 11:55.923
color. He's purple.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.551
Get it? 'Cause local color

11:55.965 --> 11:57.551
and he's a color.

11:57.592 --> 11:59.553
- And how about a tour?

11:57.592 --> 11:59.553
- Sure.

12:11.565 --> 12:13.024
- That's what we got?

12:11.565 --> 12:13.024
- Yeah.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.985
It's posed, staged.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.985
Get another and make it candid.

12:16.027 --> 12:18.321
- Candid?

12:16.027 --> 12:18.321
- Don't question me.

12:18.363 --> 12:20.114
But it's a team photo.

12:20.156 --> 12:23.243
- Bill, how's it hangin'?

12:20.156 --> 12:23.243
- It's hanging okay.

12:23.284 --> 12:24.536
Good, good.

12:24.578 --> 12:26.745
- You like The Washington Post?

12:24.578 --> 12:26.745
- Yes.

12:26.787 --> 12:28.373
Because they like to split

12:26.787 --> 12:28.373
their infinitives

12:28.415 --> 12:31.000
The Washington Post,

12:28.415 --> 12:31.000
especially their metro writers.

12:31.042 --> 12:32.544
- But<i> I</i> don't.

12:31.042 --> 12:32.544
- I'm not saying--

12:32.586 --> 12:34.629
"The council member chose

12:32.586 --> 12:34.629
to forcefully waive

12:34.671 --> 12:36.089
her right of veto."

12:36.130 --> 12:38.341
Consider it unsplit.

12:45.973 --> 12:46.974
Hey.

12:47.016 --> 12:48.393
- You check in?

12:47.016 --> 12:48.393
- Check in?

12:48.435 --> 12:50.395
The board.

12:48.435 --> 12:50.395
The new system?

12:50.437 --> 12:52.188
This is the best way

12:50.437 --> 12:52.188
for me to know where anyone is

12:52.230 --> 12:53.690
at any given time.

12:53.732 --> 12:55.442
All the names

12:53.732 --> 12:55.442
are on the left.

12:55.483 --> 12:57.902
Each colored magnet

12:55.483 --> 12:57.902
represents an activity.

12:57.944 --> 12:59.820
If you're out on assignment,

12:57.944 --> 12:59.820
it's a red magnet.

12:59.862 --> 13:01.740
If you're in the John,

12:59.862 --> 13:01.740
it's a blue magnet.

13:01.780 --> 13:03.491
If you're at home,

13:01.780 --> 13:03.491
a purple magnet.

13:03.533 --> 13:06.160
If you're at your desk,

13:03.533 --> 13:06.160
it's a green magnet.

13:06.202 --> 13:07.704
But if they're at their desk,

13:06.202 --> 13:07.704
you can just glance over

13:07.746 --> 13:09.038
and see that

13:07.746 --> 13:09.038
they're at their desk.

13:09.080 --> 13:10.749
But I'd have to glance

13:09.080 --> 13:10.749
all around.

13:10.789 --> 13:12.709
This saves

13:10.789 --> 13:12.709
extraneous glancing.

13:12.751 --> 13:14.793
Look, it's not really

13:12.751 --> 13:14.793
for people like you.

13:14.835 --> 13:16.630
I know you're dedicated.

13:14.835 --> 13:16.630
I trust you.

13:16.671 --> 13:18.881
But I can't appear

13:16.671 --> 13:18.881
to be playing favorites.

13:18.923 --> 13:21.509
- I have a class.

13:18.923 --> 13:21.509
- Orange magnet.

13:21.551 --> 13:24.178
[Rory sighs]

13:28.767 --> 13:30.727
- Excuse me.

13:28.767 --> 13:30.727
- You're Rory Gilmore?

13:30.769 --> 13:32.479
- Yes.

13:30.769 --> 13:32.479
- Someone pointed you out to me.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.105
- This is for you.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.105
- What is?

13:34.147 --> 13:36.190
- The coffee cart.

13:34.147 --> 13:36.190
- For me?

13:36.232 --> 13:40.361
- Courtesy of Logan Huntzberger.

13:36.232 --> 13:40.361
- Oh, I see.

13:40.403 --> 13:41.988
Well, I don't want

13:40.403 --> 13:41.988
any coffee right now.

13:42.029 --> 13:44.031
Thanks anyway, and sorry

13:42.029 --> 13:44.031
you wasted your time, Ben.

13:44.073 --> 13:45.784
No problem.

13:45.824 --> 13:49.078
- What are you doing?

13:45.824 --> 13:49.078
- I'm hired for the day.

13:49.120 --> 13:50.955
- What?

13:49.120 --> 13:50.955
- Yep, all day.

13:50.997 --> 13:54.542
Any time you want some coffee,

13:50.997 --> 13:54.542
biscotti, I will be here.

13:54.584 --> 13:55.752
That's not necessary.

13:55.794 --> 13:58.797
I've already been paid,

13:55.794 --> 13:58.797
a lot!

14:00.006 --> 14:02.008
[sighs]

14:00.006 --> 14:02.008
Fine.

14:02.049 --> 14:04.969
[instrumental music]

14:08.807 --> 14:11.392
- Kiddo, is that the TV?

14:08.807 --> 14:11.392
- 'Yes.'

14:11.434 --> 14:12.935
You watching

14:11.434 --> 14:12.935
something stupid?

14:12.977 --> 14:14.395
- 'Yes.'

14:12.977 --> 14:14.395
- You promise?

14:14.437 --> 14:16.356
- 'Yes.'

14:14.437 --> 14:16.356
- Okay.

14:16.397 --> 14:19.066
[telephone ringing]

14:19.108 --> 14:21.486
- Hello?

14:19.108 --> 14:21.486
- 'Hi, Anna. It's Luke.'

14:21.528 --> 14:23.112
Hey there.

14:23.154 --> 14:25.615
So, she came back

14:23.154 --> 14:25.615
with all her fingers and toes.

14:25.657 --> 14:27.325
Very successful

14:25.657 --> 14:27.325
first outing.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.703
'Yeah, it was nice.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.703
It was, it was real nice.'

14:29.744 --> 14:31.454
She had a good time, too.

14:31.496 --> 14:33.373
And that's impressive

14:31.496 --> 14:33.373
'cause she's picky.

14:33.414 --> 14:35.458
'Good. Well, so did I.'

14:35.500 --> 14:37.794
So, she's coming by

14:35.500 --> 14:37.794
your work tomorrow?

14:37.836 --> 14:39.920
Oh, she told you that, huh?

14:39.962 --> 14:43.007
Uh, well-well, listen,

14:39.962 --> 14:43.007
here's the thing.

14:43.049 --> 14:45.092
I don't know if..

14:45.134 --> 14:47.762
...it's gonna work out

14:45.134 --> 14:47.762
for her to come to the diner.

14:47.804 --> 14:50.473
- 'Why not?'

14:47.804 --> 14:50.473
- It's gonna be really hectic.

14:50.515 --> 14:52.933
Lots of people

14:50.515 --> 14:52.933
swooshing around and all.

14:52.975 --> 14:54.310
[laughing]

14:52.975 --> 14:54.310
She'll like that.

14:54.352 --> 14:55.812
She likes people swooshing

14:54.352 --> 14:55.812
around her.

14:55.854 --> 14:57.397
Pans of hot grease.

14:57.438 --> 14:59.524
There will be pans of hot grease

14:57.438 --> 14:59.524
swooshing around her?

14:59.566 --> 15:00.983
If she's in the kitchen, yeah.

15:01.025 --> 15:02.276
Well, keep her out

15:01.025 --> 15:02.276
of the kitchen

15:02.318 --> 15:03.862
if there's any

15:02.318 --> 15:03.862
grease swooshing.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.697
I mean, that doesn't sound

15:03.903 --> 15:05.697
safe for you, either.

15:05.739 --> 15:07.532
I don't even know how much time

15:05.739 --> 15:07.532
<i>I</i> can give her.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.367
No problem.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.367
She's very low-maintenance.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.327
Just set her up at a table

15:09.409 --> 15:11.327
and she'll be fine.

15:11.369 --> 15:15.248
If there's a table, because some

15:11.369 --> 15:15.248
of the tables are reserved.

15:15.289 --> 15:17.625
I've got my regulars, you know?

15:15.289 --> 15:17.625
They want their tables.

15:17.667 --> 15:19.252
So there may not be room.

15:19.293 --> 15:21.003
She's little.

15:19.293 --> 15:21.003
You'll find room.

15:21.045 --> 15:25.299
You know, Anna, actually

15:21.045 --> 15:25.299
I don't know if tomorrow

15:25.341 --> 15:27.761
is gonna be good at all

15:25.341 --> 15:27.761
for anything.

15:27.802 --> 15:30.263
I didn't realize

15:27.802 --> 15:30.263
how busy<i> I</i> was.

15:30.304 --> 15:31.972
Factor in

15:30.304 --> 15:31.972
all the people swooshing

15:32.014 --> 15:33.266
and the grease swooshing.

15:33.307 --> 15:34.893
- Luke, no.

15:33.307 --> 15:34.893
- 'No what?'

15:34.934 --> 15:36.811
- It doesn't work that way.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.811
- 'What do you mean?'

15:36.853 --> 15:38.312
Look, I don't know

15:36.853 --> 15:38.312
what the problem is here.

15:38.354 --> 15:39.439
What're you talkin' about?

15:39.480 --> 15:40.981
You say you're available

15:39.480 --> 15:40.981
one minute

15:41.023 --> 15:42.567
and the next minute

15:41.023 --> 15:42.567
you're not?

15:42.609 --> 15:44.778
- I told you I was just--

15:42.609 --> 15:44.778
- It's not cool, Luke.

15:44.819 --> 15:46.279
It's not happening this way.

15:46.320 --> 15:48.322
What way?

15:46.320 --> 15:48.322
It's just a bad time.

15:48.364 --> 15:51.158
There's no great time to be a

15:48.364 --> 15:51.158
parent, Luke, you just<i> are</i> one.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.202
And if you're gonna

15:51.200 --> 15:53.202
make plans with my kid

15:53.244 --> 15:55.705
and get her hopes up

15:53.244 --> 15:55.705
and then cancel

15:55.747 --> 15:57.039
then our deal

15:55.747 --> 15:57.039
is canceled.

15:57.081 --> 15:58.499
- Anna, no.

15:57.081 --> 15:58.499
- 'Yes, that's it.'

15:58.541 --> 15:59.918
'That's how it works.'

15:59.959 --> 16:01.669
'You're either

15:59.959 --> 16:01.669
all-in or you're all-out.'

16:01.711 --> 16:03.671
We didn't ask for this.

16:01.711 --> 16:03.671
You did.

16:03.713 --> 16:06.257
You wanted contact,

16:03.713 --> 16:06.257
a relationship, and now--

16:06.299 --> 16:09.135
Okay, okay, I hear you. Have her

16:06.299 --> 16:09.135
come to the diner tomorrow.

16:09.176 --> 16:10.595
- You're sure?

16:09.176 --> 16:10.595
- 'I'm sure.'

16:10.637 --> 16:12.472
I was just over thinking

16:10.637 --> 16:12.472
all of this.

16:12.513 --> 16:15.475
- I'll see her tomorrow.

16:12.513 --> 16:15.475
- Okay, she will be there.

16:15.516 --> 16:17.477
Good. Thanks.

16:15.516 --> 16:17.477
It'll be good.

16:17.518 --> 16:20.313
It better be. Bye, Luke.

16:20.354 --> 16:21.731
Bye.

16:25.025 --> 16:27.654
She's starting to go through

16:25.025 --> 16:27.654
trash cans. It's creepy.

16:27.695 --> 16:29.864
That's a privacy violation,

16:27.695 --> 16:29.864
for God's sake.

16:29.906 --> 16:30.907
What's she looking for?

16:30.949 --> 16:32.659
Uh, buh, buh,

16:30.949 --> 16:32.659
buh, buh, buh.

16:32.700 --> 16:35.745
- Hi, guys.

16:32.700 --> 16:35.745
- Hey, Rory.

16:35.787 --> 16:36.913
'Did I interrupt something?'

16:36.955 --> 16:39.332
No, no, nothing much.

16:36.955 --> 16:39.332
Just hangin'.

16:39.373 --> 16:40.416
What's going on?

16:40.458 --> 16:43.127
Nothing.

16:40.458 --> 16:43.127
Just enjoying a tipple.

16:43.169 --> 16:45.296
So all the senior staffers

16:43.169 --> 16:45.296
from the Yale Daily News

16:45.338 --> 16:47.131
are simultaneously

16:45.338 --> 16:47.131
enjoying a tipple?

16:47.173 --> 16:48.466
- Tell her.

16:47.173 --> 16:48.466
- No.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.844
- Tell her!

16:48.508 --> 16:50.844
- Tell me what?

16:50.885 --> 16:53.554
- This is a war council.

16:50.885 --> 16:53.554
- About what?

16:53.596 --> 16:55.890
About Kaiser Geller

16:53.596 --> 16:55.890
and her reign of terror.

16:55.932 --> 16:58.184
- The paper is going to crap.

16:55.932 --> 16:58.184
- It's unreadable.

16:58.225 --> 17:00.812
She rewrites your stuff,

16:58.225 --> 17:00.812
then rewrites her rewrites.

17:00.854 --> 17:04.106
And to add insult to injury,

17:00.854 --> 17:04.106
the copy gets worse every time.

17:04.148 --> 17:06.985
She used to be good, right?

17:04.148 --> 17:06.985
Wasn't Paris good at one point?

17:07.026 --> 17:08.402
Before she was editor.

17:08.444 --> 17:10.613
Now she's Augusto Pinochet

17:08.444 --> 17:10.613
in a pantsuit.

17:10.655 --> 17:12.657
Yeah, what's up

17:10.655 --> 17:12.657
with those pantsuits?

17:12.699 --> 17:14.951
We're seriously considering

17:12.699 --> 17:14.951
Howell raines-ing her.

17:14.993 --> 17:17.286
- You want to force her out?

17:14.993 --> 17:17.286
- She's out of control.

17:17.328 --> 17:18.830
- And you have the authority?

17:17.328 --> 17:18.830
- We're the board.

17:18.872 --> 17:20.665
And the board has the authority.

17:20.707 --> 17:23.250
I'm a senior staffer, too.

17:20.707 --> 17:23.250
Why wasn't I asked to be here?

17:23.292 --> 17:26.170
- You're in Paris' pocket.

17:23.292 --> 17:26.170
- I am not in Paris' pocket.

17:26.212 --> 17:27.881
- You're friends.

17:26.212 --> 17:27.881
- Best friends, right?

17:27.922 --> 17:29.632
That's what Paris

17:27.922 --> 17:29.632
is always saying.

17:29.674 --> 17:31.843
And you guys live together.

17:29.674 --> 17:31.843
It didn't seem appropriate.

17:31.885 --> 17:33.928
Okay, let me set

17:31.885 --> 17:33.928
the record straight.

17:33.970 --> 17:36.096
I'm devoted to the paper, okay?

17:36.138 --> 17:38.016
Personal feelings cannot

17:36.138 --> 17:38.016
get in the way of things.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.184
Paris and I

17:38.057 --> 17:40.184
are not best friends.

17:40.226 --> 17:42.144
We're friends

17:40.226 --> 17:42.144
for the most part

17:42.186 --> 17:45.314
and I'm not immune to being

17:42.186 --> 17:45.314
driven crazy by her, believe me.

17:45.356 --> 17:47.692
- Oh, we believe you.

17:45.356 --> 17:47.692
- I'm getting crow's-feet.

17:47.734 --> 17:48.860
I'm sorry, but, Paris Geller

17:48.902 --> 17:50.528
is not going to give me

17:48.902 --> 17:50.528
crow's-feet.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.822
So you do acknowledge

17:50.570 --> 17:52.822
a problem here?

17:52.864 --> 17:55.033
I just did, A.K.

17:52.864 --> 17:55.033
Where's the trust, dude?

17:55.074 --> 17:56.784
We just want

17:55.074 --> 17:56.784
to do this right.

17:56.826 --> 17:58.369
Well, then, let's talk

17:56.826 --> 17:58.369
and maybe set

17:58.411 --> 18:00.287
the Howell raines-ing

17:58.411 --> 18:00.287
aside for now.

18:00.329 --> 18:02.415
Let's see if we can fix things

18:00.329 --> 18:02.415
before we blow them up.

18:02.456 --> 18:03.791
Fine. Sit.

18:03.833 --> 18:05.543
But allow us

18:03.833 --> 18:05.543
our cathartic purging.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.712
Purge away.

18:07.754 --> 18:10.631
Oh, but first would anyone like

18:07.754 --> 18:10.631
a refreshing coffee beverage?

18:10.673 --> 18:12.717
I have Ben till 9:00.

18:12.759 --> 18:13.927
I'll have

18:12.759 --> 18:13.927
a decaf latte.

18:13.968 --> 18:15.678
- Same here.

18:13.968 --> 18:15.678
- Can he do mocha latte?

18:15.720 --> 18:17.722
He does a great mocha latte.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.515
I'll have a mocha latte.

18:17.764 --> 18:19.515
Thanks.

18:23.185 --> 18:24.186
Uhh! Sorry.

18:24.228 --> 18:25.980

18:24.228 --> 18:25.980
Taylor?

18:26.022 --> 18:27.774
- Shh!

18:26.022 --> 18:27.774
- What are you doing back?

18:27.815 --> 18:29.358
I thought you were stranded

18:27.815 --> 18:29.358
at your sister's.

18:29.400 --> 18:32.152
- Lorelai, please.

18:29.400 --> 18:32.152
- Weird time for line dancing.

18:32.194 --> 18:34.154
Fine.

18:32.194 --> 18:34.154
Okay, I'm back.

18:34.196 --> 18:36.032
I got lucky last night and

18:34.196 --> 18:36.032
caught a plane out of Maine.

18:36.074 --> 18:37.324
Even with the rain

18:36.074 --> 18:37.324
in Spain?

18:37.366 --> 18:39.077
Will you be serious

18:37.366 --> 18:39.077
for a second?

18:39.118 --> 18:41.746
- What's with the sweats?

18:39.118 --> 18:41.746
- I'm incognito. Don't you see?

18:41.788 --> 18:43.163
With the carnival

18:41.788 --> 18:43.163
coming up

18:43.205 --> 18:44.999
this is my Huckleberry Finn

18:43.205 --> 18:44.999
opportunity

18:45.041 --> 18:47.251
to observe things invisibly.

18:47.293 --> 18:49.796
You know, I'm not gonna be

18:47.293 --> 18:49.796
around forever, Lorelai.

18:49.837 --> 18:52.673
- Oh, Taylor, are you sick?

18:49.837 --> 18:52.673
- No, just mortal.

18:52.715 --> 18:54.383
And eventually someone,

18:52.715 --> 18:54.383
maybe Kirk

18:54.425 --> 18:56.135
is going to have to take over

18:56.176 --> 18:58.679
the many delicate tasks

18:56.176 --> 18:58.679
I perform for this town.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.852
- Please keep my secret, hmm?

19:04.894 --> 19:07.063
- Mum's the word.

19:04.894 --> 19:07.063
- Well, I should go.

19:07.105 --> 19:08.522
- Back to eight mile?

19:07.105 --> 19:08.522
- What?

19:08.564 --> 19:11.358
Nothing.

19:08.564 --> 19:11.358
Ooh, behind you.

Got to keep body

19:19.909 --> 19:21.452

19:21.494 --> 19:23.329
Well, this is space 18

19:23.370 --> 19:25.331
and that's my booth,

19:23.370 --> 19:25.331
so we're a team.

19:25.372 --> 19:26.791
We should get uniforms.

19:26.833 --> 19:28.501
- You okay?

19:26.833 --> 19:28.501
- Yeah, I'm great.

19:28.542 --> 19:30.461
I lost my girlfriend,

my band's broken up

my best friend

19:30.503 --> 19:31.879
won't speak to me

as a $5-an-hour carny.

19:34.381 --> 19:35.925
Bob Dylan should write

19:34.381 --> 19:35.925

19:35.967 --> 19:38.052
- Yeah, well..

19:38.094 --> 19:39.804
But you'll get through

19:38.094 --> 19:39.804
this rough patch

19:39.846 --> 19:41.472
and life will move on.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.223
Trust me.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.223
It's human nature to move on.

19:43.265 --> 19:44.558
- What what?

19:44.600 --> 19:45.852
- You saying Lane's moved on?

19:44.600 --> 19:45.852
- No.

Have you seen her

19:45.893 --> 19:47.728

Oh, my God, God, God.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.575
Why are you putting

19:59.866 --> 20:01.575
the exact same booth

20:01.617 --> 20:02.618
right next to my booth?

20:02.660 --> 20:03.995
Well, frankly,

20:02.660 --> 20:03.995
I have my doubts

20:04.037 --> 20:05.830
about your dog's ability

20:04.037 --> 20:05.830
to predict the future.

20:05.872 --> 20:07.123
- You have your doubts?

20:05.872 --> 20:07.123
- Yes.

And in order

20:07.165 --> 20:09.458
to satisfy our guests

20:09.500 --> 20:11.669
I'm hedging our bets by putting

20:09.500 --> 20:11.669
the real thing next door

20:11.711 --> 20:13.629
so that no one walks

20:11.711 --> 20:13.629
away bamboozled.

20:13.671 --> 20:15.297
Kirk, there is no real thing.

20:13.671 --> 20:15.297
It's all fake.

20:15.339 --> 20:16.590
Those tarot cards

20:15.339 --> 20:16.590
are not real.

20:16.632 --> 20:18.092
My dog cannot predict

20:16.632 --> 20:18.092
the future.

20:18.134 --> 20:20.136
- So you admit it?

20:18.134 --> 20:20.136
- I was never hiding it.

20:20.178 --> 20:22.180
- That's fraud.

20:20.178 --> 20:22.180
- It's a doggy swami.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.973
My girlfriend says

20:22.221 --> 20:23.973
tarot cards are real.

Well, I like

20:24.015 --> 20:25.516

Uh, sure.

You don't know him.

22:14.250 --> 22:15.960
You don't have to lock your

22:14.250 --> 22:15.960
bike. This is a safe town.

22:16.002 --> 22:17.461
Well, I'm confused.

22:17.503 --> 22:20.464
[sighs]

22:17.503 --> 22:20.464
So, here it is.

22:20.506 --> 22:23.259
- I know. We met here.

22:20.506 --> 22:23.259
- Right, right.

22:23.301 --> 22:25.845
So, what do you want to do,

22:23.301 --> 22:25.845
sit and color?

22:25.886 --> 22:27.429
Color?

22:27.471 --> 22:29.265
[chuckles]

22:27.471 --> 22:29.265
Wow.

22:29.307 --> 22:32.726
I haven't colored

22:29.307 --> 22:32.726
in six or seven years.

22:32.768 --> 22:35.353
But that takes me back.

22:32.768 --> 22:35.353
Coloring. Wow.

22:35.395 --> 22:38.149
Okay, so you don't color.

22:35.395 --> 22:38.149
Did you bring a book?

22:38.191 --> 22:39.692
I don't really feel

22:38.191 --> 22:39.692
like reading.

22:39.733 --> 22:43.070
Well, I don't really

22:39.733 --> 22:43.070
have any toys or anything.

22:43.112 --> 22:44.780
Your salt and pepper shakers

22:43.112 --> 22:44.780
look a little low.

22:44.822 --> 22:46.824
Yes, they are.

22:44.822 --> 22:46.824
People salt stuff too much.

22:46.866 --> 22:48.201
Can I refill them?

22:48.242 --> 22:49.660
You want to refill

22:48.242 --> 22:49.660
the salt shakers?

22:49.702 --> 22:51.037
And the pepper.

22:49.702 --> 22:51.037
And possibly the sugar.

22:51.078 --> 22:52.538
We'll see how the salt

22:51.078 --> 22:52.538
and pepper goes.

22:52.579 --> 22:55.373
Oh, well, okay.

22:52.579 --> 22:55.373
Refill the salt and pepper?

22:55.415 --> 22:57.251
Whatever.

22:55.415 --> 22:57.251
I'll get the boxes.

22:57.293 --> 23:00.213
- Great.

23:00.254 --> 23:01.547
[both chuckles]

23:04.842 --> 23:06.260
Coloring.

23:09.387 --> 23:11.515
Well, it may surprise

23:09.387 --> 23:11.515
some of you

23:11.557 --> 23:15.686
but that's a syrup derived

23:11.557 --> 23:15.686
from a black maple.

23:15.728 --> 23:17.479
Yes, it's sweeter

23:15.728 --> 23:17.479
than the first two

23:17.521 --> 23:20.524
but it's a natural sweetness

23:17.521 --> 23:20.524
with a hint of orange.

23:20.566 --> 23:22.818
Very unusual and very good.

23:22.860 --> 23:25.154
Let's move on

23:22.860 --> 23:25.154
to number four, shall we?

23:25.196 --> 23:27.405
And number four

23:25.196 --> 23:27.405
is another little surprise.

23:27.447 --> 23:29.575
Ugh, gives my skin

23:27.447 --> 23:29.575
that weird, tingly feel

23:29.616 --> 23:31.244
like something's bubbling

23:29.616 --> 23:31.244
underneath it.

23:31.285 --> 23:32.786
It makes the root

23:31.285 --> 23:32.786
of my tongue

23:32.828 --> 23:35.039
feel like it's retracting

23:32.828 --> 23:35.039
back into my throat.

23:35.081 --> 23:36.749
What don't they pour it

23:35.081 --> 23:36.749
on something?

23:36.790 --> 23:38.458
A waffle, a pancake?

23:38.500 --> 23:40.586
So, let's go ahead

23:38.500 --> 23:40.586
and taste number four, shall we?

23:40.627 --> 23:42.880
- Then we'll talk.

23:40.627 --> 23:42.880
- Ew!

23:42.922 --> 23:44.965
Ew, drinking straight

23:42.922 --> 23:44.965
syrup!

23:45.007 --> 23:47.551
- We don't have to watch this.

23:45.007 --> 23:47.551
- It's hard not to.

23:47.593 --> 23:50.930
A bit of a tobacco taste to it

23:47.593 --> 23:50.930
and a bit of marshmallow.

23:50.971 --> 23:52.390
Oh, good, now

23:50.971 --> 23:52.390
I can't smoke a cigar

23:52.430 --> 23:54.432
or eat a marshmallow again.

23:54.474 --> 23:56.352
How does one discover

23:54.474 --> 23:56.352
a talent for this?

23:56.394 --> 23:58.854
Remember, for anyone

23:56.394 --> 23:58.854
who wants one

23:58.896 --> 24:00.564
we have spit buckets.

24:00.606 --> 24:02.358
- That's it.

24:00.606 --> 24:02.358
- See ya.

24:05.611 --> 24:08.155
[sighs]

24:05.611 --> 24:08.155
Hi.

24:08.197 --> 24:09.865
Hello.

24:09.907 --> 24:11.575
I was gonna call you,

24:09.907 --> 24:11.575
but then I figured

24:11.617 --> 24:13.911
you wouldn't take the call.

24:13.953 --> 24:16.414
Yeah, you figured right.

24:16.454 --> 24:18.207
I just need a minute.

24:18.249 --> 24:20.458
I can't fathom what a minute

24:18.249 --> 24:20.458
of my time is gonna do for you.

24:20.500 --> 24:23.212
Just a minute, please,

24:20.500 --> 24:23.212
then I am gone.

24:23.254 --> 24:25.714
Okay.

24:25.756 --> 24:27.758
Look, I know I'm not your

24:25.756 --> 24:27.758
favorite person in the world.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.302
No, you're definitely

24:27.800 --> 24:29.302
low on the list

24:29.343 --> 24:32.305
right above the guy who

24:29.343 --> 24:32.305
thought up smallpox blankets.

24:32.346 --> 24:34.765
Well, in my defense, I think

24:32.346 --> 24:34.765
I'm a notch higher than that.

24:34.807 --> 24:36.767
You're not exactly in a position

24:34.807 --> 24:36.767
to comment on that, are you?

24:36.809 --> 24:37.935
- No.

24:36.809 --> 24:37.935
- 'No.'

24:37.977 --> 24:39.437
In fact, let's take inventory

24:39.477 --> 24:40.478
of all the delightful things

24:40.520 --> 24:41.814
that have happened since

24:41.855 --> 24:43.190
you waltzed into

24:41.855 --> 24:43.190
my daughter's life.

24:43.232 --> 24:44.733
She was arrested, convicted.

24:44.775 --> 24:45.901
She's on probation.

24:45.943 --> 24:47.153
She'll have a criminal record

24:47.194 --> 24:48.404
unless we can get it expunged.

24:48.446 --> 24:49.571
She dropped out of school

24:49.613 --> 24:51.365
moved out of my house.

24:51.407 --> 24:54.285
She didn't speak to me for 5

24:51.407 --> 24:54.285
months, 3 weeks, and 16 days.

24:54.327 --> 24:55.869
No, wait a minute,

24:54.327 --> 24:55.869
come to think of it

24:55.911 --> 24:57.621
you're my favorite person.

24:57.663 --> 25:00.540
Okay, I can defend myself on one

24:57.663 --> 25:00.540
or two of those points as well.

25:00.582 --> 25:02.376
No, you can't.

25:00.582 --> 25:02.376
Why are you here?

25:02.418 --> 25:03.919
I miss her, okay?

25:03.961 --> 25:05.421
I made a mistake

25:03.961 --> 25:05.421
and I'm trying to rectify it.

25:05.463 --> 25:07.089
But nothing is working.

25:05.463 --> 25:07.089
She won't talk to me.

25:07.131 --> 25:08.841
Can you blame her?

25:08.882 --> 25:12.178
<i>No,</i> I'm doing everything

25:08.882 --> 25:12.178
I can. Flowers, gifts.

25:12.219 --> 25:14.721
- All your old standbys, huh?

25:12.219 --> 25:14.721
- Books, coffee cart.

25:14.763 --> 25:16.514
I'm trying to show her

25:14.763 --> 25:16.514
how I feel.

25:16.556 --> 25:18.809
And it sounds like she's trying

25:16.556 --> 25:18.809
to show you how<i> she</i> feels.

25:18.851 --> 25:21.519
Look, I figured this was

25:18.851 --> 25:21.519
a suicide mission, okay?

25:21.561 --> 25:23.189
It's probably something you

25:21.561 --> 25:23.189
and Rory will laugh about

25:23.230 --> 25:24.731
for years to come,

25:23.230 --> 25:24.731
but I'm not giving up

25:24.773 --> 25:26.025
until I exhaust all my options

25:26.066 --> 25:28.361
and asking for your help

25:26.066 --> 25:28.361
is one of them.

25:28.402 --> 25:30.029
- Really?

25:28.402 --> 25:30.029
- Yes.

25:30.070 --> 25:33.782
You're seriously here

25:30.070 --> 25:33.782
to ask for my help with Rory?

25:33.824 --> 25:36.160
- This is not a joke?

25:33.824 --> 25:36.160
- I'm going for broke here.

25:36.202 --> 25:38.704
Well..

25:38.745 --> 25:40.998
You got moxie, my friend,

25:38.745 --> 25:40.998
I'll give you that.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.375
I think I get it

25:41.040 --> 25:42.375
from my dad.

25:42.416 --> 25:44.251
- I hate your dad.

25:42.416 --> 25:44.251
- Me too.

25:44.293 --> 25:46.045
See? We have things in common,

25:44.293 --> 25:46.045
you and me.

25:46.086 --> 25:47.796
Maybe this isn't so crazy.

25:59.766 --> 26:02.186
- Oh, hi.

25:59.766 --> 26:02.186
- Hello there.

26:02.228 --> 26:03.437
Oh, what are,

26:02.228 --> 26:03.437
what are you doing?

26:03.479 --> 26:05.814
- Chores.

26:03.479 --> 26:05.814
- Yeah, I see.

26:05.856 --> 26:07.316
- Are you a strangler?

26:05.856 --> 26:07.316
- No. No.

26:07.358 --> 26:09.109
Just checking.

26:09.151 --> 26:10.944
Rice. That's the key.

26:09.151 --> 26:10.944
Prevents clumping.

26:10.986 --> 26:13.322
- Oh, yeah. I hate clumpy salt.

26:10.986 --> 26:13.322
- That's universal.

26:13.364 --> 26:15.533
So, uh, who do

26:13.364 --> 26:15.533
you belong to, Ceaser?

26:15.573 --> 26:17.243
- Who?

26:15.573 --> 26:17.243
- You're not Ceaser's?

26:17.284 --> 26:18.952
Not according

26:17.284 --> 26:18.952
to the lab results.

26:18.994 --> 26:21.288
- How'd you land the gig?

26:18.994 --> 26:21.288
- My father owns the place.

26:21.330 --> 26:23.040
The diner, at least.

26:21.330 --> 26:23.040
Not sure about the land.

26:23.082 --> 26:25.625
- Your father?

26:23.082 --> 26:25.625
- My biological father.

26:25.667 --> 26:27.378
Not really sure what to call

26:25.667 --> 26:27.378
him. It's kind of new.

26:27.420 --> 26:29.255
'Not the biological part.

26:27.420 --> 26:29.255
That was years ago.'

26:29.296 --> 26:31.090
'I wonder if brown rice

26:29.296 --> 26:31.090
would work, too.'

26:31.131 --> 26:33.133
'Brown might be more decorative

26:31.131 --> 26:33.133
or it might backfire.'

26:33.175 --> 26:35.135
'People might think

26:33.175 --> 26:35.135
there are bugs in the salt.'

26:35.177 --> 26:37.012
'I should put some brown rice

26:35.177 --> 26:37.012
in one of the shakers'

26:37.054 --> 26:39.932
and use it as a control group

26:37.054 --> 26:39.932
against the other ones.

26:39.973 --> 26:41.934
I thought

26:39.973 --> 26:41.934
you couldn't get away.

26:41.975 --> 26:43.102
I got away.

26:43.143 --> 26:44.520
She said she wasn't

26:43.143 --> 26:44.520
a strangler.

26:44.562 --> 26:47.523
- Uh, you want to go outside?

26:44.562 --> 26:47.523
- Uh-huh.

26:49.233 --> 26:51.444
April, I'll be right back,

26:49.233 --> 26:51.444
okay?

26:51.485 --> 26:53.028
Okay.

27:03.539 --> 27:05.082
- So she's--

27:03.539 --> 27:05.082
- Yeah.

27:05.124 --> 27:07.251
- Wow.

27:05.124 --> 27:07.251
- I know.

27:07.293 --> 27:09.462
- That's--

27:07.293 --> 27:09.462
- My daughter.

27:09.503 --> 27:10.588
I don't believe it.

27:10.628 --> 27:13.424
I still have trouble

27:10.628 --> 27:13.424
believing it.

27:13.466 --> 27:14.592
- You have a--

27:13.466 --> 27:14.592
- Yeah.

27:14.632 --> 27:16.343
Right. And what is she, 12?

27:16.385 --> 27:18.429
- Yeah, 12.

27:16.385 --> 27:18.429
- 'Twelve years!'

27:18.471 --> 27:21.348
Twelve years!

27:18.471 --> 27:21.348
This is for sure?

27:21.390 --> 27:22.849
It's for sure.

27:22.891 --> 27:24.059
When did you find out?

27:24.101 --> 27:25.811
- I just found out.

27:24.101 --> 27:25.811
- 'Just?'

27:25.852 --> 27:28.355
When just? She's in there

27:25.852 --> 27:28.355
filling salt shakers.

27:28.397 --> 27:30.357
It doesn't feel

27:28.397 --> 27:30.357
that new to me.

27:30.399 --> 27:31.733
[sighs]

27:30.399 --> 27:31.733
Two months ago.

27:31.775 --> 27:33.444
Two months!

27:33.486 --> 27:35.404
That's a hell of a long time

27:33.486 --> 27:35.404
to go without telling me.

27:35.446 --> 27:38.365
I know.

27:35.446 --> 27:38.365
I should've told you.

27:38.407 --> 27:39.699
She's cute.

27:39.741 --> 27:41.535
Lorelai, I'm sorry

27:39.741 --> 27:41.535
I didn't tell you.

27:41.577 --> 27:42.953
I'm-I'm sorry.

27:42.995 --> 27:45.331
It's all just a blur

27:42.995 --> 27:45.331
of stuff happening.

27:45.372 --> 27:48.334
I mean, she just came into the

27:45.372 --> 27:48.334
diner two months ago, no warning

27:48.375 --> 27:51.462
'talking about a science fair

27:48.375 --> 27:51.462
and how I may be her father'

27:51.504 --> 27:54.173
and she pulled my hair out

27:51.504 --> 27:54.173
and DNA-tested it.

27:54.214 --> 27:56.842
And then I wanted

27:54.214 --> 27:56.842
to forget the whole thing

27:56.883 --> 28:00.220
but I went to the fair

27:56.883 --> 28:00.220
and found out the truth.

28:00.262 --> 28:02.806
And we were at the park,

28:00.262 --> 28:02.806
and she wanted to come here.

28:02.848 --> 28:05.434
I called you today,

28:02.848 --> 28:05.434
and wanting-wanting a moment

28:05.476 --> 28:08.479
to talk about it,

28:05.476 --> 28:08.479
but you were busy, and..

28:08.521 --> 28:10.314
So I put it off again.

It's stupid. I'm stupid.

Look, I need to digest this

28:16.820 --> 28:21.325
and you have to get back inside

28:21.367 --> 28:24.495
so, uh, I'm just gonna go

28:21.367 --> 28:24.495
someplace where I can digest

28:24.537 --> 28:26.788
this and we'll

28:24.537 --> 28:26.788
just talk more later, okay?

28:26.830 --> 28:28.499
Sure.

28:28.541 --> 28:30.000

29:12.626 --> 29:15.337
Here's your number.

29:15.379 --> 29:18.173
Paris, you know me. I don't need

29:15.379 --> 29:18.173
a number and I'm the only Rory.

29:18.215 --> 29:19.799
But you don't want me

29:18.215 --> 29:19.799
to play favorites, do you?

29:19.841 --> 29:21.635

Paris, the atmosphere here,

29:33.021 --> 29:35.899
it's getting a little toxic.

I haven't heard

29:38.860 --> 29:40.446
any complaints.

29:40.487 --> 29:42.573
That's because people

29:40.487 --> 29:42.573
are afraid to approach you.

29:42.615 --> 29:44.491
You rewrite everything they do.

29:42.615 --> 29:44.491
You don't delegate.

29:44.533 --> 29:46.326
- That's not true.

29:44.533 --> 29:46.326
- Look.

29:46.368 --> 29:48.120
The staff and I

29:46.368 --> 29:48.120

29:48.161 --> 29:49.622
It was very impromptu.

I won't get into

29:49.663 --> 29:51.248
the hairy details

29:51.290 --> 29:52.791
but it would really help

29:52.832 --> 29:54.042
if you could relieve

29:52.832 --> 29:54.042
some of the pressure here.

29:54.084 --> 29:55.544
They think it's that bad?

Well, they were going too much.

People are getting

30:01.133 --> 30:02.884
very nervous here.

30:04.678 --> 30:07.514
Yeah, I see.

30:04.678 --> 30:07.514
I'll go talk to them.

You're damn right I'm tough.

34:16.763 --> 34:18.223
- She is?

34:18.264 --> 34:19.516
Yeah, she seems smart like you.

34:19.558 --> 34:20.726
What is it with

34:19.558 --> 34:20.726
the next generation?

34:20.767 --> 34:22.143
You're all smarter

34:20.767 --> 34:22.143
than the rest of us.

34:22.185 --> 34:24.103
- Not necessarily.

34:22.185 --> 34:24.103
- I'm freaking out.

34:24.145 --> 34:26.147
- I don't blame you.

34:24.145 --> 34:26.147
- What else is he hiding?

34:26.189 --> 34:28.358
I mean, how can you really

34:26.189 --> 34:28.358
know that you know somebody?

34:28.400 --> 34:29.442
I don't think you can.

34:29.484 --> 34:30.569
Every relationship is just

34:30.610 --> 34:31.611
a big, honkin' leap of faith.

34:31.653 --> 34:32.779
Yeah, I guess.

34:32.821 --> 34:34.406
You didn't ask

34:32.821 --> 34:34.406
about the mother?

34:34.447 --> 34:36.742
I just kinda ran off. I couldn't

34:34.447 --> 34:36.742
wrap my mind around it.

34:36.783 --> 34:39.411
Well, Luke must be freaked out

34:36.783 --> 34:39.411
double what you're freaked out.

34:39.452 --> 34:41.162
You know?

34:39.452 --> 34:41.162
Mr. Responsibility?

34:41.204 --> 34:43.081
He must've put his

34:41.204 --> 34:43.081
baseball cap on backwards.

34:43.122 --> 34:44.917
- Yeah.

34:43.122 --> 34:44.917
- I'm sure he panicked.

34:44.958 --> 34:46.209
I'm sure

34:44.958 --> 34:46.209
his not telling you

34:46.251 --> 34:48.211
says nothing

34:46.251 --> 34:48.211
about your relationship.

34:48.253 --> 34:50.630
Maybe this is a cheesy

34:48.253 --> 34:50.630
perspective to offer you

34:50.672 --> 34:52.090
but Gwen Stefani

34:50.672 --> 34:52.090
and Gavin Rossdale

34:52.131 --> 34:54.092
went through

34:52.131 --> 34:54.092
the same sort of situation.

34:54.133 --> 34:56.595
He found out he had a kid

34:54.133 --> 34:56.595
that he didn't know about

34:56.636 --> 34:58.638
but they made it work,

34:56.636 --> 34:58.638
as far as I know.

34:58.680 --> 35:00.599
- Meaning?

34:58.680 --> 35:00.599
- If they can, you can.

35:00.640 --> 35:03.435
- Really?

35:00.640 --> 35:03.435
- They're people. You're people.

35:03.476 --> 35:05.478
I mean, you don't sing

35:03.476 --> 35:05.478
and neither does Luke.

35:05.520 --> 35:07.022
But really,

35:05.520 --> 35:07.022
neither do Gwen or Gavin

35:07.064 --> 35:09.190
but they're still together,

35:07.064 --> 35:09.190
I think.

35:09.232 --> 35:10.275
I haven't read anything

35:09.232 --> 35:10.275
to the contrary.

35:10.316 --> 35:11.526
I guess.

35:11.568 --> 35:13.236
You and Luke

35:11.568 --> 35:13.236
just need to talk some more.

35:13.278 --> 35:15.906
Yeah. Maybe I'll tell Luke

35:13.278 --> 35:15.906
about Gwen and Gavin.

35:15.948 --> 35:17.074
I mean,

35:15.948 --> 35:17.074
if there's any people

35:17.115 --> 35:18.491
whose lives

35:17.115 --> 35:18.491
Luke would relate to

35:18.533 --> 35:20.326
it's Gwen and Gavin.

35:22.161 --> 35:23.162
[sighs]

[bell ringing]

35:37.385 --> 35:39.304
[indistinct chattering]

35:50.231 --> 35:51.691
They only cost 50 cents?

35:51.733 --> 35:53.068
Yeah, how lame would it be

35:53.110 --> 35:54.235
to go to the trouble

35:53.110 --> 35:54.235
of counterfeiting?

35:54.277 --> 35:57.823
No mind games. They're legit.

35:57.864 --> 36:00.742
- Another crime thwarted.

35:57.864 --> 36:00.742
- Good job, Columbo.

36:03.078 --> 36:04.245
Guten tag, there.

36:04.287 --> 36:06.247
I would like, uh,

36:04.287 --> 36:06.247
what you call them..

36:06.289 --> 36:07.958
...a hot dog?

36:08.000 --> 36:09.668
Coming up.

36:13.713 --> 36:18.593
<i>Ja.</i> Oh, und we are having cold

36:13.713 --> 36:18.593
weather this year, nein?

36:18.635 --> 36:20.219
[chuckles]

36:23.932 --> 36:26.518
- It's a smashing concept.

36:23.932 --> 36:26.518
- And Kirk was doubtful.

36:26.559 --> 36:29.021
- We've already raked in $18.

36:26.559 --> 36:29.021
- And the night is young.

36:29.062 --> 36:31.230
Come on, doggy swami,

36:29.062 --> 36:31.230
break's over.

36:31.272 --> 36:32.565
He is liking his hat.

36:32.607 --> 36:34.526
Well, it's very flattering.

36:34.567 --> 36:36.153
You know,

36:34.567 --> 36:36.153
I can man this myself

36:36.194 --> 36:37.278
if you don't feel

36:36.194 --> 36:37.278
like being here.

36:37.320 --> 36:38.488
No, it's good for me.

36:38.530 --> 36:39.948
Nothing is

36:38.530 --> 36:39.948
a better distraction

36:39.990 --> 36:42.117
than a dog in a turban,

36:39.990 --> 36:42.117
telling fortunes.

36:42.159 --> 36:43.702
It's a cliche for a reason.

36:43.743 --> 36:46.287
Come see

36:43.743 --> 36:46.287
the amazing doggy swami.

36:46.329 --> 36:47.831
Discover your future..

36:47.873 --> 36:48.999
If you dare.

36:49.041 --> 36:50.416
- It's silly.

36:49.041 --> 36:50.416
- And fun.

36:50.458 --> 36:53.670
And real. Very, very...real.

36:55.421 --> 36:57.549
Congratulations.

36:55.421 --> 36:57.549
Nice job.

36:57.590 --> 36:59.217
Want to play?

36:57.590 --> 36:59.217
It's only a dollar.

36:59.258 --> 37:01.011
Sure.

37:03.346 --> 37:05.348
Winner!

37:03.346 --> 37:05.348
We have a winner!

37:05.390 --> 37:06.933
- Really? That's it?

37:05.390 --> 37:06.933
- That's it.

37:06.975 --> 37:08.393
Here's your prize.

37:08.434 --> 37:10.562
"Hell is waiting

37:08.434 --> 37:10.562
for you, sinner."

37:10.603 --> 37:11.604
Enjoy.

37:13.732 --> 37:16.275
(Lane)

37:13.732 --> 37:16.275
'Alright! Who wants to win?

37:13.732 --> 37:16.275
Don't be afraid of playing!'

37:16.317 --> 37:19.071
Step up and play toss the

37:16.317 --> 37:19.071
sybarite into the hellfire's.

37:19.112 --> 37:21.031
Everybody's a winner!

37:21.073 --> 37:23.366
I'm gonna go take a little walk,

37:21.073 --> 37:23.366
check out the competition.

37:23.408 --> 37:25.577
Just, don't let my mother see

37:23.408 --> 37:25.577
you play anything too decadent.

37:25.618 --> 37:28.329
I'll be back in a bit.

37:28.371 --> 37:30.123
(Lane)

37:28.371 --> 37:30.123
'Come on people! Step right up!'

37:30.165 --> 37:32.792
'You can't lose.

37:30.165 --> 37:32.792
I'm guaranteeing you..'

37:38.464 --> 37:40.050
Ahh!

37:40.092 --> 37:43.469
<i>Oui. </i>

37:40.092 --> 37:43.469
Look at those games.

37:43.511 --> 37:47.557
It is so marvelous

37:43.511 --> 37:47.557
that I am here to see it.

37:47.599 --> 37:50.351
What a great country.

37:50.393 --> 37:51.937
<i>J'adore.</i>

37:51.978 --> 37:54.231
Taylor finally

37:51.978 --> 37:54.231
flipped his lid.

37:55.774 --> 37:57.984
Yeah, poor Murray

37:55.774 --> 37:57.984
couldn't make it.

37:58.026 --> 38:00.195
I made him drink 30 bottles

37:58.026 --> 38:00.195
of coke last night

38:00.237 --> 38:02.822
for the game here,

38:00.237 --> 38:02.822
so he's still throwing up.

38:02.864 --> 38:05.533
And then I ended up

38:02.864 --> 38:05.533
not using 'em. Shame, huh?

38:05.575 --> 38:07.326
But I'll tell him

38:05.575 --> 38:07.326
you said "Hi."

38:07.368 --> 38:09.537
Hey, want to throw

38:07.368 --> 38:09.537
some balls?

38:09.579 --> 38:10.956
Just don't laugh

38:09.579 --> 38:10.956
too hard at me.

38:10.997 --> 38:13.125
Never, never.

38:10.997 --> 38:13.125
Come on up here.

38:13.166 --> 38:15.919
- Give me some balls.

38:13.166 --> 38:15.919
- Fresh balls coming up.

38:20.673 --> 38:23.593
[laughing]

38:25.011 --> 38:26.012
- Yeah!

38:25.011 --> 38:26.012
- Watch it, honey.

38:26.054 --> 38:27.430
It could bounce off the back

38:27.472 --> 38:29.348
and hit the girls manning

38:27.472 --> 38:29.348
the dime toss.

38:29.390 --> 38:30.934
'There you go.

38:29.390 --> 38:30.934
You're getting the hang of it.'

38:30.976 --> 38:32.685
Yeah,

38:30.976 --> 38:32.685
cute little throw.

38:32.727 --> 38:34.187
- Excuse me?

38:32.727 --> 38:34.187
- Pretty boy says what?

38:34.229 --> 38:36.273
What?

38:36.314 --> 38:39.985
Jeez, Zach, what's with being

38:36.314 --> 38:39.985
all goose gossage?

38:40.026 --> 38:42.695
Zach, those aren't

38:40.026 --> 38:42.695
your bottles!

38:42.737 --> 38:46.449
Yeah! Yeah! Welcome

38:42.737 --> 38:46.449
to the SH, bitch!

38:46.491 --> 38:48.285
- What's your problem?

38:46.491 --> 38:48.285
- I don't got a problem, friend.

38:48.326 --> 38:50.245
My problem is I got no more

38:48.326 --> 38:50.245
bottles to knock down.

38:50.287 --> 38:51.830
Who do I give the prize to?

38:51.871 --> 38:53.539
Give it to Asian George Clooney

38:51.871 --> 38:53.539
over here.

38:53.581 --> 38:55.292
I'm outtie.

38:55.333 --> 38:58.837
So, I-I-I got smurfs

38:55.333 --> 38:58.837
and dirty pasta.

39:01.631 --> 39:03.382
- What'd you just put in there?

39:01.631 --> 39:03.382
- Nothing, lady.

39:03.424 --> 39:04.801
You stuck something

39:03.424 --> 39:04.801
in the cider.

39:04.843 --> 39:05.844
I did not.

39:05.885 --> 39:07.262
Although if I did

39:07.304 --> 39:09.306
it would be a thermometer

39:07.304 --> 39:09.306
and it might indicate

39:09.347 --> 39:11.933
that you are on the border

39:09.347 --> 39:11.933
of under heating your cider.

39:11.975 --> 39:13.226
- Get away from me.

39:11.975 --> 39:13.226
- Gladly!

39:13.268 --> 39:15.103
Now. Right now.

39:17.689 --> 39:18.815
- Winner!

39:17.689 --> 39:18.815
- But I missed.

39:18.857 --> 39:21.234
Everybody's a winner.

39:21.276 --> 39:22.652
Mrs. Kim.

39:22.694 --> 39:24.403
- I need a word with you.

39:22.694 --> 39:24.403
- I'm busy.

39:24.445 --> 39:26.572
You couldn't wait to put her on

39:24.445 --> 39:26.572
the market again, could you?

39:26.614 --> 39:28.700
- What are you talking about?

39:26.614 --> 39:28.700
- Who else? Lane!

39:28.741 --> 39:30.035
We only broke up

39:28.741 --> 39:30.035
a few weeks ago.

39:30.076 --> 39:31.577
What, you got her engaged

39:30.076 --> 39:31.577
already?

39:31.619 --> 39:33.288
- Engaged to who?

39:31.619 --> 39:33.288
- To who?

39:33.330 --> 39:35.790
The Korean Brad Pitt guy there

39:33.330 --> 39:35.790
with the Italian loafers

39:35.832 --> 39:37.959
and super white teeth,

39:35.832 --> 39:37.959
he's hanging all over her.

39:38.001 --> 39:39.627
- You mean her uncle?

39:38.001 --> 39:39.627
- What?

39:39.669 --> 39:40.879
Joe. He's her uncle.

39:40.920 --> 39:42.630
That can't be her uncle.

39:40.920 --> 39:42.630
Uncles are old.

39:42.672 --> 39:45.133
My mother had me,

39:42.672 --> 39:45.133
waited long time, then had him.

39:45.175 --> 39:46.425
Joe is my brother.

39:46.467 --> 39:50.222
- Whoa, okay. Oops.

39:46.467 --> 39:50.222
- Yes, "Oops."

39:50.263 --> 39:53.183
But just to be clear here,

39:50.263 --> 39:53.183
she's not hot on her uncle?

39:53.225 --> 39:54.642
She's not. Got it.

39:54.684 --> 39:57.020
Well, sorry.

39:57.062 --> 39:59.689
Wait! You accuse me

39:57.062 --> 39:59.689
of something?

39:59.731 --> 40:02.734
- We settle this now.

39:59.731 --> 40:02.734
- Alright.

40:02.775 --> 40:05.862
I am not going

40:02.775 --> 40:05.862
to get in your way.

40:05.904 --> 40:08.323
Okay.

40:12.911 --> 40:13.912
- Ready?

40:12.911 --> 40:13.912
- Ready.

40:13.953 --> 40:15.372
Spin the wheel.

40:17.332 --> 40:19.625
- The swami has chosen!

40:17.332 --> 40:19.625
- Ready?

40:19.667 --> 40:21.336
This is exciting.

40:21.378 --> 40:24.381
"You will sing songs

40:21.378 --> 40:24.381
of gemstones."

40:24.422 --> 40:25.548
Of gemstones!

40:25.590 --> 40:27.175
How do you sing songs

40:25.590 --> 40:27.175
of gemstones?

40:27.217 --> 40:28.968
I was a little tired

40:27.217 --> 40:28.968
when I wrote this one, sorry.

40:29.010 --> 40:31.054
You want to pick another one?

40:29.010 --> 40:31.054
Swami do-overs are allowed.

40:31.096 --> 40:33.848
No, I'll stick with this one.

40:31.096 --> 40:33.848
It's got an air of mystery.

40:33.890 --> 40:36.101
Hey, Luke, want swami doggy

40:33.890 --> 40:36.101
to read your fortune?

40:36.142 --> 40:37.394
Maybe some other time.

40:37.435 --> 40:38.728
- Hey.

40:38.770 --> 40:41.647
- Can we walk a little bit?

40:38.770 --> 40:41.647
- Yeah.

40:43.275 --> 40:44.734
I've got to apologize again.

40:44.776 --> 40:46.194
I should've told you

40:44.776 --> 40:46.194
immediately.

40:46.236 --> 40:47.862
I was just so confused.

40:47.904 --> 40:50.407
It's no excuse,

40:47.904 --> 40:50.407
but that's the excuse.

40:50.448 --> 40:51.783
I know. I get it.

40:51.824 --> 40:53.534
Nothing can prepare you

40:51.824 --> 40:53.534
for this one.

40:53.576 --> 40:55.703
Yeah. I just didn't know

40:53.576 --> 40:55.703
how to tell you.

40:55.745 --> 40:58.706
- I'm bad with things.

40:55.745 --> 40:58.706
- No, Luke.

40:58.748 --> 41:03.002
Listen, it's weird, you know,

40:58.748 --> 41:03.002
but we can make it work.

41:03.044 --> 41:06.756
I mean, she's there.

41:03.044 --> 41:06.756
April is there.

41:06.798 --> 41:09.342
Luckily you're with a woman

41:06.798 --> 41:09.342
who's raised a daughter

41:09.384 --> 41:11.636
and knows

41:09.384 --> 41:11.636
some of the ins and outs.

41:11.677 --> 41:13.138
- I can help.

41:11.677 --> 41:13.138
- I know you can.

41:13.179 --> 41:17.434
I guess it's just...it's just

41:13.179 --> 41:17.434
all so much right now.

41:17.475 --> 41:18.935
I've been dizzy for weeks.

41:18.977 --> 41:20.895
Yeah, I know.

41:18.977 --> 41:20.895
It felt like something was up.

41:20.937 --> 41:22.855
All too much, you know?

41:22.897 --> 41:24.857
Well, what all?

41:22.897 --> 41:24.857
Everything or--

41:24.899 --> 41:28.111
Well, I've got a kid. She's

41:24.899 --> 41:28.111
here, you know, June third.

41:28.153 --> 41:30.447
What about June third?

41:30.488 --> 41:32.031
It's just so soon.

41:32.073 --> 41:33.658
It's still months away.

41:33.699 --> 41:35.410
Well, it feels close.

41:35.452 --> 41:37.536
It's everything, you know?

41:35.452 --> 41:37.536
It's all piling up.

41:37.578 --> 41:40.373
It's all happening so fast.

41:40.415 --> 41:43.084
If it's all happening too fast,

41:40.415 --> 41:43.084
you know, we can just postpone.

41:43.126 --> 41:44.836
Postpone the wedding?

41:44.877 --> 41:47.839
Yeah, I mean,

41:44.877 --> 41:47.839
it's not set in stone.

41:47.880 --> 41:51.092
It just happened to work out

41:47.880 --> 41:51.092
for a date that soon.

41:51.134 --> 41:53.011
I don't want you going into this

41:51.134 --> 41:53.011
all jumbled up, you know?

41:53.052 --> 41:55.721
And that would be okay

41:53.052 --> 41:55.721
with you?

41:55.763 --> 41:57.640
Sure.

41:57.682 --> 42:01.727
Well, that'll help.

41:57.682 --> 42:01.727
Yeah, that-that'll really help.

42:01.769 --> 42:04.647
That'll give me time

42:01.769 --> 42:04.647
to resolve this other thing.

42:04.689 --> 42:07.359
Everything will be better

42:04.689 --> 42:07.359
later on.

42:07.400 --> 42:09.235
Well...great.

42:09.277 --> 42:10.862
Then it's a done deal.

42:14.407 --> 42:15.950
Think it might be

42:14.407 --> 42:15.950
a health-code violation

42:15.992 --> 42:17.910
kissing this close

42:15.992 --> 42:17.910
to the cotton candy booth.

42:17.952 --> 42:19.162
Meet me back

42:17.952 --> 42:19.162
at my place later?

42:19.204 --> 42:21.080
Yeah, see you there.

42:36.971 --> 42:39.224
