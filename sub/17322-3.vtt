00:10.520 --> 00:14.120
Tonight -we shout at the Government,

00:14.910 --> 00:17.920
a man drives a Subaru through a building...

00:18.650 --> 00:20.580
and a dog goes in a car.

00:28.080 --> 00:28.520
Hello!

00:29.350 --> 00:31.870
Hello! Thanks, guys. Thank you.

00:31.870 --> 00:33.140
Thanks very much.

00:33.140 --> 00:34.520
Thank you. Now...

00:35.180 --> 00:40.640
Now, as we know, as we know...

00:40.640 --> 00:45.570
nothing in life is very good and appalling at the same time...

00:45.640 --> 00:47.890
apart from the Jeremy Kyle Show...

00:49.970 --> 00:51.920
..and Manchester United.

00:55.030 --> 00:58.350
And all of Burt Reynolds' films.

00:58.350 --> 01:02.120
And actually,now there's a car as well.

01:05.170 --> 01:10.950
This is the latest creation from the skunk works inside AMG -

01:10.950 --> 01:14.870
the Mercedes SL65 Black.

01:14.870 --> 01:16.430
Good looking, isn't it?

01:16.430 --> 01:20.270
In a Jean-Claude.I'm-going-to-kick-you-in-the-face sort of way.

01:20.270 --> 01:24.250
Certainly, with those massively flared arches and all that ducting,

01:24.250 --> 01:26.490
it looks like it might be pretty fast.

01:27.220 --> 01:28.450
But it isn't.

01:29.430 --> 01:31.280
It's mind boggling.

01:35.870 --> 01:41.610
I have 660 horsepower at the disposal of my right foot.

01:42.780 --> 01:46.700
That's 50 more than you get from a Ferrari 599.

01:48.420 --> 01:49.770
Then there's the torque.

01:49.770 --> 01:53.550
740 foot pounds.

01:53.550 --> 01:58.060
That's 300 more than you get from a 599.

02:00.340 --> 02:02.810
Of course, to protect the environment and other road users,

02:02.810 --> 02:05.290
,the top speed is limited...

02:05.290 --> 02:09.770
to 199mph.

02:11.000 --> 02:17.074

02:19.440 --> 02:24.430
The engine that produces this almighty oomph is enormous -

02:24.430 --> 02:27.770
a 6-litre twin turbo V12.

02:27.770 --> 02:31.120
But the rest of the car is quite simple.

02:31.120 --> 02:33.920
The brakes are steel,not carbon ceramic.

02:33.920 --> 02:39.260
The gearbox only has five speeds,not the usual seven.

02:39.260 --> 02:45.200
The traction control has two settings - on or off.

02:45.200 --> 02:50.210
It even comes with run-of-the-mill suspension.

02:50.210 --> 02:54.380
The steering in this is a bit woolly... No, not woolly,

02:54.380 --> 02:54.380
more sort of nylon,

02:54.380 --> 02:58.690
but because Mercedes has thrown away the silly electronic suspension,

02:58.690 --> 03:03.710
gone back to a conventional set-up,it's very predictable.

03:09.860 --> 03:13.550
In many ways, then, this is like an American muscle car -

03:13.550 --> 03:18.720
fast, simple and, in some ways,quite cheap.

03:20.370 --> 03:27.330
It costs P250,000 and, yes,I know that sounds like a lot,

03:27.330 --> 03:31.330
but it's P100,000 less than the McLaren Mercedes.

03:31.330 --> 03:35.590
And is the McLaren P100,000 faster?

03:35.590 --> 03:37.910
Well, let's find out.

03:42.860 --> 03:45.240
God, that McLaren sounds dirty.

03:46.050 --> 03:48.260
If my children made a noise like that,

03:48.260 --> 03:50.470
I'd make them sit on the naughty step.

03:51.510 --> 03:56.900
I reckon, in a straight line,Mr McLaren IS faster.

03:57.570 --> 04:03.130
Not by P100,000,but in the corners...

04:07.790 --> 04:11.300
Smoke coming off the back end!

04:11.300 --> 04:16.910
Ten more horsepower, I reckon,ten more, and I'd have him.

04:20.040 --> 04:22.200
But the best thing about the Black

04:22.200 --> 04:26.100
is that, despite performance

04:26.100 --> 04:30.000
and the anabolic "look at me!" wheel arch extensions,

04:30.000 --> 04:32.470
it's a normal SL in here.I've got satellite navigation

04:32.470 --> 04:34.950
and climate control

04:34.950 --> 04:36.130
and iPod compatibility.

04:36.130 --> 04:39.690
I've even got an automatic gearbox.

04:40.340 --> 04:42.320
All good so far, then.

04:42.320 --> 04:45.130
But it doesn't last.

04:47.280 --> 04:51.840
First of all,it is THE most uncomfortable car in all of human history.

04:51.840 --> 04:55.810
There is no give at all in the tyre side wall.

04:55.810 --> 04:58.470
There is no give, either,in the suspension. Look.

04:58.470 --> 05:02.370
And look at these seats.One-piece carbon fibre

05:02.370 --> 05:04.700
from the Mercedes Agony range!

05:04.700 --> 05:09.630
You would honestly be more comfortable on a Georgian's kitchen wheelback.

05:09.630 --> 05:14.360
I can't imagine what Mercedes was using for inspiration.

05:14.360 --> 05:15.210
No, hang on a minute!

05:15.210 --> 05:18.410
I can imagine what Mercedes was using for inspiration.

05:18.410 --> 05:20.190
Look! A pile of stones.

05:20.190 --> 05:24.520
This is almost identical to the SL Black.

05:24.520 --> 05:26.250
I'll just try it out.

05:29.440 --> 05:30.290
Oh, hang on.

05:30.290 --> 05:32.980
Hmm. Yeah.

05:34.830 --> 05:40.830
Yeah, I would rather go to work on a cairn than in an SL Black.

05:40.830 --> 05:43.030
A cairn would be faster, too.

05:43.030 --> 05:47.490
The problem is,is that there's so much torque

05:47.490 --> 05:50.900
that if you pull out to overtake a lorry and put your foot down,

05:50.900 --> 05:54.610
the traction control comes down like an anvil

05:54.610 --> 05:55.890
and you're not going anywhere.

05:55.890 --> 05:59.940
Of course, you can turn the traction control off.

06:00.610 --> 06:01.780
But don't forget -

06:01.780 --> 06:07.850
those back tyres cost P358 each.

06:09.790 --> 06:12.610
Really, the only way you can drive this car,

06:12.610 --> 06:15.410
even when the road is dry,is slowly.

06:15.410 --> 06:18.960
And I don't know, but I think that rather spoils the point.

06:19.900 --> 06:24.070
Then there's the rear spoiler which comes up at 75mph.

06:24.070 --> 06:26.150
So if it's up, you're speeding...and some policemen will come.

06:26.150 --> 06:28.240
So if it's up, you're speeding...and some policemen will come.

06:28.960 --> 06:30.280
There are other niggles, too,

06:30.280 --> 06:33.820
like the fact it's out of fuel after 250 miles,

06:33.820 --> 06:37.910
and it has the turning circle of a moon.

06:39.410 --> 06:40.340
Look at this.

06:40.340 --> 06:44.820
A normal SL can get round here no problem at at...

06:45.810 --> 06:49.580
whereas the Black...can't.

06:53.100 --> 06:55.950
That means you're going to run off the road

06:55.950 --> 06:59.950
and damage that low-riding air-splitter.

06:59.950 --> 06:59.950
(LOUD SCRAPING)

07:02.220 --> 07:05.310
And I haven't even got to the worst bit yet.

07:07.830 --> 07:10.630
In a normal SL,which can turn round

07:10.630 --> 07:13.960
and run up kerbs without breaking your back, or itself,

07:13.960 --> 07:17.260
and go more than six feet without running out of petrol,

07:17.260 --> 07:21.450
you have a roof which folds away into the boot.

07:22.070 --> 07:27.450
In an SL Black, to save weight,the roof doesn't go anywhere.

07:28.140 --> 07:31.040
And then we have to go back to the price.

07:31.040 --> 07:35.250
Yes, the Black is good value compared to the McLaren.

07:35.890 --> 07:40.160
But it's five times more than its little sister,

07:40.160 --> 07:45.580
and I'm sorry...but it just isn't worth it.

07:52.280 --> 08:01.050
Superb, sublime, brilliant,super-exciting rubbish!

08:01.050 --> 08:02.030
But...  -It is!

08:02.030 --> 08:06.190
Am I right in saying that they've only imported eight of these into the UK?  - Yeah.

08:06.190 --> 08:09.540
So that means they need to find eight people in Great Britain

08:09.540 --> 08:12.900
with more money than sense?  - Yeah.

08:12.900 --> 08:16.540
So who does this one belong to? - Theo Walcott.

08:17.800 --> 08:19.470
Go on, then.Now where are you going?

08:19.470 --> 08:21.720
Anything I say now is going to belibellous, isn't it?

08:21.720 --> 08:23.980
Yeah.Yeah.I'll tell you what we'll do.

08:23.980 --> 08:26.610
We'll find out how fast this goes round our track.

08:26.610 --> 08:30.110
That means handing it over to our tame racing driver.

08:30.110 --> 08:35.750
Some say that he thinks crisps are animals...

08:36.600 --> 08:39.809
..and that if he'd done well at Wimbledon once in a while,

08:39.809 --> 08:43.940
he might have been able to raise a smile.

08:44.680 --> 08:48.620
All we know is,he's called the Stig.

08:49.780 --> 08:50.780
Away he goes!

08:50.780 --> 08:55.060
Traction control off because,of course, he can put those tyres on expenses.

08:55.060 --> 09:00.790
Into the first corner.Can't help thinking this is going to be a handful.

09:00.790 --> 09:02.340
Oh, yes, it is.

09:04.470 --> 09:08.390
Oh, dear. Yes, I'm sorry.The Stig has gone all Scottish.

09:08.390 --> 09:10.220
He loves to Strip The Willow

09:10.220 --> 09:13.620
with all those other Stigs that the Daily Mail's invented.

09:13.620 --> 09:17.190
Just a very big mess in Chicago.So Hammerhead...

09:17.190 --> 09:19.510
Lord alone knowswhat's going to happen here.

09:19.510 --> 09:23.140
Under-steer...over-steer...Under-steer then over-steer again.

09:23.140 --> 09:27.290
Every sort of steer,and all happening practically at the same time.

09:31.440 --> 09:36.780
Is that bagpipes or is it the sound of someone deflating a cat?

09:36.780 --> 09:39.600
Through the tyres -very, very fast.

09:40.980 --> 09:43.900
Now he comes in to the second-to-last corner,

09:43.900 --> 09:45.920
holding it nicely. Just Gambon left.

09:45.920 --> 09:47.940
Seems to be juddering through that.

09:47.940 --> 09:49.210
Across the line!

09:52.330 --> 09:54.470
I have the time in my hand.

09:56.400 --> 09:57.710
It did it...

09:58.380 --> 10:03.430
It did it in one minute 23 dead,

10:03.430 --> 10:07.800
so if we look, it's faster than the original Murcielago,

10:07.800 --> 10:11.980
it's faster than the original Zonda,faster than the original Koenigsegg,

10:11.980 --> 10:16.330
which means it's faster than a lot of cars that are now...

10:16.330 --> 10:19.350
faster than it.

10:19.350 --> 10:21.580
And now we must do the news,

10:21.580 --> 10:23.810
and starting off with Citroen,they've made a new C3.

10:23.810 --> 10:26.440
Here it is.And, well, it's a Citroen.

10:26.440 --> 10:29.680
It looks like that, but the mostimportant thing about it is,

10:29.680 --> 10:32.920
for this car, they've invented a new word.

10:32.920 --> 10:35.080
Word?!They've put itin their publicity material,

10:35.080 --> 10:37.250
and it's "visiodrive".

10:37.250 --> 10:39.430
They confessed they've made that up.

10:39.430 --> 10:41.610
It's a whole new word. Visiodrive.

10:41.610 --> 10:43.560
I'm sort of sympathetic.Why?

10:43.560 --> 10:48.300
Because none of the words you'dnormally use to describe a Citroen

10:48.300 --> 10:52.150
would work very well in their ownpublicity blurb, would they?

10:52.150 --> 10:56.010
Like,flimsy.Plasticky.Lightweight.

10:56.010 --> 10:58.110
Anybody else gotany thoughts on Citroens?

10:58.110 --> 11:00.900
Box on wheels. What?Box on wheels.

11:00.900 --> 11:03.700
That's not very good.That was terrible.

11:03.700 --> 11:07.420
Anyway, the point is that if you want a car that is Visiodrive,7

11:07.420 --> 11:09.150
that's your only choice,

11:09.150 --> 11:12.140
even if you are the Sultan of Brunei.

11:12.850 --> 11:15.140
Now, pay attention. OK?

11:15.140 --> 11:17.970
As men, we all know you should never,

11:17.970 --> 11:20.800
ever buy a woman something with a plug on it. Yeah?

11:20.800 --> 11:23.640
We know that. Yeah.I did.What?

11:23.640 --> 11:25.460
I did!

11:25.460 --> 11:27.690
You bought your girlfriend an electrical appliance?

11:27.690 --> 11:29.930
Yeah. I got her a power drill.

11:29.930 --> 11:33.170
James! James,she's a ballet correspondent.

11:35.020 --> 11:36.870
so I got her one.She SAID that!

11:36.870 --> 11:40.000
Do you know nothing?! Women say they want a power drill but they don't.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.140
they want soap. No...They always do, They do.

11:43.140 --> 11:44.610
But it's impossible to buy soap for a woman.

11:44.610 --> 11:46.080
Hang on.No, soap's soap.

11:46.080 --> 11:49.020
You can't...

11:49.020 --> 11:52.030
Did you hear that, girls?Soap is soap! But it is.

11:52.030 --> 11:53.750
Go on, then. Buy your wife some Swarfega.Well, that's...

11:53.750 --> 11:58.560
That's an effective cleaning agent.She'd be chuffed, I'm sure.

11:58.560 --> 12:03.430
However, the worst thing that you would ever have to buy,ever have to buy a girl,

12:03.430 --> 12:05.670
is a handbag. That's bad.

12:05.670 --> 12:07.290
because Even if,by some miracle, you got the right colour,

12:07.290 --> 12:08.920
it'd be the wrong shape,

12:08.920 --> 12:11.230
it wouldn't have the right number of pockets

12:11.230 --> 12:13.550
it would be last season's handbag.

12:13.550 --> 12:16.480
Is there a season for handbags?

12:16.480 --> 12:17.780
Did you hear him?

12:17.780 --> 12:19.630
Is...? Oh, yes!

12:19.630 --> 12:22.030
What, at certain times of the year,I can shoot handbags? Yes.OK.

12:22.030 --> 12:24.430
is that Ok?

12:24.430 --> 12:26.560
No. The fact is, OK,

12:26.560 --> 12:28.840
my wife has a handbag -I kid you not

12:28.840 --> 12:31.130
it is this big, OK?

12:31.130 --> 12:34.720
And in it, she'll go, "I've lost my mobile phone! Ring it!

12:34.720 --> 12:37.950
"""Ring it!"" ""It's in there.You must be able to see it."""

12:37.950 --> 12:40.430
"I can't see it!" The point is,"

12:40.430 --> 12:42.230
salvation is at hand, OK?

12:42.230 --> 12:44.080
New type of handbag out this week.Here it is.

12:45.250 --> 12:52.170
Look at that. Yeah. Now,that is made from Camaro seats.

12:52.170 --> 12:52.170
What?Yeah...

12:52.170 --> 12:54.220
And it says in the bumph...and I'm going to quote, OK?

12:54.220 --> 12:58.430
"""Try to picture your lady friend grasping it tightly"

12:58.430 --> 13:01.940
"""and the next vintage car show you both attend.""Ohhhh!"

13:01.940 --> 13:05.800
So this is made from seat clothof a Classic Camaro? Yes.

13:05.800 --> 13:09.420
So that's had a Texan'ssweaty buttocks on it? Yes.

13:09.420 --> 13:10.650
And now it's a handbag.

13:10.650 --> 13:15.340
On the other side - you can't see it -are the skid marks...NO! No!

13:15.340 --> 13:16.660
Hey!What?

13:16.660 --> 13:20.050
My bull mastiff keeps trying to mate with my Labradoodle.

13:20.050 --> 13:23.240
Bear with me, I do get back to cars.It keeps trying to mate with my Labradoodle, and I think

13:23.240 --> 13:31.520
I've worked out what the results of that coupling would look like.Here it is.

13:31.520 --> 13:33.530
Is that a motorcycle and sidecar?

13:33.530 --> 13:38.420
Sort of melted into one hideous lump. It's a Laverda 3CL.

13:38.420 --> 13:41.470
The man behind this is a French medical technician.

13:41.470 --> 13:47.560
Did he not, at any point whilst building it, just take one step back?

13:47.560 --> 13:48.850
"""Agh! It's horrible!"""

13:48.850 --> 13:53.830
If you know of anything uglier than that, you should write to us at

13:53.830 --> 13:59.670
"""I live next door to David Guest"",Top Gear...

13:59.670 --> 14:01.750
Can I say...? Sorry about this.Moving on.

14:01.750 --> 14:05.490
On Tuesday, or it might have been Monday, the Government announced

14:05.490 --> 14:09.160
what it call eda level 2 heat wave alert, OK?,

14:09.160 --> 14:14.080
for what we used to calla lovely summer's day.

14:14.080 --> 14:16.420
Actually, we quite like a good heat wave here on Top Gear,

14:16.420 --> 14:20.610
because it means we can play Car Sauna. It's really very simple.

14:20.610 --> 14:25.540
You park the car with the enginerunning, turn the air conditioning off, wind the windows up,

14:25.540 --> 14:31.360
turn the heater to maximum,and the first person to get outis the loser.

14:31.360 --> 14:33.320
You think he's making that up,don't you?

14:33.320 --> 14:36.350
Because earlier today, while we were waiting for all you lot to turn up,

14:36.350 --> 14:39.490
this is what we got up to.

14:39.490 --> 14:43.780
It's now 37.8 degrees in here,as you can see,

14:43.780 --> 14:45.780
before the test begins.

14:45.780 --> 14:47.970
Let's just make it fair, OK?

14:47.970 --> 14:52.140
Whichever one gets out first pays the other a tenner.

14:52.960 --> 14:56.600
Coming up to four minutes.Temperature check, please.

14:56.600 --> 15:02.120
Oh, yes.It's 53 degreesin our Mercedes now.

15:02.120 --> 15:03.650
Can you see my face?

15:03.650 --> 15:07.890
Can you see my face now?I'm not sure they'll want to.

15:07.890 --> 15:10.200
Given that we are made of...What percentage of us is water?

15:10.200 --> 15:11.510
98%.Or less.

15:11.510 --> 15:16.770
Water that then evaporates. So whatwe are breathing is each other...

15:16.770 --> 15:22.530
Agh! Agh! You're breathing my chest!Agh! Agh!

15:22.530 --> 15:27.100
59.7 degrees.

15:27.100 --> 15:28.480
This is a stupid game.

15:28.480 --> 15:30.930
I've changed my mind.

15:30.930 --> 15:33.660
61.9 degrees.

15:45.760 --> 15:46.800
Guys...

15:46.800 --> 15:48.440
Oh, come on.

15:48.440 --> 15:50.340
You owe us P10 each!

16:01.970 --> 16:03.370
A good idea.

16:03.370 --> 16:05.130
Gordon...

16:05.130 --> 16:07.540
Gordon, if you're watching,and you're probably not,

16:07.540 --> 16:11.480
if you're going to set these ridiculous heat wave level alerts...

16:11.480 --> 16:16.030
What was it we got up to?62. 62...62 degrees is your bottom...

16:16.030 --> 16:19.460
It gets a bit toasty. Uncomfortable.Yeah. About there.

16:19.460 --> 16:21.760
Gordon, they're something else I discovered in that test,

16:21.760 --> 16:24.070
if you're watching, and that is,

16:24.070 --> 16:27.240
I KNOW when I'm too hot.

16:30.100 --> 16:34.090
I don't need the Government to tell me to have a drink of water

16:34.090 --> 16:35.170
and put sun cream on.

16:35.170 --> 16:38.180
Leave us alone!

16:42.100 --> 16:43.390
Anyway...

16:44.500 --> 16:45.380
Guys...

16:49.480 --> 16:51.310
You'll have to split it.I've only got a 20.

16:51.310 --> 16:54.610
Don't worry.I'll put it on expenses(!)

16:54.610 --> 16:56.880
Now, the recession.

16:56.880 --> 16:59.080
We all know what caused it. Banks were lending money

16:59.080 --> 17:01.280
they didn't have to people who couldn't pay them back

17:01.280 --> 17:06.270
and now no-one can afford anything.Yes. And this begs a question.

17:06.270 --> 17:12.000
In these difficult times, is there such a thing as cheap and cheerful?

17:16.329 --> 17:17.329
No!

17:17.329 --> 17:20.880
I mean, when have you ever heard anyone say,

17:20.880 --> 17:25.210
"Right! I'm going to deploy my cheap and cheerful parachute?"

17:25.210 --> 17:27.730
"I could have had an expensive heart operation"

17:27.730 --> 17:32.990
"but I decided to go for one that was cheap and cheerful!"

17:32.990 --> 17:36.770
This Perodua Myvi suffers from the same problem.

17:36.770 --> 17:40.000
It costs P7,600, so it is cheap,

17:40.000 --> 17:43.290
but is it cheerful? No.

17:44.320 --> 17:46.320
Brakes are rubbish.

17:46.320 --> 17:48.330
Ride's rubbish.

17:48.330 --> 17:51.970
Seats are rubbish.

17:51.970 --> 17:54.850
That's rubbish.

17:54.850 --> 17:59.430
Honestly, I would rather be inside Paul Scholes.

18:00.000 --> 18:06.910
This is a car you drive with a long face.

18:06.910 --> 18:09.280
Still, could be worse.

18:09.280 --> 18:12.310
You could be in a Chevrolet Aveo.

18:12.930 --> 18:16.000
I like a basic, underpowered car,I think they can be fantastic fun,

18:16.000 --> 18:18.300
I like a basic, underpowered car,I think they can be fantastic fun,

18:18.300 --> 18:21.750
so it amazes me that they can make this thing so dull.

18:23.430 --> 18:28.540
The steering is meaningless,the pedals feel mushy,

18:28.540 --> 18:29.500
the seats are flat.

18:30.140 --> 18:31.640
The gear change is out of a...

18:31.640 --> 18:35.050
I think it's out of a Mark I Cavalier.

18:35.050 --> 18:38.150
No. That's not fair on the Cavalier.

18:38.150 --> 18:43.380
And the cost of all this misery?P8,500.

18:43.380 --> 18:45.950
The only reason you would buy this car

18:45.950 --> 18:48.400
is not because it's cheap, because it's not that cheap,

18:48.400 --> 18:51.790
it would be because you hadn't tried any others.

18:52.970 --> 18:58.240
I have! I've tried this,the Proton Satria Neo.

18:58.240 --> 19:01.080
It's actually not so bad when you're moving.

19:01.080 --> 19:02.500
That's not cos it's in any way fun to drive -

19:02.500 --> 19:04.850
it isn't.The gear change is awful,

19:04.850 --> 19:07.000
the engine's got no power low down whatsoever,

19:07.000 --> 19:09.060
but when you move it,

19:09.060 --> 19:13.630
at least you're obliged to look ahead, out of the cabin.

19:13.630 --> 19:15.000
Only when you stop do you think,

19:15.000 --> 19:17.000
"I'm sure I saw a nice surround on that air vent!

19:17.000 --> 19:19.180
I'll just adjust...

19:19.180 --> 19:23.820
"Oh, no! It's horrible.And look at all this!"

19:23.820 --> 19:27.730
"Ugh! That's not metal, either."

19:27.730 --> 19:32.680
At nearly P10,000, the Proton is the most expensive of the three,

19:32.680 --> 19:35.680
but you do get some unique features.

19:35.680 --> 19:40.770
The wing mirrors have been made using fairground hall-of-mirrors glass,

19:40.770 --> 19:43.400
so when I move my head like that,all the cars...blbl-bbb-blbl.

19:43.400 --> 19:45.000
So that's either a bus, now it's skip

19:45.000 --> 19:48.190
and now it's a big clown...

19:49.480 --> 19:50.650
Soon, we all met up

19:50.650 --> 19:56.700
and this was an ideal opportunity to show Jeremy one of the Proton's other unique features.

19:56.700 --> 20:00.130
Now, it's a sunny day.Put the visor down.

20:00.130 --> 20:01.760
Ha!You can't see a thing!

20:01.760 --> 20:03.000
You can't make the seat go down?

20:03.000 --> 20:06.210
You can a bit,but you have to open the door.

20:06.210 --> 20:07.000
So every time the sun comes out,

20:07.000 --> 20:10.290
you then have to open the door?Yeah.

20:10.290 --> 20:14.240
Look. They've managed to make Allen-headed bolts out of plastic.

20:14.240 --> 20:17.450
Cos I believe...

20:17.450 --> 20:20.190
That's a disappointment.That's wrong!

20:20.190 --> 20:22.330
Talking of fake, look at this.

20:22.330 --> 20:24.630
Ooh! That's not a real alloy.

20:24.630 --> 20:28.460
Are these fake, as well? Yes,they are.So fake wheel nuts?

20:28.460 --> 20:30.000
A year ago, we'd have been here with a Ferrari,

20:30.000 --> 20:33.110
a Lamborghini and an Aston Martin.

20:33.110 --> 20:35.500
Now...This is it.

20:36.440 --> 20:40.230
We'd chosen as our meeting point London's financial district,

20:40.230 --> 20:44.010
so we thought it'd be a good idea,while we were there,

20:44.010 --> 20:46.080
to introduce all the passing bankers and money men

20:46.080 --> 20:48.700
to the motoring world they'd created.

20:48.700 --> 20:51.870
What have you got now? XJR.An XJR?

20:51.870 --> 20:54.350
And you've got a...? BMW M3.M3?

20:54.350 --> 20:56.440
BMW X5.X5?

20:56.440 --> 20:58.580
So, welcome to the future.Your future.

20:58.580 --> 21:01.000
I'm not sure this is the right car for me..

21:01.000 --> 21:03.030
It's the ONLY car for you.

21:03.030 --> 21:04.290
You'd better get used to it.

21:04.290 --> 21:06.540
Lavishly equipped with doors.

21:07.170 --> 21:09.500
I'm not sure it's going to do the acceleration that the M3 does.

21:09.500 --> 21:12.720
It doesn't. I can assure you!

21:12.720 --> 21:15.000
You've been lending money to Mexicans

21:15.000 --> 21:17.480
who haven't got enough to pay you back, haven't you?

21:17.480 --> 21:20.920
You have! That's what you've done,and now look. Check it out.

21:20.920 --> 21:22.690
That one any better? No.

21:22.690 --> 21:24.000
Are all three terrible? Yes.

21:24.000 --> 21:26.710
Do you have this every day going round?Yeah, it does.

21:26.710 --> 21:28.000
Every day, constantly down? Yep

21:28.000 --> 21:31.170
Thought about jumping out of a window?

21:31.170 --> 21:33.520
It's a bit plasticky.A bit?!

21:33.520 --> 21:34.840
What are you doing at work today?

21:34.840 --> 21:42.620
We are looking into new markets in European gas.

21:42.620 --> 21:45.350
That might not be a bad thing for you lot - just flip it down,

21:45.350 --> 21:48.000
you wouldn't see the bridge coming up - everybody's happy.

21:48.000 --> 21:49.600
Have you noticed this?

21:49.600 --> 21:51.600
I put that back on earlier.Thanks(!)

21:52.430 --> 21:55.540
It just disintegrated while I was looking at it.

21:55.540 --> 21:56.940
What's the 0-60?

21:56.940 --> 21:58.990
Excuse me. Good news.What?

21:58.990 --> 22:02.600
You know we're here? A distraction?See the crowds?Yeah.

22:02.600 --> 22:04.000
That means that none of them

22:04.000 --> 22:07.080
can actually get into their offices and lose all our money!

22:07.080 --> 22:10.890
It's safe! We're providing a service to the nation.

22:12.420 --> 22:17.330
And then, after we'd moved on,I came up with another service for the nation.

22:18.240 --> 22:22.520
All the banks that go to the Government for OUR money,

22:22.520 --> 22:26.550
to keep going, make them have,as company cars,

22:26.550 --> 22:27.490
Perodua Myvis.

22:28.250 --> 22:30.000
RBS - you've been really bad.

22:30.000 --> 22:33.970
You can have a Proton "septic nappy".

22:33.970 --> 22:35.000
Yeah, Fred Goodwin,

22:35.000 --> 22:37.890
you keep your pension.

22:37.890 --> 22:38.560
Just one thing.

22:38.560 --> 22:41.600
Your car.

22:41.600 --> 22:45.620
Of course, bankers aren't entirely responsible for the problems...

22:47.170 --> 22:50.430
..which is why we pulled over,decorated our cars a bit

22:50.430 --> 22:54.280
and went to shout at the Government.

22:57.650 --> 23:00.490
-What do we want?  -Aston Martins!

23:00.490 --> 23:02.670
When do we want them?ALL: Now!

23:02.670 --> 23:06.030
V8 not G8!

23:06.030 --> 23:09.750
Give us a Rolls-Royce Phantom long wheel base now!

23:10.380 --> 23:15.640
2, 4, 6, 8, Jacqui Smith's husband likes to mast-...

23:15.640 --> 23:16.990
I can't do that one.

23:16.990 --> 23:22.400
Supercars not ministers...I'm not very good at this.

23:22.400 --> 23:24.560
Mind you, compared to James...

23:24.560 --> 23:29.800
Acceleration not nationalisation...of the banks.

23:29.800 --> 23:33.000
Although it's easy to make a case for state ownership of other industries,

23:33.000 --> 23:35.130
such as utilities.

23:35.130 --> 23:39.000
Ker-ching! Hit the banks not our tanks!

23:39.000 --> 23:42.230
He means your petrol tanks,if you were confused.

23:42.230 --> 23:43.230
Although, whilst we're at it,

23:43.230 --> 23:46.580
the Armed Forces are under-equipped for the job they have to do.

23:46.580 --> 23:49.190
A policemen then came to tell us off.

23:49.190 --> 23:51.530
Please don't hit me with your riot shield.

23:51.530 --> 23:55.350
But it was quite hard to understand him.

24:00.110 --> 24:01.530
What?

24:01.530 --> 24:05.470
I think that policeman's quite cross.

24:05.470 --> 24:10.450
In fact, he was so fed up that he told us to leave.

24:11.400 --> 24:13.650
That's not gone well, our protest.

24:13.650 --> 24:17.410
But we were fed up too...with our cars.

24:17.410 --> 24:22.280
So we left them in a stupid place and went home on foot.

24:22.280 --> 24:25.030
This tunnel handles better than my car

24:25.030 --> 24:27.370
and the interior is a lot more welcoming.

24:27.370 --> 24:29.140
It's a fact!

24:38.090 --> 24:41.060
Um...I should point out

24:41.060 --> 24:44.040
the producers were very angry with us about that,

24:44.040 --> 24:46.230
because they said we'd deliberately just gone

24:46.230 --> 24:48.420
and chosen three cars that we didn't like.

24:48.420 --> 24:51.410
Yeah, but we said we'd made a film to show

24:51.410 --> 24:54.410
just how many terrible cheap cars there are out there.

24:54.410 --> 24:56.070
And that buyers need to be careful.

24:56.070 --> 24:58.470
Exactly. Yeah. But they didn't buy that.

24:58.470 --> 25:00.710
They said we had to go out and make that film again

25:00.710 --> 25:04.410
and this time, choose three cheap cars that we actually like.

25:04.410 --> 25:06.470
Yeah. And we'll be looking at that later on.

25:06.470 --> 25:10.470
Now it is time to put a starin OUR Chevrolet.

25:10.470 --> 25:16.370
Er...over the years, 105 different people have driven round our track,

25:16.370 --> 25:21.340
and yet, unbelievably, only three ofthem have ever been called Michael.

25:22.800 --> 25:24.830
Well, don't worry -I can tell you're concerned -

25:24.830 --> 25:28.240
because that's all about to change.Ladies and gentlemen,

25:28.240 --> 25:31.660
put your hands together for Michael McIntyre!

25:36.100 --> 25:38.210
Jeremy Clarkson! How are you?

25:38.210 --> 25:42.330
Hello. Thank you, Top Gear.

25:50.590 --> 25:52.390
Why do announcers always say,"Put your hands together"?

25:52.390 --> 25:54.190
You'd just go like that, wouldn't you?

25:54.190 --> 25:59.710
I think it's like, "Put your hands together and pray that he's funny!"

25:59.710 --> 26:03.370
I gather that, on the way down here,people were offering you advice

26:03.370 --> 26:04.480
as to how you should drive..

26:04.480 --> 26:07.600
I got endless advice. From everybody.

26:07.600 --> 26:10.860
There was a woman at home... There'sa woman at home?!

26:10.860 --> 26:14.120
She's my wife!

26:15.230 --> 26:17.450
Yeah, my wife gave me advice.

26:17.450 --> 26:21.730
The drycleaner told me to turnthe air conditioning off in the car,because it makes it go faster.

26:21.730 --> 26:24.380
The drycleaner is talking sense.

26:24.380 --> 26:27.030
The guy who drove me here said,"Don't brake."

26:27.030 --> 26:33.390
I think he didn't like me very much.He just said, "Don't brake!"

26:33.390 --> 26:37.990
Let's have a look...Cos you have just boinged into the public consciousness.

26:37.990 --> 26:40.370
Two years ago - Michael who?.

26:40.370 --> 26:42.760
And now all these girls...

26:42.760 --> 26:45.350
They've been queuing here all day., Hi, girls.

26:45.350 --> 26:48.330
It's being going well lately.

26:48.330 --> 26:51.310
My show is on the telly on Saturday night after Casualty.

26:51.310 --> 26:52.840
# Do-do-do-do... #

26:52.840 --> 26:54.310
That's when my show starts.

26:55.530 --> 26:56.910
What, after it goes,do-do-do-do?

26:56.910 --> 27:00.110
I'm trying desperately to get on Casualty to publicise my show.

27:00.980 --> 27:03.480
I'd just like to be on a gurney and then sit up and go,

27:03.480 --> 27:06.410
"""Watch my show afterwards."""

27:06.410 --> 27:08.540
That'd be ideal.

27:08.540 --> 27:10.670
Anyway,your early life. School, obviously.

27:10.670 --> 27:14.650
University. Is it true you can'tremember what degree you did?

27:14.650 --> 27:16.270
That is true, yes.

27:16.270 --> 27:22.020
I did biology or chemistry.I've narrowed it down to two.

27:22.020 --> 27:23.510
But you don't know which you did?

27:23.510 --> 27:26.680
I know it wasn't physics.Is that good enough?

27:26.680 --> 27:28.920
How can you not rememberwhat you did at university?

27:28.920 --> 27:32.560
I remember being in the lab.I remember there was a lab...

27:32.560 --> 27:34.580
I remember finding a girl attractive on the first day

27:34.580 --> 27:36.610
and thinking,"That'll be the love of my life,"

27:36.610 --> 27:39.880
then they gave me a lab coat and huge specs.

27:39.880 --> 27:43.150
I realised the odds wereagainst me.Was it a girl thing?

27:43.150 --> 27:45.550
Um... University?Well, it didn't work.

27:45.550 --> 27:48.090
If you did biology,it didn't work.

27:48.090 --> 27:50.190
My voice didn't breaktill I was about 23.

27:50.190 --> 27:53.880
When you sound like your mother onthe phone... Hello?

27:53.900 --> 27:55.300
It's not Mummy, it's Michael.

27:56.290 --> 27:59.220
I'll get Mummy for you. Mummy?Phone!

27:59.220 --> 28:02.730
She'd come in...Hello?

28:02.730 --> 28:06.970
I actually had hair under one arm for a year. That was an odd...

28:08.550 --> 28:11.150
It was a difficult transition to manhood.

28:11.150 --> 28:14.180
But I did buy my first car to try and seduce women.

28:14.180 --> 28:15.100
Which was a...?

28:15.100 --> 28:19.130
I got a Triumph Spitfireconvertible.

28:19.130 --> 28:25.340
I had it for about six months and I hit a...a parked Volvo,

28:25.340 --> 28:28.290
which was not...Of all the cars to hit...

28:28.290 --> 28:30.800
It's not like I was picking them!

28:30.800 --> 28:33.610
And then the owner of the Volvo -it was outside his house -

28:33.610 --> 28:36.170
he ran out and said...He was very angry.

28:36.170 --> 28:38.830
He came up to the car and said,"Are you drunk?!"

28:38.830 --> 28:41.360
And I was so flustered and I'd beentold if you get into a crash,

28:41.360 --> 28:43.900
don't admit responsibility,

28:43.900 --> 28:47.470
so I just said, "Are you drunk?"

28:47.470 --> 28:52.580
To which he said,"I'm at home having dinner.What are you talking about?!"

28:52.580 --> 28:55.060
So, what are you drivingat the moment?

28:55.060 --> 28:58.350
At the moment, I have... My wife'scar and my car -

28:58.350 --> 29:01.640
we have two cars.That's allowed.

29:01.640 --> 29:03.570
They haven't banned it yet.They will, but they haven't yet.

29:03.570 --> 29:06.750
I feel a bit guilty about the car that I got her. because we thought...

29:06.750 --> 29:10.150
You won't feel guilty, becauseI know you like these big cars.

29:10.150 --> 29:11.950
I like all cars!Except for the three...

29:11.950 --> 29:13.130
I got her an X5, 4x4 car.

29:13.130 --> 29:16.550
I don't like that.Right. I do.A BMW X5.Yeah, I like it.

29:16.550 --> 29:19.280
It's got seats and you go,"Urr-urr-urr-urr-uh" like that.

29:19.280 --> 29:21.080
"""Urr-urr!"""

29:21.080 --> 29:24.560
So it's got adjustable...I love that, though.

29:24.560 --> 29:25.440
I've never had a car with that."Urr..."

29:25.440 --> 29:28.190
I try and drivein the most awkward positions.

29:28.190 --> 29:30.940
As far back... "Urr...urr!"

29:32.050 --> 29:35.140
Another thing with the modern issuewith the car

29:35.140 --> 29:37.310
is the parking sensors,which is brand-new to me.

29:37.310 --> 29:40.810
It senses when the carsbehind you... I love it.Exactly.

29:40.810 --> 29:42.500
It goes green and red."bup-bup-bpp-bpp-bb-bb-bb-BEEP!"

29:42.500 --> 29:45.600
It screams, like there's a littleperson going, "Aaaaargh!"

29:47.550 --> 29:52.950
It's like there's two little people,unseen, and they just go,"No, no, no, no, NO, NO! Stop it!"

29:53.630 --> 29:57.710
Why did you describe motorwaysas the "highway of life"?

29:57.710 --> 30:01.940
Well, after the Spitfire,I went into some really bad cars.

30:01.940 --> 30:06.850
I had my wife's car after that -we shared that. That was the Mini,

30:06.850 --> 30:09.450
Mini Mayfair.That's all right.Nice little car.

30:09.450 --> 30:14.150
Then I had my Austin Metro Princess,1.0.

30:14.150 --> 30:16.540
It had no fuel gauge, which was abit of an issue,

30:16.540 --> 30:18.940
because it meant Ihad to look up the miles per gallon,

30:18.940 --> 30:22.200
then count the mileson the milometerto work out how much fuel I had,

30:22.200 --> 30:26.700
which worked until the milometerbroke. Then I had to guess

30:26.700 --> 30:31.360
what a mile was... Then, ultimately,I ended up getting it wrong.

30:31.360 --> 30:37.710
I ran out of petrol, and I knewthere was a petrol stationquite near and I ran there

30:37.710 --> 30:42.310
and I didn't have a jerry can,and I presumed they'd sell themin the petrol station.

30:42.310 --> 30:46.080
I was queuing up and I completelyforgot the word for jerry can.

30:46.080 --> 30:47.550
My mind went blank.

30:47.550 --> 30:51.380
There was quite a long queueand I went, "Hi, I need a...um...

30:51.380 --> 30:53.540
"Ooh, I need a thing, you know."

30:53.540 --> 30:55.700
".Oh, God, it's a thingthat you put petrol in?"

30:55.700 --> 31:00.180
And the bloke just went, "Car?"

31:00.540 --> 31:05.940
The closest I got to was"petrol suitcase?"

31:06.520 --> 31:09.800
So this was why, I suppose, cos Ispent a lot of time

31:09.800 --> 31:12.480
with the Metroin the loser lane, the slow lane...

31:12.480 --> 31:17.800
Loser lane?..with the trucksand the lorries and the horses

31:17.800 --> 31:19.980
and the old people.

31:19.980 --> 31:21.230
The only way you could feel better about

31:21.230 --> 31:22.480
having such a terrible car

31:22.480 --> 31:25.430
is you would occasionally try andovertake nicer cars on the motorway.

31:25.430 --> 31:28.040
It's quite a manly moment.

31:28.040 --> 31:31.060
You're chugging along at 60,you're quite comfortable.

31:31.060 --> 31:33.080
You'll see a Porschein the middle lane,

31:33.080 --> 31:34.620
I'd say to my wife,"You see that Porsche?"

31:34.620 --> 31:38.160
She'd say,"Yes, what of it?" "I'm having it."

31:38.160 --> 31:41.900
She's like, "The Princess couldn'tovertake that Porsche, it's a 1.0!"

31:41.900 --> 31:43.690
"I can do this!"

31:43.690 --> 31:45.780
You pull into the middle lane,you start to get excited

31:45.780 --> 31:47.470
then you get into the fast lane.

31:47.470 --> 31:49.460
When you're in the fast lane in abad car,

31:49.460 --> 31:51.450
you know you don't belong.

31:51.450 --> 31:52.790
Big Range Rovers right up behindyou,

31:52.790 --> 31:55.130
flashing, "Retreat tothe loser lane,

31:55.130 --> 31:57.480
where you belong!"

31:57.480 --> 32:02.240
There are horses in the slow lane,going, "I've gotta see this.What's going on?"

32:02.240 --> 32:06.080
I think the top speed was about 76.

32:06.080 --> 32:11.120
You put your foot down and the wholecar would shake uncontrollably.

32:11.120 --> 32:14.310
It takes somewhere between 40and 45 minutes to pull alongsidethe Porsche.

32:14.310 --> 32:16.750
My wife's going, "I told you!"

32:18.030 --> 32:21.780
And you always have to look over,when you're overtaking,to see your victim.

32:21.780 --> 32:27.160
"Who are you, Porsche driver?"

32:34.950 --> 32:39.250
He's normally on the phone. He goes,"Hold on, I'll call you back.

32:39.250 --> 32:42.960
"Some dick from the loser lane'strying to overtake."

32:46.760 --> 32:51.940
I do that to people! "Get backwhere you belong!" I am that person.

32:51.940 --> 32:53.010
When I'm in the X5 now,

32:53.010 --> 32:54.850
if I get overtaken, even if I'm home,

32:54.850 --> 32:56.690
I will get back out and...

32:56.690 --> 32:59.930
"Get back to where you belong.

32:59.930 --> 33:01.780
"I've worked hard for this car."""

33:01.780 --> 33:04.860
I've driven hundreds of miles past where I live,

33:04.860 --> 33:07.950
just to overtake someone back again.

33:07.950 --> 33:11.940
Thing is, though, when we asked if you'd like to come on...

33:11.940 --> 33:15.620
Yes...you told the person who rangyou up that you'd be incredibly fast

33:15.620 --> 33:18.830
going round our lap.No,I don't know if I did. Did I?

33:18.830 --> 33:21.860
I said I'll try hard to be fast.

33:21.860 --> 33:26.260
You said you'd be very fast.It wasmore difficult than I imagined.

33:27.740 --> 33:31.160
Who here would like to see the lap?

33:31.160 --> 33:34.170
Yes!Come on, let's have a look.

33:34.170 --> 33:37.320
Here we go. I suspect...

33:37.320 --> 33:38.770
Go, go, go!

33:39.880 --> 33:41.710
Heading down to the first corner...

33:41.710 --> 33:45.240
Oh, my giddy aunt,that's...ambitious!

33:45.240 --> 33:47.070
Ambitiously fast, Michael.

33:51.720 --> 33:53.210
OK, now, into Chicago.

33:53.210 --> 33:56.340
Again, I'm suspectingyou're going too fast.

33:56.340 --> 33:58.160
Lost a lot of time with understeer.

33:58.160 --> 34:00.590
That's a screaminglyBLEEP.

34:00.590 --> 34:03.470
Straight into the Hammerhead.Trickiest corner.

34:03.470 --> 34:08.070
Did you enjoy this?I didn'treally... I lost track of time.

34:08.070 --> 34:11.469
There we go.Actually, that's not bad at all.

34:11.469 --> 34:14.060
No, you can relax after that.

34:15.620 --> 34:18.730
Ah!And you are doing!

34:19.610 --> 34:22.820
You are doing...And that's pretty fast.

34:22.820 --> 34:26.449
I'm impressed with this.And impressed with that!

34:26.449 --> 34:29.130
God, you really had picked upsome... Second to last corner,

34:29.130 --> 34:32.880
that's nicely done!Here we go, just Gambon...

34:32.880 --> 34:36.030
It's gonna be... Oh, my God!

34:36.030 --> 34:39.550
Well done!

34:40.900 --> 34:43.300
You nearly flipped it!

34:43.300 --> 34:47.820
You nearly turnedthe damn thing over!I nearly did.

34:47.820 --> 34:49.330
How close was that to rolling?I thought that was it.

34:49.330 --> 34:51.100
I said my goodbyes.

34:51.100 --> 34:53.820
That was pretty spectacular,wasn't it?

34:53.820 --> 34:57.150
It was a very ambitious second half to the lap

34:57.150 --> 34:57.870
and a very...

34:57.870 --> 35:00.330
rubbish first half.

35:00.330 --> 35:03.540
It was, it was. I know.Too fast into the corners.

35:03.540 --> 35:04.530
Mmm, where do you think?

35:04.530 --> 35:05.740
Where do you think you've come?

35:05.740 --> 35:08.930
Anywhere in the middle,I'd be happy with.

35:08.930 --> 35:12.120
As the Stig said,"conditions were perfect".

35:12.870 --> 35:17.300
Michael McIntyre, you did it...in one minute...

35:17.300 --> 35:22.000
..forty...I like that.I'm fine with that.

35:22.000 --> 35:25.010
..eight point seven.

35:25.760 --> 35:28.100
You're in here.

35:28.100 --> 35:29.540
Oh, look.

35:29.540 --> 35:32.540
Marky Mark and Michael McIntyre.

35:33.210 --> 35:34.860
That's not a bad time.

35:34.860 --> 35:36.500
I'm all right with that.

35:36.500 --> 35:37.940
That's right...Didn't I say in the middle?

35:37.940 --> 35:43.760
It's in the middle of the whole thing! You are the most average man in an averagely-priced car

35:43.760 --> 35:47.040
we've ever had.You are also one of the funniest.

35:47.040 --> 35:54.210
Ladies and gentlemen,Michael McIntyre!Thank you.

36:03.420 --> 36:08.540
Now... If you are any sort of a car fan,

36:08.540 --> 36:10.460
and you own an internet,

36:10.460 --> 36:12.770
you will most probably have come across a chap

36:12.770 --> 36:15.090
called Ken Block on your "Youbook" site.

36:15.090 --> 36:19.360
Young people tell me he is an internet sensation.

36:19.360 --> 36:23.070
That's why I went all the way to the United States in America

36:23.070 --> 36:25.250
to spend the day with him.

36:28.060 --> 36:31.250
I was told to meet him not at Dunkin' Donuts,

36:31.250 --> 36:35.940
but here, at Inyokern airfield in California.

36:36.900 --> 36:38.790
I can hear him coming now

36:38.790 --> 36:43.010
and I suspect he won't be arrivingin a straight line.

36:43.010 --> 36:48.780
No, he's more like a game station character who has emerged intothe real world.

36:56.640 --> 36:59.960
And that's why his films get more than ten million hits

36:59.960 --> 37:01.280
on "Facetube".

37:03.840 --> 37:06.760
Now, by day, Ken is a rally driver.

37:06.760 --> 37:10.770
But what's special about him is the way he sharpens his skills.

37:10.770 --> 37:15.380
You see, most rallyists prefer to practise in the forests of Walesor Finland.

37:15.380 --> 37:18.180
But Ken prefers to use...

37:18.180 --> 37:20.250
airports.

37:21.730 --> 37:26.300
Thing is, Mr Block, I look at this sleepy old airfield and this hangar

37:26.300 --> 37:29.300
and I think about preflight checks and the problems

37:29.300 --> 37:32.310
of weather cocking in crosswinds when you get a castering tailwheel.

37:32.310 --> 37:34.990
Looks like a playground to me. In what way?

37:34.990 --> 37:40.680
There's not so many places where youhave a great mix of dirt and Tarmac and open areas...

37:40.680 --> 37:44.280
And parked aeroplanes.  They're nice obstacles.

37:44.280 --> 37:50.140
Obstacles... I mean, the owners of them probably don't... Do they know?

37:50.140 --> 37:51.500
I'm not really sure.

37:52.710 --> 37:54.950
Ken has devised a course around this place,

37:54.950 --> 37:58.480
but he wants to keep the details a surprise. All I know is

37:58.480 --> 38:02.570
he'll be using his specially strengthened, 380 horsepower

38:02.570 --> 38:04.740
Subaru Impreza rally car

38:04.740 --> 38:08.640
and that today,there's a seat going spare.

38:08.640 --> 38:15.120
I, Captain Slow, will be here,with my bum on the best seatin the theatre of petrol,

38:15.120 --> 38:17.600
in the royal box of rallying,

38:17.600 --> 38:21.690
riding shotgun withKenny from the block.

38:23.610 --> 38:28.210
And I don't even have to do pacenotes, because he knows the route.

38:29.750 --> 38:31.000
You do, don't you? Mm...

38:37.240 --> 38:38.900
Where are we going?

38:46.200 --> 38:47.600
Bloody hell!

38:54.800 --> 38:56.880
Mind the aeroplanes!

39:06.440 --> 39:10.410
Are you sure?

39:10.410 --> 39:13.150
Door!

39:13.840 --> 39:16.480
Here we go again!

39:30.150 --> 39:33.850
God, that's unbelievable!

39:48.800 --> 39:50.570
Mind the pole!

40:03.160 --> 40:04.740
Wow, that was nice!

40:10.010 --> 40:12.380
Where the hell are we going now?!

40:19.320 --> 40:21.020
That's a fire station.

40:21.020 --> 40:25.020
Next stop,Ken's eyeball spin dryer.

40:39.760 --> 40:43.540
Tarmac session over,it was time for a dirt workout.

40:43.540 --> 40:45.860
Ooh, God!

40:56.440 --> 40:59.230
Oh, that's Mr Ricky Carmichael, a good friend of mine.

40:59.230 --> 41:02.020
I think he'scome out to play with us.

41:02.020 --> 41:06.040
As it happens, Ricky is the greatest dirt-biker in history,

41:06.040 --> 41:09.300
15 times undefeated champion.

41:09.300 --> 41:11.460
Go get him, Mr Block.

41:13.690 --> 41:14.840
Ow!

41:17.670 --> 41:19.740
Oh, there...BLEEP!

41:31.410 --> 41:34.070
On the straights,Kenny was much faster,

41:34.070 --> 41:38.710
but Ricky was a genius at finding shortcuts.

41:39.980 --> 41:40.910
Where's he gone?

41:53.010 --> 41:56.780
Kenny and Ricky wanted to play withsome more planes.'

41:59.910 --> 42:03.510
No, no! Goodbye, viewers!

42:12.290 --> 42:15.100
That's the nose of a DC-2.

42:23.300 --> 42:24.440
He's getting away.

42:25.300 --> 42:27.060
Not over there, that's a jump.

42:27.060 --> 42:29.740
That's a motocross jump. No!

42:54.160 --> 42:55.430
We're alive!

42:57.770 --> 43:00.650
That was incredible!

43:01.270 --> 43:02.500
God!

43:05.310 --> 43:06.450
Now look what you've done!

43:18.440 --> 43:23.820
Am I right in saying he's coming to Britain later this year,

43:23.820 --> 43:24.480
to play on our track?

43:24.480 --> 43:25.210
Yes.

43:25.210 --> 43:28.760
We could use his aeroplaneas one of the obstacles.Yes! No.

43:28.760 --> 43:32.500
The man's useless.He can't drive in a straight line.

43:32.500 --> 43:35.460
Captain Slow rather missing the point there. Anyway,

43:35.460 --> 43:40.220
earlier on, we sort of suggested that all cheap cars are rubbish

43:40.220 --> 43:42.240
and the producers said that was nonsense and told us to go away,

43:42.240 --> 43:44.260
put our heads in some books

43:44.260 --> 43:48.250
and not take them out again tillwe'd come up with a cheap carthat we all liked.

43:48.250 --> 43:52.180
After a solid 24 minutes of reading,inevitably,

43:52.180 --> 43:55.110
we'd come up with three cheap cars that we liked.

43:55.110 --> 44:00.020
So, it was time to go down to ourtrack to find out which was best.

44:03.620 --> 44:05.110
This is my choice.

44:05.110 --> 44:08.920
It's a Skoda with a microscopic diesel engine

44:08.920 --> 44:10.950
and a top speed of 92.

44:10.950 --> 44:14.710
That doesn't sound so good,but it's called the Roomster.

44:14.710 --> 44:16.910
And that sounds great!

44:16.910 --> 44:18.280
Roomster
Roomster.

44:18.280 --> 44:22.670
I like to think that's what MarcBolan would've called his lounge.

44:22.670 --> 44:25.600
This is what I've chosen - the Mito.

44:25.600 --> 44:32.370
At P11,500, it costs exactly the sameas Jeremy's diesel-powered van.

44:33.450 --> 44:36.510
But this is an Alfa Romeo.

44:36.510 --> 44:40.650
P11,500 for a brand-new Alfa Romeo.

44:40.650 --> 44:46.270
You'd have to have a heart of stone and a soul of custard to turn that down.

44:47.960 --> 44:51.360
Then James arrived...in a dishwasher.

44:52.060 --> 44:54.910
This may have the enginefrom a dishwasher -

44:54.910 --> 44:58.580
just three cylinders and 1,000cc -

44:58.580 --> 45:02.250
but it is the most futuristic and modern car here.

45:02.250 --> 45:05.830
It's called the Toyota IQ and it's the biggest leap

45:05.830 --> 45:09.420
in small cardesign since Dinky went bust.

45:11.250 --> 45:13.670
In order to sort out which is the best car,

45:13.670 --> 45:17.160
we've each been allowed to choose one test.

45:17.160 --> 45:19.770
I'm going first and I've decidedthe first test will be...

45:19.770 --> 45:23.680
a drag race...obviously.

45:27.610 --> 45:30.140
I'm not feeling confident about this,

45:30.140 --> 45:35.070
because, although I have the samepower as James has in his Zanussi,

45:35.070 --> 45:37.920
the Roomster's a lot biggerand heavier.

45:37.920 --> 45:41.320
0-60 in 16.4 seconds.

45:41.320 --> 45:45.090
And that, in English, is exactly...

45:46.070 --> 45:49.720
..one year.

45:51.560 --> 45:52.980
Got James!

45:53.770 --> 45:55.660
Lost James.

45:57.310 --> 45:59.340
He-he-he! Not bad.

46:01.930 --> 46:05.030
And we're through. Ha-ha-ha!

46:05.030 --> 46:12.730
Shortly afterwards,the Indesit finished as well.And then the waiting began.'

46:44.340 --> 46:47.240
And in 1976, we went to Tenby,hired a cottage.

46:47.240 --> 46:50.410
We went there. A cottage? Yeah.You must have been posh. We had a tent.

46:50.410 --> 46:54.220
Ooh, look! Is that him, or is thatjust another car that's going past?

46:54.220 --> 46:55.440
I don't know.

46:55.970 --> 46:58.060
I've actually forgot ten what his car looks like.

46:58.060 --> 47:01.130
Power, power, power, speed -irrelevant.

47:01.130 --> 47:04.780
What's the excuse going to be?Ooh, tyre pressure.

47:04.780 --> 47:06.480
You lost,in case you were wondering.

47:06.480 --> 47:11.950
This car -faster than a Porsche 911 Turbo.

47:11.950 --> 47:13.690
Yes, of course(!)How did you make that out?

47:13.690 --> 47:18.410
Well, if a Porsche is doing 30, I'm doing 35, I could easily get by.

47:18.410 --> 47:21.240
What about if it was doing 93?That would be against the law.

47:21.240 --> 47:23.370
He'd hopefully havehis licence taken away.

47:23.370 --> 47:25.910
There's another thing about this.What?

47:25.910 --> 47:29.150
That is pure Lancia Stratos.

47:29.150 --> 47:31.930
No, it isn't. I'll grant you...What do you mean?!It just isn't.

47:31.930 --> 47:35.550
Says the man in the Indesit!What...come on!Chaps,

47:35.550 --> 47:38.050
I'll just bring you back tomy point,

47:38.050 --> 47:40.560
which is that only one of these three cars is an Alfa Romeo.

47:40.560 --> 47:44.430
The Alfa Romeo, which, if you peel away the body, is a Fiat Punto.

47:44.430 --> 47:47.050
It's an Alfa Romeo!It's a Fiat Punto with Alfa written on it!

47:47.050 --> 47:49.680
This is a Stratos!

47:49.680 --> 47:53.260
It was then my turn to dream up a test and, since I had a Toyota,

47:53.260 --> 47:55.550
I thought we should measure quality.'

47:56.410 --> 47:59.080
Right, each car is equippedwith one of these.

47:59.080 --> 48:02.040
It's a decibel-o-meter. This will measure how loud your car is

48:02.040 --> 48:04.850
through Lionel Richie's head in the 1980s.

48:04.850 --> 48:06.260
You'll also be sitting onone of these -

48:06.260 --> 48:08.910
this is a vibration and harshness-o-meter

48:08.910 --> 48:12.430
and this measures vibration and harshness.Right! Let's do it.

48:12.430 --> 48:15.280
It's got three axes of measurement...

48:15.280 --> 48:18.110
Does it produce a numberat the end of the test? Yes.

48:18.110 --> 48:19.810
Right, good.Good. Let's do it.

48:21.350 --> 48:28.410
With the equipment installed,we set off at a scientific 50mph.

48:36.420 --> 48:39.670
This may only have a three-cylinder diesel engine,

48:39.670 --> 48:42.920
but it's so quiet inhere, I can hear my hair growing.

48:42.920 --> 48:49.300
Jeremy, it's a noise test and the machine is picking up your voice.

48:50.690 --> 48:55.060
After another run,we pulled over to see who'd won.

48:55.060 --> 48:56.550
How big is my victory?

48:56.550 --> 48:57.960
Not great.

48:57.960 --> 49:00.790
You two are neck-and-neckat 63 decibels of noise.

49:00.790 --> 49:04.760
I have 61. So it's better.It's quieter?!Yes.

49:04.760 --> 49:08.330
Low numbers are better. Vibration and harshness, Jeremy - 2.1.Yes!

49:09.300 --> 49:12.270
Let's see. Hammond, 1.8.Ha-ha!

49:12.270 --> 49:13.920
And I'm 1.5.

49:13.920 --> 49:17.190
It doesn't matter,because it is now time for my test.

49:17.190 --> 49:21.660
What we're going to do now is a lap of the track.

49:21.660 --> 49:22.830
The Skoda van's going to cream that(!)

49:22.830 --> 49:25.930
While carrying something.What?

49:25.930 --> 49:30.890
A dog.Let me guess -is it a King Charles spaniel?

49:30.890 --> 49:34.900
In fact, I'd lined up, Lance,an Irish Wolfhound,

49:34.900 --> 49:39.700
Milly, a Great Dane and Alfie,a St Bernard.

49:40.510 --> 49:46.910
OK, here's how it works, right?Start the clock,then you load the dog into the car,

49:46.910 --> 49:50.490
you may have to lower your rear seats, yes?

49:50.920 --> 49:52.350
Do a lap, cross the line,stop the clock.

49:52.350 --> 49:55.080
I'll get my dog then.

49:55.320 --> 49:57.430
There is one rule in my test, yes?

49:57.430 --> 49:59.530
Don't drive like an idiot on the lap.

49:59.530 --> 50:01.640
If, when you get back,this dog looks sad,

50:01.640 --> 50:03.540
you're disqualified.

50:03.540 --> 50:04.510
OK, Lance, come on.

50:05.290 --> 50:07.680
But St Bernards always look sad.

50:07.680 --> 50:10.170
Ready? Go!

50:10.170 --> 50:11.870
He's in.Oh.

50:12.480 --> 50:14.870
I don't need that.

50:14.870 --> 50:18.310
No, flat, flat.I can't get it flat.I've got to... Lance, mind out, mate.

50:18.310 --> 50:21.780
Rearranging the innards of the Alfa was tricky.'

50:21.780 --> 50:24.240
There are three bits to lift up?Yeah.

50:24.240 --> 50:27.350
Are you in?No.

50:27.350 --> 50:31.140
One minute 32 and the dogis still not in the car.

50:31.140 --> 50:36.950
Up, up. Up, Lance. Two minutes,nine seconds.

50:36.950 --> 50:39.600
In you get, in you get.There you go! Good boy.

50:39.600 --> 50:43.530
Oh, that's awkward.This is quite embarrassing now.

50:43.530 --> 50:47.340
Finally, Phil Drabble was ready to go.'

50:49.130 --> 50:52.820
Now, there's a racing start...and there's that.

50:52.820 --> 50:56.330
That's it, good boy!Your breath stinks. It's terrible.

50:57.180 --> 50:58.880
This is a brilliant test.

50:58.880 --> 51:02.050
There are eight million dogs in the UK.

51:02.050 --> 51:04.750
23% of all households have a dog.

51:07.240 --> 51:12.190
A car that can't handle a dog,frankly, is useless.

51:12.190 --> 51:15.460
Oh, God, it's all right.You're all right. Oh, good boy.

51:15.460 --> 51:17.260
It's the first Alfa to have Alfa Romeo's new DNA system.

51:17.260 --> 51:19.060
It's the first Alfa to have AlfaRomeo's new DNA system.

51:19.060 --> 51:22.830
What that means is you get a switch down here that says DNA.

51:22.830 --> 51:29.880
They stand for Normal, Dynamic -which tightens up and sharpensthe throttle.

51:29.880 --> 51:34.830
If you put it in All-weather,that lets the traction control knowit might get slippy.

51:34.830 --> 51:38.900
But, anxious not to be disqualifiedfor upsetting the dog,

51:38.900 --> 51:42.490
I left everything in very normal.'

51:42.490 --> 51:45.170
Seven minutes...Yeah. Now,I happen to know that,

51:45.170 --> 51:47.850
actually,that is a very good time

51:47.850 --> 51:51.150
for an Alfa Romeo Mito with a wolfhound on board.

51:52.430 --> 51:53.540
Does he look sad?

51:53.540 --> 51:54.660
No, I wouldn't say that's a sad dog.

51:54.660 --> 51:56.310
Bored out of his mind.

51:57.730 --> 52:02.730
Maybe my Great Dane would havea more exciting time.'Go.

52:02.730 --> 52:05.270
Come on, Milly, up, up.There you go. Look at that!

52:05.270 --> 52:09.610
There's a water tray for you.Oh, it leaks a bit.

52:09.610 --> 52:13.050
P11,500, you can lift the rear seats out,

52:13.050 --> 52:16.500
or fold them down. All I'm going to do is pull them forwards,

52:16.500 --> 52:20.820
which gives Milly a bit more room.

52:20.820 --> 52:23.970
Here we go.How do you feel now, dog?

52:23.970 --> 52:26.560
Yeah! What do you think of that?

52:26.560 --> 52:29.710
What it needs is a substantial snack halfway round the lap,

52:29.710 --> 52:32.870
say a leg...A head.

52:32.870 --> 52:35.630
This, of course,isn't really a Skoda.

52:35.630 --> 52:39.390
Peel away the body and underneath,at the front,it's a Volkswagen Polo.

52:39.390 --> 52:44.160
At the back, it's a Volkswagen Golf.The engine is from a Volkswagen.

52:44.160 --> 52:48.630
And it's so beautifully made.

52:48.630 --> 52:49.430
Sorry.

52:49.430 --> 52:55.810
Now, building up speed -dogs don't mind speedin a straight line - they love it!

52:55.810 --> 52:57.600
Dr Dolittle's on his way.

53:00.620 --> 53:04.150
Oh, it's not a lumpy yawn!

53:04.150 --> 53:08.740
Delighted! She's had light, space,air-conditioning...

53:08.740 --> 53:10.490
slobbered on the car,she loved it so much.

53:10.490 --> 53:12.250
.How do we know that wasn't you?

53:12.250 --> 53:13.530
Just tell me the time.

53:13.530 --> 53:15.640
Four minutes 13.Oh, God.

53:15.640 --> 53:19.510
Three minutes faster than you?!

53:19.510 --> 53:24.010
But would the Skoda be a match for the genius of the IQ?'

53:24.010 --> 53:29.170
This is one of the most cleverly packaged small cars in history.

53:29.170 --> 53:32.940
It is, in fact, the smallest four-seat car ever

53:32.940 --> 53:37.770
and it's all down to very innovative stuff, like the fuel tank, which is very shallow and very long,

53:37.770 --> 53:40.040
so it doesn't intrude in to the passenger space.

53:40.040 --> 53:43.830
The engine is the other way roundfrom other front-wheel drive cars,

53:43.830 --> 53:47.740
so the differential and the transmission are at the front.

53:47.740 --> 53:50.340
That saves more space down here.

53:50.340 --> 53:54.830
I think all this will stand me ingood stead with my enormous dog.

53:54.830 --> 53:58.610
Three, two, one...go!

53:59.270 --> 54:03.270
Right.

54:03.270 --> 54:06.080
There's no space at all!The seats go down.

54:06.080 --> 54:08.900
Can you stop interfering with my time?

54:08.900 --> 54:11.720
He can't get in! He can!He can't!

54:11.720 --> 54:14.180
He doesn't know whether to get inor mate with it!

54:14.180 --> 54:16.640
Alfie, come on.Drive like that and hope he can keep up?

54:16.640 --> 54:20.150
Alfie, come on. You can stick your head out the window.

54:20.150 --> 54:23.860
What are you doing?!That's no good!

54:23.860 --> 54:24.840
Sit up.

54:24.840 --> 54:27.240
Alfie! Good dog.

54:27.240 --> 54:29.860
Eventually,James's Hotpoint set off.'

54:30.470 --> 54:32.900
Oh, you've got gobon the gearstick!

54:34.790 --> 54:38.300
Of course, the IQ is a bit likea small, city supercar.

54:38.300 --> 54:42.020
The wheels are right on the corners,it's extremely agile.

54:42.020 --> 54:46.000
And it has a really small boot,like the Bugatti Veyron.

54:46.000 --> 54:46.780
Thanks for that.

54:46.780 --> 54:51.560
Nobody, unless they have no legs,could possibly sit in the back.

54:51.560 --> 54:53.840
Hold on, there's a bit of a...Oh, bloody hell!

54:53.840 --> 54:58.020
In James's hands, the dishwasherwas on a very slow cycle.'

54:58.900 --> 55:02.200
Gambon corner - he could spin off here at any point.

55:02.200 --> 55:06.390
Two dogs, coming across the line in a Hotpoint.Oh, no!

55:06.390 --> 55:08.460
Walkies, walkies.

55:08.460 --> 55:10.440
Oh, that isa miserable-looking dog!

55:10.440 --> 55:15.600
Look at that face!Oh, that'smaking me sad just looking at it!That's his normal face!

55:15.600 --> 55:16.820
You want to hear your time?

55:17.660 --> 55:20.090
Six forty-eight...?

55:20.090 --> 55:22.140
You beat an Alfa Romeo.

55:22.140 --> 55:26.180
That's the saddest-looking spectacle I've ever seen and it's your fault.

55:26.180 --> 55:30.140
If you're from the RSPCA, write tous at

55:30.140 --> 55:34.110
"James May is a bastard,Top Gear, London".

55:36.250 --> 55:37.600
With the score at one each

55:37.800 --> 55:41.660
we left the track and headed out into the real world.

55:42.480 --> 55:44.120
The idea's very simple.

55:44.120 --> 55:46.700
We shall drive to London to see which one looks best

55:46.800 --> 55:49.980
in the fashionable streets of Notting Hill.

55:52.860 --> 55:55.900
Well, it'll be mine. It just will.

55:55.900 --> 55:59.500
This is an Alfa Romeo, which is Latin for

55:59.600 --> 56:03.500
"yes, I will, but only because of your special car"

56:05.090 --> 56:07.620
Meanwhile, I'd unearthed a problem with this,

56:07.620 --> 56:10.160
the cheapest version of the Roomster.

56:10.160 --> 56:12.760
This just isn't powerful enough.

56:12.760 --> 56:15.090
There's never a gap big enough for you to pull out

56:15.100 --> 56:19.360
and get up to 70 before someone's caught you up.

56:19.360 --> 56:22.280
Here we go...foot hard down...

56:22.280 --> 56:28.510
Sorry, sorry. He's shaking his head and I don't blame him.

56:29.310 --> 56:33.660
In London, we pulled over for another real world test

56:33.660 --> 56:36.300
OK, we brimmed the tanks down at the track,

56:36.660 --> 56:39.110
so now we're in London,

56:39.110 --> 56:41.800
let's see who's used the least fuel.

56:41.800 --> 56:46.640
I don't feel all that confidenton this one.

56:46.640 --> 56:48.970
P4.16.

56:50.660 --> 56:56.670
The three-cylinder diesel engine...Yes?Follow me.

56:56.670 --> 56:59.510
Eh?What?! You have to mash your foot down

56:59.610 --> 57:01.000
just to do 20mph.

57:01.050 --> 57:03.050
And that's the result.

57:03.050 --> 57:05.550
You're better off with a bigger engine.

57:05.650 --> 57:07.540
Anyway, listen, I've got an idea.

57:07.650 --> 57:12.940
First one to see another one of their own cars wins.

57:12.940 --> 57:15.600
So, if in Notting Hill,you see an Alfa Mito...

57:15.600 --> 57:18.520
I'll go with that.

57:18.520 --> 57:22.870
As darkness fell, we began to near ciabatta central.

57:22.870 --> 57:24.710
Cor, this is posh round here.

57:25.880 --> 57:29.000
Richard Branson lives up here on the right-hand side.

57:29.100 --> 57:31.800
Does he have a Roomster?

57:31.800 --> 57:33.970
Nnnnnno.

57:35.300 --> 57:37.300
We're about to penetrate Notting Hill, James.

57:37.500 --> 57:39.000
We'll go round that bend,

57:39.050 --> 57:42.020
it will be a wash with brand-new IQs.

57:44.150 --> 57:46.550
He was wrong.

57:46.550 --> 57:48.480
We all were.

57:51.440 --> 57:55.050
Fiat 500, Fiat 500...

57:55.050 --> 58:00.920
Fiat 500, Fiat 500...Fiat 500.

58:16.190 --> 58:20.380
Now, there's a very good reason why I chose the Skoda Roomster

58:20.380 --> 58:21.810
rather than the Fiat 500 as the best cheap car in Britain.

58:21.810 --> 58:23.250
rather than the Fiat 500 as the best cheap car in Britain.

58:23.250 --> 58:28.160
It's because, quite simply,I forgot about the Fiat.

58:32.130 --> 58:37.000
But...what if you want a car that begins with A?

58:38.160 --> 58:42.560
So, there we are. If you want a small, cheap, good-looking,practical car

58:42.560 --> 58:47.150
that's fast, economical and can carry a St Bernard, remember...

58:47.150 --> 58:49.730
we know nothing.

58:57.410 --> 59:01.990
If we'd have done more minutes of research...

59:01.990 --> 59:05.610
we'd have remembered it.We are numpties, aren't we?

59:05.800 --> 59:09.320
If we did a travel programme,we'd finish up by saying,

59:09.320 --> 59:12.260
"And there you are, the best place to go on holiday in Europe is Belgium."

59:12.260 --> 59:15.360
"Oh, no, we forgot France!"

59:15.360 --> 59:19.830
I don't like the Fiat 500. Oh, God.Or France.

59:19.830 --> 59:21.500
That really isn't a bombshell,is it?

59:21.500 --> 59:23.000
But, we do have a couple next week,

59:23.050 --> 59:25.210
because these two have a race with Postman Pat

59:25.210 --> 59:27.110
and I declare war on the British Army!

59:27.210 --> 59:30.210
See you then. Take care.Good night!
