00:04.070 --> 00:06.365
We are not
selling, no matter what you do!

00:06.500 --> 00:08.325
They got to be worth
millions of dollars, Hannibal.

00:08.392 --> 00:11.745
The mission gives us a chance
to take care of ourselves.

00:11.828 --> 00:15.833
I'm gonna get that old folks' land.
And I'm going to get you.

00:15.918 --> 00:17.501
Sounds like a threat to me.

00:17.543 --> 00:22.256
And I'd like to know what this A-Team
you brought in is gonna do about it.

00:24.958 --> 00:27.970
Pathfinder rides again.

00:31.890 --> 00:34.309
<i>In 1972,
a crack commando unit...</i>

00:34.393 --> 00:35.936
<i>was sent to prison
by a military court...</i>

00:35.978 --> 00:37.521
<i>for a crime they didn't commit.</i>

00:37.604 --> 00:38.939
<i>These men promptly escaped...</i>

00:38.981 --> 00:40.524
<i>from a maximum-security
stockade...</i>

00:40.607 --> 00:42.276
<i>to the Los Angeles underground.</i>

00:42.401 --> 00:43.986
<i>Today, still wanted
by the government...</i>

00:44.069 --> 00:45.946
<i>they survive
as soldiers of fortune.</i>

00:46.029 --> 00:48.490
<i>If you have a problem,
if no one else can help...</i>

00:48.574 --> 00:49.741
<i>and if you can find them...</i>

00:49.867 --> 00:52.327
<i>maybe you can hire the A-Team.</i>

<i>As we enter the
Moultrie battlegrounds...</i>

02:13.325 --> 02:17.329
<i>be sure not to miss the last stronghold
of the settlers in this area...</i>

02:17.412 --> 02:20.624
<i>the Mission de la Paz,
the Mission of Peace.</i>

02:21.458 --> 02:25.337
<i>The bloodiest battle in American
history took place right here...</i>

02:25.379 --> 02:27.464
<i>in 1843...</i>

02:27.589 --> 02:30.884
<i>just after John C. Moultrie
and his friends...</i>

02:30.968 --> 02:33.303
<i>settled
in the Prairie Creek area.</i>

02:33.470 --> 02:34.805
<i>Chief Matsego...</i>

02:34.972 --> 02:39.268
<i>led
3,000 Akantu Indian braves...</i>

02:39.351 --> 02:42.729
<i>against the settlement
in March of that year.</i>

02:42.813 --> 02:46.900
<i>Every man, woman, and child
was wiped out.</i>

02:46.984 --> 02:50.988
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, please watch
your step as you get off the tram.</i>

02:55.742 --> 03:00.205
<i>The tram will return to town as
soon as it is loaded. Thank you.</i>

03:09.298 --> 03:11.800
- Let's go. We wanna see the tour.
- Yeah, we got tickets.

03:12.050 --> 03:14.511
The tour will start just
as soon as the tram is filled.

03:14.594 --> 03:15.887
Would you please
take your seats?

03:16.221 --> 03:18.223
You've got enough people,
old lady.

03:20.976 --> 03:22.602
Now, you go...

03:22.728 --> 03:24.062
Oh, Mickey!

03:24.646 --> 03:25.480
Mickey!

03:25.564 --> 03:26.648
Come on, let's go for a ride!

03:26.732 --> 03:28.275
Yeah, you ready, babe?

03:42.247 --> 03:43.915
Get back, get back!

03:47.252 --> 03:49.588
Oh! He's gotta be kidding.

04:05.020 --> 04:06.438
Are you all right?
Yes.

04:06.521 --> 04:09.900
You animals.
You dirty, filthy animals.

04:10.150 --> 04:11.234
I know who sent you.

04:11.360 --> 04:14.696
And you can tell Ashton we are not
selling, no matter what you do!

04:14.946 --> 04:16.615
I never heard of an Ashton.

04:16.865 --> 04:18.116
I'll tell you one thing,
though...

04:18.241 --> 04:20.202
I think you ought to get out
of the tourist business.

04:20.369 --> 04:23.330
You don't seem to be attracting
a very good clientele.

04:26.458 --> 04:27.834
Come on, dear.

05:49.374 --> 05:51.460
Okay, Hannibal.
She's got the handles.

05:51.835 --> 05:54.921
Let's see if this lie detector
of yours works, B.A.

06:26.578 --> 06:28.288
I think she's
telling the truth, Hannibal.

06:30.040 --> 06:31.249
Let's go get her.

06:32.501 --> 06:34.628
We just want a little brew
money, old lady. That's all.

06:34.703 --> 06:36.872
Couple of rounds of beers here
for me and my buddies.

06:36.963 --> 06:38.048
Don't take that.
That's got all my...

06:38.089 --> 06:39.925
Whoa! What's that?

06:42.135 --> 06:44.554
We're talking
some heavy partying here!

06:44.679 --> 06:47.307
Now, give that back to me.
That isn't my money.

06:47.432 --> 06:48.767
Now give it back to me.

06:48.975 --> 06:52.354
If it doesn't belong to you, then
it must belong to us, right?

06:52.437 --> 06:53.438
Wrong.

06:54.981 --> 06:56.858
Really? Says who?

07:11.748 --> 07:15.335
Now, if you wanna throw a party, you
have to invite the right people.

07:32.310 --> 07:35.021
Ooh, this harassment began...

07:35.605 --> 07:36.940
four months ago.

07:37.649 --> 07:39.067
Up until then...

07:39.401 --> 07:42.946
Mr. Ashton and his men
gave us no trouble at all.

07:43.071 --> 07:45.657
Then, one day, Ashton
comes to me and asks me--

07:45.782 --> 07:47.617
He didn't ask. He threatened.

07:47.701 --> 07:49.744
Tell him, Rudy.
Tell him what he said.

07:49.953 --> 07:53.456
Actually, what he said was,
"Sell out to me...

07:53.540 --> 07:55.667
"or ride in a coffin."

07:55.834 --> 07:57.294
Sounds like a threat to me.

07:57.460 --> 07:59.337
Ashton wants the land,
all right.

07:59.421 --> 08:03.800
Rudy's family has owned this land
for, oh, almost a hundred years.

08:04.134 --> 08:07.345
Now, Ashton owns all the land
around us.

08:07.887 --> 08:12.559
He said that he wanted to expand
his ranch by buying up our land.

08:12.684 --> 08:15.186
He gets his jollies
out of beating up old folks...

08:15.312 --> 08:18.273
the little no good, low down, son of a--
- Babette.

08:18.398 --> 08:20.066
Well, he does.

08:20.233 --> 08:22.902
And he put poor Mickey
in the hospital.

08:23.153 --> 08:27.991
And I'd like to know what this A-Team
you brought in is gonna do about it.

08:28.158 --> 08:30.160
First thing we're gonna do is
give him a pop in the eye...

08:30.243 --> 08:31.703
to let him know things
are gonna be different.

08:31.786 --> 08:34.623
I like that.
I really like that.

08:35.457 --> 08:36.916
Oh, drat.

08:37.583 --> 08:40.837
Well, break's over.
Back to work, everybody.

08:40.962 --> 08:42.756
- Come on.
- Many moons ago my people were young.

08:42.797 --> 08:44.841
Save it for the tourists, Chief.

08:46.384 --> 08:48.094
Well, something has to be done.

08:48.178 --> 08:50.388
Without this home,
we've no place to go.

08:50.764 --> 08:52.390
And without the tourists...

08:54.017 --> 08:56.269
We can't pay our bills
the way things are.

08:56.978 --> 09:00.398
Murdock, you and B.A. check this place out.
See if it's defensible.

09:00.523 --> 09:02.609
Face, we need a few things.

09:02.734 --> 09:04.027
Ah, yeah.

09:05.070 --> 09:10.533
40 gallons red paint, seven electric
fans, three loudspeakers, 40 pillows.

09:10.825 --> 09:12.118
Is this a joke?

09:25.548 --> 09:27.926
I really appreciate this,
Mr. Peck.

09:28.051 --> 09:31.971
I mean, I've heard a lot about
your abilities to scavenge.

09:32.138 --> 09:33.682
Uh, huh. Yeah, right.

09:33.765 --> 09:36.142
Let's see... Houston...
Dallas... Paris...

09:36.226 --> 09:41.648
main office number
555-3843, closed on...

09:42.315 --> 09:44.484
Okay, all right.
Now, you...

09:44.567 --> 09:47.821
stay in the background and watch and
try not to get in the way, okay?

09:47.904 --> 09:49.531
- Heaven forbid.
- Good.

09:59.499 --> 10:04.003
Hi, there. Hey, look, is that the
paint I'm supposed to pick up?

10:04.087 --> 10:05.922
- Paint? What paint?
- Right there.

10:06.047 --> 10:08.633
See... Look, I haven't got
much time, you know...

10:08.717 --> 10:11.678
the main office sent me over to
get 40 gallons of high gloss...

10:11.761 --> 10:14.431
robin's red latex paint to
take over to the Dallas store.

10:14.514 --> 10:17.434
Or was it the Houston st-- No,
Houston gets the weed-eaters.

10:17.475 --> 10:18.893
Look, I'm in kind of
a hurry here.

10:18.977 --> 10:21.646
I don't know anything about a
paint transfer, I'm sorry.

10:21.855 --> 10:22.897
- You don't?
- No, sir.

10:22.981 --> 10:24.441
- No invoice?
- Nothing.

10:25.522 --> 10:28.945
Dadgumit, that's the third time
they've done that to me this week.

10:29.028 --> 10:32.031
Look, why don't you just call
Janet down at the main office.

10:32.157 --> 10:34.033
Ask her yourself.
You know the number?

10:34.117 --> 10:36.911
555-3346.

10:37.537 --> 10:39.998
You got that? It's five--
Oh, you got it. Okay.

10:41.082 --> 10:43.084
<i>Hello, you've reached our
main office. We're closed today.</i>

10:43.126 --> 10:44.419
<i>Please call back tomorrow...</i>

10:44.669 --> 10:47.589
Sorry, all I get is a recording.
The office is closed today.

10:47.756 --> 10:51.050
Can you believe it? Oh, that's right,
it's Monday. They're closed on Monday.

10:51.468 --> 10:55.054
Well, look, I tell you what, why don't
you just let me take this stuff...

10:55.138 --> 10:56.681
and have them send you
an invoice.

10:56.765 --> 10:58.558
Hold it right there.

10:58.892 --> 11:01.811
Don't you dare give this paint
to anyone.

11:01.895 --> 11:03.938
What the heck
is going on here, anyway?

11:04.063 --> 11:06.941
Langford Simpson,
Environmental Control Agency.

11:07.108 --> 11:10.445
Those cans of high gloss
robin's red latex paint...

11:10.528 --> 11:12.655
are laced with lead!

11:12.906 --> 11:16.785
Obviously you chose to ignore the
recall that we sent to you last week...

11:17.118 --> 11:19.496
about the poisoned children
in El Paso.

11:19.621 --> 11:21.456
Hey, I didn't know anything
about this.

11:21.539 --> 11:23.082
Right. I'll bet.

11:23.291 --> 11:27.212
Well, regardless, I'm here
to take this poison away.

11:27.712 --> 11:29.506
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.

11:31.341 --> 11:33.134
Rudy, Rudy, Rudy...

11:33.218 --> 11:35.970
if I'd have needed any help,
I would have asked.

11:36.095 --> 11:37.639
Well, we got everything,
didn't we?

11:37.722 --> 11:39.724
But that's not the point.

11:40.517 --> 11:43.520
You see, these scams,
they're very, very delicate.

11:43.603 --> 11:46.189
It takes a certain kind
of finesse.

11:46.356 --> 11:47.649
See? To pull them off.

11:47.816 --> 11:49.400
I thought I was helping.

11:51.569 --> 11:53.321
I'm sorry, Mr. Peck.

11:53.404 --> 11:56.449
But you see, Rudy has always
been our provider.

11:56.574 --> 12:00.245
If it wasn't for him, most of
us would be in state-run homes.

12:00.537 --> 12:03.581
So, please be kind to him.

12:03.998 --> 12:04.916
Okay.

12:05.542 --> 12:08.002
Well, a good day's work, Face.

12:08.127 --> 12:09.754
Oh, yeah.
It's a good day's work.

12:09.879 --> 12:11.506
Let's get B.A.
and get this show on the road.

12:11.589 --> 12:13.925
♪ Old Faceman,
he ain't what he used to be ♪

12:14.050 --> 12:16.636
♪ Ain't what he used to be,
ain't what he used to be ♪

12:22.642 --> 12:23.977
<i>Ladies and Gentlemen...</i>

12:24.102 --> 12:26.479
<i>would you please gather
in front of the mission...</i>

12:26.646 --> 12:30.775
<i>for a treat you wouldn't believe
possible for the few pennies you paid.</i>

12:31.317 --> 12:34.988
<i>A demonstration of
the law of the West.</i>

12:35.655 --> 12:40.326
<i>For many years, the white man lived
peacefully with the red man.</i>

12:40.535 --> 12:43.037
<i>But there were renegades
on both sides.</i>

12:43.329 --> 12:46.124
<i>And war broke out
between these two people.</i>

12:46.749 --> 12:50.295
<i>On one side,
the mighty Chief Watashi!</i>

12:56.551 --> 13:00.597
<i>And from the settlers,
a man who knew no fear.</i>

13:00.805 --> 13:03.516
<i>A man who rode
the wind of destiny.</i>

13:03.933 --> 13:05.351
<i>None other than...</i>

13:06.561 --> 13:09.731
<i>Daniel David Bowie
Boone Murdock.</i>

13:10.398 --> 13:13.401
<i>Known to his friends
as Pathfinder!</i>

13:21.159 --> 13:24.120
All right, that's it.
I warned you.

13:24.287 --> 13:25.830
Hit the road, Cochise.

13:26.372 --> 13:27.916
You leave him alone.

13:28.958 --> 13:30.209
Come on, Chief.

13:31.419 --> 13:34.172
Hey, you bear-greased badgers!

13:34.297 --> 13:38.551
I'm not taking too kindly to the way
you're talking to our womenfolk.

13:40.970 --> 13:43.431
The funny guy wants
to put on a show.

13:46.434 --> 13:48.144
Go get him, Pathfinder.

13:56.027 --> 13:57.862
Hannibal!

13:58.196 --> 13:59.614
Hit it, B.A.

14:36.567 --> 14:38.194
And that,
ladies and gentlemen...

14:38.277 --> 14:41.114
will be the end of this
afternoon's performance.

14:46.077 --> 14:47.578
I don't know what to tell you.

14:47.704 --> 14:50.123
- Where did they get that kind of muscle?
- I don't know.

14:50.289 --> 14:53.584
Those old geezers were ready to roll over
and play dead until these guys showed up.

14:53.668 --> 14:56.087
Now, I don't know who they are,
they just took us by surprise.

14:56.337 --> 14:57.922
We got a time limit
on this thing.

14:58.006 --> 14:59.966
We can't sit around and play
ball with these old folks.

15:00.049 --> 15:02.010
They gotta be out of that mission
by the end of the month.

15:02.635 --> 15:04.554
I gotta go talk to Taggert
about this.

15:05.221 --> 15:06.639
Don't touch the car.

15:06.931 --> 15:08.266
Why don't you get cleaned up?

15:19.193 --> 15:20.987
I don't go for this farm bit.

15:21.654 --> 15:24.574
I think somebody got to Ashton
and talked him into a land grab.

15:24.741 --> 15:27.118
Well, it wasn't for the mineral
rights, I'll tell you that...

15:27.243 --> 15:29.746
because I done checked with
the County Assayer's Office...

15:29.829 --> 15:33.374
and they rated this piece of God's
acre as a mere "okey-dokey."

15:33.499 --> 15:34.834
It's nothing
to get excited about.

15:34.917 --> 15:36.085
Historic value?

15:36.169 --> 15:38.755
Ashton said he wanted
to bulldoze this mission.

15:38.838 --> 15:41.591
But there's a Federal agency
to preserve historic sites.

15:41.716 --> 15:43.301
The Department of the Interior.

15:43.426 --> 15:47.555
The only problem is, they don't
consider us an historical site.

15:48.056 --> 15:50.016
We've applied
for Federal status...

15:50.058 --> 15:51.893
but they have never answered
any of our letters.

15:51.976 --> 15:54.020
They don't even return
Rudy's phone calls.

15:54.062 --> 15:56.647
Oh, departmental red tape
is all it is.

15:56.773 --> 15:59.776
Darn bureaucrats. You know
how the government is.

15:59.859 --> 16:02.278
Okay, Face, you and Murdock go
down to the Federal Building...

16:02.320 --> 16:03.863
and see if you can push
the paperwork through.

16:03.946 --> 16:07.366
When you get that done, Ashton couldn't
bulldoze it even if he owned it.

16:07.492 --> 16:09.827
Uh, do you mind if I tag along?

16:09.952 --> 16:13.498
I mean, I had such a great time when
we went looking for the red paint.

16:14.082 --> 16:16.000
Well, not this time, huh, Rudy?

16:16.084 --> 16:18.503
I think Murdock and I
can handle it. Huh, Murdock?

16:18.628 --> 16:22.882
The slinky of destiny is making it's way
right on back up to the top of the stairs.

16:23.691 --> 16:25.595
It's beginning to make
sense to me now, Face.

16:25.620 --> 16:26.743
Ah, it is?

16:26.928 --> 16:30.431
Yes. You know, all the
stories that my grandmother...

16:30.598 --> 16:34.811
H. Emma Murdock, used to tell me
about my great, great granddaddy...

16:34.936 --> 16:37.188
when I was just a little Captain?
They were true.

16:37.563 --> 16:40.817
'Cause the last time my grand daddy
was seen, he was making his way...

16:40.900 --> 16:41.943
right into Texas.

16:42.026 --> 16:43.528
And you know what that means,
hmm?

16:43.611 --> 16:45.905
It means, that he was
right here...

16:46.030 --> 16:50.034
fighting alongside of John
Moultrie and the other settlers...

16:50.118 --> 16:51.994
defending the mission.
And now...

16:52.245 --> 16:56.415
just a few generations later, the
Murdock clan is being called upon...

16:56.707 --> 16:58.793
to defend Mission de la Paz.

17:03.339 --> 17:07.593
I'm gonna go wash down them horses and I'm
gonna put some jerky in them cases...

17:07.885 --> 17:10.637
just in case we have a camp
without a fire.

17:11.222 --> 17:12.431
Excuse me.

17:17.690 --> 17:23.025
No, no, no, really,
he comes in handy sometimes.

17:24.277 --> 17:27.571
Well, what do we do now?
Just wait?

17:28.071 --> 17:32.326
Not long. I figure Ashton's
pretty jumpy by now,

17:32.660 --> 17:34.453
and he should be running
to Daddy.

17:34.996 --> 17:36.789
And Daddy is who we want.

17:37.081 --> 17:39.458
Are you telling me I should start
worrying about my investment?

17:39.542 --> 17:41.460
No, out of nowhere,
Mr. Taggert.

17:41.544 --> 17:44.422
Those guys came down on my
boys like a sack of lead.

17:44.505 --> 17:47.675
- I just need more time, that's all.
- There is no time.

17:48.634 --> 17:51.971
Either you get that land soon,
or the whole deal falls through.

17:52.096 --> 17:53.598
They'll go somewhere else.

18:17.038 --> 18:19.165
- Thanks for the ride, darling.
- You're welcome.

18:22.084 --> 18:23.502
They've been in there
for an hour.

18:23.920 --> 18:26.172
I would have been here sooner,
B.A., but...

18:27.006 --> 18:30.593
But the old lady wouldn't floor
the accelerator. I don't speed.

18:30.927 --> 18:33.387
- You wanted her to speed, Hannibal?
- Who's the guy?

18:33.721 --> 18:36.140
I don't know, Hannibal.
He met Ashton here.

18:36.390 --> 18:37.975
That's his car parked
over there.

18:38.059 --> 18:40.436
He locked his briefcase in
the trunk before he went in.

18:40.853 --> 18:42.230
Check that briefcase out.

18:42.605 --> 18:44.732
I'm gonna pay Ashton
and his friend a visit.

18:44.857 --> 18:47.068
Babette, you stay here.

19:01.123 --> 19:02.708
Hi there, Ashton old buddy.

19:03.042 --> 19:04.252
Who the hell are you?

19:05.086 --> 19:07.296
I'm the new caretaker
of the old mission...

19:07.421 --> 19:09.382
and the guy who's going to
make your life miserable.

19:09.715 --> 19:11.842
Hi there.
We haven't met before.

19:11.884 --> 19:15.221
I don't know who you are, but you're
digging a grave for yourself.

19:15.763 --> 19:18.307
Really?
Well, let's talk about that.

19:18.557 --> 19:23.312
Now, that's the hammer of a 9mm 8-round
automatic pointed right at your belly.

19:23.896 --> 19:25.356
Hollow point in the chamber.

19:29.068 --> 19:31.529
How does a guy get a cup of coffee
around here? Do you know, pal?

19:46.168 --> 19:48.504
What are you doing?
We didn't hire you to steal.

19:48.629 --> 19:51.090
This ain't stealing.
Here, look at these.

19:51.132 --> 19:52.842
You're the thief.
You look at them.

19:56.762 --> 19:59.974
Now the mission is about to be
declared a national treasure.

20:00.057 --> 20:02.643
And until that happens,
I'm going to be around...

20:02.685 --> 20:05.146
to see to it that you guys
keep your hands off.

20:05.229 --> 20:06.439
Let me tell you something.

20:06.522 --> 20:11.235
I'm gonna get that old folks' land.
And I'm going to get you, got it?

20:17.700 --> 20:21.370
Almost time for the afternoon performance.
It's been charming.

20:22.204 --> 20:23.164
Hey.

20:24.957 --> 20:26.584
Don't you think
it's been charming?

20:33.174 --> 20:34.884
That guy is dead.

20:35.009 --> 20:36.761
Just tell your men
to get ready to move.

20:45.603 --> 20:49.398
So, as you can see, being the
Undersecretary's Secretary...

20:49.482 --> 20:52.735
to the Assistant in charge of the Secretaries
for the Department of the Interior...

20:52.818 --> 20:55.404
is a very demanding job.

20:55.488 --> 20:58.240
But then, of course, someone
as astute as yourself...

20:58.324 --> 21:00.493
doesn't have to be told that,
now, does she? No.

21:00.868 --> 21:04.872
I believe, what my friend is
trying to get across to you...

21:04.997 --> 21:07.124
is that these are very
important documents...

21:07.208 --> 21:11.295
that must get to the Great White
Father in Washington, D.C.

21:11.379 --> 21:16.050
They concern the settlers
at Mission de la Paz.

21:16.175 --> 21:19.887
Precisely. So, you see,
it's highly imperative...

21:19.970 --> 21:23.432
that these be sent to the Secretary
for the Department of Interior.

21:23.516 --> 21:26.435
As a matter of fact, you might want
to put the Federal seal on them...

21:26.519 --> 21:28.687
and mark them confidential.

21:28.813 --> 21:30.731
Oh! Oh, yes!
That's a good idea!

21:30.856 --> 21:32.942
- Maybe, send them Express, huh?
- Even better!

21:33.067 --> 21:34.402
Pony Express.

21:34.735 --> 21:36.612
I'll get
the necessary documents.

21:37.488 --> 21:39.281
Could you cool with
the Pathfinder stuff?

21:39.365 --> 21:40.574
I can't.

21:40.699 --> 21:41.873
It's genetic.

21:41.898 --> 21:42.843
Genetic...

21:42.868 --> 21:44.453
Would you just sign these
right here, please?

21:44.537 --> 21:45.788
Yes, certainly.

21:47.460 --> 21:50.042
There you go. A pleasure.

22:00.052 --> 22:01.512
Excuse me, miss.

22:02.179 --> 22:05.975
My name is Randall Corn, and I work
with the Secretary of the Interior.

22:06.100 --> 22:07.852
Oh, really?
What a coincidence.

22:08.018 --> 22:10.729
These forms should've actually
come to my office.

22:11.272 --> 22:12.857
Otherwise, it'll just come back.

22:17.528 --> 22:19.822
It was blatant vandalism.

22:19.947 --> 22:21.824
Oh, no, Babette,
it wasn't vandalism.

22:21.949 --> 22:26.537
Well, I don't know what else you'd call it
when somebody forcibly breaks into your car.

22:28.998 --> 22:30.749
Hello, hello.

22:30.774 --> 22:31.750
Hello.

22:38.549 --> 22:42.636
So that's it, Hannibal. Rudy walked right
in there and just took back the papers.

22:42.928 --> 22:45.431
It's no wonder this place hasn't
been declared an historic site.

22:45.514 --> 22:46.473
He keeps blocking it.

22:46.557 --> 22:49.476
You know, Hannibal. This
doesn't make any sense to me.

22:49.685 --> 22:51.937
I mean, Rudy's grandfather...

22:52.021 --> 22:55.482
fought right along side my
great, great grandfather...

22:55.566 --> 22:57.568
in defense of this mission.

22:57.693 --> 22:59.236
He died for this land.

22:59.361 --> 23:01.822
It's hard to believe Rudy's
in cahoots with Ashton.

23:02.406 --> 23:04.450
B.A., what about the
material from the briefcase?

23:04.533 --> 23:06.577
Were there any check stubs
with Rudy's name on it?

23:06.702 --> 23:08.913
No, Hannibal. They was
all made out to Ashton.

23:09.038 --> 23:11.457
So, some guy named
Bart Taggert...

23:11.832 --> 23:14.084
of the Unified
Survey Corporation...

23:14.168 --> 23:16.712
is making out checks
in large amounts to Ashton.

23:16.795 --> 23:18.714
It's got to be
a dummy corporation.

23:19.089 --> 23:22.009
At least that's what I'd do if I was
setting up a land grab, you see?

23:22.176 --> 23:24.553
And I'll bet you that, that
guy you saw with Ashton...

23:24.637 --> 23:25.721
was probably Taggert.

23:25.846 --> 23:29.058
Hannibal, I just had
a horrifying thought.

23:29.225 --> 23:31.143
Now, just assume...

23:31.227 --> 23:33.729
that Rudy really is
working for Ashton.

23:33.812 --> 23:36.565
That means he knows
who we really are.

23:36.607 --> 23:37.650
<i>All right, Smith...</i>

23:37.775 --> 23:39.443
<i>we've got the entire
place surrounded.</i>

23:39.568 --> 23:41.987
- <i>Throw out your weapons and come on out.</i> 
- Wonderful.

23:43.948 --> 23:45.658
But, we asked them here.

23:45.741 --> 23:46.742
Listen, lady,
they're criminals...

23:46.867 --> 23:48.619
and they're going to go to jail.
You understand me?

23:48.953 --> 23:50.204
Hey, Smith!

23:50.537 --> 23:52.248
Don't make us come in shooting.

23:52.498 --> 23:55.251
Okay, General. You've got us.

23:55.793 --> 23:56.877
We're coming out.

24:06.512 --> 24:07.721
Check the house for weapons.

24:07.805 --> 24:10.224
Hello, Fulbright.
I've missed you.

24:10.557 --> 24:12.226
That's very funny, Smith.

24:12.309 --> 24:14.353
The three of you can laugh
all you want to, but...

24:14.561 --> 24:16.855
there'll be no rabbit coming
out of the hat this time.

24:17.106 --> 24:19.525
All right men, let's go.
Excuse us, grandmother.

25:12.077 --> 25:15.664
I've always felt that February
was our best month for escapes.

25:15.748 --> 25:18.375
It's such a short month, but...
What do you think, Face?

25:18.459 --> 25:20.961
I prefer the spring months.
March, April--

25:21.045 --> 25:23.213
Shut up, all of you. You'll have
plenty of time to talk in Leavenworth.

25:23.255 --> 25:24.757
Sir, we found their van.

25:24.882 --> 25:26.300
- Have it brought around.
- Yes, sir.

25:26.800 --> 25:29.303
Your last ride, Smith. In that
pretty little van of yours.

25:29.386 --> 25:30.971
Then we're gonna
cut it up for scrap.

25:31.555 --> 25:32.765
Whatever you say, General.

25:32.848 --> 25:34.850
And just one other thing,
so you know.

25:34.933 --> 25:37.811
This time my men have removed
all of the weapons from it.

25:42.358 --> 25:43.275
Wait!

25:44.318 --> 25:45.361
All aboard.

25:53.786 --> 25:55.412
Come on, after them!
Let's go!

26:04.630 --> 26:05.756
There they go.

26:10.761 --> 26:11.887
Let's go.

26:30.447 --> 26:32.157
Come on, let's go! Hurry up!

27:09.236 --> 27:11.071
Tell your men
to lay down their arms.

27:15.325 --> 27:16.743
Lay down your arms!

27:19.496 --> 27:20.998
You know something, Fulbright?

27:21.832 --> 27:23.459
You're too dedicated.

27:23.750 --> 27:25.544
You should go away for a while.

27:30.132 --> 27:32.301
You're never gonna
get away with this, Smith.

27:33.469 --> 27:34.928
I'll get you. You wait!

27:35.304 --> 27:36.930
I'm gonna get you, Smith.

27:37.347 --> 27:39.224
- Let me out of here!
- I know.

27:39.308 --> 27:40.934
Smith!
I know, Fulbright.

27:41.018 --> 27:43.562
We'll never get
away with it, right?

27:44.521 --> 27:47.107
And if you find work,
send money.

27:48.108 --> 27:50.152
Smith! Smith, you hear me?

27:50.694 --> 27:52.237
You better get me out of here.

28:35.697 --> 28:37.699
They burned down the house,
Hannibal.

29:09.648 --> 29:12.359
I don't know. What do you tell
people who've lost everything?

29:16.238 --> 29:19.157
I should have just sold out
to Ashton in the first place.

29:19.283 --> 29:21.868
I had no right to
put these people in danger.

29:22.160 --> 29:24.496
And now. Well,
we've lost everything.

29:24.663 --> 29:26.415
Rudy, don't blame yourself.

29:26.540 --> 29:28.041
We all made our own decision.

29:28.125 --> 29:29.960
None of us was ready
to give up our home.

29:30.085 --> 29:32.546
It doesn't matter.
There is no home now.

29:32.879 --> 29:34.381
There's only ashes.

29:34.798 --> 29:37.050
That was a picture
of my husband.

29:37.509 --> 29:39.511
Nora, where am I going to go?

29:39.553 --> 29:41.054
It's all right, it's all right.

29:41.179 --> 29:42.889
We can't win, Hannibal.

29:43.015 --> 29:45.058
And we can't afford
to fight anymore.

29:45.225 --> 29:46.935
You can't afford not to fight.

29:55.944 --> 29:58.739
All right, Mr. Smith.
You're in charge.

29:58.864 --> 30:00.282
What do you want us to do?

30:00.657 --> 30:02.576
First, a place to live.

30:03.160 --> 30:04.870
The Mission de la Paz.

30:06.496 --> 30:08.290
The fire warped
all the weapons, Hannibal.

30:08.373 --> 30:09.541
It totaled the tram, too.

30:09.625 --> 30:12.085
These men defiled the
territory of my forefathers...

30:12.169 --> 30:15.547
and I request permission to show
them the business end of my musket.

30:15.672 --> 30:18.884
In due time, Captain. First, I want
to ask Rudy a couple of questions.

30:18.967 --> 30:20.135
It is Rudy, isn't it?

30:20.218 --> 30:21.595
What are you talking about?

30:21.720 --> 30:22.888
Face.

30:25.265 --> 30:27.726
- That's my wallet.
- That's right.

30:28.644 --> 30:30.437
Charles Winston.

30:31.563 --> 30:32.689
Wait a minute.

30:33.023 --> 30:36.735
Charles Win... The Charles Winston?
You're Charlie the Clip?

30:36.860 --> 30:38.445
You picked my pocket.

30:38.528 --> 30:40.822
You know, I can't believe it. I picked
the pocket of Charlie the Clip.

30:40.906 --> 30:43.825
Do you know who this is? I studied
every scam you've ever done.

30:43.909 --> 30:47.120
This is the guy who sold the
Brooklyn Bridge to Brooklyn.

30:47.204 --> 30:49.247
A few minor accomplishments.

30:49.373 --> 30:51.500
Charlie, I never
figured you for a sellout.

30:51.625 --> 30:53.085
Why'd you call Fulbright
in on us?

30:53.168 --> 30:55.504
If you didn't want
our help, why hire us?

30:55.754 --> 30:57.631
- Call in Fulbright?
- Yeah.

30:57.714 --> 31:00.509
I never even heard of the man
until he knocked on my door.

31:00.634 --> 31:02.386
I swear I had
nothing to do with it.

31:02.552 --> 31:04.513
A part of your story
doesn't track, Rudy.

31:04.554 --> 31:06.139
If you're not
working for Ashton...

31:06.390 --> 31:07.933
why are you trying
to block the effort...

31:08.016 --> 31:09.601
to establish this site...

31:09.893 --> 31:11.561
as a historical monument?

31:12.396 --> 31:13.814
After everything
that's happened...

31:13.897 --> 31:15.857
I guess I should be
straight with you guys.

31:16.274 --> 31:19.152
I didn't want those papers
to go through to Washington.

31:19.403 --> 31:21.947
If anyone ever did
any research on this place...

31:22.030 --> 31:23.573
they'd find out that...

31:24.574 --> 31:26.993
the Mission de la Paz
doesn't actually exist.

31:27.119 --> 31:29.955
Wait a minute. You mean,
this whole thing is a scam?

31:30.038 --> 31:31.998
You invented
the Mission de la Paz?

31:32.124 --> 31:34.459
You mean, there was never
no Jonathan Moultrie?

31:34.543 --> 31:35.544
That's right.

31:35.669 --> 31:39.214
That means there never was
no Daniel David Bowie...

31:39.297 --> 31:40.882
Boone Pathfinder.

31:41.007 --> 31:43.301
It's not true.
It's not true.

31:43.427 --> 31:45.971
My daddy opened this place
as a social club...

31:46.096 --> 31:47.639
in 1924.

31:47.764 --> 31:50.267
Called it the
"Church of Divine Pleasure."

31:50.475 --> 31:52.102
Before that it was a stable.

31:52.227 --> 31:54.604
That's lies. It's lies.

31:54.730 --> 31:57.149
I won those
cannons in a poker game.

31:57.232 --> 32:01.153
They were placed at the entrance to
the local library in Muncie, Indiana.

32:01.445 --> 32:02.988
The pews were...

32:03.196 --> 32:04.865
bus benches in Chicago.

32:04.948 --> 32:07.951
Everywhere I went I collected
pieces of the legend.

32:09.035 --> 32:10.287
I'm sorry, Murdock.

32:10.412 --> 32:12.956
What about Chief Watashi
and the Akantu Indians?

32:13.039 --> 32:14.291
No such animals.

32:14.374 --> 32:16.668
I picked the Chief up
hitchhiking in Cleveland.

32:16.793 --> 32:19.713
Trying to avoid the daddy
of a old girlfriend.

32:20.172 --> 32:22.299
I can't believe I fell
for a Cleveland Indian.

32:22.424 --> 32:23.592
Well...

32:24.551 --> 32:26.636
to be completely frank, Face...

32:27.095 --> 32:28.680
he's not really an Indian.

32:31.391 --> 32:32.726
Not really an Indian.

32:32.976 --> 32:34.770
These people are my family.

32:34.853 --> 32:37.397
And this mission
is all they have left.

32:38.023 --> 32:41.526
We don't want to be taken care
of by the state or anyone else.

32:41.651 --> 32:45.030
The mission gives us a chance
to take care of ourselves.

32:45.781 --> 32:47.949
I had to stop those papers.

32:48.074 --> 32:50.786
Rudy, I refiled those papers.

32:52.746 --> 32:54.623
Then we might as well quit now.

32:55.332 --> 32:56.750
Once they start to research--

32:56.833 --> 32:59.002
We'll think about that later.
First things first.

32:59.085 --> 33:01.630
Ashton and Taggert
really want this place.

33:01.922 --> 33:05.091
That means there must be
something very special about it.

33:05.759 --> 33:08.512
B.A., you and Murdock
go out to Taggert's.

33:08.637 --> 33:11.306
Give it a real going over. Maybe
you can get us some evidence.

33:11.431 --> 33:14.184
Colonel, I'm not going anywhere.

33:14.392 --> 33:16.228
I'm just an empty shell.

33:16.436 --> 33:19.940
I'm a man without a past
and a questionable...

33:20.440 --> 33:21.817
future, and I...

33:21.942 --> 33:25.195
I just can't believe that
Grandma Murdock lied to me.

33:25.320 --> 33:26.822
Come on now, Pathfinder.

33:26.905 --> 33:28.990
Just because I made up
my story, doesn't mean...

33:29.115 --> 33:31.326
what your Grandma
told you isn't true.

33:31.451 --> 33:35.247
Seems to me I remember stories
about the great frontier scout...

33:35.330 --> 33:37.082
they called Pathfinder.

33:37.499 --> 33:39.000
You keep going, son.

33:39.125 --> 33:41.628
You'll be part of
your own legend soon.

33:41.711 --> 33:44.381
If there was no Pathfinder at the
first battle for the mission...

33:44.464 --> 33:47.050
there certainly will be
for the second.

33:47.175 --> 33:48.802
He's right about that, Captain.

33:51.638 --> 33:53.265
Come on, B.A.

33:53.598 --> 33:55.684
We have legends to begin.

33:56.101 --> 33:58.937
Pathfinder rides again.

34:02.148 --> 34:03.775
I wish you hadn't done that.

34:09.531 --> 34:12.492
You should've figured they'd move
themselves into the mission, Ashton.

34:12.617 --> 34:14.494
Hey, it was your plan,
now we can't get near them.

34:14.619 --> 34:15.996
You're a fool, Ashton.

34:16.079 --> 34:18.790
I'm going to have my men roll
right over the top of them.

34:18.915 --> 34:20.250
- Mission and all.
- Right.

34:20.333 --> 34:22.710
And have half the Federal Government
down on us in 10 minutes.

34:22.793 --> 34:25.630
You heard Smith. This is
a historical landmark, here.

34:32.762 --> 34:34.179
No wonder this
guy knows who we are.

34:34.306 --> 34:35.599
He's a retired colonel.

34:36.266 --> 34:39.643
Man lives pretty good for a
retired Army colonel. Too good.

34:39.728 --> 34:41.771
How convenient. Maps.

34:48.277 --> 34:49.862
Finesse and style.

34:51.031 --> 34:53.742
Army survey map
of Prairie Creek.

34:54.784 --> 34:56.494
<i>Do you really think
the military would waste...</i>

34:56.536 --> 34:58.538
<i>time and money
surveying the property...</i>

34:58.622 --> 35:00.832
if there was a landmark
they couldn't remove?

35:00.957 --> 35:02.250
Maybe they don't know about it.

35:02.334 --> 35:04.669
Look, Ashton, I've made
some calls to Washington.

35:04.753 --> 35:07.213
We'll know the truth about this
so-called historical site...

35:07.297 --> 35:09.549
before the day is over.
And then I'm going to blast--

35:09.841 --> 35:11.217
Oh, damn!

35:30.236 --> 35:32.405
- What did they get?
- Everything.

35:32.656 --> 35:35.283
Survey maps, receipts.

35:35.450 --> 35:36.576
Everything!

35:37.535 --> 35:40.121
The Army wants to
build a new military base!

35:40.413 --> 35:42.248
So, that's what
this is all about.

35:42.415 --> 35:45.460
Taggert used his Pentagon connections
to find out about the land...

35:45.585 --> 35:47.212
then brought in Ashton
as a cover.

35:47.379 --> 35:50.090
Then, Ashton and Taggert sell
the land to the military...

35:50.215 --> 35:52.217
through their dummy corporation
and split the profits...

35:52.300 --> 35:53.802
right down the middle.

35:53.927 --> 35:55.845
They got to be worth
millions of dollars, Hannibal.

35:55.929 --> 35:57.973
And now that Taggert
knows we're onto him...

35:58.098 --> 36:00.558
we'll have to watch him. Pathfinder?
- Yes, sir?

36:00.642 --> 36:03.144
Keep your eye on him. The only
thing that's kept him off us...

36:03.228 --> 36:04.938
is this historical
landmark business.

36:05.063 --> 36:06.731
Once he finds out
it's a phony...

36:06.856 --> 36:08.984
he'll come after us.
We need to know.

36:14.948 --> 36:16.408
Just as I thought.

36:16.825 --> 36:18.201
It's a bluff.

36:19.035 --> 36:20.996
There is no Jonathan Moultrie.

36:21.246 --> 36:23.707
No Battle of Prairie Creek,
nothing!

36:24.499 --> 36:26.584
Well, if Hannibal Smith
wants a war...

36:26.668 --> 36:29.671
I just happen to be in a
position to accommodate him.

37:01.661 --> 37:04.330
What the hell are you doing,
using Army men and supplies?

37:04.456 --> 37:06.666
Are you planning on
giving away the whole scam?

37:06.708 --> 37:08.126
These are my men.

37:08.293 --> 37:10.920
They can be trusted
to keep their mouths shut.

37:11.504 --> 37:14.090
You might be wise
trying doing the same.

37:14.424 --> 37:16.009
All right, let's move out!

37:37.322 --> 37:38.740
They're on their way, Colonel.

37:47.248 --> 37:48.583
Excuse me.

37:50.085 --> 37:52.670
Excuse me. Excuse me.

37:54.297 --> 37:55.381
Thank you.

37:55.715 --> 37:57.592
We got about an hour
to get ready for Taggert.

37:57.759 --> 37:58.843
How?

37:59.010 --> 38:02.388
The only weapons you have are the
guns you got from Fulbright.

38:02.472 --> 38:04.057
That won't stop an army.

38:04.140 --> 38:07.185
There's not a cavalry charging
over the hills in this movie.

38:07.310 --> 38:09.521
You got to have
a little more faith, Rudy.

38:12.565 --> 38:14.609
Pathfinder, Pathfinder.

38:15.068 --> 38:17.237
We're going to need
the cavalry on this one.

40:06.095 --> 40:07.764
How does it look, Colonel?

40:08.264 --> 40:09.807
Looking good, Face.

40:10.308 --> 40:13.228
B.A., how accurate
is your cannon?

40:13.436 --> 40:15.772
You tell me where,
and I'll hit it.

40:15.980 --> 40:17.023
Good.

40:17.273 --> 40:19.192
How long do you
think we can hold out?

40:19.859 --> 40:21.361
Depends on Pathfinder.

40:21.527 --> 40:22.779
It's funny, but...

40:22.946 --> 40:25.281
Jonathan Moultrie held out
for three weeks...

40:25.406 --> 40:26.658
over a 100 years ago.

40:26.741 --> 40:29.577
And here we are, just
like Jonathan Moultrie.

40:29.702 --> 40:31.537
- Yeah.
- In fact...

40:31.913 --> 40:36.000
you are standing on the very spot
where Jonathan C. Moultrie...

40:36.125 --> 40:39.420
took Chief Matsego's arrow
and was mortally wounded.

40:39.545 --> 40:42.298
Yeah, just like Moultrie.

40:45.093 --> 40:47.178
Colonel! Colonel!

40:47.262 --> 40:48.721
Colonel Fulbright.

40:49.180 --> 40:51.474
Colonel Fulbright,
are you in there?

40:52.058 --> 40:54.435
<i>What do you think you idiot!
I'm a General, not a Colonel.</i>

40:54.519 --> 40:55.853
<i>Let me out!</i>

41:03.069 --> 41:05.822
<i>Open this thing up! What do
you think this is anyway?</i>

41:06.030 --> 41:07.615
<i>Smith, you dummy!</i>

41:07.991 --> 41:09.409
<i>Let me out of here!</i>

41:15.581 --> 41:16.791
Who the heck are you anyway?

41:16.874 --> 41:18.960
I am the Pathfinder, sir.

41:19.085 --> 41:22.797
And I bear a message from the
besieged forces at Mission de la Paz.

41:22.922 --> 41:24.299
A Colonel Hannibal Smith...

41:24.424 --> 41:26.384
has asked me to deliver
these documents to you...

41:26.467 --> 41:29.762
and he requests your presence
on the battlefield immediately.

41:29.846 --> 41:31.097
Hannibal Smith sent you.

41:31.180 --> 41:35.476
I cannot stay, sir. My place
is in the heat of battle!

41:37.520 --> 41:38.688
Come on.

41:52.368 --> 41:54.203
We got to get
to that mission now!

41:55.038 --> 41:57.206
Get that van, get it started.
Let's go. Come on.

42:05.923 --> 42:08.634
Smith! Hannibal Smith!

42:09.135 --> 42:10.762
I think we need to talk.

42:10.845 --> 42:12.638
Not much to talk about, Taggert.

42:12.680 --> 42:14.974
You're a money-hungry slimeball.

42:15.141 --> 42:16.934
No more warnings, Smith.

42:17.060 --> 42:19.854
You and your friends
come on down, nice and quiet.

42:19.937 --> 42:22.940
Now! Before
I blow you to bits.

42:23.566 --> 42:24.859
I'll give you 10 seconds.

42:24.984 --> 42:26.569
Good luck, pig breath.

42:26.861 --> 42:28.738
Let her rip, B.A.

43:25.586 --> 43:28.131
Come on, let's go!
They're getting too close!

43:34.971 --> 43:37.682
Sore loser at 10 o'clock, B.A.

43:44.480 --> 43:47.316
Colonel! We can't
hold out much longer.

43:49.527 --> 43:52.071
Keep it up. We've got
to wait for Pathfinder.

44:13.551 --> 44:15.928
Cavalry has arrived, Colonel!

44:25.062 --> 44:27.106
All right, Taggert.
You're under arrest.

44:28.024 --> 44:29.942
You're under arrest for misuse
of Government property.

44:30.026 --> 44:33.070
And if I can swing it,
conspiracy to commit treason.

44:34.989 --> 44:36.073
Captain.

44:36.157 --> 44:38.242
I want all these men
around here put under arrest.

44:38.451 --> 44:41.704
Nobody leaves here, until I
get this thing sorted out.

44:41.913 --> 44:42.955
By the way...

44:43.247 --> 44:45.958
find out if the A-Team is still
hanging around here someplace.

45:01.224 --> 45:03.476
As we dedicate this structure...

45:04.393 --> 45:07.313
recalling that it was
once owned by Sam Houston...

45:07.521 --> 45:09.190
and used as a stable...

45:09.398 --> 45:11.651
before the glorious battle
of the Alamo.

45:11.817 --> 45:13.903
I don't know how we
can ever thank you enough...

45:13.986 --> 45:15.363
for all you've done for us.

45:15.488 --> 45:16.656
It was a pleasure.

45:16.906 --> 45:19.283
Well, you're okay in my book.

45:19.742 --> 45:21.869
But, you better be careful.

45:21.994 --> 45:24.538
The next time you feel like
breaking into a car...

45:24.664 --> 45:27.750
it just might not be
a little old lady...

45:27.833 --> 45:29.502
that sneaks up on you.

45:33.923 --> 45:35.633
Face, I don't know
how you pulled it off.

45:35.758 --> 45:37.677
Where did you find out
about Sam Houston?

45:37.802 --> 45:40.221
Yes, well, you know, Hannibal...

45:40.346 --> 45:42.682
if you talk to the
right people in just the...

45:42.807 --> 45:44.350
right way, you'd be amazed...

45:44.809 --> 45:46.352
at what you can find out.

45:46.519 --> 45:48.688
It is evident that this site...

45:48.813 --> 45:52.066
played a great role
in the shaping of the West.

45:53.150 --> 45:54.902
It is therefore fitting...

45:55.528 --> 45:56.612
and proper...

45:56.737 --> 45:58.656
that we recognize
the achievement...

45:58.823 --> 46:01.826
of those who lived
and died here...

46:03.119 --> 46:05.871
by declaring the
Mission de la Paz...

46:06.038 --> 46:07.665
a national monument...

46:08.040 --> 46:11.419
of the United States of America.

46:14.252 --> 46:16.048
Thank you so much.

46:18.592 --> 46:22.054
Got a pretty sharp fellow here, Hannibal.
Better keep a close eye on him.

46:23.347 --> 46:24.598
Ready to go, Murdock?

46:24.682 --> 46:26.475
I'm right here, Colonel.

46:26.767 --> 46:27.852
I...

46:28.227 --> 46:30.604
I got a surprise for you all.
Guess what it is.

46:31.147 --> 46:32.690
You're staying!
No.

46:32.815 --> 46:33.858
It's Rosie here.

46:33.941 --> 46:35.484
She's a new member
of the A-Team.

46:35.568 --> 46:38.529
I mean, I couldn't really
be the Pathfinder...

46:38.654 --> 46:41.615
without a horse, and In a manner
of speaking, she did save the day.

46:41.699 --> 46:44.493
That's a nice thought,
Murd... Pathfinder...

46:44.577 --> 46:47.330
but I don't think the Chief
would want to let go of Rosie.

46:47.455 --> 46:49.665
They've been together
for quite a long time.

46:49.749 --> 46:51.125
No, no.

46:51.500 --> 46:53.085
We traded even.

46:53.210 --> 46:54.712
- You traded?
- Mmm-hmm.

46:54.837 --> 46:56.005
Traded what?

46:58.841 --> 47:00.176
Hi, Chief.

47:04.472 --> 47:05.681
What's the matter, big guy?

47:05.765 --> 47:07.666
You're the one who said we ought
to give back to the Indians...

47:07.691 --> 47:08.782
everything we took away
from them...

47:08.807 --> 47:11.437
so I thought I'd get the ball rolling...
with your van.
