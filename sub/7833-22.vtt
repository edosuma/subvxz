the Simpson's amazing journey began here...

02:38.858 --> 02:41.588
in the bustling heartland town
of Springfield.

02:41.694 --> 02:44.754
On this unassuming street,
two nobodies...

02:44.864 --> 02:48.163
named Homer and Marge Simpson
settled down to raise a family.

02:48.268 --> 02:51.135
- First came baby Bart.
- [ Babbling ]

Eh!

03:02.782 --> 03:06.218
Nobody told us
how tough it is to raise kids.

03:06.319 --> 03:08.446
They almost drove me
to fortified wine.

03:08.555 --> 03:11.547
Then we figured out we could
park them in front of the TV.

03:11.658 --> 03:15.094
That's how I was raised,
and I turned out TV.

03:15.195 --> 03:18.062
I'd see 'em sitting
on that couch all day long...

03:18.164 --> 03:20.223
just staring at that
Hollywood Hogwash.

03:20.333 --> 03:25.532

hugging and tackling issues.

Homer kept saying he could do
a more realistic family show.

shot a crude five-minute video.

04:28.935 --> 04:32.871
It was amazing how fast Dad betrayed
his vision of a realistic show.

04:32.972 --> 04:35.600
Okay, the material was a little corny.

04:35.708 --> 04:38.609
But Homer and I had
real chemistry on screen.

04:38.711 --> 04:41.145
Every day I thought
about firing Marge.

04:41.247 --> 04:43.147
You know,
just to shake things up.

04:44.984 --> 04:47.885

so Dad volunteered to do the stunt.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.970
Everything was going great at first.

- [ Groaning ]
- [ Narrator] the sequence became

- It's really painful!
- [ Screaming ]

10:50.282 --> 10:54.241

the Simpsons’ star continued to rise,
like a plastic bag caught in an updraft.

[ Lisa Narrating] It was such an honor
to be on the Walk of Fame.

11:07.333 --> 11:12.999
I mean, there we were with Hollywood
royalty like Milton Berle and Nelson Mandela.

11:13.105 --> 11:16.802
And just a few stars down
from the Cheerios honeybee.

11:31.957 --> 11:33.857

Where did the money go?

11:33.959 --> 11:38.089
Marge lost much of the family fortune
investing in birth control products.

[ Narrator]As the Simpsons’ money
dwindled, their expenses soared.

- What kind of song should we play?.

14:58.397 --> 15:01.992
Something that swings
with the beat of New Orleans.

Or was it?
And Homer finds a new passion:

- had been answered- by Satan.
- [ Laughing ]

16:31.223 --> 16:35.557
After the state fair fiasco, none of the family
were speaking to each other.

16:35.661 --> 16:38.289
Fox put the show on hiatus
and replaced it...

16:38.397 --> 16:41.889
with hidden camera footage
from the dressing room at Ann Taylor.

16:42.001 --> 16:45.266
That slugfest at the state fair
was really a blessing.

16:45.371 --> 16:48.067
It gave us a chance
to pursue solo projects.

16:48.173 --> 16:51.301
I returned to my first love-
the legitimate theater.

16:52.711 --> 16:54.611

When Willie asked me to be a presenter
at the New Awareness Awards...

19:19.124 --> 19:22.491

You just don't say no
to the Red Headed Stranger.

19:25.631 --> 19:29.032

that sealed the deal.

[Narrator] Would Willie's
fence-mending eggs bear fruit?

19:31.837 --> 19:36.934
Or would his olive branch
be torn apart by woodpeckers of mistrust?
