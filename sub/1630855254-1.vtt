01:24.334 --> 01:25.419
Annie.

01:29.798 --> 01:31.300
Daddy?

01:31.466 --> 01:32.926
-Dad...
-Go back to sleep.

02:06.877 --> 02:08.377
Let me hold you.

02:17.262 --> 02:18.263
It's okay.

02:19.765 --> 02:20.891
It's just me.

02:21.058 --> 02:22.601
It's your daddy.

02:26.063 --> 02:26.939
It's me!

04:58.632 --> 04:59.633
I...

05:00.926 --> 05:02.928
might've lost my cool a little.

05:04.388 --> 05:06.098
Then I made an ultimatum.

05:07.933 --> 05:08.934
Okay.

05:11.061 --> 05:13.355
I'm just scared that she's
stringing me along.

05:15.440 --> 05:16.817
What are you scared of?

05:18.986 --> 05:20.445
That she doesn't love me.

05:23.699 --> 05:25.993
What are you really scared of?

05:29.329 --> 05:31.415
-Being alone.
-Yeah.

05:31.582 --> 05:33.792
I get it. It can be scary to be alone.

05:35.627 --> 05:36.837
"Where there is fear..."

05:37.004 --> 05:37.963
"There is your task."

05:38.130 --> 05:40.174
"There is your task."

05:41.550 --> 05:42.759
Carl Jung had it figured out.

05:46.430 --> 05:48.348
That's a good place to end for today.

05:48.515 --> 05:50.809
I gotta get my kids to school.

05:50.976 --> 05:51.935
It's been a month.

05:52.102 --> 05:53.854
It's their first day back.
They're a little anxious.

05:54.438 --> 05:57.399
Not that they should be standing
right outside the door.

05:58.609 --> 06:00.110
I feel like such a jerk.

06:00.944 --> 06:03.530
None of my shit compares
to what you're dealing with.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.324
Well, we're not here to talk about me.

06:05.490 --> 06:06.950
After you.

06:07.117 --> 06:08.535
-You got your pencils?
-Yes.

06:08.702 --> 06:09.953
Okay. What about your math book?

06:10.120 --> 06:11.163
Yes.

06:11.330 --> 06:12.372
Wait a minute. Did you brush your teeth?

06:12.539 --> 06:13.665
-Yes. Yes.
-You did?

06:13.832 --> 06:15.542
-Do you wanna use the bathroom, or no?
-No.

06:16.960 --> 06:18.545
Sadie, come on! We're gonna be late!

06:18.712 --> 06:19.671
Sadie...

06:21.089 --> 06:21.924
What?

06:25.594 --> 06:26.595
Nothing.

06:28.805 --> 06:30.015
Looks nice on you.

06:30.182 --> 06:33.519
Just put on a jacket 'cause we're gonna...

06:33.685 --> 06:35.062
It's cold out there.

06:35.229 --> 06:36.730
What if I accidentally swallow it?

06:36.897 --> 06:38.357
Then it'll come out in your shit.

06:38.524 --> 06:39.399
-It's not gonna come out in your shit.
-Back.

06:39.566 --> 06:40.442
-Sadie.
-Forward.

06:40.609 --> 06:41.818
I don't think you should keep pulling it.

06:41.985 --> 06:43.237
-Pull it out.
-No, don't give her that advice.

06:43.403 --> 06:44.613
-What? Yes.
-Don't give her that...

06:44.780 --> 06:45.822
Don't listen to...
No, no, no. Don't...

06:45.989 --> 06:47.157
Should I go soft or hard?

06:47.324 --> 06:48.659
-No, no, no, don't listen...
-Hard.

06:48.825 --> 06:50.786
-Put on your seat belt, please.
-Okay, jeez.

06:50.953 --> 06:52.412
Mom would know what to do.

06:57.543 --> 06:58.752
I could pull it out myself.

06:58.919 --> 06:59.920
-How would you like that?
-What?

07:00.087 --> 07:00.921
-Let me pull it out.
-What?

07:01.088 --> 07:02.381
I'll pull it out right now.
I'm gonna pull it out.

07:11.640 --> 07:12.808
-You okay?
-I'm fine.

07:14.685 --> 07:15.936
Have a great day.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.203
Hey. Hey, Sadie.

07:33.370 --> 07:34.830
I'm sorry about your mom.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.918
Sorry about your mom.

07:42.921 --> 07:43.922
Sorry, Sadie.

07:45.424 --> 07:46.466
You're back.

07:47.467 --> 07:48.427
Sorry, Sadie.

07:48.594 --> 07:51.013
Hey, Sadie. Sorry about your mom.

08:08.989 --> 08:11.158
Hey.

08:12.117 --> 08:13.076
Hey.

08:13.243 --> 08:14.786
What's up?

08:16.663 --> 08:18.540
I still can't believe it, you know?

08:19.499 --> 08:20.667
I know.

08:23.253 --> 08:25.380
But, welcome back.

08:25.547 --> 08:26.590
Oh, my God.

08:27.716 --> 08:30.219
That's really stupid to say.

08:31.678 --> 08:34.972
Thanks for, like, actually talking to me.

08:35.140 --> 08:38.352
Everyone else is staring at me
like I have some kind of disease.

08:38.519 --> 08:39.686
You're sick?

08:39.852 --> 08:40.687
That's so shitty.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.105
No, I...

08:42.272 --> 08:43.941
Just forget it.

08:44.107 --> 08:46.235
You know, I like your dress.

08:46.777 --> 08:47.778
I'd wear it if I could pull it off.

08:47.945 --> 08:49.238
It's like a, it's like a statement.

08:49.404 --> 08:50.447
-Yeah, it's cute.
-Thanks.

08:50.614 --> 08:52.908
-Yeah.
-I mean, it was my mom's.

08:53.075 --> 08:55.285
Are you sure that's a good idea?

08:56.578 --> 08:58.121
Why am I sure what's a good idea?

08:58.288 --> 08:59.665
I just... Wearing her clothes...

08:59.831 --> 09:02.709
it seems like it might make it harder
to move on, or whatever.

09:03.418 --> 09:05.128
I don't wanna "move on."

09:05.838 --> 09:07.047
Okay. Maybe you don't want to...

09:07.214 --> 09:08.340
-creep people out either.
-Nat, come on.

09:09.091 --> 09:09.925
-What? I'm just...
-Let's not...

09:10.092 --> 09:11.218
I'm just trying to help.

09:11.385 --> 09:12.761
No, you're being a bitch.

09:13.387 --> 09:14.221
Wait, hold on.

09:14.388 --> 09:16.139
-I'm sorry. What did you say?
-Nat. Nat...

09:16.306 --> 09:18.934
-No, what did you say?
-I said you're being a bitch.

09:19.101 --> 09:19.935
No, no, no, Natalie! Let's not...

09:22.479 --> 09:24.064
-Oh, my God.
-Natalie, what did you do?

09:25.357 --> 09:26.191
No, stop.

09:32.155 --> 09:34.199
-Do you need something to change into?
-Just leave me alone.

09:39.454 --> 09:40.706
-Oh, my God.
-You can't laugh at that.

09:40.873 --> 09:41.957
-Nat, what the hell?
-What?

09:48.213 --> 09:49.423
That's okay. You're gonna get there.

09:49.590 --> 09:50.632
-Just be patient.
-Okay.

09:50.799 --> 09:52.843
Well, you've been doing the same thing
for 30 years...

09:53.010 --> 09:54.845
we've been working together for what? Two?

09:56.221 --> 09:57.598
Okay. Okay.

09:57.764 --> 09:58.765
Thanks.

09:58.932 --> 09:59.933
You got this.

10:02.644 --> 10:03.979
I'll see you next week.

10:27.044 --> 10:28.504
Dr. Harper?

10:29.004 --> 10:30.214
Can I help you?

10:31.507 --> 10:33.383
I need to talk to you.

10:33.550 --> 10:36.929
I'm sorry, I don't see anyone
without an initial phone consultation.

10:37.095 --> 10:38.847
-So, you'll have to make an appointment.
-Please.

10:41.767 --> 10:45.229
If I don't tell somebody,
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

10:52.528 --> 10:53.612
What's your name?

10:54.363 --> 10:55.989
Lester.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.033
Lester Billings.

10:59.826 --> 11:01.828
Good to meet you, Lester.

11:03.372 --> 11:04.831
Come in. I got a...

11:04.998 --> 11:06.375
I got a free hour.

11:06.875 --> 11:08.377
-Thank you.
-Please.

11:18.971 --> 11:20.222
You wanna hang up your jacket?

11:20.389 --> 11:21.640
Might make you more comfortable.

11:23.225 --> 11:24.726
Can you shut it?

11:26.061 --> 11:27.396
Excuse me?

11:29.314 --> 11:30.732
The door.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.780
Sure.

11:36.947 --> 11:39.992
I have a few forms I need you to fill out.

11:43.662 --> 11:45.664
I use this with all my new clients.

11:45.831 --> 11:48.000
This is for record-keeping purposes only.

11:48.166 --> 11:49.626
So anything you say in here...

11:49.793 --> 11:51.503
is strictly confidential.

11:51.670 --> 11:53.130
Is that okay?

11:57.509 --> 11:59.428
Is this your first time seeing a therapist?

12:01.722 --> 12:04.808
Well, why don't we start with
why you decided to see one now?

12:05.559 --> 12:07.769
I didn't know where else to go, you know, I...

12:09.563 --> 12:11.356
I can't go to a priest
'cause I'm not Catholic.

12:11.523 --> 12:14.651
I can't go to a lawyer
'cause I didn't commit a crime.

12:14.818 --> 12:18.280
Even if everybody thinks I have.

12:18.447 --> 12:21.033
Even if they all think I did it.

12:21.950 --> 12:23.827
Did what, exactly?

12:25.787 --> 12:27.164
Killed my kids.

12:28.749 --> 12:30.042
One at a time.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.127
Killed them all.

12:33.587 --> 12:36.173
I came to you 'cause I thought
that you might understand.

12:36.340 --> 12:38.425
I saw the story about your wife in the paper.

12:38.592 --> 12:39.801
The car accident.

12:41.345 --> 12:42.763
And I know that you know what it's like...

12:42.930 --> 12:46.308
to lose someone that you love just like that.

12:49.311 --> 12:51.146
What were you saying about your children?

12:51.313 --> 12:52.856
What happened to your children?

12:53.023 --> 12:54.733
Well, the first one...

12:54.900 --> 12:57.236
our baby girl, she...

12:57.402 --> 12:58.779
she died from SIDS.

12:58.946 --> 12:59.947
I'm so sorry.

13:00.781 --> 13:03.784
I can't even imagine how difficult
that must have been.

13:07.454 --> 13:08.622
You have kids.

13:10.415 --> 13:12.167
So, you can imagine.

13:17.422 --> 13:21.593
My next two kids died
within a year of the first...

13:21.760 --> 13:23.637
one right after the other.

13:23.804 --> 13:25.013
From natural causes too?

13:25.180 --> 13:27.891
Nothing natural about it.

13:28.058 --> 13:30.310
Sucked the life right out of them.

13:30.853 --> 13:33.480
Even if the first one was an accident...

13:33.981 --> 13:38.151
it still made us susceptible.

13:38.819 --> 13:40.028
Susceptible?

13:41.697 --> 13:43.240
To what?

13:43.407 --> 13:46.285
I don't know exactly.

13:46.451 --> 13:48.161
I only glimpsed it once.

13:50.372 --> 13:53.083
Before my Annie's neck broke.

13:54.668 --> 13:56.753
Before they died, my kids...

13:56.920 --> 14:00.465
I thought it was just their imaginations
getting the better of 'em.

14:00.632 --> 14:04.344
And my oldest did try drawing it for me.

14:24.990 --> 14:26.867
What is this supposed to be?

14:30.204 --> 14:35.083
It's the thing that comes for your kids
when you're not paying attention.

14:43.175 --> 14:44.009
I'm sorry.

14:44.885 --> 14:46.220
Do you mind if I step out?

14:46.386 --> 14:48.180
I just need to use the restroom.

14:53.769 --> 14:56.396
You believe me, don't you?

14:58.482 --> 15:00.234
Of course I do.

15:02.152 --> 15:03.362
I'll be right back.

15:05.239 --> 15:06.281
Excuse me.

15:12.538 --> 15:14.998
Yes, this is Dr. William Harper.

15:15.165 --> 15:18.627
I have a man in my office right now
who is not well.

15:18.794 --> 15:21.004
I think he might be dangerous.

15:21.171 --> 15:23.423
Okay, do you want us to send a car out?

15:25.509 --> 15:26.510
You there?

15:29.555 --> 15:30.806
Sir, you still with me?

15:32.516 --> 15:33.433
Yes.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.227
Can you please confirm your name?

15:35.394 --> 15:37.646
William Harper, yeah.

15:37.813 --> 15:39.189
He came in right off the street.

15:40.649 --> 15:42.359
-You ever see him before?
-No.

15:42.526 --> 15:45.070
-Okay. You don't know who he is?
-No.

15:48.031 --> 15:49.950
No, it's just me. I'm alone in the house.

16:47.424 --> 16:48.550
Dad?

18:38.452 --> 18:39.453
Dad?

19:07.064 --> 19:08.398
-You okay? Are you okay?
-Yeah.

19:08.899 --> 19:11.318
Okay. Okay, listen to me.

19:11.485 --> 19:13.070
Listen, there's a man in the house.

19:20.953 --> 19:22.454
-So gross.
-I know, right?

19:22.621 --> 19:24.831
I think it's gonna come out today.

19:24.998 --> 19:26.208
Guys, guys, look!

19:29.086 --> 19:30.254
Is that Sawyer's house?

19:33.549 --> 19:35.384
I see a dead body.

19:35.968 --> 19:37.845
What's under that white sheet?
There's cops...

19:38.011 --> 19:39.137
Oh, shit!

19:39.304 --> 19:41.098
Your dad's not dead too, is he?

19:42.724 --> 19:46.436
I should've called you guys right away,
the minute he walked in my office.

19:48.230 --> 19:49.648
No, he...

19:51.024 --> 19:52.526
He seemed sick.

19:53.735 --> 19:57.489
He showed me this paper and he had
a drawing that his daughter did.

19:57.656 --> 20:00.784
There was no blood on his hands
or anything like that.

20:00.951 --> 20:02.661
He kept talking about this...

20:05.414 --> 20:07.457
shadow monster.

20:08.792 --> 20:10.878
Shadow monster?

20:12.421 --> 20:14.882
He believed it killed all his kids.

20:16.091 --> 20:18.135
I've seen it before.

20:18.302 --> 20:20.596
Sometimes it's better to have...

20:20.762 --> 20:22.306
something to blame...

20:22.472 --> 20:25.851
than to admit these things happen
for no reason.

20:26.351 --> 20:27.352
Hey.

20:29.730 --> 20:30.564
It's okay.

20:30.731 --> 20:33.609
I don't buy that someone could lose all three
of their kids like that for no reason.

20:33.775 --> 20:34.776
What's going on?

20:34.943 --> 20:36.737
Do you think he killed them?

20:38.864 --> 20:40.282
Guilt must have pushed him over the edge.

20:40.866 --> 20:42.159
Or the fear of getting caught.

20:42.326 --> 20:44.828
Are you sure it was a suicide?

20:45.954 --> 20:47.664
Sweetheart, let me handle...

20:47.831 --> 20:48.665
Sawyer.

20:49.208 --> 20:50.751
Sadie, take Sawyer to her room.

20:50.918 --> 20:51.960
-Please.
-It's okay. It's all right.

20:52.127 --> 20:53.378
It's all right. Let her talk.

20:55.589 --> 20:57.466
What do you mean, "are we sure?"

20:57.633 --> 21:01.720
Before I opened the closet...

21:01.887 --> 21:03.639
I heard these noises.

21:05.599 --> 21:08.727
Like a fight or something.

21:09.311 --> 21:12.481
An adult man hanging himself in a closet
is bound to cause a racket.

21:13.398 --> 21:14.775
That's gotta be what you heard.

21:21.240 --> 21:23.116
Don't worry about that man, okay?

21:23.283 --> 21:25.744
If you get scared, you know where to find me.

21:25.911 --> 21:27.329
-Are you tired?
-No.

21:27.496 --> 21:29.790
Well, it's late and we should go to sleep.

21:29.957 --> 21:30.874
All right?

21:31.959 --> 21:33.168
There you go.

21:33.335 --> 21:35.587
I don't know how you sleep
with all these lights.

21:35.754 --> 21:36.964
Easy. Like this.

21:39.424 --> 21:40.467
Fair enough.

21:41.343 --> 21:42.678
All right, love.

21:42.845 --> 21:44.012
You sleep well.

21:48.600 --> 21:49.852
What's goin' on?

21:52.604 --> 21:55.232
Did you check under the bed?

21:56.233 --> 21:57.276
No, let me look. Let me see.

22:02.781 --> 22:04.408
All clear.

22:05.284 --> 22:06.952
What about the closet?

22:08.829 --> 22:11.039
I don't see anything.

22:11.206 --> 22:13.041
Just can you please check?

22:13.625 --> 22:14.918
Definitely. Definitely.

22:15.085 --> 22:16.587
And you know what? I will bet you...

22:17.713 --> 22:18.964
that there's nothing in there.

22:19.131 --> 22:21.758
I'll give you a dollar
if there's nothing in there.

22:21.925 --> 22:23.427
Five dollars.

22:24.094 --> 22:25.387
Okay.

22:26.388 --> 22:27.222
Five dollars.

22:27.389 --> 22:29.433
You drive a hard bargain.
Got a deal.

22:29.600 --> 22:31.018
Put it there.

22:32.644 --> 22:34.146
No. Dad.

22:34.313 --> 22:37.107
Okay. I'm gonna go.
Let's see.

22:42.654 --> 22:46.074
Well, congratulations.
You're five dollars richer.

22:46.241 --> 22:47.159
Are you sure?

22:47.743 --> 22:48.911
I'm sure.

22:53.373 --> 22:56.168
Okay, monster check complete.

22:56.335 --> 22:58.003
Good night.

22:59.505 --> 23:02.090
See you in the morning light.

23:38.460 --> 23:39.795
Hey, Sadie. Just checking on you.

23:43.590 --> 23:44.424
Hey.

23:44.591 --> 23:45.634
Hi.

23:48.720 --> 23:49.805
You okay?

24:00.190 --> 24:04.236
I don't know why this had to happen
on top of everything else.

24:07.197 --> 24:10.242
Does it remind you of when Mom died?

24:12.619 --> 24:16.373
Did you have to talk to a bunch of police
and stuff?

24:16.540 --> 24:17.666
No.

24:18.709 --> 24:19.877
You never talk about it.

24:20.043 --> 24:21.461
I wasn't at the accident.

24:23.380 --> 24:25.841
So there's no one I had to talk to.

24:30.345 --> 24:31.388
I just...

24:32.848 --> 24:33.724
It doesn't feel real.

24:36.685 --> 24:39.104
I keep thinking she's gonna come
through that door...

24:39.271 --> 24:42.065
with a cardamom tea that smells like shit.

24:46.653 --> 24:48.989
You know, I never even...

24:49.156 --> 24:50.616
got to say goodbye.

24:55.120 --> 24:56.830
Since she died, I feel like...

24:56.997 --> 24:59.166
like this weight.

24:59.333 --> 25:02.085
This extra gravity.

25:02.252 --> 25:03.420
It's just...

25:03.587 --> 25:05.714
You have Dr. Weller tomorrow, right?

25:07.841 --> 25:09.176
Yeah.

25:09.343 --> 25:11.803
You should talk to her about this.

25:13.472 --> 25:16.141
I was trying to talk to you.

25:21.730 --> 25:24.775
Yeah. Yeah.

25:26.068 --> 25:28.320
Well, it's been a long day.

25:28.487 --> 25:31.698
We should probably hit the hay.

25:31.865 --> 25:33.158
I'll see you in the morning.

25:33.325 --> 25:34.326
Sleep happy.

27:42.162 --> 27:43.664
...a particular loved one.

27:43.830 --> 27:47.584
But just focus on that flame
and you can say it out loud yourself.

27:47.751 --> 27:49.920
"Spirit, if you are here today...

27:50.087 --> 27:53.632
"please bend the flame to the left."

27:54.299 --> 28:00.889
Now, just think about the loved one
that you would like to communicate with.

28:01.473 --> 28:03.809
Just imagine them, picture them in your mind.

28:03.976 --> 28:04.935
Think of...

28:05.102 --> 28:06.270
About how you feel about them.

28:06.436 --> 28:08.146
About how they look.

28:08.313 --> 28:11.608
Any strong memories that you have,
you have of them.

28:11.775 --> 28:13.026
Picture their face.

28:13.193 --> 28:14.903
How you feel when you're with them.

28:16.405 --> 28:19.324
Our loved ones are with us always.

28:21.410 --> 28:23.662
If you're there, bend the flame...

28:23.829 --> 28:25.205
-to the left.
-Sadie?

28:27.583 --> 28:28.417
Hey.

28:28.584 --> 28:30.627
You having trouble sleeping?

28:37.467 --> 28:38.302
Sawyer?

28:39.052 --> 28:40.846
There's something in my room.

28:42.389 --> 28:45.184
Sawyer, you were just having a nightmare.

28:50.522 --> 28:52.524
Oh, man.

28:54.193 --> 28:55.152
You're bleeding.

28:55.319 --> 28:56.737
I fell out of bed.

28:58.238 --> 28:59.198
Say "ah."

29:00.908 --> 29:02.242
Yeah, I found the culprit.

29:03.785 --> 29:05.954
Might be time for that little guy
to come out.

29:06.830 --> 29:11.543
This is what Mom did whenever I had a tooth
that wouldn't come out on its own.

29:11.710 --> 29:13.837
She said that deep roots run in our family.

29:14.713 --> 29:15.839
Don't like letting go of things.

29:16.924 --> 29:19.176
So, I'm gonna count to three...

29:19.343 --> 29:20.552
and I'm gonna slam the door.

29:20.719 --> 29:22.763
On three? Or after three?

29:22.930 --> 29:24.973
On three, okay?

29:25.599 --> 29:26.808
Okay.

29:26.975 --> 29:29.353
-One, two...
-Wait!

29:29.520 --> 29:30.437
We don't have to do this...

29:45.869 --> 29:47.204
I'm so sorry!

29:47.371 --> 29:48.580
You said on three!

29:48.747 --> 29:49.665
I don't know what happened.

29:49.831 --> 29:51.542
Hey, hey, hey.

30:04.263 --> 30:07.307
Too-Ra-Loo-Ra-Loo-Ra

30:07.474 --> 30:09.935
Too-Ra-Loo-Ra-Li

30:10.936 --> 30:15.190
Too-Ra-Loo-Ra-Loo-Ra

30:15.357 --> 30:18.485
Hush now, don't you cry

30:19.570 --> 30:22.865
Too-Ra-Loo-Ra-Loo-Ra

30:43.093 --> 30:48.891
Too-Ra-Loo-Ra

30:51.393 --> 30:53.562
Too-Ra

30:53.729 --> 30:57.274
Loo-Ra-Ra

30:57.441 --> 31:01.361
Too-Ra-Loo-Ra

31:01.528 --> 31:08.202
Hush now, don't you cry

31:08.368 --> 31:14.208
Loo-Ra-Loo-Ra-Loo-Ra

31:22.466 --> 31:27.846
Hush now, don't you cry

31:28.972 --> 31:33.644
What do you think happens
to people after they die?

31:34.311 --> 31:35.896
Now, what do you mean, Sadie?

31:36.522 --> 31:38.273
Do you mean do they go to Heaven?

31:38.440 --> 31:40.984
No, that's not what I mean.

31:41.568 --> 31:43.987
Are you wondering if maybe your mother
is still here?

31:48.617 --> 31:52.204
This may seem a little out there, but...

31:52.371 --> 31:54.081
when my father passed away...

31:54.248 --> 31:56.875
I felt like I could sense him...

31:57.292 --> 31:59.753
watching over me sometimes.

32:00.295 --> 32:02.297
If you pay close enough attention...

32:02.464 --> 32:05.342
maybe you'll start sensing your mom, too.

32:05.509 --> 32:07.928
What about other things?

32:08.095 --> 32:09.596
What other things?

32:09.763 --> 32:10.597
I don't know.

32:10.764 --> 32:11.807
It's hard to see. It's like...

32:14.434 --> 32:16.353
a dark thing.

32:16.520 --> 32:17.437
I see.

32:17.604 --> 32:20.357
Well, when did you start seeing
this dark thing?

32:21.191 --> 32:22.776
Right after that man died.

32:24.403 --> 32:26.280
That makes perfect sense.

32:26.989 --> 32:28.282
Okay.

32:28.448 --> 32:29.324
So, what is it?

32:29.491 --> 32:31.910
Well, when there are scary things
we don't understand...

32:32.077 --> 32:35.163
our minds try to fill in the blanks.

32:35.330 --> 32:39.501
But it's just like all those spooky monsters
you think are hiding under your bed.

32:39.668 --> 32:41.920
But we're going to work on that together.

32:42.087 --> 32:43.589
Okay?

32:43.755 --> 32:45.716
So, it's not so scary.

32:51.555 --> 32:54.558
Now, we talked about this last time.

32:54.725 --> 32:56.101
When we have a phobia...

32:56.852 --> 32:58.061
or fear something...

32:58.729 --> 33:00.480
sometimes the best thing to do...

33:00.647 --> 33:02.107
is to face it.

33:02.274 --> 33:04.109
And that's what we're gonna do today.

33:04.276 --> 33:08.822
So, this light is gonna be completely solid
like it is right now.

33:08.989 --> 33:11.200
Then gradually it's gonna start flashing...

33:11.825 --> 33:14.995
slowly bringing the room down
till it's totally dark.

33:15.412 --> 33:17.915
So you can see that there's nothing
to be afraid of.

33:18.081 --> 33:19.082
Okay?

33:23.086 --> 33:24.213
I'm ready.

33:24.671 --> 33:26.173
Okay, good girl. Let's start.

33:27.966 --> 33:30.302
That's not so scary, is it?

33:31.803 --> 33:34.640
See? Same old boring office as before.

33:38.685 --> 33:40.354
Just you, your sister...

33:40.521 --> 33:41.563
and me.

33:43.357 --> 33:44.233
You doin' okay?

33:44.983 --> 33:45.859
No.

33:52.950 --> 33:54.910
Hey, hey, hey.

33:55.077 --> 33:55.994
It's all right. It's all right.

33:56.161 --> 33:58.080
-You're so close.
-I don't want to.

33:58.247 --> 33:59.998
No. Sawyer, you got this.

34:00.165 --> 34:01.333
It's not real. It's not real.

34:01.500 --> 34:03.502
Hey, you're doing so good.

34:05.003 --> 34:07.005
It's not real.

34:07.798 --> 34:08.966
Good job.

34:09.132 --> 34:10.801
It's not real. It's all in your head.

34:10.967 --> 34:12.928
Remember, nothing to be scared of.

34:17.516 --> 34:18.433
It's all in your head.

34:19.434 --> 34:21.186
It's not real. You got this.

34:22.187 --> 34:24.063
It's almost over.

34:24.231 --> 34:25.232
It's not real.

34:39.413 --> 34:41.039
Hey!

34:41.206 --> 34:44.333
It was only your imagination.

34:44.501 --> 34:45.335
You did it.

34:50.215 --> 34:51.425
Sawyer, it's okay.

34:51.592 --> 34:54.219
-It's fine.
-No need to worry.

34:54.386 --> 34:55.679
-It's okay.
-Yeah.

34:55.846 --> 34:57.097
Now you don't have to do that again.

34:58.974 --> 35:00.017
It's not just a fear of the dark.

35:00.184 --> 35:02.019
She's claiming to see monsters now.

35:02.186 --> 35:04.438
Yep. Yeah, I heard about the monster.

35:04.605 --> 35:06.106
We talked about the monster.

35:06.273 --> 35:07.900
They want to speak with you now.

35:08.066 --> 35:10.903
I think next session
would be the proper time.

35:11.069 --> 35:12.571
Yeah, I know.

35:12.738 --> 35:16.116
It doesn't seem like the right time for me,
but eventually I'll come in.

35:16.283 --> 35:17.659
We have to talk about your wife.

35:17.826 --> 35:19.036
You believe me...

35:19.620 --> 35:20.621
don't you?

35:22.289 --> 35:23.874
Yeah.

35:24.041 --> 35:25.751
I got this under control.
Thank you very much.

35:25.918 --> 35:27.920
Will, you can't avoid talking
about her forever.

35:28.086 --> 35:29.463
Guys ready? Let's go.

35:43.769 --> 35:45.395
I'm really sorry.

35:50.317 --> 35:52.903
I should have never let that man
in our house.

36:43.704 --> 36:45.163
You doin' okay?

36:45.330 --> 36:46.415
Not really.

36:46.915 --> 36:48.542
Try to go to sleep.

36:49.293 --> 36:53.172
Just trying not to die, thanks.

36:53.338 --> 36:55.382
It's all just in your head.

36:55.549 --> 36:57.718
It's not real.

37:05.517 --> 37:06.685
Sadie?

37:52.481 --> 37:56.401
I do this with all my new clients,
but it's for record-keeping purposes only.

37:58.862 --> 37:59.863
Sadie?

38:05.327 --> 38:06.328
Sadie?

38:12.417 --> 38:13.877
It's not real.

38:18.549 --> 38:22.678
My next two kids died
within a year of the first...

38:22.845 --> 38:25.180
one right after the other.

38:25.347 --> 38:28.559
Even if the first one was an accident...

38:28.725 --> 38:32.187
it still made us susceptible.

38:35.315 --> 38:36.149
Susceptible?

38:37.025 --> 38:38.110
To what?

38:38.277 --> 38:40.445
I only glimpsed it once.

38:40.612 --> 38:42.197
Before my Annie's neck broke.

38:44.283 --> 38:46.243
Before they died, my kids...

38:46.410 --> 38:49.621
I thought it was just their imaginations
getting the better of 'em and...

38:52.291 --> 38:55.544
So, my oldest, she tried drawing it for me.

39:03.051 --> 39:06.430
Too-Ra-Loo-Ra-Loo-Ra

39:06.597 --> 39:09.892
Too-Ra-Loo-Ra-Li

39:10.058 --> 39:13.228
Too-Ra-Loo-Ra-Loo

39:13.395 --> 39:18.192
Hush now, don't you cry

39:21.862 --> 39:23.488
I know that's you, Sadie.

39:23.655 --> 39:24.656
Sawyer.

39:35.042 --> 39:36.210
What is this supposed to be?

39:38.295 --> 39:41.798
It's the thing that comes for your kids
when you're not paying attention.

40:09.076 --> 40:11.620
You believe me, don't you?

40:11.787 --> 40:13.163
Of course I do.

40:15.374 --> 40:16.917
No!

40:20.003 --> 40:21.463
No, no.

40:21.630 --> 40:23.215
No. No!

40:23.382 --> 40:24.341
I'm sorry, Annie.

40:24.508 --> 40:26.969
I'm sorry, Scott. I never believed you.

40:27.135 --> 40:28.303
I never believed you.

40:28.470 --> 40:31.139
I'm so sorry, Sophie.

40:31.306 --> 40:33.016
I'm so sorry.

40:38.230 --> 40:40.065
Get away from me. You get away...

40:40.232 --> 40:41.483
Get away from me!

40:42.860 --> 40:44.945
Shit!

41:35.412 --> 41:37.206
-Hey! What was that for?
-That was a mean prank!

41:37.372 --> 41:38.790
How are you doing that with your voice?

41:38.957 --> 41:39.791
What are you talking about?

41:41.668 --> 41:42.836
-Sawyer, it wasn't me!
-Liar!

41:43.378 --> 41:44.379
-Sawyer!
-Liar!

41:59.186 --> 42:02.481
Is this the dark thing
that you've been seeing?

42:05.359 --> 42:06.527
Yeah.

42:07.236 --> 42:09.655
Is it real?

42:09.821 --> 42:11.073
I don't know.

42:13.534 --> 42:15.452
But I'm gonna find out.

42:16.161 --> 42:17.246
It was just...

42:17.412 --> 42:20.415
Yeah, it wasn't really a big deal,
I don't think...

42:20.582 --> 42:22.376
-but it was fine.
-I have nothin' to wear.

42:22.918 --> 42:24.711
But it's, you know, at the same time
I think about it, it's like...

42:24.878 --> 42:25.921
Drama alert.

42:27.673 --> 42:29.716
Guys, be nice. She just lost her mom.

42:29.883 --> 42:32.344
I haven't seen my dad in like a year,
and I seriously don't give a...

42:32.511 --> 42:34.179
Can I talk to you?

42:34.930 --> 42:35.764
Yeah. Of course.

42:36.431 --> 42:37.349
Alone.

42:40.686 --> 42:41.854
Okay.

42:43.939 --> 42:45.065
What is her deal?

42:47.901 --> 42:48.777
Have fun.

42:48.944 --> 42:49.945
Which class y'all got next?

42:53.615 --> 42:55.367
I'm sorry about the other day. It was...

42:56.743 --> 42:58.662
-Do you wanna make it up to me?
-Of course.

42:59.329 --> 43:01.373
Yeah, anything.

43:01.540 --> 43:02.875
Can you give me a ride?

43:22.102 --> 43:23.854
You sure this is the right place?

43:27.065 --> 43:27.983
Just wait here.

43:28.150 --> 43:29.610
You're not seriously going in?

43:29.776 --> 43:30.819
Sadie?

43:30.986 --> 43:32.988
Sadie!

43:43.498 --> 43:44.499
Hello?

44:12.486 --> 44:13.487
Hello?

44:14.738 --> 44:16.865
Is anybody home?

44:26.959 --> 44:27.793
What?

44:27.960 --> 44:29.670
Are you, like, buying drugs or something?

44:29.837 --> 44:30.671
No. What...

44:30.838 --> 44:31.922
I'm not buying drugs.

44:32.089 --> 44:35.008
I know things have been hard for you lately,
but I...

44:35.175 --> 44:36.927
Just wanna see if anyone still lived here.

44:37.636 --> 44:38.762
I really hope not.

44:38.929 --> 44:41.306
That'd be, like, the saddest thing ever.

44:43.100 --> 44:43.976
What is this place?

44:46.019 --> 44:47.688
Sadie, what was that?

44:47.855 --> 44:48.939
Wait a second.

45:02.703 --> 45:03.745
Coming back now.

45:07.165 --> 45:08.959
Sadie, what's going on?

45:09.126 --> 45:10.127
Is there someone there?

45:21.930 --> 45:22.931
Hello?

46:27.329 --> 46:29.081
Hello?

46:38.423 --> 46:39.591
Is anybody here?

47:43.322 --> 47:45.365
This some kind of a dare?

47:48.911 --> 47:52.331
You think it'd be fun to get off
on our misery?

47:52.915 --> 47:54.541
Maybe get a souvenir.

47:54.708 --> 47:55.667
No.

47:58.086 --> 48:00.005
I'm Sadie.

48:00.172 --> 48:01.298
Sadie Harper.

48:03.091 --> 48:05.719
Your husband, Lester, came to see my dad.

48:10.682 --> 48:11.517
I just...

48:12.184 --> 48:14.728
I wanted to ask about...

48:14.895 --> 48:17.564
-What?
-This right here.

48:21.151 --> 48:22.319
Where'd you get this?

48:23.362 --> 48:25.989
I just wanna know what it is.

48:29.451 --> 48:32.037
You should pray to God you never find out.

48:32.538 --> 48:34.665
Get outta here before you get yourself hurt.

48:37.084 --> 48:38.293
My sister saw it.

48:44.842 --> 48:48.178
Oh, Les, what have you done?

48:49.054 --> 48:50.973
Must've latched on to you now.

48:52.641 --> 48:56.311
Goes after the hurt and the vulnerable.

48:58.230 --> 49:00.399
Follows you wherever you go.

49:03.110 --> 49:04.695
Until you're all gone.

49:07.155 --> 49:09.783
That's what happened to your kids?

49:14.204 --> 49:15.038
They called it...

49:16.498 --> 49:18.709
"The Boogeyman."

49:20.711 --> 49:22.713
Yeah, that's the way I used to look at them.

49:24.214 --> 49:26.091
Like they were crazy.

49:27.009 --> 49:28.969
I found out the hard way I was wrong.

49:30.679 --> 49:32.264
It likes to play with its food.

49:33.015 --> 49:34.600
Scare 'em to death.

49:34.766 --> 49:37.394
Shit, it can even talk like them.

49:40.606 --> 49:42.649
Like a goddamn echo.

49:50.240 --> 49:52.659
And it needs the dark to stay hidden.

49:59.416 --> 50:04.338
Fire was the first thing man used
to see at night.

50:06.590 --> 50:08.383
It's really been around that long?

50:13.138 --> 50:15.224
I think it's been around forever.

50:23.273 --> 50:24.900
Don't move.

50:27.402 --> 50:30.614
It's right behind you.

50:32.658 --> 50:33.951
Don't turn around.

50:36.912 --> 50:38.914
Stay in the light.

50:40.165 --> 50:43.001
And stay completely...

50:45.379 --> 50:46.505
still.

50:47.756 --> 50:49.299
I see you, you son of a bitch!

50:51.385 --> 50:53.637
Sadie!
Hey, was that a gunshot?

50:54.763 --> 50:56.473
-Sadie! Sadie! Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

50:56.640 --> 50:58.100
It's just some crazy bitch.

50:58.267 --> 50:59.101
Sadie...

50:59.268 --> 51:00.811
Let's get outta here.

51:14.199 --> 51:15.576
Sadie?

51:15.742 --> 51:17.578
What happened to you?

51:18.328 --> 51:20.622
-Sawyer, I can't right now.
-Sadie?

51:21.665 --> 51:22.833
Wait, what happened?

51:23.000 --> 51:24.168
Leave me alone, Sawyer.

51:24.334 --> 51:25.377
Sadie, did you see it?

51:25.544 --> 51:27.671
There's no such thing as monsters.

51:27.838 --> 51:29.006
You need to grow up!

51:29.173 --> 51:30.924
Sadie!

51:31.091 --> 51:32.301
I'm serious, Sawyer.

51:32.467 --> 51:33.677
I need to be alone right...

52:36.406 --> 52:38.116
I told you it was real.

53:36.300 --> 53:37.551
What are you doing?

53:39.720 --> 53:41.221
Where is everything?

53:43.724 --> 53:46.685
It's not a good idea for us to keep
her stuff lying around.

53:50.147 --> 53:51.273
No wonder Sawyer's seeing ghosts.

53:56.236 --> 53:57.821
How could you do this without even asking?

53:57.988 --> 53:59.698
-Sometimes I have to make decisions...
-You're just gonna get rid of all her stuff?

53:59.865 --> 54:01.241
-...that you might not understand.
-How I feel doesn't count?

54:01.408 --> 54:02.242
That's not what I said.

54:02.409 --> 54:03.452
-Don't put words in my mouth.
-That's how you act!

54:03.619 --> 54:05.245
You barely pay attention to anything I say!

54:05.412 --> 54:06.747
It's like you don't even give a shit...

54:06.914 --> 54:08.582
-about Mom anymore.
-You don't know how I feel!

54:08.749 --> 54:09.875
So tell me!

54:15.714 --> 54:18.467
You're right. I'm sorry.

54:18.634 --> 54:21.053
I shouldn't have done that
without asking you.

54:21.220 --> 54:22.429
Keep what you want.

54:22.596 --> 54:24.181
What if I wanna keep all of it?

54:24.348 --> 54:25.891
Then we'll keep all of it.

54:26.892 --> 54:28.936
Just take it down to the basement for me.

56:21.381 --> 56:25.219
Ral-Too-Ra-Loo-Ra-Li

56:25.385 --> 56:28.138
Too-Ra-Loo-Ra-Loo-Ral

56:28.305 --> 56:31.934
Hush now, don't you cry

56:32.100 --> 56:35.437
Just a simple little ditty

56:35.604 --> 56:38.774
In her good old Irish way

56:38.941 --> 56:42.694
And I'd give the world if I could hear

56:42.861 --> 56:46.532
That song of hers today

56:46.698 --> 56:48.742
That's beautiful. Keep going.

56:48.909 --> 56:49.952
Liar.

56:50.118 --> 56:51.328
She loves it.

56:51.495 --> 56:52.663
You're such a liar.

56:54.540 --> 56:56.917
I have a terrible voice.

57:19.940 --> 57:21.316
Mom...

57:22.943 --> 57:24.862
if you're here...

57:25.028 --> 57:26.989
bend the flame to the left.

57:31.785 --> 57:33.036
Please.

57:34.913 --> 57:37.374
I could really use your help right now.

57:40.002 --> 57:42.880
I have a terrible voice.

58:48.946 --> 58:51.573
Ra-Loo-Ra-Loo-Ral

58:51.740 --> 58:55.118
Too-Ra-Loo-Ra-Li

58:55.285 --> 58:58.247
Too-Ra-Loo-Ra-Loo-Ral

58:58.413 --> 58:59.248
Sadie.

59:00.290 --> 59:01.124
Who is that?

59:01.291 --> 59:02.501
Hi.

59:02.668 --> 59:03.669
Is that Daddy?

59:03.836 --> 59:04.837
Hi.

59:06.296 --> 59:07.339
Boop.

59:09.132 --> 59:10.259
Boop.

59:10.843 --> 59:12.219
Wait. Do you mind?

59:12.386 --> 59:13.887
Well, it's not like you're peeing.

59:14.054 --> 59:17.766
Not that I haven't seen you pee
a thousand times before.

59:19.518 --> 59:21.019
What's going on with you?

59:21.645 --> 59:24.273
-Nothing.
-Come on, it's not nothing.

59:24.439 --> 59:27.234
The house I took you to, the gunshot.

59:28.360 --> 59:30.320
It's too hard to explain.

59:30.779 --> 59:32.531
I'm probably just losing my mind.

59:34.741 --> 59:35.576
What are you doing?

59:35.742 --> 59:38.453
I'm not leaving until you tell me
what's going on.

59:38.912 --> 59:40.664
Come on, I'm your best friend.

59:42.249 --> 59:45.169
You were my best friend.

59:45.335 --> 59:48.297
Now you have all these new friends
who are so much cooler.

59:48.463 --> 59:49.882
That is not true.

59:50.048 --> 59:51.341
They're your friends, too.

59:52.968 --> 59:55.095
When was the last time that we hung out?

59:57.973 --> 59:59.683
Your mom's funeral.

01:00:01.310 --> 01:00:03.520
That doesn't count.

01:00:04.479 --> 01:00:06.023
Well, let's hang out.

01:00:07.274 --> 01:00:09.067
This weekend even, we can all come over.

01:00:11.361 --> 01:00:12.279
I don't need a pity party.

01:00:12.446 --> 01:00:13.322
It's not a pity party.

01:00:13.488 --> 01:00:14.531
That's not what this is.

01:00:17.993 --> 01:00:19.203
It won't be.

01:00:19.369 --> 01:00:21.121
Look, I have no idea
what you're dealing with...

01:00:21.288 --> 01:00:25.250
but you shouldn't be dealing
with this alone, all right?

01:00:26.543 --> 01:00:27.377
Come on.

01:00:28.378 --> 01:00:29.213
Come on.

01:00:38.096 --> 01:00:39.306
Yes!

01:00:42.100 --> 01:00:44.811
So, this is a big night
for your sister, okay?

01:00:44.978 --> 01:00:47.314
So, you see any monsters,
you come get me first.

01:00:47.481 --> 01:00:48.565
Let's give her the night off.

01:00:49.525 --> 01:00:50.817
That sound okay?

01:00:53.529 --> 01:00:55.531
And you'll let me sleep in your bed?

01:00:55.697 --> 01:00:58.492
Yeah, I'll let you sleep in my bed
if you stop eating the cheese...

01:00:58.659 --> 01:01:00.035
'cause you're gonna be farting all night.

01:01:01.495 --> 01:01:03.205
Let's make a deal. Okay?

01:01:03.372 --> 01:01:06.542
I will let you play PlayStation
for as long as you want.

01:01:06.708 --> 01:01:08.293
Screen time is officially suspended.

01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:10.712
Just let her have a nice night.

01:01:10.879 --> 01:01:11.713
Deal?

01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:12.714
Deal.

01:01:12.881 --> 01:01:14.758
-Deal. Give me the cheese.
-Wait, wait.

01:01:14.925 --> 01:01:16.051
What are you guys betting on?

01:01:16.218 --> 01:01:17.135
We're not betting.

01:01:17.302 --> 01:01:19.847
We're agreeing to stay
out of the way tonight. Right?

01:01:21.932 --> 01:01:24.351
Oh, shit. That's them.

01:01:25.352 --> 01:01:26.478
I look okay?

01:01:26.937 --> 01:01:28.313
You look...

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:30.190
beautiful.

01:01:30.357 --> 01:01:34.528
You look like you're about to forget
all your worries and your strife.

01:01:36.613 --> 01:01:37.823
Jungle Book.

01:01:37.990 --> 01:01:39.992
Remember? You used to love that.
We used to dance.

01:01:40.158 --> 01:01:41.952
Bare necessities

01:01:42.119 --> 01:01:44.121
Just don't say anything, okay?

01:01:51.962 --> 01:01:54.089
Hey! Hi!

01:02:05.225 --> 01:02:07.352
Do you have anything else to drink?

01:02:09.021 --> 01:02:10.439
Like other kinds of soda?

01:02:10.606 --> 01:02:12.024
No, like alcohol.

01:02:12.983 --> 01:02:16.236
Sorry, my dad's not much of a drinker, so...

01:02:16.403 --> 01:02:17.738
That you know of.

01:02:19.114 --> 01:02:19.948
Nat.

01:02:22.743 --> 01:02:25.120
Well, I do have something else, though.

01:02:28.415 --> 01:02:30.626
Like, actual drugs.

01:02:31.001 --> 01:02:31.960
Wait, what?

01:02:32.503 --> 01:02:33.337
Okay.

01:02:35.964 --> 01:02:36.924
Cool.

01:02:38.383 --> 01:02:39.885
Actual drugs.

01:02:42.888 --> 01:02:44.097
Since when do you smoke?

01:02:44.264 --> 01:02:45.557
It was my mom's.

01:02:46.433 --> 01:02:47.768
Oh, shit.

01:02:48.644 --> 01:02:49.770
But it's cool.

01:02:49.937 --> 01:02:52.731
I mean, it's not like she's coming back
to get it.

01:02:53.482 --> 01:02:54.399
You sure?

01:02:55.734 --> 01:02:56.568
Yeah.

01:03:03.534 --> 01:03:04.743
All right, this is probably out
of lighter fluid.

01:03:04.910 --> 01:03:06.161
Okay, let me just...

01:03:10.582 --> 01:03:12.376
Amateurs.

01:03:13.210 --> 01:03:14.169
There.

01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:18.882
Now you.

01:03:19.049 --> 01:03:20.384
In honor of your mom.

01:03:20.551 --> 01:03:21.468
Thanks.

01:03:35.482 --> 01:03:38.485
Definitely popping your cherry
right now, huh?

01:03:40.529 --> 01:03:41.655
This is so sweet.

01:03:42.823 --> 01:03:44.283
You all right?

01:03:44.449 --> 01:03:45.993
You need water or something?

01:03:46.159 --> 01:03:47.119
It's all right.

01:03:48.745 --> 01:03:50.247
-You okay?
-Oh, my God. Yeah.

01:03:50.414 --> 01:03:51.623
I think you need to go to...

01:03:52.916 --> 01:03:54.084
Are you sure you're good?

01:03:54.668 --> 01:03:56.461
-Do you need some water?
-Take a deep breath.

01:04:27.367 --> 01:04:28.410
Oh, God. It made you sick?

01:04:29.077 --> 01:04:30.287
-You feel all right?
-I'm fine.

01:04:30.454 --> 01:04:31.747
-Are you sure?
-I'm fine.

01:04:31.914 --> 01:04:32.748
So cute.

01:04:32.915 --> 01:04:34.416
Oh, my God, guys!

01:04:34.791 --> 01:04:35.667
Say cheese!

01:04:36.251 --> 01:04:37.878
Guys, come on. Don't.

01:04:38.045 --> 01:04:39.129
What are you doing?

01:04:39.296 --> 01:04:40.631
I wasn't even recording.

01:04:40.797 --> 01:04:41.882
Are you sure you're okay?

01:04:42.049 --> 01:04:43.133
I'm fine.

01:04:43.550 --> 01:04:44.593
I should make myself throw up.

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:45.636
I ate so much pizza.

01:04:45.802 --> 01:04:47.304
No, it was the weed. It made her sick.

01:04:47.471 --> 01:04:51.433
Hey, isn't this the closet
where that crazy guy hung himself?

01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:54.436
No, that was the closet in my mom's studio.

01:04:54.603 --> 01:04:55.979
Could you show it to us?

01:04:59.149 --> 01:05:00.567
Shit, that'd be sick.

01:05:00.734 --> 01:05:01.693
Right?

01:05:08.992 --> 01:05:10.536
Where was he hanging from?

01:05:12.538 --> 01:05:14.289
He was right around the back of...

01:05:26.510 --> 01:05:27.886
-What are you doing? What are you...
-Nat, come on. Oh, my God.

01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:30.138
It's called exposure therapy.

01:05:30.305 --> 01:05:31.723
-Don't!
-Guys!

01:05:31.890 --> 01:05:33.392
-Come on!
-Oh, God.

01:05:33.559 --> 01:05:34.560
This isn't funny!

01:05:34.726 --> 01:05:36.603
It's not a big deal. Just chill.

01:05:47.990 --> 01:05:51.201
I have a terrible voice.

01:05:56.623 --> 01:05:57.791
Please!

01:05:57.958 --> 01:05:58.917
Please!

01:06:02.212 --> 01:06:03.797
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

01:06:05.382 --> 01:06:07.050
-Hey, hey, hey, Sadie.
-What happened? What happened?

01:06:07.217 --> 01:06:08.427
Are you okay? Was there something in there?

01:06:09.678 --> 01:06:10.804
Was there something in there?

01:06:10.971 --> 01:06:13.182
No, she's just being dramatic.

01:06:15.601 --> 01:06:17.394
-Oh, my God! God, Sadie...
-What is wrong with you?

01:06:17.561 --> 01:06:18.604
-...the door would not open!
-You psycho bitch!

01:06:18.770 --> 01:06:19.855
I swear, we were all trying.

01:06:20.022 --> 01:06:21.773
You are such a liar!

01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:23.525
-Keep your hands to your...
-And you're a freak!

01:06:23.692 --> 01:06:27.487
Bethany is literally the only person in here
who actually likes you.

01:06:28.113 --> 01:06:30.115
-Literally schizophrenic!
-Oh, my God.

01:06:30.282 --> 01:06:31.366
-She's crazy!
-Are you okay?

01:06:31.533 --> 01:06:32.409
-What's going on, guys?
-No!

01:06:32.576 --> 01:06:33.994
Your daughter is psychotic.

01:06:41.251 --> 01:06:42.836
I'm so done with her.

01:06:43.003 --> 01:06:45.047
You are never gonna hang out with her again.

01:06:45.214 --> 01:06:46.673
She's literally never done anything like...

01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:49.551
-I can't believe she slapped me!
-Dude, are you okay?

01:06:49.718 --> 01:06:51.261
I mean, she's never done anything...

01:07:49.903 --> 01:07:50.946
Sawyer.

01:07:54.199 --> 01:07:56.618
Sawyer.

01:08:04.334 --> 01:08:05.502
Sawyer.

01:09:29.044 --> 01:09:30.796
Sawyer. Hey, hey!

01:09:32.714 --> 01:09:34.925
Sawyer! Sawyer!

01:09:35.091 --> 01:09:37.803
Come on, come on!
Sawyer!

01:09:38.970 --> 01:09:39.805
Go!

01:09:39.971 --> 01:09:41.305
Hey, hey.

01:09:41.473 --> 01:09:42.390
Get 911!

01:09:42.515 --> 01:09:43.350
Sawyer!

01:09:46.435 --> 01:09:48.772
It's okay.
It's okay.

01:09:48.939 --> 01:09:49.814
It tried to kill me.

01:09:49.982 --> 01:09:52.401
-I know. I saw it too.
-I had to get away.

01:09:54.945 --> 01:09:56.655
I believe you.

01:09:57.781 --> 01:09:58.615
What?

01:09:59.283 --> 01:10:00.409
I believe you.

01:10:00.576 --> 01:10:03.203
I'm sorry I didn't before.

01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:09.710
Where's Dad?

01:10:09.877 --> 01:10:13.589
He went to go talk to a doctor,
but I'm gonna find him.

01:10:13.755 --> 01:10:14.590
We're gonna go home.

01:10:14.756 --> 01:10:15.924
No, no, no. Don't go.

01:10:16.091 --> 01:10:17.009
-No.
-Please, don't go.

01:10:17.176 --> 01:10:19.136
I'm gonna be right back, okay?

01:10:33.775 --> 01:10:34.943
Hello?

01:10:35.110 --> 01:10:37.988
Hey, it's Rita Billings.

01:10:38.155 --> 01:10:39.281
Lester's wife.

01:10:39.448 --> 01:10:40.949
What do you want?

01:10:41.116 --> 01:10:43.243
I found a way to get rid of it.

01:10:43.410 --> 01:10:44.369
How?

01:10:44.536 --> 01:10:46.788
I need your help.
Get over here.

01:10:47.831 --> 01:10:50.292
We can end this tonight.

01:10:52.503 --> 01:10:53.337
Sadie?

01:10:54.296 --> 01:10:55.255
Sadie...

01:11:00.761 --> 01:11:01.678
Dad?

01:11:02.513 --> 01:11:03.722
Hey.

01:11:03.889 --> 01:11:05.224
What are you doing?

01:11:05.933 --> 01:11:06.850
Nothing.

01:11:07.017 --> 01:11:08.852
Go back to your sister.

01:11:09.019 --> 01:11:10.187
I'll be right there.

01:11:11.271 --> 01:11:13.106
Well, I can tell it's not nothing.

01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:23.116
They brought Mom here after the car accident.

01:11:23.825 --> 01:11:24.993
And now Sawyer.

01:11:26.453 --> 01:11:27.871
This is all my fault.

01:11:31.208 --> 01:11:33.168
I didn't do enough to help her process it...

01:11:33.335 --> 01:11:34.378
so now she's having...

01:11:34.545 --> 01:11:35.838
these manifestations.

01:11:36.004 --> 01:11:38.173
Oh, Dad, stop.
They're not manifestations.

01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:39.508
Then what is it?

01:11:42.386 --> 01:11:43.595
What is it?

01:11:47.015 --> 01:11:48.600
It's real.

01:11:50.185 --> 01:11:52.229
I saw something tonight.

01:11:53.772 --> 01:11:55.899
In the closet.

01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:57.359
What does it look like?

01:11:57.526 --> 01:11:59.611
-I mean, was it...
-It was really dark in there.

01:12:01.029 --> 01:12:02.114
Couldn't tell.

01:12:07.369 --> 01:12:09.705
I'm gonna ask you a question, okay?

01:12:09.872 --> 01:12:10.914
I don't want you to get mad.

01:12:11.081 --> 01:12:12.082
What?

01:12:15.377 --> 01:12:16.670
Were you high?

01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:20.007
I could smell weed on you.

01:12:24.303 --> 01:12:27.139
A monster in a closet?

01:12:28.599 --> 01:12:29.892
Know what? Never mind.

01:12:30.058 --> 01:12:31.727
-You never listen to me.
-Wait.

01:12:31.894 --> 01:12:33.145
Sadie, where you going?

01:12:33.312 --> 01:12:35.522
To deal with the problem.
Somebody has to.

01:13:16.855 --> 01:13:18.565
I wasn't sure you'd come.

01:13:18.732 --> 01:13:19.900
I had to.

01:13:20.067 --> 01:13:22.569
That thing tried to kill
my little sister tonight.

01:13:26.323 --> 01:13:27.866
It must be getting hungry.

01:13:28.033 --> 01:13:30.035
You're almost out of time.

01:13:30.202 --> 01:13:34.915
If it's weakness it's drawn to,
then we've gotta show it strength.

01:13:35.082 --> 01:13:36.250
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:38.919
Watch your step.

01:13:40.170 --> 01:13:41.922
Spring-loaded firing pins.

01:13:43.757 --> 01:13:46.009
Wouldn't wanna see your head get taken off.

01:13:47.761 --> 01:13:50.180
Normally, they're used to scare off bears
when you're camping...

01:13:50.347 --> 01:13:53.392
but they're not normally loaded
with live rounds.

01:14:01.358 --> 01:14:02.985
You think you can kill it?

01:14:03.151 --> 01:14:04.820
Only one way to find out.

01:14:08.991 --> 01:14:10.617
No!

01:14:13.078 --> 01:14:13.996
I'm sorry!

01:14:14.705 --> 01:14:15.914
I needed something to draw it out!

01:14:16.081 --> 01:14:17.207
No!

01:14:18.083 --> 01:14:19.626
-I won't let anything happen to you.
-No!

01:14:19.793 --> 01:14:21.336
You just gotta trust me.

01:14:38.645 --> 01:14:40.439
Sadie.

01:16:18.620 --> 01:16:20.414
Told you it could be killed.

01:16:29.631 --> 01:16:31.091
Sadie!

01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:32.759
Sadie, help!

01:16:32.926 --> 01:16:34.011
Sadie, help me!

01:16:34.845 --> 01:16:35.679
Sadie...

01:17:11.256 --> 01:17:12.216
Dad?

01:17:12.925 --> 01:17:14.676
Where have you been?

01:17:14.843 --> 01:17:16.720
We've been driving around looking for you.

01:17:17.763 --> 01:17:19.097
You guys are home?

01:17:19.765 --> 01:17:21.016
Yeah, we just got back. Why?

01:17:21.183 --> 01:17:22.601
Listen to me, just go back to the car.

01:17:22.768 --> 01:17:24.102
Go somewhere bright with lots of people.

01:17:24.269 --> 01:17:25.771
You need to get outta there...

01:17:25.938 --> 01:17:27.272
-before it comes back.
-Wait. Slow down.

01:17:27.439 --> 01:17:29.733
Dad, you have to listen to me.

01:17:29.900 --> 01:17:32.152
Okay.
I'm listening.

01:17:32.319 --> 01:17:36.114
Go somewhere with lots of light
and lots of people, okay?

01:17:36.281 --> 01:17:38.242
Dad. Dad?

01:19:18.675 --> 01:19:19.510
God!

01:19:19.676 --> 01:19:21.512
Sawyer, it's me!

01:19:23.514 --> 01:19:24.890
How do I know it's really you?

01:19:29.394 --> 01:19:35.108
You had your sixth birthday party
at Chuck E. Cheese.

01:19:35.275 --> 01:19:37.236
You ate too much pizza...

01:19:37.402 --> 01:19:40.197
and then you threw up in the ball pit.

01:19:46.286 --> 01:19:47.246
Oh, my God.

01:19:47.412 --> 01:19:49.998
Sawyer!
Are you okay? What happened?

01:19:51.041 --> 01:19:53.252
-What happened?
-It doesn't like the light.

01:19:57.005 --> 01:19:58.632
Where's Dad?

01:20:03.762 --> 01:20:04.930
It took him down there.

01:20:13.856 --> 01:20:17.067
We are not going to lose him, too.

01:20:17.985 --> 01:20:19.111
Sadie...

01:20:19.278 --> 01:20:20.904
what are you doing?

01:20:21.071 --> 01:20:21.989
Where are you going?

01:20:22.406 --> 01:20:23.699
Sadie, don't leave me here.

01:20:24.533 --> 01:20:26.994
You'll be safe.

01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:30.038
I saw it bleed.
It can be hurt.

01:20:30.581 --> 01:20:32.332
Maybe we can stop it.

01:22:55.767 --> 01:22:56.852
Sawyer!

01:23:08.030 --> 01:23:09.364
Sawyer, get up!

01:23:09.531 --> 01:23:10.949
Please. Sawyer!

01:24:11.677 --> 01:24:13.554
Hush now.

01:24:29.361 --> 01:24:30.404
-No!
-Dad!

01:24:31.697 --> 01:24:32.698
Dad!

01:24:35.617 --> 01:24:36.618
Sawyer!

01:24:45.002 --> 01:24:46.003
Sawyer?

01:24:49.756 --> 01:24:51.758
Sawyer? Sawyer, it's me, Sadie.

01:24:51.925 --> 01:24:53.635
Look at me, please. Come on.

01:24:53.802 --> 01:24:56.054
Hey. We're gonna get outta here.

01:25:07.482 --> 01:25:09.401
-Dad.
-Give me that.

01:25:09.568 --> 01:25:11.361
Grab his arm. Grab his arm.
Come on. Get him up.

01:25:11.528 --> 01:25:12.362
-We've gotta get him outta here.
-I can't.

01:25:12.529 --> 01:25:13.447
Come on. Yes, you can.

01:25:13.906 --> 01:25:14.907
Come on.

01:25:19.745 --> 01:25:21.538
Get him up. Get him.

01:25:22.289 --> 01:25:23.540
I'm sorry.

01:25:39.681 --> 01:25:40.682
Sadie?

01:26:05.582 --> 01:26:06.625
Mom.

01:26:14.007 --> 01:26:15.092
Sadie?

01:26:16.510 --> 01:26:17.678
Sadie?

01:26:22.975 --> 01:26:23.851
Sawyer!

01:26:59.511 --> 01:27:00.762
Fuck you.

01:28:22.052 --> 01:28:23.053
Goodbye.

01:28:44.491 --> 01:28:45.617
We're almost there.

01:28:46.743 --> 01:28:47.744
Come on.

01:29:24.781 --> 01:29:26.283
I was terrified.

01:29:31.288 --> 01:29:32.873
To be honest with you...

01:29:35.417 --> 01:29:37.711
I was scared to be a dad.

01:29:39.755 --> 01:29:40.756
I was scared.

01:29:41.673 --> 01:29:44.051
I didn't know if I could handle it.

01:29:44.218 --> 01:29:46.261
Or if I was ready.

01:29:46.970 --> 01:29:49.264
Mom made it all look easy.

01:29:50.557 --> 01:29:52.267
Nothing fazed her, you know?

01:29:53.560 --> 01:29:54.978
And I...

01:29:55.145 --> 01:29:56.146
I figured...

01:29:57.981 --> 01:30:00.275
when I screwed up,
that she'd always be there.

01:30:00.442 --> 01:30:01.443
And then...

01:30:03.654 --> 01:30:05.155
Then all of a sudden she wasn't.

01:30:13.038 --> 01:30:15.791
I see so much of her in you girls.

01:30:18.001 --> 01:30:19.253
So much.

01:30:21.255 --> 01:30:24.716
I never planned on doing any of this
without Mom.

01:30:27.928 --> 01:30:28.929
No.

01:30:29.972 --> 01:30:31.473
But I know we can handle it.

01:30:34.518 --> 01:30:35.519
Yeah.

01:30:35.686 --> 01:30:37.062
-Right?
-Mm-hmm.

01:30:50.367 --> 01:30:51.493
That sucked.

01:30:54.872 --> 01:30:58.000
Yeah, because it's bread,
and bagels are bread.

01:30:59.960 --> 01:31:02.004
Sadie, could you come back in for a sec?

01:31:11.847 --> 01:31:12.848
Dr. Weller?

01:31:20.189 --> 01:31:21.190
Hello?

01:31:55.557 --> 01:31:56.850
Can I help you with something?

01:32:01.855 --> 01:32:03.273
Is everything all right?
