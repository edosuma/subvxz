00:07.275 --> 00:09.310
*

00:39.607 --> 00:41.342
*

00:59.193 --> 01:01.295
*

01:29.390 --> 01:30.858
Nice doggies.

01:30.891 --> 01:32.560
Good boys.

01:48.376 --> 01:51.345
You got owned, bitches!

01:56.817 --> 01:59.387
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

01:59.420 --> 02:01.922
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

02:01.955 --> 02:04.592
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

02:04.625 --> 02:05.859
* How, how, how, how

02:05.893 --> 02:08.229
* Hey, hey

02:14.235 --> 02:15.503
* You gotta come on.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.810
So, wait, this is...

02:22.843 --> 02:25.379
LASALLE: Storage warehouse
for Mardi Gras floats.

02:25.413 --> 02:27.881
Think of it as long-term parking
for voodoo queens

02:27.915 --> 02:30.351
and demonic court jesters.

02:30.384 --> 02:33.287
Yeah, a month out of the year,
it's a hub of activity.

02:33.321 --> 02:35.956
The other 11 months, it's a home
for dogs, vagrants...

02:35.989 --> 02:39.393
And apparently,
guys stealing copper wires.

02:39.427 --> 02:41.229
I cannot wait
for my first Mardi Gras.

02:41.262 --> 02:42.530
Oh, it's fantastic.

02:42.563 --> 02:44.298
You never seen
anything like it.

02:44.332 --> 02:46.834
I don't know. Summer after
my sophomore year of college,

02:46.867 --> 02:49.837
I worked at an amusement park,
they had a piano-playing pig--

02:49.870 --> 02:52.673
"Pigeracci."
Pigeracci would
fit right in.

02:52.706 --> 02:55.276
We got to stop meeting
like this, Loretta.

02:55.309 --> 02:56.344
Isn't that
the truth.

02:56.377 --> 02:58.246
NOPD's been
processing the scene.

02:58.279 --> 03:00.214
Petty Officer Jonathan Bell.

03:02.616 --> 03:04.652
Yeah, flag writer
for Admiral Hume's office

03:04.685 --> 03:05.953
in Belle Chasse.

03:05.986 --> 03:08.489
Uh, Hume is in charge
of Naval facilities

03:08.522 --> 03:10.591
for the Southeast Region.

03:10.624 --> 03:12.293
SEBASTIAN:
I'll take that.

03:12.326 --> 03:14.328
I'm just cataloguing
the evidence.

03:14.362 --> 03:15.796
My girlfriend Melissa
keeps pushing me

03:15.829 --> 03:17.731
to get out into
the real world some more,

03:17.765 --> 03:20.000
so I kind of
volunteered for assignment.

03:20.033 --> 03:22.002
There's a girlfriend,
Melissa?

03:22.035 --> 03:23.404
Cause of death?

03:23.437 --> 03:25.406
Shot in the heart,
about 10:00 last night.

03:25.439 --> 03:28.008
Two .45-caliber shell casings.

03:28.041 --> 03:29.410
And three bullet holes.

03:29.443 --> 03:31.712
Two in his back,
lower flank...

03:32.613 --> 03:34.448
...one center mass.

03:35.716 --> 03:37.451
One possibly an exit?

03:37.485 --> 03:38.686
I don't think so.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.954
These two wounds
look to be roughly...

03:40.988 --> 03:43.424
a centimeter in diameter.

03:43.457 --> 03:45.626
The kill shot-- larger.

03:45.659 --> 03:47.428
Bigger caliber.

03:47.461 --> 03:49.497
Two separate weapons?
Likely.

03:49.530 --> 03:50.331
But...

03:50.364 --> 03:51.465
Wait for an autopsy.

03:52.533 --> 03:53.801
LASALLE:
Roses over here

03:53.834 --> 03:55.603
suggest he was
meeting someone.

03:56.804 --> 03:59.640
Ah, not just anybody.

03:59.673 --> 04:03.611
I found this
in his pocket.

04:03.644 --> 04:06.347
Engagement ring?
If it was robbery,

04:06.380 --> 04:07.581
the box would be empty.

04:07.615 --> 04:09.683
BRODY: So...
marriage proposal

04:09.717 --> 04:11.385
gone horribly wrong?

04:11.419 --> 04:13.354
I think his first mistake
was probably the setting.

04:13.387 --> 04:15.523
Or... she just
doesn't like roses.

04:15.556 --> 04:18.926
I don't think it's about that--
I found that in his jacket.

04:21.329 --> 04:22.896
"12 Roses, 12 Reasons."

04:22.930 --> 04:25.366
Poor guy.
Must've been nervous.

04:25.399 --> 04:27.401
List of things
they have in common:

04:27.435 --> 04:29.737
"Love of carnival."
"Passion for zydeco music."

04:29.770 --> 04:32.440
"Favorite book, A Prayer for
Owen Meany by John Irving."

04:32.473 --> 04:34.542
"Whenever I'm having a
hard time, I think of you

04:34.575 --> 04:36.610
and realize we are
perfect for each other."

04:36.644 --> 04:39.413
Sounds like the lyrics
to a Celine Dion song.

04:39.447 --> 04:41.882
Oh, not that I'd know.

04:41.915 --> 04:44.318
Cell phone?

04:44.352 --> 04:45.486
Yeah. All right.

04:45.519 --> 04:47.054
That should tell us plenty

04:47.087 --> 04:49.557
about what Petty Officer Bell's
been up to.

04:49.590 --> 04:51.091
Follow up with the family,

04:51.124 --> 04:53.327
Admiral Hume's office.

04:53.361 --> 04:56.530
Find someone who can give us
a name to put with these roses.

05:00.033 --> 05:02.370
Chris Lasalle!

05:02.403 --> 05:04.438
Chief Petty Officer
Phil Martino!

05:04.472 --> 05:06.674
How you doing? All right.
Good. How are you?
Good to see you.

05:06.707 --> 05:08.108
Special Agent Brody.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.411
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Pleasure.
Special Agent Pride.

05:10.444 --> 05:12.880
I met Phil and his son
when I was visiting the
children's hospital.

05:12.913 --> 05:15.082
Thought he was the clown
meant to entertain the kids.

05:15.115 --> 05:17.385
Only I wasn't wearing
a clown suit.

05:17.418 --> 05:19.920
It was an honest mistake,
but, I mean, come on, right?

05:19.953 --> 05:21.555
Not gonna touch that.

05:21.589 --> 05:23.056
How is little Robbie?

05:23.090 --> 05:24.692
He's about the same.

05:24.725 --> 05:27.094
Thanks for asking.

05:27.127 --> 05:30.898
I assume you're here about what
happened to Petty Officer Bell.

05:30.931 --> 05:32.099
You knew him?

05:32.132 --> 05:33.734
I trained him.
He was my replacement

05:33.767 --> 05:35.569
when I left Admiral Hume
for an assignment

05:35.603 --> 05:37.938
with Admiral Fleetwood.
In fact, I had to tell Jonathan

05:37.971 --> 05:39.473
to stop doing
such a good job.

05:39.507 --> 05:41.742
He was making me look bad
in retrospect.

05:41.775 --> 05:43.411
Given the tragedy,
I'm covering Hume's desk

05:43.444 --> 05:45.413
until they can find
a replacement.

05:45.446 --> 05:47.581
Well, uh, I'll
let you get to it.

05:47.615 --> 05:50.751
Hey, let's grab a beer when
you got a minute or two.
I'd love that. Pleasure.

05:51.785 --> 05:53.454
Only thing harder

05:53.487 --> 05:56.724
than a sick kid is
a parent with a sick kid.

06:00.728 --> 06:03.497
Petty Officer Bell
was an outstanding young man,

06:03.531 --> 06:05.699
both personally
and professionally.

06:05.733 --> 06:08.135
Hard-working,
meticulous.

06:08.168 --> 06:10.671
He managed my schedule--
set up meetings,

06:10.704 --> 06:14.642
dinner reservations, and...
told me what time to work out.

06:14.675 --> 06:16.944
We're looking into
his personal life at the moment.

06:16.977 --> 06:19.980
Specifically, who he might have
been romantically involved with.

06:20.013 --> 06:21.915
Uh, that would be Maria.

06:24.151 --> 06:26.787
Happen to have a last name
and address for Maria?

06:26.820 --> 06:29.423
Last name's Garcia,
and I think she was living

06:29.457 --> 06:31.559
in Los Angeles,
but they were in the process

06:31.592 --> 06:33.627
of moving her
out here.
Do you know

06:33.661 --> 06:35.496
if they were having
any problems?
Why?

06:35.529 --> 06:36.797
You think she shot him?

06:36.830 --> 06:38.432
He was crazy
about her.

06:38.466 --> 06:40.133
Said she was
his soul mate.

06:40.167 --> 06:42.970
I didn't know her, but they
seemed to be very much in love.

06:43.003 --> 06:44.505
Sir?

06:44.538 --> 06:46.874
I'm sorry.
Excuse me for a moment.

06:49.543 --> 06:51.712
Okay, so...

06:51.745 --> 06:54.582
Maria Garcia-- at best,

06:54.615 --> 06:56.584
a potential witness.

06:56.617 --> 06:57.851
At worst...

06:57.885 --> 06:59.853
Suspect numero uno.

06:59.887 --> 07:01.154
Find her...

07:01.188 --> 07:03.791
so we can figure out
which one it is.

07:03.824 --> 07:08.462
There are 25,000
Maria Garcias in
Los Angeles County.

07:08.496 --> 07:11.465
We logged into
California's DMV database,

07:11.499 --> 07:13.233
but so far no matches
to her picture.

07:13.266 --> 07:15.569
We're checking into
airlines, bus lines, hotels

07:15.603 --> 07:19.740
to see if anyone with
that name came to New
Orleans recently. But...

07:19.773 --> 07:22.743
Takes time.
We took the contacts
from Bell's cell,

07:22.776 --> 07:25.479
and we left messages
via phone, e-mail and text.

07:25.513 --> 07:27.681
We're working
with her providers to try

07:27.715 --> 07:30.250
to come up with
a billing address.
Okay, so I dug deep

07:30.283 --> 07:32.252
into Bell's digital life,
and I got access

07:32.285 --> 07:33.821
to his online social media.

07:33.854 --> 07:36.089
Couple of interesting things.

07:36.123 --> 07:38.091
Number one,
he changed his status

07:38.125 --> 07:40.260
to "in a relationship
with Maria Garcia."

07:40.293 --> 07:42.863
Well, considering he was
about to propose to her,

07:42.896 --> 07:44.865
not really news.
No, the news is,

07:44.898 --> 07:46.600
moments after
he changed his status

07:46.634 --> 07:48.168
he started
being threatened online

07:48.201 --> 07:51.539
by some surly local dude
named Rodney Abbott.

07:51.572 --> 07:54.675
Define "threatened."
"Stay away from Maria
or I'll cut out your heart."

07:54.708 --> 07:57.210
Subtle.
Oh, not only that,

07:57.244 --> 08:00.047
this Rodney Abbott
also changed his status recently

08:00.080 --> 08:02.683
to "in a relationship
with Maria Garcia."

08:02.716 --> 08:04.618
Well, getting involved with
two guys in the same city

08:04.652 --> 08:05.853
seems a little risky.

08:05.886 --> 08:08.188
A love triangle
gone bad.

08:08.221 --> 08:10.624
Is a love triangle
ever a good thing?

08:10.658 --> 08:12.560
I've made it work
from time to time.

08:14.294 --> 08:16.029
PRIDE:
Okay, so...

08:16.063 --> 08:19.767
25,000 Maria Garcias
in Los Angeles.

08:19.800 --> 08:23.236
How many Rodney Abbotts
in New Orleans?

08:29.777 --> 08:31.044
What?

08:31.078 --> 08:33.080
Rodney Abbott?

08:33.113 --> 08:34.582
Who wants to know?

08:34.615 --> 08:36.049
NCIS. You got a minute?

08:36.083 --> 08:38.619
Not really.

08:38.652 --> 08:40.087
You do now.
It's a warrant

08:40.120 --> 08:42.590
for cyber-threatening
Petty Officer Jonathan Bell.

08:42.623 --> 08:45.258
PRIDE: We're gonna
take a look around.

08:48.095 --> 08:50.598
BRODY :
Looks like a thrift store

08:50.631 --> 08:52.933
took a crap in here.

08:52.966 --> 08:55.002
I'm recording this.

08:55.035 --> 08:57.037
In case you guys get
all brutal on me.

09:00.007 --> 09:02.275
Pride...

09:06.947 --> 09:09.249
Go on.

09:12.219 --> 09:13.353
Get up against
the wall.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.589
Hands out where
I can see 'em.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.927
I got this.

09:27.234 --> 09:28.702
You know a man
named Jonathan Bell?

09:28.736 --> 09:29.937
I don't gotta answer that.

09:29.970 --> 09:31.872
No, you
don't "gotta."

09:31.905 --> 09:34.742
But I'm suggesting
it's in your best interest.

09:34.775 --> 09:38.378
Hey, King, I found something.

09:38.411 --> 09:41.014
.45 caliber--
same as the murder weapon.

09:41.048 --> 09:43.350
Two bullets missing.

09:43.383 --> 09:46.286
And we found
two shell casings--
imagine that.

09:46.319 --> 09:49.757
Now we're more
in the area of "gotta."

09:51.091 --> 09:52.693
BRODY :
Why'd you do it?

09:52.726 --> 09:54.294
He was messing
with my girl.

09:54.327 --> 09:56.730
Maria Garcia?

09:56.764 --> 09:59.733
I told him to stay away,
and he didn't,

09:59.767 --> 10:01.769
so... bam, bam!

10:01.802 --> 10:05.205
Two shots-- that was
the end of that.

10:05.238 --> 10:08.642
Who's behind
that glass there?

10:08.676 --> 10:09.810
I know you're
back there!

10:09.843 --> 10:11.679
Sit down.

10:13.013 --> 10:15.816
How's it going?
I think we should get

10:15.849 --> 10:19.152
a 72-hour psych hold
on Mr. Abbott there, but...

10:19.186 --> 10:22.790
we may have just set
a speed record
for solving a case.

10:22.823 --> 10:24.424
About that.
Hm?

10:24.457 --> 10:26.760
While you're getting
that psych hold,

10:26.794 --> 10:28.996
Loretta has some news.

10:30.698 --> 10:32.332
Don't think
Abbott was your killer.

10:32.365 --> 10:35.435
He confessed.
Science doesn't care
about the lies men tell.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.671
Sebastian said the
ballistics matched.

10:37.705 --> 10:40.674
They do.
And Rodney's fingerprints
are on the shell casings.

10:40.708 --> 10:41.909
They are.
But...?

10:41.942 --> 10:44.011
Remember I told you

10:44.044 --> 10:47.447
it looked like he was shot by
two different caliber bullets?

10:47.480 --> 10:49.783
Turns out to be the case.

10:49.817 --> 10:51.418
He was shot
three times--

10:51.451 --> 10:54.855
twice by Rodney's .45,
and once...

10:54.888 --> 10:57.424
by a .30 caliber.

10:57.457 --> 11:00.861
Likely a rifle, based
on the tissue and bone damage.

11:00.894 --> 11:03.263
I found this embedded
in the spleen.

11:03.296 --> 11:05.265
Abbott only confessed
to two shots.

11:05.298 --> 11:07.000
Here's the important part:

11:07.034 --> 11:10.403
The .30 caliber is the
shot that killed him.

11:10.437 --> 11:13.406
Abbott's two bullets came
after Bell died,

11:13.440 --> 11:15.909
after there was no blood flow.

11:15.943 --> 11:19.813
Abbott shot a guy
who was already dead?

11:19.847 --> 11:21.849
And your .30-caliber killer...

11:21.882 --> 11:24.852
is still out there somewhere.

11:33.326 --> 11:35.896
You lied to us.
What are you
talking about?

11:35.929 --> 11:37.931
I told you, I shot
the jerk twice.

11:37.965 --> 11:39.399
I'll take a
lie detector.

11:39.432 --> 11:42.035
The coroner's report
says that...

11:42.069 --> 11:44.805
your shots were fired
postmortem.

11:44.838 --> 11:48.375
That means after his death.
I know what it means. You don't
think I know what it means?

11:48.408 --> 11:51.111
It's hard for us to tell
right now what you know
and what you don't.

11:51.144 --> 11:53.847
I know lots of stuff
you don't think I don't know.

11:53.881 --> 11:55.115
Okay, then...

11:55.148 --> 11:57.117
tell us who killed
Petty Officer Bell.

11:57.150 --> 12:00.754
Look... I met Maria for drinks.

12:00.788 --> 12:03.190
She begged me to help her get
away from what's his name.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.925
He was "suffocating" her.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.760
Her words.

12:06.794 --> 12:09.196
She told me she thought he
was gonna pop the question.

12:09.229 --> 12:10.463
At a storage warehouse?

12:10.497 --> 12:12.933
Maria had a thing
for Mardi Gras.

12:12.966 --> 12:14.167
It was one of
the reasons

12:14.201 --> 12:16.069
she wanted to move out here.

12:16.103 --> 12:18.071
:
I mean, come on.

12:18.105 --> 12:20.240
So on the nose.

12:20.273 --> 12:23.911
Besides, it didn't matter where
that guy got down on one knee,

12:23.944 --> 12:26.246
'cause Maria,
she was always gonna say no.

12:26.279 --> 12:29.016
So then I...
I went over there

12:29.049 --> 12:31.051
to tell him to get lost.

12:31.084 --> 12:34.021
He was already dead
when I got there.

12:34.054 --> 12:36.323
So you shot him
anyway?

12:36.356 --> 12:39.326
Well, I felt
like he deserved it.

12:39.359 --> 12:41.028
I mean, it's not a crime

12:41.061 --> 12:43.263
if someone else
killed him first, is it?

12:43.296 --> 12:45.398
We need to talk to Maria.

12:45.432 --> 12:46.867
Well, I already told you, Maria,

12:46.900 --> 12:48.168
she didn't have anything
to do with this.

12:48.201 --> 12:50.237
Well, then she doesn't have
anything to sorry about.

12:50.270 --> 12:51.905
We just want
to talk to her.

12:51.939 --> 12:53.240
Where is she, Rodney?

12:56.209 --> 12:57.945
BRODY: We think Rodney's
covering for Maria.

12:57.978 --> 13:01.048
He may have followed
Maria Garcia to the warehouse,

13:01.081 --> 13:03.250
saw her shoot Bell,
then he puts two slugs

13:03.283 --> 13:06.019
into Bell's corpse
to make it look like he did it.

13:06.053 --> 13:07.487
Seems like he'd
rather take the rap

13:07.520 --> 13:10.123
for a murder he didn't
commit than give her up.

13:10.157 --> 13:11.124
Now, that's love--

13:11.158 --> 13:13.861
in a John Hinckley,
bat-poop, wacky sort of way.

13:13.894 --> 13:15.162
That's a theory.

13:15.195 --> 13:18.498
One I'd like to talk
with her about directly.

13:20.233 --> 13:22.202
Text from Maria's
phone carrier.

13:22.235 --> 13:25.338
Bill went to a P.O. box,
paid for with cash.

13:25.372 --> 13:29.042
Order to discontinue
phone service was
put in this morning.

13:29.076 --> 13:31.344
What about
Rodney's neighbors?

13:31.378 --> 13:34.214
NOPD showed Maria
Garcia's photo around.

13:34.247 --> 13:36.483
No one's seen her.

13:36.516 --> 13:39.286
Same with Petty Officer
Bell's apartment.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.521
No sign of Garcia.

13:42.923 --> 13:44.925
She's going underground.

13:44.958 --> 13:48.028
SEBASTIAN: Her Instagram
was just deactivated.

13:48.061 --> 13:49.362
Same with the
Twitter account.

13:49.396 --> 13:51.364
She just deleted
all her remaining
online accounts.

13:51.398 --> 13:52.532
Well, that's all right.

13:52.565 --> 13:54.067
I'll find her.

13:54.101 --> 13:56.003
Nobody gets away
from Double P, baby.

13:56.036 --> 13:57.637
Double P?

13:57.670 --> 13:59.306
Yeah, that's my nickname.

13:59.339 --> 14:00.908
Nobody calls you that.

14:00.941 --> 14:03.143
I do.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.012
You can't give yourself
a nickname.

14:05.045 --> 14:07.014
Why not?
You just...
you can't.

14:07.047 --> 14:08.548
It's a known rule.

14:08.581 --> 14:11.084
You're breaking
a known rule.
Wait a minute.

14:11.118 --> 14:13.253
You're supposed to be
helping me-- why is there
a ape on your screen?

14:13.286 --> 14:15.455
A, it's not an ape,
it's a yeti, all right?

14:15.488 --> 14:17.124
And B, I am
helping you--

14:17.157 --> 14:18.926
I just also happen to be
having a conversation

14:18.959 --> 14:20.928
with my girlfriend
about the Ape Canyon conspiracy.

14:20.961 --> 14:23.430
Well, A, I would very
much like to lay eyes

14:23.463 --> 14:25.098
on said girlfriend;

14:25.132 --> 14:27.367
and B, this is the way
the conversation should go.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.502
Is there a such thing
as a yeti? No.

14:29.536 --> 14:31.104
Well, we have
a different point of view.

14:31.138 --> 14:32.572
No, you don't have a
different point of view.

14:32.605 --> 14:34.374
You're just wrong.
There's a huge difference.

14:34.407 --> 14:35.976
Oh, wait a minute.

14:36.009 --> 14:39.046
I knew she'd make
a mistake. Yeah,

14:39.079 --> 14:41.248
she's back online.
Well, track her IP address.

14:41.281 --> 14:43.450
That's what I'm doing,
Captain Obvious.

14:43.483 --> 14:45.685
All right, stay on there, baby.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.988
Just a little longer.

14:48.021 --> 14:50.023
Yeah, that's it.
Yeah.

14:50.057 --> 14:51.624
Right on, right on.

14:51.658 --> 14:53.593
Keep on going.

14:53.626 --> 14:55.262
Unh.

14:55.295 --> 14:57.530
Yes! Got a IP address.

14:57.564 --> 14:59.099
She's on her
cell phone,

14:59.132 --> 15:00.367
just by Chartres
and Dumaine.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.102
Okay, I'll call Pride.
Call Pride.

15:02.135 --> 15:03.603
I just said
I'm gonna call Pride.

15:06.573 --> 15:09.142
We're at the corner
of Chartres and Dumaine.

15:09.176 --> 15:10.610
PATTON :
She's traveling westbound

15:10.643 --> 15:12.179
towards Madison.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.315
I'll go this way.

15:15.348 --> 15:16.950
You two head up Decatur.

15:20.287 --> 15:21.955
PATTON: Signal shows
that she should be

15:21.989 --> 15:23.290
right there in front of you.

15:29.462 --> 15:31.164
I don't see her.
Gotta be there.

15:31.198 --> 15:33.066
I got both of your phones
on the screen.

15:37.404 --> 15:39.739
Only one person on the phone--
it's a guy.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.174
Is he texting?

15:41.208 --> 15:43.643
PRIDE:
He's... typing.

15:43.676 --> 15:45.312
Then that's your guy.

15:45.345 --> 15:47.014
You sure?

15:47.047 --> 15:48.648
He's got to be using
Maria's phone.

15:48.681 --> 15:50.450
NCIS!

15:51.751 --> 15:53.353
PRIDE:
He's headed down Madison.

15:55.488 --> 15:57.224
LASALLE:
NCIS!
Cool! Cool!

15:57.257 --> 15:58.458
Keep your hands
where I can see 'em.

15:58.491 --> 15:59.959
Ooh, take it easy.

16:02.329 --> 16:04.131
BRODY:
I'll circle around.

16:06.466 --> 16:08.668
PRIDE:
Hands against the wall!

16:08.701 --> 16:10.270
Now.

16:12.739 --> 16:14.407
Where is she?

16:14.441 --> 16:15.475
Who?

16:15.508 --> 16:17.444
Maria Garcia.

16:17.477 --> 16:19.079
Is this a joke?

16:19.112 --> 16:22.382
Do I look like
I'm joking to you?

16:22.415 --> 16:24.351
Where is she?
She's nowhere.

16:25.585 --> 16:27.287
I made her up.

16:30.390 --> 16:32.592
There's no such person
as Maria Garcia.

16:44.437 --> 16:46.606
Maria Garcia is
a figment, a ghost,

16:46.639 --> 16:48.641
a completely made-up person.

16:48.675 --> 16:52.412
Her pictures.
Stolen from a Brazilian Web site
for amateur models.

16:52.445 --> 16:54.414
Her love of Carnival,
her passion for zydeco,

16:54.447 --> 16:55.582
favorite book?

16:55.615 --> 16:57.350
All stuff I created.

16:57.384 --> 16:59.052
He's a catfisher.

16:59.086 --> 17:00.353
Person who
pretends to be

17:00.387 --> 17:02.155
someone he's not by creating

17:02.189 --> 17:04.124
a false online identity
and tricking people

17:04.157 --> 17:05.292
into a relationship.

17:05.325 --> 17:07.127
Why the hell would you do that?

17:07.160 --> 17:08.228
What's it matter to you?

17:08.261 --> 17:09.529
Hey, wait a second.

17:09.562 --> 17:11.198
Rodney said
he had drinks with Maria.

17:11.231 --> 17:12.532
Rodney Abbott?

17:12.565 --> 17:14.501
Dude is delusional.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.536
He stumbled across my profile
for Maria online,

17:16.569 --> 17:18.505
and I could not
get rid of him.

17:18.538 --> 17:19.772
He sent me Photoshopped
pictures

17:19.806 --> 17:22.075
of him and Maria
like they were a real couple.

17:22.109 --> 17:24.144
You mind taking
these off?

17:24.177 --> 17:26.546
'Cause I've done
nothing illegal.
Not so fast.

17:26.579 --> 17:29.382
Why don't you tell us where you
were last night around 10:00.

17:29.416 --> 17:31.651
Around the corner
at the coffee shop on Dauphine.

17:31.684 --> 17:33.320
Anyone corroborate that?

17:33.353 --> 17:34.454
The barista knows me.

17:34.487 --> 17:36.223
Plus they've got
security video in there.

17:36.256 --> 17:38.291
You could check it
if you don't believe me.

17:39.592 --> 17:41.561
Get him up.

17:43.696 --> 17:46.099
So you had nothing to do

17:46.133 --> 17:49.169
with Petty Officer
Bell's murder?

17:49.202 --> 17:50.870
Bell's dead?

17:50.903 --> 17:52.605
That surprise you?

17:57.510 --> 17:59.546
What else do you know, Marco?

17:59.579 --> 18:01.881
I don't know a damn thing.

18:01.914 --> 18:04.417
And if you're
not going to arrest me,

18:04.451 --> 18:06.153
I want to go home,

18:06.186 --> 18:08.288
or I want my lawyer.

18:08.321 --> 18:11.291
LASALLE:
See how nervous Drayer was?

18:11.324 --> 18:13.593
There's no way he
didn't know something
about Bell's murder.

18:13.626 --> 18:17.464
He created Maria Garcia
specifically to attract
Petty Officer Bell.

18:17.497 --> 18:19.466
What kind of person
proposes to someone

18:19.499 --> 18:23.436
they've never even met?
It happens more times
than you think.

18:23.470 --> 18:25.772
Remember that Notre Dame
football player?

18:25.805 --> 18:29.309
He was engaged to a woman...
turned out to be a man.

18:29.342 --> 18:31.611
Same thing as this.
People are willing
to ignore

18:31.644 --> 18:34.481
all the warning signs for
the possibility of love.

18:34.514 --> 18:37.817
Bell wanted to be in love--
that's what he was up to.

18:37.850 --> 18:40.620
Rodney Abbott is
12 varieties of...

18:40.653 --> 18:42.589
mixed nuts, but...

18:42.622 --> 18:44.591
Drayer's none of those.

18:44.624 --> 18:47.560
So why catfish
Petty Officer Bell?

18:47.594 --> 18:50.230
Attention. Money.

18:50.263 --> 18:52.232
Information.

18:52.265 --> 18:55.635
Call Sebastian--
find out where he's at
with Bell's computer.

18:55.668 --> 18:58.205
We need a reason
to bring Drayer in.

18:58.238 --> 19:00.240
Everybody's got
an Achilles heel.

19:00.273 --> 19:01.541
Find his.

19:01.574 --> 19:03.610
Marco Drayer's digital footprint
is very small.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.712
He likes living below the radar.

19:05.745 --> 19:08.715
He's a self-employed computer
security specialist.

19:08.748 --> 19:11.284
Man like this, I got to respect.

19:11.318 --> 19:14.221
And yet he got on the radar
to con Petty Officer Bell.

19:14.254 --> 19:16.856
PATTON: No. What I'm saying is,
this is a first.

19:16.889 --> 19:18.591
His catfishing scheme.
The only other time

19:18.625 --> 19:21.528
Drayer pops up on the Internet
is as a member of Stealth,

19:21.561 --> 19:23.930
the anti-military
"hacktivist" group.

19:23.963 --> 19:25.698
They're like
the group Anonymous,

19:25.732 --> 19:28.568
only less anonymous.
"Achieving peace
by going to war

19:28.601 --> 19:30.637
with the military-
industrial complex."

19:30.670 --> 19:33.773
You think Bell's death was part
of some anti

19:33.806 --> 19:36.409
I have no idea.
But what I do know,

19:36.443 --> 19:38.711
that there was
a anti-military
hacktivist that was

19:38.745 --> 19:41.614
catfishing a guy in the Navy,
looking for some information

19:41.648 --> 19:42.815
to do... something.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.651
James Walker,
the founder

19:44.684 --> 19:46.686
of Stealth,
is doing time at Oakdale.

19:46.719 --> 19:49.256
He was convicted
of DDoS attacks that temporarily

19:49.289 --> 19:51.591
shut down a bunch
of military Web sites.

19:51.624 --> 19:54.894
Maybe he can give us some intel
to help us lean on Drayer.

19:54.927 --> 19:57.730
I'll call Pride, see if
he'll join me to meet Walker.

19:57.764 --> 20:00.600
I'm gonna go meet
a buddy, Chief Martino.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.935
He was Bell
before Bell was Bell.

20:02.969 --> 20:04.571
Maybe his path crossed
with Drayer's

20:04.604 --> 20:06.673
when he worked in
Admiral Hume's office.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.375
I've never heard of Drayer,
but, I mean,

20:08.408 --> 20:10.277
that doesn't mean anything--
military Web sites

20:10.310 --> 20:12.912
are targets for lots of groups.

20:12.945 --> 20:15.482
Think this ties in
with Jonathan's death?

20:15.515 --> 20:17.450
We don't know yet.

20:17.484 --> 20:19.852
Jonathan was a good kid.

20:19.886 --> 20:22.622
You know, he was helping
with Robbie's charity.

20:22.655 --> 20:24.791
I didn't even ask him to--
he just showed up

20:24.824 --> 20:27.360
and donated his time
and helped us raise money.

20:27.394 --> 20:30.530
Hey, did Robbie ever get that...
Replica NCIS badge?
Are you kidding me?

20:30.563 --> 20:31.864
He wears it constantly.

20:31.898 --> 20:33.766
He tried to arrest
the neighbors the other day.

20:33.800 --> 20:36.469
Tell him I'll give him
a call when I'm in a fix.

20:36.503 --> 20:37.970
I will, I will.
He'd love that.

20:38.004 --> 20:40.707
He'd probably wait
by the phone.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.975
Man, you know, the kid
was dealt a tough hand,

20:43.009 --> 20:45.645
but he's always got
a smile on his face.

20:45.678 --> 20:46.813
And you?

20:46.846 --> 20:48.315
It, uh...

20:48.348 --> 20:49.649
it's a struggle.

20:49.682 --> 20:51.418
Kid requires a lot of care.

20:51.451 --> 20:54.721
But, um...
I put him to bed at night,

20:54.754 --> 20:57.390
I watch him sleep,

20:57.424 --> 20:59.826
and I-I can't imagine
my life without him.

21:01.894 --> 21:04.731
Guess once you're responsible
for another human being...

21:04.764 --> 21:07.867
things change.

21:07.900 --> 21:09.702
You understand that.

21:09.736 --> 21:11.604
My brother's issues
aren't physical.

21:11.638 --> 21:13.840
It's no less real.

21:15.608 --> 21:18.345
Yeah. Well...

21:18.378 --> 21:21.448
I feel like I've done
everything I could do for him.

21:21.481 --> 21:24.751
That's when I started going to
see the kids at the hospital.

21:24.784 --> 21:27.520
Felt good to
make 'em smile.

21:27.554 --> 21:29.856
You know, hope is still
alive, my brother.
That's right.

21:31.858 --> 21:33.993
Hey, I'm gonna throw
another name at you.
Mm-hmm.

21:34.026 --> 21:35.928
An alleged associate of
Drayer's,

21:35.962 --> 21:37.464
back in his Stealth days--

21:37.497 --> 21:38.998
James Walker.

21:40.032 --> 21:42.435
James Walker?

21:42.469 --> 21:43.836
I know that name.

21:43.870 --> 21:46.773
That guy's dangerous.

21:46.806 --> 21:49.676
PRIDE: James Walker-- hacked
into the D.O.E. Web site

21:49.709 --> 21:54.547
and stole personal details
of 100,000 employees.

21:54.581 --> 21:59.519
Shut down PayPal after
it stopped processing
donations to WikiLeaks.

21:59.552 --> 22:01.921
Hacked the U.S.
Sentencing Commission Web site,

22:01.954 --> 22:04.624
and after lifting
secured information,

22:04.657 --> 22:07.727
transformed the site
into an interactive video game

22:07.760 --> 22:09.862
of Asteroids.

22:09.896 --> 22:12.765
You know, as much as I love
hearing my credits...

22:12.799 --> 22:14.901
I already know
what I'm here for.

22:14.934 --> 22:18.738
What do you guys want?
We want to know what
Marco Drayer's involvement was.

22:18.771 --> 22:20.740
What did Drayer do now?

22:20.773 --> 22:22.709
He catfished a Navy guy.

22:22.742 --> 22:24.877
That does not sound like
the Marco Drayer that I know.

22:24.911 --> 22:28.915
Why don't you tell me about
the Marco Drayer you do know.

22:28.948 --> 22:31.884
Why should I help
you warmongers?

22:31.918 --> 22:33.586
I'll give you
the short version.

22:33.620 --> 22:34.954
Soon as we leave here,
the first call

22:34.987 --> 22:37.023
I'm gonna make is
to a guy named Andy Leeds.

22:37.056 --> 22:38.891
Is that name supposed
to mean something to me?

22:38.925 --> 22:40.793
Should. You'll be
appearing before him

22:40.827 --> 22:42.929
in two months to ask for parole.

22:44.631 --> 22:46.599
What do you think, James?

22:46.633 --> 22:49.669
You want me to say
bad things about you?

22:49.702 --> 22:52.405
You guys are trying
to blackmail me

22:52.439 --> 22:54.106
so you can pressure Drayer.

22:54.140 --> 22:56.943
I told you he'd get it.

22:56.976 --> 23:01.180
You guys ever hear
of the Conficker virus?

23:01.213 --> 23:03.816
What about it?
Drayer had
a major hand

23:03.850 --> 23:05.552
in creating it.

23:05.585 --> 23:07.587
Caused a lot of damage.

23:07.620 --> 23:09.822
If you say something to Leeds,
I'll give you enough dirt

23:09.856 --> 23:11.991
to make Drayer sing
like a canary.

23:14.761 --> 23:16.529
There he is.

23:16.563 --> 23:18.798
LASALLE: Well, it looks like
he's skipping town.

23:22.902 --> 23:24.637
LASALLE:
Drayer!

23:26.038 --> 23:28.741
Here's a warrant for you.
KING: Going somewhere?

23:28.775 --> 23:29.909
I don't know
what's going on here.

23:29.942 --> 23:31.143
I didn't sign up for this.

23:31.177 --> 23:33.513
What'd you sign up for?
Look, I was paid...

23:39.486 --> 23:41.688
Shot came from
the roof.

23:41.721 --> 23:42.689
Check him.

23:42.722 --> 23:43.990
Yeah.
Brody,

23:44.023 --> 23:44.857
cover us.

23:44.891 --> 23:46.425
Go!

23:54.133 --> 23:56.636
There goes
our best lead.

23:57.537 --> 23:59.839
I'm gonna cross the street.

23:59.872 --> 24:02.074
You cover me, meet me
on the river side,

24:02.108 --> 24:03.776
top of the roof.

24:03.810 --> 24:04.977
Ready?

24:05.011 --> 24:06.178
Go.

24:23.162 --> 24:24.664
PRIDE:
Clear!

24:24.697 --> 24:25.898
Clear!

24:43.916 --> 24:46.052
Look here.

24:53.092 --> 24:55.995
PRIDE:
.30 caliber?
Yep.

24:56.028 --> 24:57.930
Same that was used
to kill Petty Officer Bell.

25:09.609 --> 25:11.578
No surprise--
ballistics match.

25:11.611 --> 25:13.813
Same gun that was
used to kill Bell

25:13.846 --> 25:15.848
was used to
kill Drayer.

25:15.882 --> 25:17.584
And I'll bet you
dollars to donuts

25:17.617 --> 25:19.819
that the shooter is the one
who hired Drayer

25:19.852 --> 25:22.288
to do the catfishing.
Okay, so Drayer tricks Bell,

25:22.321 --> 25:25.224
starts a relationship...
Bell knew
the admiral's

25:25.257 --> 25:27.627
day-to-day schedule--
who he was meeting with,

25:27.660 --> 25:29.829
what he was doing,
where he was going.

25:29.862 --> 25:32.965
But Admiral Hume was
a facilities guy. I mean,

25:32.999 --> 25:36.268
what kind of sensitive
information would he have
that someone would kill

25:36.302 --> 25:37.704
to get ahold of.

25:37.737 --> 25:39.338
That's the question
of the day.

25:39.371 --> 25:41.307
Till we know the
answer to that...

25:41.340 --> 25:44.343
request a security detail
for Admiral Hume,

25:44.376 --> 25:46.913
and coordinate
with the P.O.F.O.,
make sure that

25:46.946 --> 25:48.280
we're looped into the
admiral's schedule.

25:48.314 --> 25:49.115
I'm on it.

25:55.622 --> 25:57.924
Sebastian's got information.

25:59.926 --> 26:02.595
SEBASTIAN: What we've got from
the Drayer-Bell online chats.

26:02.629 --> 26:05.064
It's just the usual stuff people
chat about when they're dating.

26:05.097 --> 26:08.801
Your usual and my usual
are probably not the same.

26:08.835 --> 26:11.203
You know, stuff like
what they did that day,

26:11.237 --> 26:14.306
TV shows they watch,
what funny stuff
they saw online.

26:14.340 --> 26:17.343
Is that what... you
and your girlfriend chat about?

26:20.179 --> 26:22.381
I'm not being catfished.

26:22.414 --> 26:26.052
I didn't...
I may not have met my
girlfriend in person,

26:26.085 --> 26:29.321
but I've skyped with
an actual female human being.

26:31.958 --> 26:34.393
I just asked
what you talked about.

26:34.426 --> 26:35.928
Casual question.

26:35.962 --> 26:37.930
: But since
you brought it up, I...

26:37.964 --> 26:40.800
How come you've
never met Melissa?

26:40.833 --> 26:42.835
Um...

26:42.869 --> 26:46.072
because with people--
new people...

26:46.105 --> 26:48.307
new people of the possible
girlfriend variety--

26:48.340 --> 26:50.376
they're the scariest

26:50.409 --> 26:51.978
people in the whole wide world.

26:52.011 --> 26:54.113
And distance keeps you safe?

26:55.782 --> 26:57.316
Knowing what I know now--

26:57.349 --> 26:59.385
separated, possible divorce--

26:59.418 --> 27:01.387
I'd still go
across the quad

27:01.420 --> 27:03.389
and ask a 19-year-old
Linda Walters

27:03.422 --> 27:05.658
to go see Creedence
at the Orpheum.

27:07.226 --> 27:08.327
I cracked the encryption

27:08.360 --> 27:09.996
on Drayer's computer.

27:10.029 --> 27:12.298
Chalk up another "V"
for Double P.

27:12.331 --> 27:14.366
Boy, this Drayer
was good.

27:14.400 --> 27:17.169
This guy designed
a cryptographic attack

27:17.203 --> 27:19.772
so that the output
of the infected cryptosystem

27:19.806 --> 27:22.408
could be computationally
indistinguishable
from the output

27:22.441 --> 27:25.077
of the corresponding
uninfected cryptosystem.

27:25.111 --> 27:27.079
Then he used
a asymmetric encryption

27:27.113 --> 27:29.248
to implement
the cryptographic back door.

27:29.281 --> 27:31.217
What do you mean by that?

27:31.250 --> 27:33.352
Which part?
All of it.

27:33.385 --> 27:35.421
The only thing you got to
understand is "back door."

27:35.454 --> 27:37.924
Which is what I said.
Yeah, except I'm
saying it in English.

27:37.957 --> 27:40.226
Guys...!
Drayer used
Maria Garcia

27:40.259 --> 27:42.394
as a way to get Bell
to talk all about himself.

27:42.428 --> 27:44.263
And in doing so,
and getting personal,

27:44.296 --> 27:46.265
Bell gave Drayer hints
that allowed Drayer

27:46.298 --> 27:47.834
to decipher
Bell's passwords.

27:47.867 --> 27:49.702
And with passwords
came the ability

27:49.736 --> 27:51.203
to put in this back door.

27:51.237 --> 27:54.340
So any communication that Bell
had with or for Admiral Hume...

27:54.373 --> 27:56.375
Marco Drayer had access to?

27:56.408 --> 27:58.210
Exactly.
Exactly.

27:58.244 --> 28:00.179
Really?
Really?

28:00.212 --> 28:04.016
I've been thinking
why Drayer was leaving
town in such a hurry.

28:04.050 --> 28:05.317
And clearly,
something spooked him

28:05.351 --> 28:07.186
between the first time
you encountered him

28:07.219 --> 28:08.354
and when he was shot.

28:08.387 --> 28:10.957
Which made me think
about his last meal.

28:10.990 --> 28:12.424
Contents of his stomach?

28:12.458 --> 28:15.427
Likely dinner the night before.

28:15.461 --> 28:17.063
Veal,

28:17.096 --> 28:18.865
crab cake, crawfish,

28:18.898 --> 28:21.768
brandy-infused Creole
tomato sauce.

28:22.935 --> 28:24.971
It's the specialty sampler plate

28:25.004 --> 28:27.306
at Arnaud's--
it's fantastic.

28:27.339 --> 28:29.375
You must have it.
If I'm Drayer,

28:29.408 --> 28:31.811
freaking out, worried
I'm a sitting duck, I am not...

28:31.844 --> 28:33.312
I am not...

28:33.345 --> 28:35.047
casually having a lovely meal

28:35.081 --> 28:37.483
in one of the city's
most elegant restaurants.

28:37.516 --> 28:41.087
Unless I'm there
for a purpose.

28:41.120 --> 28:43.756
PRIDE:
So, this is the security video

28:43.790 --> 28:45.291
from Arnaud's?
BRODY:
Yes.

28:45.324 --> 28:47.493
I went to the restaurant
and had a little chat

28:47.526 --> 28:49.461
with the maitre d'--
he remembers seeing Drayer,

28:49.495 --> 28:51.931
who went in without
a jacket, which is required,

28:51.964 --> 28:53.465
so they lent him one.

28:53.499 --> 28:55.835
Maitre d' said he had dinner
with this woman,

28:55.868 --> 28:57.436
who paid in cash.

28:57.469 --> 28:59.338
She look like
an assassin to you?

28:59.371 --> 29:01.941
PRIDE: Don't know.
Drayer sure seems agitated.

29:01.974 --> 29:04.310
But we'll let Bruce tell us.

29:04.343 --> 29:05.444
You, too, with the Bruce?

29:05.477 --> 29:07.013
When in Rome.

29:09.115 --> 29:11.417
Claudine Bouchard.

29:11.450 --> 29:12.418
Wanted for murder

29:12.451 --> 29:14.286
in Colombia.

29:14.320 --> 29:15.788
BRODY:
Suspected of killing

29:15.822 --> 29:16.989
heavily protected witnesses

29:17.023 --> 29:18.490
and five innocent bystanders.

29:18.524 --> 29:21.493
Collateral damage doesn't seem
to be an issue with her.

29:21.527 --> 29:25.264
Witness was supposed to testify
against the cartel.

29:25.297 --> 29:27.299
After that,
Claudine left Colombia,

29:27.333 --> 29:29.301
flew to Amsterdam,

29:29.335 --> 29:30.803
then vanished.

29:30.837 --> 29:32.872
Well, now she's un-vanished.

29:34.306 --> 29:36.508
So this
Claudine Bouchard...

29:36.542 --> 29:38.811
hires Drayer...

29:38.845 --> 29:41.213
to break into Bell's computer,

29:41.247 --> 29:44.150
steal some kind of information
about Admiral Hume.

29:44.183 --> 29:46.485
Once she gets it...

29:46.518 --> 29:49.455
She kills Bell, then Drayer--
both loose ends.

29:49.488 --> 29:53.192
If she did
what we're saying she did...

29:53.225 --> 29:56.328
God only knows
what mayhem's next.

29:56.362 --> 29:59.065
Hang on... Pride,
take a look at this.

30:02.869 --> 30:05.371
A woman in her line of work is
not going to use a credit card

30:05.404 --> 30:06.605
and leave a paper trail.

30:06.638 --> 30:09.008
So the card in her wallet...

30:09.041 --> 30:13.079
...I'm guessing is
a key card to her hotel room.

30:13.112 --> 30:15.414
Can't tell if
that's a "C" or a "G."

30:15.447 --> 30:18.985
You can search "blue card key"
or hotels

30:19.018 --> 30:21.387
that start
with "C"...
"C."

30:23.022 --> 30:26.358
Crescent Palms.

30:26.392 --> 30:27.493
Kind of place you check into

30:27.526 --> 30:29.061
when you don't want
to be noticed.

30:29.095 --> 30:30.062
Call Chris.

30:30.096 --> 30:31.597
Tell him to meet us.

30:42.909 --> 30:45.912
Room 207. Front desk
identified the photo.

30:45.945 --> 30:48.614
Said she went upstairs
about an hour ago,
hasn't been seen since.

30:48.647 --> 30:50.849
Bring the bag.

31:11.370 --> 31:13.539
NCIS!

31:22.614 --> 31:24.550
She's gone.

31:24.583 --> 31:26.418
Turn this place inside out.

31:35.962 --> 31:37.930
Got something here.

31:37.964 --> 31:39.198
Serial number's still on it.

31:39.231 --> 31:40.566
Guys...

31:45.271 --> 31:47.073
PRIDE:
Test it.

31:54.713 --> 31:56.949
Aluminum powder.

31:58.117 --> 32:00.719
With aluminum powder...

32:00.752 --> 32:03.389
and some kind
of a triggering device,

32:03.422 --> 32:05.224
all you'd need
is ammonium nitrate

32:05.257 --> 32:07.426
and you could make
the same kind of bomb

32:07.459 --> 32:10.262
that McVeigh used
in Oklahoma City.

32:10.296 --> 32:12.698
Where's Admiral Hume
and the security detail?

32:12.731 --> 32:14.733
He's hosting a dinner
at Arnaud's.

32:14.766 --> 32:16.002
For who?

32:16.035 --> 32:18.270
Admiral Fleetwood,
the head of SOCOM.

32:18.304 --> 32:19.505
Just the two admirals?

32:19.538 --> 32:20.706
Plus representatives

32:20.739 --> 32:22.441
from various
South American countries.

32:22.474 --> 32:23.642
They're forming a task force

32:23.675 --> 32:26.178
to stem the flow of drugs
into the States.

32:26.212 --> 32:27.579
You're saying
Bouchard hired Drayer

32:27.613 --> 32:29.248
to find out about
a dinner reservation?

32:29.281 --> 32:31.017
A highly classified
dinner reservation

32:31.050 --> 32:33.719
for a task force that's trying
to put the cartels

32:33.752 --> 32:35.654
out of business.
You think
Claudine Bouchard...

32:35.687 --> 32:40.726
Is gonna blow up that restaurant
and kill everyone inside.

32:50.169 --> 32:52.604
BRODY:
Need the bomb squad there
as soon as possible.

32:52.638 --> 32:55.174
Got to start blocking off
streets around the restaurant.

32:55.207 --> 32:57.076
Out of the way, out of the way!

32:57.109 --> 32:59.078
Come on, come on,
pick up the phone!

33:05.584 --> 33:08.087
I'm getting a recording saying
the phone is not in service.

33:08.120 --> 33:09.421
Same for security detail.

33:09.455 --> 33:10.689
I'll call the restaurant again.

33:14.560 --> 33:17.363
(tires squealing,
engine revving)

33:17.396 --> 33:19.765
I'll bet Claudine Bouchard
used her dinner with Drayer

33:19.798 --> 33:21.433
to do reconnaissance work

33:21.467 --> 33:23.435
in advance
of her assassination plan.

33:23.469 --> 33:25.304
Come on!

33:27.406 --> 33:29.508
Restaurant phones
are a recording.

33:29.541 --> 33:31.310
We're two blocks away.

33:34.846 --> 33:37.383
Clear the restaurant.
I'll take care of Hume.

33:39.785 --> 33:42.721
Ladies and gentlemen, if I can
have everyone's attention.

33:42.754 --> 33:44.556
We need you to calmly
rise from your tables,

33:44.590 --> 33:47.226
head in this direction
to this exit. Please, up.

33:48.694 --> 33:49.828
Admiral Hume.

33:49.861 --> 33:51.363
Agent Pride.

33:51.397 --> 33:52.731
We have an emergency situation.

33:52.764 --> 33:54.533
No time to waste.

33:54.566 --> 33:57.169
We need to get everyone out,
calmly and quickly.

33:58.737 --> 34:00.072
We need to go, sir.

34:00.106 --> 34:02.141
All right, gentlemen, let's go.

34:02.174 --> 34:05.311
This way.
Thank you, sir.

34:09.115 --> 34:10.782
Let's go.

34:30.736 --> 34:33.872
Bomb's by the kitchen near
the main gas shut-off valve.

34:33.905 --> 34:36.208
There's a mobile phone jammer.

34:36.242 --> 34:38.310
That's why our calls
couldn't get through.

34:38.344 --> 34:39.778
All right, finish clearing
the restaurant.

34:39.811 --> 34:41.413
Don't move anything.

34:42.448 --> 34:44.383
Keep moving. Let's go.

34:44.416 --> 34:46.785
Let's go.

34:46.818 --> 34:48.587
Let's go, Admiral.

34:48.620 --> 34:50.589
Anybody seen Chief
Petty Officer Martino?

34:50.622 --> 34:53.659
Clear the area,
clear the area safely.

34:53.692 --> 34:55.327
Quickly. Careful.
Clear the area.
Appreciate it.

34:55.361 --> 34:56.828
Thank you, men.

34:58.364 --> 34:59.731
That's it. It's clear.
You sure?

34:59.765 --> 35:01.500
Yes. Dishwasher
said he saw a lady

35:01.533 --> 35:03.802
with dark clothes and a hat
heading onto Dauphine.

35:03.835 --> 35:05.737
Claudine Bouchard.
Martino. Hey.

35:05.771 --> 35:07.673
Nobody's seen him.
Are you sure?

35:07.706 --> 35:09.808
He could still be in there.
I gotta go find him.

35:09.841 --> 35:12.244
I gotta go!
He's in there!
All right, but hurry!

35:13.612 --> 35:15.247
Okay...

35:15.281 --> 35:16.715
clear to the end of
the street, then lock it up.

35:16.748 --> 35:18.850
Pride, we got to find her

35:18.884 --> 35:21.187
before she's far enough away
to trigger the bomb.

35:21.220 --> 35:23.755
Go. Go. Talk to me!

35:23.789 --> 35:26.658
Phil!

35:30.762 --> 35:32.898
Phil!

35:40.539 --> 35:41.907
Pride, got her.

35:41.940 --> 35:43.775
She's headed west
on Bienville.

35:43.809 --> 35:45.344
Excuse me.

35:51.883 --> 35:53.519
NCIS!
Stop!

36:14.840 --> 36:16.875
Phil! Hey, we gotta go.

36:16.908 --> 36:19.745
You didn't hear the commotion?
French Quarter, man--
what the hell's going on?

36:19.778 --> 36:20.779
LASALLE:
Let's go!

36:25.851 --> 36:27.453
Don't move.

36:30.256 --> 36:30.956
Gun!

37:05.524 --> 37:07.326
So, how many medals

37:07.359 --> 37:08.794
they gonna give you
for those bandages?

37:08.827 --> 37:10.929
You should
check your phone.

37:10.962 --> 37:11.930
What?

37:11.963 --> 37:13.732
Check your phone.

37:23.475 --> 37:26.678
Thank you for the badge,
Agent Lasalle.

37:31.016 --> 37:32.484
Thank you, Chris.

37:32.518 --> 37:34.252
You would have done
the same for me.

37:35.654 --> 37:37.656
Probably.

37:38.790 --> 37:41.927
Hope's alive, brother.

37:43.895 --> 37:45.564
Thanks.

37:46.632 --> 37:48.367
Hey, guys.
Special Agent Pride,

37:48.400 --> 37:50.369
I would like to
introduce you to...

37:50.402 --> 37:51.903
Melissa.

37:51.937 --> 37:53.839
I've heard a lot
about you.
Likewise.

37:53.872 --> 37:55.874
And that's Agent Lasalle.

37:55.907 --> 37:56.942
Hey.
Hi.

37:56.975 --> 37:58.009
That's Agent Brody right there.

37:58.043 --> 37:59.945
Hi. Nice to meet you.

37:59.978 --> 38:01.913
That's some guy who
doesn't believe in yetis.

38:04.983 --> 38:06.852
It's the restaurant.

38:06.885 --> 38:08.620
Our dinner
reservations.

38:08.654 --> 38:10.589
Excuse me.

38:12.924 --> 38:14.960
What do you think?

38:17.596 --> 38:19.498
Terrified?
Oh, big-time.

38:19.531 --> 38:22.000
Then you're doing good.

38:24.803 --> 38:27.739
Mm! I gotta say,
she's not at all...

38:27.773 --> 38:29.475
What I expected.
I know.

38:29.508 --> 38:31.943
She's... pretty.

38:31.977 --> 38:33.512
She is.

38:33.545 --> 38:35.581
And she seems
really sweet.

38:35.614 --> 38:37.048
She does.

38:37.082 --> 38:38.684
PATTON: Man, I say
she kills him

38:38.717 --> 38:42.421
or empties out his bank account
within a week.

38:43.522 --> 38:44.990
Okay, two weeks.

38:46.157 --> 38:48.794
Okay, a month, tops.

39:13.952 --> 39:16.588
Where you at, brother?

39:40.446 --> 39:42.914
We're not open
till 7:00, hon.

39:42.948 --> 39:44.716
I'm not here to eat.

39:44.750 --> 39:46.618
I'm looking for someone;
think he works here.

39:46.652 --> 39:47.786
Cade Lasalle?

39:47.819 --> 39:48.920
Cade?

39:48.954 --> 39:51.590
God, I love that man.

39:51.623 --> 39:53.058
I gotta say,
if I didn't have a husband

39:53.091 --> 39:55.093
and two under a home,

39:55.126 --> 39:59.164
I would throw myself at him like
a schoolgirl on prom night.

40:00.131 --> 40:01.467
You a friend?

40:01.500 --> 40:02.968
Brother.

40:03.001 --> 40:05.837
Yeah, I see that now.

40:05.871 --> 40:07.573
You know when
he'll be in next?

40:07.606 --> 40:10.108
Oh, Cade up and left
end of summer,

40:10.141 --> 40:12.444
must be three
months now.

40:12.478 --> 40:14.513
He leave a forwarding address?

40:14.546 --> 40:16.948
He didn't even say good-bye.

40:18.684 --> 40:20.151
You know, he still has
a cashier's check

40:20.185 --> 40:22.988
in the back office-- I can
grab it, if you want.

40:23.021 --> 40:25.957
Sure.

40:28.694 --> 40:30.228
When you see him,

40:30.261 --> 40:33.832
you tell him little Lena
misses him, will you?
