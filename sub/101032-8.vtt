00:01.794 --> 00:03.171
Sorry I'm late. Sorry.

00:03.296 --> 00:04.797
Um, I...

00:04.923 --> 00:07.800
Linda sp-- I -- No, / spilled
coffee on my tie.

00:07.926 --> 00:11.763
Uh. ..[Chuckles]

00:11.888 --> 00:15.934
Linda got it special
for today, and...

00:16.059 --> 00:18.520
she got the stain out, too.

00:18.645 --> 00:21.189
I told her it wasn't worth it.

00:21.314 --> 00:23.733
My dad hated ties, probably make
fun of me for wearing it.

00:23.858 --> 00:26.528
But...
[lnhales deeply]

00:26.653 --> 00:28.404
...Larry McQueen's not here.

00:28.530 --> 00:31.616
[Laughing] So...

00:31.741 --> 00:34.536
-[Clears throat]
-[Man coughs]

00:34.661 --> 00:37.664
L...

00:37.789 --> 00:41.042
Larry McQueen did like whiskey,

00:41.167 --> 00:45.004
Jameson when he could afford it.

00:45.129 --> 00:48.049
Uh...the Stones, poetry.

00:48.174 --> 00:49.968
Actually, I think
the poetry was a secret.

00:50.093 --> 00:53.513
Like, I found, urn...

00:53.638 --> 00:56.641
He had all these notebooks
that he copied down

00:56.766 --> 00:59.060
other people's poems into 'em.

00:59.185 --> 01:02.522
And nice handwriting, too.
Very, you know...

01:02.647 --> 01:05.733
legible. [Chuckles]

01:05.858 --> 01:10.822
Uh, they were in this,
urn, box --

01:10.947 --> 01:12.323
all these notebooks --
under his bed.

01:12.448 --> 01:18.955
I found, um, you know,
Auden and Yeats, Thomas.

01:19.080 --> 01:20.498
Now, I don't know if he read 'em

01:20.623 --> 01:23.251
or if he just liked knowing
that they were there.

01:23.376 --> 01:26.337
But I was surprised
that the old man liked poems

01:26.462 --> 01:28.798
because he always gave me
so much shit

01:28.923 --> 01:30.758
about wanting to go to music s--

01:30.883 --> 01:34.387
music school.

01:34.512 --> 01:36.764
Sorry.

01:40.393 --> 01:43.563
I didn't really know him --
Larry.

01:43.688 --> 01:46.107
Urn...

01:46.232 --> 01:48.484
Yeah, he moved to this cabin
near Blanford

01:48.610 --> 01:51.946
when I was in high school.

01:52.071 --> 01:55.908
He said he was trying to be
a better person.

01:56.034 --> 01:58.661
That was a lie.
I mean...

01:58.786 --> 02:00.371
he was hiding.

02:00.496 --> 02:02.999
I mean, he pretty much hid
my whole life.

02:03.124 --> 02:05.418
In bars, mostly.

02:05.543 --> 02:06.711
Mm...

02:06.836 --> 02:09.505
[Chuckling] You know, even when
he was -- was home,

02:09.631 --> 02:11.883
he, uh...he was real quiet.

02:12.008 --> 02:14.135
Like he thought
maybe if he didn't say much,

02:14.260 --> 02:16.220
nobody would notice
that he was there.

02:16.346 --> 02:18.097
[Chuckles]

02:22.393 --> 02:25.355
My morn said that
he wasn't always like that,

02:25.480 --> 02:31.027
that before, uh, Vietnam,
he was...

02:32.945 --> 02:35.740
...funny.

02:35.865 --> 02:38.534
A guy with jokes.

02:39.535 --> 02:44.999
But, urn, he came back
on medical discharge

02:45.124 --> 02:47.835
all pissed off about everything
that he'd seen over there,

02:47.960 --> 02:52.674
and more pissed off about
nobody giving a shit over here.

02:52.799 --> 02:59.222
And that was before I was born,
so, you know...

02:59.347 --> 03:02.183
Wonder what it'd be like
to have a funny dad.

03:05.645 --> 03:07.313
Um...
[Clears throat] Okay.

03:07.438 --> 03:09.357
Urn...

03:09.482 --> 03:14.153
The first death I remember
was my hamster, Fluff.

03:14.278 --> 03:16.406
Uh, I let her out of her cage
one day,

03:16.531 --> 03:18.574
and she escaped
into the Ronco's backyard

03:18.700 --> 03:21.869
and Dickie Ronco shoved
this firecracker down her throat

03:21.994 --> 03:23.746
and blew her up.
[Scoffs]

03:23.871 --> 03:25.748
I was 9.

03:29.043 --> 03:34.549
My best friend, uh, was
a s-skinny kid called Bridges.

03:34.674 --> 03:36.050
Derrick Bridges.

03:36.175 --> 03:40.221
Uh, sick bass player.

03:40.346 --> 03:42.598
M-Maybe some of you guys
remember that rne and him,

03:42.724 --> 03:44.517
we had a band called Left Turn.

03:44.642 --> 03:46.144
- MAN: Yeah!
-[Chuckles]

03:46.269 --> 03:47.562
[Laughter]

03:49.355 --> 03:52.984
[Laughs] Uh, we used to
play out a little bit,

03:53.109 --> 03:54.527
mostly at the Cove.

03:54.652 --> 03:55.903
We toured a little bit.

03:56.028 --> 03:58.114
[Clicks tongue] Uh...

04:02.201 --> 04:06.080
Yeah, he was, like, the funniest
person that I ever knew.

04:06.205 --> 04:09.834
And. . .wild, you know?

04:11.711 --> 04:14.839
And we had a lot of fun

04:14.964 --> 04:19.135
just playing music
and touring and...

04:19.260 --> 04:22.680
Then the summer before
graduation,

04:22.805 --> 04:24.724
his grandma found him
in the basement.

04:24.849 --> 04:27.101
He'd OD'd.

04:37.111 --> 04:39.572
There's a lot of good folks
in this town.

04:39.697 --> 04:44.243
Urn, everybody was s-so nice
at his funeral.

04:44.368 --> 04:47.205
I mean, I couldn't think,
and I couldn't talk.

04:47.330 --> 04:49.081
[Laughing]
All I could do was, like,

04:49.207 --> 04:52.168
JUST hug people, you know?
Uh...

04:54.545 --> 04:57.590
And I always swore
that I'd never be like my dad.

04:57.715 --> 05:03.763
But then, after,
uh, Bridges died,

05:03.888 --> 05:05.932
I enrolled in
the Marine Corps because,

05:06.057 --> 05:09.519
l-l don't know,
like, I didn't...

05:09.644 --> 05:11.229
I didn't know what else to do.
I didn't...

05:11.354 --> 05:15.817
You know, I just like --
I had no money, I -- no band.

05:22.448 --> 05:26.661
You know, when I got back from
the Gulf, I finally realized

05:26.786 --> 05:30.832
why [scoffs] h-h-h-h-he --

05:30.957 --> 05:32.917
he was so pissed off
all the time, Larry,

05:33.042 --> 05:34.752
and why he drank
and why he hid --

05:34.877 --> 05:37.672
because he knew
there was no reason

05:37.797 --> 05:39.090
for him to have been born,

05:39.215 --> 05:43.928
and that nobody was gonna
give a shit when he died.

05:44.053 --> 05:46.848
And that made him feel helpless,
you know?

05:46.973 --> 05:50.476
And there's no worse feeling.

05:50.601 --> 05:53.938
So, yeah, Larry McQueen.

05:55.815 --> 05:57.191
Lived for nothing,

05:57.316 --> 06:00.361
[laughs] died for nothing,
saw a lot of death,

06:00.486 --> 06:05.241
and, I don't know, had me
somewhere along the way.

06:05.366 --> 06:08.703

Do you know who I am?

15:26.677 --> 15:29.638
Yeah.

15:29.763 --> 15:33.100
You're the FBI lady
who surprised rne at the church.

15:33.225 --> 15:35.727
We also spoke years ago.

15:35.853 --> 15:37.104
About Sharon Smith.

15:37.229 --> 15:38.897
My name's Agent Hutter.

15:39.022 --> 15:40.941
And you know Vic McQueen.

15:41.066 --> 15:43.735
L-l really need to talk
to Vic McQueen.

15:43.861 --> 15:46.280
I know about your time in juvie.

15:46.405 --> 15:49.324
From what I hear,
Victorville was pretty rough

15:49.450 --> 15:51.702
back in the day.

15:51.827 --> 15:54.163
Guarantee Framingham's worse.

15:54.288 --> 15:55.456
[sighs]

15:58.542 --> 16:02.171
If you want any chance
at leniency,

16:02.296 --> 16:05.174
you need to tell me
where to find Wayne McQueen.

16:09.428 --> 16:10.804
[Clears throat]

16:10.929 --> 16:15.809
You know, Bing, I, uh --
I recently screwed up at my job.

16:15.934 --> 16:20.647
My bosses are really mad at me.

16:20.772 --> 16:22.649
In fact, they're, uh...

16:22.774 --> 16:24.776
They're watching me right now.

16:28.155 --> 16:30.532
Have you ever had a boss
that was mad at you?

16:30.657 --> 16:32.868
[Sputters]

16:32.993 --> 16:35.162
Mr. Manx is always mad.

16:35.287 --> 16:37.206
I bet he didn't appreciate you.

16:40.709 --> 16:42.753
I wish I never met him.

16:46.548 --> 16:50.093
I wouldn't be sitting here.

16:50.219 --> 16:52.888
Vic McQueen would
still be my friend.

16:58.519 --> 17:03.315
You know, Bing, you and I
could help each other.

17:03.440 --> 17:05.983
In order to get back
in my bosses' good graces,

17:06.108 --> 17:09.070
I need information.

17:09.195 --> 17:12.741
If you can give me
that information,

17:12.866 --> 17:16.954
I could ask Vic to come in here
and talk to you.

17:18.664 --> 17:21.165
And you --
y-you'd tell her how --

17:21.290 --> 17:23.919
h-how honest and helpful I was?

17:25.546 --> 17:27.047
First, Mr. Partridge,

17:27.172 --> 17:31.468
you have to be
helpful and honest.

17:35.847 --> 17:38.183
[indistinct conversations]

17:38.308 --> 17:40.894
You need to ice that hand.

17:41.019 --> 17:42.229
I'm okay, Lin.

17:42.354 --> 17:44.856
[sighs]

17:48.527 --> 17:50.612
[Sighs]
I could use a drink.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.322
I know.

17:52.447 --> 17:54.616
I know.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.118
- Tabs.
- Hi.

17:56.243 --> 17:58.787
Uh, so, Bing confessed
to several crimes,

17:58.912 --> 18:00.706
including kidnapping Wayne.

18:00.831 --> 18:03.083
Unfortunately, he refuses
to give up any more information

18:03.208 --> 18:05.043
as to Wayne's whereabouts
until he talks to Vic.

18:05.168 --> 18:07.421
- Alone.
- CHRIS: That's a bad idea.

18:07.546 --> 18:09.172
[Sighs] If I'd have been
alone with him

18:09.298 --> 18:10.716
in the junkyard,
we wouldn't be here now.

18:10.841 --> 18:13.010
- I might even have my kid back.
- LINDA: No, your father's right.

18:13.135 --> 18:14.261
That psycho is dangerous.

18:14.386 --> 18:16.263
Myself and
Agents Surinam and Daltry

18:16.388 --> 18:17.389
are gonna be watching
from the observation room.

18:17.514 --> 18:18.348
Yeah, from a safe distance.

18:18.473 --> 18:19.766
- Ma, can you just --
- LOU: Hey.

18:19.891 --> 18:23.145
It's your decision, baby, okay?

18:23.270 --> 18:27.065
If you think this'll help
get him back, it's up to you.

18:27.190 --> 18:29.443
- Let's go.
-[Buzzer sounds]

18:32.487 --> 18:33.697

- Hey, hey, Vic, d-did --
-[Door closes]

18:35.699 --> 18:38.827
Did the FBI lady tell you
how helpful I was?

18:38.952 --> 18:41.538
She did.

18:41.663 --> 18:44.333
She also said you'd tell me
about Wayne.

18:44.458 --> 18:46.585
Yeah.

18:46.710 --> 18:48.462
Where is he, Bing?

18:48.587 --> 18:50.380
I'm -- I'm -- I'm s-- I'm sorry

18:50.505 --> 18:53.675
for bringing Mr. Manx
back to life.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.428
L-l wish I never put the engine
back in the Wraith.

19:01.808 --> 19:05.187
Wayne is your chance
to make up for it.

19:05.312 --> 19:07.272
Okay?

19:07.397 --> 19:09.691
L-l tried to save him.

19:09.816 --> 19:14.404
I really -- I really did.

19:14.529 --> 19:16.990
Then help rne save him now, Bing.

19:21.286 --> 19:24.331
Do you remember
when we were friends?

19:31.463 --> 19:33.674
We used to trade comics.

19:33.799 --> 19:36.927
- Mm.
- Yeah.

19:37.052 --> 19:40.889
I miss that.

19:41.014 --> 19:42.641
DO you?

19:46.061 --> 19:48.313
I miss the person
I thought you were.

19:54.861 --> 19:58.615
Urn, I don't have any friends.

20:00.575 --> 20:04.955
No one to visit me in prison.

20:05.080 --> 20:08.583
I'm all alone.

20:08.709 --> 20:10.669
It's super, super scary.

20:15.215 --> 20:18.051
I'm sorry for
all the bad things I did.

20:22.472 --> 20:25.976
I know you won't ever want
to be my friend again.

20:26.101 --> 20:28.603
I just wanted to ask
if you could make

20:28.729 --> 20:32.691
just a little space inside
your heart to forgive me.

20:50.292 --> 20:52.878
Bing.

20:53.003 --> 20:55.547
Tell me how to find Wayne.

21:00.927 --> 21:02.971
Yeah. Uh...They...

21:03.096 --> 21:07.434
B-Before they have
Christmas every day,

21:07.559 --> 21:11.605
each child must hang
their ornament in a tree.

21:14.149 --> 21:16.818
It's the last stop
before Christmasland.

21:16.943 --> 21:19.321
They have to get out
of the car to do it.

21:19.446 --> 21:21.281
[Chair scrapes]

21:21.406 --> 21:22.783
[Bangs on door]

21:22.908 --> 21:25.076
I helped.
Just like I said I would.

21:25.202 --> 21:27.120
VIC: Come on.

21:27.245 --> 21:29.164
Are you gonna forgive me?

[Buzzer sounds, latch clicks]

21:41.885 --> 21:44.137

Oh, thank God.
What did he say?

21:49.810 --> 21:51.436
I need your Tiles.

21:54.439 --> 21:58.443
DALTRY: Agent Hutter, come in.

21:58.568 --> 22:01.822
You got a full confession
from Bing Partridge.

22:01.947 --> 22:04.032
More than we expected.

22:04.157 --> 22:05.867
DALTRY: You knew exactly how
to work him.

22:05.992 --> 22:07.911
You even managed to prove
your relationship

22:08.036 --> 22:10.163
with Ms. McQueen
beneficial to the case.

22:10.288 --> 22:11.498
So, what happens next?

22:11.623 --> 22:13.875
We order a psych eval on Bing.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.502
The man's clearly delusional,

22:15.627 --> 22:18.839
talking about reincarnation
and Christmasland.

22:18.964 --> 22:20.006
And Wayne?

22:20.131 --> 22:26.930
Yeah, I'm curious
to hear your theory.

22:27.055 --> 22:28.598
I think he's in that junkyard.

22:28.723 --> 22:31.685
DALTRY: I agree.
Killed and buried by Partridge.

22:31.810 --> 22:35.063
Coordinate
with the area field office

22:35.188 --> 22:37.732
and start an official search
for the body.

22:37.858 --> 22:40.735
Oh, and, uh, you got
your badge back.

22:45.907 --> 22:47.075
Thank you.

if it weren't for my dad.

He cost us time.

22:57.836 --> 22:59.087
Well, parents always
let you down.

22:59.212 --> 23:03.216
That's why I don't talk to mine.

23:03.341 --> 23:06.094
Not you and Wayne.

23:06.219 --> 23:07.178
Vic, I'm serious.

- We all screw up sometimes.
- VIC: Mm.

hotel room without a plan.

for your mopey ass.

hung his ornament...
