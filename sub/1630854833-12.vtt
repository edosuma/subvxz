36:00.070 --> 36:02.421

It's OK.

36:05.989 --> 36:08.253
- Oh, my God.

36:11.256 --> 36:13.736

36:15.564 --> 36:17.610
What did you do?

36:17.653 --> 36:19.916
[dramatic music]

36:25.183 --> 36:26.880
- So you're
the Barry from 2023.

36:26.923 --> 36:28.838
And you are
the Cecile from 2023,

36:28.882 --> 36:30.579
but in our Cecile's body.

36:30.623 --> 36:32.929
- And here I thought today
couldn't get any freakier.

36:32.973 --> 36:35.236
- Look, the crystal
that possessed Nora,

36:35.280 --> 36:36.672
it attacked me in the past.

36:36.716 --> 36:38.848
And then it went
after the team in 2023.

36:38.892 --> 36:41.024
- Wait, why don't we
remember these attacks?

36:41.068 --> 36:42.722
- Because they're
happening simultaneously

36:42.765 --> 36:44.506
across the timeline.

36:44.550 --> 36:46.204
First in the past--

36:46.247 --> 36:49.598
- Then in your present.
- And now here, in 2049.

36:49.642 --> 36:52.906
All while charging the crystal
for the new avatar, Eddie.

36:52.949 --> 36:54.603
- That's not all.

36:54.647 --> 36:56.475
Speed Force Nora
showed up in 2023.

36:56.518 --> 36:58.085
She said
that she was under attack

36:58.128 --> 37:00.130
and that all that remains
of the Speed Force

37:00.174 --> 37:01.610
lives in your family.

37:01.654 --> 37:03.003
And then she vanished.

37:06.441 --> 37:07.747
Dad--

37:07.790 --> 37:09.270

37:09.314 --> 37:11.054
Explains why we can't
feel her anymore.

37:11.098 --> 37:13.709
- Sweet NK Jemisin.

37:13.753 --> 37:16.190
OK, all this red energy
that's appearing in the sky,

37:16.234 --> 37:17.844
it's not lightning.

37:17.887 --> 37:21.239
It's the timeline
starting to fracture.

37:21.282 --> 37:23.415
And it'll spread
in every direction--

37:23.458 --> 37:26.635
- Until there's nothing left
of the timeline at all.

37:26.679 --> 37:28.507
- How long do we have, Chuck?

37:28.550 --> 37:31.901
- I'm not sure, but at
this rate of degradation,

37:31.945 --> 37:34.121
not very long.

37:34.164 --> 37:36.254
- Cecile,
I still can't time travel.

37:36.297 --> 37:38.430
Can you warn
the team back in 2023?

37:38.473 --> 37:40.345
- Yeah, on it.

37:40.388 --> 37:43.130
But what do I tell
the team about Eddie?

37:43.173 --> 37:45.872
Is there a chance he rejected
that crystal's offer?

37:45.915 --> 37:48.701

like this in so long.

38:03.977 --> 38:05.631
It's weird.

Eddie is doing this.

38:20.123 --> 38:22.256
He seemed like his old self,

but then he started
going on about how

38:24.084 --> 38:25.868
