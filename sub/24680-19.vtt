00:00.835 --> 00:03.352
In New York City's war on crime,

00:03.352 --> 00:08.392
the worst criminal offenders are pursued
by the detectives of the Major Case Squad.

00:08.392 --> 00:10.190
These are their stories.

00:12.155 --> 00:15.479
One eighty-five, 190, 195.

00:15.479 --> 00:18.818
Oops. I'll be right back with the rest.

00:19.975 --> 00:21.715
Runnin' out of time, Chops.

00:21.715 --> 00:25.896
Hey, if he's breathin', we'll find him.
Don't even think about it.

00:26.717 --> 00:31.324
Sorry. Am I a bad accountant or what?

00:32.833 --> 00:35.464
See you next week, girlfriend.

00:35.751 --> 00:37.447
You put up with that crap?

00:39.005 --> 00:41.120
It's not forever.

00:41.905 --> 00:44.506
He's been in that apartment for a week.
He's going stir-crazy.

00:44.506 --> 00:47.294
It'd be a nice gesture,
considering what he's doing for us.

00:47.294 --> 00:49.815
I just need him to sit still for another week.

00:49.815 --> 00:52.979
If we don't get thrown another continuance.

00:59.413 --> 01:01.124
Here she comes.

01:01.336 --> 01:03.116
We go with her?

01:04.331 --> 01:07.093
No. Go buy a cake.

01:11.747 --> 01:14.648
So the big mystery's over.
Here's the address.

01:14.648 --> 01:16.351
No stops on the way there or back.

01:16.351 --> 01:18.051
Take him in and out through the back entrance.

01:18.051 --> 01:20.769
Inside, stay close.

01:22.061 --> 01:23.727
Here.

01:24.119 --> 01:26.606
So, what do you think?

01:27.157 --> 01:29.717
I think she's gonna be 
very proud of you, Danny.

01:42.510 --> 01:45.849
Danny, this is the best gift I could get.

01:45.849 --> 01:48.502
I didn't think you'd come 
back from Florida in time.

01:48.502 --> 01:51.000
Hey, anything for my nana.

01:57.533 --> 01:59.431
This guy's still at it?

01:59.431 --> 02:02.583
I'm gonna put his head in that 
squeeze box he doesn't shut up.

02:02.583 --> 02:05.789
Shut your mouth, punk.
I love that tune.

02:05.789 --> 02:07.928
Don't screw with me, old man.

02:07.928 --> 02:09.995
Or what?

02:10.268 --> 02:12.066
You sit down and drink your Shirley Temple.

02:12.066 --> 02:15.540
You sit down before I rip your 
finger off and shove it up your...

02:16.225 --> 02:17.702
Get down!

02:24.571 --> 02:26.298
Ma, you all right?

02:26.298 --> 02:29.614
Danny, did you...
Oh, my God.!

Law & Order CI 
3x19. Fico Di Capo

03:12.652 --> 03:15.293
ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON NBC:  2004/05/09

03:20.369 --> 03:24.015
This kid's a witness in a mob trial,
and you bring him here for Sunday dinner.

03:24.015 --> 03:25.400
Whose idea was that?

03:25.400 --> 03:26.720
Mine.

03:26.720 --> 03:28.478
Thank you, Officer Tait.

03:29.194 --> 03:31.750
Who knew Danny'd be here?
His family?

03:31.750 --> 03:33.637
No. They thought he was in Florida.

03:33.637 --> 03:35.998
Not even my own guys knew until tonight.

03:36.686 --> 03:38.955
Danny witnessed an arson of a meth lab?

03:38.955 --> 03:42.133
He was working across the street. 
He saw Mikey Damiano run from the building.

03:42.133 --> 03:44.622
We only found Danny 'cause 
our other witnesses recanted.

03:44.622 --> 03:46.891
Nobody knew we had him.

03:47.096 --> 03:49.812
If I knew who he was testifying against...

03:50.007 --> 03:53.267
Mario Damiano's kid, of all people...

03:53.414 --> 03:55.027
I never would've allowed that.

03:55.027 --> 03:56.813
We understand.

03:57.080 --> 03:59.442
Your son was brave, Ms. Lucci.

03:59.932 --> 04:01.996
We'll get justice for him.

04:03.142 --> 04:07.301
Danny Lucci's protection detail said 
the shooter was standing right about here.

04:07.301 --> 04:11.254
Male Caucasian, 50s, 60s,
gold-tinted glasses.

04:11.254 --> 04:13.207
It's Chianti.

04:15.823 --> 04:17.795
No one drank from this.

04:19.433 --> 04:23.975
Three shots, grouped together
to avoid hitting unintended victims.

04:23.975 --> 04:26.450
And enough boom-boom to make everybody duck.

04:26.450 --> 04:29.287
Next shot, on the money.

04:30.292 --> 04:32.861
He saved the last two rounds...

04:33.412 --> 04:36.050
in case he ran into trouble getting out.

04:36.628 --> 04:37.827
Old school pro.

04:37.827 --> 04:41.030
Working with someone from the new school.
The other guy: 19, 20,

04:41.030 --> 04:43.850
dark hair, leather coat,
collar turned up.

04:43.850 --> 04:44.790
I can't believe it, Jim.

04:44.790 --> 04:46.580
Your guys were supposed to sit on top of him.

04:46.580 --> 04:48.679
- Now we're in for it.
- This is a disaster.

04:48.679 --> 04:51.383
Mr. Perez, this is neither the time nor the place.

04:51.383 --> 04:55.299
Detective Farcas, the district attorney,
the police commissioner have agreed...

04:55.299 --> 04:57.665
Major Case will be investigating this murder.

04:57.665 --> 04:59.101
It's my case.

04:59.101 --> 05:02.010
You have your hands full 
with the Damiano arson case.

05:02.010 --> 05:05.602
Now, why don't you and Mr. Perez have a
word with the young man's parents.

05:05.602 --> 05:07.941
Come here.
I want to talk to you.

05:10.015 --> 05:13.492
This began as an argument 
over an accordion player?

05:13.492 --> 05:17.395
A diversion. It was a hit.
Probably ordered by the Damianos.

05:17.395 --> 05:20.226
And Damiano Senior is in a 
hospice dying from cancer.

05:20.226 --> 05:21.964
And his son Mikey?

05:21.964 --> 05:25.061
Somehow they knew Danny 
Lucci would be here tonight.

05:25.823 --> 05:27.838
It's such a nice cake.

05:30.176 --> 05:33.834
"Isabella's Italian Bakery." It's a special-order cake.

05:34.380 --> 05:38.568
They had to know in advance where to deliver it.

05:38.798 --> 05:40.844
ISABELLA'S ITALIAN BAKERY
39 RIDGE STREET
TUESDAY, MARCH 23

05:40.844 --> 05:44.185
Ms. Lucci came in Sunday 
afternoon to check on the decorations.

05:44.185 --> 05:46.788
This guy kneadin' the dough...
Is he new?

05:47.391 --> 05:50.622
He's not using enough flour.
The dough's gonna stick.

05:50.622 --> 05:51.859
Yeah, he's new.

05:51.859 --> 05:54.332
What happened to the guy he replaced?

05:54.478 --> 05:57.011
Roberto never came back
from his break yesterday afternoon.

05:57.011 --> 05:59.392
His break... It was after Mrs. Lucci was here?

05:59.392 --> 06:01.752
Yeah. He was in the alley talkin' to some guy.

06:01.752 --> 06:03.121
He came in and he went out again.

06:03.121 --> 06:06.358
- Why'd he come back in?
- He looked in that fridge.

06:06.642 --> 06:08.617
Is this where you kept Ms. Lucci's cake?

06:08.617 --> 06:10.034
In the box with the address?

06:10.034 --> 06:11.716
Yes.

06:12.370 --> 06:14.472
The guy in the alleyway...

06:14.654 --> 06:16.332
What did he look like?

06:16.545 --> 06:18.914
White guy. Young guy.

06:18.914 --> 06:20.993
I couldn't see his face real good.

06:20.993 --> 06:22.972
He had, you know, his collar up.

06:22.972 --> 06:25.424
It's all the rage these days.

06:26.189 --> 06:29.771
Here are the phone records for
the cops on Lucci's security detail.

06:29.771 --> 06:31.192
How're they stacking up?

06:31.192 --> 06:33.528
Mm, two of them are happily married.

06:33.528 --> 06:36.549
One of them... Tait... got slammed 
in his divorce last year.

06:36.549 --> 06:39.220
A wife and two teenage kids.

06:39.471 --> 06:41.844
A lot of cops manage 
alimony without taking bribes.

06:41.844 --> 06:45.063
Hey, the Damianos have
their hands in a lot of pockets.

06:45.063 --> 06:47.164
The great Damiano family.

06:47.299 --> 06:51.231
Old man Mario with lung cancer.
His brothers long gone.

06:51.231 --> 06:53.413
His eldest son dead.

06:53.796 --> 06:56.163
His middle son serving life.

06:57.006 --> 06:59.539
Now it's down to the runt of the litter.

07:00.709 --> 07:05.253
The officer with the alimony,
that's... Tait.  /  Yes.

07:08.971 --> 07:12.460
All right. His cell phone shows 
a half dozen calls yesterday...

07:12.460 --> 07:16.316
to and from a number in Cape May.

07:16.316 --> 07:21.563
- It's registered under a Karen Loeser.
- Yeah. That's his ex-wife.

07:21.817 --> 07:24.287
There's no calls to her last month,

07:25.255 --> 07:26.890
month before...

07:26.890 --> 07:28.213
two calls in nine weeks.

07:28.213 --> 07:30.817
Then all of a sudden she's his best pal.

07:32.308 --> 07:35.049
APARTMENT OF A.D.A. GERALDO PEREZ
BROOKLYN, NEW YORK
TUESDAY, MARCH 23

07:35.075 --> 07:37.093
A new dirt bike.

07:37.311 --> 07:39.566
That's what the calls were about.

07:39.737 --> 07:45.400
It was delivered to Tait's son the 
day after Danny Lucci was shot.

07:45.447 --> 07:49.135
His kid says that it was a 
surprise birthday gift from his dad.

07:49.135 --> 07:50.709
We're still tracking down the dealership,

07:50.709 --> 07:55.402
but there's no record of how Tait paid for it...
no check, no withdrawal from his bank.

07:55.402 --> 07:57.572
Son of a bitch.

07:58.101 --> 08:00.409
Sorry. Didn't know you had company.

08:00.409 --> 08:02.639
These are detectives from Major Case.

08:02.639 --> 08:04.051
This is my wife, Nina.

08:04.051 --> 08:07.472
We're just, uh, you know,
swapping fish stories.

08:07.613 --> 08:10.304
Take your time.
Nice to meet you.

08:10.676 --> 08:14.896
So Tait was in a position to tell Mikey Damiano...

08:14.896 --> 08:18.664
that Danny Lucci might be
at his grandmother's dinner.

08:18.664 --> 08:21.837
One of Detective Farcas's own men.

08:21.837 --> 08:23.590
Bring him in.

08:25.183 --> 08:28.408
Mikey handled everything like a real pro, Mr. Damiano.

08:28.408 --> 08:31.175
I always knew he was a chip off the old block.

08:34.989 --> 08:36.871
Good boy.

08:38.779 --> 08:41.595
Give me one of those figs.

08:50.223 --> 08:53.427
You don't tell Mikey about your visits here, okay?

08:53.427 --> 08:55.581
No, sir, Mr. Damiano.

08:55.905 --> 08:58.609
Mikey's the last of my sons.

08:58.609 --> 09:00.883
I see his flaws.

09:01.323 --> 09:03.075
But you...

09:03.317 --> 09:05.867
Maybe you're from outside the family,

09:05.867 --> 09:08.891
but you got the Damiano spirit.

09:08.891 --> 09:12.025
We all come from the same earth, Mr. Damiano.

09:12.344 --> 09:14.718
I see bad days ahead.

09:15.762 --> 09:18.948
We'll be nothing if we don't help each other.

09:23.394 --> 09:26.930
I did not give up information on Danny Lucci.

09:26.930 --> 09:29.975
Just out of curiosity, how much do 
you think that information would be worth?

09:29.975 --> 09:32.133
Fifty thousand? Forty?

09:32.133 --> 09:35.980
How about $6,542.22?

09:35.980 --> 09:37.435
How did you arrive at that number?

09:37.435 --> 09:39.360
It's the price of a new dirt bike.

09:39.360 --> 09:41.683
Gift wrapping not included.

09:41.683 --> 09:43.483
It was delivered to your ex-wife's house.

09:43.483 --> 09:46.643
An early birthday present for your son, Jason.

09:46.643 --> 09:47.560
I didn't buy that.

09:47.560 --> 09:49.153
Well, that's not what you told your son.

09:49.153 --> 09:52.001
He said that you bought him a new bike.

09:52.001 --> 09:55.894
Well, he thought I did...
Thinks I did.

09:55.894 --> 09:58.715
It was the first time he called 
you in five months, right?

09:58.715 --> 10:00.727
He was angry about the divorce?

10:00.860 --> 10:02.834
What do you expect? He's just a kid.

10:02.834 --> 10:07.468
Well, if he thought that you did something nice, 
that might turn things around, right, Raymond?

10:07.468 --> 10:11.098
I did not buy him that bike.

10:13.144 --> 10:15.393
You let him think you did.

10:17.909 --> 10:21.917
I know I should've reported it, but...

10:24.640 --> 10:26.726
Jason...

10:29.636 --> 10:32.575
You should've heard the kid.

10:35.127 --> 10:36.584
I'll need the DD-5's by tomorrow.

10:36.584 --> 10:39.786
I want to present to the grandjury
as soon as possible.

10:39.786 --> 10:42.701
Well, I'm not sure Tait was the leak.

10:42.701 --> 10:45.401
- You bought that sob story?
- I bought his affect.

10:45.631 --> 10:48.567
Well, I'm sorry, but that's not evidence. 
The motorcycle is.

10:48.567 --> 10:51.502
A witness is dead.
The sooner we indict that guy,

10:51.502 --> 10:55.247
the sooner we can make a murder 
case against Mikey Damiano.

10:56.612 --> 10:59.712
Now the shooting really starts.

11:05.398 --> 11:08.594
No question we screwed up.
We lost a witness.

11:08.594 --> 11:11.052
But not one of my guys is 
on the Damianos' payroll.

11:11.052 --> 11:13.958
Then they have nothing to fear from a grand jury.

11:14.376 --> 11:16.119
Don't sell me sunshine, counselor.

11:16.119 --> 11:19.640
Perez is well-intentioned,
but he's makin' enemies.

11:21.548 --> 11:24.748
Detectives Goren and 
Eames happen to agree with him.

11:24.748 --> 11:26.246
They think Tait was set up.

11:26.246 --> 11:27.723
And the motorcycle?

11:27.723 --> 11:30.619
Cash purchase from a dealership in Hoboken.

11:30.619 --> 11:32.912
Buyer was a male Caucasian,

11:32.912 --> 11:35.993
early 20s, black hair,

11:36.141 --> 11:38.410
just like Mikey Damiano.

11:38.649 --> 11:41.014
Can you turn that into probable 
cause for a search warrant?

11:41.014 --> 11:42.860
- I'll talk to a judge.
- Good enough.

11:43.209 --> 11:45.450
Any way to put the brakes on Perez?

11:45.450 --> 11:47.615
Your detectives bring me something,

11:47.615 --> 11:49.888
I'll try to cool him out.

11:50.913 --> 11:54.202
Wa-Wa-Wait. I don't want these 
guys messin' up my dad's stuff.

11:54.452 --> 11:55.440
I'll show 'em where my room is.

11:55.440 --> 11:57.876
They'll just follow the stench.

11:57.876 --> 12:00.262
What'd you do?
Give the maid the year off?

12:00.262 --> 12:01.839
It's just you livin' here, huh,

12:01.839 --> 12:04.396
since your dad went to the hospice.

12:04.396 --> 12:07.614
This place must've been something back in 
the day when your mother was still alive,

12:07.614 --> 12:08.848
your brothers still around.

12:08.848 --> 12:10.667
Don't-Don't talk about my family.

12:10.667 --> 12:12.844
You're the last of the Mohicans, Mikey.

12:12.971 --> 12:14.424
I don't have nothin' to say without my lawyer.

12:14.424 --> 12:17.374
Oh, that's just adorable. Probably
the first words your dad taught you.

12:17.374 --> 12:20.199
- The garage this way?
- You figure it out.

12:22.557 --> 12:25.894
You know, Mikey, you really 
dodged a bullet with this arson case.

12:25.894 --> 12:29.214
We keep trying to figure out 
how a guy like you pulled it off.

12:29.214 --> 12:31.069
Very clever of you...

12:31.069 --> 12:33.783
use a dirt bike to dirty up a cop.

12:33.901 --> 12:36.469
What dirt bike, huh?
Do you see a dirt bike anywhere?

12:36.469 --> 12:37.987
Is this your defense strategy?

12:37.987 --> 12:40.713
Convince us you're too dumb to have pulled it off?

12:40.713 --> 12:44.348
Watch out. You're gonna 
get dust all over your clothes.

12:44.470 --> 12:48.213
You know, you should take better care
of your dad's car for the resale value.

12:48.213 --> 12:50.128
I'm not sellin' his car.

12:50.128 --> 12:52.986
Well, I don't see you drivin' around in this boat.

12:53.621 --> 12:56.218
And your dad's not gonna ride in it anytime soon.

12:56.218 --> 12:57.975
My pops'll be back.

12:57.975 --> 12:59.881
He'll be back strong.

13:01.737 --> 13:04.327
You're in over your head,
aren't you, Mikey?

13:04.580 --> 13:06.142
No. I'm doin'just fine.

13:06.142 --> 13:09.179
Fine? You turned your father's house into a pigsty.

13:09.179 --> 13:11.546
You let his gambling operation slide.

13:11.682 --> 13:15.396
And, best of all, you turned 
an arson rap into murder one.

13:15.396 --> 13:18.721
Perez won't stop until he 
puts a hot shot in your arm.

13:19.737 --> 13:22.390
Perez. I'm not scared of Perez.

13:22.390 --> 13:24.271
You know, he likes fishin' so much?

13:24.271 --> 13:27.633
You tell him, he keeps tryin' to reel me in,
I'm gonna cram that hook down his throat.

13:27.633 --> 13:29.429
He likes fishing?

13:30.131 --> 13:32.060
How do you know?

13:34.417 --> 13:38.146
Look. I don't got nothin' to say
without my lawyer, all right?

13:39.151 --> 13:41.027
Perez had fly-fishing 
equipment in his apartment.

13:41.027 --> 13:43.303
I doubt Mikey just made a lucky guess.

13:43.303 --> 13:46.734
They did their homework on Tait.
They probably did the same on Perez.

13:46.734 --> 13:48.766
Does he have a history with the Damianos?

13:48.766 --> 13:50.395
No. This is his first mob case.

13:50.395 --> 13:54.066
Two weeks ago, somebody pulled Perez's 
marriage license from the county clerk's office.

13:54.066 --> 13:56.567
Then they pulled his wife's birth certificate.

13:56.567 --> 13:58.589
I don't like the sound of that.

13:59.436 --> 14:02.651
Well, last year, one of Perez's assault 
cases was reassigned to another prosecutor...

14:02.651 --> 14:06.360
- due to conflict of interest.
- What was the conflict?

14:06.360 --> 14:09.986
The arresting officer...
was Officer Nina Perez.

14:10.149 --> 14:12.435
His wife was a beat cop at the 3-8.

14:12.435 --> 14:15.283
Hate to think the Damianos got to her.

14:16.442 --> 14:18.137
Check her creds.

14:22.675 --> 14:25.483
Officer Nina Grotsky Perez.

14:25.642 --> 14:29.845
She was transferred out of the 
3-8 six months ago to the 7-1.

14:29.845 --> 14:33.575
She's not at the 7-1 anymore,
or anywhere else.

14:33.575 --> 14:35.727
She's not on leave.

14:35.857 --> 14:39.230
But she's still drawing a paycheck.

14:39.354 --> 14:40.743
What, she's off the radar?

14:40.743 --> 14:42.770
She's undercover.

14:43.418 --> 14:45.968
you have a good weekend?

14:46.526 --> 14:48.233
very good

14:48.233 --> 14:51.592
what about you? how was
your big date satruday?

14:51.592 --> 14:54.357
turned out not to be so big after all

15:04.227 --> 15:07.534
The duty sergeant at the 7-1 doesn't 
know what happened to Nina Perez.

15:07.534 --> 15:09.009
Narco and Vice have never heard of her.

15:09.009 --> 15:10.742
If she's undercover, it's not with them.

15:10.742 --> 15:15.236
Whoever pulled her birth certificate 
could've followed the same trail that we did...

15:15.282 --> 15:17.116
and come to the same place.

15:19.131 --> 15:22.271
Deakins. Hold on.

15:22.493 --> 15:23.539
It's a reporter at the Ledger.

15:23.539 --> 15:26.634
He says he got our number 
from your friends at the 7-1.

15:26.634 --> 15:28.168
Put him through.

15:28.281 --> 15:29.891
Yes, Mr. Nossak?

15:30.753 --> 15:32.640
Right. About Nina Perez.

15:33.145 --> 15:34.667
No kidding?

15:35.526 --> 15:37.449
Well, I can't comment till I see it.

15:37.449 --> 15:39.565
Can you fax it? Have you got the number?

15:39.565 --> 15:40.510
Right.

15:41.524 --> 15:42.920
You won't believe this.

15:42.920 --> 15:47.058
Nossak's running a column on A.D.A. 
Perez in tomorrow morning's paper.

15:48.549 --> 15:51.580
"A.D.A. Perez's prosecution of 
Officer Tait has surprised many,

15:51.580 --> 15:54.942
"not the least of whom must be 
Perez's wife, Nina, a police officer...

15:54.942 --> 15:57.840
"who sources say is 
currently working undercover...

15:57.840 --> 16:00.977
in a heating oil company 
controlled by the Russian mob."

16:00.977 --> 16:03.194
They're blowing her cover.

16:03.595 --> 16:06.868
Well, if the reporter knows,
we have to assume everyone does.

16:07.211 --> 16:10.288
Captain Deakins for the chief of detectives.
It's urgent.

16:10.423 --> 16:12.006
They caught her just as she got home.

16:12.006 --> 16:13.000
Three puncture wounds.

16:13.000 --> 16:14.547
If you hadn't alerted us,
we'd have gotten here too late.

16:14.547 --> 16:15.897
This is her decoy apartment?

16:15.897 --> 16:18.938
Right. She'd come home,
change into her running sweats,

16:18.938 --> 16:22.290
take the stairs up three 
floors to her husband's place.

16:24.351 --> 16:27.166
How many in your unit knew her identity?

16:27.166 --> 16:29.027
Four, including me.

16:29.027 --> 16:31.565
And two more at the chief of D's office.

16:31.565 --> 16:33.288
Nina? Nina? Oh, my God.

16:33.288 --> 16:35.671
Baby, can you hear me?
What have they done to you?

16:35.671 --> 16:37.292
They got her stabilized, Mr. Perez.

16:37.292 --> 16:39.786
Listen. I know who did this.
I know who leaked her cover.

16:39.786 --> 16:41.567
It was cops to get back at me.

16:41.567 --> 16:45.442
This is the same thing as murder.
The same thing as murder!

16:46.274 --> 16:48.407
I don't know about all that,

16:48.681 --> 16:50.680
but I can tell you who tried to kill her.

16:50.680 --> 16:52.254
The Russians.

16:53.588 --> 16:56.598
If the Russians wanted her dead,
she'd be dead.

16:59.651 --> 17:03.335
I can't believe a cop would 
blow Nina Perez's cover.

17:03.459 --> 17:06.949
Perez believes it.
So do a number of my colleagues.

17:06.949 --> 17:10.075
We better get ahead of this 
before it turns into a war.

17:10.075 --> 17:13.694
A war would play into the hands of 
the people who tipped off the reporter.

17:13.694 --> 17:15.598
The same people who attacked Nina Perez.

17:15.598 --> 17:16.934
The Russians?

17:16.934 --> 17:18.300
She was no threat to them.

17:18.300 --> 17:22.025
Her supervisor said the Russians hadn't
taken her into their confidences yet.

17:22.025 --> 17:23.887
This attack wasn't about silencing her.

17:23.887 --> 17:27.478
She was knocked unconscious.
Each knife strike was precise.

17:27.478 --> 17:31.280
He hit no major organs, no arteries.

17:31.442 --> 17:32.988
He let her live.

17:32.988 --> 17:35.770
This was a display of power.

17:35.770 --> 17:38.138
And so is orchestrating a war.

17:38.252 --> 17:42.603
A single individual pitted the 
police against the D.A.'s office.

17:42.745 --> 17:45.863
Only the Damianos benefit from this,
and I don't see Mikey pulling it off.

17:45.863 --> 17:47.130
Maybe his old man.

17:47.130 --> 17:49.165
His phone at the hospice is tapped.

17:49.165 --> 17:50.709
His visitors monitored.

17:50.709 --> 17:53.188
Mikey visits once a month. That's it.

17:53.188 --> 17:56.294
Everybody else is in the pen or dead.

17:56.566 --> 17:58.740
Well, a ghost didn't do this.

18:01.059 --> 18:03.208
FOREST HILLS HOSPICE 
QUEENS, NEW YORK
WEDNESDAY, MARCH31

18:03.208 --> 18:05.127
What are you violatin' a dyin'old man for?

18:05.127 --> 18:07.322
Don't you have enough problems in your own family?

18:07.322 --> 18:09.560
That young broad gettin' cut.

18:09.560 --> 18:11.266
You heard about that?

18:11.563 --> 18:13.313
Who do you think did it?

18:13.893 --> 18:17.483
The Russians. They're animals.

18:18.799 --> 18:22.873
And who else would be so dumb?

18:23.118 --> 18:25.879
Right. Goin' after a prosecutor's wife.

18:26.724 --> 18:28.920
It's bad for business.
That's what you mean?

18:28.920 --> 18:31.382
So I hear. Those are private!

18:31.547 --> 18:35.337
It's just about the only pleasure left for an old man.

18:35.337 --> 18:37.091
Who brings you these?

18:38.753 --> 18:42.562
Sicilian blacks. Fico di capo.

18:43.263 --> 18:45.637
Fig of the don.

18:45.637 --> 18:48.921
- Mikey bring them?
- Yeah, Mikey.

18:49.073 --> 18:51.376
Oh, that's a nice gesture.

18:52.135 --> 18:54.851
It's too bad he's not as considerate with your home.

18:54.851 --> 18:56.754
Mm. It's like a frat house on a Sunday morning.

18:56.754 --> 18:59.125
He never even bothers to wash your car.

18:59.125 --> 19:03.197
Yeah, Mikey thinks that this is your last stop.

19:04.130 --> 19:07.863
Where in the hell you been?
I've been buzzin'for an hour.!

19:08.063 --> 19:10.948
Sorry, Mr. Damiano, sir.

19:11.573 --> 19:13.760
Hey, you. Give me that.

19:17.422 --> 19:20.521
You lay off my boy.

19:20.658 --> 19:23.148
He's gonna be an orphan soon.

19:32.233 --> 19:35.245
Mikey hasn't been here in two weeks.

19:37.417 --> 19:39.928
These figs are fresh.

19:44.788 --> 19:48.702
Why don't you just tell us who 
brought 'em to you, Mr. Damiano?

19:51.800 --> 19:55.030
It's somebody that you don't want us to know about.

19:55.030 --> 19:56.727
Right?

19:58.414 --> 20:01.286
Somebody who sneaks in like a thief.

20:05.812 --> 20:08.005
Move.

20:11.070 --> 20:13.985
He didn't look happy about
the attack on Perez's wife.

20:13.985 --> 20:16.856
He seems to be happy enough about the figs,

20:16.856 --> 20:19.590
however they're getting in there.

20:29.397 --> 20:32.782
Our fig man must have a friend on the inside.

20:45.337 --> 20:47.087
Do you need help?

20:47.087 --> 20:48.523
Yeah.

20:48.523 --> 20:51.014
That door over there...
The alarm is disconnected.

20:51.014 --> 20:53.098
Uh, uh...

20:57.116 --> 20:58.185
What?

20:58.185 --> 21:00.727
Pupils the size of pinholes,
an orderly's salary.

21:00.727 --> 21:02.419
I'm guessing methamphetamine.

21:02.419 --> 21:04.283
Let-Let's go with that.

21:04.283 --> 21:07.157
You know, seeing as you're 
the soldier on duty all night here,

21:07.157 --> 21:10.190
who brings Mr. Damiano the figs?

21:10.190 --> 21:12.127
Green Jell-O, stewed prunes,
I'm your guy.

21:12.127 --> 21:15.070
But figs? No. Sorry. L...

21:15.070 --> 21:16.130
If we checked that alarm box,

21:16.130 --> 21:19.509
whose fingerprints do you think we'd find?

21:23.385 --> 21:26.643
You cannot tell him that I told you this.

21:26.643 --> 21:28.027
He would take me apart.

21:28.027 --> 21:29.345
Tell who? Damiano?

21:29.345 --> 21:31.814
Not him. This kid, Chops.

21:31.814 --> 21:35.793
If I don't open the door for him,
he said he'd kill me.

21:35.977 --> 21:38.016
And you believe him, this kid?

21:38.016 --> 21:41.184
He deals meth to the regulars down 
at the bathhouses in the Village.

21:41.184 --> 21:45.010
My friends have seen what he
does to people who rip him off.

21:49.176 --> 21:51.588
Uh, excuse me, Chops.

21:51.718 --> 21:55.358
Hey, hey, the boys say that you're 
the guy to see if you need a boost.

21:55.358 --> 21:56.849
Do I know you?

21:56.849 --> 21:59.951
No. I just moved down here from Boston.
You know, I'm still makin' new friends.

21:59.951 --> 22:03.203
Boston P.D.
You're a cop, right?

22:03.203 --> 22:05.753
And her, your little friend?

22:05.992 --> 22:07.690
He made us.

22:08.269 --> 22:11.312
Wasn't that the point?
Have the little punk make us.

22:11.312 --> 22:13.743
- Maybe he'll get cocky, drop his guard.
- Come on. Come on.

22:13.743 --> 22:15.430
What do you wanna do now, officers?

22:15.430 --> 22:17.423
A stop-and-frisk? Be my guest.

22:17.423 --> 22:19.690
Hey, that was a preemptive offer.

22:19.690 --> 22:21.596
You know, so we think he's clean; 
we don't wanna search him.

22:21.596 --> 22:24.927
- Turn out your pockets.
- Whatever you want, officers.

22:26.336 --> 22:29.636
I guess we could go at it all day, huh, Chops?

22:29.636 --> 22:31.663
Trying to outsmart each other.

22:31.812 --> 22:34.163
You do good business selling meth.

22:34.163 --> 22:35.998
I don't do that.

22:36.143 --> 22:38.983
There's another reason why you're 
so popular in a bathhouse.

22:38.983 --> 22:41.739
Something to do with your nickname..."Chops"?

22:41.739 --> 22:44.867
Yeah. Yeah, that must be it.

22:45.191 --> 22:49.159
Is that how you met Mikey Damiano? In the sauna?

22:49.159 --> 22:51.735
I don't know a Mikey Damiano.

22:53.111 --> 22:55.202
That blank look on your face...

22:55.202 --> 22:59.056
When-When-When you got that look, 
what are you thinkin'?

22:59.383 --> 23:02.210
Nothin'. / I don't see any I.D. Here.
You got a name?

23:02.210 --> 23:05.127
You know my name. It's Chops.

23:05.254 --> 23:09.560
Well, he wanted a stop-and-frisk.
See, this is where it gets frisky.

23:12.804 --> 23:14.351
So you say you don't know Mikey, right?

23:14.351 --> 23:17.299
Yet you sneak in and visit 
his father four times a week.

23:17.299 --> 23:20.204
Oh, so now my imaginary 
friend has an imaginary father.

23:20.204 --> 23:23.137
Why are you makin' a fist? Huh?

23:23.895 --> 23:27.184
So when you bring the 
old man figs, they any good?

23:27.184 --> 23:28.732
Look. I'm a delivery boy, all right?

23:28.732 --> 23:30.695
That's what I do. But I'm nothin', all right?

23:30.695 --> 23:32.744
He's clean.

23:33.870 --> 23:35.853
You okay, Chops?

23:35.853 --> 23:37.587
Am I free to go, officer?

23:37.587 --> 23:39.367
You're free to go.

23:40.075 --> 23:42.119
Give me your rag.

23:50.004 --> 23:52.038
That a snake on your neck?

23:52.038 --> 23:56.763
My mother always told me to keep my paws
to myself, so I wouldn't leave smudges.

24:00.424 --> 24:03.436
We got deliveries to make, officer.

24:08.711 --> 24:13.146
We almost got a nice set of his prints off the window.

24:13.273 --> 24:17.291
I got partials on these when I uncurled his fingers.

24:18.108 --> 24:20.196
We have Richard Chops Cozza.

24:20.196 --> 24:23.451
"Chops" is actually on his birth certificate.

24:23.617 --> 24:26.460
One arrest for possession of stolen goods.

24:26.460 --> 24:29.089
Two chalices from a church.

24:29.205 --> 24:31.879
Maybe he is just Mario Damiano's delivery boy.

24:31.879 --> 24:36.616
A delivery boy that Damiano lied about,
who sneaks in like a thief.

24:36.616 --> 24:38.130
He's smart.

24:38.247 --> 24:41.588
We gave him plenty of provocation,
but he never took the bait.

24:41.588 --> 24:43.367
He felt anger.

24:43.367 --> 24:45.846
He just knew better than to show it.

24:45.846 --> 24:51.804
And instead, he went blank, like he was 
flipping through an emotional Rolodex,

24:51.804 --> 24:56.340
searching for the socially 
appropriate response.

24:56.340 --> 25:00.490
But anger, that is his only
true emotional response.

25:00.490 --> 25:03.283
For a guy with only one arrest,
he's got quite a file.

25:03.283 --> 25:09.216
His mother voluntarily terminated
her parental rights when he was an infant.

25:09.358 --> 25:11.238
He was adopted by his maternal uncle.

25:11.238 --> 25:13.848
Mm, another hard luck story.

25:13.848 --> 25:17.513
Grew up in Mikey Damiano's 
neighborhood until he was nine.

25:17.627 --> 25:19.700
Then he went to a group home in Staten Island.

25:19.700 --> 25:21.742
Wore out his welcome at his uncle's?

25:21.742 --> 25:23.510
Uncle Eddie.

25:24.144 --> 25:27.219
He was sent up for first-degree assault.

25:27.379 --> 25:30.892
Now he'd be about 60,
the same age as the Lucci shooter.

25:32.637 --> 25:34.338
Look him up.

25:34.561 --> 25:36.653
HOME OF EDDID COZZA
NEW ROCHELLE, NEW YORK
MONDAY, APRIL 5

25:36.653 --> 25:38.986
His car's still here.

25:39.112 --> 25:41.564
Eddie ever mention his nephew?

25:41.564 --> 25:43.893
Chops? All the time.

25:43.893 --> 25:46.419
Eddie loves that kid like he was his own.

26:08.838 --> 26:12.517
Uncle Eddie.
You help your nephew kill a witness,

26:12.517 --> 26:15.975
and this is the thanks you get?

26:16.380 --> 26:19.686
Who's there? Who is it?

26:20.489 --> 26:24.543
You shouldn't come around.
The cops are all over me.

26:26.596 --> 26:28.985
I brought you the newspaper.

26:30.018 --> 26:31.727
Things are getting tough on the streets.

26:31.727 --> 26:33.618
The other families are blaming us.

26:33.618 --> 26:37.913
That cop broad... You didn't have 
nothin' to do with cuttin' her, did you?

26:39.126 --> 26:42.049
It was Mikey, Mr. Damiano.
I would've stopped him if I knew.

26:42.049 --> 26:44.569
That stupid...

26:45.638 --> 26:47.732
This is the end, Rickie.

26:47.732 --> 26:50.097
The other families are gonna finish us off.

26:50.097 --> 26:52.294
That won't happen.
I'll protect Mikey.

26:52.294 --> 26:56.360
The Damiano family will be a great family again.

26:56.503 --> 26:59.604
It's gonna take blood, Rickie.

27:00.649 --> 27:03.936
You have to do somethin' for me.

27:03.936 --> 27:07.935
The last thing I'll ever ask you.

27:14.477 --> 27:17.861
Two stab wounds to the chest.
The killer left nothing at the scene.

27:17.861 --> 27:20.208
Except another display of power.

27:20.208 --> 27:24.535
The precise knife work...
two thrusts under the rib cage, into the heart.

27:24.535 --> 27:27.540
And then, he left these where 
we would see them, to mock us.

27:27.540 --> 27:30.722
Rickie would've been staring his uncle 
right in the face when he killed him.

27:30.722 --> 27:32.667
Kid knows how to reward loyalty.

27:32.667 --> 27:34.566
The question is, who's the loyalty to?

27:34.566 --> 27:36.926
Mario Damiano? Mikey?

27:37.091 --> 27:39.374
Whatever brings him closer to his goal.

27:39.374 --> 27:43.265
He grew up in the Damiano neighborhood 
before they shipped him off to Staten Island.

27:43.265 --> 27:46.386
Now, he might be trying to earn 
what naturally would have been his:

27:46.386 --> 27:48.616
A membership in the Damiano family.

27:48.616 --> 27:50.767
A family on its last legs.

27:51.728 --> 27:54.320
We're going to see about
passing around the peace pipe.

27:54.320 --> 27:57.650
Anything you'd like to 
share about your next move?

27:57.650 --> 28:00.621
Uncle Eddie's sister, Rickie's mother,

28:00.621 --> 28:02.663
she still lives in the old neighborhood.

28:02.663 --> 28:07.522
Now, Eddie might have told her 
about the work he was doing for her son.

28:09.298 --> 28:11.164
HOME OF GINA RIGATELLO
QUEENS, NEW YORK
TUESDAY, APRIL 6

28:11.164 --> 28:14.080
I haven't talked to my brother]
since he got out of prison.

28:14.192 --> 28:18.008
If you don't mind, I got kids.
They're comin' home. I have to make dinner.

28:18.008 --> 28:21.307
Your kids... You include Rickie?

28:21.464 --> 28:23.840
Chops is my kid on a technicality only.

28:23.840 --> 28:26.526
I got two boys. Good boys.
They're both in school.

28:26.526 --> 28:28.957
Ms. Rigatello, we found your 
brother a couple days ago...

28:28.957 --> 28:31.114
in his house, stabbed to death.

28:31.114 --> 28:32.428
We think Rickie did it.

28:32.428 --> 28:35.422
My brother died the way he lived.

28:35.563 --> 28:39.746
We noticed that "Chops" is one of Rickie's given names.

28:39.860 --> 28:41.733
Was that your husband's idea?

28:41.733 --> 28:43.962
I wasn't married when I had him.

28:44.778 --> 28:47.457
Um, it was your idea?

28:47.598 --> 28:52.301
Something to do with, um, the way 
the baby looked when he was born?

28:52.412 --> 28:55.992
The boy was born with a full set of teeth in his head.

28:55.992 --> 28:58.498
Teeth! Can you imagine?

28:58.498 --> 29:00.850
They're called natal teeth.
They're rare, but...

29:00.850 --> 29:04.002
Call 'em what you want, it's...
it's unnatural.

29:04.002 --> 29:08.090
So that's why you...
you put him up for adoption?

29:08.210 --> 29:10.038
Because he was ugly?

29:10.799 --> 29:12.847
Did something happen?

29:13.660 --> 29:16.140
He bit you when you nursed him?

29:16.140 --> 29:19.760
The day I had him, he bit me.
He's a monster.

29:19.760 --> 29:23.213
I used to see him hangin' around,
bullyin' all the smaller kids,

29:23.213 --> 29:26.004
telling them that he was the 
king of the neighborhood.

29:26.004 --> 29:29.855
Then their older brothers used to come 
out and beat the living crap out ofhim.

29:29.855 --> 29:31.847
And I used to think,

29:31.982 --> 29:34.910
"Thank God he ain't my kid no more."

29:35.526 --> 29:37.949
That basement window...

29:37.949 --> 29:42.827
Did someone, uh, go down 
into the window well recently?

29:43.396 --> 29:46.381
Because the-the grate...

29:46.381 --> 29:51.434
Covering the well... has been moved.

29:52.153 --> 29:55.343
Uh, do you mind if we look in your basement?

29:55.343 --> 29:57.399
Be my guest.

29:57.683 --> 30:00.598
This key ring...
Does it usually have a key on it?

30:00.598 --> 30:04.619
It's an extra house key.
One of my kids must've took it.

30:05.446 --> 30:08.659
Do you notice anything missing from your house?

30:09.714 --> 30:11.995
Or out of place here?

30:12.344 --> 30:13.807
No.

30:19.366 --> 30:24.281
Do you think you could go upstairs 
and see if you can find that extra house key?

30:24.281 --> 30:26.631
All right.

30:29.557 --> 30:33.240
The other boxes are taped shut,
but not this one.

30:38.993 --> 30:41.577
Rickie's been here.

30:42.134 --> 30:47.224
Broke in, stashed this,
stole the extra key...

30:47.224 --> 30:49.528
so he could get back in.

30:50.378 --> 30:51.660
He's coming back to kill someone.

30:51.660 --> 30:54.050
Oh, I can think of one candidate.

30:54.050 --> 30:59.274
Well, killing his mother is not gonna 
make him king of the neighborhood.

30:59.536 --> 31:04.585
But everything he's done has 
brought him closer to the seat of power.

31:05.062 --> 31:07.544
There's only one obstacle left.

31:08.172 --> 31:11.385
I don't know this kid Rickie Chops.

31:11.385 --> 31:15.324
These figs... I just open my eyes,
and there they are.

31:15.324 --> 31:18.402
Well, you better open your eyes a little wider, 
because he's setting your son up.

31:18.402 --> 31:21.033
Oh, you don't know what you're talkin' about.

31:21.033 --> 31:23.278
He doesn't care about Mikey.

31:23.422 --> 31:26.660
He killed that witness to grab your attention,

31:26.660 --> 31:29.058
but he let Mikey take credit for it...

31:29.058 --> 31:33.123
and for stabbing the undercover 
cop and starting a war.

31:34.060 --> 31:36.668
Now the heat's on,

31:37.516 --> 31:39.699
he's gonna kill Mikey.

31:40.456 --> 31:43.621
He's gonna blame it on the other families.

31:43.621 --> 31:45.681
And when you seek revenge,

31:45.681 --> 31:47.784
you'll turn to him.

31:48.987 --> 31:51.916
And he'll take all the power you have left.

31:52.600 --> 31:55.887
And you'll put it in his hands,
and that's what he's after.

31:56.302 --> 32:00.200
Why are you tellin' me this?
You think I'm gonna help you?

32:02.824 --> 32:07.290
We're not telling you anything 
you don't know already. Are we?

32:12.153 --> 32:15.636
You already gave him the okay to kill Mikey.

32:19.674 --> 32:23.067
This kid you talk about...

32:23.423 --> 32:29.063
He terrifies me more than this cancer inside me, but...

32:29.959 --> 32:32.710
I'm gonna give him what he wants.

32:32.710 --> 32:38.491
As I leave this world,
I unleash him on yours.

32:41.423 --> 32:44.345
Have you thought of talking to Mikey Damiano?

32:44.345 --> 32:46.447
Once he knows there's a knife aimed at his jugular,

32:46.447 --> 32:49.203
he might decide to turn on his friend.

32:49.203 --> 32:51.652
Assuming he was careless enough to say something.

32:51.652 --> 32:57.327
Well, maybe... maybe Rickie is the one to turn.

32:58.682 --> 33:03.119
You know, kids like him...abandoned kids... 
sometimes their weakness is loyalty.

33:03.119 --> 33:06.494
You know, they don't give it,
but they expect it.

33:06.494 --> 33:10.482
When they don't get it,
they lose control.

33:11.472 --> 33:12.830
What are you looking for?

33:12.830 --> 33:14.900
A fig salesman.

33:22.143 --> 33:25.402
Mornin'. We were just admirin' your car, Louis.

33:25.402 --> 33:28.034
Especially the way it's parked so far from the curb.

33:28.034 --> 33:30.283
Let's see your registration.

33:31.820 --> 33:35.488
Don't think we don't know that look.
You think we're harassing you, right?

33:35.488 --> 33:37.685
And then we're gonna need 
to see your driver's license.

33:37.685 --> 33:40.469
In fact, why don't you empty 
your pockets right here.

33:40.469 --> 33:42.498
But we're not harassing you, you know?

33:42.498 --> 33:46.920
We're just giving you a heads-up.
We don't want you to end up like... Uncle Eddie.

33:46.920 --> 33:50.900
People at the restaurant 
remember his big goofy glasses.

33:51.055 --> 33:53.291
That's why Chops got rid of him.

33:53.990 --> 33:59.906
We don't want people to start 
remembering that snake on your neck.

34:00.752 --> 34:03.875
Sooner or later, we're gonna 
come knocking on your door, Louis.

34:03.875 --> 34:07.123
You better hope that we get there before Chops does.

34:13.159 --> 34:14.404
You workin' on a problem?

34:14.404 --> 34:16.712
Me? No, Chops. Everything's cool.

34:16.712 --> 34:19.817
Today's it, man.
Don't screw it up.

34:20.217 --> 34:22.194
Okay. Let's go.

34:22.453 --> 34:24.963
My pops has really been wantin' to meet you, Rickie.

34:24.963 --> 34:26.942
I told him what a good friend you been to me.

34:26.942 --> 34:28.885
This is a big day for me, Mikey.

34:28.885 --> 34:30.663
Meeting your father.

34:30.663 --> 34:34.223
Hey, I wanna get somethin' 
special for your dad at my mom's house.

34:34.223 --> 34:35.728
It-It's on the way.

34:35.728 --> 34:38.380
Yeah. Sure. Whatever. Come on.

34:50.822 --> 34:54.092
This is somethin' that my grandfather 
brought back from the old country.

34:54.092 --> 34:56.793
Your old man's gonna get a real kick out of this.

34:56.793 --> 34:59.282
I don't wanna be late, man. Come on.

35:00.299 --> 35:02.449
Sure.

35:02.662 --> 35:06.213
My mother must've m-moved things around.

35:09.833 --> 35:11.428
Easy, boys.

35:11.428 --> 35:13.603
You boys smokin' cigarettes down here?

35:13.603 --> 35:15.245
This is my mother's house, officer.

35:15.245 --> 35:16.760
I'm just gettin' my stuff.
She knows I'm here.

35:16.760 --> 35:20.926
Until we verify that, why don't you put 
your hands down on that counter there.

35:21.700 --> 35:23.316
What, you cops been watchin' us?

35:23.316 --> 35:25.712
What, Louis didn't mention it?

35:26.188 --> 35:27.473
We ran into him this morning.

35:27.473 --> 35:29.430
Sorry, Chops.
It's okay, Lou-Lou.

35:29.430 --> 35:31.512
They're just screwin' with you.

35:32.446 --> 35:33.717
Oh, you brought the whole precinct?

35:33.717 --> 35:35.819
They're responding to a burglary call.

35:35.819 --> 35:37.527
Oh, they're clean.

35:39.151 --> 35:41.525
All right. Now...

35:43.776 --> 35:46.751
this stuff that you came here to get...

35:47.591 --> 35:49.290
Where is it?

35:49.290 --> 35:51.294
It's none of your business.

35:52.234 --> 35:55.257
Well, Gina Rigatello, 
the owner of the house... That's your mother?

35:55.257 --> 35:57.988
Because the two of you don't have the same last name.

35:58.604 --> 35:59.753
Did she divorce your dad?

35:59.753 --> 36:02.350
Or maybe she wasn't married when she had you.

36:04.093 --> 36:07.159
What's up, Chops?
What's the matter?

36:07.159 --> 36:10.335
Searching for the appropriate response? Try, uh...

36:10.335 --> 36:12.255
Try lookin' hurt.

36:15.719 --> 36:19.588
Now, you were standing right here...

36:19.745 --> 36:21.725
when we came in.

36:22.835 --> 36:25.063
Were you looking in this box?

36:27.091 --> 36:28.281
Huh. Christmas decorations.

36:28.281 --> 36:31.274
Were you getting a jump on trimming the tree?

36:31.453 --> 36:35.932
That puncture mark on the inside here...

36:36.173 --> 36:38.360
Looks like it was made with a sharp-tipped object.

36:38.360 --> 36:41.964
Yeah. The cardboard along the cut,

36:41.964 --> 36:44.926
it isn't as discolored as the rest.

36:44.926 --> 36:46.890
Looks more recent.

36:49.439 --> 36:51.656
Were you keeping a knife in here?

36:51.656 --> 36:53.017
Is that what you were looking for?

36:53.017 --> 36:55.255
Did he take a knife from here?

36:56.854 --> 36:59.720
Then why were you poking around in the box?

36:59.720 --> 37:01.688
There's no knife.

37:01.838 --> 37:04.361
Were you guys gonna throw a little party for Mikey?

37:04.361 --> 37:06.913
- Was that the idea?
- We weren't plannin' nothin'.

37:06.913 --> 37:10.820
Don't listen to this.
They're just screwin' with us.

37:11.496 --> 37:15.116
What down here belongs to you?

37:18.038 --> 37:20.345
How about this hockey stick? This yours?

37:20.345 --> 37:22.315
Nope. Got somebody else's name on it.

37:22.315 --> 37:23.914
I didn't grow up here.

37:24.681 --> 37:27.115
Your mother didn't raise you?
She put you up for adoption?

37:27.115 --> 37:28.099
She had to.

37:28.099 --> 37:30.490
Is that why you went to live 
with your uncle, Uncle Eddie?

37:30.490 --> 37:33.474
The late great Uncle Eddie who shot Dan Lucci.

37:33.474 --> 37:35.112
That's a lie.

37:35.112 --> 37:39.232
You know, Mikey, we found Uncle Eddie 
dead in his house, in the garage.

37:39.232 --> 37:41.332
He had a knife in his heart.

37:41.332 --> 37:44.643
That's the story of Rickie's life, you know.

37:46.243 --> 37:48.742
Everyone's always leavin' him.

37:49.009 --> 37:53.306
- They die, go to prison...
- Or they turn him out on the street.

37:54.175 --> 37:56.102
Like his mother.

37:58.139 --> 38:02.096
Uh... sadness.

38:03.029 --> 38:05.062
Sadness would be an appropriate response.

38:05.062 --> 38:07.542
I got something here.

38:11.868 --> 38:15.046
Oh, a.22 auto.

38:15.335 --> 38:20.535
Silencer, anti-fingerprint grip,
a hitter's special.

38:20.535 --> 38:22.946
Hang on.

38:23.457 --> 38:26.544
It's only accessible from this side.

38:27.305 --> 38:29.791
It's perfect for a left-handed shooter.

38:32.722 --> 38:33.691
You're left-handed,
aren't you, Mikey?

38:33.691 --> 38:36.196
No. That ain't mine.

38:36.814 --> 38:38.979
No. You know, now...

38:40.496 --> 38:42.766
l-I think I get it.

38:43.966 --> 38:47.562
Chops, Mikey turned the tables on you.

38:47.562 --> 38:49.869
I don't know what he's talkin' about.

38:50.301 --> 38:55.588
All that time you spent 
suckin'up to his father, you know.

38:55.588 --> 38:58.545
Those visits late at night,
bringin' him figs.

38:58.545 --> 39:00.709
You been to see my pops?

39:01.040 --> 39:03.122
You didn't tell me that.

39:03.240 --> 39:05.303
Don't act like you didn't know, Mikey.

39:05.303 --> 39:08.035
Come on.
You don't really believe...

39:08.035 --> 39:11.801
that the don would let you kill his baby boy.

39:11.801 --> 39:14.868
I mean, you really don't know anything about family.

39:14.868 --> 39:16.794
Or loyalty.

39:18.494 --> 39:22.794
- Well, how could you?
- Shut up. This is just lies.

39:26.138 --> 39:28.693
You want proof of how little you know about loyalty?

39:28.693 --> 39:32.313
How do you think Mikey knew 
you were bringing him here?

39:33.354 --> 39:35.419
Chops, I swear...

39:35.419 --> 39:38.776
Come on.
You can't blame Louis.

39:39.096 --> 39:41.691
He saw how you turned on Uncle Eddie.

39:41.691 --> 39:44.409
On my mother's grave, 
I didn't know Mikey was gonna pull this crap.

39:44.409 --> 39:46.872
- What are you talkin' about?
- Shut up, the both of you!

39:46.872 --> 39:49.857
Don't you lumps get it?
They're just tryin' to set us up, man.

39:49.857 --> 39:54.678
You don't get it. You think fear is 
what binds people to you?

39:55.247 --> 39:58.909
It isn't. It's respect.

39:59.021 --> 40:02.464
- Louis doesn't respect you.
- That's not true, Chops.

40:03.885 --> 40:06.548
You know,
I just thought of somethin'.

40:08.299 --> 40:11.631
Mikey, he was gonna pull his piece.

40:12.688 --> 40:14.852
What were you gonna do?

40:17.502 --> 40:19.495
Huh?

40:20.394 --> 40:22.538
Do you have a weapon hidden somewhere?

40:22.538 --> 40:23.992
Maybe you missed it in the pat-down.

40:23.992 --> 40:27.201
You know, I might have.
Maybe I should have another look.

40:27.201 --> 40:28.979
You wanna be the king?

40:29.185 --> 40:33.262
A king rules by rewarding loyalty with loyalty.

40:33.391 --> 40:37.734
They take care of their people,
even their enemies.

40:38.052 --> 40:43.911
Oh, yeah. I mean, how would a guy 
like you be expected to know that?

40:45.536 --> 40:49.622
I mean, everything you learned about 
care you learned from your mother.

40:56.259 --> 40:58.739
You ever ask her why she gave you up?

40:58.739 --> 41:00.723
She was too young to take care of me.

41:00.723 --> 41:02.147
You're gonna love this, Louis.

41:02.147 --> 41:04.228
It's the same reason why she named him Chops.

41:04.228 --> 41:06.181
Because he was born with a mouthful of teeth.

41:06.181 --> 41:07.426
Shut up about that.

41:07.426 --> 41:09.446
The first day she took him home to nurse him, 
you know what he did?

41:09.446 --> 41:13.673
- I'm not listening to this, Chops.
- You wanna know? Huh?

41:13.790 --> 41:15.270
He bit her.

41:16.707 --> 41:18.916
He bit her right on the breast.

41:18.916 --> 41:21.351
- He made her bleed.
- You son of a bitch. That's a lie.

41:21.351 --> 41:23.679
You know, she found him repulsive.

41:23.679 --> 41:27.361
She put him out like a dog on the street.

41:27.935 --> 41:31.739
What's this?
What'd you do in here? Geez.

41:32.159 --> 41:34.094
I don't know how that got there.

41:34.094 --> 41:36.860
Something's stuck on it.
It's not blood.

41:37.551 --> 41:40.055
Seeds smell like fruit.

41:40.634 --> 41:43.663
See the bits of black pulp?

41:45.060 --> 41:48.792
It's fig, right? Black fig?

41:48.792 --> 41:51.178
I don't eat figs.

41:51.877 --> 41:55.811
This is what you brought 
Mr. Damiano. Black figs.

41:56.976 --> 41:58.359
You been seein' the don behind my back?

41:58.359 --> 42:00.816
No, Chops! I swear!

42:01.089 --> 42:02.761
You know what, Chops?

42:04.260 --> 42:06.906
I think Louis has turned on you,

42:06.906 --> 42:09.164
just like everybody does.

42:17.447 --> 42:21.353
You have been!
I'll kill you, cut your eyes out!

42:21.353 --> 42:22.929
Keep him away from me! He's nuts!

42:22.929 --> 42:25.810
Faccia brutta...
I'll split you like a pig!

42:25.810 --> 42:28.087
You want protection?
Huh? You wanna make a deal?

42:28.087 --> 42:30.233
Yeah, yeah. 
I want protection from him. I want a deal.

42:30.233 --> 42:31.685
I'll bitch you up if you open your mouth!

42:31.685 --> 42:34.452
That D.A.'s wife... He stuck her.
He put her down and he stuck her.

42:34.452 --> 42:36.703
And the Lucci kid... It was all his idea.

42:36.703 --> 42:38.062
You're never even gonna 
make it to the courthouse.

42:38.062 --> 42:40.232
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got protection now.

42:40.232 --> 42:41.639
You're under arrest, Rickie.

42:41.639 --> 42:43.347
- You too, Mikey.
- Hey, what did I do?

42:43.347 --> 42:44.505
It was all this sick mutt!

42:44.505 --> 42:47.327
Who's talkin'? You should hear the 
way your father speaks about you.

42:47.327 --> 42:49.810
He wants to put a bullet in your head.

42:51.081 --> 42:53.342
I spit on you Damianos.

42:55.035 --> 42:58.484
Hey, you got it! That's it. Rage.

42:58.484 --> 43:02.212
That's the appropriate response. Rage.

43:06.743 --> 43:10.359
He better save some of that.
He's gonna need it where he's goin'.

43:10.359 --> 43:14.145
To hell? He's already there.
