00:48.003 --> 00:50.017
Sh, sh, sh, sh.

02:04.964 --> 02:06.723
Come on, Lu.

02:07.971 --> 02:09.411
Sweetie, can you get the door.

02:34.147 --> 02:35.107
Seat belt, baby.

03:17.507 --> 03:18.371
How's school?

03:23.619 --> 03:24.420
Lu.

03:26.019 --> 03:26.820
Really?

03:27.971 --> 03:28.769
Pardon?

03:28.771 --> 03:30.115
I said, how's school?

03:31.491 --> 03:33.825
I'm on probation
for two weeks.

03:33.827 --> 03:35.329
You think that's funny?

03:35.331 --> 03:37.090
No, I just haven't
thought it through yet.

03:37.092 --> 03:38.916
Well why don't you
explain it to me.

03:41.796 --> 03:42.850
You just missed

03:42.852 --> 03:43.489
- the turn off.
- That was the turn off.

03:43.491 --> 03:44.580
Okay.

04:49.219 --> 04:51.202
Luana, we made a deal.

04:51.204 --> 04:52.417
That's rude,

04:52.419 --> 04:53.601
- y'all can't just...
- Just put it away

04:53.603 --> 04:55.044
or I'm taking it
away, I'm serious.

04:57.924 --> 04:59.105
Hey, about school,

04:59.107 --> 05:01.057
I'd very much like
an explanation.

05:01.059 --> 05:02.499
Can we please discuss
it at Grandpy's?

05:05.252 --> 05:06.689
How long will that be?

05:06.691 --> 05:09.348
If we don't stop every hour
we'll be there before dark.

05:12.803 --> 05:14.019
Is someone gonna tell me?

05:33.315 --> 05:35.201
Does your mother know?

05:35.203 --> 05:36.545
Marty, I told you I,

05:36.547 --> 05:37.569
wait, are you
talking about Luana?

05:37.571 --> 05:39.010
Yes, of course.

05:39.012 --> 05:40.738
No, I don't wanna give her
anything else to worry about.

05:40.740 --> 05:41.698
Please, that's not
what I'm talking about.

05:41.700 --> 05:43.521
Did you ask Luana?

05:43.523 --> 05:44.321
What if she was to say...

05:44.323 --> 05:45.121
I didn't ask Luana.

05:45.123 --> 05:46.305
What if she was to say

05:46.307 --> 05:48.481
you don't say anything
about us separating?

05:48.483 --> 05:50.210
You wanna make
her a part of this?

05:51.427 --> 05:52.994
Now what the hell did she do?

05:54.115 --> 05:55.553
She made
a stupid choice.

05:55.555 --> 05:58.145
Is somebody gonna tell me,
or do I make a stupid choice?

05:58.147 --> 05:58.947
Hey.

06:00.195 --> 06:01.665
What did you do?

06:01.667 --> 06:04.930
Marty, I said,
let's discuss it at Grandpa's.

06:04.932 --> 06:06.147
What did you do?

06:10.083 --> 06:11.105
Marty!

06:11.107 --> 06:12.129
Marty!

06:12.131 --> 06:12.769
Dad!

06:12.771 --> 06:13.953
Oh my god!

06:13.955 --> 06:15.041
Pull over, pull over!

06:15.043 --> 06:17.889
Oh god, pull over, pull over.

06:17.891 --> 06:20.961
Oh Jesus.

06:25.795 --> 06:27.489
You know what, I'm
gonna keep it a secret

06:27.491 --> 06:29.986
that you snuck out of the
house last night, how's that?

06:29.988 --> 06:31.105
What?

06:31.107 --> 06:32.866
What, who were you with?

06:32.868 --> 06:33.793
Were you with Jalla?

06:33.795 --> 06:34.881
Who else?

06:34.883 --> 06:35.777
Dammit, Luana!

06:35.779 --> 06:36.897
It's not that big a deal.

06:36.899 --> 06:38.369
It is a big deal.

06:38.371 --> 06:40.065
You don't go anywhere for a
year, do you understand me?

06:40.067 --> 06:41.249
Nowhere.

06:41.251 --> 06:42.433
And don't you say
anything to Grammy

06:42.435 --> 06:44.481
about us separating,
do you understand?

06:52.387 --> 06:53.763
Keep your eyes on the road.

07:01.731 --> 07:05.187
Okay, so I'm taking one
dress and one pair of pants,

07:06.050 --> 07:08.515
and your old dirty green KONG.

07:11.107 --> 07:12.835
Maybe Daddy will play with you.

07:13.923 --> 07:15.459
Do you remember Daddy's place?

07:17.955 --> 07:19.043
Two dresses?

07:25.058 --> 07:26.817
Do you remember
Daddy is the question

07:26.819 --> 07:28.579
that we are asking today.

07:31.299 --> 07:33.507
He may be very sick, Aubrey.

07:35.172 --> 07:37.793
So be mindful of that if
he doesn't wanna play,

07:37.795 --> 07:40.323
or if you don't
wanna play, old man.

07:42.147 --> 07:44.450
My god, he may be ,

07:49.635 --> 07:53.825
please in your mercy, I know
he hasn't been observant

07:53.827 --> 07:58.081
but he's a good, good man,
and one of your children,

07:58.083 --> 08:00.961
albeit a lying little piss.

08:00.963 --> 08:01.860
Forgive him.

08:04.355 --> 08:06.977
Two pairs of shoes?

08:06.979 --> 08:07.810
What do you think?

08:08.707 --> 08:11.107
Yeah, oh what the hell, why not?

08:12.516 --> 08:13.889
Why don't
you want her to know?

08:13.891 --> 08:15.265
Duh.

08:15.267 --> 08:16.705
Grandpy's
really sick, he might not,

08:16.707 --> 08:19.203
just remember, we're
still together, okay?

08:23.491 --> 08:24.289
Hi mom.

08:24.291 --> 08:25.283
Hi, honey.

08:26.403 --> 08:27.425
Oh, it's so great
to see you all.

08:27.427 --> 08:28.641
You too.

08:28.643 --> 08:29.472
Mm.

08:29.474 --> 08:31.105
- Hi.
- How are you?

08:31.107 --> 08:32.448
Oh.

08:32.450 --> 08:34.690
Bettye Sue,
you look wonderful.

08:34.692 --> 08:35.777
Oh thanks, Marty.

08:35.779 --> 08:37.664
How is he, is he feeling okay?

08:37.667 --> 08:40.865
Uh well, he may
be a little hungry.

08:40.866 --> 08:41.921
Mom, he'll be fine.

08:41.923 --> 08:43.616
We'll grab a bite when we stop.

08:43.619 --> 08:47.457
Okay uh, are you hungry,
can I fix you something?

08:47.459 --> 08:48.801
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- No, we're good.

08:48.803 --> 08:50.752
Pretty long drive, six hours.

08:50.754 --> 08:51.876
Yeah, if you speed.

08:54.051 --> 08:55.488
Let me
help you with Aubrey.

08:55.490 --> 08:56.929
No, I'll just
put him on my lap, honey.

08:56.931 --> 08:59.136
Well, you know, Luana
can keep him on her lap.

08:59.138 --> 09:01.761
She loves dogs, right Lu?

09:01.763 --> 09:03.137
Come on baby.

09:03.139 --> 09:04.833
Come on, big boy,
oh, there we go.

09:04.835 --> 09:05.795
There we go.

09:07.043 --> 09:08.961
Hi, Aubrey.

09:27.300 --> 09:29.281
Graham Dietz, Hillary Post,

09:29.283 --> 09:31.937
and Nelson Mahone
send their love.

09:31.939 --> 09:33.507
Marty, you look at little tired.

09:34.691 --> 09:36.385
How are you, honey?

09:36.387 --> 09:38.081
I like your hair.

09:38.083 --> 09:38.851
Aubrey?

09:40.195 --> 09:41.796
He thinks your
hair is beautiful.

09:43.875 --> 09:45.857
Weather's been frightening.

09:45.859 --> 09:46.915
I don't scare easy.

09:48.387 --> 09:50.689
You look beautiful,
how are you, honey?

09:50.691 --> 09:51.491
Thanks.

09:52.898 --> 09:54.881
You know, I dreamed
about this last night,

09:54.883 --> 09:56.289
just last night.

09:56.291 --> 10:01.091
Of you and me and, you
know, autumn splendor,

10:02.083 --> 10:04.929
colors, leaves drifting down,

10:04.931 --> 10:08.387
softly, gently, slowly
like little lives.

10:11.267 --> 10:13.345
It was 80 degrees on Tuesday.

10:33.795 --> 10:38.145
Prodigious, fine,
you don't have to do this.

10:38.147 --> 10:40.067
Yeah well
I said I would, so.

10:41.731 --> 10:44.673
I said a thousand
things I said I'd do.

10:44.675 --> 10:47.905
Never felt actually
compelled to do them.

10:47.907 --> 10:49.153
Not all of them.

10:49.155 --> 10:50.496
You have to make
astute decisions.

10:50.498 --> 10:52.738
No, no philosophy or I
definitely won't do it.

10:52.740 --> 10:56.416
Well, I appreciate your
effort, means a lot to me.

10:56.418 --> 10:59.009
See, and that is
why I'm doing it.

11:03.300 --> 11:04.449
Okay.

11:04.451 --> 11:06.209
They'll get a huge
kick outta this.

11:06.211 --> 11:07.872
And you won't?

11:07.874 --> 11:09.761
You'll be in seventh heaven.

11:17.763 --> 11:18.594
Is Hugh in pain?

11:20.099 --> 11:20.867
He's hinted.

11:22.915 --> 11:23.969
What?

11:23.971 --> 11:26.241
Very strong prescriptions.

11:26.243 --> 11:28.161
I'm not sure he
wants to take them.

11:28.163 --> 11:28.931
Hugh?

11:33.091 --> 11:34.627
What's wrong with his kidneys?

11:35.651 --> 11:36.803
They're shutting down.

11:37.730 --> 11:38.913
Is that for sure?

11:38.915 --> 11:40.512
Did he tell you, or...

11:40.514 --> 11:42.849
I got a from a Dr. Belmaraz.

11:42.851 --> 11:43.969
His doctor?

11:43.971 --> 11:46.561
I guess, or the
nurse, how would I know?

11:46.563 --> 11:49.027
I haven't seen him
in three years.

11:52.579 --> 11:54.178
Oh honey, honey, he's peeing.

11:54.180 --> 11:55.329
Oh my god,

11:55.331 --> 11:56.225
- shit, shit, shit.
- No, no, no.

11:56.227 --> 11:57.537
Luana, do not use that word.

11:57.539 --> 11:58.433
Look what he did!

11:58.435 --> 11:59.585
Okay, I see it.

11:59.587 --> 12:00.545
- I'm sorry, honey.
- Just pull over, Marty.

12:00.547 --> 12:01.953
- I'm so sorry.
- Right here.

12:01.955 --> 12:04.833
- Just pull over right here.
- Okay, okay, okay.

12:21.410 --> 12:22.625
- Ah!
- Leave the window

12:22.627 --> 12:24.288
- down a little bit.
- Look at this.

12:24.290 --> 12:25.505
Ew.

12:25.507 --> 12:26.752
Hun, it's
just a little pee.

12:26.754 --> 12:28.065
- Oh, it's the worst.
- Get you cleaned up.

12:28.067 --> 12:28.771
Wash the dress.

12:31.075 --> 12:31.875
It's fine.

12:33.795 --> 12:36.160
- Thank you.
- Let me have him.

12:39.746 --> 12:40.931
Okay, come on baby.

12:43.171 --> 12:44.131
Thank you.

12:44.994 --> 12:46.593
Hi, we need uh, bathrooms.

12:46.595 --> 12:48.001
Right down there.

12:48.003 --> 12:49.248
Mom, I can do it.

12:49.250 --> 12:50.051
Okay.

12:52.003 --> 12:53.217
Uh, table for four, please.

12:53.219 --> 12:55.905
Okay,
right this way.

13:07.682 --> 13:10.656
Great breed,
y'all take care now.

13:10.658 --> 13:12.897
Thank you, bye bye.

13:12.899 --> 13:14.851
Yes, what a nice man, isn't he?

13:16.003 --> 13:17.472
Are you feeling a little better?

13:17.474 --> 13:19.649
Yeah, a little calmer.

13:19.651 --> 13:21.859
That's it, just
breathe, breathe.

13:29.123 --> 13:31.521
Hey, do you know
who she was with?

13:31.523 --> 13:33.187
Jalla and some kid.

13:34.339 --> 13:35.937
I think it was one
of Belamy's sons.

13:35.939 --> 13:37.281
Who?

13:37.283 --> 13:39.971
They own the dairy,
whatever, the ice cream place.

13:42.594 --> 13:44.322
Do you know how
old he, nevermind.

13:47.523 --> 13:50.147
So, you don't
want her to know?

13:51.587 --> 13:52.419
Definitely not.

14:01.730 --> 14:03.426
It was
good last night.

14:09.571 --> 14:11.328
I'm having second
thoughts about including her

14:11.330 --> 14:13.312
in our little charade.

14:13.314 --> 14:17.090
She likes being in on it,
sharing with us, anything.

14:21.666 --> 14:22.531
Anything.

14:24.611 --> 14:26.435
You know what I mean.

14:29.634 --> 14:31.266
Was it as good as Gretchen?

14:53.507 --> 14:54.306
Did you?

14:55.811 --> 14:57.251
Did you?

14:58.146 --> 14:58.946
Whoa.

15:23.810 --> 15:25.601
Hi, what can
I get for you today?

15:25.603 --> 15:30.403
Um, I will have
the um, ooh yes,

15:31.555 --> 15:34.464
the country ham and
biscuits and gravy,

15:34.466 --> 15:37.025
- and unsweetened tea.
- Okay.

15:37.027 --> 15:39.777
Yeah, no um, I'll
have ice tea sweet.

15:39.779 --> 15:40.576
Okay.

15:40.578 --> 15:42.432
Oh, speaking of sweet.

15:42.434 --> 15:43.425
Um, on the mirror...

15:43.427 --> 15:44.609
Honey,
order something.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.913
Give her a chance to
look at the menu first.

15:46.915 --> 15:48.290
Yeah it's just...

15:49.443 --> 15:51.232
Rush, rush, rush.

15:51.234 --> 15:53.443
Forget it, forgive
me, Luana, read.

15:54.563 --> 15:56.065
Um, grilled cheese
and root beer.

15:56.067 --> 15:57.347
Okay.

16:00.131 --> 16:01.250
What, honey?

16:02.787 --> 16:03.586
Nothing.

16:05.634 --> 16:08.577
We met the nicest man
out there, he has a corgi.

16:08.579 --> 16:09.827
Oh, save your leftovers.

16:15.554 --> 16:17.441
Are you wearing lipstick?

16:17.443 --> 16:18.784
What?

16:18.786 --> 16:20.385
Oh,
it's very subtle.

16:20.387 --> 16:21.185
Nice.

16:21.187 --> 16:21.987
It's,

16:23.618 --> 16:24.640
wipe it off.

16:24.642 --> 16:25.600
Oh, it's just...

16:25.602 --> 16:27.648
- Just leave it.
- She's just...

16:27.650 --> 16:28.771
Just leave it.

16:39.554 --> 16:42.912
Aubrey, country ham.

16:42.914 --> 16:44.994
Mm, mm, yes little doggie.

16:46.786 --> 16:49.152
- Where're your other clothes?
- Country ham.

16:49.154 --> 16:50.304
Luana.

16:50.306 --> 16:52.163
Oh, yes.

16:53.538 --> 16:56.064
We're making good time.

16:56.066 --> 16:57.122
She's upset.

16:58.242 --> 17:00.674
Mm,
mm, mm, oh yes.

17:21.666 --> 17:23.010
Luana, come on baby.

17:25.474 --> 17:26.371
Where's your stuff?

17:40.259 --> 17:43.168
Don't look down,
and don't get tangled.

17:43.170 --> 17:45.376
Don't look up and I
won't spit in your eye.

17:45.378 --> 17:46.272
I'm serious.

17:46.274 --> 17:47.968
I am too, daddy jacker.

17:47.970 --> 17:49.888
Language like that'll get
you tossed off the mountain.

17:49.890 --> 17:52.064
Oh, I'd
like to see you try.

17:52.066 --> 17:54.401
Chill, Captain, I'm
just pullin' your chain.

17:54.403 --> 17:56.034
Pull my heartstrings instead.

17:57.314 --> 17:59.009
Stay alert, do your job.

17:59.011 --> 18:00.610
Hey, you wanna come up here?

18:02.339 --> 18:03.584
Okay.

18:09.635 --> 18:10.914
Superb.

18:13.026 --> 18:14.944
Lu, do you remember Grandpy?

18:14.946 --> 18:17.888
I think you were only about
six the last time you saw him.

18:17.890 --> 18:19.392
Five.

18:19.394 --> 18:21.120
You remember
him, don't you Lu?

18:21.122 --> 18:22.562
Remember what he looks like?

18:23.586 --> 18:24.993
Kind of.

18:24.995 --> 18:28.353
Well he's gonna be very
happy to see you.

18:28.355 --> 18:30.336
I'll be happy to see him too.

18:30.338 --> 18:32.384
How long till we get
back to his house?

18:32.386 --> 18:33.571
Probably be dark.

18:35.202 --> 18:37.632
You could have a
drink, go to bed early.

18:37.634 --> 18:39.136
You can text Jalla
and let her know

18:39.138 --> 18:40.674
I'm gonna be calling her mother.

18:44.291 --> 18:48.832
Actually, dancing,
we all danced.

18:48.834 --> 18:50.178
You and Grandpy danced.

18:51.170 --> 18:52.353
Am I right?

18:52.355 --> 18:55.170
Yeah, impeccably,
we danced, always.

18:56.675 --> 18:58.658
Until we danced away
from each other.

19:01.571 --> 19:04.320
So Marty, you think it will
be dark when we get there?

19:04.322 --> 19:05.760
I do, yep.

19:05.762 --> 19:09.504
I think maybe we better stop
so I can walk Aubrey again.

19:09.506 --> 19:12.576
I just don't want him to have
another accident in the car.

19:12.578 --> 19:13.379
Okay.

19:23.010 --> 19:25.216
He's all
she's got left.

19:25.218 --> 19:26.371
What about us?

19:27.746 --> 19:29.826
As a companion,
honey, you know what I mean.

20:12.642 --> 20:15.200
Would anybody else
love an ice cream?

20:15.202 --> 20:17.411
Um, yeah, I'd love one.

20:34.499 --> 20:37.858
Tell 'em the
other vans have left.

20:41.026 --> 20:42.400
Thanks.

20:42.402 --> 20:43.200
Two cherry?

20:43.202 --> 20:44.576
Grandma wants cherry.

20:44.578 --> 20:45.824
- Hi.
- Hi.

20:45.826 --> 20:47.424
Um, two cherry.

20:47.426 --> 20:48.832
No cherry.

20:48.834 --> 20:53.344
Uh, okay, two vanilla cones,
one chocolate milkshake,

20:53.346 --> 20:56.418
and let's see, one
strawberry cone.

20:57.314 --> 20:58.402
- Awesome.
- Thank you.

21:00.226 --> 21:01.952
How old is he?

21:01.954 --> 21:02.914
Oh, he's a rescue.

21:04.355 --> 21:05.760
You mean Hugh?

21:05.762 --> 21:08.450
Oh well, this one's
old, Hugh's 76.

21:09.730 --> 21:10.912
How much did he tell you?

21:10.914 --> 21:12.514
Is he, is he scared?

21:13.474 --> 21:14.689
You know, I believe so.

21:15.811 --> 21:17.312
I never would've
thought so before.

21:17.314 --> 21:20.128
He's so cool, I
mean, you know him.

21:20.130 --> 21:24.064
But he wants me there, he
wants all of us there, so.

21:24.066 --> 21:25.088
I'm sorry.

21:25.090 --> 21:25.858
Yeah.

21:29.026 --> 21:29.824
Luana.

21:29.826 --> 21:30.690
Bathroom.

21:34.338 --> 21:35.234
Oh.

22:13.890 --> 22:14.912
He
wants the ice cream.

22:14.914 --> 22:16.608
It's right there.

22:16.610 --> 22:18.465
So you said you haven't
seen Dad in three years?

22:18.467 --> 22:20.097
When was the last
time that you saw him?

22:20.099 --> 22:20.898
Mom.

22:22.338 --> 22:23.711
Yeah?

22:23.713 --> 22:24.993
Listen, listen, when we
stopped at the other restaurant

22:24.995 --> 22:26.080
before I lost my clothes.

22:26.082 --> 22:27.551
- Yeah?
- What?

22:27.553 --> 22:29.471
Some girl wrote, "He broke
my nose, he broke my teeth,"

22:29.473 --> 22:31.487
with lipstick on
the mirror, "crazy."

22:31.489 --> 22:33.088
What do you mean, what girl?

22:33.090 --> 22:34.529
I don't know,
that's the point.

22:34.531 --> 22:35.360
Who broke her nose?

22:35.362 --> 22:36.800
How would I know?

22:36.802 --> 22:39.008
But she wrote again on this
bathroom mirror at this place.

22:39.010 --> 22:40.576
It said, "He's gonna
kill me, help."

22:40.578 --> 22:41.953
The same song was playing.

22:43.106 --> 22:44.000
Mercy.

22:44.002 --> 22:45.184
What're we gonna do?

22:45.186 --> 22:46.368
Luana, why didn't
you say something?

22:46.370 --> 22:48.064
Mom, right now,
we need to help her.

22:48.066 --> 22:49.600
Well, what do you
think we should do?

22:49.602 --> 22:51.136
I don't know, call
somebody, the police maybe.

22:51.138 --> 22:53.536
You know, I'm just
saying, it's 4:15,

22:53.538 --> 22:55.168
your dad's expecting
us, just take that...

22:55.170 --> 22:56.928
- Marty.
- Hey, stop!

22:56.930 --> 23:00.287
Okay, okay, take
this, show me.

23:00.289 --> 23:01.058
Come on.

23:05.282 --> 23:07.072
I'm sorry, there just
wasn't any other place.

23:07.074 --> 23:09.088
Oh, that's all
right, don't be silly.

23:09.090 --> 23:10.944
Been there, done that,
this one's my baby.

23:10.946 --> 23:12.288
Did you wipe some
writing off the mirror?

23:12.290 --> 23:13.696
- Huh?
- Honey.

23:13.698 --> 23:14.624
It was written in lipstick.

23:14.626 --> 23:15.520
Luana.

23:15.522 --> 23:17.248
It said, "He's gonna kill me."

23:17.250 --> 23:18.400
I'm sorry.

23:18.402 --> 23:19.840
What are you doing?

23:19.842 --> 23:20.640
It was there two minutes
ago, Mom, I just saw it.

23:20.642 --> 23:21.696
Honey, it's okay...

23:21.698 --> 23:22.912
It's not okay.

23:22.914 --> 23:24.928
Somebody wiped it off,
some girl's in danger.

23:24.930 --> 23:27.136
She's gonna be
killed, Mom, murdered.

23:27.138 --> 23:29.024
What are you, hey, wait.

23:29.026 --> 23:30.496
Wait, wait, wait.

23:30.498 --> 23:31.680
Luana.

23:31.682 --> 23:33.345
- Luana, listen!
- What?

23:33.347 --> 23:35.968
Don't shout,
what is, calm down.

23:35.970 --> 23:37.024
Oh god.

23:37.026 --> 23:38.432
Hey, Luana, hey.

23:38.434 --> 23:40.256
I'm not your baby,
don't treat me...

23:40.258 --> 23:42.240
I know how you feel
about your father and me.

23:42.242 --> 23:43.424
What?

23:43.426 --> 23:44.577
This has nothing to
do with either of you.

23:44.579 --> 23:45.952
I know.

23:45.954 --> 23:46.944
I keep thinking it's
gonna get better as well.

23:46.946 --> 23:48.898
We're trying, we're hoping.

23:50.274 --> 23:52.257
I want it to, but honey, I
can't do anything right now.

23:52.259 --> 23:55.007
Mom, I, just don't, please.

23:55.009 --> 23:56.224
Listen to me, just...

23:56.226 --> 23:57.026
Don't.

23:59.394 --> 24:00.546
Why did you sneak out?

24:02.210 --> 24:03.266
Dad spent the night.

24:05.826 --> 24:09.311
Honey, I'm
sorry, but that doesn't mean

24:09.313 --> 24:11.010
that you sneak out, okay?

24:12.450 --> 24:14.337
Who's the boy you were with?

24:14.339 --> 24:15.362
You don't know him.

24:17.762 --> 24:19.712
I don't want Jalla and
some boy that I don't know

24:19.714 --> 24:22.368
to be who you listen to, okay?

24:22.370 --> 24:23.554
Who should I listen to?

24:29.058 --> 24:31.170
Luana, hey, honey.

24:33.506 --> 24:34.689
Hey, hey, hey.

24:39.682 --> 24:40.320
You okay?

24:40.322 --> 24:41.087
Mom, I'm fine.

24:43.394 --> 24:44.195
Oh my god.

25:28.226 --> 25:29.632
Hey.

25:29.634 --> 25:31.328
Hey, don't hog
all the hot water.

25:38.242 --> 25:39.040
Come on.

25:49.986 --> 25:51.360
Did you
solve the mystery?

25:51.362 --> 25:53.792
No, and I don't
wanna talk about it.

25:53.794 --> 25:55.007
Somebody washed
the lipstick off.

25:55.009 --> 25:55.871
I know they did.

25:55.873 --> 25:56.672
Okay.

25:56.674 --> 25:57.599
It was there.

25:57.601 --> 25:58.720
Do you think I'm making it up?

25:58.722 --> 26:00.608
Did anyone else see it?

26:00.610 --> 26:01.760
There was a girl
at the first place,

26:01.762 --> 26:02.784
she thought it
was messed up too.

26:02.786 --> 26:04.032
Did she tell anybody?

26:04.034 --> 26:05.697
I don't know,
how should I know?

26:05.699 --> 26:07.168
But I saw it again
just now back there.

26:07.170 --> 26:09.119
I'm not saying you didn't.

26:09.121 --> 26:11.264
Did anybody that worked
there know anything about it?

26:11.266 --> 26:13.024
Or did anybody say anything?

26:13.026 --> 26:15.297
Whether you think so
or not, I'm on your side.

26:15.299 --> 26:16.991
Okay, we ran out
of there so quickly,

26:16.993 --> 26:19.360
we didn't get a chance
to ask anything.

26:19.362 --> 26:20.352
Oh shit.

26:20.354 --> 26:21.248
Lu.

26:21.250 --> 26:22.144
Are you listening to this?

26:22.146 --> 26:22.911
You okay with this profanity?

26:22.913 --> 26:24.384
No, I'm not.

26:24.386 --> 26:25.666
Don't ask me to go back.

26:44.099 --> 26:46.113
There comes an end to summer.

26:46.115 --> 26:48.802
To spring showers
and a hoar rime.

26:50.626 --> 26:54.529
His mumming to each mummer
has somewhere end in time.

26:56.675 --> 26:57.473
Hm.

27:00.610 --> 27:01.664
I think it's right here.

27:01.666 --> 27:02.464
No, no, no.

27:02.466 --> 27:03.680
Are you sure?

27:03.682 --> 27:04.482
Yeah.

27:05.474 --> 27:06.336
You've been here before?

27:06.338 --> 27:07.520
Mm-hmm.

27:07.522 --> 27:08.576
You have been here before?

27:08.578 --> 27:09.408
Yes.

27:09.410 --> 27:10.208
Really?

27:10.210 --> 27:11.392
Yeah, three years ago.

27:11.394 --> 27:13.218
Right before he left
for the holy land.

27:14.530 --> 27:16.288
Dad went to the holy land?

27:16.290 --> 27:17.090
Yes.

27:17.986 --> 27:19.103
Come on, you're kidding.

27:19.105 --> 27:20.226
- No.
- Why?

27:21.570 --> 27:22.978
He was searching.

27:24.257 --> 27:25.057
For what?

27:39.810 --> 27:43.904
Nay, sweet,
let's leave unspoken,

27:43.906 --> 27:46.367
the vows, the fates gainsay,

27:46.369 --> 27:48.928
for all vows made are broken.

27:48.930 --> 27:50.818
We love but while we may.

27:51.906 --> 27:53.504
You are lucky
they're running late.

27:53.506 --> 27:55.904
Lucky, my middle name.

27:55.906 --> 27:57.344
Oh yeah?

27:57.346 --> 27:58.751
Well what if they don't
show up till really late?

27:58.753 --> 28:00.450
Or what if they don't even
show up till tomorrow?

28:01.922 --> 28:03.488
Oh.

28:03.490 --> 28:05.183
What pleasure do you derive

28:05.185 --> 28:07.074
from all that endless pessimism?

28:08.034 --> 28:08.834
Bugs you.

28:10.754 --> 28:11.554
That's a perk.

28:25.026 --> 28:27.328
So, how long were you there?

28:27.330 --> 28:28.896
Two days.

28:28.898 --> 28:29.984
Was it pleasant?

28:29.986 --> 28:31.391
I mean, you know what I mean.

28:31.393 --> 28:32.960
Does he have wifi?

28:32.962 --> 28:34.431
Oh, goodness no.

28:34.433 --> 28:35.458
Cable, satellite?

28:36.578 --> 28:38.658
Grandpy wasn't even
sure he wanted a phone.

28:40.705 --> 28:43.714
It was classic, you know,
hopelessly pleasant.

28:46.050 --> 28:50.080
Ah, there it is, there it is,
we're right up there, yep.

28:57.442 --> 29:00.064
Mom, was he sick
the last time you were here?

29:00.066 --> 29:02.530
No, well, the usual,
nothing different.

29:03.649 --> 29:05.024
You know he used
to write to me?

29:05.026 --> 29:07.744
I mean, he never mentioned
the holy land, but.

29:07.746 --> 29:10.465
No, he wrote to you, he did?

29:11.329 --> 29:12.130
Ah.

29:14.882 --> 29:15.713
I'll be doggone.

29:17.794 --> 29:19.842
He was finally doing
what he wanted to do.

29:21.025 --> 29:22.239
DJ to the universe.

29:22.241 --> 29:23.231
Good for Hugh.

29:23.233 --> 29:24.287
What's the music?

29:24.289 --> 29:25.186
That's our song.

29:26.242 --> 29:27.010
Mercy, Mom.

29:38.626 --> 29:40.671
Hugh, you look great.

29:40.673 --> 29:42.112
You look tired.

29:42.114 --> 29:43.042
Come on out.

29:48.193 --> 29:49.760
Do you remember him now?

29:59.521 --> 30:00.575
Yes, we're here.

30:00.577 --> 30:01.920
Hey, baby.

30:01.922 --> 30:04.064
You
remember Daddy, don't you?

30:04.066 --> 30:05.441
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi.

30:07.842 --> 30:08.768
Got him?

30:08.770 --> 30:09.985
- Oh yeah.
- Okay.

30:11.170 --> 30:13.952
Yeah, she's
unequivocally a young lady,

30:13.954 --> 30:15.968
a beautiful young lady.

30:15.970 --> 30:18.047
Just
like her mother.

30:18.049 --> 30:19.714
And so much like
her grandmother.

30:21.026 --> 30:23.072
Come on in, I'll
show you your rooms.

30:23.074 --> 30:24.064
Place looks different.

30:24.066 --> 30:25.695
Well, we've been working.

30:25.697 --> 30:26.912
We?

30:26.914 --> 30:27.711
Oh yeah.

30:27.713 --> 30:28.575
Looks good.

30:29.794 --> 30:31.744
Oh ,
do you have a dog?

30:31.746 --> 30:35.103
I'll introduce you to
the captain and her dog.

30:35.105 --> 30:35.970
Oh, okay.

30:39.041 --> 30:39.810
Come on.

30:42.338 --> 30:43.775
- This is Jimmie.
- Hi.

30:43.777 --> 30:46.367
Jimmie, this is my wife,
Bettye Sue, my ex-wife.

30:46.369 --> 30:47.488
Nice to meet you.

30:47.490 --> 30:48.256
- Nice to meet you.
- And this is

30:48.258 --> 30:49.312
our daughter, Tasha.

30:49.314 --> 30:50.528
Hi there, hi, how are you?

30:50.530 --> 30:52.031
And this is her
husband, Marty.

30:52.033 --> 30:53.183
- Pleasure.
- Hi.

30:53.185 --> 30:55.648
And this is our
granddaughter, Luana.

30:55.650 --> 30:57.536
Hi, it's so nice
to meet all of you.

30:57.538 --> 30:59.199
I've heard so much about you,

30:59.201 --> 31:01.664
and Luana is a wonderful name.

31:01.666 --> 31:02.720
Thank you.

31:02.722 --> 31:04.064
And this Aubrey.

31:04.066 --> 31:04.865
Hi, Aubrey, hi.

31:05.953 --> 31:07.232
And this is Sybil.

31:07.234 --> 31:09.120
She's having her
second birthday tonight

31:09.122 --> 31:11.327
and she's thrilled to have
all of you at the party,

31:11.329 --> 31:12.130
as am I.

31:13.793 --> 31:15.106
Well, grab a drink.

31:17.506 --> 31:18.688
Champagne?

31:18.690 --> 31:20.672
Sparkling apple cider.

31:20.674 --> 31:21.664
Sorry, Tash.

31:21.666 --> 31:23.903
Happy to participate.

31:23.905 --> 31:25.919
Luana, you can drink
all you wanna drink.

31:25.921 --> 31:27.392
Cheers.

31:27.394 --> 31:30.431
Here's to the people and
the dogs that I love most

31:30.433 --> 31:32.514
in this world, and in the next.

31:37.633 --> 31:39.008
How long?

31:39.010 --> 31:42.303
Both two years tonight,
celebrations galore.

31:42.305 --> 31:44.002
Well, congratulations.

31:49.633 --> 31:51.745
He looks like he's hanging in.

31:52.993 --> 31:54.274
How 'bout you?

32:42.433 --> 32:44.447
You've done a lot.

33:00.450 --> 33:02.239
There you go.

33:08.322 --> 33:09.825
Okay, here you go.

33:10.913 --> 33:12.639
Which is your room, Jimmie?

33:12.641 --> 33:14.655
I am on the house on the hill.

33:14.657 --> 33:16.575
The old hunting lodge.

33:16.577 --> 33:17.375
Place looks great.

33:17.377 --> 33:18.527
- Yeah.
- Um-hm.

33:18.529 --> 33:20.159
Well, you guys have
a good evening.

33:20.161 --> 33:21.504
Oh, you're not gonna join us?

33:21.506 --> 33:22.880
No, it's family night.

33:22.882 --> 33:26.656
I am into the woods, but
I'll see you tomorrow.

33:26.658 --> 33:27.872
Come on, girl.

33:27.874 --> 33:28.767
Thanks, buddy.

33:28.769 --> 33:30.431
Of course, come on.

33:30.433 --> 33:32.159
Uh Hugh,
you want any help?

33:32.161 --> 33:34.559
Sit down, relax, be at home.

33:34.561 --> 33:38.367
Red beans and rice,
got gumbo, fried okra,

33:38.369 --> 33:40.479
cornbread, pineapple.

33:40.481 --> 33:42.272
Um-hm, looks great, Luana.

33:42.274 --> 33:43.423
I can do it.

33:43.425 --> 33:44.674
Okay honey, just
be careful, it's hot.

33:46.114 --> 33:48.130
If you guys wanna pass
your plates around.

33:58.050 --> 33:59.231
It
sure smells good.

33:59.233 --> 34:00.801
Mm-hmm,
it looks great too.

34:11.777 --> 34:15.710
Oh great spirit, we
are ever so thankful

34:15.713 --> 34:17.985
for our swell
provisions and dwelling,

34:19.138 --> 34:21.248
and beyond bliss to
be brought together

34:21.250 --> 34:22.721
in this, our family circle.

34:23.585 --> 34:24.382
Amen.

34:24.385 --> 34:25.567
Okay.

34:25.569 --> 34:28.255
Luana, have you ever
had gumbo before?

34:28.257 --> 34:29.058
No.

34:30.081 --> 34:31.040
I hope you like it.

34:31.042 --> 34:32.382
Me too.

34:33.762 --> 34:34.719
That's really good.

34:34.722 --> 34:35.681
What a treat.

34:36.960 --> 34:38.110
Did Jimmie cook?

34:38.112 --> 34:41.471
No, Jimmie's the
captain, I'm the cook.

34:41.473 --> 34:42.687
You?

34:42.688 --> 34:43.489
Yeah.

34:48.641 --> 34:50.463
When'd you start cookin', Dad?

34:50.465 --> 34:53.826
When no one else
would.

34:57.249 --> 34:59.871
I heard about your
expedition to the holy land.

34:59.873 --> 35:01.410
Is that where you
learned to pray?

35:03.778 --> 35:06.658
Never completely
forgotten, or lost.

35:09.025 --> 35:09.825
That's new.

35:10.978 --> 35:11.905
People change.

35:15.585 --> 35:16.385
Okay.

35:17.441 --> 35:19.487
A good day to uh...

35:19.489 --> 35:21.089
Mm, not at dinner.

35:29.602 --> 35:30.879
Thank you, Hugh.

35:30.881 --> 35:31.807
My greatest pleasure.

35:31.809 --> 35:34.625
Mm, coconut, Mom's favorite.

35:35.458 --> 35:36.416
Mine too.

35:36.418 --> 35:38.336
Yeah, well you
gotta come back.

35:38.338 --> 35:41.247
I don't know how you lost
weight, eating like this.

35:41.249 --> 35:42.049
Nevermind.

35:43.681 --> 35:45.087
Hugh, how'd you
find this place?

35:45.089 --> 35:49.889
On the job, '62 or
'63, I can't remember.

35:51.201 --> 35:52.991
Anyway, it was the biggest
deal in Appalachia.

35:52.993 --> 35:56.351
They used to move maybe
hundred barrels every week

35:56.353 --> 35:59.425
by mule train,
thousand gallons a run.

36:00.705 --> 36:02.881
It was a family business,
back to the '20s.

36:04.258 --> 36:08.129
It was New Year's Eve, the
good stuff was being served.

36:09.570 --> 36:12.641
Allegheny moon, snow
piled high, beautiful.

36:14.241 --> 36:17.761
Anyway, 2009, the
property came up for sale.

36:20.641 --> 36:23.104
Well you've done a
wonderful job with it.

36:23.106 --> 36:25.151
Looks very different than
the last time I was here,

36:25.153 --> 36:26.719
well done.

36:26.721 --> 36:30.431
Jimmie helped a lot.

36:30.433 --> 36:32.831
Was Jimmie um, ATF?

36:32.833 --> 36:37.633
No no, no, we uh,
we met at a meeting in D.C.

36:38.818 --> 36:40.738
She had met me at
another one somewhere.

36:43.618 --> 36:44.863
Do we get to meet the doctors?

36:44.865 --> 36:46.687
Is there a hospital nearby?

36:46.689 --> 36:48.224
Oh, world class.

36:48.226 --> 36:49.729
Dr. Bellmaraz?

36:51.778 --> 36:52.577
Yeah.

36:59.969 --> 37:01.313
Dad, what's the prognosis?

37:03.201 --> 37:04.736
While we're having dessert?

37:04.738 --> 37:05.793
I'll tell ya later.

37:13.825 --> 37:14.625
Good?

37:16.513 --> 37:21.313
Chickens, rabbits, and
even if I do say so myself,

37:22.145 --> 37:24.800
a decent, very serious garden.

37:24.802 --> 37:29.344
Vegetables, herbs, flowers.

37:29.346 --> 37:31.071
Oh, look at that.

37:31.073 --> 37:31.873
A little uh.

37:33.953 --> 37:34.719
What?

37:34.721 --> 37:35.806
Nothing, honey.

37:35.808 --> 37:37.471
Yeah right, what?

37:37.473 --> 37:39.104
I just, I broke
up, thinkin' of Hugh

37:39.106 --> 37:41.247
raising chickens and
rabbits, that's all.

37:41.249 --> 37:43.135
Since when?

37:43.137 --> 37:44.446
Year and a half.

37:44.448 --> 37:46.751
Rabbit meat's the
leanest there is.

37:46.753 --> 37:48.639
Wait, you eat them?

37:48.641 --> 37:51.455
Yeah, tomorrow night
we're gonna have stifado.

37:51.457 --> 37:54.399
Ooh, I'd go anorexic
before I eat a rabbit.

37:54.401 --> 37:55.457
Lu.

37:57.409 --> 37:59.968
Dad, is, is that
for your condition?

37:59.970 --> 38:01.088
No.

38:01.090 --> 38:03.455
Well um, can we
discuss your health now?

38:03.457 --> 38:04.257
Shoot.

38:09.089 --> 38:10.655
What do you know?

38:10.657 --> 38:13.823
What do you wanna do, I
mean, what should we know?

38:13.825 --> 38:15.551
That you're loved.

38:15.553 --> 38:17.727
Hugh, we're all worried.

38:17.729 --> 38:19.199
Don't worry.

38:19.201 --> 38:20.895
That's why we
drove here, together.

38:20.897 --> 38:24.063
Mom said you called, um, that
a doctor had suggested that...

38:24.065 --> 38:25.153
That I'm getting old.

38:26.273 --> 38:28.097
That's not exactly
how we understood it.

38:29.026 --> 38:31.105
How did you understand it?

38:32.193 --> 38:34.431
That your kidneys are failing,

38:34.433 --> 38:37.055
that you're on strong
prescription medicine.

38:37.057 --> 38:41.086
Sometimes it hurts,
I don't feel good.

38:41.088 --> 38:42.079
Dialysis?

38:42.081 --> 38:44.194
No, not yet, Marty.

38:50.242 --> 38:52.064
Dad, are you dying?

38:52.066 --> 38:53.599
Honey.

38:53.601 --> 38:54.975
Are you?

38:54.977 --> 38:55.777
Every day.

39:03.201 --> 39:04.223
Tasha.

39:04.225 --> 39:04.992
What?

39:06.689 --> 39:09.023
Dad, can you just tell
me, how you're feeling,

39:09.025 --> 39:10.271
how you're doing?

39:10.273 --> 39:12.319
Dad, can you just tell
me how sick you are?

39:12.321 --> 39:13.793
Okay, that's enough.

39:14.688 --> 39:16.671
We're all exhausted.

39:16.673 --> 39:20.479
You had me on check anyway,
you checkmated me, see?

39:20.481 --> 39:22.079
Oh, I did.

39:22.081 --> 39:26.495
Come on, come on old man,
let's go beddy-bye, sleepy head.

39:26.497 --> 39:27.839
- Come on.
- Here we go.

39:27.841 --> 39:29.121
Come on, okay.

39:31.809 --> 39:35.327
I don't know if he's
gonna make it up the stairs.

39:35.329 --> 39:36.543
I'll help ya.

39:36.545 --> 39:37.630
Dad, I really
hope you come back down

39:37.632 --> 39:39.073
so we can understand
this better.

39:42.337 --> 39:43.137
Every time.

39:45.153 --> 39:47.071
Why are you angry
at your father?

39:47.073 --> 39:49.951
Sweetheart, your grandpa
was a much different man

39:49.953 --> 39:51.455
when I knew him.

39:51.457 --> 39:52.990
We just need to
get to the bottom

39:52.992 --> 39:54.657
of his condition, the truth.

39:56.033 --> 39:58.465
He's got a way of slowly but
surely avoiding the truth.

40:00.449 --> 40:03.391
Um, when can I
go to get online?

40:03.393 --> 40:04.447
Not tonight, honey.

40:04.449 --> 40:05.951
I'll drive you tomorrow.

40:05.953 --> 40:06.879
You know
what, why don't we

40:06.881 --> 40:07.871
get you ready for bed, come on.

40:07.873 --> 40:09.279
Now?

40:09.281 --> 40:10.594
You can read a book,
you've got a whole library.

40:12.033 --> 40:13.183
Can I ask you a question?

40:13.185 --> 40:14.689
- Mm.
- Sure, honey.

40:16.032 --> 40:17.121
Don't avoid the truth.

40:18.912 --> 40:20.545
Are you two getting
back together?

40:24.801 --> 40:28.063
Sweetheart, we're
workin' on it.

40:28.065 --> 40:28.865
Yeah.

40:30.241 --> 40:31.905
You just need
to know that we love you.

40:32.961 --> 40:34.594
Hey, more than
anything in the world.

40:35.905 --> 40:36.705
Love you too.

40:37.953 --> 40:39.359
I wanna know what's
gonna happen.

40:39.361 --> 40:42.370
Of course, come on baby,
let's get you to bed.

40:51.137 --> 40:54.497
Sh, sh,
sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.

40:55.714 --> 40:57.247
He's breathing's gotten poor.

40:57.249 --> 41:01.535
Oh, I know,
I know, I'm scared for him.

41:01.537 --> 41:02.497
I know, B.

41:06.241 --> 41:10.463
Tasha and Marty are having
troubles with each other.

41:10.465 --> 41:13.247
It's conspicuous, I
noticed it immediately.

41:13.249 --> 41:15.297
I mean, she said they
drove here together.

41:16.416 --> 41:17.249
What about Luana?

41:18.977 --> 41:21.023
She's reacting
a lot of different ways,

41:21.025 --> 41:23.071
not all of 'em good.

41:23.073 --> 41:25.759
But Tasha has been just
seized by the furies,

41:25.761 --> 41:27.168
that's why she so.

41:29.185 --> 41:31.585
Why does everything
happen at once, huh?

41:32.801 --> 41:33.601
Huh?

41:35.074 --> 41:38.143
I have something I
wanted to say to you.

41:38.145 --> 41:39.550
What?

41:39.552 --> 41:41.119
Oh god, oh Hugh,

41:41.121 --> 41:42.334
- oh no.
- No, no, no, no, no,

41:42.336 --> 41:44.641
I'm okay, I'm fine,
in fact, I'm better.

41:45.505 --> 41:47.230
I've been craving this moment

41:47.232 --> 41:50.655
and I just didn't expect it
to materialize so quickly.

41:50.657 --> 41:52.095
What are you?

41:52.097 --> 41:56.673
I want you to come back, I
want us to be together again.

41:57.761 --> 41:59.199
Oh god, you are much
worse, aren't you?

41:59.201 --> 42:01.503
Oh, it has nothing to
do with my health, I just,

42:01.505 --> 42:04.223
with whatever time we have left,

42:04.225 --> 42:05.985
I wanna spend it
with each other.

42:08.256 --> 42:09.089
I love you.

42:10.689 --> 42:12.865
I've always loved you, always.

42:16.097 --> 42:18.176
Whatever has happened,
whatever will happen,

42:18.178 --> 42:20.863
I have never and I never
will make a fool of you,

42:20.865 --> 42:23.775
but I won't let you make
a fool of yourself either.

42:23.777 --> 42:25.247
Is that what you
think I'm doing?

42:25.249 --> 42:26.686
You're
still drinking.

42:26.688 --> 42:28.318
Two years, I've not...

42:28.320 --> 42:29.503
Don't, don't.

42:29.505 --> 42:31.296
Do you know how many
times I've heard that?

42:33.538 --> 42:35.134
I mean, I'm happy for
you, if it's true,

42:35.136 --> 42:36.514
I hope it goes on and on.

42:39.649 --> 42:41.119
Thank you for the
prayer at dinner,

42:41.121 --> 42:43.070
from the bottom of my heart.

42:43.072 --> 42:47.872
And from that same place
, no, thank you.

42:53.089 --> 42:54.017
How sick are you?

42:56.448 --> 42:58.594
God willing, I'll
tell ya tomorrow.

43:40.289 --> 43:42.430
She's so sweet.

44:40.833 --> 44:45.249
Marty.

44:46.177 --> 44:48.223
We can't, we can't.

44:56.512 --> 44:58.368
You want me to
sleep on the chair?

44:59.904 --> 45:01.473
You want me to tell
you where to sleep?

45:02.817 --> 45:06.273
Jesus Christ.

45:15.169 --> 45:16.831
What I want is for
you to remind yourself

45:16.833 --> 45:19.807
that what you say and do has
an affect on my daughter.

45:19.809 --> 45:20.833
Our daughter.

45:21.921 --> 45:23.455
Our.

45:23.457 --> 45:24.609
Thanks so much.

45:26.625 --> 45:28.415
I'm aware of that.

45:28.417 --> 45:31.006
She sounds like trash,
it's embarrassing.

45:31.008 --> 45:32.159
What do you think my
mother is gonna think...

45:32.161 --> 45:33.888
She's imitating you.

45:34.816 --> 45:36.286
Marty, she was sneaking.

45:36.288 --> 45:38.590
In the street with who knows
who all hours of the night.

45:38.592 --> 45:40.031
And I'm to blame for that?

45:40.033 --> 45:41.695
Sure as shit didn't seem
to bother you at the moment.

45:41.697 --> 45:43.263
You didn't even
mention it to me.

45:43.265 --> 45:46.143
More importantly, you
didn't say a word to her.

45:46.145 --> 45:49.473
She's you daughter, and
you just ignored it.

45:50.784 --> 45:53.758
Then, the ever Mr. Clever
shows up, and what,

45:53.760 --> 45:56.159
you decided to use it
to cut a deal with her.

45:56.161 --> 45:57.439
Like you were
selling real estate.

45:57.441 --> 45:58.785
Which you went along with.

46:04.065 --> 46:05.503
I'm not gonna fight.

46:05.505 --> 46:06.398
'Cause even you
know when you're wrong.

46:06.400 --> 46:07.550
- Wrong?
- Yes.

46:07.552 --> 46:10.017
Wrong, what a bitchin'
tattoo on her back.

46:15.777 --> 46:17.215
You're doin' such a bang up job

46:17.217 --> 46:18.526
- with our daughter.
- Oh, nice.

46:18.528 --> 46:19.713
Teaching her.

46:24.353 --> 46:27.295
Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh, it's okay.

46:27.297 --> 46:28.510
- Right.
- You got it.

46:28.512 --> 46:30.494
Guess what, Luana
is still suffering,

46:30.496 --> 46:31.743
she's still confused.

46:31.745 --> 46:33.182
Why do you think that is?

46:33.184 --> 46:34.527
Her delirious mother.

46:34.529 --> 46:37.953
No, Martin, face it.

46:38.784 --> 46:40.702
It is her lying, cheating...

46:40.704 --> 46:43.742
Bullshit, blinded,
one-way mind, just shut it.

46:43.744 --> 46:45.854
Oh, you are in my dad's house.

46:45.856 --> 46:47.361
He is dying.

46:48.480 --> 46:50.239
Luana's having some
sort of breakdown.

46:50.241 --> 46:51.166
You're having a breakdown.

46:51.168 --> 46:52.318
Fuck off.

46:52.320 --> 46:54.175
Calling me delirious,
no, no, no,

46:54.177 --> 46:56.767
you don't get to do that,
you don't, not this time.

46:56.769 --> 46:58.463
You don't get to just wave
your hands and walk away

46:58.465 --> 47:01.887
not talking because things
get tough or uncomfortable.

47:01.889 --> 47:05.505
You deal with it,
Martin, deal with it.

47:08.097 --> 47:09.185
You're driving us away.

47:10.305 --> 47:12.542
You're driving our
daughter and me away

47:12.544 --> 47:14.656
because you can't make a choice.

47:17.601 --> 47:18.561
Make a choice.

47:19.681 --> 47:20.865
Make a choice.

47:22.017 --> 47:22.879
Make a choice!

47:22.881 --> 47:23.839
Stop.

47:27.840 --> 47:29.854
What are you gonna
do, huh, huh, Martin?

47:33.760 --> 47:34.593
I'm gonna stop.

47:38.273 --> 47:39.678
I'm gonna quit.

47:39.680 --> 47:40.480
What?

47:42.369 --> 47:47.169
I'm gonna leave.

48:07.968 --> 48:12.607
We should, I know.

48:12.609 --> 48:13.632
I know, baby.

49:22.368 --> 49:23.871
Honey.

49:23.873 --> 49:26.047
It's okay, sh, sh, sh, sh.

49:26.049 --> 49:28.479
Bad dream.

49:28.481 --> 49:29.566
- Bad.
- What, what, what, baby,

49:29.568 --> 49:30.878
what, what, what?

49:30.880 --> 49:32.446
It was um, it was
the guy with the truck,

49:32.448 --> 49:36.415
and the tattoos around
his eyes, he killed her.

49:36.417 --> 49:38.494
The girl who wrote with
lipstick on the mirror.

49:38.496 --> 49:40.190
What'd she say?

49:40.192 --> 49:41.630
Dad, please.

49:41.632 --> 49:42.657
I'll warm some milk.

49:44.032 --> 49:44.961
It's okay.

49:49.024 --> 49:49.792
It's okay.

49:53.920 --> 49:56.542
What's all that
stuff about a truck?

49:56.544 --> 49:59.614
Oh, it was something
that happened on the way.

49:59.616 --> 50:03.422
She saw something,
said she saw something,

50:03.424 --> 50:04.449
it was alarming.

50:05.985 --> 50:10.752
She's
hurting, me and her.

50:15.969 --> 50:18.078
Tasha will
get her to sleep.

50:18.080 --> 50:21.600
Do you think this is about
that lipstick on the mirror?

50:22.656 --> 50:23.457
No, no.

50:27.489 --> 50:29.376
It's about Tasha and me.

50:31.041 --> 50:33.184
We've been separated
for a couple months now.

50:34.817 --> 50:36.511
Three to be exact.

50:36.513 --> 50:40.639
And we weren't gonna, we
were gonna not talk about it

50:40.641 --> 50:41.952
under the circumstances.

50:43.200 --> 50:45.025
But, Luana knew.

50:45.985 --> 50:47.422
Yeah, Luana of course knew.

50:47.424 --> 50:49.694
And I stupidly talked
her into not telling you

50:49.696 --> 50:52.384
because of something
that she did.

50:53.408 --> 50:54.912
But we're broke it off and,

50:59.808 --> 51:03.230
looks like it'll
probably be permanent.

51:06.784 --> 51:09.118
I'm sorry to hear that.

51:09.120 --> 51:10.337
I'm so sorry.

51:40.224 --> 51:41.278
Kiddo.

51:52.320 --> 51:53.280
It's over.

51:55.904 --> 51:57.281
It's really over.

51:58.401 --> 52:01.183
I'm so
sorry, I'm so sorry.

52:06.689 --> 52:11.489
Hugh, at the risk of being
even more of an asshole

52:12.192 --> 52:13.120
than I've already been,

52:16.257 --> 52:17.697
do you have anything to drink?

52:34.304 --> 52:35.104
You sure?

52:36.480 --> 52:39.487
Sure, I'm sure that
if I was young enough

52:39.489 --> 52:41.822
I'd probably try
to kick your ass.

52:41.824 --> 52:43.425
That was pretty ugly up there.

52:45.312 --> 52:48.225
She was hitting me, I,

52:50.720 --> 52:51.520
never again.

52:52.737 --> 52:54.624
Go ahead, open it,
it's good bourbon.

53:03.585 --> 53:05.982
I'm not young enough.

53:05.984 --> 53:08.670
It has nothin' to do
with you or Tasha,

53:08.672 --> 53:11.614
I'm two years sober, man.

53:11.616 --> 53:14.049
You got a lotta nerve
asking me for a drink.

53:16.448 --> 53:17.793
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

53:18.689 --> 53:19.840
Well tell that to Tasha.

53:22.816 --> 53:23.616
Ah?

53:24.736 --> 53:25.600
You're sober?

53:29.792 --> 53:33.696
Once a week I go
into town and shop,

53:34.624 --> 53:36.734
get a haircut, see a doctor.

53:36.736 --> 53:40.288
And the last thing I do is
I go by the liquor store

53:41.184 --> 53:42.558
and I pick up a pint of booze,

53:42.560 --> 53:44.510
I keep it in the
cabinet right there.

53:44.512 --> 53:48.158
And it lives with me
here, three, four days,

53:48.160 --> 53:51.614
and then one night I take
it out and I smash it

53:51.616 --> 53:56.416
against a tree, a rock,
tractor, I destroy it.

53:57.568 --> 54:00.190
And as I do that, I howl
at the moon like a dog,

54:00.192 --> 54:03.775
and that coordinated
effort proves to me

54:03.777 --> 54:06.334
that I am in control of my life.

54:06.336 --> 54:09.921
I don't drink alcohol.

54:11.489 --> 54:14.878
And I know that may sound
like some demented ritual

54:14.880 --> 54:19.614
of an unbalanced individual,
but then stupidity

54:19.616 --> 54:22.942
is the most natural of
all human qualities.

54:22.944 --> 54:23.904
Like body sweat.

54:25.025 --> 54:26.976
That's your message
from the holy land?

54:28.288 --> 54:29.152
Amen, sister.

54:38.272 --> 54:39.774
Since we're doing revelations
night on the mountain,

54:39.776 --> 54:41.662
why don't you just tell
us how sick you are, Dad.

54:41.664 --> 54:44.638
My kidneys are in a
permanent state of anarchy.

54:44.640 --> 54:47.167
My liver, however,
God only knows why,

54:47.169 --> 54:49.630
is steadfast, my
ticker's strong.

54:49.632 --> 54:52.254
So basically, you
lied to get us here.

54:52.256 --> 54:53.470
No.

54:53.472 --> 54:55.262
When can we meet
with doctor um...

54:55.264 --> 54:56.062
Belmaraz.

54:56.064 --> 54:56.959
Belmaraz?

54:56.961 --> 54:57.854
When she's back in town.

54:57.856 --> 54:59.551
She, I thought it was a, oh,

54:59.553 --> 55:00.511
when is she back?

55:00.513 --> 55:02.240
Any day now, I'll call her.

55:03.393 --> 55:05.854
Well, at least one
purpose was served.

55:05.856 --> 55:07.774
Hugh, I can leave now if you...

55:07.776 --> 55:08.670
Brilliant, that's good.

55:08.672 --> 55:10.399
Why don't you do that, Marty?

55:10.401 --> 55:12.670
Why don't you drink and drive
at night in the mountains.

55:12.672 --> 55:13.662
- Sh, sh, sh, sh.
- That's a really

55:13.664 --> 55:14.558
- good thought, smart.
- Sh!

55:14.560 --> 55:16.256
Could you guys stop this.

55:18.176 --> 55:19.966
How's Luana feeling
about all this?

55:19.968 --> 55:21.823
Luana wants to go into
town and text her friends,

55:21.825 --> 55:23.934
that's all she wants, period.

55:23.936 --> 55:26.910
She obviously knows
about us breaking up.

55:26.912 --> 55:28.862
She honored it by getting
a tattoo on her back.

55:28.864 --> 55:30.846
Of what?

55:30.848 --> 55:32.862
Oh, you know,
I would never say

55:32.864 --> 55:34.334
that I liked you
better drunk, but...

55:34.336 --> 55:36.670
What, it's on her
back, what is it?

55:36.672 --> 55:37.662
A bird.

55:37.664 --> 55:38.718
What do you mean a bird?

55:38.720 --> 55:40.350
What, an eagle, a parrot, what...

55:40.352 --> 55:42.078
- Dad, what does it matter?
- A seagull.

55:42.080 --> 55:43.262
12-year-old girl.

55:43.264 --> 55:45.022
Well somebody
oughta go to jail.

55:45.024 --> 55:46.462
Who, maybe Luana?

55:46.464 --> 55:47.551
Mom.

55:47.553 --> 55:49.886
Well, it's her back.

55:49.888 --> 55:51.230
She's 12 years old.

55:51.232 --> 55:53.374
It's her back.

55:53.376 --> 55:55.998
Okay, well, she also
snuck out last night.

55:56.000 --> 55:57.470
Last night?

55:57.472 --> 55:59.582
Yes, she and her friend
and some boy I don't know

55:59.584 --> 56:01.342
snuck out and they
snuck back in.

56:01.344 --> 56:02.560
You caught her?

56:04.288 --> 56:07.262
She's already on
probation for foul language.

56:07.264 --> 56:09.150
And the
lipstick on the mirror?

56:09.152 --> 56:11.710
I don't know, that's even,
that's even more disturbing,

56:11.712 --> 56:14.109
- I, I don't...
- Mystery truck and lipstick.

56:14.111 --> 56:14.912
No good.

56:15.936 --> 56:16.991
Shut up, Marty.

56:18.304 --> 56:19.518
She was wearing lipstick.

56:19.520 --> 56:21.374
Well maybe, could it
have been in her purse

56:21.376 --> 56:23.232
or maybe in her suitcase?

56:27.232 --> 56:28.032
Yeah.

56:48.096 --> 56:49.502
I'm not gonna go
through her things,

56:49.504 --> 56:50.752
I'm just gonna ask her.

56:56.960 --> 56:57.760
Goodnight.

57:01.151 --> 57:03.232
Will I see you in the morning?

58:43.456 --> 58:45.376
Son of a bitch.

59:50.368 --> 59:51.678
Here you go.

59:51.680 --> 59:52.480
Okay.

01:00:04.128 --> 01:00:07.840
Edward, Ed, Eddie.

01:00:17.217 --> 01:00:20.222
Come on
Sybil, come on girl, hey.

01:00:20.224 --> 01:00:22.366
- Hey, how are ya?
- Hey there, Aubrey.

01:00:22.368 --> 01:00:23.678
Good
morning, Sybil.

01:00:52.223 --> 01:00:54.078
Here you go.

01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:55.134
Oh.

01:00:55.136 --> 01:00:56.798
Hey, good morning, Luana.

01:00:56.800 --> 01:00:58.110
Hey, beauty.

01:00:58.112 --> 01:00:58.974
Good morning.

01:00:58.976 --> 01:01:00.702
- You hungry?
- Yeah.

01:01:00.704 --> 01:01:02.973
Um, is Dad okay?

01:01:02.975 --> 01:01:05.215
In the pink, he's fine.

01:01:05.217 --> 01:01:06.654
Wanna scramble some eggs?

01:01:06.656 --> 01:01:07.869
Yeah.

01:01:07.871 --> 01:01:09.374
Yeah, I told you that
you could scramble eggs.

01:01:09.376 --> 01:01:11.454
She said, "No, she can't,

01:01:11.456 --> 01:01:13.280
"but even if she
could, she wouldn't."

01:01:15.328 --> 01:01:16.798
I hear you wanna get online.

01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:17.982
Yes.

01:01:17.984 --> 01:01:19.101
Okay, so at the
bottom of the drive,

01:01:19.103 --> 01:01:20.286
you're gonna turn left.

01:01:20.288 --> 01:01:21.566
And after awhile there's
a Mexican restaurant

01:01:21.568 --> 01:01:23.838
all by itself on the
highway called Mona's.

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:24.734
Thank you.

01:01:24.736 --> 01:01:26.013
Morning.

01:01:26.015 --> 01:01:27.454
Hi.

01:01:27.456 --> 01:01:30.302
Sweetheart, were you able
to get back to sleep okay?

01:01:30.304 --> 01:01:31.773
Yes, I'm, I'm sorry for...

01:01:31.775 --> 01:01:33.086
Oh, honey.

01:01:33.088 --> 01:01:35.517
Nothing worse than a
nightmare in a strange bedroom.

01:01:35.519 --> 01:01:38.176
Well, I beg to differ.

01:01:40.128 --> 01:01:41.662
Yeah?

01:01:41.664 --> 01:01:43.264
Yeah.

01:01:44.768 --> 01:01:46.365
Scramble, scramble,
scramble, scramble.

01:01:46.367 --> 01:01:47.166
One, two, three, four,

01:01:47.168 --> 01:01:47.997
one, two, three, four,

01:01:47.999 --> 01:01:49.309
one, two, three, four.

01:02:03.455 --> 01:02:05.920
I think um, maybe
you should go.

01:02:09.632 --> 01:02:11.712
I can drive Luana and
my mom back tomorrow.

01:02:15.712 --> 01:02:18.432
Rent a car, take a
bus, catch a train.

01:02:20.288 --> 01:02:21.280
I know how.

01:02:25.952 --> 01:02:27.134
Goodbye, Bettye Sue.

01:02:27.136 --> 01:02:28.286
Take
care of yourself.

01:03:19.648 --> 01:03:24.448
I'm gonna pick up
some.

01:04:24.416 --> 01:04:25.216
Hey.

01:04:29.216 --> 01:04:30.559
I know you're upset.

01:04:35.168 --> 01:04:37.279
I just want you to know
how much I love you.

01:04:41.055 --> 01:04:42.336
I know, Daddy.

01:04:48.352 --> 01:04:50.784
Hey, you've never ridden
a train before have you?

01:04:52.511 --> 01:04:53.502
No.

01:04:53.504 --> 01:04:54.303
No.

01:04:56.831 --> 01:04:57.952
Well, you know what?

01:04:59.264 --> 01:05:00.640
I used to love to ride.

01:05:02.879 --> 01:05:04.640
I can't wait to take
a trip with you.

01:05:07.712 --> 01:05:11.613
When Grandma Marcie and
I, and Dad used to go

01:05:11.615 --> 01:05:13.312
from Eugene to Los Angeles,

01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:18.559
I would sleep in the upper
bunk, it was so much fun.

01:05:20.864 --> 01:05:23.552
And I would go to the last car,

01:05:26.464 --> 01:05:29.792
stand there and I'd just
watch the track disappear.

01:05:32.927 --> 01:05:35.456
The conductor would
let me stand there

01:05:36.575 --> 01:05:38.816
and I'd just watch
the tracks disappear,

01:05:40.256 --> 01:05:43.424
around a bend or
on a straightaway,

01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:48.382
and think about all the
places that I'd been and,

01:05:48.384 --> 01:05:50.077
I couldn't wait to
see where we'd land

01:05:50.079 --> 01:05:52.095
when the train stopped
and we all got off.

01:05:55.935 --> 01:05:57.440
Sweetheart, I'm sorry.

01:05:58.559 --> 01:06:00.318
You're gonna see
me a lot more now

01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:03.327
than you have in that
last few weeks, I promise.

01:06:04.256 --> 01:06:07.871
By phone, text, Skype.

01:06:13.727 --> 01:06:15.008
We'll take a train trip.

01:06:16.576 --> 01:06:17.375
Good.

01:06:19.647 --> 01:06:21.088
You are my angel.

01:06:22.719 --> 01:06:24.381
You're the only one
that I've ever met,

01:06:24.383 --> 01:06:26.528
the only one I ever will meet.

01:06:28.511 --> 01:06:31.902
Promise me you'll
be good, always.

01:06:31.904 --> 01:06:33.662
- I promise, Daddy.
- I love you.

01:07:32.096 --> 01:07:33.213
Thank you.

01:08:12.287 --> 01:08:13.183
You okay?

01:08:14.655 --> 01:08:15.551
I'm fine.

01:08:16.703 --> 01:08:19.453
You wanna go home,
I mean to my place?

01:08:19.455 --> 01:08:22.367
Um, I wanna go to
Mona's, get online.

01:08:23.839 --> 01:08:24.671
How far is it?

01:08:25.567 --> 01:08:26.973
Do they have wifi?

01:08:26.975 --> 01:08:28.191
Yep, hang on.

01:08:46.559 --> 01:08:48.127
Look at how they strut.

01:08:49.055 --> 01:08:51.933
Hm, and some of 'em look lost.

01:08:51.935 --> 01:08:53.790
Where am I?

01:08:53.792 --> 01:08:55.103
Where am I going?

01:08:56.831 --> 01:08:58.045
I know you like chicken, buddy,

01:08:58.046 --> 01:09:01.117
but some of 'em seem
to love life so much.

01:09:01.118 --> 01:09:02.589
Hey.

01:09:02.591 --> 01:09:03.328
Oh, hi.

01:09:04.607 --> 01:09:05.821
I asked Tasha if she
wanted to check out the place

01:09:05.823 --> 01:09:07.421
but she just wanted to
hang out in the house.

01:09:07.424 --> 01:09:08.828
She's pretty much a city girl.

01:09:08.831 --> 01:09:10.399
Yeah, me too
before I met Hugh.

01:09:11.231 --> 01:09:13.501
Where, where did you meet him?

01:09:13.502 --> 01:09:16.093
AA, D.C. and Charlottesville.

01:09:16.095 --> 01:09:17.982
Ah, we lived in
D.C. a long time.

01:09:17.984 --> 01:09:19.549
That's pretty much where
we raised our kids.

01:09:19.551 --> 01:09:21.725
Yeah, Hugh told
me all about it.

01:09:21.728 --> 01:09:24.350
And, I know how much he
misses you, and family.

01:09:27.103 --> 01:09:28.638
How's he doin', Jimmie?

01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:30.527
He's superb, how 'bout you?

01:09:32.319 --> 01:09:33.661
Good.

01:09:33.662 --> 01:09:35.133
Is your last name Belmaraz?

01:09:35.135 --> 01:09:35.935
No.

01:09:38.270 --> 01:09:39.484
How are you doin'?

01:09:59.775 --> 01:10:02.461
Do you know the password?

01:10:02.463 --> 01:10:03.263
Cantina.

01:10:05.503 --> 01:10:06.750
Thanks.

01:10:20.384 --> 01:10:22.237
Please, I need to make a
call, it's an emergency.

01:10:22.239 --> 01:10:23.773
No, no.

01:10:23.775 --> 01:10:25.407
It's a matter
of life and death.

01:10:28.543 --> 01:10:29.343
Si.

01:10:30.815 --> 01:10:34.717
Hugh,.

01:10:34.719 --> 01:10:37.470
Si,.

01:10:37.472 --> 01:10:38.975
Si, si, si.

01:10:48.703 --> 01:10:50.144
Thanks, Grandpy.

01:11:12.639 --> 01:11:14.077
We're sorry,
you have reached a number

01:11:14.079 --> 01:11:16.253
that has been disconnected
or is no longer in use.

01:11:16.255 --> 01:11:18.078
Guys,
put the vehicles in position,

01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:19.935
trucks and police cars.

01:11:27.743 --> 01:11:29.502
Come on
guys, we gotta shoot.

01:11:43.679 --> 01:11:46.526
Thank you, come right out.

01:11:46.528 --> 01:11:49.149
John, are you
ready, we gotta shoot.

01:11:49.151 --> 01:11:50.301
Guys, talk to me,

01:11:50.303 --> 01:11:51.903
are you in position?

01:11:52.927 --> 01:11:55.326
Guys, we got
vehicles in position.

01:12:00.575 --> 01:12:02.495
Bring the back hooks in.

01:12:09.695 --> 01:12:10.975
All right, guys, put yours up.

01:12:12.959 --> 01:12:14.941
Very good, let's roll sound.

01:12:14.943 --> 01:12:15.933
Let's roll sound.

01:12:15.935 --> 01:12:17.246
And roll camera.

01:12:17.248 --> 01:12:18.525
Let's roll camera.

01:12:18.527 --> 01:12:19.773
Rolling.

01:12:22.143 --> 01:12:24.477
We're set
then, call it to her.

01:12:24.479 --> 01:12:25.309
Action.

01:12:25.311 --> 01:12:26.684
Action!

01:12:50.655 --> 01:12:51.709
Let
me see your hands!

01:12:51.711 --> 01:12:52.989
Drop the weapon.

01:12:52.991 --> 01:12:54.173
Drop the weapon!

01:12:54.175 --> 01:12:55.261
Drop
your weapon, now!

01:12:55.263 --> 01:12:56.831
- Drop the weapon, now!
- Do it!

01:12:58.015 --> 01:12:59.005
Do it now.

01:12:59.007 --> 01:13:00.188
Back off!

01:13:00.190 --> 01:13:01.374
- Drop the weapon.
- Drop your weapon.

01:13:01.376 --> 01:13:02.557
Back
off or she's dead!

01:13:02.559 --> 01:13:03.453
Drop it.

01:13:03.455 --> 01:13:04.863
And that's a cut!

01:13:11.519 --> 01:13:14.079
Well, we still have it though.

01:13:15.646 --> 01:13:17.022
Did you write on the
mirror with lipstick?

01:13:17.024 --> 01:13:17.917
What?

01:13:17.919 --> 01:13:19.101
Did you write on the mirror

01:13:19.103 --> 01:13:20.221
that he broke your
teeth and nose?

01:13:20.223 --> 01:13:21.213
Luana.

01:13:21.215 --> 01:13:22.525
Super.

01:13:22.527 --> 01:13:24.188
Worked out great.

01:13:24.190 --> 01:13:25.629
Was he gonna kill you?

01:13:25.631 --> 01:13:26.749
Is this a gag?

01:13:26.751 --> 01:13:28.957
Mistaken, mistaken identity.

01:13:28.959 --> 01:13:32.413
Hey, are you following me, hm?

01:13:32.415 --> 01:13:35.197
Are you following me, huh?

01:13:35.199 --> 01:13:37.917
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, we're
old friends, remember me?

01:13:37.919 --> 01:13:38.751
I'm an actor.

01:13:40.543 --> 01:13:41.792
Well, that's weird.

01:13:45.567 --> 01:13:46.815
Don't leave her.

01:13:47.839 --> 01:13:48.639
I won't.

01:13:49.727 --> 01:13:50.528
Who?

01:13:51.519 --> 01:13:53.245
Everybody's going away.

01:13:53.247 --> 01:13:54.623
I'm not, I'm here with ya.

01:13:57.248 --> 01:13:59.101
What's going on?

01:13:59.103 --> 01:14:00.829
Oh they're making a
movie, sure, great,

01:14:00.831 --> 01:14:03.391
but I, I wanna know,

01:14:05.215 --> 01:14:07.327
I wanna know why my
parents are breaking up.

01:14:08.223 --> 01:14:09.663
I can't tell what,

01:14:11.007 --> 01:14:13.725
I don't know, I
don't know anymore.

01:14:13.727 --> 01:14:16.988
It's not easy, Luana,
it's not graceful,

01:14:16.990 --> 01:14:18.653
and they're making a movie but,

01:14:18.655 --> 01:14:20.509
the girl's the nose,
her teeth aren't broken.

01:14:20.511 --> 01:14:22.557
I mean that guy's
not gonna kill her,

01:14:22.559 --> 01:14:24.511
he's just an actor
playing his part.

01:14:26.399 --> 01:14:30.463
My friend, Jalla,
is going away.

01:14:32.159 --> 01:14:34.399
She's really leaving me, really.

01:14:36.063 --> 01:14:38.045
My best friend in
the whole wide world

01:14:38.047 --> 01:14:39.871
and there's nothing
I can do about it.

01:14:41.759 --> 01:14:43.391
My parents are
really breaking up,

01:14:44.959 --> 01:14:46.559
and I can't do
anything about it.

01:14:47.679 --> 01:14:49.791
You can't control
other people's lives.

01:14:52.255 --> 01:14:53.023
Why?

01:14:54.367 --> 01:14:57.693
That's just the way
the world is made.

01:14:57.695 --> 01:15:01.023
I mean, there's no guarantees,
you never know, ever.

01:15:02.239 --> 01:15:05.629
You know, I, I wanted
Bettye Sue, Grammy,

01:15:05.631 --> 01:15:07.615
to come be with me.

01:15:08.990 --> 01:15:12.992
I could see us, I can see
us together forever but,

01:15:14.399 --> 01:15:18.813
she can't, she
doesn't, she won't.

01:15:18.815 --> 01:15:20.350
I mean you just, you never know.

01:15:21.823 --> 01:15:23.228
That's sad.

01:15:23.230 --> 01:15:25.023
Well, it's not happy.

01:15:26.110 --> 01:15:28.350
I want things to be happy.

01:15:28.352 --> 01:15:30.685
I wanna know what
that would be like.

01:15:30.687 --> 01:15:33.950
You'll make things
so happy, so groovy.

01:15:37.630 --> 01:15:39.037
How would I?

01:15:39.039 --> 01:15:40.445
Well it's not even a
question of how would you,

01:15:40.447 --> 01:15:43.997
you just, you go with the
flow, which you learn to love.

01:15:43.999 --> 01:15:48.029
I mean, when you're young,
you dream of the future.

01:15:48.031 --> 01:15:50.268
When you're old, you
dream of the past.

01:15:50.270 --> 01:15:51.709
Hey, making a movie, huh?

01:15:51.711 --> 01:15:54.397
Yeah, you saw what
I wrote on the mirror?

01:15:54.399 --> 01:15:56.541
Uh, yeah.

01:15:56.543 --> 01:15:58.687
Props or set dressing
didn't wipe it off.

01:16:01.438 --> 01:16:02.941
It's just a flick, girl.

01:16:02.943 --> 01:16:05.276
I'm so sorry
for the confusion.

01:16:05.278 --> 01:16:06.524
Please accept my apologies.

01:16:06.526 --> 01:16:08.541
Yeah, I hope we
didn't ruin the take.

01:16:08.543 --> 01:16:10.941
No, we got exactly
what we wanted.

01:16:10.943 --> 01:16:11.965
Well, if you wanna come back

01:16:11.967 --> 01:16:13.405
we've got a couple more scenes.

01:16:13.407 --> 01:16:16.093
Yeah, and then come
to the wrap party, eh?

01:16:16.095 --> 01:16:17.565
Uh, we're, we're,
we're gonna go home

01:16:17.567 --> 01:16:20.190
and see what the family
wants to do and then,

01:16:20.192 --> 01:16:21.983
or see what Luana wants to do.

01:16:23.007 --> 01:16:24.415
And, thank you.

01:16:25.438 --> 01:16:26.877
Thank you.

01:16:36.895 --> 01:16:38.397
That could
be a lot of fun.

01:16:38.399 --> 01:16:39.677
Yeah.

01:16:44.415 --> 01:16:45.215
Thanks.

01:16:50.559 --> 01:16:54.365
You kept saying back
there, "Don't leave her."

01:16:54.367 --> 01:16:58.909
Who is that, her?

01:16:58.911 --> 01:17:01.087
Is that your friend, Jalla?

01:17:02.270 --> 01:17:07.070
Listen to me, you have
things inside of you,

01:17:08.191 --> 01:17:09.471
nobody knows what
you've got but you.

01:17:10.623 --> 01:17:12.637
That's the one thing
you can be sure of.

01:17:12.639 --> 01:17:15.165
Me too, I got things
you don't know.

01:17:15.167 --> 01:17:16.861
I mean, you, my granddaughter,

01:17:16.863 --> 01:17:18.656
don't know what I
got inside of me.

01:17:20.223 --> 01:17:21.503
Maybe I'm not that sick.

01:17:23.103 --> 01:17:24.958
Maybe I'm not quite
ready to ride.

01:17:27.615 --> 01:17:29.791
We all keep secrets,
we all hide.

01:17:30.655 --> 01:17:32.028
But if we hide all the time

01:17:32.030 --> 01:17:35.197
and we pretend to be somebody
else all of the time,

01:17:35.199 --> 01:17:36.734
how can anybody find us?

01:17:38.783 --> 01:17:39.999
Nobody knows what I got,

01:17:41.119 --> 01:17:43.039
except a lot of
love for Luana Cole.

01:17:52.894 --> 01:17:55.325
Wow, a movie.

01:17:55.327 --> 01:17:56.701
I feel so stupid.

01:17:56.703 --> 01:17:57.852
Oh.

01:17:57.854 --> 01:17:59.293
Honey, will you forgive me?

01:17:59.295 --> 01:18:02.492
I completely doubted you,
I hate that, I'm sorry.

01:18:02.494 --> 01:18:03.901
That's okay.

01:18:03.903 --> 01:18:06.492
I once believed the moon
in the river was real.

01:18:06.494 --> 01:18:09.308
Trust me, you may be
a lotta things, darling,

01:18:09.310 --> 01:18:11.421
and you'll grow up to
be a whole lot more.

01:18:11.423 --> 01:18:15.068
But stupid, isn't one of 'em.

01:18:15.070 --> 01:18:17.758
Maybe the moon was in the river.

01:18:23.199 --> 01:18:26.367
Tash, don't put my stuff
in the car for tomorrow, um,

01:18:27.967 --> 01:18:30.623
I think I'll stay,
for awhile anyway.

01:18:31.839 --> 01:18:32.959
What'd I tell you?

01:18:34.143 --> 01:18:35.615
What did I tell you?

01:19:04.415 --> 01:19:05.597
Oh my god, oh my god.

01:19:05.599 --> 01:19:06.845
Everything okay?

01:19:06.847 --> 01:19:08.990
Uh, perfect.

01:19:12.799 --> 01:19:15.039
Grammy, could I
ask you a favor?

01:19:16.383 --> 01:19:17.919
You can ask a favor of me.

01:19:19.871 --> 01:19:21.118
Could you say something,

01:19:22.655 --> 01:19:23.869
could you say something to Mom

01:19:23.871 --> 01:19:25.597
so I could go to a
movie on Saturday?

01:19:25.599 --> 01:19:26.399
By yourself?

01:19:28.319 --> 01:19:29.086
With a friend.

01:19:30.335 --> 01:19:31.103
Boy?

01:19:32.030 --> 01:19:32.798
Boy.

01:19:34.783 --> 01:19:36.732
Mm, maybe.

01:19:36.734 --> 01:19:38.654
Maybe we'll introduce
him to your mom.

01:19:41.438 --> 01:19:42.877
Hi.

01:19:42.879 --> 01:19:46.364
Would you like to come
dance with everyone?

01:19:46.366 --> 01:19:47.453
It's okay.

01:20:09.439 --> 01:20:13.246
You've come a long way for
this flood of pain, all shared.

01:20:14.655 --> 01:20:16.317
I have to get back to the
looney tune that I love.

01:20:18.079 --> 01:20:22.718
And you didn't drown, but you
have told many, many lies.

01:20:23.614 --> 01:20:27.199
I was very sick, love sick.

01:20:28.318 --> 01:20:30.332
Now I'm better.

01:20:30.334 --> 01:20:32.125
All's fair in love and war.

01:20:32.127 --> 01:20:35.551
Well, I'm glad to hear
it, and I'm proud of you.

01:20:37.279 --> 01:20:40.445
But precious man, if you
ever decide to quit me,

01:20:40.447 --> 01:20:43.805
don't throw me up against
a tree or a tractor, okay?

01:20:43.807 --> 01:20:45.341
I won't.

01:20:45.343 --> 01:20:46.303
And I won't.

01:20:59.551 --> 01:21:02.047
If I ever decide to quit you,

01:21:04.063 --> 01:21:05.277
I'll keep it a secret.

01:21:41.407 --> 01:21:42.781
- Bye-bye now.
- Bye, Grammy.

01:21:42.783 --> 01:21:43.677
- Now you got reason
- Love you.

01:21:43.679 --> 01:21:46.044
To come more often, love you.

01:21:46.046 --> 01:21:48.156
- It's great to meet you.
- Thank you, take care.

01:21:48.158 --> 01:21:49.469
Bye sweetie.

01:21:49.471 --> 01:21:50.813
- Bye, take care.
- Bye.

01:21:50.815 --> 01:21:52.028
Come on,
Aubrey.

01:21:52.030 --> 01:21:54.749
All
right, drive safe.

01:22:03.614 --> 01:22:04.414
How old is he?

01:22:05.630 --> 01:22:06.430
13.

01:22:08.383 --> 01:22:09.917
What's his name?

01:22:09.919 --> 01:22:10.844
Edward.

01:22:10.846 --> 01:22:14.527
Edward.

01:22:48.800 --> 01:22:53.800
