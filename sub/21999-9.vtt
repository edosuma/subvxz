WEBVTT

00:01.233 --> 00:04.583
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:04.585 --> 00:07.386
are you ready for the main event?

00:09.173 --> 00:10.472
Listen to me, baby boy.

00:10.474 --> 00:11.840
This is a good thing, what you're doing.

00:11.842 --> 00:14.393
Just remember, you got
to let him hit you,

00:14.395 --> 00:16.094
but you ain't got to let him kill you.

00:16.097 --> 00:17.730
Put on a good show.

00:17.732 --> 00:19.064
Lead with your right.

00:19.066 --> 00:20.599
Lay off your left.

00:20.601 --> 00:22.214
No one will know the difference.

00:23.187 --> 00:25.487
...$50,000 purse!

00:30.347 --> 00:31.610
Remember what I said to you.

00:31.612 --> 00:32.995
We're all winners tonight.

00:32.997 --> 00:34.496
He's the big winner,
but you're a winner, too.

00:34.498 --> 00:35.497
$25K

00:35.499 --> 00:36.782
is a lot of scratch.

00:36.784 --> 00:37.783
And Rodrigo

00:37.785 --> 00:38.918
asked me to ask you again,

00:38.920 --> 00:40.369
lay off that left.

00:40.371 --> 00:42.087
Not too much. Make it look real.

00:42.089 --> 00:44.361
I'll meet you here after with the money.

00:51.243 --> 00:52.798
You sure you want to be here for this?

00:53.343 --> 00:54.600
You sure you want to watch this?

00:54.602 --> 00:56.051
You really want to be here?

00:56.053 --> 00:57.937
- You really want to do this?
- ‭Baby,

00:57.939 --> 00:59.271
it's ten grand
just for stepping in the ring.

00:59.273 --> 01:01.223
And another 15 for just laying back.

01:01.225 --> 01:02.558
That's six months' rent.

01:02.560 --> 01:04.393
And we'll be able to buy
the girls Christmas presents.

01:04.394 --> 01:06.228
What's that worth if you're a vegetable?

01:06.230 --> 01:07.646
That's not gonna happen.

01:07.648 --> 01:09.398
Come here.

01:10.401 --> 01:11.483
I love you.

01:11.485 --> 01:12.401
Love you, too.

01:12.403 --> 01:13.452
Weighing in at

01:13.454 --> 01:15.788
205 pounds, in the red corner,

01:15.790 --> 01:17.706
wearing the red trimmed in gold,

01:17.708 --> 01:20.960
his record 20 and 17,

01:20.962 --> 01:22.578
Brooklyn's own

01:22.580 --> 01:26.582
Bobby "Brass" Lewis!

01:31.922 --> 01:34.423
And now, weighing in

01:34.425 --> 01:36.141
at 215 pounds,

01:36.143 --> 01:39.645
in the blue corner, wearing all black,

01:39.647 --> 01:42.815
his record 51 and five,

01:42.817 --> 01:46.819
the former heavyweight champion
of the world,

01:46.821 --> 01:52.491
Rodrigo "the Ramrod" Rivera!

01:56.113 --> 01:59.198
Ladies and gentlemen, I got
to say, Rodrigo is winning this

01:59.200 --> 02:02.201
on points, but we're awfully
light on any real action here,

02:02.203 --> 02:04.586
and the crowd is starting to get surly.

02:04.588 --> 02:08.539
They came to see blood, and
it's in awfully short supply.

02:08.542 --> 02:10.376
Come on, Ramrod!

02:10.377 --> 02:11.960
I came to watch you fight, not dance!

02:11.962 --> 02:15.347
Hey, Ramclod,
you guys fighting or dating?

02:15.349 --> 02:17.766
Ramrod, come on!

02:17.768 --> 02:20.386
Hit him with something
that matters, huh?!

02:23.607 --> 02:25.974
Execute, execute!

02:25.976 --> 02:27.860
- Yeah!
- ‭That's one,

02:27.862 --> 02:28.862
two,

02:28.864 --> 02:30.145
- three,
- ‭Come on, get up!

02:30.147 --> 02:32.147
- Four, five...
- ‭Here we go!

02:32.149 --> 02:33.365
- Six...
- ‭

02:33.367 --> 02:34.316
seven...

02:34.318 --> 02:36.151
Move, come on, get up!

02:36.153 --> 02:37.369
You good?

02:39.000 --> 02:45.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

02:49.133 --> 02:50.716
...two, three,

02:50.718 --> 02:52.000
four,

02:52.002 --> 02:54.887
five, six,

02:54.889 --> 02:56.588
seven, eight...

02:56.590 --> 02:57.589
All right, you good?

02:57.591 --> 02:58.590
Look at me.

02:58.592 --> 03:00.142
All right, let's fight!

03:00.144 --> 03:02.261
Here... here we go!

03:09.520 --> 03:11.136
Where did that left come from?

03:12.188 --> 03:15.991
That left hook from Bobby Lewis
just staggered Ramrod!

03:25.369 --> 03:27.149
There's another left!

03:27.755 --> 03:30.756
And another. Ramrod is down!

03:36.847 --> 03:38.130
What an upset!

03:38.744 --> 03:41.216
Bobby "Brass" Lewis knocks out Rodrigo

03:41.218 --> 03:46.221
"the Ramrod" Rivera
and wins the $50,000 purse!

03:49.894 --> 03:51.059
Mm.

03:51.061 --> 03:53.228
Okay, champ. It's 2:00 a.m.

03:53.230 --> 03:54.897
Wait... ‭You closed the arena.

03:54.899 --> 03:57.733
- Your chariot awaits.
- All right, all right, all right.

03:59.203 --> 04:01.570
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

04:04.959 --> 04:07.626
That really happened tonight, didn't it?

04:07.628 --> 04:08.744
It did.

04:08.746 --> 04:10.796
Come here, come here.

04:10.798 --> 04:12.414
Come here and kiss a champion.

04:17.115 --> 04:18.553
Hey, not here.

04:18.555 --> 04:20.721
What? Come on. What is your hurry?

04:20.724 --> 04:22.808
The kids are with my mom.
It's 3:00 in the morning.

04:22.810 --> 04:24.343
Nobody's on the street.

04:24.345 --> 04:25.727
Nobody's gonna see.

04:25.729 --> 04:26.845
No hurry.

04:26.847 --> 04:30.265
Just not here.

04:38.826 --> 04:40.442
Where are you going? What are you doing?

04:40.444 --> 04:43.579
My bag with my stuff.
My dad put it in the trunk.

04:43.581 --> 04:46.365
- Well, you need the keys, don't ya?
- ‭Yeah.

04:51.622 --> 04:54.289
- Oh, my God.
- ‭What is it? What's wrong?

04:54.291 --> 04:55.624
Nothing.

04:55.626 --> 04:57.155
Just go in the house.

04:58.429 --> 05:00.712
What'd I just tell you?

05:04.552 --> 05:06.635
Bobby, that's Emmett from down the block.

05:06.637 --> 05:07.769
I know, I know.

05:07.771 --> 05:08.887
There's blood here. There's blood

05:08.889 --> 05:10.138
- on the driveway.
- ‭

05:10.140 --> 05:12.140
It's gonna be okay.
I'll take care of this.

05:12.142 --> 05:13.809
Just go inside.

05:13.811 --> 05:17.145
You'll take care of this? How
are you gonna take care of this?

05:17.982 --> 05:19.481
Oh, God.

05:21.485 --> 05:23.151
- 911, what's your emergency?
- Hello, police?

05:23.153 --> 05:25.737
My husband and I just found
a dead body in our car.

05:25.739 --> 05:27.322
- Are you crazy? What are...
- I...

05:27.324 --> 05:28.991
- what are you doing?
- I'm trying to do

05:28.993 --> 05:31.493
- the right thing. We didn't do this.
- Yeah, but the police

05:31.495 --> 05:33.495
aren't gonna believe that.
His body's in my car.

05:33.497 --> 05:35.360
There's blood on the driveway.

05:37.718 --> 05:39.501
So what do we do?

05:39.503 --> 05:40.502
I don't... I don't know.

05:40.504 --> 05:41.837
Don't answer it.

05:41.839 --> 05:43.493
Maybe it'll stop.

05:45.412 --> 05:47.414
I... I need to get rid of this car.

05:51.932 --> 05:54.850
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

05:54.879 --> 05:56.847
_

05:56.872 --> 05:58.854
- Shame on you.
- Shame on me why?

05:58.856 --> 06:00.809
They're adorable.

06:00.811 --> 06:02.691
These are guilt cakes.

06:02.693 --> 06:04.910
Nobody wants 'em,
but nobody can resist 'em.

06:04.912 --> 06:07.529
They have no real nutritional value.

06:07.531 --> 06:09.531
Their sole purpose is to make
you feel better about leaving

06:09.533 --> 06:12.834
on Tuesday for a holiday that
doesn't start until Thursday.

06:12.836 --> 06:14.536
Ooh.

06:14.538 --> 06:17.005
- They got candy corn in 'em. Sinful.
- ‭

06:17.007 --> 06:18.874
When are you leaving for Georgia?

06:18.876 --> 06:20.542
Tuesday. Tomorrow morning.

06:20.544 --> 06:22.802
- Bull insisted.
- Tell me about it.

06:22.804 --> 06:24.846
I'm not even going anywhere,
and he told me not to bother

06:24.848 --> 06:26.798
- coming in.
- You doing

06:26.800 --> 06:28.767
your usual thing? ‭Oh,
this time tomorrow,

06:28.769 --> 06:30.719
I will be on a beach in Florida.

06:30.721 --> 06:32.054
Just me and a margarita.

06:32.056 --> 06:33.855
- What about turkey?
- ‭Mm.

06:33.857 --> 06:35.474
Turkey tastes horrible in a margarita.

06:35.476 --> 06:37.442
‭Kyle, if he weren't

06:37.444 --> 06:40.562
going to China, if I had
someone to do it with,

06:40.564 --> 06:42.864
I'd probably go
the traditional route, but...

06:42.866 --> 06:44.816
Oh, I'd give anything to get out
of doing the traditional thing.

06:44.818 --> 06:46.568
But my family would never forgive me.

06:46.570 --> 06:48.453
Well, I'm not doing it.
I'm not going home this year.

06:48.455 --> 06:51.206
I just refuse to set myself up
for all that heartache.

06:51.208 --> 06:52.874
You're gonna break your parents' hearts.

06:52.876 --> 06:54.209
Yeah.

06:55.045 --> 06:57.296
Oh! Very original.

06:57.298 --> 06:58.900
Ooh. Where's your Thanksgiving at

06:58.902 --> 07:00.415
- this year?
- ‭My, uh,

07:00.417 --> 07:02.384
relatives in Dallas are hosting.

07:02.386 --> 07:04.920
We're flying the Puerto Rican
side of my family in.

07:04.922 --> 07:06.755
- You seem excited.
- ‭Ooh.

07:06.757 --> 07:09.308
It's the best Thanksgiving
dinner in the world.

07:09.310 --> 07:11.510
You have not lived until you've had

07:11.512 --> 07:14.313
my grandmother's pasteles. Mmm!

07:14.315 --> 07:15.931
You only say that 'cause
you haven't been to Thanksgiving

07:15.933 --> 07:17.059
- in Georgia.
- Ah.

07:17.084 --> 07:18.266
A stick of butter on every dish.

07:18.268 --> 07:19.234
Two on the vegetable plate.

07:19.236 --> 07:21.737
- Uh, you cook?
- ‭Every year.

07:21.739 --> 07:23.105
I go to my high school
best friend's house,

07:23.107 --> 07:25.657
fry up a turkey,
get to work on my world famous

07:25.659 --> 07:28.026
- sweet potato pie.
- Ooh, pie.

07:28.028 --> 07:29.945
I need to bring a pie to
my mom's. Can I get that recipe?

07:30.408 --> 07:33.165
It ain't the recipe
that makes it special, baby.

07:33.167 --> 07:36.118
Spare me, Chunk. I will buy a pie.

07:36.120 --> 07:37.836
Hey, does anyone know
what the big guy's doing

07:37.838 --> 07:39.287
for Turkey Day?

07:39.289 --> 07:41.123
I do. But if I tell you,

07:41.125 --> 07:43.542
we'll both need to look for a job.

07:43.544 --> 07:45.127
And that includes everything?
Turkey, stuffing,

07:45.129 --> 07:47.629
mashed potatoes,
pumpkin pie... everything?

07:48.285 --> 07:50.599
Great. Just deliver it
to the address I gave you.

07:50.601 --> 07:52.998
10:00 a.m. Thanksgiving morning.

07:53.687 --> 07:55.303
I know it's an office building.

07:55.305 --> 07:56.355
I'll be here.

07:56.357 --> 07:59.641
The coast is clear.

07:59.643 --> 08:00.976
Everyone's gone?

08:00.978 --> 08:03.695
You won't hear
from a single soul for six days.

08:04.092 --> 08:05.897
I'm so thankful.

08:05.899 --> 08:07.065
Do you want to go ahead
and get this over with,

08:07.067 --> 08:08.316
and then I'll get out of your hair, too?

08:08.680 --> 08:10.473
I'm so excited.

08:17.077 --> 08:19.161
Oh, my gosh.

08:19.163 --> 08:20.829
It's glorious.

08:21.665 --> 08:23.165
I'm just gonna slip out quietly.

08:23.167 --> 08:25.500
Have a wonderful holiday.

08:33.894 --> 08:35.674
Dr. Bull?

08:35.677 --> 08:37.417
Dr. Jason Bull?

08:38.251 --> 08:40.015
I'm sorry, were you talking to me?

08:40.017 --> 08:41.850
Galvin Berry, attorney-at-law.

08:42.172 --> 08:43.684
Can I buy you a drink?

08:43.687 --> 08:45.487
I don't mean to be rude,
but I just started

08:45.489 --> 08:48.640
my Thanksgiving holiday,
and I don't believe we've met.

08:48.642 --> 08:51.993
We haven't, but I'm guessing
you've heard of my client.

08:51.995 --> 08:53.695
Bobby Lewis, the boxer.

08:53.697 --> 08:56.198
Won the biggest fight
of his life last week

08:56.200 --> 08:58.917
and then was accused of beating
one of his neighbors to death.

08:58.919 --> 09:02.037
You got quite the uphill
battle there, Counselor.

09:02.039 --> 09:05.040
A client with a history of priors

09:05.042 --> 09:07.209
known to be pretty good with his fists.

09:07.211 --> 09:09.211
The neighbor was a drug dealer.

09:09.213 --> 09:11.430
They've been known to have altercations.

09:11.785 --> 09:13.131
Good luck with that one.

09:13.133 --> 09:15.550
I don't need luck. I need help.

09:15.956 --> 09:19.438
Judge is insisting on starting
jury selection tomorrow at 1:00.

09:19.834 --> 09:22.224
I think a lot of people over at city hall

09:22.226 --> 09:24.192
just want to get this thing
over with during the holidays

09:24.194 --> 09:25.477
while nobody's paying much attention.

09:26.216 --> 09:28.814
My whole staff just left for the holiday.

09:29.177 --> 09:31.399
What I do is very much a team sport.

09:31.401 --> 09:33.034
Are you leaving town?

09:33.036 --> 09:34.402
I plead the fifth.

09:36.373 --> 09:38.707
It's almost the end of the year.

09:39.104 --> 09:40.542
Have you done anything you regret?

09:41.606 --> 09:45.413
I've known this boy his whole life.

09:45.777 --> 09:47.549
Just go to Rikers, meet him.

09:47.551 --> 09:49.084
I'll set it up.

09:49.489 --> 09:50.752
If you don't think he's innocent,

09:50.754 --> 09:52.587
just don't show up to court tomorrow.

09:53.284 --> 09:54.422
But if you do,

09:54.744 --> 09:57.831
well, remember those regrets?

09:58.846 --> 10:01.012
I'm giving you a chance
to do something about 'em.

10:01.014 --> 10:02.848
Hmm.

Kyle. Oh, my God!

10:33.082 --> 10:34.665
What happened?

10:34.667 --> 10:36.533
Nothing. I'm okay. I'm fine.

10:36.535 --> 10:38.285
It's just...

10:38.287 --> 10:39.953
they took my keys.

10:39.955 --> 10:41.205
I didn't know where else to go.

10:41.207 --> 10:43.290
What are you talking about?
Who took your keys?

10:43.292 --> 10:45.175
I was getting ready to go to the airport.

10:45.177 --> 10:46.627
I had some letters I had to mail.

10:46.629 --> 10:48.629
I just walked to the corner
and got mugged.

10:48.631 --> 10:50.798
They took my keys,
my wallet, my passport.

10:50.800 --> 10:53.357
At 1:00 in the morning
you had to mail letters?

10:53.358 --> 10:54.441
I don't even care about the money.

10:54.443 --> 10:55.608
The credit cards I can replace.

10:55.610 --> 10:57.527
But without my passport, I can't travel.

10:57.529 --> 10:59.529
It'll take at least a week
to get another one.

10:59.531 --> 11:00.914
With the holidays, maybe more.

11:00.916 --> 11:02.665
I'm gonna miss my meetings in China.

11:02.667 --> 11:05.001
Which means that this deal
I've been working on is dead.

11:05.003 --> 11:07.704
- Everything that I've spent years...
- Kyle, shh, shh.

11:07.706 --> 11:10.123
Shh. Hold on. Slow down.

11:10.125 --> 11:12.008
Maybe I can fix this.

11:12.010 --> 11:13.042
What? How?

11:13.044 --> 11:14.177
First of all,

11:14.179 --> 11:15.962
I have a key to your apartment.

11:15.964 --> 11:18.181
Go home. Reschedule your flight.

11:18.183 --> 11:19.382
Call the credit card companies.

11:19.384 --> 11:20.550
No, you're not hearing me.

11:20.552 --> 11:22.302
I need a passport to get to China.

11:22.304 --> 11:23.386
No, I heard you.

11:23.388 --> 11:25.722
I used to work for Homeland Security.

11:25.724 --> 11:27.474
Let me make a few calls.

11:27.476 --> 11:30.226
What happens if you get there
a day later than you planned?

11:30.228 --> 11:32.061
I-I don't even know
if there'll be a seat.

11:32.063 --> 11:33.396
It's the Thanksgiving holiday.

11:33.398 --> 11:35.648
Nobody is going to China. Just you.

11:35.650 --> 11:37.817
I will call our embassy
in China right now.

11:37.819 --> 11:40.069
It's the middle of the day there.

11:40.071 --> 11:42.455
By tomorrow you'll have your passport.

11:42.457 --> 11:44.374
I don't leave
until late tomorrow afternoon.

11:44.376 --> 11:46.376
Text me when you have it.

11:48.274 --> 11:49.796
Looks like you'll live.

11:52.384 --> 11:53.583
Get out of here.

11:53.585 --> 11:56.491
You have a lot of phone calls
to make, and so do I.

12:11.256 --> 12:13.102
So, you're Mr. Berry's friend?

12:13.424 --> 12:15.905
The doctor? The one he says can help me?

12:15.907 --> 12:17.407
Mr. Berry and I aren't really friends.

12:17.409 --> 12:18.658
We just met last night.

12:18.660 --> 12:20.306
Semantics.

12:22.225 --> 12:23.446
Are you surprised

12:23.448 --> 12:25.359
I know a word like "semantics"?

12:25.361 --> 12:27.167
Bobby, I'm meeting you
for the first time.

12:27.169 --> 12:29.419
Everything's gonna be a surprise.

12:30.956 --> 12:33.006
Why don't you tell me how you got here?

12:33.916 --> 12:35.925
I mean, does it make a difference?

12:35.927 --> 12:39.295
I'm a boxer with priors
and former gang ties.

12:39.297 --> 12:41.548
Nobody thinks I'm innocent.

12:41.995 --> 12:44.184
Pretty sure you don't think I'm innocent.

12:44.831 --> 12:46.219
Well, are you?

12:46.221 --> 12:47.971
Look...

12:48.376 --> 12:50.723
I was in a gang.

12:51.087 --> 12:52.308
I don't deny that.

12:52.672 --> 12:54.611
Everybody was where I lived.

12:56.759 --> 12:58.565
You had to be.

12:58.567 --> 13:01.568
Then, um, I found boxing

13:02.348 --> 13:03.850
when I was 14.

13:04.809 --> 13:06.489
And I was good at it.

13:06.895 --> 13:08.324
By the time I was 17,

13:08.646 --> 13:10.106
I was very good at it.

13:11.630 --> 13:14.235
I, uh... I left the gang.

13:15.111 --> 13:16.487
Got focused.

13:17.780 --> 13:19.824
Met a really good woman

13:20.672 --> 13:23.536
and, uh, got married.

13:24.329 --> 13:26.509
Had two beautiful daughters.

13:29.180 --> 13:32.682
All I ever wanted was to give
my wife and babies a home.

13:32.684 --> 13:34.100
Nice things.

13:34.102 --> 13:36.319
And now you're looking at life in prison.

13:36.321 --> 13:38.104
For a crime I did not do.

13:38.885 --> 13:40.553
So tell me what happened.

13:40.942 --> 13:43.056
So...

13:43.848 --> 13:45.194
I win the fight.

13:45.196 --> 13:46.496
And next thing I know...

13:46.498 --> 13:48.197
And then my wife's phone

13:48.199 --> 13:49.699
started ringing again.

13:49.896 --> 13:51.606
And I knew they were on their way.

13:52.649 --> 13:54.787
And sure enough, five minutes later...

13:54.789 --> 13:57.090
Three cop cars.

13:57.092 --> 13:58.905
My wife's screaming.

13:59.781 --> 14:02.211
They read me my rights, and here I am.

14:02.666 --> 14:03.868
Okay.

14:05.411 --> 14:06.382
Tell me again.

14:06.384 --> 14:08.134
Tell me what happened.

14:12.941 --> 14:16.309
So, I win the fight,
and next thing I know...

14:16.311 --> 14:18.478
And then my wife's phone
starts ringing again.

14:18.480 --> 14:20.229
And that's when I knew

14:20.231 --> 14:22.136
I was gonna end up here.

14:23.221 --> 14:24.534
One more time.

14:24.536 --> 14:26.819
What? Why?

14:26.821 --> 14:28.488
Because I asked you to

14:28.490 --> 14:30.239
and because it's gonna help me figure out

14:30.241 --> 14:31.729
if I can help you.

14:34.245 --> 14:35.692
So...

14:36.693 --> 14:38.081
I knocked the big fake out...

14:38.083 --> 14:39.882
Well, what do you think?

14:39.884 --> 14:41.417
I think you're right.

14:41.419 --> 14:42.835
I think he didn't do it.

14:42.837 --> 14:44.053
Told you. He's a good kid.

14:44.055 --> 14:45.388
Well, maybe he is, maybe he isn't.

14:45.390 --> 14:49.058
I think... I know what he's telling me

14:49.060 --> 14:51.477
about that night is what happened.

14:51.479 --> 14:53.563
Your instincts are that good, huh?

14:53.565 --> 14:55.148
I had him take me through it three times.

14:55.150 --> 14:57.600
It's a test called false reiteration.

14:57.602 --> 15:00.153
If he were lying,
he would have told the story

15:00.155 --> 15:02.271
the exact same way over and over again.

15:02.273 --> 15:04.762
It's what people do when
they're making something up.

15:05.847 --> 15:07.493
Every time Bobby told me the story,

15:07.495 --> 15:08.911
he added new details.

15:08.913 --> 15:10.977
Not contradictions, just...

15:11.811 --> 15:13.366
more and more little recollections

15:13.368 --> 15:15.251
as he was remembering what happened.

15:16.425 --> 15:18.568
While I don't believe
he killed that guy...

15:19.819 --> 15:21.541
he's not telling us something.

15:23.156 --> 15:24.127
I got to be in court

15:24.129 --> 15:26.295
for jury selection in two hours.

15:28.244 --> 15:31.039
You dropping me off,
or you coming with me?

15:39.944 --> 15:41.090
Hi, Mom.

15:41.446 --> 15:42.729
No.

15:42.731 --> 15:44.969
I haven't changed my mind.

15:46.304 --> 15:48.284
Look, it's not that I don't want

15:48.286 --> 15:50.069
to spend Thanksgiving with you and Dad.

15:50.071 --> 15:51.320
It's just that...

15:51.322 --> 15:54.228
I want to spend it
with my friends a little more.

15:56.689 --> 15:58.161
What are we having?

15:58.775 --> 16:00.663
Chicken nuggets and Jell-O shots.

16:01.235 --> 16:03.916
Just like they had on the Mayflower.

16:13.456 --> 16:16.646
Ladies and
gentlemen, flight 1253 to Dallas

16:16.648 --> 16:19.515
has been temporarily delayed
due to weather.

16:19.517 --> 16:21.517
As soon as we have
the new departure time,

16:21.519 --> 16:23.352
we will share it with you.

16:23.354 --> 16:24.854
Thanks in advance for your patience,

16:24.856 --> 16:26.072
and in the meantime,

16:26.074 --> 16:28.825
please don't wander
too far from the gate.

16:49.826 --> 16:51.798
It's supposed to be in the 80s in Dallas.

16:52.453 --> 16:54.038
If we get there.

16:55.081 --> 16:56.803
Hmm.

16:59.891 --> 17:03.025
Ah. Thunderstorms.

17:03.423 --> 17:05.144
They'll pass. We'll get there.

17:09.818 --> 17:12.034
Is that Dr. Jason Bull?

17:14.555 --> 17:15.821
I didn't realize
you were gonna be involved

17:15.824 --> 17:17.240
in the Bobby Lewis trial.

17:17.242 --> 17:20.910
ADA Rios, this is Galvin
Berry, counsel for Mr. Lewis,

17:20.912 --> 17:22.994
Mr. Lewis's father, Dennis

17:22.997 --> 17:25.414
and Lucy, his wife,
and their two children.

17:25.818 --> 17:27.083
Good afternoon.

17:27.085 --> 17:29.719
If I could just have a word with
Dr. Bull and you, Mr. Berry?

17:30.513 --> 17:32.054
Give this to the court officer.

17:32.056 --> 17:33.923
Tell him it's for Bobby. They'll
have him change into that

17:33.925 --> 17:35.091
before he goes to court.

17:35.093 --> 17:36.289
Sure thing, you got it.

17:39.063 --> 17:41.147
Just wanted to let you gentlemen
know that we're running

17:41.149 --> 17:43.399
a holiday special
in the DA's office today.

17:43.401 --> 17:45.902
Your client pleads guilty
in return for 20 years.

17:45.904 --> 17:47.270
No possibility of parole,

17:47.272 --> 17:49.605
but at least he's out before he turns 50.

17:49.886 --> 17:51.607
Holiday special, huh?

17:51.609 --> 17:53.359
Does it bother you at all
that he's innocent?

17:53.723 --> 17:54.777
Thank you, Ms. Rios.

17:54.779 --> 17:56.362
We'll be sure to convey
your offer to our client.

17:56.364 --> 17:57.747
By the way,

17:57.749 --> 18:00.583
we're having a little
holiday special of our own.

18:00.938 --> 18:02.702
You withdraw the charges
by the end of the day,

18:02.704 --> 18:05.755
and we won't sue the city
for false arrest.

18:06.235 --> 18:07.874
Happy holidays, gentlemen.

18:09.280 --> 18:11.260
I need you to understand.

18:11.262 --> 18:12.762
This is not how I normally do things.

18:12.764 --> 18:14.797
Usually I have jury lists,
and I've done a lot of research

18:14.799 --> 18:16.799
and I have my staff talking in my ear,

18:16.801 --> 18:18.351
and I have none of those things today.

18:18.831 --> 18:20.686
It's just me and my instincts.

18:21.250 --> 18:23.472
Ask me how many murder cases I've tried.

18:23.474 --> 18:25.691
Whatever you're thinking,
it's less than that.

18:25.693 --> 18:27.643
I'm an attorney from the neighborhood,

18:27.645 --> 18:30.613
and I'm happy to have your help
any way I can get it.

18:36.974 --> 18:38.120
How many of you

18:38.559 --> 18:41.123
were in musical groups
when you were younger?

18:41.125 --> 18:42.992
Rock bands, R&B...

18:42.994 --> 18:45.161
You and your friends,
playing instruments.

18:45.163 --> 18:48.998
Maybe you played at a school
dance or a battle of the bands.

18:49.654 --> 18:51.000
So you're what?

18:51.002 --> 18:52.251
You're, like, a rocker?

18:52.622 --> 18:54.503
I own a plumbing business.

18:54.505 --> 18:57.006
Yes. But you just indicated
that you were in a band

18:57.008 --> 18:58.307
when you were younger.

18:58.309 --> 18:59.759
Anybody ever ask for your autograph?

19:00.506 --> 19:01.677
Do any drugs? Hang out with a groupie?

19:01.679 --> 19:02.929
None of the above.

19:02.931 --> 19:05.398
Plus, it was a long time ago, right?

19:05.400 --> 19:06.349
Yes, sir.

19:06.533 --> 19:08.184
So if someone came to you,

19:08.186 --> 19:09.769
applying for a job, maybe,

19:09.771 --> 19:11.821
and they told you they were in a gang

19:11.823 --> 19:14.774
when they were 13, 14 or 15 years old,

19:14.776 --> 19:16.359
would that inhibit you from hiring them?

19:16.361 --> 19:19.579
You can't honestly equate being
in a band with being in a gang.

19:19.581 --> 19:21.330
- Yes or no, please.
- ‭No.

19:21.332 --> 19:22.698
I wouldn't hire them.

19:22.700 --> 19:24.367
Not in a million years.

19:25.370 --> 19:26.669
Judge, the defense requests

19:26.671 --> 19:28.871
that this juror be removed for cause.

19:28.873 --> 19:32.091
Mr. Berry, it's two days
before Thanksgiving.

19:32.093 --> 19:35.795
This is the fourth juror you've
tried to have removed for cause.

19:35.797 --> 19:38.631
I cannot eliminate everyone
in the jury pool

19:38.633 --> 19:42.134
who might have a bias
against former gang members

19:42.136 --> 19:44.387
or professional boxers.

19:44.389 --> 19:45.721
You're just going to have to make do

19:45.723 --> 19:47.440
with the jury pool we have.

19:47.442 --> 19:49.058
Uh, can he do that?

19:49.060 --> 19:52.028
He's the judge.
He can do almost anything.

19:52.341 --> 19:53.896
Do you live in an apartment?

19:53.898 --> 19:55.982
I share an apartment
with two other women.

19:55.984 --> 19:57.950
Any drug activity that you're
aware of in your building?

19:57.952 --> 19:59.568
You asking me that 'cause I'm black?

19:59.570 --> 20:02.038
Yes. Because she wants to
eliminate you from the jury.

20:02.040 --> 20:03.489
No.

20:03.491 --> 20:06.242
I'm asking you that because
this case is about a man accused

20:06.244 --> 20:08.494
of killing a drug dealer
in his neighborhood,

20:08.496 --> 20:10.713
and your attitudes in regard
to that sort of situation

20:10.715 --> 20:11.998
are relevant.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.501
Yes. I have heard rumors
of drug deals in my building.

20:15.503 --> 20:17.086
So if you woke up tomorrow
and you found out

20:17.088 --> 20:18.971
that someone had done away
with the dealer...?

20:18.973 --> 20:21.090
Would I be upset? Of course not.

20:21.746 --> 20:24.477
The prosecution would ask
that this juror be excused.

20:28.016 --> 20:29.565
Are you a fight fan?

20:29.567 --> 20:30.683
No, I'm not.

20:30.685 --> 20:32.018
You ever heard of the defendant

20:32.020 --> 20:33.986
prior to his arrest
on these murder charges?

20:33.988 --> 20:35.771
No, I had not.

20:35.773 --> 20:38.190
And how do you feel about people
who have gang tattoos?

20:38.192 --> 20:40.276
Well, they're not people I seek out.

20:40.278 --> 20:42.921
They're not people I want
my family to be around.

20:42.923 --> 20:45.531
All right. This guy's
completely toxic for us.

20:45.533 --> 20:48.084
Second you get the chance,
let's cut him loose.

20:48.086 --> 20:50.369
This juror is acceptable
to the prosecution, Your Honor.

20:52.109 --> 20:54.090
Acceptable to the defense as well.

20:55.206 --> 20:56.459
What are you doing?

20:56.461 --> 20:58.627
Sorry, Dr. Bull. I couldn't let
the last black man

20:58.629 --> 20:59.845
in the jury pool get away.

21:00.451 --> 21:03.015
Yes, but he's the wrong black man.

21:03.017 --> 21:04.550
Were you listening to him?

21:04.552 --> 21:06.018
Ladies and gentlemen, we have our jury.

21:06.020 --> 21:07.019
See you all here

21:07.021 --> 21:10.272
tomorrow morning, 9:00 a.m. sharp.

21:11.420 --> 21:12.808
I'm sorry.

21:13.214 --> 21:15.091
But I have instincts, too.

21:15.697 --> 21:18.481
Right. I just, uh...

21:18.483 --> 21:20.816
I want to believe
we seated at least one person

21:20.818 --> 21:23.402
who would absolutely not vote guilty.

21:23.743 --> 21:26.155
Frankly, I can't be sure we did.

21:37.655 --> 21:38.821
And where's your mother?

21:38.823 --> 21:40.289
She's the one that usually picks me up.

21:40.291 --> 21:43.575
Well, I can drive now,
so I offered to pick you up.

21:43.577 --> 21:45.577
Well, all right. Works for me.

21:46.714 --> 21:48.997
And I wanted to talk to you
about something.

21:48.999 --> 21:50.749
You Baker women.

21:50.751 --> 21:53.462
‭Always with an agenda.

21:54.421 --> 21:59.141
So, we found out last night
that I got into NYU.

21:59.143 --> 22:00.592
Early decision.

22:00.594 --> 22:01.727
And they gave me a scholarship.

22:01.729 --> 22:03.645
- Oh!
- ‭

22:03.647 --> 22:04.847
That's amazing!

22:04.849 --> 22:06.064
Oh, that's fantastic.

22:06.066 --> 22:07.683
I'm so proud of you.

22:07.685 --> 22:09.986
Thing is, Mom doesn't want me to go.

22:10.466 --> 22:11.419
What?

22:11.421 --> 22:14.356
She says it's too far and too dangerous.

22:14.358 --> 22:16.825
Well, that's just crazy.

22:16.827 --> 22:19.862
It's no more dangerous
than any other big city, and...

22:19.864 --> 22:22.114
well, as far as it being far...
you get on a plane.

22:22.116 --> 22:23.532
It's not like you have to walk there.

22:23.534 --> 22:25.042
Will you talk to her for me?

22:25.736 --> 22:28.120
If anyone can convince her, it's you.

23:00.571 --> 23:02.788
Are we in Dallas yet?

23:04.658 --> 23:06.575
Did we miss Thanksgiving?

23:06.577 --> 23:07.703
No.

23:08.128 --> 23:09.828
Still Tuesday.

23:10.164 --> 23:11.957
Tuesday night. Well, uh...

23:11.982 --> 23:13.665
almost Tuesday night.

23:15.418 --> 23:17.336
Oh, I must have fallen asleep.

23:21.175 --> 23:23.052
Can I buy you a drink?

23:25.062 --> 23:26.345
I wouldn't think so, no.

23:26.347 --> 23:29.516
Oh, sorry. Are you... married?

23:29.518 --> 23:30.515
Am I being...

23:30.517 --> 23:32.851
No, no, no, you're not
being anything. It's just...

23:32.853 --> 23:34.569
This is New York.

23:34.571 --> 23:37.155
Uh... you realize the drinking age is 21?

23:38.442 --> 23:40.359
So what's the problem...
you're not old enough?

23:41.912 --> 23:43.195
You're over 21?

23:43.197 --> 23:44.579
Quite a bit.

23:44.581 --> 23:46.200
How about you?

23:48.577 --> 23:50.168
Do you want to proof me?

23:56.794 --> 23:58.927
I'll show you mine if you show me yours.

23:58.929 --> 24:01.129
All right.

24:08.980 --> 24:12.606
_

24:14.278 --> 24:16.278
Hello. Uh, this is Marissa Morgan.

24:16.280 --> 24:18.530
I need a car to take me
to Kennedy Airport.

24:18.532 --> 24:19.898
Yeah, uh, that's the address.

24:19.900 --> 24:22.034
And you have my credit card on file.

24:22.036 --> 24:24.236
Of course I can hold.

24:26.957 --> 24:28.874
Hi, hello, yes, I am.

24:28.876 --> 24:31.326
Well, no, wait. No.

24:31.328 --> 24:33.712
Uh, that's not possible.
I'm not over my limit.

24:33.714 --> 24:35.914
I'm nowhere near my limit.

24:35.916 --> 24:38.750
Um, let me give you another credit card.

24:38.752 --> 24:41.136
Okay. Uh, it is a Pan-American card...

24:41.755 --> 24:43.716
Oh, you have it. Fantastic.

24:44.925 --> 24:47.509
What do you mean,
that one was rejected, too?

24:49.930 --> 24:52.564
No, I don't have any other credit cards.

24:53.984 --> 24:56.768
No, there's nothing else
you can do for me right now.

24:59.606 --> 25:02.691
Yes, and Happy Thanksgiving to you.

25:03.152 --> 25:05.444
There is no Thanksgiving like

25:05.446 --> 25:06.945
a Puerto Rican Thanksgiving.

25:06.947 --> 25:08.697
- Wait, no pumpkin pie?
- You don't need it.

25:08.699 --> 25:12.284
We have Grandma's tembleque.

25:12.286 --> 25:13.535
Okay, what's that?

25:13.537 --> 25:15.921
It is a coconut pudding.

25:16.373 --> 25:17.873
It is the reason

25:17.875 --> 25:20.292
why God gave you lips.

25:21.211 --> 25:22.544
And a tongue.

25:22.922 --> 25:24.296
And taste buds.

25:24.298 --> 25:26.548
It is something to be thankful for.

25:27.134 --> 25:28.967
Well, I'll have to try it sometime.

25:29.345 --> 25:30.998
You sure you're really 34?

25:31.000 --> 25:32.007
Ladies and gentlemen,

25:32.032 --> 25:33.688
we regret to inform you that

25:33.690 --> 25:35.974
due to continuing poor weather
across the southern part

25:35.976 --> 25:37.642
of the country, all flights to Dallas

25:37.644 --> 25:40.645
are on hold until the morning.

25:40.647 --> 25:42.182
The prosecution

25:42.184 --> 25:43.901
would like to call Mary LaFleur.

25:51.825 --> 25:53.208
Ms. LaFleur,

25:53.210 --> 25:55.577
will you state your
relationship to Bobby Lewis?

25:55.579 --> 25:58.130
I'm his neighbor.
I live right across the street.

25:58.132 --> 25:59.798
And how long have you been neighbors?

25:59.800 --> 26:01.249
He's been there a couple years.

26:01.251 --> 26:02.834
I've been there almost 40.

26:03.462 --> 26:05.470
And in that time, have you witnessed

26:05.472 --> 26:07.005
any altercations

26:07.007 --> 26:09.091
between Mr. Lewis and the deceased,

26:09.093 --> 26:10.392
Mr. Emmett Sawyer?

26:10.394 --> 26:11.977
All the time.

26:11.979 --> 26:14.012
Mr. Sawyer liked to stand on the corner,

26:14.014 --> 26:16.181
like a lot of the men who didn't work.

26:16.183 --> 26:19.067
And, you know, sometimes at late
night, they'd get kind of loud.

26:19.069 --> 26:20.435
And this man here

26:20.437 --> 26:23.071
was always calling him a drug dealer.

26:23.073 --> 26:25.607
Telling him to stay the hell
away from his wife and kids.

26:25.609 --> 26:27.609
Telling him to stay
the hell off the block,

26:27.611 --> 26:29.027
off the corner.

26:29.029 --> 26:30.862
I could hear them from my bedroom.

26:30.864 --> 26:32.864
And the night of the murder,

26:32.866 --> 26:34.666
did you hear anything from your bedroom?

26:34.668 --> 26:35.700
I sure did.

26:35.702 --> 26:37.369
I heard it and I saw it.

26:37.371 --> 26:40.539
It was around 1:00
in the morning. And this one

26:40.541 --> 26:43.341
was drunk. I guess
he had just won some fight.

26:43.343 --> 26:44.759
And the two of them just started

26:44.761 --> 26:47.879
getting into it in front of his driveway.

26:47.881 --> 26:49.214
When you say "getting into it"...

26:49.216 --> 26:51.183
Well, first there was yelling.

26:51.185 --> 26:53.351
And then they started pushing.

26:53.353 --> 26:54.936
And then there was punching.

26:54.938 --> 26:57.472
But that didn't last long. This one

26:57.474 --> 27:00.976
punched Mr. Sawyer in the head,
and the next thing you know,

27:00.978 --> 27:02.144
he was on the ground.

27:02.146 --> 27:04.529
And what else did you see, Ms. LaFleur?

27:04.531 --> 27:05.564
Not much.

27:05.566 --> 27:07.282
I stepped away from the window.

27:07.284 --> 27:09.034
I was scared this one

27:09.036 --> 27:12.237
might see me. Next thing
I heard was sirens.

27:12.781 --> 27:14.122
And you know the rest.

27:15.325 --> 27:17.159
No further questions.

27:17.161 --> 27:18.460
Your witness.

27:18.462 --> 27:21.163
Let's take a ten-minute recess.

27:24.835 --> 27:27.252
None of that's true. Lucy was with me.

27:27.254 --> 27:29.421
He was already in the trunk
when we got home.

27:29.423 --> 27:31.389
We know. And when the time comes,

27:31.391 --> 27:33.675
we will call your wife to the stand.

27:33.677 --> 27:36.394
But it'll be our word
against your neighbor's,

27:36.396 --> 27:38.013
and your neighbor will win,

27:38.015 --> 27:40.432
because there doesn't appear
to be anything in it for her.

27:40.434 --> 27:41.816
Unless, of course, there is.

27:41.818 --> 27:44.653
Is there some history between
you two we should know about?

27:44.655 --> 27:45.856
Yeah.

27:46.482 --> 27:48.657
I shoveled her walk
last winter when it snowed.

27:48.659 --> 27:49.991
And that's it?

27:49.993 --> 27:51.443
You have no idea why that lady's

27:51.445 --> 27:54.112
working so hard to shatter your alibi?

27:54.823 --> 27:56.198
I need to hit the head.

27:56.200 --> 27:58.166
Huh.

28:03.457 --> 28:04.873
What are you thinking?

28:04.875 --> 28:06.625
I'm thinking our witness is a liar,

28:06.627 --> 28:08.460
the jury's falling for it hook,
line and sinker,

28:08.462 --> 28:12.047
and our client
isn't telling us something.

28:19.593 --> 28:21.593
_

28:21.653 --> 28:24.536
Kyle, I can't
get any money out of my ATM.

28:24.603 --> 28:27.537
It says my account has been emptied.

28:30.865 --> 28:33.601
And my credit cards
have all been maxed out, too.

28:35.968 --> 28:38.102
I'm guessing you're still in the air.

28:40.940 --> 28:43.107
Please call me when you land.

28:48.614 --> 28:51.415
Benjamin Colón, first class passenger

28:51.417 --> 28:53.534
Benjamin Colón,
please report to your gate

28:53.536 --> 28:54.615
- so we can assign you
- Benny.

28:54.640 --> 28:56.287
To an outbound Dallas flight.

28:56.289 --> 28:57.845
Benjamin Colón.

28:58.762 --> 29:00.958
Benny, wake up. ‭Hmm?

29:00.960 --> 29:03.427
Hi. I'm Benjamin Colón. You paged me?

29:03.429 --> 29:05.346
Uh, yes, Mr. Colón.

29:05.348 --> 29:08.099
We have a seat for you
on a flight to Chicago.

29:08.101 --> 29:09.633
You change planes there

29:09.635 --> 29:12.853
and then you're on to Dallas.

29:12.855 --> 29:15.306
You should make it there by 1:30.

29:15.308 --> 29:17.441
I know it's not what you signed up for,

29:17.443 --> 29:19.283
but it's the best we can do.

29:20.576 --> 29:21.946
And what if I wanted to give my ticket

29:21.948 --> 29:23.981
to this nice young lady right here?

29:24.496 --> 29:26.617
- You can't do that.
- Sure he can.

29:26.619 --> 29:28.402
I just need to see your ID, please.

29:28.404 --> 29:30.638
Come on. What about
your Grandma's tembleque?

29:30.640 --> 29:33.592
Oh... There's always next year.

29:33.594 --> 29:35.709
Miss, I need your ID.

29:39.248 --> 29:40.631
Are you sure about this?

29:40.633 --> 29:41.832
You hardly know me.

29:41.834 --> 29:44.808
Hey, you slept on my shoulder,

29:45.304 --> 29:47.471
I know your real age.

29:47.473 --> 29:50.424
Uh, Miss, I need you to board
the plane right now, please.

29:54.564 --> 29:56.097
Okay, well...

29:56.099 --> 29:57.398
how do I pay you back?

29:57.400 --> 29:59.433
I don't really know anything about you.

29:59.435 --> 30:01.685
Your address... anything.

30:01.687 --> 30:03.104
What's-what's your phone number?

30:03.106 --> 30:04.605
It's 212

30:04.607 --> 30:07.274
555-0178.

30:10.079 --> 30:12.113
That's me. Text me back.

30:12.115 --> 30:14.532
Thanks. You're all set.

30:21.674 --> 30:23.340
Happy Thanksgiving.

30:44.593 --> 30:47.475
_

30:50.903 --> 30:52.286
Happy Thanksgiving.

30:52.288 --> 30:54.155
So...

30:54.157 --> 30:56.157
I heard about Anna,

30:56.505 --> 30:58.409
NYU.

30:58.411 --> 31:01.412
Let me guess. She asked you
to talk to me about it?

31:02.755 --> 31:03.954
It's an amazing school.

31:04.888 --> 31:07.251
And New York is an amazing place.

31:07.253 --> 31:10.004
I'm not sending her
all the way to New York

31:10.006 --> 31:11.922
when she could go to Emory
or Georgia Tech,

31:11.924 --> 31:13.924
two perfectly good schools that are not

31:13.926 --> 31:16.093
- in the murder capital of the world.
- Oh, come on,

31:16.095 --> 31:17.645
New York City is not like that.

31:17.647 --> 31:19.230
That's from when you were a kid.

31:20.266 --> 31:21.599
Now over to Dave,

31:21.601 --> 31:24.185
with the latest in the Bobby Lewis trial.

31:24.187 --> 31:26.604
Things have been heating
up in the Bobby Lewis trial.

31:26.606 --> 31:28.739
That's right, we've been on...

31:41.621 --> 31:44.421
Thanks. Nothing says Thanksgiving

31:44.423 --> 31:47.791
like a can of beer and nothing else.

31:53.599 --> 31:54.632
Hi, Mom.

31:54.634 --> 31:56.634
Happy Thanksgiving.

31:56.636 --> 32:00.304
Uh, I was just wondering
what are you guys were up to.

32:04.810 --> 32:07.111
This has got to be a
health code violation.

32:07.113 --> 32:08.529
Oh, my goodness.

32:10.399 --> 32:12.866
I didn't, in the midst
of a drunken stupor last night,

32:12.868 --> 32:16.403
call you and invite you over
for Thanksgiving, did I?

32:16.405 --> 32:18.656
It's good to see you too, Dr. Bull.

32:19.829 --> 32:20.964
No.

32:22.128 --> 32:24.111
Little apple pie for you.

32:24.112 --> 32:27.364
I got a big one for my family
and a... a little one for you.

32:27.763 --> 32:29.866
I'm on my way to, uh, see my folks.

32:29.868 --> 32:33.203
But I, um... caught you
on the news this morning

32:33.205 --> 32:34.955
on the courthouse steps with the lawyer

32:34.957 --> 32:37.707
who's defending Bobby Lewis.

32:37.709 --> 32:39.209
You're working the case, aren't you?

32:40.512 --> 32:42.545
Well, "working" may be overstating it.

32:42.547 --> 32:44.965
But... yes.

32:44.967 --> 32:46.216
It sort of fell into my lap

32:46.218 --> 32:47.851
after everyone left for Thanksgiving.

32:47.853 --> 32:49.269
Please don't tell anyone.

32:49.271 --> 32:50.804
I don't want anyone rushing back,

32:50.806 --> 32:52.222
ruining their holiday.

32:52.224 --> 32:54.607
Well, uh, how's it coming?
How you feeling?

32:56.111 --> 32:58.728
I am feeling like a blind airline pilot

32:58.730 --> 33:01.564
trying to land a giant 777 on a tiny

33:01.566 --> 33:03.316
speck of land in the
middle of the Pacific

33:03.318 --> 33:05.226
with no radar, no autopilot,

33:05.228 --> 33:07.620
during a giant hurricane...

33:07.622 --> 33:09.572
on a moonless night.

33:11.410 --> 33:13.076
No team here at TAC.

33:13.078 --> 33:14.684
I'm working with a lawyer

33:15.380 --> 33:16.713
who's never tried a homicide,

33:16.715 --> 33:18.915
in front of a judge who
just wants it all to be over,

33:18.917 --> 33:21.084
and working with a client

33:21.733 --> 33:23.735
who's not telling me the whole truth.

33:24.611 --> 33:26.589
- You think he did it?
- Why would anyone

33:27.614 --> 33:30.727
who spent their adulthood
dreaming of becoming a champion

33:31.284 --> 33:34.848
finally win the fight of
their life and ruin it all

33:35.163 --> 33:37.600
by going out and killing someone
they barely know?

33:37.602 --> 33:38.935
It doesn't make any sense.

33:38.937 --> 33:40.836
Makes me want to watch the fight.

33:41.773 --> 33:43.656
Yeah.

33:47.008 --> 33:48.194
What do you mean?

33:49.469 --> 33:50.697
I ever tell you about my dad?

33:51.388 --> 33:52.866
You two would actually really get along.

33:53.169 --> 33:55.452
He was a fighter pilot in the Air Force.

33:55.454 --> 33:58.004
Flew I don't know how many
missions in Nam.

33:58.520 --> 33:59.422
Red hair.

33:59.855 --> 34:01.007
Alabaster skin.

34:01.009 --> 34:03.293
160 pounds, six-one.

34:03.295 --> 34:05.795
Could never bring himself
to step on an ant,

34:05.797 --> 34:07.514
but loves boxing.

34:07.516 --> 34:09.156
Always has.

34:09.684 --> 34:11.217
When I was growing up, he had, uh,

34:11.219 --> 34:14.137
VHS tapes of all the great fights.

34:14.139 --> 34:16.806
Ali versus Foreman, Ali versus Frazier,

34:17.371 --> 34:19.525
Hagler versus Leonard.

34:19.527 --> 34:22.478
And we would watch them all the time.

34:22.481 --> 34:24.647
And he would say to me, "Danielle,

34:25.338 --> 34:27.817
"a great fight is like a story.

34:28.467 --> 34:30.217
"The two fighters come out,

34:30.655 --> 34:32.655
"that's your 'once upon a time.'

34:32.657 --> 34:33.907
"And by the time it's over,

34:33.909 --> 34:36.326
"one of the guys is more famous

34:36.328 --> 34:38.685
"and has a lot more money.

34:39.895 --> 34:41.714
That's your 'happily ever after'."

34:43.001 --> 34:44.149
Look at him.

34:44.920 --> 34:47.170
That's not a guy that wants to win.

34:47.652 --> 34:48.888
But then...

34:52.741 --> 34:54.511
Whatever he's not telling you,

34:54.513 --> 34:57.764
is probably somewhere
in the story of that fight.

35:06.260 --> 35:09.749
Hey. Hi.

35:09.810 --> 35:12.945
Uh, is there any way
that we could clear this room?

35:12.947 --> 35:15.063
You can leave Bobby's
shackles on, but I-I just,

35:15.065 --> 35:17.449
I have to have a private
conference with my client.

35:22.854 --> 35:23.989
If it makes you nervous,

35:23.991 --> 35:25.624
you can wait right outside the door.

35:26.127 --> 35:28.026
We just need some privacy.

35:39.079 --> 35:41.640
You ever try to fight with one
hand tied behind your back?

35:44.011 --> 35:46.511
- What the hell are you doin', man?
- Oh, look at that.

35:46.513 --> 35:48.397
You're a southpaw.

35:48.399 --> 35:50.148
You like to fight with your left.

35:50.150 --> 35:52.150
But of course, who would know that?

35:52.152 --> 35:53.568
You're a nobody, a nothing,

35:53.570 --> 35:55.570
a club fighter nobody
was paying attention to.

35:55.572 --> 35:58.523
At least you were,
until your fight with Ramrod.

35:58.525 --> 35:59.825
What are you doing?

35:59.827 --> 36:01.910
What are you doing?

36:02.763 --> 36:05.630
I ever tell you how badly I hate to lose?

36:05.632 --> 36:07.699
Come on. You know what I'm talking about,

36:07.701 --> 36:09.451
'cause you suffer from the same disease.

36:09.453 --> 36:10.786
You hate to lose, too.

36:10.788 --> 36:12.004
I know.

36:12.006 --> 36:14.339
I studied that fight.

36:14.781 --> 36:17.876
I saw the moment when
you decided, "screw this,"

36:18.493 --> 36:20.453
and you let him have it with your left.

36:21.215 --> 36:23.131
It's a great feeling, isn't it?

36:23.915 --> 36:25.183
To triumph?

36:25.185 --> 36:26.518
To win?

36:26.520 --> 36:27.936
Even when you've been set up to lose,

36:27.938 --> 36:29.054
'cause that's what's happened to me.

36:29.056 --> 36:30.772
I've got one hand tied behind my back.

36:30.774 --> 36:33.058
And you set me up to lose,
and the irony is,

36:33.060 --> 36:35.227
I'm trying to save your life.

36:36.761 --> 36:37.729
I don't know what you're talking about.

36:37.731 --> 36:39.731
You were supposed to throw the fight.

36:39.733 --> 36:42.067
That's the real reason
we're here. You didn't do

36:42.069 --> 36:44.569
what you promised, so someone,

36:44.571 --> 36:46.238
I'm guessing the mob,

36:46.240 --> 36:48.957
planted that body to teach you...
and anybody else

36:48.959 --> 36:51.993
who was thinking of
double-crossing them... a lesson.

36:54.613 --> 36:56.631
I don't hear you denying anything.

36:56.948 --> 36:58.417
Look, man, what difference does it make?

36:58.419 --> 37:00.085
There's nothing you can do.

37:00.087 --> 37:02.304
There's nothing anybody can do.

37:03.079 --> 37:05.223
The fix is in. I'm going to prison.

37:05.790 --> 37:07.059
My wife might as well be a widow.

37:07.061 --> 37:09.344
My kids have one parent.

37:09.711 --> 37:11.179
My dad's gonna be crying himself to sleep

37:11.181 --> 37:13.231
for the rest of his life.

37:15.425 --> 37:17.319
It is what it is.

37:18.345 --> 37:19.738
But it doesn't have to be.

37:19.740 --> 37:22.274
I mean, yeah, sure, in court, we're dead.

37:22.276 --> 37:23.992
We got maybe a one in twelve shot

37:23.994 --> 37:25.610
of this jury not convicting you.

37:25.612 --> 37:27.362
And that's from a guy
whose business it is

37:27.364 --> 37:28.580
to know what the odds are

37:28.582 --> 37:30.615
when it comes to juries.

37:30.617 --> 37:32.067
So...

37:35.570 --> 37:39.458
...let me try and settle this
out of court.

37:39.866 --> 37:41.009
Give me a name.

37:41.451 --> 37:43.044
Point me to someone.

37:43.870 --> 37:45.955
Let me try and save your life.

37:47.968 --> 37:49.134
Coming, coming.

37:49.845 --> 37:51.103
What are you doing here?

37:51.105 --> 37:53.355
I thought you were already
in the car with Anna.

37:53.357 --> 37:54.806
She's in the car.

37:54.808 --> 37:56.975
I wanted another shot at you, alone.

37:57.967 --> 37:59.895
We already had this conversation.

37:59.897 --> 38:01.480
I'm not sending my baby girl

38:01.482 --> 38:03.281
all the way to New York alone.

38:03.283 --> 38:04.566
I'm not gonna do it.

38:04.568 --> 38:07.235
She won't be alone. I'll be there.

38:07.602 --> 38:08.954
That's where I live.

38:08.956 --> 38:10.923
Yes, but it's not the same thing.

38:10.925 --> 38:13.792
She's not gonna come to you
like she comes to me.

38:13.794 --> 38:15.819
Well, maybe she would
if she knew the truth.

38:18.446 --> 38:20.081
You want to tell her with me?

38:21.616 --> 38:23.301
She's 18.

38:23.827 --> 38:27.330
She's old enough to know
who her father is.

38:30.177 --> 38:31.977
Come on.

38:31.979 --> 38:33.845
Let's go tell her.

38:33.847 --> 38:35.981
Together.

38:44.658 --> 38:46.324
Oh, thank God.

38:46.326 --> 38:48.610
Thought you were never
coming out of there.

38:49.978 --> 38:51.079
We know each other?

38:51.081 --> 38:54.199
I'm Dr. Jason Bull, part
of Bobby Lewis's defense team.

38:56.067 --> 38:57.169
Aren't you missing your trial?

38:58.422 --> 38:59.955
I think we both know

38:59.957 --> 39:01.706
it doesn't much matter
what goes on in there.

39:01.708 --> 39:03.675
The end of that story's
already been written.

39:03.677 --> 39:05.594
Just a question of whether we allow it

39:05.596 --> 39:07.295
to reach its conclusion or not.

39:07.297 --> 39:10.882
I don't know who you think I am,
or what you think I know.

39:11.833 --> 39:13.718
Clearly, you've mistaken me
for someone else.

39:14.377 --> 39:15.804
Come on. Freddy.

39:16.504 --> 39:17.889
I think there's a world

39:18.339 --> 39:20.025
where we can all be winners here.

39:20.925 --> 39:23.361
My guy will be a big winner,

39:23.678 --> 39:26.064
you and your guys
will be big winners, too.

39:27.568 --> 39:29.203
_

39:29.205 --> 39:31.099
Is the defense ready

39:31.101 --> 39:32.352
to commence closing arguments?

39:32.354 --> 39:33.886
We are, Your Honor.

39:34.386 --> 39:35.936
Begging your pardon, Your Honor.

39:35.938 --> 39:37.354
New forensic evidence

39:37.356 --> 39:40.057
has just come to our attention
in this case,

39:40.059 --> 39:42.330
and recognizing our role
as truth seekers,

39:42.331 --> 39:45.582
we are at this time filing
a motion to dismiss the charges

39:45.584 --> 39:47.167
against Bobby Lewis

39:47.169 --> 39:48.468
in the death of Emmet Sawyer.

39:51.256 --> 39:52.505
Order.

39:52.507 --> 39:54.224
We'll have order in the court, please.

39:55.942 --> 39:58.762
Counselor, are you certain about this?

39:58.764 --> 40:00.131
Yes, Your Honor.

40:00.399 --> 40:03.066
I'm not at liberty to discuss
our new findings in open court,

40:03.068 --> 40:04.684
but suffice it to say,

40:04.686 --> 40:08.021
we have definitive evidence
pointing to the real killer.

40:08.306 --> 40:10.073
Our apologies to the court,

40:10.075 --> 40:12.442
to Mr. Lewis and to his family.

40:12.444 --> 40:14.828
This is the most confounding
end of a trial

40:14.830 --> 40:16.564
I have ever witnessed.

40:18.858 --> 40:20.166
But case dismissed.

40:21.336 --> 40:24.072
Mr. Lewis, you are free to go.

40:44.943 --> 40:46.559
Hey, hey, hey.

40:46.561 --> 40:47.811
Can you give us a few minutes?

40:47.813 --> 40:49.906
- Sure. See you soon.
- Thanks, Dad.

40:58.490 --> 40:59.489
What did you do?

41:00.275 --> 41:02.459
Made a deal with the devil.

41:02.461 --> 41:04.327
Actually, just renegotiated a deal

41:04.329 --> 41:06.579
you'd already made and reneged on.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.299
They own you now, Bobby.

41:09.301 --> 41:12.636
But of course, they owned you before.

41:12.638 --> 41:14.587
They were just so mad
that they couldn't see

41:14.589 --> 41:18.174
you were worth more to them
as a champion they could bet on

41:18.176 --> 41:20.343
than a loser behind bars.

41:21.129 --> 41:22.812
But at least

41:22.814 --> 41:24.147
you're back home now.

41:24.149 --> 41:25.482
With your wife.

41:25.484 --> 41:26.683
You'll see your girls grow up.

41:26.685 --> 41:28.518
Spend time with your dad.

41:28.520 --> 41:30.054
And make a pretty nice living.

41:30.689 --> 41:31.931
Thank you.

41:32.524 --> 41:33.975
Man, I am just so...

41:34.860 --> 41:35.909
thankful.

41:37.029 --> 41:38.354
Here's the thing.

41:39.197 --> 41:40.780
The day will come.

41:40.782 --> 41:42.198
The day they...

41:42.200 --> 41:44.534
no longer have confidence
that you're a sure winner,

41:44.536 --> 41:47.287
and they'll ask you
to throw one, and if you don't,

41:47.289 --> 41:48.621
they're not gonna waste time

41:48.623 --> 41:51.207
putting somebody else's body
in the trunk of your car.

41:51.209 --> 41:52.292
It'll be yours.

41:52.294 --> 41:53.376
You understand?

41:53.378 --> 41:54.794
How do I make this up to you?

41:54.796 --> 41:55.845
It's easy.

41:55.847 --> 41:57.764
When I send you my bill, pay it.

41:57.766 --> 42:00.383
And when you talk to your wife,
your lawyer, your priest,

42:00.385 --> 42:01.768
play dumb.

42:01.770 --> 42:03.386
No one can ever know.

42:03.388 --> 42:05.438
Have a nice life, Bobby Lewis.

42:09.895 --> 42:12.395
Hey, you're back. How was Florida?

42:12.397 --> 42:14.197
Unbelievable.

42:14.199 --> 42:15.732
I'm like a new person.

42:15.734 --> 42:16.900
Ah.

42:16.902 --> 42:18.451
Kyle made it to China?

42:18.453 --> 42:20.070
So he says.

42:20.072 --> 42:22.288
So much to be thankful for.

42:22.290 --> 42:24.657
So much to be thankful for.

42:25.443 --> 42:26.910
Good to have you back.

42:26.912 --> 42:28.294
Good to be back.

42:29.822 --> 42:32.415
So what are you doing here,
this hour of the night?

42:32.417 --> 42:35.085
Uh, trying to track down
a lost friend on the Internet.

42:35.087 --> 42:37.554
Just easier to do here at TAC.

42:37.556 --> 42:38.922
Huh.

42:38.924 --> 42:40.340
You're good?

42:40.342 --> 42:41.808
Couldn't be better.
