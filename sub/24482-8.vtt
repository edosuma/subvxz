WEBVTT

00:13.555 --> 00:15.598
You sure you can get us back
without a map?

00:15.682 --> 00:17.350
Hey, come on.

00:17.434 --> 00:21.396
Obviously, I memorized and studied
the topography before we left.

00:21.479 --> 00:25.817
If I didn't know better, I would
think you were trying to impress me.

00:25.900 --> 00:27.277
Maybe I am.

00:30.780 --> 00:34.826
Five bucks says the Dhars' Jupiter
is over that rise. Come on.

00:36.578 --> 00:39.414
Since when have you ever
known me to gamble? We've had our share of bets
over the years.

00:42.417 --> 00:45.003
Yeah, but it's not gambling
when I know I'm right.

00:45.086 --> 00:47.464
Which is why I'm down 340 bucks.

00:48.506 --> 00:50.258
Wait, you kept track?

00:50.341 --> 00:53.762
I was just waiting for the day
that I win it all back.

00:54.846 --> 00:56.806
Dhars, just over that hill.

00:58.725 --> 01:01.352
That's a Jupiter engine.
Where's my five bucks?

01:02.645 --> 01:03.897
Wait, are they taking off?

01:05.523 --> 01:06.566
I don't know.

01:19.412 --> 01:22.207
<i>Affirmative for pre-check clearance.</i>

01:25.210 --> 01:28.129
<i>Launch will commence</i>
<i>in T
<i>Victor</i></i>

01:33.051 --> 01:34.010
Maureen.

01:35.762 --> 01:36.971
<i>No idea, have you?</i>

01:37.680 --> 01:40.141
<i>There was an accident. </i>
<i>A colonist was injured.</i>

01:40.225 --> 01:41.518
In an attempt to save his life,

01:41.601 --> 01:43.728
your daughter lost nearly all the fuel
we managed to recover.

01:44.479 --> 01:46.356
What do you mean <i>nearly</i> all the fuel?

01:46.773 --> 01:47.982
Commence pre-launch sequence.

01:49.275 --> 01:50.777
<i>Victor.</i>

01:58.159 --> 02:02.705
Prisha, it's important.
How much fuel do you have, exactly?

02:03.456 --> 02:05.875
Maureen, I promise we'll send back help.

02:06.793 --> 02:08.086
17.3%.

02:09.796 --> 02:13.800
Shut down the engines. You're too heavy.
You won't make it out of the atmosphere.

02:13.883 --> 02:15.176
Keep 'em talking.

02:15.260 --> 02:17.428
Victor, you have to listen to me.

02:28.815 --> 02:29.649
Listen to me.

02:30.150 --> 02:33.361
<i>You will burn up all the fuel </i>
<i>before you reach escape velocity.</i>

02:35.446 --> 02:37.949
-Maybe we should listen to her.
-The computer says it's fine.

02:38.032 --> 02:41.077
<i>The computer will tell you</i>
<i>it's fine but it's wrong.</i>

02:41.161 --> 02:42.871
<i>It's not calibrated for this planet.</i>

02:43.454 --> 02:46.541
You won't survive. None of you will.

02:54.173 --> 02:55.884
<i> You're full of information now.</i>

02:55.967 --> 02:58.469
But I had to find out this planet is dying
from my son,

02:58.553 --> 03:01.639
who learned it from your daughter.
So forgive me for not trusting you.

03:07.979 --> 03:10.815
<i>Launch will commence</i>
<i>in T-minus 30 seconds.</i>

03:12.942 --> 03:15.570
Damn it, Beckert.

03:48.061 --> 03:52.106
No, not me.

03:55.193 --> 03:56.736
Us.

03:58.863 --> 04:01.574
Attention, all Jupiters.
This is John Robinson.

04:02.408 --> 04:06.287
Report to <i>Jupiter 4.</i>
We'll explain when you get here.

04:16.839 --> 04:19.509
People are gathering outside.

04:19.592 --> 04:20.426
Hey.

04:20.510 --> 04:23.054
-I brought this from our Jupiter.

04:24.806 --> 04:26.140
Is there any way I can help?

04:27.183 --> 04:28.726
Do you understand the problem?

04:28.810 --> 04:31.813
Yeah. We only have a defined
amount of fuel to provide thrust.

04:31.896 --> 04:33.856
So we need to make the Jupiter
as light as possible.

04:33.940 --> 04:38.319
Right. So, this is a list of everything
we can strip out that isn't essential.

04:38.403 --> 04:41.406
And this is the maximum weight
we need to reach.

04:49.372 --> 04:51.332
-It's still too heavy.
-Yeah.

04:51.416 --> 04:55.378
I wish I could strip out all of this.
The cockpit alone weighs five tons.

04:55.461 --> 04:58.965
Technically, 9,530 pounds, but...

05:00.383 --> 05:01.884
Too bad you can't pilot without it.

05:06.514 --> 05:08.266
Did I spill something on <i>Friendship 7?</i>

05:12.437 --> 05:15.189
There's been a new development
in our situation.

05:15.815 --> 05:18.901
It seems that our planet is on an orbit

05:18.985 --> 05:21.946
that will bring us dangerously close
to the sun.

05:22.947 --> 05:28.328
So, it's gonna get hotter and hotter,
until it's, um...

05:30.038 --> 05:31.289
Well, it's too hot.

05:32.248 --> 05:33.958
Are you saying the planet is dying?

05:34.834 --> 05:38.921
Not dying. Just entering a phase
malignant to human life.

05:40.965 --> 05:43.217
Thank you for that clarification.

05:43.301 --> 05:47.138
Well, it explains why there's
a rapid increase in seismic activity.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.141
Also the spike in median temperature...

05:50.224 --> 05:51.851
Have you seen your sister?

05:51.934 --> 05:55.063
Um, no. Last time I heard,
she was with Evan's family.

05:55.146 --> 05:56.564
...atmospheric anomalies...

05:56.647 --> 05:57.565
Why?

05:58.274 --> 06:00.818
Uh, nothing. Just seeing if she's okay.

06:01.611 --> 06:04.322
I don't think any of us are okay
right now.

06:04.405 --> 06:05.782
So how long do we have?

06:08.201 --> 06:09.368
Long enough.

06:10.161 --> 06:13.790
I know everyone by now has heard
that we only have enough fuel

06:13.873 --> 06:16.417
for one Jupiter
to make it to the<i> Resolute.</i>

06:16.501 --> 06:18.002
So, whoever goes will send back help.

06:18.086 --> 06:20.004
But if we're gonna get this one
off the ground,

06:20.088 --> 06:22.173
we're gonna have to lose things
we thought we needed.

06:22.548 --> 06:26.844
Like... Like, the navigation system alone
weighs 1.3 tons and--

06:26.928 --> 06:30.181
-You can't take off without navigation.
No, of course not,

06:30.264 --> 06:33.851
but there's no reason that we have
to navigate from inside the Jupiter.

06:33.935 --> 06:38.731
In the early days of spaceflight,
NASA capsules were basically tin cans.

06:38.815 --> 06:41.984
Uh, all the instrumentation was handled
from the ground at mission control.

06:42.068 --> 06:44.654
So...

06:44.737 --> 06:49.158
...we are going to launch off this planet
the old-fashioned way.

06:49.242 --> 06:50.284
How can we...

06:52.662 --> 06:54.705
Welcome to 1962.

08:12.825 --> 08:16.454
You want me to do this
because I'm the best pilot here, right?

08:17.038 --> 08:18.664
You are the best pilot here.

08:19.874 --> 08:23.044
Not just because I weigh 110 pounds?

08:24.629 --> 08:26.088
That helps.

08:27.507 --> 08:31.636
You'd be flying blind. Too dangerous.

08:32.553 --> 08:33.721
No radar. No sensors.

08:35.431 --> 08:37.600
The computer would not be there
to handle any problems.

08:38.434 --> 08:40.394
I was trained for problems.

08:40.853 --> 08:42.730
Think about you daughter!

08:46.025 --> 08:48.319
This'll be just like
the <i>Mercury-Redstone 3,</i>

08:48.402 --> 08:50.071
NASA's first manned mission to space.

08:50.154 --> 08:53.616
The first mission was number three?
As in, the first two blew up?

08:53.699 --> 08:57.870
As in the first two were unmanned.
The Jupiter still needs someone to fly it.

08:59.330 --> 09:00.414
I trust her.

09:02.875 --> 09:03.960
I'm in.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.189
I feel like we should talk.

09:33.823 --> 09:35.783
You promised me you weren't gonna tell.

09:36.951 --> 09:40.705
We sat by a waterfall,
and, granted, it was mud, but whatever.

09:40.788 --> 09:45.001
We sat there and you gave me your word
that you wouldn't.

09:45.793 --> 09:48.170
And I know that it was a lot
to lay on you,

09:48.254 --> 09:53.217
that we're all gonna die in this place,
but honestly, I was scared,

09:53.301 --> 09:54.927
and I didn't know what to do,

09:55.011 --> 09:59.140
and I trusted you, which is not something
I do on a regular basis.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.101
I'm sorry. That's it?

10:07.148 --> 10:09.609
-I gotta go.

10:10.109 --> 10:11.193
What are you doing?

10:15.573 --> 10:16.907
We shouldn't hang out anymore.

10:20.244 --> 10:21.912
Are you breaking up with me?

10:22.747 --> 10:24.165
Breaking up?

10:27.168 --> 10:30.880
We weren't really together or anything,
were we?

10:38.804 --> 10:41.932
You're a bad kisser. So...

10:49.315 --> 10:52.610
Oh, my God, I hate this planet.

11:06.040 --> 11:09.877
Hey, what you working on?

11:09.960 --> 11:13.964
I'm trying to patch the UHF radio
so this Jupiter can be linked to ours.

11:14.048 --> 11:17.134
Oh, yeah Scooch over.

11:23.140 --> 11:24.850
How long you gonna need?

11:24.934 --> 11:27.603
Give me an hour.

11:28.479 --> 11:30.314
Yeah

11:31.649 --> 11:32.900
Two hours.

11:37.321 --> 11:39.699
You've been hanging out with Penny
too much.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.250
Uh...

11:50.835 --> 11:52.795
Beckert hit me with a crowbar.

11:54.213 --> 11:55.589
Is he okay?

11:56.590 --> 11:58.843
Yeah, he'll be sore in the morning.

12:04.306 --> 12:06.725
Could you show me sometime?

12:07.852 --> 12:09.145
Show you what?

12:09.228 --> 12:12.565
What to do if someone
tries to hit me with a crowbar.

12:13.274 --> 12:15.484
Uh... sure.

12:16.485 --> 12:21.282
I mean, maybe we could start
with something a little less intense. Huh?

12:49.393 --> 12:52.813
Okay, great. Once we're done with those,
let's start stripping the med lab.

12:52.897 --> 12:56.025
Mom, I'm being prompted to plug in
the Dhar's security codes.

12:56.859 --> 12:58.235
Okay, I'll talk to Victor.

12:58.694 --> 13:00.863
And then I just need a ride back
to our Jupiter

13:00.946 --> 13:02.948
to reset the ECLSS and GNC.

13:03.032 --> 13:07.369
-Okay, uh, I'll get you a ride.

13:07.953 --> 13:10.414
Is that all right?
-Yeah, I'm only in the way.

13:10.498 --> 13:12.041
Unless people wanna talk about
how they feel

13:12.124 --> 13:13.292
about taking this ship apart.

13:14.710 --> 13:16.086
Okay, great. Thank you.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.560
I need your security codes.

13:32.686 --> 13:36.065
Why not? You've taken everything else.

13:38.609 --> 13:42.530
You know, I want everyone to survive
as much as you do.

13:48.035 --> 13:49.787
You put my family's lives at risk.

13:49.870 --> 13:52.206
-I was going to get help.
-I'm not talking about today.

13:54.041 --> 13:58.003
I stood up for you.
I told them you didn't have it in you.

13:58.087 --> 14:01.090
-The gun.

14:01.173 --> 14:03.467
The one you gave Angela.

14:03.551 --> 14:08.514
When your family's lives are at risk,
you don't think clearly, believe me.

14:09.348 --> 14:11.350
And right now,
you're not thinking clearly. I had nothing to do with that business
with the robot.

14:14.144 --> 14:15.854
I suggest you look somewhere else.

14:24.488 --> 14:25.406
Mom.

14:26.407 --> 14:29.034
Aw, honey, I heard what happened.

14:30.119 --> 14:32.788
There's something I need to tell you
about Dr. Smith.

14:45.801 --> 14:48.095
Are you gonna help
or you just gonna watch?

14:48.470 --> 14:50.347
The math doesn't add up.

14:50.431 --> 14:52.558
Believe me, Maureen's math always adds up.

14:52.641 --> 14:56.687
The way the Jupiters were built on paper
isn't the same as they are in real life.

14:56.770 --> 14:58.856
There are things
that only a mechanic knows.

14:58.939 --> 14:59.773
Such as?

14:59.857 --> 15:03.027
They were over-engineered.
Redundant systems up the wazoo.

15:03.110 --> 15:05.571
Your wife thinks you can strip away
those redundant systems,

15:05.654 --> 15:07.615
and the ones that are left will work.

15:07.698 --> 15:09.575
She's assuming they're perfect,
but they're not.

15:10.034 --> 15:13.037
They're just like people.
They kinda just chug along... some missing the mark,
others picking up the slack.

15:18.334 --> 15:21.045
I love a woman
who can reroute a coolant system,

15:21.128 --> 15:24.006
but we need the whole system.
And it's too heavy.

15:24.089 --> 15:27.217
-There must be something else we can lose.
-There's nothing left.

15:27.635 --> 15:31.639
-Well, we do have the life support system.
We need that.

15:32.056 --> 15:35.267
Yeah, it's fairly important if you wanna,
you know, keep living.

15:36.393 --> 15:37.603
Huh.

15:46.028 --> 15:47.696
-Stay here.
-Be careful.

16:27.361 --> 16:29.822
Oh.

16:29.905 --> 16:31.615
-Hey, Mom.

16:32.408 --> 16:35.244
We were just bringing supplies back
for everyone.

16:37.413 --> 16:40.165
People work better
on a full stomach, right?

16:40.249 --> 16:41.208
Right.

16:43.168 --> 16:44.336
I've got the codes.

16:44.420 --> 16:48.340
They're on my laptop out in the Chariot.
With Judy.

16:52.428 --> 16:53.846
Yeah, thanks, Mom.

16:56.098 --> 16:59.018
You seem stressed out.
Do you need to talk?

16:59.601 --> 17:02.771
No, I'm fine.
I mean, plus or minus a few variables.

17:03.689 --> 17:05.733
Do you really wanna help me?

17:06.567 --> 17:07.651
Of course.

17:07.735 --> 17:11.238
Okay, there's some equipment that we need
down in the garage.

17:21.415 --> 17:22.458
What a morning.

17:23.625 --> 17:25.711
It's crazy what people will do
when they're scared.

17:25.794 --> 17:27.629
Fear is a dangerous thing.

17:28.547 --> 17:32.384
Well, at least we caught him
before he did any real damage.

17:34.845 --> 17:36.972
So what is it we're looking for?

17:38.557 --> 17:41.894
Just, uh, anything to help strip the ship,
you know?

17:42.853 --> 17:46.940
Cordless drill packs, miter saws,
or whatever.

17:47.024 --> 17:50.986
You Robinsons are such a little tribe
of fixer-uppers.

17:53.238 --> 17:58.494
I've learned more in the past few weeks
about repairing engines,

17:58.911 --> 18:02.790
rewiring wires and refueling radios...

18:09.588 --> 18:12.424
-You know who I am.
-No. The truth.

18:16.053 --> 18:17.096
It's complicated.

18:18.263 --> 18:20.265
-Okay.

18:24.478 --> 18:30.234
When the<i> Resolute</i> was evacuated,
the path to my Jupiter was cut off.

18:31.360 --> 18:32.486
And...

18:33.821 --> 18:38.117
I begged anyone I could find
to take me in, but they...

18:39.743 --> 18:44.123
And that's when I saw him.
The real Dr. Smith.

18:45.457 --> 18:46.583
He was hurt...

18:48.418 --> 18:50.129
he was bleeding, and I...

18:53.507 --> 18:59.263
I tried to save him, but I just thought,
"Why should both of us have to die?"

19:02.683 --> 19:04.726
So I took his access tag.

19:06.436 --> 19:09.356
I'm sorry, I should have told you sooner.

19:09.439 --> 19:13.318
-But you were so kind, so generous.

19:14.903 --> 19:16.321
I wanted you to like me.

19:18.448 --> 19:22.578
-Clearly, you wanted more than that.
-Just to survive.

19:24.496 --> 19:26.331
Then why did you give Angela the gun?

19:27.249 --> 19:29.042
Maureen, why would I want to
hurt the people--

19:29.126 --> 19:31.044
I don't know, you tell me.

19:36.216 --> 19:38.343
If I'm wrong, I apologize.

19:38.427 --> 19:39.970
But right now,
I need to protect my family,

19:40.053 --> 19:43.015
and I think the best way to do that
is to keep you away from them.

19:46.643 --> 19:48.145
Jessica Harris.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.481
That's my name.

19:51.857 --> 19:55.360
Look it up in the manifest.
I'm a physicist.

19:55.444 --> 19:57.154
You're a physicist?

19:58.822 --> 20:02.201
-You're asking the wrong questions.

20:02.826 --> 20:08.498
What you should be asking is,
how long was I on that Jupiter today?

20:08.582 --> 20:10.667
The one you're preparing to launch.

20:14.421 --> 20:19.176
What might a woman of my expertise
have done to it?

20:19.259 --> 20:23.639
-You're lying.
-Maybe I am, maybe I'm not.

20:23.722 --> 20:25.515
That ship is your only means of survival.

20:25.599 --> 20:28.769
Let's just say, for the sake of argument,
that it wasn't.

20:29.186 --> 20:31.104
If you did anything
to sabotage that ship--

20:31.188 --> 20:34.566
Here's what I suggest. You let me out.
I come clean.

20:34.650 --> 20:38.362
We both go our separate ways
and call it happily ever after.

20:38.445 --> 20:41.448
-Go to hell.
-We're already there, Maureen.

20:41.740 --> 20:43.033
It's up to you whether or not

20:43.116 --> 20:45.494
your family makes it out
before they get burned.

20:57.839 --> 20:59.341
So, do you believe her?

21:00.342 --> 21:02.636
There was a Jessica Harris
on the<i> Resolute.</i>

21:02.719 --> 21:03.804
That checks out.

21:04.888 --> 21:07.391
And her vitals match, so...

21:09.017 --> 21:11.270
Victor's Jupiter,
you think she messed with it?

21:11.353 --> 21:15.023
No. I think she'd say anything
to save her ass.

21:17.067 --> 21:18.777
No, we'll be fine.

21:22.948 --> 21:24.574
Uh...

21:24.658 --> 21:28.829
Don and I went over the plan.
He thinks the Jupiter's still too heavy,

21:28.912 --> 21:30.998
even after stripping out everything
from your list.

21:31.581 --> 21:34.501
-So we strip more.
-Well, there's not much left.

21:34.584 --> 21:36.586
We're down to life support,
pressure systems,

21:36.670 --> 21:37.671
-servo systems.
-Servo systems.

21:37.754 --> 21:39.715
I mean, can it even fly without those?

21:40.465 --> 21:42.342
-Theoretically.

21:42.426 --> 21:45.429
The Jupiter will hold together, but...

21:46.221 --> 21:49.099
-We might as well strap Naoko to the hood

21:49.182 --> 21:51.518
because that's what it's gonna feel like
when she takes off.

21:52.102 --> 21:55.397
-She will black out.
-Yeah. She will.

21:55.480 --> 21:57.941
There isn't a person alive who wouldn't.

21:58.025 --> 22:02.696
The question is, will she wake up in time
to manually pilot out of the atmosphere?

22:04.197 --> 22:05.657
What if she can't?

22:10.704 --> 22:16.293
Naoko's test results are good.
Full cognitive recovery in 54 seconds.

22:16.626 --> 22:17.753
Is that fast enough?

22:19.379 --> 22:21.882
During liftoff, the Jupiter rises
at one mile per second,

22:21.965 --> 22:24.092
and it's a 70-mile trip
out of this atmosphere

22:24.176 --> 22:26.219
-into the safety of space.
-70 seconds.

22:26.303 --> 22:29.806
Oh, God, and it's a rough 70 seconds.

22:30.390 --> 22:33.101
The pilot will have to manually
steer around atmospheric hazards,

22:33.185 --> 22:36.938
which is hard enough, but at the same time
vent the engines so they don't overheat.

22:37.022 --> 22:39.107
It's basically like threading a needle

22:39.191 --> 22:41.735
when you've just woken up
from a knock-out punch.

22:44.279 --> 22:45.781
She'll never have enough time.

22:49.076 --> 22:52.579
I doubt any of the other survivors
scored high enough to have a shot.

23:01.671 --> 23:07.177
Of course.
Full cognitive recovery in 19 seconds.

23:07.761 --> 23:09.096
There must be somebody else.

23:09.179 --> 23:10.806
That's 35 seconds faster.

23:10.889 --> 23:12.474
That doesn't mean I'm the right person.

23:12.557 --> 23:15.227
When every second counts,
35 seconds is a lot.

23:15.310 --> 23:16.812
-Check again.
-I don't need to.

23:16.895 --> 23:18.271
-Maureen, listen--
-John...

23:18.355 --> 23:21.942
I am not leaving you and the kids.
Not again.

23:25.779 --> 23:27.030
I made a promise.

23:29.533 --> 23:30.867
Then keep it.

23:33.161 --> 23:34.204
How?

23:35.247 --> 23:36.665
Come back safely.

23:47.968 --> 23:49.094
This decision...

23:51.513 --> 23:53.223
It can't be just ours.

23:56.476 --> 23:58.979
I know this isn't easy, so...

24:01.314 --> 24:04.776
Look, the only way I do this
is if we all talk it through.

24:05.777 --> 24:07.362
Okay, let's do pros and cons.

24:07.446 --> 24:11.032
And pro, he's the only one that can do it.

24:11.575 --> 24:13.952
That's not a pro. He might not make it.

24:14.035 --> 24:15.662
Nobody will if he doesn't go.

24:15.745 --> 24:19.124
That's not a pro either. That's a con.
They're all cons.

24:27.924 --> 24:31.386
You sure you'll be okay?
That you'll come back?

24:32.554 --> 24:35.056
If anyone can do this, it's your dad.

24:35.765 --> 24:38.852
Can you promise me he'll make it back?

24:43.523 --> 24:46.109
If I could,
we wouldn't be having this discussion.

24:53.700 --> 24:54.993
What happens if I say no?

25:07.964 --> 25:09.424
Hey. Hey, Will.

25:10.509 --> 25:11.384
Will.

25:13.887 --> 25:15.180
-Hey.
Talk to me.

25:20.560 --> 25:23.772
The robot. I let him die.

25:23.855 --> 25:26.566
I told him it was okay
to walk off the cliff.

25:26.650 --> 25:30.028
And now, you want me
to do the same for you?

25:30.904 --> 25:35.033
Will, I don't wanna do this.

25:35.825 --> 25:37.535
But you have to?

25:37.619 --> 25:41.957
That's what you said three years ago,
when you left.

25:45.168 --> 25:47.087
Not gonna say it's okay for you to go.

25:54.219 --> 25:55.470
Come on now.

25:58.807 --> 26:00.725
Hey, hey. Listen to me.

26:01.935 --> 26:03.186
It's all right.

26:04.813 --> 26:06.606
It's not okay with me either.

26:19.411 --> 26:21.705
If your dad's gonna do this,
he's gonna need our help.

26:22.455 --> 26:25.458
Wait, you said you had two pieces
of information to tell us.

26:25.542 --> 26:26.710
Yeah, what's the second part?

26:29.379 --> 26:30.297
Right.

26:31.506 --> 26:33.508
No one goes anywhere near the garage.

26:39.264 --> 26:40.223
John?

26:42.600 --> 26:46.479
I don't know what Maureen told you,
but I think the pressure...

26:48.023 --> 26:49.190
I think it's getting to her.

26:50.984 --> 26:55.322
Her behavior is a clear indication
of clinical anxiety disorder.

26:56.197 --> 26:57.949
You're wasting your breath, Jessica.

26:58.033 --> 27:00.994
Jessica

27:01.453 --> 27:03.455
Is that who Maureen thinks I am?

27:04.372 --> 27:06.291
-John, this is absurd.

27:07.167 --> 27:09.711
Let me out, and we can help her together.

27:11.963 --> 27:15.216
Do you know why she locked me in here?
Because I spoke up.

27:15.800 --> 27:19.554
I told her I was worried
that she wasn't thinking clearly,

27:20.221 --> 27:22.974
that she might be sending Naoko
to her death.

27:26.645 --> 27:29.564
Only it's not Naoko anymore, is it?

27:31.107 --> 27:34.986
Don't get on that ship, John.
I'm trying to protect you.

27:35.862 --> 27:39.032
You know, over the years,

27:40.659 --> 27:43.286
a lot of people have put their life
in my hands.

27:44.245 --> 27:46.623
But if I had to trust someone with mine,

27:48.375 --> 27:49.542
I'd choose my wife.

27:50.377 --> 27:52.045
Your wife?

27:52.128 --> 27:54.881
You mean the woman who wanted
to take your kids away

27:55.632 --> 27:57.884
and start a whole new life without you?

27:58.968 --> 28:01.471
And now she suddenly claims, let me guess,

28:01.554 --> 28:05.725
that you're the only one
who can fly this Jupiter.

28:06.976 --> 28:08.645
That's convenient.

28:11.481 --> 28:12.607
If I were you,

28:13.358 --> 28:15.402
I'd spend your time
getting your story straight,

28:15.485 --> 28:19.823
because when we get to the<i> Resolute,</i>
and we will get to the<i> Resolute,</i>

28:21.366 --> 28:24.077
it's gonna have to be
a hell of a lot more convincing.

28:27.622 --> 28:30.375
Fly safe. We're all depending on you.

28:36.589 --> 28:38.049
You ready for a practice run?

28:39.592 --> 28:41.845
-Good to go.
-Okay.

28:43.596 --> 28:45.890
So, remember, the actual Jupiter
that you'll be flying,

28:45.974 --> 28:47.976
all these bells and whistles,
they might as well be

28:48.059 --> 28:51.604
actual bells and actual whistles
for all the good they'll do you.

28:51.688 --> 28:53.690
They don't exist.
In fact...

28:53.773 --> 28:55.024
Is that necessary?

28:55.108 --> 28:58.194
You want it to be
as close as possible to reality, right?

28:58.278 --> 28:59.904
You really gonna knock me out?

29:00.989 --> 29:02.532
It's funny you mention that.

29:02.615 --> 29:04.200
So, we'll skip the pre-launch protocols

29:04.284 --> 29:06.494
because you wouldn't be able
to execute them anyway.

29:06.578 --> 29:09.456
You just sit back and let me do the work
until it's time to launch.

29:09.831 --> 29:12.459
But once you're up there,
only you'll be able to steer.

29:12.542 --> 29:14.169
And vent the engines before they explode.

29:14.252 --> 29:15.754
-I know.
Yes. And vent them

29:15.837 --> 29:17.380
before you get out of the atmosphere.

29:17.464 --> 29:19.090
And always vent them away from the sun.

29:19.174 --> 29:21.634
And always be aware of variables.
Something will go wrong.

29:21.968 --> 29:23.094
It always does.

29:25.138 --> 29:26.723
T-minus 30 seconds to liftoff.

29:37.233 --> 29:38.109
Arms up.

29:39.319 --> 29:41.780
What's this for?
-To mimic G-force.

29:41.863 --> 29:44.824
T-minus ten seconds.

29:44.908 --> 29:48.661
-Nine, eight, seven, six...

29:49.412 --> 29:55.835
...five, four, three, two, one, liftoff.

30:05.512 --> 30:08.431
No, don't touch those.
Let the SRBs carry you up.

30:09.307 --> 30:13.019
Okay. You're approaching 9G,
where you're gonna lose consciousness.

30:13.102 --> 30:14.771
I'm cutting your suit pressure
to simulate.

30:15.355 --> 30:19.776
Your cognitive recovery was 19 seconds.
Feel free to improve on that.

30:32.413 --> 30:33.665
Nineteen seconds.

30:34.290 --> 30:36.543
You're nothing if not consistent.
How's your head?

30:36.626 --> 30:38.211
-Foggy.
-Push through.

30:38.294 --> 30:41.339
You're hitting tropospheric winds
at ten o'clock. Roll left.

30:41.798 --> 30:44.551
-Get a handle on those engines.

30:44.968 --> 30:48.263
Pitch 17 degrees.
Correction to climb.

30:48.346 --> 30:50.431
-Too late. You're dead.

30:50.515 --> 30:53.059
Oh, God.

30:57.564 --> 30:58.606
That's okay.

30:59.107 --> 30:59.983
Again.

31:04.571 --> 31:05.446
Okay.

31:08.074 --> 31:12.161
Five, four, three,

31:12.245 --> 31:15.456
two, one, liftoff.

31:24.048 --> 31:25.049
You lost a second.

31:26.092 --> 31:29.095
No, you can't vent towards the sun.
Bank left.

31:29.178 --> 31:31.431
-The Jupiter just exploded. You're dead.

31:31.514 --> 31:32.765
Oh, God.

31:34.517 --> 31:37.520
Yeah, I need a few more seconds
to recover before venting.

31:37.604 --> 31:41.107
-You don't have a few more seconds. Again.

31:41.649 --> 31:47.697
Five, four, three, two, one, liftoff.

31:51.409 --> 31:53.411
-Okay, curveball.

31:54.287 --> 31:56.414
Something's wrong.
Your weight distribution's off.

31:56.497 --> 31:58.207
Which means so is your trajectory.

31:58.291 --> 31:59.459
Course correct.

32:00.835 --> 32:02.921
You just hit the boosters way too hard.

32:03.254 --> 32:06.466
Your brain smashed against
the inside of your skull. It's swelling.

32:06.549 --> 32:07.884
Yeah, but I'm not dead, right Correct.
-Huh.

32:09.385 --> 32:10.303
But now you are.

32:10.386 --> 32:11.596
Oh, God.

32:11.679 --> 32:12.847
Again.

32:17.060 --> 32:20.229
System malfunction. Engines are hot.
Too hot. What do you do?

32:20.939 --> 32:22.023
Uh...

32:22.607 --> 32:23.900
-Vent early.

32:23.983 --> 32:25.944
No, it's too late. You're dead.

32:26.027 --> 32:27.528
Oh!

32:27.862 --> 32:29.405
-Too late. You're dead.
-Oh.

32:29.489 --> 32:31.574
You're dead. Again.

32:34.035 --> 32:35.703
-You're dead.

32:36.871 --> 32:39.040
-Ahhh!
-You're dead.

32:39.123 --> 32:41.334
-Again.

32:42.335 --> 32:44.087
You're dead.
Oh, God.

32:44.170 --> 32:45.421
-Again.

32:45.505 --> 32:47.215
You're dead. Again.

32:47.882 --> 32:50.134
-You're dead.

32:51.219 --> 32:52.428
Dad, are you okay?

32:52.512 --> 32:55.515
Yeah, I just need, uh...
I just need some more reps. -No, you need to stop.
No, he needs to get it right.

32:58.685 --> 33:00.812
As his doctor,
I'm advising that he take a break.

33:01.229 --> 33:04.232
His heart is at serious risk
if he continues like this.

33:04.315 --> 33:07.944
Hey, hey. Maybe we should all
take a break, huh

33:09.821 --> 33:11.781
Yeah, okay. I'll get you some water.

33:15.284 --> 33:16.703
Can you help me take...

33:27.880 --> 33:30.425
Hey, why don't you get some air, huh?

33:33.302 --> 33:34.512
Yeah.

33:38.599 --> 33:41.185
Hey, hey, hey, hey...

33:42.645 --> 33:45.189
-You're letting her get to you.
Who?

33:45.857 --> 33:50.153
Smith. Whatever her name is.

33:50.653 --> 33:54.073
I would be worried about you making it
even if she hadn't said anything.

33:54.824 --> 33:56.909
Why don't we take a couple of extra days?

33:59.078 --> 34:00.246
Relieve some of the pressure.

34:01.039 --> 34:06.002
I mean, you could run a comb
over the Jupiter, and I can work on this.

34:06.544 --> 34:09.213
Okay.
-Okay.

34:09.881 --> 34:11.382
Mom?

34:12.216 --> 34:13.551
You should put on the radio.

34:14.427 --> 34:16.596
<i>-</i>The<i> Resolute.</i>

34:21.100 --> 34:23.853
<i>Engineers have detected</i>
<i>evidence of Hawking radiation,</i>

34:23.936 --> 34:25.563
<i>which indicates the presence</i>

34:25.646 --> 34:27.398
<i>-of a gravitational singularity.</i>
-The black hole.

34:27.482 --> 34:28.900
<i>To protect the lives onboard,</i>

34:28.983 --> 34:33.196
<i>we'll be forced to vacate</i>
<i>the current orbit 24 hours from now.</i>

34:33.780 --> 34:36.532
<i>This decision was not made lightly. </i>

34:36.616 --> 34:38.576
<i>We are aware that some of you</i>
<i>are still out there,</i>

34:38.659 --> 34:41.287
<i>trying to make it back. </i>
<i>So, it's with a heavy heart </i>

34:41.370 --> 34:44.665
<i>that the surviving members</i>
<i>of the</i> Resolute<i> 24th Colony Group</i>

34:44.749 --> 34:46.250
<i>-send this final broadcast.</i>
-No!

34:46.334 --> 34:47.168
24 hours.

34:47.251 --> 34:49.796
-No, no! That's not enough time.
I can be ready.

34:49.879 --> 34:53.466
That's not enough time.
I can be ready. I can.

34:53.549 --> 34:55.343
You sure?
-Yeah.

35:00.681 --> 35:01.808
Hey, where are you going?

35:02.558 --> 35:04.060
To the <i>Jupiter 4.</i>

35:05.353 --> 35:07.939
A lot of people have been doing
unsupervised work there.

35:08.022 --> 35:09.774
I wanna check it. Again.

35:17.532 --> 35:20.535
Hey, guys. So why don't you
go get your gear ready?

35:21.702 --> 35:24.122
We're gonna be back
on the<i> Resolute</i> tomorrow. Together.

35:25.164 --> 35:26.082
Huh?

35:27.166 --> 35:28.918
Come on, let's get going.

35:31.254 --> 35:33.923
Yeah, guys. Come on, let's go.

35:36.551 --> 35:38.553
-It's okay.
Yeah.

35:52.984 --> 35:54.110
Hmm.

35:58.156 --> 35:59.574
What did you tell my parents?

36:00.950 --> 36:02.827
Will, is that you?

36:07.540 --> 36:09.167
I'm not supposed to talk to you.

36:11.836 --> 36:13.254
Then don't.

36:17.258 --> 36:20.011
I don't want you to get caught up in this.

36:30.271 --> 36:31.314
In what?

36:33.566 --> 36:35.276
It's really not my place.

36:35.860 --> 36:37.195
It's just...

36:38.905 --> 36:42.658
Some people think
that kids aren't mature enough

36:42.742 --> 36:44.160
to handle the truth.

36:44.577 --> 36:47.997
-The mission.

36:48.831 --> 36:51.292
Has your mother told you
how dangerous it is?

36:51.709 --> 36:54.003
Yeah, she told us all about it.

36:56.339 --> 36:57.256
Wow.

37:00.384 --> 37:02.261
You're such a strong kid.

37:05.473 --> 37:06.474
I mean...

37:09.060 --> 37:13.105
I don't think I could let my dad
sacrifice himself,

37:13.940 --> 37:17.109
even if it did get everyone
off this planet.

37:17.193 --> 37:18.694
He's not sacrificing.

37:20.071 --> 37:21.530
He's gonna make it.

37:22.198 --> 37:23.950
He said he'll be fine.

37:26.035 --> 37:31.165
I was about your age
when my dad went into the hospital.

37:31.749 --> 37:35.127
And I remember, everyone was there,
and when I asked what was going on,

37:36.045 --> 37:40.591
they told me not to worry,
that he was going to be fine.

37:42.176 --> 37:46.514
Turns out everyone was just saying that...

37:49.267 --> 37:51.602
because they didn't want me to be sad.

37:54.730 --> 37:56.315
But when he died...

37:57.858 --> 37:59.360
it hurt so much.

37:59.986 --> 38:03.030
Would it have been easier
if I'd been able to prepare for it?

38:04.448 --> 38:05.283
Maybe.

38:09.203 --> 38:14.875
Sometimes parents think they have to lie
to protect their kids.

38:16.377 --> 38:19.046
But friends can be honest with each other.

38:19.505 --> 38:24.677
And right now,
I'm the only one telling the truth.

38:26.637 --> 38:30.933
There's a chance that Jupiter
makes it to the<i> Resolute,</i>

38:31.517 --> 38:35.604
but whoever flies it
won't survive the trip.

38:36.439 --> 38:40.192
-No, but my mom, she said--
-Is a very intelligent woman...

38:41.902 --> 38:43.654
but she doesn't know everything.

38:45.031 --> 38:48.701
She doesn't know there's someone else
who can fly this Jupiter.

38:48.784 --> 38:50.202
It doesn't have to be your dad.

38:51.370 --> 38:53.080
Will, where are you?

38:54.373 --> 38:55.583
I have to go.

38:55.666 --> 38:59.045
Will, listen to me.
-I can't.

39:07.345 --> 39:10.222
I don't go to your place and triple check
your rocket science stuff.

39:10.306 --> 39:12.433
Sorry, I just need to make sure
there's nothing wrong.

39:12.516 --> 39:14.769
You do know
that's literally my job, right?

39:14.852 --> 39:17.021
-To make sure nothing's wrong with these.

39:17.104 --> 39:19.648
1967, <i>Soyuz 1,</i> parachute failure.

39:19.732 --> 39:22.485
1971, <i>Soyuz 11,</i> cabin vent valve.

39:22.568 --> 39:25.154
1986, <i>Challenger,</i> faulty O-ring seal.

39:25.237 --> 39:29.325
2003, <i>Columbia,</i>
damaged thermal protection system.

39:29.408 --> 39:33.329
Everyone died in these accidents
and you know what they all have in common?

39:35.247 --> 39:37.625
A mechanic cleared them for launch.

39:37.708 --> 39:41.253
You know what else they have in common?
Don West wasn't born yet.

39:41.629 --> 39:45.466
Now call me thorough, call me lucky,
but nothing's ever gone wrong on my watch.

39:45.549 --> 39:47.218
Weren't you working on the<i> Resolute?</i>

39:47.301 --> 39:49.804
-We were attacked by an alien robot.
-On your watch.

39:51.722 --> 39:53.933
Okay. I'm sorry. I'm...

39:56.602 --> 39:59.146
This is our last chance.

39:59.897 --> 40:01.273
And my husband...

40:02.983 --> 40:05.236
My husband's gonna be up there
hurtling through space,

40:05.319 --> 40:06.612
and I don't know if he can--

40:06.695 --> 40:10.324
You're not the only one
who needs this to work, Mrs. Robinson.

40:16.622 --> 40:18.958
Maybe there's something
you can do to help us.

40:20.793 --> 40:23.337
Finally, this guy's reading
the directions.

40:23.421 --> 40:27.133
Yeah. I'm not normally
reduced to this, but, um...

40:28.509 --> 40:29.927
Get the weight down on the Jupiter?

40:30.010 --> 40:33.264
Oh, like any good fighter,
she had to shed the last few pounds.

40:33.347 --> 40:36.142
But we're actually 200 under,
if you can believe it.

40:36.225 --> 40:40.354
Pretty sure the CPDS took us over the top.
All she needs now is a good pilot.

40:40.813 --> 40:43.232
John's recovery time is excellent.
But given the variables,

40:43.315 --> 40:45.776
he can't quite pilot
and vent simultaneously.

40:46.193 --> 40:48.821
-20 seconds.

40:48.904 --> 40:51.824
-You can get away with 30.
-But standard iteration--

40:51.907 --> 40:54.285
Standard iteration's
for standard situations. With such low fuel pressure to begin with,
vent too soon,

40:57.371 --> 40:58.789
you won't make it into orbit.

40:59.165 --> 41:01.792
Vent every 30. She can take it.

41:03.794 --> 41:05.421
Maybe we should put the CPDS back in.

41:05.504 --> 41:08.466
Mmm. That's over 700 pounds.

41:08.549 --> 41:10.342
We've only got 200 to play with.

41:15.848 --> 41:17.725
You're, like, 174

41:25.274 --> 41:28.319
Wait a minute. No. See what you're doing.

41:28.402 --> 41:30.821
You know these ships better than anyone.
Who better to be there

41:30.905 --> 41:32.615
-if something goes wrong--
-Stop. I'm sorry.

41:32.698 --> 41:35.326
I'm the wrong guy, okay?
Good luck with that.

41:35.409 --> 41:37.244
Send me a postcard. Hi. Bye.

41:37.953 --> 41:39.872
Don. Don, stop.

41:41.499 --> 41:44.376
-This is about my dad's life.
-Yeah. It's my life, too.

41:44.460 --> 41:46.420
Look, he can't do it on his own, okay?

41:46.504 --> 41:48.797
And if he doesn't make it,
then it is all of our lives.

41:48.881 --> 41:49.882
Ease off.

41:50.549 --> 41:52.468
Is this about money again?

41:53.052 --> 41:54.678
I thought we were past that.

41:54.762 --> 41:58.182
No one's ever really past money.
But it has nothing to do with that.

41:59.225 --> 42:01.435
Then what is it gonna take for you
to do the right thing?

42:02.561 --> 42:05.314
You know what "doing the right thing"
has done for me?

42:05.814 --> 42:08.150
Save a lady in the desert,
get left for dead.

42:08.234 --> 42:12.029
Flip a tanker for you,
lose a very comfortable retirement.

42:12.112 --> 42:15.282
So, from where I'm standing,
doing the right thing kinda sucks.

42:21.080 --> 42:23.791
No. I'm not gonna do it.

42:24.375 --> 42:27.378
Nope. Nope, nope, nope. No.

42:30.130 --> 42:30.965
Son of a...

42:32.007 --> 42:33.968
If anyone asks, I got paid for this.

42:34.051 --> 42:35.427
-A lot.
-Mmm-hmm.

42:35.511 --> 42:37.012
And I want a medal.

42:37.346 --> 42:38.722
-Ten...
No. A parade.

42:38.806 --> 42:40.474
-No. I want a holiday.
-...nine, eight...

42:41.058 --> 42:43.769
-Don West Appreciation Day.
-...seven, six...

42:43.852 --> 42:45.729
-Colony Salvation Day for Don West.
-...five,

42:45.813 --> 42:47.898
-four, three...
-I want my face on a postage stamp.

42:48.399 --> 42:52.194
-...two, one, liftoff.

42:57.408 --> 42:59.702
What kind of a torture chamber
have you got going on?

42:59.785 --> 43:00.953
-Nighty-night.

43:01.036 --> 43:02.788
I'm swallowing my tongue...

43:10.212 --> 43:12.047
Okay, you woke up a bit slow,
but that's all right.

43:12.131 --> 43:14.925
I need you to roll 15 degrees
to your left.

43:16.677 --> 43:19.013
That's it. Okay, hit thrusters.

43:19.638 --> 43:20.973
23-degree pitch.

43:22.516 --> 43:25.227
-Excellent. Now hold steady.

43:27.646 --> 43:29.815
Now, Don, vent the engines.

43:34.153 --> 43:35.112
Don!

43:36.822 --> 43:39.575
What was his recovery time?
Couldn't find a result.

43:39.658 --> 43:42.077
A-plus. I scored an A-plus.

43:48.751 --> 43:52.713
-And... you've hit escape velocity.

43:52.796 --> 43:54.423
Welcome to space!

43:54.506 --> 43:55.841
Yes!

43:58.218 --> 44:00.304
Nailed it.
Great job, Dad.

44:02.598 --> 44:07.519
I'm also here. Being brave and awesome.
Doing the right thing or whatever.

44:08.437 --> 44:09.521
Yeah, no one cares.

44:10.856 --> 44:13.359
-Tonight, we do it for real.

44:13.442 --> 44:15.110
Shouldn't we run the test one more time?

44:19.281 --> 44:21.367
We don't have any more time.

45:27.391 --> 45:30.144
Dr. Robinson, I got something for ya.

45:30.602 --> 45:32.938
Don.
No, no, don't get excited.

45:33.021 --> 45:34.565
-It's not a present.

45:34.648 --> 45:36.567
Mmm, I don't want your chicken.

45:36.650 --> 45:40.279
And I don't wanna hurl through space
in a Thermos, but here we are.

45:40.529 --> 45:44.032
Listen, I left instructions in there.
What she eats, when she eats.

45:44.116 --> 45:46.243
And if you need to put her to sleep,
all you gotta do,

45:46.326 --> 45:48.412
turn over, stroke her belly
ever so gently...

45:48.495 --> 45:51.290
-Okay, I'll see what I can do.
-...and she'll purr like a little-- Okay.

45:51.790 --> 45:53.333
-Bye, Debbie.

46:20.694 --> 46:22.362
He'll be all right.

46:25.991 --> 46:29.077
All right, I'm gonna go inside.

46:29.161 --> 46:30.704
Pre-launch protocols start soon.

46:30.787 --> 46:33.624
-Okay, let's go.
-Yep. Yeah. Let's go.

46:51.141 --> 46:53.101
Do you think we'll be able to see it
from up here?

46:54.645 --> 46:55.979
We should.

47:01.819 --> 47:03.028
Hey, where's Will? Oh, uh...

47:05.155 --> 47:06.907
I think he's too nervous to watch.

47:17.167 --> 47:19.169
You said someone else
could pilot the Jupiter.

47:20.087 --> 47:22.923
Come closer and I'll show you.

47:36.853 --> 47:41.441
We could bring it back.
You and me. Together.

47:42.776 --> 47:44.111
I can't.

47:44.194 --> 47:48.490
But it was only bad
because you told it to be bad, remember?

47:48.991 --> 47:52.452
What if... What if we start it over

47:53.036 --> 47:55.414
and you told it to be good?

47:56.415 --> 47:58.375
He could fly that ship.

48:00.335 --> 48:02.588
All you have to do is open this door,

48:03.714 --> 48:05.382
and your father can come home.

48:29.740 --> 48:35.996
Upon returning home, Akiyama Toyohiro,
first Japanese citizen in space, said...

48:41.418 --> 48:42.252
What does that mean?

48:42.628 --> 48:44.463
Huh.

48:47.883 --> 48:49.593
Fly safe, John Robinson.

49:45.482 --> 49:48.276
Jupiter 4,
<i>this is </i>Jupiter 2. <i>Do you copy?</i>

49:48.694 --> 49:51.989
<i>Jupiter 2,</i> this is <i>Jupiter 4. </i>Copy.

49:57.202 --> 49:58.912
Final pre-launch protocol. Seals, check.

50:03.291 --> 50:04.751
<i>Internal power, check.</i>

50:05.127 --> 50:07.629
Fuel pre-press, check.

50:09.339 --> 50:10.716
<i>All systems go.</i>

50:12.300 --> 50:15.971
Copy, <i>Jupiter 2.</i> Permission to launch?

50:18.140 --> 50:19.725
Permission granted.

50:20.726 --> 50:25.772
Launch will commence
in T-minus 60 seconds.

50:26.648 --> 50:27.774
Affirmative.

50:29.067 --> 50:31.028
-Maureen.

50:34.656 --> 50:35.532
I love you.

50:38.535 --> 50:39.870
I love you, too.

50:42.622 --> 50:43.498
I love you, too.

50:46.793 --> 50:48.795
<i>Okay. </i>

50:49.629 --> 50:51.006
See you in a bit.

51:03.727 --> 51:05.812
You're set for liftoff in...

51:07.439 --> 51:09.357
T-minus ten,

51:10.192 --> 51:14.863
<i>-nine, eight, seven...</i>

51:14.946 --> 51:17.741
...six, five,

51:18.450 --> 51:22.537
<i>-four, three, two...</i>

51:24.456 --> 51:25.457
...liftoff.

51:50.273 --> 51:51.316
Go!

51:51.817 --> 51:53.485
Go, go, go!
Looks good.

52:18.385 --> 52:23.056
Come on. You can do it.
Come on. Come on.

52:43.743 --> 52:44.870
John?

52:47.455 --> 52:49.291
John, come back to me.

52:50.542 --> 52:51.960
<i>I'm here.</i>

52:55.881 --> 52:59.426
We're here.  Pretty dark in here.

52:59.509 --> 53:01.094
That's okay, I've got you.

53:03.513 --> 53:06.474
Winds at your eight o'clock,
real ones this time.

53:10.312 --> 53:12.898
<i>They're coming in</i>
<i>at just over 500 miles per hour.</i>

53:12.981 --> 53:15.942
Got it. Don?

53:18.320 --> 53:19.988
Whoa.

53:21.031 --> 53:22.782
What? Uh...

53:22.866 --> 53:23.783
Don?

53:25.160 --> 53:29.664
Uh, yeah. Yep. Yeah, let's, uh... let's...

53:31.917 --> 53:33.460
Let's nothing. I need a sec here.

53:33.543 --> 53:36.713
Don, engines are getting hot.
We need to vent.

53:37.297 --> 53:39.841
The hull's facing away
from the sun, partner.

53:40.258 --> 53:41.968
-I'm...

53:44.012 --> 53:45.597
John, you need to take over.

53:45.680 --> 53:47.390
No, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

53:47.474 --> 53:49.768
If we do it too soon,
we won't make it out.

53:49.851 --> 53:51.061
Don, you need to vent now.

53:51.144 --> 53:53.647
She can take it.
Just give me five more seconds.

53:58.151 --> 53:58.985
Now!

54:14.376 --> 54:17.587
Okay.  Okay, well done.

54:18.964 --> 54:20.256
<i>You're almost there.</i>

54:21.216 --> 54:22.509
You're a lucky man.

54:22.592 --> 54:26.304
Yeah, well...
I brought some luck with me.

54:33.436 --> 54:34.562
Maureen?

54:34.980 --> 54:36.231
Noctilucent clouds.

54:38.441 --> 54:39.526
Hold position.

54:40.902 --> 54:41.778
Maureen.

54:49.369 --> 54:51.997
It's getting pretty punchy in here.

54:52.580 --> 54:55.875
Just a few more seconds.
Continue to hold position.

54:55.959 --> 54:56.960
<i>Holding.</i>

54:59.462 --> 55:01.047
Okay, easy now.

55:01.548 --> 55:07.137
I want you to slow engines to 25%
and roll 48 degrees to

55:08.054 --> 55:10.181
<i>Maureen</i>

55:10.265 --> 55:12.976
<i>Left or right</i>
<i>48 degrees left or...</i>
