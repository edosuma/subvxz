<i>Previously on Nashville...</i>

00:02.818 --> 00:03.998
I love you.

00:03.999 --> 00:05.433
It didn't mean anything.

00:05.434 --> 00:08.289
I'm so happy that you
agreed to open for Juliette.

00:08.290 --> 00:10.718
Win back those fans
and those radio stations

00:10.719 --> 00:12.033
one city at a time.

00:12.034 --> 00:13.282
Luke: I knew as soon as I heard it

00:13.283 --> 00:14.933
it was gonna be a hit single. Cheers.

00:14.934 --> 00:16.585
Have you ever worked as
a backup singer before?

00:16.586 --> 00:18.671
This is a recording of my church solo.

00:18.981 --> 00:21.094
- Maddie Claybourne.
- What?

00:21.095 --> 00:23.544
Now I understand why Deacon always
seems to be in the middle of it.

00:23.545 --> 00:25.468
It was a terrible, awful mistake.

00:25.469 --> 00:26.661
What was a mistake?

00:26.662 --> 00:27.882
We're done. Do you get that?

00:27.883 --> 00:28.853
Where are you going?

00:28.854 --> 00:30.334
You don't get to know that anymore, okay?!

Hey.

01:02.357 --> 01:03.944
[Sighs] How you doin'?

01:04.778 --> 01:07.611
Listen, I-I know what I said
about needing time and all that,

01:07.612 --> 01:09.896
but I shouldn't have reacted
the way I did, and I'm sorry.

01:09.897 --> 01:11.900
Man, it got crazy last night.

01:11.901 --> 01:13.042
[Chuckling] Yeah.

01:13.447 --> 01:14.587
The thing is...

01:14.973 --> 01:18.149
[Sighs] I got a sore spot
when it comes to Deacon.

01:18.666 --> 01:19.863
You do?

01:19.864 --> 01:21.130
Yeah, it goes way back.

01:21.131 --> 01:23.595
You remember the '92 Oklahoma state fair?

01:23.596 --> 01:25.563
- Yeah, you know I do.
- Yeah.

01:26.044 --> 01:28.326
Two of us stuck up on the
top of that Ferris wheel...

01:28.327 --> 01:30.495
best seats in the house
for the George Strait show.

01:30.496 --> 01:31.826
Yeah, but before that.

01:31.827 --> 01:33.513
Before we hit the midway,

01:33.514 --> 01:35.937
you know, we were still
a bunch of nobodies,

01:35.938 --> 01:38.044
had to play that tent
outside the livestock,

01:38.045 --> 01:39.520
and you were about to start your set,

01:39.521 --> 01:42.487
but couldn't find Deacon anywhere.

01:42.488 --> 01:44.040
And you sat in for him.

01:44.041 --> 01:45.395
- Yeah.
- I remember.

01:45.724 --> 01:48.251
Never could understand how you
put up with it all those years...

01:48.252 --> 01:50.861
the way he treated you,
the way he disappeared.

01:50.862 --> 01:52.080
Anyway...

01:53.052 --> 01:55.531
You were still pretty torn
up about it after your set,

01:55.532 --> 01:59.407
so I thought, you know, "maybe this is it.

01:59.408 --> 02:00.663
"Maybe...

02:01.632 --> 02:05.667
This is the night she finally... Sees me."

02:07.394 --> 02:10.780
But even alone together on top
of the world in that Ferris wheel

02:10.781 --> 02:13.239
with George Strait
singing "Cross my Heart,"

02:13.923 --> 02:16.101
all you could talk about was Deacon.

02:16.637 --> 02:18.399
That's how it was back then.

02:18.400 --> 02:21.484
But we're here now, right?

02:21.485 --> 02:22.597
Mm-hmm.

02:22.598 --> 02:24.622
- And I'm damn happy about it.
- Me too.

02:24.623 --> 02:26.161
[Cellphone rings, vibrates]

02:26.162 --> 02:28.450
- Oh, this is Bucky. I should probably...
- No.

02:28.451 --> 02:29.551
Hey.

02:30.633 --> 02:31.594
That's impossible.

02:31.595 --> 02:34.225
It told her to take it
down, and she said she did.

02:34.745 --> 02:36.577

02:39.635 --> 02:41.221

to know how people are.</i>

02:41.222 --> 02:42.878
<i>Everybody loves a dirty, little secret,</i>

02:44.584 --> 02:46.224
<i>Oh, God, really? A love child?</i>

02:46.225 --> 02:48.091
<i>Jenny, listen, her mom is Rayna Jaymes,</i>

02:48.092 --> 02:50.767
<i>and then her father is
supposedly the mayor of Nashville,</i>

02:50.768 --> 02:52.353

people what this girl can do</i>

03:21.929 --> 03:24.494

something other than you to talk about.

03:24.495 --> 03:26.932
She's a kid. I'd rather them talk about me.

<i>♪ So he... ♪</i>

03:29.321 --> 03:31.125
So, how's the house for tomorrow?

03:31.126 --> 03:32.409
Better than Portland.

03:32.784 --> 03:34.882
Chicago is four times the size of Portland,

03:34.883 --> 03:36.951
so it'd just about have to be, wouldn't it?

03:36.952 --> 03:38.076
True.

03:38.077 --> 03:39.497
But "better than Portland"

03:39.498 --> 03:42.009
sounds more optimistic than "half full."

03:42.010 --> 03:43.974
And the country stations
still won't bring me in?

03:43.975 --> 03:44.918
Not even here?

03:44.919 --> 03:46.285
I have tried. Believe me.

03:46.286 --> 03:47.594
The only reason why I signed with Rayna

03:47.595 --> 03:49.535
is so that I could get back
into country's good graces,

03:49.536 --> 03:51.683
and that is not happening.

03:51.684 --> 03:53.437
Without country radio, I'm dead.

03:53.438 --> 03:55.565
They won't play me. They won't promote me.

03:55.566 --> 03:58.402
If only you knew somebody high
up in the radio business...

03:59.433 --> 04:01.334
Someone who might be willing to help,

04:01.335 --> 04:03.478
someone who just happens to be in Chicago

04:04.566 --> 04:06.209
right this very minute.

04:14.336 --> 04:15.490
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:15.899 --> 04:17.446
Oh, stay a little longer.

recording all day today.

04:21.312 --> 04:22.725
Got to take advantage of the time off,

04:22.726 --> 04:25.329

All righty.

04:41.817 --> 04:44.360
We got some coffee and some warm biscuits.

04:44.894 --> 04:46.422
Uh, they didn't have any raspberry jam,

04:46.423 --> 04:47.929
so I got blackberry.

04:47.930 --> 04:49.949
Hey. New head shots, right?

04:49.950 --> 04:52.644
What do you think about
this one? Too slutty?

04:52.645 --> 04:53.791
Well, you know, as a guy,

04:53.792 --> 04:56.209
there's no such thing as
"too slutty," so it's good.

04:56.210 --> 04:57.514
Shut up. [Chuckles]

04:57.515 --> 05:01.025
Oh, this was messengered
over while you were gone.

05:01.988 --> 05:06.656
Okay, I think I've narrowed
it down to three poses.

05:06.980 --> 05:10.700
What do you think...
fun, mysterious, or sexy?

05:13.744 --> 05:14.998
What is it?

05:17.292 --> 05:18.562
My royalties.

05:18.563 --> 05:20.684
$400,000?!

Oh! Oh, my God!

I'm sorry. I overslept.

05:33.998 --> 05:35.474
Surprise!

05:35.475 --> 05:37.298
Mama? [Chuckles]

05:37.299 --> 05:38.796
Wha... what are you doing here?

05:38.797 --> 05:40.188
You always say you have to work.

05:40.189 --> 05:42.466
Oh, don't even talk to me about work.

05:42.467 --> 05:44.989
The manager of that place was such a bitch.

05:44.990 --> 05:46.712
I do not know what her damage was.

05:46.713 --> 05:48.091
I think she was jealous of me or something

05:48.092 --> 05:50.411
because she started lying
about me to the owner

05:50.412 --> 05:53.437
and one thing led to another
and I just said good riddance.

05:53.438 --> 05:55.375
You know how those things
go? It happens, you know?

05:55.376 --> 05:56.206
Oh. Yeah, it happens. [Sighs]

05:56.207 --> 05:58.873
Oh! Wait till you see
what I brought you. Oh.

05:59.846 --> 06:03.073
Look at this beautiful,
beautiful thing from the airport.

06:03.074 --> 06:05.486
It's the Mississippi river to
remind you of home. [Chuckles]

06:05.487 --> 06:07.321
It's beautiful. Thank you.

two of you were back together.

Oh, no, no. We're not together, mama.

06:25.063 --> 06:27.012
I'm producing Scarlett's album.

06:27.013 --> 06:28.434
We're recording it on the road.

06:28.435 --> 06:30.614
And we're actually running
late, so I got to go.

06:30.615 --> 06:32.146
Well, I'll get my purse.

Well, then, how did it end
up on national television?

07:15.015 --> 07:17.262
Someone must have re-posted
it. What about Colt?

07:17.263 --> 07:18.391
He had the link on his iPad.

07:18.392 --> 07:20.325
No, I told him that he couldn't
post anything about you and Daphne.

07:20.326 --> 07:21.664
Oh, and I suppose your teenager

07:21.665 --> 07:24.440
- just does whatever you tell him to do.
- Teddy, he knew the girls were off-limits.

07:24.441 --> 07:25.786
- I hate this!
- Rayna: I know, honey.

go upstairs, we'll read a book,

Rayna: Doesn't matter how
that video got out there.

07:43.640 --> 07:46.494
Point is, it's out there, and
we're gonna have to fix it, okay?

07:46.495 --> 07:48.583
Okay. I'm gonna call for a
press conference, all right?

07:48.584 --> 07:49.664
I don't want to call a press conference.

07:49.665 --> 07:50.984
I don't want a bunch of people badgering us

about stuff that's none
of their damn business.

07:52.339 --> 07:53.976
Okay, fine. Fine. Then what do you suggest?

07:53.977 --> 07:56.724
I suggest that we put out a press release.

07:56.725 --> 07:59.288
We tell them this is a personal
matter about our children,

07:59.289 --> 08:01.420
- and we ask them to respect our privacy.
- Well, good luck with that,

don't respect our privacy.</i>

at the school. [Sniffles]

A-a statement is not gonna be
enough, not in this day and age.

08:08.295 --> 08:10.906
No way. Not... not with the
Internet and this 24-hour news cycle.

08:10.907 --> 08:12.676
It's not gonna go away by itself, Rayna.

08:21.154 --> 08:22.484
Okay.

08:24.759 --> 08:26.589
We just tell them the story.

08:29.104 --> 08:31.625
We're gonna have to be a united front.

- I'm going with you.
- No, you're not.

No, Rayna, I can't help
but think this is my fault.

She's right. He had the video.

08:43.503 --> 08:45.527

was one of his friends.

<i>I am serious. I am 100% serious.</i>

09:09.207 --> 09:10.297
We need to celebrate.

09:10.298 --> 09:13.291
<i>We do need to celebrate,
but we can do that here.</i>

09:13.292 --> 09:14.581
I have a meeting tomorrow.

09:14.582 --> 09:16.045
Yeah, all right. Yeah.

09:16.046 --> 09:17.902
Hey, can we buy a
motorcycle? Just... [Chuckles]

09:17.903 --> 09:20.734
You know what? I'm gonna hold
onto this for the next 48 hours,

09:21.048 --> 09:22.704
give you a chance to calm down.

09:23.030 --> 09:24.277
What? So you're gonna sit there

09:24.278 --> 09:26.651
and pretend like you're not
holding a check for 400 grand?

09:26.652 --> 09:27.961
It's not my money.

09:27.962 --> 09:30.013
Besides, my meeting
tomorrow's with the agency.

09:30.014 --> 09:33.298
[Chuckling] They already think I'm
a wide-eyed hick from the sticks.

09:33.299 --> 09:34.361
[Scoffs] You should've seen their faces

09:34.362 --> 09:36.345
when I handed them that
cd of me singin' in church

09:36.346 --> 09:39.791
like it was a real demo...
I looked like an idiot.

09:41.930 --> 09:44.552
Okay, wait. I know how I want to celebrate.

09:44.553 --> 09:46.084
It's... it's right here in Nashville.

09:46.085 --> 09:47.840
It is not dangerous.

09:48.422 --> 09:50.040
And most of all, it's
not even a splurge, okay?

09:50.041 --> 09:52.625
It's a necessity. Come on. Trust me.

09:52.626 --> 09:53.699
Grab your things.

09:53.700 --> 09:54.887
Where we going?

09:55.549 --> 09:56.579
Trust me.

09:57.424 --> 09:58.722
Reporter: We go live...

09:59.229 --> 10:00.425
Good lord.

10:00.426 --> 10:01.858
Luke: Must be a slow news day.

10:01.859 --> 10:03.004
Man, these people.

10:03.005 --> 10:04.540
I don't see Deacon's truck.

10:05.414 --> 10:06.913
- Where is he?
- You worried?

10:07.638 --> 10:09.880
You know what happened when
he found out about Maddie.

10:09.881 --> 10:11.645
Uh, you know, and he's
bounced back from that,

10:11.646 --> 10:13.049
and he's got a relationship now.

10:13.050 --> 10:14.977
But I don't know how
he's gonna react to this.

10:14.978 --> 10:16.365
He's a volatile guy.

10:16.366 --> 10:18.874
- You think he's drinkin' again?
- I hope not.

10:18.875 --> 10:21.276
For Maddie's sake. You
know, she loves him so much.

10:21.277 --> 10:24.956
Okay, suppose, I mean, worst
case, he is on a bender.

10:24.957 --> 10:26.077
Where should we look?

10:26.078 --> 10:27.259
I know where to look.

10:27.260 --> 10:29.425
I just... I feel like I
should probably go by myself.

10:29.426 --> 10:30.525
[Chuckling] Yeah, like hell.

10:30.526 --> 10:32.632
I know what Deacon's like when he's drunk.

10:32.633 --> 10:34.019
If you're going, I'm coming with you.

10:37.642 --> 10:40.802
I know it doesn't look like
much, but gets the job done.

10:41.143 --> 10:42.679
Wow.

10:42.680 --> 10:45.571
Recording sure has changed since my day.

10:45.572 --> 10:47.820
Looks like you could practically
cut an album on your phone.

10:48.654 --> 10:49.989
Play me something.

10:50.481 --> 10:51.501
Avery: Uh...

10:52.070 --> 10:54.225
I-I'm not really comfortable with that.

10:54.226 --> 10:57.509
I mean, uh, the mixes aren't
done, tracks are missing.

10:57.510 --> 10:58.711
He's a perfectionist.

10:58.712 --> 11:00.857
Hey. Sorry. I was just looking for Avery.

11:00.858 --> 11:02.465
Juliette Barnes.

11:02.466 --> 11:04.534
This is my mother... Beverly O'Connor.

11:04.535 --> 11:07.144
Oh, your mama. Nice to meet you.

11:07.145 --> 11:08.622
Well, nice to meet you, too.

11:08.623 --> 11:10.518
I feel like we're practically
family at this point.

11:10.519 --> 11:11.760
You've had my brother on your tour

11:11.761 --> 11:13.771
and got my daughter on your tour,

11:13.772 --> 11:16.013
and next time, you're
just gonna have to take me.

11:16.014 --> 11:17.300
Are you in the business?

11:17.301 --> 11:20.771
Well, Deacon and I used to write
together and sing around town.

11:20.772 --> 11:22.618
And I was actually the one that
said, "let's go to Nashville,"

11:22.619 --> 11:26.216
but then I had Scarlett,
so there went that idea.

11:26.217 --> 11:27.678
[Chuckles]

11:27.679 --> 11:29.005
You were lookin' for me?

11:29.307 --> 11:31.466
Yes. Can I talk to you for a second?

11:31.467 --> 11:32.485
Sure.

11:32.486 --> 11:33.803
Be right back.

11:39.034 --> 11:40.414
Well, well.

11:40.415 --> 11:43.144
On tour with Luke Wheeler
and Juliette Barnes,

11:43.145 --> 11:46.213
workin' with Zac Brown, recording a record.

11:48.770 --> 11:50.506
Unbelievable.

11:52.922 --> 11:55.058
- I want to run something by you.
- Okay.

11:55.059 --> 11:56.876
Okay, Glenn and I were talking about

11:56.877 --> 11:58.298
the whole country radio issue,

11:58.299 --> 12:01.885
and Glenn came up with an idea.

12:01.886 --> 12:03.560
I don't think you're gonna like it, though.

12:03.561 --> 12:04.886
Why is that?

12:04.887 --> 12:07.335
He wants me to ask
Charlie Wentworth for help.

12:07.336 --> 12:08.667
He's in town,

12:08.668 --> 12:12.284
and, you know, we left
off on good terms, I think,

12:12.285 --> 12:15.392
and he does own half of the
radio stations in the country.

12:15.393 --> 12:17.544
But I know it's Charlie,
at the end of the day,

12:17.545 --> 12:19.738
and that might be really
uncomfortable for you.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.219
I think it's a smart idea.

12:22.177 --> 12:23.634
- You do?
- Yeah.

12:23.635 --> 12:26.170
If he can get you back on the
radio, you got to make the call.

12:26.171 --> 12:27.450
Are you... Sure?

12:27.451 --> 12:29.534
I-I don't want you to be
uncomfortable or anything.

12:29.535 --> 12:30.806
That's got to be...

12:33.281 --> 12:34.524
Make the call.

12:34.848 --> 12:35.921
Okay.

12:39.678 --> 12:41.909
This explains why he
wasn't answering his phone.

12:41.910 --> 12:43.629
There's no cell service out here.

12:58.173 --> 12:59.374
Deacon?

13:04.705 --> 13:06.175
Hey, Deacon?

13:11.090 --> 13:13.396
- What the hell, Rayna?
- What the hell?

13:14.768 --> 13:16.340
- Damn it.
- Luke: Whoa. Whoa.

13:16.341 --> 13:17.844
Take it easy, now. [Scoffs]

13:17.845 --> 13:21.428
- Why'd you do this? Why did you...
- I didn't drink, Rayna. All right?

13:21.429 --> 13:23.379
I poured it out the second
I got here, threw it in...

13:23.380 --> 13:25.365
- and just trashed the place, too, really?
- I'm redecorating.

13:25.995 --> 13:27.433
[Chuckles] I've seen you redecorate.

13:27.434 --> 13:28.480
Yeah, well, you're seeing it again.

13:28.481 --> 13:30.671
Maybe you can take your
bodyguard here and just go.

13:30.672 --> 13:32.614
Luke, can you give us a second, please?

13:35.104 --> 13:36.350
Yeah.

13:36.763 --> 13:39.113
- I'll be outside.
- Thanks.

13:43.898 --> 13:45.273
How the hell could you bring him up here?

13:45.274 --> 13:47.165
'Cause I didn't know what I
was gonna find when I got here.

13:47.166 --> 13:48.143
What are you even doing here?

13:48.144 --> 13:50.134
I have been trying to call
you for the last 24 hours.

13:50.135 --> 13:53.669
You can't just run away like
this every time things get hard!

13:53.670 --> 13:55.782
It's not even your
business, Rayna, all right?

13:55.783 --> 13:57.412
- What are you talkin' about?
- It's none of your business at all!

13:57.413 --> 13:59.052
- Did she call you?
- Who?

13:59.053 --> 13:59.997
Megan!

14:00.714 --> 14:01.787
No.

14:03.181 --> 14:04.655
Why the hell are you here?

14:04.656 --> 14:07.382
Because the entire world
knows about our daughter.

14:16.893 --> 14:18.553
Maddie Claybourne, huh?

14:18.554 --> 14:20.138
Yeah, she was mad at Teddy,

14:20.899 --> 14:22.354
didn't think it through.

14:25.602 --> 14:26.874
[Sighs]

14:28.538 --> 14:29.921
What do you want me to do?

14:29.922 --> 14:31.689
I think we're gonna have
to confront it head on.

14:32.250 --> 14:34.305
And that means all three of us.

14:34.306 --> 14:35.721
Now, you, me, and Teddy?

14:35.722 --> 14:37.273
- Yeah.
- One big, happy family?

14:37.274 --> 14:38.921
- Yeah.
- No.

14:38.922 --> 14:40.215
You're not listening to me.

14:40.216 --> 14:43.103
Your front lawn right now
is teeming with reporters.

14:43.104 --> 14:44.735
My girls can't even go to school.

14:44.736 --> 14:45.976
That's not okay with me.

14:45.977 --> 14:47.896
So we have got to control this conversation

14:47.897 --> 14:49.272
and put this to an end.

14:49.273 --> 14:51.543
All right, I understand that,
but I cannot do that, okay?

14:51.544 --> 14:52.695
Why not?

14:52.696 --> 14:54.799
I tell you what. You ask
good old Teddy, all right?

14:54.800 --> 14:57.095
- The hero.
- The pillar of society. Come on, now.

14:57.096 --> 14:59.627
Listen, I know it's not
easy for either one of you

14:59.628 --> 15:00.819
dealing with all this with Maddie,

15:00.820 --> 15:03.116
but y-you... you have got
to think about her right now.

15:03.117 --> 15:04.556
I do think about her. Okay, Rayna?

15:04.557 --> 15:06.764
I think about her all the
time, every single day,

15:06.765 --> 15:08.731
and there is nothing
I would not do for her,

15:08.732 --> 15:10.451
but I can't be with him in a room

15:10.452 --> 15:11.860
'cause if I am, I'm gonna kill him

15:12.244 --> 15:13.739
right in front of her
and in front of everybody!

15:13.740 --> 15:15.452
That's not gonna help no one!

15:16.988 --> 15:18.324
Why?

15:19.924 --> 15:21.525
You ask him.

15:23.764 --> 15:26.011
I hate the way she acts
like everything's fine.

15:26.012 --> 15:28.155
Like, in front of people,
we're best friends.

15:28.156 --> 15:29.499
What do you want her to do?

15:29.500 --> 15:32.075
Acknowledge something. Apologize.

15:32.076 --> 15:33.811
I know this is so stupid. I'm grown.

15:33.812 --> 15:37.004
I should just get over it,
but it... I can't help it.

15:37.005 --> 15:39.307
Every second I spend
with her feels like a lie,

15:39.308 --> 15:41.531
and I don't like pretending that it's not.

15:41.532 --> 15:43.204
Then why do you do it?

15:44.461 --> 15:47.587
Look, Scarlett, I've heard you
call your mom dozens of times,

15:47.588 --> 15:49.820
give her updates, say, "I love you."

15:50.148 --> 15:51.228
Yeah.

15:51.229 --> 15:54.084
Never really talk about
anything of substance with her.

15:54.085 --> 15:55.588
It's just a habit.

15:56.389 --> 15:58.244
And of course I love her. She's my mama.

15:58.772 --> 16:01.011
Doesn't give her the right
to treat you like she does.

16:01.012 --> 16:03.436
No, but we both know how she grew up.

16:03.932 --> 16:05.452
She can't help the way she is.

16:06.877 --> 16:08.404
Gunnar, this is crazy.

16:08.405 --> 16:10.683
<i>No, it is not. It is perfectly rational.</i>

16:10.684 --> 16:12.075
<i>You need a professional demo.</i>

16:12.076 --> 16:14.036
I should've just let
you get the motorcycle.

16:14.789 --> 16:15.875
<i>You ready?</i>

16:15.876 --> 16:17.364
Ready.

moved on, haven't you?

Don't hold that against me.

18:53.038 --> 18:54.509

to your concert tomorrow

18:56.757 --> 18:58.964

to promote the hell out of it.

Thank you. I really appreciate it.

learn to keep it in your pants

that'd be really great.

19:16.315 --> 19:17.601

19:17.602 --> 19:19.674
I don't really care, because
all hell is breaking loose,

19:19.675 --> 19:20.898
and I guess the last person in the world

19:20.899 --> 19:23.756

Deacon, after your shenanigans!

19:23.757 --> 19:26.379
It wasn't just me, okay? I
didn't force myself on Megan.

19:26.380 --> 19:28.539
- Ugh. Please.
- We were friends who got closer,

19:28.540 --> 19:31.316
and she was there for
me when nobody else was.

19:31.317 --> 19:34.121

Or is that why you did it?

19:34.122 --> 19:35.657

- Shh!

19:40.563 --> 19:41.611
I'm Maddie's father!

19:41.612 --> 19:42.923
I'm the one who's been there for her,

19:42.924 --> 19:45.740
and there's no way in hell that
I am just gonna step aside here!

19:45.741 --> 19:47.588

- Yes, you have.

19:47.589 --> 19:49.812

19:49.813 --> 19:51.964

19:57.100 --> 19:58.627
Let me tell you something right now.

20:21.080 --> 20:23.350

And you didn't tell me.

20:24.087 --> 20:25.422
Say something.

20:26.151 --> 20:27.926
It wasn't my secret to tell.

Betrayed by my own daughter,

20:31.278 --> 20:34.637

20:34.638 --> 20:35.509
Mama.

20:35.510 --> 20:36.493
I mean, Deacon's one thing

20:36.494 --> 20:39.685
because Rayna's always had him
wrapped around her little finger,

20:39.686 --> 20:41.221
- but you...
- I'm sorry.

20:41.222 --> 20:43.659
What? Are you and Deacon
just thick as thieves now?

20:43.660 --> 20:44.427
Is that it?

20:44.428 --> 20:46.099
Did it ever occur to either one of you

20:46.100 --> 20:48.267
that I might want to
know that I had a niece,

20:48.268 --> 20:50.307
or am I just not part
of this family anymore?

20:50.308 --> 20:53.883
Maybe I just don't rate because
I'm not on some big, fancy tour!

20:53.884 --> 20:54.980
- Is that it?!
- It's not like that at all.

20:54.981 --> 20:56.269
No! Get off of me! Please, don't hurt me.

much on the horizon at the moment.

22:19.946 --> 22:22.073

serious about breaking in,

- Los Angeles.

30:03.683 --> 30:05.097
and see if Teddy's here yet?

30:05.098 --> 30:06.569
He should have been here a while ago.

30:06.570 --> 30:08.329
- Absolutely. Yeah.
- Thank you.

30:08.330 --> 30:09.458
Yeah.

30:11.242 --> 30:12.186
[Door opens]

30:12.498 --> 30:13.851
[Door closes]

30:16.242 --> 30:17.658
It's gonna be okay.

30:18.626 --> 30:19.769
It is.

30:19.770 --> 30:23.545
Robin is fair, and she's responsible.

30:23.546 --> 30:25.938
What if I had told Deacon the truth?

30:26.659 --> 30:27.793
What if I had done that

30:27.794 --> 30:30.113
and he just stopped drinking that very day?

30:30.114 --> 30:32.161
I was there. I saw what he was like.

30:32.162 --> 30:34.073
Maybe becoming a father
would have been the thing

30:34.074 --> 30:35.921
that finally got rid of his demons.

30:35.922 --> 30:37.874
I don't think that's how addiction works.

30:37.875 --> 30:40.267
You wanted to make a
better life for Maddie.

30:40.268 --> 30:42.011
Yeah, but what's a better life, really?

30:42.012 --> 30:45.027
I mean, I'm divorced from Teddy.

30:45.028 --> 30:47.803
He's become somebody
I don't even recognize.

30:47.804 --> 30:49.756
Maddie's life has blown up.

30:49.757 --> 30:51.563
Our family's crazy. [Chuckles lightly]

30:51.564 --> 30:53.420
What's so special about this life?

30:53.724 --> 30:55.019
Really? Los Angeles?

30:55.020 --> 30:56.651
Zoey: Relax. I'm not moving there.

30:56.652 --> 30:59.011
I'm just... Thinking about
taking a couple weeks off

30:59.012 --> 31:00.707
to explore the possibilities,

31:00.708 --> 31:03.091
maybe meet with a couple
of Jackie's connections,

31:03.092 --> 31:04.948
and pick up an audition or two.

31:04.949 --> 31:07.100
You haven't even given
Nashville a shot yet.

31:07.484 --> 31:09.963
I mean, you only just got
your audition stuff together.

31:09.964 --> 31:12.315
Why don't you chill, see
what happens here first?

31:12.316 --> 31:13.283
I don't know.

31:13.284 --> 31:15.611
Jackie seems to think I
should be more proactive.

31:15.612 --> 31:17.675
Be more proactive here. Quit your job.

31:17.676 --> 31:18.939
Let music be your main focus.

31:18.940 --> 31:21.172
Are you crazy? How am I gonna pay my rent?

31:21.173 --> 31:24.379
You can move in here.
I'll take care of you.

31:24.380 --> 31:26.051
- Gunnar.
- You saw the check.

31:26.052 --> 31:27.587
There's more where that came from.

31:27.588 --> 31:29.532
And that is enough for both of us, okay?

31:30.420 --> 31:33.914
That is an incredibly generous offer,

31:34.218 --> 31:35.737
but listen to yourself.

31:35.738 --> 31:37.986
I don't... Need a sugar daddy.

31:39.682 --> 31:42.042
You know, it doesn't sound so
nice when you say it like that.

31:42.618 --> 31:43.746
I'm sorry.

31:44.731 --> 31:47.297
I really am grateful that
you would do that for me.

31:47.298 --> 31:51.178
I just... I left home to
stand on my own two feet,

31:51.610 --> 31:53.242
see what I'm capable of.

31:53.970 --> 31:57.409
Moving in would feel like
a step backward, you know?

31:57.410 --> 31:59.969
I just want to help you
make your dreams come true.

31:59.970 --> 32:01.738
But what about your dreams?

32:02.226 --> 32:03.993
<i>What about what you want?</i>

32:03.994 --> 32:06.218
That's what you should
be spending your money on.

32:09.658 --> 32:12.274
- What are you doing here?
- I'm a guest of Juliette's.

32:12.275 --> 32:13.750
She said you were sending programmers.

32:13.751 --> 32:15.494
Didn't mention anything
about you coming by.

32:15.495 --> 32:16.919
Yeah, I suddenly got nostalgic

32:16.920 --> 32:19.582
about being backstage at
a Juliette Barnes concert.

32:20.351 --> 32:22.261
It's intoxicating, really.

32:22.262 --> 32:23.558
Just couldn't keep away.

32:24.391 --> 32:26.622
Hey, just to be clear.

32:27.600 --> 32:29.318
I don't like the way you treated her.

32:29.319 --> 32:31.086
- Oh.
- She deserved better.

32:31.087 --> 32:32.631
- Mm-hmm.
- She still does.

32:32.967 --> 32:34.383
And I suppose that's you, is it?

32:34.384 --> 32:35.990
She certainly seems to think so.

32:36.751 --> 32:38.961
Look, mate, um [Clears throat]

32:38.962 --> 32:40.466
You're out of your league.

32:41.066 --> 32:42.938
Sooner or later, she's gonna realize that.

32:43.282 --> 32:46.106
It's always about money and
power with you, isn't it?

32:46.812 --> 32:48.498
Would've thought you'd learn by now.

32:48.818 --> 32:50.411
You can't buy Juliette.

32:50.842 --> 32:52.346
- Hm.
- You never could.

32:52.674 --> 32:53.930
It's over, Charlie.

32:55.379 --> 32:56.770
Move on.

32:59.576 --> 33:00.791
[Knock on door]

33:00.792 --> 33:02.040
Juliette: Come in.

33:02.816 --> 33:04.424
- Hey.
- Hey.

33:05.168 --> 33:06.352
Um...

33:07.856 --> 33:09.335
Can I talk to you a minute?

33:09.336 --> 33:10.568
Yeah.

33:11.361 --> 33:13.008
I feel really stupid asking,

33:13.009 --> 33:14.422
and I know I shouldn't,

33:15.393 --> 33:17.512
but I-I was wondering if I...

33:18.195 --> 33:19.968
If could have tonight off.

33:20.393 --> 33:22.776
Uh, this isn't Dairy Queen,

33:22.777 --> 33:26.111
where you can just switch
shifts with somebody, Scarlett.

33:26.112 --> 33:28.872
You're... It. You're my opening act.

33:28.873 --> 33:30.768
I kn... I know, and I shouldn't be asking.

33:30.769 --> 33:35.153
I know. I-I can't believe
I am, but I... I'm asking.

33:35.601 --> 33:37.808
Please don't make me go out there tonight.

33:37.809 --> 33:39.424
Is this about your mama?

33:40.031 --> 33:41.711
Girl, if there is anybody

33:41.712 --> 33:44.256
who understands what you're
going through, it's me.

33:44.257 --> 33:45.816
But you got to figure out a way

33:45.817 --> 33:48.312
to get up there on that stage and smile,

33:48.313 --> 33:50.703
- even when you feel like crying.
- I know.

33:51.326 --> 33:52.743
Okay?

33:52.744 --> 33:55.239
Good. There's a lot of
important radio people out there,

33:55.240 --> 33:57.504
so I need you to give them a good show.

33:57.505 --> 33:58.832
I will.

34:04.304 --> 34:05.648
[Door slams]

34:06.424 --> 34:07.912
[Sobbing]

34:09.623 --> 34:10.920
[Sniffling]

34:27.312 --> 34:28.235
Robin, you ready?

34:28.235 --> 34:29.554
<i>- Robin: All set here.
- Okay.</i>

34:29.556 --> 34:31.266
- Rayna, Teddy, you guys ready?
- Yeah.

34:31.268 --> 34:32.808
Rayna: Yeah. I'll give
you a 10-second lead-in.

34:33.657 --> 34:36.013
Excuse me. Y'all got another chair?

34:37.254 --> 34:38.204
Um...

34:38.205 --> 34:41.045
Uh... Can you give us
one quick second, please?

34:41.045 --> 34:43.126
- Man: Sure. Get a chair.
- Hey.

34:45.014 --> 34:46.348
I didn't think you were coming.

34:46.349 --> 34:48.108
I'm here. What do you want me to say?

34:48.636 --> 34:50.971
Well, I want you to tell the truth.

34:50.972 --> 34:52.985
- You sure about that?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

34:52.987 --> 34:53.914
That's what I'll do.

34:53.915 --> 34:55.512
Sorry, folks. New York
is on a tight schedule.

34:55.513 --> 34:57.288
- Can we go?
- Let's do it.

34:57.289 --> 34:58.665
Okay, let's do it.

35:03.570 --> 35:08.848
And 10, 9, 8, 7, 6...

35:08.849 --> 35:11.825
5, 4, 3...

35:19.740 --> 35:21.947
<i>Robin: Rayna, Deacon, mayor Conrad,</i>

35:21.948 --> 35:23.892
<i>thanks so much for
agreeing to speak with us.</i>

35:23.893 --> 35:25.460
- Thank you, Robin.
- Rayna: Thank you for having us.

35:25.461 --> 35:27.567
<i>Now, Rayna, it's widely known</i>

35:27.568 --> 35:30.408
<i>that you and Deacon did
date back in the day.</i>

35:30.409 --> 35:31.296
<i>Is that correct?</i>

35:31.297 --> 35:33.400
Yes, we did, and... and, um...

35:33.401 --> 35:37.456
Deacon has always been a very
important part of... of my life

35:37.457 --> 35:40.056
and our lives, both
personally and professionally.

35:40.057 --> 35:42.503
And, uh, today, we're
really here to clarify...

35:42.504 --> 35:43.215
I'm sorry, Robin.

35:43.216 --> 35:45.760
Why don't we just...
Get right down to this?

35:45.761 --> 35:48.017
Uh, yes, I am the biological father

35:48.433 --> 35:50.072
of Rayna's oldest daughter.

35:50.073 --> 35:52.241
So, why was she raised by another man?

35:54.313 --> 35:56.207
It's because I'm an alcoholic.

35:56.208 --> 35:58.599
Uh, that's actually probably
too nice a word for it.

35:58.600 --> 36:00.456
Back then, I was just a plain, old drunk.

36:00.457 --> 36:02.800
Rayna tried more times
than I care to admit...

36:02.801 --> 36:04.840
she tried to get me into
rehab, get me fixed up,

36:04.841 --> 36:07.617
but, uh... I just wasn't
ready to be a father.

36:07.929 --> 36:11.328
<i>So, Rayna, when you found
out you were pregnant...</i>

36:11.329 --> 36:13.159
Deacon and I were no longer together,

36:13.160 --> 36:14.711
and I was dating Teddy

36:14.712 --> 36:16.840
and I told Teddy about the baby right away.

36:16.841 --> 36:18.488
We were always very honest about that.

36:18.489 --> 36:19.472
Teddy: That's true, Robin.

36:19.473 --> 36:21.336
I-I did know about the baby
right from the beginning,

36:21.337 --> 36:24.424
and while I may not be
Maddie's biological father,

36:24.425 --> 36:27.367
I can promise you that
I... I fell in love with her

36:27.368 --> 36:30.343
from the moment I held her
in my arms for the first time.

36:30.344 --> 36:31.736
<i>And what about you, Deacon?</i>

36:32.193 --> 36:33.865
<i>Do you have a relationship with Maddie?</i>

36:34.265 --> 36:36.201
Yes, uh, I do.

36:37.161 --> 36:39.208
It's the single best part of my life.

36:39.209 --> 36:41.856
She is an exceptional young lady,

36:41.857 --> 36:45.495
and Rayna, here, along with mayor Conrad...

36:45.496 --> 36:47.487
well, they done an
amazing job raising her up.

36:47.488 --> 36:49.616
<i>Well, you clearly aren't the only one</i>

36:49.617 --> 36:51.336
<i>who thinks Maddie is exceptional.</i>

36:51.337 --> 36:54.776
<i>Her video now has over 900,000 hits.</i>

36:54.777 --> 36:57.160
<i>People are saying she's
the next Taylor Swift!</i>

36:57.161 --> 36:58.080
Oh. [Chuckles]

36:58.081 --> 37:00.704
<i>So can we expect a debut
album any time soon?</i>

37:00.705 --> 37:02.913
- Uh... No, ma'am.
- [Chuckling] Oh, no.

37:22.852 --> 37:25.195
<i>Again, thanks so much for being here.</i>

37:25.196 --> 37:27.003
- Thanks, Robin.
- Man: And we're out.

37:27.004 --> 37:28.787
Robin, thank you. We appreciate it.

37:28.788 --> 37:30.828
<i>Robin: Oh, any time,
Rayna. You take care, now.</i>

37:31.676 --> 37:32.860
You too.

37:36.243 --> 37:37.515
Tandy: I think that went perfectly.

37:37.516 --> 37:38.691
- You do?
- Yeah.

37:38.692 --> 37:40.835
Yep. Yeah. It totally diffused the story.

37:40.836 --> 37:43.120
Good. I hope you're right.

37:44.624 --> 37:45.583
You know what?

37:45.584 --> 37:48.510
I'm gonna go on home and let
y'all have some family time.

37:48.511 --> 37:49.936
- All right. Thanks, babe.
- Yep.

37:50.440 --> 37:51.784
Call me later.

37:53.640 --> 37:55.264
[Reporters shouting indistinctly]

37:55.624 --> 37:57.296
Are you gonna be dad number three?

37:58.176 --> 38:00.000
[Shouting continues]

38:05.505 --> 38:06.944
Damn it!

38:09.160 --> 38:11.368
- Take me to the airport.
- Yes, sir.

38:13.176 --> 38:14.463
Hey.

38:14.464 --> 38:16.008
Where were you all day, huh?

38:16.352 --> 38:19.307
[Slurred] I smell the flowers
in my room all the way out here.

38:19.308 --> 38:20.868
[Chuckles lightly] You been drinking?

38:21.244 --> 38:22.755
No. Go away.

38:22.756 --> 38:24.547
- Wait, Scarlett, hold on.
- Get off me!

38:25.316 --> 38:26.620
You stay away from me.

38:27.820 --> 38:29.515
Hey, go get Juliette right away.

38:29.516 --> 38:30.820
Tell her it's an emergency.

38:33.046 --> 38:34.334
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:34.862 --> 38:36.238
I wanted to say thank you

38:36.662 --> 38:38.054
for doing that.

38:38.574 --> 38:40.838
- You ran out of there so fast.
- Yeah.

38:41.566 --> 38:42.726
You were right.

38:44.198 --> 38:45.638
We needed to do it.

38:46.534 --> 38:47.670
How's she doing?

38:48.510 --> 38:49.774
I don't know.

38:50.910 --> 38:52.046
[Sighs]

38:53.366 --> 38:54.814
You should've told me, Ray.

38:56.698 --> 38:58.500
I'm sorry. Look, I was...

38:58.884 --> 39:01.091
A mess when you found
out you were pregnant.

39:01.092 --> 39:02.451
I get that.

39:02.452 --> 39:05.244
But I got better, and...

39:07.412 --> 39:10.371
I've been good a long time, right?

39:13.364 --> 39:18.035
So why didn't you tell me when
she was like... 3, you know?

39:18.036 --> 39:19.708
Or 5 or 10 or...

39:22.140 --> 39:23.371
Why didn't you just give me

39:23.875 --> 39:25.643
a little more time to be her daddy?

39:27.453 --> 39:29.463
You were always a part
of her life, you know?

39:29.464 --> 39:30.959
- I mean, I made sure of that.
- Oh, no, Ray... no.

39:30.960 --> 39:32.336
You got to watch her grow up.

39:33.600 --> 39:35.046
It's not the same.

39:35.047 --> 39:36.723
You know that's not the same, Rayna.

39:37.307 --> 39:38.579
You ever sing her to sleep?

39:38.915 --> 39:40.179
Mm-hmm.

39:40.180 --> 39:41.443
I never did.

39:41.444 --> 39:44.235
And I never got to hold
her when she was scared,

39:44.236 --> 39:47.507
or, uh... I don't know...
feel her clinging to my leg

39:47.508 --> 39:49.587
when she was shy around a stranger.

39:49.588 --> 39:51.827
Yeah, I was there all the time, but...

39:54.067 --> 39:56.579
I didn't know, you know? God, help me.

39:56.580 --> 39:58.883
The hard part is, is that right
now, I still wouldn't know.

39:58.884 --> 40:00.803
If she hadn't found out,
Rayna, I still wouldn't know.

40:00.804 --> 40:02.011
You'd be sitting right in that chair

40:02.012 --> 40:04.587
lying to my face right now and
every other day the rest of my life.

40:04.588 --> 40:06.395
You don't know that. I mean... [Sighs]

40:07.988 --> 40:09.250
Look, I'm sorry.

40:09.251 --> 40:11.787
I went there, and I did what
I needed to do for my daughter,

40:11.788 --> 40:14.148
but that's all I got
for you right now, Rayna.

40:15.044 --> 40:18.499
<i>Our daughter. She's our daughter, Deacon.</i>

40:18.500 --> 40:20.995
And I've done what I
had to do for her, too.

40:20.996 --> 40:22.930
You think I wanted it like this?

40:22.931 --> 40:24.795
I wanted to be your wife.

40:25.331 --> 40:28.099
I wanted us to raise her up together

40:28.100 --> 40:30.044
in a wonderful, loving home

40:30.364 --> 40:32.772
that you could not provide.

40:36.052 --> 40:38.402
I cried myself to sleep
about that for a year,

40:38.403 --> 40:40.234
I wanted it so bad.

40:40.235 --> 40:41.378
And, you know, you're right,

40:41.379 --> 40:42.643
I could have told you

40:42.644 --> 40:44.883
at some point down the
line, I guess, but when?

40:44.884 --> 40:46.307
You know, when, really, is a good time

40:46.308 --> 40:49.235
to blow up your kid's life?

40:49.236 --> 40:50.603
And when you did find out,

40:50.604 --> 40:52.147
did you just scoop her up in your arms

40:52.148 --> 40:53.258
and tell her how much you loved her

40:53.259 --> 40:55.082
and you were so proud of her?

40:55.083 --> 40:56.491
No.

40:58.452 --> 41:00.427
You got drunk.

41:00.428 --> 41:02.324
You got drunk, and I almost died.

41:03.364 --> 41:05.035
I lied to you. I did.

41:05.036 --> 41:07.163
And I bet you resent the
hell out of me for that,

41:07.164 --> 41:09.210
but I guarantee you, I resent you even more

41:09.211 --> 41:11.795
for putting us in this
position in the first place.

41:15.124 --> 41:17.547
Oh, I love your boots.
Where'd you get those from?

41:17.548 --> 41:18.707
Around here?

41:18.708 --> 41:20.619
Hey, back off! Excuse me?

41:20.620 --> 41:21.936
Scarlett, you need to come
with me right now. Come on.

41:21.937 --> 41:22.920
No, I've got to go do the show.

41:22.921 --> 41:24.376
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Leave her alone, mate.

41:24.377 --> 41:25.648
<i>You leave her alone!</i>

41:25.649 --> 41:26.672
Scarlett's off-limits!

41:26.673 --> 41:28.349
Oh, really? You laying claim
to that one, too, are you?

41:28.350 --> 41:29.685
Is there anyone here you're not dating?

41:29.686 --> 41:31.053
What the hell's going on? [Crowd cheering]

41:31.054 --> 41:32.725
I don't know. Better ask your boyfriend.

41:32.726 --> 41:33.821
Emcee: Ladies and gentlemen,

41:33.822 --> 41:36.406
put your hands together
for miss Scarlett O'Connor!

41:36.407 --> 41:37.439
Scarlett!

41:38.097 --> 41:39.815
Y'all ready to have some fun?!

41:40.295 --> 41:41.462
What was that?

41:42.030 --> 41:43.734
I don't know. Something's wrong.

41:44.056 --> 41:45.461
I'm not talking about Scarlett.

41:45.462 --> 41:48.237
Wha... it's okay for Charlie to kiss me,

41:48.238 --> 41:49.797
but you won't let him anywhere
near your ex-girlfriend?

41:49.798 --> 41:52.191
<i>Wait. You said he tried to kiss you.</i>

41:52.895 --> 41:54.246
You look so beautiful!

41:54.247 --> 41:56.526
Thank you so much for coming to see me.

41:56.974 --> 41:58.805
<i>Beverly: [Echoing] It should
be me up on that stage!</i>

41:58.806 --> 41:59.693
<i>I should be up there!</i>

42:00.509 --> 42:02.405
[Music plays]

42:04.149 --> 42:06.212
<i>All of this is because of me.</i>

42:06.213 --> 42:08.532
<i>Your talent is my talent!</i>

42:08.533 --> 42:10.420
<i>Think you're such a tragedy?</i>

42:10.421 --> 42:13.469
<i>Your childhood was a
picnic compared to mine.</i>

42:13.797 --> 42:15.597
[Music stops]

42:19.533 --> 42:20.852
[Audience murmuring]

42:20.853 --> 42:22.156
Scarlett: I'm sorry.

42:22.157 --> 42:23.787
[Crying] Please don't do that.

42:23.788 --> 42:26.036
Why are you doing this to me?

42:26.037 --> 42:27.420
What did I do to you?

42:27.421 --> 42:28.941
You make me so angry.

42:29.429 --> 42:31.157
[Shouting indistinctly]

42:35.813 --> 42:38.349
Aah! No, no, no, no, no!

42:38.757 --> 42:41.524
Please stop. Please stop.

42:41.525 --> 42:43.629
- Please stop. No.
- Scarlett.

42:43.949 --> 42:46.198
Oh, my God.
