'Twas the night before Christmas,
and all through the house,

00:18.818 --> 00:24.358
not a creature was stirring,
not even a mouse.

02:05.591 --> 02:08.047
Goddamn, Day-Day.

02:09.595 --> 02:13.842
Take it all.
One, two, get up, three.

02:13.933 --> 02:16.804
That's what I'm talkin' about.

02:28.239 --> 02:32.817
Damn! That's an ugly-ass baby.
Eyes cocked like a pistol.

02:32.910 --> 02:37.288
All I want, Santa Claus,
is two fat bitches and a bag of weed

02:37.373 --> 02:40.707
and two bags of chips
to give to the fat bitches.

02:42.378 --> 02:43.541
What the...

02:43.629 --> 02:45.622
Damn, these niggas are broke.

02:45.715 --> 02:49.582
No Christmas ham in here. Nothing.

02:49.677 --> 02:51.420
lt's a damn shame.

02:51.512 --> 02:53.920
All l want is two fat bitches
and some cheeseburgers

02:54.015 --> 02:55.806
so Cheeco can lick on them

02:55.892 --> 02:58.015
and two years' supply
of rolling paper.

02:58.102 --> 03:00.723
Two pieces of bologna. Yeah, baby.

03:00.813 --> 03:04.147
This gonna be good right here.
I'm so hungry.

03:05.860 --> 03:07.734
What the hell
you doin' in my house

03:07.820 --> 03:09.528
eatin' a big-ass sandwich and shit?

03:09.614 --> 03:12.021
Nigga, I'm Santa Claus.
Where's the milk and cookies?

03:12.116 --> 03:13.694
Santa Claus!

03:13.784 --> 03:14.983
Shit!

03:15.077 --> 03:17.319
You better get your ass outta here!

03:17.413 --> 03:18.528
Goddamn!

03:18.623 --> 03:20.283
Day-Day! Day-Day!

03:38.726 --> 03:42.225
All I want is a fat bitch with
a name belt that say ''Glitter'' on it.

03:46.526 --> 03:48.767
Day-Day! Help me, man!

03:58.704 --> 04:00.448
Merry Christmas, motherfucker!

04:13.261 --> 04:14.719
As you can see.

04:14.804 --> 04:17.341
I got my black ass
back in the ghetto.

04:17.430 --> 04:19.803
the only place
where you can get robbed

04:19.892 --> 04:22.051
by Santa Claus
on Chistmas Eve.

04:22.144 --> 04:23.259
Shit!

04:23.354 --> 04:26.688
I don't know if I can handle
another goddamn Friday.

04:26.774 --> 04:28.149
This shit hurt.

04:29.277 --> 04:32.396
Day-Day! Wake up, man!
We just got robbed!

04:33.447 --> 04:35.938
Get your scary ass up, man!
I know you heard that shit!

04:37.326 --> 04:38.571
Get out of here, man!

04:39.370 --> 04:41.244
Wake your ass up!

04:41.330 --> 04:43.157
Come on, man,
I gotta call the po-po!

04:45.126 --> 04:48.043
What you say? Damn.

04:49.088 --> 04:50.547
We just got robbed, Cheeco.

08:01.989 --> 08:06.069
Unit 415. man
in the middle of the street.

08:06.160 --> 08:08.153
Then what happened?

08:08.246 --> 08:11.282
Then I caught him.
I hit him, like, four times.

08:11.374 --> 08:14.375
I would've been a boxer,
but I was in Special Education.

08:14.460 --> 08:16.832
I'm telling you,
I was whooping his ass!

08:16.921 --> 08:18.914
Craig got to fightin' with him,
he beat his ass.

08:19.006 --> 08:20.666
- Go check out the bedrooms.
- Sure.

08:20.758 --> 08:22.466
What else did he get?

08:23.386 --> 08:26.055
Like I said,
he took all of our presents,

08:26.138 --> 08:28.131
he took my CD collection,

08:28.224 --> 08:31.557
he even took
Day-Day's baby pictures.

08:31.644 --> 08:34.727
And he got our speaker
with all our rent money in it.

08:34.813 --> 08:35.845
Rent money!

08:37.732 --> 08:39.643
- Sit your ass down!
- Who got the rent money?!

08:39.735 --> 08:42.486
You ain't about to do nothin'.

08:42.572 --> 08:44.114
Jumpin' up like you Mr. Get Bad.

08:44.198 --> 08:46.772
Where was you when he was
beatin' my ass with that tree?

08:46.867 --> 08:49.537
- Craig, my leg is hurtin', man.
- Good!

08:49.620 --> 08:52.657
Yeah, he got
the rent money. All of it.

08:52.748 --> 08:55.286
You're positive he was dressed
like Santa Claus?

08:55.376 --> 08:57.582
Jolly white fat guy,
little red suit,

08:57.670 --> 09:00.505
couple elves packin' the bags.

09:00.590 --> 09:02.132
He's a project Santa Claus.

09:02.216 --> 09:04.886
Picture Ol' Dirty Bastard
in a Santa Claus suit.

09:04.969 --> 09:06.546
Can you picture that?

09:06.637 --> 09:09.307
Do you know who
Ol' Dirty Bastard is?

09:09.390 --> 09:11.347
I'm not big on that.

09:11.434 --> 09:13.391
You oughta be nervous.
You a black cop.

09:13.477 --> 09:16.147
You two motherfuckers huddle up
or something and find this dude.

09:16.230 --> 09:17.772
Stay right there.

09:18.232 --> 09:19.347
I ain't goin' nowhere.

09:19.442 --> 09:21.019
- Calm down.
- I'm calm.

09:21.110 --> 09:23.186
- You're gonna sit in the car.
- Do your fucking job!

09:23.279 --> 09:24.738
You're pushing the wrong buttons.

09:24.822 --> 09:26.649
We the victims, man.

09:26.741 --> 09:29.825
That victim shit is way overblown.

09:29.911 --> 09:32.033
Just sit there and shut up.

09:32.121 --> 09:33.580
Asshole.

09:33.664 --> 09:35.657
Santa Claus strikes again.

09:35.750 --> 09:38.122
Makes me want to go home
and lock up all my shit.

09:38.210 --> 09:40.250
You gotta stop talking
to the police like that.

09:40.338 --> 09:42.377
Shut up! You better stop
talking to me like that.

09:42.465 --> 09:44.920
I could kick your ass
for the way you actin' this morning.

09:45.009 --> 09:46.551
We gonna have our Christmas party?

09:46.636 --> 09:50.052
How we gonna have a party
with our apartment looking like this?

09:50.139 --> 09:53.306
We can't cancel the party, man!
What about the hos we had coming?

09:53.392 --> 09:55.052
I invited some nice-ass girls.

09:55.144 --> 09:56.425
They gonna fuck for a buck,

09:56.520 --> 09:58.430
do something strange
for a little piece of change,

09:58.523 --> 10:00.978
and I know we gonna
make them holler for a dollar.

10:01.067 --> 10:03.143
One said they was gonna
suck my dick from the back.

10:03.236 --> 10:05.524
I ain't never had that
ever happen to me.

10:05.613 --> 10:10.773
I'm trying to go see
what that be like right there--

10:10.868 --> 10:13.953
Look, man, I don't give
a shit about you, that party.

10:14.038 --> 10:15.532
All I got to worry about is the rent,

10:15.623 --> 10:18.410
and it was your idea
to use half the rent money...

10:21.587 --> 10:23.414
Dix, I think we got something here.

10:23.506 --> 10:25.629
Well, well. Whose is this?

10:25.716 --> 10:27.923
Actually, it's both of ours.

10:28.010 --> 10:29.042
No, it ain't!

10:30.012 --> 10:32.930
lt is, but it's for
medicinal uses only.

10:33.015 --> 10:35.850
I mean, he got cataract,
lazy eye, a little glaucoma.

10:35.935 --> 10:39.185
- See that eye right there?
- Little shot of gonorrhea, see?

10:39.272 --> 10:41.845
Do you guys have any idea
what we could do to you for this?

10:41.941 --> 10:44.313
- No.
- Juvenile center?

10:44.402 --> 10:47.319
We can make your Christmas
worse than it already is.

10:47.405 --> 10:48.519
Being that it's Friday,

10:48.614 --> 10:51.319
that means you're not gonna
see a judge till possibly Monday.

10:51.409 --> 10:52.488
Maybe.

10:52.577 --> 10:56.111
But, since we're nice guys,
we'll just confiscate this plant,

10:56.205 --> 10:58.779
take it with us until we find
this Santa Claus character.

10:58.875 --> 11:00.867
That's fucked up, too.

11:00.960 --> 11:03.451
Oh, hey,
and when we find St. Nick,

11:03.546 --> 11:06.215
what do y'all want us
to do to him, you know?

11:06.299 --> 11:09.917
Cracked ribs, fractured skull,
little eye gouge?

11:10.011 --> 11:12.549
Fractured skull,
beat the shit out that motherfucker.

11:12.638 --> 11:15.675
- Eye gouge, that's the shit.
- And an eye gouge.

11:15.766 --> 11:18.720
I say stick a plunger in his ass,
like they did in New York.

11:18.811 --> 11:20.887
Fractured skull.

11:20.980 --> 11:24.598
This is Officer Brian Dix.
I'm Officer Alvin Hole.

11:24.692 --> 11:26.435
We'll let you know
if anything develops.

11:26.527 --> 11:29.647
Officer A. Hole and B. Dix.

11:29.739 --> 11:31.114
We'll call you...

11:31.199 --> 11:33.440
if we find anything.

11:34.535 --> 11:36.528
I like them police right there.

11:38.915 --> 11:42.366
You got a big pile of dog shit
in the middle of your bed.

11:42.460 --> 11:44.915
You might want to check that out.

11:45.004 --> 11:46.415
Merry Christmas.

11:48.257 --> 11:49.835
He's the dick.

11:50.092 --> 11:51.800
What the hell
is going on around here?!

11:51.886 --> 11:53.380
Happy Holidays, Miss Pearly.

11:53.471 --> 11:57.682
Police running in and out!
What the hell is going on?

11:57.767 --> 12:00.721
Somebody broke in
and stole all our stuff.

12:00.811 --> 12:02.222
That bullshit security.

12:02.313 --> 12:04.851
I sure hope they
didn't get the rent money

12:04.941 --> 12:07.514
'cause you two niggas
been ducking and dodging me

12:07.610 --> 12:08.773
for about three weeks now.

12:08.861 --> 12:09.892
Me--

12:09.987 --> 12:14.530
Today is the day
you motherfuckers is gonna kick in!

12:14.617 --> 12:17.571
Why you always bring your ass
up here harassing us?

12:17.662 --> 12:19.156
With that big ol' wolf pussy?

12:19.247 --> 12:21.535
You come here all the time
smelling like that.

12:21.624 --> 12:24.293
- You don't even own the place!
- You just the manager.

12:24.377 --> 12:27.793
And I'm gonna manage
to evict your skinny-punk black ass

12:27.880 --> 12:31.415
out of here today if you two
motherfuckers don't pay up your rent.

12:31.509 --> 12:33.715
Man, get that lined up.

12:33.803 --> 12:36.376
Don't you worry about it, bitch.
I know somebody like it.

12:36.472 --> 12:40.221
Take your ass back downstairs,
'cause you ain't evictin' nobody

12:40.309 --> 12:42.432
unless you got
a motherfucking army with you.

12:42.520 --> 12:46.019
I don't need no army, Mr. Smart-Ass!

12:46.107 --> 12:48.514
My son Damon home right now.

12:48.609 --> 12:49.688
Damon!

12:49.777 --> 12:52.529
I had a nightmare
about that fool last night.

12:53.573 --> 12:55.067
Day-Day!

12:55.157 --> 12:56.735
Craig!

12:58.536 --> 13:00.991
Which one of you bitches
want to wash my drawers tonight?

13:01.080 --> 13:02.622
- That'd be him.
- Him.

13:04.292 --> 13:05.572
Okay.

13:05.668 --> 13:08.752
I wash on Sundays, anyway.

13:08.838 --> 13:10.462
Starch or press?

13:10.548 --> 13:12.042
Starch, nigga!

13:14.927 --> 13:16.090
Move!

13:16.178 --> 13:18.088
Come on in, Miss Pearly.

13:18.180 --> 13:20.754
- When did he get out?
- Last night.

13:21.225 --> 13:24.475
And I'm gonna let you two bitches
in on a little secret--

13:24.562 --> 13:28.180
when you spend 12 years
on a level-4 prison yard,

13:28.274 --> 13:32.437
you become quite fond
of little ol' girls like yourselves.

13:32.528 --> 13:35.446
So either I'm gonna
get my rent money today,

13:35.531 --> 13:38.781
or somebody getting
their salad tossed tonight!

13:38.868 --> 13:39.899
Damn!

13:39.994 --> 13:41.405
That ain't even necessary.

13:41.495 --> 13:42.527
Sure ain't!

13:42.622 --> 13:44.947
We start our new job today,

13:45.041 --> 13:47.532
and I swear to God we're gonna
have your money later on tonight--

13:47.627 --> 13:49.915
cash...in your hand!

13:50.004 --> 13:51.249
You better!

13:51.339 --> 13:56.416
Either you fixin' to come see me,
or Damon gonna come see you.

13:56.510 --> 13:58.254
Simple as that.

13:58.346 --> 14:00.422
You like 'cause your son is a fag?

14:00.514 --> 14:02.341
Shut up, bitch!

14:04.727 --> 14:08.262
Tell your fine daddy I said...

14:12.902 --> 14:14.645
I hate that bitch!

14:14.737 --> 14:17.145
Tight-ass pants, man! Shit!

14:18.407 --> 14:20.815
Look how tight
these motherfucking pants are.

14:20.910 --> 14:23.483
I can't even do
the James Brown in these pants.

14:23.579 --> 14:25.536
Good. I don't want
to see you do the James Brown.

14:25.623 --> 14:28.328
We ain't never gonna get
no pussy in these clothes.

14:28.417 --> 14:29.662
I'm gonna get some.

14:29.752 --> 14:31.709
Tasha, how we look?

14:31.796 --> 14:33.124
Like a couple of rent-a-cops.

14:33.214 --> 14:35.171
What about them rent-a-tits?

14:36.676 --> 14:38.834
See, the clothes don't make the player,

14:38.928 --> 14:40.755
the player make the clothes.

14:40.846 --> 14:42.389
Rent-a-cops get pussy, too.

14:42.473 --> 14:44.382
I'm not no rent-a-cop,
I'm a Top Flight Security

14:44.475 --> 14:46.468
and don't you never forget it.

14:46.561 --> 14:49.230
I swear, the first motherfucker
get out of hand...

14:49.313 --> 14:51.389
- I'm gonna beat the--
- Shit!

14:51.482 --> 14:53.107
Craig and Day-Day.

14:55.945 --> 14:58.234
Just the niggas I need to see.

14:58.322 --> 15:00.315
Yo, what's up, O.G., triple O.G.,

15:00.408 --> 15:03.444
O.G. triple, triple...O.G.?

15:03.536 --> 15:04.947
You got out last night?

15:05.037 --> 15:07.244
I ain't seen y'all
in about 12 years, nigga.

15:07.331 --> 15:09.039
I was little. I was about--

15:09.125 --> 15:10.323
You're grown up now, though.

15:12.003 --> 15:13.995
Give a nigga a hug, dawg.

15:16.299 --> 15:17.709
I'm about to go--

15:20.428 --> 15:22.716
lt's cool, dawg, it's cool. Come here.

15:23.306 --> 15:24.504
Yeah, right there.

15:25.933 --> 15:28.471
- Group hug, nigga.
- Come on, Craig.

15:29.687 --> 15:30.802
All right, come here.

15:30.897 --> 15:33.222
Get your ass over here.
Talk to you for a minute.

15:33.316 --> 15:35.059
What's up, dawg?

15:35.151 --> 15:36.728
lt's good to be home,

15:36.819 --> 15:39.986
'cause in the prison, dawg,
ain't nothin' but the fellas, nigga.

15:40.072 --> 15:42.361
- That's what I heard.
- I swear, man.

15:42.450 --> 15:44.822
We got to care about each other.

15:44.911 --> 15:46.239
That's right.

15:49.749 --> 15:51.243
Somebody go get my mother!

15:51.375 --> 15:54.661
I heard you motherfuckers
ain't paid your rent this month.

15:54.754 --> 15:56.746
Ducking and dodging
my moms and shit!

15:57.548 --> 15:59.208
Get your tittie off my chin!

16:00.426 --> 16:02.751
Show up here tonight
without that rent money,

16:02.845 --> 16:05.846
and we gonna get
real motherfucking acquainted.

16:05.932 --> 16:07.011
You dig?

16:07.099 --> 16:10.551
- I can't breathe, I swear to God!
- He can't breathe!

16:10.645 --> 16:11.724
Do you dig?!

16:11.812 --> 16:13.686
I'm feeling you, dawg. Trust me.

16:13.773 --> 16:16.098
- Digging it.
- Good, good.

16:16.192 --> 16:18.517
'Cause I'm gonna
only say this shit once.

16:19.654 --> 16:21.029
Come on, man, let's go.

16:22.073 --> 16:24.860
Y'all look good in your little
tight-ass rent-a-cop outfits.

16:24.951 --> 16:27.239
Merry Christmas, niggettes.

16:28.704 --> 16:31.160
Shit, man! That's bullshit, man.

16:31.249 --> 16:34.084
He's gonna try and do
something strange to us!

16:34.168 --> 16:35.912
I'm gonna think of something.

16:36.003 --> 16:37.414
That's fucked up, man.

16:37.505 --> 16:40.174
He might do something strange
to you, though.

16:47.056 --> 16:48.930
Puff-puff and give, motherfucker.

16:49.016 --> 16:51.803
This is good shit.
I ain't gonna be your mother--

16:51.894 --> 16:53.851
- Damn!
- Hurry up!

17:05.199 --> 17:08.366
About a yean ago.
my Pops quit his dog-catching job

17:08.452 --> 17:11.369
and went into business
with my Uncle Elroy.

17:11.454 --> 17:14.290
They opened up a spot
called Bros. Barb-B-Q.

17:14.375 --> 17:17.329
''Tastes so good.
make you wanna slap youn mama. ''

17:17.420 --> 17:19.292
You might've
seen the commencial.

17:19.380 --> 17:21.953
Y'all tired of that barbecue
from up the street.

17:22.049 --> 17:23.876

more sauce than meat?

17:23.968 --> 17:26.044
Bning youn big ass down

17:26.137 --> 17:28.842

17:28.931 --> 17:30.425
That's right off Manciesten.

17:30.516 --> 17:34.181
Bros. Bar-B-Q. Tastes so good.

17:34.270 --> 17:35.349
Don't it. Willie?

17:35.438 --> 17:37.430
Yeah. boy. Hey. Mama.

17:37.523 --> 17:38.934
What the hell you want?

17:41.027 --> 17:43.814
Ain't but one location.
so it's nearest you.

17:43.905 --> 17:45.363
You might've missed it.

17:45.448 --> 17:47.939
They only had enough money
for a 15-second spot.

17:48.034 --> 17:50.192
But. anyway. my Pops
got me and Day-Day

17:50.286 --> 17:53.073
thesejobs
at the same strip mall

17:53.164 --> 17:54.907
as Christmas-help security.

17:54.999 --> 17:59.328
Look, Day-Day,
we only security guards, okay?

17:59.420 --> 18:01.413
Ghetto security guards at that.

18:01.505 --> 18:04.341
We ain't Cops.
we ain't America's Most Wanted.

18:04.425 --> 18:07.545
NYPD Blue.
none of that shit you watch.

18:07.637 --> 18:09.344
We something like them.

18:09.430 --> 18:10.675
No. Nothing like it.

18:10.765 --> 18:13.885
All we gonna do--take it easy,
make this money,

18:13.976 --> 18:15.636
you're gonna watch your temper--

18:15.728 --> 18:16.843
I ain't got to watch shit!

18:16.937 --> 18:19.060
You gonna treat people right,
talk to people right.

18:19.148 --> 18:21.437
You can get your ass kicked
around here real quick.

18:21.526 --> 18:23.399
I don't care about it
getting out of hand.

18:23.486 --> 18:25.562
I ain't getting into shit
because of you.

18:25.655 --> 18:28.359
This is a job, man.
This ain't an adventure.

18:28.449 --> 18:31.320
This is real, and I'm gonna
let you know, I'm not having it.

18:31.410 --> 18:33.118
Everybody's a suspect today.

18:33.204 --> 18:34.781
And I told you, I'm a player.

18:34.872 --> 18:36.865
I don't care about none of that.

18:37.875 --> 18:38.954
Damn!

18:39.043 --> 18:41.249
Get your ass out, player.

18:41.337 --> 18:42.617
Fuck, you remedial!

18:42.713 --> 18:44.587
- What does that mean?
- Retarded!

18:44.674 --> 18:47.295
- That wasn't nothing.
- Dumb-ass, let's go.

18:47.385 --> 18:48.713
I mess up all the time.

18:55.351 --> 18:56.762
Come here! Look!

19:00.022 --> 19:01.979
- That's him!
- Let's get that mother!

19:08.239 --> 19:10.777
Get him! Kick him!

19:12.410 --> 19:14.367
- Craig! Day-Day!
- Uncle Willie!

19:14.453 --> 19:15.864
What the hell you doing to me?

19:15.955 --> 19:18.446
What's happening?

19:18.541 --> 19:19.703
Man, I didn't know!

19:19.792 --> 19:22.248
Pop, I thought
you were somebody else!

19:22.336 --> 19:24.827
Willie, what are you doing
to them boys back there?

19:24.922 --> 19:26.915
Nothing! I'm counting
money at the register.

19:27.008 --> 19:29.131
These fools
knock the hell out of me...

19:29.218 --> 19:32.883
We made a mistake. Day-Day
ran in and jumped on Daddy!

19:32.972 --> 19:34.217
He's lying!

19:34.307 --> 19:36.383
Why you boys
beating up on Santa Claus?

19:36.475 --> 19:38.966
He broke in our house
and stole our presents.

19:39.061 --> 19:41.635
- And Craig let him do it!
- Why, Craig?

19:41.731 --> 19:44.518
- Why blame me?
- 'Cause you did!

19:44.609 --> 19:46.317
I tried to fight him, and Day-Day...

19:46.402 --> 19:48.395
I was screaming,
he wouldn't even help.

19:48.487 --> 19:50.314
What did you do, Day-Day?

19:50.406 --> 19:52.564
Nothing!
He stayed asleep the whole time.

19:52.658 --> 19:54.034
Can I tell my story?

19:54.118 --> 19:57.321
I ain't done shit, but he could have
did something about it!

19:57.413 --> 19:59.038
What did he look like?

19:59.123 --> 20:01.792
Like Bobby Brown
in a goddamned Santa Claus suit!

20:01.876 --> 20:03.121
I heard about him.

20:03.210 --> 20:06.544
They call him
the ''Santa Clause Crook.''

20:06.631 --> 20:08.837
He robbed a lady
in the parking lot last week.

20:08.925 --> 20:11.213
He called her
a ''ho ho ho'' and kept running.

20:11.302 --> 20:12.796
Who the fuck are you?

20:12.887 --> 20:17.715
I'm Cookie, the new waitress,
and, um...

20:17.808 --> 20:20.726
Elroy's new girlfriend.

20:21.604 --> 20:24.059
You got another one?
You're gonna catch something!

20:24.148 --> 20:26.935
You should have kept
Sugar's nasty ass. What happened?

20:27.026 --> 20:29.102
I kicked her country ass
to the curb.

20:29.195 --> 20:31.437
Hooked up with her little sister.

20:31.531 --> 20:33.404
That's how we players roll!

20:33.491 --> 20:39.031
Elroy, read my lips--
you ain't no player!

20:39.121 --> 20:41.743
You don't know nothing
about being a player.

20:41.833 --> 20:46.329
Betty done had your ass
pussy-whipped for about 30 years!

20:46.420 --> 20:48.662
Nobody got me pussy-whipped.

20:48.756 --> 20:52.339
l...whips...pussy!

20:56.180 --> 20:59.596
You boys look really good
with your rent-a-cop outfits on.

20:59.684 --> 21:01.094
Yes, very attractive.

21:01.185 --> 21:04.969
This is Top Flight Security.
We ain't no rent-a-cops.

21:05.064 --> 21:06.558
Daddy, how I look?

21:07.358 --> 21:10.145
- Like a damn snitch!
- Man, that's cold!

21:10.236 --> 21:12.941
Look like you're ready
to tell on somebody right now!

21:13.030 --> 21:15.568
Where's your flashlight at?
You're supposed to have one.

21:15.658 --> 21:17.781
You've got to shine some damn body!

21:17.868 --> 21:21.451
We're supposed to get handcuffs,
flashlights, taser guns--

21:21.539 --> 21:22.737
Two German shepherds.

21:22.832 --> 21:26.450
Y'all must not know what happened
to the last security guards.

21:28.379 --> 21:31.214
Mama's in the kitchen with the sauce.

21:31.299 --> 21:33.090
Aw, shit! The sauce! Move, girl!

21:33.176 --> 21:35.215
What happened
to the other two sec--

21:35.302 --> 21:36.417
Wait a minute!

21:36.512 --> 21:38.303
Go say hello to your grandmother.

21:38.389 --> 21:40.962
Come on, let's go. Move your big ass!

21:41.058 --> 21:43.596
What happened with
the last two security guards?

21:46.397 --> 21:48.722
- Wake up, Mama.
- What the hell you want?

21:48.816 --> 21:51.307
You burned the sauce again.
Give me the spoon.

21:51.402 --> 21:52.896
Nobody's gonna hit you.

21:52.987 --> 21:55.276
You've lost your mind
since Willie slapped you.

21:55.364 --> 21:56.942
Damn, what happened to her?

21:57.033 --> 21:59.702
You should never have let her
into the commercial, anyway.

21:59.785 --> 22:01.244
Got no business working.

22:01.329 --> 22:03.286
You're the one
gave her a concussion, Willie.

22:03.372 --> 22:06.409
- You were supposed to be acting.
- I should have smacked you!

22:06.500 --> 22:07.580
How's she doing?

22:09.045 --> 22:11.417
Hey, Big Mama, you all right?

22:11.505 --> 22:13.747
- Who are you?
- lt's Craig, Mama.

22:13.841 --> 22:15.964
- Who Craig?
- Don't worry about it.

22:16.052 --> 22:19.006
Your oldest grandson.
The smart one, not Day-Day.

22:19.096 --> 22:21.587
She's still having blackouts
and blurred vision.

22:21.682 --> 22:23.141
Bet you remember Day-Day!

22:23.226 --> 22:25.384
Why you always
playing with her all the time?

22:25.478 --> 22:27.636
That's enough
damn salt there, Willie.

22:27.730 --> 22:29.438
I know what I'm doing.

22:29.523 --> 22:31.849
Don't nobody want all that salt
in their potato salad!

22:31.943 --> 22:33.187
Y'all argue too much!

22:33.277 --> 22:35.566
What's wrong with y'all?
Y'all should get married.

22:35.655 --> 22:38.359
Why are you in so much
competition with me?

22:38.449 --> 22:39.860
You jealous, Willie.

22:39.951 --> 22:42.620
I can't help it!
I look better than you do!

22:42.703 --> 22:43.782
You don't.

22:43.871 --> 22:45.496
- I cook better than you.
- You can't.

22:45.581 --> 22:48.748
- My dick is bigger than yours.
- lt was cold that night.

22:48.834 --> 22:52.038
Think--last year at this time,
you had won the Lotto,

22:52.129 --> 22:54.252
over $1 million.

22:54.340 --> 22:57.294
Anybody else would be living
in the French Riviera.

22:57.385 --> 22:59.673
You're back here
cooking pigs' feet with me

22:59.762 --> 23:01.755
at Bros. B-B-B-Bar-B-Q.

23:01.847 --> 23:03.924
You tied-tongued dog catcher!

23:04.016 --> 23:06.934
You best check on the sauce.
Mama's out on her feet again.

23:07.019 --> 23:08.514
Dumb-ass dog catcher.

23:08.604 --> 23:12.104
''I'm a Lotto stud.
Lotto fucking stud.''

23:12.191 --> 23:14.860
So after Pops and Unc argued
for another 15 minutes.

23:14.944 --> 23:16.652
it was time
to meet our new boss.

23:16.737 --> 23:17.852
His name is Moly.

23:17.947 --> 23:21.363
He ran the whole strip mall
and owned Holy Moly Donuts.

23:21.450 --> 23:27.453
But trust me. don't even. even. even.
even. even. even. even eat there.

23:29.625 --> 23:31.582
We'll take the usual, Moly.

23:34.255 --> 23:35.583
How you doing, boy?

23:35.673 --> 23:37.915
Good, buddy.
Merry Christmas, buddy.

23:38.009 --> 23:39.882
Happy Hanukkah. L'claim.

23:39.969 --> 23:41.249
These are my boys.

23:41.345 --> 23:43.421
I'll be with you
in just one minute, buddy.

23:43.514 --> 23:45.590
Take your time.

23:45.683 --> 23:47.592
Just be still.

23:47.685 --> 23:49.345
What's up? How's business?

23:49.437 --> 23:52.188
Everything is wonderful. Yeah, boy!

23:52.273 --> 23:54.064
Have you seen our commercial?

23:54.150 --> 23:56.985
Barbecue so good, makes you
want to smack your mama.

23:57.987 --> 24:01.071
- What the fu--
- Hey, buddy!

24:01.157 --> 24:02.781
What the fuck wrong with you?

24:02.867 --> 24:04.527
Sorry, buddy. Reaction.

24:04.702 --> 24:07.703
Hey, guys, I hear
someone's looking for a job.

24:07.788 --> 24:09.283
I want to ask a question.

24:09.373 --> 24:10.405
l...okay.

24:10.500 --> 24:12.207
When we get our guns?

24:12.293 --> 24:14.914
No guns. You are Top Flight
unarmed security guards.

24:15.004 --> 24:17.542
- What about walkie-talkies?
- And flashlights?

24:17.632 --> 24:21.047
Whoever catch the girl back there
giving head behind the trash can?

24:21.135 --> 24:24.052
I have to come back there
with the flashlight and catch her.

24:24.138 --> 24:27.803
You are supposed to be tough guys.
You don't need gadgets, huh?

24:27.892 --> 24:29.849
All you need is this here.

24:31.354 --> 24:33.430
lf there's any problems,
you just blow. Toot-toot!

24:33.522 --> 24:35.930
These guys are here
all the time. They come running.

24:36.025 --> 24:37.603
Goddamn, Craig!

24:37.693 --> 24:39.816
- Can we have more donuts?
- Please.

24:39.904 --> 24:42.229
See? Very quick
response time, huh?

24:42.323 --> 24:44.114
You guys ready for tour of property?

24:44.200 --> 24:47.366
Give me a twister. Make it two.
Hold the flies.

24:47.453 --> 24:49.778
Keep up. Come on.
One-two, one-two, one-two.

24:49.872 --> 24:50.951
Come on.

24:51.040 --> 24:54.872
Since you've been here many times,
I'm gonna make it short and sweet.

24:54.961 --> 24:56.241
Buddy, come on.

24:56.337 --> 24:58.626
As you know, this here is my place.

24:58.714 --> 25:01.040
This is
the Holy Moly Donut Shop, huh?

25:01.133 --> 25:04.170
Say it with me, guys--
''Holy Moly Donut Shop.''

25:07.056 --> 25:10.140
Very good. You get one
free bear claw every lunch break.

25:13.187 --> 25:14.895
- Come on, guys.
- Come on, come on.

25:14.981 --> 25:19.275
Okay.
Over here is the Chrome Dome.

25:19.360 --> 25:21.234
You got cars, they got rims.

25:21.320 --> 25:24.405
This, of course, is your
family business, Bros. Bar-B-Q.

25:24.490 --> 25:26.696
That's check cashing.
No l.D. required.

25:26.784 --> 25:29.536
This one here
is a brand-new store.

25:29.620 --> 25:33.488
lt's Pimps and Hos--
some kind of flashy clothing.

25:33.583 --> 25:35.243
- Damn!
- Damn!

25:35.334 --> 25:36.994
Who is that?

25:37.086 --> 25:40.087
That's Donna.
She's the owner's girlfriend.

25:40.172 --> 25:43.588
He's a funny-dressing kind of guy
from out of town or something.

25:44.885 --> 25:48.586
He's kind of a pig, though.
He treat her like shit, man.

25:48.681 --> 25:50.839
I would love for her
to be one of my wives, huh?

25:50.933 --> 25:52.641
Damn, how many wives you got?

25:52.727 --> 25:54.766
Me? 12, buddy.

25:54.854 --> 25:56.930
Yeah. All of them freaks, too, huh?

25:57.023 --> 25:59.478
# Freaks come out at night,
what, what, what? #

25:59.567 --> 26:01.109
# Freaks come out at night... #

26:01.193 --> 26:02.569
Whodini. You know Who--

26:02.653 --> 26:04.480
Yeah, buddy! Okay!

26:04.572 --> 26:08.190
He's a character. Real big character.

26:08.284 --> 26:10.075
He's short but big.

26:11.120 --> 26:15.747
# Hold up, wait a minute,
let me put some pimping in it #

26:19.962 --> 26:21.919
He's funny-looking, huh?

26:22.006 --> 26:24.923
I don't know. Why he dress like this?

26:25.009 --> 26:28.093
How are you? Doesn't matter.
Get the trunk.

26:28.179 --> 26:29.210
Thank you.

26:29.305 --> 26:30.633
He's got problems.

26:30.723 --> 26:33.593
Quickly, now, quickly.
Got a business to run.

26:33.684 --> 26:35.926
Hey, buddy.

26:37.480 --> 26:38.974
And don't drag that coat.

26:39.065 --> 26:41.686
lt costs more than you do.

26:42.735 --> 26:45.736
Okay, and over here,
this is a liquor store.

26:45.821 --> 26:48.858
Don't let nobody hang out
in front of liquor store.

26:48.950 --> 26:49.981
Nobody, buddy.

26:50.076 --> 26:51.274
Nobody.

26:51.369 --> 26:54.488
And this is your booth.

26:54.580 --> 26:55.659
Any questions?

26:55.748 --> 26:58.156
- l've got one question.
- What's up, buddy?

26:58.251 --> 27:01.121
What happened to the last guards
that worked here?

27:01.212 --> 27:05.079
You ask too many questions, man.
lt's time to get to work.

27:05.174 --> 27:08.175
Remember, you guys are
Top Flight security guards,

27:08.260 --> 27:10.170
best in the whole world, huh?

27:10.263 --> 27:13.098
You have to defend this whole place
with your own life.

27:13.182 --> 27:14.926
And I'll die for this shit, too.

27:15.017 --> 27:18.267
Remember, Christmas Eve
means lots of shoppers.

27:18.354 --> 27:20.845
lf there's any trouble,
you come get me--

27:20.940 --> 27:23.229
when you take care of it,
then come get me.

27:23.317 --> 27:25.191
Okay, go, go. Come on.

27:25.277 --> 27:27.769
Come on. Keep it real, huh?

27:27.863 --> 27:30.568
When are you gonna ask him
for an advancement

27:30.658 --> 27:32.152
on our first week's pay?

27:32.243 --> 27:34.912
Don't worry about that.
I'll ask when the time is right.

27:34.996 --> 27:36.703
Just keep your rabbit-ass mouth shut.

27:36.789 --> 27:39.660
- Remember what Damon said.
- You remember what I said.

27:39.750 --> 27:44.246
Don't start trying to outthink me,
because you're gonna hurt yourself.

27:45.798 --> 27:47.340
Where you think you going?

27:47.425 --> 27:50.094
- lt's small in here.
- No, you're big in here.

27:52.138 --> 27:54.177
Get off my foot!

27:54.890 --> 27:57.927
- Just scoot over there.
- You scoot over, man!

28:01.856 --> 28:05.189
This shit is uncomfortable, man.
Can't even move in here.

28:05.276 --> 28:07.981
So what? Just deal with it. I got to.

28:09.238 --> 28:10.697
What are we gonna do now?

28:10.781 --> 28:13.107
Sit here and wait
for something to happen.

28:14.660 --> 28:16.487
Not me.

28:16.579 --> 28:18.239
That shit is boring, man.

28:18.331 --> 28:20.952
Good. I like boring.
Easy money for us.

28:21.042 --> 28:23.449
I hope
don't nothing happen all day.

28:23.544 --> 28:26.213
We can sit and watch these females
shop till they drop.

28:26.297 --> 28:28.420
Matter of fact, watch out.

28:30.635 --> 28:33.208
Ain't this a bitch?
I'm waiting on some action to jump off.

28:33.304 --> 28:34.964
You heard what Mr. Moly said.

28:35.056 --> 28:37.725
We Top Flight
security of the world, Craig!

28:37.808 --> 28:40.513
Shit! Not just the city, the world!

28:40.603 --> 28:43.639
Been jacked by Santa Claus,
all kind of shit.

28:43.731 --> 28:45.854
They need security
in the world, Craig!

28:45.942 --> 28:47.056
Shit!

28:47.151 --> 28:49.986
For one thing, calm down.
Slow your roll.

28:51.030 --> 28:54.648
Don't let that man pump you up
and get your ass shot out here.

28:54.742 --> 28:57.862
We ain't no damn
Top Flight security of the world!

28:57.953 --> 29:00.907
We Craig and Day-Day,
so just kick back, relax--

29:00.998 --> 29:03.406
You heard what happened
to the last security guards.

29:03.501 --> 29:05.826
You didn't even hear what happened,

29:05.920 --> 29:08.209
so how the fuck was I gonna hear it?

29:08.297 --> 29:10.586
Just do your job,
and I'm gonna do mine.

29:12.134 --> 29:14.423
- Shit.
- No problem.

29:14.512 --> 29:17.003
- I'm gonna do my job.
- No problem.

29:17.098 --> 29:19.174
Get your damn feet
out of my f--

29:23.145 --> 29:27.439
# Joy to the world,
the Lord is come #

29:27.525 --> 29:30.194
Bingo! I got action.

29:32.071 --> 29:34.028
What's up?

29:34.115 --> 29:37.400
# Let every heart

29:37.493 --> 29:39.901
# And heaven and nature sing... #

29:46.836 --> 29:49.327
Heaven and--

29:49.505 --> 29:53.088
Y'all hos got to get off
this corner with that!

29:53.176 --> 29:54.835
Excuse me, sugar,

29:54.927 --> 29:57.714
You heard me what I said.
Y'all hos got to move off this corner.

29:57.805 --> 29:59.963
You better watch
your little filthy mouth.

30:00.057 --> 30:02.264
You are talking
to children of the Lord.

30:02.351 --> 30:03.466
That's right!

30:03.561 --> 30:06.052
I want you to know
who you're talking to, too--

30:06.147 --> 30:08.638
Top Flight
motherfucking security!

30:08.733 --> 30:11.769
You can't talk to these
old-ass ladies like that!

30:11.861 --> 30:13.770
Just back me up
and do your damn job!

30:13.863 --> 30:15.902
Y'all movin' on
and take that shit--

30:15.990 --> 30:18.825
Wait a minute, bitch!
I ain't no killer, you understand me?

30:18.910 --> 30:20.653
But don't you push me,
don't you touch me!

30:20.745 --> 30:24.078
You gonna make me blow this.
I'll clear all this shit out with this.

30:24.165 --> 30:26.572
Joker, fuck you and your whistle!

30:26.667 --> 30:30.083
Y'all trying to use the Lord
to sell pussy on this corner.

30:30.171 --> 30:32.128
Shut your little filthy mouth!

30:34.008 --> 30:35.586
Calm down.

30:35.676 --> 30:38.796
Let's go on to church, and we
gonna pray for these niggas.

30:38.888 --> 30:41.426
Have mercy, Jesus.
Forgive me, Lord.

30:41.515 --> 30:43.058
What's wrong with you?

30:43.142 --> 30:46.143
You can't talk to people like that.
That's somebody grandmama, fool!

30:46.229 --> 30:48.719
I can talk to people
any fucking way I want to,

30:48.814 --> 30:50.688
and I'm the law around here.

30:50.775 --> 30:53.266
And I'm gonna write your ass up
for insubordination.

30:53.361 --> 30:55.649
Let me do my job and you do yours.

30:55.738 --> 30:57.018
Top Flight!

30:57.114 --> 31:00.199
Man. I couldn't believe
how Day-Day was acting.

31:00.284 --> 31:02.526
Even since he got
that whistle around his neck.

31:02.620 --> 31:05.407
He been acting like
a neal asshole rent-a-cop.

31:05.498 --> 31:07.621
Look at him!

31:07.708 --> 31:09.203
Where you going?

31:09.293 --> 31:11.665
I'm trying to park so I can go
in the check-cashing place.

31:11.879 --> 31:14.963
You can't park right here
because there's a new policy.

31:15.049 --> 31:16.958
Give me the number,
or you can't park here.

31:17.051 --> 31:18.925
I ain't never heard
of no policy like that.

31:19.011 --> 31:22.511
You ain't never met a Top Flight
security nigga like me!

31:22.598 --> 31:25.054
Give me the number
or get to fucking rolling.

31:25.142 --> 31:28.725
Look at that fool.
I've got to put a stop to this shit.

31:28.813 --> 31:30.936
...no parking spot, okay,
'cause I'm married!

31:31.023 --> 31:34.309
- Get this piece of shit out of here!
- He's just playing.

31:34.402 --> 31:36.478
No, I'm not playing.
You better not park!

31:36.570 --> 31:38.278
- Bye-bye.
- Bring that car back here!

31:38.364 --> 31:40.937
Man, what did I do?

31:41.033 --> 31:42.278
I got this.

31:42.368 --> 31:44.776
Why every time you get
a little position of power,

31:44.870 --> 31:46.246
you abuse your authority?

31:46.330 --> 31:48.239
You need to work
on your people skills.

31:48.332 --> 31:51.452
That's bullshit. My people skills
are way better than yours.

31:51.544 --> 31:53.833
Just sit down and relax.

31:57.758 --> 32:00.000
Bingo! Got more action!

32:04.932 --> 32:07.055
Get y'all little bad-ass mo'
over here!

32:07.143 --> 32:09.764
Leave them damn kids alone!
They ain't messing with you!

32:12.857 --> 32:16.060
Stop blowing that goddamn whistle!

32:16.152 --> 32:18.144
What's wrong with you? You tripping!

32:18.237 --> 32:20.396
Some L.A.P.D. shit.

32:20.489 --> 32:23.194
You know what?
Don't hate...appreciate.

32:23.284 --> 32:25.490
You're just mad
'cause I'm always on the...

32:26.954 --> 32:28.283
...crime whistle!

32:28.372 --> 32:30.365
I'll calm your ass down
one way or another.

32:30.458 --> 32:32.996
- You ain't got to calm me down.
- Fire that up.

32:33.085 --> 32:36.122
Not on duty. Not on duty!

32:36.213 --> 32:37.791
You better fire this up!

32:37.882 --> 32:41.381
I ain't no grocery-store bouncer.
I'm a Top Flight security guard.

32:41.469 --> 32:44.220
You got to recognize
the difference between the police--

32:44.305 --> 32:47.555
- Light the shit.
- We are not little no more.

32:47.642 --> 32:49.848
- Come on!
- What?

32:53.773 --> 32:55.053
You know what?

32:55.149 --> 32:57.854
You're not gonna be punking me
when we get 40.

32:57.944 --> 33:00.779
This shit gonna stop one day, dude.

33:00.863 --> 33:04.362
Well, it ain't
gonna stop today, so light it up

33:04.450 --> 33:06.110
before I beat that ass.

33:06.202 --> 33:08.490
- Whatever.
- Yeah, yeah.

33:08.579 --> 33:10.702
This Barney Fife shit.

33:16.128 --> 33:18.417
I'm thinking of something right now.

33:18.506 --> 33:20.214
That's some good shit, right?

33:20.299 --> 33:23.253
no. You're a bad-ass influence
on my life.

33:23.344 --> 33:25.253
Ever since
l've been kicking it with you,

33:25.346 --> 33:27.385
my life
has been a shambles, dude.

33:28.432 --> 33:30.390
Give me my goddamn joint.

33:30.476 --> 33:32.385
Hold on.
Let me hit it one more time.

33:32.478 --> 33:34.767
One more time,
let me hit it, man!

33:34.855 --> 33:36.350
You gave it to me to smoke!

33:36.440 --> 33:39.726
I ain't no bad influence on you.
I'm the best cousin you've got.

33:39.819 --> 33:42.938
lf it wasn't for me, you'd be
getting punked all the time.

33:43.030 --> 33:46.067
And I keep you safe
and I keep you warm,

33:46.158 --> 33:47.866
'cause you know
how little timid you are.

33:47.952 --> 33:49.327
Look. Look.

33:51.372 --> 33:52.403
Whatever.

33:54.500 --> 33:56.576
Man, it's just us,
Craig and Day-Day. Damn!

33:58.754 --> 34:01.043
I was about to Barry Bonds
y'all's black asses!

34:01.132 --> 34:03.005
You almost made me
catch a heart attack!

34:03.176 --> 34:06.046
I ought to hit your ass
and give you brain damage.

34:06.137 --> 34:08.924
Let me hit that before Willie
bring his old square ass out here.

34:09.014 --> 34:12.051
You can go to jail
for some shit like that, for real.

34:12.143 --> 34:14.100
He been real brand-new today.

34:14.187 --> 34:15.645
How's it going out here so far?

34:15.730 --> 34:17.473
lt's been boring and quiet.

34:17.565 --> 34:18.893
Just wait around.

34:18.983 --> 34:21.474
Them young thugs don't come out
till about 1 :00 or 1 :30.

34:21.569 --> 34:24.605
They coming. I just pray to God
I'm here when they come.

34:24.697 --> 34:28.232
Uncle Elroy gonna beat
the shit out of 'em!

34:28.326 --> 34:29.820
Ho ho ho, motherfuckers!

34:29.909 --> 34:32.402
What you looking at
before I shoot you in your mouth?

34:32.496 --> 34:34.489
Up against the wall!

34:34.581 --> 34:36.041
Jesus!

34:36.125 --> 34:38.496
Shut up! What you got, toothpick?

34:38.585 --> 34:40.543
I ain't got nothing.

34:40.630 --> 34:43.666
Done shit on yourself!
What you looking at?

34:43.757 --> 34:45.038
Don't I know you?

34:45.134 --> 34:47.886
You gonna know a bullet in your ass!
This all you got?

34:47.969 --> 34:49.927
I ain't got nothing
but 20 funky-ass dollars.

34:50.014 --> 34:52.386
I ought to shoot your broke ass.

34:52.475 --> 34:53.803
What's up, Al Green?

34:53.893 --> 34:57.344
You remind me of them old players
that be clubbing with young girls.

34:57.438 --> 35:01.483
You remind me of a young nigga
fucking with the wrong old nigga!

35:01.567 --> 35:04.319
He's gonna shoot your ass!
Get up against the wall!

35:04.403 --> 35:06.941
Shut up! Give me the watch!

35:07.031 --> 35:08.406
No, not the Rolie.

35:08.491 --> 35:11.611
Now it's a ''stoley.''
Looking like a Mississippi pimp.

35:11.702 --> 35:14.656
Bitch better have my
sweet potatoes. Top Flight Security!

35:14.747 --> 35:16.953
Merry Christmas, motherfuckers.

35:17.041 --> 35:18.832
Santa Claus got my Rolex!
Let's get him!

35:18.918 --> 35:20.994
Do something! Do something!

35:21.879 --> 35:25.544
- Don't just stand there. Help me.
- Shit! How?

35:26.634 --> 35:28.674
Move, move, move!

35:30.262 --> 35:32.754
...three quarters,
two dimes, and a nickel!

35:37.228 --> 35:39.469
Y'all didn't hear me
blowing this whistle?

35:39.563 --> 35:40.678
What is it, buddy?

35:40.773 --> 35:44.474
We just got jacked by Santa Claus!
He almost tied us up and fucked us!

35:44.569 --> 35:46.810
- He pulled out a pistol...
- Dodo, you on crack, buddy?

35:59.333 --> 36:03.034
- Hey, man, just let it go.
- Get your goddamn hands off me!

36:03.129 --> 36:06.711
Me, my cousin, and my daddy--
we just got jacked by Santa Claus!

36:06.799 --> 36:08.459
But you're security guard, buddy.

36:08.551 --> 36:11.386
That's why I asked your ass
for them two flashlights.

36:13.472 --> 36:14.753
These guys!

36:14.849 --> 36:16.509
That's why I hate the fuckin' law!

36:16.601 --> 36:18.344
Get your fat ass up and do something!

36:18.436 --> 36:20.345
You get up, too!

36:20.438 --> 36:23.604
Give me flashlights,
or we gonna get killed around here!

36:23.691 --> 36:25.767
Jacked by Santa Claus
on Christmas Eve!

36:25.860 --> 36:28.351
Twice in one day!

36:28.446 --> 36:31.815
You wanted to grab somebody,
you should've grabbed that nigga!

36:31.907 --> 36:35.027
Security! You need to
turn in your damn whistle!

36:45.671 --> 36:47.379
Where you going, Mama?

36:47.465 --> 36:49.338
I'm going to make my daily rounds.

36:49.425 --> 36:51.631
Could you make me a sandwich
when you get back?

36:51.719 --> 36:53.712
Make your own damn sandwich.

37:03.647 --> 37:06.732
Tupac. Tupac, Tupac!

37:06.817 --> 37:09.439
Goddamn, you fine!

37:11.781 --> 37:14.272
Ooh, the way

37:31.259 --> 37:33.251
Yoo-hoo!

37:33.344 --> 37:35.420
Anybody home?

37:38.224 --> 37:39.635
Ain't nobody here.

37:41.811 --> 37:44.728
Oh, my goodness.

37:46.774 --> 37:50.060
What in the hell
done happened to the mail?

37:51.946 --> 37:54.235
I ain't the only one they owe.

37:56.117 --> 37:57.611
Dirty bastards.

38:11.674 --> 38:14.295
This child is filthy!

38:20.015 --> 38:22.008
Wishful thinking.

38:27.440 --> 38:28.519
Weed!

38:32.111 --> 38:33.819
Got me some weed!

38:33.905 --> 38:36.905
That's why they ain't paid
their damn rent!

38:40.745 --> 38:43.236
So what happened after that?

38:43.331 --> 38:46.201
I don't want to talk about that.
Y'all ain't gonna catch no damn body.

38:46.292 --> 38:48.961
I just want you to stop and whip
some ass on the way to the station.

38:49.045 --> 38:50.705
Least I'll feel better then.

38:50.796 --> 38:52.588
What were you doing
in the alley, anyway?

38:52.673 --> 38:54.333
I was emptying the trash!

38:54.425 --> 38:56.998
- I had already taken it out.
- Well, it was full!

38:57.094 --> 39:00.012
Don't you mess with this b-b-barbecue.
I'm gonna keep my eye on you.

39:00.097 --> 39:04.047
I don't give a damn 'bout your lazy eye,
you Popeye-lookin' son of a--

39:04.143 --> 39:07.227
Nah, wait a minute!
I started this barbecue shit!

39:07.313 --> 39:10.267
ls this the motherfucking
thanks I get?

39:10.357 --> 39:12.101
That's enough! Calm down!

39:12.193 --> 39:14.897
I just appreciate you
even blessing me with your presence.

39:14.987 --> 39:19.067
Bishop Magic Don Juan
and Money motherfucking Mike!

39:19.158 --> 39:20.569
What they know about that?

39:20.660 --> 39:22.284
Let me get this straight--

39:22.370 --> 39:26.996
for the second time,
y'all got jacked by Santa Claus?

39:27.083 --> 39:28.114
Black guy, wasn't it?

39:28.209 --> 39:31.163
Nah. This was a nigga that did this.

39:31.253 --> 39:33.579
lf I build it, the hos will come.
Learn from the best.

39:33.673 --> 39:36.045
God bless you, Mike.
Keep your game tight, hear, player?

39:36.133 --> 39:37.296
Absolutely.

39:37.385 --> 39:39.045
...got Daddy's Rolex.

39:39.136 --> 39:42.920
# Dashing through these hos
in a one-horse open sleigh... #

39:43.015 --> 39:46.883
Everything is 25% off.
Everything must go.

39:46.978 --> 39:48.721
Maybe even you.

39:49.688 --> 39:51.847
Explain yourself now, player.

39:53.651 --> 39:56.023
- Day-Day!
- Ow, Daddy!

39:56.112 --> 39:57.226
You talk too damn much!

39:57.321 --> 40:00.192
He didn't want to blow
his whistle, so I blew mine.

40:01.492 --> 40:02.772
Pay attention!

40:02.868 --> 40:05.573
That's the reason we got jacked
in the first damn place.

40:05.663 --> 40:08.118
We'll make out our report
and get back to you.

40:09.917 --> 40:12.834
Guys, y'all have to get dressed.
The kids will be here any minute.

40:12.920 --> 40:14.249
Back to work.

40:23.264 --> 40:27.842
I didn't know you can make
a snowman in 80-degree weather.

40:27.935 --> 40:31.269
Anything is possible.
All you need is a can of snow.

40:31.355 --> 40:34.392
What's cracking? My name's Craig.

40:34.483 --> 40:36.275
- I'm Donna.
- What's up, Donna?

40:36.360 --> 40:38.104
What kind of stuff y'all sell in here?

40:38.195 --> 40:41.611
We got everything--
FUBU, Sean John, Dada.

40:41.699 --> 40:43.857
What are you looking for?

40:43.951 --> 40:46.359
Anything's better than what I got on.

40:46.454 --> 40:48.612
What, you don't like the flashlight look?

40:50.416 --> 40:52.290
I see you got jokes.

40:52.376 --> 40:54.535
Well, you can always buy
your girlfriend something.

40:54.628 --> 40:56.206
We have ladies' wear, too.

40:56.297 --> 40:57.672
Yeah, y'all do, huh?

40:57.757 --> 40:59.796
I don't really got
a girlfriend, you know.

40:59.884 --> 41:02.173
I usually get rid of them
this time of year.

41:02.261 --> 41:04.005
That way, you ain't got
to buy them shit.

41:05.223 --> 41:06.800
For real?

41:06.891 --> 41:07.922
Yeah, why not?

41:08.976 --> 41:10.055
I'm just playing.

41:11.187 --> 41:13.938
- I see you got jokes.
- A couple.

41:14.023 --> 41:16.431
So that's your little
midget boyfriend?

41:16.525 --> 41:18.601
Little micro-mini pimp
up in there?

41:20.196 --> 41:21.856
Oh! What's cracking, baby?

41:21.948 --> 41:26.195
My name is Day-Day, right?
This is my big-head-ass cousin.

41:26.285 --> 41:28.693
You know, beevo-latte, got
more head than he got body.

41:28.788 --> 41:30.412
Check this out--

41:30.498 --> 41:32.289
I just spotted you
way across from the lot,

41:32.375 --> 41:35.459
and I'm gonna let you know,
it ain't your booty, it's your beauty.

41:35.544 --> 41:38.083
lf you see anything
suspicious around here...

41:39.924 --> 41:41.833
Let me know, 'cause
I got my eyes on everything.

41:41.926 --> 41:43.301
Let's start off with your number.

41:43.385 --> 41:45.544
That's the only way we're gonna
be able to communicate.

41:45.638 --> 41:47.714
No, you gotta get your ass
back to that booth.

41:47.807 --> 41:49.598
But, man, she like me!

41:57.233 --> 41:58.347
Come on, woman.

41:58.442 --> 42:00.898
I can't move that fast
with this stomach.

42:06.200 --> 42:07.860
Why you got to bring
your ass over here?

42:07.952 --> 42:10.739
I was trying to see if she seen
a Santa Claus with a suit on.

42:10.830 --> 42:14.780
- What your ass doing over here?
- You know what I'm doing over here.

42:16.544 --> 42:18.038
I just don't want no bullshit.

42:18.129 --> 42:19.872
You know, all that
''my hair retain heat.''

42:19.964 --> 42:21.292
I don't know nothin' about that.

42:21.382 --> 42:24.502
I'm sorry.

42:24.593 --> 42:26.503
Fine piece, boy.

42:28.055 --> 42:29.253
She liked me, didn't she?

42:29.348 --> 42:31.637

- Yes, she did.

42:31.726 --> 42:34.264
How she gonna like you
when she like me?

42:34.353 --> 42:36.061
'Cause she hadn't seen me yet.

42:36.147 --> 42:38.898
I wish I hadn't seen you yet.

42:38.983 --> 42:40.098
Can I help you?

42:40.192 --> 42:41.770
I just walked in the store.

42:41.861 --> 42:44.482
Let me look around a little bit. Dang!

42:48.242 --> 42:50.947
I could use some help over here.

42:51.037 --> 42:53.610
Burn a pimp,

42:53.706 --> 42:56.078
That's all you gotta do,
just burn a pimp one time.

42:56.167 --> 42:58.705

with some socks.

42:59.795 --> 43:00.827
Are you all right?

43:00.922 --> 43:02.795
I'm fine, I just--

43:10.139 --> 43:12.262
This can't be happenin',

43:12.350 --> 43:13.844
Oh, no, player!

43:14.852 --> 43:17.141

43:17.229 --> 43:19.934

Think about what
your mama would say.

45:48.172 --> 45:49.750
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

45:49.840 --> 45:52.877
You know what I'm saying?
I got a little razzle-dazzled.

45:52.968 --> 45:55.720
My name is Money Mike, player.

45:59.016 --> 46:01.223
This is my young girl Donna.

46:10.152 --> 46:11.730
I appreciate what y'all did

46:11.821 --> 46:14.109
'cause these cockroaches
would've cleaned me out.

46:14.198 --> 46:16.487
Speaking of cockroaches,
where was your antennas

46:16.575 --> 46:18.983

46:19.078 --> 46:21.995

- You didn't see 'em take anything.

46:22.081 --> 46:24.121
Well, look next time! Use your eyes!

46:24.208 --> 46:27.873
They ain't supposed to just be hazel,

46:27.962 --> 46:30.168
This ain't for play.
I don't do this for fun.

46:30.256 --> 46:31.335
I'm sorry.

46:31.424 --> 46:35.208
Don't be sorry.
Ho, be careful! Lord Je--

46:43.436 --> 46:45.974
You got her trained, nigga, damn!

46:46.063 --> 46:49.267
You can lead a ho to water, player,
but you can't make 'em think.

46:49.358 --> 46:50.603
You dig what I'm sayin'?

46:50.693 --> 46:52.353

Anyway, I need to take care of y'all.

46:54.155 --> 46:55.863
I appreciate

46:55.948 --> 46:57.656
I can't be everywhere at all times.

46:57.741 --> 46:58.773
No charge.

46:58.868 --> 47:00.576
- What about our rent money?

47:09.045 --> 47:11.583

30% off, 40% off?

47:11.672 --> 47:13.914

Might want to shave.
Might want to shave somebody else!

47:53.547 --> 47:55.172
What do you want
for Christmas, young fella?

47:55.258 --> 47:58.377
I want a X-Box with all the games,
all the new gear,

47:58.469 --> 48:00.841
a new Lexus
with a banging system

48:00.930 --> 48:02.472
and chrome feet on it.

48:03.766 --> 48:05.889
Here's my address, Mr. Jones.

48:05.977 --> 48:08.053
Mr. Jones?

48:08.145 --> 48:10.185
No, Santa.

48:10.272 --> 48:12.561
- I'm Santa.
- Bullshit! You Mr. Jones.

48:12.650 --> 48:15.604
I know where you live, too,
so I expect everything by tomorrow.

48:15.695 --> 48:16.726
You feel me?

48:16.821 --> 48:19.229
Put everything in my mom's name.

48:19.323 --> 48:21.696
He don't look like no reindeer,
he look like a pit bull.

48:21.784 --> 48:23.243
Giddy-up, pit bull.

48:23.327 --> 48:27.111
You better stop jumping up and down
before I have to bite your little ass.

48:27.206 --> 48:29.495
Can you lock your jaws
and shake like a pit bull?

48:29.583 --> 48:31.576
Yeah. Want me to show you?

48:31.669 --> 48:34.420
My brother said if a pit bull
locks his jaws like that,

48:34.505 --> 48:36.628
you're supposed to do this to him...

48:39.176 --> 48:41.928
I didn't have to take anything.
lt was all her. Come on, man.

48:42.012 --> 48:43.970

49:07.038 --> 49:08.947
He blowin' smoke in our face

49:09.040 --> 49:10.119
That's bullshit.

49:10.207 --> 49:12.745
I told you there ain't no future
in being a company man.

49:12.835 --> 49:15.326
- Let's just go to lunch.
- Let's go. I'm hungry.

49:16.631 --> 49:18.255

50:12.895 --> 50:15.184

50:16.274 --> 50:18.599
Yo, Big Pimpin', can you hide us?

Pimping ain't easy but--

50:34.375 --> 50:35.406
No!

50:35.501 --> 50:37.494
No? Well, this ain't the Baby Gap.

50:37.586 --> 50:38.997
Get your fake ass out of my way!

50:39.088 --> 50:41.543
Oh, this is bullshit.

50:41.632 --> 50:43.791
I'm in between
a pimp and a hard place.

50:45.052 --> 50:49.964
Donna! Man down!
1 1-30! Pimp in distress!

50:50.057 --> 50:51.635
Oh, Lord, where the hell is Donna?

50:51.726 --> 50:53.932
- Can I help you?

50:54.020 --> 50:56.475

51:53.579 --> 51:55.702

my grandmother and things.

51:55.790 --> 51:56.988
Two new guys--Clyde and Dodo.

51:57.083 --> 51:59.787
You remember what we did
to the last security guards?

51:59.877 --> 52:01.786
Yes, I do, buddy.

52:01.879 --> 52:05.829

52:14.475 --> 52:16.468
They gonna kick our ass
when they catch us.

52:16.560 --> 52:18.636
That's why
they ain't gonna catch us.

52:22.525 --> 52:24.149
Where them rent-a-cops at, huh?

52:26.320 --> 52:29.570

Mind your own fuckin' business.

52:29.657 --> 52:32.112
Come on. Let's just jump
on Moly's car.

52:32.201 --> 52:33.695

lntroduce me to your friend, Craig.

59:21.694 --> 59:25.145
Oh, that's Money Mike.

59:25.239 --> 59:26.899
- That's Donna.
- Hi. Merry Christmas.

59:26.991 --> 59:29.482
This Damon. He live downstairs.

59:31.037 --> 59:33.706
That was like The Matrix!

59:33.789 --> 59:36.459
Got some testosterone problems.

59:36.542 --> 59:39.211
Why don't you go get me
something to drink, please?

59:39.295 --> 59:40.623
Thank you.

59:40.713 --> 59:42.670
- Where is it?
- Right through here.

59:45.009 --> 59:46.040
No, no.

59:48.888 --> 59:51.426
Like to dislocated my shoulder.

59:51.515 --> 59:54.600
Yo, homey, you ever been to the pen?

59:54.685 --> 59:59.810
Hell, no, but thanks for asking.
Won't bother asking you, though.

59:59.899 --> 01:00:02.816
- Uh, Craig?
- Yeah.

01:00:02.902 --> 01:00:04.230
Where your bathroom at, player?

01:00:04.320 --> 01:00:06.063
I got to piss
like a Russian racehorse

01:00:06.155 --> 01:00:08.611
at the Kentucky Derby
with a glue truck behind him.

01:00:12.119 --> 01:00:13.495
Yo, it's right through there.

01:00:13.579 --> 01:00:16.070
I got to pee diddy! About to get it on.

01:00:16.165 --> 01:00:18.372
Hey, don't piss on the seat.

01:00:28.177 --> 01:00:30.466
What's up, O.G., triple O.G.?

01:00:30.554 --> 01:00:32.179
You got that look in your eye.

01:00:32.265 --> 01:00:34.387
Fresh fish on the line, nigga.

01:00:34.475 --> 01:00:36.432
Ain't nothin' like that shit.

01:00:40.022 --> 01:00:42.347
Yeah, baby! Yeah!

01:00:43.526 --> 01:00:47.061
Have to drink a little bit more water.
Smell like ammonia in this bitch.

01:00:47.155 --> 01:00:48.814
Come on. There you go.

01:00:50.658 --> 01:00:53.445
One at a time, player, one at a time.

01:00:53.536 --> 01:00:55.196
Busy right now,
working with a monster.

01:00:55.287 --> 01:00:56.996
You know what this is, new booty!

01:00:57.081 --> 01:00:58.955
- New booty?
- Don't fight the shit.

01:00:59.041 --> 01:01:00.536
- Fight what shit?
- Let it happen.

01:01:00.626 --> 01:01:02.749
Let what happen?
What the hell you doing?

01:01:02.837 --> 01:01:05.328
Phone books? Nigga,
I ain't even in the phone book.

01:01:05.423 --> 01:01:08.839
This ain't funny, nigga.
I'll bitch-slap your ass.

01:01:08.926 --> 01:01:10.207
Come on, I ain't playin'.

01:01:10.302 --> 01:01:12.793
No!

01:01:14.098 --> 01:01:16.969
Here's my card right here
if y'all ever want to be pimped.

01:01:17.059 --> 01:01:18.174
Day-Day.

01:01:18.269 --> 01:01:21.305
Better not let Pinky see that shit.
We ought to give it to him, though.

01:01:21.397 --> 01:01:22.975
That's a barbecue card.

01:01:23.065 --> 01:01:26.019
Don't give a fuck. That's where
I'm pimping, out of the barbecue place.

01:01:26.110 --> 01:01:29.479
Come and get
barbecue-slapped. Shit.

01:01:31.532 --> 01:01:33.988
Sneaky son of a bitch.

01:01:34.076 --> 01:01:35.950
Damn, he's been
in there a long time.

01:01:36.037 --> 01:01:37.495
I told you he was sick.

01:01:37.580 --> 01:01:39.786
He might be in there
throwing up anything.

01:01:39.874 --> 01:01:41.534
Why don't we just step in here?

01:01:41.625 --> 01:01:43.452
We can sit down
and wait for him in here.

01:01:44.795 --> 01:01:46.254
All right.

01:01:55.848 --> 01:01:59.264
You got a nice room here.
Pretty clean for a bachelor.

01:01:59.352 --> 01:02:02.934
I got a nice bed, too.
Wanna try it?

01:02:03.022 --> 01:02:05.809
- You funny, huh?
- I'm not trying to be funny.

01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:08.936
I'm trying to spread
a little holiday cheer,

01:02:09.028 --> 01:02:11.519
get close to you.

01:02:14.033 --> 01:02:17.034
So, what brings you to California

01:02:17.119 --> 01:02:20.204
with this little
half-a-Prince motherfucker?

01:02:20.289 --> 01:02:22.365
You know, I ask myself
that same question.

01:02:22.458 --> 01:02:25.329
What am I doing way out here,

01:02:25.419 --> 01:02:30.544
away from my family
this time of year?

01:02:30.633 --> 01:02:33.503
But it's just hard.

01:02:33.594 --> 01:02:36.002
Shit, just leave.

01:02:36.097 --> 01:02:38.588
You don't understand.
lt's not that easy.

01:02:39.809 --> 01:02:42.513
I mean, he got you
all the way out here

01:02:42.603 --> 01:02:46.186
so he can, you know,
mistreat you,

01:02:46.274 --> 01:02:48.065
do all them things to you--

01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:50.439
you know, I want
to do some things to you

01:02:50.528 --> 01:02:52.437
that, um...

01:02:53.489 --> 01:02:55.980
You sure you don't want
to just, like, lean back?

01:02:56.075 --> 01:02:58.281
What you think?

01:03:01.247 --> 01:03:02.527
No!

01:03:02.623 --> 01:03:03.951
Don't do it!

01:03:04.041 --> 01:03:05.370
You got some condoms?

01:03:05.459 --> 01:03:07.666
Day-Day, get the hell out of here!

01:03:07.753 --> 01:03:10.375
You know damn well you got
all the rubbers in your--

01:03:10.464 --> 01:03:13.300
Get the fuck out of here!

01:03:13.384 --> 01:03:15.175
She liked me anyway, didn't you?

01:03:16.303 --> 01:03:17.502
You're a trip.

01:03:17.597 --> 01:03:20.088
You know what? Don't pay
no attention to Day-Day.

01:03:20.183 --> 01:03:22.638
- That boy, he just a fool.
- You know what?

01:03:22.727 --> 01:03:25.681
Let's just go before
Mike comes busting in on us.

01:03:26.689 --> 01:03:30.556
And, Craig, a word of advice--
you should get a lock on this door.

01:03:32.528 --> 01:03:34.568
I ain't never gonna get no pussy.

01:03:35.698 --> 01:03:38.449
What if I tried to get
a lock right now and just--

01:03:40.286 --> 01:03:41.566
All right. God!

01:03:42.663 --> 01:03:45.333
- Come on out of there!
- Pop, what's the matter?

01:03:45.416 --> 01:03:46.697
Who's in the bathroom?

01:03:46.792 --> 01:03:48.583
That eggnog about
to kick back up on me.

01:03:48.669 --> 01:03:49.950
You know I got them bad guts.

01:03:50.046 --> 01:03:52.287
Man, Pops gotta boo-boo, come on!

01:03:52.381 --> 01:03:54.006
Don't tell everybody!

01:03:54.092 --> 01:03:55.633
Hey, you know what?

01:03:55.718 --> 01:03:58.090
The lady will let you
use it downstairs, the landlady.

01:03:58.179 --> 01:03:59.210
Miss Pearly.

01:03:59.305 --> 01:04:01.547
Go on down. She'll let you use it.

01:04:01.641 --> 01:04:03.468
Come on out of there, man!

01:04:05.895 --> 01:04:07.354
Honey, where you going?

01:04:07.438 --> 01:04:09.727
I'll be right back. Oh, boy!

01:04:32.755 --> 01:04:34.831
All right!

01:04:35.925 --> 01:04:37.502
All right!

01:04:37.593 --> 01:04:40.629
I'm Craig's daddy--Willie Jones.

01:04:40.721 --> 01:04:43.343
As you know, we're having
a little get-together upstairs,

01:04:43.432 --> 01:04:45.555
and the bathrooms are jammed.

01:04:45.643 --> 01:04:47.351
I like the way you got that lined up.

01:04:47.436 --> 01:04:49.061
Mind if I use yours?

01:04:49.271 --> 01:04:50.552
No. Come on in.

01:04:50.648 --> 01:04:52.854
- Where's it at?
- Down the hall.

01:04:52.942 --> 01:04:54.353
Thank you.

01:04:58.906 --> 01:05:00.733
All right, there we go.

01:05:03.411 --> 01:05:06.032
There we go. About time.

01:05:06.122 --> 01:05:08.447
Oh, just what I needed so bad.

01:05:09.708 --> 01:05:12.579
Yeah, there it is.

01:05:20.261 --> 01:05:21.375
How you doing?

01:05:21.470 --> 01:05:24.140
Show me what you working with.

01:05:24.223 --> 01:05:26.548
- Oh, damn!
- What's wrong with you, fool?

01:05:26.642 --> 01:05:28.350
That's my woman you're dancing with.

01:05:28.436 --> 01:05:30.309
Hey, fool, your woman's
freaking with me!

01:05:30.396 --> 01:05:31.807
I bought them titties!

01:05:31.897 --> 01:05:33.143
What's wrong with you?

01:05:33.399 --> 01:05:34.941
I'll bust a cap right in your fat ass.

01:05:35.025 --> 01:05:36.270
Don't mess up the party, Elroy.

01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:39.278
Dance with me, dance with me.
Come on, dance with me.

01:05:45.119 --> 01:05:46.743
Did you pee on me?

01:05:46.829 --> 01:05:49.949
Wake your bitch-ass up,
Lucky Charms.

01:05:50.041 --> 01:05:52.531
I like my fish wet and squirmy.

01:05:52.626 --> 01:05:55.960
I thought I was dreaming.
You almost drowned me, nigga.

01:05:56.047 --> 01:05:58.502
Oh, you dreaming. This a wet dream.

01:05:58.591 --> 01:06:00.963
Wet dream?
Wait a minute, I'm a pimp!

01:06:01.052 --> 01:06:03.128
You lost your mind? What the hell?!

01:06:03.220 --> 01:06:04.300
Am I in prison?

01:06:04.388 --> 01:06:06.297
Donna! Pimp down!

01:06:09.226 --> 01:06:11.848
You got a lot of balls!

01:06:13.355 --> 01:06:17.056
Pimpin', pimpin', pimpin'!

01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:23.605
You was just gonna take it,
wasn't you? Hmm?

01:06:23.699 --> 01:06:25.656
You thought I was
play-pimping, didn't you?

01:06:25.743 --> 01:06:27.486
Yeah, okay, okay.

01:06:31.082 --> 01:06:32.991
- Could you just let me go?
- Say something.

01:06:33.084 --> 01:06:35.753
I was just playing with you.

01:06:35.836 --> 01:06:37.829
I was playing with you, dawg.

01:06:37.922 --> 01:06:39.464
I was playing, man, okay?

01:06:39.549 --> 01:06:41.837
I'm a nice guy
when you get to know me.

01:06:41.926 --> 01:06:44.796
Shut up! What the hell
you talking about?

01:06:44.887 --> 01:06:47.674
I am a boy!

01:06:47.765 --> 01:06:51.597
You are not in prison
anymore, Damon!

01:06:51.686 --> 01:06:53.512
That's not how we do it!

01:06:55.272 --> 01:06:59.056
Say, noog! This is Pinky, noogah!
Look, I got to go pee-pee!

01:06:59.151 --> 01:07:02.271
Uh, Damon, are you a music lover?

01:07:02.363 --> 01:07:04.984
You are? Good. Have you
ever heard of The Nutcracker?

01:07:05.074 --> 01:07:07.316
Oh, shit!

01:07:07.410 --> 01:07:08.987
Have you, huh? Have you heard it?

01:07:09.078 --> 01:07:10.406
Huh? Huh?

01:07:10.496 --> 01:07:12.987
Yes. Yes.

01:07:14.625 --> 01:07:18.208
# Crunching on your balls
in a one-horse open sleigh... #

01:07:22.300 --> 01:07:23.710
Mom, what's the matter?

01:07:23.801 --> 01:07:26.043
Where did your father go?

01:07:26.137 --> 01:07:28.343
He just went downstairs
to use the bathroom

01:07:28.431 --> 01:07:30.340
over at Miss Pearly's, the landlady.

01:07:30.433 --> 01:07:34.810
Oh, Miss Pearly. Hmm...

01:07:34.895 --> 01:07:36.093
Excuse me.

01:07:39.525 --> 01:07:40.723
Mama.

01:07:41.819 --> 01:07:43.527
Oh, shit!

01:07:43.613 --> 01:07:44.775
Hey!

01:07:46.657 --> 01:07:49.777
Should be a law against
people with guts like mine.

01:07:49.869 --> 01:07:52.407
That was a monster--
Why it so dark in here, baby?

01:07:52.496 --> 01:07:54.370
What are you about to do,
pray or something?

01:07:54.457 --> 01:07:56.698
Did your son tell you I said hi?

01:07:58.794 --> 01:08:00.586
No. Pertaining to what?

01:08:00.671 --> 01:08:03.458
Your son Craig
ain't paid his rent this month,

01:08:03.549 --> 01:08:06.669
and I'm about to throw him
out on his ass tomorrow.

01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:09.216
So how much do you
really love your boy?

01:08:09.305 --> 01:08:12.887
Not enough to pay his fucking rent.
I have enough trouble paying my own!

01:08:12.975 --> 01:08:15.810
I'm not talking about rent,
Willie Jones.

01:08:15.895 --> 01:08:18.053
Well, what you talking about,
Miss Pearly?

01:08:18.147 --> 01:08:20.270
I'm talking about these nuts!

01:08:22.651 --> 01:08:24.977
You're gonna give me
some of this dick today!

01:08:25.071 --> 01:08:26.862
I don't even know you, woman!

01:08:26.948 --> 01:08:28.774
I heard they call you
''Sweet-Dick Willie.''

01:08:28.866 --> 01:08:30.064
- Who, me?
- Yeah!

01:08:30.158 --> 01:08:31.902
- You heard that, huh?
- Yeah.

01:08:31.993 --> 01:08:33.952
Yes, baby, I'm a bad mother.

01:08:34.037 --> 01:08:37.537
- Can I have some of it?
- Let me go, woman! Hell, no!

01:08:37.625 --> 01:08:38.738
I don't know you, woman!

01:08:38.834 --> 01:08:40.245
Oh, Sweet-Dick Willie!

01:08:40.336 --> 01:08:42.661
Willie, get your ass off that heifer!

01:08:43.631 --> 01:08:46.122
Daddy, get your ass off that heifer!

01:08:49.011 --> 01:08:51.087
Yeah, pimping!

01:08:53.432 --> 01:08:56.184
That's right.

01:08:56.269 --> 01:08:58.392
Hey, I want everybody back!

01:08:58.479 --> 01:09:00.886
There's gonna be
ball juice everywhere!

01:09:00.981 --> 01:09:02.808
Everybody get back!

01:09:02.899 --> 01:09:04.229
Get back in the house!

01:09:05.861 --> 01:09:08.317
Don't take anybody!

01:09:09.490 --> 01:09:11.198
Y'all get the hell
out of my house!

01:09:11.283 --> 01:09:13.157
My dick wouldn't get hard!

01:09:13.243 --> 01:09:15.035
Whip his ass, Mama!

01:09:15.121 --> 01:09:17.694
Miss Pearly, you ain't right,
trying to give my daddy V.D.

01:09:17.790 --> 01:09:19.783
I'm calling the police on y'all, fool!

01:09:19.875 --> 01:09:22.117
Well, get that lined up,
too, first, bitch!

01:09:22.211 --> 01:09:23.540
Go to hell!

Another Friday gone.

01:18:37.558 --> 01:18:39.302
Wejust took oun stuff
back to the panty

01:18:39.393 --> 01:18:42.513
and left Santa Claus on the roof
for the police to get.

01:18:42.605 --> 01:18:47.231

getting chased by Damon

01:18:54.075 --> 01:18:55.569
all through the 'hood.

01:18:55.660 --> 01:18:58.660
There's a loud party upstairs
that's keeping me up.

01:18:58.746 --> 01:19:00.988
Could you please send a unit?

01:19:01.082 --> 01:19:03.158
Miss Peanly kept on hating on us.

01:19:03.250 --> 01:19:06.038
We didn't even cane.
We kept on partying.

01:19:06.128 --> 01:19:08.584
My uncle got drunk
and eventually passed out.

01:19:08.672 --> 01:19:10.333
And look at Pops--

01:19:10.424 --> 01:19:13.674
You know. he showed his ass
till the po-pos came.

01:19:13.761 --> 01:19:17.972
- Open the door! Let's do this!
- Put down the b-b-b-b-barbecue.

01:19:18.057 --> 01:19:19.848
But all they wanted
was some mone weed.

01:19:19.934 --> 01:19:21.214
So we looked them up.

01:19:21.310 --> 01:19:25.059
and I even kept
Day-Day's dumb ass occupied.

01:19:25.147 --> 01:19:26.642
And a German shepherd mix!

01:19:29.818 --> 01:19:32.356
That's till

01:19:32.446 --> 01:19:35.780
And me. you know how a player do.

01:19:35.867 --> 01:19:38.073
I convinced Donna
to bring her fine ass

01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:39.619
back to the panty.

01:19:39.703 --> 01:19:41.198

01:19:41.288 --> 01:19:43.411
slid the dresser
in fnont of the door.

01:19:43.499 --> 01:19:46.121
