00:11.693 --> 00:13.776
<i>Previously on
The Pillars of the Earth:</i>

00:14.979 --> 00:16.883
<i>Stephen's army
has us surrounded.</i>

00:17.003 --> 00:19.081
We've been besieged for weeks.

00:19.414 --> 00:21.799
I'm Tom Builder.
We'd like to repair your church.

00:21.919 --> 00:24.339
We'll quarry this stone
to build our new cathedral.

00:24.407 --> 00:26.209
<i>When my chisel
hits the rock,</i>

00:26.329 --> 00:28.357
it's a song of what will be.

00:29.580 --> 00:31.392
<i>Kingsbridge gets
the rents, the tolls.</i>

00:31.440 --> 00:32.679
It gets the taxes,
the business.

00:32.689 --> 00:35.383
As of next month,
the market moves to Shiring.

00:36.886 --> 00:37.702
Pray with me.

00:37.727 --> 00:39.068
<i>That boy with red hair,</i>

00:39.188 --> 00:40.514
I want him dead by morning.

00:42.450 --> 00:43.892
He can't be dead.

00:49.240 --> 00:50.644
They've captured the king.

00:51.202 --> 00:53.175
I claim you as my prisoner.

00:53.295 --> 00:55.097
- Your brother's been taken.
- Oh God!

00:55.217 --> 00:58.306
Your king lies in a dungeon
to be hanged tomorrow.

00:58.374 --> 01:00.011
Why shouldn't you hang
with him?

01:00.409 --> 01:03.278
All you have to say is
that you betrayed Bartholomew.

01:04.149 --> 01:05.200
Yes! Yes!

01:05.319 --> 01:06.874
See that he's hanged.

02:14.760 --> 02:16.556
That's it.

02:21.157 --> 02:23.291
Forgive me God,
for I have sinned.

02:23.292 --> 02:24.759
I am king.

02:25.537 --> 02:27.962
I am king.
You have made me king.

02:28.964 --> 02:30.832
You have made me king.

02:44.180 --> 02:46.281
...forgiveness
for your sins?

02:53.889 --> 02:57.025
Do you ask God's forgiveness
for all your sins?

03:03.132 --> 03:05.567
Do you ask God's forgiveness
for all your sins?

03:07.470 --> 03:08.803
Dear God!

03:12.108 --> 03:13.475
Philip.

03:21.851 --> 03:25.086
If you wish Maud to make
your son Earl of Shiring,

03:25.087 --> 03:27.755
I need to successfully trade
Stephen with Gloucester.

03:27.756 --> 03:30.892
I'll contribute to the ransom
fee, if that's your concern.

03:30.893 --> 03:32.560
No, my concern is Stephen.

03:32.561 --> 03:35.130
If he is redeemed,
will the war continue?

03:35.131 --> 03:36.831
Undoubtedly.

03:36.832 --> 03:40.702
Therefore Queen Maud
may not rule for long,

03:40.703 --> 03:42.871
and then, whose side are we on?

03:42.872 --> 03:45.006
We need to play both sides.

03:45.007 --> 03:47.509
Oh, I intend to
do that as negotiator,

03:47.510 --> 03:51.279
but your position
is not as flexible.

03:51.280 --> 03:53.414
Are you with Maud
or are you against her?

03:53.415 --> 03:55.683
That's what Stephen will think.

03:55.684 --> 03:59.420
And as of this moment,
you are most decidedly with.

03:59.421 --> 04:00.822
Well then, if he wins,

04:00.823 --> 04:03.758
you will have to
intercede for us.

04:06.629 --> 04:09.464
You presume our position
is that of equals,

04:09.465 --> 04:12.000
I need you to serve me,
not command me.

04:19.541 --> 04:22.443
Dear Lady, you mistake
my meaning entirely.

04:22.444 --> 04:25.146
Well, then, what would
Your Eminence have me do?

04:25.147 --> 04:27.282
Whatever your wish,
I am happy to obey.

04:33.756 --> 04:36.191
I wish to be made
Archbishop of Canterbury

04:36.192 --> 04:38.026
once Stephen
regains his throne.

04:38.027 --> 04:40.995
The current one will have
to be removed, of course.

04:49.638 --> 04:51.139
Drink this, brother.

04:55.144 --> 04:56.411
How did I come here?

04:56.412 --> 04:58.713
I told the executioner that,

04:58.714 --> 04:59.914
as the Queen's secretary,

04:59.915 --> 05:01.616
I would answer for
your innocence.

05:01.617 --> 05:04.052
But I thought
you supported Stephen?

05:04.053 --> 05:05.720
Shhh!

05:05.721 --> 05:07.622
He's as self-serving
as his predecessor.

05:07.623 --> 05:10.592
I've become a
politician, Philip.

05:10.593 --> 05:12.894
I serve who best serves me.

05:14.597 --> 05:16.898
And I hear you
have a cathedral?

05:16.899 --> 05:19.100
Not yet. I need a
few miracles first.

05:19.101 --> 05:21.202
Then let us
give thanks, brother.

05:21.203 --> 05:23.571
This is a day for miracles.

05:23.572 --> 05:26.207
I found you,
Maud is now in power.

05:26.208 --> 05:30.445
And the dead have
returned to life.

05:30.446 --> 05:35.250
They found him crawling
from a mass grave.

05:44.460 --> 05:46.527
You're a new man, Jack.

05:46.528 --> 05:48.062
A Lazarus.

05:49.531 --> 05:51.599
I'm sure I stink like Lazarus.

05:53.669 --> 05:56.271
You must have died too,
from the look of you.

05:56.272 --> 05:58.006
Nearly.

05:58.007 --> 06:00.508
God has further plans for me.
For you too, I suspect.

06:00.509 --> 06:02.243
What plans?

06:05.581 --> 06:07.782
What do you remember
of the last 3 days?

06:07.783 --> 06:09.250
Did you pray?

06:09.251 --> 06:11.386
I was laying with the dead.

06:12.855 --> 06:15.256
I suppose I don't remember.

06:17.593 --> 06:19.661
I dreamt, though.
I remember that.

06:19.662 --> 06:21.162
What of?

06:22.598 --> 06:24.198
Of Aliena.

06:55.230 --> 06:56.364
Lovely evening.

06:56.365 --> 06:57.832
What are you doing here?

06:57.833 --> 07:00.601
I just came out
to look at the moon.

07:00.602 --> 07:02.970
No. No, wait!

07:02.971 --> 07:05.973
Aliena, don't go.
I can't swim very well!

07:05.974 --> 07:07.041
Help!

07:07.042 --> 07:08.876
Aliena! Help!

07:16.051 --> 07:17.919
Alfred?

07:39.608 --> 07:41.376
Don't come near me again.

07:42.678 --> 07:43.711
What?

07:48.050 --> 07:49.851
But I love you!

07:51.887 --> 07:53.688
I love you!

08:02.531 --> 08:05.299
- The Empress's terms
are non-negotiable.

08:05.300 --> 08:08.236
Stephen must sign a document
acknowledging her sovereignty

08:08.237 --> 08:10.204
and leave the country forever.

08:10.205 --> 08:13.074
In addition, you will pay Maud
1,000 pounds in gold

08:13.075 --> 08:15.910
and hand over Robert of
Gloucester in good health.

08:17.346 --> 08:19.080
Interesting.

08:19.081 --> 08:21.749
We were gonna ask
1,000 pounds from you.

08:23.051 --> 08:25.987
Why not cancel the ransom fees
and proceed from there?

08:25.988 --> 08:28.289
Your Eminence,
may I have a word?

08:29.792 --> 08:31.359
We need the fee

08:31.360 --> 08:32.960
in order to bankrupt them.

08:32.961 --> 08:35.395
Otherwise, what guarantee
do we have

08:35.397 --> 08:38.533
that Stephen won't ignore
anything that he signs

08:38.534 --> 08:40.534
and begin a war again?

08:40.535 --> 08:43.371
We need a guarantee.

08:44.740 --> 08:47.008
If we ignore the ransom fees,

08:48.010 --> 08:51.245
we need to hold
Stephen's son, Eustace,

08:51.246 --> 08:53.114
until his father
has left the country

08:53.115 --> 08:55.016
and peace has been kept
for 5 years.

08:55.017 --> 08:56.584
King Stephen will never agree.

08:56.585 --> 08:58.085
It's not his decision.

09:01.423 --> 09:04.759
Think about it overnight...

09:04.760 --> 09:06.994
dear Richard.

09:11.066 --> 09:13.434
No one at Maud's court

09:13.435 --> 09:15.369
knows what Eustace
looks like, do they?

09:35.724 --> 09:37.358
And what's your name?

09:37.359 --> 09:38.559
Elizabeth.

09:38.560 --> 09:41.128
That's a pretty name.
How old are you, Elizabeth?

09:41.129 --> 09:42.230
I'm 12.

09:43.298 --> 09:44.999
You're a very pretty girl...

09:45.000 --> 09:47.335
with very pretty lips.

09:47.336 --> 09:48.970
Has anyone ever told you that?

10:02.518 --> 10:04.418
Good day, Bishop.

10:08.657 --> 10:11.058
I thought you were for Stephen.

10:31.213 --> 10:33.481
Do you see these people
before us, Henry?

10:33.482 --> 10:34.849
Yes, Mama.

10:34.850 --> 10:37.818
They've come to ask us favors.
Do you know why?

10:37.819 --> 10:38.920
You're the Queen.

10:38.921 --> 10:40.588
I'm the Empress.

10:40.589 --> 10:43.090
I rechristened myself
this morning.

10:43.091 --> 10:46.027
And one day,
you will be Emperor,

10:46.028 --> 10:48.462
and people will come
to ask you favors.

10:48.463 --> 10:50.598
So I want you to listen.

10:50.599 --> 10:53.834
Francis, you may speak first.

10:53.835 --> 10:57.271
And who is this handsome man?

10:57.272 --> 11:00.241
This is my brother,
Philip, Empress,

11:00.242 --> 11:02.176
the Prior of Kingsbridge.

11:02.177 --> 11:04.378
Handsome, I pray,
before God, Empress,

11:04.379 --> 11:07.014
but, uh, very plain to others.

11:07.015 --> 11:10.851
Humility and humor,
a rare combination.

11:10.852 --> 11:14.488
You ask us to grant you
a license to hold a market?

11:14.489 --> 11:16.490
The income from which
will be used

11:16.491 --> 11:18.292
to finish building a cathedral.

11:18.293 --> 11:20.094
Finish? How did you pay
to start it?

11:20.095 --> 11:22.563
We had a license, Empress,
but it was lost.

11:22.564 --> 11:25.232
King Steph...
Uh, the usurper Stephen refused

11:25.233 --> 11:26.534
to grant us an other.

11:26.535 --> 11:27.602
Why is that?

11:27.603 --> 11:30.071
He kept his reasons to himself.

11:30.072 --> 11:32.506
May I speak, My Empress?

11:32.507 --> 11:35.343
The market at Kingsbridge
was closed,

11:35.344 --> 11:37.812
because it took money
from the one at Shiring.

11:37.813 --> 11:41.282
The rule is that markets must
be at least 14 miles apart.

11:41.283 --> 11:43.451
Kingsbridge and Shiring are 20.

11:43.452 --> 11:45.853
Stephen nevertheless decided...

11:45.854 --> 11:48.756
What Stephen decided
is of no interest to us.

11:48.757 --> 11:51.726
You also ask the right to take
stone from the Shiring quarry.

11:51.727 --> 11:54.662
We have had those rights
for years until William...

11:54.663 --> 11:58.099
I closed the quarry
in retaliation

11:58.100 --> 11:59.667
for his illegal market.

11:59.668 --> 12:01.402
Who owns the quarry?

12:01.403 --> 12:02.436
We do, My Empress,

12:02.437 --> 12:03.838
It was the usurper Stephen

12:03.839 --> 12:06.140
that allowed Kingsbridge
to take the stones.

12:06.141 --> 12:09.443
A foolish bequest, giving
quarry rights to one party,

12:09.444 --> 12:11.178
yet letting another mine it.

12:11.179 --> 12:13.414
We quite agree.

12:13.415 --> 12:16.584
The quarry and all its mining
rights shall belong to Shiring.

12:16.585 --> 12:18.119
Thank you, My Empress.

12:18.120 --> 12:20.688
On the condition that you
successfully negotiate

12:20.689 --> 12:23.457
the release of
our brother Gloucester

12:23.458 --> 12:25.826
from the enemy.

12:25.827 --> 12:28.729
Kingsbridge, however,
shall have similar market rights

12:28.730 --> 12:30.531
to Shiring.

12:30.532 --> 12:32.166
The same condition applies.

12:32.167 --> 12:33.934
Thank you, Empress.

12:40.976 --> 12:45.346
In addition, Henry here would
like a toy from each of you.

12:47.482 --> 12:48.783
And I'd like a toy, too.

12:48.784 --> 12:52.987
100 pounds or your requests
will be denied.

12:52.988 --> 12:54.855
Next.

12:57.125 --> 12:58.292
Can you borrow it?

12:58.293 --> 13:00.261
Money lenders charge
exorbitant interest.

13:00.262 --> 13:01.462
I could never pay it back.

13:01.463 --> 13:02.730
No one else?

13:02.731 --> 13:04.465
A merchant who benefits
from the market?

13:04.466 --> 13:06.100
He might find it
to his advantage.

13:06.101 --> 13:07.134
- She.
- What?

13:07.135 --> 13:08.502
She.

13:09.504 --> 13:11.405
I did her a favor once.

13:13.942 --> 13:15.643
We've just received the word!

13:15.644 --> 13:17.044
What? Martha,
what is it?

13:17.045 --> 13:18.646
Jack's alive!

13:27.522 --> 13:29.056
- What? Martha,
- Jack, Jack, Jack! is it?

13:30.992 --> 13:32.626
Hey, Jack!

13:32.694 --> 13:34.662
Jack!

13:36.131 --> 13:38.265
Jack!

13:39.868 --> 13:41.569
Brother, welcome home.

13:41.636 --> 13:43.504
Welcome home!

13:43.572 --> 13:45.239
Welcome back, Jack!

13:46.508 --> 13:48.275
Good to see you, man!

13:50.979 --> 13:52.947
Prior Philip is back.

14:21.276 --> 14:23.811
100 pounds?
I'd lend it to you gladly,

14:23.812 --> 14:26.881
but I need it to buy
next's year's wool.

14:26.882 --> 14:28.649
When would you
need it returned?

14:28.650 --> 14:30.351
Early spring.
Can you manage it?

14:30.352 --> 14:31.685
No.

14:31.686 --> 14:32.887
No, not unless...

14:32.888 --> 14:34.889
Why can't I sell you
next year's wool?

14:34.890 --> 14:37.758
- You haven't got it yet.
- I will in the spring.

14:37.759 --> 14:39.260
You'd sell it in advance?

14:39.261 --> 14:41.495
Pay me now and I give you
the first shearing.

14:41.496 --> 14:43.330
I never heard of
it done like that.

14:43.331 --> 14:44.398
Why shouldn't it be?

14:44.399 --> 14:45.733
I'd have to offer you

14:45.734 --> 14:46.867
a lower price for it

14:46.868 --> 14:48.369
than you'd get by waiting.

14:48.370 --> 14:50.371
The price for wool
goes up in the spring.

14:50.372 --> 14:52.039
I could keep building in winter

14:52.040 --> 14:53.741
and everybody
would be employed.

14:53.742 --> 14:56.210
So I give you 100 pounds,
you give it to Maud

14:56.211 --> 14:57.378
and you get a license?

14:57.379 --> 14:58.579
The same as Shiring.

14:58.580 --> 15:00.080
In addition to
the Sunday market,

15:00.081 --> 15:01.916
Shiring has the
annual fleece fair.

15:01.917 --> 15:04.051
That's where I make
most of my money.

15:04.052 --> 15:06.053
I... I don't follow.

15:06.054 --> 15:07.655
Why don't we have one here?

15:07.656 --> 15:10.224
If the license is
the same as Shiring's,

15:10.225 --> 15:13.360

the way up there for, Jonathan?

33:57.084 --> 33:58.184
Brother Jonathan.

33:58.185 --> 33:59.953
Brother Jonathan.

33:59.954 --> 34:01.354
So I can see Jack.

34:01.355 --> 34:03.489
He's gone away and
he hasn't said good-bye.

34:06.994 --> 34:08.261
Sit down.

34:20.808 --> 34:23.943
Jack went away because
he'd done something bad.

34:26.981 --> 34:28.514
He hurt Alfred.

34:28.514 --> 34:30.116
Like Cain hurt Abel?

34:30.117 --> 34:32.452
No, not as bad as that,

34:32.453 --> 34:35.722
but anyway. Jack and Alfred
are not really brothers.

34:35.723 --> 34:37.422
Isn't Jack your son?

34:37.424 --> 34:40.693
Well, I'm raising...
was raising... Jack

34:40.694 --> 34:41.995
as a favor to Ellen,

34:43.030 --> 34:44.864
like Johnny Eightpence
raises you.

34:44.864 --> 34:47.967
He isn't my mother,
but he likes to think he is.

34:47.967 --> 34:49.268
I know.

34:49.268 --> 34:51.170
My mother's dead.

34:53.239 --> 34:55.641
I know that.

34:55.641 --> 34:58.011
That's all of them.
Take them away now.

34:58.012 --> 35:00.246
Do you know who my father is?

35:03.117 --> 35:04.550
Who?

35:04.551 --> 35:06.719
God.
He's everybody's father.

35:08.789 --> 35:10.490
Of course he is.

35:18.732 --> 35:20.066
Where will you go?

35:20.067 --> 35:22.135
Wherever they're
building cathedrals,

35:22.136 --> 35:24.037
I'll go to Jerusalem
if I have to.

35:24.038 --> 35:25.171
Philip is wrong.

35:25.172 --> 35:27.140
He will understand that
he made a mistake.

35:27.141 --> 35:30.009
Philip's stubborn, you push
against him and he pushes back.

35:30.010 --> 35:32.145
It would take witchcraft
to change his mind.

35:44.992 --> 35:46.793
Come in, Tom.

35:51.198 --> 35:53.066
What are you doing here?

35:53.067 --> 35:55.034
You saved my life, once.

35:55.035 --> 35:56.469
I know you're a man of mercy.

35:56.470 --> 35:58.504
How did you get inside?

35:58.505 --> 36:01.140
Not all of the brothers
fear me as you do.

36:01.141 --> 36:03.009
- Ma.
- Let me speak, Jack.

36:10.017 --> 36:11.617
I don't fear you.

36:11.618 --> 36:13.419
I oppose what you stand for,

36:13.420 --> 36:16.622
which is hatred of God,
and church and morality.

36:18.892 --> 36:20.393
I love God.

36:20.394 --> 36:23.830
Although I don't worship Her
quite the same way as you do.

36:23.831 --> 36:26.599
My church hasn't
as many rules as yours

36:26.600 --> 36:28.568
and is a lot more forgiving.

36:28.569 --> 36:31.170
And as for morality,
I use love as my compass,

36:31.171 --> 36:34.207
which Christ seemed
to approve of,

36:34.208 --> 36:35.808
even if you don't.

36:35.809 --> 36:37.310
Ma, you promised to be civil.

36:43.183 --> 36:45.318
Come in.
Close the door.

36:53.260 --> 36:56.696
I spend too much time making
decisions on the building.

36:56.697 --> 36:58.397
I need an assistant

36:58.398 --> 37:00.333
who can answer queries
on construction,

37:00.334 --> 37:02.869
who can keep track of
the money and raw materials,

37:02.870 --> 37:05.705
who can handle payments to
suppliers, who can pay wages.

37:05.706 --> 37:07.206
You wouldn't be carving stone,

37:07.207 --> 37:10.476
but you would be supervising
the entire design on my behalf.

37:10.477 --> 37:11.744
Really?

37:16.650 --> 37:17.984
Prior, that's fantastic.

37:17.985 --> 37:20.686
In your spare time,
if you had any,

37:20.687 --> 37:22.622
you'd learn speak
and read Latin.

37:22.623 --> 37:24.056
You'd serve me during Mass...

37:24.057 --> 37:26.192
Why would he need to do that?

37:26.193 --> 37:28.060
Because my assistant
must be a monk.

37:28.061 --> 37:29.795
Your church is not
having my son.

37:29.796 --> 37:32.198
That's Jack's
decision, not yours.

37:32.199 --> 37:33.466
It burned his father.

37:33.467 --> 37:35.501
It tried to burn me.
Ma!

37:37.838 --> 37:39.839
If I found the time,

37:40.941 --> 37:42.675
could I do some carving?

37:43.677 --> 37:46.078
Yes, of course.

37:46.079 --> 37:48.881
And I'll have free reign
to walk the grounds,

37:48.882 --> 37:50.249
speak with whomever I wish?

37:50.250 --> 37:52.485
You may speak to men,
on business, yes.

37:55.689 --> 37:57.657
God wants you, Jack.

37:57.658 --> 37:59.992
Of that I'm certain.

38:01.295 --> 38:03.229
He saved your life.

38:04.932 --> 38:06.599
He speaks to you
through your art

38:06.600 --> 38:09.502
as clearly as he spoke
to Augustine, Gregory,

38:09.503 --> 38:10.836
all His artist-saints.

38:10.837 --> 38:14.106
Do you want God?

38:17.911 --> 38:19.679
It's a simple choice...

38:20.747 --> 38:22.081
not an easy one.

38:56.350 --> 38:57.783
Rise.

39:21.375 --> 39:23.009
Put your hood on.

39:37.291 --> 39:39.625
Kingsbridge is planning
a fleece fair

39:39.626 --> 39:42.161
and Shiring shall become
a village of ghosts!

39:42.162 --> 39:43.763
Who told you this?

39:43.764 --> 39:47.033
Two of the Flemish traders who
normally do business with us.

39:47.034 --> 39:49.735
It's planned for
the last Sunday in June.

39:49.736 --> 39:51.504
That's 2 weeks from now.

39:51.505 --> 39:52.905
How can we stop it?

39:55.142 --> 39:58.411
That is a lovely stone.

40:01.982 --> 40:03.382
No.

40:03.383 --> 40:04.817
This belonged to my father.

40:04.818 --> 40:07.153
It's all I've got left of him.

40:07.154 --> 40:09.388
Queen Maud, as you well know,

40:09.389 --> 40:11.223
is fleeing back to France.

40:11.224 --> 40:13.959
Stephen thinks you are
both traitors.

40:13.960 --> 40:16.429
How else will I
convince him you're not?

40:16.430 --> 40:17.430
He loves a gift.

40:20.600 --> 40:23.536
Get him to stop the fair.

40:23.537 --> 40:26.639
Dear Lady, the fair
will begin, as planned,

40:26.640 --> 40:29.342
but it will not end as planned,

40:29.343 --> 40:31.377
will it, William?

40:37.818 --> 40:39.819
Don't be nervous, My Lord.

40:41.088 --> 40:43.022
Take your lesson

40:43.023 --> 40:45.991
Some take it as a work of art,

40:45.992 --> 40:47.760
a reason for living.

40:47.761 --> 40:52.231
Well, I say destruction
is a work of art...

40:54.034 --> 40:56.602
...and requires
significant talent.

40:58.972 --> 41:01.307
You have a gift, Lord William.

41:03.243 --> 41:05.578
Let's make your mother proud.

Ah, Kate!

Have you...

41:44.451 --> 41:46.152
Have you come to be shriven?

41:46.153 --> 41:48.921
Oh sweet Jesus!
I've prayed for this every day.

41:48.922 --> 41:52.191
I came to sell
my wares, Cuthbert.

41:52.192 --> 41:54.427
Any of your monks
interested in buying?

41:55.929 --> 41:58.197
Oh, that place.
In the shade.

41:58.198 --> 41:59.698
OK.
In the tree.

42:00.867 --> 42:02.935
Did I, uh...

42:02.936 --> 42:04.904
did I see Ellen here?

42:06.139 --> 42:08.207
Yes, she came to see her son.

42:09.242 --> 42:10.476
Not me.

42:10.477 --> 42:12.211
She's still angry with me

42:12.212 --> 42:14.447
for going along with your idea.

42:14.448 --> 42:17.450
She's a good woman, Prior.
You should accept her as she is.

42:17.451 --> 42:19.652
You're not gonna be able
to convert everyone.

42:19.653 --> 42:21.320
But I can bring her son to God.

42:21.321 --> 42:23.522
He's doing wonderful work.

42:23.523 --> 42:24.924
You should tell her that.

42:24.925 --> 42:28.427
If the Good Lord Himself came
down from heaven to praise him,

42:28.428 --> 42:30.696
I don't think that would
make her happy.

42:32.265 --> 42:34.300
40,000 sheep sold me
their winter coats.

42:34.301 --> 42:36.302
Would you believe it?

42:36.303 --> 42:37.770
It's cost me 200 pounds,

42:37.771 --> 42:39.305
but I'll make 3.

42:39.306 --> 42:42.041
Even I lose my breath
when I think about it.

42:42.042 --> 42:43.476
If you need help,

42:43.477 --> 42:46.545
I will gladly stick around
after I see Jack.

42:46.546 --> 42:49.114
Ellen, I know how hard
it must've been for you.

42:49.115 --> 42:52.451
I'm perfectly fine. It's Jack
you should worry about.

42:52.452 --> 42:54.420
He seems happy.

42:54.421 --> 42:57.623
Good. That's all
a mother asks for.

42:57.624 --> 42:59.325
What is?

43:00.627 --> 43:02.895
Oh I don't look that bad, do I?

43:02.896 --> 43:04.964
You've lost weight.
They're starving you.

43:04.965 --> 43:07.299
They feed me too well, Ma.

43:07.300 --> 43:08.467
You look exhausted.

43:08.468 --> 43:10.336
How many minutes of sleep

43:10.337 --> 43:11.904
do they allow you
between prayers?

43:11.905 --> 43:14.073
Oh I skip most of
the services, so...

43:14.074 --> 43:16.008
Do the monks try
to sleep with you?

43:16.009 --> 43:17.743
Ma...

43:17.744 --> 43:20.246
No, I have no interest
along those lines

43:20.247 --> 43:22.481
and even if I did,
it's forbidden.

43:22.482 --> 43:24.650
Do you have interest
along other lines?

43:24.651 --> 43:27.286
- What?
- Do you pleasure yourself?

43:27.287 --> 43:28.988
Ma!

43:28.989 --> 43:31.524
I... No!
I don't, no.

43:33.793 --> 43:35.528
That's unnatural.

43:40.734 --> 43:43.702
I want to make
a confession, Father.

43:43.703 --> 43:45.638
Mmm...

43:51.611 --> 43:53.145
You're Kate, aren't you?

43:53.146 --> 43:55.347
Brother Cuthbert's
little sister.

43:55.348 --> 43:56.515
I remember you well.

43:56.516 --> 43:57.716
What's it to you?

43:57.717 --> 43:59.318
You're everything to him.

43:59.319 --> 44:01.086
He prays for you daily.

44:01.087 --> 44:03.188
You are a knife in his heart.

44:05.859 --> 44:08.027
See the dogs spite the bear!

44:09.963 --> 44:12.031
I got... I got 6
on the brown dog.

44:12.032 --> 44:13.632
Who wants a piece of it?

44:20.407 --> 44:22.508
Winner takes the pot!

44:33.353 --> 44:35.521
What are they gonna
do with him?

44:36.556 --> 44:38.123
They're gonna fight him.

44:38.124 --> 44:40.359
Do they kill him?

44:40.360 --> 44:41.860
In the end, yeah.

44:41.861 --> 44:43.729
That's sad.

44:44.898 --> 44:46.465
Oh, not so much, not for him.

44:46.466 --> 44:49.435
He gets to die bravely,
fighting for what he longs for.

44:49.436 --> 44:50.669
What's that?

44:50.670 --> 44:52.037
Honor, really.

44:52.038 --> 44:53.739
And he gets to go
to bear heaven,

44:53.740 --> 44:56.342
wander around, eat as
much fish as he likes.

44:59.379 --> 45:01.680
Come with me.
I got a surprise for you.

45:12.525 --> 45:14.126
Up you climb, then.

45:14.127 --> 45:15.260
You really mean it?

45:15.261 --> 45:17.863
Go on, I'm right with you.

45:26.740 --> 45:28.007
That way.

45:30.877 --> 45:32.478
There you are.

45:32.479 --> 45:34.580
Don't get too close.

45:35.515 --> 45:37.116
I can see everywhere!

45:37.117 --> 45:39.351
I can see London.
And the ocean.

45:40.587 --> 45:42.588
I can see heaven!

45:43.790 --> 45:45.691
Hey, Jonathan...

45:45.692 --> 45:47.860
I mean, Brother Jonathan,
I'm sorry.

45:52.298 --> 45:54.600
There's something
I wanna tell you.

45:54.601 --> 45:56.902
I think I can see an angel.

45:56.903 --> 46:00.873
Listen to me. You know how
you and I are friends, yes?

46:00.874 --> 46:03.242
Well suppose I was to tell you

46:03.243 --> 46:05.110
we were something
closer than friends?

46:08.381 --> 46:10.315
And when Jack went away,

46:12.552 --> 46:15.254
for me that was sort of
like losing a son.

46:18.925 --> 46:20.492
But...

46:20.493 --> 46:22.194
What's that?

46:32.072 --> 46:33.338
Yah!

46:36.276 --> 46:40.512
Ellen, get inside the priory!
William Hamleigh's attacking!

46:41.981 --> 46:45.084
Get inside the priory!
William Hamleigh's attacking!

46:50.957 --> 46:52.558
We've got to get
away from here.

46:52.559 --> 46:54.059
I've got 6 pence on the...

46:54.060 --> 46:56.762
Never mind that now!
Get inside everyone!

47:05.872 --> 47:07.406
Run away!

47:26.526 --> 47:27.926
Everybody!

47:43.176 --> 47:44.676
No!

47:44.677 --> 47:45.778
Come, Aliena!

47:45.779 --> 47:47.246
We need to go.
I can't!

47:47.247 --> 47:48.213
No, it's all I have!

47:48.214 --> 47:49.181
Leave it, Aliena!

47:55.789 --> 47:57.322
Stay here.
Stay here, Aliena.

47:57.323 --> 47:59.391
Shut these doors.
These doors need shutting.

47:59.392 --> 48:00.459
You stay here!

48:00.460 --> 48:02.327
Stay!

48:15.875 --> 48:16.875
It's locked!

48:16.876 --> 48:18.010
Go to the cathedral.

48:18.011 --> 48:19.011
Follow me.

48:19.012 --> 48:20.479
Open the door!

48:23.683 --> 48:26.185
For the love
of God, let us in!

48:29.656 --> 48:31.557
Tell him
to get the keys!

48:36.462 --> 48:38.764
Remigius, what is it?
What's happening?

48:38.765 --> 48:41.834
Prior Philip,
there's a riot or something!

48:41.835 --> 48:43.502
Someone's attacking the fair!

48:43.503 --> 48:45.537
- Open! Let them in!
- Don't be a fool!

48:45.538 --> 48:47.840
Get out of my way! Out!

48:58.952 --> 49:01.220
Dear God!

49:01.221 --> 49:03.222
Dear God, why? Why?

49:04.290 --> 49:05.858
Let me through!
I can open it.

49:05.859 --> 49:06.859
It's locked!

49:06.860 --> 49:08.227
Ease back, let me through.

49:08.228 --> 49:10.863
Don't worry.
Don't worry, I can open it.

49:10.864 --> 49:13.031
Quickly, please.
Open it!

49:13.032 --> 49:14.967
Open it!

49:20.707 --> 49:22.641
Burn it! Come on!

49:31.484 --> 49:33.185
Burn everything.

49:36.122 --> 49:39.191
Burn the wool!
All of it!

49:45.265 --> 49:46.265
Aliena!

50:01.114 --> 50:03.715
Yah! Yah!

50:25.104 --> 50:26.471
Burn, witch.

50:28.474 --> 50:31.009
No! No! No!

50:31.010 --> 50:32.744
No! No!

50:35.548 --> 50:36.682
No!

50:40.486 --> 50:41.486
Aaah!

51:14.988 --> 51:16.088
Yah!

51:30.803 --> 51:32.170
Tom!

51:33.539 --> 51:35.079
Tom!

51:37.175 --> 51:38.576
Don't meddle, monk!

51:43.165 --> 51:44.916
It was all for nothing,
Tom Builder.

52:14.766 --> 52:16.715
Yah! Yah!
