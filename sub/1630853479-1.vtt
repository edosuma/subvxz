TOM: Let me tell you
about the Swift family.

00:03.003 --> 00:04.879
We're not nerds.
We're Black nerds.

00:04.921 --> 00:06.548
Oh, and billionaires

00:06.589 --> 00:09.092
with the fastest whips
that money can buy.

00:09.134 --> 00:10.176
And swag.

00:10.218 --> 00:12.929
That's me, and here's my family.

00:12.971 --> 00:14.931
My parents and my cousin Lino.

00:14.973 --> 00:16.933
We're not the Obamas,
we're not ballers.

00:16.975 --> 00:19.561
Nobody won a championship.
We're inventors.

00:19.602 --> 00:22.105
And for the past 80 years,
if it has an engine,

00:22.147 --> 00:24.107
me, my grandfather
or my dad are the ones

00:24.149 --> 00:26.317
who gave you the keys.

00:26.359 --> 00:28.862
And today,
we're going to Saturn.

I'll take your questions
about the launch.

00:59.809 --> 01:02.562
Mr. Swift, you stake the fate
of your company on this venture.

01:02.604 --> 01:03.897
Why now?

01:03.938 --> 01:05.815
Why Saturn?

01:05.857 --> 01:07.859
A successful mission to Saturn

01:07.901 --> 01:09.986
will usher in a new era

01:10.028 --> 01:13.448
of commercial space travel
for Swift Enterprises.

01:13.490 --> 01:14.574
Can your chief

01:14.616 --> 01:16.284
of special projects engineering

01:16.326 --> 01:17.827
tell us about the ship?

01:17.869 --> 01:19.913
You mean my son, Tom.

01:21.623 --> 01:24.626
Tom... I...

01:24.667 --> 01:26.127
Tom...

01:26.169 --> 01:27.462
I'm Claire Cormier,
SVP of Special Projects.

01:27.504 --> 01:29.089
I'll take the question.

01:29.130 --> 01:30.548
You're asking
about the ship.

01:30.590 --> 01:32.717
As with everything
with Swift Enterprises...

01:34.761 --> 01:36.638
My word, Zenzi! Zenzi!

01:36.679 --> 01:39.099
Oh!
Hi. When did you get in?

01:39.140 --> 01:40.725
Two hours ago.
Oh.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.560
Not a bag,
not a wrinkle.
Ugh.

01:42.602 --> 01:45.313
Uh! I need your nighttime
routine immediately.

01:45.355 --> 01:46.689
I will tell you later,
Aunt Lorraine.

01:46.731 --> 01:48.691
They need Tom
at the press conference.

01:48.733 --> 01:51.653
TOM (on video):
We're not the Obamas,
we're not ballers...

01:51.694 --> 01:53.363
Lino, do you know where Tom is?

01:53.404 --> 01:55.198
Your uncle's press conference
already started, and...

01:55.240 --> 01:56.991
What are you doing?

01:57.033 --> 01:59.994
Tom and I built these jump shoes
to help me with my vertical.

02:00.036 --> 02:02.789
They're not finished,
but I'm not waiting.

02:02.831 --> 02:04.958
Oh, there's Isaac.
He must be on his way to Tom.

02:04.999 --> 02:06.376
Don't walk away!

02:06.417 --> 02:08.336
Goodbye, Lino. Isaac?

02:08.378 --> 02:10.421
Isaac? Tom is late

press event that we've...

02:25.061 --> 02:27.147
Tom, you're late!

02:36.197 --> 02:37.866
It's done.

02:37.907 --> 02:39.659
Barclay,
start the propulsion system.

02:39.701 --> 02:41.369
BARCLAY:
Outstanding.
Your best friend is here.

02:41.411 --> 02:42.537
Hi, Zenzi.

02:42.579 --> 02:44.330
Hi, Barclay.
How's my favorite AI?

02:44.372 --> 02:45.957
I'm well.

02:45.999 --> 02:49.252
Ooh, I'm impressed.

02:49.294 --> 02:51.087
You spent a full year
playing house in Atlanta

02:51.129 --> 02:53.089
and didn't get thick.

02:53.131 --> 02:55.425
You know the press conference
started ten minutes ago.

02:55.466 --> 02:57.135
Come on.
They're looking for you.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.887
You know this
is unnecessary.

02:58.928 --> 03:00.680
You're safer when you're alert.

03:00.722 --> 03:03.683
I'll make sure the transport for
the propulsion system is secure.

03:03.725 --> 03:06.519
Maybe I can just hire a man
to treat me

03:06.561 --> 03:08.146
as good
as your bodyguard treats you.

03:09.439 --> 03:11.941
Barclay, search for candidates
for Zenzi's new man.

03:11.983 --> 03:14.319
Do not search, Barclay.

03:14.360 --> 03:16.321
We have to go.

BARTON:

03:18.865 --> 03:20.909
Uncle Barton.

03:20.950 --> 03:22.452
Zenzi.

03:22.493 --> 03:24.287
Welcome home.
(Zenzi laughs)

03:24.329 --> 03:25.288
Thank you.
(Barton laughs)

03:25.330 --> 03:26.789
I heard great things

03:26.831 --> 03:28.875
about your work
for us in Atlanta.
Well...

03:28.917 --> 03:30.710
Well. (laughs)

03:30.752 --> 03:32.587
Would you excuse us?

03:32.629 --> 03:35.006
Um...

03:36.341 --> 03:38.384
Sure.
Thanks.

03:42.722 --> 03:45.516
You pulled the propulsion system
without notifying me?

03:45.558 --> 03:47.518
I upped the reaction rate
to make sure

03:47.560 --> 03:49.896
you get to Saturn and back
in one year's time.

03:49.938 --> 03:51.773
It's ready
for Mission Control now.

03:51.814 --> 03:54.901
Boy, have you lost
your damn mind?

03:54.943 --> 03:57.654
While I'm gone,
you need to grow up.

03:57.695 --> 03:59.614
Be a man.

03:59.656 --> 04:02.825
A man meets his deadlines.

04:02.867 --> 04:06.120
A man doesn't prance around
half naked

04:06.162 --> 04:07.622
and wear pants that are

04:07.664 --> 04:09.207
vacuum-sealed to his ass.
Got it.

04:09.249 --> 04:13.002
Be a man. Will do.
You look at me

04:13.044 --> 04:14.879
while I'm speaking to you,

04:14.921 --> 04:16.839
and you watch your tone.

04:17.882 --> 04:21.427
You will have more
responsibility heaped upon you

04:21.469 --> 04:24.097
than you even know.

04:28.017 --> 04:30.103
You're just not ready yet.

04:31.020 --> 04:33.189
And your sensitivity...

04:34.774 --> 04:36.985
...is why I'm making
Claire interim CEO

04:37.026 --> 04:38.987
instead of you.

04:39.028 --> 04:41.030
What?

04:41.072 --> 04:43.825
I'm the one who
found a meteorite

04:43.866 --> 04:45.243
and turned it
into the fuel

04:45.285 --> 04:47.245
that will get you
to outer space.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.998
My sensitive ass and
tailored pants are the reason

04:50.039 --> 04:51.916
you can even go
on this journey at all.

04:51.958 --> 04:53.418
And my last name is the reason

04:53.459 --> 04:54.711
why you have an observatory
to play with.

04:54.752 --> 04:57.005
You can learn a lot

04:57.046 --> 04:59.632
from how Claire runs the company
while I'm away.

04:59.674 --> 05:01.134
I taught her everything
she knows.

05:04.554 --> 05:06.514
Well, if being CEO means

05:06.556 --> 05:08.641
being like
you and Claire,

05:08.683 --> 05:10.393
then I'm good.

05:13.354 --> 05:15.982
Well, if you feel that way,
then...

05:16.024 --> 05:18.735
there's no reason

11:38.114 --> 11:41.367

the streamers on the handlebars.

11:41.409 --> 11:45.246

to slow down, or I'd crash.

11:47.873 --> 11:50.000
And one day, I did.

11:51.127 --> 11:55.005
And when your father
found me in the bushes

11:55.047 --> 11:57.967
with my knees all scraped up,

11:58.008 --> 12:00.010
he didn't yell.

12:00.928 --> 12:03.431
BARTON:
You're just not ready yet.

12:03.472 --> 12:07.560

I'm making Claire...

12:07.601 --> 12:09.019
ZENZI:
He walked me back

12:09.061 --> 12:11.188

how to ride faster...

12:11.230 --> 12:13.816
(laughs) ...safely.

12:17.153 --> 12:20.573

Uncle Barton.

something else.

Tom disappointed you.

12:52.688 --> 12:55.483
Oh, that's not fair.

12:55.524 --> 12:58.110
His father just died.
He's grieving.

12:59.445 --> 13:00.613
And he's in pain.

13:00.654 --> 13:02.740
No. I understand that, but

13:02.782 --> 13:06.035

he may not be ready

13:06.076 --> 13:08.996

social group requires.

13:09.038 --> 13:11.874

for The Mountaintop.

13:14.794 --> 13:17.046
Where is Tom, anyway?

13:19.757 --> 13:22.343
TOM:
My sensitive ass
and tailored pants

13:22.384 --> 13:24.470
are the reason you can even
go on this journey at all.

you wanted.

14:30.828 --> 14:35.374
TL;DR, but the explosion
started outside the ship's hull.

14:36.417 --> 14:37.918
Then it wasn't my fault.

14:37.960 --> 14:39.503
My propulsion system
didn't fail.

14:39.545 --> 14:41.088

its early flight plan.

14:58.105 --> 15:00.441

15:00.482 --> 15:01.817

and you're gonna get it...

15:19.460 --> 15:21.295

15:21.337 --> 15:23.839
Okay, bodyguard.

15:28.594 --> 15:30.596

Mm.

15:39.980 --> 15:41.941
Got a prospective client
for you.

15:41.982 --> 15:43.609
Ward Chemicals.

15:43.651 --> 15:45.819
They're requesting that
you engineer a good soap.

15:45.861 --> 15:47.446
Oh, like,

Yeah.

15:47.488 --> 15:49.823
No. We build clean energy
systems and navigation tech.

15:49.865 --> 15:51.450
If they want soap,
they can go to the corner store.

15:51.492 --> 15:53.452
Listen, those clients
are a lifeline.

15:53.494 --> 15:56.038

assets on a project that...

16:01.794 --> 16:04.546

16:10.052 --> 16:12.137
Meanwhile, Claire

16:12.179 --> 16:15.724
wants to make her interim
CEO position a forever thing.

16:15.766 --> 16:17.685
She is trying
to steal your company.

16:17.726 --> 16:19.812
You are watching

16:19.853 --> 16:22.147
The board will name a permanent
CEO at the end of the year,

16:22.189 --> 16:23.607
and it could still be you

16:23.649 --> 16:26.026

stop punishing yourself.

to Justin at the repast?

17:00.686 --> 17:02.896

17:02.938 --> 17:04.940

17:04.982 --> 17:06.900

classified satellite data?

17:54.156 --> 17:56.366
Yes, but not

27:32.067 --> 27:34.027
I put everything on the line
for you tonight while

27:34.069 --> 27:36.946
all you've done is embarrass me
with Ward Chemicals.

27:36.988 --> 27:38.531
No. You're asking me to do soap
in the middle of all this?

27:38.573 --> 27:40.533
I am telling you that
while you're on your quest

27:40.575 --> 27:42.535
for justice, people's lives
are on the line,

27:42.577 --> 27:44.579
but you're too selfish
to see that.

27:44.621 --> 27:45.997
Excuse me?
Your father

27:46.039 --> 27:48.208
never would have
blown off this project.

27:48.249 --> 27:50.460
Your father would have made
sure his thousands of employees

27:50.502 --> 27:52.212
kept their jobs.
Yeah. Uh, uh...

27:52.253 --> 27:54.381
And that's why your dad
chose Claire to be CEO

27:54.422 --> 27:58.551
and not you,
because you are a spoiled brat

27:58.593 --> 28:00.637
who would rather play fix-it
with his stupid toys

28:00.679 --> 28:02.681
than to lift a finger
to help anyone else.

28:02.722 --> 28:04.724
You're right.

28:04.766 --> 28:07.394
I don't stop trying
to fix things,

28:07.435 --> 28:09.396
because I will never fix me.

28:11.022 --> 28:12.691
Uncle Barton loved you.
No, no, no, no, no.

28:12.732 --> 28:15.402
He never would have said
otherwise

28:15.443 --> 28:17.445
because it wouldn't be
socially acceptable

28:17.487 --> 28:21.116
for him to admit that he was
embarrassed to have a gay son.

28:21.157 --> 28:24.411
So I will never be the man
my father wanted me to be.

28:25.787 --> 28:27.956
Now he's dead.

28:33.128 --> 28:35.547
BARCLAY: I've analyzed all the
data you stole from the SCIF,

28:35.588 --> 28:37.841
and I found
something interesting.

28:37.882 --> 28:40.093
When your dad's ship left
Earth's thermosphere,

28:40.135 --> 28:41.302
it passed right by a satellite

28:41.344 --> 28:43.304
that took a shot at him.
"Shot"?

28:43.346 --> 28:45.014
C-Can you show me

28:45.056 --> 28:46.975
what you compiled
from those satellite images?

28:49.561 --> 28:51.229
Whatever they shot
at Barton's ship,

28:51.271 --> 28:52.856
it was very sticky.

28:52.897 --> 28:55.316
And then, six months later...

28:58.862 --> 29:00.363
It killed my dad.

29:00.405 --> 29:02.699
Which satellite fired
the projectile?

29:02.741 --> 29:05.368
I couldn't find any info on it.
Okay.

29:05.410 --> 29:07.787
Go through your visual memory
cache in the past two weeks.

29:07.829 --> 29:09.539
Have we seen
that symbol anywhere?

29:09.581 --> 29:11.541
Is it in any graphic database
online?

29:11.583 --> 29:13.126
I need to give you a tune-up.

29:13.168 --> 29:14.711
You're skipping.

29:15.754 --> 29:17.672
Found it
in the selfie-photo steam.

29:17.714 --> 29:19.966
Phone should be ringing,
'cause you called it.

29:20.008 --> 29:22.469

29:22.510 --> 29:24.888
"You up?"
(phone whooshes)

29:25.847 --> 29:28.808

29:32.645 --> 29:34.647

29:37.609 --> 29:38.693
Sent.

29:38.735 --> 29:40.487

29:40.528 --> 29:42.489
that you didn't text
a selfie back.

29:42.530 --> 29:44.157
How do you know
he's disappointed?

29:44.199 --> 29:46.159
The dots go slower
when he types.

29:46.201 --> 29:48.161
Sad boys type slow.

29:48.203 --> 29:49.496

30:22.862 --> 30:24.531
Stone Corporation--
Okay, could he have tried

30:24.572 --> 30:25.990
to call it something
less evil?

30:26.032 --> 30:27.325
They're rumored

30:28.868 --> 30:30.370
called The Road Back.

30:32.789 --> 30:35.208

The Road Back wants to prevent

of humanity.

the dedication.

31:19.043 --> 31:20.628
But I've been trying--

31:20.670 --> 31:22.630
Reverend Jones said your
absence proved you're not ready

one other thing.

37:35.002 --> 37:37.672
I want you to know...
(static crackling)

37:37.713 --> 37:40.091
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.

37:40.132 --> 37:42.218
Recover the rest
of that message!

37:42.260 --> 37:44.178
BARCLAY:
I can't. It's gone.

37:44.220 --> 37:47.181
But the capsule is on its way
through the atmosphere.

37:48.182 --> 37:50.893
Call Zenzi.
We're going for a ride.

37:57.316 --> 37:59.443
BARCLAY: Barton's message
capsule is headed for splashdown

37:59.485 --> 38:00.861
in the Hudson River,
12 miles away.

38:00.903 --> 38:02.488
You got this, Tom.

38:06.033 --> 38:07.994
Now you've got a vantage point

38:08.035 --> 38:10.121
on the landing spot
that I projected.

38:10.162 --> 38:13.249
The capsule should be
incoming shortly.

38:13.291 --> 38:15.167
So your dad's alive.

38:15.209 --> 38:16.669
He sent you a capsule.

38:16.711 --> 38:19.797
And Eskol is very bad?

38:19.839 --> 38:22.008
Hmm, yeah, well,
I guess all the good ones

38:22.049 --> 38:25.469
are married, gay
or criminal masterminds.

38:28.055 --> 38:29.348
Thanks for looping us in.

38:29.390 --> 38:32.435
I know I was harsh...
on you.

38:33.853 --> 38:35.521
And I was a dick.

38:35.563 --> 38:36.981
(laughs)
Yeah.

38:37.023 --> 38:39.025
Sometimes I forget
that I don't...

38:39.066 --> 38:40.901
I don't do anything alone.

38:40.943 --> 38:42.653
Mm.

38:42.695 --> 38:44.989
And it's not "the Zenzi show."

38:46.282 --> 38:49.118
It's that I can't do this
without you.

38:50.786 --> 38:54.373
Is that self-awareness
and humility from the Tom Swift?

38:54.415 --> 38:56.042
Are you sure
we're looking for a capsule

38:56.083 --> 38:57.668
and not a flying pig?
Okay.

38:57.710 --> 38:59.295
ISAAC:
Glad you worked it out.

38:59.337 --> 39:02.757
But now I suggest we call
NASA and ask them for help.

39:02.798 --> 39:04.717
We don't know if NASA has been
infiltrated by The Road Back.

39:04.759 --> 39:06.385
And Uncle Barton
will ration

39:06.427 --> 39:08.429
his supplies
until we find him.

39:08.471 --> 39:10.181
Uncle Barton climbed
Everest with no oxygen

39:10.222 --> 39:13.059
and a broken foot.
Saturn is light work.

39:13.100 --> 39:14.643
BARCLAY:
Uh-oh.

39:14.685 --> 39:17.563
The capsule's signal
just broke up into pieces.

39:17.605 --> 39:19.523
TOM:
It must have shattered
upon re-entry.

39:19.565 --> 39:22.068
Fragments are spreading
out as we speak.

39:22.109 --> 39:25.154
Closest one is now headed
for the South, maybe Georgia.

39:25.196 --> 39:26.739
Others will drop down
in Oklahoma,

39:26.781 --> 39:29.325
Utah, California.

39:29.367 --> 39:31.077
The message got
destroyed?

39:31.118 --> 39:32.495
TOM:
Wait.

39:32.536 --> 39:34.747
Not destroyed.

39:34.789 --> 39:36.749
Disassembled.

39:36.791 --> 39:38.834
Each piece
should survive re-entry.

39:38.876 --> 39:40.586
Those fragments are scattering
across the entire country.

39:40.628 --> 39:42.755
Oh, no, if only
we had the resources

39:42.797 --> 39:44.548
to go out and find them.
Barclay,

39:44.590 --> 39:46.967
track the pieces of the capsule
as they fall to Earth.

39:47.009 --> 39:48.302
BARCLAY:
Tracking now.

39:49.428 --> 39:51.305
I've been wanting
to take a road trip.

39:51.347 --> 39:53.474
Zenzi, Isaac,
pack your bags.

39:53.516 --> 39:55.601
Wheels up in an hour.
Gonna find the capsule pieces,

39:55.643 --> 39:57.603
and reassemble the message
that my father sent.

39:57.645 --> 39:58.771
Come on.

39:58.813 --> 40:00.773
That's how we'll rescue him.

40:00.815 --> 40:03.275
We can't let anyone know
what we're doing.

40:03.317 --> 40:05.069
We can only trust each other.

40:13.953 --> 40:15.913
Isaac...

40:15.955 --> 40:18.666
I owe you an apology.

40:18.707 --> 40:21.794
I know I can be
a touch self-absorbed,

40:21.836 --> 40:24.296
but Zenzi read me down,

40:24.338 --> 40:27.216
and... I'm so glad

40:27.258 --> 40:29.218
you're in my life.
(chuckles softly)

40:29.260 --> 40:31.679
I can't do this without you.

40:33.514 --> 40:35.599
Also, your refusal to wear

40:35.641 --> 40:37.893
anything other than black
is enraging.

40:37.935 --> 40:39.770
So...
(laughs)
(laughs)

40:39.812 --> 40:41.439
I have a slightly
more stylish

40:41.480 --> 40:43.649
monochrome fit waiting
for you on the jet.

40:43.691 --> 40:46.360
32 waist, right?

40:46.402 --> 40:48.320
Thank you.

40:57.204 --> 40:59.165
Look, I'll be home
as quick as I can.

40:59.206 --> 41:00.833
And you let me know if that
Claire person is with Mom.

41:00.875 --> 41:02.251
Yeah.

41:06.172 --> 41:08.174
Let us not depart in silence.

41:08.215 --> 41:10.926
BARCLAY: How about this one?

Barclay, he calls it?

through the AI's

41:43.292 --> 41:45.461
we'll have

I can count on you all to

keep Tom Swift
from discovering our plans?

ALL:
Yes, sir.
