OH, DADDY, I PROMISE
WE'LL TALK LATER, OKAY,

BECAUSE I JUST HAVE TO FINISH
UNLOADING THESE GROCERIES,

03:37.445 --> 03:38.944
AND THEN I HAVE TO GET
YOUR DINNER READY.

03:39.046 --> 03:39.878

03:47.755 --> 03:49.321
WAY TOO MUCH TIME
WORRYING ABOUT ME,

03:49.423 --> 03:51.757
INSTEAD OF CONCENTRATING
ON YOURSELF.

SO THAT YOU COULD GO OUT
ON A DATE SOMETIME.

04:05.072 --> 04:07.839
OOH, I'M NOT GONNA DISCUSS
DATING WITH MY DAD.

04:07.941 --> 04:10.809
WELL, JUST REMEMBER
WHAT I SAID.

04:10.911 --> 04:11.843
FOR ME, OKAY?

04:13.681 --> 04:16.281
BECAUSE LIFE CAN JUST BEAD
YOU BY, KATIE.

04:16.384 --> 04:17.849
ALL WITHOUT YOU
EVEN REALIZING IT.

04:17.951 --> 04:19.084
OKAY, DADDY.

04:19.187 --> 04:20.685
I KNOW YOU ALWAYS WANTED
TO TEACH...

04:22.423 --> 04:23.455
AND HAVE A FAMILY.

04:23.558 --> 04:25.691
I JUST WANT
TO MAKE SURE

04:25.793 --> 04:28.694
THAT YOU REMEMBER YOUR DREAMS
AS WELL AS I REMEMBER THEM.

04:28.796 --> 04:30.496
- <i>OKAY?</i>
- OKAY.

04:30.598 --> 04:32.464

04:33.568 --> 04:35.301
OKAY. GOOD.

04:35.403 --> 04:37.035
FOR NOW.

04:37.137 --> 04:38.070
[coughs]

04:39.907 --> 04:41.407
GOOD TALK.
THAT WAS A GOOD TALK.

04:41.509 --> 04:42.408
DADDY?

04:44.111 --> 04:45.277
YOU KNOW
I'M GONNA COME TACKLE YOU

04:45.379 --> 04:46.378
AND TAKE THAT CANDY BACK,
RIGHT?

04:46.480 --> 04:48.614
I LOVE YOU
BIG AS THE SKY, KATIE.

04:49.783 --> 04:51.183

I'M GONNA KEEP THESE.

<i>THOUGH IT'S HARD
TO BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE.</i>

05:10.304 --> 05:11.136
<i>SO IT'S GONNA TAKE ME</i>

05:11.239 --> 05:12.404
A FEW DAYS
TO FIND SOMEBODY NEW.

05:12.506 --> 05:15.574
BUT WHEN I DO, I'M GOING
TO ENTRUST IN BOTH OF YOU

05:15.676 --> 05:17.276
THAT YOU'RE NOT GONNA PLOT,
PLAN, OR STRATEGIZE

05:17.378 --> 05:19.378
<i>THE DEMISE OF ANOTHER NANNY,

05:23.016 --> 05:24.216

05:40.301 --> 05:41.199
AND I KNOW
IT'S ESPECIALLY HARD ON YOU

11:13.467 --> 11:15.500
WHEN WOULD YOU LIKE ME
TO START?

11:15.603 --> 11:16.434
IS TOMORROW TOO SOON?

11:16.536 --> 11:17.903
THAT'S PERFECT.

11:18.005 --> 11:19.337
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

11:19.439 --> 11:20.939
[sighs]
THANK YOU.

11:21.041 --> 11:22.841
[laughs]

11:25.145 --> 11:26.979
<i>(David)
OH, YEAH.</i>

11:29.116 --> 11:30.381
IT'S JUST THE THREE OF US.

11:30.484 --> 11:31.382
SO.

11:32.953 --> 11:34.252
SEE YOU TOMORROW.
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

11:36.523 --> 11:37.355
(Jerry)
DID YOU GET THE JOB?

11:37.457 --> 11:38.957
I DID GET THE JOB.

11:39.059 --> 11:40.225
[laughs]

11:40.327 --> 11:41.593
WOW.

11:41.695 --> 11:42.728
I THINK IT'S GONNA BE
A GOOD ONE TOO.

11:42.830 --> 11:44.195
OH, THAT'S TERRIFIC.

11:44.297 --> 11:46.064
DADDY, YOU SHOULD SEE
THIS HOUSE.

11:46.166 --> 11:47.465
OH, MY GOD.

11:47.567 --> 11:51.302
IT'S BIGGER
THAN THIS WHOLE COMPLEX.

11:51.404 --> 11:52.303
- IT IS, IS IT?
- YEAH.

11:52.405 --> 11:53.404
OH, WOW.

11:53.507 --> 11:54.873
NOW I'M GONNA LET YOU SLEEP,
OKAY?

11:58.578 --> 12:00.378
I'M SO PROUD OF YOU,
KATIE.

12:01.682 --> 12:03.414
I LOVE YOU
BIG AS THE SKY.

12:03.517 --> 12:04.750
I LOVE YOU TOO, DADDY.

12:05.919 --> 12:06.852
GOOD NIGHT.

12:22.402 --> 12:24.435
WHAT IS THAT SMELL?

12:24.538 --> 12:25.570
UH, IT'S YOUR DINNER.

12:27.808 --> 12:28.874
<i>(Emily)
I HAVE PLANS</i>

12:28.976 --> 12:30.075
TO GO STUDY
AT A FRIEND'S HOUSE TONIGHT,

12:30.177 --> 12:32.144
SO I'LL JUST GRAB SOMETHING
OVER THERE.

12:32.245 --> 12:33.311
OH, YOUR DAD SAID
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED

12:33.413 --> 12:34.546
TO GO OUT ON SCHOOL NIGHTS.

12:34.648 --> 12:36.181
<i>YOU GUYS WANNA DO
YOUR HOMEWORK AT THE TABLE?</i>

12:36.283 --> 12:37.883
DINNER'S ALMOST READY.

12:37.985 --> 12:39.384
I'LL DO MINE UPSTAIRS.

12:39.486 --> 12:40.786
I CANNOT CONCENTRATE
WITH THAT REEK.

12:43.023 --> 12:43.989
HOW'S IT GOING?

12:46.326 --> 12:47.993
I'VE NEVER DONE MY HOMEWORK
IN THE KITCHEN BEFORE.

12:48.095 --> 12:49.094
YOU'RE KIDDING.

12:49.196 --> 12:50.428
<i>I ALWAYS DID MY HOMEWORK</i>

12:50.530 --> 12:51.697
<i>IN THE KITCHEN
WHEN I WAS A KID.</i>

12:51.799 --> 12:52.864
MY MOM ALWAYS SAID
IT WAS THE BEST PLACE TO DO IT.

12:52.966 --> 12:53.865
YOU KNOW WHY?

12:55.535 --> 12:58.036
<i>BECAUSE YOU CAN'T STARE
AT THE TV,</i>

12:58.138 --> 13:01.539
YOU'RE NEAR THE SNACKS,
WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT.

13:01.641 --> 13:03.341
BEST PART IS, IF YOU NEED
MY HELP, I'M RIGHT HERE.

13:05.579 --> 13:07.445
I BET YOUR MOM WOULD THINK
IT'S A GOOD IDEA TOO.

13:07.547 --> 13:09.514
WELL, SINCE WE DON'T HAVE
A MOM,

13:09.616 --> 13:12.150
I'D SAY
THAT'S A PRETTY STUPID IDEA.

13:12.252 --> 13:14.052
COME ON, BEN, I'LL HELP YOU
WITH YOUR HOMEWORK UPSTAIRS.

13:31.304 --> 13:33.504
OH, LOOK,
IT WAS YOUR FIRST DAY.

13:33.607 --> 13:34.940
OF COURSE YOU SAID THINGS
THAT YOU WISH YOU HADN'T.

13:35.042 --> 13:36.441
YEAH.

13:36.543 --> 13:37.442
IT'LL GO SO MUCH BETTER
TOMORROW.

13:37.544 --> 13:38.910
RIGHT.

13:39.012 --> 13:40.545
IT'LL BE FINE.

13:40.647 --> 13:41.780
HEY, KATIE,
THAT'S THE SPIRIT, TIGER.

13:43.083 --> 13:44.950
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

13:52.459 --> 13:53.424
I ALWAYS TRY
TO KEEP IT POSITIVE,

13:53.526 --> 13:54.726
NO MATTER WHAT THE SITUATION
MIGHT LOOK LIKE.

13:54.828 --> 13:55.927
YEAH.

13:56.029 --> 13:57.095
YOU NEVER KNOW
WHEN SOMEONE'S GONNA CHANGE

13:57.197 --> 13:58.830
<i>THEIR MIND
ABOUT YOU.</i>

14:00.533 --> 14:02.533
WELL, OH, UH,
THANKS FOR THAT, RAY.

14:02.636 --> 14:04.669
THAT'S REALLY GOOD ADVICE.

14:06.706 --> 14:08.173
GO OUT WITH HIM.

14:08.275 --> 14:09.241
I WILL THINK
ABOUT IT.

14:09.342 --> 14:10.475
HEY, RAY,

14:10.577 --> 14:12.077
<i>YOU KNOW WHAT,
I THINK YOU MIGHT BE RIGHT.</i>

14:12.179 --> 14:13.745
YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE,
EMILY AND BEN,

14:13.847 --> 14:15.280
THEY PROBABLY JUST NEED A LITTLE
BIT OF TIME TO GET USED TO ME.

14:15.382 --> 14:16.481
<i>IT'S GONNA BE FINE.</i>

14:16.583 --> 14:18.283
IT CAN'T GET
ANY WORSE, RIGHT?

14:18.385 --> 14:20.051
RIGHT.

14:20.154 --> 14:22.020
RIGHT.

14:27.961 --> 14:29.494
EMILY.
WHAT?

14:29.596 --> 14:31.163
YOU HAVE LAUNDRY?
NO.

14:31.265 --> 14:32.931
NOTHING.
JUST THE MAID.

14:36.336 --> 14:37.435
[laughs]

14:39.139 --> 14:40.505
HEY, THERE YOU ARE.

14:40.607 --> 14:41.907
HEY, WHAT'S HAPPENING?

14:42.009 --> 14:43.809
NOTHING MUCH.

14:43.911 --> 14:45.310
HOW'S YOUR HOMEWORK GOING?

14:45.412 --> 14:46.278
I'M ALMOST FINISHED.

14:46.379 --> 14:47.578
OH, GOOD.

14:47.681 --> 14:49.014
HEY, CAN I HELP YOU
WITH THE LAUNDRY?

14:49.116 --> 14:50.816
SURE. YEAH.
YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO?

14:50.918 --> 14:51.817
OH, YEAH.

14:51.919 --> 14:53.151
I'VE DONE IT
MORE THAN A COUPLE TIMES.

14:53.253 --> 14:54.619
[phone ringing]

14:54.721 --> 14:58.089
I'LL GET THAT.

14:58.192 --> 14:59.791

15:04.131 --> 15:05.063

YEAH, WE JUST--
WE HAD A MINOR MISHAP

16:57.777 --> 16:58.944
IN THE LAUNDRY ROOM.

16:59.046 --> 17:01.313
HEY, KATE,
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE OFF?

17:01.415 --> 17:03.848
- GREAT.

UM...SORRY,

17:17.630 --> 17:18.930
<i>I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT YOU
TO LEAVE,</i>

17:19.031 --> 17:20.698
BUT, YOU KNOW,
UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES,

17:20.800 --> 17:22.233
YOU MIGHT WANT TO GO HOME

17:22.336 --> 17:23.300
<i>AND DRY OFF.</i>

17:23.403 --> 17:25.002
OKAY, GREAT. BYE.

17:26.739 --> 17:29.941
KATE?

17:43.523 --> 17:44.622
(Jerry) DID THOSE
KIDS MAKE AN EFFORT

17:44.724 --> 17:45.590
TO GET TO KNOW YOU
TODAY?

17:45.692 --> 17:47.659
OH, YEAH.

17:47.761 --> 17:49.661
THEY MADE A HUGE EFFORT
TO GET TO KNOW ME.

17:49.763 --> 17:51.495
IN FACT, BEN OFFERED
TO HELP ME WITH THE LAUNDRY.

17:51.598 --> 17:53.598
WHY DON'T I FEEL
THAT WAS A GOOD THING?

17:53.700 --> 17:55.633
WELL, BECAUSE IF YOU CONSIDER ME
HAVING TO CLEAN UP

17:55.735 --> 17:57.501
FOUR INCHES OF SOAP SUDS
OFF THE FLOOR

17:57.604 --> 17:59.136
BEFORE DAVID GOT HOME
A GOOD THING,

17:59.238 --> 18:00.438
THEN THAT COULD BE WHY.

18:00.540 --> 18:02.006
[chuckles]

18:02.108 --> 18:03.541
THAT'S NOT FUNNY,
DADDY.

18:03.643 --> 18:04.609
YEAH, IT IS A LITTLE BIT.

18:04.711 --> 18:06.544
IT IS A LITTLE FUNNY.

18:06.646 --> 18:08.112
THESE KIDS ARE TESTING
THE WATERS.

18:08.214 --> 18:10.448
THE SOAPY WATERS.

18:10.550 --> 18:13.718
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN ME
WHEN DAVID GOT HOME.

18:13.820 --> 18:14.886
SOAP IN MY HAIR.

18:14.988 --> 18:16.788
<i>SO MUCH FOR MAKING</i>

OH, DEFINITELY NOT.

20:06.866 --> 20:09.433
MAYBE.
MAYBE.

20:09.535 --> 20:11.435
PUT IT IN THE "MAYBE NOW,
IN A PINCH POSSIBLY" FILE.

20:11.537 --> 20:13.637
- HI, DAVID.
- HEY.

20:13.740 --> 20:15.139
<i>OH, CERTAINLY NOT.</i>

UGH.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

20:17.010 --> 20:17.942
CAPITAL N PERIOD O PERIOD.

20:18.044 --> 20:19.510
A BURGER?

20:19.612 --> 20:20.945
HEY.

20:21.047 --> 20:22.780
I HOPE THAT'S
FOR THE FRANKLIN MEETING.

20:22.882 --> 20:26.550
CAN I ASK YOU, WOULD YOU, UH,
POSSIBLY ENTERTAIN THE IDEA

20:26.652 --> 20:29.153
OF GOING ON A BLIND DATE
WITH ME?

20:29.255 --> 20:32.123
AND NOT JUST ME, I MEAN,
BUT THE LOVELYLADIES.COM.

20:32.225 --> 20:33.825
NO, I'M NOT GOING
ON A BLIND DATE WITH YOU.

20:33.927 --> 20:35.259
NOW FOCUS.
ON 20 MINUTES, WE'VE GOT

20:35.361 --> 20:36.360
A CONFERENCE CALL WITH THOSE
YAHOOS FROM THE RESTAURANT.

20:36.462 --> 20:37.929
IS THIS GOING TO A BALL GAME?
WHAT IS THIS?

20:38.031 --> 20:38.930
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
IT'S LUNCH.

20:39.032 --> 20:40.397
- LUNCH?
- YEAH.

20:40.499 --> 20:42.967
LIKE-- OH, THIS IS
THE NEW NANNY LUNCH, HUH?

20:43.069 --> 20:44.268
IT'S THE NEW NANNY LUNCH,
OKAY.

20:44.370 --> 20:45.436
IT'S A FEW LEFTOVERS
FROM DINNER LAST NIGHT.

20:45.538 --> 20:46.537
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

20:46.639 --> 20:47.504
IT'S JUST LUNCH.

20:47.607 --> 20:49.506
THERE'S LIKE FIVE COURSES
IN HERE.

20:49.609 --> 20:50.775
AND HOMEMADE COOKIES.
YEAH, AND YOU CAN'T HAVE 'EM.

20:50.877 --> 20:51.876
I WANT A NANNY.

20:51.978 --> 20:53.945
[laughs] YOU NEED
MORE THAN A NANNY.

21:02.021 --> 21:03.921
ALL RIGHT.

21:10.296 --> 21:11.996
THANK YOU.

21:12.098 --> 21:14.598
HMM.

HEY, LOUIE.

21:48.268 --> 21:50.134
(Reverend) NO,
IT'S REALLY VERY SIMPLE.

21:50.236 --> 21:54.371
A WINNER NEVER QUITS,
AND A QUITTER NEVER WINS.

21:54.473 --> 21:55.339
AH, THERE SHE IS.

21:55.441 --> 21:57.141
HI, I'M SORRY

22:49.329 --> 22:50.828
(Kate)
I THINK

22:50.930 --> 22:52.263
THAT WE NEED

22:52.365 --> 22:54.198
<i>TO CALL A TRUCE.</i>

22:54.300 --> 22:56.367
I KNOW THAT YOU GUYS HAVE HAD
A LOT OF NANNIES IN HERE.

22:56.469 --> 22:59.070
<i>AND THEY HAVEN'T STAYED,</i>

22:59.172 --> 23:01.973
AND IT'S NOT TOO HARD
FOR ME

23:02.075 --> 23:05.176
<i>TO UNDERSTAND WHY.</i>

23:05.278 --> 23:07.845
HERE'S THE THING.

23:07.947 --> 23:09.247
<i>I'M NOT LEAVING.</i>
IS THAT IT?

23:09.349 --> 23:12.483
YEAH.
OKAY, WELL, THANKS FOR SHARING.

23:16.222 --> 23:18.322
- HEY, KATE?
- MM-HMM.

23:18.424 --> 23:20.524
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING
REALLY IMPORTANT?

23:20.626 --> 23:23.194
SURE, YOU CAN TALK TO ME
ABOUT ANYTHING YOU WANT.

23:23.296 --> 23:25.162
DO I STILL HAVE TO DO
MY HOMEWORK,

23:25.265 --> 23:26.097
EVEN THOUGH IT'S KIND OF WET?

23:26.199 --> 23:27.198
YES.

23:27.300 --> 23:29.700
OH, MAN.

23:29.802 --> 23:31.735
I KNOW.
IT'S A BUMMER.

23:37.010 --> 23:38.976
WANNA KNOW A SECRET?

23:39.078 --> 23:39.944
OKAY.

23:40.046 --> 23:41.045
YOU KNOW HOW THERE'S ALWAYS

23:41.147 --> 23:43.014
A FEW KIDS IN SCHOOL
THAT KNOW EVERYTHING?

23:43.116 --> 23:45.849
<i>THEY KNOW ALL THE ANSWERS
TO THE TEACHERS' QUESTIONS,</i>

23:45.952 --> 23:47.584
THEY ALWAYS GET "A"s
ON THEIR TESTS.

23:47.686 --> 23:49.653
RIGHT.

23:49.755 --> 23:53.424
WELL, SOMETIMES,
WHEN I WOULD STUDY REALLY HARD

23:53.526 --> 23:56.593
AND DO ALL OF MY HOMEWORK,

23:56.695 --> 23:57.628
THAT KID WAS ME.

24:00.433 --> 24:03.034
SO HERE'S THE THING.

24:03.136 --> 24:06.003
I THINK
THAT FROM NOW ON,

24:06.105 --> 24:09.640
YOU SHOULD ALWAYS DO
YOUR HOMEWORK NEAR ME.

24:09.742 --> 24:11.075
THAT WAY,
IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS,

24:11.177 --> 24:12.509
I'M RIGHT HERE
TO HELP YOU.

24:12.611 --> 24:14.078
LIKE YOUR MOM
USED TO HELP YOU?

24:15.048 --> 24:16.880
YEAH.

24:16.983 --> 24:18.049
LIKE MY MOM USED
TO HELP ME.

24:19.218 --> 24:20.184
OKAY.

24:29.195 --> 24:31.028
YOU GUYS BRING ME
YOUR PLATES?

24:32.966 --> 24:36.233
SINCE ALL OF MY PREVIOUS
FREE TIME WAS WASTED

24:36.336 --> 24:37.835
<i>ON DRYING MY HOMEWORK,
I HAVE TO HURRY</i>

24:37.937 --> 24:40.204
SO I'M NOT LATE
FOR MY DANCE CLASS.

24:40.306 --> 24:43.341
I'M SURE YOU DON'T MIND
PICKING UP MY PLATE,

24:43.443 --> 24:44.508
ALL THINGS CONSIDERED.

24:44.610 --> 24:47.678
BESIDES, I THINK IT WOULD FALL
UNDER "HOUSEKEEPING."

24:52.218 --> 24:53.084
- EM.
- HI, DAD.

24:53.186 --> 24:54.918
YEAH. HEY, HEY, BUDDY,
HOW ARE YOU?

24:55.021 --> 24:56.720
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?
IT WAS REALLY GOOD.

24:56.822 --> 24:58.122
- YEAH.
- AND FUNNY.

24:58.224 --> 25:00.057
REALLY, FUNNY, HUH?
HOW WAS IT FUNNY?

25:00.159 --> 25:01.925
NO REASON.

25:02.028 --> 25:02.893
I'M GOING UPSTAIRS.

25:02.996 --> 25:04.428
HOLD ON A SECOND.
HOLD ON A SECOND.

25:04.530 --> 25:05.396
DID YOU DO YOUR HOMEWORK?

25:05.498 --> 25:07.164
YEAH.
ASK KATE.

25:07.266 --> 25:08.732
REALLY.
MM-HMM.

25:10.036 --> 25:10.934
HE DID HIS HOMEWORK?

25:11.037 --> 25:12.269
- BEFORE DINNER?
- YEAH.

25:12.372 --> 25:14.571
HE DID, ACTUALLY,
AND HE STARTED

25:14.673 --> 25:17.241
ON HIS BOOK REPORT
THAT'S DUE NEXT WEEK.

25:17.343 --> 25:18.175
WOW.

25:18.277 --> 25:19.477
I KNOW.

25:19.578 --> 25:21.912
I DON'T THINK
I HAVE THE WORDS

25:22.015 --> 25:22.846
<i>TO EXPLAIN HOW MUCH</i>

25:22.948 --> 25:24.415
OF A HUGE FEAT THAT IS.

25:24.517 --> 25:26.550
USUALLY, WE GET IN A FIGHT
JUST TO GET HIM TO OPEN A BOOK,

25:26.652 --> 25:28.019
AND USUALLY THAT HAPPENS
BEFORE BEDTIME.

25:28.121 --> 25:29.920
- SORRY.
- THANKS.

25:30.023 --> 25:32.023
[sighs]

25:32.125 --> 25:33.857
LISTEN, KATE, I WANTED
TO APOLOGIZE

25:33.959 --> 25:34.925
FOR EMILY'S BEHAVIOR EARLIER.

25:35.028 --> 25:36.394
<i>TOTALLY RUDE</i>

25:36.496 --> 25:37.694
AND UNCALLED FOR,
AND I APOLOGIZE.

25:37.796 --> 25:40.264
THANK YOU.

25:40.366 --> 25:42.566
IT'S JUST A VERY DIFFERENT
DYNAMIC FOR HER.

25:42.668 --> 25:43.934
SHE HAS SOMEONE NEW
IN HER HOME.

25:44.037 --> 25:45.202
YEAH.

25:45.304 --> 25:46.337
YOU'RE RIGHT, MAYBE.

25:47.373 --> 25:50.341
SO, UH, GOT ANY BIG PLANS

25:50.443 --> 25:51.475
<i>FOR THE REST OF THE EVENING?</i>

25:51.577 --> 25:53.744
YEAH, I'M GONNA TUTOR KIDS
AT MY CHURCH.

25:53.846 --> 25:55.312
- WOW. WHAT?
- [laughs]

25:55.415 --> 25:57.481
- THAT'S GREAT.
- UH-HUH.

25:57.583 --> 25:59.650
IT'S JUST THIS LITTLE CENTER
I PUT TOGETHER

25:59.752 --> 26:00.751
A FEW YEARS AGO.

26:00.853 --> 26:03.387
SO IT'S FOR THE KIDS
IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD.

26:03.489 --> 26:05.523
THEY ALL COME
FROM LOW-INCOME FAMILIES,

26:05.624 --> 26:07.291
SO THEY CAN'T AFFORD TUTORS.

26:07.393 --> 26:09.660
BUT THEY'RE GREAT,
GREAT KIDS.

26:09.762 --> 26:10.627
THAT'S INCREDIBLE.

26:10.729 --> 26:14.765
- I, UH, I HAVE TO GO.
- YEAH.

26:14.867 --> 26:16.100
- WE'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.
- OKAY.

26:16.202 --> 26:18.202
GOOD-BYE.

26:20.940 --> 26:22.639
[sighs]

26:26.079 --> 26:28.979
[raspy breathing]

26:30.983 --> 26:33.084
WHAT IS WITH THIS CRAZY THING?

26:33.186 --> 26:35.886
COME ON HERE.

26:35.988 --> 26:38.522
WHERE'D THAT SONG GO?
HUH?

26:38.624 --> 26:40.924
WHATEVER HAPPENED
TO JUST HITTING PLAY?

26:41.026 --> 26:43.060
I CAN'T FIGURE OUT
THIS STUPID THING.

26:43.162 --> 26:44.261
MM-HMM.

26:44.363 --> 26:45.529
I MEAN,
I JUST BARELY TOUCH IT,

26:45.631 --> 26:48.499
AND IT COMES UP
ASKING ABOUT A MENU.

26:48.601 --> 26:50.367
WHAT'S IT THINK,
I'M HUNGRY?

26:50.470 --> 26:51.735
LET'S SEE.

26:51.837 --> 26:53.571
LISA PUT ALL MY FAVORITE SONGS
ON THERE

26:53.672 --> 26:54.972
SO I'D HAVE SOMETHING
TO LISTEN TO,

26:55.074 --> 26:56.974
AND, OF COURSE,
I CAN'T FIND ANYTHING.

26:59.979 --> 27:02.679
HOW'S IT GOING?

27:02.781 --> 27:05.449
OKAY, I JUST--
I'M A LITTLE TIRED.

27:05.551 --> 27:07.551
I'M GONNA GET
SOME BEAUTY SLEEP.

27:13.593 --> 27:16.260
TELL ME
ABOUT YOUR DAY.

27:16.362 --> 27:17.794
MY DAY.

27:17.896 --> 27:21.898
WELL, I THINK
BEN'S COMING AROUND.

27:22.935 --> 27:24.701
WE HAD
A NICE LITTLE MOMENT TODAY.

27:24.803 --> 27:25.836
IN THE KITCHEN.

27:25.938 --> 27:27.938
BONDING IN THE KITCHEN.

27:28.040 --> 27:29.039
LET ME GUESS.

27:29.142 --> 27:29.973
OVER COOKIES?

27:30.075 --> 27:30.941
MATH.

27:31.043 --> 27:32.143
OH, MATH IN THE KITCHEN.

27:32.245 --> 27:33.877
THAT'S LIKE WHEN YOUR MOM

27:33.979 --> 27:34.811
USED TO HELP YOU OUT, HUH?

27:34.913 --> 27:36.480
YEAH.

27:36.582 --> 27:37.748
OH, WHAT ABOUT THE GIRL?
WHAT'S HER NAME?

27:37.850 --> 27:39.483
EMILY.

27:39.585 --> 27:40.851
NOTHING NEW
TO REPORT THERE.

27:40.953 --> 27:44.855
OH, EXCEPT FOR THE FACT
THAT SHE HATES MY GUTS.

27:44.957 --> 27:47.324
OH, WELL,
YOU'LL BRING HER AROUND.

27:47.426 --> 27:48.425
JUST A MATTER OF TIME.

27:48.528 --> 27:49.926
<i>I MEAN, IT WAS HARD
FOR YOU</i>

27:50.029 --> 27:52.095
WHEN YOU WERE HER AGE,
SO YOU CAN SEE

27:52.198 --> 27:53.930
WHERE IT'S GONNA BE HARD
FOR HER.

27:54.033 --> 27:55.466
OKAY, THOSE ARE
THE UPDATES.

27:55.568 --> 27:57.268
SO YOU SHOULD GET
THAT BEAUTY SLEEP

27:57.370 --> 27:58.235
THAT YOU THINK
YOU NEED.

27:58.337 --> 27:59.903
WHAT ABOUT THE--
THE DAD?

28:00.005 --> 28:01.938
- DAVID.
- DAVID'S FINE.

28:03.108 --> 28:05.476
HE'S, YOU KNOW,
MY BOSS.

28:05.578 --> 28:07.144
UH-HUH.

28:07.246 --> 28:09.046
GOOD NIGHT, DADDY.

28:09.148 --> 28:11.948
NIGHT.

28:21.010 --> 28:22.943
<i>(Lisa) I WONDER WHERE
OUR BUS DRIVER IS.</i>

28:23.045 --> 28:26.414
YOUR BOYFRIEND, RAY?
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

28:26.516 --> 28:29.083
I FEEL LIKE HE'S STARTING
TO GROW ON US.

28:29.185 --> 28:30.151
- [sighs]
- ISN'T HE?

28:30.253 --> 28:31.118
ADMIT IT.

28:31.220 --> 28:32.387
I'M ADMITTING TO NOTHING.

28:32.489 --> 28:34.155
HE'S SO FUNNY.

28:34.257 --> 28:35.657
BESIDES, WHAT HAVE I ALWAYS SAID
ABOUT MY PERFECT MAN?

28:35.759 --> 28:37.091
HE'LL GREET ME
AT THE DOOR...

28:37.193 --> 28:38.859
I KNOW, IN A SUIT.

28:38.961 --> 28:40.662
IN A NICE SUIT
AND FLOWERS.

28:40.764 --> 28:44.299
IT'S ACTUALLY A GOOD THING
THAT YOU'RE NOT TOO SPECIFIC

28:44.401 --> 28:47.067
ABOUT EXACTLY WHAT KIND
OF DOOR IT HAS TO BE.

28:48.738 --> 28:49.604
HMM?

28:49.706 --> 28:51.105
HAVE A LOVELY DAY.

28:51.207 --> 28:52.640
OKAY, CRAZY.

28:52.742 --> 28:53.608
BYE.

28:53.710 --> 28:54.776
HAVE A GOOD ONE.

29:00.249 --> 29:01.115
<i>(Ray)
HELLO, LISA.</i>

29:01.217 --> 29:02.183
HELLO, RAY.

29:02.285 --> 29:03.318
I HAVE A LITTLE SOMETHING
FOR YA.

29:03.420 --> 29:04.552
OH, MY GOODNESS.

29:06.088 --> 29:06.921
OH, THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL.

29:07.023 --> 29:08.189
PICKED THOSE
MYSELF.

29:08.291 --> 29:09.223
[laughs]

29:20.903 --> 29:22.537
<i>(David)
WOW.</i>

29:22.639 --> 29:24.205
I GOTTA TELL YA,
I THINK THAT WAS

29:24.307 --> 29:26.040
THE WORLD'S LONGEST
CONFERENCE CALL.

29:26.142 --> 29:28.108
WHAT?

29:28.211 --> 29:29.711
UH, NOTHING,

29:29.813 --> 29:31.779
DO YOU ALWAYS WEAR A BLACK TIE
FOR YOUR CONFERENCE CALLS?

29:31.881 --> 29:33.180
NO, NO, NO,
OF COURSE, NO, I DIDN'T--

29:33.282 --> 29:34.215
NO, I PUT THIS ON

29:34.317 --> 29:35.450
AFTER THE CONFERENCE CALL.

29:35.552 --> 29:36.484
I WAS WEARING
JEANS AND A T-SHIRT.

29:36.586 --> 29:37.652
NO, I WOULD NEVER--
I WAS JUST KIDDING.

29:37.754 --> 29:39.286
RIGHT, YOU WERE KIDDING.

29:39.389 --> 29:40.621
OF COURSE.

29:40.724 --> 29:43.190
AND, OF COURSE,
I ALWAYS, LIKE USUAL,

29:43.292 --> 29:44.726
LOOK OUT OF PRACTICE.

29:44.828 --> 29:45.960
I'M NOT USED TO HAVING SOMEBODY
IN THE HOUSE TO TALK TO.

29:46.062 --> 29:48.396
IT'S-- IT'S BEEN
A WHILE.

29:48.498 --> 29:50.931
I ONLY USUALLY HAVE
EMILY AND BEN...

29:51.033 --> 29:52.700
OR MY WIFE.

29:52.802 --> 29:54.535
OH.

29:55.772 --> 29:57.905
MY WIFE WAS HIT
BY A DRUNK DRIVER AND KILLED

29:58.007 --> 29:59.841
<i>THREE YEARS AGO.</i>

29:59.942 --> 30:03.444
EMILY WAS HAVING
HER 13TH BIRTHDAY AND, UM...

30:03.546 --> 30:06.381
SINCE THEN, IT'S BEEN
REALLY HARD ON ALL OF US.

30:06.483 --> 30:08.215
<i>SO...</i>

30:08.317 --> 30:09.717
I'M SO SORRY.

30:11.855 --> 30:12.953
YEAH.

30:14.323 --> 30:15.956
UM, WHAT IS THAT?

30:16.058 --> 30:17.558
I MEAN, PLEASE TELL ME

30:17.660 --> 30:19.360
MY KIDS HAVEN'T BRIBED YOU
INTO DOING THEIR HOMEWORK.

30:19.462 --> 30:21.996
OH, I, UH--
I JUST--

30:22.098 --> 30:24.365
<i>I'M GETTING
MY TEACHER'S DEGREE.</i>

30:24.467 --> 30:26.501
FINALLY GETTING
MY TEACHER'S DEGREE.

30:26.603 --> 30:27.702
THAT'S FANTASTIC.

30:27.804 --> 30:31.906
IT'S-- AND IT SOUNDS CRAZY,

30:32.008 --> 30:33.708
<i>JUST THAT I'VE, YOU KNOW,
WAITED THIS LONG</i>

30:33.810 --> 30:36.444
TO FINALLY GET IT,
BUT IT'S JUST--

30:36.546 --> 30:39.246
IT'S ALWAYS BEEN A DREAM
OF MINE TO BE...

30:39.348 --> 30:40.247
A TEACHER.

30:40.349 --> 30:42.650
THAT DOESN'T SOUND CRAZY
AT ALL.

30:42.752 --> 30:44.385
I MEAN, WHAT WOULD BE CRAZY
IS YOU NOT GOING

30:44.487 --> 30:46.353
<i>AFTER YOUR DREAM,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?</i>

30:46.456 --> 30:47.522
I DO HAVE ONE CONCERN.

30:48.525 --> 30:49.457
DOES THAT MEAN I'M GONNA HAVE

30:49.559 --> 30:50.558
TO START INTERVIEWING NANNIES
SOON?

30:50.660 --> 30:52.727
I PROMISE I'LL GIVE YOU
PLENTY OF NOTICE.

30:57.500 --> 30:59.400
BYE. THANKS.

31:03.606 --> 31:05.540

THANKS FOR THE RIDE.

31:19.255 --> 31:20.721

31:33.235 --> 31:35.135
KATE, I HAVE
A DANCE RECITAL COMING UP.

31:35.237 --> 31:36.671
SO I HAVE A LOT
OF REHEARSALS.

31:36.773 --> 31:37.939
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD HAVE
MY DANCE CLOTHES

31:38.040 --> 31:39.273
WASHED AND READY
FOR NEXT WEEK?

31:39.375 --> 31:40.775
YES, YES.

31:40.877 --> 31:42.777
UH, JUST LEAVE IT
IN THE LAUNDRY ROOM.

31:44.681 --> 31:45.580
THANKS.

YEAH, I'M JUST GONNA CALL DAVID,
AND I'M GONNA TELL HIM

33:03.760 --> 33:04.692
I CAN'T WORK TONIGHT.
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

33:04.794 --> 33:05.760
JUST FOR TONIGHT.

33:05.862 --> 33:06.994
I'M GONNA TAKE THIS--
I'M ALL RIGHT.

33:07.096 --> 33:08.629
AND LISA'S COMING BY LATER
TO SEE IF I NEED ANYTHING,

33:08.731 --> 33:09.964
SO YOU JUST GO ON.

33:10.066 --> 33:11.131
ALL RIGHT, WELL, THEN I'M GOING
TO CALL THE DOCTOR,

33:11.233 --> 33:12.066
AND I'M GOING TO ASK HIM
TO BE ON CALL FOR YOU.

33:12.168 --> 33:13.434
- NO, YOU'RE NOT.
- YES, DADDY.

33:13.536 --> 33:14.368
I'M JUST GONNA HAVE HIM BE
ON CALL FOR ONE EVENING.

33:14.470 --> 33:16.837
I GOT A TICKLE
IN MY THROAT.

33:16.940 --> 33:18.973
HOW SILLY ARE YOU GONNA FEEL
BOTHERING THE BUSY DOCTOR

33:19.075 --> 33:20.675
TO TELL HIM
THAT I'VE GOT A TICKLE?

33:20.777 --> 33:22.944
OKAY.

33:23.046 --> 33:24.078
THAT TICKLE DOESN'T GO AWAY
BY TOMORROW,

33:24.180 --> 33:25.012
I'M CALLING HIM.

33:25.114 --> 33:26.246
FINE.

33:26.348 --> 33:27.615
- JUST GO ON.
- HERE'S YOUR WATER.

33:30.486 --> 33:31.619
AND YOU'RE GONNA CALL ME
IF YOU NEED ME, RIGHT?

33:36.859 --> 33:39.426
SO I GUESS
JERRY WAS RIGHT AFTER ALL.

33:39.528 --> 33:41.062
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

33:41.163 --> 33:42.797
OH, HE SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT YOU STOPPING IN HERE

33:42.899 --> 33:43.831
A FEW TIMES
BETWEEN CLASSES

33:43.933 --> 33:44.966
<i>AND YOUR JOB.</i>

33:45.068 --> 33:46.200
<i>SOMETHING ABOUT,
I DON'T KNOW,</i>

33:46.302 --> 33:47.835
<i>GETTING ALL SPRUCED UP
FOR WORK.</i>

33:47.937 --> 33:49.570
SPRUCED UP?
WHO SAYS SPRUCED UP?

33:49.672 --> 33:50.705
[chuckling]
YOUR DAD.

33:53.442 --> 33:55.076
- THE DRESS IS TOO MUCH?
- NO.

33:55.177 --> 33:56.110
YOU LOOK AWESOME.

33:57.379 --> 33:58.345
FOR A DATE.

34:01.718 --> 34:02.750
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

34:02.852 --> 34:04.184
I WILL COME IN
AND CHECK IN A FEW HOURS

34:04.286 --> 34:05.753
- ON JERRY, OKAY?
- <i>THANK YOU.</i>

34:05.855 --> 34:07.588
BYE.

34:12.527 --> 34:13.928
THANK YOU. WE'LL GET BACK TO
YOU AT THE END OF THE WEEK.

34:14.030 --> 34:14.929
THAT'S GREAT,
GREAT.

34:15.031 --> 34:16.097
DAVID, THANKS AGAIN.

34:16.197 --> 34:17.031
- ABSOLUTELY.
- YES, SIR.

34:17.132 --> 34:17.998
JIM, TAKE CARE.

34:18.101 --> 34:19.433
THANKS A LOT. SEE YA.
ALL RIGHT.

34:19.534 --> 34:21.502
<i>OKAY.</i>

34:21.603 --> 34:23.938
OKAY.

34:25.440 --> 34:27.474
WHAT IS GOING ON
WITH YOU?

34:27.576 --> 34:28.475
WHY DON'T YOU GET THAT?

34:28.577 --> 34:31.078
YOU KNOW, YOU RARELY LET ME
DO THE TALKING

34:31.179 --> 34:32.279
ON A BID THIS BIG,
AND RIGHT NOW,

34:32.380 --> 34:34.949
MY THROAT IS ACTUALLY SORE
FROM OVERUSE.

34:35.051 --> 34:36.884
I LEFT YOU THREE MESSAGES
TODAY, YOU KNOW.

34:36.985 --> 34:38.252
YOU DIDN'T RETURN
ONE OF THEM.

34:38.353 --> 34:40.521
YOU KNOW, THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR
CAN ONLY MEAN ONE THING.

34:40.623 --> 34:42.222
SO, UH...

34:42.324 --> 34:43.991
WHO IS SHE?

34:45.594 --> 34:47.027
WAIT A MINUTE.

34:48.864 --> 34:49.964
IT'S THE NANNY.

34:50.065 --> 34:51.098
KEEP IT DOWN.

34:51.199 --> 34:52.366
AM I RIGHT?
IS THAT IT?

34:52.467 --> 34:53.967
CHRIS, WILL YOU KEEP IT DOWN?

34:54.070 --> 34:54.935
<i>HOW COULD YOU KEEP THIS
FROM ME,</i>

34:55.038 --> 34:56.170
YOUR PARTNER,
YOUR BEST FRIEND?

34:56.272 --> 34:57.171
I KNOW
YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND, BROTHER,

34:57.273 --> 34:58.472
BUT THERE'S NOTHING
TO TELL YOU.

34:58.574 --> 35:01.208
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO,
THAT'S-- THAT'S NOT IT.

35:01.310 --> 35:02.643
<i>THERE'S ALWAYS A STORY,
AND IF THERE'S NOT A STORY,</i>

35:02.745 --> 35:04.578
AT LEAST BE CONSIDERATE ENOUGH
TO MAKE ONE UP FOR ME.

35:04.681 --> 35:07.347
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO TELL YOU.

35:07.449 --> 35:10.117
OH, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT IS, MAN.

35:10.219 --> 35:13.187
IT'S, LIKE,
SHE MAKES ME SMILE

35:13.289 --> 35:14.855
WHEN I'M AROUND HER,
YOU KNOW.

35:14.957 --> 35:16.356
I HAVEN'T SMILED LIKE THAT
IN YEARS.

35:16.458 --> 35:18.592
SHE'S AMAZING.

35:18.695 --> 35:19.927
I ALSO TURN INTO, APPARENTLY,
A COMPLETE KLUTZ

35:20.029 --> 35:21.729
<i>WHEN I'M AROUND HER.</i>

35:21.831 --> 35:22.763
I MEAN, I GO UP TO HER,
AND I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING,

35:22.865 --> 35:24.264
AND I FEEL LIKE I CAN,
AND I'M LIKE--

35:24.366 --> 35:25.332
AH!

35:25.434 --> 35:26.600
LIKE I'M LIKE AN IDIOT.

35:26.703 --> 35:28.903
A BUMBLING FOOL.

35:29.005 --> 35:30.304
SHE'S SMART.

35:30.406 --> 35:31.906
SHE'S KIND.
SHE'S CARING.

35:32.008 --> 35:33.640
I MEAN, SHE'S--
DO YOU KNOW SHE'S GOING

35:33.743 --> 35:35.342
AFTER A TEACHING DEGREE?

35:35.444 --> 35:37.144
SO SHE'S EDUCATED.
SHE LIKES MY KIDS.

35:37.246 --> 35:38.545
[snickers]
WELL.

35:38.647 --> 35:39.613
WELL WHAT?

35:39.716 --> 35:42.216
WELL, I MEAN, YOU DO PAY HER
FOR THAT.

35:42.318 --> 35:43.350
- CHRIS.
- SORRY.

35:43.452 --> 35:44.284
I'M TRYING TO BE SERIOUS.

35:44.386 --> 35:45.519
NO, PLEASE,
GO ON, GO ON.

35:45.621 --> 35:47.521
WHAT'S YOUR--
WHAT'S YOUR, UH, PLAN OF ACTION?

35:47.623 --> 35:48.622
THERE'S NO PLAN OF ACTION.

35:48.725 --> 35:49.590
CHRIS, WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT THE NANNY.

35:49.692 --> 35:50.591
<i>END OF STORY.</i>

35:50.693 --> 35:52.059
WHOA, WHAT DO YOU MEAN
END OF STORY?

35:52.161 --> 35:53.427
THIS IS LIKE CHAPTER ONE
OF THE STORY.

35:53.529 --> 35:55.062
THIS IS THE FIRST NANNY
THAT HASN'T QUIT

35:55.164 --> 35:56.496
IN A MATTER OF HOURS,
CHRIS, LET ALONE A DAY.

35:56.599 --> 35:57.798
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT ME
TO DO HERE?

35:57.900 --> 36:00.300
<i>SHE'S GREAT WITH THE KIDS,
SHE LOVES BEN,</i>

36:00.402 --> 36:01.668
SHE-- YOU KNOW THAT BEN
IS ACTUALLY DOING HIS HOMEWORK

36:01.771 --> 36:03.604
- <i>BEFORE DINNER?</i>
- REALLY?

36:03.706 --> 36:04.839
AND EM,
DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED.

36:04.941 --> 36:06.440
THIS WOMAN HAS
INCREDIBLE PATIENCE WITH EM.

36:06.542 --> 36:07.474
EVEN WHEN SHE PUSHES
THE ENVELOPE,

36:07.576 --> 36:09.343
AND, HEY, AS HER GODFATHER,

36:09.445 --> 36:10.911
<i>YOU COMPLETELY KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.</i>

36:11.013 --> 36:12.113
AND WHAT IF IT DOESN'T WORK OUT
WITH HER?

36:12.215 --> 36:13.714
<i>THEN WHAT?
THEN WHERE AM I?</i>

36:13.816 --> 36:16.784
I'M NOT SCREWING UP
A GOOD THING.

36:16.886 --> 36:17.785
I CAN'T AFFORD TO.

36:23.960 --> 36:24.992
(Ben)
THIS MATH IS TOUGH.

36:26.395 --> 36:29.130
YEAH.
YOU CAN DO IT, THOUGH.

36:29.232 --> 36:31.031
YOU'RE THE SMARTEST KID
I KNOW.

36:31.134 --> 36:32.666
<i>JUST TAKE YOUR TIME
WITH IT.</i>

36:35.004 --> 36:36.170
LET'S SEE
WHAT YOU GOT.

36:38.440 --> 36:41.575
UH, OKAY, HOW DO YOU CHANGE
3/4 INTO A DECIMAL?

36:41.677 --> 36:43.343
<i>(Ben)
MM.</i>

36:44.981 --> 36:46.914
MAYBE BY USING
YOUR DIVISION?

36:47.016 --> 36:48.149
RIGHT.

36:48.251 --> 36:50.651
<i>WAIT.</i>

36:50.753 --> 36:52.519
FOUR GOES INTO THREE
HOW MANY TIMES?

36:52.621 --> 36:53.620
DON'T FORGET
YOUR DECIMAL POINT.

36:53.722 --> 36:56.023
<i>(Ben)
OKAY, HOLD ON.</i>

36:56.125 --> 36:57.391
I GOT IT.

36:57.493 --> 36:58.458
IT'S .75.

36:58.560 --> 37:00.261
THAT'S RIGHT.
GENIUS.

37:00.362 --> 37:01.996
GUILTY.

37:02.098 --> 37:03.264
GOOD JOB, BUDDY.

37:03.365 --> 37:04.564
HEY, DAD.
SHOW ME SOME LOVE.

37:04.667 --> 37:05.732
THAT A BOY.

37:05.835 --> 37:07.434
DAD, YOU SHOULD SEE
HOW EASY MATH IS NOW.

37:07.536 --> 37:08.936
'CAUSE OF KATE.

37:09.038 --> 37:10.570
SHE MADE IT
SO SIMPLE.

37:10.673 --> 37:11.605
NO, IT'S NOT
BECAUSE OF ME.

37:11.707 --> 37:12.539
IT'S BECAUSE YOUR SON

37:12.641 --> 37:14.741
<i>IS INCREDIBLY SMART.</i>

37:14.844 --> 37:16.076
INCREDIBLY SMART, HUH?

37:16.179 --> 37:17.044
[Ben laughs]

37:17.146 --> 37:18.813
WHY, THE ULTRA-LAME
HAPPY PARTY?

37:18.915 --> 37:20.915
WELL, THANKS TO KATE HERE,
YOUR BROTHER NOW LOVES MATH.

37:21.017 --> 37:22.183
<i>AND SINCE YOU USED
TO NOT LOVE MATH,</i>

37:22.285 --> 37:23.517
I'D HARDLY CALL THAT
ULTRA-LAME.

37:23.619 --> 37:25.619
OH, THAT'S WHAT
ALL THE EXCITEMENT IS ABOUT?

37:25.721 --> 37:26.720
<i>MATH?</i>

37:26.823 --> 37:28.055
SERIOUSLY?

37:28.157 --> 37:30.691
DAD, HOW ABOUT WE SAY
I KINDA LIKE MATH?

37:30.793 --> 37:32.626
I DON'T KNOW
IF I COULD EVER LOVE IT.

37:32.728 --> 37:34.461
[laughter]

37:34.563 --> 37:36.096
DEAL.

37:36.199 --> 37:37.298
HEY, HOW ABOUT WE
GO OUTSIDE

37:37.399 --> 37:38.765
AND THROW THE BALL AROUND
A LITTLE BIT BEFORE DINNER?

37:38.868 --> 37:40.767
REALLY? CAN WE?
ABSOLUTELY. ABSOLUTELY.

37:40.870 --> 37:43.270
<i>(Ben) ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.</i>

37:48.177 --> 37:50.477
YOU KNOW WHAT MY MOTHER USED
TO SAY TO ME?

37:50.579 --> 37:51.979
DO YOU WANT ME
TO, LIKE, GUESS?

37:52.081 --> 37:53.280
OR IS THIS
ONE OF THOSE QUESTIONS

37:53.382 --> 37:55.015
<i>YOU REALLY DON'T WANT PEOPLE
TO ANSWER?</i>

37:55.117 --> 37:57.551
SHE USED TO SAY,
DO YOU THINK IF YOU STAND

37:57.653 --> 37:59.386
IN FRONT OF THAT REFRIGERATOR
WITH THE DOOR OPEN

37:59.488 --> 38:01.155
FOR LONG ENOUGH
THAT NEW MAGICAL FOOD CHOICES

38:01.257 --> 38:03.090
<i>ARE GONNA APPEAR?</i>

38:03.192 --> 38:04.225
SO LET ME GUESS.

38:04.327 --> 38:05.259
THE END OF THE STORY IS
YOU CLOSE THE DOOR.

38:07.296 --> 38:11.031
UH, NO, ACTUALLY,
I USED TO SAY, "YES.

38:11.133 --> 38:14.501
<i>I DO THINK THAT, MOM."</i>

38:14.603 --> 38:15.870
AND I'D LEAVE
THE DOOR OPEN.

38:23.312 --> 38:24.778
HAVE TO TRY THAT
ON MY DAD NEXT TIME.

38:24.881 --> 38:26.480
WANT ME TO MAKE YOU SOMETHING
TO EAT

38:26.582 --> 38:27.848
BEFORE YOU HAVE TO LEAVE
FOR DANCE CLASS?

38:27.950 --> 38:31.085
IT'S OKAY.
I'LL GRAB SOMETHING THERE.

38:31.187 --> 38:32.386
BUT, UH,
THANKS ANYWAY.

38:32.488 --> 38:33.420
OKAY.

38:33.522 --> 38:34.554
HEY, HOW LONG DID YOU USE

38:34.656 --> 38:35.589
THAT LINE ON YOUR MOM?

38:37.026 --> 38:38.359
UNTIL I WAS 16.

38:38.460 --> 38:40.627
WELL, THAT WAS PROBABLY
A GOOD TIME TO STOP.

38:40.729 --> 38:41.661
'CAUSE IF YOU STAND
IN FRONT OF THE FRIDGE

38:41.764 --> 38:43.130
AS MUCH AS I DO,

38:43.232 --> 38:44.932
YOUR MOM WAS PROBABLY GETTING
TIRED OF HEARING YOU SAY THAT,

38:45.034 --> 38:46.367
OVER AND OVER.

38:46.468 --> 38:50.371
ACTUALLY, I, UM, I THINK
SHE WOULD HAVE LIKED

38:50.472 --> 38:52.539
TO HAVE HEARD ME SAY IT
OVER AND OVER.

38:52.641 --> 38:55.910
FOR ANOTHER HUNDRED YEARS.

38:56.012 --> 38:56.977
WELL, THAT MUST BE
REALLY NICE.

38:57.079 --> 38:59.046
<i>FOR YOU TO HAVE
THAT OPTION.</i>

38:59.148 --> 39:01.615
COMING UP WITH STUPID COMEBACKS
TO SAY TO YOUR MOM.

39:13.073 --> 39:14.439
THIS IS GOOD.

39:14.541 --> 39:16.408
THIS IS THE STUFF
THAT YOU REMEMBER REALLY WELL.

39:16.510 --> 39:17.709
- MISS HEWITT?
- YEAH.

39:17.811 --> 39:20.178
WHEN I FIRST CAME HERE,
YOU KNOW, FOR HELP,

39:20.281 --> 39:21.880
THINGS WEREN'T SO GREAT.

39:21.982 --> 39:25.417
NOT AT HOME, OR AT SCHOOL,
OR ANYWHERE, REALLY.

39:25.519 --> 39:27.185
IT WAS PRETTY BAD
ALL AROUND.

39:27.288 --> 39:28.387
I REMEMBER.

39:28.489 --> 39:30.422
I REALLY DIDN'T EVEN WANT
TO KEEP COMING HERE,

39:30.524 --> 39:33.759
YOU KNOW, BUT I DON'T KNOW,
FOR SOME REASON, I DID.

39:33.860 --> 39:36.027
AND I GUESS
IT WAS 'CAUSE OF YOU.

39:36.129 --> 39:37.529
OH.

39:37.631 --> 39:39.331
IT'S LIKE, YOU KNOW, ALL
THE HELP YOU'VE BEEN GIVING ME,

39:39.433 --> 39:41.600
AND TELLING ME HOW SMART
I AM AND STUFF,

39:41.702 --> 39:43.402
AND ALL THE THINGS YOU SAY
I CAN DO WITH MY LIFE?

39:43.504 --> 39:46.538
NOW, I REALLY THINK
I CAN DO ANYTHING.

39:46.640 --> 39:48.407
I JUST WANTED
TO SAY THANKS FOR THAT.

39:48.509 --> 39:50.074
WELL, YOU'RE WELCOME.

39:52.479 --> 39:54.346
ALL RIGHT.

39:54.448 --> 39:56.348
OKAY, SO THIS IS THE PART THAT
YOU'RE REMEMBERING REALLY WELL,

39:56.450 --> 39:57.382
AND THIS IS THE PART
THAT YOU NEED

39:57.484 --> 39:58.917
TO GO OVER AND OVER
A FEW TIMES.

40:18.071 --> 40:19.070
AM I DISTURBING YOU?

40:19.172 --> 40:21.506
WELL, I COULD ASK
THE SAME THING OF YOU.

40:21.608 --> 40:24.075
KATE, YOU'RE NOT DISTURBING ME.

40:24.177 --> 40:25.344
YOU KNOW
YOU'RE ALWAYS WELCOME HERE.

40:26.580 --> 40:28.547
YOU ALL DONE
FOR THE NIGHT?

40:28.649 --> 40:32.984
OH, YEAH, I'M DONE
WITH WORK AND TUTORING,

40:33.086 --> 40:36.388
AND I JUST HAVE
A FEW HOURS OF STUDYING LEFT.

40:36.490 --> 40:40.225
I JUST THOUGHT I'D COME HERE
AND GET A FEW MOMENTS

40:40.327 --> 40:42.361
OF NOTHINGNESS
BEFORE I GET HOME.

40:42.463 --> 40:44.796
WELL, SOMETIMES,
A LITTLE BIT OF NOTHINGNESS

40:44.898 --> 40:45.797
CAN CURE A BAD DAY.

40:47.000 --> 40:47.999
YEAH.

40:49.370 --> 40:51.703
I THINK THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG
WITH ME.

40:53.674 --> 40:56.775
I'M WATCHING THESE TWO KIDS.

40:56.877 --> 41:00.078
THERE'S THIS LITTLE BOY.
HE'S 9.

41:00.180 --> 41:01.680
HE'S AMAZING.

41:01.782 --> 41:02.814
YEAH.

41:02.916 --> 41:06.050
AND THEN HIS SISTER IS...

41:07.755 --> 41:08.587
UNBELIEVABLE.

41:08.689 --> 41:11.490
SHE'S SO ANGRY

41:11.592 --> 41:14.826
<i>AND HAS SUCH AN ENORMOUS CHIP
ON HER SHOULDER.</i>

41:14.928 --> 41:17.596
AND I DON'T THINK I'M DOING
A VERY GOOD JOB WITH HER.

41:19.366 --> 41:22.133
HER MOM DIED
A FEW YEARS AGO,

41:22.235 --> 41:25.470
<i>AND SHE WAS ONLY 13,
SO.</i>

41:25.572 --> 41:27.205
<i>NOW, IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO,</i>

41:27.307 --> 41:29.775
BUT I-I REMEMBER

41:29.877 --> 41:33.678
A VERY ANGRY,
VERY SAD YOUNG GIRL

41:33.781 --> 41:37.048
WHO, UH, WHOSE FATHER
USED TO DRAG HER TO THIS CHURCH

41:37.150 --> 41:39.785
<i>EVERY SUNDAY.</i>

41:39.887 --> 41:41.520
<i>AND WHEN SHE STARTED OUT,
OH,</i>

41:41.622 --> 41:43.955
SHE WAS
IN A HORRIBLE PLACE.

41:44.057 --> 41:45.791
SOME DAYS, SHE WAS DOWNRIGHT
INCORRIGIBLE.

41:45.893 --> 41:47.859
<i>BUT BIT BY BIT,</i>

41:47.961 --> 41:49.260
SHE-- SHE FOUND HER WAY.

41:49.362 --> 41:53.632
<i>SHE STARTED RELATING
TO OTHER PEOPLE,</i>

41:53.734 --> 41:55.734
<i>AND LEARNED
HOW TO RESPECT THEM.</i>

41:55.836 --> 41:59.203
<i>SHE EVEN DID
A LOT BETTER IN SCHOOL.</i>

41:59.306 --> 42:00.939
AND, YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES,
I WONDER

42:01.041 --> 42:03.274
WHATEVER HAPPENED
TO THAT YOUNG GIRL.

42:03.376 --> 42:05.677
YEAH, I WONDER
IF SHE TURNED OUT OKAY?

42:06.747 --> 42:08.346
[laughs]

42:09.850 --> 42:10.882
[groans]

42:12.052 --> 42:15.854
NO, YOU-- YOU JUST HAVE TO TRUST
IN GOD, KATE.

42:15.956 --> 42:19.123
<i>TRUST THAT YOU'LL BE LED
AND GUIDED</i>

42:19.225 --> 42:20.659
<i>TO FIND THE RIGHT
AND PERFECT WAY</i>

42:20.761 --> 42:22.694
<i>TO REACH
THIS LOVELY YOUNG GIRL.</i>

42:22.796 --> 42:25.597
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES,
PEOPLE JUST NEED TO BE SHOWN

42:25.699 --> 42:26.665
HOW TO GET IN TOUCH
WITH THEIR FAITH.

42:26.767 --> 42:29.000
<i>IT WORKED FOR YOU.</i>

42:29.102 --> 42:30.669
<i>ALL THOSE YEARS AGO.</i>

42:30.771 --> 42:34.606
AH, YOU'LL DO
JUST FINE.

42:34.708 --> 42:37.742
AND GIVE MY LOVE
TO YOUR DAD.

42:39.112 --> 42:41.012
I WILL.

42:56.830 --> 42:58.196
<i>(David)
ANYBODY HOME?</i>

42:58.298 --> 43:00.431
UH, JUST ME.

43:03.804 --> 43:05.336
- JUST YOU, HUH?
- YEAH.

43:06.807 --> 43:07.639
WHERE ARE THE KIDS?

43:07.741 --> 43:09.941
UH, BEN IS
AT HIS SLEEPOVER,

43:10.043 --> 43:12.944
AND EMILY IS AT DANCE PRACTICE
FOR HER RECITAL.

43:13.046 --> 43:14.245
YEAH, HER RECITAL.

43:14.347 --> 43:17.315
SO I GUESS, UH,
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

43:18.719 --> 43:19.784
I'LL SEE YOU
TOMORROW.

43:19.887 --> 43:21.553
UH, KATE,
ACTUALLY, UM...

43:22.789 --> 43:24.222
I JUST WANTED TO ASK YOU
HOW THE EXAM WENT.

43:24.324 --> 43:26.758
OH.

43:26.860 --> 43:28.560
THE EXAM WENT
INCREDIBLE.

43:28.662 --> 43:29.995
YEAH?

43:30.096 --> 43:33.698
AND...
BEN GOT AN A.

43:34.868 --> 43:35.734
THAT'S FANTASTIC.

43:35.836 --> 43:37.669
I KNOW.
HE WAS SO HAPPY.

43:37.771 --> 43:39.804
YEAH, I ACTUALLY MEANT
YOUR EXAM.

43:39.907 --> 43:41.272
OH.

43:41.374 --> 43:42.440
HOW'D YOUR EXAM GO?

43:42.543 --> 43:44.175
UH, IT WENT GREAT.

43:45.311 --> 43:46.778
I GOT AN A AS WELL.

43:46.880 --> 43:48.179
THAT'S GREAT.
THAT'S FANTASTIC.

43:48.281 --> 43:49.447
<i>THAT CALLS
FOR A CELEBRATION.</i>

43:49.550 --> 43:50.381
IT DOES.

43:50.483 --> 43:51.349
LET-- WE HAVE TO CELEBRATE.

43:51.451 --> 43:52.383
I MEAN, UNLESS YOU HAVE PLANS.

43:52.485 --> 43:53.752
I DON'T HAVE PLANS.

43:53.854 --> 43:55.253
GREAT.

43:55.355 --> 43:56.187
THEN WE'LL CELEBRATE.

43:56.289 --> 43:57.288
OKAY.

44:09.369 --> 44:11.269
- HEY.
- HEY.

44:12.773 --> 44:13.738
EVERYTHING OKAY?

44:13.840 --> 44:15.139
OH, THANK YOU.

44:15.241 --> 44:16.340
CHEERS.

44:16.443 --> 44:18.543
I, UH-- CHEERS.

44:18.645 --> 44:19.578
[clink]

44:22.716 --> 44:23.548
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

44:23.650 --> 44:25.416
I JUST NEEDED TO CALL HOME

44:25.518 --> 44:27.752
AND MAKE SURE
I WASN'T NEEDED.

44:27.854 --> 44:29.320
RIGHT, RIGHT.

44:29.422 --> 44:31.522
[laughs]
I'M SITTING HERE,

44:31.625 --> 44:34.593
SELFISHLY THINKING THAT
YOU'RE ONLY NEEDED IN MY HOME,

44:34.695 --> 44:35.827
AND FORGOT TO REALIZE
THAT MAYBE SOMEBODY

44:35.929 --> 44:36.995
IN YOUR OWN HOME
NEEDS YOU AS WELL.

44:37.097 --> 44:38.763
I'M SORRY.
I APOLOGIZE.

44:38.865 --> 44:42.734
OH, NO, IT'S-- IT'S...

44:42.836 --> 44:43.868
IT'S JUST MY FATHER.

44:43.971 --> 44:47.271
SO HE'S NOT FEELING WELL.

44:47.373 --> 44:49.074
BUT HE'S HAD HEART DISEASE
SINCE I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL,

44:49.175 --> 44:51.109
SO I'VE BEEN TAKING CARE OF HIM
FOR A LONG TIME.

44:51.211 --> 44:52.110
- SINCE HIGH SCHOOL?
- YEAH.

44:52.212 --> 44:53.078
THAT'S A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY

44:53.179 --> 44:54.178
FOR SOMEBODY IN HIGH SCHOOL.

44:54.280 --> 44:55.246
WISH EM WAS HERE.

44:55.348 --> 44:56.848
IF SHE HEARD THIS,
MAYBE SHE'D GET

44:56.950 --> 44:58.650
A WELL-NEEDED
BEHAVIORAL ADJUSTMENT.

44:58.752 --> 44:59.684
CAN I GIVE YOU
SOME ADVICE?

44:59.786 --> 45:00.652
I MEAN,
DO YOU WANT MY ADVICE?

45:00.754 --> 45:02.721
ON WHAT? ON EM?
ABSOLUTELY.

45:02.823 --> 45:03.922
- PLEASE.
- YEAH. OKAY.

45:04.024 --> 45:06.124
UH, I JUST THINK
THAT, UH--

45:06.226 --> 45:07.892
SHE HAS A BIRTHDAY COMING UP.

45:07.995 --> 45:10.294
I THINK SHE'S PROBABLY MISSING
HER MOM A LOT,

45:10.396 --> 45:12.163
- EVEN MORE THAN NORMAL.
- YEAH.

45:12.265 --> 45:15.800
YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.

45:15.902 --> 45:16.968
AND EITHER
I'M A HORRIBLE PARENT

45:17.070 --> 45:18.336
OR YOU'RE AN INCREDIBLY
INTELLIGENT WOMAN.

45:18.438 --> 45:19.871
NO.

45:19.973 --> 45:22.507
IT'S NEITHER.
TRUST ME.

45:22.609 --> 45:25.443
I JUST-- I LOST MY MOTHER
WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL

45:25.545 --> 45:27.345
TO CANCER.

45:27.447 --> 45:30.115
AND I JUST REMEMBER THINKING,
YOU KNOW,

45:30.216 --> 45:33.184
THAT IT WAS SO TOUGH
RIGHT BEFORE SHE DIED,

45:33.286 --> 45:36.655
AND IT TURNS OUT
THAT, UM, THAT WAS NOTHING

45:36.757 --> 45:37.588
COMPARED TO WHAT IT WAS LIKE

45:37.691 --> 45:38.623
THE NEXT FEW YEARS
WITHOUT HER.

45:38.725 --> 45:42.027
I'M SORRY
YOU WENT THROUGH THAT.

45:42.129 --> 45:44.529
IT MUST HAVE BEEN
INCREDIBLY HARD ON YOU.

45:46.166 --> 45:48.800
UH, EMILY'S GONNA BE FINE.

45:48.902 --> 45:51.402
YOU KNOW, SHE JUST NEEDS
A LITTLE MORE TIME.

45:51.504 --> 45:52.370
[laughter]

45:52.472 --> 45:53.638
- WHAT?
- NOTHING.

45:53.740 --> 45:56.507
WHAT?

45:56.609 --> 45:59.644
UM, I'M JUST GLAD
YOU STAYED.

45:59.746 --> 46:01.179
OH.

46:02.849 --> 46:07.018
UM, I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHY I WOULDN'T STAY.

46:07.120 --> 46:11.389
<i>UH, YOUR HOUSE IS BEAUTIFUL,
YOUR KIDS ARE GREAT.</i>

46:11.491 --> 46:12.724
<i>I LOVE BEING</i>

46:12.826 --> 46:15.660
SOAKED IN LAUNDRY...

46:15.762 --> 46:17.595
- DETERGENT.
- [laughs]

46:17.698 --> 46:22.067
AND THE SPRINKLER MISHAPS
ARE MY FAVORITE.

46:22.169 --> 46:26.304
AND I THINK I MAY BE IN LOVE
WITH YOUR KILLER PET RAT, LOUIE.

46:26.406 --> 46:28.272
LOUIE, YEAH.

46:28.374 --> 46:29.207
WELL, DON'T BEAT YOURSELF UP
TOO BAD.

46:29.309 --> 46:30.175
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHO FELL

46:30.276 --> 46:31.342
FOR THEIR WELL-REHEARSED
SHENANIGANS.

46:31.444 --> 46:32.543
THAT'S FOR SURE.
OH, I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE.

46:32.645 --> 46:34.112
MM-MM.

46:34.214 --> 46:35.914
THAT ACTUALLY DOES MAKE ME
FEEL REALLY GOOD.

46:36.016 --> 46:37.248
REALLY?

46:37.350 --> 46:38.850
TO KNOW THAT I WASN'T
THE FIRST ONE TO FALL PREY.

46:38.952 --> 46:41.720
WELL, YOU'RE NOT,
BUT YOU ARE

46:41.822 --> 46:43.121
THE ONLY ONE WHO STAYED.

46:48.962 --> 46:51.129
AND...

46:51.231 --> 46:53.431
ARE YOU MAKING
A MOVE ON ME?

46:53.533 --> 46:54.632
HOW AM I DOING?

46:57.137 --> 46:58.837
YOU'RE DOING WELL.

47:06.947 --> 47:07.979
(Emily)
THIS IS AWKWARD.

47:08.081 --> 47:09.147
EMILY, YOU'RE HOME.

47:09.249 --> 47:10.348
OH. GOODNESS.

47:10.450 --> 47:11.983
EMILY, UM...

47:12.085 --> 47:14.052
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT LIKE
TO KNOW THAT I WAS HOME.

47:14.154 --> 47:16.420
EM.
APPARENTLY NOT.

47:16.522 --> 47:17.956
- EMILY.
- GO.

47:19.760 --> 47:21.159
- YEAH.
- <i>YEAH.</i>

47:31.471 --> 47:32.336
EM.

47:32.438 --> 47:33.604
CAN I COME IN?

47:37.610 --> 47:39.244
I'M REALLY TIRED, DAD.

47:39.345 --> 47:40.178
CAN IT WAIT
TILL MORNING?

47:40.280 --> 47:44.482
YEAH, SWEETIE,
IT CAN WAIT.

47:44.584 --> 47:45.483
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
YOU'RE OKAY WITH--

47:45.585 --> 47:46.651
I'M FINE.

47:47.887 --> 47:49.020
NO BIG DEAL.
I'M JUST TIRED.

47:50.723 --> 47:51.990
<i>OKAY, HONEY.</i>

47:52.092 --> 47:54.192
I'LL SEE YOU
IN THE MORNING.

48:00.333 --> 48:02.267
[sniffles]

48:52.833 --> 48:55.133
WHAT IS IT?

48:55.235 --> 48:56.568
WHAT'S BOTHERING YOU?

48:56.670 --> 48:59.037
OH, IT'S NOTHING.

48:59.139 --> 49:01.306
EMILY'S DANCE RECITAL'S
THIS WEEKEND.

49:01.408 --> 49:03.074
I JUST FEEL
KIND OF NERVOUS.

49:03.176 --> 49:04.075
I JUST WANT IT
TO GO, OKAY.

49:04.177 --> 49:06.345
YOU KNOW,
I'M GOING.

49:06.447 --> 49:07.912
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU GUYS
HAVE KISSED OR ANYTHING.

49:10.984 --> 49:14.353
OH, KATE, HE IS YOUR BOSS.

49:14.455 --> 49:16.355
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO KISS
YOUR BOSS.

49:16.457 --> 49:18.523
JUST DON'T FORGET
EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE

49:18.625 --> 49:20.425
TO GET HERE-- PUT YOURSELF
THROUGH SCHOOL

49:20.527 --> 49:22.227
<i>AND EVERYTHING.</i>

49:22.329 --> 49:25.096
AND YOU BETTER KEEP TAKING
THE BUS WITH ME.

49:25.198 --> 49:26.931
OH, I'M NOT GONNA RIDE
THE BUS WITH YOU ANYMORE.

49:27.033 --> 49:28.099
- I'M SORRY.
- MM-HMM.

49:28.201 --> 49:31.903
THANKS. THANK YOU.
THANKS FOR BEING MY FRIEND.

I HATE YOU.

49:40.381 --> 49:42.013
UH, PARDON ME,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

49:42.115 --> 49:45.149
<i>I'M VERY SORRY
FOR THE INCONVENIENCE HERE.</i>

49:45.252 --> 49:46.885
THIS SHOULDN'T TAKE
MORE THAN A SECOND.

49:46.987 --> 49:49.988
THERE'S SOMETHING
I REALLY NEED TO DO.

49:51.592 --> 49:54.693
LISA HARRISON,
COME HERE.

49:55.829 --> 50:00.064

SHE'S COMING.
DON'T YOU WORRY.

50:33.133 --> 50:33.965
GOTTA BE PATIENT.

50:34.067 --> 50:37.436
SHE'S ON HER WAY.

50:37.538 --> 50:39.871
HEY, DAD?

50:39.973 --> 50:41.239
YEAH, WHAT'S UP,
BUDDY?

50:41.341 --> 50:43.207
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?
YEAH, ALWAYS.

50:43.310 --> 50:45.944
IS IT OKAY THAT I LIKE IT
WHEN KATE'S AROUND?

50:46.046 --> 50:47.412
- YEAH, OF COURSE.
- [sighs]

50:47.514 --> 50:49.213
<i>WHY WOULDN'T IT BE?</i>

50:49.316 --> 50:51.015
I DON'T KNOW.

50:51.117 --> 50:54.052
MAYBE BECAUSE IT'D MAKE YOU
THINK THAT I DON'T MISS MOM.

50:55.823 --> 50:57.355
BECAUSE I DO
IN, LIKE, EVERYTHING.

50:57.458 --> 50:58.657
I KNOW YOU DO.

50:58.759 --> 51:02.260
IT'S JUST REALLY NICE
HAVING KATE WITH US NOW.

51:02.362 --> 51:03.895
[laughs]

51:03.997 --> 51:05.196
SO IT'S OKAY?

51:05.298 --> 51:07.098
PAL, IT'S MORE
THAN OKAY.

51:08.368 --> 51:09.501
YOU WANT TO KNOW
SOMETHING ELSE?

51:09.603 --> 51:10.635
WHAT?

51:10.737 --> 51:12.203
I LIKE IT
WHEN KATE'S AROUND TOO.

51:13.874 --> 51:15.707
[chuckles]

51:15.809 --> 51:16.675
HEY, THERE SHE IS.

51:16.777 --> 51:20.244
- HI.
- DON'T RUN.

51:20.347 --> 51:23.247
WOW, THIS IS THE BEST HUG
I'VE EVER GOTTEN.

51:23.350 --> 51:24.516
- REALLY?
- YES.

51:24.618 --> 51:25.984
UH, THESE ARE FOR EMILY.

51:26.086 --> 51:26.918
WOW. THEY'RE GORGEOUS.
COME ON.

51:27.020 --> 51:28.086
DAD SAVED US SEATS.

51:28.188 --> 51:29.721
- LET'S GO. HE'S EXCITED.
- OH, GREAT.

51:29.823 --> 51:32.056
- YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.
- THANKS.

51:32.158 --> 51:34.793
EMILY'S GONNA LOVE THE FLOWERS.
PINK'S HER FAVORITE.

51:42.469 --> 51:44.102
(David) SO WHAT'D YOU THINK?

51:44.204 --> 51:45.704
- SHE WAS AMAZING.
- REALLY?

51:45.806 --> 51:47.005
MM-HMM.

51:47.107 --> 51:48.640
I THOUGHT SO TOO,
BUT...

51:48.742 --> 51:49.574
THAT'S WHY I KNEW
YOU'D SAY THAT.

51:49.676 --> 51:51.109
[laughs]

51:51.211 --> 51:53.044
IT'S JUST-- SHE WANTS TO GO
TO THIS SUMMER DANCE PROGRAM.

51:53.146 --> 51:55.079
- YEAH.
- AND IT HAPPENS TO BE ABROAD.

51:55.181 --> 51:56.047
AND IT WOULD BE GOOD
FOR HER.

51:56.149 --> 51:57.448
SHE GETS A CHANCE
TO WORK

51:57.551 --> 51:58.950
WITH ALL THE TOP DANCING
COMPANIES AND EVERYTHING.

51:59.052 --> 52:01.052
I DON'T KNOW.

52:01.154 --> 52:02.053
I JUST GET NERVOUS.

52:02.155 --> 52:04.155
THAT SOUNDS INCREDIBLE
FOR HER.

52:04.257 --> 52:06.257
YEAH, I MEAN,
IT IS.

52:06.359 --> 52:09.160
IT'S JUST I DON'T KNOW
HOW HER DAD'S GONNA HANDLE IT.

52:10.898 --> 52:11.830
HEY, THERE'S EMILY.

52:13.233 --> 52:15.433
YEAH!
OH!

52:15.536 --> 52:16.535
<i>YOU DID SO WELL!</i>

52:16.637 --> 52:17.903
THANK YOU.
YOU DIDN'T FALL.

52:18.005 --> 52:18.970
I TOLD YOU
I WOULDN'T.

52:19.072 --> 52:19.938
PRACTICE PAYS OFF.

52:20.040 --> 52:20.939
SWEETHEART,
THIS IS FOR YOU.

52:21.041 --> 52:22.440
PINK ROSES?

52:22.543 --> 52:23.441
ABSOLUTELY.

52:23.544 --> 52:24.743
[laughs]

52:24.845 --> 52:25.677
YOU REMEMBERED.

52:25.779 --> 52:27.412
<i>ARE YOU KIDDING?</i>

52:27.514 --> 52:29.414
OH, THANK YOU, DADDY.
OH, I'M SO PROUD OF YOU.

52:29.516 --> 52:30.415
YOU LOOKED BEAUTIFUL
UP THERE.

52:30.517 --> 52:32.751
THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL.
THANK YOU.

52:32.853 --> 52:34.285
WELL, I DO HAVE
TO CONFESS ONE THING.

52:34.387 --> 52:35.787
KATE WAS THE ONE WHO ACTUALLY
BROUGHT THE BOUQUET.

52:35.889 --> 52:38.322
NO, ACTUALLY,
YOUR FATHER ASKED ME

52:38.425 --> 52:39.390
<i>TO PICK UP SOME FLOWERS</i>

52:39.492 --> 52:40.759
<i>FOR YOU FROM HIM.</i>

52:40.861 --> 52:41.760
AND SO THAT'S WHAT I DID.

52:41.862 --> 52:44.429
OH, HOW DID YOU KNOW?

52:44.531 --> 52:46.598
I SAW SOME PHOTOS OF YOU
FROM YOUR OTHER RECITALS,

52:46.700 --> 52:47.566
AND YOU ALWAYS HAD
PINK ROSES

52:47.668 --> 52:48.700
<i>IN YOUR HANDS,</i>

52:48.802 --> 52:50.101
<i>SO I JUST FIGURED THEY WERE
YOUR FAVORITE.</i>

52:50.203 --> 52:53.137
UH, ACTUALLY, PINK ROSES
WERE MY MOTHER'S FAVORITE.

52:53.239 --> 52:55.506
YES, BUT FOR A FEW YEARS THERE,
EMILY,

52:55.609 --> 52:56.541
<i>THEY WERE YOUR FAVORITE TOO,
SWEETIE.</i>

52:56.643 --> 52:57.642
YEAH, CAN YOU HOLD THESE
FOR A SECOND?

52:57.744 --> 52:58.577
YEAH.

52:58.679 --> 52:59.678
YOU HAVE TO MEET PAM.

52:59.780 --> 53:01.212
SHE'S SO AWESOME.

53:01.314 --> 53:02.280
GIVE ME ONE MINUTE,
OKAY?

53:06.653 --> 53:07.886
PAM, PAM.

53:07.988 --> 53:09.087
THIS IS MY DAD.

53:09.189 --> 53:10.789
HI, IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.

53:10.891 --> 53:11.756
HOW ARE YOU?
NICE TO MEET YOU.

53:11.858 --> 53:12.891
- FINALLY.
- FINALLY.

53:12.993 --> 53:13.858
GIVE ME ONE SECOND.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

53:13.961 --> 53:15.727
- EM.
- AREN'T YOU SO PROUD OF HER?

53:15.829 --> 53:16.728
SHE'S A BALLERINA
AND OUT THE DOOR.

53:16.830 --> 53:17.796
[laughs]

53:20.333 --> 53:21.866
HEY.

53:21.969 --> 53:24.435
THANKS.

53:24.537 --> 53:26.504
SO I JUST WANTED
TO SAY THANK YOU

53:26.607 --> 53:27.572
FOR COMING TONIGHT.

53:27.674 --> 53:29.507
- OH.
- IT WAS REALLY NICE OF YOU.

53:29.610 --> 53:31.142
AND FOR PICKING UP
THE FLOWERS.

53:31.244 --> 53:32.210
SURE.

53:32.312 --> 53:33.612
MY DAD WANTED ME

53:33.714 --> 53:35.246
TO TELL YOU THAT, UM,
WE'RE GOING OUT

53:35.348 --> 53:36.214
FOR A LITTLE CELEBRATION

53:36.316 --> 53:37.215
TO OUR FAVORITE RESTAURANT.

53:37.317 --> 53:38.549
OKAY, THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

53:38.652 --> 53:41.853
YEAH, IT'S KIND
OF A FAMILY TRADITION

53:41.955 --> 53:43.554
<i>AFTER I PERFORM.</i>

53:43.657 --> 53:44.623
AND PAM'S NEVER BEEN THERE,

53:44.725 --> 53:46.557
SO IT SHOULD BE
REALLY, REALLY FUN.

53:49.295 --> 53:50.962
SO HAVE A GREAT WEEKEND,
KATE.

53:52.198 --> 53:53.164
YOU TOO.

54:34.041 --> 54:34.873
- HEY.
- HI.

54:34.975 --> 54:36.741
HEY.

54:36.843 --> 54:38.076
I TRIED CALLING YOU.

54:38.178 --> 54:39.744
OH, I HAD MY PHONE OFF
DURING THE RECITAL.

54:39.846 --> 54:40.779
IS HE OKAY?

54:40.881 --> 54:43.247
YEAH, HE HAD--
HE HAD A BAD COUGHING FIT,

54:43.349 --> 54:44.716
AND HE WOULDN'T TAKE
HIS MEDICINE,

54:44.818 --> 54:46.350
AND I COULDN'T GET HIM
TO EAT ANYTHING.

54:46.452 --> 54:47.986
NOT EVEN CANDY.
I'M SORRY.

54:48.088 --> 54:49.187
THAT'S OKAY,
THANKS FOR STAYING

54:49.289 --> 54:50.121
<i>DURING YOUR DATE.</i>

54:50.223 --> 54:51.289
OH, YEAH.

54:51.391 --> 54:53.024
YOU KNOW, IT WAS ACTUALLY KIND
OF FUN TO SEE

54:53.126 --> 54:55.259
JERRY BEAT SOMEONE ELSE
AT CARDS FOR A CHANGE.

54:55.361 --> 54:57.762
I'M GONNA GO CHECK
ON HIM.

55:14.547 --> 55:15.479
HEY, DADDY.

55:17.483 --> 55:20.284
LOOK HOW PRETTY
YOU LOOK.

55:20.386 --> 55:22.420
THANKS.

55:22.522 --> 55:23.988
IT'S NOT GONNA GET YOU
OUT OF THE QUESTION.

55:24.091 --> 55:26.024
PRETTY GOOD TIME,
THOUGH, HUH?

55:26.126 --> 55:27.658
YEAH.

55:27.761 --> 55:29.894
I'M JUST TOO TIRED.

55:29.996 --> 55:33.732
I'M JUST TOO TIRED.

55:33.834 --> 55:35.433
THAT'S OKAY, DADDY.

55:35.535 --> 55:39.604
HOW DID EMILY'S
DANCE RECITAL GO?

55:39.706 --> 55:40.571
DID YOU HAVE FUN?

55:40.673 --> 55:42.640
YEAH, I HAD A GREAT TIME.

55:44.144 --> 55:46.111
I LOVE YOU, DADDY.

55:47.881 --> 55:48.847
I'M GONNA BE
RIGHT HERE.

55:48.949 --> 55:50.882
OH, I'M JUST TOO TIRED.

55:50.984 --> 55:52.583
I LOVE YOU.

56:00.260 --> 56:02.193
THANKS, CHAMP.
NO PROBLEM.

56:02.296 --> 56:04.229
NOW I GOTTA TELL YOU,
I REMEMBER IT SO CLEARLY.

56:04.331 --> 56:05.531
WATCH YOUR STEP.

56:05.633 --> 56:07.165
IT FEELS LIKE IT WAS YESTERDAY.
DAD.

56:07.267 --> 56:08.734
NO, IT ALSO FEELS
LIKE IT WAS 16 YEARS AGO.

56:08.836 --> 56:10.436
- NO LONG SPEECHES.
- OKAY.

56:10.538 --> 56:12.337
LOOK, I KNOW HOW YOU LOVE
TO HAVE

56:12.440 --> 56:14.139
A LOT OF PRESENTS
ON YOUR BIRTHDAY.

56:14.241 --> 56:15.707
AND CHRISTMAS
AND EVERY OTHER HOLIDAY,

56:15.810 --> 56:16.708
BUT THIS YEAR, I THOUGHT
IT'D BE OKAY TO GET YOU

56:16.811 --> 56:17.876
ONE PRESENT.

56:17.978 --> 56:18.911
- DAD.
- ALL RIGHT.

56:19.012 --> 56:19.945
- YOU READY?
- YES.

56:20.047 --> 56:22.648
OKAY.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, SWEETHEART.

56:22.750 --> 56:23.615
<i>AH!</i>

56:23.717 --> 56:25.484
[screams]

56:25.586 --> 56:27.118
[laughter]

56:27.220 --> 56:28.720
THANK YOU!

56:28.823 --> 56:30.288
- THANK YOU, DAD.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

56:30.390 --> 56:31.790
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

56:31.892 --> 56:32.891
GO SIT IN IT.

56:32.993 --> 56:34.192
- WHOO.
- LOOK WHAT I GOT.

56:34.294 --> 56:35.494
LOOK WHAT I GOT.
I GOT KEYS.

56:35.596 --> 56:36.628
[cackles]

56:36.730 --> 56:37.763
NOW HERE'S THE DEAL.

56:37.865 --> 56:38.764
YOU HAVE TO PAY
FOR HALF THE INSURANCE,

56:38.866 --> 56:39.932
YOU UNDERSTAND?

56:40.033 --> 56:41.266
- DAD, PLEASE...
- COME ON.

56:41.368 --> 56:42.501
YOU KNOW
THAT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.

56:42.603 --> 56:43.836
OH, YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT,
BUT IT WAS WORTH A SHOT.

56:43.938 --> 56:45.070
- OH, IT'S SO--
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

56:45.172 --> 56:46.104
I LOVE IT.

56:46.206 --> 56:47.339
<i>REALLY?</i>
I LOVE IT.

56:47.441 --> 56:48.406
WELL, GET IN. LET'S SEE WHAT IT
LOOKS LIKE ON YOU.

56:48.509 --> 56:49.508
OKAY.

56:49.610 --> 56:50.909
- CHAMP.
- UH-HUH?

56:51.011 --> 56:52.344
I THINK THAT'S GOT A SEAT
WITH YOUR NAME ON IT.

56:52.446 --> 56:53.512
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

56:53.614 --> 56:55.547
<i>(Ben)
OOH-OOH.</i>

56:58.051 --> 56:59.084
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GOING
FOR A SPIN,

56:59.186 --> 57:00.185
BUT I GOTTA GO INSIDE
FOR A SECOND, OKAY?

57:00.287 --> 57:01.653
DON'T LET HER LEAVE.

57:01.755 --> 57:02.588
(Ben)
ALL RIGHT, BUT HURRY.

57:02.690 --> 57:03.589
ALL RIGHT.
I'M COMING.

57:03.691 --> 57:04.857
BETTER HURRY.
GIVE ME TWO SECONDS.

57:04.959 --> 57:05.991
- <i>I'M ON MY WAY.</i>
- LET'S GO.

57:06.093 --> 57:07.493
YOU WANNA JUST GO?
YEAH, SURE. LET'S GO.

57:07.595 --> 57:09.695
[laughs]

57:09.797 --> 57:11.429
I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY
THAT THIS IS THE FIRST PRESENT

57:11.532 --> 57:12.798
I'VE GOTTEN MY DAUGHTER
THAT SHE MIGHT ACTUALLY LIKE.

57:15.870 --> 57:17.302
- COME ON, DAD. LET'S GO FOR A RIDE.
- YEAH.

57:17.404 --> 57:18.403
ONE SECOND, SWEETIE,
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

57:20.140 --> 57:21.206
LISTEN, I JUST--
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

57:21.308 --> 57:22.140
I MEAN,
DID I DO SOMETHING WRONG?

57:22.242 --> 57:23.241
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE

57:23.343 --> 57:25.276
I WASN'T MOVING TOO QUICKLY
THE OTHER NIGHT.

57:25.379 --> 57:26.277
'CAUSE I HAD
A WONDERFUL TIME WITH YOU.

57:26.380 --> 57:27.713
- I DID TOO.
- YOU DID?

57:27.815 --> 57:30.382
OKAY, GREAT, 'CAUSE I MEAN,
YOU JUST LEFT SO EARLY

57:30.484 --> 57:31.583
AFTER EMILY'S RECITAL
AND EVERYTHING,

57:31.685 --> 57:33.685
I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE
YOU'RE OKAY.

57:33.787 --> 57:37.956
LISTEN, UM, ALSO,
I WANTED TO ASK YOU SOMETHING.

57:38.058 --> 57:39.090
YOU KNOW, NOT TO TAKE IT
THE WRONG WAY.

57:39.192 --> 57:40.526
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
EMILY AND BEN DON'T KNOW

57:40.628 --> 57:42.528
<i>WHAT'S GOING ON BETWEEN US YET.</i>
OH, OF COURSE.

57:42.630 --> 57:43.795
AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
YOU AND I ARE ON THE SAME PAGE.

57:43.898 --> 57:45.731
YEAH, I-I THINK.

57:47.167 --> 57:49.835
I THINK I NEED
TO CHECK DINNER.

57:49.937 --> 57:52.604
<i>(Emily) DAD...</i> KATE,
WHAT I WAS--

57:52.706 --> 57:53.872
DAD, COME ON, LET'S GO!

57:53.974 --> 57:57.342
OKAY, I'M COMING.

57:57.444 --> 57:59.011
(Lisa) AS YOUR BEST FRIEND,
I FEEL LIKE IT'S MY DUTY

57:59.112 --> 58:01.513
TO TELL YOU THAT I THINK
YOU'RE OVERREACTING...

58:01.615 --> 58:02.681
WHAT?

58:02.783 --> 58:04.249
AND LOOKING TOO MUCH
INTO JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING.

58:04.351 --> 58:06.652
WAIT, SO THEY WENT OUT
AFTER THE RECITAL,

58:06.754 --> 58:07.920
I AM SAYING,
AND DIDN'T INVITE ME.

58:08.022 --> 58:09.021
YOU DON'T THINK THAT'S WEIRD?

58:09.122 --> 58:10.121
NO, IT WAS EMILY
WHO DIDN'T INVITE YOU.

58:10.223 --> 58:11.456
WELL, THAT'S TRUE,

58:11.559 --> 58:13.525
AND DAVID DID SEEM
LIKE HE WAS BUSY

58:13.627 --> 58:15.594
- <i>WITH PAM.</i>
- AND YOU LEFT.

58:15.696 --> 58:17.195
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME.

58:17.297 --> 58:18.830
I JUST, I MEAN,
YOU KNOW ME.

58:18.933 --> 58:20.832
<i>I'M THE SMART GIRL.</i>

58:20.935 --> 58:22.500
IT'S LIKE I GET
AROUND THIS GUY,

58:22.603 --> 58:24.903
AND SUDDENLY I LOSE ALL SENSE
OF NORMAL BEHAVIOR.

58:25.005 --> 58:27.238
- [sighs]
- WHAT?

58:27.340 --> 58:28.339
JUST SAY IT.
WHAT?

58:28.442 --> 58:30.075
IT'S SIMPLE.
YOU LIKE HIM.

58:30.177 --> 58:31.276
OH.

58:31.378 --> 58:32.611
BACK WHEN EVERYBODY ELSE
WAS GOING

58:32.713 --> 58:33.845
THROUGH DATING 101
IN THEIR 20s,

58:33.948 --> 58:35.413
<i>YOU WERE TAKING CARE
OF YOUR DAD.</i>

58:35.515 --> 58:36.782
<i>EVERYTHING YOU'RE FEELING</i>

58:36.884 --> 58:38.016
IS TOTALLY NORMAL.

58:38.118 --> 58:39.117
<i>YOU KNOW WHAT?</i>

58:39.219 --> 58:40.351
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

58:40.454 --> 58:41.820
THIS IS NEVER GONNA WORK.

58:41.922 --> 58:44.189
<i>WE'RE FROM TWO COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT WORLDS.</i>

58:44.291 --> 58:45.724
I RIDE THE BUS,

58:45.826 --> 58:48.060
AND HE JUST BOUGHT
HIS TEENAGE DAUGHTER

58:48.161 --> 58:50.328
<i>A LUXURY CAR.</i>

58:50.430 --> 58:52.130
I LIVE WITH MY FATHER.

58:52.232 --> 58:54.532
HE LIVES IN THIS HOUSE

58:54.635 --> 58:57.669
THAT'S THE SIZE
OF THIS APARTMENT BUILDING.

58:59.773 --> 59:01.873
HI, PAM,
IT'S EMILY.

59:01.976 --> 59:02.908
HI.

59:03.010 --> 59:04.977
LISTEN, MY DAD HAS
A LOT OF QUESTIONS

59:05.079 --> 59:06.377
ABOUT THE SUMMER DANCE PROGRAM.

59:06.480 --> 59:09.314
AND HE WAS WONDERING
IF YOU WANTED TO JOIN HIM

59:09.416 --> 59:11.817
FOR A DINNER TONIGHT.

59:11.919 --> 59:13.551
YEAH, OKAY, GREAT.

59:13.654 --> 59:14.720
TONIGHT'S OKAY?

59:14.822 --> 59:19.324
I'LL TELL HIM YOU'LL BE THERE.
BYE.

59:39.046 --> 59:40.311
UH, CHRISTINA,
CAN I CALL YOU BACK?

59:41.882 --> 59:42.881
SEE YOU AT YOUR PARTY,
HONEY.

59:42.983 --> 59:44.650
BYE, UNCLE CHRIS.
GOOD LUCK, PARTNER.

59:44.752 --> 59:46.251
GOOD LUCK?
WITH WHAT?

59:46.353 --> 59:47.552
<i>DAD, I KNOW YOU'RE REALLY BUSY,</i>

59:47.655 --> 59:49.420
BUT WE NEED TO TALK
ABOUT THE SUMMER DANCE PROGRAM.

59:49.523 --> 59:51.589
SWEETHEART, WE'VE BEEN TALKING
ABOUT THE SUMMER DANCE PROGRAM,

59:51.692 --> 59:52.924
AND WE ALSO DECIDED I NEED
A LITTLE MORE INFORMATION

59:53.027 --> 59:54.526
<i>BEFORE A DECISION IS MADE.</i>

59:54.628 --> 59:55.727
I KNOW,
AND FOR THE RECORD,

59:55.829 --> 59:56.662
I ABSOLUTELY AGREE.

59:56.764 --> 59:58.063
YOU DO?

59:58.165 --> 59:59.264
YES, OF COURSE, I DO.

59:59.366 --> 01:00:00.699
I KNOW YOU HAVE
A TON OF QUESTIONS.

01:00:00.801 --> 01:00:03.769
WHICH IS WHY IT'S SO WONDERFUL
THAT PAM HAS INVITED YOU

01:00:03.871 --> 01:00:05.037
TO THE MEETING
WITH ALL THE OTHER PARENTS

01:00:05.139 --> 01:00:05.971
TO TALK ABOUT ANY QUESTIONS

01:00:06.073 --> 01:00:07.305
<i>THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE.</i>

01:00:07.407 --> 01:00:08.807
GREAT, THEN WE'LL TALK
ABOUT YOU TRAVELING ABROAD

01:00:08.909 --> 01:00:10.976
AFTER THAT, OKAY?

01:00:11.078 --> 01:00:14.612
GREAT.
SO IT'S 7:00 AT CHAPTER 8.

01:00:14.715 --> 01:00:16.381
WELL, W-WAIT A SECOND.

01:00:16.483 --> 01:00:17.448
7:00?

01:00:17.551 --> 01:00:18.483
I ALREADY CHECKED
WITH YOUR SECRETARY,

01:00:18.585 --> 01:00:20.118
AND YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY OTHER PLANS,

01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:21.586
SO I CONFIRMED
THAT YOU'D BE THERE.

01:00:23.157 --> 01:00:25.857
UM, ALL RIGHT.

01:00:25.959 --> 01:00:26.925
<i>OKAY, I'LL BE THERE.</i>

01:00:27.027 --> 01:00:28.259
THANK YOU, DAD.

01:00:28.361 --> 01:00:29.294
I LOVE YOU.

01:00:34.668 --> 01:00:35.533
HOW'S IT GOING
OVER THERE?

01:00:35.635 --> 01:00:37.368
I'M ALMOST FINISHED.

01:00:37.470 --> 01:00:42.007
OKAY, AND I AM DONE.

01:00:42.109 --> 01:00:43.041
CAN I SEE?

01:00:43.143 --> 01:00:45.610
OKAY.

01:00:45.713 --> 01:00:50.182
LET'S SEE.

01:00:50.283 --> 01:00:51.950
<i>OH.</i>

01:00:52.052 --> 01:00:53.151
OH.

01:00:53.253 --> 01:00:54.953
<i>I DON'T KNOW</i>

01:00:55.055 --> 01:00:58.256
WHAT ELSE TO SAY,
EXCEPT THAT YOU'RE A GENIUS.

01:00:58.358 --> 01:00:59.257
YES!

01:00:59.359 --> 01:01:00.592
[laughter]

01:01:00.694 --> 01:01:02.627
WHOO!

01:01:02.730 --> 01:01:04.295
- SWEET.
- OH, MY GOODNESS.

01:01:04.397 --> 01:01:05.931
- MORE MATH LOVE?
- <i>YES.</i>

01:01:06.033 --> 01:01:07.632
AND I THINK YOU SHOULD BE
INCREDIBLY SUPPORTIVE

01:01:07.735 --> 01:01:10.035
OF YOUR BROTHER BECAUSE
HE HAS BEEN WORKING SO HARD.

01:01:10.137 --> 01:01:12.037
I AM.

01:01:12.139 --> 01:01:13.671
GOOD JOB, BEN.

01:01:13.774 --> 01:01:16.742
YOU ARE SO SMART.
OH, MY GOODNESS.

01:01:16.844 --> 01:01:19.577
HEY, KATE, UM,
IS DINNER ALMOST READY?

01:01:19.679 --> 01:01:22.114
BECAUSE, I MEAN, ALL THIS MATH
IS MAKING ME SO HUNGRY.

01:01:22.216 --> 01:01:23.715
OH, OH, I ALMOST FORGOT.

01:01:23.817 --> 01:01:25.383
IT'S JUST GONNA BE THE TWO OF US
FOR DINNER TONIGHT.

01:01:25.485 --> 01:01:28.220
MY DAD WANTED TO MEET YOU
AT THIS RESTAURANT.

01:01:28.321 --> 01:01:29.888
CHAPTER 8.
AT 7:30.

01:01:29.990 --> 01:01:31.589
AND I PROMISED HIM
I WOULDN'T FORGET,

01:01:31.691 --> 01:01:33.158
SO PLEASE DON'T TELL HIM
I ALMOST DID.

01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:35.260
OH.

01:01:35.362 --> 01:01:37.595
<i>UH, OKAY,
LET ME JUST CALL</i>

01:01:37.697 --> 01:01:39.664
AND CHECK WITH HIM ABOUT BEN.

01:01:39.767 --> 01:01:41.900
HE WAS ON HIS PHONE.

01:01:42.002 --> 01:01:43.368
THAT'S WHY HE WANTED ME
TO TELL YOU.

01:01:43.470 --> 01:01:45.170
- OKAY, DID HE SAY ANYTHING ABOUT BEN?
- I'M HERE.

01:01:45.272 --> 01:01:46.772
<i>NO DANCE CLASS
TONIGHT.</i>

01:01:46.874 --> 01:01:48.473
THAT'S PROBABLY
WHY HE WANTED TO DO IT.

01:01:49.877 --> 01:01:51.209
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE BOOK
WE'RE READING?

01:01:51.311 --> 01:01:52.710
I MEAN,
WE WERE SUPPOSED

01:01:52.813 --> 01:01:54.279
<i>TO FINISH IT TONIGHT.</i>
YOU ARE CORRECT.

01:01:54.381 --> 01:01:59.084
SO HOW ABOUT IF, AS SOON AS I AM
DONE WITH DINNER,

01:01:59.219 --> 01:02:00.318
I WILL COME BACK
TO SAY GOOD NIGHT TO YOU.

01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:01.319
OKAY, DEAL.

01:02:01.421 --> 01:02:04.089
OKAY.

01:02:08.962 --> 01:02:11.196
MR. CHANDLER.
HEY, GEORGE.

01:02:11.298 --> 01:02:12.831
THANKS.

01:02:19.572 --> 01:02:20.839
MR. CHANDLER,
HOW ARE YOU?

01:02:20.941 --> 01:02:22.107
HI, NATASHA.
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

01:02:22.209 --> 01:02:23.441
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- YOU TOO.

01:02:23.543 --> 01:02:25.576
I AM FASHIONABLY LATE,
BUT I'M ASSUMING

01:02:25.679 --> 01:02:26.778
MY PEOPLE ARE ALREADY HERE.
HI, DAVID.

01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:28.046
YES. PAM, HI.

01:02:28.148 --> 01:02:29.047
- HI.
- HOW ARE YOU?

01:02:29.149 --> 01:02:30.982
- I'M GOOD.
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

01:02:31.084 --> 01:02:31.950
WHERE IS EVERYBODY?

01:02:32.052 --> 01:02:33.551
UM...

01:02:33.653 --> 01:02:37.488
I-- I BELIEVE
THAT I'M YOUR GROUP.

01:02:37.590 --> 01:02:38.957
YOU'RE MY--
I'M SORRY, I'M NOT FOLLOWING.

01:02:39.059 --> 01:02:39.891
EMILY TOLD ME
THAT YOU WERE MEETING

01:02:39.993 --> 01:02:41.059
SOME OF THE PARENTS
TO TALK

01:02:41.161 --> 01:02:42.627
ABOUT THE SUMMER DANCE PROGRAM,
IS THAT CORRECT?

01:02:42.729 --> 01:02:44.662
UM, EMILY CALLED ME EARLIER
TO SAY

01:02:44.764 --> 01:02:45.763
THAT YOU WANTED
TO TAKE ME TO DINNER

01:02:45.866 --> 01:02:48.333
TO TALK
ABOUT THE DANCE PROGRAM.

01:02:48.435 --> 01:02:49.901
OH, PLEASE TELL ME
SHE DIDN'T DO THAT.

01:02:50.003 --> 01:02:50.902
UH-HUH.

01:02:51.004 --> 01:02:52.204
I-I'M SORRY ABOUT THIS.

01:02:52.306 --> 01:02:53.371
NO, NO, HEY, HEY.

01:02:53.473 --> 01:02:54.772
COME ON.
YOU SHOULDN'T BE SORRY.

01:02:54.875 --> 01:02:57.508
I'LL APOLOGIZE PROFUSELY
ON BEHALF OF MY DAUGHTER.

01:02:57.610 --> 01:03:00.011
UH, IT WAS REALLY NICE
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

01:03:00.113 --> 01:03:01.713
AND I AM MORE THAN HAPPY
TO SPEAK TO YOU

01:03:01.815 --> 01:03:02.981
ABOUT THE DANCE PROGRAM
SOME OTHER TIME.

01:03:03.083 --> 01:03:04.850
YOU KNOW WHAT, PAM-- PAM,
HOLD ON A SEC, HOLD ON A SEC.

01:03:04.952 --> 01:03:06.084
LET'S--

01:03:06.186 --> 01:03:07.618
NATASHA, NATASHA.

01:03:07.721 --> 01:03:08.653
YES.

01:03:08.755 --> 01:03:09.654
UM, I WAS WONDERING IF YOU HAD

01:03:09.756 --> 01:03:10.822
A TABLE FOR TWO
AVAILABLE TONIGHT?

01:03:10.924 --> 01:03:12.490
- YES.
- EXCELLENT.

01:03:12.592 --> 01:03:13.959
YOUR DAUGHTER MADE
A RESERVATION EARLIER.

01:03:14.061 --> 01:03:15.760
OH, MY DAUGHTER.
HOW APPROPRIATE.

01:03:15.863 --> 01:03:16.794
OF COURSE SHE DID.

01:03:16.897 --> 01:03:18.429
WE'LL TAKE IT.

01:03:18.531 --> 01:03:20.232
I'M ASSUMING YOU HAVEN'T EATEN
BECAUSE I'M-- I'M STARVED.

01:03:20.334 --> 01:03:21.333
[laughs]

01:03:21.434 --> 01:03:22.500
WELL, I DO MAKE IT A RULE

01:03:22.602 --> 01:03:23.902
NOT TO EAT
BEFORE NON-DATE SETUPS.

01:03:24.004 --> 01:03:25.503
YEAH, ME TOO.
IT'S A GOOD PLAN.

01:03:25.605 --> 01:03:26.537
WE SHOULD TRY THAT
NEXT TIME.

01:03:32.746 --> 01:03:33.745
WELCOME TO CHAPTER 8.

01:03:33.847 --> 01:03:35.380
- HI.
- HI, DO YOU HAVE A RESERVATION?

01:03:35.482 --> 01:03:37.448
OH, I'M MEETING
DAVID CHANDLER.

01:03:37.550 --> 01:03:39.450
SURE.
RIGHT THIS WAY.

01:04:07.842 --> 01:04:10.143
I'M AWAKE.

01:04:10.245 --> 01:04:11.111
I'M AWAKE.

01:04:11.213 --> 01:04:12.979
MM-HMM.

01:04:14.749 --> 01:04:16.583
OH.

01:04:16.685 --> 01:04:18.017
CAN WE READ SOME MORE
TONIGHT?

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:19.553
WE'LL READ TOMORROW.

01:04:19.654 --> 01:04:20.920
OKAY.
GOOD NIGHT, KATE.

01:04:21.022 --> 01:04:24.023
GOOD NIGHT.

01:04:26.428 --> 01:04:29.229
[man speaking
on television]

01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:32.732
DAD?

01:04:36.338 --> 01:04:38.605
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

01:04:38.707 --> 01:04:41.541
YOUR FATHER'S ON A DATE
WITH PAM.

01:04:41.643 --> 01:04:43.710
YOU KNOW THAT ALREADY,
DON'T YOU?

01:04:43.812 --> 01:04:44.711
WE NEED TO TALK.

01:04:44.813 --> 01:04:46.679
NO OFFENSE,
BUT I'M REALLY NOT

01:04:46.781 --> 01:04:47.614
IN THE MOOD
FOR A TALK.

01:04:47.716 --> 01:04:49.483
I'M REALLY TIRED.

01:04:49.585 --> 01:04:51.784
YEAH, WELL,
THIS WON'T TAKE VERY LONG.

01:04:51.886 --> 01:04:56.523
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW YOU HAVE HUMILIATED ME?

01:04:56.625 --> 01:04:58.625
YOUR FATHER IS ALLOWED
TO DATE PAM.

01:04:58.727 --> 01:05:00.660
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO ASK
MY PERMISSION.

01:05:00.762 --> 01:05:02.195
I KNOW THAT.

01:05:02.297 --> 01:05:04.731
AND OBVIOUSLY,
SO DOES HE.

01:05:07.402 --> 01:05:08.801
EMILY, I-I REALLY WANT YOU
TO KNOW

01:05:08.903 --> 01:05:10.637
THAT I UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.

01:05:10.739 --> 01:05:12.005
I REALLY DO.

01:05:12.107 --> 01:05:13.173
AND I'M HERE
IF YOU NEED TO TALK TO ME.

01:05:13.275 --> 01:05:14.508
ARE YOU SERIOUSLY TRYING
TO TELL ME

01:05:14.610 --> 01:05:15.475
THAT YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL?

01:05:15.577 --> 01:05:17.444
<i>BECAUSE IF YOU ARE,</i>

01:05:17.546 --> 01:05:19.346
PLEASE STOP RIGHT THERE.

01:05:19.448 --> 01:05:21.648
I AM SO SICK AND TIRED
OF PEOPLE TELLING ME

01:05:21.750 --> 01:05:24.117
THAT THEY UNDERSTAND,
THAT THEY KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE.

01:05:24.219 --> 01:05:25.952
<i>NO ONE KNOWS.</i>

01:05:26.054 --> 01:05:27.120
I KNOW.

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:33.293
I CAN TELL YOU THIS
FOR SURE.

01:05:33.395 --> 01:05:36.896
<i>NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS
IN YOUR LIFE</i>

01:05:36.998 --> 01:05:38.765
<i>AND HOW HORRIBLE
IT FEELS,</i>

01:05:38.867 --> 01:05:44.137
EVEN IF YOU JUST TRY TO KEEP
THE FAITH, IT DOES START

01:05:44.239 --> 01:05:46.105
<i>TO GET BETTER
EVENTUALLY.</i>

01:05:46.208 --> 01:05:47.106
<i>I PROMISE.</i>

01:05:47.209 --> 01:05:49.176
YOU WANT ME
TO KEEP THE FAITH

01:05:49.278 --> 01:05:51.545
WHEN I CAN'T FIND ANY
TO BEGIN WITH?

01:05:53.315 --> 01:05:56.316
[phone rings]

01:05:56.418 --> 01:05:57.217
PHONE'S RINGING.

01:05:57.319 --> 01:05:59.986
I KNOW.

01:06:00.088 --> 01:06:01.954
I'M-- OH, I HAVE
TO TAKE THIS.

01:06:04.726 --> 01:06:05.692
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

01:06:14.636 --> 01:06:16.936
JERRY HEWITT'S ROOM, PLEASE.

01:06:17.038 --> 01:06:19.072
RIGHT THERE.

01:06:27.683 --> 01:06:28.548
EXCUSE ME.

01:06:28.650 --> 01:06:29.982
[breathes]

01:06:30.085 --> 01:06:32.752
- HI, DADDY.
- KATIE GIRL.

01:06:32.854 --> 01:06:33.820
DO YOU NEED ANYTHING?

01:06:33.922 --> 01:06:36.189
UH, NO.

01:06:36.291 --> 01:06:37.724
I HAVE EVERYTHING
I NEED.

01:06:37.826 --> 01:06:39.926
DID YOU LEAVE WORK
TO COME HERE?

01:06:40.028 --> 01:06:41.695
YEAH.

01:06:41.796 --> 01:06:43.796
YEAH, AND IT'S A GOOD THING,
DADDY,

01:06:43.898 --> 01:06:47.701
'CAUSE IF I'DA STAYED THERE,
I WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE

01:06:47.802 --> 01:06:50.270
FOR WHAT I WANTED TO DO
TO THAT CHILD.

01:06:50.372 --> 01:06:53.172
EMILY IS HORRID
AND ATROCIOUS.

01:06:53.275 --> 01:06:56.643
I SEEM TO REMEMBER
A YOUNG GIRL

01:06:56.745 --> 01:06:57.910
THAT ACTED OUT
JUST LIKE THAT.

01:06:58.012 --> 01:06:59.946
I WASN'T AS BAD
AS THAT.

01:07:00.048 --> 01:07:01.781
I BEG TO DIFFER.

01:07:01.883 --> 01:07:04.584
THERE WAS SOME PRETTY
STELLAR MOMENTS.

01:07:04.686 --> 01:07:06.453
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

01:07:06.555 --> 01:07:08.788
I'M GONNA CALL DAVID TOMORROW,

01:07:08.890 --> 01:07:10.257
AND I'M GONNA TELL HIM
THAT I NEED SOME TIME OFF.

01:07:10.359 --> 01:07:13.192
YOU'LL DO NOTHING
OF THE KIND.

01:07:13.295 --> 01:07:15.328
YOU'LL CONTINUE WORKING
WITH THIS FAMILY,

01:07:15.430 --> 01:07:17.196
AND YOU'LL KEEP GOING
TO SCHOOL,

01:07:17.299 --> 01:07:18.565
AND YOU'LL GET
YOUR TEACHER'S DEGREE.

01:07:18.667 --> 01:07:20.800
AND YOU'LL LET YOURSELF
FALL IN LOVE

01:07:20.902 --> 01:07:21.801
AND HAVE
A MAGNIFICENT LIFE.

01:07:21.903 --> 01:07:24.337
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO TALK LIKE THAT.

01:07:24.439 --> 01:07:25.838
OKAY, WE DON'T NEED TO TALK
ABOUT ANYTHING.

01:07:25.940 --> 01:07:26.873
YES, WE DO.

01:07:26.975 --> 01:07:30.176
YOU WERE BROUGHT
INTO THIS FAMILY'S LIFE

01:07:30.279 --> 01:07:31.444
<i>FOR A REASON.</i>

01:07:31.546 --> 01:07:33.146
<i>YES, THEY NEED YOU.</i>

01:07:33.248 --> 01:07:34.147
<i>BUT WHETHER OR NOT
YOU KNOW IT,</i>

01:07:34.249 --> 01:07:36.316
YOU NEED THEM TOO,
KATIE GIRL.

01:07:36.418 --> 01:07:38.718
DADDY, I DON'T THINK
THIS FAMILY NEEDS ME.

01:07:38.820 --> 01:07:41.454
DON'T YOU--

01:07:41.556 --> 01:07:42.855
DON'T YOU GIVE UP
ON THIS GIRL.

01:07:42.957 --> 01:07:47.093
<i>YOU DON'T REALIZE
THAT SHE NEEDS YOU.</i>

01:07:47.195 --> 01:07:48.361
<i>NOW MORE THAN EVER.</i>

01:07:48.463 --> 01:07:51.765
SHE DOESN'T KNOW IT YET,

01:07:51.866 --> 01:07:53.433
BUT YOU'RE GONNA BRING HER
AROUND.

01:07:53.535 --> 01:07:56.703
<i>ONE DAY,
YOU'LL FIND A WAY.</i>

01:07:56.805 --> 01:07:59.872
I DON'T KNOW
IF I'LL BE ABLE TO DO THAT.

01:07:59.974 --> 01:08:02.074
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

01:08:02.177 --> 01:08:03.743
I HAVE ENOUGH FAITH
FOR BOTH OF US.

01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:32.604
HI, DADDY.

01:08:32.707 --> 01:08:33.606
HOW WAS YOUR NIGHT?

01:08:33.709 --> 01:08:34.674
WE NEED TO HAVE

01:20:30.592 --> 01:20:31.958
[sighs]

01:20:32.060 --> 01:20:34.527
<i>DAD?</i>

01:20:34.629 --> 01:20:35.762
HEY, SWEETIE.

01:20:35.864 --> 01:20:37.597
<i>HEY.</i>

01:20:37.699 --> 01:20:39.632

01:20:39.735 --> 01:20:42.268

01:20:42.371 --> 01:20:44.170

THE DANCE PROGRAM THIS SUMMER.

01:20:44.272 --> 01:20:46.573
OKAY.

01:20:46.675 --> 01:20:48.575
I JUST THINK IT'D BE BETTER

01:20:48.677 --> 01:20:50.677
TO HELP YOU WITH BEN.

01:20:50.779 --> 01:20:53.179
OKAY.

01:20:53.281 --> 01:20:55.682
DO YOU MIND TELLING ME
WHAT BROUGHT THIS ON?

01:20:55.784 --> 01:20:59.318
I'VE JUST BEEN THINKING
ABOUT SOME THINGS.

01:20:59.421 --> 01:21:03.590
<i>THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN
REALLY BOTHERING ME.</i>

01:21:03.692 --> 01:21:08.227
DAD, I KNOW WHAT I'M ABOUT TO
SAY IS GONNA REALLY UPSET YOU,

01:21:08.329 --> 01:21:10.697
BUT I HOPE--
I REALLY HOPE--

01:21:10.799 --> 01:21:13.867
THAT SOMEDAY YOU'LL
BE ABLE TO FORGIVE ME.

01:21:19.073 --> 01:21:25.412
[indistinct chatter]

01:21:25.514 --> 01:21:28.080
SO YESTERDAY WE TALKED ABOUT
OUR FAVORITE BOOKS,

01:21:28.182 --> 01:21:33.252
AND TODAY WE ARE GOING
TO DISCUSS FAIRY TALES.

01:21:33.354 --> 01:21:39.158
<i>AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
FAIRY TALES IN BOOKS</i>

01:21:39.260 --> 01:21:43.663
AND...LIFE.

01:21:43.765 --> 01:21:45.398
OKAY, SO WHEN WE'RE
READING A BOOK--

01:21:45.500 --> 01:21:47.901
WE'RE READING
A FAIRY TALE IN A BOOK,

01:21:48.002 --> 01:21:48.935
HOW DOES IT USUALLY BEGIN?

01:21:49.037 --> 01:21:51.671
(all)
ONCE UPON A TIME.

01:21:51.773 --> 01:21:52.872
THAT'S RIGHT.

01:21:52.974 --> 01:21:55.007
AND HOW DO FAIRY TALES
USUALLY END IN BOOKS?

01:21:55.109 --> 01:21:57.644
(all)
HAPPILY EVER AFTER.

01:21:57.746 --> 01:22:00.379
<i>VERY GOOD.
THAT'S RIGHT.</i>

01:22:00.482 --> 01:22:02.816
NOW, IN REAL LIFE SOME--

01:22:02.918 --> 01:22:04.851

01:22:04.953 --> 01:22:06.553

01:22:09.825 --> 01:22:11.123

01:22:11.225 --> 01:22:14.727

01:22:17.566 --> 01:22:21.200
UH, I MISS YOU.

01:22:30.946 --> 01:22:33.245

WHAT TO SAY.

01:22:33.348 --> 01:22:35.314

01:22:38.453 --> 01:22:40.119
