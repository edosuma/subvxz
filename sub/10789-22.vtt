WEBVTT

00:01.500 --> 00:02.917
Joey:
IT'S TRUE WHAT THEY SAY.

00:02.917 --> 00:05.125
TIME PLAYS TRICKS ON YOU.

00:05.125 --> 00:07.333
MEMORY IS
AN UNRELIABLE NARRATOR.

00:07.333 --> 00:11.125
HISTORY GETS REWRITTEN
IN SMALL WAYS
WITH EACH PASSING DAY.

00:11.125 --> 00:13.291
I CAN'T SWEAR THIS IS
EXACTLY HOW IT HAPPENED,

00:13.291 --> 00:15.417
BUT THIS IS HOW IT FELT.

00:59.041 --> 01:00.375
Joey: SUMMER
HAD BROUGHT US HOME,

01:00.375 --> 01:02.375
AND WE WASTED NO TIME
ASSUMING OUR ROLES

01:02.375 --> 01:05.959
IN WHAT HAD BECOME
AN ALL-TOO-FAMILIAR
SCENARIO.

01:12.375 --> 01:16.250
PACEY HAD FALLEN FROM GRACE,
DAWSON'S DREAMS WERE DASHED,

01:16.250 --> 01:19.291
AND I WAS SOMEHOW
IN THE MIDDLE OF IT
ALL OVER AGAIN.

01:22.041 --> 01:24.208
THE TRIANGLE
WE HAD ALL TRIED
SO HARD TO PUT TO REST

01:24.208 --> 01:26.917
HAD COME BACK TO HAUNT US.

01:31.542 --> 01:32.750
NEED SOME HELP?

01:35.083 --> 01:36.708
YOU SCARED
THE CRAP OUT OF ME.

01:36.708 --> 01:37.708
WUSS.

01:37.708 --> 01:38.750
WHAT ARE
YOU DOING?

01:38.750 --> 01:41.208
IT'S CALLED
SYMBOLIC PURGING.

01:41.208 --> 01:42.458
I CAN'T STAND
TO HAVE THIS STUFF
AROUND ANYMORE.

01:42.458 --> 01:43.875
IT JUST SITS HERE
MOCKING ME.

01:43.875 --> 01:45.875
I THOUGHT
I WAS THE ARTIST.

01:45.875 --> 01:47.625
THAT--

01:48.792 --> 01:50.291
UM, FINE,
LAUGH ALL YOU WANT,

01:50.291 --> 01:52.208
BUT THAT'S THE WHOLE
MOVIE RIGHT THERE,
SHOT BY SHOT.

01:52.208 --> 01:53.708
WELL, THEN I WOULDN'T
BE THROWING IT AWAY
IF I WERE YOU.

01:53.708 --> 01:55.000
YOU'RE GONNA NEED THIS.

01:57.542 --> 02:00.708
DAWSON, YOU HAVE THE CHANCE
TO DO SOMETHING GREAT HERE,

02:00.708 --> 02:02.208
AND I CAN'T LET YOU
PASS THAT UP.

02:02.208 --> 02:04.250
I'VE BEEN AUTHORIZED
TO USE FORCE IF NECESSARY.

02:04.250 --> 02:06.625
HAPPEN TO BRING
YOUR $18,000 WITH YOU?

02:08.041 --> 02:09.250
NO, I FORGOT THAT.

02:09.250 --> 02:10.625
JO, YOU'RE SWEET,
I APPRECIATE IT,

02:10.625 --> 02:12.333
BUT I HAVE NO MONEY.

02:12.333 --> 02:14.583
ZERO. NOT ONLY THAT,
I'M IN DEBT.

02:14.583 --> 02:15.583
THANKS TO YOUR
FRIEND AND MINE,

02:15.583 --> 02:16.500
I CHARGED UP
ALL MY CREDIT CARDS.

02:16.500 --> 02:17.333
I'M GONNA HAVE TO WORK
DOUBLES AT FRESH FISH

02:17.333 --> 02:19.417
ALL THIS SUMMER
JUST TO PAY THEM OFF.

02:19.417 --> 02:20.500
SO...

02:20.500 --> 02:23.458
STOP BY AND SAY HI
SOMETIME.

02:23.458 --> 02:27.291
DAWSON LEERY, YOU ARE GOING
TO LET ALL THESE DETAILS
GET IN THE WAY?

02:27.291 --> 02:28.625
WOULD THEY STOP SPIELBERG?

02:28.625 --> 02:30.417
I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T
RECALL ANYTHING IN HIS BIO

02:30.417 --> 02:31.834
ABOUT HIS BEST FRIEND
SQUANDERING
ALL OF HIS MONEY.

02:34.333 --> 02:37.959
PACEY MESSED UP.
NO ONE'S DENYING THAT.

02:37.959 --> 02:39.750
BUT IT WASN'T
INTENTIONAL, DAWSON.

02:39.750 --> 02:41.792
IT NEVER IS, JO.

02:41.792 --> 02:44.333
NEVER IS, BUT IT HAPPENS
EVERY SINGLE TIME,

02:44.333 --> 02:47.125
AND I DON'T NEED IT
ANYMORE. IT'S...

02:47.125 --> 02:48.500
WHAT?

02:48.500 --> 02:49.542
IT WHAT?

02:49.542 --> 02:53.625
NOTHING.
IT'S JUST...

02:53.625 --> 02:56.291
SOME THINGS
NEVER CHANGE.

02:56.291 --> 02:57.333
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE TAKING
HIS SIDE ON THIS.

02:57.333 --> 02:58.667
I'M NOT.

02:58.667 --> 03:01.000
I'M NOT TAKING
ANYONE'S SIDE,
DAWSON.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.500
LOOK,
I LOVED YOUR SCRIPT.

03:03.500 --> 03:05.333
IT WAS REAL.
IT WAS THE TRUTH.

03:05.333 --> 03:09.834
IT MAKES EVERYTHING
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH
SEEM SOMEHOW WORTH IT.

03:09.834 --> 03:12.834
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU AND PACEY CAN'T
JUST PUT YOUR HEADS TOGETHER

03:12.834 --> 03:14.667
AND FIGURE SOMETHING OUT.

03:14.667 --> 03:16.625
LOOK I REFUSE TO BELIEVE
IT HAS TO END THIS WAY.

03:16.625 --> 03:18.041
WELL, BELIEVE IT, JO,
'CAUSE I PRETTY MUCH

03:18.041 --> 03:19.667
NEVER WANT TO SEE THE GUY
AS LONG AS I LIVE.

03:19.667 --> 03:21.375
YOU KNOW WHAT? I KNOW
YOU DON'T MEAN THAT.

03:21.375 --> 03:22.458
YEAH, I DO.

03:22.458 --> 03:23.708
IF YOU GIVE UP NOW,
YOU HAVE NOTHING

03:23.708 --> 03:25.000
AND IT WAS
ALL JUST A WASTE.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.667
IT WAS A WASTE
EITHER WAY.

03:26.667 --> 03:28.500
JO, LOOK, WE CAN GO
BACK AND FORTH FOR HOURS

03:28.500 --> 03:30.542
ON WHY IT'S VIRTUALLY
IMPOSSIBLE FOR ME
TO MAKE THIS FILM,

03:30.542 --> 03:33.041
BUT THE REAL REASON IS
I DON'T BELIEVE IN IT
ANYMORE.

03:33.041 --> 03:34.875
I DON'T.

03:34.875 --> 03:38.375
THE SCRIPT
WAS A CELEBRATION
OF FRIENDSHIP,

03:38.375 --> 03:41.041
SOME GOLDEN ERA
THAT PROBABLY ONLY
EVER EXISTED IN MY HEAD,

03:41.041 --> 03:42.583
AND I SOMEHOW DELUDED
MYSELF INTO BELIEVING

03:42.583 --> 03:44.250
THAT IT WAS A STORY
OF US, OF ALL OF US,

03:44.250 --> 03:47.041
AND THAT
IT SHOULD BE TOLD.

03:47.041 --> 03:48.500
AND I DON'T
BELIEVE THAT ANYMORE.

03:48.500 --> 03:50.708
WELL, FORTUNATELY FOR YOU,
I KNOW YOU DON'T MEAN THAT.

03:50.708 --> 03:53.917
LOOK, YOU'RE HURT,
YOU'RE PISSED OFF,
YOU WANT TO GIVE UP,

03:53.917 --> 03:55.375
WHICH IS TOTALLY
UNDERSTANDABLE,

03:55.375 --> 03:57.875
BUT IT SUCKS
FOR YOU RIGHT NOW

03:57.875 --> 04:00.041
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT
DEALING WITH SOMEBODY
WHO'S GOING TO LET YOU.

04:00.041 --> 04:03.542
SO I'M GOING TO LEAVE YOU
TO YOUR SULKING FOR NOW,

04:03.542 --> 04:05.708
BUT I'LL BE BACK.

04:05.708 --> 04:07.875
AND I PROMISE YOU
IT'S NOT GONNA BE PRETTY.

04:07.875 --> 04:10.708
ASSES WILL BE KICKED,
NAMES WILL BE TAKEN.

04:10.708 --> 04:14.333
UNTIL THEN,
BYE-BYE, OLD CHUM.

05:12.834 --> 05:14.291
OK, IS EVERYONE CLEAR?

05:14.291 --> 05:15.583
DOES EVERYONE UNDERSTAND
THEIR ASSIGNMENTS?

05:15.583 --> 05:16.500
WHAT ABOUT ME?
WHAT CAN I DO?

05:16.500 --> 05:17.583
ANYTHING. ANYTHING AT ALL
TO DISTRACT ME

05:17.583 --> 05:19.542
FROM THE SHEER HELLISH
BOREDOM OF SUMMER SCHOOL.

05:19.542 --> 05:22.208
PAGE 12.

05:23.458 --> 05:25.125
MISS JACOBS?
THAT'S RIGHT.

05:25.125 --> 05:26.625
THE OLD BROAD?

05:26.625 --> 05:28.333
THE ONE AND THE SAME.
WHAT ABOUT HER?

05:28.333 --> 05:30.625
WELL, I'M YANKING YOU
OUT OF EARLY RETIREMENT

05:30.625 --> 05:32.291
TO BRING HER LIFE
TO THE SCREEN.

05:32.291 --> 05:34.750
WAIT A SECOND.
LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

05:34.750 --> 05:36.750
YOU WANT ME
TO PLAY THE SLUTTY TEACHER

05:36.750 --> 05:39.333
THAT--THAT ROBBED PACEY
OF HIS DELICATE FLOWER?

05:39.333 --> 05:41.542
DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH THAT?

05:41.542 --> 05:43.000
YOU COULD PLAY EVE.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.000
SADLY, EVE
DIDN'T MAKE THE CUT.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.000
AW, THAT'S A SHAME.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.250
WHO THE HELL IS EVE?

05:46.250 --> 05:48.208
EH, LONG STORY.
AMBIGUOUS ENDING.

05:48.208 --> 05:49.333
NOW WHAT ABOUT PACEY?
OH, YEAH.

05:49.333 --> 05:50.959
GUESS HE COULDN'T MAKE IT.

05:50.959 --> 05:52.417
BUT DON'T WORRY.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF THAT.

05:52.417 --> 05:53.375
(SIGHS)

05:53.375 --> 05:54.667
HEY, JOEY.
DOUGIE,

05:54.667 --> 05:56.166
WHERE IS HE?

05:56.166 --> 05:59.000
THE LITTLE BROTHER?
OH, HE'S, UM, OUT

05:59.000 --> 06:00.834
OR SOMETHING.

06:00.834 --> 06:03.041
LIAR, LIAR.
TSK, TSK, DOUGIE.

06:03.041 --> 06:05.708
I'M WARNING YOU, JOEY,
IT'S UGLY.

06:05.708 --> 06:08.708
Pacey: HEY. JO, COME IN.

06:08.708 --> 06:11.000
I'M FINALLY STARTING
TO UNDERSTAND
THESE SOAP OPERAS.

06:11.000 --> 06:14.375
THEY'RE
PRETTY GOOD.

06:14.375 --> 06:15.834
ALL RIGHT, DIRT MERCHANT.

06:15.834 --> 06:17.208
PUT SOME PANTS ON.
YOU'RE COMING WITH.

06:17.208 --> 06:20.000
YEAH.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.917
I DON'T THINK I'M GOING
TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT.

06:21.917 --> 06:24.000
THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS
IS JUST ABOUT TO COME ON.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.875
I GOTTA SEE HOW J.T. TALKS
HIS WAY OUT OF THIS ONE

06:26.875 --> 06:28.500
'CAUSE COLLEEN
WAS ABOUT TO KILL HIM.

06:28.500 --> 06:30.875
I WOULDN'T MISS THAT FOR
ALL THE PIZZA IN CAPESIDE.

06:30.875 --> 06:32.041
BUT, PLEASE, FEEL FREE.

06:32.041 --> 06:33.583
PULL UP A SEAT.
WE GOT CHIPS.

06:33.583 --> 06:34.792
PACEY.

06:37.250 --> 06:38.583
THIS IS PATHETIC.

06:38.583 --> 06:45.125
WELL, YEAH. KIND OF
COMES WITH THE TERRITORY.

06:45.125 --> 06:46.667
NOW I'M NOT SURE WHAT
YOU WANT ME TO DO ABOUT IT.

06:46.667 --> 06:48.500
I WANT YOU
TO COME WITH ME.

06:48.500 --> 06:49.875
I WANT YOU
TO HELP ME FIGURE OUT

06:49.875 --> 06:52.667
HOW TO GET DAWSON'S MOVIE
MADE ON $10 AND A DREAM.

06:52.667 --> 06:54.250
I'D JUST END UP RUINING
THE WHOLE THING,

06:54.250 --> 06:56.500
AND DAWSON KNOWS THAT,
I KNOW THAT,

06:56.500 --> 06:58.083
AND IN YOUR HEART
OF HEARTS YOU KNOW THAT.

06:58.083 --> 06:59.875
I'M A DANGEROUS MAN,

06:59.875 --> 07:02.667
A LETHAL WEAPON,

07:02.667 --> 07:07.959
SO WE'RE ALL BETTER OFF
IF I JUST LAY HERE
ON MY COUCH,

07:07.959 --> 07:09.458
WATCHING MY STORIES.

07:12.583 --> 07:14.834
UHH!

07:14.834 --> 07:16.750
PACEY!
WHAT?

07:16.750 --> 07:19.417
LOOK.

07:19.417 --> 07:23.041
I NEED YOU.
DAWSON NEEDS YOU.

07:23.041 --> 07:24.792
OK. HERE'S
THE MOST CRUCIAL THING

07:24.792 --> 07:25.708
THAT YOU'RE
GOING TO HAVE TO GET

07:25.708 --> 07:26.750
THROUGH THAT PRETTY
LITTLE HEAD OF YOURS.

07:26.750 --> 07:30.208
THINGS WILL NEVER BE
THE SAME BETWEEN
DAWSON AND ME.

07:32.083 --> 07:34.125
OR ANY OF US
FOR THAT MATTER.

07:34.125 --> 07:35.917
AND YOU'RE JUST GOING
TO HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT.

07:35.917 --> 07:39.417
I DON'T.

07:39.417 --> 07:41.083
AND I NEVER WILL.

07:43.583 --> 07:46.542
OK. THAT'S FINE.

07:46.542 --> 07:50.708
BE CHEERY AND DELIGHTFUL
AND WHATEVER ELSE IT IS
YOU WANT TO BE.

07:50.708 --> 07:52.250
I REALLY DON'T CARE.

07:59.959 --> 08:01.166
YEAH, BEFORE YOU GO--

08:04.333 --> 08:06.083
(PACEY GROANS)

08:09.792 --> 08:11.500
(DOOR SLAMS)

08:21.792 --> 08:23.250
YOU ARE SO BUSTED.

08:23.250 --> 08:25.166
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

08:25.166 --> 08:26.792
IS THIS HIM?
THAT'S HIM.

08:26.792 --> 08:28.792
THAT'S IT, HARLEY.
I'M GONNA HAVE
TO TELL YOUR FATHER.

08:28.792 --> 08:30.291
TELL HIM WHAT?

08:30.291 --> 08:32.000
HE KNOWS PATRICK AND I
ARE SEEING EACH OTHER.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.207
BUT WOULD HE LIKE TO KNOW
ABOUT THIS LITTLE BIT
OF UNPLEASANTNESS?

08:33.207 --> 08:34.375
I THINK NOT.

08:34.375 --> 08:36.792
WELL, I'M NOT
GONNA TELL HETSON,

08:36.792 --> 08:38.958
WHICH IS GOOD FOR YOU

08:38.958 --> 08:40.667
BECAUSE HE WOULD LIKE
TO HAVE WIPED THE FLOOR
WITH YOUR PUNK ASS,

08:40.667 --> 08:42.500
BUT NOW IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU TWO OWE ME A FAVOR.

08:42.500 --> 08:45.041
NO.

08:45.041 --> 08:47.875
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
THIS IS A GREAT FILM.

08:47.875 --> 08:51.458
YOU WOULD BE DOING THE WORLD
OF INDEPENDENT CINEMA
A HUGE FAVOR.

08:51.458 --> 08:53.000
I DON'T KNOW.
LET ME READ THE SCRIPT.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.000
THERE'S NO TIME.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.208
YEAH, WELL, UH, I GUESS

08:55.208 --> 08:57.166
YOU'RE OUT OF LUCK, THEN.
BYE-BYE.

08:57.166 --> 09:00.083
OK, LOOK, I REALLY
DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE
TO DO THIS,

09:00.083 --> 09:01.959
BUT IT APPEARS AS THOUGH
I HAVE NO CHOICE.

09:01.959 --> 09:05.375
UM, I'LL
GO OUT WITH YOU.

09:05.375 --> 09:06.708
WHAT?
I'LL GO OUT WITH YOU.

09:06.708 --> 09:07.542
IT'S WHAT YOU WANT, RIGHT?

09:07.542 --> 09:10.375
BUT JUST COFFEE, OK?
NO FUNNY BUSINESS.

09:10.375 --> 09:13.750
YEAH. THANKS FOR THAT,
BUT I'M NOT REALLY
INTERESTED.

09:13.750 --> 09:17.208
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
I'M A FILM GEEK'S DREAM.

09:17.208 --> 09:19.667
NOT THIS FILM GEEK.

09:19.667 --> 09:21.333
HOW YOU DOIN'?

09:39.041 --> 09:40.250
OH, HEY, SWEETIE.
HEY.

09:40.250 --> 09:41.500
CAN I FIX YOU
SOME DINNER?

09:41.500 --> 09:43.083
NO, THANKS.
I'M JUST GONNA TAKE A NAP

09:43.083 --> 09:44.917
BEFORE THE DINNER SHIFT.

09:44.917 --> 09:47.792
SWEET DREAMS.

09:54.917 --> 09:56.041
TOLD YOU
I'D BE BACK.

09:56.041 --> 09:57.583
HOW--HOW DID--

09:57.583 --> 09:58.750
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

09:58.750 --> 10:00.417
I JUST WANT YOU
TO ADMIT HERE AND NOW,

10:00.417 --> 10:03.792
ONCE AND FOR ALL, THAT
YOU FINALLY HAVE NO EXCUSES.

10:03.792 --> 10:05.417
WELL, WHAT ABOUT ACTORS?

10:05.417 --> 10:06.291
LEARNING THEIR LINES
AS WE SPEAK.

10:06.291 --> 10:08.792
AWAITING A PHONE CALL
FROM THEIR DIRECTOR.

10:08.792 --> 10:11.417
OOH. I GET TO PLAY
MISS JACOBS.

10:11.417 --> 10:15.542
YOU KNOW, THE WOMAN
WHO SEDUCES A YOUNG BOY
ON THE VERGE OF MANHOOD.

10:15.542 --> 10:17.625
I DO HAVE SOME NOTES,
HOWEVER.

10:17.625 --> 10:19.375
LATER. WE'LL DIS--
WE'LL DISCUSS IT LATER.

10:19.375 --> 10:20.583
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY,
DAWSON,

10:20.583 --> 10:21.875
ARE YOU READY
TO TAKE OFF THE DRESS

10:21.875 --> 10:23.041
AND STEP UP
TO THE PLATE?

10:23.041 --> 10:25.417
YEAH, DAWSON,
YOU HAVE NO IDEA

10:25.417 --> 10:28.625
WHAT I WENT THROUGH
TO GET THIS STUFF.

10:28.625 --> 10:31.917
GUYS, IT'S AMAZING.
AND THIS IS--

10:31.917 --> 10:33.458
I'M TOUCHED
BEYOND WORDS, BUT--

10:33.458 --> 10:36.125
BUT? NO.
THERE ARE NO BUTS, DAWSON.

10:36.125 --> 10:38.125
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO
IS SHOOT THE MOVIE,

10:38.125 --> 10:40.291
JUST LIKE YOU WERE
GOING TO DO A WEEK AGO.

10:40.291 --> 10:42.500
AND IF YOU'RE TELLING ME
THAT YOU DON'T BELIEVE
IN FRIENDSHIP ANYMORE,

10:42.500 --> 10:45.959
I AM GOING TO THROW YOU
OUT THAT WINDOW.

10:45.959 --> 10:49.125
N-NO, IT'S NOT THAT.
I MEAN, I HAVE TO WORK.
I HAVE A JOB.

10:49.125 --> 10:51.291
OH, NO, YOU DON'T.

10:51.291 --> 10:52.291
YOU'RE FIRED.

10:52.291 --> 10:53.291
WHAT?

10:53.291 --> 10:54.291
IT'S MY RESTAURANT,
DAWSON.

10:54.291 --> 10:55.834
I'M FIRING YOU.
CASE CLOSED.

10:55.834 --> 10:57.625
MOM--
OK, SO HERE'S
WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO.

10:57.625 --> 11:00.375
YOU'RE GONNA
POP THE CHAMPAGNE,

11:00.375 --> 11:02.417
YOU'RE GOING TO POUR IT
INTO THESE SILLY
LITTLE CUPS

11:02.417 --> 11:03.959
BECAUSE THAT'S
ALL I COULD FIND,

11:03.959 --> 11:06.166
AND THEN YOU ARE
GOING TO MAKE A TOAST

11:06.166 --> 11:09.458
TO STARTING PRODUCTION
ON YOUR NEW FILM.

11:09.458 --> 11:11.291
AND I'D PROBABLY THROW IN
A LITTLE SOMETHING

11:11.291 --> 11:14.667
ABOUT YOUR FRIENDS HERE
WHO, IN MY OPINION,
ARE FAIRLY AMAZING

11:14.667 --> 11:18.417
AND DON'T FORGET
TO MENTION YOUR MOTHER.

11:23.208 --> 11:27.208
WHAT CAN I SAY?

11:27.208 --> 11:28.792
LET'S DO THIS THING.

11:28.792 --> 11:29.959
YES.

11:31.166 --> 11:32.667
YAY.

11:32.667 --> 11:35.125
(CHEERING)

11:35.125 --> 11:36.625
I KNOW.

11:44.166 --> 11:45.834
Joey:
WHAT DO WE THINK?

11:45.834 --> 11:47.625
I THINK WE SHOULD GIVE HIM
ANOTHER 5 MINUTES

11:47.625 --> 11:49.500
AND TRY AND TIME OUT
THIS BIKE THING PERFECTLY.

11:49.500 --> 11:51.250
AND THEN WE'LL
HAVE HIM JUST WALK
INTO THE VIDEO STORE?

11:51.250 --> 11:53.000
I GUESS SO. YEAH.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.750
IT'S NOTHING LIKE
ASKING THE DIRECTOR
TO COMPROMISE

11:54.750 --> 11:56.708
BEFORE HE'S EVEN GOTTEN
HIS FIRST SHOT OFF.

11:56.708 --> 11:59.333
HEY, JEN, UM,
RIGHT AFTER THIS,

11:59.333 --> 12:00.917
WE HAVE TO GO
INSIDE THE VIDEO STORE

12:00.917 --> 12:02.542
AND SHOOT IN THERE,
AND WE ONLY HAVE
A LIMITED TIME IN THERE,

12:02.542 --> 12:05.667
SO PLEASE TELL ME
THEY KNOW THEIR LINES.

12:05.667 --> 12:07.583
THEY KNOW THEIR LINES.

12:07.583 --> 12:09.083
THEY JUST DON'T KNOW
WHAT ORDER THEY GO IN.

12:15.083 --> 12:16.708
WHAT, NO SPRINKLES?

12:16.708 --> 12:17.875
KIDDING.

12:17.875 --> 12:20.083
ANY WORD ON
OUR SPECIAL DELIVERY?

12:20.083 --> 12:20.917
IN TRANSIT.

12:20.917 --> 12:24.250
OK, WHY DO I NOT SMELL
EGGS FLORENTINE?

12:24.250 --> 12:25.542
Pacey: EXCUSE ME?

12:25.542 --> 12:27.083
I THOUGHT
WE HAD AN AGREEMENT.

12:27.083 --> 12:28.500
I LET YOU
CRASH ON MY COUCH,

12:28.500 --> 12:30.500
YOU COOK FOR ME.

12:30.500 --> 12:31.917
ELABORATE,
MOUTH-WATERING,

12:31.917 --> 12:34.792
PROFESSIONALLY PREPARED
MEALS, WELL GARNISHED.

12:34.792 --> 12:36.875
I'M REALLY FLATTERED
BY YOUR FAITH IN
MY CULINARY ABILITIES,

12:36.875 --> 12:37.917
BUT I CAN'T DO IT TODAY.

12:37.917 --> 12:39.625
I GOT OTHER THINGS
TO DO,

12:39.625 --> 12:41.083
BUT I LEFT ALL
THE FIXINGS OUT FOR YOU,

12:41.083 --> 12:41.917
AND YOU REALLY DO
OWE IT TO YOURSELF

12:41.917 --> 12:43.917
AS A MODERN BACHELOR
TO DEVELOP SOME SORT

12:43.917 --> 12:45.500
OF RUDIMENTARY
COOKING SKILLS.

12:45.500 --> 12:49.208
AND CHICKS
DIG THAT KIND OF THING.

12:49.208 --> 12:51.959
AND, YOU KNOW,
THOSE OTHER GUYS, TOO.
THEY LIKE IT.

12:55.041 --> 12:56.750
MY GOD,
LOOK AT THAT.

12:56.750 --> 12:58.708
OH, SHOW
SOME RESPECT, MAN.

12:58.708 --> 13:00.708
SHE'S OLD ENOUGH
TO BE SOMEBODY'S MOTHER.

13:00.708 --> 13:02.750
YEAH, A ZYGOTE'S.

13:02.750 --> 13:04.583
BESIDES, I HAPPEN TO HAVE IT
ON PRETTY GOOD AUTHORITY

13:04.583 --> 13:07.291
THAT MOTHERS HAVE
EXCELLENT SEX LIVES.

13:08.959 --> 13:10.750
GOOD AFTERNOON.
CAN WE HELP YOU?

13:10.750 --> 13:12.125
UM, YEAH--
Dawson: CUT, CUT.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.667
AUDREY, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO TAKE THE ROBE OFF.

13:13.667 --> 13:14.667
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

13:14.667 --> 13:15.625
I THOUGHT
WE'D BE IN TIGHT ENOUGH

13:15.625 --> 13:16.792
SO WE WOULDN'T SEE IT,
BUT IT'S RIGHT THERE.

13:16.792 --> 13:18.583
THIS IS,
LIKE, MY DREAM DAY.

13:18.583 --> 13:21.458
OK, DAWSON,
WHAT IF I JUST SHOW
A LITTLE SHOULDER?

13:21.458 --> 13:22.750
I NEED BARE SKIN.

13:22.750 --> 13:23.959
Jen: YOU NEED, LIKE,
SPAGHETTI STRAPS.

13:23.959 --> 13:24.959
SHE'S RIGHT. YOU
HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING

13:24.959 --> 13:26.792
TO MATCH THE WARDROBE
AUDREY WOULD BE WEARING

13:26.792 --> 13:28.291
IF PACEY JUNIOR HADN'T
WALKED INTO HER CHEST

13:28.291 --> 13:29.333
WITH A JELLY DOUGHNUT.

13:29.333 --> 13:30.792
WE DON'T HAVE
AN E.T.A. ON THAT
DRESS YET, DO WE?

13:30.792 --> 13:32.125
YES. SPIN CYCLE.
YOUR MOM SAYS

13:32.125 --> 13:33.625
IT'S GONNA BE ABOUT,
UH, 20 MINUTES.

13:33.625 --> 13:35.959
UH, EXCUSE ME.
IS THERE ANY SCENARIO

13:35.959 --> 13:37.625
IN WHICH SHE
COULD JUST TAKE OFF
ALL HER CLOTHES?

13:37.625 --> 13:39.333
YOU KNOW,
AT LEAST FOR ONE TAKE?

13:39.333 --> 13:41.959
BECAUSE THEN, YOU KNOW,
I FEEL LIKE I COULD
REALLY GIVE YOU

13:41.959 --> 13:44.291
AN APPROPRIATE
ON-CAMERA REACT--AAH!

13:44.291 --> 13:47.041
CAN I HAVE 5 MINUTES
ALONE WITH THIS GUY?

13:47.041 --> 13:50.083
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW LONG
I DREAMED OF HEARING
YOU SAY THAT. OW!

13:53.166 --> 13:54.834
WHAT?
NOTHING.

13:54.834 --> 13:57.792
OK, GEORGE,
KEEP DOING EXACTLY
WHAT YOU'VE BEEN DOING.

13:57.792 --> 13:59.208
GUYS WILL BE GOING
A LITTLE BIT TIGHTER
NEXT TIME,

13:59.208 --> 14:02.041
AND, AUDREY, IF YOU CAN
JUST LOWER THE ROBE DOWN
JUST ABOVE YOUR ELBOWS.

14:02.041 --> 14:04.750
PATRICK, I KNOW
YOU GOT IT IN YOU
TO IMAGINE THE REST.

14:06.333 --> 14:09.333
THINK OF HOW MANY MORE
PATIENTS YOU WOULD HAVE

14:09.333 --> 14:11.959
IF YOU SEIZED UPON THIS
WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY
FOR FREE PUBLICITY.

14:11.959 --> 14:15.000
IF I HAVE TO GIVE YOU
$200, HOW IS IT FREE?

14:15.000 --> 14:19.208
THIS YOU WILL GET BACK
WITH A CREDIT IN THE FILM.

14:19.208 --> 14:23.667
A VERY SPECIAL THANKS
TO DR. ELICE BRISCOE,
THE FRIENDLY DENTIST.

14:23.667 --> 14:27.458
THE DENTIST WHO CARES
ABOUT PEOPLE'S DREAMS,
I MEAN, THINK OF IT.

14:27.458 --> 14:29.959
AND LOOK AT THAT SMILE.

14:29.959 --> 14:33.000
IT'S A CRIME TO KEEP YOU
BEHIND THIS DESK.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.667
WOULD YOU DO US
THE HONOR OF PERHAPS

14:34.667 --> 14:36.500
COMING IN AND DOING
A LITTLE CAMEO IN THE FILM?

14:36.500 --> 14:37.500
Joey:
UH, DAWSON--

14:37.500 --> 14:38.375
HEY, JACK,
CAN WE USE THAT BELL?

14:38.375 --> 14:39.375
YEAH, DONE.

14:39.375 --> 14:41.375
GREAT. SORRY. WHAT?

14:41.375 --> 14:43.375
WELL, I JUST THINK
WITH THE LIGHT STREAMING
THROUGH THE WINDOW,

14:43.375 --> 14:45.166
WE'RE TOTALLY GOING
TO BE ABLE TO SEE
THROUGH AUDREY'S DRESS.

14:45.166 --> 14:46.834
HA HA! I KNOW.

14:46.834 --> 14:48.375
YOU KNOW?
YES.

14:48.375 --> 14:49.708
THAT'S THE NATURAL
LIGHTING EFFECT

14:49.708 --> 14:50.875
I'VE BEEN WAITING
ALL DAY TO GET.

14:50.875 --> 14:52.333
THAT'S WHY I DIDN'T DO
THE WIDE SHOT FIRST.

14:52.333 --> 14:54.542
SO IS THIS
GONNA WORK OR WHAT?

14:54.542 --> 14:56.667
THAT IS PERFECTION.
SHE KNOWS?

14:56.667 --> 14:58.333
YEAH, OF COURSE
SHE KNOWS.

14:58.333 --> 14:59.542
I'M NOT GONNA DO
SOMETHING LIKE THAT
WITHOUT ASKING HER FIRST.

14:59.542 --> 15:01.667
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS KID
DOING TO MY STORE?

15:01.667 --> 15:03.083
HE'S NOT DOING ANYTHING.
I TOLD YOU

15:03.083 --> 15:04.917
WE WILL PUT EVERYTHING BACK
EXACTLY AS WE FOUND IT.

15:04.917 --> 15:06.542
YOU ALSO TOLD ME YOU
WOULDN'T BREAK ANYTHING

15:06.542 --> 15:08.083
AND THAT YOU'D
BE OUT OF HERE BY 2:00.

15:08.083 --> 15:09.667
Doug: HEY, JOEY,
I JUST WANTED
TO LET YOU TO KNOW

15:09.667 --> 15:11.583
I CAN'T BLOCK THAT STREET
ANYMORE. IT'S ALMOST 5:00.

15:11.583 --> 15:13.041
OH, THANK GOD, THE LAW.

15:13.041 --> 15:14.667
OFFICER, CAN YOU GET
THESE KIDS OUT OF MY STORE?

15:14.667 --> 15:16.041
IS THERE A PROBLEM
HERE, JOEY?

15:16.041 --> 15:17.291
NO. YOU KNOW WHAT?
THERE'S NO PROBLEM.

15:17.291 --> 15:21.500
LOOK, I UNDERSTAND
THAT WE'RE GOING LONGER
THAN WE ANTICIPATED,

15:21.500 --> 15:24.792
AND I APPRECIATE
SO MUCH THAT YOU'RE
LETTING US BE HERE,

15:24.792 --> 15:26.708
BUT WE JUST NEED--
IT'S FRIDAY.

15:26.708 --> 15:29.625
DO YOU KNOW WHAT PEOPLE DO
ON A FRIDAY NIGHT?

15:29.625 --> 15:31.500
RENT VIDEOS.
EXACTLY,

15:31.500 --> 15:34.750
WHICH IS WHY I WANT THEM
OUT OF HERE NOW.

15:34.750 --> 15:35.792
WE NEED
10 MORE MINUTES.

15:35.792 --> 15:36.708
YOU KNOW WHAT, SIR?

15:36.708 --> 15:39.291
WHY DON'T WE, UM,
TALK ABOUT THIS OUTSIDE?

15:40.417 --> 15:41.959
THANK YOU.

15:43.875 --> 15:45.250
OK. SO NOW
WHAT DO WE DO?

15:45.250 --> 15:47.291
WE SHOOT QUICKLY WHILE
DOUG HAS THE GUY DISTRACTED.

15:47.291 --> 15:48.417
AND IF
IT DOESN'T WORK?

15:48.417 --> 15:50.625
UH, BRIBERY.

15:50.625 --> 15:51.959
DAWSON, WE DON'T
HAVE ANY MONEY.

15:51.959 --> 15:53.417
NO, BUT WE DO HAVE
AN ABUNDANCE OF HOT GIRLS,

15:53.417 --> 15:55.250
WHICH ARE
AS GOOD AS CURRENCY
IN MANY COUNTRIES.

15:55.250 --> 15:57.250
YOU'RE JOKING.

15:57.250 --> 15:58.417
YOU'RE JOKING
AT A TIME LIKE THIS?

15:58.417 --> 16:01.125
DAWSON,
WE HAVE YET TO
FINISH THIS SCENE,

16:01.125 --> 16:03.583
WE'RE LOSING
THE LIGHT, WE'RE
LOSING THE LOCATION.

16:03.583 --> 16:07.000
HEY, WITHOUT CHAOS,
THERE'D BE NO HAPPY ACCIDENTS.

16:09.083 --> 16:10.792
Todd: HELLO, HELLO,
HELLO, HELLO.

16:11.875 --> 16:13.583
WHY ARE WE NOT
FILMING HERE, LEERY?

16:13.583 --> 16:15.583
THE LIGHT IS PERFECT.

16:15.583 --> 16:18.917
THE LEADING LADY
IS PERFECT.

16:18.917 --> 16:20.959
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

16:20.959 --> 16:23.917
WELL, THAT SEXY MOM
OF YOURS

16:23.917 --> 16:25.291
MADE ME AN OFFER
I COULDN'T REFUSE.

16:25.291 --> 16:28.917
HA HA! ALL I DID WAS
E-MAIL HIM THE SCRIPT.

16:28.917 --> 16:31.291
IT TOOK ME 2 DAYS
TO BLOODY DOWNLOAD THE THING.

16:31.291 --> 16:33.834
BUT WHEN I DID,
I SAID THIS IS BRILLIANT.

16:33.834 --> 16:36.125
I SAID THIS IS
JUST THE SORT OF PROJECT

16:36.125 --> 16:37.625
THAT TODD NEEDS
TO BE INVOLVED WITH.

16:37.625 --> 16:39.792
SO I'M HERE, FULLY
ON BOARD, READY TO WORK

16:39.792 --> 16:42.291
IN WHATEVER MENIAL CAPACITY
YOU MAY REQUIRE ME.

16:42.291 --> 16:44.000
I COULD REALLY USE A D.P.
DONE.

16:44.000 --> 16:44.917
AND A CAMERA OPERATOR.

16:44.917 --> 16:46.458
DONE AGAIN. JUST GET ME
A TRIPLE ESPRESSO

16:46.458 --> 16:47.500
AND I'M GOOD TO GO.
GOT IT.

16:47.500 --> 16:50.667
UM, TODD,
I'M THE DIRECTOR NOW.

16:50.667 --> 16:55.000
RIGHT YOU ARE, AND
A DAMN GOOD ONE, TOO.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.834
UM...

17:03.333 --> 17:05.000
I'LL GO.
Gale: OH, JOEY.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.750
DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT IT.
BUT--

17:08.625 --> 17:10.165
ALL RIGHT,
LISTEN UP PEOPLE.

17:10.165 --> 17:14.375
CHOP, CHOP. THIS MAN HERE
HAS A MOVIE TO MAKE,

17:14.375 --> 17:17.791
AND WE ARE GONNA MAKE IT
FOR HIM OR DIE TRYING.

17:17.791 --> 17:21.375
(APPLAUSE)

17:24.165 --> 17:25.208
SO LET ME
GET THIS STRAIGHT.

17:25.208 --> 17:27.458
YOU'VE DEVELOPED SOME SORT
OF SUPERSTITIOUS BELIEF

17:27.458 --> 17:28.708
THAT IF YOU EAT
STEAMED BROCCOLI EVERY DAY,

17:28.708 --> 17:30.208
YOU'LL NEVER DIE?

17:30.208 --> 17:33.083
EXACTLY.

17:33.083 --> 17:34.542
WELL, YOU SEE THE PROBLEM
IS, SWEETHEART,

17:34.542 --> 17:37.750
IS THESE ARE HUGE,
GIGANTIC PIECES OF BROCCOLI.

17:37.750 --> 17:40.208
I'M LOOKING FOR MORE
OF A BROCCOLINI-TYPE DEAL.

17:40.208 --> 17:41.333
A BROCCOLINI?

17:41.333 --> 17:44.208
EXACTLY.

17:44.208 --> 17:45.667
WELL, OFF YOU GO THERE.

17:56.667 --> 17:59.959
YOU KNOW, IN CALIFORNIA,
THIS IS REALLY A VERY
REASONABLE REQUEST.

18:09.458 --> 18:11.083
NO WAY.
NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

18:11.083 --> 18:12.291
NOT IN A MILLION YEARS.

18:12.291 --> 18:14.458
I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND
YOUR CONCERN. I REALLY DO,

18:14.458 --> 18:16.542
BUT IT'S AN INCREDIBLY
CHARACTER-DEFINING MOMENT

18:16.542 --> 18:18.542
NOT JUST FOR YOU.
FOR ALL 3 CHARACTERS,
EXPLAINS YOUR DYNAMIC.

18:18.542 --> 18:20.583
I SAID NOT HAPPENING.

18:23.750 --> 18:25.583
WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

18:25.583 --> 18:27.959
SHE CAN'T SWIM.
SHE--

18:35.125 --> 18:37.208
EW, NO THANKS.
I'M TRYING TO QUIT.

18:37.208 --> 18:38.792
NO, IT'S NOT TO EAT.

18:38.792 --> 18:40.917
I NEED YOU TO CHOP THIS UP
AND SERVE IT TO TODD.

18:40.917 --> 18:42.959
YOU ARE HIS NEW
PERSONAL ASSISTANT.

18:42.959 --> 18:43.750
I'VE BEEN WRAPPED
FOR THE DAY.

18:43.750 --> 18:44.750
CAN'T YOU FIND
SOMEONE ELSE TO DO IT?

18:44.750 --> 18:46.625
SOMEONE WHO'S NOT
NUMBER ONE ON THE CALL SHEET?

18:46.625 --> 18:48.875
NO. COME ON. GET UP.

18:48.875 --> 18:50.959
THERE ARE DIVAS OUT THERE
MORE IMPOSSIBLE THAN YOU

18:50.959 --> 18:52.625
WHO REQUIRE
OUR IMMEDIATE ATTENTION.

18:52.625 --> 18:56.000
OH! FINE!
THANK YOU.

18:57.959 --> 19:01.000
OK.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.458
HEY, HEY, HEY,
GET OUT OF HERE!

19:02.458 --> 19:04.208
(GROWLS)

19:05.250 --> 19:06.959
(GROWLS)

19:06.959 --> 19:08.959
AAH!

19:08.959 --> 19:11.041
(GROWLS)

19:11.792 --> 19:14.000
AND CUT!

19:14.000 --> 19:15.542
GREAT! WE GOT IT.

19:15.542 --> 19:17.792
OH, COME ON.
IT'S JUST A SMALL DONATION.

19:17.792 --> 19:18.625
YOU'RE SURE
I'M NOT A LESBIAN?

19:18.625 --> 19:19.959
YES, I'M SURE.

19:19.959 --> 19:21.834
I MEAN, IT WOULD
EXPLAIN A LOT.

19:21.834 --> 19:24.750
OTHERWISE, WHY DO I
HATE THIS NEXT-DOOR
NEIGHBOR GIRL SO MUCH?

19:24.750 --> 19:26.291
AND WHY WOULD
I RATHER HANG OUT

19:26.291 --> 19:29.041
WITH THIS ASEXUAL
FILM DORK INSTEAD
OF GO TO FRANCE?

19:29.041 --> 19:32.667
BECAUSE MAYBE YOU'RE
NOT READY TO GO TO FRANCE.

19:32.667 --> 19:35.041
MAYBE AS MUCH AS YOU HATE
TO ADMIT IT TO YOURSELF,

19:35.041 --> 19:37.834
YOU HAD A SUCKY CHILDHOOD
AND YOU STILL HAVE
A LOT OF GROWING UP TO DO.

19:37.834 --> 19:41.125
HE MUST HAVE BEEN
A REALLY GOOD KISSER,
THE GAY GUY.

19:41.125 --> 19:43.917
YOU HAVEN'T LISTENED
TO ONE WORD THAT I'VE SAID.

19:46.875 --> 19:48.333
HAVE YOU WORKED
IN A RESTAURANT BEFORE?

19:48.333 --> 19:50.125
YEAH, I WORKED
A KITCHEN UP IN BOSTON.

19:50.125 --> 19:52.250
I ACTUALLY
STUDIED UNDER ONE OF
THE BEST COOKS UP THERE,

19:52.250 --> 19:54.792
BUT NOW I GUESS
I'M JUST DOING THIS.

19:54.792 --> 19:56.333
WHICH IS
WHAT EXACTLY?

19:56.333 --> 19:59.917
HONESTLY? I'M JUST
HELPING OUT A FRIEND.

20:01.667 --> 20:04.834
YOU KNOW WHAT?
DON'T GO ANY PLACE.

20:04.834 --> 20:06.125
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK
WITH YOUR CHANGE.

20:08.667 --> 20:11.667
HI.
HI.

20:11.667 --> 20:13.041
YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME,
DO YOU?

20:15.041 --> 20:17.041
NO, BUT I REALLY
WISH I DID.

20:19.000 --> 20:22.000
WELL, YOU SURE CHANGED
YOUR PITCH A LOT
SINCE THIS MORNING.

20:22.000 --> 20:25.208
THE RECEPTIONIST
FROM THE DENTIST'S OFFICE,
OF COURSE. I'M SORRY.

20:25.208 --> 20:28.834
NO, NO. YOU REALLY
DON'T REMEMBER ME.

20:28.834 --> 20:31.708
OH, COME ON.
FROM HIGH SCHOOL?

20:31.708 --> 20:35.166
I MEAN, IT'S KIND
OF A BLOW TO MY EGO.

20:35.166 --> 20:37.875
YOU USED TO FOLLOW ME
AROUND EVERYWHERE.

20:37.875 --> 20:41.000
IT WAS KIND
OF PATHETIC, BUT...

20:41.000 --> 20:43.333
NOW HERE WE ARE
5 YEARS LATER

20:43.333 --> 20:46.166
AND IT'S LIKE YOU DON'T
EVEN KNOW WHO I AM.

20:46.166 --> 20:48.583
HERE YOU GO, CHRISTY.

20:48.583 --> 20:50.667
THANKS. NICE
SEEING YOU, PACEY.

20:52.250 --> 20:54.041
CHRISTY?
YEAH, YEAH,
CHRISTY LIVINGSTONE.

20:54.041 --> 20:54.959
CHRISTY!

21:07.041 --> 21:08.250

THE KITCHEN WINDOW

21:08.250 --> 21:10.917
CERTAINLY
ARE AN EYESORE.

21:10.917 --> 21:12.875
DON'T KNOW
HOW GALE CAN BEAR
LOOKING AT THEM.

21:14.750 --> 21:18.500
I'LL BE SURE TO ALERT
THE INTERIOR DECORATING POLICE.

21:21.708 --> 21:23.375
HOW YA DOIN'?

21:23.375 --> 21:27.041
SITTIN' UP HERE ON THE PORCH
WATCHIN' EVERYBODY.

21:27.041 --> 21:29.542
IT'S VERY NICE
SEEING ALL YOU CHILDREN

21:29.542 --> 21:30.875
TOGETHER AGAIN

21:30.875 --> 21:34.458
HAVING ONE FUN
LAST DAY IN CAPESIDE.

21:34.458 --> 21:37.917
ONE LAST DAY, PLEASE.

21:37.917 --> 21:39.750
(SIGHS)

21:39.750 --> 21:42.125
I'M SURE THAT THIS
ISN'T GONNA BE ANYONE'S
LAST DAY IN CAPESIDE,

21:42.125 --> 21:43.834
I MEAN, I'M SURE
THAT WE'LL ALL HAVE REASONS

21:43.834 --> 21:46.625
TO COME BACK HERE,
YOU KNOW, AND--AND WE'RE
JUST MOVING TO NEW YORK.

21:46.625 --> 21:48.583
IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE--

21:48.583 --> 21:51.000
DYING.

21:51.000 --> 21:53.625
THAT'S RIGHT.
WE'RE NOT.

21:53.625 --> 21:57.333
WE'RE JUST BEGINNING
ONE MORE CHAPTER

21:57.333 --> 21:59.750
IN OUR LIVES
TOGETHER.

21:59.750 --> 22:03.834
A VERY NICE
LONG ONE.

22:09.375 --> 22:10.792
(SIGHS)

22:10.792 --> 22:13.041
DO YOU MISS THIS PLACE?

22:13.041 --> 22:15.500
OH...EVERY DAY.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.667
DO I REGRET
LEAVING IT?

22:17.667 --> 22:19.000
NEVER.

22:24.875 --> 22:25.917
HI.

22:25.917 --> 22:28.417
HEY, DAWSON.

22:28.417 --> 22:29.500
HOW YOU GUYS DOIN'?

22:29.500 --> 22:31.667
WHEW. GOOD.
WE'RE GOOD.

22:31.667 --> 22:32.959
COULDN'T BE BETTER.

22:32.959 --> 22:34.625
GOOD. I HATE
TO INTERRUPT,

22:34.625 --> 22:35.625
BUT--

22:35.625 --> 22:36.875
CAB'S HERE.

22:36.875 --> 22:39.041
NO, ACTUALLY, IT'S
JUST THAT YOU'RE, UH,

22:39.041 --> 22:40.959
WELL, YOU'RE...

22:40.959 --> 22:42.542
KINDA IN MY SHOT.

22:42.542 --> 22:43.834
OH.
OH.

22:43.834 --> 22:44.667
(LAUGHS)
OH, WELL.

22:44.667 --> 22:46.834
I CAN'T THINK
OF A MORE APPROPRIATE WAY

22:46.834 --> 22:49.458
TO SAY GOOD-BYE TO OUR OLD
NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR, CAN YOU?

22:49.458 --> 22:51.834
FRANK CAPRA
OF CAPESIDE?

22:51.834 --> 22:53.375
NO. COME HERE.

23:55.750 --> 23:57.208
Jack: SEE YA.

24:02.417 --> 24:03.417
Audrey: BYE.

24:03.417 --> 24:04.583
Gale: BYE-BYE.

24:04.583 --> 24:05.750
Joey: WE LOVE YOU.

24:05.750 --> 24:07.000
Audrey: BYE.

24:12.708 --> 24:14.750
BYE.

24:14.750 --> 24:16.417
WE LOVE YOU.

24:16.417 --> 24:17.875
WOW. THEY'RE REALLY
NEVER LEAVING, ARE THEY?

24:17.875 --> 24:18.875
I DON'T THINK SO.

24:18.875 --> 24:19.875
BYE!

24:19.875 --> 24:21.125
Joey: BYE.

24:21.125 --> 24:23.291
Audrey:
MISS YOU, CUTIES!

24:31.291 --> 24:33.291
WHAT IS THIS FEELING?

24:34.792 --> 24:36.000
(SIGHS)

24:36.000 --> 24:37.000
IT JUST SEEMS
LIKE EVERYTHING'S

24:37.000 --> 24:38.458
GETTING
SMALLER AND SMALLER.

24:38.458 --> 24:39.458
IT'S ALL STILL THERE,

24:39.458 --> 24:42.125
BUT I JUST
CAN'T TOUCH IT.

24:43.375 --> 24:46.333
I THINK IT'S
CALLED GOOD-BYE.

24:54.291 --> 24:56.333
(LAUGHING)

25:09.542 --> 25:10.542
(ENGINE STARTS)

25:19.375 --> 25:20.458
THE TRUTH? OF COURSE
I'M TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

25:20.458 --> 25:21.959
WHY WOULD I LIE
ABOUT THESE THINGS?

25:21.959 --> 25:23.166
PACEY WITTER,

25:23.166 --> 25:26.083
BAD-ASS STUD
AND MAN ABOUT TOWN?

25:26.083 --> 25:28.708
OK, YOU'RE RIGHT,
I WOULD LIE
ABOUT THOSE THINGS,

25:28.708 --> 25:30.792
BUT I DID SAIL
AROUND THE CARIBBEAN,
AND FOR A WHILE THERE,

25:30.792 --> 25:32.458
I ACTUALLY
DID OWN A BMW.

25:32.458 --> 25:34.625
I PROMISE YOU, THAT
IS THE GOSPEL TRUTH.

25:34.625 --> 25:36.166
I SEE.

25:36.166 --> 25:38.667
SO NOW AFTER
MUCH SOUL-SEARCHING,

25:38.667 --> 25:41.333
YOU'VE COME BACK
RIGHT TO WHERE YOU STARTED.

25:41.333 --> 25:43.041
WELL, COME ON,

25:43.041 --> 25:45.333
I'M NOT EXACTLY
RIGHT WHERE I STARTED.

25:45.333 --> 25:46.708
I'M TALKIN' TO YOU,
AREN'T I?

25:46.708 --> 25:48.708
YEAH.

25:48.708 --> 25:50.083
YEAH, YOU ARE.

25:50.083 --> 25:52.208
OR YOU WERE.

25:52.208 --> 25:54.708
I WA--OH, NO,
YOU'RE LEAVING?

25:54.708 --> 25:56.375
I'M SORRY.
I--I HAVE TO GO.

25:56.375 --> 25:57.583
I SHOULD'VE
LEFT AGES AGO,

25:57.583 --> 25:59.375
BUT, UM...

25:59.375 --> 26:00.375
(SIGHS)

26:00.375 --> 26:01.875
YOU CAN CALL ME.

26:01.875 --> 26:02.875
REALLY?

26:02.875 --> 26:03.875
YOU SHOULD...

26:03.875 --> 26:05.208
CALL ME.

26:05.208 --> 26:07.208
HERE.

26:07.208 --> 26:09.417
I WILL,
ABSOLUTELY WILL.

26:09.417 --> 26:10.417
BYE, PACEY.

26:10.417 --> 26:12.875
GOOD-BYE,
CHRISTY.

26:12.875 --> 26:14.750
HA HA.

26:16.375 --> 26:17.834
WASN'T THAT--

26:17.834 --> 26:19.708
CHRISTY LIVINGSTONE,
YES, IT WAS.

26:19.708 --> 26:20.750
TALKING TO YOU?

26:20.750 --> 26:22.041
TALKIN' TO ME.

26:22.041 --> 26:23.041
IN FACT,
FLIRTING WITH ME.

26:23.041 --> 26:23.750
SHE GAVE ME
HER PHONE NUMBER.

26:23.750 --> 26:25.708
(LAUGHS)

26:25.708 --> 26:27.291
(SIGHS)

26:27.291 --> 26:28.750
YOU KNOW WHAT
THIS MEANS, RIGHT?

26:28.750 --> 26:30.250
YOU KNOW, CHRISTY,
SHE'S LIKE, UH--

26:30.250 --> 26:31.667
METAPHOR, I KNOW.

26:31.667 --> 26:32.542
SHE REPRESENTS ALL
OF THE HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS

26:32.542 --> 26:33.875
YOU THOUGHT YOU'D
NEVER BE ABLE TO HAVE

26:33.875 --> 26:35.083
BECAUSE
YOU WERE SUCH A LOSER.

26:35.083 --> 26:36.291
EXACTLY.

26:36.291 --> 26:39.458
AND THE FACT THAT
ALL THE NORMAL GIRLS

26:39.458 --> 26:41.250
WHO HAVEN'T BEEN
SURGICALLY ENHANCED--

26:41.250 --> 26:44.959
GIRLS LIKE ME AND JEN
AND AUDREY AND ANDIE--

26:44.959 --> 26:46.625
THE FACT THAT WE'VE SPENT
EVERY SECOND OF THE PAST 5 YEARS

26:46.625 --> 26:48.250
TELLING YOU THAT
YOU WEREN'T A LOSER,

26:48.250 --> 26:49.708
THAT MEANS NOTHING TO YOU.

26:49.708 --> 26:52.250
I-I'M SORRY, YOU LOST ME
THERE IN THE MIDDLE.

26:52.250 --> 26:54.458
MAYBE I SHOULD
EXPLAIN THE WHOLE
METAPHOR THING AGAIN.

26:54.458 --> 26:56.083
WHY AM I EVEN
TALKING TO YOU?

26:56.083 --> 26:59.750
HI. UM, I'M HERE
TO PICK UP A TO-GO ORDER.

26:59.750 --> 27:00.917
THE NAME'S POTTER.

27:00.917 --> 27:01.792
RIGHT. RIGHT.
COMING RIGHT UP.

27:01.792 --> 27:03.000
THANK YOU.

27:06.041 --> 27:07.166
SO HOW'S IT GOING?

27:08.667 --> 27:10.291
HOW'S WHAT GOING?

27:10.291 --> 27:12.333
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M TALKIN' ABOUT.

27:13.792 --> 27:15.625
WELL,
IT'S NOT TOO LATE

27:15.625 --> 27:17.542
FOR YOU TO FIND OUT
FOR YOURSELF.

27:18.333 --> 27:20.083
WELL, YEAH,
BUT IF I DID THAT,

27:20.083 --> 27:22.417
THEN I'D HAVE TO EAT
ALL THOSE FINE WORDS
I SAID THE OTHER DAY,

27:22.417 --> 27:23.500
AND I ACTUALLY
BELIEVE THEM.

27:23.500 --> 27:26.750
SO, WHAT I WAS HOPING
WAS THAT, INSTEAD,

27:26.750 --> 27:28.500
YOU COULD JUST
TAKE THIS TO DAWSON.

27:35.125 --> 27:36.625
IT'S NOT EVERYTHING,

27:36.625 --> 27:39.125
BUT IT'S EVERYTHING THAT
I COULD GET IN ONE DAY,

27:39.125 --> 27:42.667
AND I'LL GET THE REST
WHENEVER I GET THE REST.

27:42.667 --> 27:44.000
BUT WHAT I WAS HOPING IS
THAT YOU WOULD TAKE THAT

27:44.000 --> 27:45.458
TO HIM AND THEN...

27:45.458 --> 27:47.792
TELL HIM
I SAID CONGRATULATIONS

27:47.792 --> 27:50.625
AND ALL THAT GOOD STUFF.

27:57.834 --> 27:59.375
I COULD.

27:59.375 --> 28:00.834
ALL RIGHT.

28:02.000 --> 28:03.417
BUT I WON'T.

28:06.041 --> 28:08.291
'CAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT,
PACE, YOU WERE RIGHT.

28:09.500 --> 28:11.583
THIS ISN'T MY FIGHT.

28:12.834 --> 28:16.166
YOU KNOW,
NEVER HAS BEEN AND...

28:16.166 --> 28:18.417
IT NEVER WILL BE.

28:19.625 --> 28:21.500
SO, WHAT,
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,

28:21.500 --> 28:23.375
YOU'RE JUST
GONNA WASH YOUR HANDS
OF THE BOTH OF US?

28:26.959 --> 28:29.000
I'M GONNA TRY.

28:37.625 --> 28:39.625
TAKE CARE.

28:46.708 --> 28:48.959
OK.

28:54.166 --> 28:55.708
WE'RE FRIENDS, OK?

28:55.708 --> 28:58.208

AND WE DON'T TALK
ABOUT THIS AGAIN. DEAL?

29:04.417 --> 29:06.250
YOU GOT IT.

29:06.250 --> 29:09.625
WHY'D YOU HAVE
TO BRING THIS UP ANYWAY?

29:12.083 --> 29:13.542
AND CUT. PERFECT.

29:13.542 --> 29:16.625
EVERYBODY, THANK YOU
FOR A TERRIFIC FIRST DAY.

29:16.625 --> 29:18.959
THAT'S A WRAP.
I'LL SEE YOU ALL TOMORROW.

29:18.959 --> 29:20.417

JUST CALL ME A HOOKER?

30:09.291 --> 30:11.417
WHAT? I MEANT IT
IN A GOOD WAY.

30:12.625 --> 30:13.625

COME TO THINK OF IT,

30:19.333 --> 30:20.792
GO ON, YOU KNOW
YOU WANT TO.

30:20.792 --> 30:22.625
COME ON,
GIVE A GEEZER A RUB.

30:22.625 --> 30:26.625

ALL VERY CHARMING.

30:46.792 --> 30:48.291
(LAUGHS)

30:52.834 --> 30:53.959
OK.

31:01.500 --> 31:02.625
(SIGHS)

31:02.625 --> 31:04.166
(GROANS)

31:05.291 --> 31:07.000
OH, THAT'S GOOD.

31:08.083 --> 31:10.917
TOO GOOD...ACTUALLY.

31:12.291 --> 31:14.125
MIGHT MAKE A BLOKE
WANNA INVITE A BIRD

31:14.125 --> 31:16.834
UP TO HIS ROOM
FOR A NIGHTCAP.

31:18.125 --> 31:19.625
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

31:23.000 --> 31:24.000
ABSOLUTELY.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.417
(LAUGHS)

31:29.875 --> 31:31.583
(GIGGLING)

31:56.708 --> 31:58.542
(SIGHS)

32:02.250 --> 32:04.291
Joey: HEY.

32:04.291 --> 32:08.125
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU
STILL DOIN' HERE?

32:08.125 --> 32:11.083
MM, I THOUGHT
I'D STICK AROUND
TO CONGRATULATE YOU.

32:11.083 --> 32:12.959
(LAUGHS)

32:12.959 --> 32:15.792
YOU WERE GREAT TODAY.

32:15.792 --> 32:17.083
WELL, IF ANYONE
WAS GREAT TODAY,

32:17.083 --> 32:18.250
IT'S BECAUSE OF YOU.

32:18.250 --> 32:21.125
I HAVE YOU TO THANK
FOR THIS, YOU KNOW.

32:22.625 --> 32:24.917
OH, THAT MAY
VERY WELL BE TRUE,

32:24.917 --> 32:25.917
BUT--

32:25.917 --> 32:27.208
(SIGHS)

32:27.208 --> 32:29.125
YOU CAN SAVE YOUR SPEECH
FOR SUNDANCE.

32:29.125 --> 32:31.125
I'M EXHAUSTED.

32:32.375 --> 32:34.041
SPEND THE NIGHT.

32:34.041 --> 32:35.041
(LAUGHS)

32:35.041 --> 32:36.708
AND WHAT
WOULD WE CALL THAT?

32:36.708 --> 32:39.250
LIFE IMITATING
ART IMITATING LIFE?

32:39.250 --> 32:41.875
I...DON'T KNOW.

32:41.875 --> 32:42.792
I'M TOO TIRED
TO FIGURE IT OUT.

32:42.792 --> 32:45.333
IT'S OK IF
YOU DON'T WANT TO.
I UNDERSTAND.

32:46.417 --> 32:47.708
IT'S
A LITTLE WEIRD.

32:48.834 --> 32:50.750
NOT TO MENTION
SOMEWHAT DANGEROUS.

32:50.750 --> 32:52.792
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

32:57.708 --> 32:59.166
I DON'T KNOW.

33:02.125 --> 33:05.333
WHAT IF YOU WOKE UP
AND YOU WERE 15 AGAIN?

33:08.792 --> 33:11.583
THE FUNNY THING IS--IS--

33:11.583 --> 33:13.291
(SIGHS)

33:13.291 --> 33:15.667
I DON'T FEEL
THAT WAY ANYMORE.

33:17.625 --> 33:19.417
WATCHING YOU SHOOT
THOSE SCENES TODAY,

33:19.417 --> 33:21.625
IT WAS LIKE THIS...

33:21.625 --> 33:24.792
HUGE WEIGHT
HAS BEEN LIFTED.

33:24.792 --> 33:26.625
YEAH.

33:28.375 --> 33:30.208
YEAH, I KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN.

33:30.208 --> 33:32.208
SHOOTING THIS MOVIE

33:32.208 --> 33:34.208
IS GONNA SAVE ME
TONS OF MONEY
ON THERAPY.

33:34.208 --> 33:36.667
(LAUGHS)

33:36.667 --> 33:38.417
TODAY WAS A GREAT DAY.

33:38.417 --> 33:39.667
OH, THE BEST.

33:39.667 --> 33:42.208
I MEAN, HOW MANY
TRULY GREAT DAYS

33:42.208 --> 33:43.959
ARE WE GONNA
HAVE IN OUR LIVES?

33:43.959 --> 33:45.834
I DON'T KNOW.

33:46.917 --> 33:48.917
WHO KNOWS
HOW MANY YOU GET?

33:51.667 --> 33:53.333
WHEN THEY DO HAPPEN
TO COME ALONG,
THOUGH,

33:53.333 --> 33:54.625
I HOPE
YOU'RE CLOSE BY,

33:54.625 --> 33:55.834
AT LEAST
FOR A FEW OF 'EM.

33:58.208 --> 33:59.875
ME, TOO.

34:11.041 --> 34:13.958
SO HOW WOULD YOU
DESCRIBE YOUR MOVIE?

34:13.958 --> 34:16.208
IF SOMEBODY ASKED YOU,
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?

34:17.500 --> 34:21.500
I WOULD SAY...

34:21.500 --> 34:24.875
IT'S ABOUT A GIRL
WHO WANTED MORE
THAN WHAT SHE HAD...

34:25.792 --> 34:28.208
WHO HAD TO GROW UP
TO REALIZE

34:28.208 --> 34:30.750
THAT SHE ALREADY HAD
EVERYTHING SHE EVER
COULD'VE WANTED.

34:36.208 --> 34:38.750
I LIKE THAT.

34:41.417 --> 34:43.875
I DON'T WANNA
CLOSE MY EYES.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.417
WHY?

34:49.250 --> 34:52.208
I'M AFRAID
WHEN I OPEN 'EM,
YOU WON'T BE HERE.

34:54.041 --> 34:56.500
CLOSE YOUR EYES,
DAWSON.

36:11.166 --> 36:12.125
HEY.

36:14.500 --> 36:15.667
HEY.

36:17.875 --> 36:18.959
WHAT ARE YOU
DOIN' HERE?

36:20.208 --> 36:22.500
UH, THE SAME THING
YOU ARE, I'D SUPPOSE.

36:22.500 --> 36:24.417
ACTUALLY, I
CAME HERE TO MEET--

36:24.417 --> 36:25.375
MEET WITH JOEY?

36:25.375 --> 36:27.166
YEAH, SO DID I.

36:28.250 --> 36:29.542
I GET IT.

36:29.542 --> 36:31.041
(SIGHS)

36:31.041 --> 36:33.417
JOEY POTTER:
AMATEUR
PEACE BROKER.

36:35.542 --> 36:37.000
(SIGHS)

36:37.000 --> 36:38.000
SO WHERE IS SHE?

36:38.000 --> 36:38.959
I DON'T KNOW,

36:38.959 --> 36:41.834
BUT I'D SAY THAT SHE
IS PROBABLY NOT COMING.

36:41.834 --> 36:43.667
I THINK SHE HAS
THIS KOOKY NOTION

36:43.667 --> 36:45.959
THAT YOU AND I ARE
GONNA WORK THIS OUT
BETWEEN OURSELVES.

36:45.959 --> 36:48.500
WELL, THAT'S...

36:48.500 --> 36:50.000
NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

36:50.000 --> 36:52.000
YEAH, I KNOW.
THAT'S WHAT I TOLD HER,

36:52.000 --> 36:53.458
BUT WE'RE TALKIN' ABOUT A GIRL
WHO'S NEVER REALLY LISTENED

36:53.458 --> 36:56.333
TO A SINGLE WORD THAT EITHER
YOU OR I HAS EVER TOLD HER,

36:56.333 --> 36:59.083
AND I DID, I SAID IT TO HER,
I SAID, "LOOK, JO,

36:59.083 --> 37:02.333
THINGS WILL NEVER BE THE SAME
BETWEEN DAWSON AND I."

37:02.333 --> 37:04.250
SHE DOESN'T LISTEN TO ME.

37:04.250 --> 37:06.125
YOU KNOW HER,
SHE'S STUBBORN, THAT GIRL.

37:11.208 --> 37:12.208
(SIGHS)

37:12.208 --> 37:13.875
WELL,
IF SHE'S NOT COMIN',
I'M GONNA TAKE OFF.

37:13.875 --> 37:14.959
I'VE GOT
SOMEWHERE TO BE.

37:17.834 --> 37:19.000
HOLD ON
FOR ONE SECOND.

37:19.000 --> 37:20.625
(SIGHS)

37:22.500 --> 37:25.375
LOOK, YOU SAID SOME
PRETTY CRAPPY THINGS
THE OTHER DAY.

37:25.375 --> 37:26.834
YEAH. SO DID YOU.

37:27.667 --> 37:29.583
YES, I DID.

37:29.583 --> 37:31.708
AND I MEANT THEM 100%.

37:31.708 --> 37:32.708
I KNOW,
SO DID I, PACE,

37:32.708 --> 37:34.000
AND
THAT'S THE THING,

37:34.000 --> 37:34.750
I DON'T KNOW HOW
WE GET PAST THAT.

37:34.750 --> 37:37.000
WELL, MAYBE WE DON'T.

37:38.125 --> 37:39.500
MAYBE THAT'S THE POINT

37:39.500 --> 37:40.750
THAT WE JUST
DON'T GET PAST IT,

37:40.750 --> 37:42.750
WE REALIZE THAT...

37:42.750 --> 37:45.250
WE CAN'T GO BACK
TO THE WAY THINGS
USED TO BE,

37:45.250 --> 37:46.583
AND THERE'S NOTHING
WE CAN DO ABOUT THAT

37:46.583 --> 37:48.375
'CAUSE THE GUYS
THAT WE ARE NOW

37:48.375 --> 37:51.250
ARE WORLDS APART
FROM THE GUYS THAT
WE WERE BACK THEN.

37:51.250 --> 37:53.250
THE ONLY TIE THAT
REALLY BINDS US TOGETHER

37:53.250 --> 37:55.291
IS THE FACT THAT WE
STILL LOVE THE SAME WOMAN.

38:03.208 --> 38:04.750
(SIGHS)

38:04.750 --> 38:07.458
IT ALWAYS COMES BACK
TO THAT, DOESN'T IT?

38:09.083 --> 38:11.417
YES, IT DOES.

38:11.417 --> 38:13.083
YES, IT DOES,
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

38:13.083 --> 38:15.083
I DON'T REALLY REGRET
A SINGLE SECOND

38:15.083 --> 38:16.667
THAT I SPENT WITH HER,

38:16.667 --> 38:18.667
AND I'M GUESSING
YOU DON'T EITHER.

38:20.291 --> 38:23.625
IN FACT, I REALLY
CONSIDER US PRETTY LUCKY...

38:24.917 --> 38:26.291
THAT A--A WOMAN LIKE THAT

38:26.291 --> 38:28.875
WOULD GIVE EITHER ONE OF US
THE TIME OF DAY.

38:30.125 --> 38:32.208
YOU KNOW,
IT MAKES SENSE.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.458
WHAT DOES?

38:34.458 --> 38:36.750
WHY IT NEVER WORKED OUT
FOR EITHER ONE OF US.

38:39.083 --> 38:41.500
ALL WE WANTED WAS HER.

38:41.500 --> 38:44.291
SO MUCH SO
THAT WE DESTROYED
OUR FRIENDSHIP...

38:45.959 --> 38:47.291
AND IN THE END,
ALL SHE EVER WANTED

38:47.291 --> 38:49.583
WAS FOR US
TO BE FRIENDS AGAIN.

38:56.834 --> 38:58.375
OK, I'M GONNA
ASK YOU THIS ONCE,

38:58.375 --> 39:00.667
AND THEN I PROMISE YOU
I'LL NEVER ASK IT AGAIN.

39:02.166 --> 39:03.667
IS IT POSSIBLE?

39:03.667 --> 39:05.041
FOR US TO BE
FRIENDS AGAIN?

39:17.667 --> 39:19.291
ANYTHING'S POSSIBLE.

39:23.041 --> 39:24.792
FAIR ENOUGH.

39:24.792 --> 39:27.208
LOOK, UH,
THIS IS FOR YOU.

39:27.208 --> 39:29.959
WHAT'S THIS?

39:29.959 --> 39:31.625
WELL, I HOPE
YOU DON'T MIND,

39:31.625 --> 39:34.291
BUT I TOOK THE LIBERTY
OF GOING TO SEVERAL
LOCAL BUSINESSMEN

39:34.291 --> 39:35.333
AND ASKING THEM
IF THEY'D LIKE TO INVEST

39:35.333 --> 39:37.500
IN A VERY PROMISING
YOUNG FILMMAKER,

39:37.500 --> 39:39.000
AND, BY AND LARGE,
THEY WERE ALL VERY RECEPTIVE,

39:39.000 --> 39:40.458
THOUGH THERE WAS
THIS ONE DENTIST,

39:40.458 --> 39:42.375
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW
SHE GOT THIS IN HER HEAD,

39:42.375 --> 39:44.000
BUT SHE SEEMS TO THINK
SHE'S AN ACTRESS,

39:44.000 --> 39:45.250
SO YOU MIGHT HAVE
TO GIVE HER A LITTLE ROLE,

39:45.250 --> 39:47.333
LIKE A CAMEO AT MOST.

39:47.333 --> 39:49.166
JUST WARNIN' YA.

40:01.375 --> 40:02.834
THANK YOU.

40:04.166 --> 40:06.500
DON'T MENTION IT.

40:36.500 --> 40:39.083
Joey: I USED TO BE AFRAID
OF SO MANY THINGS...

40:39.083 --> 40:40.291
(CHEERING)

40:40.291 --> 40:41.959
THAT'S A WRAP!

40:45.083 --> 40:46.250
Joey:
THAT I'D NEVER GROW UP.

40:46.250 --> 40:47.917
THAT I'D BE TRAPPED
IN THE SAME PLACE

40:47.917 --> 40:49.583
FOR ALL ETERNITY.

40:51.500 --> 40:54.792
THAT MY DREAMS WOULD
FOREVER BE SHY OF MY REACH.

41:03.166 --> 41:05.458
IT'S TRUE WHAT THEY SAY.

41:05.458 --> 41:07.583
TIME PLAYS TRICKS ON YOU.

41:07.583 --> 41:08.959
ONE DAY YOU'RE DREAMING,

41:08.959 --> 41:11.125
THE NEXT YOUR DREAM
HAS BECOME YOUR REALITY.

41:11.125 --> 41:12.166
AU REVOIR.

41:19.083 --> 41:22.750
AND NOW THAT THIS SCARED
LITTLE GIRL NO LONGER
FOLLOWS ME WHEREVER I GO,

41:22.750 --> 41:24.458
I MISS HER.

41:24.458 --> 41:25.333
I DO.

41:25.333 --> 41:28.917
'CAUSE THERE ARE THINGS
I WANNA TELL HER--

41:28.917 --> 41:31.583
TO RELAX,
TO LIGHTEN UP,

41:31.583 --> 41:34.250
THAT IT IS
ALL GOING TO BE OK.

41:36.250 --> 41:39.000
I WANT HER TO KNOW THAT
MEETING PEOPLE WHO LIKE YOU,

41:39.000 --> 41:40.291
WHO UNDERSTAND YOU,

41:40.291 --> 41:42.041
WHO ACTUALLY ACCEPT YOU
FOR WHO YOU ARE,

41:42.041 --> 41:44.500
WILL BECOME AN INCREASINGLY
RARE OCCURRENCE.

41:44.500 --> 41:48.333
JEN, JACK, AUDREY,
ANDIE, PACEY, AND DAWSON.

41:48.333 --> 41:51.041
THESE PEOPLE WHO
CONTRIBUTED TO WHO I AM,

41:51.041 --> 41:53.959
THEY ARE WITH ME
WHEREVER I GO,

41:53.959 --> 41:55.166
AND AS HISTORY
GETS REWRITTEN

41:55.166 --> 41:57.333
IN SMALL WAYS
WITH EACH PASSING DAY,

41:57.333 --> 42:01.000
MY LOVE FOR THEM
ONLY GROWS.

42:01.000 --> 42:04.375
BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS...
IT WAS THE BEST OF TIMES.

42:04.375 --> 42:07.000
MISTAKES WERE MADE,
HEARTS WERE BROKEN,

42:07.000 --> 42:08.667
HARSH LESSONS LEARNED,

42:08.667 --> 42:11.959
BUT ALL OF THAT HAS RECEDED
INTO FOND MEMORY NOW.

42:11.959 --> 42:13.834
HOW DOES IT HAPPEN?

42:13.834 --> 42:15.333
WHY ARE WE SO QUICK
TO FORGET THE BAD

42:15.333 --> 42:17.333
AND ROMANTICIZE THE GOOD?

42:17.333 --> 42:19.250
MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE
WE NEED TO BELIEVE

42:19.250 --> 42:20.125
THAT THE TIME
WE SPENT TOGETHER

42:20.125 --> 42:22.333
ACTUALLY MEANT SOMETHING,

42:22.333 --> 42:26.375
THAT WE WERE THERE FOR EACH
OTHER IN A TIME IN OUR LIVES
THAT DEFINED US ALL,

42:26.375 --> 42:29.125
A TIME IN OUR LIVES
THAT WE WILL NEVER FORGET.

42:37.041 --> 42:40.375
I CAN'T SWEAR THIS
IS EXACTLY HOW IT HAPPENED.

42:42.000 --> 42:44.083
BUT THIS IS HOW IT FELT.
