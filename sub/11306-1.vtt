12:44.280 --> 12:45.508
We're ready for you,
Mr. Whitlock!

12:45.600 --> 12:47.670
BAIRD: "Not so,
Sperm-ulina."

12:50.760 --> 12:52.352
(GRUNTS SOFTLY)

12:55.520 --> 12:56.520
(GRUNTS)

12:57.080 --> 12:58.760
EDDIE: Gentlemen,
thank you all for coming.

12:58.880 --> 13:00.632
I know you have parishes,
flocks and temples

13:00.800 --> 13:02.518
making enormous
demands on your time.

13:02.680 --> 13:03.795
But I'm sure you
appreciate also

13:03.880 --> 13:05.359
that great masses
of humanity

13:05.520 --> 13:08.273
look to pictures for
information and uplift

13:08.440 --> 13:10.556
and, yes, entertainment.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.110
Now, here at Capitol Pictures,
as you know,

13:13.280 --> 13:16.795
an army of technicians and actors
and top-notch artistic people

13:16.960 --> 13:20.191
are working hard to bring to the
screen the story of the Christ.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.719
It's a swell story.

13:21.880 --> 13:23.472
A story told before, yes,

13:23.640 --> 13:24.755
but we like to
flatter ourselves

13:24.840 --> 13:25.875
that it's never been told

13:26.040 --> 13:27.917
with this kind of
distinction and panache.

13:28.080 --> 13:31.390
Perhaps, sir, you forget its
telling in the Holy Bible.

13:31.560 --> 13:34.028
Quite right, Patriarch.
The Bible, of course, is terrific.

13:34.120 --> 13:35.712
But for
millions of people,

13:35.880 --> 13:38.758
pictures will be their
reference point for the story.

13:38.880 --> 13:42.236
The story's embodiment,
the story's, uh...

13:42.320 --> 13:45.073
Realization.

13:45.160 --> 13:48.311
You "realize," of course,
that for we Jews,

13:48.400 --> 13:52.234
any visual depiction of the Godhead
is most strictly prohibited.

13:52.640 --> 13:53.640
Oh.

13:54.320 --> 13:57.756
But, of course, for us, the man
Jesus Nazarene is not God.

13:57.920 --> 13:58.920
A-ha!

13:59.240 --> 14:00.753
Who plays Christ?

14:00.920 --> 14:02.638
Oh, a kid we're all
very excited about.

14:02.720 --> 14:03.835
Todd Hocheiser.

14:03.920 --> 14:07.469
Wonderful young actor we found in Akron,
Ohio, in a nationwide talent hunt.

14:07.640 --> 14:09.551
But Hocheiser is
seen only fleetingly

14:09.640 --> 14:11.198
and with extreme taste.

14:11.360 --> 14:14.511
Our story is told through the
eyes of a Roman tribune.

14:14.680 --> 14:16.750
Autolochus Antoninus.

14:16.960 --> 14:19.269
Ordinary man,
skeptical at first,

14:19.440 --> 14:21.112
but who comes to
a grudging respect

14:21.280 --> 14:22.952
for this swell
figure from the East.

14:23.280 --> 14:25.635
And Autolochus
is played by

14:26.360 --> 14:27.952
Baird Whitlock.

14:28.440 --> 14:29.440
Oh, my.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.434
Well, he is certainly
a great talent.

14:32.640 --> 14:34.240
Now, Hail, Caesar!
Is a prestige picture,

14:34.320 --> 14:35.799
our biggest
release of the year,

14:35.960 --> 14:38.235
and we're devoting huge
resources to its production

14:38.320 --> 14:39.594
in order to
make it first-class

14:39.680 --> 14:40.715
in every respect.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.189
Gentlemen, given
its enormous expense,

14:43.400 --> 14:45.311
we don't wanna send it to
market except in the certainty

14:45.480 --> 14:47.914
that it will not offend
any reasonable American

14:48.000 --> 14:50.389
regardless of faith or creed.

14:50.480 --> 14:52.789
Now that's where you come in.
You've read the script.

14:52.880 --> 14:54.960
I wanna know if the theological
elements of the story

14:55.080 --> 14:56.080
are up to snuff.

14:56.240 --> 14:58.310
I thought the
chariot scene was fakey.

14:58.480 --> 15:00.560
How is he going to jump from
one chariot to the other

15:00.640 --> 15:02.312
going full speed?

15:04.640 --> 15:05.640
Uh-huh.

15:05.680 --> 15:07.796
Well, we can look at that.

15:08.160 --> 15:10.913
But as for the
religious aspect,

15:11.000 --> 15:13.594
does the depiction of Christ
Jesus cut the mustard?

15:14.320 --> 15:16.151
Well, the nature of Christ
is not quite as simple

15:16.240 --> 15:17.719
as your photoplay
would have it.

15:17.880 --> 15:18.915
How so, Father?

15:19.000 --> 15:22.231
It's not the case simply
that Christ is God, or God Christ.

15:22.440 --> 15:23.509
You can say
that again.

15:23.600 --> 15:25.033
The Nazarene
was not God.

15:25.200 --> 15:26.349
He was not not-God.

15:26.440 --> 15:27.600
RABBI: He was a man.
Part God.

15:27.680 --> 15:28.749
RABBI: No, sir.

15:28.840 --> 15:30.831
But, Rabbi, all of us have a
little bit of God in us, don't we?

15:30.920 --> 15:31.920
Well...

15:32.000 --> 15:33.752
It's the foundation
of our belief

15:33.840 --> 15:37.674
that Christ is most properly
referred to as the Son of God.

15:37.920 --> 15:41.515
It's the Son of God who takes the
sins of the world upon himself

15:42.200 --> 15:46.955
so that the rest of God's children,
we imperfect beings,

15:47.120 --> 15:50.430
through faith, may enter
the Kingdom of heaven.

15:51.720 --> 15:54.188
So God is split?
CATHOLIC CLERGYMAN: Yes.

15:54.880 --> 15:56.029
And no.

15:56.120 --> 15:57.678
EASTERN ORTHODOX CLERGYMAN:
There is unity in division.

15:57.760 --> 15:59.113
And division
in unity.

15:59.280 --> 16:00.554
I'm not sure
I follow, Padre.

16:00.720 --> 16:02.800
Young man, you don't follow
for a very simple reason.

16:02.960 --> 16:04.109
These men
are screwballs.

16:04.280 --> 16:06.271
RABBI: God has children?
What, and a dog?

16:06.800 --> 16:08.028
A collie, maybe?

16:08.120 --> 16:09.314
God doesn't
have children.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.118
He's a bachelor.
And very angry.

16:11.240 --> 16:12.320
No, no, he used
to be angry.

16:12.400 --> 16:13.400
What?
He got over it?

16:13.560 --> 16:14.920
You worship the God
of another age.

16:15.080 --> 16:16.229
Who has no love.

16:16.400 --> 16:17.879
Not true.
He likes Jews.

16:18.080 --> 16:19.149
God loves everyone.

16:19.240 --> 16:20.355
God is love!

16:21.080 --> 16:22.195
God is who he is.

16:22.280 --> 16:24.032
This is special?
Who isn't who is?

16:24.120 --> 16:27.078
But how should God be
rendered in a motion picture?

16:27.240 --> 16:28.559
God isn't in the
motion picture!

16:28.720 --> 16:30.073
Then who is
Todd Hocheiser?

16:30.240 --> 16:32.754
Gentlemen, maybe we're biting off
more than we can chew.

16:32.920 --> 16:35.150
We don't need to agree on
the nature of the deity here,

16:35.320 --> 16:38.995
if we could focus on the Christ,
whatever his parentage.

16:39.160 --> 16:42.391
My question is,
is our depiction fair?

16:42.600 --> 16:43.794
I have seen worse.

16:43.880 --> 16:44.915
Reverend?

16:45.160 --> 16:47.958
There is nothing to
offend a reasonable man.

16:48.040 --> 16:49.075
EDDIE: Father.

16:49.160 --> 16:51.958
CATHOLIC CLERGYMAN: The motion picture
teleplay was respectful

16:52.040 --> 16:54.873
and exhibited
tastefulness and class.

16:54.960 --> 16:56.678
Who made you an expert
all of a sudden?

16:58.520 --> 17:00.112
And what do
you think, Rabbi?

17:00.440 --> 17:01.440
Eh...

17:01.640 --> 17:03.437
I haven't
an opinion.

17:03.960 --> 17:05.393
How did we do?
I don't...

17:05.480 --> 17:06.959
Fine. What's up?

17:07.119 --> 17:09.031
Can't find
Baird Whitlock.

17:09.200 --> 17:10.234
He left the set
over an hour ago,

17:10.319 --> 17:11.958
said he was going
to his dressing room,

17:12.040 --> 17:13.189
but he isn't there.

17:13.280 --> 17:15.349
Out on a bender? Middle of the day?
Am I crazy?

17:15.440 --> 17:17.192
You're not crazy,
but, no.

17:17.359 --> 17:20.715
I checked the Til Two, Dan Tana's,
Rusty Scupper. No soap.

17:20.800 --> 17:22.279
Home, maybe? Called his wife?
Yep.

17:22.440 --> 17:23.440
What did Laura say?

17:23.560 --> 17:24.800
"He's not home,
he's never home.

17:24.880 --> 17:26.233
"He's a louse.
Try one of his chippies."

17:26.319 --> 17:27.752
Called that script girl,
what's her name, Francie?

17:27.839 --> 17:28.875
Uh, check.

17:28.960 --> 17:29.995
Any of the gals
missing from the set?

17:30.080 --> 17:31.080
Nope.

17:31.240 --> 17:34.118
EDDIE: All right, gone an hour?
We won't worry yet.

17:40.400 --> 17:41.435
STUDIO ASSISTANT: Hobie?

17:42.200 --> 17:44.031
The studio says
you're finished here,

17:44.120 --> 17:45.838
and you're to report
back to the lot.

17:45.960 --> 17:46.995
How come?

17:47.160 --> 17:48.513
They're changing
your image.

17:48.680 --> 17:49.715
Okay.

17:49.920 --> 17:52.275
And the studio says you're
escorting Carlotta Valdez

17:52.360 --> 17:53.759
to your premiere tonight.

17:54.480 --> 17:55.913
How come?
I don't know her.

17:56.000 --> 17:58.798
The studio's arranging it.
They're changing your image.

Ma'am? Miss.
Do I look married?

21:07.400 --> 21:09.516
No, miss.
No! Yeah, "Gas again."

21:10.000 --> 21:11.399
Ask him. He knows.

21:11.560 --> 21:12.913
All right. Scram.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.193
How are you,
DeeAnna?

21:15.920 --> 21:17.990
How am I? Wet.

21:18.080 --> 21:20.480
I don't think I'm gonna fit in
that fish-ass after this week.

21:20.560 --> 21:22.596
Oh, we should have the water
ballet in the can after tomorrow.

you that's more forgiving.

who you might marry?

21:30.040 --> 21:31.040
(SCOFFS)

21:31.080 --> 21:32.957
I ain't doing that again.
I had two marriages.

21:33.040 --> 21:35.315
It just cost the studio a lot
of money to bust them up.

21:35.400 --> 21:36.674
Well, we had to
have those annulled.

21:36.760 --> 21:38.000
One was to
a minor mob figure...

21:38.080 --> 21:39.798
Vince was not minor.

21:39.960 --> 21:40.949
And Buddy Flynn
was a bandleader

21:41.040 --> 21:42.837
with a long history
of narcotic use.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.797
Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm saying.
They were both louses.

21:44.880 --> 21:46.916
Marrying a third louse
ain't gonna do me no good.

21:47.080 --> 21:49.160
We've offered you some very
suitable, clean young men.

21:49.200 --> 21:50.918
Pretty boys,
saps and swishes!

21:51.000 --> 21:53.195
What, you think if there
wasn't a good, reliable man,

21:53.280 --> 21:54.360
I wouldn't have
grabbed him?

21:54.440 --> 21:56.556
What about Arne Seslum?
He is the father, isn't he?

21:56.760 --> 21:57.909
Yeah, yeah.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.877
The marriage doesn't
have to last forever.

22:00.040 --> 22:01.837
But, DeeAnna,
having a child without a father

22:02.000 --> 22:04.200
would present a public-relations
problem for the studio.

22:04.240 --> 22:06.310
The aquatic pictures
do very nicely for us.

22:06.880 --> 22:09.519
So you go and strap on a
fish-ass and marry Arne Seslum.

22:09.720 --> 22:11.233
The pictures do well
for all of us,

22:11.320 --> 22:12.799
and it's a tribute to you.

22:12.880 --> 22:15.314
The public loves you because
they know how innocent you are.

22:15.680 --> 22:17.113
That's true.

22:17.200 --> 22:18.679
Let me see if Arne
is open to matrimony.

22:18.760 --> 22:19.880
You're sure he's the father?

22:19.920 --> 22:22.639
Yeah, yeah. Absolutely,
he's the father, yes!

22:23.000 --> 22:24.069
Pretty sure.

22:24.960 --> 22:26.678
Hey, Maxie,
bring me my ass back.

Welcome.

Laurence Laurentz.

23:38.360 --> 23:41.079
And you look wonderful, wonderful.
How do you feel?

23:41.600 --> 23:44.512
Uh, well, this here
collar is a little tight.

23:44.680 --> 23:46.591
No, no, no.
It's nicely fit, looks a marvel.

23:46.680 --> 23:48.557
Oh.
Just takes a little getting used to.

23:49.400 --> 23:51.755
Now, Hobie,
here is our set.

23:51.920 --> 23:54.559
And, in fact, that's right, yes,
you enter from there,

23:54.720 --> 23:56.995
having just seen
Biff's valise in the foyer,

23:57.200 --> 24:00.749
in spite of Allegra's claim that
he hasn't been to the house.

24:00.960 --> 24:02.916
I'm sweet on Allegra.
Indeed you are.

24:03.080 --> 24:04.354
But I seen
Biff's grip.

24:04.440 --> 24:05.668
Indeed you have.

24:05.880 --> 24:08.110
And so here we
find you, Hobie...

24:08.200 --> 24:10.555
We find you haunted
by unspoken suspicions.

24:10.760 --> 24:12.273
Haunted.
By Biff's grip.

24:12.440 --> 24:14.317
By his
valise, yes.

24:14.480 --> 24:17.711
But here is Dierdre

24:17.800 --> 24:19.791
harboring deep
feelings for you,

24:19.880 --> 24:21.199
and sensing opportunity.

24:21.360 --> 24:22.634
Dierdre.
Dierdre, yes.

24:22.720 --> 24:25.109
So at her importuning,
you join her on the couch

24:25.280 --> 24:27.350
and conversation ensues.

24:28.360 --> 24:29.360
Um...

24:30.760 --> 24:33.194
So, she's gonna
importune, Mr. Laurence?

Oh, I'm sorry.

24:35.880 --> 24:37.916
She's gonna importune,
Mr. Laurentz?

24:38.000 --> 24:39.718
Is that something
I should be concerned about?

24:39.800 --> 24:41.028
No, she'll simply
ask you to join her

24:41.160 --> 24:42.354

is all I mean to say,

24:42.440 --> 24:43.429

you respond to her line

a little differently this time.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.149
Sure.
Let's try...

26:30.200 --> 26:31.952
Let's see, first of all,
why don't we

26:32.040 --> 26:33.758
dispense with
the mirthless chuckle?

26:33.920 --> 26:35.353
No mirthless chuckle.

26:35.680 --> 26:38.672
No, no need, really. It was a bad idea.
It was bad directorial.

26:38.840 --> 26:40.432
My fault
overthinking the thing.

26:40.600 --> 26:42.477
If you say so,
but I'm happy to do another,

26:42.560 --> 26:43.754
maybe try her
one more time.

I mean, if you want that chuckle,
I sure wanna give her to you.

No, no, no. Completely unnecessary
under the circumstances.

I think the audience can,
to that extent,

26:50.160 --> 26:51.240
they can read
your thoughts,

26:51.320 --> 26:53.675
and they will assume
your mirthlessness.

disappeared from the set today.

Yes, he did
have to take a break.

think I meant?

No, nothing. I saw
your sister earlier.

some old gossip about Baird.

she was, that cow!

46:32.280 --> 46:34.120
Is that really the best
you could come up with?

46:34.200 --> 46:36.953
We all know about the womanizing
and the drinking jags

46:37.120 --> 46:38.473

to San Berdoo.

46:38.560 --> 46:39.629

in the bunkhouse.

47:44.680 --> 47:46.511
They got me talking a lot,

getting used to,

I just say, "Whitey" or "Whoa, there."

it's talking.

a little at first,

my leg up on her now.

56:58.400 --> 56:59.879
Ilsa Pflug.

57:01.040 --> 57:03.235
Ilsa Pflug-Seslum.

57:04.240 --> 57:05.468
In Malmö.

57:05.560 --> 57:06.754
I was not aware of that.

57:07.040 --> 57:08.678
ARNE: Yeah, two children.

57:09.160 --> 57:10.880
And a third on the way, apparently.
Mmm-hmm.

57:11.040 --> 57:14.828
Do you enjoy physical culture,
Eddie Mannix? Do you ski?

57:15.920 --> 57:19.356
No. I never took it up.
Seems like a lot of fun, Arne.

57:19.440 --> 57:21.431
I no more associate
with DeeAnna Moran.

57:21.520 --> 57:22.589
I hug you.

57:23.480 --> 57:25.038
Goodbye.

57:25.840 --> 57:27.239
BAIRD: I spent the night.

57:27.320 --> 57:29.993
So, I feel somebody poking at me,
and I wake up and it's Clark.

57:30.080 --> 57:33.516
And he says, "Well, your keys aren't
in there, so I guess we're walking."

57:33.880 --> 57:34.880
(ALL LAUGHING)

57:36.520 --> 57:39.751
This was back before
Gable was Gable.

57:39.840 --> 57:43.230
Yeah, we used to go up to
San Berdoo every weekend.

57:43.320 --> 57:45.276
Bob Stack would
come up sometimes.

57:45.360 --> 57:47.271
Blue Grotto
was still open.

57:47.480 --> 57:49.869
Dave Chasen
was a busboy.

57:50.600 --> 57:52.716
Quite a place.
Yours?

57:52.920 --> 57:55.309
Gracious, no. It belongs to
a member of our study group.

57:55.720 --> 57:57.392
He couldn't be
here this afternoon.

57:57.560 --> 57:58.800
He'll be sad to
have missed you.

57:58.880 --> 57:59.915
He's a fan.

58:00.120 --> 58:01.314
Uh-huh.
That's swell.

58:01.480 --> 58:03.232
So, I black out,
I wake up here...

58:04.200 --> 58:05.200
(WINCES)

58:05.560 --> 58:07.391
And I say to myself,

58:07.560 --> 58:09.835
"Baird, you gotta stop doing this."
(ALL LAUGHING)

58:11.600 --> 58:14.558
But you're saying, actually,
technically, I was kidnapped.

58:14.920 --> 58:17.036
Well, technically, yes.

58:17.400 --> 58:18.549
There's gonna be a ransom?

58:18.680 --> 58:20.159
I'd hardly
call it a ransom.

58:20.240 --> 58:22.913
Benedict there.
That's Benedict de Bonaventure.

58:23.000 --> 58:24.797
He wrote
The House of Ahasuaris.

58:25.080 --> 58:28.675
Enormous hit. Made the
studio millions of dollars.

58:28.760 --> 58:30.990
Did you see any of those
millions of dollars, Ben?

58:31.080 --> 58:32.149
I did not.

58:32.440 --> 58:33.555
Dutch over there.

58:34.000 --> 58:36.673
Dutch Zweistrong wrote
All The Way To Uruguay.

58:36.840 --> 58:38.910
I wrote all the
All The Way pictures.

58:39.080 --> 58:41.992
All successful. You see any of
the profits, Dutch? (SCOFFS)

58:42.600 --> 58:44.591
See, all of us
here are writers.

58:45.440 --> 58:48.432
The pictures originated with us.
They're our ideas.

58:48.600 --> 58:50.079
But they're owned
by the studio.

58:50.960 --> 58:53.872
I'm not saying only writers
are being exploited.

58:53.960 --> 58:55.200
I mean, look at
yourself, Baird.

58:58.440 --> 59:00.431
The studio takes
pretty good care of me.

59:00.640 --> 59:01.868
What are you, a child?

59:02.800 --> 59:05.189
I think what Herschel's
trying to say is,

59:05.360 --> 59:08.318
just because the studio owns
the means of production,

59:08.720 --> 59:13.157
why should it be able to
take the money, our money,

59:13.240 --> 59:15.151
the value created
by our labor,

59:15.280 --> 59:17.555
and dole out
what it pleases?

59:17.640 --> 59:18.789
That's not right.

59:18.960 --> 59:22.157
So, no. No.
I wouldn't call it ransom.

59:22.320 --> 59:23.878
Payback.
WRITER 1: That's right.

59:24.080 --> 59:28.551
Now, until quite recently our
study group had a narrow focus.

59:28.720 --> 59:32.395
We concentrated on getting communist
content into motion pictures.

59:32.560 --> 59:34.676
Always in a sub
rosa way, of course.

59:34.880 --> 59:37.235
And we were
pretty darn successful.

59:37.400 --> 59:39.516
You remember in
Kerner's Corner

59:39.720 --> 59:40.755
the town hall scene
where the alderman

59:40.840 --> 59:42.114
overturned the
rotten election

59:42.200 --> 59:43.918
and made Gus the mayor?

59:44.760 --> 59:45.829
Yeah.

59:46.840 --> 59:50.515
Well, I like to think
we've changed a few minds.

59:51.760 --> 59:55.036
But then Dr. Marcuse came down from
Stanford, joined the study group

59:55.200 --> 59:59.159
and started teaching
us about direct action.

59:59.360 --> 01:00:00.918
Praxis.
Action.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:05.551
We each pursue our
own economic interest.

01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:09.317
We ourselves are not above
the laws of history.

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:14.038
But in pursuing our
interests with vigor,

01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:17.431
we accelerate the dialectic

01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:22.036
and hasten the end of history and
the creation of the New Man.

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:24.391
Plus, we make a little dough.
DUTCH: Shut up!

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:26.392
We're not even
talking about money!

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:28.198
We're talking about economics.

01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:30.472
Sure, good.

01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:33.078
Good stuff.

01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:36.832
So, now, uh, do I get
a share of the ransom?

01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:38.109
No.
(ALL LAUGHING)

01:00:38.200 --> 01:00:42.637
No, Mr. Whitlock, you can hardly
share in your own ransom.

01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:44.153
That would be unethical.

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:46.231
I don't know. That doesn't
seem fair, fellas.

01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:49.633
I mean, the whole setup only
works if I play along, right?

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:52.719
If I don't let on that I
know who kidnapped me.

01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:54.199
Well, yes,
that's right.

01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:56.239
What if I name names?

01:00:57.920 --> 01:01:01.071
If I just tell the truth.

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:03.920
Uh...

01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:07.392
I don't think you'll
do that, Mr. Whitlock.

01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:14.438
What if we told the truth
about On Wings as Eagles?

01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:21.553
EDDIE: Sid.

01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:24.840
We have to work something
out for DeeAnna Moran.

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:26.429
She get married again?

01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:28.988
No, that's the problem.
Having a child, not married.

01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:30.189
Whew. Tough.

01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:31.349
Yeah, no father.

01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:32.960
Well, of course
there is one somewhere.

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:34.554
But who knows?
Exactly.

01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:35.755
So is there any way...

01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:37.439
I'm just spitballing here.

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:40.718
Any way she could
adopt her own child?

01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:45.597
Interesting.
As a single... Mmm-hmm.

01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:48.110
She disappears for a while, reappears.
Uh-huh.

01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:50.316
She wants to share her
blessings, adopt a child.

01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:53.313
Sure. She's always
yearned to be a mother.

01:01:53.800 --> 01:01:54.869
That's it.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.558
Well, I don't see
why not.

01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:57.629
Nothing in the
California statute

01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:59.636
prohibits adoption by one's own parent.
Mmm-hmm.

01:02:00.520 --> 01:02:01.714
This is new ground.

01:02:01.800 --> 01:02:03.392
Technically, she'd have
to give up the baby

01:02:03.480 --> 01:02:05.038
to a third party.

01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:06.314
Joe Silverman.

01:02:06.440 --> 01:02:09.034
Joe Silverman. Exactly.

01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:11.799
He's the foster father
for a few days.

01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:14.553
She hands the kid to Joe,
he hands it back.

01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:16.029
I'll do
some research.

01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:17.120
All right.

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:19.157

Mr. Mannix, it's 5:30.

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:20.514
This is exciting.

01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:23.592
NATALIE:...and asked all of the assistant
directors, and one of them said

01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:27.195
that an extra in the courtyard of
Sestimus Amydias seemed jumpy.

01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:28.633
All right. Get Walt
the name of the extra

01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:30.160
so he can bring
him in and sweat him.

01:02:30.240 --> 01:02:31.593
Walt should tell him that
we won't press charges

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:32.635
if he tells us where
Baird's been taken.

01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:33.755
NATALIE: Check.

01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:35.831
And if he plays dumb,
or the AD's wrong and he is dumb,

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:37.148
check the other extras.

01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:38.832
Check. Thessaly Thacker called,
(SIGHS)

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.150
said you promised her an
interview with Baird today.

01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:43.078
Check that. It was
Thora Thacker.

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:44.309
No, it's Thessaly.

01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:45.913
Tell her he was at the
doctor longer than expected,

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.797
and she can see him on the set
bright and early tomorrow.

01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:49.996
Check. And is that
last part true?

01:02:50.120 --> 01:02:51.599
Let's hope so.
Oh, that reminds me.

01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:52.999
I need a list of
everyone who worked on

01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:54.917

who's still at the studio.

On Wings as Eagles?
That's a while ago now.

Aside from Baird and the director,
it won't be a long list.

01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:00.759
Yeah. Get it
for me. That it?

01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:02.757
Uh, no.
One more thing.

01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:05.792
said you know him.
Yeah, yeah.

01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:41.920
You'd never
have to work again

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.036
if you chose to retire
after your term.

01:06:44.640 --> 01:06:46.392
Think about it.

01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:48.511
Lifetime employment.

01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:50.670
You wouldn't be a glorified
working stiff like you are now,

01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:52.560
and you'd be running a business,
not a circus.

01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:56.280
Drink?

01:06:57.920 --> 01:06:58.920
Cigarette?

01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:05.358
No, no. I gotta run.

01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:07.272
I should talk this
over with my wife.

01:07:07.360 --> 01:07:09.280
Of course. Talk it over,
think about your family,

01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:10.953

in the morning.

01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:12.553
Oh! (CHUCKLES)

01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:14.039
If you think
this is a bribe,

01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:15.519
you're absolutely right.

01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:16.829
You have two kids, right?
A boy and a girl?

01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:17.989
That's right.

01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:21.670
They love this stuff.
Used to be trains.

01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:27.031
Oh, hello, Carlotta.

01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:28.120
Am I late?

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:29.714
Oh, no, it ain't nothin'.

01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:32.109
Thanks an awful bunch for
coming to this picture with me.

01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:33.679
I don't know if
you like livestock,

01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:35.955
but I think it's got
moments, I really do.

01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:37.154
You look very purty.

01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:38.354
Thank you, Hobie!

01:08:38.439 --> 01:08:39.475
I'm sure I'll
like the picture.

01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:40.959
I like all of your pictures.

01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:42.040
Well, I like yours, too.

01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:44.076
They are just
the craziest things.

01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:46.720
Uh, is it hard to dance with
all them bananas on your head?

01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:48.791
Oh, no.
Anyone can do it.

01:08:51.800 --> 01:08:54.240
It's all in the hips and the lips
and the eyes and the thighs.

01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:57.200
(DOOR OPENING)

01:09:23.359 --> 01:09:26.272
Little Eddie wanted me to tell
you about his baseball game.

01:09:26.359 --> 01:09:28.316
They won.

01:09:28.399 --> 01:09:29.957
That is terrific.

01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:32.149
(SIGHS) Gosh, I never
called the coach.

01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:33.309
Eddie played at shortstop?

01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:36.596
Mmm. And he did so well,
he wants to stay there now.

01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:38.438
That's great.

01:09:38.720 --> 01:09:39.993
Took care of itself.

01:09:40.479 --> 01:09:43.233
And Darlene did very well
on her Spanish test.

01:09:43.319 --> 01:09:45.993
That's good.
She was worried about that.

01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:48.678
Hey, thanks for heating
up the roast, hon.

01:09:48.760 --> 01:09:49.828
Warm glass of milk?

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:51.433
Uh, no, thanks,
hon. Coffee.

01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:53.511
I gotta run back
to the studio.

01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:54.720
A few things
to take care of.

01:09:55.520 --> 01:09:58.159
Gee, another late night.
Hmm.

01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:02.998
You know, Lockheed
improved their offer.

01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:04.560
Darned good money,

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:06.955
and the hours wouldn't be
crazy like this either.

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:08.872
It's nice
to be wanted.

01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:11.949
Yeah. Sure, but...

01:10:13.640 --> 01:10:15.551

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:19.277

You know best.

Hmm.

NARRATOR: The denizens of Los Angeles
make ready for nightlife, or for sleep.

01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:43.073
But Eddie Mannix
will have neither.

01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:49.075
Even in westerly Malibu,
the sun has moved on,

01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:50.912
leaving the vast
and tireless sea

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.515
to heave itself
blindly upon the shore.

01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:00.919
The communists welcome
a rare moment of leisure.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.355
Brief surcease from struggle.

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:10.478
Baird Whitlock has
become their acolyte,

01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:12.357
a convert to their cause,

01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:15.193
his belief compelled
but not grudging.

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:20.115
He now seeks to learn more
from Professor Marcuse

01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:22.031
and becomes
ever more committed

01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:24.588
to the quest to hasten
an end to history

01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:27.517
and bring on the New Man.

01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:29.438
Herb, that's exactly
what I'm talking about.

01:11:29.520 --> 01:11:31.511
That's what happened to me when
I went to Reno with Danny Kaye,

01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:33.278
and he asked me
to shave his back.

01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:34.634
The exact same thing.

01:11:34.720 --> 01:11:36.358
Because I'm thinking,
"Who benefits?"

01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:39.910
Also, I gotta tell ya, everybody
thinks that Danny is a jerk.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.479
He's not really a jerk.

01:11:41.640 --> 01:11:44.837
It's just the theory generating
its own anti-theory.

01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:46.792
Anyway, there we were,
it's me and Danny,

01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:48.279
and I'm wondering
what the hell am I doing

01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:49.554
with a razor
in my hand.

01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:51.990
And he says it's for
a Norman Taurog picture.

01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:54.429
But Judy Canova is there,
and she knows Norman.

01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:56.600
She says, "Danny's not doing
a Norman Taurog picture.

01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:58.836
"He just wants you
to shave his back!"

01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:00.639
And that's who benefits.

mind, Curly?

you saw me take

fault was it, Curly?

Why, that crazy,
lazy full moon!

never seen me take it.

about this part.

one shot at the song.

never was no moon.

I wish there weren't
no bossy old women!

Don't blame that moon, Curly.

So Joe has done

01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:44.599
just a whole lot of good
work for us in the past.

Whenever we've needed a witness
or a third party for...

I don't know, a petition of grievance
or alienation of affection.

01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:52.834
And he's reliable?

on the planet
in our experience.

01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:00.271
When Chubby Cregar
was intoxicated

01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:02.157
and hit that
pedestrian on Gower,

01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:04.680
we had the vehicle title
transferred to Joe's name,

01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:07.794
and Joe did six months
in LA County lockup.

01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:10.159
But you're off
the sauce now?

01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:12.590
I never touch it.
It was a legal fiction.

01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:13.909
That's right.

acts as the person.

you adopt the child,

01:15:34.800 --> 01:15:37.951

Joe takes possession of it.

No fans, no press, no court officials,
not even a notary public.

EDDIE: Joe himself
is the notary.

You must have
very strong forearms.

01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:07.076
Is it hard
squeezing it like that?

No info. Doesn't know
where they took Baird,

they put him in.

Right. (GASPS)

01:32:21.120 --> 01:32:22.155
Just coming to see you.

01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:23.429
Good morning. Uh...

01:32:23.640 --> 01:32:26.440
Sorry about last night, Thora.
I didn't know your sister would show up.

01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:29.394
Well, that's as may be, but I
certainly learned my lesson.

01:32:29.680 --> 01:32:31.557
Whatever you say today,
Eddie Mannix,

01:32:31.640 --> 01:32:33.119
my column tomorrow
is about

01:32:34.120 --> 01:32:36.111
On Wings as Eagles.

01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:37.673
Thora, I wouldn't do
that if I were you.

01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:38.989
I'm sure you wouldn't.

01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:41.754
No, no, no, you don't understand.
Let's sit down.

01:32:42.160 --> 01:32:44.958
I'm telling you not to run the column,
Thora, for your own good.

01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:46.195
(LAUGHS)

01:32:46.280 --> 01:32:47.554
I can judge
my own interest.

01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:49.471
This will be
the story of the year.

01:32:49.640 --> 01:32:51.232
And it so happens
the Hearst syndicate

01:32:51.320 --> 01:32:53.311
are looking to pick up
a Hollywood column.

01:32:53.480 --> 01:32:54.515
And you think this
will cinch it for you?

01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:55.600
You know it will.

01:32:56.120 --> 01:32:58.759
Baird Whitlock,
your biggest star,

01:32:58.880 --> 01:33:01.519
got his first major part
in On Wings as Eagles

01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:03.238
by engaging in sodomy

01:33:04.440 --> 01:33:07.273
with the picture's director,
Laurence Laurentz.

01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:08.918
Oh, we've all
heard the story.

01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:10.991
But here's something
you haven't heard.

01:33:11.160 --> 01:33:13.435
Your source
is a communist.

01:33:14.200 --> 01:33:15.428
If you print it,
it'll be dismissed

01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:16.555
as a commie smear tactic,

01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:19.109
and you'll be dismissed
as a commie stooge.

01:33:19.320 --> 01:33:20.912
Burt Gurney has
left the country.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.594
The cell he was part of has
been smashed by the police.

01:33:24.200 --> 01:33:25.269
Might have thought
he was credible

01:33:25.360 --> 01:33:27.828
because he's Mr. Laurentz's
current protégé,

01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:32.032
but you don't want to be seen as
Burt Gurney's mouthpiece after this.

01:33:33.080 --> 01:33:35.150
How did you know
Burt was my source?

01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:36.673
Late last night,
I talked to Laurence,

01:33:36.760 --> 01:33:38.557
put two and two together.

01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:41.314
Well, no reason to send this
since I ran into you.

01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:44.200
It's my way of apology for
Thessaly horning in last night.

01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:46.157
I do value
our friendship, Thora,

01:33:46.320 --> 01:33:48.151
but I'm late for
something important.

01:33:51.240 --> 01:33:52.240
(GOAT BLEATING)

01:33:52.600 --> 01:33:54.192
(WOMAN SOBBING)

01:34:06.840 --> 01:34:07.840
(THUNDER RUMBLES)

01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:13.353
Why on your knees before
this Hebrew, Autolochus?

01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:16.080
I encountered him
before, Gracchus.

01:34:16.240 --> 01:34:18.549
Beside the well
of Jehosaphat.

01:34:20.680 --> 01:34:22.557
And what manner of man.

01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:24.432
He's a priest of
the Israelites,

01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:26.511
despised even by
the other priests.

01:34:26.720 --> 01:34:27.869
No.

01:34:28.520 --> 01:34:30.351
On yesterday's march,

01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:33.075
punished by the
dust of the road,

01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:35.276
I sought to drink
first at the well,

01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:36.993
before the slaves
in my charge,

01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:39.753
whose thirst was far
greater than my own.

01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:42.070
A Roman drinks
before a slave.

01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:44.077
This man was
giving water to all.

01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:47.273
He saw no Roman,
he saw no slave.

01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:51.797
He saw only men, weak men,
and gave succor.

01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:56.276
He saw suffering,
which he sought to ease.

01:34:56.440 --> 01:34:58.715
He saw sin,
and gave love.

01:34:59.320 --> 01:35:01.117
Love, Autolochus?

01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:04.514
He saw my own sin,
Gracchus, and greed.

01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:09.112
But in his eyes, I saw
no shadow of reproach.

01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:12.077
I saw only light.

01:35:12.920 --> 01:35:14.638
The light of God.

01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:17.469
You mean,
of the gods.

01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:21.197
I do not, friend Gracchus.

01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:23.840
This Hebrew is
a son of the one God.

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.468
The God of this
far-flung tribe.

01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:30.157
And why shouldn't
God's anointed appear here

01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:33.751
among these strange people,
to shoulder their sins?

01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:39.554
Here, Gracchus,
in this sun-drenched land.

01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:42.468
Why should He
not take this form,

01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:44.951
the form of
an ordinary man?

01:35:45.120 --> 01:35:47.315
A man bringing us
not the old truths,

01:35:48.320 --> 01:35:49.799
but a new one.

01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:52.993
A new truth?

01:35:53.160 --> 01:35:56.357
AUTOLOCHUS: A truth beyond
the truth that we can see.

01:35:56.880 --> 01:35:59.314
A truth beyond this world.

01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:03.992
A truth told not in words,
but in light.

01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:07.950
A truth that we could see
if we had but...

01:36:08.880 --> 01:36:10.996
If we had but...

01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:16.194
Cut! Cut! "Faith!
Have but faith!"

01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:18.555
(BELL RINGING)
"Faith."

01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:20.631
"Faith. Faith!"
God damn it!

01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:21.994
Go one again.
Isn't it...

01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:23.195
They changed it.

01:36:23.360 --> 01:36:25.351
You got most of it, man.
You're all right.

01:36:25.680 --> 01:36:27.750
All right, hang on.
(SIGHS)

01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:29.990
Can I get a pat down?
I'm sweating like a pig in this thing.

01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:31.080
Ah, son of a bitch!

01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:35.240
(SIGHS)

01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:40.076
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

01:36:40.880 --> 01:36:43.519
How long since your
last confession, my son?

01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:47.036
It's been,
what, 27 hours.

01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:51.830
It's really
too often, my son.

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:53.194
You're not
that bad.

01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:55.112
I don't know, Father.

01:36:55.280 --> 01:36:58.431
I snuck a cigarette.
Or two.

01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:01.555
I didn't make it home
in time for dinner.

01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:05.640
(SIGHS)

01:37:06.120 --> 01:37:08.793
And I, uh, struck
a movie star in anger.

01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:14.073
All right.

01:37:14.240 --> 01:37:16.071
Five Hail Marys.

01:37:16.920 --> 01:37:18.273
Okay.

01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:20.593
Okay.

01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:22.919
Father?

01:37:23.880 --> 01:37:25.199
Yes, my son.

01:37:25.400 --> 01:37:27.550
May I ask you
something, Father?

01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:31.472
Of course, my son.

01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:38.428
If there's something
that's easy,

01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:41.550
is that wrong?

01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:43.395
Easy?

01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:45.755
Yeah, easy to do.

01:37:45.960 --> 01:37:47.632
Easy to...

01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:49.239
Like, an easy job.

01:37:49.400 --> 01:37:52.233
No, it's not a bad job.
It's not bad.

01:37:55.280 --> 01:38:00.229
But, then, there's this other
job that's not so easy.

01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:03.119
No, in fact, it's hard.

01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:04.633
It's so hard, Father...

01:38:04.800 --> 01:38:07.473
Sometimes I don't know
if I can keep doing it,

01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:10.471
but it seems right.

01:38:12.960 --> 01:38:14.951
I don't know
how to explain.

01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:22.633
God wants us to
do what's right.

01:38:27.160 --> 01:38:28.354
Yeah.

01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:31.638
Yeah, of course
He does.

01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:34.718
The inner voice that
tells you what's right,

01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:37.474
it comes from God,
my son.

01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:38.795
Yeah, I got it.

01:38:38.960 --> 01:38:40.313
That's His way
of saying that...

01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:41.993
Yeah, yeah,
I got it.

01:38:42.160 --> 01:38:43.673
NATALIE: Still raining
in Gallup, New Mexico.

01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:45.114
And the Tucumcari crew
has shot all the plates

01:38:45.200 --> 01:38:46.474
we need for
Came the Rain.

01:38:46.640 --> 01:38:49.240
Well, just shoot the showdown in
the weather and we'll retitle it.

01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:52.716
Tucumcari Tempest,
Desert Squall, Hold Back The Storm.

01:38:52.880 --> 01:38:55.235
NARRATOR: The stories begin,
the stories end.

01:38:55.400 --> 01:38:56.674
I don't know,
bounce it off the writers.

01:38:56.840 --> 01:38:57.840
NARRATOR: So it has been.

01:38:57.880 --> 01:38:58.915
Here's today's
call list.

01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.514
Add a call to a Mr. Cuddahy
at the Lockheed Corporation.

01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:03.033
Long call?
Short?

01:39:03.200 --> 01:39:05.077
"Thanks, but no thanks."
How long was that?

01:39:05.240 --> 01:39:06.434
NARRATOR: But the story
of Eddie Mannix...

01:39:06.520 --> 01:39:07.748
Who do we
call first?

01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:09.193
...will never end.

01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:10.429
New York first.

01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:11.800
Time to check in
with Mr. Schenk.

01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:16.869
NARRATOR: For his is a tale
written in light everlasting.
