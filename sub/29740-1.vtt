WEBVTT

00:16.391 --> 00:19.144
I thought I'd just begin
by asking you to tell me

00:19.227 --> 00:20.687
what first comes to your mind

00:21.271 --> 00:24.274
-when you hear the name Wynn Handman.

00:25.442 --> 00:27.152
The first thing
that comes to my mind

00:27.235 --> 00:29.237
when I hear the name Wynn Handman

00:29.446 --> 00:31.489
-is the name Wynn Handman.

00:33.533 --> 00:35.702
-I never heard of anyone named Wynn,

00:35.952 --> 00:38.329
and I don't think I'd ever heard
of anyone named Handman,

00:38.997 --> 00:42.167
and then I decided
his name is so interesting.

00:43.001 --> 00:45.795
-He had to be the most interesting person,

00:45.879 --> 00:47.047
and I had to meet him.

00:47.505 --> 00:49.507
<i>In a few moments</i>
<i>you are going to meet Wynn.</i>

00:49.966 --> 00:51.843
<i>I think Wynn was an idealist.</i>

00:51.926 --> 00:53.636
<i>He represents</i>
<i>kind of a keystone...</i>

00:54.554 --> 00:55.722
<i>of American theater.</i>

00:57.057 --> 00:59.100
<i>Terrific director</i>
<i>and a terrific teacher</i>

00:59.559 --> 01:00.894
<i>and sort of a good luck charm.</i>

01:01.019 --> 01:03.855
<i>He'd make a great horse trainer. </i>

01:04.313 --> 01:05.565
<i>He was outspoken.</i>

01:05.732 --> 01:08.651
<i>-Crotchety, irritated with everything.</i>

01:09.319 --> 01:10.695
<i>He was rude.</i>

01:11.488 --> 01:13.490
<i>Wynn was not threatening.</i>

01:14.324 --> 01:15.867
<i>He had a wonderful sense of joy.</i>

01:16.534 --> 01:17.452
<i>Wynn was...</i>

01:18.161 --> 01:19.996
<i>reasonable and rational.</i>

01:20.747 --> 01:24.250
<i>He had mixed feelings about success.</i>

01:24.667 --> 01:27.003
<i>He was such a...</i>
<i>tower of power.</i>

01:27.921 --> 01:29.631
- <i>He didn't...</i>

01:29.881 --> 01:30.924
<i>bullshit anybody.</i>

01:31.674 --> 01:34.844
<i>He's kind of a rough-and-tumble,</i>
<i>tough guy.</i>

01:35.553 --> 01:37.430
<i>Everybody else was wrong,</i>
<i>and Wynn was right.</i>

01:38.264 --> 01:41.476
<i>And he's an intellectual</i>
<i>and he's a lunatic.</i>

01:42.185 --> 01:43.686
<i>That's Wynn Handman.</i>

01:54.114 --> 01:54.948
Okay.

01:58.451 --> 02:00.453
<i>♪ Are you lonesome tonight ♪</i>

02:00.787 --> 02:02.372
<i>-♪ Do you miss me tonight? ♪</i>

02:04.332 --> 02:07.752
I'm happy that all of you are here.

02:11.506 --> 02:15.176
<i>♪ Are you sorry we drifted apart? ♪</i>

02:15.260 --> 02:17.470
And always, uh...

02:17.846 --> 02:21.015
-people wanna call me a nickname, right?
-Yes.

02:21.099 --> 02:22.016
Handy.

02:22.475 --> 02:24.602
So I'll talk a little more about the name.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.104
When we're rolling.

02:26.187 --> 02:28.064
- Yeah.
-We're going back to the beginning.

02:30.900 --> 02:32.777
Irwin Leo Handman.

02:34.571 --> 02:38.867
'Born May 19th, 1922.

02:40.952 --> 02:43.329
I had a very happy childhood...

02:44.289 --> 02:48.710
growing up in a section of Manhattan
called Inwood.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.088
It was the only house on the street.

02:52.797 --> 02:56.259
There was a farm across the street,
a real farm.

02:56.509 --> 02:57.844
That's true.

02:58.469 --> 03:01.848
I had such a happy childhood...

03:02.682 --> 03:05.185
that I never wanted to leave Inwood.

03:10.356 --> 03:12.525
My mother, she would say,

03:13.026 --> 03:14.485
"We call him Sunny."

03:16.654 --> 03:19.908
S-U-N-N-Y.

03:21.993 --> 03:26.706
My mother seemed to me to be very happy
taking care of her children.

03:27.290 --> 03:29.584
My father did what fathers did then.

03:30.293 --> 03:34.339
He earned his money
in order to support his family.

03:36.216 --> 03:39.219
My father did not have many diversions,

03:40.053 --> 03:44.432
but he did have a real love
of going to the racetrack.

03:44.515 --> 03:49.145
-He went every Saturday...

03:50.647 --> 03:52.649
to Belmont Race Track.

03:54.651 --> 03:58.821
But he could not take me,
because I was too young

03:59.072 --> 04:00.990
to gamble at the racetrack.

04:02.200 --> 04:03.451
So he'd come back,

04:03.701 --> 04:05.662
I would be waiting for him.

04:07.080 --> 04:12.293
and he would describe each race to me
with the horses that ran.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.338
But he always said,

04:16.422 --> 04:20.301
and this was something I remember
that my father said to me.

04:20.385 --> 04:21.678
Over and over.

04:22.178 --> 04:23.054
He would say,

04:23.137 --> 04:26.516
"You see, this is first, that's 'Win,'

04:26.599 --> 04:31.437
second place is 'Placed,'
and the third place is 'Show.'

04:32.146 --> 04:35.858
All the rest are 'also-rans.'

04:36.901 --> 04:39.404
Don't you be an also-ran."

04:47.120 --> 04:49.205
The life and legacy of Wynn Handman.

04:49.998 --> 04:53.501
What's wonderful about Wynn
is that he has two lives and two legacies.

04:54.043 --> 04:56.629
One life is that of an acting teacher.

04:58.589 --> 05:00.216
-I remember...
<i>-</i> <i>He was...</i>

05:00.300 --> 05:01.175
...on 56th street.

05:01.259 --> 05:02.927
<i>I think it was 56th street.</i>

05:03.052 --> 05:05.596
<i>It was sort of right behind Carnegie Hall.</i>

05:06.806 --> 05:09.183
There are people in life
who open doors.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.186
Pioneers.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.148
Without those people,

05:15.940 --> 05:18.484
I don't think
we'd have any American theater.

05:18.609 --> 05:21.029
-The room itself was upstairs.
- <i>Upstairs.</i>

05:22.071 --> 05:24.449
<i>The little loft area, pretty tight.</i>

05:25.116 --> 05:30.079
The room itself was interesting
because there were rows of theater seats,

05:30.246 --> 05:31.372
on tiers.

05:31.914 --> 05:34.792
<i>And they had a little back room</i>
<i>with all the little props.</i>

05:34.876 --> 05:36.502
Despite the dinginess,

05:37.211 --> 05:38.254
I found it...

05:39.213 --> 05:40.048
romantic...

05:41.132 --> 05:43.009
and exhilarating.

05:45.053 --> 05:46.804
<i>Why did everyone looks so young?</i>

05:46.888 --> 05:47.722
Oh, Wynn.

05:48.514 --> 05:50.683
He was so young, he was a young man.

05:51.476 --> 05:54.270
Of course, he seemed old at the time
because we were all kids.

05:56.606 --> 05:57.440
Is that me?

05:58.608 --> 06:00.651
Is that me standing up there?
I think it is.

06:02.820 --> 06:03.821
That is me.

06:04.197 --> 06:07.075
Wow... Wow, wow, wow...

06:07.909 --> 06:10.286
When you actually were doing scenes,

06:10.370 --> 06:12.455
we would all have partners.

06:13.915 --> 06:15.750
Usually just one other partner.

06:16.793 --> 06:17.919
Occasionally two.

06:18.419 --> 06:19.545
I remember this.

06:19.670 --> 06:21.964
-The watch on the wall.

06:22.590 --> 06:26.094
Wynn sat behind a desk,
what we could call audience right,

06:26.219 --> 06:27.428
in the front row.

06:29.138 --> 06:30.139
Oh, yeah.

06:30.640 --> 06:34.894
Yep, he would sit right next to the stage.
There was a proscenium stage here.

06:36.270 --> 06:38.731
-So it was like being in a play, kind of.

06:38.856 --> 06:43.569
I remember when I did Wynn's class,
it was very much of a scene study class.

06:47.532 --> 06:48.366
Okay.

06:48.908 --> 06:50.034
This is a rehearsal...

06:51.744 --> 06:53.287
-of a new scene.

06:54.163 --> 06:55.665
Are we ready to get started?

06:55.998 --> 06:58.918
- Let's have a good time.
- Okay, places please.

06:59.127 --> 07:00.795
- Let's work.

07:01.421 --> 07:02.463
Quiet in the house.

07:03.047 --> 07:04.966
But this is something
we should enjoy.

07:05.883 --> 07:06.717
That was Wynn.

07:06.801 --> 07:09.595
- I remember he had a light switch.
-Say when you're ready please.

07:09.679 --> 07:11.347
And he manipulated the lights.

07:11.514 --> 07:14.392
- Ready.
-He then turned the lights on.

07:15.101 --> 07:17.854
-You do your thing.

07:21.899 --> 07:25.027
One thing that he said to me
that stayed with me,

07:26.779 --> 07:31.159
"Great acting doesn't change
throughout history."

07:31.868 --> 07:33.661
You’ve right dared to ask that,

07:33.744 --> 07:36.122
when all knows you’ll be starting
to a girl in your own town

07:36.205 --> 07:37.957
when your father’s rotten
in four months or five.

07:38.040 --> 07:41.002
Yeah, he was saying styles change
but truth doesn't.

07:41.210 --> 07:42.503
-Yeah, good.
-Yeah.

07:42.587 --> 07:43.796
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

07:43.880 --> 07:45.882
...but we’re only talking maybe,

07:46.674 --> 07:50.511
for a thatched place to hold a fine lad
is the like of you.

07:50.595 --> 07:53.556
Truth, that's basically
what he is all about.

07:54.265 --> 07:57.894
- Truthful human behavior...

07:58.394 --> 07:59.562
can't be beat.

08:00.104 --> 08:00.938
Yeah.

08:01.647 --> 08:04.358
You'd do your thing,
and when it came to the end of the scene,

08:04.442 --> 08:05.902
he'd turn the lights off.

08:08.446 --> 08:10.823
And then the lights come back on,

08:10.907 --> 08:14.619
-and usually Wynn would discuss the scene

08:14.702 --> 08:17.330
right then and there
in front of the class.

08:17.747 --> 08:20.750
Because part of it was not just the work
you as an actor did,

08:20.833 --> 08:23.461
part of it was listening
to how he criticized

08:23.544 --> 08:26.464
-the work of the other actors.
- What I like is the language

08:26.589 --> 08:28.257
just flows right out of them.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.425
It's all about language.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.385
You see how fully-flavored
that language is?

08:31.469 --> 08:34.013
It's from the center, and it flows out.

08:34.096 --> 08:36.515
But, you see,
it's not just poetic language.

08:36.599 --> 08:38.183
It grows out of the characters...

08:38.267 --> 08:41.895
You can't treat a class
as one person.

08:42.980 --> 08:44.941
-Wynn didn't...

08:46.025 --> 08:49.153
We didn't spent a lot of time being trees,
do you know what I mean?

08:49.237 --> 08:52.573
-He had the ability to talk

08:52.657 --> 08:55.785
to different students in different ways.

08:55.868 --> 08:58.829
And he knew
what each actor needed.

08:58.913 --> 09:00.873
To say something
that meant something to me,

09:00.957 --> 09:02.917
and didn't mean a hill of beans to you.

09:03.000 --> 09:03.834
Who are you?

09:04.168 --> 09:06.337
Let's find out who you are
and how you work.

09:06.420 --> 09:07.338
In my case,

09:07.421 --> 09:10.383
he worked with me for six months
on nothing but stillness.

09:10.466 --> 09:12.802
Right, you gotta get real
to do the improvisation.

09:13.261 --> 09:17.348
Wynn drew from me
and from all of his students

09:17.431 --> 09:19.433
what was theirs to give.

09:19.517 --> 09:21.143
He's gonna help you find yourself,

09:21.811 --> 09:24.313
-which is all we have to give, anyhow.

09:24.855 --> 09:28.067
I would feel good about this
as a first rehearsal

09:28.401 --> 09:30.194
because I wouldn't want the actors...

09:30.278 --> 09:31.904
We all hung on his every word.

09:33.406 --> 09:37.702
I remember him being very much
about almost the musical shape of things.

09:38.327 --> 09:39.203
What's next?

09:39.537 --> 09:43.583
-He was great at knowing when to speed up.

09:43.708 --> 09:46.252
He goes, "Oh."
Literally, speed up. "I don't know.

09:46.335 --> 09:47.628
Let's give it another try, but--

09:47.712 --> 09:49.672
Don't work it. Say it fast.
Let's just go faster."

09:50.006 --> 09:53.759
And all of a sudden,
a scene which was very problematic--

09:53.843 --> 09:55.845
We couldn't quite get--
All of a sudden, made sense.

09:55.970 --> 09:58.556
-If you did it up to speed,

09:58.681 --> 10:00.433
or with the right energy,

10:00.975 --> 10:02.226
it worked all of a sudden.

10:02.685 --> 10:03.769
Okay, let's go.

10:04.395 --> 10:05.605
So, let's just go. Boom.

10:06.188 --> 10:07.189
And he flipped the light.

10:07.732 --> 10:09.233
And it just took off.

10:11.110 --> 10:12.987
Just happened because it was human.

10:15.072 --> 10:18.117
-You're kind of built to be an actor.

10:18.576 --> 10:21.454
If you have the right environment,
a sense of confidence.

10:21.537 --> 10:24.790
I was somebody
who was totally lacking confidence

10:24.874 --> 10:26.959
-and I think he recognized that.

10:27.710 --> 10:31.797
And Wynn was renowned
for his ability to nurture people.

10:32.590 --> 10:35.593
He created a very comfortable environment

10:36.010 --> 10:37.553
for people to do their best,

10:38.929 --> 10:41.807
for them to gain their confidence.

10:42.683 --> 10:44.185
He pretty much...

10:44.852 --> 10:46.979
took the fear out of my performing.

10:47.438 --> 10:51.150
Just gave me the confidence
to just try and do anything.

10:51.233 --> 10:53.694
Work on the role
and let things happen to him,

10:53.778 --> 10:55.196
and you'll discover what he is.

10:55.279 --> 10:57.865
You should discover
what he is as you work on him.

10:59.367 --> 11:02.787
There was something very kind,
and gentle, and...

11:04.830 --> 11:06.123
fatherly about him.

11:06.207 --> 11:07.333
I'll never forget...

11:08.167 --> 11:12.338
relatively early on, you know,
he pulled me aside and he said,

11:12.421 --> 11:14.757
"Would you like me to tell your mother
how good you are?"

11:15.174 --> 11:19.637
And it was such a relief
for somebody in my case where, you know,

11:19.720 --> 11:22.598
you got a pretty big shadow
between your father.

11:23.474 --> 11:25.393
Wynn sensed, you know,

11:25.476 --> 11:28.479
-I needed that kind of bolstering...

11:29.105 --> 11:30.564
to be relaxed.

11:30.815 --> 11:32.149
Everybody relax.

11:32.483 --> 11:34.068
There are many acting teachers,

11:34.151 --> 11:37.113
-who I don't think really like actors.

11:37.488 --> 11:39.782
I've sat in on certain classes

11:39.865 --> 11:44.745
where you almost see an abusive approach
to how to teach acting.

11:44.829 --> 11:45.871
Wynn never had that.

11:47.623 --> 11:53.045
You used to go to classes excited,
not terrified.

11:54.004 --> 11:59.343
With each of his students,
Wynn was so encouraging.

11:59.969 --> 12:03.264
Never destructive, and for a young actor,

12:03.639 --> 12:08.728
you could be destroyed by the words
of someone in Wynn Handman's position.

12:08.853 --> 12:09.729
It's fragile.

12:09.812 --> 12:13.315
I-- I think you have an affinity
for this character,

12:13.399 --> 12:15.735
but you got to really make him real
for yourself.

12:15.818 --> 12:17.862
-He's not complicated.
- Right.

12:17.987 --> 12:19.363
-She's complicated.
-Yeah.

12:19.488 --> 12:24.243
I want to discover with the actress
what it is that we can find in this scene.

12:24.702 --> 12:27.580
Right now, you don't have anything,
really, to hold onto.

12:27.997 --> 12:30.499
No criticism at this point,
but you have to know...

12:30.583 --> 12:34.545
Wynn gave people the amount
of critique they needed and could handle.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.924
Wynn said,
"Never judge someone else's emotions.

12:39.008 --> 12:40.259
They may not be yours...

12:40.760 --> 12:41.927
and that's okay."

12:42.386 --> 12:44.263
It was a very safe environment.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.265
I think it really is important,

12:46.515 --> 12:49.310
on a personal level,
of "this is my safe place."

12:49.393 --> 12:51.103
You're vulnerable in your '20s.

12:52.521 --> 12:55.733
You're still trying to figure out
not only how to do what you do,

12:55.816 --> 12:56.692
but who you are.

12:58.527 --> 13:00.404
But in the beginning,
there's like a year

13:00.488 --> 13:02.531
where it's very easy to walk away
from this work.

13:02.865 --> 13:05.785
Because it's so odd, so unusual,

13:06.202 --> 13:08.454
compared to what the rest of life is like.

13:08.579 --> 13:09.580
You think about things

13:09.663 --> 13:12.166
that other people spend most of their day
avoiding thinking about.

13:13.584 --> 13:14.627
They drive you crazy.

13:14.710 --> 13:18.255
The depths of drama and characters.
It's very unsettling in a way.

13:18.672 --> 13:22.051
They dare each other,
they take revenge, they scheme,

13:22.134 --> 13:25.679
they manipulate, they play games
with people's lives, right?

13:25.763 --> 13:27.348
That's the world of this play.

13:31.227 --> 13:34.271
Not far from the world
that many people are living today.

13:35.648 --> 13:36.774
-What's next?

13:42.780 --> 13:44.240
<i>I realized...</i>

13:45.157 --> 13:48.869
<i>little things</i>
<i>changed the course of my life.</i>

13:49.662 --> 13:52.081
-<i>Chance.</i>

13:53.207 --> 13:54.583
<i>It rules your life.</i>

13:55.876 --> 13:59.964
<i>I wouldn't have found myself</i>
<i>to be in this profession,</i>

14:01.048 --> 14:02.341
<i>I don't think,</i>

14:03.342 --> 14:05.553
<i>if it weren't for the fact that...</i>

14:06.554 --> 14:08.639
<i>I went into World War II.</i>

14:11.225 --> 14:13.602
<i>It's when I was on a ship.</i>

14:18.190 --> 14:19.900
<i>And I...</i>

14:21.443 --> 14:24.572
<i>I could just be more in touch</i>

14:25.155 --> 14:27.241
<i>with other parts of myself.</i>

14:30.870 --> 14:33.205
<i>I felt things deeply.</i>

14:35.207 --> 14:37.376
<i>More deeply than I ever had.</i>

14:43.841 --> 14:47.303
<i>And I realized there was an inner life.</i>

14:50.723 --> 14:53.559
<i>And I felt that deepness.</i>

14:54.310 --> 14:56.020
<i>And it stayed with me.</i>

14:59.565 --> 15:02.109
<i>And that changed the course of my life.</i>

15:04.778 --> 15:06.864
<i>And I draw on it all the time.</i>

15:08.407 --> 15:12.036
Take your time and become the character...

15:13.245 --> 15:15.706
who can look back on these times.

15:17.833 --> 15:19.585
-Let's get to the reality...
- Yes.

15:20.336 --> 15:21.712
...the true thing.

15:23.547 --> 15:26.884
Beginnings are strenuous in every class.

15:27.051 --> 15:29.178
Beginnings are so important.

15:29.553 --> 15:32.306
So the way you are beginning is all wrong.

15:32.556 --> 15:34.600
-One Sunday,

15:34.850 --> 15:36.810
the radio was on.

15:41.148 --> 15:45.319
And they said something
about a bombing of Pearl Harbor.

15:47.738 --> 15:50.157
I had no idea where Pearl Harbor was.

15:53.118 --> 15:54.662
But it sounded bad.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.124
How is that impacting on you?

15:59.833 --> 16:02.336
I have a natural executive ability.

16:02.670 --> 16:04.630
I could command a squad or...

16:04.713 --> 16:06.715
a platoon or a company, for that matter!

16:06.799 --> 16:09.259
Did you ever even stop
to think about that?

16:11.595 --> 16:15.182
I didn't want to be drafted
into the Army,

16:15.808 --> 16:19.687
because when I grew up,
we were bombarded

16:20.479 --> 16:22.606
with horrors of World War I.

16:23.607 --> 16:28.070
Movies of dying on the barbed wire,
which were horrible.

16:30.072 --> 16:32.783
And I only wanted the Navy.

16:32.866 --> 16:36.787
<i>-♪ Shipmates stand together ♪</i>

16:37.496 --> 16:40.040
<i>♪ Don't give up the ship ♪</i>

16:40.124 --> 16:42.710
Being in the Navy was like a great thing.

16:43.794 --> 16:45.546
So I had a yearning.

16:46.547 --> 16:48.215
I want to be in the Navy.

16:48.298 --> 16:51.677
<i>♪ I joined the Navy to see the world ♪</i>

16:51.844 --> 16:54.221
<i>♪ And what did we see?</i>
<i>We saw the sea ♪</i>

16:54.471 --> 16:56.807
-There was only one thing.

16:58.225 --> 16:59.518
From my childhood,

17:00.310 --> 17:03.230
I had an irregular heartbeat.

17:05.691 --> 17:11.070
The Navy said, "We cannot take anyone
who has an irregular heartbeat."

17:12.740 --> 17:15.951
My father told the relatives...

17:16.660 --> 17:20.748
that I didn't get into the Navy
because I couldn't pass the physical.

17:21.205 --> 17:24.001
Well, this was like a blow to my manhood.

17:25.127 --> 17:27.671
I had an altercation with my father,
and...

17:28.505 --> 17:31.091
I don't know for how long,
I didn't talk to him.

17:34.178 --> 17:37.139
I haven't thought about that
in a long time.

17:38.098 --> 17:41.143
So I went to the Coast Guard,
and they gave me the physical

17:41.226 --> 17:42.061
and they said,

17:42.853 --> 17:45.731
"You have an irregular heartbeat,
but we can take you."

17:51.653 --> 17:55.991
I was allowed to finish
my college education

17:56.450 --> 18:00.829
so that I could enroll
in Officer's Candidate School.

18:03.499 --> 18:06.627
I didn't have a lot of aptitude
for the work.

18:08.462 --> 18:11.340
Seamanship was not a strong point.

18:15.219 --> 18:17.554
Knots. I learned to make knots.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.848
I did not excel.

18:21.934 --> 18:24.103
Gunnery, I was terrible.

18:24.895 --> 18:26.688
I never hit the target.

18:28.023 --> 18:31.110
There was an instructor
overlooking what you were doing.

18:32.319 --> 18:36.740
If the instructor saw
that I couldn't even hit the target,

18:36.824 --> 18:38.450
that would be bad.

18:39.118 --> 18:40.577
And the guy next to me,

18:40.953 --> 18:43.539
who was annoyed
when he didn't hit a bull's-eye...

18:44.414 --> 18:48.293
So I said, "Hey, give me some holes
in my target, will you, please?"

18:48.502 --> 18:49.461
He did.

18:50.546 --> 18:54.758
So the instructor came along, and he saw
that I had a lot of holes in my target.

18:56.927 --> 18:58.846
I've been very lucky...

18:59.763 --> 19:00.973
my whole life.

19:01.932 --> 19:07.521
He has an idea, he's in it, he's doing it,
but he hasn't...

19:08.147 --> 19:11.567
He hasn't brought this character to life
inside him.

19:12.234 --> 19:15.821
-He doesn't... It's not organic.

19:15.904 --> 19:17.739
-It hasn't grown.

19:18.824 --> 19:20.450
I ended up on a ship.

19:25.956 --> 19:28.500
My ship was an icebreaker...

19:29.334 --> 19:30.752
called the Storis.

19:31.587 --> 19:34.506
And I was the youngest officer
on that ship.

19:38.093 --> 19:42.931
The Germans depended upon weather reports
to help them plan their bombing,

19:43.599 --> 19:46.727
so they had a weather station

19:47.311 --> 19:51.481
six hundred miles north
of the Arctic Circle.

19:52.774 --> 19:57.696
And our mission
was to knock out that weather station.

19:59.156 --> 20:01.533
Ballast yourself with reality...

20:03.619 --> 20:06.205
then throw yourself into the sea.

20:06.580 --> 20:08.248
The sea is inspiration.

20:09.124 --> 20:10.918
Well, that's all we're looking for.

20:11.627 --> 20:14.588
The release into the unconscious...

20:15.422 --> 20:17.674
that comes up with images.

20:18.717 --> 20:20.093
You're dealing with images.

20:21.720 --> 20:26.475
We were the first ship
to capture Germans at sea.

20:29.353 --> 20:34.691
We had 22 German prisoners on our ship.

20:39.154 --> 20:44.368
When the Germans came aboard the ship,
I didn't feel like saluting them.

20:46.245 --> 20:49.581
I had a captain who was very strict

20:49.665 --> 20:54.503
on what he thought
was correct procedure with prisoners.

20:54.795 --> 20:59.675
So when he saw I wasn't saluting,
he ordered me to salute them

20:59.883 --> 21:01.260
when they came aboard.

21:01.843 --> 21:04.054
-That to him was protocol.

21:04.846 --> 21:06.306
He couldn't imagine...

21:07.266 --> 21:08.809
that I was Jewish.

21:12.354 --> 21:14.898
Now, with where your voice is right now,

21:14.982 --> 21:16.483
say your opening lines.

21:17.150 --> 21:20.070
Give me a pack of cigarettes.
Marlboro, hard pack.

21:24.700 --> 21:29.705
Cigarette smoking was very big
during the period of World War II.

21:31.957 --> 21:32.833
Very big.

21:33.625 --> 21:34.835
As the youngest officer,

21:34.960 --> 21:40.507
I had the responsibility of taking care
of the ship's service store.

21:41.008 --> 21:44.094
-Now the popular brands of cigarettes

21:44.177 --> 21:46.972
were Chesterfields,

21:47.222 --> 21:50.767
-Luckys, Camels,

21:51.518 --> 21:54.271
Philip Morris, and Old Gold.

21:55.272 --> 21:58.608
-Now the slowest seller was Old Gold,

21:59.109 --> 22:01.903
so I gave the Germans Old Gold cigarettes.

22:02.279 --> 22:04.656
So, one time, I was summoned.

22:06.033 --> 22:08.910
Make a little megaphone with your hand.

22:09.703 --> 22:11.413
"Mr. Handman,

22:12.247 --> 22:14.249
report to the captain's cabin."

22:14.333 --> 22:15.375
Uh-oh...

22:16.335 --> 22:17.336
what did I do?

22:17.919 --> 22:19.463
I go there, and he said,

22:20.172 --> 22:21.423
"Mr. Handman,

22:21.673 --> 22:26.345
I hear that you are only giving

22:26.720 --> 22:29.431
the German prisoners Old Gold cigarettes."

22:29.514 --> 22:32.601
"Sir, we have a surplus of Old Gold,
and--"

22:32.768 --> 22:37.356
"You will not discriminate
against the German prisoners!"

22:37.439 --> 22:38.523
"Aye aye, sir."

22:39.941 --> 22:40.901
That was it.

22:43.070 --> 22:46.156
Any of you know it?
<i>The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial?</i>

22:46.239 --> 22:48.617
-These men were on the ship,

22:49.201 --> 22:53.747
and certain things were going on,
and they couldn't stand it any longer.

22:54.831 --> 22:57.584
It could have happened
on the ship I was on,

22:58.126 --> 22:59.419
but we didn't mutiny.

23:01.630 --> 23:02.881
I was on duty.

23:04.216 --> 23:09.221
So I'm right there looking down
on German prisoners.

23:10.931 --> 23:13.475
-I remember I had my Colt .45 and...

23:15.060 --> 23:17.229
And, you know, do I have an impulse?

23:19.189 --> 23:21.024
Can I take this gun...

23:21.566 --> 23:23.693
and shoot that Nazi?

23:25.278 --> 23:26.113
Kill him?

23:27.155 --> 23:28.657
Do I really want to?

23:31.701 --> 23:34.413
I tested my--
I said, "I don't want to shoot him."

23:36.748 --> 23:37.999
I didn't want to kill.

23:40.919 --> 23:42.879
So I knew I am not a killer.

23:44.756 --> 23:46.299
This is the finale.

23:48.051 --> 23:52.597
Now we're up there for, not only weeks,
but it was going on months.

23:53.432 --> 23:58.019
As soon as we get to Boston
for what they called rest and relaxation,

23:58.228 --> 24:00.063
I telephoned my home.

24:01.731 --> 24:04.693
And I heard a lot of moaning and crying.

24:05.861 --> 24:08.280
I said, "What's wrong?
What's happened?"

24:09.156 --> 24:10.490
"Your father died.

24:11.032 --> 24:12.576
Today was the funeral."

24:20.417 --> 24:23.545
For almost two years,
I didn't talk to him.

24:24.671 --> 24:27.757
A really sad part of my life,

24:28.049 --> 24:31.553
but I did not and that was stupid of me.

24:33.847 --> 24:35.348
Absolutely stupid.

24:42.063 --> 24:44.232
There's a quote I use.

24:45.484 --> 24:46.485
A lot.

24:47.527 --> 24:50.947
"Ballast yourself with reality...

24:51.990 --> 24:55.744
-then throw yourself into the sea.

24:56.745 --> 24:58.914
The sea is inspiration."

25:01.249 --> 25:02.876
And so, in acting,

25:03.919 --> 25:06.671
because I start off with the reality,

25:07.506 --> 25:09.216
then I can go further...

25:10.258 --> 25:12.636
because it's alive.

25:13.345 --> 25:14.429
It's free.

25:15.847 --> 25:16.723
It's like...

25:18.892 --> 25:20.060
the sea.

25:22.646 --> 25:24.397
The sea of inspiration.

25:27.442 --> 25:29.903
I can swim in these waters.

25:44.167 --> 25:47.045
<i>And you know, what's wonderful</i>
<i>about Wynn is that he has two lives</i>

25:47.128 --> 25:48.046
<i>and two legacies.</i>

25:48.255 --> 25:51.508
<i>One life is his work</i>
<i>as an artistic director</i>

25:51.716 --> 25:54.719
<i>of a very distinguished theater,</i>

25:57.180 --> 25:58.640
<i>The American Place Theatre.</i>

25:58.723 --> 26:02.310
<i>A private organization of excellence.</i>

26:02.394 --> 26:05.313
<i>Wynn ran what I call a boutique theater.</i>

26:05.397 --> 26:09.109
<i>American Place Theatre,</i>
<i>for people who cared about theater.</i>

26:09.985 --> 26:12.862
<i>Pure theater in its purest form.</i>

26:13.321 --> 26:17.158
<i>Looking back on it,</i>
<i>it was the most exciting theater</i>

26:17.367 --> 26:18.285
<i>of its day.</i>

26:18.451 --> 26:20.453
<i>A place where you could experiment.</i>

26:20.537 --> 26:22.581
<i>Wynn was doing experimental plays.</i>

26:22.664 --> 26:25.083
<i>He was doing plays with new authors.</i>

26:25.166 --> 26:28.420
<i>The American Place Theatre</i>
<i>always took chances.</i>

26:28.712 --> 26:30.755
<i>It's a safe haven where you can fail.</i>

26:30.839 --> 26:33.633
<i>It was okay.</i>
<i>You could afford to fail...</i>

26:33.717 --> 26:34.968
<i>And then fail again.</i>

26:35.051 --> 26:37.220
<i>...which allowed some wonderful things</i>
<i>to happen.</i>

26:38.430 --> 26:40.682
<i>The head of the theater</i>
<i>is kind of a curator.</i>

26:40.765 --> 26:43.685
<i>His taste, his curatorial vision,</i>

26:44.102 --> 26:45.353
<i>was always paramount.</i>

26:45.437 --> 26:48.023
<i>He had the ability to spot talent.</i>

26:48.189 --> 26:50.942
<i>All these people</i>
<i>who got their start at The American Place,</i>

26:51.192 --> 26:53.361
<i>playwrights, actors...</i>

26:53.528 --> 26:56.656
<i>They were first-rate,</i>
<i>wonderful actors.</i>

26:56.865 --> 26:59.075
<i>Some of them became big stars.</i>

26:59.701 --> 27:02.245
<i>I know this was true</i>
<i>for all the shows he brought in there.</i>

27:02.537 --> 27:04.205
<i>He always wanted to see them.</i>

27:04.331 --> 27:07.459
<i>He loved them.</i>
<i>He loved the people who were performing.</i>

27:07.959 --> 27:11.338
<i>And that says a lot</i>
<i>about any artistic director.</i>

27:12.589 --> 27:13.965
<i>He was there for you.</i>

27:14.716 --> 27:15.800
<i>Very sensitive...</i>

27:16.718 --> 27:20.263
<i>very strong and a clear visionary.</i>

27:20.555 --> 27:22.641
<i>I mean, he was idealistic.</i>

27:22.766 --> 27:23.892
<i>But the key thing</i>

27:23.975 --> 27:29.064
<i>Is that on any given night when I was</i>
<i>performing at The American Place Theatre,</i>

27:29.439 --> 27:30.940
<i>Wynn was somewhere in the building.</i>

27:33.109 --> 27:36.905
<i>423 West 46th Street St.</i>

27:37.697 --> 27:38.990
<i>St. Clement's Church.</i>

27:40.241 --> 27:43.161
<i> You really felt</i>
<i>the sacredness of the stage,</i>

27:43.244 --> 27:45.664
<i>you felt the sense of community.</i>

27:46.081 --> 27:49.417
<i>You just felt like you were part</i>
<i>of something happening.</i>

27:50.794 --> 27:53.672
<i>The episcopal church,</i>
<i>I don't think...</i>

27:54.714 --> 28:00.261
<i>converted as many people</i>
<i>as Wynn and The American Place. </i>

28:02.138 --> 28:05.225
<i>They were recognized</i>
<i>by the city of New York</i>

28:05.308 --> 28:10.355
<i>to give them a beautiful new theater</i>
<i>in a wonderful location.</i>

28:10.438 --> 28:12.440
<i>One block away from Broadway.</i>

28:13.149 --> 28:14.526
<i>It was almost Broadway.</i>

28:14.776 --> 28:16.403
<i>It wasn't underground theater.</i>

28:16.486 --> 28:18.363
<i>It was theater underground, </i>

28:19.072 --> 28:20.073
<i>literally.</i>

28:23.493 --> 28:26.663
<i>You often forget when you're in that space</i>

28:26.996 --> 28:28.873
<i>how far beneath the ground you are.</i>

28:29.040 --> 28:30.500
<i>Forty-two feet deep.</i>

28:30.834 --> 28:34.713
<i>If there happened to be</i>
<i>a nuclear attack while you were on...</i>

28:36.339 --> 28:39.759
<i>people from the big Broadway shows</i>
<i>would be incinerated.</i>

28:40.677 --> 28:43.722
<i>And your audience</i>
<i>wouldn't even know about it.</i>

28:44.180 --> 28:45.432
<i>I liked that part of it.</i>

28:46.391 --> 28:49.018
<i>Wynn was looking for new theater.</i>

28:49.644 --> 28:54.816
<i>-</i> <i>He was doing plays that were--</i>
<i>-</i> <i>...truly original, experimental,</i>

28:55.358 --> 28:56.234
<i>cutting edge.</i>

28:56.317 --> 28:58.153
<i>He blazed paths before others.</i>

28:58.403 --> 29:00.864
<i>You know, you hear the word "pioneered."</i>

29:00.947 --> 29:05.076
<i>The commitment that Wynn showed</i>
<i>to African-American theater artists.</i>

29:05.160 --> 29:06.911
<i>Such a diverse range</i>
<i>of playwrights.</i>

29:06.995 --> 29:10.999
<i>I can't recall</i>
<i>any Asian-American play that existed...</i>

29:11.875 --> 29:13.543
<i>until Frank Chin came along.</i>

29:14.586 --> 29:16.421
<i>I think it was the first time</i>

29:16.838 --> 29:20.008
<i>that lesbians were portrayed</i>
<i>just as normal, regular people</i>

29:20.091 --> 29:23.428
<i>who had been living</i>
<i>a sort of regular life.</i>

29:23.511 --> 29:24.804
<i>It was groundbreaking.</i>

29:24.888 --> 29:26.598
<i>There were all these emerging voices</i>

29:26.681 --> 29:30.101
<i>that the critics were shutting down,</i>
<i>and he actually bypassed the critics</i>

29:30.185 --> 29:31.853
<i>by getting subscribers.</i>

29:32.103 --> 29:34.022
<i>You couldn't get a ticket</i>

29:34.773 --> 29:38.151
<i>to The American Place Theatre</i>
<i>unless you belonged to it.</i>

29:38.234 --> 29:41.946
<i>We would often give talks</i>
<i>after a performance.</i>

29:42.030 --> 29:45.700
<i>These plays</i>
<i>that weren't like a normal play.</i>

29:45.784 --> 29:48.828
<i>Wynn was such a pioneer</i>
<i>with the post-play discussion.</i>

29:48.912 --> 29:50.288
<i>They're so standard now.</i>

29:50.747 --> 29:51.956
<i>What did we just see?</i>

29:52.248 --> 29:54.918
<i>He had a very specific kind of mission.</i>

29:55.001 --> 29:58.213
<i>...mission of explaining</i>
<i>what this kind of theater was.</i>

29:58.296 --> 30:00.089
<i>-</i> <i>His mission...</i>
<i>-</i> <i>...which was</i>

30:00.173 --> 30:04.385
<i>...to create a place</i>
<i>where new American voices could be heard.</i>

30:04.469 --> 30:07.347
<i>To bring writers,</i>
<i>like novelists and poets</i>

30:07.722 --> 30:10.600
<i>into the theater</i>
<i>and see if they could write plays.</i>

30:10.975 --> 30:14.479
<i>Nurturing these amazing playwrights.</i>

30:14.562 --> 30:16.689
<i>He loved his writers.</i>

30:19.692 --> 30:22.987
<i>American voices</i>
<i>that now are the fabric of our theater.</i>

30:23.696 --> 30:24.906
<i>With The American Place,</i>

30:24.989 --> 30:26.658
<i>you never knew</i>
<i>what they were gonna do next.</i>

30:26.741 --> 30:27.826
<i>Really, didn't know.</i>

30:27.992 --> 30:31.830
<i>These were writers that were outside</i>

30:31.913 --> 30:33.456
<i>of the mainstream.</i>

30:34.249 --> 30:37.252
<i>And being outside of that mainstream...</i>

30:38.545 --> 30:41.756
<i>Wynn was looked on as an outcast,</i>
<i>you know?</i>

30:45.176 --> 30:46.594
<i>Wynn was doing...</i>

30:48.054 --> 30:49.973
<i>-what Wynn wished to do. </i>

30:52.892 --> 30:55.144
<i>Moving to the beat of his own drum.</i>

30:56.062 --> 30:57.897
<i>He never varied in that respect.</i>

31:02.569 --> 31:03.403
Okay.

31:05.029 --> 31:06.573
Tell me when we can begin.

31:07.907 --> 31:10.034
I'm gonna continue where I left off.

31:11.160 --> 31:12.954
It's 1946.

31:13.079 --> 31:14.956
Sound?
What take is this, four?

31:15.039 --> 31:17.375
I'd just been hoping I'd lived
through the war,

31:18.251 --> 31:19.085
and I did.

31:19.168 --> 31:20.837
- This is Wynn 61A, tape four.

31:20.920 --> 31:22.922
And now what am I gonna do?

31:24.674 --> 31:28.177
I have no skills.
I'm not that good at anything.

31:28.469 --> 31:32.056
I was an English major.
I don't know what I'm gonna do with that.

31:32.807 --> 31:36.144
I'm not eager to do anything.

31:36.227 --> 31:37.604
I have no hobbies.

31:38.021 --> 31:43.610
I began to think and I said,
"Well, one of my cousins was Lou Handman."

31:44.527 --> 31:45.945
Songwriter.

31:46.696 --> 31:48.448
He wrote some hits.

31:48.823 --> 31:52.493
<i>♪ My sweetie went away</i>
<i>But she didn't say when ♪</i>

31:52.660 --> 31:55.955
<i>-♪ She didn't say when ♪</i>
<i>-</i> He had one hit in 1922,

31:56.039 --> 31:57.540
the year I was born.

31:58.833 --> 32:02.378
<i>♪ Are you lonesome tonight ♪</i>

32:02.795 --> 32:06.925
It later was a platinum record
for Elvis Presley.

32:07.216 --> 32:10.094
-I always had my little band.

32:10.637 --> 32:12.847
I had a five-piece band.

32:13.723 --> 32:14.807
Each summer...

32:16.517 --> 32:18.186
in the Catskill Mountains,

32:19.103 --> 32:20.730
I'd play tenor sax,

32:22.023 --> 32:23.316
enjoying myself,

32:24.275 --> 32:27.987
having fun with girlfriends and stuff.

32:29.530 --> 32:31.950
When I was on the Storis,

32:32.200 --> 32:34.994
I started to learn the records

32:35.119 --> 32:38.373
-of Dwight Fiske's monologues.

32:39.123 --> 32:42.377
I would do them for my shipmates.

32:42.460 --> 32:45.838
-"And out stepped Mr. Pettibone,

32:45.922 --> 32:49.676
just as naked as a child,
and twice as cocky."

32:51.386 --> 32:52.971
People responded.

32:53.054 --> 32:56.391
-I got attention and laughs.

32:58.017 --> 32:59.268
I liked that.

32:59.644 --> 33:03.231
Maybe I ought to try acting.
Maybe I could do this.

33:04.065 --> 33:09.821
So it occurred to me
that I have four years of the GI bill.

33:09.946 --> 33:12.782
The GI bill paid for your schooling.

33:13.700 --> 33:15.702
Why shouldn't I take advantage of it?

33:16.077 --> 33:19.080
Plunge right in and learn to be an actor.

33:20.498 --> 33:22.917
So I called up The Neighborhood Playhouse.

33:24.252 --> 33:26.254
I hear that's the best school.

33:27.005 --> 33:28.214
When I got there,

33:28.923 --> 33:31.134
I had to fill out these forms.

33:35.013 --> 33:37.640
There was a lot of stuff on there
I didn't know anything about.

33:37.724 --> 33:40.643
It said professional references.

33:41.227 --> 33:43.896
I put my brother-in-law, a dentist.

33:45.148 --> 33:47.275
Then it said dance training.

33:47.859 --> 33:49.152
And that was big.

33:49.986 --> 33:53.281
I put usual ballroom steps.

33:54.323 --> 33:58.536
Because I had taken some lessons
at Arthur Murray.

33:59.037 --> 34:03.166
Arthur Murray taught me dancing
in a hurry.

34:07.378 --> 34:12.300
Fortunately, they had me interviewed
by Sanford Meisner.

34:14.427 --> 34:17.513
I improvised a lot as a jazz musician.

34:20.391 --> 34:22.310
And that word seemed good to him.

34:23.936 --> 34:25.228
Improvise.

34:27.065 --> 34:29.400
I really felt good with him.

34:30.650 --> 34:32.402
And I spontaneously said,

34:33.154 --> 34:35.614
"You know,
I really want to get into this school."

34:36.574 --> 34:39.159
He said, "I wouldn't worry about it,
if I were you."

34:40.703 --> 34:42.538
And I discovered...

34:43.581 --> 34:46.083
he wanted to take untutored people.

34:46.793 --> 34:48.002
Untutored.

34:48.753 --> 34:54.801
He tended not to take tutored people
because tutored people meant bad habits

34:54.884 --> 34:56.761
and a whole misconception.

34:57.386 --> 34:59.889
And he didn't want to bother
breaking that down

35:00.056 --> 35:01.474
to get to the real thing.

35:02.850 --> 35:04.519
But he was a brilliant teacher.

35:05.061 --> 35:07.271
Sandy was brilliant.

35:08.106 --> 35:09.690
He was just brilliant.

35:10.191 --> 35:11.400
If you could take it.

35:12.151 --> 35:17.865
Sandy taught by kind of hypnotizing you.

35:18.324 --> 35:23.162
You had the feeling with Sandy, always,
that he had a great big microscope

35:23.246 --> 35:24.997
and was looking into your brain.

35:25.748 --> 35:27.625
And you were always a little uncomfortable

35:27.708 --> 35:30.211
that he knew more about yourself
than you did.

35:30.294 --> 35:32.171
And so there was something intimidating
about it.

35:32.755 --> 35:34.173
Everybody was afraid of him.

35:34.507 --> 35:37.093
Everybody was terrified of Sandy.

35:37.677 --> 35:39.011
We were always petrified.

35:39.095 --> 35:40.680
For better and worse.

35:41.305 --> 35:46.811
Sandy got emotion from you
by scaring the shit out of you.

35:46.894 --> 35:47.937
Then you'd...

35:48.646 --> 35:51.524
sometimes surprise yourself
with what you did.

35:54.110 --> 35:59.866
I had never felt so right
about being at a place

35:59.949 --> 36:01.659
and what was going on.

36:03.035 --> 36:05.413
I could swim in those waters.

36:06.455 --> 36:08.249
And inside of two weeks,

36:08.332 --> 36:11.419
Sandy, who was very perceptive,
picked it up.

36:13.504 --> 36:17.466
He would say, "Look, you work with her"
or "You work with him."

36:18.217 --> 36:22.180
Because I immediately grasped
what he was getting at.

36:23.639 --> 36:25.391
He treated me like...

36:26.809 --> 36:28.644
a student assistant.

36:30.646 --> 36:33.149
Because he was really grooming me,
I think...

36:35.651 --> 36:37.528
to come back and be his assistant.

36:40.406 --> 36:41.407
He said...

36:43.451 --> 36:46.579
"You will go through
an apprenticeship of humility."

36:51.042 --> 36:52.043
And I did.

36:53.252 --> 36:57.006
Sydney Pollack was an acting student
at The Neighborhood Playhouse

36:57.089 --> 36:59.300
when I was assisting Sandy.

37:00.092 --> 37:02.762
I was 17 years old
when I went to The Playhouse.

37:03.054 --> 37:09.060
The week's work would be usually
three sessions during the week with Sandy

37:09.143 --> 37:12.438
and four or five sessions
during the week with Wynn.

37:12.521 --> 37:15.900
The first time I met Wynn
was at The Neighborhood Playhouse,

37:15.983 --> 37:17.860
where I was a student.

37:18.736 --> 37:21.072
He was Sandy's assistant.

37:22.657 --> 37:25.493
And Wynn was reasonable and rational,

37:27.703 --> 37:29.664
charming and friendly.

37:30.998 --> 37:34.377
He was the one
you didn't have to be afraid of.

37:34.835 --> 37:37.546
<i>I was never petrified</i>
<i>when I was working with Wynn.</i>

37:37.964 --> 37:43.135
<i>I mean, Wynn was enormously successful</i>
<i>in relaxing people,</i>

37:44.595 --> 37:46.138
<i>because they trusted him.</i>

37:47.390 --> 37:50.601
<i>A kind of a super gentle way</i>
<i>of teaching</i>

37:51.185 --> 37:55.982
<i>that was a marvelous blend with Sandy.</i>

37:57.149 --> 37:59.860
<i>I always thought</i>
<i>they were a sensational team.</i>

37:59.944 --> 38:03.614
<i>But they were 180 degrees opposite</i>
<i>in their styles.</i>

38:04.282 --> 38:05.366
<i>It was the same...</i>

38:06.367 --> 38:10.579
<i>stuff as Sandy's, but a slightly different</i>
<i>attitudinal approach to it.</i>

38:11.372 --> 38:15.167
Working with Wynn
was like Sandy, plus...

38:16.210 --> 38:17.295
a...

38:19.255 --> 38:21.299
value to the human being.

38:23.050 --> 38:24.802
When I was with Sandy,

38:26.345 --> 38:30.057
he didn't do these repetition exercises.

38:30.891 --> 38:31.851
Which were,

38:31.934 --> 38:33.269
"Well, what do you think of this?"

38:33.352 --> 38:34.478
"I don't think of that."

38:34.562 --> 38:36.355
"I do that."

38:36.439 --> 38:38.190
"Well, fuck you."

38:38.274 --> 38:41.068
And a back and forth repetition.

38:41.152 --> 38:43.863
They do that for a whole semester.

38:44.447 --> 38:47.325
Over and over and over again.
That's Meisner.

38:49.201 --> 38:50.703
Repetition...

38:50.870 --> 38:51.871
Your hair is shiny.

38:51.954 --> 38:53.122
Your hair is shiny.

38:53.205 --> 38:54.832
set in with Sandy.

38:55.249 --> 38:58.711
Because the more and more stressed,

38:59.503 --> 39:02.048
-live off the other person.

39:02.673 --> 39:04.967
-You have warm eyes.
-You have warm eyes.

39:05.051 --> 39:07.887
-You have warm eyes.
- Even a sign was up.

39:09.221 --> 39:11.640
"One ounce of behavior...

39:12.516 --> 39:14.393
is worth a pound of words."

39:15.686 --> 39:16.937
Oh, come on.

39:18.439 --> 39:20.566
The greatest roles are in Shakespeare.

39:21.317 --> 39:25.029
They're the words.
They're not depending on behavior.

39:29.533 --> 39:31.577
I had been assisting Sandy

39:32.578 --> 39:34.872
for four or five years.

39:35.623 --> 39:37.583
Basic acting teaching,

39:38.334 --> 39:41.504
which got kind of boring and repetitious.

39:41.587 --> 39:43.589
Basic acting, basic acting,

39:43.756 --> 39:47.343
basic acting, basic acting,
basic acting...

39:48.219 --> 39:50.888
I don't know who concluded
that I should leave,

39:52.306 --> 39:53.474
but I had to leave.

39:55.142 --> 40:00.231
It felt like the time has come,
and the bird has to leave the nest.

40:02.566 --> 40:04.151
-February.

40:05.069 --> 40:06.362
1948.

40:07.238 --> 40:09.657
My second year
at The Neighborhood Playhouse.

40:12.034 --> 40:13.702
I met Bobbie Handman.

40:16.789 --> 40:18.457
She really liked poetry.

40:20.459 --> 40:23.045
So I hit her with T.S. Eliot:

40:23.462 --> 40:28.217
"Through the room the women
come and go. Talking of Michelangelo."

40:29.760 --> 40:31.762
Things flowed with us.

40:33.848 --> 40:35.766
Streams that flowed together.

40:37.518 --> 40:40.813
It felt so right that we knew
we were gonna get married.

40:41.480 --> 40:43.065
There was no proposal.

40:43.691 --> 40:45.359
No figuring things out.

40:47.403 --> 40:51.907
Somehow a date came along to get married,
and we did that.

41:06.547 --> 41:07.548
I was...

41:08.424 --> 41:10.593
approaching 40 years old.

41:12.970 --> 41:15.139
I realize as I look back...

41:16.891 --> 41:20.436
there was such a thing
as a midlife crisis.

41:21.854 --> 41:24.482
-I was starting to...

41:26.317 --> 41:28.694
think about The American Place Theatre.

41:32.072 --> 41:33.073
I had a name,

41:35.117 --> 41:37.203
-but I didn't have a theater.

41:39.288 --> 41:41.040
This is in the early '90s, I think.

41:41.123 --> 41:44.502
I was making some short films
and I had a meeting with Wynn.

41:45.377 --> 41:46.212
And I said,

41:46.295 --> 41:48.047
-"I don't know anything about actors.

41:48.130 --> 41:51.175
I need some help
because I'm making these films

41:51.258 --> 41:52.927
and I have no idea what they want."

41:54.678 --> 41:56.889
And I told him, "Look, I'm a photographer.

41:57.473 --> 41:59.183
I don't understand actors at all."

42:01.185 --> 42:03.771
So I came to class.
I sat in the back for the first

42:03.979 --> 42:05.022
month or two.

42:05.564 --> 42:08.275
And then I asked Wynn
if I could direct a scene.

42:08.943 --> 42:10.569
And so he said, "Sure."

42:10.653 --> 42:13.781
And because I was a photographer
he gave me <i> I Am a Camera.</i>

42:15.908 --> 42:17.868
And there's not a lot of action
in this scene

42:17.952 --> 42:20.079
-and I went to Wynn and I said,

42:20.162 --> 42:22.748
"You know there's nothing
that's happening in here."

42:23.249 --> 42:26.877
He goes, "No, there's a lot there.
Just look at it."

42:28.087 --> 42:30.256
The deep history of ordinary things,

42:31.131 --> 42:32.883
of the overseen, of the overlooked,

42:33.884 --> 42:35.594
that's really what interests me.

42:36.762 --> 42:40.224
And, I swear, I still remember
those words till this day.

42:40.933 --> 42:43.143
"There's much more there. Just look at it.

42:43.644 --> 42:45.062
There's a lot there."

42:46.814 --> 42:50.484
One of the phrases I remember Wynn
always saying was, "Let it happen."

42:51.652 --> 42:54.280
He would say this over and over.
"Let it happen."

43:03.163 --> 43:05.207
<i>I was very satisfied teaching</i>

43:05.291 --> 43:07.585
<i>and freelance directing</i>
<i>all through the '50s,</i>

43:07.668 --> 43:10.421
<i>but I also felt there's more</i>
<i>I wanted to do,</i>

43:10.713 --> 43:14.383
<i>so I decided to get a master's degree</i>
<i>in Speech Therapy</i>

43:14.466 --> 43:16.218
<i>at Teacher's College, Columbia.</i>

43:17.011 --> 43:19.138
<i>On the reading list there was this book.</i>

43:19.680 --> 43:23.100
<i>America and Alfred Stieglitz,</i>
<i>A Collective Portrait.</i>

43:24.768 --> 43:27.730
<i>Alfred Stieglitz</i>
<i>was an extremely important man</i>

43:27.813 --> 43:28.897
<i>in American art.</i>

43:31.108 --> 43:32.192
<i>"I am the moment.</i>

43:33.527 --> 43:36.405
<i>And anyone is free</i>
<i>to be in the moment with me."</i>

43:39.658 --> 43:42.786
<i>Alfred Stieglitz is allowing photography</i>

43:42.870 --> 43:44.371
<i>to become its own art form.</i>

43:45.623 --> 43:48.959
<i>And saying, "Okay, this is the role</i>
<i>of photography in the modern world."</i>

43:54.131 --> 43:57.760
<i>You have to realize,</i>
<i>in the earlier part of the 20th century,</i>

43:58.093 --> 44:02.556
<i>American artists were not given</i>
<i>the freedom to create as Americans,</i>

44:02.890 --> 44:04.391
<i>and Stieglitz felt that.</i>

44:06.310 --> 44:11.482
<i>Around 1917, he started An American Place.</i>

44:11.649 --> 44:14.777
<i>Stieglitz saw the gallery,</i>
<i>An American Place,</i>

44:15.027 --> 44:18.530
<i>as a kind of fusion of work and dream.</i>

44:21.367 --> 44:23.702
<i>Something between a laboratory</i>
<i>and a church,</i>

44:23.786 --> 44:26.580
<i>and a museum, and a library,</i>
<i>and a theater.</i>

44:29.541 --> 44:31.669
<i>So that name really appealed to me.</i>

44:32.920 --> 44:34.797
<i>And the best-known essay</i>
<i>in that book...</i>

44:34.922 --> 44:38.509
<i>It was a short piece</i>
<i>that Gertrude Stein wrote.</i>

44:38.967 --> 44:40.636
<i>It begins with these lines:</i>

44:41.679 --> 44:45.265
<i>"If anything is done</i>
<i>and something is done then somebody--"</i>

44:45.349 --> 44:47.101
<i>"Then somebody has to do it.</i>

44:47.184 --> 44:48.852
<i>Or somebody has to have done it.</i>

44:49.687 --> 44:51.021
<i>That is Stieglitz's way."</i>

44:51.146 --> 44:52.898
<i>That is Stieglitz's way.</i>

44:53.190 --> 44:54.441
<i>He has done it."</i>

44:55.943 --> 44:58.237
<i>When Stieglitz has An American Place,</i>

44:58.320 --> 44:59.905
<i>It's like nothing else.</i>

44:59.988 --> 45:02.950
<i>There's no other place like it</i>
<i>probably in the world.</i>

45:03.659 --> 45:05.619
<i>There's something happening here...</i>

45:06.328 --> 45:07.871
<i>that's never happened before.</i>

45:08.163 --> 45:10.708
<i>And I think Wynn</i>
<i>also wanted to make things happen</i>

45:10.791 --> 45:12.543
<i>that had never really happened before.</i>

45:14.712 --> 45:17.381
<i>-Wynn wanted to create...</i>

45:18.215 --> 45:21.301
<i>a place, a space,</i>
<i>where things could happen.</i>

45:25.431 --> 45:30.394
<i>And he understood that</i>
<i>Stieglitz had done something similar.</i>

45:31.895 --> 45:34.314
Now, that meant a lot to me
as I started to think

45:34.398 --> 45:35.983
about what I wanted to do.

45:46.910 --> 45:50.080
-I wanted to do something meaningful.

45:50.748 --> 45:54.376
In 1961, on the dunes of Fire Island,

45:56.170 --> 46:00.674
I began to conceive of a theater
which I felt was very needed.

46:02.426 --> 46:05.679
A place,
I wanted to use that term, "place."

46:19.610 --> 46:22.154
Those were long notes, I wrote to myself.

46:27.910 --> 46:30.287
Out of that grew
The American Place Theatre.

46:33.791 --> 46:38.253
Sidney Lanier was an episcopal priest.

46:38.337 --> 46:42.758
-He had been experimenting with the arts

46:42.841 --> 46:45.677
as part of the church services.

46:49.598 --> 46:54.269
I started to go on in my fashion
about The American Place Theatre.

46:55.145 --> 47:00.025
Well, he said, "You know,
I know of an old church on 46th Street.

47:02.361 --> 47:04.947
Maybe we can make that into a theater."

47:09.827 --> 47:15.332
The whole concept
is to get more challenging theater.

47:16.625 --> 47:21.046
We're not going to restrict ourselves
to plays we think are going to make money.

47:23.340 --> 47:26.510
I went to a lawyer and I said,

47:26.927 --> 47:31.890
"I'm wondering,
is there such a thing as a not-for-profit

47:32.057 --> 47:33.600
that you can do in theater,

47:34.059 --> 47:38.772
and we'd get the support that way,
because we're a worthwhile institution

47:39.523 --> 47:41.900
and a temple of the ascent of man."

47:43.735 --> 47:46.822
She said, "You can do a not-for-profit,

47:48.657 --> 47:50.367
but it takes a lunatic.

47:51.869 --> 47:53.370
Are you the lunatic?"

47:53.495 --> 47:55.747
I said, "Yes, I'm the lunatic."

47:59.293 --> 48:00.502
<i>The Old Glory...</i>

48:01.879 --> 48:07.301
was a play <i> </i> to launch
The American Place Theatre.

48:08.635 --> 48:12.097
The author is Robert Lowell. He's a poet.

48:13.640 --> 48:15.100
It just was crazy.

48:16.435 --> 48:18.103
This was written in verse.

48:18.520 --> 48:22.316
Each play was written in verse.

48:23.191 --> 48:26.403
Nothing could have been
more important or different

48:26.528 --> 48:30.198
than what Wynn did
by bringing Robert Lowell into the scene.

48:31.909 --> 48:33.660
He didn't do it
because it was a statement.

48:33.744 --> 48:37.497
He did it because, aesthetically
and intellectually, it was stunning work.

48:39.458 --> 48:41.668
You had <i>Benito Cereno,</i>

48:41.835 --> 48:45.130
which was about a revolt
on a slave ship...

48:47.549 --> 48:51.678
and two shorter plays
based on American history.

48:53.347 --> 48:54.765
Huge cast.

48:55.724 --> 49:00.395
At least 20 actors
who are African-American.

49:02.773 --> 49:05.776
All of this would run about four hours.

49:08.820 --> 49:09.905
<i>Once you do that,</i>

49:09.988 --> 49:14.117
<i>you set a standard for theater</i>
<i>that people say, "That should be on."</i>

49:14.201 --> 49:17.996
<i>And it doesn't really make any difference</i>
<i>if it makes a fortune or not.</i>

49:19.706 --> 49:22.876
I just felt,
"This is it. I have to open with it."

49:24.544 --> 49:28.590
I just had a fixed idea
that Frank Langella should play

49:28.674 --> 49:30.425
the part of Benito Cereno.

49:32.302 --> 49:35.973
Wynn must have asked for me to come in
because I'd been a student,

49:36.139 --> 49:40.143
and I remember Robert Lowell was there,
and Wynn was there.

49:40.686 --> 49:43.730
And they gave me a speech and I read it.

49:45.691 --> 49:48.402
Robert Lowell turned around,
looked at me,

49:48.735 --> 49:52.990
and nodded his approval,
so I cast Frank Langella.

49:57.077 --> 49:58.787
Who was going to direct all this?

49:59.663 --> 50:01.289
So Robert Lowell said,

50:01.707 --> 50:04.835
"I want Jonathan Miller
to direct the play."

50:07.087 --> 50:08.505
"Well, has he ever directed?"

50:08.588 --> 50:09.423
"No."

50:10.590 --> 50:12.050
That's who he wanted,

50:12.509 --> 50:16.805
so Jonathan Miller
was appointed to do it.

50:18.473 --> 50:20.559
Jonathan Miller was the director.

50:21.143 --> 50:23.061
Jonathan Miller was English.

50:23.770 --> 50:28.900
Jonathan Miller never had
a stop-and-go rehearsal.

50:29.609 --> 50:31.069
Not one.

50:32.612 --> 50:36.283
We had three or four weeks,
and it was nothing but run-throughs.

50:36.366 --> 50:40.245
One or two a day, and it staged itself.
And Jonathan would say,

50:40.328 --> 50:42.914
"Well, darling, maybe perhaps
you might want to turn there

50:42.998 --> 50:44.374
and come back this way."

50:45.709 --> 50:47.544
You have to have patience

50:49.046 --> 50:53.091
and kind of an empathy with actors
to work with them.

50:54.176 --> 50:55.510
He had none of that.

50:55.927 --> 50:58.638
But I remember Robert Lowell...

51:00.057 --> 51:02.309
tearing pages out of the script.

51:04.728 --> 51:07.105
making them into airplanes and...

51:09.107 --> 51:10.609
At the American Place,

51:11.651 --> 51:13.737
I was in a Robert Lowell piece

51:15.113 --> 51:17.824
and Jonathan who directed it.

51:19.242 --> 51:22.871
He had Roscoe Lee Browne,
and he had Frank Langella already,

51:23.371 --> 51:26.625
but he needed all these African-Americans
to be slaves.

51:28.293 --> 51:32.631
And I was able to get actors for him
because I knew...

51:33.507 --> 51:35.300
where the actors were, you know?

51:36.093 --> 51:37.552
Glory be, Master.

51:37.636 --> 51:40.597
Casting directors were not prevalent
at that time.

51:40.806 --> 51:42.390
Yellow fever, Master Yankee.

51:42.557 --> 51:44.893
It was like,
"This is a good actor."

51:44.976 --> 51:46.686
-And they were.

51:46.770 --> 51:48.438
Nothing to eat, Master Yankee.

51:49.064 --> 51:51.274
Nothing to drink, Master Yankee.

51:51.900 --> 51:54.820
Even now I don't think you understand
my position here.

51:55.904 --> 51:58.115
-I want to speak to you alone.
-I am alone.

51:58.490 --> 51:59.783
As much as I ever am.

52:00.575 --> 52:03.120
- I played this character,

52:03.203 --> 52:04.329
Benito Cereno.

52:05.163 --> 52:07.290
He was a Spanish nobleman

52:08.333 --> 52:10.377
being held prisoner on-board his ship.

52:11.169 --> 52:13.004
Don't you understand?

52:13.380 --> 52:17.384
-I am as powerless as you are.
-He is as powerless as you are.

52:17.467 --> 52:20.178
Don't you understand?
He's been holding a knife at my back.

52:20.262 --> 52:22.973
I have been talking
all day to save your life.

52:23.056 --> 52:25.142
Captain! Captain!

52:25.267 --> 52:27.602
And I remember asking Robert Lowell

52:28.436 --> 52:31.398
what the theme of <i>The</i> <i>Old Glory</i> was.

52:33.483 --> 52:38.280
And he said, "It's about all idealism
hardening into violence."

52:41.783 --> 52:44.244
The lawyer said,
"It takes a lunatic."

52:44.953 --> 52:46.496
Well, I was a lunatic.

52:48.999 --> 52:51.168
I was on fire with it.

52:52.502 --> 52:53.753
Maybe too much,

52:53.837 --> 52:56.339
because there was a biography
of Robert Lowell

52:57.174 --> 53:01.052
and it said,
"Wynn Handman had a Messiah complex."

53:01.636 --> 53:03.138
But I guess I did.

53:05.640 --> 53:06.975
My hero,

53:07.350 --> 53:08.852
George Bernard Shaw,

53:09.728 --> 53:10.645
he wrote:

53:11.563 --> 53:12.606
"More people...

53:13.565 --> 53:15.066
went to the theater...

53:16.818 --> 53:18.236
than went to church.

53:19.946 --> 53:22.782
This would be a very good thing if...

53:24.201 --> 53:26.995
the theater took itself seriously.

53:28.121 --> 53:30.415
As a factory of thought,

53:31.416 --> 53:35.337
an armory against despair and dullness,

53:36.796 --> 53:39.758
an elucidator of social conscience,

53:41.718 --> 53:44.930
and a temple for the ascent of man."

53:49.601 --> 53:52.145
<i>The Old Glory </i> was a huge success.

53:58.818 --> 54:00.946
That was a big, old church.

54:01.821 --> 54:03.657
It was great,
you could do anything in there.

54:05.283 --> 54:08.453
I think as a lighting designer,
I did about

54:08.536 --> 54:10.455
twenty-seven different productions.

54:12.332 --> 54:14.376
It was a very accommodating stage.

54:14.459 --> 54:17.796
But, every Sunday,
they still had church services.

54:17.879 --> 54:20.924
So no matter
what our scenery was up there,

54:21.549 --> 54:24.344
on a Saturday night,
after a show completed,

54:24.678 --> 54:26.054
the crew had to go

54:26.304 --> 54:29.808
and get it ready for the next day
when they would have church services.

54:30.183 --> 54:34.688
One of our problems was, if we wanted
to hang something over top that stage,

54:35.897 --> 54:40.986
We had to send a guy on a ladder
that was something like 60 feet high.

54:41.653 --> 54:44.990
We were working with hippies, you know?
I mean, we never killed anybody,

54:45.073 --> 54:46.116
but we could have.

54:46.700 --> 54:50.453
The American Place Theatre
was the hope of all of us,

54:51.329 --> 54:53.081
because we thought, "Aha,

54:54.040 --> 54:55.667
it's in the right neighborhood,

54:56.960 --> 55:00.672
and it's not some terrible, dingy,
dark rat-infested...

55:01.506 --> 55:04.884
you know, 50-seat theater downtown
that you can't find."

55:04.968 --> 55:10.849
The American Place Theatre
was unusual in the sense that...

55:12.726 --> 55:15.979
it was uptown but its ethos...

55:17.314 --> 55:18.606
straddled both worlds.

55:18.690 --> 55:22.235
The downtown people
never got past 14th street.

55:22.319 --> 55:26.656
"I get a nose bleed
when I go above 14th street."

55:26.740 --> 55:29.326
They lived in another world.

55:29.409 --> 55:30.869
Caffe Cino.

55:31.995 --> 55:33.246
Café La Mama.

55:33.955 --> 55:35.415
The Living Theatre.

55:36.166 --> 55:37.208
Sam Shepard.

55:37.834 --> 55:44.299
Wynn was smuggling uptown
a lot of the best downtown talent.

55:45.550 --> 55:48.970
Sam Shepard had a deep imagination.

55:52.223 --> 55:57.604
To me, he was always youth,
he was imaginative,

55:58.063 --> 55:59.647
and spontaneous.

56:02.067 --> 56:04.819
And it just overflowed from him.

56:05.403 --> 56:06.946
I was a writer, you know.

56:07.781 --> 56:10.658
I'd just write the stuff and then go out
and find the actors to do it,

56:10.742 --> 56:14.329
and we'd do it in cafes,
backyards, you know,

56:14.746 --> 56:17.916
in the opportunity
that was available to us.

56:17.999 --> 56:21.252
I hadn't done anything
above 14th street. Ever.

56:21.878 --> 56:25.090
I mean. I felt like The American Place
was a legitimate theater.

56:25.590 --> 56:27.467
And, you know, it was a big move for me.

56:28.385 --> 56:30.595
And it was an odd play but it was very...

56:31.679 --> 56:33.306
It was a really weird play.

56:33.932 --> 56:35.100
It's called <i>La Turista.</i>

56:35.308 --> 56:39.479
It was a very far out,
surreal kind of experience.

56:39.979 --> 56:41.064
<i>La Turista.</i>

56:44.317 --> 56:45.985
Nobody understood that...

56:48.154 --> 56:52.075
you know, but, hey,
if Wynn said it was good,

56:52.867 --> 56:54.369
and he wanted to do it,

56:55.703 --> 56:57.580
his board said, "Let's do it."

56:58.623 --> 57:00.834
It's an absolutely unique temperament

57:00.917 --> 57:02.043
that he has, you know?

57:03.795 --> 57:06.548
He'd make a great horse trainer.

57:07.549 --> 57:11.344
You see, with Sam in those days,
it was never a smooth ride.

57:12.804 --> 57:15.932
I said, "You know, I know a young actor
I think could play this part."

57:17.058 --> 57:18.685
His name is Sam Waterston.

57:19.436 --> 57:22.480
He was great for that part
because it required a kind of...

57:23.440 --> 57:25.400
American stiffness, you know?

57:26.860 --> 57:28.486
The arrogant Americans...

57:29.654 --> 57:30.572
who don't know it,

57:31.823 --> 57:35.493
-but they're gonna disappear.

57:38.705 --> 57:40.540
<i>As the society was fragmenting,</i>

57:41.040 --> 57:44.794
<i>as life increasingly seemed</i>
<i>to have lost its plot,</i>

57:45.587 --> 57:51.468
<i>plays and playwriting</i>
<i>were finding another surreal way</i>

57:52.385 --> 57:54.721
<i>of reflecting a new reality.</i>

57:56.389 --> 57:59.184
We were already breaking ground.

58:01.769 --> 58:03.563
Shocking people.

58:04.647 --> 58:07.275
We did a play called
<i>Harry, Noon and Night.</i>

58:07.442 --> 58:08.485
That was insane.

58:09.944 --> 58:13.823
And Dustin Hoffman was a transvestite.

58:14.449 --> 58:18.536
- A mysterious, creepy...
- ...insane character.

58:20.330 --> 58:21.915
And I just keep remembering the--

58:21.998 --> 58:24.083
You have to hold for sound, I'm sorry.

58:24.250 --> 58:27.003
-We have a helicopter, possibly.

58:27.086 --> 58:27.921
A good one?

58:32.050 --> 58:34.511
<i>-</i> <i>Ronald Ribman sent a play</i>
<i>-</i>

58:34.886 --> 58:36.804
<i>called </i> Harry, Noon and Night.

58:37.347 --> 58:40.767
<i>It was unlike anything</i>
<i>anyone had ever seen.</i>

58:41.935 --> 58:45.605
That was what Wynn
was looking for, I think.

58:47.273 --> 58:50.693
Plays that made the audience say,
"What is this?"

58:50.902 --> 58:53.696
You know, "Something new
is being presented to me here."

58:54.113 --> 58:56.699
I remember there was a lot of talk
at the time in the church,

58:56.783 --> 59:00.203
"Well, do you think this is an appropriate
play for a church?"

59:00.828 --> 59:04.624
Not a doubt in his mind,
"No, no, this is perfectly fine."

59:05.208 --> 59:11.881
Nothing stopped Wynn Handman
from doing anything that he wanted to do.

59:15.426 --> 59:17.679
-They came to the theater...

59:20.014 --> 59:21.266
for the shock of the new.

59:22.058 --> 59:26.271
I'm of the generation that came of age
during all that turbulent experimentation.

59:26.688 --> 59:30.608
Wynn would use that phrase,
"Let these plays happen to you."

59:30.692 --> 59:34.487
And it often triggered my remembering,
you know, from...

59:35.530 --> 59:36.990
junior high school.

59:37.073 --> 59:40.076
"A poem should not mean, but be."

59:42.287 --> 59:44.247
Which is a useful phrase for an artist.

59:45.164 --> 59:48.042
Don't try to make it mean something.
Try to make it be something.

59:48.960 --> 59:52.088
You know I remember seeing
<i>La Turista, </i> which caused a bit of a stir,

59:52.171 --> 59:58.553
because Sam insisted that a chicken
be decapitated on stage.<i> </i>

59:59.220 --> 01:00:04.350
One of the sequences,
they bring sort of ritualistic doctor in.

01:00:04.434 --> 01:00:06.436
What did they call them?
A medicine man.

01:00:06.603 --> 01:00:12.191
This doctor is going to use
fresh chicken blood and he's going to kill

01:00:12.775 --> 01:00:14.527
a chicken on stage.

01:00:14.611 --> 01:00:17.488
-And then he would squeeze...
-...the chicken blood,

01:00:18.448 --> 01:00:20.408
and drip the blood of the chicken

01:00:20.491 --> 01:00:22.076
-all over Sam...
-...Waterston.

01:00:23.828 --> 01:00:25.955
It occurred to me that...

01:00:26.289 --> 01:00:29.667
this is probably going farther
than you can go,

01:00:30.752 --> 01:00:33.087
to kill a chicken on stage.

01:00:34.547 --> 01:00:36.591
Some guys in suits came in.

01:00:36.924 --> 01:00:39.010
They were lawyers and they said,<i> </i>

01:00:39.093 --> 01:00:42.138
"It's illegal to kill an animal...

01:00:42.221 --> 01:00:44.474
...on stage for entertainment."

01:00:45.224 --> 01:00:47.226
As soon as they heard it was illegal,

01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:51.064
the property guys came up
with a wonderful way of doing it.

01:00:51.731 --> 01:00:54.108
A fake chicken
with a syringe in its backside.

01:00:54.192 --> 01:00:57.528
And it had the illusion
that they had to kill that one chicken.

01:00:57.904 --> 01:00:59.530
And that solved the problem.

01:00:59.614 --> 01:01:03.910
So much so that the audience
believed it and I got a lot of hate mail.

01:01:05.787 --> 01:01:06.621
Yeah.

01:01:07.038 --> 01:01:09.457
It was a disaster for Wynn, I think,
you know?

01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:10.917
But, I mean, I'm glad we did it.

01:01:11.292 --> 01:01:16.631
Many voiced their discontent,
and we lost subscribers.

01:01:17.173 --> 01:01:19.050
A lot of subscribers.

01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:28.267
American Place Theatre
did not have a box office.

01:01:30.061 --> 01:01:33.356
This was probably
the only theater in the world

01:01:33.523 --> 01:01:35.149
where you couldn't buy a ticket.

01:01:36.693 --> 01:01:39.445
The American Place Theatre
would have a subscription audience,

01:01:39.529 --> 01:01:41.406
who would be willing
to go to see things...

01:01:42.323 --> 01:01:44.992
before the critics said "yea" or "nay."

01:01:45.868 --> 01:01:49.163
With subscription-only, you were...

01:01:49.831 --> 01:01:51.791
guaranteed an audience,

01:01:52.750 --> 01:01:55.461
without worrying about reviews.

01:01:57.255 --> 01:01:59.048
If you worry about reviews,

01:02:00.466 --> 01:02:02.760
then you're worried about the wrong thing.

01:02:02.844 --> 01:02:05.138
Artistic director
of The American Place Theatre,

01:02:05.221 --> 01:02:07.557
Wynn Handman,
and playwright, Ronald Milner.

01:02:08.182 --> 01:02:11.352
Ron Milner did not change his plays

01:02:11.477 --> 01:02:12.437
to suit...

01:02:13.020 --> 01:02:14.981
the audience at the American Place.

01:02:16.774 --> 01:02:17.775
And Wynn loved that.

01:02:18.443 --> 01:02:23.156
Wynn was actually looking
for African-American plays.

01:02:24.157 --> 01:02:25.450
I had so many.

01:02:26.075 --> 01:02:27.660
I had a trove of them.

01:02:28.953 --> 01:02:33.583
Now, Woody King brought me a play
called <i>Who's Got His Own.</i>

01:02:34.667 --> 01:02:36.002
<i>Who's Got His Own</i>

01:02:37.712 --> 01:02:40.590
was a family play.

01:02:41.716 --> 01:02:45.595
Set on the eve of the funeral

01:02:45.887 --> 01:02:50.975
of the father of that family.
A family whose father...

01:02:52.018 --> 01:02:55.646
was a tyrant and he beat his son up.

01:02:57.023 --> 01:03:02.195
Whose father was a worker
in an automobile plant in Detroit.

01:03:03.946 --> 01:03:07.658
And then, when his son
went to see him at the plant,

01:03:07.742 --> 01:03:09.952
some of the white workers there...

01:03:10.745 --> 01:03:14.499
They said, "You're shithouse Tim's boy."

01:03:15.041 --> 01:03:16.250
He said, "What?"

01:03:17.126 --> 01:03:20.421
"Yeah, you're shithouse Tim.
That's what he does,

01:03:21.214 --> 01:03:22.924
and that's what we call him."

01:03:23.007 --> 01:03:25.718
Yeah. And they laughed
and the other one said,

01:03:25.802 --> 01:03:27.845
"He cleans them,
and he's scared to come out of them."

01:03:27.929 --> 01:03:29.555
Now, I didn't understand that, Mama.

01:03:29.764 --> 01:03:32.308
I mean, it didn't sit right with me.
It didn't seem to go

01:03:32.391 --> 01:03:34.018
with all that thunder and power.

01:03:38.105 --> 01:03:39.023
That...

01:03:44.445 --> 01:03:45.905
That was too much for him.

01:03:47.156 --> 01:03:50.952
So he carried that around
on the eve of his father's funeral.

01:03:52.578 --> 01:03:55.206
For this story to be told
was amazing, you know?

01:03:55.289 --> 01:03:58.751
I couldn't believe that they were doing
this particular piece of work.

01:03:59.544 --> 01:04:02.630
There was no white Savior
in <i>Who's Got His Own.</i>

01:04:03.047 --> 01:04:05.550
There was no one
that the caucasian audience

01:04:05.633 --> 01:04:06.843
could really root for.

01:04:08.135 --> 01:04:10.555
My impression of the critics...

01:04:10.638 --> 01:04:13.891
they were not taught these playwrights
in school.

01:04:14.433 --> 01:04:16.185
There was no reference point.

01:04:17.061 --> 01:04:18.312
And so, therefore,

01:04:19.021 --> 01:04:21.190
it was hard to write about them.

01:04:23.025 --> 01:04:26.195
These were in-your-face plays

01:04:26.571 --> 01:04:30.491
that brought the audience to them
and didn't let them go

01:04:31.242 --> 01:04:34.912
until they had experienced something

01:04:35.663 --> 01:04:37.582
about a people that they ignored.

01:04:39.375 --> 01:04:42.587
And there weren't many places doing that,

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:44.589
especially at that time.

01:04:46.132 --> 01:04:51.137
<i>To speak your mind</i>
<i>is subversive by definition</i>

01:04:51.762 --> 01:04:56.475
<i>and unsettling by definition,</i>
<i>and thought-provoking by definition.</i>

01:04:56.851 --> 01:04:58.686
Well, look,
I even had to find a reason

01:04:58.769 --> 01:05:00.980
to come back here to the funeral today,
do you dig?

01:05:02.231 --> 01:05:05.151
All of my life,
my father can't talk to me,

01:05:05.443 --> 01:05:09.322
because white faces
had choked his tongue out.

01:05:10.823 --> 01:05:13.659
Mama, he might be out there
in that cemetery, but it ain't over.

01:05:14.118 --> 01:05:17.079
It's still here. Aching, burning.

01:05:17.163 --> 01:05:19.957
I saw white, middle-aged people

01:05:20.041 --> 01:05:24.295
just kind of watch an operation
unfold before them,

01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:26.756
and it was a painful experience for them.

01:05:26.839 --> 01:05:30.635
But I do feel
that all of them knew something better,

01:05:30.718 --> 01:05:32.553
as a result of having seen the play.

01:05:32.637 --> 01:05:35.139
In the main, the audience reacted,
but the critics,

01:05:35.431 --> 01:05:39.977
who I thought might come to it
on another level and see human beings.

01:05:40.061 --> 01:05:41.312
As I told you before I...

01:05:42.146 --> 01:05:45.483
underestimated the white audience,
and overestimated white critics.

01:05:47.485 --> 01:05:51.113
Most of the people
who write drama criticism

01:05:51.197 --> 01:05:53.074
are really writing reviews.

01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:58.829
Why you want the review
is to attract customers.

01:05:59.747 --> 01:06:03.209
So, that's a function of business
and advertising.

01:06:03.584 --> 01:06:05.336
Each time I did a play,

01:06:05.419 --> 01:06:09.006
I said to the author,
"We do not have to have the critics.

01:06:09.382 --> 01:06:12.093
Because, after all, I had my subscribers.

01:06:12.343 --> 01:06:14.845
I wasn't catering to a box office."

01:06:15.638 --> 01:06:18.724
Why have it evaluated from the outside
by people who,

01:06:18.808 --> 01:06:20.393
first of all, aren't writers?

01:06:20.476 --> 01:06:23.479
I mean, they're journalists, okay.

01:06:25.064 --> 01:06:27.066
I'm not saying journalism isn't writing.

01:06:28.484 --> 01:06:31.153
I didn't feel like,
for what we were doing,

01:06:31.237 --> 01:06:34.407
it was necessary to be assessed like that.

01:06:35.533 --> 01:06:37.034
That wasn't what we were doing it for.

01:06:37.702 --> 01:06:39.745
Wynn was not in show business.

01:06:40.454 --> 01:06:44.583
What Wynn was into
was developing a theater culture,

01:06:45.084 --> 01:06:48.796
to take this tower
and to try to sustain it.

01:06:50.381 --> 01:06:55.177
<i>Who's Got His Own</i>
turned out to be very significant.

01:06:58.389 --> 01:07:01.017
Wynn had opened the world up for me.

01:07:01.851 --> 01:07:03.310
I could give him a play...

01:07:04.145 --> 01:07:08.149
and work on it not as an actor,
but as a producer.

01:07:08.232 --> 01:07:09.567
That's how I learned to produce.

01:07:09.650 --> 01:07:15.448
That's how I was able to bring
other plays to Wynn, and other writers.

01:07:15.531 --> 01:07:17.408
-I had taken to Wynn

01:07:18.034 --> 01:07:19.410
<i>Five on the Black Hand Side.</i>

01:07:19.785 --> 01:07:21.078
Wynn did that.

01:07:21.454 --> 01:07:23.289
I had taken Ed Bullins.

01:07:24.331 --> 01:07:26.125
Wynn produced his short one-acts.

01:07:26.333 --> 01:07:29.628
- It was a group of short plays.
- What was the title of that?

01:07:29.712 --> 01:07:31.338
The title was <i>The Electronic...</i>

01:07:33.174 --> 01:07:34.550
<i>-</i>
<i>-...And Others.</i>

01:07:34.675 --> 01:07:37.011
-Ed Bullins--
- Ed was his favorite writer.

01:07:37.094 --> 01:07:40.389
He was cultural minister
of the Black Panthers.

01:07:40.473 --> 01:07:45.061
There might be tension
between his subscribers.

01:07:46.228 --> 01:07:48.147
But Wynn was glorying in that.

01:07:48.272 --> 01:07:49.815
He loved that, man.

01:07:50.441 --> 01:07:54.320
And I think that's bad for an artist
to be following any mass drive.

01:07:54.403 --> 01:07:58.699
He has to attack all sides, every side.
He's an outsider anyway.

01:07:58.783 --> 01:08:00.576
- The outsider.

01:08:00.659 --> 01:08:02.161
I was an outsider.

01:08:02.745 --> 01:08:05.039
I accepted myself as an outsider.

01:08:05.831 --> 01:08:06.916
I always did.

01:08:15.132 --> 01:08:18.385
The creative act,
you never know where it's going to lead.

01:08:20.054 --> 01:08:22.848
You're not thinking
about who's picking up on it.

01:08:24.475 --> 01:08:27.269
You do the act for the act itself.

01:08:28.729 --> 01:08:31.398
George Tabori was a playwright.

01:08:32.649 --> 01:08:34.693
Every time you were with him...

01:08:35.944 --> 01:08:37.779
you had his humor,

01:08:38.988 --> 01:08:43.285
macabre, bizarre humor,
which came from his intellect

01:08:44.286 --> 01:08:47.581
and his insights about life.

01:08:48.332 --> 01:08:50.251
-George used to keep a record

01:08:50.334 --> 01:08:52.627
of all my jokes from the time I was eight.

01:08:52.711 --> 01:08:54.921
He had a little book
where he wrote my jokes.

01:08:55.046 --> 01:08:59.468
Very often, you have to make laughter
out of disasters.

01:09:00.386 --> 01:09:02.638
Because, although his father died
in Auschwitz,

01:09:03.264 --> 01:09:04.890
George became a British subject

01:09:04.974 --> 01:09:08.435
in order not to end up
in a concentration camp himself.

01:09:08.519 --> 01:09:09.979
-He escaped.

01:09:10.062 --> 01:09:13.482
He wanted things
to be taken seriously,

01:09:13.566 --> 01:09:15.401
but he did it with humor.

01:09:16.986 --> 01:09:20.488
I don't know how come
he came to me, but...

01:09:21.532 --> 01:09:22.950
he had already...

01:09:23.783 --> 01:09:27.121
done something off-Broadway
called <i>Brecht on Brecht.</i>

01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:32.251
Brecht was a brilliant German playwright.

01:09:33.210 --> 01:09:36.087
When George did <i>Brecht on Brecht</i>
at the Theatre De Lys,

01:09:36.171 --> 01:09:38.131
that was intended to run for eight weeks.

01:09:38.215 --> 01:09:42.386
There were actors sitting on stools
in front of a portrait of Brecht,

01:09:43.011 --> 01:09:46.098
and that play ran for four years.

01:09:46.473 --> 01:09:51.562
I was aware that George
was quite a scholar on <i>Brecht,</i>

01:09:52.229 --> 01:09:54.273
but when I read <i>The Cannibals...</i>

01:09:55.357 --> 01:09:58.903
It was a play set in Auschwitz.

01:10:02.406 --> 01:10:05.409
You just tell me what this picture is.

01:10:06.619 --> 01:10:10.956
Yeah, this is a picture of Puffy...

01:10:12.583 --> 01:10:15.586
who, in the play, is preserved...

01:10:16.086 --> 01:10:19.089
while the rest of the barracks
are starving.

01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:23.385
The Germans keep giving him food,
and food, and food

01:10:23.469 --> 01:10:27.014
so that they are going to take pictures

01:10:27.097 --> 01:10:32.353
of the inmates eating pieces of Puffy.

01:10:34.188 --> 01:10:35.272
A horrible thought.

01:10:35.648 --> 01:10:39.735
<i>The Cannibals</i> took the position
that Auschwitz was a place

01:10:39.818 --> 01:10:44.406
where prisoners had to perform
for their captors.

01:10:45.199 --> 01:10:48.035
And it's a play
in which one of the inmates dies

01:10:48.118 --> 01:10:50.454
and is eaten by the other inmates.

01:10:50.829 --> 01:10:53.582
I mean, that doesn't sound so enticing,
does it?

01:10:53.666 --> 01:10:56.794
But what's fascinating about it
is the way

01:10:56.877 --> 01:10:59.380
in which they came
to understand each other,

01:11:00.089 --> 01:11:01.924
the victims and the victimizers.

01:11:02.716 --> 01:11:06.303
This relationship between the victim
and the victimizer,

01:11:06.804 --> 01:11:11.100
this was what drove George's plays.

01:11:11.225 --> 01:11:14.353
- If I didn't do the play,

01:11:14.979 --> 01:11:17.648
then I had a feeling
no one was going to do it.

01:11:18.274 --> 01:11:19.942
I don't know where it would lead,

01:11:21.735 --> 01:11:23.529
but you don't think about it.

01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:26.115
Wynn is not an activist.

01:11:26.740 --> 01:11:31.203
There was a sense of tradition
in the experience of The American Place.

01:11:32.371 --> 01:11:35.457
But simultaneously, he was the angel

01:11:35.541 --> 01:11:40.170
of deeply intelligent, emerging theater.

01:11:41.255 --> 01:11:42.631
American Place was like a home.

01:11:42.715 --> 01:11:45.759
You came in there.
You felt like you were part of a family.

01:11:45.843 --> 01:11:49.847
I used to sit and watch rehearsals,
and, I mean, Wynn did not kick me out.

01:11:50.055 --> 01:11:53.267
You know? It was not like people
who weren't working on it

01:11:53.350 --> 01:11:54.351
should not be there.

01:11:55.394 --> 01:11:59.106
I was more interested in rehearsals
than I was interested in anything else.

01:11:59.815 --> 01:12:02.526
You know, they started to do
all kinds of...

01:12:02.609 --> 01:12:05.404
I mean, they did tons of improvisation.

01:12:06.530 --> 01:12:09.199
How we were going
to give the actors the...

01:12:09.742 --> 01:12:13.579
Not just the opportunity, but the right

01:12:14.455 --> 01:12:17.333
to be all that they could be?

01:12:17.833 --> 01:12:21.045
I mean, I was very much
for what they were doing,

01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:23.839
giving the actors a lot of freedom,

01:12:24.757 --> 01:12:27.259
which sort of spilled over
to the audience,

01:12:27.926 --> 01:12:32.014
but I felt the audience
got a bit uncomfortable

01:12:32.097 --> 01:12:34.099
with the way they spilled over.

01:12:34.475 --> 01:12:36.268
One of the actors

01:12:36.685 --> 01:12:39.730
jumped up on a table and he said,

01:12:39.813 --> 01:12:44.193
"Wynn, the theater is not a safe place.

01:12:45.652 --> 01:12:48.697
The theater is not a safe place."

01:12:49.156 --> 01:12:52.117
And George Tabori
certainly didn't think of it

01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:53.702
as a safe place.

01:12:53.786 --> 01:12:56.246
The kind of people who'd go
to The American Place Theatre

01:12:56.330 --> 01:12:58.123
are people that have social values.

01:12:58.290 --> 01:12:59.917
They're people that care about justice.

01:13:01.835 --> 01:13:05.297
The fact is that
what The American Place Theatre was doing

01:13:05.631 --> 01:13:09.802
was bringing a lot
of extremely interesting ideas

01:13:09.885 --> 01:13:12.221
about injustice into the theater

01:13:12.971 --> 01:13:16.892
and making it an experience
that people wanted to have.

01:13:19.103 --> 01:13:21.188
<i>Some</i> people wanted to have,

01:13:23.899 --> 01:13:25.567
So we did the play,

01:13:26.026 --> 01:13:27.194
but I remember

01:13:28.529 --> 01:13:31.865
the reviews did not come near the...

01:13:32.825 --> 01:13:35.160
value of this piece of theater.

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:40.082
But I didn't expect it anymore.

01:13:42.084 --> 01:13:44.753
Shortly after, I heard from...

01:13:44.837 --> 01:13:48.799
-the director of the Schiller Theater.

01:13:48.924 --> 01:13:52.928
Rather famous theater
but located in West Berlin.

01:13:53.053 --> 01:13:54.805
I was rather shocked to hear from

01:13:55.264 --> 01:13:58.642
somebody in Germany
wanting to do <i>The</i> <i>Cannibals.</i>

01:14:00.060 --> 01:14:04.022
Because I carried around in me
such an aversion

01:14:04.690 --> 01:14:07.609
for the Germans and for what they did.

01:14:09.486 --> 01:14:10.946
Naturally, I was...

01:14:11.613 --> 01:14:12.489
conflicted.

01:14:13.949 --> 01:14:17.411
I had said to myself,
"I never want to go to Germany."

01:14:18.162 --> 01:14:19.955
What were they doing
during the war?

01:14:20.664 --> 01:14:22.082
I don't want to set foot...

01:14:23.125 --> 01:14:24.293
in that country.

01:14:25.085 --> 01:14:26.962
This was the question
that everybody had.

01:14:27.045 --> 01:14:28.797
If they went to Germany,

01:14:29.256 --> 01:14:31.383
who were they, and what role do they play?

01:14:33.343 --> 01:14:34.261
Nazis.

01:14:35.929 --> 01:14:40.017
-And now I have to fly on Lufthansa?

01:14:45.522 --> 01:14:47.566
I made the decision to go.

01:14:52.946 --> 01:14:56.658
I went to Germany, of course.

01:14:56.992 --> 01:14:59.203
I thought this was going
to be a catastrophe.

01:15:00.537 --> 01:15:03.749
What is George doing back in Germany?
I mean, Germany?

01:15:04.416 --> 01:15:06.335
Germany killed his Dad, you know?

01:15:07.628 --> 01:15:09.963
I may just not stick around
for this opening.

01:15:11.381 --> 01:15:13.759
Tomatoes were definitely being thrown
that night.

01:15:13.842 --> 01:15:16.094
This was not going to be
a good experience.

01:15:17.137 --> 01:15:19.515
And I thought,
"No, I'm not gonna watch that."

01:15:19.806 --> 01:15:24.102
Wynn, of course, had no such concerns.
He was right smack there.

01:15:24.686 --> 01:15:28.941
We came to the opening,
and George was very nervous.

01:15:29.233 --> 01:15:31.693
He was just pacing back and forth.

01:15:32.152 --> 01:15:34.947
So, when the performance started,

01:15:35.030 --> 01:15:39.451
George was pacing in the back
of the theater. He wasn't watching.

01:15:39.952 --> 01:15:42.329
-I sat in the fourth row...

01:15:43.705 --> 01:15:46.333
and I watched the play. I knew the play.

01:15:46.708 --> 01:15:48.335
And the actors were damn good.

01:15:50.087 --> 01:15:53.715
I was sitting next to Ushi,
the translator, a young woman.

01:15:54.466 --> 01:15:56.093
She found humor in it.

01:15:56.927 --> 01:15:57.886
She laughed.

01:15:58.637 --> 01:16:04.643
And the older man sitting near me
was furious at her for laughing.

01:16:04.726 --> 01:16:08.438
He said, "You silly cow.
This is not a laughing matter."

01:16:11.024 --> 01:16:15.362
The son of the camp commander

01:16:16.822 --> 01:16:19.449
came down to the forestage.

01:16:20.450 --> 01:16:22.578
This was the finale of the play.

01:16:24.079 --> 01:16:29.835
And he started asking,
"Daddy, what did you do in the war?

01:16:30.252 --> 01:16:35.591
Daddy, what did you do in the war?"

01:16:35.674 --> 01:16:40.012
The actor, he whipped his body around.

01:16:40.262 --> 01:16:43.682
He was using his body as a whip

01:16:43.765 --> 01:16:45.058
with each question.

01:16:45.142 --> 01:16:50.939
"Daddy, what did you do in the war?"

01:16:51.398 --> 01:16:52.441
In front of me,

01:16:52.524 --> 01:16:56.445
were these beautifully coiffed
German women.

01:16:56.528 --> 01:17:01.074
"Daddy, give me an answer.
What did you do in the war?"

01:17:01.241 --> 01:17:03.035
And with each "what did you do,"

01:17:03.118 --> 01:17:07.289
these women in front of me
started to recoil,

01:17:07.581 --> 01:17:10.125
as if they were being whipped,
which they were.

01:17:10.208 --> 01:17:13.462
"Don't give me
this philosophical bullshit, Daddy.

01:17:13.795 --> 01:17:16.089
What did you do in the war?

01:17:16.548 --> 01:17:19.593
What did you do in the war?"

01:17:22.721 --> 01:17:23.889
The play ended.

01:17:24.765 --> 01:17:26.725
There was a silence.

01:17:27.809 --> 01:17:30.354
The actors came out one by one,

01:17:30.562 --> 01:17:33.190
-but with each actor coming out,

01:17:33.732 --> 01:17:35.817
there was increased applause.

01:17:37.027 --> 01:17:38.737
The opening night of a new play,

01:17:38.987 --> 01:17:41.990
-the playwright got up on the stage...

01:17:43.075 --> 01:17:44.701
and George bowed.

01:17:47.746 --> 01:17:50.791
And the applause went on and on and on.

01:17:51.667 --> 01:17:53.794
<i>Cannibals </i> wasn't a big hit
in New York...

01:17:57.089 --> 01:17:58.382
but in Berlin...

01:18:00.050 --> 01:18:03.011
you know,
the roof came off. It was huge.

01:18:04.513 --> 01:18:06.431
It opened the door for Auschwitz.

01:18:07.349 --> 01:18:11.687
For the announcing of all these things
that happened, opened the door.

01:18:12.187 --> 01:18:14.189
And then the miracle happened.

01:18:15.482 --> 01:18:18.151
And that's the miracle of Tabori.

01:18:18.568 --> 01:18:22.489
It is the greatest success
we have ever had.

01:18:23.490 --> 01:18:27.494
<i>The Cannibals </i> became a nationwide hit.

01:18:27.661 --> 01:18:31.498
Well, they did it in Dusseldorf,
and they did it in Stuttgart.

01:18:31.748 --> 01:18:37.254
We had no anticipation whatsoever
of the deep and profound guilt

01:18:37.337 --> 01:18:38.839
in the German culture.

01:18:38.922 --> 01:18:44.386
That was a part of what made that play
so phenomenally successful.

01:18:44.469 --> 01:18:46.513
- And not only that,

01:18:46.596 --> 01:18:52.018
George Tabori became a nationwide hero

01:18:52.102 --> 01:18:53.186
of the theater.

01:18:53.854 --> 01:18:57.607
So much so, he stayed on in Germany,

01:18:58.567 --> 01:19:03.488
because he became
the guru of theater in Germany.

01:19:03.697 --> 01:19:06.241
He became a superstar in Germany.

01:19:07.492 --> 01:19:12.581
The Theatre of the Holocaust
was subsequently defined by George.

01:19:13.665 --> 01:19:17.753
Success was not what Wynn was after.

01:19:18.837 --> 01:19:22.132
He wanted to bring great ideas
to an audience.

01:19:22.215 --> 01:19:24.634
He wanted to affect a generation.

01:19:27.262 --> 01:19:30.098
And he did that with George.

01:19:33.268 --> 01:19:35.645
- The creative act...

01:19:36.271 --> 01:19:38.273
you never know where it's going to lead.

01:19:45.989 --> 01:19:47.324
I've been very lucky...

01:19:48.909 --> 01:19:50.076
my whole life.

01:19:50.869 --> 01:19:55.081
The first 12 years
of The American Place Theatre's life,

01:19:55.332 --> 01:19:58.335
-I had generous funding

01:19:58.502 --> 01:20:00.295
from the Ford foundation

01:20:00.629 --> 01:20:02.923
and the Rockefeller Foundation.

01:20:04.382 --> 01:20:09.513
I was free of the real burdens
of fundraising.

01:20:15.477 --> 01:20:20.899
That was a time when the the city
was trying to preserve live theater.

01:20:21.900 --> 01:20:24.528
And, at that time,
the city got me involved.

01:20:24.611 --> 01:20:27.113
They'd say,
"Go to see Larry Fisher. Fisher Brothers.

01:20:27.197 --> 01:20:29.324
They're big builders of office buildings."

01:20:31.034 --> 01:20:32.786
I go to see Larry Fisher.

01:20:33.620 --> 01:20:36.456
Larry Fisher said,
"I'm going to build you a theater,

01:20:37.123 --> 01:20:39.042
five dollars a year, okay?"

01:20:39.751 --> 01:20:41.378
Well, how do you turn this down?

01:20:42.796 --> 01:20:44.422
At no cost to you,

01:20:45.257 --> 01:20:48.760
you can design the theater underground

01:20:49.594 --> 01:20:51.596
at 46th Street and 6th Avenue.

01:20:52.264 --> 01:20:54.140
You pay five dollars a year rent.

01:20:54.516 --> 01:20:56.726
Well, this was very hard to resist.

01:20:57.435 --> 01:20:58.895
It made a lot of sense.

01:21:00.605 --> 01:21:05.068
The new theater opened in 1971.

01:21:05.485 --> 01:21:07.404
Wynn Handman...

01:21:08.196 --> 01:21:11.491
His theater was not a large theater,

01:21:12.492 --> 01:21:14.369
but it was an important theater.

01:21:15.036 --> 01:21:19.416
And Wynn had room
for playwrights to come in

01:21:19.875 --> 01:21:21.001
and develop their work.

01:21:21.751 --> 01:21:24.004
It was always the playwright,
the playwright.

01:21:26.339 --> 01:21:31.469
A playwright may sit alone writing,

01:21:32.178 --> 01:21:35.473
but desperately needs
to hear people say words.

01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:38.435
And until the playwright
hears those words said,

01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:40.729
they don't really know
what they've written.

01:21:42.981 --> 01:21:44.983
A script came across my desk

01:21:45.066 --> 01:21:48.320
called <i>The Chickencoop Chinaman's</i>
<i>Pregnant Pause.</i>

01:21:49.821 --> 01:21:51.865
The play needed quite a bit of work.

01:21:51.948 --> 01:21:54.659
It was like pretty fat,
like the phone book.

01:21:54.743 --> 01:21:56.995
-Queens' phone book.

01:21:58.455 --> 01:22:02.042
The manuscript to the first
<i>Chickencoop Chinaman</i>

01:22:02.125 --> 01:22:04.169
was that thick, literally.

01:22:04.836 --> 01:22:05.754
That thick.

01:22:06.838 --> 01:22:09.090
Wynn Handman calls me up.

01:22:10.300 --> 01:22:12.510
I don't know who the hell
Wynn Handman is.

01:22:13.053 --> 01:22:16.640
I had a feeling we got a call
from a Chicago used car salesman.

01:22:17.766 --> 01:22:20.894
But what comes through is,
"Oh, I can go to New York!

01:22:20.977 --> 01:22:23.271
I've never been to New York."

01:22:24.481 --> 01:22:25.649
It was an adventure.

01:22:26.816 --> 01:22:30.445
Then I brought Frank Chin here
from California.

01:22:31.655 --> 01:22:34.699
And to him it was a big deal
to be in the Apple.

01:22:36.201 --> 01:22:38.411
And then I saw the new theater.

01:22:38.995 --> 01:22:42.165
This theater was in the basement,
but it was...

01:22:43.249 --> 01:22:44.084
beautiful.

01:22:45.001 --> 01:22:47.045
It was so intelligently laid out.

01:22:47.587 --> 01:22:50.465
I didn't know what to think.
I mean, this is...

01:22:51.257 --> 01:22:52.133
for me?

01:22:53.009 --> 01:22:56.304
Wynn Handman says,
"You know, there's a  Shakespearean actor

01:22:56.388 --> 01:23:00.892
that's making quite a stir,
and he's a terrific actor."

01:23:00.976 --> 01:23:02.936
"Okay, bring him in."

01:23:13.113 --> 01:23:14.823
It's Randy Kim.

01:23:15.115 --> 01:23:17.242
Goddamn!

01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:20.203
Where did this guy come from?

01:23:20.370 --> 01:23:22.998
I would never be cast in, say,
an Arthur Miller play

01:23:23.081 --> 01:23:24.666
or a Tennessee Williams play,

01:23:24.749 --> 01:23:26.835
whereas, the classical playwrights,

01:23:27.085 --> 01:23:28.503
they will open doors to me.

01:23:31.214 --> 01:23:33.925
I could do a Greek tragedy.
I could do Shakespeare.

01:23:35.677 --> 01:23:38.430
And here was
this Asian-American playwright.

01:23:39.639 --> 01:23:44.102
I don't know, I found the courage to say,
"Okay, maybe I can do something in this."

01:23:47.397 --> 01:23:50.358
There was--
The confusion of that period

01:23:50.859 --> 01:23:52.027
I wanted to work out.

01:23:52.610 --> 01:23:54.696
I wanted to find out...

01:23:56.031 --> 01:23:59.200
what was an American of Chinese descent?

01:24:01.202 --> 01:24:05.749
One of the most telling monologues
in the <i>Chickencoop Chinaman...</i>

01:24:05.832 --> 01:24:08.585
-the protagonist,

01:24:09.335 --> 01:24:11.087
played by Randall Duk Kim...

01:24:12.422 --> 01:24:13.965
on the radio...

01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:18.261
had heard these stories
about the Lone Ranger.

01:24:19.095 --> 01:24:22.724
And the Lone Ranger had a black mask,

01:24:23.141 --> 01:24:25.518
and you never saw his face.

01:24:26.436 --> 01:24:31.274
So, this kid was listening on the radio
to <i>The Lone Ranger.</i>

01:24:31.941 --> 01:24:33.693
He was convinced

01:24:34.235 --> 01:24:38.031
that the Lone Ranger was Chinese.

01:24:38.740 --> 01:24:40.909
"I have a share in your national myths.

01:24:42.327 --> 01:24:45.205
The Lone Ranger came to me over the radio.

01:24:46.748 --> 01:24:48.458
I didn't go to the Lone Ranger.

01:24:49.626 --> 01:24:51.586
That fucking Lone Ranger came to me.

01:24:52.754 --> 01:24:54.380
Man, he makes sense to me.

01:24:55.882 --> 01:24:57.383
He was Chinese!

01:25:00.136 --> 01:25:03.098
He wore that red shirt for good luck.

01:25:03.431 --> 01:25:07.185
He wore that mask to hide
his Chinese eyes."

01:25:10.688 --> 01:25:12.690
One thing that was significant is

01:25:13.566 --> 01:25:19.197
you could not find <i> </i> another play
by a Chinese-American writer.

01:25:20.448 --> 01:25:23.118
He's absolutely
one of those rare producers

01:25:23.201 --> 01:25:25.870
who is devoted to new writing--
You know,

01:25:25.954 --> 01:25:30.083
he's totally devoted to new writing
and the way it's connected to the actor.

01:25:31.751 --> 01:25:32.919
Wynn Handman

01:25:33.378 --> 01:25:34.712
created a space.

01:25:35.755 --> 01:25:40.260
It was like a sanctuary,
a place that you felt at home,

01:25:40.343 --> 01:25:42.637
you would go to,
and you'd roll up your sleeves,

01:25:42.720 --> 01:25:44.472
and you'd say, "Okay, let's get to work."

01:25:47.308 --> 01:25:48.268
He's a master.

01:25:49.435 --> 01:25:50.770
Master of his craft.

01:25:52.814 --> 01:25:56.234
He'll help you get your craft,
and it's up to you to make it art.

01:26:00.738 --> 01:26:04.284
-Julia Miles was...
-The managing director of the theater.

01:26:05.577 --> 01:26:09.873
Quiet, smart, a very charming person.

01:26:09.956 --> 01:26:12.959
Great at managing the money that they had

01:26:13.042 --> 01:26:17.463
and figuring out how to make the place go.

01:26:17.672 --> 01:26:20.341
<i>She was someone I related to everyday,</i>

01:26:20.425 --> 01:26:24.929
<i>and had a high regard</i>
<i>for her intelligence, her abilities,</i>

01:26:25.305 --> 01:26:31.519
<i>and her really feeling</i>
<i>what The American Place Theatre was about.</i>

01:26:32.854 --> 01:26:38.109
<i>She moved up, and then we had created</i>
<i>the title of Associate Director.</i>

01:26:40.153 --> 01:26:42.238
<i>We had the same mission.</i>

01:26:42.697 --> 01:26:45.658
<i>When plays came along</i>
<i>that I was considering,</i>

01:26:45.825 --> 01:26:49.204
<i>I had her read them,</i>
<i>and she and I would discuss them.</i>

01:26:50.371 --> 01:26:55.668
<i>It was nice to have someone that close</i>
<i>as your colleague,</i>

01:26:57.212 --> 01:27:01.341
<i>feeling the same things</i>
<i>and wanting the same things.</i>

01:27:02.842 --> 01:27:04.177
<i>She was family.</i>

01:27:07.347 --> 01:27:12.477
It's hard to realize how masculine

01:27:12.644 --> 01:27:15.104
the world of the theater was
in the early '70s.

01:27:15.980 --> 01:27:17.857
It was the culture we lived in.

01:27:18.149 --> 01:27:22.904
And so it was important
for the health of the place

01:27:23.446 --> 01:27:27.450
to have a very strong, intelligent...

01:27:28.868 --> 01:27:31.079
and fierce female presence.

01:27:37.335 --> 01:27:41.714
Well, just at this time,
and maybe a little earlier,

01:27:41.965 --> 01:27:44.550
Julia Miles was saying,

01:27:44.968 --> 01:27:48.221
"You know, we don't get enough scripts
from women."

01:27:50.223 --> 01:27:53.935
I said, "Come on, we've--
I've done women...

01:27:54.477 --> 01:27:59.148
Anne Sexton, Rochelle Owens,
María Irene Fornés."

01:28:00.066 --> 01:28:05.196
She said, "No, I'm talking about the fact
that we don't get submissions

01:28:05.863 --> 01:28:08.032
from women who are writing plays."

01:28:09.242 --> 01:28:11.494
I said, "Why not?"
She said, "They don't send them."

01:28:12.829 --> 01:28:14.414
I said, "Well, you know, Julia,

01:28:14.497 --> 01:28:19.252
I just heard about a woman
who is working for the Ford Foundation

01:28:19.836 --> 01:28:24.674
to determine if women are getting
fairly treated in the theater."

01:28:26.634 --> 01:28:31.681
A report was published that said
that some ludicrous number of plays...

01:28:31.764 --> 01:28:34.684
-Two percent. Something like that.
-...produced, two or five percent

01:28:34.767 --> 01:28:38.146
of the plays produced
in the United States, anywhere...

01:28:38.938 --> 01:28:40.189
were produced by women.

01:28:42.608 --> 01:28:45.945
Julia was shocked by this report.

01:28:47.655 --> 01:28:51.284
So I called the Ford Foundation
and when I spoke to Gail Counts,

01:28:51.868 --> 01:28:54.162
I said, "Come and meet us.

01:28:54.245 --> 01:28:59.959
Julia Miles has been talking quite a bit
about women in the theater

01:29:00.043 --> 01:29:02.045
and what she might do for it."

01:29:03.421 --> 01:29:06.632
Developing women as directors

01:29:06.716 --> 01:29:09.844
and women as dramaturgs,

01:29:09.927 --> 01:29:14.515
as other parts, functioning parts,
of doing new plays.

01:29:21.564 --> 01:29:23.149
Gail Counts came through.

01:29:26.986 --> 01:29:29.113
She found what she was looking for.

01:29:35.370 --> 01:29:39.290
She was looking for someone
who was going to do something

01:29:39.374 --> 01:29:42.919
about elevating the state
of women in the theater.

01:29:45.463 --> 01:29:49.175
And scripts came in the hundreds.

01:29:52.512 --> 01:29:54.764
I was amazed.

01:29:55.515 --> 01:29:57.558
Julia said, "You see?"

01:29:58.393 --> 01:30:00.353
I said, "Julia, you were right."

01:30:04.232 --> 01:30:07.819
I remember the first day
of the women's project very well.

01:30:07.985 --> 01:30:12.031
We all went into the rehearsal room,
and it was a day of celebration,

01:30:12.115 --> 01:30:14.492
and joy, and pride.

01:30:15.076 --> 01:30:18.621
The very first reading
of the women's project...

01:30:19.414 --> 01:30:24.168
Cay directed, and it was a one-act play
written by Sybille Pearson.

01:30:24.419 --> 01:30:27.630
And I remember we all were given a rose,

01:30:27.964 --> 01:30:29.924
even the few men who were there,

01:30:30.633 --> 01:30:33.469
to hold just as a symbol of...

01:30:34.137 --> 01:30:35.763
something beautiful, I guess.

01:30:36.305 --> 01:30:37.473
I forgot that!

01:30:37.598 --> 01:30:40.309
-Was that the first reading? Oh, my gosh!
-The very first reading

01:30:40.393 --> 01:30:41.853
of the very first year.

01:30:42.437 --> 01:30:43.896
But that day was...

01:30:44.647 --> 01:30:46.607
Speeches were made, and you know,

01:30:47.150 --> 01:30:51.362
they were glowing idealistic,
visions of utopia speeches.

01:30:51.446 --> 01:30:54.323
That's what I remember.
I remember being very moved by it.

01:31:01.747 --> 01:31:03.124
The women's project

01:31:03.541 --> 01:31:08.838
was beginning to outgrow
being some sub-project

01:31:09.046 --> 01:31:10.965
of The American Place Theatre.

01:31:11.048 --> 01:31:14.719
I think it was necessary for them

01:31:15.303 --> 01:31:18.264
to separate from the American Place,

01:31:18.347 --> 01:31:21.893
to no longer be under the umbrella
of a larger theater,

01:31:21.976 --> 01:31:25.438
and to, eventually, find their own space.

01:31:25.730 --> 01:31:27.899
They got a large grant.

01:31:28.816 --> 01:31:33.529
And it enabled the Women's Project
to now be independently

01:31:33.738 --> 01:31:35.281
the Women's Project.

01:31:35.364 --> 01:31:36.657
They bought a theater,

01:31:37.408 --> 01:31:40.119
became very much a theater of its own.

01:31:40.536 --> 01:31:42.872
Julia had her own ambitions as a producer.

01:31:43.414 --> 01:31:47.835
She was going to be able to have
more independence and voice

01:31:47.919 --> 01:31:50.922
in selecting the work
that she wanted to do,

01:31:51.005 --> 01:31:53.007
and getting it onstage
without being beholden

01:31:53.090 --> 01:31:54.383
to The American Place Theatre.

01:31:56.469 --> 01:31:57.720
Wynn's theater,

01:31:58.513 --> 01:32:01.265
structured as it was
for the common denominator

01:32:01.349 --> 01:32:03.809
of playwrights from everywhere,

01:32:04.644 --> 01:32:08.314
who didn't just come
from privileged places,

01:32:09.065 --> 01:32:11.526
meant that it was
a democratic institution,

01:32:12.235 --> 01:32:17.323
perhaps run autocratically
by producer-director, Wynn Handman.

01:32:18.616 --> 01:32:20.618
He set the rules,

01:32:21.536 --> 01:32:27.792
but he did so for a group of people
who were the disenfranchised.

01:32:29.001 --> 01:32:33.339
I was very proud of it,
pleased that it grew,

01:32:34.090 --> 01:32:36.217
and feel that it was

01:32:36.676 --> 01:32:41.889
a very worthwhile outgrowth of work
from The American Place Theatre.

01:32:43.516 --> 01:32:47.270
American theater
has had to adapt and change.

01:32:47.562 --> 01:32:50.064
We're still about inventing democracy,

01:32:50.356 --> 01:32:53.359
which is many voices,
many opposing voices,

01:32:53.568 --> 01:32:55.861
and the playwrights
represent opposing voices.

01:32:56.237 --> 01:32:58.155
Storytelling is the central point.

01:32:58.864 --> 01:33:00.866
-We need stories.

01:33:01.826 --> 01:33:03.035
We humans.

01:33:04.829 --> 01:33:07.290
- Just hold for a second--
- Sure.

01:33:07.498 --> 01:33:08.374
What did I do?

01:33:08.457 --> 01:33:10.876
-Oh, nothing. Right.
-No. He's letting this siren pass.

01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:14.088
-Just a siren we wanna let pass.
-Siren? God.

01:33:14.547 --> 01:33:17.842
-We'll ask this last question again and--
-Sirens are okay in movies, aren't they?

01:33:19.885 --> 01:33:21.262
When it's danger and emergency?

01:33:27.727 --> 01:33:29.770
- My daughters...

01:33:30.771 --> 01:33:34.191
were literally raised
in Midtown, Manhattan.

01:33:36.235 --> 01:33:39.488
I was teaching
and I had The American Place Theatre.

01:33:41.365 --> 01:33:43.451
My schedule was pretty full.

01:33:46.787 --> 01:33:48.956
Well, we always had dinner together.

01:33:51.584 --> 01:33:55.087
We had a topless bar across the street.

01:33:59.717 --> 01:34:02.720
An erotic film house around the corner.

01:34:04.347 --> 01:34:06.182
That was our neighborhood.

01:34:07.975 --> 01:34:09.977
It was still pretty...

01:34:10.561 --> 01:34:12.938
um... sexy, shall we say.

01:34:13.522 --> 01:34:17.068
It was different growing up a Handman.

01:34:18.277 --> 01:34:21.405
Very rarely did we spend time
in the studio,

01:34:21.489 --> 01:34:22.990
but there were actors here,

01:34:23.199 --> 01:34:27.411
and there were actors
who were doing things in lieu of tuition.

01:34:27.495 --> 01:34:29.872
Like James Caan was our handyman,

01:34:29.955 --> 01:34:34.001
Joanne Woodward, Sydney Pollack
were babysitters.

01:34:34.251 --> 01:34:36.671
My babysitter was Brad Davis.

01:34:39.090 --> 01:34:41.175
Dad didn't used to be a worrier.

01:34:42.426 --> 01:34:45.971
He never worried about anything,
and it was always, you know,

01:34:46.305 --> 01:34:49.975
running on the tarmac to catch the plane,
and you know...

01:34:50.101 --> 01:34:53.062
-And money, never worried about.
-Money, never ever.

01:34:53.312 --> 01:34:54.438
It was only money.

01:34:55.231 --> 01:34:59.193
And I do remember
when the new theater was being built.

01:34:59.652 --> 01:35:00.695
You were big time.

01:35:00.778 --> 01:35:03.531
It was like you had
a really established theater

01:35:03.614 --> 01:35:05.032
with a real box-office.

01:35:05.700 --> 01:35:08.494
A subscription theater
was not a common thing.

01:35:08.577 --> 01:35:11.706
It was sort of a novelty
when it was in St. Clements and earlier.

01:35:11.789 --> 01:35:15.000
But it it kind of lost steam in the '70s.

01:35:15.418 --> 01:35:19.004
Dad had to do fundraising,
which was really against his nature.

01:35:19.088 --> 01:35:20.339
I mean, he's an artist,

01:35:20.423 --> 01:35:24.593
and here he was having to ask people
for money, which he despised.

01:35:25.052 --> 01:35:27.096
So there was a lot of...

01:35:28.013 --> 01:35:31.976
you know, angst about wanting
to do great work

01:35:32.059 --> 01:35:34.019
and having the audience to see it.

01:35:34.603 --> 01:35:38.607
So I did feel that at every dinner,
pretty much.

01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:44.739
Well when you're running a theater,
a not-for-profit theater,

01:35:44.822 --> 01:35:48.367
funding is always a concern.

01:35:51.746 --> 01:35:56.000
By this time,
funding was a major consideration.

01:36:01.964 --> 01:36:05.676
I used to walk to my theater every day.

01:36:08.429 --> 01:36:10.473
And I'd say the same thing.

01:36:10.723 --> 01:36:13.058
-It was a quote from Shakespeare,

01:36:14.101 --> 01:36:15.561
<i>Richard II.</i>

01:36:17.646 --> 01:36:21.317
When things were tumbling down on him.

01:36:23.861 --> 01:36:28.908
And he says, "No deeper wrinkles yet?"

01:36:45.216 --> 01:36:48.427
<i>You're still trying</i>
<i>to figure out... who you are.</i>

01:36:50.304 --> 01:36:51.347
<i>Who are you?</i>

01:36:52.223 --> 01:36:53.724
<i>My name's Walter Hawks.</i>

01:36:55.434 --> 01:36:56.519
<i>Is that me?</i>

01:36:58.687 --> 01:37:01.398
<i>What's wonderful</i>
<i>about Wynn is that he has two lives.</i>

01:37:01.482 --> 01:37:03.984
<i>Is that me</i>
<i>standing up there? Yeah, think it is.</i>

01:37:05.611 --> 01:37:07.988
<i>Let's find out who you are</i>
<i>and how you work.</i>

01:37:09.448 --> 01:37:11.742
<i>My mother thought</i>
<i>I should be a businessman,</i>

01:37:12.117 --> 01:37:14.411
<i>but I was not cut out for it.</i>

01:37:14.829 --> 01:37:19.583
<i>There are people in life who open doors.</i>

01:37:24.338 --> 01:37:27.299
You won't believe this,
but when I got up

01:37:27.383 --> 01:37:28.801
to the Coast Guard Academy,

01:37:28.884 --> 01:37:32.304
we were in alphabetical order
in the barracks.

01:37:32.388 --> 01:37:34.390
We were "Hs" in that room.

01:37:35.599 --> 01:37:37.268
So, it was Handman...

01:37:38.811 --> 01:37:42.147
and Walter Hawks. H-A-W.

01:37:42.439 --> 01:37:43.274
But Hawks,

01:37:44.942 --> 01:37:46.151
he never showed up.

01:37:46.652 --> 01:37:49.697
But for some reason,
when they took the roll call,

01:37:50.155 --> 01:37:51.240
he'd say, "Hawks?"

01:37:51.323 --> 01:37:52.533
I'd say, "Present."

01:37:52.616 --> 01:37:55.744
And I just started to answer for Hawks.

01:37:56.912 --> 01:38:00.916
Later on, when I was now an officer
and on the ship,

01:38:01.667 --> 01:38:03.460
and we go into a port,

01:38:03.627 --> 01:38:06.463
I just would say,
"My name is Walter Hawks."

01:38:10.843 --> 01:38:13.596
I would go under the name
of Walter Hawks.

01:38:14.305 --> 01:38:15.890
I don't know why.

01:38:18.642 --> 01:38:21.604
Maybe I started to think
about character then.

01:38:25.524 --> 01:38:28.444
Everything grows from life.

01:38:29.904 --> 01:38:31.113
When we're acting...

01:38:32.907 --> 01:38:35.826
we are bringing characters to life.

01:38:40.497 --> 01:38:44.877
Most of the actors are much better
when they have a character.

01:38:47.004 --> 01:38:49.590
That's what my aim is,
to get them into it.

01:38:54.345 --> 01:38:57.848
To use a phrase I got
from Eric Bogosian...

01:38:58.849 --> 01:39:02.853
when he was doing his monologues
at my theater.

01:39:04.521 --> 01:39:08.817
One night, I dropped around,
and I saw him in a character

01:39:08.901 --> 01:39:10.319
that he had been doing.

01:39:12.029 --> 01:39:16.784
But it's like I saw the character
really for the first time.

01:39:17.701 --> 01:39:23.499
So when I went backstage,
I said, "Eric, you really have it now."

01:39:24.875 --> 01:39:25.918
He said, "Yeah,

01:39:26.460 --> 01:39:28.796
I'm really inhabiting it now."

01:39:29.755 --> 01:39:32.675
That phrase stuck with me.
I use it in my teaching.

01:39:34.426 --> 01:39:35.719
That's my aim,

01:39:36.136 --> 01:39:40.599
is to get my actors
to inhabit the character, to live in them.

01:39:42.267 --> 01:39:43.644
When it's alive,

01:39:44.687 --> 01:39:49.149
when it exists for the actor,
it exists for the audience.

01:39:52.444 --> 01:39:54.697
You're under the character's skin...

01:39:55.656 --> 01:39:57.032
to inhabit.

01:39:59.201 --> 01:40:03.455
-But I got that phrase from Eric.

01:40:04.081 --> 01:40:05.499
We're ready to roll.

01:40:06.041 --> 01:40:08.794
I'm sort of sitting forward a little bit
as you can see...

01:40:09.628 --> 01:40:11.380
I was a character actor

01:40:11.463 --> 01:40:14.341
from the time I hit the stage
when I was 16 years old.

01:40:15.134 --> 01:40:19.054
And I was into pretending
and making believe I was somebody else

01:40:19.513 --> 01:40:21.265
and doing it as forcefully as I could.

01:40:21.849 --> 01:40:24.768
As a student in the fall of 1975,

01:40:24.852 --> 01:40:28.188
-I was going to theater, I don't know,

01:40:28.564 --> 01:40:29.773
every other night.

01:40:31.316 --> 01:40:33.944
So I was looking for shows
that had things going on

01:40:34.028 --> 01:40:35.446
that were really on.

01:40:35.529 --> 01:40:37.448
But of all the shows that I saw,

01:40:37.531 --> 01:40:39.867
the one that would have
the biggest effect on me

01:40:39.950 --> 01:40:43.537
was this short piece
at The American Place Theatre.

01:40:43.704 --> 01:40:46.915
The American Place Theatre
presented Sam Shepard

01:40:47.291 --> 01:40:49.793
before most people
had heard of Sam Shepard.

01:40:50.169 --> 01:40:52.463
I had heard about Sam Shepard.

01:40:52.588 --> 01:40:54.298
Sam wrote monologues.

01:40:54.381 --> 01:40:57.551
And Sam sent me this
eight-minute monologue.

01:40:57.760 --> 01:40:59.219
Was it eight minutes? I don't know.

01:40:59.344 --> 01:41:01.013
About 30, 40 pages of monologue.

01:41:01.096 --> 01:41:03.140
Well, it was very intense.

01:41:03.223 --> 01:41:04.933
As I look back on it,

01:41:05.017 --> 01:41:10.314
he knew that I'd do anything he wanted.
And he played on that.

01:41:11.315 --> 01:41:12.900
So I say, "Okay."

01:41:12.983 --> 01:41:16.361
When I saw that there was something
going on at The American Place Theatre,

01:41:16.445 --> 01:41:18.405
I went over there to see what it was.

01:41:18.489 --> 01:41:22.826
And what it was,
was Richard Gere in <i>Killer's Head.</i>

01:41:22.910 --> 01:41:24.912
I remember seeing <i>KIller's Head </i> there,

01:41:24.995 --> 01:41:26.163
Richard Gere.

01:41:26.246 --> 01:41:28.499
I was strapped into electric chair
with a blindfold.

01:41:29.249 --> 01:41:33.504
It was so much in this character's head,
literally, it's called <i>Killer's Head.</i>

01:41:33.587 --> 01:41:34.755
It was inside of his head.

01:41:35.047 --> 01:41:37.674
You get bits and pieces.
Sometimes, it was garbled,

01:41:37.758 --> 01:41:39.093
the same as thoughts are garbled.

01:41:39.176 --> 01:41:41.303
<i>...today's the day</i>
<i>I buy the pick up.</i>

01:41:41.386 --> 01:41:43.347
<i>Should pull the horses all right.</i>

01:41:43.430 --> 01:41:45.057
<i>'Course... 60 miles round trip.</i>

01:41:45.140 --> 01:41:46.892
<i>Just to take that mare up</i>
<i>and get her bred.</i>

01:41:46.975 --> 01:41:49.937
This killer, he's going to die.
They're gonna kill him.

01:41:50.020 --> 01:41:52.314
Surely he's thinking about his crime.

01:41:52.397 --> 01:41:56.902
And all the dialogue had to do with was
whether the truck would take the horses.

01:41:56.985 --> 01:42:00.948
And all these things that had nothing
to do with crime, punishment, or anything.

01:42:01.031 --> 01:42:05.786
These were all in the killer's head,
the horses and the trucks.

01:42:05.869 --> 01:42:06.954
And going up and down

01:42:07.037 --> 01:42:08.664
-the California Highway.

01:42:08.747 --> 01:42:10.457
<i>Ain't worth it in the long run.</i>

01:42:10.541 --> 01:42:12.042
<i>Only makin' that haul once a season.</i>

01:42:12.126 --> 01:42:15.045
<i>Just to hit that fair circuit.</i>
<i>Couple a' auctions, maybe.</i>

01:42:15.129 --> 01:42:16.713
So there were a couple of things
going on.

01:42:16.797 --> 01:42:20.425
One, Gere was like practically popping out
of his seat when he was doing the role.

01:42:20.509 --> 01:42:22.845
<i>It's a full eight hours</i>
<i>no matter how ya' cut it.</i>

01:42:22.928 --> 01:42:24.555
<i>Specially with a double rig.</i>
<i>Full days ride</i>

01:42:24.638 --> 01:42:27.224
But more importantly,
it was a monologue.

01:42:27.307 --> 01:42:29.685
A lot of Sam's work is just monologues.

01:42:29.768 --> 01:42:31.645
-Yeah.
- It wasn't just a monologue,

01:42:31.728 --> 01:42:34.773
it was a monologue that had this...

01:42:34.982 --> 01:42:37.526
kind of dream-like quality to it.

01:42:37.609 --> 01:42:39.069
And it just made perfect sense to me.

01:42:39.153 --> 01:42:41.238
And the energy was through the roof.

01:42:43.907 --> 01:42:46.368
And then finally
there's this blinding flash of light,

01:42:46.743 --> 01:42:48.287
-and he's electrocuted.

01:42:48.829 --> 01:42:49.788
The play is over.

01:42:50.164 --> 01:42:51.999
It was astonishing.

01:42:52.124 --> 01:42:55.586
What I didn't know
was what a huge effect

01:42:55.669 --> 01:42:57.921
<i>Killer's Head </i> would have on my work.

01:42:58.005 --> 01:43:00.007
And I didn't know about Wynn Handman
at that point.

01:43:00.090 --> 01:43:02.259
I just had gone to a theater,
and there was this piece.

01:43:02.342 --> 01:43:03.177
But actually...

01:43:05.179 --> 01:43:06.430
Am I running on here?

01:43:06.513 --> 01:43:09.850
Wynn would have an effect
on me before I met Wynn,

01:43:10.058 --> 01:43:13.270
because he produced <i>Regard of Flight</i>

01:43:13.770 --> 01:43:15.397
with Bill Irwin in 1982.

01:43:15.480 --> 01:43:16.899
<i>The Regard of Flight.</i>

01:43:16.982 --> 01:43:20.068
-I think the phrase came to me in a dream.

01:43:23.739 --> 01:43:25.490
This makes me think of a misspent youth.

01:43:27.951 --> 01:43:29.661
I thought of The American Place as...

01:43:30.370 --> 01:43:32.080
"Oh, that'd be a good place to do a show."

01:43:33.665 --> 01:43:37.419
In 1981,
Wynn was still in after excitement

01:43:37.544 --> 01:43:39.254
over this production they'd done

01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:41.673
of <i>Der Fuehrer Bunker.</i>

01:43:42.424 --> 01:43:44.384
If he gets excited about Hitler,

01:43:44.468 --> 01:43:47.304
maybe he'll have a place in his heart
for clowns.

01:43:47.429 --> 01:43:49.264
<i>Now, is this new theater?</i>

01:43:49.806 --> 01:43:51.016
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:43:51.350 --> 01:43:54.144
<i>Well, what we're seeing here this evening</i>
<i>is new theater. Is that right?</i>

01:43:54.353 --> 01:43:55.812
<i>Ah, yes, it is, it's new.</i>

01:43:55.938 --> 01:43:58.607
We were trying without entirely knowing
what we were doing.

01:43:58.690 --> 01:44:02.903
We were trying to create a piece
that both was a piece of new theater.

01:44:03.195 --> 01:44:06.698
And there's this non-linear
capturing a dream-like feeling.

01:44:06.782 --> 01:44:09.409
But at the same time was kind of...

01:44:09.493 --> 01:44:10.494
A chase.

01:44:11.161 --> 01:44:13.121
Taking flight from a critic.

01:44:19.253 --> 01:44:21.755
So there were
a couple of things going on here. One,

01:44:22.589 --> 01:44:25.634
Bill really broke out with that show.

01:44:26.134 --> 01:44:27.886
But even more importantly,

01:44:28.345 --> 01:44:32.766
Bill was working in solo
but saying, "This is a piece.

01:44:32.849 --> 01:44:34.559
It all fits together."

01:44:35.227 --> 01:44:37.354
It definitely made me think
something about...

01:44:38.563 --> 01:44:41.024
I don't know, solos can go somewhere.

01:44:43.026 --> 01:44:45.529
-...and I loved being in his office.

01:44:45.612 --> 01:44:48.490
It was very funny 'cause he's showing me
all of these pictures, you know,

01:44:48.573 --> 01:44:51.785
"You can keep this, you read this
when you get a chance," you know.

01:44:54.830 --> 01:44:57.124
It was interesting being there.
It was great being there.

01:44:57.541 --> 01:44:59.293
Taking the work to the next level.

01:45:01.962 --> 01:45:06.049
I didn't want to be known
as a downtown performance artist.

01:45:06.133 --> 01:45:07.718
I just wanted to be a theater person.

01:45:14.808 --> 01:45:16.393
People like Wynn...

01:45:17.477 --> 01:45:21.148
helped give me the courage to look
at the beautiful stuff and the ugly stuff,

01:45:21.773 --> 01:45:23.150
and invent and reinvent.

01:45:25.652 --> 01:45:28.989
Because I'm really interested
in dark, dark work, that's the thing.

01:45:29.614 --> 01:45:32.117
And so he was one of the few
that didn't shy away from it.

01:45:33.201 --> 01:45:34.369
First, <i>Beauty's Daughter.</i>

01:45:37.122 --> 01:45:39.791
It went from character to character
interspersed with poems,

01:45:39.875 --> 01:45:41.084
but it's still theater.

01:45:41.168 --> 01:45:45.505
It's a play. It's a play for one person
doing different roles.

01:45:45.797 --> 01:45:48.675
He wasn't even thinking about it in terms
of it being a one-person play.

01:45:48.759 --> 01:45:50.344
He was just thinking theater.

01:45:51.887 --> 01:45:54.348
I had hit a point of stasis
in my career,

01:45:54.431 --> 01:45:55.766
but I was working on a show.

01:45:56.975 --> 01:46:00.896
Now, the name of the production
was <i>Drinking in America.</i>

01:46:01.772 --> 01:46:06.109
Now, <i>Drinking in America...</i>
Each character, there are about 12...

01:46:06.193 --> 01:46:08.779
So in the fall of '85,

01:46:09.112 --> 01:46:10.155
I went and saw Wynn.

01:46:12.199 --> 01:46:14.493
What's interesting with Eric is that...

01:46:15.285 --> 01:46:17.245
he started doing these monologues

01:46:18.080 --> 01:46:22.209
because he saw a Sam Shepard monologue
called <i>Killer's Head,</i>

01:46:22.459 --> 01:46:24.503
which was done by Richard Gere.

01:46:24.711 --> 01:46:26.004
Maybe he just thought,

01:46:26.630 --> 01:46:27.589
"I don't know...

01:46:28.673 --> 01:46:30.258
I can do something with this kid."

01:46:30.342 --> 01:46:31.635
And Wynn said...

01:46:31.718 --> 01:46:33.261
I said, "Well, let's work on it."

01:46:33.345 --> 01:46:36.223
"I can take you further
with this character work."

01:46:36.306 --> 01:46:38.433
Ballast yourself with reality.

01:46:39.101 --> 01:46:44.064
Actors must find ballast
to go about what they're doing.

01:46:44.856 --> 01:46:49.236
And they need something
to lock onto to be better.

01:46:51.488 --> 01:46:56.701
Wynn loves the process
of character creation.

01:46:57.119 --> 01:47:04.042
What I teach is it's coming out
of what's existing inside of you.

01:47:04.835 --> 01:47:07.671
As you discover,
as you really live it.

01:47:08.755 --> 01:47:14.302
And if it exists for you,
it will exist for the audience.

01:47:16.263 --> 01:47:19.766
And he helped me understand
how to dig deeper

01:47:19.850 --> 01:47:24.479
and ground those characters.
And that showed up in <i>Drinking in America.</i>

01:47:25.730 --> 01:47:30.277
So that's what happened with me and Wynn.
That's how I ended up at American Place,

01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:35.157
in 1986, when we did <i>Drinking in America</i>
at The American Place Theatre.

01:47:36.741 --> 01:47:39.995
Truckin' with the do-dah man.

01:47:40.162 --> 01:47:44.708
Grateful Dead music playing on the stereo.
We're blowing these J's, man.

01:47:44.791 --> 01:47:48.545
We're getting completely
like fucked out of our minds, right?

01:47:50.297 --> 01:47:53.425
And then the 'ludes kick in, right?

01:47:53.550 --> 01:47:56.428
Hey man,
take your hand off my girlfriend's leg.

01:47:56.845 --> 01:47:59.681
Fuck you! No man, fuck you!

01:47:59.848 --> 01:48:02.100
No man, fuck you!

01:48:09.858 --> 01:48:12.861
I was into all this intense physicality
on stage.

01:48:12.944 --> 01:48:14.571
Hitting and flailing.

01:48:14.654 --> 01:48:17.782
I actually can't do it right now
or the mic will get torn off of me.

01:48:17.866 --> 01:48:19.493
I don't know what I could've been doing,

01:48:19.576 --> 01:48:22.329
but I was throwing myself
forward or something.

01:48:22.412 --> 01:48:25.373
But I didn't realize I had hurt myself.
Anyway, I look down,

01:48:25.457 --> 01:48:28.627
and there's these red spots
all over the place.

01:48:28.710 --> 01:48:32.005
That looks like blood. Am I bleeding?
So I ran off to the wings

01:48:32.088 --> 01:48:34.174
where Rebecca Green our stage manager was.

01:48:34.257 --> 01:48:36.468
She says, "You're bleeding.
You're really bleeding a lot.

01:48:36.801 --> 01:48:40.055
We have to do something right now."
And she called Wynn and he came down.

01:48:40.263 --> 01:48:43.975
And he just whisked me out the door
to Roosevelt Hospital.

01:48:44.059 --> 01:48:45.310
I took eight stitches.

01:48:45.393 --> 01:48:49.105
Wynn is really worried about me
and as I'm being stitched up I said,

01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:50.023
"Wynn...

01:48:50.899 --> 01:48:53.485
have we told the audience
that I'm not coming back?"

01:48:57.864 --> 01:49:01.159
- I came to New York in '91.

01:49:01.660 --> 01:49:03.161
And... um...

01:49:03.537 --> 01:49:05.789
I had heard of this...

01:49:06.248 --> 01:49:08.083
So I started working.

01:49:08.250 --> 01:49:09.668
Okay, wait, hold on, back up.

01:49:09.751 --> 01:49:12.879
-I was walking down 46th Street,

01:49:12.963 --> 01:49:15.340
-two weeks after I got to New York City.

01:49:15.423 --> 01:49:18.510
And I see these two giants,

01:49:18.593 --> 01:49:21.596
Sam Shepard and John Malkovich
come out of this theater.

01:49:21.680 --> 01:49:23.056
The American Place Theatre.

01:49:23.139 --> 01:49:25.267
And I remember that feeling of like,

01:49:25.350 --> 01:49:30.855
"This must be where
really great actors work."

01:49:30.939 --> 01:49:32.983
Cut to a few months later.

01:49:33.441 --> 01:49:37.571
I started working for this woman
who would sell cookies and brownies

01:49:37.654 --> 01:49:40.490
during intermission at this theater

01:49:40.574 --> 01:49:44.536
that I had seen John Malkovich
and Sam Shepard come out of.

01:49:44.619 --> 01:49:47.998
Cut to this guy walks into the lobby
of the theater.

01:49:48.081 --> 01:49:51.751
Crotchety, distempered,
irritated with everything.

01:49:51.835 --> 01:49:54.462
And I thought,
"Who's that old cranky guy?"

01:49:54.546 --> 01:49:57.382
She said, "Oh, that's the guy
that runs this theater.

01:49:57.465 --> 01:49:58.592
-That's Wynn Handman."

01:49:58.675 --> 01:50:00.468
She said, "He has an acting class."

01:50:00.552 --> 01:50:03.138
"Oh, my God, it'd be so amazing
to be in his acting class."

01:50:03.221 --> 01:50:05.890
"No, don't even bother.
It's very high caliber.

01:50:05.974 --> 01:50:07.809
It's really for very professional actors."

01:50:07.892 --> 01:50:11.688
Cut to the girl I was dating at the time.
She goes, "Guess what?

01:50:11.771 --> 01:50:14.858
I'm auditioning for this acting teacher,

01:50:14.941 --> 01:50:17.360
who's supposed to be
one of the greatest acting teachers

01:50:17.444 --> 01:50:18.320
in New York City."

01:50:18.403 --> 01:50:20.864
And I was like,
"Oh my God! Wait, that's Wynn Handman.

01:50:20.989 --> 01:50:22.532
I was told you can't get in his class."

01:50:22.616 --> 01:50:24.451
She said, "Well, I'm auditioning for it."

01:50:24.534 --> 01:50:26.703
-So I said, "I'm gonna audition for it."

01:50:29.080 --> 01:50:32.334
You know, obviously he came from Meisner
and all of that.

01:50:33.585 --> 01:50:37.339
A lot of his technique
had to do with finding character,

01:50:37.422 --> 01:50:40.717
building character.
So that you could play that character

01:50:41.134 --> 01:50:43.261
in any scene, in that play.

01:50:43.720 --> 01:50:46.598
And you could even play that character
outside of that play.

01:50:46.681 --> 01:50:48.850
He would do something
called the character interview,

01:50:49.309 --> 01:50:51.603
where he would talk to you in character

01:50:51.811 --> 01:50:54.105
and he would interview you
and you would speak to him...

01:50:55.106 --> 01:50:56.483
Kind of what I'm doing right now.

01:50:57.984 --> 01:51:00.487
You were finding it within yourself,

01:51:00.987 --> 01:51:04.407
you know, in a way you were finding
where the character lived in you,

01:51:04.491 --> 01:51:06.576
you know, and there was no wrong way
to do it,

01:51:07.535 --> 01:51:08.828
except if you didn't believe it.

01:51:11.373 --> 01:51:14.042
The first thing you have to be
is truthful.

01:51:14.125 --> 01:51:17.212
Because he could just tell
when you weren't.

01:51:18.254 --> 01:51:22.425
Wynn, above and beyond everything,
wanted us to tell the truth

01:51:22.509 --> 01:51:24.094
in the work that we were doing.

01:51:24.386 --> 01:51:27.305
Part of that truth
came from knowing ourselves

01:51:27.430 --> 01:51:29.182
and knowing what we had to offer

01:51:29.891 --> 01:51:31.810
to the character that we were playing.

01:51:33.186 --> 01:51:35.480
It had to be truthful,
it had to be honest,

01:51:35.563 --> 01:51:38.817
and it had to come
from what your truth was.

01:51:42.028 --> 01:51:45.740
Having the vulnerability enough to...

01:51:47.283 --> 01:51:50.495
just be simple and and truthful.

01:51:52.122 --> 01:51:54.791
That was such a big deal at the time.

01:51:59.629 --> 01:52:02.757
Because I now knew about,
like, Bogosian and, like, Leguizamo,

01:52:02.841 --> 01:52:05.385
and all these people that had studied
with him, and I said,

01:52:05.593 --> 01:52:09.013
"You know, I also have a solo show

01:52:09.097 --> 01:52:11.015
that I'm working on
and I know that you were..."

01:52:11.099 --> 01:52:13.768
I think, probably at one time or another,
every single person in class

01:52:13.852 --> 01:52:15.311
was working on their one-person show.

01:52:16.438 --> 01:52:20.066
That John Leguizamo had success there
was like a legendary...

01:52:20.150 --> 01:52:22.318
You felt like,
"That could be me."

01:52:23.319 --> 01:52:28.366
I wasn't interested in working
with other actors or doing scene study.

01:52:28.533 --> 01:52:31.619
I wanted to create a one-man show.

01:52:33.246 --> 01:52:37.959
And, somehow, I believed that Wynn
was going to be sort of the catalyst

01:52:38.042 --> 01:52:41.671
and the person who could help me
make that happen.

01:52:43.339 --> 01:52:47.218
And in Wynn's class,
I was able to put it together as a show,

01:52:47.302 --> 01:52:48.178
like a whole.

01:52:49.471 --> 01:52:51.556
He really believed in me and I felt that,

01:52:52.140 --> 01:52:53.892
and that was the impetus
that kept me going

01:52:53.975 --> 01:52:56.352
till it became a solidified show,
you know?

01:53:00.982 --> 01:53:05.028
People, Aasif Mandvi in particular,
would bring these characters in

01:53:05.403 --> 01:53:07.405
and he'd work on them.

01:53:07.489 --> 01:53:08.406
You know, at the time--

01:53:08.490 --> 01:53:11.868
You have to remember
there was no monologue

01:53:11.951 --> 01:53:15.872
that I could do in class or anywhere,
in audition or anything,

01:53:16.372 --> 01:53:19.626
that was actually a person of my heritage.

01:53:19.709 --> 01:53:22.587
Here I am, with no real monologue

01:53:22.670 --> 01:53:25.381
that spoke about anything
of my experience,

01:53:25.465 --> 01:53:27.091
of my American experience.

01:53:27.175 --> 01:53:28.802
There was nothing, so I wrote this play.

01:53:30.720 --> 01:53:33.640
One of the first real triumphs

01:53:33.723 --> 01:53:36.643
I felt of any of my classmates
was Aasif Mandvi

01:53:36.726 --> 01:53:38.937
got to do his one-man show
at the American Place.

01:53:39.020 --> 01:53:41.523
- Nobody wanted to do my play.

01:53:42.106 --> 01:53:44.484
He was the one that took a chance
on this show.

01:53:45.944 --> 01:53:47.445
And he believed in me.

01:53:47.529 --> 01:53:50.073
And I think that was the biggest thing.
He believed in me.

01:53:52.075 --> 01:53:54.327
I was aware
that the American Place Theatre

01:53:54.410 --> 01:53:56.162
hadn't had a hit in a long time.

01:53:56.329 --> 01:53:57.163
And so...

01:53:58.331 --> 01:53:59.457
I was excited that...

01:54:00.041 --> 01:54:03.753
Wynn had a hit show on his hands,
you know?

01:54:05.421 --> 01:54:07.799
I also knew that the money wasn't there.

01:54:10.385 --> 01:54:12.971
My mother thought
I should be a businessman

01:54:13.054 --> 01:54:15.473
but I was not cut out for it.

01:54:18.017 --> 01:54:20.144
I stayed away from all that stuff.

01:54:20.520 --> 01:54:25.984
I can understand why, you know,
Wynn would not be really into...

01:54:26.943 --> 01:54:28.611
going to fundraisers

01:54:28.695 --> 01:54:30.488
and would rather be hanging
around the theater,

01:54:30.572 --> 01:54:33.241
and watching the creative process unfold.

01:54:33.324 --> 01:54:37.078
That's the excitement
about making live theater.

01:54:38.413 --> 01:54:40.874
He fully lives that.

01:54:41.499 --> 01:54:43.626
He puts everything on the line for it.

01:54:44.127 --> 01:54:45.503
And not too many people do that.

01:54:45.587 --> 01:54:47.797
They talk it. They'll, you know, but...

01:54:48.840 --> 01:54:52.343
he's fully about theater.
Everything is about art for him.

01:54:53.678 --> 01:54:56.139
That kind of excitement
about the art

01:54:56.222 --> 01:54:57.932
and wanting to be part of the art

01:54:58.016 --> 01:55:00.560
is very different
than the kind of person

01:55:00.643 --> 01:55:04.105
who's organizationally acute,

01:55:04.439 --> 01:55:06.649
wants to be going to benefit dinners
all the time,

01:55:06.733 --> 01:55:09.944
wants to be meeting with rich people
and asking them for money.

01:55:10.028 --> 01:55:13.406
And, sometimes, these two things
don't fit together at all.

01:55:14.866 --> 01:55:19.245
I wouldn't call Wynn Handman a lunatic.
I would call Wynn Handman a true believer.

01:55:20.788 --> 01:55:25.919
And that belief, I know, has poured
into his students over the years,

01:55:26.002 --> 01:55:27.503
because I've met a lot of his students,

01:55:27.587 --> 01:55:30.882
and they really believe in the theater
that he believes in.

01:55:32.008 --> 01:55:35.720
Life changing, significant theater.

01:55:37.263 --> 01:55:39.974
Everything changed
at the American Place for me.

01:55:41.559 --> 01:55:44.812
So...
I wouldn't call him a lunatic.

01:55:47.148 --> 01:55:49.901
More like a, yeah, a true believer.

01:56:02.163 --> 01:56:04.958
When a theater closes,
a civilization shuts down.

01:56:05.792 --> 01:56:08.795
Vanished are all the characters
who appeared on stage.

01:56:09.545 --> 01:56:11.297
The audience, too, is gone.

01:56:11.839 --> 01:56:14.050
A few months ago,
The American Place Theatre

01:56:14.133 --> 01:56:15.885
had to leave its longtime location.

01:56:16.177 --> 01:56:19.597
A civilization existed and flourished
on West 46th Street.

01:56:20.390 --> 01:56:22.392
It had a rich and various population,

01:56:22.767 --> 01:56:25.103
and a million scenes,
which are now memories.

01:56:25.853 --> 01:56:27.814
So we bow our heads.

01:56:28.356 --> 01:56:31.150
They say that life is short
and art is long.

01:56:32.944 --> 01:56:34.320
Sometimes, not long enough.

01:56:36.656 --> 01:56:41.285
And we have a program,
which is called Literature to Life,

01:56:41.786 --> 01:56:46.624
where we design the plays
for young students like yourself.

01:57:04.767 --> 01:57:08.312
Well, I enjoyed every moment
of it because...

01:57:09.105 --> 01:57:12.066
I mean, if I have a calling,
this is what it is.

01:57:12.483 --> 01:57:15.445
Calling became a meaningful word to me.

01:57:16.320 --> 01:57:18.239
It's lucky that there are...

01:57:19.032 --> 01:57:22.452
talented people around like you all to...

01:57:23.536 --> 01:57:25.121
work with me, and I work with you.

01:57:25.496 --> 01:57:26.456
Thank you.

01:57:34.839 --> 01:57:38.885
"We only die
if we don't live on in others."

01:57:41.554 --> 01:57:44.932
I got that quote from Leon Trotsky,

01:57:46.225 --> 01:57:47.852
famous communist.

01:57:51.647 --> 01:57:55.276
"We only die
if we don't live on in others."

01:58:05.995 --> 01:58:06.913
All right.

01:58:12.710 --> 01:58:15.421
- <i>I think he got what he wanted...</i>

01:58:16.130 --> 01:58:18.299
<i>and is getting what he wants today.</i>

01:58:22.678 --> 01:58:24.180
<i>-</i> <i>He never...</i>
<i>-</i>

01:58:25.181 --> 01:58:26.933
<i>betrayed himself.</i>

01:58:27.934 --> 01:58:30.019
<i>He did it his way,</i>

01:58:30.436 --> 01:58:31.771
<i>and it was unique.</i>

01:58:33.481 --> 01:58:35.858
<i>You start something</i>
<i>when you're a young man.</i>

01:58:37.944 --> 01:58:40.363
<i>You know, year after year, you get older,</i>

01:58:41.155 --> 01:58:42.949
<i>and things change within you.</i>

01:58:44.283 --> 01:58:45.493
<i>Nothing lasts forever.</i>

01:58:45.785 --> 01:58:48.037
<i>I mean, we're talking about decades.</i>

01:58:49.789 --> 01:58:55.086
<i>You know, Wynn's legacy is strong</i>
<i>without necessarily being strongly named.</i>

01:58:55.169 --> 01:58:57.505
<i>His accomplishment is permanent.</i>

01:58:58.381 --> 01:58:59.924
<i>I'm not sure there's going to be</i>

01:59:00.007 --> 01:59:01.884
<i>the Wynn Handman this</i>
<i>or the Wynn Handman that,</i>

01:59:01.968 --> 01:59:03.803
<i>except in people's minds and hearts.</i>

01:59:05.471 --> 01:59:07.265
<i>-</i> <i>He's one of the greats.</i>

01:59:07.348 --> 01:59:11.185
<i>It's like this Mount Rushmore of theater</i>
<i>and he's one of the carved heads.</i>

01:59:11.269 --> 01:59:13.187
<i>I think that pleased him</i>
<i>a great deal.</i>

01:59:13.646 --> 01:59:15.606
<i>To afford people the right</i>

01:59:15.731 --> 01:59:17.483
<i>-to be seen and heard.</i>

01:59:18.067 --> 01:59:21.237
<i>Wynn was really creating a place</i>
<i>for artists, you know, a home.</i>

01:59:22.280 --> 01:59:27.243
<i>For artists of any color, any religion.</i>
<i> It was just a home for artists.</i>

01:59:27.326 --> 01:59:30.788
<i>The young writers and young actors,</i>
<i>and it wasn't about money.</i>

01:59:30.872 --> 01:59:32.874
<i>It was about giving everybody a chance.</i>

01:59:32.957 --> 01:59:36.919
<i>I think he gave them</i>
<i>a trust of their own instincts.</i>

01:59:37.461 --> 01:59:40.047
<i>I think that he gave them</i>
<i>an attitude towards the world.</i>

01:59:40.506 --> 01:59:41.841
<i>The notion that theater</i>

01:59:41.924 --> 01:59:45.887
<i>is part of an ethos</i>
<i>of how you approach the world.</i>

01:59:46.012 --> 01:59:50.057
<i>He gave me a kind of confidence</i>
<i>to trust my own feelings.</i>

01:59:50.808 --> 01:59:53.227
<i>And when you're an artist,</i>
<i>there's nothing greater than that.</i>

01:59:53.311 --> 01:59:56.772
<i>What he cared about was storytelling</i>

01:59:56.856 --> 02:00:01.903
<i>that made you,</i>
<i>and then hopefully the world, better.</i>

02:00:02.445 --> 02:00:06.616
<i>Showed you something you hadn't seen</i>
<i>with kindness, with openness.</i>

02:00:08.993 --> 02:00:11.204
<i>That's one of the best things</i>
<i>theater can do,</i>

02:00:11.287 --> 02:00:13.206
<i>-</i>
<i>-and that was his dedication.</i>

02:00:14.248 --> 02:00:17.126
<i>Where does one find a more gentle man?</i>

02:00:18.085 --> 02:00:21.380
-<i>Wynn is a profoundly committed teacher.</i>

02:00:22.215 --> 02:00:27.220
<i>He is, without question,</i>
<i>the most important teacher of my life.</i>

02:00:27.303 --> 02:00:31.766
<i>He really loves his students</i>
<i>and the gift they have to give.</i>

02:00:31.849 --> 02:00:33.726
<i>It felt like he was giving us a gift.</i>

02:00:34.560 --> 02:00:35.561
<i>It's not about him.</i>

02:00:36.187 --> 02:00:39.899
<i>It's what he's able</i>
<i>to bring out in others.</i>

02:00:40.441 --> 02:00:41.859
<i>He ran his class that way.</i>

02:00:42.109 --> 02:00:43.778
<i>He ran his theater that way.</i>

02:00:43.861 --> 02:00:49.242
<i>I carry with me really as tools,</i>
<i>every day, in my work</i>

02:00:49.533 --> 02:00:51.410
<i>so much of what I learned from him.</i>

02:00:51.494 --> 02:00:53.412
<i>I was really lucky...</i>

02:00:55.039 --> 02:00:56.123
<i>to find him.</i>

02:00:56.874 --> 02:00:59.794
<i>To say that it was lucky</i>
<i>is not sufficient.</i>

02:01:01.128 --> 02:01:04.966
<i>He is a part of who I am</i>
<i>and what I do everyday.</i>

02:01:06.008 --> 02:01:09.512
<i>The fact that I was able to do</i>
<i>whatever I was able to do in the theater</i>

02:01:09.595 --> 02:01:11.430
<i>is down to Wynn.</i>

02:01:11.514 --> 02:01:12.682
<i>He's been such</i>

02:01:13.099 --> 02:01:15.601
<i>a rock and such a mentor.</i>

02:01:15.851 --> 02:01:18.437
<i>I can't even sum up the emotions</i>

02:01:18.521 --> 02:01:20.856
<i>of what it meant to be believed in,</i>

02:01:21.524 --> 02:01:25.278
<i>when you quite weren't sure</i>
<i>if you could believe in yourself.</i>

02:01:25.361 --> 02:01:27.697
<i>It was a lifeline for me.</i>

02:01:28.281 --> 02:01:29.365
<i>I was searching.</i>

02:01:29.991 --> 02:01:33.035
<i>I could see no possibilities.</i>

02:01:34.745 --> 02:01:38.040
<i>The American theater was beyond my reach.</i>

02:01:39.125 --> 02:01:40.751
<i>Wynn Handman brought it closer.</i>

02:01:41.252 --> 02:01:43.212
<i>I never thought he was crazy.</i>

02:01:43.296 --> 02:01:46.716
<i>I always thought</i>
<i>that what he wanted to do was great.</i>

02:01:49.510 --> 02:01:51.387
<i>You could have a theater</i>
<i>the way you wanted it,</i>

02:01:51.470 --> 02:01:54.473
<i>if you could have the playwrights</i>
<i>and the actors that you wanted.</i>

02:01:54.557 --> 02:01:56.475
<i>And he gave them a stage.</i>

02:01:57.518 --> 02:01:59.228
<i>He gave them a place.</i>

02:01:59.312 --> 02:02:03.983
<i>Creating a place</i>
<i>where real theater pieces are developed,</i>

02:02:04.066 --> 02:02:07.862
<i>that can help us to see life</i>
<i>a little differently than we do.</i>

02:02:07.945 --> 02:02:10.072
<i>You could approach it</i>
<i>from that point of view,</i>

02:02:10.156 --> 02:02:12.491
<i>not from, "Is this going to succeed?</i>
<i>Is it going to fail?"</i>

02:02:12.742 --> 02:02:13.576
<i>A model.</i>

02:02:14.952 --> 02:02:17.663
<i>-</i>
<i>-A model for the future.</i>

02:02:19.957 --> 02:02:21.709
<i>Because such places are needed.</i>

02:02:22.001 --> 02:02:24.253
<i>This was a good thing</i>
<i>to do with your life.</i>

02:02:24.754 --> 02:02:28.049
You popped up in a dream of mine
last week, actually.

02:02:28.132 --> 02:02:30.843
And you were like, "Come back to class."

02:02:30.926 --> 02:02:33.012
It might be-- It might be almost time,

02:02:33.095 --> 02:02:36.724
but it's so good to see you
and to see you in such good spirits.

02:02:37.224 --> 02:02:39.477
- I am in good spirits.
- You are.

02:02:40.144 --> 02:02:41.896
I won't keep you.
I'll let everyone see you...

02:02:42.021 --> 02:02:44.148
- Well, you're looking good.
- Thank you.

02:02:44.815 --> 02:02:47.360
- And I'm glad you're employed.
- Thank you.

02:02:47.443 --> 02:02:48.277
Okay, good.
