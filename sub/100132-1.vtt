was arne johnson.

Arne johnson was challenging
this demon to get out of david

01:17.640 --> 01:20.610
and to possess him --
it ended up doing that,

01:20.640 --> 01:23.880
and arne johnson went on
to commit a murder.

something affected him.

1:26:10.490 --> 1:26:12.530
Yes.
Like, we had one experience,
now we can say

1:26:12.560 --> 1:26:13.860
100 percent.
We have a comparison.

1:26:13.900 --> 1:26:15.760
And honestly, I didn't feel
anything when I first sat in it.

1:26:15.800 --> 1:26:18.670
I'm feelin' something already,
man, just...

1:26:18.740 --> 1:26:24.140
[ sighs ]
zak: Commit, commit.

1:26:24.180 --> 1:26:25.540
[ exhales ]

1:26:25.610 --> 1:26:27.610
give it a moment.

1:26:27.680 --> 1:26:31.480
This isn't a normal chair.

1:26:31.520 --> 1:26:35.280
I don't want to get up.
I honestly don't.

1:26:35.350 --> 1:26:37.590
It's...

1:26:37.620 --> 1:26:39.420
Zak: What is it?
Just a feeling of relaxation?

1:26:39.490 --> 1:26:41.690
Yeah, I mean, I feel good,
I feel energized.

1:26:41.730 --> 1:26:43.630
I feel something
rushing through me.

1:26:43.660 --> 1:26:46.600
So without having
the psychosomatic of --

1:26:46.660 --> 1:26:48.830
of you being in
the devil's rocking chair,

1:26:48.870 --> 1:26:52.570
are you feeling different
sitting in the chair

1:26:52.640 --> 1:26:54.670
than you were operating
the camera?
100 percent.

1:26:54.740 --> 1:26:57.670
But it's not --
I don't feel scared,

1:26:57.740 --> 1:26:59.840
I don't feel evil --
it feels an energy rush

1:26:59.910 --> 1:27:02.810
through me, and it honestly
feels really good.
Okay, let's --

1:27:02.850 --> 1:27:05.910
let's try this --
I want you to sit up, okay.

1:27:05.950 --> 1:27:09.750
Stand, and I want to see
if the chair does anything,

1:27:09.790 --> 1:27:14.660
reacts -- if there is a --
a demon that --

1:27:14.690 --> 1:27:17.660
you are called the "beast,"
you possessed the --

1:27:17.700 --> 1:27:21.530
the boy of david glatzel,
I want you to

1:27:21.600 --> 1:27:24.570
levitate this chair
as you did

1:27:24.640 --> 1:27:28.500
during those possessions.

1:27:28.570 --> 1:27:30.710
Will you do that?

1:27:30.740 --> 1:27:33.880
Rock the chair --
get up, let it settle,

1:27:33.910 --> 1:27:36.580
and see if the chair
moves or anything like that.

1:27:36.610 --> 1:27:40.020
Let it go --
come back over here, jay.

1:27:40.050 --> 1:27:43.290
Aaron: You want me
to shoot the chair?
Yes, stay on the chair.

1:27:46.860 --> 1:27:49.960
Jay: Whatever I felt,
can you move the chair?

1:27:54.400 --> 1:27:56.670
Zak: Can you move the chair?

1:27:56.700 --> 1:28:01.740
Show us that you do have
control over this chair

1:28:01.770 --> 1:28:04.470
and that you are still attached
to the artifacts

1:28:04.510 --> 1:28:06.540
in this room.

1:28:06.610 --> 1:28:08.410
I still feel it.

1:28:08.480 --> 1:28:11.310
I feel okay --
what do you feel?

1:28:11.350 --> 1:28:13.420
I feel --
it's weird, like...

1:28:13.480 --> 1:28:16.550
You good?
No, I don't know.

1:28:16.590 --> 1:28:20.560
Like, I don't feel scared,
I'm not angry,

1:28:20.590 --> 1:28:23.890
I'm not aggressive --
I feel<i> really</i> good,

1:28:23.930 --> 1:28:27.630
but it's, like, overwhelming,
like a jittery feeling.
Yeah.

1:28:27.700 --> 1:28:29.530
So you do feel as though...

1:28:29.600 --> 1:28:31.630
There is energy to that chair

1:28:31.700 --> 1:28:34.600
that I'm still feeling,
and I'm not even sitting

1:28:34.640 --> 1:28:38.010
in it now.
Can you make this chair move?

1:28:41.210 --> 1:28:43.410
Show us that you're here,
that you're still attached

1:28:43.480 --> 1:28:47.550
to this chair --
okay, so there you have it.

1:28:47.620 --> 1:28:51.450
We, uh -- jay and I just sat
in the devil's rocking chair,

1:28:51.490 --> 1:28:55.520
um, I know what I felt --
I didn't feel affected,

1:28:55.590 --> 1:28:57.830
but I did feel a couple
physical things.

1:28:57.900 --> 1:28:59.860
I did have a little episode
of back pain,

1:28:59.900 --> 1:29:02.500
but not when I was in the chair,
when I was behind it,

1:29:02.530 --> 1:29:05.670
and then I felt something
taze me in the back,
right.

1:29:05.700 --> 1:29:07.740
Which caused me to pop up
and actually laugh.

1:29:07.810 --> 1:29:10.570
I don't feel any negativity,
I don't have any back pain.

1:29:10.610 --> 1:29:14.010
You had more of
a psychological experience.

1:29:14.040 --> 1:29:15.740
You could feel it physically,
too, through your body.

1:29:15.780 --> 1:29:17.780
It was like --
almost like pins and needles

1:29:17.820 --> 1:29:19.650
but just rushing
through your body.

1:29:19.720 --> 1:29:23.790
So stay tuned -- jay and I
will be on our twitter,

1:29:23.820 --> 1:29:27.490
and we will give you updates
if there are any

1:29:27.520 --> 1:29:31.630
concerning what we just did,
and if you start seein' us

1:29:31.700 --> 1:29:34.730
walkin' around in canes,
uh,

1:29:34.770 --> 1:29:38.270
you know that, uh,
something really went

1:29:38.300 --> 1:29:39.770
down here, uh,
in a bad way.

1:29:39.800 --> 1:29:42.570
So thank you all so much
for tuning in

1:29:42.640 --> 1:29:44.740
to the two-hour Halloween
special of

1:29:44.810 --> 1:29:46.810
the "curse of the harrisville
farmhouse,"

1:29:46.880 --> 1:29:50.680
I hope you all enjoyed it,
and, uh, stay tuned,

1:29:50.710 --> 1:29:53.350
'cause I feel like what
just happened here

1:29:53.420 --> 1:29:56.550
is not going to end, uh,
in this room.

1:29:56.620 --> 1:29:58.990
Aaron: You guys are crazy.

1:29:59.020 --> 1:29:59.960
And we'll give you updates
on twitter if anything else

1:29:59.990 --> 1:30:02.920
happens to us after this,
but I think you got

1:30:02.960 --> 1:30:04.160
a little affected there.
I feel -- I still --

1:30:04.190 --> 1:30:06.830
I still can't believe
we did it!
Aaron: You guys are crazy.

1:30:06.860 --> 1:30:08.760
I mean, we did it!
That was awesome.

1:30:08.800 --> 1:30:12.430
We did it! We did it! We sat
in the devil's rocking chair.
