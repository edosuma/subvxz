to taste my donuts.

how very thoughtful.

We have discovered
that someone in Mewni

has been using
extremely powerful magic spells

that haven't been used
for centuries.

Is that so?
Any idea who's been doing it?

07:52.170 --> 07:53.330
No, but we've been
tracking it

in order to find out
where it's concentrated.

07:57.670 --> 07:59.380

is going to turn out

07:59.380 --> 08:00.710
to be Monster Castle,

08:00.710 --> 08:03.120
you really could save us
a lot of time.

08:03.120 --> 08:05.460
So you mean to tell me that
you dragged us all the way here,

08:05.460 --> 08:08.500
and bored us half to death,
just to ask me that?

08:08.500 --> 08:11.710
-Well, yeah. That's right.
-Well, duh. I mean, pretty much.

08:11.710 --> 08:15.290
Well, yeah. Between me,

08:15.290 --> 08:17.920
there are some pretty serious
magic users

in the Monster Temple.

08:19.460 --> 08:21.380
It's not Glossaryck,
and no living queen

magic like this.

Well, hasn't this been fun.

a better way

an afternoon.

your hospitality,

an eye out

No. He's just a dumb bird.

This is what they do:
take all the shiny stuff

08:55.420 --> 08:57.500
and dump it
in their nest.

the bird.

09:39.380 --> 09:40.380
Ow!

[shrieks]

09:49.330 --> 09:51.460
It's-- It's fine. You know what?
You can have the boot.

09:55.460 --> 09:56.880
[snarls]

09:56.880 --> 09:58.500
We got to get out of here!
Run!

[shrieks]

09:59.710 --> 10:01.120
You got to blast him, Tom.

10:01.120 --> 10:02.540
Yeah, yeah, okay, fine.

10:04.330 --> 10:05.620
Ha-ha! Yes!

10:08.170 --> 10:10.250
Uh, you probably
shouldn't have done that.

10:10.250 --> 10:12.000
What are you
talking about?

10:12.000 --> 10:13.790
You've been telling me
to blast him all day.

10:13.790 --> 10:15.670
Come on, we got to get
out of here.

10:15.670 --> 10:17.080
[bird shrieks]

10:21.540 --> 10:23.500
[giggles]
Knock, knock.

10:23.500 --> 10:25.080
Yo, what up?

10:25.080 --> 10:28.710
Well, look who it is.
A guy who had a fun day.

10:28.710 --> 10:31.290
Oh, yeah. We got up to some
serious weirdness.

10:31.290 --> 10:33.000
I almost died.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.420
Aw, I didn't know
you were actually

10:34.420 --> 10:35.670
going to go out
and do stuff.

10:35.670 --> 10:38.500
That makes you so much more
attractive to me.

10:38.500 --> 10:40.580
Oh, yeah, I know how
to make my own fun.

10:40.580 --> 10:43.380
Yikes, man.
You really shouldn't do that.

10:43.380 --> 10:45.080
-Hey, are those donuts?
-Wait, Tom, no, no, no!

10:45.080 --> 10:46.830
[Tom]
Oh, yeah. Tasty.

10:46.830 --> 10:48.790
Gluten-free?

10:48.790 --> 10:50.750
[shrieks]

10:58.210 --> 11:01.380
Oh, Sebastian,
my poor little baby.

11:01.380 --> 11:03.250
Did they hurt your eye?

11:03.250 --> 11:06.790
Well, don't worry.
It was all worth it.
