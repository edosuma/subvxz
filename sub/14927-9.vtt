WEBVTT

00:09.143 --> 00:10.178
LILY?

00:13.181 --> 00:16.184
UH, YOUR MOM SAYS
YOU GOT BOY TROUBLE.

00:19.387 --> 00:24.625
SO, UH, THIS
IS WHAT YOU DO?

00:24.658 --> 00:26.460
YOU PUT ON
SAD MUSIC

00:26.494 --> 00:28.529
AND STARE
AT THE FLOOR?

00:28.562 --> 00:31.732
YEAH, AND I
JUST FOCUS ON GETTING
MORE AND MORE DEPRESSED

00:31.765 --> 00:34.135
UNTIL EVENTUALLY I'M
THE MOST DEPRESSED PERSON

00:34.168 --> 00:36.637
IN THE HISTORY
OF THE EARTH.

00:36.670 --> 00:41.075
AND THAT WORKS
FOR YOU, HUH?

00:43.544 --> 00:50.084
YEAH, WELL, I'VE GOT
LOVE TROUBLE, TOO.

01:03.164 --> 01:06.134
THIS MUSIC STINKS.

01:06.167 --> 01:08.302
GRANDPA,
PLEASE LEAVE.

01:08.336 --> 01:13.141
UH, GIVE ME
A MINUTE, WILL YOU?

01:25.853 --> 01:27.121
OW!
JUST--JUST--

01:27.155 --> 01:29.323
I SAID OW!

01:29.590 --> 01:30.758
OH, HEY, BABY.
WHERE'S THE ICE?

01:30.791 --> 01:33.394
IT'S RIGHT HERE
ON YOUR BROTHER'S FACE.

01:33.427 --> 01:35.729
I CAN'T USE IT NOW.
IT'S GOT FACE ON IT.

01:35.763 --> 01:37.431
HEY, YOU GOT
A PROBLEM WITH THAT,

01:37.465 --> 01:40.701
YOU MIGHT NOT WANNA
EAT THE TOP SLICE
OF THAT HAM.

01:40.734 --> 01:43.604
CAN SOMEBODY PLEASE DO
SOMETHING ABOUT GRANDPA?

01:43.637 --> 01:44.672
I'M TRYING
TO BE DEPRESSED,

01:44.705 --> 01:46.574
AND HE'S REALLY
BRINGING ME DOWN.

01:46.607 --> 01:49.677
BABE, YOU HAVE
TO BE A LITTLE
SYMPATHETIC, OK?

01:49.710 --> 01:51.645
HE JUST GOT DUMPED
BY HIS GIRLFRIEND.

01:51.679 --> 01:53.647
WHOA. SHE WASN'T
HIS GIRLFRIEND.

01:53.681 --> 01:55.749
OK, SEAN.
WHAT WAS SHE?

01:55.783 --> 01:58.219
SHE WAS A FRIEND WHO
SO HAPPENED TO BE A WOMAN.

01:58.252 --> 02:02.323
SHE'S A...FRIEND WOMAN.

02:02.356 --> 02:03.857
DO YOU MEAN
A WOMAN FRIEND?

02:03.891 --> 02:06.860
YOU MAKE IT SOUND SO FILTHY.

02:08.429 --> 02:09.430
OK, SEAN, COME ON.

02:09.463 --> 02:11.432
LET'S SEE
THE MONEY I'LL BE
TAKING HOME TONIGHT.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.601
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
THIS IS MY MONEY.

02:13.634 --> 02:16.670
YOU GUYS
ARE GOING DOWN HARD.

02:16.704 --> 02:17.671
OH, BRING IT ON,
BITCH.

02:17.705 --> 02:19.707
I BROUGHT IT!

02:22.576 --> 02:24.778
I BROUGHT IT, AND
YOU AIN'T GETTIN' IT.

02:24.812 --> 02:25.846
UH-HUH.
YOU KNOW WHAT?

02:25.879 --> 02:29.183
TOMORROW YOU'RE
GONNA BE EATIN'
GOVERNMENT CHEESE.

02:29.217 --> 02:31.652
I ATE SOME TODAY.

02:31.685 --> 02:33.621
OH.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.523
IT'S GOOD CHEESE!

02:35.923 --> 02:38.426
OK, LADIES.
OPEN YOUR PURSES.

02:38.459 --> 02:39.460
WHOA, HEY, EDDIE,

02:39.493 --> 02:40.661
EDDIE, EDDIE, OK?
WILL YOU PLEASE

02:40.694 --> 02:41.762
GET MY BEER
OFF YOUR FACE?

02:41.795 --> 02:42.963
MAN!
ED, WHAT
HAPPENED TO YOU?

02:42.996 --> 02:45.966
I GOT TICKED OFF
AT SOME DUDES.
HOW COME?

02:45.999 --> 02:49.203
THEY WERE BEATIN' ME UP.

02:51.305 --> 02:52.072
WHO WERE THEY?

02:52.105 --> 02:54.675
I GOT A FEW THEORIES
I'M WORKIN' ON.

02:54.708 --> 02:55.609
Sean: OH, A FEW?

02:55.643 --> 02:57.578
COME ON, HALF
OF STATEN ISLAND'S
AFTER YOU.

02:57.611 --> 02:58.879
AND THE OTHER HALF LOVES ME.

02:58.912 --> 03:02.783
ALL RIGHT, COME ON.
ANTE UP. 5-CARD DRAW.

03:02.816 --> 03:03.784
HEY, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT.

03:03.817 --> 03:04.952
SHOULDN'T
WE WAIT
FOR YOUR DAD?

03:04.985 --> 03:06.554
'CAUSE, I MEAN, WE
START WITHOUT HIM,

03:06.587 --> 03:07.355
HE GONNA TEAR US
A NEW ONE.

03:07.388 --> 03:09.723
NO. NO, NO, NO, NO.
BABY, TRUST ME.

03:09.757 --> 03:12.826
WALT IS NOT IN THE MOOD
FOR POKER TONIGHT.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.662
RELATIONSHIP PROBLEMS.

03:14.695 --> 03:15.796
WALT HAS A GIRLFRIEND?

03:15.829 --> 03:17.565
SHE WASN'T
HIS GIRLFRIEND.

03:17.598 --> 03:19.567
SHE WAS A FRIEND WOMAN.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.402
BABY, JUST DEAL, PLEASE.

03:21.435 --> 03:22.703
LOOK, ALL I'M SAYING IS
THE GAME ISN'T THE SAME

03:22.736 --> 03:24.672
WITHOUT WALT, ALL RIGHT?
HE'S ALWAYS HERE.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.440
YEAH, THAT'S THE PROBLEM.
SEE, HE'S ALWAYS HERE,

03:26.474 --> 03:27.575
MORNING TILL NIGHT.

03:27.608 --> 03:29.777
IT WAS
DRIVING US NUTS.

03:29.810 --> 03:32.480
Walt: * BY THE RISING
OF THE MOON *

03:32.513 --> 03:35.383
* BY THE RISING
OF THE MOON *

03:35.416 --> 03:36.850
* WE WALKED THROUGH--

03:36.884 --> 03:39.019
WALT, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING IN HERE?

03:39.052 --> 03:43.957
OW! YOUR LEGS REALLY
DO A NUMBER ON THESE.

03:44.625 --> 03:45.993
Sean: OH, DAD, DAD!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING

03:46.026 --> 03:47.295
WITH OUR CHRISTMAS TREE?

03:47.328 --> 03:48.996
CHRISTMAS
WAS YESTERDAY.

03:49.029 --> 03:51.832
I BROUGHT DINNER.

03:51.865 --> 03:52.933
OH.

03:52.966 --> 03:54.802
UH, WHOA. HEY, DAD,
UH, YOUR DINNER

03:54.835 --> 03:57.271
JUST CRACKED
OUR COUNTER.

03:57.305 --> 03:58.872
THIS IS A PORK ROAST

03:58.906 --> 04:01.809
MADE BY YOUR MOTHER,
GOD REST HER SOUL.

04:01.842 --> 04:03.411
WELL, THEN, IT'S GOTTA
BE OVER 2 YEARS OLD.

04:03.444 --> 04:04.678
IT'S BEEN
IN THE FREEZER.

04:04.712 --> 04:08.416
AND FOR DESSERT,
CREAM PUFFS!

04:09.817 --> 04:11.385
THAT'S GREAT, GREAT.
AND IF WE DON'T EAT 'EM,

04:11.419 --> 04:13.854
WE CAN ALWAYS STONE
THE VILLAGE HARLOT.

04:13.887 --> 04:16.724
DAMN, THAT'S
SOME OLD MEAT.

04:16.757 --> 04:19.793
OUR MOM HAD
THIS HUGE FREEZER
IN THE BASEMENT

04:19.827 --> 04:20.594
FULL OF LEFTOVERS.

04:20.628 --> 04:22.396
SHE'S BEEN GONE
FOR, LIKE, 2 YEARS,

04:22.430 --> 04:24.765
SHE STILL FEEDS WALT
EVERY NIGHT.

04:24.798 --> 04:27.835
LOOK--LOOK WHAT
HE BROUGHT OVER
FOR US TONIGHT.

04:27.868 --> 04:31.339
AAH! WHAT IS IT?
LASAGNA?

04:31.372 --> 04:32.340
WE DON'T KNOW.

04:32.373 --> 04:34.675
IT'S LABELED
"MEAT LOAF."

04:35.343 --> 04:38.412
WHAT? I THINK
I SEE A BONE IN IT.

04:38.446 --> 04:39.847
NO KIDDING. WE COULD
NOT KEEP LIVING LIKE THIS.

04:39.880 --> 04:43.684
WE HAD TO FIND WALT
SOME SORT OF LIFE.

04:43.717 --> 04:46.019
CHECK IT.
I'M GONNA JAM.

04:46.787 --> 04:47.488
Claudia: YEAH!

04:47.521 --> 04:48.922
ALL RIGHT.
WHAT WOULD YOU GUYS DO

04:48.956 --> 04:49.690
IF YOU WERE AN OLD GUY

04:49.723 --> 04:51.091
AND YOU WANTED
TO MAKE NEW FRIENDS?

04:51.124 --> 04:52.626
GO ON THE INTERNET,

04:52.660 --> 04:54.662
PRETEND TO BE A GIRL.

04:54.695 --> 04:56.864
YOU ALREADY DO THAT.

04:57.898 --> 05:01.469
BOWLING.
BOWLING.

05:01.835 --> 05:02.836
BOWLING?

05:02.870 --> 05:03.604
BOWLING.

05:03.637 --> 05:04.638
WELL, HE AND MA
USED TO GO BOWLING

05:04.672 --> 05:07.074
ALL THE TIME,
SO WE SIGNED HIM UP
FOR A LEAGUE.

05:07.107 --> 05:08.876
OOH! I'LL BET
50 CENTS.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.911
I'M IN.

05:11.779 --> 05:13.013
HEE!

05:14.081 --> 05:16.784
CUT IT OUT.
I'LL TAKE, UH, ONE.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.586
MM-HMM.

05:19.853 --> 05:21.589
UHH.

05:21.622 --> 05:22.790
I RAISE.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.091
I FOLD.

05:24.124 --> 05:26.694
JIMMY, TAKE
YOUR BROTHER
OUT OF HERE.

05:26.727 --> 05:28.829
I DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING!

05:28.862 --> 05:29.830
THANKS FOR GETTING US

05:29.863 --> 05:30.664
KICKED OUT
OF THE POKER GAME.

05:30.698 --> 05:33.667
HOW AM I SUPPOSED
TO CONTROL MY FACE?

05:33.701 --> 05:34.868
IT'S YOUR FACE!

05:34.902 --> 05:38.472
IT DOES WHATEVER
IT WANTS. LOOK.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.409
I DIDN'T DO THAT.

05:41.442 --> 05:43.411
WILL YOU GUYS
PLEASE BUZZ OFF?

05:43.444 --> 05:45.913
WE CAN'T. WE GOT KICKED
OUT OF THE DINING ROOM,

05:45.946 --> 05:47.848
AND GRANDPA'S UPSTAIRS
LYING ON YOUR BED

05:47.881 --> 05:49.950
LISTENING
TO TORI AMOS.

05:50.784 --> 05:53.587
WHY ARE YOU STARING
AT BRAD'S HOUSE?

05:53.621 --> 05:54.287
I'M NOT.

05:54.321 --> 05:55.923
AND BRAD IS NOT
MY BOYFRIEND.

05:55.956 --> 05:56.724
IF HE WERE,
I WOULD CARE

05:56.757 --> 05:58.792
THAT HE WAS OVER
THERE WITH KRISTINA,

05:58.826 --> 06:00.728
AND I DON'T.

06:00.761 --> 06:03.931
I LIKE KRISTINA.
SHE'S PRETTY.

06:03.964 --> 06:05.999
SHE ONLY
LOOKS PRETTY.

06:06.033 --> 06:07.100
ALL RIGHT.
I'VE GOT IT.

06:07.134 --> 06:08.702
YOU'VE GONE INSANE.

06:08.736 --> 06:10.938
YOU TWO COULDN'T
POSSIBLY UNDERSTAND.

06:10.971 --> 06:13.173
SEE, I WAS AT SCHOOL
YESTERDAY...

06:13.206 --> 06:15.543
HEY, LILY.

06:15.576 --> 06:18.612
HEH, I GOT
A NEW PLAYSTATION 2.

06:18.879 --> 06:20.548
I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU WANTED

06:20.581 --> 06:21.549
TO COME OVER TO MY HOUSE
SATURDAY NIGHT

06:21.582 --> 06:25.085
AND PLAY
TEKKEN TAG TOURNAMENT
IN MY BASEMENT.

06:27.087 --> 06:29.423
LOOK, BRAD,
WE'RE JUST NEIGHBORS.

06:29.457 --> 06:31.925
WE DON'T DO THINGS, OK?

06:31.959 --> 06:34.962
WE JUST WENT TO
ICE CAPADES, REMEMBER?

06:34.995 --> 06:37.931
REMEMBER? I BOUGHT YOU
ONE OF THESE.

06:39.633 --> 06:41.435
TURN IT OFF!

06:43.036 --> 06:45.906
UH, I'M SORRY.

06:46.474 --> 06:48.709
BRAD'S
KINDA CUTE.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.678
GROSS.

06:50.711 --> 06:54.047
HE'S GOT TEKKEN
TAG TOURNAMENT?

06:54.081 --> 06:55.716
WHY CAN'T WE PLAY?

06:55.749 --> 06:57.618
BECAUSE IF
MOM FOUND OUT
YOU WERE PLAYING

06:57.651 --> 06:59.953
SOME VIOLENT
VIDEO GAME,
SHE'D MURDER YOU.

06:59.987 --> 07:03.824
WAIT. SO WHAT DID BRAD
DO THAT WAS SO WRONG?

07:03.857 --> 07:05.859
HE INVITED KRISTINA OVER.

07:05.893 --> 07:06.794
EXACTLY.

07:06.827 --> 07:09.029
AND SHE
SAID YES BECAUSE
SHE'S A BIG SLU--

07:09.062 --> 07:14.134
BECAUSE SHE--BECAUSE
SHE SAYS YES A LOT!

07:15.102 --> 07:16.904
AND NOW THE TWO
OF THEM ARE TOGETHER

07:16.937 --> 07:18.706
IN HIS BASEMENT
RIGHT NEXT DOOR!

07:18.739 --> 07:23.043
OH, MY GOD. THEY COULD
BE DOING ANYTHING.

07:23.076 --> 07:25.613
OH, KRISTINA.

07:25.646 --> 07:27.781
BRAD.

07:29.116 --> 07:31.018
COME ON. YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

07:31.051 --> 07:34.955
SEE, I KNEW YOU
WEREN'T OLD ENOUGH
TO UNDERSTAND.

07:34.988 --> 07:37.558
MAN, I WANNA BE BRAD.

07:38.091 --> 07:40.160
OK, OK, I WANT YOU
TO GO OVER TO HIS HOUSE

07:40.193 --> 07:43.063
AND TELL HIM THAT I'M
NOT TALKING TO HIM ANYMORE.

07:43.096 --> 07:44.798
WELL, COULDN'T YOU
JUST LET HIM KNOW

07:44.832 --> 07:45.499
YOU'RE NOT TALKING
TO HIM

07:45.533 --> 07:49.036
BY JUST...NOT
TALKING TO HIM?

07:49.069 --> 07:51.238
NO, NO, NO. THAT
WOULD TAKE TOO LONG.

07:51.271 --> 07:53.941
NO. NO! OK, OK,
HERE, HERE.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.876
TAKE MY SOCIAL STUDIES
BOOK AND TELL HIM--

07:55.909 --> 07:58.145
TELL HIM TO KEEP HIS STUFF
OUT OF MY HOUSE.

07:58.178 --> 08:00.213
BUT THIS
IS YOUR BOOK.

08:00.247 --> 08:01.081
UHH! JUST GO!

08:01.114 --> 08:06.053
IT'S LIKE
I'M SPEAKING SPANISH.

08:06.086 --> 08:06.954
OH, HEY, DAD.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.021
HEY, WALT.
HEY, WALT.
HEY.

08:08.055 --> 08:09.657
YOU WANT US TO DEAL YOU IN?

08:09.690 --> 08:10.958
NO, THANKS.

08:10.991 --> 08:14.995
LIFE'S ALREADY DEALT ME
A HAND FULL OF CRAP.

08:18.031 --> 08:20.534
WELL, THE BOWLING
LEAGUE REALLY
CHEERED HIM UP.

08:20.568 --> 08:23.904
WELL--WELL, IT DID
AT FIRST. IT WAS GREAT.

08:23.937 --> 08:26.940
HOW ARE YOU
DOING, SON?

08:26.974 --> 08:30.210
CLAUDIA,
YOU LOOK LOVELY.

08:30.243 --> 08:32.079
MM-WAH!

08:32.112 --> 08:35.883
THAT WAS THE SCARIEST
KISS OF MY LIFE.

08:35.916 --> 08:39.219
AND I'VE BEEN KISSED
BY ONE OF THE GAMBINOS.

08:39.987 --> 08:40.721
SO HE LOVES BOWLING.

08:40.754 --> 08:42.856
NOBODY LOVES
BOWLING THAT MUCH.

08:42.890 --> 08:44.658
YOU'RE RIGHT, BECAUSE
IF HE LOVED IT THAT MUCH,

08:44.692 --> 08:47.928
HE WOULDN'T HAVE FORGOTTEN
HIS BALL AT MY HOUSE.

08:47.961 --> 08:49.763
YOU KNOW, WHENEVER
I SEE A BOWLING BAG,

08:49.797 --> 08:51.064
I CAN'T HELP
BUT WONDER IF MAYBE

08:51.098 --> 08:52.132
THERE'S A HUMAN HEAD
IN THERE.

08:52.165 --> 08:53.166
WELL, THERE'S NOT.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.101
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

08:54.134 --> 08:54.902
'CAUSE IT'S
NOT THAT HEAVY.

08:54.935 --> 08:58.071
OH, YOU KNOW HOW
MUCH A HEAD WEIGHS.

08:58.772 --> 09:01.809
OK. NOW WE KNOW.

09:13.320 --> 09:15.589
SON OF A BI--

09:17.925 --> 09:18.558
Claudia:
I'LL SEE YOUR DOLLAR,

09:18.592 --> 09:21.261
AND I'LL
RAISE YOU A DOLLAR.

09:21.294 --> 09:22.229
Sean: I'M OUT.

09:22.262 --> 09:23.363
Kenny: ME, TOO.

09:23.396 --> 09:24.898
I'M OUT.

09:24.932 --> 09:26.033
I'M IN.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.601
SEAN,
LEND ME A BUCK.

09:27.635 --> 09:29.369
OH...
NO, NO WAY!

09:29.402 --> 09:30.638
JUST FOLD.

09:30.671 --> 09:32.572
NO, NO, NO.

09:33.373 --> 09:35.943
YOU'RE GONNA
RAISE ME A CAR?

09:35.976 --> 09:36.877
YEAH.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.011
YOU CAN'T
RAISE A CAR.

09:38.045 --> 09:39.780
TOO RICH
FOR YOUR BLOOD?

09:39.813 --> 09:41.014
YEAH.

09:41.048 --> 09:42.149
THEN I GUESS
I WIN.

09:42.182 --> 09:43.383
NO, YOU DON'T!

09:43.416 --> 09:45.819
OK! OK, HERE,
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.

09:45.853 --> 09:46.820
FINE. ALL RIGHT.

09:46.854 --> 09:48.388
FULL HOUSE,
JACKS AND 3s.

09:48.421 --> 09:51.024
OK, WHAT'S WILD?

09:52.125 --> 09:53.293
NOTHING.

09:53.326 --> 09:54.995
CRAP.

09:56.196 --> 09:57.397
COME TO MAMA!

09:57.430 --> 09:59.032
YOU KNOW, ED, COULD
THAT PUMMELING THAT YOU TOOK

09:59.066 --> 10:02.035
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO
WITH YOUR GAMBLING STYLE?

10:02.069 --> 10:03.103
IT'S POSSIBLE.

10:03.136 --> 10:06.073
Dealer: HERE SHE IS,
THERE SHE GOES.

10:06.106 --> 10:09.009
KEEP YOUR EYE ON HER.

10:09.042 --> 10:11.211
FIND THE QUEEN, GET THE GREEN.

10:12.045 --> 10:14.715
Eddie: YEAH.

10:14.748 --> 10:16.684
ALL RIGHT, QUEEN!

10:16.717 --> 10:19.419
WHAT THE HELL?
OUR CARDS HAVE BLUE BACKS.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.121
THIS HAS A RED BACK.

10:21.154 --> 10:23.190
THAT'S ODD.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.295
YOU BROUGHT
YOUR OWN CARDS

10:28.328 --> 10:30.831
TO A 3-CARD MONTE GAME.

10:30.864 --> 10:33.000
ARE YOU INSANE?

10:33.033 --> 10:33.834
HEY, I MADE 20 BUCKS

10:33.867 --> 10:35.836
AND I BROKE UP
THEIR LITTLE CRIME RING.

10:35.869 --> 10:39.139
YOU KICKED OVER
A CARDBOARD BOX.

10:39.172 --> 10:41.041
OH! OH! WHAT'VE YOU
GOT FOR ME?

10:41.074 --> 10:43.143
COME ON. WHAT WERE
BRAD AND KRISTINA
DOING?

10:43.176 --> 10:46.079
OH, MAN, THEY WERE
REALLY GOING AT IT.

10:46.113 --> 10:49.116
YEAH, SHE WAS
THE BIG LIZARD GUY
WITH THE AXE.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.050
AND HE WAS THIS NINJA,

10:50.083 --> 10:52.319
AND HE WAS KICKING HER.
IT WAS LIKE, "WAAA!"

10:52.352 --> 10:55.856
OH, NOT
THE VIDEO GAME,
YOU IDIOTS!

10:55.889 --> 10:57.324
MAN, I WISH
WE COULD GET ONE.

10:57.357 --> 10:59.727
I'D SELL MY EYE.

11:00.193 --> 11:01.361
LISTEN TO ME.
I NEED TO KNOW.

11:01.394 --> 11:02.930
DID IT SEEM
LIKE THEY WERE,

11:02.963 --> 11:04.264
YOU KNOW,
TOGETHER?

11:04.297 --> 11:04.998
Jimmy:
I DON'T KNOW.

11:05.032 --> 11:06.466
WHEN ME AND HENRY
HAD OUR TURN,

11:06.499 --> 11:07.901
THEY WENT
INTO THE KITCHEN.

11:07.935 --> 11:10.203
I KNEW IT.
I KNEW IT!

11:10.237 --> 11:11.438
THEY--THEY
TOTALLY MADE OUT!

11:11.471 --> 11:13.473
THEY WERE TOTALLY
MAKING OUT!

11:13.506 --> 11:16.109
WE GOT TO PLAY THAT GAME
FOR, LIKE, AN HOUR.

11:16.143 --> 11:17.845
THOSE SUCKERS!

11:18.145 --> 11:20.013
HEY, SHOULDN'T YOU GUYS
BE GETTING UPSTAIRS,

11:20.047 --> 11:21.081
GETTING READY FOR BED?

11:21.114 --> 11:23.483
UH, WE DON'T WANT
TO GO UPSTAIRS.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.886
YEAH. GRANDPA'S
UP THERE.

11:25.919 --> 11:26.754
WHAT'S HIS PROBLEM?

11:26.787 --> 11:32.325
HE JUST GOT DUMPED
BY HIS...FRIEND WOMAN.

11:32.793 --> 11:34.494
IS THAT KINDA
LIKE A GIRLFRIEND?

11:34.527 --> 11:35.428
NO! NO,
IT'S NOT.

11:35.462 --> 11:39.066
NO...OK,
IT'S THE OPPOSITE
OF A GIRLFRIEND.

11:39.099 --> 11:41.301
IS IT
A BOYFRIEND?

11:43.270 --> 11:46.139
GO UPSTAIRS.

11:46.774 --> 11:47.507
ALL RIGHT, I'M SORRY,

11:47.540 --> 11:48.341
IT'S PROBABLY
NONE OF MY BUSINESS,

11:48.375 --> 11:51.378
BUT HE WAS KISSING
ON THIS LADY, RIGHT?

11:51.411 --> 11:53.747
YEAH. WHAT'S
YOUR POINT?

11:53.781 --> 11:56.016
WELL, I--THAT'S KINDA...

11:56.049 --> 11:57.150
GIRLFRIEND-LIKE
BEHAVIOR.

11:57.184 --> 11:59.152
OK, OK. OK,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

11:59.186 --> 12:01.221
MAYBE MY DAD WAS
INTO THIS WOMAN, OK?

12:01.254 --> 12:05.225
BUT TRUST ME,
THIS LADY WAS TROUBLE.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.430
LOOK AT DAD, HMM?

12:10.463 --> 12:12.232
LOOK AT HIM
ACTING LIKE A HORNDOG.

12:12.265 --> 12:14.434
IT'S SO DISGUSTING.

12:15.102 --> 12:17.337
HE WANTS TO HAVE
SEX WITH HER.

12:21.274 --> 12:22.075
SHE WANTS HIS MONEY.

12:22.109 --> 12:24.377
SHE'S A GOLD DIGGER.

12:24.411 --> 12:26.046
MAKES ME SICK.

12:26.079 --> 12:28.181
GOLD DIGGER?
YOUR DAD DON'T
HAVE ANY MONEY.

12:28.215 --> 12:30.183
HE WORKS
AT THE DUMP.

12:30.217 --> 12:31.451
YEAH, BUT HE'S
GOT DENTAL BENEFITS.

12:31.484 --> 12:34.054
YOU SAW HER TEETH.
SHE LOOKS LIKE
A HOCKEY PLAYER.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.156
SOMETHING, ALL RIGHT,
WAS DEFINITELY UP.

12:36.189 --> 12:38.859
SO AS SOON AS WALT LEFT,
WE GOT INTO IT.

12:38.892 --> 12:40.360
HI, GUYS. YOU

12:40.393 --> 12:44.097
THAT'S WHAT, UH,

12:45.465 --> 12:47.367

12:50.003 --> 12:50.570
AND YOU, SIR?

12:50.603 --> 12:52.940
I'VE GOT
A LOT OF MONEY.

12:52.973 --> 12:53.807
ED--
EXCUSE ME?

12:53.841 --> 12:55.876
DO YOU LIKE MONEY?
I'VE GOT A LOT OF IT.

12:55.909 --> 12:58.011
LOOK, JUST GIVE HER
YOUR SHOE SIZE.

12:58.045 --> 13:00.113
I'M ATTRACTED TO WOMEN
WHO LIKE MY MONEY.

13:00.147 --> 13:03.884
I REALLY--I DON'T--
I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHAT YOU'RE--

13:03.917 --> 13:05.385
HE'S DRUNK AND...

13:05.418 --> 13:08.288
YEAH, BABY.
DRUNK WITH MONEY.

13:08.321 --> 13:10.390
UHH.

13:11.091 --> 13:12.292
HE DOESN'T
HAVE ANY MONEY.

13:12.325 --> 13:14.361
LISTEN, SUGAR.
HOW 'BOUT I BUY YOU

13:14.394 --> 13:16.796
A ROB ROY AND A CORN DOG?

13:17.931 --> 13:20.200
YOU KNOW, IF MY
LATE HUSBAND WERE HERE,

13:20.233 --> 13:23.103
YOU'D BE
IN BIG TROUBLE, SON.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.371
I'M NOT YOUR SON.

13:24.404 --> 13:26.239
I'M NEVER GONNA
BE YOUR SON.

13:26.273 --> 13:28.241
LLOYD!

13:29.309 --> 13:30.210
HEY, LLOYD--

13:30.243 --> 13:34.514
I WILL NEVER
CALL YOU MOMMY!

13:36.183 --> 13:39.386
I'M--I'M GOING.
I'M GOING.

13:39.953 --> 13:41.488
HEY!

13:41.521 --> 13:44.858
WHY? YOU WANT
A PIECE OF ME?

13:47.327 --> 13:49.229
YOU TWO ARE
UNBELIEVABLE.

13:49.262 --> 13:50.864
WHAT

13:50.898 --> 13:52.165
I--I WASN'T
PLAYING THE PART

13:52.199 --> 13:55.302
OF THE, UH, HORNY
MILLIONAIRE BOWLER.

13:55.668 --> 13:57.070
AT LEAST
I HAD A PLAN.

13:57.104 --> 13:59.306
OH, NICE PLAN.
GOT YOUR BUTT KICKED.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.408
THAT HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT.

14:01.441 --> 14:04.311
I HAVE REASON
TO BELIEVE IT WAS
BUSINESS-RELATED.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.980
RANGERS TICKETS.
RANGERS TICKETS!

14:07.014 --> 14:08.481
WHO NEEDS 2?
WHO NEEDS 2?

14:08.515 --> 14:09.549
YO! HOW MUCH?

14:09.582 --> 14:12.052
200 BUCKS,
RED SECTION.

14:12.319 --> 14:14.387
ALL RIGHT.

14:17.057 --> 14:20.127
HEY! THESE TICKETS ARE
FOR LAST NIGHT'S GAME!

14:20.160 --> 14:20.894
THAT WAS
A GREAT GAME, MAN.

14:20.928 --> 14:23.263
THAT'S LIKE
MEMORABILIA, MAN.

14:23.296 --> 14:24.397
MEMORABILIA!

14:24.431 --> 14:27.367
GET BACK HERE WITH
MY MONEY, YOU LITTLE...

14:27.400 --> 14:30.303
I WANNA KICK YOUR BUTT
AND I WASN'T EVEN THERE.

14:30.337 --> 14:33.606
OK, LISTEN. A GREAT
LEADER ONCE SAID,

14:33.640 --> 14:35.375
"YOU CAN TAKE
THE MEASURE OF A MAN

14:35.408 --> 14:38.078
BY COUNTING
HIS ENEMIES."

14:38.111 --> 14:38.845
WHO SAID THAT?

14:38.878 --> 14:42.415
I DON'T KNOW. SOME
KHMER ROUGE GUY.

14:43.984 --> 14:45.085
LILY?

14:45.118 --> 14:49.089
BRAD! WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

14:49.122 --> 14:50.223
UH, YOUR BROTHERS LEFT

14:50.257 --> 14:52.993
YOUR SOCIAL STUDIES BOOK
IN MY BASEMENT.

14:53.026 --> 14:55.662
OH, DORKS.

14:56.296 --> 14:58.365
SO, UH, YOU GUYS
HAVE FUN?

14:58.398 --> 15:01.234
WHAT--DID KRISTINA
TELL YOU WE DID?

15:01.268 --> 15:04.637
I DIDN'T--I DIDN'T TALK
TO KRISTINA, OK?

15:04.671 --> 15:06.239
I JUST KNOW THAT SHE
CAME OVER TO YOUR HOUSE

15:06.273 --> 15:08.641
AND WAS PLAYING GAMES
WITH YOU DOWN
IN YOUR BASEMENT,

15:08.675 --> 15:10.643
AND WHEN I HEARD THAT,
I GOT KIND OF SAD,

15:10.677 --> 15:12.445
BECAUSE WE PLAY GAMES
IN THAT BASEMENT,

15:12.479 --> 15:14.714
AND NOW YOU'RE IN
THAT BASEMENT WITH HER,

15:14.747 --> 15:17.184
AND I LIKE YOU!

15:17.217 --> 15:17.951
WHA--

15:17.985 --> 15:20.187
GIMME MY STUPID BOOK.

15:20.220 --> 15:22.489
DID YOU SAY
YOU LIKED ME?

15:22.522 --> 15:24.591
NO.

15:26.659 --> 15:29.462
I ROCK!

15:34.434 --> 15:35.135
SORRY.

15:35.168 --> 15:38.438
ALL RIGHT, UH,
2 KINGS. HA HA HA!

15:38.471 --> 15:41.374
UH, STRAIGHT FLUSH,
QUEEN HIGH.

15:41.408 --> 15:42.675
WHOA, WAIT A MINUTE.

15:42.709 --> 15:43.743
THIS QUEEN
HAS A RED BACK

15:43.776 --> 15:47.080
AND THE REST OF THESE CARDS
HAVE BLUE BACKS, EDDIE.

15:47.647 --> 15:49.082
MISDEAL.

15:49.116 --> 15:50.383
UH-UH-UH! NO!

15:50.417 --> 15:54.287
YEAH, SOMETIMES
YOU'RE DEALT
A QUEEN,

15:54.321 --> 15:57.624
BUT YOU JUST
CAN'T KEEP HER.

16:00.093 --> 16:00.927
OH, GOD.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.695
SO WHY EXACTLY DID
THIS HOTTIE DUMP HIM?

16:02.729 --> 16:07.334
WELL, I DON'T KNOW.
IT JUST HAPPENED
OUT OF THE BLUE.

16:07.367 --> 16:08.601
I WAS OVER AT HIS HOUSE,

16:08.635 --> 16:10.437
AND HE WAS GETTING
READY FOR THE DATE.

16:10.470 --> 16:11.304
YOU'RE DRESSED
KIND OF FANCY.

16:11.338 --> 16:13.706
OH, JUST TRYING
TO BRING A LITTLE CLASS

16:13.740 --> 16:16.343
BACK TO THE GREAT
GAME OF BOWLING.

16:16.376 --> 16:17.777
HUH.

16:17.810 --> 16:20.147
HEY, ARE YOU
WEARING COLOGNE?

16:20.180 --> 16:24.351
HEY, DON'T SMELL IT
ALL UP. IT'S EXPENSIVE.

16:28.688 --> 16:31.324
IS THAT THE TIE CLIP
MA GAVE YOU?

16:31.358 --> 16:35.495
YEAH, FOR OUR
25th ANNIVERSARY.

16:36.829 --> 16:39.732
YEAH. YEAH,
THE GUYS'LL LOVE IT.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.468

16:47.440 --> 16:49.509
UH, HELLO.

16:49.542 --> 16:50.710
OH, HI.

16:50.743 --> 16:52.745
UM, MY NAME'S IRENE.

16:52.779 --> 16:55.482
OH, IT'S--
IT'S A PLEASURE
TO MEET YOU.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.217
I'M SEAN.
I'M WALT'S SON.

16:57.250 --> 16:59.386
UM, IS--IS
YOUR FATHER HERE?

16:59.419 --> 17:00.653
YEAH, HE'S UPSTAIRS
GETTING READY.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.822
HE'LL BE DOWN
IN JUST A MINUTE.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.625
WELL, YOU KNOW, I DON'T
REALLY HAVE A MINUTE,

17:05.658 --> 17:07.360
SO COULD YOU
JUST TELL WALTER

17:07.394 --> 17:09.162
THAT I CAN'T
SEE HIM ANYMORE

17:09.196 --> 17:10.797
AND THAT
I'M REALLY SORRY?

17:12.399 --> 17:13.766
I GOTTA GO.

17:16.503 --> 17:18.771
THAT'S HARSH, MAN.
WHY WOULD SHE DO THAT?

17:18.805 --> 17:19.506
I DON'T KNOW.
IT WAS REALLY AWFUL.

17:19.539 --> 17:22.109
YOU KNOW,
I'LL TAKE 3 CARDS.

17:22.142 --> 17:24.244
YOU KNOW, HERE'S WHAT
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

17:24.277 --> 17:27.380
HADN'T YOU
JUST TALKED TO HER
AT THE BOWLING ALLEY?

17:27.414 --> 17:28.548
YEAH.

17:28.581 --> 17:31.184
WELL, WASN'T SHE
A LITTLE FREAKED OUT

17:31.218 --> 17:32.785
TO SEE YOU
AT WALT'S DOOR?

17:32.819 --> 17:35.522
OH, YEAH.

17:35.555 --> 17:38.458
YEAH, YOU KNOW--
YEAH, SHE WAS.

17:38.491 --> 17:42.429
SHE WAS A LITTLE
FREAKED OUT, COME
TO THINK OF IT.

17:44.831 --> 17:45.498
HELLO?

17:45.532 --> 17:47.467
YOU? WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

17:47.500 --> 17:49.169
HI. I'M SORRY,
I'M WALT'S SON.

17:49.202 --> 17:53.140
I REALIZE MY BEHAVIOR
AT THE BOWLING ALLEY

17:53.173 --> 17:54.073
MUST HAVE SEEMED WEIRD.

17:54.107 --> 17:55.808
IT'S JUST MY BROTHER
AND I ARE VERY CONCERNED

17:55.842 --> 17:57.610
ABOUT OUR FATHER AND...

17:57.644 --> 17:58.778
WE WERE CLEARLY WRONG.

17:58.811 --> 18:00.747
HE'S ACTUALLY GONNA BE
DOWN IN JUST A MINUTE.

18:00.780 --> 18:03.450
WELL, YOU KNOW, I DON'T
REALLY HAVE A MINUTE,

18:03.483 --> 18:05.185
SO WHY DON'T YOU
JUST TELL WALTER

18:05.218 --> 18:07.320
THAT I CAN'T
SEE HIM ANYMORE.

18:07.354 --> 18:08.888
WHAT

18:08.921 --> 18:11.691
BECAUSE I'VE DECIDED
TO GET BACK TOGETHER
WITH MY EX-HUSBAND,

18:11.724 --> 18:13.860
AND I HOPE THAT
HE CAN UNDERSTAND.

18:13.893 --> 18:16.729
BUT HE'S...

18:17.864 --> 18:19.832
WAIT A MINUTE.

18:19.866 --> 18:22.302
DIDN'T EDDIE SAY
SHE WAS A WIDOW?

18:22.335 --> 18:23.370
YEAH, SHE IS.

18:23.403 --> 18:24.404
UH, WELL--

18:24.437 --> 18:27.474
SO SHE GOT BACK TOGETHER
WITH HER DEAD EX

18:27.507 --> 18:29.742
OK! OK! I DID IT!

18:29.776 --> 18:31.611
ALL RIGHT
IT'S MY FAULT,

18:31.644 --> 18:32.612
AND I KNOW IT'S AWFUL,

18:32.645 --> 18:35.715
AND IT--BUT IT WAS DRIVING
ME CRAZY AND I DID IT.

18:36.749 --> 18:37.584
HELLO?

18:37.617 --> 18:39.886
YOU! WHAT ARE--
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

18:39.919 --> 18:41.288

18:41.321 --> 18:42.822
WHAT AM I DOING HERE?

18:42.855 --> 18:43.923
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

18:43.956 --> 18:45.558
YOU SEE THOSE STEPS
YOU WALKED UP?

18:45.592 --> 18:48.561
MY MOTHER
