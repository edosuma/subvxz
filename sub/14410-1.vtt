00:45.500 --> 00:47.400
Garbage.

00:48.900 --> 00:53.400
All I've been thinking about all week
is garbage. I can't stop thinking about it.

00:53.700 --> 00:56.100
What kind of thoughts about garbage?

00:56.300 --> 01:02.199
I just... I've gotten real concerned over
what's gonna happen with all the garbage.

01:02.599 --> 01:05.799
I mean, we've got so much of it.

01:05.999 --> 01:10.099
You know? I mean, we have to run out
of places to put this stuff eventually.

01:10.899 --> 01:17.299
The last time... I started feelin' this way
is when that barge was stranded

01:17.799 --> 01:21.898
and, you know, it was goin' around
the island and nobody would claim it.

01:22.298 --> 01:25.498
- Do you remember that?
- Yes, I remember.

01:26.798 --> 01:30.298
Do you have any idea
what may have triggered this concern?

01:30.698 --> 01:32.798
Yeah. Yeah.

01:33.298 --> 01:36.898
You see, the other night
John was taking out the garbage,

01:37.198 --> 01:39.998
and he kept spilling things
out of the container,

01:40.298 --> 01:42.898
and that made me...

01:43.198 --> 01:48.497
I started imagining, like,
a garbage can that produces garbage.

01:49.397 --> 01:53.197
And it doesn't stop, it keeps producing
garbage. And it keeps overflowing.

01:53.397 --> 01:57.797
And, you know, what would you do
to try to stop something like that?

01:59.697 --> 02:04.797
- Ann, do you see any pattern here?
- What do you mean?

02:05.397 --> 02:07.497
Well, last week we were talking about

02:07.697 --> 02:10.696
your obsession with
the families of airline fatalities.

02:10.996 --> 02:14.696
Now we're talking about your
concern over the garbage problem.

02:14.896 --> 02:16.896
Yeah... So?

02:17.296 --> 02:21.396
Well, if you think about it, I think
you'll see the object of your obsession

02:21.796 --> 02:26.296
is invariably something negative
which you have no control over.

02:28.296 --> 02:31.896
Yeah, but how many people do you think

02:32.096 --> 02:35.395
run around obsessing over
how great and how happy things are?

02:35.695 --> 02:40.395
You know, I mean, maybe they do,
but I don't think they're in therapy.

02:41.795 --> 02:46.195
Anyway... bein' happy isn't all that great.

02:47.295 --> 02:52.395
I mean, the last time
I was really happy, I got so fat.

02:52.895 --> 02:55.395
I must've put on 25 pounds.

02:56.894 --> 02:59.594
I thought John was gonna have a stroke.

03:02.194 --> 03:05.294
- So, what are you worried about?
- What am I looking at here?

03:05.494 --> 03:08.094
- Is this a mistake?
- Depends on your point of view.

03:08.294 --> 03:12.294
I don't think so. In fact,
I'm gonna tell you a little secret.

03:14.094 --> 03:18.194
As soon as you get a ring on your finger,
you start getting spectacular attention

03:18.494 --> 03:20.893
- from the opposite gender.
- That's bullshit!

03:21.093 --> 03:23.693
Seriously. I wish I had
Super Bowl seats for every time

03:24.093 --> 03:27.993
some filly had come up and talked to me
without the slightest provocation.

03:28.193 --> 03:31.593
- It's just marvellous.
- That happened before you got married.

03:31.993 --> 03:34.593
No, no, no.
It never happened before I got married.

03:34.793 --> 03:38.193
If I'd known, I'd have bought a ring
when I was 18 and saved myself...

03:38.393 --> 03:39.893
Yeah, right!

03:40.093 --> 03:42.093
...a lot of time and money.

03:42.393 --> 03:44.292
No, I wish somebody'd clued me in.

03:44.492 --> 03:46.692
I'm tellin' you.

03:46.992 --> 03:50.192
It's too weird.
Oh, shit, I gotta be someplace.

03:50.492 --> 03:52.992
- So, racquetball Thursday, right?
- How about 7.30?

03:53.292 --> 03:56.092
- Yeah, fine. See you later. Bye.
- Bye-bye.

04:02.392 --> 04:04.592
- Yes, sir?
- Janet.

04:04.792 --> 04:09.591
Reschedule Kirkland for, uh, Friday, 1.30.

04:09.991 --> 04:11.991
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

04:20.291 --> 04:23.391
Are you still
keeping these thoughts from John?

04:23.591 --> 04:25.491
Yeah.

04:25.791 --> 04:29.391
Are you afraid of his finding you silly
at thinking these things?

04:29.691 --> 04:31.790
No, it's not that. It's just...

04:31.990 --> 04:34.490
- I'm really angry at him right now.
- Why?

04:34.790 --> 04:40.290
He invited this college friend of his to
stay at our house and didn't even ask me.

04:40.890 --> 04:43.490
I'm gonna say yes, of course, but...

04:43.690 --> 04:47.190
you know, it just would've
been nice to have been asked.

04:47.490 --> 04:49.790
What upsets you about that?

04:50.690 --> 04:54.689
I guess it makes me angry
because I can't justify bein' angry.

04:54.989 --> 04:57.689
It's his house. He pays the mortgage.

04:57.889 --> 05:02.089
Yes, but he asked you to quit your job,
and you do have housework.

05:02.489 --> 05:04.789
Yeah. I have housework. That's true.

05:06.089 --> 05:10.589
This unexpected guest notwithstanding,
how are things with John?

05:10.989 --> 05:12.789
Oh, they're fine.

05:13.089 --> 05:17.289
Ex cept for I'm going through this thing
where I don't want him to touch me, but...

05:17.589 --> 05:20.788
When did you begin having this feeling?

05:21.088 --> 05:23.688
Well... last week.

05:23.888 --> 05:29.388
I don't know, I just... I got this
really strange feelin', and... ugh...

05:30.388 --> 05:32.988
just didn't want him to touch me.

05:33.388 --> 05:38.588
Prior to this feeling, were you
comfortable with contact with John?

05:38.988 --> 05:41.288
Oh, yeah. Sure. Yeah.

05:43.487 --> 05:46.387
Ex cept for... well...

05:47.487 --> 05:49.687
I've never really been that much into sex.

05:50.787 --> 05:53.787
I mean, I like it and everything, but...

05:54.787 --> 05:59.287
You know, I just don't think
it's such a big deal, and...

06:01.887 --> 06:04.487
I wouldn't miss it, you know, kinda thing.

06:04.687 --> 06:11.686
But lately I've just... been kinda curious
about how things have slacked off.

06:12.786 --> 06:16.286
Perhaps he senses
your hesitance at being touched.

06:17.186 --> 06:21.086
But that's the weird thing,
because he started not touching me

06:21.286 --> 06:23.786
before I started feelin' like that.

06:24.886 --> 06:26.886
Ah.

06:27.586 --> 06:32.085
I mean, I'm sure he probably wishes
that I would initiate things once in a while,

06:32.385 --> 06:37.185
and I would, ex cept for
it just never occurs to me, and...

06:38.485 --> 06:42.185
well, the few times
I have felt like it I was by myself.

06:44.085 --> 06:46.385
Did you do anything?

06:48.985 --> 06:51.185
What do you mean?

06:51.385 --> 06:53.284
Did you masturbate?

06:54.884 --> 06:56.384
Oh!

06:59.184 --> 07:01.584
Oh. Oh.

07:02.484 --> 07:04.484
God, no.

07:05.584 --> 07:07.684
No. Mm-mm.

07:07.884 --> 07:11.984
I take it from your response
that you never masturbate.

07:17.283 --> 07:21.083
Well... I tried once.

07:21.383 --> 07:23.783
It just seems so stupid!

07:25.783 --> 07:30.283
I don't know! It just seemed like
a dumb thing to do, and...

07:30.583 --> 07:36.283
God, and then I started worrying that my
dead grandfather was watching me, and...

07:38.783 --> 07:43.182
It seemed so stupid, especially when you
don't know what to do with the garbage.

07:43.582 --> 07:46.482
Oh, so it was recently
when you tried this?

07:48.082 --> 07:52.382
Oh, well, it was kind of recently,
but not... real recently.

07:56.782 --> 08:00.382
I am just not up to
havin' a guest in the house.

08:07.281 --> 08:11.781
I gotta go. I gotta go to the office.
I gotta get back to the office.

08:12.981 --> 08:16.281
I only get one today? Gee, how ex citing.

08:17.281 --> 08:20.481
I already skipped one meeting.
I gotta get back.

08:21.881 --> 08:26.181
Look, John, if you wanna leave, leave.

08:26.481 --> 08:31.380
My life doesn't revolve around these
little get-togethers. Don't flatter yourself.

08:34.580 --> 08:39.280
Don't feel like you gotta treat me with
kid gloves. Tell me how you really feel.

08:40.580 --> 08:46.280
Listen, I got a friend comin' into town,
an old friend I haven't seen in years.

08:47.780 --> 08:50.980
From what I can tell,
I think he's a little lost.

08:52.079 --> 08:55.079
I think I may have
to spend a little time with him.

08:55.379 --> 08:58.279
Mm-hm.
Meaning we'll have to cool it for a while?

09:00.679 --> 09:02.679
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

09:06.179 --> 09:08.679
I wish you'd quit
that bartending job of yours.

09:08.879 --> 09:10.579
Why?

09:10.779 --> 09:13.579
I hate the thought
of all those guys hittin' on you.

09:13.779 --> 09:17.078
I can handle it.

09:17.278 --> 09:18.978
I'm sure.

09:19.378 --> 09:23.578
Besides, the money is good,
and some of the guys are cute.

09:24.078 --> 09:26.478
And you are in no position to be jealous.

09:28.578 --> 09:30.678
Who said I was jealous?

09:30.978 --> 09:32.878
I did.

09:35.278 --> 09:40.077
You know, I'd like to do it
at your house sometime.

09:40.477 --> 09:45.777
I must admit, the idea of doin' it in my
sister's bed gives me a perverse thrill.

09:50.277 --> 09:55.877
I wish I could just come right out
and tell everyone Ann's a lousy lay.

09:56.277 --> 10:00.377
The beautiful, the popular
Ann Bishop Millaney.

10:03.176 --> 10:07.876
- Could be risky.
- How about I just start a rumour, then?

10:09.176 --> 10:13.676
- No, no, I mean doin' it at my house.
- Afraid of gettin' caught?

10:13.976 --> 10:15.376
Yeah!

10:15.876 --> 10:17.776
You should be.

10:19.576 --> 10:23.076
- Can I meet this friend of yours?
- Who, Graham?

10:23.476 --> 10:26.276
I gotta tell you, we were very close
many years ago, but I...

10:28.475 --> 10:30.875
I think we're very different now.

11:01.174 --> 11:03.874
- Yes?
- Ann? Uh, my name is Graham Dalton.

11:04.574 --> 11:06.874
- Oh! Yeah, sure.
- May I use your bathroom?

11:07.274 --> 11:09.374
Uh-huh. Come on in.

11:14.673 --> 11:17.873
- Where is it?
- Oh, back there to the left. I'm sorry.

11:18.173 --> 11:20.373
Do you like strawberries?
I brought you some.

11:20.573 --> 11:22.573
Thank you. That's real sweet.

11:40.672 --> 11:43.872
Hi. Um, John Millaney, please.
This is his wife.

11:48.372 --> 11:50.872
That's all right. Thank you.

11:54.772 --> 11:56.372
Well.

11:56.772 --> 11:58.672
- That was quick.
- False alarm.

11:58.972 --> 12:00.872
Have a seat.

12:05.271 --> 12:07.871
I'm sorry, we don't let people
smoke in the house.

12:08.171 --> 12:12.471
- But if you'd like to, we could go outside.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no. No, no. I...

12:12.671 --> 12:14.771
I can wait. I'm...

12:17.071 --> 12:19.671
- Do you have any other things?
- Yes.

12:20.671 --> 12:24.371
Oh, you mean to bring in? No.
I do have some other things, but I don't...

12:24.671 --> 12:26.970
This is all I need to stay here.

12:28.970 --> 12:31.470
Have you ever been on television?

12:33.170 --> 12:35.570
Television? No, no.

12:35.770 --> 12:37.170
Why?

12:38.670 --> 12:40.670
I was just curious.

12:44.170 --> 12:47.870
Graham. That's an unusual name.

12:48.270 --> 12:51.169
Yeah. Yeah, I, uh... I guess it is.

12:51.469 --> 12:55.169
My mother is a complete Anglophile.

12:56.469 --> 12:59.169
Anything British
makes her drool like a baby.

12:59.569 --> 13:02.969
So she, you know, I think she heard
the name in a movie or something.

13:03.269 --> 13:06.369
She's a prisoner of public television now.

13:06.669 --> 13:09.469
How do you like being married?

13:10.369 --> 13:12.668
I like it just fine.

13:12.868 --> 13:15.668
What about it do you like? I...

13:15.868 --> 13:20.268
- I don't mean to be critical. I'm curious.
- No, no, no, no. That's OK. Uh...

13:24.268 --> 13:28.768
Well... you know the cliche
about the security of it?

13:29.068 --> 13:31.068
Well, that's true.

13:32.368 --> 13:34.768
And, um, we own this house.

13:36.068 --> 13:38.867
It's a nice house. And...

13:40.367 --> 13:43.767
John was just made junior partner,
and I really like that.

13:44.967 --> 13:49.667
You know, I like the fact that he's just not,
you know, freelance or whatever.

13:49.967 --> 13:51.567
Yes.

13:55.767 --> 13:59.167
So, how long has it been
since you've seen John?

13:59.367 --> 14:00.766
- Nine years.
- Nine years?

14:00.966 --> 14:06.166
Yeah. I was surprised he invited me
to stay here until I found a place.

14:06.466 --> 14:11.066
- Didn't you know him very well?
- Oh, no, I knew him very well.

14:11.366 --> 14:13.966
John and I...

14:14.166 --> 14:16.366
were very much alike.

14:16.566 --> 14:17.566
Really?

14:20.266 --> 14:24.965
That's kinda hard to believe.
I mean, you just seem so different now.

14:26.765 --> 14:30.565
Yeah. Well, I would imagine
we are pretty different now.

14:31.565 --> 14:34.465
- I'm ready to use the bathroom, finally.
- OK.

14:50.364 --> 14:56.464
Graham. I gotta tell you, I almost
called the cops when I saw you today.

14:56.864 --> 15:01.664
I thought to myself
"This couldn't possibly be the same guy

15:02.064 --> 15:05.964
that once held private services in
the back of the chapel on a weekly basis".

15:06.364 --> 15:11.263
- You did that?
- Everybody has a past. That's mine, so...

15:11.563 --> 15:13.663
So, what's with the get-up?

15:14.663 --> 15:17.263
- Somebody die, or...?
- John!

15:17.463 --> 15:20.063
- I'm sorry. Did...? I'm sorry.
- No, no, no.

15:20.263 --> 15:22.163
Nobody died.

15:23.763 --> 15:25.763
- So...
- I mean...

15:25.963 --> 15:29.863
what do you think the Greeks'd
think of this rather sombre attire?

15:31.463 --> 15:33.363
I don't know.

15:34.363 --> 15:37.762
- Dinner was very good.
- Yeah, it wasn't bad, honey.

15:38.062 --> 15:43.662
Usually Ann achieves a kinda critical
mass with the salt, but, uh, tonight was...

15:43.962 --> 15:47.862
I always tell her, you can always
add more, but you can't take it away.

15:48.162 --> 15:50.762
Yeah, you say that, don't you?

15:51.762 --> 15:54.262
- So, do you have family here?
- Mm.

15:54.462 --> 15:56.862
Mother, father, my sister.

15:57.762 --> 16:00.461
- Sister older or younger?
- Younger.

16:03.061 --> 16:05.061
Are you close?

16:06.361 --> 16:09.261
I'm sorry. I'm... I'm prying again. I'm sorry.

16:09.661 --> 16:11.761
Were you prying before?

16:12.061 --> 16:14.261
I was grilling Ann about your marriage.

16:14.461 --> 16:17.761
- How'd it go?
- Well, I... Very well. Uh...

16:21.461 --> 16:24.060
So, I was asking about your sister.

16:24.460 --> 16:26.460
Yeah. Well...

16:27.560 --> 16:30.560
We get along all right, it's just that, uh...

16:32.260 --> 16:34.660
Well, I think she's an extrovert.

16:38.960 --> 16:42.660
I just think she's loud.
She probably wouldn't agree.

16:44.160 --> 16:46.759
No, I mean, definitely wouldn't agree.

16:48.859 --> 16:52.559
So, listen, are you gonna
see Elizabeth while you're here?

16:52.759 --> 16:54.459
Uh... I don't know.

16:56.359 --> 16:59.059
- Who's Elizabeth?
- A girl Graham dated in school.

16:59.359 --> 17:01.759
Well after the chapel episodes.

17:02.759 --> 17:06.159
She still lives here,
to the best of my knowledge.

17:09.558 --> 17:11.958
So Graham and I
were talking about apartments,

17:12.157 --> 17:16.458
and I told him that they've got lovely
little apartments in the Garden District.

17:16.858 --> 17:21.657
- And they got nice garage apartments...
- There's critical crime in that district.

17:21.958 --> 17:24.758
- Oh, John, come on, that is not true.
- No. There are...

17:25.157 --> 17:29.458
I don't know what kind of place you're
lookin' for. There's plenty of apartments...

17:29.658 --> 17:32.358
- ...in any one place.
- I'm sorry?

17:32.958 --> 17:39.157
No, I just... Right now I have one key,
you know, everything I own is in the car.

17:39.557 --> 17:42.557
I like that.
If I get an apartment, that's two keys.

17:42.857 --> 17:47.757
If I get a job, you know, I might have
to open or close. That's more keys.

17:48.057 --> 17:53.257
I buy some stuff, I'm afraid it's gonna
get ripped off, and I get more keys.

17:53.557 --> 17:57.956
- I just like having the one key. It's clean.
- You don't have to worry about losin' 'em.

17:58.356 --> 18:01.456
Get rid of the car when you get
the apartment. Still one key.

18:01.856 --> 18:06.756
I like having the car. You know?
The car's important. You gotta be mobile.

18:07.056 --> 18:09.856
In case you have
to leave someplace in a hurry?

18:10.156 --> 18:12.656
Yeah, or go someplace in a hurry.

18:14.456 --> 18:16.656
Ex cuse me.

18:21.455 --> 18:24.455
- Do you want some help?
- No, no, really, I'm fine.

18:24.755 --> 18:26.955
There's not that much to do.

18:30.355 --> 18:33.355
Graham, do you pay taxes?

18:34.255 --> 18:37.655
Yeah, I pay taxes.
Yeah, I pay taxes. What do you mean?

18:37.955 --> 18:41.155
You don't pay taxes, you're a liar.
I'm not a liar.

18:42.355 --> 18:45.754
Liars are the second-lowest form
of human being on the planet.

18:46.054 --> 18:48.554
- What's the first?
- Lawyers.

18:49.054 --> 18:51.154
Oh. That's you, honey.

18:55.754 --> 18:58.554
Annie, why don't you go with Graham
to hunt for apartments?

18:58.754 --> 19:00.954
Show him how the city's changed.

19:01.154 --> 19:03.354
- Would you mind, Graham?
- No, I'd love that.

19:03.654 --> 19:07.354
- I'd like that, too. Let's do that.
- All right. How about tomorrow?

19:07.654 --> 19:09.653
- That'd be great.
- Good.

19:12.153 --> 19:13.853
One key, huh?

19:15.253 --> 19:16.453
Great idea.

19:26.653 --> 19:29.053
- Yeah.
- Cynthia, John.

19:29.453 --> 19:32.052
Meet me at my house in exactly one hour.

19:32.352 --> 19:34.552
You are scum.

19:34.852 --> 19:36.752
I'll be there.

19:42.552 --> 19:45.552
As you can see,
there's plenty of room for two.

19:47.352 --> 19:49.552
No, it'll just be me.

19:49.752 --> 19:52.152
- Are you a student?
- No.

19:53.352 --> 19:56.151
You can hang
a shower curtain in the bath.

19:56.551 --> 19:59.251
Make sure you put somethin'
in the tub so you won't fall.

20:00.451 --> 20:02.351
You said about 350?

20:02.851 --> 20:06.851
Yeah. And, uh, plus
the first and the last months' rent.

20:11.151 --> 20:14.851
- All right. Will you lease month to month?
- Not for 350.

20:15.751 --> 20:17.651
How about 400?

20:23.450 --> 20:25.750
I could live with that. I could live with that.

20:25.950 --> 20:27.650
- OK. It's a deal.
- All right.

20:27.950 --> 20:29.850
- Ready?
- Yeah.

20:41.750 --> 20:43.649
- John?
- In here.

20:59.149 --> 21:01.549
Well, ain't you a picture?

21:28.948 --> 21:31.647
Well, do you like it?

21:34.047 --> 21:37.047
It's lovely. Is it for me?

21:39.747 --> 21:41.847
Yeah, it's for you.

22:05.046 --> 22:07.446
Is that for me?

22:07.646 --> 22:09.746
Yeah, that's for you.

22:31.445 --> 22:33.445
You're amazing, dear.

22:45.344 --> 22:48.044
Can I tell you something personal?

22:51.044 --> 22:53.444
It's up to you.
Can I tell you something personal?

22:53.644 --> 22:55.644
Yeah. Yeah.

22:59.744 --> 23:02.044
Well, you gotta go first.

23:02.544 --> 23:04.044
OK.

23:10.543 --> 23:12.943
I think that, um...

23:13.143 --> 23:15.443
I think that sex is overrated.

23:15.743 --> 23:19.043
I think that people place
far too much importance on it.

23:19.343 --> 23:23.343
And I think that stuff about women
wantin' it just as bad as men is crap.

23:23.643 --> 23:28.743
I think they want it, I just don't think they
want it for the reason men think they do.

23:30.842 --> 23:33.242
I'm getting confused.

23:33.442 --> 23:35.742
- Do you understand what I'm...?
- Yeah.

23:35.942 --> 23:38.542
Yeah. Yeah.

23:38.742 --> 23:42.742
Yeah, I remember reading somewhere

23:43.142 --> 23:48.342
that men learn to love
the person that they're attracted to,

23:49.642 --> 23:54.841
and that women become more and more
attracted to the person that they love.

23:57.141 --> 24:00.041
God, that's... that's beautiful.

24:01.141 --> 24:04.841
That's really beautiful. I like that.

24:05.141 --> 24:07.141
Oh, I'm just quoting.

24:08.641 --> 24:11.041
So, are you gonna
tell me something personal?

24:11.341 --> 24:14.041
- Do you want me to?
- Yeah. Yeah, I do.

24:14.241 --> 24:17.140
I don't want it to be
something gross, about some scar.

24:17.440 --> 24:20.640
I want it to be something
really personal, about yourself.

24:20.940 --> 24:22.940
All right. OK.

24:23.440 --> 24:26.140
- I'm impotent.
- You're what?

24:27.440 --> 24:30.740
- lmpotent.
- You are?

24:32.340 --> 24:35.440
Yeah. I mean, like, well, I can't...

24:36.240 --> 24:40.739
I can't get an erection...
in the presence of another person.

24:43.239 --> 24:46.139
So, for all practical purposes,
I'm impotent.

24:50.139 --> 24:52.239
Does that bother you?

24:54.139 --> 24:55.639
No.

24:57.339 --> 25:00.039
Does it make you feel self-conscious?

25:10.338 --> 25:12.338
Not usually.

25:13.938 --> 25:15.738
No. Uh...

25:16.038 --> 25:18.138
Yeah, I'm self-conscious.

25:19.338 --> 25:22.638
Not in the same way
that you are, though.

25:23.138 --> 25:26.538
- Me? Me? You think I'm self-conscious?
- Well...

25:29.137 --> 25:33.737
I been watching you. I watch you eat,
you know, I watch you speak,

25:35.437 --> 25:39.537
watch you move, and I see somebody

25:39.837 --> 25:44.237
who is extremely aware
of people looking at you.

25:48.037 --> 25:50.637
- My therapist...
- You're in therapy?

25:50.937 --> 25:52.936
Aren't you?

25:53.536 --> 25:56.036
No. I... No, I'm not.

25:58.436 --> 26:01.036
I was a miserable failure in therapy.

26:01.936 --> 26:06.936
- So you don't believe in therapy?
- No, I believe in it for some people.

26:07.936 --> 26:10.936
I don't know, it was,
you know, silly for me.

26:11.936 --> 26:14.036
I was confused going in.

26:15.935 --> 26:18.235
So I just formed my own theory

26:18.435 --> 26:21.135
that you should never take advice

26:21.435 --> 26:24.635
from someone
that doesn't know you intimately.

26:25.635 --> 26:28.935
Well, I know my therapist intimately.

26:31.835 --> 26:35.135
- You've had sex with your therapist?
- No!

26:35.335 --> 26:39.334
- No. No.
- Oh, no, I'm sorry. That's what I meant.

26:39.634 --> 26:42.334
Somebody you've had sex with.

26:42.534 --> 26:44.134
Oh.

26:49.934 --> 26:52.934
I'm... I don't understand.

26:53.234 --> 26:56.834
I mean, how would you know?

26:58.234 --> 27:02.933
- I mean, you know. How...?
- Oh, no. I wasn't always impotent.

27:03.833 --> 27:06.333
Oh. Oh, OK.

27:08.233 --> 27:11.633
So, let me see. You said, um...

27:12.333 --> 27:15.633
you said that I should never take advice

27:16.033 --> 27:19.533
from someone that
I haven't had sex with, right?

27:20.033 --> 27:21.733
- Basically.
- Right.

27:21.833 --> 27:24.333
And, uh, we haven't had sex.

27:25.633 --> 27:27.532
- Right?
- No.

27:28.332 --> 27:32.932
So I guess from your own advice,
I shouldn't take your advice.

27:33.832 --> 27:36.432
- I wouldn't.
- You wouldn't? OK.

27:39.232 --> 27:41.232
All right.

27:43.232 --> 27:45.532
- Drive safely.
- Yeah, right.

29:11.028 --> 29:14.128
- How was your weekend?
- It was OK.

29:17.228 --> 29:21.828
- Did you confront John about the visitor?
- The visitor?

29:22.128 --> 29:25.127
The friend of John's
that was staying at your house.

29:25.427 --> 29:27.727
- Graham.
- Graham.

29:28.027 --> 29:32.227
Yeah. I mean... no.

29:32.527 --> 29:35.527
That actually
turned out to be interesting.

29:38.327 --> 29:41.627
You know, I was expecting him
to be just like John.

29:41.927 --> 29:45.427
You know, cos they went
to school together and everything.

29:45.627 --> 29:51.126
You know, talking about getting drunk
together and secret handshakes and...

29:56.726 --> 30:01.526
He turned out to be
really this... character.

30:04.026 --> 30:06.826
He's kind of arty.

30:07.026 --> 30:09.026
But OK.

30:09.226 --> 30:11.626
Is he still at your house?

30:11.926 --> 30:15.025
No. No. No. He's gone.

30:17.325 --> 30:19.825
So where's he from?

30:20.125 --> 30:25.325
I don't know. He, uh, used to live
in New York and Philadelphia.

30:26.525 --> 30:28.725
I think he just kinda travels around.

30:29.025 --> 30:32.725
Must be nice.
So, what's he like? Is he like John?

30:33.025 --> 30:36.524
No. I don't think John likes him any more.

30:38.424 --> 30:40.924
Says he thinks he's gotten kinda strange.

30:41.224 --> 30:43.224
Is he? Strange, I mean?

30:44.224 --> 30:48.324
No. I mean, if I saw him
on the street I might think so,

30:48.724 --> 30:51.924
but after talkin' to him,
I'd just say he's kinda unusual.

30:52.224 --> 30:55.824
Mm-hm. So, what's he look like?

30:56.024 --> 30:57.924
Why?

30:58.224 --> 31:01.323
- I just wanna know, is all.
- Why, so you can go after him?

31:01.623 --> 31:04.623
Jesus, Ann, get a life.
I just asked what he looked like.

31:05.623 --> 31:10.823
Besides, even if I decide
to fuck his brains out,

31:11.123 --> 31:13.423
what business is that of yours?

31:13.623 --> 31:16.023
- Why do you have to say that?
- Say what?

31:16.223 --> 31:18.723
You know what.
You say it just to irritate me.

31:19.123 --> 31:21.623
I say it because it's descriptive.

31:22.923 --> 31:26.422
He doesn't strike me as a person
who would go in for that kinda thing.

31:26.822 --> 31:30.222
- Ann, you always underestimate me.
- I wonder why.

31:33.622 --> 31:38.222
I think you're afraid to put us in the same
room. You're afraid he'd be drawn to me.

31:38.522 --> 31:41.622
Really, Cynthia,
I don't think he's your type.

31:45.122 --> 31:48.121
My type?
How would you know what my type is?

31:48.421 --> 31:50.921
Oh, I have a pretty good idea.

31:52.621 --> 31:54.821
Ann, you don't have a clue.

31:55.821 --> 31:58.621
Look, I don't even know
why we're discussin' this.

31:58.821 --> 32:01.821
I mean, I'll just go over
and call him myself.

32:02.921 --> 32:05.721
He doesn't have a phone.

32:05.921 --> 32:08.321
Well, I'll call him when he does.

32:09.621 --> 32:11.620
He won't.

32:11.820 --> 32:13.820
What are you talkin' about?

32:14.120 --> 32:17.220
He doesn't like to talk on the phone.
He's not getting a phone.

32:17.520 --> 32:19.520
Oh, please.

32:20.620 --> 32:24.420
OK, so give me the Zen master's address.
I'll think of a reason to stop by.

32:26.520 --> 32:29.120
Please, just let me talk to him first.

32:29.320 --> 32:33.420
Why? Just gimme the address.
You won't even have to be involved.

32:44.819 --> 32:49.119
I don't feel right just giving you the
address so you can go over there and...

32:49.519 --> 32:52.719
- And what?
- Do whatever it is you do.

32:52.919 --> 32:55.719
"Do whatever it is you do"?
Listen to the way you talk.

32:56.019 --> 33:00.118
- I talk fine.
- Thank you, I was still smoking that.

33:02.218 --> 33:04.418
What'd you lose?

33:04.718 --> 33:07.618
That goddamn pearl earring.

33:09.318 --> 33:11.818
It cost me a fucking fortune.

33:12.018 --> 33:14.118
I must've left it somewhere.

33:15.918 --> 33:18.918
So, what are you
gettin' Momma for her birthday?

33:19.218 --> 33:21.518
I don't know.
I'll get her a card or somethin'.

33:21.817 --> 33:25.017
- A card for her 50th birthday?
- Yeah, what's wrong with that?

33:25.217 --> 33:28.917
Well, the woman gave birth to you.
I think you might be givin' her...

33:29.217 --> 33:31.217
Will you stop? Jesus.

33:31.517 --> 33:34.817
- I just thought that, you know, maybe...
- OK, Ann. OK.

33:35.817 --> 33:37.817
How about this?

33:38.117 --> 33:42.517
You get her something nice,
and I'll pay for half.

33:42.817 --> 33:45.417
- All right?
- Fine. Fine.

33:46.216 --> 33:50.216
Fine. OK. Now, if you'll pardon me,
I have to go to work.

33:57.016 --> 34:02.316
What is the most unusual
location you've ever masturbated in?

34:04.416 --> 34:05.916
Well...

34:07.416 --> 34:08.815
l, um...

34:09.016 --> 34:14.915
One time I was flying from
Los Angeles to, um, to New York.

34:17.014 --> 34:21.715
And I was... You know,
it was a really crowded flight and I was...

34:22.815 --> 34:26.915
I was sitting in the middle.
I didn't get a window, I didn't get an aisle.

34:27.215 --> 34:30.514
It was really funny,
and I was... I was just bored.

34:30.715 --> 34:34.914
My magazines were just boring.
I think I had, like, a woman's magazine.

34:35.214 --> 34:39.813
And they touch on a lot of sexual issues
and stuff. And I was thinking to myself

34:40.214 --> 34:46.214
"God, that's what I need. I need a little...
something to take my mind off this trip."

34:46.914 --> 34:52.514
So, I was just, you know,
just thinking away, and then I just...

34:53.414 --> 34:56.414
I just did it on the plane.
Just between these two people.

34:56.612 --> 34:58.713
- Nobody knew.

35:02.813 --> 35:06.713
How were you able
to not betray what was going on

35:07.113 --> 35:09.213
to the people around you?

35:10.513 --> 35:15.113
Well, you know,
I have really strong muscles.

35:16.513 --> 35:18.513
It's open!

35:19.213 --> 35:22.012
- Hi!
- Hello, Ann.

35:22.212 --> 35:24.712
- I hope I'm not botherin' you.
- No, no.

35:24.912 --> 35:29.612
- I would've phoned. You busy?
- No, no. I can finish later.

35:30.012 --> 35:33.812
I just wanted to see what
the apartment looked like with furniture.

35:34.112 --> 35:37.212
Yeah, well, I'm afraid
there's not much to see.

35:37.512 --> 35:41.412
I'm sort of cultivating
this minimalist vibe.

35:42.912 --> 35:46.411
- You could use a bookshelf.
- Yeah? Yeah, you think so?

35:47.911 --> 35:51.411
They're... you know,
they're all library books.

35:55.011 --> 35:58.411
- What are these?
- Uh, those are videotapes.

35:58.611 --> 36:01.411
I can see that. Of what?

36:02.911 --> 36:06.911
It's a personal project
I've been workin' on.

36:07.311 --> 36:09.810
What kind of personal project?

36:11.610 --> 36:14.510
- What?
- What kind of personal project?

36:17.110 --> 36:22.010
Uh, a personal project
like anyone else's personal project.

36:22.310 --> 36:25.810
Mine's just a little more...
personal, I guess.

36:27.710 --> 36:30.010
Who's Donna?

36:30.310 --> 36:33.709
- What?
- Donna. It says "Donna" here on the tape.

36:34.009 --> 36:37.709
Donna was a girl I knew in Florida.

36:38.009 --> 36:40.209
Oh, you went out with her?

36:42.509 --> 36:44.809
No, not really.

36:45.009 --> 36:48.709
Why do these tapes
all have women's names on 'em?

36:51.709 --> 36:54.509
Well, I enjoy interviewing
women more than men.

36:56.908 --> 36:59.308
- It's iced tea.
- Thanks.

36:59.608 --> 37:03.308
- I'm sorry, do you want some lemon?
- No, this is perfect.

37:03.608 --> 37:07.308
So, all of these are... are interviews, huh?

37:07.608 --> 37:10.208
- Uh, yes.
- Can we watch one?

37:12.408 --> 37:14.508
No, I'd... No.

37:14.608 --> 37:16.608
Why not?

37:18.608 --> 37:21.507
Well, I promised each of the subjects

37:21.707 --> 37:25.207
that no one would
see the videotapes ex cept for me.

37:27.907 --> 37:30.507
What are the interviews about?

37:32.007 --> 37:34.807
The interviews are about sex.

37:37.007 --> 37:38.607
Sex?

37:41.207 --> 37:42.806
What about sex?

37:46.206 --> 37:49.006
Uh, everything about sex.

37:50.506 --> 37:52.106
Like what?

37:54.606 --> 37:57.406
What they've done, what they do,

37:58.206 --> 38:03.106
what they want to do but are afraid to ask
for, what they wouldn't do even if asked.

38:05.706 --> 38:08.205
Anything I can think of. Oh, your ice.

38:13.605 --> 38:17.005
- You just ask them questions?
- Yes.

38:20.205 --> 38:22.405
And they answer 'em?

38:22.605 --> 38:25.105
Yeah. Uh...

38:25.305 --> 38:27.605
Mostly. Sometimes they do things.

38:28.005 --> 38:32.904
- To you?
- No, uh... for the camera.

38:34.604 --> 38:38.204
- Graham, this is just so...
- I'm sorry this came up.

38:38.604 --> 38:42.904
No, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry this came up, and...

38:43.204 --> 38:46.804
- I'm... I'm gonna go.
- Here, I'll take it.

38:47.004 --> 38:48.904
- OK. Yeah. All right.
- Bye.

39:00.703 --> 39:02.703
He doesn't want you to come over.

39:02.903 --> 39:05.403
What do you mean?
Did you tell him about me?

39:05.603 --> 39:07.903
- No, I didn't.
- Why not?

39:08.203 --> 39:11.403
- Look, Cynthia, I didn't have time.
- Well, why?

39:12.503 --> 39:16.103
John's right. He's strange and you
don't wanna get involved with him.

39:16.303 --> 39:18.102
What happened over there?

39:18.302 --> 39:20.402
- Did he make a pass at you?
- No.

39:20.702 --> 39:24.802
Well, what's this "strange" bullshit
all of a sudden? Is he drownin' puppies?

39:25.202 --> 39:27.302
It's nothin' like that, OK?

39:27.502 --> 39:31.902
- Well, what? Is he dangerous?
- No. Not physically.

39:32.202 --> 39:36.802
- Well, what, then?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

39:37.202 --> 39:39.402
- Then why did you call me?
- I don't know.

39:50.001 --> 39:52.301
- Hello?
- Cynthia, John.

39:52.501 --> 39:55.601
Not today. I've got other plans.

39:56.801 --> 39:59.301
Oh. Well, when, then?

40:00.901 --> 40:03.301
How about inviting me over to dinner?

40:03.501 --> 40:06.900
- You know what I mean.
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

40:13.400 --> 40:16.500
- It's open.

40:21.200 --> 40:23.300
- Hi.
- Hello.

40:28.000 --> 40:30.699
- Can I help you?
- I'm Cynthia Bishop.

40:31.999 --> 40:35.399
- Do I know you? I don't...
- I'm Ann Millaney's sister.

40:36.299 --> 40:37.999
The extrovert.

40:38.199 --> 40:41.599
She must have been in a good mood.
She usually calls me loud.

40:41.899 --> 40:44.299
Yeah, she called you that, too.

40:45.999 --> 40:48.999
So, uh, what are you doin' here?

40:49.599 --> 40:53.298
- You want me to leave?
- No, I just wanna know why you're here.

40:53.498 --> 40:59.298
Well, like I said, Ann is my sister.
Sisters talk. You can imagine the rest.

41:01.598 --> 41:06.098
No, I think it's probably better
if I don't characterise that conversation

41:06.498 --> 41:08.498
that I didn't hear.

41:09.698 --> 41:16.397
I don't have any idea, really, what you
or Ann said about me or anything else.

41:19.697 --> 41:22.397
- Do you want some iced tea?
- Sure.

41:22.897 --> 41:25.297
I don't have any lemons.

41:25.497 --> 41:31.997
The last time I saw Ann she left here
very confused, I'd say, and upset.

41:32.497 --> 41:34.297
She still is.

41:36.297 --> 41:40.796
So, are you here to make me feel bad
for makin' her feel bad?

41:43.196 --> 41:44.696
No.

41:48.396 --> 41:51.296
- She didn't tell you why she was upset?
- No.

41:58.496 --> 41:59.996
Thanks.

42:04.995 --> 42:09.795
So, I don't understand
what made you wanna come here.

42:10.195 --> 42:14.695
I can't imagine Ann painted
a very flattering portrait of me.

42:15.095 --> 42:19.295
Yeah, well, see, um, I don't really
listen to Ann when it comes to men.

42:19.695 --> 42:23.595
I mean, look at John, for Christ's sake.

42:23.895 --> 42:26.495
But then, you went to school
with him, didn't you?

42:26.695 --> 42:28.994
You're probably friends or somethin'.

42:29.394 --> 42:30.894
No.

42:33.094 --> 42:35.394
No, I think John is a liar.

42:38.794 --> 42:40.894
I think you're right.

42:42.694 --> 42:47.694
So come on, I came all the way over here
to find out what got Ann so spooked.

42:48.094 --> 42:50.993
Why don't you tell me what happened?

42:51.393 --> 42:57.193
"Spooked"? The videotapes
are what got Ann so spooked.

43:13.793 --> 43:15.292
Oh.

43:16.092 --> 43:17.992
I think I get it.

43:18.292 --> 43:20.792
Oh, yeah? What do you get?

43:20.992 --> 43:24.392
If Ann got freaked out by these,
they must be somethin' sexual.

43:24.692 --> 43:27.292
Are these tapes of you
havin' sex with these girls?

43:27.592 --> 43:31.892
- No, not exactly.
- Either you are or you aren't. Which is it?

43:32.192 --> 43:37.192
- Why don't you let me tape you?
- Doin' what?

43:37.592 --> 43:39.591
- Talking.
- About what?

43:40.491 --> 43:44.691
About sex. Your sexual history,
sexual preferences.

43:48.591 --> 43:51.091
- What makes you think I'd discuss that?
- Nothing.

43:56.791 --> 44:01.491
- And you just wanna ask me questions?
- I just wanna ask you questions.

44:01.791 --> 44:03.790
- That's all?
- That's all.

44:08.090 --> 44:13.090
Is this how you get off? Tapin' women
talkin' about their sexual experiences?

44:13.390 --> 44:16.290
- Yes.
- Would anyone else see the tape?

44:16.590 --> 44:20.490
Absolutely not. Nobody else
sees the tapes ex cept for me.

44:21.290 --> 44:23.390
How long will it take?

44:25.190 --> 44:29.589
Well, that depends on you.
One woman used up only three minutes.

44:30.589 --> 44:32.989
And another used three two-hour tapes.

44:36.189 --> 44:38.289
How do we start?

44:38.589 --> 44:41.489
I turn on the camera and you start talking.

44:43.689 --> 44:45.689
Do I sit or stand?

44:45.889 --> 44:48.889
- What do you prefer?
- I'd prefer to sit.

44:57.088 --> 44:59.088
Are you ready?

45:06.088 --> 45:08.388
OK, I'm recording.

45:08.588 --> 45:12.988
- So tell me your name.
- Cynthia... Patrice... Bishop.

45:13.287 --> 45:15.887
- You can speak in a normal voice.
- OK.

45:17.887 --> 45:20.987
So, describe for me
your first sexual experience.

45:24.687 --> 45:26.887
Um...

45:27.087 --> 45:29.887
First sexual experience
or first time I had intercourse?

45:30.187 --> 45:33.787
- First sexual experience.
- Sexual experience.

45:40.786 --> 45:44.586
I was... uh... eight.

45:46.286 --> 45:50.286
And, uh...
Is this the kinda thing that...? Yeah, OK.

45:52.286 --> 45:58.186
I was eight years old, and, um,
Michael Green, who was also eight,

45:59.386 --> 46:01.885
asked if he could watch me take a pee.

46:02.085 --> 46:05.985
And I said he could
if I could watch him take one, too.

46:06.385 --> 46:09.985
So we went to the woods
behind my house.

46:10.985 --> 46:16.285
And I got this feeling he was chickenin'
out cos he kept sayin' "Ladies first!"

46:16.685 --> 46:21.785
So I pulled down
my little panties and urinated,

46:22.085 --> 46:25.084
and he ran away before I even finished.

46:26.984 --> 46:29.884
Was it a topic of conversation
between you after that?

46:30.184 --> 46:33.084
No! He kind of avoided me
for the rest of the summer,

46:33.384 --> 46:35.984
and then his family moved away.

46:37.284 --> 46:39.884
To Cleveland, actually.

46:40.084 --> 46:42.084
What a shame.

46:43.984 --> 46:46.584
When did you finally see a penis?

46:47.983 --> 46:49.983
When I was 14.

46:51.583 --> 46:53.983
So, what'd you think?

46:54.183 --> 46:57.583
Was it what you expected it to be?

47:02.683 --> 47:05.783
No. Not really. I...

47:09.483 --> 47:12.282
I didn't... I sorta pictured it, um...

47:15.782 --> 47:19.982
I didn't think it would have
veins or ridges or anything.

47:20.282 --> 47:23.582
I just thought it would be smooth,
like a test tube.

47:25.182 --> 47:27.882
It's weird, thinking about it now.

47:32.582 --> 47:40.081
The... organ itself seemed like
a separate thing, a separate entity to me.

47:40.581 --> 47:45.281
I mean, when he finally pulled it out
and I could look at it and touch it,

47:45.581 --> 47:48.081
I forgot that there was a guy attached to it.

47:48.281 --> 47:51.981
I remember literally being startled
when the guy spoke to me.

47:52.981 --> 47:56.381
- What did he say?
- He said my hand felt good.

48:00.480 --> 48:02.580
Then what happened?

48:04.680 --> 48:06.780
And...

48:06.980 --> 48:12.080
Then I started movin' my hand,
and then he stopped talkin'.

48:35.179 --> 48:37.179
- Yeah?
- John, Cynthia.

48:38.879 --> 48:42.379
- How'd you get through?
- I told Janet I was Ann.

48:42.679 --> 48:44.679
Ah. She bought it?

48:44.879 --> 48:47.078
Well, obviously.

48:47.378 --> 48:51.378
Look... I want to see you.

48:52.278 --> 48:54.778
- Ah. When?
- Right now.

48:54.978 --> 48:57.478
I don't know if I can do that.
I got a client waiting.

48:57.678 --> 49:03.178
I've already rescheduled him once.
I'd have to do some heavy-duty juggling.

49:03.478 --> 49:06.578
Then get those balls in the air
and get your butt over here.

49:26.677 --> 49:28.777
- Yes, sir?
- Janet.

49:29.877 --> 49:33.077
Listen, I want you to reschedule Kirkland.
I know, I know.

49:33.277 --> 49:36.076
See if he can come in Monday, any time.

49:36.476 --> 49:38.876
Tell him, uh... Tell him, uh...

49:40.176 --> 49:42.876
- Family crisis. Family crisis.
- OK.

49:43.076 --> 49:45.076
- I'll slip out the back.
- Yes, sir.

49:45.276 --> 49:47.276
All right. Bye.

49:51.076 --> 49:54.176
Would you like me to take my skirt off?

49:58.675 --> 50:00.675
If you wish.

50:22.074 --> 50:24.574
You're not wearing any underwear.

50:29.774 --> 50:32.174
Do you like the way I look?

50:33.474 --> 50:35.374
Yes.

50:38.674 --> 50:40.974
Do you think I'm pretty?

50:42.074 --> 50:43.574
Yes.

50:48.073 --> 50:50.073
Prettier than Ann?

50:51.273 --> 50:53.173
Different.

50:58.573 --> 51:01.173
John and Ann don't have sex any more.

51:06.973 --> 51:09.272
Is that what he tells you?

51:09.472 --> 51:11.772
He doesn't have to tell me.

51:24.772 --> 51:26.872
You're on fire today.

51:34.871 --> 51:36.471
Yes.

51:39.871 --> 51:41.771
You can go now.

51:49.671 --> 51:51.971
What kind of questions?

51:52.171 --> 51:55.871
Questions... about... sex.

51:58.470 --> 52:01.270
Well, what did he ask, exactly?

52:01.570 --> 52:04.670
Well, I don't wanna tell you, exactly.

52:06.970 --> 52:11.670
You let a total stranger record your sexual
life, but you won't tell your own sister?

52:12.070 --> 52:16.370
- Apparently.
- Did he ask you to take your clothes off?

52:19.370 --> 52:22.369
Did he ask me to take my clothes off?
No, he didn't.

52:22.669 --> 52:24.569
- Did you take your clothes off?
- Yes.

52:24.769 --> 52:27.069
- Cynthia!
- What?

52:27.269 --> 52:29.269
- Why did you do that?
- Because I wanted to.

52:29.569 --> 52:32.569
- But why did you want to?
- Because I wanted him to see me.

52:32.769 --> 52:36.069
You're crazy. He could be
bouncin' it off some satellite.

52:36.469 --> 52:40.969
- Some horny old men could be watchin'.
- Ann! He wouldn't do that.

52:41.369 --> 52:45.368
- You don't know that for sure.
- Well, it's too late now, isn't it?

52:47.168 --> 52:49.968
- Did he touch you?
- No.

52:51.868 --> 52:54.368
- Did you touch him?
- No.

52:59.368 --> 53:01.668
Did anybody touch anybody?

53:03.268 --> 53:05.468
Well, yes.

53:07.667 --> 53:10.067
Don't tell me.

53:10.367 --> 53:13.667
Don't tell me. Don't tell me. You didn't.

53:14.067 --> 53:16.167
- I did.
- You didn't.

53:16.467 --> 53:19.967
- I did!
- Oh, my God. Cynthia!

53:23.167 --> 53:25.567
You're in trouble.

53:25.867 --> 53:29.967
Listen to you. You sound like Momma.
What are you talkin' about?

53:31.766 --> 53:33.666
God, Cynthia.

53:33.866 --> 53:37.466
- I couldn't do that in front of John.
- You couldn't do it, period.

53:37.866 --> 53:41.166
- I mean, you don't even know him.
- I feel like I do.

53:41.366 --> 53:43.966
You don't.
You can't trust him. He's perverted.

53:44.866 --> 53:47.266
I don't understand why
this freaks you out so much.

53:47.466 --> 53:51.266
You didn't do it, I did, and if it doesn't
bother me, why should it bother you?

53:52.866 --> 53:56.065
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- OK, then, don't.

54:15.565 --> 54:17.965
Are... are you an assassin?

54:18.964 --> 54:22.464
- Ex cuse me?
- You're just an errand boy,

54:22.664 --> 54:25.464
sent by the grocer to collect the bill.

54:31.064 --> 54:34.564
It's my Brando. That's pretty good,
isn't it? Marlon Brando.

54:34.864 --> 54:37.164
It's great. Pardon me.

54:37.364 --> 54:42.064
OK. I was thinkin' we needed time apart.
Maybe you should be there for a while.

54:43.563 --> 54:47.563
Hi. So, why don't you get
an answering machine?

54:47.863 --> 54:50.563
- There's a phone here.
- It's busy.

54:51.263 --> 54:53.663
Well, why don't you keep tryin'?

54:55.463 --> 54:57.063
OK.

54:59.263 --> 55:01.963
- Well, here it is.
- What is it?

55:02.163 --> 55:05.163
- It's a sundress.
- Looks like a tablecloth.

55:06.262 --> 55:08.662
- It does not.
- Why would she want a sundress?

55:08.862 --> 55:11.562
She's got spots on her shoulders
and varicose veins.

55:11.762 --> 55:16.362
- Well, missy thing, so will you someday.
- When I do, I won't wear sundresses.

55:18.262 --> 55:20.462
- God, Cynthia...
- Hold on.

55:33.461 --> 55:35.461
- Bayou.
- Cynthia, John.

55:35.661 --> 55:39.361
- Would you like to speak with your wife?
- What's she doin' there?

55:39.661 --> 55:42.961
Showing me a present
she and I are buying your mother-in-law.

55:43.261 --> 55:47.561
Oh. Great. So, when can I see you?

55:47.861 --> 55:52.261
I don't know. I'm not sure I can
duplicate the intensity I had the other day.

55:52.661 --> 55:54.760
Nothin' wrong with trying.

55:55.060 --> 55:57.560
I don't think my sister would agree.

55:57.760 --> 56:00.760
Do you want me to stop calling?

56:00.960 --> 56:03.460
- Look, I'll call you. OK?
- Roger.

56:06.960 --> 56:12.360
This is too much. I'm wearing red, you're
wearing red. That's quite a coincidence...

56:12.660 --> 56:15.360
- Look, I'm married.
- Really?

56:15.560 --> 56:17.559
Are you very married?

56:17.859 --> 56:20.459
- Married enough.
- Oh. Oh.

56:20.759 --> 56:24.559
- I see. Well, that shouldn't stop us...
- I'm just here to see my sister. OK?

56:24.859 --> 56:28.059
Oh, really?
Who's your sister? Is she married?

56:30.059 --> 56:32.559
So, um, what's my share of the dress?

56:32.959 --> 56:35.459
- 32.50.
- It's a nice dress.

56:35.659 --> 56:38.359
- Thanks. I thought so, too.
- Looks like a tablecloth.

56:38.659 --> 56:43.058
Keep the change. And, Ann, don't worry
about the dress. I'm sure she'll like it.

56:45.158 --> 56:48.558
Yeah. I think it'll...
Oh, you have to go? OK. Goodbye.

56:48.758 --> 56:51.158
I'll see you later. I'll call you!

56:52.058 --> 56:53.458
Bye.

57:17.257 --> 57:18.857
John?

57:19.857 --> 57:21.457
Mm?

57:23.557 --> 57:25.457
- John?

57:27.457 --> 57:32.056
I called you last Monday at 3.30
and they said you weren't in.

57:33.656 --> 57:36.056
Do you remember where you were?

57:37.556 --> 57:38.856
On Monday?

57:40.056 --> 57:42.656
Uh... Last Monday?

57:43.956 --> 57:45.956
Oh, I had a late lunch.

57:48.056 --> 57:50.456
So, who'd you have lunch with?

57:54.955 --> 57:57.155
I ate by myself.

57:58.955 --> 58:00.955
Come on.

58:08.155 --> 58:12.255
- Is there somethin' wrong?
- Are you havin' an affair?

58:16.254 --> 58:18.154
Jesus Christ!

58:20.354 --> 58:23.854
I have a late lunch by myself
and now I'm fuckin' somebody?

58:24.154 --> 58:26.354
- Well, are you?
- No, I'm not.

58:27.454 --> 58:30.754
God, I'm offended
at the accusation. Come on.

58:34.454 --> 58:36.754
If I'm right, I wanna know.

58:37.054 --> 58:41.053
I don't want you to lie. I'd be upset,
but I'd be more upset if you lied to me.

58:43.853 --> 58:46.053
Well, there's nothin' to know.

58:48.953 --> 58:52.253
I can't tell you
how upset I'll be if you lie to me.

58:58.053 --> 58:59.953
This is paranoia.

59:02.853 --> 59:07.152
I mean... if anybody
should be paranoid, I should be.

59:09.352 --> 59:13.752
Here, every time I try to touch you,
you act as if I'm dipped in shit.

59:15.752 --> 59:19.152
I think there are a lot of women
out there that'd be glad to have

59:19.552 --> 59:22.952
a young, straight male
makin' a pretty good living

59:24.352 --> 59:27.451
beside 'em in bed with a... with a hard-on.

59:27.651 --> 59:29.951
- My sister, for one.
- For God's sake, Ann.

59:30.251 --> 59:33.551
- Is that who it is?
- Ann, I'm not fucking your sister.

59:33.951 --> 59:36.951
I don't find her that attractive,
for one thing.

59:37.151 --> 59:40.051
- Is that supposed to comfort me?
- No, I'm just saying.

59:40.351 --> 59:45.151
I'm just saying I didn't get paranoid
when you didn't wanna make love to me.

59:45.551 --> 59:50.850
I could have assumed that you didn't want
to because you were having an affair.

59:51.450 --> 59:54.150
- I'm not.
- Well, I'm not either. Now, come on.

59:54.350 --> 59:58.450
- Then why don't I believe you?
- Oh, look. This is ridiculous.

59:58.750 --> 01:00:01.550
- Maybe when you have evidence...
- There's evidence?

01:00:01.850 --> 01:00:06.350
That's not what I'm saying. I'm just
saying that we shouldn't not ever talk,

01:00:06.650 --> 01:00:09.450
just don't give me
conjecture and intuition.

01:00:10.250 --> 01:00:12.250
- Always a lawyer.
- Goddamn right.

01:00:12.550 --> 01:00:16.349
I mean, can you imagine? "Your Honour,
I'm positive the man is guilty."

01:00:16.649 --> 01:00:19.149
- "I can't place him at the scene..."
- All right.

01:00:19.449 --> 01:00:23.149
- "But I have this strong feeling..."
- All right. You made your point. OK.

01:00:23.449 --> 01:00:25.449
All right.

01:00:29.349 --> 01:00:31.249
I'm sorry.

01:00:32.149 --> 01:00:34.049
I'm sorry.

01:00:35.349 --> 01:00:39.448
I'm just under a lot of pressure
with this... this Kirkland thing.

01:00:40.448 --> 01:00:44.148
I mean, you know
it's my first big case as junior partner.

01:00:45.948 --> 01:00:48.948
I work all day and I come home.

01:00:49.248 --> 01:00:51.748
I look forward to seeing you.

01:00:55.948 --> 01:00:59.348
It hurts that you'd accuse me like that.

01:01:00.848 --> 01:01:02.747
I'm sorry.

01:01:04.647 --> 01:01:06.947
What? Come on.

01:01:09.447 --> 01:01:13.647
I've just got all this time
on my hands, and I just sit around

01:01:13.947 --> 01:01:18.247
and start inventing these,
like, intricate scenarios.

01:01:20.047 --> 01:01:24.747
And then I don't want to have wasted
all my time, so I wanna believe 'em.

01:01:27.846 --> 01:01:31.546
- Isn't therapy helpin' at all?
- Oh, John, I don't know.

01:01:31.746 --> 01:01:35.046
I just feel so stupid sittin'
talkin' about my little problems

01:01:35.346 --> 01:01:38.446
when I know
those poor children are starving.

01:01:39.046 --> 01:01:40.646
Well...

01:01:44.446 --> 01:01:49.945
Quitting your therapy's not gonna...
not gonna feed the children in Ethiopia.

01:01:51.445 --> 01:01:53.445
I know.

01:01:58.445 --> 01:02:01.145
You never used to say the word "fucking".

01:02:04.045 --> 01:02:05.545
Fuck.

01:02:08.645 --> 01:02:11.545
It's so stupid, I have a hard time
believing you did it.

01:02:11.945 --> 01:02:14.444
- What's so stupid about it?
- Well, you...

01:02:16.244 --> 01:02:19.644
- You don't even know the guy.
- Well, you know him.

01:02:20.044 --> 01:02:23.844
He's a friend of yours.
Do you think he can be trusted?

01:02:24.244 --> 01:02:25.644
I don't know.

01:02:27.544 --> 01:02:31.644
I don't know.
From what you've told me, I don't know.

01:02:31.944 --> 01:02:35.144
I shoulda known when
he showed up dressed like

01:02:35.344 --> 01:02:37.343
some undertaker for the art world.

01:02:37.543 --> 01:02:39.643
I like the way he dresses.

01:02:49.343 --> 01:02:52.443
What if this tape
gets into the wrong hands?

01:02:52.643 --> 01:02:57.743
"The wrong hands"? John, we are not
talking about military secrets here.

01:02:58.143 --> 01:03:03.442
They're just tapes he makes
so he can sit around and get off.

01:03:05.642 --> 01:03:08.742
And he doesn't have sex
with any of them? They just talk?

01:03:09.342 --> 01:03:12.242
They just sit around and talk.

01:03:14.242 --> 01:03:18.642
I could almost understand it
if he had sex with them. I mean, almost.

01:03:19.742 --> 01:03:23.742
Why doesn't he just buy some magazines
or some porno movies or somethin'?

01:03:24.541 --> 01:03:28.641
Doesn't work. He has to know the people.
He has to be able to interact with them.

01:03:28.941 --> 01:03:30.941
Interact?

01:03:31.241 --> 01:03:33.141
Whatever that means.

01:03:34.741 --> 01:03:36.941
Did you have to masturbate
in front of him?

01:03:37.141 --> 01:03:40.841
I felt like it. Goddamn. You and Ann
make such a big deal out of this.

01:03:41.041 --> 01:03:43.441
- You told Ann about this?
- She is my sister.

01:03:43.641 --> 01:03:46.241
- I tell her almost everything.
- I wish you hadn't.

01:03:46.441 --> 01:03:49.940
It's just something I'd prefer
she didn't have to know about.

01:03:50.340 --> 01:03:53.740
- She's a grown-up. She can handle it.
- Ann...

01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:58.140
- Ann is just very...
- Hung up.

01:03:59.840 --> 01:04:03.240
- It just wasn't a smart thing to do.
- Oh, God!

01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:09.840
Did you sign any sort of paper,
or did he have a contract with you

01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:13.239
saying that he wouldn't
broadcast these things?

01:04:13.639 --> 01:04:15.539
No, sir.

01:04:15.739 --> 01:04:18.239
You realise you have no recourse legally?

01:04:20.239 --> 01:04:24.139
It's not funny. It's not funny, Cynthia.

01:04:24.439 --> 01:04:27.039
These tapes could show up anywhere.

01:04:27.239 --> 01:04:29.639
They won't. I trust him.

01:04:31.039 --> 01:04:33.639
You trust him? That's funny.

01:04:33.839 --> 01:04:37.338
Yeah, I do.
A hell of a lot more than I trust you.

01:04:40.538 --> 01:04:43.238
- What do you mean?
- Just what I said.

01:04:43.438 --> 01:04:45.938
I'd trust him before I'd trust you.

01:04:48.238 --> 01:04:52.338
- It hurts that you say that to me.
- You're fucking your wife's sister.

01:04:52.738 --> 01:04:54.638
You're a liar. But at least I know that.

01:04:54.838 --> 01:04:59.537
I know, I know. Second-lowest form
of human being. And the first.

01:04:59.937 --> 01:05:04.137
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. You're lying to Ann, too.

01:05:04.437 --> 01:05:10.137
Yeah, right, but I didn't take a vow in front
of God and everyone to be faithful to Ann.

01:05:17.437 --> 01:05:20.237
Look, are we gonna do it or not?

01:05:21.137 --> 01:05:25.736
Actually... no. I've changed my mind.
I shouldn't have called.

01:05:26.936 --> 01:05:32.536
Well, I'm here now.
I need to do somethin'.

01:05:32.936 --> 01:05:35.336
Would you like
to help me straighten up?

01:05:37.136 --> 01:05:38.936
Jesus!

01:05:39.136 --> 01:05:42.136
Is there one chair
in this place that works?

01:05:42.336 --> 01:05:45.536
Well, why don't you
go sit somewhere else?

01:05:47.235 --> 01:05:50.135
Come on, John. You should be happy.

01:05:50.335 --> 01:05:54.135
We've gone this far without Ann findin'
out. I'm makin' it real easy on you.

01:05:54.535 --> 01:05:57.135
- Just walk out of here.
- Did he put you up to this?

01:05:57.435 --> 01:05:59.335
- Who?
- Graham.

01:05:59.535 --> 01:06:03.635
No, he didn't put me up to this. Jesus,
I don't need people to tell me what to do.

01:06:03.935 --> 01:06:07.235
I've just been thinkin', that's all.
Now just... leave.

01:06:09.035 --> 01:06:11.634
Maybe I don't wanna leave.

01:06:11.934 --> 01:06:14.234
Maybe I wanna talk.

01:06:14.434 --> 01:06:17.734
John, we don't have
anything to talk about.

01:06:20.234 --> 01:06:22.234
Yeah, you're right.

01:06:24.234 --> 01:06:27.034
Things are gettin' complicated.

01:06:27.334 --> 01:06:29.534
No, they're gettin' real simple.

01:09:06.227 --> 01:09:07.727
It's open!

01:09:16.527 --> 01:09:18.027
Hello.

01:09:22.626 --> 01:09:24.725
Want something to drink?

01:09:27.225 --> 01:09:29.126
Yeah, thanks.

01:09:36.626 --> 01:09:39.426
I'm sorry, I don't have any iced tea left.

01:09:43.725 --> 01:09:45.625
Thank you.

01:09:51.524 --> 01:09:55.525
John and Cynthia have been... fucking.

01:09:58.425 --> 01:10:00.425
Yes, I know.

01:10:01.425 --> 01:10:03.925
- You know?
- Yes.

01:10:06.125 --> 01:10:08.524
How did you know?

01:10:11.624 --> 01:10:13.924
She said it on her tape.

01:10:14.224 --> 01:10:17.124
Thanks for telling me.
I really appreciate it.

01:10:17.424 --> 01:10:19.624
Well, I... I haven't seen you.

01:10:20.824 --> 01:10:24.724
And I don't think I would've told you
even if I had seen you.

01:10:25.024 --> 01:10:26.924
Why not?

01:10:28.624 --> 01:10:30.923
Because it's not really my place.

01:10:39.823 --> 01:10:41.723
My life is shit.

01:10:43.323 --> 01:10:45.223
It's just shit.

01:10:47.523 --> 01:10:49.823
Nothing's what I thought it was.

01:10:57.822 --> 01:10:59.822
John's a bastard.

01:11:07.422 --> 01:11:09.322
Let's make a videotape.

01:11:12.722 --> 01:11:14.622
No, I...

01:11:15.922 --> 01:11:20.321
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- Why not?

01:11:21.021 --> 01:11:25.421
Because I don't think it's a choice that
you'd make in a normal frame of mind.

01:11:25.721 --> 01:11:28.521
And what would you know
about a normal frame of mind?

01:11:32.721 --> 01:11:34.821
That's a good question.

01:11:38.321 --> 01:11:41.121
- So, what do you have to do to get ready?
- Uh...

01:11:45.520 --> 01:11:47.920
Load a tape and turn on the camera.

01:11:50.620 --> 01:11:52.520
Do it.

01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:05.519
So, where do you get your money from,

01:12:05.919 --> 01:12:10.019
for rent, and tapes, and stuff like that?

01:12:12.019 --> 01:12:14.119
Underneath my mattress.

01:12:15.819 --> 01:12:18.719
And what are you gonna do
when this money runs out?

01:12:19.019 --> 01:12:21.019
It won't.

01:12:22.819 --> 01:12:25.819
Are you comfortable there?

01:12:26.119 --> 01:12:28.319
Yeah, I'm comfortable.

01:12:32.018 --> 01:12:34.318
OK, I'm recording.

01:12:34.518 --> 01:12:36.418
Tell me your name.

01:12:39.318 --> 01:12:41.318
Ann Bishop Millaney.

01:13:13.717 --> 01:13:17.816
Margaret. Hi, it's John. Fine.
Listen, have you seen Ann at all today?

01:13:18.216 --> 01:13:20.116
This afternoon?

01:13:20.416 --> 01:13:23.116
Uh... Well, no, I just...

01:13:23.416 --> 01:13:26.816
She's home. Bye-bye.
Everything's fine. Thanks. Bye.

01:13:27.916 --> 01:13:29.916
Thank God. You had me worried sick.

01:13:30.116 --> 01:13:33.616
I come home,
the door is open, the car is gone.

01:13:34.716 --> 01:13:38.016
I thought you'd been
abducted by some mad fucker.

01:13:40.016 --> 01:13:43.515
- Are you all right?
- I want out of this marriage.

01:13:49.615 --> 01:13:51.215
What?

01:13:53.015 --> 01:13:57.815
I... want... out... of this marriage.

01:14:04.514 --> 01:14:05.914
Why?

01:14:06.714 --> 01:14:08.214
Why?

01:14:10.614 --> 01:14:12.814
You're asking me why?

01:14:15.514 --> 01:14:18.514
I'm married to you
and you want out of this marriage.

01:14:18.814 --> 01:14:20.814
I think you could tell me that.

01:14:22.314 --> 01:14:26.014
Fuck you. Fuck you.

01:14:31.513 --> 01:14:33.513
All right.

01:14:36.613 --> 01:14:40.113
- Can you tell me where you went?
- I drove around.

01:14:40.513 --> 01:14:43.013
- Then I went over to Graham's.
- Graham's?

01:14:43.913 --> 01:14:45.513
Graham.

01:14:51.313 --> 01:14:53.312
Goddamn that son of a bitch!

01:14:53.512 --> 01:14:56.612
The backstabbin' son of a...
Oh, Mr Honesty, huh?

01:14:56.812 --> 01:14:58.812
Mr Apostle of Truth!

01:15:11.212 --> 01:15:13.712
Well, I know you didn't fuck him.

01:15:24.111 --> 01:15:27.411
Did you make one of
these goddamn videotapes?

01:15:32.511 --> 01:15:36.111
Annie... answer me, goddammit.

01:15:36.511 --> 01:15:38.811
Goddammit, answer me. Did you?

01:15:40.210 --> 01:15:42.210
- Yes, I did.
- Ah!

01:15:44.310 --> 01:15:45.810
God!

01:15:46.110 --> 01:15:47.810
Don't you touch him!

01:16:04.609 --> 01:16:06.709
OK. I'm gonna...

01:16:08.609 --> 01:16:11.509
- What?

01:16:12.509 --> 01:16:14.109
Hello?

01:16:16.209 --> 01:16:19.909
John? What the hell are you doing here?
What are you doing?

01:17:04.907 --> 01:17:07.307
OK, I'm recording.

01:17:09.507 --> 01:17:11.507
Tell me your name.

01:17:13.507 --> 01:17:16.506
Ann... Bishop... Millaney.

01:17:18.206 --> 01:17:20.406
So, what do you wanna talk about?

01:17:20.606 --> 01:17:23.806
- What do you usually talk about?
- Sex.

01:17:24.106 --> 01:17:26.506
OK. Let's talk about sex.

01:17:28.006 --> 01:17:30.306
Do you have sex?

01:17:30.506 --> 01:17:32.906
Not very often, no.

01:17:34.606 --> 01:17:37.705
When you do, who usually initiates it?

01:17:37.905 --> 01:17:39.805
He does.

01:17:42.005 --> 01:17:44.105
Is the sex satisfying?

01:17:49.605 --> 01:17:51.505
I don't know.

01:17:52.505 --> 01:17:55.205
I don't know. I don't know what you mean.

01:17:57.305 --> 01:17:59.605
Do you have orgasms?

01:17:59.905 --> 01:18:02.104
I don't think so.

01:18:02.704 --> 01:18:06.604
I mean, I guess, since I'm not sure,
that I've never had one.

01:18:27.403 --> 01:18:32.603
Have you ever thought about having sex
with someone other than your husband?

01:18:33.003 --> 01:18:35.403
Here we go.

01:18:36.403 --> 01:18:38.303
Here we go.

01:18:45.603 --> 01:18:47.903
- Why don't we stop?
- No.

01:18:48.203 --> 01:18:50.202
I don't wanna stop.

01:18:58.902 --> 01:19:03.502
Have you ever thought about having sex
with someone other than your husband?

01:19:03.802 --> 01:19:06.002
I've thought about it.

01:19:06.802 --> 01:19:09.202
- Did you act on it?
- No.

01:19:11.202 --> 01:19:13.101
Why not?

01:19:14.201 --> 01:19:19.601
Because that's how Cynthia thinks.
I hate it when I have feelings that she has.

01:19:22.601 --> 01:19:27.701
It bothers me when I think about men,
because I know that's the way she thinks.

01:19:31.601 --> 01:19:34.101
What other men have you thought about?

01:19:38.300 --> 01:19:40.500
I thought about you.

01:19:42.700 --> 01:19:45.400
- Have you thought about me?
- Yes.

01:19:51.600 --> 01:19:53.600
What did you think?

01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:58.900
I thought about what you would
look like having an orgasm.

01:20:07.599 --> 01:20:10.799
I'd like to know
what I look like havin' an orgasm.

01:20:16.699 --> 01:20:19.599
Can you do that?
Give a woman an orgasm?

01:20:24.398 --> 01:20:25.598
Yes.

01:20:26.698 --> 01:20:28.798
Could you do that for me?

01:20:32.498 --> 01:20:35.698
- No.
- Why not?

01:20:37.298 --> 01:20:39.198
Because I can't.

01:20:39.398 --> 01:20:42.398
- Can't or won't?
- I can't because I won't.

01:20:52.697 --> 01:20:57.197
- You said you weren't always impotent.
- No. Yeah, that's correct.

01:20:59.097 --> 01:21:01.797
- So you have had sex.
- Yes.

01:21:04.597 --> 01:21:09.197
So, what happened?
Was it so bad it turned you off, or...?

01:21:12.696 --> 01:21:15.896
- No, that wasn't the problem.
- What was the problem?

01:21:16.596 --> 01:21:18.996
I was the problem. I was a...

01:21:21.696 --> 01:21:23.996
I was a pathological liar.

01:21:24.696 --> 01:21:27.096
Or I am, I should say.

01:21:27.396 --> 01:21:30.696
The lying is...

01:21:32.396 --> 01:21:36.395
Lying is like alcoholism,
you're continually recovering.

01:21:37.695 --> 01:21:39.595
So that's it?

01:21:40.395 --> 01:21:42.395
You lied?

01:21:44.595 --> 01:21:47.595
- That was part of it.
- So, what else happened?

01:21:49.895 --> 01:21:53.295
Well, at that time, uh... I...

01:21:58.294 --> 01:22:01.694
I used to express my feelings nonverbally,

01:22:07.094 --> 01:22:09.194
and often scared people

01:22:11.394 --> 01:22:13.494
that were close to me.

01:22:14.894 --> 01:22:17.094
Are you still like that?

01:22:18.594 --> 01:22:20.094
No.

01:22:21.794 --> 01:22:23.293
No.

01:22:28.693 --> 01:22:30.893
So you're never gonna make love again?

01:22:31.193 --> 01:22:34.293
I don't... I haven't made any plans, so...

01:22:40.593 --> 01:22:43.893
- If you were in love with me, would you?
- I'm not in love with you.

01:22:44.093 --> 01:22:46.592
- But if you were?
- I can't answer that.

01:22:46.792 --> 01:22:48.492
- Why not?
- I told you.

01:22:48.792 --> 01:22:53.692
- But I don't understand.
- Ann, forget about the sex, you know? I...

01:22:56.492 --> 01:22:59.692
I'm not the same person that I was...
even remotely, you know.

01:22:59.992 --> 01:23:02.592
I'm different in so many ways.

01:23:02.792 --> 01:23:07.592
It'd have a profound effect on the way that
I relate to other people, communicate.

01:23:07.992 --> 01:23:12.691
This, for instance. The way she and I are
talking, it could never have been possible.

01:23:13.091 --> 01:23:16.391
"She"? "The way she...
she and I are talking"?

01:23:17.491 --> 01:23:20.391
- "She"? Who's "she"?
- I'm sorry, I was...

01:23:21.791 --> 01:23:25.591
- That isn't what I was...
- She's Elizabeth? Is that who it is?

01:23:25.991 --> 01:23:30.091
Is that the girl that John
talked about? Is that who it is?

01:23:36.290 --> 01:23:42.690
- I guess. I... I'm sorry.
- So, you're still in contact with her?

01:23:44.190 --> 01:23:46.090
- With Elizabeth?
- No. I'm...

01:23:46.390 --> 01:23:50.590
What do you think Elizabeth
is gonna think about all these videotapes?

01:23:52.190 --> 01:23:55.690
I can't imagine her
bein' too understanding.

01:23:57.589 --> 01:24:02.089
But you're gonna tell her about them,
right, since you don't lie any more?

01:24:02.689 --> 01:24:08.189
As I said, I don't know
what I'm gonna do, exactly.

01:24:08.589 --> 01:24:13.089
I mean... perhaps I won't do anything.

01:24:13.389 --> 01:24:17.089
So, you just came back here
so that you could think about it?

01:24:17.289 --> 01:24:19.989
No, I moved back here for some...

01:24:24.288 --> 01:24:26.988
A sense of closure, you know?

01:24:31.388 --> 01:24:33.488
Resolution of some sort.

01:24:39.488 --> 01:24:46.387
I wanted somebody who was very
important to me to understand that.

01:24:48.387 --> 01:24:52.087
That's... That's pathetic.

01:24:55.987 --> 01:24:58.887
I mean, you can't just...
Oh, my God, Graham.

01:24:59.887 --> 01:25:03.387
You just can't walk up to her
and show her you've changed

01:25:03.587 --> 01:25:05.987
like it's some gift or somethin'.

01:25:09.686 --> 01:25:11.586
And look what you've changed into.

01:25:14.186 --> 01:25:18.586
Nine years. Nine years.
And this is what you come up with.

01:25:20.686 --> 01:25:23.686
Is this what you wanna be
the rest of your life?

01:25:26.986 --> 01:25:29.286
Why are you doin' this?

01:25:30.686 --> 01:25:34.685
Can you tell me that?
Why are you doin' this to yourself?

01:25:38.185 --> 01:25:40.685
- Are you gonna answer me?
- Please, don't do that.

01:25:40.985 --> 01:25:42.785
- Why not?
- Don't do that.

01:25:42.985 --> 01:25:46.385
I wanna ask a few questions, like why
do you tape women talkin' about sex?

01:25:46.785 --> 01:25:49.285
Why do you do that?
Can you tell me why?

01:25:50.785 --> 01:25:52.985
Come on. I'm just gonna keep askin'.

01:25:53.285 --> 01:25:55.884
I don't find turning the tables
very interesting.

01:25:56.184 --> 01:25:59.084
Well, I do. Tell me why, Graham.

01:25:59.284 --> 01:26:00.984
- Why?
- What?

01:26:01.184 --> 01:26:04.984
What? What do you want me to tell you?
"Tell me why?" Why?

01:26:07.484 --> 01:26:12.284
Ann, you don't even know who I am. You
don't have the slightest idea who I am.

01:26:14.584 --> 01:26:19.383
Am I supposed to recount all the points
in my life leading up to this moment

01:26:19.883 --> 01:26:23.483
and just hope that it's coherent,
that it makes some sort of sense to you?

01:26:23.983 --> 01:26:27.383
It doesn't make any sense to me.
You know, I was there.

01:26:28.183 --> 01:26:30.683
I don't have the slightest idea who I am,

01:26:30.883 --> 01:26:34.083
and I'm supposed
to be able to explain it to you?

01:26:34.783 --> 01:26:37.483
And why? You tell me why.

01:26:38.083 --> 01:26:40.383
Why do I have to explain myself to you?

01:26:40.683 --> 01:26:42.982
Because maybe I can help you.

01:26:44.382 --> 01:26:46.982
- Help me with what?
- Your problem.

01:26:48.482 --> 01:26:50.882
My problem? Do I have a problem?

01:26:51.682 --> 01:26:56.782
I look around me in this town and I see
John and Cynthia and you, and I...

01:26:58.582 --> 01:27:00.982
I feel comparatively healthy.

01:27:05.582 --> 01:27:07.681
You've got a problem.

01:27:12.081 --> 01:27:13.981
You're right.

01:27:20.881 --> 01:27:23.081
I've got a lot of problems.

01:27:31.280 --> 01:27:33.480
But they belong to me.

01:27:36.380 --> 01:27:39.680
You think they're yours, but they're not.

01:27:39.980 --> 01:27:43.980
Everybody that walks in that door
becomes part of your problem.

01:27:44.380 --> 01:27:47.480
Anybody that comes in contact with you.

01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:53.580
I didn't wanna be
part of your problem, but I am.

01:27:54.979 --> 01:27:57.079
I'm leavin' my husband,

01:27:57.179 --> 01:28:01.279
and maybe I would have anyway,
but the fact is that I'm doin' it now.

01:28:04.079 --> 01:28:06.579
And part of it's because of you.

01:28:12.379 --> 01:28:14.879
You've had an effect on my life.

01:28:20.078 --> 01:28:22.578
This isn't supposed to happen.

01:28:27.378 --> 01:28:31.978
I've spent nine years structuring my life
so that this didn't happen.

01:32:28.768 --> 01:32:32.668
You know, I never told you this,
cos I knew it'd crush you.

01:32:35.468 --> 01:32:37.468
But now...

01:32:38.468 --> 01:32:40.567
I fucked Elizabeth.

01:32:40.767 --> 01:32:44.767
Before you broke up.
Before you were havin' trouble, even.

01:32:47.867 --> 01:32:49.667
She's no saint.

01:32:49.767 --> 01:32:51.967
She was good in bed.

01:32:52.867 --> 01:32:55.167
She could keep a secret.

01:32:57.067 --> 01:32:59.567
That's about all I can say about her.

01:33:57.064 --> 01:34:00.564
- I gotta make a call.
- Yeah, sure.

01:34:02.664 --> 01:34:05.764
- Kirkland's office.
- John Millaney for Brian Kirkland.

01:34:06.064 --> 01:34:08.164
- Just one moment, please.
- All right.

01:34:08.364 --> 01:34:11.564
Anyway, as I've always said,
work is critical.

01:34:12.264 --> 01:34:17.763
I can be happy without a marriage, but if
you take away my work, that's different.

01:34:18.163 --> 01:34:22.063
And if Ann can't handle that...

01:34:24.263 --> 01:34:27.563
- Well, that's her problem.
- Mr Millaney?

01:34:27.863 --> 01:34:30.163
- Yeah.
- Mr DeForest would like to see you.

01:34:30.563 --> 01:34:32.663
All right. In a minute. I'm on with a client.

01:34:32.963 --> 01:34:36.863
- He said immediately.
- All right. Jesus.

01:34:37.062 --> 01:34:38.662
- Mr Millaney?
- Yeah?

01:34:38.862 --> 01:34:42.862
Mr Kirkland asked me to inform you
he's obtained representation elsewhere,

01:34:43.262 --> 01:34:46.462
and that if you have a message
for Mr Kirkland to leave it with me.

01:34:46.662 --> 01:34:48.662
Thank you. Um...

01:34:50.562 --> 01:34:52.462
- No message.
- All right, Mr Millaney.

01:34:52.762 --> 01:34:54.662
Thank you.

01:34:54.962 --> 01:34:56.462
Fool!

01:34:58.062 --> 01:35:00.062
Hope he knows what he's doin'.

01:35:00.562 --> 01:35:02.061
- Mr Millaney?
- Yeah?

01:35:02.361 --> 01:35:06.361
- Mr DeForest is waiting.
- All right. Tell him I'll be in in a minute.

01:35:06.661 --> 01:35:11.261
Jesus, the old man thinks that
the world revolves around a game of golf.

01:35:11.561 --> 01:35:14.861
I'll catch up to you at the courts.
I'd better go talk to DeForest.

01:35:15.061 --> 01:35:16.361
Sure.

01:35:17.461 --> 01:35:18.561
OK.

01:35:26.160 --> 01:35:27.660
Fuck.

01:35:47.260 --> 01:35:49.659
Oh, no, just one's fine, thanks.

01:35:52.959 --> 01:35:55.059
This is my favourite part.

01:36:00.659 --> 01:36:03.659
You know, I was thinking we should
name our first child Rusty.

01:36:03.959 --> 01:36:06.259
What do you think of that name?

01:36:09.959 --> 01:36:15.158
OK. You know, I spend a lot of money in
here. I should at least know your name.

01:36:15.458 --> 01:36:17.458
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:36:18.558 --> 01:36:21.958
I brought you this.
I knew it was your birthday.

01:36:23.458 --> 01:36:27.358
- Thanks.
- It's a nice plant. Looks like a tablecloth.

01:36:32.458 --> 01:36:35.258
Look, I can't stay. I gotta go.

01:36:37.057 --> 01:36:39.757
- Can I call you?
- Do you have my work number?

01:36:39.957 --> 01:36:41.057
No.

01:36:43.057 --> 01:36:45.157
Got a pen?

01:36:49.257 --> 01:36:51.857
OK, now, you're wearing blue,
I'm wearing blue.

01:36:52.157 --> 01:36:54.757
Is this some sort of weird coincidence?

01:36:54.957 --> 01:36:58.157
I don't think so.
I think it's something more.

01:36:58.357 --> 01:37:01.756
- Do you live here?
- No. I'm just passing through.

01:37:05.056 --> 01:37:09.456
Look, don't call between three and five,
cos I get real busy, OK?

01:37:09.756 --> 01:37:11.756
- OK.
- OK.

01:37:12.656 --> 01:37:14.656
See ya.

01:37:14.856 --> 01:37:16.856
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:37:19.956 --> 01:37:24.055
I like her.
She's a very nice girl. Very nice.

01:37:36.255 --> 01:37:38.155
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:37:45.655 --> 01:37:47.654
I think it's gonna rain.

01:37:52.254 --> 01:37:54.254
It is raining.

01:37:55.254 --> 01:37:56.954
Yeah.

01:39:27.150 --> 01:39:32.950
