00:03.734 --> 00:05.934
as you know, this is
Career Education Week.

00:05.934 --> 00:08.200
These are the results
of your aptitude tests.

00:08.200 --> 00:09.567
They'll show you

00:09.567 --> 00:11.500
what careers
you're best suited for.

00:13.467 --> 00:15.300
"Policewoman"?

00:15.300 --> 00:16.467
"Furniture salesman"?

00:16.467 --> 00:17.600
"Teacher"? Oh, no.

00:17.600 --> 00:19.734
Uh, Mr. Grozowtski,
this is ridiculous.

00:19.734 --> 00:20.700
I couldn't even

00:20.700 --> 00:22.700

00:27.600 --> 00:30.600

are very accurate.

00:30.600 --> 00:32.300
Took one myself when
I was your age.

00:32.300 --> 00:34.033
And it said
you should be a teacher?

00:35.200 --> 00:36.500
Anyway, you'll notice

is an assignment card.

00:42.934 --> 00:44.467

00:44.467 --> 00:46.700
"Mrs. Applebaum."
That's Cory's teacher.

with him already.

Just keep your mouths shut,

03:45.900 --> 03:47.767
Thanks, Detective Ramirez.

03:47.767 --> 03:49.033
I had a great time.

03:51.133 --> 03:52.734
Okay, you guys,

03:52.734 --> 03:54.600
the first thing I learned
about police work

03:54.600 --> 03:55.867
is do not play
with handcuffs,

03:55.867 --> 03:57.934
'cause they are super hard
to get out of.

03:57.934 --> 03:59.300
Ow.

03:59.300 --> 04:00.767
Thanks for the tip, Chelsea.

04:00.767 --> 04:01.934
But something went on

04:01.934 --> 04:03.100
in Cory's class today,

04:03.100 --> 04:04.934
and we're trying to get
to the bottom of it.

this the hard way.

What's it gonna be?

Can I just tell my story,

04:25.500 --> 04:27.600
Okay. I think I
broke her down.

10:19.934 --> 10:21.734
(<i>screaming </i>)

10:21.734 --> 10:24.300
(<i>crying </i>):
I'm sorry!

10:24.300 --> 10:26.367
It's my job--
I was only thinking

10:26.367 --> 10:27.967
of the other children.

10:27.967 --> 10:29.467
They look so hungry.

10:29.467 --> 10:31.100
Fine.

10:31.100 --> 10:34.400
You might as well get
some meat on your bones.

10:34.400 --> 10:37.200
It'll be more of you
to boss around.

10:37.200 --> 10:38.467
Give me that!

10:39.834 --> 10:41.100
If you want a snack,

10:41.100 --> 10:43.000
(<i>crunching </i>)
line up.

10:45.100 --> 10:47.967
This is all
you're getting,
so make it last.

10:53.667 --> 10:56.667
Please... I'm so weak,

10:56.667 --> 10:59.000
may I have some m-more?

10:59.000 --> 11:00.734
(<i>shrieks </i>):
More?!

11:04.000 --> 11:08.100
Sister, please,
he'll never make it
through the winter.

11:08.100 --> 11:11.200
Can I at least give him
one marshmallow?

11:14.033 --> 11:15.767
Maybe just one.

11:15.767 --> 11:17.567
<i>But... </i>he has to catch it

11:17.567 --> 11:19.567
in his mouth.

11:19.567 --> 11:21.600
(<i>fiendish laughter </i>)

11:21.600 --> 11:24.200
I'm such a bossy boots.

11:33.133 --> 11:34.500
(<i>gasps </i>)

11:36.200 --> 11:39.367
Snack time...

11:39.367 --> 11:41.000
is over!

11:46.467 --> 11:47.800
RAVEN:
Oh...!

11:47.800 --> 11:49.800
I'm melting!

11:49.800 --> 11:53.500
I'm melting!

11:57.000 --> 11:59.834
This is all

11:59.834 --> 12:01.667
your fault!

12:01.667 --> 12:02.800
(<i>hissing </i>)

12:02.800 --> 12:04.200
(<i>screaming </i>)

12:05.967 --> 12:07.667
(<i>growls </i>)

12:08.233 --> 12:09.100
Mrs. Applebaum!

12:09.100 --> 12:11.000
Let me get out of here!

12:16.934 --> 12:18.100
Stay back.

12:18.100 --> 12:19.233
Stay back,

12:19.233 --> 12:20.700
you evil spirit!

12:20.700 --> 12:23.500
(<i>screaming </i>):
Stay back!

12:28.200 --> 12:29.600
(<i>gasps </i>)

12:30.600 --> 12:32.867
(<i>screams </i>)

12:32.867 --> 12:34.367
(<i>groans </i>)

12:36.467 --> 12:39.100
CORY:
<i>And that's exactly</i>
<i>what happened.</i>

12:39.100 --> 12:40.400
TONYA:
I am so

12:40.400 --> 12:42.367
disappointed in you.

12:42.367 --> 12:43.734
You happy?

12:43.734 --> 12:47.300
You see? You broke
Mom's heart.

12:47.300 --> 12:48.767
I am talking about both of you--

12:48.767 --> 12:51.133
making up stories
to get each other in trouble.

12:51.133 --> 12:53.500
Mama, he does not need
my help getting in trouble.

12:53.500 --> 12:55.233
I don't need your
help with anything,

12:55.233 --> 12:58.400
but that doesn't stop
you from getting all
up in my business.

12:58.400 --> 13:01.033
Okay, let's end this.
That's what
I'm saying, Dad,

13:01.033 --> 13:03.734
'cause I got plans
this weekend...
No, you don't.

13:03.734 --> 13:06.200
I want both of you to go
up to your rooms right now

13:06.200 --> 13:08.500
and stay there until
you're ready to tell us

13:08.500 --> 13:09.767
what really happened!

13:09.767 --> 13:13.033
See what you did?!
See what you did?!

13:13.033 --> 13:14.967
Well, well,
seems like I've got

13:14.967 --> 13:17.000
enough to go on, sir.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.133
What do you got?

13:18.133 --> 13:20.200
Maybe nothing.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.300
Maybe everything.

13:22.300 --> 13:25.667
Most likely nothing.

13:30.200 --> 13:33.100
Hey, y'all, wait till you see
how Big All the Sofa King and I

13:33.100 --> 13:35.000
hooked y'all right on up.
This way.

13:40.667 --> 13:42.300
Pretty fly, huh?

13:47.300 --> 13:49.400
Where did you...
How did you...

13:49.400 --> 13:50.767
No, don't thank me.

13:50.767 --> 13:52.033
Thank Big Al
the Sofa King.

13:52.033 --> 13:54.500
Yeah, he said this stuff
came straight from Italy.

13:54.500 --> 13:57.467
Does it have
a round-trip ticket?

13:57.467 --> 14:00.400
Whoa, you're not feeling this?

14:00.400 --> 14:02.867
I'm not feeling it,
I'm not touching it,

14:02.867 --> 14:04.700
I don't even want to look at it.

14:04.700 --> 14:06.867
(<i>sighs </i>):
Oh, well,

14:06.867 --> 14:09.867
guess this is
a little too youthful.

14:09.867 --> 14:11.867
Excuse me?

14:11.867 --> 14:13.100
Hey, y'all too old to be trying

14:13.100 --> 14:14.967
to keep up with
all the latest trends and stuff.

14:14.967 --> 14:16.200
My grandmother's the same way.

14:16.200 --> 14:17.600
Your grandmother?!

14:17.600 --> 14:19.300
Let me tell you
something.

14:19.300 --> 14:21.300
We are just as young and hip

14:21.300 --> 14:24.233
and funky fresh
as anybody else out there.

14:24.233 --> 14:25.467
Great, Mr. B,

14:25.467 --> 14:26.600
glad to hear you say that.

14:26.600 --> 14:27.867
So will it be cash or charge?

14:27.867 --> 14:28.867
Cash.
Victor...

14:28.867 --> 14:29.734
Charge.
Victor!

14:29.734 --> 14:30.800
What? We got to pay

14:30.800 --> 14:31.767
for it somehow!

14:31.767 --> 14:34.000
We're not buying it.

14:34.000 --> 14:35.500
R-R-Right.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.500
Just get us our furniture back.

14:37.500 --> 14:39.500
Well, if you insist.

14:40.467 --> 14:43.467
Make a couple phone calls.

14:44.300 --> 14:46.567
Yeah, Big Al?

14:46.567 --> 14:48.600
(<i>laughs </i>):
No, Little Ed.

14:48.600 --> 14:51.000
Yeah. Well,
they don't want it.

14:51.000 --> 14:53.300
She wouldn't let him.

14:53.300 --> 14:54.500
Uh-huh.

14:54.500 --> 14:57.734
Well, apparently, the wife

14:57.734 --> 14:59.233
wears the pants
in the family.

14:59.233 --> 15:01.200
I'm just saying,
that's all I'm saying.

15:01.200 --> 15:04.300
(<i>laughs </i>):
You know...
That is not even
a real phone.

15:04.300 --> 15:06.100
It's got candy in it.

15:06.100 --> 15:07.767
Get out of here!

15:08.667 --> 15:13.834
You broke my phone, brother.

15:13.834 --> 15:17.600
You know, he might just have
a future in this business.

15:17.600 --> 15:19.567
Okay, you guys,
I just had a big break

15:19.567 --> 15:21.500
in the case.

15:21.500 --> 15:25.400
Something...
is different
around here.

15:25.400 --> 15:27.467
You know, Chelsea,
nothing gets by you.

15:27.467 --> 15:28.834
Yeah, I know.

15:28.834 --> 15:30.700
It's my keen eye for detail

15:30.700 --> 15:33.400
that makes me so amazing
at police work.

15:33.400 --> 15:34.734
What can I say?

15:34.734 --> 15:36.700
Now, if you'll join me
in the kitchen,

15:36.700 --> 15:38.500
I've got me a crime to solve.

15:40.300 --> 15:43.100
All right, folks,
I'm gonna need the suspects.

15:45.100 --> 15:46.600
That'd be your children.

15:46.600 --> 15:49.900
Um, Cory? Raven?

15:49.900 --> 15:54.700
You know she's not really
a detective, right?

15:54.700 --> 15:56.867
Hi. Okay, all right,
we're gonna break this down.

15:56.867 --> 16:00.467
Take a seat, take a seat,
take seat, take a seat.

16:00.467 --> 16:04.734
Now, I've uncovered
a surprise witness for y'all.

16:04.734 --> 16:06.133
Surprise witness,

16:06.133 --> 16:08.200
could you come on out here,
please?

16:08.200 --> 16:09.667
Thank you.

16:09.667 --> 16:12.200
Obviously, our witness
would rather not be identified,

16:12.200 --> 16:14.100
so we're gonna respect
his privacy.

16:14.100 --> 16:16.000
Take a seat.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.367
Right there.

16:17.367 --> 16:19.100
Larry.

16:19.100 --> 16:21.500
How'd you know it was me?

16:21.500 --> 16:24.967
Man, you been wearing
that same sweatshirt
for two weeks.

16:24.967 --> 16:27.400
Hey, Larry, we just
want to know the truth.

16:27.400 --> 16:30.600
The only thing that
Cory and Raven seem
to agree upon

16:30.600 --> 16:33.600
is that Mrs. Applebaum
left the room in-in tears.

16:33.600 --> 16:34.967
LARRY:
Well,

16:34.967 --> 16:37.100
I guess that's kind of true.
Uh-huh.

16:37.100 --> 16:39.000
<i>What really happened was...</i>

16:39.000 --> 16:43.300
(<i>crying </i>):
It's an honor I will treasure
for the rest of my life.

16:43.300 --> 16:44.400
Oh, Mrs. Applebaum,

16:44.400 --> 16:46.233
are you crying
because you're leaving?

16:46.233 --> 16:50.734
Oh, no, it's this new mascara--
I think I'm allergic to it.

16:50.734 --> 16:53.200
Raven, Cory, is that true?

16:53.200 --> 16:54.300
Eh...
Eh...

16:54.300 --> 16:56.100
(<i>both mumbling </i>):
Eh, yeah...

16:57.033 --> 16:58.934
Okay, Larry, what
happened next?

16:58.934 --> 17:00.934
Well, I was staring
at Raven...

17:00.934 --> 17:02.200
Because of my beauty?

17:02.200 --> 17:03.800
Not exactly.

17:05.600 --> 17:08.367
<i>You had some green stuff</i>
<i>stuck in your teeth.</i>

17:09.800 --> 17:12.367
Yeah, you know what,
I should not have had

17:12.367 --> 17:14.700
that spinach omelet
for breakfast, no.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.934
Okay, Larry, just focus--
what happened next?

17:16.934 --> 17:18.400
Well, it was snack time,

17:18.400 --> 17:19.967
<i>and things turned ugly.</i>

17:19.967 --> 17:22.200
Raven, it's time for me
to pass out the snacks.

17:22.200 --> 17:25.100
Sounds more like time
to take advantage
of your sister.

17:25.100 --> 17:26.967
I'm not taking advantage of you.

17:26.967 --> 17:28.400
This really is my job.

17:28.400 --> 17:30.767
Then it must be
my job to tell you
to sit back down.

17:30.767 --> 17:33.233
It's snack time,
and I'm giving out the cookies.

17:34.200 --> 17:36.300
Snack time? Cory,

17:36.300 --> 17:38.700
the teacher said
nothing about snacks.

17:38.700 --> 17:41.300
Cory! Give me
those cookies.
No!

17:41.300 --> 17:42.900
BOTH:
Give me the cookies!

17:44.400 --> 17:46.367
So you both broke them.

17:46.367 --> 17:48.100
LARRY:
Everyone was hungry,

17:48.100 --> 17:50.834
so Cory went
to the candy closet.

17:52.934 --> 17:55.734
Cory, you better not open those.
Okay. Here, Larry, open that.

17:58.300 --> 18:01.934
LARRY:
<i>Okay, so that one was my bad.</i>
(<i>Raven yells </i>)

18:01.934 --> 18:05.200
Cory, you are
in big trouble now!

18:08.767 --> 18:11.834
Aah! My shirt!

18:11.834 --> 18:15.667
That's right-- a bowling trophy
smashed the juice.

18:16.967 --> 18:20.033
My shirt! Oh!

18:20.033 --> 18:22.200
Cory, this is all your fault.

18:22.200 --> 18:23.467
What? I didn't do it.

18:23.467 --> 18:24.900
Cory...
No, I didn't.

18:26.734 --> 18:30.100
LARRY:
<i>That wasn't a very good place</i>
<i>for a hook.</i>

18:30.100 --> 18:32.600
My shirt!

18:32.600 --> 18:33.700
Cory...

18:36.367 --> 18:38.400
Whoa! Whoa, whoa...

18:39.100 --> 18:40.867
<i>And I think you know</i>

18:40.867 --> 18:42.467
<i>what happens next.</i>

18:42.467 --> 18:44.400
(<i>gasps </i>)

18:48.500 --> 18:50.200
(<i>screams </i>)

18:50.200 --> 18:52.200
(<i>groans </i>)

18:54.367 --> 18:56.767
<i>And that's</i>
<i>what really happened.</i>

18:56.767 --> 18:59.100
It was all an accident.

18:59.100 --> 19:00.233
CHELSEA:
Well,

19:00.233 --> 19:01.600
case closed.

19:01.600 --> 19:04.200
Come on, Larry,
I'm taking you downtown, son.

19:04.200 --> 19:06.600
To the police station?

19:06.600 --> 19:08.867
No, silly, for
an ice cream cone.

19:08.867 --> 19:11.000
You've done good, kid.

19:12.867 --> 19:15.200
What upsets me

19:15.200 --> 19:17.700
is that this whole thing
could've been avoided.

19:17.700 --> 19:20.300
But both of you expected
the worst in each other,

19:20.300 --> 19:22.000
and that's exactly what you got.

19:22.000 --> 19:23.367
Mom, come on,
how was I supposed

19:23.367 --> 19:25.767
to know that out of
all the kids in Cory's class,

19:25.767 --> 19:28.100
he was the one in charge
of handing out the snacks?

19:28.100 --> 19:29.800
It<i>was </i>my job.

19:29.800 --> 19:31.200
I was Student of the Week.

19:31.200 --> 19:32.300
VICTOR:
He got straight A's,

19:32.300 --> 19:34.400
and he had
perfect behavior.

19:34.400 --> 19:35.567
Cory?

19:35.567 --> 19:37.000
This Cory?

19:37.000 --> 19:38.900
You? See, I had no idea.

19:38.900 --> 19:42.934
You know, you should read the
refrigerator door more often.

19:42.934 --> 19:44.100
See? You shouldn't have

19:44.100 --> 19:45.667
came in there all bossy.

19:45.667 --> 19:47.467
I wasn't bossy.

19:47.467 --> 19:48.867
I was nervous.

19:48.867 --> 19:50.567
You were nervous?

19:50.567 --> 19:52.700
You're not afraid of anything.

19:52.700 --> 19:54.934
You know, I was afraid
I would mess up

19:54.934 --> 19:57.300
and... embarrass myself.

19:57.300 --> 20:00.467
I didn't know you worried
about stuff like that.

20:00.467 --> 20:01.867
TONYA:
You know,

20:01.867 --> 20:04.800
maybe the two of you
learned something
about each other

20:04.800 --> 20:06.800
that will bring you
closer together.

20:06.800 --> 20:10.700
Mm-hmm. Especially when you two
are doing extra chores

20:10.700 --> 20:13.867
to help pay
for Mrs. Applebaum's portrait.

20:13.867 --> 20:16.200
You can start with the dusting.

20:16.200 --> 20:18.567
Come on, little bro.

20:22.500 --> 20:24.934
What in the...?
Whoa!

20:24.934 --> 20:27.200
I love it!

20:27.200 --> 20:28.900
I hate it!
It's cool!

20:28.900 --> 20:30.734
It's ridiculous!

20:30.734 --> 20:32.834
You know, I think this
is a real turning point

20:32.834 --> 20:33.967
for Cory and Raven.

20:33.967 --> 20:37.200
(<i>loud crash </i>)

20:45.200 --> 20:46.900
She did it!
He did it!

20:52.934 --> 20:55.033
GROZOWTSKI:
<i>So, how were your</i>

20:55.033 --> 20:56.934
career experiences?
I don't know, Mr. G.

20:56.934 --> 20:58.600
I didn't sell anything.

20:58.600 --> 21:00.767
Yeah, teaching-- not my thing.

21:00.767 --> 21:02.600
Well, I don't know
about you guys,

21:02.600 --> 21:04.734
but I was born
for police work. Born.

21:04.734 --> 21:07.200
Well, still, it's amazing
I got even one right--

21:07.200 --> 21:09.734
considering I lost
the answer key to your tests

21:09.734 --> 21:11.400
and... I made up the results.

21:11.400 --> 21:13.133
Oh, man!
All right, all right,
all right,

21:13.133 --> 21:14.400
all right.

21:14.400 --> 21:16.734
I found the key.
Here are the correct results.

21:20.900 --> 21:22.667
Musician!

21:22.667 --> 21:24.300
Fashion designer!

21:24.300 --> 21:28.400
Environmental biologist?!

21:28.400 --> 21:31.734
Chels, come on,
that's what you've
always wanted to be.

21:31.734 --> 21:33.000
Well, yeah, I know,

21:33.000 --> 21:34.600
but... I don't know, Rae,

21:34.600 --> 21:37.700
I'm kind of really gonna miss
the action, you know?

21:37.700 --> 21:38.867
Actually,

21:38.867 --> 21:40.767
Rae, do you mind
standing up for a minute?

21:40.767 --> 21:41.734
What?
Just a minute.

21:41.734 --> 21:42.967
In the middle
of the class?

21:42.967 --> 21:44.500
Quick second, yeah.
All right spread 'em!

21:44.500 --> 21:46.000
Spread 'em, spread 'em.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.100
All right,

21:47.100 --> 21:48.867
you have the right
to remain silent.

21:48.867 --> 21:50.300
And...

21:50.300 --> 21:52.233
you have the right
to an attorney.

21:52.233 --> 21:53.767
Mm-hmm.

21:53.767 --> 21:55.500
Chels?
What?

21:55.500 --> 21:58.033
You do have the keys
to those, right?
