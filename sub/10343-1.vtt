BENNETT: The smell is sweet,
with urine only a minor component,

03:09.606 --> 03:13.343
the prevalent odour suggesting
the inside of someone's ear.

03:13.443 --> 03:15.596
Dank clothes are there, too,

03:15.696 --> 03:18.932

the essence of poverty,

03:29.960 --> 03:32.529
Miss Shepherd's multi-flavoured aroma

03:32.629 --> 03:36.617
is masked by a liberal application
of various talcum powders,

03:36.717 --> 03:40.287
with Yardley's Lavender
always a favourite.

03:40.387 --> 03:42.873
And currently it is this genteel fragrance

03:42.973 --> 03:48.895
that dominates the second subject,
as it were, in her odoriferous concerto.

03:49.980 --> 03:53.524
But as she goes,
the original theme returns,

03:53.734 --> 03:57.763
her own primary odour
now triumphantly restated

03:57.863 --> 04:01.490
and left hanging in the house
long after she has departed.

04:02.701 --> 04:03.743

In future, I would prefer
if you didn't use my lavatory.

04:11.668 --> 04:13.737
There are lavatories at the bottom
of the High Street. Use those.

04:13.837 --> 04:17.339
They smell.
And I'm by nature a very clean person.

04:17.466 --> 04:21.093
I have a testimonial for a clean room,
awarded me some years ago.

04:21.511 --> 04:24.722
And, do you know,
my aunt, herself spotless,

04:25.057 --> 04:28.309
said I was the cleanest
of all my mother's children,

04:28.477 --> 04:31.354
particularly in the unseen places.

04:39.363 --> 04:40.988
BENNETT: The writer is double.

04:43.367 --> 04:47.536
There is the self who does the writing,
and there is the self who does the living.

04:48.538 --> 04:51.483
And they talk. They argue.

04:51.583 --> 04:54.528
Writing is talking to oneself.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.405
And I've been doing it all my life,

04:56.505 --> 05:00.383

five years ago.

- Saint John, the disciple whom Jesus loved.

No. The name's Bennett.

06:14.791 --> 06:17.626

06:24.092 --> 06:25.468
Well, was it distilled water?

06:26.386 --> 06:29.998
It was holy water, so it doesn't matter
if it's distilled or not.

06:30.098 --> 06:32.876
'Course, the oil is another possibility.

06:32.976 --> 06:34.378
That's not holy, too?

06:34.478 --> 06:38.397
Holy oil? Well, in a van,
it would be far too expensive. Now.

- Hmm.

- (GASPS)

16:01.294 --> 16:03.712
Yeah. It's the van.

16:04.213 --> 16:06.616
- It gets very close.
- I imagine.

16:06.716 --> 16:07.716
You're tall.

16:08.092 --> 16:12.054
My husband was tall.
I'm Mrs Vaughan Williams.

16:18.144 --> 16:19.227
MRS VAUGHAN: Among other things.

16:19.562 --> 16:23.565
Why? Are you musical?
I don't even know your name.

16:23.733 --> 16:26.068
It's Miss Shepherd.

16:26.903 --> 16:32.407

I'm in an incognito position, possibly.

in the war, apparently.

16:39.040 --> 16:40.066
Well, where did she spring from?

16:40.166 --> 16:41.818
- And a nun once.
- A nun?

16:41.918 --> 16:43.418
In the convent up the street.

16:43.711 --> 16:48.241
Still, everybody's got something to hide.
My brother-in-law's a policeman.

16:48.341 --> 16:51.703
That's Camden!
People wash up here. Like me.

16:51.803 --> 16:53.037

- Oh!

16:53.137 --> 16:55.290

- What for?

I don't want a social worker. I'm about
to listen to the repeat of Any Answers?

17:34.137 --> 17:37.415
I brought you some clothes.
You wrote asking for a coat.

17:37.515 --> 17:40.517
Not during Any Answers? I'm a busy woman.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.562

Yes. It's one of our special sticks.

I want an ordinary stick, only longer.

whom should I call?

18:11.340 --> 18:13.884
Well, you can try Mr Bennett at 23.

18:14.010 --> 18:18.805
Only don't take any notice of what he says.
He's a communist, possibly.

BENNETT: Well, have you tried
the people opposite? They're nearer.

18:23.978 --> 18:28.148
Well, they said they don't relate to her.
You were the one she related to.

18:28.524 --> 18:31.359
Is that what they said? "Related to"?

18:31.527 --> 18:33.471
No, that's me. (CHUCKLES)

18:37.825 --> 18:40.702
- She was your girlfriend.
- Oh, Jesus.

18:41.704 --> 18:43.038
Does she use your lavatory?

18:43.539 --> 18:45.707
Well, only in an emergency.

That's medicinal.

19:08.231 --> 19:11.884
Well, she seemed very understanding,
the social worker.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.236
Mmm-hmm. Not understanding enough.

19:14.487 --> 19:18.224
I mean, I ask for a wheelchair,
and what does she get me?

19:18.324 --> 19:19.491
A walking stick.

19:20.076 --> 19:23.411
And she says I don't get an allowance
unless I get an address?

19:23.579 --> 19:26.441
Look, "The Van, Gloucester Crescent".
Isn't that an address?

19:26.541 --> 19:29.376
No! It needs to be a house.

19:31.087 --> 19:33.421
A residence.

19:35.591 --> 19:39.094
Anyway, I might be
going away soon, possibly.

It was coming up Parkway.

19:58.114 --> 20:00.448
A long grey snake.

20:00.783 --> 20:03.019
- It was a boa constrictor, possibly.
- No.

20:03.119 --> 20:05.021
It looked poisonous.

20:05.121 --> 20:06.898
It was keeping close to the wall,

20:06.998 --> 20:10.318
and I have a feeling
it was headed for the van.

20:10.418 --> 20:11.402
No, Miss Shepherd...

20:11.502 --> 20:15.031
I thought I'd better warn you,
just to be on the safe side.

20:15.131 --> 20:17.700
I've had some close shaves with snakes.

20:17.800 --> 20:21.579
Listen to me, Miss Shepherd, there are no
boa constrictors in Camden Town.

20:21.679 --> 20:26.584
What, are you calling me a liar?
I know a boa constrictor when I see one.

Looking especially lovely today, sweetheart.

28:43.555 --> 28:45.390
Telling me about paint.

28:45.724 --> 28:49.394
I was in infant school.
I won a prize for painting!

28:49.603 --> 28:51.437
- But it's all lumps. You have to mix it.
- I have.

28:51.730 --> 28:55.733
I have mixed it.
Only I got some Madeira cake in it.

28:56.318 --> 28:57.803
BENNETT: Cake or no cake,

28:57.903 --> 29:01.181
all Miss Shepherd's vehicles ended up
looking as if they'd been given a coat

29:01.281 --> 29:04.075
of badly made custard,
or plastered with scrambled eggs.

29:04.576 --> 29:06.077
Divine! (CHUCKLES)

29:06.954 --> 29:11.066
Still, there were few occasions
on which one saw her genuinely happy,

29:11.166 --> 29:13.501
and one of these
was when she was putting paint on.

29:13.669 --> 29:17.004
Jackson Pollock himself
could not have done it better.

29:18.799 --> 29:20.341
Even with a pan scrub.

29:27.391 --> 29:30.184
What're you doing? Get off my van!

29:30.936 --> 29:33.104
- Yellow lines.
- Sorry?

29:33.439 --> 29:35.273
Parking restrictions.

29:36.275 --> 29:38.943
- MRS VAUGHAN: Oh, what a bore.
- BENNETT: She'll be illegally parked.

29:39.278 --> 29:40.695
She'll have to move.

29:41.864 --> 29:42.905
(GASPS)

29:46.118 --> 29:47.785
Look. Look.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.271
BENNETT: It's a removal order.

29:49.371 --> 29:51.357
MISS SHEPHERD:
I know it's a removal order.

29:51.457 --> 29:53.374
Well, it means
you'll have to drive on somewhere else.

29:53.542 --> 29:55.194
But I'm disabled!

29:55.294 --> 29:59.088
I don't always use a walking stick.
That pulls the wool over people's eyes.

29:59.381 --> 30:02.216
But I am a bona fide resident of Camden!

30:02.634 --> 30:06.304
And I had rheumatic fever as a child,
and mumps.

30:06.472 --> 30:09.140
I still think you'll have
to move on. Go somewhere else.

30:09.308 --> 30:11.767
It won't move. There's not enough juice.

30:11.894 --> 30:14.812
- Well, I'll get you some up the road.
- I don't like their petrol!

30:14.980 --> 30:18.816
I don't know. It could be, it could go.
It just might need a bit of coaxing.

30:19.902 --> 30:20.902
What I'm...

30:21.695 --> 30:26.032
What I'm worried about particularly
are the wheels.

30:26.909 --> 30:29.243
They're under divine protection.

30:29.495 --> 30:32.788
If I do get this other vehicle,
I'd like the wheels transferred.

30:33.040 --> 30:36.542
- What other vehicle?
- They may be miraculous, the tyres.

30:37.085 --> 30:39.921
They've only had to be pumped up once
since 1964.

30:40.422 --> 30:43.341
- What other vehicle?
- They only cost me a fiver.

30:43.467 --> 30:45.786
Miss Shepherd,
you said about another vehicle?

30:45.886 --> 30:47.512
Hmm? Yeah, a van.

30:48.013 --> 30:49.347
Another van?

30:49.723 --> 30:50.765
Mmm.

30:51.850 --> 30:53.851
Well, a newer model.

30:54.686 --> 30:59.690
A titled Catholic lady says
she may get me one, as an act of charity.

31:00.943 --> 31:02.276
It's Lady Wiggin.

31:02.444 --> 31:05.446
- (SIGHS)
- Only she'd prefer to remain anonymous.

31:05.614 --> 31:09.450
I'll bet she would. So, why don't
you park it outside her house?

31:09.868 --> 31:12.370
- It's out of the question.
- There's plenty of room.

31:12.621 --> 31:14.956
- I have neighbours!
- So have I.

31:15.290 --> 31:18.543
So, should I not buy her another van?

31:19.378 --> 31:21.420
- (MUTTERS) Please your fucking self.
- What?

31:21.880 --> 31:24.882
Mr Bennett, I've worked it out.

31:26.051 --> 31:27.718
Mr Bennett.

31:29.638 --> 31:34.642
The ideal solution
would be off-street parking.

31:36.061 --> 31:39.397
You know, a driveway, possibly.

31:40.941 --> 31:42.275
So, what are you going to do?

31:47.447 --> 31:49.448
Play it by ear.

31:53.203 --> 31:54.287
Oh...

32:31.617 --> 32:33.784
Good evening to you, sir!

32:34.286 --> 32:36.271
I'm finding myself in the vicinity.

32:36.371 --> 32:39.665
I'm taking the opportunity
to pay my compliments to Margaret.

32:40.292 --> 32:43.461
- Margaret?
- An old friend from way back.

32:43.712 --> 32:44.837
You mean Miss Shepherd?

32:45.130 --> 32:47.131
Shepherd, is it? Very good.

32:47.966 --> 32:50.760
- Well, she'll be asleep.
- Of course.

32:50.969 --> 32:56.057
I'll bid you a good night, sir.
I'll call again when my schedule permits.

33:18.330 --> 33:20.164
Thank you.

- Never mind who I am. I've got your number!

Just clear off!
I live here, and I've got your number!

34:03.041 --> 34:05.710

Miss Shepherd, are you all right?

34:20.391 --> 34:23.393
Yes, yes. I think so.

34:24.062 --> 34:28.050
What was it about?
It wasn't the police, was it?

34:28.150 --> 34:33.362
No. They were louts, but if you choose
to live like this, it's what you must expect.

34:35.239 --> 34:40.244
I didn't choose. I was chosen.

34:43.581 --> 34:44.998
BENNETT: Well, that settles it.

34:45.833 --> 34:46.902
You think?

34:47.002 --> 34:50.170
I can't always be looking out for her.
I'm not her keeper.

34:50.505 --> 34:52.672
I mean, what happens to work?

34:55.010 --> 34:57.595
- I think she should either go or...
- Or what?

35:01.099 --> 35:05.019
Or bring the van into the drive,
where we can forget about her.

35:06.188 --> 35:08.397
Actually, that's why some men marry.

35:08.648 --> 35:11.317
So they don't have to think any more
about their wives.

35:11.526 --> 35:13.929
- That's not bad.
- Yes, except it's Proust.

35:14.029 --> 35:15.472
Oh, yes.

35:15.572 --> 35:18.532
And it'll only be for a few months,
until she decides where she's going.

35:20.660 --> 35:23.496
It'll be easier, but it's not kindness.

Only just.

38:20.715 --> 38:22.883
Put the van in your drive?

38:23.718 --> 38:26.220
That never occurred to me.

I don't know. I don't know.
It might not be convenient.

38:30.225 --> 38:32.961
No, I've thought it over.
Believe me, Miss Shepherd, it's all right.

38:33.061 --> 38:35.104
Just till you sort yourself out.

38:35.730 --> 38:39.066
Well, not convenient for you!
Convenient for me.

You're not doing me a favour, you know.
I have got other fish to fry.

38:45.907 --> 38:50.577
if I went south of the river,
I'd be welcomed with open arms.

38:55.417 --> 38:58.919
BENNETT: I was about to do her
a good turn, but, as ever,

38:59.379 --> 39:02.423
it was not without thoughts
of strangulation.

39:04.592 --> 39:07.261
She would come into the garden, yes,

39:07.595 --> 39:09.763
but only as a favour to me.

the handbrake with such determination

it can never afterwards be released.

40:15.830 --> 40:19.083
and it is seldom a tranquil
or a meditative process.

40:19.626 --> 40:21.627

...in possible light received.

she's wanting forgiveness for?

40:30.136 --> 40:31.678

40:31.846 --> 40:36.683
BENNETT: I used to pray myself
when I was young, but never like this.

40:38.353 --> 40:42.356
I'd never done anything,
but what has she done?

40:43.691 --> 40:45.343
Who's the old bat?

40:45.443 --> 40:47.444
Oh. She's a friend.

41:27.443 --> 41:28.569
did he have an earring?

41:28.903 --> 41:30.070
He did.

41:31.739 --> 41:33.740

who's been in London on a state visit.

41:43.543 --> 41:46.962
- Why didn't you tell me she was in the drive?
- I forgot.

41:47.505 --> 41:50.174

42:01.269 --> 42:03.937
This is London. Nobody thinks anything.

It's with her being a nun,
not having got off.

42:08.735 --> 42:10.068
They get thwarted.

Mind you, you're going down the same road.

42:21.623 --> 42:22.623
Me?

42:22.832 --> 42:27.502
No cloth on the table.
No holder for the toilet roll.

42:28.296 --> 42:31.548
Given time, I could have
this place spotless.

42:31.966 --> 42:33.008
You've got a home.

42:36.262 --> 42:37.804
You won't want to live here.

42:38.681 --> 42:40.015
(SIGHS) Oh.

42:42.477 --> 42:44.311
Where does she go to the lav?

42:44.604 --> 42:46.939
It has something to do with plastic bags.

42:47.148 --> 42:49.483
What sort of plastic bags?

42:49.817 --> 42:51.652
Stout ones, I hope.

42:52.153 --> 42:54.821
- You've not met her. Do you want to?
- Oh. No.

42:55.323 --> 43:00.478
No. With her being educated
I wouldn't know what to say.

43:00.578 --> 43:01.578
Oh.

43:09.337 --> 43:11.171
- Oh. Give us a kiss!
- Oh.

43:12.006 --> 43:14.841
- When will you be coming up next?
- Soon.

43:15.176 --> 43:16.843
The thing is

43:18.346 --> 43:21.682
I keep seeing a car in the car park.

43:21.975 --> 43:23.418
That's slightly to be expected, isn't it?

She should be in a home.

43:38.032 --> 43:40.701
- Where does she go to the lav?
- I told you.

43:40.994 --> 43:42.494
Looked after.

43:42.829 --> 43:46.331
A place where they'd wash her
and make her presentable.

I'm surprised they let her
roam the streets.

is gulled into devising a sentence

they have pronounced...

is much closer to being put in a home...

did he go behind the clouds?

44:23.911 --> 44:26.204
- Did he?
- I can't remember.

44:28.416 --> 44:31.376
He's a love, though. I know that.

- Bye, Mam.
- Bye.

You used to play the piano.

You told me.

I don't want to hear it, that's all!

Well, maybe she should.

49:46.942 --> 49:48.443
Well, I...

49:50.112 --> 49:54.574
I was once left alone in a room
in the convent.

49:56.285 --> 49:59.287
They didn't leave novices alone normally.

50:00.956 --> 50:03.291
And there was a piano there.

50:05.461 --> 50:08.129
I tried it, and it was open.

50:12.426 --> 50:14.302
It needed tuning.

50:16.138 --> 50:18.139
Some of the notes were dead.

50:21.143 --> 50:25.814

than any of the pianos I'd ever played.

50:45.167 --> 50:46.501
And then

50:47.962 --> 50:51.047
suddenly, the mistress
of the novices came in.

50:52.425 --> 50:56.037
Crept in, possibly, 'cause
I didn't hear her. She said...

50:56.137 --> 50:57.804
It's God's will.

50:57.930 --> 51:01.683
That was what God wanted.

couldn't I just play some hymns
for us to sing to?

51:10.526 --> 51:13.737

And I'd never make a nun if I argued.

while her derelict counterpart
resides in my garden.

Putting my mother in a home,
I see as some sort of failure.

- You had to have taken it.
- I have not.

52:45.412 --> 52:47.914

to have the car, so you've taken the key.

I ever touched her,

53:17.278 --> 53:22.240

but because she seemed mad.

But she's still on the loose.

54:17.463 --> 54:20.298
Of course, whether she's all there or not
is anyone's guess.

You know, I don't like
the three-wheeler standing in the street.

You see, if you pushed the van
in front of your window,

54:32.645 --> 54:35.089
I could get the Reliant
in there on the drive.

54:35.189 --> 54:36.272
There's tons of room.

54:36.440 --> 54:39.025
So, I have the van and the Reliant.

54:39.652 --> 54:42.820
Yeah, I've had guidance
that's where it should be.

you don't want the social worker.

55:09.056 --> 55:11.265
Didn't you know her name was Mary?

55:11.558 --> 55:14.060
Well, I suppose I did.
I always call her Miss Shepherd.

55:14.353 --> 55:16.020
We all have names.

55:16.522 --> 55:19.023

and she called you by yours,

55:19.942 --> 55:21.051
"Alan", "Mary",

55:21.151 --> 55:22.970
you never know, it might be easier
to talk things through.

55:23.070 --> 55:25.514
Through? There is no through.

How do you talk things through
with someone

55:27.241 --> 55:29.518

with the Virgin Mary?

55:29.618 --> 55:32.412
You talk things through
with Isaiah Berlin, maybe,

55:32.579 --> 55:35.232
who, in comparison with Miss Shepherd,
is a man of few words.

55:35.332 --> 55:38.334
You do not talk things through with her
because you don't get through.

Alan, I'm getting a bit of hostility here.

a steep learning curve.

55:45.259 --> 55:47.912
No. It is not a steep learning curve.

55:48.012 --> 55:50.388
I've never been
on a so-called learning curve.

56:09.825 --> 56:12.686
Well, I have her down as Mary.

01:00:29.543 --> 01:00:30.668
RUFUS: Don't you believe it.

01:00:30.794 --> 01:00:35.131
That's what happens in plays.
In life, going downhill is an uphill job.

01:00:36.925 --> 01:00:38.535
How's your mother?

01:00:38.635 --> 01:00:42.305
Oh, same. Sits. Smiles. Sleeps.

01:00:45.684 --> 01:00:46.726
Oh.

01:00:47.894 --> 01:00:49.270
Are you all right?

01:00:50.772 --> 01:00:53.717
Me? Yes, why?
I'm just going to the theatre.

01:00:53.817 --> 01:00:56.819
- Not upset about your play?
- No.

01:00:57.404 --> 01:00:59.640
I read a good review the other day.

01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:02.158
- I was told they were all good.
- They are, I'm sure.

01:01:02.409 --> 01:01:03.769
We enjoyed it.

01:01:03.869 --> 01:01:06.980
Though I hadn't realised it was just
going to be you and nobody else.

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:09.066
Well, yes. It's a monologue.

01:01:09.166 --> 01:01:11.000
(CHUCKLES) Yes, I suppose.

01:01:11.501 --> 01:01:13.502
I'm just amazed how you remember it all.

01:01:14.087 --> 01:01:17.157
The review I read
was particularly perceptive about you.

01:01:17.257 --> 01:01:19.159
Really? Saying what?

01:01:19.259 --> 01:01:20.926
That you couldn't make your mind up.

01:01:21.094 --> 01:01:23.512
- About what?
- Anything, really.

01:01:24.264 --> 01:01:26.432
It meant in a good way!

01:01:26.808 --> 01:01:28.142
Thanks.

01:01:30.395 --> 01:01:34.341
Actually, I couldn't make it out at all.
What was it about?

01:01:34.441 --> 01:01:37.177
Him, as usual. Not coming clean.

01:01:37.277 --> 01:01:38.845
- PAULINE: What about?
- What do you think?

01:01:38.945 --> 01:01:39.945
Oh.

01:01:40.781 --> 01:01:43.183
(AUDIENCE LAUGHING)

01:01:43.283 --> 01:01:47.578
BENNETT: And when I came down again,
she's still sat there, hat and coat on.

01:01:48.205 --> 01:01:53.376
She said, "Graham, my one aim
in life is for you to be happy."

01:01:53.919 --> 01:01:55.070
And execute 45.

01:01:55.170 --> 01:01:57.698
BENNETT: "If I thought that by dying
it would make you happy, I would."

01:01:57.798 --> 01:01:58.740
Go.

01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:00.242
BENNETT: I said, "Mam,

01:02:00.342 --> 01:02:03.719
"your dying wouldn't make me happy.
In fact, the reverse.

01:02:03.845 --> 01:02:07.723
"It would make me unhappy.
Anyway, Mam, you're not going to die."

01:02:08.141 --> 01:02:11.644
She said, "No, I'm not going to die.

01:02:12.062 --> 01:02:13.714
"I'm going to get married."

01:02:13.814 --> 01:02:16.399
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHING)
- "The honeymoon is in Tenerife.

01:02:16.900 --> 01:02:18.526
"Have one of your tablets."

01:02:19.111 --> 01:02:21.112
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)

01:02:29.746 --> 01:02:33.416
BENNETT: So, for the umpteenth time,
I biked back from the theatre

01:02:33.583 --> 01:02:35.835
where I'd been talking about my mother.

01:02:37.421 --> 01:02:39.922
Well, at least I know where my mother is.

01:02:45.262 --> 01:02:46.595
- Miss Shepherd.
- (KNOCKS ON WINDOW)

01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:53.477
Miss Shepherd?

01:02:59.693 --> 01:03:00.860
I don't like it.

01:03:01.778 --> 01:03:03.779
- So, look in.
- No.

01:03:04.114 --> 01:03:06.350
- Are you scared?
- No.

01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:07.517
Not of the body.

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:11.537
Scared this may be the end of the story,
and now I'm going to have to write it.

01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:14.957
Still, now she's gone.

01:03:15.459 --> 01:03:17.126
I can make it up.

01:03:17.461 --> 01:03:20.379
Narrative freedom. Whoopee.

01:03:23.633 --> 01:03:24.967
Miss Shepherd.

01:03:27.971 --> 01:03:30.014
- Miss Shepherd?
- Go on.

01:03:37.439 --> 01:03:40.050
(SHOUTING) What are you doing?
Looking at my things?

01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:42.302
I thought you might be ill or dead.

01:03:42.402 --> 01:03:44.554
- Dead? Me?
- I was concerned.

01:03:44.654 --> 01:03:45.889
You were nosy!

01:03:45.989 --> 01:03:47.057
I haven't seen you. I'm sorry.

01:03:47.157 --> 01:03:49.476
I'm not dead! You'll know when I'm dead.

01:03:49.576 --> 01:03:50.743
I'm sorry.

01:03:50.869 --> 01:03:54.371
Dead? Me?
I shan't die in a hurry, I can tell you.

01:03:54.831 --> 01:03:56.165
Dead?

01:03:57.167 --> 01:03:59.168
Don't make me laugh.

01:03:59.628 --> 01:04:00.711
(SCOFFS)

01:04:01.838 --> 01:04:05.007
BENNETT: She didn't die then,
and nor did my mother.

01:04:05.759 --> 01:04:09.762
But as the years passed,
both of them were beginning to fade.

01:04:10.013 --> 01:04:12.999
As you can appreciate,
it's difficult to take a history.

01:04:13.099 --> 01:04:15.419
But I'm right in thinking
she hasn't been a smoker?

01:04:15.519 --> 01:04:18.854
- No.
- Not been a smoker, doesn't drink.

01:04:19.689 --> 01:04:21.815
All things considered,
a very healthy woman.

01:04:23.026 --> 01:04:24.026
You think?

01:04:34.037 --> 01:04:36.372
This is a woman who's broken her hip.

01:04:37.123 --> 01:04:40.402
And of course, in someone younger
and in better circumstances,

01:04:40.502 --> 01:04:42.545
we'd give them antibiotics.

01:04:43.213 --> 01:04:46.799
But at your mother's age,
and in her state of mind,

01:04:47.551 --> 01:04:50.386
one wonders if this is altogether kind.

01:04:51.888 --> 01:04:54.682
And if you don't give her antibiotics,
what will happen?

01:04:54.975 --> 01:04:56.642
She may recover.

01:04:57.310 --> 01:04:58.644
Or not.

01:04:59.062 --> 01:05:01.397
She could just sleep away.

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:05.234
You mustn't reproach yourself.

01:05:06.486 --> 01:05:07.820
You've done

01:05:09.072 --> 01:05:11.490
more than can be expected.

01:05:17.998 --> 01:05:18.998
BENNETT: Thank you.

01:05:20.458 --> 01:05:21.500
MISS SHEPHERD: Oh.

01:05:22.085 --> 01:05:23.419
Mr Bennett.

01:05:24.254 --> 01:05:26.088
- Where have you been?
- BENNETT: Seeing my mother.

01:05:26.339 --> 01:05:27.673
Oh. How is she?

01:05:28.925 --> 01:05:31.010
The same. She doesn't remember me now.

01:05:31.177 --> 01:05:34.179
Well, I'm not surprised.
She doesn't see you very often.

01:05:35.265 --> 01:05:37.266
Will you write about me?

01:05:38.268 --> 01:05:39.435
I don't know.

01:05:40.270 --> 01:05:41.478
She never said this.

01:05:41.771 --> 01:05:42.756
So?

01:05:42.856 --> 01:05:43.840
(MISS SHEPHERD CHUCKLES)

01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:46.692
Oh. I've heard you. On the wireless.

01:05:46.943 --> 01:05:48.319
Does she know that?

01:05:48.945 --> 01:05:51.030
Well, how can she?
She doesn't know who she is.

01:05:51.448 --> 01:05:55.618
Yeah, that's what you think.
Using your mother.

01:05:56.453 --> 01:05:58.370
You should be ashamed of yourself.

01:05:58.788 --> 01:06:00.122
She didn't say this.

01:06:00.624 --> 01:06:03.542
No. But why shouldn't she?

01:06:04.419 --> 01:06:08.047
You write about her all the time,
one way or another.

01:06:08.381 --> 01:06:10.033
You use your mother.

01:06:10.133 --> 01:06:12.051
That's what writers do.

01:06:12.469 --> 01:06:15.429
Me next, I suppose.

01:06:15.805 --> 01:06:19.808
Anyway, now you're here,
I need some shopping done.

01:06:20.644 --> 01:06:22.879
You ought to go yourself.
You should try and walk more.

01:06:22.979 --> 01:06:24.396
- I do walk.
- I never see you.

01:06:24.522 --> 01:06:27.024
Well, that's 'cause you're not around
in the middle of the night.

01:06:27.651 --> 01:06:28.984
I want some batteries.

01:06:29.611 --> 01:06:30.903
And some sherbet lemons.

01:06:31.738 --> 01:06:33.489
- Mr Bennett?
- Yes?

01:06:35.158 --> 01:06:38.160
Would you like to push me up the street?

01:06:40.330 --> 01:06:41.955
Not particularly, no.

01:07:00.350 --> 01:07:02.794
This'll do. Turn me 'round.
Turn me 'round!

01:07:02.894 --> 01:07:03.894
All right.

01:07:04.729 --> 01:07:05.771
(MISS SHEPHERD CHUCKLES)

01:07:07.399 --> 01:07:09.108
Whee!

01:07:09.693 --> 01:07:10.984
(LAUGHS)

01:07:16.199 --> 01:07:17.533
BENNETT: Careful!

01:07:17.784 --> 01:07:19.451

(CONTINUES COUGHING)

01:07:34.551 --> 01:07:35.884
BENNETT: Are you all right?

01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:40.055
Yes, I think so. (CHUCKLES)

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:42.375
Would you like me to make you
a cup of coffee?

01:07:42.475 --> 01:07:43.668
No.

01:07:43.768 --> 01:07:47.312
No, I don't want you to go to all that
trouble. I'll just have half a cup.

01:07:53.486 --> 01:07:54.486
Oh!

01:07:55.739 --> 01:07:57.531
I have to go to mass.

01:07:57.657 --> 01:07:59.742
- Well, you're not fit.
- Here.

01:07:59.909 --> 01:08:02.729
It's an anniversary
and a day of obligation.

01:08:02.829 --> 01:08:05.315
Oh? Who for? A saint?

01:08:05.415 --> 01:08:07.400
No. A young man.

01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:09.027
Oh? Someone you loved?

01:08:09.127 --> 01:08:11.462
No! Certainly not. Just someone I...

01:08:12.589 --> 01:08:14.423
Someone who died.

01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:17.926
He'd be in his 50s now.

01:08:18.261 --> 01:08:19.412
Was he a Catholic?

01:08:19.511 --> 01:08:23.348
Possibly, possibly. Only he's in purgatory.
He needs my prayers.

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:25.184
What was his name?

01:08:25.435 --> 01:08:27.770
No, I never bother with names.

01:08:29.773 --> 01:08:31.439
The body of Christ.

01:08:37.572 --> 01:08:38.572
PRIEST: The body of Christ.

01:08:42.618 --> 01:08:44.536
- Yes?
- I live down the street.

01:08:45.537 --> 01:08:46.955
I've seen you.

01:08:51.127 --> 01:08:52.544
It's you that has the van.

01:08:52.879 --> 01:08:54.087
Yes.

01:08:54.881 --> 01:08:56.173
Difficult woman.

01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:58.050
A Catholic.

01:08:59.135 --> 01:09:01.303
One of the sisters remembers her.

01:09:02.305 --> 01:09:07.475
I've been told she was very argumentative.
Is that why she was made to leave?

01:09:08.144 --> 01:09:09.812
Disputatious, she was.

01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:13.439
I've had her pointed out to me
on that account, hankering after the piano.

01:09:13.566 --> 01:09:14.968
She always thought she was right.

01:09:15.068 --> 01:09:17.819
She wasn't right.
God is right. End of story.

01:09:18.904 --> 01:09:20.572
Anyway, what do you want to know for?

01:09:20.698 --> 01:09:23.408
- She's ill.
- Who? The woman?

01:09:23.576 --> 01:09:27.037
I wondered if there was a nun available
who could talk to her, do her some shopping.

01:09:27.663 --> 01:09:29.997
We don't have shopping nuns.

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:32.167
It's a strict order.

01:09:32.502 --> 01:09:33.694
I've seen them shopping.

01:09:33.795 --> 01:09:36.462
I saw one yesterday at Marks & Spencer.
She was buying meringues.

01:09:37.506 --> 01:09:39.091
The Bishop may have been coming.

01:09:39.676 --> 01:09:41.051
Well, does he like meringues?

01:09:41.845 --> 01:09:45.999
Who are you, coming 'round,
asking if the Bishop likes meringues?

01:09:46.099 --> 01:09:47.349
Are you a communist?

01:09:47.684 --> 01:09:50.769
She's ill. She's a Catholic,
and I think she might be dying.

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:54.064
Well, they can pray for her,
only you'll have to fill in a form.

01:09:55.024 --> 01:09:57.442
She'll probably pull her socks up
once your back is turned.

01:09:57.569 --> 01:10:01.071
That's been my experience
where invalids are concerned.

01:10:02.365 --> 01:10:03.866
This way out!

01:10:04.701 --> 01:10:07.536
I don't want you bumping into the sisters.

01:10:14.127 --> 01:10:15.127
Oh!

01:10:29.267 --> 01:10:31.643
Another parcel on the path.

01:10:33.104 --> 01:10:38.108
If... When I write about all this,
people will say there's too much about shit.

01:10:40.528 --> 01:10:44.781
BENNETT: But there was a lot about shit.
Shit was in the forefront.

01:10:45.116 --> 01:10:47.393
Caring, which is not a word I like,

01:10:47.493 --> 01:10:49.953
caring is about shit.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:56.043
(SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

01:11:06.763 --> 01:11:08.706
- MISS BRISCOE: I've talked to Mary.
- BENNETT: Or Margaret.

01:11:08.806 --> 01:11:10.140
MISS BRISCOE: Or Margaret.

01:11:10.391 --> 01:11:12.085
Miss Shepherd, anyway.

01:11:12.185 --> 01:11:16.130
She tells me you don't encourage her to get
out and lead a more purposeful life,

01:11:16.230 --> 01:11:17.731
and put obstacles in her way.

01:11:17.982 --> 01:11:20.134
I don't encourage her to think
she can become prime minister.

01:11:20.234 --> 01:11:22.736
I do encourage her
to try and get to the supermarket.

01:11:23.237 --> 01:11:26.558
Yes. A carer will often feel that...

01:11:26.658 --> 01:11:30.744
Excuse me, may I stop you?
Do not call me the carer. I am not the carer.

01:11:31.162 --> 01:11:34.039
I hate caring. I hate the thought.
I hate the word.

01:11:34.374 --> 01:11:39.586
I do not care, and I do not care for.
I am here, she is there. There is no caring.

01:11:40.004 --> 01:11:43.966
Alan, I'm sensing hostility again.

01:11:45.176 --> 01:11:48.553
You see, I'm wondering
whether having cared for Mary,

01:11:48.763 --> 01:11:51.390
as it were, singlehanded
for all these years,

01:11:52.183 --> 01:11:55.686
you don't understandably resent it
when the professionals lend a hand.

01:11:56.020 --> 01:11:57.130
No, though I resent it

01:11:57.230 --> 01:11:59.564
when the professionals
turn up every three months or so

01:11:59.774 --> 01:12:01.942
and try to tell me what this woman,

01:12:02.193 --> 01:12:06.363
whom I have coped with on a daily basis
for the past 15 years, is like.

01:12:06.698 --> 01:12:08.573
What is she like?

01:12:09.033 --> 01:12:14.079
Mary, as you call her, is a bigoted,
blinkered, cantankerous, devious,

01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:18.166
unforgiving, self-serving,
rank, rude, car-mad cow.

01:12:18.459 --> 01:12:21.070
Which is to say nothing
of her flying faeces

01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:23.615
and her ability to extrude
from her withered buttocks

01:12:23.715 --> 01:12:26.993
turds of such force that they land
a yard from the back of the van

01:12:27.093 --> 01:12:29.553
and their presumed point of exit.

01:12:30.763 --> 01:12:33.181
Though, of course,
you didn't say any of that.

01:12:37.603 --> 01:12:39.521
People will think
it's because you're too nice.

01:12:40.481 --> 01:12:42.399
It's actually because you're too timid.

01:12:42.650 --> 01:12:45.652
Yes. Though this being England,
timid is good, too.

01:12:48.114 --> 01:12:50.949
Well, this has been very helpful.

01:12:51.576 --> 01:12:54.077
I'll see about getting her a doctor.

01:12:55.413 --> 01:12:57.581
Is it a man doctor?

01:12:57.832 --> 01:12:58.999
Yes.

01:13:02.754 --> 01:13:07.116
I don't want a man doctor.
Don't they have a woman?

01:13:07.216 --> 01:13:10.510
Sorry. Miss Shepherd,
I only want to take your pulse.

01:13:12.430 --> 01:13:15.098
- Which hand? Do you have a preference?
- No.

01:13:17.643 --> 01:13:18.727
Ah.

01:13:21.105 --> 01:13:23.440
It's normally cleaner than that.

01:13:25.610 --> 01:13:28.262
Miss Shepherd, I'd like to take you
to hospital for a day or so,

01:13:28.362 --> 01:13:29.696
just to run some tests.

01:13:29.947 --> 01:13:33.283
No, I've always had great faith in onions.

01:13:33.534 --> 01:13:34.701
Yes.

01:13:35.119 --> 01:13:38.955
But onions can only take you so far,
medically speaking.

01:13:44.003 --> 01:13:45.613
She won't go to hospital.

01:13:45.713 --> 01:13:48.006
- MISS BRISCOE: How do you know?
- Ask her.

01:13:48.633 --> 01:13:51.426
Would she go to the day centre?
She could be looked at there.

01:13:51.803 --> 01:13:53.637
And she could stay for a few days.

01:13:53.888 --> 01:13:55.889
She won't go to the day centre.

01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:57.474
MISS BRISCOE: Are you sure?

01:13:57.725 --> 01:13:59.059
Have you asked her?

01:13:59.602 --> 01:14:03.271
She will not go to the day centre. I know.

01:14:03.481 --> 01:14:05.023
MISS SHEPHERD: Of course I'll go.

01:14:06.901 --> 01:14:08.652
They won't make me stay in?

01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:11.264
No, they're going to give you a bath
and put you in some clean clothes

01:14:11.364 --> 01:14:12.531
and do some tests.

01:14:12.824 --> 01:14:14.199
Will they leave me to it?

01:14:14.492 --> 01:14:16.326
- Where?
- In the bath.

01:14:16.661 --> 01:14:20.997
I know how to bath myself.
I've won awards for that.

01:14:21.332 --> 01:14:22.483
Yes, I remember.

01:14:22.583 --> 01:14:23.917
- MISS SHEPHERD: Mr Bennett.
- Yes?

01:14:24.168 --> 01:14:27.712
It won't look
as if I'm being taken away, will it?

01:14:27.839 --> 01:14:29.506
Taken away where?

01:14:29.757 --> 01:14:34.162
Where they take people
because they're not right.

01:14:34.262 --> 01:14:35.595
Do they do that still?

01:14:35.763 --> 01:14:37.848
Well, sometimes,
but you need a lot of signatures.

01:14:38.057 --> 01:14:40.809
But they pretend things
to get you there sometimes.

01:14:41.018 --> 01:14:45.021
That's the danger with next of kin.
It's one of their tricks.

01:14:46.107 --> 01:14:48.275
They might be pretending
it's a day centre.

01:14:48.693 --> 01:14:50.527
- No.
- Well, I...

01:14:50.778 --> 01:14:53.431
I've been had like that once before.

01:14:53.531 --> 01:14:54.865
Alan.

01:14:58.786 --> 01:15:00.354
AMBULANCE MAN: Miss Shepherd.

01:15:00.454 --> 01:15:04.875
Now, I'm a bit behindhand with things,
so there may be a bit of a...

01:15:05.751 --> 01:15:07.586
- Put your arm around my neck.
- Oh!

01:15:09.338 --> 01:15:10.672
There we go.

01:15:11.382 --> 01:15:14.217
I've not gone in for this kind
of thing much.

01:15:14.844 --> 01:15:17.512
BENNETT: I note how,
with none of my own distaste,

01:15:17.638 --> 01:15:20.958
the ambulance driver does not hesitate
to touch Miss Shepherd,

01:15:21.058 --> 01:15:24.895
and even puts his arm around her
as he lowers her into the chair.

01:15:28.149 --> 01:15:32.402
I note, too, his careful rearrangement
of her greasy clothing,

01:15:32.904 --> 01:15:37.574
pulling the skirt down over her knees
in the interest of modesty.

01:15:41.245 --> 01:15:43.246
I'm coming back, you know.

01:15:43.581 --> 01:15:45.749
This isn't a toe in the water job.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.251
Is there anything you'd like us to take
and have us wash?

01:15:48.586 --> 01:15:51.755
Well, why? Most of my things are clean.

01:15:52.506 --> 01:15:54.174
PAULINE: Not ill, your friend?

01:15:54.342 --> 01:15:56.509
- BENNETT: No.
- Not going?

01:15:56.677 --> 01:16:00.138
- Only to the day centre, apparently.
- RUFUS: Oh.

01:16:00.264 --> 01:16:02.432
The children always ask after her.

01:16:03.184 --> 01:16:05.727
They used to be so frightened of her
when they were young.

01:16:05.937 --> 01:16:09.314
One's in Washington now. The World Bank.

01:16:10.650 --> 01:16:13.276
MRS VAUGHAN: How long has it been?
Ten years?

01:16:13.945 --> 01:16:15.779
- More like 15.
- A lifetime.

01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:18.073
Mr Bennett. Mr Bennett.

01:16:21.702 --> 01:16:24.355
That social worker wanted to know
my next of kin.

01:16:24.455 --> 01:16:29.334
I don't want my next of kin broadcast,
so I said I didn't have any.

01:16:29.794 --> 01:16:31.461
Only, they're in this envelope.

01:16:31.796 --> 01:16:34.714
And you keep it under your hat.

01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:39.302
Do you know
I was an ambulance driver myself once?

01:16:39.845 --> 01:16:41.471
During the war.

01:16:41.889 --> 01:16:44.641
I knew Kensington in the blackout.

01:16:44.809 --> 01:16:46.184
- Oh. Really?
- Mmm.

01:16:50.815 --> 01:16:53.024
BENNETT: The chair goes up on a lift.

01:16:53.484 --> 01:16:55.553
And in this small ascension,

01:16:55.653 --> 01:16:59.307
when she slowly rises
above the level of the garden wall,

01:16:59.407 --> 01:17:01.700
there is a vagabond nobility about her.

01:17:02.994 --> 01:17:05.996
A derelict Nobel Prize winner, she looks,

01:17:06.330 --> 01:17:10.667
her grimy face set
in a kind of resigned satisfaction.

01:17:11.544 --> 01:17:15.005
Could we do that again?
I'd like another go.

01:17:15.298 --> 01:17:16.949
When you come back.

01:17:17.049 --> 01:17:18.133
Ooh.

01:17:44.201 --> 01:17:45.535
Here we go.

01:17:57.423 --> 01:17:58.715
You smell lovely.

01:17:59.550 --> 01:18:01.160
- You okay?
- Yes.

01:18:01.260 --> 01:18:02.260
Good.

01:18:07.391 --> 01:18:09.726
There. Your M.O.T.

01:18:20.571 --> 01:18:21.988
There you go.

01:18:25.618 --> 01:18:27.535
Hello, Margaret.

01:18:49.266 --> 01:18:52.936
MR FAIRCHILD: Fourteen years?
You must be a saint.

01:18:53.771 --> 01:18:58.274
She's a difficult woman, my sister.
Edith won't have her in the house.

01:18:58.609 --> 01:19:01.111
I used to help her out when I could.

01:19:01.612 --> 01:19:03.613
It's what Mother would have wanted.

01:19:03.948 --> 01:19:06.116
I'm not a saint, just lazy.

01:19:06.367 --> 01:19:08.701
- I know she was an ambulance driver.
- Yes.

01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:12.872
And she was a nun. Twice over.
Till they got rid of her. (CHUCKLES)

01:19:14.667 --> 01:19:16.418
Tipped her over the edge.

01:19:17.795 --> 01:19:20.630
She spent some time in an asylum.

01:19:21.674 --> 01:19:22.966
Banstead.

01:19:25.052 --> 01:19:26.386
Which was my fault.

01:19:26.804 --> 01:19:27.955
No.

01:19:28.055 --> 01:19:29.681
Mind you, she's a difficult woman.

01:19:30.307 --> 01:19:31.474
Such a bully.

01:19:32.309 --> 01:19:34.644
Did she bully you? She bullies me.

01:19:34.812 --> 01:19:36.646
Well, I had her put away.

01:19:37.481 --> 01:19:39.149
Incarcerated.

01:19:40.317 --> 01:19:42.652
Sectioned is what you'd call it today.

01:19:43.154 --> 01:19:44.654
Mind you, she got away from them, too.

01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:47.449
- Oh!
- Gave them the slip, ended up in the van.

01:19:47.575 --> 01:19:48.700
(CHUCKLES)

01:19:49.326 --> 01:19:52.328
Does she still play? Piano?

01:19:52.913 --> 01:19:54.164
No.

01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:56.166
Oh.

01:19:57.334 --> 01:19:58.918
That is sad.

01:20:00.713 --> 01:20:02.297
Have you heard of Cortot?

01:20:02.423 --> 01:20:05.884
Alfred Cortot, the virtuoso pianist?

01:20:08.053 --> 01:20:09.163
Yes.

01:20:09.263 --> 01:20:12.182
Margaret was his pupil.

01:20:13.058 --> 01:20:15.894
Yeah, she had to go over
to Paris for lessons.

01:20:16.228 --> 01:20:18.104
It wasn't easy in those days.

01:20:18.355 --> 01:20:23.026
And practise. Oh. My word,
she used to practise all day long.

01:20:23.527 --> 01:20:26.029
Well, the nuns put a stop to that.

01:20:27.198 --> 01:20:29.199
Test of obedience.

01:20:30.117 --> 01:20:36.039
I was a vet in Africa, and when I came back,
the music was out. Finished.

01:20:39.543 --> 01:20:42.128
Practising had become praying.

01:20:42.254 --> 01:20:44.339
(ORCHESTRA PLAYING)

01:20:45.174 --> 01:20:46.257
Hmm.

01:20:51.514 --> 01:20:52.931
(PIANO PLAYING)

01:20:54.475 --> 01:20:56.476
Played at the Proms once.

01:22:15.681 --> 01:22:16.973
(BREATH TREMBLING)

01:23:13.530 --> 01:23:15.573
(PLAYING PIANO)

01:25:28.999 --> 01:25:30.333
Miss Shepherd?

01:25:37.174 --> 01:25:38.257
(KNOCKS ON WINDOW)

01:25:39.009 --> 01:25:40.426
BENNETT: Miss Shepherd?

01:25:41.345 --> 01:25:42.845
(VAN DOOR OPENS)

01:25:48.602 --> 01:25:50.603
I just tried to visit you.

01:25:54.024 --> 01:25:56.025
MISS SHEPHERD: I wasn't stopping there.

01:25:56.360 --> 01:26:01.197
A woman said my face rang a bell.
Was I ever in Banstead?

01:26:01.698 --> 01:26:03.866
And she would not stop.

01:26:04.201 --> 01:26:06.452
They gave me some mince and she said,

01:26:06.703 --> 01:26:09.982
"You'll find the mince here
a step up from the mince in Banstead."

01:26:10.082 --> 01:26:11.666
I don't know about the...

01:26:12.125 --> 01:26:15.753
The mince in Banstead,
or anywhere else, for that matter.

01:26:15.879 --> 01:26:18.464
That's just where they put people
when they're not right.

01:26:19.299 --> 01:26:21.300
Well, you look nice and clean.

01:26:21.802 --> 01:26:24.303
Yeah, well, that'll be the bath.

01:26:24.763 --> 01:26:26.540
They let me do it myself.

01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:30.685
The nurse came and gave me
some finishing touches.

01:26:31.436 --> 01:26:33.646
She said I'd come up a treat.

01:26:36.400 --> 01:26:37.859
I bought you these.

01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:39.652
Flowers?

01:26:40.654 --> 01:26:42.947
What do I want with flowers?

01:26:43.699 --> 01:26:45.449
They... They only die.

01:26:46.994 --> 01:26:50.121
I've got enough on my plate
without flowers.

01:26:50.831 --> 01:26:52.957
Why, you won't often
have been given flowers.

01:26:55.544 --> 01:26:56.961
Who says?

01:27:00.173 --> 01:27:03.593
I've had bigger flowers than these.

01:27:04.595 --> 01:27:06.512
And with ribbons on.

01:27:07.806 --> 01:27:09.348
These don't compare.

01:27:13.353 --> 01:27:14.770
Music.

01:27:20.819 --> 01:27:24.572
(STAMMERS) How are people
supposed to avoid it?

01:27:26.658 --> 01:27:30.369
You see, I had it at my fingertips.

01:27:31.788 --> 01:27:34.290
I had it in my bones.

01:27:37.502 --> 01:27:39.503
I could play in the dark.

01:27:41.340 --> 01:27:43.341
Had to sometimes.

01:27:44.343 --> 01:27:46.344
And the keys were

01:27:48.055 --> 01:27:49.680
like rooms.

01:27:51.934 --> 01:27:55.311
C major and D minor.

01:27:56.521 --> 01:28:00.066
Dark rooms and light rooms.

01:28:02.486 --> 01:28:04.820
Just like a mansion

01:28:06.281 --> 01:28:07.990
to me, music.

01:28:10.827 --> 01:28:13.204
Only it worried me,

01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:18.042
that playing came easier than praying.

01:28:18.377 --> 01:28:19.669
And I...

01:28:20.295 --> 01:28:23.714
I said this, which may have been an error.

01:28:26.385 --> 01:28:28.052
Said it to whom?

01:28:31.682 --> 01:28:33.307
My confessor.

01:28:34.851 --> 01:28:36.185
He said

01:28:36.979 --> 01:28:40.606
that was another vent
the devil could creep through.

01:28:43.402 --> 01:28:45.987
So, he outlawed the piano.

01:28:46.321 --> 01:28:48.489
Put paid to music generally.

01:28:51.368 --> 01:28:54.412
Said dividends would accrue in terms of

01:28:55.622 --> 01:28:57.707
growth of the spirit.

01:28:59.751 --> 01:29:02.086
Which they did.

01:29:04.256 --> 01:29:05.589
They did.

01:29:16.226 --> 01:29:17.643
How's your mother?

01:29:19.771 --> 01:29:21.272
Oh. The same.

01:29:21.606 --> 01:29:23.383
Still in the coma?

01:29:23.483 --> 01:29:24.483
No.

01:29:25.569 --> 01:29:28.347
She's just getting a bit of shut-eye.

01:29:28.447 --> 01:29:29.905
People do.

01:29:32.367 --> 01:29:33.769
Well, good night.

01:29:33.869 --> 01:29:34.910
Mr Bennett?

01:29:39.791 --> 01:29:41.584
Hold my hand.

01:29:43.462 --> 01:29:45.296
It's clean.

01:30:17.704 --> 01:30:20.899
BENNETT: So much of what
this woman's life had been,

01:30:20.999 --> 01:30:23.334
I found out only after her death.

01:30:24.169 --> 01:30:27.838
So, to tell her story,
I have occasionally had to invent,

01:30:28.048 --> 01:30:30.925
though much of it one could not make up.

01:30:31.426 --> 01:30:36.097
And I do not make it up when I say
that it was on the morning after this talk,

01:30:36.348 --> 01:30:39.183
when she lay in the van
with her hair washed,

01:30:39.601 --> 01:30:43.422
that on that same morning
comes the social worker into the garden,

01:30:43.522 --> 01:30:49.110
bearing clean clothes, linen and ointment
and knocks on the door of the van.

01:31:24.688 --> 01:31:26.856
It is a van no longer.

01:31:27.232 --> 01:31:29.024
It is a sepulchre.

01:31:31.903 --> 01:31:33.737
Can I use your phone?

01:31:34.197 --> 01:31:36.031
Yes. Yes, of course.

01:31:45.917 --> 01:31:50.045
BENNETT: Even now, I do not venture
into this evil-smelling tomb.

01:31:50.755 --> 01:31:55.843
But I feel cheated that the discovery
of the body has not actually been mine

01:31:56.136 --> 01:31:59.388
and that having observed so much
for so long,

01:31:59.848 --> 01:32:02.266
I am not the first to witness her death.

01:32:03.685 --> 01:32:05.644
Now, in quick succession,

01:32:05.854 --> 01:32:10.149
come the doctor,
the priest and men from the undertaker's

01:32:10.442 --> 01:32:14.778
all of whom do what no one else has done
for 20 years.

01:32:15.780 --> 01:32:18.517
Namely, without pause

01:32:18.617 --> 01:32:23.495
and seemingly without distaste,
step inside the van.

01:32:25.707 --> 01:32:28.876
PRIEST: Lord grant her everlasting rest

01:32:29.211 --> 01:32:32.588
and let perpetual light shine upon her.

01:32:33.298 --> 01:32:36.634
Present her to God the Most High.

01:32:44.309 --> 01:32:46.810
(WHISPERS) She's gone, then, the lady.

01:32:48.313 --> 01:32:50.981
He'll know. She'll have told him.

01:32:52.317 --> 01:32:54.818
Only they got to keep mum, vicars.

01:32:55.237 --> 01:32:58.364
No helping the police
with their enquiries.

01:32:59.157 --> 01:33:00.976
Did you know she was on the run?

01:33:01.076 --> 01:33:02.159
Miss Shepherd?

01:33:02.827 --> 01:33:05.287
Miss whatever you call her, yeah.

01:33:05.664 --> 01:33:07.732
Stationary at a junction,

01:33:07.832 --> 01:33:09.192
a young lad on a motorbike

01:33:09.292 --> 01:33:10.902
comes 'round a corner too fast...

01:33:11.002 --> 01:33:12.028
- (CRASHES)
- (GASPS)

01:33:12.128 --> 01:33:14.338
UNDERWOOD: And smashes into her vehicle.

01:33:15.006 --> 01:33:16.548
Not her fault.

01:33:16.675 --> 01:33:20.678
Only here's a dead boy on the road
who she thinks she's killed.

01:33:22.013 --> 01:33:25.083
Does she call the police?
Flag down a fellow motorist? Oh, no.

01:33:25.183 --> 01:33:26.976
She clears off pronto.

01:33:27.269 --> 01:33:30.771
Thereby putting herself
on the wrong side of the law.

01:33:31.022 --> 01:33:33.148
So, you blackmailed her.

01:33:33.525 --> 01:33:35.776
I'm a policeman, Mr Bennett.

01:33:36.361 --> 01:33:39.613
Retired, of course.
We don't do things like that.

01:33:49.541 --> 01:33:52.543
Well, it's a cut above
her previous vehicle.

01:33:54.421 --> 01:33:57.490
BENNETT: All those years,
stood on my doorstep,

01:33:57.590 --> 01:33:59.383
she was outside the law.

01:34:01.052 --> 01:34:04.430
A life, this is what I keep thinking,

01:34:04.723 --> 01:34:08.183
a life beside which mine is just dull.

01:34:17.902 --> 01:34:23.490
Left to my own thoughts at the graveside,
one of the undertaker's men takes the eye.

01:34:23.908 --> 01:34:28.370
Not an occupation one drifts into,
I imagine, undertaking.

01:34:29.205 --> 01:34:31.566
Mr Bennett. Excuse me.

01:34:31.666 --> 01:34:34.585
I'm supposed to be the centrepiece here.

01:34:34.794 --> 01:34:37.504
BENNETT: But I'm forgetting
that the dead know everything.

01:34:37.756 --> 01:34:42.760
You should be fighting back the tears,
not eyeing up the talent.

01:34:44.387 --> 01:34:45.580
Well, it's a thought.

01:34:45.680 --> 01:34:46.957
She's dead now.

01:34:47.057 --> 01:34:48.500
I can do what I want with her.

01:34:48.600 --> 01:34:51.435
MISS SHEPHERD: Yes, you can.
I'm dead. Feel free!

01:34:52.020 --> 01:34:53.270
Oh. Hello.

01:34:53.688 --> 01:34:57.399
There are two of you now.
Is that because you're in two minds?

01:34:57.525 --> 01:34:58.525
- Yes.
- No.

01:34:58.777 --> 01:35:00.486
Where are you going, Miss Shepherd?

01:35:01.279 --> 01:35:05.850
I was wondering, would either of you object
if the van became a place of pilgrimage?

01:35:05.950 --> 01:35:08.520
- No.
- I'm getting rid of the van. The van is going.

01:35:08.620 --> 01:35:12.440
Healing could take place, and any proceeds
could go towards the nuns.

01:35:12.540 --> 01:35:14.359
The nuns?
What did the nuns ever do for you?

01:35:14.459 --> 01:35:17.195
Well, not much,
but when the donations start rolling in

01:35:17.295 --> 01:35:19.948
they'll realise
what a catch I would have been.

01:35:20.048 --> 01:35:22.633
It was the same with Saint Bernadette.

01:35:22.801 --> 01:35:26.095
They didn't realise with her
until it was too late.

01:35:27.555 --> 01:35:28.707
MISS SHEPHERD: This way.

01:35:28.807 --> 01:35:30.641
- There's someone I want you to meet.
- (SIGHS)

01:35:31.976 --> 01:35:33.962
That's something you could do.

01:35:34.062 --> 01:35:39.149
This thing you're trying to write,
well, you could pump it up a bit.

01:35:39.567 --> 01:35:41.761
If it were on the lines of
The Song of Bernadette,

01:35:41.861 --> 01:35:43.821
it would make you a packet.

01:35:44.114 --> 01:35:47.241
I mean, why? Why did you just let me die?

01:35:47.826 --> 01:35:50.244
I'd like to go up into heaven.

01:35:50.662 --> 01:35:53.288
An ascension, possibly.

01:35:53.665 --> 01:35:55.499
A transfiguration.

01:35:55.708 --> 01:35:57.235
That's not really my kind of thing.

01:35:57.335 --> 01:35:58.877
Oh. There you are.

01:35:59.796 --> 01:36:01.489
This is my new friend.

01:36:01.589 --> 01:36:02.907
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:36:03.007 --> 01:36:05.410
It's the young man
who crashed into the van.

01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:06.552
Hi.

01:36:06.678 --> 01:36:08.512
I thought it was me that killed him.

01:36:08.763 --> 01:36:10.915
Turns out it was his own fault.

01:36:11.015 --> 01:36:14.935
So, one way and another,
we've got heaps to talk about.

01:36:15.728 --> 01:36:17.020
Goodbye.

01:36:18.106 --> 01:36:19.299
MISS SHEPHERD: Mr Bennett?

01:36:19.399 --> 01:36:20.691
Yes.

01:36:20.984 --> 01:36:23.970
I came into your drive for three months...

01:36:24.070 --> 01:36:25.096
(CHUCKLES)

01:36:25.196 --> 01:36:28.991
And I stayed for 15 years!

01:36:29.242 --> 01:36:32.202
- Mr Bennett?
- BOTH: Yes?

01:36:32.370 --> 01:36:35.038
- Do you know what that is?
- BOTH: No.

01:36:35.707 --> 01:36:38.292
It's the last laugh.

01:36:38.751 --> 01:36:40.794
(LAUGHING)

01:36:45.133 --> 01:36:48.051
Well, she wanted an ascension.

01:36:50.221 --> 01:36:52.222
Let's answer her prayers.

01:36:54.350 --> 01:36:57.519
Stand by, Miss Mary Teresa Shepherd,

01:36:58.188 --> 01:37:00.647
late of 23 Gloucester Crescent.

01:37:03.902 --> 01:37:05.277
Up you go.

01:37:20.335 --> 01:37:23.587
BENNETT: Starting out as someone
incidental to my life,

01:37:24.422 --> 01:37:30.260
she remained on the edge of it so long,
she became not incidental to it at all.

01:37:30.929 --> 01:37:34.707
As homebound sons and daughters
looking after their parents

01:37:34.807 --> 01:37:39.311
think of it as just marking time
before their lives start,

01:37:39.938 --> 01:37:45.275
so, like them, I learned there is
no such thing as marking time

01:37:46.277 --> 01:37:48.487
and that time marks you.

01:37:49.614 --> 01:37:53.768
In accommodating her
and accommodating to her,

01:37:53.868 --> 01:37:57.204
I find 20 years of my life has gone.

01:38:00.291 --> 01:38:03.945
This broken-down old woman, her delusions,

01:38:04.045 --> 01:38:09.132
and the slow abridgement of her life,
with all its vehicular permutations,

01:38:10.051 --> 01:38:12.970
these have been given to me to record

01:38:13.137 --> 01:38:17.516
as others record journeys
across Afghanistan or Patagonia

01:38:18.893 --> 01:38:21.270
or the thighs of a dozen women.

01:38:21.896 --> 01:38:24.481
You wanted me to make things happen.

01:38:25.316 --> 01:38:29.653
And I never have much,
but it doesn't matter.

01:38:30.989 --> 01:38:33.490
Because what I've learnt,

01:38:33.992 --> 01:38:39.037
and maybe she taught me, is that
you don't put yourself into what you write.

01:38:40.123 --> 01:38:41.790
You find yourself there.

01:38:42.166 --> 01:38:43.902
I never wanted to write about her.

01:38:44.002 --> 01:38:47.129
If there'd been a bit more in your life,
I wouldn't have had to.

01:38:48.673 --> 01:38:50.340
Maybe I will now.

01:38:51.342 --> 01:38:52.467
What?

01:38:53.678 --> 01:38:55.762
Have a bit more in my life.

01:38:56.014 --> 01:38:57.957
I might even start living.

01:38:58.057 --> 01:38:59.391
Good day?

01:38:59.601 --> 01:39:01.143
(SIGHS) Not bad. You?

01:39:02.020 --> 01:39:03.395
Oh. These came.

01:39:05.523 --> 01:39:06.857
PARTNER: Hmm. Very good.

01:39:07.400 --> 01:39:09.443
- Coming down?
- All right.

01:39:10.570 --> 01:39:12.738
That's the end of the story.

01:39:13.364 --> 01:39:15.225
It might make a play.

01:39:15.325 --> 01:39:16.867
What do you think?

01:39:17.702 --> 01:39:20.954
Now I'm here, I think you should
stop talking to yourself.

01:39:36.929 --> 01:39:37.971
Hi.

01:39:38.556 --> 01:39:39.890
Hi, Alan.

01:39:40.642 --> 01:39:43.727
FILM DIRECTOR: Okay, nice and quiet,
please. Here we go. And let's turn over.

01:39:45.355 --> 01:39:47.064
- B.
- WOMAN: Mark it.

01:39:47.398 --> 01:39:48.732
MAN: Okay, take 14.

01:39:51.235 --> 01:39:52.861
FILM DIRECTOR: And, action!

01:39:53.946 --> 01:39:57.517
Gloucester Crescent
has had many notable residents,

01:39:57.617 --> 01:40:02.480
but none odder or more remarkable
than Miss Mary Shepherd,

01:40:02.580 --> 01:40:06.249
to whom we dedicate
this blue plaque today.

01:40:11.214 --> 01:40:13.256
