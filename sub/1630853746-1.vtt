17:24.844 --> 17:26.212
it was gonna be
the both of you,

17:26.279 --> 17:29.248
I could tell that you both are
really close to family,

17:29.315 --> 17:31.117
which is very, very
important to me as well.

I promise to do right by you

- Jordan, Rachel.

18:18.397 --> 18:20.132
- So when I found out there
would be two Bachelorettes,

18:20.199 --> 18:21.367
I got a little nervous.

18:21.434 --> 18:22.501
I wasn't quite sure
how I was gonna speak

18:22.568 --> 18:24.737
to two beautiful women
at the same time.

18:24.804 --> 18:26.238
So I brought these.

18:26.305 --> 18:28.441
- Okay.
- Oh.

18:28.507 --> 18:29.942
- Uh-oh. Okay.

18:30.009 --> 18:31.944
- I know family is a big part
of your life.

18:32.011 --> 18:33.713
And I only live
about an hour from you.

18:33.779 --> 18:36.349
So if we end up together
in the end of this,

18:36.415 --> 18:38.017
maybe you won't have
to move too far.

18:38.084 --> 18:40.720
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

18:40.786 --> 18:41.887
- Gabby, it's your turn.
- Oh, are you done?

18:41.954 --> 18:43.422
I didn't hear a thing.

18:43.489 --> 18:46.525

you're an excellent nurse.

18:50.563 --> 18:52.365
I've broken plenty of bones,

18:52.431 --> 18:54.834
so I spent my fair share of
time in the hospital as well.

18:54.900 --> 18:56.902
So maybe you're my all-star
nurse that I've never had.

18:56.969 --> 18:59.038
- [laughs]
Yeah.

feel special individually.

absolutely wonderful women.

19:17.690 --> 19:20.559

on this journey.

a little bit.

I'm here to meet
my Bachelorette.

19:52.758 --> 19:54.360

is interesting,

19:54.427 --> 19:56.162
but I think just making sure
they have their own

19:56.228 --> 19:57.897
individualized experience
is important.

It's all about
that first impression.

20:06.439 --> 20:08.507

- Hello, hello.

30:45.577 --> 30:47.546
Whoa.
[horse snorts]

30:47.612 --> 30:50.649
I know this looks like a cover
to a romantic novel,

30:50.716 --> 30:53.452
but I'm only here
for a happy ending.

30:53.518 --> 30:54.486
[horse whinnies]

30:54.553 --> 30:55.954
- Um...
- We're here for that.

30:56.021 --> 30:57.789
- Yeah.
[laughter]

30:57.856 --> 30:59.291
- All right, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

30:59.358 --> 31:00.625
- At least he's fit.

31:00.692 --> 31:02.194
I like the hair.

31:02.260 --> 31:03.462
He gonna get chilly.

31:03.528 --> 31:04.730
- Nice to meet you.

31:04.796 --> 31:06.064
- Hi.
[laughter]

31:06.131 --> 31:07.332
- I'm a little bit, uh...

31:07.399 --> 31:08.734
- Oiled up?
- Oiled up!

31:08.800 --> 31:09.901
- You know what, I could--

31:09.968 --> 31:11.103
I could use some...
- Yeah.

31:11.169 --> 31:13.071
Wipe some on!
- Yeah!

31:13.138 --> 31:14.773
I could use some of that.

31:14.840 --> 31:16.608
I'm kind of dry these days.

31:16.675 --> 31:18.110
- Me too.
- [laughing] Yeah.

31:18.176 --> 31:19.478
- So my name's Jacob,

31:19.544 --> 31:20.746
and I'll see you guys inside.

31:20.812 --> 31:22.280
- We'll see you inside.
- Sounds good.

31:22.347 --> 31:23.882
- Nice to meet you.
- Thanks, Jacob.

31:23.949 --> 31:25.484
Are you gonna take
your horse with you?

31:25.550 --> 31:27.586
- Uh, Blanco?
Come with?

31:27.652 --> 31:29.287
No? All right.
- Blanco, quick, quick!

31:29.354 --> 31:30.655
- I'll see you next time, okay?

31:30.722 --> 31:33.125
- He doesn't follow commands
very well.

31:33.191 --> 31:35.394
[laughter]
[horse snorts]

31:35.460 --> 31:36.928
[contestants clamoring]
- Oh, [bleep].

31:36.995 --> 31:38.063
- Yeah.

31:38.130 --> 31:39.564
[with Australian accent]
Ah, down under!

31:39.631 --> 31:41.833
- Oh, my God.
- I didn't choose this life.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.402
This life chose me.

31:43.468 --> 31:45.070
- Ah.

31:45.137 --> 31:48.006
<i>- Wow, this dude rides in</i>
<i>on a horse.</i>

31:48.073 --> 31:50.976
He looks like
he came out of, like,

31:51.042 --> 31:52.511
some romance novel.

31:52.577 --> 31:53.879
- We don't need no more men.

31:53.945 --> 31:56.848
I think there's a lot
of masculinity inside.

31:56.915 --> 31:58.950
- [laughs]
<i>- I mean, where does it end?</i>

31:59.050 --> 32:00.152
There's so many of us.

32:00.218 --> 32:02.287
- Seriously,
you both are stunning.

32:02.354 --> 32:03.655
Absolutely beautiful,
and I can't wait

32:03.722 --> 32:04.956
to get to know you guys inside.

32:05.023 --> 32:06.658
- We can't wait either.
- So yeah. Absolutely.

32:06.725 --> 32:08.860
<i>- Right when I think</i>
<i>we're wrapping up,</i>

32:08.927 --> 32:09.961
more roll in.

32:10.028 --> 32:11.363
- You familiar
with this material?

32:11.430 --> 32:12.798
It's husband material.

32:12.864 --> 32:14.232
- Oh!
- Oh!

32:14.299 --> 32:15.967
- How many more people
you guys think are coming?

32:16.001 --> 32:17.169
- It's the unknown.

32:18.737 --> 32:20.639
- Twins!
- Hello.

32:20.705 --> 32:21.907
- Hello.
- Amazing.

32:21.973 --> 32:23.842
- This is perfect.
- Hello. How are you guys?

32:23.909 --> 32:25.076
- Hello.
- I'm seeing double.

32:25.143 --> 32:26.978
- How are you?
- Twins?

32:27.045 --> 32:28.113
No!

32:28.180 --> 32:29.781
- All right, y'all--hey.

32:29.848 --> 32:31.783
- So I'm wondering
when it's gonna stop

32:31.850 --> 32:33.351
and when they're gonna,
you know,

32:33.418 --> 32:35.220
cut us off here.

32:35.287 --> 32:36.755
- Oh.
- Oh. Oh.

32:36.822 --> 32:38.056
Mic drop?

32:38.123 --> 32:39.324
- Yeah.
- Okay.

32:39.391 --> 32:40.959
- That's right, I did that.
- To the floor?

32:41.026 --> 32:42.194
[laughs]

32:42.260 --> 32:45.297
- It's gonna be a long night.

32:45.363 --> 32:48.033
- So I know that
a long night in heels...

32:48.099 --> 32:49.334
- Oh, thank you.
- Can be...

32:49.401 --> 32:50.969
- This might be the best
introduction we've seen.

32:51.036 --> 32:52.370
- Yeah, of course.
- A front-row seat.

32:52.437 --> 32:53.705
- Yeah, I have a mother
and a sister,

32:53.772 --> 32:55.807
so I know
how long nights can be.

32:55.874 --> 32:56.975
both: Thank you.
- Yeah.

32:57.042 --> 32:58.643
I'll see you both inside.
- Oh!

32:58.710 --> 32:59.644
Can we keep these chairs?
- Yeah.

32:59.711 --> 33:01.379
[laughter]
- That was it?

33:01.446 --> 33:02.614
- That's it.

33:02.681 --> 33:03.849
I just wanted
to give you guys a breather

33:03.915 --> 33:05.116
from being on your feet.
- Oh, that's so nice!

33:05.183 --> 33:06.718
- Oh, thank you.
We appreciate it.

33:06.785 --> 33:08.887
- We'll be taking these chairs
with us everywhere.

33:08.954 --> 33:10.288
[laughter]
Bye, Spencer.

33:10.355 --> 33:12.390
- See you guys.
- See you soon.

33:12.457 --> 33:13.825
- I liked him.
- What a gentleman.

33:13.892 --> 33:15.260
- He's my type.

33:15.327 --> 33:18.129
- Oh, he's cute.
- [laughing] Yeah.

33:18.196 --> 33:19.731
<i>I think Spencer is really cute</i>

33:19.798 --> 33:21.366
<i>and he has great style.</i>

33:21.433 --> 33:22.701
- Cute, cute, cute.

33:22.767 --> 33:23.735
Good...
- I know.

33:23.802 --> 33:25.203
- Good limo.
- Yeah.

33:25.270 --> 33:26.771
<i>I hope Rachel's not into him</i>

33:26.838 --> 33:29.374
<i>because I want</i>
<i>to get to know him.</i>

33:29.441 --> 33:30.809
<i>But, you know,</i>
<i>there's so many men,</i>

33:30.876 --> 33:33.144
<i>there's two of us,</i>
<i>and it's clear that</i>

33:33.211 --> 33:35.747
we're going to be attracted
to the same guys.

33:35.814 --> 33:37.182
- I honestly feel like
the luckiest guy

33:37.249 --> 33:38.783
in the world right now,
standing in front of you two.

33:38.850 --> 33:41.653
And I can confidently say two
is definitely better than one.

33:41.720 --> 33:44.222
- [laughs] Yeah.
- Of course.

33:44.289 --> 33:46.558
<i>- I mean, it's gonna get</i>
<i>pretty tricky,</i>

33:46.625 --> 33:49.060
and I think
there's going to be hardship

33:49.127 --> 33:51.062
with dating
the same pool of men.

33:51.129 --> 33:53.298
- You know, this is history in
the making, two Bachelorettes.

33:53.365 --> 33:55.800
Like, how is this gonna work?
You know what I'm saying?

33:55.867 --> 33:59.104
- If two of them ultimately
end up being into, like, one,

33:59.170 --> 34:01.306
that's gonna be, like,
a real interesting scenario.

34:01.373 --> 34:03.975
- This morning, I woke up,

34:04.042 --> 34:06.678
I opened my eyes, and...

34:06.745 --> 34:08.580
both: Oh!

34:08.647 --> 34:10.048
- I see you, Rachel,

34:10.115 --> 34:12.884
and you, Gabby.

34:12.951 --> 34:14.786
- Nice!
- Yeah, it's pretty good.

34:14.853 --> 34:17.289
But now that I have met
you guys,

34:17.355 --> 34:19.524
I will say the real thing
is much better.

34:19.591 --> 34:20.892
<i>- This is crazy.</i>

34:20.959 --> 34:23.328
<i>I have no idea</i>
<i>how this is gonna work.</i>

34:23.395 --> 34:24.930
<i>It worries me a little bit</i>

34:24.996 --> 34:27.599
because I definitely feel like
Gabby and I

34:27.666 --> 34:29.000
could fall for the same guys.

34:29.067 --> 34:30.869
- I am a professional
race car driver.

34:30.936 --> 34:32.070
- Oh, wow.

34:32.137 --> 34:33.471
- So you could say
that I'm used to

34:33.538 --> 34:35.206
some wild and crazy rides.

34:35.273 --> 34:37.475
<i>- I mean, we only have so many</i>
<i>guys here we can date.</i>

34:37.542 --> 34:40.011
We're gonna, obviously,
both like a couple of them.

34:40.078 --> 34:41.880
- Do either of you guys know
how to tie a tie?

34:41.947 --> 34:43.548
Please help me.
- Oh, I can maybe--

34:43.615 --> 34:45.083
- Give it your best shot.
- Should I try?

34:45.150 --> 34:47.118
<i>- I really hope</i>
<i>that doesn't happen,</i>

34:47.185 --> 34:49.287
but of course
I want to remain open.

34:49.354 --> 34:50.822
- Oh, perfect.
- Yeah.

34:50.889 --> 34:52.991
- Just fold it down,
fold it back up.

34:53.058 --> 34:54.993
Rachel, please help.
- [laughs]

34:55.060 --> 34:57.462
- Well, I look pretty good.

34:57.529 --> 34:59.931
<i>- At the end of the day,</i>
<i>it is an individual journey.</i>

34:59.998 --> 35:03.868
We both are here to find
our own individual husbands,

35:03.935 --> 35:05.203
hopefully.

35:05.971 --> 35:07.639
- All right.
Rachel, Gabby.

35:07.706 --> 35:09.741
You've now met all 32 men.

35:09.808 --> 35:12.143
I mean, that's a lot of guys
to meet in one night.

35:12.210 --> 35:14.112
- It's a lot,
but we have each other.

35:14.179 --> 35:15.614
- Right, we're willing

35:15.680 --> 35:17.315
to take on the challenge!
- Divide and conquer!

35:17.382 --> 35:18.717
- Yeah.

35:18.783 --> 35:19.918
- It is a lot of guys, though.

35:19.985 --> 35:21.419
For real, a lot of people here.

35:21.486 --> 35:23.521
- The more competition,
the better, right?

35:23.588 --> 35:25.757
<i>- The guys are all here</i>
<i>and it is crowded</i>

35:25.824 --> 35:27.892
and hot in here,
that's for sure.

35:27.959 --> 35:29.060
- You guys have a strategy

35:29.127 --> 35:30.362
how you're gonna divide
and conquer?

35:30.428 --> 35:31.429
- Yeah.
- Hopefully we can just

35:31.496 --> 35:32.697
figure it out on the way.

35:32.764 --> 35:34.032
See where the night takes us.

35:34.099 --> 35:35.900
<i>- This is going to be wild.</i>

35:35.967 --> 35:37.235
<i>There's two girls.</i>

35:37.302 --> 35:38.637
<i>There's two.</i>

35:38.703 --> 35:41.039
I can't even anticipate
what's gonna happen.

35:41.106 --> 35:42.540
- I don't know
how these two Bachelorettes--

35:42.607 --> 35:43.842
how this is gonna go.

35:43.908 --> 35:45.510
There's a lot of questions
that's gonna happen

35:45.577 --> 35:47.145
down the line for all of us.
- Yeah.

35:47.212 --> 35:48.647
<i>- There's no precedent</i>
<i>for this.</i>

35:48.713 --> 35:50.882
There's no basis for this
at all.

35:50.949 --> 35:53.318
- Having the two Bachelorettes
is legendary.

35:53.385 --> 35:55.787
It's also gonna create
some drama, for sure.

35:55.854 --> 35:57.856
<i>- Naturally, as men,</i>
<i>we're territorial,</i>

35:57.922 --> 35:59.624
but we got two Bachelorettes.

35:59.691 --> 36:01.226
It's a different ball game.

36:01.292 --> 36:02.961
- It's definitely gonna be
double the fun,

36:03.028 --> 36:04.229
you know, double the action,

36:04.295 --> 36:06.998
double the chances
to find love, I feel like.

36:07.065 --> 36:09.567
<i>- So you gotta make it known</i>
<i>that you're a contender.</i>

36:09.634 --> 36:11.603
And guess what?
You're talking to Mario.

36:11.670 --> 36:14.272
Hey, we ready for whatever.

36:14.339 --> 36:16.041
We ready for whatever.

36:16.107 --> 36:17.642
- To history
in the making here.

36:17.709 --> 36:19.644
We got Gabby and Rachel.

36:19.711 --> 36:21.980
"Bachelorette" season 19.
Let's do it, gentlemen.

36:22.047 --> 36:23.381
- Whoo!

36:23.448 --> 36:25.784
all: Cheers.
- Let's go!

36:28.820 --> 36:30.922
- My heart has been
pounding nonstop

36:30.989 --> 36:32.357
ever since I've seen them both.

36:32.424 --> 36:33.758
And...
- Same.

36:33.825 --> 36:36.494
I'm just excited to talk,
get some words out there.

36:36.561 --> 36:38.129
- Like, rolling up
in that limo,

36:38.196 --> 36:39.798
and there's two out there,
it's like...

36:39.864 --> 36:40.865
- Both beautiful.
- Both gorgeous.

36:40.932 --> 36:42.100
- I didn't even know
what to do.

36:42.167 --> 36:43.968
- They're gonna marry
one of us, you know,

36:44.035 --> 36:46.071
whether it's, you know,
it's out here--

36:46.137 --> 36:47.972
obviously me--or in there.

36:48.039 --> 36:50.008
[laughter]

36:50.075 --> 36:51.309
- We're excited.
- Yeah.

36:51.376 --> 36:53.645
- Well, I know all these men
are so anxious

36:53.712 --> 36:55.447
to meet you all and get
a chance to sit down with you

36:55.513 --> 36:56.581
and get to know you better.

36:56.648 --> 36:58.083
I know you're also
very excited too.

36:58.149 --> 36:59.751
But before we get to that,

36:59.818 --> 37:02.020
I do want to talk you through
what's gonna happen tonight.

37:02.087 --> 37:04.022
So obviously, you're both gonna
go into the party.

37:04.089 --> 37:05.824
You're gonna have a chance,
both of you,

37:05.890 --> 37:07.592
to speak to every single one
of the guys,

37:07.659 --> 37:09.327
just like any other
Bachelorette would do.

37:09.394 --> 37:10.695
Now, later in the night,
obviously,

37:10.762 --> 37:12.263
there'll be
a First Impression Rose.

37:12.330 --> 37:13.698
- That's awesome.
- And you're gonna

37:13.765 --> 37:15.734
hand that out
to that special someone

37:15.800 --> 37:17.302
that you feel a really strong
connection with.

37:17.368 --> 37:18.403
- Oh, my goodness.

37:18.470 --> 37:20.238
This is crazy.
- Yeah, I know.

37:20.305 --> 37:22.774
- Get ready for the night
of your lives.

37:22.841 --> 37:23.942
Head on in.

37:24.008 --> 37:25.276
Gabby, Rachel, good luck.
- Let's do it!

37:25.343 --> 37:26.644
- Bye, Jesse!

37:27.812 --> 37:29.180
[laughing]
- Oh, my God.

37:29.247 --> 37:32.250
<i>- Having two Bachelorettes</i>
<i>is crazy.</i>

37:32.317 --> 37:36.621
<i>I have absolutely no idea</i>
<i>how this is gonna work.</i>

37:36.688 --> 37:38.223
How does the First Impression
Rose work?

37:38.289 --> 37:39.858
What if we want to give it
to the same person?

37:39.924 --> 37:42.127
<i>There's so many questions</i>
<i>moving forward.</i>

37:42.193 --> 37:44.362
- Who are you guys gonna talk
to first, Gabby or Rachel?

37:44.429 --> 37:46.698
- I just want a chance
to showcase who I am

37:46.765 --> 37:49.067
to one or both of them,
honestly, on the first night.

37:49.134 --> 37:50.769
- You can't go wrong
with either one of them.

37:50.835 --> 37:53.304
[indistinct chatter]

37:53.371 --> 37:56.207
[all cheering]

37:58.276 --> 38:00.411
- Finally!
- Whoo!

38:00.478 --> 38:02.213
- Wow, you guys look
incredible.

38:02.280 --> 38:03.748
Thank you so much.
- Of course.

38:03.815 --> 38:05.483
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

38:05.550 --> 38:07.418
- That's that
Southern hospitality there.

38:07.485 --> 38:09.053
- All right.
- Oh, my gosh, well,

38:09.120 --> 38:12.457
we are both
so excited to be here.

38:12.524 --> 38:14.993
- Yeah, we know what it's like
being in your guys' shoes.

38:15.059 --> 38:16.861
We were just there
not that long ago.

38:16.928 --> 38:18.329
- I think I was standing
right back there.

38:18.396 --> 38:19.898
[laughter]

38:19.964 --> 38:22.066
- And we just want to say
thank you so much.

38:22.133 --> 38:24.169
We know, like, how much
of a sacrifice

38:24.235 --> 38:25.670
it is to be here.

38:25.737 --> 38:27.539
There's so much unknown,

38:27.605 --> 38:29.674
but the more you lean in,
truly,

38:29.741 --> 38:31.276
the more you do get out.

38:31.342 --> 38:34.145
So I hope you guys can
trust us along the way.

38:34.212 --> 38:36.581
- Gabby and I,
we're both really confident

38:36.648 --> 38:40.051
that if you guys are open
and vulnerable

38:40.118 --> 38:43.021
and give us all
good communication,

38:43.087 --> 38:45.523
that love is here.

38:45.590 --> 38:47.559
- Yeah, as--I don't know
if you guys know,

38:47.625 --> 38:50.195
but this is the most men
we've ever had here.

38:50.261 --> 38:51.429
- We noticed.

38:51.496 --> 38:52.831
[laughter]
We noticed for sure.

38:52.897 --> 38:55.099
- The testosterone is flowing.

38:55.166 --> 38:56.401
- It feels good.

38:56.467 --> 38:58.203
- Yeah!
[laughter]

38:58.269 --> 38:59.838
- But we are breaking
new ground

38:59.904 --> 39:02.740
with two Bachelorettes
and with all of you guys,

39:02.807 --> 39:04.876
so I hope we're patient
with each other.

39:04.943 --> 39:07.145
- Yeah, we just look forward
to this journey.

39:07.212 --> 39:09.814
It's gonna be a wild ride.

39:09.881 --> 39:11.783
I'm ready.
- Let's do it!

39:11.850 --> 39:14.152
[all cheering]
- Should we cheers? Yes!

39:14.219 --> 39:16.154
Cheers!
- Cheers!

39:16.221 --> 39:17.422
- Cheers.

39:17.488 --> 39:18.590
- We'll get better at that.

39:18.656 --> 39:19.757
We'll get better at the cheers.

39:19.824 --> 39:22.193
[laughter]
- Yeah, it's a lot at once.

39:23.494 --> 39:25.196
I honestly have no clue

39:25.263 --> 39:27.232
how the night's gonna work
having two of us.

39:27.298 --> 39:29.601
<i>I kind of just have</i>
<i>no expectations right now.</i>

39:29.667 --> 39:30.835
<i>I just want to have</i>
<i>a good time,</i>

39:30.902 --> 39:32.303
<i>almost, like, get my feet wet</i>

39:32.370 --> 39:35.974
in the sense that I'm dating,
like, multiple guys.

39:36.040 --> 39:37.842
- Do y'all want to see
a couple of magic tricks?

39:37.909 --> 39:40.044
- Would love.
- All right.

39:40.111 --> 39:41.446
Do you guys remember my name?

39:41.512 --> 39:42.480
- Roby.

39:42.547 --> 39:43.514
- How do you remember it?

39:43.581 --> 39:44.515
- 'Cause--
- Magic.

39:44.582 --> 39:45.583
[laughter]

39:45.650 --> 39:47.318
- Here. Grab one.
- Oh, do it. Okay.

39:47.385 --> 39:48.486
- I'll keep going.
- Got it.

39:48.553 --> 39:49.854
- Look at it, both of you.

39:49.921 --> 39:51.122
- Ooh.

39:51.189 --> 39:53.491
- Good, good, good.
Say "stop" at any moment.

39:53.558 --> 39:54.559
- Stop.

39:54.626 --> 39:55.994
- Put your card down
right over here.

39:56.060 --> 39:57.495
<i>[whimsical music]</i>

39:57.562 --> 40:00.465
So I just rub down the pants,
and I get a bit of color

40:00.531 --> 40:02.734
from the pants...

40:02.800 --> 40:04.435
into the pack, like so.

40:04.502 --> 40:05.970
- Oh, God.
- Oh, yes.

40:06.037 --> 40:07.305
Now, that color could
have gone anywhere.

40:07.372 --> 40:08.806
It went to that seven
of hearts, yes?

40:08.873 --> 40:10.942
both: Oh!

40:11.009 --> 40:12.977
- The magician.
He pulled a Houdini.

40:13.044 --> 40:14.479
- I feel like, honestly, like,

40:14.545 --> 40:16.481
yeah, you can give them, like,
tricks and stuff like that,

40:16.547 --> 40:18.683
but at the end of the day,
how long is that gonna work?

40:18.750 --> 40:20.018
- I don't want it to be
the Roby Show.

40:20.084 --> 40:21.753
I want it to be the Rachel--

40:21.819 --> 40:22.887
this is the Rachel
and Gabby Show.

40:22.954 --> 40:24.355
[laughter]

40:24.422 --> 40:25.757
How is it like being
on the other side

40:25.823 --> 40:27.292
of the table right now?

40:27.358 --> 40:28.760
- It's refreshing.
- Yeah?

40:28.826 --> 40:30.061
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it's crazy.

40:30.128 --> 40:31.829
- It's like you're in
the position of power.

40:31.896 --> 40:33.531
You have the authority.
You have the control.

40:33.598 --> 40:35.600
You know, you can say
that "no."

40:35.667 --> 40:36.968
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah, absolutely.

40:37.035 --> 40:38.336
How are you feeling?

40:38.403 --> 40:39.904
- I'm so nervous.
It's frenetic.

40:39.971 --> 40:41.105
- That's normal.
- Yeah.

40:41.172 --> 40:42.173
- We've been there.
- Yeah?

40:42.240 --> 40:43.608
- Yeah.
- Definitely normal.

40:43.675 --> 40:45.743
- What was the scariest
moment for you?

40:45.810 --> 40:47.612
- Um, all of it.

40:47.679 --> 40:49.714
- All of it?
- [laughs] I mean...

40:49.781 --> 40:51.249
- Where are they?
I want to find them.

40:51.316 --> 40:53.217
That's what I'm saying.
- Yeah, we have to.

40:53.284 --> 40:55.186
- She's still over there?
- No.

40:55.253 --> 40:56.587
- Are you gonna sneak in there
and steal some time?

40:56.654 --> 40:57.789
- You've got to be sneaky.

40:57.855 --> 40:59.257
Just a little bit.
- But do you want to step

40:59.324 --> 41:01.426
on people's toes?
I don't know, 'cause...

41:01.492 --> 41:02.694
- Not on your toes, for sure.

41:02.760 --> 41:05.196
You're at the most--
you're most vulnerable!

41:05.263 --> 41:07.598
- Might have to be aggressive
to really get that time

41:07.665 --> 41:11.869
and actually make a--
I guess, like, an impression.

41:11.936 --> 41:13.671
- Double the trouble.

41:13.738 --> 41:15.173
- [laughing]
We love it.

41:15.239 --> 41:16.607
- We wanted to meet
you guys together

41:16.674 --> 41:17.976
'cause, obviously, we're twins,

41:18.042 --> 41:19.978
but we want you to see
the differences between us,

41:20.044 --> 41:21.412
'cause our personalities,
I feel like,

41:21.479 --> 41:22.880
we're very different.

41:22.947 --> 41:24.048
For me, for instance,
I feel like

41:24.115 --> 41:25.383
I'm a little bit more
of a laid-back,

41:25.450 --> 41:27.285
reserved kind of person,
a little bit outgoing.

41:27.352 --> 41:28.786
He's more of a bold,

41:28.853 --> 41:30.355
out-there type person.
- Bold...

41:30.421 --> 41:31.489
Okay.
- Yeah.

41:31.556 --> 41:33.157
- So that's how we kind
of differentiate

41:33.224 --> 41:34.726
between each other
and who we attract,

41:34.792 --> 41:36.494
who we don't attract, like,
so that's how we...

41:36.561 --> 41:37.729
yeah.
- Okay.

41:37.795 --> 41:38.930
- Yeah, so, definitely.

41:38.997 --> 41:41.165
- How does it feel
coming in together?

41:41.232 --> 41:43.134
- You guys definitely
make us feel calm, though.

41:43.201 --> 41:45.069
I could tell that energy,
that--yeah, exactly.

41:45.136 --> 41:47.405
- You bring
such positive energy.

41:47.472 --> 41:48.706
- So you guys--
- That's so nice.

41:48.773 --> 41:51.542
- Yeah, yeah.
You're--so, okay.

41:51.609 --> 41:53.344
You guys said you have
your differences.

41:53.411 --> 41:54.812
- Yes.
- So what is

41:54.879 --> 41:56.614
the differences
besides personality-wise?

41:56.681 --> 41:58.049
Hobbies?

41:58.116 --> 41:59.917
- No--honestly, not a lot.
- Or same hobbies?

42:00.018 --> 42:01.519
- Everything.
- So we're all the same?

42:01.586 --> 42:03.688
- Yeah.
- Went to the same school.

42:03.755 --> 42:05.823
- Oh, so you guys
never separate?

42:05.890 --> 42:08.326
- Well, we didn't live together
all throughout school.

42:08.393 --> 42:09.727
We did, like, a couple
of years and then we, like,

42:09.794 --> 42:10.795
separated
'cause we wanted to do

42:10.862 --> 42:11.929
our own thing
and be individual.

42:11.996 --> 42:13.898
- Absolutely.
- We had to, you know.

42:13.965 --> 42:15.266
- Yeah. Kind of--
- Like job-wise,

42:15.333 --> 42:16.567
we do the same job.
- Yeah, what's job?

42:16.634 --> 42:18.870
So we're--medical
advertising's what we do,

42:18.936 --> 42:20.972
but both
separate companies, though.

42:21.039 --> 42:23.107
So, like,
that's the only difference.

42:23.174 --> 42:24.675
<i>- The conversations</i>
<i>with the twins</i>

42:24.742 --> 42:25.977
and Rachel and I

42:26.044 --> 42:27.578
is--just ain't working for me,

42:27.645 --> 42:29.547
kind of, romantically.

42:29.614 --> 42:32.850
I feel like I can't,
like, build a very strong bond

42:32.917 --> 42:34.685
<i>with either of the twins.</i>

42:36.387 --> 42:38.523
Yeah, it's just, like...

42:38.589 --> 42:40.391
I don't know.

42:40.458 --> 42:42.927
It ain't doing it for me.
[laughs]

42:42.994 --> 42:45.229
Do you feel like you guys
can read each other's minds?

42:45.296 --> 42:46.731
- Like, across campus
in college,

42:46.798 --> 42:48.499
I could spot him
from miles away.

42:48.566 --> 42:50.334
- Oh, wow.
- Stuff like that.

42:50.401 --> 42:51.369
Do you guys experience
any of that,

42:51.436 --> 42:52.603
you know, being together?

42:52.670 --> 42:54.205
- We weren't
in the womb together, so--

42:54.272 --> 42:56.607
[laughter]
I think it's much different.

42:56.674 --> 42:57.708
- We can read
each other's minds.

42:57.775 --> 42:59.277
- Yeah.
- Never know.

42:59.343 --> 43:02.013
- There's me, there's Gabby,
there's both the twins.

43:02.080 --> 43:03.748
<i>I don't know if they're</i>
<i>trying to get us to go</i>

43:03.815 --> 43:05.917
<i>on double dates,</i>
<i>planning for the future,</i>

43:06.017 --> 43:08.553
<i>but definitely hard</i>
<i>to form a connection</i>

43:08.619 --> 43:10.755
<i>when there's multiple people</i>
<i>sitting here.</i>

43:10.822 --> 43:12.523
I'm not into it.

43:12.590 --> 43:13.991
- The one thing I want
to get across is,

43:14.058 --> 43:15.126
I'm here for something real.

43:15.193 --> 43:16.327
- Okay, me too. Awesome.

43:16.394 --> 43:18.563
- And I want to be here.
I want to be super open.

43:18.629 --> 43:21.499
And whenever I found out both
of you were the Bachelorettes--

43:21.566 --> 43:22.600
- Yeah, what were
your thoughts on that?

43:22.667 --> 43:23.601
Were you nervous?
- It was a little scary.

43:23.668 --> 43:24.602
Exactly.
I was a little nervous.

43:24.669 --> 43:25.803
Like, I came into this,

43:25.870 --> 43:27.271
I kind of showed you guys...

43:27.338 --> 43:28.439
I wanted to, like,
separate you two.

43:28.506 --> 43:30.808
That's how I did
the earphone thing.

43:30.875 --> 43:32.844
- And we definitely
noticed that as well.

43:32.910 --> 43:34.078
- So I wanted to,
like, show you that,

43:34.145 --> 43:35.780
like, I had
the Florida vibe with you.

43:35.847 --> 43:37.682
And then I didn't want you
to hear what I said to her.

43:37.748 --> 43:39.617
- I heard.
[both laugh]

43:39.684 --> 43:42.587
But no, I appreciate that,
because it really does mean

43:42.653 --> 43:45.890
a lot for, you know, someone
to come in and give us both,

43:45.957 --> 43:48.126
individually, like,
our own attention.

43:48.192 --> 43:49.527
- You two
are very different.

43:49.594 --> 43:51.562
But I understand, you're, like,
on the same journey,

43:51.629 --> 43:53.631
but you have
your own separate journeys.

43:53.698 --> 43:54.866
So, like,
I wanted to come in and be

43:54.932 --> 43:57.034
able to show you
that, like, I recognize you,

43:57.101 --> 43:58.636
I recognize her
in different ways.

43:58.703 --> 44:00.505
- Yeah.
- And, like, that's

44:00.571 --> 44:01.739
kind of how I came up
with what I did.

44:01.806 --> 44:03.541
- It's perfect.
- Yeah.

44:03.608 --> 44:05.042
<i>- Tonight, at the beginning,</i>
<i>it was a little awkward</i>

44:05.109 --> 44:07.545
<i>just because</i>
<i>me and Gabby really</i>

44:07.612 --> 44:09.780
<i>don't want it</i>
<i>to be a competition.</i>

44:09.847 --> 44:12.350
Of course, Gabby and I are
in this journey together,

44:12.416 --> 44:15.987
but little moments like that
where the men are able

44:16.053 --> 44:19.657
to make me feel like
I'm the only girl there,

44:19.724 --> 44:22.260
it's important, I think,
for Gabby and I

44:22.326 --> 44:23.528
both to feel different.

44:23.594 --> 44:25.329
- All right,
so if I'm gonna ever

44:25.396 --> 44:26.564
bring you home, to Boston,

44:26.631 --> 44:28.065
to meet my friends and family,

44:28.132 --> 44:29.567
you're gonna stick out
like a sore thumb.

44:29.634 --> 44:31.169
- Oh, why? Okay.
- Unless...

44:31.235 --> 44:32.703
unless we teach you the lingo.

44:32.770 --> 44:34.372
- Oh, God.
- I know you know English,

44:34.438 --> 44:35.706
but this is different.

44:35.773 --> 44:37.508
- Barely.
- All right.

44:37.575 --> 44:38.709
So I'm gonna be a teacher.
- Oh!

44:38.776 --> 44:40.778
How did I miss that whiteboard?

44:40.845 --> 44:41.879
- If you're walking
down the street

44:41.946 --> 44:43.080
and you want to say "hi"
to someone...

44:43.147 --> 44:44.649
- Uh-huh.

44:44.715 --> 44:46.317
You write like a five-year-old.

44:47.318 --> 44:49.187
No, that's pretty good.
"Hello, good"?

44:49.253 --> 44:50.454
- Will you chill?

44:50.521 --> 44:51.689
Can you let me finish?

44:51.756 --> 44:52.857
- [laughing]

44:52.924 --> 44:56.093
- "Hello, good sir. How..."

44:56.160 --> 44:57.962
- You don't say "good sir."

44:58.029 --> 45:00.264
- So we're being very proper.
- Is Boston in like, the 1800s?

45:00.331 --> 45:01.399
- If you wanted to say this,
super proper--

45:01.465 --> 45:02.533
- People say that
with a straight face?

45:02.600 --> 45:04.435
- Gabby, Gabby, zhh, zhh.
- No, they don't.

45:04.502 --> 45:06.304
Okay, okay.
- Gabber, Gabber.

45:06.370 --> 45:07.905
Look at me. Look at me. Shh.

45:07.972 --> 45:09.073
- Okay, I'm done.

45:09.140 --> 45:10.341
- We're gonna say it
in Boston...

45:10.408 --> 45:12.710
- Uh-huh.
- This is what we do.

45:12.777 --> 45:14.378
<i>- Ryan is really fun.</i>
<i>I feel like</i>

45:14.445 --> 45:17.315
<i>we have great energy</i>
<i>right off the bat.</i>

45:17.381 --> 45:18.616
[with Boston accent]
Hey, guy, how are you?

45:18.683 --> 45:20.585
I could do that.
- Beautiful.

45:20.651 --> 45:22.386
<i>- He's super easy to talk to.</i>

45:22.453 --> 45:24.422
We can just kind of, like, give
each other a little [bleep]

45:24.488 --> 45:26.958
and just, like, overall,
enjoy his company.

45:27.024 --> 45:28.292
Do I have a booger?

45:28.359 --> 45:29.827
- No. Do you? No.

45:29.894 --> 45:31.095
- [laughs]
- You have something...

45:31.162 --> 45:32.597
- No, do I have one?

45:32.663 --> 45:33.764
- Oh, my--
- No, stop!

45:33.831 --> 45:35.299
- Gab, Gab, you gotta go.
- Do I?

45:35.366 --> 45:36.601
- Cut, cut--
no, I'm just kidding.

45:36.667 --> 45:38.436
You don't have anything.
You have nothing. Nothing.

45:38.502 --> 45:40.638
- Knowing that Ryan
is already so invested

45:40.705 --> 45:41.973
is such a good feeling.

45:42.039 --> 45:43.174
- I was so pumped to meet you

45:43.241 --> 45:44.508
because you're
absolutely hysterical.

45:44.575 --> 45:46.244
- Oh, my gosh, thank you.

45:46.310 --> 45:49.547
<i>- I can't wait to see what</i>
<i>the rest of the night brings.</i>

45:54.552 --> 45:56.187
<i>- I can't pick</i>
<i>who I like more.</i>

45:56.254 --> 45:57.555
You know, I'm really excited

45:57.622 --> 45:59.090
to just get one-on-one time
with both,

45:59.156 --> 46:01.025
get a fair shot with both,
and just see

46:01.092 --> 46:02.193
who I have
a better connection with.

46:02.260 --> 46:03.628
I think that's important.

46:03.694 --> 46:05.496
- They both have different
qualities that are amazing,

46:05.563 --> 46:07.832
so it is possible
that you could

46:07.898 --> 46:09.433
fall for both
and not even know it

46:09.500 --> 46:11.135
until you, like, wake up
one day, and like,

46:11.202 --> 46:12.970
"Man, what do I choose?"
- Especially there's two.

46:13.037 --> 46:15.072
- What do I choose?
- Yeah.

46:15.139 --> 46:16.240
- Oof!

46:16.307 --> 46:17.441
- We'll warm you up out here.

46:17.508 --> 46:19.410
- Yeah, we need a blanket
or something.

46:19.477 --> 46:21.712
The night started off
a little bit awkward,

46:21.779 --> 46:24.615
but since we've
been able to separate,

46:24.682 --> 46:27.385
<i>getting to talk to these guys</i>
<i>individually is almost</i>

46:27.451 --> 46:29.854
<i>like meeting them again</i>
<i>for the first time.</i>

46:29.920 --> 46:30.921
- I went to UCF.

46:30.988 --> 46:32.089
- No way.

46:32.156 --> 46:33.291
- And so I live in Tampa now,
though.

46:33.357 --> 46:34.859
- My brother lives in Tampa.

46:34.925 --> 46:37.094
I am really hopeful
that I'm gonna start

46:37.161 --> 46:39.130
making more
romantic connections

46:39.196 --> 46:41.799
with these guys,
because that's why I'm here

46:41.866 --> 46:43.234
and that's what
I'm looking for.

46:43.301 --> 46:45.102
- I know that
a couple of weeks ago,

46:45.169 --> 46:46.137
it was your birthday.

46:46.203 --> 46:48.272
- It was!
- Okay.

46:48.339 --> 46:49.940
So I had plenty
of time to do this.

46:50.007 --> 46:51.509
- Oh, my goodness.

46:52.977 --> 46:55.146
Oh, my--
[laughs]

46:55.212 --> 46:57.048
- I had plenty of time.
- Can I read it?

46:57.114 --> 46:58.949
- Yes, I would love for you
to read it.

46:59.016 --> 47:00.785
- "Happy birthday, Rachel.

47:00.851 --> 47:03.621
"I know your birthday
was a few weeks ago,

47:03.688 --> 47:06.324
"but it's never too late
for best wishes.

47:06.390 --> 47:08.626
"I hope your life is filled
with an abundance

47:08.693 --> 47:12.797
"of love, joy,
and most of all, me.

47:12.863 --> 47:15.533
Love, your co-pilot, Hayden."

47:15.599 --> 47:17.935
Oh, my gosh, I love it.

47:18.002 --> 47:19.804
This is so special.

47:19.870 --> 47:22.673
Oh, my goodness.
- Well, that came from heart.

47:22.740 --> 47:25.176
<i>- Hayden is so cute.</i>

47:25.242 --> 47:28.446
He really went out of his way
to let me know

47:28.512 --> 47:30.815
that he's interested
in being here for me,

47:30.881 --> 47:34.085
<i>and that makes me</i>
<i>feel so special.</i>

47:34.151 --> 47:37.021
<i>I definitely feel</i>
<i>a spark with Hayden.</i>

47:37.088 --> 47:38.622
- I've had this
for a long time, basically.

47:38.689 --> 47:40.191
It's just a list
of, like, attributes

47:40.257 --> 47:41.759
that--about a future wife.
- Aww.

47:41.826 --> 47:43.160
- I'm not sure
if you have one of these.

47:43.227 --> 47:45.596
It's kind of cringy,
but then I'm like, all right.

47:45.663 --> 47:47.965
- No, that's okay.
No, I appreciate the effort.

47:48.032 --> 47:49.700
I feel like it's important
to think about these things,

47:49.767 --> 47:51.969
for sure, especially going into
something like this where...

47:52.036 --> 47:53.137
- Oh, my gosh.
- You know, you don't really

47:53.204 --> 47:54.271
know what you're going into.

47:54.338 --> 47:55.773
- Well, I don't know,
at the same time,

47:55.840 --> 47:57.475
like, are we gonna be good
together?

47:57.541 --> 47:58.776
- Totally.
- Is there things

47:58.843 --> 48:01.846
that are going to, you know,
branch out for us?

48:01.912 --> 48:03.414
Like,
this is not just a first date.

48:03.481 --> 48:05.850
It's, like, almost like
a first everything.

48:05.916 --> 48:08.185
So I'll kind of go over these.
- Right, right.

48:08.252 --> 48:11.021
- So the first attribute
of a future partner is,

48:11.088 --> 48:13.424
is open and honest
with her feelings.

48:13.491 --> 48:16.560
They are intentional
in everything that they do.

48:16.627 --> 48:18.662
Takes care
of herself physically.

48:18.729 --> 48:20.498
So hopefully you take care--

48:20.564 --> 48:22.166
[both laugh]
I mean...

48:22.233 --> 48:25.469
<i>- Shirtless Jacob,</i>
<i>his pecs are rock-hard.</i>

48:25.536 --> 48:27.671
- Lives a very passionate life.

48:27.738 --> 48:29.440
- I can't stop looking at 'em.

48:30.841 --> 48:32.610
- Yeah, and then has
a good sense of humor.

48:32.676 --> 48:35.112
So obviously, I think
we're good on that part, maybe.

48:35.179 --> 48:36.414
- Yeah.

48:36.480 --> 48:37.415
He's great.

48:37.481 --> 48:40.918
He came to our conversation

48:40.985 --> 48:42.753
very intentional,

48:42.820 --> 48:45.756
<i>which is nice, but he was</i>
<i>way more shy than I thought.</i>

48:45.823 --> 48:47.191
I thought they were
gonna be kissing

48:47.258 --> 48:49.326
all over the place,
but they haven't.

48:49.393 --> 48:52.530
- I guess, isn't afraid
of physical touch.

48:52.596 --> 48:53.531
- Yeah.
- So, I mean...

48:53.597 --> 48:56.267
[laughter]

48:56.333 --> 48:57.568
- I'm terrified. No.

48:57.635 --> 48:59.470
- Yeah, yeah, of course.
- Yeah.

48:59.537 --> 49:01.505
<i>I think</i>
<i>physical chemistry means</i>

49:01.572 --> 49:03.073
<i>so much,</i>
<i>especially when you're dating,</i>

49:03.140 --> 49:05.276
<i>in order to, like,</i>
<i>keep the attraction.</i>

49:05.342 --> 49:07.978
<i>So I feel like kissing</i>
<i>is really important.</i>

49:08.045 --> 49:10.047
- Like, you think
anyone's kissed them yet?

49:10.114 --> 49:12.416
I'd kiss both of them, but I
don't know how that would work.

49:12.483 --> 49:14.718
- Yeah.
- Before I kiss one of them,

49:14.785 --> 49:16.554
I gotta figure out
which one I like.

49:16.620 --> 49:18.355
'cause I'm not gonna play.
I'm not gonna play with them.

49:18.422 --> 49:20.624
- It's a delicate process
where you can't

49:20.691 --> 49:22.293
come on too strong,
but you have to be a little bit

49:22.359 --> 49:25.029
selfish and just be you
to figure out, like,

49:25.095 --> 49:26.864
is there
that instant chemistry?

49:26.931 --> 49:28.299
- You know, one thing
I definitely wanted

49:28.365 --> 49:30.868
to let you know up front is,
you know what you said

49:30.935 --> 49:34.038
inside about kinda opening up
and vulnerability?

49:34.104 --> 49:35.239
- It's very important to me.

49:35.306 --> 49:36.640
- It's very important,
yeah, I know.

49:36.707 --> 49:38.476
But it's like,
it's always been kind of tough

49:38.542 --> 49:41.045
for me to do that early on.
- Okay.

49:41.111 --> 49:43.447
- But I want you to know that,
you know, I'm here for you.

49:43.514 --> 49:44.882
- Yeah.
- And I'm willing

49:44.949 --> 49:46.283
to kind of meet you there.

49:46.350 --> 49:47.785
And it might
take me a little bit

49:47.852 --> 49:48.853
longer than some
of the other people...

49:48.919 --> 49:50.354
- We'll work on it.
- We'll try.

49:50.421 --> 49:52.456
But, you know,
I'm gonna give it my absolute,

49:52.523 --> 49:54.525
100% best
when it comes to that.

49:54.592 --> 49:58.028
<i>- I really liked Aven</i>
<i>right off the bat.</i>

49:58.095 --> 49:59.997
Kind of wearing your heart
on your sleeve,

50:00.064 --> 50:02.132
even when it's scary.
- I know.

50:02.199 --> 50:06.270
<i>- He definitely was inching</i>
<i>a little bit closer to me...</i>

50:06.337 --> 50:08.572
- I'm just--I'm like,
oh, my gosh,

50:08.639 --> 50:10.474
I really, really hope
this experience is

50:10.541 --> 50:12.843
so much better
for the both of you.

50:12.910 --> 50:14.178
- Yeah.

50:14.245 --> 50:15.179
- That must have been a lot.

50:15.246 --> 50:17.481
<i>[romantic music]</i>

50:17.548 --> 50:19.083
<i>- But there was no kiss.</i>

50:19.149 --> 50:20.818
- It was so great
to talk to you.

50:20.885 --> 50:22.720
- Maybe it just wasn't
the right moment.

50:22.786 --> 50:24.221
Maybe he was nervous.

50:24.288 --> 50:26.991
<i>I'm not sure</i>
<i>what's going on with him,</i>

50:27.057 --> 50:28.359
but I, at least for me,

50:28.425 --> 50:29.827
thought it was
a good conversation.

50:29.894 --> 50:31.695
- So I understand
that you're a pilot.

50:31.762 --> 50:34.231
- I am.
- Right, and that's super cool.

50:34.298 --> 50:36.133
So me being a race car driver,

50:36.200 --> 50:39.236
I might have brought
my actual race car.

50:39.303 --> 50:40.738
- Oh, my goodness!
- To show you.

50:40.804 --> 50:42.006
- Whoa!

50:42.072 --> 50:43.274
- This is what's called
a Top Fuel dragster.

50:43.340 --> 50:44.642
- Oh, my goodness.

50:44.708 --> 50:46.410
- So this is the car
that I drive.

50:46.477 --> 50:48.512
- So you sit...
- Right in here.

50:48.579 --> 50:49.880
- Oh, my God.

50:51.048 --> 50:53.417
- So that's where I sit.
- Whoa!

50:53.484 --> 50:54.785
- Here's my controls
in here, so...

50:54.852 --> 50:55.853
- Okay.

50:55.920 --> 50:57.087
- So these two levers
right here

50:57.154 --> 50:59.123
are the parachutes, so I go--

50:59.189 --> 51:00.824
- Wait, so you go,
like, really fast

51:00.891 --> 51:02.726
and then the parachutes
go out the back?

51:02.793 --> 51:05.095
- I've gone 330 miles an hour.
- Are you serious?

51:05.162 --> 51:06.797
- This thing goes
330 miles an hour.

51:06.864 --> 51:07.865
- Oh, my goodness.

51:07.932 --> 51:09.466
- It's pretty big, though,
isn't it?

51:09.533 --> 51:12.136
With you being a pilot and all,
you know, you spent hours

51:12.202 --> 51:14.638
and hours learning
how to fly a plane, you know,

51:14.705 --> 51:16.006
learning the controls,
all that sort of thing.

51:16.073 --> 51:18.142
So, you know,
I kind of did the same thing.

51:18.208 --> 51:20.344
And so when you drive
one of these things,

51:20.411 --> 51:22.246
you have to learn
what the controls are,

51:22.313 --> 51:23.447
all those kind of things.

51:23.514 --> 51:25.015
So hopefully one day,
you can show me

51:25.082 --> 51:27.217
how to fly a plane,
and one day I can

51:27.284 --> 51:28.252
show you how to drive
this thing.

51:28.319 --> 51:29.820
- Absolutely!

51:29.887 --> 51:32.590
<i>- Jordan V.</i>
<i>really surprised me.</i>

51:32.656 --> 51:36.560
I enjoyed our conversation,
and I feel like,

51:36.627 --> 51:39.396
in a way,
we do have a lot in common.

51:39.463 --> 51:41.765
Wow, I'm very impressed by you.

51:42.833 --> 51:43.867
- I'm impressed by you.

51:43.934 --> 51:45.436
- Oh, thank you.

51:45.502 --> 51:46.670
- I came here for you, so...

51:46.737 --> 51:48.672
- Oh, for me? Really?

51:48.739 --> 51:49.773
- Yes.

51:51.609 --> 51:53.077
I don't know if you're
familiar with horsepower,

51:53.143 --> 51:55.112
but it makes
11,000 horsepower, so...

51:55.179 --> 51:58.215
- Oh, my goodness. Wow.

51:58.282 --> 52:02.252
<i>I was a little bit surprised</i>
<i>that Jordan didn't kiss me.</i>

52:02.319 --> 52:04.788
<i>I thought</i>
<i>the moment was right,</i>

52:04.855 --> 52:06.156
<i>but, I mean,</i>

52:06.223 --> 52:08.592
it is only night one, but...

52:10.361 --> 52:11.929
Clayton kissed me on night one.

52:11.996 --> 52:13.163
- I noticed
when you guys were in there,

52:13.230 --> 52:14.798
one of the things you said,
you were like,

52:14.865 --> 52:17.534
just to kind of be
more open and honest

52:17.601 --> 52:19.737
right now,
like, to be vulnerable.

52:19.803 --> 52:21.205
And that's, like,
a part of the journey.

52:21.271 --> 52:23.641
And then you guys were like,
"Cheers up to that!" right?

52:23.707 --> 52:25.676
And I was like "Oh, okay."
- Yeah. Do it now!

52:25.743 --> 52:27.778
- But, like, what does that,
like, look like for you?

52:27.845 --> 52:29.813
Considering, you know,
Clayton was like, "I love you."

52:29.880 --> 52:31.415
- Right, right.
- And then you fell through.

52:31.482 --> 52:33.917
How has your lens
changed in that area?

52:34.018 --> 52:36.887
- For me, it took me--
I definitely got there,

52:36.954 --> 52:38.489
but it took me
a little bit of time

52:38.555 --> 52:41.325
to be more vulnerable

52:41.392 --> 52:43.394
and kind of share my story

52:43.460 --> 52:45.396
and have faith in myself

52:45.462 --> 52:47.398
and the relationship
that I was building.

52:47.464 --> 52:48.866
- Yeah.
- I think it's so important

52:48.932 --> 52:50.200
to just, like, trust your gut

52:50.267 --> 52:52.269
and know
what you have to offer.

52:52.336 --> 52:53.404
- Absolutely.
I just want you to know

52:53.470 --> 52:54.805
I'm coming to you
with a open heart.

52:54.872 --> 52:56.573
I think, naturally,
as, like, a man,

52:56.640 --> 52:58.142
you know, I think
in our culture today, like,

52:58.208 --> 53:00.911
there's this stigma that,
like, men are just closed off,

53:00.978 --> 53:02.780
like, you know,
they have walls up,

53:02.846 --> 53:04.381
but I'm willing
to be vulnerable...

53:04.448 --> 53:05.616
- Yeah.
- And to just be

53:05.683 --> 53:07.084
present-minded with you,
you know what I'm saying?

53:07.151 --> 53:08.285
- Totally.
And that's a good sentiment.

53:08.352 --> 53:09.420
- Just not, like,
going through the motions.

53:09.486 --> 53:10.654
You know
what I'm saying, right?

53:10.721 --> 53:11.989

hey, you take care."

53:12.056 --> 53:13.057
You know what I'm saying?

53:13.123 --> 53:14.625
- You just hit my reflex
in my knee.

53:14.692 --> 53:16.427

just kick off?

53:16.493 --> 53:18.696
Also, I'm a doctor.

59:55.092 --> 59:56.159
- Okay.

59:56.226 --> 59:57.994
I'm dying to know
your biggest fear.

59:58.061 --> 59:59.763
- My biggest fear?
- Your biggest fear.

59:59.830 --> 1:00:00.931
Okay, on three, ready?

1:00:00.997 --> 1:00:02.165
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna say mine too.

1:00:02.232 --> 1:00:04.234
- Okay.
both: One, two, three.

1:00:04.301 --> 1:00:05.368
- Clowns.
- Sharks.

1:00:05.435 --> 1:00:06.736
Clowns?
- Sharks?

1:00:06.803 --> 1:00:08.105
- Okay,
I've heard there was, like,

1:00:08.171 --> 1:00:11.241
a couple clowns, like,
during the entrances today.

1:00:11.308 --> 1:00:13.410
So were you just terrified
out of your mind?

1:00:13.477 --> 1:00:16.012
- Wait, you're smooth.
That was a good one.

1:00:16.079 --> 1:00:18.582
<i>I am very attracted to Logan.</i>

1:00:18.648 --> 1:00:20.584
<i>He made me laugh.</i>

I think
we're both very spontaneous.

1:00:23.353 --> 1:00:25.255
This is my first time
really out in California.

1:00:25.322 --> 1:00:26.990
- Yeah.
But I've always kind of wanted

1:00:27.057 --> 1:00:29.459
to see the Pacific Northwest,
as well, Washington...

1:00:29.526 --> 1:00:31.094
- Seattle.
- Yeah.

1:00:31.161 --> 1:00:32.429
- You busy in the next
couple weeks?

1:00:32.496 --> 1:00:33.730
- I don't know.
- You think we can make time?

1:00:33.797 --> 1:00:35.165
- Maybe.

1:00:35.232 --> 1:00:37.200
- I think maybe we could, like,
figure something out.

1:00:37.267 --> 1:00:39.836
<i>I was really happy</i>
<i>the way it went with Rachel.</i>

1:00:39.903 --> 1:00:41.605

a real connection.

1:00:52.949 --> 1:00:55.352
- Did you speak with both?
- No, gosh.

1:00:55.418 --> 1:00:57.087
If I spoke with both,
that'd be pretty impressive.

1:00:57.154 --> 1:00:58.855
I don't think anybody has.

1:00:58.922 --> 1:01:01.658
- How are you tonight?
- I'm good. How are you?

1:01:01.725 --> 1:01:02.726
- I'm doing so well.

1:01:02.792 --> 1:01:03.960
- Where are your chicks?

1:01:04.027 --> 1:01:05.662
- The chicks.
- Did you ditch them for me?

1:01:05.729 --> 1:01:07.097
- They had
a little too much to drink.

1:01:07.164 --> 1:01:09.166
I had to call them a cab home.

1:01:09.232 --> 1:01:12.102

to, like, learn about you.

1:01:15.172 --> 1:01:17.340

kicked out of the house

1:01:17.407 --> 1:01:19.509

double bottled up...

1:01:19.576 --> 1:01:21.778

- Yeah.

Okay, so are you the type
of person who goes into a movie

and buys candy
at the concessions stand?

1:01:29.853 --> 1:01:30.987
- Oh.

1:01:31.054 --> 1:01:32.289
- Or do you bring,
like, a trench coat...

1:01:32.355 --> 1:01:34.524
- Right.
- And, like, stuff everything

1:01:34.591 --> 1:01:36.693
in the pockets
and kind of sneak in?

1:01:36.760 --> 1:01:38.762
- Yeah, the trench coat.
- The trench coat?

1:01:38.828 --> 1:01:40.997
- Like, a whole sandwich.
- God, I'm so relieved.

1:01:41.064 --> 1:01:42.732

Like, hot dinner food.

Yeah, I don't know.

- Not that, but...
- Okay.

about the mullet, by the way?

1:02:22.138 --> 1:02:24.074
- But it was--
oh, I love a mullet.

1:02:24.140 --> 1:02:25.208

- Uh-huh.

to be honest with you.

It's also fake.
