01:59.352 --> 02:01.513
Good evening,
you lucky college perverts.

02:01.688 --> 02:03.019
This is Howard Stern.

02:03.189 --> 02:04.816
You're not Howard Stern.

02:04.991 --> 02:06.959
You're my landlord, Mr. Pitts.

02:07.127 --> 02:10.358
Don't look at me, sweetheart.
It's your dream.

02:11.030 --> 02:14.591
And with me in the studio
is Donna Martin.

02:17.303 --> 02:21.034
I should mention,
you look really fabulous, Donna.

02:21.508 --> 02:24.739
I had no idea
you were this attractive.

02:24.911 --> 02:28.312
Is everything that I'm seeing
for real?

02:28.481 --> 02:30.039
Yes.

02:30.216 --> 02:31.911
What are you doing here?

02:32.085 --> 02:35.486
Well, besides plugging my book,
I'm here because your audience

02:35.655 --> 02:39.785
keeps calling my show,
all asking the same wacky question.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.184
What's that?

02:41.361 --> 02:44.694
Why are you still a virgin?

02:45.565 --> 02:47.328
That's none of your business.

02:47.500 --> 02:48.797
Why, Donna, why?

02:49.669 --> 02:51.330
- Why, Donna, why?
- Stop it.

02:52.272 --> 02:53.432
Go away.

02:54.707 --> 02:57.699
- Donna, Donna, Donna...
- Stop it.

02:57.877 --> 02:58.935
Donna.

03:00.446 --> 03:02.311
Donna.

03:04.717 --> 03:07.242
David, what are you doing?

03:07.420 --> 03:09.445
Happy anniversary.

03:10.557 --> 03:12.752
I remembered you said
French tulips were your favorite,

03:12.926 --> 03:16.862
so I found a shop
right off campus that opens early.

03:17.030 --> 03:20.158
They're beautiful. Thank you.

03:22.669 --> 03:26.935
So two years ago tonight,
Christmas dance at West Beverly.

03:27.106 --> 03:29.404
I still can't believe you were willing
to go out with me.

03:29.576 --> 03:31.669
Well, I can't believe it either.

03:31.844 --> 03:35.780
And then,
we got on the dance floor...

03:35.949 --> 03:37.507
And I realized that I loved you.

03:37.684 --> 03:40.448
And I didn't care
what anyone else thought.

03:42.021 --> 03:44.080
I should go put these in some water
before they wilt.

03:44.257 --> 03:45.554
You have to do that right now?

03:45.725 --> 03:46.749
Oh, it's so hot out today.

03:46.926 --> 03:48.621
I think it's gonna be like 90 degrees.

03:48.795 --> 03:50.695
Yeah, well, the Santa Anas
kicked up last night.

03:50.863 --> 03:52.888
We're already on fire watch
in the canyon.

03:53.066 --> 03:55.466
But, so far,
everything seems to be under control.

03:55.635 --> 03:57.500
That's a relief.

03:57.670 --> 04:03.199
You know, the winds tend
to affect people in strange ways.

04:03.376 --> 04:06.277
Oh, gosh, don't I know it?
My mom, she gets so irritable.

04:06.446 --> 04:09.415
My dad, he doesn't sleep
for, like, two or three days.

04:09.916 --> 04:13.647
Yeah, well, they affect me
a little bit different.

04:14.587 --> 04:17.555
Come on, Donna, it's a special day.
Don't you feel it?

04:18.891 --> 04:21.916
Before, was I talking in my sleep?

04:22.095 --> 04:23.790
No. Why?

04:23.963 --> 04:27.364
Good. I should go put these
in some water.

04:31.070 --> 04:32.935
- Hey, my best pal.
- Hey, Nat.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.300
How you doing? Good to be back.

04:34.474 --> 04:36.339
- Everyone's been missing you.
- So I hear.

04:36.509 --> 04:38.272
- Yeah, especially your folks.
- Yeah, right.

04:38.444 --> 04:40.469
What's this I hear
about Emily Valentine?

04:40.647 --> 04:42.512
- How did that turn out?
- Good.

04:42.682 --> 04:44.343
- Yeah?
- So, what's up?

04:44.517 --> 04:46.041
More like who's down?

04:46.219 --> 04:48.312
It's a definite code blue.

04:48.488 --> 04:50.786
Go and do your stuff.

04:52.258 --> 04:54.453
Hey, pal, I bring you much cheer
and good fortune.

04:54.627 --> 04:56.254
Hey, Bran.

04:56.429 --> 04:59.557
So how is Emily Valentine?

05:00.433 --> 05:01.525
Good.

05:01.701 --> 05:03.862
Good?
All you have to say is "good"?

05:04.037 --> 05:05.698
I didn't come here
to talk about me, Steve.

05:05.872 --> 05:08.306
Your message said it was urgent.
What happened to you?

05:08.474 --> 05:10.999
KEG hell week happened to me.

05:11.177 --> 05:12.371
Started off all fun and games,

05:12.545 --> 05:15.139
but at the end,
we had this pledge scavenger hunt.

05:15.315 --> 05:16.577
You busted out of the KEG House?

05:16.849 --> 05:19.477
I got busted,
breaking into Randall's office.

05:19.852 --> 05:20.978
Are you serious?

05:21.154 --> 05:23.679
I was supposed to retrieve
some autographed baseball.

05:23.856 --> 05:25.551
Gotta see the dean on Monday.

05:26.659 --> 05:28.286
Steve, I love you, man,

05:28.461 --> 05:31.624
but if you were any dumber,
you'd require fertilizer.

05:32.098 --> 05:34.123
Why did you even have to
join a fraternity anyway?

05:34.300 --> 05:37.360
Hey, being part of this fraternity
is something I'm very proud of, okay?

05:37.537 --> 05:39.266
Those guys are my brothers.

05:39.439 --> 05:41.999
You wanna make fun of me? Fine.
Don't go bagging on the KEG House,

05:42.175 --> 05:44.302
- okay?
- Okay, okay.

05:44.477 --> 05:47.275
I gotta tell you, man.
It's getting pretty tired.

05:47.447 --> 05:50.177
Me having a best friend who's always
getting in so much trouble.

05:50.883 --> 05:53.147
Would it be too much to ask you
for a favor, Brando?

05:53.853 --> 05:54.877
What do you want me to do?

05:56.255 --> 05:58.155
Well, you're buddy-buddy
with Randall.

05:58.324 --> 06:00.417
Maybe you could talk to him.
Maybe he'll let me slide.

06:00.593 --> 06:01.924
Steve, I can't do that.

06:02.095 --> 06:05.531
I'm in no position
to ask Randall for any favors.

06:05.698 --> 06:07.097
Can't your brothers help you out?

06:07.800 --> 06:09.563
We're gonna have a meeting
about this tonight.

06:09.736 --> 06:11.135
Then relax.

06:11.304 --> 06:13.329
They got you into this,
they'll get you out, right?

06:14.574 --> 06:18.032
Thanks, Brando.
I knew I could count on you for this.

06:22.081 --> 06:25.778
You know, having dinner in Chinatown
is a great way to do your anniversary.

06:25.952 --> 06:28.853
Yeah, and I really want it to be
a celebration. And I love Chinatown.

06:29.021 --> 06:32.013
Me too. It always feels like
you've traveled to a different country.

06:32.191 --> 06:33.749
I know,
and you don't even have to pack.

06:35.161 --> 06:37.288
It's just too bad Andrea and Steve
can't make it.

06:37.463 --> 06:39.226
Yeah, I guess they're tied up.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.162
Well, at least you and Dylan
will be there.

06:41.334 --> 06:43.393
Not as a couple.

06:44.170 --> 06:45.296
This is hopeless.

06:45.471 --> 06:49.202
Yeah, I know. It's the desert winds,
dries up everything.

06:49.909 --> 06:53.174
Kel, you know what?
I had the weirdest dream last night.

06:53.346 --> 06:55.337
I dreamt that I was
in the broadcast booth

06:55.515 --> 06:57.244
and I was doing the show.

06:57.417 --> 07:01.478
Except I wasn't doing it with David.
I was doing it with Howard Stern.

07:01.654 --> 07:03.519
Howard Stern?

07:03.689 --> 07:08.058
Well, actually, it was our landlord
pretending to be Howard Stern.

07:08.227 --> 07:09.524
Mr. Pitts.

07:09.695 --> 07:13.893
Yeah, he was interviewing me
like I was the last American virgin.

07:14.066 --> 07:15.533
And he was laughing at me.

07:15.701 --> 07:18.966
God, two weirdoes in one dream.

07:22.308 --> 07:23.536
The happy wanderer returns.

07:23.709 --> 07:26.405
- Hey, how's it going, brother?
- It's going.

07:26.579 --> 07:27.910
How's Emily Valentine?

07:28.080 --> 07:29.138
She's good.

07:29.315 --> 07:32.148
- She's good?
- That's what I said.

07:32.318 --> 07:33.342
Well?

07:33.519 --> 07:34.543
Hey...

07:36.022 --> 07:37.717
A- plus. Why am I not surprised?

07:37.890 --> 07:40.484
Well, to tell you the truth,
I was expecting a failing grade.

07:40.660 --> 07:43.527
- A workhorse like you? Lmpossible.
- Between the professor, his wife

07:43.696 --> 07:45.755
and the basketball player
I'm supposedly tutoring,

07:45.932 --> 07:48.196
I'm learning more in this course
than I bargained for.

07:48.367 --> 07:49.959
Can't be too tough.
Sanders got a B-plus.

07:50.136 --> 07:52.070
That's not the most amazing grade
on that sheet.

07:52.238 --> 07:56.038
D'Shawn Hardell got a B-plus
without even opening one single book.

07:56.209 --> 07:58.143
It's good to be back
at old Hypocrisy U.

07:58.911 --> 08:00.640
Welcome home.

08:00.813 --> 08:03.782
So, what about tonight, bro?
You heading down to Chinatown too?

08:03.950 --> 08:05.645
Yeah, I'll be on my best behavior.

08:05.818 --> 08:07.718
I didn't realize
you had a discipline problem.

08:07.887 --> 08:09.013
What, Brenda didn't tell you?

08:09.188 --> 08:11.179
Me and Kelly,
Thanksgiving Day in your living room,

08:11.357 --> 08:12.881
we had a scene.
It bordered on the ugly.

08:13.059 --> 08:15.960
No, all she talked about
was her unnaked triumph in her play.

08:16.128 --> 08:18.289
Yeah, well, Bren may wanna have
her repeat performance.

08:18.464 --> 08:19.624
I, however, do not.

08:19.799 --> 08:24.702
So if Kelly and I can get through
this thing and just be civil, I'm happy.

08:27.106 --> 08:29.631
- Okay, ready to go?
- Just about.

08:32.410 --> 08:35.437
You know, we never got to talk
about San Francisco.

08:35.914 --> 08:38.645
- How did it go with Emily?
- Good.

08:39.352 --> 08:42.150
It must have been better than good
for you to skip out on Thanksgiving.

08:42.321 --> 08:45.722
You know, I really wish everyone
would stop asking me about Emily.

08:45.892 --> 08:48.861
If I wanted to talk about it,
I would have.

08:49.028 --> 08:51.758
Okay, if you don't wanna
confide in me,

08:51.931 --> 08:54.798
clearly, it was something
incredibly personal.

08:54.967 --> 08:58.733
Something you wouldn't even tell
your twin sister. Something amazing.

08:59.338 --> 09:00.862
Yes, it was amazing.

09:01.040 --> 09:03.736
It was one of the best weeks
of my whole life.

09:03.910 --> 09:05.309
Now she's disappeared.

09:05.478 --> 09:06.638
Into thin air?

09:07.079 --> 09:09.741
No, into France,
to study marine biology.

09:12.985 --> 09:14.577
You know, I really love that girl.

09:18.858 --> 09:20.257
What?

09:21.360 --> 09:22.554
I can't wait to tell everyone.

09:22.728 --> 09:24.093
No, I don't think you'll be telling

09:24.263 --> 09:26.959
- anybody anything.
- Brandon, I'm kidding.

09:29.402 --> 09:30.630
I'm glad you're home.

09:31.437 --> 09:32.768
Yeah, me too.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.507
Come on, let's get out of here.

09:38.144 --> 09:39.975
Come on, Ryan,
you gotta help me out here.

09:40.146 --> 09:42.341
There's just no easy way to put this.
My hands are tied.

09:42.515 --> 09:44.312
Can't you tell the dean
it won't happen again?

09:44.483 --> 09:46.383
Except hazing is illegal on campus.

09:46.552 --> 09:47.849
Yeah, but everybody does it.

09:48.020 --> 09:50.488
Only this year, the Progressives
are running the student senate

09:50.656 --> 09:52.089
and they're gunning for us.

09:52.258 --> 09:53.748
Man, we just can't get involved.

09:53.926 --> 09:55.894
Great. So where does that
leave me, huh?

09:56.062 --> 09:58.121
And I can't even tell anybody
why I was there, can I?

09:58.297 --> 10:00.788
The fate of the house
is riding on you, man.

10:00.967 --> 10:03.527
It's not fair. We should be able
to do something to help Sanders.

10:03.703 --> 10:05.193
He was just doing what he was told.

10:05.371 --> 10:07.396
John, nobody feels worse
about this than me.

10:07.573 --> 10:10.007
Let's not blow this
out of proportion, okay?

10:10.176 --> 10:12.167
It's a first offense,
he'll probably get off with...

10:12.345 --> 10:13.539
With what? A slap on the wrist?

10:15.481 --> 10:19.474
But the bigger question
is will you cover for your brothers?

10:19.652 --> 10:22.621
Yeah, of course.
What choice do I have?

10:24.223 --> 10:27.715
All right, we're gonna have to distance
ourselves from you for a while.

10:27.893 --> 10:31.522
We have to put you on probation
till Monday, can you handle that?

10:31.697 --> 10:32.721
Yeah.

10:34.500 --> 10:37.094
Sanders, we may have had
our differences in the past,

10:37.269 --> 10:39.533
but you're one huge stud.

10:51.784 --> 10:53.615
This is from Brandon and me.
Happy anniversary.

10:53.786 --> 10:56.118
- Oh, you guys shouldn't have.
- But we're happy you did.

10:56.288 --> 10:59.121
Well, we saw it in a little poster shop
in Westwood

10:59.291 --> 11:02.954
and gosh darn it if it didn't remind us
of the two of you kids.

11:03.129 --> 11:04.187
What is this?

11:04.363 --> 11:07.457
Oh, yeah. That's us, all right.

11:07.633 --> 11:09.999
Good old Ma and Pa
down on the farm.

11:10.670 --> 11:13.400
Well, you two
are the only married couple here.

11:13.572 --> 11:16.302
Absolutely. And role model
for an entire generation.

11:16.475 --> 11:18.466
We're definitely gonna hang this
over the fireplace.

11:18.644 --> 11:21.010
- Possibly in it, if I can help it.
- David.

11:21.180 --> 11:22.272
I don't know about you guys,

11:22.448 --> 11:25.076
but I'm definitely not gonna scoff
at a little bit of good fortune.

11:25.251 --> 11:26.718
You know, I learned this great game

11:26.886 --> 11:29.650
when I was in San Francisco
in this dim sum restaurant.

11:29.822 --> 11:33.087
After anybody says a fortune,
everybody adds two words to it.

11:33.259 --> 11:36.057
- What words?
- "In bed. "

11:36.796 --> 11:37.922
Oh, I'll go first.

11:41.233 --> 11:43.599
"You can obtain any goal
you choose. "

11:44.170 --> 11:45.262
In bed.

11:47.440 --> 11:48.930
Yeah, just ask Stuart Carson.

11:50.109 --> 11:52.475
"You have the power
to influence many people. "

11:52.645 --> 11:53.771
In bed.

11:53.946 --> 11:56.039
Whoa, Dylan.

11:57.683 --> 11:59.514
What about you, Donna?
Why don't you go next?

11:59.685 --> 12:01.152
Okay.

12:03.222 --> 12:05.850
"You'll be starting
on a new adventure. "

12:06.025 --> 12:07.049
In bed.

12:07.226 --> 12:09.319
- Young David Silver, name him.
- Name him.

12:09.495 --> 12:10.792
- Thank you, good night.
- I wish.

12:10.963 --> 12:12.123
Peace, peace, peace.

12:13.165 --> 12:15.190
- Oh, that's all right.
- See if you can get it in.

12:15.367 --> 12:17.927
- Oh, you make a wish.
- Oh, no.

12:18.104 --> 12:20.937
Be careful. It's very, very slippery.

12:21.107 --> 12:23.575
Hey, wait, before we leave,
the anniversary couple

12:23.743 --> 12:26.075
has to make one wish
in the fountain before we leave.

12:26.245 --> 12:28.236
- Yeah, go for it, Donna.
- Okay.

12:28.414 --> 12:30.644
- Here you go.
- All right.

12:30.816 --> 12:32.306
All right.

12:33.686 --> 12:36.154
Look, David. I got love.

12:36.322 --> 12:38.119
Okay, my turn.

12:40.059 --> 12:41.890
Well, well, well.
Could it be that young Silver

12:42.061 --> 12:43.528
is gonna get lucky tonight?

12:43.696 --> 12:45.823
From your mouth to God's ears.

12:45.998 --> 12:48.558
Oh, I don't know, luck, love...

12:48.734 --> 12:50.395
Do I see a pattern developing here?

12:50.569 --> 12:51.866
Oh, speaking of patterns.

12:52.037 --> 12:54.528
The Christmas dance is going on
at West Beverly tonight.

12:54.707 --> 12:58.507
And David and I thought we'd stop by,
kind of relive the old magic.

12:58.677 --> 12:59.735
Is everyone up for it?

12:59.912 --> 13:01.812
Donna, I didn't wanna go
to high school dances

13:01.981 --> 13:03.312
when I was in high school.

13:03.482 --> 13:04.676
Why would I wanna go now?

13:04.850 --> 13:06.579
Donna, it's gonna take
a couple of more years

13:06.752 --> 13:08.743
for me to become nostalgic
for old West Bev.

13:08.921 --> 13:11.287
I don't think so. Sorry.

13:12.691 --> 13:13.988
I'll pass.

13:14.160 --> 13:16.594
Oh, come on, you guys.
Don't you wanna be with us?

13:16.762 --> 13:18.753
I think they want us
to be by ourselves.

13:18.931 --> 13:21.092
- Say good night, Donna.
- Good night, Donna.

13:21.267 --> 13:23.235
Thanks, guys, for everything.

13:23.402 --> 13:24.801
- Bye, see you later.
- Bye.

13:24.970 --> 13:26.301
- Have fun.
- Bye, baby.

13:26.472 --> 13:28.303
Bye. Bye.

13:28.474 --> 13:30.032
Later, Silver.

13:30.209 --> 13:33.701
So, Kel, are you gonna be needing
a ride home?

13:34.313 --> 13:36.042
No, I'll take her. You guys go ahead.

13:36.215 --> 13:38.615
Sure it's okay
to leave you two here alone together?

13:39.518 --> 13:40.849
Think you can handle it?

13:41.353 --> 13:42.752
I'm fine.

13:43.155 --> 13:44.588
You got nothing to worry about.

13:45.257 --> 13:47.384
- See you later.
- Bye.

13:47.560 --> 13:49.755
- Bye.
- Good night, Kel.

13:56.569 --> 13:58.332
I don't know what it is
about the Santa Anas,

13:58.504 --> 14:00.438
but I haven't been myself all day.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.206
Maybe it's not the Santa Anas.

14:03.375 --> 14:05.639
Maybe I'm just nervous
about being with you.

14:07.313 --> 14:10.544
In the Middle East, they have winds.
They're called the siroccos.

14:10.716 --> 14:12.547
They blow across
the northern desert of Africa.

14:12.718 --> 14:15.846
And while these winds are blowing,
if you kill somebody,

14:16.021 --> 14:17.545
they won't even try to punish you.

14:18.657 --> 14:21.421
Sort of like temporary insanity.

14:21.594 --> 14:24.062
Kind of like the heat of passion.

14:25.231 --> 14:27.062
Sort of like a full moon.

14:27.233 --> 14:28.666
Our bodies are full
of so much water

14:28.834 --> 14:31.928
that gravity starts pulling on us
in ways we don't even realize.

14:33.239 --> 14:35.639
It's like a tide rising.

14:49.822 --> 14:52.518
- Bless you.
- Thanks.

14:54.827 --> 14:56.260
Bless you.

14:56.428 --> 15:00.489
Thank you, David, but you don't have
to keep saying "bless you" anymore.

15:02.001 --> 15:03.559
I had a wonderful time tonight.

15:03.736 --> 15:07.001
You know, it was just like
the first time all over again.

15:10.876 --> 15:12.810
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

15:12.978 --> 15:15.105
It's just my allergies,
with the winds and everything.

15:15.281 --> 15:16.771
Must be all the pollen in the air.

15:16.949 --> 15:20.248
Yeah. You know, I should really go
take an antihistamine.

15:20.419 --> 15:21.750
No, don't. They put you to sleep.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.752
Sorry.

15:26.158 --> 15:27.853
Bless you.

15:31.897 --> 15:34.593
It was great meeting Grandma Rose.

15:34.767 --> 15:37.167
You know, when you asked
for a second helping on those latkes,

15:37.336 --> 15:38.701
you won her heart forever.

15:38.871 --> 15:41.533
And why not? They're delicious.

15:41.707 --> 15:44.972
I can't believe you bought me
a baseball glove for Hanukkah.

15:45.144 --> 15:47.612
Well, if you're gonna hang around me,
you're gonna need it.

15:47.780 --> 15:52.615
Oh, I see. So it's more than a gift?

15:52.785 --> 15:54.446
Better believe it.

16:25.718 --> 16:27.777
It's getting late.

16:28.053 --> 16:29.782
Yeah.

16:29.955 --> 16:32.651
I've got a lot of reading to do.

16:34.126 --> 16:35.616
I'll see you tomorrow?

16:35.794 --> 16:37.193
Yeah.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.147
Bye.

17:01.487 --> 17:02.715
Good night.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.325
Good night.

17:13.531 --> 17:16.092
Welcome back to the second part
of my exposé

17:16.268 --> 17:17.997
on the last American virgin.

17:18.170 --> 17:23.300
With me are Donna's parents,
Dr. And Mrs. Martin from Houston.

17:23.474 --> 17:24.499
Hi, Howard.

17:24.675 --> 17:25.938
Very nice to be here.

17:26.111 --> 17:29.512
And in the hot seat
is Hot Pants David Silver,

17:29.681 --> 17:32.149
who's been pressuring Donna
to do the wild thing.

17:33.018 --> 17:37.512
I consider it romancing her,
Mr. Pitts.

17:37.689 --> 17:39.316
I'm not your landlord.
I'm Howard Stern.

17:39.491 --> 17:42.824
Oh, sorry, Howard.
That's a nice wig.

17:43.695 --> 17:49.861
David, what's with you and Donna
and the old mattress mambo?

17:50.035 --> 17:56.031
Well, I just want us both to share
the intimacy of a real relationship.

17:59.912 --> 18:01.277
What a rap.

18:03.949 --> 18:06.213
Dr. Martin, Felice. You buy that?

18:06.385 --> 18:09.877
Well, as a doctor, I'm familiar with
the hormonal drives of young adults.

18:10.055 --> 18:13.650
But I leave all the parenting
to Felice.

18:13.826 --> 18:15.487
And I don't buy it.

18:15.661 --> 18:16.889
Call me old-fashioned,

18:17.062 --> 18:21.829
but I don't believe in the motives
of young men who wear earrings.

18:22.935 --> 18:25.631
What earring? Look at this,
the guy is willing to sacrifice

18:25.804 --> 18:27.829
for a shot at your daughter.

18:28.006 --> 18:33.069
Dr. Martin, Mrs. Martin,
I love Donna.

18:33.245 --> 18:36.146
Not just for her body,
but for her mind.

18:37.916 --> 18:42.615
And if she has sex with me,
I promise I'll marry her.

18:44.790 --> 18:46.417
I think we've exposed
some raw honesty.

18:46.592 --> 18:48.583
I'll tell you what,
I'll spring for the condoms.

18:48.760 --> 18:49.818
What do you say, Felice?

18:49.995 --> 18:53.021
Well, I guess in that case,
it's all right.

18:57.035 --> 19:00.004
Donna, if you're listening,
sweetheart,

19:00.172 --> 19:03.437
we give you our blessing
to do the wild thing with David.

19:28.534 --> 19:30.695
I just had a great idea.

19:30.869 --> 19:32.769
What a coincidence. So did I.

19:32.938 --> 19:35.031
- Yeah, that is, if you're up to it.
- Try me.

19:35.207 --> 19:37.767
Okay, we get out of this bed,
we go cook some breakfast,

19:37.943 --> 19:39.911
pack up the car,

19:40.479 --> 19:41.673
drive to Joshua Tree.

19:41.847 --> 19:43.075
Joshua Tree?

19:44.750 --> 19:46.445
Lt'll be great.

19:46.618 --> 19:48.483
It's in the desert,
no one will be there.

19:48.654 --> 19:50.451
Winds will be really strong.

19:50.622 --> 19:54.058
We'll build a fire, stay all night.

19:54.226 --> 19:56.217
Oh, I'd really love to, but I can't.

19:56.395 --> 19:57.885
Why not?

20:01.033 --> 20:02.796
Sorority is having a car wash.

20:03.468 --> 20:05.231
I don't think I can get out of it.

20:05.404 --> 20:08.339
- Yeah.
- Dylan, it's for a good cause.

20:08.507 --> 20:11.965
I'm sure it is, Kel.
I just don't wanna hear about it.

20:12.144 --> 20:15.910
Okay, so I guess that leaves us
where we left off.

20:16.081 --> 20:19.244
No, I can do something else
and hook up with you later.

20:19.751 --> 20:20.809
You can?

20:22.654 --> 20:24.485
And that's okay with you?
You're not mad?

20:24.656 --> 20:27.181
Let's not overanalyze, okay?

20:37.569 --> 20:39.400
Hey, D'Shawn.

20:39.571 --> 20:40.629
Yo, Brandon.

20:40.806 --> 20:42.103
What's this? You going formal?

20:42.274 --> 20:45.107
Now that I'm on the team,
I gotta look sharp for the road games.

20:45.277 --> 20:48.678
- What do you think?
- I think we should probably talk.

20:50.449 --> 20:53.213
Look, I want you to know
I didn't say a word to Randall

20:53.385 --> 20:55.250
about you and his wife.

20:55.420 --> 20:57.820
I shouldn't have threatened you,
it was just, I was feeling...

20:57.990 --> 20:59.981
Scared to take your midterm?

21:01.426 --> 21:03.917
You always cut in too deep.

21:04.096 --> 21:05.688
I guess that's why
I value our friendship.

21:05.864 --> 21:06.888
Friendship?

21:08.066 --> 21:09.727
D'Shawn, we don't have a friendship.

21:09.901 --> 21:11.869
All you ever tried to do was use me.

21:12.037 --> 21:15.165
Man, don't be like that.
I really appreciate your help.

21:15.340 --> 21:17.069
Yeah, but you didn't need
my help, did you?

21:17.676 --> 21:20.236
You got a B-plus.
Randall just hand you that grade?

21:20.412 --> 21:22.380
Yeah, and I'm cool with that.

21:23.482 --> 21:26.280
You don't live in my world.
We're different, understand?

21:26.451 --> 21:29.477
Oh, no. Don't get all racial
on me now.

21:29.955 --> 21:32.981
Coz, this ain't a black thing
or a white thing.

21:33.158 --> 21:35.422
It's a green thing.
You know what I'm saying?

21:35.594 --> 21:37.494
- Yeah, it's all about money.
- That's right.

21:37.663 --> 21:40.257
I get a chance to showcase
my talent for the pros,

21:40.432 --> 21:42.525
CU gets a shooting guard.

21:42.701 --> 21:45.568
- It's a fair trade.
- No, it's not.

21:45.737 --> 21:48.001
Because you didn't get
to take Soc 101.

21:48.173 --> 21:50.641
And you know what?
You'd have liked it.

21:51.877 --> 21:53.936
I gotta hit the gym.

21:54.112 --> 21:56.046
If you wanna sign back on
as my tutor,

21:56.214 --> 21:59.377
I heard Randall's gonna be
in his office late this afternoon.

22:00.919 --> 22:02.819
- Enough said.
- Thanks for the tip.

22:19.471 --> 22:20.836
And where is Ms. Donna Martin?

22:21.006 --> 22:23.201
I can't believe
that she'd let her sisters down.

22:23.375 --> 22:26.003
She is at the radio station
doing public-service spots.

22:26.178 --> 22:27.509
She'll be here later.

22:27.679 --> 22:29.943
Well, then,
I guess I'll save the RV for her.

22:30.115 --> 22:32.879
- Good idea.
- Hey, girls, no horsing around!

22:33.051 --> 22:34.450
There's work to be done.

22:34.619 --> 22:37.144
When you're done there,
my back could use a good scrubbing.

22:38.590 --> 22:42.458
Dylan, what are you doing here?
I thought you were going surfing.

22:42.627 --> 22:44.822
Well, the desert winds
kind of canceled out the waves.

22:44.996 --> 22:46.463
Nothing better to do, huh?

22:46.631 --> 22:48.963
Actually, I thought I'd come down,
get the grime knocked off

22:49.134 --> 22:50.158
the old speedster.

22:50.335 --> 22:51.666
- I'd love to.
- Yeah?

22:58.810 --> 23:00.835
Sorry, cowboy,
must have made a mistake.

23:01.012 --> 23:03.003
You asked for it, Sears.

23:03.181 --> 23:04.978
Water fight!

23:06.752 --> 23:09.312
No prisoners!

23:20.499 --> 23:22.524
No prisoners!

23:26.204 --> 23:28.729
They do this every year.

23:29.975 --> 23:31.738
KEG fight!

23:34.446 --> 23:36.914
- Sanders, come here, man.
- Hi there.

23:37.082 --> 23:39.573
There's nothing I want more
than to have you in this fraternity.

23:39.751 --> 23:41.378
But you gotta work with me, okay?

23:41.553 --> 23:45.114
Probation means no contact.

23:45.290 --> 23:47.520
Oh, gosh, I was just coming
for a car wash.

23:47.692 --> 23:50.024
- Get out of here.
- Let him stay, what's the big deal?

23:50.195 --> 23:52.390
Are you crazy? There could be
faculty advisers coming.

23:52.564 --> 23:55.032
- We're gonna get in trouble.
- He's right. Get out of here.

23:55.200 --> 23:56.428
Let's go.

23:56.601 --> 23:57.898
Hey, what are they doing to him?

24:03.542 --> 24:06.272
Hey, Steve, where you going?

24:06.445 --> 24:10.040
Hey, don't leave me here, man.
Where you going?

24:19.357 --> 24:22.383
Public-service announcement
number four, take one.

24:22.561 --> 24:24.791
If you're going to drink, don't drive.

24:24.963 --> 24:27.022
And if you're gonna drive,
don't drink.

24:27.199 --> 24:29.963
And if you have to choose
between one or the other...

24:30.135 --> 24:31.693
Drink gasoline.

24:31.870 --> 24:35.636
- David.
- I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.

24:35.807 --> 24:38.901
No, it was funny.

24:40.045 --> 24:41.603
You're funny.

24:42.380 --> 24:46.339
And I think that you're very sexy.

24:49.287 --> 24:50.481
What's gotten into you?

24:50.655 --> 24:54.022
Oh, I don't know,
just feeling very grateful.

24:54.693 --> 24:56.354
I mean, no matter
what I put you through,

24:56.528 --> 24:58.462
you always stay with me.

24:59.598 --> 25:00.860
You must love me.

25:02.701 --> 25:04.362
Believe me,
after what happened last night,

25:04.536 --> 25:07.198
and the fact that I'm still here today,
proves it.

25:07.672 --> 25:09.799
Well, I won't argue with that.

25:09.975 --> 25:12.068
Either that, or I'm totally nuts.

25:12.244 --> 25:13.541
I said I was sorry.

25:14.212 --> 25:16.305
I'm sorry, I didn't mean for it
to come out like that.

25:16.481 --> 25:19.678
Last night
was almost the perfect anniversary.

25:20.352 --> 25:25.085
Well, then,
maybe we've waited long enough.

25:26.992 --> 25:28.482
What?

25:28.894 --> 25:31.920
I've been thinking.
It's been hard not to.

25:32.097 --> 25:38.832
And lately, all of the signs
seem to be pointing in one direction.

25:39.738 --> 25:41.433
And what direction is that?

25:42.307 --> 25:46.038
David, I love you.

25:46.211 --> 25:51.808
And nothing we could ever do
could ever be wrong.

25:54.819 --> 25:56.343
- You mean...?
- That's right.

25:56.521 --> 26:00.821
Tonight, I'm not gonna take
my antihistamine.

26:23.515 --> 26:26.177
One white rose.

26:26.618 --> 26:28.176
Thank you.

26:30.221 --> 26:33.418
Reminds me of the first poem
I ever learned by heart.

26:33.592 --> 26:36.425
"La Rosa Blanca"
by the great poet, Jose Marti.

26:37.028 --> 26:38.052
Do you know it?

26:38.229 --> 26:41.528
Why do I suddenly feel
so culturally deprived?

27:01.720 --> 27:04.086
If you'd like,
I'll teach it to you sometime.

27:04.956 --> 27:06.583
I'd like that.

27:12.797 --> 27:14.287
So you've had enough sightseeing?

27:14.466 --> 27:16.832
No, I like seeing
your old neighborhood.

27:17.002 --> 27:18.560
Yeah.

27:19.237 --> 27:21.330
Yeah, I don't ever wanna forget
where I came from.

27:21.506 --> 27:23.303
Good for you.

27:29.247 --> 27:30.839
We're right on time.

27:31.016 --> 27:34.042
Okay. Now, you've treated me
to the best latkes in L.A.,

27:34.219 --> 27:35.914
now get ready for the best burrito.

27:36.454 --> 27:38.046
Come on,
I want you to meet my family.

27:38.223 --> 27:40.054
- Your family?
- Yeah.

27:43.561 --> 27:45.859
- Hey, Ma.
- Oh, Jesse.

27:46.031 --> 27:47.828
How you doing?

27:47.999 --> 27:50.433
This is a very good friend of mine,
Andrea Zuckerman.

27:50.602 --> 27:52.763
Hello. Very nice to meet you.

27:52.937 --> 27:56.031
Very nice to meet you.
You have a wonderful son.

27:56.207 --> 27:57.231
Thank you.

27:58.743 --> 28:00.335
It's my uncle Lolo
and my cousin Humberto.

28:00.512 --> 28:02.275
Hello.

28:02.947 --> 28:04.471
<i>Now, I recommend
the machacas burritos.</i>

28:04.649 --> 28:06.173
You want that gringo? I mean, mild.

28:06.351 --> 28:09.343
No way,
I'll have it just the way you do.

28:19.531 --> 28:22.193
There is only one thing that could
make this afternoon any better.

28:23.601 --> 28:26.365
It's if you'd come back
to my apartment in Westwood.

28:29.441 --> 28:32.535
Well, I'm always up
for a little more sightseeing.

28:39.084 --> 28:41.985
Just when I thought
it was gonna be a dull day.

28:42.153 --> 28:43.620
Lucinda, hi.

28:43.788 --> 28:45.983
I was actually looking
for your husband.

28:46.157 --> 28:47.556
Just missed him.

28:49.494 --> 28:51.792
Come in. You at least owe me
a little thanks.

28:51.963 --> 28:53.430
I do?

28:53.598 --> 28:55.395
And what for?
Did you get to D'Shawn?

28:55.567 --> 28:58.593
Well, actually, I did tell him
there was nothing between us.

28:58.770 --> 29:00.965
And since Corey
knows nothing about us,

29:01.139 --> 29:04.370
well, you can go on living
your square little existence.

29:04.542 --> 29:06.066
Oh, goody.

29:07.879 --> 29:11.007
But I'm serious about expecting
a wee bit of gratitude.

29:11.182 --> 29:12.206
What do you expect?

29:12.383 --> 29:15.216
You want me to throw you
over the desk for a quickie?

29:15.386 --> 29:18.048
I came here for something else.
You've got nothing to do with it.

29:18.590 --> 29:21.957
Oh, well, then you're lucky
Corey isn't around.

29:22.127 --> 29:25.358
You wouldn't wanna tangle with him.
He's in a pretty bad mood these days.

29:25.530 --> 29:28.590
Wouldn't have anything to do with
his office getting broken into, would it?

29:28.767 --> 29:32.203
No, we had a nasty little fight.

29:32.971 --> 29:35.235
Break-in was comic relief.

29:36.141 --> 29:38.041
My husband's precious
autographed balls

29:38.209 --> 29:39.733
were never in jeopardy.

29:39.911 --> 29:42.846
- What are you talking about?
- Campus cops were tipped off.

29:43.014 --> 29:45.244
They knew exactly when the thief
would be here.

29:45.416 --> 29:46.542
Tipped off by who?

29:47.786 --> 29:49.879
Anonymous phone call.

29:52.724 --> 29:57.684
But maybe I could find out more
if you're nice.

29:58.196 --> 30:00.858
No, you've already told me enough.

30:01.032 --> 30:02.158
Thank you.

30:14.145 --> 30:15.737
Oh, jeez. Beat it, Walsh.

30:15.914 --> 30:18.439
Steve, come on. I've been looking
for you everywhere, man.

30:18.616 --> 30:20.083
Why? So you can tell me
I'm a dimwit?

30:20.251 --> 30:22.583
And how I'm not worthy
of being your friend, huh?

30:22.754 --> 30:25.314
I'm sorry, bro. I know
I was a little hard on you yesterday,

30:25.490 --> 30:28.288
but that's before I knew that you
getting caught in Randall's office

30:28.459 --> 30:30.222
wasn't your fault.

30:31.696 --> 30:34.790
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying you got set up.

30:36.301 --> 30:37.495
The brothers at the KEG House...

30:37.669 --> 30:40.035
Steve, the cops
got an anonymous phone call.

30:40.205 --> 30:41.968
They were waiting for you.

30:42.140 --> 30:44.108
Who in the frat house knew
what you were up to?

30:44.275 --> 30:46.106
I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.

30:46.277 --> 30:48.245
You do that,
you leave the rest up to me, okay?

30:48.413 --> 30:50.040
What are you gonna do?

30:50.648 --> 30:52.275
I'm going to bat for you with Randall.

30:53.017 --> 30:55.417
Hey, man, that's like putting
your head on the chopping block.

30:55.954 --> 30:57.854
Maybe it's time to clear the decks.

30:58.022 --> 31:00.456
It's something I should have done
a long time ago.

31:00.625 --> 31:04.652
Hey, Bran, you just might be
the only brother I got.

31:07.198 --> 31:08.222
Head butt?

31:08.399 --> 31:09.866
No.

31:32.090 --> 31:35.617
Since when did we get
so many candles?

31:35.793 --> 31:40.355
Well, I just wanna make sure
that everything is perfect.

31:42.700 --> 31:43.724
Well, you're right.

31:43.902 --> 31:49.033
This is something we're going
to remember for the rest of our lives.

31:49.207 --> 31:51.437
Sure you're ready for this?

32:08.593 --> 32:10.754
Are you expecting somebody?

32:11.262 --> 32:13.389
Maybe Kelly forgot her key?

32:14.399 --> 32:18.130
Wait right here, don't go anywhere,
okay? I'll be right back.

32:21.406 --> 32:23.135
I'll be right there.

32:28.880 --> 32:33.112
Mrs. Martin, Dr. Martin,
what are you two doing here?

32:34.519 --> 32:38.615
Well, we thought we would
surprise Donna with a little visit.

32:38.790 --> 32:41.350
Well, she's not here right now.
I was just taking a nap.

32:41.526 --> 32:43.687
A nap? It's 10:00 at night.

32:44.395 --> 32:48.161
David, are you in the habit of running
around here in your underwear?

32:48.333 --> 32:49.823
It's only when I'm here by myself.

32:50.001 --> 32:51.400
Which isn't too often,

32:51.569 --> 32:53.867
because I'm usually
at my own apartment.

32:54.038 --> 32:56.302
David, what's going on?

32:57.909 --> 33:00.400
Mom, Dad.

33:04.449 --> 33:06.679
What a surprise.

33:08.086 --> 33:10.020
I thought you said she was out.

33:10.188 --> 33:12.952
Oh, well, I just snuck in
a few minutes ago.

33:13.124 --> 33:14.682
David, what are you doing here?

33:14.859 --> 33:19.193
He said that he was taking a nap.

33:19.764 --> 33:21.595
Right, nap. I almost forgot.

33:21.766 --> 33:23.233
See, David's air conditioning is out,

33:23.401 --> 33:25.767
so we're letting him sleep
on our couch.

33:25.937 --> 33:28.531
No, we walk in here unexpectedly

33:28.706 --> 33:30.936
and find the two of you
in your underwear.

33:31.109 --> 33:32.770
I think there's a better explanation.

33:38.149 --> 33:42.643
Well, actually, it turns out
that we had an extra bedroom.

33:42.820 --> 33:46.449
So Kelly and I decided
that David could move in.

33:48.292 --> 33:50.317
Donna, are the two of you
living together?

33:51.062 --> 33:53.360
No, it's not like that.

33:53.531 --> 33:57.092
David has his own bedroom,
and nothing has changed.

33:57.268 --> 33:58.792
Nothing has changed?

33:58.970 --> 34:02.371
Right from the very beginning,
you've been lying to me, haven't you?

34:03.941 --> 34:04.965
Yes, but...

34:05.143 --> 34:09.443
Every phone call, every letter
has been a betrayal.

34:09.614 --> 34:11.809
And you're telling me
nothing has changed?

34:13.751 --> 34:15.981
Why, I can see we never
should have left her here.

34:19.290 --> 34:22.157
Why can't you just be happy for me?

34:35.339 --> 34:37.569
Oh, I hope that wasn't meant for me.

34:37.742 --> 34:42.907
No, there's something unnatural
about hot winds in December.

34:43.081 --> 34:45.811
Weather's beautiful,
but the side effects aren't worth it.

34:45.983 --> 34:48.952
Well, the paper says
they've already died down.

34:49.120 --> 34:52.146
Your sinuses will recover.
I'll see you later.

34:52.322 --> 34:53.551
Where are you going so early?

34:53.724 --> 34:55.885
Up to the campus. Gonna work out,
hang out a little bit.

34:56.060 --> 34:57.254
Try to find one of my teachers.

34:57.428 --> 34:58.793
On a Sunday?

34:58.963 --> 35:01.557
Yeah, he usually works in his office
on the weekends.

35:01.732 --> 35:04.166
You aren't in some kind of trouble,
are you?

35:04.335 --> 35:07.304
Dad, me? The good son?

35:07.472 --> 35:10.566
How could you ask me
a question like that, huh?

35:12.944 --> 35:15.174
He's in trouble.

35:21.452 --> 35:24.114
They're waiting in the living room
to take me to church.

35:24.288 --> 35:25.380
I can't really talk.

35:25.556 --> 35:26.818
What happened after I left?

35:26.991 --> 35:28.356
It didn't get any better.

35:28.759 --> 35:29.783
Yeah, for me either.

35:29.961 --> 35:32.589
When I showed up at Mel's last night,
I interrupted him and Nina.

35:33.164 --> 35:35.291
Donna, are you almost ready?

35:35.466 --> 35:38.230
Yeah, I'll be there in a second.

35:40.505 --> 35:42.268
I wish I didn't have to go
through this alone.

35:42.440 --> 35:45.273
Yeah, well, I'd be there in a flash
if I thought it would help.

35:45.443 --> 35:48.640
- I love you.
- I love you too.

35:49.147 --> 35:50.478
Bye.

36:01.692 --> 36:04.252
- Hi.
- Hi.

36:05.062 --> 36:06.791
Hi, sorry I kept you waiting.

36:06.964 --> 36:08.329
So how was the hotel?

36:08.499 --> 36:10.899
Oh, it was lovely. It was lovely.

36:11.068 --> 36:12.558
After church,
we're gonna go to brunch.

36:12.737 --> 36:15.137
And we'll all sit down
and just talk sensibly, okay?

36:16.974 --> 36:19.943
Look, I'm really sorry
about last night.

36:20.578 --> 36:22.478
Well, honey,
that's all very well and good,

36:22.647 --> 36:25.514
but I just don't understand
why you had to lie to me.

36:26.284 --> 36:27.911
Why?

36:28.486 --> 36:29.680
Because if told you the truth,

36:29.854 --> 36:32.049
you never would have let us
move into this apartment.

36:32.223 --> 36:33.247
How do you know that?

36:33.424 --> 36:35.984
- You never gave me a chance.
- She's right, you wouldn't have.

36:36.160 --> 36:40.494
We talked about this last night.
Let's not go backwards, all right?

36:40.665 --> 36:45.125
Donna lives 2,000 miles away from us.
She has her own life.

36:45.570 --> 36:48.164
And you really gotta make
your own decisions now.

36:49.874 --> 36:52.172
I know that what Daddy says is true.

36:52.810 --> 36:55.973
It's just hard for me
to realize you've grown up.

36:57.381 --> 37:00.509
Well, you need to have a little faith
in the job you've done.

37:00.685 --> 37:03.085
And know I've done nothing
to make you ashamed of me.

37:03.688 --> 37:07.385
Oh, baby, I know you haven't.

37:08.793 --> 37:12.593
I just wanna be sure
that I can trust you again.

37:13.531 --> 37:16.227
You can, Mom. You can.

37:18.035 --> 37:19.935
Sweet.

37:23.074 --> 37:24.439
Sanders, what are you doing here?

37:24.609 --> 37:26.440
Don't worry, this won't take long.

37:26.611 --> 37:28.806
Man, are you determined
to bring this fraternity down?

37:28.980 --> 37:30.413
Thought you cared
about the brotherhood.

37:30.581 --> 37:31.605
I do.

37:31.782 --> 37:33.977
There's just one thing I gotta know.

37:34.151 --> 37:37.086
Who knew I was gonna hit
Randall's office that night?

37:40.091 --> 37:43.356
All right, I've had it with you, goon boy.
Why don't you get out of here?

37:43.527 --> 37:45.961
Why don't you start answering
some questions?

37:46.130 --> 37:48.997
I'm gonna get Mike Ryan.
Nobody talk to this guy.

37:49.166 --> 37:51.225
He's gonna get us all kicked out
for hazing.

37:55.473 --> 37:56.735
Come on, Keith.

37:56.907 --> 37:58.340
Besides you and Sears,
who else knew?

37:58.509 --> 38:00.602
Nobody, just us.
What's your problem?

38:00.778 --> 38:02.268
Every other pledge
took the same risks.

38:02.446 --> 38:04.573
Only you were the only one
dumb enough to get caught.

38:06.817 --> 38:09.047
Kind of makes you wonder, don't it?

38:13.658 --> 38:14.716
This is amazing.

38:16.460 --> 38:18.087
What's that?

38:18.796 --> 38:20.627
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt you.

38:20.798 --> 38:22.595
That's okay, what?

38:23.200 --> 38:24.963
It's this article that I'm reading.

38:25.703 --> 38:28.934
They did a study
on children of divorce.

38:29.106 --> 38:32.166
In one group,
the parents had shared custody.

38:32.343 --> 38:34.607
And in the other group,
only one parent had custody.

38:35.046 --> 38:36.877
Kind of like Erin.

38:37.481 --> 38:39.608
Yeah, Erin, and me too.

38:40.918 --> 38:43.978
The thing is that the kids
that went back and forth

38:44.155 --> 38:46.316
actually learned that their parents' love
would be there

38:46.490 --> 38:47.752
even when they weren't.

38:50.194 --> 38:51.855
Guess I'm still working on that.

38:53.097 --> 38:55.292
Yeah, aren't we all?

38:58.235 --> 39:00.931
If you hadn't come to the car wash,
that would have been okay.

39:01.472 --> 39:03.303
Well...

39:03.941 --> 39:07.900
You know, last night,
when we were together,

39:08.079 --> 39:10.843
I really liked hearing
about the rest of your day too.

39:14.585 --> 39:17.850
I guess what I'm getting at is...

39:18.889 --> 39:21.255
...we don't have to spend
every waking hour together

39:21.425 --> 39:22.517
to be a couple.

39:23.461 --> 39:25.019
Eloquently put.

39:25.663 --> 39:27.528
So there is hope for us, huh?

39:28.933 --> 39:29.957
Yeah.

39:37.441 --> 39:40.376
So how was Hanukkah with Jésus?

39:42.046 --> 39:43.604
His name is Jesse.

39:44.014 --> 39:45.641
Sorry, Jesse.

39:49.286 --> 39:50.981
Are you gonna be watching me
all the time?

39:51.155 --> 39:53.123
Well, Andrea,
I'm just worried about you.

39:53.591 --> 39:55.582
What's gonna be left
when the novelty wears off?

39:55.760 --> 39:58.024
What could you two
possibly talk about?

39:58.195 --> 39:59.526
How to mix the perfect margarita?

40:00.264 --> 40:02.858
For your information,
he is a second-year law student.

40:03.033 --> 40:04.398
- Really?
- Really.

40:04.568 --> 40:06.331
Of course, affirmative action.

40:06.771 --> 40:09.638
Easy to be glib when you come
from an estate in Encino, isn't it?

40:10.241 --> 40:11.401
You really love this guy?

40:11.575 --> 40:13.202
Yeah, you're damn right.

40:13.944 --> 40:16.469
<i>Then adiós, muchacha.</i>

40:22.686 --> 40:24.517
- Mr. Randall.
- I'm not open office hours.

40:24.688 --> 40:27.122
Yeah, I know,
but this is kind of important.

40:27.291 --> 40:28.849
All right, make it fast.

40:33.197 --> 40:37.759
Listen, the guy who broke
into your office, Steve Sanders.

40:37.935 --> 40:39.766
He's a friend of mine.

40:39.937 --> 40:41.302
Not too bright a friend.

40:41.472 --> 40:45.533
Listen, it was just a prank.
It was gonna be returned on Monday.

40:46.444 --> 40:48.173
You know, if he really wanted
to tick me off,

40:48.345 --> 40:50.643
he should have taken
my Don Drysdale baseball.

40:50.815 --> 40:54.012
Because I got this autographed myself
when I was a kid.

40:54.852 --> 40:57.013
Big D was my favorite pitcher.
You know why?

40:57.521 --> 41:00.115
Because Drysdale
was an intimidator.

41:00.624 --> 41:03.149
He understood the game
within the game.

41:03.327 --> 41:05.591
See, some guy comes up there,
thinks he's gonna get a hit,

41:05.763 --> 41:09.358
Drysdale would just throw
a high hard one right at his head.

41:09.533 --> 41:12.525
Only the greatest hitters could come
up there without getting weak knees.

41:12.703 --> 41:14.933
You know, kind of the way
you're facing me right now.

41:15.573 --> 41:19.134
What's the matter? You can't handle
the game within the game?

41:20.177 --> 41:22.111
Actually, I just came here
to ask a favor.

41:22.279 --> 41:23.837
A favor?

41:24.014 --> 41:27.973
Yeah. I was hoping you could drop
the charges against Steve.

41:28.152 --> 41:31.553
Oh, well. Yeah, I could do that.

41:33.257 --> 41:34.554
- You could?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

41:34.725 --> 41:36.454
All I'd have to do would be
to call security,

41:36.627 --> 41:38.595
tell them I forgot I gave him access.

41:38.762 --> 41:40.787
- It was just a mistake.
- Oh, that would be great.

41:41.265 --> 41:43.096
Yeah, but I'm not gonna do that.

41:43.267 --> 41:46.100
Because you've been hitting
the sheets with my wife.

41:47.872 --> 41:49.203
Knockdown pitch.

41:50.674 --> 41:53.074
- D'Shawn tell you that?
- No, no one told me.

41:53.244 --> 41:54.836
I know Lucinda
when she targets somebody.

41:55.012 --> 41:56.946
I know how hard she comes on,
believe me.

41:57.414 --> 42:01.544
But the question is,
what am I gonna do about it now?

42:02.520 --> 42:05.455
Look, nothing happened. When I
found out she was your wife, I bailed.

42:05.623 --> 42:08.990
Oh, yeah, right. Wouldn't touch her
with a ten-foot pole.

42:09.159 --> 42:10.592
I wouldn't touch her with a sequoia.

42:10.761 --> 42:13.753
I don't care whether you believe me
or not. Don't take this out on Steve.

42:13.931 --> 42:16.297
Hey, I'll take it out
on whoever I want to, pal.

42:16.467 --> 42:18.196
You're finished here.

42:21.872 --> 42:24.534
Fine, Professor Randall.
You wanna play a game?

42:24.708 --> 42:26.198
I'll play a game with you.

42:26.377 --> 42:28.777
I'll go to the newspapers.
I'll go to the dean.

42:28.946 --> 42:32.143
I'll go to the NCAA.
I'll go to whoever will listen to me.

42:32.316 --> 42:34.784
And I'll tell them how you gave
D'Shawn a big fat grade

42:34.952 --> 42:37.580
just so he'd be eligible
to play on the team this season.

42:39.290 --> 42:40.655
You can't prove that.

42:41.225 --> 42:42.317
Try me.

42:46.564 --> 42:48.657
Now, are you gonna call
the security office, or am I?

43:04.315 --> 43:06.545
So when did you get back?

43:07.017 --> 43:08.951
About an hour ago.

43:10.154 --> 43:13.021
So was it a horror show
with your parents?

43:13.857 --> 43:17.725
No. Actually, it was pretty nice.

43:18.295 --> 43:22.026
And they said it would be okay
if we kept things the way they are.

43:22.433 --> 43:23.627
Meaning?

43:23.801 --> 43:27.601
Meaning that the three of us
can continue to live here.

43:28.572 --> 43:30.267
I don't know how you did it.

43:30.441 --> 43:34.707
But I say we just pick up
where we left off.

43:35.679 --> 43:38.648
No, David. I don't think so.

43:42.953 --> 43:44.716
Now what?

43:45.823 --> 43:49.350
It's just that I gave them my word
that I wouldn't.

43:50.160 --> 43:51.184
See, I knew it.

43:51.362 --> 43:54.126
Second you saw your mother,
it would be high school all over again.

43:54.565 --> 43:56.089
But, David, they trust me.

43:57.668 --> 44:01.229
And it's not like that's all we have
between us. You said so yourself.

44:03.474 --> 44:05.840
Everything's gonna be okay.

44:09.947 --> 44:11.175
You really think so?

44:12.516 --> 44:13.881
I'm sure of it.

44:15.819 --> 44:16.843
All right.

44:18.889 --> 44:21.153
David, you're the best.
