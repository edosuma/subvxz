WEBVTT

00:02.621 --> 00:04.667
We talked to your mom, and she said

00:04.699 --> 00:05.856
that there was a witness.

00:05.869 --> 00:07.839
Kyle: Patrick Molloy, he
worked at the rec center.

00:07.846 --> 00:09.885
That's where I was the afternoon
Mrs. Johnson was killed.

00:09.910 --> 00:11.461
I do want you to get better,

00:11.505 --> 00:13.069
but not for me but for yourself.

00:13.088 --> 00:14.822
Well, as long as I have you I can do that.

00:14.852 --> 00:17.399
- I do have you, right?
- Yes, you do.

00:17.519 --> 00:19.605
Brandon: Of course divorce
is gonna cost a ton, so...

00:19.640 --> 00:21.297
- How much?
- (sharp inhale) 5,000 bucks.

00:21.309 --> 00:22.834
Good thing that's not your problem, huh?

00:22.874 --> 00:23.980
Think anyone would notice

00:23.985 --> 00:25.266
if we went upstairs for a little bit?

00:25.281 --> 00:26.593
I don't really think this whole

00:26.603 --> 00:28.134
friends-with-benefits
thing is working out.

00:28.180 --> 00:29.731
If you're gonna go
around and tell everyone

00:29.751 --> 00:31.013
we're like boyfriends,

00:31.063 --> 00:33.230
- you should at least ask me out first.
- (chuckles)

00:33.350 --> 00:36.753
I have some, uh, tax issues with the IRS.

00:36.793 --> 00:39.180
- How bad is it?
- There's a lien on their house.

00:39.200 --> 00:41.327
You mean they could lose their home?

00:42.485 --> 00:43.140
I don't understand.

00:43.180 --> 00:44.957
How can there be a lien on our home?

00:45.032 --> 00:46.359
Your dad's on the title, love.

00:46.364 --> 00:47.880
That's how we got approved for the loan.

00:47.895 --> 00:50.213
And plus the $200,000 that

00:50.233 --> 00:53.486
Dana and I loaned you for
the down payment on the house.

00:56.790 --> 00:59.515
Uh, what about yours and
Dana's house, Stewart?

00:59.550 --> 01:00.418
(deep sigh)

01:00.428 --> 01:02.921
Well, the IRS doesn't go after the

01:03.116 --> 01:06.384
- debtors' primary residence.
- But they'll come after ours?

01:06.391 --> 01:08.486
Listen, I would be more
than happy to sell our home,

01:08.501 --> 01:10.788
but we're already upside
down on the mortgage.

01:10.813 --> 01:12.294
How could you let this happen, Daddy?

01:12.330 --> 01:14.262
(sighs) Well, we lost a lot of money

01:14.265 --> 01:17.204
when the stock market crashed in '08,

01:17.235 --> 01:19.897
and then that was the money
we were supposed to retire on,

01:19.922 --> 01:22.070
and then we couldn't pay the income tax.

01:24.007 --> 01:25.174
Are we gonna lose our home?

01:25.209 --> 01:27.209
No! No! Absolutely not.

01:27.816 --> 01:29.482
(tired tone) Okay, how
much do you owe, Stewart?

01:29.512 --> 01:31.325
Well, it's, uh, not all that much.

01:31.375 --> 01:34.504
Um, I'm meeting today with a tax lawyer

01:34.524 --> 01:38.538
who, uh, specializes in
negotiating with the IRS.

01:38.556 --> 01:40.715
I'll work something out.
I promise, don't worry.

01:41.030 --> 01:43.368
- Stef: Okay, well, uh...
- Hi, Grandpa.

01:43.373 --> 01:44.869
Hey, hey, hey!

01:44.909 --> 01:47.496
- How's my... (kisses) gorgeous girl?
- Where's Grams?

01:47.532 --> 01:49.168
Oh, uh... (clears throat)

01:49.199 --> 01:50.125
she had to leave early.

01:50.182 --> 01:53.078
She had to sub for a
class for a colleague,

01:53.094 --> 01:54.842
but she said to say how sorry she was

01:54.853 --> 01:56.692
and to give you all a big kiss good-bye.

01:56.812 --> 01:58.892
- Whoa.
- Hey, take it easy, Miss Thing.

01:58.908 --> 02:00.016
- Come on.
- Sorry.

02:00.037 --> 02:02.419
I've got a STEAM club
meeting this morning.

02:02.462 --> 02:04.527
- What's STEAM?
- I thought it was STEM?

02:04.565 --> 02:08.297
"Science, Technology,
Engineering, Arts"...

02:08.324 --> 02:09.404
they just added that... and...

02:09.419 --> 02:10.485
- Uh-huh.
- Mistake.

02:10.527 --> 02:12.900
I would have never agreed
to joining your club

02:12.943 --> 02:15.417
if I had known that I
had to wake up this early.

02:15.417 --> 02:17.202
You joined STEM... STEAM?

02:17.218 --> 02:18.789
Jesus is helping us build a robot.

02:19.197 --> 02:21.284
Hey, did you guys every see that...

02:21.532 --> 02:23.258
the <i> Terminator</i> movie?

02:23.378 --> 02:25.776
Any day now computers are
gonna take over the world.

02:25.814 --> 02:27.136
They already have, Grandpa.

02:27.400 --> 02:31.219
(chuckles) Well, I better
get ready for my meeting.

02:31.456 --> 02:32.441
So, uh...

02:33.064 --> 02:34.661
(in Austrian accent)
<i>hasta la vista,</i> babies.

02:34.693 --> 02:35.811
(kids chuckling)

02:35.847 --> 02:39.297
- Stewart: I'll be back.
- Jesus: Why do we have to go so early?

02:39.372 --> 02:40.625
- (sighs)
- I thought the down payment

02:40.652 --> 02:42.200
your parents gave us for the house

02:42.233 --> 02:44.250
was your early inheritance.

02:44.255 --> 02:45.535
Since when did it become a loan?

02:45.552 --> 02:47.138
Since they need it back, I guess.

02:47.159 --> 02:49.994
- Mariana: Jesus, we got to go.
- Stef: Uh, Mariana.

02:50.004 --> 02:51.403
Sweetheart, can I speak
to you for a second

02:51.424 --> 02:52.634
before you go, please?

02:53.103 --> 02:55.232
Is there any reason that Nick
would be under the impression

02:55.266 --> 02:58.416
(stutters) that... that you
want to come and see him again?

02:59.003 --> 03:00.136
No, why?

03:00.171 --> 03:02.079
Well, I just... I got
a call from his doctor,

03:02.251 --> 03:04.274
and, uh, apparently Nick asked

03:04.290 --> 03:06.613
when you were coming to visit him again.

03:07.328 --> 03:08.651
Well, I'm not.

03:08.969 --> 03:11.426
And why aren't his
doctors doing their job?

03:11.443 --> 03:13.513
I mean, I can't be Nick's
only reason for living!

03:13.534 --> 03:16.057
(hurried) Okay, no worries,
love. I'll take care of it.

03:16.971 --> 03:17.745
Stef: All right?

03:17.865 --> 03:19.288
Get to school, you guys, get to school.

03:25.363 --> 03:27.229
So you're not gonna tell
her about the hearing?

03:27.512 --> 03:29.287
Well, you see how well that went.

03:29.300 --> 03:31.240
Can you imagine how she's gonna
react if I tell her that they're

03:31.272 --> 03:33.135
trying to get Nick
released from the hospital?

04:18.182 --> 04:20.315
(music playing on radio)

04:21.629 --> 04:23.608
- Have a good day. See you.
- See you.

04:25.189 --> 04:26.932
- Oh God.
- What?

04:27.158 --> 04:28.290
What... what?

04:28.326 --> 04:30.192
- What are you doing?
- Your mom.

04:30.879 --> 04:32.320
Oh, God, she's coming over.

04:32.368 --> 04:34.025
- Hey, B.
- Hey.

04:34.348 --> 04:36.198
Oh, hi, I didn't see you there.

04:36.234 --> 04:38.581
Oh, um, I dropped my phone under the seat.

04:38.602 --> 04:40.442
I hate it when that happens.

04:40.979 --> 04:42.307
Going surfing?

04:42.641 --> 04:43.856
Oh, yeah.

04:43.894 --> 04:45.679
I haven't been in a while.

04:46.233 --> 04:49.178
Yeah, surfing's like
her, uh... her therapy.

04:49.213 --> 04:50.279
That's nice.

04:50.917 --> 04:52.928
Uh, Brandon, the bell's about to ring.

04:53.729 --> 04:59.038
Uh, so have fun, and I will see you later.

05:03.327 --> 05:04.326
(vehicle departs)

05:04.446 --> 05:05.583
So,

05:05.949 --> 05:08.197
Mom tells me that you gave Cortney money.

05:08.831 --> 05:11.375
I loaned her money, yeah,

05:11.412 --> 05:13.615
- but she's gonna pay me back.
- Well, in my experience,

05:13.637 --> 05:16.347
sometimes people can
mistake a loan for a gift

05:16.406 --> 05:17.579
and vice versa.

05:18.235 --> 05:21.779
So how are you paying
for food and parties?

05:22.468 --> 05:25.062
Well, you know, I'm still
working at the Smokehouse.

05:25.092 --> 05:26.823
Making a hundred bucks a week in tips.

05:26.861 --> 05:28.250
Look, Mama, you don't have to worry.

05:28.286 --> 05:31.153
I just hope that Cortney's
pulling her weight,

05:31.188 --> 05:33.030
not just catching waves.

05:37.801 --> 05:39.228
Do you want to do something later?

05:39.666 --> 05:41.936
Can't. I have to work
on my senior project.

05:42.404 --> 05:44.133
Oh, how's that going?

05:46.304 --> 05:49.739
You know, if you need my
help, you can just ask me.

05:50.029 --> 05:52.869
See, I'm afraid you'd
just be a distraction.

05:52.939 --> 05:54.278
(young man shouts) I'm never giving in!

05:54.312 --> 05:55.881
- (laughter)
- Watch out.

05:56.059 --> 05:58.173
- (laughing) Oh!
- (water balloon splats)

05:58.182 --> 05:59.210
- Oh!
- Ah, sucker!

05:59.250 --> 06:01.733
Grow up! What is wrong with them?

06:01.853 --> 06:04.522
- (laughing) They're seniors.
- Exactly.

06:05.167 --> 06:07.117
They're playing water ninja.

06:08.259 --> 06:09.893
It's a school tradition.

06:10.720 --> 06:12.482
How have I been here for, like,

06:12.529 --> 06:15.164
a few weeks and I know
more about this than you do?

06:15.199 --> 06:17.295
Didn't you get your email
with your target's name?

06:17.322 --> 06:18.300
Pass.

06:18.336 --> 06:20.482
Oh, so you're just too
cool for school, huh?

06:20.543 --> 06:22.977
No, I'm too cool for water balloon fights.

06:22.977 --> 06:25.107
Come on, Callie, it's fun.

06:25.921 --> 06:27.898
Not everything has to be so serious.

06:30.281 --> 06:32.368
There is no way I'm
passing this week's midterm.

06:32.488 --> 06:35.032
Maybe you should ask Noah to tutor you.

06:35.057 --> 06:36.597
What, is he like a math genius too?

06:36.657 --> 06:39.286
I wouldn't be surprised.
He's pretty smart.

06:40.785 --> 06:42.963
So what's going on with you guys?

06:43.083 --> 06:44.449
We're just hanging out.

06:44.456 --> 06:46.128
He's coming over after school.

06:46.163 --> 06:47.670
Oh, really?

06:47.717 --> 06:50.661
We're probably just friends.

06:50.697 --> 06:52.167
It didn't look like "just friends"

06:52.203 --> 06:53.729
at the dance floor of your mom's party.

06:53.742 --> 06:55.504
You know one thing Noah's not?

06:55.539 --> 06:56.633
- A dancer.
- (laughs)

06:56.653 --> 06:58.684
- His moves were a little experimental.
- Probably?

06:58.710 --> 07:01.063
It's probably because he was stoned.

07:01.112 --> 07:03.247
What? No way.

07:03.367 --> 07:04.827
Uh, yeah, way.

07:04.947 --> 07:07.806
It's always the preacher's
kids you got to watch out for.

07:11.853 --> 07:13.554
Nick's doctors no longer feel

07:13.594 --> 07:15.080
that he is a danger to himself,

07:15.120 --> 07:16.546
and since he has no criminal record

07:16.587 --> 07:18.194
or history of delinquent behavior,

07:18.241 --> 07:19.780
we're asking that he be sent

07:19.780 --> 07:21.864
to the Mission Bay
Home for Delinquent Boys

07:21.911 --> 07:24.055
where he'll continue to
receive psychiatric care

07:24.129 --> 07:25.944
and therapy in a secure environment.

07:25.971 --> 07:27.853
What about being a danger to others?

07:28.196 --> 07:31.653
- And you are?
- Your Honor, my name is Stefanie Adams Foster.

07:31.706 --> 07:34.268
I was one of the police officers on-site

07:34.275 --> 07:35.875
during the lockdown at Anchor Beach

07:35.895 --> 07:38.780
- when Nick Stratos brought a gun to school.
- Allegedly!

07:38.800 --> 07:40.796
No one ever saw my son
with a gun at school.

07:40.796 --> 07:41.959
Your son broke into our house

07:42.006 --> 07:44.224
and laid in wait for 24 hours

07:44.251 --> 07:46.161
until he was able to get my daughter alone

07:46.167 --> 07:47.498
and threatened her at gunpoint.

07:47.525 --> 07:49.595
- He never threatened to hurt your daughter!
- Mr. Stratos,

07:50.053 --> 07:53.408
I'd like to hear what Officer
Adams-Foster has to say.

07:53.444 --> 07:56.412
Stef: Thank you, Your Honor.
Um, Nick Stratos has only been

07:56.466 --> 07:58.724
under psychiatric treatment
for a couple of weeks,

07:58.772 --> 08:00.620
hardly enough time to determine

08:00.667 --> 08:02.146
that he is not a threat to himself

08:02.153 --> 08:04.357
- or anyone else for that matter.
- Are you a doctor?

08:04.792 --> 08:07.777
Your Honor, this has been very
difficult on my wife and me,

08:07.799 --> 08:09.595
but our son has been victimized

08:09.606 --> 08:11.585
by a girl who is toying
with his affections,

08:11.617 --> 08:13.634
- and Ms. Adams-Foster...
- Mrs.

08:14.545 --> 08:16.502
(uncomfortably) Right, Mrs.

08:16.622 --> 08:18.858
- Give my regards to your wife.
- I will, thank you.

08:18.978 --> 08:21.665
Mrs. Adams-Foster has no reason to feel

08:21.703 --> 08:23.640
that my son is a threat to her daughter.

08:23.645 --> 08:25.942
Then why is he still
asking to see Mariana?

08:25.963 --> 08:28.853
- What are you talking about?
- His doctors called me this morning,

08:28.896 --> 08:30.235
because Nick apparently asked

08:30.262 --> 08:31.735
when Mariana was coming to visit him.

08:31.757 --> 08:33.972
I'm happy to get Dr. Stolland
on the phone, Your Honor.

08:34.015 --> 08:34.974
Nick,

08:35.979 --> 08:37.216
is this true?

08:40.976 --> 08:42.186
Yes.

08:43.820 --> 08:46.827
I gave her a necklace
with a diamond "M" on it,

08:46.848 --> 08:48.462
and I wanted to ask her
if I could have it back

08:48.582 --> 08:50.060
to give to my mom.

08:50.619 --> 08:53.619
You know, "M" for mom.

08:53.861 --> 08:55.954
I wanted to give her something special

08:55.959 --> 08:57.648
for standing by me through this.

08:58.159 --> 09:01.994
I understand I'm not in a
relationship with Mariana any more

09:02.047 --> 09:03.983
and why she doesn't want to see me.

09:04.833 --> 09:06.479
I'm not angry about it.

09:06.812 --> 09:08.926
I'm truly sorry for everything I did.

09:10.427 --> 09:12.013
I just... (sighs)

09:12.196 --> 09:13.600
want to get better

09:13.976 --> 09:16.487
so that I can pay for my mistakes...

09:17.327 --> 09:18.988
and get on with my life.

09:27.604 --> 09:28.637
(knocks)

09:28.757 --> 09:29.900
- Eric: Hey.
- Hey.

09:29.943 --> 09:31.552
Just wanted to drop off Brandon's

09:31.568 --> 09:33.268
letter of recommendation for Juilliard.

09:33.330 --> 09:35.111
Thank you so much, Eric.

09:35.128 --> 09:37.011
I haven't seen much of him
around the music room lately.

09:37.131 --> 09:39.742
I hope he's practicing. He's
got to put 120 percent into this.

09:39.750 --> 09:41.314
He is. He's been practicing at home

09:41.340 --> 09:44.067
and he even took the SATs
again to improve on his score,

09:44.094 --> 09:45.540
which was already pretty high.

09:45.575 --> 09:48.306
Um, he's be better off
focusing on his audition.

09:49.010 --> 09:51.134
Juilliard doesn't even require SAT scores,

09:51.161 --> 09:53.124
unless the student's home-schooled.

09:53.748 --> 09:54.716
Does Brandon know that?

09:54.716 --> 09:56.163
Yeah. I'm pretty sure we talked about it.

09:56.187 --> 09:58.548
- Anyway, I'll see you.
- Okay.

10:01.859 --> 10:04.044
(drill whirs)

10:07.859 --> 10:10.439
If I knew being a nerd was this fun,

10:10.464 --> 10:13.497
I would have converted much sooner.

10:15.438 --> 10:17.238
It doesn't fit.

10:17.531 --> 10:20.858
This is three millimeters
from the edge you measured?

10:20.892 --> 10:22.379
Uh, yeah, three millimeters

10:22.421 --> 10:24.579
from the edge of the rod
to the edge of the hole.

10:25.388 --> 10:28.174
No, three millimeters
from the edge of the rod

10:28.185 --> 10:29.550
to the center of the hole.

10:29.586 --> 10:31.519
That's useless. Do it again.

10:31.857 --> 10:33.664
Right, this is very complex work

10:33.672 --> 10:35.605
and any little error can cost us big time,

10:35.625 --> 10:37.260
so if you don't understand something,

10:37.286 --> 10:39.437
you need to ask for clarification.

10:41.251 --> 10:43.598
- Got it.
- Hey, Mariana.

10:43.633 --> 10:46.570
I think we should get the omni wheels.

10:46.603 --> 10:48.209
They can move in any direction

10:48.243 --> 10:51.065
- and they're cool as hell.
- Yeah, no, you've seen the field.

10:51.078 --> 10:53.323
We have to be able to make sure
we can get over the obstacles.

10:53.350 --> 10:55.521
It's not like omni
wheels can't go straight,

10:55.568 --> 10:58.721
unless... are you afraid you
won't be able to drive it?

10:58.841 --> 11:01.236
I'm happy to take over
as driver if you want.

11:01.269 --> 11:02.583
No thanks.

11:04.960 --> 11:06.203
(sighs) Okay,

11:06.445 --> 11:08.388
but make sure that we have enough control.

11:08.435 --> 11:09.928
I'll order them now.

11:13.479 --> 11:16.262
Um, why did you just back down?

11:16.289 --> 11:19.152
We have to pick our
battles. It should be fine.

11:19.152 --> 11:20.601
Just let the boys have their toys.

11:20.637 --> 11:22.124
- Should be fine?
- Seriously?

11:22.137 --> 11:24.558
I can't deal with you
second-guessing me right now, okay?

11:24.574 --> 11:25.540
(bell rings)

11:27.577 --> 11:29.343
(people chatter)

11:29.667 --> 11:30.917
(text message ping)

11:34.158 --> 11:37.385
_

11:38.783 --> 11:41.322
Hey, what was that about? Did
she say something about me?

11:41.734 --> 11:43.273
- Hello.
- What?

11:43.280 --> 11:44.625
What did Emma say?

11:44.745 --> 11:47.448
Look, I can't deal with
your drama right now.

11:49.983 --> 11:52.531
_

11:52.806 --> 11:54.164
Who are you texting?

11:54.508 --> 11:57.420
_

11:57.540 --> 11:58.615
Huh?

11:59.328 --> 12:02.252
- Mariana!
- Just mind your own business! Okay?

12:06.904 --> 12:09.417
- (scoffs)
- (fast tempo piano)

12:18.609 --> 12:20.394
- (door slams)
- (song ends)

12:22.985 --> 12:25.096
- Everything okay?
- Who's home?

12:25.513 --> 12:28.336
(stutters) Uh, I don't think anyone yet.

12:29.244 --> 12:30.918
Why? What's... what's going on?

12:31.038 --> 12:32.686
I called Coronado High.

12:33.271 --> 12:34.770
Your name's not on the list of students

12:34.776 --> 12:36.177
who took the SATs.

12:37.385 --> 12:39.833
Uh, that... that's weird. Um,

12:39.953 --> 12:42.496
maybe they forgot to log
my name in or something.

12:42.534 --> 12:45.185
And you realize that Juilliard
doesn't require SAT scores?

12:45.455 --> 12:47.272
Uh, yeah, well, you
know, I mean, it wasn't...

12:47.304 --> 12:49.048
it wasn't going to be the
only school I applied to.

12:49.386 --> 12:52.226
Did you take that test for yourself?

12:52.851 --> 12:54.428
Or for someone else?

12:56.062 --> 12:59.304
- (uncertain scoff) Why... why would I?
- For money!

13:04.271 --> 13:06.732
You realize what you've done?

13:07.827 --> 13:09.716
You've committed academic fraud!

13:09.836 --> 13:12.311
The consequence of which is no Juilliard,

13:12.352 --> 13:14.241
no college, period!

13:16.130 --> 13:18.501
- What? Do they know?
- (screaming) I know!

13:19.071 --> 13:21.673
And you have put me in a
terrible position, Brandon,

13:21.673 --> 13:23.912
because if I report
this, which I am ethically

13:23.945 --> 13:25.740
and professionally required to do,

13:25.860 --> 13:29.294
I will be responsible for
completely destroying your future!

13:30.533 --> 13:33.467
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- Sorry's not gonna cut it, Brandon!

13:33.503 --> 13:36.677
First, everything with
Callie and now this...

13:36.703 --> 13:39.164
- what is going on with you?
- Cortney's ex is...

13:39.171 --> 13:41.087
is suing for custody!

13:41.121 --> 13:44.360
So she needs a lawyer. She
needs the money for a lawyer.

13:44.401 --> 13:46.747
Brandon, when you continue
to justify your actions,

13:46.801 --> 13:49.725
it's a pretty clear sign that you have
lost your sense of right and wrong.

13:50.915 --> 13:53.087
I can't even look at you right now.

14:00.381 --> 14:02.081
- (Taps on door)
- Hey.

14:02.142 --> 14:05.768
So I looked into Kyle's
alibi witness, Patrick Molloy,

14:05.888 --> 14:08.592
and it turns out that he was arrested

14:08.617 --> 14:10.937
for lewd and lascivious acts with a minor.

14:11.575 --> 14:14.828
- When was this?
- A couple months before Kyle's trial.

14:14.948 --> 14:16.544
- So did he go to prison?
- No,

14:16.664 --> 14:17.978
the charges were dropped.

14:18.551 --> 14:21.756
Well, I did find something
odd in the arrest report

14:21.762 --> 14:24.681
that a lead detective on
Kyle's case... Detective Gray...

14:24.730 --> 14:28.737
was called in to question Patrick
Molloy after he was arrested.

14:28.753 --> 14:32.874
- So?
- Well, Gray is in the homicide unit

14:32.895 --> 14:35.224
and the molestation case belonged Vice.

14:35.256 --> 14:37.282
Those guys are very territorial.

14:37.318 --> 14:38.498
So, why would they do that?

14:38.541 --> 14:39.918
I have a theory.

14:41.241 --> 14:42.661
Jude: Oh, watch out or the wall!

14:42.923 --> 14:45.484
- (laughs)
- Sorry, I'm kinda lame at this.

14:45.543 --> 14:47.549
My mom doesn't like
me to play video games.

14:47.559 --> 14:49.227
She thinks they mess with your head.

14:50.297 --> 14:51.263
(crunching)

14:51.298 --> 14:53.556
Oh my God, get that stuff away from me.

14:54.268 --> 14:56.369
Candy is totally my kryptonite.

14:57.304 --> 14:59.071
What? You've got like the munchies?

15:00.634 --> 15:01.925
You stoned?

15:02.833 --> 15:05.184
Taylor told me you were high
at my mom's birthday party.

15:05.630 --> 15:07.079
Oh! Yeah.

15:07.389 --> 15:10.115
(stutters) I mean, no.
No, I'm not high right now,

15:10.539 --> 15:13.043
but yeah, I... I have
a medical marijuana card.

15:13.078 --> 15:15.252
- How? You're fifteen.
- My mom got it for me.

15:15.372 --> 15:17.497
The same mom who's afraid video
games will mess with your head?

15:17.551 --> 15:19.722
(laughs) It's for my anxiety.

15:20.603 --> 15:23.003
I get nervous around large
crowds, and new people.

15:23.238 --> 15:25.476
I guess she'd rather me
have something natural

15:25.477 --> 15:27.561
rather than a prescription
drug or something.

15:27.756 --> 15:29.226
Have you ever tried it?

15:29.941 --> 15:31.228
Uh, no.

15:32.220 --> 15:33.830
Do you want to?

15:34.317 --> 15:36.740
- Wh... do you mean right now?
- (chuckling) No. No, I don't...

15:36.761 --> 15:38.327
I don't have any on me right now.

15:38.656 --> 15:40.119
My mom limits how much I get,

15:40.142 --> 15:42.333
but I, uh... I save some for...

15:43.100 --> 15:44.207
fun.

15:45.238 --> 15:47.110
If you want, I can bring it over tomorrow.

15:48.471 --> 15:50.333
Yeah, sure, cool.

15:54.576 --> 15:56.553
So this Detective Gray would

15:56.566 --> 15:58.804
put a child molester back on the streets

15:58.845 --> 16:00.566
just to make sure that Kyle was convicted

16:00.593 --> 16:02.771
- of Mrs. Johnson's murder?
- Yeah, it's horrible,

16:02.785 --> 16:05.514
but my mom said that detectives
are under so much pressure

16:05.541 --> 16:06.845
to close their cases,

16:06.879 --> 16:08.775
and some of them are just
willing to do whatever it takes.

16:08.789 --> 16:11.784
And Molloy will never
admit that he made a deal,

16:11.800 --> 16:13.474
because if he did, he
could still be charged.

16:13.535 --> 16:15.238
Yeah, and possibly go to jail.

16:15.274 --> 16:17.360
So we're back to where we started with

16:17.373 --> 16:18.724
no alibi witness for Kyle.

16:18.765 --> 16:21.548
Which is why I went to
Sheila's this afternoon

16:21.668 --> 16:23.518
to pick up all of Kyle's case files.

16:24.633 --> 16:27.134
My mom told me I'm not supposed to be like

16:27.181 --> 16:29.103
detectiving or anything, but

16:29.157 --> 16:30.878
she never said we couldn't do this.

16:37.661 --> 16:39.839
I've never seen my mom so mad.

16:41.984 --> 16:44.001
God, this is all my fault.

16:45.339 --> 16:46.937
No, it's not.

16:48.073 --> 16:50.273
It was my choice to take that test.

16:52.754 --> 16:54.623
I just wish I hadn't.

17:02.340 --> 17:04.579
- What's this?
- It's 900 bucks.

17:05.089 --> 17:07.309
I know it's just a dent in what I owe you,

17:07.348 --> 17:10.108
- but I'm paying every penny back.
- Where did you get this?

17:10.583 --> 17:13.218
I sold my surfboarding gear.

17:14.260 --> 17:16.189
Cort, you love surfing.

17:16.882 --> 17:19.970
You can't be the only one
making sacrifices, Brandon.

17:27.012 --> 17:27.978
Hey.

17:28.815 --> 17:32.538
We're gonna get through all of this, okay?

17:32.881 --> 17:33.950
Together.

17:50.233 --> 17:53.574
I, uh, spoke to your mother today.

17:53.872 --> 17:56.209
- She called you?
- No, I called her.

17:56.841 --> 17:58.918
Um... (sighs)

17:59.295 --> 18:02.454
your dad has not exactly been
telling us the truth, Lena.

18:02.474 --> 18:04.437
(sighs) According to my mother,

18:04.477 --> 18:07.147
who just abandoned him here
as soon as things got rough.

18:07.152 --> 18:08.545
She didn't abandon him. She went home,

18:08.572 --> 18:10.320
and it's a good thing she
did because she was able to go

18:10.322 --> 18:11.955
through their financial records.

18:12.580 --> 18:14.314
Well, I'm sure she's making it seem

18:14.321 --> 18:16.026
a lot worse than it really is.

18:16.061 --> 18:18.862
He owes the IRS almost $300,000, Lena.

18:21.393 --> 18:22.999
How is that even possible?

18:23.035 --> 18:24.532
Well, he lost money in the stock market,

18:24.566 --> 18:27.013
but then he tried to
recoup it, making a lot of

18:27.026 --> 18:28.653
bad, high-risk investments.

18:28.673 --> 18:30.058
And they're upside down on the house

18:30.065 --> 18:32.572
because he took out a
second and third mortgage.

18:33.346 --> 18:36.337
He hasn't paid his income
taxes in four years.

18:36.358 --> 18:37.709
(Stef stutters) I mean... (sighs)

18:37.736 --> 18:40.132
it's as if he's... he kept doubling down

18:40.169 --> 18:42.166
- on these get-rich-quick schemes...
- Okay!

18:43.087 --> 18:44.277
Enough!

18:48.520 --> 18:50.631
My father's made some mistakes,

18:51.189 --> 18:53.501
but I don't appreciate
you calling my mother

18:53.621 --> 18:56.255
and ganging up on him.
He needs our support.

18:56.375 --> 19:00.003
He has to go home and face his wife

19:00.038 --> 19:02.381
and their financial situation.

19:02.961 --> 19:06.810
And we need to figure
out how to save our house.

19:07.684 --> 19:09.846
Well, I'm not gonna
tell him he has to leave.

19:10.893 --> 19:12.632
You and my mother can
doubt him all you want,

19:12.632 --> 19:14.582
but he's always come through for us.

19:17.284 --> 19:19.711
So if he says he's gonna
fix this, I believe him.

19:26.231 --> 19:27.596
What's that?

19:27.650 --> 19:29.270
This is the forensics report.

19:29.283 --> 19:31.199
Oh, no, I mean...

19:31.724 --> 19:33.036
that.

19:33.633 --> 19:37.881
Oh, that is the school
project that won't die.

19:38.001 --> 19:41.706
Um, I had this idea to do
it on all the foster homes

19:41.733 --> 19:43.535
that my little brother and I were in,

19:43.655 --> 19:45.916
but right now it just seems lame.

19:46.304 --> 19:47.555
Why?

19:48.079 --> 19:50.265
I don't know. It's just not important.

19:50.668 --> 19:54.958
Okay, so this forensics
report is really disturbing.

19:55.334 --> 19:58.294
Um, "Mrs. Johnson was
found in her living room,

19:58.297 --> 19:59.896
face down in a pool of blood.

19:59.932 --> 20:01.862
She was bludgeoned in the back of the head

20:01.882 --> 20:02.971
with a garden axe."

20:02.985 --> 20:04.908
There's no sign of forced entry,

20:04.942 --> 20:07.557
and Kyle's DNA all over the murder weapon.

20:07.584 --> 20:10.012
Okay, but Kyle did yard
work for her, right?

20:10.032 --> 20:12.627
So wouldn't his DNA be all
over the gardening tools anyway?

20:12.633 --> 20:13.790
Yeah.

20:13.850 --> 20:15.045
Wait.

20:15.080 --> 20:16.445
It's missing a page.

20:16.486 --> 20:19.544
Look it goes right from page six of eight

20:19.598 --> 20:21.843
to eight of eight. Where is page seven?

20:21.890 --> 20:24.256
That is a good question.

20:25.440 --> 20:26.990
What's going on?

20:27.927 --> 20:29.926
This is Aaron.

20:29.962 --> 20:32.392
He's helping me look
through Kyle's case files.

20:33.071 --> 20:35.356
You're supposed to be working
on your senior project.

20:35.612 --> 20:37.279
Yeah, actually, um,

20:37.306 --> 20:39.451
I was thinking of maybe changing it

20:39.465 --> 20:41.562
to be about Kyle's case,

20:41.582 --> 20:43.856
hm, um, like juvenile justice.

20:43.888 --> 20:46.843
No, Callie, you're not
changing your project again!

20:47.982 --> 20:51.714
- Why not?
- Because you've already changed it three times!

20:51.834 --> 20:54.913
There's a reason you wanted to
do seven homes in seven years,

20:54.967 --> 20:57.011
one that made a lot
of sense to Mom and me.

20:57.751 --> 20:59.424
Aaron, I'm sorry,

20:59.445 --> 21:00.742
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

21:00.789 --> 21:02.275
Callie has to focus on her school work.

21:02.395 --> 21:04.521
- Can I take that?
- Yeah.

21:05.744 --> 21:08.031
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, you too.

21:11.169 --> 21:12.588
Well, that was rude.

21:13.099 --> 21:14.685
I am sorry you feel that way,

21:15.068 --> 21:17.253
but we think that it's time
you commit to this project,

21:17.307 --> 21:18.924
and that you commit to the family,

21:18.954 --> 21:20.010
as a matter of fact.

21:20.045 --> 21:22.396
So how about you stop making excuses

21:22.423 --> 21:23.880
and get it done!

21:38.671 --> 21:40.889
- Cool, right?
- Uh.

21:40.916 --> 21:43.477
Craig: Yeah, it's cool, but, uh,

21:43.793 --> 21:46.032
why are we doing swerve drive?

21:50.092 --> 21:51.692
Sorry, my bad.

21:51.705 --> 21:53.358
Craig: You've seen the
field. There's no way

21:53.378 --> 21:55.624
those omni wheels are gonna be
able to get over those obstacles.

21:55.650 --> 21:57.074
We talked about this.

21:57.117 --> 21:58.602
Simple is better.

21:59.618 --> 22:01.323
Yeah, no, you're right.

22:01.640 --> 22:03.386
- We'll swap them out.
- We can't afford

22:03.387 --> 22:04.484
to make mistakes like this, Mariana.

22:04.484 --> 22:07.558
If we do, we're never
gonna be ready in time.

22:11.725 --> 22:14.495
Okay, so I'll take care of
getting the new wheels, but

22:14.904 --> 22:16.442
we have to make up for some lost time,

22:16.453 --> 22:17.942
so you should probably start coding

22:17.996 --> 22:19.314
- for basic drive...
- (text message ping)

22:19.362 --> 22:21.277
and then we'll upload it
whenever the new wheels get in.

22:21.336 --> 22:22.110
Aiden: Okay.

22:22.143 --> 22:23.982
Oh, and thanks for hanging
me out to dry with Craig.

22:24.014 --> 22:25.897
Hey, you're the team leader.

22:25.956 --> 22:26.994
You're right.

22:27.300 --> 22:28.419
I am.

22:42.961 --> 22:44.559
Hey, can you give me a ride?

22:45.139 --> 22:46.699
What's up? Everything good?

22:46.819 --> 22:48.689
Yeah, yeah, I'm... I'm fine.

22:49.001 --> 22:50.356
Uh, we miss you.

22:50.717 --> 22:52.126
Miss you too.

22:52.642 --> 22:55.014
Hey, what's up with that... that new guy?

22:55.025 --> 22:58.090
- Is he, uh...
- No. I'm not sure yet.

22:58.144 --> 22:59.268
Gotcha.

22:59.322 --> 23:00.668
You ever done pot?

23:01.145 --> 23:02.640
Uh...

23:02.656 --> 23:04.625
well, I mean, are you wearing like a wire

23:04.641 --> 23:06.163
- or something?
- (laughs) No.

23:06.222 --> 23:07.287
Um,

23:08.088 --> 23:10.090
I did it once. Yeah.

23:10.527 --> 23:13.567
But... why? Are you thinking of trying it?

23:13.607 --> 23:15.294
No, no! I... I, um...

23:15.414 --> 23:17.405
You know, I just heard some
other kids talking about it

23:17.439 --> 23:19.053
and I was wondering what it was like.

23:19.088 --> 23:20.951
I didn't like it. Um...

23:21.071 --> 23:22.988
I... I kind of just got paranoid,

23:23.026 --> 23:26.894
and my head kept jumping
from one thought to the next.

23:27.371 --> 23:30.619
It was like an acid trip
or something like that.

23:30.739 --> 23:32.958
That was a bad example.

23:32.971 --> 23:34.800
Actually, I've never done acid.

23:34.837 --> 23:37.145
Um, don't do acid. (chuckles)

23:37.187 --> 23:39.296
I don't know, I... I kind of

23:39.683 --> 23:44.679
panicked and had to call
Mama to come pick me up.

23:45.003 --> 23:46.293
You did? Was she mad?

23:46.314 --> 23:49.688
No, actually, she was... really cool,

23:49.808 --> 23:51.006
but...

23:52.035 --> 23:53.749
I felt pretty stupid.

23:55.605 --> 23:57.892
Uh, you know what? I'm
gonna catch you later. Okay?

23:59.027 --> 24:00.594
Hey, man.

24:00.647 --> 24:02.863
- What's up, bro?
- Uh, we got to talk.

24:04.834 --> 24:06.834
(jazz music playing on radio)

24:13.912 --> 24:15.203
So...

24:15.861 --> 24:18.464
when you asked for a ride home,

24:18.464 --> 24:20.353
I sort of thought maybe you wanted...

24:20.554 --> 24:21.816
No.

24:22.316 --> 24:24.652
No, sorry, just a ride.

24:26.692 --> 24:28.656
You know what I don't get?

24:30.382 --> 24:33.448
What teenage boy gives up
no-strings-attached sex?

24:33.568 --> 24:35.088
What does it matter? Can't you get your

24:35.095 --> 24:38.636
-  benefits from some other friend?
- Yeah, I can.

24:38.840 --> 24:40.475
I can get all the benefits I want,

24:40.475 --> 24:42.331
any time I want from any friend too.

24:42.379 --> 24:44.207
Good, then what do you need me for?

24:44.847 --> 24:47.681
I mean, you don't think I'm
good enough for you anyway.

24:47.751 --> 24:49.644
- Why would you say that?
- I think you know.

24:49.698 --> 24:51.253
Actually, I'm pretty sure I don't!

24:51.274 --> 24:53.802
You think I'm dumb, Emma.

24:54.856 --> 24:56.141
Why do you...

24:57.029 --> 24:58.801
I don't think you're dumb.

24:58.819 --> 25:00.519
(scoffing laugh) Come on!

25:00.639 --> 25:03.386
We both know that I'm
not smart enough for you,

25:03.420 --> 25:04.616
and that's why you won't date me.

25:04.643 --> 25:07.171
The reason I won't date you is because...

25:08.563 --> 25:10.598
you broke my heart.

25:11.801 --> 25:15.226
No, you broke up with me.

25:15.232 --> 25:17.216
Because I didn't think you were...

25:18.332 --> 25:19.589
into me.

25:19.636 --> 25:21.189
You know that's not true.

25:21.236 --> 25:23.596
Then why did you immediately
start hooking up with Hayley

25:23.623 --> 25:25.484
like two seconds after
it was over with us?

25:25.511 --> 25:27.790
Hayley was a mistake. I only got with her,

25:27.797 --> 25:29.984
because I thought that you didn't want me.

25:30.104 --> 25:31.736
Well, that sucks

25:31.856 --> 25:33.954
- big time.
- Well, I'm sorry!

25:33.990 --> 25:34.989
(radio plays)

25:39.360 --> 25:40.362
So...

25:41.034 --> 25:42.830
do you think maybe I...

25:43.616 --> 25:45.800
that I could unbreak your heart?

25:48.908 --> 25:51.099
Is that Mariana?

25:53.506 --> 25:55.233
Is that what we're doing here?

25:55.353 --> 25:57.660
- Following her?
- Jesus: Oh my God!

26:02.171 --> 26:04.585
Jesus: What the hell is she doing?

26:10.621 --> 26:12.738
I was thinking about you today.

26:12.929 --> 26:14.547
I saw this Vine of this guy

26:14.561 --> 26:18.201
- who ate like 1,000 pounds of candy.
- Oh, yeah, funny.

26:18.234 --> 26:21.166
So I made a playlist of some
music I like to chill with.

26:21.636 --> 26:22.870
Yeah, so...

26:23.519 --> 26:24.628
Listen, I...

26:25.455 --> 26:27.775
I don't think I'm really
ready to smoke pot.

26:28.541 --> 26:30.943
Uh, uh, okay. Um...

26:32.039 --> 26:34.308
The thing is we're not smoking it.

26:35.689 --> 26:37.268
We're eating it.

26:43.983 --> 26:45.316
Hey, Mama.

26:45.590 --> 26:47.849
Hey, um...

26:48.024 --> 26:49.799
So I just wanted to let you know

26:49.839 --> 26:52.575
that I'm... I'm making
this whole SAT-thing right.

26:52.695 --> 26:54.928
I gave the money back to the kid

26:54.955 --> 26:58.156
that I took the test for and
I'm making him take it himself,

26:58.215 --> 27:00.447
and to use whatever score he gets.

27:00.490 --> 27:02.266
That way, you know, you don't have to

27:02.630 --> 27:05.088
compromise your integrity or anything.

27:05.686 --> 27:06.815
Okay.

27:08.041 --> 27:09.838
Uh, I mean...

27:10.176 --> 27:12.807
I... I thought you'd be happy

27:12.834 --> 27:14.609
that I'm fixing this.

27:14.614 --> 27:17.505
Like you fixed things buying
back those fake ID's you made?

27:17.552 --> 27:19.852
It's the fact that you did
these things at all, Brandon,

27:19.885 --> 27:21.210
that concerns me.

27:22.682 --> 27:25.451
A character is much
easier kept than recovered.

27:25.571 --> 27:28.092
I hope you remember that next time.

27:30.627 --> 27:32.079
(car door closes)

27:33.410 --> 27:36.153
(vibrating) The universe is collapsing

27:36.273 --> 27:38.614
on itself. (Laughs)

27:38.654 --> 27:40.073
Stephen Hawking?

27:40.193 --> 27:41.874
The smartest man in the world?

27:41.994 --> 27:43.307
No?

27:44.677 --> 27:46.911
(both laughing)

27:48.590 --> 27:50.963
- Dude!
- Did you just call me Jude?

27:50.963 --> 27:52.883
- No, that's my name.
- Yeah,

27:52.919 --> 27:54.446
that's why I thought it was weird.

27:54.566 --> 27:57.254
No, but I just wanted to tell you

27:57.290 --> 28:00.106
that I can feel my bones,

28:00.126 --> 28:02.708
like, inside my skin.

28:03.690 --> 28:05.196
(both laughing)

28:05.888 --> 28:07.918
Hey, doors open please.

28:07.958 --> 28:09.592
(voice echoes) Dinner's almost ready.

28:09.626 --> 28:11.803
Noah, you are welcome
to join us if you'd like.

28:11.810 --> 28:14.378
Oh, thank you, but I got to get home.

28:14.405 --> 28:15.676
Okay.

28:15.912 --> 28:17.559
What is this?

28:19.434 --> 28:21.821
Don't ruin your appetite
before dinner, please.

28:24.820 --> 28:28.139
- Do you think she knew?
- No, we're cool.

28:29.500 --> 28:32.107
But, man, you never told
me your mom was the po-po.

28:32.833 --> 28:34.298
Po-po?

28:34.339 --> 28:36.718
(laughing)

28:43.202 --> 28:44.423
(laughter stops)

28:52.020 --> 28:54.145
(laughing resumes)

28:58.286 --> 28:59.503
Stewart: Hey!

28:59.516 --> 29:01.392
- Hey, Daddy.
- Hey, so,

29:01.607 --> 29:04.162
I think I found a
solution to our problems.

29:04.282 --> 29:06.178
Well, great, what's the plan?

29:06.226 --> 29:08.955
Well, it's more of an opportunity, really.

29:09.075 --> 29:13.553
See, if we can just
scrape together $20,000,

29:13.673 --> 29:15.597
we could buy shares in this company

29:15.630 --> 29:18.508
that is about to announce
that it has developed

29:18.548 --> 29:23.240
an affordable technique to desalinate
sea water using solar power.

29:23.812 --> 29:25.567
Now within the next few months,

29:25.587 --> 29:27.987
they are projecting 10 to 20 times

29:28.000 --> 29:31.657
the return on their investment.
I could pay off the IRS

29:31.691 --> 29:33.943
and then even your line of
credit loan on the house,

29:33.963 --> 29:35.274
and then... (mimics whoosh)

29:35.321 --> 29:36.538
the lien goes away.

29:36.658 --> 29:40.465
- Um, Daddy, that sounds pretty risky.
- It's a no-brainer.

29:40.808 --> 29:43.659
I mean, water is the new oil.

29:43.673 --> 29:45.205
I mean, trust me on this, honey.

29:45.232 --> 29:47.881
- This is the answer to our problems.
- Dad.

29:49.649 --> 29:52.069
We know how much you owe the IRS.

29:53.791 --> 29:55.646
You've been talking to your mother.

29:57.099 --> 29:58.450
Lena: Yes,

29:58.678 --> 30:00.823
we... we called her...

30:01.213 --> 30:02.974
and we know everything.

30:03.035 --> 30:07.149
We know about the second
and third mortgages...

30:07.539 --> 30:09.354
and we know about

30:09.643 --> 30:11.760
all the get-rich-quick schemes.

30:11.800 --> 30:13.367
Yeah, well, this is different.

30:13.400 --> 30:15.518
This is different. I am right about this.

30:15.538 --> 30:17.373
We can't afford for you to be wrong again.

30:17.373 --> 30:19.490
- You are making a mistake here, honey!
- No, no,

30:19.510 --> 30:21.298
you've made mistakes, Dad!

30:23.389 --> 30:27.019
You've lost everything and
you're in denial about it.

30:27.705 --> 30:29.675
Stewart, you keep dodging the IRS,

30:29.702 --> 30:31.618
you're gonna end up in jail.

30:38.017 --> 30:40.117
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

30:42.252 --> 30:44.611
I still have my life insurance.

30:44.638 --> 30:47.313
I could probably drive off
a cliff. You'd all be okay.

30:47.918 --> 30:50.109
Daddy, don't say that.

30:50.156 --> 30:53.371
Don't ever say that. We would
never be okay without you.

30:54.091 --> 30:55.966
(crying)

30:56.200 --> 30:59.270
All I ever wanted was to
take care of my family.

31:00.158 --> 31:01.594
(whispers) I know.

31:03.196 --> 31:04.541
I know.

32:38.222 --> 32:39.523
Stef: Don't even think a bout it.

32:39.556 --> 32:40.599
Dinner's gonna be ready soon.

32:40.621 --> 32:43.124
- Come on, I'm starving.
- Then eat a veggie, here.

32:44.114 --> 32:46.184
Uh, potato chips are
technically a vegetable.

32:46.190 --> 32:47.626
You know what, young man?

32:49.788 --> 32:50.749
Stef: Hey, sweets.

32:50.785 --> 32:53.908
Um, can I talk to you about Nick?

32:56.161 --> 32:59.464
- Uh, should I go?
- No, no, no, you need to hear this too.

32:59.518 --> 33:00.868
Um... (inhales deeply)

33:01.147 --> 33:02.846
Nick has been released from the hospital,

33:02.966 --> 33:04.977
and has been moved to
a group home for boys.

33:04.999 --> 33:07.933
- Uh, is he okay, mentally?
- That remains to be seen,

33:07.968 --> 33:10.387
but according to the doctors and the judge

33:10.622 --> 33:13.264
who approved the move,
they seemed to think so.

33:13.835 --> 33:16.155
He is still under lock and key.

33:16.275 --> 33:18.246
He has no access to phones or computers,

33:18.293 --> 33:19.536
and I have made it quite clear to them

33:19.536 --> 33:21.197
that he is not to
contact either one of you,

33:21.204 --> 33:23.815
but if he does, you need to let me know.

33:25.567 --> 33:26.911
Okay.

33:27.221 --> 33:29.775
All right, and I'm gonna
be closely monitoring

33:29.788 --> 33:31.853
his detention and activities,

33:32.599 --> 33:34.992
so there's no need for
you to worry at all.

33:35.201 --> 33:36.330
I'm not worried.

33:41.735 --> 33:43.564
(sighs)

33:44.485 --> 33:47.954
It's like the most
depressing scrapbook ever.

33:48.311 --> 33:50.623
This was a horrible idea. No
one's gonna want to see this.

33:50.644 --> 33:53.605
I don't want to see this. I
hate that this is my story.

33:53.659 --> 33:56.948
I just want to pretend it never happened.

33:58.052 --> 33:59.051
But you can't.

33:59.747 --> 34:00.645
Look,

34:01.005 --> 34:03.167
it's hard to look back on the rough stuff.

34:04.748 --> 34:08.458
I mean, I'm transgender, I get it.

34:10.906 --> 34:13.518
When I see pictures
before my transition...

34:13.917 --> 34:15.127
(sighs)

34:15.176 --> 34:16.768
I see how sad I was. (chuckles)

34:17.429 --> 34:18.472
I just wanted to

34:19.091 --> 34:21.219
erase the first 16 years of my life,

34:21.947 --> 34:25.195
but you can't let go of
all that pain and sadness

34:25.212 --> 34:26.534
when you lock it in.

34:28.309 --> 34:30.466
This little girl you keep pushing away,

34:30.585 --> 34:32.150
she's still here,

34:32.186 --> 34:35.011
and she needs to know that you love her,

34:35.130 --> 34:36.318
you've got her back.

34:37.603 --> 34:40.518
You can't save yourself
without saving her.

34:41.228 --> 34:44.601
And you can't do that
until you face the fact that

34:45.121 --> 34:47.074
you just got a really raw deal.

34:48.202 --> 34:50.795
- It sucks.
- I know.

34:53.505 --> 34:54.973
(chuckles)

34:55.007 --> 34:55.974
(sniffs)

34:56.094 --> 34:58.105
I have a friend who's transgender.

34:58.616 --> 34:59.611
Really?

34:59.971 --> 35:02.189
You're giving me the, uh,
"I have a friend" speech?

35:02.253 --> 35:04.569
You know, we don't all
know each other, right?

35:04.644 --> 35:05.851
- I know that.
- (laughs)

35:05.886 --> 35:06.985
I didn't...

35:07.020 --> 35:08.702
His name's Cole.

35:08.985 --> 35:11.943
Oh, wow, well, actually,
I, uh... I do know Cole.

35:11.959 --> 35:13.944
- (laughs)
- He's a great guy.

35:13.961 --> 35:16.288
(both laughing)

35:17.864 --> 35:20.505
Sorry, I didn't even
ask you why you're here.

35:20.559 --> 35:22.871
Oh, uh, one of the lawyers from the JJC

35:22.903 --> 35:25.653
got the police to send
over the missing fax page.

35:25.773 --> 35:28.106
- And?
- Nothing remarkable:

35:28.373 --> 35:31.336
blood spatter analysis and
stuff about the murder weapon,

35:31.456 --> 35:33.779
angle and direction of impact,

35:33.814 --> 35:35.714
probable height and
weight of the killer...

35:35.978 --> 35:37.844
nothing really useful.

35:37.914 --> 35:39.145
The missing page was

35:39.350 --> 35:41.469
probably just an oversight.

35:42.464 --> 35:44.089
So we're probably just wasting our time.

35:48.128 --> 35:49.729
(sighs)

35:58.351 --> 35:59.905
Why did you lie to Mom?

36:02.336 --> 36:03.842
Lie about what?

36:05.012 --> 36:07.197
Emma and I followed
you after school today.

36:08.338 --> 36:09.815
Are you serious?

36:10.678 --> 36:12.264
I can't believe you did that!

36:12.296 --> 36:14.853
Yeah, and I can't believe
you're still seeing Nick!

36:14.888 --> 36:16.529
Are you sure you're
not the one who's crazy?

36:16.551 --> 36:18.202
Keep your voice down.

36:19.154 --> 36:20.160
Look...

36:20.779 --> 36:21.760
(sighs)

36:21.795 --> 36:24.129
When I went to go see
Nick at the hospital,

36:24.678 --> 36:27.766
he told me that I was the only
reason he didn't kill himself,

36:28.115 --> 36:29.889
that I was his only reason for living.

36:29.911 --> 36:31.417
- So?
- So!

36:31.723 --> 36:34.391
Every time he gets to a
phone, he texts me that

36:34.681 --> 36:36.708
he can't go on without me,

36:37.498 --> 36:39.176
and that if he didn't have me,

36:39.296 --> 36:41.947
he'd like end it all right now.

36:42.474 --> 36:44.426
I couldn't tell him it was over.

36:45.469 --> 36:46.561
Not yet.

36:47.707 --> 36:48.954
He just...

36:50.342 --> 36:52.289
needs some time to get better.

36:53.079 --> 36:54.930
And what does it matter if he thinks

36:54.962 --> 36:56.928
that I'm his girlfriend
as long as he's locked up.

36:56.964 --> 36:57.929
(Mariana sighs)

36:59.432 --> 37:01.631
Dad should be back home by now.

37:03.535 --> 37:05.148
Hope Dana lets him in the house.

37:05.165 --> 37:06.137
(chuckles)

37:07.941 --> 37:09.674
(sighs deeply)

37:11.178 --> 37:12.544
I think we're gonna have to help them

37:12.571 --> 37:15.410
get out from under this. I don't
think my dad can do it alone.

37:15.716 --> 37:17.582
You saw how broken he is.

37:21.680 --> 37:24.047
I'm not sure what we can do.

37:29.823 --> 37:33.965

37:35.175 --> 37:39.810

38:54.378 --> 38:56.047
Still nervous for the midterm?

38:56.083 --> 38:58.240
Nah, I'm all good.

39:01.564 --> 39:03.770
You wrote the code in LabVIEW?

39:04.107 --> 39:05.263
Yeah, and?

39:05.333 --> 39:07.958
No one on the team knows LabVIEW.

39:07.995 --> 39:11.083
- So what?
- So what if we have to change something?

39:11.110 --> 39:13.439
- Well, then I'll change it.
- And what if you're not there?

39:13.514 --> 39:16.020
Or what if we have to ask one
of the other teams for help?

39:16.036 --> 39:17.397
What's the big deal?

39:17.456 --> 39:20.027
You should have done it in Java or C++.

39:20.080 --> 39:21.906
Well, too late.

39:21.942 --> 39:23.942
No, it's not too late. Do it over.

39:24.254 --> 39:25.844
I'm not doing it over.

39:25.879 --> 39:27.812
Look, you said we're behind anyways,

39:28.121 --> 39:30.749
you know, 'cause you made the
wrong call on the omni wheels.

39:32.714 --> 39:34.569
Do it again in Java.

39:34.755 --> 39:36.365
Why're you being such a bitch?

39:36.397 --> 39:38.759
Because bitches get things done.

39:39.582 --> 39:41.693
Do it in Java or you're off the team.

39:43.897 --> 39:45.314
You know what?

39:45.766 --> 39:47.229
Code it yourself.

39:48.009 --> 39:50.015
I'm out. Who's with me?

40:11.750 --> 40:13.158
- (splashes)
- (Callie laughs)

40:13.193 --> 40:15.380
What? What was that for?

40:15.617 --> 40:17.865
You have just been water ninja'ed.

40:18.031 --> 40:19.164
I'm your target?

40:19.199 --> 40:22.000
No, no, I just wanted to
prove to you that I can be fun.

40:22.035 --> 40:23.303
It's a good shot, right?

40:23.335 --> 40:25.036
Yeah, and with your left hand too,

40:25.072 --> 40:26.037
It's pretty good.

40:26.073 --> 40:27.972
Oh, you are so gonna get it.

40:28.008 --> 40:28.973
(Callie giggles) I hope so.

40:29.186 --> 40:30.075
(bell rings)

40:30.531 --> 40:33.445
- I'll see you later?
- Not if I see you first.

40:39.656 --> 40:40.985
(lock ratchets)

40:52.099 --> 40:54.301
(typing)

40:54.511 --> 40:56.000
(rings)

40:56.258 --> 40:58.646
Hey, Aaron, it's Callie.

40:58.657 --> 41:01.314
Um, I think I might
know why the prosecutor

41:01.314 --> 41:04.041
didn't want Kyle's lawyer
to see the forensics report.

41:04.218 --> 41:06.634
It says that the killer was right-handed,

41:06.639 --> 41:09.403
but Kyle's not. He's left-handed.

41:10.083 --> 41:11.950
Well, you have a lovely home,

41:11.985 --> 41:16.007
and there is a huge demand
for Craftsmans in San Diego.

41:16.022 --> 41:18.890
I don't think you'll have any
trouble selling your house.

41:18.925 --> 41:21.580
I'd love the opportunity
to be your realtor.

41:24.351 --> 41:26.432
- Synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -
all.

33:35.201 --> 33:36.330
I'm not worried.

33:41.735 --> 33:43.564
(sighs)

33:44.485 --> 33:47.954
It's like the most
depressing scrapbook ever.

33:48.311 --> 33:50.623
This was a horrible idea. No
one's gonna want to see this.

33:50.644 --> 33:53.605
I don't want to see this. I
hate that this is my story.

33:53.659 --> 33:56.948
I just want to pretend it never happened.

33:58.052 --> 33:59.051
But you can't.

33:59.747 --> 34:00.645
Look,

34:01.005 --> 34:03.167
it's hard to look back on the rough stuff.

34:04.748 --> 34:08.458
I mean, I'm transgender, I get it.

34:10.906 --> 34:13.518
When I see pictures
before my transition...

34:13.917 --> 34:15.127
(sighs)

34:15.176 --> 34:16.768
I see how sad I was. (chuckles)

34:17.429 --> 34:18.472
I just wanted to

34:19.091 --> 34:21.219
erase the first 16 years of my life,

34:21.947 --> 34:25.195
but you can't let go of
all that pain and sadness

34:25.212 --> 34:26.534
when you lock it in.

34:28.309 --> 34:30.466
This little girl you keep pushing away,

34:30.585 --> 34:32.150
she's still here,

34:32.186 --> 34:35.011
and she needs to know that you love her,

34:35.130 --> 34:36.318
you've got her back.

34:37.603 --> 34:40.518
You can't save yourself
without saving her.

34:41.228 --> 34:44.601
And you can't do that
until you face the fact that

34:45.121 --> 34:47.074
you just got a really raw deal.

34:48.202 --> 34:50.795
- It sucks.
- I know.

34:53.505 --> 34:54.973
(chuckles)

34:55.007 --> 34:55.974
(sniffs)

34:56.094 --> 34:58.105
I have a friend who's transgender.

34:58.616 --> 34:59.611
Really?

34:59.971 --> 35:02.189
You're giving me the, uh,
"I have a friend" speech?

35:02.253 --> 35:04.569
You know, we don't all
know each other, right?

35:04.644 --> 35:05.851
- I know that.
- (laughs)

35:05.886 --> 35:06.985
I didn't...

35:07.020 --> 35:08.702
His name's Cole.

35:08.985 --> 35:11.943
Oh, wow, well, actually,
I, uh... I do know Cole.

35:11.959 --> 35:13.944
- (laughs)
- He's a great guy.

35:13.961 --> 35:16.288
(both laughing)

35:17.864 --> 35:20.505
Sorry, I didn't even
ask you why you're here.

35:20.559 --> 35:22.871
Oh, uh, one of the lawyers from the JJC

35:22.903 --> 35:25.653
got the police to send
over the missing fax page.

35:25.773 --> 35:28.106
- And?
- Nothing remarkable:

35:28.373 --> 35:31.336
blood spatter analysis and
stuff about the murder weapon,

35:31.456 --> 35:33.779
angle and direction of impact,

35:33.814 --> 35:35.714
probable height and
weight of the killer...

35:35.978 --> 35:37.844
nothing really useful.

35:37.914 --> 35:39.145
The missing page was

35:39.350 --> 35:41.469
probably just an oversight.

35:42.464 --> 35:44.089
So we're probably just wasting our time.

35:48.128 --> 35:49.729
(sighs)

35:58.351 --> 35:59.905
Why did you lie to Mom?

36:02.336 --> 36:03.842
Lie about what?

36:05.012 --> 36:07.197
Emma and I followed
you after school today.

36:08.338 --> 36:09.815
Are you serious?

36:10.678 --> 36:12.264
I can't believe you did that!

36:12.296 --> 36:14.853
Yeah, and I can't believe
you're still seeing Nick!

36:14.888 --> 36:16.529
Are you sure you're
not the one who's crazy?

36:16.551 --> 36:18.202
Keep your voice down.

36:19.154 --> 36:20.160
Look...

36:20.779 --> 36:21.760
(sighs)

36:21.795 --> 36:24.129
When I went to go see
Nick at the hospital,

36:24.678 --> 36:27.766
he told me that I was the only
reason he didn't kill himself,

36:28.115 --> 36:29.889
that I was his only reason for living.

36:29.911 --> 36:31.417
- So?
- So!

36:31.723 --> 36:34.391
Every time he gets to a
phone, he texts me that

36:34.681 --> 36:36.708
he can't go on without me,

36:37.498 --> 36:39.176
and that if he didn't have me,

36:39.296 --> 36:41.947
he'd like end it all right now.

36:42.474 --> 36:44.426
I couldn't tell him it was over.

36:45.469 --> 36:46.561
Not yet.

36:47.707 --> 36:48.954
He just...

36:50.342 --> 36:52.289
needs some time to get better.

36:53.079 --> 36:54.930
And what does it matter if he thinks

36:54.962 --> 36:56.928
that I'm his girlfriend
as long as he's locked up.

36:56.964 --> 36:57.929
(Mariana sighs)

36:59.432 --> 37:01.631
Dad should be back home by now.

37:03.535 --> 37:05.148
Hope Dana lets him in the house.

37:05.165 --> 37:06.137
(chuckles)

37:07.941 --> 37:09.674
(sighs deeply)

37:11.178 --> 37:12.544
I think we're gonna have to help them

37:12.571 --> 37:15.410
get out from under this. I don't
think my dad can do it alone.

37:15.716 --> 37:17.582
You saw how broken he is.

37:21.680 --> 37:24.047
I'm not sure what we can do.

37:29.823 --> 37:33.965

38:54.378 --> 38:56.047
Still nervous for the midterm?

38:56.083 --> 38:58.240
Nah, I'm all good.

39:01.564 --> 39:03.770
You wrote the code in LabVIEW?

39:04.107 --> 39:05.263
Yeah, and?

39:05.333 --> 39:07.958
No one on the team knows LabVIEW.

39:07.995 --> 39:11.083
- So what?
- So what if we have to change something?

39:11.110 --> 39:13.439
- Well, then I'll change it.
- And what if you're not there?

39:13.514 --> 39:16.020
Or what if we have to ask one
of the other teams for help?

39:16.036 --> 39:17.397
What's the big deal?

39:17.456 --> 39:20.027
You should have done it in Java or C++.

39:20.080 --> 39:21.906
Well, too late.

39:21.942 --> 39:23.942
No, it's not too late. Do it over.

39:24.254 --> 39:25.844
I'm not doing it over.
