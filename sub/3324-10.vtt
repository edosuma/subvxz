00:02.003 --> 00:03.038
Previously on "Teen Wolf:"

00:03.212 --> 00:04.201
Are you real?

00:04.380 --> 00:05.620
Not yet.

00:11.429 --> 00:13.169
I heard there was a party.

00:13.389 --> 00:16.131
But don't worry. I invited myself.

00:17.810 --> 00:19.050
Now.

00:19.270 --> 00:21.101
Our sons are trained to be soldiers.

00:21.314 --> 00:22.679
Our daughters, to be leaders.

00:22.899 --> 00:25.015
"The Kdnimo seeks a master."
Someone's controlling him.

00:25.234 --> 00:27.566
What if it's Matt and this whole thing
comes back to the video, right?

00:27.778 --> 00:29.564
You need a digital camera.

00:35.870 --> 00:38.407
I'm starting to feel weird about this.

00:38.623 --> 00:41.114
This doesn't have anything to do
with Allison, does it?

00:41.334 --> 00:43.040
You have a little thing for Allison, Matt?

00:43.252 --> 00:44.503
A little crush?

00:44.921 --> 00:45.876
No.

00:46.047 --> 00:47.378
You think I'm gonna waste my time

00:47.590 --> 00:50.832
by doing something as unbelievably
ordinary as making a sex tape?

00:54.055 --> 00:55.636
Documenting history.

00:57.266 --> 00:58.927
You'll get it back tomorrow.

01:34.762 --> 01:36.218
Son of a bitch.

01:36.764 --> 01:38.470
I knew you were lying.

02:04.125 --> 02:05.410
What the hell?

03:56.028 --> 03:57.484
So this kid's the real killer?

03:57.697 --> 03:58.652
Yeah.

04:00.199 --> 04:01.154
No.

04:01.367 --> 04:02.903
- Yes.
- No.

04:03.119 --> 04:04.905
Dad, come on.
Everybody knows that the police

04:05.079 --> 04:06.944
look for ways to connect victims
in a murder, okay?

04:07.164 --> 04:09.155
So all you have to do is, like,
look through their transcripts

04:09.375 --> 04:11.240
and figure out which class they
all had in common.

04:11.460 --> 04:13.712
Yeah, except for the fact
that the rave promoter, Kara,

04:13.921 --> 04:16.458
- wasn't in Harris's class.
- All right, okay, you're right, sorry.

04:16.674 --> 04:18.710
Then I guess they dropped
the charges against him?

04:20.136 --> 04:22.218
No, you know what?
They're not dropping the charges.

04:22.430 --> 04:24.295
But that doesn't prove anything.

04:24.849 --> 04:26.589
Scott, do you believe this?

04:26.809 --> 04:29.972
It's really hard to explain how we know this,
but you just gotta trust us.

04:30.187 --> 04:32.803
- We know it's Matt.
- Yeah, he took Harris's car, okay?

04:33.023 --> 04:35.435
Look, he knew that if a cop
tound tire tracks at one of the murders,

04:35.651 --> 04:38.358
and that it enough of the victims were in
Harris's class, that they'd arrest him.

04:38.571 --> 04:40.027
All right, fine.

04:40.239 --> 04:42.230
l'll allow the remote possibility,
but give me a motive.

04:42.450 --> 04:43.906
I mean, why would this kid

04:44.118 --> 04:47.656
want most of the 2006 swim team
and its coach dead?

04:47.872 --> 04:49.863
Isn't it obvious?

04:50.958 --> 04:52.289
Our swim team sucks!

04:52.501 --> 04:54.162
They haven't won in, like, six years.

04:54.378 --> 04:56.369
Okay, we don't have a motive yet.

04:56.589 --> 04:58.705
I mean, come on, does Harris?

04:59.717 --> 05:01.127
What do you want me to do?

05:02.595 --> 05:04.131
We need to look at the evidence.

05:04.346 --> 05:07.213
Yeah, that would be in the station,
where | no longer work.

05:07.433 --> 05:10.220
- Trust me, they'll let you in.
- Trust you?

05:12.229 --> 05:13.264
Trust...

05:14.231 --> 05:15.482
Trust Scott?

05:17.568 --> 05:19.058
Scott, I trust.

05:23.657 --> 05:24.817
It's 2:00 in the morning.

05:25.034 --> 05:27.571
Believe me, I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't extremely important.

05:27.787 --> 05:30.199
We look at the hospital stutt first, okay?

05:30.414 --> 05:31.039
Why?

05:31.248 --> 05:34.536
Because all the murders were committed
by Jackson, except for one, you remember?

05:34.752 --> 05:36.834
- The pregnant girl, Jessica.
- Yeah.

05:37.046 --> 05:40.163
Since Matt had to kill her himself,
somebody from the hospital could've seen him.

05:42.968 --> 05:44.128
Thank you.

05:44.345 --> 05:45.300
Boys.

05:50.643 --> 05:52.383
I don't know, guys.
I mean, look at this.

05:52.603 --> 05:54.218
There was a six-car pileup that night.

05:54.438 --> 05:56.144
- The hospital was jammed.
- All right, just keep going.

05:56.357 --> 05:59.064
Look, he had to pass one of the cameras
on that floor to get to Jessica, okay?

05:59.276 --> 06:01.232
He's gotta be on the footage somewhere.

06:01.445 --> 06:04.061
Oh, hold on, stop! Did you see that?
Scroll back.

06:06.325 --> 06:07.360
That's him! That's Matt!

06:09.495 --> 06:11.736
- All | see is the back of someone's head.
- Matt's head, yeah.

06:11.956 --> 06:15.744
I sit behind him in history.
He's got a very distinct cranium, it's weird.

06:15.960 --> 06:18.702
- Are you crazy?
- All right, fine, then look at his jacket, huh?

06:18.921 --> 06:21.287
How many people do you know
who wear black leather jackets?

06:21.507 --> 06:24.340
- Millions, literally.
- Okay, can we scroll forward?

06:24.552 --> 06:27.089
There's gotta be a shot of him
coming at one of the cameras.

06:29.014 --> 06:30.754
Right there! Stop! Stop! See?
There he is again.

06:30.975 --> 06:32.966
You mean there's
the back of his head again.

06:33.185 --> 06:35.471
Okay, but look.
He's talking to someone.

06:39.775 --> 06:41.515
He's talking to my mom.

06:41.735 --> 06:44.397
Scott, you know how many people
I deal with in a day?

06:44.613 --> 06:48.151
This one's 16. He's got dark hair,
looks like a normal teenager.

06:48.367 --> 06:49.447
Yeah, he looks evil.

06:49.660 --> 06:51.446
Scott, I already
talked to the police about this.

06:51.662 --> 06:54.199
Okay, Mom, I'm gonna take
a picture and send it to you.

07:02.089 --> 07:03.499
Do you recognize him?
Do you remember him?

07:03.924 --> 07:05.380
Yeah, I did.

07:05.593 --> 07:09.461
I mean, I remember I stopped him because
he was tracking mud in the hall.

07:09.680 --> 07:10.795
Scott, what's going on?

07:11.015 --> 07:14.052
It's nothing, Mom.
I'll explain later. I gotta go.

07:14.685 --> 07:18.143
We've got shoe prints alongside
the tire tracks at the trailer site.

07:18.314 --> 07:20.350
And if they match, that puts Matt
at the scene of three murders.

07:20.524 --> 07:22.731
- The trailer, the hospital, and the rave.
- Actually, four.

07:22.902 --> 07:25.359
A credit card receipt for an oil change
was signed by Matt

07:25.571 --> 07:27.357
at the garage where
the mechanic was killed.

07:27.573 --> 07:30.155
- When?
- A couple hours before you got there.

07:30.326 --> 07:32.317
All right, Dad, if one's an incident,
two's a coincidence,

07:32.536 --> 07:33.992
and three's a pattern, what's four?

07:34.663 --> 07:36.369
Four's enough for a warrant.

07:36.582 --> 07:38.948
Scott, call your mom back,
see how quick she can get here.

07:39.168 --> 07:41.784
If I can get an official I.D.,
I can get a search warrant.

07:42.004 --> 07:44.541
Stiles, go to the front desk. Tell them to let
Scott's mom in when she gets here.

07:44.715 --> 07:45.670
On it.

07:53.474 --> 07:54.589
Hello?

08:17.081 --> 08:20.448
Derek! Derek!

08:20.668 --> 08:25.458
Derek... Can you hear me?

08:26.674 --> 08:28.630
I need you to answer me, Derek.

08:29.468 --> 08:30.583
Derek!

08:30.803 --> 08:32.885
We don't have much time.

08:42.439 --> 08:44.851
That sound. What was it?

08:53.409 --> 08:55.866
You're gonna be weak
for several hours.

09:06.422 --> 09:08.333
- It actually happened.
- Don't worry.

09:08.549 --> 09:11.632
You're still an Alpha.
But, as usual,

09:12.386 --> 09:14.752
not a particularly competent one.

09:15.597 --> 09:17.258
- Where is he?
- | wish I could tell you.

09:17.474 --> 09:19.681
Then how about you tell me
what you're doing here,

09:19.893 --> 09:21.554
and why you're helping me?

09:21.770 --> 09:25.763
Helping your family actually used to be
a pretty important part of my life.

09:26.567 --> 09:30.185
Helping you was a promise I made
to your mother.

09:33.449 --> 09:35.030
You're the one
my sister talked about.

09:35.242 --> 09:36.982
She said you're a...

09:37.995 --> 09:40.111
- kind of advisor?
- She was right.

09:40.330 --> 09:44.699
And l have some advice that you need to
listen to very closely right now.

09:44.918 --> 09:48.285
What Peter managed to do
doesn't come without a price.

09:48.505 --> 09:53.750
He'll be physically weak, so he'll rely on
the strength of his intelligence, his cunning.

09:53.969 --> 09:55.584
He's gonna come at you, Derek.

09:55.804 --> 09:59.763
He'll try to twist his way inside your head,
preying on your insecurities.

09:59.975 --> 10:02.717
He'll tell you that he's the only way
you can stop Gerard.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.551
Do not trust him.

10:04.772 --> 10:06.182
I don't trust anyone.

10:06.398 --> 10:08.059
I know.

10:08.275 --> 10:11.688
If you did, you might be the Alpha
you like to think you are.

10:11.904 --> 10:15.192
And unfortunately, the one person
you should trust doesn't trust you at all.

10:15.866 --> 10:17.857
- Scott.
- He's with Stilinski right now.

10:18.035 --> 10:20.902
You need to find him,
you need to find him as fast as you can.

10:21.121 --> 10:24.158
I've known Gerard for a long time.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.116
He always has a plan.

10:28.295 --> 10:29.831
And something tells me...

10:31.715 --> 10:34.422
It's going exactly the way
he wants it to.

10:38.388 --> 10:39.673
She's on her way here.

10:41.433 --> 10:42.548
Sheriff?

10:48.732 --> 10:51.144
Matt? It's Matt, right?

10:51.610 --> 10:53.896
Matt, whatever's going on,
I guarantee you there's a solution

10:54.113 --> 10:56.399
- that doesn't involve a gun.
- You know, it's funny you say that,

10:56.615 --> 10:59.527
because I don't think you're aware
of just how right you are.

11:00.869 --> 11:04.703
- I know you don't wanna hurt people.
- Actually, I wanna hurt a lot of people.

11:04.915 --> 11:06.200
You three weren't on my list,

11:06.416 --> 11:08.156
but I could be persuaded.

11:08.377 --> 11:09.867
And one way is to try dialing

11:10.045 --> 11:12.377
somebody on your cell phone,
like McCall is doing.

11:14.383 --> 11:16.874
That could definitely get someone hurt.

11:17.511 --> 11:18.591
Everyone.

11:20.139 --> 11:21.879
- Now!
- Come on.

11:29.356 --> 11:30.345
Tighter.

11:31.316 --> 11:32.692
Do what he says, Stiles.

11:49.835 --> 11:51.791
What, are you gonna
kill everyone in here?

11:52.004 --> 11:54.211
No, that's what Jackson's for.

11:54.423 --> 11:57.506
| just think about killing them,
and he does it.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.553
- Sweetheart.
- I don't wanna talk.

12:13.358 --> 12:17.067
I understand.
I'm not sure if there's anything I can say.

12:18.155 --> 12:20.362
I won't pretend to know
what you're going through.

12:20.574 --> 12:21.939
Then leave.

12:23.702 --> 12:24.657
Of course.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.987
I just wanted to give you
something from your mother.

12:29.374 --> 12:32.537
Partly because I couldn't help noticing
that things have been kind of

12:32.753 --> 12:35.039
difficult between you two.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.791
But it can wait.

12:37.883 --> 12:39.214
What?

12:40.177 --> 12:41.166
What is it?

12:41.386 --> 12:43.798
No, really, sweetheart, it can wait.

12:44.014 --> 12:46.471
- You get some rest.
- What is it?

12:49.228 --> 12:50.809
As you know,

12:50.979 --> 12:56.064
your mother wrote a suicide note to
explain away our difficult situation

12:56.276 --> 12:57.777
to the police.

12:58.779 --> 13:02.112
She wrote this note to explain it to you.

13:03.700 --> 13:07.409
If I give this to you,
you have to destroy it immediately.

13:07.621 --> 13:09.532
You burn it.

13:10.791 --> 13:11.871
You promise?

13:12.459 --> 13:13.665
Yes.

13:13.877 --> 13:16.835
I want you to know
she asked me to read it.

13:17.047 --> 13:18.503
I told her I shouldn't,

13:18.674 --> 13:21.757
that it was private
between the two of you.

13:21.969 --> 13:23.550
But she wanted my thoughts.

13:24.638 --> 13:27.971
As I said before, I don't know
what you're going through.

13:28.183 --> 13:30.765
I wasn't close to my own mother.

13:35.065 --> 13:39.149
But reading this made me sorry
I hadn't tried to be.

13:40.696 --> 13:43.153
Because if this were my mother,

13:43.573 --> 13:46.360
if these words were written for me,

13:47.703 --> 13:50.115
I don't know how I could sit still

13:50.330 --> 13:53.242
until someone paid for her death.

13:54.376 --> 13:58.289
Any pity I'd have for Derek and his pack

13:58.505 --> 14:03.716
would be burned on by
a white-hot desire for retribution,

14:03.927 --> 14:10.139
or a kind of blood and destruction that
would have Derek and his wolves

14:10.350 --> 14:15.765
howling not for mercy,
but for their own sweet deaths.

14:47.596 --> 14:50.087
Deleted. And we're done.

14:50.265 --> 14:53.098
And, so, Matt, since all the people
you brutally murdered deserved it

14:53.310 --> 14:56.473
because they killed you first,
whatever that means,

14:57.272 --> 14:58.512
we're good here, right?

14:58.690 --> 15:00.305
I'll just get my dad, and we'll go,

15:00.525 --> 15:02.311
you know, you continue
on the whole vengeance thing.

15:02.527 --> 15:04.108
Enjoy the Kanima.

15:06.865 --> 15:08.730
Sounds like your mom's here, McCall.

15:08.950 --> 15:10.281
Matt, don't do this.

15:10.494 --> 15:12.200
When she comes to the door,
I'll just tell her to leave.

15:12.412 --> 15:14.903
I'll tell her we didn't find anything.
Please, Matt.

15:16.875 --> 15:18.456
If you don't move,

15:18.668 --> 15:21.284
now, I'm gonna kill Stiles first,

15:21.880 --> 15:23.871
and then your mom.

15:28.303 --> 15:29.543
Open it.

15:30.389 --> 15:31.378
Please.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.759
Open the door.

15:45.487 --> 15:46.897
Oh, thank God.

17:23.627 --> 17:25.458
This is the one controlling him?

17:25.670 --> 17:26.750
This kid?

17:27.255 --> 17:31.794
Well, Derek, not everyone's lucky
enough to be a big, bad werewolf.

17:32.010 --> 17:36.128
Oh, yeah, that's right.
I've learned a few things lately.

17:36.348 --> 17:38.259
Werewolves, hunters, Kanimas.

17:38.475 --> 17:41.091
It's like a frickin' Halloween party
every full moon.

17:41.311 --> 17:44.018
Except for you, Stiles.
What do you turn into?

17:44.231 --> 17:45.596
Abominable snowman.

17:45.815 --> 17:49.148
But, uh, it's more of, like, a
wintertime thing, you know, seasonal.

17:49.861 --> 17:51.021
Hey!

17:51.821 --> 17:53.607
You bitch.

17:57.327 --> 17:59.283
Get him off of me.

17:59.496 --> 18:00.702
Oh, I don't know, Derek.

18:00.914 --> 18:03.121
I think you two make a pretty good pair.

18:03.667 --> 18:06.875
It must kinda suck, though, to have
all that power taken away from you

18:07.087 --> 18:09.043
with just a little cut
to the back of the neck.

18:09.256 --> 18:11.338
I bet you're not used to
feeling this helpless.

18:11.550 --> 18:14.087
Still got some teeth. Why don't you
get down here a little closer, huh?

18:14.261 --> 18:16.798
- We'll see how helpless I am.
- Yeah, bitch.

18:19.474 --> 18:20.680
Is that her?

18:23.019 --> 18:24.759
Do what I tell you to
and I won't hurt her.

18:25.063 --> 18:27.850
- I won't even let Jackson near her.
- Scott, don't trust him!

18:30.527 --> 18:31.858
This work better for you?

18:32.070 --> 18:33.310
Hey, just stop! Stop!

18:33.530 --> 18:35.270
Then do what I tell you to.

18:35.490 --> 18:37.822
Okay. All right.

18:38.618 --> 18:39.653
Stop!

18:42.998 --> 18:44.408
You, take him in there.

18:44.624 --> 18:45.704
You...

18:47.043 --> 18:48.123
With me.

18:50.547 --> 18:51.502
Mom?

18:53.174 --> 18:55.551
You scared me, where is every...

18:57.512 --> 19:00.424
Mom, just do what he says.
He promised he wouldn't hurt you.

19:02.392 --> 19:03.427
He's right.

19:07.314 --> 19:09.100
Scott! Stiles!

19:09.316 --> 19:10.726
What happened?

19:10.942 --> 19:13.103
But I didn't say I wouldn't hurt you.

19:13.320 --> 19:14.810
- Baby!
- Back, back!

19:15.030 --> 19:16.440
Mom! Mom, stop, Mom!

19:21.828 --> 19:23.944
I said get back.

19:24.873 --> 19:26.033
Scott.

19:28.126 --> 19:30.242
Mom, do it. Please, Mom.

19:32.172 --> 19:33.252
Get up, McCall.

19:33.465 --> 19:36.298
- Matt! Matt, listen to me!
- Shut up! Shut up!

19:36.509 --> 19:38.010
Everybody shut the hell up!

19:39.721 --> 19:41.962
Now, get up, or I shoot her next!

19:48.146 --> 19:50.102
Please, he needs to see a doctor.

19:50.315 --> 19:52.476
- You think so?
- Hey! Hey, you listen to me!

19:52.692 --> 19:54.102
It's all right. I'm okay.

19:54.319 --> 19:56.651
- No, honey, you're not okay.
- It doesn't hurt, Mom.

19:56.863 --> 19:58.273
'Cause that's the adrenaline, okay?

19:58.490 --> 20:00.947
Please, let me...
Let me just take a look at him, okay?

20:01.117 --> 20:03.654
- I mean, I can help stop the bleeding.
- They have no idea, do they?

20:03.870 --> 20:06.111
Please. Let me just take a quick look.

20:06.331 --> 20:08.447
Shut up! Shut up!

20:10.251 --> 20:12.242
Lady, if you keep talking,

20:12.462 --> 20:15.499
I'm gonna put the next bullet
through his head.

20:16.841 --> 20:18.456
Okay, okay.

20:19.219 --> 20:20.629
Back to the front, McCall.

20:23.056 --> 20:24.216
After you.

20:30.855 --> 20:32.971
The evidence is gone.
Why don't you just go?

20:33.191 --> 20:35.056
You think the evidence
mattered that much, huh?

20:35.276 --> 20:36.857
No, no, I want the book.

20:37.070 --> 20:38.480
What? What book?

20:38.697 --> 20:39.937
The bestiary.

20:40.281 --> 20:43.023
Notjust a few pages,
I want the entire thing.

20:43.284 --> 20:44.490
I don't have it.

20:44.953 --> 20:47.160
It's Gerard's.
What do you want it for, anyway?

20:47.372 --> 20:48.782
I need answers.

20:48.998 --> 20:50.408
Answers to what?

20:51.960 --> 20:53.416
To this.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.432
- He wants the bestiary.
- That's not from Scott.

21:10.645 --> 21:12.055
He wouldn't have texted me.

21:12.272 --> 21:14.137
And he definitely wouldn't have
mentioned Derek.

21:14.399 --> 21:15.935
The sheriff's station?

21:16.109 --> 21:18.566
If Derek's really there,
I doubt it's willingly.

21:18.778 --> 21:21.360
- You think Jackson's there, too?
- Maybe.

21:21.573 --> 21:23.905
Maybe him and the one controlling him.

21:24.117 --> 21:26.324
How many
do they keep on in a night shift?

21:26.536 --> 21:28.572
Since budget cuts,
maybe four at the most.

21:28.788 --> 21:31.655
My guess would be they're either
dead or paralyzed by now.

21:31.875 --> 21:35.584
This mightjust be the confluence of
events we've been hoping for.

21:35.795 --> 21:37.205
Confluence or conflagration?

21:37.422 --> 21:39.208
I'm open to both.

21:39.424 --> 21:40.664
What do we do now?

21:41.342 --> 21:45.085
Maybe you should tell us.
That authority falls to you now.

21:46.514 --> 21:49.221
- Not at her age.
- She's almost 18.

21:49.434 --> 21:53.222
She knows there's a difference
between revenge and retribution.

21:53.438 --> 21:54.723
Don't you, Allison?

21:55.899 --> 22:00.563
Make the decision from a vantage point
of strategy over emotion,

22:01.488 --> 22:03.353
and we'll follow your lead.

22:06.326 --> 22:08.157
I want Derek dead.

22:10.079 --> 22:11.410
What about Scott?

22:12.749 --> 22:15.035
Scott's not the one who
forced my mother to kill herself.

22:15.210 --> 22:17.075
He's not exactly an
innocent bystander either.

22:17.295 --> 22:20.332
- You can't pick and choose.
- But I can prioritize.

22:21.424 --> 22:24.086
And the priority right now is Derek.

22:25.470 --> 22:27.961
And what about the others?
Derek's pack?

22:29.849 --> 22:32.306
If they try and protect him,

22:32.519 --> 22:34.180
then we kill them.

22:39.317 --> 22:40.853
All of them.

22:44.447 --> 22:45.527
Hey.

22:45.990 --> 22:48.151
You know what's happening to Matt?

22:48.827 --> 22:50.692
You know,
the book's not gonna help him.

22:50.912 --> 22:52.994
He can't just break the rules,
not like this.

22:53.206 --> 22:54.491
What do you mean?

22:54.666 --> 22:57.328
The universe balances things out.
Always does.

22:57.502 --> 23:00.494
Is it because he's using Jackson
to kill people who don't deserve it?

23:00.713 --> 23:04.626
- And killing people himself.
- So it Matt breaks the rules of the Kanima,

23:05.260 --> 23:07.091
he becomes the Kanima?

23:07.846 --> 23:09.006
Balance.

23:09.222 --> 23:11.008
Will he believe us if we tell him that?

23:11.182 --> 23:12.297
Not likely.

23:12.517 --> 23:15.259
Okay, he's gonna kill all of us
when he gets that book, isn't he?

23:15.478 --> 23:16.763
Yep.

23:16.980 --> 23:18.720
All right, so what do we do?

23:18.940 --> 23:21.852
Do we just sit here and wait to die?

23:22.068 --> 23:26.027
Unless I can figure out a way to
push the toxin out of my body faster.

23:26.281 --> 23:28.397
Like triggering the healing process.

23:30.034 --> 23:32.616
What? Oh, what are you doing?

23:32.871 --> 23:34.782
Oh, gross.

23:37.375 --> 23:38.490
There.

23:42.630 --> 23:45.246
You know,
I feel sorry for you, McCall,

23:46.217 --> 23:48.458
'cause right now, you're thinkin',

23:48.678 --> 23:50.839
"How am I gonna explain this
when it heals?"

23:51.055 --> 23:53.671
And the sad part is, you don't even
realize how incredible it is

23:53.892 --> 23:56.634
that you actually are healing.

23:56.853 --> 23:59.390
'Cause you know what happens
to everyone else when they get shot?

23:59.981 --> 24:01.312
They die.

24:05.695 --> 24:07.856
Is that what happened to you?

24:11.576 --> 24:13.282
You drowned, didn't you?

24:16.998 --> 24:19.114
He shouldn't have let them drink.

24:19.918 --> 24:21.533
What? Who?
Matt, what do you mean?

24:21.753 --> 24:22.959
La hey!

24:23.880 --> 24:25.620
He shouldn't have let them drink.

24:25.840 --> 24:28.752
- What? Who was drinking?
- The swim team, you idiot!

24:29.177 --> 24:31.213
I didn't know what was happening.

24:31.679 --> 24:33.590
I didn't know they had just won state,

24:33.806 --> 24:37.719
and Lahey, he's letting his favorites come
over to have a couple drinks to celebrate.

24:38.061 --> 24:39.767
Who cares if they're 17, right?

24:40.229 --> 24:41.218
Were you at Isaac's?

24:41.439 --> 24:46.149
He had this first edition Spider-Man,
or was it Batman?

24:47.946 --> 24:49.607
And we were gonna make a trade.

24:49.781 --> 24:52.238
But then I'm over there
and I hear music.

24:53.576 --> 24:56.067
And everyone's having a good time,
and | see Sean.

24:56.287 --> 24:57.823
He throws Jessica in the pool.

24:58.039 --> 25:00.075
And then Bennett goes in and...

25:00.291 --> 25:03.124
Bennett? What, the hunter?

25:05.088 --> 25:06.794
And then Camden.

25:08.299 --> 25:11.086
Isaac's jarhead brother,
he grabs me.

25:12.428 --> 25:13.884
He thinks it's funny.

25:14.847 --> 25:16.428
They threw you in.

25:23.064 --> 25:27.182
l yell that I can't swim,
but nobody listens.

25:27.819 --> 25:30.526
| go under and | swallow water,

25:30.738 --> 25:32.194
and no one cares.

25:32.407 --> 25:34.238
And | see these bodies underwater.

25:34.450 --> 25:38.819
| see Jessica's got her hands
down Sean's board shorts.

25:39.914 --> 25:41.745
Tucker's grabbing Kara.

25:42.333 --> 25:43.948
And I'm drowning.

25:44.711 --> 25:47.327
I'm dying, and they're laughing.

25:50.341 --> 25:51.922
All of a sudden, I'm just...

25:52.135 --> 25:54.000
I'm lying by the pool.

25:54.220 --> 25:57.303
And Lahey is right there,
right above me, and he says...

25:57.932 --> 25:59.968
- You tell no one!
- He says, "You tell no one!"

26:00.184 --> 26:03.017
- This, this is your fault!
- "This, this is your fault!"

26:03.229 --> 26:04.184
You don't know how to swim?

26:04.355 --> 26:06.596
"What little bastard
doesn't know how to swim?"

26:06.816 --> 26:10.229
You say nothing!
You tell no one! No one!

26:11.070 --> 26:12.685
And I didn't.

26:13.531 --> 26:15.396
I didn't tell anyone.

26:15.575 --> 26:17.111
And I would see them at school,

26:17.326 --> 26:18.782
and they wouldn't even look at me.

26:18.995 --> 26:21.953
l'd wake up in the middle of the night.
I'd gasp for breath.

26:22.165 --> 26:24.827
And my parents,
they thought I was asthmatic.

26:25.043 --> 26:27.159
They even gave me an inhaler.

26:27.378 --> 26:31.166
They didn't know that every time
I closed my eyes, I...

26:31.924 --> 26:33.460
l was drowning.

26:37.430 --> 26:42.174
You know about that little white light that
they talk about, you see when you die?

26:43.061 --> 26:44.642
Well, I didn't see anything.

26:45.897 --> 26:48.730
Just darkness.

26:50.526 --> 26:52.312
Everything was dark.

26:54.238 --> 26:55.648
But then...

26:56.616 --> 26:58.698
Then came the Argent's funeral,

26:58.910 --> 27:00.866
and everything changed.

27:01.662 --> 27:03.698
Can we get a few words?

27:03.915 --> 27:05.121
- Mrs. Argent!
- Please!

27:09.295 --> 27:10.831
l was taking some photos.

27:11.047 --> 27:13.129
And then, purely by accident,

27:14.842 --> 27:18.175
Lahey gets in one of the photos.
I look down at the screen on my camera,

27:18.346 --> 27:21.133
and ljust have this unbelievable rage
that fills up inside of me,

27:21.349 --> 27:23.340
and ljust...
I look at him, and l...

27:23.559 --> 27:25.174
I wanna see him dead.

27:28.940 --> 27:32.478
And the next day, he actually was.

27:36.572 --> 27:38.688
You know, Einstein was right.

27:39.408 --> 27:41.660
Imagination is more important
than knowledge.

27:41.869 --> 27:44.406
It was like something out of
Greek mythology. Like...

27:44.622 --> 27:48.206
Like the furies coming
down to punish Orestes.

27:48.918 --> 27:51.330
You have no idea what
I'm talking about, do you?

27:51.546 --> 27:54.083
Was he the guy who
stabbed out his eyes?

27:54.298 --> 27:56.835
God, that's Oedipus,
you dumbass!

27:58.052 --> 28:01.010
The furies are deities of vengeance.

28:01.222 --> 28:04.134
Their tears ran of blood,
and they had snakes for hair.

28:04.350 --> 28:06.341
If there was a crime that
had gone unpunished,

28:06.519 --> 28:09.181
the furies would do the punishing.

28:13.860 --> 28:16.897
Jackson is my fury.

28:19.824 --> 28:21.530
When I saw him the next night,

28:23.286 --> 28:27.154
it was like this bond had been
cemented between the two of us.

28:29.333 --> 28:31.585
I knew he had killed Lahey for me,

28:31.752 --> 28:34.038
and I knew he would do it again.

28:35.631 --> 28:37.792
So I went to Tucker's garage.

28:39.427 --> 28:41.713
I even paid for an oil change.
And guess what?

28:41.929 --> 28:43.385
He didn't even recognize me.

28:43.848 --> 28:46.214
So when he wasn't looking,

28:46.475 --> 28:48.602
I took a shot of him with my camera.

28:49.645 --> 28:52.603
And in a few hours, he was dead.

28:54.150 --> 28:55.811
Help!

28:59.071 --> 29:01.107
So I took more pictures.

29:05.286 --> 29:07.197
All I had to do was take their picture.

29:16.214 --> 29:18.796
And Jackson would take their life.

29:21.469 --> 29:24.176
So is that hypothetical situation
we talked about

29:24.347 --> 29:26.087
getting any less hypothetical?

29:27.308 --> 29:28.673
I think so.

29:29.393 --> 29:31.099
I can move my toes.

29:32.396 --> 29:34.728
Dude, I can move my toes.

29:39.028 --> 29:40.234
What is this?

29:41.906 --> 29:44.648
- What's that? What's going on?
- I don't know.

30:09.725 --> 30:15.516
Shakespeare wrote that love is
a smoke made with the fume of sighs.

30:16.816 --> 30:18.932
Let's give them some love.

30:44.302 --> 30:46.418
Take him! Go!

31:45.488 --> 31:46.728
Don't move.

31:47.948 --> 31:49.484
You know what I mean.

31:53.245 --> 31:54.325
Allison.

31:54.497 --> 31:56.863
- Where's Derek?
- What are you doing?

31:57.083 --> 32:00.246
If you're not going to tell me,
then get out of my way.

32:00.878 --> 32:02.118
Allison.

32:02.338 --> 32:03.828
Where is he?

32:05.716 --> 32:07.752
- What happened?
- Scott...

32:08.844 --> 32:11.631
Scott, you need to stay away
from me right now.

32:14.141 --> 32:15.256
You need to go.

32:15.476 --> 32:17.512
Just stay out of my way.

34:34.031 --> 34:36.397
You should've given me a chance.

34:40.162 --> 34:41.948
'Cause remember how I said

34:42.164 --> 34:44.655
I'm not the kind of guy
who would say something like,

34:44.875 --> 34:47.742
"Well, if I can't have her, no one can"?

34:48.629 --> 34:51.621
It's not totally true because, Allison,

34:53.259 --> 34:55.341
if I can't have you,

34:55.553 --> 34:57.384
no one can!

35:28.335 --> 35:29.745
- God!
- Come on! Come on!

35:29.962 --> 35:31.327
Come on, you can do it.

35:31.547 --> 35:33.412
Come on! Come on!

36:04.038 --> 36:05.118
Matt?

36:05.706 --> 36:07.537
Matt, please, listen to me.

36:07.750 --> 36:09.911
My son has been shot,
and I've heard other gunfire,

36:10.127 --> 36:13.210
and I don't know what's happening, but
can you please just let me see my son?

36:13.422 --> 36:16.084
How totally clueless are you people?

37:18.445 --> 37:20.026
Oh, God, Scott?

37:20.614 --> 37:22.195
Scott, are you okay?

37:23.492 --> 37:24.607
Scott?

37:48.392 --> 37:49.427
No!

37:54.815 --> 37:55.770
No!

38:10.956 --> 38:13.413
What are you doing here?
It wasn't supposed to happen like this.

38:13.959 --> 38:15.574
Trust me, I'm aware of that.

38:15.794 --> 38:18.126
I've done everything that
you've asked of me.

38:18.338 --> 38:20.670
I'm part of Derek's pack, I've given you
all the information that you wanted,

38:20.883 --> 38:22.339
I told you Matt was
controlling Jackson...

38:22.551 --> 38:23.882
And leave him to us.

38:24.094 --> 38:25.300
Help your friends.

38:25.512 --> 38:28.254
Leave Matt and Jackson to me.

38:28.974 --> 38:30.885
Deal with your mother.

38:31.727 --> 38:32.762
Go!

38:37.649 --> 38:39.355
- You dropped this.
- Go!

40:22.921 --> 40:24.912
No longer afraid of the water?

40:28.969 --> 40:32.177
Well, you don't have to be
afraid of anything, my friend.

40:43.150 --> 40:44.515
Especially me.
