00:03.440 --> 00:07.035
<i>I'm a sick man. Last night,</i>
<i>after three years of chasing Elliot,</i>

00:07.120 --> 00:11.033
<i>I convinced her to dump her boyfriend,</i>
<i>and then realised I don't want her.</i>

00:11.120 --> 00:12.758
<i>What's wrong with me?</i>

00:12.840 --> 00:17.630
<i>She doesn't have to get up till nine,</i>
<i>and she's an incredibly heavy sleeper.</i>

00:22.360 --> 00:24.749
<i>An incredibly heavy sleeper.</i>

00:28.840 --> 00:31.354
<i>I needed to talk to someone</i>
<i>who understood me,</i>

00:31.440 --> 00:34.557
<i>someone I had recently</i>
<i>been intimate with.</i>

00:36.200 --> 00:37.872
<i>Not him.</i>

00:37.960 --> 00:40.155
This is Larry. Larry, this is JD.

00:40.240 --> 00:44.279
- I'll go put on some underwear.
- Please, Larry.

00:44.360 --> 00:47.875
- What are you doing with that guy?
- I thought I'd date a celebrity.

00:47.960 --> 00:49.678
He's not a celebrity.

00:49.760 --> 00:50.988
<i>Wait a second.</i>

00:51.080 --> 00:53.594
Are you the Soup Nazi from <i>Seinfeld?</i>

00:53.680 --> 00:55.352
No.

00:55.440 --> 00:57.476
Say the soup thing.

00:57.560 --> 00:59.471
Dammit.

01:01.480 --> 01:06.156
We're getting married tomorrow.
Why aren't you excited?

01:06.240 --> 01:10.392
We've been here for an hour
and you've already said it 13 times.

01:10.480 --> 01:12.596
But we're getting married tomorrow.

01:15.200 --> 01:18.033
- Have you been working on your vows?
- Define "work."

01:18.120 --> 01:22.159
The difference between special birthday
sex and no sex on our wedding night.

01:22.240 --> 01:24.708
I do like the special birthday sex.

01:24.800 --> 01:28.076
When I asked you if you wanted
to write your vows, you said yes.

01:28.160 --> 01:31.675
I'm on top of it. This weekend
will go off without a hitch.

01:31.760 --> 01:34.593
How did it go
picking up my brother at the airport?

01:34.680 --> 01:36.955
- Sorry, what?
- How could you forget him?

01:37.040 --> 01:39.156
You have enough trouble getting along.

01:39.240 --> 01:41.151
Baby, I'm joking.

01:49.480 --> 01:52.233
Marco. The invite said "No dates."

01:54.600 --> 01:56.989
No dates.

01:57.080 --> 01:59.594
The reason I'm here is, first of all,

01:59.680 --> 02:02.114
I wanted to give you back
your skull lighter.

02:02.200 --> 02:07.035
Secondly, you always seem to have
some insight into why I'm so messed up.

02:07.120 --> 02:10.032
I chased Elliot for three years.
Now I don't want her.

02:10.120 --> 02:13.510
Maybe you idealise women, and no one
lives up to your standards.

02:13.600 --> 02:16.433
- Why would I idealise women?
- What's your mom like?

02:17.360 --> 02:20.716
I love you, honey.
You're the smartest, handsomest,

02:20.800 --> 02:24.588
sweetest boy in the whole world,
and no matter how hard you look,

02:24.680 --> 02:27.877
you will never find a woman
who will love you as much as I do.

02:27.960 --> 02:30.269
I know, Mommy.

02:30.760 --> 02:34.548
- My mom is perfect.
- Look, kid, you're just confused.

02:34.640 --> 02:37.598
Just focus on the little things
you love about her.

02:37.680 --> 02:40.717
Like the way she puts out a cigarette,

02:40.800 --> 02:43.792
or how when she finishes a beer,
she looks inside the can,

02:43.880 --> 02:46.314
just to check if there's any left.

02:46.400 --> 02:50.598
Sweetie, it's five to nine, and my
Denver omelette's not gonna make itself.

02:50.680 --> 02:53.035
It's five to nine? I gotta go.

02:53.120 --> 02:55.918
<i>He is so the Soup Nazi. Trick him.</i>

02:56.000 --> 02:59.595
What is it again? "You're out of luck
in the soup department?"

02:59.680 --> 03:02.194
- No soup for you.
- Rad.

03:04.000 --> 03:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here

03:22.040 --> 03:26.158
- What are you doing?
- Just lying here watching you sleep.

03:46.480 --> 03:50.678
<i>I don't think my hang-up has anything</i>
<i>to do with my sexy, amazing mom.</i>

03:50.760 --> 03:52.876
<i>I'm not that much of a commit-a-phobe.</i>

03:52.960 --> 03:57.158
<i>Maybe I don't feel I deserve Elliot</i>
<i>because I have low self-esteem.</i>

03:57.240 --> 04:01.518
- You have really nice hands.
- Nice? These are the hands of a god.

04:01.600 --> 04:03.989
<i>So it's not the self-esteem thing.</i>

04:04.080 --> 04:07.390
<i>Then Elliot and I got to witness</i>
<i>an event that many had spoken of</i>

04:07.480 --> 04:09.038
<i>but none had ever seen.</i>

04:09.120 --> 04:11.429
The arrival of the janitors.

04:16.959 --> 04:18.837
- Good morning.
- Is it really?

04:18.920 --> 04:21.115
No, I was kidding.

04:21.920 --> 04:25.390
I'd stay out of his way. He lost
the election for union president.

04:25.480 --> 04:27.436
Who won?

04:27.520 --> 04:29.829
Congratulations, sir.

04:29.920 --> 04:35.119
Welcome to work, boys.
Be the best janitors you can be today.

04:35.200 --> 04:38.510
- No hard feelings, bra?
- There's hard feelings.

04:41.320 --> 04:43.231
All right.

04:43.320 --> 04:46.676
What the...?
It's like a mechanical vice.

04:48.640 --> 04:50.437
Change is good.

04:52.640 --> 04:54.710
Sweetheart, I slept like a log.

04:54.800 --> 04:58.554
I didn't notice
cos I was up all night with Jack.

04:58.640 --> 05:00.517
How do you not scare him?

05:00.600 --> 05:04.912
Do you wear a nanny mask or slap on
a name tag that says, "I'm your mommy"?

05:05.000 --> 05:08.515
I refuse to be judged by a grown man
wearing a hockey jersey.

05:08.600 --> 05:12.559
Which reminds me, Jimmy's mom called
and if you guys win the big game today,

05:12.640 --> 05:14.870
she'll take everybody
to Chuck E. Cheese.

05:14.960 --> 05:19.112
I'll buy a whole new wardrobe. To pay
for it, we'll sell one of your shoes.

05:20.520 --> 05:24.832
Great. We made him cry. If we keep
this up, we're gonna scar him for life.

05:24.920 --> 05:27.798
I don't buy into all that new-agey crap.

05:27.880 --> 05:32.158
One time I saw my mom knock my father
unconscious with a frying pan.

05:32.240 --> 05:35.232
I kept right on going
with my birthday party.

05:35.320 --> 05:38.596
I am not fighting with you
anymore, ever.

05:40.080 --> 05:44.312
<i>How about this? I love that</i>
<i>you get cold when it's</i> 7 <i>1 degrees out,</i>

05:44.400 --> 05:47.039
<i>that it takes you</i> 9 <i>0 minutes</i>
<i>to order a sandwich,</i>

05:47.120 --> 05:50.874
<i>that you get a crinkle above your nose</i>
<i>when you look at me like I'm nuts,</i>

05:50.960 --> 05:54.635
<i>that after a day with you I can still</i>
<i>smell your perfume on my clothes,</i>

05:54.720 --> 05:57.280
<i>and I love that you are...</i>

05:57.360 --> 06:01.273
- Tupac, I was watching that.
- Dude, I gotta do my vows.

06:01.360 --> 06:04.079
Come on, man.
That was <i>When Har</i> ry <i>Met Sally.</i>

06:04.160 --> 06:07.072
- It was a classic.
- Yeah, dude.

06:07.160 --> 06:11.392
I was gonna rent that the other night,
but I remembered I'm a heterosexual.

06:11.480 --> 06:13.994
You couldn't remember
to go to the airport.

06:14.080 --> 06:17.117
- You told her?
- Yes, he did.

06:17.200 --> 06:20.351
If you two can stop your pe <i>tty</i> crap
for just one second,

06:20.440 --> 06:24.831
maybe we can focus on what this wedding
weekend is supposed to be about.

06:24.920 --> 06:27.480
- Love.
- No. Me.

06:27.560 --> 06:29.755
Promise me you'll get along.

06:33.520 --> 06:35.431
- Idiot.
- Tattletale.

06:41.040 --> 06:43.315
- Get out of my face.
- What?

06:43.400 --> 06:46.278
The next person to get in my face
will wish they hadn't.

06:46.360 --> 06:47.588
<i>Sociopath.</i>

06:47.680 --> 06:49.910
Catch me, stud.

06:52.200 --> 06:56.512
Most guys would've caught me.
I love that you didn't.

06:56.600 --> 06:58.591
Cool.

06:58.680 --> 07:00.750
<i>Maybe Elliot's just not the right fit.</i>

07:00.840 --> 07:04.355
- <i>I like stupid movies.</i>
- Let's rent <i>Kangaroo Jack</i> tonight.

07:04.440 --> 07:07.477
<i>I have uncontrollable hostility</i>
<i>towards small rodents.</i>

07:07.560 --> 07:11.348
- Or we could shoot rats at the dump.
- <i>Dammit. She's perfect on paper.</i>

07:11.440 --> 07:13.829
<i>What the hell's wrong with me?</i>

07:17.040 --> 07:18.951
- What?
- Nothing.

07:19.040 --> 07:22.077
I just love the way you drift off
in your head sometimes.

07:22.160 --> 07:26.199
<i>I guess the Soup Nazi was right. It is</i>
<i>the little things that are important.</i>

07:26.280 --> 07:29.431
<i>Like when Elliot</i>
<i>blows the bangs out of her face.</i>

07:29.520 --> 07:34.514
<i>Or how she's the only person I know</i>
<i>who sneezes with her eyes open.</i>

07:34.600 --> 07:37.637
<i>I realised that I really liked</i>
<i>those things about Elliot,</i>

07:37.720 --> 07:40.757
<i>but I didn't love them,</i>
<i>and I didn't love her.</i>

07:41.480 --> 07:43.391
You're the best.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.911
See you later.

07:48.960 --> 07:50.871
<i>Oh, boy.</i>

07:52.000 --> 07:55.515
Oh, my God,
that board meeting went on forever.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.592
It was so dull, I had to read pamphlets
just to stay awake.

07:58.680 --> 08:00.636
I don't have testicular cancer.

08:00.720 --> 08:04.599
Did you come across any pamphlets on
People Who Only Work Eight Days a Year

08:04.680 --> 08:07.990
and Then Spend the Other 357
Whining About It?

08:08.080 --> 08:11.709
What part of "I'm not fighting with you
anymore" do you not get?

08:11.800 --> 08:16.316
If you want someone to fight with,
you have to find someone else.

08:19.800 --> 08:23.679
Good. You're wetting
down the floor for the older folks.

08:23.760 --> 08:26.035
Please say that you're talking to me.

08:27.320 --> 08:30.676
I don't see anybody else around,
soap jockey.

08:36.200 --> 08:38.111
Chew louder.

08:39.080 --> 08:41.309
I need your help, man.
It's about Elliot.

08:41.400 --> 08:44.392
- Did you sleep with her again?
- How does everybody know?

08:44.480 --> 08:47.517
I'm not in love with her, man.
What am I supposed to do?

08:47.600 --> 08:51.309
It's killing me that I could be
hurting her. You're a very loud chewer.

08:51.400 --> 08:54.517
I'd love to help, but I'm in the middle
of writing my vows.

08:54.600 --> 08:59.879
And all I've got so far is "Let's give
it up for the caterers. Good chicken."

08:59.960 --> 09:02.428
Now you're getting married
it's all about you?

09:02.520 --> 09:06.433
Now that I'm getting married tomorrow
it's about me.

09:06.520 --> 09:09.398
Still seems like you can
take a minute for a friend.

09:09.480 --> 09:11.869
Shut up, Marco.

09:15.640 --> 09:19.189
- That was a mistake.
- You're afraid you can't take me?

09:19.280 --> 09:22.033
No. It's cos of this. Boys.

09:24.760 --> 09:28.150
- You know where to take him.
- Who's taking me where?

09:28.240 --> 09:33.268
Maintenance? I have your names now.
The maintenance brothers.

09:33.920 --> 09:36.480
That was Father Paul.
We can't read our own vows.

09:36.560 --> 09:39.757
We have to use the same Catholic ones
like everyone else.

09:42.400 --> 09:46.473
Baby, that sucks, cos
I was gonna totally blow you away.

09:46.560 --> 09:50.599
Since you guys worked so hard, read
them at the rehearsal dinner tonight.

09:50.680 --> 09:54.468
- That's a fantastic idea. Isn't it?
- Super.

09:54.560 --> 09:57.597
Awesome. I'm gonna go
work on them some more.

10:02.280 --> 10:05.113
<i>Unfortunately for me,</i>
<i>I wasn't in love with Elliot.</i>

10:05.200 --> 10:09.079
<i>But even though it was gonna be tough,</i>
<i>I knew exactly what I had to do.</i>

10:09.160 --> 10:12.914
Ready to go? I say we pick up some
Chinese and hang at home tonight.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.115
Awesome.

10:14.200 --> 10:17.431
<i>I was going to stay with her</i>
<i>for the rest of my life.</i>

10:24.400 --> 10:27.278
<i>Once you embrace a relationship</i>
<i>and decide you're in,</i>

10:27.360 --> 10:30.477
<i>everything becomes easier,</i>
<i>and I am in, baby.</i>

10:30.560 --> 10:35.315
- My parents are coming to town.
- We must eat with them.

10:35.400 --> 10:36.389
All right.

10:36.480 --> 10:40.519
Thanks for letting me crash at your
place while Carla's family's in town.

10:40.600 --> 10:42.955
It's no problem. See you, roomie.

10:45.240 --> 10:48.118
<i>And now we live together.</i>

10:50.360 --> 10:52.112
What the...?

10:52.200 --> 10:54.111
Sheila.

10:55.320 --> 10:59.199
I assume you're saying "Let me out
or I'll kill you." Not gonna happen.

10:59.280 --> 11:02.033
I'm in a rare position of power here.

11:02.120 --> 11:05.351
I'm only gonna let you out
if you admit that you're my mentor.

11:05.960 --> 11:08.997
I know that makes you angry, but...

11:11.280 --> 11:13.999
I'm fine with whatever you wanna do.

11:17.840 --> 11:20.673
- Why is your mouth red?
- Duct tape, morgue drawer.

11:20.760 --> 11:23.274
Don't piss off the janitor.
End of story.

11:23.360 --> 11:27.273
I'm ordering more pens. Do you like
twisty bottoms or clicky tops?

11:27.360 --> 11:29.715
I can't imagine anything
I care less about.

11:29.800 --> 11:32.598
Damn these twisty bottoms.
We need more clicky tops.

11:32.680 --> 11:36.389
Not gonna happen. I just told Carla
to order 100,000 twisty bottoms.

11:36.480 --> 11:39.870
Nice face. But can't you just order
a box of clicky tops for me?

11:39.960 --> 11:43.794
- No, everybody gets the same.
- Fine. I'll just take these.

11:45.520 --> 11:49.035
You just bought yourself
four weekends on call.

11:49.800 --> 11:51.756
Damn twisty bottoms.

11:51.840 --> 11:54.479
You said you didn't care.
Why are you fighting?

11:54.560 --> 11:56.471
I can't stop.

11:58.400 --> 12:02.109
Baby, you mean so much to me.
That's why you my baby.

12:02.200 --> 12:05.829
There were babies before you,
but I promise you, baby,

12:05.920 --> 12:09.151
you will be my baby forever, baby.

12:09.240 --> 12:11.800
Stop saying "baby."

12:12.280 --> 12:16.034
You're not even dressed yet?
We gotta pick up Carla on the way, man.

12:16.120 --> 12:19.908
Tell her I couldn't come up with
anything, so I guess I don't love her.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.309
- Give me that.
- For what?

12:22.400 --> 12:24.789
I'm gonna write your vows for you.

12:25.800 --> 12:28.473
- A clicky top.
- Does this mean we're amigos?

12:28.560 --> 12:32.314
No, I love my sister and she deserves
to hear something beautiful.

12:32.400 --> 12:36.075
If your life was on the line you
couldn't squeeze one eloquent thought

12:36.160 --> 12:38.276
out of that tetherball you call a head.

12:38.360 --> 12:40.112
Thank you.

12:42.880 --> 12:46.668
God, I can't remember the last time
I saw you in this suit and tie.

12:46.760 --> 12:50.230
- How can you not remember those...
- Oh, God, the two guys.

12:50.320 --> 12:52.470
Their mom was trying to sing that song.

12:52.560 --> 12:54.790
That was so funny.

12:56.960 --> 13:00.475
Until we had to put their horse down.

13:00.560 --> 13:02.312
Poor Cinnamon.

13:02.400 --> 13:06.473
He could run like the wind
but his tail couldn't put out that fire.

13:06.560 --> 13:09.074
God, we have so much history together.

13:09.160 --> 13:12.311
It's so great to finally
be able to call you my boyfriend.

13:12.400 --> 13:15.710
- Boyfriend?
- Should I not have said that?

13:15.800 --> 13:18.189
No, it's just nice to hear it out loud.

13:18.840 --> 13:22.833
<i>And it was nice. Here I was, having</i>
<i>my tie tied by this beautiful woman</i>

13:22.920 --> 13:25.195
<i>who happened to be</i>
<i>one of my closest friends</i>

13:25.280 --> 13:28.829
<i>and I realised this is what</i>
<i>a relationship is supposed to feel like.</i>

13:28.920 --> 13:31.480
There, it's perfect.

13:31.560 --> 13:33.471
It is.

13:40.880 --> 13:44.190
- What's going on with you?
- Jordan and I aren't...

13:45.720 --> 13:49.793
- We're not fighting anymore.
- How long has this been going on?

13:49.880 --> 13:53.031
Since the baby came along
we've been fighting less and less.

13:53.120 --> 13:56.795
Why don't you get a hotel room,
pour some nice champagne, get in a tub,

13:56.880 --> 13:59.792
and rip each other new ones,
make it special.

13:59.880 --> 14:03.111
- She won't go for that.
- You have to do something.

14:03.200 --> 14:05.760
No, I don't, you jackass.

14:06.720 --> 14:09.075
Sweetie, I'm getting married tomorrow.

14:09.160 --> 14:11.071
Please?

14:15.600 --> 14:20.355
And most of all,
I wish our mom was with us tonight.

14:21.960 --> 14:24.793
Not because she was taken too early,

14:24.880 --> 14:27.758
but because she would see
how happy you've made me

14:27.840 --> 14:30.070
and she would love you forever for that.

14:31.240 --> 14:33.435
And Christopher?

14:33.520 --> 14:37.149
I've made mistakes in my life,
but you've managed to erase them all,

14:37.240 --> 14:41.313
because each and every one of them
has led me to you.

14:44.680 --> 14:47.274
That's a hard act to follow.

14:52.480 --> 14:55.472
I love that you get cold
when it's 71 degrees out,

14:55.560 --> 14:59.473
I love that it takes you
an hour and a half to order a sandwich,

14:59.560 --> 15:03.189
that you get a crinkle over your nose
when you look at me like I'm nuts.

15:03.280 --> 15:06.272
Like you got right now.
Just like that one.

15:06.360 --> 15:10.148
I love that you're the last person
I wanna talk to before I go to sleep.

15:11.400 --> 15:13.675
Dude, I'm working here.

15:14.880 --> 15:18.919
It's not because I'm Ionely, and it's
not because it's our rehearsal dinner.

15:19.000 --> 15:23.949
When you realise you wanna spend
the rest of your life with someone,

15:24.040 --> 15:27.157
you want the rest of your life
to start as soon as possible.

15:33.840 --> 15:35.956
- Turk?
- Yeah, baby?

15:36.040 --> 15:38.600
That's the speech from
<i>When Har</i> ry <i>Met Sally.</i>

15:44.760 --> 15:47.194
- Those pants make your ass look giant.
- Stop.

15:47.280 --> 15:50.113
- It's for us. You suck at Scrabble.
- Do I look mad?

15:50.200 --> 15:53.749
You have so much Botox in your
expressionless face I can't tell.

15:53.840 --> 15:57.276
- Is that a frown?
- What else you got?

15:57.360 --> 16:01.353
When it's my turn to listen to the baby
monitor, when you sleep, I turn it off.

16:01.440 --> 16:04.477
Give it up.
There's nothing you can say.

16:06.600 --> 16:09.478
You and your mother
are basically the same person.

16:11.800 --> 16:14.917
What did you say? I will kill you.

16:15.000 --> 16:17.514
You don't wanna fight
in front of Jack anymore,

16:17.600 --> 16:20.910
but I don't think that means
we gotta stop all together.

16:21.000 --> 16:23.560
You are an unpredictable,
passionate person

16:23.640 --> 16:26.313
and you challenge me each and every day.

16:26.400 --> 16:30.154
That's the reason I can imagine being
with you when I'm 70 and you're <i>6</i> 5,

16:30.240 --> 16:32.629
and your face is 40
and your boobs are 29.

16:32.720 --> 16:35.314
- My face'll never look 40.
- You're right. My bad.

16:38.760 --> 16:42.389
Oh, my God, my future brother-in-law
is an evil genius.

16:42.480 --> 16:45.711
I'm gonna go check on Sally.

16:45.800 --> 16:47.711
Not funny yet.

16:50.720 --> 16:54.713
- You haven't broken up with her yet.
- I've decided to stay with her forever.

16:54.800 --> 16:59.715
I'm sure Elliot doesn't wanna spend her
life with someone who doesn't love her.

16:59.800 --> 17:03.475
If it's OK with you, I'm gonna take
my relationship advice

17:03.560 --> 17:06.915
from someone whose fiancée
is currently speaking to him.

17:07.000 --> 17:10.515
Give me some champagne.
I need a victory sip.

17:10.599 --> 17:13.910
Cheers. You're making a big mistake.

17:14.000 --> 17:16.116
Elliot and I are like best friends.

17:16.200 --> 17:19.157
We love hanging out with each other.
Maybe that's love.

17:19.240 --> 17:22.516
- Who knows what love really is?
- I do.

17:22.599 --> 17:28.071
When I look at Carla, I see the future.
I see kids. I see minivans.

17:28.160 --> 17:31.436
- I see a beer gut. On me, not her.
- I hope so.

17:31.520 --> 17:36.310
But you know what's really weird? None
of that stuff scares me, not even...

17:36.400 --> 17:41.554
- Dude, I'm trying to make a point here.
- You should stand up and say that.

17:43.440 --> 17:47.228
When I look into your eyes,
I see the future.

17:48.880 --> 17:52.998
I see kids. I see minivans.

17:53.080 --> 17:54.991
You name it, I see it.

17:55.080 --> 17:57.958
The weird thing is, though,

17:58.960 --> 18:02.077
as long as I see your smile,
none of that stuff scares me.

18:02.160 --> 18:05.391
<i>Listening to Turk</i>
<i>made me think a lot about love.</i>

18:08.400 --> 18:10.630
<i>Sometimes it can be hard to understand.</i>

18:10.720 --> 18:12.995
Why not say you felt that way, dumb ass?

18:13.080 --> 18:17.278
You're so much like your mother
you wouldn't have listened anyway.

18:23.240 --> 18:25.674
- No biting.
- Just take it, you girl.

18:27.360 --> 18:29.157
<i>Other times, love's obvious.</i>

18:29.240 --> 18:36.635
Anyway, I may not ever be able
to tell you how much you mean to me,

18:36.720 --> 18:40.633
but I promise I will try to show you

18:40.720 --> 18:43.075
for the rest of my life.

18:43.840 --> 18:45.751
I love you.

18:48.680 --> 18:51.797
Aren't they amazing?

18:51.880 --> 18:53.791
I don't love you.

18:54.960 --> 18:57.315
What?

18:57.400 --> 19:00.517
- Please don't cry.
- I won't.

19:07.480 --> 19:10.233
Oh, God, someone call 911.

19:10.320 --> 19:12.470
Can I get a little more wine, please?

19:17.080 --> 19:19.469
This chicken is fantastic.
