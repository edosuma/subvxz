WEBVTT

00:19.060 --> 00:20.729
<i>Prisoners of the Pykes!</i>

00:20.812 --> 00:23.398
<i>Ahsoka Tano has teamed up
with the Martez Sisters</i>

00:23.481 --> 00:26.401
<i>who live in the underworld
of the city planet Coruscant.</i>

00:26.818 --> 00:29.654
<i>Struggling to make ends meet,
Rafa Martez scored a job</i>

00:29.738 --> 00:32.448
<i>running a spice shipment
from the planet Kessel.</i>

00:32.782 --> 00:36.703
<i>Tempers flare when Ahsoka realized
the spice was being sold to the Pykes,</i>

00:36.786 --> 00:38.997
<i>a powerful crime syndicate.</i>

00:39.080 --> 00:42.459
<i>As Ahsoka and Rafa argued,
Trace Martez dumped the spice,</i>

00:42.542 --> 00:44.127
<i>hoping to end the dispute.</i>

00:44.627 --> 00:49.841
<i>With no shipment to deliver, the three
attempted to deceive the Pykes and failed.</i>

00:49.924 --> 00:51.343
<i>We now find them imprisoned</i>

00:51.426 --> 00:54.804
<i>deep within a fortress
on the planet Oba Diah.</i>

01:03.646 --> 01:06.483
I never figured when I took
my ship out for the first time

01:06.566 --> 01:08.401
I'd wind up in a place like this.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.987
Hey, you dumped the spice.

01:11.279 --> 01:14.657
We wouldn't be here if you hadn't
taken the job with the Pykes.

01:15.033 --> 01:19.913
Fact, if she doesn't dump the spice,
we finish our job, and we're already gone.

01:20.288 --> 01:24.793
Fact, the Pykes turned spice
into something that ruins lives.

01:24.876 --> 01:27.754
So, those lives would be on you!
Says who?

01:27.837 --> 01:32.008
That's just the way it is. You can't
profit from other people's suffering.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.593
Or at least, I won't let you.

01:33.677 --> 01:38.056
Will you listen to this?
We got a regular Jedi here.

01:39.140 --> 01:40.183
What if I was?

01:41.101 --> 01:42.185
Don't kid around.

01:42.811 --> 01:46.064
You didn't tell her, did you?
Tell me what?

01:46.147 --> 01:49.442
About why Trace and I
keep our distance from the Jedi,

01:49.526 --> 01:51.152
or any Topsiders for that matter.

01:51.236 --> 01:52.696
Oh, shut up, Rafa.

01:53.238 --> 01:54.280
I don't think so,

01:54.364 --> 01:57.867
not if Miss "High Ideals" here
is gonna lecture me about morality.

02:00.161 --> 02:01.579
A couple of years ago,

02:01.663 --> 02:05.208
there was a prison break on the surface
of Coruscant, where you live,

02:05.959 --> 02:08.044
some gangster named Ziro.

02:09.336 --> 02:11.006
Then came the Jedi.

02:11.089 --> 02:16.052
We watched, like so many others, as they
chased Ziro and his gang down the portal,

02:16.136 --> 02:19.097
leaping from speeder to speeder
as they went.

02:19.180 --> 02:22.559
Finally, some red-eyed alien
protecting Ziro

02:22.642 --> 02:26.354
blasted the engine
of an ascending cargo transport.

02:27.147 --> 02:29.774
The ship went
spiraling out of control.

02:29.858 --> 02:33.361
The Jedi went into action,
tried to gain control of the ship.

02:33.903 --> 02:37.741
There was a populated landing platform
right in the path of the ship,

02:37.824 --> 02:41.828
but the Jedi steered it clear of that,
right into the portal wall.

02:42.370 --> 02:45.457
And on the other side of that wall
was our home.

02:46.624 --> 02:50.128
Mom and Dad saw it coming.
They got Rafa and I out.

02:51.087 --> 02:52.464
But they weren't so lucky.

02:53.214 --> 02:55.050
The Jedi didn't even capture Ziro.

02:55.133 --> 02:58.178
The "distraction" of the ship
helped him get away.

03:00.722 --> 03:04.642
Afterward, the Jedi came back,
and one of them came over to me.

03:05.810 --> 03:07.354
I'll never forget it.

03:07.437 --> 03:12.525
She was beautiful, dark robes
contrasting against her light green skin.

03:12.609 --> 03:14.361
Penetrating eyes.

03:14.444 --> 03:17.989
She looked at me,
and you know what she said?

03:22.118 --> 03:27.165
She said, "I had to make a choice,
but not to worry,

03:27.248 --> 03:29.876
the Force will be with you."

03:29.959 --> 03:33.171
That's it. Then she was off.

03:33.254 --> 03:37.175
And Trace and I were left without parents,
without a home,

03:37.258 --> 03:40.553
just left there
to find our way in their system.

03:44.808 --> 03:48.395
I've spent every day since
building a new life for me and Trace,

03:48.728 --> 03:54.150
and it's about us not depending on Jedi
or these criminals or anyone else.

03:54.234 --> 03:58.071
We make our own rules,
and we survive just fine!

03:58.697 --> 04:00.907
That is, until Trace
let you tag along.

04:02.909 --> 04:04.077
I'm so sorry.

04:05.745 --> 04:06.746
Martez.

04:11.334 --> 04:13.211
Martez, come with us.

04:13.586 --> 04:14.671
Which one?

04:15.213 --> 04:16.214
Rafa.

04:16.297 --> 04:17.423
You're not touching her.

04:17.841 --> 04:20.260
Yeah, she's right. Take her instead.

04:26.725 --> 04:27.892
Would you...

04:27.976 --> 04:31.187
Trace, if I die,
you get the family business!

04:31.730 --> 04:34.065
But I don't want the family business!

04:34.149 --> 04:35.442
Well, it's yours anyway!

04:36.317 --> 04:39.320
But you're not gonna die!
I'll figure something out!

04:39.404 --> 04:40.530
Figure it out quickly!

04:50.915 --> 04:55.587
Hey, uh, if you want to know the truth,
uh, pain really doesn't help me focus.

04:55.670 --> 04:58.465
Talking?
Now, talking is always a good thing.

05:01.092 --> 05:04.471
Look, now that I think about it,

05:04.554 --> 05:07.724
I think the people on
Kessel scammed us.

05:23.031 --> 05:26.785
You know, Rafa is telling the truth.

05:26.868 --> 05:31.164
Since that day, it's really been
us versus everyone else,

05:31.247 --> 05:32.457
until you showed up.

05:33.333 --> 05:34.918
So, why'd you bother with me?

05:37.545 --> 05:39.339
It's something my
mother would've done.

05:40.173 --> 05:43.051
She always believed
in helping others.

05:43.134 --> 05:47.514
This life I have,
it's not how I was raised.

05:47.597 --> 05:48.765
It's how it is.

05:54.813 --> 05:57.023
What did you do to her? 
Answer me!

05:57.107 --> 05:58.983
Don't make them mad, Trace.

05:59.067 --> 06:02.654
How about they don't make me mad
and tell me what they did to my sister!

06:05.031 --> 06:07.075
Let her go!

06:08.493 --> 06:10.537
Make sure Rafa's okay!

06:11.204 --> 06:12.205
Trace!

06:29.055 --> 06:31.433
Where is the spice?

06:31.516 --> 06:34.894
Okay, look.
I'll tell you where the spice is.

06:34.978 --> 06:37.230
I just didn't want my friends
to hear me tell you.

07:12.682 --> 07:15.810
Okay, I'm gonna get one shot at this.

07:24.861 --> 07:25.861
Rafa.

07:26.488 --> 07:28.448
I don't know where the spice is!

07:28.531 --> 07:31.326
Hey. Hey. It's all right.

07:32.077 --> 07:33.119
Where's Trace?

07:33.203 --> 07:36.498
They took her, but
listen, we have to go.

07:36.581 --> 07:37.582
Now!

07:38.875 --> 07:40.085
How'd you do that?

07:40.168 --> 07:41.169
It wasn't me.

07:41.252 --> 07:44.673
I think there was a power outage,
and the energy field turned off.

07:44.756 --> 07:46.299
About time we caught a break.

07:46.633 --> 07:47.801
Let's go get Trace.

08:09.698 --> 08:10.865
Hey, let us out!

08:13.952 --> 08:14.994
Hey!

08:33.596 --> 08:34.597
Ah!

08:37.475 --> 08:40.145
Are you crazy? I could have shot you!

08:40.227 --> 08:43.815
You gotta be kidding me.
We came to rescue you!

08:43.898 --> 08:47.318
No, I was on my way
to break you two out!

08:48.945 --> 08:50.739
This way!
No, this way!

08:51.031 --> 08:52.657
Tiebreaker, come on!

09:52.008 --> 09:53.510
Trace, it's too late!

09:54.094 --> 09:55.261
I'll take my chances.

10:01.184 --> 10:02.185
Ah!

10:02.560 --> 10:05.397
Uh, Trace! Careful!

10:06.106 --> 10:09.776
You see that? Come on, Ahsoka!

10:09.859 --> 10:13.988
If you can't make it, Ahsoka,
we'll be back for you!

10:14.072 --> 10:16.157
Let's get outta here. 
She won't make it.

10:17.450 --> 10:18.993
We can't just leave her!

10:21.496 --> 10:22.872
Wait, where'd she go?

10:22.956 --> 10:25.125
She didn't make it.
That's terrible.

10:25.208 --> 10:26.584
Ahsoka!

10:27.335 --> 10:28.336
I'm here.

10:28.712 --> 10:31.506
How'd you do that?
I'm more athletic than I look.

10:31.589 --> 10:33.776
That's not normal.
We don't have time to discuss this.

10:33.800 --> 10:34.801
Let's go!

10:50.567 --> 10:52.527
Finally. There's our way out.

11:17.427 --> 11:20.430
All of this effort to kill us is crazy.

11:20.513 --> 11:23.516
You'd think these Pykes
have never pulled a fast one

11:23.600 --> 11:25.602
or had a fast one pulled on them.

11:25.935 --> 11:28.772
This is what happens
when you get into business with criminals.

11:29.189 --> 11:30.940
When you're trying to make a living,

11:31.024 --> 11:35.153
you don't really think of the possible
torture or execution part of the deal.

11:35.487 --> 11:37.864
The Pykes aren't gonna let us
get off this planet.

11:37.947 --> 11:39.908
Their reputation is at stake.

11:40.408 --> 11:42.827
Fine. Ahsoka, you seem resourceful.

11:42.911 --> 11:46.039
You go disable the gates
while Trace and I distract the guards.

11:46.122 --> 11:49.292
That must mean you think
disabling the gate is the difficult part.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.048
Looks like you two
are getting along better.

11:55.423 --> 11:58.677
Yeah, well, looks can be deceiving.
Come on.

13:05.744 --> 13:07.704
Looks like they're in trouble again.

13:33.271 --> 13:34.271
Nice shot.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.024
Hey, come on.

13:51.790 --> 13:54.709
I don't believe it. I think I see my ship!

13:56.419 --> 14:00.674
You might be cut out for this life,
but I'm not sure about Trace.

14:01.091 --> 14:05.345
If she doesn't wanna be involved
with the jobs I do, she can say so.

14:05.428 --> 14:06.805
Do you think she'd say no to you?

14:14.145 --> 14:15.897
You're her sister.

14:15.980 --> 14:18.775
She'd never think you don't have
her best interests at heart.

14:19.651 --> 14:22.570
What do you want?
What's in this for you?

14:23.238 --> 14:27.701
Hey, got any credits?
I need something to eat.

14:27.784 --> 14:29.536
Do I look like I have credits?

14:29.619 --> 14:32.247
Well, if you didn't, I wouldn't be asking.

14:32.539 --> 14:34.541
We're busy right now. Get out of here.

14:34.833 --> 14:36.000
Come on. Let's go.

14:41.923 --> 14:43.258
You never answered my question.

14:44.092 --> 14:45.719
In my life,

14:45.802 --> 14:50.390
when you find people who need your help,
you help them, no matter what.

14:51.307 --> 14:52.851
I guess it's just who I am.

14:53.768 --> 14:55.729
I knew someone who used to talk like you.

14:56.521 --> 14:58.565
Yeah, Trace told me.

14:59.607 --> 15:01.860
I'm just trying to do what's best.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.827
Hey, you guys got any credits?

15:11.661 --> 15:13.329
No, get out of here.

15:13.997 --> 15:14.997
Wait.

15:15.999 --> 15:17.500
Are you looking for them?

15:18.668 --> 15:19.878
Have you seen them?

15:20.545 --> 15:22.297
What's it worth to you?

15:30.305 --> 15:31.389
There she is.

15:31.473 --> 15:34.267
The <i>Angel</i> is parked
on one of the landing platforms.

15:34.351 --> 15:36.770
All we have to do is
find a way up there.

15:36.853 --> 15:38.855
Forget about your ship.

15:38.938 --> 15:42.359
Let's take the first thing we can find
and get off this rock.

15:42.442 --> 15:45.737
No! I just finished
putting the <i>Silver Angel</i> together.

15:45.820 --> 15:48.114
And if you're smart,
you'd wanna live to build another

15:48.198 --> 15:50.533
instead of dying
to get the one you've got.

15:50.825 --> 15:53.703
If we leave my ship behind,
you're buying me a new one.

15:53.787 --> 15:56.247
As long as I'm alive to fund one,
I'm good.

15:58.875 --> 16:00.210
There they are.

16:03.046 --> 16:04.046
Run.

16:22.816 --> 16:23.816
Hey!

16:26.861 --> 16:28.279
The speeder. There!

17:08.819 --> 17:09.863
What do you think?

17:10.739 --> 17:14.367
I'm not sure.
It could be the Jedi I met on Carlac.

17:14.451 --> 17:17.454
But if it is her, what
is she doing here?

17:18.121 --> 17:21.040
Her presence could
compromise our mission.

17:21.332 --> 17:25.337
Perhaps,
but don't forget we have a common enemy.

17:25.420 --> 17:28.006
Let's keep track of her.
She could be of use to us.

17:40.894 --> 17:44.522
<i>You cost me thousands of credits.</i>

17:44.606 --> 17:47.525
<i>And then you tried to cheat me.</i>

17:47.942 --> 17:52.197
<i>Did you honestly think
you'd get away with fooling a Pyke?</i>

17:52.447 --> 17:56.534
Well, uh, I mean, we wouldn't have tried
if we didn't think...

17:56.618 --> 18:00.246
<i>Silence!</i>
Kill them. And let's move on.

18:00.663 --> 18:02.665
I thought you wanted to know
where the spice was?

18:03.958 --> 18:07.337
<i>Your little friend is still in the city.</i>

18:07.420 --> 18:12.801
<i>When we find her, I'll torture her
and find out everything we need to know.</i>

18:36.282 --> 18:39.536
<i>Now, execute them and be done with it.</i>

18:40.120 --> 18:42.455
This is not the way I
saw this job ending.

18:47.335 --> 18:48.336
Ahsoka!

19:14.112 --> 19:16.072
We're clear. Let's go, Rafa.

19:16.156 --> 19:17.490
I've had enough of this planet.

19:28.209 --> 19:32.088
I knew keeping them in the open
would draw you out.

19:47.062 --> 19:50.732
Listen. I think there's a way
we can work this out.

19:50.815 --> 19:54.903
How about we do a job
for the great Marg Krim?

19:55.320 --> 19:58.782
You didn't get it right
the first time, Martez.

19:58.865 --> 20:01.534
Why would I waste
any more time with you?

20:01.618 --> 20:04.454
What? You planning
on torturing us again?

20:04.829 --> 20:07.290
Until you give me my spice.

20:15.131 --> 20:18.218
Guys, I'm sorry.

20:18.301 --> 20:20.845
I know, I never should
have taken this job.

20:25.433 --> 20:27.268
We live and learn, Rafa.

20:28.812 --> 20:31.189
Yeah, but for how much longer?
