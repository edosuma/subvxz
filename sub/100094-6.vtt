Eat your breakfast.
We have to leave in a few minutes.

01:18.703 --> 01:20.163
I saw something last night.

01:21.081 --> 01:21.956
In the rain.

01:23.124 --> 01:23.958
Your dad?

01:24.042 --> 01:24.876
No.

01:26.419 --> 01:27.462
You saw Dad?

01:27.962 --> 01:28.838
Um...

01:29.255 --> 01:31.758
For a second, I really thought I did.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.927
It's probably just wishful thinking.

Are you sad?

You know what?

01:53.530 --> 01:54.364
Yeah.

01:55.115 --> 01:56.074
Yeah, I'm a little sad.

01:56.658 --> 01:58.660
You know, yesterday was a really big day,

01:58.743 --> 02:01.329
and I couldn't help
but think of your father.

02:01.412 --> 02:02.622
And sometimes people get sad,

02:02.705 --> 02:03.706
and that's okay.

02:05.166 --> 02:07.335
Hey, but what did you see
in... in the rain?

02:08.503 --> 02:09.379
I don't know.

02:11.005 --> 02:12.966
-You wanted to show me something?
-Huh?

Is she, like, your girlfriend now?

03:10.023 --> 03:11.733
She's my friend. Grow up, Jonathan.

Don't make it weird.

I'm not gonna make it weird.

03:19.532 --> 03:21.242
But that was awesome.

03:21.618 --> 03:27.457
You just walked right up to them and said,
"Esperanza's cooler than you, Jonathan."

03:27.540 --> 03:28.458
[sighs]

03:28.541 --> 03:29.500
I made it weird.

03:30.335 --> 03:32.462
I saw something last night, in the storm.

03:32.545 --> 03:33.796
I didn't see a storm.

03:33.880 --> 03:36.257
Well, it was there,
and inside it was a man made of lightning,

03:36.341 --> 03:39.552
and he had long arms,
and he was crooked-looking,

03:39.636 --> 03:41.054
so I named him "The Crooked Man."

03:41.137 --> 03:42.555
Why not Electric Man?

03:42.639 --> 03:43.973
He was crooked. Duh.

03:44.432 --> 03:46.017
He came right up to my window

03:46.100 --> 03:47.143
and looked right at me.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.478
He had eyes?

03:49.103 --> 03:52.315
Not really, but it was like he wanted
something from me, but I don't know what.

03:52.398 --> 03:53.483
Did you tell your mom?

03:53.858 --> 03:56.069
She was looking at a video of my dad
this morning.

03:57.195 --> 03:58.988
We should handle this ourselves.

until we know what we're dealing with.

ordered some online for me.

-Okay.
-I think there's too much blank space.

of Alvin Ailey's work.

I would overlay, like, a grid,

between Ailey's work and ours.

you remember about him.

and, poof, it was gone.

Uh-huh.

Maybe they can also make storms.

07:49.802 --> 07:51.512
You took their hermit crab.

07:51.596 --> 07:54.765
Maybe they sent the storm to get it back.

But my dad worked for BIONA. He...
He wouldn't work for bad people.

15:21.754 --> 15:24.006
and tell me if this is what you saw
outside your window.

15:27.343 --> 15:29.178
[low rumbling]

15:30.679 --> 15:32.806
[dialing]

15:39.813 --> 15:41.649
Hi, Charlotte, um...

15:42.316 --> 15:43.359
It's Nicole Warren.

15:43.442 --> 15:45.861
Look, I need to see you right away.
It's very urgent.

15:45.945 --> 15:49.281
Uh, 9821 Clairemont Avenue, Apartment 9,
Decatur.

15:49.365 --> 15:51.867
Um, call me back.
Just please call me back right away.

15:51.951 --> 15:52.785
Thank you.

15:54.954 --> 15:55.955
[Suzanne] Follow me.

15:58.666 --> 15:59.500
What's going on?

16:00.042 --> 16:03.545
I know you haven't told us everything
you know about the Iceland event.

16:04.421 --> 16:06.048
-What?
-And why should you?

16:06.590 --> 16:10.260
You want ownership over your research
as a scientist.

16:10.761 --> 16:11.762
You were there.

16:11.845 --> 16:16.183
We would be foolish not to avail ourselves
of your perspective.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.686
I'm sorry, what-- So, what is happening?

16:19.019 --> 16:20.646
We're approving your research proposal

16:20.729 --> 16:22.940
and granting you access to the L5 labs.

16:24.233 --> 16:26.193
You're a-approving my...

16:26.276 --> 16:28.612
Uh, that... Well, this is great.

16:28.946 --> 16:30.781
Thank you. That'll be all, Lars.

16:30.864 --> 16:33.033
[cell phone ringing]

16:33.492 --> 16:34.326
Um...

16:35.327 --> 16:37.621
So, all that talk about bandwidth
and, uh...

16:38.831 --> 16:40.624
not needing an engineer was, uh...

16:41.083 --> 16:43.335
-Are you trying to talk me out of this?
-No.

16:44.586 --> 16:45.421
No.

16:46.463 --> 16:47.297
Thank you.

16:48.549 --> 16:49.425
[beeps]

16:50.676 --> 16:52.511
Welcome to your new workspace.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.056
[sheep bleating]

16:59.852 --> 17:00.936
[sheep bleating]

17:01.020 --> 17:03.856
Here, you'll find flora and fauna
from the aurora event.

17:04.857 --> 17:08.694
So, y-you've been investigating
Iceland specimens all these years?

17:08.777 --> 17:09.695
No.

17:09.778 --> 17:10.779
-Oh.
-A few years ago,

17:10.863 --> 17:13.907
Mark proposed a new project
to build on his initial findings.

17:14.616 --> 17:15.451
Oh.

17:16.035 --> 17:16.994
He never told me.

17:17.077 --> 17:18.662
He asked to keep it confidential.

17:18.746 --> 17:19.747
[sheep bleating]

17:19.830 --> 17:22.666
We were awaiting his results
when he suddenly passed away.

17:23.876 --> 17:26.170
We searched his computer for the files,

17:26.795 --> 17:29.256
but Mark either buried his findings or...

17:30.007 --> 17:33.302
-someone else wiped his files clean.
-[sheep bleating]

17:33.635 --> 17:34.470
Well...

17:34.553 --> 17:38.849
But if you can't find Mark's research,
why keep his study alive?

17:39.224 --> 17:41.018
A few months ago,
the University of Iceland

17:41.101 --> 17:42.770
was doing research in the area

17:42.853 --> 17:45.647
and reported sightings of mutated animals,

17:46.065 --> 17:49.318
peculiar phenomena
possibly tied to the aurora event.

17:49.985 --> 17:52.237
What... What kind of phenomena?

17:52.863 --> 17:54.740
The best we can tell
is that the animals there

17:54.823 --> 17:57.534
are being hit
with some sort of radiation poisoning.

17:57.993 --> 18:01.205
The infected animals manifest lesions
on their bodies

18:01.538 --> 18:03.373
and die within a matter of months.

18:03.832 --> 18:08.295
But this fox seems to have been cured
in the past few days

18:08.837 --> 18:10.881
without any medical intervention
whatsoever.

18:12.049 --> 18:13.675
[stammers] It's cured?

18:14.093 --> 18:16.303
We can find no evidence
of the prior disease.

18:17.096 --> 18:18.889
He was sick the day of the blackout.

18:18.972 --> 18:19.973
Now he's not.

18:22.101 --> 18:22.935
Hm.

18:24.269 --> 18:27.648
You asked why I changed my mind
about having you join this project.

18:27.731 --> 18:28.941
[whining]

18:29.024 --> 18:29.900
Here's why.

18:36.490 --> 18:38.826
-What am I looking at?
-Aerial footage of the forest

18:38.909 --> 18:41.286
where you and Mark
witnessed the aurora event.

18:42.287 --> 18:45.791
Whatever was inside this clearing
protected the ground.

18:45.874 --> 18:47.876
The rest looks like it was burned.

18:48.252 --> 18:51.672
It's necrosis.
The area's decaying and collapsing.

18:51.755 --> 18:53.841
Those fingers aren't burns.

18:54.633 --> 18:56.385
They're deep scars in the earth,

18:57.010 --> 18:58.137
and they're spreading.

18:59.012 --> 18:59.847
What?

19:01.682 --> 19:03.600
The fox was found here.

19:04.977 --> 19:08.856
So whatever is happening to the land
affected the fox.

19:08.939 --> 19:12.192
But now the fox
looks like it came from the healthy area.

19:12.734 --> 19:16.989
Whatever reversed the necrosis in the fox
could stop the damage to the ground.

19:17.406 --> 19:18.532
We have to figure this out

19:18.615 --> 19:20.826
before it devours all of Iceland.

19:23.287 --> 19:25.789
-[inhales deeply]
-You need to tell us what you know.

19:30.878 --> 19:32.087
[knocking]

19:56.486 --> 19:57.321
[lock clicks]

20:01.533 --> 20:03.035
[floorboards creaking]

20:05.954 --> 20:06.830
Charlotte?

20:08.040 --> 20:09.416
Charlotte, are you in here?

20:10.125 --> 20:11.251
[floorboard creaks]

20:11.335 --> 20:12.920
Dion's in trouble. Look.

20:14.338 --> 20:16.048
Does this look familiar?

20:17.466 --> 20:20.510
This-- This was the thing
that was in the video.

20:20.594 --> 20:22.554
It was the thing that took Mark, and...

20:23.013 --> 20:25.807
and it was outside Dion's bedroom window
last night, okay?

20:25.891 --> 20:27.976
You're the only one
who's faced it and survived.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.353
I don't know what to do,

20:29.436 --> 20:32.898
so if you could just, please, please,
tell me what to... what to do...

20:34.316 --> 20:36.443
There's nothing you can do.

20:37.861 --> 20:39.196
It's too powerful.

20:41.740 --> 20:43.700
Dion just needs a teacher, okay?

20:43.784 --> 20:44.701
You lived.

20:44.785 --> 20:46.662
You make it sound like I have a life.

20:46.870 --> 20:48.413
I survived. That's all.

20:48.497 --> 20:50.415
Well, teach Dion how to survive.

20:51.541 --> 20:52.834
You want your child to disappear?

20:53.210 --> 20:55.671
No contact with friends.
No contact with family.

20:55.754 --> 20:57.214
Is that what you want for your child?

20:57.839 --> 20:58.840
No.

21:00.175 --> 21:03.303
-But this thing is after him.
-Well, it's after me, too.

21:03.387 --> 21:05.973
And I did not get this far
by being reckless.

21:07.266 --> 21:08.433
I'm sorry I can't help you.

21:08.517 --> 21:11.979
Oh. Please, hey. Just don't leave, okay?
What if you just met my son?

21:12.062 --> 21:14.189
-[scoffs]
-He's eight years old. He...

21:14.815 --> 21:17.776
He still plays with Legos,
and he loves Cheez Doodles,

21:17.859 --> 21:18.777
and he's smart,

21:18.860 --> 21:20.737
and he loves science,
just like his father,

21:20.821 --> 21:22.406
and this thing took his father.

21:22.489 --> 21:26.201
I don't know how to help him, Charlotte.
He deserves a fighting chance.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.078
Don't let this thing kill my son!

21:37.587 --> 21:39.131
[Charlotte sighs] All right.

21:44.052 --> 21:44.886
I'll try.

21:46.179 --> 21:51.518
Once. But if you talk to anybody about me,
I am gone forever.

21:53.729 --> 21:54.855
Thank you.

21:56.106 --> 21:57.816
-[sighs]
-Oh, God.

21:59.151 --> 22:00.277
Thank you.

22:03.947 --> 22:05.198
Hey, I want you to meet someone,

22:05.282 --> 22:08.285
but you have to promise
to keep it a secret.

22:08.368 --> 22:09.619
You can't tell anybody.

22:09.703 --> 22:10.704
Not Esperanza.

22:10.787 --> 22:12.414
Not Pat.
Do you understand me?

22:15.125 --> 22:15.959
Okay.

22:16.752 --> 22:17.669
Hey.

22:18.754 --> 22:19.713
Charlotte Tuck.

22:20.547 --> 22:22.132
The woman that my dad saved?

22:22.841 --> 22:24.176
And you're invisible?

22:24.259 --> 22:25.677
This is so cool!

22:25.761 --> 22:28.138
Do you have X-ray vision?
Can you see my brain?

22:28.221 --> 22:31.600
Do you have a superhero name,
like The Invisible Grandma?

22:32.017 --> 22:34.019
-[sighs] Child called me Grandma.
-Dion!

22:34.394 --> 22:37.272
What? Wait. Was my dad invisible?

22:39.441 --> 22:40.275
Uh...

22:40.734 --> 22:41.568
Sometimes.

22:42.277 --> 22:43.195
I knew it!

22:43.278 --> 22:45.280
I knew my dad was a superhero!

22:45.364 --> 22:47.783
Hey. I didn't come here to play around.

22:51.078 --> 22:52.120
I came here...

22:53.205 --> 22:54.081
about this.

22:54.623 --> 22:55.457
Have you seen him?

22:56.333 --> 22:57.250
Up close.

22:57.918 --> 22:59.211
This is what took your dad.

22:59.294 --> 23:00.253
[Dion] That's the storm.

23:00.337 --> 23:02.005
[Charlotte] Yes, and it wants to take you,

23:02.089 --> 23:04.674
so I am gonna teach you
how to use your powers to hide.

23:04.758 --> 23:06.802
-You mean fight?
-I mean hide.

23:07.761 --> 23:09.930
He's too powerful. You hide.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.183
[Charlotte]
You got a place where we can train?

23:18.939 --> 23:21.233
[Nicole] Okay,
the super doesn't let anyone down here.

23:21.316 --> 23:22.818
Like, he will evict us.

23:29.616 --> 23:31.618
[clears throat] I mean, it's not pretty.

23:32.285 --> 23:33.537
[Charlotte] It's private.

23:34.413 --> 23:35.622
That's all that matters.

23:37.207 --> 23:40.627
[shouts fanfare]

23:40.961 --> 23:42.170
[Nicole laughs]

23:42.629 --> 23:44.131
Why does your shirt say "mm-mm"?

23:44.214 --> 23:46.883
I'm the Mind Mover.
I can move things with my mind.

23:46.967 --> 23:49.886
-Hm.
-This is Pinchy. He's a super, too.

23:49.970 --> 23:51.179
No.

23:51.638 --> 23:53.140
I-I'll take Pinchy. Come here.

23:55.100 --> 23:55.976
[Charlotte] Okay.

23:56.935 --> 23:59.396
First thing I could do was create light.

24:00.021 --> 24:01.231
I remember being so excited

24:01.314 --> 24:04.234
because no more stumbling around
in the middle of the night in the dark

24:04.317 --> 24:05.235
going to the bathroom.

24:05.318 --> 24:06.194
[chuckles]

24:06.611 --> 24:10.907
Anyway, then I realized I was plugged
into the electricity in the atmosphere.

24:10.991 --> 24:12.325
-Ions.
-[Charlotte] Ions, right.

24:12.409 --> 24:16.371
I could move ions, make them refract light
away from me so that I was invisible,

24:16.455 --> 24:18.039
and then I learned a few more tricks.

24:18.582 --> 24:19.458
[electricity crackles]

24:19.541 --> 24:21.126
Hey!

24:21.209 --> 24:22.961
Hey! Can you not zap the child?

24:23.044 --> 24:25.547
I didn't hurt him. What can you do?

24:26.923 --> 24:29.718
Hey, don't look at her, look at me.
What can you do?

24:32.179 --> 24:33.013
It's all right.

24:33.096 --> 24:35.474
When I want things, they come to me,
and I can do this.

24:35.557 --> 24:37.559
[whooshing]

24:40.645 --> 24:41.855
-[Dion screams]
-[Charlotte] Oh!

24:41.938 --> 24:45.192
[Nicole] Okay, can we not
set anything on fire?

24:45.275 --> 24:47.569
Shh, shh, shh, shh. Do it again. Focus.

24:48.862 --> 24:51.865
-That's okay. Do it again. Just focus.
-O-Okay. Mm-hmm.

24:52.657 --> 24:54.659
[whooshing]

24:57.329 --> 24:59.956
-Ah, maybe that's enough.
-No. Shh.

25:00.040 --> 25:01.291
Don't shush me.

25:01.374 --> 25:03.084
Dion, concentrate. Trust yourself.

25:03.168 --> 25:04.044
[grunts]

25:05.170 --> 25:07.672
-Okay. No, no, stop. His shirt is on fire.
-[shouts]

25:07.756 --> 25:10.008
-Hey, are you all right, honey?
-[sighs]

25:10.091 --> 25:11.510
-[Dion] I'm okay.
-He's okay.

25:13.553 --> 25:14.471
You.

25:16.556 --> 25:17.682
I'll be right back.

25:17.766 --> 25:18.892
-Where are you going?
-Just...

25:18.975 --> 25:20.352
I'm gonna talk to her for a second.

25:21.228 --> 25:24.231
Hey, I don't care
what kind of powers you have.

25:24.314 --> 25:26.900
-Dion's my son. He listens to me.
-Get out.

25:27.776 --> 25:29.152
-Excuse me?
-Leave.

25:29.528 --> 25:32.239
You brought me here to do a thing.
Let me do a thing.

25:32.322 --> 25:35.367
-His shirt just caught on fire.
-He's fine.

25:35.450 --> 25:37.869
-[Dion makes fighting sounds]
-What if that killer storm comes?

25:37.953 --> 25:39.579
Well, first of all, we're inside.

25:39.663 --> 25:41.831
Second of all,
I'm the one that knows how to survive.

25:41.915 --> 25:44.876
He is safer here with me
than he will ever be with you.

25:46.962 --> 25:48.838
[Dion] Hi-yah!

25:48.922 --> 25:50.382
Go say your goodbyes,

25:50.924 --> 25:52.676
and don't come back before dark.

25:52.759 --> 25:55.011
[Dion makes explosion and fighting sounds]

25:58.431 --> 25:59.683
[inhales deeply]

25:59.766 --> 26:00.684
[sighs]

26:02.185 --> 26:03.436
[Dion] Hi-yah, hi-yah, hi-yah!

26:03.520 --> 26:05.981
[Dion makes fighting sounds]

26:06.356 --> 26:07.190
Hi-yah!

26:07.274 --> 26:08.650
-[makes fighting sounds]
<i>-</i>Hey, Bug.

26:10.402 --> 26:11.361
I'm gonna take off.

26:11.444 --> 26:12.571
No.

26:13.238 --> 26:14.823
Yeah, you know, um...

26:15.282 --> 26:16.491
You really gotta concentrate,

26:16.575 --> 26:18.910
and I got a lot of stuff
that I gotta take care of.

26:19.703 --> 26:21.580
You get to hang out
with a real life superhero.

26:22.831 --> 26:23.957
[whispers] She's mean.

26:26.626 --> 26:27.711
[Nicole laughs]

26:28.837 --> 26:31.256
[Nicole] She can help you,
so I want you to listen...

26:32.173 --> 26:34.384
and learn as much as you can, okay?

26:34.467 --> 26:37.178
And you can tell me all about it tonight.
Okay.

26:40.974 --> 26:42.017
Mmm, okay.

26:43.059 --> 26:44.644
[Nicole laughs] Come on.

26:48.231 --> 26:49.441
Right. Thank you.

26:56.698 --> 26:57.866
You know what? Um...

26:58.825 --> 27:00.869
Just in case you guys get the munchies.

27:03.455 --> 27:05.957
Only let him have one juice box.
The other one is for you.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.001
And buddy. All right?

27:09.294 --> 27:10.128
All right.

27:10.712 --> 27:12.130
Mama Warren out. [chuckles]

27:19.554 --> 27:20.388
[sighs]

27:21.598 --> 27:22.515
[Charlotte] So...

27:24.225 --> 27:25.393
Let's get started.

27:26.436 --> 27:28.188
[cell phone rings]

27:28.271 --> 27:29.773
[Charlotte yells] Get out of here!

27:30.440 --> 27:31.858
Go!

27:31.941 --> 27:32.817
Sorry!

27:32.901 --> 27:34.361
[Pat] <i>Guess where I'm calling from.</i>

27:34.444 --> 27:38.073
Inside of BIONA's top secret security lab.

27:38.782 --> 27:41.618
I am in the room where it happens.

27:42.452 --> 27:45.330
All of the research on the Iceland event
that gave Mark his powers,

27:45.413 --> 27:46.831
I've got access to all of the data,

27:46.915 --> 27:49.542
so if there's a connection
between what happened in Iceland

27:49.626 --> 27:52.295
<i>and Mark's death, to the storms,</i>
<i>I will find it.</i>

27:52.754 --> 27:53.838
This is awesome.

27:54.422 --> 27:56.591
Do they have any information on Dion?

27:56.883 --> 27:59.010
If they do,
they're keeping me in the dark.

27:59.177 --> 28:02.389
But they did say
that all of Mark's research disappeared

28:02.472 --> 28:03.932
before they got their hands on it.

28:04.015 --> 28:07.769
[stammers] Did you ever find
any of his work files when you moved?

28:08.144 --> 28:09.229
[Nicole sighs]

28:09.312 --> 28:12.065
[Nicole] <i>I haven't been through</i>
<i>most of the Mark boxes.</i>

28:12.148 --> 28:13.149
Okay, um...

28:13.858 --> 28:16.194
Well, you need to do that,
because that could really help us.

28:16.277 --> 28:17.654
Oh, I wanted to tell you,

28:18.238 --> 28:20.949
last night, Dion saw something.

28:21.032 --> 28:23.410
Uh, okay, remember the story
because I gotta run,

28:23.493 --> 28:25.912
but I will head to your place after work
and we can chat.

28:25.995 --> 28:26.830
[Nicole] <i>Wait.</i>

28:26.913 --> 28:29.791
Huh? Oh. [chuckles] This is so cute.
Okay, let's hang up at the same time.

28:29.874 --> 28:30.834
One, two, three.

28:30.917 --> 28:31.793
Pat--

28:35.964 --> 28:37.048
[Pat inhales]

28:37.424 --> 28:38.341
[horse snorts]

28:39.759 --> 28:40.969
[Pat inhales]

28:42.220 --> 28:43.304
[horse nickers]

28:44.222 --> 28:45.473
[sheep bleating]

28:46.850 --> 28:48.435
[Dion] Why do you yell so much?

28:51.104 --> 28:52.230
Why are you so sensitive?

28:53.273 --> 28:54.315
I'm not your mother.

28:55.400 --> 28:57.777
You know, it's her job
to make you feel safe,

28:57.861 --> 28:59.696
but you are not safe.

28:59.779 --> 29:01.614
That storm is after you.

29:01.698 --> 29:03.032
And it's after me, too,

29:03.116 --> 29:05.243
so why don't we stop worrying
about being nice

29:05.326 --> 29:07.412
and try to figure out how to outsmart it?

29:09.456 --> 29:12.000
-Okay.
-Okay.

29:12.792 --> 29:14.544
Okay, yeah. Uh...

29:15.503 --> 29:16.796
Uh...

29:18.548 --> 29:19.424
Okay.

29:21.718 --> 29:22.635
Have a seat.

29:23.887 --> 29:24.721
Now...

29:25.638 --> 29:26.723
What else can you do?

29:27.348 --> 29:29.142
Besides, you know,
move things with your mind

29:29.225 --> 29:31.519
and make a ball of electricity?

29:31.936 --> 29:33.104
What else can you do?

29:33.188 --> 29:35.064
I used to be able to teleport, but...

29:35.899 --> 29:36.775
not anymore.

29:36.858 --> 29:37.942
What happened?

29:40.779 --> 29:43.156
[sighs] I almost got hit by a car.

29:43.615 --> 29:44.491
[Charlotte sighs]

29:44.866 --> 29:45.950
And it scared you?

29:46.034 --> 29:48.870
It scared everyone.
Since then, it's stuck.

29:49.537 --> 29:50.371
Well, try it.

29:51.039 --> 29:52.248
-I can't.
-Yeah, you can.

29:52.332 --> 29:53.708
Just go, just go, just try.

29:54.667 --> 29:57.420
Don't-- don't go far.
Just... Just try across the room.

29:59.380 --> 30:00.632
[whoosh]

30:02.926 --> 30:04.052
[exhales]

30:09.516 --> 30:10.850
When's my mom coming back?

30:12.018 --> 30:12.936
Where'd you go?

30:13.478 --> 30:14.479
-[zaps]
-Ah!

30:14.729 --> 30:15.939
-Ah!
-[Charlotte] Save yourself.

30:16.022 --> 30:16.856
-[zaps]
-Ah!

30:16.940 --> 30:17.816
[Charlotte] Hide.

30:18.107 --> 30:18.942
-[zaps]
-Ah!

30:19.442 --> 30:21.444
[Charlotte] Can't outrun me.
I can see you.

30:22.111 --> 30:24.280
But if you teleport,
I won't know where you are.

30:24.364 --> 30:25.240
Stop it!

30:29.410 --> 30:30.328
Are you giving up?

30:31.621 --> 30:33.873
Why can't you just teach me
how to disappear?

30:33.957 --> 30:36.376
[groans] 'Cause what you can do
is so much better.

30:37.126 --> 30:38.962
When I'm invisible, I'm still here.

30:39.420 --> 30:41.673
The Crooked Man finds me,
I'm still in danger.

30:41.756 --> 30:43.800
You can teleport yourself to safety.

30:44.300 --> 30:47.387
Or in front of a car,
and be smashed all over the road,

30:47.470 --> 30:49.806
with my guts hanging out
in front of everybody.

30:53.393 --> 30:54.227
[quietly] Come here.

30:55.353 --> 30:56.354
You're not afraid.

30:57.355 --> 30:58.690
You're afraid of scaring your mom.

31:02.277 --> 31:03.778
She already gets too sad.

31:05.071 --> 31:07.907
And you think if you don't use your powers
it'll make her happy?

31:08.741 --> 31:11.619
-Yeah.
-Oh, you are not responsible for her, kid.

31:12.161 --> 31:13.162
She's an adult.

31:13.246 --> 31:15.206
By the way, she's allowed to feel sad.

31:15.290 --> 31:18.751
She lost her husband
and her kid can move things with his mind.

31:19.544 --> 31:21.421
Not that any of that should stop you.

31:22.672 --> 31:23.631
[sighs]

31:24.090 --> 31:25.967
You have abilities
that your mom doesn't have,

31:26.050 --> 31:28.136
and that scares her, and I get it, but...

31:28.553 --> 31:31.806
you making yourself small
is not gonna help anybody right now.

31:32.348 --> 31:36.144
You... You can't shrink yourself
to make other people comfortable.

31:37.687 --> 31:38.897
You shrink yourself.

31:39.355 --> 31:40.899
You hide from everybody.

31:42.942 --> 31:43.776
Yeah.

31:45.278 --> 31:46.529
And it isn't fun.

31:50.992 --> 31:53.369
Your dad could teleport.

31:54.454 --> 31:55.622
It didn't save him.

31:57.290 --> 32:00.001
That's because he stayed to save me.

32:00.084 --> 32:01.711
So I'm gonna save you.

32:02.253 --> 32:03.087
Come on.

32:04.756 --> 32:05.590
Do this.

32:06.841 --> 32:10.595
Okay, now, don't look at your hand,
look at the space around your hand,

32:11.095 --> 32:13.765
and imagine all those little ions.

32:13.848 --> 32:17.518
Now imagine all those little ions are like
little soldiers guarding your hand.

32:17.602 --> 32:19.312
Uh, stormtroopers?

32:19.395 --> 32:20.647
Sure, stormtroopers.

32:20.939 --> 32:24.817
Now, imagine the stormtroopers standing
really close together to form a wall,

32:25.401 --> 32:27.195
and then, they turn around,

32:27.487 --> 32:29.697
and when they do that...

32:31.449 --> 32:32.575
Whoa!

32:33.034 --> 32:34.118

-Did you get locked out of your apartment?
-[Nicole] No.

34:04.167 --> 34:07.628
Dion's working on a project.
I'm just trying to give him some space.

34:08.004 --> 34:08.921
Can I go say hi?

34:09.005 --> 34:11.215
No, uh, he's actually with a tutor.

34:11.758 --> 34:13.092
-Don't worry, he's fine.
-He's--

34:13.176 --> 34:17.221
He's got his magic watch
and everything is under control, you know?

34:17.305 --> 34:18.139
Um...

34:18.931 --> 34:21.309
I'm trying really hard
not to hover over him.

34:21.392 --> 34:22.477
Like a helicopter parent?

34:22.560 --> 34:24.228
-[chuckles] Sorry.
-Did you really...

34:24.312 --> 34:28.524
No, you... You're... You're allowed.
Uh, your situation is... bonkers.

34:29.108 --> 34:30.818
-Right.
-[Pat] But good for you,

34:30.902 --> 34:33.321
letting him spread his wings a little bit.

34:33.404 --> 34:35.615
Letting him fly solo.

34:35.698 --> 34:37.325
[sighs]

34:37.408 --> 34:38.910
He's not flying, is he?

34:38.993 --> 34:40.369
No. No.

34:40.453 --> 34:42.538
-[chuckles]
-[Pat] Okay. Uh...

34:43.039 --> 34:45.333
-Any luck finding Mark's data?
-No.

34:46.459 --> 34:47.376
-Hm.
-[Nicole] Yeah.

34:47.460 --> 34:49.170
I really hope I didn't toss it
in the move.

34:49.253 --> 34:51.964
I don't think he would leave it
lying around the house.

34:52.715 --> 34:54.926
Or at work, because I don't think...

34:56.052 --> 34:57.178
he trusted BIONA.

34:58.054 --> 35:01.265
So, we just... We... It's fine,
but we need to find it before they do.

35:01.349 --> 35:03.601
Why are you loitering
outside of my building?

35:03.684 --> 35:05.728
-I need to call the cops or something?
-No, I...

35:05.812 --> 35:08.648
-Oh, Tessa, you remember Pat, right?
-[Pat] Hey.

35:08.731 --> 35:10.149
-Oh, yeah.
-Yeah.

35:10.233 --> 35:13.569
You see Malik, tell him get his butt home.
I sent him to the store half an hour ago,

35:13.653 --> 35:16.405
and I can't make dinner
without my baby Brussels sprouts.

35:17.240 --> 35:19.200
Um, can we maybe just get out of here?

35:19.283 --> 35:21.244
-Yeah, let's take a walk.
-Just for a minute? Okay.

35:21.327 --> 35:23.788
[Pat] I just wanna talk to you
about a couple of things.

35:23.871 --> 35:25.206
[Nicole] I completely forgot...

35:25.289 --> 35:27.125
[both continue talking indistinctly]

[horn honks]

[Pat] Um...

35:35.341 --> 35:36.509
Okay, so...

35:36.592 --> 35:37.510
Here, hold on.

35:37.593 --> 35:40.429
So, Suzanne showed me around L5 today,

35:40.513 --> 35:43.850
which has gone through a remodel
since the last few days.

35:43.933 --> 35:45.017
What kind of remodel?

35:46.102 --> 35:49.397
All evidence of them
tracking people around the world, gone.

35:49.480 --> 35:51.149
But the animals were still there.

35:51.607 --> 35:52.859
Well, except for Pinchy.

35:53.651 --> 35:55.153
-Yeah. She...
-[chuckles]

35:55.903 --> 35:59.574
Well, no, she totally suspects us on that,
but she... she isn't saying anything.

35:59.657 --> 36:02.118
I think she's angling for bigger fish.

36:02.201 --> 36:03.035
Like what?

36:03.244 --> 36:07.331
[sighs] Like figuring out
why Iceland is disintegrating.

36:08.082 --> 36:10.042
Part of the forest is diseased now,

36:10.126 --> 36:12.086
and she seems to think
I know something about it,

36:12.170 --> 36:15.631
but she pointed out a fox
that came from the diseased area.

36:16.174 --> 36:19.343
Dion and I saw it, and it was... sick.

36:19.427 --> 36:20.428
Like...

36:20.511 --> 36:22.346
Like, on death's doorstep sick.

36:22.430 --> 36:23.681
And, uh...

36:24.724 --> 36:28.060
after we snuck into the lab,
miraculously healed.

36:29.228 --> 36:30.104
S...

36:30.730 --> 36:31.606
And you...

36:32.106 --> 36:33.149
You think Dion did it?

36:33.232 --> 36:34.442
I mean...

36:34.942 --> 36:36.694
has he ever healed anything before?

36:37.236 --> 36:40.615
I mean, not that I know of,
but his powers could be growing and...

36:40.698 --> 36:41.657
-Okay.
-Oh.

36:42.074 --> 36:44.952
Last night Dion saw a storm
outside his bedroom window,

36:45.036 --> 36:47.997
with a man made of lightning
in the center.

36:48.080 --> 36:50.708
-No, no, no, no. Oh, my God.
-I mean, it didn't try to hurt him.

36:50.791 --> 36:52.210
But why... why was it there?

36:52.710 --> 36:56.631
Like, I mean, does it...
does it know about him or his abilities?

36:56.714 --> 36:58.758
-I-I don't know.
-Okay, we shouldn't leave him alone.

36:58.841 --> 37:00.760
Hey, he's not alone.

37:01.385 --> 37:03.095
-He's safe.
-Safe with who?

37:03.471 --> 37:04.305
He's safe.

37:04.388 --> 37:05.306
[scoffs]

37:05.389 --> 37:07.975
[stammers] Are we, like,
keeping secrets now or...

37:08.059 --> 37:10.895
Calm down.
He's my responsibility, remember?

37:10.978 --> 37:12.146
-[laughs]
-Sorry.

37:12.230 --> 37:13.940

-Yeah.

and you didn't like me, remember?

40:09.782 --> 40:12.201
-Well, I--
-And then, I had Dion.

40:12.284 --> 40:15.538

for us to hang out in pool halls.
