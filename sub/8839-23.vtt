17:09.653 --> 17:10.528
NO, SIR. FORGET THAT.

17:10.696 --> 17:11.654
WHAT?

17:11.822 --> 17:12.905
YOU AIN'T GIVING THEM
ANY MEDICINE.

17:13.073 --> 17:14.741
I KNOW WHO THESE TWO ARE.

17:14.908 --> 17:19.328
NO, NOT MEDICINE.
NOT THE MEDICINE THAT MY BOY
AND THE OTHERS NEED HERE.

17:19.496 --> 17:20.371
MR. BERWICK--
NO.

17:20.539 --> 17:22.749
LISTEN,
THEY'RE SICK, TOO,

17:22.916 --> 17:26.044
AND THEY NEED MEDICINE
JUST LIKE THE REST
OF THE FOLK.

17:26.211 --> 17:28.337
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

17:28.505 --> 17:29.338
HUH?

17:29.506 --> 17:31.424
HEY, I KNOW
WHO THEY ARE.

17:31.592 --> 17:33.634
THEY'RE THE ONES
THAT KILLED MY WIFE,

17:33.802 --> 17:35.386
MAYBE MY BOY AND
THESE OTHER PEOPLE.

17:35.554 --> 17:37.346
THEY DON'T DESERVE
TO LIVE.

17:37.514 --> 17:42.602
WHY DON'T YOU LET THAT
BE THE LORD'S DECISION,
MR. BERWICK, NOT YOURS.

17:42.770 --> 17:43.811
WHAT...

17:43.979 --> 17:47.190
MR. BERWICK,
GO BACK TO YOUR BOY.

18:16.845 --> 18:19.472
CHARLES? JONATHAN?

18:30.192 --> 18:31.400
I NEED YOUR HELP.

18:31.568 --> 18:32.318
JUST NAME IT.

18:32.486 --> 18:33.945
TO FIGHT THE INFECTION,

18:34.113 --> 18:37.115
EACH ONE OF THESE PATIENTS
NEEDS 15 GRAINS
OF CARBOLIC ACID

18:37.282 --> 18:39.075
AND 30 GRAINS OF
QUININE DAILY.

18:39.243 --> 18:42.203
NOW, WE'RE RUNNING
DANGEROUSLY CLOSE ON BOTH.

18:42.371 --> 18:45.331
JUST AS IMPORTANT,
MAYBE EVEN MORE SO,

18:45.499 --> 18:47.583
THEY NEED SOMETHING
TO SUSTAIN THEM.

18:47.751 --> 18:49.752
NOW, NONE OF THEM ARE EATING
VERY MUCH AT ALL.

18:49.920 --> 18:51.838
THEY NEED SOMETHING
TO STRENGTHEN THEM,

18:52.005 --> 18:54.757
LIKE IRON, CINCHONA, WINE.

18:54.925 --> 18:56.592

18:56.760 --> 18:59.512
STRONG WINE,
EASY TO DIGEST.

18:59.680 --> 19:01.139

WANT US TO DO?

19:01.306 --> 19:05.518

20:38.528 --> 20:43.074
THERE'S NOTHING ELSE
OUR DR. BAKER CAN DO,

20:43.242 --> 20:44.200

39:05.968 --> 39:10.221

39:11.766 --> 39:12.849
WE WON'T SAY
A THING TO ANYBODY.

39:13.017 --> 39:14.559
WE WON'T EVEN
GO NEAR THE LAW.

39:14.727 --> 39:18.063
ALL WE WANT TO DO

39:38.000 --> 39:39.667
I KNOW I'M GOING
TO STRIKE A VEIN.

39:39.835 --> 39:42.337
IT'S NOT JUST THE BOY.
YOU TWO CAN GET
THE ANTHRAX, TOO.

39:42.505 --> 39:45.340
