(birds chirping)

01:05.567 --> 01:06.266
(sighs)

01:06.333 --> 01:09.533
Woe is me.
Woe, oh, woe is me.

01:11.000 --> 01:12.934
Problem, Blanche?

01:13.333 --> 01:15.333
Yes. It's my hair.

01:15.400 --> 01:19.533
It has split ends, it's listless,
it makes my face look, uh...

01:19.600 --> 01:21.033
Its age?

01:24.300 --> 01:27.066
If you're going to make fun of somebody,
make fun of rose.

01:30.033 --> 01:34.533
I need the professional care of the
most talented hairdresser, Robaire.

01:34.600 --> 01:35.567
Oh, he's brilliant.

01:35.633 --> 01:37.967
Do you know he was the first
to use mousse?

01:38.033 --> 01:41.200
I'd check my facts if I were you.

01:41.266 --> 01:45.500
Mr. Ingrid of St. Olaf has been using
moose ever since I can remember.

01:45.567 --> 01:49.600
'Course it's his professional secret
which part of the moose he uses.

01:53.900 --> 01:58.367
But it'll keep your hair in place
in winds up to 130 mph.

01:59.166 --> 02:01.734
I just don't believe you, Rose.

02:01.800 --> 02:03.433
Ask Conway Twitty.

02:05.934 --> 02:08.867
Robaire charges $300,

02:08.934 --> 02:10.667
and it's just not in my budget this month.

02:10.734 --> 02:13.100
Oh, that's the trouble
with being beautiful.

02:13.166 --> 02:15.266
The maintenance will kill you.

02:16.300 --> 02:20.166
I have an idea. How about moonlighting
and making some extra money?

02:20.233 --> 02:25.567
I already work my fingers to the bone
12 hours a week at the museum.

02:25.633 --> 02:28.100
"Picasso on your left,
snack bar downstairs."

02:28.166 --> 02:30.300
It's a wonder I'm not an alcoholic.

02:31.800 --> 02:34.100
How about working for me?

02:34.166 --> 02:37.066
I'm swamped with this project
for Enrique Mas.

02:37.133 --> 02:40.233
-There is money for an assistant.
-Tell me more.

02:40.300 --> 02:44.467
Well, we're compiling statistics
on supplemental health care for seniors.

02:44.533 --> 02:46.734
Some companies are preying on fear

02:46.800 --> 02:49.767
and then using loopholes
to avoid paying claims.

02:49.834 --> 02:53.033
For someone on fixed income,
it's a life and death matter.

02:53.100 --> 02:55.767
By tell me more,
I mean, does it pay $300?

02:57.567 --> 03:01.600
Well, I suppose that would be ok,
but I can't believe

03:01.667 --> 03:04.900
with something this important,
you're still so self-centered.

03:04.967 --> 03:06.667
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Count me in.

03:07.900 --> 03:10.900
Oh, Dorothy, can you drive me
to the mall Friday night?

03:10.967 --> 03:12.266
They're giving free blood pressure tests,

03:12.333 --> 03:14.800
and some of the girls
and I have a high-low bet.

03:20.300 --> 03:21.934
Ma, don't you remember?

03:22.000 --> 03:25.800
Friday night we're planning on
having dinner at Joe's Stone crab.

03:25.867 --> 03:29.066
-Oh?
-Honey, it's your wedding anniversary.

03:29.133 --> 03:33.867
-Oh, yeah, right. Sounds nice.
-Ma, you didn't forget, did you?

03:33.934 --> 03:35.934
Oh, forgive me.
I forgot something.

03:36.000 --> 03:39.066
Maybe you should ship me
back to Shady Pines.

03:39.834 --> 03:43.867
If you'll excuse me,
I'll be in the living room being feeble...

03:43.934 --> 03:46.600
if I can find the living room.

03:48.600 --> 03:50.567
(Blanche)
Dorothy, what just happened?

03:50.633 --> 03:51.834
Weren't you listening?

03:51.900 --> 03:56.066
Sophia asked Dorothy to drive her
to the mall for a blood pressure test.

03:56.133 --> 04:01.233
Then Dorothy told Sophia
that they had a date for dinner Friday--

04:01.300 --> 04:03.734
-Would you hand me the newspaper?
-Oh.

04:03.800 --> 04:06.066
Uh, the metro section.

04:06.133 --> 04:08.333
That she and the girls...
(groans)

04:15.667 --> 04:17.533
(chuckles)

04:18.000 --> 04:22.533
-Hey, don't kill the messenger.
-(exhales)

04:22.600 --> 04:25.700
It's ma. She's...
She's becoming more forgetful.

04:25.767 --> 04:29.433
-She denies it and gets mad.
-(Rose) How bad is it?

04:29.500 --> 04:32.767
Bad. It's not just small things anymore.

04:32.834 --> 04:35.767
I can't believe she forgot this dinner.

04:35.834 --> 04:38.300
Every year since my father died,

04:38.367 --> 04:41.133
I've taken her to dinner
on her wedding anniversary

04:41.200 --> 04:42.533
because she's lonely.

04:42.600 --> 04:45.066
Maybe you better talk to her doctor.

04:45.133 --> 04:49.500
You're right. I've just been hoping things
would improve by themselves.

04:49.567 --> 04:52.767
(sighs)
I never thought ma would lose her memory.

04:52.834 --> 04:56.600
Of course I never thought
Alan Alda would get on my nerves.

05:00.033 --> 05:02.033
Ma, can we talk for a minute?

05:02.100 --> 05:03.567
(Sophia)
I'm going through the family album.

05:03.633 --> 05:05.900
I thought I'd pay your father a visit.

05:07.333 --> 05:10.767
Look. Here we all are.

05:10.834 --> 05:13.567
-Your sweet 16 party, right?
-Right.

05:13.633 --> 05:16.166
Oh, look at that beautiful chiffon dress.

05:16.233 --> 05:19.367
Yeah, your brother Phil
always did like to make a splash.

05:21.133 --> 05:27.266
Ah, look.
The Jersey Shore. Summer 1939.

05:27.333 --> 05:30.800
Pop loved playing with you.
Why do I look upset?

05:30.867 --> 05:32.533
Ma, don't you remember?

05:32.600 --> 05:35.600
Pop was a big fan of Jean Harlow.

05:35.667 --> 05:39.166
You hated it when he made sand breasts
in front of the children.

05:41.934 --> 05:45.166
He was really some character.

05:45.233 --> 05:47.333
Oh, look at us.

05:47.400 --> 05:51.200
Oh, boy,
your father sure looks stupid.

05:51.266 --> 05:54.433
Stupid? This was one
of your favorite pictures.

05:54.500 --> 05:56.767
Pop looks so proud.

05:56.834 --> 05:58.767
He's dressed like an organ grinder.

05:58.834 --> 06:00.934
Yes. Yes, he is.

06:01.000 --> 06:04.700
Remember, we had no money,
and he refused to go on assistance.

06:04.767 --> 06:08.200
He vowed to take any job to feed us.

06:08.266 --> 06:10.867
We had meat every night.

06:10.934 --> 06:13.433
I don't know how he did it
on ten cents a day.

06:13.500 --> 06:14.834
Where's the monkey?

06:18.967 --> 06:23.033
Oh, look.
There you are, stirring sauce.

06:23.100 --> 06:24.734
Ah, my old kitchen.

06:24.800 --> 06:29.066
Yeah, and the potholders grandma made.
Your pasta maker.

06:29.133 --> 06:33.734
Ah, the pantry. Remember what pop kept
behind the pantry door?

06:33.800 --> 06:38.266
Yeah. He carved a giant heart
that said, "Sal loves Sophia."

06:38.333 --> 06:41.200
No, Ma.
It was our height measurements.

06:41.266 --> 06:43.700
He kept track of them on that door.

06:43.767 --> 06:48.867
That was my Sal. He put the heart there
because he loved me.

06:48.934 --> 06:50.200
That I remember!

06:50.266 --> 06:51.867
I'm sure you do.

06:52.266 --> 06:56.734
Listen, Ma,
why don't we talk to your doctor

06:56.800 --> 06:59.166
and see what he has to say?

06:59.233 --> 07:01.367
Yeah, well, maybe.

07:01.433 --> 07:04.600
I don't remember half these photos.
I don't remember Brooklyn.

07:05.133 --> 07:08.533
I don't even remember
you're going to your senior prom.

07:08.600 --> 07:11.767
Ma, I never went to my senior prom.

07:13.166 --> 07:14.500
Actually, I remembered that,

07:14.567 --> 07:17.467
but why should I be the only one
to feel like crap?

07:22.700 --> 07:23.834
(calm music playing)

07:23.900 --> 07:24.967
(birds chirping)

07:26.633 --> 07:27.700
Hi.

07:27.767 --> 07:30.367
I thought you were working.

07:30.433 --> 07:33.667
You don't think playing three sets
of tennis in this heat is work?

07:35.200 --> 07:37.934
When are you going to
get the survey done?

07:38.000 --> 07:40.033
Rose, let me explain something.

07:40.100 --> 07:43.734
In this world,
there are two kinds of people,

07:43.800 --> 07:48.166
one is an industrious,
hard-working, give-100%,

07:48.233 --> 07:51.000
pain-in-the-butt-to-everybody-else
go-getter.

07:51.066 --> 07:54.233
(gasps)
I am not one of those people.

07:55.400 --> 07:57.800
Gee, I wish I felt better about this.

07:57.867 --> 08:00.467
Well, I wish you did, too.
(chuckles)

08:03.066 --> 08:05.333
Sophia! Dorothy!
How'd it go at the doctor's?

08:05.400 --> 08:06.700
It was great.

08:06.767 --> 08:11.166
He said ma's memory problem could be
related to a nutritional imbalance.

08:11.233 --> 08:15.800
If she follows her special diet,
she'll be fine from here on.

08:15.867 --> 08:18.633
Oh, lucky me.
I can remember from now on.

08:18.700 --> 08:20.700
My whole past is gone.

08:24.266 --> 08:26.967
I could've slept with JFK
and don't even know it.

08:30.033 --> 08:32.500
Ma... I don't think so.

08:32.567 --> 08:35.900
You're not mentioned
in any of the books. (laughs)

08:35.967 --> 08:38.800
Well, that doesn't necessarily
mean anything.

08:41.367 --> 08:42.834
Ma, come on now.

08:42.900 --> 08:45.867
He also said there are things you can do

08:45.934 --> 08:48.166
that might bring back
some of what you've lost.

08:48.233 --> 08:52.734
We could talk about the good old days,
reminisce with old friends.

08:52.800 --> 08:55.033
You have to look on the bright side.

08:55.433 --> 08:59.867
I've had a lifetime of bright sides.
I'll just have to do without them.

08:59.934 --> 09:04.066
Oh, damn it. I hate watching
what this is doing to her.

09:04.133 --> 09:06.400
I hate watching what it's doing to you.

09:06.467 --> 09:10.633
I hate watching those FBI warnings
at the beginning of video rentals.

09:16.967 --> 09:19.100
(calm music playing)

09:20.433 --> 09:22.033
Oh, hello, sir.

09:22.100 --> 09:25.700
I'm conducting a survey
regarding health care for the elderly.

09:25.767 --> 09:29.800
May I ask your age?
Well, that's not so old.

09:29.867 --> 09:34.734
And what's your general health?
Well, that's good.

09:35.400 --> 09:37.767
What would you say
is your annual income?

09:38.700 --> 09:41.767
Oh, that's very good.

09:42.433 --> 09:44.233
Marital status?

09:44.900 --> 09:47.500
Oh, I am sorry. How long?

09:47.967 --> 09:49.767
Three weeks.

09:49.834 --> 09:52.867
I'd say it's time you get on
with your life, honey.

09:52.934 --> 09:54.633
(laughs)

09:55.367 --> 09:57.200
Thank you very much.

09:57.967 --> 10:01.700
Blanche, marital status
is not a question on the survey.

10:01.767 --> 10:04.500
I ask a man 20 questions.

10:04.567 --> 10:08.266
You can bet one is going to be,
"Are you married?"

10:08.333 --> 10:10.867
Unbelievable.
Haven't you done anything?

10:10.934 --> 10:14.333
Of course I have.
You see this big stack?

10:14.400 --> 10:17.066
Well, just behind it
is what I have done.

10:18.266 --> 10:21.734
It's only one survey
but I'm very proud of it.

10:22.900 --> 10:26.734
I should've known this would happen.
You should never work with friends.

10:26.800 --> 10:28.500
You're fired.

10:30.700 --> 10:32.367
You can't fire me.
That's against the law.

10:32.433 --> 10:34.667
That's sex discrimination.

10:35.934 --> 10:39.400
Oh, well,
I'll give you one more chance.

10:40.233 --> 10:43.834
Wait a minute.
How is it sex discrimination?

10:43.900 --> 10:47.900
That's what I was doing this afternoon
instead of working.

10:52.767 --> 10:53.934
How's Sophia?

10:54.000 --> 10:56.266
I don't know.
Today's her anniversary.

10:56.333 --> 10:59.467
She won't come out of her room.
I've never seen her like this.

10:59.533 --> 11:01.734
She is really depressed.

11:01.800 --> 11:05.967
<i>Adios.</i> Everybody wave goodbye.
I'm off to Brooklyn.

11:06.033 --> 11:09.800
What are you doing?
I'm going back to the old neighborhood,

11:09.867 --> 11:12.400
trying to stir up some memories.

11:12.467 --> 11:16.433
-You can't go back there alone.
-No kidding. I'm 83.

11:16.500 --> 11:19.567
I walk to the driveway,
it's a coin toss whether I get back.

11:20.600 --> 11:23.333
-You're coming with me.
-I am?

11:23.400 --> 11:25.266
What the hell? You paid.

11:27.200 --> 11:30.100
Look, I can deal with losing
some of my memory.

11:30.166 --> 11:33.633
If I didn't have to remember
what's-her-name, I wouldn't care.

11:37.500 --> 11:40.333
But Sal was the most
important person in my life,

11:40.400 --> 11:42.734
and scrapbooks
aren't doing the trick.

11:43.133 --> 11:46.500
Ok, Ma, if this is what you really want.

11:46.567 --> 11:48.233
It's what I have to do.

11:48.300 --> 11:53.967
Dorothy, today is my anniversary,
and I barely remember getting married.

11:56.100 --> 11:59.367
You know, I hate getting old.

11:59.433 --> 12:03.200
You always seem to be losing something.
First it's your eyesight.

12:03.266 --> 12:07.300
Then people are telling you to turn down
the TV set when you can barely hear it.

12:07.367 --> 12:10.200
And you could live with that.
But this?

12:10.266 --> 12:13.934
They're trying to take something from me
that I just won't give.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.567
I can't let this happen, Dorothy.

12:17.333 --> 12:20.567
I can't lose my Sal, not again.

12:21.533 --> 12:24.300
(slow music playing)

12:28.066 --> 12:31.133
(calm music playing)

12:37.166 --> 12:39.967
Isn't it good to be back
in the old neighborhood

12:40.033 --> 12:42.600
watching kids play
stickball on the corner?

12:42.667 --> 12:45.066
Ma, they were beating a man.

12:52.133 --> 12:55.734
That was sort of why I called the police.

12:56.133 --> 12:58.433
Ah, they were just having a good time.

12:58.500 --> 12:59.767
(doorbell rings)

12:59.834 --> 13:04.600
Ma, I don't want you to be disappointed
if the new tenants don't let us in.

13:05.467 --> 13:06.600
<i>Buenos dias.</i>

13:07.000 --> 13:08.100
Oh, God.

13:16.667 --> 13:20.533
Uh, hi, I'm Dorothy Zbornak.
This is my mother Mrs. Petrillo.

13:20.600 --> 13:26.033
Um, I know this is going to sound odd,
but we lived here many, many years ago,

13:26.100 --> 13:31.700
and we were hoping we could look around
for old times' sake. Could we?

13:31.767 --> 13:34.967
Petrillo?
They let Italians live here?

13:36.266 --> 13:39.700
Look, we came all the way from Miami.
Please.

13:39.767 --> 13:42.567
Ok, but don't take anything.

13:46.133 --> 13:47.400
Oh.

13:49.500 --> 13:52.533
I'm meeting my family.
You only have a little while.

13:52.600 --> 13:56.567
We appreciate it very much.
My mother's having a memory problem.

13:56.633 --> 13:59.934
We hoped if we looked
around the apartment.

14:00.000 --> 14:03.333
There's no need to explain.
I have an elderly mother.

14:04.700 --> 14:06.066
-Oh, one more thing.
-Yes.

14:06.133 --> 14:07.600
Don't take anything.

14:10.266 --> 14:14.600
Dorothy, look. My old wallpaper.
Oh, God, it feels the same.

14:16.500 --> 14:19.033
And that big window I used to look out of.

14:21.400 --> 14:25.967
Oh, Ma, I remember when I was
a little girl, playing out in the street.

14:26.033 --> 14:29.533
I can still hear your voice,
"Dorothy, fix your dress.

14:29.600 --> 14:32.100
The whole neighborhood
can see your business."

14:34.467 --> 14:38.033
-Sounds like me.
-We don't have too much time.

14:38.100 --> 14:39.967
Let's get in the kitchen.

14:40.033 --> 14:42.200
I'll show you that heart
your father carved

14:42.266 --> 14:44.533
and prove I'm not crazy.

14:45.567 --> 14:49.867
Remember, it's only a carving.
Don't put all your eggs in one basket.

14:49.934 --> 14:53.867
Hey, I may be fading,
but that's the sweetest thing he ever did.

14:53.934 --> 14:56.533
I know that heart's behind the door.

14:57.200 --> 14:58.967
(exhales)

15:04.900 --> 15:08.867
I can't believe it.
They must have sanded it off.

15:08.934 --> 15:13.400
No, Ma. No, no.
See? It's our height chart.

15:13.467 --> 15:17.000
You can see it through the paint.
See? Here's Phil.

15:17.066 --> 15:19.300
Gloria, me.

15:23.266 --> 15:27.567
I could have sworn.
I would have bet my life on it.

15:27.633 --> 15:31.700
There are so many memories.
Don't be so down.

15:31.767 --> 15:34.367
Remember when you brought Phil back
from the hospital?

15:34.433 --> 15:38.433
I was upset because that was the day
pop usually took me to the zoo.

15:38.500 --> 15:41.500
Well, it was the race track
but he called it the zoo.

15:42.233 --> 15:45.967
You kept Phil in this room
because it was the warmest room

15:46.033 --> 15:50.600
and I guess I was a little starved
for attention because I remember...

15:51.133 --> 15:54.367
Oh, Salvadore.
Isn't he beautiful?

15:54.433 --> 15:56.000
A piece of art.

15:56.066 --> 15:58.867
But what do you have him
in Dorothy's hand-me-downs for?

15:58.934 --> 16:01.867
So he wears girl's clothes for a while.
What's it gonna hurt?

16:09.033 --> 16:10.900
(shatters)

16:11.300 --> 16:15.600
Dorothy. Sal, do something
about your daughter.

16:16.567 --> 16:19.000
Dorothy, come over here.

16:22.767 --> 16:27.467
We know you're upset about the new baby,
but we need for you to be a big girl.

16:27.533 --> 16:29.467
Your mother's had a rough week.

16:29.533 --> 16:33.433
First I'm called away,
and then the baby's delivered by a cabbie.

16:33.500 --> 16:34.900
Cesarean.

16:37.633 --> 16:40.400
I know you think Phil
is taking your place.

16:40.900 --> 16:44.900
Well, I wanna tell you something.
I love you more than anything.

16:45.633 --> 16:48.600
Even more than the dodgers
on 5-cent beer night?

16:49.767 --> 16:51.367
Okay, even more than that.

16:52.166 --> 16:53.367
Wow.

16:54.166 --> 16:57.934
-Daddy, I love you.
-I love you too.

16:58.000 --> 17:00.533
Come on, let's go to the zoo.

17:00.600 --> 17:04.266
I got a tip on a giraffe
in the sixth race. (laughs)

17:07.767 --> 17:11.533
Pop sure taught me a lot
about sibling rivalry.

17:11.600 --> 17:13.867
When we got home,
I went right over to the baby

17:13.934 --> 17:15.967
and said, "I love you, Phil."

17:16.033 --> 17:18.467
No, wait, I wrote it on him.

17:20.367 --> 17:23.400
(gloomy music playing)

17:28.100 --> 17:30.867
(birds chirping)

17:35.200 --> 17:38.166
Here you go, Rose.
Finished my work.

17:39.233 --> 17:42.867
Well, turn me upside down
and paint me blue.

17:44.100 --> 17:45.967
Well, give me my money.

17:46.967 --> 17:48.500
I'm sorry we fought.

17:48.567 --> 17:51.934
Working for senior health care's
important for me.

17:52.033 --> 17:56.333
-I was hoping it would be for you, too.
-It wasn't, but it is now.

17:56.400 --> 17:58.633
-It is?
-How could I help it?

17:58.700 --> 18:01.200
After I looked through the paperwork,
I realized how expensive

18:01.266 --> 18:03.900
health care is for the elderly.

18:03.967 --> 18:06.567
Some have lost their life savings.

18:06.633 --> 18:09.200
People ought to write their congressman.

18:09.266 --> 18:14.667
I'm so touched, when you cut my check,
don't make it out to me.

18:15.066 --> 18:19.934
-That's beautiful, Blanche.
-Make it out to hair by Robaire.

18:21.867 --> 18:23.500
I'm not declaring it as income

18:23.567 --> 18:26.867
and let those lazy congressmen
have my tax dollars.

18:27.266 --> 18:29.066
I don't want to do that.

18:29.133 --> 18:31.867
Ok, then just pay me under the table.

18:31.934 --> 18:35.967
Oh, I know that trick.
Dorothy's done that to me before.

18:36.033 --> 18:38.533
(chuckles) I go under the table,
and you never show up.

18:38.600 --> 18:40.333
No way.

18:48.834 --> 18:51.166
(slow music playing)

18:52.100 --> 18:56.133
Boy, this room is sure alive
with memories.

18:56.200 --> 19:01.000
Those were good days.
I'll think I'll go up to the bedroom.

19:01.066 --> 19:04.066
Sal and I spent our most
intimate moments there.

19:05.333 --> 19:09.567
-Is there anything I can do for you?
-Yeah. Stay out.

19:09.633 --> 19:11.900
You barged in enough
when you were a kid.

19:33.767 --> 19:38.266
Sallie, what's going on?
What's wrong with me?

19:38.333 --> 19:41.533
You think you've got problems?
Try being dead.

19:41.600 --> 19:45.600
-(laughs)
-Sal, what the hell are you doing here?

19:45.667 --> 19:50.367
Hey, relax. I'm not really here.
I'm just a fig newton of your imagination.

19:50.433 --> 19:52.100
(laughs)

19:52.500 --> 19:56.467
It's been so long, I'd forgotten
how much you liked Norm Crosby.

19:57.367 --> 20:00.834
-So how are things?
-How are things?

20:00.900 --> 20:05.200
Sal, talk to me. How are you?
What's new? What's heaven like?

20:05.266 --> 20:08.400
Everyone thinks heaven is right above.

20:08.467 --> 20:11.133
Actually, it's a little more to the left.

20:12.900 --> 20:15.367
-What's God like?
-Nice.

20:15.433 --> 20:17.367
You should see his car.

20:19.033 --> 20:21.834
Oh, before I forget, Gladys says hello.

20:21.900 --> 20:23.333
You fooling around with Gladys?

20:23.400 --> 20:26.333
No. Gladys is going out
with Charlemagne.

20:28.000 --> 20:32.700
Sophia, I see from upstairs
you kind of lost your spunk.

20:32.767 --> 20:34.066
What's the matter?

20:34.133 --> 20:36.934
I'm slipping, Sal, and it's frightening.

20:37.000 --> 20:40.133
I'm even forgetting you,
forgetting the good old days.

20:40.200 --> 20:43.734
-I'm supposed to feel sorry for you?
-That would be a start.

20:43.800 --> 20:48.567
No. The Sophia I know is a survivor.
That's why we married.

20:48.633 --> 20:50.333
You beat out a lot of other women.

20:50.400 --> 20:54.000
There was a long line
waiting to get you.

20:55.367 --> 20:57.967
What's the name of that girl
with the warts?

20:58.767 --> 21:03.667
-You see? Some things you do remember.
-Yeah, but only some things.

21:03.734 --> 21:06.834
I'm 83. I don't have the energy for this.

21:06.900 --> 21:08.467
You've lost your spunk.

21:08.934 --> 21:12.800
You know, maybe I don't find you
so attractive anymore.

21:12.867 --> 21:16.567
-What?
-You're not the same Sophia.

21:16.633 --> 21:19.567
I wonder how Gladys
and Charlemagne are doing.

21:19.633 --> 21:22.633
Sure, the guy rewrote history,
but can he juggle?

21:23.033 --> 21:26.600
Salvador Petrillo,
you miserable, Bagiagaloop!

21:26.667 --> 21:28.900
If you so much
as look at another ghost--

21:28.967 --> 21:33.600
The spunk's still there,
but use it for yourself, not on me.

21:33.667 --> 21:38.200
-You think I'll be ok?
-If not, would I have come?

21:38.266 --> 21:41.066
-I miss you, Sallie.
-I'm always with you.

21:41.133 --> 21:43.967
When the time's right,
see you at my place.

21:56.333 --> 21:59.400
Ma. Ma, Mr. Hernandez has to go.

21:59.467 --> 22:02.834
I'm meeting the wife and kids.
We're going ice-skating.

22:03.233 --> 22:05.900
Dorothy, oh, my God,
can you believe it?

22:05.967 --> 22:10.367
Hey, Puerto Ricans can ice-skate.
Jeez.

22:10.433 --> 22:13.567
Dorothy. Dorothy, look.

22:14.200 --> 22:17.233
It's the carving, see?
"Sal loves Sophia."

22:17.300 --> 22:20.166
-Oh, Ma!
-You're Sophia?

22:20.233 --> 22:25.033
That's right, and I remembered.
I mixed up the rooms, but I remembered.

22:25.100 --> 22:27.667
Of course I thought the carving
was in the kitchen.

22:27.734 --> 22:30.400
Sal used to hang his salamis here.

22:31.233 --> 22:34.767
I'm fading,
but I'm holding on to big things.

22:34.834 --> 22:39.300
-And you might get more back.
-Might? I insist.

22:39.367 --> 22:42.200
All I need is a little more spunk.

22:42.266 --> 22:45.133
Imagine finding that carving in here.

22:45.200 --> 22:48.734
Kitchen, bedroom,
I knew it was a room I was good in.

22:59.867 --> 23:00.934
(blow kiss)

23:01.767 --> 23:04.600
(slow music playing)

23:19.100 --> 23:22.300
(theme music playing)
