WEBVTT

00:01.120 --> 00:03.509
That was very nice, Mindy.

00:03.680 --> 00:04.954
Okay.

00:05.120 --> 00:07.236
Jake, we're ready to hear your report.

00:08.520 --> 00:11.557
- Jake?
- Just a sec.

00:12.160 --> 00:13.832
Now, Jake.

00:14.560 --> 00:18.155
Okay, I'm finished.

00:19.720 --> 00:23.235
- Does spelling and grammar count?
- It's an oral report, Jake.

00:23.400 --> 00:25.311
Oh, so it's like an oral thermometer.

00:25.480 --> 00:26.754
Right.

00:27.480 --> 00:29.391
Good thing it's not a rectal report.

00:31.080 --> 00:33.469
- Just read it.
- Okay.

00:34.040 --> 00:36.235
"My Weekend, by Jake Harper.

00:36.400 --> 00:38.391
Grade five, Mrs. Flanigan's class.

00:38.560 --> 00:41.438
Woodward Avenue Elementary School,
located on Woodward Avenue."

00:41.600 --> 00:42.953
I'm not counting words.

00:43.440 --> 00:45.670
Oh, good.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.390
"My weekend starts on Friday, when
my mom takes me to my dad's house.

00:52.560 --> 00:54.516
Which is actually
my Uncle Charlie's house.

00:54.680 --> 00:56.716
Who is my dad's brother,
making him my uncle.

00:56.880 --> 00:59.838
His name is Charlie, which is why
I call him my Uncle Charlie."

01:02.200 --> 01:03.918
Anyway...

01:04.080 --> 01:06.799
<i>"Even though my parents are divorced,</i>
<i>they still get along."</i>

01:06.960 --> 01:08.109
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, Dad.

01:08.280 --> 01:09.759
- How was your week?
- Just fine.

01:09.920 --> 01:11.194
- Bye, honey.
- Bye, Mom.

01:11.360 --> 01:13.749
- Thanks for bringing him.
- Bite me. What the hell...

01:13.920 --> 01:16.388
...went on last weekend?
- What are you talking about?

01:16.560 --> 01:19.358
When I brought him home Sunday
night and served him dinner...

01:19.520 --> 01:22.114
...he tipped me with a $25 chip
from Caesars Palace...

01:22.280 --> 01:24.999
...and told me I had a nice rack.

01:26.160 --> 01:28.958
Well, Judith...

01:33.880 --> 01:35.677
...you do.

01:35.840 --> 01:37.592
That's not the point.

01:37.760 --> 01:40.479
Where'd he get the chip?
Where is he learning this behavior?

01:40.640 --> 01:42.631
Hey, Judith.

01:43.400 --> 01:45.356
Looking good.

01:45.920 --> 01:49.117
Run away, run away.

01:49.280 --> 01:52.113
Did you give my son a $25 chip?

01:52.280 --> 01:54.748
- No, I did not give him a $25 chip.
- Happy?

01:54.920 --> 01:57.753
He won it, fair and square.

01:58.400 --> 02:00.311
You couldn't run away.

02:00.480 --> 02:02.232
I don't care what you do on weekdays.

02:02.400 --> 02:05.710
But on weekends, remember you are
a role model for an 11 -year-old boy.

02:05.880 --> 02:09.475
Oh, that's a bad idea.
Who thought of that?

02:09.639 --> 02:13.679
I'm warning you. Things had better
change or there will be consequences.

02:13.840 --> 02:16.308
Legal consequences. Got it?

02:16.880 --> 02:19.110
- Got it.
- Goodbye.

02:23.720 --> 02:27.269
"There will be serious consequences.

02:27.440 --> 02:30.352
Legal consequences."

02:30.520 --> 02:33.796
"I don't care what you do
during the week.

02:34.560 --> 02:37.279
But on the weekends,
you're a role model."

02:38.760 --> 02:40.318
I enjoy talking this way.

02:42.520 --> 02:44.431
As do I.

03:10.240 --> 03:11.719
"Friday night, I stayed up late.

03:11.880 --> 03:14.269
I watched all three <i>Austin Power</i>
movies with my dad.

03:14.440 --> 03:16.317
We ate Chinese food
and Buffalo wings.

03:16.480 --> 03:18.755
Dad fell asleep during
<i>The Spy Who Shagged</i> Me...

03:18.920 --> 03:21.878
...which, in my opinion,
is the strongest of the trilogy.

03:22.840 --> 03:25.149
By the way,
'shag' means 'sex' in England."

03:25.680 --> 03:27.398
Just read, Jake.

03:27.880 --> 03:29.154
That was a footnote.

03:29.680 --> 03:32.797
- Read.
- Okay.

03:32.960 --> 03:34.837
"I woke up later with a stomachache...

03:35.000 --> 03:37.514
...but felt better after
I went to the bathroom."

03:37.680 --> 03:39.033
If you know what I mean.

03:40.640 --> 03:42.278
- Jake.
- What? It's not like I said:

03:42.440 --> 03:43.953
"I took a dump."

03:49.120 --> 03:51.953
<i>"Anyway, I tried to go back to sleep</i>
<i>but I couldn 't.</i>

03:52.120 --> 03:53.678
<i>Probably because I was thirsty.</i>

03:53.840 --> 03:57.799
<i>So I went into the kitchen for what</i>
<i>Uncle Charlie calls a 'virgin screwdriver. '</i>

03:57.960 --> 04:00.110
<i>But really it's just a glass</i>
<i>of orange juice.</i>

04:00.280 --> 04:03.875
<i>It was late, so I decided</i>
<i>to skip the glass."</i>

04:10.400 --> 04:11.958
Jake?

04:13.040 --> 04:15.076
Hang on.

04:17.880 --> 04:19.199
That one hurt a little.

04:20.079 --> 04:22.310
- What you doing?
- Having a virgin screwdriver.

04:22.480 --> 04:25.074
- Want some?
- No, thanks. I'm good.

04:26.080 --> 04:29.072
- What are you doing?
- Watching TV.

04:29.760 --> 04:31.591
Why isn't it on?

04:32.280 --> 04:34.191
Because I've seen this one already.

04:35.760 --> 04:37.876
- Hey, you wanna hear a funny joke?
- Sure.

04:38.040 --> 04:40.031
Why did the blond stare
at the juice carton?

04:40.200 --> 04:41.189
I don't know. Why?

04:41.360 --> 04:43.476
"Cause the carton said
'concentrate.'"

04:47.360 --> 04:49.112
That's okay. I didn't get it either.

04:50.240 --> 04:52.515
"The next morning
I was pretty hungry because..."

04:53.080 --> 04:54.399
I think you all know why.

04:57.920 --> 05:01.310
<i>"So I had a bowl of cereal with my dad,</i>
<i>and we made plans for the day."</i>

05:02.400 --> 05:05.278
- You wanna go to the museum?
- No. I wanna watch TV.

05:05.960 --> 05:08.110
It's pretty windy out there.
Wanna fly a kite?

05:08.280 --> 05:10.236
No. I wanna watch TV.

05:11.440 --> 05:13.078
- Hiking?
- TV.

05:25.520 --> 05:26.953
- I'll get it.
- TV.

05:29.880 --> 05:31.711
<i>"We decided to watch TV."</i>

05:34.200 --> 05:36.873
- Hello.
- Is your name Harper?

05:37.040 --> 05:39.793
- Yes.
- Then this is for you.

05:43.520 --> 05:46.830
- Why'd you do that?
- Why did you sleep with my wife?

05:48.840 --> 05:50.990
Charlie.

05:55.520 --> 05:56.839
Busy.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.878
I don't care. Open the door.

06:01.680 --> 06:03.636
- I've got company.
- I know.

06:03.800 --> 06:05.791
And her husband's downstairs.

06:06.440 --> 06:08.317
Really?

06:08.480 --> 06:10.118
- You're married?
- Yeah.

06:13.520 --> 06:15.431
I'm not in.

06:16.120 --> 06:17.792
You have to come and deal with him.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.479
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

06:19.680 --> 06:21.113
I disagree.

06:21.280 --> 06:23.430
It's not up for debate.
He knows you're here.

06:24.240 --> 06:26.071
Oh, man, I hate when this happens.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.239
This happens a lot?

06:28.400 --> 06:30.391
Not a lot, but enough to be a drag.

06:32.280 --> 06:34.510
Charlie, are you coming back to bed?

06:35.040 --> 06:36.473
- Yes.
- Yes? No "yes."

06:36.640 --> 06:38.710
There is an angry husband
in your living room.

06:38.880 --> 06:40.632
How angry?

06:40.800 --> 06:42.677
- Is he packing?
- What?

06:42.840 --> 06:44.876
- Does he have a weapon?
- L... He has a stick.

06:45.400 --> 06:47.834
That's not good.
I could lose an eye.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.116
- Charlie! Come on.
- Fine, I'll wrap it up here.

06:50.280 --> 06:52.271
- Give me 20 minutes.
- Oh, no.

06:52.440 --> 06:53.873
A better idea. Wrap it up now.

06:55.640 --> 06:57.073
- Ten minutes?
- Now.

06:59.200 --> 07:01.668
We got five minutes.

07:02.680 --> 07:06.229
<i>"The weekend was going great, but then</i>
<i>something really bad happened."</i>

07:06.400 --> 07:08.834
- Hey.
- Hello.

07:09.000 --> 07:11.639
- Who are you?
- I'm Norman.

07:11.800 --> 07:15.110
I'm Jake.
Have you seen my Game Boy?

07:15.280 --> 07:17.999
No. Have you seen my wife?

07:18.920 --> 07:21.354
No. Well, if you see it, let me know.

07:21.520 --> 07:22.794
Ditto.

07:25.520 --> 07:26.794
<i>"I couldn 't believe it.</i>

07:27.360 --> 07:28.713
I lost my Game Boy."

07:35.240 --> 07:38.038
"I couldn't find my Game Boy
in the kitchen or living room...

07:38.200 --> 07:40.191
...so I checked my bedroom
and my bathroom.

07:40.360 --> 07:44.433
Because, as you may recall, I'd spent
a lot of time in there the night before."

07:51.320 --> 07:54.357
- He'll be right down.
- Thank you.

08:01.920 --> 08:03.876
Can I get you a cup of coffee?

08:04.880 --> 08:07.348
Decaf. I'm already pretty enraged.

08:09.800 --> 08:12.519
Well, that's certainly understandable.

08:14.640 --> 08:16.232
I have cookies too.

08:17.760 --> 08:21.799
- I wouldn't say no to a cookie.
- Good. Come on in the kitchen.

08:21.960 --> 08:24.997
I always find a nice cookie
can brighten up even the darkest day.

08:25.160 --> 08:27.628
Yeah, well, this better be
one hell of a cookie.

08:29.160 --> 08:31.628
- It's a nice house you got here.
- Oh, thank you.

08:31.800 --> 08:33.073
Actually, it belongs to my...

08:35.039 --> 08:36.996
You live in the neighborhood?

08:38.880 --> 08:41.440
- Bel-Air.
- Oh, that's nice too.

08:41.600 --> 08:44.558
Gated community,
but the wife gets out anyway.

08:47.800 --> 08:49.233
Chews through her leash, huh?

08:51.920 --> 08:54.150
Hey, let me get you that cookie.

08:54.320 --> 08:57.471
You see like a nice fella.
I'm sorry I hit you with my stick.

08:57.640 --> 08:59.835
Oh, that's okay.
I'm sorry my brother is...

09:01.640 --> 09:03.949
That's okay.

09:04.120 --> 09:06.190
So women, huh?

09:06.680 --> 09:08.398
Can't live with them.

09:11.280 --> 09:13.032
That's all I got.

09:13.200 --> 09:15.111
- You married?
- Divorced.

09:15.280 --> 09:18.352
- She sleep around?
- No, mostly just slept.

09:19.880 --> 09:21.154
You're lucky.

09:21.320 --> 09:25.074
There's no pain greater than being
betrayed by the woman you love.

09:25.240 --> 09:28.277
You know, these are really very tasty.

09:28.960 --> 09:30.518
Aren't they?

09:30.680 --> 09:34.036
- Good morning.
- Oh, speaking of tasty cookies...

09:34.200 --> 09:36.634
...Norman, this is Berta.

09:36.800 --> 09:39.189
- Hello.
- What is this, a fix-up?

09:42.160 --> 09:44.355
No, no. Nothing like that.

09:44.520 --> 09:46.476
That's good,
because I'd probably kill him.

09:50.160 --> 09:53.152
Nothing personal, Cotton Top.
I just kind of like it rough.

09:58.280 --> 10:01.670
- Have another cookie.
- Thank you.

10:01.840 --> 10:04.195
So is anybody gonna tell me
what's going on?

10:04.360 --> 10:06.271
Well, it's a little complicated.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.351
- Charlie...
- Got it.

10:09.600 --> 10:10.953
Got it? How could you get it?

10:11.800 --> 10:14.394
There's a Rolls-Royce in the driveway...

10:14.560 --> 10:17.950
...and I found these
hanging on the mailbox...

10:18.120 --> 10:21.157
...so I'm guessing that your brother's
got some bimbo upstairs...

10:21.320 --> 10:23.675
...and Norman here is her daddy
or her sugar daddy.

10:24.720 --> 10:26.756
- Tell me I'm wrong.
- I'm the husband.

10:26.920 --> 10:28.319
Judges?

10:31.040 --> 10:34.749
- You gotta give it to her.
- Yes.

10:34.920 --> 10:37.150
- I mean, tough break.
- Thank you.

10:37.320 --> 10:39.276
- You got a gun?
- No!

10:39.800 --> 10:41.074
- Want one?
- Berta!

10:42.920 --> 10:44.433
I'm making small talk.

10:46.640 --> 10:47.914
Okay.

10:48.080 --> 10:50.310
You wanna talk this out like gentlemen,
or you...?

10:53.320 --> 10:55.470
You might've mentioned
he fought at the Alamo.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.798
- No offense.
- None taken.

11:04.320 --> 11:06.470
- Does that make us even?
- You tell me.

11:07.600 --> 11:09.158
Okay. One more.

11:12.720 --> 11:13.994
How about that?

11:14.160 --> 11:17.516
- He poked you, you poked his...
- Berta!

11:18.560 --> 11:21.279
What? How often do you see
that kind of symmetry in life?

11:30.960 --> 11:32.234
Hey.

11:33.520 --> 11:34.794
Hello.

11:34.960 --> 11:36.791
Were you just up in
Uncle Charlie's room?

11:36.960 --> 11:38.871
- Yeah.
- Did you see my Game Boy?

11:39.040 --> 11:40.029
No.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.111
- Did you see my husband?
- The old guy?

11:42.280 --> 11:43.872
- Yeah.
- He's in the kitchen.

11:44.040 --> 11:46.634
Thanks.

11:48.520 --> 11:50.397
Well, that's weird.

11:50.560 --> 11:52.676
If I was a Game Boy,
where would I be?

11:54.440 --> 11:57.989
I am so sorry.
I had no idea that she was married.

11:58.160 --> 12:01.232
I have a firm rule when it comes
to sleeping with married women.

12:01.400 --> 12:04.198
Yeah, if she's firm enough,
he'll do her.

12:08.800 --> 12:10.995
Sorry. Isn't there something
you could clean?

12:11.160 --> 12:14.197
I'm guessing you could
use a good scrubbing.

12:16.240 --> 12:18.151
Wait a minute.

12:19.400 --> 12:22.358
<i>"And suddenly I realized...</i>

12:22.520 --> 12:24.988
...I might have left it
in my mom's car."

12:25.160 --> 12:28.197
Hey, Mom, did I leave
my Game Boy in your car?

12:28.360 --> 12:30.112
Well, can you go look?

12:30.280 --> 12:32.350
Can't you just dry off
and put on a robe?

12:32.800 --> 12:34.995
There's another $25 chip in it for you.

12:37.400 --> 12:40.198
She wasn't wearing a ring.
There was no mention of a husband.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.237
Is that supposed to cheer me up?

12:42.400 --> 12:45.836
- No, no, no. I just wanted you to know...
- Now, now. I get it.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.470
You're a nice guy,
and I married a skeevy tramp.

12:49.640 --> 12:52.677
No, no, no.
I mean, yeah, I am a nice guy...

12:52.840 --> 12:54.831
...but I'm sure Annette
is a lovely woman.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.150
Her name is Natalie.

12:57.720 --> 13:01.269
- Really? You sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

13:01.440 --> 13:04.273
Because I've been yelling
"Annette" all night.

13:04.440 --> 13:07.113
Her name is Natalie.

13:07.280 --> 13:09.999
Well, then maybe this is all
just a huge misunderstanding...

13:10.160 --> 13:13.072
...and I've been upstairs
doing someone else's wife.

13:13.240 --> 13:17.631
Five-foot six, long brown hair,
butterfly tattoo on her left hip.

13:18.200 --> 13:20.350
Left hip, huh?

13:26.680 --> 13:29.797
Hold on now.
A lot of women have butterfly tattoos.

13:31.040 --> 13:34.874
But the one I slept with also had a little
beauty mark in a certain intimate place.

13:35.040 --> 13:36.951
I'm not here to claim a lost wallet.

13:39.240 --> 13:43.074
Okay, let's just assume it's her.
Again, I am really sorry.

13:43.240 --> 13:45.879
It's my own fault anyway.

13:46.040 --> 13:48.190
I should've realized
back when I married her...

13:48.360 --> 13:51.193
...a man my age couldn't satisfy
a woman that young.

13:51.360 --> 13:54.796
If it makes you feel any better,
I couldn't ring her bell, either.

13:54.960 --> 13:57.315
- You couldn't?
- You don't know me...

13:57.480 --> 13:59.311
...but there's things I don't kid about.

14:00.200 --> 14:02.589
So it's not just me.

14:02.760 --> 14:04.079
- That's a relief.
- Tell me...

14:04.240 --> 14:06.151
...about it.
I was killing myself up there.

14:07.280 --> 14:08.554
So anyway...

14:08.720 --> 14:09.994
...are we okay?

14:10.160 --> 14:13.038
You mean, aside from the fact
that you just rolled off my wife?

14:13.200 --> 14:15.839
Oh, yeah. We're aces.

14:17.280 --> 14:19.589
Good. Thank you.

14:19.920 --> 14:23.196
- Can I give you a little advice, kid?
- Sure.

14:23.360 --> 14:25.590
I was a player once, like you.

14:25.760 --> 14:27.876
Do tell.

14:28.040 --> 14:31.828
Does the name Tuesday Weld
mean anything to you?

14:32.960 --> 14:34.678
No.

14:35.240 --> 14:36.912
Joey Heatherton?

14:37.080 --> 14:38.559
No.

14:39.440 --> 14:42.398
The immortal Miss Anne Francis.

14:44.360 --> 14:46.396
TV's Honey West.

14:48.240 --> 14:50.959
- Sorry.
- Well, look them up on your Internet.

14:51.120 --> 14:53.588
They were all hot, and I nailed them.

14:55.960 --> 14:58.918
Really. Well, kudos.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.156
But nothing lasts forever.

15:02.320 --> 15:05.551
There's going to come a time
when you'll wanna settle down.

15:05.720 --> 15:08.280
And I only hope you don't make
the same mistake I did.

15:08.440 --> 15:09.839
I picked a young hottie...

15:10.000 --> 15:13.470
...because I figured I'd die in the sack
with a smile on my face.

15:13.960 --> 15:16.474
That's my retirement plan.

15:16.640 --> 15:18.835
But it doesn't work that way.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.468
What happens is...

15:22.160 --> 15:24.230
...you get your heart broken...

15:24.400 --> 15:26.709
...and you wind up having
coffee with some putz...

15:26.880 --> 15:28.757
...who never heard of Honey West.

15:31.240 --> 15:32.798
Got it.

15:32.960 --> 15:34.313
Thanks for the advice.

15:34.920 --> 15:36.478
Well, I'll be getting home now.

15:36.640 --> 15:39.916
I got lawyers to call, locks to change.

15:40.080 --> 15:42.992
Maybe I'll stop at the market,
pick up some of those cookies.

15:43.160 --> 15:45.958
- Here. Take the box.
- Oh, thanks.

15:46.120 --> 15:48.953
Looks like I'm the big winner
around here today.

15:53.560 --> 15:57.269
- Hello? Anybody home?
- Hello.

15:58.720 --> 16:00.995
- Hello. Who are you?
- Norman.

16:01.160 --> 16:03.435
Oh, hello, Norman. I'm Evelyn.

16:04.120 --> 16:06.588
Is that your magnificent Rolls-Royce
out in the drive?

16:06.760 --> 16:08.239
Why, yes, it is.

16:08.400 --> 16:10.470
- Are you a friend of Charlie's?
- No.

16:10.640 --> 16:12.790
But my wife is.

16:13.640 --> 16:16.996
Did my son polish your trophy wife?

16:19.320 --> 16:21.390
Well, you seem
like a very intelligent man.

16:21.560 --> 16:23.471
I assume you had an airtight prenup.

16:23.640 --> 16:24.914
Bulletproof.

16:25.080 --> 16:26.718
You know what, Norman?

16:26.880 --> 16:29.792
You look a lot like my fifth husband.

16:29.960 --> 16:33.270
Really?
How many times you been married?

16:33.440 --> 16:35.431
Four.

16:37.800 --> 16:40.030
Cookie?

16:40.200 --> 16:43.272
"When Grandma came over,
I thought things couldn't get any worse.

16:43.440 --> 16:45.032
But instead of making me visit...

16:45.200 --> 16:48.476
...she gave my dad money to take me,
my uncle and Berta to the movies.

16:48.920 --> 16:51.639
We saw the Rob Schneider movie
where he plays a stupid guy.

16:51.800 --> 16:54.678
I had popcorn, nachos
and two jumbo red Slurpees.

16:54.840 --> 16:57.513
But as you know,
you don't buy Slurpees. You rent them."

17:01.840 --> 17:04.479
- Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.
- Cool your jets.

17:04.640 --> 17:07.393
And if you can't cool them,
point the nozzle away from me.

17:09.560 --> 17:11.198
Oh, God. Mom!

17:12.200 --> 17:13.838
- We can't go in right now.
- Why not?

17:14.000 --> 17:17.470
Because I can't afford to send you
to therapy for the rest of your life.

17:17.640 --> 17:19.835
What's going on?

17:20.000 --> 17:23.356
- Oh, God!
- What? What, what, what?

17:23.520 --> 17:27.194
Good for Norman.
That's getting right back on the horse.

17:27.359 --> 17:30.318
- There's a horse in there?
- No, no. No horse.

17:30.480 --> 17:33.631
- Well, I still have to pee.
- So go water that bush over there.

17:33.800 --> 17:35.836
<i>"And so I did.</i>
<i>And it just goes to show...</i>

17:36.400 --> 17:38.550
...it's always
in the last place you look."

17:39.040 --> 17:40.678
Very nice, Jake.

17:40.840 --> 17:43.070
"Then on Sunday,
we all went out for breakfast...

17:43.240 --> 17:44.753
...with Grandma and Uncle Norman.

17:44.920 --> 17:48.390
I had chocolate-chip pancakes
with blueberry syrup and bacon.

17:48.560 --> 17:51.393
Dad had scrambled eggs
but with no yolks. Just the whites.

17:51.560 --> 17:53.437
They looked like mashed potatoes.

17:53.600 --> 17:57.957
Then the kid next to us threw up
his waffles. It was awesome."

17:59.120 --> 18:01.918
- So, what's new in school?
- Almost got an A on my paper.

18:02.440 --> 18:03.873
What do you mean "almost"?

18:04.360 --> 18:05.998
Got a C.

18:08.560 --> 18:10.869
Okay, that's... That's fine.
That's an improvement.

18:11.280 --> 18:13.271
Minus.

18:13.440 --> 18:15.032
Still, here's your dollar.

18:16.720 --> 18:18.711
You're paying him for a C-minus?

18:18.880 --> 18:22.316
That was our deal. A buck for every C,
a car for every A.

18:23.640 --> 18:25.870
- A car?
- Safest bet in the world.

18:27.280 --> 18:30.590
- So, what was the report about?
- What we did last weekend.

18:34.560 --> 18:37.199
- No kidding?
- Yeah. And guess what else happened.

18:37.360 --> 18:40.352
Trevor Griffin saw a ginormous rat
in the cafeteria.

18:40.520 --> 18:43.193
Yeah, but about the paper.

18:43.360 --> 18:46.352
You wrote about everything
that happened here last weekend?

18:47.280 --> 18:49.874
Well, everything but the boring stuff.

18:50.040 --> 18:52.429
Oh, this could be problematic.

18:52.600 --> 18:54.989
No, it's called "summarizing."

18:59.760 --> 19:01.671
- Can I see it?
- Sure.

19:01.840 --> 19:05.753
But it's at Mom's house.
I gave it to her to read this weekend.

19:08.440 --> 19:10.670
He's 11.
There's no way it stands up in court.

19:14.240 --> 19:16.754
Does this smell funny to you?

19:41.520 --> 19:43.511
