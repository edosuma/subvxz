through the walls,
you know?

12:37.657 --> 12:41.027
Well, small world.

12:41.060 --> 12:43.763
You know, Colby, I actually
do have a room opening up here.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.499
(Mike)
No, you don't.

12:46.499 --> 12:49.068
Paige pulled
the transfer papers.

12:49.068 --> 12:50.136
She's staying.

12:50.169 --> 12:51.738
Is that right?

12:51.738 --> 12:53.740
I guess
I'm staying retired.

12:53.740 --> 12:55.608
Colby Moore.

12:55.608 --> 12:57.277
So much for my cover.

12:57.310 --> 12:58.611
Tattoo on your neck.

12:58.611 --> 13:01.447
It's an Armenian cross
and you're not Armenian, so...

13:01.481 --> 13:04.050
I figure you're the last agent
under the Sarkissian family.

13:04.083 --> 13:06.452
Yeah, I got it after
my first year under with Ari--

13:06.486 --> 13:07.720
sign of respect.

13:07.754 --> 13:10.189
Hmm. Briggs said
he formulated a new plan.

13:10.223 --> 13:12.358
I guess you're it.

13:12.392 --> 13:14.394
I'm part of it.

13:14.427 --> 13:16.396
So are you,
if you're up for it.

13:16.429 --> 13:19.065
Fill me in later.
Got to run.

13:43.990 --> 13:46.759
[scoffs]

13:48.695 --> 13:51.264
What the hell?

13:51.297 --> 13:52.532
What the hell
are you doing here, man?

13:52.565 --> 13:53.533
You following me?

13:53.566 --> 13:55.101
Figured I'd find
you and your girl

13:55.134 --> 13:57.136
in some Tecate love shack.

13:57.136 --> 13:59.539
Seafaring in Tijuana
with a gang full of blow--

13:59.539 --> 14:01.407
this--this is new.

14:01.407 --> 14:03.409
Go home.

14:03.409 --> 14:05.278
How long you been
diming us out to Carlito?

14:05.278 --> 14:07.480
I ain't been diming you out
to nobody. Go home.

14:07.513 --> 14:10.683
Then, please,
illuminate me.

14:10.717 --> 14:14.420
You tell him
we were shutting him down?

14:14.420 --> 14:18.358
[chuckles]
This is beyond, Johnny.

14:18.391 --> 14:19.559
This is beyond.

14:19.592 --> 14:21.494
It's like you're trying
to invent new ways

14:21.527 --> 14:22.662
to be incompetent.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.430
Go home, Jakes.

14:24.430 --> 14:26.299
If I was Briggs, you wouldn't be
keeping tabs on me,

14:26.332 --> 14:28.000
now, would you?

14:28.000 --> 14:29.736
You're not Briggs.

14:33.473 --> 14:36.709
Tell me what's going on.
Tell me what I'm looking at.

14:40.179 --> 14:42.148
He's going to kill Lucia.

14:42.181 --> 14:43.516
What?

14:43.549 --> 14:45.284
He knows about us.
He knows about all of us, okay?

14:45.318 --> 14:46.319
Jesus.

14:46.319 --> 14:47.687
He knows Mike
shut down the planes,

14:47.720 --> 14:50.289
so this is how he's got me
moving the coke.

14:50.323 --> 14:54.394
Look, man, I got 16 hours
to get this to San Pedro.

14:54.427 --> 14:57.196
Either arrest me or get the hell
off the boat, man.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.598
Okay, you got
to tell your people.

14:58.598 --> 15:00.299
- The Bureau?
- Yeah.

15:00.333 --> 15:02.502
She'll be dead for sure, man.
Look, I got it.

15:02.535 --> 15:03.669
God damn it.

15:03.703 --> 15:05.405
I just need some time to
figure out this plan, all right?

15:05.438 --> 15:07.673
Go home. For real.

15:11.010 --> 15:13.713
How do we get
this thing moving?

15:13.713 --> 15:15.047
What?

15:15.081 --> 15:18.050
You said you need to go, right?
Let's go.

15:20.353 --> 15:22.054
Bro, you even know
which way starboard is?

15:22.088 --> 15:24.323
Don't push me,
Johnny.

15:26.726 --> 15:29.228
It's this side.

15:29.262 --> 15:31.197
That's port, son.

15:33.065 --> 15:35.701
Hey, it could be
starboard too.

15:39.071 --> 15:40.039
Thanks, man.

15:54.487 --> 15:56.489
The motel will be easy,
but the bar--

15:56.489 --> 15:57.723
Don't worry
about the bar, bro.

15:57.757 --> 15:59.759
I'm worried about the bar.
Ari likes what he likes.

15:59.992 --> 16:02.195
And you said that
Ari likes Nancy's, okay?

16:02.228 --> 16:03.663
The place is small.
It's controllable.

16:03.696 --> 16:04.764
We will make it work.

16:04.997 --> 16:06.399
We've covered
every angle, Colby.

16:06.399 --> 16:08.334
Beginning to end,
it's a straight shot.

16:08.367 --> 16:10.069
Yeah, through
the eye of a needle.

16:10.102 --> 16:12.104
Then I guess we'll have to have
nimble fingers, then, won't we?

16:12.104 --> 16:13.372
I wouldn't be here

16:13.372 --> 16:15.174
if I didn't think
your plan could work, Briggs,

16:15.208 --> 16:17.109
but let's not
kid ourselves.

16:17.143 --> 16:18.211
It's airtight, man.

16:18.244 --> 16:21.447
Let's just put these pieces
in motion, huh?

16:21.481 --> 16:23.382
You think your roommates
will be down?

16:23.416 --> 16:27.220
Well, I guess we will
find out tomorrow.

16:27.253 --> 16:30.223
All right.

16:30.256 --> 16:32.625
- Godspeed.
- Be safe.

16:34.227 --> 16:37.430
[footsteps approaching]

16:38.698 --> 16:41.300
Hey. We need to talk.

16:41.300 --> 16:42.635
No, we don't.

16:42.668 --> 16:44.403
Look, Paige,
Warren may have forgiven you,

16:44.403 --> 16:45.638
but that doesn't mean
I have, okay?

16:45.671 --> 16:48.407
You betrayed us all.
You can't stay in Graceland.

16:48.407 --> 16:51.077
Wow.
You're so full of it.

16:51.110 --> 16:52.612
You want to talk
about betrayal,

16:52.645 --> 16:54.680
let's talk about the shit
you put Charlie through.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.115
That is none
of your business, sweetheart.

16:56.148 --> 16:57.517
Don't patronize me.

16:57.550 --> 17:00.987
We know too much about
each other to play that game.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.022
And, anyways, it isn't
about all of that.

17:03.055 --> 17:04.991
This is about Mike.

17:05.024 --> 17:07.426
What kind of chickens
were they?

17:07.460 --> 17:08.628
What do you mean what kind?

17:08.661 --> 17:12.365
I don't know.
Were they--were they red?

17:12.398 --> 17:13.399
They were reddish.

17:13.432 --> 17:16.269
Mm-hmm.
How many were there?

17:16.302 --> 17:18.471
I wasn't exactly
doing inventory, Briggs.

17:18.504 --> 17:20.006
Why?
What's going on?

17:20.039 --> 17:21.707
[sighs]

17:21.707 --> 17:23.976
Look, Mike died.
He came back again.

17:24.010 --> 17:26.579
He saw something
in between.

17:26.579 --> 17:29.649
I'll talk to him,
see where his head is at.

17:29.682 --> 17:32.184
Okay?

17:32.184 --> 17:34.387
Okay.

17:48.734 --> 17:50.436
(man)
What are you looking for, chief?

17:50.436 --> 17:51.704
Oxy.

17:51.704 --> 17:53.172
Too late.

17:53.172 --> 17:57.043
You see, that shit's gone
by, uh, 10:00 a.m.

17:57.043 --> 17:58.110
You're out?

17:58.144 --> 17:59.278
I got you, man.

17:59.312 --> 18:03.349
Listen, I got T3s.
I got Trams. I got Vics.

18:03.349 --> 18:04.350
Yeah, Vicodin.

18:04.350 --> 18:06.485
Just whatever
$80 gets me.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.323
There you go, chief.

18:10.356 --> 18:13.392
And you be sure to come back
earlier next time, mm-hmm?

18:18.631 --> 18:21.334
What does this say, huh?
What does it say?

18:21.367 --> 18:23.069
- Vicodin.
- Right.

18:23.069 --> 18:25.304
And what doesn't it say?
It doesn't say HP.

18:25.338 --> 18:26.739
This means this
is a 5-milligram pill,

18:26.973 --> 18:29.709
and I just gave you $80,
which is the street value of 10.

18:29.742 --> 18:31.277
Oh. Well, if you're
a pharmacist,

18:31.310 --> 18:33.713
then why don't you go out
and get your own shit, homes?

18:33.746 --> 18:36.215
You're trying to rip me off?
I think I want a refund.

18:36.215 --> 18:37.316
- A refund?
- Yeah.

18:37.350 --> 18:38.584
What, does this look like
Target to you?

18:38.618 --> 18:40.553
Does it look like
Target to you?

18:46.559 --> 18:47.593
Just get out of here!

18:47.627 --> 18:50.396
I'll just give you
a warning this time.

18:50.396 --> 18:52.231
Go!

18:52.264 --> 18:54.166
You crooked-ass
junkie cop.

19:00.106 --> 19:04.243
[door bells jingle]

19:04.243 --> 19:07.313
[Ari speaking Armenian]

19:14.987 --> 19:16.055
Hey, boss.

19:16.088 --> 19:17.757
What's with all the muscle?

19:17.990 --> 19:19.992
Martun is code red.

19:20.026 --> 19:22.495
His daughter got herself
into a car accident.

19:22.528 --> 19:24.530
Layla?
What happened?

19:24.563 --> 19:27.166
Somebody smashed
into her car,

19:27.199 --> 19:29.468
stole a bunch
of her shit.

19:29.502 --> 19:31.137
Sounds like we need
to find this bastard

19:31.137 --> 19:32.271
and drop him
off a bridge, huh?

19:32.304 --> 19:34.140
She said it was
a black man.

19:34.140 --> 19:36.142
[speaks Armenian]

19:36.175 --> 19:37.743
She saw him?

19:37.977 --> 19:39.245
No.

19:39.278 --> 19:41.547
He was wearing a mask,
but...

19:41.547 --> 19:43.616
Layla is a racist.

19:43.649 --> 19:48.154
So I guess this is
the job of the day, huh?

19:48.154 --> 19:49.555
We have to make
the boss happy.

19:49.555 --> 19:52.558
Sure. I mean,
I can ask around, but, uh...

19:52.558 --> 19:54.760
you know
I don't work for free.

19:54.994 --> 19:57.296
Christ, guy.
You'll get your money.

19:57.296 --> 20:00.299
Right now I pay you
for nothing.

20:00.299 --> 20:03.402
[speaks Armenian]

20:03.436 --> 20:07.707
I can't let Martun find out
about me and Layla.

20:07.707 --> 20:11.243
I think I made
a terrible mistake.

20:11.277 --> 20:12.278
Hmm.

20:12.311 --> 20:14.313
Well, how about this?

20:14.346 --> 20:16.048
I know a decent little dive
over in NoHo.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.050
We could go drink
it off later.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.119
Why would I drink at a bar?
I drink here for free.

20:20.152 --> 20:21.721
Yeah, I just thought maybe
you could use a break

20:21.721 --> 20:23.589
from all the family politics.

20:23.589 --> 20:26.592
How about Nancy's?

20:26.592 --> 20:29.595
Nancy's is a good bar--
good drinks and cheap.

20:29.628 --> 20:31.063
But not today.
Today we work.

20:31.097 --> 20:32.264
Yeah, no problem.

20:32.298 --> 20:34.033
Tomorrow maybe,
after all this settles down?

20:34.066 --> 20:36.268
Whatever. Take Hovic.

20:36.302 --> 20:38.537
Check out that crash site,
see what you can find.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.639
Let's get started.

21:15.407 --> 21:17.176
[Jakes vomits]

21:17.176 --> 21:19.612
[coughs, sighs]

21:19.612 --> 21:22.047
I hate boats, Johnny.

21:22.081 --> 21:24.016
You gonna live?

21:24.049 --> 21:26.318
Yeah, just give me
five minutes.

21:30.389 --> 21:32.358
[sighs]

21:36.695 --> 21:39.999
Hey, man, you know
those two masks--

21:40.032 --> 21:42.201
one's smiling,
one's sad or something?

21:42.234 --> 21:44.170
Theater thing--
tragedy, comedy, yeah.

21:44.203 --> 21:47.973
Yeah. That's what
Lucia reminds me of.

21:50.109 --> 21:52.645
She don't seem
all that funny.

21:52.645 --> 21:53.712
Yeah, she's not.

21:53.746 --> 21:56.515
[chuckles]

21:56.549 --> 21:58.517
She's got this side to her

21:58.517 --> 22:01.720
that's, like, hard as iron...

22:01.754 --> 22:03.989
like her brother and her dad

22:03.989 --> 22:07.526
and generations
of a messed-up Solano bloodline.

22:07.526 --> 22:09.662
I feel like she was forced
to wear the frowning one

22:09.662 --> 22:12.231
her whole life.

22:12.264 --> 22:14.033
And, you know, if somebody
let her wear the happy one,

22:14.033 --> 22:17.036
she'd be pretty awesome.

22:18.671 --> 22:22.274
We're going to get
her back, Johnny.

22:22.274 --> 22:25.544
Yeah. Right.

22:25.544 --> 22:29.014
Hey, don't go all defeatist
on me, all right?

22:29.014 --> 22:30.649
[chuckles]

22:30.683 --> 22:34.153
We're, like, actually running
a bunch of dope

22:34.153 --> 22:36.288
up from Mexico, okay?

22:36.288 --> 22:38.557
It can't get much worse.

22:38.591 --> 22:40.626
[chuckles]

22:44.697 --> 22:46.398
Actually, it kind of does.

22:52.004 --> 22:55.040
I'm the one who killed Sid.

22:56.442 --> 22:58.444
What?

22:58.444 --> 23:01.380
He was helping me
get Lucia back--

23:01.413 --> 23:04.049
Oh, hold on.
Sid was helping you?

23:04.049 --> 23:05.251
No, no, not like that, man.

23:05.284 --> 23:09.722
Carlito made me smuggle him
down to Mexico...

23:09.722 --> 23:13.592
so me and him busted in
to get Lucia out,

23:13.626 --> 23:16.061
and we got her,
and then...

23:16.095 --> 23:19.298
all hell broke loose,
and...

23:19.331 --> 23:20.599
Sid was going to kill
Carlito, man.

23:20.599 --> 23:24.270
I had to make a choice,
you know?

23:26.438 --> 23:28.974
Sid's head...

23:29.008 --> 23:33.245
busted open like
a blown-out tire.

23:33.279 --> 23:36.582
I mean, I shot guys
before, you know.

23:36.615 --> 23:38.050
We all have.

23:38.083 --> 23:40.319
Hey, things get hairy.
Bullets start flying.

23:40.352 --> 23:41.687
Yeah, you on raids,
whatever,

23:41.720 --> 23:44.356
I mean, shit happens, right?

23:44.356 --> 23:47.026
I never lost a minute of sleep
over it.

23:49.628 --> 23:53.198
This was different, man.
This was like...

23:53.232 --> 23:55.067
execution.

23:55.100 --> 23:57.503
Hey...

24:07.613 --> 24:10.616
(Charlie)
So Florida State PDMP
tracks the Oxy.

24:10.616 --> 24:12.618
I find doctors
with high-volume scrips,

24:12.618 --> 24:14.320
low-volume patients.

24:14.353 --> 24:15.988
- Straw buyers.
- Exactly.

24:15.988 --> 24:18.390
Lucky for us, there's one doctor
in Miami who's a best seller.

35:43.274 --> 35:45.610
We're in.

36:02.427 --> 36:04.562
So what now?

36:04.562 --> 36:08.767
Done. Carlito's people come,
unload it. We go home.

36:08.967 --> 36:11.269
Not "what now?"
with the boat.

36:11.302 --> 36:13.405
Oh.

36:13.438 --> 36:14.673
I think you were right.

36:14.673 --> 36:17.676
Obviously.

36:17.676 --> 36:19.411
About what?

36:19.411 --> 36:21.413
I ain't Briggs.

36:21.413 --> 36:23.682
I'm gonna need his help
on this one.

36:32.257 --> 36:33.491
- Everything's already set?
- Mm-hmm.

36:33.525 --> 36:35.393
I locked down the gas station
and the hotel last night.

36:35.427 --> 36:36.428
Paul got the bar.

36:36.428 --> 36:37.762
The rest of these
are public places--

36:37.996 --> 36:39.164
lots of people
coming and going.

36:39.197 --> 36:40.265
If Ari doesn't
do what you want--

36:40.298 --> 36:42.100
Start to finish,
this takes 24 hours, Mike.

36:42.133 --> 36:43.134
I can control Ari
for a day.

36:43.168 --> 36:44.536
Okay, I have a question.

36:44.536 --> 36:49.307
If all of this goes right,
how do you imagine this ending?

36:49.307 --> 36:51.176
With Ari no longer a threat
to the living.

36:51.176 --> 36:52.177
[door opens]

36:52.210 --> 36:53.244
(Charlie)
Hey.

36:53.278 --> 36:55.313
[sighs]
Goddamn airlines, man.

36:55.346 --> 36:57.315
Had us taxiing in
for over an hour.

36:57.348 --> 36:58.316
Who's this?

36:58.349 --> 37:00.185
- Colby Moore.
- Charlie DeMarco.

37:00.185 --> 37:02.287
The Bureau's
original sin-eater.

37:02.320 --> 37:04.322
We came up with a plan to
get out from under Ari Adamian.

37:04.355 --> 37:06.391
- No shit.
- But we need your help.

37:06.424 --> 37:07.726
- No.
- Tonight.

37:07.726 --> 37:09.594
Two cross-country flights
in two days,

37:09.594 --> 37:13.298
Amber bitching about checking
her into County, I'm done.

37:16.434 --> 37:19.404
God damn it.
[sighs]

37:19.437 --> 37:21.372
(Tuturro)
Yo. Hey, Briggs.

37:21.406 --> 37:23.575
You got a minute, man?
I need your help with something.

37:23.575 --> 37:25.577
Your boy's skydiving
without a chute.

37:25.577 --> 37:27.712
Yeah, uh,
not today, Johnny.

37:27.712 --> 37:30.682
Yeah, this can't
really wait.

37:30.715 --> 37:32.083
You know what, man?
Whatever it is,

37:32.117 --> 37:33.718
I promise I'll move
Heaven and Earth for you,

37:33.752 --> 37:37.088
but right now I need you
and Jakes for 24 hours.

37:37.088 --> 37:38.189
Ari?

37:38.223 --> 37:39.290
Ari.

37:39.324 --> 37:41.159
- I'm in.
- All right. Me too.

37:41.192 --> 37:42.594
Thanks.

37:50.034 --> 37:51.002
[Briggs laughing]

37:51.035 --> 37:53.605
Where is the ass
in this place, huh?

37:53.638 --> 37:55.006
Ari, there's
ass everywhere.

37:55.039 --> 37:58.076
There's ass,
ass, ass, ass.

37:58.109 --> 38:02.213
Average.
Strictly average ass.

38:02.213 --> 38:05.583
[cell phone chimes]

38:05.617 --> 38:08.019
- Oh, shit.
- Everything all right?

38:08.052 --> 38:09.154
This bitch.

38:09.187 --> 38:10.522
"Daddy said you spent all day

38:10.522 --> 38:13.324
"looking for
the asshole who hit me.

38:13.358 --> 38:15.527
"You're my hero.
I love you.

38:15.560 --> 38:18.363
Hug, kiss, hug, kiss,
smiley face."

38:18.396 --> 38:21.399
"I love you."
When did this shit start?

38:21.432 --> 38:23.201
Layla.

38:23.234 --> 38:24.636
You know, man,
I got to tell you,

38:24.636 --> 38:28.173
you two don't strike me
as a match.

38:28.206 --> 38:32.377
Yes, but, her putz...

38:34.245 --> 38:35.980
It's like a velvet glove.

38:35.980 --> 38:39.050
[laughs]
Well...

38:39.083 --> 38:40.985
The pool party, guy.

38:40.985 --> 38:42.086
Huh?

38:42.120 --> 38:43.721
Guy...

38:43.755 --> 38:47.392
Martun throws a pool party.

38:47.425 --> 38:49.661
Everyone is there.

38:49.661 --> 38:53.431
I go to take a piss
in the bedroom.

38:53.431 --> 38:55.700
She comes
out of the bathroom...

38:55.733 --> 38:56.968
Uh-oh.

38:57.001 --> 38:59.270
- Spilling out of her bikini...
- Oh.

38:59.270 --> 39:01.406
Dripping wet.

39:01.406 --> 39:03.408
What am I supposed to do?

39:03.441 --> 39:05.143
Look,
just sit her down

39:05.143 --> 39:06.644
and talk to her
like an adult.

39:06.678 --> 39:08.746
How do I talk like an adult?
She is a child.

39:08.980 --> 39:10.982
She's 20.

39:13.017 --> 39:14.152
[groans]

39:14.185 --> 39:16.421
But maybe talking...

39:16.421 --> 39:19.290
mm, maybe I talk to her.

39:19.290 --> 39:22.126
I need a harder drink
for that.

39:22.160 --> 39:24.028
Hey!
Two Arak!

39:24.028 --> 39:25.630
What?

39:25.663 --> 39:26.698
You like it, Arak?

39:26.731 --> 39:29.100
- Yeah.
- It's a real man's drink.

39:29.133 --> 39:30.535
Arak.

39:30.535 --> 39:32.370
Here we go.

39:32.403 --> 39:35.473
[chuckles]
Yeah.

39:37.308 --> 39:39.544
Mm.

39:39.577 --> 39:41.312
My friend...

39:41.312 --> 39:45.149
you and the girl, that is a road
that you need to walk alone.

39:45.183 --> 39:47.051
But as promised,

39:47.085 --> 39:50.054
the rest of your Arak
is on me.

39:50.054 --> 39:51.689
Where are you going?

39:51.723 --> 39:55.460
I think maybe I'll go do
some laundry or something.

39:55.493 --> 39:57.061
Ari, do yourself a favor.

39:57.095 --> 39:59.197
Don't kill yourself over
this Layla drama, okay?

39:59.197 --> 40:01.199
At the end of the day,

40:01.199 --> 40:03.134
it's just putz.

40:03.167 --> 40:05.470
[scoffs]

40:23.087 --> 40:25.590
[groans]

40:37.602 --> 40:39.971
[grunts]

40:41.472 --> 40:44.008
Aah!

41:17.241 --> 41:20.511
[line trilling]

41:20.511 --> 41:22.981
(Briggs on phone)
Yeah. Ari, what's up, man?

41:22.981 --> 41:25.249
Something bad
has happened, guy.

41:25.249 --> 41:27.752
- Really?
- I need you to come here.

41:27.986 --> 41:30.455
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll be right over.

42:06.157 --> 42:08.526
[dog barking]
