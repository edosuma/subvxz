WEBVTT

01:44.250 --> 01:46.458
<i>- Surely it's a hearing,</i>
<i>not a trial.</i>

01:46.541 --> 01:48.458
- It is true, there will be
no jury to persuade,

01:48.541 --> 01:49.625
only a judge.

01:49.708 --> 01:51.583
- But if the judge finds
that you should go for trial,

01:51.666 --> 01:52.958
then that will not augur well.

01:53.041 --> 01:54.166
So if we lose at this stage,

01:54.250 --> 01:55.458
then we are likely
to lose again.

01:55.541 --> 01:57.500
- Things do not look good.
- Who's side are you on?

01:57.583 --> 01:59.500
- Our job
is to prepare Mr. Russell

01:59.583 --> 02:01.500
for the questions
he will be asked.

02:01.583 --> 02:03.791
- Now, what else is there
to know about Dixon?

02:03.875 --> 02:05.250
Have we looked
under every rock?

02:05.333 --> 02:06.708
- I'm not sure
what there is to say.

02:06.791 --> 02:08.875
He leads the team
that built the engine.

02:08.958 --> 02:10.250
A classic middle manager.

02:10.333 --> 02:12.083
- Has he been living
above his means?

02:12.166 --> 02:13.541
Has he been stealing
to pay for it?

02:13.625 --> 02:15.750
There must be other frauds
hidden in his figures.

02:15.833 --> 02:18.041
- They haven't found
anything yet.

02:18.125 --> 02:19.500
- But you've looked
through his bank statements?

02:19.583 --> 02:22.166
- It cost a bit of money,
but we have.

02:22.250 --> 02:23.958
- So the long and the short
of it is,

02:24.041 --> 02:26.875
you are all here
to represent my interests,

02:26.958 --> 02:29.291
but you have come up
with absolutely nothing!

02:31.458 --> 02:32.666
Put more detectives on it.

02:32.750 --> 02:35.375
Talk to Pinkerton himself.
Do whatever it takes.

02:35.458 --> 02:38.041
But you must give me something
to work with.

02:46.750 --> 02:48.750
- Monsieur, quick.
She's on her way there now.

02:48.833 --> 02:50.750
- Where is Mr. Church?
- I'm here. What is it?

02:50.833 --> 02:52.416
- The mistress is on her way
to the ballroom.

02:52.500 --> 02:54.625
- She's ten minutes early.
- I can't help that.

02:54.708 --> 02:56.291
Come on.

02:56.375 --> 02:58.375
- We'll take out the piano
and build the podium

02:58.458 --> 02:59.791
for the band in this alcove.

02:59.875 --> 03:00.916
Who will make that?

03:01.000 --> 03:02.583
- It's already made
and stored in the basement.

03:02.666 --> 03:03.750
See it's set up
while we're away.

03:03.833 --> 03:04.750
Yes, ma'am.

03:04.833 --> 03:06.083
- Now, we'll be in Newport
for ten days.

03:06.166 --> 03:07.875
And when I get back,
I want to see the menus

03:07.958 --> 03:09.000
for the buffet supper
at midnight

03:09.083 --> 03:10.458
and breakfast for the stayers
at 6:00.

03:10.541 --> 03:11.666
I'll have them ready.

03:11.750 --> 03:14.875
- Church,
do you have any questions?

03:14.958 --> 03:16.833
- Everything's under control,
ma'am.

03:16.916 --> 03:18.000
- And the dresses
for the quadrille?

03:18.083 --> 03:19.083
I'm managing that.

03:19.166 --> 03:20.375
- Won't the girls need
fittings?

03:20.458 --> 03:22.666
- Of course, but don't worry.
I've written to their mothers.

03:22.750 --> 03:24.166
That's all for now.

03:24.250 --> 03:26.000
Very good, ma'am.

03:26.083 --> 03:27.416
- What about my dress
to change into

03:27.500 --> 03:29.250
- when the quadrille is done?
- What about it?

03:29.333 --> 03:30.583
- Don't you want to know
what I'd like?

03:30.666 --> 03:31.958
- No need.
It's already ordered.

03:32.041 --> 03:33.250
They have your measurements,
and they'll fit it

03:33.333 --> 03:34.833
when we're back in New York.

03:36.833 --> 03:38.125
I know Mrs. Fish.

03:38.208 --> 03:39.958
Why don't I propose myself
and join you there?

03:40.041 --> 03:41.166
She won't mind.

03:42.541 --> 03:44.125
Wouldn't you like me to come?

03:44.208 --> 03:45.458
Of course.

03:45.541 --> 03:47.166
I should get started,
or we'll miss the train

03:47.250 --> 03:49.041
she wants us to catch.

03:49.125 --> 03:51.750
What's the matter?

03:51.833 --> 03:53.916
- Larry Russell told me
that his mother and sister

03:54.000 --> 03:56.458
are going to be in Newport
at the same time as me.

03:56.541 --> 03:58.291
- So you're still determined
on her?

03:58.375 --> 03:59.750
I am.

03:59.833 --> 04:02.583
And bumping into her
at Newport would be perfect.

04:02.666 --> 04:05.250
John, be reasonable.

04:05.333 --> 04:06.500
What did you think
would happen?

04:06.583 --> 04:08.750
- That doesn't mean
that I want it to happen.

04:08.833 --> 04:10.416
I want what's best for you.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.000
And you should want
what's best for me.

04:12.083 --> 04:13.541
- The difference is,
I love you.

04:13.625 --> 04:16.000
For Christ's sake.

04:16.083 --> 04:17.875
- Where do you think we are?
- But I do.

04:17.958 --> 04:20.208
And I don't see why we can't
just carry on as before.

04:20.291 --> 04:21.875
- Because I don't have
enough money

04:21.958 --> 04:23.666
for the way I want to live.

04:23.750 --> 04:26.041
And because behavior
which attracts no gossip

04:26.125 --> 04:28.333
in the young man
starts to make people wonder

04:28.416 --> 04:30.166
as we get older.

04:31.750 --> 04:34.125
I can't have that.

04:34.208 --> 04:35.916
Are you finished, messieurs?

04:37.416 --> 04:39.500
Yes. I think we probably are.

04:46.166 --> 04:47.458
Where's Mr. Bannister?

04:47.541 --> 04:48.958
In the dining room.

04:49.041 --> 04:50.791
- Do you think he might let me
go early today?

04:50.875 --> 04:52.041
I doubt it.

04:52.125 --> 04:55.416
An afternoon off means
an afternoon off.

05:02.791 --> 05:04.208
Cousin Oscar.

05:04.291 --> 05:06.875
- Are you here for luncheon?
- I had an early lunch.

05:06.958 --> 05:08.833
- I just looked in to see Mama.
- Oh.

05:08.916 --> 05:10.416
- Larry Russell and I
are catching

05:10.500 --> 05:11.833
the ferry and train to Newport.

05:11.916 --> 05:13.958
- Well,
I'll come and see you off.

05:17.958 --> 05:19.166
Good day, Mr. Russell.

05:19.250 --> 05:21.500
- Hello, Miss Brook.
It's nice to see you.

05:21.583 --> 05:23.291
But I'm afraid I must tear
your cousin away

05:23.375 --> 05:24.458
or we'll be late.

05:24.541 --> 05:25.541
- I gather
you're off to Newport?

05:25.625 --> 05:26.625
Father can't get away,

05:26.708 --> 05:28.083
but Oscar and I are joining
Mrs. Fish,

05:28.166 --> 05:29.958
while Mother and Gladys
are coming tomorrow

05:30.041 --> 05:31.708
- to stay with the McAllisters.
- Mr. Larry.

05:31.791 --> 05:33.666
Mr. Clay sent these papers
for Mr. Russell.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.916
It's important that he have them
as soon as possible.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.541
I'll see that he gets them.

05:40.166 --> 05:42.416
- Who was that?
- My father's stenographer.

05:42.500 --> 05:44.416
She helps his secretary,
Mr. Clay.

05:44.500 --> 05:46.625
Let me just give these
to Church.

05:48.750 --> 05:50.625
- Did you know Gladys
was going to be there

05:50.708 --> 05:52.250
when you accepted?

05:52.333 --> 05:54.583
I can't remember.

05:54.666 --> 05:55.833
Thank you.

05:58.833 --> 06:01.583
- Mind you look after
your sister.

06:01.666 --> 06:04.041
- You're right.
Oscar's a determined suitor.

06:04.125 --> 06:05.250
But he'll have to get past
my mother,

06:05.333 --> 06:07.208
and he'll need all this tricks
to do that.

06:07.291 --> 06:09.083
- I can believe it.
Have a good time.

06:09.166 --> 06:10.541
Miss Brook.

06:14.333 --> 06:16.125
- So it's beautiful there,
no matter what.

06:16.208 --> 06:18.250
- Aurora,
when did you get here?

06:18.333 --> 06:19.500
One minute ago.

06:19.583 --> 06:21.625
- Aurora's going
to Newport tomorrow.

06:21.708 --> 06:23.375
Oh, how funny.

06:23.458 --> 06:26.250
I've just been talking about
Newport with Larry Russell.

06:26.333 --> 06:28.791
He and Oscar are on their way
to stay with Mrs. Fish.

06:28.875 --> 06:31.083
- Why does everyone have to go
to Newport now?

06:31.166 --> 06:32.958
What's wrong
with Saratoga Springs?

06:33.041 --> 06:34.625
It was very fashionable
when I was a bride.

06:34.708 --> 06:36.125
Exactly.

06:36.208 --> 06:38.250
- Every summer we talk
about taking a house there,

06:38.333 --> 06:39.583
but we never do.

06:39.666 --> 06:42.166
And now Mr. McAllister's
asked me up for ten days.

06:42.250 --> 06:45.458
- You can't be going alone
to stay with Mr. McAllister?

06:45.541 --> 06:47.958
- I'd be safe as brandy
if I were.

06:49.458 --> 06:50.625
Even so.

06:50.708 --> 06:52.583
- Larry told me he's invited
Mrs. Russell and her daughter.

06:52.666 --> 06:53.916
Must I hear of the Russells

06:54.000 --> 06:55.708
in every sentence
anyone utters?

06:55.791 --> 06:57.666
- And Mrs. McAllister
will be there.

06:57.750 --> 06:59.625
Has Mrs. Russell accepted?

06:59.708 --> 07:00.833
Can you doubt it?

07:00.916 --> 07:02.250
She's muscling into New York.

07:02.333 --> 07:04.708
She was bound to jam her foot
in the door of Newport.

07:04.791 --> 07:07.208
- Mrs. Astor has finished
renovating Beechwood,

07:07.291 --> 07:09.000
so she'll be spending
her summers there

07:09.083 --> 07:11.166
- from now on.
- How do you know?

07:11.250 --> 07:13.500
I do read the papers, Agnes.

07:13.583 --> 07:15.291
I don't live at the bottom
of an oubliette.

07:15.375 --> 07:17.833
You just talk as if you do.

07:17.916 --> 07:19.583
Are you staying for luncheon,
my dear?

07:19.666 --> 07:21.291
I can't, Aunt Agnes.

07:24.750 --> 07:26.416
- I've told John
he can leave early,

07:26.500 --> 07:27.958
so I'll be dealing
with the coffee.

07:28.041 --> 07:30.791
- You might ask John for
some tips on how he served it

07:30.875 --> 07:32.500
when he took over
from you that time.

07:32.583 --> 07:34.791
He managed things
so efficiently.

07:34.875 --> 07:36.375
Yes, ma'am.

07:36.458 --> 07:38.125
All our staff seem to have

07:38.208 --> 07:39.833
pressing engagements
outside this house.

07:39.916 --> 07:42.041
- Servants must have a life,
Aunt Agnes.

07:42.125 --> 07:43.375
Why?

07:43.458 --> 07:44.875
Marian?

07:46.291 --> 07:47.375
What is it?

07:47.458 --> 07:49.250
- I don't want to be one
of those awful best friends

07:49.333 --> 07:51.375
who delights in bringing
unwelcome news.

07:51.458 --> 07:53.375
Go on.

07:53.458 --> 07:55.916
- I worry about
your Mr. Raikes.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.416
- He isn't "my" Mr. Raikes,
exactly.

07:58.500 --> 08:00.875
- Well, if it isn't,
then I'm glad.

08:00.958 --> 08:02.500
He seems to be everywhere
these days.

08:02.583 --> 08:04.041
You know,
we were in the same party

08:04.125 --> 08:05.500
when Edison turned on
his lights.

08:05.583 --> 08:06.791
He told me.

08:08.125 --> 08:10.000
I just worry for you.

08:10.083 --> 08:12.500
- Please don't.
- Marian, are you coming?

08:12.583 --> 08:13.708
Now I'd better go in.

08:13.791 --> 08:15.791
I'll see you when you get back
from Newport.

08:15.875 --> 08:17.291
Enjoy yourself.

08:24.333 --> 08:26.750
- Put it there,
and be off with you.

08:26.833 --> 08:28.583
- Mr. Bannister says
he'll manage the coffee.

08:28.666 --> 08:30.791
- Where are you going?
- Nowhere in particular.

08:30.875 --> 08:32.083
I should get changed.

08:40.000 --> 08:40.916
Why would he have flowers

08:41.000 --> 08:42.250
if he's not going
anywhere special?

08:42.333 --> 08:43.875
- Can you explain that?
- I can.

08:43.958 --> 08:45.208
He's not telling the truth.

08:45.291 --> 08:46.666
But it's his business,
not ours.

08:46.750 --> 08:48.583
So we leave him to it.

08:48.666 --> 08:50.375
Thank you.

08:50.458 --> 08:51.500
- What's he doing
in the basement

08:51.583 --> 08:53.583
if he's come to call?

08:53.666 --> 08:55.250
Bridget can help you.

08:59.125 --> 09:00.541
Is Miss Scott anywhere about?

09:00.625 --> 09:02.250
- Oh, you're here
for Miss Scott?

09:02.333 --> 09:03.666
She's upstairs in her room.

09:03.750 --> 09:06.291
Ah, can you give her this?

09:06.375 --> 09:08.333
Tell her Mr. Raikes left it.

09:08.416 --> 09:10.583
I'm in a hurry now.
But say I can discuss it later.

09:10.666 --> 09:12.875
- I'll take it, sir.
- Oh, thank you.

09:14.166 --> 09:17.208
- Makes sense.
I'm going up there now.

09:21.750 --> 09:23.458
Are you busy?

09:23.541 --> 09:25.416
- What's happened?
- Nothing.

09:25.500 --> 09:28.291
- Except I think I know what
I intend to say to Mr. Raikes.

09:29.500 --> 09:30.875
Which is?

09:30.958 --> 09:32.750
Only that I'm ready.

09:32.833 --> 09:34.541
I wasn't sure before
about eloping,

09:34.625 --> 09:38.208
but Tom thinks that Aunt Agnes
will never come round until

09:38.291 --> 09:39.875
after the wedding.

09:39.958 --> 09:42.708
- I'm happy
if it's what you want.

09:42.791 --> 09:45.666
I'm surrounded by doubters.

09:45.750 --> 09:47.500
Aunt Agnes, Aurora Fane.

09:47.583 --> 09:49.625
The only way to silence them
is just to get married

09:49.708 --> 09:50.833
and have done with it.

09:50.916 --> 09:53.250
- You can't leave everything
up in the air indefinitely.

09:53.333 --> 09:54.916
At least that's a decision.

09:58.750 --> 10:01.666
Left by a Mr. Raikes.

10:01.750 --> 10:03.791
Do you think it's a sign?

10:03.875 --> 10:05.291
Thank you.

10:12.333 --> 10:14.166
- Gentlemen!

10:14.250 --> 10:17.666
Do not swing the women around
like sacks of hay.

10:24.166 --> 10:25.750
- How long will you be
in Newport?

10:25.833 --> 10:27.416
Ten days.

10:27.500 --> 10:29.125
I'll see you then.

10:29.208 --> 10:30.166
I get there next Friday

10:30.250 --> 10:31.541
and stay till the end
of the season.

10:31.625 --> 10:33.208
- And there'll be plenty
of time to practice this

10:33.291 --> 10:35.125
when we're both back.

10:35.208 --> 10:36.375
Remember, everyone.

10:36.458 --> 10:38.708
The quadrille is not
a romping dance.

10:38.791 --> 10:39.875
Again, please.

10:39.958 --> 10:41.708
- You'll have to finish now,
I'm afraid, Mr. Vaughn.

10:41.791 --> 10:42.833
We're leaving first thing
in the morning,

10:42.916 --> 10:44.541
and Gladys has still
all her packing to do.

10:44.625 --> 10:46.208
- Only because
you've commandeered my maid.

10:46.291 --> 10:47.750
She's in your room now.

10:47.833 --> 10:49.208
When you get back,
we'll organize fittings

10:49.291 --> 10:50.541
for your dresses
for the quadrille.

10:50.625 --> 10:52.333
- I've chosen the design.
- Has my mother agreed?

10:52.416 --> 10:54.166
- The costumes would be
a present to you all.

10:55.708 --> 10:57.166
Yes, you could.

10:57.250 --> 10:58.791
Carrie gave us the idea
for the quadrille

10:58.875 --> 10:59.958
in the first place.

11:00.041 --> 11:01.541
And the rest of you
are so good to join in.

11:01.625 --> 11:03.000
- Please.
- Well, if you're sure.

11:03.083 --> 11:05.166
- I am. And now I'll come
and see you out.

11:05.250 --> 11:07.166
- Good day, Mrs. Russell.
- Thank you, Mrs. Russell.

11:08.458 --> 11:09.958
- It's a shame
we'll all be gone at once.

11:10.041 --> 11:11.333
I wish Larry could have stayed.

11:11.416 --> 11:12.958
I'm concerned about Father.

11:13.041 --> 11:14.375
Will he manage
while we're away?

11:14.458 --> 11:15.958
He'll do more than manage.

11:16.041 --> 11:17.541
- Only,
he looked worried earlier.

11:17.625 --> 11:18.750
He wasn't worried.

11:18.833 --> 11:20.333
He was just thinking
about things.

11:20.416 --> 11:22.458
- Well, he seemed to have
a great many things

11:22.541 --> 11:23.875
to think about.

11:25.041 --> 11:26.083
You're back early, John.

11:26.166 --> 11:27.833
You could have stayed out
a bit later.

11:27.916 --> 11:29.500
Did you have a nice time?

11:29.583 --> 11:31.250
Wouldn't you like to know?

11:31.333 --> 11:32.500
Where'd you go?

11:32.583 --> 11:35.041
- Somewhere I enjoy.
- You're very mysterious.

11:35.125 --> 11:36.541
Have some tea anyway.

11:36.625 --> 11:38.875
- Oh, anything but tea,
Mrs. Bauer.

11:38.958 --> 11:41.625
I'll be in my room, but knock
if you want me, Mr. Bannister.

11:44.000 --> 11:45.333
Thank you.

11:45.416 --> 11:47.041
He's hiding something.

11:47.125 --> 11:50.041
- If he is,
he's not the only one.

11:50.125 --> 11:51.666
Is he, Miss Scott?

11:54.208 --> 11:55.583
Oh, thank you.

12:01.625 --> 12:03.791
- Will Mrs. Russell need
any special arrangements

12:03.875 --> 12:05.916
- at the hearing?
- She's not coming.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.458
Tomorrow,
she leaves for Newport.

12:07.541 --> 12:09.791
- Hmm.
It's probably better.

12:09.875 --> 12:12.208
Makes it less of a story.

12:12.291 --> 12:14.416
- If this case goes forward
to trial,

12:14.500 --> 12:17.541
then all her plans
will crumble to dust.

12:17.625 --> 12:19.125
No one will come to the ball.

12:19.208 --> 12:21.208
We'll be outcasts.

12:21.291 --> 12:24.000
It doesn't worry me,
but it would worry her.

12:24.083 --> 12:26.750
- I doubt Mrs. Russell
would be sunk for long.

12:26.833 --> 12:29.166
- She'd be flattered
you have such faith in her.

12:30.708 --> 12:33.416
Is there anything new
about Dixon?

12:33.500 --> 12:35.958
- They haven't found
anything useful yet.

12:43.708 --> 12:45.250
- I'll be out of here
in a moment.

12:45.333 --> 12:47.583
- That's all right.
What was in the letter?

12:47.666 --> 12:50.500
- Good news, I hope.
- Not really, I'm afraid.

12:50.583 --> 12:53.291
- But that's not the worst part.
- What is?

12:53.375 --> 12:55.000
- I think Miss Armstrong
read the letter

12:55.083 --> 12:57.458
- before she gave it to me.
- What makes you say that?

12:57.541 --> 12:59.125
- There was
a little tear in it,

12:59.208 --> 13:02.208
and something
she said to me downstairs.

13:02.291 --> 13:04.208
- Would that be bad?
- It would not be good.

13:04.291 --> 13:06.166
What would not be good?

13:09.041 --> 13:10.625
- Miss Scott thinks
that Armstrong has read

13:10.708 --> 13:11.833
one of her letters.

13:11.916 --> 13:14.958
- She's sly enough,
that's for sure.

13:15.041 --> 13:16.500
I'll say good evening.

13:20.916 --> 13:22.958
- That was fighting talk,
Aunt Ada.

13:23.041 --> 13:24.916
I don't like Armstrong.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.625
And I never have.

13:33.541 --> 13:35.750
- Mr. Johnson is bringing
the carriage around

13:35.833 --> 13:37.541
- in ten minutes.
- They're both ready to leave.

13:37.625 --> 13:39.375
- Very well.
- Oh, good day, Mr. Bannister.

13:39.458 --> 13:41.166
- Mrs. Bruce.
Is someone on their travels?

13:41.250 --> 13:43.625
- The mistress and Miss Gladys
are on their way to Newport.

13:43.708 --> 13:44.833
Ah.

13:44.916 --> 13:48.125
I hear you're making
some changes in your household.

13:48.208 --> 13:51.000
- Oh?
- Hasn't your Miss Turner left?

13:51.083 --> 13:52.166
Did you know Miss Turner?

13:52.250 --> 13:55.041
- Not well. But she wrote to me
before she went.

13:55.125 --> 13:58.291
I gather she was no great
friend to you, Mr. Church.

13:58.375 --> 13:59.625
Why? What did she say?

13:59.708 --> 14:02.958
- Oh, nothing to be
worried about.

14:03.041 --> 14:04.750
Oh, well, not today.

14:06.875 --> 14:08.083
Oh, look.

14:08.166 --> 14:10.416
Isn't that your chef?
Monsieur...

14:10.500 --> 14:12.083
- Monsieur Baudin.
Yes, it is.

14:13.750 --> 14:15.125
Good day, Mr. Bannister.

14:16.250 --> 14:18.041
Good day, Mr. Bannister.

14:51.208 --> 14:52.625
- Mrs. McNeil
would like to know

14:52.708 --> 14:55.375
if there's something
you wish to ask of her?

14:55.458 --> 14:56.583
Why do you say that?

14:56.666 --> 14:58.125
She's seen you here before.

15:11.166 --> 15:12.750
- Is there something
I can help you with?

15:14.166 --> 15:16.958
I've noticed you watching me.

15:17.041 --> 15:18.541
You don't know me?

15:19.958 --> 15:21.541
Should I?

15:21.625 --> 15:23.458
Mister...

15:23.541 --> 15:24.625
Collyer.

15:30.958 --> 15:32.916
Flora.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.000
Welcome back, Mrs. McNeil.

15:40.500 --> 15:42.625
This is a surprise.

15:42.708 --> 15:45.166
- A pleasant one, I hope.
- Very pleasant.

15:45.250 --> 15:46.291
What brings you here?

15:46.375 --> 15:48.875
I just thought I'd look in.

15:48.958 --> 15:51.000
I want to be alone with you.

15:54.541 --> 15:56.958
- Have you thought
about what I said?

15:57.041 --> 15:59.458
At Mrs. Chamberlain's?

15:59.541 --> 16:01.666
You're right about one thing.

16:01.750 --> 16:04.208
Aunt Agnes is never
going to change.

16:04.291 --> 16:07.500
I hate to make her unhappy,
truly.

16:07.583 --> 16:08.958
But she won't change.

16:09.041 --> 16:12.208
- Not until after the wedding,
at any rate.

16:12.291 --> 16:14.000
She'll come round
when we're married.

16:14.083 --> 16:15.583
But not before.

16:17.541 --> 16:19.375
So this is the moment.

16:20.833 --> 16:23.166
- It's time to take matters
into our own hands.

16:23.250 --> 16:24.875
And elope?

16:24.958 --> 16:27.500
People have before now.

16:27.583 --> 16:29.958
- But if we elope,
won't I ruin your reputation?

16:30.041 --> 16:31.666
Won't I be an anchor
around your neck?

16:33.166 --> 16:36.083
A very nice anchor around
a very willing neck.

16:38.875 --> 16:40.666
Please, Marian.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.416
I know this is right.

16:42.500 --> 16:44.458
Just as I know
we'll regret delaying

16:44.541 --> 16:46.375
when we could have
made it happen.

17:09.416 --> 17:12.083
- You've been very busy today,
monsieur.

17:12.166 --> 17:14.875
- I want to take advantage
of the mistress' absence

17:14.958 --> 17:16.708
to do some early work
on the ball,

17:16.791 --> 17:17.958
as much as I'm able.

17:18.041 --> 17:19.875
- Very wise,
with only the master left

17:19.958 --> 17:22.458
- in the house to feed.
- He's no trouble.

17:22.541 --> 17:25.250
He'd eat anything
that's put in front of him.

17:25.333 --> 17:27.458
- But everything's all right
otherwise?

17:27.541 --> 17:28.791
Why do you ask?

17:28.875 --> 17:31.958
- Only that I saw you
this morning in the streets.

17:32.041 --> 17:35.166
You seemed to be having
an argument of some sort.

17:37.541 --> 17:39.125
I was.

17:39.208 --> 17:41.916
- Aren't you going to tell us
what it was about, monsieur?

17:45.833 --> 17:47.208
No.

17:51.375 --> 17:53.125
I'm going to bed.

18:00.833 --> 18:01.958
<i>This is so charming.</i>

18:02.041 --> 18:03.166
<i>How long have you been</i>
<i>coming here?</i>

18:03.250 --> 18:05.958
- We have been hiding
in Bayside Farm

18:06.041 --> 18:08.375
for 20 years at least.

18:08.458 --> 18:11.208
But now New York is coming out
to find us.

18:11.291 --> 18:13.750
- Oh, I suppose they're
snapping up all the best lots.

18:13.833 --> 18:16.208
- There are still some
on Bellevue Avenue,

18:16.291 --> 18:17.958
which I would recommend.

18:18.041 --> 18:20.291
- I gather Mrs. Astor
has finished Beechwood.

18:20.375 --> 18:21.833
That was a good buy.

18:21.916 --> 18:23.708
She didn't have
to tear it down.

18:23.791 --> 18:26.458
Just add a wing
and tidy it a little.

18:26.541 --> 18:27.833
- I should love to see
the house.

18:27.916 --> 18:29.458
I'm afraid she isn't in town.

18:29.541 --> 18:31.875
- What do you do all day?
What's the life here?

18:31.958 --> 18:33.291
It's much like New York,

18:33.375 --> 18:35.541
but with sun and sea
for a background.

18:35.625 --> 18:38.375
- The young go to the casino
and play tennis.

18:38.458 --> 18:39.583
Can we follow them there?

18:39.666 --> 18:40.791
You'd like that,
wouldn't you, Gladys?

18:40.875 --> 18:42.125
- We might see Larry.
- Mm-hmm.

18:42.208 --> 18:45.625
- Of course, your son
is staying with Mrs. Fish.

18:45.708 --> 18:47.916
- Do you know her well?
- I don't know her at all.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.875
But Larry's stayed there
a few times.

18:49.958 --> 18:51.208
That may be helpful.

18:51.291 --> 18:53.000
We'll go
to the casino tomorrow.

18:53.083 --> 18:55.875
I'll ask Mrs. Fish
when she's taking her party.

18:55.958 --> 18:58.333
- Mrs. Fish will only change
the plan ten times

18:58.416 --> 19:00.208
- and wreck the afternoon.

19:00.291 --> 19:03.750
Then, my dear,
we must persevere.

19:09.458 --> 19:10.666
I'll be quick.

19:10.750 --> 19:11.916
Take your time, dear.

19:24.250 --> 19:26.166
- What do you have in fawn?
- Oh, no.

19:26.250 --> 19:28.208
Pardon me, miss?

19:28.291 --> 19:31.666
- Excuse me? I can return it
to her if it's helpful.

19:31.750 --> 19:32.750
Do you know Mrs. Dixon?

19:32.833 --> 19:34.708
- Well, no, but I know
where her employer lives.

19:34.791 --> 19:36.083
- That's very kind of you,
miss.

19:36.166 --> 19:37.625
Not at all.

19:37.708 --> 19:40.750
Now, I'll have
two pairs of those, please.

19:40.833 --> 19:43.291
Size seven.
I'll take them with me now.

19:43.375 --> 19:44.625
I have to look into
the Russell's house

19:44.708 --> 19:45.916
when we get back.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.750
- Don't wait for me.
- I won't.

19:47.833 --> 19:50.833
And I won't tell Agnes either.

19:52.666 --> 19:54.208
If you could give it
to Mrs. Dixon?

19:54.291 --> 19:55.833
Mrs. Dixon?

19:55.916 --> 19:58.166
- Hello, Miss Brook.
Can I help?

19:58.250 --> 20:00.208
- I just wanted to drop
this off for Mrs. Dixon.

20:00.291 --> 20:01.375
Or is it Miss?

20:01.458 --> 20:03.041
She left it on the counter
in Bloomingdale's,

20:03.125 --> 20:04.583
and I was behind her in line.

20:04.666 --> 20:05.708
The assistant
tried to find her,

20:05.791 --> 20:06.916
but she was too late.

20:07.000 --> 20:09.208
- Mrs. Dixon?
- Your stenographer.

20:09.291 --> 20:11.291
I met her when she brought
some papers for you

20:11.375 --> 20:12.291
and gave them to Larry.

20:12.375 --> 20:14.458
She said
you had to see them at once.

20:14.541 --> 20:17.125
- I know. It was just as Larry
was leaving for Newport.

20:17.208 --> 20:19.000
You must mean Miss Ainsley.

20:19.083 --> 20:20.458
- She'd bought some gloves,
and I suppose,

20:20.541 --> 20:22.500
had charged them
to the name Dixon.

20:22.583 --> 20:25.083
I'm sorry to bother you
with it.

20:25.166 --> 20:27.083
- You haven't bothered me
at all.

20:27.166 --> 20:29.083
Quite the reverse.

20:29.166 --> 20:30.708
Goodbye and thank you,
Miss Brook.

20:33.375 --> 20:34.833
Thank you, Church.

20:41.250 --> 20:42.875
- Is it
Jack's afternoon off again?

20:42.958 --> 20:45.583
- He has one a week.
Same as us.

20:45.666 --> 20:47.833
- I think he's bought flowers
just like the last time.

20:47.916 --> 20:49.250
He hid them
when he went up to serve.

20:49.333 --> 20:52.125
You're not being fair.

20:52.208 --> 20:54.166
- Let me follow him.
- What?

20:54.250 --> 20:55.500
You can tell Mr. Bannister

20:55.583 --> 20:56.875
that I'm running some errands
for you.

20:56.958 --> 20:58.625
- Oh, you're only interested
in Jack

20:58.708 --> 21:00.875
because he's found
someone else.

21:00.958 --> 21:03.000
- Come on.
You know you're curious.

21:03.083 --> 21:04.541
You're not to spoil his fun.

21:04.625 --> 21:06.666
He's entitled to visit
another young lady.

21:06.750 --> 21:08.500
What would you say
if he sees you?

21:08.583 --> 21:10.125
I'll think of something.

21:11.583 --> 21:13.416
- Go on, then.
Fetch your coat.

21:16.041 --> 21:18.541
- This is the last of it, so
I'll be off if you don't mind.

21:18.625 --> 21:21.625
- What does Mr. Bannister say?
- I've said he's to go.

21:21.708 --> 21:23.291
I'll just get changed.

21:25.041 --> 21:27.083
- Is she talking to you yet?
- It depends.

21:27.166 --> 21:28.791
Sometimes she speaks
to Miss Ada,

21:28.875 --> 21:30.250
and Miss Ada speaks to me.

21:30.333 --> 21:31.750
This too will pass.

21:57.416 --> 21:59.208
- Shall I go?
- No.

21:59.291 --> 22:02.708
You know that I bring my dollar
every week to Miss Ada.

22:02.791 --> 22:04.583
Thank you, Mrs. Bauer.

22:04.666 --> 22:07.250
I hope it's not too great
an inconvenience.

22:11.083 --> 22:12.500
Is there something else?

22:12.583 --> 22:14.166
I may be wrong, ma'am.

22:14.250 --> 22:16.250
But I think
Miss Armstrong is planning

22:16.333 --> 22:18.916
to do a disservice
to Miss Scott.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.541
You do not surprise me.

22:20.625 --> 22:22.625
- I don't know
what she's got planned.

22:22.708 --> 22:25.125
But it makes her smile
to think about it.

22:25.208 --> 22:26.916
I thought I should
let you know.

22:27.000 --> 22:27.958
Thank you.

22:30.375 --> 22:32.083
Can you think
what that might be?

22:32.166 --> 22:33.958
I have a suspicion, yes.

22:34.041 --> 22:36.416
- Then warn Miss Scott
if you can.

22:42.750 --> 22:44.666
- She's been hinting
since she read the letter

22:44.750 --> 22:46.083
that she knows enough
of my story now

22:46.166 --> 22:47.750
to make things
difficult for me.

22:47.833 --> 22:50.375
It means she's planning to tell
Mrs. Van Rhijn.

22:50.458 --> 22:53.125
- Mrs. Bauer said much
the same thing to Aunt Ada.

22:55.166 --> 22:58.708
But what about your story
is so terrible?

23:01.708 --> 23:03.166
All right.

23:04.875 --> 23:06.875
You've waited long enough.

23:12.875 --> 23:16.083
I told you a man called
Elias Finn changed my life.

23:16.166 --> 23:18.458
Yes.

23:18.541 --> 23:21.500
- I didn't tell you
that I was his wife.

23:21.583 --> 23:23.291
And the mother of our child.

23:23.375 --> 23:25.750
What? You have a child?

23:25.833 --> 23:27.625
I had a child.

23:27.708 --> 23:29.750
A son.

23:31.750 --> 23:34.625
In fact, I nearly died
in childbirth.

23:34.708 --> 23:36.791
But when
I finally came round...

23:38.333 --> 23:42.166
He was already dead.

23:42.250 --> 23:44.666
After that, my father
took me back to New York.

23:44.750 --> 23:46.666
So this didn't happen here?

23:46.750 --> 23:48.000
No.

23:48.083 --> 23:50.291
I met Elias in Brooklyn.

23:50.375 --> 23:52.500
But my father didn't approve.

23:52.583 --> 23:57.333
For him, Elias had no prospects
and was uneducated.

23:57.416 --> 24:00.625
So when I saw it was hopeless,
we left for Philadelphia.

24:00.708 --> 24:03.916
By the time my father found us,
I was married and pregnant.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.750
Are you still married?

24:05.833 --> 24:07.500
No.

24:07.583 --> 24:10.416
My father bullied Elias
into signing a paper

24:10.500 --> 24:12.625
saying he'd been married before.

24:12.708 --> 24:15.125
Then he got a judge to declare
our marriage void.

24:15.208 --> 24:16.250
Why would he do that?

24:16.333 --> 24:18.625
Did he really prefer you
to be an unwed mother?

24:18.708 --> 24:21.541
Maybe he wasn't
thinking straight.

24:21.625 --> 24:23.041
Either way, he brought me home,

24:23.125 --> 24:26.208
and I was told to forget
it ever happened--

24:26.291 --> 24:28.333
to forget my own child.

24:33.291 --> 24:35.041
How could you?

24:35.125 --> 24:36.583
I tried.

24:36.666 --> 24:38.541
For a year or more.

24:38.625 --> 24:40.833
But in the end,
that's why I went back--

24:40.916 --> 24:42.333
to find the midwife.

24:42.416 --> 24:45.166
I needed to know more
about my boy.

24:46.791 --> 24:49.125
I was told she moved
to Doylestown,

24:49.208 --> 24:51.500
but I couldn't find her there.

24:51.583 --> 24:56.000
So I went
to the railway station.

24:56.083 --> 24:58.666
And I met a young lady
who lost her ticket.

24:58.750 --> 25:01.708
And now I've shocked that same
young lady out of her senses.

25:01.791 --> 25:04.125
I'm not shocked.

25:05.666 --> 25:08.500
I'm sad.

25:08.583 --> 25:11.416
Much more than sad.

25:11.500 --> 25:13.750
And I understand why
you needed Mr. Raikes.

25:13.833 --> 25:16.125
But he can't have written
all that in his letter.

25:16.208 --> 25:18.041
He wrote enough.

25:18.125 --> 25:19.250
It was to tell me

25:19.333 --> 25:21.875
that he couldn't trace
the midwife either.

25:21.958 --> 25:23.583
Miss Armstrong
may be many things,

25:23.666 --> 25:25.958
but she's not stupid.

25:27.583 --> 25:29.708
I wish you'd said this sooner.

25:33.333 --> 25:35.500
- There's only one thing
to be done.

25:37.250 --> 25:38.875
You're going to tell
Aunt Agnes.

25:38.958 --> 25:42.083
- What? When?
- Tonight.

25:42.166 --> 25:45.375
We don't know if Armstrong
has said anything yet.

25:45.458 --> 25:48.625
But either way,
she has to hear it from you.

25:50.708 --> 25:53.166
- So I suppose
this is goodbye.

25:55.166 --> 25:56.833
We'll see.

26:05.541 --> 26:06.583
Ready.

26:06.666 --> 26:09.291
- Oh! I'm sorry.
- Great game, Gladys.

26:12.875 --> 26:15.041
- Why aren't
the rest of you playing?

26:15.125 --> 26:17.250
- I expect
they're enjoying the sun.

26:17.333 --> 26:20.125
- Nobody talks about anything
else but enjoying themselves.

26:20.208 --> 26:21.416
- Isn't that
what we're here for?

26:21.500 --> 26:23.083
- Not me.

26:23.166 --> 26:26.708
Dear Mrs. Fish,
you're so contrary.

26:26.791 --> 26:29.208
- How's your husband doing,
Mrs. Russell?

26:29.291 --> 26:30.333
I'm sorry?

26:30.416 --> 26:31.791
- Aren't they putting him
on trial

26:31.875 --> 26:33.208
over that train crash?

26:33.291 --> 26:35.000
I thought that was why
he stayed in New York.

26:35.083 --> 26:37.000
- If it were,
I would have stayed with him.

26:37.083 --> 26:39.166
- Oh, so he's not in trouble?
- Not in the least.

26:39.250 --> 26:41.208
But he has too many meetings
to be able to join us.

26:41.291 --> 26:44.166
- He likes to be thorough.
- Oh, I see.

26:47.375 --> 26:49.458
Mr. Reynolds,
go and fetch me a drink...

26:49.541 --> 26:51.000
Haven't bungled it, have I?

26:51.083 --> 26:54.625
- Oh, no.
She'll like you the more.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.583
Oh.

27:01.875 --> 27:05.000
- Game to Mr. Van Rhijn
and Miss Russell.

27:05.791 --> 27:07.041
- I see you're well-practiced.

27:07.125 --> 27:09.625
- Good game, Russell.
- Hardly.

27:13.291 --> 27:14.875
- Excuse me.
Oh, yes.

27:14.958 --> 27:15.916
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

27:16.000 --> 27:17.041
Of course.

27:18.375 --> 27:19.750
- Of course it is.
I'm paying for it.

27:19.833 --> 27:22.708
- Your daughter is wonderful
at the game, Mrs. Russell.

27:22.791 --> 27:24.875
- Well, a wonderful audience.
You hit all the balls.

27:24.958 --> 27:27.083
- Mr. Van Rhijn is very quick
on his feet.

27:27.166 --> 27:29.208
- What can I say?
I like to win.

27:29.291 --> 27:30.666
Oscar.

27:30.750 --> 27:33.000
- Oh, Mr. Adams.
- Who's this?

27:33.083 --> 27:35.875
- Hello, Mrs. Fish.
Mrs. Fane.

27:35.958 --> 27:38.500
Mr. McAllister.
And...

27:38.583 --> 27:40.666
May I present Mr. John Adams?

27:40.750 --> 27:42.416
This is Mrs. George Russell.

27:42.500 --> 27:44.958
- And my son Larry Russell,
my daughter Gladys Russell.

27:45.041 --> 27:46.750
- I feel I know you both
through Oscar.

27:46.833 --> 27:48.666
He speaks so highly of you.

27:48.750 --> 27:50.208
What are you doing here?

27:50.291 --> 27:52.333
- I'm staying with the Wetmores
at Chateau-sur-Mer.

27:52.416 --> 27:54.458
I called at Mrs. Fish's house,
and they told me

27:54.541 --> 27:56.333
you were all here
at the casino.

27:56.416 --> 27:58.041
Do you know Newport well,
Miss Russell?

27:58.125 --> 27:59.958
- No, not at all.
It's our first visit.

28:00.041 --> 28:02.083
- What are you doing
for dinner?

28:02.166 --> 28:03.916
To whom was that directed?

28:04.000 --> 28:05.416
To you and your new people.

28:05.500 --> 28:07.625
- Not you, Aurora.
- I'm not invited?

28:07.708 --> 28:08.750
You're not a new person.

28:08.833 --> 28:10.791
You come and bring
Mr. Adams with you.

28:10.875 --> 28:12.458
He's not one of my party.

28:12.541 --> 28:13.875
I like the cut of his jib.

28:13.958 --> 28:15.791
Mr. Adams,
what about dinner tonight?

28:15.875 --> 28:17.750
- I don't suppose
Mrs. Wetmore would mind.

28:17.833 --> 28:19.375
Then that's settled.

28:19.458 --> 28:22.708
- I hope the plan is agreeable
to you, Mrs. Russell.

28:22.791 --> 28:24.500
- Oh, it's agreeable.
Don't you worry.

28:24.583 --> 28:27.041
- Mrs. Fish is quite right,
of course.

28:29.500 --> 28:32.291
- All right,
we'll invite Mr. Adams...

28:35.041 --> 28:36.791
- What the hell do you think
you're playing at?

28:36.875 --> 28:39.416
- I think I'm playing
at having a lovely time.

28:41.541 --> 28:44.958
Dear Miss Russell,
let me help you with that.

28:59.500 --> 29:00.416
- Mr. Russell.
- Good day, sir.

29:00.500 --> 29:02.333
Right this way.

29:02.416 --> 29:04.541
- I will make no judgement
on what conclusions

29:04.625 --> 29:07.208
I may have reached,
as they are irrelevant.

29:07.291 --> 29:09.166
I must only consider
whether or not

29:09.250 --> 29:11.583
there is sufficient evidence
for the matter to go forward

29:11.666 --> 29:13.000
to a trial.

29:16.083 --> 29:19.666
- Is something the matter?
- I beg your pardon, Your Honor.

29:19.750 --> 29:22.208
We have been waiting
for an important detail.

29:22.291 --> 29:24.041
- It is here now.
- I object, Your Honor.

29:24.125 --> 29:26.333
If there is
any further evidence,

29:26.416 --> 29:27.875
it should be presented
at trial.

29:27.958 --> 29:30.791
- Objection overruled.
- We expected it some time ago.

29:30.875 --> 29:32.416
But there has been a delay.

29:32.500 --> 29:35.458
- Is it a detail
that might affect the outcome?

29:35.541 --> 29:37.291
It may be so, Your Honor.

29:37.375 --> 29:38.958
- What is it
that you've brought to show me?

29:39.041 --> 29:40.000
It is rather a matter

29:40.083 --> 29:42.791
of whom we have brought here,
Your Honor.

29:42.875 --> 29:43.958
What happened?

29:44.041 --> 29:45.750
- I didn't think you'd need me
this afternoon, sir.

29:45.833 --> 29:48.666
And I had other business.
But I've got the papers with me.

29:48.750 --> 29:50.125
I hope I'm not too late.

29:50.208 --> 29:51.791
No, you're not too late.

29:51.875 --> 29:53.458
- I would like to introduce
Miss Ainsley,

29:53.541 --> 29:56.416
Mr. Russell's stenographer.

29:56.500 --> 29:59.416
- Mr. Russell, I don't--
- Miss Ainsley.

29:59.500 --> 30:01.000
Please.

30:01.083 --> 30:04.500
- But I--
- Get on with it, Mr. Brand.

30:04.583 --> 30:07.166
- Look around this room,
Miss Ainsley.

30:07.250 --> 30:08.708
You know Mr. Russell,
of course.

30:08.791 --> 30:10.875
Mr. Clay, Mr. Lewis,
and myself.

30:10.958 --> 30:14.333
Is there anyone else
you are familiar with?

30:15.750 --> 30:17.333
No.

30:17.416 --> 30:18.791
Mr. Dixon.

30:18.875 --> 30:20.500
Will you please stand?

30:22.916 --> 30:24.833
Do you know this man?

30:24.916 --> 30:27.166
- No.
- You're quite sure of that?

30:27.250 --> 30:28.375
Quite sure.

30:28.458 --> 30:29.833
- Then why were you
seen together

30:29.916 --> 30:32.166
in the department store,
Bloomingdale's?

30:32.250 --> 30:33.916
- That's not true.
- I think it is true.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.208
- No, it's not.
- I have it on good authority.

30:36.291 --> 30:37.916
- No, I used his charge account,
but we weren't there toge--

30:38.000 --> 30:39.416
Shut up!

30:46.666 --> 30:47.583
Move it!

30:47.666 --> 30:49.500
- Well, if you watch
where you're going!

30:56.541 --> 30:58.583
- Go back inside.
Let's go.

31:05.166 --> 31:08.875
- And when, precisely, did you
give the note to Mr. Dixon?

31:08.958 --> 31:10.541
After the crash had happened.

31:10.625 --> 31:12.041
He'd written it awhile before.

31:12.125 --> 31:13.916
But when I read it,
I could see it might be useful

31:14.000 --> 31:15.708
in the future, so I kept it.

31:15.791 --> 31:18.375
- You knew
what Dixon was doing?

31:18.458 --> 31:19.583
I guess.

31:19.666 --> 31:22.500
- This was not the first time
he had appropriated money

31:22.583 --> 31:25.458
- meant for another purpose?
- I never knew the details.

31:25.541 --> 31:29.291
- Only the fact
of his dishonesty.

31:29.375 --> 31:33.208
Why was the note
actually written?

31:33.291 --> 31:35.250
- Mrs. Russell had used
the Herter Brothers

31:35.333 --> 31:36.958
for some of the decoration
at their new house

31:37.041 --> 31:38.208
on Fifth Avenue.

31:38.291 --> 31:40.125
So Mr. Russell got an estimate
from them

31:40.208 --> 31:41.750
to renovate his office.

31:41.833 --> 31:43.791
But in the end, he thought
they were too expensive

31:43.875 --> 31:45.625
and he went elsewhere.

31:45.708 --> 31:47.250
That's one question answered.

31:47.333 --> 31:48.708
Mr. Russell.

31:50.875 --> 31:52.083
You are exonerated.

31:52.166 --> 31:55.500
You may go
with your reputation intact.

31:55.583 --> 31:57.916
Mr. Dixon and Miss Ainsley.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.916
I will be referring this matter
to the prosecutor's office.

32:01.000 --> 32:02.833
I would not be surprised
if I see you back

32:02.916 --> 32:04.833
in this court room very soon.

32:04.916 --> 32:06.458
Court dismissed.

32:09.625 --> 32:12.458
- Congratulations, Mr. Russell.

32:12.541 --> 32:14.666
- Strikes me
as the element of chance.

32:14.750 --> 32:17.166
A woman goes to buy gloves,
and disaster is averted.

32:17.250 --> 32:18.875
What if she'd chosen
a different store?

32:18.958 --> 32:21.500
- You don't need us to tell you
the importance of luck.

32:21.583 --> 32:23.458
Mr. Russell.

32:23.541 --> 32:24.625
What do you want?

32:24.708 --> 32:26.000
Only to say how sorry I am

32:26.083 --> 32:28.541
that I ever did such a thing,
Mr. Russell.

32:28.625 --> 32:30.291
- Did you think
it was right before?

32:30.375 --> 32:32.625
And now you're sorry
because you've been caught?

32:32.708 --> 32:34.541
I believe you should
go to jail, Miss Ainsley.

32:34.625 --> 32:37.500
But whether a jury
agrees with me or not,

32:37.583 --> 32:39.291
I will tell you
what I've decided

32:39.375 --> 32:41.041
would be best for you,
as a plan.

32:41.125 --> 32:43.041
- Anything you want
to ask of me.

32:43.125 --> 32:44.041
Good.

32:44.125 --> 32:46.333
I will keep abreast
of your movements.

32:46.416 --> 32:48.333
And whenever
you apply for a job

32:48.416 --> 32:50.375
above the rank
of the most menial servant,

32:50.458 --> 32:53.208
I will inform your superiors
of your history

32:53.291 --> 32:55.708
and make it impossible
for them to employ you.

32:55.791 --> 32:58.708
You may scrub floors
to earn your bread,

32:58.791 --> 33:00.958
but nothing more.

33:01.041 --> 33:02.708
You don't mean that.

33:02.791 --> 33:04.833
I think you know that I do.

34:00.125 --> 34:01.833
What are you doing here?

34:03.625 --> 34:05.791
Bridget, are you following me?

34:10.041 --> 34:11.666
Is this a joke?

34:11.750 --> 34:13.625
So you can make fun of me
back at the house?

34:13.708 --> 34:15.541
- No.
- What is it then?

34:15.625 --> 34:17.291
- Mrs. Bauer and I--

34:17.375 --> 34:19.541
we wondered who you were
taking flowers to.

34:19.625 --> 34:21.333
- Because I'd replaced you
in my fickle heart

34:21.416 --> 34:22.916
with a new girl?

34:23.000 --> 34:24.583
Something like that.

34:24.666 --> 34:27.541
Well, there she is.

34:27.625 --> 34:29.083
That's my girl.

34:33.208 --> 34:34.583
May Trotter?

34:34.666 --> 34:35.750
May Trotter.

34:35.833 --> 34:38.500
Mrs. John Trotter, to be exact.

34:38.583 --> 34:42.583
Died October 8th, 1871,
at the age of 30.

34:42.666 --> 34:44.166
My mother.

34:46.041 --> 34:47.708
She was young.

34:47.791 --> 34:49.750
What'd she die of?

34:49.833 --> 34:52.000
- She was burned to death
when I was nine.

34:52.083 --> 34:54.708
What?

34:54.791 --> 34:57.833
- Ever heard
of the Peshtigo Fire of 1871?

34:57.916 --> 35:00.000
- No.
- No.

35:00.083 --> 35:02.000
It's forgotten, really.

35:02.083 --> 35:03.833
It's the same day
as the Great Chicago Fire,

35:03.916 --> 35:05.500
and people only remember that.

35:05.583 --> 35:07.833
I've never heard of Peshtigo.

35:07.916 --> 35:09.583
It's in Wisconsin.

35:11.458 --> 35:13.500
My mother had a married sister
who lived there,

35:13.583 --> 35:15.083
and she went to see
the new baby

35:15.166 --> 35:17.458
when a forest fire
swept into town.

35:17.541 --> 35:20.000
How terrible.

35:20.083 --> 35:21.416
Were a lot of people killed?

35:21.500 --> 35:23.958
- More than 2,000--

35:24.041 --> 35:27.416
my mother, my aunt,
and the baby included.

35:27.500 --> 35:30.125
- How did they find her?
- They didn't.

35:30.208 --> 35:33.416
Most of the dead
couldn't be identified.

35:33.500 --> 35:35.916
Then who's in the grave?

35:36.000 --> 35:37.083
No one.

35:39.291 --> 35:40.916
My father filled the coffin
with her clothes

35:41.000 --> 35:43.708
and put some rocks in
for weight.

35:44.458 --> 35:46.291
He wanted somewhere he could
come to think about her.

35:46.375 --> 35:48.708
And he did, day in, day out.

35:49.958 --> 35:51.958
Spent more time here
than at home.

35:52.041 --> 35:53.916
- Where is he now?
- Dead.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.333
Five years after my mother.

35:55.416 --> 35:57.208
I was 14 for that one.

35:57.291 --> 35:59.041
Oh, Jack.

36:01.458 --> 36:03.208
I'm so sorry.

36:04.916 --> 36:07.458
- I visit every week
in the month of her birthday.

36:09.458 --> 36:11.041
Used to laugh at my old pa
for coming.

36:11.125 --> 36:13.416
But now he's gone,
and here I am.

36:15.041 --> 36:17.041
- It's funny, huh?
- Not so funny.

36:19.000 --> 36:21.041
Do you have
any brothers or sisters?

36:21.125 --> 36:23.708
- Two brothers,
but we lost touch.

36:23.791 --> 36:25.250
You must miss your pa.

36:25.333 --> 36:27.625
- Not really.
We weren't close.

36:27.708 --> 36:29.625
The last person to love me

36:29.708 --> 36:32.125
was the woman
who is not in that grave.

36:32.208 --> 36:34.708
I'm sure that isn't true.

36:34.791 --> 36:36.375
No, you aren't.

36:39.458 --> 36:41.791
Now, we should make tracks
for the ferry.

36:44.458 --> 36:46.291
I'll give you a moment.

37:01.125 --> 37:02.375
But how will I ever gavotte

37:02.458 --> 37:03.958
if I'm always thinking
about my feet?

37:04.041 --> 37:05.666
Your mother looks very gay.

37:05.750 --> 37:08.291
- She had some good news from
New York before we arrived.

37:08.375 --> 37:10.250
What's this, Mrs. Russell?

37:10.333 --> 37:11.958
Good news from New York?

37:12.041 --> 37:13.250
Has your husband got off?

37:13.333 --> 37:14.750
No, no.

37:14.833 --> 37:16.708
He just wanted to wire me
how well things are going

37:16.791 --> 37:18.416
and send his best wishes
to all of you.

37:21.833 --> 37:23.250
So tell me, Mr. McAllister.

37:23.333 --> 37:25.083
Have you persuaded her
to buy a place here?

37:25.166 --> 37:26.750
Or better still, to build one?

37:26.833 --> 37:29.291
- I can only show
Mrs. Russell the options.

37:29.375 --> 37:33.250
I would not claim to have
persuaded her to do anything.

37:33.333 --> 37:34.666
She's tenacious.

37:34.750 --> 37:36.458
I'll give her that.

37:36.541 --> 37:38.750
- Smile and take it
as a compliment.

37:38.833 --> 37:40.041
It is a compliment,

37:40.125 --> 37:42.625
if you knew the number of times
she's pretended I didn't exist.

37:42.708 --> 37:45.833
And now here I am at her table
because I'm tenacious,

37:45.916 --> 37:47.041
just as she said.

37:47.125 --> 37:48.666
And because you amuse her

37:48.750 --> 37:50.875
more than she thought
you would.

37:50.958 --> 37:53.083
How are the plans
for the ball coming along?

37:53.166 --> 37:54.166
Quite well, I think.

37:54.250 --> 37:56.125
I worry it may be too soon.

37:56.208 --> 37:59.291
- Not for Gladys.
- No, not for Gladys. For you.

37:59.375 --> 38:01.541
- Don't worry. I have a plan
of campaign in mind.

38:01.625 --> 38:03.916
- Oh, never mind that.

38:04.000 --> 38:07.291
The trick is just to nod
and say that you agree.

38:07.375 --> 38:09.458
And then everyone thinks you're
as clever as clever can be.

38:11.541 --> 38:13.291
- I think you are
as clever as clever can be.

38:13.375 --> 38:15.083
But, like all gentlemen,
you try to hide it.

38:15.166 --> 38:16.208
Why is that?

38:16.291 --> 38:17.875
- Because life's
quite serious enough

38:17.958 --> 38:19.250
without any help from me.

38:21.333 --> 38:22.375
- Your friend has
quite a way

38:22.458 --> 38:23.708
with young women,
Mr. Van Rhijn.

38:23.791 --> 38:25.416
- You're right.
They seem to be having fun.

38:25.500 --> 38:26.833
- It's all very new
for Gladys.

38:26.916 --> 38:28.208
She's only out
in this coming season,

38:28.291 --> 38:30.250
so she hasn't had time
to get bored with any of it.

38:30.333 --> 38:31.875
- Then we must
guard her closely

38:31.958 --> 38:33.041
and hope she never will.

38:33.125 --> 38:35.500
- Not too closely.
That's my job.

38:35.583 --> 38:38.041
- Mr. Russell,
you'll be a team leader.

38:38.125 --> 38:40.833
- If I'm not up to the task,
I shall blame it on you.

38:43.583 --> 38:45.041
- Larry knows
how to handle her.

38:45.125 --> 38:46.666
- He does, doesn't he?

38:46.750 --> 38:49.083
- Now, finish up
and come into the parlor.

38:49.166 --> 38:50.666
- Oh, dear.
More games.

38:50.750 --> 38:52.833
- Do you have any objections,
Mrs. Russell?

38:52.916 --> 38:54.500
Not in the least, Mrs. Fish.

38:57.666 --> 38:59.750
- Won't you change your mind
about Mrs. Russell?

38:59.833 --> 39:02.416
For me, Mama, please.

39:02.500 --> 39:04.291
Of course I can't, girl.

39:04.375 --> 39:05.916
- She's no worse
than Mrs. Jay Gould.

39:06.000 --> 39:07.500
I do not receive Mrs. Gould.

39:07.583 --> 39:09.458
I do not attend
her entertainments.

39:09.541 --> 39:12.041
- Mrs. Ogden Mills?
You go there.

39:12.125 --> 39:13.916
Carrie,

39:14.000 --> 39:16.916
Mrs. Mills was born
a Livingston.

39:17.000 --> 39:20.458
Her family have been landowners
for two centuries or more.

39:20.541 --> 39:22.583
It is not my fault
she married an upstart.

39:22.666 --> 39:25.041
Besides, her mother asked me
not to punish her for it.

39:25.125 --> 39:27.958
- And I won't.
- So why punish Mrs. Russell?

39:28.041 --> 39:30.541
She has come from nothing.

39:30.625 --> 39:32.750
And her husband is no better.

39:32.833 --> 39:34.583
- You called him
a force to be reckoned with.

39:34.666 --> 39:37.708
- Well, it does not mean
that I am obliged

39:37.791 --> 39:39.625
to sit in his wife's
drawing room.

39:39.708 --> 39:41.958
I think you're being unkind.

39:42.041 --> 39:47.083
- My dear, to be a leader means
sometimes one must be unkind.

39:47.166 --> 39:50.000
It is not a role
for the faint-hearted.

39:51.541 --> 39:53.250
Sleep well, my dear.

39:58.250 --> 39:59.458
Miss Scott,

39:59.541 --> 40:01.708
Mrs. Van Rhijn understands
you wanted to see her.

40:01.791 --> 40:03.291
- If it's convenient.
- It is.

40:03.375 --> 40:06.416
She's in the drawing room
with Miss Ada and Miss Marian.

40:06.500 --> 40:08.416
Miss Armstrong, she wondered
if you might join them

40:08.500 --> 40:10.125
in ten minutes.

40:11.375 --> 40:13.416
- Me?
- You.

40:19.333 --> 40:23.250
- And this midwife,
did she bury the child?

40:23.333 --> 40:25.000
Did anyone christen him?

40:25.083 --> 40:27.250
Oh, that poor innocent.

40:27.333 --> 40:29.666
- I don't know
because I never found her.

40:29.750 --> 40:31.375
I hoped Mr. Raikes
could help me,

40:31.458 --> 40:32.625
but he wrote and told me

40:32.708 --> 40:35.375
that he couldn't trace her
either.

40:35.458 --> 40:38.541
- So that was the letter
that Armstrong read?

40:38.625 --> 40:41.041
- Well, I was concerned--
- Silence.

40:41.125 --> 40:42.625
You'll have your turn.

40:42.708 --> 40:44.791
That was the letter.

40:44.875 --> 40:46.291
- Of course,
there is much in your story

40:46.375 --> 40:48.375
that Armstrong did not glean.

40:48.458 --> 40:51.125
She said you bore
an illegitimate child

40:51.208 --> 40:52.500
whom you then abandoned.

40:52.583 --> 40:53.791
- That's not exactly--

40:53.875 --> 40:56.458
- I find now
that you are a married mother

40:56.541 --> 40:58.125
whose child died.

41:00.541 --> 41:02.791
I've lost children.

41:02.875 --> 41:04.583
I know what that is.

41:04.666 --> 41:06.375
You do, Agnes.

41:06.458 --> 41:07.875
- And we should have every--
- Yes, yes.

41:07.958 --> 41:10.541
But now we must decide
what to do with Armstrong.

41:10.625 --> 41:13.833
- I was only trying to protect
the reputation of this house.

41:13.916 --> 41:16.208
- I could say the same.
You may go.

41:24.708 --> 41:27.166
What's to be done, Miss Scott?

41:27.250 --> 41:30.666
- With respect, ma'am,
I cannot stay here.

41:30.750 --> 41:32.500
Not now.

41:32.583 --> 41:34.875
- I'll leave tonight.
- I hope you don't mean that.

41:34.958 --> 41:36.375
I'm afraid I do.

41:36.458 --> 41:38.500
The way she treats me
downstairs

41:38.583 --> 41:40.416
makes it impossible
that I should stay.

41:40.500 --> 41:42.708
And that would only get worse.

41:42.791 --> 41:45.083
But I thank you
for your kindness.

41:45.166 --> 41:47.250
And I wish you well.

41:47.333 --> 41:49.916
- And we thank you
for your hard work.

41:50.000 --> 41:52.083
- Don't we, Agnes?
- Of course.

41:52.166 --> 41:55.416
But I do hope you'll reconsider
your decision, Miss Scott.

41:55.500 --> 41:57.583
I'll go up and pack a bag.

41:57.666 --> 42:00.750
Can I come back for the rest
of my things on another day?

42:00.833 --> 42:02.083
Certainly.

42:08.333 --> 42:10.666
Oh.

42:10.750 --> 42:14.291
Wouldn't it have been better
to lose Armstrong?

42:14.375 --> 42:16.875
And have me train a new maid

42:16.958 --> 42:19.458
in all my ways
at my time of life?

42:20.875 --> 42:23.375
Maybe Miss Scott
will change her mind.

42:23.458 --> 42:25.708
She won't.

42:25.791 --> 42:27.458
But perhaps she's right.

42:27.541 --> 42:30.291
Perhaps the time has come
for a new chapter.

42:30.375 --> 42:32.250
For all of us.

42:32.333 --> 42:34.166
How final you make that sound.

42:44.041 --> 42:47.125
- Can I persuade you to stay,
Miss Scott?

42:47.208 --> 42:49.583
- I can't.
Not the way things are.

42:49.666 --> 42:51.916
Really, Miss Ada's right.

42:52.000 --> 42:54.750
It ought to be Armstrong
who goes.

42:54.833 --> 42:58.083
Seems very feeble on my part.

42:58.166 --> 43:01.375
- Couldn't let you do that.
It would be too disruptive.

43:01.458 --> 43:03.708
I'll be just fine.

43:03.791 --> 43:06.166
- I hope we can end
on good terms.

43:06.250 --> 43:08.041
Of course.

43:08.125 --> 43:10.000
I remain very grateful
for the time

43:10.083 --> 43:12.541
you've let me spend
in this house.

43:12.625 --> 43:14.458
- You're an impressive
young woman.

43:16.416 --> 43:18.375
Not everyone will support
your ambitions,

43:18.458 --> 43:20.000
to say the least of it.

43:20.083 --> 43:23.166
But you are strong enough
to manage that.

43:23.250 --> 43:25.833
- Thank you.
I'll try to be.

43:27.291 --> 43:30.041
- And now you'd better go if you
are to catch the last ferry.

43:30.125 --> 43:32.416
Goodbye, Mrs. Van Rhijn.

43:35.083 --> 43:37.583
Goodbye, Miss Scott.

43:37.666 --> 43:39.666
And may God bless you.

43:55.625 --> 43:57.541
- How can you spend
so much time in New York

43:57.625 --> 43:59.041
when you have this
to come home to?

43:59.125 --> 44:02.375
- What can I say?
I am a social animal.

44:02.458 --> 44:05.541
- Will it change things, having
Mrs. Astor here every summer?

44:05.625 --> 44:06.875
I should have thought
it would have been

44:06.958 --> 44:08.416
a little too much
of a good thing.

44:08.500 --> 44:09.708
Amen.

44:09.791 --> 44:11.291
- I think
that will be the challenge.

44:11.375 --> 44:14.000
To make sure
New York and Newport

44:14.083 --> 44:16.166
remain distinct
in their ways of doing things.

44:16.250 --> 44:18.458
- Do you know what the Astors
paid for Beechwood?

44:18.541 --> 44:21.208
Not far short of $200,000.

44:21.291 --> 44:23.208
- I don't think
Mrs. Astor would be happy

44:23.291 --> 44:24.500
to know you've told us that.

44:24.583 --> 44:27.166
- I wish I could have seen it.
- Why?

44:27.250 --> 44:28.333
- Well,
apart from anything else,

44:28.416 --> 44:30.791
I'd like to know what you can
expect for $200,000.

44:30.875 --> 44:33.083
- Well, it's a shame
she's not here.

44:33.166 --> 44:35.750
- Why don't I take you?
We'll go this afternoon.

44:35.833 --> 44:37.750
I know the butler.
He won't mind.

44:37.833 --> 44:39.625
The legendary Mr. Hefty?

44:39.708 --> 44:41.208
I thought he stayed
in New York.

44:41.291 --> 44:44.541
- No, there's a new routine
now the house is finished.

44:44.625 --> 44:46.500
He comes out
two days ahead of her.

44:46.583 --> 44:48.750
And she's due tomorrow.
It'll be all right.

44:48.833 --> 44:51.125
- Is that wise?
- Do I have to come?

44:51.208 --> 44:52.458
- You can stay here with me,
dear.

44:52.541 --> 44:53.541
That might be better.

44:53.625 --> 44:55.375
- Shouldn't we wait
until Mrs. Astor's in town?

44:55.458 --> 44:58.083
No, it'll be simpler today.

45:00.583 --> 45:02.083
Hmm.

45:02.166 --> 45:04.541
- But shouldn't
this Miss Armstrong

45:04.625 --> 45:06.208
have been the one to go,
not you?

45:06.291 --> 45:07.541
Maybe.

45:07.625 --> 45:09.708
But Marian told me
Mrs. Van Rhijn felt

45:09.791 --> 45:12.208
she could never learn to live
without her maid.

45:12.291 --> 45:15.083
Marian?

45:15.166 --> 45:16.958
We were friends in the end.

45:18.375 --> 45:20.000
She'll miss you.

45:20.083 --> 45:22.000
Stuck in that house
with two old ladies.

45:22.083 --> 45:24.166
They're not so old.

45:24.250 --> 45:26.125
And anyway, I don't think
she'll be there much longer.

45:26.208 --> 45:27.458
She's getting married.

45:27.541 --> 45:30.416
- But what about you?
That's what I want to know.

45:30.500 --> 45:31.916
There's a lot in your future,

45:32.000 --> 45:33.958
if you'll only get out
and make it happen.

45:34.041 --> 45:35.458
I just know it.

45:35.541 --> 45:37.625
- You remind me
of Mrs. Van Rhijn.

45:37.708 --> 45:39.958
- If that's true,
then I respect her for it.

45:40.041 --> 45:41.708
But what will you do?

45:41.791 --> 45:43.833
Stay here, if you'll let me.

45:43.916 --> 45:47.083
And continue with my work
at "The Globe."

45:47.166 --> 45:49.083
- We may have a problem
with your father.

45:49.166 --> 45:50.750
I can always move out again.

45:50.833 --> 45:53.291
- No need
for fighting talk just yet.

45:53.375 --> 45:55.666
- I'll say nothing unless
he's looking for a fight.

45:55.750 --> 45:57.208
But if he is,
then I'll give him one.

45:57.291 --> 45:58.708
Perhaps, but right now,

45:58.791 --> 46:01.666
could you put down your sword
and have some coffee?

46:21.708 --> 46:24.291
- We could take a quick look
around the first floor,

46:24.375 --> 46:25.958
can't we, Hefty?

46:26.041 --> 46:29.291
Mrs. Astor wouldn't mind.

46:29.375 --> 46:31.833
You could tell her I was here
with Mrs. Fane.

46:33.458 --> 46:37.000
- If you're sure of that,
Mr. McAllister.

46:37.083 --> 46:38.416
Be my guest.

46:44.333 --> 46:46.875
- It was built
about 30 years ago

46:46.958 --> 46:49.708
for a man
called Daniel Parrish.

46:49.791 --> 46:52.750
And the year before last,
it was bought

46:52.833 --> 46:55.208
by William Backhouse Astor.

46:55.291 --> 46:58.666
Although, of course,
it was really for his wife.

46:58.750 --> 47:01.000
He's never off his yacht.

47:01.083 --> 47:03.333
- And she's never on it.

47:13.083 --> 47:15.875
- She's here.
She's come early.

47:15.958 --> 47:18.000
Oh, good Lord.

47:18.083 --> 47:19.125
Shall we go out the back?

47:19.208 --> 47:20.916
- No.
She knows you're in the house.

47:21.000 --> 47:23.083
She would have seen
your carriage.

47:23.166 --> 47:24.875
Get rid of Mrs. Russell.

47:24.958 --> 47:27.541
- Come with me.
- Uh...

47:27.625 --> 47:28.708
But--

47:29.875 --> 47:32.000
Smile.

47:35.125 --> 47:36.625
Right this way.

47:36.708 --> 47:38.291
- Oh.
- Oh.

47:38.375 --> 47:40.416
- Ma'am, please, this way.
- Sorry.

47:41.916 --> 47:43.500
Quickly.

47:45.291 --> 47:47.375
- Oh.
- Sorry.

47:49.958 --> 47:51.166
- Here we are.
- Oh.

47:51.250 --> 47:52.208
Oh!

48:01.250 --> 48:05.291
- Dear Lina, I bid you welcome
to your own house.

48:05.375 --> 48:07.791
- How nice to see you.
And you, Aurora.

48:09.208 --> 48:10.958
- I hope you approve
of my efforts.

48:11.041 --> 48:14.333
- Everything is too lovely
for any words.

48:14.416 --> 48:16.416
- You're so clever.
- Oh.
