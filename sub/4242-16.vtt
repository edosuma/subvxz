Wow, guys, what
brought this on?

02:48.927 --> 02:51.012
Well, we know this year's
nationals theme was "Vintage,"

02:51.096 --> 02:52.480
so we thought we needed
something old,

02:52.564 --> 02:54.065
but something
with a lot of energy.

02:54.132 --> 02:55.900
So we thought: disco.

02:55.967 --> 02:58.135
Absolutely. I don't know if
I ever told you guys this,

02:58.186 --> 02:59.737
but back when I was
in Glee Club,

02:59.804 --> 03:01.805
we took it all the way
to nationals with

03:01.857 --> 03:04.408

03:50.956 --> 03:53.040

03:55.527 --> 03:56.911

<i>Honestly, I don't know

04:12.594 --> 04:14.312
I feel like I'm out of ideas.

04:14.379 --> 04:15.713
Oh, let's be honest, William.

04:15.764 --> 04:17.515
You've been out of ideas
since Madonna week.

04:17.565 --> 04:19.266
Why don't you
just embrace

04:19.351 --> 04:21.601
that lazy, horribly treacly
style of teaching

04:21.687 --> 04:23.053
and assign them a famous album?

04:23.105 --> 04:24.054
I did that last year.

04:24.106 --> 04:25.556
Yes, I remember, William.

04:25.607 --> 04:27.908
<i>And your Rumours week was
a resounding success</i>

04:27.993 --> 04:29.610
in that it seemed to solve

04:29.695 --> 04:32.896
everyone's problems
for about five minutes.

04:32.948 --> 04:35.199
Now I'm not talking about
just any album, William.

04:35.250 --> 04:38.902
How about the soundtrack
that defined a generation?

04:38.954 --> 04:39.754
Wait for it.

04:39.838 --> 04:41.922
<i>Saturday Night Fever.</i>

04:42.007 --> 04:43.124
I love that album.

04:43.208 --> 04:45.075
You bet your ass
you love that album.

04:45.127 --> 04:47.044
But there's just one problem--

04:47.095 --> 04:48.462
they hate disco.

04:48.547 --> 04:50.047
But they love swag.

04:50.098 --> 04:51.048
Jean jackets!

04:51.099 --> 04:52.266
Some mattresses!

04:52.351 --> 04:54.185

I'm thrilled you got into
Defiance College

05:03.094 --> 05:05.479

but what about NYU?

05:05.564 --> 05:07.982
Kurt Hummel?
Mercedes Jones?

05:08.066 --> 05:10.368
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but I'm your biggest fan.

05:10.435 --> 05:12.436
I've been to every last one
of your performances,

05:12.487 --> 05:14.071

05:14.122 --> 05:16.874
I boycotted that one because
you two weren't Tony and Maria.

05:16.941 --> 05:18.909
Why, hello, kind sir.

I don't believe
I caught your name.

I go to Carmel High.

05:23.114 --> 05:25.466

05:25.550 --> 05:26.667
to be archenemies,

05:26.752 --> 05:29.470
but I swear,
I'm not here to spy.

05:29.554 --> 05:31.889
I want to ask your advice
about something.

05:31.956 --> 05:33.808
Our coach is
Jessie St. James.

05:40.732 --> 05:41.899
Am I clear,

05:41.966 --> 05:42.933
Yes, sir.

05:42.984 --> 05:45.269
I can't hear you!

05:45.320 --> 05:46.437
Yes, sir.

05:46.488 --> 05:48.005
God, he's awful.

05:48.073 --> 05:52.443
He's nothing compared to the
kids at school... or my parents.

05:52.494 --> 05:54.662
Do you know how
I get through it?

05:54.746 --> 05:57.364
Ever since I was a kid,
I would play this game

05:57.449 --> 05:59.700
where I'd pretend I was
a different person,

05:59.785 --> 06:02.870
the person
that I dreamed of being...

06:02.954 --> 06:04.371
the real me.

06:04.456 --> 06:07.508
I even have a different name:

06:07.592 --> 06:09.376
"Unique."

06:09.461 --> 06:11.962
I got so nervous,
I almost didn't speak
to you guys today.

06:12.013 --> 06:14.998
But then I thought,
how would Unique do it?

06:15.050 --> 06:16.467
KURT:
What about NYU?

06:16.518 --> 06:18.636
Wait, wait.

Joy. By Jean Patou.

06:23.725 --> 06:25.843
Kurt Hummel and Mercedes Jones,

06:25.894 --> 06:28.178
Unique worships
the red carpet you walk on.

06:28.230 --> 06:30.898
If you two had a love child,
it would be Unique.

06:30.982 --> 06:33.517
And Unique's grandparents would
be Andre Leon Talley

06:33.568 --> 06:36.854
and Beyoncé, because only
the best will do for Unique.

06:36.905 --> 06:38.689
Yes, fools,
it's real chinchilla!

06:38.740 --> 06:41.358
Unless you're planning on
splattering it with paint.

06:41.409 --> 06:43.494
Then it's fake.

06:43.545 --> 06:45.696
KURT: Unique sounds
like a really great person.

06:45.764 --> 06:47.131
I hope that,

06:47.198 --> 06:49.583
one day, you can build up
enough courage to be him.

06:49.668 --> 06:51.502
Actually, Unique's a "her."

06:51.553 --> 06:53.203
That's why I want
your advice.

06:53.255 --> 06:55.473
Our regionals are
this Saturday,

06:55.540 --> 06:58.542
and I want to go on stage
wearing a dress and heels.

06:58.593 --> 07:01.412
Because that's who I feel
like I am inside.

07:01.480 --> 07:02.229
Unique.

07:02.314 --> 07:03.848
Yes.

07:03.915 --> 07:05.566
What would you do?

07:07.152 --> 07:08.652
(bell ringing)

07:15.827 --> 07:17.194
Did someone steal our floor?

07:17.245 --> 07:19.914
Don't worry, we'll have it back
by the end of the week.

07:19.998 --> 07:21.832
In the meantime,
Sue has lent us her...

07:21.900 --> 07:23.751
...my very own personal,

07:23.835 --> 07:24.952
one-of-a-kind,

07:36.681 --> 07:38.415
Coach Sylvester, while we
applaud your proper use

07:38.466 --> 07:39.600
of the terminology,
we told Mr. Shue

07:39.684 --> 07:40.985
we do not support disco
in this room.

07:41.052 --> 07:41.969
Ah, but some of you do.

07:42.053 --> 07:43.487
So for this week's assignment,

07:43.555 --> 07:46.557
we are going back in time...

07:46.608 --> 07:48.776
to the songs of
"Saturday Night Fever."

07:48.860 --> 07:50.060
Come on, Mr. Shue.
That's, like,

07:50.111 --> 07:51.395
a record our parents listen to.

07:51.446 --> 07:53.531
That album, teen Solomon Grundy,

07:53.598 --> 07:56.317
is one of the best-selling
soundtracks of all time.

07:56.401 --> 07:58.903
Tony Manero's story is
your story.

07:58.954 --> 08:00.738
He's a guy who works
at a paint store,

08:00.789 --> 08:02.740
struggling to
figure out his life.

08:02.791 --> 08:04.542
And the only time
he feels sure about himself

08:04.609 --> 08:06.243
is when he's performing
on the dance floor.

08:06.294 --> 08:08.746
He has a dream.
To get out of his

08:08.797 --> 08:10.631
old neighborhood in Brooklyn
and get to New York City.

08:10.715 --> 08:13.300
And by the end of the movie,
that's what he's done.

08:13.385 --> 08:16.170
He's turned his
dream into a plan.

08:16.254 --> 08:18.088
So why the dance floor?

08:18.139 --> 08:19.890
Well, Porcelain,
because we're going to start

08:19.958 --> 08:21.258
with a dance-off.

08:21.309 --> 08:23.093
And the winner
will receive

08:23.144 --> 08:25.462
a replica of
John Travolta's iconic

08:25.513 --> 08:28.399
white polyester suit,
which I am having a cadre

Oh, I bet that's worth
a lot of money.

08:41.947 --> 08:43.864
I would totally put
that suit on... eBay.

08:43.948 --> 08:45.032
So you just want us

08:45.116 --> 08:47.201
to start dancing

08:47.285 --> 08:49.203
Uh, no, actually, Sue
and I will start us off.

08:49.287 --> 08:50.871
We actually met
with Joe and Blaine beforehand.

08:50.956 --> 08:52.373
Just get up when you're ready.

08:52.457 --> 08:55.009

11:05.807 --> 11:07.925
Mm-hmm.
I was just conferring
with my co-judge,

11:07.976 --> 11:11.895
and our three finalists
for the suit are

11:11.963 --> 11:13.147
Santana Lopez...

11:13.231 --> 11:14.481
(applause)

11:14.566 --> 11:15.298
Mercedes Jones...

11:15.350 --> 11:17.467
(cheering)
and...

11:17.519 --> 11:18.569
Finn Hudson.

11:20.105 --> 11:21.488
What?

11:21.573 --> 11:22.940
Give it up.

11:22.991 --> 11:24.908
Come on.
Yeah.

11:25.948 --> 11:25.948
+

11:28.254 --> 11:30.038
Congrats, guys.
You three are the finalists

11:30.089 --> 11:31.256
of the Saturday Night Fever
Dance Competition.

11:31.340 --> 11:32.507
Whoo!

11:32.575 --> 11:33.592
High stakes here.

11:33.676 --> 11:35.043
Which one of you
will walk away

11:35.094 --> 11:36.211
with Sue's coveted
white suit?

11:36.262 --> 11:37.178
Sounds kind of
cool to me.

11:37.246 --> 11:38.296
Oh, great.
It's yours.

11:38.381 --> 11:39.414
Can we go now?

11:39.465 --> 11:40.415
Okay, look.

11:40.466 --> 11:42.100
This isn't really about a suit.

11:42.184 --> 11:43.768
It's about living
out your dreams.

11:43.853 --> 11:45.687
Of all the seniors
in New Directions,

11:45.754 --> 11:47.439
you three have
yet to decide

11:47.523 --> 11:49.190
what it is you want to do
with your lives.

11:49.258 --> 11:50.609
So your assignment
for the week:

11:50.693 --> 11:52.760
<i>perform a song
from Saturday Night Fever,</i>

11:52.812 --> 11:55.146
and then share your hopes
for the future.

11:55.231 --> 11:56.731
No, wait.
The dance thing is fixed?

11:56.782 --> 11:58.650
So what is this,
some teacher's

11:58.734 --> 12:00.151
manipulative game
to get us tell you

12:00.236 --> 12:02.037
what we want to be
when we grow up?

12:02.104 --> 12:03.805
Hey, if you want to look
at it that way, fine.

12:03.873 --> 12:05.907
But this is
your game,
your life.

12:05.958 --> 12:08.877
And guess what,
time's running out.

<i>Just because I don't want
to rush off to New York</i>

12:16.669 --> 12:19.054
<i>like Berry and star

12:19.121 --> 12:21.890
<i>doesn't mean I don't know
what I want to do with my life.</i>

12:21.957 --> 12:23.925
<i>And I'm sorry, having a dream
isn't the problem.</i>

12:23.976 --> 12:26.895

don't know how to get there.</i>

12:26.962 --> 12:29.564

14:44.033 --> 14:45.867
All right, I have
an announcement to make.

14:45.934 --> 14:48.036
Contrary to current opinion,

14:48.103 --> 14:49.821
I do have a dream.

14:49.905 --> 14:51.673
See, my dream is

14:51.741 --> 14:53.291
Mariah.

14:53.375 --> 14:55.210
It's Whitney--

14:55.277 --> 14:56.461
rest in peace.

14:56.545 --> 14:57.378
It's Aretha.

14:57.446 --> 14:58.379
Those are people.

14:58.447 --> 14:59.631
They aren't dreams.

14:59.715 --> 15:01.115
My dream is to be like them.

15:01.167 --> 15:04.085
To sing big, fat, juicy,

15:04.136 --> 15:06.805
number-one hits
that inspire people.

15:06.889 --> 15:08.923
But...

15:08.974 --> 15:12.177
how's that supposed to happen,
even if I move to L.A.?

15:12.261 --> 15:14.763
I don't know what to do...
or where to go.

15:14.814 --> 15:16.464
It's scary
to even think

15:16.515 --> 15:18.566
about moving all the way
across the country.

15:18.634 --> 15:19.984
Well, I mean,

15:20.069 --> 15:21.636
I'm moving to New York,
Mercedes.

15:21.687 --> 15:22.987
You'll have somewhere
to stay.

15:23.072 --> 15:24.022
You'll...

15:24.106 --> 15:25.774
You'll have something to do.

15:25.825 --> 15:27.492
You have two parents
that support you.

15:27.576 --> 15:30.078
And my dad is a dentist.

15:30.145 --> 15:32.197
He thinks my dream
is unreasonable

15:32.281 --> 15:33.448
and insane.
You know what,

15:33.499 --> 15:34.449
he's right.

15:34.500 --> 15:36.167
I don't know the first thing

15:36.252 --> 15:39.153
about getting a recording
contract or a manager.

15:39.205 --> 15:41.389
The cream always rises
to the top, Mercedes.

15:41.457 --> 15:43.324
Yeah, I'm cream in here,
Mr. Shue.

15:43.392 --> 15:49.464
But what if, out there,
I'm just... skim milk?

You should talk to him.
Help him.

16:10.402 --> 16:11.619
He called me spoiled and
self-centered, okay.

16:11.687 --> 16:13.404
He can come to me
and talk to me first.

16:13.489 --> 16:15.874
That's a great way
to start a marriage.

16:21.547 --> 16:23.832
So what's up, dude?
We doing this L.A.
thing or what?

16:23.883 --> 16:25.300
'Cause I had to go
apartment-shopping.

16:25.367 --> 16:27.302
And if I get a one-bedroom,
you're screwed.

16:27.369 --> 16:29.420
Two dudes in one bed
is like confirmed gay.

16:29.505 --> 16:30.805
I can't.

16:30.873 --> 16:32.507
Look, that's your dream,
not mine. Uh...

16:32.558 --> 16:33.675
Dude, I can't go
without you.

16:33.726 --> 16:34.926
You're my best friend.

16:35.010 --> 16:36.344
You can do anything
without me, man, okay?

16:36.395 --> 16:37.846
You never needed me before.

16:37.897 --> 16:39.848
Yeah, but if you're
there with me,

16:39.899 --> 16:42.150
then that big city
won't seem so... scary.

16:42.217 --> 16:43.718
Scary?

16:43.769 --> 16:45.653
Scary? Nothing
scares you, man.

16:45.721 --> 16:48.690
Your five-mile ride on top
of Mrs. Witt's Chrysler

16:48.741 --> 16:51.609
is still a car-surfing
record, okay.

16:51.694 --> 16:55.563
Seriously, just... you'll have
that place wired in no time.

16:55.614 --> 16:59.334
So if you're not going with me,
what are you going to do?

16:59.401 --> 17:01.202
(sighs)
I still really don't know.

17:05.124 --> 17:07.074
Well, do me
one favor, would you?

17:07.126 --> 17:08.259
When you do find your dream,

17:08.344 --> 17:10.377
make it as big as you are.

17:10.429 --> 17:12.797
I don't know much,
but I know this.

17:12.882 --> 17:15.349
You owe it to yourself.

17:15.416 --> 17:17.268
And now you owe it to me.

17:22.423 --> 17:22.423
+

17:23.778 --> 17:25.311
Porcelain, Wheezy, have a seat.

17:27.799 --> 17:28.865
Traitors.

17:28.933 --> 17:30.367
What are you talking about?

17:30.434 --> 17:32.602
As you may as well know,
I have a large portion

17:32.653 --> 17:34.287
of this school bugged
and wiretapped.

17:34.355 --> 17:38.375
I am already pushing the
very limits of physics

17:38.442 --> 17:40.276
by joining forces
with Will Schuester.

17:40.328 --> 17:42.712
And you repay my help

17:42.780 --> 17:44.714
by giving tips to the enemy?

17:44.782 --> 17:46.800
Oh, no, that's not
what happened at all.

17:46.884 --> 17:50.136
Wade was asking us for advice,
because he wants to wear a dress

17:50.204 --> 17:51.638
and perform
at Regionals

17:51.722 --> 17:53.056
as his alter ego Unique,

17:53.123 --> 17:54.724
an-and we didn't think
it was a very good idea.

17:54.792 --> 17:55.959
It's not a good idea.

17:56.010 --> 17:57.644
It's a great idea.

17:57.728 --> 17:59.596
But Coach Sylvester,
this is Ohio.

17:59.647 --> 18:02.315
I don't think many people
are gonna be down with that.

18:02.400 --> 18:03.416
Exactly.

18:03.484 --> 18:05.268
He'll tank them
at Regionals.

18:05.319 --> 18:09.155
And then New Directions will
coast to a win at Nationals.

18:09.240 --> 18:12.141
I happen to have a pair
of 13 wides right here.

18:12.193 --> 18:14.244
Where did you get those?

18:14.311 --> 18:16.446
They were autographed
by my good friend Janet Reno.

18:16.497 --> 18:18.582
And she wore them on the day
they caught the Unabomber.

18:18.649 --> 18:20.584
Deliver these
unto Unique.

18:20.651 --> 18:22.302
Get him to cram his hamhocks

18:22.370 --> 18:24.170
into these platoons
at Regionals,

18:24.238 --> 18:27.707
and we'll be well on our way
to a National Championship.

Incredible.

20:00.801 --> 20:02.969
And I could see exactly
where you were going with it.

20:03.054 --> 20:05.522
This was more than just a
beautiful love song to Brittany.

20:05.589 --> 20:07.641
It's also a powerful way
to convey your dream

20:07.725 --> 20:09.843
that marriage equality
will someday be a reality

20:09.910 --> 20:11.561
for everyone,
and you're off

20:11.612 --> 20:13.446
to law school to make it happen!
Amazing.

20:13.531 --> 20:14.948
Of course
I want marriage equality.

20:15.032 --> 20:16.950
And yeah, Brittany will
always be my girlfriend.

20:17.034 --> 20:19.369
Score!
But my mistress is fame.

20:19.436 --> 20:23.106
And that song was all about how
I can't live withouts my fame.

20:23.157 --> 20:24.874
Then I'll have to say
I'm disappointed in you.

20:24.942 --> 20:26.910
Fame is not something
to aspire to.

20:26.961 --> 20:28.945
How about you save the lecture
for the theatre nerds

20:28.996 --> 20:30.413
that are gonna starve
in New York

20:30.464 --> 20:32.165
while desperately trying
to tap-dance their way

20:32.249 --> 20:33.583
<i>into the chorus of Godspell?</i>

20:33.634 --> 20:34.751
No offence, Gayberry.

20:34.819 --> 20:36.970
And everyone can
stop their hating,

20:37.054 --> 20:38.221
because you all want
to be famous, too.

20:38.288 --> 20:39.305
The only difference is

20:39.390 --> 20:41.307
that I'm a thousand percent sure

20:41.392 --> 20:43.326
that I'm actually
going to be famous,

20:43.394 --> 20:44.728
just like I'm a thousand

20:44.795 --> 20:46.513
percent sure that
our Man/Child piano player

20:46.597 --> 20:49.232
keeps a petite Eurasian locked
in a trunk underneath his bed.

20:49.299 --> 20:50.183
Sorry, James.

20:50.267 --> 20:51.151
Write this down--

20:51.235 --> 20:52.652
'cause there will
be a quiz--

20:52.737 --> 20:53.970
<i>I'm gonna be famous.</i>

20:54.021 --> 20:55.805
If it's the last thing I do.

20:59.744 --> 21:01.611
(footsteps approaching)

21:02.863 --> 21:03.997
I got your tweet.

21:04.081 --> 21:05.665
"Anyone who's engaged to me

21:05.750 --> 21:07.200
should come to the auditorium."

21:07.284 --> 21:09.335
You could've just texted.

21:09.420 --> 21:12.088
Yeah, but I wasn't sure
if we were speaking.

21:12.156 --> 21:14.207
I miss you.

21:14.291 --> 21:15.324
I miss you, too.

21:17.661 --> 21:20.130
Now I feel like I'm finally
reentering my body.

21:20.181 --> 21:22.599
I really don't like
not talking to you.

21:22.666 --> 21:24.768
I mean, nothing feels real
unless you're there
to tell it to.

21:24.835 --> 21:26.436
I never realized how much
time we spent talking.

21:26.503 --> 21:29.222
I've been thinking, and if you
don't want to go to New York,

21:29.306 --> 21:30.356
then we don't have to.

21:30.441 --> 21:32.942
Wh... Wh... That's crazy.

21:33.010 --> 21:34.894
I don't want to stand
in the way of your dreams.

21:34.979 --> 21:37.847
Look, the only reason why
we've been focusing on my dreams

21:37.898 --> 21:40.850
is because we haven't taken
the time to look into yours.

21:40.901 --> 21:42.685
What if your dreams
are bigger than mine?

21:42.737 --> 21:44.353
I don't think that's
going to be a problem.

21:44.405 --> 21:46.355
I mean, I did one of
those quizzes online

21:46.407 --> 21:48.691
that was supposed to tell you
what job you'd be good at,

21:48.743 --> 21:50.577
and my results were
"competitive eating champion."

21:50.661 --> 21:52.162
Okay, sit down.

21:54.131 --> 21:57.300
My whole life, I felt like
I was in the wrong place.

21:57.367 --> 22:00.970
Like I was just some alien,
an-and... no one understood me.

22:01.038 --> 22:02.722
But all I had to do was just

22:02.807 --> 22:04.140
go to New York.

22:04.208 --> 22:05.541
Go home to Broadway,

22:05.593 --> 22:08.011
and then everything
would be fine.

22:08.062 --> 22:09.429
But I was wrong.

22:09.513 --> 22:14.150
My home isn't some place,
it's... someone.

22:14.218 --> 22:15.485
It's you.

22:15.552 --> 22:18.822
Of course, I want us
to go to New York,

22:18.889 --> 22:21.441
and... maybe we will.

22:21.525 --> 22:24.027
But not until we give
your dreams an equal shot.

22:26.897 --> 22:29.165
You love me that much?

22:29.233 --> 22:31.234
Are you just figuring
that out now?

22:31.285 --> 22:33.670
So, can I please
sing to you about it?

22:33.737 --> 22:35.588
I mean, it's from the movie,
and it's really good.

22:35.673 --> 22:37.073
Do I have a choice?

22:37.124 --> 22:39.259
Well, you know,
I kind of planned
No choice.

22:39.343 --> 22:40.877
the whole singing thing
first, just in case

22:40.928 --> 22:42.462
you took a little convincing.

22:42.546 --> 22:45.215
I mean, I'd hate for
it to go to waste.

that you actually have a shot

so you hang onto those.

24:53.978 --> 24:55.895
Mm-hmm!
It's a lot to go through.

24:55.980 --> 24:57.764
Yeah. I mean,
what do you think, Finn?

24:57.848 --> 25:00.233
Think your dream is
hidden in there somewhere?

25:00.317 --> 25:01.734
I don't know.
This is a lot of choices.

25:01.819 --> 25:02.902
Well, there's no rush.

25:02.987 --> 25:04.570
I mean, there's a little,
you know, rush,

25:04.655 --> 25:06.055
because the applications
are due soon,

25:06.106 --> 25:07.690
and, well, I mean,
there's the whole

25:07.741 --> 25:08.908
we need to figure out

25:08.993 --> 25:10.276
where we're gonna begin
our lives thing, but

25:10.361 --> 25:12.428
there's no rush.

25:13.497 --> 25:14.447
Okay.

25:14.531 --> 25:15.698
Well, I guess I just need to

25:15.749 --> 25:17.500
take some time
with these by myself,

25:17.567 --> 25:19.235
and see if I can, you know,

25:19.286 --> 25:22.005
shake a dream
out of here somehow.
EMMA:
It's in there.

25:22.072 --> 25:23.906
Okay.

25:23.958 --> 25:25.574
Hey, uh...

25:25.626 --> 25:26.676
Thanks.

25:26.743 --> 25:27.877
All of you.

25:30.214 --> 25:31.080
Hey, Finn...

25:32.749 --> 25:34.183
We believe in you.

25:34.251 --> 25:36.085
Thanks.

25:50.701 --> 25:52.568
(bell ringing)

26:00.878 --> 26:02.628
Santana, watching
"Two Girls One Cat"

26:02.713 --> 26:04.280
was like staring into
the face of God.

26:04.331 --> 26:05.948
Thank you.
New favorite movie.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.950
Why is everyone staring
at me like I'm Finn

26:08.002 --> 26:09.618
and I just won
a butter-eating competition?

26:09.670 --> 26:12.472
It's because you're famous.

26:12.556 --> 26:14.790
Everybody's loving the sex tape
of us I posted on the Internet.

26:14.842 --> 26:17.510
What?! Brittany, that
sex tape was private.

26:17.594 --> 26:19.095
We made that for us.

26:19.146 --> 26:21.180
No, I know, but I spliced it
together with a video of

26:21.265 --> 26:22.648
Lord Tubbington performing
everyday household chores.

26:22.733 --> 26:24.434
(meows)

26:24.485 --> 26:25.601
Why would you do that?

26:25.652 --> 26:27.236
'Cause you said you
wanted to be famous.

26:27.304 --> 26:29.305
So I looked up all
the famous people that I knew,

26:29.356 --> 26:30.806
and they all have sex tapes.

26:30.858 --> 26:32.358
So I put ours out there.

26:32.443 --> 26:34.160
I'm really excited
about it!

26:36.413 --> 26:38.614
(meows)

26:41.768 --> 26:41.768
+

26:42.899 --> 26:44.667
(bell ringing)
Come with me.

26:52.009 --> 26:53.576
What, are you going through
the garbage now?

26:53.627 --> 26:56.379
Oh, come on. I know you were
just humoring us in there.

26:56.430 --> 26:58.598
I could see it in your face.
So I followed you out.

26:58.682 --> 27:01.134
What was I supposed to say, man?

27:01.218 --> 27:02.685
S-Sorry, I'd rather puke

27:02.752 --> 27:04.554
than spend a minute in
any of those places?

27:04.605 --> 27:07.056
Right in front of
Rachel, with...

27:07.107 --> 27:09.225
a big smile on her face,
all proud of herself?

27:09.276 --> 27:10.259
She just wants
what's best for you.

27:10.310 --> 27:11.477
Yeah, she does.

27:11.562 --> 27:13.196
Until she realizes her
fiancé is a total loser.

27:13.263 --> 27:14.480
Is that what you're scared of?

27:14.565 --> 27:16.149
It's the truth.

27:16.233 --> 27:18.067
Doesn't anybody understand that

27:18.118 --> 27:20.570
maybe the reason I don't know
what to do with my life

27:20.621 --> 27:22.905
is because I'm not
qualified to do anything.

27:22.956 --> 27:24.040
You just don't know
what you want yet.

27:24.107 --> 27:25.658
What I want is for time to stop.

27:25.742 --> 27:27.210
Okay?

27:27.277 --> 27:29.412
I want it to feel like
I'm on the football field

27:29.463 --> 27:31.297
and the crowd's going nuts!

27:31.381 --> 27:33.549
Or I-I want it to feel
like I'm on the stage

27:33.617 --> 27:35.168
during a performance, and
everybody's on their feet.

27:35.252 --> 27:36.502
So let's find
something out there

27:36.587 --> 27:38.754
that gives you that feeling.
Of being young?

27:40.290 --> 27:41.841
Where is it?

27:41.925 --> 27:43.125
Show me.

27:52.853 --> 27:54.520
I want you to watch this for me.

27:54.605 --> 27:56.355
Look, Mr. Shue,
I don't really feel like doing

27:56.440 --> 27:58.074
my Glee homework right now,
I just...

27:58.141 --> 28:00.776
I think you know what
you want for your life.

28:00.827 --> 28:03.496
I think you're just scared
to say it out loud.

28:03.580 --> 28:05.481
I want you to see
what it looks like

28:05.532 --> 28:06.699
when someone follows
their dream,

28:06.783 --> 28:08.417
even though everyone else

28:08.485 --> 28:09.869
tells them it's impossible.

28:09.953 --> 28:12.588
You can do anything
you want to, Finn.

28:14.291 --> 28:16.008
It's not the broken dreams
that break us.

28:17.678 --> 28:19.378
It's the ones we
didn't dare to dream.

the way I use my walk... ♪

28:27.221 --> 28:29.138

28:32.442 --> 28:35.645
You make a cat emptying
the dishwasher look sexy.

28:35.696 --> 28:37.196
I love you, Santana Lopez.

28:37.281 --> 28:39.065
Awesome, right?

28:39.149 --> 28:41.317
Don't thank me
for your new fame.

28:41.368 --> 28:43.686
You know, it didn't really
cross my mind to thank you.

28:43.737 --> 28:46.572
Yeah, well, you say the dream,
and I help build your dream.

28:46.657 --> 28:48.241
And that's what
a partnership is about, right?

28:48.325 --> 28:50.042
Listen, Britt,
I totally understand

28:50.127 --> 28:51.527
how you could think
that you were helping me,

28:51.578 --> 28:53.412
but you gotta
take the video down.

28:53.497 --> 28:55.164
No way! Now that we just
got your boob in the door,

28:55.215 --> 28:56.582
we can't rest.

28:56.667 --> 28:58.000
I came up with an idea

28:58.051 --> 28:59.835
that will make you,
like, Snooki famous,

28:59.886 --> 29:01.804
but without all
the blackout drinking.

29:01.871 --> 29:03.339
We need to book you
on a reality TV gig ASAP.

29:03.390 --> 29:05.725
So I've narrowed it down
to a few possibilities.

29:05.809 --> 29:08.177
Number one: I see how
you keep your car,

29:08.228 --> 29:09.762
<i>so you could totally
be on Hoarders.</i>

29:09.846 --> 29:11.681
You just need to start storing
your poops in the trunk,

29:11.732 --> 29:13.149
and I'm sure they'll book you.

29:13.216 --> 29:14.517
No. Brittany,
I can't do that.

29:14.568 --> 29:16.068
Well, you have to,
if you want to be on the show.

29:16.153 --> 29:19.021
Or... this is
my favorite one.

29:19.072 --> 29:21.223
You can eat that.
It's a bull testicle.

29:21.275 --> 29:23.409
I drove all the way to
Spencerville to get it.

29:23.493 --> 29:24.577
You know, it came with a pair,

29:24.661 --> 29:25.894
but I got hungry on
the way home, so...

29:25.946 --> 29:26.895
It tastes just like
a chicken testicle.

29:26.947 --> 29:28.230
I don't get it.

29:28.282 --> 29:29.732
<i>It's for Fear Factor.</i>

29:29.783 --> 29:31.867
If you want to be famous,
you have to eat crazy stuff.

29:33.620 --> 29:35.838
Just let me know how far
you're willing to go for fame.

29:35.905 --> 29:37.673
It's up to you.

29:39.960 --> 29:42.044
(bell ringing)

29:42.095 --> 29:44.430
I feel horrible.

29:44.514 --> 29:46.248
We should never have
given Wade those high heels.

29:46.300 --> 29:47.916
Look, there's still
time to stop it.

29:47.968 --> 29:50.136
I mean, he wouldn't
actually go out like that.

29:50.220 --> 29:51.304
Would he?

29:51.388 --> 29:52.855
Well, Finn dressed up
like Lady Gaga,

29:52.922 --> 29:55.391
and I never thought
that would happen.

29:55.442 --> 29:57.693
KURT:
Oh, thank God.

29:57.761 --> 29:59.812
Hey, Wade!
We just came by to

29:59.896 --> 30:01.480
tell you to break a leg.

30:01.565 --> 30:02.898
And to make sure you're
still dressed as a guy.

30:02.949 --> 30:04.483
Not for long.

30:04.568 --> 30:07.036
Look, Wade, I know we
sent you those shoes

30:07.103 --> 30:08.537
as a good-luck gesture, but

30:08.605 --> 30:11.240
w-we talked it over,
and you can't do this.

30:11.291 --> 30:14.994
I admit that I've worn some
flamboyant designer outfits,

30:15.078 --> 30:16.796
but I've never dressed up
like a woman.

30:16.880 --> 30:19.215
That's because you
identify yourself as a man.

30:20.884 --> 30:22.785
I thought you, of all people,
would understand.

30:24.120 --> 30:25.954
I'm wearing them.

30:27.624 --> 30:31.927
JESSE:
Wow. Look who Schuester
sent to spy on me.

30:31.978 --> 30:33.346
The laziest person alive

30:33.430 --> 30:34.814
and the pasty-faced ghost boy.

30:34.898 --> 30:36.298
Come on.

30:36.350 --> 30:38.234
We're not spies.
We're friends of Wade's.

30:38.301 --> 30:39.652
Really?

30:39.736 --> 30:41.854
All the more reason to
fire him after the show.

being-able-to-dance thing.

that Tony took on the world...

I want to do that, too.

I want to move to New York.

cool dude you made me watch?

36:15.524 --> 36:16.891

36:16.976 --> 36:18.560
Yeah.
I applied to his school.

36:18.644 --> 36:21.146
I want to go
to Inside the Actors' Studio.

36:21.197 --> 36:24.532
It's... It's just
"The Actors' Studio,"

36:24.617 --> 36:26.151
but that's great.

36:26.218 --> 36:27.953
It's a perfect,
perfect fit for you.

36:28.020 --> 36:30.956
You just, you know, you can't...
do this for me, all right?

36:31.023 --> 36:32.690
It has to be for you.

36:32.742 --> 36:35.460
It's too much pressure
for me to handle.

36:35.527 --> 36:38.029
It is for you, but it's
also what I want.

36:39.031 --> 36:40.031
It's my dream.

36:40.099 --> 36:42.050

36:43.636 --> 36:45.536
I guess I was always afraid
to admit it

36:45.588 --> 36:47.339

36:47.390 --> 36:49.507

Unique pulled that off.

37:21.090 --> 37:22.173

to be said

37:22.241 --> 37:23.375
about the power
of a dream.

37:23.426 --> 37:24.959
Mm-hmm.

37:25.044 --> 37:26.744
He took a risk
and it paid off.

37:32.635 --> 37:34.019
I know we haven't
talked much,

37:34.086 --> 37:36.888
but I have something
that I need to show you.

37:36.939 --> 37:38.223
No more songs, Sam.

37:38.274 --> 37:39.691
One more.

37:39.758 --> 37:41.693
Don't worry. This time I'm not
the one singing.

37:41.760 --> 37:45.146
♪ Burn, baby, burn... ♪

37:45.231 --> 37:46.931
That's me.

37:46.982 --> 37:48.366
Yeah.

37:48.434 --> 37:50.869
Wait-- did you post this
to YouTube without asking?

37:50.936 --> 37:52.404
Can you hear yourself?

37:52.455 --> 37:56.291
You're amazing,
and you look stunning.

37:59.578 --> 38:01.379
485 comments?

38:01.447 --> 38:02.664
Mm, I can't look.

38:02.748 --> 38:05.467
No. Look.

38:05.551 --> 38:07.252
484 of them are positive.

38:07.303 --> 38:09.620
One of them
was disappointed

38:09.672 --> 38:13.124
because they thought
"Mercedes Inferno"
was a car-fail video.

38:13.175 --> 38:17.295
I can't believe
you did this for me.

38:17.346 --> 38:18.646
Why?

38:18.731 --> 38:23.518
Because I believe in you and
what you could become.

38:23.602 --> 38:26.871
Now complete strangers
believe in you, too.

38:26.939 --> 38:30.475
You just need to find a way out
to L.A. and do your thing.

38:30.526 --> 38:31.809
It's time for this dream

38:31.861 --> 38:33.495
to stop being a dream
and become a reality.

38:33.579 --> 38:35.413
Listen to them.

38:35.481 --> 38:37.582
They all want to buy
your album, and so do I.

38:37.649 --> 38:39.851
You ain't no skim milk, baby.

38:41.704 --> 38:43.988
You're the cream
rising to the top.

38:50.229 --> 38:50.229
+

38:51.115 --> 38:52.332
(bell ringing)

38:52.400 --> 38:54.201
Boobs Magoo,
words simply cannot describe

38:54.252 --> 38:55.619
how disappointed
I am in you.

38:55.703 --> 38:57.904
And look at
poor Brittany.

38:57.956 --> 38:59.623
Her chagrin is limited
only by the fact

38:59.707 --> 39:01.008
that she has a brain

39:01.075 --> 39:02.709
the size of a toddler's fist.

39:02.760 --> 39:04.094
I can show you
the MRI.

39:04.179 --> 39:06.847
And it's not just the sex tape.

39:06.914 --> 39:09.516
My goodness, sex tapes
are a dime a dozen these days.

39:09.584 --> 39:12.269
I myself made a sex tape
with Oliver North.

39:13.771 --> 39:15.556
Wasn't very popular,
probably because

39:15.623 --> 39:16.723
we released it
on Betamax.

39:16.791 --> 39:18.809
I think Cheney still has a copy.

39:18.877 --> 39:21.361
What's so disappointing
is not that you want
to be famous,

39:21.429 --> 39:23.247
it's that you don't care
how you get there.

39:23.314 --> 39:24.731
I see that now.

39:24.782 --> 39:27.067
I'm embarrassed I've
been so shortsighted.

39:27.118 --> 39:29.736
I want to make
something of my life.

39:29.787 --> 39:32.706
I want to do something
of substance with it.

39:32.773 --> 39:34.441
And yes, I do want
to go to college.

39:34.492 --> 39:36.610
One step ahead of you,
Lady Ta-Ta.

39:36.661 --> 39:38.128
What is this?

39:38.213 --> 39:39.296
That is an acceptance letter.

39:39.380 --> 39:41.164
You got a full ride

39:41.249 --> 39:43.283
from the University
of Louisville.
It's in Louisville.

39:43.334 --> 39:45.669
It's the nation's top
cheerleading program

39:45.753 --> 39:46.970
and you got a full
scholarship.

39:47.055 --> 39:49.139
Now, I know you don't want
to be a cheerleader

39:49.224 --> 39:50.724
for the rest of your life.

39:50.791 --> 39:52.959
But this will get you
a foot in the door.

39:53.011 --> 39:54.678
Maybe you can get
a business degree;

39:54.746 --> 39:57.848
open up a taco truck.

39:57.932 --> 39:59.650
I'm still somewhat confused
about your ethnicity.

39:59.734 --> 40:02.769
I don't know what to say.

40:02.820 --> 40:04.004
Thank you.

40:04.072 --> 40:04.988
Well, don't thank me.

40:05.073 --> 40:06.189
Brittany thought of it.

40:06.274 --> 40:08.275
She gets an idea once
every couple of years,

40:08.326 --> 40:10.661
and lucky for us
this was a good one.

40:10.745 --> 40:11.945
Thank you.

40:13.814 --> 40:16.783
I don't know if this is
100% the answer for me,

40:16.834 --> 40:18.485
but just to know that
I have somebody

40:18.553 --> 40:22.706
who believes in me
as much as you do.

40:22.790 --> 40:24.491
I love you so much.

40:25.927 --> 40:27.377
I love you, too.

40:29.213 --> 40:31.014
(bell ringing)

40:31.099 --> 40:32.799
Come on, who won, Mr. Shue?
Who gets the suit?

40:32.850 --> 40:34.518
Well, I left that
up to Sue.

40:34.602 --> 40:36.836
And if there's one thing I enjoy

40:36.888 --> 40:38.305
more than punishing
you lazy idiots...

40:38.356 --> 40:39.673
it's rewarding you
for being

40:39.724 --> 40:41.058
slightly less lazy
and idiotic.

40:41.142 --> 40:43.644
Will the winners please enter?

40:43.695 --> 40:46.780
(all cheering, whooping)

40:46.847 --> 40:48.198
Even in polyester,

40:48.283 --> 40:50.067
I feel like a million
bucks in this.

40:50.151 --> 40:51.068
So what now?

40:51.152 --> 40:52.819
What do you want to do?

40:52.870 --> 40:54.521
You know what I want to do?
What?

40:54.572 --> 40:56.406
I said, do you
know what I want to do?!

40:56.491 --> 40:57.524
ALL:
What?

40:57.575 --> 40:59.159
Strut.
