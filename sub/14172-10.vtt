WEBVTT

00:00.794 --> 00:02.276
Previously on Tyrant...

00:02.306 --> 00:04.151
There will be no peace in Abbudin

00:04.181 --> 00:06.397
with my brother in power;
he has to be removed.

00:06.476 --> 00:08.925
So you want to have a coup,
oust your own brother?

00:09.022 --> 00:11.913
We need to remove Tariq
before we remove Jamal.

00:12.024 --> 00:15.031
You have three days to turn
Jamal against Tariq.

00:15.363 --> 00:17.109
You'll have to come up
with a credible reason

00:17.139 --> 00:18.608
to send Molly and the kids
back to the States

00:18.638 --> 00:19.775
before this goes down.

00:19.805 --> 00:20.877
And, uh, until then,

00:20.907 --> 00:22.148
best to keep her in the dark.

00:22.351 --> 00:24.676
Why would you stay here
if Jamal won't even be president?

00:24.706 --> 00:25.826
There's nothing you can do.

00:25.856 --> 00:27.320
Molly, I'm taking his place.

00:27.350 --> 00:30.191
They hang people
in this part of the world for this shit, Barry.

00:30.221 --> 00:34.466
You will assume my uncle's position
as head of Abbudin's military.

00:35.830 --> 00:37.147
General Tariq,

00:37.177 --> 00:39.165
you are hereby under arrest for treason.

00:41.697 --> 00:43.085
Let whatever happens here

00:43.417 --> 00:44.782
happen without you.

00:45.250 --> 00:47.395
Come on. Just come home with us.

00:54.465 --> 00:56.618
Don't expect us to come back.

00:57.244 --> 00:58.464
See, Bassam?

00:58.494 --> 01:00.145
I don't murder family.

01:00.538 --> 01:02.688
No matter how treacherous.

01:02.871 --> 01:04.784
How... traitorous.

01:04.902 --> 01:07.020
You were a killer
when you were nine years old,

01:07.050 --> 01:08.697
and you still are.

01:09.228 --> 01:11.528
I know your soul, Bassam.

01:11.558 --> 01:14.027
Killer! I know who you are!

01:23.120 --> 01:25.088
Bassam, which one you prefer?

01:25.118 --> 01:26.707
Uh, whichever's fine.

01:26.895 --> 01:28.721
No, you have to choose.

01:29.136 --> 01:30.852
What's the difference?

01:31.064 --> 01:34.293
One is black, one is red.

01:36.387 --> 01:38.067
I'll take the black one.

01:38.235 --> 01:41.320
I prefer the red. That's fine.

01:41.405 --> 01:42.867
Uh...

01:43.176 --> 01:46.257
The lures, uh,
I have picked for both of us.

01:46.368 --> 01:48.070
I hope you don't mind.

01:53.286 --> 01:57.286
This one, uh... was father's favorite.

01:57.793 --> 02:00.006
The fatma jig. I remember.

02:00.392 --> 02:03.142
Once caught a 20-pound yellowtail with that.

02:03.460 --> 02:07.096
It was me who caught
the yellowtail, as I remember.

02:10.580 --> 02:12.235
Yeah, you're right.

02:16.027 --> 02:17.392
So...

02:18.485 --> 02:22.525
Tariq still won't name names, huh?

02:24.458 --> 02:26.833
Well, maybe there are
no names to name.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.335
There are always names.

02:29.503 --> 02:31.721
And Ziad will get them for me.

02:39.179 --> 02:40.640
The president...

02:40.670 --> 02:42.727
he was very insistent on knowing every name.

02:42.866 --> 02:44.082
There are no names.

02:44.218 --> 02:45.610
There is no coup.

02:46.011 --> 02:48.008
Other than the one you are planning.

02:48.345 --> 02:49.964
We shall see about that.

02:50.946 --> 02:52.293
Yes, I know.

02:52.843 --> 02:55.272
Most days, I stood where you are standing,

02:55.378 --> 02:57.085
so I know how this goes.

02:58.090 --> 02:59.875
I'll make up names, Ziad,

03:00.207 --> 03:02.213
if you'll tell me why you're betraying me.

03:03.157 --> 03:05.108
Did I abuse you too much?

03:05.302 --> 03:06.705
Humiliate you?

03:07.447 --> 03:09.287
You made it so easy.

03:09.353 --> 03:11.728
I still can't fathom
how I could've missed it.

03:11.797 --> 03:13.006
Your hatred.

03:13.313 --> 03:14.826
Your ambition.

03:15.970 --> 03:18.197
Now, that's insulting.

03:27.533 --> 03:30.055
Why don't you just
kill me and end this charade?

03:30.093 --> 03:32.266
Think of this as my
first act of penance

03:32.456 --> 03:36.636
for all the unspeakable acts of cruelty
I committed on your behalf.

03:38.647 --> 03:41.002
Under orders from the President,

03:41.032 --> 03:43.734
General Ziad has taken control
of all the military bases

03:43.764 --> 03:46.207
and secured the perimeter of the capital.

03:46.655 --> 03:49.704
Your brother has placed
the noose around his own neck.

03:50.528 --> 03:52.282
Thank you, General Shadid.

03:53.474 --> 03:54.354
This is Ayoob Aziz,

03:54.384 --> 03:55.936
the new head of Palace security.

03:55.966 --> 03:59.084
- We're counting on you, Mr. Aziz.
- Everything is in place...

03:59.209 --> 04:00.818
Mr. President.

04:01.362 --> 04:03.275
Call me Bassam for now.

04:04.045 --> 04:05.359
So...

04:05.543 --> 04:07.600
Once Molly and your kids are in the air,

04:07.630 --> 04:10.550
Mr. Aziz will relieve
the Palace guard of their duties

04:10.580 --> 04:14.347
and place Leila, Ahmed, Nusrat
and your mother under house arrest.

04:14.415 --> 04:16.831
- No. Not my mother.
- For her own safety.

04:16.937 --> 04:19.459
Just until the situation is stable.

04:19.819 --> 04:22.332
My daughter, too, please.

04:22.535 --> 04:24.841
I want her protected.

04:26.721 --> 04:29.210
Tomorrow,
when Jamal and I return from fishing,

04:29.240 --> 04:31.226
Ziad will place him under arrest,

04:31.304 --> 04:33.919
and then you lift the television blackout.

04:34.407 --> 04:36.141
What will you tell the people?

04:36.214 --> 04:39.111
What you choose
to say will be crucial, Bassam.

04:39.646 --> 04:42.586
I'm hoping to convince Jamal
to offer his resignation,

04:42.616 --> 04:45.017
make a statement to the people
that he loves his country,

04:45.047 --> 04:46.626
that's why he's choosing to step down.

04:46.723 --> 04:48.974
You really think
his ego will allow that?

04:49.084 --> 04:50.883
I think his ego will demand it.

04:51.186 --> 04:53.561
Otherwise, it's being overthrown
by his brother.

04:53.787 --> 04:54.740
Either way,

04:54.770 --> 04:58.582
someone will need to assure
the world of a smooth transition

04:58.612 --> 05:00.789
to the promised democratic elections.

05:00.844 --> 05:02.560
I, uh...

05:03.148 --> 05:05.664
I wouldn't count on that being Jamal.

05:09.595 --> 05:11.758
Who else is behind you on this?

05:12.164 --> 05:14.429
It's better you don't know.
Not yet.

05:14.459 --> 05:17.274
But I need you to help make this work.

05:17.432 --> 05:18.525
Me?

05:19.147 --> 05:20.347
How?

05:20.752 --> 05:22.855
Fauzi,
they're gonna call me a usurper.

05:22.885 --> 05:23.784
An American.

05:23.814 --> 05:24.439
I...

05:24.469 --> 05:26.651
I need you to help me
make my case to the people.

05:26.750 --> 05:29.262
I need you to help me
find the right words.

05:31.271 --> 05:34.129
You want me to be
your propagandist.

05:34.877 --> 05:36.713
No, I'm asking you to write a speech.

05:37.028 --> 05:39.919
Bassam, I've been imprisoned
and tortured by the Al Fayeeds.

05:39.949 --> 05:41.624
Now you're asking me to work for one.

05:41.792 --> 05:43.949
Goddamn it, Fauzi,
you're the one that keeps telling me

05:43.979 --> 05:47.602
I have a responsibility to fix
this place because of who I am.

05:47.903 --> 05:48.849
Bassam...

05:48.943 --> 05:50.224
What about you?

05:50.526 --> 05:52.237
I'm giving you a chance
to do something here,

05:52.267 --> 05:54.310
not just write about it.

05:58.900 --> 05:59.743
Yeah?

05:59.870 --> 06:01.240
Barry.

06:02.497 --> 06:03.905
We need to talk.

06:04.377 --> 06:06.569
Get here as soon as you can.

06:10.176 --> 06:12.041
Are you in or out?

06:14.843 --> 06:16.858
I need your answer by tomorrow.

06:20.493 --> 06:22.631
They want out of
the democracy business.

06:23.277 --> 06:25.467
- Who does?
- State department.

06:25.861 --> 06:27.580
Higher-ups.

06:27.980 --> 06:30.574
What do you mean,
"out of the democracy business"?

06:30.677 --> 06:31.915
Take a look at Iraq.

06:32.796 --> 06:35.799
This isn't gonna be Iraq.
I would be the president.

06:36.651 --> 06:38.586
Our, uh, analysis is

06:38.616 --> 06:44.153
that you lose and Ihab Rashid
wins, his party cracks down...

06:44.613 --> 06:46.737
Sectarian violence all over again.

06:46.767 --> 06:49.425
So that was all true two days ago.
What the hell has changed?

06:49.557 --> 06:51.514
Well, with the plane crash
and the arrest of Tariq,

06:51.544 --> 06:53.911
your brother's taken his entire
senior command out of the picture.

06:53.982 --> 06:56.065
We thought we needed a coup to do that.

06:56.095 --> 06:58.301
With them gone,
state department feels that

06:58.390 --> 06:59.896
you can handle your brother.

06:59.926 --> 07:02.125
No more need for a coup.

07:03.179 --> 07:05.900
And Jamal wins
an election that I would lose?

07:06.060 --> 07:07.284
Uh, no, we're inclined to think

07:07.360 --> 07:10.142
he would fix the election,
but we're okay with that.

07:10.177 --> 07:12.455
We could use a good,
strong, secular leader

07:12.485 --> 07:13.971
who makes all the appropriate noises

07:14.001 --> 07:16.355
about democracy
without any of the messiness.

07:16.421 --> 07:18.384
No. No way. This has gone too far.

07:18.487 --> 07:20.512
Actually, you've gone just far enough.

07:20.899 --> 07:22.288
It's perfect.

07:23.159 --> 07:24.349
Fine.

07:24.705 --> 07:27.019
- This is ours now. We'll do it without you.
- Really?

07:27.049 --> 07:28.781
Without our encrypted comms?

07:29.285 --> 07:32.648
Without our cash to pay the military
while you take control of the treasury?

07:32.678 --> 07:34.859
Without our assurances
to the foreign governments

07:34.889 --> 07:38.489
that the U.S. stands
behind you and your currency?

07:38.749 --> 07:42.242
And without our protecting
your family once they're stateside?

07:44.481 --> 07:47.233
You are so smug, aren't you?

07:47.973 --> 07:50.138
You lose track of that in the U.S....

07:50.332 --> 07:51.668
the smugness.

07:51.698 --> 07:54.615
Well, actually,
we're a lot less smug than we used to be.

07:54.846 --> 07:57.092
We got our asses kicked recently.

07:57.953 --> 07:58.727
No,

07:58.757 --> 08:00.031
smug

08:00.215 --> 08:05.271
is thinking you can turn Abbudin
into a democracy overnight.

08:06.372 --> 08:07.540
Here's the thing:

08:07.728 --> 08:10.576
either you really want the power
or you're an idealist,

08:10.606 --> 08:11.753
and either way,

08:11.783 --> 08:13.196
that's a problem.

08:20.472 --> 08:23.320
- I tried, believe me.
- Not hard enough.

08:23.350 --> 08:25.130
- My hands are tied.
- Bullshit.

08:26.015 --> 08:28.472
Let it go, Barry. It's over.

08:29.162 --> 08:30.454
Tucker, you know Jamal.

08:30.484 --> 08:32.610
You know what he'll do.

09:56.799 --> 10:02.339
Sync and corrected by MystEre
www.addic7ed.com

10:18.812 --> 10:20.297
So, listen,

10:20.327 --> 10:23.753
there's this city on the coast
about half an hour from here.

10:23.825 --> 10:24.754
Azlan.

10:24.804 --> 10:27.082
It's supposed to be perfectly picturesque,

10:27.158 --> 10:29.526
- with the most amazing shopping.
- Mmm.

10:29.634 --> 10:31.536
I really wanted to go before I leave.

10:31.649 --> 10:32.845
Yeah, sounds great.

10:32.936 --> 10:35.811
But why not just wait till we're back
and then you don't have to rush it?

10:35.906 --> 10:37.618
But I don't think I'm coming back.

10:38.121 --> 10:39.496
Why wouldn't you come back?

10:39.526 --> 10:40.243
Really?

10:40.273 --> 10:42.858
Your father clearly sees
his chance to get rid of me.

10:42.914 --> 10:45.405
Why else would he be paying
for me to go with you?

10:45.504 --> 10:47.118
I don't need a dose of home.

10:47.213 --> 10:48.945
I was just home.

10:49.058 --> 10:51.254
I was running away from home.

10:51.812 --> 10:52.786
I guess.

10:52.871 --> 10:53.516
Look,

10:53.592 --> 10:55.738
the whole thing doesn't make sense.

10:56.063 --> 10:57.245
You guys going back,

10:57.306 --> 11:00.328
spur of the moment without him,
after he suggested it?

11:00.465 --> 11:04.080
But people do what they do.
I'm just saying he's not flying me back,

11:04.146 --> 11:07.719
and I can't afford to fly myself.

11:08.350 --> 11:09.922
So what do you say?

11:10.271 --> 11:12.653
Azlan tomorrow?

11:21.277 --> 11:22.454
Fauzi.

11:22.651 --> 11:24.172
Can we talk?

11:24.343 --> 11:25.671
Listen, um...

11:26.164 --> 11:28.069
Something's come up. We may need to...

11:28.099 --> 11:29.575
Just meet me outside the mosque.

11:29.710 --> 11:31.201
I'm here.

11:36.131 --> 11:36.868
Mmm!

11:39.108 --> 11:41.737
This is better than
the Moroccan food in Morocco.

11:41.767 --> 11:43.294
I am telling you.

11:43.324 --> 11:44.708
It's delicious.

11:46.443 --> 11:48.416
Your husband doesn't agree.

11:48.618 --> 11:49.997
No, not at all.

11:50.195 --> 11:51.287
It's delicious.

11:51.386 --> 11:53.914
We can have the kitchen
prepare whatever you like.

11:54.022 --> 11:55.793
Don't be polite; we're family.

11:55.823 --> 11:58.454
Really, I am enjoying it.

11:58.704 --> 12:01.255
Hakim has been distracted.

12:01.359 --> 12:03.063
His cousin was on the plane.

12:03.138 --> 12:04.146
Mmm.

12:04.328 --> 12:05.925
Yes, uh, sure. I'm...

12:05.996 --> 12:07.145
I'm very sorry.

12:07.196 --> 12:09.051
Colonel Hassan was a good man.

12:09.188 --> 12:10.662
Yes, a terrible loss.

12:10.901 --> 12:13.453
Anything new with the investigation?

12:13.702 --> 12:15.666
A fire, caused by

12:15.774 --> 12:18.330
catastrophic electrical failure.

12:18.420 --> 12:20.180
That's the prevailing, um,

12:20.331 --> 12:22.545
theory for now.

12:23.155 --> 12:25.837
But enough with, uh, bad news.

12:25.867 --> 12:27.680
Let's celebrate the good news.

12:27.811 --> 12:29.516
That our children

12:29.610 --> 12:32.590
- worked out their problems.
- Yes.

12:34.413 --> 12:36.958
The key to success in life...

12:37.613 --> 12:40.268
A healthy marriage.

12:42.099 --> 12:42.898

- To our children.
- To our children.

12:58.152 --> 13:01.114
You will tell us the truth, won't you?

13:03.183 --> 13:04.611

Sure.

this probably doesn't look great.

25:29.967 --> 25:31.789

25:44.379 --> 25:46.524
Look, just please don't do this.
Okay? We'll make this right.

25:46.576 --> 25:49.476

for paying for things?

25:53.347 --> 25:56.627

Yes. Hello?

26:00.275 --> 26:01.664

fate is everything.

26:42.175 --> 26:43.131
Inevitable,

26:43.225 --> 26:45.033
inescapable destiny.

26:45.499 --> 26:47.325
You ran for a while.

26:47.362 --> 26:49.084
But here you are.

26:49.311 --> 26:52.398
Neither of us can ever get away.

26:52.803 --> 26:56.763
Nothing worse than being the son of a king.

26:57.389 --> 26:59.954
Well, maybe being the
son of a coal miner.

27:00.773 --> 27:02.153
Maybe.

27:04.638 --> 27:07.623
What would you have been if you weren't...?

27:07.653 --> 27:09.219
I'd be a doctor.

27:09.249 --> 27:10.971
A doctor. Well,

27:11.146 --> 27:12.719
I missed that.

27:14.338 --> 27:16.409
I'm-I'm drinking.

27:17.737 --> 27:20.463
I would live in a small town.

27:21.390 --> 27:23.938
And maybe... make furniture.

27:24.629 --> 27:26.126
You were good at that.

27:26.156 --> 27:28.240
We'd live in the same town.

27:28.937 --> 27:30.909
You would be the doctor.

27:31.243 --> 27:38.291
And I would make tables for
the patients to lie on.

27:38.404 --> 27:41.501
And our wives would be friends.

27:43.439 --> 27:45.946
Wouldn't you like that?

27:46.840 --> 27:47.895
Yeah.

27:48.049 --> 27:54.056
We would have been the closest
of brothers if things had been different.

27:55.310 --> 27:56.360
Yes.

27:57.863 --> 27:58.863
If.

28:09.428 --> 28:10.727
Fresh intel.

28:10.845 --> 28:14.667
Ziad's men are in place to seize control
of the three remaining bases.

28:14.757 --> 28:15.905
It's happening.

28:15.997 --> 28:18.205
I caught a load
from the secretary. I spared you.

28:18.235 --> 28:19.807
He does not appreciate being blackmailed.

28:19.882 --> 28:22.382
Well, he pulled the rug out
from under Bassam

28:22.412 --> 28:24.500
and Bassam turned the tables, you know?

28:24.530 --> 28:27.733
- They'll toast each other when it's over.
- Yeah, maybe. We'll see.

28:28.107 --> 28:29.447
I know he's a friend of yours, but

28:29.477 --> 28:32.343
usually around here, friends
make more trouble than enemies.

28:32.541 --> 28:34.702
Bassam's not Hamid Karzai.

28:34.928 --> 28:36.420
He's not Al-Maliki,

28:36.845 --> 28:37.815
okay? He's the real deal.

28:37.845 --> 28:39.397
I know it's tough in everyone's

28:39.427 --> 28:42.368
cynical calculations to process
the value of a man who actually

28:42.398 --> 28:43.510
- believes in something...
- You know, spare me, Tucker...

28:43.540 --> 28:45.826
You make that speech
from Who-Ever-Heard-of-it-Istan

28:45.856 --> 28:51.075
or wherever they send you next
when reality begins to set in in Abbudin.

28:53.359 --> 28:54.723
Excuse me.

28:58.691 --> 28:59.579
This is Tucker.

28:59.642 --> 29:00.731
I can't find Emma.

29:00.781 --> 29:02.280
She went to Azlan with my crazy sister,

29:02.330 --> 29:03.498
which I knew I shouldn't have let her do...

29:03.528 --> 29:04.724
Molly, slow down.

29:04.754 --> 29:05.477
Tell me what happened.

29:05.527 --> 29:07.188
I don't know. They went shopping.

29:07.218 --> 29:08.295
I've been calling to see if they're on time.

29:08.362 --> 29:09.683
Neither one of them are
answering their phones.

29:09.713 --> 29:11.180
I-I sent the driver to go find them.

29:11.210 --> 29:12.535
He has no idea where to look.

29:12.565 --> 29:13.850
Okay, listen to me, Molly.

29:13.880 --> 29:15.698
We need to be leaving for the airport now.

29:15.728 --> 29:17.426
I know. I know. And we'll find her,

29:17.852 --> 29:19.374
but you and Sammy need to get moving.

29:19.456 --> 29:20.745
I'm not leaving without Emma.

29:20.835 --> 29:22.338
Well, I'm gonna go
over there right now.

29:22.400 --> 29:23.603
I'm gonna find her.

29:23.985 --> 29:25.196
This isn't happening.

29:25.262 --> 29:26.379
Take a breath.

29:26.644 --> 29:28.522
Get to the airport with Sammy.

29:29.440 --> 29:32.134
Because you cannot miss your flight...
you understand me?

29:33.215 --> 29:34.422
Yeah.

29:40.741 --> 29:41.860
There we go.

29:41.890 --> 29:43.453
Our biggest one yet,

29:43.629 --> 29:44.427
no?

29:44.662 --> 29:45.784
Yup.

29:46.178 --> 29:47.736
You win.

29:48.404 --> 29:50.265
Nice job, Mr. President.

29:50.985 --> 29:52.870
We'll have a good supper tonight.

29:53.237 --> 29:54.737
We should head back now, sir.

29:54.799 --> 29:55.908
It's time.

29:58.698 --> 30:00.560
What do you say, Bassam?

30:02.067 --> 30:02.989
Sure.

30:03.039 --> 30:05.917
Unless you want to keep going.

30:06.026 --> 30:08.150
Head for open water.

30:08.911 --> 30:11.231
We can throw Salim overboard.

30:12.019 --> 30:13.351
I don't know. He's younger than us.

30:13.401 --> 30:14.385
But we are smarter.

30:14.444 --> 30:17.134
We can surprise him from behind.

30:17.663 --> 30:20.211
No one will ever find us.

30:20.950 --> 30:23.937
Let them think we've all drowned.

30:24.390 --> 30:26.506
We can live as fishermen

30:26.619 --> 30:30.813
for the rest of our lives on some island.

30:31.055 --> 30:34.327
I think we might need
to find another profession.

30:36.490 --> 30:39.617
What if I tell you I'm serious?

30:43.291 --> 30:44.974
It wouldn't work.

30:45.608 --> 30:48.066
I tried it once, remember?

30:49.526 --> 30:52.423
If there's one thing
I've learned, it's that...

30:52.841 --> 30:54.688
we all have a part to play in life.

30:55.742 --> 30:57.815
And all you can do is play it.

31:11.543 --> 31:13.000
Salim?

31:14.413 --> 31:16.650
Take us back home.

31:27.571 --> 31:29.254
Oh, God, I am in so much trouble.

31:30.214 --> 31:31.579
What time did it happen?

31:31.609 --> 31:34.283
Uh, 11:30. No, no. 11:40.

31:34.436 --> 31:35.928
- No, no. Wait, it...
- For God sakes!

31:35.958 --> 31:37.856
I'm telling you... I'm
Emma Al Fayeed.

31:37.974 --> 31:39.644
- Uh, yes, and I am Jesus Christ.
- No, you're not.

31:39.718 --> 31:40.909
He would've been more forgiving.

31:40.939 --> 31:43.072
Just go online.
Look it up, okay? I promise you.

31:43.146 --> 31:45.712
The president is my uncle.

31:46.137 --> 31:47.992
Why would the president's niece

31:48.082 --> 31:49.815
- steal from this man?
- I

31:49.845 --> 31:50.934
didn't...

31:51.461 --> 31:53.588
can you please just look it up?

31:53.618 --> 31:54.797
It'll take 30 seconds,

31:54.875 --> 31:57.437
and then you can fill out
your forms again.

31:58.872 --> 32:00.102
Please?

32:03.854 --> 32:05.107
Emma.

32:05.380 --> 32:06.387
E-m-m-a.

32:06.417 --> 32:09.400
E-m-m-a.

32:12.746 --> 32:15.354
Those are really good photos.

32:16.744 --> 32:17.978
I'm gonna get fired.

32:18.040 --> 32:20.410
- You do know that, don't you?
- I didn't..

32:20.605 --> 32:22.534
- Uh, uh, how-how could I know?!
- Can I just

32:22.608 --> 32:24.248
borrow a phone, please?

32:24.677 --> 32:26.025
Yes.

32:27.087 --> 32:27.942
Here.

32:30.070 --> 32:32.029
They just made the announcement.
The plane's about to board.

32:32.131 --> 32:33.611
Well, we found the driver.

32:33.641 --> 32:34.310
I don't know

32:34.340 --> 32:35.909
- where the hell they could've gone.
- Shit. Emma.

32:36.040 --> 32:37.805
What if something actually happened to them?

32:37.835 --> 32:40.806
I have a dozen people combing the streets.

32:41.249 --> 32:42.648
We'll find them and take them to the embassy.

32:42.678 --> 32:43.916
You need to get on the plane.

32:43.946 --> 32:46.628
Are you insane?
I'm not leaving here without my daughter.

32:48.217 --> 32:50.876
Fine, then take Sammy
and get him to the embassy.

32:50.997 --> 32:52.681
Hold on. I'm getting a call.

32:52.711 --> 32:53.739
Hello?

32:53.769 --> 32:55.893
- Mom?
- Emma?

32:55.999 --> 32:58.138
- Thank God. Are you okay?
- Yeah, we're fine.

32:58.168 --> 32:59.305
Uh, we kind of got robbed,

32:59.355 --> 33:03.265
but we're with a really nice
policeman, and, uh, it's kind of a crazy...

33:03.295 --> 33:04.534
Okay, tell me later.

33:04.564 --> 33:06.369
Right now I need you to listen
to me very carefully.

33:06.399 --> 33:07.877
Emma, stay right where you are.

33:07.907 --> 33:10.527
John Tucker's in the area.
He will come by and pick you up.

33:10.617 --> 33:11.815
Okay? I love you.

33:13.916 --> 33:15.496
You two really screwed up.

33:15.536 --> 33:17.185
It's not like
we asked to get ripped off.

33:17.243 --> 33:18.568
I don't get what the big deal is.

33:18.598 --> 33:20.651
We could've taken another flight tomorrow.

33:20.681 --> 33:22.716
I mean, what's the big deal?

33:22.985 --> 33:25.090
I'll let your sister explain it.

33:50.320 --> 33:51.768
I'm sorry, Jamal.

33:53.365 --> 33:55.929
I didn't want it to be this way.

33:56.270 --> 33:59.295
I'm doing this
to protect you from yourself.

34:10.533 --> 34:14.179
We both need
to pick our friends better.

34:16.284 --> 34:20.251
You've known Hakim for how long?
Two months?

34:20.806 --> 34:23.793
I've known him for... 15 years.

34:25.341 --> 34:28.295
Two drinks, and he confessed everything.

34:29.896 --> 34:35.022
General, you may arrest your prisoner.

34:35.052 --> 34:36.911
With pleasure, Mr. President.

34:43.377 --> 34:48.773
All afternoon on the boat, I prayed.

34:49.306 --> 34:54.289
I prayed you would change your mind.

34:56.128 --> 34:59.411
I gave you a second chance to love me.

35:01.250 --> 35:03.472
I do love you.

35:05.018 --> 35:09.118
You do not get to use that word.

35:10.969 --> 35:12.929
The funny thing is...

35:13.784 --> 35:18.036
if you had said you wanted this...

35:19.219 --> 35:21.366
my presidency...

35:22.655 --> 35:25.271
I would have given it to you.

35:27.231 --> 35:31.042
I would have given you anything.

35:36.409 --> 35:40.349
You thought you could come after
all these years and...?

35:42.529 --> 35:44.317
Take him away.

36:34.905 --> 36:35.880
Well?

36:37.634 --> 36:38.985
I don't know anything.

36:39.059 --> 36:40.824
How can that be?
You have eyes and ears everywhere.

36:40.854 --> 36:43.368
I thought that, uh,
we might have some signal

36:43.398 --> 36:46.023
from inside the Palace by now, but...

36:46.652 --> 36:47.644
We have nothing good or bad.

36:47.674 --> 36:51.454
Then again,
it's the early hours of a coup. It's...

36:51.673 --> 36:53.902
It's all confusion. That's just how it goes.

36:53.932 --> 36:55.616
I don't believe you.

36:56.193 --> 36:57.785
Tucker?

37:04.999 --> 37:06.244
What?

37:07.790 --> 37:10.082
These stations
should've gone dark by now.

37:10.219 --> 37:13.303
I don't know what it means, but

37:14.418 --> 37:17.612
something isn't going according to plan.

37:27.130 --> 37:29.385
Bassam should never
have come here.

37:30.306 --> 37:34.156
You and I both knew that from
the very beginning, didn't we?

37:36.335 --> 37:37.829
Jamal...

37:39.752 --> 37:41.651
You're both my sons.

37:42.578 --> 37:45.042
If you don't want to show him mercy...

37:46.592 --> 37:48.234
show mercy to me.

37:48.352 --> 37:50.413
You can't ask me this.

37:50.563 --> 37:52.042
I am asking you.

37:58.293 --> 37:59.648
I am begging you.

38:02.873 --> 38:04.236
Send him home.

38:04.910 --> 38:06.387
Exile them all.

38:07.144 --> 38:09.823
Is that what he would
have done for me?

38:10.545 --> 38:13.130
Or would he have murdered me?

38:15.097 --> 38:18.834
He was planning to arrest you, too.
Did you know that?

38:19.209 --> 38:20.693
And Leila.

38:21.552 --> 38:24.088
And Ahmed, your grandson.

38:24.829 --> 38:28.158
Who would have pleaded for our lives?

38:28.775 --> 38:30.586
I don't know.

38:32.558 --> 38:35.606
But that's not what happened.

38:37.795 --> 38:39.166
You are here.

38:40.501 --> 38:42.089
You are the president.

38:44.770 --> 38:47.402
You are the one who can be merciful.

38:52.310 --> 38:53.886
My gentle son.

38:59.816 --> 39:02.135
I am not your gentle son.

39:03.676 --> 39:05.046
He was.

39:05.563 --> 39:08.971
Please. Jamal.

39:09.713 --> 39:11.724
End it here...

39:12.576 --> 39:15.705
before we all murder each other.

39:28.107 --> 39:29.790
Jamal...

39:33.991 --> 39:35.644
He's still your brother.

39:45.273 --> 39:48.424
Your father has admitted
to plotting to overthrow the president.

39:48.486 --> 39:49.972
What? No.

39:50.283 --> 39:52.164
- I don't believe you.
- It's not possible.

39:52.312 --> 39:53.976
We want to talk to
you and your mother.

39:54.105 --> 39:56.518
- Me? Why? I don't know anything.
- I would prefer

39:56.607 --> 39:57.779
- that you come voluntarily.
- Ahmed...

39:59.036 --> 40:00.804
- Do you know anything about this?
- No.

40:00.834 --> 40:01.643
Come with me.

40:02.343 --> 40:04.174
- It doesn't make sense.
- Please!

40:04.264 --> 40:05.198
- Ahmed, don't let them take me.
- Why would her father do this?

40:05.228 --> 40:06.760
I swear I didn't do anything.

40:30.020 --> 40:31.597
Open.

40:47.323 --> 40:49.197
I wanted time with you...

40:49.643 --> 40:50.495
myself,

40:50.525 --> 40:54.343
before my husband is going to do
whatever he's going to do to you.

40:59.716 --> 41:01.890
I had to stop him, Leila...

41:02.458 --> 41:05.765
before he did something
that you and I couldn't fix.

41:08.623 --> 41:12.456
Between the two of
you, you are the monster.

41:13.676 --> 41:16.994
This is your democracy?
Deposing presidents?

41:17.254 --> 41:21.254
You can forget about democracy, Bassam.

41:22.324 --> 41:24.760
We'll give them a show, if
that's what they want.

41:24.790 --> 41:26.079
An election.

41:26.874 --> 41:32.254
But then Jamal will rule
this country for the rest of his life.

41:32.770 --> 41:34.480
As his father did.

41:36.405 --> 41:37.935
You're kidding yourself.

41:38.224 --> 41:40.664
You are the one
who's kidding himself.

41:41.418 --> 41:44.100
I told you I would protect my husband.

41:48.970 --> 41:50.176
Open.

41:58.481 --> 42:00.878
20 years ago, you left me.

42:01.112 --> 42:05.661
It was June,
and I cried all the way until September.

42:07.667 --> 42:10.159
And then I spent every day of my life,

42:10.381 --> 42:11.978
even though I hated you,

42:12.076 --> 42:14.341
wishing you would come back.

42:20.326 --> 42:21.622
I imagine

42:21.903 --> 42:26.300
you are going to spend the rest
of your life wishing you hadn't.

42:32.902 --> 42:34.768
Tell my family I love them.

42:36.111 --> 42:37.939
Leila, please!

42:48.632 --> 42:50.076
Thank you.

42:52.681 --> 42:56.207
There's gonna be a shit storm.
And it's all coming down on us.

43:25.037 --> 43:27.883
What does it say? Tell me.

43:33.744 --> 43:36.282
They were discovered.
I don't know how.

43:38.129 --> 43:39.917
It didn't work.

43:45.071 --> 43:46.527
Is he dead?

43:49.791 --> 43:51.954
I don't know.
I don't know anything else.

44:04.358 --> 44:05.607
Wh...

44:06.002 --> 44:07.861
so what do we do now?

44:08.943 --> 44:10.566
Where do we go?

44:12.837 --> 44:13.928
You stay here.

44:13.958 --> 44:16.224
This is the only place that's safe.

44:18.627 --> 44:20.464
They can't come for you here.

44:22.276 --> 44:23.548
For how long, Tucker?

44:39.673 --> 44:44.882
My God. Oh, my God.
No. I told you. I-I knew.

44:45.120 --> 44:46.682
I knew this would happen.

44:46.920 --> 44:48.822
No. I don't want...

44:50.028 --> 44:53.228
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

44:58.252 --> 44:59.790
I'm sorry.

45:25.641 --> 45:28.643
Please, you promised
to let me live.

45:28.995 --> 45:31.556
I told you what I know.
I told you everything.

45:31.736 --> 45:33.137
Mr. President.

45:33.368 --> 45:34.760
Jamal.

45:35.523 --> 45:36.659
Please.

45:37.076 --> 45:38.318
We are family.

45:38.818 --> 45:40.488
No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

45:40.739 --> 45:43.324
- Ready?
- Please. Wait, wait!

45:43.769 --> 45:44.996
Mr. President.

45:45.961 --> 45:47.828
Wait, wait, wait!
Mr. President, wait, wait.

45:47.963 --> 45:49.797
We are family.

45:58.340 --> 46:00.141
♪ ♪

46:25.410 --> 46:27.760
To your sons, father.

46:28.287 --> 46:30.660
Nicely done.

46:33.964 --> 46:35.986
Any last piece of advice?

46:36.065 --> 46:39.809
Or will you trust me with this one?

47:02.646 --> 47:05.122
We need to discuss your brother.

47:08.490 --> 47:11.286
There is only one punishment for treason.

47:12.711 --> 47:14.160
Mr. President,

47:14.632 --> 47:17.174
I understand how difficult
this must be for you.

47:17.643 --> 47:20.247
I spared your life, uncle.

47:20.813 --> 47:24.436
Even when I believed
you were the one betraying me.

47:25.256 --> 47:27.735
I would have advised you differently.

47:29.418 --> 47:31.027
He's still my brother.

47:31.441 --> 47:33.517
Exactly why this must be done.

47:34.107 --> 47:36.064
To show the people that no one,

47:36.263 --> 47:39.671
not even your own family, is above the law.

47:39.882 --> 47:41.389
The law?

47:46.016 --> 47:49.069
Suddenly you care about the law?

47:51.084 --> 47:55.683
What message will you send
to anyone who would try what he tried?

47:56.284 --> 47:58.244
Men in prison get out of prison.

47:58.373 --> 47:59.927
Like Tariq.

48:00.782 --> 48:03.242
Men who are exiled return.

48:03.859 --> 48:05.483
Like your brother.

48:07.943 --> 48:11.012
As long as he is alive, you are not safe.

48:12.058 --> 48:13.554
Neither am I.

48:13.820 --> 48:15.893
Or your son.

48:18.821 --> 48:20.214
Jamal.

48:33.864 --> 48:35.973
I will tell my mother first.

48:37.487 --> 48:40.654
Then I will sentence my brother to death.
