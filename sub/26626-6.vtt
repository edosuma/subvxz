11:37.697 --> 11:41.076
And sex was a sacrament.

11:41.118 --> 11:44.121
Better than eating
a piece of bread

11:44.162 --> 11:47.624
that was supposed to be the
flesh of God, if you ask me.

11:47.666 --> 11:49.209
Press didn't know
what to make of the guy

11:49.251 --> 11:50.919
and his new religion,

11:50.961 --> 11:52.671
so they named it devil worship
and called it a day.

11:52.712 --> 11:55.340
But it was so much more
than that.

11:55.382 --> 11:58.135
Thelema was more
Egyptian philosophy

11:58.176 --> 12:00.220
than Satanic sex cult.

12:00.262 --> 12:02.681
I officially converted
when I was 24.

12:02.722 --> 12:06.393
Easy choice.
Sex over of cannibalism.

12:12.732 --> 12:16.570
"Thrice Illuminated,

12:16.611 --> 12:19.656
"Thrice Illustrious

12:19.698 --> 12:23.952
and very dear Brother."

12:23.994 --> 12:26.455
I never actually met the guy,

12:26.496 --> 12:29.249
not even once
in my entire life,

12:29.291 --> 12:31.084
but we corresponded
so many times

12:31.126 --> 12:33.378
right up until he died in 1947,

12:33.420 --> 12:36.173
that I felt like I was there
in London

12:36.214 --> 12:41.511
or he was here
in Hollywood with me.

12:43.346 --> 12:45.974

Is that your Will, Jack?

12:48.268 --> 12:50.520
Magick?

12:50.562 --> 12:51.980
And science.

12:52.022 --> 12:53.982
Together.
They must be together.

12:54.024 --> 12:56.568
Magick is Will.

12:56.610 --> 12:58.695
Thelema is Will.

12:58.737 --> 13:02.949
Science is held
to different laws.

13:02.991 --> 13:05.744
You cannot Will
a rocket into space.

13:05.785 --> 13:08.747
Oh, but I did.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.957
Go on.

13:10.999 --> 13:13.168
Just like when I was eight
and summoned the Choronzon.

13:13.210 --> 13:14.753
Something.

13:14.794 --> 13:17.839
You summoned something.

13:17.881 --> 13:22.761
When I was a young man,
I summoned Satan.

13:22.802 --> 13:25.847
But your demon
looked nothing like that.

13:25.889 --> 13:29.184
Yours was different.

13:29.226 --> 13:33.855
Is that what you want, a demon?

13:33.897 --> 13:39.694
No. I-It, I mean,
when I was eight, yeah.

13:39.736 --> 13:44.032
Dimensional portal
into another universe.

13:44.074 --> 13:47.911
Like this one, but different.
I-I think that's what I did.

13:47.953 --> 13:52.791
I opened a window, a-a hole,
a wrinkle into the multiverse.

13:57.170 --> 14:00.799
Newton posited that God
made worlds of various sorts.

14:00.840 --> 14:04.594
Ah, a God thing.

14:04.636 --> 14:07.097
Uh, no.
Actually, a-a science thing.

14:07.138 --> 14:11.434
-And it's gaining in popularity.
-God and science.

14:11.476 --> 14:14.813
Make up your mind.

14:14.854 --> 14:17.482
What about her?

14:17.524 --> 14:20.610
The Scarlet Woman.
She was there, when I was eight,

14:20.652 --> 14:23.029
and yesterday, in the explosion
after my spell.

14:23.071 --> 14:26.241
-That is magick and science.
-Hmm.

14:26.283 --> 14:28.785
Aleister.

14:28.827 --> 14:31.830
Magick is just science
we haven't figured out yet.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.582
There's no difference.

14:33.623 --> 14:36.042
No "and," no "but."
T-They are the same.

14:36.084 --> 14:40.964
Is that what your engineers
tell you, too, Jack?

14:41.006 --> 14:43.466
You know they don't.

14:43.508 --> 14:46.011
Do they laugh at you

14:46.052 --> 14:48.013
to the launchpad?

14:48.054 --> 14:51.391
They are men of logic.
Logic...

14:51.433 --> 14:53.435
...is a really good way
to be wrong with confidence.

14:53.476 --> 14:56.771
I made you
the leader of my temple

salvation is not science,
