WEBVTT

00:00.834 --> 00:02.835
The perfect guy
is out there somewhere.

00:02.920 --> 00:04.170
Let's go hunt him down.

00:04.254 --> 00:06.130
I just don't feel
ready for all this.

00:07.049 --> 00:08.925
Hey, my name's
Emmett Byrd.

00:09.009 --> 00:10.635
I think you
may be my dad.

00:10.719 --> 00:12.136
This is a catastrophe.

00:14.682 --> 00:17.934
You might have had a son
that loved you, Randall.
But you'll never know.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.686
I'll be better off.

00:20.354 --> 00:23.231
Got a test. To see if
I re-qualify for Squad.

00:23.399 --> 00:24.607
So, you're going to
what, just...

00:24.692 --> 00:26.359
Quit the ambo and
drop me as a partner?

00:26.443 --> 00:28.611
If I'm approved?
Honestly, yeah.

00:44.294 --> 00:46.587
You want a table,
or sit at the stage?

00:47.965 --> 00:50.800
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm here to see Jack.

00:50.926 --> 00:52.176
Jack Nesbit.

00:52.261 --> 00:53.845
Cool. Give me a sec.

01:00.519 --> 01:03.563
So, this used to be
a dead space before
the last renovation.

01:03.647 --> 01:06.232
I was thinking to myself,
I got all this just
sitting here.

01:06.483 --> 01:08.234
Expansion?
Exactly.

01:08.318 --> 01:10.570
I don't wanna turn anyone
away looking for a drink
and a good time,

01:10.654 --> 01:13.948
but our safety regulations
and fire codes...

01:14.032 --> 01:16.659
I know all about it.
I'm a firefighter.

01:17.828 --> 01:18.870
What house?

01:20.247 --> 01:21.330
51.

01:21.749 --> 01:22.999
I was 114.

01:23.417 --> 01:25.126
You're kidding.
Wabash?

01:25.210 --> 01:26.502
Seven years.

01:27.629 --> 01:28.671
That's great!

01:29.173 --> 01:31.048
Yeah, time
of my life.

01:31.341 --> 01:32.383
Seriously.

01:32.968 --> 01:33.968
Until this.

01:34.052 --> 01:35.136
Well...

01:36.972 --> 01:38.055
So, anyway, uh...

01:38.182 --> 01:41.267
I'm looking for a bid.
I want this room
to look like out there,

01:41.351 --> 01:42.477
only better.

01:42.561 --> 01:44.187
How much you
looking to spend?

01:44.396 --> 01:46.022
Tell me what you
think it'll take.

01:46.690 --> 01:48.524
You want something
to drink, boss?

01:51.195 --> 01:53.070
Can't. Second
watch tomorrow.

01:53.864 --> 01:56.199
Good man. Uh, scotch
and soda, Trish.

01:56.283 --> 01:57.575
Hold the lemon. Thanks.

02:09.838 --> 02:11.130
Hey, Kelly.

02:12.841 --> 02:13.925
Scott.

02:14.510 --> 02:15.718
I'm ready.

02:16.595 --> 02:17.678
What?

02:18.889 --> 02:21.682
Look, you said
to tell you when
I'm ready. So, uh...

02:22.559 --> 02:23.601
I'm ready.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.373
Gabby, let's go.

02:49.503 --> 02:51.087
I haven't worn this in
almost a year.

02:51.171 --> 02:52.296
This is my favorite
little black dress.

02:52.589 --> 02:53.756
Hot.

02:53.841 --> 02:55.299
I mean, I love the turnout
gear, but it feels like

02:55.384 --> 02:57.176
it's all I'm ever changing
into these days.

02:57.261 --> 03:00.721
Well, there is no way to feel
attractive in EMS trousers.

03:01.807 --> 03:04.058
You know what we need?
A night on the town.

03:05.185 --> 03:06.644
A night on
the town. Yes!

03:06.728 --> 03:08.980
Yeah. And, uh, I'm not
gonna steal you from Cruz.

03:09.064 --> 03:10.231
So, he can come,
too, yeah?

03:10.399 --> 03:11.399
You sure?

03:11.483 --> 03:12.775
A wing-man
and a wing-woman?

03:12.943 --> 03:14.735
This is gonna
be awesome.

03:21.785 --> 03:22.869
Hey, can I help you?

03:22.953 --> 03:24.328
I'm looking for
Randy McHolland.

03:24.413 --> 03:25.454
Yeah.

03:25.789 --> 03:27.582
Uh... Mouch.

03:36.133 --> 03:37.216
That's me, Emmett.

03:42.014 --> 03:43.055
I'm Randall.

03:43.932 --> 03:45.433
I'm, uh, your father.

03:45.559 --> 03:47.101
No, man. You're
not my father.

03:47.394 --> 03:49.186
I apologize. Uh...

03:49.730 --> 03:50.897
Birth father,

03:51.023 --> 03:53.107
I guess I should...
Yeah, no, you're
not that, either. Uh...

03:53.442 --> 03:55.776
My half-sister
is your birth kid.

03:57.821 --> 03:59.864
I'm a little protective,
so I wanted to

04:00.115 --> 04:01.407
reach out,
meet you first.

04:01.491 --> 04:02.992
Suss you out.
Man, I'm glad I did.

04:03.994 --> 04:06.913
So, it wasn't her
left sitting in that
diner like some sucker.

04:08.373 --> 04:09.749
Uh, yeah, I'm real
sorry about that.

04:09.833 --> 04:11.876
No, don't bother
with excuses. I just...

04:13.170 --> 04:15.463
I came here to say
that 'cause you're
too chicken to show,

04:15.547 --> 04:17.423
you'll never get
a chance to meet

04:17.507 --> 04:18.841
the sweetest,
coolest girl.

04:35.025 --> 04:36.067
Morning, Chief.

04:36.860 --> 04:37.860
Morning.

04:39.196 --> 04:40.780
You sound too
damn perky,

04:40.864 --> 04:42.823
like a man that
doesn't have a
baby at home.

04:44.201 --> 04:45.326
I have some great news.

04:45.410 --> 04:46.702
Rice is ready to
get back to work.

04:47.245 --> 04:48.287
Scott Rice.

04:48.372 --> 04:50.539
Yeah. And we
got a slot to
fill on Squad, so...

04:52.417 --> 04:53.459
Who says he's ready?

04:54.169 --> 04:55.211
He does.

04:57.255 --> 04:58.881
Look, if he says
he's ready, then
I believe him.

05:00.676 --> 05:02.301
Okay. I'll think on it.

05:02.803 --> 05:05.221
Known him since
before CFD,
back to high school.

05:05.555 --> 05:06.806
He's as stand-up
as they come.

05:07.224 --> 05:08.599
I said I would
think on that.

05:11.478 --> 05:12.937
Squad 3,
Truck 81...

05:13.021 --> 05:16.148
Let's go.
Ambulance 61, Battalion 25.
Vehicle accident.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.078
- Hey.
- What do we got?

05:29.287 --> 05:31.247
He's up there,
uh, level three.

05:31.415 --> 05:32.873
He says his
accelerator got stuck.

05:32.958 --> 05:35.626
Ran right into the shoring
holding a fresh slab
of concrete.

05:35.711 --> 05:38.004
Okay, you heard the man.
He is three floors up.

05:38.088 --> 05:39.547
We need to assess
the situation,

05:39.631 --> 05:41.340
and walk in with whatever
tools we need.

05:41.425 --> 05:42.800
61, bring
your stretcher.

05:42.884 --> 05:43.926
Got it, Chief.

05:44.136 --> 05:46.053
Uh, Dawson,
with me.

05:49.558 --> 05:50.641
We gotta work fast.

05:50.726 --> 05:52.435
We don't know
how long that
van will hold up.

05:52.769 --> 05:54.270
Watch for loose debris.

05:55.022 --> 05:57.273
Hey, stop! Easy, guys.
We got it from here. Stop!

06:01.278 --> 06:02.319
Those tires
haven't blown yet.

06:02.404 --> 06:03.446
All right.

06:03.530 --> 06:04.947
Hey, buddy.

06:05.407 --> 06:07.366
Can you move
your legs?
Yeah.

06:07.451 --> 06:08.909
All right, get a
C-collar on him.

06:08.994 --> 06:10.036
Copy that.

06:11.288 --> 06:13.164
Check the other vehicles.

06:13.707 --> 06:14.707
All clear.

06:14.791 --> 06:17.334
Capp, we need
extraction tools
up on P-three.

06:17.419 --> 06:19.045
Saw, spreaders.

06:20.547 --> 06:22.006
Fall back, now!

06:33.560 --> 06:35.311
That shoring's gonna
fail any second.

06:35.479 --> 06:37.063
Hey, guys,
hold it.

06:37.147 --> 06:38.647
All this is
unstable.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.483
Chief, we need to
reinforce that slab.

06:40.650 --> 06:42.276
Maybe we should
improvise a truss.

06:42.611 --> 06:44.111
Let's get all the
cribbing and
struts we can get.

06:44.321 --> 06:45.821
Bring up all the cribbing,
everything we got.

06:45.906 --> 06:46.906
Got it.
Right away.

06:48.492 --> 06:49.658
Okay.

06:50.619 --> 06:52.578
Hey, they're gonna
need every pair of
hands they can get.

06:53.789 --> 06:54.955
Think we got enough?

06:55.040 --> 06:56.123
Hope so.

06:59.711 --> 07:00.920
Hang in there, buddy.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.019
I'm telling you, there's not
enough time for this.

07:17.104 --> 07:18.187
Let me pull him out
through the back.

07:19.022 --> 07:20.106
Okay, hurry up.

07:20.190 --> 07:21.607
If I say bail, you bail.

07:21.691 --> 07:22.733
Okay.

07:33.870 --> 07:36.247
Severide. Backboard.

07:38.667 --> 07:39.708
I can give you a hand.

07:39.793 --> 07:41.418
No, no! Hey, stay
back, stay back.

07:41.837 --> 07:44.004
Capp! I need you!

07:52.597 --> 07:53.722
Hang on.

07:57.769 --> 07:59.228
I got you.

08:02.858 --> 08:04.358
Severide, bail out!

08:06.820 --> 08:08.904
Ready? One, two three.

08:13.618 --> 08:14.994
Here, buckle him in.

08:15.954 --> 08:17.413
We got him, Chief!

08:20.125 --> 08:21.292
Tony, Herrmann,
get in here!

08:21.376 --> 08:22.418
Coming in!

08:23.253 --> 08:24.753
Capp, you go first.

08:31.469 --> 08:32.678
Chief!

08:32.804 --> 08:34.555
Okay, I got you.

08:44.858 --> 08:47.067
You okay?
I'm good.

08:57.954 --> 08:59.038
Yeah.
He's an old friend.

08:59.122 --> 09:00.456
I'm trying to get him
on board Squad.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.166
Ah, Rice over at 31?

09:02.250 --> 09:03.751
Used to be there?
Yeah, he's a great guy.

09:03.919 --> 09:05.211
That man can
tell a story.

09:05.754 --> 09:07.087
From what I remember,
Rice is the kind of guy

09:07.172 --> 09:08.505
that always had to be
center of attention.

09:08.715 --> 09:10.966
Ah! Come on, you'd
love working with him.

09:14.596 --> 09:15.721
Scott Rice.

09:16.806 --> 09:18.974
Isn't he the one that got
into a fight during a call

09:19.059 --> 09:21.185
and threw some guy out
a third-story window?

09:21.269 --> 09:22.895
Yes!
Can the gossip.

09:23.313 --> 09:25.397
Severide wouldn't bring him
in here if he was a problem.

09:26.775 --> 09:28.025
Wait, who are
we talking about?

09:28.318 --> 09:29.777
Uh, Severide's buddy,
Scott Rice.

09:29.861 --> 09:31.862
He might be taking
Newhouse's old spot on Squad.

09:33.573 --> 09:34.615
Newhouse's?

09:35.242 --> 09:36.283
You mean,
my old spot?

09:41.998 --> 09:43.123
Mmm-hmm.

09:43.625 --> 09:45.542
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

09:45.710 --> 09:47.127
That just got
the ball rolling.

09:47.629 --> 09:50.381
Rice is gonna join us
for a shift. Trial run.

09:50.674 --> 09:52.424
Yeah, that's great!
No, and...

09:52.509 --> 09:54.134
Chief, don't worry,
Rice is gonna bust
his hump for us.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.594
Okay.

09:55.679 --> 09:56.845
Hey, Chief,
you got a sec?

09:57.597 --> 09:58.681
Yeah.

09:58.848 --> 10:00.849
I heard, uh, we got an
open spot on Squad.

10:01.184 --> 10:02.268
I just wanted to
let you know,

10:02.352 --> 10:04.186
I haven't had any signs
of vertigo for a while.

10:04.980 --> 10:06.105
I'm getting another
medical eval

10:06.189 --> 10:07.481
to see if I get
cleared for duty.

10:07.857 --> 10:09.024
You're seeing
the doctor?

10:09.442 --> 10:10.985
It's on the books,
end of the week.

10:11.861 --> 10:13.862
That's good to hear.
Yeah, so...

10:14.364 --> 10:16.657
You know, don't make any final
decisions about anything.

10:16.992 --> 10:19.368
You just
tell me what the doctor says.

10:19.828 --> 10:21.036
All right, will do.

10:21.162 --> 10:22.705
End of the week.
Yeah.

10:27.544 --> 10:30.713
Joe, what do you think about
a night out on the town

10:30.797 --> 10:32.756
with two hot ladies
as your escorts?

10:33.633 --> 10:34.758
Huh...

10:35.135 --> 10:36.760
Wait. Is this a test?

10:37.220 --> 10:38.637
'Cause I'm a one-woman
man, baby.

10:38.763 --> 10:39.888
No, no, I'm serious.

10:40.015 --> 10:41.140
Me and Dawson are
talking about

10:41.224 --> 10:42.808
a fun night out tomorrow.

10:42.892 --> 10:45.853
Hit some of the hot spots,
do some dancing.

10:46.104 --> 10:48.272
What do you say?
Uh... Well, to be honest,

10:48.773 --> 10:52.484
I would much rather hang out
at Molly's for a beer,

10:52.569 --> 10:53.610
and then head home

10:53.695 --> 10:54.820
and watch the Blackhawks
game with you.

10:55.905 --> 10:56.905
Really?

10:58.283 --> 10:59.825
Hey, but you
guys should go,

11:00.243 --> 11:01.285
if you want.

11:03.204 --> 11:04.246
Okay.

11:04.706 --> 11:05.748
Great.

11:06.374 --> 11:07.416
I will.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.209
I messed everything up.

11:09.294 --> 11:11.211
Don't give yourself such
a hard time, Mouch.

11:11.296 --> 11:14.506
Yeah. You did a great
thing way back when.

11:14.591 --> 11:18.427
You gave someone a child
who really wanted one.

11:18.511 --> 11:19.678
Bottom line is,

11:19.763 --> 11:21.263
your obligation
ended there.

11:21.514 --> 11:23.265
Did it? 'Cause
this is crazy.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.267
I can't suddenly
become a parent.

11:25.352 --> 11:27.061
I'm a middle-aged man!

11:29.856 --> 11:31.648
Oh, you're different.
You have a wife,

11:31.733 --> 11:33.359
and you're...
You're mature.

11:33.443 --> 11:35.819
I was scared, too.
Still am, every single day.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.155
The fear doesn't go away?

11:38.615 --> 11:40.574
Look, there's no
logic to parenthood.

11:40.950 --> 11:42.534
None. Look at this.

11:43.453 --> 11:45.037
Intellectually, I know
and understand that

11:45.121 --> 11:47.373
a two-hour old baby is
not an attractive thing.

11:47.999 --> 11:49.958
Looks like a little
old man, but to me...

11:51.711 --> 11:54.254
It's my son and...

11:57.759 --> 11:59.843
Damn it, Mouch,
I haven't slept in weeks.

12:01.388 --> 12:03.389
It's not like you're gonna
be staying up all night

12:03.473 --> 12:04.515
and changing diapers.

12:04.599 --> 12:07.184
This is an adult
we're talking about
here, all right?

12:07.685 --> 12:09.978
For all we know,
she already has a dad.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.731
Maybe she just
wanted to meet somebody
with her own DNA.

12:13.483 --> 12:14.691
Shake your hand.

12:17.195 --> 12:18.487
Yeah.

12:28.998 --> 12:30.582
I wanna give this
thing a shot.

12:33.962 --> 12:35.003
Attaboy.

12:43.763 --> 12:44.805
Hey.

12:45.432 --> 12:46.849
There he is.
What's up, stranger?

12:47.225 --> 12:49.017
What's up?
What's up, man?

12:50.395 --> 12:51.437
How you doing?
Good to see you.

12:51.521 --> 12:52.729
There he is,
there he is.
Hey!

12:52.814 --> 12:54.148
Rice. How's it going?

12:54.274 --> 12:56.358
Hey, man. How you been?
How you doing? Hey.
Oh! Oh!

12:57.193 --> 12:58.569
You know, I still got
a scar from Lee Henry,

12:58.653 --> 13:00.487
when he walloped me
with a stick last picnic.

13:01.239 --> 13:03.115
All right? That kid
in juvie yet?

13:03.199 --> 13:04.491
Nah, he'd bust
out too quick.

13:04.576 --> 13:06.243
I'm thinking more
like San Quentin.

13:06.327 --> 13:08.495
Hey, nothing wrong
with an ex-con in
the family, right?

13:08.621 --> 13:10.789
Yeah.
Wait, wait. You guys know
about my Aunt Francie?

13:10.874 --> 13:13.208
Uh, the one who held
up a liquor store when
she was 65?

13:13.293 --> 13:14.418
Come on, man.
Get out of here.

13:14.502 --> 13:16.378
I've heard that story
three times at least.

13:16.463 --> 13:18.130
I'm telling you,
Aunt Francie,
she gets it in her head

13:18.214 --> 13:21.175
that she needs a little
convertible Mustang for
her later years.

13:21.384 --> 13:22.801
So, I kid you not,
she gets up one morning,

13:22.886 --> 13:24.720
she pulls a panty hose
over her head.

13:26.306 --> 13:29.475
And uh... You know,
I'm gonna finish
this later, guys.

13:29.726 --> 13:32.769
It involves a car
full of Siamese cats
and a drunken nun.

13:32.854 --> 13:34.062
I swear to God,
you're gonna love it.

13:35.648 --> 13:36.690
Friendly guy.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.235
Chief Boden.

13:41.362 --> 13:42.571
Rice.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.574
Welcome.
Thanks.

13:48.536 --> 13:50.329
I appreciate you taking
a flyer on me like this.

13:51.664 --> 13:52.789
I imagine you

13:52.916 --> 13:56.043
think twice when you
hear a guy's got a conduct
unbecoming on his file.

13:57.337 --> 13:58.670
Plus, with all the
rumors that are flying...

13:59.088 --> 14:00.422
I don't listen
to rumors.

14:00.507 --> 14:01.673
But I do listen
to my men,

14:01.758 --> 14:03.342
and Severide pushed
very hard for you.

14:04.636 --> 14:05.928
I'm real grateful
to him for that.

14:07.388 --> 14:08.639
Can't wait to
prove him right.

14:11.309 --> 14:12.351
Good.

14:12.769 --> 14:13.810
Thank you, sir.

14:18.816 --> 14:20.817
There's a ton
of clubs in that
neighborhood.

14:21.194 --> 14:23.612
What are you...
You ladies looking
for some hot spots?

14:24.072 --> 14:26.114
Mmm-hmm.
'Cause I'm your resource.

14:26.407 --> 14:28.033
Oh, really?
Yeah.

14:28.201 --> 14:29.618
Well, go ahead.
What have you got?

14:29.702 --> 14:31.495
Okay. Uh, let's see.

14:31.579 --> 14:33.372
How about The Den?

14:36.000 --> 14:38.961
Closed in December of 2008.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.589
Really? Um,
okay, how about...

14:42.799 --> 14:46.009
Oh. Underworld.
That place gets wild.

14:46.094 --> 14:48.720
You know, Sylvie, you gotta
dress nice if you wanna
get past the bouncers.

14:48.805 --> 14:50.722
Closed in '09.

14:50.932 --> 14:53.517
Oh, but it sounds like you
had a good year of clubbing.
Congrats, man.

14:53.601 --> 14:55.143
I don't see you coming
up with any suggestions.

14:55.228 --> 14:56.645
Hey, my clubbing
days are over.

14:56.729 --> 14:57.980
I'm happy at home

14:58.273 --> 15:00.274
with my girl,
a nice cold beer,

15:00.358 --> 15:01.525
and a good game on TV.

15:04.195 --> 15:05.904
Hey, you know
who's working over
at Chicago Med?

15:06.364 --> 15:08.490
Who?
April Sexton.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.159
April Sexton?
Are you kidding me?

15:11.703 --> 15:13.745
Man, I've been
trying to track her
down for years.

15:14.414 --> 15:15.455
Who is she?

15:15.832 --> 15:18.041
Oh, the girl no one
could get a date with
in high school.

15:18.209 --> 15:20.002
Smart, serious student.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.336
But somehow,

15:21.504 --> 15:22.671
she and this
guy were tight.

15:22.880 --> 15:24.631
Just... Severide, Sexton.

15:24.716 --> 15:27.134
We ended up sitting
next to each other
in all our classes.

15:27.385 --> 15:28.677
So, you guys were...

15:28.845 --> 15:29.845
No, just...

15:30.096 --> 15:31.805
Just good friends.

15:32.140 --> 15:33.765
Uh-huh?
Chicago Med?

15:34.267 --> 15:36.351
Yep. In the E. R.

15:40.356 --> 15:42.441
He called me
a couple times,

15:42.525 --> 15:45.277
but problem is,
it came up as
"Caller ID Blocked."

15:45.361 --> 15:47.654
So, I can't
just hit return.

15:48.072 --> 15:49.615
I'm sure you
can understand,

15:49.699 --> 15:52.451
we need to be
vigilant about
privacy here.

15:52.535 --> 15:54.161
I can't give you
that information.

15:55.872 --> 15:58.707
You weren't so vigilant
about my privacy.

15:59.542 --> 16:00.584
As I explained,

16:01.502 --> 16:03.420
the young man got your
number as the result

16:03.504 --> 16:05.589
of an unfortunate
security breach.

16:05.757 --> 16:07.424
We very much
regret it.

16:08.593 --> 16:09.635
Here's the thing,

16:10.720 --> 16:14.765
I wasn't as receptive
as I should have been

16:14.849 --> 16:16.600
when this kid, Emmett,
first reached out.

16:16.684 --> 16:20.520
And the truth is, closest
thing I've ever had
to children is Pouch,

16:20.605 --> 16:23.815
and I forget to walk her
about 60% of the time.

16:23.900 --> 16:25.567
So, of course,
I'm thinking,

16:25.652 --> 16:27.152
what kind of
father would I be?

16:27.612 --> 16:29.237
Pouch is...
Our dog.

16:29.614 --> 16:30.697
And she's a real beauty, too.

16:30.782 --> 16:32.199
She's got these...

16:39.082 --> 16:40.582
You're not gonna give
me the number, are you?

16:41.292 --> 16:43.168
I'm very sorry,
Mr. McHolland.

16:44.796 --> 16:46.129
Maybe he'll
call again.

16:46.506 --> 16:47.589
Hmm.

16:51.260 --> 16:53.679
So, I look up, and now
I got three options.

16:54.013 --> 16:56.515
I can A, hand this guy $100.

16:56.724 --> 16:59.226
B, turn the bucket
over and reveal that
I do not, indeed,

16:59.310 --> 17:01.061
have a two-headed
monkey under there.
Or C,

17:01.187 --> 17:03.605
I can run the hell out of
there as fast as I can.

17:04.107 --> 17:05.232
Oh my God,
what did you do?

17:05.316 --> 17:06.525
D, none of the above.

17:06.901 --> 17:09.027
But this is where
things get really,
really interesting.

17:09.112 --> 17:11.279
Just as I'm about to
turn tail and vamoose,

17:11.447 --> 17:13.615
right then, two other
guys walk in the room.

17:14.117 --> 17:16.410
First guy, I mean,
he's got fists on him
like watermelons.

17:16.661 --> 17:17.744
Second guy's got this

17:17.829 --> 17:18.954
scowl on his face...
Hello?

17:19.831 --> 17:21.540
Oh, hey. Um, yeah.

17:22.417 --> 17:24.126
Do you have
a second?

17:24.335 --> 17:26.461
And the guy in the
cowboy hat. No,
not even... Hang on.

17:26.546 --> 17:29.047
The guy in the cowboy hat,
he looks right at me.
You know what he says?

17:29.132 --> 17:30.298
Up, up, up. Yeah.

17:30.967 --> 17:32.801
Casey. So...

17:33.261 --> 17:36.054
I talked to Weathersby over
at 59. He confirms it.

17:36.764 --> 17:39.224
Confirms what?
The, uh... The Rice thing.

17:40.309 --> 17:41.476
Throwing the guy
out the window.

17:42.311 --> 17:43.395
Weathersby was there?

17:43.646 --> 17:45.147
Well, no.
But his cousin

17:45.231 --> 17:47.774
worked at 31
same time as Rice.

17:48.317 --> 17:49.735
So, Weathersby's cousin

17:49.819 --> 17:51.862
saw Rice throw a
guy out a window?

17:51.946 --> 17:53.196
Well, not directly.

17:53.281 --> 17:56.366
He was searching
the basement. But
there are witnesses.

17:57.034 --> 17:58.702
All right? The guy ended
up in a wheelchair.

17:59.287 --> 18:01.329
Let Severide worry
about Rice, huh?

18:01.831 --> 18:02.914
Fine.

18:03.583 --> 18:06.168
But if he cracks and
he punches somebody,
don't blame me.

18:07.336 --> 18:08.378
Why would I blame you?

18:13.426 --> 18:14.593
Hey.
Hey.

18:15.511 --> 18:17.345
Scott Rice. I'm
filling in on Squad.

18:17.430 --> 18:18.472
Yeah.

18:18.556 --> 18:21.850
Peter Mills. I'm...
Paramedic.

18:22.727 --> 18:24.019
Columbo's got
nothing on me.

18:28.524 --> 18:30.192
You and Severide
go way back, huh?

18:30.985 --> 18:33.445
Yeah. Way, way back.

18:37.033 --> 18:38.950
Ambulance 61, Squad 3.

18:39.035 --> 18:41.203
Look at us, Peter.
Working together already.

18:41.287 --> 18:42.621
30 Grand Street.

19:04.352 --> 19:06.061
Are you the only
ones they sent?

19:06.229 --> 19:08.104
Rescue Squad's right
behind us. Where's the victim?

19:08.189 --> 19:10.273
This way. He's one
of our stagehands.

19:10.483 --> 19:12.025
Got hit in the
head with a light.

19:12.318 --> 19:14.861
One of these folks?
Oh. No, no, no.

19:15.238 --> 19:16.613
Him, up there.

19:16.739 --> 19:18.073
Help me, I'm slipping!

19:20.284 --> 19:21.827
Hey! Hey,
don't move!

19:21.911 --> 19:23.495
Hurry, man,
I can't hold on!

19:23.579 --> 19:24.996
Squad, what's
your ETA?

19:25.081 --> 19:27.082
We're just
turning onto Grand now.

19:27.750 --> 19:28.792
I got this.

19:29.418 --> 19:30.710
Mills, they'll be
here in a minute.

19:30.795 --> 19:32.462
Yeah, well, a
minute's too long.

19:32.588 --> 19:34.714
He's got a head injury.
He could black out and fall.

19:35.091 --> 19:36.258
Is that really
a good idea?

19:36.843 --> 19:37.926
I'm fine, Brett.

19:40.513 --> 19:41.721
Hurry, man!

19:58.948 --> 20:00.031
Mills?

20:10.501 --> 20:12.168
What's he waiting for?

20:13.129 --> 20:14.796
He's... He's just
being cautious.

20:14.922 --> 20:16.464
A person can get
dizzy up there.

20:20.636 --> 20:21.803
I'm good.

20:25.349 --> 20:26.391
Help! Help!

20:26.475 --> 20:28.727
Hey, buddy. Hang on.
I'm coming, okay?

20:28.811 --> 20:30.812
Bastard hurts!
I know, I'm coming.

20:37.403 --> 20:39.279
I got him!

20:39.363 --> 20:40.697
Hey. All right.

20:44.327 --> 20:45.577
Hey, where is he?

20:46.495 --> 20:47.495
There.

20:49.540 --> 20:50.582
Mills?

20:52.710 --> 20:53.752
What the hell's
he doing?

20:54.253 --> 20:55.337
Rice, come on.

20:59.884 --> 21:02.302
Mills. Hey.
We got it from here.

21:25.868 --> 21:27.035
All right,
we got you, buddy.

21:27.119 --> 21:28.536
All right?
Don't look down.

21:32.375 --> 21:33.416
All right.

21:35.878 --> 21:38.380
So, no dizziness?
No signs of vertigo?

21:38.464 --> 21:39.631
Nothing at all.

21:39.715 --> 21:41.800
I looked straight down.
It didn't even faze me.

21:45.805 --> 21:47.555
Hey.
Hey.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.891
Just had a phone call
from a Jack Nesbit.

21:49.976 --> 21:51.059
Looking for
references for you.

21:51.143 --> 21:52.310
Yeah. You know him?

21:52.395 --> 21:55.438
Know of him. Just want to
let you know, I told him
that you were no good.

21:56.732 --> 21:58.733
Perfect! Didn't
want the job anyway.

21:58.818 --> 22:00.860
Middle of winter,
jobs in Chicago
are easy to get.

22:00.945 --> 22:03.655
You're okay. I told him
you're an honest man, that
you're a great lieutenant.

22:03.739 --> 22:05.323
Thank you, Chief.
What I really wanna know is,

22:05.408 --> 22:06.908
why are you dancing
at a strip club?

22:08.452 --> 22:10.870
I will be working
adjacent to a strip club.

22:11.831 --> 22:13.915
They're renovating.
It's a construction gig...

22:15.251 --> 22:16.251
Never mind.

22:16.877 --> 22:17.919
Carry on.

22:19.714 --> 22:22.090
And the guy
in bed three is pretending
he doesn't speak English.

22:22.174 --> 22:23.341
Don't buy it.

22:23.426 --> 22:25.093
All right. Radiology still
hasn't called me back.

22:25.177 --> 22:27.721
I'm gonna walk down
there so they have to
ignore me face to face.

22:27.805 --> 22:28.972
I'll be right back.

22:29.306 --> 22:30.348
April.

22:36.897 --> 22:38.481
Wow, Kelly!

22:41.944 --> 22:43.278
How are you doing?
You look good.

22:44.280 --> 22:46.698
Good. Uh, good.

22:48.576 --> 22:50.201
I heard you
were a firefighter.

22:50.327 --> 22:51.619
Yeah, I'm over on 51.

22:51.787 --> 22:53.163
Scott Rice is
there, too.

22:54.874 --> 22:56.458
Look, a bunch of us
are getting together

22:56.542 --> 22:57.834
at Molly's Pub in
Bucktown after shift.

22:57.918 --> 22:58.960
You should come by.

23:00.004 --> 23:01.713
No, I don't think so.

23:01.881 --> 23:03.673
What are you
talking about?
It'll be fun. Why not?

23:05.259 --> 23:06.468
Because you suck.

23:07.803 --> 23:08.803
Hey!

23:08.929 --> 23:10.055
What was that? Hey.

23:10.306 --> 23:11.473
Hey, April.
Kelly.

23:12.516 --> 23:13.767
It actually takes
being a good friend

23:13.851 --> 23:15.018
to earn my forgiveness.

23:17.188 --> 23:18.480
I gotta get back to work.

23:22.068 --> 23:23.109
April.

23:24.236 --> 23:25.987
One drink.

23:30.993 --> 23:32.452
I'm sorry.

23:32.912 --> 23:35.163
I should've told
you at the start.

23:35.998 --> 23:38.416
Honey, I love you
fierce like a lion.

23:38.501 --> 23:42.128
But honesty is
extremely important
to me when warranted.

23:42.755 --> 23:44.964
It won't happen
again, I promise.

23:46.092 --> 23:47.342
Okay.

23:49.303 --> 23:50.386
I don't know
what to do.

23:51.347 --> 23:54.641
I can't track down
Emmett's number.
Clinic won't help.

23:54.725 --> 23:56.226
Oh, God,
that's too bad.

23:57.520 --> 24:01.272
If only you knew
someone very attractive
in law enforcement

24:01.357 --> 24:04.984
who could track
down his contact
information for you.

24:10.241 --> 24:12.659
Trudy, you are, by far,

24:12.743 --> 24:14.452
the best, most...
Okay, stop.

24:14.537 --> 24:16.538
...amazing...
Stop it.

24:17.790 --> 24:18.957
Why'd you stop?

24:25.047 --> 24:26.089
Thank you.

24:28.050 --> 24:30.176
Hey, Gabby, aren't you
gonna come dance?

24:30.344 --> 24:32.512
Yeah. I'm just looking
for my friend.

24:32.596 --> 24:34.139
Uh, I feel like
I'm neglecting her.

24:34.223 --> 24:36.307
She's not really into
the club thing and...

24:36.392 --> 24:38.768
Has a boyfriend at home.
Who?

24:38.853 --> 24:40.395
The girl you
came here with?

24:41.063 --> 24:42.230
Her?

25:11.093 --> 25:12.760
Who are you
waiting for? Rice?

25:13.220 --> 25:15.722
No. Rice doesn't go
out much these days.

25:17.224 --> 25:19.809
Hey, did he
really throw a guy

25:20.102 --> 25:22.437
out the third-story
window?
No.

25:22.938 --> 25:24.355
The window was
on the first floor.

25:26.942 --> 25:29.444
It was some
meth-head who
just went off on him.

25:30.237 --> 25:33.239
It was mostly self-defense.
Guy walked away with
a few stitches.

25:33.574 --> 25:34.949
So, he wasn't
in a wheelchair?

25:35.284 --> 25:36.492
He was,

25:36.577 --> 25:38.077
right until the judge
threw out his lawsuit.

25:38.204 --> 25:40.121
Then he could
walk just fine.

25:40.915 --> 25:42.498
Hey, Lieutenant,
you got a sec?

25:43.918 --> 25:44.959
Yeah.

25:47.213 --> 25:48.338
Um...

25:50.674 --> 25:51.799
What's up, bud?

25:52.092 --> 25:53.927
You saw me on
the catwalk, right?
Yeah.

25:55.804 --> 25:56.804
My vertigo is gone.

25:57.848 --> 25:59.557
I can climb as high as
I want, no problem.

26:00.059 --> 26:01.684
That's great. But...

26:03.020 --> 26:04.270
Listen, you gotta stop
overstepping your

26:04.355 --> 26:05.772
bounds out there, Mills.
You're gonna get hurt.

26:05.856 --> 26:07.732
Oh, that's what
I'm trying to tell you.
That, um...

26:08.692 --> 26:10.068
It was just
a temporary problem.

26:11.237 --> 26:14.155
I'm, uh, retrying out
for Squad physical.

26:15.115 --> 26:16.157
Good.

26:17.076 --> 26:18.117
Good.

26:18.702 --> 26:20.036
So, you gotta save
that spot for me.

26:21.538 --> 26:22.747
Mills, I can't
do that, man.

26:22.831 --> 26:24.165
Yeah, of course,
you can.

26:26.794 --> 26:27.835
Look, I...

26:28.420 --> 26:30.421
I mean,
I know that...

26:30.965 --> 26:32.006
Rice is your buddy.

26:34.426 --> 26:36.427
But I earned that
spot with hard work.

26:37.263 --> 26:39.347
And an injury shouldn't
knock me out for good,

26:39.682 --> 26:40.848
not if I get
the all-clear.

26:43.477 --> 26:44.644
Rice has the job.

26:47.856 --> 26:49.357
And he needs it,
trust me.

26:50.776 --> 26:51.901
I need it too.

27:07.001 --> 27:08.042
Thank you.

27:12.548 --> 27:13.965
I'd like another chance.

27:16.552 --> 27:17.635
Forget it.

27:17.761 --> 27:19.971
I shouldn't have left
you hanging, Emmett.
I screwed up.

27:20.556 --> 27:22.640
Yeah. I know that part.
Anything else?

27:24.268 --> 27:25.393
The thing is...

27:28.522 --> 27:30.023
I was terrified.

27:30.691 --> 27:31.691
I mean,

27:31.817 --> 27:35.194
a week ago, I had
no idea I had a kid.

27:36.155 --> 27:37.238
You understand?

27:38.741 --> 27:40.033
I mean, anyone
who isn't

27:40.117 --> 27:42.577
freaked out in
that situation
has a screw loose.

27:42.911 --> 27:44.620
Oh, yeah? Well,
you should have
pushed through it.

27:44.705 --> 27:46.914
You're right. 100%.

27:47.916 --> 27:51.044
And that's what
I'm doing now.
I'm pushing through.

27:52.671 --> 27:53.713
I just want...

27:55.299 --> 27:56.799
I just want
another chance

27:57.593 --> 27:58.843
to get to know
my daughter.

28:02.639 --> 28:04.098
Look, Emmett, I...

28:04.350 --> 28:05.850
I can't tell
you if I'll be

28:05.934 --> 28:08.561
the best father,
'cause I've never
been one before.

28:09.938 --> 28:11.105
But I can tell you

28:11.231 --> 28:14.192
how I am with the
family I have at
Firehouse 51.

28:14.276 --> 28:16.277
I'd lay my life on
the line for them.

28:18.989 --> 28:20.740
Lizzie may be
my kid sister,

28:21.325 --> 28:23.993
but she's saved
my ass more times
than I could count.

28:24.661 --> 28:25.870
So, I mean...

28:26.455 --> 28:27.997
She's the best.

28:47.017 --> 28:48.518
Don't screw this up.

28:52.648 --> 28:53.856
Thank you.

29:37.067 --> 29:38.693
Still dehydrated.

29:38.986 --> 29:41.320
It's gonna be a
long 24 hours.

29:41.655 --> 29:44.449
Hey! How'd
it go, huh?

29:44.533 --> 29:47.618
Did you guys go to the
place with the vodka frozen
in the blocks of ice?

29:47.703 --> 29:48.911
Oh, yeah.

29:48.996 --> 29:52.832
We were the only ones
there besides a table
full of five old Russian men.

29:52.916 --> 29:54.500
Huh. No wonder
Baba loves it.

29:54.585 --> 29:57.420
Yeah, we went to a bunch
of different places and
ended up at Bubble Lounge.

29:57.546 --> 29:59.672
Oh, I've heard that
place is awesome.

30:00.048 --> 30:01.841
That place is crazy
fun, I gotta say.

30:02.176 --> 30:04.635
Bubble Lounge?
No, that place is way
too loud and crowded.

30:04.720 --> 30:06.012
You couldn't
pay me.

30:06.096 --> 30:08.514
Cruz, when did you
turn 100 years old?

30:12.769 --> 30:13.811
Huh?

30:21.403 --> 30:23.279
Mills. Hey. Uh...

30:24.781 --> 30:26.741
Hey, I don't
want any bad
blood between us.

30:27.326 --> 30:29.619
Yeah, neither
do I, Lieutenant.

30:30.496 --> 30:31.787
Didn't mean
to overstep.

30:34.374 --> 30:36.459
I'm gonna do
whatever it takes
to get my spot back.

30:38.670 --> 30:39.837
Yeah, I respect that.

30:41.131 --> 30:42.256
And fact is,

30:42.549 --> 30:43.883
Boden makes
the final call.

30:44.343 --> 30:45.468
So, let's just

30:46.678 --> 30:47.803
play it by
ear, right?

30:48.222 --> 30:49.263
Sounds good.

30:49.556 --> 30:50.598
You get tested?

30:50.766 --> 30:51.933
End of the week.

30:53.435 --> 30:55.686
Hey. Squad's gonna
make a run.
Quick errand.

30:55.771 --> 30:56.771
Okay.

31:00.776 --> 31:01.859
You still suck.

31:01.944 --> 31:03.361
I'm not a good
friend? Really?

31:03.946 --> 31:04.946
What the hell
is that?

31:05.030 --> 31:06.239
Eminem tickets.

31:07.157 --> 31:09.659
I took you to that concert
for your 17th birthday,
you remember?

31:09.826 --> 31:10.868
And I hated Eminem.

31:10.953 --> 31:13.287
You did not.
You were just
intimidated by his talent.

31:13.622 --> 31:16.332
Please.
Then why did you steal
my Slim Shady CD?

31:16.458 --> 31:18.251
So, you
would quit playing it!

31:19.711 --> 31:21.420
I cannot believe
you kept these.

31:21.547 --> 31:23.172
Yeah.

31:27.261 --> 31:28.886
My parents still
ask about you.

31:33.475 --> 31:34.517
Damn, I gotta get
down to Radiology.

31:34.601 --> 31:36.227
Well, hey. Um, let me...

31:36.311 --> 31:37.562
Let me take you
out for a drink
sometime.

31:37.646 --> 31:39.146
There's more I wanna
talk to you about.

31:39.439 --> 31:40.565
About what?

31:42.401 --> 31:45.778
I never really got
to thank your parents.

31:48.240 --> 31:49.365
Never got
to thank you.

31:54.162 --> 31:56.330
Okay. Well,
you just did.

31:56.832 --> 31:57.957
Accepted.

31:59.835 --> 32:01.085
It's good to
see you, Kelly.

32:08.719 --> 32:10.511
Okay. Yeah, great,
I'll be there.

32:10.971 --> 32:12.513
Um, hey,
thanks again.

32:13.765 --> 32:14.974
Is that the
doctor's office?

32:15.684 --> 32:16.726
Uh, yeah.

32:18.645 --> 32:21.105
Severide sounded
pretty supportive
this morning.

32:21.523 --> 32:22.815
He might be
shining me on.

32:23.358 --> 32:24.400
You think so?

32:24.735 --> 32:27.278
It's fine. I got my
appointment pushed
up to tomorrow.

32:27.696 --> 32:29.405
I'm gonna get my
medical clearance,

32:29.489 --> 32:31.282
and then I will cram
it down their throats.

32:32.743 --> 32:33.826
That's the spirit.

32:36.079 --> 32:38.664
- Ambulance 61.
- Person in distress.

32:52.679 --> 32:54.138
You gotta help him!

32:54.473 --> 32:56.474
My Joey, he
swallowed a quarter!

32:56.600 --> 32:58.351
Not a quarter,
Momma, a key!

32:58.435 --> 33:00.728
I told you to stay
with your brother.
Get back inside.

33:00.812 --> 33:01.812
Where's Joey?

33:01.897 --> 33:03.105
He's inside,
this way.

33:03.732 --> 33:04.857
How old is Joey?

33:04.983 --> 33:06.442
He's, uh, 31.

33:14.993 --> 33:16.077
Oh, Lord!

33:18.246 --> 33:19.705
What's wrong
with Daddy?

33:20.916 --> 33:23.626
Upstairs.
Go on, kids. All of you.

33:23.710 --> 33:25.086
What are they
doing to Daddy?

33:34.513 --> 33:35.596
I see it.

33:35.764 --> 33:37.264
It's past the
vocal chords,

33:37.349 --> 33:38.516
deep in the airway.

33:38.600 --> 33:40.101
All right, try and
grab it with forceps.

33:40.435 --> 33:41.519
Okay, hang on.

33:47.442 --> 33:48.901
Okay, hurry up,
he's not breathing.

33:49.569 --> 33:50.945
It keeps moving
further in.

33:51.405 --> 33:52.405
All right, if you
can't get it out,

33:52.489 --> 33:54.865
you're gonna need
to grab an ET tube
and push it in all the way.

33:54.950 --> 33:57.159
All the way?
Yeah. It'll go into the right
or the left bronchial,

33:57.244 --> 33:58.536
but at least he'll
be able to breathe
with one lung

33:58.620 --> 33:59.704
until we transfer
him for surgery.

33:59.788 --> 34:01.122
Okay, let me try
it one more time.

34:06.294 --> 34:07.878
Got it.

34:12.634 --> 34:13.801
Come on up, buddy.

34:20.475 --> 34:23.519
I was trying to show
the kids a magic trick.

34:23.603 --> 34:25.771
Joey, don't talk.
Just rest.

34:26.273 --> 34:28.816
Oh, hey, that's not
contagious, is it, hon?

34:28.984 --> 34:31.819
'Cause, uh, my kids'll
catch anything just
from looking at it.

34:31.987 --> 34:33.112
Oh, uh...

34:33.363 --> 34:34.822
No, it's just a
hand stamp.

34:34.906 --> 34:36.991
My girlfriend and
I went out dancing
the other night.

34:37.075 --> 34:38.242
Oh, dancing.

34:39.202 --> 34:40.703
Can't remember
the last time I
went dancing.

34:40.829 --> 34:43.038
Mommy, I wanna show
you something.
Okay. Okay.

34:43.331 --> 34:45.583
Brett, you ready?
Let's go.

34:46.293 --> 34:47.835
Mommy, come on.

34:49.463 --> 34:52.673
Thank you for hanging out
with me the other night.
I had so much fun.

34:52.799 --> 34:54.008
I had a great
time, too.

34:54.134 --> 34:55.593
Dancing and meeting people.

34:55.677 --> 34:57.762
It's actually...
It's exactly what I need.

35:01.391 --> 35:02.433
Hey.

35:03.810 --> 35:05.019
What's wrong?
You okay?

35:05.979 --> 35:07.813
I love that black
dress of yours.

35:08.523 --> 35:10.441
I mean, I always say
to myself that I'm gonna

35:10.692 --> 35:12.735
buy a sexy
little black dress.

35:12.861 --> 35:14.403
Then I get to the store,

35:14.696 --> 35:16.697
and I end up
getting the same
thing I always do.

35:17.199 --> 35:19.283
You know, something
nice, not too daring.

35:19.409 --> 35:20.701
Something comfortable.

35:21.745 --> 35:23.579
Well, you can
always borrow it.

35:25.916 --> 35:29.335
The point is, I need
to stop falling back
on comfortable

35:29.711 --> 35:31.879
and nice. You know?

35:33.006 --> 35:34.089
Why?

35:34.633 --> 35:37.426
I mean, if you really
like something,
what's wrong with that?

35:40.472 --> 35:43.849
I came to Chicago
to start a whole
new life for myself.

35:44.935 --> 35:47.937
But somehow, I've ended
up back on the couch,

35:48.021 --> 35:50.105
watching movies
with my boyfriend.

35:56.613 --> 35:58.072
I adore Cruz.

35:58.615 --> 36:01.700
I'm so lucky to have
him in my life,
and I know that.

36:02.786 --> 36:03.911
But it's...

36:05.747 --> 36:07.122
It's not
the life I want.

36:11.419 --> 36:14.797
I did the Dix-Hallpike test
a couple times at home.
No problem.

36:16.132 --> 36:18.551
I'm telling you,
Doc, no vertigo.

36:18.635 --> 36:20.261
Well, we're gonna
find out for sure.

36:20.595 --> 36:21.679
We'll start here,

36:21.763 --> 36:23.764
and then we'll go
upstairs for an ENG.

36:24.766 --> 36:25.766
ENG?

36:25.892 --> 36:29.436
We use electrodes to
assess your ocular and
vestibular systems.

36:29.688 --> 36:31.021
After that,
we'll do an MRI.

36:31.106 --> 36:32.273
When the results
come back,

36:32.399 --> 36:34.608
I'll consult
with the board...
But wait, Doctor Gochman,

36:35.277 --> 36:36.944
I thought I was gonna
get an answer today.

36:37.654 --> 36:38.821
I mean,

36:38.905 --> 36:40.865
when you took me out
of action, you made
the call like that.

36:40.949 --> 36:42.032
Unfortunately,

36:42.492 --> 36:44.660
clearing you for duty
is a bit more of a process.

36:45.453 --> 36:46.871
You may feel fine,

36:47.122 --> 36:48.330
but if there's any
trace of vertigo,

36:48.415 --> 36:49.999
we can't let you
work Squad.

36:51.960 --> 36:53.002
Okay.

36:53.795 --> 36:55.296
Either way, you'd know
in about a week.

36:56.214 --> 36:57.256
A week?

36:59.217 --> 37:01.969
Okay, let's get started.
Come on back.

37:03.138 --> 37:05.639
Turn your head.
Okay, there we go.

37:15.901 --> 37:17.818
- Matt, hey.
- Hey.

37:17.903 --> 37:19.486
Come on over.
Thanks.

37:19.821 --> 37:22.156
So, uh, here's
my bid.

37:22.282 --> 37:25.159
There's probably some
wiggle room in some
of the material costs.

37:25.285 --> 37:27.411
If I can get my
supplier to play ball.

37:27.495 --> 37:28.829
You got the job.

37:30.957 --> 37:32.082
You don't want
to take a look?

37:32.167 --> 37:33.667
I like you, Matt,
I trust you.

37:34.085 --> 37:35.252
Now, what are
you drinking?

37:36.421 --> 37:38.088
Uh...
Come on.

37:38.798 --> 37:40.841
You're drinking.
We're celebrating.

37:42.302 --> 37:43.385
Well...

37:43.511 --> 37:44.553
Thank you.

37:44.846 --> 37:46.347
Don't make me ask you
what you're having again.

37:46.431 --> 37:47.598
Scotch on the rocks.

37:47.682 --> 37:49.350
Kiki, two scotch
on ices, please.

37:49.517 --> 37:50.559
No lemon?

37:50.644 --> 37:51.727
That's my girl.

38:00.779 --> 38:01.904
Cheers.

38:14.334 --> 38:16.585
It means a whole lot,
you coming here with me.

38:17.337 --> 38:19.254
Terror's a little
less paralyzing.

38:19.547 --> 38:21.423
Hey, I'm excited about
this too, you know?

38:21.883 --> 38:23.050
If this works out,

38:23.802 --> 38:26.261
I'll have a girl I
can share my hair
and makeup tips with.

38:29.599 --> 38:31.475
You're going
to the bathroom now?
What if she walks in?

38:31.643 --> 38:33.644
No, honey, I'm not
going to the bathroom.
I'm leaving.

38:34.854 --> 38:37.523
I got you here,
but you gotta
do this alone.

38:39.025 --> 38:40.567
I don't know if I can.

38:40.694 --> 38:42.361
I mean, I'm getting a
little tight right here.
Okay.

38:42.737 --> 38:43.821
Randall.

38:46.825 --> 38:48.951
It is time to be
the man I know
you can be.

39:18.314 --> 39:19.523
Lizzie?

39:34.622 --> 39:35.622
Hi.

39:49.763 --> 39:51.138
You're so pretty.

39:51.973 --> 39:53.140
Have a seat.

39:56.853 --> 39:58.145
Don't even
say it, Chief.

39:59.064 --> 40:00.105
I got a cold glass
in my hand.

40:00.190 --> 40:01.356
Thank you, Brian.

40:02.192 --> 40:03.650
Say, Chief,

40:04.110 --> 40:05.277
can I ask you something
51 related,

40:05.361 --> 40:06.403
or would you
rather chillax?

40:06.488 --> 40:08.197
'Cause I can totally
respect that.
No, go on.

40:08.281 --> 40:09.490
Hit me with it.

40:10.867 --> 40:11.992
It's Rice.

40:13.578 --> 40:17.247
Now, I'm the last guy
to stand in the way of
Severide and his buddy.

40:17.332 --> 40:19.583
But the things I
hear about this guy.

40:19.667 --> 40:21.085
Why, what'd
you hear?

40:21.961 --> 40:24.379
He threw a man through
a window, Chief. Now...

40:24.672 --> 40:26.757
All signs point
to a ticking time bomb...

40:26.841 --> 40:28.550
There were mitigating
circumstances.

40:28.635 --> 40:30.385
I heard it was
self-defense.

40:30.470 --> 40:31.929
But you know as
well as I do,

40:32.013 --> 40:33.430
that there are many ways
to diffuse a situation.

40:33.515 --> 40:35.766
It was one week after
his wife died.

40:40.063 --> 40:41.105
Oh...

40:43.149 --> 40:44.191
Really?

40:44.859 --> 40:47.152
Wow.
Left him with a
four-year-old son.

40:52.575 --> 40:55.327
Yeah, Angie's sister
helps out a lot. Whoa!

40:56.204 --> 40:58.205
She has a pretty
flexible schedule, so

40:59.082 --> 41:00.666
she watches Logan
for me most days.

41:01.417 --> 41:03.710
And then if she
can't do it,

41:03.920 --> 41:05.337
Mom always
just fills in.

41:06.881 --> 41:08.799
I mean, one way or
another, you
just figure it out.

41:11.386 --> 41:13.011
Ooh! Let's color
this instead.

41:13.388 --> 41:14.471
Yeah? Instead?

41:14.681 --> 41:16.014
Ooh, this is pink.

41:16.391 --> 41:17.516
He seems happy.

41:18.393 --> 41:20.853
Yeah.
Yeah, he is.

41:22.188 --> 41:23.772
I think we're gonna be
all right, me and him.

41:30.989 --> 41:32.239
Uh...

41:32.323 --> 41:33.740
Look, thanks for
this chance, Kelly.

41:35.910 --> 41:37.411
I really needed it.

41:41.541 --> 41:42.583
I know.

41:46.880 --> 41:48.255
Oh! You're gonna
let him do that?

41:48.464 --> 41:49.840
Hey.
