WEBVTT

00:00.900 --> 00:04.300
* Here in my car, I feel safest of all *

00:04.335 --> 00:05.982
* I can lock all my doors

00:06.017 --> 00:07.630
* It's the only way to live

00:07.665 --> 00:09.100
* In cars...

00:15.630 --> 00:17.425
Whatcha doin'?

00:17.460 --> 00:20.330
Building an original 1978 Firebird.

00:20.365 --> 00:22.330
Got it on eBay.

00:22.365 --> 00:23.562
Okay.

00:23.597 --> 00:24.725
Why?

00:24.760 --> 00:27.045
I had this model when
I was little, remember?

00:27.080 --> 00:29.330
I spent a month building
it and painting it

00:29.365 --> 00:30.525
and putting on all the decals.

00:30.560 --> 00:33.260
Is that the one I tried
to make a bong out of?

00:34.060 --> 00:36.600
No, that was my Munster Mobile.

00:37.400 --> 00:39.465
And my ventriloquist dummy.

00:39.500 --> 00:42.080
And my Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots.

00:42.115 --> 00:44.625
My Firebird you blow-torched

00:44.660 --> 00:47.130
with a cigarette lighter
and Mom's Aqua Net.

00:47.165 --> 00:50.365
Oh, yeah, the "Fire"- bird.

00:50.400 --> 00:53.430
Anyway, I loved that model and
now I'm gonna have it again.

00:54.460 --> 00:56.430
I am gonna have it again, right?

00:56.465 --> 00:57.725
Relax.

00:57.760 --> 00:59.165
If I destroy any of your cars,

00:59.200 --> 01:01.130
it'll be that
oil-dripping piece of crap

01:01.165 --> 01:02.630
out there in my garage.

01:04.400 --> 01:06.030
* Here in my car

01:06.065 --> 01:07.582
* I can only receive

01:07.617 --> 01:09.065
* I can listen to you

01:09.100 --> 01:11.060
* It keeps me stable for days *

01:11.095 --> 01:12.130
* In cars...

01:16.560 --> 01:18.760
I'm worried about my brother.

01:19.830 --> 01:21.725
- Why?
- Well...

01:21.760 --> 01:23.365
he's either so lonely,

01:23.400 --> 01:25.365
he's trying to recapture his childhood,

01:25.400 --> 01:28.495
which was not that
good in the first place,

01:28.530 --> 01:31.600
or he's created an elaborate
ruse to hide the fact

01:31.635 --> 01:33.830
that he's become a
degenerate glue-sniffer.

01:35.230 --> 01:37.195
To be honest, I'm rootin' for the glue.

01:37.230 --> 01:39.830
You know, I've been meaning
to talk to you about him.

01:39.865 --> 01:40.962
You want him gone? He's gone.

01:40.997 --> 01:42.628
That's how much I love you.

01:42.663 --> 01:44.225
No, no, he's a wonderful guy.

01:44.260 --> 01:47.830
I actually have a friend that I
think might be a good match for him.

01:47.865 --> 01:49.832
Oh, no, you're wrong.

01:49.867 --> 01:51.800
Oh, come on, Charlie.

01:52.630 --> 01:55.565
Listen...

01:55.600 --> 01:57.380
*... started to think

01:57.415 --> 01:59.125
* About leaving tonight

01:59.160 --> 02:01.430
* Although nothing seemed...

02:02.500 --> 02:05.400
You don't want to do
that to a friend, do you?

02:05.435 --> 02:06.695
Alan's a doll.

02:06.730 --> 02:08.530
He just needs to find the right woman.

02:08.565 --> 02:10.164
If you check his closet,

02:10.199 --> 02:12.500
you'll find the right woman is a doll.

02:12.535 --> 02:14.465
At least let me try.

02:14.500 --> 02:16.430
I'll set up a dinner
with the four of us.

02:16.465 --> 02:17.460
It'll be fun.

02:17.495 --> 02:18.825
For who?

02:18.860 --> 02:20.700
It's bad enough you want
to punish your friend.

02:20.735 --> 02:22.265
Why do I have to suffer?

02:22.300 --> 02:24.400
Isn't it worth one night of your life

02:24.435 --> 02:26.100
to maybe make two people happy?

02:26.135 --> 02:27.065
That's not fair.

02:27.100 --> 02:28.125
I always come off bad

02:28.160 --> 02:30.600
when I answer questions
like that truthfully.

02:30.635 --> 02:33.000
Just do it for me.

02:34.200 --> 02:35.360
Is that a yes?

02:38.660 --> 02:40.630
Remember those words
when we go to bed tonight.

02:40.665 --> 02:41.595
What words?

02:41.630 --> 02:44.200
"Just do it for me. "

02:46.060 --> 02:47.825
So, anyway,

02:47.860 --> 02:50.630
he's Charlie's brother
and a very sweet guy

02:50.665 --> 02:52.300
and I really think you'll like him.

02:54.130 --> 02:57.130
Boy, I don't know.

02:57.165 --> 02:58.725
Blind dates.

02:58.760 --> 03:02.130
You never know what kind of
freak you're gonna end up with.

03:04.000 --> 03:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:11.200 --> 03:13.160
- So you don't know her name?
- Nope.

03:13.230 --> 03:15.200
- And you don't know what she does?
- Nope.

03:15.260 --> 03:16.660
And you don't know what she looks like?

03:16.730 --> 03:18.000
What do you care?

03:18.060 --> 03:20.060
You were gonna spend the
night building a scale model

03:20.130 --> 03:22.330
of The Dukes of Hazzard car.

03:24.330 --> 03:25.225
actually. I just finished it

03:25.260 --> 03:27.300
Now I'm working on
Burt Reynolds' Trans Am

03:27.335 --> 03:28.830
from Smokey and the Bandit.

03:29.530 --> 03:32.525
Okay, okay, just promise me

03:32.560 --> 03:34.600
you won't bring any of that up tonight.

03:34.635 --> 03:36.660
Why? Why?!

03:38.100 --> 03:41.230
You're asking me why a
40-year-old man shouldn't talk

03:41.265 --> 03:43.200
about model cars on a first date?

03:45.130 --> 03:46.195
I see your point.

03:46.230 --> 03:48.680
Leave a little mystery.

03:48.715 --> 03:51.130
Yeah, that's my point.

03:51.165 --> 03:52.295
Come on.

03:52.330 --> 03:53.625
Oh, speaking of mystery,

03:53.660 --> 03:54.995
I am currently the high bidder

03:55.030 --> 03:58.330
on an original, mint in the
box Scooby-Doo Mystery Machine.

04:03.900 --> 04:04.725
How do I look?

04:04.760 --> 04:06.330
Don't open that can of worms.

04:06.365 --> 04:08.560
You are what you are.

04:09.830 --> 04:12.160
There's Chelsea.

04:13.930 --> 04:15.815
- Sorry we're late.
- No, no,

04:15.850 --> 04:17.700
- we were early.
- You look great!

04:17.735 --> 04:19.730
Thank you. So do you.

04:24.030 --> 04:26.200
Charlie, Alan, this is my friend Rose.

04:26.235 --> 04:27.165
Rose,

04:27.200 --> 04:29.200
this is Charlie and Alan.

04:29.235 --> 04:31.200
It's nice to meet you, Alan.

04:31.700 --> 04:33.815
No, that's Charlie.

04:33.850 --> 04:35.930
Ooh, even better.

04:35.965 --> 04:36.960
Hi, Alan.

04:36.995 --> 04:39.160
Hi.

04:40.230 --> 04:42.560
Why don't we all sit down?

04:42.595 --> 04:45.430
So many reasons.

04:47.200 --> 04:49.560
Chelsea's told me so
much about you boys.

04:49.595 --> 04:51.525
It-It's so nice to finally meet you.

04:51.560 --> 04:55.260
Alan, I understand
you're a chiropractor.

04:57.030 --> 04:58.995
Yes.

04:59.030 --> 05:02.130
I'm a chiropractor.

05:02.165 --> 05:03.797
Charlie?

05:03.832 --> 05:05.395
Yes.

05:05.430 --> 05:08.395
He is a chiropractor.

05:08.430 --> 05:10.930
Oh, that's just terrific.

05:10.965 --> 05:13.430
And what do you do, Charlie?

05:13.465 --> 05:15.195
Um...

05:15.230 --> 05:18.460
I write kids' songs and jingles.

05:18.495 --> 05:20.977
Alan?

05:21.012 --> 05:23.460
Yes.

05:24.300 --> 05:26.800
He writes kids' songs and jingles.

05:29.400 --> 05:31.430
And I am a chiropractor.

05:34.060 --> 05:37.760
Yes, he's a chiropractor.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.360
They don't get out much, do they?

05:41.395 --> 05:43.695
Apparently not.

05:43.730 --> 05:46.930
So, Chelsea, where did you meet...

05:46.965 --> 05:48.897
Rose.

05:48.932 --> 05:50.830
Right.

05:52.930 --> 05:55.595
Rose.

05:55.630 --> 05:56.580
Yoga class.

05:56.615 --> 05:57.530
No kiddin'.

05:57.565 --> 05:58.665
Yeah.

05:58.700 --> 06:01.000
And then we ran into
each other at Pilates,

06:01.035 --> 06:02.200
and the manicurist,

06:02.235 --> 06:03.895
and jogging,

06:03.930 --> 06:05.260
and the dry cleaner.

06:05.295 --> 06:06.895
Crazy, huh?

06:06.930 --> 06:08.930
Sure are. Sure is.

06:10.600 --> 06:13.780
Seemed like every time I
turned around, there she was.

06:13.815 --> 06:16.960
Seemed like every time I
turned around, there you were.

06:16.995 --> 06:19.030
I thought maybe you were stalking me.

06:23.630 --> 06:25.545
That's funny.

06:25.580 --> 06:27.460
Good one. Yeah.

06:28.960 --> 06:31.510
Can I start you off with cocktails?

06:31.545 --> 06:34.060
I think I need to stay sober tonight.

06:34.095 --> 06:35.977
But you guys go ahead.

06:36.012 --> 06:37.506
I'll have a Chardonnay.

06:37.541 --> 06:39.000
I'll be right back.

06:40.130 --> 06:41.465
I'll go with you.

06:41.500 --> 06:43.500
I'll have a double vodka rocks.

06:44.300 --> 06:47.200
I feel a little reckless tonight.

06:48.260 --> 06:50.260
Fun personality, huh?

06:50.295 --> 06:52.625
Yeah.

06:52.660 --> 06:56.060
Unfortunately, she's
got six more of them.

06:56.095 --> 06:57.647
And for you, sir?

06:57.682 --> 06:59.165
Whiskey, neat.

06:59.200 --> 07:00.900
Since when do you drink hard liquor?

07:00.935 --> 07:02.325
Since right now.

07:02.360 --> 07:05.060
I'd order a glass of crack
if it were on the menu.

07:06.230 --> 07:09.265
Tru dat.

07:09.300 --> 07:11.450
Why didn't you say something?

07:11.485 --> 07:13.600
I was following your lead.

07:13.635 --> 07:14.795
What lead?

07:14.830 --> 07:16.700
The minute I saw her, I
practically peed my pants.

07:16.735 --> 07:18.647
Well then, I did follow your lead.

07:18.682 --> 07:20.560
So-So what are we going to do now?

07:20.595 --> 07:21.895
I don't know.

07:21.930 --> 07:23.100
I guess we play along.

07:23.135 --> 07:24.225
Play along?!

07:24.260 --> 07:25.225
Are you serious?!

07:25.260 --> 07:26.800
What am I supposed to do, Alan?

07:26.835 --> 07:27.665
Tell the truth?

07:27.700 --> 07:29.565
"Oh Chelsea, I almost forgot,

07:29.600 --> 07:31.665
"your new BFF and I
had a one-night stand

07:31.700 --> 07:33.930
"and when I dumped her,
she superglued my nutsack

07:33.965 --> 07:35.700
"to my thigh and started stalking me.

07:35.735 --> 07:37.095
"Oh, and then

07:37.130 --> 07:38.860
"I thought maybe I was in love with her

07:38.895 --> 07:40.065
"and followed her to England.

07:40.100 --> 07:41.625
"And then when she
came back from England,

07:41.660 --> 07:44.130
I thought I was dying and
almost asked her to marry me. "

07:44.165 --> 07:46.600
Yeah, when you put it in story form,

07:46.635 --> 07:47.900
it really does sound bad.

07:47.935 --> 07:50.325
So, we play along

07:50.360 --> 07:52.430
until I can find out
what Rose's angle is.

07:52.465 --> 07:54.460
So, what, I'm supposed to date her?!

07:54.495 --> 07:55.727
Stop flattering yourself.

07:55.762 --> 07:56.925
This isn't about you.

07:56.960 --> 07:58.095
It's me she's interested in.

07:58.130 --> 07:59.600
What are you saying, I'm
not good enough for her?

07:59.635 --> 08:01.325
What are you saying,

08:01.360 --> 08:02.960
you want that looney
tune as a girlfriend?

08:02.995 --> 08:03.925
No!

08:03.960 --> 08:06.130
But I am currently unattached.

08:08.760 --> 08:10.365
Now, you listen to me,

08:10.400 --> 08:12.660
this is a blind date
that goes no further.

08:12.695 --> 08:13.700
You understand?

08:13.735 --> 08:15.330
I got it.

08:19.760 --> 08:21.760
She really likes him.

08:21.795 --> 08:23.160
Swell.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.100
I thought there was real
chemistry between them.

08:42.135 --> 08:45.030
I'm sure they have some meds in common.

08:46.800 --> 08:49.260
But I wouldn't get your hopes up.

08:49.295 --> 08:51.265
Why not?

08:51.300 --> 08:52.415
She's not his type.

08:52.450 --> 08:53.495
What do you mean?

08:53.530 --> 08:56.130
She's pretty, smart, rich...

08:56.165 --> 08:58.730
Okay, then, he's not her type.

09:05.260 --> 09:07.300
This is crazy.

09:07.335 --> 09:08.725
I know.

09:08.760 --> 09:10.330
We just met.

09:30.800 --> 09:33.465
Oh no, no,

09:33.500 --> 09:36.030
no, you idiot.

09:36.065 --> 09:38.560
Morning, Charlie.

09:38.595 --> 09:40.300
Morning.

09:42.030 --> 09:44.060
Should've smothered him in the crib

09:44.095 --> 09:46.460
when I had the chance.

09:48.330 --> 09:50.730
Boy, take one day off
for a poker tournament

09:50.765 --> 09:52.930
And you miss a whole lot around here.

09:54.800 --> 09:56.425
You said you were sick.

09:56.460 --> 09:58.500
I was healed. It's a miracle.

09:58.535 --> 10:01.425
You want to catch me up?

10:01.460 --> 10:03.610
Chelsea set Alan up on a blind date

10:03.645 --> 10:05.602
With a girl she met at yoga class.

10:05.637 --> 10:07.560
Well, what's he doing with Rose?

10:07.595 --> 10:09.360
She's the girl.

10:11.360 --> 10:13.560
Diabolical.

10:14.730 --> 10:16.695
So Chelsea doesn't know...

10:16.730 --> 10:19.430
Chelsea knows nothing and
I want to keep it that way.

10:19.465 --> 10:20.895
Okay.

10:20.930 --> 10:22.880
Why is Alan playing along?

10:22.915 --> 10:24.830
Because Alan is a horny idiot.

10:26.030 --> 10:28.100
And horny idiots are perfectly willing

10:28.135 --> 10:30.200
to have sex with crazy girls.

10:31.230 --> 10:33.130
Yeah, I know. But I've grown.

10:34.660 --> 10:36.700
Charlie, did you see?

10:36.735 --> 10:38.825
Yeah, I saw.

10:38.860 --> 10:40.700
Told you they'd hit it off.

10:40.735 --> 10:41.660
Didn't I tell you?

10:41.695 --> 10:43.165
You told me.

10:43.200 --> 10:46.360
I'm a little worried
they're moving so fast.

10:46.395 --> 10:48.962
Yeah, that's the worrisome part.

10:48.997 --> 10:51.530
Berta, have you met Rose yet?

11:03.030 --> 11:05.230
Screw it, I'm going home.

11:07.230 --> 11:09.000
Feel better!

11:15.730 --> 11:18.145
Cut it out!

11:18.180 --> 11:20.560
Stop it.

11:25.130 --> 11:26.930
Hello.

11:26.965 --> 11:28.695
Sit down.

11:28.730 --> 11:31.025
Um, you know I have company.

11:31.060 --> 11:33.600
Yes, I know you have
company, now, sit down!

11:36.060 --> 11:38.400
Okay.

11:47.260 --> 11:49.100
'Sup?

11:52.200 --> 11:53.765
Explain it to me, Alan.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.330
Help me understand.

11:55.365 --> 11:57.125
You mean Rose?

11:57.160 --> 11:59.460
No, I mean the internal
combustion engine!

11:59.495 --> 12:00.900
Yes, Rose!

12:03.200 --> 12:05.465
Uh, well, we, uh, we started talking

12:05.500 --> 12:08.800
On the ride home last night,
and we really hit it off.

12:08.835 --> 12:10.400
She has changed, Charlie.

12:10.435 --> 12:12.925
Changed?!

12:12.960 --> 12:14.365
She was stalking my fiance.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.430
Ah, ah, well, actually,
she explained all that.

12:16.465 --> 12:17.647
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

12:17.682 --> 12:19.391
What did she say?

12:19.426 --> 12:21.065
Uh, well, um...

12:21.100 --> 12:22.365
Okay, I don't remember all the details

12:22.400 --> 12:24.400
'cause she was tweaking
my nipples at the time.

12:26.960 --> 12:29.065
Oh... Hi, Charlie.

12:29.100 --> 12:32.700
All right, Rose, what are you up to?

12:32.735 --> 12:33.765
What do you mean?

12:33.800 --> 12:36.295
I'm telling you right now,

12:36.330 --> 12:38.960
I love Chelsea and if you
mess things up with us,

12:38.995 --> 12:40.400
I will never forgive you.

12:40.435 --> 12:42.095
Wow.

12:42.130 --> 12:44.560
What did I ever do to deserve that?

12:46.500 --> 12:47.860
You're kidding, right?

12:47.895 --> 12:49.430
Yeah.

12:53.460 --> 12:55.310
So, once again,

12:55.345 --> 12:57.125
What are you up to?

12:57.160 --> 12:59.510
Okay, at first, I was just doing

12:59.545 --> 13:01.825
A little light recon on Chelsea

13:01.860 --> 13:04.030
To make sure you weren't
dating a whack job.

13:04.065 --> 13:07.760
You thought Chelsea might be...

13:07.795 --> 13:09.595
Go on.

13:09.630 --> 13:12.025
Well, good news, she's not.

13:12.060 --> 13:14.165
She's got a cousin
who's a truck stop hooker

13:14.200 --> 13:16.830
And her mom's an honorary
Kleagle in the Ku Klux Klan,

13:16.865 --> 13:19.230
but Chelsea is clean as a whistle.

13:19.265 --> 13:20.895
Kleagle?

13:20.930 --> 13:24.000
According to Wikipedia
it's below Grand Dragon

13:24.035 --> 13:27.060
And above Exalted Cyclops.

13:27.095 --> 13:28.765
Sure, whatever.

13:28.800 --> 13:32.200
What's the deal with
the lunch lady here?

13:36.800 --> 13:38.125
Alan?

13:38.160 --> 13:40.630
Well, that was Chelsea's idea, not mine.

13:40.665 --> 13:43.100
- I tried to get out of it.
- Really?

13:43.135 --> 13:44.595
I'm sorry, sweetie,

13:44.630 --> 13:47.100
But I thought a double date
with Charlie and his fiance

13:47.135 --> 13:49.160
Might be a little awkward.

13:49.195 --> 13:51.795
A little awkward?

13:51.830 --> 13:53.125
When I saw you sitting there,

13:53.160 --> 13:55.080
My sphincter slammed shut so quickly,

13:55.115 --> 13:57.000
You could've used it as a cigar cutter!

13:59.660 --> 14:02.400
Yeah, you should've seen your face.

14:03.400 --> 14:06.265
Anyway, it all worked out for the best.

14:06.300 --> 14:09.130
Last night, I saw a side of your brother

14:09.165 --> 14:11.030
That I've never seen before.

14:11.065 --> 14:12.525
What side?

14:12.560 --> 14:13.925
He's only got the two.

14:13.960 --> 14:16.360
"Oh, no, here he comes"
and "Oh good, he's leaving. "

14:18.030 --> 14:19.960
Look, Charlie, this has nothing to do

14:19.995 --> 14:21.065
With you and Chelsea.

14:21.100 --> 14:23.265
This has nothing to
do with you and Rose.

14:23.300 --> 14:25.830
The fact is, we really like each other

14:25.865 --> 14:28.712
Snd we want to keep seeing each other.

14:28.747 --> 14:31.523
And we'd really like your blessing.

14:31.558 --> 14:34.300
So, you actually want to be with him?

14:34.335 --> 14:35.695
I do.

14:35.730 --> 14:39.130
And you believe she's got no
ulterior motive whatsoever?

14:39.165 --> 14:41.747
I do.

14:41.782 --> 14:44.295
Fine.

14:44.330 --> 14:46.600
I now pronounce you
fruit basket and nutcase.

14:49.360 --> 14:52.200
May God have mercy on your souls.

14:52.235 --> 14:53.925
Yay!

14:53.960 --> 14:56.760
Uh, I don't think that was
really a blessing, Rose.

14:56.795 --> 14:58.265
It doesn't matter.

14:58.300 --> 15:00.130
So what are we doing this afternoon?

15:00.165 --> 15:01.925
Oh, uh, gee, I gotta pick up Jake.

15:01.960 --> 15:03.960
Um, I promised him I'd
take him to the movies.

15:03.995 --> 15:05.330
You know, a little father-son time.

15:05.365 --> 15:06.665
Oh, that's sweet.

15:06.700 --> 15:09.760
Well, just call me when you
want to get together again.

15:09.795 --> 15:11.500
Sure, or you can call me.

15:11.535 --> 15:13.200
Okay.

15:30.560 --> 15:31.265
Hello?

15:31.300 --> 15:35.160
Oh, Jake, thank God.

15:35.195 --> 15:37.195
Uh, nothing.

15:37.230 --> 15:39.330
Wait, hang on, I got another call.

15:39.365 --> 15:42.765
Hello?

15:42.800 --> 15:45.100
Yes, Rose, this is my number.

15:48.460 --> 15:50.095
So how did you like the movie?

15:50.130 --> 15:53.500
It was an insult to my intelligence.

15:53.535 --> 15:55.295
Really?

15:55.330 --> 15:58.500
Everybody knows zombies
can't ride motorcycles.

15:58.535 --> 16:00.365
Yeah, that bumped me, too.

16:00.400 --> 16:02.200
And why would they wear helmets?

16:02.235 --> 16:03.765
They're dead.

16:03.800 --> 16:04.865
Another good point.

16:04.900 --> 16:05.695
I don't know who they're

16:05.730 --> 16:08.745
making movies for these days.

16:08.780 --> 16:11.725
Fine, next time, you pick.

16:11.760 --> 16:14.700
Anyway, there's something
I want to talk to you about.

16:14.735 --> 16:17.530
Oh, come on, it was one
fart during the previews

16:17.565 --> 16:19.530
and everybody laughed.

16:19.565 --> 16:21.695
No, no, not that.

16:21.730 --> 16:23.265
Uh, I just want you to know

16:23.300 --> 16:24.830
that I've been dating somebody

16:24.865 --> 16:26.360
and you might be meeting her soon.

16:26.395 --> 16:28.065
Oh, okay, good.

16:28.100 --> 16:29.925
So, you have no problem with that?

16:29.960 --> 16:31.560
Not at all; you should
have a girlfriend.

16:31.595 --> 16:33.595
You think so?

16:33.630 --> 16:36.560
Yeah, the model car stuff
is starting to freak me out.

16:38.560 --> 16:40.245
I mean, seriously.

16:40.280 --> 16:41.930
You're a grown man.

16:43.900 --> 16:45.725
What the hell?

16:45.760 --> 16:48.860
You didn't call me!

16:49.700 --> 16:51.960
- Hi, Rose.
- Hi, Jack.

16:57.030 --> 16:59.230
So, tell me about your new girlfriend.

17:06.060 --> 17:09.760
I'm so glad you forgave me for
my little outburst in the car.

17:09.795 --> 17:13.597
Well, you have a very
compelling way of apologizing.

17:13.632 --> 17:17.400
But we need to have a
little talk about boundaries.

17:17.435 --> 17:21.329
It was just my pinky, Alan.

17:24.200 --> 17:26.359
No, no, that was fun.

17:27.760 --> 17:29.400
Is it about me following you and Jake

17:29.435 --> 17:31.095
into the movie theater?

17:31.130 --> 17:33.160
You followed us into the movie theater?!

17:33.195 --> 17:36.560
No...

17:37.400 --> 17:39.665
Look, Rose, I really like you

17:39.700 --> 17:41.730
but you've got to realize

17:41.765 --> 17:43.432
that people need their space.

17:43.467 --> 17:45.100
And you need to respect that.

17:45.135 --> 17:47.765
All right.

17:47.800 --> 17:50.460
So, we're clear on that?

17:50.495 --> 17:52.665
Yes. I'm sorry.

17:52.700 --> 17:54.060
It won't happen again.

17:54.095 --> 17:57.530
Hm. Good.

17:58.800 --> 18:00.130
Well, good night.

18:00.165 --> 18:02.660
Good night.

18:08.430 --> 18:11.530
Boy, this is an Alan Harper
I haven't seen before.

18:13.200 --> 18:16.700
Forceful, confident...

18:16.735 --> 18:18.225
Thank you.

18:18.260 --> 18:22.560
I don't like him very much.

18:32.360 --> 18:34.430
Morning, Charlie.

18:34.465 --> 18:36.465
Morning, Rose.

18:36.500 --> 18:37.865
Alan needs his space.

18:37.900 --> 18:39.195
I'm gonna give it to him.

18:39.230 --> 18:41.060
- Okay.
- Say hi to Chelsea for me.

18:41.095 --> 18:43.960
Will do.

18:48.230 --> 18:50.230
Oh, I got a bad feeling.

18:56.730 --> 18:58.395
Alan?

18:58.430 --> 19:00.580
Yeah?

19:00.615 --> 19:02.907
You okay?

19:02.942 --> 19:05.751
Been better.

19:05.786 --> 19:08.560
I'm coming in.

19:12.530 --> 19:14.795
- Hi.
- Hi

19:14.830 --> 19:17.060
Impressive.

19:17.900 --> 19:19.865
It's not me.

19:19.900 --> 19:21.550
No kidding.

19:21.585 --> 19:23.200
What is it?

19:38.360 --> 19:42.860
Oh, Burt Reynolds' Trans Am
from Smokey and the Bandit.

19:42.895 --> 19:46.365
Yep.

19:46.400 --> 19:49.430
Would you care to
explain why it's parked

19:49.465 --> 19:52.030
in your handicapped spot?

19:52.065 --> 19:54.100
Not parked.

19:54.135 --> 19:55.397
Glued.

19:55.432 --> 19:56.581
Ah.

19:56.616 --> 19:57.838
Rose?

19:57.873 --> 19:59.025
Rose.

19:59.060 --> 20:01.025
Told ya. You did.

20:01.060 --> 20:03.930
But did you listen? Nope.

20:03.965 --> 20:05.395
Okay.

20:05.430 --> 20:06.760
Happy motoring.

20:12.160 --> 20:16.730
* Here in my car, I feel safest of all *

20:19.830 --> 20:21.245
* Scooby Dooby Doo

20:21.280 --> 20:22.625
* Where are you?

20:22.660 --> 20:25.860
* We got some work to do now

20:25.895 --> 20:27.547
* Scooby Scooby Doo

20:27.582 --> 20:29.165
* Where are you?

20:29.200 --> 20:32.095
* We need some help from you now... *

20:32.130 --> 20:36.000
I feel bad it didn't work
out with Alan and Rose.

20:36.035 --> 20:37.917
Me, too.

20:37.952 --> 20:39.765
Terrible.

20:39.800 --> 20:42.700
The problem is they
jumped into bed too fast.

20:42.735 --> 20:45.600
The problem is he doesn't
keep his glue solvent

20:45.635 --> 20:47.682
in his night stand.

20:47.717 --> 20:49.695
What's that mean?

20:49.730 --> 20:53.000
Another way of saying what you said.

20:55.130 --> 20:56.330
Ow!

21:03.160 --> 21:05.330
What's wrong with him?

21:06.200 --> 21:09.660
Little car accident.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
