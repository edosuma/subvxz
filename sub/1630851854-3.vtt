WHILE THIS STORY IS BASED
ON ACTUAL EVENTS,

00:07.508 --> 00:10.970
CERTAIN CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS,
AND DIALOGUE WERE FICTIONALIZED.

00:11.053 --> 00:15.015
ANY SIMILARITY TO ANY PERSON,
LIVING OR DEAD, IS FOR DRAMATIC PURPOSES.

02:02.414 --> 02:04.583
MARADONA:
BLESSED DREAM

02:04.917 --> 02:06.252
MACHINE

02:13.717 --> 02:15.803
- Wait here, please.
- Hello.

02:15.886 --> 02:18.514
Will you let the doctor know
we've brought Coppola in?

02:19.431 --> 02:21.559
<i>So, what you're saying is,</i>

02:21.642 --> 02:25.271
<i>that at the time</i>
<i>of Mr. Maradona's decompensation,</i>

02:25.729 --> 02:28.190
only you and the owner of the house
were present,

02:28.274 --> 02:30.818
- and no one else.
- Exactly, Your Honor.

02:31.610 --> 02:35.072
Claudia Villafañe,
Mr. Maradona's wife, was not there.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.116
Well, yes, she was.

02:37.324 --> 02:40.369
She was asleep with the girls
in the main house.

02:41.745 --> 02:47.001
Because Diego and his wife are,
let's say, separated.

02:47.084 --> 02:49.712
Well, they're still together,
but separated.

02:50.170 --> 02:53.757
She was there
because they decided to spend

02:54.216 --> 02:55.718
the holidays as a family.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.221
Let's see, Mr. Coppola.

03:00.097 --> 03:02.182
A witness testified

03:03.058 --> 03:06.729
that there was a third person
in the guest house.

03:08.731 --> 03:13.110
<i>A male, between 45 and 50 years old,</i>

03:14.194 --> 03:19.325
<i>black hair, brown eyes, 5'6".</i>

03:19.408 --> 03:20.784
<i>A third person?</i>

03:21.160 --> 03:23.245
Sorry, Your Honor, with all due respect.

03:23.329 --> 03:27.041
I don't know who your witness is,

03:27.917 --> 03:33.005
but it sounds like they might've had
one too many on New Year's Eve.

03:33.297 --> 03:36.008
Something tells me
that if we look in the magazines

03:36.091 --> 03:38.552
for photos of Mr. Maradona's last stay,

03:38.636 --> 03:41.430
we'll find this third person.

03:41.805 --> 03:44.183
And that the witness will recognize him.

03:45.392 --> 03:46.810
Save me the paperwork.

03:50.439 --> 03:51.982
Carlos Ferro Viera.

03:54.318 --> 03:58.072
And why did you omit
his presence in your statement?

03:59.031 --> 04:01.283
<i>Because Ferro is a friend of Diego's</i>

04:01.367 --> 04:04.495
<i>who, let's say</i>
<i>he's not very well thought of,</i>

04:04.578 --> 04:06.580
<i>to avoid a media scandal.</i>

04:06.664 --> 04:08.165
WANTED
CARLOS FERRO VIERA

04:08.248 --> 04:10.501
<i>Sure. But this is the law.</i>

04:10.960 --> 04:14.630
<i>Where do Mr. Ferro Viera</i>
<i>and Mr. Maradona know each other from?</i>

04:14.713 --> 04:16.173
<i>I introduced them.</i>

04:16.256 --> 04:18.050
<i>I met Ferro when</i>

04:19.385 --> 04:22.304
I was arrested in my country.

04:22.638 --> 04:25.182
On a made-up, bogus charge.

04:25.265 --> 04:28.727
For the record,
I was declared completely innocent

04:28.811 --> 04:30.771
by justice system in my country.

04:31.480 --> 04:34.191
We could say that Mr. Ferro Viera is

04:34.274 --> 04:37.778
the one who provides cocaine
to your client here in Uruguay.

04:37.903 --> 04:39.279
I don't know.

04:39.655 --> 04:44.159
I thank God
I'm not at all involved with drugs

04:44.243 --> 04:49.373
and, as everyone knows,
Diego's in the process of recovery.

04:49.915 --> 04:52.459
Is Ferro Viera still here
in Punta del Este?

04:54.169 --> 04:56.463
I have no idea, Your Honor.

04:57.381 --> 05:00.009
I haven't been in the house
since Diego was hospitalized,

05:00.092 --> 05:04.304
not even to change my clothes.
I've been with Diego and his family.

05:04.388 --> 05:09.476
With all due respect, Your Honor,
I'd like to wrap this up.

05:10.019 --> 05:13.439
These are crucial moments and I need

05:14.481 --> 05:17.109
to be by my friend's side at the hospital.

05:21.572 --> 05:22.740
Next.

05:32.166 --> 05:35.044
DEPARTURE GATE

05:47.765 --> 05:50.559
I have a question.
I'm trying to figure out who this is.

05:51.185 --> 05:52.269
I can't place him.

05:52.352 --> 05:53.771
- Who is he?
- I don't know.

05:54.104 --> 05:56.106
- I have no idea.
- No?

05:56.190 --> 05:57.483
Do you know this guy?

05:58.776 --> 05:59.693
Yes.

05:59.777 --> 06:01.028
- You do?
- So do you.

06:01.737 --> 06:05.240
- No, I have no idea who this is.
- Yes, you do.

06:05.532 --> 06:08.660
Imagine him without glasses
and shorter hair.

06:09.787 --> 06:13.749
You almost have it.
Put some gray in his beard.

06:15.125 --> 06:16.043
Think.

06:16.752 --> 06:17.669
No!

06:18.420 --> 06:20.589
What an idiot! I couldn't saw it.

06:20.672 --> 06:22.466
You can tell it's Ricardo.

06:23.884 --> 06:26.345
You'll see a lot of photos
of them from that time.

06:26.428 --> 06:28.597
When Maradona played in Europe,

06:28.680 --> 06:30.349
Ricardo was his press officer.

06:30.432 --> 06:32.601
I didn't know they had a relationship.

06:32.684 --> 06:34.394
He was cold when he broke the news.

06:34.478 --> 06:36.605
They ended on really bad terms.

06:36.688 --> 06:38.607
Nobody knows what really happened,

06:38.690 --> 06:41.777
but as much as I love Diego,
I can tell you one thing.

06:41.860 --> 06:46.365
No friend, press agent, or manager
has lasted more than five years with him.

06:46.448 --> 06:49.535
Right. Well, thank you very much.

06:50.536 --> 06:51.870
- Can I have it?
- Okay.

06:51.954 --> 06:52.788
Thank you.

06:54.581 --> 06:57.793
RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL.

06:57.876 --> 06:59.586
I don't know any Maradona.

06:59.670 --> 07:01.505
Maradona doesn't exist here.

07:01.588 --> 07:03.882
Because you don't know
anything about soccer.

07:03.966 --> 07:07.594
We've won three World Cups.
And you? Just one.

07:07.678 --> 07:09.346
That was fixed by the military.

07:09.429 --> 07:11.348
Watch what you say, Brazilian.

07:11.849 --> 07:14.184
The 1978 champions are friends of mine.

07:14.643 --> 07:16.895
If you make me mad
and I'll get out of the cab.

07:16.979 --> 07:19.398
Get out here in the favela and shout,

07:19.815 --> 07:21.775
"Argentina is better than Brazil.

07:21.859 --> 07:24.278
Brazilians don't know
anything about soccer."

07:24.361 --> 07:27.906
They'll come down from the hill
and turn you into a girl.

07:27.990 --> 07:29.032
What did he say?

07:29.116 --> 07:31.076
If you get out here and shout

07:31.160 --> 07:34.079
that we're better than Brazil in a favela,

07:34.163 --> 07:36.206
they'll turn you into a girl.

07:36.290 --> 07:38.584
I take it back, I'm not getting out.

07:38.667 --> 07:41.837
We're here to do a special edition
for a sports magazine,

07:41.920 --> 07:44.506
because Diego's
the best player in Argentina.

07:44.590 --> 07:46.675
They say he'll be bigger than Pelé.

07:46.758 --> 07:47.843
Bigger than Pelé?

07:48.010 --> 07:50.345
So, Maradona is from another planet?

07:51.305 --> 07:52.222
Yes.

08:01.148 --> 08:02.274
How much is it?

08:02.357 --> 08:03.317
Twenty.

08:06.111 --> 08:07.321
Diego!

08:09.114 --> 08:10.240
Go.

08:11.783 --> 08:14.453
- An autograph?
- Yes, of course.

08:18.457 --> 08:21.210
Gentlemen, welcome. Please, come with me.

08:25.339 --> 08:27.216
Maybe he's taking a nap?

08:27.758 --> 08:29.968
Come, wait here quietly.

08:30.052 --> 08:32.012
- Please.
- Gentlemen.

08:33.889 --> 08:35.849
- Hello.
- What a pleasure.

08:35.933 --> 08:38.227
Thank you so much for having us.

08:38.310 --> 08:40.103
There's no need for introductions.

08:40.187 --> 08:41.647
Diego, how are you?

08:41.855 --> 08:43.273
Nice to meet you.

08:45.567 --> 08:47.361
What are you doing?

08:47.444 --> 08:50.072
Just making sure I'm not dreaming, sir.

08:50.614 --> 08:53.450
I've been following Diego
since he started,

08:53.533 --> 08:55.327
but I've never seen him this excited.

08:55.410 --> 08:57.996
Not even when he won
the Youth Championship.

08:58.914 --> 09:01.166
It's been two years since I retired.

09:01.250 --> 09:02.709
I miss the fans.

09:03.585 --> 09:08.674
The buzz and the smell of the grass.

09:08.757 --> 09:11.134
<i>I'm revealing who I am</i>

09:11.218 --> 09:15.097
<i>And I'm being who I can be</i>
<i>I throw myself into the world</i>

09:15.180 --> 09:17.557
<i>Walking everywhere</i>

09:17.641 --> 09:20.310
<i>And by the natural law of encounters</i>

09:20.394 --> 09:22.396
<i>I give and take a little bit more</i>

09:22.479 --> 09:25.065
<i>I use my eyes, naked or spectacled</i>

09:25.148 --> 09:26.692
<i>Past, present</i>

09:26.775 --> 09:29.820
<i>I participate by being</i>
<i>A mystery of this planet...</i>

09:30.696 --> 09:34.032
I like you very much, Dieguito. Look.

09:39.788 --> 09:41.039
Look, Dieguito.

09:41.123 --> 09:42.207
Hello.

09:54.845 --> 09:56.138
Sir.

09:59.224 --> 10:01.810
- May I ask for your autograph?
- Of course.

10:02.436 --> 10:03.812
<i>Take care of yourself</i>

10:03.895 --> 10:06.315
<i>and always stay away from bad company.</i>

10:06.606 --> 10:08.400
Healthy mind and body.

10:09.985 --> 10:11.361
Thank you, King.

10:11.445 --> 10:13.572
- Shall we take a picture?
- Sure.

10:16.742 --> 10:18.368
This manual is in Portuguese.

10:19.244 --> 10:20.829
What did you expect, Arabic?

10:20.912 --> 10:22.622
I bought it in Brazil, dummy.

10:22.706 --> 10:26.543
I heard you can't watch it for long,
because it ruins your sight.

10:26.626 --> 10:29.463
If we keep going like this,
we won't see any.

10:29.546 --> 10:31.715
Out the way. Leave it to me.

10:31.798 --> 10:34.593
- Thank God you play soccer.
- Go ahead.

10:34.676 --> 10:35.886
How does it look?

10:35.969 --> 10:38.180
They haven't installed the antenna yet.

10:38.263 --> 10:40.974
Tell me something nice
about your trip to Brazil.

10:41.058 --> 10:43.560
Besides Pelé, what else did you see?

10:43.643 --> 10:47.105
The beaches have white sand
and warm water.

10:47.606 --> 10:51.860
And the women all wear these tiny bikinis.

10:51.943 --> 10:53.779
Fat women cover themselves up here.

10:53.862 --> 10:57.199
But there, they're all half-naked,
showing their asses.

10:58.283 --> 10:59.409
All of them.

10:59.493 --> 11:01.244
Tall ones, thin ones,

11:01.328 --> 11:03.038
- short ones.
- Disgusting.

11:03.538 --> 11:07.167
- I said something nice, not that filth.
- I think it's nice.

11:07.292 --> 11:08.543
Is that so?

11:08.627 --> 11:13.048
You wouldn't mind me walking around
in nothing but a string?

11:15.342 --> 11:17.010
Are you crazy, Mom?

11:18.220 --> 11:20.263
Tell Morsa about where Pelé lives.

11:20.347 --> 11:22.015
He lives in a mansion.

11:22.099 --> 11:25.268
Yes, a huge house.
About 30 times bigger than this one.

11:25.435 --> 11:28.688
And there were girls
sunbathing in the pool.

11:29.022 --> 11:31.108
His girlfriend is a beautiful blonde.

11:31.191 --> 11:34.569
- A real blonde.
- So you prefer blondes over brunettes?

11:34.653 --> 11:37.739
No, are you crazy? No way.

11:37.948 --> 11:42.494
I like brunettes,
with straight hair and bangs.

11:42.702 --> 11:46.081
That's it. Okay, Chitoro.
Move the antenna.

11:47.082 --> 11:49.126
- There?
- Like that, Chitoro! That's it!

11:49.209 --> 11:50.794
Don't touch anything else.

11:55.465 --> 11:56.716
Dad!

11:57.092 --> 12:00.011
What? What are you looking at?
Look at the colors.

12:00.095 --> 12:02.347
Wait till they see you
in a Boca jersey, kid.

12:02.431 --> 12:04.307
- With the blue and gold.
- Okay.

12:31.668 --> 12:33.378
I'm throwing the ball to him.

12:35.464 --> 12:39.426
My boy'd never miss a chance

12:41.511 --> 12:43.180
to head the ball.

12:44.931 --> 12:47.350
You always call him that? "My boy"?

12:54.357 --> 12:56.735
And he's about to turn 40.

12:57.903 --> 12:59.362
But time...

13:01.239 --> 13:02.741
is different for him.

13:05.619 --> 13:07.913
Forty years of his life is...

13:09.706 --> 13:13.668
I don't know how many lives
for an ordinary person.

13:15.629 --> 13:18.548
The trips around the world
that my boy took.

13:19.841 --> 13:22.552
And so many trips inside his head.

13:23.053 --> 13:25.555
Because it's not easy to be in his shoes.

13:28.266 --> 13:29.643
He held on...

13:31.311 --> 13:32.729
and he held on.

13:34.856 --> 13:37.776
And I'm sure he'll keep holding on.

13:39.319 --> 13:42.697
My children, Lalo and Huguito,

13:43.031 --> 13:45.450
already knew that when they were little.

13:45.951 --> 13:47.077
It's on film.

13:48.495 --> 13:52.165
As Diego's brothers,
they were interviewed once.

13:52.999 --> 13:55.001
The reporter asked Huguito,

13:55.085 --> 13:58.088
"When you grow up, you'll be like Diego?"

13:59.589 --> 14:01.716
And he said, very innocently,

14:02.467 --> 14:04.970
"I don't think I'll ever be like him.

14:06.096 --> 14:08.306
Because my brother is a Martian.

14:09.224 --> 14:10.934
There's no question about it."

14:11.017 --> 14:12.310
And that statement...

14:15.313 --> 14:17.107
has always been true.

14:17.190 --> 14:21.319
As if Huguito had had a vision.

14:27.951 --> 14:31.621
Many have already
given my son up for dead.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.543
But I have faith in him.

14:39.671 --> 14:41.464
Because he's a Martian.

14:44.092 --> 14:45.844
There's no question about it.

14:49.055 --> 14:50.223
Excuse me.

15:04.863 --> 15:06.448
Wake up, son.

15:09.618 --> 15:11.953
You have a game today, did you forget?

15:16.374 --> 15:17.584
Son.

15:17.709 --> 15:21.171
- No, I need to sleep a little more.
- Good morning, handsome.

15:21.463 --> 15:22.797
Wake up.

15:25.675 --> 15:26.843
Hello, honey.

15:26.926 --> 15:29.012
- Hello.
- Claudia brought you the paper.

15:29.095 --> 15:31.431
You can read
what they say about the game.

15:32.140 --> 15:34.976
No kiss for mommy? Good morning.

15:37.145 --> 15:39.564
What does it say? Look.

15:41.024 --> 15:44.527
Gatti is so rude.
How can he say this?

15:44.611 --> 15:45.528
What did he do?

15:46.196 --> 15:48.156
He's just mean.

15:51.201 --> 15:52.452
Chubby?

15:54.245 --> 15:57.582
- He says I'm chubby.
- No, honey. You're not chubby.

15:58.208 --> 16:00.043
You need to eat.

16:00.418 --> 16:03.463
Daddy will be upset,
because he loves El Loco.

16:03.713 --> 16:05.340
What a fucking old asshole.

16:06.633 --> 16:07.717
Your daddy?

16:07.801 --> 16:09.886
No, Ma. Gatti.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.347
I don't get why he criticizes you.

16:12.430 --> 16:14.808
You were teammates on the national team.

16:14.933 --> 16:16.893
Who does he think he is?

16:18.061 --> 16:20.480
He never stops giving away stupid goals.

16:21.856 --> 16:23.775
You shouldn't have brought him this.

16:23.942 --> 16:26.945
Look at the bad mood
he's in now because of you.

16:27.195 --> 16:28.446
Let's go.

16:29.239 --> 16:31.408
Let him have his breakfast in peace.

16:31.950 --> 16:33.702
- Come on.
- Okay.

16:35.078 --> 16:37.497
I won't score just one goal
against this asshole.

16:37.580 --> 16:40.250
I'm gonna score four. Four.

16:44.504 --> 16:46.131
We'll see who's chubby.

16:48.925 --> 16:50.009
What did he say?

16:50.760 --> 16:52.303
He's gonna score four.

16:57.767 --> 16:59.769
Don't look at me like that.

16:59.853 --> 17:01.438
The press loves to stir things up.

17:01.521 --> 17:02.981
Why would I say that?

17:07.694 --> 17:09.112
I'll get four past you today.

17:09.988 --> 17:11.364
I promised my folks.

17:11.448 --> 17:14.451
Four against me, kid?
And they called me crazy.

17:14.534 --> 17:17.746
<i>A penalty for Argentinos Juniors,</i>
<i>there goes Diego, goal!</i>

17:18.121 --> 17:19.873
<i>Goal!</i>

17:19.956 --> 17:23.543
<i>Free kick for Argentinos Juniors,</i>
<i>Diego hit it... Super goal!</i>

17:23.626 --> 17:24.836
<i>Goal!</i>

17:25.128 --> 17:27.547
<i>Boca's ahead 3-2,</i>
<i>Argentinos looks to tie.</i>

17:27.630 --> 17:30.842
<i>Pasculi to Diego, goal!</i>

17:30.925 --> 17:35.513
<i>Don't tell me you're scoring again.</i>
<i>There goes Diego, goal!</i>

17:35.597 --> 17:40.059
<i>Goal!</i>

17:41.060 --> 17:42.604
Watch it, asshole.

17:42.687 --> 17:46.107
Lucky you.
If I'd been on a diet, I'd have scored 8.

17:46.399 --> 17:47.859
Diego, how are you?

17:47.942 --> 17:51.321
What can you say after this great victory
for Argentinos Juniors?

17:51.404 --> 17:53.448
<i>It was a good game,</i>

17:53.656 --> 17:57.744
<i>with lots of goals and I hope</i>
<i>that the Argentinos fans enjoyed it</i>

17:57.827 --> 17:59.287
<i>as much as the Boca fans.</i>

17:59.370 --> 18:02.123
<i>Hear that?</i>
<i>They're giving you a standing ovation.</i>

18:02.207 --> 18:04.751
<i>You don't hear that often</i>
<i>for a rival player.</i>

18:04.834 --> 18:05.877
<i>Diego! Diego!</i>

18:05.960 --> 18:09.589
<i>My dad's a Boca fan.</i>

18:10.048 --> 18:13.718
<i>And he must be sad</i>
<i>that they were eliminated,</i>

18:13.802 --> 18:15.887
<i>but this will make him feel better.</i>

18:15.970 --> 18:17.597
<i>-Thank you.</i>
<i>-Thank you, Diego.</i>

18:17.680 --> 18:19.641
<i>That was Diego Armando Maradona,</i>

18:19.724 --> 18:21.518
<i>captain of the Argentinos Juniors.</i>

18:21.768 --> 18:24.479
<i>-And for the first time in history...</i>
- There he is.

18:24.562 --> 18:25.772
<i>...a contract signing</i>

18:25.855 --> 18:28.608
<i>-is broadcast live on television.</i>
- So cute in his suit.

18:28.691 --> 18:31.820
<i>Apart from Maradona</i>
<i>and the other players involved,</i>

18:32.153 --> 18:36.449
<i>Jorge Cyterszpiler,</i>
<i>Diego's agent, is here,</i>

18:36.533 --> 18:39.494
<i>and Guillermo Coppola,</i>
<i>manager of the Boca players</i>

18:39.577 --> 18:42.664
<i>who will now go</i>
<i>to Argentinos Juniors as part of the deal.</i>

18:43.289 --> 18:45.375
<i>What would you like to say, Diego?</i>

18:45.458 --> 18:46.876
<i>I'm very happy.</i>

18:47.293 --> 18:50.839
<i>I'll be forever grateful</i>
<i>to the Argentinos fans</i>

18:50.922 --> 18:52.966
<i>and I'll carry them in my heart.</i>

18:53.383 --> 18:57.053
<i>And to the Boca fans,</i>
<i>especially to my old man,</i>

18:58.513 --> 19:00.348
<i>I hope I won't disappoint you.</i>

19:00.431 --> 19:03.726
- He mentioned me.
<i>-Bye, Argentinos. Hello, Boca.</i>

19:07.814 --> 19:09.482
He mentioned me.

19:13.361 --> 19:17.115
How does it feel to sign
a $4 million contract

19:17.198 --> 19:21.202
when the country's going through
an unprecedented economic crisis?

19:21.578 --> 19:25.748
I don't handle the numbers, guys.
Talk to Rengo about that.

19:26.541 --> 19:27.959
My business is soccer,

19:28.042 --> 19:31.629
and giving joy to the people
that really need it right now.

19:31.838 --> 19:34.883
When you're poor,
sometimes your only joy

19:34.966 --> 19:36.968
is when your team wins on Sunday.

19:37.760 --> 19:39.762
Don't forget that's where I come from.

19:39.846 --> 19:42.515
We used to have so many leaks
that it rained inside.

19:44.058 --> 19:48.730
To hire you, Boca traded six players,
who didn't want to leave, to Argentinos.

19:48.813 --> 19:52.400
Aren't you worried that the Boca team
will hold you responsible

19:52.483 --> 19:53.902
and might not welcome you?

19:53.985 --> 19:56.988
Look, I think

19:57.697 --> 19:59.699
that we're all professionals

20:00.116 --> 20:02.619
and the agreement is the clubs' business.

20:13.504 --> 20:15.965
The economic crisis is my fault now?

20:21.054 --> 20:22.805
No, what makes them angry...

20:24.724 --> 20:26.935
is that Maradona came out of poverty.

20:34.901 --> 20:37.528
I've needed to pee for two hours.

20:42.367 --> 20:43.952
Can you believe

20:44.744 --> 20:50.667
that when we were
about to sign the contract, Diego,

20:51.960 --> 20:54.295
I was holding my piss in so much...

20:55.964 --> 20:58.216
I thought I'd shit myself.

21:00.009 --> 21:03.846
Well, it makes sense, doesn't it?

21:04.931 --> 21:06.349
Down there,

21:07.225 --> 21:10.061
it's all connected.

21:11.729 --> 21:14.107
Journalists are real ball-busters, huh?

21:14.190 --> 21:16.693
They're always breaking your balls.

21:18.403 --> 21:21.114
What do they want? They never let up.

21:23.324 --> 21:26.661
But they're right
about one thing, aren't they?

21:31.499 --> 21:33.793
Your players didn't want to leave Boca.

21:35.128 --> 21:39.757
If the club had been interested
in keeping them,

21:40.883 --> 21:43.011
they wouldn't have traded them.

21:45.638 --> 21:48.933
In fact, it's an elegant way

21:50.977 --> 21:54.939
to get rid of them
but keep the boys working.

22:04.282 --> 22:06.325
Don't worry about it, Dieguito.

22:07.994 --> 22:09.412
You're...

22:11.748 --> 22:14.042
on top of the world.

22:15.418 --> 22:17.045
People see you

22:18.713 --> 22:22.550
as if you were just a goal machine.

22:24.427 --> 22:25.970
And they're not seeing...

22:28.890 --> 22:30.183
the boy.

22:37.732 --> 22:41.819
There's a party today
at a friend's nightclub.

22:42.403 --> 22:44.072
Why don't you come?

22:45.615 --> 22:48.367
Good vibes. Girls.

22:49.243 --> 22:52.121
One, four.

22:53.706 --> 22:57.293
You know, the girls often ask me,

22:58.544 --> 23:01.005
"When are you gonna bring Dieguito?"

23:02.465 --> 23:05.635
- Really? They do?
- Of course they do.

23:06.969 --> 23:09.305
So something's going to happen there.

23:18.064 --> 23:19.398
If you come,

23:23.277 --> 23:25.738
we'll celebrate, Dieguito.

23:29.200 --> 23:30.952
Let's celebrate the contract.

23:49.220 --> 23:52.098
Hello, darling. Hi, honey.

23:56.310 --> 24:00.189
- Guille!
- Darling.

24:00.481 --> 24:02.150
My love.

24:04.068 --> 24:05.945
You remember the girls?

24:06.028 --> 24:08.865
Look at the girls, how lovely.

24:13.744 --> 24:16.873
Dieguito! I'm so glad you came.

24:17.415 --> 24:19.041
This is great. I'm so glad.

24:19.125 --> 24:21.252
Jorgito, how are you?

24:21.335 --> 24:24.172
- Fine.
- Great to see you, boys.

24:24.255 --> 24:26.549
- Nice.
- Dieguito, my love!

24:26.632 --> 24:29.760
Monica has been dying to meet you.

24:29.844 --> 24:32.722
I'm a huge Boca Juniors fan.

24:33.097 --> 24:35.433
My two oldest sisters are fans of yours.

24:35.516 --> 24:38.561
Tell them to come to the theater,
I'll get them tickets.

24:38.644 --> 24:41.272
You don't know
what this woman is capable of.

24:41.564 --> 24:45.359
With the feathers in her costume,
she's a neutron bomb.

25:29.779 --> 25:31.113
<i>I thought you were blond.</i>

25:31.197 --> 25:33.074
<i>No, honey. I'm not blond.</i>

25:33.157 --> 25:35.701
<i>Did you think that I was a dumb blond?</i>

25:36.410 --> 25:38.829
<i>Honey, don't underestimate me.</i>

25:39.580 --> 25:41.624
<i>I can do so many things.</i>

25:53.636 --> 25:55.846
Tota, is everything okay?

25:56.138 --> 25:58.975
Pelusa didn't tell me
he was staying over, dear.

25:59.225 --> 26:01.644
You should tell him that he has a family.

26:02.353 --> 26:04.647
He needs to hurry or we'll miss practice.

26:04.814 --> 26:09.026
I'm sorry,
but my dad doesn't let him stay over.

26:09.819 --> 26:11.862
I thought he was home.

26:12.780 --> 26:16.534
- I don't know what to tell you.
- No.

26:17.702 --> 26:19.829
He stayed over at a teammate's then.

26:19.912 --> 26:23.541
I remember Chitoro said something,
but I was half asleep,

26:24.000 --> 26:25.626
so it didn't register.

26:25.960 --> 26:28.921
Well, excuse me, dear.
Tell your family I said hi.

26:29.046 --> 26:30.798
Thanks, have a good day.

26:37.722 --> 26:39.098
No kiss for Daddy?

26:47.648 --> 26:49.108
Good morning, darling.

26:54.322 --> 26:56.324
Don't look like that.

26:57.033 --> 26:59.368
He probably stayed at a friend's house.

26:59.452 --> 27:01.454
Maybe they went out for a drink.

27:01.579 --> 27:05.374
It's better that he stays there
and doesn't drive home like that.

27:06.500 --> 27:09.670
He was going to bed early
because he had practice.

27:09.754 --> 27:11.881
Maybe the boy needed to relax.

27:12.506 --> 27:15.384
All these commitments must stifle him.

27:15.760 --> 27:18.637
As his partner,
you should be understanding.

27:19.180 --> 27:22.099
Over time,
you'll get used to what men are like.

27:22.183 --> 27:23.726
You give me such hope, Dad.

27:23.809 --> 27:25.644
You come from a good family.

27:25.728 --> 27:28.022
You don't give yourself away easily.

27:28.564 --> 27:32.526
If he disappears from time to time
for a couple of hours,

27:32.610 --> 27:34.320
it's his right.

27:36.405 --> 27:38.824
Men have different needs than women.

27:39.533 --> 27:40.701
We need to unload.

27:40.785 --> 27:42.912
- Coco.
- Well, we get pain in the...

27:42.995 --> 27:46.165
Dad, you're disgusting!
Mom, are you listening to him?

27:46.248 --> 27:49.043
- I'm used to it.
- You know what I'm talking about.

27:49.668 --> 27:51.796
She knows me, that's why I love her.

27:51.879 --> 27:54.757
Look, if she wasn't mine already,
I'd buy her.

27:58.469 --> 27:59.303
Hey!

28:01.055 --> 28:02.932
What do you think you're doing?

28:03.474 --> 28:05.267
Did you forget we have guests?

28:06.394 --> 28:07.228
Go outside.

28:12.149 --> 28:13.067
You stay there.

28:19.532 --> 28:22.451
Nobody teach you
how to behave like a lady?

28:46.434 --> 28:47.685
Okay. Thank you.

28:51.272 --> 28:52.773
We can do it some other day.

28:52.857 --> 28:54.608
When Giménez finishes, we'll go.

28:54.692 --> 28:56.444
Cheer up, it's great!

28:56.527 --> 28:57.736
It's your birthday!

28:59.196 --> 29:02.199
I'm not scared.
But if my folks find out...

29:02.825 --> 29:04.702
Your folks already know we're here.

29:08.789 --> 29:09.748
Who's next?

29:10.583 --> 29:13.002
I was told it's the birthday boy's turn.

29:13.878 --> 29:15.212
Will you come with me?

29:27.099 --> 29:28.476
Happy Birthday!

29:39.028 --> 29:41.280
Pelusa isn't here. He's out.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.365
I wanted to give him a gift.

29:43.449 --> 29:46.744
When he gets back, he'll go to bed
because he has practice.

29:48.454 --> 29:49.705
I'll give it to him.

29:52.458 --> 29:55.503
Listen, forget about Pelusa, okay?

29:56.545 --> 29:58.380
He has to focus on soccer.

29:58.464 --> 30:00.090
Diego says he likes being with me.

30:00.174 --> 30:02.885
What I say matters, not Diego's words.

30:12.937 --> 30:14.813
Are you sure about this, Diego?

30:15.689 --> 30:17.608
Your debut can wait a week.

30:17.691 --> 30:20.069
No, Silvio, what are you talking about?

30:20.236 --> 30:21.403
Listen to that.

30:22.530 --> 30:23.948
The place is packed.

30:24.031 --> 30:25.407
They'll understand.

30:26.408 --> 30:28.202
They know you're injured.

30:28.285 --> 30:30.746
No, don't worry.

30:31.539 --> 30:35.084
I've been getting injections
since I was 10 years old.

30:44.134 --> 30:45.302
Go ahead, Doc.

30:56.272 --> 30:57.523
Hey, Doc.

31:00.234 --> 31:01.610
You know them well.

31:05.239 --> 31:08.951
Are these guys always such assholes

31:09.034 --> 31:11.203
with newcomers, or just with me?

31:11.287 --> 31:14.164
They blame me for the trade, don't they?

31:14.248 --> 31:16.792
Don't worry, they'll forget soon enough.

31:56.206 --> 32:00.961
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>the moment we've been waiting for.</i>

32:01.086 --> 32:03.047
<i>Maradona's here.</i>

32:03.130 --> 32:05.382
<i>Boca's here.</i>

32:05.466 --> 32:09.678
<i>Diego Armando Maradona is here.</i>

32:13.724 --> 32:16.185
<i>Number 10 is making his debut today,</i>

32:16.268 --> 32:18.103
<i>wearing the Boca jersey.</i>

32:18.187 --> 32:20.731
<i>-His family is happy.</i>
<i>-</i> I love you, Diego!

32:20.814 --> 32:22.483
<i>His parents are full of joy.</i>

32:24.860 --> 32:26.987
<i>The Bombonera has been</i>
<i>waiting for this.</i>

32:27.071 --> 32:30.115
<i>It's Boca versus Talleres de Córdoba.</i>

32:33.243 --> 32:35.079
<i>There goes Maradona.</i>

32:35.579 --> 32:40.834
<i>A penalty. Maradona shoots! Goal!</i>

32:41.251 --> 32:46.882
<i>Goal by Boca!</i>

32:46.965 --> 32:49.510
<i>Diego scores. Maradona scores.</i>

32:49.593 --> 32:52.805
<i>For Diego's debut,</i>
<i>it's Boca, four, Talleres, one.</i>

32:52.888 --> 32:55.641
<i>Are you awake</i>
<i>or did you fall asleep, honey?</i>

32:55.724 --> 32:59.478
No, Moni, how could I fall asleep?
I'm here.

33:42.980 --> 33:46.442
You know what my present will be
for the goals you scored?

33:46.525 --> 33:48.610
All this for two penalties?

33:50.070 --> 33:52.322
And when I win the World Cup?

33:57.286 --> 33:58.746
This is insane.

34:07.087 --> 34:08.922
This is ridiculous.

34:09.006 --> 34:12.342
I promise you
that this will be a media scandal!

34:12.426 --> 34:15.345
What am I saying, media scandal?
A diplomatic one!

34:16.263 --> 34:18.807
Do you understand
that I'm a public figure?

34:20.058 --> 34:21.977
Look at me!

34:22.144 --> 34:26.023
Diego Armando Maradona,
you son of a bitch.

34:27.024 --> 34:30.152
Let's go, let's go up the Celeste.

34:34.490 --> 34:39.203
<i>This is a video for Dalma and Giannina</i>
<i>from Diego Armando Maradona,</i>

34:39.828 --> 34:41.205
<i>but watch out,</i>

34:43.081 --> 34:46.001
<i>don't let Mom know,</i>
<i>because it's a surprise.</i>

34:46.168 --> 34:49.379
<i>-Good morning.</i>
<i>-Get out.</i>

34:49.463 --> 34:52.925
<i>Come on, wake up!</i>
<i>I have a surprise for you.</i>

34:53.008 --> 34:55.636
<i>Do you want to know what it is? Come here.</i>

34:57.930 --> 34:59.431
<i>There it is!</i>

35:00.307 --> 35:02.518
<i>-A pony!</i>
<i>-Do you like it?</i>

35:02.601 --> 35:04.394
<i>Dad, you're the...</i>

35:04.645 --> 35:08.148
- Girls, I brought you something to eat.
- Okay.

35:08.565 --> 35:12.986
And we set up the mirror,
and we put makeup on her.

35:13.070 --> 35:14.321
What are you doing?

35:22.246 --> 35:27.000
- Mommy!
- What are the police doing?

35:27.084 --> 35:28.544
What do you mean?

35:32.214 --> 35:35.050
Fucking pigs, you're wrecking the house!

35:35.133 --> 35:37.970
If you touch that million-dollar vase,
I'll kill you.

35:38.095 --> 35:39.972
- I swear I'll...
- Hello.

35:41.265 --> 35:43.559
- Are you in charge of the raid?
- Yes.

35:43.642 --> 35:45.394
Claudia Villafañe Maradona.

35:45.477 --> 35:49.523
I'm here for my daughters.
They're minors, they shouldn't see this.

35:49.898 --> 35:52.860
- No one can leave the house, ma'am.
- My daughters can.

35:52.943 --> 35:54.653
- Ma'am.
- I'm getting my daughters.

35:54.736 --> 35:56.989
- They are minors. Pablo, where are they?
- Sorry.

35:57.072 --> 35:59.116
I'm getting them. Where are the girls?

35:59.199 --> 36:00.993
- They're fine.
- Send them down.

36:05.539 --> 36:07.124
We have to go downstairs.

36:09.459 --> 36:12.588
Shall we? That's it.

36:17.718 --> 36:19.052
Mommy!

36:19.761 --> 36:21.763
- Are you okay?
- Grandma!

36:27.185 --> 36:28.687
Don't lie to us.

36:29.187 --> 36:32.357
- Dad's dead?
- For God's sake, don't say that.

36:32.441 --> 36:35.110
I'm sick of being treated
like everyone else!

36:35.485 --> 36:36.904
I know Dad's dead.

36:37.195 --> 36:40.574
- That's why the police is here.
- No, that's not true.

36:40.657 --> 36:42.034
It's something else.

36:42.868 --> 36:46.747
I'd never hide something
like that from you.

36:47.122 --> 36:49.249
Dad is not dead, Dad is alive.

36:50.125 --> 36:52.794
He's in bad shape, but he'll recover

36:52.878 --> 36:56.006
because he's a strong man, you know?

36:56.089 --> 36:58.050
A lot of people are helping him,

36:58.467 --> 36:59.968
so he'll be fine.

37:01.094 --> 37:04.681
- Stay calm, okay?
- Okay.

37:14.066 --> 37:15.359
How are you?

37:15.442 --> 37:16.777
How are you, guys?

37:20.864 --> 37:23.784
Just came by to say hi.

37:23.867 --> 37:26.536
And to encourage you
for tomorrow's game!

37:29.289 --> 37:31.792
You have to beat River.
There's no other way.

37:31.875 --> 37:34.044
We all agree on that, don't we?

37:35.879 --> 37:37.881
What's your problem with Maradona?

37:38.215 --> 37:40.717
The kid runs around the entire game,

37:40.801 --> 37:42.928
and you don't give him the ball!

37:43.011 --> 37:45.555
- What the fuck did we buy him for?
- Calm down.

37:45.681 --> 37:48.016
What happens on the field is our business.

37:48.100 --> 37:49.142
Cut the crap, José.

37:49.559 --> 37:51.311
You can't storm in like this.

37:51.395 --> 37:55.482
Boca is my home
so I'll come and go as I please.

37:57.401 --> 37:58.610
Don't worry.

37:58.694 --> 38:01.071
We didn't come here
to tell you how to play.

38:01.154 --> 38:05.826
We're here because some of you
are playing the fool

38:06.284 --> 38:09.413
- about paying the fee.
- What fee are you talking about?

38:11.748 --> 38:15.252
See why Perotti is an idiot on the field?

38:15.335 --> 38:17.838
Because he's an idiot off the field too!

38:19.214 --> 38:20.757
Perotti.

38:20.841 --> 38:25.137
You want money.
I'm not going to give you a penny.

38:27.347 --> 38:30.225
- Does anyone else have a problem?
- I do!

38:32.769 --> 38:34.521
Who do you think you are?

38:37.774 --> 38:39.234
Huh?

38:41.403 --> 38:42.988
What about you?

38:44.614 --> 38:46.450
You say you're Boca fans

38:47.743 --> 38:51.329
and you come and threaten us
12 hours before a derby?

38:53.373 --> 38:55.584
Anyone can be tough holding an iron bar.

38:55.667 --> 38:57.586
This has nothing to do with you.

38:58.462 --> 38:59.755
You're wrong.

39:01.673 --> 39:04.051
If you mess with my teammates,
you mess with me.

39:04.760 --> 39:05.927
Got it?

39:07.429 --> 39:10.223
You're standing up for these shits,

39:10.390 --> 39:12.726
who've been terrible teammates to you?

39:26.490 --> 39:30.285
You get a pass,
because I like people with balls.

39:32.579 --> 39:35.207
- You're wrong, Diego.
- Bunch of wusses.

39:35.290 --> 39:37.292
Buddy, you don't come from Boca.

39:37.375 --> 39:39.628
Come on, Boca. We must win!

39:39.711 --> 39:42.172
La Plata derby is coming up.

39:42.297 --> 39:44.508
We'll see about that later.

39:46.426 --> 39:48.804
<i>It's a party here at La Bombonera.</i>

39:48.887 --> 39:50.931
Boca's beating its rival, River, 2-0.

39:51.014 --> 39:52.349
Diego wants a goal.

39:52.432 --> 39:55.102
<i>Here goes Córdoba, pulling out the center.</i>

39:55.185 --> 39:57.854
<i>Diego drops it.</i>
<i>Pato Fillol leaves him scrambling.</i>

39:57.938 --> 40:01.233
<i>He hits it! Goal!</i>

40:01.316 --> 40:04.486
<i>Goal for Boca!</i>

40:04.569 --> 40:07.114
<i>Wonderful. Classic move from Diego.</i>

40:07.197 --> 40:08.949
<i>Boca, 3, River, 0.</i>

40:10.033 --> 40:11.451
<i>It's his first year in Boca.</i>

40:11.535 --> 40:15.539
<i>Diego Armando Maradona's</i>
<i>on the front page of every newspaper.</i>

40:15.622 --> 40:17.916
<i>Not just in Argentina,</i>
<i>but the entire world.</i>

40:17.999 --> 40:19.918
<i>Everyone praises Diego.</i>

40:20.001 --> 40:21.378
<i>Boca's the champion.</i>

40:21.461 --> 40:25.715
<i>Boca team, lead by Silvio Marzolini,</i>
<i>has great stars.</i>

40:25.799 --> 40:29.010
<i>And this was key in decisive games.</i>

40:30.804 --> 40:34.266
<i>Against Ferro, they won 1-0</i>
<i>with a goal by Perotti.</i>

40:39.646 --> 40:40.689
<i>There goes Diego.</i>

40:40.772 --> 40:45.944
<i>There goes Maradona, goal for Boca!</i>

40:46.361 --> 40:48.113
<i>Diego Armando Maradona.</i>

40:48.196 --> 40:50.991
Great expectations,
Boca's going for the championship.

40:51.074 --> 40:54.202
<i>Penalty for Boca. He moves, he shoots...</i>

40:54.286 --> 40:59.374
<i>Goal for Boca!</i>

40:59.457 --> 41:02.502
<i>La Bombonera is about to explode.</i>
<i>Boca wins!</i>

41:02.586 --> 41:04.421
<i>They win the 1981 championship.</i>

41:06.256 --> 41:08.425
Come on! We are the champions!

41:11.553 --> 41:14.973
<i>Go, champion!</i>

41:15.891 --> 41:20.645
<i>Go, champion!</i>

41:20.729 --> 41:24.983
BOCA CHAMPIONS!
DIEGO IS THE UNDISPUTED STAR

42:24.251 --> 42:28.505
HAS DIEGO MARADONA
FORGOTTEN WHERE HE CAME FROM?

42:29.047 --> 42:31.883
If it happens again,
we'll run some tests, okay?

42:31.967 --> 42:35.220
But it doesn't look serious,
just a drop in pressure.

42:40.433 --> 42:42.018
Don't get upset, Tota.

42:42.435 --> 42:44.104
People talk out of jealousy.

42:46.398 --> 42:47.607
Thank you.

42:48.984 --> 42:50.527
You heard him, Mommy.

42:51.236 --> 42:52.904
You need to stop worrying.

42:53.071 --> 42:55.240
- You need to relax.
- Yes, son.

42:58.952 --> 43:02.664
"It's 55 feet wide and 160 deep,

43:02.747 --> 43:06.084
has a garden and a swimming pool,
four en-suite bedrooms

43:06.584 --> 43:08.586
and a garage for three vehicles,

43:08.670 --> 43:11.172
where Diego keeps his two Mercedes Benzes

43:11.298 --> 43:14.217
and a Fiat 125, his first car,

43:14.342 --> 43:17.053
which he keeps
even though he no longer uses it."

43:17.137 --> 43:19.097
They forgot about the sauna

43:19.180 --> 43:20.932
and the size of the living room.

43:21.057 --> 43:23.601
Listen. "Now in their mansion,

43:23.935 --> 43:26.938
the Maradona family
from Villa Fiorito is gone.

43:27.439 --> 43:29.149
In their old neighborhood,

43:29.274 --> 43:33.153
the neighbors say
that Doña Tota only remembers them

43:33.236 --> 43:35.071
when she's looking for a maid."

43:35.155 --> 43:36.531
It makes me so mad.

43:38.074 --> 43:40.410
Mom shouldn't suffer
because of these assholes.

43:40.493 --> 43:42.954
Honey, don't listen to the press.

43:43.955 --> 43:45.290
People love you.

43:45.957 --> 43:49.294
Look at all the letters you receive.

43:50.378 --> 43:51.463
What's this?

43:51.963 --> 43:53.465
I order them by topic.

43:55.133 --> 43:57.552
These are from people who need some help.

43:58.219 --> 43:59.512
I answer them sooner.

44:02.474 --> 44:03.683
An apartment?

44:05.018 --> 44:07.520
He is asking me
to give him an apartment?

44:07.604 --> 44:11.733
Sure, apartments, houses,
medicine, clothes.

44:11.816 --> 44:14.611
What the hell is wrong with them?
They're crazy!

44:18.823 --> 44:20.450
Calm down, honey.

44:21.076 --> 44:23.411
What the press says doesn't matter.

44:24.454 --> 44:25.372
It doesn't matter.

44:32.587 --> 44:34.547
There it is.

44:35.423 --> 44:36.883
I've got it.

44:37.384 --> 44:41.054
Come on. Here, hold it. Firmly.

44:42.680 --> 44:43.932
With both hands.

44:44.766 --> 44:46.226
Patience.

44:46.309 --> 44:49.979
You need patience to reel it in.
That's how you lose a dorado.

44:50.522 --> 44:53.400
Higher up, here. Hold it.

45:15.547 --> 45:17.632
I'm sure they're bitching about me.

45:19.342 --> 45:20.802
Especially Menotti.

45:22.137 --> 45:25.557
Why didn't you talk to him?
He could give you some good advice.

45:31.062 --> 45:33.857
Sometimes I want to disappear
off the face of the earth.

45:36.734 --> 45:39.028
I don't know what people want from me.

45:41.489 --> 45:44.409
It's like I have to apologize
for everything I have.

45:45.368 --> 45:47.662
You've sacrificed a lot.

45:47.745 --> 45:49.956
- When we were...
- Hello.

45:51.958 --> 45:54.169
What the fuck are you doing here, Ricardo?

45:54.252 --> 45:57.922
Sorry, Diego.
I know I'm interrupting your vacation,

45:58.006 --> 45:59.507
but people are getting crazy.

45:59.591 --> 46:02.969
They want to know if you're retiring,
what you're up to.

46:03.052 --> 46:04.971
You're out of your mind.

46:05.430 --> 46:07.390
Come on, let's talk for a minute.

46:07.474 --> 46:09.476
- No way.
- I brought you the paper.

46:09.934 --> 46:11.895
They all mention you, look.

46:12.604 --> 46:14.481
- How's it going, Chitoro?
- Careful.

46:15.148 --> 46:16.316
Oh, shit.

46:18.234 --> 46:20.445
Sorry. Look.

46:22.530 --> 46:24.199
Don't get mad.

46:27.076 --> 46:28.369
You're crazy.

46:28.745 --> 46:30.997
You know how hard it was
for me to come?

46:31.372 --> 46:33.416
"Come back, Maradona, we forgive you."

46:34.375 --> 46:35.710
Forgive me for what?

46:39.797 --> 46:45.011
I came here,
where my dad was born, to rest.

46:45.678 --> 46:48.973
It's good that you're getting
some fresh air,

46:49.641 --> 46:51.559
but the fans love you, Diego.

46:51.809 --> 46:53.937
The World Cup's coming up.
They want you there.

46:54.020 --> 46:57.607
They need to understand
that Maradona's not a happiness machine.

47:00.485 --> 47:02.403
I'm just a person.

47:02.487 --> 47:04.906
So now I'll go back to Buenos Aires,

47:04.989 --> 47:08.326
I'll publish that I discovered
your secret place.

47:08.993 --> 47:12.789
And what else do I say?
Give me a scoop, Diego, come on.

47:13.122 --> 47:15.416
I'm tired of people saying
fake things about me.

47:15.542 --> 47:19.170
"Maradona will return to train
for the World Cup in a few days."

47:20.338 --> 47:22.173
I don't know what to tell you.

47:28.429 --> 47:30.932
What are you gonna do?
Hunt and fish?

47:31.724 --> 47:33.726
Give tours on your boat?

47:33.851 --> 47:36.187
- I'll publish that.
- You're clever.

47:36.354 --> 47:40.066
Maybe I could be a singer.
What's so funny?

47:40.149 --> 47:41.901
<i>I loved her, boys</i>

47:42.527 --> 47:43.987
<i>And I love her</i>

47:44.112 --> 47:46.698
<i>And I'll never forget her</i>

47:47.448 --> 47:48.700
I get it.

47:48.783 --> 47:51.452
<i>I get drunk because of her</i>

47:52.120 --> 47:54.872
<i>And who knows what she will do?</i>

47:55.999 --> 47:58.334
You're great... at playing soccer.

47:59.711 --> 48:02.505
- A singer, go figure.
- What are you laughing at?

48:11.598 --> 48:13.516
Where is Maradona?

48:13.600 --> 48:16.060
Has he gone back to his family?

48:16.144 --> 48:18.646
Who will you choose if he won't play?

48:20.315 --> 48:22.400
César, do you know where he is?

48:22.483 --> 48:25.069
Do you have a plan B
if Maradona doesn't come back?

48:31.618 --> 48:33.911
Menotti, what do you know about Diego?

48:34.370 --> 48:36.497
The mystery continues,
where is Maradona?

48:36.581 --> 48:38.458
If I knew, I wouldn't buy this.

48:38.541 --> 48:41.169
Will you play the World Cup
without Maradona?

48:47.550 --> 48:49.260
GOOD NEWS,
WE GOT THE FALKLANDS BACK!

48:49.344 --> 48:52.639
<i>As president of the nation,</i>

48:53.806 --> 48:56.851
<i>I ask the English people</i>
<i>and its government</i>

BRITISH HUMILIATED BY THE INVASION

49:08.404 --> 49:10.281
<i>The Argentine government</i>

49:10.365 --> 49:14.327
<i>and its people are</i>
<i>once again becoming enraged</i>

49:14.535 --> 49:19.999
<i>and reporting the greatest offenses.</i>

49:20.375 --> 49:22.710
<i>If they want to come, let them come.</i>

49:22.794 --> 49:24.754
<i>We will bring the battle to them.</i>

That way, come on.

50:10.633 --> 50:11.843
Guys!

50:16.305 --> 50:18.599
Diego, the president wants to talk to you.

50:31.487 --> 50:33.740
I ask two things of you,

50:34.449 --> 50:39.912
persistence of effort
and a spirit of sacrifice.

50:40.621 --> 50:43.833
In the Falklands, we are winning a war,

50:44.500 --> 50:48.504
but we also have to win
on another battlefield,

50:49.130 --> 50:55.011
so that the world can see
that Argentina is a world power.

50:55.470 --> 50:59.515
You are going to be our soldiers in Spain,

50:59.599 --> 51:04.270
to bring joy
to all the Argentinean people.

51:14.280 --> 51:16.699
<i>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.</i>

51:16.783 --> 51:20.661
<i>Twenty-four hours</i>

51:20.745 --> 51:22.914
<i>for the Argentine Falklands begins now.</i>

51:23.039 --> 51:25.500
<i>Diego, thank you very much for being here.</i>

51:25.583 --> 51:28.169
<i>Daniel, thank you very much</i>
<i>for being here.</i>

<i>The national team will donate</i>
<i>100 million pesos.</i>

51:36.886 --> 51:41.641
<i>Having watched</i>
<i>this very moving show yesterday,</i>

51:41.724 --> 51:44.852
<i>I believe that</i>
<i>if we were asked to give our lives,</i>

51:44.936 --> 51:46.729
<i>we would certainly do it.</i>

52:03.162 --> 52:05.832
- Diego! Maradona!
- Maradona, give us a second.

52:05.915 --> 52:07.500
- Diego!
- Diego!

52:13.464 --> 52:15.758
- Diego!
- Maradona!

52:17.343 --> 52:20.054
- Maradona!
- Diego!

52:20.179 --> 52:23.266
- Diego.
- Maradona, one second, please.

52:23.349 --> 52:26.352
Any thoughts about
human rights violations in Argentina?

52:26.435 --> 52:29.647
Do you know that there are thousands
of people who have disappeared?

52:29.730 --> 52:32.692
Argentine soldiers are being massacred
in the war.

52:32.775 --> 52:35.862
Can you play the World Cup
while that's happening, Diego?

52:35.945 --> 52:38.781
It's said that the donations
have never reached the Falklands.

52:38.865 --> 52:41.242
- What do you know about it?
- Diego!

54:38.776 --> 54:41.404

54:41.487 --> 54:45.366

<i>to make the difference.</i>

1982 World Cup: Argentina showed promise
with a champion team,

54:53.457 --> 54:56.961
but won two games and lost three,
saying goodbye in the second phase

54:57.044 --> 54:59.630
with Maradona sent off for a serious foul.

55:01.799 --> 55:04.427
Donations collected during
<i>"24 hours for the Falklands" </i>

55:04.510 --> 55:06.679
never reached their destination.

55:06.846 --> 55:11.434
Many soldiers were sent to war without
training and weapons that didn't work.

55:13.477 --> 55:16.772
After losing the match to Belgium,
Argentina surrendered to the English.

55:16.856 --> 55:19.859
The war left more than
1200 Argentine soldiers wounded

55:19.942 --> 55:21.652
and 649 killed in combat.

55:23.404 --> 55:26.615
A similar number of veterans
committed suicide after the conflict.

55:26.699 --> 55:29.827
The surrender precipitated
the fall of the Military Dictatorship

55:29.910 --> 55:31.662
and the return to democracy.

55:45.634 --> 55:50.473
<i>On behalf of Diego Armando Maradona,</i>
<i>I give you this check.</i>

55:50.556 --> 55:53.851

<i>for the "Argentine Falklands"</i>
<i>patriotic fund</i>

55:56.729 --> 55:58.773
<i>signed by Diego Armando Maradona.</i>

56:30.387 --> 56:34.934
<i>It's really difficult</i>
<i>to leave Argentinos Junior</i>

56:35.017 --> 56:38.562
<i>because I keep it in my heart.</i>
<i>It's part of my life.</i>

57:31.115 --> 57:34.160
<i>You travel to Spain on July 23rd?</i>

57:34.243 --> 57:37.246
<i>Yes, I signed the contract for that date.</i>

57:37.329 --> 57:39.665
<i>-Thank you, Diego, good luck.</i>
<i>-Thank you.</i>
