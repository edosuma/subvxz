WEBVTT

00:00.466 --> 00:03.134
- Oh, my God.
- This is insane.

00:05.638 --> 00:07.038
[Screams]

00:07.073 --> 00:09.908
This season,
<i>Face Off</i> has a whole new twist.

00:09.942 --> 00:13.311
Three champions have returned to
coach their own team of artists.

00:13.345 --> 00:15.246
- So let's get moving.
- It's insane.

00:15.281 --> 00:18.783
They'll steer their new
proteges toward the finale.

00:18.818 --> 00:21.586
Things are about to get real.

00:21.620 --> 00:23.922
But with a season
full of demanding challenges...

00:23.956 --> 00:27.592
I have a big announcement
to make.

00:27.626 --> 00:28.927
I am freaking out.

00:28.961 --> 00:31.196
It is complete pandemonium.

00:31.230 --> 00:33.465
And a judging panel
filled with the industry's

00:33.499 --> 00:35.667
- brightest stars...
- I think it's so cool.

00:35.701 --> 00:39.771
Coming out on top will be
tougher than ever before.

00:39.805 --> 00:41.473
What the heck
is happening right now?

00:41.507 --> 00:43.942
This competition is nuts.

00:43.976 --> 00:45.343
In the end, only one

00:45.377 --> 00:47.979
will win a VIP trip from
Kryolan Professional Make-Up

00:48.013 --> 00:51.015
to one of their 85
international locations,

00:51.050 --> 00:53.918
a brand-new 2014 Fiat 500,

00:53.953 --> 00:56.688
and $100,000.

00:56.722 --> 01:00.091
Find out
how it all begins right now.

01:00.126 --> 01:02.160
This is <i> Face Off.</i>

01:05.131 --> 01:08.399

01:45.871 --> 01:48.172
We're in the middle
of downtown LA,

01:48.207 --> 01:51.275
and we have no idea
what to expect.

01:51.310 --> 01:52.877
All of a sudden
these doors open.

01:52.911 --> 01:55.079
Oh, my God.

01:55.114 --> 01:56.114
Wow.

01:56.148 --> 01:58.950
This room is huge.

01:58.984 --> 02:00.485
- Ah, man.
- This is insane.

02:00.519 --> 02:01.919
I can't believe this.

02:01.954 --> 02:04.989
There's supplies everywhere,
paint, airbrushes,

02:05.023 --> 02:06.924
and Kryolan makeup.
It's crazy.

02:06.959 --> 02:08.493
So much stuff to choose from.

02:08.526 --> 02:10.761
I can't wait to get started.

02:10.795 --> 02:11.896
Hello, everybody.

02:11.930 --> 02:13.498
Welcome to <i> Face Off.</i>

02:13.532 --> 02:17.101
[Cheers and applause]

02:17.136 --> 02:19.003
I look up,
and I see McKenzie Westmore

02:19.037 --> 02:20.271
walking down the stairs,

02:20.305 --> 02:23.975
and I'm like,
"Oh, my God. This is it."

02:26.612 --> 02:27.612
Hey, guys.

02:27.646 --> 02:29.147
All: Hi.

02:29.181 --> 02:33.562
This season of <i>Face Off</i> is
going to be unlike any before,

02:33.597 --> 02:37.900
because the competition
has completely changed.

02:37.934 --> 02:39.034
[Nervous laughter]

02:39.069 --> 02:41.504
This season
three former champions

02:41.538 --> 02:46.208
will be investing in you guys by
becoming your personal coaches.

02:46.243 --> 02:47.343
What?

02:47.377 --> 02:50.880
Please welcome
your new champion coaches...

02:50.914 --> 02:52.548
[Cheers and applause]

02:52.582 --> 02:56.852
Oh, no way.

02:56.887 --> 03:00.022
Season two winner Rayce Bird.

03:03.059 --> 03:06.195
Season four winner
Anthony Kosar.

03:11.034 --> 03:12.935
And season three finalist

03:12.969 --> 03:15.504
and season five winner
Laura Tyler.

03:21.011 --> 03:22.211
This is mind-blowing.

03:22.245 --> 03:24.280
I can't wait to work
with these coaches.

03:24.314 --> 03:25.848
[Inhales]
Deep breath.

03:25.882 --> 03:27.283
So how are you guys doing?

03:27.317 --> 03:28.350
- Good.
- Fantastic.

03:28.385 --> 03:29.785
Glad to be back.

03:29.819 --> 03:32.121
Well, this is very exciting
because you guys have a lot

03:32.155 --> 03:35.457
of talent and expertise to share
with this season's contestants.

03:35.492 --> 03:40.529
Now, you guys are not the only
ones competing this season.

03:40.564 --> 03:44.800
Our returning champions are also
competing but not against you.

03:44.834 --> 03:47.336
They will be competing
against each other.

03:47.370 --> 03:49.538
- Oh, yeah.
- Sorry!

03:49.573 --> 03:51.640
- Oh, wow.
- Oh.

03:51.675 --> 03:53.809
All right, so here's
how this is going to work.

03:53.843 --> 03:57.546
Each champion will choose
five of you to join their team.

03:57.581 --> 04:00.015
If someone from their team
wins this season,

04:00.050 --> 04:01.750
that coach wins, as well,

04:01.785 --> 04:05.087
making them the first
two-time <i> Face Off</i> champion.

04:05.121 --> 04:06.488
That's awesome.

04:06.523 --> 04:10.092
However, if all of the members
of that team get eliminated,

04:10.126 --> 04:12.027
then the coach
gets eliminated as well.

04:12.062 --> 04:13.128
All: Aww.

04:13.163 --> 04:14.330
So today's challenge

04:14.364 --> 04:17.232
is critical because it will be
your only chance

04:17.267 --> 04:19.034
to prove that you have
what it takes

04:19.069 --> 04:22.538
to win before the coaches
handpick their teams.

04:22.572 --> 04:26.208
So are you ready to make
a great first impression?

04:26.242 --> 04:27.209
All: Yeah!

04:27.243 --> 04:30.846
- Whoo!
- [Applause]

04:30.880 --> 04:33.382
For your first
foundation challenge,

04:33.416 --> 04:36.885
you'll each pay tribute
to our returning champions

04:36.920 --> 04:39.121
by creating
a companion character

04:39.155 --> 04:42.458
that complements
one of their most iconic

04:42.492 --> 04:45.094
<i>Face Off</i> creations.

04:45.128 --> 04:48.330
All: - Aw.
- Oh.

04:48.365 --> 04:49.598
We have Rayce's cellist

04:49.633 --> 04:51.900
from our Tim Burton-inspired
challenge...

04:51.935 --> 04:54.169
Yeah.

04:54.204 --> 04:57.640
Anthony's
bioluminescent creature.

04:57.674 --> 04:59.675
Lastly, we have Laura's
Mother Earth creation

04:59.709 --> 05:03.579
from our Earth goddess
challenge.

05:03.613 --> 05:05.848
Now, on my go, the monitor
placed at each section

05:05.882 --> 05:09.284
will display the image
of one of these characters.

05:09.319 --> 05:11.487
There can only be
five companion characters

05:11.521 --> 05:13.856
for each
of our champion makeups.

05:13.890 --> 05:16.992
You better be quick to make sure
that you get the one you want.

05:17.027 --> 05:19.928
You have two hours
to complete this challenge.

05:19.963 --> 05:21.163
[Exhales]

05:21.197 --> 05:25.401
Good luck,
'cause your time starts now.

05:27.170 --> 05:30.005
Aah!

05:30.040 --> 05:31.373
- I want you.
- How you doing?

05:31.408 --> 05:32.641
- I'm Gregory.
- Nice to meet you, Gregory.

05:32.676 --> 05:33.642
Augustine.

05:33.677 --> 05:34.643
Nice to meet you.

05:34.678 --> 05:36.245
All right.

05:36.279 --> 05:40.282
I wish I had, like, three hands
and one fourth one to write.

05:40.316 --> 05:42.084
This is Rayce's side, I believe?

05:42.118 --> 05:43.352
- Yeah.
- Okay.

05:43.386 --> 05:44.486
I'm going to work
on your hair first

05:44.521 --> 05:45.921
to get that out of the way.

05:45.955 --> 05:47.523
My name is Emily Serpico.

05:47.557 --> 05:50.259
I'm the youngest contestant ever
on <i> Face Off,</i> which is really,

05:50.293 --> 05:51.627
really exciting.

05:51.661 --> 05:53.062
I live with my parents,

05:53.096 --> 05:54.930
and I'm going to
cosmetology school.

05:54.964 --> 05:57.433
I may be underestimated
because I'm so young,

05:57.467 --> 06:00.903
but I think people are gonna be
very surprised at what I can do.

06:00.937 --> 06:03.872
Did you see what Emily
is doing with the hairdo?

06:03.907 --> 06:05.274
It's like a hat.

06:05.308 --> 06:06.475
- Oh, that's cool.
- Yeah.

06:06.509 --> 06:07.976
So your story is,

06:08.011 --> 06:11.980
you are a poet who's inspired
by Rayce's cellist.

06:12.015 --> 06:13.348
Sweet.

06:13.383 --> 06:15.517
Where are the prosthetics?

06:18.455 --> 06:20.055
Ready to kick some ass.

06:20.090 --> 06:22.357
I am so excited to be here.

06:22.392 --> 06:24.626
I got Anthony's
bioluminescent character,

06:24.661 --> 06:27.096
and I instantly
run toward the prosthetics.

06:27.130 --> 06:29.465
Everybody's digging them up
like they're entrails,

06:29.499 --> 06:31.600
just flying all over the place.

06:31.634 --> 06:33.836
I find some pointy ears
and a brow piece,

06:33.870 --> 06:36.238
and I just start rocking it.

06:38.374 --> 06:39.541
I'm a trained artist,

06:39.576 --> 06:41.243
but I've always loved monsters.

06:41.277 --> 06:44.413
At 17 I started doing it
professionally, and I love it.

06:44.447 --> 06:46.849
It's the best job in the world.

06:46.883 --> 06:49.952
All right.

06:49.986 --> 06:51.787
- See, we've got Mother Nature.
- Yeah.

06:51.821 --> 06:53.388
- Now we want Father Time...
- Oh, sweet.

06:53.423 --> 06:56.024
So your head is gonna be
like a grandfather clock

06:56.059 --> 06:57.960
- grew into a tree.
- Okay.

06:57.994 --> 07:00.129
I have my own special effects
makeup shop,

07:00.163 --> 07:02.331
and I've been working on indie
films for about eight years

07:02.365 --> 07:03.665
in North Carolina.

07:03.700 --> 07:06.101
Being on <i> Face Off</i>
is a phenomenal opportunity

07:06.136 --> 07:08.170
for me to break
into bigger films

07:08.204 --> 07:11.473
and major Hollywood
blockbusters.

07:11.508 --> 07:15.450
I like the route Greg is going.
He's thinking outside the box.

07:15.484 --> 07:17.819
I really hope Laura picks me
to be on her team.

07:17.853 --> 07:19.621
So I went straight
towards Mother Earth,

07:19.655 --> 07:21.990
and I'm fabricating
this foam grandfather clock

07:22.024 --> 07:23.958
to impress her.

07:23.993 --> 07:24.993
Yeah, that's good.

07:28.998 --> 07:30.832
- You nervous?
- It's a lot of pressure, man.

07:30.867 --> 07:34.202
My concept is the antithesis
to Rayce's cellist.

07:34.237 --> 07:36.438
You're an angry techno DJ.

07:36.472 --> 07:37.672
It's a risky plan,

07:37.707 --> 07:39.941
but it's not unheard of
for companions to be

07:39.976 --> 07:42.444
very different from each other.

07:42.478 --> 07:44.145
He's going
to be very dark-featured

07:44.180 --> 07:46.915
with a prism laser light show
coming out of his face.

07:46.949 --> 07:48.717
- How long you been doing it?
- A year and a half.

07:48.751 --> 07:50.352
I don't actually
do it professionally.

07:50.386 --> 07:53.221
I've spent ten years in the Air
National Guard in California.

07:53.256 --> 07:56.391
I come from three generations
of military fighter pilots,

07:56.425 --> 07:58.493
but I've always had a passion
for the effects world,

07:58.528 --> 08:01.663
and I really feel like I need
to give myself the opportunity

08:01.697 --> 08:03.765
to pursue it and get paid
to do it.

08:03.799 --> 08:05.600
This is a dream right now.

08:12.041 --> 08:14.209
Got these, got this.
All right, cool.

08:14.243 --> 08:15.477
I'll be right back.

08:15.511 --> 08:17.379
I'm Stephanie, I'm 21 years old,

08:17.413 --> 08:20.649
and I work on the creative crew
of a haunted house.

08:20.683 --> 08:21.883
Eyelashes? Ooh.

08:21.918 --> 08:24.219
When I'm there,
I only have an hour to get

08:24.253 --> 08:25.854
30, 40 people done,

08:25.888 --> 08:28.924
so it's really gotten me ready
to tackle this competition.

08:28.958 --> 08:31.293
I'm making you
one of Mother Nature's babies.

08:31.327 --> 08:33.962
Whatever you need to win, do it.

08:42.837 --> 08:45.145
I am a creative director
in advertising.

08:46.409 --> 08:49.811
I started to do special effects
because of <i> Face Off,</i>

08:49.845 --> 08:52.747
but I've only been doing it
for about eight months.

08:52.782 --> 08:54.349
My concept for this character
is, like,

08:54.383 --> 08:57.586
a young brother version of
the character that Anthony did.

08:57.620 --> 08:59.220
Of course I'm nervous
and excited.

08:59.255 --> 09:01.423
I'm everything
in the same package.

09:14.704 --> 09:16.404
Uh, well,
it's matching Mother Earth,

09:16.439 --> 09:20.141
so I figure that you should be
like a protector kind of thing.

09:20.176 --> 09:21.276
I've been a makeup artist

09:21.310 --> 09:24.179
for approximately ten years,
self-taught.

09:24.213 --> 09:26.448
I'm also a prop maker
and suit actor,

09:26.482 --> 09:30.251
and since I'm 6'5" I normally
get asked to play the monster

09:30.286 --> 09:31.953
as well as do
the special effects.

09:31.988 --> 09:35.557
This isn't made for you
so I've got to fit it to you.

09:35.591 --> 09:37.859
There we go.

09:40.830 --> 09:43.632
Ooh, all right.
I like that he went flesh tone.

09:43.666 --> 09:45.367
It looks like a more human
version of yours.

09:45.401 --> 09:46.735
Right.

09:46.769 --> 09:48.937
My name is Julian.
I'm from Fremont, California.

09:48.971 --> 09:50.772
My character is a distant cousin

09:50.806 --> 09:53.008
of Anthony's
bioluminescent creature.

09:53.042 --> 09:54.175
Close your eyes.

09:54.210 --> 09:56.011
I went to cinema makeup school
in Los Angeles,

09:56.045 --> 09:57.712
and then I was working
for about five years

09:57.747 --> 09:59.581
before I moved back
to the Bay Area

09:59.615 --> 10:02.350
to help my parents care
for my younger brother Brent.

10:02.385 --> 10:06.154
He has a disease that affects
his speech and motor skills.

10:06.188 --> 10:07.922
Winning Face Off would mean
being able

10:07.957 --> 10:09.224
to help out my brother.

10:09.258 --> 10:11.393
It would also mean being able
to move back to LA

10:11.427 --> 10:13.561
for another shot at my career,

10:13.596 --> 10:17.499
so I'm gonna be going
for all the way.

10:17.533 --> 10:19.000
You guys are all doing great.

10:19.035 --> 10:20.915
You got one hour left.

10:20.950 --> 10:22.717
You're freaking me out now.

10:22.751 --> 10:24.485
I've never had
to create a character

10:24.520 --> 10:25.553
in this short amount of time,

10:25.588 --> 10:26.955
and I'm having a hell

10:26.989 --> 10:29.624
of a time layering
on these laser lines.

10:29.658 --> 10:31.559
Damn it.

10:31.594 --> 10:36.097
I cannot get that paint
to stay down thick.

10:36.131 --> 10:37.298
I start freaking out because I

10:37.333 --> 10:38.700
know the coaches
are watching me.

10:38.734 --> 10:41.002
This stuff's just
not cooperating with me at all.

10:41.036 --> 10:43.838
There's no stopping.
There's no asking for help,

10:43.872 --> 10:46.274
and I start thinking, "Am I
gonna be the only one out there

10:46.308 --> 10:48.109
with nothing?"

10:54.254 --> 10:56.289
We're in the middle of
our first foundation challenge.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.090
Three champions
from previous seasons

10:58.125 --> 10:59.959
are back to be our coaches.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.828
We are creating a companion
for one of their makeups.

11:02.863 --> 11:04.397
And I chose Rayce's cellist,

11:04.431 --> 11:06.966
and my character is supposed
to have what resembles

11:07.000 --> 11:09.936
the prism laser light show
coming out of his face,

11:09.970 --> 11:12.538
but I cannot get
that paint to stay down.

11:12.573 --> 11:14.440
I start freaking out,
because I know the coaches

11:14.474 --> 11:16.108
are watching me.
Dammit.

11:16.143 --> 11:19.111
And I'm desperately trying to
find something that will help.

11:19.146 --> 11:21.747
I think it's interesting
that Logan went black.

11:21.782 --> 11:23.783
Yeah, it's pretty dark
out of the gate.

11:25.118 --> 11:27.286
Finally,
I apply silver metallic paints

11:27.321 --> 11:28.788
that make the prosthetic pop,

11:28.822 --> 11:31.157
and I think
that's a good attempt at making

11:31.191 --> 11:33.626
it a little bit more dynamic.

11:33.660 --> 11:37.063
Yeah, that's better.

11:37.097 --> 11:39.398
Who'd Jamie end up getting?

11:39.433 --> 11:40.466
Oh, Rayce's.

11:40.500 --> 11:44.203
You're going to be a composer.

11:44.238 --> 11:46.075
I'm a sci-fi fantasy chick.

11:46.076 --> 11:49.881
I grew up with <i> Star Wars</i>
on VHS and laser.

11:49.916 --> 11:51.944
I've been working
as a freelance makeup artist

11:51.979 --> 11:53.212
for about three years.

11:53.247 --> 11:55.348
There aren't many women
in the effects industry,

11:55.382 --> 11:57.216
but we can keep up
with these boys,

11:57.251 --> 11:58.784
and I'm here to prove that.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.519
Blood, sweat, and tears,
I will give everything

12:00.554 --> 12:03.058
I got to be the next
<i>Face Off</i> champion.

12:05.659 --> 12:08.694
Oh, there's Ben.
He's got yours.

12:08.729 --> 12:10.363
- I'm doing Anthony's water guy.
- Uh-huh.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.932
I'm gonna turn
you into his princess.

12:12.966 --> 12:15.368
So crazy,
I never thought I'd ever be here.

12:15.402 --> 12:16.369
- Really?
- Yeah.

12:16.403 --> 12:20.706
I served in Iraq
from 2006 to 2007.

12:20.741 --> 12:23.342
I was a helicopter mechanic
in the Marine Corps.

12:23.377 --> 12:24.910
Growing up, I'd always sculpted,

12:24.945 --> 12:26.612
and I wanted
to fine-tune my skills,

12:26.647 --> 12:29.015
so when I got out of the Marines
I went to cinema makeup school.

12:29.049 --> 12:30.983
A couple of my friends,
kind of gave me a hard time.

12:31.018 --> 12:32.652
They thought that I was just
gonna be dressing hair

12:32.686 --> 12:33.986
and doing fingernail polish,

12:34.021 --> 12:35.655
but later when they saw
that I was making

12:35.689 --> 12:38.491
monsters and creatures they
were pretty blown away by it.

12:38.525 --> 12:40.192
Open up for me.

12:40.227 --> 12:41.560
That don't look too bad.

12:41.595 --> 12:44.330
Whoever thought that a big
burly guy could do makeup, huh?

12:47.601 --> 12:49.835
Regina's doing
what I would have done.

12:49.870 --> 12:51.871
Looks like she might be
putting on some ears?

12:51.905 --> 12:55.341
I'm Regina.
I'm 23 from Chicago, Illinois.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.310
I chose Laura's Mother Earth,

12:57.344 --> 12:59.779
and my character's gonna
be her daughter.

12:59.813 --> 13:02.448
I'm thinking "Woodland Nymph."

13:02.482 --> 13:04.216
I'm fine artist trained.

13:04.251 --> 13:06.719
I got into effects
four years ago.

13:06.753 --> 13:08.554
One of my teachers
from makeup school

13:08.588 --> 13:11.290
is Graham Schofield
from season six.

13:11.325 --> 13:13.993
When he was on the show
he made it pretty far,

13:14.027 --> 13:17.496
and I'm hoping
that I get to that point.

13:17.531 --> 13:20.466
Yeah, we're gonna
do other things.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.568
We're doing the fish guy,

13:22.602 --> 13:25.538
and you're going
to be a lionfish.

13:25.572 --> 13:26.739
I'm a concept designer

13:26.773 --> 13:28.974
and art director
for the theme park industry.

13:29.009 --> 13:32.044
I worked on rides
like <i> Transformers,</i> The Ride 3D.

13:32.079 --> 13:33.612
Actually, I wanted to pull out

13:33.647 --> 13:34.980
of theme parks
a number of years ago,

13:35.015 --> 13:37.216
and then I saw that
Neville Page's first project

13:37.250 --> 13:39.752
was designing aliens
on the <i> Men In Black</i> ride,

13:39.786 --> 13:44.357
and I was like, "Okay,
I'm gonna stay on this path."

13:44.391 --> 13:46.459
What I'm gonna do is I'm gonna
make you into the wizard

13:46.493 --> 13:48.894
that actually turned him
into the cello.

13:48.929 --> 13:50.463
I'm rob.
I'm 41 years old.

13:50.497 --> 13:51.997
I work as a collision technician

13:52.032 --> 13:54.667
at my family's collision shop
in Monroe, Michigan.

13:54.701 --> 13:57.036
Special effects
has been my favorite hobby

13:57.070 --> 13:58.537
since I was nine years old,

13:58.572 --> 14:01.207
but when my daughter was born
I took six years off.

14:01.241 --> 14:02.942
She was born with two holes
in her heart

14:02.976 --> 14:04.310
and down syndrome.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.611
Today she's eight years old.

14:05.645 --> 14:08.147
Her name's Riley.
Her holes in her heart are good.

14:08.181 --> 14:10.816
One night when we were watching
<i>Face Off</i> she brought me up one

14:10.851 --> 14:11.884
of my sculptures and said,

14:11.918 --> 14:13.319
"Daddy, you need to do this."

14:13.353 --> 14:14.987
It hit me, you know,
I was like, "Wow, you know,

14:15.021 --> 14:16.055
she understands this."

14:16.089 --> 14:18.090
So here I am.

14:21.061 --> 14:23.629
I'm basically making a version
of Father Time

14:23.663 --> 14:25.898
- to go with Mother Nature.
- Okay.

14:25.932 --> 14:27.700
I fell in love
with makeup in ninth grade.

14:27.734 --> 14:30.069
All throughout high school
I did proms, I did weddings.

14:30.103 --> 14:32.104
I'd create creatures
around Halloween.

14:32.139 --> 14:33.305
Now that I've been doing film

14:33.340 --> 14:34.807
and television makeup
for two years,

14:34.841 --> 14:36.542
I want to win <i> Face Off.</i>

14:36.576 --> 14:37.877
I'm a very competitive person,

14:37.911 --> 14:40.579
and I do not plan on going home.

14:42.282 --> 14:45.484
So I'm turning you
into a dead ballerina

14:45.519 --> 14:47.052
that dances to his music.

14:47.087 --> 14:48.287
Love it.

14:48.321 --> 14:50.222
Watching <i>Face Off</i>
really inspired me.

14:50.257 --> 14:52.425
I knew that I wanted to get
into the film industry,

14:52.459 --> 14:53.926
and I knew I loved makeup,

14:53.960 --> 14:56.695
but because of <i> Face Off</i>
I decided to go to school

14:56.730 --> 14:58.597
and learn the special effects
craft.

14:58.632 --> 15:00.199
After I finished school,

15:00.233 --> 15:02.034
I competed
in three different IMATs.

15:02.068 --> 15:04.103
I took first place twice.

15:06.873 --> 15:09.542
Time is running out and I'm
frantically blending edges,

15:09.576 --> 15:12.478
but the piece is too big
and it's covering her hairline.

15:12.512 --> 15:14.947
What am I gonna
do to cover this edge?

15:14.981 --> 15:18.083
And then I
see this giant pink flower,

15:18.118 --> 15:19.752
so I stick it on my model's head

15:19.786 --> 15:22.421
and I think, "This is burnin'."

15:22.456 --> 15:23.589
Ten minutes, guys.

15:23.623 --> 15:25.691
You have ten minutes left.

15:25.725 --> 15:27.526
Still time.

15:33.834 --> 15:35.501
Time's up, brushes down.

15:39.139 --> 15:42.408
Before I send the coaches
down to check out your work,

15:42.442 --> 15:44.810
I do have another surprise
for you.

15:44.845 --> 15:46.312
Of course.

15:46.646 --> 15:49.915
Hot off the set of <i>The Hunger</i>
<i>Games, Mockingjay</i> films,

15:49.949 --> 15:53.685
please welcome three time
Academy Award-winning makeup

15:53.720 --> 15:59.158
artist and <i> Face Off</i>
series judge, Ve Neill.

15:59.192 --> 16:01.627
- Hey, everybody!
- Hey, Ve!

16:01.661 --> 16:04.530
She's the Aretha Franklin
of the effects world.

16:04.564 --> 16:06.098
I thought I was excited before,

16:06.132 --> 16:08.534
and now I'm ecstatic.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.636
- Well, this is exciting.
- I know, isn't this great?

16:10.670 --> 16:13.005
- I am so happy to be back.
- All right, well are you

16:13.039 --> 16:15.040
ready to help these champs
go see some makeups?

16:15.074 --> 16:16.942
- Yeah, let's go.
- Okay.

16:16.976 --> 16:19.144
Hi, Rob.
Tell us about your character.

16:19.179 --> 16:20.445
He was a dark wizard

16:20.480 --> 16:22.347
that changed the person
to the cello.

16:22.382 --> 16:24.449
Tell me about the choice
of that prosthetic.

16:24.484 --> 16:26.685
I wanted to show the brokenness

16:26.719 --> 16:29.755
of the relationship between
the girl and the cello itself.

16:29.789 --> 16:31.523
I think you did
a really great job.

16:31.558 --> 16:33.091
It really reads wizard to me.

16:33.126 --> 16:34.793
- Very complete.
- Thank you.

16:34.828 --> 16:37.196
This is the ballerina

16:37.230 --> 16:39.865
that is dancing to the music
that is constantly playing.

16:39.899 --> 16:41.967
Explain to me some
of the coloration you chose.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.268
I saw the skirt.

16:43.303 --> 16:44.837
That's why I went with the pinks

16:44.871 --> 16:46.672
and the darker reds
for the shading.

16:46.706 --> 16:50.209
You did a really nice blending
job on just a stock piece.

16:50.243 --> 16:51.643
You've got it down pretty well.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.278
Thanks so much.
Thank you.

16:58.318 --> 17:00.853
So you were going off
of Anthony's character.

17:00.887 --> 17:02.654
Yes, this is a monk lionfish.

17:02.689 --> 17:04.990
You as an artist, how do you
see yourself in this character?

17:05.023 --> 17:07.125
Conceptually this is very
much me.

17:07.160 --> 17:08.894
I like a lot
of story in the character.

17:08.928 --> 17:10.127
Those kind of apes can be risky,

17:10.163 --> 17:11.630
'cause they can hide
some of the details.

17:11.664 --> 17:13.432
Good job on making
the correct choices

17:13.465 --> 17:15.367
- and put them in the right spots.
- Great job, Adam.

17:15.401 --> 17:16.367
Thank you.

17:16.402 --> 17:18.704
This is my lovely sea sorceress.

17:18.738 --> 17:20.705
I like that you put the stripes

17:20.740 --> 17:22.641
like Anthony
had his blue stripes.

17:22.675 --> 17:24.609
I like the way
you painted around the eyes

17:24.644 --> 17:26.712
and the contacts that you chose,
as well as the pie.

17:26.746 --> 17:28.647
It really makes her eyes
look really big.

17:28.681 --> 17:30.482
Thank you.

17:35.655 --> 17:39.591
So I wanted to make Mother
Nature's dad, Father Time.

17:39.626 --> 17:41.860
He basically is a grumpy
old hermit.

17:41.895 --> 17:43.962
So how many prosthetics
does he have on?

17:43.997 --> 17:46.064
Four, he has a brow piece,
two jowls,

17:46.099 --> 17:47.566
and then a neck piece.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.735
Well, nice job, I think
he looks like an old man.

17:49.769 --> 17:51.904
- Good job, Anthony.
- Thank you.

17:51.938 --> 17:55.040
This is a version
of Father Time,

17:55.074 --> 17:58.377
and I wanted to do
a grandfather clock up here.

17:58.411 --> 17:59.745
We didn't really know
where you were going.

17:59.779 --> 18:02.247
It was very unpredictable,
which I think was a good thing.

18:02.282 --> 18:04.116
A good idea.

18:09.055 --> 18:10.856
So what did you guys
think the makeups?

18:10.890 --> 18:13.025
I think, overall, we were
really impressed with everything

18:13.059 --> 18:15.694
you guys did, and I don't think
there's one person

18:15.728 --> 18:18.330
that we don't think
can take this thing all the way.

18:18.364 --> 18:20.499
- Yeah, great job guys.
- Ve?

18:20.533 --> 18:22.267
Well, I think
there were some very creative

18:22.302 --> 18:23.902
and innovative choices made

18:23.937 --> 18:27.072
today, and I'm really
excited about this season.

18:27.106 --> 18:29.541
All right, guys,
it's time to pick your teams.

18:29.575 --> 18:32.110
Now, we chose this order
by random draw.

18:32.145 --> 18:34.613
Laura, you're up first.

18:34.647 --> 18:36.848
This was so hard.

18:36.883 --> 18:39.151
This choice is so important.

18:39.185 --> 18:41.920
If you don't have
a good framework to work off of,

18:41.955 --> 18:43.255
then your house will fall.

18:43.289 --> 18:46.291
My first pick is...

18:51.131 --> 18:53.131
Laura, who is the first contestant

18:53.132 --> 18:54.466
you'd like
to have join your team.

18:54.500 --> 18:57.936
I picked this person because I
thought their application

18:57.970 --> 18:59.037
was nearly flawless,

18:59.071 --> 19:00.305
I loved their color choices,

19:00.339 --> 19:01.740
and I felt like their character

19:01.774 --> 19:04.176
really fit the parameters
of this challenge.

19:04.210 --> 19:07.212
So I have to go with Darla.

19:09.115 --> 19:10.315
I'm so excited,

19:10.349 --> 19:12.784
not only to be
the first one chosen,

19:12.818 --> 19:14.252
but to be chosen by Laura.

19:14.287 --> 19:16.688
She's been
through two full seasons,

19:16.722 --> 19:20.759
and I can't wait to hear
all that she has to offer.

19:20.793 --> 19:22.360
- Good first choice.
- Rayce.

19:22.395 --> 19:23.562
To me there's many things

19:23.596 --> 19:25.597
that define success
in this competition.

19:25.631 --> 19:28.333
Attention to detail is one
of those I'd like to push so,

19:28.367 --> 19:30.599
Adam, you're on my team, man.

19:34.140 --> 19:35.373
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, man.

19:35.408 --> 19:36.541
Anthony.

19:36.576 --> 19:40.617
My first pick
would actually have been Adam.

19:40.651 --> 19:42.785
There's something
about his visual storytelling.

19:42.820 --> 19:44.787
But Rayce steals him
at the last second.

19:44.822 --> 19:46.923
I really liked her application
of color

19:46.957 --> 19:49.159
and the use
of the depth of color.

19:49.193 --> 19:51.394
I choose Kelly.

19:55.933 --> 19:57.267
Laura, your next pick.

19:57.301 --> 20:00.470
My next pick is someone
who had an amazing application,

20:00.504 --> 20:04.207
so I'm gonna
have to pick Julian.

20:05.743 --> 20:07.377
- Rayce.
- Please don't pick Anthony.

20:07.411 --> 20:09.512
Nobody pick Anthony.
I really want to pick him next.

20:09.547 --> 20:12.482
Anthony, you did a great job.
Get over here.

20:12.516 --> 20:14.884
Aw, man.

20:14.919 --> 20:16.853
Welcome to the team.

20:16.887 --> 20:19.756
- Anthony.
- Alan.

20:21.592 --> 20:22.659
Laura.

20:22.693 --> 20:25.128
So far Laura's
picked Darla and Julian.

20:25.162 --> 20:26.563
There's only a few spots left

20:26.597 --> 20:29.098
and I really want to be
on her team.

20:29.133 --> 20:30.800
Emily.

20:32.403 --> 20:36.105
And there goes another person.

20:36.140 --> 20:38.241
Rob.

20:38.275 --> 20:41.344
Ben.

20:41.378 --> 20:44.547
Laura.

20:44.582 --> 20:46.449
Gregory.

20:46.483 --> 20:47.750
Now that she's picked me,

20:47.785 --> 20:49.352
I'm definitely gonna
bring it for her,

20:49.386 --> 20:52.622
because I want to show her that
I deserve a place on her team.

20:52.656 --> 20:58.094
- Logan, get over here.
- All right.

20:58.128 --> 21:02.198
- Daniel.
- Yes!

21:02.233 --> 21:03.499
Welcome.

21:03.534 --> 21:06.736
I'm gonna
have to go with Stephanie.

21:09.106 --> 21:13.109
Regina, welcome to the team.

21:15.813 --> 21:17.313
Jamie, come on.
We're gonna have a lot of fun.

21:17.348 --> 21:18.781
Yay!

21:22.987 --> 21:26.055
Congratulations, everyone,
on your new teams.

21:26.090 --> 21:28.558
I know it's been
quite an exciting day,

21:28.592 --> 21:32.462
but before I send you off
to move into your new house,

21:32.496 --> 21:37.634
there's just one more piece
of business to attend to.

21:37.668 --> 21:40.937
The champions weren't the only
ones making picks today.

21:40.971 --> 21:43.473
Ve has selected
her own favorites

21:43.507 --> 21:46.809
and a winner for
today's foundation challenge.

21:46.844 --> 21:48.111
That means one of you

21:48.145 --> 21:51.714
will receive immunity in
the first spotlight challenge,

21:51.749 --> 21:54.150
increasing not just
your odds of surviving

21:54.184 --> 21:56.653
but your coach's as well.

21:56.687 --> 21:58.955
Having immunity
for the first round

21:58.989 --> 22:02.425
would especially be good,
because I won't be as panicked

22:02.459 --> 22:05.428
because I know
I'm not going home first.

22:05.462 --> 22:07.130
So this is the big moment, Ve.

22:07.164 --> 22:09.032
Who created your favorite looks?

22:09.066 --> 22:11.467
My first choice is Rob.

22:11.502 --> 22:14.937
You did a really great job of
picking some unusual components

22:14.972 --> 22:16.739
and making
a very cohesive character,

22:16.774 --> 22:18.608
and I love the texture
in the makeup.

22:18.642 --> 22:19.776
Thank you so much.

22:19.810 --> 22:23.012
Darla, you did a beautiful
clean makeup.

22:23.047 --> 22:26.649
I loved your backstory,
and she was just adorable.

22:26.684 --> 22:27.817
Thank you.

22:27.851 --> 22:30.620
Ve, who is the winner
of this challenge?

22:30.654 --> 22:35.425
The winner is...

22:35.459 --> 22:38.027
Darla.

22:38.062 --> 22:41.998
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

22:42.032 --> 22:44.567
Darla,
you created the best companion

22:44.601 --> 22:46.602
- for Rayce's cellist.
- Thank you so much.

22:46.637 --> 22:48.137
Really, really wonderful
story, darling.

22:48.172 --> 22:50.773
Thank you.
I am ecstatic to win immunity.

22:50.808 --> 22:53.209
I'm feeling sheer joy
and excitement,

22:53.243 --> 22:55.378
and a little bit
of shock, maybe, too.

22:55.412 --> 22:57.146
Darla, congratulations.

22:57.181 --> 22:59.282
As the winner
of today's foundation challenge,

22:59.316 --> 23:02.952
you have earned immunity in
the first spotlight challenge.

23:02.986 --> 23:05.188
- How's that feel?
- Awesome.

23:05.222 --> 23:07.390
Darla so deserved this win.

23:07.424 --> 23:09.192
She made all the right
decisions.

23:09.226 --> 23:11.661
Say good-bye
to your new coaches for now,

23:11.695 --> 23:15.031
and I will see you soon for
your first spotlight challenge.

23:15.065 --> 23:18.167
- Goodnight.
- Welcome to <i> Face Off!</i>

23:28.045 --> 23:29.679
As soon
as we go through the gate

23:29.713 --> 23:31.814
and I see the scale
of the house,

23:31.849 --> 23:33.282
that's when it hits me.

23:33.317 --> 23:36.552
I'm finally here,
and it feels really good.

23:36.587 --> 23:39.155
- Wow.
- Guys!

23:39.189 --> 23:41.457
I'm not believing
this is happening.

23:41.492 --> 23:44.427
This house is just incredible.

23:44.461 --> 23:46.863
- Aw, man.
- Oh, my God.

23:46.897 --> 23:50.099
There's these black-and-white
photographs of Anthony, Rayce's,

23:50.134 --> 23:51.434
and Laura's work.

23:51.468 --> 23:52.568
And that's another moment we're,

23:52.603 --> 23:54.670
like, "We're here."

23:54.705 --> 23:56.339
I have never lived in a place

23:56.373 --> 23:58.408
- this nice.
- Ow!

23:58.442 --> 24:00.543
I'm gonna call this home
for as long as I can be here,

24:00.577 --> 24:01.911
and hopefully I'm here
a long time.

24:01.945 --> 24:04.680
All: Season eight!

24:10.554 --> 24:12.155
- It is hot.
- What is this?

24:12.189 --> 24:14.857
This is crazy.

24:14.892 --> 24:16.325
I think they're leaving us
here to die.

24:16.360 --> 24:18.394
Today is
our first spotlight challenge,

24:18.429 --> 24:20.196
and we are at Vasquez Rocks.

24:20.230 --> 24:23.566
And this has been the place
for many, many, many movies,

24:23.600 --> 24:26.669
and I don't know really
what to expect.

24:26.703 --> 24:28.426
- What is that?
- Oh, my gosh.

24:28.427 --> 24:30.871
We see all these
alien crash sites

24:30.872 --> 24:32.402
and it is crazy.

24:33.575 --> 24:36.044
- That's awesome.
- We round this corner

24:36.078 --> 24:39.547
and then I see this
gorgeous flowing white ponytail.

24:39.581 --> 24:40.782
No way.

24:40.816 --> 24:43.217
Oh, my God.

24:43.252 --> 24:45.219
Holy shit, it's Rick Baker.

24:45.254 --> 24:47.555
Oh, I'm not gonna geek out.
Be cool.

24:52.778 --> 24:53.911
- No way.
- It's Rick Baker.

24:53.946 --> 24:55.980
- Oh, my God.
- Oh!

24:56.014 --> 25:00.651
Rick Baker is "the" makeup
artist, so seeing him is just...

25:00.686 --> 25:01.686
I'm speechless.

25:01.720 --> 25:02.820
- That's awesome.
- No way.

25:02.854 --> 25:04.555
- Is this real life?
- Oh, my goodness.

25:04.590 --> 25:06.757
This is, like, my biggest idol.

25:06.792 --> 25:07.792
I start shaking.

25:07.826 --> 25:10.228
I actually get a tear in my eye.

25:11.296 --> 25:13.136
It gives me great pleasure

25:13.170 --> 25:16.339
to introduce someone who
really needs no introduction.

25:16.373 --> 25:17.941
Legendary makeup artist

25:17.975 --> 25:22.145
and seven time Academy
Award-winner, Rick Baker.

25:22.179 --> 25:26.849
[Cheers and applause]

25:26.884 --> 25:30.553
It's an incredible honor to have
you here with us, is it not?

25:30.587 --> 25:31.754
All: Yes!

25:31.789 --> 25:33.423
You're gonna make me blush,
McKenzie.

25:33.457 --> 25:35.658
That's my goal.

25:35.693 --> 25:38.461
Now you have made
so many memorable makeups

25:38.495 --> 25:40.396
across an incredibly diverse
range

25:40.431 --> 25:43.466
of films like <i> American Werewolf</i>
<i>In London,</i>

25:43.500 --> 25:45.902
<i>Men In Black</i> trilogy, <i>Star Wars,</i>

25:45.936 --> 25:47.070
<i>Planet Of The Apes.</i>

25:47.104 --> 25:48.571
I mean, just small stuff
we got going on here.

25:48.605 --> 25:50.640
[Laughter]

25:50.674 --> 25:52.642
What are some
of your personal favorites?

25:52.676 --> 25:54.944
I would say Harry
from <i>Harry And The Hendersons</i>

25:54.979 --> 25:56.279
is one of my all-time favorites.

25:56.313 --> 25:58.214
I'm pretty pleased
with that one.

25:58.248 --> 26:01.384
All right, guys, let's talk
about where we are today.

26:01.418 --> 26:04.287
This is Double B Ranch
at Vasquez Rocks,

26:04.321 --> 26:07.156
where countless
blockbuster films like

26:07.191 --> 26:08.858
<i>Cowboys And Aliens, Iron Man,</i>

26:08.892 --> 26:10.793
and <i> Transformers 2</i>
have been shot.

26:10.828 --> 26:12.161
Filmmakers come here

26:12.196 --> 26:15.298
when they're looking
for an otherworldly landscape,

26:15.332 --> 26:18.194
and that brings me to your first
spotlight challenge.

26:19.703 --> 26:23.062
You'll work with your champion-lead
teams of five.

26:23.140 --> 26:26.542
Select one of the unique
extraterrestrial crash sites

26:26.577 --> 26:27.810
around you here,

26:27.845 --> 26:30.880
and use the evidence
from the wreckage as inspiration

26:30.914 --> 26:34.817
for two aliens that might have
emerged from that crash.

26:34.852 --> 26:36.786
Oh, my God.
I love aliens,

26:36.820 --> 26:39.889
so I am so
excited for this challenge.

26:39.923 --> 26:42.358
Why don't you go ahead
and stand with your teammates.

26:42.392 --> 26:43.492
Winning team right here?

26:43.527 --> 26:45.895
[Overlapping chatter]

26:45.929 --> 26:48.097
We got this.

26:48.131 --> 26:50.066
All right, guys.
I have a big surprise for you.

26:50.100 --> 26:54.136
Rick will be joining us
on the reveal stage,

26:54.171 --> 26:59.442
but he's also going to consult
on your designs today.

27:01.311 --> 27:02.678
I'm gonna start crying.

27:02.713 --> 27:05.248
What are you gonna be looking
for in their final makeups?

27:05.282 --> 27:07.250
The good thing
about doing an alien

27:07.284 --> 27:08.517
is that you can do anything,

27:08.552 --> 27:09.719
but just because you can do
anything

27:09.753 --> 27:11.120
doesn't mean that you should.

27:11.154 --> 27:14.223
I would like to see a nice
clean, well-thought out design

27:14.258 --> 27:17.093
that I'd recognize as something
that's definitely alien.

27:17.127 --> 27:18.427
You know, something
like Glenn Hetrick.

27:18.462 --> 27:20.730
- [Laughter]
- You know what I mean?

27:20.764 --> 27:23.599
Oh, you went there.
Wow, okay.

27:23.634 --> 27:25.935
All right, it's time
to get started, guys.

27:25.969 --> 27:28.871
On my go I want
you to select a crash site

27:28.906 --> 27:30.606
and begin working
on your concepts.

27:30.641 --> 27:33.643
Rick will come by shortly
to collaborate with you.

27:33.677 --> 27:35.778
- Is everyone ready?
- Yes.

27:35.812 --> 27:37.676
All right, go.

27:41.785 --> 27:42.818
- Oh, I got it.
- Get it, get it,

27:42.853 --> 27:45.554
- get it, get it.
- You want this one?

27:45.589 --> 27:46.856
Oh, my God.

27:46.890 --> 27:48.357
I just touched it, it's gooey.

27:48.392 --> 27:51.761
Team Laura,
we got to the egg crash site.

27:51.795 --> 27:53.062
It's organic,

27:53.096 --> 27:56.032
so we can think about
natural lifelike creatures.

27:56.066 --> 27:57.934
Very, very slimy.

27:57.968 --> 27:58.935
There's gold right here.

27:58.969 --> 28:00.336
What would they do with it?

28:00.370 --> 28:03.139
Team Anthony picks the crash
site that has the aircraft

28:03.173 --> 28:04.573
that's all blown to pieces,

28:04.608 --> 28:07.777
and there's guns, missiles,
gold.

28:07.811 --> 28:09.745
It's just a big hodgepodge
of craziness.

28:09.751 --> 28:12.315
This is the liquid they use to be
able to live in our atmosphere.

28:12.349 --> 28:14.050
We could do an alien
in another alien world.

28:14.084 --> 28:15.451
- I like that.
- Yeah.

28:15.485 --> 28:18.788
Team Rayce picks the crash
site with the cryogenic pod

28:18.822 --> 28:20.890
and alien crystals
coming out of the ground.

28:20.924 --> 28:23.192
All right,
so let's get a little powwow

28:23.226 --> 28:26.529
going for character design.

28:27.531 --> 28:29.098
You guys want to do spines

28:29.132 --> 28:30.533
on the top
of the head, on the back?

28:30.567 --> 28:32.101
It could be on the back
of the arm too.

28:32.135 --> 28:34.804
Maybe we can make it look like
the big monster has four legs,

28:34.838 --> 28:36.772
but then give the little monster
little...

28:36.807 --> 28:38.641
- Hi, Rick.
- Hey!

28:38.675 --> 28:43.512
My team just barely starts
sketching and I look over.

28:43.547 --> 28:48.184
Rick Bakers sitting right next
to me and I'm just...

28:48.218 --> 28:49.752
What's your concept here?
What are you thinking?

28:49.786 --> 28:52.455
Since there's a drill,
they go from planet to planet

28:52.489 --> 28:54.290
and just take
whatever they want to,

28:54.324 --> 28:55.458
and we're thinking there's gonna

28:55.492 --> 28:58.894
be a warrior
that protects a little alien.

28:58.929 --> 29:01.697
So the little alien is the one
that controls the plane

29:01.732 --> 29:03.466
and it's gonna wear a helmet
all the time,

29:03.500 --> 29:05.801
and then the larger alien
is the protector.

29:05.836 --> 29:07.103
When they get
out of the aircraft,

29:07.137 --> 29:08.938
he's the one
that's gonna protect her.

29:08.972 --> 29:11.007
My only worry,
and since it is <i>Face Off</i>

29:11.041 --> 29:12.341
and it's supposed
to be about makeup,

29:12.376 --> 29:14.577
if one of them is just a helmet,
I don't know.

29:14.611 --> 29:17.913
It seems kind of like a cop out
if you don't see what's inside.

29:19.783 --> 29:21.951
- Hey, guys.
- Hello.

29:21.985 --> 29:23.185
What's going on here?

29:23.220 --> 29:24.687
We are piecing together

29:24.721 --> 29:27.356
a story from this alien
drunk driver-ing.

29:27.391 --> 29:28.491
What do you think happened here?

29:28.525 --> 29:30.359
This is clearly
not a and-alone ship,

29:30.394 --> 29:31.727
so it's a escape pod,

29:31.762 --> 29:34.930
and then we have the mutilated
deer over there so...

29:34.965 --> 29:36.365
- Who did that?
- Well,

29:36.400 --> 29:39.602
this is a predatory Cro Magnon
species relative to this planet.

29:39.636 --> 29:41.837
So do you have some designs
for these things yet, or...

29:41.872 --> 29:44.807
For the Neanderthal style I
thought, "We are in the desert,"

29:44.841 --> 29:45.908
so the most resilient thing

29:45.942 --> 29:47.810
that popped in my head was
a king scorpion.

29:47.844 --> 29:49.111
It's arachnid,

29:49.146 --> 29:51.680
so it'll be a combination
of spider, scorpion,

29:51.715 --> 29:53.149
and grasshopper with,

29:53.183 --> 29:55.751
like, a black outer shell,
and the tissue inside

29:55.786 --> 29:57.720
is either pink or red.
I don't want to go purple.

29:57.754 --> 29:59.221
I thought it was a little
too hokey.

29:59.256 --> 30:01.557
Yeah, I don't know
that it's too hokey.

30:01.591 --> 30:03.626
I like the idea
of a nice contrast like that.

30:03.660 --> 30:05.127
Okay,

30:05.162 --> 30:08.831
and then they've been working on
the higher intelligence alien.

30:08.865 --> 30:11.667
We're going with an old,
aged wiser look,

30:11.701 --> 30:13.102
and it's a water-based creature

30:13.136 --> 30:15.204
that is capable
of interstellar travel

30:15.238 --> 30:17.506
and that resembles
more traditional aliens.

30:17.541 --> 30:19.208
Sounds like you guys
have some go ideas,

30:19.242 --> 30:22.511
and I'm really curious
to see the final results.

30:27.984 --> 30:30.519
So what are you thinking
happened here?

30:30.554 --> 30:33.989
An alien transplanted
three eggs onto a desert.

30:34.024 --> 30:36.859
As they landed,
two of 'em got out,

30:36.893 --> 30:39.462
and the aliens
that came out of it are aquatic

30:39.496 --> 30:41.997
instead of desert creatures.

30:42.032 --> 30:43.566
We're gonna
have one more developed.

30:43.600 --> 30:45.601
So it's going to blend
into the surroundings,

30:45.635 --> 30:47.536
and the youngest one
just hatched,

30:47.571 --> 30:51.607
and the female's gonna
be more smooth and slimy.

30:51.641 --> 30:54.176
We were also gonna
go with claws.

30:54.211 --> 30:55.344
Mm-hmm.

30:55.378 --> 30:56.378
But we didn't want
to be too earthy.

30:56.413 --> 30:57.980
"Too earthy"
meaning like earth...

30:58.014 --> 30:59.482
Earth creature, yeah.

30:59.516 --> 31:01.417
I get into this all the time
with Barry Sonnenfeld

31:01.451 --> 31:02.852
when I'm doing the
<i>Men In Black</i> movies.

31:02.886 --> 31:04.420
He says, "You know,

31:04.454 --> 31:06.589
do something that doesn't look
like it's from this planet."

31:06.623 --> 31:08.624
So I do something that doesn't
have eyes and a mouth,

31:08.658 --> 31:10.659
and he goes, "I can't tell where
he's looking and how am I gonna

31:10.694 --> 31:13.496
know when he's talking if he
doesn't have eyes or a mouth?"

31:13.530 --> 31:15.431
You know,
so it's a delicate balance.

31:15.465 --> 31:17.299
Hearing Rick give us advice
about our makeup,

31:17.334 --> 31:19.301
it's probably one
of the greatest moments

31:19.336 --> 31:21.103
I can ever say,
like, happened to me.

31:21.138 --> 31:23.272
'Cause I mean, it is Rick Baker.

31:23.306 --> 31:24.707
Okay, so we've got enough down.

31:24.741 --> 31:25.908
We've got enough pictures.

31:25.942 --> 31:27.443
Let's go to the lab
and get started on this.

31:27.477 --> 31:30.646
Sounds good.

31:30.680 --> 31:32.047
Hey, does anyone want to go
for a ride in the jeep?

31:40.724 --> 31:43.492
Hey, guys!

31:43.527 --> 31:46.228
We walk into the lab and it
hits me for the first time,

31:46.263 --> 31:47.763
"Oh, my gosh,
we're finally here."

31:47.797 --> 31:48.831
Oh, my God.

31:48.865 --> 31:52.334
This is the lab of my dreams.

31:52.369 --> 31:55.371
There's an entire wall of
Kryolan Aqua Color,

31:55.405 --> 31:57.773
amazing wigs,
and fabrication stuff

31:57.807 --> 31:58.974
that I could never afford.

31:59.009 --> 32:00.376
It's like Christmas over here.

32:00.410 --> 32:03.579
I'm used to working
in my parents' garage...

32:03.613 --> 32:04.914
half of a garage.

32:04.948 --> 32:08.851
So this is just unbelievable.

32:08.885 --> 32:11.887
So let's get moving.
Got to get some clay.

32:11.922 --> 32:14.557
My team has a really solid
concept, I think,

32:14.591 --> 32:16.926
but now we have to get sculpting
as soon as possible,

32:16.960 --> 32:19.161
because we only have six
and a half hours in the lab

32:19.196 --> 32:21.664
today.

32:23.366 --> 32:25.901
The delegation is first order
of business.

32:25.936 --> 32:28.037
I am sculpting the cowl
for the arachnid.

32:28.071 --> 32:29.939
Regina's sculpting the face.

32:29.973 --> 32:33.275
Rob volunteers for fabrication.

32:33.310 --> 32:35.511
- So you want me to cover ears?
- Yeah.

32:35.545 --> 32:37.213
I'm gonna build it out here

32:37.247 --> 32:38.948
and then carve
in more of the divots.

32:38.982 --> 32:41.550
As I'm working
on the face sculpt

32:41.585 --> 32:43.752
for our higher intelligence
alien, I'm trying to do

32:43.787 --> 32:46.589
these geometrically-shaped
mechanical gills over the mouth.

32:46.623 --> 32:48.924
Do you want
them to be the same size,

32:48.959 --> 32:51.527
because it's saying "repetition"
and then in your mind

32:51.561 --> 32:52.795
it's saying "mechanical."

32:52.829 --> 32:55.431
Sculpting mechanical parts
is not easy.

32:55.465 --> 32:57.199
Pinch that in a little bit.

32:57.234 --> 32:59.235
I know
that Anthony just started,

32:59.269 --> 33:02.638
but there's some fundamental
form language issues with it,

33:02.672 --> 33:04.006
and I'm really worried
about that.

33:04.040 --> 33:05.241
If you have different sizes,

33:05.275 --> 33:07.142
there's more organic language
happening here.

33:07.177 --> 33:09.878
Yeah.

33:09.913 --> 33:11.513
So we're now calling it
like "The Older"

33:11.548 --> 33:12.748
- and "The Younger."
- Okay.

33:12.782 --> 33:14.049
Our concept

33:14.084 --> 33:17.052
is that one of them
hatched earlier than the other

33:17.087 --> 33:20.456
and has already started
adapting to its environment.

33:20.490 --> 33:23.158
The things that we would really
like to accomplish today

33:23.193 --> 33:25.661
are both faces and both cowls,

33:25.695 --> 33:28.831
as well as the back piece
for our older alien.

33:28.865 --> 33:30.566
Luckily, that's five pieces

33:30.600 --> 33:32.134
and we have five people
on our team.

33:32.168 --> 33:35.938
Only concern, maybe that
these are getting a bit thick

33:35.972 --> 33:38.107
and this might be a bit thick.

33:38.141 --> 33:39.375
So this is the first time

33:39.409 --> 33:42.077
we get to see
any of the artists sculpt.

33:42.112 --> 33:44.580
And you might just want to make
the back the interesting part

33:44.614 --> 33:45.881
and keep all of this smooth.

33:45.915 --> 33:48.734
And I'm feeling
like I got a pretty strong team.

33:48.735 --> 33:50.468
I'm gonna make you a...
Gonna make you a thing.

33:51.688 --> 33:53.022
Uh, how are you guys
doing your ears?

33:53.056 --> 33:54.590
Oh, yeah.
We didn't talk about ears.

33:54.624 --> 33:55.958
With our concept,

33:55.992 --> 34:00.129
we have the big male brute
and our small female pilot.

34:00.163 --> 34:02.031
Ooh, yeah, right there.

34:02.065 --> 34:04.133
I'm sculpting the male face

34:04.167 --> 34:07.336
while Daniel
is sculpting the cowl.

34:07.370 --> 34:10.005
Alan is fabricating armor
for the suits.

34:10.040 --> 34:12.675
Jamie is sculpting
the female face,

34:12.708 --> 34:16.178
and Ben is blocking the cowl
for her.

34:16.212 --> 34:19.648
Can you see the glimmer
of sweat on my forehead?

34:19.683 --> 34:22.717
Anything that's gonna be
humanoid is going to have

34:22.752 --> 34:24.987
a similar muscle structure
as what our own is.

34:25.021 --> 34:27.121
I definitely know
what the judges are looking for

34:27.157 --> 34:29.024
and anatomy is always a key part
of it.

34:29.059 --> 34:30.693
- Pull that out.
- Yeah.

34:30.726 --> 34:33.929
They'll look like it's kind
of pulling in a little more.

34:33.963 --> 34:35.531
- Yeah.
- Even though these are aliens,

34:35.565 --> 34:40.803
they have to still be based on
some kind of realistic anatomy.

34:43.639 --> 34:44.672
Hi, everybody.

34:44.708 --> 34:46.375
Hey, Mr. Westmore!

34:46.409 --> 34:48.976
Mr. Westmore is a legend
in the effects industry.

34:49.012 --> 34:50.746
He's an Oscar winner,
and if there's one thing

34:50.780 --> 34:52.114
I've learned
from watching the show

34:52.148 --> 34:54.717
is if he gives you advice,
you take it.

34:54.751 --> 34:55.918
Let's see
what you have going here.

34:55.952 --> 34:57.419
Now what is this one
supposed to be?

34:57.454 --> 34:58.854
This is the aquatic one.

34:58.888 --> 35:01.890
What we're trying to do is
basically make horizontal gills

35:01.925 --> 35:05.394
almost like a respirator
to give it this fishy vibe.

35:05.428 --> 35:08.397
Mm-hmm.
It doesn't read that way though.

35:08.431 --> 35:11.133
You're coming down here,
you've got lines here,

35:11.167 --> 35:12.167
and these are straight.

35:12.202 --> 35:13.435
- It's all over the place.
- Okay.

35:13.470 --> 35:16.438
It's really gonna
look amateurish.

35:16.473 --> 35:17.673
You have a big sculpting
background?

35:17.707 --> 35:19.742
- Mm-hmm.
- You do? All right.

35:19.776 --> 35:21.844
My heart drops into my stomach.

35:21.878 --> 35:23.512
The fact that Mr. Westmore

35:23.546 --> 35:26.882
is questioning my sculpting
abilities... that's scary.

35:26.916 --> 35:28.150
It needs a lot more work.

35:28.184 --> 35:29.685
It is the first challenge,

35:29.719 --> 35:32.788
and I'm losing my mind.

35:37.069 --> 35:40.070
You see what I mean here,
where you're coming down here?

35:40.105 --> 35:41.672
- It's all over the place.
- Okay.

35:41.706 --> 35:43.807
It's really gonna
look amateurish.

35:43.842 --> 35:45.909
It's day
one of our alien challenge,

35:45.944 --> 35:48.312
and Mr. Westmore
doesn't like my sculpture.

35:48.346 --> 35:49.613
Do you have a big sculpting
background?

35:49.648 --> 35:51.515
- Mm-hmm.
- You do? All right.

35:51.549 --> 35:52.816
It needs a lot more work.

35:52.851 --> 35:54.852
It's like,
"Where do I go from here?

35:54.886 --> 35:55.919
What am I supposed to do?"

35:55.954 --> 35:57.788
I don't...
I don't know.

35:57.822 --> 35:58.922
I'm lost.

35:58.957 --> 36:00.424
I know there's a lot more work
to do.

36:00.458 --> 36:01.692
Yeah.

36:01.726 --> 36:03.294
Just be careful
with the angular point to it.

36:03.328 --> 36:04.395
It can still be angular,

36:04.429 --> 36:06.463
but it needs a lot more work.

36:06.498 --> 36:07.965
Now let's see the cowl there.

36:07.999 --> 36:11.635
In my mind I'm going towards
this ancient sea reptile.

36:11.670 --> 36:12.903
Mm-hmm.
All these little angles,

36:12.937 --> 36:14.972
all these little things
you have in here, roll them.

36:15.006 --> 36:18.042
Not just scars in the sculpture.

36:18.076 --> 36:20.644
Otherwise it's just gonna look
like you took a tool

36:20.679 --> 36:22.179
- and scratched through it.
- Right, right.

36:22.213 --> 36:23.881
Good, let's see the other
pieces.

36:23.915 --> 36:25.182
That's coming nice.

36:25.216 --> 36:28.252
Just looking at it in profile
here as opposed to these

36:28.286 --> 36:30.654
laying almost flat like this,

36:30.689 --> 36:33.190
if you actually raise them up
a little bit

36:33.224 --> 36:35.592
you would have
a more interesting profile.

36:35.627 --> 36:37.194
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

36:37.228 --> 36:40.197
We're thinking something
that has hatched

36:40.231 --> 36:44.068
and is now trying to camouflage
itself to its new surroundings.

36:44.102 --> 36:47.004
The skin is kind
of like the desert lizard.

36:47.038 --> 36:48.672
You might texture
this a little bit more.

36:48.707 --> 36:50.240
It's so nice and subtle,

36:50.275 --> 36:52.776
I'm afraid that once this is
all painted it's not gonna read.

36:52.811 --> 36:54.044
- Okay.
- This is the older one,

36:54.079 --> 36:56.280
so he's going to be elongated

36:56.314 --> 36:59.850
but also starting
to take on more human features.

36:59.884 --> 37:00.951
I would try to put a little

37:00.985 --> 37:03.053
- but more alien in the nose.
- Okay.

37:03.088 --> 37:05.723
As opposed
to making it too human-looking

37:05.757 --> 37:09.159
and then it makes it look like
it's a person with a mask on.

37:09.194 --> 37:10.794
Okay, let's see your last head
there.

37:10.829 --> 37:15.332
This one is the cowl
for the youngest,

37:15.367 --> 37:19.303
and so it's a little bit less
defined as the older.

37:19.337 --> 37:20.404
And you're doing that spine

37:20.438 --> 37:22.306
that you have on the back
continuing?

37:22.340 --> 37:23.540
- Yes.
- Good.

37:23.575 --> 37:25.275
We've got two aliens.

37:25.310 --> 37:27.845
There is the big
muscle-bound one,

37:27.879 --> 37:31.582
and then there's the smaller
pilot of the aircraft.

37:31.616 --> 37:33.617
Wow, very nice.

37:33.651 --> 37:35.386
And then he's gonna be covered
here with a suit?

37:35.420 --> 37:36.653
Yes, actually...

37:36.688 --> 37:38.055
Is that what you're building
over there?

37:38.089 --> 37:40.057
Yeah, I actually draped
the whole back end of the suit

37:40.091 --> 37:42.493
so it actually accents nicely
and showoff

37:42.527 --> 37:44.228
more of that muscle structure
and bone structure,

37:44.262 --> 37:45.963
so you can see the whole back
of the head.

37:45.997 --> 37:47.064
Good idea.
Good.

37:47.098 --> 37:48.599
Let's go on to the next and see.

37:48.633 --> 37:50.234
I wanted to kind
of get this down.

37:50.268 --> 37:51.502
- Right.
- He's gonna be the one

37:51.536 --> 37:54.171
taking the beating out there
in the battlefield.

37:54.205 --> 37:55.606
Aggressive, very nice.

37:55.640 --> 37:57.641
You know, one thing I think
would be an interesting thing

37:57.675 --> 37:59.843
is make some separate lips here,

37:59.878 --> 38:02.079
and use the same textures

38:02.113 --> 38:05.349
you have here
to run right into the mouth.

38:05.383 --> 38:06.950
Mm-hmm, awesome.

38:06.985 --> 38:10.020
Are there any similarities
in your two cowls?

38:10.054 --> 38:11.822
These were the similarities
right here.

38:11.856 --> 38:15.893
Since he's the bigger creature
we went with her a softer form.

38:15.927 --> 38:17.127
I would rethink the cowl

38:17.162 --> 38:19.897
just to try to pull
a little bit more of that

38:19.931 --> 38:22.199
into this or vice versa.

38:22.233 --> 38:24.168
That makes sense.

38:24.202 --> 38:25.369
Good-bye, everybody.

38:25.403 --> 38:27.704
All: Good-bye!

38:28.940 --> 38:31.341
All right,
let's talk about this fella.

38:31.376 --> 38:34.044
I think what I should do
with this, in all honesty,

38:34.078 --> 38:36.346
is cut all of this down,

38:36.381 --> 38:38.615
do almost a flat nose

38:38.650 --> 38:40.951
with nostrils...
slits, like right here.

38:40.985 --> 38:42.119
Mr. Westmore's advice

38:42.153 --> 38:44.087
just completely
changed my entire design.

38:44.122 --> 38:46.089
I mean,
I'm back to the drawing board.

38:46.124 --> 38:48.926
So I'm adding eyes
on either side of the face

38:48.960 --> 38:51.295
and rounded shapes in the nose.

38:51.329 --> 38:55.566
I'm hoping it's going
to make my makeup better.

38:55.600 --> 38:57.301
Anthony's
starting over right now,

38:57.335 --> 38:59.369
and I
think it's the right decision.

38:59.404 --> 39:02.539
The face is the most
important part of the character,

39:02.574 --> 39:04.441
and it needs to be right.

39:09.881 --> 39:11.748
Make the details
a lot more subtle.

39:11.783 --> 39:13.484
- Okay.
- All right, guys.

39:13.518 --> 39:15.986
We got to head out,
so good luck.

39:16.020 --> 39:18.055
I will be back tomorrow in
the beginning part of the day.

39:18.089 --> 39:19.857
So if you can mold,

39:19.891 --> 39:21.925
crystal clear, dulling spray,
and dust.

39:21.960 --> 39:24.261
It's time for me
to leave my team on day one,

39:24.295 --> 39:25.762
and I'm feeling pretty good,

39:25.797 --> 39:28.465
but I'm hoping some of the molds
can get done so that tomorrow

39:28.500 --> 39:30.834
we can get these characters
pre-painted.

39:30.869 --> 39:33.036
Even though we're here to coach
and guide them,

39:33.071 --> 39:36.573
ultimately they have to do
things for themselves.

39:36.608 --> 39:38.609
We're out. Bye!

39:44.883 --> 39:46.049
We're running out of time,

39:46.084 --> 39:48.385
so as soon
as Jamie's done with the face

39:48.419 --> 39:51.855
I take it into the mold room
and start molding it.

39:51.890 --> 39:53.690
It's really important
to get this face out today,

39:53.725 --> 39:57.327
because we want to be able
to have a foam latex piece

39:57.362 --> 39:58.595
to put up against the cowl

39:58.630 --> 40:01.265
and know exactly where that edge
line is so we know if we

40:01.299 --> 40:03.934
need to bring the cowl forward
or push it back any further.

40:03.968 --> 40:07.538
You know how it goes.

40:07.572 --> 40:09.039
I would just get
this done and finished,

40:09.073 --> 40:12.609
and then we can worry
about other stuff tomorrow.

40:12.644 --> 40:15.579
Yeah. What I'm doing today
is a lot of fabrication.

40:15.613 --> 40:17.614
I need to do a chest plate
for the arachnid,

40:17.649 --> 40:19.716
and I still have to work
on our invading alien.

40:19.751 --> 40:21.084
I have to work on weapons,

40:21.119 --> 40:22.986
so I wanted to get as much done
as possible.

40:23.021 --> 40:24.988
I'm gonna go on the arm
like this.

40:25.023 --> 40:26.023
Awesome.

40:29.627 --> 40:32.462
I just did them
like little pockets

40:32.497 --> 40:34.197
and then, like,
tapered them down.

40:34.232 --> 40:36.133
My face sculpt
is all blocked out.

40:36.167 --> 40:38.402
I'm starting to go
into a little bit of detail.

40:38.436 --> 40:41.271
We should definitely add,
like, the dryness...

40:41.306 --> 40:42.306
the texture to it.

40:42.340 --> 40:44.174
To, like,
at least the outer edges

40:44.208 --> 40:45.642
- on this side I think.
- Yeah.

40:45.677 --> 40:48.045
Darla's right next to me
working on the younger alien,

40:48.079 --> 40:50.380
so I'm taking Laura's advice

40:50.415 --> 40:52.716
and I'm looking back and forth
at both of them

40:52.750 --> 40:55.786
and making sure they look like
they're from the same planet.

40:55.820 --> 40:58.188
Hey, everybody, it's 30 minutes!

41:08.266 --> 41:10.500
So I have a couple more things
to do tomorrow.

41:10.535 --> 41:12.703
That's time, everybody.

41:12.737 --> 41:14.071
Wow.

41:14.105 --> 41:15.472
It's the end of the day,

41:15.506 --> 41:17.140
and I'm very happy

41:17.175 --> 41:19.943
with the way that
the new sculpture is coming out,

41:19.944 --> 41:21.912
but we have no molds done,

41:22.245 --> 41:23.876
and Rob is still working
on the fabrication.

41:24.514 --> 41:26.448
So I'm really nervous
about tomorrow

41:26.483 --> 41:28.517
because we still have a lot
of work to do.

41:28.551 --> 41:29.852
There's only two days left,

41:29.886 --> 41:32.254
and I don't know
how we're gonna get it done.

41:42.555 --> 41:43.521
Uh-oh.

41:43.556 --> 41:44.522
[Gasps]

41:44.557 --> 41:45.957
Hey, guys.

41:45.991 --> 41:48.493
Come on in and gather round.

41:48.527 --> 41:50.295
Oh, my God.

41:50.329 --> 41:51.296
Real monkeys!

41:51.330 --> 41:52.530
There's monkeys!

41:52.565 --> 41:54.199
It's crazy!

41:54.233 --> 41:57.468
Wait, where's my sculpture?

41:57.503 --> 42:00.805
I have another big surprise
for you.

42:00.839 --> 42:03.074
There's a huge piece
of information

42:03.108 --> 42:04.542
that I didn't share
with you yesterday.

42:04.577 --> 42:06.377
Oh, no.

42:06.412 --> 42:07.445
There's something happening,

42:07.479 --> 42:08.479
and I don't know what it is,

42:08.514 --> 42:10.348
but things
are about to get real.

42:10.382 --> 42:12.717
Even the coaches
don't know what's going on.

42:12.751 --> 42:14.152
This is completely crazy.

42:14.186 --> 42:18.187
Your spacecraft
didn't crash-land on Earth.

42:18.188 --> 42:20.030
- Oh, no.
- Oh.

42:20.065 --> 42:23.061
It crash-landed on a planet
controlled by primates

42:23.095 --> 42:27.131
who are not happy
to see your alien invaders.

42:27.166 --> 42:30.935
So you'll each be choosing
one of these simians

42:30.970 --> 42:35.763
as inspiration
for a third character.

42:35.798 --> 42:37.123
[Laughter]

42:37.124 --> 42:38.124
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

42:39.011 --> 42:40.278
We had a plan,

42:40.312 --> 42:43.548
and now that's out the door.

42:43.582 --> 42:46.150
I can feel the nerves
radiating off of my team.

42:46.185 --> 42:47.861
This is already
a tough challenge,

42:47.862 --> 42:50.071
and now it's gonna
get a little tougher.

42:51.513 --> 42:54.002
Everything changes,
and I'm freaking out.

42:54.003 --> 42:56.058
This competition,
it's unbelievable.

42:56.059 --> 42:57.669
We're going to be in trouble.
