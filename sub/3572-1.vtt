<i>- So, he skipped…
- Skipped from…</i>

00:52.317 --> 00:54.050
<i>No, no, no.
I'm gonna do it alone.</i>

00:54.052 --> 00:58.320
<i>So he skipped from the oven
and into bread dough,</i>

00:59.189 --> 01:02.856
All ready to rise
in the night kitchen.

01:03.859 --> 01:05.592
What time is it?

01:06.661 --> 01:09.361
It's almost 10:00. Huh.

01:09.363 --> 01:10.462
Why?

01:13.633 --> 01:17.234
After the book,
will you do my nails?

01:19.705 --> 01:22.105
You never want me
to do your nails.

01:22.107 --> 01:25.174
I know.
But I thought it'd be fun.

01:31.514 --> 01:33.947
What time is it, mom?

01:33.949 --> 01:38.617
Let's see. It's past your bedtime.
It's after 11:00.

01:38.619 --> 01:39.784
Let's make cookies.

01:41.720 --> 01:42.952
Please?

01:45.289 --> 01:47.889
You're so pretty.

01:48.625 --> 01:50.591
Thank you.

02:16.715 --> 02:20.049
Ronnie? Come in, sweetie.

02:20.051 --> 02:21.717
- I didn't want to, but she made me.
- What?

02:21.719 --> 02:23.585
I'm sorry. Please, I'm sorry.

02:23.587 --> 02:25.253
Shh. Come here. Come here.

02:25.955 --> 02:28.621
Shh. It's okay.

02:40.433 --> 02:42.266
<i>Why do I have to bring her?</i>

02:43.335 --> 02:46.369
Honey, you've played with her
since kindergarten.

02:46.371 --> 02:47.870
She's weird.

02:47.872 --> 02:50.839
Well, all the more reason
to be kind.

02:50.841 --> 02:53.308
I don't think ronnie
has any friends, sweetheart.

02:53.310 --> 02:54.909
I like ronnie.

02:54.911 --> 02:56.510
Then you hang out with her.

03:03.017 --> 03:05.484
Come on in, sweetie.
Come on in.

03:05.486 --> 03:07.085
Is this what you got
for the birthday girl?

03:07.087 --> 03:09.554
- My mom got it.
- Yeah?

03:09.556 --> 03:12.256
Boy, you're getting
lovelier every day.

03:12.258 --> 03:15.525
Look at your cute figure.

03:15.527 --> 03:16.792
I don't have a figure.

03:16.794 --> 03:18.493
Oh, but you will.

03:18.495 --> 03:22.029
And when you do,
it's going to be outrageous.

03:23.699 --> 03:26.499
Wait till you see what
alice is wearing.

03:34.741 --> 03:36.906
I didn't want to bring you.

03:39.110 --> 03:41.443
I didn't want to come.

03:54.656 --> 03:57.656
Hey, guys.
Can anyone do a cannonball?

03:59.059 --> 04:00.324
Anyone?

04:09.601 --> 04:11.166
Yay!

04:13.870 --> 04:15.336
It'll match with your suit.

04:16.238 --> 04:18.870
- So cute.
- Ooh!

04:21.808 --> 04:24.208
Oh, my god!

04:24.210 --> 04:27.110
Penelope, your mother
has such great taste.

04:27.112 --> 04:29.078
Oh, let me see that.

04:29.980 --> 04:32.914
- Who's this from?
- I wonder what it is.

04:32.916 --> 04:34.582
It's just a book.

04:34.584 --> 04:36.350
God, you just told her.

04:36.352 --> 04:38.185
Okay, we like books.

04:38.187 --> 04:41.655
- No, we don't.
- Thanks, alice.

04:41.657 --> 04:43.123
Well, you should thank my mom.

04:43.125 --> 04:44.491
She's so weird.

04:44.493 --> 04:46.259
Well… Oh, it
looks like that's it, honey.

04:46.861 --> 04:48.660
That girl has a present.

04:50.597 --> 04:52.330
No, don't give it to her.

04:53.700 --> 04:55.266
Here, mary.

05:01.539 --> 05:05.006
Thanks. She's… Cute.

05:07.310 --> 05:08.742
You're just a stupid bitch.

05:08.744 --> 05:11.244
You don't have to
pretend like you like it.

05:11.246 --> 05:14.113
Excuse me.
You don't say that word.

05:14.115 --> 05:15.614
Ronnie!

05:15.616 --> 05:17.282
Hey, I'm talking to you.

05:17.817 --> 05:19.016
Can't you hear me?

05:19.018 --> 05:20.517
- Hey…
- Oh, my god.

05:20.519 --> 05:22.185
You hit my mom!

05:22.187 --> 05:25.888
Ronnie! No.
What are you doing?

05:25.890 --> 05:28.023
I think this party
is over for you two.

05:28.025 --> 05:29.090
Why don't you get your things?

05:31.994 --> 05:33.693
Why do I have to leave?

05:35.797 --> 05:38.597
- Go.
- Why do I have to leave?

06:43.292 --> 06:44.958
Ronnie!

06:45.627 --> 06:46.859
Ronnie.

09:06.266 --> 09:08.450
<i>What everyone was doing
was just pissing me off.</i>

09:08.451 --> 09:10.635
<i>Weren't you always looking down at
other people, judging everyone but</i>

09:10.637 --> 09:11.702
<i>She literally…</i>

09:11.704 --> 09:13.737
You want some breakfast?

09:13.739 --> 09:15.705
Alice, you should
have some breakfast.

09:15.707 --> 09:17.873
What? No, thanks.

09:19.209 --> 09:22.909
Hey, just say the word
and we can paint this room.

09:22.911 --> 09:25.144
It might even be fun.

09:25.146 --> 09:29.213
I ran into ronnie fuller's
mother at the atm.

09:29.215 --> 09:30.280
She said ronnie got a job.

09:31.483 --> 09:33.249
What are you watching?

09:33.251 --> 09:35.651
That one?
She's the meanest.

09:35.653 --> 09:37.519
She thinks she's better
than everyone else.

09:37.521 --> 09:39.254
<i>- You're being ridiculous.
- I'm being ridiculous?</i>

09:39.256 --> 09:40.588
<i>Yeah, you're being ridiculous.</i>

09:40.590 --> 09:44.157
Okay, let's get this
day started, shall we?

09:45.059 --> 09:47.392
What are you gonna do today?

09:47.394 --> 09:48.993
Look for a job.

09:51.697 --> 09:54.297
- See you later.
- Bye.

09:58.068 --> 09:59.901
<i>Dear producers…</i>

09:59.903 --> 10:01.936
All the time I see
new television shows,

10:01.938 --> 10:04.305
But I like yours the best.

10:05.675 --> 10:08.509
<i>I have an idea for a show
that maybe you would like.</i>

10:08.511 --> 10:12.912
<i>About people who have been in jail or
got in trouble for doing something bad.</i>

10:12.914 --> 10:14.546
But they're actually innocent.

10:18.285 --> 10:21.986
<i>I know I don't look like
most people on tv.</i>

10:21.988 --> 10:25.523
<i>But I am on a diet
and exercising every day.</i>

10:27.393 --> 10:30.693
<i>And I think people will be
interested in my story.</i>

10:32.096 --> 10:35.230
<i>I am only 18 but I spent
a long time in jail</i>

10:35.232 --> 10:37.631
<i>For a crime I did not commit.</i>

10:40.335 --> 10:41.867
<i>If people saw me on television</i>

10:43.103 --> 10:45.503
<i>They would realize
that underneath it all</i>

10:45.505 --> 10:47.171
<i>I am just like everyone else.</i>

10:49.808 --> 10:53.976
<i>I think this show would be
educational and popular.</i>

10:53.978 --> 10:55.978
<i>And maybe it would
help everyone figure out</i>

10:55.980 --> 10:59.147
<i>The truth about what actually
happened to me.</i>

11:06.488 --> 11:08.321
Let's see.
I'll have three onion…

11:08.956 --> 11:10.688
Oh, and two rolls.

11:13.592 --> 11:14.891
You know, and since
you're about to close,

11:14.893 --> 11:16.926
Can I have 14
for the price of a dozen?

11:19.363 --> 11:21.029
Sorry. My manager says no.

11:22.332 --> 11:24.498
You're just gonna
throw them away.

11:24.500 --> 11:27.501
I come here all the time.

11:27.503 --> 11:30.103
- Sure thing. You can have 14.
- Great.

11:31.039 --> 11:33.839
So the rest will be everything.

11:37.177 --> 11:40.311
Oh, you know what?
I don't have any cash.

11:40.313 --> 11:42.546
Can I write you a check?

11:42.548 --> 11:44.848
- Certainly.
- Great.

11:49.353 --> 11:51.019
Liar.

11:51.755 --> 11:54.222
- Excuse me?
- What?

11:57.726 --> 12:02.995
You know what? I'm going to
need some cash back, too.

12:02.997 --> 12:04.863
- How much are you going to need?
- 100.

12:07.334 --> 12:09.067
Of course, ma'am.

12:12.438 --> 12:14.137
Thanks.

12:17.175 --> 12:19.542
Ronnie, you're killing me here.

12:23.247 --> 12:26.414
- You can take off.
- Thanks, clarice.

12:30.153 --> 12:34.354
Kayla.
Art is for making a mess.

12:34.356 --> 12:36.656
Don't be so scared.
Don't be so afraid.

12:36.658 --> 12:37.923
Uh-huh.

12:41.161 --> 12:45.028
Art is not for conforming.
Art is for creating, right?

12:47.999 --> 12:51.100
Uh, hey, ms. Manning. Um,
can I see you for a second?

12:51.102 --> 12:54.169
Oh, just a minute…

12:54.171 --> 12:57.705
All right, you go ahead.
I'll be right back.

12:59.508 --> 13:01.941
Kayla is afraid to draw
in a goddamn coloring book.

13:01.943 --> 13:05.777
She's afraid she's no good
if she doesn't impress you.

13:05.779 --> 13:09.547
Excuse me, mrs. West. Ah…

13:10.349 --> 13:13.049
I teach children to be original.

13:13.051 --> 13:16.552
To express themselves
uniquely, independently.

13:16.554 --> 13:18.854
She's eight. Who gives a shit?

13:20.757 --> 13:24.791
I do. I'm trying to give her
an art education.

13:24.793 --> 13:26.626
Regardless of whether
or not that is something

13:26.628 --> 13:28.761
That you can understand
or appreciate.

13:28.763 --> 13:30.896
I want what's good for my kid.

13:30.898 --> 13:33.265
And if she wants to draw
in a fucking coloring book

13:33.267 --> 13:35.800
For the rest of her life,
that's okay with me.

13:35.802 --> 13:39.736
- Please. Language…
- Well, then I feel sorry for your little girl.

13:39.738 --> 13:42.238
You feel sorry
for my little girl?

13:48.445 --> 13:50.311
So tell me a little bit
about your job searching.

13:51.047 --> 13:54.114
I tried. I looked a long time.

13:54.116 --> 13:57.617
I was at the mall,
asking in clothing stores.

13:57.619 --> 13:59.418
Those jobs are hard to get.

13:59.420 --> 14:03.221
I don't see why you don't try for
one of those fast food places.

14:03.223 --> 14:07.524
I'd rather not work in a fast
food place if I don't have to.

14:07.526 --> 14:11.460
I don't believe in what
they're doing. I don't.

14:14.164 --> 14:16.731
You won't even
eat at those places.

14:17.333 --> 14:19.199
A person has to work.

14:24.105 --> 14:26.138
So, where did you apply?

14:27.741 --> 14:30.441
Food emporium and contempo.

14:30.443 --> 14:32.443
I mean,
it's called wet seal now.

14:32.445 --> 14:35.779
Those are union.
Don't waste your time.

14:35.781 --> 14:39.382
Food emporium is, but I didn't
find that out until I got there.

14:39.384 --> 14:41.217
Not wet seal.

14:43.054 --> 14:45.754
They don't want
a girl like me anyway.

14:54.798 --> 14:56.998
Something will come through.

15:16.652 --> 15:18.852
<i>That's beautiful, honey.</i>

15:19.521 --> 15:20.920
Can I see?

15:23.024 --> 15:26.391
Who wants a sip of mine?

15:28.128 --> 15:29.227
Me.

15:32.665 --> 15:34.364
- Yum.
- Yeah?

15:34.366 --> 15:35.531
Yeah.

15:37.067 --> 15:38.800
Alice?

15:38.802 --> 15:43.137
No, thank you. It's illegal.

15:43.139 --> 15:45.738
Alice manning, the police might
come and get you if you have a sip.

15:46.974 --> 15:48.039
I'll protect you.

15:57.048 --> 16:00.883
Ronnie, this is beautiful.

16:00.885 --> 16:03.785
It's so powerful
and dark and interesting.

16:04.754 --> 16:06.720
You're really talented.
You know that?

16:06.722 --> 16:08.755
- Will you sign it for me?
- Mmm-hmm.

16:08.757 --> 16:10.223
Yeah?

16:29.174 --> 16:31.240
What about this one?

16:33.377 --> 16:34.809
Comfy.

16:34.811 --> 16:36.877
That leather one over there.
That… That's the…

16:36.879 --> 16:39.179
We are not getting
a leather couch.

16:39.181 --> 16:41.114
You ain't gonna tell me we
ain't getting a leather couch.

16:41.116 --> 16:43.216
Look at that shit.
That shit is fly.

16:46.754 --> 16:47.886
You guys getting closer?

16:47.888 --> 16:50.421
- Yes. We are.
- Not with that one, no.

16:50.423 --> 16:51.789
- I like this one.
- That's chintz.

16:51.791 --> 16:53.757
- It's our new line.
- Uh, bitch.

16:53.759 --> 16:56.693
That's bitch. That ain't chintz.

16:56.695 --> 16:59.629
- Leather, yeah, that's right.
- All right, sure.

16:59.631 --> 17:02.031
I ain't getting
no leather couch.

17:02.033 --> 17:03.399
You can give me a price on that?

17:03.401 --> 17:05.501
Devlin, I ain't
getting no leather couch.

17:05.502 --> 17:07.469
- This is how I can kick back.
- You like with the feet up?

17:07.471 --> 17:09.404
Yeah. Kick back,
watch some game and shit.

17:09.406 --> 17:11.939
I hear you. DEVLIN: This is
how we should be living, you know.

17:13.208 --> 17:14.574
Brittany?

17:16.978 --> 17:19.444
Hey, baby,
where did brittany go?

17:22.048 --> 17:24.080
Brittany?

17:24.083 --> 17:25.781
She's probably
jumping on some bed somewhere,

17:25.784 --> 17:28.451
Doing something
she ain't supposed to.

17:28.453 --> 17:30.753
Brittany.

17:32.356 --> 17:36.791
Brittany? Answer me.

17:38.094 --> 17:39.760
Devlin, help me.

17:43.065 --> 17:44.497
Brit. Brit. Brit.

17:44.499 --> 17:47.032
Hold on. Hold on one second. My daughter…
My daughter ran…

17:47.034 --> 17:48.333
- Maveen…
- All right.

17:48.335 --> 17:49.467
- Brit?
- Ma'am,

17:49.469 --> 17:50.868
- Is there something…
- Have you seen a little girl?

17:50.870 --> 17:53.003
She's just three years old.
She runs off sometimes

17:53.005 --> 17:54.472
But never for this long.

17:54.474 --> 17:56.574
Um, she's not answering me.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.075
Brit, I know you hear me.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.544
Don't you worry. Let's look.

18:00.546 --> 18:01.912
- Brittany.
- Now, brit, you're gonna be in trouble

18:01.914 --> 18:03.046
If you don't come out.

18:03.048 --> 18:04.680
Brittany, don't hide from mommy!

18:05.749 --> 18:07.315
No one left the store.

18:07.317 --> 18:09.984
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

18:09.986 --> 18:11.251
Calm down.
She's just hiding from us.

18:11.253 --> 18:12.919
- Brittany!
- It's okay. It's okay.

18:12.921 --> 18:15.788
Brittany, I know you hear me.
Come out, girl.

18:15.790 --> 18:16.855
Shit!

18:16.857 --> 18:19.390
- Brittany!
- Brittany? Fuck.

18:24.896 --> 18:26.462
I'm sorry I'm late.

18:26.464 --> 18:28.664
I had to take my mom to the
doctor and it took forever.

18:28.666 --> 18:30.298
I thought you didn't drive.

18:30.300 --> 18:31.999
We took the bus.

18:33.068 --> 18:35.601
She wanted my company.

18:35.603 --> 18:37.135
Why couldn't your dad take her?

18:44.844 --> 18:46.310
You got some of that red bull?

18:46.779 --> 18:48.245
Uh, yeah, I can.

18:50.115 --> 18:52.281
My dad's truck is full of them.
He'll never notice.

18:52.916 --> 18:54.081
Thanks.

18:57.453 --> 18:59.553
- How's she doing?
- Huh?

18:59.555 --> 19:02.254
- Your mom.
- Oh, uh, not good.

19:48.132 --> 19:50.765
You're going
to find my baby, right?

19:50.767 --> 19:52.466
We'll find her.

19:52.468 --> 19:55.068
You have my word on that, okay?

19:55.070 --> 19:56.602
You got kids?

19:57.538 --> 20:01.172
Two daughters.
Thirteen, three months.

20:06.078 --> 20:09.045
I only turned around
for a minute, I swear.

20:10.048 --> 20:11.614
A minute is a long time.

20:11.616 --> 20:16.285
I didn't think. There were people around.
It was a nice store.

20:16.287 --> 20:20.255
She always running off
when she sees something she like.

20:20.257 --> 20:22.523
Wanting us to buy it for her.

20:27.162 --> 20:28.261
And you are…

20:30.765 --> 20:32.698
- This your husband?
- Boyfriend.

20:33.467 --> 20:34.865
Of course.

20:37.402 --> 20:40.136
You the baby daddy?

20:40.138 --> 20:44.140
She calls him daddy.
He's here. Her daddy ain't.

20:44.142 --> 20:46.308
- And the biological father?
- I don't know.

20:47.144 --> 20:49.644
I don't care
and neither does he.

20:52.815 --> 20:54.881
You got a job, boyfriend?

20:56.017 --> 20:57.249
Or you just chilling?

20:57.251 --> 20:59.284
Why are you asking him
these questions?

20:59.286 --> 21:00.485
I know why he's
asking these questions.

21:00.487 --> 21:02.220
Where were you when
brittany went missing?

21:02.222 --> 21:04.188
- He was with me.
- I'm not asking you.

21:04.957 --> 21:06.556
I'm asking him.

21:07.525 --> 21:10.792
Where were you
when brittany went missing?

21:12.228 --> 21:13.594
Want me to ask you again?

21:13.596 --> 21:16.063
Nigger, do your job
and find our little girl.

21:20.001 --> 21:22.167
You come here to harass me?

21:24.738 --> 21:26.304
Are you gonna
answer my question?

21:26.306 --> 21:28.306
- Do your motherfucking job…
- Where were you when brittany went missing?

21:28.308 --> 21:29.640
I'm only gonna ask you once…

21:29.642 --> 21:31.975
- I'm only gonna ask you once.
- No, man, you ain't gonna

21:31.977 --> 21:33.676
Ask me no questions like that.

21:33.678 --> 21:35.644
Where were you when
brittany went missing?

21:35.646 --> 21:36.945
Why don't you do your job?

21:36.947 --> 21:38.913
- You didn't answer my question.
- Okay.

21:38.915 --> 21:40.347
Are you gonna do your job?

21:40.349 --> 21:43.783
That's what
we're trying to do. Mister…

21:45.787 --> 21:47.019
Smith.

21:47.721 --> 21:50.721
Mr. Smith.

21:52.524 --> 21:54.824
We want to find your daughter.

21:55.526 --> 21:56.758
Okay?

21:57.193 --> 21:58.425
Yeah.

22:00.228 --> 22:02.260
What the hell was that?

22:04.664 --> 22:05.729
Huh, jones?

22:07.332 --> 22:10.499
You know even good parents
can lose their kids.

22:14.171 --> 22:16.571
They aren't good parents.

22:45.499 --> 22:47.398
You said you'd be
home for dinner.

22:47.400 --> 22:50.334
- I am home.
- It's after 8:00.

22:50.336 --> 22:53.170
- Where have you been?
- I was walking.

22:53.172 --> 22:54.337
Oh…

22:56.374 --> 22:59.274
- I'm starving.
- I didn't wait for you.

22:59.276 --> 23:01.743
That's okay.

23:02.612 --> 23:04.745
What's in there?

23:04.747 --> 23:07.214
A bunch of stuff.
Olives. Cheese.

23:07.783 --> 23:09.682
- I hate olives.
- Aw…

23:11.152 --> 23:12.985
What's this?

23:12.987 --> 23:16.355
That's a walnut. Surely
you've seen a walnut, alice.

23:16.357 --> 23:18.557
- Sorry.
- Huh?

23:18.558 --> 23:20.758
Sometimes I just think you
were switched at the hospital.

23:23.897 --> 23:27.765
You know, my horoscope today said
that all eyes would be on me.

23:27.767 --> 23:31.034
And then I'll find something
I misplaced.

23:31.036 --> 23:34.370
Did you find a job?

23:34.372 --> 23:36.405
- Not yet.
- Hmm.

23:37.408 --> 23:39.741
Did you find a boyfriend?

23:39.743 --> 23:41.809
What? Excuse me?

23:41.811 --> 23:43.544
You were reading the personals.

23:43.546 --> 23:45.979
Well, they're hilarious.

23:45.981 --> 23:49.782
And tragic. Why don't you
take a look at the want ads?

23:51.252 --> 23:54.553
Why don't you have
a boyfriend, mom?

23:54.555 --> 23:58.189
I mean, I would have figured
you'd found somebody by now.

24:04.096 --> 24:06.262
- Jones.
- How is my brother?

24:09.800 --> 24:12.033
- There's no way. You should not wait up.
- Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm.

24:12.035 --> 24:15.535
And don't watch crap tv
and fall asleep on the couch.

24:16.738 --> 24:18.337
All right.

24:18.339 --> 24:21.039
Hey. They found
something at the mall.

24:21.775 --> 24:23.207
- I got to go.
- Come on.

24:23.209 --> 24:24.508
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

24:24.510 --> 24:26.109
Do not wait up.

24:29.347 --> 24:31.013
Right over here.

24:35.619 --> 24:38.486
100 yards
from the furniture store.

24:42.225 --> 24:44.158
Some photos have been taken?

24:44.160 --> 24:45.992
Pictures all around.

24:48.763 --> 24:51.764
- I want a full dust.
- Mmm-hmm.

24:58.205 --> 24:59.904
We got blood.

25:02.108 --> 25:05.808
We're gonna need this
place wiped. Okay?

25:08.679 --> 25:09.744
Just bag it.

25:57.691 --> 25:59.357
I need a minute.

26:42.867 --> 26:45.267
You should come to bed.

26:45.269 --> 26:47.102
It's 4:00 a.M., nance.

26:50.173 --> 26:53.774
Which means it's
16 and a half hours

26:53.776 --> 26:57.878
Since a three-year-old
went missing.

26:57.880 --> 27:01.313
Wait. Missing kid. You don't
do missing kid cases.

27:03.984 --> 27:06.184
I thought I could handle it.

27:26.605 --> 27:28.137
<i>It's like a fort.</i>

27:28.139 --> 27:30.606
In high school, everybody came
up here to smoke cigarettes.

27:30.608 --> 27:32.808
I don't remember it
being this far.

27:32.810 --> 27:35.010
You smoked cigarettes?

27:35.012 --> 27:36.745
I was the lookout.

27:43.185 --> 27:44.851
It's up here.

27:46.387 --> 27:48.120
This is not part
of the grid, porter.

27:48.122 --> 27:51.489
If we find this baby first,
where does that put us?

27:52.492 --> 27:54.291
You got to follow
chain of command.

27:54.293 --> 27:56.026
See down in there?

28:03.902 --> 28:05.201
Come on.

28:09.006 --> 28:11.573
See? In here.

29:20.934 --> 29:22.166
Nance?

29:48.927 --> 29:51.193
<i>Ros, you haven't
eaten your breakfast.</i>

29:51.195 --> 29:53.828
Come on.

29:53.830 --> 29:56.030
<i>I don't have any words.</i>

29:56.032 --> 29:59.400
<i>Um, we were just shopping
for a new sofa.</i>

29:59.402 --> 30:02.436
<i>Like a second, I turned around
and then she was just like…</i>

30:02.438 --> 30:04.905
Hey, babe. How are ya?
Good morning.

30:05.540 --> 30:07.273
Daddy!

30:10.578 --> 30:12.177
Look, mama. Me.

30:13.713 --> 30:15.145
Oh, honey, that's not you.

30:21.886 --> 30:24.218
Let's turn this off right now.

30:36.062 --> 30:38.962
The birth father was in ossining
when it happened. It wasn't him.

30:38.964 --> 30:41.764
B&e. Ten years,
possibility of parole.

30:42.967 --> 30:45.334
Went back to paradise furniture,
talked to the manager.

30:45.336 --> 30:47.703
- And?
- There's nothing new.

30:47.705 --> 30:49.771
But he did say that
the boyfriend, devlin smith,

30:49.773 --> 30:54.008
Was acting…
"like an asshole."

30:55.511 --> 30:57.344
His words, not mine.

31:04.919 --> 31:07.219
Jesus, what is she doing here?

31:08.555 --> 31:10.021
Who's that?

31:10.890 --> 31:13.156
They're home, you know.

31:13.158 --> 31:15.258
They've been home for two weeks.

31:15.260 --> 31:18.027
They're back, living not even three
miles from where this happened.

31:18.029 --> 31:20.262
Who? Who's home?

31:20.264 --> 31:22.664
Ronnie fuller and alice manning.

31:24.801 --> 31:27.034
That little girl has only been
missing one night.

31:27.036 --> 31:29.269
It's possible she's still okay.

31:29.271 --> 31:32.205
These disappearances,
they're very different.

31:32.207 --> 31:35.408
Your daughter was an infant.
This girl is a toddler.

31:35.410 --> 31:38.978
Your baby was taken on impulse
and this, this seems to be…

31:38.980 --> 31:41.013
She is a 3-year-old
bi-racial child

31:41.015 --> 31:43.315
With short, curly black hair.

31:43.317 --> 31:46.151
Brittany lyttle is, in fact,
a dead ringer for my daughter,

31:46.153 --> 31:48.419
And maybe she wouldn't be
sitting here right now

31:48.421 --> 31:50.654
If these girls were smarter.

31:50.656 --> 31:51.788
Have they contacted you?

31:51.790 --> 31:53.389
Have they threatened
your family in any way?

31:53.391 --> 31:56.358
They've taken a child,
thinking it's mine.

31:56.360 --> 31:58.693
Why are you still sitting here
asking me questions?

31:58.695 --> 32:02.496
Mrs. Barnes, we,
we understand your concerns.

32:02.498 --> 32:03.630
And they'll be taken
very seriously.

32:07.836 --> 32:09.802
I won't hold my breath.

32:16.242 --> 32:17.874
Why didn't I know
about this connection?

32:17.876 --> 32:19.542
What connection?

32:20.411 --> 32:22.978
She wants it to be them.
Doesn't mean it is.

32:23.947 --> 32:25.546
Okay. Are we gonna
follow it up?

32:39.227 --> 32:40.492
Brother.

32:43.697 --> 32:44.862
Dave!

32:48.800 --> 32:51.033
Dave fuller?

32:51.035 --> 32:52.934
Why is it so obvious
you're cops?

32:55.505 --> 32:57.505
If I didn't know better, I'd think
you were boosting merchandise

32:57.507 --> 32:58.839
Off that work truck.

33:01.310 --> 33:04.044
Relax, we're not here
to bust your balls.

33:04.046 --> 33:06.246
Want to talk
to your daughter, ronnie.

33:06.248 --> 33:08.548
Why…
What'd she do this time?

33:08.550 --> 33:10.516
She didn't do nothing.

33:10.518 --> 33:12.351
Shut up.

33:12.353 --> 33:15.387
You know
where we might find her?

33:15.389 --> 33:19.657
Uh, she's working at the…
This bagel place.

33:20.426 --> 33:22.091
Out by the mall?

33:26.596 --> 33:29.396
Hi, there.
Can I help you with something?

33:31.433 --> 33:32.998
Ronnie fuller.

33:34.901 --> 33:36.467
Yeah.

33:36.469 --> 33:39.770
I'm detective porter.
This is detective jones.

33:39.772 --> 33:41.271
Is something wrong?

33:41.273 --> 33:44.207
We'd like to ask you
a few questions.

33:44.209 --> 33:48.277
- Okay. I'll meet you out front.
- Okay.

33:52.716 --> 33:54.749
Is everything all right?

33:55.852 --> 33:58.152
Was she working on monday?

33:58.154 --> 34:00.387
Yeah. She works every day.

34:01.923 --> 34:04.390
When's her shift start?

34:04.392 --> 34:07.292
It depends on the day.

34:07.294 --> 34:09.927
Most of the time, mid-morning.

34:15.967 --> 34:18.033
Shit!

34:33.349 --> 34:34.648
Hmm.

34:35.684 --> 34:37.283
Looks like we got our
first suspect.

34:37.284 --> 34:38.350
Goddamn it.

34:40.821 --> 34:43.087
- Who is it?
- Metro police.

34:46.292 --> 34:48.592
- Helen manning?
- Yeah.

34:48.594 --> 34:50.694
I'm detective jones,
detective porter.

34:51.763 --> 34:53.195
May we come in?

34:53.197 --> 34:54.529
Why do you need to come in?

34:54.531 --> 34:55.596
We're looking for your daughter.

34:56.197 --> 34:58.398
Alice. Alice manning.

34:59.334 --> 35:01.267
Well, alice isn't here.

35:02.036 --> 35:03.268
Alice!

35:05.038 --> 35:06.470
Nope.

35:06.472 --> 35:08.672
Do you have any idea
where we might find her?

35:08.674 --> 35:11.707
She's 18. I don't always know
where she goes.

35:12.443 --> 35:14.609
She's probably out walking.

35:14.611 --> 35:18.012
- Walking.
- Hmm. She walks a lot.

35:18.014 --> 35:20.547
You just have her call us
when she gets in.

35:20.549 --> 35:23.783
- Thank you very much.
- I will pass the message on.

35:23.785 --> 35:26.185
Mrs. Manning.

35:26.187 --> 35:28.654
Uh, do you know what time
she got back last night?

35:28.656 --> 35:30.022
Late.

35:30.024 --> 35:32.958
We were supposed to have dinner
together but she showed up late.

35:32.960 --> 35:34.559
- Out walking.
- Mmm.

35:34.561 --> 35:36.861
- Mmm-hmm.
- Thank you for your time.

35:41.400 --> 35:43.333
<i>One william four five.</i>

35:44.836 --> 35:46.235
Ten three, it's porter.

35:46.237 --> 35:48.470
<i>We checked in with
ronnie fuller's parents.</i>

35:48.472 --> 35:50.438
<i>There's no sign of her since she
left for work this morning.</i>

35:52.508 --> 35:53.840
Thanks.

35:55.276 --> 35:56.875
Okay.

36:11.157 --> 36:12.756
Where were you?

36:13.191 --> 36:14.490
Walking.

36:18.495 --> 36:21.162
Two detectives
came by here today.

36:21.164 --> 36:22.830
Looking for you.

36:24.767 --> 36:28.535
Alice, please tell me you
didn't do anything this time.

36:30.972 --> 36:33.339
I didn't do anything last time.

36:37.511 --> 36:39.210
Can you prove it?

36:43.482 --> 36:45.415
Let's go talk to them.

36:58.329 --> 37:00.962
You know why we wanted to
talk to you today?

37:00.964 --> 37:02.763
Because of my past.

37:04.833 --> 37:08.700
Why don't you tell me
where you were yesterday.

37:08.702 --> 37:10.902
- Well, I was walking.
- Mmm-hmm.

37:10.904 --> 37:12.536
I'm trying to lose
a little weight.

37:12.538 --> 37:14.804
Walking where?
For how long?

37:14.806 --> 37:19.341
I started out on main street and I
put in an application at arby's.

37:19.343 --> 37:21.309
I don't want to work there but

37:21.311 --> 37:23.878
My mom said that
I can't afford to be picky.

37:23.880 --> 37:25.179
It's not so bad.

37:26.248 --> 37:28.948
I did it myself.

37:28.950 --> 37:30.949
You don't look like you had to
work in a place like that.

37:32.519 --> 37:34.385
You could be a model.

37:36.622 --> 37:40.423
So, if we go to arby's they'll
be a record of your application?

37:40.425 --> 37:45.160
I guess so. I mean, the girl who took
it seemed a little spacey but…

37:45.162 --> 37:46.928
Arby's. That's near, uh…

37:46.930 --> 37:48.796
Paradise furniture.

37:48.798 --> 37:50.597
Paradise furniture?

37:51.700 --> 37:55.068
There's a little girl missing
from paradise furniture.

37:55.070 --> 38:00.006
Oh, I know. My mom told me.
I saw it on the news.

38:06.714 --> 38:10.649
You know anything at all
about this missing child?

38:21.160 --> 38:24.060
I know something
I'm not supposed to know.

38:24.829 --> 38:27.429
- Because I broke a rule.
- What rule?

38:30.834 --> 38:33.267
When I was little,
I used to go to the pharmacy

38:33.269 --> 38:36.270
And get these
chocolate covered peanuts.

38:36.272 --> 38:39.706
<i>But when I got out of sheckter,
the pharmacy was gone, so</i>

38:39.708 --> 38:42.492
<i>I've been trying to find ones</i>

38:42.493 --> 38:45.277
<i>That are as good or maybe even the
same kind, but I haven't yet.</i>

38:48.148 --> 38:52.449
<i>Anyway, I left because
I didn't want her to see me.</i>

38:53.819 --> 38:54.984
<i>Who?</i>

38:56.220 --> 38:58.720
<i>Ronnie fuller.</i>

38:58.722 --> 39:01.755
<i>I saw her standing outside
of cino's bagels.</i>

39:03.992 --> 39:06.125
<i>She seemed really nervous.</i>

39:07.561 --> 39:09.127
And she kept looking
around her like she was afraid

39:09.129 --> 39:11.395
Someone was watching her.

39:14.700 --> 39:15.832
<i>Well, alice…</i>

39:16.701 --> 39:18.701
You were watching her.

39:18.703 --> 39:22.705
Yeah, but, she didn't know that.

39:22.707 --> 39:26.141
I just thought that if I told you where
she worked that would be helpful.

39:31.647 --> 39:34.014
Do you know anything
about brittany lyttle?

39:35.484 --> 39:38.184
The three year old
that's missing.

39:38.186 --> 39:40.953
I was hoping you could
provide insight.

39:42.089 --> 39:45.223
When olivia barnes went missing,

39:45.225 --> 39:47.158
What was going
through your mind?

39:47.160 --> 39:48.225
What were you
and ronnie thinking

39:48.227 --> 39:51.228
When you and ronnie
took her from her house?

39:55.600 --> 39:58.000
How would that give you insight?

39:59.103 --> 40:02.304
I mean, unless I did
what happened now.

40:03.807 --> 40:05.907
You could help me understand
the mind of a person

40:05.909 --> 40:07.975
Who could take a child.

40:09.011 --> 40:10.944
That could help me
solve this case.

40:10.946 --> 40:12.879
You could help me.

40:13.715 --> 40:15.047
You and ronnie were friends.

40:15.049 --> 40:18.216
You were at a birthday party
having fun, right?

40:22.254 --> 40:24.320
Walk me through that day.

40:28.892 --> 40:31.192
Ronnie, ronnie.
What are you doing?

40:31.194 --> 40:32.426
Hello?

40:35.297 --> 40:36.929
- Hello?
- Ronnie!

40:54.580 --> 40:57.046
I told ronnie
we should leave it.

40:58.816 --> 41:00.916
Ronnie, what are you doing?

41:02.252 --> 41:05.119
Why are you not listening to me?

41:05.121 --> 41:06.353
Are you crazy?

41:16.364 --> 41:18.463
You're in so much trouble!

41:20.099 --> 41:21.832
She's my baby now.

41:22.801 --> 41:25.001
She needs me.

41:25.003 --> 41:28.170
No, she doesn't.
She needs her mother.

41:28.172 --> 41:30.738
Her mother doesn't love her.

41:33.409 --> 41:34.508
I do.

41:38.680 --> 41:40.179
I didn't even want it.

41:41.448 --> 41:42.847
And I didn't kill it.

41:44.917 --> 41:46.416
<i>Ronnie did.</i>

41:47.819 --> 41:50.019
<i>I don't know why she did it.</i>

41:51.322 --> 41:53.989
<i>I wasn't even there
when it happened.</i>

41:55.058 --> 41:56.890
I wasn't even there.

41:59.027 --> 42:00.493
<i>Maybe if I'd been there,</i>

42:01.562 --> 42:03.028
<i>I could have stopped her.</i>

42:04.765 --> 42:09.100
But I wasn't.
I wasn't even there.

42:13.206 --> 42:16.607
You went to juvenile hall for the
same crime as ronnie fuller.

42:16.609 --> 42:19.942
That's right.
And it wasn't fair.

42:21.078 --> 42:22.410
Just because she's
skinny and pretty

42:22.412 --> 42:25.079
It doesn't mean
that she's not bad.

42:25.081 --> 42:27.514
But you won't believe me.

42:27.516 --> 42:30.650
Because no one ever believes
the fat girl.

42:30.652 --> 42:32.852
Especially someone like you.

42:37.658 --> 42:40.058
If ronnie wanted to run away,
hide somewhere,

42:40.060 --> 42:41.526
Where would she go?

42:43.630 --> 42:47.465
I don't know. I haven't even
talked to her for seven years.

42:47.467 --> 42:49.033
Where were you last night, alice?

42:50.136 --> 42:51.668
Excuse me.

42:51.670 --> 42:52.835
I'd like to take alice home.
Now.

42:52.837 --> 42:54.270
Where were you
last night, alice?

42:54.639 --> 42:55.804
She was with me.

42:55.806 --> 42:58.206
You said she got home late.

42:58.208 --> 43:01.342
What do you consider
to be late, detective? Alice.

43:01.344 --> 43:03.777
Before you go, there's one
last thing you can do.

43:03.779 --> 43:05.912
Because I know
you want to be helpful.

43:05.914 --> 43:07.580
We just need a sample
of your blood.

43:07.582 --> 43:09.048
Why?

43:09.050 --> 43:11.517
I want to rule you
out as a suspect.

43:11.519 --> 43:13.819
You don't need
your mom's consent.

43:13.821 --> 43:14.986
You're 18 now, alice.

43:17.056 --> 43:18.288
Come on, alice.
Let's go home.

43:18.290 --> 43:20.690
You can really help us.

43:22.060 --> 43:25.127
Come on, alice. We're going home.
Now. Let's go.

43:37.807 --> 43:39.606
Do you believe her?

43:40.275 --> 43:42.108
I don't know.

44:16.643 --> 44:18.808
<i>I wasn't even there.</i>

44:20.812 --> 44:22.645
<i>I wasn't even there.</i>

44:33.390 --> 44:35.623
Where are you going?

44:35.625 --> 44:37.191
I got to work.

44:38.260 --> 44:40.260
It's late, nance.
Come to bed, please.

44:40.262 --> 44:41.894
You can take care of it
in the morning.

44:41.896 --> 44:44.529
It's a missing kid,
paul. Jesus.

44:46.833 --> 44:49.099
I don't want to go through
this shit again, nance.

45:59.268 --> 46:01.368
Are you gonna cuff me?

46:21.754 --> 46:23.720
Where's brittany lyttle?

46:23.722 --> 46:24.887
Who?

46:26.423 --> 46:29.656
The girl that was taken
from paradise furniture.

46:30.959 --> 46:32.458
There was a girl taken from
paradise furniture?

46:32.460 --> 46:35.461
Oh, come on, ronnie.

46:35.463 --> 46:37.062
If you didn't know
a girl was missing,

46:37.064 --> 46:38.830
Why did you run away?

46:38.832 --> 46:40.698
I knew you were cops.

46:41.500 --> 46:44.100
You're the cop…

46:44.869 --> 46:46.668
Who found the baby.

46:49.072 --> 46:51.238
Your hair is the same.

46:51.240 --> 46:53.373
How did you know
what I looked like?

46:53.375 --> 46:55.408
I saw you on television.

46:56.577 --> 46:58.677
Getting some kind of reward.

46:58.679 --> 47:00.011
An award.

47:02.281 --> 47:05.949
It wasn't a reward.
It was just…

47:05.951 --> 47:08.183
I just got promoted.

47:10.754 --> 47:12.854
For finding olivia barnes?

47:16.325 --> 47:17.490
Yeah.

47:25.565 --> 47:28.332
Why did you take
olivia barnes, ronnie?

47:33.938 --> 47:38.506
<i>She was crying. I couldn't
leave her like that.</i>

47:39.275 --> 47:41.174
Ronnie!

47:48.082 --> 47:49.581
You're in so much trouble.

47:52.986 --> 47:54.485
She's my baby now.

47:58.957 --> 48:00.790
She is kind of cute.

48:05.396 --> 48:07.062
Hi, baby.

48:08.432 --> 48:11.399
All right. We can keep her.

48:28.050 --> 48:29.883
Can I hold her now?

48:30.719 --> 48:33.319
She likes to be bounced.

48:33.321 --> 48:36.888
It calms her.
I know about babies.

48:36.890 --> 48:38.723
My mom's a teacher.

48:39.492 --> 48:42.159
When do I get to hold her?

48:42.161 --> 48:44.761
She doesn't like to be
passed around.

48:44.763 --> 48:47.763
That's right, little girl.
Mommy's here.

48:48.899 --> 48:51.532
Daddy's going to get you
some food.

48:51.534 --> 48:54.468
Just the pudding.
That's all I can get.

48:54.470 --> 48:56.536
Go make her a bed.

49:10.718 --> 49:12.851
Are you sure we can leave her?

49:13.753 --> 49:15.619
We have to go home.

49:20.592 --> 49:22.625
- We'll be back tomorrow.
- We promise.

49:32.768 --> 49:33.833
So alice lied.

49:36.237 --> 49:37.802
She was there.

49:40.706 --> 49:43.406
Let me ask you something.

49:43.908 --> 49:45.440
Why pudding?

49:46.776 --> 49:49.243
I could never figure that out.

49:49.245 --> 49:52.312
If you could buy pudding,
you could buy baby food.

49:52.314 --> 49:54.380
We couldn't buy anything.

49:55.916 --> 49:59.617
I just took those from my dad's truck.
It was full of them.

50:01.854 --> 50:04.821
<i>They made her sick, though,
I'm pretty sure.</i>

50:04.823 --> 50:08.157
What's wrong with her?

50:08.159 --> 50:10.025
Why won't she eat it?

50:12.396 --> 50:15.063
- It's pudding.
- She can't take bites.

50:18.234 --> 50:21.034
See, it's just getting
all over her mouth.

50:21.036 --> 50:23.169
Eat the pudding, please. Eat the pudding.

50:23.171 --> 50:25.471
- Please.
- What do we do, ronnie?

50:25.473 --> 50:27.306
Eat the pudding.

50:27.308 --> 50:30.642
<i>Why didn't you
take her to a doctor?</i>

50:30.644 --> 50:33.143
We knew we would
get into trouble.

50:35.480 --> 50:39.181
We saw the stuff on the news
about her being missing and…

50:39.183 --> 50:43.217
Alice said that bringing her
back would only make it worse.

50:44.787 --> 50:47.187
That's why you did what you did?

50:48.490 --> 50:52.291
<i>Alice said she'd put all
the blame on me if I didn't.</i>

50:53.927 --> 50:56.694
I think she's really sick.

50:58.597 --> 51:00.430
Maybe dying.

51:01.933 --> 51:04.199
We should just take her back.

51:05.435 --> 51:08.903
Or call someone and tell them
where she is.

51:08.905 --> 51:12.839
You can't call someone.
They'll take you to jail.

51:13.808 --> 51:16.708
You did this, ronnie. Not me.

51:26.352 --> 51:29.653
Alice's mom was my friend.
Not alice.

51:33.424 --> 51:35.290
She didn't like that.

51:47.204 --> 51:50.138
- Can I ask you one more thing?
- Okay.

51:53.910 --> 51:56.510
How'd the jack-in-the-box
get there?

52:01.349 --> 52:02.948
I put it there.

52:39.919 --> 52:41.118
<i>Ronnie.</i>

52:42.421 --> 52:43.686
Ronnie.

52:54.498 --> 52:56.964
I think she was
glad to be found.

52:59.368 --> 53:01.534
Something's not right here.

53:06.873 --> 53:08.138
We need to get their files.

53:08.140 --> 53:10.807
See what happened
when they were away.

53:20.385 --> 53:22.184
Now, you go make some more,
make some more,

53:22.186 --> 53:24.786
- And I'll feed you when you make it, okay?
- Okay.

53:24.788 --> 53:27.188
I'll be over there in a second.

53:30.693 --> 53:32.926
- Are you comfortable?
- Yeah.

53:34.062 --> 53:36.461
You know that couch is real old.

53:39.232 --> 53:42.399
We were shopping for a new one
when it happened.

53:42.401 --> 53:44.467
You can't blame yourself.

53:45.970 --> 53:47.635
- How can you not?
- I don't know.

53:50.239 --> 53:51.771
My daughter was
with her babysitter.

53:53.040 --> 53:54.672
Then it wasn't your fault.

53:54.674 --> 53:57.374
- If I hadn't been working.
- Well, you had to work.

53:57.376 --> 54:02.311
No, not really. I chose to.

54:03.447 --> 54:05.780
Well,

54:05.782 --> 54:09.984
I told the police I only
looked away for a second.

54:09.986 --> 54:13.253
But it was longer.

54:13.255 --> 54:15.221
It was a lot longer
than a second.

54:15.223 --> 54:17.189
This is not your fault.

54:18.392 --> 54:21.993
We just… We never think
that this will happen to us.

54:30.202 --> 54:31.668
You from tv?

54:32.704 --> 54:34.503
I'm visiting.

54:34.505 --> 54:36.938
Cynthia here lost a child.

54:36.940 --> 54:39.640
She came here
for a visit to help me.

54:41.577 --> 54:44.744
- Is your child still lost?
- Devlin…

54:44.746 --> 54:47.313
I just asked if her child lost,
how's she gonna help us.

54:47.848 --> 54:49.814
My first child is dead.

54:52.118 --> 54:56.887
So how's that supposed to make
maveen feel better? Huh?

55:06.264 --> 55:08.963
I'm sorry.

55:10.166 --> 55:12.432
I'm sorry.

55:12.434 --> 55:14.801
Come on, rosalind. Let's go,
come on, ros, toy down.

55:14.803 --> 55:16.602
Let's go, it's time to go.

55:16.604 --> 55:19.104
Put the toy down. Let's go.
Come on.

55:19.106 --> 55:21.506
Let's clean up.

55:21.508 --> 55:24.842
My bad. I…
I didn't mean it like that.

55:27.279 --> 55:29.312
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.

55:34.885 --> 55:37.852
She can't take that toy.
That's brittany's.

55:43.993 --> 55:45.225
Sorry.

55:46.194 --> 55:47.793
Okay, let's go.

56:04.143 --> 56:06.309
You always sleep like that?

56:07.879 --> 56:11.380
Some things are easier
if you can sleep through them.

56:17.620 --> 56:20.954
Can I go now? You said
I wasn't under arrest.

56:25.659 --> 56:27.058
You're up.

56:27.627 --> 56:28.792
Yeah.

56:35.799 --> 56:37.865
Have you seen this little girl?

56:44.139 --> 56:45.571
She's cute.

56:47.241 --> 56:49.107
She looks like alice.

56:50.643 --> 56:51.708
Like alice?

56:54.079 --> 56:56.813
How? How does
a bi-racial three-year-old

56:56.815 --> 56:58.080
With dark hair
look like alice manning?

56:58.082 --> 57:00.649
I don't know.
I don't know why I said that.

57:00.651 --> 57:01.716
It just popped out.

57:01.718 --> 57:03.784
When was the last time
you saw her, ronnie?

57:04.553 --> 57:06.686
- Alice.
- I don't see alice.

57:09.390 --> 57:11.723
If you want to
rule yourself out then,

57:11.725 --> 57:13.124
Maybe you can
give us a blood sample.

57:16.395 --> 57:19.229
You want me to give you
my blood.

57:19.231 --> 57:22.265
If you didn't do it,
you can prove it.

57:22.267 --> 57:25.734
- No.
- Then you can go. It's simple. We just prick your finger.

57:25.736 --> 57:27.001
No. No.

57:29.505 --> 57:30.670
Ronnie.

57:32.340 --> 57:34.306
Help us. Help yourself.

57:37.644 --> 57:39.243
Nobody cuts me.

57:50.455 --> 57:53.088
Yes, ma'am, what I need you to understand
is that we need those files here.

57:53.090 --> 57:55.590
Today. Yeah, hold on.

57:55.592 --> 57:58.492
All the files from county
were sent upstate.

57:58.494 --> 58:00.093
What? Why?

58:00.095 --> 58:02.361
Apparently they ran out of room.

58:02.363 --> 58:04.596
Just get them.
Tell them. Get them.

58:04.598 --> 58:06.731
They're saying they're like
20 years' worth of files.

58:06.733 --> 58:08.365
They can get someone
to help us with them,

58:08.367 --> 58:11.067
But they're not guaranteeing
they'll be complete.

58:14.405 --> 58:16.438
This is detective nancy porter.

58:16.440 --> 58:17.739
Let me be clear.

58:17.741 --> 58:21.942
A child is missing. A three-year-old.
For two days.

58:21.944 --> 58:23.710
And I want to find her
while she's still alive

58:23.712 --> 58:25.011
And you are going to help me.

58:25.013 --> 58:26.479
You are going
to find your files.

58:26.481 --> 58:28.614
And when you send them,
they will be complete.

58:28.616 --> 58:30.215
Do your job.

58:32.152 --> 58:33.251
Hmm.

59:16.091 --> 59:19.692
<i>My mom always says
never give up.</i>

59:19.694 --> 59:22.861
<i>But it feels like
she's given up on me.</i>

59:22.863 --> 59:24.462
<i>Sometimes I wonder,</i>

59:24.464 --> 59:27.331
<i>What did I do to make her
not like me?</i>

59:30.369 --> 59:33.069
<i>Maybe it's my dad.</i>

59:33.071 --> 59:36.305
<i>She says he was the biggest
mistake of her life.</i>

59:39.376 --> 59:41.442
<i>She says he was fat, too.</i>

59:43.580 --> 59:46.147
<i>When she looks at me,
does she see him?</i>

59:50.052 --> 59:51.351
<i>When I was younger,</i>

59:51.353 --> 59:53.753
<i>I thought if I did
everything right,</i>

59:53.755 --> 59:56.522
<i>I would fit in with
all the other girls.</i>

59:56.524 --> 59:58.891
<i>But I don't think she even
notices me trying.</i>

01:00:00.394 --> 01:00:03.394
<i>She wishes she had
a different daughter.</i>

01:00:04.897 --> 01:00:07.898
<i>I'm gonna love my baby so much.</i>

01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:10.333
<i>I'll let her eat
whatever she wants.</i>

01:00:10.335 --> 01:00:14.570
<i>Wear whatever she wants.
Play with whoever she wants.</i>

01:00:14.572 --> 01:00:16.538
<i>I'm gonna be the best mom ever.</i>

01:00:33.655 --> 01:00:37.489
Do you know where I was when,
uh, olivia barnes got murdered?

01:00:39.493 --> 01:00:41.092
Eating lasagna.

01:00:45.464 --> 01:00:47.663
She'd been missing 72 hours.

01:00:49.767 --> 01:00:52.434
<i>Brittany lyttle's been gone 48.</i>

01:00:57.107 --> 01:00:59.107
- Hi, helen.
- Ronnie.

01:00:59.109 --> 01:01:02.310
I was wondering when you were
going to come by and visit me.

01:01:02.312 --> 01:01:03.744
Come here.

01:01:06.548 --> 01:01:08.781
Oh, my girl.

01:01:09.483 --> 01:01:11.349
<i>Ronnie fuller.</i>

01:01:11.351 --> 01:01:12.650
As damaged as that girl is,

01:01:12.652 --> 01:01:14.585
I wouldn't put
anything past her.

01:01:14.587 --> 01:01:17.688
I checked on alice's story
about arby's.

01:01:17.690 --> 01:01:20.390
The girl on duty doesn't
remember her.

01:01:23.026 --> 01:01:26.593
You grew up so pretty.
I knew you would.

01:01:29.163 --> 01:01:32.097
You don't need all that makeup.

01:01:32.099 --> 01:01:33.932
And obviously you still
bite your nails.

01:01:33.934 --> 01:01:36.367
Don't you know when people
see your bitten-down nails

01:01:36.369 --> 01:01:38.702
They know how nervous you are?

01:01:46.344 --> 01:01:48.277
<i>Where's alice?</i>

01:01:49.546 --> 01:01:51.379
<i>I don't know.</i>

01:01:52.915 --> 01:01:54.781
You know she goes walking.

01:01:59.553 --> 01:02:02.453
<i>I was coming home
from work the other day.</i>

01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:05.989
I drove past the pool
and I saw her.

01:02:05.991 --> 01:02:09.959
You know, at the country club.
Just watching people.

01:02:11.262 --> 01:02:13.161
It made me sad. Hmm.

01:02:35.650 --> 01:02:37.783
Mind if I join you?

01:02:43.557 --> 01:02:46.257
I guess walking's
pretty good for you.

01:02:48.728 --> 01:02:51.295
Is this the route
you usually take?

01:02:56.802 --> 01:02:58.501
What do you want?

01:02:59.537 --> 01:03:01.937
I don't know where she is.

01:03:01.939 --> 01:03:03.004
Who, alice?

01:03:04.107 --> 01:03:05.372
Ronnie.

01:03:07.342 --> 01:03:10.575
We spoke to ronnie fuller.
She was very helpful.

01:03:11.177 --> 01:03:12.976
What did she say?

01:03:12.978 --> 01:03:15.078
Did she lie about me again?

01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:18.381
Did she tell you how she
stole my jack-in-the-box?

01:03:18.383 --> 01:03:21.984
She put it there on purpose
so I would get caught, too.

01:03:21.986 --> 01:03:24.553
But I wasn't there when she
killed that baby.

01:03:24.555 --> 01:03:26.221
But I still went to sheckter
and now you're trying to

01:03:26.223 --> 01:03:30.291
Make this other thing
look like it's my fault.

01:03:30.293 --> 01:03:33.894
Well, what is your fault, alice?
Is anything ever your fault?

01:03:34.463 --> 01:03:36.062
What about you?

01:03:37.265 --> 01:03:38.464
Do you ever wonder what
would have happened

01:03:38.466 --> 01:03:41.834
If maybe you had
found the baby sooner?

01:03:41.836 --> 01:03:44.203
Maybe you could have saved her.

01:03:45.306 --> 01:03:48.840
Maybe if you had walked just
a little bit faster,

01:03:48.842 --> 01:03:51.041
She would still be alive.

01:03:53.845 --> 01:03:56.144
Did you ever think about that?

01:03:58.148 --> 01:04:01.482
I want to be alone.
Am I under arrest or anything?

01:04:07.523 --> 01:04:09.356
<i>Do you remember the honeysuckle?</i>

01:04:11.593 --> 01:04:13.793
Yeah, that time I tried
to make honeysuckle soda

01:04:13.795 --> 01:04:15.661
And sell it from a stand
like lemonade?

01:04:15.663 --> 01:04:19.464
Mmm-hmm. I do. I sure do.

01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:22.300
You picked my vines bare.

01:04:22.302 --> 01:04:25.302
But you didn't mind.
You weren't mad at all.

01:04:26.705 --> 01:04:28.938
It was a good idea, ronnie.

01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:31.607
There should be
honeysuckle soda.

01:04:31.609 --> 01:04:33.474
You have great ideas.
You always did.

01:04:36.111 --> 01:04:37.577
You and me.

01:04:37.579 --> 01:04:39.178
We think alike.

01:04:53.761 --> 01:04:55.026
Ronnie?

01:04:56.362 --> 01:04:59.329
You got anything you need to
tell me, baby?

01:05:03.067 --> 01:05:04.166
No.

01:05:22.283 --> 01:05:23.949
See you.

01:05:36.162 --> 01:05:38.928
Where were you?
Did you get a ride?

01:05:41.198 --> 01:05:43.331
I know you get rides.

01:05:43.333 --> 01:05:46.566
Really? Who do you think
gives me rides?

01:05:48.303 --> 01:05:50.603
I don't know. You tell me.

01:05:50.605 --> 01:05:51.837
Well…

01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:56.708
I take rides from strange men
because I'm fat and lonely

01:05:56.710 --> 01:06:01.145
And I need attention, so I do
things to them. For money.

01:06:02.681 --> 01:06:04.113
Is it true?

01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:13.621
You wish. I got a job.

01:06:13.623 --> 01:06:16.256
Alice, talk to me!
You got a job?

01:06:16.258 --> 01:06:19.058
What do you mean you got a job?

01:06:19.060 --> 01:06:22.995
I got a job. And it has nothing
to do with being fat or lonely.

01:06:33.406 --> 01:06:37.407
Jesus. Laceration of the femoral artery.
Rushed to the er.

01:06:37.409 --> 01:06:40.543
Landed on suicide watch.
What about manning?

01:06:42.046 --> 01:06:46.747
Yeast infection. Yeast infection.
Another yeast infection.

01:06:46.749 --> 01:06:49.716
One, two, three,
four, five, six fights.

01:06:49.718 --> 01:06:51.484
This ronnie was a piece of work.

01:06:51.486 --> 01:06:53.252
She managed to get
in a fight every month.

01:06:53.254 --> 01:06:56.688
Spent most of the last
seven years on lockdown.

01:06:56.690 --> 01:06:58.723
I got a bladder infection
and another yeast infection.

01:06:58.725 --> 01:07:00.124
You know what that means?

01:07:00.126 --> 01:07:02.626
Sounds like she was fucking
to me.

01:07:07.332 --> 01:07:08.831
- Whoa.
- Hmm?

01:07:08.833 --> 01:07:10.065
Get over here.

01:07:19.375 --> 01:07:22.409
<i>She was 15 years old.
He was an adult.</i>

01:07:22.411 --> 01:07:25.011
He was an employee at sheckter.

01:07:25.013 --> 01:07:27.780
Probably seduced her once.

01:07:27.782 --> 01:07:31.016
It couldn't have been
terribly difficult.

01:07:31.018 --> 01:07:34.352
She's so desperate for
attention and acceptance.

01:07:34.354 --> 01:07:36.487
Mmm. I wonder why that is.

01:07:38.256 --> 01:07:39.455
This adult,

01:07:39.457 --> 01:07:41.290
Was he charged
with statutory rape?

01:07:41.292 --> 01:07:44.359
We agreed not to press charges.

01:07:44.361 --> 01:07:46.294
By the time she figured out
she was pregnant

01:07:46.296 --> 01:07:50.732
It was too late for me to
convince her to have an abortion.

01:07:50.734 --> 01:07:52.800
Does alice know
where her baby is?

01:07:52.802 --> 01:07:54.535
Absolutely not.

01:07:54.537 --> 01:07:57.170
No, no, no.
The adoption was private.

01:07:58.273 --> 01:08:01.507
We don't discuss it.
She doesn't think about it.

01:08:02.776 --> 01:08:04.142
How would you know that?

01:08:06.012 --> 01:08:09.780
You're not a mother, are you?
A mother knows these things.

01:08:09.782 --> 01:08:12.282
Where is alice now?
Where is she?

01:08:12.284 --> 01:08:13.850
Where does she go
when she walks?

01:08:13.852 --> 01:08:15.351
She doesn't tell me
where she goes.

01:08:15.353 --> 01:08:19.087
No, ms. Manning, that's not
going to work this time. I'm sorry.

01:08:19.089 --> 01:08:21.689
There's a baby missing.

01:08:21.691 --> 01:08:23.524
And we have reason to believe
that your daughter alice

01:08:23.526 --> 01:08:25.392
Knows something about it.

01:08:25.394 --> 01:08:27.327
So you can
answer our questions here,

01:08:27.328 --> 01:08:29.796
Or I can walk you down
that hall past your peers,

01:08:29.798 --> 01:08:32.832
Take you downtown, have you
answer the questions there.

01:08:38.939 --> 01:08:41.205
She seems to spend
the bulk of her time

01:08:41.207 --> 01:08:44.207
Just hanging out
by the pool at the club.

01:08:46.310 --> 01:08:50.446
Just watching the other kids.
It's pathetic.

01:09:19.707 --> 01:09:21.941
They're gonna catch you,
you know.

01:09:21.943 --> 01:09:24.009
Catch me for what?
I didn't do anything.

01:09:24.011 --> 01:09:25.243
The police think you did.

01:09:26.679 --> 01:09:29.145
It was near where you work.

01:09:29.148 --> 01:09:31.381
It was near where about
a thousand people work.

01:09:38.889 --> 01:09:41.022
There's only one person
like you who works there.

01:09:43.359 --> 01:09:45.024
A baby killer.

01:09:49.663 --> 01:09:54.399
You have to do this, ronnie. Lots of
babies die all the time of natural things.

01:09:54.401 --> 01:09:56.033
Like if they turn
wrong in their crib.

01:09:56.035 --> 01:09:58.168
Just say she died like that.

01:09:58.170 --> 01:09:59.769
I don't want to do it.

01:10:06.611 --> 01:10:09.612
You fed her pudding.
You can't feed a baby pudding.

01:10:09.614 --> 01:10:11.180
You told me to.

01:10:11.182 --> 01:10:13.949
So if alice told you
to jump off of a building,

01:10:13.951 --> 01:10:15.750
Would you do that?

01:10:15.752 --> 01:10:17.218
What about if she told you
to play with matches?

01:10:17.220 --> 01:10:18.886
Would you do that, huh?

01:10:18.888 --> 01:10:22.422
What about if alice told you to
go and find a bridge and leap…

01:10:22.424 --> 01:10:23.890
Shut up.

01:10:27.395 --> 01:10:29.994
Your mom knows
I didn't do anything.

01:10:31.330 --> 01:10:33.129
Stay away from her.

01:10:33.131 --> 01:10:34.563
You don't even live
near us anymore.

01:10:34.565 --> 01:10:37.365
You have no reason
to be hanging around.

01:10:38.301 --> 01:10:40.100
My mom just feels sorry for you.

01:10:40.102 --> 01:10:42.569
She likes me.

01:10:42.571 --> 01:10:44.937
Alice manning.

01:10:46.974 --> 01:10:48.239
You know why I made you do it?

01:10:49.308 --> 01:10:51.308
Because I knew that they would
take you away.

01:10:52.411 --> 01:10:54.978
I thought they would
lock you up forever.

01:10:54.980 --> 01:10:57.013
And I would never have to
play with you again.

01:10:57.815 --> 01:10:59.047
Alice?

01:11:01.184 --> 01:11:03.984
Hurry. She did it!
She just told me everything.

01:11:03.986 --> 01:11:06.186
She took the baby.
You have to catch her.

01:11:06.188 --> 01:11:07.954
- What… Hurry!
- Come on. Let's go, let's go.

01:11:08.623 --> 01:11:10.689
- No!
- No, alice.

01:11:10.691 --> 01:11:12.390
We're not here for her.
We're here for you.

01:11:12.392 --> 01:11:14.325
- I didn't do anything.
- Let's go.

01:11:14.327 --> 01:11:16.694
You don't understand. Ronnie did it.
She just told me.

01:11:16.696 --> 01:11:18.896
Alice! We're walking out,

01:11:18.898 --> 01:11:19.963
Or we're putting you
in handcuffs.

01:11:21.733 --> 01:11:23.532
Come on.

01:11:24.968 --> 01:11:27.835
- It's not fair.
- Mmm-hmm, watch your step.

01:11:34.609 --> 01:11:36.775
- You have the wrong person.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:11:37.978 --> 01:11:39.944
You have to believe me.

01:11:40.346 --> 01:11:42.012
Ronnie did this.

01:12:15.714 --> 01:12:17.246
Alice.

01:12:18.782 --> 01:12:21.015
Where is she, alice?

01:12:22.184 --> 01:12:23.650
Is she okay?

01:12:24.352 --> 01:12:26.051
Did you hurt her?

01:12:38.331 --> 01:12:41.231
Hello, I'm here to see
a detective porter.

01:12:42.867 --> 01:12:45.300
Ms. Manning.

01:12:45.302 --> 01:12:47.168
If you're going to continue
to interrogate my daughter,

01:12:47.170 --> 01:12:48.836
- I want a lawyer present.
- She has her.

01:12:48.838 --> 01:12:51.038
She has brittany.

01:12:56.311 --> 01:12:59.878
Jesus. What…

01:13:01.615 --> 01:13:04.048
- Did she hurt her?
- Where is she?

01:13:05.084 --> 01:13:07.084
I have no idea.

01:13:07.086 --> 01:13:10.353
We have been very patient
with you, mrs. Manning.

01:13:12.056 --> 01:13:15.290
We haven't treated you as
an accessory to this crime.

01:13:15.292 --> 01:13:18.192
Or accused you of shielding
your daughter or withholding

01:13:18.194 --> 01:13:21.795
Information we need.
But that moment is coming.

01:13:22.998 --> 01:13:27.833
Alice doesn't confide
in anyone, least of all me.

01:13:27.835 --> 01:13:31.202
Why does she think brittany
lyttle is her daughter?

01:13:38.076 --> 01:13:39.542
Oh…

01:13:46.817 --> 01:13:49.117
At first he would stare at me.

01:13:58.294 --> 01:14:00.260
<i>You know, kind of flirt.</i>

01:14:03.331 --> 01:14:04.930
<i>He was so cute.</i>

01:14:06.466 --> 01:14:09.033
<i>I had never been
with a boy before.</i>

01:14:11.470 --> 01:14:13.102
<i>I'd never kissed a boy before.</i>

01:14:19.375 --> 01:14:22.275
<i>We couldn't keep our
hands off each other.</i>

01:14:31.352 --> 01:14:33.051
<i>I was so excited.</i>

01:14:36.156 --> 01:14:39.857
<i>And when they took him away,
it was so sudden.</i>

01:14:39.859 --> 01:14:43.360
<i>It happened so quickly,
and I didn't know what to do.</i>

01:14:44.696 --> 01:14:48.364
My mom said I had my
whole life ahead of me.

01:14:48.366 --> 01:14:50.299
And that she had me when
she was really young

01:14:50.301 --> 01:14:53.969
And she didn't regret it
or anything.

01:14:53.971 --> 01:14:57.939
<i>You have to understand. She
became obsessed with the topic.</i>

01:14:57.941 --> 01:15:02.209
Where was her baby?
Why couldn't I raise it?

01:15:02.211 --> 01:15:05.478
Who had adopted her?
She wouldn't leave it alone.

01:15:07.048 --> 01:15:09.982
She was inconsolable.
I had to tell her something.

01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:22.693
I made up a story.

01:15:24.496 --> 01:15:27.730
<i>I said I'd seen her little girl.</i>

01:15:27.732 --> 01:15:31.533
<i>On the west side of town. You know,
near those lovely old victorians.</i>

01:15:32.235 --> 01:15:35.069
<i>I knew alice would like that.</i>

01:15:35.071 --> 01:15:38.438
<i>I told her that her baby
was beautiful, healthy…</i>

01:15:39.641 --> 01:15:41.974
<i>She had cafe au lait skin.</i>

01:15:41.976 --> 01:15:44.142
<i>Beautiful black curly hair.</i>

01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:50.247
It was around that time
that I had seen the mother.

01:15:50.249 --> 01:15:53.550
- The mother.
- You know…

01:15:53.552 --> 01:15:56.986
Cynthia barnes, the mother
of the child that alice…

01:16:00.458 --> 01:16:02.758
<i>She was with this little girl.</i>

01:16:04.361 --> 01:16:07.395
<i>I took one look at that girl
and I knew…</i>

01:16:07.397 --> 01:16:10.898
<i>That child wouldn't exist</i>

01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:13.066
<i>If it weren't for alice.</i>

01:16:17.139 --> 01:16:20.039
<i>Which isn't to say that what
alice did can be</i>

01:16:20.041 --> 01:16:24.910
Rationalized in any way.
I mean, a girl had died.

01:16:24.912 --> 01:16:26.978
And it was my daughter's fault.

01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:32.415
But the fact remains,
another child lives.

01:16:33.618 --> 01:16:36.985
And I'm not sure she would
if it weren't for alice.

01:16:38.888 --> 01:16:42.756
My daughter helped to bring that
little life into the world.

01:16:44.292 --> 01:16:48.760
At least alice can take some comfort
from that little girl's existence.

01:16:50.163 --> 01:16:52.629
When I got out
I had to find her.

01:16:55.033 --> 01:16:57.266
I wanted her.

01:16:57.268 --> 01:16:59.635
I didn't care what my mom said.

01:17:03.273 --> 01:17:07.975
<i>So I started walking.
Just looking for her.</i>

01:17:10.612 --> 01:17:13.679
<i>I also told her that her child</i>

01:17:13.681 --> 01:17:18.616
Had a little birthmark in the
shape of a heart on her back.

01:17:20.953 --> 01:17:23.920
<i>I thought that was
a lovely sort of detail.</i>

01:17:25.723 --> 01:17:29.257
<i>You know, that would give alice
something that she could hold on to.</i>

01:17:31.227 --> 01:17:33.527
<i>Like it was the shadow
of her own heart.</i>

01:17:36.932 --> 01:17:38.631
Alice loved that.

01:17:39.266 --> 01:17:41.699
Mrs. Manning. Sit down.

01:17:43.969 --> 01:17:46.235
Sit down, mrs. Manning. Sit.

01:17:51.708 --> 01:17:53.140
Stay there.

01:18:00.282 --> 01:18:02.215
She had that skin.

01:18:06.587 --> 01:18:08.653
<i>A mix of my skin and his.</i>

01:18:10.957 --> 01:18:13.356
<i>I couldn't believe I found her.</i>

01:18:16.194 --> 01:18:18.527
Brittany?

01:18:18.529 --> 01:18:20.629
She's probably
jumping on a bed somewhere.

01:18:22.332 --> 01:18:26.400
<i>When I saw her back, there
was this little heart there.</i>

01:18:26.402 --> 01:18:28.835
<i>And I knew it was her.</i>

01:18:28.837 --> 01:18:31.838
- Devlin, keep looking!
- Brittany!

01:18:31.840 --> 01:18:35.041
Now, brit, you're going to be in
trouble if you don't come out.

01:18:35.043 --> 01:18:36.509
Hey.

01:18:36.511 --> 01:18:40.079
<i>- Que linda. Que linda.</i> Hi.
- Hi…

01:18:40.081 --> 01:18:43.815
Good girl. Good girl.
Good girl.

01:18:43.817 --> 01:18:45.483
Brittany!

01:18:45.485 --> 01:18:47.251
Where is she?

01:18:47.253 --> 01:18:49.286
Brittany!

01:18:49.288 --> 01:18:53.223
<i>She was so beautiful.
She looked just like rodrigo.</i>

01:18:56.361 --> 01:18:57.960
Brittany! Shit.

01:18:58.329 --> 01:18:59.761
Brittany!

01:19:09.271 --> 01:19:12.772
<i>I asked him to cut her hair
so nobody would find her.</i>

01:19:17.378 --> 01:19:20.712
<i>He was so nervous. His nose
even started bleeding.</i>

01:19:24.484 --> 01:19:27.751
<i>You can't arrest someone
for taking her own baby.</i>

01:19:30.922 --> 01:19:34.123
It took me a long time
to find her.

01:19:34.125 --> 01:19:37.625
But now that I have, you
can't make me give her back.

01:19:39.962 --> 01:19:43.228
I never wanted to give her up
in the first place.

01:19:43.930 --> 01:19:45.529
My mom made me.

01:19:48.634 --> 01:19:51.634
This is brittany lyttle's
birth certificate.

01:19:53.237 --> 01:19:55.536
And this is your baby's.

01:19:58.207 --> 01:20:00.807
They are two
different girls, alice.

01:20:09.684 --> 01:20:11.417
Where is brittany?

01:20:16.457 --> 01:20:18.723
I know what we did was wrong.

01:20:20.159 --> 01:20:22.859
But what happened to me
was wrong, too.

01:20:23.795 --> 01:20:25.894
They took my baby.

01:20:28.298 --> 01:20:29.697
I want her.

01:20:30.332 --> 01:20:31.664
I want her.

01:20:31.666 --> 01:20:35.033
I understand, alice. I do.

01:20:36.669 --> 01:20:38.635
But not everybody will.

01:20:40.705 --> 01:20:42.771
You are in a lot of trouble.

01:20:42.773 --> 01:20:45.940
You could be convicted
of a very serious crime.

01:20:47.410 --> 01:20:51.278
You need to help us.
And we'll help you.

01:20:54.516 --> 01:20:59.118
What do you mean?
Will you help me find my baby?

01:21:03.657 --> 01:21:05.223
No. Alice, no.

01:21:10.229 --> 01:21:14.331
Help me. And I'll help you.

01:21:20.706 --> 01:21:24.274
Rodrigo left her with his mom
while he drove me home

01:21:24.276 --> 01:21:26.843
So that no one would suspect me.

01:21:29.948 --> 01:21:34.083
We planned on keeping her
there while we waited

01:21:34.085 --> 01:21:37.986
For you to think
ronnie fuller took her.

01:21:37.988 --> 01:21:41.589
You know she's done this
before, she might do it again.

01:22:02.343 --> 01:22:05.177
<i>I think she's really sick.</i>

01:22:05.179 --> 01:22:07.746
We should just take her
home to her family.

01:22:08.515 --> 01:22:10.014
It's too late.

01:23:36.526 --> 01:23:40.227
Ronnie? Come in, sweetie.

01:23:40.229 --> 01:23:41.828
- I didn't want to, but she made me.
- What?

01:23:41.830 --> 01:23:43.763
I'm sorry. Please, I'm sorry.

01:23:43.765 --> 01:23:46.465
Ronnie… Ronnie…

01:23:56.776 --> 01:23:58.275
<i>You can't undo what you've done.</i>

01:24:00.812 --> 01:24:06.081
But I can make sure that alice
doesn't go unpunished.

01:24:10.153 --> 01:24:11.952
I can make it fair.

01:24:51.058 --> 01:24:52.524
Hey, mom.

01:25:33.398 --> 01:25:36.465
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
Oh, my god.

01:25:36.467 --> 01:25:38.433
- Yes!
- Oh, my god.

01:25:38.802 --> 01:25:40.101
My baby!

01:25:40.536 --> 01:25:42.569
Hi! Hi!

01:25:42.571 --> 01:25:45.472
- Hey.
- Hi, baby. Hi, baby.

01:25:46.475 --> 01:25:48.408
Oh, my god.

01:25:49.210 --> 01:25:51.076
I love you.

01:25:51.078 --> 01:25:53.411
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

01:25:57.516 --> 01:26:00.283
Thank you. Thank you.

01:26:00.985 --> 01:26:02.417
Thank you.

01:26:08.891 --> 01:26:09.956
Ah!

01:26:13.361 --> 01:26:15.661
Good work, detective.

01:26:25.238 --> 01:26:27.705
<i>Today state prosecution
has agreed to a plea bargain</i>

01:26:27.707 --> 01:26:30.674
<i>With alice manning. All charges
are dropped against her</i>

01:26:30.676 --> 01:26:32.709
<i>While rodrigo gutierrez,
the state employee</i>

01:26:32.711 --> 01:26:35.344
<i>She now has accused
of raping her in prison,</i>

01:26:35.346 --> 01:26:38.347
<i>Will alone serve
10 years for the kidnapping.</i>

01:26:38.349 --> 01:26:41.350
<i>Earlier today miss manning
gave a statement to the press.</i>

01:26:41.352 --> 01:26:43.819
<i>Ladies and gentlemen
of the press.</i>

01:26:43.821 --> 01:26:48.923
<i>Yes, I have something I would like to say.
I am a victim.</i>

01:26:50.126 --> 01:26:53.460
<i>I am a victim
of the justice system.</i>

01:26:53.462 --> 01:26:57.664
As a child, I was wrongly accused
of a crime I did not commit.

01:26:58.767 --> 01:27:03.402
I spent seven years
in a correctional facility

01:27:03.404 --> 01:27:05.704
Where I was raped

01:27:05.706 --> 01:27:09.473
And where I gave birth to
a baby who was taken from me.

01:27:11.510 --> 01:27:15.111
Today justice was served.

01:27:15.113 --> 01:27:17.913
The charges against me
have been dropped

01:27:17.915 --> 01:27:20.715
And the man who
manipulated me as a minor…

01:27:20.717 --> 01:27:21.916
She's good.

01:27:21.918 --> 01:27:24.351
…And who instigated
this crime will be…

01:27:24.353 --> 01:27:26.119
Scary good.

01:27:26.654 --> 01:27:28.520
I can now live freely.

01:27:28.522 --> 01:27:32.156
I can seek to validate
my rights as an adult.

01:27:32.525 --> 01:27:33.924
Thank you.

01:27:35.127 --> 01:27:36.526
Hey, alice! Alice!

01:27:41.265 --> 01:27:43.131
You know who's better?
