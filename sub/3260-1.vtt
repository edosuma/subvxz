01:34.103 --> 01:37.170
- Step forward, please.
- Sir, take your eye line to me.

01:37.270 --> 01:38.837
- What is your name?
- Lieutenant Philipa Boxen.

01:38.937 --> 01:41.770
- Look me dead in the eye.
- I'm gonna ask you a series of questions.

01:41.895 --> 01:45.628
- I'll repeat the question.
- I advise you to take your eyes to me.

01:45.728 --> 01:47.561
- What is your name?
- Claire Grenich.

01:47.686 --> 01:49.711
- Do you know where you are?
- Yeah, East Coast Headquarters.

01:49.811 --> 01:52.128
I need your full cooperation
before I can clear you.

01:52.228 --> 01:53.978
Chester P Huntington.

01:54.103 --> 01:55.795
- What does the P stand for?
- Peter.

01:55.895 --> 01:59.045
- Charlie Kent.
- Captain Seet Johanson.

01:59.145 --> 02:01.811
- How are you feeling?
- Please focus and cooperate with me!

02:01.936 --> 02:04.211
- I'm a BioMed.
- Sir, you must tell me immediately.

02:04.311 --> 02:05.936
- Sir, are you hallucinating?
- No.

02:06.061 --> 02:08.044
- You're quite jittery, sir.
- Harris Menzies.

02:08.145 --> 02:10.544
- My vision is fine.
- I told you that already.

02:10.645 --> 02:13.295
- Huntington, answer the damn question!
- Do you believe in the resurrection?

02:13.395 --> 02:16.170
- It's hot in here.
- How many times have we done this shit?

02:16.270 --> 02:19.103
I'm sure you don't wanna be standing here
all day. And neither do I!

02:19.228 --> 02:21.378
- Pick this up! Come on!
- Yeah.

02:21.478 --> 02:23.936
- What the fuck?
- I don't wanna fucking hear about it.

02:24.061 --> 02:26.336
- I wanna clear you, I wanna...
- Can I get the fuck out of here now?

02:26.436 --> 02:29.170
- I need answers. Kent, stay with me.
- Emma!

02:29.270 --> 02:31.311
I'm looking at you!

03:04.811 --> 03:07.186
Hey, there, early bird.

03:11.353 --> 03:12.811
Everything okay?

03:14.353 --> 03:16.936
I'm either really excited or...

03:17.853 --> 03:20.603
just stone cold shit scared.

03:22.770 --> 03:27.770
Probably both, but that's a good thing.
It'll bring you home each night.

03:29.520 --> 03:31.186
Yeah.

03:39.311 --> 03:43.061
- We are doing the right thing here.
- Well, maybe we're not.

03:44.436 --> 03:48.478
Obviously nothing good can come from
getting us out of this and into a better life.

03:51.186 --> 03:52.770
Is it too early for me?

03:56.478 --> 04:00.603
- Not today.
- The correct answer is not any day.

04:09.311 --> 04:11.561
I've trained my ass off for this.

04:12.270 --> 04:13.895
Yeah.

04:14.603 --> 04:17.728
Which is why those tactical boys
won't know what hit them.

04:19.685 --> 04:22.128
And whatever you have to do...

04:22.228 --> 04:24.811
you come home to us at the end.

04:43.520 --> 04:45.145
That's old school.

04:45.270 --> 04:46.895
- Don't go.
- I have to go...

04:47.020 --> 04:49.645
- You don't have to go. Please? Please?
- I'll take this with me.

04:49.770 --> 04:51.420
- It'll be my lucky charm.
- But actually, you don't have to go.

04:51.520 --> 04:55.395
I promise you... that I'll be home
for dinner tonight.

04:58.895 --> 05:01.853
- Now you stop looking like that.
- I'm not looking like anything.

05:01.978 --> 05:05.920
- I'm gonna take this book. I gotta go.
- No, no, no. Please, please, please.

05:06.020 --> 05:07.395
- No, no, sit down, sit down.
- I can't.

05:07.520 --> 05:09.670
- This is an order, sit down!
- It's my first day!

05:09.770 --> 05:11.895
- I have to go, I have to go to work.
- No. No.

05:12.020 --> 05:14.170
- Are those tears?
- Please?

05:14.270 --> 05:17.228
- I gotta go. I gotta go.
- Please? No.

05:17.603 --> 05:21.003
I'm betting we sit around
doing core drills...

05:21.103 --> 05:23.769
Okay! You bitches ready to rock?

05:24.519 --> 05:26.561
Where's my wing man?

05:27.603 --> 05:29.186
I was looking for my old buddy boy...

05:29.311 --> 05:31.919
not some poser who looks like he
should be over on the east coast.

05:32.019 --> 05:34.228
We hate those pussies.

05:34.353 --> 05:39.478
Ladies and gentleman, Mr. Whit Carmichael's
first day in the big leagues.

05:40.061 --> 05:42.419
Come on, gimme some sugar, Brohemius.

05:42.519 --> 05:45.894
Yeah, in front of the boys,
come on, man. It's all good.

05:46.019 --> 05:47.728
We've all been through it.

05:48.144 --> 05:49.753
- I'm gonna kick your ass.
- That's cute.

05:49.853 --> 05:52.253
- Look how cute they are!
- You said you weren't gonna do this.

05:52.353 --> 05:55.061
And what? You believed me? You good?

05:55.186 --> 05:57.019
- Yeah, I'm good.
- You're gonna fit right in.

05:58.436 --> 06:01.603
Okay, Schmiddy, Fisher, Matson,
you guys are outta here.

06:03.478 --> 06:06.936
- Why we gotta leave?
- Because you're dressed and I ordered it.

06:07.436 --> 06:11.519
We got a 9:30 at technical.
I'll be down in a minute.

06:13.186 --> 06:15.228
Get out of here.

06:24.186 --> 06:27.836
- So, Dave...
- Yeah?

06:27.936 --> 06:30.478
You wanna talk to me about anything?

06:32.103 --> 06:34.378
Not really. Why?

06:34.478 --> 06:37.811
No, I was just going
through the slip logs and...

06:38.103 --> 06:41.353
I noticed something small, real small...

06:41.978 --> 06:44.519
like a couple of minutes missing.

06:46.519 --> 06:48.669
Now to most, that don't
mean much, but to me...

06:48.769 --> 06:52.269
well, it kinda looks like someone
might've borrowed time they didn't have.

06:53.603 --> 06:58.253
Probably just an error,
something that small, you know.

06:58.353 --> 07:00.311
Or a dirty jump.

07:04.519 --> 07:06.853
Who am I talking to here?

07:07.269 --> 07:08.978
My captain...

07:09.811 --> 07:12.044
or my friend?

07:12.144 --> 07:13.519
Both.

07:16.561 --> 07:20.478
- Maybe you don't wanna hear this?
- Sure he does.

07:21.686 --> 07:26.519
- Our trouble's now his trouble. Come on.
- Your trouble's always been my trouble.

07:26.644 --> 07:29.103
Listen, we can't chat about this here.

07:33.519 --> 07:35.144
Okay.

07:35.853 --> 07:37.644
Okay.

07:37.769 --> 07:39.936
Tonight at Sake House, then.

07:40.061 --> 07:43.919
Can't do tonight, I'm sorry.
I promised Lisa I'd be home.

07:44.019 --> 07:45.311
What? You're kidding me.

07:45.478 --> 07:47.961
She's pregnant, you know how she gets.
I promised. She made me promise.

07:48.061 --> 07:51.019
You see what I mean? Puddy-whipped.

07:51.144 --> 07:52.686
Hey, does anybody else know?

07:52.811 --> 07:57.336
All personnel squads 14 to 28
are preparing to jump. I repeat...

07:57.436 --> 08:00.336
- Okay, where we at?
- ...squads 14 to 28 are preparing to jump.

08:00.436 --> 08:03.311
We have no idea what you
will encounter when you arrive.

08:03.436 --> 08:06.794
You know what you've got to do.
You're going in blind.

08:06.894 --> 08:09.436
We have no idea what you'll encounter
when you arrive.

08:09.561 --> 08:12.978
Above all, I want you back safe,
all of you.

08:13.519 --> 08:17.269
All personnel squads 14 to 28
are preparing to jump.

08:18.686 --> 08:23.519
- We're on standby. Grab your gear.
- Back on deck, boys, back on deck.

08:25.769 --> 08:27.669
You are go in...

08:27.769 --> 08:29.978
five, four...

08:30.686 --> 08:34.727
three... two... one.

08:43.769 --> 08:49.186
We have squad 28 incoming
in three... two... one.

08:59.477 --> 09:02.769
- Quarantine breach. Squad 19.
- What happened to the rest of them?

09:03.186 --> 09:05.686
- Squad 21.
- Bronson, put down that weapon!

09:08.186 --> 09:10.186
Bronson, what are you doing?

09:11.936 --> 09:14.936
Don't arm that! Don't arm that!

09:16.977 --> 09:19.227
Okay, we're on, let's go.

09:19.394 --> 09:20.977
Shit.

09:21.269 --> 09:22.894
Emergency lockdown in effect.

09:23.019 --> 09:24.752
- The door is locked!
- Let me at it.

09:24.852 --> 09:26.519
What do you mean it's locked?

09:26.644 --> 09:30.561
Emergency lockdown in effect.
Please remain in your quarters.

09:32.102 --> 09:34.811
Where's security?
We need goddamn reinforcements!

09:36.769 --> 09:38.227
You see that?

09:44.936 --> 09:46.977
We got a fire! We got a fire!

09:49.227 --> 09:51.477
Sit tight. Hold tight.

09:53.936 --> 09:56.227
Get down! Down!

09:59.019 --> 10:01.211
- Dave, get the black box.
- What box?

10:01.311 --> 10:03.477
Dave, you've got the box!
I know you've got it! Get it!

10:03.852 --> 10:06.644
Fuck! Worst fucking day of my life.

10:06.769 --> 10:09.086
- Stay down, buddy boy.
- What's he getting, the jump box?

10:09.186 --> 10:10.919
Why are you getting that thing?
No, no, no, I'm not jumping!

10:11.019 --> 10:12.752
- We're not dirty jumping!
- Check the coordinates.

10:12.852 --> 10:14.502
Don't fucking move.

10:14.602 --> 10:17.186
- What have we got, Dave?
- Infini, where the fuck is that?

10:17.311 --> 10:19.752
- Come on, show me, show me.
- It's off the grid.

10:19.852 --> 10:22.894
- That can't be right! It's off the grid!
- Check it again!

10:23.019 --> 10:25.294
- ...Delta sequence commencing.
- Fuck!

10:25.394 --> 10:27.586
What's delta lockdown?
Dave, what's delta lockdown?

10:27.686 --> 10:30.769
- We're gonna fucking die, man.
- We gotta dirty jump, right now.

10:30.894 --> 10:34.711
To where those other guys went?
To where those other fucking guys went?

10:34.811 --> 10:37.877
The next step after a delta lockdown
is stasis! You know that!

10:37.977 --> 10:40.627
Our destination is fixed to wherever
this is and I ain't fucking going!

10:40.727 --> 10:42.727
We've gotta jump, now!

10:43.102 --> 10:45.002
Shit, they're gassing!

10:45.102 --> 10:47.727
- Go, go, go!
- Just don't move, don't move.

10:49.019 --> 10:52.061
It's... hang on, hang on, hang on.

10:52.811 --> 10:55.894
You're good. Move, move! He's done.

10:58.227 --> 11:00.502
- Something at APEX is shutting me out.
- Fucking fix it!

11:00.602 --> 11:03.336
- Your clearances are too high to crack!
- Dave, you can fix it!

11:03.436 --> 11:07.061
I can't, it's not fucking letting me in!
I can't fucking break the code!

11:09.769 --> 11:12.394
Carmichael, you're out in five.

11:15.852 --> 11:18.769
Oh, Jesus.
It's all right, it's all right.

11:18.894 --> 11:21.377
We're gonna figure this out, right?

11:21.477 --> 11:23.936
Sef, I can't die here.

11:24.269 --> 11:28.186
I don't wanna die, Sef.
I gotta get home. I gotta get home.

11:30.811 --> 11:32.644
Buddy boy?

11:40.936 --> 11:44.269
- Have you seen these new plasmid readings?
- I'm seeing everything. That's my job.

11:44.394 --> 11:47.769
Look, if it is not a fucking fact,
I don't wanna know about it.

11:49.894 --> 11:55.544
Good morning. Menzies, Jacklar, Huntington,
Captain Johanson, Grenich, Kent,

11:55.644 --> 11:58.019
this is Philipa Boxen,
your acting lieutenant.

11:58.311 --> 12:00.586
She's just passing through. Be nice.

12:00.686 --> 12:04.127
Rex Manning's been drafted in as added
security. You're gonna fucking need it.

12:04.227 --> 12:06.644
In front of you is a sample
of what is already in your kits.

12:06.769 --> 12:08.877
I'll get to that in a moment.
Now listen up.

12:08.977 --> 12:12.461
I'm getting this intel as you are. There's
way too much conjecture for my liking.

12:12.561 --> 12:17.085
I'm calling bullshit on half of this,
remember that. Here we go.

12:17.185 --> 12:18.877
The OI Infini...

12:18.977 --> 12:21.419
the furthest outpost in our galaxy.

12:21.519 --> 12:24.669
Sitting on a rock devoid of life,
devoid of light,

12:24.769 --> 12:27.502
and frozen to the point
of near infinite crush.

12:27.602 --> 12:30.210
Claire, you sure you're all right?

12:30.310 --> 12:32.269
Please, please, be quiet.

12:33.852 --> 12:38.835
But what she's best known for
is the worst deep space disaster in history.

12:38.935 --> 12:44.252
1,600 men and women, all workers,
killed when the mineral aggregate opus...

12:44.352 --> 12:46.810
a potential mined energy source
unique to that planet,

12:46.935 --> 12:50.252
turned out to be highly volatile
under normal operating conditions.

12:50.352 --> 12:52.477
Then why build a station out there
in the first place?

12:52.602 --> 12:55.419
- They should've known that beforehand.
- Yeah, my thoughts exactly.

12:55.519 --> 12:58.769
The station was permanently shut down
and all pending shipments halted...

12:58.894 --> 13:01.794
an order classified code Zephyr

13:01.894 --> 13:04.877
in the realisation, and I quote...

13:04.977 --> 13:09.669
"A catastrophic global event was imminent
if the contents of any one payload

13:09.769 --> 13:11.169
"ever met with our atmosphere".

13:11.269 --> 13:14.894
Which is where
the real shit-storm occurs.

13:15.227 --> 13:18.710
12 minutes ago,
west coast slip stream depot 946

13:18.810 --> 13:22.002
attempted to recall
research officer Montoli Reece...

13:22.102 --> 13:25.810
from active duty
on mining station Infini.

13:27.019 --> 13:30.085
Now, we know Montoli was part
of an inspection team of 15

13:30.185 --> 13:33.644
sent to assess the site
following the recent disaster.

13:34.435 --> 13:37.835
During the time out there, something
happened to the other members of the crew

13:37.935 --> 13:39.769
resulting in their deaths.

13:41.435 --> 13:43.602
HQ tried to pull Montoli out...

13:43.727 --> 13:47.769
he crippled his APEX device
to remain on the facility.

13:52.310 --> 13:55.644
- So are we talking villain or saviour here?
- I would definitely go with the former...

13:55.769 --> 13:59.519
expect phenordementia,
maybe even rhombust psychosis.

14:03.060 --> 14:05.544
So should we be expecting
some sort of fire fight out there?

14:05.644 --> 14:09.002
- Jacklar, I don't fucking know.
- Well, we've got Rex Mannings.

14:09.102 --> 14:12.727
Be prepared for anything. Okay, listen!

14:13.227 --> 14:15.019
Whilst on Infini...

14:15.144 --> 14:19.685
Montoli was able to bring base operations
back online via the local network,

14:19.810 --> 14:21.752
then severed remote connection.

14:21.852 --> 14:23.519
He has prepped a payload...

14:23.644 --> 14:27.310
to be delivered to an undisclosed
location here on Earth.

14:28.477 --> 14:32.435
Given the slipstreams,
is six minutes from now.

14:34.644 --> 14:38.894
I don't have to tell you how important
this mission is. Wait.

14:50.560 --> 14:52.310
We just lost the west coast.

14:52.894 --> 14:56.310
- Which squad?
- Every single person.

14:57.810 --> 15:00.060
The entire division.

15:02.144 --> 15:05.544
- Shit.
- They jumped in to extract Montoli.

15:05.644 --> 15:09.769
I'm hearing... they think
it's an airborne threat out there.

15:11.269 --> 15:13.685
West coast went into lockdown.

15:14.144 --> 15:16.144
Goddamn.

15:16.852 --> 15:18.519
They had to be lethally quarantined.

15:21.852 --> 15:25.085
What about the ones in the field?
On Infini?

15:25.185 --> 15:27.477
We're hearing someone had the insight
to blow out the compartment housing

15:27.602 --> 15:30.210
that sent the whole station
into a deep freeze.

15:30.310 --> 15:34.877
- So they're all dead.
- No, no. All but one.

15:34.977 --> 15:39.310
Whit Carmichael. 34, basic grunt,
sub-specialty survival tech.

15:39.435 --> 15:42.085
Looks like he eventually wanted
to become one of you.

15:42.185 --> 15:44.710
Smart guy. What did he do?

15:44.810 --> 15:49.060
Records show an illegal jump into Infini,
assumably to escape the lockdown.

15:50.102 --> 15:53.668
Okay, okay, locator markers have him
last pegged in the furnace control room.

15:53.768 --> 15:56.268
That makes sense. It seals tight
in an emergency to protect the core.

15:56.393 --> 15:59.727
He's been out there a week already.
His rations will be getting low.

15:59.852 --> 16:02.502
A week? He only left Earth
a few minutes ago.

16:02.602 --> 16:03.918
Yeah, correct.

16:04.018 --> 16:06.418
So we're talking
serious time dilation here.

16:06.518 --> 16:09.127
I'm reading a whole bunch of singularity,
black hole bullshit, but basically,

16:09.227 --> 16:12.310
you're gonna be gone for one minute,
14 seconds of our time

16:12.435 --> 16:15.893
which will give you just over 24 hours,
one day out there.

16:16.685 --> 16:18.352
- Okay.
- Great.

16:18.477 --> 16:22.168
Guys, best case scenario, they can
get us out of there in two hours.

16:22.268 --> 16:24.002
- There's no safety net!
- That's right.

16:24.102 --> 16:28.418
It is a long way from home,
the furthest you have ever been.

16:28.518 --> 16:31.002
Now, your primary order...

16:31.102 --> 16:35.310
is to stop that payload leaving Infini
and bring this Carmichael home.

16:35.810 --> 16:37.977
The focused military approach
has proven ineffective.

16:38.102 --> 16:41.685
We are relying on you, our best search
and rescue team, to get this job done.

16:41.810 --> 16:44.102
Deployment in 45 seconds.

16:44.227 --> 16:46.710
- What's with the antiques?
- Nothing else will work out there.

16:46.810 --> 16:49.768
We're hearing current plasma tech is rendered
useless against the electrical fields.

16:49.893 --> 16:52.543
You will be relying solely
on basic packs.

16:52.643 --> 16:56.768
- Even our readouts?
- Everything... 30 seconds.

16:58.435 --> 17:00.418
There better be a hell
of a big bonus for this.

17:00.518 --> 17:03.227
You bring this in,
I deliver the credits myself.

17:03.352 --> 17:05.417
Your suits are sealed
with two layers of resistance,

17:05.518 --> 17:07.627
but won't stand that level
of cold indefinitely.

17:07.727 --> 17:11.893
I have marked all generators
and key locations on your maps.

17:12.018 --> 17:17.018
- You said airborne contagion.
- It is an assumption, like a lot of this.

17:19.352 --> 17:21.393
Ten seconds!

17:21.685 --> 17:24.542
All right, nothing stupid.
Safe and steady.

17:24.643 --> 17:27.602
There's a reason
they bring us in last, right?

17:28.768 --> 17:30.227
We'll see you in a minute.

17:41.685 --> 17:43.768
Kent, where are we at?

17:44.227 --> 17:47.352
Storage room. Lower deck, level three.

17:48.977 --> 17:51.185
You got any thermal reads?

17:51.310 --> 17:54.918
No, it's too cold. It's 70 below.

17:55.018 --> 17:57.918
- I'm not gonna see anything on this.
- Stay on it anyway.

17:58.018 --> 18:00.310
I'm not reading anything
for air contaminants

18:00.435 --> 18:03.602
but we are surrounded
by some kind of coolant agent.

18:03.727 --> 18:05.477
- Boxen.
- Yeah?

18:05.602 --> 18:08.602
- Take Jacklar to find Carmichael.
- Yes, sir.

18:08.727 --> 18:11.752
Menzies, Grenich and Kent,
you're on payload.

18:11.852 --> 18:15.502
We'll use the service tunnels. I've marked
your access points on your maps.

18:15.602 --> 18:18.377
Keep moving. This cold will set in
much faster than you think.

18:18.477 --> 18:22.877
All right, Mannings, Huntington,
you're with me to the generators.

18:22.977 --> 18:26.810
Everyone stay on the comms.
We regroup back in the control room.

18:26.977 --> 18:30.435
Boxen, if you find this Carmichael guy,
if there's any risk,

18:30.560 --> 18:33.102
- you call it in to assess.
- Got ya, Cap.

18:33.227 --> 18:36.852
Payload is priority.
So is getting home alive. Let's move.

18:37.352 --> 18:38.918
- Loud and clear.
- Jacklar, let's go.

18:39.018 --> 18:41.685
Huntington, move.

18:42.102 --> 18:44.268
Don't touch anything!

19:39.101 --> 19:43.085
Okay, guys, we got some bodies here.
Keep it tight.

19:43.185 --> 19:46.768
I must say, I was a bit surprised to see you
at the meeting this morning, Mannings.

19:46.893 --> 19:50.085
Well, it was a late call.
Babysitting mission.

19:50.185 --> 19:52.918
- For who?
- Keep Huntington out of trouble.

19:53.018 --> 19:56.643
- The babysitter.
- Yeah, well, it looks that way.

19:56.768 --> 19:59.710
Someone wants to make sure
you get the east coast command...

19:59.810 --> 20:01.476
not like these poor bastards.

20:01.601 --> 20:03.543
What the fuck is he talking about,
Huntington?

20:03.643 --> 20:05.560
Last job.

20:05.976 --> 20:09.643
- He's moving up in the world.
- You wanna be in politics?

20:09.768 --> 20:12.601
- Governor Huntington.
- Which way, Huntington?

20:12.726 --> 20:14.810
Should be stairs up the front there.

20:22.643 --> 20:26.685
Man, if there's anything alive in this
shithole, they gotta be hearing that.

20:27.268 --> 20:29.393
Let's hope so.

20:41.726 --> 20:44.018
Okay, I think we're good.

20:50.351 --> 20:52.976
Holy shit. Look at his neck.

20:56.560 --> 20:59.601
- Embolised arteries... interesting.
- Yeah.

21:04.685 --> 21:07.043
This cold's worse than whatever
screwed with the plasmids.

21:07.143 --> 21:09.310
Tell me about it. My PDA is fucked.

21:09.435 --> 21:14.226
Two more cross sections down on our right
will lead through to operations. Let's move.

21:35.143 --> 21:37.393
Could use a little heat
in this place, you know?

21:38.185 --> 21:40.935
This guy did a real number here.

21:41.893 --> 21:43.585
What are your thoughts?

21:43.685 --> 21:45.893
You know what? Actually not that hard.

21:46.018 --> 21:48.560
The software might be
a different trick, though.

21:54.268 --> 21:56.643
What's powering this?

21:57.310 --> 22:00.601
Yeah. Yeah, that's a good question.

22:02.018 --> 22:05.185
It's definitely on a different circuit
to the station.

22:26.185 --> 22:28.226
Wait, wait.

22:28.893 --> 22:30.768
Listen.

22:33.226 --> 22:36.185
Metal on metal. Let's move.

22:45.768 --> 22:49.643
Claire, heat will be on soon. Just focus
on having that panel prepped, okay?

22:49.768 --> 22:52.376
Still reading all clear on the air.

22:52.476 --> 22:56.168
As expected, these particles
show traces of human compounds...

22:56.268 --> 22:58.643
zinc, magnesium, H2O,
but nothing harmful.

22:58.934 --> 23:01.184
Don't sound so disappointed, Menzies.

23:01.601 --> 23:04.934
Just hoping for something other
than this goddamn cold to kill me.

23:11.768 --> 23:13.643
Come on!

23:15.393 --> 23:17.768
- Rex?
- Yeah.

23:25.518 --> 23:29.018
Okay, we got a body. Seet, two o'clock.

23:29.684 --> 23:31.809
- Clear?
- Clear.

23:48.101 --> 23:50.393
What the fuck is that?

23:54.601 --> 23:58.476
Hey, don't touch!
I don't know what it is.

23:59.809 --> 24:02.059
Right through the neck.

24:04.768 --> 24:08.168
- No entry point.
- Let's get to the generators.

24:08.268 --> 24:11.143
Huntington, where are the generators?

24:11.476 --> 24:13.851
- Two doors on the left.
- Copy that.

24:14.268 --> 24:16.059
Let's move.

24:16.268 --> 24:18.851
- Move.
- Okay, just don't touch.

24:20.351 --> 24:21.643
Jesus Christ.

24:33.809 --> 24:35.684
Oh, man.

24:36.601 --> 24:39.643
Nine days in this place?
Who knows what's through that door.

24:39.768 --> 24:42.126
I'm gonna try him. Whit Carmichael...

24:42.226 --> 24:46.393
this is Philipa Boxen with SS Tier 1
Search and Rescue. Can you hear me?

24:50.101 --> 24:51.876
Ask again.

24:51.976 --> 24:53.268
Whit Carmichael...

24:53.393 --> 24:58.143
this is Philipa Boxen with SS Tier 1
Search and Rescue. Can you hear me?

25:00.434 --> 25:02.001
Nothing?

25:02.101 --> 25:05.101
Nah, wall's too thick.
No way reception's getting through.

25:11.018 --> 25:13.309
Fucking gloves.

25:14.268 --> 25:17.101
I'm used to doing this with my fingers.

25:17.393 --> 25:19.459
I'm gonna take a look at the surrounds.

25:19.559 --> 25:22.809
Yeah. Yeah, go.

25:24.351 --> 25:27.018
I need a moment with this fucking thing.

25:33.351 --> 25:37.293
The furnace is running on bare minimum,
and we've lost contact with Carmichael.

25:37.393 --> 25:40.143
Closing these vents
would be a good start.

25:43.559 --> 25:47.434
- Generator, what's the deal?
- Chester's working on it.

25:47.934 --> 25:50.251
I'm looking for the bar.

25:50.351 --> 25:52.376
What did you just say?

25:52.476 --> 25:54.918
Mannings, did you just say
you were looking for a bar?

25:55.018 --> 25:59.434
Just making sure I'm the first asshole to be
eaten by the monsters when they appear.

26:00.268 --> 26:03.559
Boxen, Mannings, off the comms.

26:38.226 --> 26:40.934
Huntington, I found the mess hall.

26:42.601 --> 26:44.976
Nothing happening here.

26:46.601 --> 26:49.001
Don't fucking be mean!

26:49.101 --> 26:50.892
Don't be mean!

26:51.017 --> 26:55.559
My balls are fucking shrinking
from the cold, you son of a fucking bitch!

26:58.392 --> 26:59.851
Hello!

27:01.434 --> 27:03.059
Yeah!

27:09.434 --> 27:12.167
Okay, good job, guys.

27:12.267 --> 27:14.184
Good job.

27:25.601 --> 27:29.876
Kent, we got a program here and it looks
like it's running... I don't know.

27:29.976 --> 27:32.726
- Yeah, I'm seeing the same thing.
- Can you work it?

27:33.434 --> 27:36.001
- Do you know any Latin?
- Why would I?

27:36.101 --> 27:38.559
Exactly. It's a dead language,
just like this one.

27:39.184 --> 27:41.309
Give me a second,
I'll see what I can do.

27:58.434 --> 28:00.684
Cap, are you seeing this?

28:01.226 --> 28:03.309
Guys, give me a minute.

28:05.476 --> 28:07.976
Go dark on comms.

29:13.517 --> 29:15.434
What's happening?

29:16.642 --> 29:18.809
Cap, you on top of this?

29:21.101 --> 29:24.351
- Cap, you getting this?
- The air is purging!

29:24.851 --> 29:27.584
- Hey, what did you do?
- I'm not doing it.

29:27.684 --> 29:30.584
- Tell me what's going on here, man.
- I can't find Rex.

29:30.684 --> 29:33.976
- Seet, what's going on?
- Rex, where the hell are you, man?

29:34.101 --> 29:35.517
Cap, you touch something?

29:36.726 --> 29:38.351
Cap!

29:41.142 --> 29:44.059
Everybody, stay where you are.
We're not in control here.

29:48.767 --> 29:53.767
- Is everyone feeling okay?
- Relax. We're stabilising.

29:54.434 --> 29:56.559
Time to get warm.

29:58.434 --> 30:02.209
It's just steam, guys, it's steam.
Oh, fuck, my visor's cracking!

30:02.309 --> 30:06.542
Yeah, they build them strong, okay? Temp
is skyrocketing, but you will hold. Trust me.

30:06.642 --> 30:08.267
It's okay. The suit will hold.

30:09.434 --> 30:11.017
We got movement!

30:13.225 --> 30:16.375
We may have contact
with Carmichael. Standby.

30:16.475 --> 30:19.517
Copy that. Be careful.

30:40.142 --> 30:42.475
Raise your hands.

30:43.559 --> 30:47.100
- Raise your hands now!
- Where we can see them.

30:48.684 --> 30:51.267
You've got about two seconds
before I light you up.

30:51.392 --> 30:55.225
Raise your fucking hands now! Slowly.

30:56.684 --> 30:59.017
Identify yourself.

31:01.934 --> 31:05.850
- What's your name?
- What's your name, soldier?

31:09.517 --> 31:11.517
Carmichael.

31:12.225 --> 31:14.517
My name is Whit Carmichael.

31:23.850 --> 31:26.209
I had to be certain.

31:26.309 --> 31:29.309
100 percent certain that you guys
weren't like the others.

31:30.975 --> 31:32.725
As in the rest of your squad?

31:32.850 --> 31:36.142
As in every fucking soldier
that slipstreamed in here!

31:37.600 --> 31:39.809
This place was
a fucking slaughter house.

31:40.934 --> 31:44.309
It started with the miners attacking
and then everything, everyone, they just...

31:45.017 --> 31:47.709
Wait. I thought all the miners
were killed in a blast.

31:47.809 --> 31:50.542
Yeah, well, no one
fucking told them that!

31:50.642 --> 31:53.250
These guys were fucking berserk.

31:53.350 --> 31:57.309
They were deformed and they were
real strong and they were fucking insane!

31:58.392 --> 32:00.834
What caused it?
If not airborne, then what?

32:00.934 --> 32:03.267
I don't know...
I don't know if it's a...

32:03.392 --> 32:07.084
It's contagion of sorts.
I don't fucking know.

32:07.184 --> 32:12.250
Whenever they touched each other,
skin to skin or fucking blood or whatever...

32:12.350 --> 32:17.225
these guys were clawing at their skin
like it was burned in acid.

32:22.475 --> 32:24.767
It was like these...

32:26.142 --> 32:28.975
It was like these urges
just overtook them.

32:29.975 --> 32:32.167
That's some urge.

32:32.267 --> 32:34.017
My APEX didn't fire.

32:34.559 --> 32:36.584
I thought I'd get home, I didn't.

32:36.684 --> 32:40.184
Your entire west coast sector
was lethally quarantined.

32:40.809 --> 32:42.934
Nobody was there to bring you home.

32:45.725 --> 32:48.767
And how did you manage
to be the only one left alive?

32:52.017 --> 32:53.809
I hid.

32:55.225 --> 32:58.392
I hid inside a fucking ducting vent.

33:00.267 --> 33:02.309
And I fucking crawled away.

33:04.267 --> 33:06.959
And I found myself in this room,
in this furnace room.

33:07.059 --> 33:10.600
It was powered on a separate route
to the main line.

33:12.059 --> 33:16.333
And then when I...
I fired up the monitors and...

33:16.433 --> 33:20.350
when I saw what was still
fucking going on...

33:20.725 --> 33:24.517
I blew the external vents
and I sealed myself in.

33:25.308 --> 33:27.392
Killing everybody in here.

33:40.058 --> 33:41.417
Fuck!

33:41.517 --> 33:43.892
He did what he had to do.

33:46.475 --> 33:48.392
Take mine.

33:51.017 --> 33:53.392
That's some story.

33:54.183 --> 33:55.725
In the mess hall,

33:56.017 --> 33:58.767
I found human body parts removed

33:58.892 --> 34:01.933
and placed in their categories
based on their functionality.

34:02.808 --> 34:05.350
What can you tell me about that?

34:06.142 --> 34:08.667
I had fucking nothing
to do with that, man.

34:08.766 --> 34:10.641
I swear.

34:12.433 --> 34:14.600
There's no one else
on the station, right?

34:14.725 --> 34:16.891
Almost the entire station's
been exposed to the freeze.

34:17.016 --> 34:19.958
I've seen nothing on the monitors since,
no movement, nothing.

34:20.058 --> 34:22.225
And you turned everything on...

34:22.683 --> 34:28.141
the power, the vents, everything, right?

34:29.308 --> 34:32.458
My first job out of term school
was writing code.

34:32.558 --> 34:35.850
This stuff, it's old, it runs
on ASCII and basic binary.

34:36.100 --> 34:37.808
It's just maths and simple commands.

34:37.933 --> 34:41.641
Wait, wait, wait. You figured out
how to run the entire station through that?

34:41.766 --> 34:44.500
It just took a little time.
I've had fucking plenty of that.

34:44.600 --> 34:46.350
Whit, listen...

34:47.100 --> 34:51.058
we need to take the payload offline
permanently. Can you do it?

34:57.558 --> 34:59.642
You motherfuckers aren't here
for me at all, are you?

34:59.850 --> 35:01.850
- Of course we are.
- Shut the fuck up!

35:01.975 --> 35:03.933
It's just the order.

35:09.433 --> 35:13.000
- When do we leave?
- Chester will recode your APEX.

35:13.100 --> 35:16.517
I said how fucking long
until we slipstream home?

35:17.600 --> 35:21.058
- Just over 22 hours.
- No.

35:21.517 --> 35:23.892
- No, no, no, no, no.
- Hey.

35:25.600 --> 35:27.100
You got a family?

35:30.767 --> 35:34.350
- You got kids?
- My wife's pregnant.

35:36.100 --> 35:38.308
We will get you home.

35:39.183 --> 35:42.975
Okay? But you have to help us first.

35:47.892 --> 35:50.142
We need your help.

35:52.017 --> 35:54.433
Just get me the fuck out of here.

35:56.225 --> 35:58.975
- What are you doing?
- Give me a second and don't touch anything.

36:01.308 --> 36:05.042
- How do we know this guy is in the same...
- I don't wanna talk about this here.

36:05.142 --> 36:07.683
Come on. Come on.

36:14.600 --> 36:17.308
X is 3247 minus 450Z.

36:17.433 --> 36:20.808
That's 124... That's a 4... 148.

36:21.808 --> 36:24.017
It's 148.

36:28.850 --> 36:31.850
Pacific Ocean just off San Francisco.

36:33.183 --> 36:35.475
That's where your payload's headed.

36:35.600 --> 36:37.558
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

36:42.558 --> 36:45.600
God, I need someone
to go back down to operations!

36:45.725 --> 36:46.766
For what?

36:47.433 --> 36:50.250
I think I can get the payload offline.
I need someone down there on the dials.

36:50.350 --> 36:51.708
You mean, the terminal?
It's still pretty raw.

36:51.808 --> 36:55.666
I can do the terminals from here. I need
someone down there to force the override.

36:55.766 --> 36:58.641
- I'm on it. Cap
- Go.

37:00.058 --> 37:03.850
Whit... patch in to my comms,
frequency 12.107.

37:05.558 --> 37:08.183
Grenich, Jacklar, go with him.

37:08.600 --> 37:11.416
- Hey, what's that guy's name?
- Menzies. Harris Menzies.

37:11.516 --> 37:14.600
Be safe. Hey, you look after them.

37:15.475 --> 37:17.433
- Hey, Menzies, you hear me?
- Loud and proud.

37:17.558 --> 37:19.558
Okay, just hold tight.

37:23.933 --> 37:26.125
I expect an early extraction after this.

37:26.225 --> 37:28.141
You deliver and so will I.

37:32.183 --> 37:35.875
You know what? You guys should check
this out. Take a look out this window.

37:35.975 --> 37:38.558
- Why?
- Just check it out.

37:54.558 --> 37:57.683
At least now we know
what's powering the station.

38:04.600 --> 38:07.416
You've certainly been
a welcome addition, Carmichael.

38:07.516 --> 38:09.791
Promised my wife I'd be home for dinner.

38:09.891 --> 38:12.166
Technically, it's not even lunch
back on Earth.

38:12.266 --> 38:14.100
Ten minutes, that's all I've been gone.

38:14.391 --> 38:16.375
Does your head in if you think
about it too much.

38:16.475 --> 38:18.558
It's the only thing
that's kept me going.

38:18.683 --> 38:22.516
Yeah, I've got a little girl expecting me
at a school science fair this afternoon.

38:23.266 --> 38:25.933
- You got a daughter?
- Yeah.

38:26.058 --> 38:28.766
- How old?
- Six.

38:28.891 --> 38:32.266
- What's her name?
- Josephine Emma.

38:32.391 --> 38:34.475
That's a beautiful name.

38:34.975 --> 38:35.891
Thanks.

38:36.308 --> 38:39.166
What do you tell her
when you go to work?

38:39.266 --> 38:41.933
What are we supposed
to do with this? It's shot.

38:43.641 --> 38:46.516
Daddy loves you
all the way to the Milky Way.

38:46.850 --> 38:49.558
Not the short way, but the long way.

38:53.350 --> 38:56.391
Are you in that room yet?
Are you in the furnace room yet?

38:56.891 --> 38:59.333
- Yeah.
- Just hold tight.

38:59.433 --> 39:01.766
We didn't need you
to come down here with us.

39:01.891 --> 39:04.516
I can do this on my own.

39:04.641 --> 39:06.916
What can you do on your own, Claire?

39:07.016 --> 39:10.975
Look at our lives, Morgan. Look at it.

39:11.100 --> 39:13.791
- It wouldn't work.
- Yeah, look at our lives.

39:13.891 --> 39:16.100
A child needs support on all levels.

39:16.225 --> 39:20.266
- I would walk away from this in a heartbeat.
- Menzies, are you standing by?

39:21.100 --> 39:22.166
Yeah.

39:22.266 --> 39:24.416
I need the furnaces to think
they're gonna go critical,

39:24.516 --> 39:26.141
that way I can access the override.

39:26.266 --> 39:27.708
- You understand?
- Yeah.

39:27.808 --> 39:30.500
- Grenich, I need you on the valves.
- Which one?

39:30.600 --> 39:33.308
Start at B3 and you work
your way round from there.

39:59.266 --> 40:01.850
I would've done the same thing, Whit.

40:05.766 --> 40:08.766
I would've locked myself up
in this control room.

40:09.766 --> 40:12.808
And I would've blown
these external vents.

40:14.766 --> 40:16.724
Fuck 'em, right?

40:18.099 --> 40:20.266
Gotta think of yourself.

40:21.058 --> 40:24.224
You had a wife. Baby on the way, right?

40:25.933 --> 40:29.141
That's what you gotta be
thinking about, I get it.

40:33.849 --> 40:36.141
Are you infected, Whit?

40:37.933 --> 40:39.516
Whit?

40:40.224 --> 40:42.433
Are you infected?

40:44.724 --> 40:46.516
Let me look at your eyes.

40:48.683 --> 40:50.766
Let me see your eyes.

40:52.433 --> 40:56.808
- If you don't show me your eyes...
- Do I look infected?

40:56.933 --> 40:59.349
Look. Take a good look.

41:01.933 --> 41:06.683
If I was infected, I would've ripped your
fucking east coast throat out, trust me.

41:08.724 --> 41:11.016
Now, why don't you fuck off
and let me do your job?

41:18.558 --> 41:21.166
It's nothing to worry about.
It's just the alarm for the override.

41:21.266 --> 41:23.474
- It lasts about ten minutes. That's all.
- You kidding me?

41:23.599 --> 41:25.683
Carmichael, have you done
this kind of thing before?

41:25.808 --> 41:28.833
Okay, Grenich, you start winding
your way back right now! Go!

41:28.933 --> 41:30.458
Yeah.

41:30.558 --> 41:32.416
I'm turning.

41:32.516 --> 41:34.349
Safety valve off.

41:34.891 --> 41:36.766
Gauge isn't responding!

41:36.891 --> 41:38.933
- It's in the red!
- Should we be worried?

41:39.058 --> 41:42.374
No, no, no. It's just 'cause the furnaces
are hitting critical, that's all.

41:42.474 --> 41:47.374
What? Carmichael, the furnaces at critical
could take this whole place apart.

41:47.474 --> 41:49.141
She's right.

41:49.766 --> 41:51.166
Shit!

41:51.266 --> 41:53.416
- Carmichael, you okay with this?
- Yeah, I got it, I got it!

41:53.516 --> 41:55.266
My people are down there.

42:10.391 --> 42:12.058
Menzies! Now! Go now!

42:14.099 --> 42:16.724
We need to bring this down, Carmichael.

42:23.058 --> 42:26.516
I need those levels dropped on the furnace!
You tell me when they're in amber!

42:29.641 --> 42:32.724
- Grenich! Jacklar!
- Where are we at?

42:34.474 --> 42:36.583
Already falling.

42:36.683 --> 42:39.124
Cap, we're out of the red.

42:39.224 --> 42:40.849
Yes!

42:44.641 --> 42:46.808
Captain, your payload is offline.

42:46.933 --> 42:48.558
Good work, Menzies.

42:50.058 --> 42:53.141
- We regroup in the control room.
- Loud and clear.

42:55.808 --> 42:57.766
Let's get the fuck out of here.

42:57.891 --> 43:01.724
Okay, I am now deleting all controls
beyond that so that no one else...

43:20.058 --> 43:21.808
Chester!

43:21.933 --> 43:24.349
Mannings, med kit!

43:26.641 --> 43:29.374
- Chester, get over here!
- Fuck!

43:29.474 --> 43:33.458
- Cap! Chester!
- Chester!

43:33.558 --> 43:35.641
Get over there!

43:36.016 --> 43:38.974
- What's going on up there?
- The captain's been attacked.

43:39.099 --> 43:41.891
- Cap? Come on.
- Check his wound.

43:42.474 --> 43:46.641
- No! Wait! Wait!
- They need us, Menzies.

43:47.266 --> 43:50.516
Carmichael, do you hear me?

43:51.141 --> 43:52.974
Wait!

43:54.432 --> 43:57.682
- I don't wanna die.
- You said there was no one else in here!

44:01.391 --> 44:03.891
Seet! Seet!

44:06.807 --> 44:08.224
Rex!

44:26.891 --> 44:30.349
Jesus, Rex! Fuck!

45:00.016 --> 45:01.891
Get it out of me!

45:05.474 --> 45:08.224
Help me, Charlie!

45:08.349 --> 45:10.307
Get it out of me!

45:19.391 --> 45:21.974
Carmichael!

45:29.391 --> 45:32.682
Menzies, you stay away. You find somewhere
and you fucking hide. You hear me?

45:33.516 --> 45:35.391
Stay away!

46:28.932 --> 46:30.766
Come on.

46:33.141 --> 46:35.057
Come on.

46:39.182 --> 46:40.599
Come on.

46:41.599 --> 46:43.432
Whit!

47:00.599 --> 47:04.474
Hey, Whit... I can hear you breathing.

47:05.766 --> 47:07.307
I can hear your heart beating.

47:19.140 --> 47:20.349
Whit!

48:05.974 --> 48:08.015
Where are you?

48:25.015 --> 48:27.307
Carmichael!

48:32.474 --> 48:34.432
You told me this place was secure!

48:36.224 --> 48:37.957
Whit!

48:38.057 --> 48:40.015
Carmichael!

48:40.557 --> 48:42.432
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

48:42.807 --> 48:47.015
I just wanna talk to you. I just wanna talk
to you for a second. I need your help.

48:47.140 --> 48:50.515
We could help each other.
I can help you.

48:51.432 --> 48:55.557
Come on. Come on. I'm sorry.

48:57.015 --> 49:01.099
I don't know what to do.
You're a dead man.

49:03.890 --> 49:06.765
Your chances are done.
You're a dead man.

49:07.140 --> 49:10.265
- Whit, I can hear you breathing.
- Blood's on your hands.

49:10.390 --> 49:12.374
You're a dead man. You killed us.

49:12.474 --> 49:14.249
You lied to me!

49:14.349 --> 49:16.474
You killed my team!

49:16.765 --> 49:19.557
Whit! I'm coming for you!

49:37.307 --> 49:41.182
Whit! I'm coming for you!

49:43.557 --> 49:45.432
Whit!

49:47.849 --> 49:50.807
You're a fucking parasite!

49:51.640 --> 49:54.890
Dependant. Weak.

50:00.140 --> 50:02.224
I got you!

50:09.265 --> 50:11.307
Game over!

50:32.974 --> 50:34.682
Whit!

54:04.473 --> 54:08.057
Mineral opus classified
as frozen organic life form.

54:09.182 --> 54:11.181
Primordial ooze.

54:11.848 --> 54:14.681
Liquefies at minus ten degrees Celsius.

54:15.640 --> 54:18.640
Affliction immediate after exposure.

54:18.931 --> 54:21.973
Typical transgression,
30 seconds to three minutes.

54:22.848 --> 54:27.098
Longer resistance observed in select
subjects who displayed advanced...

54:27.223 --> 54:30.056
advanced emotional stability.

54:30.681 --> 54:34.056
Longest known resistance, two hours.

54:36.098 --> 54:40.265
Chaos chain reaction with organic matter,
unpredictable results.

54:40.473 --> 54:44.015
Will replicate tissue,
blood and organs over time.

54:45.431 --> 54:49.265
Host dependant,
initial diagnosis is parasitic.

54:50.431 --> 54:52.723
Incorrect evaluation.

54:53.473 --> 54:56.556
Controls host until
new balance restored.

54:56.681 --> 55:00.181
Complete dominance, highly-evolutionary
based, instinct predatory.

55:00.515 --> 55:02.498
Self-sustaining.

55:02.598 --> 55:06.265
Perfect organism. Perfect organism.

55:07.015 --> 55:09.098
Perfect organism.

55:14.223 --> 55:17.431
Case study one, pure specimen.

55:18.515 --> 55:20.848
Introduced single cell
of human blood culture.

55:20.973 --> 55:24.431
Within one hour, human
circulatory network formed...

55:24.556 --> 55:27.890
with signs of potential
for a basic nervous system.

55:28.015 --> 55:30.598
Snap frozen in 82 minutes.

55:30.931 --> 55:32.831
Case study two,

55:32.931 --> 55:35.515
introduced multiple cells
of human blood culture.

55:37.181 --> 55:40.331
Organism demonstrated
alpha properties...

55:40.431 --> 55:42.723
and attacked itself...

55:44.515 --> 55:46.681
to establish...

55:47.556 --> 55:50.806
a single dominant cell.

Signed Montoli J Reese,
IPE Science Unit.

56:45.890 --> 56:47.706
- No!
- Release the fucking gun

56:47.806 --> 56:52.056
or I snap your neck! Three, two, one!

56:53.598 --> 56:57.540
- Are you infected? Whit! Answer me!
- No! No, no...

56:57.640 --> 57:00.790
- Are you sure about that?
- Yes, I'm fucking sure!

57:00.890 --> 57:02.665
My gun will be on you.

57:02.765 --> 57:06.706
Move suddenly and I shoot.
No hesi-fucking-tation!

57:06.806 --> 57:08.040
- You don't move!
- Yes!

57:08.140 --> 57:11.515
- Answer me, you fucking got it?
- Just fucking let me go!

57:17.390 --> 57:18.681
Now get up!

57:20.306 --> 57:22.848
Show me those hands!

57:27.723 --> 57:30.390
You look like fucking shit.

57:31.223 --> 57:35.640
How the fuck do you expect me to look?
You don't look so fucking great yourself.

57:36.348 --> 57:39.806
- How did you find me?
- I was in here before you arrived.

57:40.265 --> 57:42.789
- You were in the locker the whole time?
- Only when I heard footsteps.

57:42.889 --> 57:45.056
Can't trust anyone right now.

57:46.431 --> 57:49.639
- Can I put my hands down now?
- How did you avoid exposure?

57:50.931 --> 57:54.139
- Answer me!
- Easy! Easy! Easy! Easy! Easy!

57:54.264 --> 57:56.639
I was in the control room.
I was on the other side of the room.

57:56.764 --> 57:59.956
The ship went down on one side,
I was over there talking to you, remember?

58:00.056 --> 58:02.206
Daddy loves you to the Milky Way.

58:02.306 --> 58:04.889
The long way,
not the fucking short way, remember?

58:05.598 --> 58:09.639
Remember? We were talking.
I was talking to you.

58:12.806 --> 58:15.431
How did you end up with Morgan's gun?

58:16.931 --> 58:18.639
Look at me!

58:19.056 --> 58:21.431
How did you end up with Morgan's gun?

58:21.556 --> 58:23.414
Everyone else got infected.

58:23.514 --> 58:25.873
Everyone. There was blood everywhere.

58:25.973 --> 58:28.998
I don't know about Morgan. I don't know
how he got infected. But I saw him.

58:29.098 --> 58:32.331
Morgan attacked Charlie right in front
of me. They didn't know I was there.

58:32.431 --> 58:35.764
Morgan... Morgan killed Charlie.

58:37.889 --> 58:42.681
He left him. He left his gun
and I took it and I ran. I swear.

58:45.056 --> 58:47.056
You got any idea
what the fuck's going on?

58:48.264 --> 58:50.181
I'm starting to.

58:54.056 --> 58:55.889
In there.

59:01.598 --> 59:05.848
So that would make
this entire planet a living entity.

59:07.139 --> 59:09.598
Only when it's thawed, yeah.

59:11.223 --> 59:14.598
Kind of explains why they tried
to mine it as a fuel source.

59:15.181 --> 59:17.348
It's highly combustible.

59:18.056 --> 59:20.556
Only not in the way they want.

59:23.348 --> 59:26.014
I've never heard of anything like this.

59:27.598 --> 59:30.414
You never had sea monkeys as a kid?

59:30.514 --> 59:32.639
It's just like them.

59:35.723 --> 59:39.056
Basically, they're saying
that it's like an archetype of life.

59:39.181 --> 59:42.306
Extreme evolution, wherever it goes,
whatever it touches.

59:43.348 --> 59:45.973
So why is everyone getting so fucked up?

59:46.098 --> 59:48.664
I think because its basic instinct
is predatory.

59:48.764 --> 59:51.206
It's looking for an alpha among us.

59:51.306 --> 59:54.456
Something from which it can grow,
can evolve.

59:54.556 --> 59:58.639
It just wants to exist. It doesn't realize
the consequence to us.

59:58.973 --> 01:00:01.039
I doubt it would care, either.

01:00:01.139 --> 01:00:03.848
It's not capable of understanding.

01:00:04.223 --> 01:00:05.723
Not yet, anyway.

01:00:07.181 --> 01:00:09.223
Like a cancer.

01:00:10.889 --> 01:00:13.181
How do we stop it?

01:00:14.764 --> 01:00:17.056
I don't think we can.

01:00:18.889 --> 01:00:21.389
I think we need to get home.

01:00:22.098 --> 01:00:25.348
Report this place, make sure
that no one ever comes back.

01:00:26.889 --> 01:00:29.806
It's not like this place
is on any random route.

01:00:29.931 --> 01:00:32.998
Just... lock it up.

01:00:33.098 --> 01:00:35.598
Throw away the key, you know?

01:00:36.431 --> 01:00:37.639
Oh, man!

01:00:37.764 --> 01:00:39.956
- You okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:00:40.056 --> 01:00:42.098
I took a fall. I...

01:00:42.556 --> 01:00:44.514
- busted a rib.
- Where?

01:00:44.639 --> 01:00:48.639
I was running down the corridor,
I went to jump and I tripped. I...

01:00:48.764 --> 01:00:51.139
broke a rib. I'm sure of it.

01:00:51.931 --> 01:00:54.723
When I was running from the control room,
when I yelled at you.

01:00:54.848 --> 01:00:57.348
Remember when I told you to stay away?

01:00:57.681 --> 01:00:59.889
It was just after that.

01:01:00.264 --> 01:01:03.514
It's okay. I'm sorry.

01:01:09.348 --> 01:01:11.681
This thing could replicate
anything organic, right?

01:01:11.806 --> 01:01:12.956
Yeah.

01:01:13.056 --> 01:01:16.764
Basically, it could create a complete
human being with enough time, yeah?

01:01:17.347 --> 01:01:19.472
With enough time, yeah.

01:01:20.347 --> 01:01:23.639
Seet and Chester are the only ones
who can dial in an early extraction.

01:01:24.222 --> 01:01:27.706
We've gotta find Chester. He's our man.

01:01:27.806 --> 01:01:30.597
Chester, if he's still alive,
and if he's on our side, then, yeah.

01:01:30.722 --> 01:01:32.931
And on our side?

01:01:36.639 --> 01:01:39.097
If we pull them out early...

01:01:41.306 --> 01:01:43.681
what about quarantine at the other end?

01:01:45.139 --> 01:01:48.056
I would rather take my chances there...

01:01:49.056 --> 01:01:51.306
than another minute here.

01:01:55.181 --> 01:01:57.122
I took these from operations.

01:01:57.222 --> 01:02:00.306
We should start with control
and see if he's there.

01:02:12.639 --> 01:02:16.139
- Rex!
- Put it down! Put it down!

01:02:17.056 --> 01:02:20.556
No, no, no, Rex! Rex!
Rex, don't. Don't do this.

01:02:21.639 --> 01:02:24.472
Put it down!

01:02:35.806 --> 01:02:38.597
Can you make choices, Whit?

01:02:39.764 --> 01:02:42.306
Where do you wanna go? Answer me.

01:02:44.847 --> 01:02:49.139
- I'm going home. We need to get home.
- I am home!

01:02:57.222 --> 01:03:00.514
It... sees you, Whit.

01:03:01.514 --> 01:03:04.889
- What?
- What is life, Whit?

01:03:05.014 --> 01:03:06.806
I want the answer.

01:03:07.889 --> 01:03:09.706
What is it?

01:03:09.806 --> 01:03:11.764
It's everything.

01:03:11.889 --> 01:03:18.597
You stand there, you fuck,
like you fucking are so important.

01:03:18.722 --> 01:03:21.622
You are so important.

01:03:21.722 --> 01:03:25.347
You are nothing, Whit.

01:03:25.806 --> 01:03:28.181
I will tell you what life is.

01:03:29.639 --> 01:03:31.722
- Hey, hey, hey... easy!
- Who is that?

01:03:31.847 --> 01:03:35.081
That is Menzies. He is part of your team.
Don't do this! You have a choice!

01:03:35.181 --> 01:03:37.664
Oh, shut up! Fuck!

01:03:37.764 --> 01:03:40.889
You're a fucking... liar!

01:03:41.014 --> 01:03:42.764
Lie! Fuck!

01:03:45.306 --> 01:03:47.181
Look at me!

01:03:47.889 --> 01:03:50.681
I am here because of you!

01:03:51.431 --> 01:03:52.306
I'm sorry.

01:03:52.431 --> 01:03:57.556
Every day protect you! Protect you!

01:04:03.431 --> 01:04:04.431
Rex.

01:04:07.764 --> 01:04:10.372
What the fuck are you doing, Rex? Rex...

01:04:10.472 --> 01:04:13.164
I've got a little girl
waiting for me, Rex.

01:04:13.264 --> 01:04:17.181
- You met her, Rex. You met her.
- I don't care.

01:04:20.722 --> 01:04:25.139
Rex, he's part of your team.
He's your friend.

01:04:25.597 --> 01:04:27.972
Don't you kill him.
You have a choice not to kill him.

01:04:29.972 --> 01:04:31.806
Harris.

01:04:33.056 --> 01:04:35.581
It's Harris. It's your friend.
It's your friend! It's your friend!

01:04:35.681 --> 01:04:38.306
- He's on your team.
- Rex. Rex.

01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:42.139
Life, Whit.

01:04:42.597 --> 01:04:46.372
We've got a way out of here.
We've got a way out.

01:04:46.472 --> 01:04:48.347
Life, Whit.

01:04:53.639 --> 01:04:56.847
This moment...

01:04:57.264 --> 01:04:59.472
right now, Whit...

01:05:00.305 --> 01:05:01.555
is life...

01:05:02.472 --> 01:05:04.164
and life...

01:05:04.264 --> 01:05:08.472
is nothing... without choice.

01:05:35.055 --> 01:05:39.539
Fuck! Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

01:05:39.639 --> 01:05:42.997
Whit, please! Whit, don't leave me here!

01:05:43.097 --> 01:05:45.889
All the way to the Milky Way.

01:05:46.014 --> 01:05:49.055
Not the short way, but the long way!

01:05:52.889 --> 01:05:54.305
Menzies!

01:05:55.764 --> 01:05:57.889
I can't help you now.

01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:00.639
We can't help each other.

01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:04.680
What the fuck would you know?

01:06:05.805 --> 01:06:09.430
You lied to me. You lied to my crew.

01:06:09.555 --> 01:06:11.639
You lied to my Emma.

01:06:11.764 --> 01:06:13.764
Oh, please!

01:06:13.889 --> 01:06:17.164
Please! I'll hunt you down...

01:06:17.264 --> 01:06:20.872
and blow your fucking larynx
through your skull!

01:06:20.972 --> 01:06:24.097
I had you right in my sights...

01:06:24.305 --> 01:06:27.472
you fucking little cocksucker!

01:07:25.347 --> 01:07:29.180
What are you, Whit?

01:07:30.055 --> 01:07:33.472
And I promise that I'll be home
for dinner tonight.

01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:42.097
Murderer! Murderer...

01:07:51.430 --> 01:07:54.347
I just want you to know
I'm proud of you.

01:07:57.347 --> 01:07:59.680
You mean the world to me.

01:08:00.555 --> 01:08:02.622
You're my kids.

01:08:02.722 --> 01:08:04.889
You proud of me?

01:08:05.014 --> 01:08:06.514
You're my little ones.

01:08:08.597 --> 01:08:11.055
Killed in a dream.

01:08:11.972 --> 01:08:14.955
And what we did here was special.

01:08:15.055 --> 01:08:17.513
And it meant something.

01:08:21.055 --> 01:08:23.638
You get me the fuck
out of here right now.

01:08:23.763 --> 01:08:27.263
I'm talking to my fucking kids,
motherfucker!

01:08:29.388 --> 01:08:31.096
You're scaring them.

01:08:33.596 --> 01:08:36.055
I just wanna say I love you.

01:08:36.346 --> 01:08:38.388
You are special.

01:08:39.221 --> 01:08:42.263
Damn, I would've loved
to have seen you grow up.

01:08:42.596 --> 01:08:45.638
Okay, I better go.
I got some stuff to do.

01:08:45.763 --> 01:08:47.888
Take care of your ma.

01:08:52.346 --> 01:08:54.346
How did you do that?

01:08:55.846 --> 01:08:57.705
Radio transmission.

01:08:57.805 --> 01:09:02.497
- Radio won't get there for centuries.
- I know. It's like a message in a bottle.

01:09:02.596 --> 01:09:05.805
But I had to throw
that bottle in the water.

01:09:07.930 --> 01:09:11.305
Take a seat. I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:09:12.638 --> 01:09:14.888
Take a seat.

01:09:22.763 --> 01:09:25.763
Menzies said you could call
for an early extraction.

01:09:26.471 --> 01:09:28.388
I already did.

01:09:35.221 --> 01:09:37.263
We're going home.

01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:41.305
Yeah.

01:09:42.221 --> 01:09:43.721
Yeah.

01:09:43.846 --> 01:09:47.721
Yeah. Okay, okay, you just pointed
a gun at my fucking head.

01:09:47.846 --> 01:09:51.221
Now you're patting me on the back?
What the fuck, man?

01:09:52.596 --> 01:09:58.472
It's just eight hours more
in this fucking hole. Eight hours.

01:09:59.763 --> 01:10:04.555
Time to go home! Relay! Recode!
20 seconds! Eight hours!

01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:08.638
Eight! Eight! Eight!

01:10:09.013 --> 01:10:10.555
What?

01:10:11.722 --> 01:10:13.555
What, are you meditating?

01:10:13.888 --> 01:10:16.305
We won't make eight hours.

01:10:16.597 --> 01:10:18.513
Fuck, we'll be lucky to make two!

01:10:19.305 --> 01:10:21.805
- This'll kill you.
- Oh, yeah?

01:10:23.430 --> 01:10:25.830
I saw some things.
I saw some things in the med bay.

01:10:25.930 --> 01:10:28.830
I don't fucking understand
what they are, I don't know that shit,

01:10:28.930 --> 01:10:33.388
but if we had a medic...
we have a medic... Do we have a medic?

01:10:33.888 --> 01:10:36.597
I wish I was as strong as you, Whit.

01:10:37.513 --> 01:10:39.997
Where are you going, Whit?

01:10:40.097 --> 01:10:42.622
The only chance we have...

01:10:42.722 --> 01:10:46.330
is finding a medic,
getting to the med bay...

01:10:46.430 --> 01:10:48.513
- and slowing this fucking thing down.
- We need a medic!

01:10:48.638 --> 01:10:52.097
- I need a fucking medic!
- Where the fuck is the medic? Medic!

01:10:52.222 --> 01:10:54.288
Medic!

01:10:54.388 --> 01:10:58.472
- Who's the fucking medic?
- Oh, Claire's the medic.

01:10:59.180 --> 01:11:04.222
Claire the medic is going to save
the day. Is that what you think?

01:11:05.263 --> 01:11:07.205
- I don't know. I don't know.
- You don't know?

01:11:07.305 --> 01:11:09.288
- So now it's just a fucking theory?
- Yeah.

01:11:09.388 --> 01:11:13.038
It's a fucking theory! Hey, everybody,
we got a fucking theory!

01:11:13.138 --> 01:11:15.163
This thing...

01:11:15.263 --> 01:11:17.888
it takes you over.

01:11:18.013 --> 01:11:20.680
Until there's only one left, just one.

01:11:20.805 --> 01:11:26.055
It will thrive on conflict and it will
take over until it finds its alpha.

01:11:26.555 --> 01:11:29.955
We've got a head count at five.
There's you, me...

01:11:30.055 --> 01:11:33.013
Morgan, Claire...

01:11:33.347 --> 01:11:35.722
and then the female lieutenant.

01:11:35.847 --> 01:11:38.638
Boxen? No, she's not here. I killed her.

01:11:44.721 --> 01:11:46.621
- We need to get to the med bay.
- No, no, no...

01:11:46.721 --> 01:11:48.788
- Come with me! I need you...
- I can't come with you.

01:11:48.888 --> 01:11:51.121
- We need to slow it down.
- No, no, no, no.

01:11:51.221 --> 01:11:53.888
I can't fucking be here anymore!
I want you to trust me.

01:11:54.013 --> 01:11:55.888
- You want me... to trust you?
- Yeah.

01:11:56.013 --> 01:11:59.538
Look at the size of this fucking gun!
Get some fucking balls!

01:11:59.638 --> 01:12:01.788
Fuck off, Whit,
I don't wanna fight, man.

01:12:01.888 --> 01:12:04.288
I will have your back. I promise you.

01:12:04.388 --> 01:12:07.788
You'll have my fucking back?
You point a fucking gun in my head...

01:12:07.888 --> 01:12:11.055
"Oh, I got your back. I got your back."
You are very fucking inconsistent.

01:12:11.180 --> 01:12:12.996
- Together. Together.
- No. No.

01:12:13.096 --> 01:12:15.871
- Come on, man. We do it together!
- Are we in a fucking relationship?

01:12:15.971 --> 01:12:17.455
We're not gonna do shit together!

01:12:17.555 --> 01:12:19.371
Menzies said you could call
for an early extraction.

01:12:19.471 --> 01:12:23.246
I already did that.
Didn't you hear me the first time?

01:12:23.346 --> 01:12:26.221
- Do you wanna put a gun to my head?
- No.

01:12:26.846 --> 01:12:29.471
Yes. No.

01:12:30.971 --> 01:12:34.596
Sit down! Sit the fuck down!

01:12:34.721 --> 01:12:36.180
Sit down!

01:12:37.513 --> 01:12:40.830
You know I've got a fucking wife!
I told you about my fucking wife!

01:12:40.930 --> 01:12:42.846
Is that a fucking joke?

01:12:48.180 --> 01:12:50.596
What did you say again?

01:12:50.888 --> 01:12:52.705
- Med bay. You, me, now.
- Med bay.

01:12:52.805 --> 01:12:54.430
- Come on.
- Fuck, no.

01:12:54.555 --> 01:12:56.763
You know what? I can smell your fear.

01:12:56.888 --> 01:13:00.513
I'm going by myself.
You can do whatever the fuck you want!

01:13:02.180 --> 01:13:03.930
Whit!

01:13:08.263 --> 01:13:10.096
Whit!

01:13:11.721 --> 01:13:14.346
Whit! Whit!

01:13:17.471 --> 01:13:19.221
Whit?

01:13:20.096 --> 01:13:22.413
Whit? I'm gonna blow
the external vents, Whit!

01:13:22.513 --> 01:13:24.913
I'm gonna fucking do it!
Come on, let's play.

01:13:25.013 --> 01:13:29.471
I was thinking of making you my best friend.
Whit, come on, don't walk away!

01:14:56.430 --> 01:14:59.013
What happened to us?

01:15:03.513 --> 01:15:06.805
I won't let anything happen to us, okay?

01:15:07.721 --> 01:15:09.513
I promise.

01:15:15.138 --> 01:15:16.471
The three of us.

01:15:29.846 --> 01:15:32.138
The baby's gone, Morgan.

01:15:33.846 --> 01:15:36.346
I had to get rid of it.

01:15:38.971 --> 01:15:40.954
I had to do it!

01:15:41.054 --> 01:15:44.471
It was inside the baby!

01:15:59.388 --> 01:16:01.346
What did you do?

01:16:16.554 --> 01:16:20.679
- Morgan, I wanted to...
- Shut up. Shut up!

01:18:07.971 --> 01:18:09.388
Morgan.

01:18:18.638 --> 01:18:20.554
The medic.

01:18:21.054 --> 01:18:22.846
Claire?

01:18:24.721 --> 01:18:26.554
Claire?

01:18:39.637 --> 01:18:42.012
- Claire?
- Is she dead?

01:18:42.429 --> 01:18:44.554
- Claire?
- Medic!

01:18:46.554 --> 01:18:48.596
Did you do that to Morgan?

01:18:50.387 --> 01:18:52.512
He left me no choice.

01:18:57.012 --> 01:18:58.512
Whit...

01:19:00.221 --> 01:19:02.512
I'm so sorry.

01:19:04.262 --> 01:19:06.762
We were supposed to get you home.

01:19:07.471 --> 01:19:10.221
You can still help me. Claire, listen...

01:19:10.346 --> 01:19:14.429
You need to tell me
how we slow this thing down. Please.

01:19:14.846 --> 01:19:16.429
It's too smart.

01:19:16.971 --> 01:19:20.704
Tell me something you haven't tried.
Tell me something crazy.

01:19:20.804 --> 01:19:23.887
I mean, anything crazy,
like a... like...

01:19:24.012 --> 01:19:25.496
some kind of drug,

01:19:25.596 --> 01:19:29.454
or a cleaning solution, an apoc agent,
anything, please. Please.

01:19:29.554 --> 01:19:31.346
Ma...

01:19:38.304 --> 01:19:41.454
I don't understand. I don't understand
what you're saying. What are you saying?

01:19:41.554 --> 01:19:44.721
- She's saying goodbye to her mum.
- What the fuck would you know?

01:19:46.596 --> 01:19:48.121
Please.

01:19:48.221 --> 01:19:50.554
Tell me something crazy
that you haven't tried.

01:19:53.512 --> 01:19:55.137
Death.

01:19:57.887 --> 01:19:59.554
Hey.

01:20:09.221 --> 01:20:10.804
She's dead, Whit.

01:20:11.512 --> 01:20:13.887
Please. Please.

01:20:14.471 --> 01:20:16.846
It's just you and me.

01:20:17.887 --> 01:20:20.387
No, no, no, no.

01:20:58.054 --> 01:20:59.346
Whit!

01:21:01.554 --> 01:21:03.596
Where are you going?

01:21:06.137 --> 01:21:07.971
You threw a chair at my head, Whit!

01:21:09.221 --> 01:21:10.887
Naughty!

01:21:16.721 --> 01:21:18.429
I'm putting my gun down, Whit.

01:21:19.221 --> 01:21:21.679
It's too fucking heavy, anyway.

01:21:28.096 --> 01:21:29.954
Talk to me!

01:21:30.054 --> 01:21:33.512
Come on, you threw a chair at my head.
I just wanna know why.

01:21:33.929 --> 01:21:35.596
Whit!

01:21:49.096 --> 01:21:52.387
I'm willing to forgive you.
Come here. Come here, Whit.

01:21:52.512 --> 01:21:57.012
Come out! Got nothing, Whit!
Fucking empty-handed, man! Got no gun!

01:21:58.596 --> 01:21:59.929
Fuck you, Whit!

01:22:09.804 --> 01:22:11.512
I know.

01:22:15.804 --> 01:22:17.720
I know.

01:22:45.387 --> 01:22:46.720
Come on.

01:22:51.054 --> 01:22:54.429
...and play, Whit. Play with me.

01:23:33.595 --> 01:23:36.137
One left. No hard feelings.

01:23:44.679 --> 01:23:46.304
Thought you were winning!

01:23:53.887 --> 01:23:55.929
You wanna play?

01:24:07.137 --> 01:24:10.137
Medic! Medic!

01:24:10.262 --> 01:24:12.887
I'm just fucking with you.
I'm fucking with you.

01:24:20.804 --> 01:24:23.412
You thought you were gonna win.

01:24:23.512 --> 01:24:25.304
I'm playing with you, Whit!

01:24:31.637 --> 01:24:34.179
I know! I know!

01:27:32.137 --> 01:27:35.095
Whatever you were trying to do here...

01:27:37.553 --> 01:27:39.303
you've failed.

01:27:43.137 --> 01:27:45.428
I know you're listening.

01:27:50.720 --> 01:27:55.053
You could've chosen
any part of any one of us.

01:27:58.220 --> 01:28:01.887
But you chose the worst parts
of human behavior...

01:28:03.053 --> 01:28:05.428
to use as your voice.

01:28:08.220 --> 01:28:10.095
You choose hatred.

01:28:10.220 --> 01:28:12.453
You chose violence.

01:28:12.553 --> 01:28:14.762
You chose conflict.

01:28:16.303 --> 01:28:19.595
You had an inability to see
the bigger picture.

01:28:22.220 --> 01:28:25.178
You had a down-right fucking refusal...

01:28:25.553 --> 01:28:27.845
to see beyond the present.

01:28:30.387 --> 01:28:35.553
You couldn't get past your own selfish,
ignorant need to dominate.

01:28:37.637 --> 01:28:40.012
If you had had time to...

01:28:41.178 --> 01:28:43.262
grow...

01:28:43.387 --> 01:28:45.928
time to evolve...

01:28:50.053 --> 01:28:52.553
things could've been different.

01:28:54.845 --> 01:28:57.095
If we could've...

01:28:58.387 --> 01:29:00.428
worked together...

01:29:02.762 --> 01:29:05.262
I was never meant to be here.

01:29:06.178 --> 01:29:09.511
All I was trying to do was make
a better life for my family.

01:29:13.053 --> 01:29:15.803
And you took that away from me.

01:29:16.261 --> 01:29:19.095
You took it away from everyone.

01:29:20.928 --> 01:29:23.886
And now look where it's got us.

01:29:25.511 --> 01:29:28.470
Look at me, I'm not a fucking soldier.

01:29:31.553 --> 01:29:34.636
I grew up fucking studying computers.

01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:39.636
I grew up writing computer games.

01:29:41.511 --> 01:29:44.386
That's what I wanted to do, play games.

01:29:48.386 --> 01:29:51.803
I wanted to grow up
and play games with my son.

01:29:56.053 --> 01:29:58.595
Why don't I hate you for that?

01:30:08.220 --> 01:30:10.636
My name is Whit Carmichael.

01:30:13.053 --> 01:30:15.786
I had you in my fucking sights,
you little fucking cocksucker!

01:30:15.886 --> 01:30:17.495
Whit Carmichael, this is Philipa Boxen.

01:30:17.595 --> 01:30:21.536
Put your hands where I can see them,
Carmichael! Medic!

01:30:21.636 --> 01:30:25.136
What is life, Whit? What is life, Whit?

01:30:27.136 --> 01:30:29.470
You come home to us at the end.

01:31:14.261 --> 01:31:17.053
Whatever you were trying to do here...

01:31:18.261 --> 01:31:20.136
you've failed.

01:31:22.553 --> 01:31:24.886
I know you're listening.

01:31:26.636 --> 01:31:28.845
You could've chosen...

01:31:28.970 --> 01:31:31.803
any part of any one of us.

01:31:32.595 --> 01:31:36.470
But you chose the worst parts
of human behavior...

01:31:37.470 --> 01:31:39.220
to use as your voice.

01:31:40.886 --> 01:31:45.303
You chose hatred. You chose violence.

01:31:46.386 --> 01:31:48.428
You chose conflict.

01:31:52.053 --> 01:31:55.511
You had an inability to see
the bigger picture.

01:31:58.761 --> 01:32:01.720
You had a down-right fucking refusal...

01:32:01.970 --> 01:32:04.345
to see beyond the present.

01:32:06.845 --> 01:32:12.661
You couldn't get past your own selfish,
ignorant need to dominate.

01:32:12.761 --> 01:32:15.120
If you had had time to...

01:32:15.220 --> 01:32:17.178
grow...

01:32:17.386 --> 01:32:19.636
time to evolve...

01:32:22.220 --> 01:32:24.720
things could've been different.

01:32:28.136 --> 01:32:30.303
If we could've...

01:32:31.636 --> 01:32:33.636
worked together...

01:32:36.011 --> 01:32:38.386
I was never meant to be here.

01:32:39.469 --> 01:32:43.011
All I was trying to do was make
a better life for my family.

01:32:46.386 --> 01:32:49.136
And you took that away from me.

01:32:49.511 --> 01:32:51.678
You took it away from everyone.

01:32:53.053 --> 01:32:55.553
Why don't I hate you for that?

01:32:58.678 --> 01:33:01.553
Whatever you were trying to do here...

01:33:09.636 --> 01:33:11.678
Carmichael!

01:33:14.928 --> 01:33:17.303
Carmichael!

01:33:17.594 --> 01:33:19.511
Carmichael.

01:33:22.553 --> 01:33:25.928
The Cap wants us
in the control room ASAP.

01:33:31.261 --> 01:33:32.969
Get moving.

01:33:40.053 --> 01:33:41.594
It's gone.

01:35:14.594 --> 01:35:18.303
Praise be to... whoever.

01:35:19.011 --> 01:35:21.219
We're all good, sir.

01:35:35.428 --> 01:35:36.969
Good to see you, Whit.

01:35:43.511 --> 01:35:44.886
Cap.

01:35:45.928 --> 01:35:49.428
I wish I could tell you all
exactly what happened here.

01:35:50.969 --> 01:35:52.678
But I can't.

01:35:53.469 --> 01:35:56.386
There seems to be a period
of absence that was...

01:35:56.594 --> 01:35:58.678
when we were...

01:35:59.803 --> 01:36:01.969
incapacitated.

01:36:02.469 --> 01:36:05.469
I'm gonna put it down to pressurisation.

01:36:06.594 --> 01:36:09.469
Unless someone here
can tell me otherwise.

01:36:21.802 --> 01:36:23.594
No, sir.

01:36:24.469 --> 01:36:26.677
But what I can confirm...

01:36:27.469 --> 01:36:30.469
is that the payload
is permanently offline...

01:36:31.136 --> 01:36:33.369
the station is secure...

01:36:33.469 --> 01:36:37.594
and we have in our possession
Mr. Whit Carmichael.

01:36:38.136 --> 01:36:39.577
All objectives completed.

01:36:39.677 --> 01:36:43.886
Yeah, well, I can confirm I have the
greatest hangover in the history of ever.

01:36:46.344 --> 01:36:49.594
I'm reading early extraction in five.

01:36:50.052 --> 01:36:52.219
You mean five hours?

01:36:53.552 --> 01:36:55.469
Five minutes.

01:37:00.219 --> 01:37:02.052
Whit.

01:37:02.261 --> 01:37:04.202
Yes, sir?

01:37:04.302 --> 01:37:06.636
Is there anything you wanna tell us?

01:37:13.886 --> 01:37:15.761
No, sir.

01:37:16.469 --> 01:37:18.844
You sure about that? Nothing at all?

01:37:25.469 --> 01:37:26.927
Positive.

01:37:32.177 --> 01:37:34.177
All right, team...

01:37:34.677 --> 01:37:39.177
listen to me carefully.
We make the report simple.

01:37:39.636 --> 01:37:43.344
And we do our best to make sure no one
ever comes back to this antique shit hole.

01:37:43.469 --> 01:37:46.219
- Yeah, agreed.
- I'm fine with that.

01:37:46.594 --> 01:37:48.636
All right, let's move.

01:38:37.802 --> 01:38:41.661
Keep your distance.
Make the signal clean.

01:38:41.761 --> 01:38:44.011
We're out in ten...

01:38:44.886 --> 01:38:46.719
nine...

01:38:47.844 --> 01:38:49.677
eight...

01:38:50.594 --> 01:38:52.469
seven...

01:38:53.427 --> 01:38:55.302
six...

01:38:55.969 --> 01:38:57.719
five...

01:38:58.927 --> 01:39:00.636
four...

01:39:01.636 --> 01:39:03.469
three...

01:39:06.094 --> 01:39:07.886
two...

01:39:12.136 --> 01:39:13.927
one.

01:39:26.969 --> 01:39:31.344
Step forward, please.
Sir, take your eyeline to me.

01:39:31.469 --> 01:39:33.844
One minute and I'll have you home.
One minute.

01:39:33.969 --> 01:39:35.844
- What is your name?
- Lieutenant Philipa Boxen.

01:39:35.969 --> 01:39:39.702
I'm going to ask you a series of questions.
I advise you to take your eyes to me.

01:39:39.802 --> 01:39:43.302
- You know where you are?
- What is your name and date of birth.

01:39:43.427 --> 01:39:46.344
- Seet Johanson.
- What is your name?

01:39:46.469 --> 01:39:48.469
- Claire Grenich.
- Harris Menzies.

01:39:48.594 --> 01:39:51.285
- Tell me your date of birth.
- Place your hand on the glass.

01:39:51.385 --> 01:39:53.452
I need your full cooperation
before I can clear you.

01:39:53.552 --> 01:39:56.244
- Charlie Kent.
- What's your name, sir?

01:39:56.344 --> 01:39:57.635
- Rex Mannings.
- Good.

01:39:57.760 --> 01:40:00.802
- You look angry. Why are you angry?
- What is your name and date of birth?

01:40:00.927 --> 01:40:03.510
- How many children do you have?
- I have one on the way.

01:40:03.635 --> 01:40:05.802
- Do you know where you are?
- East Coast Headquarters.

01:40:05.927 --> 01:40:09.177
- What was your mission?
- To collect one Whit Carmichael.

01:40:09.302 --> 01:40:12.244
And the payload. Got it?

01:40:12.344 --> 01:40:16.177
- If you do not calm down, I cannot help you!
- You can't tell I'm calm?

01:40:16.302 --> 01:40:19.802
Were you exposed to any foreign contaminants
on mission that you are aware of?

01:40:19.927 --> 01:40:21.552
No.

01:40:22.052 --> 01:40:27.177
Jacklar! Look at me. Were you exposed?
I need you to stay on me.

01:40:28.094 --> 01:40:29.802
No.

01:40:30.385 --> 01:40:33.535
- If you are lying to me, I will know.
- I'm not lying.

01:40:33.635 --> 01:40:37.369
- Sir, please answer the questions.
- Mannings, answer the question!

01:40:37.469 --> 01:40:39.119
- Negative.
- No.

01:40:39.219 --> 01:40:40.660
- Were you exposed?
- No!

01:40:40.760 --> 01:40:44.135
- I don't think so.
- Place your hand on the barrier.

01:40:44.927 --> 01:40:46.010
What is your name?

01:40:46.135 --> 01:40:49.910
I can't get a clear reading
if you don't calm down!

01:40:50.010 --> 01:40:53.510
